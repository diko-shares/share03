{6197}{6279}{y:i}This is a story of an ordinary little boy...
{6283}{6356}{y:i}... named Charlie Bucket.
{6372}{6480}{y:i}He was not faster or stronger|{y:i}or more clever than other children.
{6528}{6643}{y:i}His family was not rich|{y:i}or powerful or well-connected.
{6647}{6738}{y:i}In fact, they barely had enough to eat.
{6763}{6869}{y:i}Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy|{y:i}in the entire world.
{6873}{6930}{y:i}He just didn't know it yet.
{7336}{7376}- Evening, Buckets.|- Evening.
{7380}{7415}Hi, Dad.
{7465}{7519}Soup's almost ready, darling.
{7533}{7611}Don't suppose there's anything|extra to put in, love.
{7631}{7694}Oh, well. Nothing goes better|with cabbage than cabbage.
{7803}{7838}Charlie...
{7849}{7908}...I found something I think you'll like.
{7985}{8088}{y:i}Charlie's father worked|{y:i}at the local toothpaste factory.
{8092}{8188}{y:i}The hours were long,|{y:i}and the pay was terrible...
{8193}{8308}{y:i}... yet occasionally,|{y:i}there were unexpected surprises.
{8369}{8405}It's exactly what I need.
{8435}{8468}What is it, Charlie?
{8613}{8672}Dad found it, just the piece I needed.
{8677}{8748}- What piece was it?|- A head for Willy Wonka.
{8753}{8783}Well, how wonderful.
{8787}{8836}It's quite a likeness.
{8840}{8880}- You think so?|- Think so?
{8884}{8922}I know so.
{8926}{9014}I saw Willy Wonka|with my own two eyes.
{9018}{9073}- I used to work for him, you know.|- You did?
{9077}{9114}- I did.|- He did.
{9121}{9149}He did.
{9153}{9201}I love grapes.
{9209}{9310}Of course, I was a much|younger man in those days.
{9341}{9414}{y:i}Willy Wonka began with|{y:i}a single store on Cherry Street.
{9460}{9538}{y:i}But the whole world wanted his candy.
{9621}{9675}- Mr. Wonka.|- Yeah?
{9679}{9722}We need more Wonka bars...
{9726}{9818}...and we're out of chocolate birds.|- Birds?
{9825}{9856}Birds.
{9861}{9958}Well, then we'll need|to make some more. Here.
{10022}{10062}Now open.
{10161}{10212}The man was a genius.
{10224}{10328}Did you know he invented a new way|of making chocolate ice cream...
{10332}{10420}...so that it stays cold for hours|without a freezer?
{10424}{10532}You can even leave it lying in the sun|on a hot day, and it won't go runny.
{10553}{10629}- But that's impossible.|- But Willy Wonka did it.
{10704}{10732}{y:i}Before long...
{10765}{10823}{y:i}... he decided to build|{y:i}a proper chocolate factory.
{10827}{10900}{y:i}The largest chocolate factory in history.
{10905}{10984}{y:i}Fifty times as big as any other.
{11440}{11480}Grandpa, don't make it gross.
{11506}{11597}Tell him about the Indian prince.|He'd like to hear about that.
{11610}{11665}You mean, Prince Pondicherry?
{11681}{11784}Well, Prince Pondicherry|wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka...
{11793}{11853}...and asked him to come|all the way out to India...
{11864}{11968}...and build him a colossal palace|entirely out of chocolate.
{12087}{12195}It will have 100 rooms, and everything will|be made of either dark or light chocolate.
{12268}{12350}{y:i}True to his word,|{y:i}the bricks were chocolate...
{12354}{12420}{y:i}... and the cement holding|{y:i}them together was chocolate.
{12437}{12517}{y:i}All the walls and ceilings|{y:i}were made of chocolate as well.
{12550}{12631}{y:i}So were the carpets|{y:i}and the pictures and the furniture.
{12635}{12705}It is perfect in every way.
{12709}{12784}Yeah, but it won't last long.|You better start eating right now.
{12788}{12879}Oh, nonsense. I will not eat my palace.
{12883}{12963}I intend to live in it.
{13029}{13089}{y:i}But Mr. Wonka was right, of course.
{13105}{13228}{y:i}Soon after this, there came|{y:i}a very hot day with a boiling sun.
{14097}{14209}{y:i}The prince sent an urgent telegram|{y:i}requesting a new palace...
{14214}{14283}{y:i}... but Willy Wonka was facing|{y:i}problems of his own.
{14329}{14446}{y:i}All the other chocolate makers, you see,|{y:i}had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka.
{14450}{14564}{y:i}They began sending in spies|{y:i}to steal his secret recipes.
{15232}{15328}{y:i}Fickelgruber started making|{y:i}an ice cream that would never melt.
{15333}{15438}{y:i}Prodnose came out with a chewing gum|{y:i}that never lost its flavor.
{15442}{15508}{y:i}Then Slugworth|{y:i}began making candy balloons...
{15513}{15585}{y:i}... that you could blow up|{y:i}to incredible sizes.
{15607}{15660}{y:i}The thievery got so bad...
{15664}{15716}{y:i}... that one day, without warning...
{15720}{15829}{y:i}... Mr. Wonka told every single one|{y:i}of his workers to go home.
{15833}{15948}{y:i}He announced that he was closing|{y:i}his chocolate factory forever.
{15953}{16054}I'm closing my chocolate factory forever.
{16058}{16088}I'm sorry.
{16489}{16562}But it didn't close forever.|It's open right now.
{16566}{16668}Yes, well, sometimes when grownups say|"forever," they mean "a very long time. "
{16685}{16761}Such as, "I feel like I've eaten|nothing but cabbage soup forever. "
{16769}{16853}- Now, Pops.|- The factory did close, Charlie.
{16857}{16952}And it seemed like it was|going to be closed forever.
{16957}{17068}Then one day we saw smoke|rising from the chimneys.
{17073}{17166}- The factory was back in business.|- Did you get your job back?
{17186}{17221}No.
{17225}{17268}No one did.
{17352}{17396}But there must be people working there.
{17404}{17484}Think about it, Charlie.|Have you ever seen a single person...
{17489}{17553}...going into that factory|or coming out of it?
{17588}{17658}No. The gates are always closed.
{17662}{17702}Exactly.
{17716}{17766}But then, who's running the machines?
{17770}{17841}- Nobody knows, Charlie.|- It certainly is a mystery.
{17858}{17901}Hasn't someone asked Mr. Wonka?
{17926}{18014}Nobody sees him anymore.|He never comes out.
{18033}{18136}The only thing that comes|out of that place is the candy...
{18140}{18200}...already packed and addressed.
{18216}{18335}I'd give anything in the world|just to go in one more time...
{18339}{18437}...and see what's become|of that amazing factory.
{18461}{18546}Well, you won't, because you can't.|No one can.
{18557}{18645}It's a mystery,|and it will always be a mystery.
{18656}{18764}That little factory of yours, Charlie,|is as close as any of us is ever going to get.
{18805}{18893}Come on, Charlie. I think it's time|we let your grandparents get some sleep.
{18952}{19019}- Good night, Grandpa George.|- Night, Charlie.
{19023}{19073}- Night-night.|- Chair.
{19077}{19122}Thank you, dear.
{19161}{19204}Night, Grandpa Joe.
{19249}{19292}Good night, Grandma Georgina.
{19297}{19373}Nothing's impossible, Charlie.
{19782}{19840}- Good night.|- Night, Charlie.
{19844}{19882}Sleep well.
{20135}{20273}{y:i}Indeed, that very night, the impossible|{y:i}had already been set in motion.
{21725}{21776}{y:i}Dear people of the world...
{21785}{21822}{y:i}... I, Willy Wonka...
{21831}{21937}{y:i}... have decided to allow five children|{y:i}to visit my factory this year.
{21941}{22028}{y:i}In addition, one of these children|{y:i}shall receive a special prize...
{22033}{22119}{y:i}... beyond anything|{y:i}you could ever imagine.
{22133}{22176}Five golden tickets have been hidden...
{22181}{22260}...underneath the ordinary wrapping paper|of five ordinary Wonka bars.
{22270}{22302}The bars may be anywhere...
{22335}{22460}...in any shop, in any street, in any|town, in any country in the world.
{23285}{23370}Wouldn't it be something, Charlie,|to open a bar of candy...
{23374}{23432}...and find a golden ticket inside?
{23440}{23550}I know, but I only get one bar a year,|for my birthday.
{23554}{23592}Well, it's your birthday next week.
{23607}{23680}You have as much chance|as anybody does.
{23684}{23754}Balderdash. The kids who are|going to find the golden tickets...
{23758}{23824}...are the ones who can afford|to buy candy bars every day.
{23829}{23927}Our Charlie gets only one a year.|He doesn't have a chance.
{23935}{23994}Everyone has a chance, Charlie.
{24004}{24093}Mark my words,|the kid who finds the first ticket...
{24097}{24160}...will be fat, fat, fat.
{24166}{24212}Augustus. This way.
{24331}{24378}I am eating the Wonka bar...
{24382}{24461}...and I taste something|that is not chocolate...
{24483}{24528}{y:i}... or coconut...
{24542}{24597}...or walnut or peanut butter...
{24609}{24655}{y:i}... or nougat...
{24665}{24772}...or butter brittle|or caramel or sprinkles.
{24807}{24850}{y:i}So I look...
{24884}{24920}...and I find the golden ticket.
{24925}{24977}Augustus, how did you celebrate?
{24993}{25047}I eat more candy.
{25125}{25193}We knew Augustus would find|the golden ticket.
{25209}{25263}He eats so many candy bars a day...
{25267}{25357}...that it was not possible|for him not to find one.
{25361}{25437}Yes, it is good, Augustus.
{25454}{25502}{y:i}- Golden ticket claimed and four more...
{25506}{25537}Told you it'd be a porker.
{25547}{25592}What a repulsive boy.
{25602}{25641}Only four golden tickets left.
{25646}{25757}Now that they've found one,|things will really get crazy.
{25761}{25809}{y:i}- Of every shape, size and hue.
{25904}{25967}Veruca. Can you spell that for us, please?
{25971}{26056}V-E-R-U-C-A. Veruca Salt.
{26093}{26184}As soon as my little Veruca told me she|had to have one of these golden tickets...
{26192}{26262}...I started buying all the Wonka bars|I could lay my hands on.
{26277}{26334}Thousands of them.|Hundreds of thousands.
{26353}{26444}I'm in the nut business, you see.|So I say to my workers:
{26458}{26531}Morning, ladies. From now on,|you can stop shelling peanuts...
{26535}{26610}...and start shelling the wrappers|off these chocolate bars instead.
{26959}{27031}{y:i}Three days went by, and we had no luck. |{y:i}Oh, it was terrible.
{27043}{27094}{y:i}My Veruca got more|{y:i}and more upset each day.
{27098}{27133}Where's my golden ticket?
{27137}{27192}I want my golden ticket.
{27230}{27316}Well, gentlemen, I just hated to see|my little girl feeling unhappy like that.
{27329}{27406}I vowed I would keep searching|until I could give her what she wanted.
{27441}{27521}{y:i}And finally, I found her a ticket.
{28157}{28236}Daddy, I want another pony.
{28282}{28330}She's even worse than the fat boy.
{28343}{28429}I don't think that was really fair.|She didn't find the ticket herself.
{28437}{28540}Don't worry about it, Charlie.|That man spoils his daughter.
{28550}{28642}And no good ever comes|from spoiling a child like that.
{28768}{28847}Charlie, Mum and I thought...
{28851}{28920}...maybe you wanna open|your birthday present tonight.
{29076}{29109}Here you are.
{29408}{29444}Maybe I should wait till morning.
{29451}{29493}- Like hell.|- Pop.
{29505}{29636}All together, we're 381 years old.|We don't wait.
{29829}{29894}Now, Charlie,|you mustn't feel too disappointed...
{29898}{29946}...you know, if you don't get the...
{29950}{30000}Whatever happens,|you'll still have the candy.
{30709}{30748}Ah, well.
{30760}{30801}That's that.
{30844}{30908}- We'll share it.|- Oh, no, Charlie.
{30913}{30952}Not your birthday present.
{30973}{31053}It's my candy bar,|and I'll do what I want with it.
{31213}{31249}Thank you, darling.
{31272}{31310}Thank you, Charlie.
{31417}{31449}Bless you.
{32072}{32123}All right, let's see who found it.
{32233}{32312}"The third ticket was found|by Miss Violet Beauregarde. "
{32754}{32896}These are just some of the 263|trophies and medals my Violet has won.
{32900}{32982}I'm a gum chewer mostly, but when|I heard about these ticket things...
{32986}{33039}...I laid off the gum,|switched to candy bars.
{33049}{33120}She's just a driven young woman.|I don't know where she gets it.
{33182}{33233}I'm the Junior World Champion|Gum Chewer.
{33237}{33285}This piece of gum|I'm chewing right now...
{33289}{33383}...I've been working on for|three months solid. That's a record.
{33387}{33493}Of course, I did have my share|of trophies, mostly baton.
{33503}{33604}So it says that one kid's gonna get|this special prize, better than all the rest.
{33617}{33708}I don't care who those other four are.|That kid, it's gonna be me.
{33717}{33748}Tell them why, Violet.
{33758}{33790}{y:i}Because I'm a winner.
{33803}{33845}What a beastly girl.
{33849}{33900}Despicable.
{33904}{33957}You don't know|what we're talking about.
{34003}{34044}Dragonflies?
{34049}{34089}{y:i}But wait, this is just in.
{34093}{34224}{y:i}The fourth golden ticket has been found|{y:i}by a boy called Mike Teavee.
{34512}{34579}All you had to do was track|the manufacturing dates...
{34583}{34665}...offset by weather|and the derivative of the Nikkei Index.
{34676}{34720}A retard could figure it out.
{34749}{34812}Most of the time|I don't know what he's talking about.
{34817}{34887}You know, kids these days,|what with all the technology...
{34891}{34945}Die! Die! Die!
{34988}{35041}Doesn't seem like|they stay kids very long.
{35163}{35220}In the end,|I only had to buy one candy bar.
{35230}{35296}- And how did it taste?|- I don't know.
{35301}{35334}I hate chocolate.
{35338}{35433}Well, it's a good thing you're going to|a chocolate factory, you ungrateful little...
{35681}{35764}{y:i}That question is,|{y:i}who will be the winner of the last gold...?
{35918}{35957}- Dad?|- Yes, Charlie?
{35967}{36011}Why aren't you at work?
{36039}{36132}Oh, well, the toothpaste factory|thought they'd give me a bit of time off.
{36149}{36181}Like summer vacation?
{36198}{36254}Sure. Something like that.
{36336}{36430}{y:i}In fact, it wasn't like a vacation at all.
{36455}{36557}{y:i}The upswing in candy sales|{y:i}had led to a rise in cavities...
{36561}{36634}{y:i}... which led to a rise in toothpaste sales.
{36746}{36836}{y:i}With the extra money,|{y:i}the factory had decided to modernize...
{36851}{36936}{y:i}... eliminating Mr. Bucket's job.
{37062}{37124}We were barely making|ends meet as it was.
{37129}{37178}You'll find another job.
{37182}{37282}Until then, I'll just... Well, I'll just|thin down the soup a little more.
{37317}{37412}Don't worry, Mr. Bucket,|our luck will change.
{37421}{37460}I know it.
{37549}{37584}Charlie.
{37977}{38028}My secret hoard.
{38101}{38193}You and I are going to have|one more fling...
{38197}{38252}...at finding that last ticket.
{38271}{38324}You sure you want to spend|your money on that?
{38328}{38393}Of course I'm sure. Here.
{38429}{38483}Run down to the nearest store...
{38487}{38579}...and buy the first|Wonka candy bar you see.
{38583}{38668}Bring it straight back,|and we'll open it together.
{38869}{38934}Such a good boy, really.
{38964}{38992}Such a good...
{39054}{39088}Grandpa?
{39114}{39173}- You fell asleep.|- Have you got it?
{39305}{39352}Which end should we open first?
{39362}{39421}Just do it quick, like a Band-Aid.
{40149}{40221}Did you see that some kid in Russia|found the last golden ticket?
{40225}{40275}Yes, it was in the paper this morning.
{40279}{40363}Good boy. Come on, George. Good boy.
{41621}{41685}One Wonka Whipple-Scrumptious|Fudgemallow Delight, please.
{41689}{41749}Okay. Here you go.
{41885}{41926}The nerve of some people.
{41941}{42020}I know. Forging a ticket. Come on.
{42326}{42380}It's a golden ticket.
{42422}{42508}You found Wonka's last golden ticket.
{42522}{42572}In my shop too!
{42585}{42681}Listen. I'll buy it from you.|I'll give you $50 and a new bicycle.
{42685}{42760}Are you crazy?|I'd give him $500 for that ticket.
{42764}{42824}You wanna sell me your ticket|for $500, young man?
{42829}{42884}That's enough of that.|Leave the kid alone.
{42899}{43021}Listen. Don't let anyone have it.|Take it straight home, you understand?
{43057}{43088}Thank you.
{43264}{43316}Mom! Dad!
{43337}{43388}I found it!
{43393}{43453}The last golden ticket! It's mine!
{43992}{44020}Here.
{44041}{44116}Read it aloud.|Let's hear exactly what it says.
{44140}{44259}"Greetings to you, the lucky finder of|this golden ticket, from Mr. Willy Wonka.
{44271}{44370}I shake you warmly by the hand. For now,|I do invite you to come to my factory...
{44374}{44451}...and be my guest for one whole day. "
{44455}{44533}"I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you|around the factory myself...
{44537}{44586}...showing you everything|there is to see. "
{44590}{44637}"Afterwards, when it is time to leave...
{44641}{44722}...you will be escorted home|by a procession of large trucks...
{44726}{44805}...each one filled with all the chocolate|you could ever eat. "
{44809}{44922}"And remember, one of you lucky|five children will receive an extra prize...
{44926}{44979}...beyond your wildest imagination.
{44983}{45040}Now, here are your instructions. "
{45044}{45138}"On the 1st of February, you must come|to the factory gates at 10 a. m. Sharp.
{45142}{45223}You're allowed to bring one member|of your family to look after you.
{45227}{45281}Until then, Willy Wonka. "
{45297}{45329}The 1st of February.
{45355}{45424}- But that's tomorrow.|- Then there's not a moment to lose.
{45428}{45520}Wash your face, comb your hair, scrub your|hands, brush your teeth, blow your nose.
{45524}{45607}- And get that mud off your pants.|- Now we must all try and keep very calm.
{45621}{45725}First thing that we have to decide is this:|Who is going with Charlie to the factory?
{45732}{45807}I will. I'll take him. You leave it to me.
{45816}{45875}How about you, dear?|Don't you think you ought to go?
{45885}{45989}Well, Grandpa Joe seems to know|more about it than we do, and...
{46012}{46061}Provided, of course,|he feels well enough.
{46143}{46204}No. We're not going.
{46285}{46363}A woman offered me $500|for the ticket.
{46367}{46420}I bet someone else would pay more.
{46424}{46478}We need the money more|than we need the chocolate.
{46720}{46776}Young man, come here.
{46869}{46933}There's plenty of money out there.
{46937}{46988}They print more every day.
{47011}{47057}But this ticket...
{47061}{47155}...there's only five of them|in the whole world...
{47159}{47215}...and that's all there's ever going to be.
{47235}{47356}Only a dummy would give this up|for something as common as money.
{47370}{47423}Are you a dummy?
{47445}{47476}No, sir.
{47493}{47588}Then get that mud off your pants.|You've got a factory to go to.
{48645}{48700}Daddy, I want to go in.
{48705}{48741}It's 9:59, sweetheart.
{48745}{48806}Make time go faster.
{48816}{48863}Do you think Mr. Wonka|will recognize you?
{48867}{48962}Hard to say. It's been years.
{49140}{49181}Eyes on the prize, Violet.
{49185}{49240}Eyes on the prize.
{49664}{49726}{y:i}Please enter.
{50000}{50071}{y:i}Come forward.
{50165}{50243}{y:i}Close the gates.
{50440}{50489}{y:i}Dear visitors...
{50493}{50618}{y:i}... it is my great pleasure to welcome you|{y:i}to my humble factory.
{50674}{50722}{y:i}And who am I?
{50756}{50798}{y:i}Well...
{50886}{50930}{y:i}Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka
{50934}{50980}{y:i}The amazing chocolatier
{50985}{51032}{y:i}Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka
{51037}{51084}{y:i}Everybody give a cheer!|{y:i}Hooray!
{51088}{51133}{y:i}He's modest, clever and so smart
{51137}{51177}{y:i}He barely can restrain it
{51181}{51229}{y:i}With so much generosity
{51233}{51273}{y:i}There is no way to contain it!
{51277}{51358}{y:i}To contain it|{y:i}To contain, to contain, to contain!
{51369}{51406}{y:i}Hooray!
{51420}{51466}{y:i}Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka
{51470}{51512}{y:i}He's the one that you're about to meet
{51517}{51556}{y:i}Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka
{51560}{51615}{y:i}He's the genius who just can't be beat
{51619}{51661}{y:i}The magician and the chocolate wiz
{51666}{51706}{y:i}The best darn guy who ever lived
{51710}{51845}{y:i}Willy Wonka, here he is!
{52290}{52359}{y:i}The amazing chocolatier
{52605}{52652}Wasn't that just magnificent?
{52656}{52768}I was worried it was getting a little dodgy|in the middle part, but then that finale...
{52873}{52916}Who are you?
{52933}{53005}- He's Willy Wonka.|- Really?
{53245}{53296}"Good morning, starshine.
{53301}{53353}The Earth says hello. "
{53549}{53598}"Dear guests, greetings.
{53627}{53720}Welcome to the factory.|I shake you warmly by the hand.
{53806}{53875}My name is Willy Wonka. "
{53879}{53920}Then shouldn't you be up there?
{53942}{54028}I couldn't very well watch the show|from up there, now, could I, little girl?
{54032}{54124}Mr. Wonka, I don't know|if you'll remember me...
{54128}{54196}...but I used to work here in the factory.
{54209}{54281}Were you one of those despicable spies|who tried to steal...
{54285}{54378}...my life's work and sell it to parasitic,|copycat, candy-making cads?
{54385}{54414}No, sir.
{54430}{54467}Then wonderful. Welcome back.
{54472}{54505}Let's get a move on, kids.
{54579}{54636}Don't you want to know our names?
{54640}{54752}Can't imagine how it would matter.|Come quickly. Far too much to see.
{54889}{54933}Just drop your coats anywhere.
{55081}{55161}- Mr. Wonka? Sure is toasty in here.|- What?
{55176}{55288}I have to keep it warm in here. My workers|are used to an extremely hot climate.
{55292}{55344}They just can't stand the cold.
{55349}{55378}Who are the workers?
{55392}{55436}All in good time. Now...
{55545}{55589}Mr. Wonka, I'm Violet Beauregarde.
{55660}{55708}- I don't care.|- Well, you should care.
{55713}{55772}Because I'm gonna win|the special prize at the end.
{55776}{55846}Well, you do seem confident,|and confidence is key.
{55919}{55993}I'm Veruca Salt.|It's very nice to meet you, sir.
{56005}{56061}I always thought a verruca|was a type of wart...
{56065}{56127}...you got on the bottom of your foot.
{56161}{56232}I am Augustus Gloop.|I love your chocolate.
{56261}{56325}I can see that. So do I.
{56329}{56404}I never expected to have|so much in common.
{56501}{56568}You. You're Mike Teavee.
{56581}{56632}You're the little devil|who cracked the system.
{56686}{56757}And you. Well, you're just lucky|to be here, aren't you?
{56808}{56868}And the rest of you must be their...
{57048}{57106}- Parents.|- Yeah.
{57110}{57158}Moms and dads.
{57198}{57235}Dad?
{57282}{57328}Papa?
{57483}{57548}Okay, then. Let's move along.
{57955}{58007}- Would you like some chocolate?|- Sure.
{58011}{58062}Then you should've brought some.
{58150}{58207}- Let's be friends.|- Best friends.
{58504}{58545}An important room, this.
{58550}{58642}- After all, it is a chocolate factory.|- Then why is the door so small?
{58659}{58741}That's to keep all the great big|chocolaty flavor inside.
{59269}{59346}Now, do be careful, my dear children.
{59350}{59393}Don't lose your heads.
{59397}{59442}Don't get overexcited.
{59465}{59539}Just keep very calm.
{59917}{59946}It's beautiful.
{59970}{60011}What?
{60021}{60070}Oh, yeah, it's very beautiful.
{60306}{60362}Every drop of the river...
{60366}{60450}...is hot, melted chocolate|of the finest quality.
{60574}{60629}The waterfall is most important.
{60633}{60674}Mixes the chocolate.
{60678}{60750}Churns it up. Makes it light and frothy.
{60764}{60793}By the way...
{60798}{60936}...no other factory in the world mixes|its chocolate by waterfall, my dear children.
{60940}{60985}And you can take that to the bank.
{61234}{61272}People.
{61324}{61370}Those pipes...
{61382}{61493}...suck up the chocolate|and carry it away all over the factory.
{61510}{61574}Thousands of gallons an hour. Yeah.
{61608}{61677}And do you like my meadow?|Try some of my grass.
{61682}{61791}Please have a blade. Please do.|It's so delectable and so darn good-looking.
{61807}{61842}You can eat the grass?
{61846}{61896}Of course you can.
{61900}{61953}Everything in this room is eatable.
{61958}{61990}Even I'm eatable.
{61994}{62061}But that is called cannibalism,|my dear children...
{62066}{62133}...and is, in fact, frowned upon|in most societies.
{62140}{62169}Yeah.
{62194}{62232}Enjoy.
{62248}{62301}Go on. Scoot, scoot.
{62812}{62847}Son.
{62881}{62910}Please.
{62937}{63001}Dad, he said, "Enjoy. "
{63335}{63407}Why hold on to it?|Why not start a new piece?
{63426}{63533}Because then I wouldn't be a champion.|I'd be a loser, like you.
{64229}{64269}Daddy, look over there.
{64309}{64349}What is it?
{64354}{64391}It's a little person.
{64395}{64454}Over there, by the waterfall.
{64506}{64569}- There's two of them.|- There's more than two.
{64722}{64785}- Where do they come from?|- Who are they?
{64827}{64871}Are they real people?
{64875}{64933}Of course they're real people.|They're Oompa-Loompas.
{65023}{65094}- Oompa-Loompas?|- Imported, direct from Loompaland.
{65098}{65161}- There's no such place.|- What?
{65165}{65248}Mr. Wonka, I teach high-school geography,|and I'm here to tell you...
{65253}{65377}Well, then you'll know all about it,|and, oh, what a terrible country it is.
{65641}{65697}{y:i}The whole place is nothing|{y:i}but thick jungles...
{65701}{65787}{y:i}... infested by the most dangerous beasts|{y:i}in the entire world.
{65807}{65914}{y:i}Hornswogglers and snozzwangers|{y:i}and those terrible, wicked whangdoodles.
{66421}{66515}{y:i}I went to Loompaland looking for|{y:i}exotic new flavors for candy.
{66613}{66644}{y:i}Instead...
{66648}{66696}{y:i}... I found the Oompa-Loompas.
{66892}{67011}{y:i}They lived in tree houses to escape|{y:i}from the fierce creatures who lived below.
{67096}{67197}{y:i}The Oompa-Loompas ate nothing but|{y:i}green caterpillars, which tasted revolting.
{67230}{67278}{y:i}The Oompa-Loompas looked|{y:i}for other things...
{67282}{67350}{y:i}... to mash up with the caterpillars|{y:i}to make them taste better:
{67354}{67437}{y:i}Red beetles,|{y:i}the bark of the bong-bong tree.
{67441}{67471}{y:i}All of them beastly...
{67484}{67547}{y:i}... but not quite so beastly|{y:i}as the caterpillars.
{68321}{68426}{y:i}But the food they longed for the most|{y:i}was the cocoa bean.
{68511}{68600}{y:i}An Oompa-Loompa was lucky if he found|{y:i}three or four cocoa beans a year.
{68604}{68661}{y:i}But, oh, how they craved them.
{68691}{68765}{y:i}All they'd ever think about|{y:i}was cocoa beans.
{68895}{68998}The cocoa bean is the thing from which|chocolate is made, so I told the chief:
{69493}{69558}They are such wonderful workers.
{69562}{69633}I feel I must warn you, though,|they are rather mischievous.
{69637}{69683}Always making jokes.
{69690}{69773}Augustus, my child,|that is not a good thing you do!
{69834}{69869}Hey, little boy.
{69873}{69947}My chocolate must be untouched|by human hands.
{70114}{70149}He'll drown.
{70184}{70220}He can't swim.
{70225}{70262}Save him!
{70291}{70358}Augustus! No!
{70509}{70559}Augustus!
{70775}{70846}Augustus, watch out!
{71241}{71280}There he goes.
{71317}{71357}Call the fire brigade!
{71361}{71417}It's a wonder how|that pipe is big enough.
{71437}{71490}It isn't big enough. He's slowing down.
{71494}{71525}He's gonna stick.
{71563}{71594}I think he has.
{71679}{71715}He's blocked the whole pipe.
{71788}{71835}Look. The Oompa-Loompas.
{72032}{72070}What are they doing?
{72127}{72222}They're going to treat us to a little song.|It is quite a special occasion.
{72226}{72280}They haven't had a fresh audience|in many a moon.
{72758}{72818}{y:i}Augustus Gloop, Augustus Gloop
{72832}{72888}{y:i}The great big, greedy nincompoop
{72892}{73009}{y:i}Augustus Gloop, so big and vile|{y:i}So greedy, foul and infantile
{73013}{73068}{y:i}"Come on!" we cried|{y:i}"The time is ripe
{73072}{73134}{y:i}To send him shooting up the pipe!"
{73138}{73193}{y:i}But don't, dear children, be alarmed
{73200}{73259}{y:i}Augustus Gloop will not be harmed
{73264}{73318}{y:i}Augustus Gloop will not be harmed
{74072}{74120}{y:i}Although, of course, we must admit
{74124}{74178}{y:i}He will be altered quite a bit
{74192}{74253}{y:i}Slowly, wheels go round and round
{74257}{74312}{y:i}And cogs begin to grind and pound
{74316}{74382}{y:i}This greedy brute, this louse's ear
{74440}{74493}{y:i}Is loved by people everywhere
{74497}{74564}{y:i}For who could hate or bear a grudge
{74568}{74714}{y:i}Against a luscious bit of fudge?
{75653}{75699}Bravo! Well done!
{75703}{75757}Aren't they delightful?|Aren't they charming?
{75761}{75869}- I do say, that all seemed rather rehearsed.|- Like they knew it was gonna happen.
{75886}{75928}Oh, poppycock.
{76005}{76067}Where is my son?|Where does that pipe go to?
{76108}{76163}That pipe, it just so happens to lead...
{76167}{76221}...directly to the room|where I make delicious...
{76225}{76285}...strawberry-flavored,|chocolate-coated fudge.
{76289}{76374}Then he will be made into|strawberry-flavored, chocolate-coated fudge.
{76378}{76462}They'll be selling him by the pound|all over the world?
{76467}{76536}No. I wouldn't allow it.|The taste would be terrible.
{76550}{76627}Can you imagine Augustus-flavored,|chocolate-coated Gloop?
{76648}{76676}No one would buy it.
{76888}{76967}I want you to take Mrs. Gloop|up to the Fudge Room, okay?
{76971}{77006}Help her find her son.
{77011}{77145}Take a long stick and start poking around|in the big chocolate-mixing barrel, okay?
{77547}{77585}Mr. Wonka?
{77593}{77678}Why would Augustus' name already|be in the Oompa-Loompa song, unless...?
{77682}{77767}Improvisation is a parlor trick.|Anyone can do it.
{77783}{77824}You, little girl. Say something.
{77828}{77876}- Anything.|- Chewing gum.
{77890}{77954}{y:i}Chewing gum is really gross|{y:i}Chewing gum, I hate the most
{77958}{78006}See? Exactly the same.
{78011}{78045}No, it isn't.
{78070}{78111}You really shouldn't mumble.
{78115}{78168}Because I can't understand|a word you're saying.
{78221}{78288}Now, on with the tour.
{78354}{78448}- Are the Oompa-Loompas really joking?|- Of course they're joking.
{78452}{78511}That boy will be fine.
{79686}{79715}What's so funny?
{79734}{79799}I think it's from all those|doggone cocoa beans.
{79803}{79897}Hey, by the way, did you guys know|that chocolate contains a property...
{79901}{80016}...that triggers the release of endorphins?|Gives one the feeling of being in love.
{80025}{80061}You don't say.
{80130}{80175}All aboard.
{80427}{80457}Onward!
{81031}{81069}Here.
{81073}{81182}Try some of this. It'll do you good.|You look starved to death.
{81218}{81325}- It's great.|- That's because it's mixed by waterfall.
{81329}{81365}The waterfall is most important.
{81369}{81471}Mixes the chocolate, churns it up,|makes it light and frothy.
{81475}{81582}- By the way, no other factory in the world...|- You already said that.
{81715}{81803}- You're all quite short, aren't you?|- Well, yeah. We're children.
{81807}{81870}Well, that's no excuse.|I was never as short as you.
{81875}{81954}- You were once.|- Was not. Know why?
{81958}{82047}Because I distinctly remember|putting a hat on top of my head.
{82051}{82143}Look at your short, little arms.|You could never reach.
{82203}{82257}Do you even remember|what it was like being a kid?
{82261}{82311}Oh, boy, do I.
{82398}{82428}Do I?
{82432}{82550}{y:i}In fact, Willy Wonka hadn't thought|{y:i}about his childhood for years.
{82554}{82612}Trick or treat!
{82620}{82658}Trick or treat!
{82851}{82889}Trick or treat!
{82947}{82982}Who do we have here?
{82986}{83074}Ruthie, Veronica, Terrance.
{83078}{83115}And who's that under the sheet?
{83168}{83241}Little Willy Wonka.
{83309}{83417}{y:i}Willy Wonka was the son|{y:i}of the city's most famous dentist...
{83421}{83467}{y:i}... Wilbur Wonka.
{83633}{83673}Now...
{83677}{83745}...let's see what the damage is|this year, shall we?
{84083}{84127}Caramels.
{84140}{84219}They'd get stuck in your braces,|wouldn't they?
{84326}{84382}Lollipops.
{84386}{84476}Ought to be called "cavities on a stick. "
{84494}{84539}Then we have all this...
{84543}{84576}All this...
{84587}{84625}...chocolate.
{84672}{84768}You know, just last week, I was reading|in a very important medical journal...
{84772}{84885}...that some children|are allergic to chocolate.
{84889}{84953}Makes their noses itch.
{84962}{85016}Maybe I'm not allergic.
{85020}{85057}I could try a piece.
{85062}{85102}Really?
{85106}{85155}But why take a chance?
{85527}{85595}Mr. Wonka? Mr. Wonka?
{85599}{85655}- We're headed for a tunnel.|- Oh, yeah.
{85664}{85693}Full speed ahead.
{85856}{85926}- How can they see where they're going?|- They can't.
{85936}{85985}There's no knowing where they're going.
{85994}{86024}Switch on the lights!
{86686}{86725}People, keep an eye out.
{86729}{86778}We're passing some|very important rooms here.
{86913}{86949}What do you use hair cream for?
{86978}{87016}To lock in moisture.
{87190}{87249}- Whipped cream.|- Precisely.
{87267}{87295}That doesn't make sense.
{87324}{87364}For your information, little girl...
{87368}{87460}...whipped cream isn't whipped cream at all|unless it's been whipped with whips.
{87464}{87515}Everybody knows that.
{88704}{88775}Stop the boat.|I wanna show you guys something.
{89273}{89351}Now, this is the most important room|in the entire factory.
{89362}{89462}Now, everyone, enjoy yourselves,|but just don't touch anything.
{89466}{89496}Okay? Go on.
{89500}{89532}Go on, scoot.
{89808}{89853}Hey, Mr. Wonka, what's this?
{89910}{89953}Let me show you.
{89996}{90026}Thank you.
{90030}{90083}These are Everlasting Gobstoppers.
{90087}{90151}They're for children who are given|very little allowance.
{90155}{90238}You can suck on it all year,|and it'll never get any smaller.
{90245}{90300}- Isn't that neat?|- It's like gum.
{90314}{90376}No. Gum is for chewing.
{90380}{90433}If you tried chewing|one of these Gobstoppers...
{90438}{90486}...you'd break all your little teeth off.
{90490}{90546}But they sure do taste terrific.
{90719}{90778}And this is Hair Toffee.
{90782}{90838}You suck down one of|these little boogers...
{90842}{90889}...and in exactly half an hour...
{90893}{90982}...a brand-new crop of hair will grow out|over the top of your little noggin.
{90986}{91039}And a mustache. And a beard.
{91043}{91104}- Who wants a beard?|- Well...
{91108}{91184}...beatniks, for one.|Folk singers and motorbike riders.
{91188}{91289}You know, all those hip, jazzy, super-cool,|neat, keen and groovy cats.
{91293}{91351}It's in the fridge, daddy-o.|Are you hep to the jive?
{91355}{91405}Can you dig what I'm laying down?|I knew you could.
{91410}{91473}Slide me some skin, soul brother.
{91550}{91597}Unfortunately, the mixture isn't right yet.
{91602}{91680}Because an Oompa-Loompa|tried some yesterday, and, well, he...
{91797}{91824}How are you today?
{91867}{91900}You look great.
{92110}{92145}Watch this.
{92827}{92857}You mean that's it?
{92870}{92915}Do you even know what "it" is?
{92924}{92972}- It's gum.|- Yeah.
{92976}{93072}It's a stick of the most amazing|and sensational gum in the whole universe.
{93076}{93128}Know why? Know why?
{93132}{93228}Because this gum is a full|three-course dinner all by itself.
{93290}{93324}Why would anyone want that?
{93504}{93562}"It will be the end of all kitchens|and all cooking.
{93566}{93654}Just a little strip of Wonka's magic|chewing gum and that is all you will...
{93658}{93709}...ever need at breakfast,|lunch and dinner.
{93714}{93819}This piece of gum happens to be|tomato soup, roast beef and blueberry pie. "
{93823}{93870}It sounds great.
{93881}{93957}- It sounds weird.|- It sounds like my kind of gum.
{94026}{94093}I'd rather you didn't.|There are still some things that are...
{94097}{94180}I'm the world-record holder in chewing gum.|I'm not afraid of anything.
{94315}{94389}- How is it, honey?|- It's amazing!
{94394}{94457}Tomato soup.|I can feel it running down my throat.
{94461}{94495}Yeah. Spit it out.
{94499}{94561}- Young lady, I think you'd better...|- It's changing.
{94578}{94633}Roast beef, with baked potato.
{94641}{94680}Crispy skin and butter.
{94685}{94788}Keep chewing. My little girl's gonna be the|first person to have a chewing-gum meal.
{94792}{94851}Yeah. I'm just a little concerned|about the...
{94855}{94895}Blueberry pie and ice cream!
{94910}{94969}- That part.|- What's happening to her nose?
{95104}{95137}It's turning blue.
{95206}{95247}Your whole nose has gone purple.
{95260}{95308}What do you mean?
{95325}{95389}Violet, you're turning violet.
{95414}{95500}- What's happening?|- Well, I told you I hadn't quite got it right.
{95504}{95577}Because it goes a little funny|when it gets to the dessert.
{95582}{95622}It's the blueberry pie that does it.
{95642}{95693}I'm terribly sorry.
{95901}{95980}Mother? What's happening to me?
{96286}{96320}She's swelling up.
{96419}{96449}Like a blueberry.
{97138}{97235}I've tried it on, like, 20 Oompa-Loompas,|and each one ended up as a blueberry.
{97239}{97282}It's just weird.
{97286}{97334}But I can't have a blueberry|as a daughter.
{97338}{97376}How is she supposed to compete?
{97380}{97420}You could put her in a county fair.
{97758}{97804}{y:i}Yeah, yeah
{97917}{97951}{y:i}Yeah
{97955}{98007}{y:i}Listen close, and listen hard
{98011}{98056}{y:i}To the tale of Violet Beauregarde
{98060}{98121}{y:i}This gentle girl|{y:i}She sees no wrong
{98126}{98183}{y:i}In chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing
{98187}{98241}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{98245}{98292}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{98296}{98357}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{98362}{98412}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{98448}{98480}{y:i}Yeah
{98642}{98697}{y:i}She goes on chewing till, at last
{98702}{98753}{y:i}Her chewing muscles grow so vast
{98757}{98812}{y:i}And from her face|{y:i}Her giant chin
{98816}{98872}{y:i}Sticks out just like a violin
{98876}{98928}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{98932}{98984}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{98988}{99044}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{99152}{99208}{y:i}For years and years she chews away
{99212}{99269}{y:i}Her jaws get stronger every day
{99273}{99325}{y:i}And with one great, tremendous chew
{99329}{99381}{y:i}They bite the poor girl's tongue in two
{99388}{99437}{y:i}And that is why we try so hard
{99448}{99503}{y:i}To save Miss Violet Beauregarde
{99507}{99561}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{99565}{99617}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{99622}{99677}{y:i}Chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing
{99681}{99740}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{99745}{99792}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{99797}{99851}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{99855}{99887}{y:i}Chewing, chewing all day long
{99937}{99990}Mr. Wonka!
{100119}{100178}I want you to roll Miss Beauregarde|into the boat...
{100182}{100272}...and take her along to|the Juicing Room at once, okay?
{100287}{100346}Juicing Room?|What are they gonna do to her there?
{100361}{100402}They're gonna squeeze her.
{100406}{100453}Like a little pimple.
{100475}{100546}We gotta squeeze all that juice|out of her immediately.
{100625}{100663}Mother, help me.
{100667}{100707}Please.
{100829}{100869}Come on.
{100881}{100913}Let's boogie.
{100921}{100998}Without the boat, we'll have to move|double-time to keep on schedule.
{101002}{101033}There's far too much to see.
{101037}{101063}- Mr. Wonka?|- Yeah?
{101069}{101110}Why did you decide to let people in?
{101117}{101162}So they could see the factory,|of course.
{101168}{101225}But why now? And why only five?
{101229}{101284}What's the special prize, and who gets it?
{101288}{101363}The best kind of prize is a surprise.
{101372}{101417}Will Violet always be a blueberry?
{101421}{101471}No. Maybe. I don't know.
{101481}{101550}That's what you get from chewing gum|all day. It's disgusting.
{101556}{101613}If you hate gum so much,|why do you make it?
{101617}{101687}Once again, you shouldn't mumble.|It's starting to bum me out.
{101691}{101760}Can you remember the first candy|you ever ate?
{101847}{101876}No.
{101880}{102028}{y:i}In fact, Willy Wonka did remember|{y:i}the first candy he ever ate.
{103467}{103545}I'm sorry, I was having a flashback.
{103560}{103603}I see.
{103611}{103657}These flashbacks happen often?
{103661}{103708}Increasingly...
{103716}{103755}...today.
{103933}{103976}This is a room I know all about.
{103980}{104055}For you see, Mr. Wonka,|I, myself, am in the nut business.
{104060}{104141}Are you using the Havermax 4000|to do your sorting?
{104145}{104184}No.
{104188}{104222}You're really weird.
{104735}{104800}- Squirrels.|- Yeah. Squirrels.
{104804}{104881}These squirrels are specially trained|to get the nuts out of shells.
{105275}{105334}Why use squirrels?|Why not use Oompa-Loompas?
{105339}{105446}Because only squirrels can get the whole|walnut out almost every single time.
{105462}{105538}See how they tap them with their knuckles|to make sure it's not bad?
{105548}{105578}Oh, look. Look.
{105621}{105659}I think that one's got a bad nut.
{105716}{105757}Daddy, I want a squirrel.
{105761}{105815}Get me one of those squirrels.|I want one.
{105825}{105891}Veruca, dear,|you have many marvelous pets.
{105895}{105990}All I've got at home is one pony and two|dogs and four cats and six bunny rabbits...
{105994}{106075}...and two parakeets and three canaries|and a green parrot and a turtle...
{106080}{106154}...and a silly old hamster.|I want a squirrel!
{106168}{106197}All right, pet.
{106201}{106263}Daddy will get you a squirrel|as soon as he possibly can.
{106268}{106353}But I don't want any old squirrel,|I want a trained squirrel.
{106385}{106423}Very well.
{106430}{106507}Mr. Wonka, how much do you want|for one of these squirrels?
{106512}{106559}Name your price.
{106580}{106642}Oh, they're not for sale.|She can't have one.
{106762}{106800}Daddy.
{106840}{106870}I'm sorry, darling.
{106881}{106933}Mr. Wonka's being unreasonable.
{106996}{107081}If you won't get me a squirrel,|I'll get one myself.
{107294}{107328}Veruca.
{107368}{107400}Little girl?
{107492}{107535}Veruca, come back here at once.
{107598}{107637}Veruca.
{107922}{107956}Little girl?
{107968}{108011}Don't touch that squirrel's nuts.
{108015}{108065}It'll make him crazy.
{108456}{108492}I'll have you.
{108617}{108652}Veruca.
{108803}{108835}Veruca.
{108888}{108924}No!
{109029}{109062}Veruca!
{109118}{109170}Let's find the key.
{109205}{109237}Nope. Not that one.
{109264}{109317}- Daddy!|- Veruca!
{109341}{109394}No. It's not that one.
{109672}{109714}There it is.
{109718}{109747}There it isn't.
{109752}{109793}Daddy, I want them to stop.
{110051}{110085}What are they doing?
{110089}{110137}They're testing to see if she's a bad nut.
{110188}{110255}Oh, my goodness.|She is a bad nut after all.
{110427}{110458}Veruca!
{110472}{110505}Daddy!
{110509}{110546}Where are they taking her?
{110550}{110617}Where all the other bad nuts go.|To the garbage chute.
{110640}{110674}Where does the chute go?
{110678}{110707}To the incinerator.
{110726}{110783}But don't worry.|We only light it on Tuesdays.
{110788}{110826}Today is Tuesday.
{110878}{110951}Well, there's always the chance|they decided not to light it today.
{111392}{111463}Now, she may be stuck in the chute|just below the top.
{111467}{111553}If that's the case, all you have to do|is just reach in and pull her out.
{111574}{111603}Okay?
{112515}{112591}{y:i}Veruca Salt, the little brute
{112595}{112669}{y:i}Has just gone down the garbage chute
{112673}{112771}{y:i}And she will meet, as she descends
{112776}{112853}{y:i}A rather different set of friends
{112857}{112928}{y:i}A rather different set of friends
{112932}{113019}{y:i}A rather different set of friends
{113024}{113098}{y:i}A fish head, for example, cut
{113102}{113176}{y:i}This morning from a halibut
{113180}{113259}{y:i}An oyster from an oyster stew
{113263}{113352}{y:i}A steak that no one else would chew
{113356}{113436}{y:i}And lots of other things as well
{113440}{113587}{y:i}Each with its rather horrid smell
{113592}{113681}{y:i}Horrid smell
{113689}{113766}{y:i}These are Veruca's newfound friends
{113770}{113855}{y:i}That she will meet as she descends
{113860}{113985}{y:i}These are Veruca's newfound friends
{114444}{114528}{y:i}Who went and spoiled her, who indeed?
{114532}{114615}{y:i}Who pandered to her every need?
{114619}{114695}{y:i}Who turned her into such a brat?
{114700}{114743}{y:i}Who are the culprits?
{114747}{114782}{y:i}Who did that?
{114787}{114865}{y:i}The guilty ones, now this is sad
{114869}{114958}{y:i}Are dear old Mum and loving Dad
{115212}{115267}Oh, really? Oh, good.
{115274}{115333}I've just been informed|that the incinerator's broken.
{115337}{115422}So there should be about three weeks|of rotten garbage to break their fall.
{115426}{115462}Well, that's good news.
{115469}{115505}Yeah.
{115517}{115586}Well, let's keep on trucking.
{115648}{115694}I don't know why I didn't think of this.
{115698}{115781}The elevator's by far the most efficient way|to get around the factory.
{115785}{115829}There can't be this many floors.
{115850}{115901}How do you know, Mr. Smarty-Pants?
{115905}{115972}This isn't just an ordinary|up-and-down elevator, by the way.
{115976}{116036}This elevator can go sideways,|longways, slantways...
{116040}{116078}...and any other ways|you can think of.
{116082}{116151}You just press any button|and, whoosh, you're off.
{116396}{116426}Oh, look. Look.
{116457}{116531}Ladies and gentlemen,|welcome to Fudge Mountain.
{117228}{117271}I'd rather not talk about this one.
{117542}{117595}This is the Puppet Hospital|and Burn Center.
{117704}{117771}It's relatively new.
{117931}{117966}The administration offices.
{118019}{118052}Hello, Doris.
{118900}{118966}Why is everything here|completely pointless?
{118970}{119018}Candy doesn't have to have a point.
{119022}{119055}That's why it's candy.
{119059}{119094}It's stupid.
{119108}{119184}Candy is a waste of time.
{119200}{119277}No son of mine is going to be|a chocolatier.
{119290}{119327}Then I'll run away.
{119332}{119383}To Switzerland. Bavaria.
{119388}{119434}The candy capitals of the world.
{119452}{119483}Go ahead.
{119488}{119531}But I won't be here|when you come back.
{120216}{120247}Sorry, son.
{120252}{120311}We're closing for the night.
{120921}{120961}I wanna pick a room.
{121034}{121069}Go ahead.
{121521}{121552}Here.
{121564}{121633}Put these on quick, and don't|take them off whatever you do.
{121649}{121720}This light could burn your eyeballs|right out of your skulls.
{121728}{121798}And we certainly don't want that,|now, do we?
{121867}{121955}This is the testing room for my very latest|and greatest invention:
{121965}{122024}Television Chocolate.
{122028}{122058}One day it occurred to me:
{122062}{122127}"Hey, if television can break up|a photograph...
{122132}{122225}...into millions and millions of tiny pieces|and send it whizzing through the air...
{122229}{122274}...then reassemble it|on the other end...
{122278}{122327}...why can't I do the same|with chocolate?
{122338}{122467}Why can't I send a real bar of chocolate|through the television, ready to be eaten?"
{122472}{122561}{y:i}I'm not gonna touch it.|{y:i}I'm not going in that direction.
{122596}{122625}Sounds impossible.
{122636}{122668}It is impossible.
{122692}{122755}You don't understand anything|about science.
{122760}{122866}First off, there's a difference between|waves and particles.
{122885}{122971}Second, the amount of power it would take|to convert energy in matter...
{122980}{123019}...would be like nine atomic bombs.
{123024}{123059}Mumbler!
{123079}{123174}Seriously, I cannot understand|a single word you're saying.
{123260}{123295}Okey-dokey.
{123300}{123379}I shall now send a bar of chocolate|from one end of the room...
{123384}{123457}...to the other by television.
{123461}{123494}Bring in the chocolate.
{123993}{124057}It's gotta be real big|because you know how on TV...
{124061}{124142}...you can film a regular-size man,|and he comes out looking this tall?
{124146}{124180}Same basic principle.
{124947}{124985}It's gone.
{125011}{125107}Told you. That bar of chocolate is now|rushing through the air above our heads...
{125112}{125170}...in a million tiny little pieces.
{125174}{125243}Come over here.|Come on. Come on. Come on!
{125377}{125419}Watch the screen.
{125500}{125539}Here it comes.
{125565}{125603}Oh, look.
{125701}{125767}- Take it.|- It's just a picture on a screen.
{125789}{125819}Scaredy-cat.
{125824}{125859}You take it.
{125880}{125934}Go on. Just reach out and grab it.
{126131}{126166}Go on.
{126358}{126402}Holy buckets.
{126475}{126525}Eat it. Go on.
{126529}{126581}It'll be delicious. It's the same bar.
{126585}{126664}It's just gotten a little smaller|on the journey, that's all.
{126864}{126900}It's great.
{126904}{126941}It's a miracle.
{126980}{127052}So imagine, you're sitting at home|watching television...
{127056}{127143}...and suddenly a commercial will flash|onto the screen, and a voice will say:
{127147}{127244}"Wonka's chocolates|are the best in the world.
{127248}{127318}If you don't believe us,|try one for yourself. "
{127343}{127428}And you simply reach out and take it.
{127450}{127481}How about that?
{127485}{127532}So can you send other things?
{127536}{127579}Say, like, breakfast cereal?
{127587}{127652}Do you have any idea|what breakfast cereal's made of?
{127656}{127735}It's those little curly wooden shavings|you find in pencil sharpeners.
{127739}{127787}But could you send it by TV|if you wanted to?
{127796}{127843}- Of course I could.|- What about people?
{127855}{127935}Well, why would I wanna send a person?|They don't taste very good at all.
{127940}{128017}Don't you realize what you've invented?|It's a teleporter.
{128024}{128093}It's the most important invention|in the history of the world.
{128097}{128149}And all you think about is chocolate.
{128153}{128183}Calm down, Mike.
{128187}{128253}I think Mr. Wonka knows|what he's talking about.
{128257}{128315}No, he doesn't. He has no idea.
{128320}{128370}You think he's a genius,|but he's an idiot.
{128392}{128435}But I'm not.
{128548}{128582}Hey, little boy.
{128615}{128655}Don't push my button.
{129648}{129682}He's gone.
{129692}{129753}Let's go check the television,|see what we get.
{129781}{129839}I sure hope no part of him|gets left behind.
{129843}{129872}What do you mean?
{129884}{129989}Well, sometimes only half|of the little pieces find their way through.
{130017}{130100}If you had to choose only one half|of your son, which one would it be?
{130108}{130153}What kind of a question is that?
{130172}{130246}No need to snap. Just a question.
{130266}{130337}Try every channel.|I'm starting to feel a little anxious.
{130472}{130514}- There he is.|- Mike.
{130532}{130572}{y:i}The most important thing
{130576}{130606}{y:i}That we've ever learned
{130610}{130691}{y:i}The most important thing we've learned|{y:i}As far as children are concerned
{130696}{130763}{y:i}Is never, never let them near|{y:i}The television set
{130768}{130851}{y:i}Or better still just don't install|{y:i}The idiotic thing at all
{130875}{130939}{y:i}Never, never let them|{y:i}Never, never let them
{131253}{131291}{y:i}Never, never let them
{131296}{131326}{y:i}Never, never let them
{131330}{131373}{y:i}It rots the senses in the head
{131377}{131406}{y:i}It keeps imagination dead
{131410}{131446}{y:i}It clogs and clutters up the mind
{131451}{131489}{y:i}It makes a child so dull and blind
{131493}{131526}{y:i}So dull, so dull
{131530}{131602}{y:i}He can no longer understand|{y:i}A fairy tale, a fairyland
{131607}{131644}{y:i}A fairyland, a fairyland
{131649}{131683}{y:i}His brain becomes as soft as cheese
{131687}{131722}{y:i}His thinking powers rust and freeze
{131727}{131804}{y:i}He cannot think, he only sees
{131920}{131990}{y:i}Regarding little Mike Teavee
{131994}{132057}{y:i}We very much regret that we
{132071}{132109}{y:i}Regret that we
{132149}{132187}{y:i}Shall simply have to wait and see
{132192}{132223}{y:i}Wait and see, wait and see
{132227}{132282}{y:i}Wait and see, wait and see, wait and see
{132286}{132319}{y:i}We very much regret that we
{132323}{132362}{y:i}Shall simply have to wait and see
{132366}{132411}{y:i}If we can get him back his height
{132415}{132476}{y:i}But if we can't
{132480}{132505}{y:i}It serves him right
{132517}{132547}Somebody grab him.
{132551}{132595}{y:i}Help me.
{132612}{132649}{y:i}Help me.
{132672}{132746}Oh, thank heavens.|He's completely unharmed.
{132750}{132835}Unharmed? What are you talking about?
{132904}{132961}Just put me back in the other way.
{132965}{133002}There is no other way.
{133007}{133079}It's television, not telephone.|There's quite a difference.
{133084}{133156}And what exactly do you propose|to do about it?
{133160}{133187}I don't know.
{133209}{133297}But young men are extremely springy.|They stretch like mad.
{133312}{133386}- Let's go put him in the taffy puller.|- Taffy puller?
{133403}{133434}Hey, that was my idea.
{133485}{133518}Boy, is he gonna be skinny.
{133544}{133581}Yeah.
{133585}{133639}Taffy puller.
{133661}{133722}I want you to take Mr. Teavee|and his...
{133755}{133818}...little boy up to the taffy puller, okay?
{133822}{133865}Stretch him out.
{134124}{134171}On with the tour.
{134383}{134439}There's still so much left to see.
{134443}{134503}Now, how many children are left?
{134568}{134674}Mr. Wonka,|Charlie's the only one left now.
{134730}{134763}You mean, you're the only one?
{134785}{134825}Yes.
{134832}{134863}What happened to the others?
{134972}{135034}Oh, my dear boy,|but that means you've won.
{135038}{135090}Oh, I do congratulate you. I really do.
{135094}{135126}I'm absolutely delighted.
{135130}{135191}I had a hunch right from the beginning.|Well done.
{135196}{135243}Now, we mustn't dilly or dally.
{135248}{135318}We have an enormous number|of things to do before the day's out.
{135322}{135419}But luckily for us, we have the great|glass elevator to speed things along...
{135574}{135605}Speed things along.
{135673}{135711}Come on.
{135860}{135915}"Up and Out"? What kind of room is that?
{135928}{135968}Hold on.
{136178}{136220}Oh, my goodness.
{136224}{136310}We're gonna need to go much faster,|otherwise we'll just never break through.
{136314}{136351}Break through what?
{136357}{136415}I've been longing to press|that button for years.
{136433}{136499}Well, here we go. Up and out.
{136508}{136565}- But do you really mean...?|- Yeah. I do.
{136569}{136605}But it's made of glass.
{136609}{136657}It'll smash into a million pieces.
{137510}{137581}Augustus, please don't eat your fingers.
{137585}{137630}But I taste so good.
{137947}{138005}Look, Mother.|I'm much more flexible now.
{138018}{138078}Yes, but you're blue.
{138617}{138683}Daddy, I want a flying glass elevator.
{138700}{138779}Veruca, the only thing you're getting today|is a bath, and that's final.
{138784}{138823}But I want it.
{139231}{139275}Where do you live?
{139296}{139347}Right over there. That little house.
{139476}{139519}What time do you think they'll be back?
{139523}{139562}Hard to know, dear.
{139842}{139905}I think there's someone at the door.
{139909}{139952}Hi, Mom.
{140013}{140067}Mom. Dad. We're back.
{140072}{140111}- Charlie.|- Charlie.
{140144}{140182}Goodness.
{140227}{140291}This is Willy Wonka.|He gave us a ride home.
{140303}{140336}I see that.
{140340}{140388}You must be the boy's...
{140420}{140480}- Parents?|- Yeah. That.
{140484}{140555}He says Charlie's won something.
{140589}{140622}Not just some something.
{140630}{140725}The most "something" something|of any something that's ever been.
{140737}{140805}I'm gonna give this little boy|my entire factory.
{140856}{140906}You must be joking.
{140910}{140941}No, really. It's true.
{140945}{141027}Because you see, a few months ago,|I was having my semiannual haircut...
{141031}{141111}...and I had the strangest revelation.
{141443}{141487}{y:i}In that one silver hair...
{141491}{141551}{y:i}... I saw reflected my life's work...
{141556}{141637}{y:i}... my factory,|{y:i}my beloved Oompa-Loompas.
{141641}{141711}{y:i}Who would watch over them|{y:i}after I was gone?
{141716}{141758}{y:i}I realized in that moment:
{141762}{141822}I must find a heir.
{141860}{141911}And I did, Charlie.
{141915}{141947}You.
{142000}{142050}That's why you sent out|the golden tickets.
{142095}{142140}What are Oompa-Loompas?
{142144}{142193}I invited five children to the factory...
{142197}{142263}...and the one who was the least rotten|would be the winner.
{142272}{142306}That's you, Charlie.
{142317}{142354}So, what do you say?
{142359}{142444}Are you ready to leave all this behind|and come live with me at the factory?
{142448}{142479}Sure. Of course.
{142483}{142547}I mean, it's all right|if my family come too?
{142551}{142605}Oh, my dear boy, of course they can't.
{142627}{142667}You can't run a chocolate factory...
{142671}{142751}...with a family hanging over you|like an old, dead goose. No offense.
{142756}{142799}None taken, jerk.
{142848}{142908}A chocolatier has to run free and solo.
{142912}{142983}He has to follow his dreams.|Gosh darn the consequences.
{143020}{143049}Look at me.
{143053}{143114}I had no family, and I'm a giant success.
{143147}{143242}So if I go with you to the factory,|I won't ever see my family again?
{143247}{143303}Yeah. Consider that a bonus.
{143366}{143395}Then I'm not going.
{143422}{143475}I wouldn't give up my family|for anything.
{143496}{143541}Not for all the chocolate in the world.
{143602}{143653}Oh, I see.
{143699}{143744}That's weird.
{143820}{143883}There's other candy too|besides chocolate.
{143908}{143975}I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka. I'm staying here.
{144140}{144183}Well, that's just...
{144201}{144248}...unexpected...
{144286}{144325}...and weird.
{144495}{144559}But I suppose, in that case, I'll just...
{144617}{144648}Goodbye, then.
{144723}{144759}Sure you won't change your mind?
{144822}{144859}I'm sure.
{145082}{145131}Okay. Bye.
{145651}{145722}Things are going to get much better.
{145738}{145874}{y:i}And for once, Grandma Georgina knew|{y:i}exactly what she was talking about.
{145893}{145998}{y:i}The next morning, Charlie helped|{y:i}his parents fix the hole in the roof.
{146033}{146106}{y:i}Grandpa Joe spent the whole day|{y:i}out of bed.
{146111}{146155}{y:i}He didn't feel tired at all.
{146200}{146283}{y:i}Charlie's father got a better job|{y:i}at the toothpaste factory...
{146288}{146372}{y:i}... repairing the machine|{y:i}that had replaced him.
{146416}{146495}{y:i}Things had never been better|{y:i}for the Bucket family.
{146504}{146589}{y:i}The same could not be said|{y:i}for Willy Wonka.
{146593}{146646}I can't put my finger on it.
{146657}{146711}Candy's the only thing|I was ever certain of...
{146716}{146774}...and now I'm just not|certain at all.
{146778}{146845}I don't know which flavors to make|or which ideas to try.
{146849}{146913}I'm second-guessing myself,|which is nuts.
{146948}{147022}I've always made whatever candy|I felt like, and I...
{147173}{147220}That's just it, isn't it?
{147224}{147333}I make the candy I feel like, but now|I feel terrible, so the candy's terrible.
{147361}{147423}You're very good.
{147710}{147758}Pity about that chocolate fellow,|Wendell... Walter.
{147799}{147847}- Willy Wonka.|- That's the one.
{147867}{147937}Says here in the paper his new candies|aren't selling very well.
{147952}{148039}But I suppose maybe he's just a rotten egg|who deserves it.
{148043}{148111}- Yep.|- Oh, really?
{148121}{148170}You ever met him?
{148174}{148213}I did.
{148217}{148330}I thought he was great at first,|but then he didn't turn out so nice.
{148346}{148393}He also has a funny haircut.
{148397}{148429}I do not!
{148453}{148522}- Why are you here?|- I don't feel so hot.
{148536}{148590}What makes you feel better|when you feel terrible?
{148599}{148633}My family.
{148724}{148766}What do you have against my family?
{148785}{148867}It's not just your family.|It's the whole idea of...
{148945}{148994}They tell you what to do,|what not to do...
{148998}{149057}...and it's not conducive|to a creative atmosphere.
{149071}{149163}Usually they're just trying to protect you|because they love you.
{149211}{149272}If you don't believe me, you should ask.
{149276}{149347}Ask who? My father?
{149357}{149397}No way.
{149430}{149465}At least, not by myself.
{149488}{149519}You want me to go with you?
{149571}{149674}Hey. Hey, what a good idea. Yeah!
{149738}{149795}And you know what? I've got transport...
{149888}{149967}I have to be more careful|where I park this thing.
{150695}{150755}I think we've got the wrong house.
{151104}{151139}Do you have an appointment?
{151152}{151202}No. But he's overdue.
{151282}{151330}Open.
{151355}{151472}Now, let's see what the damage is,|shall we?
{152445}{152481}Heavens.
{152485}{152561}I haven't seen bicuspids|like these since...
{152659}{152702}Since...
{152924}{152955}Willy?
{153000}{153035}Hi, Dad.
{153299}{153352}All these years...
{153371}{153421}...and you haven't flossed.
{153472}{153515}Not once.
{154119}{154218}{y:i}It was on this day that Willy Wonka|{y:i}repeated his offer to Charlie...
{154222}{154288}{y:i}... who accepted on one condition.
{154292}{154347}Sorry we're late. We were brainstorming.
{154351}{154398}Thought I heard thunder.
{154402}{154489}- You staying for dinner, Willy?|- Yes, please.
{154500}{154550}I'll shuffle the plates.
{154756}{154835}You smell like peanuts.
{154844}{154925}- I love peanuts.|- Oh, thank you.
{154929}{154969}You smell like...
{154973}{155017}...old people and soap.
{155087}{155126}I like it.
{155237}{155298}Elbows off the table, Charlie.
{155302}{155350}How do you feel about|little raspberry kites?
{155361}{155399}With licorice instead of string.
{155425}{155509}- Boys, no business at the dinner table.|- Sorry, Mom.
{155522}{155594}I think you're on to something,|though, Charlie.
{155865}{155982}{y:i}In the end, Charlie Bucket|{y:i}won a chocolate factory.
{156014}{156127}{y:i}But Willy Wonka got something|{y:i}even better:
{156143}{156202}{y:i}A family.
{156234}{156334}{y:i}And one thing was absolutely certain:
{156344}{156440}{y:i}Life had never been sweeter.
