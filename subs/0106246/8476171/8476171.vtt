00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:41.500
<i>My father took these.
He was a maniac for the camera.</i>

2
00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.127
<i>That's me.</i>

3
00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.507
<i>That's Felipe and Nando.</i>

4
00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:54.304
<i>That's Alex Morales.
He died instantly.</i>

5
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.476
<i>That's Antonio,
captain of the team.</i>

6
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.648
<i>After 20 years,
you analyze a lot.</i>

7
00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:08.110
<i>You remember people, heroism.</i>

8
00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:12.155
"The Miracle of the Andes",
that's what they called it.

9
00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:16.368
Many people
come up to me and say

10
00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:20.539
that had they been there,
they surely would have died.

11
00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.749
But that makes no sense.

12
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:28.171
Because until you're
in a situation like that...

13
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:33.719
you have no idea
how you'll behave.

14
00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:41.393
To be affronted by solitude
without decadence,

15
00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:45.856
or a single material thing
to prostitute it

16
00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:48.567
elevates you
to a spiritual plane...

17
00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:54.323
where I felt
the presence of God.

18
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.077
Now, there's the God they taught
me about at school...

19
00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:04.750
and there is the God
that's hidden

20
00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:09.880
by what surrounds us
in this civilization.

21
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.884
<i>That's the God I met
on the mountain.</i>

22
00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.622
Steward, could you get me
some tea, please?

23
00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:44.665
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.625
- Want some tea?
- No, thanks.

25
00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.460
That's it.

26
00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.010
Come on, Diego!
Throw it here! Over here!

27
00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.722
Here! Hey, Juan!

28
00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:04.601
Watch out!

29
00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:08.355
Where did you stay in Paris,
left bank, or the right?

30
00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:09.731
Excuse me, please.

31
00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:12.067
Paris is not for you, Canessa.

32
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:15.195
- Why not?
- You're too intense for Paris.

33
00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:17.447
How can I justify
that to the guys?

34
00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.992
He missed practice one day last
week, and once the week before.

35
00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:24.538
- I think he is all right.
- He missed the plane too.

36
00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.958
Look, I'm team captain.
I'll say what's okay.

37
00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.253
If you wanna play rugby,
if you wanna play on a team,

38
00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.088
you got to be there 100%.

39
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.506
- Right?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.175
Okay. Everybody to the right
side of the plane.

41
00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:38.802
Just kidding.

42
00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:40.220
Let me get in.

43
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.848
- Okay, one, two...
- Go on.

44
00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:49.896
- Mama, look.
- Look at what?

45
00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.357
The mountains.
They're so beautiful. Look.

46
00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.443
Don't make me
look at the mountains, Susana.

47
00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:56.987
- They look like big teeth.
- Oh, don't worry.

48
00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:58.697
We're gonna be on the ground
in 20 minutes.

49
00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:02.159
Good. Let's talk
about something else.

50
00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.495
- Have a chocolate.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.212
It's clouding up a bit.

52
00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.602
Just stay above the weather.

53
00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:30.979
No problem.

54
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.523
What's more important to you?
Rugby or girls?

55
00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.694
Girls. You?

56
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:40.405
Girls.

57
00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:43.909
But when I'm playing rugby,
it's the most important thing.

58
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:45.619
Unless girls are watching?

59
00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.079
Right.

60
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.043
Come on, man, switch seats.
I want to see the mountains.

61
00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.840
Don't climb
on the seats, okay?

62
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.885
- Watch yourself.
- All right.

63
00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:09.142
Uruguayan 571,
cleared to 10,000 ft. Thank you.

64
00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:10.977
Your tea, sir.
Thank you.

65
00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:13.939
Turning on the seat belt sign,
steward.

66
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.358
Get those kids to sit down
back there.

67
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.401
We're gonna go to a little
weather on our approach.

68
00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:19.611
Okay.

69
00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:35.919
We'll be landing soon.
Everybody, please sit down.

70
00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:38.672
All right, guys.
Everybody, please sit down.

71
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.758
Do you think they hear you?

72
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.847
Come on now. Sit down.

73
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:07.868
See? I told you. Now sit down!

74
00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.452
All right. Anything to calm
your nerves.

75
00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:14.791
What's going on?

76
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.419
Look what Alonso's doing.

77
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:18.879
Ladies and gentlemen,

78
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.173
put on your parachutes!
We're jumping into the Andes!

79
00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:23.842
Put that down and sit down.

80
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.719
- Ooh!
- All right, all right.

81
00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.397
Put that cigarette out.

82
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:51.453
Whoa!

83
00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:56.541
My God!

84
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.335
You okay?

85
00:06:58.668 --> 00:06:59.836
Nando, is everything all right?

86
00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:02.255
Yes, everything's fine.
It's just an air pocket.

87
00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:04.132
Mom, it scared me, too.

88
00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.108
Mother of God, no!

89
00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.195
- Oh, shit!
- Full throttle. Come on!

90
00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:26.821
Come on!

91
00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:28.907
What happened?

92
00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.868
Are we supposed to fly
that close to the mountains?

93
00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:36.915
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with Thee...

94
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.485
Power!
We need more power!

95
00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:07.696
I can't...!

96
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:46.294
Oh, man!

97
00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:48.797
It's stopped.

98
00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.007
Jesus!

99
00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.804
I think I'm all right.
Alex?

100
00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:03.937
He's dead!

101
00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.899
- Zerbino, are you okay?
- People are hurting, Antonio.

102
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:09.609
I've only been in med school
six months.

103
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.653
- Help me out.
- Okay.

104
00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.822
Eduardo. Where's he going?

105
00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.282
Is Canessa okay?

106
00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:17.742
Yes.

107
00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:19.619
- Where's Eduardo?
- He went back.

108
00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.371
- You'd better go get him.
- Eduardo, come back.

109
00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.456
Help Canessa. Help him.

110
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:25.750
Lilliana!

111
00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:27.460
Lilliana!

112
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.629
Lilliana.

113
00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:31.631
I'm all right.

114
00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:36.678
I can't breathe.

115
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.097
It's the altitude.

116
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.058
You're okay.
Just relax and breathe.

117
00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:45.145
- What should I do?
- Look up there.

118
00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:49.065
Canessa! Help Federico.

119
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.985
His leg is cut.

120
00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.237
I'm fine.
Help the wounded.

121
00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.614
I saved us.
I said the Hail Mary.

122
00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.700
- We didn't expect...
- Move out the way.

123
00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:02.871
What should I do?

124
00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:05.623
Go to the back, get some air.

125
00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:06.791
Okay.

126
00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:13.882
Here. Just sit here.
You are okay.

127
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:18.303
I'm going to use a handkerchief
to clean your nose. Okay?

128
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.523
Bobby! Bobby Francois!

129
00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:35.486
Hey, Carlitos! Smoke?

130
00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:37.280
Yeah.

131
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.047
Stay with me, please.

132
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.843
There's two dead in baggage.
The Solanos.

133
00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.387
- Please!
- Stay with Felipe.

134
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.021
Easy, ma'am, easy.

135
00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:11.856
My legs!

136
00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:16.027
Yes, ma'am,
I'm sorry about your legs.

137
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:19.656
- Roy, are you hurt?
- I don't know.

138
00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:22.408
Come on, then.
Help me. Come on.

139
00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:31.960
Take the other side.
One, two, three!

140
00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:35.880
Alberto.

141
00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:37.298
Dead.

142
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.138
I'm not dead.

143
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.892
Never felt worse in my life,
but I am not dead.

144
00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.560
I- I got check
on the others.

145
00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.522
All right.
Let's move this stuff.

146
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:56.818
Argh! Be careful!
Both my legs are broken.

147
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:01.823
How's Nando?

148
00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:06.744
I don't think so.

149
00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:12.375
Maybe it's just as well.
His mother's dead.

150
00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.669
Please. Please.

151
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.963
- Other people are hurt.
- It's okay, Felipe.

152
00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:19.632
- I'll stay with you.
- Thank you.

153
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.343
Got a minute?

154
00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:23.636
What, Pablo?

155
00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.723
It's this. Is it serious?

156
00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:33.062
- Forget it. You're all right.
- You think so?

157
00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:35.273
Yeah, don't worry about it.
You're strong as an ox.

158
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.651
Give a hand with this seat
over here. Come on.

159
00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:46.242
Here. Tie it up with this shirt,
and I'll see to it later.

160
00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:18.399
Water.

161
00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.949
Mama! Mama!

162
00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:30.870
I want to go home!
I want to go home!

163
00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:34.999
Sit her down here.

164
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.631
Canessa. Canessa!

165
00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.092
You better go see the pilot.

166
00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:46.177
Okay. Help me move her.

167
00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.307
Okay, we're gonna give
it one more try, Mrs. Alfonsin.

168
00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.560
- No, don't. You'll kill me.
- We've got to do it.

169
00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:56.604
Let them do it, ma'am.
They've got to do it.

170
00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:58.856
Maybe we shouldn't.

171
00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.117
One, two, three, pull!

172
00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:11.953
Stop! Stop! Stop!

173
00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.704
We're going to kill her!

174
00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:17.834
I gotta stop. Can't do this.

175
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.293
- My arms...
- This is horrible!

176
00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:22.088
- All right!
- Don't touch it!

177
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.589
Let's get
these loose chairs out,

178
00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:24.590
make some room in here.

179
00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:26.259
Watch his leg.

180
00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:36.144
Water. Water.

181
00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:44.735
Hand me some snow.

182
00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:47.905
Here.

183
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.078
Where's the radio?
We should call Santiago.

184
00:15:56.873 --> 00:16:00.835
We passed Curico.
We passed Curico.

185
00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.253
I found the radio.

186
00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.547
My bag.

187
00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.132
How do we call Santiago?

188
00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:09.886
Eleven... 300.

189
00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:15.766
I got the dial.
11, 300. Okay.

190
00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:20.480
It's dead.
There's no power at all.

191
00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:22.356
My bag.

192
00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:24.066
He wants his bag.

193
00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:27.153
There isn't much in the floor.
I don't see his bag.

194
00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:29.739
- We're looking. What's in it?
- My...

195
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:33.284
My...

196
00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:36.913
My gun. My gun.

197
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.420
No, my friend,
we can't be a part of that.

198
00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.843
Put this up on that side.

199
00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.388
My hands are freezing!

200
00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.894
Well, it's too late.

201
00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:02.772
The rescuers will never
see us today.

202
00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.608
- I guess we'll spend the night.
- Rescuers?

203
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.443
How the hell
they're gonna find us?

204
00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:09.362
Don't worry, they will find us.

205
00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.282
The temperature will drop
when it gets dark.

206
00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:15.159
- Maybe 30, 40 degrees.
- Don't worry.

207
00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:18.079
We'll deal with that.
Don't worry.

208
00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:20.373
I'm cold.

209
00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:23.417
These covers come off.
We can use them as blankets.

210
00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.127
That's a good idea.

211
00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:28.839
Everybody, let's unzip
these covers off the sits,

212
00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:30.758
to use as blankets.

213
00:17:31.342 --> 00:17:33.594
Pablo. How's your stomach?
Good. Fine.

214
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:35.054
Good.

215
00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.098
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

216
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.308
- Who's that?
- Canessa. Come on!

217
00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:43.104
I thought it was just a coat,

218
00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.064
but when I went to take it,
there he was.

219
00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:52.196
- Are you hurt?
- Identify yourself!

220
00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:53.698
Identify yourself!

221
00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:58.119
My name is Roberto Canessa.
I'm a medical student.

222
00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.790
I'm a member of the rugby team
that chartered this plane.

223
00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:06.836
You're a member
of the flight crew, aren't you?

224
00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.590
Aren't you?

225
00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:14.927
Yes. I'm the mechanic.

226
00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:16.637
Do you know how to fix radios?

227
00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:19.849
No.

228
00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.358
You took this coat off a girl,

229
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:30.776
- didn't you?
- No!

230
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.404
You're right.
This is Anna Parrado's coat.

231
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.823
Go put it back on her.

232
00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:38.993
Take it off her again,
I'll kill you.

233
00:18:42.413 --> 00:18:43.372
Excuse me.

234
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.583
- How you doing?
- I'm going to bed.

235
00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:46.751
That way?

236
00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:50.171
Come on, Eduardo.
He bumped his head.

237
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.104
Hey, Roberto?

238
00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:10.483
Want some wine?

239
00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.026
Thanks.

240
00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.033
Where'd you get wine?

241
00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:23.037
Hugo found a shitload
of bottles in this cargo.

242
00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:25.331
He thinks it was the pilot's.

243
00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:28.751
Well, it would explain
how he flew his plane.

244
00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:34.173
We're completely screwed.

245
00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:36.801
I don't know.

246
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.975
Get back there
and help the others.

247
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.488
We're gonna be fine.

248
00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:01.033
Who are you trying to convince,
Antonio?

249
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:09.875
I had no premonition.

250
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.464
So much for ESP.

251
00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:21.595
That was a very good idea
about the seat covers.

252
00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.306
Thank you.

253
00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:27.518
Have some wine.

254
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:29.937
Thanks.

255
00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:33.566
Got all the covers.

256
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.402
Put them inside.
Near the front.

257
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:17.526
I'm dying!

258
00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:21.781
Oh, my sweet God in Heaven,
the pain!

259
00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.992
I'm in so much pain.

260
00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:26.952
It must be terrible.

261
00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:29.789
Calm yourself.
God will take care of you.

262
00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:32.124
My legs!

263
00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.796
God forgive you all
for not helping me!

264
00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:39.632
- I'm in agony!
- Shut up!

265
00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:43.219
Shut up, you stupid cow,
or I'll punch your face in!

266
00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:53.020
I swear to God, I will.
Shut up.

267
00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.623
God, it's cold!
It's too cold!

268
00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:15.084
Antonio!

269
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.878
It's too cold.
We're going to freeze.

270
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:21.382
Roy.

271
00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:23.884
Roy.

272
00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:27.596
Roy! Come on, Roy.

273
00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:30.266
We've got to stuff up this hole.

274
00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:32.768
Come on,
or we'll freeze to death!

275
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.812
- With what?
- With the luggage and stuff.

276
00:22:35.104 --> 00:22:36.772
- Come on. Come on!
- I'm so cold, Antonio.

277
00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:39.275
- Grab a suitcase.
- What are you doing?

278
00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:41.652
- Come on. You too, Rafael.
- I'm freezing!

279
00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:43.654
We've got to stuff up this hole.

280
00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:46.490
Here, help me
with this seat, Rafael.

281
00:22:47.741 --> 00:22:49.243
- We put it on the bottom...
- Okay.

282
00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:52.913
...with the suitcases.
Give me a hand.

283
00:23:01.338 --> 00:23:02.590
Carlitos?

284
00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:05.509
Are you awake?

285
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:06.802
Are you serious?

286
00:23:07.094 --> 00:23:08.846
- Know what I think?
- What?

287
00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:10.890
I think Nando's not so bad.

288
00:23:14.268 --> 00:23:15.686
I don't know.

289
00:23:15.978 --> 00:23:18.147
Let's put him between us
so we keep him warm.

290
00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:26.322
Be careful with his head.
Move him over.

291
00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:31.201
Blanket.

292
00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:34.580
Canessa, Hugo's trying
to revive Nando.

293
00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:36.206
I'm not doing anything else
to help anybody.

294
00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:37.333
I've done enough!

295
00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:39.460
I hate these idiots.
If you don't shut up,

296
00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:41.629
I'll hate you too!
Leave me alone.

297
00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:46.967
I feel sick to my stomach.

298
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.804
Here.
Try and sleep, Javier.

299
00:23:58.145 --> 00:24:01.607
It's just altitude sickness.
Don't be scared.

300
00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:04.401
Thanks.

301
00:24:40.813 --> 00:24:41.939
Well, we have cigarettes.

302
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:43.190
Yeah.

303
00:24:44.108 --> 00:24:45.693
How will they find us?

304
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.028
They have to know
about where we went down.

305
00:24:48.696 --> 00:24:50.155
Don't worry, they'll find us.

306
00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:04.837
- What happened?
- You knocked your head.

307
00:25:05.129 --> 00:25:06.880
- We crashed?
- Yeah.

308
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:10.300
Unbelievable.

309
00:25:11.802 --> 00:25:14.888
He's dead.
Help me move him out.

310
00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:16.724
- Roberto.
- He's dead?

311
00:25:17.016 --> 00:25:18.308
- Roberto.
- Yeah.

312
00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:21.103
Help move him to the back.

313
00:25:21.895 --> 00:25:23.772
We have to keep these
out of the cabin.

314
00:25:24.314 --> 00:25:26.150
Come on,
Carlitos, help me.

315
00:25:27.985 --> 00:25:29.319
How are you, Susana?

316
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:31.905
My feet hurt.

317
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.451
Anybody with a broken arm or leg

318
00:25:35.743 --> 00:25:38.037
should go and lay it
in the snow.

319
00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:40.456
It'll help the swelling go down.

320
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.638
They've gotten cold.

321
00:25:58.515 --> 00:25:59.558
How's that?

322
00:26:00.642 --> 00:26:01.894
Thank you.

323
00:26:10.027 --> 00:26:11.153
What's the story in here?

324
00:26:12.863 --> 00:26:14.323
They're both dead.

325
00:26:15.449 --> 00:26:16.867
You're the mechanic, right?

326
00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:22.664
- Do you have any signal flares?
- No.

327
00:26:23.207 --> 00:26:24.166
Emergency supplies?

328
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.418
No. Nothing like that.

329
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.921
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with you?

330
00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:34.760
What about the radio?

331
00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:38.430
What about the radio?

332
00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:41.100
Can it be made to work?

333
00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:43.936
God! Not without batteries!

334
00:26:45.896 --> 00:26:47.523
Well, are there batteries
or not?

335
00:26:48.315 --> 00:26:49.233
Huh?

336
00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:53.237
The batteries are in the tail,
and the tail's gone!

337
00:26:59.868 --> 00:27:01.328
Forget him, he's crazy.

338
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.705
Anyway, it doesn't really matter
about the radio.

339
00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:06.208
It would be nice,
but they'll find us

340
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.293
- with or without a radio.
- Are you sure?

341
00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:10.045
I haven't a doubt in my mind.

342
00:27:23.725 --> 00:27:24.810
Who's that?

343
00:27:27.354 --> 00:27:30.274
The woman who was screaming
all night, Mrs. Alfonsin.

344
00:27:31.066 --> 00:27:32.359
Don't tell me it's her.

345
00:27:33.152 --> 00:27:34.027
What's the matter?

346
00:27:35.237 --> 00:27:37.990
I yelled at her,
told her to shut up.

347
00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:41.076
We all wanted to, Carlitos.

348
00:27:41.368 --> 00:27:44.079
But I did. Now, she's dead.

349
00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:48.625
I'm so ashamed.

350
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.088
God forgive me!

351
00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:54.756
Take it easy.

352
00:28:00.012 --> 00:28:02.055
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

353
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:03.849
hallowed be thy name.

354
00:28:04.141 --> 00:28:06.018
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

355
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.061
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

356
00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:10.189
Give us this day
our daily bread,

357
00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.274
and forgive us our trespasses

358
00:28:12.566 --> 00:28:15.152
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

359
00:28:15.444 --> 00:28:18.447
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

360
00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:19.573
Amen.

361
00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:23.368
Chocolate-covered
peanuts, small chocolate bars,

362
00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.828
four bottles of wine,

363
00:28:25.162 --> 00:28:27.915
half bottle of run
and nine crackers.

364
00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:29.791
How many of us are there?

365
00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:31.251
Twenty-seven.

366
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.128
- We're gonna starve.
- Look...

367
00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:37.216
this weather can't last.
There'll probably be helicopters

368
00:28:37.507 --> 00:28:39.176
coming over those mountains
this afternoon.

369
00:28:39.468 --> 00:28:41.887
But we'll be careful
and ration what we have.

370
00:28:42.596 --> 00:28:43.972
I like a big lunch.

371
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.352
One capful of wine,
one square of chocolate each.

372
00:28:48.644 --> 00:28:50.437
I prefer a big lunch
to a big dinner.

373
00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:52.522
Come on. Form a line.

374
00:28:56.026 --> 00:28:57.194
Careful.

375
00:29:00.197 --> 00:29:02.491
Thank you, Antonio for the teeny
chocolate piece.

376
00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:03.784
You're welcome.

377
00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:05.577
Fill this.
It's not for me.

378
00:29:05.994 --> 00:29:07.829
- And who's it for?
- Nando.

379
00:29:08.372 --> 00:29:10.999
- He's unconscious.
- He still gets a share.

380
00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:12.251
Give it to him.

381
00:29:17.339 --> 00:29:18.674
The king is generous today.

382
00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:28.934
Lift up his head.

383
00:29:35.649 --> 00:29:36.858
He looks better.

384
00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.777
Yeah. He looks fabulous.

385
00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:43.407
Thank God
we have cigarettes.

386
00:29:43.699 --> 00:29:45.033
Thousands of cigarettes.

387
00:29:45.325 --> 00:29:47.411
I could smoke till
my brain dries up, you know?

388
00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:52.874
What's that?

389
00:29:56.378 --> 00:29:57.504
It's an airplane!

390
00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:02.968
It's the search party!

391
00:30:12.853 --> 00:30:15.439
If we can't see them,
they can't see us.

392
00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:54.895
What is that you're humming?

393
00:30:55.354 --> 00:30:57.189
"The Look of Love. "

394
00:31:00.275 --> 00:31:01.777
How beautiful.

395
00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:05.655
I'm thinking about our children.

396
00:31:06.156 --> 00:31:07.115
Yeah.

397
00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:11.578
Me too. Home.

398
00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:59.000
There's one of these
inside the back of each chair.

399
00:31:59.292 --> 00:32:01.044
- Uh-huh.
- Snow.

400
00:32:03.213 --> 00:32:05.006
It'll melt and make water.

401
00:32:05.298 --> 00:32:07.092
You're a genius, Peter.

402
00:32:07.384 --> 00:32:10.095
This is terrific.
Make more of these.

403
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.013
I'll mark off a big square
of snow

404
00:32:12.305 --> 00:32:14.599
so nobody will piss on it.
Daniel, come help me.

405
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.065
Antonio's got the makings
of a dictator, right?

406
00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:23.442
No comment.

407
00:32:30.282 --> 00:32:32.325
- Coche?
- Yeah?

408
00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:34.578
Play "Flight
of the Bumble Bee. "

409
00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:36.997
Fuck you.

410
00:32:46.298 --> 00:32:49.885
To be fair to this dilemma,
this is a beautiful spot.

411
00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:54.931
Not a tree, not a bird,
not a blade of grass.

412
00:32:55.724 --> 00:32:57.309
Yeah, paradise.

413
00:32:58.268 --> 00:33:01.313
You guys could help.
There's things to do here.

414
00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.064
Stuff it, Roy!

415
00:33:06.943 --> 00:33:09.404
I'll pay for the pizza
if you go and get it.

416
00:33:15.452 --> 00:33:16.828
How are you doing?

417
00:33:18.205 --> 00:33:19.456
Let me sleep.

418
00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:21.833
Canessa

419
00:33:22.709 --> 00:33:23.710
What?

420
00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:25.504
Canessa, look at Nando.

421
00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:29.174
I think he's all right.
I think he's all right.

422
00:33:30.091 --> 00:33:32.135
- I think he's waking up.
- Nando?

423
00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:34.346
Nando.

424
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:36.890
See? I told you.

425
00:33:38.808 --> 00:33:41.269
Don't grind your teeth,
you'll ruin your smile.

426
00:33:43.813 --> 00:33:44.773
Nando.

427
00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:50.820
Focus on me. Come on.
Focus on me. Focus on me.

428
00:33:58.662 --> 00:34:00.705
Roberto Canessa.

429
00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:03.708
- He knows you.
- Yeah.

430
00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:05.710
What happened?

431
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.090
We crashed.

432
00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:15.554
My mother?

433
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:19.849
She's dead.

434
00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:29.442
No, no, no, Nando.
Listen! Forget your mother!

435
00:34:30.652 --> 00:34:32.279
Your sister's alive.
Susana's alive.

436
00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:34.322
She needs you 'cause
she's hurt. She needs you

437
00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:35.949
- to take care of her.
- Where is she?

438
00:34:36.241 --> 00:34:37.909
You need to rest first.
You've being unconscious.

439
00:34:38.201 --> 00:34:39.703
Where is she? Where is she?

440
00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:44.207
Susana!

441
00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:47.502
- Susana!
- Nan...

442
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.337
Nando?

443
00:34:50.046 --> 00:34:51.339
Susana?

444
00:35:01.975 --> 00:35:03.268
I'm here now.

445
00:35:48.938 --> 00:35:50.440
Hey!

446
00:36:06.581 --> 00:36:08.541
There's a plane! Come on!

447
00:36:15.215 --> 00:36:16.883
Can they see us?
Can they see us?

448
00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:18.760
- Of course they can!
- Hey!

449
00:36:19.052 --> 00:36:20.470
- Here we are!
- Beautiful!

450
00:36:20.762 --> 00:36:21.471
Hey!

451
00:36:25.934 --> 00:36:28.395
He dipped his wings!
He dipped his wings!

452
00:36:28.687 --> 00:36:29.854
Yeah! He dipped his wings!

453
00:36:30.146 --> 00:36:32.774
The wings, they dipped!
I saw it!

454
00:36:33.066 --> 00:36:34.234
- You saw it too?
- I saw it!

455
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:37.112
I knew they would find us!
I knew it!

456
00:36:40.657 --> 00:36:41.533
We're saved!

457
00:36:44.828 --> 00:36:46.830
We're going home!

458
00:36:47.914 --> 00:36:50.417
- Pizza for everybody!
- Yes!

459
00:36:58.383 --> 00:37:01.261
We're going home,
Federico! We're going home.

460
00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:02.595
Thank God!

461
00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:06.766
- How are you guys doing?
- Fine.

462
00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:08.852
- Good.
- Drink some of this.

463
00:37:09.144 --> 00:37:10.145
Thank.

464
00:37:10.603 --> 00:37:12.147
What about the rationing?

465
00:37:12.522 --> 00:37:14.232
We've been seen. Drink.

466
00:37:14.524 --> 00:37:15.483
Yeah.

467
00:37:51.728 --> 00:37:53.188
Antonio's asleep.

468
00:37:54.063 --> 00:37:56.316
Look at Roy.
He's asleep too.

469
00:37:56.608 --> 00:37:58.359
He even sleeps
to Antonio's beat.

470
00:37:59.319 --> 00:38:00.528
He's like his dog.

471
00:38:02.405 --> 00:38:04.449
Carlitos, pass the piss pot.

472
00:38:10.246 --> 00:38:11.498
How will they save us?

473
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:12.707
Helicopters.

474
00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:14.626
A plane. A big plane.

475
00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:16.085
There has to be helicopters,
Pedro.

476
00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:18.087
- There's no place to land.
- We landed.

477
00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:21.591
Yeah, right! We landed
like that.

478
00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:25.845
What is that?

479
00:38:27.514 --> 00:38:28.640
Chocolate.

480
00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:32.644
Go on. It's only got to last
until tomorrow.

481
00:38:32.936 --> 00:38:34.521
He's right.
Give me a piece.

482
00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:38.399
Do you think we should be
doing that?

483
00:38:39.192 --> 00:38:40.819
Why not? It's over.

484
00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:42.695
The helicopters are coming
in the morning.

485
00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:44.781
We should wait
till we see the helicopters.

486
00:38:45.073 --> 00:38:46.199
Oh...

487
00:39:12.141 --> 00:39:15.228
- How are you feeling?
- Not bad. Time to eat?

488
00:39:15.645 --> 00:39:16.855
Yeah.

489
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.991
- Where are they?
- They're coming.

490
00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.661
It's gonna be dark soon.

491
00:39:34.664 --> 00:39:37.876
What's this?
What the hell is this?!

492
00:39:38.418 --> 00:39:39.210
What's the matter?

493
00:39:41.129 --> 00:39:44.966
Am I losing my mind?
I must be losing my mind.

494
00:39:47.093 --> 00:39:48.595
Who has been in this box?

495
00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:52.557
What pig has been in this box?

496
00:39:55.101 --> 00:39:57.228
Don't you know that you're
playing with our lives?

497
00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:00.398
There's virtually nothing left!

498
00:40:02.275 --> 00:40:03.610
Why didn't you take a knife

499
00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:05.862
and slit our throats
while we slept?

500
00:40:07.196 --> 00:40:08.406
Who was it?

501
00:40:13.953 --> 00:40:15.371
Who was it?

502
00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:18.333
It was me.

503
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.086
I can't believe it!

504
00:40:24.631 --> 00:40:25.840
I thought they were
picking us up.

505
00:40:26.215 --> 00:40:29.886
And they will!
But it could be a land rescue!

506
00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:33.306
They may have to come
to these mountains on foot!

507
00:40:33.765 --> 00:40:35.808
It could take days, a week!

508
00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:40.104
We have nothing to eat!
We're trapped!

509
00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:42.607
I know, Antonio, but I thought
they were coming this morning.

510
00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:45.443
Who are you to dare
with my life? Huh?

511
00:40:45.735 --> 00:40:47.195
Who are you
against the rest of us?

512
00:40:47.487 --> 00:40:49.822
It wasn't just him, Antonio.
I stole food too.

513
00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:51.532
- Me, too.
- I drank wine.

514
00:40:51.824 --> 00:40:53.576
- I ate chocolate.
- Me too.

515
00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:55.453
Everybody took some, Antonio,

516
00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:58.122
except for maybe
Javier and Lilliana.

517
00:40:59.082 --> 00:41:01.250
The only reason I didn't
is because I'm nauseous.

518
00:41:01.626 --> 00:41:02.669
Not to me!

519
00:41:09.926 --> 00:41:11.719
Am I the leader of this group?

520
00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:13.596
I don't know. Are you?

521
00:41:15.348 --> 00:41:17.058
I'm the captain of the team.

522
00:41:18.935 --> 00:41:20.395
Is this still a team,

523
00:41:20.728 --> 00:41:23.272
or a bunch of cut-throats now
after each other?

524
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.402
Answer me!

525
00:41:29.946 --> 00:41:31.280
Shall we take a vote?

526
00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:33.408
We don't need to.
You're leader.

527
00:41:39.455 --> 00:41:41.124
Answer me this, Antonio.

528
00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:44.836
If they saw us,
even if it is a land rescue,

529
00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:47.714
why haven't they
dropped any supplies?

530
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.845
They could have done that.

531
00:41:54.387 --> 00:41:56.347
They would have
done that by now.

532
00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:17.785
Uh, I have an idea to build

533
00:42:18.453 --> 00:42:20.788
two hammocks
for Federico and Alberto.

534
00:42:22.165 --> 00:42:23.583
It would be better
for their legs.

535
00:42:24.167 --> 00:42:26.294
- You gonna help me, Zerbino?
- Sure.

536
00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:28.379
I'll help too.

537
00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:32.258
I saw some poles and straps.
I'm sure we can do it.

538
00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:38.765
It's been five days.
This is the fifth day.

539
00:42:40.683 --> 00:42:42.018
I'm hungry.

540
00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:50.276
- Lift it up.
- Okay.

541
00:42:52.779 --> 00:42:56.991
Just like new.
Okay, we need two more belts.

542
00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:04.749
Hey, look! It's a radio!

543
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:06.084
I wish it were a transmitter.

544
00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:07.668
Does it work?

545
00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:08.961
I hear static.

546
00:43:10.463 --> 00:43:11.839
You'd better get it to Antonio
right away

547
00:43:12.131 --> 00:43:14.133
- before he starts yelling.
- Okay.

548
00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:18.429
Will we get this done
before dark or what?

549
00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:19.639
Sure.

550
00:43:25.895 --> 00:43:29.190
I can hear something.
We'll have to make an aerial.

551
00:43:29.857 --> 00:43:33.653
Where are the planes?
Where are the planes?

552
00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:46.749
- How is she?
- I don't know. She's asleep.

553
00:43:48.084 --> 00:43:49.710
And how are you, Nando?

554
00:43:50.586 --> 00:43:54.298
Me? Fine. Don't worry.

555
00:43:56.509 --> 00:43:58.261
No helicopters yet.

556
00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:02.390
She's dying.

557
00:44:02.932 --> 00:44:04.058
You can't know that.

558
00:44:05.601 --> 00:44:07.145
And when she's dead,

559
00:44:07.436 --> 00:44:09.564
I'm gonna climb out of these
goddamned mountains,

560
00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:13.734
back to my father,
back to my room in my house.

561
00:44:14.026 --> 00:44:14.902
How you're gonna do that?

562
00:44:15.194 --> 00:44:17.155
- You'll freeze to death.
- Not if I wear enough clothes.

563
00:44:17.446 --> 00:44:19.949
You'd starve to death.
You can't climb a mountain

564
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:22.869
on a little piece of chocolate
and a sip of wine.

565
00:44:23.953 --> 00:44:25.997
Then I'll cut some meat
off the pilots.

566
00:44:29.959 --> 00:44:33.045
After all, they got us
into this mess.

567
00:44:40.553 --> 00:44:42.013
How you doing?

568
00:44:43.139 --> 00:44:45.683
Okay. You?

569
00:44:47.476 --> 00:44:50.438
I'm better.
At least I'm off the floor.

570
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.524
- Right.
- How's your leg?

571
00:44:56.402 --> 00:44:57.945
I don't know.

572
00:44:59.655 --> 00:45:00.823
Mine are bad.

573
00:45:07.496 --> 00:45:08.956
It'll be okay.

574
00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:35.983
- Nando.
- Ah, thanks.

575
00:45:36.817 --> 00:45:38.611
Have you looked
at Alberto's legs?

576
00:45:41.072 --> 00:45:41.906
Yeah.

577
00:45:43.032 --> 00:45:45.368
Alberto's legs are
much worse than mine.

578
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.706
Alberto and you
both have problems.

579
00:46:09.058 --> 00:46:11.060
Let me tell you something,
Roberto.

580
00:46:12.228 --> 00:46:16.274
My name is Federico Aranda
and I will return.

581
00:46:18.693 --> 00:46:19.777
Okay.

582
00:46:20.403 --> 00:46:23.531
Now, Alberto's in much
worse shape than me.

583
00:46:23.823 --> 00:46:26.492
We've got to keep an eye
on Alberto.

584
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.996
Okay. Okay, Federico.

585
00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:37.712
Shut up! Shut up!
Don't talk that way!

586
00:46:40.423 --> 00:46:44.051
- All I said was Antonio...
- Don't say it again.

587
00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:46.387
- What's happening?
- Antonio heard on the radio

588
00:46:46.679 --> 00:46:48.597
- that no planes have seen us.
- Yet.

589
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.350
- It looks bad.
- Shut up, Rafael!

590
00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:55.354
We're gonna have to climb.
Maybe we can find the tail.

591
00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:57.315
The batteries are in the tail.

592
00:46:57.606 --> 00:47:00.234
We can work the transmitter,
call for help.

593
00:47:02.403 --> 00:47:03.571
We've got to do something.

594
00:47:03.863 --> 00:47:06.866
We're going to starve.
Tomorrow, we climb.

595
00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:25.259
How much further is it?

596
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:27.720
Come on!

597
00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:32.850
Come on!

598
00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:37.355
- I can't!
- I'm dying for a breath.

599
00:47:38.397 --> 00:47:42.443
Come on.
Let's take one more push.

600
00:47:44.487 --> 00:47:46.739
Let's do it! That's it.

601
00:47:50.034 --> 00:47:51.160
Hold on!

602
00:47:51.786 --> 00:47:54.497
Come on, grab my feet.
Hold on to them!

603
00:48:01.295 --> 00:48:02.546
We got you!

604
00:48:03.172 --> 00:48:04.298
Hold on, Canessal

605
00:48:06.509 --> 00:48:10.513
Pull me up!
Pull me up!

606
00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:35.287
That was terrible.

607
00:48:39.208 --> 00:48:40.793
I could use some oxygen.

608
00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:44.672
Yeah. Me, too.

609
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.427
We're gonna have to go back.

610
00:48:51.262 --> 00:48:54.807
This is harder than I thought.
I'm so weak.

611
00:48:56.559 --> 00:48:59.603
- Know what Nando said?
- What?

612
00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:04.066
He said if he gets too weak,
he'll eat one of the pilots.

613
00:49:05.818 --> 00:49:08.237
You know,
for crashing the plane.

614
00:49:12.533 --> 00:49:13.909
We better get back.

615
00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:15.786
When the sun drops,
we'll freeze.

616
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.263
Curico.

617
00:49:35.514 --> 00:49:39.268
Pilot said we'd just passed it.
There it is, well into Chile.

618
00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.436
Where did you find the map?

619
00:49:41.145 --> 00:49:42.062
I found it.

620
00:49:42.354 --> 00:49:43.439
He's made a science of it.

621
00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.735
This valley
opens only to the east.

622
00:49:48.027 --> 00:49:50.196
It leads deeper
into the mountains.

623
00:49:50.696 --> 00:49:52.740
The way out is to the west.

624
00:49:53.032 --> 00:49:54.742
To the west is Chile.

625
00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:59.455
Over these mountains are
the green valleys of Chile.

626
00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:03.042
- We can forget that.
- Alberto has a map.

627
00:50:03.709 --> 00:50:05.711
It'll take more than a map
to get out of here.

628
00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:07.838
We've just tried to climb
a little hill,

629
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:09.089
and it kicked our asses.

630
00:50:09.381 --> 00:50:11.800
Who'll climb one
of those mountains, Superman?

631
00:50:12.801 --> 00:50:16.222
At this altitude, with no food,
we're weak as kittens.

632
00:50:17.556 --> 00:50:18.974
I'll tell you right now.

633
00:50:21.769 --> 00:50:24.605
Either we're saved
or we're dead.

634
00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:50.589
The time has come.
No more bullshit.

635
00:50:51.465 --> 00:50:54.677
We've got to pray, man.
Let's say the rosary.

636
00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:59.139
I'm not saying the rosary,
Carlitos. I'm an agnostic.

637
00:50:59.598 --> 00:51:02.893
Don't say it, then.
See if God saves you.

638
00:51:03.435 --> 00:51:05.813
Anybody else want
to roll the dice that way, fine!

639
00:51:15.072 --> 00:51:17.783
- Hail Mary, full of grace...
- The Lord is with Thee.

640
00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:20.744
Blessed art thou amongst women

641
00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:23.706
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

642
00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.417
Holy Mary, mother of God,

643
00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:29.878
pray for us sinners, now
and at the hour of our death.

644
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:31.463
Amen.

645
00:52:34.902 --> 00:52:38.947
I'm not God, you know?
I can't save you.

646
00:52:40.616 --> 00:52:42.326
I can't be responsible.

647
00:52:44.036 --> 00:52:47.039
I tried because I'm captain,
but who could do this?

648
00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:50.876
Who has the strength?
Who has the strength?

649
00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:55.464
Hey, don't be a fool.
That's right, you're not God.

650
00:52:56.882 --> 00:52:59.927
Don't take so much on and you
won't feel so bad, Antonio.

651
00:53:00.511 --> 00:53:03.555
Everybody knows you've
done plenty to keep us together.

652
00:53:04.598 --> 00:53:07.434
I can't help it.
I think of my mother.

653
00:53:08.477 --> 00:53:11.939
I think about my children.
It's the same for me.

654
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.525
And you'll see
them again.

655
00:53:15.818 --> 00:53:18.862
I know [I will.
I know I will.

656
00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.324
Susana's dead.

657
00:53:28.497 --> 00:53:29.998
My sister's dead.

658
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.545
I'm sorry, Nando.

659
00:53:40.676 --> 00:53:43.679
I'll keep her by me tonight,
and tomorrow I'll take her out.

660
00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:10.789
She won't need her coat.

661
00:54:29.725 --> 00:54:31.185
I can't believe it, Roy.

662
00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:36.690
I can't believe it.

663
00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:43.822
They've called off
the search. They've given up.

664
00:54:48.494 --> 00:54:50.078
They think we're dead.

665
00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:55.334
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
You promised! You promised me!

666
00:55:03.258 --> 00:55:04.635
What's going on?

667
00:55:07.012 --> 00:55:10.307
I heard on the radio.
They called off the search.

668
00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:18.732
Get up.
Better go tell the others.

669
00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:23.987
I can't.
It'll kill everybody's hope.

670
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:28.826
What's so great about hope?

671
00:55:36.625 --> 00:55:38.961
Hey, Daniel!
Get everybody together.

672
00:55:44.091 --> 00:55:46.426
All right, all right.
Is everybody here?

673
00:55:47.261 --> 00:55:48.887
Yeah, we're all here.

674
00:55:50.347 --> 00:55:54.142
Okay. Listen,
I got something to tell you.

675
00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:56.770
Good news,
they called off the search.

676
00:55:58.188 --> 00:55:59.857
How is that good news?

677
00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:02.734
‘Cause it means we're going
to get out of here on our own.

678
00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:04.695
We're gonna save ourselves.

679
00:56:04.987 --> 00:56:07.447
Alberto, Chile's to the west,
right?

680
00:56:08.657 --> 00:56:09.700
That's right.

681
00:56:09.992 --> 00:56:10.993
He's crazy!

682
00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.830
It won't work. When we try
to climb, we had no strength.

683
00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:16.164
It's true.

684
00:56:17.708 --> 00:56:19.751
That's 'cause you had no food.

685
00:56:20.669 --> 00:56:22.838
If the search's been called off,
then we're on our own

686
00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:24.882
to save our lives,
and we've got to eat.

687
00:56:25.299 --> 00:56:26.174
Eat what?

688
00:56:41.148 --> 00:56:42.149
No.

689
00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:45.277
The dead?

690
00:56:45.944 --> 00:56:47.988
No.

691
00:56:49.364 --> 00:56:51.033
He means we should eat the dead.

692
00:56:54.453 --> 00:56:55.662
That's right.

693
00:56:57.664 --> 00:56:59.082
We should eat the dead.

694
00:57:01.376 --> 00:57:03.128
It's what we've got to face.

695
00:57:04.588 --> 00:57:06.506
Oh, no. Nando!

696
00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:10.010
Nando's right.

697
00:57:10.302 --> 00:57:11.219
- What?
- I can't believe

698
00:57:11.511 --> 00:57:12.888
what I'm hearing.
You too, Roberto?

699
00:57:14.139 --> 00:57:16.308
You're talking
about eating people!

700
00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:19.061
I'm talking about eating meat
so we don't die.

701
00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:23.857
- I couldn't do it. I couldn't!
- It's disgusting.

702
00:57:24.942 --> 00:57:26.276
It's disgusting, so what?

703
00:57:28.236 --> 00:57:30.697
If I had a wound rotting
and needed to be washed out

704
00:57:30.989 --> 00:57:32.366
wouldn't you do it,
even if it was disgusting,

705
00:57:32.658 --> 00:57:33.867
- because it needed to be done?
- I would.

706
00:57:34.159 --> 00:57:35.494
But I wouldn't eat you.

707
00:57:35.786 --> 00:57:37.371
- Shut up!
- Sorry.

708
00:57:37.996 --> 00:57:39.206
Do you believe we have a soul,

709
00:57:39.498 --> 00:57:41.083
and when we die,
it leaves our body?

710
00:57:41.375 --> 00:57:42.918
I don't know.
I'm not a priest!

711
00:57:43.502 --> 00:57:44.252
Okay.

712
00:57:44.544 --> 00:57:45.796
I don't want to talk about it.

713
00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:48.840
Neither do I, but we have to.
We're starving and trapped.

714
00:57:49.758 --> 00:57:53.637
If the soul leaves when we die,
then the body is a carcass.

715
00:57:54.262 --> 00:57:56.264
This is the beginning
of the end.

716
00:57:56.932 --> 00:57:59.184
What's out there in the snow
Is just meat, Antonio.

717
00:58:00.435 --> 00:58:01.228
Food.

718
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:04.606
I won't do it.
I'd rather die.

719
00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:07.150
I believe in God,
and I fear to have Him judge me

720
00:58:07.442 --> 00:58:08.527
if I do a thing like that.

721
00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:09.820
He put us here.

722
00:58:10.112 --> 00:58:13.115
Maybe he did, as a test,
to see what we'd do,

723
00:58:14.408 --> 00:58:16.284
to see if we'd remain civilized.

724
00:58:17.035 --> 00:58:18.286
I don't think God cares

725
00:58:18.578 --> 00:58:20.122
- whether we're civilized...
- How the hell do you know?

726
00:58:20.414 --> 00:58:22.457
Let Tintin speak.
He never says anything.

727
00:58:23.375 --> 00:58:25.502
I always thought God wants us
to follow our hearts,

728
00:58:25.794 --> 00:58:28.171
use our reason,
struggle to live.

729
00:58:28.463 --> 00:58:30.132
- At any price?
- No.

730
00:58:30.966 --> 00:58:33.260
We shouldn't murder
innocents to live.

731
00:58:33.552 --> 00:58:34.594
What about our innocence?

732
00:58:36.096 --> 00:58:38.807
What'll become our innocence
if we survive as cannibals?

733
00:58:40.475 --> 00:58:42.019
I'm sorry, but I can't do it.

734
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:43.687
I'm with you.

735
00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:45.772
I don't think I could do it.

736
00:58:46.148 --> 00:58:48.025
How could we go back
to our families?

737
00:58:49.443 --> 00:58:51.778
You could go back alive.
I think they'd prefer that.

738
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.907
Roberto, are you ready
to go out there,

739
00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:58.785
and cut flesh from a human body
and eat it?

740
00:59:09.087 --> 00:59:11.339
None of us can decide
a thing like this.

741
00:59:12.007 --> 00:59:13.341
We're alone here.

742
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.969
We could be on the moon,
Jesus Christ.

743
00:59:17.596 --> 00:59:20.348
There must've been situations
like this all the way back,

744
00:59:20.682 --> 00:59:22.059
the first people.

745
00:59:23.101 --> 00:59:24.394
I don't know.

746
00:59:25.937 --> 00:59:28.023
There's nothing left for us
to do but pray.

747
00:59:39.451 --> 00:59:40.452
So?

748
00:59:42.496 --> 00:59:45.624
They're going to pray.
We'll decide in the morning.

749
00:59:51.379 --> 00:59:53.131
What have we done
that God now asks us

750
00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:55.300
to eat the bodies
of our dead friends?

751
00:59:56.593 --> 00:59:58.470
What you think
they would've thought?

752
01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:02.766
I don't know.

753
01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:06.728
I can't sleep.

754
01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:09.272
Hey, don't waste the battery.

755
01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:10.982
I know that if I died...

756
01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:15.320
if my dead body could
help you stay alive...

757
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.115
I'd want you to use it.

758
01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:25.247
In fact, If I do die
and you don't eat me,

759
01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:27.874
I'll come back from wherever
I am and kick your ass!

760
01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:31.378
That's a good one.

761
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.552
Take my hand and pledge with me.

762
01:00:39.678 --> 01:00:41.429
Whoever dies, agrees...

763
01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:44.391
"Use my body as food. "

764
01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:48.812
All right.

765
01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:50.689
I pledge...

766
01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.232
- I agree.
- Me, too.

767
01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:58.196
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

768
01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:02.617
- Carlos?
- I'm thinking.

769
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:09.958
Antonio?

770
01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:17.007
Nando?

771
01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:19.926
Yeah.

772
01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:26.600
Can you just promise,
if you eat me,

773
01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:29.728
that you clean your plates?

774
01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:37.652
God bless you all.

775
01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:50.874
Pablo!

776
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:53.001
- Pablo.
- Yah?

777
01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:54.794
- How's your stomach?
- Oh, it's fine.

778
01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:56.338
Lift your shirt. Let me see.

779
01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.928
- Looks great.
- Told you.

780
01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:04.888
You should be dead, you know.

781
01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:07.807
So what do you think, Tintin?

782
01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:09.851
I think we should eat.

783
01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.901
If we do this,
we'll never be the same again.

784
01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:22.656
It's like Communion.
From their death, we live.

785
01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.283
People will understand.

786
01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:31.665
This should be good
for the cutting.

787
01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.885
All right. Give me that.

788
01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:45.280
It's very difficult to cut.

789
01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:49.617
The meat's almost frozen.
I'm going to eat this piece.

790
01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:27.781
Somebody take this.

791
01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:27.632
Someone take this and eat it.
Come on!

792
01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:34.139
I tell you one thing.

793
01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:37.350
If I have meat in my belly,
I intend to get something done.

794
01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:53.950
Where were you?

795
01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:00.123
You didn't take from my sister,
did you?

796
01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:01.583
No.

797
01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:05.587
No. It wasn't a woman.
I don't know who it was.

798
01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:07.714
How are the others eating?

799
01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.717
- One by one.
- Good.

800
01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:16.473
I'll do what I can, Roberto.
I'm strong when I'm strong.

801
01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:18.433
When I'm not, it's your turn.

802
01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.853
God, she was so beautiful.

803
01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:49.547
Son of a bitch!
They went without me?

804
01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:51.382
You can't go till you eat,
anyway.

805
01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:52.884
They're gonna look
for the tail.

806
01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:56.513
The batteries! With them,
you can work a transmitter.

807
01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:32.924
Can't see them anymore.

808
01:08:01.953 --> 01:08:03.288
Look at that!

809
01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:13.089
Tonight, we pray
for the climbers,

810
01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:15.216
that they come back to us.

811
01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.053
So you pray too, Fito.

812
01:08:19.846 --> 01:08:22.265
Not me. I told you,
I'm an agnostic.

813
01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:24.267
Fito.

814
01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:34.027
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with Thee.

815
01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.237
Blessed art thou amongst women,

816
01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:38.531
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb...

817
01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:04.015
Eat this. Eat it!

818
01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:11.189
You think they're okay?

819
01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:17.153
No. The way
they were dressed...

820
01:09:19.155 --> 01:09:21.157
Had to be 35, 40 below
last night.

821
01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:24.202
They're dead.

822
01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:52.355
It's the sun.

823
01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:54.440
No, we're dreaming.

824
01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:58.486
- What...?
- What?

825
01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:00.780
What?

826
01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:05.576
It's the sun. Thank God!

827
01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.428
Look! It's a seat
from the plane!

828
01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:31.602
It's heavy. Help me!

829
01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:34.480
Ready? Go!

830
01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:44.282
He must've burned.

831
01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:52.206
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking his wallet

832
01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:54.751
and whatever he has
for his mother.

833
01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:57.420
Hey.

834
01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:00.423
There's more over here.

835
01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:17.440
This accounts for those
that are still missing.

836
01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:19.442
Altogether three.

837
01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:21.778
My feet are starting
to freeze again.

838
01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:23.321
We should go back.

839
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.032
Do you want to try something?

840
01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:31.579
Whoo!

841
01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:46.552
Why does it smell
so bad even after you clean it?

842
01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:52.225
It's the infection.
I'll clean it again tonight.

843
01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:56.062
Don't look so downhearted,
Roberto.

844
01:11:56.646 --> 01:12:00.566
Take a lesson from Alberto.
Nothing stops him.

845
01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:03.027
I have abandoned
the Church of Rome

846
01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.738
in favor of Utopia.

847
01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.282
Good for you, Alberto.

848
01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:12.537
And for my part,
my name is Federico Aranda

849
01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:14.205
and I will return.

850
01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:23.923
How is Federico?

851
01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:28.970
He has gangrene, I think.
I know Alberto does.

852
01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.264
Canessa. Canessa!

853
01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:34.475
Look at this! Look at this!

854
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:38.104
- Watch out!
- They're flying.

855
01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:40.147
Whoo!

856
01:12:40.815 --> 01:12:42.149
What the hell! Watch out!

857
01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:43.943
- Watch out!
- To freedom!

858
01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:45.862
Watch out!

859
01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:57.373
They didn't die, Roberto.
Anything is possible.

860
01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:00.376
Whoo-hoo!

861
01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:03.462
There was a piece of the wing.

862
01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:06.424
So the tail must be
up there somewhere.

863
01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:09.760
Here's the plan I propose.

864
01:13:10.136 --> 01:13:11.846
We pick a team to go
after the tail.

865
01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:13.890
- I'll go.
- Me, too.

866
01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:15.850
We feed the team the biggest
rations,

867
01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:17.435
give them the warmest clothes.

868
01:13:17.768 --> 01:13:19.562
And then in, I don't know,
a week,

869
01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:21.272
we go up there,
we find the tail,

870
01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:23.858
get the batteries, bring them
back, crank up the transmitter.

871
01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:27.904
- It gets cold up there.
- I couldn't do it again.

872
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.823
Yeah. Me neither.

873
01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:35.077
I need more money.

874
01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:37.997
Here.

875
01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:44.629
I wish we could have
a fire every night,

876
01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:47.298
and that someone
would go for pizza.

877
01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:51.218
I'll pay if you go.

878
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:55.640
No, I insist.
I'll pay, you go.

879
01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:16.577
I feel God has taken care of us.

880
01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:20.331
Don't you feel it?
A sense of fate?

881
01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:26.587
I feel a sense of fate.

882
01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:32.176
Hi.

883
01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:36.389
I wanted you all to know...

884
01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:42.061
if I die,
you have my permission.

885
01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:44.605
You can eat me.

886
01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.499
If anybody could hear this!

887
01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:07.878
Sit down, Antonio.

888
01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.886
Coche, it's too bad
you didn't play the cello!

889
01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:32.445
Javier?

890
01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:36.449
- What?
- I've decided something.

891
01:15:37.408 --> 01:15:39.118
What's that, sweetie?

892
01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:42.329
I want to have another baby.

893
01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.665
This experience, it's just...

894
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:49.587
It's made me feel
this miracle of life so deeply.

895
01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:51.505
It's not that, my dear.
It's just that

896
01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:53.799
you're not eating.

897
01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:57.511
If you don't eat, how will you
live to have another baby?

898
01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:04.643
You're right.

899
01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:07.396
You're right.

900
01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:14.070
I'll eat some.
I'll do it.

901
01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:19.200
- I'll eat tomorrow.
- Baby.

902
01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:20.743
Yeah. I'll eat tomorrow.

903
01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:26.207
God bless you.

904
01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:04.430
Where is everyone?

905
01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:05.890
I don't know.

906
01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:11.729
Shine the light over here.

907
01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:16.358
Avalanche!

908
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:27.828
Eduardo! Eduardo!

909
01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:31.749
Get out! Get out!

910
01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:36.128
I can't see! I can't see!

911
01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:41.800
- You all right?
- Yeah.

912
01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:44.595
- Who is it?
- Zerbino.

913
01:18:46.013 --> 01:18:47.348
Help!

914
01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.648
Antonio.

915
01:18:58.692 --> 01:18:59.902
Antonio.

916
01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:06.533
Here's somebody!
Here's somebody!

917
01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:07.993
Go, go, go!

918
01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:17.795
Pablo!

919
01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:34.478
Lilliana!

920
01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.898
Hold on!

921
01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:39.650
I'll get...

922
01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:42.069
Lilliana! Help me!

923
01:19:42.486 --> 01:19:44.947
For God's sake,
help me get my wife!

924
01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:48.659
Lilliana!

925
01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:01.297
Please don't take her
from me now!

926
01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:08.220
He's breathing. Nando!

927
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:12.308
Keep digging.
God, please! Nando!

928
01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:13.892
Get him out!

929
01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:19.064
Pull! Pull him out!

930
01:20:32.161 --> 01:20:35.080
Eight are dead.
Eight of us are dead.

931
01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:34.264
We can't go out.
There's a blizzard.

932
01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.268
Let me see.

933
01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:52.533
Roberto...

934
01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:57.663
listen,
today is Rafael's birthday.

935
01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:01.583
So?

936
01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:04.294
We've got to observe
his birthday.

937
01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:27.734
Make a wish.

938
01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:30.737
A wish?

939
01:22:36.243 --> 01:22:38.036
I just wish this was over.

940
01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:50.757
- It's still snowing.
- It's a blizzard.

941
01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:56.847
Roberto, you're not gonna
believe this.

942
01:22:58.515 --> 01:22:59.516
What?

943
01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:01.810
Today is my birthday.

944
01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:11.069
I love you all so much.

945
01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:20.245
And my wish... My wish...

946
01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.716
Tonight, we say
the rosary for the living

947
01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:34.551
and for life itself.

948
01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:38.639
That we have survived
a plane crash,

949
01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:41.808
starvation and an avalanche.

950
01:23:42.976 --> 01:23:45.103
And tonight, Fito,
no more kidding.

951
01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:48.273
You've got to pray
the rosary with us.

952
01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:53.487
I'm not saying no rosary,
Carlitos. I'm an agnostic.

953
01:23:58.033 --> 01:23:59.159
What's that?

954
01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:02.037
My God, it's another avalanche!

955
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:08.168
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with Thee.

956
01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:09.545
Blessed art thou
amongst women

957
01:24:09.836 --> 01:24:11.296
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

958
01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:45.497
Alberto.

959
01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:47.916
Alberto.

960
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:53.964
Light.

961
01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:02.973
Canessa. Zerbino.

962
01:25:05.851 --> 01:25:07.603
Good morning, Carlitos.

963
01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:11.857
Good morning, my friends.
Do you know what today is?

964
01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:14.985
No. What?

965
01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:17.738
Today is my father's birthday.

966
01:25:18.905 --> 01:25:20.198
My father is an artist,

967
01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:23.493
a painter,
and a bit of a madman.

968
01:25:25.162 --> 01:25:27.247
And now in my heart,
with the rise of the sun,

969
01:25:27.748 --> 01:25:29.625
I do believe I'll see him again.

970
01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:33.378
- Do you feel it?
- What?

971
01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:37.299
God.

972
01:25:38.008 --> 01:25:39.676
God is everywhere today.

973
01:26:29.393 --> 01:26:31.395
Help. Over here! I'm here!

974
01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:12.686
This is where the dead were.
Gone under the snow now.

975
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:15.272
It's about the closest
they'll get to a burial.

976
01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:20.444
- I'm worried about Eduardo.
- Why?

977
01:27:21.027 --> 01:27:22.612
He's losing his spirit.

978
01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:54.478
When are we going?

979
01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:56.897
Fifteenth.

980
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:58.607
The fifteenth passed by.

981
01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:00.525
The fifteenth of next month.

982
01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:04.905
That's too long.

983
01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:07.741
Winter's ending.
The nights will get shorter.

984
01:28:08.033 --> 01:28:09.493
It will get warmer.
We'll have a chance.

985
01:28:18.168 --> 01:28:19.544
Alberto...

986
01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.465
why are you crying?

987
01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:27.052
Because I am so close to God.

988
01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.700
Shhhh. It's okay.

989
01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:00.836
So beautiful.

990
01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:06.049
It's beautiful.

991
01:29:16.059 --> 01:29:17.561
Wake up, please.

992
01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:21.940
Wake up, everyone.

993
01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:30.156
My name is Federico Aranda,
and I have to tell you

994
01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:35.829
that Alberto Antuna,
a brave boy, is dead.

995
01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:40.667
He was 21 years old.

996
01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:50.093
Eternal rest grant
unto them, O Lord.

997
01:29:50.594 --> 01:29:53.054
Let perpetual
light shine upon them.

998
01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:56.266
May they rest in peace. Amen.

999
01:30:17.495 --> 01:30:18.580
This should be enough to eat.

1000
01:30:19.205 --> 01:30:20.624
We should wait a few more days.

1001
01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:22.918
- Why?
- Because it'll be warmer.

1002
01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:26.421
I waited until the 15th.

1003
01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:28.548
On the 15th, you said
the weather was no good.

1004
01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.550
On the 16th, you said
the weather was no good.

1005
01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:33.303
I've been waiting on you
for four weeks, Roberto.

1006
01:30:34.054 --> 01:30:36.097
Put your pack on, this is it.

1007
01:30:40.769 --> 01:30:41.937
All right.

1008
01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:45.899
How are you doing, Federico?

1009
01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:50.779
Very well, Nando.
Good luck on your journey.

1010
01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:55.241
Thank you. They tell me
you won't eat, Javier.

1011
01:30:57.953 --> 01:30:58.787
Yeah.

1012
01:31:02.415 --> 01:31:04.501
It's up to you if you want
to get out of here.

1013
01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:07.796
Perhaps.

1014
01:31:10.757 --> 01:31:14.719
Forget your wife! Forget her!
Remember your living children!

1015
01:31:20.934 --> 01:31:22.102
Will you eat?

1016
01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:27.816
I'll eat. I'll eat.

1017
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:31.152
Good.

1018
01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:37.867
Stay well, Federico.
Pray for me.

1019
01:31:38.702 --> 01:31:39.869
I will.

1020
01:31:41.746 --> 01:31:43.748
When we find the tail, we'll
come back with the batteries.

1021
01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:44.916
And if you don't?

1022
01:31:45.208 --> 01:31:47.043
If we don't find the tail,
we'll keep going.

1023
01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:49.546
Going where?
Through the mountains?

1024
01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:50.839
We'll find the tail.

1025
01:31:51.131 --> 01:31:52.716
Roy, you got the radio
or the panel yet?

1026
01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:55.301
Just about.
There's a lot of wires.

1027
01:31:55.802 --> 01:31:56.886
We'll figure it out.

1028
01:31:57.345 --> 01:32:00.432
All right, Eduardo, see these?

1029
01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:03.935
Little shoes.

1030
01:32:04.227 --> 01:32:06.229
Yeah, little red shoes.
Take this one.

1031
01:32:07.981 --> 01:32:11.109
When these are a pair again,
you're going to be going home.

1032
01:32:12.402 --> 01:32:13.528
All right?

1033
01:32:16.281 --> 01:32:17.240
Okay.

1034
01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:19.743
Okay.

1035
01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:23.788
All right. Let's do it!

1036
01:32:58.865 --> 01:33:00.950
Where'd you learn
about transmitters?

1037
01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:06.081
I didn't. I helped my cousins
put together their stereos.

1038
01:33:06.539 --> 01:33:07.832
Now I'm the radio man.

1039
01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:09.834
Our lives depend
on this radio, Roy.

1040
01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:14.214
Who asked you? Don't upset me!
I'm emotional as it is.

1041
01:33:14.506 --> 01:33:15.882
Come on. Leave him alone.

1042
01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:17.258
Let's go.

1043
01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:25.683
Hey!

1044
01:33:25.975 --> 01:33:29.187
Wait till you see...
You're not gonna believe it!

1045
01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:43.993
Chocolate!

1046
01:34:03.429 --> 01:34:04.472
Sweaters!

1047
01:34:05.515 --> 01:34:07.142
Clean underwear!

1048
01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:10.895
A comic book I haven't read!

1049
01:34:13.273 --> 01:34:14.357
Toothpaste!

1050
01:34:16.943 --> 01:34:19.028
Delicious!

1051
01:34:31.124 --> 01:34:32.750
This is a pretty good story.

1052
01:34:36.171 --> 01:34:38.173
Maybe we should
just keep walking tomorrow.

1053
01:34:38.798 --> 01:34:40.633
- What are you talking about?
- We found the batteries.

1054
01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:43.636
Bring them back,
transmit an SOS. That's it.

1055
01:34:44.554 --> 01:34:47.015
Unbelievable. All this time,
the tail was a three-hour walk.

1056
01:34:47.307 --> 01:34:49.058
Maybe we should
just walk to Chile.

1057
01:34:50.894 --> 01:34:53.021
What are you talking about?
You're talking shit.

1058
01:34:53.313 --> 01:34:54.898
We don't have the equipment
to climb these mountains.

1059
01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:56.024
We would die.

1060
01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:00.612
No, we bring the batteries back
and transmit an SOS. That's it.

1061
01:35:02.322 --> 01:35:03.448
One, two, three...

1062
01:35:28.514 --> 01:35:31.100
- That isn't going to work.
- I don't know.

1063
01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:32.727
Maybe we should just
keep walking.

1064
01:35:33.019 --> 01:35:34.479
I'm not throwing my life away

1065
01:35:34.771 --> 01:35:36.856
walking into the mountains.
It's a stupid...

1066
01:35:39.359 --> 01:35:43.196
All right.
This is what we'll do.

1067
01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:48.409
We'll get radio here,
bring it back up here.

1068
01:35:48.701 --> 01:35:50.078
We can't hook up a radio.

1069
01:35:52.372 --> 01:35:53.414
We'll bring Roy.

1070
01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:54.958
I don't want to go.

1071
01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:57.043
We don't know anything
about radios.

1072
01:35:57.335 --> 01:36:00.713
I don't either! All these wires,
I don't know what they are for.

1073
01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:02.548
I just helped my cousins
with their stereo!

1074
01:36:03.216 --> 01:36:04.467
We had a booklet.

1075
01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:05.969
You're going!

1076
01:36:08.763 --> 01:36:11.015
You take it.
You're smarter than me!

1077
01:36:11.557 --> 01:36:15.103
I don't wanna go up in the snow!
I don't wanna go!

1078
01:36:16.354 --> 01:36:20.316
How much further is it?
We've been walking a long time!

1079
01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:22.819
I don't have any strength,
you know?

1080
01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:25.363
I feel sick and weak.

1081
01:36:25.655 --> 01:36:26.906
I wish he'd shut up.

1082
01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:28.491
This was your idea.

1083
01:36:33.413 --> 01:36:34.497
- Careful!
- Sorry.

1084
01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:36.249
You'll burn something up.
Give me this.

1085
01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:38.251
It'll be dark soon.

1086
01:36:39.502 --> 01:36:41.296
I'm going to wrap this stuff
around my legs.

1087
01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:43.006
I wanna be warm tonight.

1088
01:36:43.298 --> 01:36:44.966
Goddamn it!

1089
01:36:45.258 --> 01:36:47.093
- That was youl!
- Why don't you two give that up?

1090
01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:49.929
Huh? We'll make a fire.

1091
01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:51.848
- Tintin.
- Yeah?

1092
01:36:52.181 --> 01:36:53.641
Let's make a fire.

1093
01:36:57.103 --> 01:37:01.482
This stuff worked good.
I feel snug as a bug.

1094
01:37:04.569 --> 01:37:06.863
- What you think we should do?
- Fix the radio.

1095
01:37:07.447 --> 01:37:09.741
- But if we can't fix the radio?
- I don't think it's gonna work.

1096
01:37:10.033 --> 01:37:11.993
When it does work, Roy,
it won't be because of you!

1097
01:37:12.285 --> 01:37:14.287
- I never said I could fix...
- But if it doesn't work,

1098
01:37:14.579 --> 01:37:16.414
what you think we should do?
Huh, Tintin?

1099
01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:20.335
I don't know.
Whatever you two decide.

1100
01:37:21.461 --> 01:37:23.087
Mister Switzerland!

1101
01:37:24.839 --> 01:37:27.258
Well, I think that if the radio
doesn't work, we...

1102
01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:29.052
I'm not climbing
those mountains!

1103
01:37:29.344 --> 01:37:30.720
Then I'll go without you.

1104
01:37:33.264 --> 01:37:36.267
You'll die.
You'll freeze to death.

1105
01:37:36.809 --> 01:37:39.312
No, I won't. Not if we make a
sleeping bag out of this stuff.

1106
01:37:39.604 --> 01:37:41.189
There's enough stuff here
to make a bag.

1107
01:37:57.205 --> 01:37:59.123
Nando! Nando!

1108
01:38:01.793 --> 01:38:03.836
Look at this! Look.

1109
01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:06.672
Oh, wow!

1110
01:38:09.342 --> 01:38:11.552
- Look at that cake.
- Ah...

1111
01:38:25.233 --> 01:38:26.818
Are we going the right way?

1112
01:38:30.363 --> 01:38:31.614
I think so.

1113
01:38:47.547 --> 01:38:48.631
Come on!

1114
01:38:48.923 --> 01:38:49.841
I can't!

1115
01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:52.051
You know you can!

1116
01:38:52.468 --> 01:38:53.553
Just leave mel!

1117
01:38:53.845 --> 01:38:55.847
Nando, we got to keep going!

1118
01:38:56.139 --> 01:38:58.224
We get caught in this,
the sun goes down, we're dead.

1119
01:38:58.516 --> 01:39:00.268
- Go ahead!
- What about Roy?

1120
01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:02.854
You go ahead with Tintin.
Don't look back.

1121
01:39:03.146 --> 01:39:04.480
I'll get Roy to the plane!

1122
01:39:04.897 --> 01:39:06.732
I told you winter wasn't over!

1123
01:39:07.024 --> 01:39:08.901
- Leave me!
- Come on!

1124
01:39:09.193 --> 01:39:10.736
- Come on!
- I can't walk!

1125
01:39:11.028 --> 01:39:13.573
I can't carry you.
You'll kill us both!

1126
01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:17.743
I can't!

1127
01:39:18.619 --> 01:39:22.331
What do you mean you can't, huh?
You piece of shit!

1128
01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:23.791
What you mean you can't?

1129
01:39:24.083 --> 01:39:25.293
You can't tell me
you can't do it!

1130
01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:27.295
Get up and walk ten steps.

1131
01:39:28.004 --> 01:39:30.673
- Get up and walk ten steps!
- All right!

1132
01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.730
It's them!

1133
01:39:53.196 --> 01:39:55.156
- Did the radio work?
- No.

1134
01:39:55.615 --> 01:39:56.741
Where's Nando?

1135
01:39:57.033 --> 01:39:58.159
I don't know.

1136
01:40:13.799 --> 01:40:15.134
Nando

1137
01:40:17.887 --> 01:40:19.388
Come on! Come on!

1138
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:46.415
Carlitos, here!

1139
01:40:47.375 --> 01:40:48.501
Thanks.

1140
01:40:55.341 --> 01:40:58.302
Didn't you see him?
Federico's dead!

1141
01:41:36.966 --> 01:41:38.134
No good.

1142
01:41:38.426 --> 01:41:40.511
- What do you mean no good?
- No good.

1143
01:41:41.262 --> 01:41:42.305
Canessa.

1144
01:41:45.433 --> 01:41:46.726
Try to sleep.

1145
01:41:55.735 --> 01:41:56.861
He's bad.

1146
01:41:57.153 --> 01:41:58.404
What's the matter with him?

1147
01:42:00.031 --> 01:42:03.075
Are you surprised? How long
can people live like this?

1148
01:42:42.865 --> 01:42:44.575
Carlitos says
the sleeping bag's ready.

1149
01:42:45.201 --> 01:42:46.285
It's not ready.

1150
01:42:46.577 --> 01:42:48.329
Yes. It's time to go.
It's time to make this trip.

1151
01:42:48.621 --> 01:42:50.039
We got caught in that storm.
We almost died.

1152
01:42:50.623 --> 01:42:53.125
I told you winter's not over!
Listen to me, Nando.

1153
01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:54.710
You got the will,
I give you that.

1154
01:42:55.002 --> 01:42:56.379
But I have the brains.
I say we wait.

1155
01:42:56.754 --> 01:42:58.255
- Until when?
- The sleeping bag's ready.

1156
01:42:58.547 --> 01:43:00.132
- The sleeping bag is ready!
- It's not ready!

1157
01:43:00.424 --> 01:43:02.551
- The sleeping bag is ready!
- It's not ready!

1158
01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:06.472
Hey.

1159
01:43:08.182 --> 01:43:09.058
Hey.

1160
01:43:12.144 --> 01:43:13.646
Rafael's dead.

1161
01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:25.741
It's time to go, Roberto.
It's time.

1162
01:43:27.284 --> 01:43:28.953
Before we turn into animals.

1163
01:43:36.502 --> 01:43:37.670
All right.

1164
01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:00.943
Nando.

1165
01:44:03.028 --> 01:44:04.488
I still got the shoe!

1166
01:44:06.574 --> 01:44:08.951
I still got mine.

1167
01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:17.918
God be with you.
You'll be okay.

1168
01:44:18.544 --> 01:44:19.628
Thanks.

1169
01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:30.806
Wait! Wait!

1170
01:44:31.098 --> 01:44:32.683
Carlitos, let them go.

1171
01:44:34.226 --> 01:44:37.396
I forgot to tell you.
I had a dream last night,

1172
01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:39.273
a tremendous premonition.

1173
01:44:39.607 --> 01:44:43.152
I saw green fields and flowers.
I could smell the grass.

1174
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:46.906
Your expedition will succeed.

1175
01:44:58.793 --> 01:45:00.544
Don't forget the pizza!

1176
01:46:05.818 --> 01:46:07.027
Here you go.

1177
01:46:30.009 --> 01:46:32.052
That looks like a good place
to camp, right up there.

1178
01:47:16.972 --> 01:47:18.766
I think this is the top.

1179
01:48:01.266 --> 01:48:02.935
Maybe this
leads somewhere.

1180
01:48:03.769 --> 01:48:04.603
Be careful.

1181
01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:11.318
Help, please!

1182
01:48:11.694 --> 01:48:13.612
Nando! Nando!

1183
01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:16.323
You'll fall too!

1184
01:48:17.908 --> 01:48:19.868
Hang on, Roberto!
Give me the strap!

1185
01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.080
I'll get you. Now hold on!

1186
01:48:24.415 --> 01:48:26.166
- Nando!
- Hold on!

1187
01:48:27.459 --> 01:48:28.961
You got me?

1188
01:48:34.049 --> 01:48:35.175
Hold on!

1189
01:48:35.467 --> 01:48:36.969
I got you.

1190
01:48:37.469 --> 01:48:38.721
Hurry!

1191
01:48:39.805 --> 01:48:41.807
- Hurry!
- I got you, I got youl!

1192
01:48:42.099 --> 01:48:43.225
- You got me?
- Yes.

1193
01:48:43.517 --> 01:48:44.685
Hurry up!

1194
01:48:44.977 --> 01:48:46.061
Hold on!

1195
01:48:51.525 --> 01:48:53.652
Now, Tintin! Get me up!

1196
01:49:20.554 --> 01:49:24.224
Grab hold of me.
Pull yourself! Go over me!

1197
01:49:34.318 --> 01:49:37.237
So what do you think?
You want to try the other way?

1198
01:49:38.572 --> 01:49:40.074
Huh?

1199
01:50:05.224 --> 01:50:06.391
You ready, Roberto?

1200
01:50:08.185 --> 01:50:09.645
You see that line?

1201
01:50:12.064 --> 01:50:14.191
- That's a road.
- I can't see anything.

1202
01:50:14.483 --> 01:50:15.651
Do you see it, Tintin?

1203
01:50:17.319 --> 01:50:19.780
I see a line.
I couldn't say if it was a road.

1204
01:50:20.572 --> 01:50:22.032
I think we should go back.

1205
01:50:23.158 --> 01:50:24.284
Go back?

1206
01:50:25.369 --> 01:50:27.996
Yeah.
This mountain's too high.

1207
01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:30.332
What do we do if we go back?

1208
01:50:31.416 --> 01:50:32.417
Go to the road.

1209
01:50:33.794 --> 01:50:35.170
It might be a road,
it might not.

1210
01:50:35.546 --> 01:50:37.297
I've the best eyes.
That's a road.

1211
01:50:40.968 --> 01:50:42.177
I'm going back.

1212
01:50:45.389 --> 01:50:46.765
I'm going on.

1213
01:50:50.561 --> 01:50:52.271
What are you
going to do, Tintin?

1214
01:50:53.105 --> 01:50:54.189
I don't know.

1215
01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:57.067
How about this? We leave
our stuff here with you,

1216
01:50:57.359 --> 01:50:59.194
we go to the top and see.

1217
01:51:00.529 --> 01:51:02.239
Will you wait for us, Roberto?

1218
01:51:04.283 --> 01:51:05.450
All right.

1219
01:51:08.412 --> 01:51:09.872
Then I'm going back.

1220
01:51:42.362 --> 01:51:45.365
I'm going to see
a valley, a river.

1221
01:51:45.741 --> 01:51:48.452
I'm going to see
green trees and hills.

1222
01:52:12.517 --> 01:52:14.561
Tintin! Tintin!

1223
01:52:16.021 --> 01:52:17.397
Go back and get Canessa.

1224
01:52:17.689 --> 01:52:19.191
Tell him it's gonna be
all right.

1225
01:52:20.192 --> 01:52:22.194
Tell him to come up
and see for himself.

1226
01:52:24.613 --> 01:52:27.115
Canessa! Canessa!

1227
01:52:29.034 --> 01:52:31.370
Nando's at the top.

1228
01:52:32.746 --> 01:52:33.747
Did you get there?

1229
01:52:36.541 --> 01:52:39.962
No, but he says it's marvelous.

1230
01:52:43.507 --> 01:52:44.967
I have to rest.

1231
01:53:01.066 --> 01:53:02.192
Nando?

1232
01:53:19.710 --> 01:53:24.214
Mountains!
Nothing but mountains.

1233
01:53:28.218 --> 01:53:29.511
We've had it!

1234
01:53:32.514 --> 01:53:34.391
We've completely had it!

1235
01:53:36.435 --> 01:53:37.811
No, we haven't.

1236
01:53:38.812 --> 01:53:40.022
Through these mountains,
somewhere,

1237
01:53:40.314 --> 01:53:41.648
there's a green valley.

1238
01:53:42.816 --> 01:53:45.694
See these mountains over here?
There's no snow on them.

1239
01:53:47.821 --> 01:53:49.781
They must be 50 miles away.

1240
01:53:51.325 --> 01:53:53.076
You think you can walk 50 miles?

1241
01:53:53.869 --> 01:53:55.537
If we have to, we will.

1242
01:53:56.288 --> 01:53:57.706
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1243
01:53:58.707 --> 01:53:59.833
I can't.

1244
01:54:02.544 --> 01:54:04.463
I'm not as strong as you.

1245
01:54:08.592 --> 01:54:09.593
You know what it is

1246
01:54:09.885 --> 01:54:13.055
that we've lived this long,
the way we have? 70 days?

1247
01:54:13.930 --> 01:54:16.099
That we climbed this mountain?
You know what it is?

1248
01:54:17.642 --> 01:54:21.229
It's impossible.
It's impossible, and we did it.

1249
01:54:23.398 --> 01:54:24.358
I know.

1250
01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:32.240
I'm proud to be a man
on a day like this, alive!

1251
01:54:34.201 --> 01:54:35.577
That I lived to see it.

1252
01:54:37.329 --> 01:54:40.040
And see it in such a place,
take it in!

1253
01:54:43.585 --> 01:54:45.796
I love you, man! Look!

1254
01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:50.425
It's magnificent.

1255
01:54:52.928 --> 01:54:54.262
It's God.

1256
01:54:58.892 --> 01:55:02.229
It'll carry us
over every stone, I swear!

1257
01:55:04.231 --> 01:55:05.732
I swear to you.

1258
01:55:15.784 --> 01:55:19.371
All right. We'll get Tintin,
send him back to the plane.

1259
01:55:19.663 --> 01:55:20.789
We'll take his extra food.

1260
01:55:21.498 --> 01:55:24.167
You see? You see
where the sun's going to set?

1261
01:55:25.710 --> 01:55:26.878
That way's west.

1262
01:55:28.505 --> 01:55:30.799
And to the west are
the green valleys of Chile.

1263
01:55:31.341 --> 01:55:32.801
We're gonna die, you know?

1264
01:55:35.929 --> 01:55:37.305
Maybe.

1265
01:55:39.266 --> 01:55:42.602
But if we die,
we're gonna die walking.

1266
01:56:02.998 --> 01:56:04.040
Good luck!

1267
01:58:38.653 --> 01:58:40.030
Hey!

1268
01:59:30.163 --> 01:59:31.831
We're going home!

1269
02:00:03.321 --> 02:00:05.115
And so we were saved.

1270
02:00:06.282 --> 02:00:11.121
Nando and Canessa breached
the Andes and we were saved.

1271
02:00:16.626 --> 02:00:19.754
Later, a group went back
and buried the bodies.

1272
02:00:20.964 --> 02:00:24.300
They built a rough stone altar
by the grave,

1273
02:00:24.592 --> 02:00:28.096
and over it,
they placed an iron cross.

1274
02:00:31.808 --> 02:00:34.602
There's nothing more
I can tell you.

1275
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:39.107
We were brought together
by a grand experience.
