[narrator] And below the hilt,
in letters of gold,

14
00:02:59.404 --> 00:03:02.031
were written these words:

15
00:03:02.073 --> 00:03:06.161
"Whoso pulleth out this sword
of this stone and anvil

16
00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:10.123
is rightwise king
born of England."

17
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.252
Though many tried for the sword
with all their strength,

18
00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:17.255
none could move the sword, nor stir it.

19
00:03:18.173 --> 00:03:20.300
So, the miracle had networked.

20
00:03:20.341 --> 00:03:23.678
And England was still without a king.

21
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.057
And in time, the marvellous sword
was forgotten.

22
00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:36.274
This was a dark age,

23
00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.319
without law and without order.

24
00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:43.490
Men lived in fear of one another,

25
00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:46.785
for the strong preyed upon the weak.

26
00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:49.120
[wind blowing]

27
00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:53.583
[squeaking]

28
00:03:58.963 --> 00:04:02.509
[bird shrieking]

29
00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:21.069
A dark age, indeed!

30
00:04:21.111 --> 00:04:23.988
Age of inconvenience.

31
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.658
[grunting] No plumbing.

32
00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.911
[straining] No electricity.

33
00:04:29.953 --> 00:04:32.080
No nothing.

34
00:04:32.122 --> 00:04:33.581
Oh!

35
00:04:33.623 --> 00:04:36.334
Oh, hang it all!

36
00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:38.211
Hang it all.

37
00:04:38.628 --> 00:04:41.965
[muttering, coughing]

38
00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:43.716
Oh, now what? Now what?

39
00:04:43.758 --> 00:04:45.718
Leave off, leave off!

40
00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:50.056
Oh, you... you fiendish chain, you!

41
00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:54.227
Everything complicated.

42
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.980
One big medieval mess.

43
00:04:58.356 --> 00:05:00.984
[bubbling]

44
00:05:05.113 --> 00:05:09.451
[sighs] Now, let me see, um...

45
00:05:09.492 --> 00:05:12.829
He should be here in...
Uh, I'd say half an hour.

46
00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:15.039
Who? Who?

47
00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:17.292
I'd like to know who.

48
00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:20.420
I told you, Archimedes.
I am not sure.

49
00:05:20.462 --> 00:05:23.131
All I know is that someone
will be coming.

50
00:05:23.173 --> 00:05:26.634
- Someone very important.
- Oh, pin feathers.

51
00:05:26.676 --> 00:05:30.388
Fate will direct him to me
so that I in turn may guide him

52
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.724
to his rightful place in the world.

53
00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:36.102
Huh. And you say he will arrive
in half an hour?

54
00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.607
Ha. Well, we'll just see.

55
00:05:41.483 --> 00:05:43.777
And you will, Archimedes, you will.

56
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.321
Ow! [grunts]

57
00:05:47.197 --> 00:05:50.241
He'll be... a boy.

58
00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:53.328
A small boy.

59
00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:57.332
Eleven, 12 years old,

60
00:05:57.373 --> 00:06:00.418
and a scrawny little fellow.

61
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.420
[chuckles]

62
00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:05.089
Oh, no, no, no.
That can't be the one.

63
00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:08.134
Surely not. Why, that big lad
must be close on to 20.

64
00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:10.220
Ah! [chuckles]

65
00:06:10.261 --> 00:06:14.390
There he is.
The scrawny little fellow, about 12.

66
00:06:14.432 --> 00:06:17.143
He's a regular little grasshopper.

67
00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:20.396
Look at him go.

68
00:06:20.438 --> 00:06:24.442
And where, where would you guess he is
at this very moment?

69
00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:29.697
I am not guessing, Archimedes.
I know where he is!

70
00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:35.870
Uh... Less than a mile from here,
just beyond the forest.

71
00:06:35.912 --> 00:06:38.289
And right on schedule.

72
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.291
If all goes well.

73
00:06:41.543 --> 00:06:43.670
Quiet, Wart.

74
00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:45.338
I'm trying to be.

75
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.342
And nobody asked you to come along
in the first place.

76
00:06:49.384 --> 00:06:52.345
- I'm not even moving.
- Shut up.

77
00:06:53.638 --> 00:06:55.348
Aha.

78
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.519
Here we go. Oh, what a set-up.

79
00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:04.065
Hmm. Right smack
through the old gizzard.

80
00:07:07.068 --> 00:07:09.696
Wha...? Wait. Whoa!

81
00:07:10.321 --> 00:07:13.199
[older boy] Why, you clumsy little fool!

82
00:07:13.241 --> 00:07:16.202
Oh, Kay, please, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help it.

83
00:07:16.244 --> 00:07:17.704
Please.

84
00:07:17.745 --> 00:07:20.206
If I ever... [grunts]

85
00:07:20.248 --> 00:07:24.669
If I ever get my hands on you
I'll wring your scrawny little neck,

86
00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:26.254
so help me, I will.

87
00:07:26.296 --> 00:07:29.007
I'll get the arrow, Kay.
I'm sure I can find it.

88
00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:33.136
[scoffs, chuckles]

89
00:07:33.178 --> 00:07:36.181
Don't tell me you're going in there.

90
00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:39.809
- Why, it's swarming with wolves.
- I'm not afraid.

91
00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:44.981
[Kay] Well, go ahead.
It's your skin, not mine.

92
00:07:45.023 --> 00:07:46.775
Go on, go on.

93
00:07:57.368 --> 00:07:58.745
[grunts]

94
00:08:07.796 --> 00:08:09.047
[grunts]

95
00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:18.473
There it is. Oh, there it is!

96
00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:48.128
- [cracking]
- Wha...? Wait. Whoa!

97
00:08:49.087 --> 00:08:50.588
[thud]

98
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.465
[coughing]

99
00:08:52.507 --> 00:08:54.092
Well.

100
00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:57.387
So, you did drop in for tea, after all.

101
00:08:59.264 --> 00:09:02.058
Oh. You are a bit late, you know.

102
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.144
Oh, I am?

103
00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:09.774
- Yes. Now, my name is Merlin.
- [bubbling, sputtering]

104
00:09:09.858 --> 00:09:11.734
Come, come. Who are you, my lad?

105
00:09:11.776 --> 00:09:14.863
Oh, my name's Arthur,
but everyone calls me Wart.

106
00:09:14.904 --> 00:09:16.573
Oh.

107
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.577
- Oh, what a perfect stuffed owl.
- [stammering]

108
00:09:20.618 --> 00:09:23.329
Stuffed? I beg your pardon!

109
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:25.999
[Arthur] He's alive, and he talks!

110
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.127
And certainly a great deal better
than you do.

111
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.547
Oh, come, Archimedes.

112
00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:36.009
Come, come, now.
I want you to meet the Wart.

113
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.095
Now, you must forgive him.
He's only a boy.

114
00:09:39.137 --> 00:09:41.514
Boy? Boy.

115
00:09:41.556 --> 00:09:43.600
I see no boy.

116
00:09:44.893 --> 00:09:47.645
- I'm sorry that I...
- That's all right.

117
00:09:48.646 --> 00:09:52.066
- He's much too sensitive.
- Sensitive? Huh?

118
00:09:52.108 --> 00:09:54.569
- Who? What, what?
- Oh.

119
00:09:54.611 --> 00:09:58.156
- How did you know that I was...?
- That you'd be dropping in?

120
00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:01.576
Well, I happen to be a wizard.

121
00:10:01.618 --> 00:10:04.621
A soothsayer, a prognosticator.

122
00:10:04.662 --> 00:10:07.791
I have the power to see into the future.

123
00:10:07.832 --> 00:10:11.753
Centuries into the future.

124
00:10:11.795 --> 00:10:16.216
I've even been there, lad,
and I've seen all these things.

125
00:10:16.257 --> 00:10:20.512
They're only plans and small models,
of course.

126
00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:25.517
Now, this for instance
is a steam locomotive.

127
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:29.229
[steam hissing]

128
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.731
- [chugging]
- [Merlin chuckles]

129
00:10:31.773 --> 00:10:33.691
There she goes.

130
00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:35.110
Pretty good, eh?

131
00:10:40.448 --> 00:10:43.368
That won't be invented
for hundreds of years.

132
00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:46.871
Oh. You mean you can see everything
before it happens?

133
00:10:46.913 --> 00:10:48.957
Yes, everything.

134
00:10:48.998 --> 00:10:50.333
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

135
00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:51.626
Everything, Merlin?

136
00:10:51.668 --> 00:10:53.419
Uh...

137
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:55.755
No, no, not everything.

138
00:10:55.797 --> 00:10:59.926
I... I admit I didn't know whom
to expect for tea.

139
00:10:59.968 --> 00:11:02.262
But as you can see,

140
00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:06.141
I figured the exact place.

141
00:11:06.182 --> 00:11:08.643
You're very clever, sir.

142
00:11:08.685 --> 00:11:11.646
Yes. Well, never mind the "sir".

143
00:11:11.688 --> 00:11:14.232
Just plain Merlin will do.

144
00:11:15.024 --> 00:11:18.611
- Now, would you care for sugar?
- Oh, yes, I would.

145
00:11:18.695 --> 00:11:20.530
- Please.
- All right.

146
00:11:20.572 --> 00:11:22.282
Sugar? Sugar!

147
00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:30.039
No. Manners, manners.
Guests first. You know that!

148
00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:35.670
All right. Just say when, lad.

149
00:11:35.712 --> 00:11:37.755
When.

150
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.134
- Have you had any schooling?
- Oh, yes.

151
00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:44.387
I'm training to be a squire.

152
00:11:44.429 --> 00:11:47.474
I'm learning the rules of combat
and swordsmanship

153
00:11:47.515 --> 00:11:49.392
and jousting and horsemanship.

154
00:11:49.434 --> 00:11:52.771
Oh, yes, yes. Very good. That...

155
00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:57.192
No, no, no! I...
I mean a real education.

156
00:11:57.233 --> 00:12:01.613
Mathematics, history,
biology, natural science,

157
00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:04.407
English, Latin, French.

158
00:12:04.449 --> 00:12:07.952
No. When, when!
Blast it all. When!

[grumbling]

160
00:12:16.461 --> 00:12:19.798
Boy, now, you can't...

161
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.056
You can't grow up
without a decent education, you know.

162
00:12:28.098 --> 00:12:30.767
Oh, I suppose not, sir... Merlin.

163
00:12:30.809 --> 00:12:34.395
So, I am going to be your tutor.

164
00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:36.689
But I've got to get back to the castle.

165
00:12:36.773 --> 00:12:40.443
- They'll want me in the kitchen.
- Oh. Well, then, very well.

166
00:12:40.485 --> 00:12:44.072
We'll pack and be on our way.

That poor old tea set

Let's start...

- What a way to pack.

194
00:14:28.426 --> 00:14:31.262
Well... Now, just a minute, boy.

195
00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:35.725
How else would you get all this stuff
into one suitcase, I'd like to know.

196
00:14:35.767 --> 00:14:39.896
- [Arthur] But I think it's wonderful.
- Oh. Yes, it is, rather.

197
00:14:41.731 --> 00:14:47.612
Now, don't you get any foolish ideas
that magic will solve all your problems.

198
00:14:47.654 --> 00:14:49.322
Because it won't!

199
00:14:49.364 --> 00:14:51.574
But sir, I don't have any problems.

200
00:14:51.616 --> 00:14:55.703
Oh, everybody's got problems.
The world is full of problems.

201
00:14:57.789 --> 00:15:00.583
Oh, blast it all.
There, now you see what I did?

Do you want to be all muscle
and no brain?

207
00:15:19.894 --> 00:15:22.188
- I don't have any muscle.
- You don't?

208
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.525
- Well, how do you move about?
- I suppose I do have a little.

209
00:15:25.567 --> 00:15:27.861
Aha! There, you see?
Well, that's enough.

210
00:15:27.902 --> 00:15:31.739
Now, develop your brain. Knowledge,
wisdom, there's the real power.

211
00:15:31.823 --> 00:15:34.868
Higher learning, that's the thing.

[whimpering]

213
00:15:37.495 --> 00:15:40.874
First thing tomorrow morning
we'll start a full schedule.

214
00:15:40.915 --> 00:15:42.167
Eight hours a day.

215
00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:46.254
We'll have six hours for school room
and two for study period.

216
00:15:46.296 --> 00:15:47.964
But I al...

217
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.593
But I don't have the time.
I have page duties.

218
00:15:51.634 --> 00:15:53.845
Page duties? Ha!

[gurgling, thud]

221
00:15:58.141 --> 00:16:01.478
We'll change all that.
There's got to be a shake-up.

222
00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:05.356
Well, yes, sir. I suppose so.

223
00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:09.360
[Merlin] How do you expect to amount
to anything without an education?

224
00:16:09.402 --> 00:16:12.614
Even in these bungling,
backward medieval times

225
00:16:12.655 --> 00:16:16.367
you have got to know
where you're going, don't you?

226
00:16:16.409 --> 00:16:18.953
[Arthur] Yes, sir.

227
00:16:18.995 --> 00:16:20.872
[Merlin] Yes, of course.

228
00:16:20.914 --> 00:16:25.043
You must plan for the future, boy.
You've got to find a direction.

229
00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:28.838
And you've got... [stammering]

230
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.217
Now, by the by, what direction
is this castle of yours?

231
00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:35.845
- I think it's north. The other way.
- Oh.

232
00:16:35.887 --> 00:16:38.473
[grumbling]

233
00:16:38.515 --> 00:16:42.227
All right. We'd better get a move on.
Come on, lad. Pick up the pace.

[man] Oh, the devil take it.

240
00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:16.761
The devil take it.
Anyone's got better sense

241
00:17:16.803 --> 00:17:20.515
than to go barging off
in that infernal forest alone.

242
00:17:20.557 --> 00:17:23.184
You had no business letting him go.

243
00:17:23.226 --> 00:17:25.228
Look, Dad,

244
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.899
- I'm not the Wart's keeper.
- [man] Well, blast it all, I am!

245
00:17:29.983 --> 00:17:34.404
After all, I took him in,
adopted the lad, you might say.

246
00:17:34.446 --> 00:17:37.198
Being his foster father,
I'm responsible.

247

[grunts, laughing]

249
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.541
[man] Tiger, Talbert, off with you.

250
00:17:47.375 --> 00:17:50.879
Look here. What's the big idea
of gallivanting off in the woods

251
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.632
- and worrying everybody?
- I'm sorry, sir.

252
00:17:54.674 --> 00:17:56.259
Well, sorry's not enough.

253
00:17:56.301 --> 00:18:00.221
That's four demerits,
four hours extra kitchen duty.

254
00:18:01.181 --> 00:18:03.975
- Report to the cook.
- But I'd like you to meet...

255
00:18:04.017 --> 00:18:06.811
Go on, hop it, boy.
Hop, hop, hop it.

256
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.523
You've got to keep a schedule
to run a place like this.

257
00:18:10.565 --> 00:18:14.569
You need strict rules,
especially for small boys.

258
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:17.781
And I most certainly agree.

259
00:18:17.822 --> 00:18:19.991
Who are you, and... Oh...

260
00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:23.578
- I mean, you?
- My name is Merlin.

261
00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.916
And this is Archimedes,
the highly-educated owl.

262
00:18:27.957 --> 00:18:29.209
[clears throat]

263
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.587
[man laughing] Educated owl?

264
00:18:32.629 --> 00:18:34.672
Say, that's a good one.

265
00:18:34.714 --> 00:18:37.717
Say, say, I know.

266
00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:40.553
You've got him under a spell, Marvin.

267
00:18:40.595 --> 00:18:45.016
- You're a magician.
- The name is Merlin.

268
00:18:46.017 --> 00:18:50.814
And I happen to be
the world's most powerful wizard.

269
00:18:52.107 --> 00:18:54.150
Come off it, man.

270
00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:58.988
- Gadzooks.
- All right. I shall demonstrate.

271
00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.033
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mo,

272
00:19:02.075 --> 00:19:05.537

[shivers]

274
00:19:07.372 --> 00:19:09.332
What the devil are you up to?

275
00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:14.337
That is what I call a "wizard blizzard".

276
00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:17.799
Hey, Kay, would you look at this?

277
00:19:17.841 --> 00:19:19.759
An indoor blizzard.

278
00:19:19.801 --> 00:19:21.928
And in the month of July.

279
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.096
So what?

280
00:19:23.138 --> 00:19:26.724
[stammering] All right, Marvin,
turn her off.

281
00:19:26.808 --> 00:19:29.853
[shivers] I'm convinced.

282
00:19:29.894 --> 00:19:32.355
Alakazam.

283
00:19:34.232 --> 00:19:39.195
I hope you don't go in
for any of that black magic.

284
00:19:39.237 --> 00:19:41.281
Oh, no, no, no, no.

285
00:19:41.322 --> 00:19:43.616
Never touch the stuff.

286
00:19:43.658 --> 00:19:48.246
My magic is used mainly
for educational purposes.

287
00:19:50.373 --> 00:19:52.584
In fact, that is why I am here.

288
00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:55.879
I have come to educate the Wart.

289
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.089
Oh, no, you don't.

290
00:19:58.131 --> 00:19:59.674
I'm running this place.

291
00:19:59.716 --> 00:20:02.552
If you think you're gonna
fiddle with my schedule,

292
00:20:02.594 --> 00:20:05.180
pack up your bag of tricks
and be gone.

293
00:20:06.931 --> 00:20:10.935
Well, by Jove. Hey, he's gone.

294
00:20:12.353 --> 00:20:13.646
Good riddance.

295
00:20:13.688 --> 00:20:17.609
[Merlin] I'm gone,
but then I'm not gone.

296
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:23.531
[Snickers] So, if I do leave
you can never be sure that I am gone.

297
00:20:23.573 --> 00:20:25.867
- Can you?
- Well...

298
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.077
[chuckles nervously]

299
00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:31.456
Well, I must say,
you've got me there, Marvin.

300
00:20:33.124 --> 00:20:37.253
Where are you?
And you're welcome to stay, if you like.

301
00:20:37.295 --> 00:20:40.048
Thank you. You're very kind.

302
00:20:40.089 --> 00:20:43.009
Very generous, I must say.

303
00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:47.138
Well, all we can offer
is room and board.

304
00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.390
Hard times, you know, Marvin.

305
00:20:49.432 --> 00:20:53.728
We'll put you up in the northwest tower.
That's the guest room.

306
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.773
It's draughty in the winter,
but in this hot weather

307
00:20:56.815 --> 00:20:58.858
it's the best room in the house.

308
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.070
Oh, yes. Very lovely, indeed.

309
00:21:02.112 --> 00:21:05.406
So just make yourself at home, Marvin.

310
00:21:05.448 --> 00:21:08.493
Marvin?! Marvin, Marvin, Marvin.

311
00:21:14.707 --> 00:21:17.877
[thunderclap]

312
00:21:25.093 --> 00:21:27.470
Best room in the house!

313
00:21:28.221 --> 00:21:32.016
Guest room.
Unwelcome guest room!

314
00:21:32.058 --> 00:21:36.479
If he thinks that he can get rid of me,
I've got news for that old walrus.

315
00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:38.440
I'm sticking it out!

316
00:21:38.481 --> 00:21:41.776
And I say we go back to the woods.

317
00:21:41.818 --> 00:21:44.279
No, not on your life.

318
00:21:44.362 --> 00:21:47.699
That boy's got to have an education.
He has a future.

319
00:21:49.117 --> 00:21:50.410
You may be right.

320
00:21:50.452 --> 00:21:54.247
A skinny kid like that would make
a cracking good chimney sweep.

321
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:56.916
[laughing]

322
00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:58.877
- [coughing]
- [laughs]

323
00:21:58.918 --> 00:22:03.673
Something tells me
that you're all wet, Archimedes.

324
00:22:03.715 --> 00:22:05.884
[horn blowing]

325
00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:10.054

[blowing horn]

327
00:22:12.599 --> 00:22:14.809
- Who goes there?
- [man] Pellinore.

328
00:22:14.893 --> 00:22:17.854
It's Pellinore, dash it all.

329
00:22:17.896 --> 00:22:22.192
I've got big news from London.
Big news.

330
00:22:22.233 --> 00:22:25.445
Come on, man. Drop the bridge.

331
00:22:25.487 --> 00:22:29.324
[creaking, clattering]

332
00:22:29.407 --> 00:22:33.244
- [rumbling]

333
00:22:35.163 --> 00:22:38.249
Well... Big news, eh?

334
00:22:39.125 --> 00:22:41.544
Well, can't wait
for the London Times.

335
00:22:41.586 --> 00:22:45.924
First edition won't be out
for at least, uh... 12 hundred years.

336
00:22:45.965 --> 00:22:49.761
Archimedes, would you mind
sailing down there and...?

337
00:22:49.803 --> 00:22:51.971
Not interested.

338
00:22:52.013 --> 00:22:55.767
Oh, come, come, come, come now.
You're as wet as you can get.

339
00:22:55.809 --> 00:22:58.770
No. No, no, no.

340
00:22:59.354 --> 00:23:03.108
Archimedes, I'll turn you into a human.

341
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:06.736
- Hm. You wouldn't dare.
- I will. So help me, I will.

342
00:23:06.778 --> 00:23:09.489
All right. All right. All right!

343
00:23:09.531 --> 00:23:11.032
All right.

344
00:23:11.074 --> 00:23:13.451
Works every time.

345
00:23:13.493 --> 00:23:15.578
Just like magic.

346
00:23:22.919 --> 00:23:24.796
[creaking]

347
00:23:26.923 --> 00:23:30.176
Pellinore! [laughing]

348
00:23:30.218 --> 00:23:34.431
Pellinore. Greetings, old boy.

349
00:23:34.472 --> 00:23:36.766
What's all the noise about London?

350
00:23:36.808 --> 00:23:40.228
Big news, really big news.

351
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.981
Sit down, man,
and let's hear all about it.

352
00:23:43.022 --> 00:23:46.818
They're having a big tournament
New Year's Day.

353
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.529
Oh, that's not news, dash it all.

354
00:23:49.571 --> 00:23:52.198
- They always do.
- But Ector, Ector,

355
00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.952
here's where
all the excitement comes in.

356
00:23:55.994 --> 00:24:00.498
To the winner of this tournament
goes the crown.

357
00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.251
[gasping coughing]

358
00:24:03.293 --> 00:24:06.713
You mean...
You mean he'll be king of all England?

359
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:10.633
King of all England.

360
00:24:11.885 --> 00:24:13.845
Kay, lad, did you hear that?

361
00:24:13.887 --> 00:24:16.514
Pretty fair prize, I'd say.

362
00:24:16.556 --> 00:24:20.643
Yes, and you could win it, boy,
if you'd knuckle down to your training.

363
00:24:20.685 --> 00:24:24.522
We'll have you knighted by Christmas,
off to London. What do you say?

364
00:24:24.564 --> 00:24:27.525
Sure. Why not? Why not?

365
00:24:27.567 --> 00:24:30.737
Wart, lad, how'd you like
to go to London?

366
00:24:30.779 --> 00:24:32.363
Oh, Sir Ector, you mean it?

367
00:24:32.405 --> 00:24:35.241
If you stick to your duties
you can be Kay's squire.

368
00:24:35.283 --> 00:24:37.327
Oh, I Will, sir, I Will.

369
00:24:38.578 --> 00:24:40.872
[both laughing]

370
00:24:40.914 --> 00:24:43.917
I don't want the Wart for my squire.

371
00:24:44.542 --> 00:24:48.004
Here's to London, and here's to Kay.

372
00:24:48.046 --> 00:24:51.549
And here's to the banner
of the castle of the Forest Sauvage!

373
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.219
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

374
00:25:06.815 --> 00:25:09.609
[rooster crows]

375
00:25:11.402 --> 00:25:14.114
Charge!

376
00:25:14.155 --> 00:25:17.117
Wait, boy. Lean into it.

377
00:25:17.158 --> 00:25:20.662
Steady, boy, steady.
Steady with the lance.

378
00:25:20.703 --> 00:25:24.040
Do it, white knight!
Hit him clean.

379
00:25:24.874 --> 00:25:27.544
No. No, no!

380
00:25:27.919 --> 00:25:30.755
- [crash]
- [rumbling]

381
00:25:30.797 --> 00:25:33.091
[Ector] Heads up!

382
00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:39.139
[stammering] Archimedes?

383
00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.599
Archimedes, where are we?

384
00:25:41.641 --> 00:25:43.935
In a tumbled-down old tower

385
00:25:44.018 --> 00:25:48.273
in the most miserable old castle
in all Christendom, that's where.

386
00:25:48.314 --> 00:25:51.025
Uh, C... Castle? Castle?

387
00:25:51.067 --> 00:25:53.278
Don't you even remember the boy?

388
00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:55.238
Uh... The boy?

389
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.032
[Ector] Can't you remember
one blasted thing?

390
00:25:58.074 --> 00:25:59.951
Oh, now, just a moment. I...

391
00:25:59.993 --> 00:26:02.620
- [Ector] Tight grip on the lance.
- Oh.

392
00:26:02.662 --> 00:26:05.623
Loose in the saddle, knees in tight,

393
00:26:05.665 --> 00:26:08.668
weight forward and stay on target.

394
00:26:11.087 --> 00:26:13.465
You keep losing your grip.

395
00:26:13.506 --> 00:26:16.509
It's not a mere matter of muscle, son.

396
00:26:16.551 --> 00:26:19.637
Jousting is a fine skill.

397
00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:22.849
It... It's a highly developed science.

398
00:26:24.142 --> 00:26:25.852
Science, indeed.

399
00:26:25.894 --> 00:26:29.981
One dummy trying to knock off
another dummy with a bit of a stick.

400
00:26:30.023 --> 00:26:33.318
And the Wart's just as hot for it
as the rest of them.

401
00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:36.946
He certainly is.
That boy's got real spark.

402
00:26:36.988 --> 00:26:38.323
Lots of spirit.

403
00:26:38.364 --> 00:26:41.868
Throws himself heart and soul
into everything he does.

404
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.748
That's really worth something if it can
be turned in the right direction.

405
00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.333
Fat chance of that.

406
00:26:48.374 --> 00:26:52.545
Oh, I plan to cheat, of course.

407
00:26:52.587 --> 00:26:53.963
Use magic.

408
00:26:54.005 --> 00:26:57.509
Every last trick in the trade
if I have to.

409
00:27:08.061 --> 00:27:11.648
I'd give anything to go riding about
on a great white charger,

410
00:27:11.689 --> 00:27:15.693
slaying dragons and griffins
and man-eating giants.

411
00:27:16.361 --> 00:27:20.198
- Well, won't you?
- Oh, no.

412
00:27:20.281 --> 00:27:24.035
You see, I'm an orphan
and a knight must be of proper birth.

413
00:27:24.077 --> 00:27:27.163
I only hope I'm worthy
to be Kay's squire.

414
00:27:27.205 --> 00:27:29.749
That's a big job too, you know.

415
00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:31.626
Oh, indeed. Yes, yes.

416
00:27:31.668 --> 00:27:34.879
I would say almost impossible.

417
00:27:34.921 --> 00:27:39.426
Yes. Well, now then,
when I said I could swim like a fish,

418
00:27:39.467 --> 00:27:41.761
I really meant as a fish.

419
00:27:41.803 --> 00:27:45.557
You mean you can turn yourself
into a fish?

420
00:27:45.598 --> 00:27:48.726
After all, I happen to be a wizard.

421
00:27:48.768 --> 00:27:50.395
Could you turn me into a fish?

422
00:27:50.437 --> 00:27:54.732
Do you have any imagination?
Can you imagine yourself as a fish?

423
00:27:54.774 --> 00:27:56.526
Oh, that's easy.

424
00:27:56.568 --> 00:27:59.446
- I've done that lots of times.
- Oh.

425
00:27:59.487 --> 00:28:02.991
Well, good. Then I think that my magic
can do the rest.

426
00:28:03.032 --> 00:28:06.953
Uh... [stammering]

427
00:28:06.995 --> 00:28:09.456
Archimedes, what is that fish formula?

428
00:28:09.539 --> 00:28:13.084
[yawning, stammering]

429
00:28:13.126 --> 00:28:15.128
Who? Who? What?

430
00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:17.630
You know, that Latin business.

431
00:28:17.672 --> 00:28:21.593
Fish? Latin? Oh, uh...

432
00:28:21.634 --> 00:28:25.597
Aquarius, aquaticus, aqualitus.

433
00:28:25.638 --> 00:28:30.852
And now, if you don't mind,
I say good day to the both of you.

434
00:28:30.894 --> 00:28:32.395
If you please.

435
00:28:32.437 --> 00:28:37.150
When he stays out all night
he's always grumpy the next morning.

436
00:28:37.984 --> 00:28:40.904
- He must stay out every night.
- Yes, yes.

437
00:28:40.945 --> 00:28:44.699
Oh, yes.
Oh, I say, that's very good, boy.

438
00:28:45.867 --> 00:28:48.161
Who? What, what?

439
00:28:48.244 --> 00:28:51.039
All right, boy.
All set. Here we go.

440
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.125
Aquarius, aquaticus, aqualitus quom

441
00:28:54.167 --> 00:28:56.461
Aquadigitarium.

442
00:28:59.297 --> 00:29:00.548
[poof]

443
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.051
[Arthur] Merlin, am I a fish?
Am I a fish?

444
00:29:03.134 --> 00:29:05.845
Yes, yes, yes, you are a fish.

445
00:29:05.887 --> 00:29:08.556
If you don't stop
flipping and flopping around

446
00:29:08.598 --> 00:29:11.351
and get in the water
you won't last long.

447
00:29:11.601 --> 00:29:12.936
[grunts]

448
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:19.109
Now, stay right here in the tules
and I'll be with you in a minute.

449
00:29:33.832 --> 00:29:35.750
[Merlin chuckles]

450
00:29:35.792 --> 00:29:39.379
So, you thought you could take right off
like a shot, did you?

451
00:29:43.883 --> 00:29:45.927
Well, I am a fish, aren't I?

452
00:29:47.178 --> 00:29:51.599
[Merlin] You merely look like a fish.
That doesn't mean you can swim like one.

453
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:54.018
You don't have the instinct.

454
00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:58.481
So, you'll have to use your brain
for a change.

455
00:29:58.523 --> 00:30:01.067
You are living between two planes now,

456
00:30:01.109 --> 00:30:04.779
somewhere between the ceiling
and the floor.

457
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:12.495
Now, there are lots of ups and downs,
like a helicopter.

458
00:30:13.371 --> 00:30:15.331
- Helicopter?
- Yes.

459
00:30:15.415 --> 00:30:18.334
It... it... No, never mind.

460
00:30:19.169 --> 00:30:22.630
Every flick of a fin creates movement.

461
00:30:23.506 --> 00:30:26.593
So, first we'll start
with the caudal fin.

462
00:30:28.678 --> 00:30:30.847
No, no, boy. Your tail, tail.

463
00:30:35.935 --> 00:30:40.190
Now, that gives you the forward thrust.

What's wrong with that?
After all, boy, you are a fish.

483
00:31:33.618 --> 00:31:35.537
Instincts, you know.

484
00:31:35.578 --> 00:31:37.705
But you said I had no instinct.

Yes. Oh.

00:31:39.415 --> 00:31:42.252

Oh, here, here, here, here,

without that.

The water world has its forests

[Merlin] Now, first of all, lad,

814
00:53:42.655 --> 00:53:46.117
we've got to get all of these
medieval ideas out of your head.

815
00:53:46.159 --> 00:53:49.079
Clear the way for new ideas.

816
00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:54.250
Knowledge of man's fabulous discoveries
in the centuries ahead.

817
00:53:54.334 --> 00:53:56.544
Now, that will be a great advantage.

818
00:53:56.628 --> 00:53:58.546
Advantage, indeed!

819
00:53:58.588 --> 00:54:02.592
If the boy says the world is round
they'll take him for a lunatic.

820
00:54:02.634 --> 00:54:05.637
- The world is round?
- Yes, yes, that's right.

821
00:54:05.678 --> 00:54:09.182
And it also goes around.

822
00:54:12.102 --> 00:54:15.939
- You mean, it'll be round someday?
- No, no, no. It's round now.

823
00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:18.858
Man will discover this
in centuries to come.

824
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:20.527
And he will also find

825
00:54:20.568 --> 00:54:25.782
that the world is merely a tiny speck
in the universe.

826
00:54:25.824 --> 00:54:29.035
- Universe?
- Ah. You're only confusing the boy.

827
00:54:29.077 --> 00:54:33.164
He'll be so mixed up he'll...
he'll be wearing his shoes on his head.

828
00:54:33.206 --> 00:54:35.333
Man has always learned from the past.

829
00:54:35.375 --> 00:54:38.211
After all, you can't learn history
in reverse.

830
00:54:38.253 --> 00:54:41.005
It's confusing enough,
for heaven's sakes.

831
00:54:41.047 --> 00:54:43.800
- All right. All right.
- [coughing]

832
00:54:43.842 --> 00:54:47.220
Have it your way, Archimedes.
You're in charge.

833
00:54:47.262 --> 00:54:49.139
You're the headmaster now.

834
00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:51.808
So, from now on he's your pupil.

835
00:54:53.351 --> 00:54:56.688
So, from now on, boy,

836
00:54:56.729 --> 00:54:58.481
you do as I say.

837
00:54:58.523 --> 00:55:00.358
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

838
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:04.612
Now, to start off,
I want you to read these books.

839
00:55:05.155 --> 00:55:06.406
All of them?

840
00:55:06.448 --> 00:55:09.868
That, my boy,
is a mountain of knowledge.

841
00:55:09.909 --> 00:55:12.662
- But I can't read.
- What, what? What!

842
00:55:12.704 --> 00:55:15.874
- I don't suppose you know how to write?
- No, sir.

843
00:55:15.915 --> 00:55:18.710
- Well, what do you know?
- Well, I...

844
00:55:18.752 --> 00:55:22.714
Never mind, never mind.
We'll start at the bottom. The ABC's.

845
00:55:23.757 --> 00:55:27.594
First the A and now the B.

846
00:55:27.677 --> 00:55:31.389
Loop and around and there's the C.

847
00:55:31.431 --> 00:55:34.517
Merlin, look. I can write!

848
00:55:34.559 --> 00:55:37.145
Oh, yes, yes.
That's very good, boy.

849
00:55:37.187 --> 00:55:39.397
Hen scratch, that's all.
Hen scratch.

850
00:55:39.481 --> 00:55:42.817
Now, come on. D, E, F.

851
00:55:42.859 --> 00:55:45.153
And now the G.

852
00:55:45.195 --> 00:55:48.907
You see, it's as simple as...
No, no, no, no, boy!

853
00:55:48.948 --> 00:55:53.203
Use your head, use your head, will you?
How do you expect to learn anything?

854
00:55:53.203 --> 00:55:54.412
Archimedes.

855
00:55:54.454 --> 00:55:59.793
Have you seen that flying machine model?

856
00:55:59.834 --> 00:56:03.671
I have nothing to do with your
futuristic fiddle-faddle, you know that.

857
00:56:03.755 --> 00:56:06.674
- What's that thing up there?
- Hmm?

858
00:56:06.716 --> 00:56:09.719
Oh, yes, of course. Here we are.

859
00:56:09.761 --> 00:56:12.639
Do you mean man will fly
in one of those someday?

860
00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.601
If man were meant to fly,
he'd have been born with wings.

861
00:56:17.352 --> 00:56:22.482
I am about to prove otherwise,
Archimedes, if you care to watch.

862
00:56:23.316 --> 00:56:25.360
Here she goes!

863
00:56:26.736 --> 00:56:29.280
No, no, no!

864
00:56:31.366 --> 00:56:33.493
Man will fly, all right.

865
00:56:34.327 --> 00:56:36.121
Just like a rock.

866
00:56:36.162 --> 00:56:38.623
[Archimedes laughing]

867
00:56:38.706 --> 00:56:43.586
It would have worked if...
if it weren't for this infernal beard.

868
00:56:54.806 --> 00:56:56.516
I never...

869
00:56:56.558 --> 00:56:59.727
Never in my whole...

870
00:57:04.732 --> 00:57:08.319
Man will fly someday, I tell you.

871
00:57:08.403 --> 00:57:11.281
I have been there.
I have seen it.

872
00:57:11.322 --> 00:57:15.702
Oh, I do hope so.
I've always dreamed about flying.

873
00:57:15.744 --> 00:57:19.581
That I was a bird and that
I could go sailing all over the sky,

874
00:57:19.622 --> 00:57:21.541
high above everything.

875
00:57:21.583 --> 00:57:24.794
Avis alitus avita atheta.
Prestidigitonium.

876
00:57:24.836 --> 00:57:27.130
It's my favourite dream.

877
00:57:27.172 --> 00:57:30.717
Oh, but then, I suppose
everybody dreams about flying.

878
00:57:31.885 --> 00:57:34.345
I'm a bird, I'm a bird,
I'm a bird!

879
00:57:34.429 --> 00:57:37.724
Hold it, boy.
Not so fast, not so fast.

880
00:57:37.766 --> 00:57:41.895
First, I'd better explain the mechanics
of a bird's wing.

881
00:57:41.936 --> 00:57:45.482
Now, these large feathers

882
00:57:45.523 --> 00:57:48.943
are called the primaries, and...

883
00:57:48.985 --> 00:57:53.740
And since when do you know
all about birds' wings?

884
00:57:53.782 --> 00:57:57.619
I have made an extensive study
of birds in flight and I...

885
00:57:57.702 --> 00:58:01.748
And if you don't mind,
I happen to be a bird.

886
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:05.960
All right, Mr Know-it-All!
He's your pupil.

887
00:58:06.002 --> 00:58:07.295
Ouch.

888
00:58:07.337 --> 00:58:12.467
Now, boy, flying is not merely
some crude mechanical process.

889
00:58:12.509 --> 00:58:14.636
[clearing throat]

890
00:58:14.677 --> 00:58:18.515
It is a delicate art,
purely aesthetic,

891
00:58:18.556 --> 00:58:20.475
poetry of motion.

892
00:58:20.517 --> 00:58:22.811
And the best way to learn it
is to do it.

893
00:58:22.894 --> 00:58:26.731
Now, since we're pretty far up,
we'll start with a glide.

894
00:58:26.815 --> 00:58:30.151
Spread your wings way out.
Way out!

895
00:58:30.193 --> 00:58:31.528
That's it, that's it.

896
00:58:31.569 --> 00:58:33.780
Now, fan your tail.

897
00:58:33.822 --> 00:58:37.742
Tippety toe, tippety toe
and off we go.

898
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:43.081
Now, tuck your feet under like me.

899
00:58:43.123 --> 00:58:46.042
That's it. That's the idea.

900
00:58:47.419 --> 00:58:48.795
Whoa. What?

901
00:58:48.837 --> 00:58:52.215
And don't fight the air currents.
Use them.

902
00:59:03.643 --> 00:59:06.271
Why, say, boy!

903
00:59:06.312 --> 00:59:08.690
That's pretty good.

904
00:59:08.731 --> 00:59:11.651
Well, boy, you're a natural.

905
00:59:11.693 --> 00:59:15.238
Are you sure this is
the first time that you...

906
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.949
Wart, Wart, hawk, hawk!

907
00:59:17.991 --> 00:59:21.536
Look out, boy, heads up!
Come on, Wart!

908
00:59:22.871 --> 00:59:24.831
Archimedes, help!

909
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:29.961
[hawk screeching]

910
00:59:30.003 --> 00:59:34.048

How lovely.

916

I do hope it's serious.

917
01:00:00.992 --> 01:00:03.286
Something dreadful.

918
01:00:03.369 --> 01:00:07.540
Oh, bat gizzards. It's nothing
but a scrawny little sparrow

919

with a beak full of soot.

920
01:00:09.459 --> 01:00:12.670
Oh, I'm not really a sparrow.
I'm a boy.

921
01:00:12.712 --> 01:00:14.506
A boy?

922
01:00:14.547 --> 01:00:18.760
Merlin changed me with his magic.
He's the world's most powerful wizard.

in one little finger.

of the Marvellous Madam Mim?

01:06:11.905 --> 01:06:13.615
Merlin?

1029
01:06:13.656 --> 01:06:16.993
- No disappearing.
- [panting] Whew!

1030
01:06:18.119 --> 01:06:20.497
Oh! Oh, oh!

1031
01:06:24.167 --> 01:06:27.087
[clucking]

1032
01:06:30.757 --> 01:06:32.884
Ouch!

1033
01:06:39.682 --> 01:06:41.226
Mim? Mim?

1034
01:06:41.267 --> 01:06:44.813
Are you...?
What's going on here?

1035
01:06:44.854 --> 01:06:47.232
You... You big blimp.

1036
01:06:49.442 --> 01:06:51.986
[screams]

1037
01:06:54.531 --> 01:06:56.658
[roaring]

1038
01:06:56.699 --> 01:06:58.451
[cackles]

1039
01:06:58.493 --> 01:07:01.037
Squash me, will ya?

1040
01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:08.461
- [rattling]
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, Merlin.

1041
01:07:09.629 --> 01:07:11.339
Ouch! Ooh!

1042
01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:13.216
Bravo.

1043
01:07:15.552 --> 01:07:18.721
Just you wait, just you wait.
You're gonna pay.

1044
01:07:34.612 --> 01:07:38.032
So, you want to play rough, do you?

1045
01:07:40.201 --> 01:07:42.078
All right, Merlin.

1046
01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.707
I'll smash you good, you old crab.

1047
01:07:46.708 --> 01:07:48.543
Jehoshaphat.

1048
01:07:50.044 --> 01:07:53.882
Here I come, Mim, ready or not.

1049
01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:57.635
Merlin, you wouldn't dare.

1050
01:07:57.677 --> 01:07:59.804
Merlin!

1051
01:07:59.846 --> 01:08:02.599
[screams]

1052
01:08:09.564 --> 01:08:12.525
[gasps] Now, Mim, Mim,
no dragons, remember?

1053
01:08:12.567 --> 01:08:16.571
Did I say no purple dragons?
Did I?!

1054
01:08:26.456 --> 01:08:27.957
[cries out]

1055
01:08:27.999 --> 01:08:31.044
- [blowing]
- [laughing]

1056
01:08:31.086 --> 01:08:33.546
I win, I win!

1057
01:08:33.588 --> 01:08:37.383
Oh, that horrible old witch.
I'll peck her eyes out.

1058
01:08:37.425 --> 01:08:38.718
No, no.

1059
01:08:41.304 --> 01:08:42.555
[gasps]

1060
01:08:42.597 --> 01:08:45.141
- He's gone.
- Disappeared.

1061
01:08:45.183 --> 01:08:47.727
[Merlin] Madam, I have not disappeared.

1062
01:08:47.769 --> 01:08:49.729
I am very tiny.

1063
01:08:49.771 --> 01:08:52.899
I am a germ, a rare disease.

1064
01:08:52.941 --> 01:08:55.902
I'm called Malagalee Telopterosis.

1065
01:08:55.944 --> 01:08:58.488
And you caught me, Mim.

1066
01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:00.907
- What?!
- [laughing]

1067
01:09:00.949 --> 01:09:03.368
First, you break out into spots.

1068
01:09:06.037 --> 01:09:10.041
Followed by hot and cold flashes.

1069
01:09:10.083 --> 01:09:11.876
[shivering]

1070
01:09:11.918 --> 01:09:14.087
Then violent sneezing.

1071
01:09:14.129 --> 01:09:16.673
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...

1072
01:09:16.714 --> 01:09:18.591
Ah-choo!

1073
01:09:18.633 --> 01:09:20.218
Watch it, boy.

1074
01:09:20.343 --> 01:09:22.470
[shouts] Oh! You, you, you...

1075
01:09:22.512 --> 01:09:25.181
You sneaky old scoundrel!

1076
01:09:25.223 --> 01:09:28.893
[crying]

1077
01:09:32.063 --> 01:09:35.900
[Merlin] It's not too serious, Madam.
You should recover in a few weeks

1078
01:09:35.984 --> 01:09:39.571
and be as good...
I mean, as bad, as ever.

1079
01:09:39.654 --> 01:09:42.115
But I would suggest plenty of rest

1080
01:09:42.198 --> 01:09:46.202
and lots and lots of sunshine.

1081
01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.497
I hate sunshine.

1082
01:09:49.539 --> 01:09:53.334
I hate horrible wholesome sunshine!

1083
01:09:53.376 --> 01:09:55.462
I hate it, I hate it!

1084
01:09:55.503 --> 01:09:58.089
I hate, hate, hate...

1085
01:09:58.131 --> 01:10:02.177
You were really great, Merlin.
But you could have been killed.

1086
01:10:02.218 --> 01:10:05.430
It was worth it, lad,
if you learned something from it.

1087
01:10:06.639 --> 01:10:09.058
Knowledge and wisdom is the real power.

1088
01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:12.771
Right you are, Wart.
So, stick to your schooling, boy.

1089
01:10:12.812 --> 01:10:15.565
Oh, don't worry.
I will, sir. I will.

1090
01:10:15.607 --> 01:10:17.025
Oh, I really will.

1091
01:10:18.902 --> 01:10:22.655
[Men] I We will sing
all night and all day

1092
01:10:22.697 --> 01:10:27.786
<i>♪ We will fight for the blue oak tree
On a field of white ♪</i>

1093
01:10:27.827 --> 01:10:29.871
<i>♪ For the blue oak tree ♪</i>

1094
01:10:29.913 --> 01:10:35.335
<i>♪ On a field of white ♪</i>

1095
01:10:37.337 --> 01:10:40.757
[men laughing]

1096
01:10:40.799 --> 01:10:44.969
Here's to victory in London
for my son, Kay.

1097
01:10:45.011 --> 01:10:48.431
Sir Kay.
I've been knighted, don't forget.

1098
01:10:48.473 --> 01:10:51.684
Oh, of course, son, of course.

1099
01:10:51.726 --> 01:10:54.395
Here's to Sir Kay.

1100
01:10:54.437 --> 01:10:58.274
And who knows?
The future king of all England.

1101
01:10:58.358 --> 01:10:59.984
Watch it, will ya?

1102
01:11:00.026 --> 01:11:02.070
Kay the king?

1103
01:11:02.112 --> 01:11:04.656
What a dreadful thought.

1104
01:11:04.697 --> 01:11:08.785
Sir Ector, Sir Ector,
Hobbs has come down with the mumps.

1105
01:11:09.452 --> 01:11:13.039
He's all puffed up like a toad.

1106
01:11:13.123 --> 01:11:16.584
Then Kay will need another squire,
hang it all.

1107
01:11:16.626 --> 01:11:19.504
- Wart, you're it.
- I'm what, sir?

1108
01:11:19.546 --> 01:11:21.923
Kay's squire.
You're going to London.

1109
01:11:21.965 --> 01:11:24.676
Oh, Sir Ector!
Wha...? Wait. Whoa!

1110
01:11:28.138 --> 01:11:31.307
Merlin, Archimedes, Merlin!

1111
01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:36.771
Merlin, look! I'm a squire.

1112
01:11:36.813 --> 01:11:38.606
Ha!

1113
01:11:39.732 --> 01:11:43.069
Oh. Very nice, boy.

1114
01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.739
Yes, indeed.

1115
01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:49.701
A fine monkey suit for polishing boots.

1116
01:11:49.743 --> 01:11:51.703
It's what all squires wear.

1117
01:11:51.745 --> 01:11:55.290
And I thought you were going
to amount to something.

1118
01:11:55.331 --> 01:11:57.917
I thought you had a few brains!

1119
01:11:59.252 --> 01:12:01.921
Great future. Ha!

1120
01:12:01.963 --> 01:12:05.800
A stooge for that love you, Kay.

1121
01:12:05.842 --> 01:12:08.428
Congratulations, boy!

1122
01:12:09.262 --> 01:12:11.139
What do you want me to be?

1123
01:12:11.181 --> 01:12:13.057
I'm nobody. You...

1124
01:12:13.099 --> 01:12:16.394
You don't know a thing
about what's going on today.

1125
01:12:16.436 --> 01:12:18.730
I'm lucky to be Kay's squire.

1126
01:12:18.813 --> 01:12:22.567
Oh! Of all the idiotic...

1127
01:12:22.609 --> 01:12:24.152
[stammering] I...

1128
01:12:24.194 --> 01:12:26.404
Blow me to Bermuda!

1129
01:12:34.621 --> 01:12:38.208
- Where did he go?
- To Bermuda, I suppose.

1130
01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:41.377
- Where's that?
- Oh, an island way off somewhere

1131
01:12:41.419 --> 01:12:45.256
- that hasn't been discovered yet.
- Will he ever come back?

1132
01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:48.176
Who knows? Who knows anything?

1133
01:12:53.139 --> 01:12:56.059
[man] For the crown of all England,

1134
01:12:56.101 --> 01:12:58.645
let the tournament begin!

1135
01:12:58.686 --> 01:13:02.524
- [whinnying]
- [crowd cheering]

1136
01:13:17.372 --> 01:13:20.792
Kay! Now, it's up to the swords.

1137
01:13:20.834 --> 01:13:23.294
Swords? Swords?!

1138
01:13:23.378 --> 01:13:24.838
Oh, no!

1139
01:13:24.879 --> 01:13:27.424
- Kay.
- What? What?

1140
01:13:27.465 --> 01:13:30.927
I... I forgot your sword.

1141
01:13:30.969 --> 01:13:33.596
Forgot my sword!

1142
01:13:33.638 --> 01:13:36.474
I... I left it back at the inn.

1143
01:13:36.516 --> 01:13:40.645
Why, you bungling little fool!

1144
01:13:40.687 --> 01:13:44.190
You'd better get it,
or don't you dare come back!

1145
01:13:49.279 --> 01:13:51.072
Let me in, let me in!

1146
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:54.659
Somebody, please!
Please let me in!

1147
01:13:54.701 --> 01:13:57.829
It's no use, boy,
they've all gone to the tournament.

1148
01:13:57.871 --> 01:14:01.791
Oh, what will I do?
Kay's got to have a sword.

1149
01:14:01.833 --> 01:14:04.669
Look, boy. Look.
There in the churchyard.

1150
01:14:04.711 --> 01:14:07.881
A sword.
Oh, Archimedes. A sword!

1151
01:14:10.216 --> 01:14:13.803
[Archimedes] You're gonna have
a time pulling it out.

1152
01:14:13.887 --> 01:14:15.388
Watch it, boy.

1153
01:14:23.563 --> 01:14:25.190
Better leave it alone.

1154
01:14:25.231 --> 01:14:28.735
But Kay's got to have a sword.

1155
01:14:31.029 --> 01:14:33.698
Now, come on, quick.
Let's get out of here.

1156
01:14:36.201 --> 01:14:39.204
You're up next, son.
Better get ready.

1157
01:14:39.245 --> 01:14:41.456
[Arthur] Kay, Kay, here's a sword.

1158
01:14:42.957 --> 01:14:46.795
- This is not my sword.
- Hold on, Kay.

1159
01:14:46.878 --> 01:14:48.129
Wait a minute.

1160
01:14:48.171 --> 01:14:51.382
"Whoso pulleth out this sword..."

1161
01:14:53.051 --> 01:14:55.595
It's the sword in the stone.

1162
01:14:55.637 --> 01:14:58.681
The sword in the stone?
It can't be.

1163
01:14:58.723 --> 01:15:00.266
But look, it is.

1164
01:15:00.308 --> 01:15:03.603
- It's the marvellous sword.
- Hold everything.

1165
01:15:03.645 --> 01:15:07.398
Someone's pulled the sword
from the stone!

1166
01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:10.068
Where did you get it, Wart?

1167
01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:13.947
I pulled it out of an anvil
that was on a stone

1168
01:15:13.988 --> 01:15:16.032
in... in a churchyard.

1169
01:15:16.074 --> 01:15:19.035
[all laughing]

1170
01:15:19.077 --> 01:15:21.788
The lad's a young Samson.

1171
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:24.541
You're making a fool of us, boy.

1172
01:15:24.582 --> 01:15:27.710
- Now, tell the truth.
- But I did, sir.

1173
01:15:27.752 --> 01:15:30.797
Then come on. Prove it.
To the stone with you.

1174
01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.216
[man] Yes, prove it.

1175
01:15:33.258 --> 01:15:33.800
[man] Yes, prove it.

1176
01:15:33.842 --> 01:15:36.052
[man 2] Come on! Prove it!

1177
01:15:42.225 --> 01:15:46.146
All right, boy, let's have the miracle.

1178
01:15:51.025 --> 01:15:52.902
Now, wait a minute.

1179
01:15:52.944 --> 01:15:56.614
Anyone can pull it
once it's been pulled.

1180
01:15:58.491 --> 01:16:01.786
Go to it, Kay.
Give it all you've got.

1181
01:16:01.828 --> 01:16:05.665
- Put your back into it.
- [men clamouring]

1182
01:16:05.749 --> 01:16:08.042
- Get out.
- Push him aside.

1183
01:16:09.335 --> 01:16:13.298
- There's four. That's not fair.
- I say we let the boy try it.

1184
01:16:13.339 --> 01:16:16.760
That's what I say.
Give the boy a chance.

1185
01:16:16.801 --> 01:16:18.636
Go ahead, son.

1186
01:16:31.649 --> 01:16:35.070
It's a miracle,
ordained by heaven.

1187
01:16:35.111 --> 01:16:37.572
This boy is our king.

1188
01:16:37.614 --> 01:16:40.700
Well, by Jove.

1189
01:16:40.742 --> 01:16:43.870
- [man] What's the lad's name?
- Wart.

1190
01:16:43.912 --> 01:16:45.580
Oh, I mean, Arthur.

1191
01:16:45.622 --> 01:16:47.916
[man] Hail, King Arthur!

1192
01:16:47.957 --> 01:16:51.669
[all] Hail, King Arthur!
Long live the king!

1193
01:16:51.711 --> 01:16:54.964
[laughs] I can't believe it.

1194
01:16:55.006 --> 01:16:58.093
Oh, forgive me, son.

1195
01:16:59.344 --> 01:17:02.305
- Forgive me.
- Oh, please don't, sir.

1196
01:17:02.347 --> 01:17:05.475
Kay, bow down to your king.

1197
01:17:12.107 --> 01:17:15.193
[Narrator] So, at last,
a miracle had come to pass

1198
01:17:15.235 --> 01:17:18.279
in that far-off time
upon New Year's Day.

1199
01:17:18.321 --> 01:17:22.700
And the glorious reign
of King Arthur was begun.

1200
01:17:22.742 --> 01:17:24.369
[sighs]

1201
01:17:26.329 --> 01:17:28.289
I can't be a king, Archimedes.

1202
01:17:28.331 --> 01:17:30.917
I don't know anything
about ruling a country.

1203
01:17:30.959 --> 01:17:34.671
I told you to leave the thing
in the stone, boy.

1204
01:17:34.712 --> 01:17:37.715
I'll run away, that's what I'll do.

1205
01:17:40.885 --> 01:17:44.431
- They'll have to get somebody else.
- Better take the side door.

1206
01:17:44.472 --> 01:17:46.766
Out the side door.

1207
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:53.731
[crowd] Hail, King Arthur!
Long live the king!

1208
01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:59.571
There's another door over there.
Over there, come on. Come on.

1209
01:18:02.949 --> 01:18:05.034
[crowd] Long live King Arthur!

1210
01:18:05.076 --> 01:18:06.953
Long live...

1211
01:18:08.288 --> 01:18:10.248
Looks like we're surrounded, boy.

1212
01:18:10.290 --> 01:18:14.043
Oh, Archimedes, I wish Merlin was here.

1213
01:18:16.713 --> 01:18:19.382
Merlin! Merlin!

1214
01:18:24.137 --> 01:18:26.514
Oh, Merlin, you're back
from Ber... Ber...

1215
01:18:26.556 --> 01:18:28.391
Bermuda? Yes.

1216
01:18:28.433 --> 01:18:32.020
Back from Bermuda and the 20th century.

1217
01:18:33.104 --> 01:18:36.107
And believe me, you can have it.

1218
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:39.569
One big modern mess.

1219
01:18:39.611 --> 01:18:41.738
Alakazam.

1220
01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:46.076
- I'm in an awful pickle. I'm king.
- He pulled the sword from the stone.

1221
01:18:46.117 --> 01:18:47.744
Ha ha!

1222
01:18:47.786 --> 01:18:49.704
Of course, of course.

1223
01:18:49.746 --> 01:18:53.792
King Arthur
and his Knights of the Round Table.

1224
01:18:53.833 --> 01:18:57.545
- "Round Table"?
- Would you rather have a square one?

1225
01:18:57.587 --> 01:18:59.881
Oh, no. Round will be fine.

1226
01:18:59.923 --> 01:19:01.508
[chuckles]

1227
01:19:01.549 --> 01:19:03.718
Boy, boy, boy.

1228
01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.304
You'll become a great legend.

1229
01:19:06.346 --> 01:19:09.682
They'll be writing books about you
for centuries to come.

1230
01:19:09.766 --> 01:19:13.728
Why, they might even make
a motion picture about you.

1231
01:19:14.521 --> 01:19:17.148
- Motion picture?
- Oh.

1232
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:21.069
Well, that's something like television.

1233
01:19:22.362 --> 01:19:24.239
Without commercials.

1234
01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:32.038
