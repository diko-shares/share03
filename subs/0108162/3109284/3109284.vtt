00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.270
Hi.

3
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.930
- Good morning.
- Hello, I'm Carla Norris.

4
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.490
I have an appointment
with Mrs. McEvoy.

5
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.410
Through the garden, please, miss.
I'll tell her you're on your way there.

6
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.690
Thanks.

7
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.450
Hello, Mrs. McEvoy? Douglas.
Your 8:00 is here.

8
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.970
- Good morning.
- Miss Norris?

9
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.130
Yes.

10
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.200
- Hello, I'm Evelyn McEvoy.
- Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

11
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.050
This midtown traffic.
I swear, I'll never get used to it.

12
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.600
Shall we see the apartment?

13
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.130
Yes. Sure.

14
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.760
Central air conditioning.
Absolutely terrific kitchen.

15
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.970
- I love the view.
- Yes. It's an airy place.

16
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.560
What is it that you do, Miss Norris?

17
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.210
I'm a book editor at Sutton.

18
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.290
- What a strange tub.
- I like tubs myself.

19
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.720
This is a nice room for reading, isn't it?

20
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.120
For reading?

21
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.410
Yes, it is, isn't it?

22
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.730
I have got two tickets for Pavarotti Friday.

23
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.880
I hate Pavarotti.

24
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.530
I don't care if I ever go to an opera
for the rest of my life. Or the ballet.

25
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.050
What do you want me to do?
Meet another nice, charming man...

26
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.650
like Derek,
and wake up seven years later...

27
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.760
- and realize I have no life?
- God, Carly, please.

28
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.680
- Look, why don't you get tickets to...
- Who?

29
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.360
- Pearl Jam.
- Pearl Jam?

30
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.560
Yeah.

31
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.760
You know, you're really being a putz.

32
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.770
How am I going to meet any attractive
men if I have to do it by myself?

33
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.360
You love Pavarotti.

34
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.080
I am a putz.
I wasted seven years of my life.

35
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.440
- And I hate Pavarotti.
- Will you stop it?

36
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.090
You are ready for new adventures.

37
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.880
New horizons.
New lovers. New orgasms.

38
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.330
- Well?
- I'm 35, I'm not 25.

39
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.730
I don't need a date,
I need a relationship.

40
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.360
Preferably one
where something happens this time.

41
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.520
Sure, but in case you've forgotten
how it works...

42
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.960
first you meet somebody,
then you have a relationship.

43
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.570
Oh, thank you, Dr. Ruth.

44
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.160
Do you work here, or do you just go
from office to office, offering advice?

45
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.250
Oh, will you take a look at Chapter 6?
I think I might have cut too deep.

46
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.280
Well, you didn't show it
to the author yet, did you?

47
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.440
Yeah, I did.

48
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.570
And?

49
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.250
He said, "I'll discuss it with Carly."

50
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.250
You cut too deep.

51
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.890
Never show it to the author
before you give it to me first, okay?

52
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.720
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

53
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.850
I'm sure the cuts are good.

54
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.730
And the author's a pussycat,
so don't worry about it. This is good.

55
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.520
Where are you
with the James Dean bio?

56
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.240
Marketing wants to up
the publishing date.

57
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.130
I'll be done with it
by the end of the weekend.

58
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.400
You're a genius, Carly.

59
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.930
Sure, who wouldn't be
on your social schedule?

60
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.610
There's a Mrs. McEvoy on line 1.
She says it's important.

61
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.690
- Do you want to talk to her?
- Yeah.

62
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.720
And Mr. Parsons called. He wants
to take you to lunch at L'Adagio.

63
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.970
That means I'm not getting my raise.

64
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.890
- Mrs. McEvoy.
- Good news, my dear.

65
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.250
- Your application's been approved.
- Already?

66
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.650
- Is that a problem?
- No.

67
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.090
No, I... I just didn't think
it would happen this fast.

68
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.850
Oh, I thought you'd be pleased.

69
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.000
I am. I'm very excited. Thank you.

70
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.000
Well, then,
we can get you in next week.

71
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.840
- Next week will be fine.
- Splendid.

72
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.010
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

73
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.210
- There you go.
- Thank you.

74
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.450
Sure.

75
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.050
Sorry I couldn't get the door
for you, Miss Norris.

76
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.290
The movers will be here
in about an hour.

77
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.250
- I'll keep an eye out for you.
- Thank you.

78
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.810
He didn't want a "thank you."
I think he wanted a tip.

79
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.970
Well, he didn't get the door for me,
now, did he?

80
00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.720
Sure didn't.

81
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.290
- Can I take one of these for you?
- I'm okay.

82
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.850
Come on, I've got two free arms.

83
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.970
You want me
to take this other one for you?

84
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.000
- No, I'm okay.
- You're sure?

85
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.850
Okay.

86
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.800
I know the neighborhood
real well, so...

87
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.280
if you want the lowdown
on stores and things like that...

88
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.570
- I could...
- How's the market across the street?

89
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.560
It's okay.
The one over on 39th is cheaper.

90
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.970
Thanks.

91
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.280
I'm not gonna ask you again
if I can bring this up for you.

92
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.880
- Good. Don't.
- Here you go.

93
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.250
Thank you.

94
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.040
Welcome to 113. You'll like it here.

95
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.240
I will. Thank you.

96
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.480
You're right. These are getting heavy.

97
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.810
- Sorry. I'll see you.
- Bye.

98
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.800
I need a check okay, register 3.

99
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.370
Check okay on register 3, please.

100
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.490
You only have one thing.
Why don't you go ahead of me?

101
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.770
Oh, well, good idea. Thanks.

102
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.370
I'm Gus Hale.

103
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.200
You're moving in today, aren't you?

104
00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.880
- Well, welcome to 113.
- Thanks.

105
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.930
I'm in 23-B.

106
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.640
- I'll take that for you.
- Thank you.

107
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.840
Hey, why are you walking here?

108
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.040
Forgive me,
I don't usually follow women around.

109
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.450
I'm not a dirty old man, really not.

110
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.810
- Are you certain?
- Sometimes I wish I were, but I'm not.

111
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.120
- Why do you wish you were?
- Because it's boring when you're not.

112
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.040
You just really...
Well, you look like someone.

113
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.730
Someone you like
or someone you dislike?

114
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.840
Oh, no. I liked her a lot.

115
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.130
What's really strange is...

116
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.680
she was in 20-B as well.

117
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.770
Naomi Singer.

118
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.760
- When did she move?
- Well, she didn't. She...

119
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.760
She jumped out the window.

120
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:32.250
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
I've never had much goddamned tact.

121
00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.090
I tell you what.
I'm about to go off to Japan.

122
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.320
Perhaps when I get back,
I can fill you in on all the gossip.

123
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.840
- What are you gonna do there?
- I teach a class at NYU.

124
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.240
The Psychology of the Lens.

125
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.770
- "The Psychology of the Lens."
- Yes.

126
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.450
I teach all aspects.
I mean, cameras, camcorders...

127
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.720
I'm going over
to look at the latest technology.

128
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.770
So, you like salacious gossip?

129
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.730
I make a great cappuccino, too.

130
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.280
Call me.

131
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.720
How can I call you
when I don't even know your name?

132
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.920
How can you not know my name
if you knew my apartment number?

133
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.130
Our doormen are spoiled.
$5 only gets you half the information.

134
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.440
Carly Norris.

135
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.210
You must have liked her an awful lot
to spend $5.

136
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.480
I did.

137
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.610
We were pals.

138
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.760
- How's the market across the street?
- It's okay.

139
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.290
Welcome to 113. You'll like it here.

140
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.400
- Where do you live now?
- In the Village.

141
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.920
This will be quite a change.

142
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.680
Shall I show you
the rest of the apartment?

143
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.040
Have you grown tired of the Village?

144
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.760
Oh, I teach all aspects of it.
Cameras, camcorders...

145
00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.240
This way.

146
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.880
Now, why don't you talk
to Lynn Nesbit about him?

147
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.920
His last book didn't sell very well.
Perhaps he's getting itchy at Random.

148
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.200
Perhaps he's blaming their marketing
and not the thinness of his characters.

149
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.280
Perhaps you can convince Lynn
to alert him to the inadequacies...

150
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.000
- of their marketing department.
- Are we negotiating, Alex?

151
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.480
Oh, I wouldn't call it that.

152
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.320
He's an attractive man, isn't he?

153
00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:26.760
Alex, I ask you for a raise,
and you take me out to lunch...

154
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:27.960
and try to set me up.

155
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.000
Jack Landsford.

156
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.840
Shred of Evidence, Flesh and Blood,
police procedurals.

157
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.040
He hasn't written anything
in five or six years...

158
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.840
but he made so much off of
Flesh and Blood, he doesn't have to.

159
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.920
He's got a ranch in Montana.

160
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.840
- And speak of the devil.
- Hello, Alex.

161
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.920
- How are you?
- All right.

162
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.680
I'm the devil.

163
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.400
- Carla Norris.
- Hello.

164
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:54.080
You look familiar to me.

165
00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.080
Maybe that's because
I live in your building.

166
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.560
Oh, yeah.

167
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.960
Jack, Carly is a big fan of yours.
She just loved Flesh and Blood.

168
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.280
- Hey.
- I haven't read it.

169
00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.640
I'm sorry.

170
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.880
- Here you are, sir.
- She hasn't read me.

171
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.680
Alex, why is it she hasn't read me?

172
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:20.120
Everybody's read me. I'm easy to read.

173
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.200
Well, I haven't.

174
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.160
She has better taste than I thought.

175
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.200
She'll read me, though.

176
00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.520
What if she doesn't like
what she reads?

177
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.000
- Hi, Jack.
- You'll read me.

178
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:39.280
I know you'll read me.
Because you have good taste.

179
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.320
You've lost her now, Jack.
She likes being in control.

180
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.120
So do I.

181
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.320
- See you around the neighborhood.
- Yeah.

182
00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:54.920
Alex.

183
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.800
I spend seven years in a bad marriage,
and you say I like being in control?

184
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.360
But you ended it, didn't you?

185
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.240
No. No way.

186
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.280
No.

187
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.040
Fuck both of you. You said $700, Mike.

188
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.880
Yeah, I know it's not fucking Vogue.
So what?

189
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.000
Well, it's your choice.

190
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:33.960
Look, I'm hungry, I'm jet-lagged, and
I don't need this shit. Goodbye, Michael.

191
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.960
God, I'm sorry. I'm gonna get those
right out of your way.

192
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.560
- That's okay.
- I'm Vida.

193
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.800
- Carly Norris.
- Hi.

194
00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.480
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks.

195
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.760
Damn doormen.
I really tip them well, too.

196
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.400
Everybody does.

197
00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.560
That's why they're never around
when you need them.

198
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:53.440
You're right.
You should see them at Christmas.

199
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.240
Like flies on shit then.

200
00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.040
Oh, yeah, this guy was here.

201
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:04.160
He left this for you.

202
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.520
- You're all moved in, then?
- Oh, God, no. I hate it.

203
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.510
I know. It's worse than anal intercourse.

204
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.960
- You know, you look like...
- Yeah, the girl that...

205
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.240
- Naomi.
- Yeah.

206
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.960
Somebody's already told you.
I guess they would have.

207
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.510
- Were you friends?
- Well, sort of.

208
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.040
I mean, she was only here about a year.

209
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.280
And most of that time, I was in Milan.

210
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.360
Ass-pinching Italians.
My bum is still blue.

211
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.600
I couldn't believe it, though.

212
00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.720
I mean,
she just didn't seem like the type.

213
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.920
- Were you here when she...
- Yeah.

214
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.840
She came over
to borrow some coffee the night before.

215
00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.720
- I didn't have any.
- Caffeine withdrawal.

216
00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.240
That would do it to me.

217
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.200
That's my agent. He's a slimy bastard.

218
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.440
Just a goddamned second,
all right, Michael?

219
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.830
Hey. Thanks.

220
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.760
Right. So see you around.

221
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.320
If you ever need
any coffee or anything...

222
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.120
Just make sure you don't run out.

223
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.600
Mr. Brown. That's original.
And where's he staying?

224
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.920
The Regency Arms?

225
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.600
Okay.

226
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.200
And what's his room number?

227
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.710
627, got it.

228
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.360
Yeah, well, they all say
they're producers or sheiks.

229
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.120
Hi, putz. I'm giving you
your last chance for Pavarotti.

230
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.840
Hey, isn't Pearl Jam
some sort of oriental sex thing?

231
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.160
Yummy.

232
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.200
Carla, this is Zeke Hawkins calling.

233
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.360
I hope you remember me.

234
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.680
I live in the building, too.

235
00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.200
We met in the lobby when you were
moving in last weekend?

236
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:03.440
Anyway, listen, I was just calling
to let you know that if you...

237
00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.080
you know, need any help
with anything...

238
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.480
I have got some pull
with the manager, so...

239
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.070
don't be afraid to give me a call.

240
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:13.040
I'm at home most of the day.
My number's 555-3126.

241
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.120
All righty? Okay, bye.

242
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:20.400
Hi, it's Peter. We are moving up
the pub date on the Dean book.

243
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.640
Just thought I'd call
and let you know. Bye.

244
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.200
Yeah, but what about
the appointment with Sony in Osaka?

245
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:13.000
11:30 on Monday?

246
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.920
Oh, well, I'll do it anytime they will.

247
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.670
I mean, I have to see them.
They're state-of-the-art.

248
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.070
... defensive system
is extraordinarily developed.

249
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.120
Acute schizophrenic, non-paranoid.

250
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.280
Classic Jekyll-and-Hyde syndrome.

251
00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.280
Clearly a great danger to women.

252
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.200
No, no, no.
It's so good to hear your voice.

253
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.990
... we could rent one.

254
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.710
Well, that's an idea.

255
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.630
Hi, Zeke. It's Carla Norris.

256
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.480
Thanks for your call. I...

257
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.080
If I ever get unpacked around here...

258
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:51.840
I was thinking of having
a cocktail party on Friday night.

259
00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.480
Sometime after 6:00.

260
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.950
And I was wondering
if you'd like to come.

261
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.800
Okay, I hope that you do. Bye-bye.

262
00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:14.400
Brother!

263
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.040
- Oh, you think that was funny?
- Yeah.

264
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.880
I didn't think that was funny.
You scared the shit out of me.

265
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.230
Yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

266
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.560
I'm sorry.
You're right, it wasn't funny. I...

267
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:37.040
It was a real dumb-ass thing to do.
Really, I'm sorry.

268
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.320
Can we start over again? Huh?

269
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.840
What for? I really don't see the point.

270
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:47.830
- Hey, did you get the books?
- Yeah.

271
00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.750
- Did you read them?
- No.

272
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.600
Yeah, you did. You can't fool me.

273
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.150
I read a few pages of one of them.

274
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.310
You read both of them.
You couldn't put them down.

275
00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.310
I'm right, aren't I? Tell me I'm right.

276
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.470
You're wrong.

277
00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.160
What?

278
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.910
You don't like sex and violence?
It sells, you know.

279
00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.550
It buys ranches in Montana, I'm told.

280
00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.480
You've been checking on me. I like that.

281
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.360
- Thank you.
- For what?

282
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:15.960
For stopping.

283
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.830
Now, how about gossip?
About James Dean, for instance.

284
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.030
Doesn't that sell?

285
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.240
You've been checking on me.
I don't like that.

286
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.280
I hear you're very good at the tell-alls.

287
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.990
I guess that comes
from being married to a very boring guy.

288
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.880
You just like all the juicy talk.

289
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.320
- Fuck you.
- Would you like to?

290
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.830
I can try and make myself available.
Hey, look...

291
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.030
come on, I'm a writer.
People tell me their secrets...

292
00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.950
and I just take notes.
Like Truman Capote.

293
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.200
- You could tell me your secrets.
- I don't have any secrets.

294
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.270
Sure you do.

295
00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.400
What secrets do I have?

296
00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.110
I'd never tell.

297
00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:04.560
Did you send me the telescope?

298
00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.720
- Telescope?
- Yeah.

299
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.720
Why would I send you a telescope?

300
00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:13.880
Hey.

301
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.630
I can't keep up with you.

302
00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:21.590
No, you can't.

303
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.600
Taxi!

304
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.150
Excuse me, Officers, let her through,
please. She lives here. Come on.

305
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:52.400
Come on, Miss Norris. Come on.

306
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.550
- Do you live here?
- Did you know Mr. Hale?

307
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:55.920
How long have you lived
in this apartment?

308
00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:58.080
How do you feel
about all these accidents?

309
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:05.030
Yes, he was a lecturer at NYU.

310
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.630
He doesn't seem to have had
any family. That's about all I know.

311
00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.750
Miss? Miss?

312
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:23.240
- Are you a resident here?
- Yeah. Carla Norris...

313
00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.230
- 20-B.
- 20-B?

314
00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:31.590
- What happened?
- The guy in 23-B...

315
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.790
the professor, Gus Hale...

316
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.960
apparently he fell in the shower
and broke his neck.

317
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.150
Did you know Mr. Hale?

318
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.910
- I talked to him.
- What about?

319
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.190
Well, not that much, really.
We talked about...

320
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:51.670
that he was going to Japan.

321
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:56.470
- We talked about Naomi Singer.
- What did he say about Naomi Singer?

322
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.280
That they were friends, and...

323
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.430
that I look like her.

324
00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.960
You do.

325
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.400
I don't remember
giving you an invitation.

326
00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.040
I have a nose
for smelling parties in progress.

327
00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.070
Also, a bottle of Dom Perignon.

328
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.400
Come on in, honey. I like you already.

329
00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:53.800
- You hold and I'll pop.
- Yeah.

330
00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.430
Jack Landsford,
I'd like to introduce you...

331
00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.920
to Judy, of course.

332
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.400
Hi. Remember me?
We met in the doorway?

333
00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:04.150
- And Peter.
- Hi. How are you?

334
00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.830
- Pete. Hey, Alex.
- Jack, how are you?

335
00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.510
- Good. How you been?
- And you know Vida.

336
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.790
- Hi, I'm Vida Warren.
- Hello. Jack Landsford.

337
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.990
I'm sorry.
I thought you two knew each other.

338
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.430
Say "cheese."

339
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:20.990
Jesus!

340
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:26.670
- Oh, hey.
- Hello. Here you go.

341
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.110
- Is this Dom Perignon, too?
- California red.

342
00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.920
Oh. I'm sorry.

343
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.840
Now, this is very interesting.

344
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.480
It looks like Lalique, but it's not.
It's a copy.

345
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.270
You're right about that, Alex.

346
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.470
Nothing in the haunted house
is what it appears to be.

347
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.430
They've remodeled it completely.

348
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.590
Who owns it?

349
00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.680
I heard it was some law firm downtown.

350
00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.600
No. That's a false front.
I checked on that once.

351
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.600
I bet I could find out who owns it.

352
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.110
I know some people.

353
00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.310
I could make a few calls
if you really want to know.

354
00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.480
Pete, don't.

355
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.640
It could be the Mob.
We could be supporting crack dealers.

356
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.080
Then what are we gonna do? Move out?

357
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:11.680
There's an idea.

358
00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.150
Thank you.

359
00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.070
- It's a great party.
- Thank you.

360
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.510
Hey there. Can I get you something?

361
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.190
I'm fine, thanks.

362
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.630
- So, how do you like the new place?
- Oh, yeah.

363
00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.110
Did you know Naomi Singer?

364
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.270
Not really. I saw her around a few times.

365
00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:39.470
I wonder why she did it.

366
00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:44.350
Yeah. I don't know, I think I read
something about boyfriend troubles.

367
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.510
Oh, they're doing it!

368
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.710
Oh, they are! I can't believe it!

369
00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:51.830
Something exciting happening.

370
00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.400
I don't believe it. They are!

371
00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:58.630
Let me see. Let me see.

372
00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.400
Oh, they sure are.

373
00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:11.870
Would you look at her?
She's a voyeur. She can't get enough.

374
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.680
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.

375
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:16.710
That's why you have this telescope
out here.

376
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.950
- It's not even mine!
- You're a peeper! A peeper!

377
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.070
Somebody gave this to me.

378
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.200
- Right.
- Everybody has a telescope.

379
00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:26.950
- I don't.
- I do.

380
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.760
- Thank you.
- I do, too.

381
00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.990
I'm shocked. I'm truly shocked.
You people are shameless.

382
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.390
You're all shameless.
What is with you guys?

383
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.910
- Will you look at that?
- Come on, Alex.

384
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.760
- Hurry up, before they finish.
- Just a moment.

385
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.030
I wanna look, too.

386
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.630
Oh, my God!

387
00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.830
It looks like they're being Rolfed.

388
00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.350
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye.

389
00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.390
- Goodnight. Thank you for coming.
- Thanks. Bye.

390
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.990
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

391
00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.990
Goodnight. And thanks for the wine.

392
00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.550
- Sorry about the California red.
- I like California red.

393
00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.710
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

394
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.110
Listen, do you work out?

395
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.470
You mean,
like exercise bikes and stuff?

396
00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.350
No, no. The real thing. Weights.

397
00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.830
- You want to check it out?
- Oh. No, thank you.

398
00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.430
You would have a great time.

399
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.720
What do you think?
Tomorrow morning, maybe?

400
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.750
You know, there are mirrors
all over those places.

401
00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:32.910
There are no mirrors.

402
00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:35.720
They're everywhere you look.

403
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.870
No mirrors. Promise.

404
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.390
What do you say? 10:00? I'll call you?

405
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.960
I'll call you. Bye.

406
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.070
That was a great party.

407
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.990
I thank you.

408
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.990
You're welcome.

409
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.720
Who knows, maybe next time
I'll even get an invitation, huh?

410
00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.030
- Maybe.
- Oh, you got to be careful.

411
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.910
Maybe means "yes"
to an old ex-journalist like myself.

412
00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.750
The operative word being "ex."

413
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.230
Yeah.

414
00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.990
But us investigative reporters
never lose the instinct...

415
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.800
to jump in at the slightest opening.

416
00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:17.190
That would explain you jumping out
at me in the park, then, I guess.

417
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.200
No.

418
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.990
That was a tactic I developed
in junior high school to get the babes.

419
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:25.950
It didn't work then, either.

420
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.270
You don't go out much, do you?

421
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:34.870
I thought...

422
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.470
maybe in lieu of the gym...

423
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.710
you might want to go to dinner with me.

424
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.840
Maybe.

425
00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.040
I'll take that maybe as a yes.

426
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.830
- Goodnight, Carla.
- Goodnight, Jack.

427
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.550
... should climb to about 69 degrees.

428
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.510
Humidity levels slipping to about 15%.

429
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.910
Clouds and rain to return
with possible showers on Monday.

430
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.230
Temperatures for that period
should span the 60s and 70s.

431
00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.630
Now, here's the New York One
traveler's advisory...

432
00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.550
with a look at conditions
and temperatures...

433
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.710
for selected cities across the nation.

434
00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.390
Remember, weather on the One every
10 minutes, here on New York One.

435
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.990
Hello?

436
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.030
Is somebody out there?

437
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.710
What's the matter? Jesus!

438
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.790
- You okay, Miss Norris?
- Yes.

439
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.710
I hear something in my office.

440
00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.110
- What the hell happened?
- I was...

441
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.710
The lights went out, and...

442
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.030
the door was jammed,
and then I heard this sound. I just...

443
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.550
Look, it must have jammed.

444
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.950
Come on. I think all this
haunted house crap is getting to you.

445
00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.150
I don't believe it. You're such a liar.

446
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.950
Well, well, well. Looks like they must
have put up a few mirrors in here, huh?

447
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.390
Yeah, overnight, right?

448
00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.870
Come on. Come on.
The locker room's right over here.

449
00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.630
You conned me into this.

450
00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.750
It'll be fun. Trust me.

451
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.510
Okay. Your turn.

452
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.070
- I can't do that.
- Oh, yes, you can.

453
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.870
Come on. I'll teach you.

454
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.150
Okay.

455
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.710
Great. Great.

456
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.030
Just want to keep your hips straight.

457
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.310
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a very nice butt?

458
00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.510
- I already know you're a liar.
- You do.

459
00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.950
Nobody's told me that in a long time.

460
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.350
Well, that's because the wrong people
have been looking at it.

461
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.390
That's true.

462
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.510
- How often do you work out?
- Three, four times a week.

463
00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.830
I'm starving. How about you?

464
00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.470
Yeah.

465
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.820
How do you find the time?

466
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.550
I work at home.
I design computer video games.

467
00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.870
Oh, yeah?

468
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.870
You think I'm too young for you,
don't you?

469
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.190
What?

470
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.590
- You do, don't you?
- No.

471
00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.390
- I wasn't thinking about that.
- Liar.

472
00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.990
Yes, you were.

473
00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.540
I'm not.

474
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.430
You like it?

475
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:29.550
Yeah. I love it. I play it all the time.

476
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.990
- So you really do have the beer.
- I told you it wasn't a ruse.

477
00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.630
Thank you.

478
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.950
- What's that?
- A volcano.

479
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.390
I've always loved them.

480
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.100
I'd like to fly into one sometime.

481
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.070
Why?

482
00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.390
I don't know. It sounds like fun.

483
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:08.060
Don't you think?

484
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.260
I have to go.

485
00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.830
- Please, I...
- It's okay.

486
00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.470
You're so beautiful, Carly.

487
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.630
They'll see.

488
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:46.310
I want to see.

489
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.750
I want to see you.

490
00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.590
It's okay.

491
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.390
It's okay. I'm here.

492
00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.120
What are you worried about?

493
00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.890
Somebody's watching you
like you watch them?

494
00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.680
Why don't you come over here
with me and lie down?

495
00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.520
Why? So you can talk dirty to me
some more?

496
00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.170
Please?

497
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:54.940
Oh, I have to go.

498
00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:01.450
It's my building, Carly. I own it.

499
00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.460
I even helped redesign it.

500
00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:13.020
My father owned
a bunch of hotels, so I...

501
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:15.330
I inherited a lot of money.

502
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:18.620
And I didn't want to be bothered
with a lot of hassles...

503
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:20.300
so I just don't tell people that I own it.

504
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:24.740
Did you tell Mrs. McEvoy
to give me special treatment?

505
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:26.260
No.

506
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.100
But I did approve
your application quickly.

507
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:33.100
You had me all plotted out, huh?

508
00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:41.380
I just thought we would like each other.

509
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:44.130
You're not angry with me, are you?

510
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:12.970
Boy, have I got something to tell you.
You're not going to believe it!

511
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.610
This is Judy. Will you call me?

512
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:20.180
Where have you been?
I've been trying to call you all day.

513
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:23.210
Something's going on, I can smell it.

514
00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.020
You've probably been having
multiple orgasms.

515
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:29.010
You've probably been
fucking your brains out.

516
00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:31.860
I have.

517
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:35.780
Carly, Alex is all over me
about the Dean book.

518
00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:39.420
Please, please work on it
this weekend. Bye.

519
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:10.890
Goodnight.

520
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:13.810
Sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite.

521
00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.250
You do look like you fucked
your brains out. Look at you.

522
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.580
What are you smiling at?
That damn éclair?

523
00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:27.410
- I'm just smiling. That's all.
- Tell me.

524
00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:30.460
I want to know everything.
Every little grunt. Every little wiggle.

525
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:32.010
There's nothing to tell.

526
00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:36.010
You've been spending too much time
with your vibrator.

527
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:39.460
I certainly have.
I'm getting a plastic yeast infection.

528
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:41.700
Who is he? Do I know him? Tell me.

529
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:43.290
- Tell me.
- You met him.

530
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.580
I met him? And I didn't pin him
to the wall and ravish him myself?

531
00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:49.210
And you got him?
Now I'm pissed. Who?

532
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:51.980
It's Zeke. You met him at my apartment.

533
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:56.170
That gorgeous, young, incredible...
Oh, my God, I hate you.

534
00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.730
I really hate you. How is he?

535
00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:02.610
Give me the goods. Is he insatiable?
I bet he's insatiable.

536
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.250
They all are at that age.
Lead pencils, that's what they are.

537
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:08.100
I hate you. I really, really hate you.

538
00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:10.410
I mean, I go away
with the other one, right...

539
00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:12.890
for what I think is going to be
a hot, steamy weekend...

540
00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:15.330
and you're reloading a lead pencil.

541
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:17.650
I must have done something terrible
in my past life.

542
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:21.050
- Wait. You went off with who?
- Jack Landsford.

543
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:24.810
Who's not even a sharpened pencil,
let me tell you.

544
00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:27.820
We went to Montauk. Stayed in a cabin.

545
00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:33.570
- What happened?
- Nothing. Not a damn thing.

546
00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:36.530
The earth definitely did not move.

547
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:41.500
All he did was ask about you.
You know, you should go out with him.

548
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:44.660
Just to find out for me
if he's even got a pencil.

549
00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:03.930
I'll bet it's something blue.

550
00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.330
Something intimate.

551
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:08.210
Something lacy.

552
00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.410
Something whorish.

553
00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.930
How did you get in here?

554
00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:14.690
The door was open.

555
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:18.420
I've lived in New York for 10 years
and I've never left my door open.

556
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:20.770
Well, maybe you did this time.

557
00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:25.740
- Maybe the super did.
- I don't think so. I want you to leave.

558
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.810
He was having an affair
with Naomi Singer.

559
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:36.810
Maybe she smelt like flowers, too.

560
00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.850
Maybe you two
use the same spermicide.

561
00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:41.100
- I'm calling...
- She was seeing a shrink.

562
00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.450
She told the shrink about your boyfriend.

563
00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:48.410
And after Naomi was murdered,
the shrink told the police.

564
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:50.930
He's not my boyfriend.

565
00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:54.010
Oh? Well, what the hell is he, then?

566
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:57.850
The neighborhood florist?
I saw you two in the lobby together.

567
00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.370
I'm not blind.

568
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.820
My God, you really do look like her.

569
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:09.570
She died right here.

570
00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:15.450
She went off that balcony.

571
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:19.940
You don't really know
what you're dealing with, do you?

572
00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:22.970
He's fucked up.

573
00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:27.730
He's so very, very sick.

574
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:32.250
You don't believe me, do you?

575
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:37.170
All right. Here.

576
00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:41.570
You call Lieutenant Hendrix.
16th Precinct. Go on.

577
00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:44.810
Go on. Ask her.

578
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:59.770
Your boyfriend owns the building.

579
00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:01.850
I bet you didn't know that, did you?

580
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:05.100
I'll bet he didn't tell you, did he?

581
00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:08.020
Yes, he did.

582
00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.330
You know how difficult it was
for the police to discover that?

583
00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:16.530
This guy has more false fronts,
more high-powered attorneys...

584
00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:18.210
than Richard fucking Nixon!

585
00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:19.450
You know what I think?

586
00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:22.450
I think you can't write anymore.

587
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:28.250
And I think you're making this up
to hide the fact that you can't.

588
00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.650
I'm sorry for you, Jack.

589
00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.050
I really am.

590
00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.450
But if I ever find you
in my apartment again...

591
00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.290
I'm gonna have you
thrown out of the building.

592
00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:51.650
Goodbye.

593
00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:51.970
Are you hungry?

594
00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.490
- I've already eaten.
- Liar.

595
00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:00.050
You're afraid of me.

596
00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:04.370
Do I look like a girl
who would be frightened of you?

597
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.050
I did sort of come on strong yesterday.

598
00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:12.170
Well, I came on strong, too.

599
00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.090
Do you want to go out for some truffles?

600
00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:17.810
Truffles?

601
00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:22.330
- Now?
- Yeah, why not? I love truffles.

602
00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:27.890
- I don't have anything to wear.
- Wear what I sent you.

603
00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:30.970
Meet me downstairs in one hour.

604
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:34.770
Hurry. One hour.

605
00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:50.890
- Taxi!
- Did you think I wasn't coming?

606
00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:54.610
No.

607
00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:58.970
I knew you wanted me to think
that you weren't coming.

608
00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:03.930
You look good enough to eat.

609
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:21.840
- Are you ready to order yet, sir?
- Not yet, thank you.

610
00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:24.610
Very well, sir.

611
00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:28.130
- Your check, sir.
- Oh, thank you very much.

612
00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:31.290
- What?
- Nothing.

613
00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.610
You like playing games, don't you?

614
00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.530
I like playing games
with people who like playing games.

615
00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:42.690
What game do I like to play?

616
00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:46.970
Scrabble?

617
00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:50.650
I hate Scrabble
because I'm awful at Scrabble.

618
00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:56.650
- I like poker, though.
- So do I.

619
00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:00.130
- Would you like to play?
- Now?

620
00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:02.890
Right now.

621
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:06.730
The police came to see me today.

622
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:12.730
Found out I owned the building
and were asking all sorts of questions...

623
00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:13.930
about the wiring.

624
00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:17.520
I had such a terrible day,
I couldn't get any work done.

625
00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:22.090
Are we playing poker now?

626
00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:26.490
We're about to start.

627
00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:31.850
Did you like the bra and panties?

628
00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:35.450
Yes.

629
00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:37.410
Are you wearing them?

630
00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:43.610
Maybe.

631
00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:46.930
I think you are.

632
00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:50.170
Show me.

633
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:53.090
- Right here?
- Right here.

634
01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.690
I'm sorry. I can't see that.
I'm nearsighted.

635
01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.410
Can you see this?

636
01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.490
Yes.

637
01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.890
What about the panties?

638
01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.010
Panties?

639
01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.290
Yes. The panties.

640
01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:49.730
Are you wearing the panties?

641
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.290
Forget it.

642
01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:55.610
I win, you lose, this game.

643
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.490
I can't tell.

644
01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.290
I win, you lose.

645
01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.730
This game.

646
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:03.330
Are you ready to order yet, sir?

647
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.050
Where are we going?

648
01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:20.690
- Thirteen.
- It's an unlucky number.

649
01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.850
It's an unlucky apartment building.

650
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.250
Good night.

651
01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.130
Put these on.

652
01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:49.330
I wouldn't want you to catch a draft.

653
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:55.370
I'm okay. I'm pretty warm down there.

654
01:02:58.340 --> 01:02:59.810
See you soon.

655
01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:43.930
Zeke?

656
01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:51.440
Zeke?

657
01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.050
Hello?

658
01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.990
Damn you. You left the door open.

659
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.580
You knew I'd come.

660
01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.150
I thought we came together.

661
01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.230
Did you and Naomi come together?

662
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.910
I hardly knew her. I told you.

663
01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:08.030
She told someone
you had an affair with her.

664
01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:13.060
That's crazy. She came on to me once.

665
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:15.700
Maybe she fantasized.

666
01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.070
I heard she had an affair
with your friend.

667
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.870
- What friend?
- Your writer friend, Jack.

668
01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.550
- Who told you that?
- Your neighbor Vida.

669
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.190
She told me at your party. No big deal.

670
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:41.550
If you stay,
you could wake up in my arms.

671
01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:44.870
We could kiss to start the day.

672
01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.740
I could make you breakfast.

673
01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.270
We could go for a walk in the park
and hold hands.

674
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:57.150
Am I scaring you again?

675
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:01.550
I don't wanna get hurt.

676
01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.950
Hi. This is Vida. Leave a message.

677
01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:11.140
Vida? Vida, are you there?
It's Carly Norris.

678
01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.710
Vida, I need to talk to you
about something.

679
01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.100
Can you give me a call?

680
01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:19.630
It's really important.

681
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.540
- Hello?
- Jack, it's Carly Norris.

682
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.460
Hi.

683
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:35.310
Look, clearly this is
none of my business, but...

684
01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.390
Vida told me that it was you...

685
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.700
that was having an affair
with Naomi Singer.

686
01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.750
That's bullshit.

687
01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.630
Vida tell you that?

688
01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.660
No, I think your boyfriend
told you that, didn't he?

689
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:55.580
Vida didn't tell you that, did she?

690
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.590
Hey, Vida.

691
01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.820
Hi, I got your message.
I'll call you tonight.

692
01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:00.620
I've got a job and I'm really late.

693
01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.950
I just...

694
01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.420
I just wanted to...

695
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:06.420
Look, I don't wanna get caught in there.

696
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:09.380
- Vida, I wanted to talk to you.
- Yeah, I'll call you later, okay?

697
01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:12.390
Well, okay.

698
01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:44.940
Shit.

699
01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.220
Fucking building.

700
01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.390
You just lie there. Be still.

701
01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.940
Are you happy now? Are you happy?

702
01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.180
Carly?

703
01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.270
Oh, Jesus!

704
01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:10.380
Carly, don't run!

705
01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.830
Did Miss Warren know Jack Landsford?

706
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.270
I think so.

707
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:57.020
Because I saw Jack and Vida
on the street.

708
01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.460
- When was that?
- About a week ago.

709
01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:06.900
Jack was giving her some money.

710
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.870
This isn't your knife, is it, Jack?

711
01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:14.550
I don't think so.

712
01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.020
Hey, Jack, you know Vida Warren?

713
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:20.460
No. I mean, yeah.

714
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:22.700
I met her once at Carly Norris' party.

715
01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:24.820
You're somewhat of a player,
aren't you, Jack?

716
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:26.750
With the ladies, I mean.

717
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:31.590
I date, sure.
So do you, McCracken, you hump.

718
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:35.460
- Were you dating Vida Warren?
- No.

719
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:38.020
Oh, Jack. We got a problem.

720
01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.870
We found these pictures of you
all over her apartment.

721
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:48.420
Those are my publicity photos.
I keep them in my desk.

722
01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.540
He set me up.

723
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:57.230
- God damn it, he set me up!
- Who set you up, Jack?

724
01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.950
Zeke Hawkins, the guy in 13-A.
You talked to him yet?

725
01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:01.630
Well, why would he want
to do that, Jack?

726
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.860
A woman.

727
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:09.710
A woman. What woman?

728
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.390
Naomi Singer. Remember her?

729
01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.460
- The suicide?
- Yeah.

730
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:16.900
You got any idea why this Singer
woman would wanna kill herself, Jack?

731
01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:22.390
No. Hey, you guys know me.
I'm trying to find out. That's my craft.

732
01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:23.870
Were you seeing her, Jack?

733
01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:26.270
Yeah.

734
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:30.860
I mean, we got women dying all over
the place around you, don't we, Jack?

735
01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:33.900
- Hey, fuck you, McCracken.
- Hey, fuck you, Jack!

736
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.460
Back off, McCracken, will you?

737
01:13:35.470 --> 01:13:37.060
- Mac.
- Take it easy, Jack.

738
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:39.500
- Jesus Christ.
- You tell him to take it easy.

739
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:42.220
What's the matter with you guys?
You know me. I didn't do this.

740
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:45.980
- I want my attorney.
- All right.

741
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:48.100
You spent part of the year
up in Montana.

742
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:50.380
You got some kind of a ranch
up there, Jack?

743
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:51.540
Yeah, so what?

744
01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:53.540
- What's the name of that place?
- The name?

745
01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:55.460
- Yeah, the name.
- The Flying L.

746
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:57.140
The Flying L, huh?

747
01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.580
You parking your horse
in Vida Warren's closet, partner?

748
01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:06.500
- I want my attorney down here now.
- All right.

749
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.140
- I want him now!
- You'll get him.

750
01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:09.780
The D.A.'s gonna charge him.

751
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:13.580
He will make bail.

752
01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:30.380
He's coming back here, isn't he?

753
01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.150
We'll know it if he does.

754
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:37.020
How will we know?
He could be there right now.

755
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:42.740
Let's see if he is.

756
01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:50.060
Come on.

757
01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:57.590
You know my mother was an actress
on the soaps?

758
01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.220
She used to spend
most of the year in LA.

759
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:03.580
I used to take a cab home from school
and watch her on TV.

760
01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.380
That was just about my life with her.

761
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:12.420
I had it custom-built in Osaka.

762
01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.020
It cost me $6 million.

763
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:21.860
He's not there.

764
01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:24.900
We'll know if he is, though.

765
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:35.540
Tomorrow night.
Yeah, I have to be in at 5:00.

766
01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:38.700
No, it's just me. Can you believe it?
There must have been 600 girls there.

767
01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.940
Put my apartment on.

768
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:43.380
- There's nobody home there, either.
- Put it on.

769
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:47.060
Aren't you gonna come meet us?

770
01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:51.260
Yeah, we're gonna be there in
about a half hour, if I can get ready.

771
01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:55.460
No, I think Henry will be there.

772
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:57.620
No, he just called me, like,
20 minutes ago.

773
01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.110
What does that have
to do with anything?

774
01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.620
My God, have you slept with her?

775
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:03.580
Did you sleep with her?
Simple question, Will.

776
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:05.500
You're making me do something
I don't want to do.

777
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:06.660
I know.

778
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:11.500
You watch them?

779
01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:16.100
- You watch these people?
- So do you, Carly, with your telescope.

780
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:18.860
- Oh, you...
- I just have better technology.

781
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:26.220
You want gossip?
I'll give you real gossip. Real life, Carly.

782
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:31.500
It's better than any book.
Better than any movie.

783
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:35.340
It's a soap opera. It's real life.

784
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:39.260
It's a tragedy, it's funny,
it's sad, it's unpredictable.

785
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:42.420
- Look for yourself, Carly.
- It's wrong.

786
01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:45.500
It's the same as your James Dean book.

787
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:46.780
Only nobody gets hurt.

788
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:48.100
- You ready?
- Yes...

789
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:51.940
They don't even know.

790
01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:54.580
Open the door, Zeke.

791
01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:58.140
Look, Carly, don't...

792
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:04.820
I love you.

793
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:35.140
Give me a little bit more time,
for God's sake!

794
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:45.820
You will ride with your dad, okay?
That's it. No more.

795
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:52.580
He's not my father, and I'm not riding
with him alone. I don't...

796
01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:54.780
Jonie, get back in here!
Jonie! Come here.

797
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:56.140
You be nicer to him!

798
01:18:56.150 --> 01:18:58.460
- He touches me.
- Stop it!

799
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:02.980
He puts his hands on me, Mom,
every chance he gets.

800
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:04.980
Don't start. I don't wanna hear it.

801
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:07.460
He is a decent, hard-working man.

802
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:10.620
I hate him! I hate him!

803
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:14.660
- Don't you...
- I hate you, Mom! I hate you!

804
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:21.820
The little girl's right.
Every chance he gets.

805
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:23.980
I hate him, Pony, I really do. I hate him.

806
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:26.500
Whenever the mother's not around,
he's got his hands all over her.

807
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:53.540
Why don't you give it a try?
You just have to tap the touch screen.

808
01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:10.620
There are some alternatives.
I realize you're in a lot of pain.

809
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:24.900
- Would you like something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

810
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:28.340
You haven't eaten anything all day.

811
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:34.860
You're like a kid with a new toy.

812
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:38.340
But it's not a toy, is it?

813
01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:42.330
No.

814
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:44.740
Are you the one
that sent me the telescope?

815
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:46.970
Yes.

816
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:49.980
Why did you do it?

817
01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:00.370
Not now, honey.

818
01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.370
What did the x-ray show?

819
01:22:03.670 --> 01:22:05.530
Some kind of shadow, that's all.

820
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:07.580
Don't worry about it.
It could be anything.

821
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:11.740
Baby, please tell me everything.
What did he say?

822
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:18.180
- He said it might be a tumor.
- A tumor?

823
01:22:18.630 --> 01:22:21.220
Were you watching Vida
when she got killed?

824
01:22:21.230 --> 01:22:25.290
No. The lights had gone down
in the stairwell.

825
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:27.700
What about the others?

826
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:30.260
I wasn't watching.

827
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:32.780
I did see Gus Hale
on the floor of the shower, though.

828
01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.540
I was the one who called the police.

829
01:22:35.190 --> 01:22:36.340
Do you tape these?

830
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:39.020
Yes.

831
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:42.780
Did you tape us?

832
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:45.220
Would you like to see?

833
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:50.260
Yes.

834
01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:03.410
There's so much on this tape.

835
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:04.980
Come on, where is it?

836
01:23:05.710 --> 01:23:08.970
You see, sometimes I just let it run
on record in one apartment for a while.

837
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:10.860
Like my own little soap opera.

838
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:15.570
I don't even have the time
to watch most of what I record.

839
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:19.210
It's amazing what I've found
on some of these tapes.

840
01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:12.580
Good morning.

841
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:03.970
Oh, God. Are you all right?

842
01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.420
- Carly.
- I'm fine.

843
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:07.730
We've been so worried about you.
Everybody's been calling.

844
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:10.300
Yeah, and to think I spent the weekend
with an impotent maniac...

845
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:13.570
hoping that he'd, you know...
The police even talked to me.

846
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:14.770
Carly Norris.

847
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:17.140
- Carly, will you come and see me later...
- It's Zeke Hawkins.

848
01:25:17.150 --> 01:25:18.410
...and tell me the real skinny?

849
01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:20.020
I wanna hear everything, darling.

850
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:25.380
- Hello?
- Hey, guess what?

851
01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:29.340
I called Ballinger at his office, you know
the guy who can't keep his hands...

852
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:30.500
off his stepdaughter?

853
01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:34.570
I told him if he ever touched her again,
I'd kill him.

854
01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:38.500
- What did he do?
- He panicked, that's what he did.

855
01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:40.700
I just wish you could have heard him.

856
01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:43.980
Hey, maybe we should
start wiring the whole town, huh?

857
01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:46.210
That way we could see everything.

858
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:51.810
You there, Carly?

859
01:25:53.150 --> 01:25:54.530
I don't know what to do.

860
01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:01.700
Just come home, you.

861
01:26:02.190 --> 01:26:04.180
- Bye.
- Bye.

862
01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:50.620
Don't you scream.
Don't. I'm not gonna hurt you.

863
01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.650
He set me up, Carly. Zeke set me up.

864
01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:57.570
I believe you. I do, I believe you.

865
01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:02.450
It's okay. Let me go. Let me go.

866
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:06.220
He's sick. That man is sick.

867
01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:11.650
His mother died when he was 17.
She was a soap opera actress.

868
01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:13.740
Do you know how she died? She fell.

869
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:15.810
- She fell?
- She fell in the shower.

870
01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.420
- Look!
- What?

871
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:21.690
Look, Carly. Thea Manning.
That's his mother, Carly.

872
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:24.780
- Who does she look like?
- Oh, she...

873
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:27.610
She looks like you, Carly.

874
01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:38.620
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

875
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:41.010
Hey, are you coming down?

876
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:44.820
- Why don't you come over here?
- Why? What's up?

877
01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:49.380
Well, because I have a surprise for you.

878
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:52.490
Great. I'll be right there.

879
01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:54.340
Okay.

880
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:59.140
- Sit down.
- Okay.

881
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:10.810
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

882
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:13.820
A little dark in here, don't you think?

883
01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:16.980
- He's got a gun!
- Sit down! All right, you bastard!

884
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:19.180
You tell the truth now,
or I'll blow your brains out.

885
01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:22.380
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You killed Naomi Singer.

886
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:23.650
No, I didn't.

887
01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:26.260
- How'd your mother die, Zeke?
- My mother?

888
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:28.740
Yeah, she fell in the shower,
wasn't that it?

889
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:30.330
She had an aneurysm and fell.

890
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:32.860
She fell in the shower
the way you killed Gus Hale.

891
01:28:33.390 --> 01:28:35.970
- Gus Hale?
- Yeah, and he killed Vida, too.

892
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:38.090
Didn't you? Didn't you?

893
01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:41.940
Three now, Jack? I killed three people?

894
01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.490
First of all, I didn't
even know Naomi Singer.

895
01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:48.570
But you did, Jack.
Because I saw you with her.

896
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:51.330
So I know
why you would want to kill her.

897
01:28:51.710 --> 01:28:53.210
What do you mean, you saw us?

898
01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:55.410
I also saw her give you a key
to this apartment, right, Jack?

899
01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:59.050
Is that how he got in here
this time, huh?

900
01:28:59.750 --> 01:29:01.660
- Is it?
- You still have the key, don't you?

901
01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.930
- Why don't you show it to us, Jack?
- What the hell are you talking about?

902
01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:07.980
I'm talking about the fact that you
just couldn't get it up, could you, Jack?

903
01:29:08.670 --> 01:29:11.810
I saw that, too.
Is that why you killed her, Jack?

904
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:16.100
- Is it? Is it?
- He's lying, Carly. He's lying.

905
01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:17.850
Jack, I don't know what to believe.

906
01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:19.460
Just show me the key.

907
01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:25.050
No, Jack! No.

908
01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:45.650
Jack, let go! Jack. No!

909
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:52.290
Oh, my...

910
01:29:56.030 --> 01:30:00.890
Because he was already in this room,
but I didn't see him.

911
01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:05.530
And when he came out,
I saw that he had a gun.

912
01:30:06.630 --> 01:30:08.690
He started screaming at me.

913
01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:11.370
And...

914
01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:18.130
Sorry.

915
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:23.370
Then we wrestled around
on the ground.

916
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:25.810
And...

917
01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:30.450
the gun skidded across the floor there...

918
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:34.420
and I picked it up.

919
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:37.970
How did he get in?

920
01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:40.370
Your door wasn't forced.

921
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:45.420
He must have had a key.

922
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:48.860
I mean, it was just like before.
He was already in here.

923
01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:50.820
He had these in his pocket.

924
01:30:52.230 --> 01:30:53.330
Try them.

925
01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:09.250
Jack Landsford's got a sheet with us.
He's a known offender.

926
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:13.740
Assaulted his ex-wife more than once.
She dropped charges.

927
01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:16.290
I wish she hadn't.

928
01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:19.050
Maybe we wouldn't
have two women dead.

929
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:22.730
He didn't get in with these.

930
01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:26.610
- You guys about done here?
- Finished.

931
01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:31.820
- Where?
- Floor, next to the counter.

932
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:35.050
This yours?

933
01:31:36.630 --> 01:31:37.770
No.

934
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:52.610
Bingo.

935
01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.130
Well, that wraps it.

936
01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:58.210
The D.A.'s gonna need to see you both
tomorrow morning...

937
01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:01.370
down at the precinct. Say, 9:30?

938
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:04.810
You know where it is.

939
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:09.010
Let's secure it.

940
01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:32.530
I don't...

941
01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.370
I don't want to stay here tonight.

942
01:32:37.710 --> 01:32:39.180
Stay with me.

943
01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:45.170
Stay with me.

944
01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:47.980
Okay?

945
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:53.410
Jonie, can we talk for a minute?

946
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:03.250
Have you told anyone that I...

947
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:08.530
- Just Mom.
- You're sure?

948
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:15.690
Jonie, I'm sorry.

949
01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:20.370
It was just, I couldn't help myself.

950
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:26.450
It'll never happen again.
I swear it. Never.

951
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:35.410
It's like playing God.

952
01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:39.330
- We'll only do good things.
- I don't want to do this.

953
01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:43.570
I want my privacy.
I want my own experiences.

954
01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.570
Zeke, I want to have a real relationship.

955
01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:51.180
Carly, I love you.
You can have anything you want.

956
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:54.450
I want my tape.

957
01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:58.020
If I have you, I don't need them, right?

958
01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:02.690
Hold on.

959
01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:45.970
Erased.

960
01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:51.210
- You okay?
- Yeah.

961
01:34:52.670 --> 01:34:53.940
Tired.

962
01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:56.530
And hungry, I guess.

963
01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:01.010
I'll go get something for us.
What would you like?

964
01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:02.370
Anything.

965
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:08.850
You're so beautiful.

966
01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:18.490
Be right back.

967
01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.250
You're so beautiful, Vida.

968
01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:22.780
You're so beautiful, Vida.

969
01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:25.890
You smell so good.

970
01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:46.490
You smell so good.

971
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:53.930
I love you, Naomi.

972
01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:00.090
I love you. You smell like roses.

973
01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.270
Carly.

974
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.340
Come on. Come on, open the door!
Let's go. Open up!

975
01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:43.630
Hey, come on!

976
01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.190
Carly...

977
01:38:06.690 --> 01:38:08.350
you're watching me, aren't you?

978
01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.150
Are you looking at me?

979
01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:21.510
You're looking at me.
I can tell, I can feel it.

980
01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.830
I love you, Carly.

981
01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.540
Carly, let me in. Come on.

982
01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:38.510
Peekaboo. You see me.

983
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.190
Come on, open the door. Now.

984
01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:44.190
Now, Carly! Open the fucking door!

985
01:38:45.250 --> 01:38:48.070
Come on,
open this cocksucking door, now!

986
01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:51.590
Open up! Come on!

987
01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:55.790
Open up the fucking door, Carly, now!

988
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:19.590
You like to watch? Watch this.

989
01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:24.110
Carly! No, stop!

990
01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.390
Those women meant nothing to me.

991
01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.990
It was just sex, Carly.

992
01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:40.790
I love you.

993
01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:50.230
That was the past.

994
01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:54.070
What we have is so powerful, Carly.
Can't you feel it?

995
01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.670
It feels so good.

996
01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.670
You can feel it, can't you?

997
01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:04.190
Give me the gun, Carly.

998
01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:11.660
I love you, Carly.

999
01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:48.470
Carly!

1000
01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:53.790
Carly, please! Please don't!

1001
01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:56.910
Carly, please don't!

1002
01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.300
Carly!

1003
01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.020
Get a life.
