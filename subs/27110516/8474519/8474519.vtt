1
00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:43.752
For the recording,
the time is 3:14 a.m., Port of Virginia.

2
00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:45.045
Mission brief:

3
00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:49.132
Apprehend suspected terrorist
Amin Mansur's radiological device.

4
00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:53.011
Intel suggests fallout radius
of up to five miles.

5
00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:56.932
Suspected target: downtown D.C., tonight.

6
00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.059
Known terror cell already on-site.

7
00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:02.437
-Eyes of God, what do you see?
-Overwatch online and in position.

8
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.691
Cargo crate on the move.
Looks like they're checking container IDs.

9
00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:09.319
Lomax online.
I have a visual. Mission is a go.

10
00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:11.405
Alpha online.

11
00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.490
-Sync body cams.
-Bravo online.

12
00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.951
Let them reveal the identity
of the container first.

13
00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:18.829
Securing that dirty bomb
is the only priority.

14
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.456
Alpha team, can you get any closer?

15
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.708
Negative. Negative.

16
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.960
Alpha, hold position.
Spotter in the truck.

17
00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.712
Overwatch, take him out.

18
00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:28.839
Target down.

19
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:29.923
Moving.

20
00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:36.221
They've identified the container.
They're cutting the lock.

21
00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:38.891
-Copy. Bravo team joining.
-Game time.

22
00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:40.184
-Ready.
-Ready.

23
00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:41.268
Go.

24
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:45.981
-Alpha in position.
-Hold. We're five seconds out.

25
00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.026
They're through the lock.
It's now or never.

26
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.117
Bravo in position. Three, two, one.

27
00:01:57.201 --> 00:01:59.161
-Homeland Security!
-Get on the ground!

28
00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:00.996
Down on the ground now!

29
00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:04.291
Get down! Get down!

30
00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.752
Get down on the ground now!

31
00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.128
Get the fuck down!

32
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:09.963
All targets down.

33
00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:13.133
-Alpha team, secure that bomb.
-Checking now.

34
00:02:13.217 --> 00:02:15.928
Radiation levels, normal.

35
00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:17.971
No, that can't be. It's here.

36
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:20.098
-Could be lead-lined.
-Open her up.

37
00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.601
Wanna tell me what's in there?

38
00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:27.064
What, no English?

39
00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.195
Container empty.
Negative on the package. No bomb.

40
00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.154
Where is it?

41
00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.540
What do you wanna do? It's not here.

42
00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.389
This mission footage was taken

43
00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:03.684
at a container terminal
in Virginia early this morning.

44
00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:09.648
Now Homeland Security has access
to intelligence that alludes to an RDD.

45
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.443
That would be
a radiological dispersal device.

46
00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:14.778
We believe the target

47
00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:18.866
is tonight's State of the Union address
by the president to Congress.

48
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.743
I don't know anything about any bomb.

49
00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.622
We tracked the manifest,

50
00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:29.209
and your husband's company shipped
the container through Europe.

51
00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:30.878
What do you know?

52
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.339
I haven't seen Amin in four months.

53
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.343
Look, all we want you to do
is to talk to him

54
00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.471
and try to convince him
to cooperate with us. That's all.

55
00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.516
He cleaned out our savings.

56
00:03:45.184 --> 00:03:48.645
He left me pregnant
and vanished without a trace.

57
00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:50.856
We're not exactly on speaking terms.

58
00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:55.277
That sounds awful. I'm sorry, I...

59
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.530
-What would you want me to say?
-Oh, in scenarios like this,

60
00:03:58.614 --> 00:04:02.242
I guess, people need to reassess
who their friends are.

61
00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:06.038
-I don't know, I suppose-- I don't know.
-And what if I refuse?

62
00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.208
-Refuse?
-Yes.

63
00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.130
Well, then, I guess we'll just put you up

64
00:04:15.214 --> 00:04:17.674
at the Hyatt Regency Hotel
on Capitol Hill,

65
00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:21.720
and you can spend the rest of today
relaxing in their beautiful spa,

66
00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:24.431
and take a flight back to London tomorrow.

67
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.225
What, that's it?

68
00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:27.935
Yeah, sure. That's it.

69
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.980
But if that thing goes off tonight,

70
00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:35.317
you and your baby will be at ground zero

71
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.194
with front-row seats

72
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:42.282
to witness the first dirty bomb attack
on U.S. soil in history.

73
00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.039
Agent Hooper?

74
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.917
-Sir?
-How much longer?

75
00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:54.795
Mansur's plane is landing now.

76
00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:58.090
Escort's ETA to link up with us
is five to six minutes.

77
00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.509
The transfer should be relatively quick.

78
00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.408
-Okay, let's wrap and go.
-Stay alert.

79
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.161
-Spin the cargo. Prep to leave.
-Yes, ma'am.

80
00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.079
-Get ready to spin them around.
-Yes, sir.

81
00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:13.707
-Cargo 2 disembarking.
-Roger that.

82
00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:14.833
Follow me.

83
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.465
You two, with me.

84
00:06:22.174 --> 00:06:23.175
Coming!

85
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:26.595
Marshall.

86
00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:28.013
-Am I speaking to Mike?
-Yes.

87
00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.057
POTUS wants me
to pull the additional security.

88
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.142
No, no, no.

89
00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:35.437
Our recommendation
has not changed one iota.

90
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:36.647
It still stands.

91
00:06:36.772 --> 00:06:38.815
It's not happening.
It's not a good look for him.

92
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:42.653
POTUS is going to have
to cancel his address on the Hill tonight.

93
00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.696
You're not listening.
It makes him seem weak--

94
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.866
It's not my job
to worry about his poor poll ratings.

95
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.452
I mean, come on. You saw the intel.

96
00:06:50.536 --> 00:06:52.204
This is a credible threat.

97
00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:53.455
Can't do it, Mike.

98
00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:56.750
We need to evacuate everybody
on Capitol Hill.

99
00:06:56.834 --> 00:07:00.087
It's the State
of the fucking Union address.

100
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.216
-He can't just cancel--
-With all due respect, madam,

101
00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:07.386
you are the chief of staff
of the White House.

102
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.429
I am not going to lose my job...

103
00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:11.306
You're the one that needs to convince him.

104
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.474
...on a CIA hunch.

105
00:07:12.558 --> 00:07:14.726
And that is your job.

106
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.228
Morons!

107
00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:19.898
Special Agent Jennifer Lomax, Homeland.
Welcome to Baltimore.

108
00:07:20.524 --> 00:07:22.192
Lomax. Walk.

109
00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:24.027
So explain to me

110
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:29.366
why the hell Homeland have
all these leads on a bomb, but no bomb.

111
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.368
We are doing the best we can--

112
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.871
Not good enough. We have two hours left.

113
00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:35.539
A lot of people could die tonight.

114
00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:37.833
Let's hope for your sake
that Mansur talks.

115
00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.710
Marshall, we believe
the CIA have a leak...

116
00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:40.878
Morons.

117
00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:43.297
...which is why
we changed the destination.

118
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.841
Are you trying to annoy me, Lomax?

119
00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.844
Homeland had concerns about security, sir.

120
00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.180
Oh, they did? They had concerns?

121
00:07:51.263 --> 00:07:55.058
So you decided
you would reroute my prisoner

122
00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:59.396
from Andrews Air Force Base
to some old regular airport?

123
00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:01.690
You call that secure?

124
00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:04.067
We've shut down the entire terminal, sir.

125
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:06.486
Media has been briefed
that there's a natural gas leak,

126
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.031
which means
there's a no-fly zone within a full mile.

127
00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:12.534
The asset is on the tarmac.
They're transporting him to us.

128
00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.244
Thank you, Agent Hooper.

129
00:08:15.454 --> 00:08:19.708
Well, make yourself useful,
young agent of the realm.

130
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.793
Of course, sir. Anything you need?

131
00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:24.463
Yeah, as a matter of fact...

132
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:31.595
You might want
to comfort Mrs. Mansur. She's fragile.

133
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:33.430
But, sir--

134
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.266
Marshall.

135
00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:39.061
Well, it's about time.

136
00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:41.271
He's even less charming
once you get to know him.

137
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.776
Wait, you were in the video.

138
00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.736
The mission at the docks?

139
00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.530
How did you see...?

140
00:08:49.613 --> 00:08:52.950
Guess he wanted me
to understand what's at stake.

141
00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:54.868
Yes.

142
00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.579
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:00.958
Don't be. Just help us fix this.

144
00:09:04.086 --> 00:09:06.964
We're going to give you and your husband
a few minutes together

145
00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:10.008
so you can talk after he arrives.

146
00:09:10.092 --> 00:09:12.010
What am I supposed to say to him?

147
00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:18.559
Well, make him happy
about the coming of the new baby.

148
00:09:18.642 --> 00:09:21.895
Make him feel
like you two could reconnect again.

149
00:09:21.979 --> 00:09:27.609
I... No, we have to make him feel like
there's something he could really lose.

150
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:28.986
You understand?

151
00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:32.614
And if I don't want
to feel reconnected with him?

152
00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:40.289
-Then lie.
-Sir?

153
00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:44.710
They're here.

154
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.921
Roger that, Agent Hooper.

155
00:09:50.174 --> 00:09:53.552
-Let's get this handoff done. Let's go.
-Mike, take the back.

156
00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:54.720
Keep moving.

157
00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.644
Amin, what have you done?

158
00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:06.815
Who's that man with him?

159
00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:09.735
That's the guy
who saved your husband's life.

160
00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:13.363
I have eyes on Mansur.
Prep to leave. This way, sir.

161
00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:14.948
I don't feel so good.

162
00:10:15.908 --> 00:10:17.242
Let's get you sitting.

163
00:10:18.327 --> 00:10:21.413
Hooper, let's get out of here
as soon as possible.

164
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.586
Got one Amin Mansur for you.

165
00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.796
I need his cuff key.
Come sign these forms.

166
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.881
Sure.

167
00:10:33.926 --> 00:10:35.385
Amin Mansur.

168
00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:39.473
I am Mike Marshall, with the CIA.

169
00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:43.310
Where's Niesha?
You said she'd be waiting here.

170
00:10:50.192 --> 00:10:51.693
It's okay. It's okay.

171
00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:53.946
Let him go.

172
00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.160
Did he give you any trouble?

173
00:11:00.244 --> 00:11:02.871
We were told not to engage.
He seems very confused.

174
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.000
-Niesha.
-No. Don't.

175
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:33.652
Is it true?

176
00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:36.488
Yes.

177
00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:39.783
A boy?

178
00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:48.333
Why didn't you tell me?

179
00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:50.794
Because you left.

180
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:01.138
Lieutenant, a word.

181
00:12:05.434 --> 00:12:09.938
Tell me, what really happened
out there in Poland?

182
00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:13.317
I should be asking you the same question.

183
00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:18.447
We had no intel, no air support,
completely on our own.

184
00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:21.909
I lost my whole team,
keeping that piece of shit alive.

185
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.037
And I lost one of mine.

186
00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:27.331
Anderson.

187
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:29.416
That's right. Anderson.

188
00:12:30.292 --> 00:12:32.461
She was one of my best profilers.

189
00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:36.548
But more than that,
she was a dear, dear friend.

190
00:12:37.883 --> 00:12:39.009
And you...

191
00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:41.970
You should've protected her.

192
00:12:42.054 --> 00:12:44.681
My orders were to deliver Mansur.

193
00:12:46.308 --> 00:12:47.518
I disagree.

194
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:52.773
And I contacted Special Operations Command

195
00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:57.444
and have asked them to do an investigation
on your bungling of this operation.

196
00:12:57.528 --> 00:12:59.446
What the hell
are you talking about, Marshall?

197
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.323
You think it was some random attack?

198
00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:03.742
Bunch of insurgents turned up
out of the fucking blue?

199
00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.119
No, they were there for him, okay?

200
00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:08.914
Well-trained soldiers
with a clear objective.

201
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.085
Somebody tipped them off
and I wanna know who.

202
00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:16.922
-All right. Hey! Hey!
-Protect the suspect!

203
00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:20.759
-Enough of this crap!
-Why?!

204
00:13:20.843 --> 00:13:23.762
Get him out of here
and take him to questioning now!

205
00:13:23.846 --> 00:13:26.640
Take her over there.
Just give her a moment.

206
00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:29.142
-Where are you going, lieutenant?
-She just needs a moment.

207
00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:31.895
I'm not leaving his side
till we find out where that device is.

208
00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:34.731
My men gave their lives
for this intel, Marshall.

209
00:13:34.857 --> 00:13:35.816
One more thing.

210
00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:41.238
I called Admiral Mulholland
while you were in the air,

211
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:46.577
and he wants you to report directly to him
for debriefing in Little Creek.

212
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.828
Immediately.

213
00:13:48.579 --> 00:13:49.788
Now.

214
00:13:50.706 --> 00:13:51.748
You're done.

215
00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.251
Hooper!

216
00:13:55.878 --> 00:13:58.505
Escort Lieutenant Harris off the airport.

217
00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:01.341
Get him some transportation.

218
00:14:01.425 --> 00:14:03.093
Come on, Harris. Time to go.

219
00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:06.430
Make sure you finish the job, Marshall.

220
00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:16.857
-Get these to Agent Burton.
-Yes, ma'am.

221
00:14:31.288 --> 00:14:33.457
-You take him from here.
-Yes, ma'am.

222
00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:35.751
Let's go.

223
00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:38.337
Stay on the door. Don't let him back in.

224
00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:44.343
And we're told that the president

225
00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:47.221
will be announcing
a slate of new initiatives

226
00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:50.057
for both the environment and for tax cuts.

227
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.683
And after the State of the Union,

228
00:14:51.767 --> 00:14:55.020
we will have the opposition
with their response.

229
00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:56.772
But to tell more about this,

230
00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:59.733
we go now live
to Martha Johnson down at the Capitol.

231
00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:01.527
Martha, how's it going down there?

232
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.280
-A massive security operation...
-Exit's on the right, up the escalator.

233
00:15:05.364 --> 00:15:07.574
...annual State of the Union address.

234
00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:09.993
In just under two hours' time,

235
00:15:10.077 --> 00:15:13.914
the president will deliver his verdict
on the current condition of the nation.

236
00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:15.374
In the audience will be members

237
00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:17.876
of all three branches
of the federal government,

238
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.004
the joint chiefs of staff,
and the diplomatic corps.

239
00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:22.840
It's one of the few occasions

240
00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:26.552
when the president, the vice president,
and the other key officials...

241
00:15:28.637 --> 00:15:30.389
Hey. Hey.

242
00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:33.183
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

243
00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:34.935
You okay? Can you hear me?

244
00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.730
They've been contacting
the families all day.

245
00:15:38.814 --> 00:15:42.234
I know. I know. I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I was trying to call you, I promise.

246
00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.820
I just didn't have the chance. I'm okay.

247
00:15:45.821 --> 00:15:48.073
-I'm okay.
-Okay.

248
00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.325
Ava called.

249
00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:53.078
And she said Whit's gone.

250
00:15:53.662 --> 00:15:54.663
Danny too.

251
00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:56.582
Whit didn't make it.

252
00:15:57.416 --> 00:15:58.750
Danny didn't make it.

253
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.797
Nobody made it. They're all gone.

254
00:16:03.881 --> 00:16:06.049
-Everyone, the whole team.
-How is that even possible?

255
00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:07.551
How is that possible?

256
00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.346
I don't know.
They're saying it's my fault.

257
00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:15.851
Maybe it was my fault.
I don't even know anymore.

258
00:16:16.602 --> 00:16:18.729
That is not true, Jake.

259
00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:20.522
I know you. That is not true.

260
00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:25.944
I need you to do me a favor, okay?
You need to go to Ava's.

261
00:16:26.028 --> 00:16:28.739
You need to help her
with baby Tia, all right?

262
00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:30.616
Until her mom gets back from Florida.

263
00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:33.660
They're gonna need our help.
Can you do that?

264
00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:36.955
Yeah. I'll take the kids with me.

265
00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:40.876
But, sweetheart, are you gonna be okay?

266
00:16:42.586 --> 00:16:43.587
I'm okay.

267
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.381
I miss you.

268
00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:51.386
Where even are you? Are you at an airport?

269
00:16:52.513 --> 00:16:54.056
Wait, are you in America?

270
00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:55.766
Yeah, I'm stateside. Yeah.

271
00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:58.435
Are you coming home?

272
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.313
I don't know yet.

273
00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:04.525
Mansur is the target.
Keep him alive by any means.

274
00:17:04.608 --> 00:17:07.361
-We know how many CIA agents are on-site?
-Jake, we need you.

275
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:09.571
When are you coming home?

276
00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:11.448
Hey.

277
00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.121
I'm gonna have to call you back, okay?
I'll call you back.

278
00:17:54.825 --> 00:17:56.285
Pack up and prep weapons.

279
00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:57.870
Wait for Jackson's mark.

280
00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.081
I said, move that body.

281
00:18:03.292 --> 00:18:04.543
Heavy bastard.

282
00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:07.546
All teams, this is Jackson.
We're two minutes out.

283
00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:10.299
Things go south, cut the comms. Sound off.

284
00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:11.884
-Alpha, traveling.
-Bravo, traveling.

285
00:18:11.967 --> 00:18:15.387
-Charlie team in position, holding.
-I can tell Jackson's pissed.

286
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.307
I'd be pissed too. We were supposed
to be out of the country by now.

287
00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:25.230
Get the fuck off him!

288
00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:33.655
Can you see him?

289
00:18:33.739 --> 00:18:36.033
You! You there! Stop! Stop!

290
00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:44.666
Multiple targets!

291
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.335
-Move up!
-Two on the right!

292
00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:47.878
Get Mansur out of here!

293
00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:49.505
-Reloading.
-Reloading!

294
00:18:50.339 --> 00:18:51.882
Back in. Fuck!

295
00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.217
Man down.

296
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.385
He's on your right! He's on your right!

297
00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:57.346
-Amin!
-Come on! Move! Get out of the way!

298
00:18:57.429 --> 00:19:00.390
What the hell's going on, Harris?
What the hell, Harris?

299
00:19:00.474 --> 00:19:01.475
Reloading!

300
00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.228
-Where's the car?
-Up ahead on the right.

301
00:19:04.353 --> 00:19:05.521
I'll take point.

302
00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:12.986
All call signs, convoy is under attack.
Prep for immediate evac with the asset.

303
00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:27.084
Let's go! Let's go!

304
00:19:29.253 --> 00:19:31.964
All clear! You're clear! Go! Middle car!

305
00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:34.883
-Take him out!
-Contact! Contact!

306
00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:37.511
Get back inside!

307
00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:39.096
Negative. We're leaving.

308
00:19:40.556 --> 00:19:42.391
Mansur, get in there. Get in.

309
00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:45.644
Niesha!

310
00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:48.272
-Niesha!
-No, no, no. Get back in there.

311
00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.107
-Amin!
-Get in the car. Get in the car.

312
00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:53.735
I'm shot! Damn it.

313
00:19:55.863 --> 00:19:56.697
Move!

314
00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.615
Mansur, get back here!

315
00:20:00.826 --> 00:20:02.870
Go! Go! Step on it!

316
00:20:02.953 --> 00:20:04.204
Let's go! Move!

317
00:20:04.288 --> 00:20:06.456
-What about the boss?
-Come on, move!

318
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.293
-Let's move. Protect the asset.
-Go! Go!

319
00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:12.004
Control, this is Cargo 2.
Extraction compromised.

320
00:20:12.129 --> 00:20:14.882
Convoy in contact.
We need immediate assistance.

321
00:20:14.965 --> 00:20:17.593
Cargo 1, this is Cargo 2. Do you copy?

322
00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:20.596
-Comms are down.
-Cell's down too.

323
00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:22.806
What's going on? Who are those people?

324
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.892
You should probably ask your husband that.

325
00:20:24.975 --> 00:20:27.227
I didn't even know we were landing here.
How could I--?

326
00:20:27.311 --> 00:20:30.564
You said she'd be safe.
You promised. I trusted you.

327
00:20:31.857 --> 00:20:34.193
-What's the exfil plan?
-The gate's up ahead.

328
00:20:34.276 --> 00:20:37.070
-How long?
-Two minutes, max. Just keep them--

329
00:20:37.196 --> 00:20:38.405
We got company!

330
00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:40.532
Fuck! They're blocking the road.

331
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.328
-VA nets on the ground.
-Fuck it. Just go through.

332
00:20:44.453 --> 00:20:45.913
They're going to kill us!

333
00:20:45.996 --> 00:20:48.498
This is an armored vehicle. Just stay low.

334
00:20:48.624 --> 00:20:51.001
Give me a spare mag
and I'll go move the net.

335
00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:53.754
Give me a mag and I'll--
Fuck this, I'm moving that net.

336
00:20:53.879 --> 00:20:56.465
-Give it to him.
-Here, take mine. Move fast.

337
00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:57.925
Go. Go. I'll cover you.

338
00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.718
No! Niesha!

339
00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:02.596
I got you!

340
00:21:12.773 --> 00:21:15.734
Covering fire! Go! Go!

341
00:21:17.319 --> 00:21:20.239
Let's go! Go, go, go!

342
00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:26.578
Your team's down. Let's move!

343
00:21:26.662 --> 00:21:29.957
-Go, go! Fucking move!
-Stanwood, drive!

344
00:21:30.499 --> 00:21:31.959
Shit, they're everywhere.

345
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:36.463
Go, go, go. Move! Let's go.

346
00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.131
We can outrun them on the freeway.

347
00:21:38.215 --> 00:21:40.175
Yeah, we gotta make it
to the freeway first.

348
00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:43.011
I'm hit. It's here. It went in here.

349
00:21:43.095 --> 00:21:44.429
Let me see. Let me see.

350
00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:46.431
Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

351
00:21:47.516 --> 00:21:49.518
-Let me see. Move.
-My hands.

352
00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:51.311
-I can help.
-I can't feel my hands.

353
00:21:51.395 --> 00:21:53.689
Hey. Hey. Hold still. Let me help you.

354
00:21:53.772 --> 00:21:56.525
-Back up! Give me some room.
-I'm a doctor, okay?

355
00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:59.736
Let me help you.
We need to find the exit wound.

356
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.654
Yeah.

357
00:22:01.113 --> 00:22:02.322
She has my cuff key.

358
00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:05.617
-You see it?
-No, I can't find it.

359
00:22:05.701 --> 00:22:06.869
-No?
-No.

360
00:22:06.952 --> 00:22:08.996
Yeah? Help me flip her.

361
00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:12.082
We've gotta flip her.
Flip her up, now. Go, go, go.

362
00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:15.627
Here we go. There it is. Shit, that's big.

363
00:22:15.711 --> 00:22:17.671
We need something to stop the bleeding.

364
00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:19.381
Driver, got a med kit?

365
00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:21.675
-Yeah, yeah. I got it.
-Give it to me.

366
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.306
-Here.
-Come on. Come on, let's go.

367
00:22:30.267 --> 00:22:31.476
Get us out of here.

368
00:22:32.603 --> 00:22:34.521
We need some pressure on this.

369
00:22:34.605 --> 00:22:35.606
Roadblock!

370
00:22:36.273 --> 00:22:38.525
-Goddamn it.
-Break right. Break right!

371
00:22:39.193 --> 00:22:40.569
Go. Go. Right, right.

372
00:22:40.652 --> 00:22:42.613
-The glass is bulletproof, right?
-Not forever.

373
00:22:42.696 --> 00:22:44.781
-We need some pressure on this wound.
-I got it. I got it.

374
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.912
Hey. Hey. It's Hooper, right?

375
00:22:49.995 --> 00:22:51.205
Hooper, look at me.

376
00:22:51.288 --> 00:22:52.456
Look at me, Hooper.

377
00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:54.333
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

378
00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:57.252
Just stay calm.
Stay calm. You're gonna be fine.

379
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.214
-Hooper?
-Is she gonna be okay?

380
00:23:00.297 --> 00:23:03.550
We're working on it. Just keep driving.
Losing a lot of blood here.

381
00:23:03.634 --> 00:23:05.636
Hey. Hey, look at me.

382
00:23:05.719 --> 00:23:08.055
Hooper. Hooper.
What's your middle name?

383
00:23:08.138 --> 00:23:10.933
Hooper. Look at me.
What's your middle name?

384
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.895
-Jane.
-Jane. It's good.

385
00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:16.438
That's good. Okay.

386
00:23:18.982 --> 00:23:21.568
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

387
00:23:21.652 --> 00:23:24.196
Stay with us, Hooper.
You're gonna be good.

388
00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:25.989
-We'll get you out.
-Hooper, look at me.

389
00:23:26.114 --> 00:23:27.324
They're cutting us off again.

390
00:23:27.991 --> 00:23:30.619
Follow Cargo 1. Stick together.

391
00:23:30.702 --> 00:23:31.912
Go!

392
00:23:31.995 --> 00:23:35.249
Get us back to the terminal, okay?
Back to the terminal!

393
00:23:35.332 --> 00:23:37.334
-Keep the pressure on.
-I am.

394
00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:40.212
Hooper. Hooper, look at me.
Where did you grow up?

395
00:23:40.295 --> 00:23:42.464
-We're stopping! Brace! Brace!
-No, no, no.

396
00:23:42.548 --> 00:23:44.216
Yeah? Yes?

397
00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:47.261
Why have you stopped?
Keep driving. Why have you stopped?

398
00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:50.806
They're everywhere. They're boxing us in.
We need to follow Marshall.

399
00:23:50.889 --> 00:23:53.058
-We're gonna get you out.
-Is there a clear path?

400
00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:55.018
-Negative. What should we do?
-Niesha.

401
00:23:55.102 --> 00:23:58.647
We can save her.
Get back down here. Hold the wound.

402
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:59.815
Niesha.

403
00:24:02.067 --> 00:24:03.735
That's a grenade. Brace!

404
00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:06.488
-Fuck!
-Holy shit!

405
00:24:06.572 --> 00:24:09.366
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

406
00:24:09.449 --> 00:24:10.450
Hooper.

407
00:24:11.952 --> 00:24:12.911
No.

408
00:24:18.709 --> 00:24:20.752
She's got my cuff keys. Grab them.

409
00:24:20.836 --> 00:24:22.129
Get back. Get back.

410
00:24:22.796 --> 00:24:24.631
Lieutenant,
it's getting a little tight out there.

411
00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:33.390
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Get me out of these.

412
00:24:34.391 --> 00:24:35.392
What are you doing?

413
00:24:35.475 --> 00:24:37.311
-Shut up!
-Harris, get me out of these.

414
00:24:37.394 --> 00:24:39.897
-They're not firing at us.
-Hold position.

415
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.025
These guys here for you?
You know about this?

416
00:24:43.108 --> 00:24:45.611
For the last time, no!
Just get me out of these cuffs.

417
00:24:45.694 --> 00:24:48.447
Hold or move? What do you wanna do?

418
00:24:55.871 --> 00:24:58.665
We need to do something.
There's so many of them.

419
00:24:58.749 --> 00:25:01.668
-Do something!
-Get down. Stay low.

420
00:25:01.752 --> 00:25:05.172
They can't see inside here.
Be quiet. Stay low.

421
00:25:07.925 --> 00:25:09.134
Prepare to breach!

422
00:25:13.847 --> 00:25:15.182
Bring up the crowbar.

423
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.479
-Clear!
-Go! Go, go!

424
00:25:20.562 --> 00:25:21.688
Go! Go!

425
00:25:26.485 --> 00:25:27.444
Man down!

426
00:25:27.528 --> 00:25:29.738
Put it in reverse!
Get us the fuck out of here!

427
00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:37.746
Let's go, let's go!

428
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.331
Go! Go!

429
00:25:45.838 --> 00:25:47.506
Get to the building. I'll cover you.

430
00:25:48.215 --> 00:25:49.842
Get to the building now!

431
00:25:49.967 --> 00:25:51.301
Go, go!

432
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:53.971
Go, go!

433
00:25:54.513 --> 00:25:56.014
Do not shoot Mansur!

434
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.856
-Move!
-Where do we go?

435
00:26:05.023 --> 00:26:07.067
There. Dial 911, quick.

436
00:26:08.193 --> 00:26:09.820
-Undo my cuffs, please.
-No.

437
00:26:09.903 --> 00:26:12.364
We need to make it back
inside the terminal. Go. Come on.

438
00:26:13.323 --> 00:26:15.242
-It won't connect.
-Keep trying.

439
00:26:15.784 --> 00:26:18.620
Who were those people
and why were they already in the airport?

440
00:26:18.704 --> 00:26:20.622
It's like they were waiting for us.

441
00:26:20.706 --> 00:26:22.749
-Getting anything?
-Can they block the phones?

442
00:26:22.833 --> 00:26:24.168
Military-grade gear can, yeah.

443
00:26:24.251 --> 00:26:26.378
What? Are you saying
these people are military?

444
00:26:26.503 --> 00:26:29.256
Whoever they are, they're pros.
They won't stop till they find us.

445
00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:33.135
Right. We should shelter here
and wait for the cavalry, yeah?

446
00:26:33.218 --> 00:26:35.721
-Cavalry ain't coming.
-You don't know that.

447
00:26:35.846 --> 00:26:37.931
Standard response time
for the airport tac team

448
00:26:38.015 --> 00:26:39.391
is seven minutes max.

449
00:26:39.474 --> 00:26:41.977
It's nine already,
and I don't hear any sirens. Do you?

450
00:26:42.102 --> 00:26:45.355
The phones are down, so I'm guessing
the airport cops are down too.

451
00:26:45.439 --> 00:26:48.192
-Whoever they are, they want you bad.
-This way!

452
00:26:48.859 --> 00:26:50.319
Go. Upstairs.

453
00:26:50.444 --> 00:26:51.987
Move. Get up there.

454
00:26:54.948 --> 00:26:57.034
-There must be another way up.
-Go.

455
00:27:06.585 --> 00:27:07.586
With me.

456
00:27:09.129 --> 00:27:10.464
I'll cut them off down here.

457
00:27:21.183 --> 00:27:22.184
Clear?

458
00:27:50.629 --> 00:27:52.005
Anyone got eyes on?

459
00:27:52.089 --> 00:27:53.173
Three targets.

460
00:27:58.387 --> 00:27:59.805
Over here. This way!

461
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:02.891
Stay quiet.

462
00:28:20.492 --> 00:28:22.411
This place is a fucking maze.

463
00:28:59.865 --> 00:29:01.575
Come on. Come on, come on.

464
00:29:02.201 --> 00:29:03.202
Come on.

465
00:29:18.884 --> 00:29:19.885
Come on.

466
00:29:23.555 --> 00:29:24.556
Come on.

467
00:29:34.233 --> 00:29:35.275
Go, go.

468
00:29:51.458 --> 00:29:53.502
-Got him!
-No, no, no!

469
00:29:53.585 --> 00:29:55.838
I'll tell you anything you need to know,
just don't hurt her.

470
00:29:55.921 --> 00:29:57.589
-Please.
-Please, please.

471
00:29:58.465 --> 00:30:00.259
Amin Mansur, you're coming with me.

472
00:30:00.342 --> 00:30:02.594
I'll tell you anything you need,
just don't touch her.

473
00:30:02.678 --> 00:30:04.930
-Move! Both of you! Now!
-No, no, no!

474
00:30:05.013 --> 00:30:06.181
I said, move!

475
00:30:12.396 --> 00:30:13.397
No!

476
00:30:29.788 --> 00:30:30.789
Okay?

477
00:30:42.342 --> 00:30:44.261
Doesn't exactly fit the profile.

478
00:30:52.811 --> 00:30:54.563
Farbridge. Fuck.

479
00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.528
-Please...
-They want you alive. Why?

480
00:31:02.279 --> 00:31:03.363
I don't know.

481
00:31:04.489 --> 00:31:07.868
How many more people have to die today
before you tell me where the bomb is?

482
00:31:07.993 --> 00:31:10.787
-Tell me!
-Please stop! You're hurting him!

483
00:31:10.871 --> 00:31:12.664
-Please!
-I don't give a shit.

484
00:31:12.748 --> 00:31:15.667
I'll kill you if you don't tell me,
I swear to God. Where is it?!

485
00:31:16.919 --> 00:31:19.505
Please, please, Amin,
tell him what he needs.

486
00:31:19.588 --> 00:31:21.256
No chance. And then he cuts us loose.

487
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.926
The only reason he's protecting us
is because of what I know.

488
00:31:27.054 --> 00:31:28.055
Is it--?

489
00:31:30.432 --> 00:31:31.433
Is it true?

490
00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:33.852
We're expendable?

491
00:31:35.604 --> 00:31:39.274
Your husband put a dirty bomb in D.C.
We're all fucking expendable.

492
00:31:40.317 --> 00:31:41.944
-Move.
-Oh, my God.

493
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.249
Okay. Give me your hands.

494
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.801
Thank you.

495
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.220
Don't fuck with me.

496
00:32:24.945 --> 00:32:25.946
Wait.

497
00:32:27.281 --> 00:32:29.825
-Wait, wait. Put it on Niesha.
-Shut up.

498
00:32:29.908 --> 00:32:31.994
-Please, put it on Niesha.
-Shut up!

499
00:32:39.209 --> 00:32:40.669
See that guy down there?

500
00:32:41.211 --> 00:32:42.921
He's wearing a tactical vest.

501
00:32:43.005 --> 00:32:45.382
Take it off, put it on your wife,

502
00:32:45.465 --> 00:32:47.384
-make yourself fucking useful.
-Okay.

503
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:50.095
Got anything?

504
00:32:55.893 --> 00:32:57.394
No blood. Nothing.

505
00:32:57.519 --> 00:33:01.190
All right, you two, stay here.
You stay low. I'll be back in a minute.

506
00:33:08.447 --> 00:33:09.448
Oh, God.

507
00:33:11.992 --> 00:33:13.827
-Here, put this on.
-Yeah, okay.

508
00:33:13.911 --> 00:33:15.037
-Put this on.
-Okay.

509
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.624
Like this, like this.

510
00:33:20.959 --> 00:33:22.377
There. Do the other one.

511
00:33:32.179 --> 00:33:34.473
Amin. Please. Please don't--

512
00:33:35.182 --> 00:33:37.601
-I know what I'm doing.
-Please--

513
00:33:38.977 --> 00:33:40.270
Come on, come on.

514
00:33:41.104 --> 00:33:42.105
Come on.

515
00:33:44.024 --> 00:33:45.442
This way. On me.

516
00:33:46.109 --> 00:33:48.111
Let's go. Go, go, go.

517
00:33:53.367 --> 00:33:54.368
Go.

518
00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.373
Stay close.

519
00:34:09.758 --> 00:34:10.801
Keep sweeping.

520
00:34:13.011 --> 00:34:15.597
-No, no, no. Back this way. Dead end.
-Clear!

521
00:34:17.808 --> 00:34:18.809
Clear!

522
00:34:21.854 --> 00:34:22.855
Don't see them.

523
00:34:23.939 --> 00:34:25.190
Is that area clear?

524
00:34:25.274 --> 00:34:26.900
-Check down there!
-On it!

525
00:34:38.745 --> 00:34:40.706
You, any sign of the target?

526
00:34:40.789 --> 00:34:41.915
No, boss.

527
00:34:41.999 --> 00:34:43.292
We're wasting time.

528
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.212
We don't have enough manpower
to search every crate.

529
00:34:47.296 --> 00:34:48.505
No Mansur, no code.

530
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:51.341
-No code, no package.
-You think I don't know that?

531
00:34:51.425 --> 00:34:52.551
-Clear!
-Clear!

532
00:34:52.634 --> 00:34:54.595
Tech should be online upstairs by now.

533
00:34:54.678 --> 00:34:57.055
We use the airport CCTV to locate him.

534
00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.391
This is on you. You fucked up.

535
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.936
Jackson's gonna tear you a new one.

536
00:35:03.896 --> 00:35:05.189
Get the elevator.

537
00:35:05.272 --> 00:35:07.441
He's already pissed off
it's turned out this way.

538
00:35:08.734 --> 00:35:10.861
You know, you think you're all that.

539
00:35:11.403 --> 00:35:14.781
But I remember Jackson having to pull
your ass out of that last scrape.

540
00:35:15.908 --> 00:35:17.618
Totally different situation.

541
00:35:23.957 --> 00:35:27.252
You know private contracts only get paid
if the job's successful, right?

542
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.546
We're professional soldiers.

543
00:35:30.172 --> 00:35:31.632
Get your shit together.

544
00:35:31.715 --> 00:35:33.675
What I know is
I've got one of the best records

545
00:35:33.759 --> 00:35:35.719
in both Corps and Farbridge.

546
00:35:35.802 --> 00:35:40.057
Improvise, adapt, overcome.
Don't you fucking worry about me.

547
00:35:41.767 --> 00:35:42.893
I got this.

548
00:35:48.023 --> 00:35:51.401
How hard is it
to find one handcuffed terrorist?

549
00:35:51.485 --> 00:35:54.029
-Which of you went early?
-I tried to get--

550
00:35:54.112 --> 00:35:55.906
Charlie team got into a fight
at the terminal.

551
00:35:55.989 --> 00:35:58.784
-Hey, we didn't have a choice!
-We lost the element of surprise.

552
00:35:58.909 --> 00:36:01.453
The president takes the stage
in 90 minutes.

553
00:36:01.537 --> 00:36:03.121
We need to find Mansur.

554
00:36:03.205 --> 00:36:04.206
Jackson!

555
00:36:05.249 --> 00:36:06.708
We own the CCTV.

556
00:36:07.292 --> 00:36:10.003
-All recording devices have been cut.
-Copy.

557
00:36:15.759 --> 00:36:17.719
Give me an update on the site capture.

558
00:36:19.221 --> 00:36:21.890
We own the control tower,
the apron, and the terminal.

559
00:36:22.599 --> 00:36:24.393
Vehicle-mounted jammers are in place.

560
00:36:24.852 --> 00:36:27.563
We got a site-wide blackout on comms.
The whole airport's dark.

561
00:36:27.646 --> 00:36:30.607
-Any response from local law enforcement?
-Not that we know of.

562
00:36:30.691 --> 00:36:33.026
TV news says
there's a natural gas leak at the airport.

563
00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.862
Everyone's staying the fuck away.

564
00:36:34.945 --> 00:36:36.238
How many casualties?

565
00:36:37.072 --> 00:36:40.784
Double what we expected,
but we have about 40 men left, sir.

566
00:36:42.369 --> 00:36:45.706
Very well.
Let's make sure there's no more fuckups.

567
00:36:46.248 --> 00:36:47.374
And, Dunbar...

568
00:36:48.625 --> 00:36:50.127
save the "sir" shit.

569
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:51.545
We ain't in uniform.

570
00:36:52.671 --> 00:36:54.756
You, where's the manager?

571
00:36:55.382 --> 00:36:57.551
-You, get up!
-This guy says he's the COO.

572
00:37:00.012 --> 00:37:03.599
-Are you the man in charge?
-I'm the chief operating officer.

573
00:37:03.682 --> 00:37:07.102
I oversee
all of the day-to-day operations.

574
00:37:07.186 --> 00:37:11.607
So you instructed your people
to share with us the cargo manifest?

575
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:15.527
Yes. But without a serial number,
you won't find anything.

576
00:37:17.696 --> 00:37:21.074
This airport handles
51 million pounds of freight a month.

577
00:37:22.367 --> 00:37:24.870
All those metal boxes
look exactly the same.

578
00:37:24.953 --> 00:37:26.914
You let us worry about that.

579
00:37:26.997 --> 00:37:27.998
Bring him with.

580
00:37:31.877 --> 00:37:33.587
-What's happening?
-Shut up.

581
00:37:37.424 --> 00:37:38.717
Status?

582
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.803
I'm in the security intranet.
Got eyes on the whole airport.

583
00:37:42.679 --> 00:37:43.680
Show me.

584
00:37:44.389 --> 00:37:47.976
Perimeter gates are locked tight.
Nothing's getting in or out.

585
00:37:49.645 --> 00:37:52.439
Jammers operational.
All teams are in position.

586
00:37:57.611 --> 00:37:59.655
Looks like some of the CIA guys survived.

587
00:38:00.781 --> 00:38:01.782
They're in...

588
00:38:03.325 --> 00:38:05.536
-Red 4.
-I'll get a team on it.

589
00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:09.331
No, they're not the priority.
We need to find Mansur.

590
00:38:14.294 --> 00:38:15.295
Where is that?

591
00:38:16.421 --> 00:38:19.049
I'm not sure.
It could be the service stairwell.

592
00:38:19.132 --> 00:38:21.468
-You! Where is that?
-The camera isn't labeled.

593
00:38:25.389 --> 00:38:26.890
He asked you a question.

594
00:38:27.015 --> 00:38:29.643
It's-- It's on this level.

595
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.229
Round the back, I think.

596
00:38:32.312 --> 00:38:35.482
I could show you.
I can take you, if you want.

597
00:38:35.566 --> 00:38:36.567
I got this.

598
00:38:37.067 --> 00:38:38.485
No more fuckups, right?

599
00:38:40.195 --> 00:38:42.447
-Let's go, man.
-Okay.

600
00:38:45.284 --> 00:38:47.995
Wait. Campbell, you go with him.

601
00:38:48.745 --> 00:38:52.332
You bring Mansur
straight to cargo loading on the apron.

602
00:38:52.416 --> 00:38:54.418
I'll be there preparing the exfil.

603
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.422
Go. Move.

604
00:38:58.505 --> 00:39:00.340
Attention, all passengers.

605
00:39:01.258 --> 00:39:03.760
No, it's this way. This way.

606
00:39:05.304 --> 00:39:07.556
Please remain calm and have a great day.

607
00:39:07.681 --> 00:39:10.809
Give me a second to use my keycard. Okay.

608
00:39:14.062 --> 00:39:16.732
That's strange.
There's no cinder blocks in this one.

609
00:39:19.443 --> 00:39:22.446
No, this isn't right. I think--

610
00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.950
Are you dicking me around?

611
00:39:27.034 --> 00:39:28.911
No, no. It's--

612
00:39:28.994 --> 00:39:32.164
It's not here. It's just--
It's around the other side.

613
00:39:32.247 --> 00:39:34.666
I-- I made a mistake. Okay?

614
00:39:34.791 --> 00:39:38.128
Sorry. I don't wanna die. Okay?

615
00:39:38.212 --> 00:39:40.380
I'll show you, okay? I'll show you.

616
00:39:40.464 --> 00:39:41.924
-Better show me something.
-Okay.

617
00:39:46.303 --> 00:39:47.304
Follow me.

618
00:39:48.805 --> 00:39:50.516
What the fuck are you doing back here?

619
00:39:51.266 --> 00:39:52.976
He's saying it's around the other side.

620
00:39:54.228 --> 00:39:56.230
And, you, come on, hands up.

621
00:39:57.189 --> 00:39:58.774
What about these hostages?

622
00:39:59.483 --> 00:40:00.484
It's clear.

623
00:40:05.531 --> 00:40:06.532
That was close.

624
00:40:19.086 --> 00:40:21.004
-I need a minute.
-Are you okay?

625
00:40:21.088 --> 00:40:23.006
No, no, no. We can't stay here.

626
00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.299
Wait, please.

627
00:40:25.008 --> 00:40:26.134
Just for a minute.

628
00:40:34.518 --> 00:40:36.770
-Here, drink this.
-I'm fine.

629
00:40:37.813 --> 00:40:40.148
You need to drink something.
The baby needs--

630
00:40:40.232 --> 00:40:41.525
I said, I'm fine.

631
00:40:42.359 --> 00:40:44.278
You've got to keep your voices down.

632
00:40:44.361 --> 00:40:45.362
Hold on!

633
00:40:48.532 --> 00:40:52.619
Okay, listen to me.
You need to level with me right now.

634
00:40:52.703 --> 00:40:54.621
If you want me to keep you both alive,

635
00:40:54.705 --> 00:40:57.833
you need to tell me who those people are
and why they're after you.

636
00:41:00.544 --> 00:41:04.131
Amin, tell him what he needs to know.

637
00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.302
I don't know anything, I told you.

638
00:41:11.263 --> 00:41:14.057
Amin. Please.

639
00:41:15.267 --> 00:41:16.268
For me?

640
00:41:18.604 --> 00:41:19.605
Please?

641
00:41:25.611 --> 00:41:28.697
I don't know who those people are
or what they're doing here.

642
00:41:33.952 --> 00:41:36.038
The shipping container was just a decoy.

643
00:41:39.249 --> 00:41:41.084
I had a feeling
that I was being watched...

644
00:41:42.503 --> 00:41:45.923
so I changed the delivery method
to cover my tracks.

645
00:41:49.343 --> 00:41:52.554
-Anybody else know about this?
-No.

646
00:41:53.347 --> 00:41:56.350
I swear, I kept it a secret.
I didn't even tell my handler.

647
00:41:57.434 --> 00:41:58.519
Your handler?

648
00:41:59.895 --> 00:42:01.438
They took care of logistics.

649
00:42:02.731 --> 00:42:07.027
They put the cell together, bankrolled us.
They even chose the target.

650
00:42:08.612 --> 00:42:11.907
I got arrested before I had a chance
to tell them that I changed things around.

651
00:42:12.449 --> 00:42:13.450
I need a name.

652
00:42:16.119 --> 00:42:18.247
It was just a voice down the phone.

653
00:42:19.289 --> 00:42:21.834
I swear to you,
we did everything remotely.

654
00:42:24.211 --> 00:42:26.255
I don't know you anymore, Amin.

655
00:42:34.805 --> 00:42:39.518
I did all of this for our son.

656
00:42:42.938 --> 00:42:44.398
You did it for yourself.

657
00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:46.650
All right, we need to keep moving.

658
00:42:46.733 --> 00:42:49.653
Marshall and the agency team,
they made it back to the departure gates.

659
00:42:49.778 --> 00:42:52.281
-They're probably gonna be looking for us.
-But wait, wait.

660
00:42:52.364 --> 00:42:53.991
Can we even trust them?

661
00:42:54.616 --> 00:42:58.328
They're the CIA.
Why wouldn't we trust them?

662
00:42:58.412 --> 00:43:01.123
No one knew
that our flight was landing here.

663
00:43:02.791 --> 00:43:04.376
Somebody had to tell them.

664
00:43:06.295 --> 00:43:07.963
I'm right, aren't I?

665
00:43:10.799 --> 00:43:11.800
Let's go.

666
00:43:30.694 --> 00:43:33.155
Okay. I swear, there was a stairwell here.

667
00:43:33.238 --> 00:43:36.200
Bullshit! We ain't gonna find shit
without squad comms.

668
00:43:36.283 --> 00:43:37.910
We need eyes and ears.

669
00:43:37.993 --> 00:43:40.287
Jackson said
he wants the site to stay dark.

670
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:43.957
I say we put a bullet in his head.
Might improve his memory.

671
00:43:44.041 --> 00:43:46.418
Please, I just-- I got confused.

672
00:43:46.502 --> 00:43:48.587
You're the goddamn airport COO.

673
00:43:49.087 --> 00:43:53.842
I just took the job last month. I sit
at a desk. I'm still learning the layout.

674
00:43:55.636 --> 00:43:57.554
How many stairwells in this terminal?

675
00:43:58.889 --> 00:43:59.890
A few.

676
00:44:00.432 --> 00:44:02.726
I hate this hide-and-seek bullshit.

677
00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:05.270
-You don't know?
-Let's try this way.

678
00:44:05.354 --> 00:44:07.439
-There's Campbell.
-You, stay there.

679
00:44:07.523 --> 00:44:09.316
-Hey, Campbell.
-I got a map in my office.

680
00:44:09.399 --> 00:44:10.859
-All cleared here.
-Just stay there.

681
00:44:10.943 --> 00:44:12.528
Make sure nobody doubles back on us.

682
00:44:12.611 --> 00:44:14.112
-Yes, sir.
-Sir.

683
00:44:14.238 --> 00:44:16.615
You head that way.
I'll check that stairwell again.

684
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:28.293
Which teams are sweeping where?

685
00:44:28.377 --> 00:44:30.671
Alpha are clearing services
and engineering.

686
00:44:30.754 --> 00:44:33.423
Bravo swept the main halls
and are in storage now.

687
00:44:33.507 --> 00:44:35.509
Delta are on their way
through the rail system,

688
00:44:35.592 --> 00:44:37.261
then on the office block.

689
00:44:37.344 --> 00:44:40.055
The rest are accompanying Jackson
to the cargo bay.

690
00:44:40.138 --> 00:44:43.058
-We haven't checked the staff rooms?
-No, not yet.

691
00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:44.226
Well, get on that.

692
00:44:44.768 --> 00:44:47.020
And, you, what use are you?

693
00:44:47.646 --> 00:44:49.898
-Shit.
-Sorry, how about we go one level lower

694
00:44:49.982 --> 00:44:51.859
and check the staff room area?

695
00:44:54.236 --> 00:44:55.362
That's gotta be it.

696
00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.742
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

697
00:45:00.826 --> 00:45:03.745
Look, I'm telling you,
this is a wild-goose chase.

698
00:45:04.746 --> 00:45:06.832
-I think you're right.
-So we're done here?

699
00:45:06.915 --> 00:45:08.792
Yeah. Wait, no.

700
00:45:09.668 --> 00:45:10.669
Please don't--!

701
00:45:11.211 --> 00:45:12.796
-There!
-Move, move!

702
00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.590
Mansur! Don't move!

703
00:45:17.217 --> 00:45:19.094
-Hold your fire!
-On me.

704
00:45:24.391 --> 00:45:27.227
Get after them!
We've got to keep Mansur alive.

705
00:45:29.104 --> 00:45:31.023
Get him! Get him! Get him!

706
00:45:39.198 --> 00:45:41.450
Come on. Come on, you can do it.

707
00:45:47.372 --> 00:45:49.666
-It's locked. Can't go in.
-We need a keycard.

708
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:51.293
-Come on, open!
-No.

709
00:45:52.085 --> 00:45:54.838
They're coming.
They're coming. They're coming.

710
00:45:57.633 --> 00:45:59.676
-Move!
-We need the keycard!

711
00:46:00.802 --> 00:46:01.803
Shit.

712
00:46:03.263 --> 00:46:05.182
Behind me! Behind me!

713
00:46:05.265 --> 00:46:06.266
Moving up.

714
00:46:08.352 --> 00:46:10.395
-Quick, quick, quick!
-Do not kill Mansur!

715
00:46:16.401 --> 00:46:17.486
Go, go, go!

716
00:46:18.153 --> 00:46:19.196
Move!

717
00:46:31.375 --> 00:46:32.793
What do we do?! What do we do?!

718
00:46:32.918 --> 00:46:35.587
-Move this.
-Release the brakes. Use your foot.

719
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:36.672
Come on!

720
00:46:38.173 --> 00:46:40.217
Go, go, go!

721
00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.426
Go, go, go!

722
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.271
Give him up and we'll let you go.

723
00:46:53.397 --> 00:46:54.398
Shit.

724
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:58.277
Go, go!

725
00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.237
-Wait! Give me the gun!
-I need it.

726
00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.321
Hey!

727
00:47:01.989 --> 00:47:04.199
-Fuck.
-Throw down your weapon!

728
00:47:04.783 --> 00:47:07.828
I'm gonna give you
until the count of three,

729
00:47:07.911 --> 00:47:09.913
two, one!

730
00:47:19.882 --> 00:47:20.883
Take him out!

731
00:47:37.065 --> 00:47:38.358
Dunbar, shoot him!

732
00:47:38.442 --> 00:47:39.484
Shoot him!

733
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:47.868
Motherfucker, stop!

734
00:47:49.036 --> 00:47:50.412
I said, stop!

735
00:47:50.495 --> 00:47:51.955
Fuck! Put him down.

736
00:47:59.922 --> 00:48:02.299
Don't come any closer!
Don't come any closer!

737
00:48:06.178 --> 00:48:08.180
He's dead. Give me the gun.

738
00:48:08.263 --> 00:48:11.391
-They're coming. Give me the gun!
-CIA! Get Mansur up here! We'll cover you!

739
00:48:11.475 --> 00:48:13.519
-Move, move!
-Move, move!

740
00:48:13.602 --> 00:48:14.895
Get moving! Go!

741
00:48:16.813 --> 00:48:17.814
Come on!

742
00:48:18.565 --> 00:48:20.025
Covering fire!

743
00:48:20.776 --> 00:48:23.820
Come on! Come on! Come on!

744
00:48:23.904 --> 00:48:25.030
-Come on!
-Come on!

745
00:48:25.113 --> 00:48:26.990
Move, move, move! Get in here!

746
00:48:27.449 --> 00:48:28.283
Get in. Go!

747
00:48:28.367 --> 00:48:32.287
I need you to eliminate
all those airport security cameras.

748
00:48:32.371 --> 00:48:33.205
Yes, sir.

749
00:48:33.288 --> 00:48:35.832
And get an extra man
on the south concourse.

750
00:48:35.958 --> 00:48:36.959
Yes, sir.

751
00:48:37.918 --> 00:48:40.212
Is this it? Is this secure?

752
00:48:41.547 --> 00:48:46.051
Well, lieutenant,
it's not the Maginot Line or the Alamo,

753
00:48:46.134 --> 00:48:48.011
but it's all we got.

754
00:48:48.095 --> 00:48:50.013
-They've pulled back.
-All right.

755
00:48:50.097 --> 00:48:52.057
You keep eyes on that position.

756
00:48:54.101 --> 00:48:55.352
Are you okay?

757
00:48:55.435 --> 00:48:57.688
You need to sit down. Sit down.

758
00:48:58.355 --> 00:48:59.481
I'm gonna help out.

759
00:49:00.941 --> 00:49:02.401
Hey, hey.

760
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:05.153
You need talk to me.

761
00:49:05.237 --> 00:49:08.448
If you really love her,
then you need to talk to me.

762
00:49:08.532 --> 00:49:11.285
You think those people down there
give a shit if she lives or dies?

763
00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:13.745
What, and you do?

764
00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.957
The only thing I care about
is stopping that bomb.

765
00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.918
If you tell me where it is,
then I guarantee you,

766
00:49:20.002 --> 00:49:21.503
I will get her out of here alive.

767
00:49:21.587 --> 00:49:23.130
But you need to talk to me.

768
00:49:30.012 --> 00:49:31.013
Amin...

769
00:49:35.017 --> 00:49:36.018
Son of a bitch.

770
00:49:37.853 --> 00:49:38.854
Hey.

771
00:49:40.105 --> 00:49:41.106
Okay, sorry.

772
00:49:42.107 --> 00:49:43.859
I can help you. Let me see.

773
00:49:43.942 --> 00:49:45.652
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

774
00:49:46.278 --> 00:49:47.863
She's an ER doctor.

775
00:49:48.405 --> 00:49:49.406
Tweezers.

776
00:49:50.908 --> 00:49:51.909
Okay.

777
00:49:53.994 --> 00:49:56.371
Yeah, there's definitely
some debris in here.

778
00:49:57.748 --> 00:50:00.792
-Do you have any pain meds?
-We don't.

779
00:50:01.502 --> 00:50:03.921
Just this. Single malt.

780
00:50:04.796 --> 00:50:06.089
-Is that all right?
-Yes.

781
00:50:13.096 --> 00:50:14.973
-Okay, do you have saline?
-Yeah, we do.

782
00:50:15.057 --> 00:50:16.058
No, I can't.

783
00:50:16.141 --> 00:50:17.893
-Right. Sorry.
-Here.

784
00:50:19.228 --> 00:50:20.229
Thanks.

785
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.857
-Can you bandage this for me?
-Yes.

786
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.818
-Fuck.
-I know, I know.

787
00:50:28.862 --> 00:50:30.739
Okay. Just gonna bandage it.

788
00:50:30.822 --> 00:50:33.617
-Keep pressure on it, right?
-Yeah.

789
00:50:36.161 --> 00:50:37.162
Thank you.

790
00:50:41.333 --> 00:50:42.334
What's going on?

791
00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:45.796
-I think they're broken.
-Let me check it.

792
00:50:47.339 --> 00:50:48.924
It's probably gonna hurt. Okay?

793
00:50:52.052 --> 00:50:53.053
I know.

794
00:50:58.517 --> 00:50:59.560
What are you looking at?

795
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:05.023
Forgot what a good doctor you are...

796
00:51:06.859 --> 00:51:08.610
how many lives you've saved.

797
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:12.823
It's not like anybody's keeping score.

798
00:51:14.825 --> 00:51:17.828
I don't think it's broken,
but it's definitely bruised.

799
00:51:17.911 --> 00:51:20.539
-Okay.
-We don't have any more painkillers.

800
00:51:21.456 --> 00:51:22.457
Okay.

801
00:51:27.504 --> 00:51:29.298
I killed a man downstairs.

802
00:51:33.218 --> 00:51:34.386
I shot him dead.

803
00:51:36.763 --> 00:51:38.265
You saved a man too.

804
00:51:45.105 --> 00:51:46.899
No one's gonna remember that.

805
00:51:48.483 --> 00:51:50.611
He already thinks I'm a terrorist.

806
00:51:52.446 --> 00:51:54.615
Then show him who you really are.

807
00:51:57.159 --> 00:51:58.702
Hey. Sorry. Excuse me.

808
00:51:59.328 --> 00:52:02.247
Can I have some help, please, over here?
Thank you.

809
00:52:09.505 --> 00:52:11.632
-Hey, I'm out.
-That's the last of it.

810
00:52:12.174 --> 00:52:13.425
Make it count.

811
00:52:13.509 --> 00:52:16.303
-Lieutenant Harris, can we talk?
-Yeah.

812
00:52:17.262 --> 00:52:20.182
-How are you doing? How's your arm?
-It's fine.

813
00:52:22.684 --> 00:52:24.603
Has Mansur told you anything yet?

814
00:52:24.686 --> 00:52:28.565
No. He's not going to either.
Not till him and his wife are safe.

815
00:52:28.649 --> 00:52:31.944
The best thing to do is get him
out of this airport to a secure location.

816
00:52:32.027 --> 00:52:34.321
-Then he might talk.
-Right.

817
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.199
Any idea who these people are?

818
00:52:37.991 --> 00:52:40.494
Yeah. I found this on one of them.

819
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:43.622
-Farbridge?
-Yeah.

820
00:52:44.456 --> 00:52:47.626
It's a private military company
out of Fairfax, Virginia.

821
00:52:47.709 --> 00:52:52.256
Guy who owns it, Elliott Carter,
used to be a Navy SEAL.

822
00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:57.427
Right. They supply mercenaries
to sketchy regimes in the Middle East.

823
00:52:57.511 --> 00:53:00.931
Yeah. Also got links
to the intelligence community, so...

824
00:53:05.978 --> 00:53:07.062
One question.

825
00:53:08.188 --> 00:53:10.524
Why wasn't Marshall with you in Poland?

826
00:53:13.652 --> 00:53:17.656
Anderson said his flight was delayed.
Engine trouble or something like that.

827
00:53:17.739 --> 00:53:22.953
Or... Or maybe he just didn't wanna
be there when the shit hit the fan.

828
00:53:23.036 --> 00:53:24.288
Is that what you're thinking?

829
00:53:26.164 --> 00:53:30.043
Only a handful of people knew
you were gonna be there. I think...

830
00:53:32.087 --> 00:53:34.214
Okay, on your feet. We need to talk.

831
00:53:44.099 --> 00:53:46.935
I want you to take a look
at something for me.

832
00:53:48.896 --> 00:53:50.564
This came in earlier today.

833
00:53:51.899 --> 00:53:53.650
Port of Virginia this morning.

834
00:53:54.401 --> 00:53:56.236
Friends of yours, I presume?

835
00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:59.865
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Excuse me. What's going on here?

836
00:54:01.325 --> 00:54:03.660
Agent Lomax.

837
00:54:07.247 --> 00:54:13.378
Your little raid on the container terminal
was unauthorized.

838
00:54:14.296 --> 00:54:18.342
Yeah. I called your superiors
at Homeland this morning.

839
00:54:18.425 --> 00:54:21.220
Your raid was off-book.

840
00:54:22.638 --> 00:54:27.768
We had raw intel on the bomb.
We had to move fast. It was not a secret.

841
00:54:27.851 --> 00:54:32.022
I released the helmet cam footage
as soon as the operation went south.

842
00:54:32.648 --> 00:54:39.279
Wait. You released the footage after
you determined the container was empty.

843
00:54:40.531 --> 00:54:45.536
What would you have done
if the container had the device inside?

844
00:54:46.745 --> 00:54:50.541
I would have brought in a CBRN team
to secure it.

845
00:54:50.624 --> 00:54:52.334
Standard procedure.

846
00:54:53.585 --> 00:54:57.256
What exactly
are you accusing me of, Marshall?

847
00:54:57.923 --> 00:55:00.551
Oh, Special Agent Lomax.

848
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:06.139
-Surrender your weapon.
-Whoa, okay. What are you...?

849
00:55:06.223 --> 00:55:07.766
What's going on? What are you doing?

850
00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:10.227
-Stay out of this, lieutenant.
-Harris.

851
00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:12.646
Surrender your weapon.

852
00:55:15.065 --> 00:55:16.066
Now!

853
00:55:18.652 --> 00:55:20.904
-Marshall.
-Don't let him do this.

854
00:55:20.988 --> 00:55:25.117
All due respect, Marshall,
you need to holster that weapon right now.

855
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.201
It's not here.

856
00:55:36.712 --> 00:55:40.424
-That's you.
-What are you talking about?

857
00:55:43.177 --> 00:55:44.178
It's you.

858
00:55:45.429 --> 00:55:48.849
What is it? What did you see in the video?

859
00:55:50.851 --> 00:55:51.852
Tell me.

860
00:55:54.354 --> 00:55:56.440
The people who coordinated the cell

861
00:55:56.523 --> 00:55:59.860
would call me once a week
to give me instructions.

862
00:56:00.485 --> 00:56:03.822
It was always the same person.
We'd speak on an encrypted line in Arabic.

863
00:56:03.906 --> 00:56:05.908
You already told me about him.
The handler.

864
00:56:05.991 --> 00:56:08.285
No! No, no. Not him. Her.

865
00:56:09.745 --> 00:56:11.705
She said she was from the Gulf...

866
00:56:12.289 --> 00:56:16.043
but your accent would slip,
which always made me suspicious.

867
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:19.922
It would go into more of a Levantine
or Egyptian one.

868
00:56:20.005 --> 00:56:22.049
It's a really distinctive accent. Listen.

869
00:56:26.428 --> 00:56:28.430
So what? I speak Arabic.

870
00:56:28.514 --> 00:56:32.643
It was a part of my fucking training.
I speak Arabic, Farsi, French.

871
00:56:32.726 --> 00:56:35.729
-Hey, are you sure about this?
-Keep your hands up.

872
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:39.233
Amin, you need to be certain about this.

873
00:56:40.776 --> 00:56:44.154
Yes. It's her. I'm telling you, it's her.

874
00:56:44.238 --> 00:56:46.907
This is insane. No!

875
00:56:47.032 --> 00:56:48.992
You were the voice down the phone.

876
00:56:49.618 --> 00:56:53.163
You told me to collect all the materials
to make the bomb and bring it stateside.

877
00:56:53.288 --> 00:56:55.082
You coordinated all of this.

878
00:56:56.583 --> 00:56:58.377
Do you know how crazy this sounds?

879
00:56:58.502 --> 00:57:02.047
You even diverted the plane here.
You know the bomb's here.

880
00:57:03.048 --> 00:57:04.550
Wait. What?

881
00:57:08.011 --> 00:57:09.513
Yeah, I shipped it here.

882
00:57:11.265 --> 00:57:14.893
-The bomb's in the airport.
-No. He's lying. No, he's lying.

883
00:57:14.977 --> 00:57:17.187
-They're coming up. Contact, right.
-Listen to me--

884
00:57:17.312 --> 00:57:18.814
-Come on!
-Stand to!

885
00:57:34.454 --> 00:57:35.664
Niesha!

886
00:57:38.166 --> 00:57:39.168
Amin!

887
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.214
Watch out! Watch out!

888
00:57:45.257 --> 00:57:46.633
Hey! Get down!

889
00:57:49.094 --> 00:57:50.179
Hey, you!

890
00:58:06.028 --> 00:58:09.531
-Amin, where do we go?
-Let's go. Let's go. Come on!

891
00:58:09.615 --> 00:58:11.992
Move. Move, move!

892
00:58:12.576 --> 00:58:14.453
-Move!
-Niesha!

893
00:58:14.536 --> 00:58:17.581
Go, run! Run! Go, go, go!

894
00:58:17.664 --> 00:58:20.167
Hold it right there. I said, stop!

895
00:58:21.418 --> 00:58:23.253
Come here! Come here!

896
00:58:23.337 --> 00:58:25.881
Run! Run, Niesha! Run!

897
00:58:27.216 --> 00:58:28.217
Fuck!

898
00:58:29.051 --> 00:58:33.222
-Give me your hands. Give me your hands!
-Niesha! Run! Run!

899
00:58:45.692 --> 00:58:49.488
-Fuck!
-Stay down! Stay the fuck down!

900
00:58:51.365 --> 00:58:52.824
Get off me. Get off me!

901
00:58:52.908 --> 00:58:55.661
Don't you fucking move,
or I'll kill your wife!

902
00:59:25.274 --> 00:59:28.527
-Well, that was silly.
-Sorry. Please, I didn't mean--

903
00:59:33.323 --> 00:59:36.368
Stay by my fucking side, or she's dead.
Do you hear me?

904
00:59:38.453 --> 00:59:40.163
Anyone else still alive?

905
00:59:41.290 --> 00:59:42.291
Move!

906
00:59:42.374 --> 00:59:43.584
We've got Marshall.

907
00:59:44.626 --> 00:59:45.752
Sit him down.

908
00:59:49.214 --> 00:59:50.215
Look at me.

909
00:59:51.216 --> 00:59:52.342
Look at me.

910
00:59:54.595 --> 00:59:56.346
Do you shave in the morning?

911
00:59:57.014 --> 00:59:58.265
Sometimes. Why?

912
00:59:58.724 --> 01:00:03.353
Well, how in the hell can you even stand
looking at yourself in the mirror?

913
01:00:03.437 --> 01:00:04.521
Here we go.

914
01:00:05.564 --> 01:00:09.860
What's the going rate now
for betraying your country?

915
01:00:09.943 --> 01:00:12.112
Keep it up, asshole. You lost.

916
01:00:12.946 --> 01:00:15.365
Oh, I fucking knew it.

917
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:25.083
-State of the Union starts in 65 minutes.
-You let me worry about that.

918
01:00:25.167 --> 01:00:26.668
Focus on keeping your men in line.

919
01:00:26.752 --> 01:00:29.630
And remind them,
we're on the same fucking side.

920
01:00:34.801 --> 01:00:36.178
Shall we get started?

921
01:00:37.262 --> 01:00:39.181
You, clean the rest of these up.

922
01:00:40.265 --> 01:00:41.350
You, bring him.

923
01:00:43.352 --> 01:00:45.270
-Where are you taking me?
-On your knees!

924
01:00:45.354 --> 01:00:47.731
As soon as we realized
the shipping container was empty,

925
01:00:47.814 --> 01:00:50.067
we rifled through your company's exports.

926
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:53.820
We discovered you sent airfreight here
from Istanbul four days ago.

927
01:00:54.488 --> 01:00:56.406
If you know it's here, why do you need me?

928
01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:57.491
Time.

929
01:00:57.574 --> 01:01:01.328
There are thousands of cargo crates
in this airport, all identical.

930
01:01:01.453 --> 01:01:03.163
We need the serial number.

931
01:01:04.039 --> 01:01:05.207
I don't get it.

932
01:01:07.417 --> 01:01:10.754
Why do you, a Homeland agent,
want to bomb the Capitol?

933
01:01:11.505 --> 01:01:14.049
Do you know what makes
the State of the Union address

934
01:01:14.132 --> 01:01:16.218
a national security nightmare?

935
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.721
Yeah.

936
01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:21.765
Yeah, I do.

937
01:01:22.975 --> 01:01:24.017
You told me.

938
01:01:25.269 --> 01:01:26.395
They're all here.

939
01:01:27.145 --> 01:01:31.984
The most powerful people in America,
all in the same place at the same time.

940
01:01:32.943 --> 01:01:34.069
Exactly.

941
01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:39.575
In the event of a security alert,
the heads of key government agencies

942
01:01:39.658 --> 01:01:42.661
are taken
to separate secure locations in D.C.

943
01:01:42.744 --> 01:01:46.957
But that all changes
if the threat is radioactive.

944
01:01:48.667 --> 01:01:53.672
Protocol for an RDD is to take
key personnel to a single secure site.

945
01:01:55.465 --> 01:01:56.800
Just imagine it.

946
01:01:57.426 --> 01:02:02.014
All the heads of the DOD and the NSA
under the same roof,

947
01:02:02.097 --> 01:02:06.643
while D.C. is thrust into chaos
by a radioactive blast.

948
01:02:07.978 --> 01:02:10.063
You're going to assassinate them?

949
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:14.443
No. I'm gonna fingerprint them.

950
01:02:15.569 --> 01:02:17.738
Their biometric data gives us access

951
01:02:17.821 --> 01:02:21.033
to all of the country's
key strategic defenses.

952
01:02:25.495 --> 01:02:28.790
With it, we will bring the U.S.
to its knees.

953
01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:34.796
Do you have any idea what that is worth
to the right foreign buyer?

954
01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.592
It's just a business deal.

955
01:02:41.053 --> 01:02:44.097
And you wanted
to make it look like a terror attack.

956
01:02:45.098 --> 01:02:46.767
You used me.

957
01:02:47.559 --> 01:02:49.561
We needed the threat to be credible.

958
01:02:49.645 --> 01:02:52.439
Capitol Hill does not get evacuated
on a rumor.

959
01:02:53.482 --> 01:02:58.237
Now, I'm really gonna need
the serial number to that container, Amin.

960
01:03:00.322 --> 01:03:02.199
No? Okay.

961
01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:07.287
You're out of time. Tell me now.

962
01:03:10.082 --> 01:03:11.583
Not the face. The leg.

963
01:03:20.133 --> 01:03:21.718
The serial number!

964
01:03:25.681 --> 01:03:27.641
All right, out of my fucking way.

965
01:03:35.107 --> 01:03:36.567
One more chance.

966
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:40.153
-I need the serial number right now.
-No, no, please! Please don't.

967
01:03:40.237 --> 01:03:42.823
-Will you give me the number?
-Please don't. Please don't!

968
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:55.127
-Give me the number!
-Please, please.

969
01:03:58.964 --> 01:04:01.216
All right. I want everyone
to pull back to the cargo bay.

970
01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.969
Regroup with Jackson on the apron.
Let's get ready to leave.

971
01:04:04.052 --> 01:04:07.389
-He hasn't given us what we need yet.
-Oh, he will.

972
01:04:07.472 --> 01:04:09.266
Tell them to bring in the wife.

973
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:11.268
Let's put that torture training
into action.

974
01:04:11.351 --> 01:04:15.063
-No! No, leave her alone!
-Sit the fuck back down. Get him down.

975
01:04:15.147 --> 01:04:17.858
-You leave her alone! You leave her alone!
-Take his vest off.

976
01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:20.068
Had to make this difficult, didn't you?

977
01:04:22.738 --> 01:04:23.822
Hey, Campbell!

978
01:04:25.991 --> 01:04:28.702
-On me.
-Making a lot of noise in there.

979
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.582
Lomax wants Mansur's wife.

980
01:04:34.249 --> 01:04:36.668
Shit. She got away.

981
01:04:36.752 --> 01:04:39.171
Well, then, you'd better find her, fast.

982
01:04:40.964 --> 01:04:43.008
What? Why the long face?

983
01:04:43.467 --> 01:04:45.552
I thought you liked
playing hide-and-go-seek.

984
01:04:46.136 --> 01:04:49.264
Fuck your mother,
you cocksucking waste of rations.

985
01:04:49.348 --> 01:04:51.225
Hey! Where are you going?

986
01:04:51.308 --> 01:04:54.353
Lomax wants me to gather the troops
and reconnect with Jackson.

987
01:04:54.436 --> 01:04:56.605
Once Mansur talks, we're out of here.

988
01:04:56.688 --> 01:04:58.398
You, with me.

989
01:05:02.819 --> 01:05:04.613
Lack-of-comms bullshit.

990
01:05:06.323 --> 01:05:07.741
Update on Bravo team?

991
01:05:07.824 --> 01:05:08.825
Negative.

992
01:05:08.909 --> 01:05:10.661
Fucking airport.

993
01:05:10.744 --> 01:05:13.789
I swear to God, Jackson needs
to get us double the salary next time.

994
01:05:13.872 --> 01:05:16.416
This evac better be flying us
somewhere with a beach.

995
01:05:17.709 --> 01:05:19.837
She can't have gone far without a keycard.

996
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.588
-Spread out.
-On it.

997
01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:25.861
Get off me!

998
01:06:28.447 --> 01:06:29.948
Yo! You coming?

999
01:06:33.994 --> 01:06:35.746
What the fuck, man?

1000
01:06:38.665 --> 01:06:42.503
-Let me go. Let me go!
-Stop struggling. Fuck.

1001
01:06:42.586 --> 01:06:48.133
-Let me go!
-Where are you? Lomax is waiting. Fuck.

1002
01:06:49.009 --> 01:06:51.303
Shit. Move.

1003
01:06:52.429 --> 01:06:53.430
Move.

1004
01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.885
Stop! I'm gonna shoot.

1005
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:42.271
Stop.

1006
01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:49.862
Stop! Stop!

1007
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:52.030
Stop!

1008
01:07:52.614 --> 01:07:53.657
Stop!

1009
01:08:37.993 --> 01:08:40.370
What...? What are you doing?

1010
01:08:44.041 --> 01:08:45.751
We need to go back upstairs.

1011
01:08:51.798 --> 01:08:52.925
I'm done.

1012
01:08:54.593 --> 01:08:57.137
They're kicking the shit
out of your husband upstairs,

1013
01:08:57.221 --> 01:08:59.014
trying to find out where that bomb is.

1014
01:09:01.016 --> 01:09:02.684
You need to come with me.

1015
01:09:04.353 --> 01:09:05.354
No.

1016
01:09:06.355 --> 01:09:10.150
I can't... I can't help you with this.
There's nothing I can do here.

1017
01:09:10.234 --> 01:09:11.235
Listen!

1018
01:09:12.152 --> 01:09:14.238
A lot of innocent people
are gonna die today,

1019
01:09:14.321 --> 01:09:17.074
including you and your unborn child.

1020
01:09:17.157 --> 01:09:21.286
If that bomb goes off, everybody's dead.
You understand me? Everybody.

1021
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:23.163
The whole of D.C.

1022
01:09:27.626 --> 01:09:29.002
I can't stop this.

1023
01:09:32.089 --> 01:09:36.176
If they get hold of that bomb,
I can't stop this, it's over.

1024
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:40.389
And I can't save your husband
unless you help me.

1025
01:09:42.641 --> 01:09:45.102
Now, I'm begging you, please.

1026
01:09:45.769 --> 01:09:48.522
You help me, yeah? You'll help me?

1027
01:09:48.605 --> 01:09:50.190
All right. All right.

1028
01:09:52.776 --> 01:09:55.946
Okay. Okay. Let's go.

1029
01:09:57.281 --> 01:09:58.323
Hold this.

1030
01:10:17.718 --> 01:10:21.221
That man said...
That man said Lomax was waiting.

1031
01:10:21.305 --> 01:10:25.475
She's supposed to be Homeland Security.
Why is she doing this?

1032
01:10:25.601 --> 01:10:27.352
Lomax has gone rogue.

1033
01:10:27.436 --> 01:10:30.439
She's working
with a company called Farbridge.

1034
01:10:30.522 --> 01:10:34.985
I think she framed your husband,
hiding her agenda under a terror attack.

1035
01:10:35.068 --> 01:10:37.779
Now, don't forget to struggle.
Okay? Let's go.

1036
01:10:38.989 --> 01:10:39.990
Come on!

1037
01:10:43.869 --> 01:10:45.412
Where's Campbell?

1038
01:10:45.495 --> 01:10:49.333
He's dead. SEAL's dead too. Where's Lomax?

1039
01:10:49.416 --> 01:10:51.043
Over there. Side room.

1040
01:10:53.795 --> 01:10:54.796
Damn it.

1041
01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:02.554
They... They got Marshall.

1042
01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:13.065
Hit him again.

1043
01:11:14.316 --> 01:11:17.361
-The number, Amin.
-I don't have it.

1044
01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:18.820
Hit him again.

1045
01:11:19.988 --> 01:11:22.324
-Please, please, please...
-Ah, here she is.

1046
01:11:22.407 --> 01:11:27.538
-No. Stop, please. Please stop. Please.
-I'll take that.

1047
01:11:29.915 --> 01:11:30.958
Please...

1048
01:11:32.334 --> 01:11:35.045
-Niesha! Niesha!
-Amin, don't tell them anything.

1049
01:11:35.128 --> 01:11:37.714
-Niesha!
-Sit down.

1050
01:11:37.798 --> 01:11:41.510
-Just leave her alone.
-Look at me. Not her. Take her vest off.

1051
01:11:41.593 --> 01:11:44.179
What? No. Please. Please don't.

1052
01:11:44.263 --> 01:11:47.850
Please don't. Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

1053
01:11:47.975 --> 01:11:50.602
-Please don't hurt her.
-Trust me.

1054
01:11:50.686 --> 01:11:53.647
Please. Don't be a fucking monster.

1055
01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:57.401
-No! Don't do this! Do not do this!
-The number.

1056
01:11:57.484 --> 01:12:00.362
Please just leave her alone.
Leave her alone!

1057
01:12:00.487 --> 01:12:05.951
-Leave her alone! Just leave her alone.
-How do you feel about losing another son?

1058
01:12:06.034 --> 01:12:08.245
-No, please.
-Give me the number!

1059
01:12:08.328 --> 01:12:10.789
-Please, please, please. Don't!
-Now!

1060
01:12:10.914 --> 01:12:13.250
-Please don't.
-Please don't. Please.

1061
01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:16.128
All right. Hit her in the belly.

1062
01:12:16.753 --> 01:12:17.754
What?

1063
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:21.508
Then give me the number.

1064
01:12:21.592 --> 01:12:24.011
She's pregnant. What are you doing?

1065
01:12:24.094 --> 01:12:25.512
Hit her!

1066
01:12:26.513 --> 01:12:29.016
Please don't hurt my baby. Please!

1067
01:12:29.099 --> 01:12:33.478
I said, hit her!
Amin, give me the fucking number!

1068
01:12:33.562 --> 01:12:37.024
-Please don't fucking do this.
-Give me the fucking number now!

1069
01:12:37.107 --> 01:12:40.777
-Don't do this!
-The fuck are you waiting for? Hit her!

1070
01:12:40.861 --> 01:12:43.197
Nine, zero, two, one, seven.

1071
01:12:47.201 --> 01:12:48.327
Excellent.

1072
01:12:49.912 --> 01:12:51.580
-Did you get the crate number?
-Yeah.

1073
01:12:51.663 --> 01:12:54.166
-Go give it to Jackson.
-You coming?

1074
01:12:54.249 --> 01:12:57.252
After I leave some breadcrumbs
for law enforcement to follow.

1075
01:13:00.589 --> 01:13:01.673
Scissors.

1076
01:13:04.468 --> 01:13:06.178
Let's get you out of these.

1077
01:13:07.804 --> 01:13:09.097
I'm sorry.

1078
01:13:10.807 --> 01:13:12.100
I'm sorry.

1079
01:13:13.977 --> 01:13:15.187
I'm sorry.

1080
01:13:16.605 --> 01:13:17.981
I'm sorry.

1081
01:13:31.745 --> 01:13:32.996
What are you doing?

1082
01:13:34.665 --> 01:13:35.832
What are you doing?

1083
01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:38.001
What are you doing?

1084
01:13:39.753 --> 01:13:44.174
A hundred carefully crafted words
about why you're here.

1085
01:13:52.558 --> 01:13:54.184
I am not reading that.

1086
01:13:55.686 --> 01:13:58.647
It's your very own
State of the Union address.

1087
01:13:58.730 --> 01:14:02.568
Every network
and every news website will run it.

1088
01:14:02.651 --> 01:14:05.946
Isn't this what you wanted?
To avenge your dead son?

1089
01:14:06.029 --> 01:14:07.447
Don't talk about my son.

1090
01:14:07.531 --> 01:14:10.576
Do we need to bring your wife
back into this?

1091
01:14:14.371 --> 01:14:16.832
Then read the damn speech. Get him up.

1092
01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:22.004
-No, don't. Please.
-Don't do it.

1093
01:14:26.717 --> 01:14:29.344
-Don't do it.
-Read it.

1094
01:14:30.053 --> 01:14:31.138
Don't!

1095
01:14:31.805 --> 01:14:34.349
Don't. Don't.

1096
01:14:34.433 --> 01:14:37.936
Don't. Don't.

1097
01:14:38.687 --> 01:14:41.690
Don't look at her. Look at me. Read.

1098
01:14:46.737 --> 01:14:48.822
"My name is Amin Mansur.

1099
01:14:50.657 --> 01:14:52.492
I am a British citizen.

1100
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:58.123
-I have come to Washington, D.C.--"
-No, no, no.

1101
01:14:58.207 --> 01:14:59.583
That is fucking pathetic.

1102
01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:03.420
You're supposed to be
America's worst nightmare. Act like it!

1103
01:15:04.379 --> 01:15:05.422
Again!

1104
01:15:12.012 --> 01:15:14.139
"My name is Amin Mansur.

1105
01:15:15.682 --> 01:15:17.726
I am a British citizen.

1106
01:15:20.354 --> 01:15:22.898
I have come to Washington, D.C...

1107
01:15:25.734 --> 01:15:28.111
for veng--" I'm not reading this.

1108
01:15:36.828 --> 01:15:39.122
Do you remember our phone calls, Amin?

1109
01:15:40.249 --> 01:15:42.793
You told me how your son, how Tariq died.

1110
01:15:42.876 --> 01:15:44.753
Don't fucking say his name.

1111
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:53.512
You told me how you lifted his body
out of the rubble after the airstrike.

1112
01:15:54.721 --> 01:15:59.309
How you held him in your arms
as he drew his last breaths.

1113
01:16:00.185 --> 01:16:05.816
You told me of your guilt,
your anger, and your hate.

1114
01:16:07.317 --> 01:16:09.778
You told me you wanted vengeance.

1115
01:16:12.614 --> 01:16:13.991
Fuck you.

1116
01:16:15.617 --> 01:16:20.831
No! No, no, no! Please, please, please.
I'll read it. I'll read it.

1117
01:16:20.914 --> 01:16:25.669
-Then pick it up.
-I'll read it. I'll read it. I'll read it.

1118
01:16:46.565 --> 01:16:48.609
"My name is Amin Mansur.

1119
01:16:51.028 --> 01:16:53.906
I was a British citizen.

1120
01:16:56.283 --> 01:17:02.039
I have come to Washington, D.C.
for vengeance.

1121
01:17:04.374 --> 01:17:06.126
For too long,

1122
01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:11.757
the crusader coalition
of Britain and America...

1123
01:17:13.383 --> 01:17:19.556
has brought war and destruction
to our lands.

1124
01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:25.687
Now we bring it to yours.

1125
01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:33.987
You will see suffering and death,
just as we have.

1126
01:17:36.114 --> 01:17:38.450
Your children will die,

1127
01:17:39.326 --> 01:17:41.703
just as ours have.

1128
01:17:44.081 --> 01:17:46.375
And you will know our pain,

1129
01:17:46.458 --> 01:17:50.838
as your capital is engulfed in flames."

1130
01:17:59.304 --> 01:18:01.682
Very convincing. Thank you.

1131
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.520
No! Amin!

1132
01:18:09.273 --> 01:18:11.024
Finish up here and meet me by the plane.

1133
01:18:11.108 --> 01:18:13.443
And bring the bodies.
We need them to feed the narrative.

1134
01:18:13.527 --> 01:18:15.112
-With me.
-Yes, ma'am.

1135
01:18:16.613 --> 01:18:18.782
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1136
01:18:18.866 --> 01:18:21.660
-She took my weapon.
-Step aside. I'll do it.

1137
01:18:26.123 --> 01:18:28.834
You're gonna be fine, Amin.
You're gonna be okay.

1138
01:18:34.047 --> 01:18:37.134
Look at me. Look at me.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1139
01:18:37.217 --> 01:18:43.182
-No, no!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1140
01:18:44.349 --> 01:18:45.350
I'm sorry.

1141
01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.561
I'm sorry.

1142
01:19:05.913 --> 01:19:09.416
I can't stop the bleeding.
I can't stop it.

1143
01:19:15.714 --> 01:19:18.675
Don't let my son see the video.

1144
01:19:18.759 --> 01:19:23.430
No, I won't. I won't. I promise I won't.

1145
01:19:26.099 --> 01:19:27.100
No.

1146
01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:35.067
Someone will come.

1147
01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:39.738
Don't go. Please, Harris!

1148
01:19:40.572 --> 01:19:43.242
Harris. Don't go.

1149
01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:46.662
-I have to stop this.
-Please.

1150
01:20:00.634 --> 01:20:02.427
Attention, all passengers.

1151
01:20:02.511 --> 01:20:04.471
Due to unforeseen circumstances,

1152
01:20:04.555 --> 01:20:07.391
it is important
that you find the nearest exit.

1153
01:20:07.474 --> 01:20:10.102
Please remain calm
and have a great day.

1154
01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:14.857
Flight updates will be available
via your carrier.

1155
01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:18.151
Airport staff,
please report to your supervisors.

1156
01:20:36.336 --> 01:20:37.796
Doors opening.

1157
01:20:38.547 --> 01:20:40.174
Hey, you jumping on?

1158
01:20:40.257 --> 01:20:41.550
Yeah, yeah. I am.

1159
01:20:41.633 --> 01:20:44.219
Jackson wants us on the apron.
We're clearing out.

1160
01:20:44.303 --> 01:20:45.846
I'll sweep this carriage.

1161
01:20:57.983 --> 01:20:59.943
-Cargo. End of the line.
-I hear we've got the container.

1162
01:21:00.027 --> 01:21:01.695
We're getting the fuck out of here.

1163
01:21:02.654 --> 01:21:04.823
-All right?
-All good.

1164
01:21:07.868 --> 01:21:09.328
Doors closing.

1165
01:21:12.456 --> 01:21:13.498
Miller?

1166
01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:17.753
Hey, Miller.

1167
01:21:19.630 --> 01:21:21.048
Where's the rest of your team?

1168
01:21:22.007 --> 01:21:23.133
Went on ahead.

1169
01:21:25.844 --> 01:21:27.346
We don't have a Miller on the team.

1170
01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.041
Shoot him!

1171
01:22:48.093 --> 01:22:49.887
-Get the fucking door!
-Move it.

1172
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:51.263
Let's go. Let's go.

1173
01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:57.603
-Dunbar, who is that?
-On me. Let's go!

1174
01:23:01.356 --> 01:23:02.357
You hit him?

1175
01:23:29.968 --> 01:23:33.263
You two, check that stairwell,
then double back. Go.

1176
01:23:33.347 --> 01:23:34.348
Roger that.

1177
01:23:52.407 --> 01:23:54.368
-On my right.
-Copy.

1178
01:24:20.561 --> 01:24:21.562
Bridges.

1179
01:24:23.021 --> 01:24:24.022
Bridges!

1180
01:24:37.995 --> 01:24:39.830
Bridges. Shit. He's close.

1181
01:24:41.039 --> 01:24:42.040
Oh, fuck.

1182
01:24:46.336 --> 01:24:48.922
Hey, boss, we got a tunnel here!

1183
01:24:49.006 --> 01:24:50.007
Check it out.

1184
01:24:53.594 --> 01:24:54.595
Shit.

1185
01:24:55.304 --> 01:24:56.471
Give it up, man.

1186
01:24:57.764 --> 01:24:58.765
You're trapped.

1187
01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.271
-Hey, you see him?
-He's using the tunnels!

1188
01:25:09.693 --> 01:25:10.694
Shit.

1189
01:25:12.404 --> 01:25:14.281
-Go left!
-Moving!

1190
01:25:23.415 --> 01:25:24.708
Check that tunnel!

1191
01:25:29.838 --> 01:25:32.341
-Arms out, weapons up.
-He's not up there!

1192
01:25:32.424 --> 01:25:36.261
We know, he's down here
using the tunnels. I see him!

1193
01:25:38.597 --> 01:25:41.141
-I've got a grenade!
-Post it.

1194
01:25:41.225 --> 01:25:42.935
-Frag out!
-Frag out!

1195
01:26:07.876 --> 01:26:08.877
Fuck.

1196
01:28:37.568 --> 01:28:40.821
-Let's go. Time's ticking.
-Understood.

1197
01:28:45.909 --> 01:28:47.786
-Push harder back there.
-Yes, boss.

1198
01:29:08.974 --> 01:29:11.059
You sweep the site of all our guys?

1199
01:29:11.143 --> 01:29:13.187
We're waiting
for Campbell and Dunbar's team.

1200
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:15.981
-Other than that, we leave no trace.
-Copy.

1201
01:29:17.357 --> 01:29:18.358
Easy.

1202
01:29:21.778 --> 01:29:24.239
All right. We got it.

1203
01:29:25.949 --> 01:29:28.285
All right. Check the container.
Make sure it's viable.

1204
01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:31.288
-Give me radiation levels.
-It's slightly above normal.

1205
01:29:31.371 --> 01:29:33.290
-Hey, help me with these.
-Yeah, I got you.

1206
01:29:33.373 --> 01:29:34.374
Here you go.

1207
01:29:44.092 --> 01:29:45.677
Yeah, there she is.

1208
01:29:47.304 --> 01:29:48.805
Well? Confirm status.

1209
01:29:49.389 --> 01:29:52.434
You got about a meter and a half
to safety radius here,

1210
01:29:52.518 --> 01:29:55.145
but it's definitely radioactive.

1211
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:57.981
I'll go ahead and hook it up
to the cell phone.

1212
01:29:58.065 --> 01:30:00.734
-Transfer it to the ambulance.
-Yep. Roger.

1213
01:30:22.172 --> 01:30:23.674
Time to get ready.

1214
01:30:23.757 --> 01:30:24.800
Finally.

1215
01:30:26.844 --> 01:30:28.637
How long until we can go up?

1216
01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.473
Pre-flight check is done.
We can be in the air in five minutes.

1217
01:30:31.557 --> 01:30:32.558
Do it.

1218
01:30:34.351 --> 01:30:37.312
Take jammers 2 and 3 offline.
I need to call it in.

1219
01:30:58.292 --> 01:31:01.086
I'll get that. You get the jammers.

1220
01:31:22.816 --> 01:31:23.650
Mulholland.

1221
01:31:23.734 --> 01:31:26.486
Admiral Mulholland, this is
Lieutenant Jake Harris, do you read?

1222
01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:28.405
Harris? Where the hell are you?

1223
01:31:28.488 --> 01:31:31.575
I'm on the tarmac
of Washington Baltimore Airport.

1224
01:31:31.658 --> 01:31:33.952
They've loaded the device
into the back of an ambulance.

1225
01:31:34.036 --> 01:31:35.329
Jesus. Are you sure?

1226
01:31:35.412 --> 01:31:36.663
Yes, sir, I'm sure.

1227
01:31:36.747 --> 01:31:40.292
And this isn't just a terrorist attack.
This is something more than that.

1228
01:31:40.375 --> 01:31:45.506
Agent Lomax of the Homeland Security,
she's running a rogue operation.

1229
01:31:45.589 --> 01:31:49.218
Repeat. She's running a rogue operation.
You need to contact...

1230
01:31:51.637 --> 01:31:54.014
Harris? Harris, are you there?

1231
01:31:57.643 --> 01:31:58.644
Numan?

1232
01:32:01.730 --> 01:32:05.359
All units, head to the apron.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1233
01:32:05.442 --> 01:32:06.860
Numan, hurry up.

1234
01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.533
Jammers are offline.

1235
01:32:13.617 --> 01:32:17.454
The device is connected to the cell.
Going hot.

1236
01:32:21.333 --> 01:32:23.585
Good to go, boss. Let them know.

1237
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:24.795
I'll make the call.

1238
01:32:28.173 --> 01:32:29.174
You're late.

1239
01:32:29.258 --> 01:32:31.301
The package is secure and ready to depart.

1240
01:32:31.385 --> 01:32:32.427
And Mansur?

1241
01:32:32.511 --> 01:32:35.055
I have a video confession
ready to upload to the media.

1242
01:32:35.138 --> 01:32:37.850
-It's enough to buy some time.
-Outstanding.

1243
01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.192
-You have the route?
-Oh, yeah.

1244
01:32:47.276 --> 01:32:50.320
The extraction team will be ready for you
as soon as the package is in place.

1245
01:32:50.404 --> 01:32:51.405
Got it.

1246
01:32:54.992 --> 01:32:56.618
They're going for the ambulance!

1247
01:33:01.081 --> 01:33:02.040
Go.

1248
01:33:43.207 --> 01:33:45.334
Give it up, Lomax! It's done!

1249
01:33:45.417 --> 01:33:46.877
You're not leaving here!

1250
01:33:50.214 --> 01:33:51.590
Stop or I'll shoot--

1251
01:34:06.021 --> 01:34:07.856
You should have been working with us.

1252
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:04.413
We had everything set.

1253
01:35:07.332 --> 01:35:09.334
You had to fuck everything up, didn't you?

1254
01:35:11.670 --> 01:35:13.547
You don't even know
what you're dealing with.

1255
01:35:21.638 --> 01:35:23.807
You're a real pain in the ass.

1256
01:35:25.601 --> 01:35:27.561
And I should fucking kill you.

1257
01:35:44.912 --> 01:35:49.374
How many tours did it take for you to turn
into a fucking asshole for hire?

1258
01:35:49.458 --> 01:35:50.501
Five.

1259
01:36:09.895 --> 01:36:13.357
You can't stop this. It's too big.

1260
01:36:57.442 --> 01:36:58.527
Lomax!

1261
01:37:03.866 --> 01:37:05.367
Lomax, it's over.

1262
01:37:08.579 --> 01:37:11.665
If you trigger that device,
it's game over for all of us.

1263
01:37:13.542 --> 01:37:15.836
You really want to die for Farbridge?

1264
01:37:17.963 --> 01:37:19.006
Lomax!

1265
01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:28.140
Drop it. Drop the phone. Drop it.

1266
01:37:29.808 --> 01:37:31.435
Say it again.

1267
01:37:31.518 --> 01:37:33.645
They started the evacuation early.

1268
01:37:33.729 --> 01:37:35.022
POTUS is in the air.

1269
01:37:35.105 --> 01:37:37.691
The Joint Chiefs are en route
to the secure location.

1270
01:37:37.774 --> 01:37:41.236
We are go. I repeat, we are go. Out.

1271
01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.946
You called it in, didn't you?

1272
01:37:43.697 --> 01:37:45.657
Told them the bomb was
on the tarmac, yeah.

1273
01:37:46.658 --> 01:37:48.493
You double-verified it for me.

1274
01:37:50.412 --> 01:37:52.164
All your men are dead, Lomax.

1275
01:37:52.247 --> 01:37:54.791
There's no way that bomb
is getting away from this airport.

1276
01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:55.876
It's over.

1277
01:37:57.002 --> 01:38:00.339
And you still don't get it.
The bomb was only the beginning.

1278
01:38:00.422 --> 01:38:03.008
Right now, our people are moving in
on the Joint Chiefs.

1279
01:38:04.801 --> 01:38:06.970
We've got everyone
right where we want them.

1280
01:38:09.973 --> 01:38:11.558
Weapons down! Weapons down!

1281
01:38:11.642 --> 01:38:13.644
-Friendly! Friendly!
-Put your weapons down!

1282
01:38:13.727 --> 01:38:15.437
-Weapons down.
-Get down.

1283
01:38:15.521 --> 01:38:16.813
Put your fucking weapons down!

1284
01:38:16.897 --> 01:38:19.566
-Hands up now! You! Hands up!
-Keep them up!

1285
01:38:19.650 --> 01:38:21.443
-Hands where I can see them!
-Don't move.

1286
01:38:21.527 --> 01:38:23.570
-Friendly!
-Don't even move.

1287
01:38:23.654 --> 01:38:25.656
You. On your knees.

1288
01:38:25.739 --> 01:38:26.740
All right.

1289
01:38:28.075 --> 01:38:29.201
Cockpit clear!

1290
01:38:30.077 --> 01:38:31.620
I'm complying.

1291
01:38:31.703 --> 01:38:32.913
Get her out of here.

1292
01:38:34.289 --> 01:38:37.751
-Name?
-Jake Harris, Lieutenant Jake Harris.

1293
01:38:38.627 --> 01:38:40.212
He's with us. Pick him up.

1294
01:38:42.798 --> 01:38:46.927
Lieutenant, I have orders from
Admiral Mulholland to get you to safety.

1295
01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:48.512
He wants a full debrief.

1296
01:38:51.223 --> 01:38:52.516
Do you need a medic?

1297
01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:54.601
I'll live.

1298
01:38:55.894 --> 01:38:57.396
Just give me a minute, all right?

1299
01:38:59.231 --> 01:39:00.274
Fuck.

1300
01:39:05.195 --> 01:39:06.697
Transport's waiting outside.

1301
01:39:09.825 --> 01:39:10.826
Let's move.

1302
01:39:11.368 --> 01:39:13.912
-Give me an update on bomb disposal.
-Yes, sir. On it.

1303
01:39:15.706 --> 01:39:17.249
Cordon and maintain the airport.

1304
01:39:17.332 --> 01:39:19.459
-Coordinate with tactical safety teams.
-Yes, sir.

1305
01:39:19.585 --> 01:39:22.171
Hey. Call in local law enforcement
to assist.

1306
01:39:22.254 --> 01:39:23.922
Make sure
there aren't any other surprises.

1307
01:39:24.006 --> 01:39:25.007
Roger that.

1308
01:39:31.471 --> 01:39:33.307
My name is Amin Mansur--
