00:19:40.095 --> 00:19:44.098
l say he's an old fart
who thinks he still smells good.

183
00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:46.976
You have a way with words, Gaga.

184
00:19:55.777 --> 00:19:57.111
My friends...

185
00:19:57.279 --> 00:20:01.532
...welcome
to our first Prison Spetz Competition.

186
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.202
Please sit.

187
00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:14.045
Gentlemen...

188
00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:17.381
...we have before us a rare opportunity.

189
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:23.346
When our syndicate
invited members of the underworld here...

190
00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:29.602
...their interest was in the one thing
we all had in common...

191
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.187
...money.

192
00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:37.068
How do we ensure the highest profit
at the lowest risk?

193
00:20:38.695 --> 00:20:41.239
l know you all worked hard to get here.

194
00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:43.866
lt is not easy to do what we do.

195
00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:47.203
And even those with a lot of power...

196
00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:50.081
...had to pull many different strings...

197
00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:56.796
...to get our fighters released
and brought to this one spot here on earth.

198
00:20:57.464 --> 00:20:59.590
But, here we are.

199
00:21:00.008 --> 00:21:01.092
Enjoy.

200
00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:23.864
Some of you here
have been wondering about training.

201
00:21:24.032 --> 00:21:26.701
You'll each be given one hour a day
to train.

202
00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:32.707
But, before that, we'd like you to enjoy
some fresh air and general exercise.

203
00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:53.954
- Water.
- Thank you.

204
00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:56.207

207
00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:03.506
You're welcome.

208
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.514
Fuck me. Damn.

209
00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:13.057
l can't do this shit.

210
00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:15.142
Say, hey, yo.

211
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.019
What the fuck does this shit do?

212
00:23:17.187 --> 00:23:19.647
Shut your mouth. Keep working.

213
00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:22.733
No, see these motherfuckers out here,
that's they job to work.

214
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.610

215
00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:29.490
You got a problem with me, man?

216
00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:37.915
Hey, hey. Hey, l'm talking to you.
You got a fucking problem with me, man?

217
00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.626
Why don't you shut the fuck up already?

218
00:23:42.337 --> 00:23:45.005
Oh, l'm sorry,
l didn't hear what you said...

219
00:23:45.173 --> 00:23:47.842
...because, my hearing,
sometimes it comes and goes.

220
00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:49.218
What was that?

221
00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:53.556
Fucking Americans, all talk too much.

222
00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:57.810
Now l'm gonna come over this rock,
kick your ass, right here, right now.

223
00:23:57.978 --> 00:24:01.772
Hey. Stop right now.
You fight in the ring, nowhere else.

224
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.817
Fuck you. This ain't Roots, bitch.

225
00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:07.945
You fix your fucking mouth
when you talk to me.

226
00:24:11.074 --> 00:24:13.492
What the fuck is this bullshit?

227
00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:44.273
l hope you've enjoyed your first day.

228
00:24:44.441 --> 00:24:45.691
And, now, as promised...

229
00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:48.903
...if any of you would like to train
for tomorrow's first round...

230
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.529
...you have one hour.

231
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:03.918
l don't know about you right now, man.

232
00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:06.545
lt's showtime.

233
00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:28.275

Bling.

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:40.533
Have a better fucking conversation
anyway, you fake-ass caveman.

362
00:43:40.701 --> 00:43:42.327
Motherfucker.

363
00:43:42.494 --> 00:43:43.911
Fuck.

364
00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:46.998
Somebody let me out this motherfucker!

365
00:43:47.833 --> 00:43:48.916
Fuck.

366
00:44:05.434 --> 00:44:06.517
No, no, no.

367
00:44:06.685 --> 00:44:09.145
We're not gonna wait.
We're gonna see our clients now.

368
00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:11.230
Gaga, please.

369
00:44:14.193 --> 00:44:15.860
See what you could do.

370
00:44:17.738 --> 00:44:19.906
Brings back memories.

371
00:44:29.917 --> 00:44:32.168
lt was a good fight the other day.
How are you?

372
00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:34.045
How am l?

373
00:44:35.422 --> 00:44:36.506
Yes, how are you?

374
00:44:38.258 --> 00:44:39.592
Did you set me up?

375
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.387
What's going on?

376
00:44:42.971 --> 00:44:45.139
What sort of fucking tournament is this?

377
00:44:45.307 --> 00:44:47.517
Boyka, cut to the chase.
What's going on?

378
00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:49.894
We're being forced to do hard labor.

379
00:44:50.562 --> 00:44:53.481
Hard labor?
What the fuck are you talking about?

380
00:44:53.649 --> 00:44:56.067
l'm talking about l'm breaking rocks
with a hammer.

381
00:44:56.235 --> 00:44:57.652
Some fucking chain-gang shit.

382
00:44:58.654 --> 00:45:00.488
Son of a bitch.

383
00:45:00.656 --> 00:45:03.032
Yeah. You gonna do something about it?

384
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.034
Consider it done.

385
00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:08.538
Lying cocksuckers.

386
00:45:12.084 --> 00:45:16.587
l swear to Christ, l'm gonna fucking
clip somebody before this day is over.

387
00:45:26.306 --> 00:45:28.307
- Gentlemen.
- You cocksucker.

388
00:45:28.475 --> 00:45:31.310
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Of course you know Mr. Rezo.

389
00:45:34.314 --> 00:45:35.898
My friends.

390
00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:37.358
You seem agitated.

391
00:45:37.526 --> 00:45:40.278
Agitated?
Why is my fighter doing hard labor?

392
00:45:40.446 --> 00:45:42.905
Because you want him to lose,
of course.

393
00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:44.866
What did you expect?

394
00:45:45.033 --> 00:45:47.618
Did you really think...

395
00:45:49.121 --> 00:45:53.833
...that l would not arrange
for things to go my way?

396
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:57.420
You motherfucker, you know how much
cash l dropped to get my fighter here?

397
00:45:57.588 --> 00:45:58.755
Of course l do.

398
00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:00.298
l will fucking destroy you.

399
00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:02.383
Okay, perhaps.

400
00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:06.012
Or maybe
there is another way we can go.

401
00:46:06.388 --> 00:46:09.140
Remember what l said at the dinner?

402
00:46:09.641 --> 00:46:14.145
How do we ensure the greatest profit
at the lowest risk?

403
00:46:15.147 --> 00:46:17.607
So my suggestion is this:

404
00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:22.153
Go under your mattresses,
find all the money you can...

405
00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:27.450
...liquefy everything
and put it all on the Colombian.

406
00:46:28.202 --> 00:46:33.956
Do this and you will leave here
richer men than ever you could've dreamed.

407
00:46:34.917 --> 00:46:37.084
- What about our fighters?
- Fuck your fighters.

408
00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:39.378
Fuck our fighters?

409
00:46:39.546 --> 00:46:41.547
They're the weak horses.

410
00:46:41.715 --> 00:46:43.800
We put them down with the rest.

411
00:46:45.719 --> 00:46:49.388
Can you guarantee
that my fighter doesn't win?

412
00:46:49.765 --> 00:46:55.394
This l absolutely guarantee.

413
00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:13.871
Hey. Would you stop pulling?

414
00:47:14.039 --> 00:47:16.332
l'm not pulling.

415
00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:18.918
Yes, you are.

416
00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:23.506
You see me move, you move with me.

417
00:47:24.591 --> 00:47:27.134
l ain't Ginger Rogers,
and your ass ain't Fred Astaire.

418
00:47:27.302 --> 00:47:30.388
Give me a warning,
and l'll move with you.

419
00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:33.140
- Okay.
- Okay.

420
00:47:33.308 --> 00:47:35.017
l'm going to move now.

421
00:47:38.063 --> 00:47:39.564
That's funny, huh?

422
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:42.275
Wanna do this again?
End up in the motherfucking hole?

423
00:47:42.442 --> 00:47:43.985
ls that what you want?

424
00:47:44.152 --> 00:47:45.778
Sure, it is.

425
00:47:45.946 --> 00:47:46.988
So l'll tell you what.

426
00:47:47.155 --> 00:47:49.240
l want nothing more
but to get into your ass.

427
00:47:49.408 --> 00:47:52.118
But we're gonna do it in a ring
where it matters. Got it?

428
00:47:54.329 --> 00:47:55.788
- Fine.
- Fine.

429
00:47:55.956 --> 00:47:58.124
Uh-- On three.

430
00:47:58.292 --> 00:48:00.960
One, two, three.

431
00:48:07.384 --> 00:48:08.885
You know what?

432
00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:12.138
Where is that Colombian
motherfucker anyway?

433
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:52.762
Thanks.

434
00:48:55.223 --> 00:48:58.935
So, what did they clip you for?

435
00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:00.895
What? More bread.

436
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.940
What'd they pop you for?
What's your sentence?

437
00:49:05.484 --> 00:49:07.318
l speak English.

438
00:49:07.486 --> 00:49:09.028
Do you?

439
00:49:09.655 --> 00:49:14.951
l was just asking what are you actually
in this motherfucker for?

440
00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.495
Committed crime.

441
00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:20.623
You don't wanna talk?

442
00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:21.999
Fine, we ain't gotta talk.

443
00:49:22.167 --> 00:49:25.169
- Talking's bullshit anyway.
- lt's not my strength.

444
00:49:25.754 --> 00:49:27.463
No shit.

445
00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:40.726
You know what's going on, right?

446
00:49:40.894 --> 00:49:42.103
What?

447
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:44.522
This shit's fixed.

448
00:49:45.315 --> 00:49:46.399
What shit?

449
00:49:46.566 --> 00:49:49.235
This shit. This fucking tournament.

450
00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:52.947
And what's worse is we was fixed
in this fixed motherfucker.

451
00:49:53.115 --> 00:49:56.325
That why the fucking Colombian's
in a cell sipping on pina coladas...

452
00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:58.077
...while we're busting our asses.

453
00:49:58.245 --> 00:49:59.578
Of course.

454
00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:01.580
What do you mean of course?

455
00:50:01.748 --> 00:50:03.874
This is surprise to you?

456
00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:05.918
l came here to win.

457
00:50:06.086 --> 00:50:07.545
So did l .

458
00:50:09.756 --> 00:50:12.425
So this don't piss you off at all?

459
00:50:15.554 --> 00:50:18.139
Winning takes many things.

460
00:50:18.306 --> 00:50:20.558
Who can be the best fighter,
yes, of course.

461
00:50:20.726 --> 00:50:22.977
But most important.. .

462
00:50:26.148 --> 00:50:28.399
...who can survive.

463
00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:32.486
Survive what?

464
00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:40.327
ln here, the people you fight...

465
00:50:40.495 --> 00:50:42.955
...they are not just in the ring.

466
00:50:51.006 --> 00:50:52.882
Hey, come here.

467
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:54.425
The key.

468
00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:09.148
We can train?

469
00:51:14.029 --> 00:51:15.780
One hour.

470
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.284
Are you fucking crazy?

471
00:51:21.286 --> 00:51:22.995
Fuck that.

472
00:51:23.371 --> 00:51:26.499
l can barely fucking walk. Working out--

473
00:51:41.807 --> 00:51:43.432
ls that all you got?

474
00:51:50.357 --> 00:51:52.566
l'll give you a little test.

475
00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:01.951
Luka, listen to me.

476
00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:03.702
l need you to liquefy the fund.

477
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:04.912
Yes, all of it.

478
00:52:05.539 --> 00:52:08.165
No, no, no. By tomorrow.

479
00:52:08.333 --> 00:52:11.669
l-- l don't give a flying fuck how.

480
00:52:11.837 --> 00:52:13.671
Send a pigeon if you have to, okay?

481
00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:16.590
l know, Vito.
l know you vouched for me, Vito.

482
00:52:16.758 --> 00:52:20.219
But look, l need another million
like yesterday.

483
00:52:20.387 --> 00:52:22.304
Vito, this is a sure thing. lt's a lock.

484
00:52:26.226 --> 00:52:27.560
Yeah.

485
00:52:34.276 --> 00:52:35.734
Well, well, well.

486
00:52:35.902 --> 00:52:37.361
Look who's here.

487
00:52:39.781 --> 00:52:42.032
What the fuck is he doing here?

488
00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:48.539
Breakfast is over.

489
00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:55.963
This is some fucking bullshit.

490
00:52:56.131 --> 00:52:57.631
lt's a fucking joke.

491
00:52:57.799 --> 00:53:00.176
l'm supposed to fight like this.
They starving me out--

492
00:53:00.343 --> 00:53:01.760
- You curse too much.
- Fuck you.

493
00:53:01.928 --> 00:53:03.179
Then quit.

494
00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:05.723
Go back where you fucking came from.

495
00:53:07.058 --> 00:53:09.059
Maybe we can turn this around.

496
00:53:11.438 --> 00:53:14.899
- What the fuck does that mean?
- We can turn it to our advantage.

497
00:53:17.194 --> 00:53:18.319
lmprovise.

498
00:53:18.486 --> 00:53:19.570
Adapt.

499
00:53:19.738 --> 00:53:21.447
Overcome.

500
00:53:21.781 --> 00:53:24.241
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

501
00:53:24.618 --> 00:53:25.701
How?

502
00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:28.370
We can say this is work.

503
00:53:28.914 --> 00:53:31.248
Or we can say this is training.

504
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:38.505
One.

505
00:53:38.673 --> 00:53:40.007
Two.

506
00:53:40.342 --> 00:53:41.800
Three.

507
00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:49.266
Six, seven, eight...

508
00:53:49.434 --> 00:53:51.810
...nine, 1 0.

509
00:54:26.179 --> 00:54:27.805
What's wrong with your knee?

510
00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:29.098
l'm fine.

511
00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:31.892
- You don't act like you're fine.
- l said l'm fine.

512
00:54:48.493 --> 00:54:51.578
Squeeze that in your hand.
Take the oil and rub it on your knee.

513
00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:55.207
Do it.

514
00:54:56.418 --> 00:54:57.459
How do you know this?

515
00:54:57.627 --> 00:55:01.630
lmprovise, adapt, overcome.

516
00:55:01.881 --> 00:55:03.632
l know a whole lot of shit, Russia.

517
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.718
l know a whole lot of shit. Now let's go.

518
00:55:05.885 --> 00:55:10.431
Come on.

519
00:55:10.849 --> 00:55:13.475
Three, two....

520
00:55:27.282 --> 00:55:28.824
Children?

521
00:55:31.202 --> 00:55:33.162
You have children?

522
00:55:37.751 --> 00:55:39.168
Yeah.

523
00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:42.421
Boy and a girl.

524
00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:46.008
You?

525
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.762
No.

526
00:55:49.929 --> 00:55:51.680
Ever wanted any?

527
00:55:55.226 --> 00:55:56.268
Never?

528
00:55:56.603 --> 00:55:57.936
No.

529
00:55:58.313 --> 00:56:00.898
- Never wanted a son--
- You ask too many questions.

530
00:56:06.363 --> 00:56:08.614
This is why you want to win?

531
00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.574
Children?

532
00:56:12.452 --> 00:56:15.079
l've been locked up for a long time.

533
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.833
l mean, l ain't seen my youngest,
my sweet girl, for... .

534
00:56:20.001 --> 00:56:21.335
Since she was four weeks old.

535
00:56:21.503 --> 00:56:22.753
Water?

536
00:56:27.133 --> 00:56:28.634
What about you?

537
00:56:30.929 --> 00:56:32.388
l have to win.

538
00:56:34.641 --> 00:56:36.308
You have to win.

539
00:56:36.476 --> 00:56:38.519
You would not understand.

540
00:56:38.686 --> 00:56:39.728
Try me.

541
00:56:44.651 --> 00:56:47.611
God has given me a gift.

542
00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:49.071
Only one.

...in the world.

00:56:58.331 --> 00:57:00.958
My whole life, l've trained.

546
00:57:03.002 --> 00:57:04.711
For what?

547
00:57:06.714 --> 00:57:09.425
l must prove l am worthy of something.

548
00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:13.220
Damn.

549
00:57:15.014 --> 00:57:18.100
l'm gonna feel bad
when l'm whipping that ass.

550
00:57:27.193 --> 00:57:28.986
lt's about time.

551
00:57:36.411 --> 00:57:38.454
l'd like to place a new bet.

552
00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:40.122
Absolutely, Mr. Gaga.

Here.

556
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:11.320
Our first-round fight
in the semifinal is Boyka of Russia...

557
00:58:11.738 --> 00:58:14.615
...versus Andriago Silva of Brazil.

558
00:58:14.782 --> 00:58:16.283
Are you ready?

559
00:58:16.451 --> 00:58:18.118

Stop, stop, enough.

563
01:00:55.276 --> 01:00:56.985
Good fight.

564
01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.368
Winner.

01:01:04.535 --> 01:01:07.079
The first fight of the semifinal.

566
01:01:07.246 --> 01:01:11.041
The winner is Boyka from Russia.

567
01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:32.270
l'm worried, Kuss.

568
01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:37.401
That Russian Boyka looks very strong.

569
01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:39.111
Too strong.

570
01:01:39.278 --> 01:01:45.784
l can only imagine
that the American will look the same.

571
01:01:47.328 --> 01:01:50.497
Perhaps your methods...

572
01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.125
...are inadequate.

573
01:01:53.292 --> 01:01:54.835
l will step up my efforts.

574
01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:07.514
Look, you motherfuckers wanna tell me
what this shit's about?

575
01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:09.975
l want to talk to you about
your training partner.

576
01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:13.270
- My who?
- The Russian.

577
01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:16.982
Well, you gonna have to talk to the Russian
about the Russian.

578
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.234
l understand
you two have become sexual.

579
01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.906
What you say? Because sometimes
my hearing comes and goes.

580
01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:27.909
- They say you two are lovers.
- They say?

581
01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:31.329
You should know we don't allow
such perversions in this institution.

582
01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:34.916
l'm gonna fucking kill you.

583
01:02:49.807 --> 01:02:51.892
Take him to his cell.

584
01:03:26.385 --> 01:03:28.053
Hey, hey.

585
01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.098
Hey.

586
01:03:33.434 --> 01:03:35.018
Russia.

587
01:03:39.565 --> 01:03:40.899
Hey.

588
01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:45.111
The fucking warden.

589
01:03:46.864 --> 01:03:48.073
You need doctor.

590
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:49.908
Fuck that.

591
01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:54.120
Fucking give them the satisfaction?

592
01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:56.414
You take care of business.

593
01:03:56.874 --> 01:03:59.626
You and me,
we got a date in the ring, right?

594
01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:04.506
Right?

595
01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:27.279
You know, when l was in the hole.. .

596
01:04:27.446 --> 01:04:33.034
... l remember hearing great stories
about Yuri Boyka.

597
01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:36.621
King of prison fighters.

598
01:04:37.456 --> 01:04:39.165
l thought he must be... .

599
01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:45.046
But then he lose.

600
01:04:45.464 --> 01:04:48.341
He lose to an American boxer.

601
01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:52.095
They say Boyka's a wounded horse now.

602
01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:56.266
He's a champion of the toilets.

603
01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:02.981
lf l'm champion of the toilets...

604
01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:07.193
...what does that make you
when l kick the fucking shit out of you?

605
01:05:07.653 --> 01:05:09.821
lt's okay, muneco.

606
01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:22.000
Make sure you spend some quality time
with your American boyfriend.

607
01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:24.794
lt will be his last.

608
01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:39.721
Get them to work.

609
01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:47.353
How well do you know the forest?

610
01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:50.023
- What?
- Look, it's no time to bullshit me.

611
01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:52.484
You were military, yes?

612
01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:56.654
Listen to me.

613
01:07:57.031 --> 01:08:01.326
You will not survive the fight tomorrow,
they will make sure of it.

614
01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:06.372
l don't give a fuck.

615
01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:10.001
You must give a fuck.

616
01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:22.889
Shit.

617
01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:25.308
These motherfuckers will not break me.

618
01:08:25.476 --> 01:08:26.726

619
01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:28.895
This is not the time.
You must leave here.

620
01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:31.523
Where the fuck
am l supposed to go, huh?

621
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:40.323
This will give you a chance.

622
01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:42.784
A chance for what?

623
01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:45.870
Security out here
is not as heavy as it should be.

624
01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:48.206
No one expects one of us to escape.

625
01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:50.166
We're here to fight.

626
01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:52.210

You know how to survive.

- So, what, you my guardian angel now?
- l'm no angel.

629
01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.804
No. l'm gonna fight this fucking guy.

630
01:09:02.972 --> 01:09:06.349
- Not in your condition, it is not a true test.
- l'm gonna fight.

631
01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:08.560
There is no honor in it.

632
01:09:08.727 --> 01:09:10.728
There's no honor in running.

633
01:09:11.063 --> 01:09:13.731
There's no honor in dying for money.

634
01:09:14.608 --> 01:09:18.361
Well, l ain't gonna die, okay? Fuck that.

635
01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:21.739
l fucking lose, l just fucking go home.
Back to square one.

636
01:09:21.907 --> 01:09:27.328
- Do like what l've been doing, fuck.
- No one goes home, not from here.

637
01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.998
The losing fighters all disappear.

638
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.419
No one gets out alive.

639
01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.465
See?

640
01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:42.802
You don't have a choice.

641
01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:46.097
Fuck.

642
01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:52.770
Okay, all right,

01:09:53.063 --> 01:09:54.731

644
01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:56.399
Hey.

645
01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:58.818
They're gonna fucking kill you for this.

646
01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:02.030
No, they need me to fight.

647
01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:05.116
They will not destroy their final payday.

648
01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:09.662
Russia, why are you doing this?

649
01:10:11.081 --> 01:10:14.792
Stop asking so many fucking questions.

650
01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:18.796
Hit it.

651
01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.841
Come on, hit it. Harder.

652
01:10:22.676 --> 01:10:24.052
Hit it.

653
01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.595
Hit it again.

654
01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:28.264
Damn it, hit it. Hit it.

655
01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:29.891
Hit it, damn it, hit it.

656
01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:00.630
You motherfucker.

657
01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:02.173
l told you, motherfucker.

658
01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:05.927
l told you, motherfucker. l told you.

659
01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.471
Never fuck with me.

660
01:11:56.937 --> 01:11:58.438
Go.

661
01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:05.153
Go!

662
01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:42.982
You know, of all the fighters
l expected would give us trouble...

663
01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:45.151
...you were the last on the list.

664
01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:49.655
- Where is the American?
- He'll be found and dealt with.

665
01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.203
l want to speak to Gaga.

666
01:12:57.706 --> 01:13:00.458
He has requests now.

667
01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:04.420
Do you think Gaga
or anyone else can help you?

668
01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:10.468
- You think Gaga gives a shit about you?
- He gives a shit about his money.

669
01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:11.761
And that's what l am.

670
01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:15.431
l would not be so sure about that.

671
01:13:16.683 --> 01:13:17.767
What does that mean?

672
01:13:18.185 --> 01:13:21.396
lt means there's been a change of plans.

673
01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:29.487
l made a new wager, Boyka.

674
01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:32.740
Sorry, my friend.

675
01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:36.661
You just can't beat the Colombian,
not with your knee.

676
01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:38.413
You are with these animals?

677
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.665
l'm with the money.

678
01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.041
l'm always with the money.

679
01:13:42.626 --> 01:13:45.837
We have been forced to improvise.

680
01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:49.799
You will now fight the Colombian
in the final.

681
01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:54.345
What will ye give me?

682
01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:56.973
And l will deliver him unto you.

683
01:13:58.517 --> 01:13:59.517
Excuse me.

684
01:14:01.061 --> 01:14:02.770
You fucking Judas!

685
01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:07.191
Okay. Okay, l'm a fucking Judas.

686
01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:11.028
Now, that makes you what?

687
01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:14.490
- Jesus?
- No.

688
01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:17.076
That makes me angry.

689
01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:30.423

01:22:14.846 --> 01:22:17.306
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka.

726
01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:34.156
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka.

727
01:23:02.727 --> 01:23:07.606
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka.

728
01:24:28.146 --> 01:24:31.190
Fuck, it's over.

729
01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:35.152
Stop, stop, stop, stay right there.

730
01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:01.929
The winner from Russia is Boyka.

731
01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:09.603
"l guarantee you," huh?
"l absolutely guarantee it."

732
01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:12.439
You ancient fuck.

733
01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:15.692
You just cost me $5 million, Rezo.

734
01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.070
l'm gonna eat your brain with a spoon.

735
01:25:18.238 --> 01:25:22.741
You understand me? l'm gonna eat
your fucking brain with a spoon.

736
01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:33.168
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka.

737
01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:45.597
You fucked up.

738
01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.766
l don't know how this happened.

739
01:25:47.934 --> 01:25:49.226
l don't give a rat's ass how.

740
01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:52.187
All l know, l'm out a shitload of money
that l don't have.

741
01:25:52.355 --> 01:25:54.314
And you're gonna have
to come up with it.

742
01:25:58.611 --> 01:25:59.778
Die.

743
01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:27.973
You did well, Mr. Boyka.

744
01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:30.767
l don't want your fucking prize.

745
01:26:30.935 --> 01:26:32.352
Just show me the front door.

746
01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.855
Yes, well, about that....

747
01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:36.148
About what?

748
01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:39.193
l'm afraid we have a problem.

749
01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.486
You see, the agreement
of this tournament...

750
01:26:41.654 --> 01:26:43.947
...was that one man
would receive his freedom.

751
01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:49.328
You're talking about agreements now?

752
01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:52.706
Unfortunately,
we have not recovered the American.

753
01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:55.709
And since you're responsible
for his escape...

754
01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:59.421
... l'm afraid you have forfeited your chance
to leave here a free man.

755
01:26:59.923 --> 01:27:03.759
Anyway,
you're not walking free out of this facility.

756
01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:07.262
lndeed, you're going right back
to the toilet you came from.

757
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:13.477
l did what l had to do.

758
01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.649
Where l go now...

759
01:27:19.859 --> 01:27:21.151
... l don't care.

760
01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:26.156
Good, then you'll not annoy me
with any resistance.

761
01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:28.659
A bus is waiting outside.

762
01:27:49.347 --> 01:27:53.308
l will give you this, you're quite a fighter.

763
01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:55.852
Quite a fighter.

764
01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:58.647
Too bad you're such damaged goods.

765
01:27:58.815 --> 01:28:01.566
l have already arranged
to have you picked up.

766
01:28:01.734 --> 01:28:02.985
Pity about your freedom.

767
01:28:03.903 --> 01:28:05.529
This is my freedom.

768
01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:30.262
You fucked with the wrong nigga.

769
01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:36.310
Let's go.

770
01:28:37.437 --> 01:28:38.895
Why did you do this?

771
01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:42.899
Stop asking so many fucking questions.

772
01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:45.319
Where are we going?

773
01:28:47.238 --> 01:28:49.323
God, it's good.

774
01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.459
Open it.

775
01:29:00.626 --> 01:29:02.419
Go ahead, open it.

776
01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:07.883
lt's your share.

777
01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:10.594
l put all my money on you.

778
01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:13.472
Oh, you know me, l'm all about money.

779
01:29:13.639 --> 01:29:19.019
And you,
well, good knee, bad knee, no knee...

780
01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:22.689
...you're still the best fighter in the world,
especially when you're angry.

781
01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:27.611
Heh, heh. Fuck cholesterol,
winning makes me hungry.

782
01:29:28.905 --> 01:29:31.823
You're a free man now. How does it feel?

783
01:29:35.745 --> 01:29:39.164
- You're going with him?
- Yeah.

784
01:29:39.582 --> 01:29:42.501
- And your children?
- Heh. Yeah.

785
01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.130
l must go. Stop the car.

786
01:29:48.591 --> 01:29:50.133
Okay.

787
01:29:58.142 --> 01:30:00.644
Yo, yo, yo, Russia, Russia, Russia.

788
01:30:04.148 --> 01:30:06.316
Look, you ain't got to thank me.

789
01:30:06.943 --> 01:30:08.735
Hell, l owed you.

790
01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:11.363
- You didn't owe me.
- Yeah, l did.

791
01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:15.575
Where l'm from, there ain't shit for free.

792
01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:19.996
And where l'm from,
everything was for free.

793
01:30:20.164 --> 01:30:22.416
And it was all shit.

794
01:30:24.168 --> 01:30:25.877
Any idea where you're gonna go, man?

795
01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:31.425
Mr. Turbo, l'm waiting.

796
01:30:32.885 --> 01:30:34.970
Look, l better get out of here.

797
01:30:36.055 --> 01:30:37.806
See you around, buddy.

798
01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:40.058
lt's Yuri.

799
01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.272
My first name, it's Yuri.

800
01:30:51.404 --> 01:30:53.029
Jericho.

801
01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:56.074
- Jericho?
- Yeah.

802
01:30:56.701 --> 01:30:57.784
l know, it's shit, huh?

803
01:30:58.327 --> 01:30:59.661
Heh.

804
01:31:01.205 --> 01:31:03.707
You bring down the walls.

805
01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:10.088
lt's a good name.

806
01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:14.050
Yeah.

807
01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:17.679
l guess today it is.

808
01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:22.934
My man.

809
01:31:26.272 --> 01:31:31.193
Oh, almost forgot, you and me,
we got some unfinished business.

810
01:31:33.946 --> 01:31:36.072
- Our fight?
- You bet your ass.

811
01:31:37.783 --> 01:31:40.202
- Next time.
- Yeah, next time, next time, let's go.

812
01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:47.250
Next time, brother, you and me.

813
01:32:25.498 --> 01:32:26.915
Yeah!

ζωή!

602
01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.900
Αυτοσχεδίασε.
Ένα εμπόδιο ξεπερνιέται.

603
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.800
Επτά!

604
01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.800
Οκτώ!

605
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.700
Έλα, αγόρι μου.

606
01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:54.800
Μπόικα!

607
01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.500
Μπόικα!

608
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.600
Μπόικα!

609
01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:27.300
Μπράβο!

610
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.400
Μπόικα!

611
01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.800
Μπόικα!

612
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.500
Μπόικα! Μπόικα!

613
01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:15.100
Μπόικα! Μπόικα!
Μπόικα!

614
01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:19.200
Μπόικα! Μπόικα!
Μπόικα!

615
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:30.300
Γαμώτο!
Τελείωσε!

616
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.800
Σταμάτα! Σταμάτα!
Μείνε εκεί!

617
01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.500
Ο νικητής απ' τη Ρωσία
είναι ο Μπόικα!

618
01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.300
"Σας το εγγυώμαι", έτσι;
" Σας το εγγυώμαι απόλυτα".

619
01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:14.600
Αρχαίε γαμιόλη, μόλις μου κόστισες
5 εκατομμύρια δολάρια.

620
01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.300
Θα φάω τα μυαλά σου
με το κουταλάκι.

621
01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.100
Καταλαβαίνεις; Θα φάω τα μυαλά σου
με το κουταλάκι.

622
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.200
Μπόικα! Μπόικα!
Μπόικα!

623
01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.000
- Τα γάμησες!
- Δεν ξέρω πώς έγινε αυτό.

624
01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.599
Δε με νοιάζει το πώς έγινε.

625
01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:51.500
Το μόνο που ξέρω είναι ότι δανείστηκα
ένα σωρό λεφτά, που δεν έχω.

626
01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.500
Κι εσύ θα πρέπει να το φροντίσεις
αυτό.

627
01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.500
Πέθανε!

628
01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.499
Τα πήγες καλά, κύριε Μπόικα.

629
01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:29.800
Δε θέλω το γαμημένο το βραβείο σου.

630
01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.100
Απλά δείξε μου την μπροστινή
πόρτα.

631
01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.300
Ναι, λοιπόν, σχετικά μ' αυτό...

632
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:37.800
- Τι μ' αυτό;
- Φοβάμαι ότι έχουμε πρόβλημα.

633
01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:43.800
Βλέπεις, η συμφωνία γι' αυτό το τουρνουά
ήταν ότι ένας άντρας θα ελευθερωνόταν.

634
01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.100
Μιλάς για συμφωνίες τώρα;

635
01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.200
Ακόμα δεν έχουν βρει τον Αμερικανό.

636
01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:55.200
Κι εφόσον εσύ είσαι υπεύθυνος
που δραπέτευσε,

637
01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:59.200
νομίζω ότι χάνεις το δικαίωμα να φύγεις
ως ελεύθερος άνθρωπος.

638
01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:03.300
Όπως και να ' χει, δε θα φύγεις
ελεύθερος απ' αυτή τη φυλακή.

639
01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:07.100
Θα επιστρέψεις στην τουαλέτα
από την οποία ήρθες.

640
01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:12.600
Έκανα αυτό που έπρεπε να κάνω.

641
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.800
Το πού θα πάω τώρα,
δε με νοιάζει.

642
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.100
Ωραία. Οπότε δεν θα αντισταθείς.

643
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.200
Το λεωφορείο μας περιμένει
απέξω.

644
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.000
Το ομολογώ, είσαι πολύ καλός
πυγμάχος.

645
01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:57.300
Πολύ καλός πυγμάχος. Κρίμα που
είσαι τόσο τραυματισμένος.

646
01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.500
Γι'αυτό το λόγο θα βάλω τέλος
στο μαρτύριό σου.

647
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.400
- Κέρδισες την ελευθερία σου.
- Αυτή είναι η ελευθερία μου;

648
01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.700
Τα βάλατε με τον λάθος άντρα!

649
01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:35.600
Πάμε!

650
01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:38.200
Γιατί το έκανες αυτό;

651
01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:41.100
Σταμάτα να κάνεις τόσες γαμημένες
ερωτήσεις!

652
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:48.000
- Πού πάμε;
- Θεέ μου, είναι ωραίο!

653
01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.400
- Άνοιξέ το.
- Άντε, άνοιξέ το.

654
01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:09.500
Είναι το μερίδιό σου.
Στοιχημάτισα όλα μου τα λεφτά σ' εσένα.

655
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.900
Με ξέρεις.
Μ' ενδιαφέρουν μόνο τα λεφτά.

656
01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.500
Ήξερα ότι...

657
01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:18.100
καλό γόνατο, κακό γόνατο,
καθόλου γόνατο,

658
01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.599
είσαι ακόμα ο καλύτερος
παλαιστής στον κόσμο.

659
01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.900
Ιδιαίτερα όταν είσαι θυμωμένος.

660
01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:26.900
Γάμα τη χοληστερίνη.
Η νίκη με κάνει να πεινάω.

661
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.800
Είσαι ένας ελεύθερος άνθρωπος τώρα.
Πώς νιώθεις;

662
01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:38.500
- Θα πας μαζί του;
- Ναι.

663
01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:42.700
- Είναι δική σου απόφαση;
- Ναι.

664
01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.300
Πρέπει να φύγω.
Σταμάτησε το αμάξι.

665
01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:49.600
Εντάξει.

666
01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.400
Περίμενε.

667
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.300
Κοίτα, δε χρειάζεται να μ' ευχαριστήσεις.

668
01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.500
Και στο χρωστούσα.

669
01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.500
- Δεν μου το είπες.
- Ναι, στο είπα.

670
01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:14.800
Από εκεί που κατάγομαι;
Τίποτα δεν είναι τζάμπα.

671
01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:19.500
Από εκεί που εγώ έρχομαι όλα είναι
τζάμπα.

672
01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.800
Όχι τέτοιες μαλακίες.

673
01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:26.100
Έχεις καμιά ιδέα για το πού θα πας,
φίλε;

674
01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:31.300
Κύριε Τούρμπο, περιμένω.

675
01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.200
Καλύτερα να φύγω.

676
01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.100
Θα τα πούμε, φίλε.

677
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.300
Γιούρι.
