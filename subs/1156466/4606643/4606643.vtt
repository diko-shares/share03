{1268}{1359}I came here for the first time 50 years ago,
{1373}{1392}on my honeymoon.
{1487}{1558}It was certainly not my|intention to be unfaithful,
{1591}{1697}but here on these cliffs I fell|under the spell of a mistress.
{1728}{1845}One that has not released|her grip in all these years.
{2208}{2273}I was just a young geologist,
{2285}{2422}fascinated by the layered rocks|thrust up from the deep oceans,
{2427}{2466}millions of years ago.
{3209}{3258}Here is where I found
{3267}{3329}the very strange fossilised burrows
{3331}{3444}of an animal that lived hundreds of|millions of years before the dinosaurs.
{3514}{3580}Only now, after 50 years,
{3588}{3649}do we have a chance to solve this great mystery,
{3649}{3752}and maybe catch the oldest|living fossil on earth,
{3759}{3813}Paleodictyon Nodosum.
{4224}{4271}The research vessel Atlantis,
{4287}{4350}destination is the mid-Atlantic ridge system
{4357}{4450}500 miles ahead and 12,000 ft. down.
{4466}{4527}On board are some 58 sailors,
{4538}{4596}engineers, and scientists,
{4603}{4659}including geologist Peter Rona,
{4670}{4725}and palaeontologist Dolf Seilacher.
{4787}{4937}It was Peter Rona who found mysterious|patterns of holes on the deep sea floor.
{4969}{5021}After many letters back and forth,
{5025}{5047}here we were,
{5063}{5196}two old fossils with the chance to|solve a wonderful puzzle of science.
{5570}{5619}The deep ocean submersible Alvin.
{5641}{5748}She has spent more hours in the deep sea|than all of the world's submersibles combined.
{5766}{5798}For the upcoming dives,
{5800}{5862}she is being outfitted with|high resolution cameras
{5867}{5924}and 4000 Watts of illumination.
{5979}{6053}Great care is taken in the|preparation of each dive.
{6062}{6144}For Alvin and her crew are bound|for the harshest place on earth.
{6547}{6651}The search for the oldest living fossil|actually began 30 years earlier
{6653}{6720}on a series of dives in another ocean entirely
{6728}{6755}the eastern Pacific.
{7117}{7225}Scientists were investigating a curious|temperature differential in the water column.
{7253}{7273}What they found
{7273}{7384}was clearly some kind of a volcanic process|that was building elaborate structures.
{8818}{8885}Water descending into fissures in the sea floor
{8889}{8959}was apparently interacting|with the hot rocks beneath
{8964}{9048}to re-emerge as a black|cocktail of poison chemicals.
{9449}{9567}While it was difficult for scientists to understand|the geological processes at work,
{9582}{9678}the animals living on the chimneys were|virtually impossible to comprehend.
{10227}{10319}The sub's temperature probes indicated|water hot enough to melt lead
{10328}{10397}and it was heavily laden|with hydrogen sulphide.
{10482}{10529}There should have been|nothing alive here at all.
{10883}{10968}Among these amazing creatures|was the worm, alvinella.
{10985}{11065}Like tiny court jesters mocking science itself,
{11070}{11130}they danced in and out of the poison water,
{11130}{11188}hot enough to boil a lobster bright red.
{11422}{11454}As sunlight creatures,
{11458}{11514}we didn't think to look in the dark for life,
{11537}{11620}nor did we think to look in water|hot enough to boil us alive.
{11789}{11877}The discovery of hydrothermal vents|in the Pacific near Galapagos
{11886}{11947}was the first step in a 30 year quest
{11949}{12037}to connect Silicer's ancient|fossils on the cliffs of Spain
{12049}{12133}with the mysterious lifeforms|on the mid-Atlantic sea floor.
{12258}{12389}Human exploration of the deep sea is a|slow, complex and dangerous process.
{12406}{12485}Finding the target miles below|the ship will be difficult enough.
{12524}{12603}Recovering a living specimen would|be a triumph for the team.
{12913}{12985}On board this dive is|marine geologist Peter Rona.
{13011}{13055}Chief pilot is Bruce Strickrott,
{13072}{13133}observer is palaeontologist Dolf Seilacher.
{13748}{13870}It will take over two hours for Alvin to make|the 2 1/2 mile journey to the sea floor.
{13888}{13929}Within the first thousand feet,
{13934}{13991}all traces of sunlight will disappear.
{14709}{14735}As the sub descends,
{14735}{14850}there is always a chance scientists may glimpse|a creature never before seen by human eyes,
{14858}{14901}and perhaps never to be seen again.
{14980}{15035}The soft-bodied creatures of the sea
{15040}{15096}will hardly ever leave a trace behind
{15107}{15220}no fossil that a palaeontologist could|study millions of years later.
{15256}{15431}Yet these creatures were probably around|hundreds of millions or even a billion years ago
{15445}{15497}there is just no way for us to know.
{15527}{15579}They are like phantoms of the sea.
{16797}{16840}Travelling to the sea floor and back
{16840}{16924}will use up five hours of Alvin's|air supply and battery power,
{16944}{17063}leaving scientists with only four hours to find|their target and recover their specimens.
{17090}{17134}Depending on ocean currents, however,
{17138}{17214}Alvin may have drifted well off|course on the long trip down.
{17592}{17683}I was expecting only mud in every direction.
{17722}{17819}We had landed on the most fantastic|landscape I had ever seen.
{17980}{18033}This was a very recent eruption.
{18076}{18220}I could easily imagine the red-hot|lava boiling up from deep below,
{18246}{18374}creating almost animal-like shapes|the size of a Volkswagen beetle.
{18405}{18487}It felt like a journey to|the centre of the earth.
{18916}{19009}Here in the deep Atlantic where the|American and European plates rub together,
{19022}{19117}Alvin can actually fly from the|American plate to the European
{19117}{19166}in not much longer than the blink of an eye.
{20664}{20726}It is called, simply, the mid-ocean Ridge.
{20741}{20842}10,000 ft. high, 500 mile wide,
{20852}{20914}and some 40,000 miles long.
{20940}{21021}It is the largest geological feature|on the face of the earth.
{21174}{21274}The outer shell of the earth|floats on a hot underlying layer.
{21295}{21346}Where the plates move apart,
{21346}{21436}magma rises, to form the mid-Ocean Ridge.
{21644}{21715}This volcanic system is|the oven of planet Earth.
{21730}{21796}It bakes the earth's crust on a daily basis,
{21806}{21842}it boils sea water,
{21846}{21932}serving-up nutrients to creatures|of the abyss and occasionally,
{21939}{21981}it roasts them alive.
{22156}{22236}In the eastern Pacific,|off the coast of Mexico,
{22247}{22330}the animals were helpless|in the face of molten lava
{22333}{22402}suddenly emerging from|the surrounding crevasses.
{23225}{23283}Between one Alvin dive and the next,
{23293}{23365}an extraordinary world simply disappeared.
{23397}{23458}Replacing it, were sculptures of cooled rock,
{23464}{23570}left behind after most of the lava had|flowed back down into the volcano.
{24266}{24333}It was like the ruins of|an ancient civilisation.
{24403}{24486}A grim memorial to an|oasis of life burned away,
{24512}{24553}perhaps never to return.
{24749}{24813}But when Alvin descended after the eruption,
{24832}{24893}scientist were puzzled by what they saw.
{25043}{25117}As they approached the volcano at 9Â° north,
{25130}{25200}mysterious spaghetti worms covered the rocks
{25215}{25273}and there were large anemones growing nearby.
{25393}{25429}Galatheid crabs, 
{25554}{25600}numerous species of octopus,
{25670}{25720}including something that they named "Dumbo",
{25739}{25839}whose purpose at the edge of this|poison oasis defied comprehension.
{26150}{26186}There was zoarcid fish,
{26193}{26228}giant tubeworms
{26237}{26286}and golden mussels everywhere.
{26434}{26509}There were billions of tiny|white feather dusters,
{26514}{26608}filtering nutrients from the hot|water emerging from the rocks.
{26692}{26775}Life had not just returned to|the volcano at nine north
{26788}{26830}in a few short of years,
{26832}{26923}it was back with a scale and|vigour almost beyond belief.
{27191}{27281}This was truly an extraordinary|place, like no other on earth.  
{27402}{27451}It had seen a billion years of darkness,
{27458}{27488}yet there was no night.
{27508}{27637}It was a place without seasons,|without rest, without time.
{27657}{27722}A world driven by the rhythms|of the inner earth.
{28119}{28183}At the centre of this strange|resurrection of life
{28183}{28270}was a magnificent 40 ft.|high volcanic monolith,
{28279}{28349}decorated with six-foot long tubeworms.
{28598}{28715}The tubeworms clearly prospered amongst the|hottest water as the pillar grew upwards. 
{28797}{28866}The most important clue lay|at the bottom of the pillar.
{28886}{28952}Here, there were tubes, but no worms.
{28965}{29044}Unable to move, and left behind in the cold,
{29051}{29125}these unfortunate creatures had|apparently starved to death.
{29408}{29467}With no mouth and no stomach,
{29467}{29513}and planted permanently in the rock,
{29520}{29605}the tubeworms at first seemed|more like plants than animals.
{29727}{29823}Scientists, however, found specialised|bacteria in the tubeworms' tissues
{29823}{29916}that were using chemical energy|and hot water to make nutrients.
{29997}{30084}The bacteria were, in effect,|turning poison into food
{30089}{30143}and sharing it with their host, the tubeworm.
{30415}{30460}The red filaments on the top of the worm
{30462}{30569}draw hydrogen sulphide from the|water to feed the bacteria inside.
{30647}{30702}This miracle is called chemosynthesis.
{30784}{30891}Scientist were astonished to discover|the tubeworms' red colour
{30891}{30958}comes from blood containing haemoglobin
{30962}{30993}very much like our own.
{31029}{31099}So who are these fantastic|creatures of the dark,
{31106}{31183}who share with us the very blood|that flows through our veins?
{31268}{31356}5 billion years ago, a giant star,
{31370}{31438}a 100 times greater than our own sun, 
{31450}{31496}blew itself into a supernova.
{31607}{31674}Throughout the remaining|cloud of gas and debris,
{31681}{31768}there accumulated enough|matter to reignite new stars,
{31770}{31809}including our own Sun.
{32421}{32479}It is believed that the planets then formed,
{32494}{32534}orbiting round the Sun,
{32544}{32635}growing larger and larger as they|acquired debris from space.
{32702}{32766}As the earth cooled and built a solid crust,
{32767}{32809}the oceans were able to form.
{33055}{33088}Life then flourished, 
{33093}{33145}blanketing the earth with green plants
{33149}{33198}by harnessing energy from the Sun,
{33200}{33239}using photosynthesis.
{33580}{33714}We once believed the Sun's radiation to be the|only source of energy for all life on earth.
{33746}{33835}But deep beneath the earth's crust,|there remains an ancient furnace,
{33854}{33955}fuelled by decaying radiation|from that long-ago giant star.
{34105}{34218}It is this energy that gives life to the|extraordinary animals of the deep sea.
{34244}{34329}An eruption of life, driven by|the embers of a dead star,
{34346}{34403}still burning, deep within the earth.
{34910}{35013}Over the years, as Alvin threw her|beams of light across the abyss,
{35028}{35124}the spirit of this volcanic forces has|begun to seem almost limitless.
{35154}{35226}Just as scientists managed|to unravel one mystery,
{35241}{35292}another would loom out of the darkness.
{35423}{35464}They call it "lost city".
{35499}{35615}Vast cathedrals are formed as water|descends into the mantle of the earth,
{35629}{35686}then heats-up chemically and reappears,
{35699}{35756}building enormous sculptures of limestone.
{35936}{35978}The bacteria living here,
{35993}{36035}and the ecosystem around them
{36050}{36113}are based on an ancient methane chemistry,
{36122}{36183}unlike any of the vents previously discovered.
{36255}{36317}Without these new discoveries in the deep sea,
{36327}{36442}mysteries like those found on the cliffs in|Spain would remain forever locked in stone.
{36808}{36863}The fossils Dolf Seilacher found here
{36863}{36978}are among the first evidence that life on|earth would learn to build complex structures,
{36990}{37007}but how? 
{37018}{37035}And why?
{37111}{37181}Paleodictyon is a living fossil.
{37196}{37252}The oldest were simple meanders,
{37256}{37311}made by animals struggling in the mud.
{37401}{37460}But over hundreds of millions of years,
{37468}{37531}the tunnels became more and more elaborate
{37531}{37662}until these creatures learned to|build a perfect hexagonal pattern.
{37875}{37979}This creature and its tunnels survived|mass extinctions that killed
{37979}{38040}almost all other life on earth.
{38076}{38132}So what was it is wonderful secret?
{38876}{38919}Once scientists knew where to look,
{38927}{39018}they began to find an almost limitless|variety of hydrothermal structures
{39020}{39066}growing along the mid-Atlantic ridge.
{39090}{39202}They make possible a fantastic wilderness|of life as rich as anywhere on earth.
{39369}{39442}It was very difficult to imagine|that these structures
{39446}{39528}were not created for the animals inside.
{39560}{39707}The bowls are so perfect to serve up the|soup of bacteria for the shrimp to eat.
{39904}{39994}Everywhere we went, the|geology was as-if alive.
{40031}{40129}Massive structures growing|not in millions of years,
{40141}{40198}but almost before our eyes.
{40373}{40483}For years, almost every dive would|produce more questions than answers,
{40497}{40569}around almost every corner, another puzzle.
{40591}{40654}But after decades of exploration and study,
{40659}{40708}some mysteries began to unfold.
{40814}{40883}At the centre of the relationship|between the animals
{40883}{40935}and the flow of energy from the chimneys,
{40946}{41025}are hundreds of species|of specialised bacteria
{41042}{41073}growing on the rocks.
{41391}{41467}The bacteria use chemical|energy from the hot water
{41467}{41549}to produce nutrients necessary|to sustain their metabolism.
{41763}{41845}The shrimp grazing on the rocks|use the bacteria as food.
{41999}{42121}For the shrimp there is a fine line between|a good, solid meal and getting burned alive.
{42176}{42228}The white shrimp at the top of this mound
{42232}{42333}has burned off most of its extremities|whilst grazing among the hot rocks.
{42843}{42909}What began as a curiosity in that Pacific
{42912}{42977}has become a vast worldwide phenomenon.
{43041}{43139}Dozens of new sites have been explored|throughout the mid Ocean Ridge system.
{43192}{43292}Scientists were not expecting much of|interest on the mid-Atlantic ridge.
{43329}{43418}What they found was the most|fantastic vent of them all.
{43623}{43682}The size and shape of a football stadium,
{43691}{43748}they dubbed it the Houston Astrodome.
{46441}{46497}Chemosynthetic bacteria, it turns out,
{46503}{46583}were not just growing on the rocks,|but on the shrimps, themselves.
{46653}{46732}The shrimp are coated in a|slimy layer of bacteria,
{46732}{46773}which they scrape off and eat.
{46843}{46909}The shrimp seem to fight for|position in the hot water,
{46942}{46992}in order to feed their coat of bacteria.
{47015}{47114}When scientist began to look beyond the|obvious feeding patterns of the animals,
{47156}{47232}and probe deeper into the|chimney walls themselves,
{47315}{47383}they made perhaps the most|astonishing discovery.
{47472}{47504}In total darkness,
{47524}{47591}bathed in the poison breath of the inner earth,
{47608}{47699}at 3500 lb. of pressure per square inch
{47706}{47790}and temperatures exceeding 230Â° Fahrenheit,
{47813}{47887}lives the microscopic hyperthermaphile.
{47935}{47999}We did not even think to look here for life.
{48132}{48197}There is no harsher environment on earth.
{48238}{48299}There is no creature more alien to us.
{48640}{48739}Yet as we journey down deeper|among the molecules of its DNA,
{48758}{48858}we reach the four base chemicals|of life's universal alphabet.
{48885}{48955}This is the language of human DNA.
{48974}{49055}And in this, we are most certainly related.
{49202}{49296}There is a good chance that this|is where life began on earth.
{49317}{49394}And here among the embers|of that long ago dead star,
{49405}{49501}is where we began our|journey, 5 billion years ago.
{49891}{49950}With the discovery of|microbes living in the vents,
{49961}{50010}perhaps miles below the sea floor,
{50029}{50149}scientist began to consider that most of|the biomass on earth might well live here,
{50165}{50218}beneath the volcanoes of the deep sea.
{51588}{51667}No one knows how or why a vent shuts off,
{51693}{51774}but here, where billions of|creatures once thrived,
{51790}{51861}all that remains are great mounds of minerals.
{51913}{51972}Iron, zinc, silver and gold
{51980}{52033}once spewed from the furnaces beneath.
{52132}{52210}There is little in this metallic|desert to sustain life.
{52333}{52372}To survive here
{52375}{52463}would require an entirely different|strategy than a tubeworm,
{52467}{52521}a clam, or a shrimp could muster.
{52693}{52809}While most scientists barely noticed this|place on their way to the hot spots nearby, 
{52827}{52882}Seilacher and Rona was search here
{52897}{52952}among the remnants of a dead volcano
{52961}{53027}for their mysterious crop circles of the deep
{53035}{53094}and a creature that thrives were others cannot.
{53184}{53293}We looked in the area people|call the 'valley of paleodictyon'.
{53424}{53547}I was surprised that we should be looking|where there was no obvious life,
{53549}{53624}but that is perhaps the animals' secret.
{54100}{54169}I certainly had not expected to find so many.
{54196}{54278}They were all over the place by the thousands.
{54318}{54425}As soon as I got there and|looked at the hexagon shape,
{54431}{54490}and the arrangement of the holes,
{54509}{54620}I knew this was my paleodictyon nodosum.
{54721}{54795}The creature is probably farming bacteria
{54806}{54861}like the shrimp and the tubeworms.
{54883}{55026}But unlike them, it must be very efficient|because the nutrients are so sparse.
{55189}{55299}We had very little time left so the|sub pilot went to work, right away.
{55316}{55367}After all the trouble of finding them,
{55381}{55447}collecting some samples would be fairly easy.
{56228}{56346}At last, after eight hours in the sub|and 50 years on the cliffs of Spain,
{56355}{56407}we finally had the paleodictyon.
{56454}{56487}It was a great moment.
{57079}{57174}We fully expected the creature to|come swimming out at any moment.
{57206}{57233}But she did not.
{57297}{57343}Then we went in after it.
{57528}{57604}It was important for me that|the tunnels would be there.
{57662}{57703}And the tunnels were there.
{57841}{57908}But not a creature in any of them.
{57994}{58012}Nothing.
{58078}{58180}There have been a dozen dives to the|Valley of the paleodictyon over 10 years. 
{58205}{58267}They have not yet found the animal itself,
{58278}{58325}but they have discovered its secret.
{58348}{58438}They believe the creature is|farming bacteria in its tunnels,
{58458}{58552}and this enables it to live frugally|on the sparse chemical remnants
{58554}{58586}of the dead volcano.
{58639}{58721}Because their tunnels match|those on the cliffs of Spain,
{58731}{58864}it suggests they have outlived|almost all other forms of life on earth.
{58918}{59064}The important thing is that it is still alive|and digging it is wonderful burrows.
{59085}{59199}The same as the fossils I found 50|years ago on my honeymoon.
{59241}{59340}But she is very shy and|we have not seen her.
{59362}{59408}And I probably never will.
{59435}{59547}But that is better, I think, because|I can still imagine anything I want.
{59576}{59613}And my wife, Edith,
{59630}{59735}would have been happy that I never|found my mistress of the deep.
{60052}{60104}As long as we have had eyes to see,
{60121}{60170}we have gazed into the night sky
