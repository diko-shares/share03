00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:07.444
<i>Jules Verne once wrote,</i>

2
00:01:08.027 --> 00:01:10.989
<i>"Put two ships in the open sea</i>

3
00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:13.575
<i>without wind or tide,
they will come together."</i>

4
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:40.268
<i>That's how my parents met.
Like two ships destined for each other.</i>

5
00:01:44.647 --> 00:01:46.900
<i>We are something else.
Try Arthur Treacher...</i>

6
00:01:54.282 --> 00:01:55.283
It's okay.

7
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:07.629
Easy. You weren't breathing.

8
00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:23.353
<i>They were from different worlds.</i>

9
00:02:25.063 --> 00:02:29.317
<i>But life, like the sea,
has a way of bringing people together.</i>

10
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.611
Uh...

11
00:03:15.363 --> 00:03:16.781
I was gonna make you some eggs.

12
00:03:19.242 --> 00:03:20.577
Just don't eat my dog, okay?

13
00:03:24.247 --> 00:03:25.331
It's okay.

14
00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:27.083
I made tea.

15
00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:33.423
Go on, try it.

16
00:03:33.673 --> 00:03:34.757
It'll make you better.

17
00:03:55.904 --> 00:03:57.822
So, uh, who are you?

18
00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:03.536
Atlanna.

19
00:04:05.538 --> 00:04:07.165
Queen of Atlantis.

20
00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:09.834
Wow.

21
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:15.673
I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.

22
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.165
<i>She had fled
an arranged marriage.</i>

23
00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:51.125
<i>Left her whole world behind.</i>

24
00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:55.546
<i>But in my father's lighthouse,
she found something unexpected.</i>

25
00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:02.303
<i>And my father
found the love of his life.</i>

26
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.685
<i>Category 4 Hurricane Arthur</i>

27
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.312
<i>is due to make landfall
sometime after 2:00 p.m.</i>

28
00:05:11.437 --> 00:05:13.606
How about Arthur?

29
00:05:14.357 --> 00:05:15.817
After the hurricane?

30
00:05:15.942 --> 00:05:19.946
After a legend. He's a king, isn't he?

31
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:23.449
He's more than that.

32
00:05:23.574 --> 00:05:26.327
He's living proof
our people can coexist.

33
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:29.747
He could unite our worlds one day.

34
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.759
And the trident could only
be wielded by the strongest Atlantean.

35
00:05:42.218 --> 00:05:47.098
And it gave King Atlan mastery
over the seven seas.

36
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.769
It made him so powerful
that the ocean itself became jealous

37
00:05:51.894 --> 00:05:55.565
and sent a terrible earthquake
to destroy Atlantis.

38
00:05:56.274 --> 00:05:58.568
Down it fell,
to the bottom of the ocean.

39
00:05:58.735 --> 00:06:03.114
But, legend has it
that one day a new king will come

40
00:06:03.281 --> 00:06:05.575
who will use the power of the trident

41
00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:08.536
to put Atlantis back together again.

42
00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:16.544
Take him!

43
00:06:35.146 --> 00:06:36.439
Queen Atlanna,

44
00:06:36.606 --> 00:06:41.277
by the authority of King Orvax,
you are ordered to return to Atlantis.

45
00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:42.737
Atlanna!

46
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.825
<i>But Atlantis' memory is long...</i>

47
00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:52.371
<i>And its king refused to let her go.</i>

48
00:07:05.343 --> 00:07:07.053
- Atlanna!
- Tom!

49
00:07:07.428 --> 00:07:09.305
- My weapon!
- Here!

50
00:07:36.124 --> 00:07:38.876
<i>Their two worlds
were never meant to meet,</i>

51
00:07:39.043 --> 00:07:42.130
<i>and I was a product of a love
that never should've been.</i>

52
00:07:42.255 --> 00:07:44.090
You don't have to do this, Atlanna.
Please.

53
00:07:44.257 --> 00:07:47.593
No. They will always find me.

54
00:07:48.427 --> 00:07:49.887
Next time, they'll send an army.

55
00:07:52.223 --> 00:07:56.519
I have to go back.
It is the only way to save him.

56
00:07:59.856 --> 00:08:01.524
Save you.

57
00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:08.030
Where I come from...

58
00:08:09.824 --> 00:08:12.577
The sea carries our tears away.

59
00:08:15.246 --> 00:08:16.247
Not here.

60
00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:19.250
Here you feel them.

61
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:31.512
I will return to you. When it's safe.

62
00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:33.389
One day.

63
00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:36.434
Right here, at sunrise.

64
00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:40.813
We'll be together again.

65
00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:45.234
You stay strong, my little prince.

66
00:08:45.735 --> 00:08:47.737
I'll always be with you.

67
00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:59.332
Don't let him forget me. Hmm?

68
00:09:24.357 --> 00:09:29.070
All life came from the sea,
so if we want to understand ourselves,

69
00:09:29.195 --> 00:09:30.947
we must journey to where we began.

70
00:09:31.113 --> 00:09:35.910
Now, today, we have better maps of Mars
than we do of our own sea floor.

71
00:09:35.993 --> 00:09:38.037
Come on, closer. Come on, fishy.

72
00:09:38.162 --> 00:09:40.081
- Come on. Come over here.
- Boys!

73
00:09:40.498 --> 00:09:42.583
Stop that. Come on.

74
00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:44.835
Come along.

75
00:09:45.044 --> 00:09:48.172
Bye, fishy. Bye.

76
00:09:48.965 --> 00:09:51.676
My name's Arthur. What's yours?

77
00:09:52.134 --> 00:09:54.595
- You guys hungry? Me, too.
- Check it out.

78
00:09:55.388 --> 00:09:57.682
Arthur is talking to the fish.

79
00:09:57.807 --> 00:09:58.808
Such a freak, Arthur.

80
00:09:58.975 --> 00:10:02.103
- Stop!
- What are you gonna do about it, freak?

81
00:10:02.228 --> 00:10:04.063
Stop it! Don't!

82
00:10:04.188 --> 00:10:05.439
Let me go!

83
00:12:03.057 --> 00:12:04.058
Who are you?

84
00:12:04.183 --> 00:12:05.893
Come on, let's go. Move it.

85
00:12:06.018 --> 00:12:07.978
Come on. Hurry up.

86
00:12:17.363 --> 00:12:18.906
Sir, we've secured the captain.

87
00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:20.241
Distress signal's disabled.

88
00:12:20.366 --> 00:12:22.493
We're running dark again.

89
00:12:22.618 --> 00:12:24.453
But they heard it. You can count on it.

90
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:28.749
I'll make you a deal.
I won't tell you how to captain...

91
00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.669
And you don't tell me how to pirate.

92
00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:44.223
Where's the rest of the crew?

93
00:12:44.348 --> 00:12:46.267
Decided discretion
was the better part of valor

94
00:12:46.392 --> 00:12:48.394
and sealed themselves up
in the torpedo bay.

95
00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:50.062
Our reputation precedes us.

96
00:12:50.146 --> 00:12:51.605
Your reputation.

97
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.023
This is your win.

98
00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.280
Here.

99
00:13:00.906 --> 00:13:02.741
Can't take that piece of junk.

100
00:13:03.242 --> 00:13:04.535
It's the love of your life.

101
00:13:06.162 --> 00:13:08.330
I never told you the story behind it.

102
00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:10.624
This was your grandfather's.

103
00:13:12.126 --> 00:13:15.713
He was one of the Navy's first frogmen
during World War II.

104
00:13:15.838 --> 00:13:20.009
He was so stealthy in the water,
his unit nicknamed him Manta.

105
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.346
But after the war,
his country forgot about him.

106
00:13:24.472 --> 00:13:28.684
So, he went back to the sea,
scavenging and surviving with his wit...

107
00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:30.895
And this knife.

108
00:13:31.395 --> 00:13:34.190
He gave it to me when I was your age.

109
00:13:37.193 --> 00:13:38.819
And now it's yours, son.

110
00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:09.517
Did we just hit something?

111
00:14:11.143 --> 00:14:13.771
No. Something hit us.

112
00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:15.675
Sir, there's something out there.

113
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:16.815
Another submarine?

114
00:14:16.982 --> 00:14:18.692
Uh... No. I think it's a man.

115
00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:08.450
That's not a man.

116
00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:15.916
<i>Alpha, to the right.
Bravo team, sweep the passageway.</i>

117
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:39.481
Permission to come aboard?

118
00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:11.240
Aquaman!

119
00:17:39.977 --> 00:17:42.771
I've waited
a long time for this.

120
00:17:56.577 --> 00:17:58.078
Am I supposed to know who you are?

121
00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:01.331
I scavenge the high seas.

122
00:18:02.541 --> 00:18:03.751
You're the Aquaman.

123
00:18:03.876 --> 00:18:05.794
We were bound to meet at some point.

124
00:18:09.965 --> 00:18:11.258
Let's not make it a habit.

125
00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.010
Up.

126
00:19:07.356 --> 00:19:08.357
Ow.

127
00:19:21.787 --> 00:19:23.163
Dad!

128
00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:26.959
Dad? Ow.

129
00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:30.546
That's your kid?

130
00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:37.010
Shame on you.

131
00:19:39.221 --> 00:19:40.848
Boys got yourselves
into this mess.

132
00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:41.932
Get yourselves out of it.

133
00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:43.016
Bastard!

134
00:19:52.568 --> 00:19:53.777
Dad!

135
00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:03.245
Dad!

136
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.291
Wait!

137
00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:09.126
Help me! He's trapped!

138
00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:10.961
You can't leave him like this!

139
00:20:12.963 --> 00:20:13.964
Please!

140
00:20:14.298 --> 00:20:18.385
You killed innocent people.
You ask the sea for mercy.

141
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:33.358
Get outta here! I got this!

142
00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:34.586
Shut up, I'm not leaving you!

143
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.906
You need to live,
so you can kill that son of a bitch!

144
00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:44.453
- Now, go!
- No!

145
00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.288
- Go!
- Shut up!

146
00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:52.085
No!

147
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:53.670
No!

148
00:21:11.647 --> 00:21:13.231
Damn you!

149
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.691
Go.

150
00:22:33.437 --> 00:22:34.717
I always know where to find you.

151
00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:36.940
Old habits.

152
00:22:46.033 --> 00:22:48.577
- Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
- All right!

153
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.916
You want me to have them
put that in a sippy cup for you?

154
00:22:58.253 --> 00:22:59.853
How is it that I can breathe underwater,

155
00:22:59.963 --> 00:23:01.840
but you can still drink me
under the table?

156
00:23:02.466 --> 00:23:05.177
That's my superpower.

157
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.428
<i>A Russian submarine</i>

158
00:23:06.553 --> 00:23:08.388
<i>hijacked late last night
by high-tech pirates.</i>

159
00:23:09.056 --> 00:23:11.183
<i>The same pirates who are suspected</i>

160
00:23:11.308 --> 00:23:13.988
<i>in connection with the disappearance
of the Navy's highly classified</i>

161
00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:16.605
<i>prototype stealth submarine.</i>

162
00:23:16.688 --> 00:23:19.941
<i>And a further development,
we now have unconfirmed reports</i>

163
00:23:20.067 --> 00:23:23.695
<i>that the metahuman dubbed
by social media as "The Aquaman"</i>

164
00:23:23.779 --> 00:23:25.363
<i>was responsible for this daring rescue.</i>

165
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:27.616
That's not me.

166
00:23:27.908 --> 00:23:31.453
Bullshit. You're doing it,
aren't you? Huh?

167
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.331
What Vulko trained you to do.

168
00:23:34.456 --> 00:23:38.085
I knew you couldn't
stand on the sidelines forever.

169
00:23:38.752 --> 00:23:40.504
Your mother
always knew you were special.

170
00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:41.630
Don't even start.

171
00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:45.050
She believed you'd be the one
to unite our two worlds.

172
00:23:45.175 --> 00:23:46.384
Just stop.

173
00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:53.225
Whatever Atlantis' problems are,
you're bigger than them.

174
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.102
Atlantis murdered my mother.

175
00:23:55.644 --> 00:23:56.895
You don't know that for sure.

176
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.021
Yes, I do.

177
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.234
They killed her.
For loving you and having me.

178
00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:04.486
And you know it.

179
00:24:09.032 --> 00:24:12.077
Son, one day you're gonna
have to stop blaming yourself.

180
00:24:19.042 --> 00:24:20.085
Hey, buddy.

181
00:24:21.628 --> 00:24:23.880
You that fish boy from the TV?

182
00:24:25.173 --> 00:24:26.341
Oh, great.

183
00:24:32.681 --> 00:24:35.600
It's "fish man." What do you want?

184
00:24:36.184 --> 00:24:37.936
I'll tell you what I want.

185
00:24:41.773 --> 00:24:43.358
Could we get a picture with you?

186
00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.402
You're like our local hero, man.

187
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.865
It would mean a lot. Just a quick...

188
00:24:54.578 --> 00:24:55.662
Whatever.

189
00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:57.622
- All right. Let's do this.
- Don't touch me.

190
00:24:57.747 --> 00:24:59.787
Right, that's exactly right.
I'm gonna go down here.

191
00:24:59.875 --> 00:25:01.793
There we go. Everybody smile.

192
00:25:56.014 --> 00:25:58.266
He understands the significance
of this meeting.

193
00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.393
He'll hear you out.

194
00:26:19.996 --> 00:26:22.082
- King Orm.
- King Nereus.

195
00:26:22.499 --> 00:26:25.710
You picked a meeting place
too close to the surface for my liking.

196
00:26:25.794 --> 00:26:27.554
You don't recognize
the Council of the Kings?

197
00:26:28.546 --> 00:26:31.007
In Atlan's time,
when the Seven Kingdoms were one,

198
00:26:31.841 --> 00:26:34.010
our ancestors gathered here.

199
00:26:34.719 --> 00:26:37.097
Atlantis sat here
at the head of the table.

200
00:26:38.098 --> 00:26:40.850
Xebel, as always, by his side.

201
00:26:40.976 --> 00:26:42.936
Brine. Fishermen.

202
00:26:43.061 --> 00:26:44.980
The Deserters and the Trench
had not yet fallen.

203
00:26:45.105 --> 00:26:47.357
The Lost Nation had not yet vanished.

204
00:26:47.482 --> 00:26:50.819
Together, they were the greatest empire
the world had ever seen.

205
00:26:51.194 --> 00:26:55.949
But now, I sit on Atlan's throne,
shackled by archaic laws and politics.

206
00:26:56.074 --> 00:26:57.909
While the threat above us
grows undeniably...

207
00:26:58.034 --> 00:27:00.161
Violence has always plagued the surface.

208
00:27:01.162 --> 00:27:02.539
They will destroy themselves.

209
00:27:02.664 --> 00:27:05.083
Not before destroying us first.

210
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.836
We have been hiding long enough.

211
00:27:08.837 --> 00:27:12.007
The time has come
for Atlantis to rise again.

212
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.551
We honor you, King Nereus,

213
00:27:16.052 --> 00:27:19.431
by inviting Xebel
to be the first kingdom

214
00:27:19.556 --> 00:27:21.558
to join King Orm's alliance.

215
00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:23.601
As if you had a choice, Vulko.

216
00:27:23.727 --> 00:27:25.562
By law,
you need four of the Seven Kingdoms

217
00:27:25.687 --> 00:27:26.771
to ascend and attack.

218
00:27:26.896 --> 00:27:29.649
The Lost Nation and the Deserters
have long perished.

219
00:27:29.774 --> 00:27:31.526
The Trench are nothing but animals.

220
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.487
The Brine will never join you,
and the Fishermen are cowards.

221
00:27:34.654 --> 00:27:39.451
Without me and my army to convince them,
your plans are stillborn.

222
00:27:39.576 --> 00:27:41.911
But I know what you really want.

223
00:27:42.037 --> 00:27:44.497
Once you've obtained
the pledge of the four kingdoms,

224
00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:46.207
you will be ordained

225
00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:48.710
Ocean Master.

226
00:27:50.295 --> 00:27:51.546
That is merely a title.

227
00:27:52.297 --> 00:27:54.174
I'm no fool, King Orm.

228
00:27:54.299 --> 00:27:55.759
As Ocean Master, you'll be commander

229
00:27:55.884 --> 00:27:58.136
of the greatest military might
on this planet.

230
00:27:58.636 --> 00:28:00.388
I am the natural choice to lead it.

231
00:28:02.557 --> 00:28:03.725
Are you?

232
00:28:04.934 --> 00:28:07.395
What about the rumors
that there's another?

233
00:28:07.479 --> 00:28:10.273
An Atlantean, living among the surface.

234
00:28:10.982 --> 00:28:12.776
One of royal blood.

235
00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:17.364
You may sit on the throne of Atlantis,
but your claim to it is weak.

236
00:28:17.447 --> 00:28:19.532
How can you possibly hope
to unite the empire?

237
00:28:19.616 --> 00:28:22.660
My mother's bastard
has never even been to Atlantis.

238
00:28:22.786 --> 00:28:23.995
His loyalty is to the surface.

239
00:28:34.798 --> 00:28:37.092
Surface-dwellers! To arms!

240
00:28:58.071 --> 00:28:59.280
Your king is injured!

241
00:29:58.923 --> 00:30:00.925
I'm not trying to start a war.

242
00:30:01.843 --> 00:30:03.219
The war has already begun.

243
00:30:03.761 --> 00:30:07.015
Then it's time we send them
a message they'll hear.

244
00:30:11.686 --> 00:30:12.854
- I'm good.
- Stop.

245
00:30:12.979 --> 00:30:14.772
- Here're the keys.
- Thank you.

246
00:30:14.898 --> 00:30:16.618
Let's go home
and work on your <i>tā moko.</i> Huh?

247
00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:18.510
If your grandpops was still alive,

248
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.612
he'd be banging our heads
for not finishing it.

249
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.241
Yes, he would,
but there is plenty of time for that.

250
00:30:25.575 --> 00:30:27.952
We gotta get you to bed.

251
00:30:30.455 --> 00:30:31.498
Got it?

252
00:30:38.463 --> 00:30:39.503
I've been looking for you.

253
00:30:39.923 --> 00:30:40.924
Oh, no, no, no...

254
00:30:41.049 --> 00:30:42.717
I need you to come with me to Atlantis.

255
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.511
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you the same thing

256
00:30:44.594 --> 00:30:46.114
that I told that rusty starfish Vulko.

257
00:30:46.596 --> 00:30:48.556
Except nicer, because you're a lady.

258
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.558
No, thank you. I'm not interested.

259
00:30:50.642 --> 00:30:52.727
You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis.

260
00:30:53.853 --> 00:30:55.333
That had nothing to do with Atlantis.

261
00:30:55.396 --> 00:30:59.150
Your half-brother King Orm is about
to declare war upon the surface world.

262
00:30:59.234 --> 00:31:01.027
Billions will die.

263
00:31:01.152 --> 00:31:02.445
Your people and mine.

264
00:31:03.446 --> 00:31:05.073
We must stop him.

265
00:31:09.994 --> 00:31:11.746
And how do you propose we do that?

266
00:31:11.871 --> 00:31:15.083
You are
the firstborn son of Queen Atlanna.

267
00:31:15.208 --> 00:31:17.293
The throne is yours by birthright.

268
00:31:17.585 --> 00:31:22.465
The only way to stop this war
and save both worlds

269
00:31:23.216 --> 00:31:26.135
is for you
to take your rightful place as king.

270
00:31:29.514 --> 00:31:31.874
You think if I just show up,
Orm's gonna give up the throne?

271
00:31:32.725 --> 00:31:35.270
I'm the bastard son of the queen
your people executed.

272
00:31:35.937 --> 00:31:38.356
Trust me. I am no king.

273
00:31:38.481 --> 00:31:39.482
I agree.

274
00:31:39.566 --> 00:31:41.943
That's awesome. Cool.

275
00:31:42.068 --> 00:31:44.654
But, Vulko seems to
believe in you for some reason,

276
00:31:44.779 --> 00:31:45.947
and that's why I'm here.

277
00:31:46.072 --> 00:31:48.783
Vulko has learned of the location
of the Lost Trident of Atlan.

278
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.411
Ooh, fairy tales. It's a myth.

279
00:31:51.536 --> 00:31:52.537
It's not a myth.

280
00:31:52.662 --> 00:31:55.206
With the Sacred Trident,
the people will listen to you.

281
00:31:55.331 --> 00:31:58.334
You can then claim your birthright
and dethrone Orm.

282
00:31:58.459 --> 00:32:01.254
My birthright? It died with my mother.

283
00:32:02.255 --> 00:32:04.674
But I promise you this. If Orm attacks,

284
00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:07.760
I will treat him exactly the same way
your people treated her.

285
00:32:09.178 --> 00:32:10.471
With no mercy.

286
00:33:08.279 --> 00:33:12.659
<i>That submarine was barely operational,
but it served its purpose.</i>

287
00:33:12.784 --> 00:33:15.828
One of your kind intervened.

288
00:33:16.496 --> 00:33:18.456
<i>He is not one of us.</i>

289
00:33:18.581 --> 00:33:21.209
He killed my father.

290
00:33:22.168 --> 00:33:24.504
<i>Our transaction has ended.</i>

291
00:33:28.341 --> 00:33:31.636
Keep the money. I want Aquaman.

292
00:34:42.582 --> 00:34:43.833
Dad!

293
00:34:49.172 --> 00:34:50.173
Dad!

294
00:35:17.742 --> 00:35:18.743
Dad!

295
00:35:23.456 --> 00:35:24.499
Pops!

296
00:35:26.167 --> 00:35:27.168
Pops!

297
00:35:30.421 --> 00:35:32.590
Come on, Pops.

298
00:35:33.591 --> 00:35:36.135
Come on! He's not breathing.

299
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.386
Move! Let me help.

300
00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:46.270
Come on, Pops.

301
00:35:57.949 --> 00:35:58.950
Come on.

302
00:36:13.548 --> 00:36:15.174
I don't even know your name.

303
00:36:15.925 --> 00:36:18.386
It's Princess Y'Mera Xebella Challa.

304
00:36:20.263 --> 00:36:21.389
You may call me Mera.

305
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:24.767
Thank you, Mera.

306
00:36:45.955 --> 00:36:47.290
Dear God.

307
00:36:48.165 --> 00:36:49.709
This was Orm's doing.

308
00:36:51.711 --> 00:36:53.337
The worst is yet to come.

309
00:37:01.345 --> 00:37:02.972
<i>There's a flash flood warning here</i>

310
00:37:03.097 --> 00:37:05.725
<i>that was just extended
for a couple hours.</i>

311
00:37:05.808 --> 00:37:08.394
<i>Unprecedented sights
from all over the world today.</i>

312
00:37:08.519 --> 00:37:12.231
<i>We are seeing warships
and trash washed up by massive waves.</i>

313
00:37:12.356 --> 00:37:15.401
<i>These extraordinary scenes
of coastlines deluged with waste</i>

314
00:37:15.526 --> 00:37:18.029
<i>and garbage are taking place
all over the world.</i>

315
00:37:18.154 --> 00:37:21.157
<i>Decades of pollution
has been thrown back onto land.</i>

316
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.301
<i>Many are asking the question,</i>

317
00:37:22.325 --> 00:37:24.911
<i>"Was this a natural disaster
or something else?"</i>

318
00:37:24.994 --> 00:37:26.871
<i>No. This was no natural disaster.</i>

319
00:37:26.996 --> 00:37:29.290
<i>They threw out our garbage
and our warships.</i>

320
00:37:29.373 --> 00:37:31.792
<i>This was our first contact
with the people of Atlantis.</i>

321
00:37:31.918 --> 00:37:34.921
<i>There you go again
with your insane Atlantean theory.</i>

322
00:37:35.046 --> 00:37:36.797
<i>You have absolutely no proof, Dr. Shin.</i>

323
00:37:36.881 --> 00:37:37.882
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

324
00:37:38.007 --> 00:37:39.800
<i>We already have
an Atlantean living among us,</i>

325
00:37:39.926 --> 00:37:41.344
<i>and his name is Aquaman.</i>

326
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.061
What is it?

327
00:37:50.853 --> 00:37:54.065
This is the exact spot that
Vulko gave me my first swimming lesson.

328
00:37:55.232 --> 00:37:58.527
You have to forget
all the teaching of the surface world

329
00:37:58.653 --> 00:38:02.907
and go deeper to uncover
your Atlantean instincts.

330
00:38:03.366 --> 00:38:04.951
But I already know how to swim.

331
00:38:05.451 --> 00:38:07.119
Not even close.

332
00:38:10.456 --> 00:38:12.208
Just so we're clear,

333
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:14.543
I'll help you stop this war.

334
00:38:15.294 --> 00:38:16.837
But then, I'm done.

335
00:38:17.922 --> 00:38:19.590
Maybe that's for the best.

336
00:38:40.236 --> 00:38:42.238
The ocean is more than
our life source, Arthur.

337
00:38:42.363 --> 00:38:43.739
It is who we are.

338
00:38:43.864 --> 00:38:45.908
Wait, you can talk underwater?

339
00:38:45.992 --> 00:38:49.036
I can talk underwater, too!

340
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:50.871
This is awesome!

341
00:38:51.706 --> 00:38:54.417
Oh, we can do more than just talk.

342
00:39:00.923 --> 00:39:05.970
<i>Being Atlantean means more than
just being able to breathe water.</i>

343
00:39:06.095 --> 00:39:10.683
<i>Your body is equipped to survive
the extreme cold and pressure,</i>

344
00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:13.269
<i>and your eyes adjust to see in the dark.</i>

345
00:39:37.209 --> 00:39:38.461
This is awesome!

346
00:40:06.489 --> 00:40:09.700
So, Vulko, when can I meet my mother?

347
00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:14.413
Soon, my young prince.

348
00:40:14.538 --> 00:40:18.542
When you're ready, I'll take you
to Atlantis to meet the queen.

349
00:40:29.136 --> 00:40:30.721
I hid my ship in here.

350
00:40:32.807 --> 00:40:34.287
Listen,
I'm not getting in that thing.

351
00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:36.495
Well, to get where we're going,
you're gonna have to.

352
00:40:36.519 --> 00:40:38.604
Your fish ship
has been marinating in chum butter.

353
00:40:38.729 --> 00:40:40.449
I'm gonna come out
smelling like swamp butt.

354
00:40:40.481 --> 00:40:42.149
That'd be an improvement.

355
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:49.615
Yup. Okay.

356
00:41:50.801 --> 00:41:52.803
What's the point in
having a bridge underwater?

357
00:41:52.928 --> 00:41:55.055
The Gateway Bridge is a remnant
of the Old World.

358
00:41:55.181 --> 00:41:57.061
It's also the only way in or out
of the Capital.

359
00:41:57.183 --> 00:41:58.577
Why can't they just go over the walls?

360
00:41:58.601 --> 00:42:00.311
Security is impenetrable.

361
00:42:00.394 --> 00:42:02.038
Even if they did
manage to evade the guards,

362
00:42:02.062 --> 00:42:03.731
they'd never get past the hydro-cannons.

363
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:07.776
People try to sneak in all the time.

364
00:42:09.361 --> 00:42:10.696
Yeah, right.

365
00:42:30.925 --> 00:42:32.051
What is this?

366
00:42:32.176 --> 00:42:33.886
Customs and border control.

367
00:42:34.803 --> 00:42:37.556
Don't worry.
I have diplomatic clearance.

368
00:42:45.397 --> 00:42:46.398
Welcome home.

369
00:43:35.197 --> 00:43:37.408
There's a safe house
down in the Old City.

370
00:43:37.533 --> 00:43:40.369
The Highborns
never venture to the sea floor.

371
00:43:40.619 --> 00:43:41.620
We're here.

372
00:44:10.941 --> 00:44:12.234
What is this?

373
00:44:12.735 --> 00:44:15.070
We use this air pocket
as an extra layer of precaution.

374
00:44:15.195 --> 00:44:17.448
Only the Highborns can breathe water
as well as air.

375
00:44:17.614 --> 00:44:19.199
Plus, it keeps the animals out.

376
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.036
They get kind of messy.

377
00:44:24.788 --> 00:44:26.832
Vulko. Here I am, old man.

378
00:44:26.915 --> 00:44:29.710
After all these years,
you finally get what you wanted.

379
00:44:32.504 --> 00:44:36.133
Arthur, I wish it was
under better circumstances.

380
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.344
I can't believe Orm attacked.

381
00:44:38.469 --> 00:44:39.470
It wasn't an attack.

382
00:44:39.636 --> 00:44:41.930
Legally, he's not allowed to yet.

383
00:44:42.056 --> 00:44:45.225
What he did to your surface warships
was merely a warning.

384
00:44:45.351 --> 00:44:46.393
What provoked it?

385
00:44:46.977 --> 00:44:50.481
King Orm and your father
were ambushed by the surface.

386
00:44:50.564 --> 00:44:52.983
By the surface? I don't think so.

387
00:44:53.108 --> 00:44:54.860
They still think
Atlantis is a fairy tale.

388
00:44:55.027 --> 00:44:56.528
I was there.

389
00:44:56.653 --> 00:44:58.572
A surface warship fired at us.

390
00:44:58.739 --> 00:45:01.492
Now, Xebel sides with Atlantis,

391
00:45:01.658 --> 00:45:06.330
giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.

392
00:45:06.538 --> 00:45:10.584
If we're going to prevent this war,
you must dethrone him now.

393
00:45:11.001 --> 00:45:13.670
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't wanna be king.

394
00:45:14.088 --> 00:45:15.422
You don't understand.

395
00:45:16.048 --> 00:45:18.592
Once he is named Ocean Master,
it'll be too late.

396
00:45:18.675 --> 00:45:21.720
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you have ever seen.

397
00:45:22.346 --> 00:45:24.765
I'm from the surface.
No one is gonna take me seriously.

398
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.201
Okay? I don't even know where to begin.

399
00:45:26.225 --> 00:45:28.852
By winning
the hearts and minds of the people

400
00:45:28.977 --> 00:45:33.399
by proving to them that you're worthy,
and retrieving this.

401
00:45:38.278 --> 00:45:39.363
Hmm.

402
00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.782
I already got one of those.

403
00:45:43.075 --> 00:45:45.285
Not like this one, you don't.

404
00:45:45.411 --> 00:45:47.371
This is the Lost Trident of Atlan.

405
00:45:47.996 --> 00:45:49.123
Oh, I know the story.

406
00:45:49.289 --> 00:45:51.959
It's more than a story. It's real.

407
00:45:52.918 --> 00:45:56.630
<i>It was forged by
the greatest weapon masters in history.</i>

408
00:45:57.923 --> 00:46:01.427
<i>Crafted from Poseidon's steel
for King Atlan,</i>

409
00:46:02.428 --> 00:46:04.388
<i>the first ruler of Atlantis.</i>

410
00:46:05.931 --> 00:46:09.726
<i>Legend says the trident was imbued
with the power to command the sea.</i>

411
00:46:11.186 --> 00:46:12.187
So what happened to it?

412
00:46:12.396 --> 00:46:16.108
To know that is to go back to the time
before the Great Fall,

413
00:46:16.733 --> 00:46:19.820
<i>when King Atlan ruled over all that was,</i>

414
00:46:21.029 --> 00:46:23.490
<i>when the kingdoms of Atlantis were one.</i>

415
00:46:26.285 --> 00:46:31.373
<i>It was a time of great prosperity
and technological advancement.</i>

416
00:46:32.666 --> 00:46:35.043
<i>We had unlocked
the secret of unlimited energy</i>

417
00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.547
<i>at a time when the rest of the world
still thought the earth was flat.</i>

418
00:46:41.133 --> 00:46:44.261
<i>But we became too ambitious,</i>

419
00:46:44.386 --> 00:46:46.513
<i>too hungry for power.</i>

420
00:47:03.489 --> 00:47:06.617
<i>The ocean swallowed us,
and Atlantis sank.</i>

421
00:47:08.577 --> 00:47:11.121
<i>But the very power
that collapsed our civilization</i>

422
00:47:11.246 --> 00:47:13.832
<i>also paved the way to our future.</i>

423
00:47:14.625 --> 00:47:17.503
<i>It gave us the ability
to breathe underwater.</i>

424
00:47:18.212 --> 00:47:20.464
<i>And so, we evolved.</i>

425
00:47:21.507 --> 00:47:24.718
<i>Others regressed, became savage.</i>

426
00:47:25.928 --> 00:47:31.016
And the king lived out the remainder
of his days in self-imposed exile.

427
00:47:31.892 --> 00:47:35.562
<i>Neither he nor the trident
were ever seen again.</i>

428
00:47:36.104 --> 00:47:39.983
One of our archeological teams
uncovered this a few months ago.

429
00:47:40.234 --> 00:47:44.112
It's an ancient recording
dating back to the First Dynasty.

430
00:47:44.363 --> 00:47:48.075
I believe it contains
Atlan's final message to his people

431
00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.744
and the whereabouts
of the Sacred Trident.

432
00:47:51.036 --> 00:47:52.454
So, what does it say?

433
00:47:52.579 --> 00:47:55.415
We don't know. The technology's too old.

434
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:58.585
The cylinder bears the markings
of the Deserter Kingdom.

435
00:47:59.253 --> 00:48:01.797
You must take it there
and retrieve the message.

436
00:48:02.005 --> 00:48:05.717
The clue to Atlan's final resting place
is inside of this.

437
00:48:23.277 --> 00:48:26.071
Border Defense.
You are under arrest for illegal entry.

438
00:48:26.238 --> 00:48:27.239
No!

439
00:48:29.116 --> 00:48:30.784
You mustn't be seen here!

440
00:49:26.923 --> 00:49:28.963
I don't suppose
you want to talk about this, do you?

441
00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:35.140
Neither do I.

442
00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:19.810
In the name of His Highness, King Orm,
I place you under arrest.

443
00:50:40.497 --> 00:50:42.082
Welcome to Atlantis...

444
00:50:43.333 --> 00:50:44.334
Brother.

445
00:50:48.922 --> 00:50:51.341
I can't believe you're finally here.

446
00:50:53.093 --> 00:50:55.637
I've heard so many stories about you.

447
00:51:01.601 --> 00:51:04.688
All these years,
I've been ashamed of my mother

448
00:51:04.855 --> 00:51:07.607
for defiling herself
with a surface-dweller.

449
00:51:09.025 --> 00:51:11.987
Ashamed of the fact that I have
a half-breed brother

450
00:51:12.112 --> 00:51:14.823
whose heart
I wanted to run my trident through.

451
00:51:16.032 --> 00:51:20.036
But now that you're finally here
before me, I must admit...

452
00:51:28.044 --> 00:51:29.421
I am conflicted.

453
00:51:29.671 --> 00:51:34.468
You want conflict, why don't you take
these chains off, little brother?

454
00:51:34.634 --> 00:51:36.303
And we'll see who gets run through.

455
00:51:39.014 --> 00:51:42.642
Yes, I see you've brought
our mother's weapon.

456
00:51:43.894 --> 00:51:47.481
Is that why you've come here
after all this time?

457
00:51:47.647 --> 00:51:48.940
To kill me?

458
00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:51.735
I came here to stop a maniac
from destroying the world.

459
00:51:51.902 --> 00:51:52.986
I see.

460
00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:55.739
And how do you plan
to stop the atrocities

461
00:51:55.864 --> 00:51:58.408
that the surface continues to commit?

462
00:51:59.785 --> 00:52:04.247
Because for a century,
they have polluted our waters

463
00:52:05.457 --> 00:52:06.666
and poisoned our children.

464
00:52:07.918 --> 00:52:11.296
And now, their skies burn
and our oceans boil.

465
00:52:13.757 --> 00:52:17.093
And you've come all this way
to take sides against your own people?

466
00:52:17.677 --> 00:52:19.197
There are no sides in a war like this.

467
00:52:19.429 --> 00:52:22.116
You have clearly chosen a side
and come here to challenge the throne.

468
00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:23.934
If that's what it takes
to stop your war.

469
00:52:26.269 --> 00:52:28.939
Are you invoking
the Combat of the Kings?

470
00:52:29.105 --> 00:52:32.317
Call it whatever you want.
I call it an ass-whooping.

471
00:52:33.485 --> 00:52:35.779
Well then,
perhaps that's how we'll proceed.

472
00:52:35.904 --> 00:52:37.531
- Your Majesty!
- Orm, please.

473
00:52:37.614 --> 00:52:38.615
Don't you see?

474
00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.992
If I defeat the firstborn son of Atlanna

475
00:52:41.159 --> 00:52:43.620
in a formal challenge
in front of everyone,

476
00:52:43.745 --> 00:52:48.708
then all Seven Kingdoms will have to
concede that I am the one true king.

477
00:52:48.875 --> 00:52:52.170
Your Majesty, there is no victory
in defeating the ignorant.

478
00:52:52.629 --> 00:52:54.130
Your brother is clearly an imbecile.

479
00:52:55.966 --> 00:52:58.093
Your Highness, he doesn't know our ways.

480
00:52:58.301 --> 00:53:00.220
Then he's about to get an education.

481
00:53:01.888 --> 00:53:03.682
Are you officially challenging me?

482
00:53:03.849 --> 00:53:05.642
Hell yes, I challenge you.
And when I win...

483
00:53:05.851 --> 00:53:07.561
If you win,

484
00:53:07.769 --> 00:53:11.147
I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over.

485
00:53:11.982 --> 00:53:13.483
But if I win...

486
00:53:15.402 --> 00:53:16.403
You're over.

487
00:53:17.362 --> 00:53:18.363
Let's do it.

488
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:19.865
So be it.

489
00:53:20.574 --> 00:53:23.493
Challenge has been made, and I accept.

490
00:53:23.618 --> 00:53:25.412
Prepare him for the Ring of Fire.

491
00:53:26.204 --> 00:53:29.207
Wait. The ring of what?

492
00:53:47.601 --> 00:53:51.313
How could you be so foolish
to let Orm bait you into a fight?

493
00:53:51.438 --> 00:53:53.940
It seems to me
like I just solved all of our problems.

494
00:53:54.065 --> 00:53:56.359
I beat him in a battle, war's over,
I get to go home.

495
00:53:56.443 --> 00:53:58.612
You're a formidable fighter on land,

496
00:53:58.737 --> 00:54:00.947
but here
you're out of your element, literally.

497
00:54:01.156 --> 00:54:03.783
Orm has spent
his entire life underwater,

498
00:54:03.909 --> 00:54:06.328
training to be a warrior,
training to be the best.

499
00:54:07.537 --> 00:54:09.497
You taught me how to fight, Cobra Kai.

500
00:54:09.748 --> 00:54:11.666
Let's see if you remember anything.

501
00:54:15.587 --> 00:54:16.922
So, what's with the big fork?

502
00:54:17.047 --> 00:54:19.507
It's a trident. Now, defend yourself.

503
00:54:53.208 --> 00:54:54.334
What the hell is this?

504
00:54:54.501 --> 00:54:56.962
I'll teach you this move
when you've mastered the trident.

505
00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:08.306
It's not fair.

506
00:55:08.515 --> 00:55:10.850
This thing is so big and awkward.
Why can't I use a sword?

507
00:55:10.976 --> 00:55:14.729
That's your mother's trident.
A traditional weapon of royalty.

508
00:55:14.854 --> 00:55:17.148
You'll never be a king
until you've mastered it.

509
00:55:18.358 --> 00:55:19.878
Why has she never come to see me, huh?

510
00:55:19.943 --> 00:55:21.945
I told you, when you're ready...

511
00:55:22.112 --> 00:55:26.116
Stop lying to me!
I've done everything you ever asked.

512
00:55:26.241 --> 00:55:28.952
And every time I pass a test,
you make up another one.

513
00:55:29.035 --> 00:55:30.328
When am I gonna be good enough?

514
00:55:35.208 --> 00:55:36.501
Does she not love me?

515
00:55:37.293 --> 00:55:39.587
Your mother loved you
more than anything in the world.

516
00:55:40.588 --> 00:55:44.259
But she had to return to Atlantis
to keep you safe.

517
00:55:44.384 --> 00:55:47.470
Her marriage to King Orvax
was arranged a long time ago,

518
00:55:47.595 --> 00:55:49.305
so she had to marry him...

519
00:55:49.472 --> 00:55:51.891
And bear him a son, Prince Orm.

520
00:55:52.809 --> 00:55:55.103
When Orvax
eventually found out about you,

521
00:55:55.228 --> 00:55:57.814
he became overwhelmed with jealousy

522
00:55:57.939 --> 00:56:02.277
and sacrificed her
to the creatures of the Trench.

523
00:56:05.196 --> 00:56:07.449
Are you saying they executed her?

524
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:10.076
Because she had me?

525
00:56:24.883 --> 00:56:26.134
I remember...

526
00:56:26.676 --> 00:56:28.094
Everything.

527
00:56:31.431 --> 00:56:33.558
I have something for you.

528
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:36.436
It belonged to my mother.

529
00:56:37.979 --> 00:56:39.397
Tell me...

530
00:56:41.316 --> 00:56:44.444
Do you think she would have enjoyed
watching her sons murder each other?

531
00:56:46.154 --> 00:56:50.408
I understand your fear
and your reluctance, Mera.

532
00:56:50.575 --> 00:56:53.870
I truly do. I don't want war...

533
00:56:53.995 --> 00:56:55.121
Don't patronize me!

534
00:56:55.246 --> 00:56:56.539
I know you.

535
00:56:56.664 --> 00:56:58.584
What you're doing
flies in the face of everything

536
00:56:58.625 --> 00:57:00.394
that your mother taught us
when we were children.

537
00:57:00.418 --> 00:57:01.419
If she were here...

538
00:57:01.544 --> 00:57:05.632
But she's not here, is she?

539
00:57:05.757 --> 00:57:08.134
What my mother taught us was treason.

540
00:57:09.094 --> 00:57:11.137
Don't follow in her wake.

541
00:57:12.097 --> 00:57:14.217
All right! So, this is
the big, old ring of fire, huh?

542
00:57:15.016 --> 00:57:17.685
How's it work?
I just kick your ass right here?

543
00:57:21.439 --> 00:57:22.774
Vulko.

544
00:57:22.941 --> 00:57:26.653
Will you escort my betrothed
to the royal box?

545
00:57:38.206 --> 00:57:39.541
Let's go, Lady Mera.

546
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:49.801
Down here, we have a legend
about the Karathen,

547
00:57:49.926 --> 00:57:54.681
an ancient sea monster so powerful
that even King Atlan himself feared it.

548
00:57:54.806 --> 00:57:58.768
So, he imprisoned it
in the depths of the ocean.

549
00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:03.356
And in that abyss, the creature
bides its time waiting to rise again.

550
00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:06.568
Atlantis has been lying in wait...

551
00:58:07.485 --> 00:58:09.112
And now, the beast has awakened.

552
00:58:16.119 --> 00:58:21.040
There was a time when
I wanted to meet you more than anything.

553
00:58:22.417 --> 00:58:23.626
Get to know my little brother.

554
00:58:24.669 --> 00:58:28.923
Let him know that he wasn't alone,
that we were in it together.

555
00:58:31.843 --> 00:58:34.387
If only I had known
what a dick you would turn out to be.

556
00:58:37.515 --> 00:58:40.351
You were the reason
our mother was executed.

557
00:58:41.477 --> 00:58:43.730
And I've hated you for it ever since.

558
00:58:46.274 --> 00:58:49.068
But I do not want to kill you, Arthur.

559
00:58:49.944 --> 00:58:52.989
I'm going to give you one chance.

560
00:58:53.823 --> 00:58:55.366
Go home.

561
00:58:56.284 --> 00:58:58.912
Do not ever come back to Atlantis.

562
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:02.999
You are not going to win this.

563
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:07.378
A war is coming to the surface
whether you like it or not.

564
00:59:07.503 --> 00:59:10.798
And I am bringing
the wrath of the seven seas with me.

565
00:59:12.217 --> 00:59:14.177
You know I can't let that happen.

566
00:59:15.511 --> 00:59:16.971
I know.

567
00:59:20.058 --> 00:59:21.392
What the hell is that?

568
00:59:23.519 --> 00:59:24.896
The Ring of Fire.

569
00:59:34.072 --> 00:59:35.073
Yeah!

570
00:59:37.992 --> 00:59:39.661
Yeah!

571
00:59:46.584 --> 00:59:47.835
Shit.

572
00:59:49.212 --> 00:59:51.089
People of Atlantis, hear me!

573
00:59:52.006 --> 00:59:55.593
My brother has come from the surface
to challenge me for the throne.

574
00:59:57.512 --> 01:00:00.556
Let us settle his claim
in the ancient way.

575
01:00:00.807 --> 01:00:05.144
By bloodshed do the gods
make known their will!

576
01:00:14.529 --> 01:00:15.947
Traitor!

577
01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:17.949
Traitor!

578
01:00:23.538 --> 01:00:25.581
You'll never be king!

579
01:00:40.221 --> 01:00:41.907
Never thought I'd see the day
when my own father

580
01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:43.558
would bow before the king of Atlantis.

581
01:00:43.683 --> 01:00:47.562
The surface-dwellers drew first blood.
What would you have us do?

582
01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:49.230
Beg them for mercy?

583
01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:51.691
I detest the surface as much as you do.

584
01:00:51.816 --> 01:00:54.736
But don't you find the timing
of all of this a bit convenient?

585
01:00:58.448 --> 01:01:02.076
But you wouldn't be that gullible,
would you?

586
01:01:04.912 --> 01:01:06.706
You want this war too, don't you?

587
01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:09.560
It is past time the surface-dwellers
learned their place in the world.

588
01:01:09.584 --> 01:01:12.003
If this is how it must be done,
then so be it.

589
01:01:19.052 --> 01:01:20.303
You have our mother's trident.

590
01:01:20.553 --> 01:01:23.556
Powerful, but flawed like her.

591
01:01:24.432 --> 01:01:25.892
I wield my father's.

592
01:01:27.769 --> 01:01:29.020
And it has never known defeat!

593
01:02:17.819 --> 01:02:19.987
I promised Atlanna I'd protect him.

594
01:02:27.537 --> 01:02:30.748
This isn't a competition.
It's an execution.

595
01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:31.452
I am the one true king!

596
01:05:15.162 --> 01:05:17.039
You waiting for an invitation? Get in!

597
01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:29.176
Mera!

598
01:05:32.388 --> 01:05:34.181
Oh, yeah. So, what's the plan?

599
01:05:34.307 --> 01:05:37.351
The plan was to recover Atlan's trident,
then challenge Orm.

600
01:05:37.476 --> 01:05:38.870
Okay, so we're doing things
a little out of order.

601
01:05:38.894 --> 01:05:39.895
Shit happens.

602
01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:47.403
Heads up! We got a bogey on our six!

603
01:05:47.528 --> 01:05:49.739
- What does that even mean?
- Bad guys behind us.

604
01:05:49.864 --> 01:05:51.949
- Then just say that!
- Bad guys behind us!

605
01:07:00.226 --> 01:07:02.287
Whoa, whoa, wait, you said
we couldn't go over these walls.

606
01:07:02.311 --> 01:07:04.039
- I did!
- You said there were hydro-cannons!

607
01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:05.147
I did, now shut up!

608
01:07:09.819 --> 01:07:11.570
Oh, shit!

609
01:07:34.802 --> 01:07:36.220
Shit!

610
01:07:37.012 --> 01:07:38.055
Shit.

611
01:07:38.931 --> 01:07:41.684
We're not dead yet!
But I'm hoping he'll think we are.

612
01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:44.645
Oh!

613
01:07:51.944 --> 01:07:53.195
Here, hold this.

614
01:07:55.364 --> 01:07:56.365
What are you doing?

615
01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.534
- Listen, it worked for Pinocchio.
- Who?

616
01:07:58.659 --> 01:08:01.162
Never mind. Come here, get in. Come on.

617
01:08:03.372 --> 01:08:05.332
Great. So we're getting eaten.

618
01:08:27.188 --> 01:08:28.647
How are you even doing this, anyway?

619
01:08:29.231 --> 01:08:30.524
I don't know.

620
01:08:31.192 --> 01:08:33.527
I can hear them sometimes,
and they can hear me.

621
01:08:33.652 --> 01:08:36.614
Right. Because you're both big,
dumb animals.

622
01:08:36.739 --> 01:08:38.819
- Hey, I just saved your life.
- I saved yours first!

623
01:08:43.537 --> 01:08:45.331
She said, "Coast is clear."

624
01:08:45.539 --> 01:08:47.458
So, where to now?

625
01:08:49.001 --> 01:08:52.338
To the ocean of sand
your people call the Sahara.

626
01:08:53.464 --> 01:08:54.924
All right.

627
01:09:18.572 --> 01:09:20.157
I don't usually take charters,

628
01:09:20.324 --> 01:09:22.204
but I don't usually get paid
in pirate treasure.

629
01:09:22.743 --> 01:09:23.828
Thanks for the ride, buddy.

630
01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:27.206
Oh, man.

631
01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:29.458
Are you okay?

632
01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.752
I've never been so high up before.

633
01:09:33.671 --> 01:09:35.422
Or so far from home.

634
01:09:36.674 --> 01:09:38.259
But at least you have a home.

635
01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:40.302
Not anymore.

636
01:09:40.928 --> 01:09:42.137
I can never go back.

637
01:09:42.555 --> 01:09:45.266
I betrayed everything
when I saved you from the coliseum.

638
01:09:49.645 --> 01:09:52.565
Yeah, but you're engaged to the king.
They have to take you back.

639
01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:55.693
Atlantis is many wonderful things.

640
01:09:55.943 --> 01:09:57.653
But forgiving, it is not.

641
01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:58.863
Yeah, but you're royalty.

642
01:09:58.988 --> 01:10:00.114
So was your mother.

643
01:10:01.615 --> 01:10:04.159
If I went back now,
I'd be sacrificed to the Trench.

644
01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:06.829
Even my own father
wouldn't take me back.

645
01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:13.002
Look on the bright side,

646
01:10:13.168 --> 01:10:15.730
now you don't have to marry some
tool bag that you're not in love with.

647
01:10:15.754 --> 01:10:18.090
My obligation isn't to love.

648
01:10:19.008 --> 01:10:20.843
It is to my family and my nation,

649
01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:23.304
and I've turned my back on both.

650
01:10:25.931 --> 01:10:28.684
Sometimes, you have to do what's right,

651
01:10:29.643 --> 01:10:32.313
even if your heart aches against it.

652
01:10:48.329 --> 01:10:49.955
Your Highness.

653
01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:55.711
The tracker places Princess Mera here,
in the Deserter Kingdom.

654
01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:57.796
You said she was dead.

655
01:10:58.547 --> 01:10:59.882
Apparently not.

656
01:11:01.634 --> 01:11:03.111
Then your brother
still lives as well?

657
01:11:03.135 --> 01:11:04.178
Not for long.

658
01:11:04.303 --> 01:11:06.680
Captain Murk,
assemble a strike force immediately.

659
01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:11.101
No! Mera is to be arrested
and safely returned to me.

660
01:11:11.226 --> 01:11:12.311
She betrayed the throne.

661
01:11:12.436 --> 01:11:13.812
She is a daughter of Xebel.

662
01:11:14.939 --> 01:11:17.816
If any harm befalls her,
our coalition is over.

663
01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.068
Your Highness,

664
01:11:19.151 --> 01:11:22.696
we are now entering
the waters of the Fishermen Kingdom.

665
01:11:22.863 --> 01:11:26.867
Securing the alliance
of the other two kingdoms

666
01:11:26.992 --> 01:11:28.869
should be our immediate concern.

667
01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:36.669
My vizier is correct. As usual.

668
01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:44.385
Arrest them and bring back
King Nereus' daughter unharmed.

669
01:12:07.491 --> 01:12:08.867
We're here!

670
01:12:10.369 --> 01:12:11.620
Hey!

671
01:12:11.704 --> 01:12:13.247
Is there anything nearby?

672
01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.132
Nothing but desert
for hundreds of K's, mate!

673
01:12:15.499 --> 01:12:17.167
- Nothing but desert.
- He's wrong.

674
01:12:17.543 --> 01:12:20.379
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Wait! No! Oh...

675
01:12:23.257 --> 01:12:25.801
She just jumped!
She didn't have a parachute!

676
01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:28.262
Redheads! You gotta love 'em.

677
01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:45.320
Shit!

678
01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.585
Oh, you're crazier than I thought!

679
01:12:59.752 --> 01:13:00.794
A-ha!

680
01:13:02.171 --> 01:13:03.505
This way.

681
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:28.322
<i>You were defeated the last time
because your surface weapons failed you.</i>

682
01:13:29.281 --> 01:13:30.449
<i>Ours will not.</i>

683
01:13:33.952 --> 01:13:35.245
<i>It's prototype armor</i>

684
01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:37.664
<i>for the next generation
Atlantean soldier.</i>

685
01:13:38.457 --> 01:13:41.251
<i>Revenge is something
we Atlanteans understand.</i>

686
01:13:41.376 --> 01:13:44.463
<i>You will lead my finest commandos
as your personal army</i>

687
01:13:44.588 --> 01:13:47.174
<i>to hunt down the half-breed abomination.</i>

688
01:13:47.299 --> 01:13:51.553
<i>I cannot touch them, but you can.
He's fled to your world.</i>

689
01:13:51.678 --> 01:13:54.890
<i>Kill him and the woman he's with,
and you will be rewarded.</i>

690
01:13:55.015 --> 01:13:57.142
Killing him is my reward.

691
01:14:00.979 --> 01:14:02.940
<i>The crown jewel.
Still experimental.</i>

692
01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.486
<i>Converts water
into beams of energized plasma.</i>

693
01:15:19.683 --> 01:15:21.351
Hmm.

694
01:15:21.435 --> 01:15:23.395
I think I'm gonna need a bigger helmet.

695
01:15:24.062 --> 01:15:26.440
One of the tribes of Atlantis
broke off and settled here

696
01:15:26.565 --> 01:15:28.609
when this region
was still an inland sea.

697
01:15:28.734 --> 01:15:31.403
When the water dried up,
they perished along with it.

698
01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:33.113
Perished? Yeah, that's terrific.

699
01:15:33.238 --> 01:15:34.281
We're getting close now.

700
01:15:34.406 --> 01:15:36.742
Oh, yeah? Close to what?
Dying of thirst?

701
01:15:36.867 --> 01:15:38.303
Close to getting punched in the face!

702
01:15:38.327 --> 01:15:40.805
Look, <i>Fight Club,</i> I know you're new
to how things work up here.

703
01:15:40.829 --> 01:15:42.831
Why don't you look around? We are lost.

704
01:15:42.956 --> 01:15:44.559
You see that over there?
Hey, what is that?

705
01:15:44.583 --> 01:15:46.585
<i>Nada.</i> This place is a wasteland.

706
01:15:47.419 --> 01:15:49.671
You're the one who calls
this wasteland a home.

707
01:15:49.796 --> 01:15:51.340
This isn't my home!

708
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:53.359
It's not like the whole surface
looks like this!

709
01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:54.593
Oh, no, of course not.

710
01:15:54.718 --> 01:15:58.472
You've also got disgusting cities
whose sewers empty out into our ocean

711
01:15:58.597 --> 01:16:00.349
and whole mountains made out of trash.

712
01:16:00.474 --> 01:16:01.743
And, oh, you've got great factories

713
01:16:01.767 --> 01:16:03.887
that do nothing
but belch out filth and melt ice caps.

714
01:16:03.977 --> 01:16:05.938
Okay. Point taken. Listen.

715
01:16:06.063 --> 01:16:07.123
Yeah, we got
some idiots running the show,

716
01:16:07.147 --> 01:16:08.791
but we've got
some good things too, all right?

717
01:16:08.815 --> 01:16:11.735
We got green forests and big mountains
and beautiful lakes.

718
01:16:11.985 --> 01:16:14.071
You'd love 'em.
They're like little baby oceans.

719
01:16:14.529 --> 01:16:15.906
Are you trying to provoke me?

720
01:16:16.031 --> 01:16:18.176
I'm just saying you cannot judge a place
before you've even seen it.

721
01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.744
You've judged Atlantis on far less.

722
01:16:24.498 --> 01:16:27.960
No. Would you
just stop it with that? No.

723
01:16:28.168 --> 01:16:31.546
Your stupid Atlantean GPS just told you
to jump out of an airplane

724
01:16:31.672 --> 01:16:33.832
over the middle of the desert,
and now we are stranded.

725
01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:39.304
If you're the next true king,
we're doomed.

726
01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:08.875
That was awesome.

727
01:17:14.339 --> 01:17:16.883
Oh. Look what I found.

728
01:17:18.135 --> 01:17:19.136
What you found?

729
01:17:19.261 --> 01:17:20.262
Yeah.

730
01:17:30.772 --> 01:17:32.399
Check this place out.

731
01:17:33.150 --> 01:17:34.526
This is badass!

732
01:17:36.403 --> 01:17:37.988
This is the Hall of Armory.

733
01:17:38.989 --> 01:17:41.908
Where the legends say
Atlan's trident was forged.

734
01:17:43.618 --> 01:17:45.537
I don't think
they're legends anymore.

735
01:17:51.835 --> 01:17:53.128
Vulko was right.

736
01:17:55.797 --> 01:17:57.090
It's real.

737
01:18:34.503 --> 01:18:35.545
Huh.

738
01:18:36.213 --> 01:18:37.547
Nothing.

739
01:18:38.423 --> 01:18:39.503
Of course it's not working.

740
01:18:39.549 --> 01:18:42.636
It's been sitting here collecting dust
since before the Sahara was a desert.

741
01:18:44.888 --> 01:18:46.264
Man!

742
01:18:46.848 --> 01:18:49.726
"Since before the Sahara was a desert."

743
01:18:49.893 --> 01:18:51.686
Thank you
for repeating what I just said.

744
01:18:51.853 --> 01:18:53.688
It's completely dried out.

745
01:18:55.857 --> 01:18:57.293
Let's just say
you do your best thinking

746
01:18:57.317 --> 01:18:59.069
when you're not thinking at all.

747
01:18:59.319 --> 01:19:00.359
All right, now hold still.

748
01:19:00.404 --> 01:19:02.614
Hey. What are you doing?

749
01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:05.659
We need water,
and you're the closest source.

750
01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.203
Now, hold still.

751
01:19:14.376 --> 01:19:15.419
Hmm.

752
01:19:44.406 --> 01:19:45.574
Show-off.

753
01:19:46.658 --> 01:19:47.951
I could have just peed on it.

754
01:19:58.503 --> 01:19:59.713
King Atlan.

755
01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:06.845
<i>In this trident
resides the power of Atlantis.</i>

756
01:20:07.137 --> 01:20:10.891
<i>In the wrong hands,
it would bring destruction.</i>

757
01:20:11.016 --> 01:20:13.226
<i>But in the hands of the true heir,</i>

758
01:20:13.351 --> 01:20:16.313
<i>it would unite all our kingdoms
above and below.</i>

759
01:20:17.481 --> 01:20:22.277
<i>If you seek my power,
you must prove your worth.</i>

760
01:20:22.402 --> 01:20:25.489
<i>Journey beyond the edge of the world
to the Hidden Sea.</i>

761
01:20:25.822 --> 01:20:28.658
<i>Look inside the bottle
for the charted path.</i>

762
01:20:28.783 --> 01:20:34.581
<i>Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see.</i>

763
01:20:42.881 --> 01:20:44.007
Hmm.

764
01:20:50.805 --> 01:20:52.057
We can't let Orm find this.

765
01:20:54.601 --> 01:20:55.727
Hey! Wait!

766
01:20:56.937 --> 01:20:57.938
What?

767
01:20:58.605 --> 01:21:00.232
Shouldn't we have written it down first?

768
01:21:00.357 --> 01:21:02.234
I memorized it. Didn't you?

769
01:21:03.985 --> 01:21:05.445
Oh, yeah. Totally.

770
01:21:07.155 --> 01:21:08.281
What'd he just say?

771
01:21:10.325 --> 01:21:12.327
"Something something trident."

772
01:21:26.925 --> 01:21:29.636
"Look inside the bottle
for the charted path."

773
01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:37.602
It's our next stop.

774
01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:14.574
I'm starting to think you
actually like these surface-dwellers.

775
01:23:14.699 --> 01:23:17.118
It would be wrong to judge a place
I've never seen before.

776
01:23:19.537 --> 01:23:21.873
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

777
01:23:41.309 --> 01:23:44.437
Well, apparently, it's just right up
on the hill. A big old castle.

778
01:23:45.146 --> 01:23:48.233
And I just learned something
very interesting.

779
01:23:48.316 --> 01:23:49.526
<i>Pinocchio.</i>

780
01:23:50.276 --> 01:23:53.036
You risked our lives based on something
you read in a children's book?

781
01:23:54.572 --> 01:23:57.283
Wait, it's a book?
How about that?

782
01:23:57.450 --> 01:23:58.535
Oh!

783
01:23:58.952 --> 01:24:00.370
I got it from the movie.

784
01:24:06.084 --> 01:24:09.212
King Nereus,
I had hoped our people had evolved

785
01:24:09.295 --> 01:24:11.506
beyond that ancient notion

786
01:24:11.589 --> 01:24:13.758
that war with the surface is inevitable.

787
01:24:13.883 --> 01:24:16.803
It is the position of the Fishermen

788
01:24:16.928 --> 01:24:19.889
that when the time comes
to make ourselves known to the landsmen,

789
01:24:20.014 --> 01:24:23.601
it should be to educate them,
not to destroy them.

790
01:24:25.228 --> 01:24:27.689
I admire your lofty aspirations,
King Ricou.

791
01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:36.489
But I suspect they are but clouds of ink
hiding the heart of a coward.

792
01:24:36.614 --> 01:24:38.241
How dare you!

793
01:24:40.869 --> 01:24:42.829
Please. I implore you.

794
01:24:43.496 --> 01:24:47.125
You're a kingdom of bloated philosophers
and flaccid poets

795
01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:50.462
whose waters have grown stagnant,
and it sickens me.

796
01:24:59.179 --> 01:25:00.472
My King!

797
01:25:00.805 --> 01:25:04.267
The king is dead! Long live his heir.

798
01:25:06.186 --> 01:25:07.228
Princess.

799
01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:11.441
Prepare your armies, Your Highness.

800
01:25:12.233 --> 01:25:15.403
We move against the Brine Kingdom
at once.

801
01:25:23.244 --> 01:25:24.996
What did the recording
say, again?

802
01:25:25.163 --> 01:25:28.166
"Journey beyond the edge
of the world to the Hidden Sea.

803
01:25:28.291 --> 01:25:30.293
Look in the bottle
for the charted path.

804
01:25:30.418 --> 01:25:34.297
Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see."

805
01:25:36.424 --> 01:25:39.135
"Look in the bottle
for the charted path."

806
01:25:41.095 --> 01:25:42.263
Hmm.

807
01:25:44.307 --> 01:25:45.725
Oh, man.

808
01:25:46.392 --> 01:25:47.435
What?

809
01:25:47.644 --> 01:25:49.687
Wow.
That's awesome.

810
01:25:49.854 --> 01:25:51.064
Let me see.

811
01:25:52.524 --> 01:25:54.651
Wow. But how do you know
where to point it?

812
01:25:54.776 --> 01:25:56.069
Here, let me see.

813
01:25:56.194 --> 01:25:57.654
What was the last line?

814
01:25:57.779 --> 01:26:01.241
"Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see."

815
01:26:01.407 --> 01:26:03.076
"Only in the hands of the true..."

816
01:26:04.661 --> 01:26:06.204
Marcus Agrippa.

817
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:08.590
He was a great general,
but he wasn't a king.

818
01:26:10.625 --> 01:26:12.001
Neither was Scipio.

819
01:26:13.378 --> 01:26:14.671
How do you know all this stuff?

820
01:26:14.838 --> 01:26:17.173
Because of my pops.
He made sure I knew my history.

821
01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:22.804
None of these guys are kings,
except this guy. Romulus.

822
01:26:23.471 --> 01:26:25.265
First king of Rome.

823
01:26:27.851 --> 01:26:30.562
"Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see."

824
01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:42.657
There it is. That's our heading.

825
01:26:42.782 --> 01:26:44.492
What? Let me see.

826
01:26:46.786 --> 01:26:47.871
We did it!

827
01:26:47.996 --> 01:26:49.205
Oh!

828
01:26:51.207 --> 01:26:52.917
That's not bad for an imbecile, huh?

829
01:26:55.253 --> 01:26:56.546
Not bad at all.

830
01:27:10.518 --> 01:27:11.644
Mera.

831
01:27:13.938 --> 01:27:19.611
"Loathsomeness waits
and dreams in the deep,

832
01:27:19.736 --> 01:27:24.574
and decay spreads over
the tottering cities of men."

833
01:27:28.453 --> 01:27:29.495
Get back!

834
01:27:35.043 --> 01:27:36.252
Arthur!

835
01:27:39.130 --> 01:27:40.381
I order you to stand down!

836
01:27:40.506 --> 01:27:43.009
Princess Mera, you've been charged
with high treason.

837
01:28:03.404 --> 01:28:04.697
Who the hell are you?

838
01:28:04.822 --> 01:28:06.824
Maybe this will jog your memory.

839
01:28:54.914 --> 01:28:56.249
You're the guy from the sub.

840
01:28:57.125 --> 01:28:58.251
That's right.

841
01:28:59.877 --> 01:29:02.171
But now I have Atlantean steel.

842
01:29:07.969 --> 01:29:10.680
Call me "Black Manta."

843
01:29:26.029 --> 01:29:28.031
You thought you could walk away?

844
01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:35.920
I thought I told you
not to make this a habit.

845
01:29:56.517 --> 01:29:57.643
You can't run.

846
01:29:58.644 --> 01:30:00.855
You owe me blood!

847
01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:02.190
How'd you find me?

848
01:30:02.315 --> 01:30:06.652
Your lady friend has people
who like to keep tabs on her.

849
01:31:23.563 --> 01:31:24.564
No!

850
01:31:59.056 --> 01:32:00.057
Come on.

851
01:32:04.645 --> 01:32:06.564
Everybody, inside.
Get inside.

852
01:32:12.028 --> 01:32:15.781
I'll show you
the same mercy you showed my father.

853
01:32:15.907 --> 01:32:18.492
And gut you like the fish you are!

854
01:34:13.899 --> 01:34:15.151
Arthur!

855
01:34:19.113 --> 01:34:21.115
Mera, they're tracking you.

856
01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:22.491
What?

857
01:34:22.658 --> 01:34:24.327
They're tracking you.

858
01:34:35.338 --> 01:34:38.299
Arthur, stay with me.

859
01:34:39.133 --> 01:34:41.969
Arthur, wake up! Arthur.

860
01:35:30.893 --> 01:35:31.936
Um...

861
01:35:33.646 --> 01:35:35.272
Did you steal a boat?

862
01:35:35.439 --> 01:35:38.442
Are the boats at the marina
not for public use?

863
01:35:38.609 --> 01:35:41.320
No, those belong to people.

864
01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:42.863
Huh.

865
01:35:45.282 --> 01:35:47.034
Those were Orm's elite commandos.

866
01:35:47.201 --> 01:35:49.453
But the one who led them,
he wasn't Atlantean.

867
01:35:50.329 --> 01:35:51.914
I've never seen him before.

868
01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.166
Yeah, I have.

869
01:35:54.375 --> 01:35:56.752
He and his father were pirates.

870
01:35:58.337 --> 01:36:00.464
And he blames me for his father's death.

871
01:36:01.048 --> 01:36:05.261
They picked a dangerous line of trade.
It's not your fault.

872
01:36:06.303 --> 01:36:07.972
That's not how it feels.

873
01:36:10.266 --> 01:36:12.935
It was up to me, and I let him die.

874
01:36:14.228 --> 01:36:15.896
I could've saved him, but I didn't.

875
01:36:17.356 --> 01:36:20.901
And now, I made an enemy,
and he could have hurt you.

876
01:36:21.068 --> 01:36:22.445
And that would have been my fault.

877
01:36:24.572 --> 01:36:26.449
Well, he's behind us now.

878
01:36:27.992 --> 01:36:30.244
It's what lies ahead
that should concern us.

879
01:36:32.246 --> 01:36:35.166
The charted path leads
to the Kingdom of the Trench.

880
01:36:37.209 --> 01:36:39.253
Are those the same creatures
that killed my mother?

881
01:36:40.045 --> 01:36:41.172
Yes.

882
01:36:41.338 --> 01:36:43.507
She was taken there
and sacrificed to them.

883
01:36:43.632 --> 01:36:45.551
It's become a place of death.

884
01:36:45.843 --> 01:36:47.845
We know next to nothing
about what's down there.

885
01:36:52.016 --> 01:36:53.392
We should turn back.

886
01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:57.038
We can still warn the surface.
Try and prepare them for what's coming.

887
01:36:57.062 --> 01:36:58.063
Turn back?

888
01:36:58.230 --> 01:37:01.775
Look, I learned from a young age
not to show weakness.

889
01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:06.071
Okay? I solve my problems
with my anger and my fists.

890
01:37:06.155 --> 01:37:08.115
I'm a blunt instrument,
and I'm damn good at it.

891
01:37:09.158 --> 01:37:12.620
But I've done nothing
but get my ass kicked this whole trip.

892
01:37:13.496 --> 01:37:16.373
I'm no leader. I'm not a king.

893
01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:19.126
I do not work or play well with others.

894
01:37:20.461 --> 01:37:23.589
And I can't let you die trying
to turn me into something that I'm not.

895
01:37:25.090 --> 01:37:28.511
You think you're unworthy to lead
because you're of two different worlds.

896
01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:32.723
But that is exactly why you are worthy.

897
01:37:32.890 --> 01:37:35.309
You are the bridge between land and sea.

898
01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.062
I can see that now.

899
01:37:39.355 --> 01:37:40.731
The only question is...

900
01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.610
Can you?

901
01:38:00.209 --> 01:38:03.712
The tracking on Lady Mera
is still dark, Your Highness.

902
01:38:04.755 --> 01:38:06.090
Vulko.

903
01:38:07.049 --> 01:38:08.592
My trusted vizier

904
01:38:09.134 --> 01:38:12.471
who has stood by the throne
since my father sat upon it.

905
01:38:14.807 --> 01:38:17.476
Have you any advice for me
as this war begins?

906
01:38:17.643 --> 01:38:20.729
I have already given it, My King.

907
01:38:20.854 --> 01:38:23.983
But I will stand by your decision,
as always.

908
01:38:24.775 --> 01:38:26.193
My decision.

909
01:38:28.404 --> 01:38:29.655
To protect it.

910
01:38:32.157 --> 01:38:33.367
While you betray it.

911
01:38:34.827 --> 01:38:38.289
You think I do not know
of your treachery?

912
01:38:38.497 --> 01:38:43.043
That you have remained loyal
to my mother's bastard son.

913
01:38:43.877 --> 01:38:48.924
That you have spent years training him
to take the throne from me.

914
01:38:51.927 --> 01:38:53.512
Do not deny it.

915
01:38:56.682 --> 01:38:57.850
I do not.

916
01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:59.685
Why?

917
01:39:01.312 --> 01:39:03.272
I am the pureblood.

918
01:39:04.148 --> 01:39:06.483
I have devoted my life to Atlantis.

919
01:39:07.443 --> 01:39:10.487
He wanted nothing to do with it.
You swore to serve the throne!

920
01:39:10.571 --> 01:39:11.572
I do serve it.

921
01:39:11.739 --> 01:39:14.283
Arthur may only be half-Atlantean,

922
01:39:14.408 --> 01:39:18.329
but he's already twice the king
you'll ever be.

923
01:39:24.710 --> 01:39:26.045
Take him.

924
01:39:27.546 --> 01:39:29.256
But make sure he has a view.

925
01:41:10.649 --> 01:41:12.109
What the hell are these things?

926
01:41:12.192 --> 01:41:13.986
The Trench! We're here!

927
01:41:16.655 --> 01:41:18.535
- There are too many of them!
- Come on, inside!

928
01:41:28.917 --> 01:41:29.960
They're from the depths.

929
01:41:30.085 --> 01:41:31.587
They're scared of the light. Here!

930
01:41:44.016 --> 01:41:45.267
Come on!

931
01:41:50.147 --> 01:41:51.356
You ready to jump?

932
01:43:00.467 --> 01:43:02.010
Over there!

933
01:43:36.795 --> 01:43:38.130
That thing will tear us apart.

934
01:43:38.797 --> 01:43:40.340
We don't have a choice!

935
01:44:00.485 --> 01:44:02.112
Arthur!

936
01:44:05.449 --> 01:44:06.450
Mera!

937
01:44:37.731 --> 01:44:38.815
Mera!

938
01:44:39.983 --> 01:44:40.984
Mera!

939
01:45:02.798 --> 01:45:03.799
Mera!

940
01:45:06.802 --> 01:45:07.803
Mera!

941
01:45:52.097 --> 01:45:53.306
Arthur.

942
01:45:54.182 --> 01:45:55.434
Mom?

943
01:46:34.139 --> 01:46:38.602
King Orvax sacrificed me
to the Trench, but I survived.

944
01:46:38.769 --> 01:46:41.980
I fought my way through as you did,
and I ended up here.

945
01:46:42.147 --> 01:46:43.774
You've been here
alone for 20 years?

946
01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:45.108
Yes.

947
01:46:45.275 --> 01:46:46.651
Come. Sit here.

948
01:46:51.782 --> 01:46:54.117
You must forgive me.

949
01:46:54.284 --> 01:46:56.244
Forgive me for everything.

950
01:46:57.079 --> 01:46:59.081
This happened because you had me.

951
01:46:59.706 --> 01:47:04.086
Not for having you.
None of this is your fault.

952
01:47:04.544 --> 01:47:07.172
I made a choice. I had to leave...

953
01:47:07.422 --> 01:47:11.301
To save you, to save your father.

954
01:47:13.804 --> 01:47:16.264
Tell me. Tell me about him.

955
01:47:16.807 --> 01:47:18.058
Is he...

956
01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:24.356
He still walks to the end of that dock.

957
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:27.192
Every morning.

958
01:47:30.237 --> 01:47:31.571
Every day.

959
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:36.326
Waiting for you.

960
01:47:44.084 --> 01:47:45.502
Why didn't you ever come back?

961
01:47:51.424 --> 01:47:54.469
Because the portal that brought you here
won't let us return.

962
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:58.431
The trident is the only way back.

963
01:47:59.015 --> 01:48:02.811
But it is guarded by the Karathen.

964
01:48:05.313 --> 01:48:07.607
The creature from our legends,
it's real.

965
01:48:07.774 --> 01:48:10.694
It lies beyond the waterfall.

966
01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:17.117
We'll go with you.
We can fight it together.

967
01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.493
No.

968
01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:20.287
It's too powerful.

969
01:48:20.704 --> 01:48:23.039
I've tried many times over the years.

970
01:48:24.499 --> 01:48:27.752
The creature will only allow
the true king to pass.

971
01:48:30.881 --> 01:48:32.424
You're afraid.

972
01:48:35.135 --> 01:48:36.219
Yes.

973
01:48:37.846 --> 01:48:38.972
Good.

974
01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:41.892
You're ready.

975
01:48:43.476 --> 01:48:45.061
Atlantis has always had a king.

976
01:48:47.022 --> 01:48:48.565
Now, it needs something more.

977
01:48:49.274 --> 01:48:51.193
But what could be greater than a king?

978
01:48:51.818 --> 01:48:52.903
A hero.

979
01:48:54.863 --> 01:48:57.115
A king fights only for his nation.

980
01:48:59.075 --> 01:49:01.161
You fight for everyone.

981
01:50:29.833 --> 01:50:34.212
You do not belong here.

982
01:50:35.797 --> 01:50:42.095
I have guarded the trident
against false kings since the beginning.

983
01:50:42.262 --> 01:50:44.556
And for a thousand years

984
01:50:44.764 --> 01:50:50.270
I have seen the greatest champions
try and fail.

985
01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:56.776
But never have I sensed one
as unworthy as you.

986
01:50:57.193 --> 01:51:04.034
You dare come here
with your tainted mongrel blood

987
01:51:04.242 --> 01:51:07.579
to claim Atlantis' greatest treasure?

988
01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:11.082
So be it...

989
01:51:12.584 --> 01:51:14.294
Half-breed.

990
01:51:33.897 --> 01:51:37.067
You thought yourself worthy?

991
01:51:37.150 --> 01:51:40.236
You thought yourself a king?

992
01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:44.199
You dishonor this place
with your presence.

993
01:51:44.574 --> 01:51:45.700
Stop!

994
01:51:53.416 --> 01:51:56.669
You're right. I am a half-breed mongrel.

995
01:51:58.254 --> 01:52:00.673
But I did not come here
because I thought I was worthy.

996
01:52:00.924 --> 01:52:02.217
I know I'm not.

997
01:52:02.801 --> 01:52:06.721
You understand me?

998
01:52:06.888 --> 01:52:08.306
I do.

999
01:52:08.848 --> 01:52:15.355
No mortal has conversed with me
since King Atlan.

1000
01:52:16.481 --> 01:52:19.734
Who are you?

1001
01:52:20.485 --> 01:52:21.820
I'm nobody.

1002
01:52:24.322 --> 01:52:26.908
I came because I had no choice.

1003
01:52:28.743 --> 01:52:32.997
I came to save my home
and the people that I love.

1004
01:52:35.375 --> 01:52:39.045
I came
because the trident is their only hope.

1005
01:52:39.504 --> 01:52:41.506
And if that's not good enough...

1006
01:52:44.050 --> 01:52:45.510
Then screw you.

1007
01:52:47.679 --> 01:52:54.477
No man has ever freed the trident
from Atlan's grip.

1008
01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:58.440
Should he deem you unworthy...

1009
01:52:58.773 --> 01:53:03.903
Well, I haven't feasted in eons,

1010
01:53:03.987 --> 01:53:06.990
and I am famished.

1011
01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:40.041
The one true king.

1012
01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:55.974
Remember, the Brine
are powerful, savage brutes,

1013
01:54:56.140 --> 01:55:00.144
but a swift assault aimed directly
at their leadership will turn the tide.

1014
01:55:00.311 --> 01:55:01.854
Defeat the Brine King,

1015
01:55:02.063 --> 01:55:05.692
and you will command the greatest
military might on this planet.

1016
01:55:07.777 --> 01:55:09.529
Today, we unite our kingdoms.

1017
01:55:11.364 --> 01:55:12.865
Tomorrow, we scorch the surface!

1018
01:55:14.242 --> 01:55:17.495
Rise, Atlantis!

1019
01:55:35.305 --> 01:55:38.725
Death to the Atlantean hagfish!

1020
01:55:44.105 --> 01:55:46.316
We will not bow to Atlantis.

1021
01:55:46.482 --> 01:55:50.653
We're gonna give them a fight
that they will never forget!

1022
01:56:57.178 --> 01:56:59.931
No! We need him!

1023
01:57:02.183 --> 01:57:03.518
Join me or die.

1024
01:57:03.768 --> 01:57:07.146
You expect me
to address you as Your Highness?

1025
01:57:07.397 --> 01:57:08.690
Not Your Highness.

1026
01:57:10.692 --> 01:57:12.151
Call me...

1027
01:57:13.027 --> 01:57:14.612
Ocean Master.

1028
01:57:14.904 --> 01:57:18.616
You can take my army,
you soft-bellied slug.

1029
01:57:18.783 --> 01:57:21.953
But you will never have my allegiance!

1030
01:57:22.245 --> 01:57:23.329
So be it!

1031
01:57:55.403 --> 01:57:56.571
What the...

1032
01:58:31.939 --> 01:58:33.608
The king has risen.

1033
01:58:41.365 --> 01:58:43.326
Attack!

1034
02:00:42.486 --> 02:00:45.006
There are too many casualties.
We have to stop the fighting now.

1035
02:00:45.114 --> 02:00:48.284
I'll find my father.
But you must defeat Orm.

1036
02:00:49.702 --> 02:00:51.203
And what if I can't?

1037
02:00:51.412 --> 02:00:53.539
Last time, he was in his element.

1038
02:00:54.457 --> 02:00:57.460
This time, make him fight in yours.

1039
02:01:24.612 --> 02:01:25.655
Um...

1040
02:01:26.781 --> 02:01:29.617
- What was the plan, again?
- The plan is to not get killed.

1041
02:01:30.993 --> 02:01:33.412
Yeah, good plan. Don't get killed.

1042
02:02:06.570 --> 02:02:08.531
The Trench! He commands the Trench!

1043
02:02:08.614 --> 02:02:09.991
Impossible!

1044
02:02:27.049 --> 02:02:28.384
Stand down! Let her pass.

1045
02:02:28.718 --> 02:02:31.679
Please, Father, he has the trident.

1046
02:02:31.971 --> 02:02:34.140
I know you think this war is necessary,

1047
02:02:34.432 --> 02:02:36.726
but Arthur is king
by our most sacred law.

1048
02:02:36.892 --> 02:02:38.412
And if you turn your back on that now,

1049
02:02:38.477 --> 02:02:40.771
then the Atlantis you're fighting for
is already dead.

1050
02:02:41.105 --> 02:02:42.106
It's true!

1051
02:02:42.189 --> 02:02:43.869
The half-breed wields
King Atlan's trident.

1052
02:02:43.941 --> 02:02:45.026
He commands the sea!

1053
02:02:47.319 --> 02:02:49.196
Then that half-breed is your king.

1054
02:04:06.607 --> 02:04:08.818
Vulko! Come on, he needs our help!

1055
02:04:08.984 --> 02:04:10.611
We can't! Look.

1056
02:04:10.861 --> 02:04:12.404
The people must bear witness.

1057
02:04:18.828 --> 02:04:20.913
That trident
doesn't change what you are.

1058
02:04:22.039 --> 02:04:23.457
A half-breed bastard.

1059
02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:29.380
Atlantis will never accept you
as its king.

1060
02:04:32.258 --> 02:04:33.467
Well, then by bloodshed...

1061
02:04:35.761 --> 02:04:37.555
Do the gods make known their will.

1062
02:05:07.334 --> 02:05:09.461
Yield the throne. Yield it!

1063
02:06:45.224 --> 02:06:46.267
Finish it.

1064
02:06:46.475 --> 02:06:47.643
Yield the throne.

1065
02:06:47.935 --> 02:06:49.645
Mercy is not our way.

1066
02:06:51.397 --> 02:06:53.315
Maybe you haven't noticed, brother...

1067
02:06:58.904 --> 02:07:00.406
But I'm not one of you.

1068
02:07:00.739 --> 02:07:01.782
Do it!

1069
02:07:04.326 --> 02:07:05.911
- Kill me!
- No!

1070
02:07:08.872 --> 02:07:10.499
That is enough killing.

1071
02:07:18.090 --> 02:07:19.300
Mother?

1072
02:07:19.967 --> 02:07:21.552
Oh, my son.

1073
02:07:30.728 --> 02:07:32.271
It's a long story.

1074
02:07:32.896 --> 02:07:34.315
I'll tell ya later.

1075
02:07:35.274 --> 02:07:36.608
Come on!

1076
02:07:43.282 --> 02:07:46.035
I don't understand. We thought...

1077
02:07:46.243 --> 02:07:47.244
I know.

1078
02:07:47.953 --> 02:07:49.705
Arthur saved me.

1079
02:07:53.584 --> 02:07:55.669
- You're with him?
- I am.

1080
02:07:58.380 --> 02:08:02.676
You're both my children,
and I love you so much.

1081
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:05.554
But you have been misguided.

1082
02:08:07.264 --> 02:08:10.976
Your father taught you
that there were two worlds.

1083
02:08:11.101 --> 02:08:12.478
He was wrong.

1084
02:08:12.936 --> 02:08:15.606
The land and the sea

1085
02:08:16.982 --> 02:08:18.400
are one.

1086
02:08:38.379 --> 02:08:39.546
My queen.

1087
02:08:42.674 --> 02:08:43.884
Vulko.

1088
02:08:46.261 --> 02:08:47.471
Take him.

1089
02:08:48.263 --> 02:08:50.432
But make sure he has a view.

1090
02:08:57.439 --> 02:08:58.440
When you're ready,

1091
02:09:00.943 --> 02:09:02.194
let's talk.

1092
02:09:17.251 --> 02:09:21.004
People of Atlantis,
today began in bloodshed,

1093
02:09:21.171 --> 02:09:23.173
but let it end in joy.

1094
02:09:24.133 --> 02:09:28.178
I give you King Arthur of Atlantis.

1095
02:09:28.554 --> 02:09:30.264
Hail to the king!

1096
02:09:30.431 --> 02:09:32.975
- Hail to the king!
- Hail to the king!

1097
02:09:41.525 --> 02:09:43.694
So, what do I do now?

1098
02:09:44.445 --> 02:09:45.946
Be their king.

1099
02:09:47.197 --> 02:09:48.365
Ooh.

1100
02:09:48.657 --> 02:09:50.784
This is gonna be fun.

1101
02:10:42.794 --> 02:10:45.380
You came back. You're back.

1102
02:10:45.672 --> 02:10:47.799
Yes. Yes.

1103
02:10:53.889 --> 02:10:56.517
<i>My father
was a lighthouse keeper.</i>

1104
02:10:57.518 --> 02:10:59.353
<i>My mother was a queen.</i>

1105
02:11:01.230 --> 02:11:02.689
<i>They were never meant to meet...</i>

1106
02:11:06.318 --> 02:11:08.570
<i>But their love saved the world.</i>

1107
02:11:10.822 --> 02:11:12.741
<i>They made me what I am.</i>

1108
02:11:13.575 --> 02:11:16.954
<i>A son of the land,
and a king of the seas.</i>

1109
02:11:18.914 --> 02:11:20.707
<i>I am the protector of the deep.</i>

1110
02:11:22.459 --> 02:11:23.544
<i>I am...</i>

1111
02:11:25.379 --> 02:11:27.089
<i>Aquaman.</i>

1112
02:14:36.278 --> 02:14:37.279
Hey!

1113
02:14:41.533 --> 02:14:42.784
<i>I spent 15 years</i>

1114
02:14:43.076 --> 02:14:45.495
<i>at the United States Institute
of Marine Science...</i>

1115
02:14:45.662 --> 02:14:48.707
- <i>Weren't you fired?
- ...studying oceanic phenomenon,</i>

1116
02:14:48.874 --> 02:14:51.168
<i>and this is the most conclusive
evidence we have to date.</i>

1117
02:14:51.334 --> 02:14:54.629
<i>Deep-sea seismographs have recorded
explosions on the ocean floor.</i>

1118
02:14:54.796 --> 02:14:56.298
<i>We have satellite imagery</i>

1119
02:14:56.465 --> 02:14:59.092
<i>of debris from Atlantean warships
floating on the surface...</i>

1120
02:14:59.259 --> 02:15:00.979
- <i>Dr. Shin!
- Will you please let me finish?</i>

1121
02:15:01.011 --> 02:15:02.763
<i>Here we go again. Atlantean?</i>

1122
02:15:03.305 --> 02:15:05.807
<i>Yes. The government
does not want us to know</i>

1123
02:15:06.016 --> 02:15:07.452
<i>about the threat
that exists right here...</i>

1124
02:15:07.476 --> 02:15:09.269
Yeah, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1125
02:15:22.199 --> 02:15:23.825
This is Atlantean technology, isn't it?

1126
02:15:24.117 --> 02:15:25.869
Can you tell me how you got this?

1127
02:15:26.036 --> 02:15:28.747
Sure. But first,

1128
02:15:29.498 --> 02:15:32.209
you gotta tell me how to find him.

1129
02:23:12.125 --> 02:23:13.126
[English]
