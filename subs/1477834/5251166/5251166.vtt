Jules Verne once wrote:

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:02.890
"Put two ships in the open sea,

4
00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.695
without wind or tide,
it will come together."

5
00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:30.313
That's how my parents met.

6
00:01:30.753 --> 00:01:33.166
Like two ships destined
for each other.

7
00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:40.426
<i>We are something else.
Try our new features.</i>

8
00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:48.684
It's okay.
It's okay.

9
00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.076
Easy, easy, easy.

10
00:01:58.476 --> 00:01:59.628
You weren't breathing.

11
00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:15.777
<i>They were from
different worlds.</i>

12
00:02:17.758 --> 00:02:22.289
<i>But life, like the sea, has a
way of bringing people together.</i>

13
00:03:05.898 --> 00:03:07.340
Um...

14
00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:10.228
I was going to make
you some eggs.

15
00:03:11.898 --> 00:03:13.639
Just don't eat my dog, okay?

16
00:03:16.852 --> 00:03:18.369
It's okay.
It's okay.

17
00:03:18.393 --> 00:03:20.290
I made tea.

18
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.638
Come on, try it.
It'll make you better.

19
00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:51.108
So, um, who are you?

20
00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:56.474
Atlanna.

21
00:03:58.165 --> 00:03:59.998
Queen of Atlantis.

22
00:04:01.544 --> 00:04:04.656
Wow. I'm Tom.

23
00:04:05.582 --> 00:04:08.342
Keeper of lighthouse. Huh.

24
00:04:39.684 --> 00:04:43.704
She had fled an arranged marriage,
left her whole world behind.

25
00:04:43.754 --> 00:04:45.625
But in my father's lighthouse

26
00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.320
she found something
unexpected.

27
00:04:51.164 --> 00:04:53.174
And my father...

28
00:04:53.198 --> 00:04:55.198
...found the love of his life.

29
00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:03.609
Category 4 hurricane 'Arthur' is
due to make landfall sometime...

30
00:05:03.734 --> 00:05:06.644
You know, how
about <i>Arthur</i>?

31
00:05:06.844 --> 00:05:08.704
After the hurricane?

32
00:05:08.744 --> 00:05:11.179
After our own ancient.

33
00:05:11.203 --> 00:05:13.144
He's a king, isn't he?

34
00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:16.044
He's more than that.

35
00:05:16.254 --> 00:05:19.657
He's living proof our people
can co-exist.

36
00:05:19.684 --> 00:05:22.784
He could unite our
worlds one day.

37
00:05:29.734 --> 00:05:34.471
And the Trident could only be
wielded by the strongest atlantean.

38
00:05:34.804 --> 00:05:39.598
And it gave king atlan
mastery over the seven seas.

39
00:05:39.974 --> 00:05:44.514
It made him so powerful that the
ocean itself became jealous,

40
00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:48.254
and sent a terrible earthquake
to destroy Atlantis.

41
00:05:48.354 --> 00:05:51.177
Oh, down it fell to the
bottom of the ocean.

42
00:05:51.224 --> 00:05:55.345
But, legend has it that one day
a new king will come

43
00:05:55.445 --> 00:05:58.275
who will use the
power of the Trident

44
00:05:58.275 --> 00:06:01.379
to put Atlantis
back together again.

45
00:06:07.304 --> 00:06:09.234
Tom, take him!

46
00:06:27.784 --> 00:06:31.284
Queen Atlanna, by the
authority of King Orvax,

47
00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:34.294
you're ordered to
return to Atlantis.

48
00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:35.822
Atlanna!

49
00:06:38.423 --> 00:06:40.975
But Atlanna's
memory is long.

50
00:06:42.352 --> 00:06:45.737
And it's a king who
refuses to let her go.

51
00:06:58.008 --> 00:06:59.671
- Atlanna!
- Tom!

52
00:07:00.234 --> 00:07:02.360
- My weapon!
- Here!

53
00:07:28.604 --> 00:07:31.434
<i>Their two worlds were
never meant to meet</i>

54
00:07:31.444 --> 00:07:34.444
<i>and I was a product of a love
that never should have been.</i>

55
00:07:34.544 --> 00:07:36.574
You don't have to do this, Atlanna.
Please.

56
00:07:36.614 --> 00:07:38.233
No.

57
00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:40.424
They will always find me.

58
00:07:41.215 --> 00:07:43.106
Next time they will
send an army.

59
00:07:44.724 --> 00:07:46.686
I have to go back.

60
00:07:46.724 --> 00:07:49.694
It's the only way
to save him.

61
00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:54.224
To save you.

62
00:07:58.834 --> 00:08:01.704
Where I come from..

63
00:08:02.104 --> 00:08:05.764
...the sea carries
our tears away.

64
00:08:08.244 --> 00:08:09.981
Not here.

65
00:08:10.005 --> 00:08:12.786
Here you feel 'em.

66
00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:24.934
I will return to you
when it's safe.

67
00:08:25.164 --> 00:08:26.394
One day...

68
00:08:26.434 --> 00:08:29.404
right here, at sunrise

69
00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:33.904
we'll be together again.

70
00:08:35.304 --> 00:08:37.756
You stay strong,
my little prince.

71
00:08:38.413 --> 00:08:41.402
I'll always be with you.

72
00:08:49.094 --> 00:08:51.249
Don't let him forget me.

73
00:08:51.668 --> 00:08:53.455
Hm?

74
00:09:16.882 --> 00:09:19.480
All life came from the sea,

75
00:09:19.504 --> 00:09:21.871
so if we want to
understand ourselves

76
00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:23.869
we must journey to
where we began.

77
00:09:23.894 --> 00:09:26.831
Now today, we have
better maps of Mars

78
00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:28.678
than we do of
our own sea floor.

79
00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:31.023
Come on! Come on!
Come on fishy!

80
00:09:31.734 --> 00:09:33.247
- Come over here.
- Boys!

81
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:35.555
- Stop that.
- Come on!

82
00:09:35.715 --> 00:09:37.755
Hi!

83
00:09:37.904 --> 00:09:39.064
Hi, fishy.

84
00:09:39.744 --> 00:09:41.229
Hi!

85
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:44.574
My name's Arthur.
What's yours?

86
00:09:44.714 --> 00:09:46.814
- You guys hungry?
- Check it out.

87
00:09:46.838 --> 00:09:47.894
Me too.

88
00:09:47.944 --> 00:09:50.202
Arthur is
talking to the fish.

89
00:09:50.284 --> 00:09:52.154
- You're such a prick, Arthur.
- Ah!

90
00:09:52.154 --> 00:09:53.179
Stop!

91
00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:54.738
- What are you gonna do about it? Hah?
- Freak!

92
00:09:54.738 --> 00:09:58.063
Stop it!
Let me go!

93
00:10:53.047 --> 00:10:59.012
AQUAMAN

94
00:11:55.804 --> 00:11:58.663
Who are you?
Let's go! Move it!

95
00:11:59.028 --> 00:12:00.920
Come on, hurry up!

96
00:12:09.954 --> 00:12:11.801
Sir, we've secured the captain.

97
00:12:11.894 --> 00:12:14.928
Distress signal is disabled.
We're running dark in here.

98
00:12:15.094 --> 00:12:17.124
But they heard it.
You can count on it.

99
00:12:17.834 --> 00:12:19.749
I'll make you a deal.

100
00:12:19.904 --> 00:12:21.863
I won't tell you
how to captain.

101
00:12:22.434 --> 00:12:24.564
And you don't tell me
how to pirate.

102
00:12:35.384 --> 00:12:36.827
Where's the rest of the crew?

103
00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:39.139
They've decided discretion was
the better part of valour

104
00:12:39.163 --> 00:12:41.052
and sealed themselvs
up in a torpido bay.

105
00:12:41.054 --> 00:12:42.684
Our reputation precedes us.

106
00:12:42.724 --> 00:12:45.974
Your reputation.
This is your win.

107
00:12:50.564 --> 00:12:52.494
Here.

108
00:12:53.604 --> 00:12:57.534
You take this piece of junk
as a part of your life.

109
00:12:58.704 --> 00:13:01.694
I never told you
the story behind it.

110
00:13:02.044 --> 00:13:04.474
This was your grandfather's.

111
00:13:04.874 --> 00:13:08.389
He was one of the navy's first
frogmen during World War 2.

112
00:13:08.444 --> 00:13:12.662
He was so stealthy in the water.
His unit nicknamed him <i>Manta</i>.

113
00:13:14.184 --> 00:13:16.976
But after the war, his country
forgot about him.

114
00:13:17.024 --> 00:13:20.731
So he went back to the seas,
scavenging and surviving with his wit.

115
00:13:21.864 --> 00:13:26.733
And this knife, he gave it to me
when I was your age.

116
00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.924
And now,
it's yours, son.

117
00:14:00.734 --> 00:14:02.634
We just hit something.

118
00:14:03.434 --> 00:14:07.266
No. Something hit us.

119
00:14:07.266 --> 00:14:09.493
- Sir, there's something out there.
- Another submarine?

120
00:14:09.725 --> 00:14:11.989
Um... no.
I think it's a man.

121
00:14:59.424 --> 00:15:01.414
That's not a man.

122
00:15:04.634 --> 00:15:08.274
Alpha, to the right.
Bravo team, switch the passageway.

123
00:15:30.694 --> 00:15:32.664
Permission to come aboard?

124
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.788
No way!

125
00:17:03.011 --> 00:17:04.011
Aquaman!

126
00:17:33.714 --> 00:17:35.874
I've waited a long time for this.

127
00:17:49.124 --> 00:17:51.160
Am I supposed to know
who you are?

128
00:17:51.894 --> 00:17:54.734
I scavenge the high seas.

129
00:17:55.064 --> 00:17:56.264
You're the Aquaman.

130
00:17:56.304 --> 00:17:59.034
We were bound to
meet at some point.

131
00:18:02.644 --> 00:18:04.498
Let's not make it a habit.

132
00:18:04.652 --> 00:18:06.250
Up!

133
00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:02.029
Ow!

134
00:19:14.614 --> 00:19:16.491
Dad!

135
00:19:17.754 --> 00:19:20.291
Dad? Ow!

136
00:19:22.354 --> 00:19:24.091
That's your kid?

137
00:19:28.324 --> 00:19:29.939
Shame on you.

138
00:19:31.934 --> 00:19:34.724
You get yourselves into this mess,
get yourselves out of this.

139
00:19:34.734 --> 00:19:36.369
Bastard!

140
00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:46.673
Dad!

141
00:19:59.294 --> 00:20:02.049
Wait! Help me!
He's trapped!

142
00:20:02.164 --> 00:20:04.224
You can't leave him like that!

143
00:20:05.694 --> 00:20:06.964
Please!

144
00:20:06.964 --> 00:20:10.887
You killed innocent people.
You ask the sea for mercy.

145
00:20:24.654 --> 00:20:26.302
Get out of here!
I've got this!

146
00:20:26.302 --> 00:20:27.350
Shut up!
I'm not leaving you!

147
00:20:27.438 --> 00:20:28.629
Hey! Hey!

148
00:20:28.654 --> 00:20:31.576
You need to live so you can
kill that son of a bitch.

149
00:20:35.194 --> 00:20:37.430
- Now, go!
- No!

150
00:20:37.454 --> 00:20:39.265
- Go!
- Shut up!

151
00:20:43.792 --> 00:20:45.420
Go!

152
00:20:45.738 --> 00:20:46.881
No!

153
00:21:04.194 --> 00:21:06.094
Damn you!

154
00:21:06.594 --> 00:21:08.264
Go.

155
00:22:25.774 --> 00:22:27.834
I'll always know
where to find you.

156
00:22:28.444 --> 00:22:30.228
Old habits.

157
00:22:38.554 --> 00:22:41.378
- Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
- Oh, yeah!

158
00:22:44.694 --> 00:22:47.714
You want me to have them
put that in a sippy cup for you?

159
00:22:50.834 --> 00:22:52.721
How is it that I can
breathe underwater

160
00:22:52.745 --> 00:22:54.745
but can still drink
under the table?

161
00:22:55.004 --> 00:22:57.711
That's my superpower.

162
00:22:57.961 --> 00:23:01.644
<i>- ... late last night by
high-tech pirates.</i>

163
00:23:01.757 --> 00:23:03.658
<i>The same pirate
who are suspected</i>

164
00:23:03.834 --> 00:23:06.152
<i>in connection with the
disappearance of the Navy's</i>

165
00:23:06.152 --> 00:23:09.022
<i>highly classified prototype
stealth submarine.</i>

166
00:23:09.144 --> 00:23:12.299
<i>And in further development, we
now have unconfirmed reports</i>

167
00:23:12.299 --> 00:23:16.339
<i>that the meta-human dubbed by
social media as the 'Aquaman'</i>

168
00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:18.793
<i>was responsible for
this daring rescue…</i>

169
00:23:19.254 --> 00:23:21.568
- It's not me.
- Oh shit.

170
00:23:21.592 --> 00:23:23.738
You're doing it,
aren't you? Hah?

171
00:23:24.394 --> 00:23:27.294
What Vulko trained you to do.

172
00:23:27.334 --> 00:23:31.234
I knew you couldn't stand
on the sidelines forever.

173
00:23:31.274 --> 00:23:33.416
Your mother always
knew you were special.

174
00:23:33.416 --> 00:23:34.481
Don't even start.

175
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:37.974
She believed you'd be the one
to unite our two worlds.

176
00:23:37.998 --> 00:23:39.888
Please, stop.

177
00:23:42.484 --> 00:23:45.821
Whatever Atlantis's problems
are, you're bigger than them.

178
00:23:46.384 --> 00:23:48.324
Atlantis murdered
my mother.

179
00:23:48.484 --> 00:23:50.486
- You don't know that for sure.
- Yes, I do.

180
00:23:51.424 --> 00:23:53.038
They killed her

181
00:23:53.062 --> 00:23:55.062
for loving you
and having me.

182
00:23:55.594 --> 00:23:57.916
And you know it.

183
00:24:01.604 --> 00:24:04.845
Son, one day you're going to
have to stop blaming yourself.

184
00:24:11.974 --> 00:24:13.914
Hey, buddy.

185
00:24:14.144 --> 00:24:17.805
Are you that fish boy
from the TV?

186
00:24:17.844 --> 00:24:19.661
Oh, great!

187
00:24:25.154 --> 00:24:28.184
It's Fishman.
What do you want?

188
00:24:28.694 --> 00:24:30.754
I'll tell you what I want.

189
00:24:34.204 --> 00:24:36.164
Can I get a picture
with you?

190
00:24:36.164 --> 00:24:38.194
You're like our
local hero, man.

191
00:24:39.134 --> 00:24:42.223
It would mean a lot.
Just.. quick...

192
00:24:47.374 --> 00:24:49.509
- Whatever.
- Alright. Let's do this.

193
00:24:49.509 --> 00:24:50.685
- Dont' touch me.
- That's right.

194
00:24:50.685 --> 00:24:52.553
That's exactly right.
I'd want to go down here.

195
00:24:52.654 --> 00:24:54.823
There we go.
Everybody smile.

196
00:25:48.162 --> 00:25:51.037
He understands the
significance of this meeting.

197
00:25:51.414 --> 00:25:53.747
He'll hear you out.

198
00:26:12.364 --> 00:26:15.304
King Orm.
King Nereus.

199
00:26:15.304 --> 00:26:17.965
You've picked the meeting at a place too
close to the surface of my liking.

200
00:26:18.134 --> 00:26:20.124
You don't recognise the
council of the kings?

201
00:26:21.034 --> 00:26:23.926
King Atlan's times the
seven kings were one.

202
00:26:24.411 --> 00:26:27.063
Our ancestors
gathered here.

203
00:26:27.244 --> 00:26:30.243
Liked to sat here with
the head of the table.

204
00:26:30.544 --> 00:26:33.484
Xebel was always by his side.

205
00:26:33.484 --> 00:26:34.984
Brine, Fishermen,

206
00:26:35.604 --> 00:26:37.818
Deserters and Trench
had not yet fallen.

207
00:26:37.842 --> 00:26:39.842
Lost nation had
not yet vanished.

208
00:26:39.954 --> 00:26:43.758
Together, we were the greatest
empire the world had ever seen.

209
00:26:43.794 --> 00:26:48.488
And now, our throne shackled
by archaic laws and politics,

210
00:26:48.564 --> 00:26:50.605
while the threat above
us grows undeniable.

211
00:26:50.605 --> 00:26:53.128
Violence has always
plagued the surface.

212
00:26:53.834 --> 00:26:55.719
They will destroy themselves.

213
00:26:55.719 --> 00:26:57.903
Not before destroying us first.

214
00:26:57.974 --> 00:27:00.874
We have been
hiding long enough.

215
00:27:01.374 --> 00:27:05.276
The time has come for
Atlantis to rise again.

216
00:27:05.314 --> 00:27:08.305
We honour you
King Nereus…

217
00:27:08.614 --> 00:27:13.814
by inviting Xebel to be the first kingdom
to join King Orm's alliance.

218
00:27:13.824 --> 00:27:16.197
As if you had a choice, Vulko.

219
00:27:16.394 --> 00:27:19.524
By law, you need four to seven
kingdoms to send an attack.

220
00:27:19.734 --> 00:27:22.393
The lost nations and the
Deserters have long perished.

221
00:27:22.464 --> 00:27:24.436
The Trench are
nothing but anglers.

222
00:27:24.534 --> 00:27:27.474
The Brine wouldn't join you, and
the Fishermen are cowards.

223
00:27:27.474 --> 00:27:30.034
Without me and my
army to convince them,

224
00:27:30.574 --> 00:27:32.426
your plans are a stillborn.

225
00:27:32.444 --> 00:27:34.278
But I know what'd
you really want.

226
00:27:34.574 --> 00:27:37.444
Once you've obtained the
pledge of the four kingdoms,

227
00:27:37.444 --> 00:27:39.474
you will be ordained

228
00:27:39.514 --> 00:27:42.229
Ocean master.

229
00:27:42.784 --> 00:27:44.544
That's merely a title.

230
00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.720
I'm no fool, king Orm.

231
00:27:46.894 --> 00:27:51.082
As Ocean master you'll be commander of the
greatest military might on this planet.

232
00:27:51.264 --> 00:27:53.484
I'm the natural
choice to lead it.

233
00:27:55.134 --> 00:27:57.027
Are you?

234
00:27:57.534 --> 00:28:00.020
What about the rumours
that there is another?

235
00:28:00.104 --> 00:28:03.094
An Atlantian living
among the surface.

236
00:28:03.504 --> 00:28:06.044
One of royal blood.

237
00:28:06.444 --> 00:28:08.709
You may sit on the
throne of Atlantis.

238
00:28:08.709 --> 00:28:10.267
But your claim is
too weak.

239
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:12.291
How can you possibly hope
to unite the empire?

240
00:28:12.384 --> 00:28:15.444
My mother's bastard has never
even been to Atlantis.

241
00:28:15.454 --> 00:28:17.034
His loyalty is to the sur...

242
00:28:27.134 --> 00:28:29.994
Surface dwellers!
Launch!

243
00:28:50.724 --> 00:28:52.554
The king is injured!

244
00:29:51.314 --> 00:29:54.254
I'm not trying to
start a war.

245
00:29:54.354 --> 00:29:56.450
The war has already begun.

246
00:29:56.484 --> 00:29:59.899
Then it's time we send them
a message that we're here.

247
00:30:04.282 --> 00:30:05.842
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

248
00:30:05.866 --> 00:30:07.293
- Here's the key. ll
- Thank you.

249
00:30:07.294 --> 00:30:09.709
Let's go home and
work on your...

250
00:30:09.734 --> 00:30:11.334
If your grandpops was still alive,

251
00:30:11.354 --> 00:30:13.663
he'd be banging our heads
when we're not finishing it.

252
00:30:15.234 --> 00:30:18.140
But there's plenty
of time for that.

253
00:30:18.504 --> 00:30:20.582
We've got to
get you to bed.

254
00:30:23.114 --> 00:30:24.973
Got it.

255
00:30:31.154 --> 00:30:33.784
- I've been looking for you.
- Oh no. No. No.

256
00:30:33.794 --> 00:30:35.505
I need you to come
with me to Atlantis.

257
00:30:35.505 --> 00:30:37.274
Listen, I'm gonna tell
you the same thing

258
00:30:37.298 --> 00:30:39.298
I told that rusty
starfish Vulko.

259
00:30:39.434 --> 00:30:41.334
Except, nice way
considering you're a lady.

260
00:30:41.334 --> 00:30:43.164
No, thank you.
I'm not interested.

261
00:30:43.304 --> 00:30:45.915
You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis.

262
00:30:46.474 --> 00:30:48.130
That had nothing
to do with Atlantis.

263
00:30:48.134 --> 00:30:51.825
Your half brother, king Orm, is about
to declare war upon the surface world.

264
00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:55.646
Billions will die.
Your people and mine.

265
00:30:56.114 --> 00:30:58.454
We must stop him.

266
00:31:02.654 --> 00:31:04.614
And how do you
propose we'd do that?

267
00:31:04.624 --> 00:31:07.808
You re the first born son of
queen Atlanna.

268
00:31:07.854 --> 00:31:09.923
The throne is yours
by birthright.

269
00:31:10.164 --> 00:31:12.324
The only way to stop this war

270
00:31:12.334 --> 00:31:15.264
and save both worlds

271
00:31:15.894 --> 00:31:19.351
is for you to take your rightful
place as King.

272
00:31:22.104 --> 00:31:25.330
You think if I just show up,
Orm's gonna give up the throne?

273
00:31:25.404 --> 00:31:28.329
I'm the bastard son of a
queen your people executed.

274
00:31:28.574 --> 00:31:31.265
Trust me.
I'm no king.

275
00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:34.284
- I agree.
- That's awesome. Go.

276
00:31:34.341 --> 00:31:37.549
But, Vulko seems to believe
in you for some reason.

277
00:31:37.654 --> 00:31:38.785
And that's why I'm here.

278
00:31:38.809 --> 00:31:42.091
Volko has learned the location
of the lost trident of Atlan.

279
00:31:42.115 --> 00:31:44.319
Ooh. Fairy tales.
It's a myth.

280
00:31:44.343 --> 00:31:45.563
It's not a myth.

281
00:31:45.564 --> 00:31:47.754
With the sacred trident,
the people will listen to you.

282
00:31:47.894 --> 00:31:50.886
You can then claim your
birthright and dethrone Orm.

283
00:31:51.304 --> 00:31:54.934
My birthright?
It died with my mother.

284
00:31:54.974 --> 00:31:57.163
But I'll promise you this.
If Orm attacks,

285
00:31:57.563 --> 00:32:00.649
I'll treat him exactly the same
way your people treated her.

286
00:32:01.874 --> 00:32:04.560
With no mercy.

287
00:33:01.134 --> 00:33:03.836
That submarine was
barely operational.

288
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.573
But it served its purpose.

289
00:33:05.574 --> 00:33:08.674
One of your kind
intervened.

290
00:33:09.114 --> 00:33:11.420
He is not one of us.

291
00:33:11.444 --> 00:33:14.169
He killed my father!

292
00:33:14.684 --> 00:33:17.624
Our transaction has ended.

293
00:33:20.994 --> 00:33:23.007
Keep the money.

294
00:33:23.024 --> 00:33:25.054
I want Aquaman.

295
00:34:35.134 --> 00:34:36.964
Dad!

296
00:34:41.834 --> 00:34:43.364
Dad!

297
00:35:10.955 --> 00:35:12.656
Dad!

298
00:35:16.034 --> 00:35:17.739
Pops!

299
00:35:18.862 --> 00:35:20.323
Pops!

300
00:35:23.249 --> 00:35:25.671
Come on!

301
00:35:26.254 --> 00:35:28.059
Come on!
Come on.

302
00:35:28.084 --> 00:35:30.483
- He's not breathing.
- Move! Let me help.

303
00:35:37.688 --> 00:35:39.511
Come on, pops...

304
00:35:51.052 --> 00:35:52.911
Oh!

305
00:36:06.024 --> 00:36:07.954
You know, I don't
even know your name.

306
00:36:08.442 --> 00:36:11.395
It's princess Y'mera
xebella challa﻿.

307
00:36:12.924 --> 00:36:14.954
You may call me Mera.

308
00:36:15.894 --> 00:36:17.954
Thank you, Mera.

309
00:36:38.684 --> 00:36:40.532
Dear god!

310
00:36:40.694 --> 00:36:42.814
This was Orm's doing.

311
00:36:44.164 --> 00:36:46.943
The worst has yet to come.

312
00:36:53.934 --> 00:36:55.388
There's a flash flood warning…

313
00:36:55.412 --> 00:36:57.412
90 percent of the building
have been destroyed…

314
00:36:57.904 --> 00:37:01.034
….unprecedented sites from
all over the world today…

315
00:37:01.044 --> 00:37:05.122
we're seeing warships and trash
washed up by massive waves.

316
00:37:05.146 --> 00:37:07.831
These extraordinary
scenes of coastlines...

317
00:37:08.156 --> 00:37:11.214
Governments stated emergency
in multiple countries.

318
00:37:11.284 --> 00:37:13.954
Decades of pollution has
been thrown back on to land.

319
00:37:13.954 --> 00:37:16.708
Many are asking the question:
was this a natural disaster?

320
00:37:16.794 --> 00:37:18.051
- Or something else?
- No, no. No.

321
00:37:18.051 --> 00:37:19.764
This was no natural disaster.

322
00:37:19.794 --> 00:37:21.924
They threw out our garbage
and our warships.

323
00:37:21.934 --> 00:37:24.194
This was our first contact
with the people of Atlantis.

324
00:37:24.204 --> 00:37:27.734
There you go again, with your
insane Atlantean theory.

325
00:37:27.774 --> 00:37:29.704
You have absolutely
no proof, Dr. Shin.

326
00:37:29.704 --> 00:37:30.734
Open your eyes.

327
00:37:30.744 --> 00:37:32.504
We already have an Atlantean
living among us

328
00:37:32.544 --> 00:37:33.974
and his name is Aquaman.

329
00:37:41.854 --> 00:37:43.014
What is it?

330
00:37:43.514 --> 00:37:47.228
This is the exact spot that Vulko
gave me my first swimming lesson.

331
00:37:47.794 --> 00:37:50.814
<i>You have to forget all the
teachings of the surface world.</i>

332
00:37:51.464 --> 00:37:55.824
<i>Go deeper, to uncover
your Atlantean instincts.</i>

333
00:37:55.894 --> 00:37:57.694
But I already know
how to swim.

334
00:37:58.164 --> 00:38:00.164
Not even close.

335
00:38:03.274 --> 00:38:05.332
So, we're clear,

336
00:38:05.456 --> 00:38:07.456
I'll help you
stop this war,

337
00:38:07.902 --> 00:38:09.818
then I'm done.

338
00:38:10.484 --> 00:38:12.950
Maybe that's for the best.

339
00:38:32.504 --> 00:38:35.027
The ocean is more than
our life source, Arthur,

340
00:38:35.051 --> 00:38:36.633
it's who we're.

341
00:38:36.634 --> 00:38:39.174
Wait. You can talk
underwater?

342
00:38:39.174 --> 00:38:42.114
Hey, I can talk
underwater too!

343
00:38:42.114 --> 00:38:43.234
This is awesome!

344
00:38:43.374 --> 00:38:47.426
Oh, we can do more
than just talk.

345
00:38:53.424 --> 00:38:55.520
Being an Atlantean means

346
00:38:55.544 --> 00:38:58.432
more than just being
able to breathe water.

347
00:38:58.732 --> 00:39:03.429
Your body is equipped to survive
the extreme cold, and pressure,

348
00:39:03.429 --> 00:39:06.990
and your eyes adjust
to see in the dark.

349
00:39:29.794 --> 00:39:31.784
This is awesome!

350
00:39:59.084 --> 00:40:00.894
So, Vulko...

351
00:40:00.918 --> 00:40:02.918
when can I meet
my mother?

352
00:40:04.594 --> 00:40:07.076
Soon, my young prince.

353
00:40:07.164 --> 00:40:11.582
When you're ready, I will take you to
Atlantis to meet the Queen.

354
00:40:21.774 --> 00:40:23.594
I hid my ship in here.

355
00:40:25.144 --> 00:40:27.007
Listen. I'm not
getting in that thing.

356
00:40:27.014 --> 00:40:28.842
Well, to get to where we're going,
you're gonna have to.

357
00:40:29.184 --> 00:40:31.243
Your fish ship has been
marinated in chum butter.

358
00:40:31.267 --> 00:40:32.993
I might come out
smelling like swamp Butt.

359
00:40:33.117 --> 00:40:34.617
That'd be an improvement.

360
00:40:40.494 --> 00:40:42.054
Yup.Hm.

361
00:41:43.479 --> 00:41:45.627
What's the point in having
a bridge underwater?

362
00:41:45.627 --> 00:41:47.820
The gateway bridge is
a reminant of the old world.

363
00:41:47.869 --> 00:41:49.854
Source to the only way in
or out of the capital.

364
00:41:49.855 --> 00:41:51.378
Why can't they just
go over the walls?

365
00:41:51.378 --> 00:41:53.046
Security is impenetrable.

366
00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:54.962
Even if they did managed
to evade the guards

367
00:41:54.986 --> 00:41:56.938
they don't get past
the hydro-cannons.

368
00:41:58.674 --> 00:42:00.961
People try to sneak
in all the time.

369
00:42:02.112 --> 00:42:04.043
Yeah, well.
Allright.

370
00:42:23.333 --> 00:42:24.798
What is this?

371
00:42:24.843 --> 00:42:26.593
Customs in border control.

372
00:42:27.508 --> 00:42:30.875
Don't worry.
I've a deplomatic clearence.

373
00:42:38.334 --> 00:42:40.556
Welcome home.

374
00:43:27.814 --> 00:43:29.584
There is a safe house
down in the old city.

375
00:43:30.204 --> 00:43:33.154
The high-borns never
ventured to the sea floor.

376
00:43:33.554 --> 00:43:35.490
We're here.

377
00:44:03.684 --> 00:44:05.261
What is this?

378
00:44:05.324 --> 00:44:07.884
These are air pockets we use as
natural air precaution.

379
00:44:07.924 --> 00:44:09.944
Only the high-borns can
breathe water as well as air.

380
00:44:09.954 --> 00:44:12.324
Plus, it keeps the animals out.

381
00:44:13.064 --> 00:44:15.399
They get kind of messy.

382
00:44:17.194 --> 00:44:19.322
Vulko. Here I am old man.

383
00:44:19.564 --> 00:44:22.790
After all these years,
you finally get what you wanted.

384
00:44:25.274 --> 00:44:28.858
Arthur, I wish it was under
better circumstances.

385
00:44:29.014 --> 00:44:31.074
I can't believe Orm attacked.

386
00:44:31.074 --> 00:44:34.588
It wasn't an attack.
Legally, he's not allowed to yet.

387
00:44:34.654 --> 00:44:38.063
What he did to your surface
warships was merely a warning.

388
00:44:38.101 --> 00:44:39.639
What provoked him?

389
00:44:39.639 --> 00:44:42.934
King Orm and your father were
ambushed by the surface.

390
00:44:43.254 --> 00:44:45.610
By the surface?
I don't think so.

391
00:44:45.694 --> 00:44:47.673
They're still think
Atlantis as a fairytale.

392
00:44:47.673 --> 00:44:49.403
I was there.

393
00:44:49.403 --> 00:44:51.538
A surface warship fired at us.

394
00:44:51.734 --> 00:44:54.664
Now, Xebel sides with Atlantis.

395
00:44:54.704 --> 00:44:58.904
Giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.

396
00:44:59.204 --> 00:45:00.917
If we're gonna prevent this war,

397
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.142
you must dethrone him now.

398
00:45:03.714 --> 00:45:05.314
How many times do
I have to tell you?

399
00:45:05.338 --> 00:45:07.812
- I don't want to be a king.
- You don't understand.

400
00:45:08.644 --> 00:45:11.135
Once he's named Ocean
master, it will be too late.

401
00:45:11.214 --> 00:45:14.214
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you've ever seen.

402
00:45:14.954 --> 00:45:17.434
I'm from the surface. No one's
gonna take me seriously.

403
00:45:17.524 --> 00:45:18.990
Okay? I don't even
know where to begin.

404
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:21.585
By winning the hearts
and minds of the people.

405
00:45:21.682 --> 00:45:25.461
By proving to them that you're
worthy, and retrieving this.

406
00:45:32.634 --> 00:45:34.887
I already got one of those.

407
00:45:35.504 --> 00:45:37.704
Not like this one, you don't.

408
00:45:37.714 --> 00:45:40.644
This is the lost
Trident of Atlan.

409
00:45:40.674 --> 00:45:43.644
- Oh, I know the story.
- It's more than a story.

410
00:45:43.684 --> 00:45:45.274
It's real.

411
00:45:45.614 --> 00:45:49.714
It was forged by the greatest
weapon masters in history.

412
00:45:50.654 --> 00:45:54.019
Crafted from Poseidon's
steel, for king Atlan,

413
00:45:54.916 --> 00:45:57.621
the first ruler of Atlantis.

414
00:45:58.764 --> 00:46:02.804
Legend says, the Trident was build
with the power to command the sea.

415
00:46:03.874 --> 00:46:04.894
So what happened to it?

416
00:46:04.904 --> 00:46:08.409
To know that, is to go back to
the time before the Great Fall,

417
00:46:09.474 --> 00:46:12.953
When King Atlan ruled
over all that was.

418
00:46:13.614 --> 00:46:16.514
When the kingdoms of
atlantis were one.

419
00:46:18.984 --> 00:46:24.383
It was a time of great prosperity and
technological advancement.

420
00:46:25.554 --> 00:46:28.731
We've had unlocked the secret of
unlimited energy at a time

421
00:46:28.731 --> 00:46:31.647
when the rest of the world's still
thought the earth was flat.

422
00:46:33.634 --> 00:46:37.043
But we became
too ambitious,

423
00:46:37.067 --> 00:46:39.664
too hungry for power.

424
00:46:56.184 --> 00:46:59.688
The ocean swallowed us
and Atlantis sank.

425
00:47:00.964 --> 00:47:03.979
But the very power that
collapsed our civilisation,

426
00:47:03.979 --> 00:47:06.164
also paved the way
to our future.

427
00:47:07.464 --> 00:47:10.823
It gave us the ability
to breathe underwater.

428
00:47:10.966 --> 00:47:13.892
And so, we evolved.

429
00:47:14.104 --> 00:47:17.770
Others regressed,
became savage.

430
00:47:18.774 --> 00:47:21.562
And the king lived out
the remainder of his days

431
00:47:21.586 --> 00:47:24.190
in self-imposed exile.

432
00:47:24.554 --> 00:47:28.140
Neither he, nor the Trident
were ever seen again.

433
00:47:28.954 --> 00:47:32.950
One of our archeological teams
uncovered this a few months ago.

434
00:47:33.154 --> 00:47:36.937
It's an ancient recording dating
back to the first dynasty.

435
00:47:37.194 --> 00:47:40.364
I believe it containes Atlan's
final message to his people,

436
00:47:40.394 --> 00:47:43.622
and the whereabouts
of the sacred Trident.

437
00:47:43.624 --> 00:47:45.291
So what does it say?

438
00:47:45.315 --> 00:47:47.938
We don't know.
The technology's too old.

439
00:47:48.104 --> 00:47:51.117
The cylinder bears the markings
of the deserters kingdom.

440
00:47:51.744 --> 00:47:54.729
You must take it there
and retrieve the message.

441
00:47:54.744 --> 00:47:58.832
The clue to Atlan's final resting
place is inside of this.

442
00:48:15.664 --> 00:48:18.885
Border defense. You're under
arrest for illegal entry.

443
00:48:19.372 --> 00:48:20.372
No!

444
00:48:22.144 --> 00:48:23.925
You mustn't be seen here.

445
00:49:19.594 --> 00:49:22.147
I don't suppose you want to
talk about this, do you?

446
00:49:26.604 --> 00:49:28.298
Neither do I.

447
00:50:07.674 --> 00:50:10.358
In the name of his
highness king Orm,

448
00:50:10.382 --> 00:50:13.223
I place you under arrest.

449
00:50:32.734 --> 00:50:35.541
Welcome to Atlantis,

450
00:50:36.704 --> 00:50:38.704
brother.

451
00:50:41.484 --> 00:50:44.608
I can't believe
you're finally here.

452
00:50:45.614 --> 00:50:48.816
I've heard so many
stories about you.

453
00:50:54.154 --> 00:50:55.811
All these years,

454
00:50:56.295 --> 00:51:00.524
I'm ashamed of my mother for
fall in love with a surface dweller.

455
00:51:02.024 --> 00:51:04.608
Ashamed of the fact that I
have a half breed brother

456
00:51:04.632 --> 00:51:08.549
who's heart I wanted to
run my trident through.

457
00:51:08.574 --> 00:51:11.723
But now that you're
finally here before me...

458
00:51:11.774 --> 00:51:13.498
I must admit…

459
00:51:20.254 --> 00:51:22.244
I'm conflicted.

460
00:51:22.254 --> 00:51:24.733
You want conflict?

461
00:51:24.775 --> 00:51:27.137
Would you take these
chains off, little brother?

462
00:51:27.324 --> 00:51:29.912
And we'll see who
gets a run through.

463
00:51:31.594 --> 00:51:35.043
Yes, I see you brought
our mothers weapon.

464
00:51:36.634 --> 00:51:39.991
Is that why you've come
here after all this time?

465
00:51:40.204 --> 00:51:41.734
To kill me?

466
00:51:41.744 --> 00:51:44.505
I came here to stop a maniac
from destroying the world.

467
00:51:44.704 --> 00:51:46.644
I see.

468
00:51:46.644 --> 00:51:48.640
And how do you plan
to stop the atrocities

469
00:51:48.664 --> 00:51:51.780
that the surface
continues to commit?

470
00:51:52.414 --> 00:51:54.966
Because for the centuries

471
00:51:55.008 --> 00:51:57.093
they've polluted our waters

472
00:51:57.854 --> 00:52:00.310
and poisoned our children.

473
00:52:00.794 --> 00:52:04.308
And now, the sky's burned
and our ocean's spoiled.

474
00:52:06.194 --> 00:52:09.819
You've come all this way to take
side against your own people?

475
00:52:09.834 --> 00:52:11.894
There are no sides
on a war like this.

476
00:52:12.104 --> 00:52:14.818
You've clearly chosen a side and
come here to challenge the throne.

477
00:52:14.834 --> 00:52:17.480
If that's what takes
to stop your war!

478
00:52:19.074 --> 00:52:21.704
Are you invoking the
combat of the kings?

479
00:52:21.784 --> 00:52:23.650
Call it whatever you want.

480
00:52:23.674 --> 00:52:25.674
I call it an ass whooping.

481
00:52:26.114 --> 00:52:28.484
Well then perhaps
that's how we'll proceed

482
00:52:28.524 --> 00:52:29.574
- Your majesty!
- Orm please.

483
00:52:29.624 --> 00:52:31.286
Don't you see?

484
00:52:31.294 --> 00:52:36.468
If I defeat the first born son
of Atlanna in front of everyone,

485
00:52:36.494 --> 00:52:39.153
then all seven kingdoms
will have to concede that

486
00:52:39.153 --> 00:52:41.598
I am the one true king.

487
00:52:41.734 --> 00:52:44.675
Your majesty. There is no
victory in feeding the ignorant.

488
00:52:45.364 --> 00:52:47.302
Your brother is
clearly an imbecile.

489
00:52:48.434 --> 00:52:50.829
Your highness, he doesn't
know our ways.

490
00:52:50.844 --> 00:52:53.517
But he's about to
get an education.

491
00:52:54.574 --> 00:52:56.389
Are you officially
challenging me?

492
00:52:56.413 --> 00:52:58.607
Hell, yes! I challenge you.
And when I win...

493
00:52:58.702 --> 00:53:00.571
<i>If</i> you win

494
00:53:00.584 --> 00:53:03.633
I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over.

495
00:53:04.624 --> 00:53:06.676
But if I win,

496
00:53:08.054 --> 00:53:09.798
you're over.

497
00:53:09.994 --> 00:53:12.425
- Let's do it.
- So be it.

498
00:53:13.094 --> 00:53:15.572
Challenge has been made,
and I accept.

499
00:53:16.304 --> 00:53:18.198
Prepare him for
the ring of fire!

500
00:53:18.974 --> 00:53:21.600
Wait. "Ring" what?

501
00:53:40.254 --> 00:53:43.854
How could you be so foolish
to let Orm bait you into a fight?

502
00:53:43.964 --> 00:53:46.924
It seems to me that's
solved all of our problems.

503
00:53:46.964 --> 00:53:49.057
I beat him in battle, the war's over.
I get to go home.

504
00:53:49.064 --> 00:53:51.094
You're a formidable
fighter on land,

505
00:53:51.434 --> 00:53:53.494
but here, you're out of
your element, literally.

506
00:53:53.804 --> 00:53:56.729
Orm has spent his
entire life underwater

507
00:53:56.774 --> 00:53:59.244
training to be a warrior,
training to be the best.

508
00:54:00.374 --> 00:54:02.504
You taught me how
to fight, <i>Cobra kai</i>.

509
00:54:02.514 --> 00:54:05.274
Let's see if you
remember anything.

510
00:54:08.214 --> 00:54:10.911
- So, what's with the big fork?
- That's a Trident.

511
00:54:11.284 --> 00:54:13.084
Now defend yourself!

512
00:54:46.254 --> 00:54:47.293
What the hell is this?

513
00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:49.786
I'll teach you this movement
when you've mastered the Trident.

514
00:54:59.904 --> 00:55:01.394
It's not fair.

515
00:55:01.434 --> 00:55:03.560
This thing is so big and awkward.
Why can't I use a sword?

516
00:55:03.604 --> 00:55:05.264
That's your mother's Trident.

517
00:55:05.534 --> 00:55:07.544
A traditional weapon of royalty.

518
00:55:07.744 --> 00:55:10.498
You'll never be a King
until you've mastered it.

519
00:55:11.184 --> 00:55:12.674
Why'd she never come
to see me, hah?

520
00:55:12.684 --> 00:55:14.695
I told you, when you're ready...

521
00:55:14.719 --> 00:55:16.383
Stop lying to me!

522
00:55:17.084 --> 00:55:18.876
I've done everything
you've ever asked.

523
00:55:18.894 --> 00:55:21.487
And everytime I pass a test,
you make up another one.

524
00:55:21.794 --> 00:55:23.292
When am I gonna
be good enough?

525
00:55:27.894 --> 00:55:29.783
Did she not love me?

526
00:55:29.864 --> 00:55:32.304
Your mother loved you more
than anything in the world.

527
00:55:33.234 --> 00:55:36.842
But she had to return to Atlantis
to keep you safe.

528
00:55:37.004 --> 00:55:40.134
Her marriage to king Orvax
was arranged a long time ago

529
00:55:40.174 --> 00:55:43.293
so she had to marry
him and bear him a son,

530
00:55:43.714 --> 00:55:45.384
Prince Orm.

531
00:55:45.514 --> 00:55:47.780
When Orvax eventually
found out about you,

532
00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:50.329
he became overwhelmed
with jealousy

533
00:55:50.886 --> 00:55:55.044
and sacrificed her to the
creatures of the trench.

534
00:55:57.864 --> 00:56:00.542
Are you saying
they executed her?

535
00:56:01.564 --> 00:56:03.667
Because she had me?

536
00:56:17.714 --> 00:56:20.302
I remember ...everything.

537
00:56:24.024 --> 00:56:26.143
I have something for you.

538
00:56:27.004 --> 00:56:29.341
It belonged to my mother.

539
00:56:30.224 --> 00:56:32.295
Tell me.

540
00:56:33.878 --> 00:56:36.951
Do you think she would've enjoyed
watching her sons murder each other?

541
00:56:38.634 --> 00:56:42.730
I understand your fear,
your reluctance, Mera.

542
00:56:43.074 --> 00:56:44.974
I surely do...

543
00:56:45.404 --> 00:56:48.079
- I don't want war. I...
- Don't patronize me.

544
00:56:48.165 --> 00:56:49.420
I know you.

545
00:56:49.444 --> 00:56:51.372
What you're doing is
against everything

546
00:56:51.406 --> 00:56:53.283
your mother taught us
when we were children.

547
00:56:53.284 --> 00:56:57.672
- If she were here...
- But she's not here, is she?

548
00:56:58.224 --> 00:57:01.163
What my mother taught
us was treason.

549
00:57:01.854 --> 00:57:04.464
Don't follow her wake.

550
00:57:04.464 --> 00:57:07.211
Alright, so this would be
your 'ring of fire', hah?

551
00:57:07.564 --> 00:57:09.181
How is it work?

552
00:57:09.187 --> 00:57:10.922
Keep your
ass right here?

553
00:57:14.274 --> 00:57:19.392
Vulko, will you escort my
betrothed to the royal box.

554
00:57:30.784 --> 00:57:33.361
Let's go, lady Mera.

555
00:57:38.524 --> 00:57:42.298
Down here, we have a
legend called the <i>Karathen</i>.

556
00:57:42.664 --> 00:57:44.608
An ancient sea
monster so powerful

557
00:57:44.632 --> 00:57:46.632
that even King Atlan
himself feared it.

558
00:57:47.634 --> 00:57:49.523
So he imprisoned it

559
00:57:49.823 --> 00:57:52.031
in the depths of the ocean.

560
00:57:52.074 --> 00:57:54.568
And in that abyss, the
creature bides its time

561
00:57:54.592 --> 00:57:56.243
waiting to rise again.

562
00:57:56.244 --> 00:57:58.910
Atlantis has been
lying and wait.

563
00:58:00.184 --> 00:58:02.244
And now the beast
has awakened.

564
00:58:08.554 --> 00:58:10.604
You know, there was a time

565
00:58:11.264 --> 00:58:14.206
when I wanted to meet
you more than anything,

566
00:58:14.934 --> 00:58:16.753
get to know
my little brother,

567
00:58:16.777 --> 00:58:18.958
let him know
that he wasn't alone.

568
00:58:19.904 --> 00:58:22.456
Then we ran in together.

569
00:58:24.544 --> 00:58:27.314
If only I had known what a
dick you turned out to be.

570
00:58:30.284 --> 00:58:33.328
You're the reason our
mother was executed.

571
00:58:34.184 --> 00:58:37.154
And I've hated you
for it ever since.

572
00:58:38.854 --> 00:58:41.006
But I do not want
to kill you, Arthur.

573
00:58:42.624 --> 00:58:44.731
I'm going to give
you one chance.

574
00:58:46.464 --> 00:58:48.518
Go home.

575
00:58:48.969 --> 00:58:51.642
Do not ever
come back to Atlantis.

576
00:58:53.164 --> 00:58:56.034
You re not going to win this.

577
00:58:56.234 --> 00:58:59.773
A war is coming to the surface,
whether you like it or not.

578
00:59:00.174 --> 00:59:03.715
And I'm bringing the wrath
of the seven seas with me.

579
00:59:05.184 --> 00:59:07.067
You know I can't
let that happen.

580
00:59:08.114 --> 00:59:09.856
I know.

581
00:59:12.754 --> 00:59:14.361
What the hell is that?

582
00:59:16.124 --> 00:59:18.340
The ring of fire!

583
00:59:39.184 --> 00:59:41.154
Shit!

584
00:59:41.784 --> 00:59:44.029
People of Atlantis, hear me.

585
00:59:44.397 --> 00:59:46.568
My brother has come
from the surface

586
00:59:46.568 --> 00:59:48.886
to challenge me
for the throne!

587
00:59:50.194 --> 00:59:53.455
Let us settle this
in the ancient way.

588
00:59:53.564 --> 00:59:57.827
By bloodshed till the gods
make known their will!

589
01:00:07.059 --> 01:00:09.331
Traitor!

590
01:00:09.342 --> 01:00:11.247
Traitor!

591
01:00:15.625 --> 01:00:18.102
You'll get a beating!

592
01:00:32.634 --> 01:00:34.504
Never thought I'd see the
day when my own father

593
01:00:34.504 --> 01:00:36.497
would bow before the
king of Atlantis.

594
01:00:36.504 --> 01:00:38.400
The surface dwellers
drew first blood.

595
01:00:39.304 --> 01:00:41.615
What would you have us do?
Beg them for mercy?

596
01:00:42.074 --> 01:00:44.074
I detest the surface
as much as you do.

597
01:00:44.214 --> 01:00:48.020
But don't you find the timing of
all of this a bit convenient?

598
01:00:51.384 --> 01:00:54.312
You wouldn't be that
gullible, would you?

599
01:00:57.424 --> 01:00:59.484
You want this war
too, don't you?

600
01:00:59.524 --> 01:01:02.394
It's past time the surface dwellers
learn their place in the world.

601
01:01:02.394 --> 01:01:05.275
If this is I must be
done, then so be it.

602
01:01:11.504 --> 01:01:13.232
You have my mother's trident.

603
01:01:13.251 --> 01:01:16.334
Powerful...
but flawed like her.

604
01:01:17.344 --> 01:01:19.270
I wield my father's,

605
01:01:19.784 --> 01:01:21.776
and it has never known defeat!

606
01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.564
I promised Atlanna
I would protect him.

607
01:02:19.844 --> 01:02:23.487
This isn't a competition.
It's an execution.

608
01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:24.068
I am the one true king!

609
01:05:07.574 --> 01:05:09.850
You waiting for an invitation?
Get in!

610
01:05:20.376 --> 01:05:22.424
Mera!

611
01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:26.933
Hell, yeah!
So what's the plan?

612
01:05:26.933 --> 01:05:30.139
The plan was to recover Atlan's
trident, then challenge Orm.

613
01:05:30.155 --> 01:05:32.599
Ok. So we do things not in order.
Shit happens.

614
01:05:38.304 --> 01:05:40.168
Heads up. We've got
a bogey on our six!

615
01:05:40.192 --> 01:05:42.114
- What does that even mean?
- Bad guys behind us.

616
01:05:42.574 --> 01:05:45.374
- Then just say that!
- Bad guys behind us!

617
01:06:52.728 --> 01:06:54.983
Woah, woah, wait. You said we
shouldn't go over these walls

618
01:06:55.007 --> 01:06:56.669
- I did!
- You said they're hydro-cannons!

619
01:06:56.669 --> 01:06:58.144
I did!
Just shut up!

620
01:07:03.376 --> 01:07:04.681
Oh, shit!

621
01:07:31.154 --> 01:07:32.932
We are not dead yet!

622
01:07:32.956 --> 01:07:34.469
...

623
01:07:36.054 --> 01:07:37.408
Jump!

624
01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:46.351
Here, hold this.

625
01:07:48.204 --> 01:07:50.494
- What are you doing?
- Listen, it worked for Pinnochio.

626
01:07:50.604 --> 01:07:52.883
- Who?
- Never mind, come here. Get in.

627
01:07:52.907 --> 01:07:54.583
Come on!

628
01:07:55.944 --> 01:07:58.474
Great! So, we're
getting eaten.

629
01:08:19.934 --> 01:08:21.720
How'd you even
doing this anyway?

630
01:08:21.844 --> 01:08:23.658
I don't know.

631
01:08:23.682 --> 01:08:25.744
I can hear them sometimes..
and they can hear me.

632
01:08:26.244 --> 01:08:28.874
Right, 'cause you're
both big dumb animals.

633
01:08:28.874 --> 01:08:31.309
- Hey, I just saved your life.
- I saved yours first!

634
01:08:36.414 --> 01:08:40.030
He said, coast is clear.
So, where to now?

635
01:08:41.654 --> 01:08:45.385
To the ocean of sand your
people called <i>the Sahara</i>.

636
01:08:46.124 --> 01:08:47.954
Alright.

637
01:09:10.856 --> 01:09:13.075
This plane isn't a passenger one,

638
01:09:13.075 --> 01:09:14.837
hence we get paid
in pirate tresure.

639
01:09:14.937 --> 01:09:16.632
Thanks for the ride buddy.

640
01:09:18.579 --> 01:09:20.050
Oh, my god...

641
01:09:20.294 --> 01:09:21.953
Are you okay?

642
01:09:22.434 --> 01:09:24.518
I've never been so high up.

643
01:09:26.304 --> 01:09:28.464
We're so far from home.

644
01:09:29.434 --> 01:09:31.494
At least you have a home.

645
01:09:31.957 --> 01:09:33.612
Not anymore.

646
01:09:33.637 --> 01:09:35.189
I can never go back.

647
01:09:35.214 --> 01:09:38.304
I betrayed everything when I
saved you from the Coliseum.

648
01:09:42.384 --> 01:09:45.474
Yeah, but you're engaged with the king.
They have to take you back.

649
01:09:45.524 --> 01:09:48.494
Atlantis has many
wonderful things.

650
01:09:48.524 --> 01:09:51.494
- But forgiving does not.
- But you're royalty.

651
01:09:51.524 --> 01:09:53.264
So was your mother.

652
01:09:54.264 --> 01:09:57.084
If I go back now, I would
be sacrificed to the trench.

653
01:09:57.094 --> 01:10:00.092
Even my own father
wouldn't take me back.

654
01:10:02.051 --> 01:10:04.019
Well, you know...

655
01:10:04.297 --> 01:10:05.880
look on the bright side.

656
01:10:05.904 --> 01:10:08.749
Now you don't have to marry someone
that you're not in love with.

657
01:10:08.774 --> 01:10:11.122
My obligation isn't a love.

658
01:10:11.644 --> 01:10:13.587
This is my family
and my nation,

659
01:10:13.884 --> 01:10:15.974
and I've turned
my back on both.

660
01:10:18.454 --> 01:10:21.315
Sometimes we have
to do what's right,

661
01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:25.653
even if our heart
aches against it.

662
01:10:41.187 --> 01:10:42.524
Your highness!

663
01:10:43.574 --> 01:10:45.634
The tracking puts
princess Mera here,

664
01:10:46.844 --> 01:10:48.646
in the deserter kingdom.

665
01:10:49.314 --> 01:10:51.150
You said she was dead.

666
01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:53.149
Apparently not.

667
01:10:53.984 --> 01:10:55.914
Does your brother
still lives as well?

668
01:10:55.914 --> 01:10:57.193
Not for long.

669
01:10:57.194 --> 01:10:59.356
Captain Murk, assemble
a strike force immediately.

670
01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.629
No! Mira is to be arrested

671
01:11:02.029 --> 01:11:04.849
- and safely returned to me.
- She betrayed the throne…

672
01:11:04.849 --> 01:11:06.701
She's a daughter of Xebel.

673
01:11:07.604 --> 01:11:10.440
If any harm befalls her,
our coalition is over.

674
01:11:10.534 --> 01:11:12.081
Your highness..

675
01:11:12.105 --> 01:11:15.263
We are now entering the waters
of the Fishermen kingdom.

676
01:11:15.874 --> 01:11:18.710
Securing the alliance of
the other two kingdoms

677
01:11:19.834 --> 01:11:21.771
should be our
immediate concern.

678
01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:27.273
My vizier is correct

679
01:11:28.533 --> 01:11:30.267
as usual.

680
01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:32.973
Arrest them

681
01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:36.995
and bring back King
Nereus's daughter unharmed.

682
01:12:00.184 --> 01:12:01.744
We're here.

683
01:12:03.324 --> 01:12:05.571
Hey, is there anything nearby?

684
01:12:05.624 --> 01:12:08.143
Nothing but deserts for
hundreds of Ks, mate.

685
01:12:08.167 --> 01:12:10.110
- Nothing but deserts...
- He's wrong!

686
01:12:10.256 --> 01:12:12.066
Hey! What are you doing?

687
01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:14.090
Mera, wait, wait!
No!

688
01:12:15.674 --> 01:12:18.394
- What the...?
- She just jumped without a parachute.

689
01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:21.046
Redheads, you
got to love 'em.

690
01:12:36.462 --> 01:12:37.769
Shit!

691
01:12:50.434 --> 01:12:52.256
Oh, you're crazier
than I thought.

692
01:12:53.019 --> 01:12:54.185
A-ha!

693
01:12:54.844 --> 01:12:56.204
This way.

694
01:13:17.694 --> 01:13:21.074
You were defeated the last time because
your surface weapons failed you.

695
01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:23.740
Ours will not.

696
01:13:26.274 --> 01:13:29.934
It's prototype armour for the next
generation Atlantean soldier.

697
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:33.684
Revenge is something we
Atlanteans understand.

698
01:13:34.184 --> 01:13:37.314
You will lead my finest
commandoes as your personal army

699
01:13:37.314 --> 01:13:39.374
to hunt the half
breed abomination.

700
01:13:39.824 --> 01:13:42.384
I can't touch them but you can.

701
01:13:42.424 --> 01:13:44.324
He's fled to your world.

702
01:13:44.324 --> 01:13:47.640
Kill him and the woman he's with
and you will be rewarded.

703
01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.897
Killing him is my reward.

704
01:13:53.534 --> 01:13:56.161
The crown jewel is
too experimental.

705
01:13:57.304 --> 01:13:59.990
It converges water into beams
of energised plasma.

706
01:15:12.244 --> 01:15:13.633
Hmm...

707
01:15:13.989 --> 01:15:16.235
I think I'm gonna
need a bigger helmet.

708
01:15:16.635 --> 01:15:19.175
One of the tribes of Atlantis
broke off and settled here

709
01:15:19.299 --> 01:15:21.177
when the region was
still an inland sea.

710
01:15:21.204 --> 01:15:23.769
When the water dried up,
they perished along with it.

711
01:15:23.994 --> 01:15:25.954
Perished?
Yeah, that's perfect.

712
01:15:25.964 --> 01:15:28.024
- We're getting close now.
- Oh, yeah? Close to what?

713
01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.298
Dying of thirst?

714
01:15:29.322 --> 01:15:30.609
I'm close to giving you
a punch in the face.

715
01:15:30.634 --> 01:15:33.192
Look, fight club, I know you're
new how things work up here.

716
01:15:33.204 --> 01:15:35.134
Why don't you look
around, we are lost.

717
01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:37.967
You see that over there.
What is that? Nada!

718
01:15:37.974 --> 01:15:39.794
This place's a wasteland.

719
01:15:40.135 --> 01:15:42.074
You're the one who call this
'wasteland' a home.

720
01:15:42.114 --> 01:15:43.804
This isn't my home.

721
01:15:44.133 --> 01:15:45.844
It's not like the whole
surface look like this.

722
01:15:46.044 --> 01:15:47.174
Oh, no. Of course not.

723
01:15:47.214 --> 01:15:50.655
You've also got disgusting cities with
sewers emptying out into our ocean

724
01:15:50.655 --> 01:15:52.772
and whole mountains
made out of trash, and...

725
01:15:52.772 --> 01:15:56.269
Oh, you've got great factories
that do nothing but melt ice.

726
01:15:56.294 --> 01:15:58.254
Okay, okay! Okay,
point taken. Listen.

727
01:15:58.294 --> 01:15:59.960
Yeah, we got some idiots
running the show.

728
01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.539
But we got some good
things too, alright?

729
01:16:01.564 --> 01:16:03.554
We got green forest
and big mountains,

730
01:16:03.564 --> 01:16:04.734
and beautiful lakes.

731
01:16:04.764 --> 01:16:06.795
You'd love them. There
are like little baby oceans.

732
01:16:06.852 --> 01:16:08.739
Are you trying to
provoke me?

733
01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:10.905
I'm just saying you cannot judge
a place before you even see it.

734
01:16:11.074 --> 01:16:13.702
You judged Atlantis on far less.

735
01:16:17.214 --> 01:16:19.732
No, no, no. Will you
just stop it with that?

736
01:16:19.914 --> 01:16:20.974
No!

737
01:16:20.984 --> 01:16:23.974
Your stupid Atlantean GPS just
told you to jump out of an airplane

738
01:16:24.002 --> 01:16:26.331
over the middle of the desert.
And now we are stranded.

739
01:16:29.654 --> 01:16:32.594
If you are the next
true king we're doomed.

740
01:17:00.154 --> 01:17:01.873
That was awesome.

741
01:17:07.194 --> 01:17:09.516
Oh! Look what
I've found.

742
01:17:10.764 --> 01:17:13.147
- What you've found?
- Yeah.

743
01:17:23.544 --> 01:17:25.637
Check this place out.

744
01:17:26.037 --> 01:17:28.584
This is badass!

745
01:17:28.784 --> 01:17:31.110
This is the hall of armoury

746
01:17:31.491 --> 01:17:34.226
where the legend says
Atlan's trident was forged.

747
01:17:36.054 --> 01:17:38.694
I don't think that is
a legend anymore.

748
01:17:44.394 --> 01:17:46.523
Vulko was right.

749
01:17:48.404 --> 01:17:50.378
It's real.

750
01:18:28.974 --> 01:18:30.766
Nothing.

751
01:18:30.914 --> 01:18:33.004
Of course it's not working.
It's been sitting here

752
01:18:33.044 --> 01:18:35.382
collecting dust since before
the Sahara was a desert.

753
01:18:37.701 --> 01:18:39.310
Man!

754
01:18:39.357 --> 01:18:42.116
<i>"Since before the
Sahara was a desert."</i>

755
01:18:42.424 --> 01:18:44.549
Thank you for repeating
what I've just said.

756
01:18:44.624 --> 01:18:47.177
It's completely dried out.

757
01:18:48.294 --> 01:18:51.284
You do your best thinking when
you're not thinking at all.

758
01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:53.839
- Right. Now, hold still.
- Hey?

759
01:18:53.934 --> 01:18:56.196
- What are you doing?
- We need water.

760
01:18:56.974 --> 01:19:00.994
You are the closest source.
Now, hold still.

761
01:19:37.195 --> 01:19:38.610
Show off, eh?

762
01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:40.935
I could've just peed on it.

763
01:19:50.924 --> 01:19:52.824
King Atlan.

764
01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:59.764
In this trident resides
the power of Atlantis.

765
01:19:59.804 --> 01:20:03.633
In the wrong hands, it
would bring destruction.

766
01:20:03.873 --> 01:20:05.770
But In the hands
of the true heir,

767
01:20:05.794 --> 01:20:09.360
it will unite all our
kingdoms above and below.

768
01:20:10.114 --> 01:20:14.733
If you seek my power,
you must prove your worth.

769
01:20:14.814 --> 01:20:18.009
Journey beyond the edge of
the world to the hidden sea.

770
01:20:18.554 --> 01:20:21.614
Look inside the bottle
for the chartered path.

771
01:20:21.624 --> 01:20:24.399
Only in the hands
of the true king

772
01:20:25.406 --> 01:20:28.416
can he truly see.

773
01:20:43.504 --> 01:20:45.604
We can't let Orm find this.

774
01:20:47.244 --> 01:20:49.218
Hey! Hey, wait! Oh!

775
01:20:50.114 --> 01:20:51.259
What?

776
01:20:51.359 --> 01:20:52.984
Shouldn't we have
written it down first?

777
01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:55.469
I memorized it,
didn't you?

778
01:20:55.694 --> 01:20:57.800
Oh.
Oh, yeah, totally.

779
01:20:59.794 --> 01:21:01.538
What did he just said?

780
01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:05.594
Something-something Trident.

781
01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:22.591
<i>"Look inside the bottle
for the chartered path"</i>

782
01:21:28.224 --> 01:21:30.954
It's our next stop.

783
01:23:04.284 --> 01:23:06.944
I'm starting to think you're
actually like these surface dwellers.

784
01:23:07.054 --> 01:23:10.077
It'd be wrong to judge a place
I had never seen before.

785
01:23:12.394 --> 01:23:14.379
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

786
01:23:33.744 --> 01:23:34.799
Well...

787
01:23:34.948 --> 01:23:37.402
apparently its right up on
the hill at the old castle.

788
01:23:37.662 --> 01:23:40.102
You know, I've just learnt
something very interesting.

789
01:23:41.154 --> 01:23:42.922
Pinocchio.

790
01:23:42.954 --> 01:23:45.984
You risk our lives based on something
you've read in a children's book?

791
01:23:47.124 --> 01:23:49.325
Wait, it's a book? Huh.

792
01:23:49.349 --> 01:23:50.860
How about that.

793
01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:52.803
No. I got it from a movie.

794
01:23:53.394 --> 01:23:54.894
<i>Andiamo!</i>

795
01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:02.519
King Nereus, I had hoped
that our people had evolved

796
01:24:02.519 --> 01:24:04.434
beyond that ancient illusion

797
01:24:04.458 --> 01:24:06.779
that war with the
surface is inevitable.

798
01:24:06.779 --> 01:24:09.083
It is the position of the Fishermen

799
01:24:09.107 --> 01:24:12.668
that when the time comes to make
ourselves known to the lands men,

800
01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:16.350
it shall be to educate them,
not to destroy them.

801
01:24:17.824 --> 01:24:21.256
I admire your lofty
aspirations, king Ricou.

802
01:24:24.664 --> 01:24:27.518
But I suspect they
are clouds of ink

803
01:24:27.542 --> 01:24:29.542
hiding the heart of a coward.

804
01:24:29.634 --> 01:24:31.335
How dare you!

805
01:24:33.404 --> 01:24:35.747
Please, I implore you.

806
01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:40.434
Your kingdom has bloated
philosophers and flaccid poets

807
01:24:40.444 --> 01:24:43.619
whose waters have gone
stagnant, and it sickens me.

808
01:24:51.994 --> 01:24:54.329
- My king!
- The king is dead.

809
01:24:55.594 --> 01:24:58.394
Long live his heir.

810
01:24:59.064 --> 01:25:00.731
Princess.

811
01:25:00.867 --> 01:25:03.467
Prepare your armies,
Your Highness.

812
01:25:04.634 --> 01:25:07.353
We move against the
Brine kingdom at once.

813
01:25:15.884 --> 01:25:17.674
What was the
recording said, again?

814
01:25:17.814 --> 01:25:20.704
<i>"Journey beyond the edge of
the world to the hidden sea.</i>

815
01:25:20.724 --> 01:25:22.714
<i>Look in the bottle for
the chartered path.</i>

816
01:25:22.754 --> 01:25:26.708
<i>Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."</i>

817
01:25:29.194 --> 01:25:32.090
<i>"Look in the bottle for
the chartered path."</i>

818
01:25:37.034 --> 01:25:38.676
Oh man.

819
01:25:39.063 --> 01:25:42.148
- What?
- Wow, Hah-ha. That's...

820
01:25:42.509 --> 01:25:44.289
Let me see.

821
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:47.546
Wow! But how do you
know where to point it?

822
01:25:47.547 --> 01:25:48.833
Let me see.

823
01:25:48.914 --> 01:25:50.604
What was the last line?

824
01:25:50.644 --> 01:25:53.683
<i>"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."</i>

825
01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:56.372
<i>"... in the hands of
the true king..."</i>

826
01:25:57.386 --> 01:25:59.370
Marcus Agrippa..

827
01:25:59.394 --> 01:26:01.614
He was a great General,
but he wasn't a king.

828
01:26:03.249 --> 01:26:05.340
And there was <i>Scipio</i>.

829
01:26:06.034 --> 01:26:08.414
- How do you know all this stuff?
- It was my pops.

830
01:26:08.414 --> 01:26:09.914
He made sure
I know my history.

831
01:26:09.934 --> 01:26:12.690
None of these guys
were kings except...

832
01:26:13.308 --> 01:26:15.467
...this guy. Romulus.

833
01:26:16.167 --> 01:26:18.777
First king of Rome.

834
01:26:20.314 --> 01:26:22.404
<i>"Only in the hands
of the true king</i>

835
01:26:22.444 --> 01:26:24.344
<i>can he truly see."</i>

836
01:26:31.756 --> 01:26:32.900
Ha-Ha!

837
01:26:33.424 --> 01:26:35.387
There it is. That's
where we're heading.

838
01:26:35.411 --> 01:26:37.393
What? Let me see.

839
01:26:39.606 --> 01:26:41.350
We did...!

840
01:26:43.904 --> 01:26:45.994
It's not bad for
an imbecile, huh?

841
01:26:48.104 --> 01:26:49.904
Not bad at all.

842
01:27:06.622 --> 01:27:12.259
<i>"Loathsomeness waits
and dreams in the deep</i>

843
01:27:12.276 --> 01:27:17.449
<i>and decay spreads over
the tottering cities of men."</i>

844
01:27:21.113 --> 01:27:22.591
Get back!

845
01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:29.741
Arthur!

846
01:27:31.978 --> 01:27:33.580
I order you to stand down!

847
01:27:33.604 --> 01:27:36.193
Princess Mera, you have been
charged with high treason.

848
01:27:56.111 --> 01:27:59.684
- Who the hell are you?
- Maybe this will jog your memory!

849
01:28:47.778 --> 01:28:49.454
You're the guy from the sub.

850
01:28:49.977 --> 01:28:51.422
- That's right!
- Ah!

851
01:28:52.146 --> 01:28:55.236
But now I have
Atlantean steel.

852
01:29:00.106 --> 01:29:02.240
Call me 'Black...

853
01:29:02.264 --> 01:29:04.336
...Manta!

854
01:29:18.736 --> 01:29:21.246
You thought you
could walk away?

855
01:29:26.718 --> 01:29:28.707
I thought I told you
not to make this a habit.

856
01:29:33.622 --> 01:29:35.484
Mi scusi!

857
01:29:49.272 --> 01:29:50.922
You can't run!

858
01:29:51.614 --> 01:29:54.937
- You owe me a blood!
- How did you find me?

859
01:29:54.937 --> 01:29:59.366
Your lady friend has people
who like to keep tabs on her.

860
01:31:16.347 --> 01:31:17.532
No!

861
01:31:51.884 --> 01:31:53.714
Go!

862
01:31:56.942 --> 01:31:59.583
Everybody! Inside!
Inside!

863
01:32:04.894 --> 01:32:08.111
I'll show you the same mercy
you showed my father

864
01:32:08.334 --> 01:32:11.017
and cut you like
the fish you are.

865
01:34:06.644 --> 01:34:08.094
Arthur!

866
01:34:11.624 --> 01:34:14.243
Mera... they are
tracking you.

867
01:34:14.526 --> 01:34:16.853
- What?
- They are tracking you.

868
01:34:28.174 --> 01:34:29.247
Arthur!

869
01:34:29.531 --> 01:34:31.250
Arthur, Stay with me.

870
01:34:31.774 --> 01:34:33.368
Arthur, wake up.

871
01:34:33.846 --> 01:34:35.197
Arthur.

872
01:35:23.964 --> 01:35:24.964
Um...

873
01:35:26.394 --> 01:35:28.224
Did you steal a boat?

874
01:35:28.234 --> 01:35:31.204
Are the boats at the marina
not for public use?

875
01:35:31.504 --> 01:35:34.419
No. Those belong to people.

876
01:35:34.684 --> 01:35:35.892
Hah?

877
01:35:37.674 --> 01:35:39.628
Those were Orm's
elite commandoes.

878
01:35:39.662 --> 01:35:41.957
The one who lead them
wasn't a Atlantean.

879
01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:44.722
I've never seen him before.

880
01:35:45.261 --> 01:35:47.000
Yeah, I have.

881
01:35:47.154 --> 01:35:49.761
He and his father were pirates.

882
01:35:51.259 --> 01:35:53.454
He blames me for
his father's death.

883
01:35:53.594 --> 01:35:55.577
He picked a dangerous
line of trade.

884
01:35:57.134 --> 01:35:58.780
It's not your fault.

885
01:35:58.794 --> 01:36:01.247
It's not how it feels.

886
01:36:02.834 --> 01:36:06.004
It was up to me, I let him die.

887
01:36:06.934 --> 01:36:09.135
I could've save
him, but I didn't.

888
01:36:09.874 --> 01:36:11.794
And now, I made an enemy.

889
01:36:12.047 --> 01:36:13.901
And he could've hurt you,

890
01:36:13.925 --> 01:36:15.925
that would've
been my fault.

891
01:36:17.114 --> 01:36:19.418
Well, he's behind us now.

892
01:36:20.484 --> 01:36:23.034
It's what lies ahead
that should concerns us.

893
01:36:24.884 --> 01:36:28.160
The chartered path leads to
the kingdom of the trench.

894
01:36:29.654 --> 01:36:32.624
Is that the same creatures
that killed my mother?

895
01:36:32.664 --> 01:36:36.264
Yes. She was taken there
and sacrificed to them.

896
01:36:36.264 --> 01:36:37.999
It has become
a place of death.

897
01:36:38.304 --> 01:36:41.119
And I know next to nothing
about what's down there.

898
01:36:44.804 --> 01:36:46.585
We should turn back.

899
01:36:46.944 --> 01:36:49.689
We can still warn the surface, try to
prepare them for what's coming.

900
01:36:49.774 --> 01:36:51.348
Turn back?

901
01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:55.089
Look. I learned from a young
age not to show weakness.

902
01:36:55.384 --> 01:36:58.354
Okay? it's not my problem's
with my anger and my fist.

903
01:36:58.912 --> 01:37:01.021
I'm a blunt instrument
and I'm damn good at it.

904
01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:03.669
I've done nothing

905
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:05.584
but get my ass kicked
this whole trip.

906
01:37:06.194 --> 01:37:09.096
I'm no leader.
I'm not a king.

907
01:37:09.151 --> 01:37:12.067
I do not work or
play well with others.

908
01:37:13.204 --> 01:37:16.157
And I can't let you die trying to
turn me into something that I'm not.

909
01:37:17.704 --> 01:37:19.534
You think you're
unworthy to lead because

910
01:37:19.558 --> 01:37:21.558
you have two
different worlds.

911
01:37:22.374 --> 01:37:25.011
But that is exactly
why you are worthy.

912
01:37:25.344 --> 01:37:28.477
You are the bridge
between land and sea.

913
01:37:29.254 --> 01:37:31.389
I can see that now.

914
01:37:31.954 --> 01:37:34.256
The only question is...

915
01:37:35.995 --> 01:37:37.967
...can you?

916
01:37:52.874 --> 01:37:56.442
The tracking on lady Mera is still
dark, Your highness.

917
01:37:57.214 --> 01:37:59.632
Vulko...

918
01:37:59.781 --> 01:38:01.489
my trusted vizier.

919
01:38:01.554 --> 01:38:05.314
You stood by the throne
since my father sat upon it.

920
01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:10.424
You have any advise for
me before this war begins?

921
01:38:10.424 --> 01:38:13.137
I've already given it, my king,

922
01:38:13.524 --> 01:38:16.724
that I will stand by
your decision as always.

923
01:38:17.522 --> 01:38:19.454
My decision?

924
01:38:21.254 --> 01:38:23.704
To protect it…

925
01:38:24.859 --> 01:38:27.018
...while you betray it.

926
01:38:27.374 --> 01:38:31.114
You think I do not
know of your treachery?

927
01:38:31.144 --> 01:38:36.126
That you have been loyal to
my mother's bastard son?

928
01:38:36.454 --> 01:38:41.702
That you have spent years training
him to take the throne from me?

929
01:38:44.694 --> 01:38:46.824
Do not deny it.

930
01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:52.068
- I do not.
- Why?

931
01:38:53.834 --> 01:38:56.104
I am the pure blood.

932
01:38:56.986 --> 01:38:59.599
I have devoted my
life to Atlantis.

933
01:39:00.104 --> 01:39:01.847
He wanted nothing
to do with it.

934
01:39:01.847 --> 01:39:04.316
- You swore to serve the throne.
- I do serve it.

935
01:39:04.344 --> 01:39:06.600
Arthur may only be
half Atlantean,

936
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.919
but he is already twice
the king you'll ever be.

937
01:39:17.241 --> 01:39:18.828
Take him.

938
01:39:19.994 --> 01:39:22.214
But make sure
he has a view.

939
01:41:03.344 --> 01:41:05.043
What the hell are these things?

940
01:41:05.067 --> 01:41:06.631
The Trench!
We're here!

941
01:41:09.044 --> 01:41:11.327
- There're too many of them!
- Come on! inside!

942
01:41:21.424 --> 01:41:23.539
They re from the depths.
They're scared to the light.

943
01:41:23.563 --> 01:41:24.882
Here!

944
01:41:36.904 --> 01:41:38.283
Come on!

945
01:41:42.624 --> 01:41:44.461
Get ready to jump!

946
01:42:53.024 --> 01:42:54.924
Over there!

947
01:43:29.264 --> 01:43:31.324
That thing will tear us apart.

948
01:43:31.548 --> 01:43:32.897
We don't have a choice.

949
01:43:53.784 --> 01:43:55.454
Arthur!

950
01:43:58.124 --> 01:43:59.224
Mera!

951
01:44:30.524 --> 01:44:31.991
Mera!

952
01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:33.993
Mera!

953
01:44:55.754 --> 01:44:56.984
Mera!

954
01:44:59.519 --> 01:45:01.128
Mera!

955
01:45:44.764 --> 01:45:46.344
Arthur.

956
01:45:46.728 --> 01:45:48.643
Mom?

957
01:46:26.574 --> 01:46:29.402
King Orvax sacrificed
me to the trench.

958
01:46:29.674 --> 01:46:33.072
But I survived, fought my
way through as you did,

959
01:46:33.072 --> 01:46:34.538
and I ended up here.

960
01:46:34.562 --> 01:46:36.562
You've been here alone
for twenty years?

961
01:46:36.684 --> 01:46:38.153
- Yes.
- Ah!

962
01:46:38.153 --> 01:46:39.899
Come, sit here.

963
01:46:44.664 --> 01:46:46.508
You must forgive me.

964
01:46:46.781 --> 01:46:49.411
Forgive me for everything.

965
01:46:49.834 --> 01:46:52.349
This happened
because you had me.

966
01:46:52.434 --> 01:46:54.253
Not for having you.

967
01:46:54.434 --> 01:46:57.035
None of this is your fault.

968
01:46:57.204 --> 01:47:01.589
I made a choice.
I had to leave to save you.

969
01:47:02.144 --> 01:47:04.414
To save your father.

970
01:47:06.544 --> 01:47:08.834
Tell me. tell me about him.

971
01:47:09.518 --> 01:47:11.257
Is he….

972
01:47:14.724 --> 01:47:17.654
He still walks to
the end of that dock?

973
01:47:18.894 --> 01:47:20.888
Every morning.

974
01:47:22.894 --> 01:47:24.764
…Every day.

975
01:47:27.304 --> 01:47:29.953
Waiting for you.

976
01:47:36.644 --> 01:47:38.634
Why didn't you
ever come back?

977
01:47:43.994 --> 01:47:46.991
Because the portal that brought
you here won't let us return.

978
01:47:48.254 --> 01:47:50.865
The trident is
the only way back.

979
01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:54.395
But it is guarded

980
01:47:54.419 --> 01:47:56.419
by the Karathen.

981
01:47:57.364 --> 01:48:00.345
The creature from
our legend is real.

982
01:48:00.534 --> 01:48:03.594
It lies beyond the waterfall.

983
01:48:07.614 --> 01:48:09.934
We'll go with you.
We can fight it together.

984
01:48:09.958 --> 01:48:12.987
No.
It's too powerful.

985
01:48:13.344 --> 01:48:16.323
I've tried many
times over the years.

986
01:48:17.224 --> 01:48:20.774
The creature will only allow
the true king to pass.

987
01:48:23.454 --> 01:48:25.514
You're afraid.

988
01:48:27.694 --> 01:48:29.368
Yes.

989
01:48:30.388 --> 01:48:32.408
Good.

990
01:48:33.334 --> 01:48:35.256
You're ready.

991
01:48:36.204 --> 01:48:39.174
Atlantis was always had a king.

992
01:48:39.657 --> 01:48:41.535
Now it needs
something more.

993
01:48:42.074 --> 01:48:44.134
Well, what could be
greater than a king?

994
01:48:44.414 --> 01:48:46.287
A hero.

995
01:48:47.314 --> 01:48:49.284
A king fights only
for his nation.

996
01:48:49.284 --> 01:48:50.760
You...

997
01:48:51.777 --> 01:48:54.173
...fight for everyone.

998
01:50:22.574 --> 01:50:27.344
You do not belong here.

999
01:50:28.384 --> 01:50:33.380
I have guarded the trident
against false kings

1000
01:50:33.404 --> 01:50:37.969
since the beginning and
for a thousand years.

1001
01:50:37.994 --> 01:50:41.664
I have seen greatest
champions try...

1002
01:50:41.664 --> 01:50:43.436
...and fail,

1003
01:50:43.534 --> 01:50:49.087
but never have I sensed
one as unworthy as you.

1004
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:52.672
You dare come here

1005
01:50:52.696 --> 01:50:56.088
with your tainted
mongrel blood

1006
01:50:56.144 --> 01:51:00.634
to claim Atlantis's
greatest treasure?

1007
01:51:02.884 --> 01:51:04.874
So be it.

1008
01:51:05.054 --> 01:51:07.084
Half breed!

1009
01:51:26.444 --> 01:51:29.433
You thought yourself worthy?

1010
01:51:29.674 --> 01:51:32.644
You thought yourself a king?

1011
01:51:32.684 --> 01:51:37.178
You dishonour this place
with your presence.

1012
01:51:37.179 --> 01:51:39.022
Stop!

1013
01:51:45.664 --> 01:51:47.514
You're right.

1014
01:51:47.538 --> 01:51:49.681
I am a half breed
mongrel.

1015
01:51:50.859 --> 01:51:53.353
But I did not come here because I
thought I was worthy.

1016
01:51:53.469 --> 01:51:55.069
I know I'm not.

1017
01:51:55.769 --> 01:51:59.659
You understand me?

1018
01:51:59.683 --> 01:52:01.526
I do.

1019
01:52:01.544 --> 01:52:07.884
No mortal has conversed
with me since king Atlan.

1020
01:52:09.214 --> 01:52:12.359
Who are you?

1021
01:52:13.184 --> 01:52:15.154
I'm nobody.

1022
01:52:16.954 --> 01:52:20.453
I came because
I had no choice.

1023
01:52:21.224 --> 01:52:23.163
I came to save my home,

1024
01:52:23.163 --> 01:52:26.334
and the people that I love.

1025
01:52:28.264 --> 01:52:32.057
I came because the trident
is our only hope.

1026
01:52:32.452 --> 01:52:35.104
And if that's not
good enough...

1027
01:52:36.796 --> 01:52:39.074
...then screw you.

1028
01:52:40.614 --> 01:52:43.806
No man has ever freed

1029
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:47.368
the trident from
Atlan's grip.

1030
01:52:48.141 --> 01:52:51.323
Should he deemed
you unworthy...

1031
01:52:51.564 --> 01:52:56.484
well, I haven't
fiested in years..

1032
01:52:56.508 --> 01:53:00.268
And I am damaged.

1033
01:54:29.224 --> 01:54:32.598
The one true king.

1034
01:54:45.244 --> 01:54:48.410
Remember, the Brine are
a powerful savage group

1035
01:54:48.959 --> 01:54:52.478
...its tend to change the sides indirectly
after their leadership turn the tide.

1036
01:54:52.801 --> 01:54:54.514
Defeat the Brine king

1037
01:54:54.538 --> 01:54:58.177
and you will command the greatest
military might on this planet.

1038
01:55:00.424 --> 01:55:02.484
Today we unite our kingdoms.

1039
01:55:03.494 --> 01:55:06.245
Tomorrow we scorch the surface!

1040
01:55:06.564 --> 01:55:12.749
Rise, Atlantians!

1041
01:55:27.917 --> 01:55:30.230
Death to atlantean!

1042
01:55:30.254 --> 01:55:32.537
Take this!

1043
01:55:36.509 --> 01:55:39.081
We do not fail to atlantis!

1044
01:55:39.105 --> 01:55:43.217
We're going to give them a fight
that they will never forget!

1045
01:56:50.694 --> 01:56:52.435
No, we need him!

1046
01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:56.524
Join me or die!

1047
01:56:56.849 --> 01:56:59.925
You expect me to address
you as Your Highness?

1048
01:57:00.074 --> 01:57:01.974
Not Your Highness.

1049
01:57:03.233 --> 01:57:05.372
Call me...

1050
01:57:05.565 --> 01:57:07.548
..."Ocean master".

1051
01:57:07.651 --> 01:57:11.234
You can take my army,
you soft bellied slut!

1052
01:57:11.343 --> 01:57:14.914
But you will never
have my allegiance!

1053
01:57:15.054 --> 01:57:16.602
So be it!

1054
01:57:48.102 --> 01:57:50.022
What the...?

1055
01:58:24.603 --> 01:58:26.735
The King has risen.

1056
01:58:33.972 --> 01:58:36.883
Attack!

1057
02:00:35.154 --> 02:00:37.954
There're too many casualties.
We have to stop the fighting now.

1058
02:00:37.994 --> 02:00:41.325
I'll find my father.
You must defeat Orm.

1059
02:00:42.502 --> 02:00:44.137
And what if I can't?

1060
02:00:44.161 --> 02:00:46.962
Last time he was
in his element.

1061
02:00:47.004 --> 02:00:50.694
This time, make him
fight in yours.

1062
02:01:17.509 --> 02:01:19.006
Um...

1063
02:01:19.434 --> 02:01:22.618
- What's the plan again?
- Plan is to not gonna get killed.

1064
02:01:23.591 --> 02:01:26.983
Yeah. Good plan.
Don't get killed.

1065
02:01:59.404 --> 02:02:01.486
The trench!
He commands the trench!

1066
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:03.624
Impossible!

1067
02:02:19.364 --> 02:02:21.299
Stand down!
Let her pass.

1068
02:02:21.494 --> 02:02:24.442
Please, father,
he has the trident.

1069
02:02:24.964 --> 02:02:27.094
I know you think
this war is necessary.

1070
02:02:27.134 --> 02:02:29.547
But Arthur is king by
our most sacred law.

1071
02:02:29.574 --> 02:02:31.038
And if you turn your
back on that now

1072
02:02:31.104 --> 02:02:33.326
then the Atlantis you're
fighting for is already dead.

1073
02:02:33.889 --> 02:02:36.759
It's true. The half breed
wields king Atlan's trident.

1074
02:02:36.783 --> 02:02:38.497
He commands the sea.

1075
02:02:40.093 --> 02:02:42.607
Then that half
breed is your king.

1076
02:03:59.154 --> 02:04:01.743
Vulko! Come on,
he needs our help.

1077
02:04:01.743 --> 02:04:03.689
We can't. Look.

1078
02:04:03.689 --> 02:04:05.841
The people must bear witness.

1079
02:04:11.374 --> 02:04:14.199
That trident doesn't
change what you are.

1080
02:04:14.874 --> 02:04:16.763
Half breed bastard.

1081
02:04:18.614 --> 02:04:22.668
Atlantis will never
accept you as its King.

1082
02:04:25.214 --> 02:04:27.474
Well then, by bloodshed

1083
02:04:28.408 --> 02:04:30.993
till the gods make
known their will!

1084
02:04:59.972 --> 02:05:03.440
Yield the throne.

1085
02:06:38.084 --> 02:06:40.512
- Finish it.
- Yield the throne.

1086
02:06:40.824 --> 02:06:42.884
Mercy is not our way.

1087
02:06:44.124 --> 02:06:46.636
Maybe you haven't
noticed, brother,

1088
02:06:51.334 --> 02:06:54.324
- but I'm not one of you.
- Do it!

1089
02:06:57.174 --> 02:06:58.892
- Kill me!
- No!

1090
02:07:01.604 --> 02:07:03.664
That is enough killing!

1091
02:07:10.854 --> 02:07:12.538
Mother?

1092
02:07:12.554 --> 02:07:14.586
Orm, my son.

1093
02:07:23.394 --> 02:07:25.139
It's a long story.

1094
02:07:25.748 --> 02:07:27.694
I'll tell you later.

1095
02:07:28.194 --> 02:07:29.807
Come on.

1096
02:07:35.874 --> 02:07:38.812
I don't understand.
We thought you…

1097
02:07:38.813 --> 02:07:40.555
I know.

1098
02:07:40.817 --> 02:07:43.111
Arthur saved me.

1099
02:07:46.524 --> 02:07:48.978
- You're with him?
- I am.

1100
02:07:51.194 --> 02:07:54.986
You're both my children,
and I love you so much.

1101
02:07:56.394 --> 02:07:58.682
But you have been misguided.

1102
02:08:00.234 --> 02:08:02.679
Your father taught you

1103
02:08:02.703 --> 02:08:05.433
that there were two worlds.
He was wrong.

1104
02:08:05.833 --> 02:08:09.510
The land and the sea...

1105
02:08:09.801 --> 02:08:11.898
...are one.

1106
02:08:31.534 --> 02:08:33.158
My Queen.

1107
02:08:35.464 --> 02:08:37.317
Vulko.

1108
02:08:39.204 --> 02:08:40.863
Take him.

1109
02:08:40.924 --> 02:08:43.822
But make sure
he has a view.

1110
02:08:50.784 --> 02:08:52.598
When you're ready…

1111
02:08:53.687 --> 02:08:55.735
...let's talk.

1112
02:09:09.974 --> 02:09:13.957
People of Atlantis, today
began with bloodshed.

1113
02:09:13.981 --> 02:09:16.979
Let it end in joy.

1114
02:09:17.004 --> 02:09:18.942
I give you...

1115
02:09:18.966 --> 02:09:21.347
...King Arthur of Atlantis.

1116
02:09:21.414 --> 02:09:23.321
Hail to the king!

1117
02:09:23.732 --> 02:09:26.070
Hail to the king!

1118
02:09:34.124 --> 02:09:36.575
So, what do I do now?

1119
02:09:37.128 --> 02:09:39.386
Be their king.

1120
02:09:41.479 --> 02:09:44.005
This is going to be fun.

1121
02:10:35.594 --> 02:10:38.459
You came back!
You're back.

1122
02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:41.016
Yes. Yes.

1123
02:10:46.564 --> 02:10:49.382
My father was
a lighthouse keeper.

1124
02:10:50.104 --> 02:10:52.778
My mother was a queen.

1125
02:10:53.374 --> 02:10:55.646
They were never
meant to meet.

1126
02:10:59.344 --> 02:11:01.934
But their love saved the world.

1127
02:11:03.684 --> 02:11:05.654
They made me what I am.

1128
02:11:06.184 --> 02:11:10.663
A son of the land,
a king of the seas.

1129
02:11:11.624 --> 02:11:15.155
I am the protector of the deep.

1130
02:11:15.624 --> 02:11:17.096
I am...

1131
02:11:18.158 --> 02:11:20.613
...Aquaman.

1132
02:13:59.932 --> 02:14:06.599
AQUAMAN

1133
02:14:29.681 --> 02:14:30.681
Hey!

1134
02:14:34.370 --> 02:14:35.946
I've spent 15 years..

1135
02:14:35.970 --> 02:14:38.565
...at the united states
institute of marine science studying...

1136
02:14:38.565 --> 02:14:41.800
- Weren't you fired?
- studying oceanic phenomenon,

1137
02:14:41.824 --> 02:14:44.250
and this is the most conclusive
evidence we have today.

1138
02:14:44.274 --> 02:14:47.578
Deep sea seismographs have recorded
explotions on the ocean floor.

1139
02:14:47.602 --> 02:14:49.125
We have sattelite imagery...

1140
02:14:49.149 --> 02:14:52.051
a debrie from atlantean warship
floating on the surface.

1141
02:14:52.075 --> 02:14:53.833
- Doctor. Shin!
- Would you, please, let me finish?

1142
02:14:53.857 --> 02:14:56.079
Here we go again.

1143
02:14:56.103 --> 02:14:59.025
Yes, the government dosen't
want us to know about the threat

1144
02:14:59.049 --> 02:15:00.265
that excists right here
on our world...

1145
02:15:00.289 --> 02:15:02.202
Yeah, I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

1146
02:15:14.591 --> 02:15:16.822
This is atlantean
technology, isn't it?

1147
02:15:16.846 --> 02:15:19.005
Could you tell me
how you've got this?

1148
02:15:19.029 --> 02:15:20.640
Sure.

1149
02:15:20.664 --> 02:15:22.224
But first..

1150
02:15:22.348 --> 02:15:25.324
...you've got to tell me
how to find him.

1151
02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:27.647
[ Who is Aquaman? ]
