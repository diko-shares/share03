00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.400
<i>On my late father's advice...</i>

2
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.700
<i>I first became a thief.</i>

3
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.200
<i>but then I discovered thieving
gets your hands cut off.</i>

4
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.600
<i>or your feet smashed
with a hammer.</i>

5
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.500
<i>or hanged...
like my father.</i>

6
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.800
<i>So I gave up being a thief
and did the next best thing.</i>

7
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.300
<i>I joined the church.</i>

8
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.600
<i>Not a priest,
though it has good prospects.</i>

9
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.900
<i>No.</i>

10
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.900
<i> As a painter,
an artist.</i>

11
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.500
<i>I could do it all.
Angels, devils, virgins and nuns.</i>

12
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.800
<i>Painting bums on angels is not
a bad way of earning a living.</i>

13
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.500
<i>And I was happy.</i>

14
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.600
<i>Then everything changed.</i>

15
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.800
<i>Not just for me....
for everyone.</i>

16
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.100
<i>The rich, the poor,
everyone...</i>

17
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.100
<i>This boy, Lorenzo, he's always in trouble,
always pushing his luck.</i>

18
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.600
<i>Lorenzo's a gambler, a winner,
but his luck is running out.</i>

19
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.400
<i>This time he's won
against the wrong person.</i>

20
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.900
Gerbino De la Ratta.

21
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.600
<i>They had this fight, you see.
And Gerbino's a bad loser.</i>

22
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.300
<i>A really bad loser.</i>

23
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.800
<i>Gerbino De la Ratta would resent
losing a dirty sock in a wager.</i>

24
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.500
<i>That's the kind
of person he is.</i>

25
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.500
-Come down here and fight.
-So you can put a scar like that on my cheek?

26
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.200
I'd improve your looks, you ugly shit,
but I'm far too beautiful.

27
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.700
You're next.

28
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.100
Into the shit,
where you belong.

29
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.700
Why is he still alive,
Andreuccio?

30
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.400
I told you,
I want him dead.

31
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.300
<i>Lorenzo De Lamberti was not the
first to have a thing for Pampinea Anastasi.</i>

32
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.100
<i>Although he was the
last one to admit.</i>

33
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.400
<i>The richest girl in town,
Pampinea is not so much spoiled...</i>

34
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.400
<i>as laviously as
overindulged.</i>

35
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.800
<i>Poor little rich girl.</i>

36
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.000
<i>But that was before the plague.
Not now.</i>

37
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.900
<i>Everything's changed.</i>

38
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.900
<i>Even for Pampinea.</i>

39
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.200
Lorenzo, quick!

40
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.300
Gerbino's waiting for
you at your house.

41
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.700
He won't rest until
you're dead.

42
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.600
Get the hell out.
Now!

43
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.300
<i>Having painted the bums on 14 angels,
I was still waiting to be paid.</i>

44
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.500
-Did you tell him?
-He's still asleep.

45
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.900
You wait there.

46
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.400
There.

47
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.200
The Plague.
Just my luck.

48
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.700
Looks like we're
not getting paid.

49
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.300
Go home.
You're done here.

50
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.100
<i>Then I heard voices.</i>

51
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.800
<i>Come and join us.
Priests, right!</i>

52
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.300
<i>They got it all!</i>

53
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.400
Food, money.

54
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.800
<i>And of course,
the key to the convent.</i>

55
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.800
<i>All those beautiful nuns.</i>

56
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.800
<i>Rumor has it Gerbino De la Ratta
is a bit short on his equipment.</i>

57
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.800
<i>You know, not much going on
downstairs in the trouser department.</i>

58
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.000
<i>It's funny, cause I always thought
he was the biggest dick in town.</i>

59
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.900
Pampinea.

60
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.800
I offer my sympathy.

61
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.800
-Thank you.
-It's a tragedy.

62
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.000
This plague...

63
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.100
terrible

64
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.800
terrible...

65
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.300
tragedy.

66
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.600
What would you do now,
Pampinea?

67
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.500
I promised to marry
Count Dzerzhinsky.

68
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.100
He's on his way here
from Russia to marry me.

69
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.900
Thank you for
your assistance.

70
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.700
Pampinea.

71
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.900
Before he died, your father
asked me to protect you.

72
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.300
-From what?
-His estate.

73
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.700
He was in debt.
Massive in debt, with his businesses failing.

74
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.900
To whom?
To whom was he in debt?

75
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.600
Business people.
Merchants. But I paid them off.

76
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.500
You?

77
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.900
It's what's known
as a secured loan.

78
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.600
Your father borrowed money
from me, to pay his debt...

79
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.300
against the security of this house
and all his other assets.

80
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.000
All this. None of this
belongs to him anymore.

81
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
-Who does it belong to then?
-Me.

82
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.700
Unless you pay me
the money he owed.

83
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.100
You don't have to worry about that
Pampinea, I'm here for you.

84
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.100
Your father and I discussed this
before he died, and he agreed.

85
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.300
-Agreed to what?
-That you should marry me.

86
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.300
I'm promised to marry
Count Dzerzhinsky!

87
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.300
This is a badly arranged marriage.
Your father told me before he died...

88
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.800
he much prefered me.

89
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.100
Pampinea, I'm
devoted to you.

90
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.300
Marry me.

91
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.500
I'm yours to command.

92
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.100
May I kiss your hand?

93
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:33.100
That's always been a problem isn't it.
You know. Theocracy.

94
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
She should've done something about
about that, it doesn't cost anything, does it?

95
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.600
Hey you!
Where does this road lead?

96
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.800
-Bet your wondering what I'm doing?
-No, not really. No.

97
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.100
-My friend.
-What's the matter with him? Is he drunk?

98
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.800
-No.... Guess.
-What, is he dead?

99
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.900
Right!
Good guess!

100
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.000
"I'm dead, checked out..."

101
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.300
-Please tell me, where does this road lead to?
-I'm gonna tell you the answer...

102
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.800
to this one, because you'll never
guess and we'll be standing here all day.

103
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.000
-That's what I was thinking.
-This road leads to...

104
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.300
Wait for it... the Sacred Sisters
of the Bleedin' Heart.

105
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.200
The convent.
What was he doing in a convent?

106
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.800
What was he doing in a convent?
We'll give you a clue.

107
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.600
-He was working there as a...
- A gardener?

108
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.400
Right again!
Very clever.

109
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.200
-Do they need a new gardener?
-Do you have special skills.

110
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.800
That's not a trick question,
he has special skills.

111
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.100
-Like what, dying?
-No. Guess. Come on, Guess!

112
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.600
-I don't know. How the hell should I know?
-Don't get dirty.

113
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.800
-What then, what?!
-Ow, together!

114
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.800
-Come on, tell me!
-He was deaf and dumb.

115
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.600
Deaf, therefore dumb.
I told you, he had special skills.

116
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.600
Being deaf and dumb is not a skill.
It's a handicap.

117
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.700
For him it weren't.
Bye!

118
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.000
Hello there!
I bet you're wondering what I'm...

119
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.800
Straight from heaven.

120
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.100
He's beautiful.

121
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.100
Strong.

122
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.500
Look at him,
he's....

123
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.900
beautiful.

124
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.700
-Is he hurt?
-I don't know.

125
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.500
Do you think we should take off his clothes
to see if he's broken any bones?

126
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.000
I think we should...

127
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.900
just to be sure.

128
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.700
Where should we start?

129
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.600
Your turn.

130
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.600
His mouth.
Kiss his mouth.

131
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.300
Sisters?

132
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.900
Mother,
he's alive.

133
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.500
He's said nothing, Mother.
We believe he's deaf and dumb.

134
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.000
Can you hear?

135
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.100
Can you....
speak?

136
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.200
A miracle.

137
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.900
An angel.
He fell from heaven.

138
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.300
Take him to
the bath rooms.

139
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.400
Clean him.

140
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.800
<i>For the first
time in her life...</i>

141
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.500
<i>Pampinea Anastasi feels
the need for friends.</i>

142
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.600
Filomena!

143
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.800
Did you tell the others?

144
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.600
We'll meet them
in the church.

145
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.300
Alright you lot.
Girls in front, boys step back.

146
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.100
Quino, I didn't expect to see
you here, I must say.

147
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.200
You can say, but you're
not allow to talk.

148
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.600
No problem, I'm sure you have
enough to say for everyone, for me.

149
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.200
-This is the girl you wanted to marry?
-Can't wait.

150
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.500
I could eat her alive.

151
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.400
My father has a house in the country.
A villa.

152
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.800
We could all go there
to escape the plague.

153
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.300
Good...
let's go.

154
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.600
My parent's dying wish was that I
was to marry Count Dzerzhinsky.

155
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
The marriage will take
place at the villa.

156
00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.300
You'll all be guests.

157
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.900
Pampinea.
This is an arranged marriage, yes?

158
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.300
Maybe you should try it first.
At least take a look.

159
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.400
Melissa!

160
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.900
That is an insult to Pampinea's
pledge to chastity.

161
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.800
-We're all virgins here.
-Yes, but some are more virgin than others.

162
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.100
Speak for yourself.

163
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.300
I would rather die than relinquish
my virginity before marriage.

164
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.100
I always thought you had
a thing for Lorenzo.

165
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.700
What's this?

166
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.800
What are you doing here,
all of you?

167
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.000
Praying.

168
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.700
We're praying for the dead.

169
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.300
Any one of you thinking of leaving the
city could prove extremely dangerous.

170
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.100
Go home.
All of you, like good children.

171
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.200
I recognize these two.
They're friends of Di Lamberti's.

172
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.000
Perhaps we should
take a walk.

173
00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.500
<i>I knew I should have
kept my mouth shut.</i>

174
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.500
<i>What do I care?</i>

175
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.400
<i>Even if he was
going to kill them.</i>

176
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.200
<i>Then I heard those
damn noises again.</i>

177
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:16.700
<i>Keep your mouth shut! Keep your mouth shut!
Keep your mouth shut...</i>

178
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.900
<i>Keep your mouth shut!</i>

179
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.500
<i>Oh, what the hell!
I always did have a big trap.</i>

180
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.500
You! All of you, leave.

181
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.700
Take your swords and
leave the church!

182
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.800
This is Gerbino De la Ratta.

183
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.400
No one speaks
to him like that.

184
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.700
This is the house of God,
and I speak with his voice.

185
00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.000
Who are you?

186
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.800
I'm the servant of God.
I speak with his voice.

187
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.000
You wear the cross of our Lord.
When did you last take confession?

188
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.400
The plague that walks our
streets, steals our soul.

189
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.600
It's the Armageddon.

190
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.000
See your face again,

191
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.300
I'll take your blood and
send it to your maker.

192
00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.200
Gerbino!

193
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.500
Is he dead?
Lorenzo Di Lamberti?

194
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.900
If I were you,
I'd consider him dead

195
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.400
<i>I've never talked such
bollocks in all my life.</i>

196
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.800
<i>Thank God for
being a priest..</i>

197
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.600
Is this it?

198
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.700
I thought you said you
could get a carriage.

199
00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.700
This is Uncle Bruno.

200
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.600
He's not very bright
but he's very strong.

201
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.300
Isn't that right
Uncle Bruno?

202
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.900
And he's a virgin.
Aren't you, Uncle Bruno?

203
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.700
I am.
I'm saving myself.

204
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:18.200
-Who's that?
-It's the priest, Father Tindaro.

205
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.800
If this to be a wedding,
you'll need a priest.

206
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.100
<i>After hanging around in the square for
a couple of hours waiting for Pampinea,</i>

207
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.200
<i>we discovered she'd gone to a convent</i>

208
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.600
to escape from Gerbino and
wait for her Russian Count.

209
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:39.300
<i>What better place to preserve her virginity
than amongst other virgins?</i>

210
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.900
<i>Or so she thought.</i>

211
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.800
-Who's that man?
-Oh, he's our gardener.

212
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.900
Sent from heaven.

213
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.600
-He's dead and dumb.
-What?

214
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.200
He can't hear or
speak a word.

215
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.400
How sad. He looks as if he'd have
a lot to say for himself.

216
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.200
Hear no evil,
speak no evil.

217
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.900
Hey!
Come here!

218
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.600
<i>Now jealousy is
a funny thing.</i>

219
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.800
<i>It creeps up on you,
takes you by surprise.</i>

220
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.600
<i>Distracted, Pampinea's Russian
Count has slipped from her mind.</i>

221
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.700
What is that?

222
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.700
I am here,
hello.

223
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.600
I bring gifts for you, your wife...
and your daughter...

224
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.100
soon to be my wife.

225
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.400
You're Pampinea's father,
yes?

226
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.800
I am Pampinea's father,
no

227
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.100
No?

228
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.000
I'm Gerbino De la Ratta,
Pampinea's husband to be.

229
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.600
Sir, there has been a mistake.

230
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.200
Pampinea Anastasi is supposed
to be married to me.

231
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.700
Count. You don't mind
me calling you a Count, do you?

232
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.100
What do you mean? I don't understand.
What exactly happened between us?

233
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.100
You look like a big
Count to me...

234
00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.000
Pampinea Anastasi's
soon to be my wife.

235
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.500
You just didn't hear about it...
That... is the mistake.

236
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:15.400
So you bring me all the way from Novgorod
to tell me that Pampinea Anastasi...

237
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:20.400
is marrying a man who is
old enough to be her father, yes?

238
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.500
I did not bring you here,
but I suggest you leave.

239
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.500
Florence is very bad for the
health this time of year.

240
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.700
Gerbino De la Ratta.

241
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.300
De la Rat...Huh?

242
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.300
A rat is a small furry animal,
yes?

243
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.800
Yes.

244
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.500
Yes, I thought as much.

245
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.100
Sir!

246
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.200
Sir, I'm Linguino, servant to  Pampinea
Anastasi. She's safe and well.

247
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.300
And no matter what you hear,
is waiting for your arrival...

248
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.900
This letter will give you instructions on
how to get to her villa in the country.

249
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.600
She'll meet you there
for the wedding.

250
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.600
Sir, you are in danger here.
You ride straight to the villa,

251
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.200
be there as soon
as you can.

252
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.000
For Pampinea,
I will do this.

253
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.500
We know you cannot hear
or speak to us,

254
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.100
but to us, you are beautiful like an angel
sent from heaven to bring us joy.

255
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:27.500
And we pray that God might restore the
miracle of speech to you and your hearing,

256
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.800
so that you can hear
the birds sing and...

257
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.600
-Get on with it!
-I am!

258
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.100
-He has no idea what you're saying.
-Then you do it!

259
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.400
We know that this morning you met
Sister Catherina in the orchards

260
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.100
and then Sister
Melissabeta in the granary.

261
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.800
We want what
you gave them.

262
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.900
And we want it now.

263
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.500
Come on.

264
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.800
<i>There to Florence, there
I was, stuck on that cart,</i>

265
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.800
<i>listening to Uncle Bruno farting
more than the horse,</i>

266
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.400
<i>and Miss Randy Pants ranting
on about being a virgin.</i>

267
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.800
<i>Truth is, those that rattle on
about it, can't wait to do it.</i>

268
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.400
<i>God, there she
goes again.</i>

269
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.900
I'm very proud of my virginity,
Melissa. And so is Dioneo.

270
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.500
<i>The boyfriend, Dioneo.</i>

271
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.800
<i>He's suffering from terminal
randiness as well.</i>

272
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.500
<i>Never done it in his life.</i>

273
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.500
Dioneo!

274
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.100
We don't indulge in sex
do we?

275
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.600
Not in broad daylight, in the middle
of the road, we don't, no.

276
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.500
I say, we believe in no
sex before marriage.

277
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.500
We're happy to wait,
aren't we?

278
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.200
Forever my love.

279
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.000
<i>Liar.</i>

280
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.100
Who's that?

281
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.600
Are they waving at us?

282
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.500
No, I think they're
waving at me.

283
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.900
See what they want,
quick before they leave!

284
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.000
Me?

285
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.200
Run, before they
run into Filomena!

286
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.700
No, no.
You go. You go.

287
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.100
Do we want any
milk or bread?

288
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.000
They said their produce
is very fresh...

289
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.400
and we might want to sample it,
back at their farm.

290
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.300
It's too late.

291
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.800
We can get to them.
Come on.

292
00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.700
Come on!

293
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.300
Help yourself.

294
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.700
Fresh milk,
there it is.

295
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.900
How do you get
milk out of that?

296
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.400
City boys.

297
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.700
Where we come from,
milk comes out of the jug.

298
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.900
I bet you could do it
if you tried.

299
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.800
Show us.

300
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.700
This is how it's done.

301
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.200
See how it fits nicely
into my hand?

302
00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.300
I love this thing in my hand.
Don't you, Mira?

303
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.500
Wonderful.

304
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.300
You'd almost say a little
firmer would be better.

305
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.200
Too late,
can't stop now.

306
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.700
Take it firmly in your
hand and squeeze.

307
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.800
Stroke up.

308
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.900
And pull.

309
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.300
I love this.

310
00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.800
It's coming.
I can feel it.

311
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.900
A little strong?
A little faster?

312
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.000
It's coming!

313
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.900
Milky white, hot.

314
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.100
Please! Yesona,
let's do it!

315
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.400
Dioneo. Just what do
you think you're doing with that cow?

316
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.200
"Yesona, let's do it!"

317
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.500
Disgusting.
Disgusting.

318
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.600
-I told you, we was there for the milk.
-There's the maid.

319
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.400
Those should not touch!
Remember?

320
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.300
That include beasts and barns,
especially ones with tits and hairy armpits.

321
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.200
Piss off, it's over! You'll never have
sex with me as long as you live!

322
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:31.100
<i>Sometime later, I heard that the
cow was emotionally disturbed...</i>

323
00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.800
<i>by these events, and
never gave milk again.</i>

324
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.800
<i>Poor cow.</i>

325
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.600
It's a sin what you just said.
And the other two.

326
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.900
Yes, you're right.

327
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
It's a sin.
A delicious sin.

328
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.500
The four of you in one day!
You should be ashamed.

329
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.200
I think you're jealous.

330
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:53.600
Huh.

331
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.000
I hope you drown.

332
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.600
Get him, now!

333
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.600
Andreuccio.

334
00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.300
What was that?

335
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.700
See that?

336
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.400
It's fantastic.
I want that!

337
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.600
Get me that!

338
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.900
Up your ass!

339
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.600
Are you leaving, Father?

340
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.200
In the church...
Gerbino,

341
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.400
he was afraid of me,
wasn't he?

342
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.400
He's afraid of the cross
you wear around your neck.

343
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.100
Allow me to make a
small observation.

344
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.700
All this talk
of virginity.

345
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.600
Yes?

346
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.500
A kissed mouth doesn't
lose its freshness.

347
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.500
Like the moon,
it rises anew again.

348
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.300
-Very poetic I'm sure.
-Just an observation.

349
00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.500
It wasn't me
that said it.

350
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.200
What about
the wedding?

351
00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.600
I'll be there.

352
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.100
<i>But first I had to make
a pilgrimage of my own.</i>

353
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.000
Yesona.

354
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.800
Yesona!

355
00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.900
Yesona, I'm here.

356
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.300
I love you,
my dear.

357
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.500
Yesona, let's take this
ride into the sunset.

358
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.100
You filthy disgusting
beast!

359
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:11.400
Every day I see you...
I am drawn to you.

360
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:19.800
Every night I sleep...
I am with you.

361
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.400
Everyday...

362
00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.200
Every night.

363
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:31.900
I think it's farted up with you,
Filomena, that's the truth of it.

364
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.900
Well, when it comes to farting,
Uncle Bruno, you should know.

365
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.300
Dioneo...

366
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.000
Dioneo!

367
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.700
Stop this sulking!

368
00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.100
I'm not sulking.

369
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.700
Please, Dioneo.
Look at me.

370
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.200
Look at me.

371
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.600
I didn't mean to call
you a filthy beast.

372
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.000
A sweetie pear.
Little honey cucumber.

373
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.700
Please, I'm not a child,
or a cucumber.

374
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.100
But I love you.
I love you, cucumber.

375
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.900
-I love you.
-It was only a dream.

376
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.600
I would never be unfaithful
to you, you know that.

377
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:43.200
It's like being licked by a dog
when you do that, it really is.

378
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:50.400
Hey, listen to me.
I love you and I forgive you.

379
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.700
There, look. You're forgiven
with a proper kiss.

380
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.400
And another.

381
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.600
And another.

382
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.900
And another.

383
00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.300
Dioneo.

384
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.300
Stop this now.

385
00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.100
Me?

386
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.100
Dio, kiss me.

387
00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.600
Kiss me.

388
00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.900
My God.
What's that?

389
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.400
What do you
think it is?

390
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.900
When we're married.
Soon. You'll see.

391
00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.000
What a treasure I
have for you.

392
00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.300
Give me Give me..
Give me the treasure!

393
00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.000
Give me the treasure!
Please.

394
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.800
What's happening? Dioneo!
What's going on?

395
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.400
My God!
What happened?

396
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.000
Nothing. Nothing.

397
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
It may be nothing to you,
Dioneo Dugalante,

398
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.200
but it's a disgrace and
humiliation to me!

399
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.400
One kiss and look
what you've done!

400
00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.500
You had your hand...
right on my root.

401
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.200
I did nothing of the sort.
That's the trouble with you.

402
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.900
You just don't know
when to stop.

403
00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.300
Hello, love.

404
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.600
Good show.

405
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.600
This way please.

406
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.900
Melissa!

407
00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.300
I am Alessandro Felice,

408
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.100
and I am your host.

409
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.500
Welcome.

410
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.800
You're not our host and
we are not your guests.

411
00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:32.400
We are your prisoners.

412
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:40.000
Show us your body. So beautiful.
The world is waiting for girls like you.

413
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.700
Have you travelled?

414
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.000
I've been to Sienna.

415
00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.300
Sienna?

416
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:56.000
Then you must come with me
to Tunisia. You'll like it there.

417
00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.200
-Where is Tunisia?
-Africa.

418
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.700
-Why are you going to Africa?
-To sell slaves,

419
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.100
and to work,
of course.

420
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.000
What do you mean, work?

421
00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.100
It's easy.
It's relaxing work.

422
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.300
You'll will spend most of
the time on your back.

423
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.700
-Over my dead body.
-That can be always be arranged.

424
00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.500
My god... he wants to...?

425
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.200
That is what he
means, isn't it?

426
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.000
What are we
gonna do?

427
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.300
Did you see the
way he looked at us?

428
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.400
He's handsome.
He's sexy.

429
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.600
What do you mean?

430
00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.000
Look, if you want to get out of here alive,
we just have to take control,

431
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.900
lead these dickheads
by the nose.

432
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:30.600
This is what is commonly known...
as a Show Palace.

433
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.800
Sit down and
be a good boy.

434
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.400
Put these on.

435
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:44.800
You're next.

436
00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:53.400
I will not... I will not...
relinquish...

437
00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:57.800
my precious...precious...
jewel.

438
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:06.000
Not until my Diana...
meets my Apollo...

439
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:12.100
and the goddess
Venus... carries me...

440
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.200
oh, please carry me...

441
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.800
to the threshold...
of my Jupiter.

442
00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.300
Who are these guys?

443
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.200
Gods... like you...

444
00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.900
I have waited...
longing...

445
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.300
but still, my Jupiter
has not come.

446
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.300
I pray for him to come me.

447
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.000
Yearn for him to come.

448
00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:54.500
You, my delicious.

449
00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.200
You are my Jupiter.

450
00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:16.100
Filomena, please don't let them
take me away. I need to wee!

451
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.100
Oh shut up,
you stupid fart!

452
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:19.500
You have to hold on!

453
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.500
-What happened?
-It was boring.

454
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.300
All he wanted to
do was look.

455
00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.400
Made me dance around the pole
without my knickers and that was it.

456
00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.100
Where'd you get that?

457
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.600
-I'm next.
-Follow me, do actually as I do. Got it?

458
00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.100
Gentlemen.

459
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.600
Gentlemen!

460
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.500
Your captain has given us to you,
for your delight.

461
00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.200
For your delight!

462
00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:52.500
Hurray!

463
00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.900
This is the lovely
Filomena.

464
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.300
A beauty,
I'll think you'll agree.

465
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.800
Have you ever seen
such glorious breasts?

466
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.200
Show them.

467
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.000
-They like it!

468
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.700
-Gentlemen, let's hear
it for Filomena's breasts.

469
00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:23.900
Now, every person knows that
there is one thing that matters,

470
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.200
the one who gets to go first...

471
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.100
and who goes last.

472
00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.200
Who's the biggest
tomcat in town?

473
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.200
Me, Me, Me, Me!

474
00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:40.000
There is only one way to do it.
Off. Get them off.

475
00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.700
Let's get a look
at the tackle.

476
00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:46.500
Come along. Come along,
in a line, in a line.

477
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.500
All boys together.
Don't be shy.

478
00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:54.000
On the count to three, you big butch bandits,
drop those loons.

479
00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.400
One!

480
00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.800
Two!

481
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.500
Three!

482
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.100
Wonderful...
magnificent.

483
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:08.900
Behold... manhood
in all its glory.

484
00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.600
My God, I never seen
one before!

485
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:16.400
-Now, there's a whole army of them!
-Let's take a closer look.

486
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.900
Order, please, order.
You! Stand up straight!

487
00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.700
Let me see.

488
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:28.900
I think you should swap
places with him.

489
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.800
And... you with him.

490
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.200
Better.

491
00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.400
Where is it?

492
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.600
Oh, there is it.

493
00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.900
That's very small...

494
00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:50.600
and shrively.

495
00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.200
-I hope they're not all like that?
-Thanks very much.

496
00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.200
Looks like the end,
don't you think, Melissa?

497
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.900
Off you go,
chop chop.

498
00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.900
Wonderful display,
well done everyone.

499
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:08.900
Now this is it.

500
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.200
The moment you've
all been waiting for.

501
00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.900
Who...
goes first?

502
00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.600
We do, start with the biggest
and work your way down.

503
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.000
No!. The smallest... start small
and work your way up.

504
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:26.200
We both start in the middle,
and work our way to the end.

505
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.600
-I'm the smallest, I go first.
-You want first, then last?

506
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.000
Watch what you
say, big knob!

507
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.300
-You're asking for a thump.
-Try this for size.

508
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.500
Right, that's it.

509
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.500
Gino!

510
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:59.600
Me next. Come on Gino,
Come one. Hurry up!

511
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.100
Having fun?

512
00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.500
What does it you said,
"over your dead body?"

513
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.700
Naughty man.

514
00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.100
<i>Now comes the news
she didn't want to hear. </i>

515
00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.600
<i>The Count had
arrived in Florence.</i>

516
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.000
<i>Now Pampinea
has a dilemma.</i>

517
00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:44.200
<i>How does she feel about leaving
Lorenzo alone with all those nuns?</i>

518
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.200
How do you know this?

519
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.700
I heard him,
singing in the garden.

520
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.300
-You're certain?
-Very.

521
00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.200
He has a beautiful voice.

522
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.200
It'd just be
hard to resist.

523
00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.800
Goodbye...
and thank you.

524
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:33.900
The butcher's here. He brought a knife.
A very sharp knife.

525
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.900
His ready to cut off your...

526
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.300
Please!

527
00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.900
A miracle!

528
00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.900
I can speak!

529
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.000
Get out!

530
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.400
Your pants.

531
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.000
Are you human?

532
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.600
No, I'm the spirit
of this pool.

533
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.100
An enchantress.

534
00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:57.900
I thought that much.

535
00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:02.800
And... am I now
under your spell?

536
00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.400
Yes. Now that you
have drunk the water.

537
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.400
You're under my spell.

538
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:10.900
Where did you
come from?

539
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.300
Before you became...
an enchantress.

540
00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.500
Florence.

541
00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:17.900
Where are you
travelling to?

542
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.700
To a wedding.

543
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:27.400
-Are you the bride?
-If I were the bride...

544
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:32.200
on my way to be married...
would you be the groom?

545
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:37.300
Well, like you, I'm also travelling
to a wedding, but if...

546
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:38.100
by chance...

547
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:41.600
you were to tell me
that your name...

548
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.800
is Pampinea Anastasi then...

549
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.500
my life would
be complete.

550
00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.700
Because you are,
without question...

551
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:52.100
the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

552
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.300
If I'm Pampinea Anastasi,
then you must be...

553
00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.100
Dmitry Vyacheslav
Alexandrovich Dzerzhinsky,

554
00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:05.500
first son of Alexander
Pyotr Abramovich Dzerzhinsky,

555
00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:08.300
from the Kingdom of
Novgorod and you...

556
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.700
you are Pampinea Anastasi, soon to
be my bride. Is this not true?

557
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.300
No. I'm an
enchantress.

558
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:23.000
And you have
answered my call,

559
00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:24.900
at that special
moment....

560
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.300
when a woman must
make her gift

561
00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.100
of her precious
jewel.

562
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.700
A treasure all women
hold dear...

563
00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.800
the greatest gift a woman
can bestow to a man,

564
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.700
but sometimes you
can't wait.

565
00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.400
You must tell no one
of our meeting.

566
00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.900
<i>Having, succeeding
getting him chucked out,</i>

567
00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.900
<i>Pampinea back tracked
past the convent...</i>

568
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:13.300
<i>just to be certain the nuns weren't
getting what she fancied for herself.</i>

569
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.400
Lorenzo De Lamberti.

570
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.200
Pampinea Anastasi.

571
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:26.000
What are you doing here?

572
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:27.300
You know, just...

573
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.400
enjoying the day.

574
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:31.900
I've been working
in the garden,

575
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.400
escaping the
city life.

576
00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:34.900
A gardener?

577
00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.300
I have a strong
affinity with nature.

578
00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.600
Oh.

579
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:45.100
Well good, we'll see you then.
Maybe. Minghino.

580
00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.300
No, wait, wait, wait.

581
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.000
-Where're you going?
-On my way to be married.

582
00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.200
Ah, I heard about that.

583
00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.300
Some short, fat Russian
from Novgorod?

584
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:04.200
I hear you're very popular...
very much in demand.

585
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.600
You mean
Gerbino De la Ratta?

586
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.400
He's a turd.

587
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:12.300
I hear you're wanted for your debt.
Minghino.

588
00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:16.900
Enjoy your affinity
with nature.

589
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.400
Perhaps I can
come with you and, uh...

590
00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.800
to be your escort.

591
00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:29.100
To deliver you safely
into the arms of your fat Russian.

592
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.500
<i>Like all good pilgrims,
I've followed the path.</i>

593
00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:36.800
<i>I had arrived...</i>

594
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:38.800
<i>Heaven.</i>

595
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:55.300
<i>They say the Mother
Superior at this convent...</i>

596
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.600
<i>is a woman of unparalleled
lust and randiness.</i>

597
00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.700
-Who's there?
-I'm a Holy Father...

598
01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:05.300
in search for a place of
contemplation and prayer.

599
01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.600
I'll take you to
the Holy Mother.

600
01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:18.000
-Father. Have you any skills?
-Such as?

601
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.500
-Gardening, perhaps.
-Gardening? A little.

602
01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.200
Good.

603
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.000
All this silence you see upon,
it's almost as if we were....

604
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:30.600
deaf and dumb.

605
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:36.200
We may see many things, but we
speak nothing of them in here.

606
01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.900
Understand?

607
01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.600
Silence...
Deaf and dumb.

608
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.600
And gardening,
not quite I have in mind.

609
01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:02.500
Would you care...
for a bath?

610
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.800
<i>A bath?
I was in.</i>

611
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.300
Perfect place
for a wedding.

612
01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.600
Nobody's here yet,
we're the first.

613
01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.000
Lorenzo!

614
01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.000
Wait...
Lorenzo.

615
01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.800
You could stay...
just a little longer.

616
01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:26.400
Blindfolded?
Is that really true?

617
01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.100
You were blindfolded
when you kissed her?

618
01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.100
When she kissed me.

619
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.000
You'll soon forget her,
that's what I think.

620
01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.100
You'll forget her
and the kiss.

621
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.600
You, Lorenzo Lamberti...
to tell the truth and all.

622
01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.900
You don't have
to believe me.

623
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.800
How can you be in love with
a woman you've never seen?

624
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.600
Simple.
It was the kiss.

625
01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.400
Everything was in
that one kiss.

626
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.100
How'll you find her?

627
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.900
This woman you've never seen,
locked behind convent doors?

628
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.800
I don't know.

629
01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.300
I don't know,
perhaps you're right.

630
01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.000
I mean, they're not gonna let me
in that convent, that's for sure.

631
01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:25.800
I think it's best you
forget her, Lorenzo.

632
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.000
No, I don't think I can forget her.

633
01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.100
What if you
found her?

634
01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:53.900
What if you found her, kissed her,
and your dream dies?

635
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.100
How will you feel?

636
01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.400
It's not to dream.

637
01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.000
Lorenzo, your memory of the precious
kiss will fade, and temptation will reign.

638
01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.500
You'll see.

639
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.300
Even if I have to kiss
you myself to prove it.

640
01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.600
-Sounds like a challenge?
-Maybe it is.

641
01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.500
You were always the girl
every boy wanted to kiss.

642
01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.000
But?

643
01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.800
But... you were
always too...

644
01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.000
Too what?

645
01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:28.500
Too good,
clever, too...

646
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.000
too beautiful.

647
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.000
Too everything,
always out of reach.

648
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.900
Why don't you kiss
me now, Lorenzo?

649
01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.500
See if I can make
you better.

650
01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:52.300
You mean for all the times that I wanted
to kiss you, but never could?

651
01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:59.200
For all those times,
and more.

652
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.800
Close your eyes.

653
01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.300
Gerbino, I know it.

654
01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.300
It's him!

655
01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:24.100
Run Lorenzo. Please,
he'll kill you for sure.

656
01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.300
Run, Run!

657
01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:31.500
De la Ratta!
You shit.

658
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.600
We could smell
you coming.

659
01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:36.700
Lorenzo!

660
01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.200
Come on! You want
to kill me? Do it!

661
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:41.800
Come on!

662
01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.000
Come on.

663
01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:52.800
Give me a sword!

664
01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:57.300
Give me a stick and I'll cut you!

665
01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.100
Gerbino De la Ratta!
Stop!

666
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.000
Gerbino, leave him!

667
01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.900
Leave him!

668
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.500
I will not marry you.
Never!

669
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.000
Not if you kill him!

670
01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.000
Marry him?

671
01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:30.600
Is that what
this is about?

672
01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.300
You marrying him?

673
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.700
Make a mistake,
you're a dead man.

674
01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:07.400
Kill me today, you'll still
be an ugly shit tomorrow.

675
01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.800
He's in trouble,
Pampinea.

676
01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.300
A lot of trouble.

677
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.400
What kind of trouble?

678
01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:43.800
Theft.

679
01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:46.400
Murder.

680
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.600
I can believe what you say,
you're not first say it.

681
01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.100
But he's only a boy.

682
01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.100
Please.

683
01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.100
Please.

684
01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:03.800
What?

685
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.500
Don't lean over.

686
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.100
What are you doing?
Please.

687
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.400
Listen.

688
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:35.400
-Just... come down.
-You're afraid of heights, aren't you?

689
01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.500
No.

690
01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:42.400
Just don't want
you to fall in.

691
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:43.900
How can I fall?

692
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.800
I've been playing on this
well since I was a child.

693
01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.400
Get down!

694
01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:55.300
Release Lorenzo...
and you can send for the priest.

695
01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.200
Now?

696
01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.100
You'll marry me now?

697
01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:03.900
Yes.

698
01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:07.800
But if I marry you,
and you don't release him,

699
01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.200
and you have blood
on your hands...

700
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.800
then you'll spend the rest
of your life in a cold bed.

701
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.100
Do you understand?

702
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.300
I'll give you nothing of
what I have to give.

703
01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:21.500
You have my word.

704
01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:24.300
I'll send for a priest.

705
01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.200
How the hell do you find
a priest just like that?

706
01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.300
He'll have our balls on
the block if we don't.

707
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.700
-Hey, You!
-What?

708
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.300
Father.
Where're you going?

709
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.800
To Pampinea's father's house...

710
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.200
to the wedding?

711
01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:49.100
How did you know we wanted a priest
when we've just been sent to get one?

712
01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.500
The word of God
travels fast.

713
01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.100
Hey, don't I know you?

714
01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.200
Your face is
very familiar.

715
01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:00.000
It's the clothes,
all priests looks the same.

716
01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:17.200
You must go. Leave before
he changes his mind.

717
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.400
Are you really
going to marry him?

718
01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:20.900
Not your concern.

719
01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.400
The priest's here.

720
01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.200
Leave while you can.

721
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
He wants hear our confessions
before the wedding.

722
01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.300
I'll go first.

723
01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.200
I'm sorry, just to be clear.

724
01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.600
How many potential
husbands you have right now?

725
01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:54.200
-Three.
-And which one do you want?

726
01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.600
Lorenzo!

727
01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.800
I love only Lorenzo.

728
01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.300
But you haven't met the Count,
the one you promised to marry.

729
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.500
You could fall in
love with him.

730
01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:05.200
-No, I love only Lorenzo.
-Does he love you?

731
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.500
Yes. No. I mean he loves me but
he just doesn't know it yet.

732
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.000
It's not easy
being a priest.

733
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.100
Please delay as
long as you can.

734
01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.700
and I realized that...

735
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.100
stealing other people's money was far
easier than working for my own.

736
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.600
All those killings?
How many people?

737
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
-I can't remember.
-That's quite a list.

738
01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.700
Not to mention what you
did to your father.

739
01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.200
Do I know you?

740
01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.000
Your face is familiar,
I'm sure I know you.

741
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.100
It's the clothes.
All priests looks the same.

742
01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:44.700
To absolve yourself...

743
01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:49.200
from these terrible sins and
to have any hope for an eternal salvation.

744
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.600
you must abstain from all sexual
thoughts and all sexual deeds..

745
01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.300
for a period of 30 days.

746
01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.300
But I'm just about to be married!

747
01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:01.400
How can I abstain
from sex for 30 days?

748
01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.500
That's... mean!

749
01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.900
And stupid.

750
01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:11.100
Well of course, if you
do something really stupid...

751
01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:14.000
then you must expect to suffer so we
can remain stupid in return...

752
01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:18.000
just to show you how stupid
you were in the first place.

753
01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.600
It's called a penance.

754
01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:27.000
That's... really,
really stupid.

755
01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:31.700
God works in
mysterious ways.

756
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:36.400
<i>Well, I had him by the nuts...
that's for sure.</i>

757
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.700
<i>But how long could I squeeze,
before he squeezes mine?</i>

758
01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.500
You know Gerbino sent us
along to kill you, don't you?

759
01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.600
I kind of guessed that.

760
01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.700
Dirty business, killing.

761
01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:56.200
-I'd rather be a gardener.
-I know just the place.

762
01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:00.500
Listen.
We could let you go.

763
01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:03.200
But you must
promise not to tell.

764
01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.000
Really?

765
01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.800
-I promise.
-Good.

766
01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.200
Ow! God that hurts!

767
01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.100
That really, really hurts.

768
01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:32.800
Is this the road to the villa of
Pampinea Anastasi?

769
01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.600
-It's that way.
-I thank you.

770
01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:38.300
Who are you?

771
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I am Count Dmitry Vyacheslav
Alexandrovich Dzerzhinsky...!

772
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.200
Ah!
The short fat Russian

773
01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:07.900
Witness, all of you.

774
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.400
You are Gerbino De la Ratta?

775
01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:14.500
You know who I am.

776
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.100
Please don't be difficult.

777
01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.100
How can I marry you if you
don't answer the question?

778
01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.900
Are you Gerbino De la Ratta?

779
01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.300
I am.

780
01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.500
-You are Pampinea Anastasi?
-I am, Father.

781
01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:34.600
And when did you both last
take confession? Pampinea?

782
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.300
I've taken confession on
this day, Father.

783
01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.100
-Did you confess all your sins?
-I did, Father.

784
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.100
Gerbino De la Ratta.

785
01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.900
When did you last
take confession?

786
01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.200
-You know when I last took confession.
-Bad answer.

787
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.600
"I have taken confession
on this day, Father."

788
01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.800
-I have taken confession on this day.
-Father.

789
01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.700
Father.

790
01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:06.700
Then do you both come to me,
pure in body and soul. Answer I do.

791
01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:09.400
- I do.
- I do.

792
01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.000
- Have you bathed?
- What?!

793
01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:13.200
Pampinea?

794
01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.700
I have bathed on this day of days
which is my marriage day.

795
01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:22.100
Witness all of you, this woman comes
to us pure, in both body and soul.

796
01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.200
Gerbino De la Ratta.

797
01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.800
Have you bathed on this day
of days, that is your wedding day?

798
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.600
- Yes.
- When did you bathe?

799
01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:33.700
- I just told you I bathed!
- When exactly, when did you last take a bath?

800
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.300
I have bathed!

801
01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.900
Thoroughly? All the bits
and pieces, downstairs....

802
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.300
-In between your legs?
-What?

803
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:42.600
Show me your hands.

804
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.200
-You got dirt under your nails.
-Where?

805
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.900
There. I cannot marry you if
you have dirty fingernails.

806
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.400
That's ridiculous...
I've never heard anything so ridiculous.

807
01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.400
I can hardly say, witness all of you,

808
01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.700
this man comes to us pure
in both body and soul,

809
01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.700
but with dirty fingernails.
Now can I?

810
01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.300
You must wash your hands.

811
01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.000
At the very least.

812
01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:29.100
-There.
-Thank you.

813
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.200
He's only doing his job.

814
01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.900
Exactly.

815
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:43.000
Incidentally, there is a
charge for my services.

816
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.200
This is very jolly.

817
01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.500
Pour this fine wine...

818
01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.200
a little young perhaps, fine,
fresh fruit, with a...

819
01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.700
a musty, a
musty hint...

820
01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:32.300
a musty hint of what I can
really only describe as a stale fart...

821
01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.600
rather like the combination of
this couple here before me today.

822
01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.900
Marry us now,
you bastard!

823
01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:41.700
I declare you man and wife.
There, it's done.

824
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.500
You're married. Relax, enjoy.
Consummate, whatever you want, really.

825
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.200
Hey!

826
01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:00.000
I'm Count Dmitry Vyacheslav
Alexandrovich Dzerzhinsky...

827
01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:04.600
first son of Alexander
Pyotr Abramovich Dzerzhinsky...

828
01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:10.100
from the Kingdom of Novgorod.
I am here to marry Pampinea Anastasi.

829
01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:13.300
I will kill any man who
tries to stop me.

830
01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:17.200
You're too late.
Pampinea Anastasi is already married.

831
01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.100
This is my wife.

832
01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:22.200
This is house.
This is my land.

833
01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.800
And I advise you to leave while you
still have air to breathe.

834
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.700
This lady may
be your wife,

835
01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:29.900
but I'm sorry to tell you,
she's about to become a widow.

836
01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.800
You piece of rat.

837
01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:36.200
You killed four of my men who
were close to my heart.

838
01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.600
You stole their lives.

839
01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.800
And now you must pay!

840
01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.800
Lorenzo!

841
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.500
Run!

842
01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.300
-Where did he go?
-I don't know.

843
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.400
-You go that way, I'll go this way.
-Who are you?

844
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.500
Lorenzo Lamberti.

845
01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:39.900
The robber on the road. Yes!
I am Count Dmitry Alexandro...

846
01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.800
I know, I know.

847
01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.900
First son!

848
01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:48.200
Only son,
nine sisters.

849
01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:56.300
Gerbino De la Ratta.

850
01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.100
Get her and bring
her to me.

851
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.800
Kill them and throw
them down to me.

852
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.100
Hello.

853
01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.800
Tell me...
Are you ready to die?

854
01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.000
How awful.
You dropped your little sword.

855
01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:24.800
Pick it up.

856
01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.500
Fight me.

857
01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:30.000
Fight me or I'll kill
you anyway.

858
01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.700
Wait.

859
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:34.900
There's some unfinished business.

860
01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.000
Is that not right,
Gerbino?

861
01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.400
You want to kill me?
Why don't you come up here and join me?

862
01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.500
I'm sorry my friend.
I've sworn to kill this man.

863
01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.000
You kill him before I kill him,
I may have to kill you.

864
01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.100
Here, let this decide.

865
01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.500
Alright, if you want.

866
01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.900
Why not join him.

867
01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:06.800
I'll fight him.

868
01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:09.700
But don't step in.

869
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.300
I may step in.

870
01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:18.300
I may step out.

871
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.500
I may even decide to have
a little dance with you.

872
01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.400
but don't worry my friend.

873
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:30.100
If he kills you,
I'll kill him, either way,

874
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:31.600
you're going to die.

875
01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:07.500
Do you need help
getting up?

876
01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.400
Kill him... Kill him!

877
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.900
Put your sword
into his heart!

878
01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.300
Still a gambler, Gerbino.
Want to make a bet?

879
01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.900
Go that way,
you're dead.

880
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.200
Come this way
to me, dead.

881
01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:17.100
Go that way...
well, who knows?

882
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.100
Going down.

883
01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.000
Oh, Shit!

884
01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:59.200
Friend.
Take my advice.

885
01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:02.400
Do not drink water
from this well.

886
01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:09.300
Sorry.

887
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.800
-So that one's Lorenzo?
-Yes.

888
01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:25.300
By the way I'm not really a priest.
So you're not really married.

889
01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:26.800
I thought you should know.

890
01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:39.300
-Count Dzerzhinsky!
-Pampinea Anastasi.

891
01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:44.400
I have travelled here to you,
from my beloved Novogrod.

892
01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.200
To keep faith to fulfill
my promise, to marry you...

893
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.100
and to make you my wife.

894
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.700
I'm here.
Hello.

895
01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:59.400
Count Dzerzhinsky. You are one of the bravest,
most handsome men I've ever met.

896
01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.200
Yes, I know.

897
01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:03.100
But I cannot
marry you.

898
01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:15.200
How can you say this after everything
that has happened between us?

899
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.200
But... you are not
Pampinea Anastasi.

900
01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:31.800
-She...is Pampinea Anastasi..
-Melissa!

901
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.400
-You know her?
-Know her?

902
01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:39.800
I am in love with her.

903
01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:55.000
Melissa, really,
kissing a perfect stranger.

904
01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:59.100
This doesn't look much like
a wedding, what's going on?

905
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.400
Filomena, there is going
to be a wedding!

906
01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:03.900
I hope there is going
to be a wedding.

907
01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:06.300
Lorenzo?

908
01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:08.600
Where are you?

909
01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.300
Lorenzo!

910
01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:29.500
Lorenzo!

911
01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:40.300
Lorenzo!

912
01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:44.100
You have stolen my heart.
I love you.

913
01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:51.100
I love you.

914
01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.300
Pampinea...

915
01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.400
You're one of the most...
no...

916
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:07.600
the most beautiful girl,
I've ever seen.

917
01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:11.200
But I gave my heart to a kiss,
I can't let go.

918
01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.300
If only I could forget her.
I must find her.

919
01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:24.900
Lorenzo, close your eyes.
Please.

920
01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:28.300
Just close your eyes.

921
01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:40.800
Every day I see you...
I'm drawn to you.

922
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.500
Every night as I come
beyond for you.

923
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.200
Every day.
Every night.

924
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:04.900
You...

925
01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:09.800
You.

926
01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:15.700
Now will you forget her?
This girl you kissed?

927
01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:19.800
Never.

928
01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:44.300
<i>So, this is my reward.</i>

929
01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.600
<i>I get to stand over
here like a daisy....</i>

930
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.100
<i>while this lot...</i>

931
01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:51.600
<i>well... you can see
for yourselves.</i>

932
01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:58.000
So tra la tra la,
heads up...oohh

933
01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.000
<i>Romance.</i>

934
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.700
<i>Passion.</i>

935
01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:12.100
<i>Alright, to hell with this.
I'm back off to the convent.</i>

936
01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:16.400
<i>There's an angel there and
her bottom's got my name on it</i>

937
01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.700
Close your eyes again.

938
01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.000
No...

939
01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.400
You close yours.
