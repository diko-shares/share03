00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:55.758
<i>On my late father's advice...</i>

2
00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:57.172
<i>I first became a thief.</i>

3
00:00:57.763 --> 00:01:00.537
<i>but then I discovered thieving
gets your hands cut off.</i>

4
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.720
<i>or your feet smashed
with a hammer.</i>

5
00:01:04.137 --> 00:01:06.520
<i>or hanged...
like my father.</i>

6
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:10.684
<i>So I gave up being a thief
and did the next best thing.</i>

7
00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:13.067
<i>I joined the church.</i>

8
00:01:13.102 --> 00:01:15.247
<i>Not a priest,
though it has good prospects.</i>

9
00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:16.484
<i>No.</i>

10
00:01:16.897 --> 00:01:19.371
<i> As a painter,
an artist.</i>

11
00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:25.702
<i>I could do it all.
Angels, devils, virgins and nuns.</i>

12
00:01:26.137 --> 00:01:29.867
<i>Painting bums on angels is not
a bad way of earning a living.</i>

13
00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:31.512
<i>And I was happy.</i>

14
00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:34.444
<i>Then everything changed.</i>

15
00:01:35.452 --> 00:01:37.473
<i>Not just for me....
for everyone.</i>

16
00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:41.653
<i>The rich, the poor,
everyone...</i>

17
00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:45.015
<i>This boy, Lorenzo, he's always in trouble,
always pushing his luck.</i>

18
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:51.266
<i>Lorenzo's a gambler, a winner,
but his luck is running out.</i>

19
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:53.986
<i>This time he's won
against the wrong person.</i>

20
00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.390
Gerbino De la Ratta.

21
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.929
<i>They had this fight, you see.
And Gerbino's a bad loser.</i>

22
00:02:59.964 --> 00:03:02.462
<i>A really bad loser.</i>

23
00:03:02.497 --> 00:03:06.813
<i>Gerbino De la Ratta would resent
losing a dirty sock in a wager.</i>

24
00:03:06.848 --> 00:03:09.386
<i>That's the kind
of person he is.</i>

25
00:03:10.622 --> 00:03:15.111
-Come down here and fight.
-So you can put a scar like that on my cheek?

26
00:03:15.346 --> 00:03:19.653
I'd improve your looks, you ugly shit,
but I'm far too beautiful.

27
00:03:31.972 --> 00:03:33.606
You're next.

28
00:03:35.154 --> 00:03:37.816
Into the shit,
where you belong.

29
00:03:39.123 --> 00:03:40.277
Why is he still alive,
Andreuccio?

30
00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:41.961
I told you,
I want him dead.

31
00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:58.165
<i>Lorenzo De Lamberti was not the
first to have a thing for Pampinea Anastasi.</i>

32
00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.722
<i>Although he was the
last one to admit.</i>

33
00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.865
<i>The richest girl in town,
Pampinea is not so much spoiled...</i>

34
00:04:07.134 --> 00:04:09.790
<i>as laviously as
overindulged.</i>

35
00:04:10.092 --> 00:04:12.100
<i>Poor little rich girl.</i>

36
00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:16.154
<i>But that was before the plague.
Not now.</i>

37
00:04:16.296 --> 00:04:17.966
<i>Everything's changed.</i>

38
00:04:18.501 --> 00:04:20.884
<i>Even for Pampinea.</i>

39
00:04:29.787 --> 00:04:31.731
Lorenzo, quick!

40
00:04:31.866 --> 00:04:33.711
Gerbino's waiting for
you at your house.

41
00:04:33.947 --> 00:04:36.031
He won't rest until
you're dead.

42
00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:39.754
Get the hell out.
Now!

43
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.612
<i>Having painted the bums on 14 angels,
I was still waiting to be paid.</i>

44
00:05:00.787 --> 00:05:03.584
-Did you tell him?
-He's still asleep.

45
00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:05.967
You wait there.

46
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:09.262
There.

47
00:05:12.703 --> 00:05:15.844
The Plague.
Just my luck.

48
00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:18.193
Looks like we're
not getting paid.

49
00:05:19.404 --> 00:05:22.618
Go home.
You're done here.

50
00:05:23.905 --> 00:05:26.253
<i>Then I heard voices.</i>

51
00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:35.530
<i>Come and join us.
Priests, right!</i>

52
00:05:35.565 --> 00:05:36.968
<i>They got it all!</i>

53
00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.065
Food, money.

54
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.281
<i>And of course,
the key to the convent.</i>

55
00:05:42.316 --> 00:05:45.156
<i>All those beautiful nuns.</i>

56
00:05:50.697 --> 00:05:55.765
<i>Rumor has it Gerbino De la Ratta
is a bit short on his equipment.</i>

57
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.571
<i>You know, not much going on
downstairs in the trouser department.</i>

58
00:06:01.206 --> 00:06:05.564
<i>It's funny, cause I always thought
he was the biggest dick in town.</i>

59
00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:20.843
Pampinea.

60
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.536
I offer my sympathy.

61
00:06:27.177 --> 00:06:29.401
-Thank you.
-It's a tragedy.

62
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.495
This plague...

63
00:06:32.564 --> 00:06:33.526
terrible

64
00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:35.097
terrible...

65
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:36.606
tragedy.

66
00:06:38.111 --> 00:06:40.685
What would you do now,
Pampinea?

67
00:06:42.084 --> 00:06:44.392
I promised to marry
Count Dzerzhinsky.

68
00:06:44.427 --> 00:06:46.929
He's on his way here
from Russia to marry me.

69
00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.224
Thank you for
your assistance.

70
00:07:00.515 --> 00:07:01.876
Pampinea.

71
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:05.883
Before he died, your father
asked me to protect you.

72
00:07:05.918 --> 00:07:09.142
-From what?
-His estate.

73
00:07:09.177 --> 00:07:14.321
He was in debt.
Massive in debt, with his businesses failing.

74
00:07:17.424 --> 00:07:20.338
To whom?
To whom was he in debt?

75
00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:25.827
Business people.
Merchants. But I paid them off.

76
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.677
You?

77
00:07:27.712 --> 00:07:29.948
It's what's known
as a secured loan.

78
00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:32.536
Your father borrowed money
from me, to pay his debt...

79
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:35.174
against the security of this house
and all his other assets.

80
00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:37.723
All this. None of this
belongs to him anymore.

81
00:07:37.792 --> 00:07:41.613
-Who does it belong to then?
-Me.

82
00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:46.118
Unless you pay me
the money he owed.

83
00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:50.279
You don't have to worry about that
Pampinea, I'm here for you.

84
00:07:50.614 --> 00:07:54.137
Your father and I discussed this
before he died, and he agreed.

85
00:07:54.172 --> 00:07:58.224
-Agreed to what?
-That you should marry me.

86
00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:01.100
I'm promised to marry
Count Dzerzhinsky!

87
00:08:01.135 --> 00:08:05.823
This is a badly arranged marriage.
Your father told me before he died...

88
00:08:06.056 --> 00:08:07.293
he much prefered me.

89
00:08:10.368 --> 00:08:14.302
Pampinea, I'm
devoted to you.

90
00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:19.295
Marry me.

91
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.427
I'm yours to command.

92
00:08:24.024 --> 00:08:26.788
May I kiss your hand?

93
00:09:06.938 --> 00:09:10.963
That's always been a problem isn't it.
You know. Theocracy.

94
00:09:15.708 --> 00:09:18.582
She should've done something about
about that, it doesn't cost anything, does it?

95
00:09:18.817 --> 00:09:21.025
Hey you!
Where does this road lead?

96
00:09:22.432 --> 00:09:26.057
-Bet your wondering what I'm doing?
-No, not really. No.

97
00:09:26.092 --> 00:09:28.290
-My friend.
-What's the matter with him? Is he drunk?

98
00:09:28.325 --> 00:09:31.770
-No.... Guess.
-What, is he dead?

99
00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:33.804
Right!
Good guess!

100
00:09:34.605 --> 00:09:36.802
"I'm dead, checked out..."

101
00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:39.982
-Please tell me, where does this road lead to?
-I'm gonna tell you the answer...

102
00:09:40.017 --> 00:09:43.307
to this one, because you'll never
guess and we'll be standing here all day.

103
00:09:43.342 --> 00:09:46.388
-That's what I was thinking.
-This road leads to...

104
00:09:46.423 --> 00:09:50.549
Wait for it... the Sacred Sisters
of the Bleedin' Heart.

105
00:09:50.584 --> 00:09:53.274
The convent.
What was he doing in a convent?

106
00:09:53.309 --> 00:09:58.645
What was he doing in a convent?
We'll give you a clue.

107
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.298
-He was working there as a...
- A gardener?

108
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:06.936
Right again!
Very clever.

109
00:10:06.971 --> 00:10:09.624
-Do they need a new gardener?
-Do you have special skills.

110
00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:12.084
That's not a trick question,
he has special skills.

111
00:10:12.119 --> 00:10:16.170
-Like what, dying?
-No. Guess. Come on, Guess!

112
00:10:16.205 --> 00:10:20.481
-I don't know. How the hell should I know?
-Don't get dirty.

113
00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:23.620
-What then, what?!
-Ow, together!

114
00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:28.427
-Come on, tell me!
-He was deaf and dumb.

115
00:10:28.462 --> 00:10:32.966
Deaf, therefore dumb.
I told you, he had special skills.

116
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:36.824
Being deaf and dumb is not a skill.
It's a handicap.

117
00:10:36.859 --> 00:10:39.939
For him it weren't.
Bye!

118
00:10:43.746 --> 00:10:46.863
Hello there!
I bet you're wondering what I'm...

119
00:12:06.644 --> 00:12:09.143
Straight from heaven.

120
00:12:17.102 --> 00:12:19.182
He's beautiful.

121
00:12:20.128 --> 00:12:21.100
Strong.

122
00:12:23.086 --> 00:12:24.366
Look at him,
he's....

123
00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:27.579
beautiful.

124
00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:36.019
-Is he hurt?
-I don't know.

125
00:12:38.798 --> 00:12:41.634
Do you think we should take off his clothes
to see if he's broken any bones?

126
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.952
I think we should...

127
00:12:46.553 --> 00:12:47.735
just to be sure.

128
00:12:49.719 --> 00:12:51.404
Where should we start?

129
00:13:22.929 --> 00:13:24.857
Your turn.

130
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.008
His mouth.
Kiss his mouth.

131
00:14:03.757 --> 00:14:05.877
Sisters?

132
00:14:15.385 --> 00:14:18.032
Mother,
he's alive.

133
00:14:18.978 --> 00:14:22.460
He's said nothing, Mother.
We believe he's deaf and dumb.

134
00:14:28.437 --> 00:14:31.541
Can you hear?

135
00:14:38.778 --> 00:14:41.201
Can you....
speak?

136
00:14:45.059 --> 00:14:47.030
A miracle.

137
00:14:47.444 --> 00:14:49.678
An angel.
He fell from heaven.

138
00:14:53.923 --> 00:14:55.815
Take him to
the bath rooms.

139
00:15:00.243 --> 00:15:01.606
Clean him.

140
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.618
<i>For the first
time in her life...</i>

141
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.198
<i>Pampinea Anastasi feels
the need for friends.</i>

142
00:16:12.277 --> 00:16:12.908
Filomena!

143
00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:16.896
Did you tell the others?

144
00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:19.622
We'll meet them
in the church.

145
00:16:37.898 --> 00:16:41.341
Alright you lot.
Girls in front, boys step back.

146
00:16:43.213 --> 00:16:46.905
Quino, I didn't expect to see
you here, I must say.

147
00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:48.981
You can say, but you're
not allow to talk.

148
00:16:49.288 --> 00:16:52.194
No problem, I'm sure you have
enough to say for everyone, for me.

149
00:16:55.568 --> 00:16:58.558
-This is the girl you wanted to marry?
-Can't wait.

150
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.716
I could eat her alive.

151
00:17:01.169 --> 00:17:03.667
My father has a house in the country.
A villa.

152
00:17:04.502 --> 00:17:06.882
We could all go there
to escape the plague.

153
00:17:07.017 --> 00:17:08.320
Good...
let's go.

154
00:17:08.355 --> 00:17:11.536
My parent's dying wish was that I
was to marry Count Dzerzhinsky.

155
00:17:11.871 --> 00:17:13.833
The marriage will take
place at the villa.

156
00:17:14.903 --> 00:17:15.995
You'll all be guests.

157
00:17:16.111 --> 00:17:18.461
Pampinea.
This is an arranged marriage, yes?

158
00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:21.791
Maybe you should try it first.
At least take a look.

159
00:17:21.792 --> 00:17:22.804
Melissa!

160
00:17:23.005 --> 00:17:25.173
That is an insult to Pampinea's
pledge to chastity.

161
00:17:25.208 --> 00:17:28.995
-We're all virgins here.
-Yes, but some are more virgin than others.

162
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.182
Speak for yourself.

163
00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:34.254
I would rather die than relinquish
my virginity before marriage.

164
00:17:34.489 --> 00:17:36.901
I always thought you had
a thing for Lorenzo.

165
00:17:36.936 --> 00:17:38.417
What's this?

166
00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:47.179
What are you doing here,
all of you?

167
00:17:47.682 --> 00:17:48.320
Praying.

168
00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:50.939
We're praying for the dead.

169
00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:56.274
Any one of you thinking of leaving the
city could prove extremely dangerous.

170
00:17:57.109 --> 00:18:00.867
Go home.
All of you, like good children.

171
00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:13.447
I recognize these two.
They're friends of Di Lamberti's.

172
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.119
Perhaps we should
take a walk.

173
00:18:19.327 --> 00:18:20.421
<i>I knew I should have
kept my mouth shut.</i>

174
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:21.392
<i>What do I care?</i>

175
00:18:21.746 --> 00:18:23.203
<i>Even if he was
going to kill them.</i>

176
00:18:23.904 --> 00:18:25.909
<i>Then I heard those
damn noises again.</i>

177
00:18:25.944 --> 00:18:31.210
<i>Keep your mouth shut! Keep your mouth shut!
Keep your mouth shut...</i>

178
00:18:31.312 --> 00:18:34.273
<i>Keep your mouth shut!</i>

179
00:18:35.593 --> 00:18:38.660
<i>Oh, what the hell!
I always did have a big trap.</i>

180
00:18:43.491 --> 00:18:45.456
You! All of you, leave.

181
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.563
Take your swords and
leave the church!

182
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.506
This is Gerbino De la Ratta.

183
00:18:52.625 --> 00:18:54.072
No one speaks
to him like that.

184
00:18:54.207 --> 00:18:58.133
This is the house of God,
and I speak with his voice.

185
00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:11.872
Who are you?

186
00:19:11.907 --> 00:19:14.560
I'm the servant of God.
I speak with his voice.

187
00:19:14.595 --> 00:19:18.606
You wear the cross of our Lord.
When did you last take confession?

188
00:19:18.641 --> 00:19:21.860
The plague that walks our
streets, steals our soul.

189
00:19:21.895 --> 00:19:23.981
It's the Armageddon.

190
00:19:25.418 --> 00:19:28.217
See your face again,

191
00:19:28.252 --> 00:19:31.358
I'll take your blood and
send it to your maker.

192
00:19:35.379 --> 00:19:37.005
Gerbino!

193
00:19:39.353 --> 00:19:42.041
Is he dead?
Lorenzo Di Lamberti?

194
00:19:42.076 --> 00:19:44.385
If I were you,
I'd consider him dead

195
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.413
<i>I've never talked such
bollocks in all my life.</i>

196
00:19:54.448 --> 00:19:56.796
<i>Thank God for
being a priest..</i>

197
00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:03.321
Is this it?

198
00:20:04.437 --> 00:20:06.216
I thought you said you
could get a carriage.

199
00:20:07.253 --> 00:20:08.194
This is Uncle Bruno.

200
00:20:08.928 --> 00:20:10.907
He's not very bright
but he's very strong.

201
00:20:11.171 --> 00:20:12.564
Isn't that right
Uncle Bruno?

202
00:20:14.468 --> 00:20:17.079
And he's a virgin.
Aren't you, Uncle Bruno?

203
00:20:17.587 --> 00:20:20.748
I am.
I'm saving myself.

204
00:20:23.299 --> 00:20:27.914
-Who's that?
-It's the priest, Father Tindaro.

205
00:20:27.949 --> 00:20:30.411
If this to be a wedding,
you'll need a priest.

206
00:20:32.419 --> 00:20:36.439
<i>After hanging around in the square for
a couple of hours waiting for Pampinea,</i>

207
00:20:37.065 --> 00:20:39.450
<i>we discovered she'd gone to a convent</i>

208
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:42.669
to escape from Gerbino and
wait for her Russian Count.

209
00:20:44.299 --> 00:20:48.198
<i>What better place to preserve her virginity
than amongst other virgins?</i>

210
00:20:49.557 --> 00:20:51.639
<i>Or so she thought.</i>

211
00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.163
-Who's that man?
-Oh, he's our gardener.

212
00:21:01.866 --> 00:21:04.060
Sent from heaven.

213
00:21:06.453 --> 00:21:10.538
-He's dead and dumb.
-What?

214
00:21:10.573 --> 00:21:13.036
He can't hear or
speak a word.

215
00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:17.061
How sad. He looks as if he'd have
a lot to say for himself.

216
00:21:18.615 --> 00:21:22.586
Hear no evil,
speak no evil.

217
00:21:34.569 --> 00:21:36.689
Hey!
Come here!

218
00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:50.841
<i>Now jealousy is
a funny thing.</i>

219
00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:53.035
<i>It creeps up on you,
takes you by surprise.</i>

220
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:57.575
<i>Distracted, Pampinea's Russian
Count has slipped from her mind.</i>

221
00:22:44.056 --> 00:22:46.630
What is that?

222
00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:02.878
I am here,
hello.

223
00:23:04.551 --> 00:23:08.579
I bring gifts for you, your wife...
and your daughter...

224
00:23:09.782 --> 00:23:10.991
soon to be my wife.

225
00:23:11.026 --> 00:23:13.142
You're Pampinea's father,
yes?

226
00:23:13.674 --> 00:23:16.459
I am Pampinea's father,
no

227
00:23:16.672 --> 00:23:17.649
No?

228
00:23:25.026 --> 00:23:28.122
I'm Gerbino De la Ratta,
Pampinea's husband to be.

229
00:23:39.027 --> 00:23:41.296
Sir, there has been a mistake.

230
00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:45.688
Pampinea Anastasi is supposed
to be married to me.

231
00:23:47.996 --> 00:23:51.892
Count. You don't mind
me calling you a Count, do you?

232
00:23:53.596 --> 00:23:56.131
You look like a big
Count to me...

233
00:23:57.228 --> 00:24:00.862
Pampinea Anastasi's
soon to be my wife.

234
00:24:00.897 --> 00:24:05.138
You just didn't hear about it...
That... is the mistake.

235
00:24:08.771 --> 00:24:15.655
So you bring me all the way from Novgorod
to tell me that Pampinea Anastasi...

236
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:20.423
is marrying a man who is
old enough to be her father, yes?

237
00:24:22.052 --> 00:24:25.342
I did not bring you here,
but I suggest you leave.

238
00:24:26.402 --> 00:24:30.149
Florence is very bad for the
health this time of year.

239
00:24:33.558 --> 00:24:36.995
Gerbino De la Ratta.

240
00:24:38.345 --> 00:24:40.428
De la Rat...Huh?

241
00:24:42.234 --> 00:24:46.192
A rat is a small furry animal,
yes?

242
00:24:47.214 --> 00:24:48.661
Yes.

243
00:24:49.528 --> 00:24:51.250
Yes, I thought as much.

244
00:25:04.102 --> 00:25:05.352
Sir!

245
00:25:06.451 --> 00:25:10.159
Sir, I'm Linguino, servant to  Pampinea
Anastasi. She's safe and well.

246
00:25:10.651 --> 00:25:13.195
And no matter what you hear,
is waiting for your arrival...

247
00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:17.564
This letter will give you instructions on
how to get to her villa in the country.

248
00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:19.242
She'll meet you there
for the wedding.

249
00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.773
Sir, you are in danger here.
You ride straight to the villa,

250
00:25:30.188 --> 00:25:31.251
be there as soon
as you can.

251
00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:33.971
For Pampinea,
I will do this.

252
00:26:09.271 --> 00:26:11.844
We know you cannot hear
or speak to us,

253
00:26:12.146 --> 00:26:16.310
but to us, you are beautiful like an angel
sent from heaven to bring us joy.

254
00:26:16.345 --> 00:26:22.400
And we pray that God might restore the
miracle of speech to you and your hearing,

255
00:26:22.435 --> 00:26:25.578
so that you can hear
the birds sing and...

256
00:26:26.072 --> 00:26:28.228
-Get on with it!
-I am!

257
00:26:28.263 --> 00:26:30.689
-He has no idea what you're saying.
-Then you do it!

258
00:26:34.641 --> 00:26:37.650
We know that this morning you met
Sister Catherina in the orchards

259
00:26:37.685 --> 00:26:40.224
and then Sister
Melissabeta in the granary.

260
00:26:40.259 --> 00:26:42.987
We want what
you gave them.

261
00:26:43.022 --> 00:26:44.993
And we want it now.

262
00:26:46.014 --> 00:26:47.415
Come on.

263
00:26:57.652 --> 00:27:01.208
<i>There to Florence, there
I was, stuck on that cart,</i>

264
00:27:01.736 --> 00:27:04.016
<i>listening to Uncle Bruno farting
more than the horse,</i>

265
00:27:04.694 --> 00:27:07.478
<i>and Miss Randy Pants ranting
on about being a virgin.</i>

266
00:27:08.433 --> 00:27:11.725
<i>Truth is, those that rattle on
about it, can't wait to do it.</i>

267
00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:15.124
<i>God, there she
goes again.</i>

268
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.523
I'm very proud of my virginity,
Melissa. And so is Dioneo.

269
00:27:20.458 --> 00:27:21.950
<i>The boyfriend, Dioneo.</i>

270
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:25.165
<i>He's suffering from terminal
randiness as well.</i>

271
00:27:26.209 --> 00:27:27.725
<i>Never done it in his life.</i>

272
00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:28.715
Dioneo!

273
00:27:29.916 --> 00:27:32.158
We don't indulge in sex
do we?

274
00:27:32.293 --> 00:27:35.538
Not in broad daylight, in the middle
of the road, we don't, no.

275
00:27:36.211 --> 00:27:39.281
I say, we believe in no
sex before marriage.

276
00:27:39.282 --> 00:27:41.129
We're happy to wait,
aren't we?

277
00:27:41.164 --> 00:27:42.822
Forever my love.

278
00:27:43.766 --> 00:27:44.473
<i>Liar.</i>

279
00:27:52.212 --> 00:27:54.180
Who's that?

280
00:27:55.241 --> 00:27:56.566
Are they waving at us?

281
00:27:57.324 --> 00:27:59.419
No, I think they're
waving at me.

282
00:28:02.937 --> 00:28:04.531
See what they want,
quick before they leave!

283
00:28:04.832 --> 00:28:05.574
Me?

284
00:28:05.609 --> 00:28:07.707
Run, before they
run into Filomena!

285
00:28:08.125 --> 00:28:12.059
No, no.
You go. You go.

286
00:28:28.019 --> 00:28:29.758
Do we want any
milk or bread?

287
00:28:30.593 --> 00:28:32.600
They said their produce
is very fresh...

288
00:28:32.787 --> 00:28:34.906
and we might want to sample it,
back at their farm.

289
00:28:40.811 --> 00:28:42.439
It's too late.

290
00:28:43.954 --> 00:28:45.770
We can get to them.
Come on.

291
00:28:46.716 --> 00:28:47.664
Come on!

292
00:29:01.008 --> 00:29:02.638
Help yourself.

293
00:29:03.316 --> 00:29:04.908
Fresh milk,
there it is.

294
00:29:05.626 --> 00:29:07.987
How do you get
milk out of that?

295
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.318
City boys.

296
00:29:12.454 --> 00:29:15.480
Where we come from,
milk comes out of the jug.

297
00:29:15.515 --> 00:29:17.563
I bet you could do it
if you tried.

298
00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:21.281
Show us.

299
00:29:27.346 --> 00:29:28.898
This is how it's done.

300
00:29:29.996 --> 00:29:32.267
See how it fits nicely
into my hand?

301
00:29:33.402 --> 00:29:36.203
I love this thing in my hand.
Don't you, Mira?

302
00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:38.282
Wonderful.

303
00:29:38.866 --> 00:29:41.908
You'd almost say a little
firmer would be better.

304
00:29:42.553 --> 00:29:44.672
Too late,
can't stop now.

305
00:29:52.731 --> 00:29:56.741
Take it firmly in your
hand and squeeze.

306
00:29:58.747 --> 00:30:02.646
Stroke up.

307
00:30:04.539 --> 00:30:08.511
And pull.

308
00:30:08.928 --> 00:30:10.745
I love this.

309
00:30:11.161 --> 00:30:13.204
It's coming.
I can feel it.

310
00:30:13.734 --> 00:30:16.194
A little strong?
A little faster?

311
00:30:16.877 --> 00:30:18.125
It's coming!

312
00:30:18.706 --> 00:30:20.027
Milky white, hot.

313
00:30:22.895 --> 00:30:25.920
Please! Yesona,
let's do it!

314
00:30:43.357 --> 00:30:47.368
Dioneo. Just what do
you think you're doing with that cow?

315
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.943
"Yesona, let's do it!"

316
00:30:52.706 --> 00:30:54.121
Disgusting.
Disgusting.

317
00:30:54.635 --> 00:30:57.094
-I told you, we was there for the milk.
-There's the maid.

318
00:30:57.331 --> 00:30:58.804
Those should not touch!
Remember?

319
00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:03.513
That include beasts and barns,
especially ones with tits and hairy armpits.

320
00:31:03.877 --> 00:31:07.300
Piss off, it's over! You'll never have
sex with me as long as you live!

321
00:31:10.478 --> 00:31:13.882
<i>Sometime later, I heard that the
cow was emotionally disturbed...</i>

322
00:31:13.917 --> 00:31:16.470
<i>by these events, and
never gave milk again.</i>

323
00:31:16.505 --> 00:31:18.401
<i>Poor cow.</i>

324
00:31:23.102 --> 00:31:25.863
It's a sin what you just said.
And the other two.

325
00:31:25.898 --> 00:31:27.174
Yes, you're right.

326
00:31:28.185 --> 00:31:30.108
It's a sin.
A delicious sin.

327
00:31:30.143 --> 00:31:32.562
The four of you in one day!
You should be ashamed.

328
00:31:32.597 --> 00:31:34.189
I think you're jealous.

329
00:31:34.672 --> 00:31:35.615
Huh.

330
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.935
I hope you drown.

331
00:33:15.654 --> 00:33:19.211
Get him, now!

332
00:33:59.015 --> 00:34:00.453
Andreuccio.

333
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:34.697
What was that?

334
00:34:34.998 --> 00:34:36.110
See that?

335
00:34:36.938 --> 00:34:39.589
It's fantastic.
I want that!

336
00:34:40.269 --> 00:34:41.709
Get me that!

337
00:34:52.201 --> 00:34:54.622
Up your ass!

338
00:34:58.491 --> 00:35:00.008
Are you leaving, Father?

339
00:35:00.243 --> 00:35:02.507
In the church...
Gerbino,

340
00:35:03.287 --> 00:35:04.619
he was afraid of me,
wasn't he?

341
00:35:04.654 --> 00:35:07.497
He's afraid of the cross
you wear around your neck.

342
00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:11.109
Allow me to make a
small observation.

343
00:35:11.444 --> 00:35:13.547
All this talk
of virginity.

344
00:35:14.629 --> 00:35:15.398
Yes?

345
00:35:16.779 --> 00:35:19.133
A kissed mouth doesn't
lose its freshness.

346
00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:22.945
Like the moon,
it rises anew again.

347
00:35:24.803 --> 00:35:28.510
-Very poetic I'm sure.
-Just an observation.

348
00:35:28.545 --> 00:35:30.646
It wasn't me
that said it.

349
00:35:31.086 --> 00:35:32.257
What about
the wedding?

350
00:35:32.292 --> 00:35:33.595
I'll be there.

351
00:35:35.149 --> 00:35:37.936
<i>But first I had to make
a pilgrimage of my own.</i>

352
00:35:54.711 --> 00:35:56.981
Yesona.

353
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.384
Yesona!

354
00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:13.259
Yesona, I'm here.

355
00:36:15.757 --> 00:36:19.391
I love you,
my dear.

356
00:36:20.073 --> 00:36:22.495
Yesona, let's take this
ride into the sunset.

357
00:36:24.577 --> 00:36:26.961
You filthy disgusting
beast!

358
00:38:31.085 --> 00:38:35.813
Every day I see you...
I am drawn to you.

359
00:38:38.879 --> 00:38:43.910
Every night I sleep...
I am with you.

360
00:38:55.956 --> 00:38:57.923
Everyday...

361
00:39:03.449 --> 00:39:05.418
Every night.

362
00:39:49.256 --> 00:39:53.161
I think it's farted up with you,
Filomena, that's the truth of it.

363
00:39:54.089 --> 00:39:57.960
Well, when it comes to farting,
Uncle Bruno, you should know.

364
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:01.180
Dioneo...

365
00:40:05.281 --> 00:40:06.659
Dioneo!

366
00:40:15.133 --> 00:40:16.952
Stop this sulking!

367
00:40:17.934 --> 00:40:19.222
I'm not sulking.

368
00:40:21.265 --> 00:40:26.524
Please, Dioneo.
Look at me.

369
00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:28.949
Look at me.

370
00:40:31.599 --> 00:40:34.135
I didn't mean to call
you a filthy beast.

371
00:40:35.282 --> 00:40:38.304
A sweetie pear.
Little honey cucumber.

372
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:42.807
Please, I'm not a child,
or a cucumber.

373
00:40:44.093 --> 00:40:48.006
But I love you.
I love you, cucumber.

374
00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.659
-I love you.
-It was only a dream.

375
00:40:51.944 --> 00:40:54.215
I would never be unfaithful
to you, you know that.

376
00:40:55.427 --> 00:41:01.518
It's like being licked by a dog
when you do that, it really is.

377
00:41:03.449 --> 00:41:08.482
Hey, listen to me.
I love you and I forgive you.

378
00:41:10.978 --> 00:41:14.612
There, look. You're forgiven
with a proper kiss.

379
00:41:18.448 --> 00:41:20.074
And another.

380
00:41:24.668 --> 00:41:26.031
And another.

381
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.996
And another.

382
00:41:40.468 --> 00:41:41.981
Dioneo.

383
00:41:42.324 --> 00:41:43.911
Stop this now.

384
00:41:44.368 --> 00:41:45.653
Me?

385
00:41:46.976 --> 00:41:50.419
Dio, kiss me.

386
00:41:51.216 --> 00:41:52.845
Kiss me.

387
00:41:55.502 --> 00:41:58.908
My God.
What's that?

388
00:42:01.407 --> 00:42:03.185
What do you
think it is?

389
00:42:07.461 --> 00:42:11.321
When we're married.
Soon. You'll see.

390
00:42:11.964 --> 00:42:14.347
What a treasure I
have for you.

391
00:42:17.641 --> 00:42:20.402
Give me Give me..
Give me the treasure!

392
00:42:21.351 --> 00:42:23.923
Give me the treasure!
Please.

393
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:31.453
What's happening? Dioneo!
What's going on?

394
00:42:36.609 --> 00:42:38.728
My God!
What happened?

395
00:42:39.563 --> 00:42:41.227
Nothing. Nothing.

396
00:42:42.174 --> 00:42:45.029
It may be nothing to you,
Dioneo Dugalante,

397
00:42:45.177 --> 00:42:47.260
but it's a disgrace and
humiliation to me!

398
00:42:48.077 --> 00:42:50.309
One kiss and look
what you've done!

399
00:42:51.747 --> 00:42:54.221
You had your hand...
right on my root.

400
00:42:55.081 --> 00:42:57.771
I did nothing of the sort.
That's the trouble with you.

401
00:42:58.376 --> 00:42:59.464
You just don't know
when to stop.

402
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:01.677
Hello, love.

403
00:43:03.646 --> 00:43:05.841
Good show.

404
00:43:27.065 --> 00:43:29.827
This way please.

405
00:43:30.772 --> 00:43:32.022
Melissa!

406
00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:35.300
I am Alessandro Felice,

407
00:43:35.928 --> 00:43:36.986
and I am your host.

408
00:43:37.433 --> 00:43:38.317
Welcome.

409
00:43:39.053 --> 00:43:41.485
You're not our host and
we are not your guests.

410
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.009
We are your prisoners.

411
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:51.351
Show us your body. So beautiful.
The world is waiting for girls like you.

412
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:53.943
Have you travelled?

413
00:43:56.404 --> 00:43:57.071
I've been to Sienna.

414
00:43:57.748 --> 00:43:59.260
Sienna?

415
00:44:03.236 --> 00:44:06.643
Then you must come with me
to Tunisia. You'll like it there.

416
00:44:08.268 --> 00:44:10.691
-Where is Tunisia?
-Africa.

417
00:44:12.746 --> 00:44:15.910
-Why are you going to Africa?
-To sell slaves,

418
00:44:16.709 --> 00:44:19.205
and to work,
of course.

419
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.970
What do you mean, work?

420
00:44:23.346 --> 00:44:25.078
It's easy.
It's relaxing work.

421
00:44:26.441 --> 00:44:28.183
You'll will spend most of
the time on your back.

422
00:44:28.798 --> 00:44:31.446
-Over my dead body.
-That can be always be arranged.

423
00:44:35.805 --> 00:44:38.833
My god... he wants to...?

424
00:44:40.272 --> 00:44:42.430
That is what he
means, isn't it?

425
00:44:43.678 --> 00:44:45.117
What are we
gonna do?

426
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.204
Did you see the
way he looked at us?

427
00:44:52.059 --> 00:44:55.085
He's handsome.
He's sexy.

428
00:44:56.599 --> 00:44:58.188
What do you mean?

429
00:44:59.211 --> 00:45:02.389
Look, if you want to get out of here alive,
we just have to take control,

430
00:45:02.424 --> 00:45:05.190
lead these dickheads
by the nose.

431
00:45:32.791 --> 00:45:37.445
This is what is commonly known...
as a Show Palace.

432
00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:42.479
Sit down and
be a good boy.

433
00:45:46.878 --> 00:45:47.832
Put these on.

434
00:45:50.529 --> 00:45:51.145
You're next.

435
00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:59.328
I will not... I will not...
relinquish...

436
00:45:59.363 --> 00:46:03.641
my precious...precious...
jewel.

437
00:46:05.018 --> 00:46:11.529
Not until my Diana...
meets my Apollo...

438
00:46:12.927 --> 00:46:17.347
and the goddess
Venus... carries me...

439
00:46:18.255 --> 00:46:20.356
oh, please carry me...

440
00:46:21.141 --> 00:46:24.735
to the threshold...
of my Jupiter.

441
00:46:26.402 --> 00:46:28.143
Who are these guys?

442
00:46:28.825 --> 00:46:30.944
Gods... like you...

443
00:46:35.108 --> 00:46:39.270
I have waited...
longing...

444
00:46:39.305 --> 00:46:44.430
but still, my Jupiter
has not come.

445
00:46:46.056 --> 00:46:48.252
I pray for him to come me.

446
00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:51.790
Yearn for him to come.

447
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:58.070
You, my delicious.

448
00:46:58.867 --> 00:47:01.590
You are my Jupiter.

449
00:47:14.204 --> 00:47:18.783
Filomena, please don't let them
take me away. I need to wee!

450
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:20.713
Oh shut up,
you stupid fart!

451
00:47:21.451 --> 00:47:22.040
You have to hold on!

452
00:47:24.802 --> 00:47:26.845
-What happened?
-It was boring.

453
00:47:27.441 --> 00:47:28.527
All he wanted to
do was look.

454
00:47:28.913 --> 00:47:31.560
Made me dance around the pole
without my knickers and that was it.

455
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.029
Where'd you get that?

456
00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.386
-I'm next.
-Follow me, do actually as I do. Got it?

457
00:47:44.416 --> 00:47:45.739
Gentlemen.

458
00:47:46.587 --> 00:47:48.140
Gentlemen!

459
00:47:48.293 --> 00:47:50.868
Your captain has given us to you,
for your delight.

460
00:47:51.577 --> 00:47:52.505
For your delight!

461
00:47:53.377 --> 00:47:53.803
Hurray!

462
00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.875
This is the lovely
Filomena.

463
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.173
A beauty,
I'll think you'll agree.

464
00:48:03.667 --> 00:48:06.506
Have you ever seen
such glorious breasts?

465
00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:08.809
Show them.

466
00:48:13.695 --> 00:48:14.418
-They like it!

467
00:48:14.419 --> 00:48:16.949
-Gentlemen, let's hear
it for Filomena's breasts.

468
00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.876
Now, every person knows that
there is one thing that matters,

469
00:48:25.049 --> 00:48:27.067
the one who gets to go first...

470
00:48:27.068 --> 00:48:28.909
and who goes last.

471
00:48:29.592 --> 00:48:31.802
Who's the biggest
tomcat in town?

472
00:48:32.308 --> 00:48:35.713
Me, Me, Me, Me!

473
00:48:36.322 --> 00:48:39.321
There is only one way to do it.
Off. Get them off.

474
00:48:40.123 --> 00:48:41.937
Let's get a look
at the tackle.

475
00:48:42.672 --> 00:48:45.571
Come along. Come along,
in a line, in a line.

476
00:48:45.758 --> 00:48:48.445
All boys together.
Don't be shy.

477
00:48:48.548 --> 00:48:52.761
On the count to three, you big butch bandits,
drop those loons.

478
00:48:53.216 --> 00:48:54.133
One!

479
00:48:55.466 --> 00:48:56.374
Two!

480
00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.025
Three!

481
00:49:01.296 --> 00:49:03.452
Wonderful...
magnificent.

482
00:49:04.135 --> 00:49:07.050
Behold... manhood
in all its glory.

483
00:49:07.731 --> 00:49:09.660
My God, I never seen
one before!

484
00:49:09.695 --> 00:49:14.240
-Now, there's a whole army of them!
-Let's take a closer look.

485
00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:20.598
Order, please, order.
You! Stand up straight!

486
00:49:21.052 --> 00:49:22.303
Let me see.

487
00:49:22.491 --> 00:49:26.351
I think you should swap
places with him.

488
00:49:29.642 --> 00:49:32.028
And... you with him.

489
00:49:33.935 --> 00:49:35.261
Better.

490
00:49:37.683 --> 00:49:39.273
Where is it?

491
00:49:41.015 --> 00:49:43.322
Oh, there is it.

492
00:49:44.307 --> 00:49:45.509
That's very small...

493
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:47.144
and shrively.

494
00:49:50.931 --> 00:49:53.464
-I hope they're not all like that?
-Thanks very much.

495
00:49:54.034 --> 00:49:56.304
Looks like the end,
don't you think, Melissa?

496
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:59.862
Off you go,
chop chop.

497
00:50:01.723 --> 00:50:03.687
Wonderful display,
well done everyone.

498
00:50:04.217 --> 00:50:04.724
Now this is it.

499
00:50:05.372 --> 00:50:06.936
The moment you've
all been waiting for.

500
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:10.462
Who...
goes first?

501
00:50:11.255 --> 00:50:14.018
We do, start with the biggest
and work your way down.

502
00:50:14.473 --> 00:50:17.275
No!. The smallest... start small
and work your way up.

503
00:50:18.487 --> 00:50:21.325
We both start in the middle,
and work our way to the end.

504
00:50:23.028 --> 00:50:26.510
-I'm the smallest, I go first.
-You want first, then last?

505
00:50:26.966 --> 00:50:28.796
Watch what you
say, big knob!

506
00:50:28.988 --> 00:50:31.939
-You're asking for a thump.
-Try this for size.

507
00:50:33.717 --> 00:50:35.987
Right, that's it.

508
00:50:44.289 --> 00:50:45.578
Gino!

509
00:50:49.383 --> 00:50:53.408
Me next. Come on Gino,
Come one. Hurry up!

510
00:50:55.142 --> 00:50:56.726
Having fun?

511
00:50:57.874 --> 00:51:00.957
What does it you said,
"over your dead body?"

512
00:51:04.172 --> 00:51:05.952
Naughty man.

513
00:51:20.903 --> 00:51:23.629
<i>Now comes the news
she didn't want to hear. </i>

514
00:51:24.121 --> 00:51:26.051
<i>The Count had
arrived in Florence.</i>

515
00:51:29.497 --> 00:51:32.181
<i>Now Pampinea
has a dilemma.</i>

516
00:51:32.216 --> 00:51:36.155
<i>How does she feel about leaving
Lorenzo alone with all those nuns?</i>

517
00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:38.085
How do you know this?

518
00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.510
I heard him,
singing in the garden.

519
00:51:41.872 --> 00:51:43.918
-You're certain?
-Very.

520
00:51:50.009 --> 00:51:51.572
He has a beautiful voice.

521
00:51:53.238 --> 00:51:54.380
It'd just be
hard to resist.

522
00:51:56.898 --> 00:51:59.775
Goodbye...
and thank you.

523
00:52:18.011 --> 00:52:23.838
The butcher's here. He brought a knife.
A very sharp knife.

524
00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:27.790
His ready to cut off your...

525
00:52:27.825 --> 00:52:30.098
Please!

526
00:52:37.629 --> 00:52:39.255
A miracle!

527
00:52:40.165 --> 00:52:42.133
I can speak!

528
00:52:44.135 --> 00:52:45.135
Get out!

529
00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.225
Your pants.

530
00:53:35.297 --> 00:53:36.948
Are you human?

531
00:53:37.894 --> 00:53:40.401
No, I'm the spirit
of this pool.

532
00:53:41.128 --> 00:53:42.772
An enchantress.

533
00:53:43.009 --> 00:53:44.476
I thought that much.

534
00:53:45.425 --> 00:53:49.213
And... am I now
under your spell?

535
00:53:49.971 --> 00:53:52.691
Yes. Now that you
have drunk the water.

536
00:53:53.412 --> 00:53:54.636
You're under my spell.

537
00:53:55.675 --> 00:53:56.998
Where did you
come from?

538
00:53:58.012 --> 00:54:00.249
Before you became...
an enchantress.

539
00:54:00.555 --> 00:54:01.447
Florence.

540
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:03.811
Where are you
travelling to?

541
00:54:04.049 --> 00:54:05.523
To a wedding.

542
00:54:09.099 --> 00:54:12.945
-Are you the bride?
-If I were the bride...

543
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:17.485
on my way to be married...
would you be the groom?

544
00:54:18.963 --> 00:54:22.369
Well, like you, I'm also travelling
to a wedding, but if...

545
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:23.167
by chance...

546
00:54:24.747 --> 00:54:26.515
you were to tell me
that your name...

547
00:54:26.699 --> 00:54:28.679
is Pampinea Anastasi then...

548
00:54:28.814 --> 00:54:30.235
my life would
be complete.

549
00:54:30.576 --> 00:54:32.348
Because you are,
without question...

550
00:54:33.098 --> 00:54:36.648
the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

551
00:54:37.463 --> 00:54:41.558
If I'm Pampinea Anastasi,
then you must be...

552
00:54:41.719 --> 00:54:44.250
Dmitry Vyacheslav
Alexandrovich Dzerzhinsky,

553
00:54:44.377 --> 00:54:49.488
first son of Alexander
Pyotr Abramovich Dzerzhinsky,

554
00:54:49.855 --> 00:54:52.139
from the Kingdom of
Novgorod and you...

555
00:54:54.505 --> 00:54:58.291
you are Pampinea Anastasi, soon to
be my bride. Is this not true?

556
00:54:59.388 --> 00:55:01.755
No. I'm an
enchantress.

557
00:55:02.871 --> 00:55:06.255
And you have
answered my call,

558
00:55:06.796 --> 00:55:08.090
at that special
moment....

559
00:55:08.276 --> 00:55:10.318
when a woman must
make her gift

560
00:55:11.471 --> 00:55:13.037
of her precious
jewel.

561
00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:16.467
A treasure all women
hold dear...

562
00:55:16.964 --> 00:55:19.482
the greatest gift a woman
can bestow to a man,

563
00:55:21.224 --> 00:55:23.213
but sometimes you
can't wait.

564
00:55:26.193 --> 00:55:28.651
You must tell no one
of our meeting.

565
00:55:45.765 --> 00:55:47.450
<i>Having, succeeding
getting him chucked out,</i>

566
00:55:48.015 --> 00:55:50.358
<i>Pampinea back tracked
past the convent...</i>

567
00:55:50.822 --> 00:55:54.622
<i>just to be certain the nuns weren't
getting what she fancied for herself.</i>

568
00:56:00.489 --> 00:56:02.313
Lorenzo De Lamberti.

569
00:56:03.184 --> 00:56:05.040
Pampinea Anastasi.

570
00:56:05.918 --> 00:56:06.742
What are you doing here?

571
00:56:07.218 --> 00:56:08.031
You know, just...

572
00:56:08.641 --> 00:56:10.044
enjoying the day.

573
00:56:11.598 --> 00:56:12.426
I've been working
in the garden,

574
00:56:12.897 --> 00:56:13.867
escaping the
city life.

575
00:56:14.056 --> 00:56:15.270
A gardener?

576
00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:18.564
I have a strong
affinity with nature.

577
00:56:18.599 --> 00:56:19.813
Oh.

578
00:56:20.748 --> 00:56:25.034
Well good, we'll see you then.
Maybe. Minghino.

579
00:56:26.595 --> 00:56:28.111
No, wait, wait, wait.

580
00:56:29.967 --> 00:56:32.652
-Where're you going?
-On my way to be married.

581
00:56:33.562 --> 00:56:35.697
Ah, I heard about that.

582
00:56:36.263 --> 00:56:38.683
Some short, fat Russian
from Novgorod?

583
00:56:39.658 --> 00:56:43.374
I hear you're very popular...
very much in demand.

584
00:56:44.243 --> 00:56:45.663
You mean
Gerbino De la Ratta?

585
00:56:46.618 --> 00:56:47.383
He's a turd.

586
00:56:48.483 --> 00:56:51.134
I hear you're wanted for your debt.
Minghino.

587
00:56:53.033 --> 00:56:55.608
Enjoy your affinity
with nature.

588
00:56:57.199 --> 00:56:58.978
Perhaps I can
come with you and, uh...

589
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:03.181
to be your escort.

590
00:57:04.618 --> 00:57:07.229
To deliver you safely
into the arms of your fat Russian.

591
00:57:10.032 --> 00:57:12.455
<i>Like all good pilgrims,
I've followed the path.</i>

592
00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:14.643
<i>I had arrived...</i>

593
00:57:15.928 --> 00:57:16.646
<i>Heaven.</i>

594
00:57:29.713 --> 00:57:32.515
<i>They say the Mother
Superior at this convent...</i>

595
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:35.655
<i>is a woman of unparalleled
lust and randiness.</i>

596
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:38.647
-Who's there?
-I'm a Holy Father...

597
00:57:38.682 --> 00:57:42.107
in search for a place of
contemplation and prayer.

598
00:57:47.262 --> 00:57:50.063
I'll take you to
the Holy Mother.

599
00:57:50.098 --> 00:57:54.264
-Father. Have you any skills?
-Such as?

600
00:57:54.299 --> 00:57:59.566
-Gardening, perhaps.
-Gardening? A little.

601
00:57:59.601 --> 00:58:00.212
Good.

602
00:58:01.393 --> 00:58:04.837
All this silence you see upon,
it's almost as if we were....

603
00:58:05.482 --> 00:58:06.337
deaf and dumb.

604
00:58:06.635 --> 00:58:11.709
We may see many things, but we
speak nothing of them in here.

605
00:58:12.225 --> 00:58:13.366
Understand?

606
00:58:18.572 --> 00:58:20.785
Silence...
Deaf and dumb.

607
00:58:22.463 --> 00:58:25.499
And gardening,
not quite I have in mind.

608
00:58:33.905 --> 00:58:36.967
Would you care...
for a bath?

609
00:58:37.877 --> 00:58:42.004
<i>A bath?
I was in.</i>

610
00:59:13.182 --> 00:59:16.152
Perfect place
for a wedding.

611
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:27.948
Nobody's here yet,
we're the first.

612
00:59:31.176 --> 00:59:32.237
Lorenzo!

613
00:59:36.399 --> 00:59:37.999
Wait...
Lorenzo.

614
00:59:40.949 --> 00:59:43.524
You could stay...
just a little longer.

615
00:59:53.894 --> 00:59:57.480
Blindfolded?
Is that really true?

616
00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.064
You were blindfolded
when you kissed her?

617
01:00:00.519 --> 01:00:01.994
When she kissed me.

618
01:00:04.457 --> 01:00:06.725
You'll soon forget her,
that's what I think.

619
01:00:07.462 --> 01:00:08.718
You'll forget her
and the kiss.

620
01:00:10.217 --> 01:00:13.054
You, Lorenzo Lamberti...
to tell the truth and all.

621
01:00:14.191 --> 01:00:16.197
You don't have
to believe me.

622
01:00:17.272 --> 01:00:19.959
How can you be in love with
a woman you've never seen?

623
01:00:21.095 --> 01:00:23.585
Simple.
It was the kiss.

624
01:00:25.813 --> 01:00:27.266
Everything was in
that one kiss.

625
01:00:30.142 --> 01:00:31.848
How'll you find her?

626
01:00:32.756 --> 01:00:35.546
This woman you've never seen,
locked behind convent doors?

627
01:00:39.149 --> 01:00:41.117
I don't know.

628
01:00:42.896 --> 01:00:44.562
I don't know,
perhaps you're right.

629
01:00:44.597 --> 01:00:47.061
I mean, they're not gonna let me
in that convent, that's for sure.

630
01:00:51.575 --> 01:00:54.576
I think it's best you
forget her, Lorenzo.

631
01:00:57.505 --> 01:00:58.655
No, I don't think I can forget her.

632
01:01:15.151 --> 01:01:16.894
What if you
found her?

633
01:01:16.929 --> 01:01:21.585
What if you found her, kissed her,
and your dream dies?

634
01:01:22.568 --> 01:01:23.651
How will you feel?

635
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.894
It's not to dream.

636
01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.272
Lorenzo, your memory of the precious
kiss will fade, and temptation will reign.

637
01:01:29.983 --> 01:01:30.725
You'll see.

638
01:01:31.649 --> 01:01:34.417
Even if I have to kiss
you myself to prove it.

639
01:01:34.452 --> 01:01:36.613
-Sounds like a challenge?
-Maybe it is.

640
01:01:37.357 --> 01:01:40.322
You were always the girl
every boy wanted to kiss.

641
01:01:40.966 --> 01:01:41.801
But?

642
01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:46.346
But... you were
always too...

643
01:01:47.325 --> 01:01:48.538
Too what?

644
01:01:51.792 --> 01:01:54.708
Too good,
clever, too...

645
01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:59.023
too beautiful.

646
01:02:00.537 --> 01:02:02.886
Too everything,
always out of reach.

647
01:02:05.998 --> 01:02:07.700
Why don't you kiss
me now, Lorenzo?

648
01:02:08.777 --> 01:02:11.085
See if I can make
you better.

649
01:02:14.228 --> 01:02:17.632
You mean for all the times that I wanted
to kiss you, but never could?

650
01:02:21.017 --> 01:02:24.234
For all those times,
and more.

651
01:02:29.851 --> 01:02:31.555
Close your eyes.

652
01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:42.557
Gerbino, I know it.

653
01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.441
It's him!

654
01:02:46.074 --> 01:02:48.123
Run Lorenzo. Please,
he'll kill you for sure.

655
01:02:49.815 --> 01:02:51.255
Run, Run!

656
01:02:52.389 --> 01:02:55.275
De la Ratta!
You shit.

657
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:58.189
We could smell
you coming.

658
01:02:59.508 --> 01:03:00.235
Lorenzo!

659
01:03:00.878 --> 01:03:03.564
Come on! You want
to kill me? Do it!

660
01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:05.079
Come on!

661
01:03:10.909 --> 01:03:12.047
Come on.

662
01:03:14.547 --> 01:03:15.683
Give me a sword!

663
01:03:17.868 --> 01:03:20.000
Give me a stick and I'll cut you!

664
01:03:26.843 --> 01:03:29.378
Gerbino De la Ratta!
Stop!

665
01:03:31.279 --> 01:03:33.099
Gerbino, leave him!

666
01:03:34.206 --> 01:03:35.946
Leave him!

667
01:03:40.564 --> 01:03:42.350
I will not marry you.
Never!

668
01:03:43.045 --> 01:03:43.808
Not if you kill him!

669
01:03:46.517 --> 01:03:47.576
Marry him?

670
01:03:50.604 --> 01:03:51.981
Is that what
this is about?

671
01:03:52.684 --> 01:03:53.664
You marrying him?

672
01:04:20.884 --> 01:04:22.814
Make a mistake,
you're a dead man.

673
01:04:23.761 --> 01:04:27.320
Kill me today, you'll still
be an ugly shit tomorrow.

674
01:04:54.812 --> 01:04:56.518
He's in trouble,
Pampinea.

675
01:04:57.388 --> 01:04:58.828
A lot of trouble.

676
01:04:59.194 --> 01:05:00.892
What kind of trouble?

677
01:05:01.543 --> 01:05:02.226
Theft.

678
01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:04.770
Murder.

679
01:05:06.248 --> 01:05:09.686
I can believe what you say,
you're not first say it.

680
01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:11.164
But he's only a boy.

681
01:05:13.626 --> 01:05:15.028
Please.

682
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.906
Please.

683
01:05:20.822 --> 01:05:21.476
What?

684
01:05:22.805 --> 01:05:25.075
Don't lean over.

685
01:05:33.735 --> 01:05:36.196
What are you doing?
Please.

686
01:05:38.012 --> 01:05:39.377
Listen.

687
01:05:47.664 --> 01:05:51.787
-Just... come down.
-You're afraid of heights, aren't you?

688
01:05:53.002 --> 01:05:53.875
No.

689
01:05:56.335 --> 01:05:58.490
Just don't want
you to fall in.

690
01:05:59.101 --> 01:05:59.970
How can I fall?

691
01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:02.707
I've been playing on this
well since I was a child.

692
01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:03.324
Get down!

693
01:06:07.455 --> 01:06:10.870
Release Lorenzo...
and you can send for the priest.

694
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:12.749
Now?

695
01:06:14.247 --> 01:06:15.470
You'll marry me now?

696
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:19.120
Yes.

697
01:06:20.293 --> 01:06:22.938
But if I marry you,
and you don't release him,

698
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:25.203
and you have blood
on your hands...

699
01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:27.684
then you'll spend the rest
of your life in a cold bed.

700
01:06:27.712 --> 01:06:28.905
Do you understand?

701
01:06:29.758 --> 01:06:31.066
I'll give you nothing of
what I have to give.

702
01:06:34.642 --> 01:06:36.057
You have my word.

703
01:06:37.383 --> 01:06:38.744
I'll send for a priest.

704
01:06:40.522 --> 01:06:42.417
How the hell do you find
a priest just like that?

705
01:06:43.402 --> 01:06:45.447
He'll have our balls on
the block if we don't.

706
01:06:47.989 --> 01:06:50.654
-Hey, You!
-What?

707
01:06:50.689 --> 01:06:53.076
Father.
Where're you going?

708
01:06:53.111 --> 01:06:55.462
To Pampinea's father's house...

709
01:06:56.712 --> 01:06:57.946
to the wedding?

710
01:06:59.232 --> 01:07:02.600
How did you know we wanted a priest
when we've just been sent to get one?

711
01:07:03.283 --> 01:07:04.947
The word of God
travels fast.

712
01:07:05.182 --> 01:07:07.365
Hey, don't I know you?

713
01:07:08.013 --> 01:07:09.412
Your face is
very familiar.

714
01:07:10.294 --> 01:07:13.018
It's the clothes,
all priests looks the same.

715
01:07:27.094 --> 01:07:29.593
You must go. Leave before
he changes his mind.

716
01:07:30.151 --> 01:07:31.664
Are you really
going to marry him?

717
01:07:32.139 --> 01:07:33.144
Not your concern.

718
01:07:35.279 --> 01:07:36.454
The priest's here.

719
01:07:37.891 --> 01:07:39.104
Leave while you can.

720
01:07:46.584 --> 01:07:48.566
He wants hear our confessions
before the wedding.

721
01:07:49.739 --> 01:07:50.762
I'll go first.

722
01:07:58.785 --> 01:08:00.199
I'm sorry, just to be clear.

723
01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.572
How many potential
husbands you have right now?

724
01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:04.996
-Three.
-And which one do you want?

725
01:08:05.412 --> 01:08:06.403
Lorenzo!

726
01:08:06.704 --> 01:08:08.487
I love only Lorenzo.

727
01:08:08.893 --> 01:08:10.910
But you haven't met the Count,
the one you promised to marry.

728
01:08:11.046 --> 01:08:12.003
You could fall in
love with him.

729
01:08:12.238 --> 01:08:15.594
-No, I love only Lorenzo.
-Does he love you?

730
01:08:15.746 --> 01:08:19.757
Yes. No. I mean he loves me but
he just doesn't know it yet.

731
01:08:20.704 --> 01:08:23.052
It's not easy
being a priest.

732
01:08:25.966 --> 01:08:27.971
Please delay as
long as you can.

733
01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:03.173
and I realized that...

734
01:09:03.467 --> 01:09:07.353
stealing other people's money was far
easier than working for my own.

735
01:09:07.706 --> 01:09:11.688
All those killings?
How many people?

736
01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:20.698
-I can't remember.
-That's quite a list.

737
01:09:21.909 --> 01:09:23.346
Not to mention what you
did to your father.

738
01:09:31.913 --> 01:09:33.352
Do I know you?

739
01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.931
Your face is familiar,
I'm sure I know you.

740
01:09:39.068 --> 01:09:41.881
It's the clothes.
All priests looks the same.

741
01:09:50.171 --> 01:09:51.141
To absolve yourself...

742
01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:55.411
from these terrible sins and
to have any hope for an eternal salvation.

743
01:09:55.968 --> 01:09:58.733
you must abstain from all sexual
thoughts and all sexual deeds..

744
01:09:59.604 --> 01:10:01.268
for a period of 30 days.

745
01:10:03.315 --> 01:10:05.083
But I'm just about to be married!

746
01:10:05.084 --> 01:10:07.172
How can I abstain
from sex for 30 days?

747
01:10:07.966 --> 01:10:10.239
That's... mean!

748
01:10:10.892 --> 01:10:12.520
And stupid.

749
01:10:12.755 --> 01:10:16.509
Well of course, if you
do something really stupid...

750
01:10:16.772 --> 01:10:19.333
then you must expect to suffer so we
can remain stupid in return...

751
01:10:19.575 --> 01:10:23.192
just to show you how stupid
you were in the first place.

752
01:10:23.227 --> 01:10:25.614
It's called a penance.

753
01:10:25.649 --> 01:10:31.746
That's... really,
really stupid.

754
01:10:33.298 --> 01:10:36.324
God works in
mysterious ways.

755
01:10:38.219 --> 01:10:40.830
<i>Well, I had him by the nuts...
that's for sure.</i>

756
01:10:41.359 --> 01:10:44.920
<i>But how long could I squeeze,
before he squeezes mine?</i>

757
01:10:48.636 --> 01:10:51.414
You know Gerbino sent us
along to kill you, don't you?

758
01:10:52.135 --> 01:10:53.459
I kind of guessed that.

759
01:10:54.444 --> 01:10:56.413
Dirty business, killing.

760
01:10:56.448 --> 01:10:59.742
-I'd rather be a gardener.
-I know just the place.

761
01:10:59.777 --> 01:11:03.866
Listen.
We could let you go.

762
01:11:03.901 --> 01:11:06.484
But you must
promise not to tell.

763
01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:08.195
Really?

764
01:11:14.784 --> 01:11:17.624
-I promise.
-Good.

765
01:11:24.094 --> 01:11:25.647
Ow! God that hurts!

766
01:11:27.538 --> 01:11:29.469
That really, really hurts.

767
01:11:31.059 --> 01:11:34.859
Is this the road to the villa of
Pampinea Anastasi?

768
01:11:35.543 --> 01:11:37.548
-It's that way.
-I thank you.

769
01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:40.159
Who are you?

770
01:11:40.841 --> 01:11:45.668
I am Count Dmitry Vyacheslav
Alexandrovich Dzerzhinsky...!

771
01:11:46.691 --> 01:11:48.773
Ah!
The short fat Russian

772
01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.609
Witness, all of you.

773
01:12:10.102 --> 01:12:12.977
You are Gerbino De la Ratta?

774
01:12:14.301 --> 01:12:14.961
You know who I am.

775
01:12:15.314 --> 01:12:16.504
Please don't be difficult.

776
01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:19.412
How can I marry you if you
don't answer the question?

777
01:12:21.988 --> 01:12:23.994
Are you Gerbino De la Ratta?

778
01:12:25.204 --> 01:12:26.265
I am.

779
01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:31.299
-You are Pampinea Anastasi?
-I am, Father.

780
01:12:32.018 --> 01:12:34.227
And when did you both last
take confession? Pampinea?

781
01:12:36.021 --> 01:12:37.839
I've taken confession on
this day, Father.

782
01:12:38.227 --> 01:12:40.460
-Did you confess all your sins?
-I did, Father.

783
01:12:42.313 --> 01:12:43.354
Gerbino De la Ratta.

784
01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.086
When did you last
take confession?

785
01:12:45.798 --> 01:12:48.255
-You know when I last took confession.
-Bad answer.

786
01:12:48.627 --> 01:12:52.494
"I have taken confession
on this day, Father."

787
01:12:54.618 --> 01:12:57.428
-I have taken confession on this day.
-Father.

788
01:12:58.827 --> 01:13:00.227
Father.

789
01:13:01.212 --> 01:13:05.039
Then do you both come to me,
pure in body and soul. Answer I do.

790
01:13:05.223 --> 01:13:07.647
- I do.
- I do.

791
01:13:08.569 --> 01:13:10.122
- Have you bathed?
- What?!

792
01:13:10.377 --> 01:13:11.301
Pampinea?

793
01:13:11.871 --> 01:13:14.684
I have bathed on this day of days
which is my marriage day.

794
01:13:15.499 --> 01:13:19.824
Witness all of you, this woman comes
to us pure, in both body and soul.

795
01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:21.958
Gerbino De la Ratta.

796
01:13:22.290 --> 01:13:25.344
Have you bathed on this day
of days, that is your wedding day?

797
01:13:25.413 --> 01:13:28.027
- Yes.
- When did you bathe?

798
01:13:28.518 --> 01:13:31.014
- I just told you I bathed!
- When exactly, when did you last take a bath?

799
01:13:31.233 --> 01:13:32.578
I have bathed!

800
01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:35.045
Thoroughly? All the bits
and pieces, downstairs....

801
01:13:35.124 --> 01:13:37.333
-In between your legs?
-What?

802
01:13:37.921 --> 01:13:39.602
Show me your hands.

803
01:13:40.739 --> 01:13:43.994
-You got dirt under your nails.
-Where?

804
01:13:44.525 --> 01:13:47.551
There. I cannot marry you if
you have dirty fingernails.

805
01:13:48.613 --> 01:13:51.830
That's ridiculous...
I've never heard anything so ridiculous.

806
01:13:52.282 --> 01:13:54.721
I can hardly say, witness all of you,

807
01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:57.884
this man comes to us pure
in both body and soul,

808
01:13:57.919 --> 01:14:00.800
but with dirty fingernails.
Now can I?

809
01:14:00.835 --> 01:14:02.352
You must wash your hands.

810
01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.673
At the very least.

811
01:14:21.441 --> 01:14:24.143
-There.
-Thank you.

812
01:14:29.818 --> 01:14:31.029
He's only doing his job.

813
01:14:31.064 --> 01:14:32.583
Exactly.

814
01:14:33.907 --> 01:14:37.464
Incidentally, there is a
charge for my services.

815
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:48.293
This is very jolly.

816
01:14:52.493 --> 01:14:54.273
Pour this fine wine...

817
01:15:11.531 --> 01:15:15.239
a little young perhaps, fine,
fresh fruit, with a...

818
01:15:15.407 --> 01:15:18.512
a musty, a
musty hint...

819
01:15:20.101 --> 01:15:24.870
a musty hint of what I can
really only describe as a stale fart...

820
01:15:25.174 --> 01:15:28.050
rather like the combination of
this couple here before me today.

821
01:15:29.547 --> 01:15:31.177
Marry us now,
you bastard!

822
01:15:31.212 --> 01:15:33.940
I declare you man and wife.
There, it's done.

823
01:15:33.975 --> 01:15:37.536
You're married. Relax, enjoy.
Consummate, whatever you want, really.

824
01:15:37.571 --> 01:15:39.164
Hey!

825
01:15:48.702 --> 01:15:51.500
I'm Count Dmitry Vyacheslav
Alexandrovich Dzerzhinsky...

826
01:15:51.535 --> 01:15:55.905
first son of Alexander
Pyotr Abramovich Dzerzhinsky...

827
01:15:55.940 --> 01:16:01.167
from the Kingdom of Novgorod.
I am here to marry Pampinea Anastasi.

828
01:16:01.202 --> 01:16:04.232
I will kill any man who
tries to stop me.

829
01:16:04.267 --> 01:16:07.941
You're too late.
Pampinea Anastasi is already married.

830
01:16:08.276 --> 01:16:09.793
This is my wife.

831
01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:12.782
This is house.
This is my land.

832
01:16:12.817 --> 01:16:15.248
And I advise you to leave while you
still have air to breathe.

833
01:16:15.283 --> 01:16:17.047
This lady may
be your wife,

834
01:16:17.256 --> 01:16:20.113
but I'm sorry to tell you,
she's about to become a widow.

835
01:16:21.476 --> 01:16:22.878
You piece of rat.

836
01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:26.193
You killed four of my men who
were close to my heart.

837
01:16:26.395 --> 01:16:27.493
You stole their lives.

838
01:16:27.694 --> 01:16:29.667
And now you must pay!

839
01:16:39.869 --> 01:16:41.195
Lorenzo!

840
01:16:50.976 --> 01:16:52.453
Run!

841
01:17:16.162 --> 01:17:18.132
-Where did he go?
-I don't know.

842
01:17:19.307 --> 01:17:21.159
-You go that way, I'll go this way.
-Who are you?

843
01:17:21.694 --> 01:17:23.128
Lorenzo Lamberti.

844
01:17:24.303 --> 01:17:27.368
The robber on the road. Yes!
I am Count Dmitry Alexandro...

845
01:17:27.403 --> 01:17:29.222
I know, I know.

846
01:17:30.586 --> 01:17:32.164
First son!

847
01:17:32.965 --> 01:17:35.281
Only son,
nine sisters.

848
01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:43.074
Gerbino De la Ratta.

849
01:18:13.825 --> 01:18:15.565
Get her and bring
her to me.

850
01:18:35.696 --> 01:18:37.399
Kill them and throw
them down to me.

851
01:18:37.566 --> 01:18:38.616
Hello.

852
01:18:39.917 --> 01:18:44.055
Tell me...
Are you ready to die?

853
01:19:04.707 --> 01:19:06.356
How awful.
You dropped your little sword.

854
01:19:07.363 --> 01:19:08.076
Pick it up.

855
01:19:09.307 --> 01:19:10.636
Fight me.

856
01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:13.052
Fight me or I'll kill
you anyway.

857
01:19:13.255 --> 01:19:14.724
Wait.

858
01:19:16.259 --> 01:19:17.752
There's some unfinished business.

859
01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.783
Is that not right,
Gerbino?

860
01:19:22.409 --> 01:19:24.910
You want to kill me?
Why don't you come up here and join me?

861
01:19:24.945 --> 01:19:26.989
I'm sorry my friend.
I've sworn to kill this man.

862
01:19:27.024 --> 01:19:30.284
You kill him before I kill him,
I may have to kill you.

863
01:19:30.519 --> 01:19:33.274
Here, let this decide.

864
01:19:41.329 --> 01:19:43.298
Alright, if you want.

865
01:19:45.056 --> 01:19:46.492
Why not join him.

866
01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.427
I'll fight him.

867
01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:51.212
But don't step in.

868
01:19:54.442 --> 01:19:56.596
I may step in.

869
01:19:58.163 --> 01:19:59.484
I may step out.

870
01:20:01.142 --> 01:20:04.437
I may even decide to have
a little dance with you.

871
01:20:06.099 --> 01:20:07.215
but don't worry my friend.

872
01:20:08.386 --> 01:20:10.824
If he kills you,
I'll kill him, either way,

873
01:20:11.356 --> 01:20:12.260
you're going to die.

874
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:46.658
Do you need help
getting up?

875
01:21:33.763 --> 01:21:36.566
Kill him... Kill him!

876
01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:38.913
Put your sword
into his heart!

877
01:21:41.713 --> 01:21:44.134
Still a gambler, Gerbino.
Want to make a bet?

878
01:21:44.169 --> 01:21:46.633
Go that way,
you're dead.

879
01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:49.774
Come this way
to me, dead.

880
01:21:49.809 --> 01:21:53.483
Go that way...
well, who knows?

881
01:22:12.647 --> 01:22:14.653
Going down.

882
01:22:14.688 --> 01:22:17.416
Oh, Shit!

883
01:22:31.343 --> 01:22:33.918
Friend.
Take my advice.

884
01:22:33.953 --> 01:22:36.984
Do not drink water
from this well.

885
01:22:42.055 --> 01:22:43.605
Sorry.

886
01:22:49.824 --> 01:22:52.737
-So that one's Lorenzo?
-Yes.

887
01:22:52.772 --> 01:22:58.911
By the way I'm not really a priest.
So you're not really married.

888
01:22:59.618 --> 01:23:00.431
I thought you should know.

889
01:23:07.951 --> 01:23:12.454
-Count Dzerzhinsky!
-Pampinea Anastasi.

890
01:23:13.819 --> 01:23:17.347
I have travelled here to you,
from my beloved Novogrod.

891
01:23:17.828 --> 01:23:20.965
To keep faith to fulfill
my promise, to marry you...

892
01:23:21.752 --> 01:23:23.808
and to make you my wife.

893
01:23:24.642 --> 01:23:26.242
I'm here.
Hello.

894
01:23:26.277 --> 01:23:31.782
Count Dzerzhinsky. You are one of the bravest,
most handsome men I've ever met.

895
01:23:31.817 --> 01:23:33.486
Yes, I know.

896
01:23:33.521 --> 01:23:35.301
But I cannot
marry you.

897
01:23:42.796 --> 01:23:46.859
How can you say this after everything
that has happened between us?

898
01:23:48.439 --> 01:23:51.316
What do you mean? I don't understand.
What exactly happened between us?

899
01:23:52.455 --> 01:23:55.517
But... you are not
Pampinea Anastasi.

900
01:23:57.836 --> 01:24:02.792
-She...is Pampinea Anastasi..
-Melissa!

901
01:24:04.923 --> 01:24:07.230
-You know her?
-Know her?

902
01:24:09.177 --> 01:24:10.476
I am in love with her.

903
01:24:22.311 --> 01:24:25.073
Melissa, really,
kissing a perfect stranger.

904
01:24:27.307 --> 01:24:28.972
This doesn't look much like
a wedding, what's going on?

905
01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.249
Filomena, there is going
to be a wedding!

906
01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:33.552
I hope there is going
to be a wedding.

907
01:24:34.934 --> 01:24:35.865
Lorenzo?

908
01:24:37.327 --> 01:24:38.201
Where are you?

909
01:24:49.948 --> 01:24:51.388
Lorenzo!

910
01:24:57.452 --> 01:24:58.282
Lorenzo!

911
01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.571
Lorenzo!

912
01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:12.237
You have stolen my heart.
I love you.

913
01:25:17.801 --> 01:25:18.947
I love you.

914
01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:23.907
Pampinea...

915
01:25:24.608 --> 01:25:26.972
You're one of the most...
no...

916
01:25:29.811 --> 01:25:34.775
the most beautiful girl,
I've ever seen.

917
01:25:35.026 --> 01:25:38.290
But I gave my heart to a kiss,
I can't let go.

918
01:25:40.144 --> 01:25:44.118
If only I could forget her.
I must find her.

919
01:25:47.911 --> 01:25:51.357
Lorenzo, close your eyes.
Please.

920
01:25:52.569 --> 01:25:54.690
Just close your eyes.

921
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:06.609
Every day I see you...
I'm drawn to you.

922
01:26:06.644 --> 01:26:10.204
Every night as I come
beyond for you.

923
01:26:12.704 --> 01:26:15.740
Every day.
Every night.

924
01:26:28.582 --> 01:26:29.833
You...

925
01:26:33.234 --> 01:26:34.567
You.

926
01:26:37.006 --> 01:26:40.200
Now will you forget her?
This girl you kissed?

927
01:26:42.547 --> 01:26:44.100
Never.

928
01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:07.635
<i>So, this is my reward.</i>

929
01:27:07.836 --> 01:27:09.877
<i>I get to stand over
here like a daisy....</i>

930
01:27:10.237 --> 01:27:11.248
<i>while this lot...</i>

931
01:27:11.653 --> 01:27:14.595
<i>well... you can see
for yourselves.</i>

932
01:27:16.354 --> 01:27:20.805
So tra la tra la,
heads up...oohh

933
01:27:24.024 --> 01:27:25.573
<i>Romance.</i>

934
01:27:25.608 --> 01:27:27.202
<i>Passion.</i>

935
01:27:30.648 --> 01:27:34.282
<i>Alright, to hell with this.
I'm back off to the convent.</i>

936
01:27:35.267 --> 01:27:38.455
<i>There's an angel there and
her bottom's got my name on it</i>

937
01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:45.419
Close your eyes again.

938
01:27:46.454 --> 01:27:47.587
No...

939
01:27:49.088 --> 01:27:50.851
You close yours.
