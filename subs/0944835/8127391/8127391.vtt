1
00:00:51.148 --> 00:00:54.067
Please let me go home.
Please, I'm not who you think I am.

2
00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:56.695
I'm really not who you think I am.

3
00:00:57.571 --> 00:00:59.656
Please. Please. I'm not a spy.

4
00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:01.366
- You are a spy.
- I'm not a spy.

5
00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:04.661
- Please let me go home.
- Try again.

6
00:01:04.828 --> 00:01:06.538
I am not a spy.
I am a businesswoman.

7
00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:09.666
I work for Rink Petroleum and Gas.

8
00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:12.085
Please call them.
I work for Rink Petroleum.

9
00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:16.506
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambitions. Yes?

10
00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:19.593
I am not a spy! I am not a spy!

11
00:01:34.107 --> 00:01:36.193
I am not a spy.

12
00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:39.446
<i>I am not a spy.</i>

13
00:01:39.738 --> 00:01:45.243
<i>It is through the grace and munificence
of our glorious Dear Leader...</i>

14
00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:49.164
<i>...that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea...</i>

15
00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:52.918
<i>...has pardoned
the American imperialist...</i>

16
00:01:53.084 --> 00:01:57.172
<i>...for her hostile acts
against our socialist nation.</i>

17
00:01:57.339 --> 00:02:00.884
Keep your head down. Don't say
anything till we make the swap.

18
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:04.679
In case Kim Jong ll here
changes his mind.

19
00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:20.654
Exchange.

20
00:02:20.862 --> 00:02:22.906
Right face!

21
00:02:26.284 --> 00:02:28.245
Right face!

22
00:02:28.578 --> 00:02:30.872
I don't understand.

23
00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.291
You don't understand what?

24
00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:37.963
All the rules say to leave me,
that one life...

25
00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.882
...is not worth blowing
operational cover.

26
00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.259
You got that right.

27
00:02:42.717 --> 00:02:46.429
If we have to lose someone
for the greater good, we will.

28
00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:47.639
So why did you do it?

29
00:02:48.848 --> 00:02:51.643
Well, I didn't do it.

30
00:02:52.727 --> 00:02:54.396
He did.

31
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.608
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

32
00:03:00.735 --> 00:03:03.363
He petitioned the Senate,
the State Department.

33
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.574
We didn't need the publicity
so I figured we better do something...

34
00:03:06.741 --> 00:03:10.287
...or he's gonna invade this
goddamn rice-paddy republic himself.

35
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.847
You okay?

36
00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:32.434
Yeah.

37
00:04:16.936 --> 00:04:18.229
Hey.

38
00:04:19.773 --> 00:04:22.192
- Good morning.
- Happy anniversary.

39
00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.404
You want me to make you breakfast?

40
00:04:26.571 --> 00:04:28.990
How about pancakes?

41
00:04:29.157 --> 00:04:31.117
Your cooking?

42
00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.286
You're joking. You like my cooking.

43
00:04:33.453 --> 00:04:35.455
Germans don't joke.

44
00:04:36.456 --> 00:04:38.583
Burt likes my cooking.

45
00:04:46.257 --> 00:04:47.675
Get your bugs off the table.

46
00:04:47.842 --> 00:04:49.928
- They're spiders.
- They're bugs.

47
00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:52.972
- They're spiders.
- They're bugs.

48
00:04:57.852 --> 00:05:01.940
<i>Fold the next layer back
as you did the two before it.</i>

49
00:05:02.107 --> 00:05:05.693
<i>Turn the napkin over.
Fold both sides back...</i>

50
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.696
<i>...and over one another
about a third of the way.</i>

51
00:05:10.365 --> 00:05:14.202
<i>Check for symmetry
and press the fold down well.</i>

52
00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:16.496
Are you doing this
on company time?

53
00:05:16.663 --> 00:05:20.333
<i>- And insert your favorite silverware...</i>
- It's my anniversary.

54
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.837
And I want it to be perfect.

55
00:05:24.003 --> 00:05:25.547
But...

56
00:05:25.755 --> 00:05:27.215
...that is not sexy.

57
00:05:27.924 --> 00:05:30.093
No, but it is utilitarian.

58
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.429
And utilitarian is the new sexy.

59
00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:36.182
I ran the trace. First name Usam,
last name Utsaev.

60
00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:37.851
- Any verifiable hits?
- One.

61
00:05:38.017 --> 00:05:41.354
Hey, Francis, do me a favor and
stick that in the safe till tomorrow.

62
00:05:41.521 --> 00:05:43.606
Mata Hari here's
got a big night tonight.

63
00:05:43.773 --> 00:05:45.984
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

64
00:05:46.192 --> 00:05:49.112
"Sir"? Do I look like a "sir" to you?

65
00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.321
From head to toe.

66
00:05:51.156 --> 00:05:53.616
I'm surprised he didn't call you
"Your Majesty."

67
00:05:53.783 --> 00:05:57.954
I like the ring of that.
I think I'd prefer "Your Majesty."

68
00:05:58.997 --> 00:06:00.832
Was I ever that young?

69
00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:04.294
Younger.

70
00:06:05.086 --> 00:06:06.796
Walk me out.

71
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:09.799
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

72
00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:11.801
Oh, you know. The usual.

73
00:06:11.968 --> 00:06:14.387
President wants to know
what's happening in Russia...

74
00:06:14.554 --> 00:06:18.516
...the day before it happens. How about
you? I heard that interview went well.

75
00:06:18.683 --> 00:06:20.393
Fingers crossed.

76
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.812
You sure about this?

77
00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.940
You know, once you start pushing
paper, there's no turning back.

78
00:06:26.107 --> 00:06:29.486
I had the strangest feeling
when I was out last time.

79
00:06:29.652 --> 00:06:32.113
- I was homesick.
- Homesick?

80
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.616
- Sir! Sir!
- Can't you take something for that?

81
00:06:36.826 --> 00:06:39.370
We got a walk-in.
A defector, 10 minutes ago.

82
00:06:39.537 --> 00:06:41.873
- Here?
- I guess he's not buying our cover.

83
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.042
- Did you get his bona fides?
- He's Russian.

84
00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:46.336
He says he's FSB
but won't give us any more.

85
00:06:46.753 --> 00:06:48.713
- He's a strange guy.
- How's his English?

86
00:06:49.297 --> 00:06:51.007
Passable. Not great.

87
00:06:51.174 --> 00:06:54.052
But if it got down to
the subtleties of English nuance...

88
00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:57.847
- Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me.
- Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.

89
00:06:58.014 --> 00:06:59.057
Come on, Salt.

90
00:06:59.224 --> 00:07:02.393
No one can sort out a nutjob
from the real thing faster than you.

91
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.605
- I got 25 minutes.
- I got 26. Let's go.

92
00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:14.614
Yeah, okay. Well, we'll decide
when we know more.

93
00:07:15.156 --> 00:07:17.033
- Who called Counterintelligence?
- Not me.

94
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.827
Hey, Ted. We're crashing the party.

95
00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:23.831
- Peabody.
- Salt.

96
00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:30.797
Please remove the hood.

97
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.508
Microphones are on.

98
00:07:33.675 --> 00:07:35.635
Checking levels.

99
00:07:37.053 --> 00:07:38.346
Baseline recorded.

100
00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:45.562
Neural scan is up. Ready to go.

101
00:07:47.397 --> 00:07:49.816
- Ev.
- Yeah.

102
00:07:49.983 --> 00:07:52.151
Commencing audio
and visual recording.

103
00:08:00.118 --> 00:08:02.287
<i>Testing earpiece.</i>

104
00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:07.834
Interview has commenced at 1442.

105
00:08:17.677 --> 00:08:19.637
You're married.

106
00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:24.183
A husband must be a distraction...

107
00:08:24.892 --> 00:08:27.979
...for a female intelligence officer.

108
00:08:28.146 --> 00:08:30.315
Well, we're here to talk about you.

109
00:08:30.523 --> 00:08:31.649
So, what is your name?

110
00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:35.194
My name is...

111
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:39.741
...Oleg Vassilyevich Orlov.

112
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:45.163
I have cancer.

113
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.373
I'm moved.

114
00:08:47.665 --> 00:08:49.667
A defector with cancer.

115
00:08:50.376 --> 00:08:53.880
Are you selling secrets for chemo
or are you afraid of dying?

116
00:08:54.047 --> 00:08:58.718
If I have gained anything
by damning myself...

117
00:08:59.135 --> 00:09:04.974
...it is that I no longer
have anything to fear.

118
00:09:05.933 --> 00:09:08.603
<i>Russia is also dying.</i>

119
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.190
<i>- But unlike me, she's not dead.</i>
- Oleg Vassily Orlov...

120
00:09:12.357 --> 00:09:16.069
...shows up in 1993
in Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia.

121
00:09:16.277 --> 00:09:18.529
He was on Victor Barisovsky's
staff there.

122
00:09:18.738 --> 00:09:19.989
<i>He checks out as FSB, Ev.</i>

123
00:09:20.156 --> 00:09:23.034
Scan says he's truthful
on the cancer.

124
00:09:23.409 --> 00:09:24.619
Prior to '93?

125
00:09:24.869 --> 00:09:28.081
<i>- Russia was once strong, powerful...</i>
- Nothing.

126
00:09:28.581 --> 00:09:29.582
He doesn't exist.

127
00:09:29.749 --> 00:09:33.503
<i>And she will be again
when things have been set back...</i>

128
00:09:33.711 --> 00:09:35.672
...on the correct path.

129
00:09:35.922 --> 00:09:38.633
I have somewhere I need to be,
Mr. Orlov...

130
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.386
...so if you wouldn't mind
getting to the point.

131
00:09:44.555 --> 00:09:47.767
I came here to tell you a story.

132
00:09:48.685 --> 00:09:50.478
I don't like stories.

133
00:09:50.895 --> 00:09:53.439
But I'll listen anyway.

134
00:09:53.606 --> 00:09:55.525
In English, please.

135
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.485
Others are listening.

136
00:09:58.444 --> 00:10:01.406
1975.

137
00:10:01.864 --> 00:10:04.117
The Cold War.

138
00:10:05.576 --> 00:10:07.704
<i>In a gymnasium in Grozny...</i>

139
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.123
<i>...a Soviet Olympic wrestler...</i>

140
00:10:10.289 --> 00:10:13.835
<i>...named Sasha Fyorodovich
Chenkov.</i> ..

141
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.920
<i>...meets for the first time...</i>

142
00:10:16.504 --> 00:10:20.425
<i>...the only female chess grand master
of her era:</i>

143
00:10:21.843 --> 00:10:25.304
<i>Anja Nurekyova.</i>

144
00:10:25.596 --> 00:10:28.683
<i>Within a month, they were married.</i>

145
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.311
<i>And within a year, a child.</i>

146
00:10:32.895 --> 00:10:34.897
<i>One month more...</i>

147
00:10:35.064 --> 00:10:39.110
...the child was back
in the same hospital...

148
00:10:39.277 --> 00:10:40.653
...sick with fever.

149
00:10:43.281 --> 00:10:45.575
<i>And within days after that...</i>

150
00:10:45.742 --> 00:10:49.328
<i>...the child suddenly was dead.</i>

151
00:10:51.497 --> 00:10:55.376
<i>Yes, a child was dead.</i>

152
00:10:55.543 --> 00:10:59.756
<i>And, yes, a child was buried.</i>

153
00:11:06.387 --> 00:11:10.516
<i>But the Chenkov baby was alive...</i>

154
00:11:10.683 --> 00:11:15.062
<i>...and became the property
of another man.</i>

155
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.609
<i>A master spy who had
devised the greatest plan...</i>

156
00:11:19.776 --> 00:11:24.113
<i>...a Russian patriot
could ever invent.</i>

157
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.618
<i>A plan to destroy America.</i>

158
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.245
<i>It had all started...</i>

159
00:11:31.412 --> 00:11:35.374
...with an American named
Lee Harvey Oswald.

160
00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:39.670
<i>In 1959, he emigrated to Russia.</i>

161
00:11:39.837 --> 00:11:42.757
<i>Three years later, he returned home.</i>

162
00:11:42.924 --> 00:11:45.718
<i>But the man
who came back to America...</i>

163
00:11:45.885 --> 00:11:51.349
{\an8}<i>...was in fact a Russian spy
named Alek.</i>

164
00:11:51.724 --> 00:11:55.269
<i>On November 22nd, 1963...</i>

165
00:11:55.436 --> 00:11:58.189
<i>...Alek became the first success
of the new program...</i>

166
00:12:00.066 --> 00:12:03.653
<i>...and a hero of the Soviet Union.</i>

167
00:12:04.028 --> 00:12:06.948
<i>The spymaster was now
given the go-ahead...</i>

168
00:12:07.114 --> 00:12:09.951
<i>...to create many more like Alek.</i>

169
00:12:10.117 --> 00:12:13.579
<i>Scores of agents,
males and females...</i>

170
00:12:13.746 --> 00:12:16.374
<i>...to be substituted for Americans.</i>

171
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:20.044
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

172
00:12:20.586 --> 00:12:22.547
{\an8}<i>At an abandoned monastery...</i>

173
00:12:22.713 --> 00:12:26.467
{\an8}<i>...Chenkov and other boys and girls
learned English...</i>

174
00:12:26.634 --> 00:12:29.178
...long before they learned Russian.

175
00:12:29.345 --> 00:12:31.472
Drilled in idiom...

176
00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:33.891
<i>...idiosyncrasy and...</i>

177
00:12:35.059 --> 00:12:36.185
...ideology.

178
00:12:37.687 --> 00:12:42.608
<i>And by methods of rigorous physical
and psychological programming...</i>

179
00:12:42.775 --> 00:12:45.820
<i>...the spymaster
made warriors of iron.</i>

180
00:12:45.987 --> 00:12:49.365
<i>Unquestioning and unbreakable.</i>

181
00:12:50.533 --> 00:12:52.827
You're killing me, man.

182
00:12:53.327 --> 00:12:55.204
When does the good fairy come in?

183
00:12:55.663 --> 00:12:57.331
Never.

184
00:12:57.498 --> 00:12:59.083
It's a story without hope.

185
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:04.422
Chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting American family.

186
00:13:04.589 --> 00:13:08.134
There was an accident.
The family died.

187
00:13:08.301 --> 00:13:11.262
Chenkov was sent to America...

188
00:13:11.429 --> 00:13:14.807
...to live a complete lie...

189
00:13:14.974 --> 00:13:18.853
...and to patiently await the day
to attack from within.

190
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.063
Day X.

191
00:13:21.314 --> 00:13:25.735
The long-awaited mission is here.

192
00:13:26.444 --> 00:13:29.405
Chenkov will travel
to New York City...

193
00:13:29.572 --> 00:13:33.743
...to kill the president of Russia...

194
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:39.498
...at the funeral of
the American vice president.

195
00:13:40.666 --> 00:13:45.129
Chenkov is KA 12.

196
00:13:45.463 --> 00:13:47.965
- "KA."
- Cold War legend.

197
00:13:48.132 --> 00:13:49.967
Highly trained
Russian sleeper agents...

198
00:13:50.134 --> 00:13:54.013
...inserted into American society
to sabotage and assassinate.

199
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.059
Supposedly they'd wait years
to strike. Decades, even.

200
00:13:58.434 --> 00:14:00.186
Supposedly.

201
00:14:00.353 --> 00:14:03.397
- What, you don't believe in moles?
- I believe in moles, all right.

202
00:14:03.564 --> 00:14:04.899
Just not the bogeyman.

203
00:14:05.066 --> 00:14:08.027
Especially if the plan is
to kill their own president.

204
00:14:08.194 --> 00:14:10.112
This guy's selling smoke.

205
00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:12.198
Wrap it up, Ev.

206
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.662
So a Russian agent is going to kill
the Russian president? Is that it?

207
00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:20.373
Okay.

208
00:14:20.665 --> 00:14:22.792
Thank you very much.

209
00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:26.545
And what would you like
in return for that information?

210
00:14:26.712 --> 00:14:29.423
I simply wish to help you do...

211
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.009
...what you need to do.

212
00:14:34.512 --> 00:14:36.472
You're good.

213
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.352
The KA program
is brilliant bullshit.

214
00:14:42.561 --> 00:14:44.563
But I'm officially off duty...

215
00:14:44.939 --> 00:14:48.359
...so you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

216
00:14:48.776 --> 00:14:50.611
- Salt.
- Yes?

217
00:14:51.112 --> 00:14:55.116
The name of the Russian agent
is Salt.

218
00:14:55.741 --> 00:14:57.743
Evelyn Salt.

219
00:15:01.163 --> 00:15:03.082
My name is Evelyn Salt.

220
00:15:04.291 --> 00:15:06.377
Then you are a Russian spy.

221
00:15:08.087 --> 00:15:09.130
<i>Truthful.</i>

222
00:15:09.588 --> 00:15:15.094
So far the fMRI scan registers truthful
on everything he's said.

223
00:15:18.514 --> 00:15:19.974
Ted?

224
00:15:25.604 --> 00:15:28.274
Call Protective Services,
make sure they find my husband.

225
00:15:28.441 --> 00:15:31.110
- I need to get to the phone.
- Not after the neural scan.

226
00:15:31.277 --> 00:15:34.071
I can beat that thing
five times out of six.

227
00:15:34.238 --> 00:15:36.198
I am trained to, and so is he.

228
00:15:36.657 --> 00:15:38.993
I need my phone.
I need to call my husband.

229
00:15:39.243 --> 00:15:41.746
- Let me call my husband.
- Let me see it.

230
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.335
There's a reason he mentioned
my wedding ring, Ted.

231
00:15:48.502 --> 00:15:50.296
They don't just blow up their cover...

232
00:15:50.463 --> 00:15:52.965
...they blow up their whole cover life.
You know that.

233
00:15:53.132 --> 00:15:55.760
- Do you remember Hen|ey's wife?
- Yes, I do.

234
00:15:56.177 --> 00:15:57.428
Speaker.

235
00:15:58.345 --> 00:16:01.390
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone. Thanks. Bye.</i>

236
00:16:01.557 --> 00:16:04.268
Honey, it's me. Please call me
as soon as you get this.

237
00:16:04.435 --> 00:16:06.479
Okay, sweetheart?
As soon as you get this.

238
00:16:06.645 --> 00:16:08.981
Godspeed, Comrade Chenkov.

239
00:16:09.899 --> 00:16:14.153
Someone interrogate that piece of shit.
Someone who enjoys getting answers.

240
00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:16.822
Look, Ev, try to stay calm.

241
00:16:16.989 --> 00:16:20.785
- I'm not a goddamn Russian spy.
- I didn't say you were.

242
00:16:20.951 --> 00:16:23.079
Let's go up to my office,
we can sort this out.

243
00:16:23.245 --> 00:16:26.332
No, no. We gotta go to
a secure location. Now.

244
00:16:26.499 --> 00:16:27.792
All right.

245
00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:30.669
Doesn't get any more secure
than this.

246
00:16:30.961 --> 00:16:34.006
Ev? Five minutes.

247
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:38.844
- Call Protective Services, find Mike.
- I will.

248
00:16:39.011 --> 00:16:41.180
This is bullshit.

249
00:16:45.142 --> 00:16:47.019
Give us a sec, we'll be right in.

250
00:16:48.646 --> 00:16:50.648
I know we're heading
into your jurisdiction.

251
00:16:50.815 --> 00:16:52.608
- I'm just asking for five minutes.
- No.

252
00:16:59.573 --> 00:17:02.576
If I have to. You can't have
five minutes. I have to talk to her.

253
00:17:02.743 --> 00:17:05.162
- She's scared. Don't you see that?
- I don't care.

254
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:08.707
There is a mole in Russia house, Ted.
There is a mole. I am sure.

255
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.764
Please step in the elevator.

256
00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:52.418
...Russian president, okay? So I'm
gonna ask you to step out of my way.

257
00:17:58.841 --> 00:18:00.759
What the hell is that?

258
00:18:01.218 --> 00:18:02.386
Sir.

259
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.756
{\an8}<i>- Where do you think he went?
- No one saw him coming out the front.</i>

260
00:18:40.507 --> 00:18:42.593
{\an8}- Jesus Christ.
- Here he is again.

261
00:18:43.302 --> 00:18:45.804
No sign of him so far on the street.

262
00:18:45.971 --> 00:18:47.765
It's two minutes ago,
before lockdown.

263
00:18:47.932 --> 00:18:50.559
- Anything clean on him?
- We just got a match, sir.

264
00:18:50.726 --> 00:18:52.436
It's May Day, 1981.

265
00:18:52.603 --> 00:18:54.813
There's Brezhnev. And there...

266
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.106
- Orlov.
- That's him.

267
00:18:56.273 --> 00:18:59.151
{\an8}He used to be a heavyweight
once upon a time.

268
00:18:59.443 --> 00:19:01.403
Get that photo out.
Every ticket counter...

269
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.615
...airport, train station, taxi dispatcher,
the whole nine yards.

270
00:19:04.782 --> 00:19:07.952
- Get me Medford on a secure line.
- Yes, sir.

271
00:19:09.078 --> 00:19:11.830
- Top-right screen. Is that live?
- Yes, sir.

272
00:19:11.997 --> 00:19:13.374
Where is she going? Track her.

273
00:19:15.334 --> 00:19:18.003
<i>No one may leave the building.</i>

274
00:19:18.504 --> 00:19:20.422
Rink Petroleum, Security.

275
00:19:20.589 --> 00:19:23.509
Yes, you have a woman to your left,
behind you. Evelyn Salt.

276
00:19:26.178 --> 00:19:29.181
- We lost the visual on her.
- Damn it. Where'd she go?

277
00:19:29.348 --> 00:19:31.183
<i>We are on security lockdown.</i>

278
00:19:32.184 --> 00:19:34.186
Dave? It's Evelyn, is Mike there?

279
00:19:34.395 --> 00:19:36.689
<i>No, I'm sorry. He left after lunch.</i>

280
00:19:36.855 --> 00:19:38.440
<i>Hey, happy anniversary, huh?</i>

281
00:19:38.607 --> 00:19:40.276
The stairwell.

282
00:19:40.693 --> 00:19:42.987
- Second floor.
- What's on that floor?

283
00:19:43.153 --> 00:19:45.823
- It's empty, a security buffer.
- Isolate and seal it.

284
00:19:53.706 --> 00:19:55.291
Get her records to my handheld.

285
00:19:57.459 --> 00:19:59.169
{\an8}East corridor.

286
00:20:05.217 --> 00:20:06.885
<i>Notifying Metropolitan Police.</i>

287
00:20:15.644 --> 00:20:17.479
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

288
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.944
{\an8}We got her.

289
00:20:25.362 --> 00:20:26.447
{\an8}<i>Looking down all floors.</i>

290
00:20:26.739 --> 00:20:29.033
<i>Security Protective Service
responding to threat.</i>

291
00:20:31.827 --> 00:20:35.289
All right. Get a tactical team
to meet me on the south stairwell.

292
00:20:35.456 --> 00:20:37.624
- Yes, sir.
- Director Medford, sir.

293
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:39.626
Get me a side arm.

294
00:20:41.503 --> 00:20:42.755
I'll call her back.

295
00:20:47.926 --> 00:20:50.721
- Shit.
- Lost visual.

296
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.640
Where is she, Albert? Talk to me.

297
00:20:54.433 --> 00:20:55.934
Come on.

298
00:21:03.776 --> 00:21:05.652
{\an8}North hallway.

299
00:21:21.043 --> 00:21:23.379
There, interrogation room,
bring it up.

300
00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:03.335
Switch down, switch down.

301
00:22:09.341 --> 00:22:12.344
- Have you found him?
<i>- What the hell are you doing, Ev?</i>

302
00:22:12.511 --> 00:22:13.679
This doesn't look good.

303
00:22:14.346 --> 00:22:15.597
- Let's do it.
- Move.

304
00:22:16.014 --> 00:22:18.225
There's a tac team coming at you
in 30 seconds.

305
00:22:18.392 --> 00:22:19.852
Get your panties off the camera.

306
00:22:20.018 --> 00:22:22.187
<i>Get where we can see you
so you don't get hurt.</i>

307
00:22:22.354 --> 00:22:25.357
- Have you found my husband?
<i>- These boys aren't fooling around.</i>

308
00:22:30.028 --> 00:22:32.698
<i>Please. I can't help you
unless you talk to me.</i>

309
00:22:32.865 --> 00:22:34.408
Call me when you find Mike.

310
00:22:35.033 --> 00:22:36.869
<i>Sweeping corridors
outside the elevator.</i>

311
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.584
Put the masks on.

312
00:22:44.001 --> 00:22:45.043
Situation is hot.

313
00:22:54.887 --> 00:22:57.389
<i>Open the door about two feet.
We're gonna gas her.</i>

314
00:22:57.556 --> 00:23:00.934
- Tac team in position. Waiting for a go.
- Is that absolutely necessary?

315
00:23:01.101 --> 00:23:02.895
What, you want me to shoot her?

316
00:23:03.228 --> 00:23:05.272
Get a medical team in place now.

317
00:23:18.869 --> 00:23:20.496
We're ready.

318
00:23:24.917 --> 00:23:25.918
Now.

319
00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:34.760
<i>Okay, on my count.</i>

320
00:23:34.927 --> 00:23:38.472
{\an8}Three, two, one. Go.

321
00:23:45.354 --> 00:23:46.772
Jesus Christ.

322
00:24:00.619 --> 00:24:03.830
Where is she? Come on, guys.

323
00:24:03.997 --> 00:24:06.875
- Find her, Albert. Now.
<i>- Suspect has escaped.</i>

324
00:24:07.292 --> 00:24:09.086
There. Bring that up.

325
00:24:12.089 --> 00:24:14.007
Stay with her,
she's crossing the street.

326
00:24:14.174 --> 00:24:15.676
Pan the goddamn camera.

327
00:24:27.813 --> 00:24:29.648
Back that up and zoom in.

328
00:24:29.815 --> 00:24:32.651
- We're looking for Michael Krause.
- Freeze.

329
00:24:33.151 --> 00:24:36.488
- We're looking for her husband, Mike.
- What the hell are you doing, Ev?

330
00:24:36.655 --> 00:24:37.299
Wait, when was that?
No. No message.

331
00:24:37.323 --> 00:24:39.491
Wait, when was that?
No. No message.

332
00:24:39.908 --> 00:24:42.286
Let's switch to the exterior cameras.

333
00:24:42.452 --> 00:24:45.372
Michael Krause left his office
at the Smithsonian an hour ago.

334
00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:47.291
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes away.

335
00:24:47.457 --> 00:24:49.418
We can cover it,
but she won't go there.

336
00:24:49.585 --> 00:24:52.254
She will if she's serious about Mike.
This stays in-house.

337
00:24:52.421 --> 00:24:53.964
Okay.

338
00:24:54.131 --> 00:24:55.841
Taxi!

339
00:24:59.386 --> 00:25:01.305
U Street. I'll tell you when to stop.

340
00:25:09.146 --> 00:25:13.150
<i>Hi, this is Mike. Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

341
00:25:39.635 --> 00:25:42.095
He's one of the world's
top arachnologists, Ev...

342
00:25:42.262 --> 00:25:45.349
...and as such, enjoys pretty much
unrestricted access...

343
00:25:45.515 --> 00:25:47.934
...to the borders of North Korea.

344
00:25:48.101 --> 00:25:51.563
So brush up on your bugs
and get to know him.

345
00:25:53.273 --> 00:25:56.068
<i>He's the perfect cover
to get us inside.</i>

346
00:26:35.857 --> 00:26:37.359
Mike?

347
00:26:39.945 --> 00:26:42.948
Mike? Honey?

348
00:26:49.287 --> 00:26:51.331
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

349
00:26:51.498 --> 00:26:53.458
It's all right.

350
00:26:53.667 --> 00:26:56.795
It's okay. Where's Daddy?
Where's Daddy?

351
00:27:28.994 --> 00:27:30.662
Come on. Come on.

352
00:27:36.293 --> 00:27:38.462
Check for back exits.

353
00:27:56.229 --> 00:27:58.023
Go! Go!

354
00:28:02.027 --> 00:28:04.279
Bedroom, clear!

355
00:28:05.697 --> 00:28:07.657
Kitchen is clear.

356
00:28:09.367 --> 00:28:11.453
Office, clear!

357
00:28:11.912 --> 00:28:14.372
Living room, clear!

358
00:28:41.107 --> 00:28:43.193
Everybody out. Sixty seconds.

359
00:29:11.054 --> 00:29:12.764
<i>Come here.</i>

360
00:29:13.932 --> 00:29:15.350
What are you doing?

361
00:29:15.517 --> 00:29:18.019
She's not here.
No sign of the husband either.

362
00:29:18.186 --> 00:29:20.689
Did it ever occur to you that
that Russian was lying?

363
00:29:20.856 --> 00:29:22.357
- Why'd she run?
- I don't know.

364
00:29:22.524 --> 00:29:25.443
Because you were gonna lock her up?
See it from her perspective.

365
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:27.696
Maybe her husband
is in some real danger.

366
00:29:27.863 --> 00:29:30.115
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

367
00:29:30.323 --> 00:29:31.950
"Maybe" is your department.

368
00:29:32.117 --> 00:29:34.786
Mine is catching her
so we can find out.

369
00:29:34.953 --> 00:29:37.622
Protocol is clear. We bring her in
or we bring her down.

370
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:39.916
Do you have any idea
who this woman is?

371
00:29:40.083 --> 00:29:43.128
What she's done for this country?
Does that mean anything to you?

372
00:29:43.295 --> 00:29:44.504
Should it?

373
00:29:47.966 --> 00:29:49.342
- Is your mom home?
- No.

374
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:51.136
- No? Can you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

375
00:29:51.303 --> 00:29:53.471
Hi. You babysit Burt for me?

376
00:29:53.638 --> 00:29:57.642
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah? Here's some money for food.

377
00:29:58.184 --> 00:29:59.561
Hi, Burt.

378
00:29:59.728 --> 00:30:03.732
- What you doing? You doing homework?
- Yeah, math.

379
00:30:04.774 --> 00:30:07.569
- Algebra.
- I hate math.

380
00:30:19.164 --> 00:30:21.541
Hi. Nice to see you again.

381
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.838
- You talking to me?
- Yeah, I've seen you here before.

382
00:30:27.172 --> 00:30:28.673
Yeah, I do. I come here a lot.

383
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.885
You?

384
00:30:32.677 --> 00:30:34.721
Oh, I'm working here.

385
00:30:34.888 --> 00:30:36.848
At the museum.

386
00:30:37.807 --> 00:30:41.353
- I'm an arachnologist.
- A what?

387
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:42.955
<i>I hunt spiders.</i>

388
00:30:42.979 --> 00:30:44.022
<i>I hunt spiders.</i>

389
00:30:58.119 --> 00:30:59.204
I got her.

390
00:30:59.371 --> 00:31:02.123
<i>She's heading north
towards the Metro station.</i>

391
00:31:02.791 --> 00:31:03.875
Ev!

392
00:31:28.274 --> 00:31:29.776
Ev!

393
00:31:39.869 --> 00:31:42.330
She's eastbound,
in the Penn Quarter Mall.

394
00:31:46.251 --> 00:31:47.752
Excuse me.

395
00:32:00.056 --> 00:32:02.517
<i>- Will do. Headed there now.</i>
- There she 'vs.

396
00:32:03.893 --> 00:32:06.771
All teams, southbound
toward the bridge. Box her in.

397
00:32:17.657 --> 00:32:18.700
Circle around!

398
00:32:18.908 --> 00:32:20.618
Salt! Stop!

399
00:32:20.785 --> 00:32:23.079
- Keep her in your sights!
- Coming up behind you!

400
00:32:23.246 --> 00:32:24.622
Fuck!

401
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.628
Keep back! Hold your fire!

402
00:32:31.129 --> 00:32:33.006
Salt! Down!

403
00:32:34.632 --> 00:32:36.301
Salt!

404
00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.100
Spread out!

405
00:32:45.185 --> 00:32:47.312
- Salt!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot, I'm innocent!

406
00:32:47.479 --> 00:32:49.606
- On the ground. Now!
- Please don't. No!

407
00:32:49.773 --> 00:32:52.817
Down! Salt! Do it now!
On the ground!

408
00:32:52.984 --> 00:32:54.194
I have to find my husband.

409
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.154
- Why'd you run?
- To find my husband!

410
00:32:56.321 --> 00:32:58.114
- That's not a reason.
- Don't shoot.

411
00:32:58.281 --> 00:32:59.657
- Stay back!
- Last chance.

412
00:32:59.824 --> 00:33:02.327
I'm innocent.
Somebody is setting me up!

413
00:33:02.494 --> 00:33:04.829
- Don't make me put you down.
- Put the gun down!

414
00:33:04.996 --> 00:33:06.539
- Give yourself up!
- Come on, Ev.

415
00:33:06.748 --> 00:33:09.250
Do what he says.
We'll sort this out, I promise.

416
00:33:09.542 --> 00:33:12.670
I gotta bring you in, Salt.
It's over. Face down.

417
00:33:12.837 --> 00:33:15.465
Somebody's going to try to
kill the Russian president.

418
00:33:15.632 --> 00:33:18.384
Do something about that!
That's what you should worry about.

419
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.845
There's nowhere to run! Quit now!

420
00:33:21.012 --> 00:33:22.347
No, I didn't do anything.

421
00:33:22.514 --> 00:33:23.890
Get back! No!

422
00:33:31.856 --> 00:33:34.526
She's on a blue semi.
Route 1, heading north.

423
00:33:34.692 --> 00:33:36.528
Get a roadblock in place now.

424
00:33:48.623 --> 00:33:50.542
<i>Metro Police on alert.</i>

425
00:34:28.621 --> 00:34:31.749
There she is. On the tanker.

426
00:34:32.417 --> 00:34:34.460
Stop. Stop!

427
00:34:44.846 --> 00:34:46.389
Ev!

428
00:35:02.322 --> 00:35:04.699
You, my friend, have got
a mole in your group.

429
00:35:05.116 --> 00:35:08.119
- We don't know that yet.
- I'd say she's a trained goddamn liar...

430
00:35:08.286 --> 00:35:10.997
...and everything she's said
has been to protect her cover.

431
00:35:11.164 --> 00:35:13.791
Well, why don't you tell me
how you really feel about it?

432
00:36:04.175 --> 00:36:06.636
Get up on the shoulder!
Get up on the shoulder!

433
00:36:26.155 --> 00:36:27.240
Okay, take it down.

434
00:36:37.959 --> 00:36:39.085
Shit!

435
00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.423
Shit!

436
00:36:50.013 --> 00:36:51.055
Okay.

437
00:36:51.556 --> 00:36:53.850
Ted, I know you're her friend...

438
00:36:54.559 --> 00:36:56.477
...but we gotta drop a net
on New York.

439
00:36:56.853 --> 00:36:59.731
- We gotta do it now.
- Let's go!

440
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.820
Notify the Secret Service
on Matveyev's detail.

441
00:37:07.196 --> 00:37:09.741
Tell them Salt might be
coming their way.

442
00:37:11.075 --> 00:37:13.619
And if she is,
Orlov may not be far behind either.

443
00:37:17.623 --> 00:37:18.666
You seen this?

444
00:37:18.833 --> 00:37:21.252
Salt spent time in Russia as a kid.

445
00:37:21.669 --> 00:37:25.715
She was in a car accident with
her parents in '88. They both died.

446
00:37:27.133 --> 00:37:31.763
They were teachers at the U.S. Embassy
for the American children of the staff.

447
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.891
That's why we put her on Russia
in the first place.

448
00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:39.937
We need to get on a plane
to New York, tonight.

449
00:37:40.521 --> 00:37:43.608
Send everything we've got on Orlov
to N.Y.P.D.

450
00:38:29.821 --> 00:38:32.949
<i>And here in New York City,
security has been beefed up...</i>

451
00:38:33.116 --> 00:38:35.743
<i>...and preparations are continuing
well into the night...</i>

452
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.996
<i>...for the funeral of
Vice President Maxwell Oates.</i>

453
00:38:39.163 --> 00:38:43.709
<i>Among the dignitaries attending the
service at St. Bartholomew's Church...</i>

454
00:38:43.876 --> 00:38:46.337
<i>...is Russian president
Boris Matveyev...</i>

455
00:38:46.504 --> 00:38:49.006
<i>...who arrived here in Manhattan
earlier this evening.</i>

456
00:38:49.173 --> 00:38:54.137
<i>Public transportation will experience
delays, with subway closures and...</i>

457
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:59.183
Evelyn.

458
00:38:59.642 --> 00:39:01.394
Look at me.

459
00:39:03.896 --> 00:39:06.232
If there was a way, I would kill them.

460
00:39:09.193 --> 00:39:11.028
You shouldn't have come here.

461
00:39:11.195 --> 00:39:13.739
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

462
00:39:15.366 --> 00:39:17.618
Now they know who you are.

463
00:39:18.035 --> 00:39:19.662
Who?

464
00:39:20.663 --> 00:39:22.498
Evelyn.

465
00:39:23.708 --> 00:39:25.543
Who?

466
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.881
I would accept anything about you...

467
00:39:30.047 --> 00:39:31.799
...but I need to know.

468
00:39:31.966 --> 00:39:35.052
So look at me. Look at me.

469
00:39:37.054 --> 00:39:39.724
Just tell me, okay?

470
00:39:40.266 --> 00:39:41.392
Just tell me.

471
00:39:43.895 --> 00:39:45.646
I work...

472
00:39:47.064 --> 00:39:48.566
I work for the CIA.

473
00:39:51.068 --> 00:39:53.070
So you see, there's...

474
00:39:54.113 --> 00:39:56.991
There's no future for us.

475
00:39:59.577 --> 00:40:02.079
You're not safe with me.

476
00:40:03.414 --> 00:40:05.583
I don't wanna be safe.

477
00:40:08.085 --> 00:40:09.795
I know you...

478
00:40:10.421 --> 00:40:12.632
...and I wanna be with you.

479
00:40:13.883 --> 00:40:17.428
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you.

480
00:40:19.388 --> 00:40:20.890
Okay?

481
00:40:22.308 --> 00:40:25.728
Okay. Okay.

482
00:40:45.456 --> 00:40:49.669
Welcome to New York, Miss Hernandez.
One night, a deluxe room.

483
00:40:50.127 --> 00:40:51.963
Do you need any help
with your luggage?

484
00:40:52.129 --> 00:40:53.297
Nope, I got it. Thanks.

485
00:41:00.304 --> 00:41:04.267
- I'll put these in the closet, sir?
- Yeah, fine.

486
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:41.906
A solemn day here in New York City.

487
00:42:42.073 --> 00:42:44.992
The funeral of Vice President
Maxwell Oates...

488
00:42:45.159 --> 00:42:48.913
...a former five-term U.S. senator
and Cold War warrior...

489
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.415
...whose greatest legacy
may be as architect...

490
00:42:51.582 --> 00:42:54.919
...of the new era
of Russian-American relations.

491
00:42:55.086 --> 00:42:57.088
{\an8}Russian president Boris Matveyev...

492
00:42:57.254 --> 00:43:00.007
{\an8}<i>...has journeyed from Moscow
to be an honorary pallbearer...</i>

493
00:43:00.174 --> 00:43:04.428
<i>...to the man he's called
his greatest friend in the West.</i>

494
00:44:02.278 --> 00:44:04.613
What's the security perimeter?

495
00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.825
We're two deep inside
and we own this entire block.

496
00:44:07.992 --> 00:44:11.328
And those are Secret Service agents,
not CIA.

497
00:44:11.495 --> 00:44:14.957
- So relax.
- That's real funny.

498
00:44:15.499 --> 00:44:17.668
Didn't know you guys told jokes.

499
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:22.757
Detail, halt.

500
00:44:25.009 --> 00:44:27.178
Forward, march.

501
00:44:44.028 --> 00:44:48.449
<i>Due to the funeral,
the 51st Street station is closed.</i>

502
00:44:51.786 --> 00:44:57.333
<i>Repeat: Due to the funeral,
the 51st Street station is closed.</i>

503
00:45:01.253 --> 00:45:02.713
What...? Hey, what's going on?

504
00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.799
Hey! There's smoke.

505
00:45:07.051 --> 00:45:10.095
Step back, step back.
Everybody, move out of the way.

506
00:45:44.588 --> 00:45:46.882
Eleanor. Good to see you.

507
00:45:47.424 --> 00:45:49.176
Thank you.

508
00:45:51.971 --> 00:45:55.140
- Boris.
- Mr. President.

509
00:45:59.436 --> 00:46:00.980
Hello.

510
00:46:11.991 --> 00:46:14.201
Please be seated.

511
00:46:26.213 --> 00:46:28.799
<i>Stand by for president's speech.</i>

512
00:46:30.509 --> 00:46:34.972
<i>Patrolling church exterior.
No one in or out the side doors.</i>

513
00:46:36.557 --> 00:46:37.725
Mrs. Oates.

514
00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:42.897
Eleanor, Joe, Marissa, Donald...

515
00:46:43.063 --> 00:46:47.151
After the president, the choir sings,
then Matveyev delivers the eulogy.

516
00:46:47.318 --> 00:46:50.529
If your girl tries anything here,
it'd have to be pretty amazing.

517
00:46:54.867 --> 00:46:59.496
I knew he would bring more to the job
than just his years of experience.

518
00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:01.957
As vice president...

519
00:47:02.124 --> 00:47:06.670
...he showed the world the best
of what it is to be an American.

520
00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:08.464
And today...

521
00:47:08.631 --> 00:47:13.385
...the world says goodbye
to a great man.

522
00:47:22.728 --> 00:47:24.355
I'll check the back.

523
00:47:24.521 --> 00:47:27.024
Lima Zulu 4, clear.

524
00:47:52.883 --> 00:47:55.219
<i>My friendship with Maxwell Oates...</i>

525
00:47:55.386 --> 00:47:58.389
...began in the unlikeliest of places:

526
00:47:58.555 --> 00:48:02.059
<i>- Lima Zulu 4, come in.
- Across the negotiating table...</i>

527
00:48:02.226 --> 00:48:04.395
<i>What's your status, Lima Zulu 4?</i>

528
00:48:04.561 --> 00:48:05.771
We got two MIAs.

529
00:48:05.938 --> 00:48:11.068
Lima Zulu 4 in the utility tunnel outside
the crypt entrance and Lima Zulu 5.

530
00:48:11.235 --> 00:48:14.363
I'm heading down to the crypt.
Some kind of trouble down there.

531
00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:16.156
What's going on, guys? Talk to me.

532
00:48:16.323 --> 00:48:19.451
Subunits Lima Zulu 1, 2 and 3,
converge on the crypt. Repeat:

533
00:48:19.618 --> 00:48:20.703
<i>Converge on the crypt.</i>

534
00:48:20.869 --> 00:48:22.913
He made all the difference,
and for that...

535
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.960
...he will always have
my respect and admiration.

536
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:16.759
That is what my friend Maxwell Oates
would have said.

537
00:49:23.557 --> 00:49:24.725
What's going on?

538
00:49:35.569 --> 00:49:37.112
Matveyev.

539
00:49:37.988 --> 00:49:39.156
Get goddamn Matveyev.

540
00:49:54.296 --> 00:49:56.965
- Get the bomb squad in here!
- Go, go!

541
00:50:36.672 --> 00:50:38.382
Drop it!

542
00:50:40.384 --> 00:50:41.426
Drop it!

543
00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:51.645
- Any MTs down here?
- I see her.

544
00:50:51.812 --> 00:50:54.565
- Keep your hands up!
- Shooter's at 12 o'clock.

545
00:50:54.731 --> 00:50:57.985
- Gun! She's got a gun. She has a gun!
- Don't move!

546
00:50:58.152 --> 00:51:00.362
- Do not move! Do not move!
- Keep your hands up!

547
00:51:00.529 --> 00:51:03.574
- Take her down, take her down!
- Check for other weapons.

548
00:51:04.992 --> 00:51:07.202
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

549
00:51:07.369 --> 00:51:09.163
I can't feel a pulse.

550
00:51:10.747 --> 00:51:12.249
Back it up! Back it up!

551
00:51:12.416 --> 00:51:15.377
Come on, guys. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

552
00:51:16.587 --> 00:51:17.796
Let's go, let's go.

553
00:51:18.297 --> 00:51:20.007
Hey, watch this guy, watch this guy.

554
00:51:20.174 --> 00:51:21.216
- Back up!
- Keep moving.

555
00:51:21.383 --> 00:51:22.634
Sir, back up!

556
00:51:22.801 --> 00:51:25.387
Why? Why?!

557
00:51:27.097 --> 00:51:29.850
Do you have any idea
how much blood is on your hands?

558
00:51:30.017 --> 00:51:31.602
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.

559
00:51:31.768 --> 00:51:33.770
I'm gonna see to it personally!
A dark hole!

560
00:51:33.937 --> 00:51:35.439
Get a hold of yourself.

561
00:51:36.106 --> 00:51:37.608
Get the door, get the door.

562
00:51:37.774 --> 00:51:40.444
- Get off me!
- Back off, man! Back off!

563
00:51:40.611 --> 00:51:41.945
That's it. Let's go.

564
00:51:43.071 --> 00:51:44.948
Stand back.

565
00:51:45.657 --> 00:51:48.202
Close it! Go, go, go!

566
00:52:00.464 --> 00:52:03.967
Matveyev was declared dead
en route to the hospital.

567
00:52:04.426 --> 00:52:05.761
Jesus Christ.

568
00:52:06.178 --> 00:52:07.346
Yeah.

569
00:52:07.638 --> 00:52:09.681
You were right about her.

570
00:52:10.641 --> 00:52:13.185
She had the drop on me, Ted.

571
00:52:14.519 --> 00:52:16.271
Why didn't she shoot?

572
00:53:09.741 --> 00:53:12.035
Cop down, cop down! Hear me!

573
00:54:00.334 --> 00:54:04.588
Get out of the car
with your hands on your head!

574
00:54:04.796 --> 00:54:07.591
Right now! Hands in the air!

575
00:54:24.649 --> 00:54:28.320
- Hey, did you see that?
- Hey, get those guys over here.

576
00:54:28.487 --> 00:54:30.781
Get them over here to help.

577
00:54:45.796 --> 00:54:48.382
Somebody help me get him out.
Help me get him out.

578
00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:21.665
<i>What is your name?</i>

579
00:55:21.832 --> 00:55:24.334
<i>My name is Evelyn Salt.</i>

580
00:55:24.501 --> 00:55:26.211
What college will you attend?

581
00:55:26.378 --> 00:55:28.255
Princeton University.

582
00:55:28.422 --> 00:55:31.508
- Where will you work?
- The Central Intelligence Agency.

583
00:55:31.675 --> 00:55:33.677
Who will you trust?

584
00:55:33.844 --> 00:55:35.554
No one.

585
00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.098
Be very patient.

586
00:55:38.265 --> 00:55:40.016
Remember your training.

587
00:55:40.934 --> 00:55:44.187
Remember, you're not the only one.

588
00:55:44.354 --> 00:55:45.939
There are many others.

589
00:55:46.106 --> 00:55:49.401
All of you waiting to strike.

590
00:55:49.568 --> 00:55:51.695
- Yes.
- And we will strike.

591
00:55:52.362 --> 00:55:55.532
- Together.
- Yes.

592
00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.619
Wait.

593
00:56:02.372 --> 00:56:06.293
One day, I will come for all of you.

594
00:56:12.382 --> 00:56:14.176
Hello, Evelyn.

595
00:56:14.509 --> 00:56:17.679
I'm Martin Crenshaw
from the U.S. Embassy.

596
00:56:18.346 --> 00:56:21.725
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

597
00:56:28.815 --> 00:56:32.652
<i>Rioters outside the U.S. Embassy
cheered their new leader's words...</i>

598
00:56:32.819 --> 00:56:36.323
<i>...and called on him to take strong
action against what they are calling...</i>

599
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:38.241
<i>...a state-sponsored act of terrorism...</i>

600
00:56:38.742 --> 00:56:40.202
<i>...on the part of the U.S.</i>

601
00:56:40.368 --> 00:56:42.412
<i>These riots are sparking
similar outbreaks...</i>

602
00:56:42.579 --> 00:56:45.749
<i>...of anti-American protests
across Russia.</i>

603
00:56:45.916 --> 00:56:49.085
<i>"We will strike back,"
says the new Russian president...</i>

604
00:56:49.252 --> 00:56:51.671
<i>...angrily condemning
today's assassination...</i>

605
00:56:51.838 --> 00:56:55.300
<i>...by American intelligence officer
Evelyn Salt.</i>

606
00:56:55.884 --> 00:56:59.471
<i>As the body of slain President Matveyev
is on its way back to Moscow...</i>

607
00:56:59.638 --> 00:57:02.224
<i>...anti-American riots
have erupted across Russia...</i>

608
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:05.101
<i>...with bombings of U.S. diplomats'
cars in Moscow.</i>

609
00:57:06.436 --> 00:57:09.356
<i>The Russian armed forces
have been put on high alert.</i>

610
00:57:09.814 --> 00:57:12.567
<i>Responding to
a rapidly escalating crisis...</i>

611
00:57:12.734 --> 00:57:15.946
<i>...President Lewis has called for
an emergency White House meeting...</i>

612
00:57:16.112 --> 00:57:19.533
<i>...with cabinet members, military
leaders and NATO representatives.</i>

613
00:57:19.699 --> 00:57:22.619
Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

614
00:57:28.792 --> 00:57:31.711
When I saw you in Washington,
I almost ran to you.

615
00:57:39.135 --> 00:57:41.846
You were not supposed
to get married.

616
00:57:42.013 --> 00:57:46.434
Not unless it had
great tactical advantage.

617
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:48.311
I did it to seem normal.

618
00:57:49.145 --> 00:57:51.147
When you escaped today, I thought:

619
00:57:51.314 --> 00:57:55.485
"Even I could not have hoped
for so much."

620
00:57:55.902 --> 00:57:59.531
You are my greatest creation.

621
00:58:00.699 --> 00:58:02.867
You trained me well.

622
00:58:39.362 --> 00:58:42.490
My husband, you have him?

623
00:58:42.657 --> 00:58:45.035
I had to be certain.

624
00:58:45.201 --> 00:58:47.287
But now you trust me?

625
00:58:47.454 --> 00:58:48.496
Completely.

626
00:58:56.713 --> 00:58:58.214
So...

627
00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:00.634
...tell me what's next.

628
00:59:00.884 --> 00:59:03.136
Next, part two:

629
00:59:03.637 --> 00:59:07.641
We seize control of
this country's atomic weapons.

630
00:59:08.558 --> 00:59:09.934
How?

631
00:59:10.644 --> 00:59:11.728
You'll see.

632
00:59:13.063 --> 00:59:14.314
All right.

633
01:00:28.555 --> 01:00:30.807
Satisfied?

634
01:00:32.308 --> 01:00:33.560
I'm satisfied.

635
01:00:35.311 --> 01:00:36.688
Comrades...

636
01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:40.650
...our sister has rejoined us.

637
01:00:40.984 --> 01:00:44.112
Russia will rise from the ashes...

638
01:00:44.279 --> 01:00:47.741
...of the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

639
01:00:49.451 --> 01:00:51.536
And the world will hear us!

640
01:00:52.203 --> 01:00:53.413
Will hear.

641
01:00:56.374 --> 01:00:58.251
Welcome back to our family, sister.

642
01:01:01.171 --> 01:01:02.213
Sister.

643
01:01:09.679 --> 01:01:15.643
Russia has changed.
But our lives will not be wasted.

644
01:01:17.479 --> 01:01:22.066
You're to meet an agent, NATO uniform,
at a plane here.

645
01:01:22.817 --> 01:01:28.198
Tail number N182SL.

646
01:01:29.574 --> 01:01:33.745
Final instructions will come from him.

647
01:01:35.038 --> 01:01:37.040
- That's it.
- That's it.

648
01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:40.251
After this, we go dark.

649
01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.046
Radio silent.

650
01:01:44.047 --> 01:01:45.840
You won't hear from me again...

651
01:01:46.382 --> 01:01:47.675
...my daughter.

652
01:03:44.208 --> 01:03:46.628
Forever and ever.

653
01:04:09.943 --> 01:04:11.569
Have you heard from Orlov?

654
01:04:12.487 --> 01:04:14.697
Yes. Last word was "go."

655
01:04:19.494 --> 01:04:21.204
Chenkov.

656
01:04:22.747 --> 01:04:24.374
Do you remember me?

657
01:04:29.712 --> 01:04:30.838
<i>Chenkov.</i>

658
01:04:32.215 --> 01:04:33.883
Did you miss me?

659
01:04:34.425 --> 01:04:35.635
Shnaider?

660
01:04:40.181 --> 01:04:41.474
How long have you been here?

661
01:04:43.893 --> 01:04:47.939
I left Russia one year after you.
To Prague.

662
01:04:48.189 --> 01:04:51.818
I've been the NATO liaison
to the White House for three years.

663
01:04:52.235 --> 01:04:54.904
Colonel Edward Tomas.

664
01:04:55.238 --> 01:04:58.408
And you are my attaché.

665
01:04:58.574 --> 01:05:00.243
Your ID.

666
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:03.246
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

667
01:05:03.413 --> 01:05:06.332
More importantly, our mission.

668
01:05:06.708 --> 01:05:11.129
The bunker eight stories
below the White House.

669
01:05:13.089 --> 01:05:14.841
That's where the president
needs to be.

670
01:05:20.096 --> 01:05:21.264
How do we do it?

671
01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:25.518
Don't worry, he'll be there.
That's my job. I'll make sure he's there.

672
01:05:26.352 --> 01:05:29.814
- What's my job?
- Do you remember, Chenkov...

673
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:33.735
...when we were young and you
had to finish first in everything?

674
01:05:33.901 --> 01:05:35.653
Had to be the best at everything.

675
01:05:35.862 --> 01:05:39.866
Though you knew you would be beaten
with a cane, you had to finish first.

676
01:05:40.033 --> 01:05:41.617
I remember.

677
01:05:41.784 --> 01:05:45.288
Tonight you will finish
ahead of me again.

678
01:05:47.999 --> 01:05:52.295
Tonight you will kill
America's president.

679
01:06:05.141 --> 01:06:06.976
IDs, please.

680
01:06:07.643 --> 01:06:09.771
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

681
01:06:10.146 --> 01:06:11.189
I'll check the side.

682
01:06:14.942 --> 01:06:15.985
Control, this is Hayes.

683
01:06:16.152 --> 01:06:19.030
I have a Colonel Tomas
and a Major Vicek.

684
01:06:19.197 --> 01:06:20.531
Undercarriage is clean.

685
01:06:21.824 --> 01:06:22.825
Back's clean.

686
01:06:24.243 --> 01:06:27.455
Colonel. Major. All clear.

687
01:06:39.509 --> 01:06:41.177
You know the drill, colonel.

688
01:06:43.137 --> 01:06:45.723
Shrapnel. A Serbian landmine.

689
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:48.893
They've spent more time looking at it
than the doctor did.

690
01:06:52.396 --> 01:06:54.524
Step through, please, sir.

691
01:06:58.444 --> 01:06:59.612
Turn around.

692
01:07:03.074 --> 01:07:04.700
Thank you.

693
01:07:09.205 --> 01:07:11.958
- Step through. Arms out.
- Patience is key.

694
01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:15.211
I've been coming here for two years,
others have been here longer.

695
01:07:15.378 --> 01:07:17.713
- What others?
- I don't know.

696
01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.050
But you were the best of us
and I was the least.

697
01:07:21.217 --> 01:07:24.679
There must be others,
here to finish what we begin.

698
01:07:24.846 --> 01:07:26.556
Colonel Tomas.
Good to see you again.

699
01:07:26.722 --> 01:07:27.932
- Major Vicek.
- Pleasure.

700
01:07:28.099 --> 01:07:31.018
You'll have minutes to preview NATO's
point of view before the meeting.

701
01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.356
Now, Ted, your Russian
CI agent, Salt.

702
01:07:35.523 --> 01:07:38.860
- What can you tell us about her?
- We think she may be a Soviet plant...

703
01:07:39.902 --> 01:07:44.740
...inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB called Day X.

704
01:07:44.907 --> 01:07:49.078
A day marking the start of a large
strike against the U.S. and her allies.

705
01:07:56.586 --> 01:07:58.838
This should be the president now.

706
01:08:01.757 --> 01:08:03.968
You have a big job, Chenkov...

707
01:08:04.135 --> 01:08:05.428
...but you can do it.

708
01:08:05.761 --> 01:08:07.930
You still haven't told me
what your job is.

709
01:08:08.222 --> 01:08:09.974
Home.

710
01:08:10.266 --> 01:08:11.726
I'm going home.

711
01:08:15.438 --> 01:08:17.732
- Down! Take cover!
- Get the president!

712
01:08:18.357 --> 01:08:20.359
- A gun! He's got a gun!
- Get back!

713
01:08:21.694 --> 01:08:22.904
Get back!

714
01:08:36.375 --> 01:08:37.543
- Are you okay, sir?
- Yes.

715
01:08:37.710 --> 01:08:40.213
- Goddamn it.
- Geronimo is SOP, downward mobile.

716
01:08:45.968 --> 01:08:47.094
Help, over here!

717
01:08:49.347 --> 01:08:51.474
Get a medic! Get a medic!

718
01:08:58.648 --> 01:09:00.775
I think I saw her.

719
01:09:01.192 --> 01:09:02.818
You saw who?

720
01:09:04.654 --> 01:09:06.072
Salt.

721
01:09:07.198 --> 01:09:08.824
I think I saw her in the corridor.

722
01:09:11.327 --> 01:09:12.870
The other NATO officer.

723
01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:17.500
She's here.

724
01:09:19.001 --> 01:09:20.169
Check.

725
01:09:20.336 --> 01:09:21.712
- Clear.
- Move.

726
01:09:22.421 --> 01:09:23.464
Go!

727
01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:26.217
We may have a visual
on a second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

728
01:09:26.384 --> 01:09:29.553
Repeat: Evelyn Salt on premises.
May be dressed as a NATO officer.

729
01:09:30.513 --> 01:09:34.016
<i>This is not a drill.
The White House is under attack.</i>

730
01:09:34.183 --> 01:09:38.062
<i>If you are near an exit, please
proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

731
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:40.022
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

732
01:09:40.523 --> 01:09:42.858
I need this hallway cleared
to the left, now!

733
01:09:44.193 --> 01:09:47.154
Command, this is Jenks. I need
the PEOC bunker up and running.

734
01:09:47.321 --> 01:09:49.699
If this was authorized
by the Russian government...

735
01:09:49.865 --> 01:09:52.410
...it is an act of war,
and we will respond.

736
01:09:53.703 --> 01:09:57.832
<i>If you are near an exit, please
proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

737
01:09:57.999 --> 01:09:59.917
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

738
01:10:00.084 --> 01:10:01.752
- Clear!
- Let's go, sir.

739
01:10:04.463 --> 01:10:06.048
Alpha team!

740
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.387
Move, move.

741
01:10:12.054 --> 01:10:13.389
Close it.

742
01:10:13.723 --> 01:10:15.057
Close it.

743
01:10:22.356 --> 01:10:25.067
<i>Please proceed outside
in an orderly manner.</i>

744
01:10:25.234 --> 01:10:27.320
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

745
01:10:58.392 --> 01:10:59.810
Go, go.

746
01:11:01.729 --> 01:11:04.273
Geronimo approaching bunker door
in five seconds.

747
01:11:09.028 --> 01:11:10.404
Clear.

748
01:11:18.412 --> 01:11:19.663
Any chance she could follow?

749
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:21.916
My own men couldn't
get through that door.

750
01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:24.752
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
she isn't one of yours.

751
01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:30.132
Okay, go.

752
01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:33.636
Stay until it's shut and sealed.

753
01:11:37.556 --> 01:11:39.517
Geronimo secured.

754
01:12:07.962 --> 01:12:09.964
- Get me Director Medford.
- Yes, sir.

755
01:12:10.881 --> 01:12:13.843
Sir, I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility...

756
01:12:14.009 --> 01:12:16.887
...that today, right now,
could be the start of Day X.

757
01:12:17.596 --> 01:12:20.099
Mr. President,
Director Medford is up.

758
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:22.852
Marion, what's the situation?

759
01:12:23.018 --> 01:12:26.021
<i>It should be coming up
on one of your screens.</i>

760
01:12:26.564 --> 01:12:28.858
<i>What you see there
represents temperature drops...</i>

761
01:12:29.024 --> 01:12:31.193
<i>...in mobile missile units in Siberia.</i>

762
01:12:31.694 --> 01:12:35.197
<i>It means the Russians are deploying
their missiles to the field.</i>

763
01:12:35.364 --> 01:12:38.951
<i>And that's been confirmed
on the ground, Mr. President.</i>

764
01:12:40.119 --> 01:12:43.622
Mr. President, I strongly recommend
we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

765
01:12:43.789 --> 01:12:46.208
At least at our forward bases.

766
01:12:47.877 --> 01:12:49.003
Do it.

767
01:12:49.503 --> 01:12:51.547
And since the Russians
have deployed...

768
01:12:52.339 --> 01:12:55.468
...we need to look at
our own nuclear attack options.

769
01:12:55.885 --> 01:12:58.721
It's not on the table,
it's not a deterrent.

770
01:13:00.389 --> 01:13:02.766
Thanks, Marion.
We'll come back to you.

771
01:13:23.037 --> 01:13:24.580
Sir.

772
01:13:27.583 --> 01:13:30.711
The outer portal door is jammed.
No response.

773
01:13:30.878 --> 01:13:33.631
And we just lost the feed
from most of our security cameras.

774
01:13:33.797 --> 01:13:36.425
We're blind down here
and no one can enter this facility.

775
01:13:36.592 --> 01:13:40.721
Command, our eyes are down. We have
a PEOC outer security door malfunction.

776
01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.848
Get out there now.

777
01:13:43.015 --> 01:13:44.892
Seal this room.

778
01:13:46.977 --> 01:13:48.562
Down that corridor. Secure it.

779
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:36.318
<i>Victims are being taken to
George Washington Hospital.</i>

780
01:14:36.485 --> 01:14:40.531
<i>Reports are coming in that there
are casualties at the White House.</i>

781
01:14:42.032 --> 01:14:43.784
This is President Howard Lewis.

782
01:14:43.951 --> 01:14:47.788
<i>- Proceed with authentication.</i>
- Yes, Mr. President.

783
01:14:52.001 --> 01:14:55.045
- Ready to commence authentication.
- Zulu.

784
01:14:55.212 --> 01:14:56.297
- Tango.
- Echo.

785
01:14:56.463 --> 01:14:57.464
- Seven.
- Niner.

786
01:14:57.631 --> 01:14:58.841
- Juliett.
<i>- X-ray.</i>

787
01:14:59.008 --> 01:15:00.009
<i>- Sierra.
- Seven.</i>

788
01:15:00.175 --> 01:15:01.176
<i>- Alfa.</i>
- Mike.

789
01:15:01.343 --> 01:15:03.012
- Charlie.
- Whiskey.

790
01:15:03.178 --> 01:15:04.221
<i>- Five.
- Six.</i>

791
01:15:04.388 --> 01:15:07.474
<i>- Tango.
- Authentication codes confirmed.</i>

792
01:15:08.183 --> 01:15:10.019
<i>It's all yours now, Mr. President.</i>

793
01:15:10.644 --> 01:15:11.895
God be with you.

794
01:15:13.689 --> 01:15:16.734
Attack options and targeting
under your control, Mr. President.

795
01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.861
Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?

796
01:15:19.987 --> 01:15:22.281
<i>Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?</i>

797
01:15:23.991 --> 01:15:26.910
Is the camera outside
this door working? Put it up.

798
01:15:27.077 --> 01:15:29.121
Officer Dryer, what's your status?

799
01:15:30.789 --> 01:15:31.874
Officer Dryer, come in.

800
01:15:32.541 --> 01:15:37.046
<i>Federal Communication Commission is
activating the Emergency Alert System.</i>

801
01:15:37.212 --> 01:15:38.797
Who the hell's that?

802
01:15:39.715 --> 01:15:42.509
That's her. That's Evelyn Salt.

803
01:15:42.676 --> 01:15:44.219
She's in. Go to DEFCON 1.

804
01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.055
Give me your side arm.

805
01:15:46.221 --> 01:15:49.725
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
firearms in the president's vicinity.

806
01:15:49.892 --> 01:15:51.644
Screw protocol.
We got an enemy agent.

807
01:15:51.810 --> 01:15:53.771
Protocol is protocol, sir.

808
01:15:54.104 --> 01:15:56.940
And dead is dead.

809
01:15:57.691 --> 01:15:59.360
Behind me!

810
01:16:00.736 --> 01:16:02.446
I'm the national security adviser.

811
01:16:02.905 --> 01:16:03.947
Not anymore.

812
01:16:11.872 --> 01:16:12.915
Sit down.

813
01:16:16.251 --> 01:16:17.294
Who are you?

814
01:16:17.836 --> 01:16:20.798
My name, Mr. President,
is Nikolai Tarkovsky.

815
01:16:22.049 --> 01:16:24.551
And unless you do exactly as I say...

816
01:16:24.885 --> 01:16:27.262
...I will be the last person
you will ever see.

817
01:16:33.268 --> 01:16:35.646
Shall we look at some
selective attack options?

818
01:16:35.938 --> 01:16:37.272
Go to hell.

819
01:17:05.759 --> 01:17:09.012
<i>Selective attack options ready.</i>

820
01:17:09.221 --> 01:17:10.639
Ted?

821
01:17:10.806 --> 01:17:15.936
<i>Emergency action message
released by...</i>

822
01:17:16.395 --> 01:17:19.565
Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
You made it.

823
01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:21.859
Why didn't you tell me?

824
01:17:24.611 --> 01:17:26.655
I tried many times, but...

825
01:17:27.406 --> 01:17:30.200
My loneliness was my only friend.

826
01:17:30.367 --> 01:17:33.078
You weren't with us in Russia.
I would have remembered you.

827
01:17:33.245 --> 01:17:35.205
I was a class ahead, comrade.

828
01:17:35.664 --> 01:17:37.666
The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.

829
01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:40.753
And now it's my honor
to launch the attack.

830
01:17:41.128 --> 01:17:42.671
Excuse me.

831
01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:46.884
<i>Selective attack targets acquired.</i>

832
01:17:48.177 --> 01:17:49.678
<i>Tehran.</i>

833
01:17:50.012 --> 01:17:51.430
<i>Mecca.</i>

834
01:17:52.181 --> 01:17:55.225
Mecca? Tehran?

835
01:17:55.392 --> 01:17:57.060
Part two of our plan.

836
01:17:57.227 --> 01:17:59.188
Kill nine million people.

837
01:17:59.897 --> 01:18:01.356
Enrage a billion Muslims.

838
01:18:02.357 --> 01:18:04.359
America will suffer a painful death.

839
01:18:04.526 --> 01:18:07.529
<i>Permissive action links initiated.</i>

840
01:18:09.948 --> 01:18:12.576
<i>Missiles arming.</i>

841
01:18:18.874 --> 01:18:21.210
<i>Nuclear command.</i> ..

842
01:18:21.543 --> 01:18:24.213
<i>...posts airborne.</i>

843
01:18:24.379 --> 01:18:25.714
Let me join you.

844
01:18:27.132 --> 01:18:30.052
<i>ICBMs set to...</i>

845
01:18:30.427 --> 01:18:32.679
<i>...maximum yield.</i>

846
01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.975
You know, when you first came
to Langley...

847
01:18:37.726 --> 01:18:40.187
...I didn't think I'd be able
to do it.

848
01:18:41.313 --> 01:18:43.273
I didn't think I'd be able to...

849
01:18:44.024 --> 01:18:46.985
...resist the temptation
to say something.

850
01:18:47.194 --> 01:18:49.988
Then you met Mike and...

851
01:18:50.489 --> 01:18:51.949
...well...

852
01:18:52.491 --> 01:18:54.409
...things changed.

853
01:18:57.496 --> 01:18:58.789
Let me join you.

854
01:19:00.165 --> 01:19:04.253
All these years right in front of me
and I never knew.

855
01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:12.594
Let me join you.

856
01:19:13.512 --> 01:19:15.472
I want to be with you.

857
01:19:28.277 --> 01:19:31.613
<i>The man we thought was dead has
made a resurrection that is miraculous.</i>

858
01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.490
<i>President Matveyev is alive.</i>

859
01:19:33.657 --> 01:19:35.784
<i>We're going to Russia.
What you are seeing...</i>

860
01:19:35.951 --> 01:19:38.412
<i>...are live pictures of
Russian president Matveyev...</i>

861
01:19:38.579 --> 01:19:42.457
<i>...arriving at the airport outside
of Moscow. This is astonishing.</i>

862
01:19:42.624 --> 01:19:45.836
<i>According to his doctors,
President Matveyev's mistaken death...</i>

863
01:19:46.003 --> 01:19:48.380
<i>...is attributed to
a temporary paralysis...</i>

864
01:19:48.547 --> 01:19:51.091
<i>...from a toxin
derived from spider venom.</i>

865
01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:55.304
<i>A recap for those who may not have
been following the events of the day...</i>

866
01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.726
At least I was right.

867
01:20:03.604 --> 01:20:07.107
I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.

868
01:20:07.399 --> 01:20:11.153
I could see how moved you were
by Mike's little white-knight routine.

869
01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.488
You were supposed to
recruit him, Ev...

870
01:20:13.655 --> 01:20:15.282
...not fall in love with him.

871
01:20:16.491 --> 01:20:18.660
That's why I told Orlov
to pick him up.

872
01:20:21.163 --> 01:20:23.373
By the way, how is Mike?

873
01:20:25.334 --> 01:20:27.461
Orlov is dead.

874
01:20:31.924 --> 01:20:34.176
Well, that's good news.

875
01:20:34.468 --> 01:20:35.886
Saved me the trouble.

876
01:20:37.596 --> 01:20:42.017
I had to practically twist his arm to
get him to blow your cover at the CIA.

877
01:20:43.810 --> 01:20:47.314
You see, he wanted you
to come out of this thing alive.

878
01:20:50.651 --> 01:20:52.778
But you needed somebody
to take the blame.

879
01:20:53.987 --> 01:20:56.031
I'm the patsy.

880
01:20:59.368 --> 01:21:01.703
And I'm the hero.

881
01:21:04.039 --> 01:21:06.375
Congratulations, Ev.

882
01:21:08.043 --> 01:21:10.587
You're about to become famous.

01:23:17.672 --> 01:23:18.799
Go!

<i>Permission to launch.</i>

894
01:23:55.043 --> 01:23:56.378
Get down on the floor, now!

895
01:23:57.170 --> 01:23:58.547
I said now!

896
01:24:03.552 --> 01:24:06.513
<i>Launch sequence aborted.
Systems restored.</i>

897
01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:08.557
- Move, move, move!
- Show me your hands!

898
01:24:08.723 --> 01:24:10.517
- Get down!
- What is your name, sir?

899
01:24:10.684 --> 01:24:14.020
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the president.

900
01:24:15.522 --> 01:24:17.399
Mr. President.

901
01:24:18.859 --> 01:24:21.153
Mr. President, can you hear me?

902
01:24:22.946 --> 01:24:24.406
- Hold still.
- EMT's on the way.

903
01:24:24.573 --> 01:24:26.700
Make sure they got body bags.
At least seven.

904
01:24:26.867 --> 01:24:28.410
She's wearing a vest.

905
01:24:28.952 --> 01:24:31.580
I'll meet you in five minutes.
I wanna get cleaned up.

906
01:24:31.746 --> 01:24:33.331
And I want her alone in a room.

907
01:24:33.498 --> 01:24:35.959
If there are other KAs out there,
I want her talking.

908
01:24:36.168 --> 01:24:39.754
She won't talk. She's trained not to,
no matter what we do to her.

909
01:24:39.921 --> 01:24:42.215
If we're gonna find these people,
we gotta do it.

910
01:24:42.382 --> 01:24:44.593
Somebody already did.
At least some of them.

911
01:24:44.759 --> 01:24:47.637
Barge on the East River.
Twelve dead, including Orlov.

912
01:24:48.054 --> 01:24:49.472
Who did that?

913
01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.602
Don't know. Forensics are on it.

914
01:25:01.067 --> 01:25:03.945
No one comes through until
the president is secure. Step back.

915
01:25:04.112 --> 01:25:06.364
- I'm Theodore Winter...
- Step back, sir. Please.

916
01:25:10.202 --> 01:25:14.456
Well, sir, you're injured. Why don't you
have a seat? We'll take a look at you.

917
01:25:15.123 --> 01:25:16.833
Are you okay?

918
01:25:17.667 --> 01:25:20.045
Pretty good gash there.

919
01:25:20.212 --> 01:25:22.797
Looks like you got a piece of glass
in there.

920
01:25:44.819 --> 01:25:45.987
<i>She killed someone else.</i>

921
01:25:46.154 --> 01:25:49.282
<i>It's Winter. It's Ted Winter, sir.
You better get up here.</i>

922
01:25:58.625 --> 01:26:00.502
Check him. Check him!

923
01:26:01.336 --> 01:26:02.337
Checking Vitals.

924
01:26:02.504 --> 01:26:05.340
I'm not getting a pulse.
I'm not getting much.

925
01:26:28.488 --> 01:26:30.156
Sit down.

926
01:26:31.408 --> 01:26:33.952
She's yours for 15 minutes
during the flight.

927
01:26:34.119 --> 01:26:36.538
- Give me your hands.
- Then she's the FBI's.

928
01:27:21.124 --> 01:27:22.709
Hey.

929
01:27:23.752 --> 01:27:25.337
Why'd you kill him?

930
01:27:25.628 --> 01:27:27.088
Because somebody had to.

931
01:27:40.602 --> 01:27:41.728
What?!

932
01:27:52.739 --> 01:27:55.658
By this, I take it you think
everybody is who they say they are.

933
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:59.454
You knew something was wrong
the moment Orlov walked in.

934
01:27:59.621 --> 01:28:01.081
So did I.

935
01:28:01.247 --> 01:28:03.541
We just didn't know what it was.

936
01:28:03.958 --> 01:28:06.961
- Winter did.
- Winter?

937
01:28:08.838 --> 01:28:12.050
You expect me to believe that Winter
was gonna launch the missiles...

938
01:28:12.217 --> 01:28:14.135
...and you saved the world?

939
01:28:15.762 --> 01:28:18.431
I would like you
to believe that, yeah.

940
01:28:20.266 --> 01:28:21.810
That's a big accusation.

941
01:28:22.977 --> 01:28:24.312
Well...

942
01:28:25.397 --> 01:28:28.191
...he's dead now
so he can't defend himself.

943
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:31.653
I guess you'll just have to
decide for yourself.

944
01:28:38.827 --> 01:28:40.787
How many more like you are there?

945
01:28:41.329 --> 01:28:43.039
Like me?

946
01:28:44.124 --> 01:28:45.875
None.

947
01:28:46.501 --> 01:28:47.961
Like him?

948
01:28:48.128 --> 01:28:50.505
More than you or I can handle alone.

949
01:28:53.174 --> 01:28:55.885
You really think
a trained Soviet agent...

950
01:28:56.052 --> 01:29:00.640
...couldn't kill the Russian president
at point-blank range if she wanted to?

951
01:29:04.769 --> 01:29:07.021
Or you, for that matter.

952
01:29:07.730 --> 01:29:10.024
I could've killed you at the funeral
and I didn't.

953
01:29:10.525 --> 01:29:13.069
You surrendered to me
because I gave you no choice.

954
01:29:13.236 --> 01:29:15.155
You know better.

955
01:29:16.156 --> 01:29:18.408
I had a choice.

956
01:29:19.033 --> 01:29:20.201
You know better.

957
01:29:40.388 --> 01:29:42.682
If I did believe you...

958
01:29:42.849 --> 01:29:46.644
...and I'm not saying for a second
that I do, but if I did...

959
01:29:48.563 --> 01:29:50.273
...nobody else would.

960
01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:55.111
Well, maybe you can
think of a way around that.

961
01:30:06.414 --> 01:30:09.000
They took everything from me.

962
01:30:10.752 --> 01:30:12.545
I'll kill them.

963
01:30:26.601 --> 01:30:28.937
ETA, four minutes.

964
01:30:35.985 --> 01:30:37.070
Bullshit!

965
01:30:49.499 --> 01:30:52.794
We are approaching the Potomac,
heading due south and west.

966
01:30:58.466 --> 01:31:00.134
Go get them.

967
01:31:20.488 --> 01:31:21.614
Salt!

968
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:33.751
Circle back! Circle back!

969
01:39:55.352 --> 01:39:57.353
English
