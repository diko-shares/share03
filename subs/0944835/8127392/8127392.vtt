00:09:44.555 --> 00:09:47.767
I came here to tell you a story.

2
00:09:48.685 --> 00:09:50.478
I don't like stories.

3
00:09:50.895 --> 00:09:53.439
But I'll listen anyway.

4
00:57:19.699 --> 00:57:22.619
Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

5
00:59:10.644 --> 00:59:11.728
You'll see.

6
00:59:13.063 --> 00:59:14.314
All right.

7
01:00:28.555 --> 01:00:30.807
Satisfied?

8
01:00:32.308 --> 01:00:33.560
I'm satisfied.

9
01:00:35.311 --> 01:00:36.688
Comrades...

10
01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:40.650
...our sister has rejoined us.

11
01:00:40.984 --> 01:00:44.112
Russia will rise from the ashes...

12
01:00:44.279 --> 01:00:47.741
...of the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

13
01:00:49.451 --> 01:00:51.536
And the world will hear us!

14
01:00:52.203 --> 01:00:53.413
Will hear.

15
01:00:56.374 --> 01:00:58.251
Welcome back to our family, sister.

16
01:01:01.171 --> 01:01:02.213
Sister.

17
01:01:09.679 --> 01:01:15.643
Russia has changed.
But our lives will not be wasted.

18
01:01:17.479 --> 01:01:22.066
You're to meet an agent, NATO uniform,
at a plane here.

19
01:01:22.817 --> 01:01:28.198
Tail number N182SL.

20
01:01:29.574 --> 01:01:33.745
Final instructions will come from him.

21
01:01:35.038 --> 01:01:37.040
- That's it.
- That's it.

22
01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:40.251
After this, we go dark.

23
01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.046
Radio silent.

24
01:04:09.943 --> 01:04:11.569
Have you heard from Orlov?

25
01:04:12.487 --> 01:04:14.697
Yes. Last word was "go."

26
01:17:16.395 --> 01:17:19.565
Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
You made it.

27
01:17:24.611 --> 01:17:26.655
I tried many times, but...

28
01:17:27.406 --> 01:17:30.200
My loneliness was my only friend.

29
01:17:33.245 --> 01:17:35.205
I was a class ahead, comrade.

30
01:17:35.664 --> 01:17:37.666
The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.

31
01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:40.753
And now it's my honor
to launch the attack.

32
01:17:41.128 --> 01:17:42.671
Excuse me.

33
01:17:55.392 --> 01:17:57.060
Part two of our plan.

34
01:17:57.227 --> 01:17:59.188
Kill nine million people.

35
01:17:59.897 --> 01:18:01.356
Enrage a billion Muslims.

36
01:18:02.357 --> 01:18:04.359
America will suffer a painful death.

37
01:18:24.379 --> 01:18:25.714
Let me join you.

38
01:18:57.496 --> 01:18:58.789
Let me join you.

39
01:19:00.165 --> 01:19:04.253
All these years right in front of me
and I never knew.

40
01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:12.594
Let me join you.

41
01:19:13.512 --> 01:19:15.472
I want to be with you.

42
01:39:55.352 --> 01:39:57.353
