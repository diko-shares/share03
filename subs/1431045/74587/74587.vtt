19
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,670
She's not your type.

20
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,130
She seemed friendly enough.

21
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:49,006
You know why you're here.

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,341

You ain't had nothing like th.

44
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,571
It's biblical.

45
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,801
End of Days, we're talking here.

Buckle up, son, 'cause this shit.

I got some questions.

54
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,312
And you best come correct.

55
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,635
Someone's using Sleep'sphone t.

56
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,012
It's gotta be Neckbone, right?

57
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,639
- Could be Winters.

00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,016
They obviously know what we d.

59
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,379
The phone doesn't proveanythin.

60
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,270
Whoever it is, they're testing.

61
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:10,564
Then it's better for usnot to.

62
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,399
It's "us" now?

63
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,735
We may have madethe body,

64
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,736
but you're the reason he's dead.

65
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,487
It doesn't matter who did what.

66
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,614
We're in this together.

67
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,948

I never should'velet you take.

It was the right play.

71
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:31,293
Listen...

72
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:34,379

Can you use your resourcesand t?

74
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,007
How the hell do I do that

75
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,843
without the Bureauasking questi?

76
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,888
Call in a favor, twist an arm.

77
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,252
I don't care how. Just get it do.

78
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,726
I'm tired of saying this.

79
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,872
I don't work for you, Hammond.

80
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:52,064
This ain't aboutwho's in charg.

81
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,376
This is about all of us staying.

82
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Including you.

83
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,513
Frank, what's up?

00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,891
Scally's. 6:00 PM.

85
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:28,475
Well, should I beworried about?

86
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,353
It's hard to say.

87
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:32,397
I hope not.

88
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,465
What is it?

89
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,509
Hey, there he is!

90
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,923
You remember Kate, don't you?

91
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,598
I do.-Look.

92
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,267
I gotta take this call.

93
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,184
I'll be back in a second.

94
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,289
You two talkamongst yourselves.

95
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,313
Alright?

96
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:17,983
Any idea what this is about?

97
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,655
His exwife just passed.

98
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,282
Wait, Allison's dead?

99
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:26,533
When? How?

100
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,368
I'm not really sure.

101
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,162
You knew her?

102
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:34,833
Well, yeah, we all grew up int.

103
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,293
How 'bout you? Where are you fro?

104

Monterey.

105
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,339
I spent a few months up th.

106
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,423
Which part?

107
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,008
The nice part.

108
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,389
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,975
Forget it. I'd rather not?

110
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,436
You want to tell us how it ha?

111
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,981
She's not really dead, is she?

112
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:00,317
Technically, no.

113
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,985
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

114
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,404
She was dead to me the moment.

115
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,865
Hey, which was exactlyfive year.

116
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,189
You're a real piece of work, ?

117
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,817
Hey, divorce is like a death.

118
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,433
You guys hungry? They make a gre.

119
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,998
No, they don't.

120
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,172
Dr. Barnes, di.

121
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,425

122
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,386
You should be at home, Ma.

123
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,720
I feel fine.

124
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,597
Why won't they let me see him?

125
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,556
He's still in custody.

126
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
It's a security issue.

127
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,518
Secur... my God!

128
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,685
What am I gonna do?

129
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,978
Bust him out with my purse?

130
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,606
How does he look?

131
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,730
Doctor said he was lucky.

132
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,359
He's stable for right now.

133
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:44,611
I'll never understandthe choic.

134
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,114
Okay, it wasn't a choice.

135
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,490
He's a cop in jail. That makes h.

136
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,867
Don't sugarcoat it.

I know the manand the life he l.

138
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,247
He makes enemies, not friends.

139
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,666
God.

140
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,042
Ma, you should go getsomething?

141
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,795

143
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,008
Go on.-Make them let me see him?

144
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,288
I swear to you, I had no part i.

145
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,603
No part.

146
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,958
Well, maybe it'sa good thing h,

147
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:23,525
'cause there's no way I would've.

148
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,819
Well, we're here now,

149
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,905
and makingthe most of it, right?

150
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,269
It's surprisinglynot that pain.

151
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,034
No, that's not what I!

152
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,662
That... that came out completely.

153
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:36,872
What I meant is I'm just...

154
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,498
I'm not the typeof person that, ,

155
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,459
that goes out a lot.

156
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,502
Well, same here.

157
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,241
But in this case, the company he.

158
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:47,966
Frank, um...

159
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,510
thinks pretty highly of you, ?

160
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:51,554
Frank's a good guy.

161
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,015
What?-

162
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,019

Well, how's he doing? Did he cl?

164
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,986
How about you, um, get me anoth?

165
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,415
Thanks.

166
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,459
You're welcome.

00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,047
She ever finds outyou were in o.

168
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,837
Hey, I just wanted a shot.

169
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,968
If she's gonna reject me,

170
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,054
I'd rather it be becauseshe got.

171
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,102
I don't think anybody'sever se.

172

Listen, does she talk to youmu?

173
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,316
No, why?

174
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,111
Just seemed a little evasive.

175
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,475
Maybe she thinksyou're one of.

176
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:54,991
You think aboutwhat we just did,

177
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,035

He's locked up.-Make an excepti.

186
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Just a few minutes.

00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,359

188
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,321

Okay?

You see?

194
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:47,792
Was that so difficult, man?

195
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:50,673
She can get five minutes.

196
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,891
All I'm asking is thatyou ping.

197
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,644

00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:15,778
It has to be off the books.

Sorry, but I gota family to th.

What?

209
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,647
Anything new?

210
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,648
Things regarding our friend

211
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,565

212
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,984

Listen, when are you gonnaget a?

Well, do it! Make upsome proba!

216
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,272
A warrant requiresPrice signin.

217
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,871
Byrd, we need this!

218
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,059
Look, you don't think I know t?

219
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,541
Then get creative, man.

220
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,585
Do whatever it takes.

221
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,048
If he can't getthat phone pinn.

222
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,331
Anything from Coleon Tom's con?

223
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:21,761
He's still stable, right?

224
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,891
Well, I don't know.

225
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,255
Steve, we reallyshould go see.

226
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,021
I'm not stopping you, Karen.

227
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:34,150
We can't let what happenedto h.

228
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,819
The rest of the Ravensare gonna.

229
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,195
We'll handle it.-Look, he is s,

230
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,030
but what happenswhen he goes ba?

231
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,874
What's withthe drama, ?

232
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,020
They came in too fast. I could-

233
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,364
- You motherfucker!-Don't touch!

234
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,004
The hell is this about?!

235
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,134
You know what this is about.

236
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:03,388
What happened to Tom was boundt.

237
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,390
So I figured why notconfront it?

238
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,558
Clear the air?

239
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,977
That's what this is?

240
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,563
You think we'd retaliatebecause?

241
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,356
Tom and I share a last name.

242
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,482
Not much else.

243
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,776
I'm not buying it.

244
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,987
You care aboutall these idiots.

245
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,321
Brother, you kill us I,

246
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,781
in a cop bar...

247
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,743
He's right. Every cop in the wo.

248
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,035
You think I care about that?

249
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,999
What really happenedto my broth?

250
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,322
Did one of you idiotsdo somethi?

251
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,242
I already told you, he never.

252
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,373
Is my brother dead, Hammond?

253
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,220
No, and I can prove it.

254
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,638
How?

255
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,474
He texted me last night.

256
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,893
That's bulllshit.

257
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,256
See for yourself. Phone's right.

258
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,824
My brother didn'ttype that mes.

259
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:05,533
You sent that to yourself, di?

260
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,368
Why would I do that?

261
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,912
Alibi maybe?

262
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,164
Sleep disappearedbefore Tom wa.

263
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,042
So what motivationwould any of?

264
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,003
I don't know.

265
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,713
But I'm about to find out.

266
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,803
What the hell is this? Hey!

267
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:25,846
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

268
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,017
What are you doing?

269
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,136
I'm getting answers the smar.

270
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,578
Get in here.

271
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,499
What's going on?

272
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,877
Have the Ravenshad any contactp

273
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,201
since you've beenassigned to th?

274
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,203
No, like I told you, he never.

275
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,173
But according to your re,

276
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,217
you met with his brother.

277
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,261
A man they call Neckbone. Yeah.

278
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,637
Why?-What did he want?

279
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,138
He was looking for his brother.

280
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,850
It's all there in front of you..

281
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,213
So Hammond nevertalked to Slee?

282
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,105
Not that I'm aware of.

283
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,523
Because Sleep sent hima text l.

284
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,525
You have Sleep's phone records.

285
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:21,985
Yes, of course we do.

286
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:24,445
You sure you're not being pl?

287
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,989
I don't think so.

288
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,534
He doesn't think so.

289
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:30,578
I'll lean on Hammond.

290
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:32,620
Find out whatthe text was about.

291
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,289
Damon, if Hammond is lying

292
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:34,914
about being incontact with Slee,

293
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,000
I want to know why.

294
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,753
I'm real close torearre.

295
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,839
You have yourself a short runway

296
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,549
to get thingsback under control.

297
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,092
Do you understand me?

298
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,218
I understand, sir.

299
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,012
Is there anything else we ne?

300
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,089
Nothing significant to report.

301
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,565
Okay, get some sleep.

302
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,410
Tell me your name.

303
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:15,079
Steve Hammond.

304
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,123
Did you kill?

305
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:20,752
No.-

306
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,003
Did a Raven kill Sleep?

307
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,466
No.

308
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,971
Well, get to it, man. Ask him i.

309
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,015
Was Sleep, to yourknowledge, m?

310
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,190
No.

311
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:45,860
He's telling.

312
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,696
You sure this thing's working?

313
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,009
I mean, he's a copwhich means h.

314
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:53,785
In a situation withthis ki,

315
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,912
there's no wayhe could fool it.

316
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,164
I already told you. We know not.

317
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:02,126
So, now what? You gonna apologi?

318
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,047
No.-You ever think maybe Sleep?

319
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,632
Well, if he isn't dead, then?

320
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,092
Witness Protection.-And how yo?

321
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,637
If they picked him up beforehe,

322
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:13,721
they probably flipped him.

323
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,724
And that's probablywhy he's texe

324
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,017
he was supposed to meet with.

325
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,978
Trying to set us up to get out.

326
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,815
My brother's a lot of things...

327
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,138
but an informantisn't one of 'e.

328
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,777
Everything's back in place.

329
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,947
When you get somemore informatin

330
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,574
on that WMD drugor who's moving,

331
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,034
I want to hear about it.

332
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,995
What about Tom?-What about him?

333
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,584
Your rent's going up.

334
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,172
You okay, Steve?

335
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,216
No.

336
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:00,964
How the hell didhe beat a poly?

337
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,772
State of mind.

338
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,096
Technically, we didn't kill him.

339
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,401
The fall did.

340
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,079
I see Cole.

341
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,999
I see Ramos. I see Bitch.

342
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,003
Did you kill Sleep, Steve?

343
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,008
Did a Raven kill Sleep?

344
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,979
Was Sleep, to yourknowledge, mu?

345
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,469
Steve, we.

346
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,428
I'm a little worried.

347
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,056
Got more and more eyes in here.

I'm having a good day, Steve.

00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,606
Besides...

355
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,983
my garden's gone to shit.

356
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,611
What's bothering you?

357
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,072

Have you visitedyour father yet?

364
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,986
No.

365
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,990
Can you do it?

366
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,996
For me?

367
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,300
Yeah.-

00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,867
I missed you so much.

372
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,370
You know how much I missed you?

373
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,120
Where have you been?

374
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:48,996
I've been at work, baby.

375
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,875
Yeah, what are you doing here?

376
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,239
I came to takemy princesa to s.

377
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,283
Veronica, can yougo upstairs, ?

378
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,298
Go on, listen to your mama.

379
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,259
Love you.

380
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,426
Love you, too!

381
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,595
You look nice.

382
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,346
You know, I don't thinkit's a a

383
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,932
you showing up like this.

384
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,726
It's my house.-Yeah, it's our.

385
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,937
And until we figure this out,

386
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,605
I don't want to confuse her. A.

387
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,399
But I mean... I miss her.

388
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,027
She misses you.

389
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,196
But... I don't want you drivin.

390
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,032
Why?

391
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,201
Because I was rethinkingthing,

392
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,828
and I was gonna call youand I w,

393
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,015
and maybe even ask you to come.

394
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,666
And then, I foundsome cash in y.

395
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,626
It's money from a side job!

396
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,211
Side job? It was $5,000!

397
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:40,131
Okay, yes, but please just he?

398
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,402
I don't want to havethis conver!

399
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,216
I'm working with the Fedsto hen

400
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,885
the gangs in the department!

401
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,073
You're lying!-I'm not lying! I!

402
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,377
I put that on ourdaughter's lif!

403
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,974
Don't you dare do that!

404
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,434
Don't you dare swearon Veronica.

405
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,060
Don't you dare.

406
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,384
It's what people dowhen they're.

407
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,627
I just want my family back.

408
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,984
Well, I want the manl thought.

409
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,781
So it looks like right now...

410
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,025
neither of usget what we want.

411
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,001
My God.

412
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,553
What good is this doing?

413
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:30,097
More than you think.

414
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,224
We all internalize pain from ou.

415
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,185
It needs to be processed.

416
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:38,439
Otherwise, we're at the mercyof,

417
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,399
and can't control.

418
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:41,734
You know that complaint?

419
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,819
The one that landed me in here,

420
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,143
the one that'sunder investigati?

421
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,064
You know whatthat dirt bag did?

422
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,993
Raped his own child.

423
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,372
She was six.

424
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,667
It's understandable thatcould.

425
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,753
But you're deflecting again.

426
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,421
We're looking earlier than that.

427
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,465
For the source.

428
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,009
So, you want my childhood?

429
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,095
Okay.

430
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,597
My father...

431
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,057
We'll just call him that

432
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,643
being how he's the one whoshot.

433
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:16,977
He left before I was born.

434
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,817
And my mother is oneof those mon

435
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,609
who can't seemto get through a y

436
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,236
without a man by her side.

437
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,987
Any man.

438
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,573
How many?

439
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,992
I don't know. I didn't count.

440
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,248
A lot.

441
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,333
Any abusers?

442
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,001
Pedophiles?

443
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,800
Is your mother still alive?

444
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,975
Last I checked.

445
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,338
You don't have much contact wi?

446
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,356
Would you?

447
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,298
You think they know we h?

448
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,425
'Cause they didn't pulla big nu.

449
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,051
I don't know.

450
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,762
But we can't go intothe pension.

451
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,097
It'll raise too many red flags.

452
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,016
Is he gonna throw in?

453
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,687
I sank most of my money into p.

454
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:42,980
Let's just grab what's left.

455
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,857
We'll pool our money. Figure it.

456
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:45,441
We're really gonnapay this ass?

457
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,942
We got no choice.

458
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,029
Unless Byrd finds that phone.

459
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,282
I'm trying.-If you could've do.

460
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:57,203

And when there'sfamilies involv,

501
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,008
they suffer the most.

502
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,013

Put their safety first,

511
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,997
and stay away from them.

512
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,018

Why'd you become a cop?

557
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,503
Third generation.

558
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,254
So family loyalty?

559
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,006
I guess. Why?

560
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,802
That's whatthe Ravens are to m.

we're gonna get it back.

577
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,318
Earbuds are in the bag. They.

00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:37,996
What about Byrd? He gonna be th?

579
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,082
No.

580
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,750
Why not?

581
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,418
Because once we have the phone,

582
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,169
decisions are gonna have to be e

583
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,338

584
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,298
Decisions?

585
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,842
We can't afford to havethis gud

00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:00,353
Let's go!

588
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,478
I was worried about him.

589
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,563
You shouldn't be.

590
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,523
Tom cares abouthimself, not you,

591
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,608

592
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:30,984
You're wrong about that.

We're about to kill a man.

00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,419
