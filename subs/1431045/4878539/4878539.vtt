1
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.579
Kinda lonesome back here.

2
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.649
Yeah, little help.

3
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.650
Ok.

4
00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.303
Just, I have to keep
my hands on the wheel.

5
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.320
Excuse me.

6
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.830
Dopinder.

7
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.519
Pool.

8
00:03:18.644 --> 00:03:19.554
Dead.

9
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.660
Nice.

10
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.830
Smells good, no?

11
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.166
Not the daffodil daydream.

12
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:26.869
The girl.

13
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.770
Yes. Gita.

14
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.609
She is quite lovely.

15
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.839
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife.

16
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.140
But...

17
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.979
Gita's heart has been stolen
by my cousin Bandhu.

18
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.520
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

19
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.889
Dopinder, I'm starting to think

20
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.819
there's a reason I'm in this cab today.

21
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.359
Yeah sir, you called for it remember?

22
00:03:49.383 --> 00:03:51.747
No, my slender brown friend.
Love..

23
00:03:52.372 --> 00:03:54.183
Is a beautiful thing.

24
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.530
When you find it, the whole world
tastes like daffodil daydream.

25
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.469
So you gotta hold onto love...

26
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.769
tight!

27
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.409
And never let go.

28
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.560
Don't make the same mistakes I did.
Got it?

29
00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:06.364
Yeah.

30
00:04:06.452 --> 00:04:10.009
Or else the whole world tastes
like mama June after hot yoga.

31
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.649
Sir, what does miss mama June taste like?

32
00:04:12.673 --> 00:04:14.113
Like two hobos,

33
00:04:14.114 --> 00:04:15.849
fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
Ok, enough.

34
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.189
I can go all day, Dopinder.
The point is, it's bad!

35
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.690
It's bad.

36
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.029
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?

37
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.329
Oh, that's because
it's Christmas day, Dopinder.

38
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.960
And I'm after someone on my naughty list.

39
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.960
I've been waiting one year,
three weeks,

40
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.330
Six days and...

41
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.370
14 minutes to make him
fix what he did to me.

42
00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:37.709
And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?

43
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.440
This shit...

44
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.870
They won't disappoint.

45
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.699
They'd better not.

46
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.169
And what about next month's shipment?

47
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.109
There won't be one.

48
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.250
You're not the only one
with a war to win.

49
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.680
That won't do.

50
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.750
See, we've had this small disruption
to our supply chain...

51
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.990
We'd appreciate your patience.

52
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.160
Ok.

53
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.730
We'll deliver in full
the following month.

54
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.910
Pleasure doing business with you.

55
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.010
Fucking mutant.

56
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.819
Oh, shit!

57
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.519
I forgot my ammo bag.

58
00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.989
Shall we turn back?

59
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.159
No, no time.

60
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.859
Fuck it. I got this.

61
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.201
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets,

62
00:06:04.426 --> 00:06:05.359
or bust.

63
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.390
Right here!

64
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.969
That's... $27.50.

65
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.869
I never carry a wallet when I'm working.

66
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.639
Ruins the lines of my suit.

67
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.209
But, how about a crisp high five?

68
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.439
Ok.

69
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.809
Merry Christmas.

70
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.149
And a convivial Tuesday
in April to you too, Pool!

71
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.412
Oh, hello.

72
00:06:46.726 --> 00:06:48.369
I know, right?

73
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.270
Whose balls did I have to fondle
to get my very own movie?

74
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.679
I can't tell you,

75
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.140
but it does rhyme with polverine.

76
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.599
And let me tell you,

77
00:06:57.812 --> 00:07:01.349
he's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under.

78
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.319
Anyway, I got places to be,
a face to fix and...

79
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.020
Bad guys to kill.

80
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.260
Maximum effort.

81
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.370
Cock shot.

82
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.250
Rich corinthian leather.

83
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.959
I'm looking for Francis!

84
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.860
Have you seen this man?

85
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.270
Yanky, yanky!

86
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.970
I've never said this,
but don't swallow.

87
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.689
Shit.

88
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.060
Did I leave the stove on?

89
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.679
<i>Now, breaking news.</i>

90
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.849
<i>A multi-car collision turned shots fired</i>

91
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.749
<i>on the crosstown expressway
this morning.</i>

92
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.789
<i>Gridlock has kept police
from the scene.</i>

93
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.459
<i>Residents are advised
to remain in their homes.</i>

94
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.220
<i>The assailant appears to be armed,</i>

95
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.829
<i>dangerous and wearing,</i>

96
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.060
<i>A red suit.</i>
A red suit.

97
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.959
Deadpool.

98
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.558
Negasonic! Come!

99
00:09:29.783 --> 00:09:30.854
We have mission.

100
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.069
Colossus, wait up.

101
00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.309
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us,

102
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.470
but he'd rather act like a child.

103
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.140
A heavily-armed child.

104
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.249
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming x-man?

105
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.279
Which benefits?
The matching unitards?

106
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.280
The house that blows up
every few years?

107
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.389
Please.

108
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.489
House blowing up builds character.

109
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.920
You ate breakfast, yes?

110
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.859
Breakfast is most
important meal of day.

111
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.320
Here, protein bar.

112
00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.029
Good for bones.

113
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.100
Deadpool may try to break yours.

114
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.710
Get out of the way!

115
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.110
Wait!

116
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.709
You may be wondering,
why the red suit?

117
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.950
Well, that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.

118
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.419
This guy's got the right idea.

119
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.850
He wore the brown pants.

120
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.919
Fine! I only have 12 bullets.

121
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.589
So you're gonna have to share!

122
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:02.990
Let's count them down.

123
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.880
Shit.

124
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.680
Motherfucker!

125
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.190
10! Shit!

126
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.720
Nine. Fuck.

127
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.190
Eight.

128
00:11:34.214 --> 00:11:35.190
Shit-fuck!

129
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.060
Bad Deadpool.

130
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.181
Seven.

131
00:11:42.706 --> 00:11:43.694
Good Deadpool.

132
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.230
Someone's not counting.

133
00:12:07.854 --> 00:12:08.654
Six.

134
00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:27.778
Cinquo.

135
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.450
Four.

136
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.750
Gotcha.

137
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.090
Right up main street.

138
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.029
Three, two

139
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.800
Stupid! Worth it.

140
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.130
I'm touching myself tonight.

141
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.429
Francis!

142
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.800
Francis...

143
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.030
What the shit-biscuit!

144
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.770
Where you at, Francis?

145
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.080
You're not Francis.

146
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.510
Really?

147
00:13:47.024 --> 00:13:48.473
Rolling up the sleeves?

148
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.069
<font color="#00ffff"><i>You're probably thinking,</i></font>

149
00:14:00.093 --> 00:14:02.200
<font color="#00ffff"><i>my boyfriend said
this was a superhero movie,</i></font>

150
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.669
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but that guy in the red suit just turned</i></font>

151
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.709
<font color="#00ffff"><i>that other guy into a fucking kabab!</i></font>

152
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.579
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Well, I may be super, but I'm no hero.</i></font>

153
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.749
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And yeah, technically this is a murder.</i></font>

154
00:14:12.973 --> 00:14:15.219
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But some of the best love
stories start with a murder.</i></font>

155
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.389
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And that's exactly what this is,
a love story.</i></font>

156
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:19.850
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And to tell it right,</i></font>

157
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.059
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I gotta take you back to long before.</i></font>

158
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.590
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I squeezed this ass into red spandex.</i></font>

159
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.029
Look, would it help if I slow it
down for you?

160
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.799
I didn't order the pizza.

161
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.739
Is this 7348 red ledge drive?
Are you Mr. merchant?

162
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.239
Yeah, the Mr. merchant
who didn't order the fucking pie!

163
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.410
Then who placed the call?

164
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.880
I did!

165
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.779
Pineapple and olive?

166
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.249
Sweet and salty.

167
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.619
The fuck are you?

168
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.219
The fuck you doing in my crib...

169
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.620
Is it burnt crust?

170
00:14:52.644 --> 00:14:54.119
I... god, I hope not.

171
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.105
Man look,

172
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.659
if this is about that poker game.

173
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.729
I told Howie, I told, I told him that...

174
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.635
Look, just...

175
00:15:01.049 --> 00:15:02.729
take whatever you want.

176
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:03.969
Thanks.

177
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.269
Sir, before you do anything to him,

178
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.200
do you mind if I get a big tip?

179
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.939
Jeremy, is it?

180
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.270
Wade. Wade Wilson.

181
00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.979
That is a no go on the tiperoo, Jer.

182
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.049
I'm not here for him.

183
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.780
I'm here for you.

184
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.580
Ok, well dodged
a big-time bullet on that one.

185
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.889
Is not out of the woods yet.

186
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.519
You need to seriously ease up
on the bedazzling.

187
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.620
They're jeans, not a chandelier.

188
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.759
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kinda give it to me.

189
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.759
Ok, just look, man,
can I have my Sam's card...

190
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.029
I will shoot your fucking cat!

191
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.430
I don't really know what that means.
I don't have a cat.

192
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.400
Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?

193
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.409
Anyhoo, tell me something...

194
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.164
What situation...

195
00:15:50.989 --> 00:15:52.549
isn't improved by pizza?

196
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.849
Do you happen to know
a Meghan Orflosky?

197
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.280
Getting that right? Orflosky?

198
00:15:56.304 --> 00:15:57.490
Orlovsky?
Yeah?

199
00:15:57.803 --> 00:15:58.803
Good.

200
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.289
Because she knows you.

201
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:02.248
Jeremy,

202
00:16:02.373 --> 00:16:04.010
I belong to a group of guys who

203
00:16:04.235 --> 00:16:05.559
take a dime to beat a fella down.

204
00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.429
And little Meghan,
she's not made of money,

205
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:08.629
but lucky for her...

206
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.260
I got a soft spot.

207
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.469
But I'm a...
A stalker.

208
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.539
Threats hurt, Jer.

209
00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.909
Though not nearly as badly,
as serrated steel.

210
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.409
So keep away from Meghan.

211
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.510
Cool?

212
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.740
Yes. Yes, sir.

213
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.849
Then we're done.

214
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.349
Wait. We are?

215
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:28.419
Yeah. We're totally done.

216
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.049
You should've seen your face.

217
00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:32.689
I didn't know what to do.
I was so scared.

218
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:33.820
Soft spot, remember?

219
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.459
You even look in her
general direction again.

220
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.959
And you will learn in the worst of ways

221
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.900
that I have some hard spots too.

222
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.500
That came out wrong.

223
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.770
Or did it?

224
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.720
Meghan?

225
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.010
You've heard the last of Jeremy.
He's sorry.

226
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.160
No frigging way.

227
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.329
Should've brought my roller blades.

228
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.760
Show these kids how it's done.

229
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:19.069
Oh. And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

230
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:21.039
Hey, think you could fuck up my step-dad?

231
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.960
I give a guy a pavement facial,
it's because he's earned it.

232
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:25.770
Hey, wait!

233
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.909
You're my hero.

234
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.180
No, no, no, no. That I ain't!

235
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.280
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Nope. Never will be.</i></font>

236
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.589
Fuck you, Wade.

237
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.160
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.</i></font>

238
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.259
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Welcome to sister Margaret's.</i></font>

239
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.829
<font color="#00ffff"><i>It's like a job fair for mercenaries.</i></font>

240
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.469
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Think of us as really
fucked up tooth fairies.</i></font>

241
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.029
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Except we knock out the teeth
and take the cash.</i></font>

242
00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.099
<font color="#00ffff"><i>You'd best hope we never see
your name on a gold card.</i></font>

243
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.969
Buck! Liefeld.

244
00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.379
Hey, Wade!
Wade Wilson, patron Saint of the pitiful.

245
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.339
What can I do for you?

246
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.279
I'd love a blow job.

247
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.679
Oh, god, me too.

248
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.810
The drink, moose knuckle.
But first...

249
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.519
Hey, and I ain't taking
any babysitting money, all right?

250
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.089
Make sure that gets back to Ms...

251
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.659
Orlovsky.
Yeah, her.

252
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.090
You sure?

253
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.259
You know for a merc,
you're pretty warm-blooded.

254
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.029
I bet you let the kid off easy, too.

255
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.799
He's not a bad kid, Weas.

256
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.629
Just a little light stalking.

257
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.269
I was way worse than him
when I was his age.

258
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.899
I was traveling to exotic places...

259
00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.669
Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville,

260
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.669
meeting new and exciting people.
And then...

261
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.670
Killing them.
Yeah, I've seen your instagram.

262
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.409
So what was special forces doing
in Jacksonville, anyway?

263
00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:37.609
That's classified.

264
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.049
They have a wonderful TGI Fridays.

265
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.449
All right, Kahlua, Baileys and...

266
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:43.919
Whipped cream.

267
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.650
I give you a blow job.

268
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.919
Why do you make me make that?

269
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.389
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.

270
00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.129
Take that over to buck please
and tell him it's from boothe.

271
00:18:52.153 --> 00:18:53.159
Little foreplay.

272
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.529
Remind me what good
will come of this?

273
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.499
I don't take the shits.
I just disturb them.

274
00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.799
Boothe!

275
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.399
Easy, man.
Hold up! Hold up!

276
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.470
What you want?

277
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.094
Cheers. To your health.
Fuck you.

278
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.839
Come here, you fat fuck!

279
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.240
That's a new stool.

280
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.850
Stay the fuck down.

281
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.419
Took his ass out!

282
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.989
All right, move.
Move, move, move.

283
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.260
Buck, go rest.

284
00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.050
Boothe got hit then went down.

285
00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.170
Yeah, he's still breathing.

286
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.339
Nobody wins today.

287
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.039
Nice try, Wade.

288
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.579
You got me.
I picked boothe in the dead pool.

289
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.740
Who did you pick?

290
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.249
Yeah, Wade, about that...

291
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.279
No.

292
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.120
You did not bet on me to die.

293
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.289
You bet on me to die.

294
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.459
Motherfucker,
you're the world's worst friend.

295
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.589
Well, joke's on you.
I'm living to 102.

296
00:19:57.613 --> 00:19:59.729
And then dying.
Like the city of Detroit.

297
00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.193
I'm sorry. I just...

298
00:20:01.218 --> 00:20:02.829
I wanted to win money.

299
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.129
I never win anything.

300
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.130
Whatever.

301
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.370
Soldiers of fortune, drinks on me!

302
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.240
Domestic, nothing imported.

303
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.510
Baby, are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

304
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.420
Tight.

305
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:25.619
Vanessa.
Wade.

306
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.720
What's a nice place like you
doing in a girl like this?

307
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.230
I'd hit that.

308
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.499
Buck, you best apologize before...

309
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.699
Yeah, that.

310
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.669
Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.

311
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.499
I'm sorry.
Breathe through the nose.

312
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.769
I don't have a filter
between my brain and my...

313
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:43.970
Ok.

314
00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.479
Hakuna his tatas. He's sorry.

315
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.240
Get out of here.
Go. Go cast a spell.

316
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.550
Hey. Hands off the merchandise.

317
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.820
Merchandise?

318
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.349
So you...

319
00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:59.219
Bump fuzzies for money?

320
00:20:59.220 --> 00:20:59.862
Yep.

321
00:20:59.987 --> 00:21:01.113
Rough childhood?

322
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.559
Rougher than yours.

323
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.029
Daddy left before I was born.

324
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.230
Daddy left before I was conceived.

325
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.099
Ever had a cigarette put out
on your skin?

326
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.599
Where else do you put one out?

327
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.869
I was molested.

328
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.669
Me too. Uncle.

329
00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.639
Uncles. They took turns.

330
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.669
I watched my own birthday party

331
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:18.869
through the keyhole of a locked closet...

332
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:20.270
Which also happens to be my...

333
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.424
Your bedroom. Lucky.

334
00:21:21.449 --> 00:21:23.140
I slept in a dishwasher box.

335
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.449
You had a dishwasher.

336
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.849
I didn't even know sleep.

337
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.779
It was pretty much 24/7 ball gags,

338
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.250
brownie mix and clown porn.

339
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.420
Who would do such a thing?

340
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.262
Hopefully you...

341
00:21:39.087 --> 00:21:40.354
later tonight?

342
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.130
Hey what...

343
00:21:43.408 --> 00:21:44.511
can I get for...

344
00:21:45.436 --> 00:21:47.789
$275 and a...

345
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.039
A yogurtland rewards card?

346
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.810
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.

347
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.880
And a low-fat dessert.

348
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.620
Did she just put
a gift card in your mouth?

349
00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:09.620
It's time to put balls in holes.

350
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.490
You said whatever I want.

351
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.199
I get it.

352
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.799
You love skee ball.

353
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.369
Apparently more than you love vagina.

354
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.730
That's a tough call.

355
00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.100
I just wanna get to know
the real you, you know.

356
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.109
Not the short-shorted,
two-dimensional

357
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.970
sex object peddled by Hollywood.

358
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.379
Balls in holes.

359
00:22:29.292 --> 00:22:30.379
Balls in holes.

360
00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.909
Prepare to lose tragically.

361
00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:33.534
Bring it, big man.
Ok.

362
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.619
The limited edition.

363
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.712
Voltron, defender of the universe ring,

364
00:22:44.037 --> 00:22:44.989
por favor.

365
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.359
Ok. Here we go.

366
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.599
Had my eye on this sucker for a while.

367
00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.830
And I will take the pencil eraser.

368
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.639
Ok. You are now the protector
of the planet arus.

369
00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.139
And you can erase stuff.

370
00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.309
Written in pencil.

371
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:01.979
My lady.

372
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.010
Well, I hate to break it to you
but your 48 minutes are up.

373
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.519
Hey, how many more minutes
can I get for this?

374
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.089
FYI, 5 mini lion-bots come together
to form one super-bot so...

375
00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.012
Five mini lion-bots?

376
00:23:15.537 --> 00:23:16.789
Three minutes.

377
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:17.711
Deal.

378
00:23:17.736 --> 00:23:19.999
What do we do with the remaining
two minutes, 37 seconds?

379
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:22.030
Cuddle?

380
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.899
How long can you keep this up?

381
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.240
All year?

382
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.450
Happy Valentine's day.

383
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.859
Happy Chinese new year.

384
00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.290
Year of the dog.

385
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.569
Relax.

386
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.440
And happy international women's day.

387
00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:08.540
No. No. No. No.

388
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.450
Happy lent.

389
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.049
Wade?
Sorry.

390
00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:20.250
Happy Halloween.

391
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.890
Happy Halloween.

392
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.800
Happy Thanksgiving.

393
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.240
I love you.

394
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.209
If your left leg is Thanksgiving,

395
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.110
and your right leg is Christmas...

396
00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.680
Can I visit you between the holidays?

397
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.780
That sweater is terrible.

398
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.319
But red looks good on you.

399
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.759
Red's your color.

400
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.190
Brings out the bloodshot in your eyes.

401
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.289
Listen, I've been thinking...

402
00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.629
Really?

403
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:01.899
About why we're so good together.

404
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.429
Why's that?

405
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.938
Well, your crazy
matches my crazy.

406
00:25:07.063 --> 00:25:08.065
Big time.

407
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:09.805
And...

408
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.509
we're like two Jigsaw pieces you know...

409
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.409
the weird curvy edges.

410
00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.880
You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.

411
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.510
Right.

412
00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.249
Wade.

413
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:21.779
There's something I've been
meaning to ask you.

414
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.150
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

415
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.260
Will you...

416
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.920
Stick it in my...
Marry me?

417
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.530
Jinx?

418
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.469
Where were you hiding that?

419
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:39.499
Nowhere.

420
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.099
They say one month's salary. So...

421
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.339
You mean?

422
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.400
I do.

423
00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.470
That's my line.

424
00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.409
I love you, Wade Wilson.

425
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.810
You're supposed to... So that's a...

426
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.820
Yes!

427
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.980
Yes!

428
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.650
I feel just like a little girl.

429
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.329
What if I just held on and never let go?

430
00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.860
Just ride a bitch's back,
like Yoda on Luke.

431
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.300
Star wars jokes.

432
00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:13.970
Empire.

433
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:16.939
Jesus Christ.

434
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.540
It's like I made you in a computer.

435
00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:23.840
Hey.

436
00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.150
Perfect.

437
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:31.649
Let's see. All right, wee break.

438
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.020
Shake it, yeah.

439
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.490
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Here's the thing.</i></font>

440
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.960
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Life is an endless series of train-wrecks,</i></font>

441
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.469
<font color="#00ffff"><i>with only brief,
commercial-like breaks of happiness.</i></font>

442
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.970
<font color="#00ffff"><i>This had been the ultimate
commercial break.</i></font>

443
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:53.809
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Which meant it was time to return,</i></font>

444
00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:55.909
<font color="#00ffff"><i>to our regularly scheduled program.</i></font>

445
00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:57.040
What the...

446
00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:58.980
Oh, my god. Wade?

447
00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:06.289
You're clowning.

448
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.189
You're not clowning?

449
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:09.839
I sense clowns.

450
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.090
People react to news of
late-stage cancer differently.

451
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.099
There are certainly options
we can look into.

452
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.870
New drugs are being developed every day.

453
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:23.939
So what do we do?

454
00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.539
Surely there is something we can do.

455
00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.479
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed
with thyroid cancer,

456
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.079
and there were all these new
experimental drugs from Germany.

457
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.479
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Vanessa's already working on plan A, b,</i></font>

458
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.980
<font color="#00ffff"><i>all the way through Z.</i></font>

459
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:41.059
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Me? I'm memorizing
the details of her face.</i></font>

460
00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.920
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.</i></font>

461
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:45.459
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Or the last.</i></font>

462
00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.529
Mr. Wilson...

463
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:48.159
Mr. Wilson?

464
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.829
Take your time to process this.

465
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.230
<i>It's important not to do anything rash.</i>

466
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.379
Now, if I were a 200-pound sack

467
00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.050
of assholes named Francis,
where would I hide?

468
00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.149
A hush falls over the crowd

469
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:40.649
as rookie sensation Wade W. Wilson.

470
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.280
Out of Regina, saskatchewan,
lines up the shot.

471
00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.290
His form looks good.

472
00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:54.129
And that's why Regina rhymes with fun.

473
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.429
Ladies and gentlemen,
what you're witnessing.

474
00:28:56.453 --> 00:28:59.000
Is sweet dick-kicking revenge.

475
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.269
Giving him the business.

476
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:02.800
Incoming!

477
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:07.670
This is taking unsportsmanlike
conduct to a whole new level!

478
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.019
Looking good, Francis. Well rested.

479
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.680
Like you've been pitching, not catching.

480
00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.220
Ringing any bells? No?

481
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.490
How about now?

482
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.630
Wade fucking Wilson.

483
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.519
Well, hello, gorgeous.

484
00:29:35.543 --> 00:29:38.069
Yeah, like I got bit
by a radioactive shar-pei.

485
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.770
Yeah. And whose fault is that, Francis?

486
00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.509
Yeah, time to undo what
you did to this butterface.

487
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.049
Please, you should thank me.

488
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.179
Apparently, I made you immortal.

489
00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.719
I'm actually quite jealous.

490
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.820
Yeah, but this ain't a life
worth living, is it?

491
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.097
Now...

492
00:29:53.511 --> 00:29:54.732
I'm about to do to you,

493
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.460
what limp bizkit did
to music in the late 90s.

494
00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.490
Dad?

495
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:06.599
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I think we can all agree
that shit just went sideways</i></font>

496
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.240
<font color="#00ffff"><i>in the most colossal way.</i></font>

497
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.169
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Well, maybe not the most.</i></font>

498
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.380
This is my most prized possession.

499
00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.340
Wham?

500
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.309
No, no, no. Wham!

501
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.920
Make it big is the album that George
and Andy earned the exclamation point.

502
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.749
So, am I supposed to just smile

503
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.219
and wave you out the door?

504
00:30:27.232 --> 00:30:28.719
Think of it like spring cleaning.

505
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.059
Only if spring was death.

506
00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.629
God, if I had a nickel for every time

507
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.529
I spanked it to Bernadette Peters.

508
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:36.460
Sounds like you do.

509
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.399
Bernadette is not going anywhere,

510
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.099
because you're not going anywhere.

511
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.500
Drink.

512
00:30:42.524 --> 00:30:45.409
You're right. Cancer is only in my liver,
lungs, prostate and brain.

513
00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.640
All things I can live without.

514
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.579
You belong here at home.

515
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.558
Surrounded by your Voltron
and your Bernadette,

516
00:30:53.583 --> 00:30:54.574
and your me.

517
00:30:55.063 --> 00:30:56.063
Listen,

518
00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.614
we both know that cancer,
is a shit-show.

519
00:30:59.903 --> 00:31:03.289
Like, a Yakov Smirnoff opening for the

520
00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:06.960
spin doctors
at the Iowa state fair shit show.

521
00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.553
And under no circumstances,

522
00:31:09.678 --> 00:31:12.624
will I take you to that show.

523
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.500
I want you to remember me.

524
00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.839
Not the ghost of Christmas me.

525
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.970
Well, I wanna remember us.

526
00:31:20.983 --> 00:31:23.009
I swear to god, I will find
you in the next life

527
00:31:23.033 --> 00:31:25.649
and I'm gonna boom-box
careless whisper outside your window.

528
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:27.250
Wham!

529
00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.390
No one is boom-boxing shit. Ok?

530
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:37.990
We can fight this.

531
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.360
Besides, I just realized something.

532
00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.152
You win.

533
00:31:45.377 --> 00:31:48.600
Your life is officially
way more fucked up than mine.

534
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.740
I love you.

535
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.420
Wade.

536
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:10.759
Weas.

537
00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.359
You look like you need
a blow job and a shower.

538
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.699
Though courtesy calls
for the latter first.

539
00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.460
How about three shots of patron?

540
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:21.299
Or how about triticum aestivum,
wheatgrass.

541
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.639
Excellent for the immune system.

542
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.739
Jesus Christ.
You sound like Vanessa.

543
00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.019
Here, check it out.

544
00:32:26.043 --> 00:32:28.809
She's sending away for all these
colorful clinic brochures.

545
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:31.409
I'm sure they're all FDA approved.

546
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.435
Chechnya?

547
00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.634
Isn't that where you go to get cancer?

548
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.549
You got China and central Mexico.

549
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:40.219
You know how they say cancer in Spanish?

550
00:32:40.243 --> 00:32:41.150
No.

551
00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:42.889
<i>El cancer.</i>

552
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.059
I could have guessed that.

553
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.229
Look how happy you look here.

554
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:48.999
Mind if I keep this? Put it up,

555
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.097
so I can remember,

556
00:32:50.122 --> 00:32:51.523
when you looked alive.

557
00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.599
At least now I'm gonna win the dead pool.

558
00:32:53.623 --> 00:32:56.700
Now that you're gonna die
tragically of cancer.

559
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.410
I got it, Weas. Thanks.

560
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:03.709
And, that guy over there
came in looking for you.

561
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.449
Real grim reaper type.

562
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.680
I don't know. Might further the plot.

563
00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:13.690
Boothe.

564
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:14.790
Wade.

565
00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.390
Mr. Wilson.

566
00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.899
How can I help you?

567
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.569
Besides luring children into a panel Van.

568
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:29.439
I understand you've recently
been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

569
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.540
Stalker alert.

570
00:33:30.564 --> 00:33:32.509
It's my job. Recruitment.

571
00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:36.540
I'm sorry you've had such a tough go.

572
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.409
But you're a fighter. Special forces.

573
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.119
41 confirmed kills.

574
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.680
One every seven weeks.

575
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.219
Same rate most folks get a haircut.

576
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.989
It's to wash the taste out.

577
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:49.586
It's tough to forget being so...

578
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.559
impressive.

579
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.590
And now you spend your days,

580
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.499
sticking up for the little people...

581
00:33:55.523 --> 00:33:57.099
Yeah, people change.
What do you want?

582
00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.730
I represent an organization
that may be able to help.

583
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.339
What if I told you
we can cure your cancer?

584
00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.010
And what's more, give you abilities
most men only dream of?

585
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.579
I'd say that you sound
like an infomercial,

586
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.749
but not a good one, like slap chop.

587
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:20.489
More shake weight-y.

588
00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:23.359
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.

589
00:34:23.383 --> 00:34:25.389
We won't just make you better.

590
00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.560
We will make you better than better.

591
00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.960
A superhero.

592
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:32.028
Look,

593
00:34:32.953 --> 00:34:34.123
agent Smith,

594
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.439
I tried the hero business
and it left a mark.

595
00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.710
But if I ever hit fuck it,
I'll look you up.

596
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.579
Shit. We're within 500 yards of a school,

597
00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:44.810
so you may wanna, you know.

598
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:50.820
His drink's on him.

599
00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:57.820
What did he say?

600
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.519
Hey, what's going on?

601
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.820
Hey. Sorry.

602
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.219
I had a Liam Neeson nightmare.

603
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.030
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.

604
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:41.205
Hey...

605
00:35:42.219 --> 00:35:44.409
they've made three of those movies.

606
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.210
At some point you have
to wonder if he's just a bad parent.

You know, I can hear you.

619
00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.095
I wasn't talking to you.

620
00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.679
I was talking to them.

621
00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.479
Stay right here.

622
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.049
You've been warned before, Deadpool.

623
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:04.980
This is a shameful and
reckless use of your powers.

624
00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.119
You will both be coming with us.

625
00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.430
Look Colossus,

626
00:37:08.531 --> 00:37:11.159
I don't have time for the goody
two shoes bullshit right now!

627
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.090
And you are?

628
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.429
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

629
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:19.729
Negasonic teenage...
What the shit?

630
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.930
That's the coolest name ever!

631
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.600
So what, you're like...

632
00:37:25.025 --> 00:37:26.009
his sidekick?

633
00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.439
No. Trainee.

634
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.739
Let me guess.

635
00:37:28.752 --> 00:37:30.480
X-Men left you behind on what?

636
00:37:30.605 --> 00:37:31.604
Shit detail?

637
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.929
What does that make you?

638
00:37:32.953 --> 00:37:35.179
Pretending you're not here,
negasonic teenage warhead.

639
00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.549
Can we trade names?

640
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:38.149
Can we go?

641
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.489
Look! I'm a teenage girl.

642
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.789
I'd rather be anywhere than here.

643
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:45.089
I'm all about long sullen silences.

644
00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:48.729
Followed by mean comments,
followed by more silences.

645
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.279
So what's it gonna be?

646
00:37:50.604 --> 00:37:52.269
Long sullen silence.

647
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.470
Or mean comment?
Go on.

648
00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.540
You got me in a box here.

649
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.639
We can't allow this, Deadpool.

650
00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.039
Please, come quietly.

651
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.409
You big chrome cock-gobbler!

652
00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:05.459
That's not nice.

653
00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:07.110
You're really gonna fuck this up for me?

654
00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.580
Trust me, that wheezing bag
of dick-tips has it coming.

655
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.019
He's pure evil.

656
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.720
Besides.

657
00:38:16.534 --> 00:38:18.033
Nobody's getting hurt.

658
00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.299
That guy was already up there
when I got here.

659
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.330
Wade, you are better than this.

660
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.200
Join us. Use your powers for good.

661
00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:32.269
Heads up.

662
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:33.739
Be a superhero.

663
00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:34.609
Listen!

664
00:38:34.922 --> 00:38:37.279
The day I decide to become
a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,

665
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.579
who rooms with a bunch of other little
whiners at the neverland mansion

666
00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.956
of some creepy, old, bald,

667
00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.219
heaven's gate-looking motherfucker,

668
00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.689
on that day!

669
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.689
I'll send your shiny,
happy ass a friend request.

670
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:52.159
But until then, I'mma do
what I came here to do.

671
00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.959
Either that or slap the bitch outta you!

672
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.229
Wade.
Hey.

673
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.399
Zip it, sinead!

674
00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.460
Hey, douche-pool!

675
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:59.970
And I hope you're watching...

676
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.170
Quite unfortunate.

677
00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.480
That does it!

678
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:17.420
Canada!

679
00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.119
That's not good.

680
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.289
Wade, please.

681
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:22.489
Cock shot!

682
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.029
Oh, your poor wife.

683
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.760
You really should stop.

684
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:33.430
All the dinosaurs feared the T.Rex.

685
00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.570
I promise this gets
worse for you, big boy!

686
00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.439
This is embarrassing.

687
00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.409
Please, stay down.

688
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:48.010
You ever hear of the one-legged
man in the ass-kicking contest?

689
00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.419
Do you have off switch?

690
00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.180
Yeah, it's right next to the prostate.

691
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.319
Or is that the on switch?

692
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.320
Enough!

693
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.299
Let us go talk to the professor.

694
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.169
Mcavoy or Stewart?

695
00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:09.400
These timelines are so confusing.

696
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.369
Dead or alive, you're coming with me!

697
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.239
You will recover, Wade.

698
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.940
You always do.

699
00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:23.447
You ever see 127 hours?

700
00:40:23.572 --> 00:40:24.804
Spoiler alert.

701
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:29.760
Oh, my god.

702
00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:30.760
Nasty.

703
00:40:34.161 --> 00:40:35.880
There's the money shot baby.

704
00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:38.460

It's me, Margaret.

Nothing warms my heart more than
a change of someone else's.

You finally hit fuck it.

Just promise you'll do right by me.

714
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.609
So I can do right by someone else.

Of course.

716
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:25.810
And please don't make
the super-suit green.

717
00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:28.210
Or animated.

718
00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.390
Move it! Keep moving.

719
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.239
This place seems sanitary.

720
00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.339
My first request is warmer hands.

721
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.248
And Jesus,

722
00:41:55.473 --> 00:41:56.764
a warmer table.

723
00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.110
We should really come up
with a safe word, fellas.

724
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.850
I'm thinking pork and beans.

725
00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.350
Easy.

726
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.560
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?

727
00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:14.860
I'm calling Wang.

728
00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.269
What's up with the matches?

729
00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:23.300
Oral fixation or just a big Stallone fan?

730
00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:25.770
Patience Angel.

731
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:28.170
All in good time.

732
00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.380
Are you here for
the turndown service or what?

733
00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.349
We have another talker.

734
00:42:33.373 --> 00:42:35.310
I'm just excited about my
first day at superhero camp.

735
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.920
Shut the fuck up.

736
00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.690
Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax.

737
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.189
I manage this workshop.

738
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.959
My welcome speech used
to be full of euphemisms like...

739
00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:51.599
This may hurt a little.

740
00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.869
This may cause you some discomfort.

741
00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:55.269
But I've grown blunt.

742
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:58.700
This workshop is not
a government-led program.

743
00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.209
It's a private institution,

744
00:43:00.233 --> 00:43:03.022
that turns reclamation projects
like yourself into men of...

745
00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:05.804
extraordinary abilities.

746
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.320
But if you think super-human
powers are acquired painlessly...

747
00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:12.890
wrong.

748
00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:14.650
I'm injecting you with a serum,

749
00:43:14.674 --> 00:43:17.059
that activates any mutant
genes lurking in your DNA.

750
00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.173
For it to work we need to...

751
00:43:19.198 --> 00:43:20.291
subject you to...

752
00:43:20.516 --> 00:43:21.608
extreme stress.

753
00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:28.193
You've heard that whole,

754
00:43:28.218 --> 00:43:30.324
make an omelet break
some eggs bit, right?

755
00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:32.669
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.

756
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:35.739
I was a patient here once
myself, you know.

757
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.909
The treatment affects
everyone differently.

758
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.949
It made Angel inhumanly strong.

759
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:43.872
In my case,

760
00:43:44.097 --> 00:43:46.074
it enhanced my reflexes.

761
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.790
Also scorched my nerve endings,
so I no longer feel pain.

762
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:53.072
And in fact,

763
00:43:54.097 --> 00:43:55.554
I no longer feel anything.

764
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:05.575
Thanks! Thank you.

765
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.239
Thank you.

766
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.779
You have something in your teeth.

767
00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.779
Right in the middle there.
Just, I don't...

768
00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.880
A little nugget of romaine
lettuce or something.

769
00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.790
It's been bothering me for a long time.

770
00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.289
Made you look.

771
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:25.889
Hey, is Ajax your actual name
Because it sounds suspiciously made up.

772
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:27.511
What is it really? Kevin?

773
00:44:27.836 --> 00:44:29.299
Bruce? Scott?

774
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.099
Mitch? The Rickster?

775
00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.169
Is it basil fawlty?

776
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.030
Oh, joke away.

777
00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:38.239
One thing that never survives
this place is a sense of humor.

778
00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.209
We'll see about that.

779
00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:41.570
I suppose we will.

780
00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.240
He's all yours.

781
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:45.709
Oh, come on.

782
00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:47.710
You're gonna leave me all alone here.

783
00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.480
With less-angry Rosie O'Donnell?

784
00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.419
This is how it's going to work.

785
00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.929
Adrenaline acts as a catalyst
for the serum so...

786
00:44:59.453 --> 00:45:01.290
We're going to have to make you suffer.

787
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:04.196
If you're lucky,

788
00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:08.670
the mutant genes will activate
and manifest in a spectacular fashion.

789
00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.740
If not, well we'll have
to keep on hurting you...

790
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.410
In new and different ways
each more painful than the last.

791
00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.720
Until you finally mutate.

792
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:28.090
Or die.

793
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.629
You mean a bucket list?

794
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.299
Like a fuck it list.

795
00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.899
I'd really like to light a spliff
off the olympic torch.

796
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.239
Pass it to me right after.

797
00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.653
Let's not forget,

798
00:45:45.778 --> 00:45:47.539
naked tandem base-jumping

799
00:45:47.563 --> 00:45:50.140
with the wnba's Sacramento monarchs.

800
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.449
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

801
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:57.580
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter-Birney a Dutch oven.

802
00:45:57.593 --> 00:46:01.450
No. Receiving a Dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter-Birney.

803
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:06.930
Making banana pancakes...

804
00:46:07.655 --> 00:46:08.954
for my kids.

805
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:13.730
Vanessa.

806
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:19.809
I wanna see Vanessa.

807
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.039
You're lovely.

808
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.785
I don't know about anyone else but,

809
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:25.133
I'm touched.

810
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:26.549
We were just joking.

811
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.680
No, no. It's ok.

812
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:31.519
I encourage distractions.

813
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.519
Wouldn't want you giving up
on us, now would we?

814
00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.760
Hey, don't take any shit
from him, Cunningham.

815
00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:39.029
How tough can he be...

816
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.830
With a name like Francis?

817
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:44.660
Francis?

818
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.469
That's his legal name.

819
00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:49.940
He got Ajax from the dish soap.

820
00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:56.240
F, r, a, n, c, i...

821
00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:02.450
Snagged the dry cleaning tag
off your lab coat.

822
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:06.789
FYI, I could probably get you
the superhero discount.

823
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.559
You are so relentlessly annoying.

824
00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:09.589
Thanks.

825
00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:11.020
Never heard that before.

826
00:47:11.021 --> 00:47:13.690
Why don't you do us all a
favor and shut the fuck up?

827
00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.360
Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.

828
00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:19.729
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

829
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.999
See here's the problem with
round the clock torture is that,

830
00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.940
you can't really step it up from there.

831
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.910
Is that what you think?

832
00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.720
If this doesn't unlock
your mutation then well...

833
00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:40.719
Nothing will.

834
00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.459
Now, what we're going to do is lower
the oxygen concentration in the air,

835
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.859
to the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

836
00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.929
If your brainwaves slow
meaning you're about to pass out.

837
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:52.430
Then we'll turn up the O2.

838
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:56.369
If your heart rate slows meaning
you're able to catch your breath.

839
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:58.569
We'll turn it back down.

840
00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:00.939
And that's where we'll leave you.

841
00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.109
Right there.

842
00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:05.879
Oh, and I thought
you guys were dicks before.

843
00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.710
You know the funniest part of this?

844
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.580
You still think we're making
you a superhero.

845
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:15.820
You. A dishonorable discharge.

846
00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.060
Hip deep in hookers.

847
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.530
You're nothing.

848
00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.460
Little secret Wade.

849
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:26.099
This workshop doesn't make superheroes,

850
00:48:26.112 --> 00:48:27.799
we make super-slaves.

851
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.039
We're gonna fit you with a control collar

852
00:48:31.052 --> 00:48:33.009
and auction you off to the highest bidder.

853
00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.509
Who knows what they'll have you doing?

854
00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:39.010
Terrorizing citizens,
putting down freedom fighters.

855
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.449
Maybe just mow the occasional lawn.

856
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:47.020
What the fuck is wrong with you?

857
00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.559
You're never going home after this.

858
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.300
Now there's a brave face.

859
00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:00.570
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.

860
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:06.570
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.

861
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.939
Enjoy your weekend.

862
00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.240
Weekend? Back up.

863
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:13.380
Weekend?

864
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:57.089
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Did I say this was a love story?</i></font>

865
00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:59.690
<font color="#00ffff"><i>No, it's a horror movie.</i></font>

866
00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.879
Fucking hell.

867
00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:20.949
Looks like someone lost his
shot at homecoming king.

868
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:23.279
What have you done to me?

869
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.832
I've merely raised your stress levels
high enough to...

870
00:50:25.957 --> 00:50:27.149
trigger a mutation.

871
00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:29.119
You sadistic fuck!

872
00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.389
I've cured you Wade.

873
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:34.329
Now your mutated cells
can heal anything.

874
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:37.360
It's attacking your cancer
as fast as it can form.

875
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:41.030
Yeah, I've seen similar
side effects before.

876
00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.000
I could cure them...

877
00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.240
But where's the fun in that?

878
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:53.650
Now I'm gonna shut you
in again Wade.

879
00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.550
Not because I need to.

880
00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.490
Because I want to.

881
00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:18.970
Oh, well.

882
00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:20.610
Go ahead.

883
00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.440
Oh, you smell like shit.

884
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:29.919
Motherfucker.

885
00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.080
Hey, hey, hey.
It's all right, it's all right.

886
00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.319
I think we owe him that one, yeah?

887
00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:36.961
You take off.

888
00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:38.214
Go on.

889
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:39.990
Off you go.

890
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.500
Quick question.

891
00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.210
What's my name?

892
00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.220
Didn't think so.

893
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:08.720
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.</i></font>

894
00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:06.669
You don't want to kill me.

895
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:09.010
I'm the only one
who can fix your ugly mug.

896
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:07.100
What's my name?

897
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:14.770
Wade.

898
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:24.710
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I didn't just get the cure to El cancer,</i></font>

899
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:29.150
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I got the cure to El everything.</i></font>

900
00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.650
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But there was only one thing,</i></font>

901
00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:36.920
<font color="#00ffff"><i>that really mattered.</i></font>

902
00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.390
Come on, let's go.

903
00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:14.690
That must to hurt.

904
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:18.330
Thank you so much.

905
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:32.179
God, he's so fucking gnarly.

906
00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:33.549
Look at his face.

907
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.379
Oh, my god. Poor guy.

908
00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.219
Honey, don't stare.

909
00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.380
Freak.

910
00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:02.339
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.

911
00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:04.509
Come on Wade, it can't be that bad.

912
00:58:04.522 --> 00:58:06.079
Bullshit!

913
00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:07.767
I'm a monster inside and out.

914
00:58:07.792 --> 00:58:09.373
I belong in a fucking circus.

915
00:58:09.497 --> 00:58:10.778
Wade, Vanessa loves you.

916
00:58:11.103 --> 00:58:12.504
She doesn't care what you...

917
00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:15.189
Do you like what you see?

918
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:16.190
No.

919
00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:18.389
You look like an avocado

920
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:20.959
had sex with an older,
more disgusting avocado.

921
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:21.620
Yeah.

922
00:58:21.645 --> 00:58:23.623
Not gently like it was hate fucking.

923
00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.129
There was something wrong
with the relationship,

924
00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:28.069
and that was the only catharsis

925
00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:29.769
that they could find without violence.

926
00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:32.369
And the only guy
who can fix this fugly mug,

927
00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:35.009
Is the British shitstick
who ran the mutant factory.

928
00:58:35.022 --> 00:58:36.239
And he's gone.

929
00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.909
Yeah, well you gotta do something
to remedy this because as of now,

930
00:58:39.922 --> 00:58:41.762
you only have one course of action.

931
00:58:41.786 --> 00:58:43.149
Damn straight.

932
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:45.119
Find Francis.
Star in horror films.

933
00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.120
What?

934
00:58:46.121 --> 00:58:48.189
Star in your own horror films.

935
00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:51.920
Because you look like Freddy Krueger
face fucked a topographical map of Utah.

936
00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:54.790
Here's what I'm actually gonna do.

937
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.409
I'm gonna work through his crew
until somebody gives up Francis,

938
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:59.999
force him to fix this,
then put a bullet in his skull,

939
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.769
and fuck the brain hole.

940
00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:04.300
I don't wanna see that
or think of it again.

941
00:59:04.413 --> 00:59:07.009
But, the douchebag does
thinks you're dead, right?

942
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:08.546
Yeah.
That's good.

943
00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:09.809
You should keep it that way.

944
00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:11.309
What like, wear a mask?

945
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:13.550
Yes. A very thick mask.

946
00:59:13.551 --> 00:59:14.734
All the time.

947
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:18.119
I am sorry, you are haunting.

948
00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.819
Your face is the stuff of nightmares.

949
00:59:20.832 --> 00:59:22.319
Like a testicle with teeth.

950
00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.859
You will die alone.

951
00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.620
I mean, if you could die.

952
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.390
Ideally, for others' sake.

953
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.429
That'll do.

954
00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:32.322
All you need now is a suit
and a nickname like,

955
00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:33.829
Wade the Wisecracker.

956
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:35.550
Or Scaredevil,

957
00:59:35.775 --> 00:59:37.094
Mr. Neverdie.

958
00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.000
Oh, shit.

959
00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:40.570
What?

960
00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:43.579
I put all my money on you and now,

961
00:59:43.692 --> 00:59:45.179
I just realized I'm never gonna win the...

962
00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:46.280
Dead Pool.

963
00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.480
Captain Deadpool.

964
00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:55.350
No just...

965
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:56.789
Just Deadpool, yeah.

966
00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:58.759
To you, Mr. Pool.

967
00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.300
Deadpool. That sounds like
a fucking franchise.

968
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.840
This shit's gonna have nuts in it.

969
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:20.980
Where's Francis?

970
01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.060
Where's Francis?

971
01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:47.110
Seltzer water and lemon for blood,

972
01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:49.407
or wear red.

973
01:00:49.921 --> 01:00:51.093
Dumbass.

974
01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.330
Don't make me ask twice.

975
01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:13.929
Where...

976
01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:15.969
is Francis?

977
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:18.400
He made me ask twice.

978
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:20.370
Is the mask muffling my voice?

979
01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:26.950
Where's Francis?

980
01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.350
Where the fuck is Francis?

981
01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.229
You're about to be killed
by a zamboni.

982
01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:44.560
Where's Francis?

983
01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:47.369
No! Please!

984
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:50.600
Oh, god! I'm so sorry!

985
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:54.170
Oh! You little spider monkey!

986
01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.350
Where... is... Francis?

987
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:03.349
This is confusing.

988
01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:04.579
Is it sexist to hit you?

989
01:02:04.592 --> 01:02:06.349
Is it more sexist to not hit you?

990
01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:07.828
I mean, the line gets real...

991
01:02:08.053 --> 01:02:08.745
blurry.

992
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.900
Where is Francis?

993
01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:14.559
Tell me where your fucking boss is

994
01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.829
or you're gonna die!

995
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.160
In five minutes!

996
01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:29.610
Don't hesitate to call me.

997
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:47.330
Nice to see you, Jared.

998
01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.229
I'll take the footlong.

999
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:51.700
Fully loaded.

1000
01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:08.879
41 confirmed kills.

1001
01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.350
Now it's 89. About to be 90.

1002
01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.349
Mr. Wilson?

1003
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:14.350
Ding-ding.

1004
01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.559
You're looking very alive.

1005
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.520
Only on the outside!

1006
01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:21.489
This is not going
to end well for me, is it?

1007
01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:22.790
This is not gonna end well for you, no.

1008
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.159
Where's your boss?

1009
01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.760
I can tell you exactly...

1010
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:28.631
Oh you'll tell me.

1011
01:03:28.756 --> 01:03:29.623
But first...

1012
01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.569
You might wanna look away for this.

1013
01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:33.670
Now this little piggy went to...

1014
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.680
Thank you, agent Smith.

1015
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:42.580
Taxi!

1016
01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.020
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

1017
01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:49.730
And we all know how this turned out.

1018
01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.790
<font color="#00ffff"><i>You weren't meant to see that.</i></font>

1019
01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:04.470
There. All caught up.

1020
01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:13.649
We're here.

1021
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:18.520
Sorry about bleeding in all your garbage.

1022
01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:26.790
Seltzer water and lemon for blood.

1023
01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:31.159
Some kinds of anger can't be managed...

1024
01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:35.043
Like the kind where your year
long plan ends with the wrong guy

1025
01:04:35.068 --> 01:04:36.587
getting dismembered!

1026
01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.448
That said,

1027
01:04:38.673 --> 01:04:41.795
when it comes time to licking
wounds there's no place like home.

1028
01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.579
And I share that home
with someone you've met,

1029
01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.949
the old blind lady
from the laundromat, Al.

1030
01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.049
God, I miss cocaine.

1031
01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:50.329
Her.

1032
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:53.819
Fourth-wall break
inside a fourth-wall break.

1033
01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.238
That's like...

1034
01:04:55.663 --> 01:04:56.843
16 walls.

1035
01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.833
She's like Robin to my Batman
except she's old,

1036
01:05:00.158 --> 01:05:02.277
and black, and blind.

1037
01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:04.359
And I think she's in love with me.

1038
01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.570
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Wait, pretty sure Robin loves Batman too.</i></font>

1039
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.280
Al?

1040
01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:22.810
Morning sleepyhead.

1041
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.680
It smells like old lady pants in here.

1042
01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:28.689
Yes, I'm old. I wear pants.

1043
01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:30.259
But you're no lady.

1044
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.520
So comfy.

1045
01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:36.890
Upside of being blind,
I've never seen you in crocs.

1046
01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.429
You mean my big
rubber masturbating shoes?

1047
01:05:38.453 --> 01:05:39.453
Yes, I know.

1048
01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:41.499
Downside of being blind.

1049
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.270
I hear everything in this duplex.

1050
01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:48.539
Sit on a stick.

1051
01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.540
Bactin?

1052
01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:50.580
Yeah.

1053
01:05:51.227 --> 01:05:53.024
Bactin should do it.

1054
01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:56.579
How's that kullen coming along?

1055
01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:58.680
Ikea doesn't assemble itself, you know.

1056
01:05:58.690 --> 01:05:59.917
You're telling me.

1057
01:06:00.342 --> 01:06:01.689
I don't mind the kullen.

1058
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:03.519
It's an improvement on the hurdal.

1059
01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:06.659
Please. Anything's an
improvement over the hurdal.

1060
01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:10.359
I'd have taken an hemnes
or a trysil over the hurdal.

1061
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.829
Oh no, I didn't get excited
till I saw the kullen.

1062
01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:14.999
Screw, please.

1063
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.569
Here? Now? Just kidding.

1064
01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:17.739
I know it's been decades.

1065
01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.900
You'd be surprised.

1066
01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:20.770
Pretty grossed out.

1067
01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:33.789
I wish I never heard of craigslist.

1068
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:37.419
And I quote, looking for roommate,
blind to life's imperfections.

1069
01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.589
Must be good with hands or would you
rather I build the Ikea, and you pay rent?

1070
01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:42.260
Why such a douche this morning?

1071
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:44.329
Let's recap.

1072
01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:46.529
The cock thistle that
turned me into this freak.

1073
01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:48.330
Slipped through my arms today.

1074
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Arm.

1075
01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:54.869
Catching him was my only chance to be
hot again, get my super sexy ex back,

1076
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:57.139
and prevent this shit from
happening to someone else.

1077
01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:58.250
So yeah,

1078
01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.493
today was about as much
fun as a sandpaper dildo.

1079
01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.050
Hash tag drive by.

1080
01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.930
Found out who our friend
in the red suit is.

1081
01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:27.939
Fucking Wade Wilson.

1082
01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.640
I suppose I'd wear a mask too
if I had a face like that.

1083
01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:33.710
I only wish I healed the same.

1084
01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:38.317
Still,

1085
01:07:38.742 --> 01:07:40.243
we'll put him out of our misery.

1086
01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:41.819
On our terms.

1087
01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.590
Right. And when he heals?

1088
01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:45.920
He can't.

1089
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:48.059
Not if there's nothing
left of him to heal.

1090
01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:49.728
You know it's funny.

1091
01:07:51.042 --> 01:07:52.514
I almost miss the fucker.

1092
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.300
I like a challenge.

1093
01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.269
But he's bad for business.

1094
01:07:58.970 --> 01:08:00.510
Now let's go find him.

1095
01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:06.709
Tylenol PM?

1096
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:09.510
You can stick that
where you stuck the bactin.

1097
01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.979
I raided my stash
of wisdom tooth Percocet,

1098
01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:16.050
and I am orbiting
fucking saturn right now.

1099
01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:20.829
But I appreciate the gesture.

1100
01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:23.064
Am I crazy,

1101
01:08:23.389 --> 01:08:26.229
or is your hand really small?

1102
01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:28.470
About the size of a KFC spork.

1103
01:08:30.370 --> 01:08:31.900
I get why you're so pissy.

1104
01:08:32.610 --> 01:08:35.609
But your mood's never gonna brighten
till you find this woman,

1105
01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:36.870
and tell her how you feel.

1106
01:08:36.894 --> 01:08:38.479
What do I keep telling you, Mrs. Magoo?

1107
01:08:38.503 --> 01:08:39.809
She wouldn't have me.

1108
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:42.149
If you could see me, you'd understand.

1109
01:08:42.150 --> 01:08:43.479
Looks aren't everything.

1110
01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.619
Looks are everything.

1111
01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.219
You ever heard David Beckham speak?

1112
01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.950
It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium.

1113
01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:50.619
You think Ryan Reynolds got this far

1114
01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:52.389
on his superior acting method?

1115
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:53.659
Love is blind, Wade.

1116
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:54.660
No.

1117
01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:56.999
You're blind.

1118
01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.669
So, you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?

1119
01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:02.869
No, I'm gonna wait till this
arm plows through puberty,

1120
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:05.110
and then I'm gonna come up with
a whole new Christmas day plan.

1121
01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:07.069
In the meantime,

1122
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:08.670
you might wanna leave the room.

1123
01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.280
I bet it feels huge in this hand.

1124
01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.879
So, the doctor says, the bad news is

1125
01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.130
you don't have that long to live.

1126
01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:20.689
So the patient says how long do I have?

1127
01:09:20.713 --> 01:09:22.250
The doctor says five.

1128
01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:23.989
The guy says five what?

1129
01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:27.690
The doctor says, four, three, two...

1130
01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.830
Can I help you ladies?

1131
01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:40.840
Oh, I do hope so.

1132
01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.699
I heard you might be able
to point me in the direction of a...

1133
01:09:47.824 --> 01:09:49.003
friend of mine.

1134
01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.750
Name of Wade Wilson.

1135
01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.149
Sorry.

1136
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:54.890
I don't know the name.

1137
01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.230
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.

1138
01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:09.599
I've seen this girl.

1139
01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.699
Francis: This must be Vanessa.

1140
01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.900
I've heard so much about you.

1141
01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:19.279
Sweetheart, you might wanna
look around.

1142
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.450
This isn't really the place
to do something like that.

1143
01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:24.919
Easy Angel.

1144
01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:26.780
Put the little man down.

1145
01:10:28.690 --> 01:10:30.219
We have everything we need now.

1146
01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.020
You sure?

1147
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:35.029
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

1148
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:38.030
Have fun at your midnight
showing of blade II.

1149
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.800
Thanks for having my back, guys.

1150
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:51.139
Wade, we have a fucking problem.

1151
01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.609
And by we, I mean you.

1152
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:55.309
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1153
01:10:56.050 --> 01:10:58.980
So is there a word for
half afraid, half angry?

1154
01:10:58.990 --> 01:11:00.649
Yeah, afrangry, I guess.

1155
01:11:01.150 --> 01:11:03.019
Have you decided what
you're gonna say to her?

1156
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:04.289
Fuck me!

1157
01:11:04.290 --> 01:11:06.190
Maybe not start with that.

1158
01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:15.399
<i>Hey, coming onto our stage right now.</i>

1159
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.800
<i>Give it up for chastity!</i>

1160
01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:23.909
Or as I like to call her, Irony.

1161
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:26.040
Better find her fast before numbnuts does.

1162
01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:27.679
How do you know she's in here?

1163
01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.350
Because I'm constantly stalking that fox.

1164
01:11:55.810 --> 01:11:58.979
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Every time I see her,
it's like the first time.</i></font>

1165
01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.880
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Especially from this angle.</i></font>

1166
01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:27.100
<i>You can't buy love,</i>

1167
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:29.710
<i>but you can rent it
for three minutes.</i>

1168
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:35.150
You weak motherfucker!

1169
01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.280
Come on!

1170
01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:39.849
Come on, get it together.

1171
01:12:39.850 --> 01:12:41.620
This isn't about me,
this is about Vanessa.

1172
01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.090
Here we go.

1173
01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:51.360
Maximum effort.

1174
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.070
Vanessa.

1175
01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:00.339
Someone out back asking for you.

1176
01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:02.510
Something about, an old boyfriend.

1177
01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.270
I knew it was you.

1178
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:34.910
The weird, curvy edges.

1179
01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.410
Like a Jigsaw puzzle.

1180
01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.390
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.

1181
01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:00.930
Hey. Hey! Where'd she go?

1182
01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:03.030
I saw her head to the back.

1183
01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.400
Go get her, tiger.

1184
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.560
Fuck. Fuck!

1185
01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.199
Motherfucker!

1186
01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.329
Wait, wait. Let's... just...

1187
01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:36.399
Cock juggling...

1188
01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.469
We can talk about what we're gonna...

1189
01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:38.499
Jiminy! Fuck face!

1190
01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.939
Ok, or you can hit that.

1191
01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:41.739
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fuck! Fuck!

1192
01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.109
No, no.
All right. Hey!

1193
01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:44.979
Fuck! Fuck!
Hey!

1194
01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.109
Fuck!
Hey...

1195
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:48.810
Relax. Relax. Ok.

1196
01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.410
Ok. I think that's a good start.

1197
01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.480
Oh, I'm gonna rip his motherfucking...

1198
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:53.549
Wait.

1199
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.219
Find it! Find it.
What?

1200
01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:57.089
I'm gonna get angry.
Ok. All right.

1201
01:14:57.090 --> 01:14:58.959
All right. Ok. All right.

1202
01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:00.259
Here. This is Vanessa.

1203
01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.289
What? No, wait. It's Francis.

1204
01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:04.399
He wants you to come to him.

1205
01:15:04.423 --> 01:15:05.099
What is that?

1206
01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.660
That's the shit emoji.

1207
01:15:06.684 --> 01:15:08.899
You know, it's the turd with
the smiling face and the eyes?

1208
01:15:08.923 --> 01:15:11.340
I thought it was chocolate
yogurt for so long.

1209
01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.069
I need guns.

1210
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:14.400
Ok, which ones?

1211
01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:15.539
I need all the guns!

1212
01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.810
All right. Ok.

1213
01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:39.100
That's about 3,000 rounds.

1214
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:41.999
We all know what I can do with 12.

1215
01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.569
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie milsap!

1216
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:45.740
We're downrange.

1217
01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.669
I was gonna spend the night

1218
01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:51.409
assembling the borje,
but this is holding my interest.

1219
01:15:51.810 --> 01:15:54.609
I told you, we're going with
the urvaj, not the borje.

1220
01:15:54.822 --> 01:15:56.710
Get it through your head
or get out of fuck town.

1221
01:15:56.723 --> 01:15:57.412
Shit.

1222
01:15:57.737 --> 01:15:59.204
That's all the pieces in the house.

1223
01:15:59.228 --> 01:16:00.139
No, no, no, no Come on.

1224
01:16:00.164 --> 01:16:01.284
Let's go. Cough it up.

1225
01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.090
Up, up, up, up, up.

1226
01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:05.859
Down, down. Down, down.

1227
01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.020
Fuck you.

1228
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:11.230
45 Cal. I like it.

1229
01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:14.600
Wade.

1230
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.319
I'd go with you but...

1231
01:16:17.744 --> 01:16:18.994
I don't want to.

1232
01:16:21.818 --> 01:16:22.718
Hey...

1233
01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.440
Listen Al...

1234
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:27.179
If I never see you again,

1235
01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.219
I want you to know that
I love you very much.

1236
01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.657
And also...

1237
01:16:33.801 --> 01:16:36.619
there's about 116 kilos of cocaine
buried somewhere in the apartment,

1238
01:16:36.643 --> 01:16:39.160
Right next to the cure
for blindness. Good luck.

1239
01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.530
You wanna get fucked up?

1240
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:57.880
Put her down over here.

1241
01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:09.390
Go on then.

1242
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:13.123
Thanks, dickless.

1243
01:17:13.348 --> 01:17:14.413
And I mean you.

1244
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:17.011
Well. You're a talker too.

1245
01:17:17.036 --> 01:17:18.123
You and Wade.

1246
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.029
I've been trying to tell you assholes,

1247
01:17:20.053 --> 01:17:21.529
you've got the wrong girl.

1248
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:23.230
My old boyfriend, he's dead.

1249
01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.689
See, I thought that too.

1250
01:17:24.914 --> 01:17:26.524
But he keeps on coming back.

1251
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:27.969
Like a cockroach.

1252
01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:29.339
But uglier.

1253
01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.425
Now,

1254
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:34.103
I may not feel but he does.

1255
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.220
Let's see how he fights
with your head on the block.

1256
01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:47.520
Ripley, from alien 3!

1257
01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.730
Fuck, you're old.

1258
01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.729
Fake laugh. Hiding real pain.

1259
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:55.369
Go get silver balls.

1260
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:56.691
You guys going for a bite?

1261
01:17:56.816 --> 01:17:57.839
Early bird special?

1262
01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:00.700
Like there's something wrong with
eating before sundown or saving money.

1263
01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:03.640
No, you know that bad guy
that you let go?

1264
01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.009
He's got my girl.

1265
01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:08.149
You're gonna help me
get her back.

1266
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:10.149
Wade, is that you?

1267
01:18:10.173 --> 01:18:11.819
Yeah, it's me, Deadpool,

1268
01:18:11.843 --> 01:18:14.450
and I got an offer
that you can't refuse.

1269
01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.459
I'm gonna wait out here, ok?

1270
01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.810
It's a big house. It's funny
that I only ever see two of you.

1271
01:18:20.834 --> 01:18:21.770
It's almost like,

1272
01:18:21.995 --> 01:18:23.964
the studio couldn't
afford another x-man.

1273
01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:28.929
And that is why, in my opinion,

1274
01:18:29.042 --> 01:18:31.669
the movie cocoon is pure pornography.

1275
01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:34.639
Who brought this twinkly man?

1276
01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.739
Twinkly, but deadly.

1277
01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:39.340
My chrome-penised friend back there,

1278
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:41.149
has agreed to do me this solid.

1279
01:18:41.173 --> 01:18:45.479
In exchange, I said that I would
consider joining his boy band.

1280
01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.749
It's not boy band.

1281
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:48.189
Sure it's not.

1282
01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:51.119
So, any luck winning Gita back?

1283
01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:53.920
I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool but...

1284
01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:57.759
Bandhu is more craftier
and handsomer than me.

1285
01:18:57.783 --> 01:19:00.300
Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.

1286
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:07.200
Dopinder.

1287
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:10.170
What was that?

1288
01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.755
That was...

1289
01:19:15.269 --> 01:19:17.823
Bandhu in the trunk.

1290
01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:19.749
Ban who?

1291
01:19:19.773 --> 01:19:21.368
My romantic rival Bandhu.

1292
01:19:21.493 --> 01:19:22.519
He's tied up in the trunk.

1293
01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.289
I'm doing as you said, DP.

1294
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:26.189
I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish,

1295
01:19:26.213 --> 01:19:28.490
then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.

1296
01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.159
I did not tell him to do that.

1297
01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:32.046
Absolutely not.

1298
01:19:32.071 --> 01:19:33.760
It got lost in translation.

1299
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:37.069
Dopinder, this is no way
to win Gita's heart back!

1300
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:38.199
I'm so proud of you.

1301
01:19:38.223 --> 01:19:40.439
Drop Bandhu off, safe and gentle-like.

1302
01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.509
Kill him.

1303
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:43.470
And then win Gita back.

1304
01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.440
The old fashioned way
with your boyish charm.

1305
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:47.850
Kidnap her.

1306
01:19:49.450 --> 01:19:50.650
He's super dead.

1307
01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.689
I presume a crisp high five?

1308
01:19:57.690 --> 01:19:59.459
For you? 10.

1309
01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:03.029
Ok guys, let's get out there
and make a difference.

1310
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:04.900
You know what to do.

1311
01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:08.170
Knock them dead, pool boy!

1312
01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:12.240
Time to make the chimi fucking changas.

1313
01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:15.309
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Not often a dude ruins your face.</i></font>

1314
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:18.309
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Skull-stomps your sanity,
grabs your future baby mama.</i></font>

1315
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:19.979

1316
01:20:20.003 --> 01:20:21.979
<font color="#00ffff"><i>of your five shittiest moments.</i></font>

1317
01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.530
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Let's just say,</i></font>

1318
01:20:23.855 --> 01:20:26.804
<font color="#00ffff"><i>it's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.</i></font>

1319
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.600
Hey.

1320
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.200
Where's your duffle bag?

1321
01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:02.489
Bandhu?

1322
01:21:04.190 --> 01:21:06.259
<i>Leave a message
and have a happy day.</i>

1323
01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:07.520
God damn it!

1324
01:21:07.630 --> 01:21:09.189
I'm gonna do this the old fashioned way.

1325
01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:10.219
With two swords...

1326
01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:12.843
and maximum effort.

1327
01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:14.870
Cue the music.

1328
01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.019
Wade Wilson!

1329
01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.249
What's my name?

1330
01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:37.850
Oh, I'mma fucking spell it out for ya.

1331
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:41.259
Go get some.

1332
01:21:41.283 --> 01:21:42.329
Superhero landing.

1333
01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:43.559
She's gonna do a superhero landing.

1334
01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:44.730
Wait for it.

1335
01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:50.399
Superhero landing!

1336
01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.250
You know, that's really
hard on your knees.

1337
01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:53.969
Totally impractical.
They all do it.

1338
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:57.439
You're a lovely lady, but
I'm saving myself for Francis.

1339
01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:58.839
That's why I brought him.

1340
01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:02.180
I prefer not to hit a woman,
so please put...

1341
01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:09.990
I mean,

1342
01:22:10.315 --> 01:22:11.914
that's why I brought her?

1343
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:15.959
Oh no finish your tweet.
It's not... that's...

1344
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.259
Just give us a second. Yeah.

1345
01:22:17.283 --> 01:22:18.700
Hey you hashtag it...

1346
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:21.570
Go get her, tiger.

1347
01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:32.280
I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.

1348
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:35.010
All right, then.
Fire!

1349
01:22:46.630 --> 01:22:48.359
Finish fucking her the fuck up!

1350
01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.459
Language, please.

1351
01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:50.690
Suck a cock.

1352
01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:17.820
Look away, child.

1353
01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.060
Look away!

1354
01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:28.470
Wait!

1355
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:29.800
Wait!

1356
01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.169
Cease fire!

1357
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:32.369
Cease fire!

1358
01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:34.300
Fellas! Hey! Hey!

1359
01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:38.779
You only work for that
shit-spackled muppet fart.

1360
01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:41.240
So, I'mma give you a chance....

1361
01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:43.210
for y'all to lay down your firearms,

1362
01:23:43.234 --> 01:23:46.280
In exchange for preferential,
bordering on gentle.

1363
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:47.521
Possibly...

1364
01:23:47.946 --> 01:23:49.674
even lover-like treatment.

1365
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:52.890
Fine.

1366
01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:54.360
Commando!

1367
01:25:06.370 --> 01:25:07.500
Teabag!

1368
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:12.870
Bob?

1369
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:14.870
Wade?

1370
01:25:14.894 --> 01:25:16.370
Oh my god, I haven't seen you since...

1371
01:25:16.371 --> 01:25:18.280
Jacksonville. Fridays.
Since TGI Fridays.

1372
01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.109
Well, what the hell!

1373
01:25:21.710 --> 01:25:23.180
God, come here you.

1374
01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:27.149
How are the kids? Good?

1375
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:29.189
And Gail she still fixing
that tuna casserole?

1376
01:25:29.213 --> 01:25:31.519
So good. But bad for the waistline,

1377
01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.880
if you know what I'm talking about.

1378
01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.729
Your... on the left.
You are beautiful woman.

1379
01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:43.900
That is so sweet.

1380
01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.200
Thanks.

1381
01:25:58.450 --> 01:25:59.920
Does he write you notes too?

1382
01:26:00.021 --> 01:26:01.819
He's such a romantic.

1383
01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:03.820
Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.

1384
01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:06.160
Fire!

1385
01:26:13.770 --> 01:26:14.770
Hey!

1386
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:16.600
Climb on!

1387
01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:54.770
Motherfucking.

1388
01:27:06.490 --> 01:27:08.950
Motherfucker should have
worn his brown pants.

1389
01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:12.920
You were right, beautiful.

1390
01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.330
Red really is my color.

1391
01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.159
Wade?

1392
01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:18.329
Don't worry baby.

1393
01:27:18.730 --> 01:27:20.529
I'mma get you out of that shit-box.

1394
01:27:21.130 --> 01:27:23.469
What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours?

1395
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:25.199
You never left.

1396
01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.339
But you did, asshole!

1397
01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.070
Deep breath, darling.

1398
01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:31.710
Oh, wait.

1399
01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:34.340
Wrong choice of words.

1400
01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:39.379
I hope they blocked pain
to your every last nerve.

1401
01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:40.720
Because I'mma go looking!

1402
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:44.219
I hear you grow back body parts now, Wade.

1403
01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:45.719
When I'm finished.

1404
01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:47.420
Parts will have to grow back you.

1405
01:27:47.530 --> 01:27:48.690
Good one.

1406
01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:50.990
Yep, that was a good one.

1407
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.660
Let's dance.

1408
01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.129
And by dance, I mean...

1409
01:27:55.130 --> 01:27:56.670
Let's try to kill each other.

1410
01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.059
Fine. Fists.

1411
01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.090
Oh, sounds like your last Saturday night.

1412
01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:19.280
Asshole!

1413
01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:17.099
Hang in there, baby!

1414
01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:18.100
Wade!

1415
01:31:18.324 --> 01:31:19.324
I gotcha!

1416
01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.870
I got a plan.
You're not gonna like it.

1417
01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.290
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1418
01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.830
Don't worry.
I'm totally on top of this.

1419
01:32:00.710 --> 01:32:01.740
Damn it!

1420
01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:05.780
Maximum effort!

1421
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:49.090
Thanks.

1422
01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:55.570
Just take it slow.

1423
01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.850
Oh, my god! That was so...

1424
01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:41.349
There are no words!

1425
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:43.283
Me and you,

1426
01:33:43.508 --> 01:33:45.905
are headed to fix this butterface.

1427
01:33:46.650 --> 01:33:47.720
What?

1428
01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:52.389
You stupid fucking idiot.

1429
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:55.215
Did you really think
there was a cure...

1430
01:33:56.929 --> 01:33:58.003
for that?

1431
01:33:59.930 --> 01:34:00.999
What?

1432
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:02.400
You heard me.

1433
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:05.130
No.

1434
01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:06.370
No!

1435
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:14.585
So,

1436
01:34:15.010 --> 01:34:16.634
you mean to say,

1437
01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.170
after all this,

1438
01:34:19.895 --> 01:34:21.513
you can't fix me?

1439
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:24.519
It sounds even stupider
when you say it.

1440
01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.459
Like the kind of stupid who admits

1441
01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:29.230
he can't do the one thing
I'm keeping him alive for?

1442
01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:34.960
Any last words?

1443
01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:38.430
What's my name?

1444
01:34:39.370 --> 01:34:40.500
Who fucking cares?

1445
01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:41.570
Wade!

1446
01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:45.079
Four or five moments.

1447
01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.080
I'm sorry?

1448
01:34:47.104 --> 01:34:49.540
Four or five moments,
that's all it takes.

1449
01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:51.250
To?

1450
01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:53.480
Be a hero.

1451
01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:58.319
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job.

1452
01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:00.720
Wake up a hero, brush your teeth a hero,

1453
01:35:00.730 --> 01:35:02.160
go to work a hero.

1454
01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:03.790
Not true.

1455
01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:09.329
Over a lifetime, there are only four
or five moments that really matter.

1456
01:35:10.230 --> 01:35:12.669
Moments when you're offered a choice.

1457
01:35:12.670 --> 01:35:15.239
To make a sacrifice, conquer a flaw,

1458
01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.670
save a friend...

1459
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:19.779
Spare an enemy.

1460
01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.240
In these moments.

1461
01:35:23.010 --> 01:35:25.919
Everything else falls away.

1462
01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:29.019
The way the world sees us.

1463
01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:30.490
The way we...

1464
01:35:34.630 --> 01:35:35.660
Why?

1465
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:38.799
You were droning on.

1466
01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:42.060
Sure, I may be stuck looking
like pepperoni flatbread.

1467
01:35:42.170 --> 01:35:44.399
But at least fuckface
won't heal from that.

1468
01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:47.569
If wearing superhero tights,

1469
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:49.669
means sparing psychopaths,

1470
01:35:49.670 --> 01:35:51.639
then maybe I wasn't meant
to wear them.

1471
01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:54.079
Not everyone monitors a hall like you.

1472
01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:55.479
Just promise.

1473
01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:57.893
Yeah, I'll be on the lookout
for the next...

1474
01:35:58.318 --> 01:35:59.449
four moments.

1475
01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:00.680
Oh, shit.

1476
01:36:01.190 --> 01:36:02.480
Now if you'll excuse me,

1477
01:36:02.905 --> 01:36:04.113
I'm just a boy,

1478
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:06.689
about to stand in front of a girl.

1479
01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:08.389
And tell her...

1480
01:36:08.490 --> 01:36:10.459
What the fuck am I gonna tell her?

1481
01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:11.428
Well...

1482
01:36:11.842 --> 01:36:13.344
you better figure it out.

1483
01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:16.629
I can't even tell you...

1484
01:36:16.630 --> 01:36:18.199
I deserved that.
That too.

1485
01:36:18.223 --> 01:36:20.269
No, no, no, no, no,
maybe, maybe not the nethers.

1486
01:36:20.370 --> 01:36:21.440
Start talking!

1487
01:36:24.010 --> 01:36:25.179
I'm sorry.

1488
01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.409
I'm so sorry.

1489
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:30.810
For everything,
I'm sorry for leaving...

1490
01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:34.449
I'm sorry for not
cowboying up sooner.

1491
01:36:34.450 --> 01:36:36.289
It's been rough couple of years.

1492
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:37.350
Rough?

1493
01:36:45.130 --> 01:36:46.660
I live in a crackhouse.

1494
01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:49.330
With a family of 12.

1495
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:52.739
Every night we spoon for warmth.

1496
01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:55.409
Everybody fights for Noelle.
She's the fattest.

1497
01:36:55.710 --> 01:36:57.270
There's nothing that we don't share.

1498
01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:59.443
Floor space, dental floss,

1499
01:37:00.268 --> 01:37:01.704
even condoms.

1500
01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:11.290
So, you live in a house.

1501
01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.930
I should have come
and found you sooner.

1502
01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:26.669
But, baby, the guy under this mask,

1503
01:37:26.670 --> 01:37:28.670
he ain't the same one
that you remember.

1504
01:37:33.610 --> 01:37:34.840
You mean this mask?

1505
01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:56.130
And this one.

1506
01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:59.840
In case the other fell off.

1507
01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:05.209
All right. Yeah, just...

1508
01:38:05.210 --> 01:38:06.809
Like a band-aid, just give it a...

1509
01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:09.049
Owdie 5,000.

1510
01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:10.280
Wait, wait, wait...

1511
01:38:12.150 --> 01:38:13.320
Are you sure?

1512
01:38:15.250 --> 01:38:16.320
I'm sure.

1513
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:30.200
Yeah.

1514
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:37.910
Hey.

1515
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:42.279
After a brief adjustment period,

1516
01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:44.380
and a bunch of drinks...

1517
01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:47.380
It's a face...

1518
01:38:52.590 --> 01:38:54.060
I'd be happy to sit on.

1519
01:39:01.670 --> 01:39:02.983
I'm not the same,

1520
01:39:03.208 --> 01:39:04.799
underneath this suit either.

1521
01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:06.300
No.

1522
01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.439
Super-penis.

1523
01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:10.439
Come on, Wade.
Language.

1524
01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.410
Young one is present.

1525
01:39:13.410 --> 01:39:16.340
What did... What are you still doing?
Get out of here.

1526
01:39:16.365 --> 01:39:17.949
Go make yourself useful!

1527
01:39:17.950 --> 01:39:20.819
You, go be a really
big brother to someone.

1528
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:23.156
Tell beast to stop shitting
on my lawn and you...

1529
01:39:23.281 --> 01:39:24.619
chicken noodle,

1530
01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:26.519
nothing compares to you.

1531
01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.120
Sinead o'Connor, 1990. Sorry.

1532
01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:29.734
That's all right.

1533
01:39:30.259 --> 01:39:31.484
You're cool.

1534
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:34.929
What in the ass?

1535
01:39:34.930 --> 01:39:36.715
That was not mean.

1536
01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:38.400
I'm proud of you!

1537
01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:41.569
We will make an x-man of you yet, Wade.

1538
01:39:41.670 --> 01:39:42.969
You know for a second there,

1539
01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:44.809
it felt like we were
three mini-lion robots.

1540
01:39:44.810 --> 01:39:47.240
Coming together
to form one super robot.

1541
01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:49.279
There's a stupid.

1542
01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.280
Yeah.

1543
01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:54.723
And now,

1544
01:39:56.048 --> 01:39:57.875
for the moment I've
all been waiting for.

1545
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:02.790
Come here.

1546
01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:13.644
Wham!

1547
01:40:14.369 --> 01:40:15.964
As promised.

You're still here?

1561
01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.192
It's over.

1562
01:47:13.817 --> 01:47:15.184
Go home.

1563
01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:19.229
Oh, you're expecting
a teaser for Deadpool 2.

1564
01:47:19.230 --> 01:47:20.960
Well, we don't have that kind of money.

1565
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:24.699
What are you expecting?
Sam Jackson to show up?

1566
01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:25.823
Eye patch and...

1567
01:47:26.448 --> 01:47:28.293
Saucy little leather number, go

1568
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:29.170
Go, go.

1569
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:38.310
But I can tell you one thing,
and it's a bit of a secret.

1570
01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:40.880
For the sequel, we're gonna have cable.

1571
01:47:41.490 --> 01:47:43.849
Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time travel.

1572
01:47:44.050 --> 01:47:45.219
We have no idea
who we're gonna cast yet,

1573
01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:46.350
but it could be anybody.

1574
01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:47.989
Just need a big guy with a flat top.

1575
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:49.789
Could be Mel Gibson,
Dolph Lundgren.

1576
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:52.029
Keira knightley.
She's got range. Who knows.

1577
01:47:52.230 --> 01:47:53.499
Anyway, big secret.

1578
01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:55.729
And don't leave your
garbage all lying around.

1579
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:58.230
It's a total dick move.

1580
01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:00.140
Go.
