1
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,502
Pull yourself together, Teddy.
Pull yourself together.

2
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:23,580
lt's just water.

3
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:26,789
lt's a lot of water.

4
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,826
A lot of...

5
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:33,728
Come on.

6
00:01:57,822 --> 00:02:00,916
-You okay, boss?
-Yeah, l'm fine, l just...

7
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:04,793
l just can't... Can't stomach the water.

8
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,995
-You're my new partner.
-That's right.

9
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:15,095
Not the best way to meet,
with my head halfway down the toilet.

10
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:18,198
Doesn't exactly square with
''Teddy Daniels, the man, the legend,''

11
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,744
-l'll give you that.
-The legend?

12
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:23,507
What the hell you boys smoking
over there in Portland, anyway?

13
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:26,948
Seattle. l came from
the office in Seattle.

14
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:31,849
How long you been with the Marshals?

15
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:33,355
Four years.

16
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,257
So you know how small it is.

17
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,754
Sure.

18
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:42,766
What about you?
You got a girl? Married?

19
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:44,829
l was.

20
00:02:56,981 --> 00:02:58,312
She died.

21
00:02:58,983 --> 00:03:02,282
-Jesus. l don't...
-Don't worry about it.

22
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:06,916
There was a fire at the apartment
building while l was at work.

23
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,720
Four people died.

24
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:12,661
lt was the smoke that got her,
not the fire. See, that's important.

25
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:14,425
l'm sorry, boss.

26
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:17,330
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

27
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:19,460
Oh, here, have one of mine.

28
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:23,063
l could've sworn they were
in my jacket before l got on.

29
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:25,836
Government employees
will rob you blind.

30
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:29,506
Thanks.

31
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:33,346
They give you a briefing about
the institution before you left?

32
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:36,079
All l know is it's a mental hospital.

33
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,014
For the criminally insane.

34
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:42,219
Well, if it's just folks running
around hearing voices

35
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:45,728
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

36
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:57,737
-ls that where we're headed?
-Yep.

37
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:00,642
The other side of the island
is rock bluffs

38
00:04:00,745 --> 00:04:03,270
all the way down
to the edge of the water.

39
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:06,817
The dock, it's the only way on or off.

40
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,888
We'll be casting off
as soon as you two are ashore.

41
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:13,583
l'd appreciate it if you'd hurry up about it.

42
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:16,387
-Why?
-Storm's coming.

43
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:45,414
Never seen a Marshals badge before.

44
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,990
l'm Deputy Warden McPherson,
gentlemen.

45
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:50,253
Welcome to Shutter lsland.

46
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:53,353
l'll be the one taking you
up to Ashecliffe.

47
00:05:05,677 --> 00:05:08,544
Your boys seem a little on edge,
Mr. McPherson.

48
00:05:08,646 --> 00:05:10,978
Right now, Marshal, we all are.

49
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:57,288
Electrified perimeter.

50
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:00,892
How can you tell?

51
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:03,791
l've seen something like it before.

52
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:36,260
All right. You gentlemen will
be accorded all the help we can give,

53
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:39,302
but during your stay,
you will obey protocol.

54
00:06:39,404 --> 00:06:40,769
ls that understood?

55
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:42,203
Absolutely.

56
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:46,040
The red brick building on your right
is Ward A, the male ward.

57
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:49,477
Ward B, the female ward,
is the one on your left.

58
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:52,516
Ward C is that building on the bluffs.

59
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:54,209
An old Civil War fort.

60
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,685
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

61
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:58,722
Admittance to Ward C is forbidden

62
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:01,451
without the written consent
and physical presence

63
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:04,084
of both myself and Dr. Cawley.

64
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:05,630
ls that understood?

65
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:05,925
ls that understood?

66
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:09,331
You act like insanity is catching.

67
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:15,467
You are hereby required
to surrender your firearms.

68
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:20,341
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

69
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,936
We are required to carry our firearms
with us at all times.

70
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:26,016
Executive order 319
of the Federal Code of Penitentiaries

71
00:07:26,117 --> 00:07:28,142
states that when inside a penitentiary,

72
00:07:28,252 --> 00:07:31,653
the officers of that institution
have final authority.

73
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:38,518
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

74
00:07:57,982 --> 00:08:01,281
Okay. Now that the official stuff's done,
come on, boys,

75
00:08:01,386 --> 00:08:03,286
what do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

76
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:18,028
When did she escape? This prisoner?

77
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:22,266
l'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have
to fill you in on the situation. Protocol.

78
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:24,500
Correctional officers
at a mental institution,

79
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:26,736
that's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying.

80
00:08:26,844 --> 00:08:30,245
lt's the only facility of its kind in the U.S.,
even the world.

81
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:32,873
We take only the most dangerous,
damaged patients,

82
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:34,918
ones no other hospital can manage.

83
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,919
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

84
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:38,921
He's created something
really unique here.

85
00:08:39,023 --> 00:08:42,584
lt's a hospital for people our society
normally considers beyond treatment.

86
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:09,119
Top of his class at Johns Hopkins,
then Harvard...

87
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:12,283
lDs, gentlemen.

88
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:17,920
Show your badges, gentlemen.

89
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:21,988
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times by Scotland Yard,

90
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,795
Ml5, the OSS...

91
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:25,493
Why?

92
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:27,195
What do you mean?

93
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:31,804
What do intelligence agencies
want to consult a psychiatrist about?

94
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:34,173
l guess you'll have to ask him.

95
00:09:44,055 --> 00:09:46,080
-Marshal Daniels.
-Doctor.

96
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:48,115
Marshal Aule.

97
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:51,288
Thank you, Deputy Warden.
That will be all.

98
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:54,023
Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen.

99
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,394
He had a lot to say about you.

100
00:09:57,502 --> 00:10:00,665
McPherson's a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

101
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:03,070
And what would that be, exactly?

102
00:10:03,174 --> 00:10:06,803
A moral fusion between law and order
and clinical care.

103
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:09,880
Pardon me, Doc.
A what between what and what?

104
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:19,914
Those paintings are quite accurate.

105
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:21,889
Used to be the kind of patients
we deal with here

106
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:25,156
were shackled and left in their own filth.

107
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:26,525
They were beaten,

108
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:28,861
as if whipping them bloody
would drive the psychosis out.

109
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:31,059
We drove screws into their brains,

110
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:34,935
we submerged them in icy water
until they lost consciousness

111
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:37,502
or even drowned.

112
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:39,542
-And now?
-We treat them.

113
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:41,839
Try to heal, try to cure.

114
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:43,573
And if that fails,
at least we provide them

115
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:46,912
with a measure of comfort
in their lives. Calm.

116
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:50,215
These are all violent offenders, right?

117
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:52,551
l mean, they've hurt people.

118
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:57,054
-Murdered them in some cases.
-ln almost all cases, yes.

119
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:58,992
Then, personally, Doctor,
l'd have to say,

120
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:01,428
screw their sense of calm.

121
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:05,228
lt's my job to treat my patients,
not their victims.

122
00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:06,803
l'm not here to judge.

123
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:09,498
-So this female prisoner...
-Patient.

124
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:12,241
Excuse me. Patient,

125
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:17,440
one Rachel Solando,
escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

126
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:19,778
Last night between 10:00 and midnight.

127
00:11:19,884 --> 00:11:21,408
ls she considered dangerous?

128
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,114
You could say that.
She killed all three of her children.

129
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,957
She drowned them in the lake
behind her house.

130
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,325
She took them out one by one,
held their heads under till they died,

131
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,263
then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

132
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:38,665
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

133
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,539
-And what about the husband?
-He died on the beaches of Normandy.

134
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:48,635
She's a war widow. She starved herself
when she first came here.

135
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:51,510
She insisted the children weren't dead.

136
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:04,121
Sorry, Doctor. You don't happen
to have an aspirin, do you?

137
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:05,889
Prone to headaches, Marshal?

138
00:12:05,997 --> 00:12:09,194
Sometimes. But today,
l'm a little more prone to seasickness.

139
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:11,194
Dehydration.

140
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:12,894
-You all right, boss?
-Yeah.

141
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:15,700
ln that case, you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

142
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:17,296
Thanks so much.

143
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:21,178
Rachel still believes
the children are alive.

144
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,510
She also believes this place is her home
in the Berkshires.

145
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:27,784
You're kidding me.

146
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,113
She's never once in two years

147
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,881
acknowledged that
she's in an institution.

148
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:34,822
She believes we're all deliverymen,
milkmen, postal workers.

149
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:37,121
To sustain the delusion
that her children never died,

150
00:12:37,228 --> 00:12:39,219
she's created
an elaborate fictional structure,

151
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,663
and she gives us all parts
to play in that fiction.

152
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:45,659
So have you searched the grounds yet?

153
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,330
The warden and his men
scoured the island.

154
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:49,906
Not a trace.

155
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:55,069
And what's more disturbing is we don't
know how she got out of her room.

156
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:58,945
lt was locked from the outside,
and the only window is barred.

157
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:05,220
lt's as if she evaporated
straight through the walls.

158
00:13:11,128 --> 00:13:14,962
l brought her right back here
after group therapy, locked her in,

159
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:18,035
came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

160
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:29,039
Seriously, Doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

161
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:32,047
l mean,
she's in a mental institution, right?

162
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,140
Seems like something you'd notice
from time to time.

163
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:36,378
How many pairs of shoes
are the patients given?

164
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:37,852
Two pairs.

165
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:42,187
Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.
You can't just choose to get over it.

166
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:45,694
So, she left here barefoot?

167
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:49,561
Come on, Doc, she couldn't get
10 yards in that terrain.

168
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:52,230
Marshal?

169
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,252
This is definitely Rachel's handwriting.

170
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:16,190
l have no idea
what the law of four is, though.

171
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:19,126
-lt's not a psychiatric term?
-l'm afraid not.

172
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,697
''Who is 67?''

173
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,024
Fuck if l know.

174
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:26,934
l have to say that's quite close
to my clinical conclusion.

175
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:28,938
Think it's just random scribblings?

176
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,771
Oh, no, not at all. Rachel's smart.
Brilliant, in fact.

177
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:34,310
This paper could be important.

178
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:37,245
Excuse me, Doctor,
but we're gonna have to hold on to this.

179
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:38,679
Of course.

180
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:43,518
And you say
she had to come through here?

181
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:47,853
After lights out,
the orderlies play cards in here.

182
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:51,257
Last night, there were seven men
sitting at the base of those stairs

183
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:52,795
playing stud poker.

184
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:55,923
Yet somehow,
Rachel managed to slip past them.

185
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:57,656
Why?

186
00:14:57,768 --> 00:15:00,328
How? She turns invisible?

187
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:03,331
Doctor, we're gonna need access
to the personnel files

188
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:04,430
of all the medical staff.

189
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:07,340
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies,
anyone who was working then.

190
00:15:07,445 --> 00:15:10,209
We'll take your request
under consideration.

191
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:12,874
This is not a request, Doctor.

192
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:15,485
This is a federal facility,
and a dangerous prisoner...

193
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:17,781
-Patient.
-...patient

194
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:20,152
has escaped. Now, you will comply or...

195
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:22,589
All l can say is l'll see what l can do.

196
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:25,526
Doctor, we're gonna need
to speak with the staff.

197
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,620
Do you understand?

198
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:29,926
l'll assemble them in the common room
after dinner.

199
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:32,296
<i>lf you have any further questions,</i>

200
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:35,668
<i>feel free to join the deputy warden</i>
<i>in the search.</i>

201
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:51,451
lt's 1 1 miles to the nearest land
and the water's freezing.

202
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:54,581
Current was strong last night,
tide pushing in.

203
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,250
She'd have drowned
or been crushed on the rocks,

204
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,488
and her body would have
washed back up on shore.

205
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:05,697
What about those caves down there?
Have you checked them?

206
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:08,169
No way she could get there.

207
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:11,036
The bases of those cliffs
are covered in poison ivy,

208
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:15,169
live oak, sumac, a thousand plants
with thorns as big as my dick.

209
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:19,141
You said yourself, Marshal,
she's got no shoes.

210
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:27,117
All right, let's check the other side.

211
00:16:32,563 --> 00:16:35,498
-What's that tower?
-lt's an old lighthouse.

212
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,930
The guards already searched inside it.

213
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:43,066
What's in there? More patients?

214
00:16:43,174 --> 00:16:45,267
Sewage treatment facility.

215
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:49,678
lt's getting dark soon.
l'm calling this off for tonight.

216
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,270
Let's go, boys!

217
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:57,084
<i>You were on watch on the landing, huh?</i>

218
00:16:57,188 --> 00:17:00,589
Yeah. Couldn't nobody get in or out
of their room on that corridor

219
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:02,420
without me seeing.

220
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:07,225
Okay, Rachel Solando, who else does
she have to pass to get down here?

221
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,098
Me. Glen Miga.

222
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:18,932
Sir, l didn't see nothing.

223
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,367
And you were at your post all night?

224
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:23,776
Yeah, but l didn't see a thing.

225
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:26,976
Glen.

226
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:29,812
Glen.

227
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,419
Tell me the truth.

228
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:36,821
l...

229
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:41,126
l maybe went to the bathroom.

230
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:44,327
What? You breached protocol. Christ...

231
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:46,733
l wasn't gone more than a minute.

232
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:49,806
All right, look. Let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

233
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:53,308
Miss Solando was put in her room
for lights out.

234
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,846
Does anyone here know
what she did before that?

235
00:17:56,947 --> 00:17:58,107
Anyone?

236
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:02,050
Come on, anyone,
anyone, anyone, anyone.

237
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:04,620
She was in a group therapy session.

238
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:07,988
Anything unusual occur?

239
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:10,287
Define ''unusual.''

240
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:11,817
Excuse me?

241
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:16,298
This is a mental institution, Marshal,
for the criminally insane.

242
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,891
Usual isn't a big part of our day.

243
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:21,996
l will rephrase.

244
00:18:22,106 --> 00:18:26,042
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy that was more,

245
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:28,611
let's say, l don't know,
memorable than...

246
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:30,441
-Normal?
-Exactly.

247
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:32,876
No. Sorry.

248
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:36,549
Did Miss Solando say anything
during group therapy?

249
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:39,718
She was worried about the rain.

250
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:44,285
And she hated the food here.
Complained constantly,

251
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:46,124
last night included.

252
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:50,591
So you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

253
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:54,029
Yes, Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

254
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:56,505
Dr. Sheehan?

255
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:59,539
Yes, he was running the session.

256
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:05,380
He's Rachel's primary, the psychiatrist
who directly oversees her care.

257
00:19:07,718 --> 00:19:09,913
We're gonna need
to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

258
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,480
l'm afraid that won't be possible.
He left on the ferry this morning.

259
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:17,890
His vacation was already planned.
He'd been putting it off too long.

260
00:19:17,995 --> 00:19:22,728
You're in a state of lockdown,
a dangerous patient has escaped,

261
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:26,963
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

262
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,237
Well, of course. He's a doctor.

263
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:37,408
Do you have the phone number
for where he's gone?

264
00:19:37,948 --> 00:19:39,779
Hello? Hello?

265
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:43,280
Hello?

266
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:45,645
Anybody there?

267
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:48,382
l'm sorry, sir, but it's all down.
All the lines.

268
00:19:48,492 --> 00:19:50,357
The storm's hitting the mainland
like a hammer.

269
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:52,395
lf you get it working,
come find me immediately.

270
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:54,930
The marshals need to make
an important call.

271
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:56,329
Yes, sir.

272
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,405
Hello? Hello?

273
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:04,565
l'm afraid l have evening rounds
in the wards,

274
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:08,406
but l'll be having drinks and a cigar
at my house around 9:00,

275
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:10,503
if you'd care to drop by.

276
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:12,878
Good. We can talk then, right?

277
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:17,316
We have been talking, Marshal.

278
00:20:33,937 --> 00:20:37,100
Gotta say, l'm thinking
l got in the wrong line of public service.

279
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:40,643
lt is a little overwhelming.
lt was constructed during the Civil War,

280
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:43,975
the same time as the military fort
housing Ward C.

281
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:53,349
This is the original
commander's quarters.

282
00:20:53,457 --> 00:20:56,984
When Uncle Sam got the bill,
the commander was court-martialed.

283
00:20:57,094 --> 00:20:59,119
l can see why.

284
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:01,720
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

285
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:03,691
No.

286
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:15,235
-lt's Mahler.
-Quite right, Marshal.

287
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:19,979
Forgive me, gentlemen.
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

288
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,557
<i>Quartet for Piano and Strings</i>
<i>in A minor.</i>

289
00:21:35,165 --> 00:21:36,723
Your poison, gentlemen?

290
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:39,769
-Rye, if you got it.
-Soda and ice, please. Thanks.

291
00:21:40,804 --> 00:21:44,433
You don't indulge in alcohol?
l'm surprised.

292
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:49,476
lsn't it common for men
in your profession to imbibe?

293
00:21:50,013 --> 00:21:52,811
Common enough. And yours?

294
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:55,611
l'm sorry?

295
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:58,552
-Your profession, Doctor. Psychiatry.
-Yes.

296
00:21:58,655 --> 00:22:02,091
l always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks.

297
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,991
Not that l've noticed.

298
00:22:06,096 --> 00:22:08,155
What's that?
lced tea in your glass, there?

299
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,861
Excellent, Marshal.

300
00:22:11,368 --> 00:22:14,098
You have outstanding
defense mechanisms.

301
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:18,539
You must be quite adept
at interrogations, hmm?

302
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:30,009
Men like you are my specialty,
you know?

303
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:32,382
Men of violence.

304
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:34,354
Now that's a hell of an assumption
to make.

305
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,085
No assumption. No, not at all.

306
00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:40,186
You misunderstand me.
l said you are men of violence.

307
00:22:40,297 --> 00:22:43,425
l'm not accusing you
of being violent men.

308
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:44,501
That's quite different.

309
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:47,399
No, please. Please. Edify us, Doctor.

310
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:52,107
You both served overseas, huh?

311
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:53,403
lt's not much of a stretch, Doc.

312
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,002
For all you know,
we were both paper pushers over there.

313
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:58,547
No, you were not.

314
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:15,654
Since the schoolyard,

315
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:19,759
neither of you has ever walked away
from a physical conflict.

316
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,031
No, no, not because you enjoy it,

317
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:25,973
but because retreat isn't something
you consider an option.

318
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:27,970
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

319
00:23:28,912 --> 00:23:31,210
Yes. ''Raised.''

320
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,514
And who raised you, Marshal?

321
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:37,213
Me?

322
00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:39,716
Wolves.

323
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,553
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

324
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:46,722
<i>Do you believe in God, Marshal?</i>

325
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,861
No, l'm quite serious.

326
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:03,431
You ever seen a death camp, Doctor?

327
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:20,857
His English really is very good.

328
00:25:20,957 --> 00:25:23,755
You hit the consonants
a tad hard, though.

329
00:25:24,895 --> 00:25:26,522
You're a German?

330
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:29,729
ls legal immigration a crime, Marshal?

331
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:32,233
l don't know, Doctor. You tell us.

332
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:35,766
Now, listen.

333
00:25:35,872 --> 00:25:37,737
We're gonna need those files
on Sheehan

334
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:39,638
and the rest of the staff as well.

335
00:25:39,743 --> 00:25:42,837
No personnel files will
be released to you. Period.

336
00:25:42,946 --> 00:25:46,006
-We're gonna need those files.
-Out of the question.

337
00:25:46,116 --> 00:25:47,606
Bullshit, out of the question!

338
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:48,776
Bullshit!

339
00:25:48,885 --> 00:25:51,649
Just who the hell's in charge here,
anyway, huh?

340
00:25:51,755 --> 00:25:55,247
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison
to our Board of Overseers.

341
00:25:55,358 --> 00:25:57,519
He relayed your request,
and it's been refused.

342
00:25:57,627 --> 00:26:00,926
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse, and neither do you, sir.

343
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:04,728
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we'll do all we can to help.

344
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:06,393
This investigation is over.

345
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:08,801
We're gonna file our reports
and we're gonna hand it over to...

346
00:26:08,905 --> 00:26:11,373
-Hoover's boys.
-Hoover's boys. That's right.

347
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:15,172
We'll be taking the ferry back
in the morning. Come on, Chuck.

348
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,219
Nice night.

349
00:26:31,194 --> 00:26:34,186
You'll be bunking
in the orderlies' quarters.

350
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:47,339
Hey, boss.

351
00:26:47,944 --> 00:26:50,071
We really packing it in?

352
00:26:50,714 --> 00:26:51,840
Why?

353
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:56,681
l guess... l don't know,
l just never really quit anything before.

354
00:26:57,154 --> 00:26:59,952
We haven't heard the truth
once yet, Chuck.

355
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,285
Listen, Rachel Solando didn't slip out
of a locked cell, barefoot,

356
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:05,588
without any help.

357
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:09,288
l think she had a lot of help.

358
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,959
Maybe Cawley's sitting up
in his mansion right now

359
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:14,332
rethinking his whole attitude.

360
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:18,874
-Maybe, in the morning, we'll be...
-You're bluffing?

361
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:21,138
l didn't say that.

362
00:27:39,596 --> 00:27:42,190
l found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

363
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:45,333
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

364
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:49,097
l killed a lot of people in the war.

365
00:27:50,907 --> 00:27:52,738
ls that why you drink?

366
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:57,079
Are you real?

367
00:27:58,281 --> 00:27:59,270
No.

368
00:28:03,353 --> 00:28:04,980
She's still here.

369
00:28:05,689 --> 00:28:06,951
Who?

370
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:09,319
Rachel?

371
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,184
She never left.

372
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:29,706
Remember when we stayed
in the cabin in the summer, Teddy?

373
00:28:30,513 --> 00:28:32,208
We were so happy.

374
00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:36,051
She's here.

375
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,077
You can't leave.

376
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:52,764
l'm not gonna leave.

377
00:28:54,137 --> 00:28:56,037
l love you so much.

378
00:29:00,443 --> 00:29:02,934
l'm just bones in a box, Teddy.

379
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:04,070
No.

380
00:29:05,782 --> 00:29:07,044
l am.

381
00:29:09,953 --> 00:29:11,818
You have to wake up.

382
00:29:13,757 --> 00:29:15,224
l won't go.

383
00:29:16,326 --> 00:29:17,793
You're here.

384
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:23,597
l'm not. You have to face that.

385
00:29:26,836 --> 00:29:28,269
But she is.

386
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:31,872
So is he.

387
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,170
Who?

388
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:39,012
Laeddis.

389
00:29:43,586 --> 00:29:45,645
-l have to go.
-No.

390
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:50,391
No, please. Please.
l need to hold on to you.

391
00:29:51,127 --> 00:29:53,755
-Just a little bit longer, please.
-Oh, God, Teddy.

392
00:29:53,863 --> 00:29:55,831
You have to let me go.

393
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,631
l can't.

394
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:32,726
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

395
00:30:37,674 --> 00:30:38,971
Doctor!

396
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:41,172
Doctor, Doctor.

397
00:30:41,277 --> 00:30:44,269
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

398
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:46,281
l thought your investigation was finished.

399
00:30:46,383 --> 00:30:49,318
Well, it's not like
we could take the ferry.

400
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:53,412
Now, was Rachel receiving
any other treatments for her illnesses?

401
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:57,552
Do you know the state of the mental
health field these days, gentlemen?

402
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,821
No, not a clue, Doctor.

403
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:01,260
War.

404
00:31:01,364 --> 00:31:04,094
The old school believes
in surgical intervention.

405
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,667
Psychosurgery.

406
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:08,704
Procedures like
the transorbital lobotomy.

407
00:31:09,873 --> 00:31:13,138
Some say the patients
become reasonable, docile.

408
00:31:13,243 --> 00:31:15,507
Others say they become zombies.

409
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:17,773
-And the new school?
-Psychopharmacology.

410
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:20,076
A new drug has just been approved
called Thorazine,

411
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:23,346
which relaxes psychotic patients,
you could say tames them.

412
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:24,750
And which school are you, Doctor?

413
00:31:24,854 --> 00:31:29,382
Me? l have this radical idea that
if you treat a patient with respect,

414
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:33,588
listen to him, try and understand,
you just might reach him.

415
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:39,501
Come on, Marge. lt's okay.

416
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:42,498
-These patients, huh?
-Even these.

417
00:31:42,605 --> 00:31:45,005
What should be a last resort
is becoming a first response.

418
00:31:45,108 --> 00:31:48,942
Give them a pill, put them in a corner,
it all goes away.

419
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:51,275
Rachel Solando was on
a combination of drugs

420
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:53,315
meant to keep her
from becoming violent,

421
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:56,442
but it was only intermittently effective.

422
00:31:56,553 --> 00:31:58,180
The greatest obstacle to her recovery

423
00:31:58,288 --> 00:32:01,189
was her refusal
to face what she had done.

424
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:03,219
''Was.''

425
00:32:03,793 --> 00:32:08,628
ls there a reason you keep referring to
your patient in the past tense, Doctor?

426
00:32:11,301 --> 00:32:14,759
Look outside, Marshal.
Why do you think?

427
00:32:21,744 --> 00:32:23,302
Next up is Peter Breene.

428
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:25,745
Assaulted his father's nurse
with broken glass.

429
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:29,376
Nurse survived,
but her face is permanently disfigured.

430
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:30,919
l can't wait.

431
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:37,152
She'd smile at me. She was so sweet,
but you could see it in her eyes.

432
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,627
She liked to be naked, to suck cock.

433
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:43,726
Okay, Mr. Breene.

434
00:32:44,534 --> 00:32:47,765
And then she asked me
if she can have a glass of water?

435
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:50,999
Alone, in the kitchen,
like that's no big deal?

436
00:32:52,008 --> 00:32:55,068
-Well, why was that a big deal?
-lt was obvious.

437
00:32:55,178 --> 00:32:59,342
She wanted me to pull out my thing
so that she could laugh at it.

438
00:33:01,484 --> 00:33:02,917
Mr. Breene.

439
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:07,051
We need to ask you
some questions, okay?

440
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:11,489
When l cut her, she screamed.

441
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:16,125
But she scared me.

442
00:33:17,267 --> 00:33:20,430
-What did she expect?
-lnteresting.

443
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:25,066
But we're here
to talk about Rachel Solando, okay?

444
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:27,166
Rachel Solando. Do you...

445
00:33:27,277 --> 00:33:29,507
Do you know that
she drowned her own kids?

446
00:33:29,612 --> 00:33:31,739
She drowned her kids!

447
00:33:31,848 --> 00:33:34,874
This is... This is a sick fucking world
we live in, l'll tell you that.

448
00:33:34,984 --> 00:33:36,679
But you know what?
They should be gassed.

449
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:41,052
All of them.
The retards, the killers, the niggers.

450
00:33:41,157 --> 00:33:43,751
You kill your own kid, gas the bitch.

451
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,927
Could you stop that?

452
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:52,899
-That nurse...
-Please, stop that.

453
00:33:53,002 --> 00:33:56,028
That nurse, maybe she had kids, huh?

454
00:33:58,007 --> 00:33:59,372
A husband.

455
00:34:00,543 --> 00:34:02,841
Just trying to make ends meet,

456
00:34:04,247 --> 00:34:06,511
lead a normal life.

457
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,745
lt says in your file that

458
00:34:10,753 --> 00:34:13,278
you tore her face off. Didn't you?

459
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:15,791
Congratulations.

460
00:34:15,892 --> 00:34:18,759
No more normal for her,
not ever again. No.

461
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,224
Do you know what she was afraid of?

462
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:27,058
You.

463
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,400
Could you stop that? Please?

464
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:32,772
Stop that!

465
00:34:33,676 --> 00:34:35,109
Please! Stop!

466
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:37,338
Do you know a patient
named Andrew Laeddis? Do you?

467
00:34:37,447 --> 00:34:38,641
No! No.

468
00:34:38,748 --> 00:34:40,773
-Boss. What's up?
-Fine.

469
00:34:40,883 --> 00:34:42,851
-l wanna go back. l wanna go.
-Peter!

470
00:34:42,952 --> 00:34:46,547
Come on! l got him. Peter! Peter!
Hey, Peter!

471
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,953
Go back.

472
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:49,425
-l wanna go back.
-Come on, Peter.

473
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:50,651
-l don't wanna see him.
-Easy now.

474
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,490
-l don't wanna see him anymore.
-lt's okay. lt's all right.

475
00:34:59,669 --> 00:35:03,332
Oh, l'll never get out of here.
l'm not sure that l should.

476
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:07,709
Excuse me for saying this,
Miss Kearns...

477
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,506
-Mrs.
-Mrs. Kearns.

478
00:35:12,215 --> 00:35:15,116
But you seem quite normal.

479
00:35:15,218 --> 00:35:18,415
l mean, in comparison
to the other patients here.

480
00:35:18,521 --> 00:35:22,116
Well, l have my dark days.
l suppose everybody does.

481
00:35:23,259 --> 00:35:26,863
The difference is most people
don't kill their husbands with an ax.

482
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:27,522
The difference is most people
don't kill their husbands with an ax.

483
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:31,661
Although, personally,
l think if a man beats you

484
00:35:31,768 --> 00:35:36,569
and fucks half the women he sees,
and no one will help you,

485
00:35:37,307 --> 00:35:41,073
axing him isn't the least
understandable thing you could do.

486
00:35:42,412 --> 00:35:44,004
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

487
00:35:45,648 --> 00:35:50,017
What would l do if l did?
l don't know the world anymore.

488
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:54,783
They say there are bombs
that can reduce whole cities to ash.

489
00:35:54,891 --> 00:36:00,193
And what do you call them, televisions,
voices and faces coming from a box.

490
00:36:01,197 --> 00:36:03,461
l hear enough voices already.

491
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:06,561
What can you tell us about Rachel?

492
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:12,668
Not much. She keeps to herself.

493
00:36:12,775 --> 00:36:16,176
She believed her kids were alive.

494
00:36:17,013 --> 00:36:19,311
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires,

495
00:36:19,415 --> 00:36:24,352
and we were all her neighbors,
the milkmen, postmen...

496
00:36:24,454 --> 00:36:25,978
Deliverymen.

497
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:29,617
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

498
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:33,253
Yes. He talked about anger.

499
00:36:36,132 --> 00:36:39,226
Tell me about him. What's he like?

500
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,468
He's okay. Nice.

501
00:36:48,478 --> 00:36:51,470
Not hard on the eyes,
as my mother would say.

502
00:36:53,883 --> 00:36:57,182
-Did he ever make a pass at you?
-No.

503
00:36:58,388 --> 00:37:01,653
No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor,
he would never...

504
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:07,325
Could l have a glass of water, please?

505
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,829
No problem.

506
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,011
-Thank you, Marshal.
-Sure.

507
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:33,085
l just have one more question for you,
Mrs. Kearns.

508
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:39,623
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

509
00:37:42,765 --> 00:37:43,891
No.

510
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:47,098
Never heard of him.

511
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:54,001
<i>She was coached.</i>

512
00:37:54,644 --> 00:37:57,204
She used practically the same words
as Cawley and the nurse,

513
00:37:57,313 --> 00:37:58,780
like she'd been told exactly what to say.

514
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:00,712
Who's Andrew Laeddis?

515
00:38:05,321 --> 00:38:09,621
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

516
00:38:13,496 --> 00:38:16,932
What the hell, boss?
l'm your partner, for Christ's sake.

517
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:18,864
We just met, Chuck.

518
00:38:19,335 --> 00:38:22,896
You've been on the beat for a long time.
You've got a duty. You've got a career.

519
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:27,374
What l'm doing,
it's not exactly by the book.

520
00:38:28,845 --> 00:38:31,609
l don't give a damn
about by-the-book, boss.

521
00:38:31,714 --> 00:38:34,581
l just wanna know
what the hell's going on.

522
00:38:38,855 --> 00:38:41,449
When this case came over the wires,

523
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:45,327
l requested it specifically,
you understand?

524
00:38:45,795 --> 00:38:46,955
Why?

525
00:38:49,232 --> 00:38:50,927
Andrew Laeddis,

526
00:38:51,801 --> 00:38:53,928
he was the maintenance man
in the apartment building

527
00:38:54,036 --> 00:38:56,163
where my wife and l lived.

528
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,468
Okay.

529
00:39:00,343 --> 00:39:02,334
He was also a firebug.

530
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:07,741
Andrew Laeddis lit the match

531
00:39:10,553 --> 00:39:13,420
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

532
00:39:21,697 --> 00:39:23,130
Let them out!

533
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:29,134
-What happened to Laeddis?
-He got away with it.

534
00:39:29,238 --> 00:39:31,638
Laeddis got away with it
and then he disappeared.

535
00:39:31,741 --> 00:39:34,733
About a year ago, l open up the paper
and there he is.

536
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:39,304
Ugly-looking son of a bitch. Huge scar
from his right temple down to his left lip.

537
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:42,851
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you'd forget.

538
00:39:42,952 --> 00:39:46,046
He burned down a schoolhouse,
killed two people,

539
00:39:46,155 --> 00:39:47,884
said voices told him to do it.

540
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,618
First he went to prison,
then he got transferred here.

541
00:39:50,726 --> 00:39:52,921
-Then what?
-Then nothing.

542
00:39:53,029 --> 00:39:56,760
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

543
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:59,198
Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.
That leaves Ward C.

544
00:39:59,302 --> 00:40:00,564
Or he could be dead.

545
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,264
So could Rachel Solando,
for that matter.

546
00:40:03,372 --> 00:40:05,897
Lot of places to hide a body here.

547
00:40:06,742 --> 00:40:09,609
Only one place
no one would really notice.

548
00:40:21,223 --> 00:40:25,250
That patient, Bridget Kearns,
when she sent me for water,

549
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:28,262
she said something to you back there,
didn't she?

550
00:40:28,364 --> 00:40:29,456
No.

551
00:40:31,434 --> 00:40:32,696
Come on, boss.

552
00:40:36,606 --> 00:40:38,096
She wrote it.

553
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:54,715
Boss!

554
00:40:55,057 --> 00:40:58,652
We gotta get indoors. lt's turning
into a fucking Kansas out here.

555
00:40:58,761 --> 00:41:00,956
-Hold on.
-No, let's go!

556
00:41:03,866 --> 00:41:05,299
Watch out!

557
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:08,631
Jesus!

558
00:41:10,406 --> 00:41:12,670
-Come on! Up there!
-Let's go!

559
00:41:15,378 --> 00:41:17,312
Get in there! Let's go!

560
00:41:20,983 --> 00:41:22,143
Boss!

561
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,282
-God!
-Jesus Christ!

562
00:41:32,662 --> 00:41:34,596
Damn it. God!

563
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:46,536
-You okay, boss?
-Yeah, l'm all right.

564
00:41:53,582 --> 00:41:57,814
So if Laeddis is here,
what are you gonna do about it?

565
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,154
l'm not here to kill Laeddis.

566
00:42:10,866 --> 00:42:12,595
lf it was my wife, l'd kill him.

567
00:42:12,702 --> 00:42:13,669
Twice.

568
00:42:24,447 --> 00:42:29,043
<i>When we got through the gates</i>
<i>at Dachau, the SS guards surrendered.</i>

569
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:43,325
The <i>Kommandant</i> tried to kill himself
before we got there, but he...

570
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,762
<i>He botched it.</i>

571
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:49,303
Took him an hour to die.

572
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:58,139
When l went outside,
l saw all the bodies on the ground.

573
00:43:02,651 --> 00:43:04,312
<i>Too many to count.</i>

574
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,877
Too many to imagine.

575
00:43:35,518 --> 00:43:37,179
So, yeah, the...

576
00:43:39,421 --> 00:43:41,321
The guards surrendered,
we took their guns,

577
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:43,288
<i>and we lined them up.</i>

578
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:29,629
lt wasn't warfare. lt was...

579
00:44:31,707 --> 00:44:33,174
lt was murder.

580
00:44:36,712 --> 00:44:39,613
Yeah, l've had enough of killing.

581
00:44:42,117 --> 00:44:44,085
That's not why l'm here.

582
00:44:45,187 --> 00:44:47,178
So what is this all about?

583
00:44:49,258 --> 00:44:55,128
After Laeddis vanished, l started doing
some checking on Ashecliffe.

584
00:44:56,665 --> 00:44:59,691
A lot of people know about this place,
but no one wants to talk.

585
00:44:59,802 --> 00:45:03,738
You know, it's like it...
lt's like they're scared or something.

586
00:45:05,808 --> 00:45:08,868
You know, this place is funded
by a special grant

587
00:45:09,812 --> 00:45:12,645
from The House
Un-American Activities Committee?

588
00:45:12,748 --> 00:45:15,876
HUAC? And how exactly
are we fighting the communists

589
00:45:15,985 --> 00:45:18,317
from an island in Boston Harbor?

590
00:45:18,954 --> 00:45:21,548
By conducting experiments on the mind.

591
00:45:22,992 --> 00:45:24,459
At least that's my guess.

592
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,255
And you think that's going on here?

593
00:45:26,362 --> 00:45:28,830
Like l said, no one would talk, right?

594
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:31,593
Till l found somebody
who used to be a patient here.

595
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:36,034
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid. Socialist.

596
00:45:36,138 --> 00:45:38,163
He gets offered some money
to do a psych study.

597
00:45:38,274 --> 00:45:39,639
Guess what they were testing?

598
00:45:39,742 --> 00:45:40,800
Toothpaste.

599
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:43,276
So, he starts
seeing dragons everywhere.

600
00:45:43,379 --> 00:45:48,339
He almost beats his professor to death.
Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C.

601
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:52,487
They release him after one year, right?
And what does he do?

602
00:45:52,588 --> 00:45:57,457
Two weeks on the mainland, he walks
into a bar, stabs three men to death.

603
00:45:58,294 --> 00:46:02,993
His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce,
he stands up in the courtroom and he...

604
00:46:03,098 --> 00:46:07,535
He begs the judge for the electric chair.
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

605
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,730
Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.

606
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:12,831
And you found him.

607
00:46:12,942 --> 00:46:14,569
Yeah, l found him.

608
00:46:14,677 --> 00:46:17,145
Well, he's a mess.

609
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:20,874
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

610
00:46:20,983 --> 00:46:22,075
What?

611
00:46:22,184 --> 00:46:24,914
They're experimenting on people here.

612
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,681
l don't know, boss.

613
00:46:28,023 --> 00:46:29,513
How do you believe a crazy guy?

614
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,252
That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

615
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,592
Crazy people, they're the perfect
subjects. They talk, nobody listens.

616
00:46:36,198 --> 00:46:37,825
l stood at Dachau.

617
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:42,763
We saw what human beings are
capable of doing to each other, right?

618
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:45,431
For Christ's sakes, we fought
a goddamn war to stop them,

619
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:49,272
and now... Now l find out it may be
happening here? On our soil?

620
00:46:49,378 --> 00:46:50,367
No.

621
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,174
So what are you really here to do, Ted?

622
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:58,716
l'm gonna get the proof,
l'm gonna go back,

623
00:46:58,821 --> 00:47:02,450
and l'm gonna blow the lid off this place.
That's it.

624
00:47:03,892 --> 00:47:05,359
Wait a minute.

625
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:08,759
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

626
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:10,263
waiting for a chance to get out here,

627
00:47:10,366 --> 00:47:12,926
and then suddenly
they need a U.S. Marshal?

628
00:47:13,035 --> 00:47:16,903
Yeah, l got lucky. There was a patient
escape. lt was the perfect excuse.

629
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:19,975
No, no, no, boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

630
00:47:20,075 --> 00:47:21,736
The world doesn't work that way.

631
00:47:21,844 --> 00:47:25,109
They got an electrified fence
around a septic facility.

632
00:47:25,214 --> 00:47:28,308
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

633
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:32,080
A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

634
00:47:32,187 --> 00:47:36,749
l mean, Jesus Christ, everything about
this place stinks of government ops.

635
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:38,190
What if they wanted you here?

636
00:47:38,293 --> 00:47:40,158
-Bullshit.
-You were asking questions.

637
00:47:40,262 --> 00:47:41,286
-Bullshit! Bullshit!
-Bullshit.

638
00:47:41,397 --> 00:47:42,625
We came here for Rachel Solando.

639
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:45,598
Where's one shred of evidence
she even existed?

640
00:47:45,701 --> 00:47:46,827
There's no way they could've known

641
00:47:46,935 --> 00:47:48,300
l'd be assigned to this case.
There's no way.

642
00:47:48,404 --> 00:47:51,737
What if while you were looking into
them, they were looking into you?

643
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,003
All they had to do was fake an escape
to get you here, and now they have you.

644
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,873
Now they have us both. Here! Now!

645
00:48:01,183 --> 00:48:05,449
<i>Marshals, are you out here?</i>
<i>This is Deputy Warden McPherson.</i>

646
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:07,646
<i>Marshals!</i>

647
00:48:07,756 --> 00:48:09,724
How about that? They found us, huh?

648
00:48:09,825 --> 00:48:12,293
lt's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

649
00:48:13,729 --> 00:48:15,287
<i>l know you're in there.</i>

650
00:48:16,932 --> 00:48:20,390
We're getting off this goddamn island.
You and me. Come on.

651
00:48:24,807 --> 00:48:26,468
-Come on!
-Go, go!

652
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:39,412
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now.

653
00:48:40,089 --> 00:48:43,581
And hurry up! This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

654
00:48:48,797 --> 00:48:52,699
l dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
Should be ready by tomorrow.

655
00:48:53,202 --> 00:48:56,000
That is, if we all don't wash away first.

656
00:48:56,105 --> 00:49:00,542
You know, speaking of which, l'm afraid
your smokes are pretty much done for.

657
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:02,269
So...

658
00:49:03,979 --> 00:49:06,072
This is our only choice, huh?

659
00:49:06,181 --> 00:49:09,207
Got something really nice in
a prison gray if that don't work for you.

660
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:12,185
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

661
00:49:12,955 --> 00:49:14,547
That's why l must repeat my insistence

662
00:49:14,656 --> 00:49:17,750
that all Ward C patients
be placed in manual restraints.

663
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,759
lf the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

664
00:49:22,264 --> 00:49:23,458
That would take a lot of flooding.

665
00:49:23,565 --> 00:49:26,227
We're on an island in the middle
of the ocean during a hurricane.

666
00:49:26,335 --> 00:49:28,963
A lot of flooding seems like
a distinct possibility.

667
00:49:29,071 --> 00:49:31,403
lt's a gamble, Stephen.
Say the power fails.

668
00:49:31,507 --> 00:49:32,735
There's a backup generator.

669
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:35,503
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

670
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:38,740
Where are they going to go?

671
00:49:39,414 --> 00:49:42,406
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

672
00:49:42,518 --> 00:49:43,507
Oh, you're quite right.

673
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:46,713
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

674
00:49:47,689 --> 00:49:50,590
lf they're manacled to the floor,
they'll die.

675
00:49:50,926 --> 00:49:52,791
This is 24 human beings.

676
00:49:53,428 --> 00:49:54,725
And you can live with that, can you?

677
00:49:54,963 --> 00:49:56,931
Well, frankly, if it were up to me,

678
00:49:57,032 --> 00:50:00,365
l'd put all 42 in Wards A and B
in manual restraints as well.

679
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:03,302
-Excuse me! Excuse me.
-Marshal.

680
00:50:03,405 --> 00:50:05,930
l'm sorry, Doctor.
l just have one quick question.

681
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:07,235
Yes, l'll be with you in a moment.

682
00:50:07,342 --> 00:50:10,311
When we spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note...

683
00:50:10,412 --> 00:50:12,107
''The law of four.'' l love that.

684
00:50:12,214 --> 00:50:15,706
...you said you had no idea what that
second line could refer to, correct?

685
00:50:16,919 --> 00:50:21,219
''Who is 67?'' Yes, l'm afraid l still don't.
None of us do.

686
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:23,885
Nothing comes to mind?

687
00:50:26,628 --> 00:50:27,822
Nothing?

688
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:36,827
Because l believe l just heard you say
there are 24 patients in Ward C

689
00:50:36,939 --> 00:50:39,407
and 42 patients in Wards A and B,

690
00:50:39,508 --> 00:50:42,909
which means there's a total of,
what, 66 patients at this facility?

691
00:50:44,613 --> 00:50:45,580
That is correct, yes.

692
00:50:49,084 --> 00:50:52,144
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando was suggesting

693
00:50:52,254 --> 00:50:55,348
that you have a 67th patient, Doctor.

694
00:50:56,959 --> 00:50:58,426
But l'm afraid we don't.

695
00:50:58,994 --> 00:51:00,928
This is ridiculous.
What are they doing here?

696
00:51:01,029 --> 00:51:03,122
We're doing our goddamn job.

697
00:51:03,532 --> 00:51:06,160
Didn't McPherson tell you
the good news?

698
00:51:07,336 --> 00:51:09,770
No. What's the good news, Doctor?

699
00:51:09,871 --> 00:51:11,566
Rachel's been found.

700
00:51:12,641 --> 00:51:13,972
She's here.

701
00:51:15,177 --> 00:51:16,644
Safe and sound.

702
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,381
There's not a mark on her.

703
00:51:34,062 --> 00:51:35,427
Who are these men?

704
00:51:38,834 --> 00:51:40,392
Why are they in my house?

705
00:51:40,502 --> 00:51:44,962
Police officers, Rachel.
They have a few questions.

706
00:51:48,543 --> 00:51:49,669
Ma'am.

707
00:51:53,115 --> 00:51:57,677
There has been a sighting of a known
communist subversive in this area,

708
00:51:57,786 --> 00:51:59,651
passing out literature.

709
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,650
Here?

710
00:52:04,926 --> 00:52:06,518
ln this neighborhood?

711
00:52:06,628 --> 00:52:08,323
Yes, l'm afraid so.

712
00:52:09,731 --> 00:52:13,292
Now if you could tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

713
00:52:13,402 --> 00:52:15,495
it would really help us
narrow down our search.

714
00:52:17,205 --> 00:52:18,365
Yes...

715
00:52:21,176 --> 00:52:22,473
Well, l...

716
00:52:25,414 --> 00:52:28,212
l made breakfast
for Jim and the children,

717
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:31,316
and then l

718
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:35,382
packed Jim's lunch and he left.

719
00:52:39,127 --> 00:52:41,755
Then l sent the children off to school.

720
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:47,429
And then

721
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:56,867
l decided to take a long swim
in the lake.

722
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:04,979
l see.

723
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:10,214
And after that?

724
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:19,730
After that,

725
00:53:29,578 --> 00:53:31,170
l thought of you.

726
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:41,155
l'm sorry, ma'am,
l don't know what you're talking about.

727
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:47,094
Don't you know how lonely
l've been, Jim?

728
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:54,125
You're gone.

729
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,873
You're dead.

730
00:54:04,946 --> 00:54:06,777
l cry every night.

731
00:54:12,821 --> 00:54:14,982
How am l supposed to survive?

732
00:54:16,525 --> 00:54:17,651
God.

733
00:54:28,103 --> 00:54:31,334
Rachel, it'll be all right.

734
00:54:34,643 --> 00:54:36,634
l'm so sorry, but every...

735
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,178
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay?

736
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:44,584
l buried you.

737
00:54:46,955 --> 00:54:49,549
l buried an empty casket.
Your body rained down,

738
00:54:49,658 --> 00:54:53,116
lumps of flesh splashing into the sea,
eaten by sharks.

739
00:54:57,399 --> 00:54:59,993
My Jim's dead,
so who the fuck are you?

740
00:55:03,472 --> 00:55:05,099
Who the fuck are you?

741
00:55:05,874 --> 00:55:06,966
-Who are you?
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

742
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:08,667
-Who are you?
-lt's okay. Rachel. Rachel, it's all right.

743
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:11,211
Let me go! No!

744
00:55:12,948 --> 00:55:15,007
-Rachel, it's okay.
-Look at me, look at me.

745
00:55:18,353 --> 00:55:21,254
l'm sorry about that.
l didn't want to interrupt.

746
00:55:21,356 --> 00:55:23,654
l thought she might tell you something.

747
00:55:23,758 --> 00:55:27,694
We found her down by the lighthouse,
skipping stones.

748
00:55:27,796 --> 00:55:29,923
We've no idea how she got out, but...

749
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:32,397
l'm gonna have to ask you
to go down into the basement.

750
00:55:32,501 --> 00:55:34,435
There's food, water and cots.

751
00:55:34,536 --> 00:55:37,767
lt's the safest place to be
when the hurricane hits.

752
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:44,272
Are you all right? You look pale.

753
00:55:44,379 --> 00:55:46,142
l'm fine. lt's just...

754
00:55:47,616 --> 00:55:49,174
Boss, are you okay?

755
00:55:50,218 --> 00:55:52,778
lt's just so goddamn bright, isn't it?

756
00:55:52,888 --> 00:55:55,049
Photosensitivity, headaches sometimes.

757
00:55:55,156 --> 00:55:57,215
Marshal, are you having a migraine?

758
00:55:57,325 --> 00:55:58,952
l'll be all right.

759
00:56:01,062 --> 00:56:03,257
Come on, l got you.

760
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,692
What's wrong with him?

761
00:56:06,801 --> 00:56:09,201
Take these, Marshal. Couple of hours,
you'll be as clear as a bell.

762
00:56:09,304 --> 00:56:11,295
-What's wrong with him?
-He's having a migraine.

763
00:56:11,406 --> 00:56:13,670
lmagine someone sawed open
your head, filled it with razors,

764
00:56:13,775 --> 00:56:16,471
and shook it as hard as they could.
Take the pills, Marshal.

765
00:56:16,578 --> 00:56:18,671
-l don't... l don't want the pills.
-lt'll stop the pain.

766
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,680
Marshal, take the pills.

767
00:56:24,653 --> 00:56:26,621
He's going to need to lie down.

768
00:56:32,327 --> 00:56:33,294
Oh, my God!

769
00:56:33,395 --> 00:56:34,692
Michael, there's broken glass
all over the floor.

770
00:56:34,796 --> 00:56:36,354
-Make sure all the meds are locked up.
-Watch your back.

771
00:56:36,464 --> 00:56:37,453
Make sure everything's okay in Ward B.

772
00:56:37,566 --> 00:56:39,033
Go down to the infirmary
and see if there's any more...

773
00:56:39,134 --> 00:56:40,226
All right, Doctor.

774
00:56:40,335 --> 00:56:44,135
Give him a bed. This one here.

775
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,800
-Over here. All right, boss.
-Yeah, that's it.

776
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:48,967
-You have him?
-Yes.

777
00:56:49,077 --> 00:56:50,271
Careful. All right.

778
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:56,115
Could be worse right now.
He'll be all right.

779
00:57:01,222 --> 00:57:02,621
Who is that?

780
00:57:02,724 --> 00:57:05,158
Him? That's the warden.

781
00:57:07,896 --> 00:57:09,921
Don't you worry about him, all right?

782
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:12,124
Come on. Lay back. Lay back.

783
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:19,672
He looks like an ex-military prick, huh?

784
00:57:19,774 --> 00:57:21,674
Well, you know what?
l ain't gonna argue with you on that one.

785
00:58:48,063 --> 00:58:50,429
You should have saved me.

786
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,732
You should have saved all of us.

787
00:59:23,865 --> 00:59:25,526
Hey, buddy.

788
00:59:27,802 --> 00:59:29,030
Hey.

789
00:59:29,137 --> 00:59:30,399
Laeddis.

790
00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:33,199
Yeah.

791
00:59:38,513 --> 00:59:39,571
My...

792
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:45,177
My buddy.

793
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:48,622
No hard feelings, right?

794
00:59:52,594 --> 00:59:53,618
Yeah.

795
00:59:55,196 --> 00:59:56,823
No hard feelings.

796
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:12,472
A little something for later,

797
01:00:16,017 --> 01:00:18,577
'cause l know how much you need it.

798
01:00:24,826 --> 01:00:28,819
The clock's ticking, my friend.
We're running out of time.

799
01:00:39,707 --> 01:00:41,436
Give me a hand here.

800
01:01:03,731 --> 01:01:05,198
l could get into trouble.

801
01:01:33,661 --> 01:01:34,923
l'm dead.

802
01:01:37,932 --> 01:01:39,456
l'm so sorry.

803
01:01:41,135 --> 01:01:43,103
Why didn't you save me?

804
01:01:44,138 --> 01:01:49,735
l tried. l wanted to, but by the time
l got there, it was too late.

805
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,992
See?

806
01:02:16,337 --> 01:02:18,168
Aren't they beautiful?

807
01:03:12,961 --> 01:03:14,986
Why are you all wet, baby?

808
01:03:17,732 --> 01:03:19,393
Laeddis isn't dead.

809
01:03:20,802 --> 01:03:22,269
He isn't gone.

810
01:03:23,504 --> 01:03:25,062
He's still here.

811
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:28,535
l know.

812
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:33,913
You need to find him, Teddy. You need
to find him and you kill him dead.

813
01:03:51,766 --> 01:03:52,960
lt's okay.

814
01:04:02,944 --> 01:04:05,674
-Security to Ward A. Okay.
-Ward A. l got it.

815
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,771
The generator room's flooded.

816
01:04:07,882 --> 01:04:10,077
-Ward A. Ward A.
-See what we need in Ward B.

817
01:04:10,518 --> 01:04:11,678
Let's go.

818
01:04:12,053 --> 01:04:13,543
You okay, boss?

819
01:04:16,224 --> 01:04:18,215
This goddamn migraine.

820
01:04:18,326 --> 01:04:22,160
The backup generator's failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.

821
01:04:23,931 --> 01:04:25,159
What do you want to do?

822
01:04:31,572 --> 01:04:34,541
-Christ.
-Dan? Relax. Nope, nope, nope.

823
01:04:34,642 --> 01:04:37,076
You don't wanna do that. Put it down.
Now. Put it down.

824
01:04:37,178 --> 01:04:40,705
Grab him, grab him, grab him, grab him!
Get him, get him!

825
01:04:44,752 --> 01:04:47,778
You need to go find him
'cause he needs to be here.

826
01:04:47,889 --> 01:04:50,380
You think the whole electrical system
is fried?

827
01:04:50,491 --> 01:04:53,221
l'd say it's a good possibility, yeah.

828
01:04:53,327 --> 01:04:56,353
-All the electronic security, the fences...
-Why are you always running?

829
01:04:56,464 --> 01:04:59,627
-...the gates, the doors.
-Why is it you every time? Come on.

830
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:03,670
Nice day for a stroll, don't you think?
To Ward C, for example.

831
01:05:06,274 --> 01:05:09,300
-Come on.
-Maybe we'll run into Andrew Laeddis.

832
01:05:14,382 --> 01:05:17,351
The guy l told you about,
George Noyce?

833
01:05:17,452 --> 01:05:20,114
He told me this is where
they keep the worst ones.

834
01:05:20,221 --> 01:05:22,815
Guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

835
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:27,023
Did Noyce give you anything
on the layout?

836
01:05:27,128 --> 01:05:30,859
Not really. All he remembered was
people screaming day and night,

837
01:05:30,965 --> 01:05:33,627
no windows and iron bars everywhere.

838
01:05:33,734 --> 01:05:34,894
Watch your head!

839
01:05:54,922 --> 01:05:56,890
-Oh, Jesus Christ!
-Jesus.

840
01:05:57,525 --> 01:05:59,516
First time on Ward C, huh?

841
01:06:00,595 --> 01:06:02,290
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

842
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:03,420
We heard stories, but...

843
01:06:03,531 --> 01:06:06,125
Trust me, son, you haven't heard shit.

844
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:08,727
We got most of the bugsies
locked down now,

845
01:06:09,103 --> 01:06:11,037
but some of them are still loose.

846
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:13,801
And if you see one,
don't try to restrain him yourselves.

847
01:06:13,908 --> 01:06:16,274
These fuckers will kill you. Clear?

848
01:06:17,378 --> 01:06:20,245
All right, get your asses moving then.
Go on.

849
01:07:17,038 --> 01:07:18,300
He's here.

850
01:07:22,376 --> 01:07:25,743
Laeddis. l can feel him.

851
01:07:30,051 --> 01:07:31,780
Tag! You're it!

852
01:07:31,886 --> 01:07:33,854
Wait! Boss! Ted!

853
01:07:43,431 --> 01:07:45,058
Hey! Hey!

854
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:47,659
Teddy.

855
01:08:29,677 --> 01:08:31,110
Listen to me.

856
01:08:32,213 --> 01:08:35,114
Listen, l don't wanna leave here,
all right?

857
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:37,778
l mean, why would anybody want to?

858
01:08:37,885 --> 01:08:41,343
We hear things here
about the outside world.

859
01:08:41,455 --> 01:08:44,856
-About atolls, about H-bomb tests.
-Teddy, where are you?

860
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:46,927
You know how a hydrogen bomb works?

861
01:08:47,028 --> 01:08:50,259
-l know. With hydrogen! With hydrogen.
-Ah, that's funny.

862
01:08:50,364 --> 01:08:53,231
-Boss!
-Other bombs explode, right?

863
01:08:54,101 --> 01:08:55,693
But not the hydrogen bomb.

864
01:08:55,803 --> 01:09:01,207
lt implodes, creating an explosion
to the thousandth, the millionth degree!

865
01:09:01,709 --> 01:09:03,301
-Do you get it?
-Yeah! Yeah.

866
01:09:03,411 --> 01:09:04,969
-Do you?
-l get it, l get it!

867
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:06,307
Let him go!

868
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,008
No!

869
01:09:20,328 --> 01:09:22,296
No! No!

870
01:09:23,731 --> 01:09:25,460
What are you doing?

871
01:09:25,766 --> 01:09:28,462
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

872
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:32,636
Oh, you got Billings. What the fuck's
the matter with you guys?

873
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,798
Catch them, not kill them!

874
01:09:33,908 --> 01:09:36,843
-He jumped us.
-You, give me a hand with him.

875
01:09:36,944 --> 01:09:39,344
We've gotta get him to the infirmary.
God damn it.

876
01:09:39,447 --> 01:09:43,144
No, no! Not you, not you.
Take a walk. Come on.

877
01:09:43,718 --> 01:09:46,152
Cawley's gonna have my goddamn balls
for this.

878
01:10:17,252 --> 01:10:19,413
Laeddis.

879
01:10:39,675 --> 01:10:41,233
Laeddis.

880
01:10:52,321 --> 01:10:54,050
Stop me, please,

881
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:56,514
before l kill more.

882
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,028
Stop me before l kill more.

883
01:11:01,463 --> 01:11:03,328
Laeddis.

884
01:11:11,473 --> 01:11:13,338
Please, please.

885
01:11:17,646 --> 01:11:19,580
l see you all.

886
01:11:20,349 --> 01:11:23,682
Laeddis.

887
01:11:30,092 --> 01:11:35,496
You told me l'd be free of this place.
You promised.

888
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:38,832
You lied.

889
01:11:39,434 --> 01:11:40,696
Laeddis.

890
01:11:46,241 --> 01:11:47,572
Laeddis?

891
01:11:49,378 --> 01:11:51,073
That's pretty damn funny.

892
01:11:53,048 --> 01:11:55,539
-Your voice.
-Don't you recognize it?

893
01:11:56,885 --> 01:11:58,978
After all the talks we had?

894
01:11:59,922 --> 01:12:01,947
After all the lies you told me?

895
01:12:02,057 --> 01:12:03,820
Let me see your face.

896
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:06,293
They say l'm theirs now.

897
01:12:07,462 --> 01:12:09,726
They say l'll never leave here.

898
01:12:11,033 --> 01:12:13,160
Your match is about to go out.

899
01:12:15,771 --> 01:12:18,501
-Let me see your goddamn face! Now!
-Why?

900
01:12:18,941 --> 01:12:22,399
So you can lie to me more?
This isn't about the truth.

901
01:12:22,511 --> 01:12:26,208
-Yes, it is. lt's about exposing the truth.
-lt's about you!

902
01:12:27,482 --> 01:12:31,680
And Laeddis.
That's all it's ever been about.

903
01:12:33,355 --> 01:12:37,018
l was incidental. A way in.

904
01:12:40,395 --> 01:12:44,855
George... George Noyce. No.

905
01:12:45,434 --> 01:12:47,664
lt's not possible. You can't be here.

906
01:12:47,769 --> 01:12:49,134
You like it?

907
01:12:50,873 --> 01:12:52,773
Who did this to you, George?

908
01:12:52,875 --> 01:12:54,069
You did.

909
01:12:54,676 --> 01:12:56,075
What the hell do you mean?

910
01:12:56,178 --> 01:13:00,308
All your talk. All your fucking talk,
and l'm back in here because of you.

911
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:02,975
George, how did they get you
out of Dedham, huh?

912
01:13:03,085 --> 01:13:04,245
However this happened, l...

913
01:13:04,353 --> 01:13:06,287
l'm gonna find a way to fix this,
you understand me?

914
01:13:06,388 --> 01:13:10,256
l'll never get out now. l got out once.
Not twice, never twice.

915
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:12,190
Just tell me how they got you here.

916
01:13:12,294 --> 01:13:14,990
They knew! Don't you get it?

917
01:13:15,697 --> 01:13:18,427
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

918
01:13:19,268 --> 01:13:22,897
This is a game. All of this is for you.

919
01:13:23,639 --> 01:13:28,076
You're not investigating anything.
You're a fucking rat in a maze.

920
01:13:29,478 --> 01:13:32,936
Georgie... George, you're wrong.
You're wrong.

921
01:13:33,048 --> 01:13:37,109
Oh, really?
Been alone much since you got here?

922
01:13:39,187 --> 01:13:40,848
l've been with my partner.

923
01:13:41,523 --> 01:13:43,252
You never worked with him before,
have you?

924
01:13:45,661 --> 01:13:48,061
He's a U.S. Marshal. He's...

925
01:13:48,163 --> 01:13:50,961
You never worked with him before,
have you?

926
01:13:53,802 --> 01:13:57,636
George, look, l know people.
l trust this man.

927
01:14:02,644 --> 01:14:04,612
Then they've already won.

928
01:14:07,616 --> 01:14:08,674
Fuck.

929
01:14:13,488 --> 01:14:16,480
And they're gonna take me
to the lighthouse.

930
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,957
They're gonna cut into my brain.

931
01:14:21,463 --> 01:14:24,796
And l'm only here because of you!

932
01:14:25,801 --> 01:14:28,133
George, l'm gonna get you out of here.

933
01:14:28,236 --> 01:14:30,500
You're not going to the lighthouse.
You're not.

934
01:14:30,605 --> 01:14:33,335
You can't dig out the truth
and kill Laeddis at the same time.

935
01:14:33,442 --> 01:14:36,969
You gotta make a choice.
You understand that, don't you?

936
01:14:37,446 --> 01:14:39,175
l'm not here to kill anyone.

937
01:14:39,281 --> 01:14:40,407
Liar!

938
01:14:40,515 --> 01:14:43,575
l'm not gonna kill him, l swear to you!
l swear.

939
01:14:43,852 --> 01:14:45,183
She's dead.

940
01:14:46,254 --> 01:14:47,881
She... Let her go.

941
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:50,789
Let her go.

942
01:14:51,827 --> 01:14:54,489
Tell him, Teddy. Tell him why.

943
01:14:57,799 --> 01:15:00,393
You gotta do it. There's no other way.

944
01:15:01,069 --> 01:15:02,559
-Let her go.
-Tell him about the day

945
01:15:02,671 --> 01:15:05,504
-you brought me my locket.
-You gotta do it!

946
01:15:05,607 --> 01:15:09,008
How l told you my heart was breaking
and you asked me why.

947
01:15:09,111 --> 01:15:11,978
She's fucking with your head.

948
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,945
And l told you it was from happiness.

949
01:15:14,049 --> 01:15:16,483
She's gonna kill you.
She's gonna kill you.

950
01:15:19,554 --> 01:15:22,751
You wanna uncover the truth?
You gotta let her go.

951
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,621
-l can't.
-You have to let her go!

952
01:15:26,728 --> 01:15:28,559
l can't! l can't.

953
01:15:35,504 --> 01:15:37,995
Then you'll never leave this island.

954
01:15:43,779 --> 01:15:44,973
Dolores.

955
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,578
He's not in this ward.

956
01:15:55,824 --> 01:15:58,793
He was transferred out of here.

957
01:16:00,996 --> 01:16:05,831
lf he's not in Ward A,
there's only one place he can be.

958
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:13,230
The lighthouse.

959
01:16:20,615 --> 01:16:21,639
Hey,

960
01:16:24,219 --> 01:16:25,652
God help you.

961
01:16:34,529 --> 01:16:38,431
Boss, we got problems. McPherson
and Cawley are in the building.

962
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:40,262
They heard an orderly went batshit
on a patient.

963
01:16:40,368 --> 01:16:43,235
They're looking all over the place for
him and they're on their way to the roof.

964
01:16:43,338 --> 01:16:45,203
Let's get the hell out of here. This way.

965
01:16:48,243 --> 01:16:50,541
Just keep going. We belong here.

966
01:17:00,422 --> 01:17:01,623
What happened to you?

967
01:17:01,623 --> 01:17:02,180
What happened to you?

968
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:03,882
-What do you mean?
-l mean,

969
01:17:04,292 --> 01:17:05,782
where were you?

970
01:17:06,194 --> 01:17:10,927
After we got that guy to the infirmary,
l took a little detour to patient records.

971
01:17:11,032 --> 01:17:13,159
Did you ever find Laeddis?

972
01:17:13,268 --> 01:17:15,133
No. No, l never found him.

973
01:17:15,237 --> 01:17:18,172
Well, l got the next best thing.
His intake form.

974
01:17:18,273 --> 01:17:20,366
lt was the only thing in his files.
There's no session notes,

975
01:17:20,475 --> 01:17:24,172
no incident reports, no photographs,
just this. lt was weird.

976
01:17:24,279 --> 01:17:25,906
Here. Take a look.

977
01:17:26,781 --> 01:17:28,078
l'll look at it later.

978
01:17:30,085 --> 01:17:31,347
What's the matter, boss?

979
01:17:32,254 --> 01:17:34,745
l'll look it over later, that's all.

980
01:17:36,725 --> 01:17:40,058
-Ashecliffe's that way.
-l'm not going to Ashecliffe.

981
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:43,564
l'm going to that lighthouse.

982
01:17:43,665 --> 01:17:45,963
l'm gonna find out what the fuck
is happening on this island.

983
01:18:00,148 --> 01:18:01,513
There it is.

984
01:18:02,384 --> 01:18:06,377
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to double back.

985
01:18:06,488 --> 01:18:08,649
There's no way we could cross
those rocks.

986
01:18:08,757 --> 01:18:10,418
There could be a way
behind those trees.

987
01:18:10,525 --> 01:18:13,585
Maybe a path that goes around the
rocks and leads over to the lighthouse.

988
01:18:13,695 --> 01:18:14,719
-Boss...
-Come on.

989
01:18:14,829 --> 01:18:17,161
Wait, wait, what are we doing?
We got the intake form.

990
01:18:17,265 --> 01:18:19,028
lt's proof there's a 67th patient,

991
01:18:19,134 --> 01:18:21,967
which they said, repeatedly,
doesn't exist.

992
01:18:22,437 --> 01:18:25,600
l'm getting to that lighthouse.
You understand?

993
01:18:27,976 --> 01:18:29,671
What the hell can l say to you
to stop you?

994
01:18:29,778 --> 01:18:32,076
Why would you want to, Chuck? Why?

995
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,977
Because climbing down there
when it's dark

996
01:18:34,082 --> 01:18:37,210
is a thin step short of suicide,
that's why.

997
01:18:37,319 --> 01:18:40,720
Okay, maybe you better sit
this one out then.

998
01:18:42,357 --> 01:18:45,622
You brought me into this, boss,
and now we're trapped here

999
01:18:45,727 --> 01:18:49,356
on this rock, on this island,
with no one to rely on but each other,

1000
01:18:49,464 --> 01:18:51,432
and now you're acting like...

1001
01:18:51,533 --> 01:18:54,468
Like what? Like what? How am l acting?

1002
01:18:59,374 --> 01:19:02,775
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

1003
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:10,780
What do you think the weather's like
in Portland, Chuck?

1004
01:19:10,885 --> 01:19:12,477
l'm from Seattle.

1005
01:19:15,156 --> 01:19:16,384
Seattle.

1006
01:19:19,628 --> 01:19:22,324
l'm going on alone.

1007
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:28,133
-l'm going with you, boss.
-l said alone.

1008
01:19:29,904 --> 01:19:30,962
Fine.

1009
01:19:57,666 --> 01:19:58,894
Damn it!

1010
01:19:59,934 --> 01:20:01,162
Damn it.

1011
01:20:06,441 --> 01:20:09,274
l knew it wouldn't take long,
but l couldn't get to it.

1012
01:20:09,377 --> 01:20:10,901
The tide was up.

1013
01:20:19,187 --> 01:20:20,279
Chuck!

1014
01:20:22,857 --> 01:20:23,983
Chuck!

1015
01:21:25,587 --> 01:21:26,781
Come on!

1016
01:22:02,223 --> 01:22:03,349
Chuck!

1017
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:05,823
Where are you, Chuck?

1018
01:22:30,518 --> 01:22:31,678
Chuck!

1019
01:22:33,455 --> 01:22:34,581
Chuck!

1020
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,465
Who are you?

1021
01:23:22,604 --> 01:23:25,437
l'm Teddy Daniels. l'm a cop.

1022
01:23:26,841 --> 01:23:28,502
You're the marshal.

1023
01:23:29,577 --> 01:23:30,976
That's right.

1024
01:23:33,348 --> 01:23:37,216
Would you mind taking your hand
from behind your back, please?

1025
01:23:37,318 --> 01:23:39,081
Why? Why?

1026
01:23:40,655 --> 01:23:43,624
l wanna make sure that
what you're holding won't hurt me.

1027
01:23:51,299 --> 01:23:52,994
l'm gonna keep this

1028
01:23:54,536 --> 01:23:56,003
if you don't mind.

1029
01:23:56,871 --> 01:23:58,236
Fine by me.

1030
01:24:07,348 --> 01:24:08,645
You're...

1031
01:24:10,084 --> 01:24:11,881
You're Rachel Solando.

1032
01:24:13,488 --> 01:24:14,887
The real one.

1033
01:24:18,927 --> 01:24:20,519
Did you kill your children?

1034
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:24,127
l never had children.

1035
01:24:24,866 --> 01:24:26,595
l was never married.

1036
01:24:28,169 --> 01:24:31,696
And before l was a patient at Ashecliffe,
l worked here.

1037
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:34,900
You... You were a nurse?

1038
01:24:37,278 --> 01:24:39,212
l was a doctor, Marshal.

1039
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:44,345
You think l'm crazy.

1040
01:24:44,752 --> 01:24:48,051
-No. No, no, l never...
-And if l say l'm not crazy?

1041
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:51,656
Well, that hardly helps, does it?

1042
01:24:52,527 --> 01:24:55,018
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1043
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:00,597
People tell the world you're crazy,

1044
01:25:00,702 --> 01:25:04,604
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirm what they're saying.

1045
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:08,333
l'm not following you. l'm sorry.

1046
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:10,978
Once you're declared insane,

1047
01:25:11,079 --> 01:25:14,537
then anything you do
is called part of that insanity.

1048
01:25:14,649 --> 01:25:20,212
Reasonable protests are denial.
Valid fears, paranoia.

1049
01:25:20,321 --> 01:25:24,348
Survival instincts
are defense mechanisms.

1050
01:25:24,692 --> 01:25:28,389
You're smarter than you look, Marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1051
01:25:29,297 --> 01:25:30,730
Tell me something.

1052
01:25:30,832 --> 01:25:31,924
Yeah.

1053
01:25:33,134 --> 01:25:34,897
What happened to you?

1054
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:39,137
l started asking about these
large shipments of sodium amytal

1055
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,003
and opium-based hallucinogens.

1056
01:25:41,109 --> 01:25:42,770
Psychotropic drugs.

1057
01:25:44,178 --> 01:25:46,510
l asked about the surgeries, too.

1058
01:25:48,616 --> 01:25:50,709
You ever heard of
a transorbital lobotomy?

1059
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,016
They zap the patient with electroshock,

1060
01:25:55,123 --> 01:25:57,887
then go through the eye with an ice pick,

1061
01:26:00,094 --> 01:26:02,153
pull out some nerve fibers.

1062
01:26:04,599 --> 01:26:07,067
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1063
01:26:07,168 --> 01:26:08,465
Tractable.

1064
01:26:09,971 --> 01:26:11,438
lt's barbaric,

1065
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:13,907
unconscionable.

1066
01:26:14,976 --> 01:26:18,673
Do you know how pain
enters the body, Marshal? Do you?

1067
01:26:19,981 --> 01:26:21,414
Depends on where you're hurt?

1068
01:26:21,516 --> 01:26:26,647
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.
The brain controls pain.

1069
01:26:27,321 --> 01:26:31,655
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep,
hunger, anger. Everything.

1070
01:26:34,028 --> 01:26:35,791
What if you could control it?

1071
01:26:36,297 --> 01:26:37,764
You mean the brain?

1072
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:44,600
Recreate a man so he doesn't feel
pain or love or sympathy.

1073
01:26:46,107 --> 01:26:47,574
A man who can't be interrogated,

1074
01:26:47,675 --> 01:26:50,337
because he has no memories
to confess.

1075
01:26:52,947 --> 01:26:56,610
You can never take away
all a man's memories. Never.

1076
01:26:56,718 --> 01:27:00,814
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1077
01:27:00,922 --> 01:27:02,583
during their brainwashing experiments.

1078
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:06,091
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

1079
01:27:06,194 --> 01:27:08,253
They're creating ghosts
to go out in the world

1080
01:27:08,362 --> 01:27:11,559
and do things sane men...
Sane men never would.

1081
01:27:11,666 --> 01:27:14,999
To have that kind of ability,
that kind of knowledge,

1082
01:27:15,103 --> 01:27:17,333
-that would take years.
-Years. Years of research.

1083
01:27:17,839 --> 01:27:20,535
Hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1084
01:27:21,809 --> 01:27:24,209
Fifty years from now,
people will look back

1085
01:27:24,312 --> 01:27:27,645
and say, here, this place,
is where it all began.

1086
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:33,149
The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used
prisoners in their own Gulags,

1087
01:27:34,055 --> 01:27:37,456
and we tested patients
on Shutter lsland.

1088
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,787
No, they won't.

1089
01:27:41,796 --> 01:27:42,763
No.

1090
01:27:45,266 --> 01:27:47,359
You do understand

1091
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:52,201
that they can't let you leave.

1092
01:27:52,507 --> 01:27:55,806
l am a federal marshal.
They can't stop me.

1093
01:27:57,245 --> 01:28:02,273
l was an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family.

1094
01:28:04,418 --> 01:28:05,976
Didn't matter.

1095
01:28:08,756 --> 01:28:10,314
Let me ask you.

1096
01:28:10,424 --> 01:28:12,756
Any past traumas in your life?

1097
01:28:14,162 --> 01:28:15,356
Yes.

1098
01:28:16,564 --> 01:28:18,623
But why would that matter?

1099
01:28:18,733 --> 01:28:21,031
Because they're gonna point
to some event in your past

1100
01:28:21,135 --> 01:28:23,603
and say it's the reason
you lost your sanity.

1101
01:28:23,704 --> 01:28:29,074
So that when they commit you here,
your friends and colleagues will say,

1102
01:28:29,177 --> 01:28:31,042
''Of course he cracked.

1103
01:28:32,113 --> 01:28:33,341
''Who wouldn't after what
he'd been through?''

1104
01:28:33,447 --> 01:28:35,915
They can say that about anyone,
anyone at all.

1105
01:28:36,017 --> 01:28:38,952
The point is
they're gonna say it about you.

1106
01:28:42,223 --> 01:28:43,815
How's your head?

1107
01:28:43,925 --> 01:28:46,018
My head?

1108
01:28:46,127 --> 01:28:49,494
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

1109
01:28:51,732 --> 01:28:56,066
-Headaches?
-l am prone to migraines, yes.

1110
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:57,432
Jesus.

1111
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:03,232
You haven't taken any pills, have you?
l mean, even aspirin?

1112
01:29:03,344 --> 01:29:05,471
-The aspirin?
-Jesus.

1113
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:09,843
And you ate the food in the cafeteria
and drank the coffee they gave you?

1114
01:29:09,951 --> 01:29:13,318
You tell me, at least, that you've
been smoking your own cigarettes.

1115
01:29:15,156 --> 01:29:16,316
No.

1116
01:29:17,325 --> 01:29:18,383
No.

1117
01:29:19,527 --> 01:29:20,858
No, l haven't.

1118
01:29:20,962 --> 01:29:23,726
lt takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics

1119
01:29:23,831 --> 01:29:26,356
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

1120
01:29:28,202 --> 01:29:29,999
Palsy comes first,

1121
01:29:30,938 --> 01:29:34,374
first the fingertips,
then eventually the whole hand.

1122
01:29:35,343 --> 01:29:39,473
Seen any walking nightmares
lately, Marshal?

1123
01:29:41,983 --> 01:29:44,918
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse.

1124
01:29:45,853 --> 01:29:47,150
Tell me.

1125
01:29:48,356 --> 01:29:49,914
Brain surgery.

1126
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:55,062
The let's-open-the-skull-and-see-
what-happens-if-we-pull-on-this kind.

1127
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:58,463
The learned-it-from-the-Nazis kind.

1128
01:30:00,601 --> 01:30:03,035
That's where they create the ghosts.

1129
01:30:04,472 --> 01:30:08,340
Who knows about this?
On the island, l mean. Who?

1130
01:30:10,678 --> 01:30:11,940
Everyone.

1131
01:30:12,046 --> 01:30:15,709
Come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1132
01:30:16,317 --> 01:30:19,582
-They couldn't possibly know...
-Everyone.

1133
01:30:38,572 --> 01:30:40,062
You can't stay here.

1134
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:42,005
They think l'm dead, that l drowned.

1135
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:45,078
l'm afraid if they come looking for you,
they might find me.

1136
01:30:45,179 --> 01:30:47,545
l'm sorry, but you have to go.

1137
01:30:54,188 --> 01:30:55,780
l'm gonna come back for you.

1138
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:58,859
l won't be here. l move during the day.
New places every night.

1139
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,258
But l could come get you,
get you off this island.

1140
01:31:01,362 --> 01:31:04,058
Haven't you heard a word l've said?

1141
01:31:04,165 --> 01:31:08,261
The only way off the island is the ferry,
and they control it.

1142
01:31:08,369 --> 01:31:10,360
You'll never leave here.

1143
01:31:19,747 --> 01:31:21,544
l had a friend.

1144
01:31:21,649 --> 01:31:25,141
l was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1145
01:31:25,252 --> 01:31:26,879
Have you seen him?

1146
01:31:28,089 --> 01:31:29,420
Marshal,

1147
01:31:30,992 --> 01:31:33,085
you have no friends.

1148
01:32:05,426 --> 01:32:06,916
There you are.

1149
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:12,458
We were wondering
when you'd show up.

1150
01:32:14,101 --> 01:32:15,591
Have a seat.

1151
01:32:16,103 --> 01:32:17,365
Come on.

1152
01:32:28,082 --> 01:32:30,676
Taking a leisurely stroll, were we?

1153
01:32:31,786 --> 01:32:34,778
l was just looking around.

1154
01:32:37,792 --> 01:32:40,192
Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

1155
01:32:41,829 --> 01:32:43,126
-What?
-God's gift.

1156
01:32:45,332 --> 01:32:46,663
The violence.

1157
01:32:49,537 --> 01:32:53,871
When l came downstairs in my home
and l saw that tree in my living room,

1158
01:32:53,974 --> 01:32:57,774
it reached out for me like a divine hand.

1159
01:33:00,047 --> 01:33:01,810
God loves violence.

1160
01:33:04,518 --> 01:33:07,316
-l hadn't noticed.
-Sure you have.

1161
01:33:08,522 --> 01:33:13,619
Why else would there be so much of it?
lt's in us. lt's what we are.

1162
01:33:15,696 --> 01:33:18,028
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,

1163
01:33:18,132 --> 01:33:20,657
and pillage and plunder
and tear at the flesh of our brothers.

1164
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:24,636
And why? Because God gave us
violence to wage in his honor.

1165
01:33:27,908 --> 01:33:30,274
l thought God gave us moral order.

1166
01:33:30,377 --> 01:33:33,346
There's no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1167
01:33:34,014 --> 01:33:36,278
There's no moral order at all.

1168
01:33:36,617 --> 01:33:40,109
There's just this,
can my violence conquer yours?

1169
01:33:45,726 --> 01:33:48,126
-l'm not violent.
-Yes, you are.

1170
01:33:49,296 --> 01:33:51,662
You're as violent as they come.

1171
01:33:52,433 --> 01:33:55,994
l know this
because l'm as violent as they come.

1172
01:33:56,103 --> 01:33:58,230
lf the constraints of society were lifted,

1173
01:33:58,339 --> 01:34:00,967
and l was all that stood
between you and a meal,

1174
01:34:01,075 --> 01:34:04,841
you would crack my skull with a rock
and eat my meaty parts.

1175
01:34:06,413 --> 01:34:07,971
Wouldn't you?

1176
01:34:10,751 --> 01:34:13,219
Cawley thinks you're harmless,
that you can be controlled,

1177
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,151
but l know different.

1178
01:34:15,823 --> 01:34:17,552
-You don't know me.
-Oh, but l do.

1179
01:34:17,658 --> 01:34:20,786
-No, you don't. You don't know me at all.
-Oh, l know you.

1180
01:34:20,895 --> 01:34:23,557
We've known each other for centuries.

1181
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:35,875
lf l was to sink my teeth
into your eye right now,

1182
01:34:35,976 --> 01:34:39,241
would you be able to stop me
before l blinded you?

1183
01:34:43,417 --> 01:34:45,009
Give it a try.

1184
01:34:46,587 --> 01:34:48,282
That's the spirit.

1185
01:35:23,057 --> 01:35:25,651
Don't worry, because we're going
to get you back to your room.

1186
01:35:27,294 --> 01:35:28,955
-Not really.
-Something l've seen.

1187
01:35:29,063 --> 01:35:30,257
Okay.

1188
01:35:35,502 --> 01:35:37,231
Where have you been?

1189
01:35:37,338 --> 01:35:40,068
Oh, just wandering.
Just looking at your island.

1190
01:35:40,174 --> 01:35:43,803
Oh, l forgot you're leaving
now that Rachel's been found.

1191
01:35:44,712 --> 01:35:46,111
-Stop looking at him.
-For sure. Yeah.

1192
01:35:46,213 --> 01:35:49,444
Stop looking at him. Stop looking at him.

1193
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:51,518
-Big meeting?
-Oh, yes.

1194
01:35:51,619 --> 01:35:53,246
-lt's okay. l'm...
-l don't like that.

1195
01:35:53,354 --> 01:35:55,345
Apparently there was
an unidentified man

1196
01:35:55,456 --> 01:35:56,718
in Ward C yesterday.

1197
01:35:56,824 --> 01:36:00,157
He subdued a highly dangerous patient
quite handily.

1198
01:36:00,794 --> 01:36:01,761
ls that so?

1199
01:36:01,862 --> 01:36:04,330
lt seems he had a long conversation
with a paranoid schizophrenic,

1200
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:05,591
George Noyce.

1201
01:36:05,699 --> 01:36:08,497
Well, l don't remember
what l'm supposed to remember.

1202
01:36:08,602 --> 01:36:10,297
We're gated down. We're fine.

1203
01:36:10,404 --> 01:36:14,397
This Noyce, you said
his name was, he's delusional?

1204
01:36:14,508 --> 01:36:17,204
Extremely. He can be quite upsetting.

1205
01:36:17,311 --> 01:36:19,006
As a matter of fact, two weeks ago,

1206
01:36:19,113 --> 01:36:23,550
a patient got so wound up by one
of Noyce's stories that he beat him up.

1207
01:36:24,818 --> 01:36:26,217
Cigarette?

1208
01:36:28,022 --> 01:36:29,785
No, thanks. l quit.

1209
01:36:30,924 --> 01:36:34,917
-So you're taking the ferry?
-Yes, absolutely.

1210
01:36:35,029 --> 01:36:38,487
l think we've gotten
all we came here for, so...

1211
01:36:38,599 --> 01:36:39,896
''We,'' Marshal?

1212
01:36:41,935 --> 01:36:45,462
Speaking of which,
have you seen him, Doctor?

1213
01:36:45,606 --> 01:36:46,732
Who?

1214
01:36:47,574 --> 01:36:49,269
My partner, Chuck.

1215
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:54,443
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

1216
01:36:56,917 --> 01:36:59,078
You know, l've built
something valuable here,

1217
01:36:59,186 --> 01:37:02,314
and valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

1218
01:37:02,423 --> 01:37:04,482
Everyone wants a quick fix.
They always have.

1219
01:37:04,591 --> 01:37:08,186
l'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

1220
01:37:08,295 --> 01:37:11,196
And l'm not going to give up
without a fight.

1221
01:37:13,067 --> 01:37:14,659
l can see that.

1222
01:37:18,772 --> 01:37:21,366
So, tell me again about your partner.

1223
01:37:23,143 --> 01:37:24,701
What partner?

1224
01:37:27,514 --> 01:37:28,538
lt's fine.

1225
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:20,696
She made a mess. l cleaned it up.
She made a mess again.

1226
01:38:30,043 --> 01:38:31,374
Marshal,

1227
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:34,372
going somewhere?

1228
01:38:34,681 --> 01:38:37,809
l'm just heading out to the ferry, so...

1229
01:38:38,352 --> 01:38:41,879
Oh, well, l'm afraid it's the other way.

1230
01:38:44,858 --> 01:38:49,522
lf you'll wait a moment, l'll find you
someone who can take you to the dock.

1231
01:38:54,234 --> 01:38:58,034
-What's this, Doctor? What's this?
-lt's just a sedative.

1232
01:38:58,138 --> 01:39:01,266
-A precaution.
-A precaution.

1233
01:39:04,244 --> 01:39:08,271
What are you going to do?
Kill me? Marshal.

1234
01:39:08,682 --> 01:39:10,206
You think you deserve it?

1235
01:39:10,317 --> 01:39:13,081
For what? Provoking you?

1236
01:39:13,921 --> 01:39:16,719
Well, forgive me.
What doesn't provoke you?

1237
01:39:17,291 --> 01:39:20,351
-Remarks? Words?
-Nazis?

1238
01:39:20,861 --> 01:39:24,888
Well, that, too.
And, of course, memories, dreams.

1239
01:39:25,999 --> 01:39:30,231
Did you know that the word ''trauma''
comes from the Greek for ''wound''?

1240
01:39:30,938 --> 01:39:33,634
And what is the German word
for ''dream''?

1241
01:39:37,311 --> 01:39:40,212
Wounds can create monsters,
and you...

1242
01:39:40,948 --> 01:39:43,280
You are wounded, Marshal.

1243
01:39:44,351 --> 01:39:47,479
And wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster,

1244
01:39:48,222 --> 01:39:49,951
you must stop it?

1245
01:39:50,557 --> 01:39:51,717
Yeah.

1246
01:39:52,926 --> 01:39:54,757
-l agree.
-Yes.

1247
01:39:55,596 --> 01:39:56,654
Yeah.

1248
01:40:13,914 --> 01:40:16,144
l told him that we'd take
about an hour to do it.

1249
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:19,310
Yeah. Did they say
we're going to do the first floor?

1250
01:40:19,419 --> 01:40:20,647
How long you been on the clock?

1251
01:40:20,754 --> 01:40:24,417
-l've been on for 18 hours straight.
-Nice paycheck.

1252
01:40:41,608 --> 01:40:43,667
What are you doing, baby?

1253
01:40:48,482 --> 01:40:50,950
-You gotta get to the ferry.
-No.

1254
01:40:51,752 --> 01:40:53,014
No, no.

1255
01:40:54,254 --> 01:40:55,380
Yeah.

1256
01:40:56,557 --> 01:41:01,392
lf the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he's perfect for their experiments.

1257
01:41:02,496 --> 01:41:04,726
There's only one place they'd take him.

1258
01:41:07,401 --> 01:41:08,993
You go there and you'll die.

1259
01:41:09,102 --> 01:41:10,729
He's my partner. lf they are hurting him,

1260
01:41:10,837 --> 01:41:14,000
if they're holding him against his will,
l've gotta bring him out.

1261
01:41:14,107 --> 01:41:16,132
l can't lose anyone else.

1262
01:41:16,243 --> 01:41:17,471
Don't go, Teddy, please.

1263
01:41:17,578 --> 01:41:20,945
-Please, don't do this. Don't go.
-l'm sorry, honey.

1264
01:41:24,585 --> 01:41:26,314
l'm sorry, honey.

1265
01:41:27,454 --> 01:41:30,446
l love this thing
because you gave it to me,

1266
01:41:32,859 --> 01:41:34,656
but the truth is

1267
01:41:36,363 --> 01:41:38,490
it is one fucking ugly tie.

1268
01:42:18,772 --> 01:42:19,864
No.

1269
01:43:41,855 --> 01:43:43,186
Don't move. Stay where you are.

1270
01:43:45,225 --> 01:43:46,590
Are you gonna kill me?

1271
01:43:48,295 --> 01:43:50,786
No, l'm not gonna kill you.

1272
01:45:43,476 --> 01:45:45,307
Why are you all wet, baby?

1273
01:45:47,547 --> 01:45:50,778
-What did you say?
-You know exactly what l said.

1274
01:46:03,897 --> 01:46:06,092
The rifle's empty, by the way.

1275
01:46:12,672 --> 01:46:14,139
Have a seat.

1276
01:46:20,647 --> 01:46:23,047
For God's sake, dry off.
You'll catch cold.

1277
01:46:24,718 --> 01:46:25,776
All right.

1278
01:46:29,389 --> 01:46:31,254
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1279
01:46:33,026 --> 01:46:35,995
l don't know what you're talking about.

1280
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:41,099
Yes, he's here.

1281
01:46:41,201 --> 01:46:45,160
Have Dr. Sheehan take a look at
your man before you send him up.

1282
01:46:45,272 --> 01:46:49,936
So Dr. Sheehan came in
on the ferry this morning, huh?

1283
01:46:50,944 --> 01:46:52,411
Not exactly.

1284
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:56,472
You blew up my car.
l really loved that car.

1285
01:46:57,450 --> 01:46:59,509
Sorry to hear about that.

1286
01:47:02,822 --> 01:47:05,154
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1287
01:47:05,825 --> 01:47:08,225
How are the hallucinations?

1288
01:47:08,328 --> 01:47:10,592
Get out of here, Teddy.

1289
01:47:10,697 --> 01:47:12,460
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1290
01:47:16,269 --> 01:47:17,361
Not bad.

1291
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:20,030
-They'll get worse.
-l know.

1292
01:47:20,941 --> 01:47:25,173
Dr. Solando,
she told me about the neuroleptics.

1293
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:28,213
Did she, now? And when was this?

1294
01:47:28,315 --> 01:47:33,082
l found her, Doctor,
in a cave out by the cliffs.

1295
01:47:33,186 --> 01:47:34,551
But you'll never get to her.

1296
01:47:34,654 --> 01:47:38,055
l don't doubt it,
considering she's not real.

1297
01:47:40,293 --> 01:47:43,387
Your delusions are more severe
than l thought.

1298
01:47:44,631 --> 01:47:46,758
You're not on neuroleptics.

1299
01:47:47,233 --> 01:47:49,098
You're not on anything,
as a matter of fact.

1300
01:47:49,202 --> 01:47:51,796
Then what the fuck is this?
What the fuck is this?

1301
01:47:51,905 --> 01:47:52,872
Withdrawal.

1302
01:47:53,907 --> 01:47:55,875
Withdrawal? From what?

1303
01:47:55,976 --> 01:47:58,274
l haven't had a goddamn drink
since l've been on this island.

1304
01:47:58,378 --> 01:47:59,970
Chlorpromazine.

1305
01:48:00,847 --> 01:48:04,476
l'm not a fan of pharmacology,
but l have to say, in your case...

1306
01:48:04,584 --> 01:48:07,815
-Chloraproma-what?
-Chlorpromazine.

1307
01:48:07,921 --> 01:48:11,880
The same thing we've been giving you
for the past 24 months.

1308
01:48:13,226 --> 01:48:15,319
So for the past two years, you...

1309
01:48:15,428 --> 01:48:18,727
You've had somebody slipping me drugs
in Boston. ls that it?

1310
01:48:18,832 --> 01:48:20,231
Not Boston.

1311
01:48:20,767 --> 01:48:21,927
Here.

1312
01:48:22,736 --> 01:48:26,672
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

1313
01:48:30,443 --> 01:48:34,209
After everything l've seen here, Doctor,

1314
01:48:34,314 --> 01:48:37,681
you really think you're gonna
convince me l'm crazy?

1315
01:48:37,784 --> 01:48:39,752
Do you know the kind of people
that l deal with every day?

1316
01:48:39,853 --> 01:48:41,684
l'm a U.S. Marshal, for God's sakes.

1317
01:48:41,788 --> 01:48:43,653
You were a U.S. Marshal.

1318
01:48:43,757 --> 01:48:47,523
Here's a copy of the intake form
you broke into Ward C for.

1319
01:48:47,627 --> 01:48:48,992
Proof of the 67th patient.

1320
01:48:49,095 --> 01:48:50,255
lf you'd gotten it to the mainland,

1321
01:48:50,363 --> 01:48:52,126
you could have
blown the lid off this place.

1322
01:48:52,232 --> 01:48:53,324
Wait. Where did... Where did you...

1323
01:48:53,433 --> 01:48:55,196
Yet somehow,
you couldn't find time to look at it.

1324
01:48:55,301 --> 01:48:56,996
Well, read it now.

1325
01:48:57,504 --> 01:48:58,835
Go ahead.

1326
01:49:02,675 --> 01:49:06,475
''Patient is highly intelligent, highly
delusional decorated Army veteran.

1327
01:49:06,579 --> 01:49:10,310
''Present for the liberation of Dachau.

1328
01:49:10,417 --> 01:49:13,011
''Former U.S. Marshal.
Known proclivity for violence.

1329
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:16,350
''Shows no remorse for his crime
because he denies the crime ever...

1330
01:49:16,456 --> 01:49:17,480
''Ever took place.

1331
01:49:17,590 --> 01:49:19,455
''Highly developed
and fantastical narratives,

1332
01:49:19,559 --> 01:49:21,891
''which preclude facing
the truth of his actions.''

1333
01:49:21,995 --> 01:49:23,053
l've had enough of this bullshit!

1334
01:49:23,163 --> 01:49:27,031
Where's my partner? Where's Chuck?
Where is he?

1335
01:49:27,133 --> 01:49:28,828
Let's try this another way.

1336
01:49:28,935 --> 01:49:31,460
Your wife's maiden name was Chanal,
am l correct?

1337
01:49:31,571 --> 01:49:32,970
Don't you even talk about her.
Don't you...

1338
01:49:33,073 --> 01:49:34,904
l'm afraid l have to.

1339
01:49:37,010 --> 01:49:41,208
Notice anything these four names
have in common? lt's your rule of four.

1340
01:49:41,314 --> 01:49:42,440
Andrew, what do you see?

1341
01:49:42,549 --> 01:49:45,518
lf you've done anything to my partner,
Doctor, that is a violation of...

1342
01:49:45,618 --> 01:49:47,984
Focus, Andrew! What do you see?

1343
01:49:49,055 --> 01:49:51,523
The names have the same letters.

1344
01:49:52,425 --> 01:49:55,826
Edward Daniels has exactly
the same 13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.

1345
01:49:55,929 --> 01:49:58,124
The same as Rachel Solando
and Dolores Chanal.

1346
01:49:58,231 --> 01:50:00,256
The names are anagrams
for each other.

1347
01:50:00,366 --> 01:50:02,926
Your tactics,
they're not gonna work on me.

1348
01:50:03,036 --> 01:50:05,834
You came here for the truth. Here it is.

1349
01:50:05,939 --> 01:50:07,907
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1350
01:50:08,007 --> 01:50:11,534
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1351
01:50:13,379 --> 01:50:14,346
Bullshit.

1352
01:50:14,447 --> 01:50:16,608
You were committed here by court order
24 months ago.

1353
01:50:16,716 --> 01:50:20,049
Your crime is terrible,
one you can't forgive yourself for,

1354
01:50:20,153 --> 01:50:22,485
so you invented another self.

1355
01:50:24,691 --> 01:50:26,090
All right.

1356
01:50:26,626 --> 01:50:29,254
Let's get down to the facts, all right?

1357
01:50:29,362 --> 01:50:32,229
You've created a story
in which you're not a murderer.

1358
01:50:32,332 --> 01:50:34,357
You're a hero, still a U.S. Marshal,

1359
01:50:34,467 --> 01:50:36,367
only here at Ashecliffe
because of a case,

1360
01:50:36,469 --> 01:50:39,768
and you've uncovered a conspiracy
so that anything we tell you

1361
01:50:39,873 --> 01:50:43,707
about who you are, what you've done,
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1362
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:45,072
My name is Edward Daniels.

1363
01:50:45,178 --> 01:50:49,410
l've been hearing this fantasy for
two years now. l know every detail.

1364
01:50:49,516 --> 01:50:51,450
Patient 67, the storm,

1365
01:50:51,551 --> 01:50:54,748
Rachel Solando, your missing partner,
the dreams you have every night.

1366
01:50:54,854 --> 01:50:57,254
You were at Dachau,
but you may not have killed any guards.

1367
01:51:01,327 --> 01:51:04,956
l wish l could let you just live
in your fantasy world.

1368
01:51:05,064 --> 01:51:06,497
l really do.

1369
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:09,595
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.

1370
01:51:09,702 --> 01:51:11,966
You're the most dangerous patient
we have.

1371
01:51:12,071 --> 01:51:14,335
You've injured orderlies, guards,
other patients.

1372
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:16,374
Two weeks ago,
you attacked George Noyce.

1373
01:51:16,476 --> 01:51:18,706
No, no. l am fucking on to you, Doctor.

1374
01:51:18,811 --> 01:51:20,642
-You had Noyce beaten.
-Of course l didn't!

1375
01:51:20,747 --> 01:51:22,806
Give me one reason
why l would even touch him!

1376
01:51:22,916 --> 01:51:25,282
Because he called you Laeddis,

1377
01:51:25,385 --> 01:51:28,411
and you'd do anything not to be him.

1378
01:51:28,521 --> 01:51:32,082
l have a transcript of the conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1379
01:51:32,192 --> 01:51:36,185
''This is about you, and, Laeddis,
that's all it's ever been about.''

1380
01:51:38,164 --> 01:51:40,632
No, no. He's saying
this is about me and Laeddis.

1381
01:51:40,733 --> 01:51:42,598
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

1382
01:51:42,702 --> 01:51:46,069
he said, now here l'm quoting again,
''You did this.''

1383
01:51:46,172 --> 01:51:48,265
No, no, he meant that it was my fault.

1384
01:51:48,374 --> 01:51:50,342
You almost killed him.

1385
01:51:52,045 --> 01:51:54,809
The warden and the Board of Overseers
are determined something be done.

1386
01:51:54,914 --> 01:51:56,609
lt's been decided

1387
01:51:56,716 --> 01:52:01,312
that unless we can bring you
back to sanity now, right now,

1388
01:52:01,421 --> 01:52:04,822
permanent measures will be taken to
ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1389
01:52:08,328 --> 01:52:11,627
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.
Do you understand?

1390
01:52:15,935 --> 01:52:17,800
Yeah, l understand.

1391
01:52:18,671 --> 01:52:20,866
l understand just fine.

1392
01:52:21,507 --> 01:52:25,568
lf l don't play along
with your little game here,

1393
01:52:25,678 --> 01:52:28,772
Dr. Naehring's gonna turn me
into one of his ghosts.

1394
01:52:29,282 --> 01:52:30,647
But what about my partner?

1395
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:35,153
You gonna tell the U.S. Marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1396
01:52:37,090 --> 01:52:38,523
Hello, boss.

1397
01:52:55,408 --> 01:52:58,138
What the fuck is going on here?

1398
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:04,641
You working for him?

1399
01:53:05,518 --> 01:53:07,008
l'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.

1400
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,987
Someone had to stick with you,
keep you safe.

1401
01:53:12,925 --> 01:53:14,984
You been watching me, huh?

1402
01:53:15,995 --> 01:53:18,020
Watching me every minute.

1403
01:53:18,998 --> 01:53:21,967
Who are you? Who are you? Tell me.

1404
01:53:22,802 --> 01:53:24,770
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1405
01:53:26,205 --> 01:53:29,902
l've been your primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1406
01:53:30,510 --> 01:53:32,341
l'm Lester Sheehan.

1407
01:53:38,851 --> 01:53:41,479
-l told you... l told you about my wife, l...
-l know.

1408
01:53:41,587 --> 01:53:44,818
l climbed down a cliff to get you.
l trusted you.

1409
01:53:44,924 --> 01:53:48,553
l risked everything to come
in here after you. Everything!

1410
01:53:48,661 --> 01:53:49,685
l know, boss.

1411
01:53:49,796 --> 01:53:52,526
We're running out of time here, Andrew.

1412
01:53:52,965 --> 01:53:54,489
l swore before the Board of Overseers

1413
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:58,502
that l could construct the most radical,
cutting-edge role-play

1414
01:53:58,604 --> 01:54:00,868
ever attempted in psychiatry,
and it would bring you back.

1415
01:54:00,973 --> 01:54:03,965
l thought that if we let you play this out

1416
01:54:04,077 --> 01:54:07,672
we could get you to see
how untrue, how impossible it is.

1417
01:54:08,781 --> 01:54:11,249
You've had the run of the place
for two days.

1418
01:54:11,351 --> 01:54:14,616
Tell me, where are
the Nazi experiments?

1419
01:54:14,721 --> 01:54:16,484
The satanic ORs?

1420
01:54:30,136 --> 01:54:32,001
Andrew, listen to me.

1421
01:54:34,407 --> 01:54:36,637
lf we fail with you,

1422
01:54:36,743 --> 01:54:40,611
then everything that we've tried to do
here will be discredited. Everything.

1423
01:54:42,782 --> 01:54:45,910
We're on the front lines
of a war here, old boy.

1424
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:49,552
And right now, it all comes down to you.

1425
01:54:56,496 --> 01:54:59,192
-Don't move! Don't move!
-Andrew! Andrew! No. No.

1426
01:54:59,298 --> 01:55:02,495
My name is Edward Daniels!

1427
01:55:02,602 --> 01:55:04,627
This one's loaded.
l can tell by the weight.

1428
01:55:04,737 --> 01:55:07,297
l see. And that's your firearm, Marshal?
You're sure?

1429
01:55:07,407 --> 01:55:08,567
My initials are on the side.

1430
01:55:08,674 --> 01:55:10,972
There's a dent in the barrel
from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1431
01:55:11,077 --> 01:55:13,170
You're not gonna fuck with my mind
on this one, Doctor!

1432
01:55:13,279 --> 01:55:14,303
Then blast away.

1433
01:55:14,414 --> 01:55:17,713
Because that's the only way
you're ever getting off this island.

1434
01:55:23,823 --> 01:55:25,688
Andrew, please don't.

1435
01:55:36,602 --> 01:55:37,864
My gun.

1436
01:55:44,477 --> 01:55:47,002
What did you do to my goddamn gun?

1437
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:48,606
lt's a toy, Andrew.

1438
01:55:52,151 --> 01:55:54,210
We're telling you the truth.

1439
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:57,951
Dolores was insane,
manic-depressive, suicidal.

1440
01:55:58,658 --> 01:56:01,718
You drank, stayed away,
ignored what everyone told you.

1441
01:56:01,828 --> 01:56:02,920
You moved to that lake house

1442
01:56:03,029 --> 01:56:06,157
after she purposely set
your city apartment on fire.

1443
01:56:06,265 --> 01:56:07,527
-You were...
-You're lying.

1444
01:56:07,633 --> 01:56:11,069
-Andrew! Andrew, stop. No.
-You drugged the cigarettes!

1445
01:56:11,170 --> 01:56:13,001
-All you've done is lie!
-Andrew. Andrew.

1446
01:56:13,105 --> 01:56:16,268
Your children. Andrew, your children.

1447
01:56:16,375 --> 01:56:19,003
Simon. Henry.

1448
01:56:19,412 --> 01:56:20,709
l never had any children.

1449
01:56:20,813 --> 01:56:24,806
Your wife drowned them
at the cabin by the lake.

1450
01:56:24,917 --> 01:56:28,114
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

1451
01:56:28,855 --> 01:56:30,482
every night.

1452
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:31,750
l never had a little girl.

1453
01:56:31,858 --> 01:56:35,419
The one who tells you over and over
that you should have saved her,

1454
01:56:35,528 --> 01:56:37,428
saved them all.

1455
01:56:37,530 --> 01:56:39,964
Your daughter, her name was Rachel.

1456
01:56:40,066 --> 01:56:42,933
Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1457
01:56:43,703 --> 01:56:45,398
Andrew, are you?

1458
01:57:08,427 --> 01:57:10,486
l'm so sorry, baby.

1459
01:57:14,901 --> 01:57:17,233
l told you not to come in here.

1460
01:57:17,737 --> 01:57:21,673
l told you this would be the end of you.

1461
01:57:42,061 --> 01:57:43,358
l'm back!

1462
01:57:43,996 --> 01:57:46,726
We got him just outside of Oklahoma.

1463
01:57:46,832 --> 01:57:49,357
Must've stopped 10 places
in between here and Tulsa.

1464
01:57:49,468 --> 01:57:51,527
l could sleep for a week.

1465
01:57:55,508 --> 01:57:56,805
Dolores?

1466
01:58:03,749 --> 01:58:05,046
Dolores?

1467
01:58:09,889 --> 01:58:12,153
<i>And he said, "Take up your bed</i>
<i>and walk." But God?</i>

1468
01:58:12,258 --> 01:58:13,282
Dolores?

1469
01:58:13,392 --> 01:58:17,419
<i>Then he said, "Take up your bed</i>
<i>and walk." Forgive sins, but God?</i>

1470
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:29,071
Dolores?

1471
01:58:54,433 --> 01:58:55,627
Baby,

1472
01:58:57,703 --> 01:58:59,534
why are you all wet?

1473
01:59:01,907 --> 01:59:03,431
l missed you.

1474
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:12,477
l wanna go home.

1475
01:59:15,655 --> 01:59:17,122
You are home.

1476
01:59:22,328 --> 01:59:24,125
Where are the kids?

1477
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:29,929
They're in school.

1478
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:36,108
lt's Saturday, honey.

1479
01:59:37,309 --> 01:59:39,470
School's not in on Saturday.

1480
01:59:42,148 --> 01:59:43,706
My school is.

1481
01:59:57,096 --> 01:59:58,586
Oh, my God.

1482
02:00:00,933 --> 02:00:02,366
Oh, my God!

1483
02:00:15,548 --> 02:00:18,210
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1484
02:00:22,421 --> 02:00:23,979
Oh, my God, no.

1485
02:00:28,461 --> 02:00:30,156
Come on, come on.

1486
02:00:43,409 --> 02:00:46,503
No. No. Please, God.

1487
02:00:48,547 --> 02:00:52,278
Please, God, no! No!

1488
02:00:55,521 --> 02:00:56,613
No.

1489
02:01:02,161 --> 02:01:03,253
No.

1490
02:01:05,798 --> 02:01:06,992
No.

1491
02:01:51,410 --> 02:01:52,604
Baby.

1492
02:02:11,430 --> 02:02:13,921
Let's put them at the table, Andrew.

1493
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:17,963
We'll dry them off.
We'll change their clothes.

1494
02:02:20,172 --> 02:02:22,265
They'll be our living dolls.

1495
02:02:26,612 --> 02:02:29,342
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1496
02:02:34,386 --> 02:02:38,846
lf you ever loved me, Dolores,
please stop talking.

1497
02:02:45,497 --> 02:02:46,930
l love you.

1498
02:02:55,708 --> 02:02:57,232
Set me free.

1499
02:03:01,947 --> 02:03:03,346
Oh, baby.

1500
02:03:06,819 --> 02:03:08,719
We'll give them baths.

1501
02:03:11,991 --> 02:03:15,188
-l love you, baby.
-l love you, too.

1502
02:03:15,294 --> 02:03:17,091
-l love you so much.
-l love you so much.

1503
02:03:17,196 --> 02:03:18,891
l love you. l...

1504
02:03:42,788 --> 02:03:44,517
Oh, baby.

1505
02:03:50,496 --> 02:03:51,793
Andrew.

1506
02:03:53,866 --> 02:03:55,857
Andrew, can you hear me?

1507
02:03:56,168 --> 02:03:57,465
Rachel.

1508
02:03:58,404 --> 02:03:59,996
Rachel, Rachel.

1509
02:04:02,308 --> 02:04:03,570
Rachel?

1510
02:04:06,111 --> 02:04:07,510
Rachel who?

1511
02:04:10,449 --> 02:04:12,474
Rachel. Rachel Laeddis.

1512
02:04:13,686 --> 02:04:15,415
My daughter.

1513
02:04:19,024 --> 02:04:20,753
Why are you here?

1514
02:04:23,996 --> 02:04:25,520
Because l killed my wife.

1515
02:04:25,631 --> 02:04:27,690
And why did you do that?

1516
02:04:31,236 --> 02:04:34,364
Because she murdered our children,

1517
02:04:37,343 --> 02:04:38,708
and she told me to let her go.

1518
02:04:42,948 --> 02:04:46,042
-Who's Teddy Daniels?
-He doesn't exist.

1519
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:50,888
Neither does Rachel Solando.
l made them up.

1520
02:04:50,990 --> 02:04:52,157
Why?

1521
02:04:53,559 --> 02:04:55,686
We need to hear you say it.

1522
02:05:01,533 --> 02:05:04,696
After she tried to kill herself
the first time,

1523
02:05:06,805 --> 02:05:08,705
Dolores told me she...

1524
02:05:09,708 --> 02:05:13,906
She had an insect living
inside her brain.

1525
02:05:15,981 --> 02:05:20,645
She could feel it
clicking across her skull,

1526
02:05:20,753 --> 02:05:24,917
just pulling the wires just for fun.

1527
02:05:28,660 --> 02:05:30,389
She told me that.

1528
02:05:31,897 --> 02:05:34,695
She told me that, but l didn't listen.

1529
02:05:38,437 --> 02:05:40,701
l loved her so much, you know.

1530
02:05:42,174 --> 02:05:44,267
Why did you make them up?

1531
02:05:46,412 --> 02:05:50,314
Because l can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1532
02:05:54,186 --> 02:05:55,448
And l...

1533
02:05:58,023 --> 02:06:02,460
l killed them 'cause l didn't get her help,
you know.

1534
02:06:06,732 --> 02:06:08,290
l killed them.

1535
02:06:13,138 --> 02:06:14,264
Here's my fear, Andrew.

1536
02:06:14,373 --> 02:06:17,536
We broke through once before,
nine months ago,

1537
02:06:17,643 --> 02:06:18,610
and then you regressed.

1538
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:24,513
-l don't remember that.
-l know.

1539
02:06:26,051 --> 02:06:27,780
You reset, Andrew.

1540
02:06:28,287 --> 02:06:32,314
Like a tape playing over and over
on an endless loop.

1541
02:06:33,625 --> 02:06:35,058
l hope that what we've done here
will be enough

1542
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:38,254
to stop it from ever happening again,

1543
02:06:38,363 --> 02:06:41,855
but l need to know
you've accepted reality.

1544
02:06:48,373 --> 02:06:51,103
You came after me, huh, Doctor?

1545
02:06:53,011 --> 02:06:56,845
You tried to help me
when no one else would.

1546
02:07:08,694 --> 02:07:11,561
My name's Andrew Laeddis,

1547
02:07:18,570 --> 02:07:22,006
and l murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1548
02:07:46,798 --> 02:07:50,234
-How we doing this morning?
-Good.

1549
02:07:50,335 --> 02:07:53,202
-And you?
-Can't complain.

1550
02:08:02,915 --> 02:08:06,851
-So what's our next move?
-You tell me.

1551
02:08:12,491 --> 02:08:16,757
We gotta get off this rock, Chuck.
Get back to the mainland.

1552
02:08:16,862 --> 02:08:19,797
Whatever the hell's going on here,
it's bad.

1553
02:08:41,753 --> 02:08:44,916
Don't worry, partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

1554
02:08:50,529 --> 02:08:53,293
That's right. We're too smart for them.

1555
02:08:54,466 --> 02:08:56,559
Yeah, we are, aren't we?

1556
02:09:12,251 --> 02:09:14,947
You know,
this place makes me wonder...

1557
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,579
Yeah, what's that, boss?

1558
02:09:18,590 --> 02:09:20,490
Which would be worse,

1559
02:09:21,393 --> 02:09:25,454
to live as a monster
or to die as a good man?

1560
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:36,602
Teddy?
