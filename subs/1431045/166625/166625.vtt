1
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:06,017
Verheiden!

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,920
No!

3
00:00:27,544 --> 00:00:32,004
You want a piece of me?
You ugly son of a bitch!

4
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,350
Oh, God.

5
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:11,744
Weyland.

6
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,155
- You OK?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

7
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:19,921
Leave it. They can only slow us down.

8
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:24,024
Too much has been lost
to leave here with nothing.

9
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,228
Give it to me.

10
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,916
Max.

11
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,423
Hold on.

12
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:55,624
Look out!

13
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,225
Come on. We have to get Weyland.

14
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,998
Weyland, come on.

15
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,461
- What were they?
- You're the expert.

16
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,504
l've got to stop. l've got to stop.

17
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:34,241
Take it easy. Weyland.

18
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,938
Look at me.

19
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:38,640
You have to slow your breathing down.

20
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:41,149
Slow, steady breaths.

21
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:49,122
- Weyland, come on.
- l can hardly stand.

22
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:51,524
l'm not gonna let you die down here.

23
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:54,120
You didn't.

24
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:58,224
- There's another one. We have to go. Now!
- Weyland.

25
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:01,202
- Come with us.
- Get her outta here.

26
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:03,831
- Now!
- Come on.

27
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:06,501
Run!

28
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:36,997
Don't turn your back on me.

29
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,298
Wait.

30
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,335
This way.

31
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:25,211
Go! Go!

32
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:46,827
Look over here.

33
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,928
- He's marking himself.
- What?

34
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:22,665
Ancient warriors would mark themselves
with the blood of their kill.

35
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:25,003
lt's a rite of passage.

36
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:32,343
This is starting to make sense.

37
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:45,187
The hieroglyphs are
a little difficult to make out.

38
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:48,059
But the story is all here.

39
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:57,398
Thousands of years ago,
these hunters found a backwater planet.

40
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:09,852
They taught humans how to build
and were worshipped as gods.

41
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,258
Every hundred years the gods would return.

42
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,492
And when they did,
they would expect a sacrifice.

43
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:29,797
Humans were used to breed the ultimate prey.

44
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:41,840
The hunters would battle
with these great serpents

45
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:45,752
to prove themselves worthy
to carry the mark.

46
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,997
But if the hunters lost,

47
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:08,009
they made sure nothing survived.

48
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:16,508
An entire civilization wiped out overnight.

49
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,554
So...

50
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:27,062
the humanoids, the hunters -
they brought those creatures here to hunt?

51
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,223
And they use us like cattle.

52
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:33,068
We're hosts for them to breed in.

53
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:36,572
The heat bloom was the sign
to lure us down here.

54
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,506
This whole thing was a trap.

55
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,140
Without us, there could be no hunt.

56
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:13,833
Shit!

57
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,969
Verheiden!

58
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,015
Oh, shit.

59
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:06,258
When that door opens, we're dead.

60
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:09,355
- Not if we set things right.
- What do you mean?

61
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,560
This pyramid is like a prison.

62
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:17,402
We took the guards' guns,
and now the prisoners are running free.

63
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:20,965
To restore order, the guards need their guns.

64
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:27,673
When that door opens,
we're gonna give that thing his gun back.

65
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,551
Are you crazy? During a big-game hunt, the
animals being hunted don't arm the hunters.

66
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,149
They're not hunting us.
We're in the middle of a war.

67
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:39,888
- lt's time to pick a side.
- We are on our side.

68
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:46,768
We have to consider the possibility
that we might not make it out of here.

69
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:52,399
But we have to make sure
those serpents don't reach the surface.

70
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:55,442
Because if they do,

71
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,570
everything everywhere could die.

72
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:04,577
The enemy of my enemy...

73
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,814
is my friend.

74
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,340
Let's go find our friend.

75
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,957
How do you say ''scared shitless'' in ltalian?

76
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:51,056
<i>Non vedo l'ora di uscire con te da questa
piramide perche mi sto cagando addosso.</i>

77
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:53,534
More or less.

78
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,050
Move!

79
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,177
Lex.

80
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:45,820
Lex.

81
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,446
Hold on.

82
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,687
Come on, Lex.

83
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,194
Oh, no.

84
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:55,049
Wait. Wait. Please, wait.

85
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,252
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

86
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,160
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

87
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:12,420
l'm coming with you.
You hear me, you ugly creature?

88
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:01,331
What are you doing?

89
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,093
Miller!

90
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:23,544
Miller!

91
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,093
Sebastian.

92
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:18,865
- Help me, Lex.
- l'm gonna get you out of there.

93
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,665
- lt's too late. lt's inside me.
- l'm gonna get you outta here.

94
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:25,002
- You can't...
- No!

95
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:28,043
No. No. No! No!

96
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,203
l have to help him.

97
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,279
Lex!

98
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,875
They mustn't reach the surface.

99
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:41,188
They mustn't reach the surface.

100
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:43,781
l know.

101
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:53,827
Do it!

102
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:59,532
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

103
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:21,820
lt's a bomb.

104
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,154
Well, l hope it kills every fucking one of 'em.

105
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:12,797
You are one ugly mother...

106
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,331
Got it!
