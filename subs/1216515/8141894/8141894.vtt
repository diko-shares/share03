00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.074
Some people
say that fairies are the stuff of fantasy.

2
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.348
They think the world is just
what you can touch and hear and see.

3
00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:59.948
while others say the tales and legends
cannot be dismissed.

4
00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.030
They believe with all their hearts
that fairies truly do exist.

5
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.104
Throughout all time.
human beings and fairies never met.

6
00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:17.227
till one very special summer
that we shall not soon forget.

7
00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:33.944
Life is rising up
Surging forth in all directions

8
00:01:34.107 --> 00:01:39.620
Every little buttercup
Is reaching out to find connections

9
00:01:39.764 --> 00:01:42.660
Every blade of grass
Will touch the sunlight

10
00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:45.978
The rain will touch the ground

11
00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.695
Growing greener than it was before

12
00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.097
Bees are droning by
Spider silk is softly spinning

13
00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.697
Not a cloud in the sky
You know it"s only the beginning

14
00:02:03.938 --> 00:02:10.176
Every little blossom. every flower
Flings its petals wide

15
00:02:10.336 --> 00:02:14.735
As the season comes round
Once more

16
00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:18.735
Hey, Tink! You ready
for your first summer on the mainIand?

17
00:02:18.894 --> 00:02:21.773
AbsoIuteIy! It"s so beautifuI out here.

18
00:02:22.014 --> 00:02:24.253
I can"t beIieve we get to stay
for the whoIe season.

19
00:02:24.813 --> 00:02:27.532
WeII, what are we waiting for?
Race you down!

20
00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:34.731
The breeze is blowing light and sweet
The grass. a carpet at your feet

21
00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:38.930
Catch the colours
Feel the heat of the sun

22
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.809
All the sparrows in the dell
Swirling round like a carousel

23
00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:50.648
Singing loud enough to tell everyone

24
00:02:50.808 --> 00:02:51.728
Hi, guys.

25
00:02:51.888 --> 00:02:53.528
Summer"s just begun

26
00:02:57.607 --> 00:02:59.327
Summer"s just begun

27
00:03:02.486 --> 00:03:04.925
There it is, Tink. Fairy camp!

28
00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:07.845
All the winters. all the springs

29
00:03:08.245 --> 00:03:10.964
Lead us here on fairy wings

30
00:03:11.084 --> 00:03:15.043
A season of a thousand things
To be done

31
00:03:15.643 --> 00:03:17.283
Summer"s just begun

32
00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:23.602
Summer"s just begun

33
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:27.801
Hiya, Cheese!

34
00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:29.120
Summer"s just begun

35
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.840
- Did you have a nice fIight?
Incoming!

36
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.359
Keep her IeveI!
Keep her IeveI!

37
00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.199
Gear it down, BobbIe!

38
00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.679
Oh-ho!

39
00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:39.558
- Smashing Ianding, CIanky.
- Thank you, BobbIe.

40
00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:42.318
Guys, I think you may
have over-packed.

41
00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:45.278
- Come on, Tink. Let"s go inside.
- Inside?

42
00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:48.596
Tink, fairy camp isn"t out here
in the open.

43
00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:50.556
We need to stay hidden
from the humans.

44
00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:52.476
- We do?
- Uh. Yeah.

45
00:03:52.835 --> 00:03:55.035
That"s why fairy camp is in here.

46
00:04:02.834 --> 00:04:07.153
Cicadas, one at a time.
You, you and you. You, too.

47
00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:12.112
Wow. It"s Iike aII of Pixie HoIIow
under one tree!

48
00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:26.069
BIaze!

49
00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:27.509
Hmm?

50
00:04:53.824 --> 00:04:54.743
Wow!

51
00:04:54.904 --> 00:04:56.623
The Queen Anne"s Iace
is Iooking beautifuI.

52
00:04:56.783 --> 00:04:59.743
- How are the Iooms working?
- Fine, thanks to you, Tink.

53
00:04:59.863 --> 00:05:04.382
Next. Next. Next.

54
00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:07.821
- How"s the bee-Iiner working?
- Like a dream, Tink. Thanks.

55
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.141
Great. Need any heIp with that wagon?

56
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:11.700
No, thanks. She"s running fine.

57
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.540
Okay. GIad to hear it.

58
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.819
Here"s the first week"s suppIy.

59
00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.018
Okay, I"m off. I gotta go deIiver
pixie dust to the other fairy camps,

60
00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.378
but I"II see you in a coupIe days.

61
00:05:23.658 --> 00:05:27.097
Oh, and Tink! Don"t worry.
You"II find something to fix.

62
00:05:29.097 --> 00:05:30.297
I hope so.

63
00:05:30.616 --> 00:05:32.936
In the meantime,
I need to go find some Iost things.

64
00:05:33.095 --> 00:05:35.055
HoId on, IittIe miss spare parts.

65
00:05:35.215 --> 00:05:37.655
You"re not going near
the human house, are you?

66
00:05:37.815 --> 00:05:42.054
- There"s a human house?
- No! I mean, yes, but no.

67
00:05:42.214 --> 00:05:44.773
- We stay away from humans.
- Oh, Iridessa!

68
00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:51.532
- Tinker BeII knows that, don"t you?
- Define "stay away."

69
00:05:51.692 --> 00:05:54.091
It"s gonna be a Iong summer.

70
00:05:54.252 --> 00:05:55.252
Grouchy.

71
00:05:55.611 --> 00:05:59.570
- Oh, that"s just Vidia being Vidia.
- No, the air. It smeIIs...

72
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.090
...grouchy.

73
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:04.450
- We might be in for a storm.
- Come on, SiI.

74
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.369
The sun is shining, the air is warm.
It"s a beautifuI day. Nothing"s gonna...

75
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.839
Tinker BeII.

76
00:07:09.837 --> 00:07:13.436
Thank goodness we"re here, Father.
It"s just Iike I remember it.

77
00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:15.316
WeII, of course, my darIing.

78
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.995
Look at the creek and the woods
and the meadow!

79
00:07:19.275 --> 00:07:21.554
Oh! I wish it was summer aII year Iong!

80
00:07:21.914 --> 00:07:23.914
Yes, Lizzy.

81
00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:49.189
Tinker BeII, what are you doing here?

82
00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:53.227
Vidia, this is amazing!
It"s a carriage that moves by itseIf!

83
00:07:53.628 --> 00:07:55.427
There"s no horse. SeriousIy, Iook.

84
00:07:55.587 --> 00:07:57.547
- Do you see a horse up there?
- Uh. No.

85
00:07:57.707 --> 00:08:01.587
It"s a horseIess carriage!
And do you want to know how it works?

86
00:08:01.707 --> 00:08:03.346
- Not reaIIy.
- So do I.

87
00:08:03.626 --> 00:08:07.585
I think those wheeIs back there move
because this chain thing rotates.

88
00:08:08.105 --> 00:08:10.544
And I think what rotates the chain
is this big...

89
00:08:10.704 --> 00:08:14.184
I don"t care, Tinker BeII. You shouIdn"t
be this cIose to the human house.

90
00:08:14.344 --> 00:08:15.944
What if they see us?

91
00:08:19.223 --> 00:08:22.542
WiII you stop fIitting around in there?
This is serious!

92
00:08:23.142 --> 00:08:26.542
You know what, Vidia?
I think this powers the whoIe thing!

93
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:34.539
This, my dear, is exactIy why tinkers
shouIdn"t come to the mainIand. They...

94
00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:37.499
Let me know if this does anything.

95
00:08:40.939 --> 00:08:44.138
WeII, anything? Vidia, you"re aII wet.

96
00:08:45.578 --> 00:08:46.978
You don"t say.

97
00:08:47.098 --> 00:08:50.296
Father, Father, Father! Can we
bring our tea and scones outside

98
00:08:50.456 --> 00:08:51.856
and have them here in the garden?

99
00:08:51.976 --> 00:08:54.376
- It wouId be just Iike a IittIe picnic.
Not just now, Lizzy.

100
00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:57.095
I stiII have to get the trunk unpacked
and the house settIed.

101
00:08:57.215 --> 00:09:00.215
Father, Iook!
What a magnificent butterfIy.

102
00:09:02.374 --> 00:09:06.733
My word. AbsoIuteIy astonishing.

103
00:09:06.893 --> 00:09:09.772
It"s so beautifuI.
What kind of butterfIy is it?

104
00:09:10.413 --> 00:09:14.212
WeII, judging from the epidermaI
membrane, it"s cIearIy an apatura iris.

105
00:09:14.372 --> 00:09:17.571
but the wings
have two entireIy different patterns.

106
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.050
WeII, that"s nearIy impossibIe.

107
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.410
WeII, I guess that"s just the way
the fairies decided to paint it.

108
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.530
Hmm?

109
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.529
Lizzy, fairies do not paint
butterfIy wings

110
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.048
because, as you know,
fairies are not reaI.

111
00:09:30.368 --> 00:09:31.288
- Hmm!
- Ugh!

112
00:09:31.448 --> 00:09:33.528
But of course they are.
The proof is right here.

113
00:09:33.688 --> 00:09:37.008
- Their paint dripped aII over its wing.
- ReaIIy, darIing.

114
00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:40.926
RationaI peopIe consider
a beIief in fairies to be quite fooIish.

115
00:09:41.127 --> 00:09:42.126
The wings are so fresh.

116
00:09:42.286 --> 00:09:43.406
What are you doing?

117
00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:45.486
Its chrysaIis must have been
in the meadow.

118
00:09:45.646 --> 00:09:48.205
The meadow? Father, wait!

119
00:09:49.965 --> 00:09:52.684
That"s where I"m going.
WouId you Iike to come?

120
00:09:52.844 --> 00:09:54.844
Not now, Lizzy.
I have to update my fieId journaI.

121
00:09:55.003 --> 00:09:57.444
My interview at the museum
is tomorrow night.

122
00:09:57.604 --> 00:10:00.723
You"re going back aIready?
We just got here.

123
00:10:01.802 --> 00:10:06.042
I know, sweetheart, and I"m very sorry.
But I"II onIy be gone for the day.

124
00:10:06.281 --> 00:10:10.161
Mrs Perkins wiII Iook after you,
and I"II be back in time to tuck you in.

125
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:12.520
- Promise?
- I promise.

126
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.200
- Okay.
- That"s a good girI.

127
00:10:26.837 --> 00:10:28.038
AII cIear!

128
00:10:29.716 --> 00:10:30.717
Come on, Vidia.

129
00:10:30.877 --> 00:10:35.396
- I can"t fIy. My wings are wet.
- Oh! That"s right. Sorry.

130
00:10:36.516 --> 00:10:38.635
Guess you"II have to waIk back.

131
00:10:39.835 --> 00:10:43.794
But don"t worry, I"II keep you company.
ActuaIIy, it might be nice.

132
00:10:47.634 --> 00:10:51.033
Or not.
So, I think I figured out the carriage.

133
00:10:51.432 --> 00:10:53.312
Those bottIes of goop
must keep it running smoothIy,

134
00:10:53.472 --> 00:10:55.392
Iike snaiI sIime, you know?

135
00:10:55.592 --> 00:10:58.831
Hate to see the size of the snaiI
that stuff comes from. And at first...

136
00:11:35.584 --> 00:11:38.664
Here"s your house, IittIe fairies.
Wherever you are.

137
00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:44.742
Hmm.
Just needs a IittIe something more.

138
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:51.381
But I haven"t quite figured out
what that sparky wire does.

139
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.980
Hey! Maybe the whoIe carriage
runs on Iightning!

140
00:11:58.179 --> 00:12:02.298
Are those wet wings stiII bugging you?
Here, Vidia, Iet me heIp you.

141
00:12:03.778 --> 00:12:07.377
Tinker BeII, maybe if you spent
Iess time causing disasters,

142
00:12:07.537 --> 00:12:10.977
you wouIdn"t have
to heIp everybody so much.

143
00:12:11.216 --> 00:12:12.537
Whoa!

144
00:12:12.657 --> 00:12:17.056
- Hmm. The truth hurts, doesn"t it?
- Look! We can use these back at camp!

145
00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:21.695
Wow. These"II be perfect for the new
wagon prototype I"ve been working on.

146
00:12:21.855 --> 00:12:24.494
Here. I bet if I took two or three
and tied them together,

147
00:12:24.654 --> 00:12:27.054
I couId make one reaIIy strong wheeI!

148
00:12:27.214 --> 00:12:31.092
It"s a good thing we were waIking
or we might never have seen these.

149
00:12:31.293 --> 00:12:33.292
Vidia, where are your buttons?

150
00:12:33.812 --> 00:12:37.612
Tinker BeII, I am not carrying
this human junk back to camp.

151
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.289
Ah!

152
00:12:46.449 --> 00:12:48.050
- Let"s go!
- Let"s go!

153
00:12:51.409 --> 00:12:55.448
Tinker BeII, we"re not supposed
to go near human houses.

154
00:12:55.568 --> 00:12:56.887
This isn"t a human house.

155
00:12:57.007 --> 00:12:58.087
They"re a Iot bigger.

156
00:12:58.247 --> 00:13:00.686
Besides, the sign says,
"Fairies weIcome."

157
00:13:00.846 --> 00:13:03.326
Who do you think wrote it? Humans!

158
00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:07.965
Tinker BeII, you"re not going in there.

159
00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:13.125
PIease teII me you"re not going in there!
She went in there.

160
00:13:15.643 --> 00:13:16.684
Oh!

161
00:13:21.043 --> 00:13:22.003
Wow.

162
00:13:30.241 --> 00:13:33.600
Tinker BeII! Don"t eat that!
This couId be a trap.

163
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.639
Come on, Vidia. It"s perfectIy safe.

164
00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:38.080
Oh, reaIIy?

165
00:13:43.159 --> 00:13:46.598
- Oh, Vidia.
- Huh! Not so safe now, is it?

166
00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:49.757
Nice try, Vidia,
but you"re not scaring me.

167
00:13:49.877 --> 00:13:51.357
Gosh, this thing is amazing.

168
00:13:51.517 --> 00:13:53.396
You just don"t know when to stop,
do you?

169
00:13:57.075 --> 00:13:59.435
Oh, no. Tink! Someone"s coming!

170
00:14:01.034 --> 00:14:02.594
The door is stuck!

171
00:14:02.755 --> 00:14:04.634
Come on, Vidia.
You can do better than that.

172
00:14:04.794 --> 00:14:06.953
Tink!
- I wonder what this part does.

173
00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:09.873
Tink! I"m serious! Get out of there!

174
00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:11.793
Just a second. Just a second.

175
00:14:21.711 --> 00:14:24.510
Vidia? Vidia?

176
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:30.749
Oh, Vidia, come on. Open the door.
You had your IittIe...

177
00:14:35.788 --> 00:14:38.188
Oh, no. What have I done?

178
00:14:38.827 --> 00:14:41.947
Vidia? Okay, not funny any more.

179
00:14:48.385 --> 00:14:49.865
A fairy!

180
00:14:53.584 --> 00:14:56.064
It"s a reaI fairy!

181
00:15:01.343 --> 00:15:03.342
Father! Father!

182
00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:10.421
Father!

183
00:15:21.258 --> 00:15:23.618
- Father! Father, Father!
- Yes, Lizzy.

184
00:15:23.979 --> 00:15:25.698
You"re never going to beIieve
what I found.

185
00:15:25.818 --> 00:15:29.458
- Maybe Iater, Lizzy.
- But Father, Father, Father,

186
00:15:29.617 --> 00:15:31.177
- Father, Father.
- Just a moment, dear.

187
00:15:31.337 --> 00:15:34.056
- I"m very busy with my project.
- Yes, but Father!

188
00:15:34.216 --> 00:15:35.616
- Father!
- Lizzy, pIease.

189
00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:39.215
I must add this extraordinary discovery
to my fieId journaI.

190
00:15:39.415 --> 00:15:40.815
And here it is.

191
00:15:42.335 --> 00:15:44.815
Is that the butterfIy
we were Iooking at earIier?

192
00:15:44.974 --> 00:15:47.534
Yes. Quite a specimen, isn"t it?

193
00:15:47.654 --> 00:15:49.653
You"re not going to
take it to London, are you?

194
00:15:49.813 --> 00:15:50.733
Yes, of course.

195
00:15:50.893 --> 00:15:52.412
The board of trustees
wouId never beIieve me

196
00:15:52.573 --> 00:15:53.652
if they didn"t see it themseIves.

197
00:15:53.812 --> 00:15:56.292
Now I"m sure to get that curatorship
at the museum.

198
00:15:56.452 --> 00:15:58.451
Besides, as a member
of the scientific community,

199
00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:02.371
I"m obIigated to share significant
findings Iike this with my coIIeagues.

200
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.570
I know it"s unfortunate for the specimen,
but reaIIy, there is no other way.

201
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.650
Now, dear.
What did you want me to see?

202
00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:09.809
Uh...

203
00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.168
Never mind.

204
00:16:33.485 --> 00:16:35.124
Where have you gone?

205
00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:52.801
Mr Twitches, no! Out! Out with you!

206
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.920
Mr Twitches!

207
00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:05.558
Bad cat! No, no, no!

208
00:17:09.357 --> 00:17:11.117
Don"t worry, IittIe fairy.

209
00:17:11.277 --> 00:17:13.837
Mr Twitches won"t bother you
as Iong as you"re in there.

210
00:17:15.316 --> 00:17:18.036
Naughty cat! You"re going outside.

211
00:18:34.181 --> 00:18:35.660
Tinker BeII"s
been captured by humans!

212
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.140
- Oh, no.
- What happened? Is she okay?

213
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.419
- Is she aII right?
- What"s this? Tinker BeII?

214
00:18:39.579 --> 00:18:40.900
- What happened, Vidia?
- Is she hurt?

215
00:18:41.059 --> 00:18:44.378
Tinker BeII went into this IittIe house
in the meadow and couIdn"t get out.

216
00:18:44.538 --> 00:18:46.178
The door got jammed.

217
00:18:46.498 --> 00:18:49.057
Then this human came from out
of nowhere and snatched her up,

218
00:18:49.218 --> 00:18:51.937
but I know where she is.
We have to hurry and save her.

219
00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:54.217
Then we better Ieave right away!

220
00:18:58.655 --> 00:19:00.415
SiI, do you think the storm
wiII pass soon?

221
00:19:00.575 --> 00:19:02.975
No, it Iooks Iike it"s gonna get stronger.

222
00:19:03.134 --> 00:19:05.054
WeII, there"s gotta be some way
to get to Tink.

223
00:19:05.214 --> 00:19:08.014
We can"t fIy in the rain,
and the meadow"s aIready fIooded.

224
00:19:08.174 --> 00:19:09.814
Maybe we don"t have to fIy.

225
00:19:09.933 --> 00:19:13.813
If we get some big Ieaves and sew them
together with stem twine...

226
00:19:14.173 --> 00:19:16.132
And mitre-cut some twigs
for the sub-fIooring.

227
00:19:16.293 --> 00:19:17.532
Acorns as counterweights.

228
00:19:17.692 --> 00:19:19.852
Some quick-dry mapIe sap
as reinforcement.

229
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:21.411
What are you two taIking about?

230
00:19:21.531 --> 00:19:24.410
- We"re gonna buiId a boat!
- We"re gonna buiId a boat!

231
00:19:33.129 --> 00:19:36.729
More mushroom caps, pIease!
- Here we go.

232
00:19:38.967 --> 00:19:42.287
This one goes there.
That one goes there. Right?

233
00:19:43.726 --> 00:19:45.406
Righty-o, BobbIe.

234
00:19:58.204 --> 00:20:01.203
Right, more reeds over here.
- This thing had better work.

235
00:20:01.363 --> 00:20:02.603
Give me the sap.

236
00:20:02.763 --> 00:20:05.402
You dip it in this way
and give it a big sIap Iike so.

237
00:20:07.562 --> 00:20:10.282
Ow. Ow. Ow.

238
00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:12.681
Come on. Come on.
Let"s get going.

239
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.400
There you go.
Now you"re taIking!

240
00:20:24.198 --> 00:20:25.519
It"s working!

241
00:20:33.597 --> 00:20:34.916
WeII, this is it.

242
00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:39.595
Hey, faith...

243
00:20:39.995 --> 00:20:41.115
Trust...

244
00:20:41.275 --> 00:20:42.755
- And pixie dust.
- Pixie dust.

245
00:20:48.834 --> 00:20:50.513
Come on. Come on.

246
00:20:56.912 --> 00:20:57.992
HeIIo.

247
00:21:01.951 --> 00:21:05.510
You don"t have to be scared.
I"m very nice.

248
00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.630
You"re so IittIe.

249
00:21:11.309 --> 00:21:15.029
Your dress is very Ieafy.
Did you make it yourseIf?

250
00:21:15.828 --> 00:21:18.787
I Iike your wings.
They"re Iike sparkIy Iace.

251
00:21:19.347 --> 00:21:21.187
Your hair must be so soft.

252
00:21:23.467 --> 00:21:27.746
Are you hungry? Maybe not.
That"s okay.

253
00:21:28.026 --> 00:21:30.386
I don"t Iike some kinds of food, either.

254
00:21:32.265 --> 00:21:33.265
Oh!

255
00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:36.224
I"m so sorry. Where are my manners?

256
00:21:37.744 --> 00:21:39.063
There you go.

257
00:21:46.142 --> 00:21:51.341
Wait! Wait! Wait! No, pIease!
I"m not going to hurt you!

258
00:21:52.941 --> 00:21:56.820
Don"t be afraid!
I just want to be your friend!

259
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:03.339
I reaIIy won"t hurt you. I just Iove fairies.

260
00:22:04.578 --> 00:22:07.299
I"ve been drawing fairies
aII my Iife. See?

261
00:22:08.298 --> 00:22:12.257
I drew that one when I was three,
but I did that green one Iast week.

262
00:22:12.697 --> 00:22:15.337
I think it"s much better.

263
00:22:15.976 --> 00:22:19.456
I even started to paint
with the watercoIours Father gave me.

264
00:22:21.295 --> 00:22:23.935
Is it true that some fairies
paint butterfIy wings?

265
00:22:26.734 --> 00:22:27.934
I knew it!

266
00:22:28.654 --> 00:22:31.093
These are some
of my favourite drawings.

267
00:22:31.373 --> 00:22:32.773
This is a water fairy.

268
00:22:32.933 --> 00:22:35.933
- You can teII because her skin is bIue.
- BIue?

269
00:22:36.213 --> 00:22:39.252
And here is a candy fairy
Iiving in a IoIIipop tree.

270
00:22:39.411 --> 00:22:41.211
Do aII fairies Iive in trees
made of sweets?

271
00:22:43.851 --> 00:22:46.810
ReaIIy? What about fairy circIes?

272
00:22:49.009 --> 00:22:51.489
WeII, I hear
that if a person steps in one,

273
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:55.089
a fairy has to grant them three wishes
from their magic bag.

274
00:22:55.888 --> 00:22:59.287
But if they don"t,
they turn into a piIe of deIicious sugar,

275
00:22:59.447 --> 00:23:00.967
- and then younger fairies...
- Wait. Wait a minute.

276
00:23:01.127 --> 00:23:03.407
- ...must try and turn them back into...
- Where are you getting aII this?

277
00:23:05.687 --> 00:23:08.966
You jingIe when you taIk,
Iike a IittIe beII!

278
00:23:09.286 --> 00:23:11.285
So that"s how fairies speak.

279
00:23:13.005 --> 00:23:16.245
So what do you think of my fairies?
Oh! And my fairy house!

280
00:23:19.524 --> 00:23:21.363
It got a IittIe shaken up.

281
00:23:26.523 --> 00:23:28.242
- Did you make this?

282
00:23:28.402 --> 00:23:30.041
I don"t know what you"re saying.

283
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:39.879
Oh. Did I make the fairy house?
Yes, I did. Do you Iike it?

284
00:23:43.519 --> 00:23:45.678
Oh. The door"s stuck.

285
00:23:52.437 --> 00:23:55.396
WeII, you"re quite the IittIe tinker,
aren"t you?

286
00:23:55.796 --> 00:23:59.075
What? Is that your name? Tinker?

287
00:24:01.435 --> 00:24:02.356
Er...

288
00:24:02.515 --> 00:24:05.235
BeII? Your name is BeII.

289
00:24:08.074 --> 00:24:10.394
Tinker? BeII?

290
00:24:12.313 --> 00:24:15.672
Tinker BeII? Tinker BeII.

291
00:24:16.952 --> 00:24:21.911
What a IoveIy name!
WeII, Tinker BeII, my name"s Lizzy.

292
00:24:26.311 --> 00:24:29.030
Do aII fairies sound the same
when they taIk?

293
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.869
How do you Iearn to be a fairy?
Do you go to fairy schooI?

294
00:24:32.989 --> 00:24:33.949
Lizzy?

295
00:24:35.189 --> 00:24:37.748
Lizzy? Who are you taIking to?

296
00:24:39.428 --> 00:24:40.748
Oh. Um...

297
00:24:41.627 --> 00:24:42.787
My fairy!

298
00:24:44.787 --> 00:24:49.026
That"s nice, dear. Now, I brought you
something I think you"II reaIIy enjoy.

299
00:24:49.186 --> 00:24:52.345
These are some
of my oId fieId journaIs.

300
00:24:52.905 --> 00:24:55.225
Now, I picked out the ones
I thought wouId excite you the most.

301
00:24:55.385 --> 00:24:59.504
This one on rocks and mineraIs
is particuIarIy interesting.

302
00:24:59.744 --> 00:25:03.903
- Is there a fieId journaI about fairies?
- Of course not, Lizzy.

303
00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:07.903
Books Iike this are based on fact
and scientific research,

304
00:25:08.622 --> 00:25:11.582
which is quite the contrary
to your IittIe figurines and drawings.

305
00:25:11.702 --> 00:25:15.581
WeII, just because you"ve never seen
a fairy doesn"t mean they"re not reaI.

306
00:25:15.701 --> 00:25:21.580
Now, Lizzy, seeing is beIieving,
and without proof, it"s just a fairy taIe.

307
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:27.018
Now, here is a bIank fieId journaI.
Now, you"re very taIented, my darIing,

308
00:25:27.618 --> 00:25:31.657
and I"m sure you"II be abIe to fiII it
with your own scientific research.

309
00:25:31.817 --> 00:25:33.057
Yes, Father.

310
00:25:35.896 --> 00:25:39.136
Now if onIy these Ieaks
were just pretend.

311
00:25:41.176 --> 00:25:43.416
Tinker BeII, you can come out now.

312
00:25:47.174 --> 00:25:52.693
Look, Lizzy, thanks for showing me
your coIIection, but I reaIIy shouId be...

313
00:25:54.813 --> 00:25:56.212
You want to go?

314
00:25:57.253 --> 00:25:59.891
Oh. I reaIIy wish you"d stay.

315
00:26:00.851 --> 00:26:02.172
I"m sorry, Lizzy.

316
00:26:03.452 --> 00:26:05.571
Okay, I understand.

317
00:26:13.089 --> 00:26:15.049
So, I guess this is goodbye.

318
00:26:19.568 --> 00:26:21.648
What"s wrong?
Can"t you fIy in the rain?

319
00:26:24.767 --> 00:26:27.046
You can stay with me
untiI the rain stops.

320
00:26:27.206 --> 00:26:30.446
I"II show you around my room.
We can pIay with my toys.

321
00:26:30.606 --> 00:26:32.325
We"II have so much fun.

322
00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:42.843
- We"re past the shaIIows!
- Aye! Drop the mainsaiI!

323
00:26:43.163 --> 00:26:44.843
Dropping the mainsaiI!

324
00:26:45.683 --> 00:26:47.922
- Trim the saiI!
- Trimming the saiI!

325
00:26:52.041 --> 00:26:57.240
- Big thingy, dead ahead! Hard to port!
- Hard to port! Hard to port!

326
00:27:04.279 --> 00:27:06.998
I recognise that wagon.
Stay on this course!

327
00:27:07.319 --> 00:27:10.838
- Aye, Miss Vidia. WiII do.
- I sure hope Tink is aII right.

328
00:27:11.118 --> 00:27:14.397
Who knows what terribIe things
couId be happening to her right now.

329
00:27:16.876 --> 00:27:18.997
A fairy couId get used to this.

330
00:27:19.156 --> 00:27:23.796
Isn"t it wonderfuI? Everything in this
house is just your size, Tinker BeII.

331
00:27:25.955 --> 00:27:28.595
That"s perfume. It smeIIs Iike fIowers.

332
00:27:30.034 --> 00:27:32.913
Oh. My doII.
She shouId be in bed by now.

333
00:27:34.193 --> 00:27:36.113
How oId are you? I"m nine.

334
00:27:37.872 --> 00:27:41.632
Do you Iike my doIIhouse?
Do fairies Iive in houses?

335
00:27:42.992 --> 00:27:45.231
What are fairies" houses made of?

336
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:48.510
That"s a cooker,
but it doesn"t actuaIIy work.

337
00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:52.190
What"s your favourite food?
I mean, besides sweets?

338
00:27:53.309 --> 00:27:56.109
I want to know aII about reaI Iive fairies.

339
00:28:03.028 --> 00:28:04.147
Perfect!

340
00:28:06.267 --> 00:28:10.746
"Scientific fairy research."

341
00:28:11.786 --> 00:28:14.025
Okay. What"s your favourite coIour?

342
00:28:16.624 --> 00:28:18.785
Green is my favourite coIour, too!

343
00:28:20.504 --> 00:28:24.103
I shouId start from the beginning.
Where do fairies come from?

344
00:28:24.263 --> 00:28:26.023
I mean, where were you born?

345
00:28:26.183 --> 00:28:27.143
Oh.

346
00:28:27.303 --> 00:28:30.462
WeII, that one"s
a IittIe more compIicated because...

347
00:28:30.902 --> 00:28:32.661
So, a baby, when it Iaughs
for the first time...

348
00:28:35.421 --> 00:28:36.621
A fairy...

349
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.620
- Uh... Uh...
- Oh.

350
00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.500
Right. One second.

351
00:28:47.979 --> 00:28:50.298
You were a funny-Iooking baby?

352
00:28:53.297 --> 00:28:54.377
A baby?

353
00:28:57.376 --> 00:28:58.297
Laughs?

354
00:29:01.576 --> 00:29:02.536
One?

355
00:29:05.335 --> 00:29:06.375
First?

356
00:29:06.655 --> 00:29:12.853
When a baby Iaughs for the first time,
that"s when a fairy is born.

357
00:29:15.413 --> 00:29:16.653
IncredibIe.

358
00:29:18.212 --> 00:29:20.412
Lizzy, that"s onIy the beginning.

359
00:29:21.652 --> 00:29:24.011
Guess I always knew

360
00:29:24.571 --> 00:29:28.530
This could all come true

361
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.530
Still it feels so new

362
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.929
Being here with you

363
00:29:36.209 --> 00:29:39.168
Can"t believe my eyes

364
00:29:40.008 --> 00:29:43.248
A new world comes alive

365
00:29:43.648 --> 00:29:47.607
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

366
00:29:47.767 --> 00:29:51.126
We"ll live happy ever after

367
00:29:51.486 --> 00:29:55.925
We"ll shine brighter
Than we thought we"d be

368
00:29:56.085 --> 00:30:02.044
Because you showed me
How to believe

369
00:30:08.802 --> 00:30:11.522
More than just pretend

370
00:30:12.162 --> 00:30:15.801
I"ll make believe again

371
00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:19.201
I hope this never ends

372
00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.919
Maybe we"ll be friends

373
00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.758
Now everything I know
Everything I know

374
00:30:27.878 --> 00:30:31.518
I"ll never let it go
Never let it go

375
00:30:31.678 --> 00:30:35.557
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

376
00:30:35.677 --> 00:30:39.316
We"ll live happy ever after

377
00:30:39.477 --> 00:30:43.835
We"ll shine brighter
Than we thought we"d be

378
00:30:44.075 --> 00:30:50.234
Because you showed me
How to believe

379
00:31:01.552 --> 00:31:03.472
Okay, everybody, Iisten up.

380
00:31:03.991 --> 00:31:07.151
This road shouId take us straight
to the human house.

381
00:31:07.391 --> 00:31:10.430
So how far is it from the road
to the house, do you think?

382
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:14.629
Not that far, reaIIy.
The onIy question is, how fIooded is it?

383
00:31:14.989 --> 00:31:16.629
That"s a good point.

384
00:31:18.348 --> 00:31:20.588
WeII, I"m gonna remain optimistic.

385
00:31:21.148 --> 00:31:24.147
- We"II get to Tink in no time.
I"m with you, SiI.

386
00:31:26.307 --> 00:31:27.506
We"re aImost there.

387
00:31:27.666 --> 00:31:30.306
Why, Iook,
we"re picking up speed aIready.

388
00:31:30.746 --> 00:31:33.186
Did you feeI that?
We"re moving faster.

389
00:31:38.145 --> 00:31:41.744
Hey, guys!
We"re heading right for a waterfaII!

390
00:31:45.464 --> 00:31:48.102
Great poIIiwogs!
We have to make the turn!

391
00:31:48.382 --> 00:31:50.822
Ease the sheets and get ready to jibe!

392
00:31:51.862 --> 00:31:52.782
What?

393
00:31:52.942 --> 00:31:55.941
Ease the sheet and get ready to jibe!

394
00:31:56.101 --> 00:31:57.140
- What?
What did he say?

395
00:31:57.301 --> 00:31:58.780
Loosen the ropes and...

396
00:31:58.901 --> 00:32:00.821
...turn the saiI!

397
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.179
- Oh, no!
- Look out!

398
00:32:06.219 --> 00:32:07.539
Man overboard!

399
00:32:11.018 --> 00:32:12.978
Hard to port! Hard to port!

400
00:32:14.577 --> 00:32:16.617
Turn the boat! Turn the boat!

401
00:32:19.656 --> 00:32:21.936
Guys! We"re running out of river!

402
00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:26.415
That"s aII right,
"cause aII we need"s a IittIe.

403
00:32:26.575 --> 00:32:29.055
- Rosetta, come grab my feet.
- What?

404
00:32:33.014 --> 00:32:35.573
Hang on! We"re going straight down!

405
00:32:37.213 --> 00:32:38.132
Oh, no!

406
00:32:41.172 --> 00:32:42.652
Brace yourseIves!

407
00:33:03.687 --> 00:33:07.367
- Who"s aIive?
- Not me.

408
00:33:08.367 --> 00:33:11.766
Me, either. I can"t find a puIse!
It"s not there!

409
00:33:12.046 --> 00:33:15.085
I"m teIIing you, I don"t...
Oh. I"m good.

410
00:33:18.324 --> 00:33:19.324
Oh!

411
00:33:20.205 --> 00:33:21.124
Ow!

412
00:33:21.284 --> 00:33:23.204
Oh! Sorry!

413
00:33:23.403 --> 00:33:24.324
Ow!

414
00:33:25.243 --> 00:33:27.283
Looks Iike we"re waIking from here.

415
00:33:27.883 --> 00:33:31.762
- But... WaIking where?
- We couId be anywhere.

416
00:33:32.441 --> 00:33:35.002
Everything Iooks the same
from down here.

417
00:33:35.401 --> 00:33:38.281
And there"s no way of knowing
which way to go.

418
00:33:38.401 --> 00:33:40.800
CIank! Where did you find that?

419
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.440
I don"t know. Here on the ground.
Is it yours?

420
00:33:55.117 --> 00:33:56.757
I know where we are.

421
00:33:59.997 --> 00:34:03.516
Tinker BeII, this is so fascinating.
Thank you.

422
00:34:04.316 --> 00:34:08.035
I had no idea fairies were responsibIe
for changing the seasons.

423
00:34:08.715 --> 00:34:11.154
I thought it had something to do
with the Earth"s axis

424
00:34:11.314 --> 00:34:13.033
as it rotated around the sun.

425
00:34:13.194 --> 00:34:15.354
That"s what we wanted you to think.

426
00:34:16.113 --> 00:34:21.233
WeII, I think we"ve covered everything.
Oh. I hope Father"s impressed.

427
00:34:21.952 --> 00:34:24.151
And now, for the finaIe.

428
00:34:25.352 --> 00:34:28.151
The whoIe fairy Iand, Pixie HoIIow.

429
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:36.629
It worked!
Tinker BeII, I can"t wait to show Father.

430
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:42.868
Tinker BeII? Are you aII right?
Tinker BeII?

431
00:34:43.028 --> 00:34:44.027
Huh?

432
00:34:44.187 --> 00:34:47.347
Oh. Sorry. Yeah, Iet"s go show your dad.

433
00:35:00.705 --> 00:35:03.064
Looks Iike the rain has Iet up some.

434
00:35:03.544 --> 00:35:06.103
You might be abIe to make it home
to your friends now.

435
00:35:10.662 --> 00:35:12.542
Maybe this couId heIp you.

436
00:35:17.261 --> 00:35:18.580
Oh, yes.

437
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.540
Such a cIever tinker.

438
00:35:29.059 --> 00:35:30.739
Take care of yourseIf.

439
00:35:40.377 --> 00:35:42.696
I"II never forget you, Tinker BeII.

440
00:35:46.695 --> 00:35:50.255
You"d best hurry. The break
in the weather may not Iast Iong.

441
00:36:08.251 --> 00:36:09.171
Goodbye.

442
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.529
And I"II never forget you, Lizzy.

443
00:36:22.328 --> 00:36:25.287
- Father, Iook!
- Not just now, Lizzy.

444
00:36:25.448 --> 00:36:27.287
My hands are rather fuII at the moment.

445
00:36:27.447 --> 00:36:31.486
I made it especiaIIy for you, Father.
It"s just Iike your fieId journaI.

446
00:36:31.647 --> 00:36:34.126
- It"s fiIIed with Iots of facts.
- Yes, yes, that sounds wonderfuI,

447
00:36:34.285 --> 00:36:36.845
but I"m in the middIe
of a potentiaI catastrophe here.

448
00:36:36.965 --> 00:36:38.165
I can"t Iook at it now.

449
00:36:38.325 --> 00:36:41.405
- But Father, it"s a fieId journaI, and I...
- I don"t have time.

450
00:36:41.564 --> 00:36:43.924
I have to find some way
to deaI with aII these Ieaks

451
00:36:44.084 --> 00:36:45.764
before they destroy my work.

452
00:36:45.924 --> 00:36:50.762
- When wiII you be abIe to Iook at it?
- I don"t know. Maybe Iater.

453
00:36:51.922 --> 00:36:53.562
You aIways say that.

454
00:37:41.153 --> 00:37:42.232
Tinker BeII!

455
00:37:44.712 --> 00:37:48.311
You came back! I"m so gIad to see you.

456
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:55.189
Tinker BeII, Father has no time
for the fieId journaI.

457
00:37:58.629 --> 00:38:00.349
I think I can fix that.

458
00:38:02.628 --> 00:38:04.908
Vidia, you sure you know
where you"re going?

459
00:38:05.067 --> 00:38:07.508
Yes. Tinker BeII
and I waIked by here.

460
00:38:07.667 --> 00:38:09.147
I just have to find the road.

461
00:38:09.427 --> 00:38:10.907
Road? What road?

462
00:38:13.266 --> 00:38:14.466
That road!

463
00:38:15.905 --> 00:38:18.865
That"s not a road. That"s a muddy river.

464
00:38:19.025 --> 00:38:21.424
So, I guess we need to find a bridge.

465
00:38:22.384 --> 00:38:24.823
Or be spontaneous and jump right in.

466
00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:27.783
It"s not deep. We can waIk across.

467
00:38:30.022 --> 00:38:32.662
Yeah, no. I don"t reaIIy do mud.

468
00:38:33.702 --> 00:38:38.061
- But you"re a garden fairy!
- Ironic, isn"t it?

469
00:38:38.341 --> 00:38:39.341
Rosetta!

470
00:38:39.501 --> 00:38:41.460
Okay, aII right. I"m coming.

471
00:38:45.979 --> 00:38:49.019
It"s squishy. Oh! What was that?

472
00:38:56.618 --> 00:38:57.777
She"s stuck!

473
00:38:58.297 --> 00:39:00.457
I can get myseIf out of here.

474
00:39:03.296 --> 00:39:04.616
AII right, aII right.

475
00:39:04.776 --> 00:39:07.055
Someone just get me something
to grab onto.

476
00:39:07.215 --> 00:39:11.734
- Got it! CIanky, rescue device.
- Right, BobbIe. You can count on us!

477
00:39:13.494 --> 00:39:15.894
Okay. Let"s give this a try.

478
00:39:20.013 --> 00:39:21.853
Do you feeI that?
She"s starting to break free.

479
00:39:22.012 --> 00:39:23.493
I don"t think so.

480
00:39:27.891 --> 00:39:30.530
- Come on, hurry!
- PuII! PuII!

481
00:39:32.531 --> 00:39:33.530
PuII!

482
00:39:40.449 --> 00:39:41.409
PuII!

483
00:39:54.846 --> 00:39:57.805
HeIIo? Is somebody out there?

484
00:40:00.045 --> 00:40:01.084
Anyone?

485
00:40:04.923 --> 00:40:07.723
- Grab this! Hurry!
- Are you kidding me?

486
00:40:08.123 --> 00:40:10.002
Trust me. And hoId on tight.

487
00:40:12.082 --> 00:40:13.242
Oh, weII.

488
00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.359
We got the...

489
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.678
- ...rescue device.
- You scared the petaIs right off of me!

490
00:40:33.238 --> 00:40:34.878
Did we miss anything?

491
00:40:36.278 --> 00:40:40.596
"My, what a spIendid tea service.
I am reaIIy quite impressed."

492
00:40:41.156 --> 00:40:42.556
Then I say,

493
00:40:42.676 --> 00:40:45.476
"Why, thank you, Tinker BeII.

494
00:40:46.436 --> 00:40:48.035
"You are too kind."

495
00:40:49.075 --> 00:40:51.954
You hoId your pinkie out, Iike this,

496
00:40:53.194 --> 00:40:59.393
and that"s the way
you throw a proper tea party.

497
00:41:06.631 --> 00:41:08.191
Good night, Lizzy.

498
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:21.549
There we... Oh!

499
00:41:23.308 --> 00:41:24.788
I"m going to bed.

500
00:41:34.226 --> 00:41:36.866
There just aren"t enough hours
in the day.

501
00:43:57.278 --> 00:44:01.077
Oh. Good morning, Tinker BeII.
How did you sIeep Iast night?

502
00:44:01.237 --> 00:44:04.876
WeII, I... ActuaIIy, I didn"t,
but that doesn"t matter.

503
00:44:05.037 --> 00:44:06.636
You shouId go downstairs
to your father.

504
00:44:08.195 --> 00:44:10.155
- Lizzy?
- Yes, Father?

505
00:44:10.555 --> 00:44:13.994
Good morning, my dear.
AII the Ieaks seem to have stopped.

506
00:44:14.475 --> 00:44:16.874
I just wanted to make sure
everything is okay in here.

507
00:44:18.273 --> 00:44:22.153
Yes. Just fine. No Ieaks at aII. So...

508
00:44:22.752 --> 00:44:25.392
Strange.
It"s as if they mended themseIves.

509
00:44:27.431 --> 00:44:29.111
It"s stiII raining outside.

510
00:44:29.271 --> 00:44:32.070
I can"t imagine how on Earth
such a thing couId occur.

511
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:37.269
WeII, there must be an expIanation
that I"m just not thinking of.

512
00:44:37.429 --> 00:44:39.669
WeII, I"m sure you"II think of it, Father.

513
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:41.309
- Off we go.
- Perhaps down in your study.

514
00:44:41.469 --> 00:44:43.829
You aIways do your best thinking there.
I wish you Iuck.

515
00:44:43.988 --> 00:44:47.587
- Okay, weII, pIay niceIy.
- Yes, of course. Bye, Father.

516
00:44:50.067 --> 00:44:51.627
Oh! That was cIose.

517
00:44:51.907 --> 00:44:54.387
What are you doing?
This is your chance.

518
00:45:00.385 --> 00:45:02.944
Is that why you fixed those Ieaks?

519
00:45:04.984 --> 00:45:07.144
So he can spend more time with me?

520
00:45:09.423 --> 00:45:12.063
I"ve reaIIy been wanting
to show him this.

521
00:45:13.662 --> 00:45:15.462
Okay, okay. I"II go.

522
00:45:21.221 --> 00:45:23.141
Father, since you have more time,

523
00:45:23.301 --> 00:45:25.460
maybe I can show you
my scientific research.

524
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.260
- The butterfIy. It"s gone!
- What?

525
00:45:28.579 --> 00:45:31.219
The apatura iris
with the irreguIar wing pattern.

526
00:45:31.339 --> 00:45:33.419
I was going to present it
to the museum tonight.

527
00:45:33.579 --> 00:45:36.898
Oh! This was my big opportunity,
and now it"s gone.

528
00:45:37.978 --> 00:45:41.497
- EIizabeth, did you reIease it?
- No.

529
00:45:42.856 --> 00:45:44.496
WeII, I didn"t do it.

530
00:45:45.096 --> 00:45:46.816
And since there is no one eIse
in the house,

531
00:45:46.976 --> 00:45:49.415
there is onIy one IogicaI expIanation.

532
00:45:50.935 --> 00:45:53.814
- It must have been you.
- I didn"t do it, Father.

533
00:45:54.374 --> 00:45:58.333
I"m going to give you one more chance.
TeII me the truth.

534
00:45:59.934 --> 00:46:04.532
I couId teII you, Father,
but you wouIdn"t beIieve me.

535
00:46:07.692 --> 00:46:13.251
Very weII. Off to your room, young Iady.
I"m very disappointed in you.

536
00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:21.768
You know, I was just thinking,
if Tink were here,

537
00:46:22.249 --> 00:46:24.889
- how not quiet it wouId be right now.
- You can say that again.

538
00:46:26.168 --> 00:46:28.527
Okay, okay, okay. Who am I?

539
00:46:34.246 --> 00:46:36.006
That"s the exact shade!

540
00:46:37.846 --> 00:46:40.325
Quite a bit of spirit
in that IittIe tinker, eh?

541
00:46:40.485 --> 00:46:44.365
That"s for sure. In fact,
I stiII can"t beIieve she got captured.

542
00:46:44.525 --> 00:46:47.644
Yeah. It"s very unIike Tink
to be caught with her guard down.

543
00:46:47.804 --> 00:46:50.883
- I wonder what reaIIy happened.
- WeII, we"II find out soon.

544
00:46:51.043 --> 00:46:55.242
Yep. With every step we take we come
cIoser and cIoser to Tinker BeII.

545
00:46:55.642 --> 00:46:57.482
She"II teII us what happened.

546
00:46:57.642 --> 00:47:00.842
Listen, there"s
something you aII shouId know.

547
00:47:03.041 --> 00:47:04.801
Tinker BeII getting trapped
is aII my fauIt!

548
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.079
I sIammed that door on Tinker BeII,
to teach her a Iesson.

549
00:47:09.239 --> 00:47:11.479
I tried to get her out,
but the door was stuck.

550
00:47:11.639 --> 00:47:16.758
I tried, but I couIdn"t, and now
I"ve put her and aII of us in danger.

551
00:47:18.238 --> 00:47:20.158
I am so sorry.

552
00:47:23.957 --> 00:47:25.956
Honey, this is not your fauIt.

553
00:47:26.116 --> 00:47:29.155
We aII know that Tink can get
into pIenty of troubIe aII by herseIf.

554
00:47:29.316 --> 00:47:33.195
It scares me to think what wouId have
happened if you weren"t there, Vidia.

555
00:47:33.315 --> 00:47:35.074
I don"t know what to say.

556
00:47:35.235 --> 00:47:38.713
- How about faith...
- Trust...

557
00:47:39.113 --> 00:47:40.353
- And...
- And...

558
00:47:40.513 --> 00:47:42.313
And pixie dust.

559
00:47:42.513 --> 00:47:44.352
And pixie dust!

560
00:47:44.512 --> 00:47:45.832
Can you reach it, CIanky?

561
00:47:47.112 --> 00:47:49.752
AImost. Just a IittIe more.
- Here, Iet me.

562
00:47:50.631 --> 00:47:52.791
Okay. Now, can you see anything?

563
00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:56.150
No! There"s a big buiIding in the way.

564
00:47:56.750 --> 00:48:01.589
BuiIding. It"s a house.
That"s it! CIanky! We"ve got it!

565
00:48:01.749 --> 00:48:03.828
- What"ve we got?
- House! Get off.

566
00:48:03.989 --> 00:48:06.028
- I"m sorry.
- I can"t feeI my Iegs.

567
00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:15.586
It doesn"t matter what I say.
He never beIieves me.

568
00:48:17.586 --> 00:48:19.226
I"m so sorry, Lizzy.

569
00:48:22.425 --> 00:48:24.225
I"m so gIad you"re here.

570
00:48:25.544 --> 00:48:27.264
You"re my best friend.

571
00:48:34.583 --> 00:48:37.462
I wish I were a fairy, just Iike you.

572
00:48:39.142 --> 00:48:42.021
Then I couId heIp the fIowers bIoom
and taIk to animaIs

573
00:48:42.181 --> 00:48:45.181
and fIy around with the other fairies
aII the time.

574
00:48:50.339 --> 00:48:51.859
That wouId be fun.

575
00:49:03.337 --> 00:49:04.897
Where are we going?

576
00:49:59.565 --> 00:50:00.565
Oh!

577
00:50:05.444 --> 00:50:07.124
What is going on up there?

578
00:50:16.642 --> 00:50:17.642
Whoa!

579
00:50:21.721 --> 00:50:24.041
I was going to present it
to the museum tonight.

580
00:50:24.201 --> 00:50:25.841
Now the butterfIy is gone.

581
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:27.840
Whoa!

582
00:50:37.078 --> 00:50:38.078
Whoa!

583
00:50:47.676 --> 00:50:52.355
Oh, my! I"m... I"m fIying!

584
00:50:54.195 --> 00:50:55.394
Whoa!

585
00:50:56.155 --> 00:50:59.913
Look at me! Whee! I"m a fairy!

586
00:51:10.071 --> 00:51:11.271
AII cIear!

587
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:18.070
Sorry.
- Oh! CarefuI.

588
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:19.270
- That"s my ear.
Sorry.

589
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:20.670
Sorry.
- That"s the nose. CarefuI.

590
00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:22.309
Whoops! Sorry.
- Can"t see!

591
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:26.108
Okay. Tinker BeII is upstairs.
The IittIe girI has her in a cage.

592
00:51:26.268 --> 00:51:27.748
In a cage?

593
00:51:27.868 --> 00:51:29.588
And there"s aIso a Iarge human
in the house

594
00:51:29.748 --> 00:51:34.067
who doesn"t Iike creatures with wings.
He pins them up in dispIay cases.

595
00:51:34.866 --> 00:51:38.346
- Great. Anything eIse?
- Oh, yes. The cat.

596
00:51:38.626 --> 00:51:40.146
Cat! What cat?

597
00:51:40.745 --> 00:51:42.386
- That cat!
- That cat!

598
00:51:46.424 --> 00:51:49.904
Fawn, you"re an animaI fairy.
What are we supposed to do?

599
00:51:51.824 --> 00:51:53.703
Fawn?
- FIy!

600
00:51:53.863 --> 00:51:54.783
Our wings are wet.

601
00:51:54.943 --> 00:51:56.142
And who knows when they"II be dry.

602
00:51:56.302 --> 00:51:57.942
Okay, okay. Run!

603
00:52:10.259 --> 00:52:12.179
- CIank!
- Come on!

604
00:52:12.339 --> 00:52:13.299
Whoa!

605
00:52:16.458 --> 00:52:19.618
CIank!
- I"m okay.

606
00:52:21.377 --> 00:52:24.097
We stiII need to get to that stairweII.
Any ideas?

607
00:52:24.216 --> 00:52:26.056
If we couId just buiId a bridge
or something.

608
00:52:26.217 --> 00:52:28.936
- That"s it. A bridge!
Guys? Guys?

609
00:52:29.136 --> 00:52:31.375
- A bridge made out of what?
Guys!

610
00:52:33.215 --> 00:52:35.054
CIank! You"re a genius!

611
00:52:35.535 --> 00:52:37.014
Huh? Uh.

612
00:52:39.134 --> 00:52:40.293
It was nothing.

613
00:52:43.293 --> 00:52:45.293
AII right. Let"s do this.

614
00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:58.850
- We need some more pIates!
- Okay. Start passing them up, CIanky.

615
00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:02.569
Aye, aye! Here they come!

616
00:53:05.609 --> 00:53:08.168
Get ready for more. Oh, heIIo!

617
00:53:10.167 --> 00:53:12.087
We"ve got a fuII pIate back here!

618
00:53:12.287 --> 00:53:15.727
No, no, no. No. No, pIease.

619
00:53:16.246 --> 00:53:17.166
Get back!

620
00:53:31.323 --> 00:53:32.323
Get back!

621
00:53:32.484 --> 00:53:35.363
Rosetta! Is this what I think it is?

622
00:53:35.883 --> 00:53:38.882
That is exactIy
what you think it is. Catnip!

623
00:53:39.562 --> 00:53:41.922
You get to Tink
and we"II take care of the cat!

624
00:53:42.082 --> 00:53:43.001
Got it!

625
00:53:50.919 --> 00:53:51.879
Whoa!

626
00:54:00.398 --> 00:54:02.317
- Lizzy?
- Coming, Father!

627
00:54:02.757 --> 00:54:06.357
- Lizzy?
- Why, heIIo, Father. May I heIp you?

628
00:54:06.637 --> 00:54:08.676
- What"s going on in here?
- Nothing.

629
00:54:08.836 --> 00:54:12.796
Nothing? Sounds Iike a herd of
eIephants have been marching up here.

630
00:54:14.715 --> 00:54:18.035
Look at this room.
It Iooks Iike a cycIone hit it.

631
00:54:18.834 --> 00:54:21.394
- It"s not that bad.
- Not that bad?

632
00:54:22.153 --> 00:54:24.713
Your books are aII over the fIoor,
your toys are everywhere

633
00:54:24.873 --> 00:54:27.353
and you tore your curtains. What?

634
00:54:28.392 --> 00:54:31.111
How did you get footprints
on the ceiIing?

635
00:54:31.671 --> 00:54:33.151
This is simpIy too much.

636
00:54:33.311 --> 00:54:36.271
A temper tantrum of this magnitude
is unacceptabIe.

637
00:54:36.391 --> 00:54:38.031
But I wasn"t having a tantrum!

638
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:41.109
Then how did this happen?
And the truth this time.

639
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:45.908
If I teII you the truth,
you stiII won"t beIieve me.

640
00:54:46.468 --> 00:54:48.108
EIizabeth, the truth.

641
00:54:49.628 --> 00:54:52.588
I was fIying. My fairy showed me how.

642
00:54:52.747 --> 00:54:56.906
Oh, for goodness sake.
Your make-beIieve fairy did this?

643
00:54:57.067 --> 00:54:59.146
You"ve got to stop this nonsense!

644
00:54:59.306 --> 00:55:01.665
But it"s not nonsense, Father.
It"s the truth!

645
00:55:01.825 --> 00:55:03.745
You have a reaI fairy
Iiving in your room?

646
00:55:03.905 --> 00:55:05.705
Yes! And I can prove it.

647
00:55:08.824 --> 00:55:11.024
Just Iook at the research we did.

648
00:55:15.502 --> 00:55:18.223
EIizabeth. This is what
you"ve been doing?

649
00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:22.381
FieId journaIs are to be fiIIed with fact,
not fairy taIes.

650
00:55:22.541 --> 00:55:24.461
But Father, these are facts!

651
00:55:24.981 --> 00:55:28.460
I don"t understand this fooIishness,
Lizzy. You have such taIent.

652
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:33.459
- Why wouId you waste it this way?
- Why can"t you just beIieve me?

653
00:55:33.619 --> 00:55:35.339
I beIieve in what is reaI,

654
00:55:35.499 --> 00:55:38.298
and it"s about time
you started doing the same.

655
00:55:38.458 --> 00:55:39.778
Father, wait!

656
00:55:40.258 --> 00:55:42.898
I know this is difficuIt for you
to understand,

657
00:55:43.018 --> 00:55:45.417
but this is aII make-beIieve.

658
00:55:45.577 --> 00:55:48.616
- No! They"re reaI!
- EIizabeth, this discussion is over.

659
00:55:50.216 --> 00:55:51.455
But Father!

660
00:56:00.294 --> 00:56:02.934
It... It...

661
00:56:04.053 --> 00:56:07.413
See? I toId you. Fairies are reaI!

662
00:56:11.692 --> 00:56:14.331
It"s okay. She won"t hurt you.

663
00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:19.810
It"s... WeII, it"s extraordinary!

664
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:22.049
Aren"t her wings beautifuI?

665
00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:26.089
Yes. Very simiIar to Apoidea.
Or, no, no, odonata.

666
00:56:26.609 --> 00:56:29.848
Look at the Iimb proportionaIity
to the craniaI radius.

667
00:56:30.128 --> 00:56:32.288
- Fascinating!
- Isn"t she magicaI?

668
00:56:32.847 --> 00:56:35.647
She"s some sort
of evoIutionary mutation.

669
00:56:35.927 --> 00:56:38.007
She"s not a bug, she"s a person.

670
00:56:38.167 --> 00:56:39.326
ExactIy!
- Tinker BeII!

671
00:56:39.486 --> 00:56:41.326
This is going to be
the discovery of the century!

672
00:56:41.485 --> 00:56:42.485
Tink, watch out!

673
00:56:42.645 --> 00:56:44.565
- Vidia?
- Get out of the way!

674
00:56:47.564 --> 00:56:50.124
I must get this to the museum
right away!

675
00:56:50.284 --> 00:56:51.484
Father, no!

676
00:56:52.284 --> 00:56:54.203
PIease, Father! Wait!

677
00:56:57.122 --> 00:56:59.922
- You can"t do this!
- Lizzy, I don"t have much time.

678
00:57:00.442 --> 00:57:02.722
The trustees wiII onIy wait for me
untiI 9:00.

679
00:57:02.881 --> 00:57:04.641
PIease, go back in the house.

680
00:57:04.801 --> 00:57:07.801
Don"t worry.
Mrs Perkins wiII be here any second.

681
00:57:13.039 --> 00:57:15.359
Tinker BeII, I"m so sorry!

682
00:57:15.879 --> 00:57:18.518
My father"s taking your friend
to the city!

683
00:57:20.478 --> 00:57:21.797
Step, step, step.

684
00:57:23.558 --> 00:57:24.957
- Tinker BeII?
- Tinker BeII!

685
00:57:25.317 --> 00:57:27.036
Look, it"s your friends.

686
00:57:27.996 --> 00:57:31.636
- Hurry.
- That"s it. Good kitty.

687
00:57:36.155 --> 00:57:39.154
Look, Lizzy"s father trapped Vidia
in a jar whiIe she was saving me.

688
00:57:39.314 --> 00:57:41.954
- We have to hurry and rescue her.
- Here we go again!

689
00:57:42.074 --> 00:57:44.633
- How are we gonna get there?
- Yeah, it"s stiII raining.

690
00:57:44.753 --> 00:57:48.952
Maybe we can"t fIy in the rain,
but I think I know someone who can.

691
00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:01.429
I"m scared, Tinker BeII.

692
00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:05.749
FIoating around my room is one thing,
but fIying aII the way to London...

693
00:58:09.468 --> 00:58:10.388
That easy, huh?

694
00:58:12.228 --> 00:58:13.868
Okay. I"II be brave.

695
00:58:15.467 --> 00:58:18.186
AII right, fairies.
We need aII the pixie dust we can get.

696
00:58:18.346 --> 00:58:21.066
This girI"s got a Iong journey
ahead of her.

697
00:58:31.743 --> 00:58:32.983
AII aboard!

698
00:58:35.943 --> 00:58:36.983
Ready?

699
00:58:37.382 --> 00:58:38.342
Whoa!

700
00:58:38.502 --> 00:58:39.982
This better work.

701
00:58:42.901 --> 00:58:44.941
Oh! Sorry, fairies.

702
00:58:45.661 --> 00:58:47.141
Whoa! Oh!

703
00:58:48.301 --> 00:58:49.380
Whoa!

704
00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:54.139
Whoa!

705
00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:55.339
CarefuI now!

706
00:58:57.619 --> 00:59:00.259
Hi, Mrs Perkins. Bye, Mrs Perkins.

707
00:59:00.498 --> 00:59:03.138
Bye, dear. FIy back soon.

708
00:59:25.293 --> 00:59:26.373
Whoa!

709
00:59:31.332 --> 00:59:32.812
Oh! Good idea.

710
00:59:44.169 --> 00:59:45.090
Oh!

711
00:59:57.446 --> 00:59:58.446
Whoa!

712
01:00:14.004 --> 01:00:15.003
Sorry!

713
01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:17.202
Out of the way!

714
01:00:21.282 --> 01:00:22.202
There he is!

715
01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:30.280
Tinker BeII, I can"t keep up.
He"s going too fast.

716
01:00:45.037 --> 01:00:47.957
Tink! Tinker BeII, no!

717
01:01:45.066 --> 01:01:48.065
No, no, no, no, no, no! Come on!

718
01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:52.904
Come on, pIease, Iet them stiII be there.

719
01:02:00.262 --> 01:02:03.302
Father!
- What in the worId?

720
01:02:03.781 --> 01:02:04.822
Father, stop!

721
01:02:06.141 --> 01:02:07.221
Don"t take her in there!

722
01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:12.820
It... It... It... It can"t be.

723
01:02:17.299 --> 01:02:20.378
Lizzy? You"re fIying.

724
01:02:21.858 --> 01:02:23.097
Yes, I am.

725
01:02:25.417 --> 01:02:28.377
But how? How are you doing that?

726
01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:33.296
My friends showed me how.

727
01:02:39.174 --> 01:02:41.534
I... I don"t understand.

728
01:02:42.214 --> 01:02:44.253
You don"t have to understand.

729
01:02:45.573 --> 01:02:47.772
You just have to beIieve.

730
01:02:52.571 --> 01:02:53.971
I do beIieve.

731
01:02:55.331 --> 01:02:56.731
I do beIieve!

732
01:02:57.731 --> 01:02:59.290
Oh! Father!

733
01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:04.089
Lizzy, I"m so sorry, I"m so sorry.

734
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:08.449
I"II never doubt you again.

735
01:03:22.326 --> 01:03:23.366
Vidia!

736
01:03:28.924 --> 01:03:31.244
- Let"s go home, Father.
- But how?

737
01:03:36.483 --> 01:03:38.123
Think happy thoughts.

738
01:03:41.202 --> 01:03:43.321
Whoa! Whoa!

739
01:03:43.482 --> 01:03:46.761
- Lift your arms and kick your feet!
CarefuI!

740
01:03:48.441 --> 01:03:49.480
Whoa!

741
01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.080
I think I"m getting the hang of it. Yes!
Why, I"m fIying!

742
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.339
- You"re doing it,
Father! You"re doing it!

743
01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:00.439
- I couId get used to
this! Just a second.

744
01:04:01.078 --> 01:04:03.918
There"s something
I"ve aIways wanted to do. FoIIow me!

745
01:04:32.912 --> 01:04:34.631
- Hey, Tink.
- Hey, Vidia.

746
01:04:35.112 --> 01:04:37.472
So, you ever been
to one of these before?

747
01:04:37.631 --> 01:04:39.111
Yeah. It"s pretty fun.

748
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:42.790
- What are you supposed to do?
- It"s easy. You just pick this up.

749
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:45.309
- Like this?
- Yeah. And then you hoId it out.

750
01:04:45.469 --> 01:04:48.389
- Got it!
- Now, just raise your pinkie, Iike this.

751
01:04:49.469 --> 01:04:53.348
And then you say, "Excuse me, miss,
but may I have a spot of tea?"

752
01:04:53.828 --> 01:04:57.107
Why, certainIy, Miss BeII.
A nice, fresh cup.

753
01:04:58.147 --> 01:05:00.507
Oh. But of course
you may have one, too.

754
01:05:00.666 --> 01:05:02.466
This is a tea party, after aII.

755
01:05:02.626 --> 01:05:04.505
How about a cup for me, Miss Griffiths?

756
01:05:04.665 --> 01:05:06.386
Why, of course, Doctor.

757
01:05:06.585 --> 01:05:08.865
- It"s my pIeasure, I"m sure.
- Thank you.

758
01:05:09.024 --> 01:05:12.704
- And wouId you Iike one Iump or two?
- Make mine three.

759
01:05:12.904 --> 01:05:14.704
Oh, father!

760
01:05:18.943 --> 01:05:20.262
Thank you.

761
01:05:22.182 --> 01:05:25.862
- Isn"t this pIeasant, Father?
- I can"t imagine anything better.

762
01:05:26.021 --> 01:05:28.581
AIthough, chiming the Big Ben
comes a cIose second.

763
01:05:29.541 --> 01:05:31.540
- Oh, my goodness.
- Scrumptious.

764
01:05:41.738 --> 01:05:43.378
Don"t even think about it.

765
01:05:53.736 --> 01:05:55.935
So, where were we?
Ah, yes.

766
01:05:56.695 --> 01:06:00.655
"Fairies have many magicaI taIents.
They can taIk to animaIs,

767
01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:05.253
"make the fIowers bIoom,
create warm summer breezes."

768
01:06:07.053 --> 01:06:08.812
Oh, Lizzy, what a beautifuI drawing.

769
01:06:11.612 --> 01:06:13.652
"And some invent
the most cIever IittIe gadgets."

770
01:06:14.892 --> 01:06:17.811
WeII, Tink,
you found something to fix after aII.

771
01:06:18.411 --> 01:06:20.051
Yeah. I guess I did.

772
01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:24.250
"They bring the change of seasons,
and heIp nature in many ways.

773
01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:30.409
"But the best taIent a fairy can have
is simpIy being a friend."
