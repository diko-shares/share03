have two entirely

You don't have to be scared.
I'm very nice.

345
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.760
You're so little.

346
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.320
Your dress is very leafy.
Did you make it yourself?

347
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.200
I like your wings.
They're like
sparkly lace.

348
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.800
Your hair must be so soft.

349
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.600
Are you hungry?
Maybe not.
That's okay.

350
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.360
I don't like some
kinds of food, either.

351
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.360
Oh!

352
00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.440
I'm so sorry.
Where are my manners?

353
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.400
There you go.

354
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:43.160
Wait!
Wait! Wait! No, please!
I'm not going to hurt you!

355
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.880
Don't be afraid!
I just want to
be your friend!

356
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.720
I really won't hurt you.
I just love fairies.

357
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.840
I've been drawing fairies
all my life. See?

358
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.960
I drew that one
when I was three,

359
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
but I did that
green one last week.

360
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.160
(CHUCKLES) I think
it's much better.

361
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.520
I even started to paint
with the watercolors
Father gave me.

362
00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.200
Is it true that some fairies
paint butterfly wings?

363
00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.360
I knew it!

364
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.640
These are some
of my favorite drawings.

365
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.400
This is a water fairy.

366
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.440
You can tell because
her skin is blue.

367
00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.680
Blue?

368
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.160
And here is a candy fairy
living in a lollipop tree.

369
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.200
Do all fairies live in trees
made of sweets?

370
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.040
Really?
What about fairy circles?

371
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.920
Well, I hear
that if a person
steps in one,

372
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.680
a fairy has to
grant them three wishes
from their magic bag.

373
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.040
But if they don't,
they turn into a pile
of delicious sugar,

374
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.400
and then
younger fairies...
(LAUGHS) Wait. Wait a minute.

375
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.440
...must try and
turn them back into...

376
00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.240
Where are you
getting all this?

jingle when you talk,

381
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.760
So what do you
think of my fairies?
Oh! And my fairy house!

382
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.080
It got a little shaken up.

383
00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.240
Did you make this?

384
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.120
I don't know
what you're saying.

385

Oh.
Did I make the fairy house?
Yes, I did. Do you like it?

386
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.440
Oh. The door's stuck.

387
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.600
Well, you're quite
the little tinker,
aren't you?

388
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.440
What? Is that your name?
Tinker?

389
00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.840

Well, Tinker Bell,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.760
Lizzy?
Who are you talking to?

400
00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.880
Oh. Um...

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.640
That's nice, dear.
Now, I brought you

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.560
something I think
you'll really enjoy.

404

These are some of my
old field journals.

Now, I picked out the ones
I thought would excite you
the most.

406
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.440
This one
on rocks and minerals
is particularly interesting.

407
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.840
Is there a field journal
about fairies?

408
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.080
(LAUGHS)
Of course not, Lizzy.

409
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.240
Books like this
are based on fact
and scientific research,

410
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.160
which is the quite
the contrary

411
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.040
to your little
figurines and drawings.

412
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.240
Well,
just because you've
never seen a fairy

413
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.200
doesn't mean
they're not real.

414
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.600
Now, Lizzy,
seeing is believing,

415
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.480
and without proof,
it's just a fairy tale.

416

something to do

for you, Father.

It's just like
your field journal.

lots of facts.

But Father,
it's a field journal,
and I...

I don't have time.

I have to find some way
to deal with all these leaks

destroy my work.

able to look at it?

690
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.720
Okay, well, play nicely.

691
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.680
Yes, of course.
Bye, Father.

692
00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.880
(SIGHS) Oh!
That was close.

693
00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.720
What are you doing?
This is your chance.

694
00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.680
Is that why you
fixed those leaks?

695
00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.080
So he can spend
more time with me?

696
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.160
I've really been wanting
to show him this.

697
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.760
Okay, okay. I'll go.

698
00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.760
Father,
since you have more time,

699
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.120
maybe I can show you
my scientific research.

700
00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.920
DR. GRIFFITHS:
The butterfly. It's gone!

701
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.040
LIZZY: What?

702
00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:24.080
The <i>apatura iris</i>
with the irregular
wing pattern.

703
00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:26.440
I was going to present it
to the museum tonight.

704
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.080
Oh! This was
my big opportunity,
and now it's gone.

705
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.760
Elizabeth,
did you release it?

706
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:34.840
No.

707
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.000
Well, I didn't do it.

708
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.440
And since there
is no one else
in the house,

709
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.120
there is only one
logical explanation.

710
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.160
It must have been you.

711
00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.760
I didn't do it, Father.

712
00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.360
I'm going to give
you one more chance.
Tell me the truth.

(SNIFFLES)

714
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.920
I could tell you, Father,
but you wouldn't believe me.

715
00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:07.960
Very well.
Off to your room, young lady.
I'm very disappointed in you.

716
00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.840
You know,
I was just thinking,
if Tink were here,

717
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.120
how not quiet it
would be right now.

718
00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.240
You can say that again.

719
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.320
(LAUGHING)

720
00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.920

That's the exact shade!

725
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:36.200
BOBBLE: Quite a bit of spirit
in that little tinker, eh?

726
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.400
That's for sure.
In fact, I still can't
believe she got captured.

727
00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.840
Yeah. It's very unlike Tink
to be caught
with her guard down.

728
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.560
I wonder what
really happened.

729
00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.200
Well, we'll find out soon.

730
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.640
Yep. With every
step we take we come

731
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.760
closer and closer
to Tinker Bell.

732
00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.080
She'll tell us
what happened.

(CLEARS THROAT)
Listen,

734
00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.600
there's something
you all should know.

735
00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.720
Tinker Bell getting trapped
is all my fault!

(ALL GASP)

737
00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.200
I slammed that
door on Tinker Bell,
to teach her a lesson.

738
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.680
I tried to get her out,
but the door was stuck.

739
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.960
I tried,
but I couldn't,

740
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.200
and now I've put her
and all of us in danger.

741
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.760
I am so sorry.

742
00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.800
Honey,
this is not your fault.

743

We all know that Tink
can get into plenty of
trouble all by herself.

744
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.840
It scares me to think
what would have happened

745

if you weren't
there, Vidia.

746
00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.360

No! There's a big
building in the way.

It's a house.

I wish I were a fairy,

Then I could help
the flowers bloom
and talk to animals

with the other fairies
all the time.
