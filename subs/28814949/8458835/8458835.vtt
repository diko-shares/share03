<i>Bad, bad boy</i>
<i>Shiny toy with a price</i>

<i>I'm not dying</i>

61

<i>With you</i>

76
00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:41.916
<i>All right, Los Angeles,</i>
<i>we have arrived...</i>

77
00:04:43.618 --> 00:04:46.386
<i>...at the very first bridge</i>
<i>of the evening.</i>

78
00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.389
<i>Now, I have a question.</i>

79
00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:52.593
<i>Does anyone here know</i>
<i>the lyrics to this bridge?</i>

80
00:04:52.627 --> 00:04:55.096
<i>Prove it!</i>

81
00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.430
<i>I'm drunk</i>
<i>in the back of the car</i>

82
00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.934
<i>And I cried like a baby</i>
<i>coming home from the bar</i>

83
00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:00.835
<i>Oh</i>

84
00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:02.837
<i>Said, "I'm fine"</i>
<i>But it wasn't true</i>

85
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.807
<i>I don't wanna keep secrets</i>
<i>just to keep you</i>

86
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.810
<i>And I snuck in</i>
<i>through the garden gate</i>

87
00:05:08.843 --> 00:05:10.945
<i>Every night that summer</i>
<i>just to seal my fate</i>

88
00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:11.846
<i>Oh</i>

89
00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.447
<i>And I screamed</i>
<i>for whatever it's worth</i>

90
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.448
<i>"I love you"</i>

91
00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.819
<i>Ain't that the worst thing</i>
<i>you ever heard?</i>

92
00:05:17.852 --> 00:05:20.353
<i>He looks up</i>
<i>grinning like a devil</i>

93
00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:22.924

127

<i>Come to think of it,</i>

128
00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:46.634

129
00:08:08.022 --> 00:08:10.658
<i>Uh-oh. I mean, this...</i>

130
00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:11.826
<i>This is getting dangerous.</i>

131
00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:14.628
<i>This is about to start going</i>

<i>I mean,</i>
<i>you just made me feel so...</i>

133

134
00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:50.097
<i>I mean,</i>

135
00:08:51.165 --> 00:08:52.933
<i>you're making me feel...</i>

136
00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:56.804
<i>like I get to play</i>
<i>a sold-out show</i>

137
00:08:56.837 --> 00:08:58.572
<i>at SoFi Stadium tonight.</i>

138
00:09:19.894 --> 00:09:20.928
<i>I guess what I'm trying</i>
<i>to say is</i>

139
00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:23.064
<i>you're making me feel like</i>
<i>I'm</i> The Man.

140
00:09:27.068 --> 00:09:28.769
<i>I would be complex</i>

141
00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:31.672
<i>I would be cool</i>

142
00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:32.973
<i>They'd say</i>
<i>I played the field</i>

143
00:09:33.007 --> 00:09:35.976
<i>Before I found</i>
<i>someone to commit to</i>

144
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.878
<i>And that would be okay</i>

145
00:09:37.912 --> 00:09:39.647
<i>For me to do</i>

146
00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:42.049
<i>Every conquest I had made</i>

147
00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:44.718
<i>Would make me</i>
<i>more of a boss to you</i>

148
00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:48.022
<i>I'd be a fearless leader</i>

149
00:09:48.055 --> 00:09:50.057
<i>I'd be an alpha type</i>

150
00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:52.693
<i>When everyone believes ya</i>

151
00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:53.627
<i>What's that like?</i>

152
00:09:53.661 --> 00:09:58.699
<i>I'm so sick of running</i>
<i>as fast as I can</i>

153
00:09:58.732 --> 00:10:00.101
<i>Wondering</i>
<i>if I'd get there quicker</i>

154
00:10:00.134 --> 00:10:02.770
<i>If I was a man</i>

155
00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:05.873
<i>And I'm so sick of them</i>
<i>coming at me again</i>

156
00:10:06.774 --> 00:10:08.175
<i>'Cause if I was a man</i>

157
00:10:09.076 --> 00:10:10.878
<i>Then I'd be the man</i>

158
00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.880
<i>-I'd be the man</i>
<i>-Man</i>

159
00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:17.051
<i>-I'd be the man</i>
<i>-Man</i>

160
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.856
<i>They'd say I hustled</i>

161
00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:23.991
<i>Put in the work</i>

162
00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:24.959
<i>They wouldn't</i>
<i>shake their heads</i>

163
00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:28.262
<i>And question</i>
<i>how much of this I deserve</i>

164
00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:29.897
<i>What I was wearing</i>

165
00:10:30.764 --> 00:10:31.866
<i>If I was rude</i>

166
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.168
<i>Could all be separated</i>

167
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:37.104
<i>From my good ideas</i>
<i>and power moves</i>

168
00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:39.974
<i>And they would</i>
<i>toast to me, oh</i>

169
00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:42.042
<i>-Hey!</i>
<i>-Let the players play</i>

170
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.012
<i>I'd be just like Leo</i>

171
00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:46.680
<i>In Saint-Tropez</i>

172
00:10:46.714 --> 00:10:49.817
<i>I'm so sick of running</i>
<i>as fast as I can</i>

173
00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:52.820
<i>Wondering</i>
<i>if I'd get there quicker</i>

174
00:10:52.853 --> 00:10:54.989
<i>If I was a man</i>

175
00:10:55.022 --> 00:10:58.192
<i>And I'm so sick of them</i>
<i>coming at me again</i>

176
00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:00.794
<i>'Cause if I was a man</i>

177
00:11:01.228 --> 00:11:03.063
<i>Then I'd be the man</i>

178
00:11:03.097 --> 00:11:05.199
<i>-I'd be the man</i>
<i>-Man</i>

179
00:11:07.735 --> 00:11:09.670
<i>-I'd be the man</i>
<i>-Man</i>

180
00:11:11.138 --> 00:11:12.773
<i>What's it like</i>
<i>to brag about</i>

181
00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:14.041
<i>Raking in dollars</i>

182
00:11:14.074 --> 00:11:16.177
<i>And getting</i>
<i>bitches and models</i>

183
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.179
<i>And it's all good</i>
<i>if you're bad</i>

184
00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:20.314
<i>And it's okay</i>
<i>if you're mad</i>

185
00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:22.783
<i>If I was out</i>
<i>flashing my dollars</i>

186
00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:24.818
<i>I'd be a bitch, not a baller</i>

187
00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:26.887
<i>They'd paint me out</i>
<i>to be bad</i>

188
00:11:26.921 --> 00:11:29.857
<i>So it's okay that I'm mad</i>

189
00:11:38.933 --> 00:11:43.270
<i>I'm so sick of running</i>
<i>as fast as I can</i>

190
00:11:43.304 --> 00:11:45.105
<i>Wondering</i>
<i>if I'd get there quicker</i>

191
00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:47.274
<i>If I was a man</i>

192
00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:50.711
<i>And I'm so sick of them</i>

193
00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:53.847
<i>'Cause if I was a man</i>

194
00:11:53.881 --> 00:11:56.150
<i>-Then I'd be the man</i>
<i>-Hey!</i>

195
00:11:56.183 --> 00:12:00.354
<i>I'm so sick of running</i>
<i>as fast as I can</i>

196
00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:02.356
<i>Wondering</i>
<i>if I'd get there quicker</i>

197
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.825
<i>If I was a man</i>

198
00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:08.128
<i>And I'm so sick of them</i>

199
00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:11.131
<i>'Cause if I was a man</i>

200

<i>-I'd be the man</i>
<i>-Man</i>

202

<i>-I'd be the man</i>
<i>-Man</i>

203

<i>Then I'd be the man</i>

207
00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:56.578
<i>You are somebody</i>
<i>that we don't know</i>

208
00:12:56.611 --> 00:12:59.013
<i>But you're coming</i>
<i>at my friends like a missile</i>

209
00:12:59.046 --> 00:13:00.247
<i>Why are you mad?</i>

210
00:13:01.982 --> 00:13:03.083
<i>When you could be GLAAD?</i>

211
00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:04.952
<i>GLAAD</i>

212
00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:08.188
<i>Sunshine on the street</i>
<i>at the parade</i>

213
00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:10.157
<i>But you would rather be</i>
<i>in the dark ages</i>

214
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.992
<i>Making that sign</i>

215
00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:14.862
<i>Must've taken all night</i>

216
00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:21.101
<i>You just need</i>
<i>to take several seats</i>

217
00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:22.336
<i>And then try</i>
<i>to restore the peace</i>

218
00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:24.004
<i>And control your urges</i>
<i>to scream</i>

219
00:13:24.038 --> 00:13:26.206
<i>About all the people</i>
<i>you hate</i>

220
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:30.444
<i>'Cause shade never made</i>
<i>anybody less gay so</i>

221
00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:35.916
<i>So, oh-oh, oh-oh,</i>
<i>oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

222
00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:37.318
<i>You need to calm down</i>

223
00:13:38.352 --> 00:13:40.120
<i>You're being too loud</i>

224
00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:43.324
<i>And I'm just like</i>
<i>oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

225
00:13:43.357 --> 00:13:46.894
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh</i>

226
00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:49.897
<i>You need to just stop</i>

227
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.299
<i>Like, can you just</i>
<i>not step on his gown?</i>

228
00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:54.068
<i>You need to calm down</i>

229
00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:56.970
<i>And we see you over there</i>
<i>on the Internet</i>

230
00:13:57.004 --> 00:13:59.373
<i>Comparing all the girls</i>
<i>who are killing it</i>

231
00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:01.208
<i>But we figured you out</i>

232
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:04.044
<i>We all know now</i>
<i>We all got crowns</i>

233
00:14:04.078 --> 00:14:07.247
<i>-You need to calm down</i>
<i>-Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

234
00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:09.883
<i>Let me see your hands!</i>

235
00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:11.218
<i>You need to calm down</i>

236
00:14:12.486 --> 00:14:14.121
<i>You're being too loud</i>

237
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:17.358
<i>And I'm just like</i>
<i>oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

238
00:14:17.391 --> 00:14:21.028
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh</i>

239
00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:22.429
<i>You need to just stop</i>

240
00:14:22.463 --> 00:14:23.397
<i>Can you stop?</i>

241
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.400
<i>Like, can you just</i>
<i>not step on our gowns?</i>

242
00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:28.268
<i>You need to calm down</i>

243
00:14:58.098 --> 00:14:59.701
<i>It is</i>

244
00:14:59.734 --> 00:15:03.337
<i>an honor and a delight</i>
<i>to say these words to you.</i>

245
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.006
<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>The Eras Tour.</i>

246
00:15:15.517 --> 00:15:17.384
<i>I mean, look at you, though.</i>

247
00:15:17.418 --> 00:15:19.953
<i>Like, look at what I get</i>
<i>to play with tonight.</i>

248
00:15:19.987 --> 00:15:22.423
<i>I get to sing with you,</i>
<i>and dance with you,</i>

249
00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:23.490
<i>and vibe with you,</i>

250
00:15:23.525 --> 00:15:26.093
<i>and hang out with you</i>
<i>all night. Look at you.</i>

251
00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:28.495
<i>You know,</i>

252
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.399
<i>we get a good sense of a crowd</i>
<i>in the first couple of songs.</i>

253
00:15:32.433 --> 00:15:34.034
<i>We realize if</i>
<i>it's going to be</i>

254
00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.302
<i>like a soulmate crowd</i>
<i>situation,</i>

255
00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:38.506
<i>and it feels so promising,</i>
<i>I just have to</i>
<i>tell you that.</i>

256
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.374
<i>It's looking so good.</i>

257
00:15:47.314 --> 00:15:48.415
<i>So you and I,</i>

258
00:15:48.449 --> 00:15:50.984
<i>we're about to go on</i>
<i>a little adventure together.</i>

259
00:15:51.018 --> 00:15:54.388
<i>And that adventure is going</i>
<i>to span 17 years of music,</i>

260
00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:57.991
<i>and it's going to be</i>
<i>one era at a time.</i>

261
00:15:58.025 --> 00:16:00.160
<i>How does that sound to you?</i>

262
00:16:05.098 --> 00:16:06.033
<i>All right,</i>
<i>so let me tell you</i>

263
00:16:06.066 --> 00:16:08.335
<i>my secret little dream</i>
<i>for this evening.</i>

264
00:16:08.368 --> 00:16:10.370
<i>So these are songs</i>

265
00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:13.173
<i>that I have written</i>
<i>about my life</i>

266
00:16:13.207 --> 00:16:15.108
<i>or things I felt</i>
<i>at one point in time</i>

267
00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:15.944
<i>whether I was a teenager,</i>

268
00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:19.346
<i>in my 20s,</i>
<i>or a couple years ago,</i>

269
00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:21.281
<i>but after tonight,</i>
<i>when you hear these songs</i>

270
00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:22.449
<i>out and about in the world,</i>

271
00:16:22.483 --> 00:16:26.086
<i>my dream is that you're gonna</i>
<i>think about tonight</i>

272
00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:28.590
<i>and the memories we made</i>
<i>here together at SoFi Stadium.</i>

273
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.492
<i>I'll be your host</i>
<i>this evening.</i>

274
00:16:31.526 --> 00:16:32.794
<i>My name is Taylor.</i>

275
00:16:32.827 --> 00:16:35.262
<i>Thank you for traveling</i>
<i>with us here</i>
<i>at The Eras Tour.</i>

276
00:16:36.731 --> 00:16:41.268
<i>We could leave</i>
<i>the Christmas lights</i>
<i>up till January</i>

277
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:48.308
<i>This is our place</i>
<i>We make the rules</i>

278
00:16:50.077 --> 00:16:51.646
<i>And there's a dazzling haze</i>

279
00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:55.082
<i>A mysterious way</i>
<i>about you, dear</i>

280
00:16:57.852 --> 00:17:02.356
<i>Have I known you</i>
<i>20 seconds or 20 years?</i>

281
00:17:04.258 --> 00:17:10.297
<i>Can I go where you go?</i>

282
00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:16.370
<i>Can we always be this close?</i>

283
00:17:16.403 --> 00:17:19.273
<i>Forever and ever, and, ah</i>

284
00:17:19.306 --> 00:17:23.043
<i>Take me out</i>
<i>and take me home</i>

285
00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:30.518
<i>You're my, my, my, my</i>

286
00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:32.319
<i>Lover</i>

287
00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:45.232
<i>We could let our friends</i>
<i>crash in the living room</i>

288
00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:50.605
<i>This is our place</i>
<i>We make the call</i>

289
00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.175
<i>And I'm highly suspicious</i>

290
00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:58.412
<i>That everyone who sees you</i>
<i>wants you</i>

291
00:17:59.614 --> 00:18:02.684
<i>I've loved you</i>
<i>three summers now, honey</i>

292
00:18:02.717 --> 00:18:05.587
<i>But I want 'em all</i>

293
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:14.227
<i>Can I go where you go?</i>

294
00:18:14.261 --> 00:18:19.399
<i>Can we always be this close?</i>

295
00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:22.302
<i>Forever and ever, and, ah</i>

296
00:18:22.336 --> 00:18:26.106
<i>Take me out</i>
<i>and take me home</i>

297
00:18:26.507 --> 00:18:28.342
<i>Forever and ever</i>

298
00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:33.715
<i>You're my, my, my, my</i>

299
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:35.516
<i>Lover</i>

300
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.686
<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>
<i>Will you please stand?</i>

301
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.523
<i>With every guitar string</i>
<i>scar on my hand</i>

302
00:18:42.557 --> 00:18:49.530
<i>I take this magnetic force</i>
<i>of a man to be my lover</i>

303
00:18:49.564 --> 00:18:53.166
<i>My heart's been borrowed</i>
<i>and yours has been blue</i>

304
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.370
<i>All's well that ends well</i>
<i>to end up with you</i>

305
00:18:56.403 --> 00:19:03.377
<i>Swear to be overdramatic</i>
<i>and true to my lover</i>

306
00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.646
<i>And you'll save</i>

307
00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:09.416
<i>All your dirtiest jokes for me</i>

308
00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:15.556
<i>And at every table</i>
<i>I'll save you a seat</i>

309
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.491
<i>Lover</i>

310
00:19:17.525 --> 00:19:23.330
<i>Can I go where you go?</i>

311
00:19:24.297 --> 00:19:29.269
<i>Can we always be this close?</i>

312
00:19:29.302 --> 00:19:32.406
<i>Forever and ever, and, ah</i>

313
00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:36.343
<i>Take me out</i>
<i>and take me home</i>

314
00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:38.311
<i>Forever and ever</i>

315
00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:44.652
<i>You're my, my, my, my</i>

316
00:19:44.686 --> 00:19:51.425
<i>Oh, you're my, my, my, my</i>

317
00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:57.632
<i>Oh, darling</i>
<i>You're my, my, my, my</i>

318
00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:00.568
<i>Lover</i>

319
00:20:48.783 --> 00:20:51.351
<i>There's something</i>
<i>about the way</i>

320
00:20:51.384 --> 00:20:53.821
<i>The street looks</i>
<i>when it's just rained</i>

321
00:20:53.855 --> 00:20:56.591
<i>There's a glow</i>
<i>off the pavement</i>

322
00:20:56.624 --> 00:20:58.526
<i>You walk me to the car</i>

323
00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:03.497
<i>And you know I wanna</i>
<i>ask you to dance right there</i>

324
00:21:03.531 --> 00:21:07.334
<i>In the middle</i>
<i>of the parking lot</i>

325
00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:08.435
<i>Yeah</i>

326
00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:19.781
<i>We're drivin' down the road</i>

327
00:21:19.814 --> 00:21:22.617
<i>I wonder if you know</i>

328
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:27.420
<i>I'm trying so hard</i>
<i>not to get caught up now</i>

329
00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:29.422
<i>But you're just so cool</i>

330
00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:31.759
<i>Run your hands</i>
<i>through your hair</i>

331
00:21:31.793 --> 00:21:36.697
<i>Absentmindedly</i>
<i>makin' me want you</i>

332
00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:41.669
<i>And I don't know</i>
<i>how it gets better than this</i>

333
00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:46.473
<i>You take my hand and drag me</i>
<i>headfirst, fearless</i>

334
00:21:46.507 --> 00:21:51.612
<i>And I don't know why</i>
<i>but with you I'd dance</i>

335
00:21:51.646 --> 00:21:56.316
<i>In a storm in my best dress</i>
<i>Fearless</i>

336
00:22:05.726 --> 00:22:09.697
<i>Well, you stood there</i>
<i>with me in the doorway</i>

337
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:14.434
<i>My hands shake</i>
<i>I'm not usually this way</i>

338
00:22:14.467 --> 00:22:18.906
<i>But you pull me in</i>
<i>and I'm a little more brave</i>

339
00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.676
<i>It's the first kiss</i>
<i>it's flawless</i>

340
00:22:21.709 --> 00:22:23.811
<i>Really somethin'</i>

341
00:22:25.613 --> 00:22:27.748
<i>It's fearless</i>

342
00:22:31.552 --> 00:22:34.822
<i>Oh, oh, oh, yeah</i>

343
00:22:36.924 --> 00:22:41.662
<i>And I don't know</i>
<i>how it gets better than this</i>

344
00:22:41.696 --> 00:22:46.167
<i>You take my hand and drag me</i>
<i>headfirst, fearless</i>

345
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:51.639
<i>And I don't know why</i>
<i>but with you I'd dance</i>

346
00:22:51.672 --> 00:22:55.843
<i>In a storm in my best dress</i>
<i>Fearless</i>

347
00:22:57.712 --> 00:22:58.913
<i>Oh, oh</i>

348
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.481
<i>Oh, oh, yeah</i>

349
00:23:14.762 --> 00:23:15.596
<i>All right, L.A.,</i>
<i>are you ready</i>

350
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.899
<i>to go back</i>
<i>to high school with me?</i>

351
00:23:21.535 --> 00:23:23.905
<i>You're on the phone</i>
<i>with your girlfriend</i>

352
00:23:23.938 --> 00:23:24.972
<i>She's upset</i>

353
00:23:25.006 --> 00:23:28.976
<i>She's going off about</i>
<i>something that you said</i>

354
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:34.481
<i>She doesn't</i>
<i>get your humor like I do</i>

355
00:23:36.517 --> 00:23:37.718
<i>I'm in my room</i>

356
00:23:37.752 --> 00:23:40.221
<i>It's a typical Tuesday night</i>

357
00:23:40.254 --> 00:23:43.891
<i>I'm listening to the kind</i>
<i>of music she doesn't like</i>

358
00:23:43.925 --> 00:23:49.462
<i>And she'll never</i>
<i>know your story like I do</i>

359
00:23:50.831 --> 00:23:54.635
<i>But she wears short skirts</i>
<i>I wear T-shirts</i>

360
00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:58.639
<i>She's cheer captain</i>
<i>and I'm on the bleachers</i>

361
00:23:58.673 --> 00:24:01.842
<i>Dreaming about the day</i>
<i>when you wake up and find</i>

362
00:24:01.876 --> 00:24:05.079
<i>That what you're looking for</i>
<i>has been here the whole time</i>

363
00:24:05.112 --> 00:24:07.882
<i>If you could see</i>
<i>that I'm the one</i>

364
00:24:07.915 --> 00:24:09.684
<i>Who understands you</i>

365
00:24:09.717 --> 00:24:15.589
<i>Been here all along</i>
<i>So, why can't you see?</i>

366
00:24:15.623 --> 00:24:19.492
<i>You belong with me</i>

367
00:24:19.527 --> 00:24:20.995
<i>You belong with me</i>

368
00:24:24.598 --> 00:24:28.636
<i>Walk in the streets with you</i>
<i>in your worn-out jeans</i>

369
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:32.106
<i>I can't help thinking</i>
<i>this is how it ought to be</i>

370
00:24:32.139 --> 00:24:35.977
<i>Laughing on a park bench</i>
<i>thinking to myself</i>

371
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.980
<i>Hey, isn't this easy?</i>

372
00:24:39.013 --> 00:24:40.715
<i>And you've got a smile</i>

373
00:24:40.748 --> 00:24:43.084
<i>That can light up</i>
<i>this whole town</i>

374
00:24:43.117 --> 00:24:46.921
<i>I haven't seen it in a while</i>
<i>since she brought you down</i>

375
00:24:46.954 --> 00:24:50.558
<i>You say you're fine</i>
<i>I know you better than that</i>

376
00:24:50.591 --> 00:24:53.694
<i>Hey, what you doing</i>
<i>with a girl like that?</i>

377
00:24:53.728 --> 00:24:57.732
<i>She wears high heels</i>
<i>I wear sneakers</i>

378
00:24:57.765 --> 00:25:00.968
<i>She's cheer captain</i>
<i>and I'm on the bleachers</i>

379
00:25:01.002 --> 00:25:04.572
<i>Dreaming about the day</i>
<i>when you wake up and find</i>

380
00:25:04.605 --> 00:25:07.975
<i>That what you're looking for</i>
<i>has been here the whole time</i>

381
00:25:08.009 --> 00:25:10.878
<i>If you could see</i>
<i>that I'm the one</i>

382
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:12.580
<i>Who understands you</i>

383
00:25:12.613 --> 00:25:18.586
<i>Been here all along</i>
<i>So, why can't you see?</i>

384
00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:23.324
<i>You belong with me</i>

385
00:25:23.357 --> 00:25:26.994
<i>Standing by</i>
<i>and waiting at your back door</i>

386
00:25:27.028 --> 00:25:28.629
<i>All this time</i>

387
00:25:28.662 --> 00:25:33.067
<i>How could</i>
<i>you not know, baby?</i>

388
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.771
<i>You belong with me</i>

389
00:25:36.804 --> 00:25:38.639
<i>You belong with me</i>

390
00:25:50.985 --> 00:25:54.622
<i>Oh, I remember you</i>
<i>driving to my house</i>

391
00:25:54.655 --> 00:25:56.157
<i>In the middle of the night</i>

392
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.992
<i>I'm the one</i>
<i>who makes you laugh</i>

393
00:25:58.025 --> 00:26:00.061
<i>When you know</i>
<i>you're 'bout to cry</i>

394
00:26:00.094 --> 00:26:01.862
<i>I know your favorite songs</i>

395
00:26:01.896 --> 00:26:03.364
<i>And you tell me</i>
<i>'bout your dreams</i>

396
00:26:03.397 --> 00:26:05.666
<i>Think I know</i>
<i>where you belong</i>

397
00:26:05.699 --> 00:26:09.070
<i>Think I know it's with me</i>

398
00:26:09.103 --> 00:26:11.939
<i>Can't you see</i>
<i>that I'm the one</i>

399
00:26:11.972 --> 00:26:12.940
<i>Who understands you?</i>

400
00:26:12.973 --> 00:26:19.380
<i>Been here all along</i>
<i>So, why can't you see?</i>

401
00:26:19.413 --> 00:26:24.218
<i>You belong with me</i>

402
00:26:24.251 --> 00:26:28.089
<i>Standing by</i>
<i>and waiting at your back door</i>

403
00:26:28.122 --> 00:26:29.657
<i>All this time</i>

404
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.961
<i>How could</i>
<i>you not know, baby?</i>

405
00:26:33.994 --> 00:26:37.898
<i>You belong with me</i>

406
00:26:37.932 --> 00:26:39.733
<i>You belong with me</i>

407
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:44.171
<i>You belong with me</i>

408
00:26:44.205 --> 00:26:49.076
<i>Have you ever thought</i>
<i>just maybe</i>

409
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.746
<i>You belong with me</i>

410
00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.181
<i>You belong with me</i>

411
00:27:27.314 --> 00:27:31.218
<i>We were both young</i>
<i>when I first saw you</i>

412
00:27:31.252 --> 00:27:34.889
<i>I close my eyes</i>
<i>and the flashback starts</i>

413
00:27:34.922 --> 00:27:36.690
<i>I'm standin' there</i>

414
00:27:38.058 --> 00:27:41.762
<i>On a balcony in summer air</i>

415
00:27:43.864 --> 00:27:45.232
<i>See the lights</i>

416
00:27:45.266 --> 00:27:47.935
<i>See the party</i>
<i>The ball gowns</i>

417
00:27:47.968 --> 00:27:51.172
<i>See you make your way</i>
<i>through the crowd</i>

418
00:27:51.205 --> 00:27:53.874
<i>And say, "Hello"</i>

419
00:27:55.075 --> 00:27:58.078
<i>Little did I know</i>

420
00:27:59.747 --> 00:28:03.717
<i>That you were Romeo</i>
<i>You were throwin' pebbles</i>

421
00:28:03.751 --> 00:28:07.054
<i>And my daddy said</i>
<i>"Stay away from Juliet"</i>

422
00:28:07.087 --> 00:28:10.057
<i>And I was cryin'</i>
<i>on the staircase</i>

423
00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:13.994
<i>Beggin' you</i>
<i>"Please don't go"</i>

424
00:28:14.795 --> 00:28:15.729
<i>And I said</i>

425
00:28:15.763 --> 00:28:20.034
<i>Romeo, take me</i>
<i>somewhere we can be alone</i>

426
00:28:20.067 --> 00:28:22.169
<i>I'll be waiting</i>

427
00:28:22.203 --> 00:28:24.171
<i>All there's left to do</i>
<i>is run</i>

428
00:28:24.205 --> 00:28:28.142
<i>You'll be the prince</i>
<i>and I'll be the princess</i>

429
00:28:28.175 --> 00:28:32.913
<i>It's a love story</i>
<i>Baby, just say, "Yes"</i>

430
00:28:35.849 --> 00:28:40.154
<i>So I sneak out</i>
<i>to the garden to see you</i>

431
00:28:40.187 --> 00:28:41.922
<i>We keep quiet</i>

432
00:28:41.956 --> 00:28:43.525
<i>'Cause we're dead</i>
<i>if they knew</i>

433
00:28:43.558 --> 00:28:45.259
<i>So close your eyes</i>

434
00:28:46.794 --> 00:28:51.966
<i>Escape this town</i>
<i>for a little while, oh oh</i>

435
00:28:51.999 --> 00:28:55.970
<i>'Cause you were Romeo</i>
<i>I was a scarlet letter</i>

436
00:28:56.003 --> 00:28:59.807
<i>And my daddy said</i>
<i>"Stay away from Juliet"</i>

437
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.009
<i>But you were everything</i>
<i>to me</i>

438
00:29:02.042 --> 00:29:06.347
<i>I was beggin' you</i>
<i>"Please don't go"</i>

439
00:29:07.014 --> 00:29:08.550
<i>And I said</i>

440
00:29:08.583 --> 00:29:12.152
<i>Romeo, take me</i>
<i>somewhere we can be alone</i>

441
00:29:12.186 --> 00:29:14.355
<i>I'll be waiting</i>

442
00:29:14.388 --> 00:29:16.223
<i>All there's left to do</i>
<i>is run</i>

443
00:29:16.257 --> 00:29:20.861
<i>You'll be the prince</i>
<i>and I'll be the princess</i>

444
00:29:20.894 --> 00:29:24.898
<i>It's a love story</i>
<i>Baby, just say, "Yes"</i>

445
00:29:24.932 --> 00:29:26.834
<i>Romeo, save me</i>

446
00:29:26.867 --> 00:29:28.969
<i>They're tryna tell me</i>
<i>how to feel</i>

447
00:29:29.003 --> 00:29:32.873
<i>This love is difficult</i>
<i>But it's real</i>

448
00:29:32.906 --> 00:29:34.174
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

449
00:29:34.208 --> 00:29:36.910
<i>We'll make it</i>
<i>out of this mess</i>

450
00:29:36.944 --> 00:29:41.181
<i>It's a love story</i>
<i>Baby, just say, "Yes"</i>

451
00:29:44.084 --> 00:29:46.820
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

452
00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.832
<i>I got tired of waiting</i>

453
00:30:00.034 --> 00:30:03.871
<i>Wonderin' if you were</i>
<i>ever comin' around</i>

454
00:30:03.904 --> 00:30:08.342
<i>My faith in you was fading</i>

455
00:30:08.375 --> 00:30:11.879
<i>When I met you</i>
<i>on the outskirts of town</i>

456
00:30:11.912 --> 00:30:12.846
<i>And I said</i>

457
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.117
<i>Romeo, save me</i>
<i>I've been feeling so alone</i>

458
00:30:17.151 --> 00:30:21.021
<i>I keep waiting for you</i>
<i>but you never come</i>

459
00:30:21.055 --> 00:30:24.458
<i>Is this in my head?</i>
<i>I don't know what to think</i>

460
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:26.628
<i>He knelt to the ground</i>

461
00:30:26.661 --> 00:30:29.263
<i>And pulled out a ring</i>
<i>And said</i>

462
00:30:29.296 --> 00:30:31.031
<i>"Marry me, Juliet</i>

463
00:30:31.065 --> 00:30:33.200
<i>"You'll never</i>
<i>have to be alone</i>

464
00:30:33.233 --> 00:30:37.071
<i>"I love you</i>
<i>and that's all I really know</i>

465
00:30:37.104 --> 00:30:41.275
<i>"I talked to your dad</i>
<i>Go pick out a white dress</i>

466
00:30:41.308 --> 00:30:47.915
<i>"It's a love story</i>
<i>Baby, just say, 'Yes'"</i>

467
00:30:48.382 --> 00:30:51.251
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

468
00:30:52.152 --> 00:30:55.356
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

469
00:30:57.191 --> 00:31:04.098
<i>'Cause we were both young</i>
<i>when I first saw you</i>

470
00:31:47.742 --> 00:31:52.312
<i>Wait for the signal</i>

471
00:31:52.346 --> 00:31:59.153
<i>And I'll meet you</i>
<i>after dark</i>

472
00:32:13.167 --> 00:32:14.001
<i>I'm like the water</i>

473
00:32:14.034 --> 00:32:16.970
<i>When your ship</i>
<i>rolled in that night</i>

474
00:32:18.573 --> 00:32:19.406
<i>Rough on the surface</i>

475
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.943
<i>But you cut through</i>
<i>like a knife</i>

476
00:32:25.112 --> 00:32:28.015
<i>And if it was</i>
<i>an open-shut case</i>

477
00:32:28.048 --> 00:32:30.518
<i>I never would've known</i>
<i>from the look on your face</i>

478
00:32:30.552 --> 00:32:34.522
<i>Lost in your current</i>
<i>like a priceless wine</i>

479
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.193
<i>The more that you say</i>
<i>The less I know</i>

480
00:32:39.226 --> 00:32:42.196
<i>Wherever you stray</i>
<i>I follow</i>

481
00:32:42.229 --> 00:32:45.199
<i>I'm begging for you</i>
<i>to take my hand</i>

482
00:32:45.232 --> 00:32:48.503
<i>Wreck my plans</i>
<i>That's my man</i>

483
00:32:48.536 --> 00:32:49.336
<i>Life was a willow</i>

484
00:32:49.369 --> 00:32:52.239
<i>And it bent</i>
<i>right to your wind</i>

485
00:32:52.272 --> 00:32:54.374
<i>Oh</i>

486
00:32:54.408 --> 00:32:58.546
<i>Head on the pillow</i>
<i>I could feel you sneaking in</i>

487
00:33:00.582 --> 00:33:03.317
<i>As if you were</i>
<i>a mythical thing</i>

488
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.420
<i>Like you were a trophy</i>
<i>or a champion ring</i>

489
00:33:06.453 --> 00:33:10.090
<i>And there was one prize</i>
<i>I'd cheat to win</i>

490
00:33:12.092 --> 00:33:15.128
<i>The more that you say</i>
<i>The less I know</i>

491
00:33:15.162 --> 00:33:18.065
<i>Wherever you stray</i>
<i>I follow</i>

492
00:33:18.098 --> 00:33:20.568
<i>I'm begging for you</i>
<i>to take my hand</i>

493
00:33:20.602 --> 00:33:24.037
<i>Wreck my plans</i>
<i>That's my man</i>

494
00:33:24.071 --> 00:33:26.641
<i>You know that my train</i>
<i>could take you home</i>

495
00:33:26.674 --> 00:33:29.243
<i>Anywhere else is hollow</i>

496
00:33:29.276 --> 00:33:32.279
<i>I'm begging for you</i>
<i>to take my hand</i>

497
00:33:32.312 --> 00:33:35.583
<i>Wreck my plans</i>
<i>That's my man</i>

498
00:33:38.553 --> 00:33:40.087
<i>Life was a willow</i>

499
00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.422
<i>And it bent</i>
<i>right to your wind</i>

500
00:33:42.456 --> 00:33:44.826
<i>Oh</i>

501
00:33:44.859 --> 00:33:48.061
<i>They count me out</i>
<i>time and time again</i>

502
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:51.131
<i>Life was a willow</i>

503
00:33:51.164 --> 00:33:54.067
<i>And it bent</i>
<i>right to your wind</i>

504
00:33:54.101 --> 00:33:56.270
<i>Oh</i>

505
00:33:56.303 --> 00:33:59.574
<i>But I come back stronger</i>
<i>than a '90s trend</i>

506
00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:26.968
<i>Wait for the signal</i>

507
00:34:27.001 --> 00:34:29.637
<i>And I'll meet you</i>
<i>after dark</i>

508
00:34:31.438 --> 00:34:36.276
<i>Show me the places where</i>

509
00:34:38.211 --> 00:34:40.615
<i>Now this is</i>
<i>an open-shut case</i>

510
00:34:40.648 --> 00:34:43.651
<i>Guess I should've known</i>
<i>from the look on your face</i>

511
00:34:43.685 --> 00:34:47.387
<i>Every bait and switch</i>
<i>was a work of art</i>

512
00:34:49.423 --> 00:34:52.326
<i>The more that you say</i>
<i>The less I know</i>

513
00:34:52.359 --> 00:34:55.262
<i>Wherever you stray</i>
<i>I follow</i>

514
00:34:55.295 --> 00:34:58.198
<i>Begging for you</i>
<i>to take my hand</i>

515
00:34:58.231 --> 00:35:00.735
<i>Wreck my plans</i>
<i>That's my man</i>

516
00:35:00.768 --> 00:35:03.671
<i>You know that my train</i>
<i>could take you home</i>

517
00:35:03.705 --> 00:35:06.708
<i>Anywhere else is hollow</i>

518
00:35:06.741 --> 00:35:09.476

<i>That's my man</i>

528
00:35:36.403 --> 00:35:38.205

529
00:35:39.406 --> 00:35:40.742
<i>That's my man</i>

530
00:35:42.309 --> 00:35:43.645
<i>Yeah, that's my man</i>

531
00:35:43.678 --> 00:35:46.446
<i>Every bait and switch</i>

532

00:35:49.316 --> 00:35:51.251

536
00:36:14.676 --> 00:36:19.479
<i>Never be so kind</i>
<i>You forget to be clever</i>

537
00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:29.657
<i>Never be so clever</i>
<i>You forget to be kind</i>

538
00:36:34.729 --> 00:36:38.265
<i>And if I didn't know better</i>

539
00:36:38.298 --> 00:36:42.603
<i>I'd think you were</i>
<i>talking to me now</i>

540
00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:47.608
<i>If I didn't know better</i>

541
00:36:50.044 --> 00:36:53.213
<i>I'd think</i>
<i>you were still around</i>

542
00:36:54.816 --> 00:36:59.721
<i>What died didn't stay dead</i>
<i>What died didn't stay dead</i>

543
00:36:59.754 --> 00:37:04.726
<i>You're alive</i>
<i>You're alive in my head</i>

544
00:37:04.759 --> 00:37:09.797
<i>What died didn't stay dead</i>
<i>What died didn't stay dead</i>

545
00:37:09.831 --> 00:37:12.633
<i>You're alive, so alive</i>

546
00:37:14.468 --> 00:37:16.771
<i>The autumn chill</i>
<i>that wakes me up</i>

547
00:37:16.804 --> 00:37:19.272
<i>You loved the amber skies</i>
<i>so much</i>

548
00:37:19.306 --> 00:37:21.341
<i>Long limbs</i>
<i>and frozen swims</i>

549
00:37:21.374 --> 00:37:24.545
<i>You'd always go past</i>
<i>where our feet could touch</i>

550
00:37:24.579 --> 00:37:26.714
<i>And I complained</i>
<i>the whole way there</i>

551
00:37:26.748 --> 00:37:29.349
<i>The car ride back</i>
<i>and up the stairs</i>

552
00:37:29.382 --> 00:37:31.719
<i>I should've</i>
<i>asked you questions</i>

553
00:37:31.753 --> 00:37:35.523
<i>I should've</i>
<i>asked you how to be</i>

554
00:37:35.556 --> 00:37:37.759
<i>Asked you</i>
<i>to write it down for me</i>

555
00:37:37.792 --> 00:37:40.695
<i>Should've kept</i>
<i>every grocery store receipt</i>

556
00:37:40.728 --> 00:37:45.398
<i>'Cause every scrap of you</i>
<i>would be taken from me</i>

557
00:37:45.432 --> 00:37:47.802
<i>Watched as you signed</i>
<i>your name Marjorie</i>

558
00:37:47.835 --> 00:37:50.872
<i>All your closets</i>
<i>of backlogged dreams</i>

559
00:37:50.905 --> 00:37:54.776
<i>And how you left them all</i>
<i>to me</i>

560
00:37:54.809 --> 00:37:59.881
<i>What died didn't stay dead</i>
<i>What died didn't stay dead</i>

561
00:37:59.914 --> 00:38:04.886
<i>You're alive</i>
<i>You're alive in my head</i>

562
00:38:04.919 --> 00:38:09.791
<i>What died didn't stay dead</i>
<i>What died didn't stay dead</i>

563
00:38:09.824 --> 00:38:12.693
<i>You're alive, so alive</i>

564
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:18.331
<i>And if I didn't</i>
<i>know better</i>

565
00:38:18.365 --> 00:38:22.670
<i>I'd think you were</i>
<i>singing to me now</i>

566
00:38:24.972 --> 00:38:27.775
<i>If I didn't know better</i>

567
00:38:30.144 --> 00:38:32.747
<i>I'd think</i>
<i>you were still around</i>

568
00:38:35.448 --> 00:38:38.385
<i>I know better</i>

569
00:38:38.418 --> 00:38:42.590
<i>But I still feel you</i>
<i>all around</i>

570
00:38:45.458 --> 00:38:47.595
<i>I know better</i>

571
00:38:49.764 --> 00:38:51.899
<i>But you're still around</i>

572
00:39:20.828 --> 00:39:24.799
<i>You know, this...</i>
<i>this tour,</i>

573
00:39:24.832 --> 00:39:26.167
<i>the fact that this is</i>

574
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.604
<i>the last city</i>
<i>on the U.S. tour...</i>

575
00:39:29.637 --> 00:39:31.839
<i>It is...</i>

576
00:39:31.873 --> 00:39:34.742
<i>It is so, so many things</i>
<i>for me, because this has been</i>

577
00:39:34.775 --> 00:39:38.411
<i>the most extraordinary</i>
<i>experience</i>
<i>of my entire life.</i>

578
00:39:38.445 --> 00:39:39.614
<i>Being on this tour,</i>

579
00:39:39.647 --> 00:39:41.749
<i>getting to share these moments</i>
<i>with you.</i>

580
00:39:44.919 --> 00:39:46.621
<i>I know you're supposed to,</i>
<i>like, play it cool.</i>

581
00:39:46.654 --> 00:39:47.487
<i>You're supposed to be like,</i>

582
00:39:47.521 --> 00:39:48.756
<i>"Oh, I like you guys</i>
<i>a little bit."</i>

583
00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:49.991
<i>But genuinely,</i>

584
00:39:50.024 --> 00:39:52.627
<i>this has meant more to me</i>
<i>than anything I've ever done</i>

585
00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.930
<i>or been a part of in my life.</i>
<i>This tour. So...</i>

586
00:40:04.872 --> 00:40:05.673
<i>Ah.</i>

587
00:40:05.706 --> 00:40:08.542
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>before this tour,</i>

588
00:40:08.576 --> 00:40:10.044
<i>I would... I would go</i>
<i>through this process</i>

589
00:40:10.077 --> 00:40:11.779
<i>where I'd make an album,</i>

590
00:40:11.812 --> 00:40:13.814
<i>and I'd call the album</i>
<i>something like</i>

591
00:40:13.848 --> 00:40:17.218
Red <i>or</i> Speak Now <i>or</i> Fearless
<i>or, you know.</i>

592
00:40:17.251 --> 00:40:18.485
<i>And then I'd go,</i>

593
00:40:18.519 --> 00:40:21.522
<i>I'd put together a tour called</i>
<i>the name of that album, right?</i>

594
00:40:21.555 --> 00:40:24.025
<i>Like the</i> 1989 <i>tour,</i>
Speak Now <i>tour.</i>

595
00:40:24.058 --> 00:40:25.893
<i>And we'd do it like that.</i>

596
00:40:25.927 --> 00:40:27.929
<i>And I remember like,</i>

597
00:40:27.962 --> 00:40:31.666
<i>why am I just do...</i>
<i>What is this...?</i>

598
00:40:31.699 --> 00:40:34.602
<i>Why?</i>

599
00:40:34.635 --> 00:40:37.738
<i>Anyway, um,</i>
<i>so with this tour,</i>

600
00:40:37.772 --> 00:40:39.140
<i>I remember people</i>
<i>would come up to me</i>

601
00:40:39.173 --> 00:40:41.809
<i>and they'd be like,</i>
<i>"So you've put out,</i>
<i>like, five albums</i>

602
00:40:41.842 --> 00:40:43.044
<i>"that you haven't</i>
<i>done tours for.</i>

603
00:40:43.077 --> 00:40:44.979
<i>"So what's your plan? Like,</i>
<i>what are you going to do?</i>

604
00:40:45.012 --> 00:40:47.548
<i>"You're going to just,</i>
<i>like, do a show</i>

605
00:40:47.581 --> 00:40:49.717
<i>"with, like,</i>
<i>all the albums in it</i>

606
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:50.751
<i>"and it'll be like, what?</i>

607
00:40:50.785 --> 00:40:53.020
<i>"Like, a three-and-a-half</i>
<i>hour long show?"</i>

608
00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:03.965
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, it's...</i>

609
00:41:03.998 --> 00:41:07.268
<i>"it's going to be called</i>
<i>The Eras Tour.</i>
<i>See you there."</i>

610
00:41:12.173 --> 00:41:18.779
<i>So we are currently</i>
<i>in the</i> evermore <i>Era and, um...</i>

611
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.919
<i>and that was my second</i>
<i>pandemic album that I made.</i>

612
00:41:24.952 --> 00:41:30.558
<i>And I remember there was...</i>
<i>There was one specific song</i>

613
00:41:30.591 --> 00:41:33.661
<i>where after I wrote it</i>
<i>I thought, you know,</i>

614
00:41:33.694 --> 00:41:36.597
<i>that would be</i>
<i>a really cathartic</i>
<i>experience,</i>

615
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:39.767
<i>I'm sure, to get</i>
<i>to sing</i> Champagne Problems

616
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.902
<i>in a stadium, you know?</i>

617
00:41:45.606 --> 00:41:46.607
<i>So let's do it.</i>

618
00:42:07.862 --> 00:42:11.899
<i>You booked the night train</i>
<i>for a reason</i>

619
00:42:11.932 --> 00:42:16.070
<i>So you could sit there</i>
<i>in this hurt</i>

620
00:42:18.939 --> 00:42:23.044
<i>Bustling crowds</i>
<i>or silent sleepers</i>

621
00:42:23.077 --> 00:42:27.948
<i>You're not sure</i>
<i>which is worse</i>

622
00:42:27.982 --> 00:42:32.086
<i>Because I dropped your hand</i>
<i>while dancing</i>

623
00:42:32.119 --> 00:42:36.957
<i>Left you out there standing</i>
<i>Crestfallen on the landing</i>

624
00:42:36.991 --> 00:42:39.794
<i>Champagne problems</i>

625
00:42:39.827 --> 00:42:42.763
<i>Your mom's ring</i>
<i>in your pocket</i>

626
00:42:42.797 --> 00:42:45.599
<i>My picture in your wallet</i>

627
00:42:45.633 --> 00:42:47.935
<i>Your heart was glass</i>
<i>I dropped it</i>

628
00:42:47.968 --> 00:42:50.805
<i>Champagne problems</i>

629
00:43:02.083 --> 00:43:05.586
<i>You told your family</i>
<i>for a reason</i>

630
00:43:06.887 --> 00:43:10.591
<i>You couldn't keep it in</i>

631
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.664
<i>Your sister splashed out</i>
<i>on the bottle</i>

632
00:43:17.231 --> 00:43:22.136
<i>Now no one's celebrating</i>

633
00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:26.107
<i>Dom Pérignon, you brought it</i>

634
00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.776
<i>No crowd of friends</i>
<i>applauded</i>

635
00:43:28.809 --> 00:43:31.011
<i>Your hometown skeptics</i>
<i>called it</i>

636
00:43:31.045 --> 00:43:34.148
<i>Champagne problems</i>

637
00:43:34.181 --> 00:43:36.984
<i>You had a speech</i>
<i>You're speechless</i>

638
00:43:37.017 --> 00:43:39.653
<i>Love slipped</i>
<i>beyond your reaches</i>

639
00:43:39.687 --> 00:43:41.989
<i>And I couldn't</i>
<i>give a reason</i>

640
00:43:42.022 --> 00:43:44.258
<i>Champagne problems</i>

641
00:44:07.047 --> 00:44:09.683
<i>Your Midas touch</i>
<i>on the Chevy door</i>

642
00:44:09.717 --> 00:44:12.153
<i>November flush</i>
<i>and your flannel cure</i>

643
00:44:12.186 --> 00:44:14.288
<i>"This dorm was</i>
<i>once a madhouse"</i>

644
00:44:14.321 --> 00:44:16.991
<i>I made a joke</i>
<i>"Well, it's made for me"</i>

645
00:44:17.024 --> 00:44:20.194
<i>How evergreen</i>
<i>Our group of friends</i>

646
00:44:20.227 --> 00:44:22.997
<i>Don't think</i>
<i>we'll say that word again</i>

647
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:26.467
<i>And soon they'll have</i>
<i>the nerve to deck the halls</i>

648
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.002
<i>That we once walked through</i>

649
00:44:28.035 --> 00:44:30.771
<i>One for the money</i>
<i>Two for the show</i>

650
00:44:30.804 --> 00:44:33.073
<i>I never was ready</i>
<i>so I watch you go</i>

651
00:44:33.107 --> 00:44:35.809
<i>Sometimes you just</i>
<i>don't know the answer</i>

652
00:44:35.843 --> 00:44:38.779
<i>Till someone's</i>
<i>on their knees and asks you</i>

653
00:44:38.812 --> 00:44:41.248
<i>"She would've made</i>
<i>such a lovely bride</i>

654
00:44:41.282 --> 00:44:44.051
<i>"What a shame she's fucked</i>
<i>in the head," they said</i>

655
00:44:44.084 --> 00:44:46.720
<i>But you'll find</i>
<i>the real thing instead</i>

656
00:44:46.754 --> 00:44:49.823
<i>She'll patch up</i>
<i>your tapestry that I shred</i>

657
00:44:49.857 --> 00:44:52.993
<i>And hold your hand</i>
<i>while dancing</i>

658
00:44:53.027 --> 00:44:58.065
<i>Never leave you standing</i>
<i>Crestfallen on the landing</i>

659
00:44:58.098 --> 00:45:00.868
<i>With champagne problems</i>

660
00:45:00.901 --> 00:45:03.771
<i>Your mom's ring</i>
<i>in your pocket</i>

661

<i>Her picture in your wallet</i>

662
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:11.879
<i>You won't remember all my</i>

663
00:45:17.552 --> 00:45:22.856
<i>You won't remember all my</i>

664
00:46:47.074 --> 00:46:49.209
<i>That's a very generous thing</i>

665
00:46:49.243 --> 00:46:51.613
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

666
00:46:51.646 --> 00:46:52.880
<i>Ah.</i>

667
00:48:33.548 --> 00:48:40.020
<i>I sit and watch you</i>

668
00:48:41.523 --> 00:48:43.525
<i>I wake and watch you</i>

669
00:48:43.558 --> 00:48:48.262
<i>Breathing</i>

670
00:48:49.496 --> 00:48:53.033

671
00:48:53.066 --> 00:48:58.740
<i>I notice everything</i>

672
00:48:58.773 --> 00:49:03.578
<i>You're so much older</i>

673
00:49:03.611 --> 00:49:08.482
<i>I wait by the door</i>

674
00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:13.220
<i>Use my best colors</i>

675
00:49:14.488 --> 00:49:17.958
<i>Lay the table</i>

676
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.429

678

679
00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:34.609
<i>I know my love</i>

680
00:49:34.642 --> 00:49:38.245
<i>But you tolerate it</i>

681
00:49:38.278 --> 00:49:41.616
<i>While you were out building</i>

682
00:49:41.649 --> 00:49:42.617
<i>Where's that man</i>

683
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:46.186
<i>Who'd throw blankets</i>
<i>over my barbed wire?</i>

684
00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:50.457
<i>I made you my temple</i>
<i>My mural, my sky</i>

685
00:49:50.491 --> 00:49:52.459
<i>Now I'm begging</i>

<i>Always taking up</i>

689
00:50:02.135 --> 00:50:07.207
<i>You assume I'm fine</i>
<i>But what would you do if I</i>

690
00:50:10.377 --> 00:50:14.047
<i>Break free</i>
<i>and leave us in ruins</i>

691
00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:17.251
<i>Took this dagger in me</i>
<i>and removed it</i>

692
00:50:18.653 --> 00:50:23.056
<i>Gain the weight of you</i>
<i>Then lose it</i>

693
00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:26.628
<i>Believe me, I could do it</i>

694
00:50:26.661 --> 00:50:29.429
<i>If it's all in my head</i>
<i>Tell me now</i>

695

<i>Knew he was a killer</i>

700
00:51:49.476 --> 00:51:50.578
<i>Wondered how many girls</i>

701
00:51:50.612 --> 00:51:52.479
<i>He had loved</i>
<i>and left haunted</i>

702
00:51:52.513 --> 00:51:55.516
<i>But if he's a ghost</i>
<i>Then I can be a phantom</i>

<i>Younger than my exes</i>

707
00:52:02.155 --> 00:52:04.424
<i>But he act</i>

708
00:52:04.458 --> 00:52:05.359
<i>I see nothing better</i>

709
00:52:05.392 --> 00:52:09.731
<i>I keep him forever</i>
<i>Like a vendetta-ta</i>

<i>But if I'm a thief</i>

724
00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:01.415

725
00:53:01.448 --> 00:53:03.651
<i>We'll move</i>

726
00:53:03.685 --> 00:53:07.387

727
00:53:07.421 --> 00:53:10.424
<i>Every love I've known</i>
<i>in comparison is a failure</i>

834
00:58:30.911 --> 00:58:33.014

857

862
01:00:12.146 --> 01:00:16.016
<i>I would lose my mind</i>

863
01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:19.220

995
01:07:40.728 --> 01:07:43.631
<i>The playful</i>
<i>conversation starts</i>

996
01:07:43.665 --> 01:07:46.601
<i>Counter all</i>
<i>your quick remarks</i>

997
01:07:46.634 --> 01:07:51.171
<i>Like passing notes</i>
<i>in secrecy</i>

998
01:07:51.606 --> 01:07:53.708
<i>And it was</i>

999
01:07:53.741 --> 01:08:00.447
<i>Enchanting to meet you</i>

1000
01:08:01.916 --> 01:08:05.553
<i>All I can say is I was</i>

1001
01:08:05.587 --> 01:08:12.594
<i>Enchanted to meet you</i>

1002
01:08:16.764 --> 01:08:22.670
<i>This night is sparklin'</i>
<i>Don't you let it go</i>

1003
01:08:22.704 --> 01:08:28.543
<i>I'm wonderstruck</i>
<i>Blushin' all the way home</i>

1004
01:08:28.576 --> 01:08:34.381
<i>I'll spend forever</i>
<i>wonderin' if you knew</i>

1005
01:08:34.414 --> 01:08:41.421
<i>I was enchanted to meet you</i>

1006
01:09:00.374 --> 01:09:03.511
<i>This is me praying that</i>

1007
01:09:03.544 --> 01:09:06.213
<i>This was the very first page</i>

1008
01:09:06.246 --> 01:09:09.550
<i>Not where the storyline ends</i>

1009
01:09:09.584 --> 01:09:12.185
<i>My thoughts</i>
<i>will echo your name</i>

1010
01:09:12.219 --> 01:09:14.956
<i>Until I see you again</i>

1011
01:09:14.989 --> 01:09:17.959
<i>These are the words</i>
<i>I held back</i>

1012
01:09:17.992 --> 01:09:21.194
<i>As I was leaving too soon</i>

1013
01:09:21.228 --> 01:09:26.534
<i>I was enchanted</i>
<i>to meet you</i>

1014
01:09:26.567 --> 01:09:32.507
<i>Please, don't be in love</i>
<i>with someone else</i>

1015
01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:38.278
<i>Please, don't have</i>
<i>somebody waiting on you</i>

1016
01:09:38.311 --> 01:09:44.217
<i>Please, don't be in love</i>
<i>with someone else</i>

1017
01:09:44.251 --> 01:09:50.692
<i>Please, don't have</i>
<i>somebody waiting on you</i>

1018
01:09:50.725 --> 01:09:56.463
<i>This night is sparklin'</i>
<i>Don't you let it go</i>

1019
01:09:56.496 --> 01:10:02.570
<i>I'm wonderstruck</i>
<i>Blushin' all the way home</i>

1020
01:10:02.603 --> 01:10:05.840
<i>I'll spend forever</i>

1021
01:10:05.873 --> 01:10:11.344
<i>Wonderin' if you knew</i>

1022
01:10:14.281 --> 01:10:19.854
<i>This night is flawless</i>
<i>Don't you let it go</i>

1023
01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:25.760
<i>I'm wonderstruck</i>
<i>Dancing around all alone</i>

1024
01:10:25.793 --> 01:10:31.465
<i>I'll spend forever</i>
<i>wonderin' if you knew</i>

1025
01:10:31.498 --> 01:10:36.838
<i>I was enchanted to meet you</i>

1026
01:10:36.871 --> 01:10:39.507
<i>Please, don't be in love</i>

1027
01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:42.643
<i>With someone else</i>

1028
01:10:42.677 --> 01:10:48.683
<i>Please, don't have</i>
<i>somebody waiting on you</i>

1029
01:11:11.606 --> 01:11:14.075
<i>It feels like</i>
<i>a perfect night</i>

1030
01:11:14.108 --> 01:11:16.309
<i>To dress up like hipsters</i>

1031
01:11:16.343 --> 01:11:18.646
<i>And make fun of our exes</i>

1032
01:11:18.679 --> 01:11:20.815
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

1033
01:11:20.848 --> 01:11:23.518
<i>It feels like</i>
<i>a perfect night</i>

1034
01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:25.520
<i>For breakfast at midnight</i>

1035
01:11:25.553 --> 01:11:28.421
<i>To fall in love with strangers</i>

1036
01:11:28.455 --> 01:11:30.357
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

1037
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:32.392
<i>Yeah</i>

1038
01:11:32.425 --> 01:11:34.394
<i>We're happy, free</i>
<i>Confused and lonely</i>

1039
01:11:34.427 --> 01:11:36.531
<i>At the same time</i>

1040
01:11:36.564 --> 01:11:38.733
<i>It's miserable and magical</i>

1041
01:11:38.766 --> 01:11:40.902
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1042
01:11:40.935 --> 01:11:42.537
<i>Tonight's the night</i>

1043
01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:45.405
<i>When we forget</i>
<i>about the deadlines</i>

1044
01:11:45.438 --> 01:11:47.775
<i>It's time</i>

1045
01:11:47.809 --> 01:11:49.376
<i>Ah, ah</i>

1046
01:11:49.409 --> 01:11:50.711
<i>I don't know about you</i>

1047
01:11:50.745 --> 01:11:53.648
<i>But I'm feeling 22</i>

1048
01:11:53.681 --> 01:11:55.817
<i>Everything</i>
<i>will be all right if</i>

1049
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:58.753
<i>You keep me next to you</i>

1050
01:11:58.786 --> 01:12:00.420
<i>You don't know about me</i>

1051
01:12:00.453 --> 01:12:02.790
<i>But I'll bet you want to</i>

1052
01:12:02.824 --> 01:12:05.126
<i>Everything</i>
<i>will be all right if</i>

1053
01:12:05.159 --> 01:12:08.129
<i>We just keep dancing</i>
<i>like we're</i>

1054
01:12:08.162 --> 01:12:11.599
<i>22</i>

1055
01:12:12.733 --> 01:12:16.137
<i>22</i>

1056
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:18.606
<i>It feels like</i>
<i>one of those nights</i>

1057
01:12:18.639 --> 01:12:20.808
<i>This place is too crowded</i>

1058
01:12:20.842 --> 01:12:22.910
<i>Too many cool kids</i>

1059
01:12:22.944 --> 01:12:25.378
<i>"Who is Taylor Swift</i>
<i>anyway? Ew"</i>

1060
01:12:25.412 --> 01:12:28.448
<i>It seems like</i>
<i>one of those nights</i>

1061
01:12:28.481 --> 01:12:30.450
<i>We ditch the whole scene</i>

1062
01:12:30.483 --> 01:12:34.622
<i>And end up dreaming</i>
<i>instead of sleeping</i>

1063
01:12:34.655 --> 01:12:36.591
<i>Yeah</i>

1064
01:12:36.624 --> 01:12:38.960
<i>We're happy, free</i>
<i>Confused and lonely</i>

1065
01:12:38.993 --> 01:12:41.596
<i>In the best way</i>

1066
01:12:41.629 --> 01:12:43.598
<i>It's miserable and magical</i>

1067
01:12:43.631 --> 01:12:45.766
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1068
01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.667
<i>Tonight's the night</i>

1069
01:12:46.701 --> 01:12:49.871
<i>When we forget</i>
<i>about the heartbreaks</i>

1070
01:12:49.904 --> 01:12:51.939
<i>It's time</i>

1071
01:12:51.973 --> 01:12:53.040
<i>Ah, ah</i>

1072
01:12:53.074 --> 01:12:55.475
<i>-Hey!</i>

01:15:07.041 --> 01:15:08.909
<i>Saying, "This is it</i>
<i>I've had enough"</i>

<i>We hadn't seen each other</i>
<i>in a month</i>

1120
01:15:12.079 --> 01:15:15.716
<i>When you said</i>
<i>you needed space, what?</i>

1121
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:17.952
<i>Then you come around again</i>
<i>and say</i>

1122
01:15:17.985 --> 01:15:20.121
<i>"Baby, I miss you</i>
<i>and I swear I'm gonna change</i>

1125
01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.559
<i>I say, "I hate you"</i>
<i>We break up</i>

1126
01:15:25.593 --> 01:15:26.994
<i>You call me, "I love you"</i>

01:15:27.028 --> 01:15:29.764
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

1128
01:15:29.797 --> 01:15:32.666

<i>And me falling for it</i>
<i>Screaming that I'm right</i>

1139
01:16:10.905 --> 01:16:13.674
<i>And you would hide away</i>
<i>and find your peace of mind</i>

1140
01:16:13.707 --> 01:16:17.078
<i>With some indie record</i>
<i>that's much cooler than mine</i>

1141

<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

1142
01:16:19.947 --> 01:16:22.817
<i>You called me up again</i>

01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:25.619
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

1144
01:16:25.653 --> 01:16:28.155
<i>This time, I'm telling you</i>

1147
01:16:39.433 --> 01:16:41.702
<i>You go talk</i>
<i>to your friends</i>

1148
01:16:41.735 --> 01:16:43.871
<i>Talk to my friends</i>
<i>Talk to me</i>

1149
01:16:43.904 --> 01:16:45.072
<i>You talk to me</i>

1150
01:16:45.106 --> 01:16:51.846
<i>But we are never ever ever</i>
<i>ever getting back together</i>

1151
01:16:51.879 --> 01:16:53.714
<i>-Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>
<i>-Yeah</i>

<i>Oh, no</i>

1155
01:17:02.022 --> 01:17:06.994
<i>I used to think</i>
<i>that we were forever ever</i>

1156
01:17:07.027 --> 01:17:13.434
<i>And I used to say</i>
<i>never say never</i>

1157
01:17:13.467 --> 01:17:14.301
<i>So he calls me up</i>

1158
01:17:14.335 --> 01:17:15.903
<i>And he's like</i>
<i>"I still love you"</i>

1159
01:17:15.936 --> 01:17:17.171
<i>And I'm like, I'm just</i>

1160
01:17:17.204 --> 01:17:19.140
<i>I mean this is exhausting</i>
<i>You know?</i>

1161
01:17:19.173 --> 01:17:21.041
<i>Like, we are never</i>
<i>getting back together</i>

1162
01:17:21.075 --> 01:17:23.043
<i>Like, ever</i>

1163
01:17:23.077 --> 01:17:25.079
<i>No</i>

1164
01:17:25.112 --> 01:17:27.781
<i>We are never ever ever</i>

1165
01:17:27.815 --> 01:17:29.283
<i>Getting back together</i>

1166
01:17:29.316 --> 01:17:32.052
<i>We are never ever ever</i>

1167
01:17:32.086 --> 01:17:35.022
<i>-Oh</i>
<i>-Getting back together</i>

1168
01:17:35.055 --> 01:17:36.991
<i>You go talk to your friends</i>

1169
01:17:37.024 --> 01:17:40.027
<i>Talk to my friends</i>
<i>Talk to me</i>

1170
01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:42.129
<i>But we are</i>

1171
01:17:42.163 --> 01:17:47.168
<i>Never ever ever ever</i>
<i>getting back together</i>

1172
01:17:47.201 --> 01:17:49.770
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

1173
01:17:49.803 --> 01:17:51.739
<i>-No</i>
<i>-Getting back together</i>

1174
01:17:51.772 --> 01:17:52.973
<i>We</i>

1175
01:17:53.007 --> 01:17:54.775
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

1176
01:17:54.808 --> 01:17:57.178
<i>No, no</i>

1177
01:17:57.211 --> 01:17:59.480
<i>You go talk to your friends</i>

1178
01:17:59.514 --> 01:18:02.816
<i>Talk to my friends</i>
<i>talk to me</i>

1179
01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:09.290
<i>But we are never ever ever</i>
<i>ever getting back together</i>

1180
01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:22.236
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>A few mistakes ago</i>

1181
01:18:22.269 --> 01:18:25.339
<i>I was in your sights</i>
<i>You got me alone</i>

1182
01:18:25.372 --> 01:18:31.513
<i>You found me, you found me</i>
<i>You found me</i>

1183
01:18:31.546 --> 01:18:34.915
<i>I guess you didn't care</i>
<i>and I guess I liked that</i>

1184
01:18:34.949 --> 01:18:38.052
<i>And when I fell hard</i>
<i>You took a step back</i>

1185
01:18:38.085 --> 01:18:45.259
<i>Without me, without me</i>
<i>Without me</i>

1186
01:18:45.292 --> 01:18:51.999
<i>And he's long gone</i>
<i>when he's next to me</i>

1187
01:18:52.032 --> 01:18:56.971
<i>And I realize</i>
<i>the blame is on me</i>

1188
01:18:57.004 --> 01:19:01.108
<i>'Cause I knew you were</i>
<i>trouble when you walked in</i>

1189
01:19:01.141 --> 01:19:03.344
<i>So shame on me now</i>

1190
01:19:03.377 --> 01:19:07.781
<i>Flew me to places</i>
<i>I'd never been</i>

1191
01:19:07.815 --> 01:19:09.283
<i>Till you put me down, oh</i>

1192
01:19:09.316 --> 01:19:13.887
<i>I knew you were trouble</i>
<i>when you walked in</i>

1193
01:19:13.921 --> 01:19:16.123
<i>So shame on me now</i>

1194
01:19:16.156 --> 01:19:19.994
<i>Flew me to places</i>
<i>I'd never been</i>

1195
01:19:20.027 --> 01:19:22.830
<i>Now I'm lying</i>
<i>on the cold hard ground</i>

1196
01:19:22.863 --> 01:19:25.866
<i>Oh, oh-oh</i>

1197
01:19:25.899 --> 01:19:28.102
<i>Trouble, trouble, trouble</i>

1198
01:19:28.869 --> 01:19:32.139
<i>Oh, oh-oh</i>

1199
01:19:32.172 --> 01:19:34.041
<i>Trouble, trouble, trouble</i>

1200
01:19:34.074 --> 01:19:36.176
<i>And the saddest fear</i>

1201
01:19:37.111 --> 01:19:39.280
<i>Comes creeping in</i>

1202
01:19:40.214 --> 01:19:42.416
<i>That you never loved me</i>

1203
01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:46.854
<i>Or her, or anyone, or anything</i>

1204
01:19:46.887 --> 01:19:50.357
<i>-Yeah</i>
<i>-I knew you were trouble</i>

1205
01:19:50.391 --> 01:19:52.893
<i>When you walked in</i>

1206
01:19:52.926 --> 01:19:54.895
<i>So shame on me now</i>

1207
01:19:54.928 --> 01:19:57.998
<i>Flew me to places</i>
<i>I'd never been</i>

1208
01:19:58.032 --> 01:19:59.033
<i>Never been</i>

1209
01:19:59.066 --> 01:20:00.367
<i>Till you put me down, oh</i>

1210
01:20:00.401 --> 01:20:04.204
<i>I knew you were trouble</i>
<i>when you walked in</i>

1211
01:20:04.238 --> 01:20:07.308
<i>Knew it right there</i>
<i>Knew it right there</i>

1212
01:20:07.341 --> 01:20:11.312
<i>-Flew me to places</i>
<i>-I'd never been</i>

1213
01:20:11.345 --> 01:20:14.148
<i>Now I'm lying</i>
<i>on the cold hard ground</i>

1214
01:20:14.181 --> 01:20:17.017
<i>Oh, oh-oh</i>

1215
01:20:17.051 --> 01:20:18.919
<i>Trouble, trouble</i>

1216
01:20:18.952 --> 01:20:20.321
<i>-Trouble</i>
<i>-Trouble</i>

1217
01:20:20.354 --> 01:20:23.457
<i>Oh, oh-oh</i>

1218
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:25.459
<i>Trouble, trouble, trouble</i>

1219
01:20:25.492 --> 01:20:29.930
<i>I knew you were trouble</i>
<i>when you walked in</i>

1220
01:20:29.963 --> 01:20:32.032
<i>Trouble, trouble, trouble</i>

1221
01:20:32.066 --> 01:20:35.936
<i>I knew you were trouble</i>
<i>when you walked in</i>

1222
01:20:35.969 --> 01:20:38.272
<i>Trouble, trouble, trouble</i>

1223
01:20:59.993 --> 01:21:02.963
<i>L.A., are you enjoying</i>
<i>the</i> Red <i>Era so far?</i>

1224
01:21:09.503 --> 01:21:10.371
<i>Oh, good.</i>
<i>I'm glad to hear it,</i>

1225
01:21:10.404 --> 01:21:13.107
<i>'cause there...</i>
<i>There is one more song</i>

1226
01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:16.977
<i>that I was wanting to play you</i>
<i>from the</i> Red <i>album...</i>

1227
01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:18.479
<i>Um...</i>

1228
01:21:21.716 --> 01:21:24.385
<i>If you happen to have</i>
<i>about 10 minutes to spare?</i>

1229
01:21:49.243 --> 01:21:52.246
<i>I walked through</i>
<i>the door with you</i>

1230
01:21:52.279 --> 01:21:54.415
<i>The air was cold</i>

1231
01:21:54.448 --> 01:21:58.720
<i>But something 'bout it</i>
<i>felt like home somehow</i>

1232
01:21:58.753 --> 01:22:04.091
<i>And I left my scarf there</i>
<i>at your sister's house</i>

1233
01:22:04.124 --> 01:22:10.364
<i>And you've still got it</i>
<i>in your drawer, even now</i>

1234
01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:25.312
<i>Oh, your sweet disposition</i>
<i>and my wide-eyed gaze</i>

1235
01:22:25.345 --> 01:22:31.018
<i>We're singing in the car</i>
<i>Getting lost upstate</i>

1236
01:22:31.051 --> 01:22:35.122
<i>Autumn leaves falling down</i>
<i>like pieces into place</i>

1237
01:22:35.155 --> 01:22:40.994
<i>And I can picture it</i>
<i>after all these days</i>

1238
01:22:41.028 --> 01:22:43.330
<i>And I know</i>
<i>it's long gone and</i>

1239
01:22:43.363 --> 01:22:46.099
<i>That magic's not here</i>
<i>no more</i>

1240
01:22:46.133 --> 01:22:47.769
<i>And I might be okay</i>

1241
01:22:47.802 --> 01:22:51.338
<i>But I'm not fine at all</i>

1242
01:22:51.371 --> 01:22:56.343
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1243
01:22:56.376 --> 01:23:01.448
<i>'Cause there we are again</i>
<i>on that little town street</i>

1244
01:23:01.482 --> 01:23:03.383
<i>You almost ran the red</i>

1245
01:23:03.417 --> 01:23:06.086
<i>'Cause you were</i>
<i>lookin' over at me</i>

1246
01:23:06.119 --> 01:23:08.489
<i>Wind in my hair, I was there</i>

1247
01:23:08.523 --> 01:23:14.461
<i>I remember it</i>
<i>all too well</i>

1248
01:23:17.064 --> 01:23:22.069
<i>Photo album on the counter</i>
<i>Your cheeks were turning red</i>

1249
01:23:22.102 --> 01:23:23.370
<i>You used to be a little kid</i>

1250
01:23:23.403 --> 01:23:27.374
<i>With glasses</i>
<i>in a twin-sized bed</i>

1251
01:23:27.407 --> 01:23:30.310
<i>Your mother's telling</i>
<i>stories 'bout you</i>

1252
01:23:30.344 --> 01:23:32.647
<i>On the tee-ball team</i>

1253
01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:34.516
<i>You taught me 'bout your past</i>

1254
01:23:34.549 --> 01:23:37.317
<i>Thinking your future</i>
<i>was me</i>

1255
01:23:37.351 --> 01:23:40.053
<i>And you were tossing me</i>
<i>the car keys</i>

1256
01:23:40.087 --> 01:23:41.488
<i>"Fuck the patriarchy"</i>

1257
01:23:41.523 --> 01:23:44.324
<i>Keychain on the ground</i>

1258
01:23:44.358 --> 01:23:47.427
<i>We were always</i>
<i>skipping town</i>

1259
01:23:47.461 --> 01:23:50.397
<i>And I was thinking</i>
<i>on the drive down</i>

1260
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:54.368
<i>Any time now</i>
<i>He's gonna say it's love</i>

1261
01:23:54.401 --> 01:23:57.572
<i>You never called it</i>
<i>what it was</i>

1262
01:23:57.605 --> 01:24:00.608
<i>Till we were dead and gone</i>
<i>and buried</i>

1263
01:24:00.642 --> 01:24:02.510
<i>Check the pulse and come back</i>

1264
01:24:02.544 --> 01:24:05.112
<i>Swearing it's the same</i>

1265
01:24:05.145 --> 01:24:08.282
<i>After three months</i>
<i>in the grave</i>

1266
01:24:08.315 --> 01:24:11.151
<i>And then you wondered</i>
<i>where it went to</i>

1267
01:24:11.184 --> 01:24:12.554
<i>As I reached for you</i>

1268
01:24:12.587 --> 01:24:15.289
<i>But all I felt was shame</i>

1269
01:24:15.322 --> 01:24:18.425
<i>And you held</i>
<i>my lifeless frame</i>

1270
01:24:18.458 --> 01:24:21.563
<i>And I know</i>
<i>it's long gone and</i>

1271
01:24:21.596 --> 01:24:24.298
<i>There was nothing else</i>
<i>I could do</i>

1272
01:24:24.331 --> 01:24:26.868
<i>And I forget about you</i>
<i>long enough</i>

1273
01:24:26.901 --> 01:24:35.108
<i>To forget why I needed to</i>

1274
01:24:35.142 --> 01:24:40.180
<i>'Cause there we are again</i>
<i>in the middle of the night</i>

1275
01:24:40.213 --> 01:24:41.649
<i>We're dancing</i>
<i>'round the kitchen</i>

1276
01:24:41.683 --> 01:24:44.318
<i>In the refrigerator light</i>

1277
01:24:44.351 --> 01:24:46.888
<i>Down the stairs, I was there</i>

1278
01:24:46.921 --> 01:24:53.427
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1279
01:24:55.362 --> 01:25:00.602
<i>And there we are again</i>
<i>when nobody had to know</i>

1280
01:25:00.635 --> 01:25:04.906
<i>You kept me like a secret</i>
<i>but I kept you like an oath</i>

1281
01:25:04.939 --> 01:25:07.508
<i>Sacred prayer and we'd swear</i>

1282
01:25:07.542 --> 01:25:09.510
<i>To remember it</i>

1283
01:25:09.544 --> 01:25:16.383
<i>All too well, yeah</i>

1284
01:25:30.665 --> 01:25:33.735
<i>Well, maybe we got</i>
<i>lost in translation</i>

1285
01:25:33.768 --> 01:25:36.236
<i>Maybe I asked for too much</i>

1286
01:25:36.269 --> 01:25:39.306
<i>But maybe this thing</i>
<i>was a masterpiece</i>

1287
01:25:39.339 --> 01:25:41.241
<i>Till you tore it all up</i>

1288
01:25:41.274 --> 01:25:44.244
<i>Running scared, I was there</i>

1289
01:25:44.277 --> 01:25:51.552
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1290
01:25:51.586 --> 01:25:54.321
<i>And you call me up again</i>

1291
01:25:54.354 --> 01:25:57.391
<i>Just to break me</i>
<i>like a promise</i>

1292
01:25:57.424 --> 01:26:01.796
<i>So casually cruel in</i>
<i>the name of "being honest"</i>

1293
01:26:01.829 --> 01:26:05.767
<i>I'm a crumpled up</i>
<i>piece of paper lying here</i>

1294
01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:12.540
<i>'Cause I remember it</i>
<i>all, all, all</i>

1295
01:26:12.573 --> 01:26:15.510
<i>They say all's well</i>
<i>that ends well</i>

1296
01:26:15.543 --> 01:26:17.679
<i>But I'm in a new hell</i>

1297
01:26:17.712 --> 01:26:22.650
<i>Every time</i>
<i>you double-cross my mind</i>

1298
01:26:22.684 --> 01:26:26.554
<i>You said if we had</i>
<i>been closer in age</i>

1299
01:26:26.587 --> 01:26:30.290
<i>Maybe it would have been fine</i>

1300
01:26:30.323 --> 01:26:33.460
<i>And that made me want to die</i>

1301
01:26:33.493 --> 01:26:36.463
<i>The idea you had of me</i>
<i>Who was she?</i>

1302
01:26:36.496 --> 01:26:39.834
<i>A never-needy</i>
<i>ever-lovely jewel</i>

1303
01:26:39.867 --> 01:26:43.638
<i>Whose shine reflects on you</i>

1304
01:26:43.671 --> 01:26:46.440
<i>Not weeping</i>
<i>in a party bathroom</i>

1305
01:26:46.473 --> 01:26:50.545
<i>Some actress asking me</i>
<i>what happened, you</i>

1306
01:26:50.578 --> 01:26:54.314
<i>That's what happened, you</i>

1307
01:26:54.347 --> 01:26:59.453
<i>You who charmed my dad</i>
<i>with self-effacing jokes</i>

1308
01:26:59.486 --> 01:27:03.825
<i>Sipping coffee like</i>
<i>you're on a late-night show</i>

1309
01:27:03.858 --> 01:27:07.461
<i>But then he watched me watch</i>
<i>the front door all night</i>

1310
01:27:07.494 --> 01:27:09.329
<i>Willing you to come</i>

1311
01:27:09.362 --> 01:27:12.466
<i>And he said</i>
<i>"It's supposed to be fun</i>

1312
01:27:12.499 --> 01:27:15.636
<i>"Turning 21"</i>

1313
01:27:27.882 --> 01:27:29.584
<i>Time won't fly</i>

1314
01:27:29.617 --> 01:27:32.754
<i>It's like</i>
<i>I'm paralyzed by it</i>

1315
01:27:32.787 --> 01:27:35.322
<i>I'd like to be</i>
<i>my old self again</i>

1316
01:27:35.355 --> 01:27:37.491
<i>But I'm still</i>
<i>trying to find it</i>

1317
01:27:37.525 --> 01:27:39.827
<i>After plaid shirt days</i>

1318
01:27:39.861 --> 01:27:42.830
<i>And nights when</i>
<i>you made me your own</i>

1319
01:27:42.864 --> 01:27:48.069
<i>Now you mail back my things</i>
<i>and I walk home alone</i>

1320
01:27:48.102 --> 01:27:53.406
<i>But you keep my old scarf</i>
<i>from that very first week</i>

1321
01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.077
<i>'Cause it reminds you</i>
<i>of innocence</i>

1322
01:27:56.110 --> 01:27:58.378
<i>And it smells like me</i>

1323
01:27:58.411 --> 01:27:59.847
<i>You can't get rid of it</i>

1324
01:28:00.648 --> 01:28:02.650
<i>'Cause you remember it</i>

1325
01:28:02.683 --> 01:28:08.823
<i>All too well, yeah</i>

1326
01:28:08.856 --> 01:28:14.327
<i>'Cause there we are again</i>
<i>when I loved you so</i>

1327
01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:15.930
<i>Back before you lost</i>

1328
01:28:15.963 --> 01:28:18.699
<i>The one real thing</i>
<i>you've ever known</i>

1329
01:28:18.733 --> 01:28:21.368
<i>It was rare, I was there</i>

1330
01:28:21.401 --> 01:28:27.608
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1331
01:28:28.843 --> 01:28:31.546
<i>Wind in my hair</i>
<i>You were there</i>

1332
01:28:31.579 --> 01:28:34.115
<i>You remember it all</i>

1333
01:28:34.148 --> 01:28:36.784
<i>Down the stairs</i>
<i>You were there</i>

1334
01:28:36.818 --> 01:28:39.620
<i>You remember it all</i>

1335
01:28:39.654 --> 01:28:41.889
<i>It was rare, I was there</i>

1336
01:28:41.923 --> 01:28:48.663
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1337
01:28:48.696 --> 01:28:52.567
<i>And I was never good</i>
<i>at telling jokes</i>

1338
01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.669
<i>But the punch line goes</i>

1339
01:28:54.702 --> 01:29:00.440
<i>"I'll get older</i>
<i>But your lovers stay my age"</i>

1340
01:29:00.473 --> 01:29:04.946
<i>From when your Brooklyn</i>
<i>broke my skin and bones</i>

1341
01:29:04.979 --> 01:29:10.551
<i>I'm a soldier who's</i>
<i>returning half her weight</i>

1342
01:29:10.585 --> 01:29:15.823
<i>And did the twin flame</i>
<i>bruise paint you blue?</i>

1343
01:29:15.857 --> 01:29:17.457
<i>Just between us</i>

1344
01:29:17.490 --> 01:29:20.761
<i>Did the love affair</i>
<i>maim you, too?</i>

1345
01:29:20.795 --> 01:29:24.699
<i>'Cause in this city's</i>
<i>barren cold</i>

1346
01:29:24.732 --> 01:29:29.770
<i>I still remember</i>
<i>the first fall of snow</i>

1347
01:29:29.804 --> 01:29:34.407
<i>And how it glistened</i>
<i>as it fell</i>

1348
01:29:34.441 --> 01:29:38.445
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1349
01:29:41.682 --> 01:29:42.950
<i>Just between us</i>

1350
01:29:42.984 --> 01:29:45.920
<i>Did the love affair</i>
<i>maim you</i>

1351
01:29:45.953 --> 01:29:51.893
<i>All too well?</i>

1352
01:29:51.926 --> 01:29:56.197
<i>Just between us</i>
<i>Do you remember it</i>

1353
01:29:56.230 --> 01:30:00.902
<i>All too well?</i>

1354
01:30:02.502 --> 01:30:03.905
<i>Just between us</i>

1355
01:30:03.938 --> 01:30:06.707
<i>-I remember it</i>
<i>-Just between us</i>

1356
01:30:06.741 --> 01:30:09.877
<i>-All too well</i>
<i>-Wind in my hair</i>

1357
01:30:09.911 --> 01:30:13.781
<i>-I was there, I was there</i>
<i>-I was there</i>

1358
01:30:13.814 --> 01:30:17.585
<i>-Down the stairs</i>
<i>-I was there, I was there</i>

1359
01:30:17.618 --> 01:30:18.886
<i>I was there</i>

1360
01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:22.790
<i>-Sacred prayer</i>
<i>-I was there, I was there</i>

1361
01:30:23.925 --> 01:30:27.061
<i>It was rare</i>
<i>You remember it</i>

1362
01:30:27.094 --> 01:30:30.598
<i>-All too well</i>
<i>-Wind in my hair</i>

1363
01:30:30.631 --> 01:30:34.501
<i>-I was there, I was there</i>
<i>-I was there</i>

1364
01:30:34.535 --> 01:30:38.072
<i>-Down the stairs</i>
<i>-I was there, I was there</i>

1365
01:30:38.105 --> 01:30:39.373
<i>I was there</i>

1366
01:30:39.407 --> 01:30:43.577
<i>-Sacred prayer</i>
<i>-I was there, I was there</i>

1367
01:30:44.779 --> 01:30:47.882
<i>It was rare</i>
<i>You remember it</i>

1368
01:30:49.617 --> 01:30:50.952
<i>Wind in my hair</i>

1369
01:30:50.985 --> 01:30:54.956
<i>I was there, I was there</i>

1370
01:30:54.989 --> 01:30:59.961
<i>Down the stairs</i>
<i>I was there, I was there</i>

1371
01:30:59.994 --> 01:31:04.031
<i>Sacred prayer</i>
<i>I was there, I was there</i>

1372
01:31:05.766 --> 01:31:08.602
<i>It was rare</i>
<i>You remember it</i>

1373
01:31:46.874 --> 01:31:49.977
<i>I'm doing good</i>
<i>I'm on some new shit</i>

1374
01:31:50.011 --> 01:31:53.714
<i>Been saying "yes"</i>
<i>instead of "no"</i>

1375
01:31:53.748 --> 01:31:55.816
<i>I thought I saw you</i>
<i>at the bus stop</i>

1376
01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:57.118
<i>I didn't though</i>

1377
01:32:00.654 --> 01:32:03.057
<i>I hit the ground running</i>
<i>each night</i>

1378
01:32:03.958 --> 01:32:07.094
<i>I hit the Sunday matinee</i>

1379
01:32:07.128 --> 01:32:11.065
<i>You know the greatest films</i>
<i>of all time were never made</i>

1380
01:32:14.068 --> 01:32:17.638
<i>I guess you never know</i>
<i>Never know</i>

1381
01:32:17.671 --> 01:32:21.042
<i>And if you wanted me</i>
<i>You really should've showed</i>

1382
01:32:21.075 --> 01:32:24.045
<i>And if you never bleed</i>
<i>You're never gonna grow</i>

1383
01:32:24.078 --> 01:32:26.847
<i>And it's all right now</i>

1384
01:32:28.049 --> 01:32:31.685
<i>But we were something</i>
<i>Don't you think so?</i>

1385
01:32:31.719 --> 01:32:34.855
<i>Roaring twenties</i>
<i>Tossing pennies in the pool</i>

1386
01:32:34.889 --> 01:32:37.825
<i>And if my wishes came true</i>

1387
01:32:38.626 --> 01:32:40.961
<i>It would've been you</i>

1388
01:32:41.929 --> 01:32:45.599
<i>In my defense, I have none</i>

1389
01:32:45.633 --> 01:32:48.803
<i>For never leaving</i>
<i>well enough alone</i>

1390
01:32:48.836 --> 01:32:55.042
<i>But it would've been fun</i>
<i>If you would've been the one</i>

1391
01:32:56.911 --> 01:33:00.614
<i>Ooh</i>

1392
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:05.619
<i>I have this dream</i>
<i>you're doing cool shit</i>

1393
01:33:05.653 --> 01:33:08.823
<i>Having adventures on your own</i>

1394
01:33:08.856 --> 01:33:11.158
<i>You meet some woman</i>
<i>on the Internet</i>

1395
01:33:11.192 --> 01:33:12.827
<i>And take her home</i>

1396
01:33:16.063 --> 01:33:19.633
<i>We never painted</i>
<i>by the numbers, baby</i>

1397
01:33:19.667 --> 01:33:22.837
<i>But we were making it count</i>

1398
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:26.740
<i>You know the greatest loves</i>
<i>of all time are over now</i>

1399
01:33:29.877 --> 01:33:33.114
<i>I guess you never know</i>
<i>Never know</i>

1400
01:33:33.147 --> 01:33:36.884
<i>And it's another day</i>
<i>Waking up alone</i>

1401
01:33:36.917 --> 01:33:40.154
<i>But we were something</i>
<i>Don't you think so?</i>

1402
01:33:40.187 --> 01:33:43.691
<i>Roaring twenties</i>
<i>Tossing pennies in the pool</i>

1403
01:33:43.724 --> 01:33:46.627
<i>And if my wishes came true</i>

1404
01:33:47.094 --> 01:33:49.830
<i>It would've been you</i>

1405
01:33:50.731 --> 01:33:53.968
<i>In my defense, I have none</i>

1406
01:33:54.001 --> 01:33:57.204
<i>For never leaving</i>
<i>well enough alone</i>

1407
01:33:57.238 --> 01:33:59.974
<i>But it would've been fun</i>

1408
01:34:00.875 --> 01:34:03.844
<i>If you would've been the one</i>

1409
01:34:03.878 --> 01:34:05.913
<i>Hey, yeah-yeah</i>

1410
01:34:05.946 --> 01:34:09.683
<i>I persist and resist</i>
<i>the temptation to ask you</i>

1411
01:34:09.717 --> 01:34:12.920
<i>If one thing</i>
<i>had been different</i>

1412
01:34:12.953 --> 01:34:17.992
<i>Would everything</i>
<i>be different today?</i>

1413
01:34:18.025 --> 01:34:21.162
<i>We were something</i>
<i>Don't you think so?</i>

1414
01:34:21.195 --> 01:34:24.832
<i>Rosé flowing</i>
<i>with your chosen family</i>

1415
01:34:24.865 --> 01:34:27.268
<i>And it would've been sweet</i>

1416
01:34:28.068 --> 01:34:30.771
<i>If it could've been me</i>

1417
01:34:31.739 --> 01:34:34.041
<i>In my defense, I have none</i>

1418
01:34:35.075 --> 01:34:38.245
<i>For digging up</i>
<i>the grave another time</i>

1419
01:34:38.279 --> 01:34:41.882
<i>But it would've been fun</i>

1420
01:34:41.916 --> 01:34:44.218
<i>If you would've been</i>
<i>the one</i>

1421
01:34:46.521 --> 01:34:50.124
<i>Ooh</i>

1422
01:35:08.543 --> 01:35:12.813
<i>And so, we have brought</i>
<i>the</i> folklore <i>cabin to L.A.</i>

1423
01:35:17.785 --> 01:35:22.122
<i>So, um,</i> folklore <i>is an album</i>
<i>that I am extremely proud of,</i>

1424
01:35:22.156 --> 01:35:24.325
<i>and I started, uh...</i>

1425
01:35:25.192 --> 01:35:26.760
<i>Aw...</i>

1426
01:35:26.794 --> 01:35:29.964
<i>Aw... thanks.</i>

1427
01:35:31.131 --> 01:35:33.100
<i>I immediately</i>
<i>was picturing</i>

1428
01:35:33.133 --> 01:35:36.804
<i>this album taking place</i>
<i>in the woods,</i>

1429
01:35:36.837 --> 01:35:39.006
<i>in an imaginary cabin.</i>

1430
01:35:39.039 --> 01:35:41.308
<i>In my fantasy,</i>
<i>in my imagination,</i>

1431
01:35:41.342 --> 01:35:43.277
<i>I am not</i>

1432
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:46.847
<i>a lonely millennial woman</i>
<i>covered in cat hair,</i>

1433
01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.748
<i>um...</i>

1434
01:35:47.781 --> 01:35:50.251
<i>...watching 700 hours</i>
<i>of TV a day.</i>

1435
01:35:50.284 --> 01:35:54.355
<i>In my imagination,</i>
<i>I am like a...</i>

1436
01:35:54.388 --> 01:35:56.790
<i>like a woodsy Victorian lady</i>

1437
01:35:56.824 --> 01:35:59.360
<i>who is wandering</i>
<i>through the forest,</i>

1438
01:35:59.393 --> 01:36:03.565
<i>holding, like,</i>
<i>a candlestick holder-thing</i>

1439
01:36:03.598 --> 01:36:06.568
<i>and, like, you know,</i>
<i>collecting feathers</i>

1440
01:36:06.601 --> 01:36:10.104
<i>to make my own quill</i>
<i>to write on parchment paper.</i>

1441
01:36:10.137 --> 01:36:11.438
<i>It was a whole thing.</i>

1442
01:36:11.472 --> 01:36:13.941
<i>That was how I pictured myself</i>
<i>when I was writing</i> folklore.

1443
01:36:13.974 --> 01:36:15.175
<i>And then I was like,</i>
<i>you know, maybe</i>

1444
01:36:15.209 --> 01:36:17.177
<i>I should do some other things</i>
<i>different on this album.</i>

1445
01:36:17.211 --> 01:36:19.980
<i>Maybe I should try</i>
<i>creating characters</i>

1446
01:36:20.014 --> 01:36:21.882
<i>and having these characters</i>

1447
01:36:21.915 --> 01:36:24.285
<i>fall in love</i>
<i>and break up and...</i>

1448
01:36:26.621 --> 01:36:30.224
<i>One of my favorite, um,</i>
<i>characters that I created</i>

1449
01:36:31.425 --> 01:36:34.895
<i>is, uh, I call it</i>
<i>the Teenage Love Triangle.</i>

1450
01:36:38.365 --> 01:36:42.002
<i>The catalyst character is</i>
<i>this teenage boy named James,</i>

1451
01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:45.873
<i>and he</i>

1452
01:36:45.906 --> 01:36:49.310
<i>really screws things up</i>
<i>with the love of his life,</i>

1453
01:36:49.343 --> 01:36:51.613
<i>and he has</i>
<i>to apologize to her,</i>

1454
01:36:51.646 --> 01:36:52.980
<i>and try to make it right,</i>

1455
01:36:53.947 --> 01:36:56.317
<i>and long story short,</i>

1456
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:58.952
<i>her name is Betty.</i>

1457
01:37:11.098 --> 01:37:13.367
<i>Betty, I won't</i>
<i>make assumptions</i>

1458
01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.036
<i>About why you switched</i>
<i>your homeroom</i>

1459
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:18.138
<i>But I think</i>
<i>it's 'cause of me</i>

1460
01:37:21.041 --> 01:37:24.646
<i>Betty, one time I was riding</i>
<i>on my skateboard</i>

1461
01:37:24.679 --> 01:37:26.347
<i>When I passed your house</i>

1462
01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:28.315
<i>It's like</i>
<i>I couldn't breathe</i>

1463
01:37:30.484 --> 01:37:33.153
<i>You heard the rumors</i>
<i>from Inez</i>

1464
01:37:33.187 --> 01:37:35.489
<i>You can't believe</i>
<i>a word she says</i>

1465
01:37:35.523 --> 01:37:38.392
<i>Most times</i>
<i>But this time it was true</i>

1466
01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:45.132
<i>The worst thing</i>
<i>that I ever did</i>

1467
01:37:45.165 --> 01:37:50.104
<i>Was what I did to you</i>

1468
01:37:52.172 --> 01:37:54.975
<i>But if I just showed up</i>
<i>at your party</i>

1469
01:37:55.008 --> 01:37:57.311
<i>Would you have me?</i>
<i>Would you want me?</i>

1470
01:37:57.344 --> 01:38:00.280
<i>Would you tell me</i>
<i>to go fuck myself</i>

1471
01:38:00.314 --> 01:38:02.282
<i>Or lead me to the garden?</i>

1472
01:38:02.316 --> 01:38:04.985
<i>In the garden</i>
<i>would you trust me</i>

1473
01:38:05.018 --> 01:38:08.389
<i>If I told you</i>
<i>it was just a summer thing?</i>

1474
01:38:08.422 --> 01:38:10.257
<i>I'm only 17</i>

1475
01:38:10.290 --> 01:38:15.028
<i>I don't know anything</i>
<i>but I know I miss you</i>

1476
01:38:23.538 --> 01:38:26.407
<i>Betty, I know</i>
<i>where it all went wrong</i>

1477
01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:28.475
<i>Your favorite song</i>
<i>was playing</i>

1478
01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:31.011
<i>From the far side</i>
<i>of the gym</i>

1479
01:38:33.548 --> 01:38:35.983
<i>I was nowhere to be found</i>

1480
01:38:36.016 --> 01:38:38.419
<i>I hate the crowds</i>
<i>You know that</i>

1481
01:38:38.452 --> 01:38:41.188
<i>Plus, I saw you dance</i>
<i>with him</i>

1482
01:38:43.223 --> 01:38:45.727
<i>You heard the rumors</i>
<i>from Inez</i>

1483
01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:48.262
<i>You can't believe</i>
<i>a word she says</i>

1484
01:38:48.295 --> 01:38:50.964

01:38:52.534 --> 01:38:57.504
<i>The worst thing</i>

1486
01:38:57.539 --> 01:39:02.409
<i>Was what I did to you</i>

1487
01:39:04.478 --> 01:39:07.314
<i>But if I just showed up</i>
<i>at your party</i>

1488
01:39:07.347 --> 01:39:10.050
<i>Would you have me?</i>
<i>Would you want me?</i>

1489
01:39:10.083 --> 01:39:12.986
<i>Would you tell me</i>
<i>to go fuck myself</i>

1490
01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:15.055
<i>Or lead me to the garden?</i>

1491
01:39:15.088 --> 01:39:17.357
<i>In the garden</i>
<i>would you trust me</i>

1492
01:39:17.391 --> 01:39:21.061
<i>If I told you</i>
<i>it was just a summer thing?</i>

1493
01:39:21.094 --> 01:39:22.996
<i>I'm only 17</i>

1494
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:27.501
<i>I don't know anything</i>
<i>but I know I miss you</i>

1495
01:39:36.276 --> 01:39:39.480
<i>I was walking home</i>
<i>on broken cobblestones</i>

1496
01:39:39.514 --> 01:39:42.382
<i>Just thinking of you</i>
<i>when she pulled up</i>

1497
01:39:42.416 --> 01:39:45.553
<i>Like a figment</i>
<i>of my worst intentions</i>

1498
01:39:45.587 --> 01:39:48.489
<i>She said</i>
<i>"James, get in, let's drive"</i>

1499
01:39:48.523 --> 01:39:51.158
<i>Those days turned into nights</i>

1500
01:39:51.191 --> 01:39:53.460
<i>Slept next to her but</i>

1501
01:39:53.494 --> 01:39:57.130
<i>I dreamt of you</i>
<i>all summer long</i>

1502
01:40:08.843 --> 01:40:11.245
<i>Betty, I'm here</i>
<i>on your doorstep</i>

1503
01:40:11.278 --> 01:40:13.581
<i>And I planned it out</i>
<i>for weeks now</i>

1504
01:40:13.615 --> 01:40:16.083
<i>But it's finally</i>
<i>sinking in</i>

1505
01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:21.255
<i>Betty, right now</i>
<i>is the last time</i>

1506
01:40:21.288 --> 01:40:23.558
<i>I can dream</i>
<i>about what happens</i>

1507
01:40:23.591 --> 01:40:26.360
<i>When you see my face again</i>

1508
01:40:27.595 --> 01:40:32.600
<i>The only thing I wanna do</i>

1509
01:40:32.634 --> 01:40:37.237
<i>Is make it up to you</i>

1510
01:40:39.874 --> 01:40:43.545
<i>So, I showed up at your party</i>

1511
01:40:50.150 --> 01:40:54.254
<i>Yeah, I showed up</i>
<i>at your party</i>

1512
01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:02.462
<i>Yeah, I showed up</i>
<i>at your party</i>

1513
01:41:02.496 --> 01:41:04.666
<i>Will you have me?</i>
<i>Will you love me?</i>

1514
01:41:04.699 --> 01:41:07.301
<i>Will you kiss me</i>
<i>on the porch</i>

1515
01:41:07.334 --> 01:41:10.103
<i>In front of</i>
<i>all your stupid friends?</i>

1516
01:41:10.137 --> 01:41:11.371
<i>If you kiss me</i>

1517
01:41:11.405 --> 01:41:13.675
<i>Will it be</i>
<i>just like I dreamed it?</i>

1518
01:41:13.708 --> 01:41:16.276
<i>Will it patch</i>
<i>your broken wings?</i>

1519
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:18.111
<i>I'm only 17</i>

1520
01:41:18.145 --> 01:41:19.614
<i>I don't know anything</i>

1521
01:41:19.647 --> 01:41:22.482
<i>But I know I miss you</i>

1522
01:41:24.619 --> 01:41:27.387
<i>Standing in your cardigan</i>

1523
01:41:29.624 --> 01:41:33.360
<i>Kissing in my car again</i>

1524
01:41:33.393 --> 01:41:38.231
<i>Stopped at a streetlight</i>
<i>You know I miss you</i>

1525
01:42:02.523 --> 01:42:05.927
<i>Rebekah rode up</i>
<i>on the afternoon train</i>

1526
01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:08.161
<i>It was sunny</i>

1527
01:42:08.195 --> 01:42:10.230
<i>Her saltbox house</i>
<i>on the coast</i>

1528
01:42:10.263 --> 01:42:13.133
<i>Took her mind off St. Louis</i>

1529
01:42:15.536 --> 01:42:18.706
<i>Bill was the heir</i>
<i>to the Standard Oil name</i>

1530
01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:20.575
<i>And money</i>

1531
01:42:20.608 --> 01:42:22.209
<i>And the town said</i>

1532
01:42:22.242 --> 01:42:25.580
<i>"How did a middle-class</i>
<i>divorcée do it?"</i>

1533
01:42:28.415 --> 01:42:31.552
<i>The wedding was charming</i>
<i>If a little gauche</i>

1534
01:42:31.586 --> 01:42:34.656
<i>There's only so far</i>
<i>new money goes</i>

1535
01:42:34.689 --> 01:42:36.189
<i>They picked out a home</i>

1536
01:42:36.223 --> 01:42:38.626
<i>And called it "Holiday House"</i>

1537
01:42:41.428 --> 01:42:44.565
<i>Their parties were tasteful</i>
<i>If a little loud</i>

1538
01:42:44.599 --> 01:42:47.702
<i>The doctor had told him</i>
<i>to settle down</i>

1539
01:42:47.735 --> 01:42:52.339
<i>It must have been her fault</i>
<i>his heart gave out</i>

1540
01:42:52.372 --> 01:42:54.274
<i>And they said</i>

1541
01:42:54.307 --> 01:42:57.578
<i>"There goes the last great</i>
<i>American dynasty</i>

1542
01:43:00.548 --> 01:43:02.617
<i>"Who knows</i>

1543
01:43:02.650 --> 01:43:03.818
<i>"What could've been</i>

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:08.990
<i>"There goes</i>

1545
01:43:09.023 --> 01:43:10.725
<i>"This town has ever seen</i>

1546
01:43:12.459 --> 01:43:16.363
<i>"She had a marvelous time</i>
<i>ruining everything"</i>

1547
01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:26.541
<i>Rebekah gave up on</i>
<i>the Rhode Island set forever</i>

1548
01:43:26.574 --> 01:43:30.277
<i>Flew in all her Bitch Pack</i>
<i>friends from the city</i>

1549
01:43:32.279 --> 01:43:33.815
<i>Filled the pool</i>
<i>with champagne</i>

1550
01:43:33.848 --> 01:43:35.016
<i>And swam with the big names</i>

1551
01:43:35.049 --> 01:43:39.687
<i>And blew through the money</i>
<i>on the boys and the ballet</i>

1552
01:43:39.721 --> 01:43:43.256
<i>And losing on</i>
<i>card game bets with Dalí</i>

1553
01:43:44.491 --> 01:43:45.459
<i>And they said</i>

1554
01:43:45.492 --> 01:43:49.564
<i>"There goes the last</i>

1555
01:43:52.567 --> 01:43:54.569

<i>"She had a marvelous time</i>

1560
01:44:11.686 --> 01:44:14.722
<i>They say</i>
<i>she was seen on occasion</i>

1561
01:44:14.756 --> 01:44:18.492
<i>Pacing the rocks, staring</i>
<i>out at the midnight sea</i>

1562
01:44:18.526 --> 01:44:21.428
<i>And in a feud</i>
<i>with her neighbor</i>

1563
01:44:21.461 --> 01:44:24.866
<i>She stole his dog</i>
<i>and dyed it key lime green</i>

1564
01:44:24.899 --> 01:44:27.668
<i>Fifty years is a long time</i>

1565
01:44:27.702 --> 01:44:31.304
<i>Holiday House sat quietly</i>
<i>on that beach</i>

1566
01:44:31.338 --> 01:44:34.075
<i>Free of women with madness</i>

1567
01:44:34.108 --> 01:44:37.812
<i>Their men and bad habits</i>
<i>And then it was bought by me</i>

1568
01:44:44.484 --> 01:44:47.755
<i>Who knows, if I never</i>
<i>showed up what could've been</i>

1569
01:44:50.725 --> 01:44:54.695

<i>Ruining everything</i>

1573

<i>A marvelous time</i>

1574
01:45:14.582 --> 01:45:16.483

<i>Salt air</i>

1578
01:45:45.746 --> 01:45:48.448
<i>And the rust on your door</i>

1579
01:45:48.481 --> 01:45:53.453
<i>I never needed anything more</i>

1580
01:45:53.486 --> 01:45:55.455
<i>Whispers</i>

1581
01:45:56.557 --> 01:45:58.626
<i>Of "Are you sure?"</i>

1582
01:45:59.594 --> 01:46:03.463
<i>"Never have I ever before"</i>

1583
01:46:03.496 --> 01:46:06.534
<i>But I can see us</i>

1584
01:46:06.567 --> 01:46:09.670
<i>August slipped away</i>

1585

<i>'Cause it was never mine</i>

1586

<i>'Cause you were</i>

1589

<i>Your back</i>

1590
01:46:28.656 --> 01:46:31.592
<i>Beneath the sun</i>

1591
01:46:31.626 --> 01:46:35.830
<i>Wishing I could</i>

1592
01:46:35.863 --> 01:46:37.899
<i>Will you call</i>

1593
01:46:39.066 --> 01:46:41.969
<i>When you're back at school?</i>

1594

01:49:58.265 --> 01:50:00.701
<i>Look at this</i>
<i>godforsaken mess</i>

1655
01:50:00.734 --> 01:50:02.169
<i>That you made me</i>

1656
01:50:02.203 --> 01:50:04.738
<i>You showed me colors</i>
<i>you know</i>

1657
01:50:04.772 --> 01:50:08.008
<i>I can't see with anyone else</i>

1658
01:50:10.211 --> 01:50:12.146
<i>Don't call me "kid"</i>

1659
01:50:12.179 --> 01:50:14.148
<i>Don't call me "baby"</i>

1660
01:50:14.181 --> 01:50:18.185
<i>Look at this idiotic fool</i>
<i>you made me</i>

1661
01:50:18.219 --> 01:50:20.888
<i>You taught me</i>
<i>a secret language</i>

1662
01:50:20.921 --> 01:50:24.091
<i>I can't speak</i>
<i>with anyone else</i>

1663
01:50:25.726 --> 01:50:29.029
<i>And you know damn well</i>

1664
01:50:29.063 --> 01:50:33.000
<i>For you I would ruin myself</i>

1665
01:50:33.033 --> 01:50:37.771
<i>A million little times</i>

1666
01:50:38.906 --> 01:50:42.443
<i>That's the thing</i>
<i>about illicit affairs</i>

1667
01:51:17.178 --> 01:51:19.079
<i>We gather here</i>

1668
01:51:19.113 --> 01:51:23.017
<i>We line up weeping</i>
<i>in a sunlit room</i>

1669
01:51:23.050 --> 01:51:27.788
<i>And if I'm on fire</i>

1670
01:51:27.821 --> 01:51:31.158
<i>You'll be made</i>
<i>of ashes, too</i>

1671
01:51:31.192 --> 01:51:35.262
<i>Even on my worst day</i>
<i>Did I deserve, babe</i>

1672
01:51:35.296 --> 01:51:38.165
<i>All the hell you gave me?</i>

1673
01:51:39.133 --> 01:51:40.868
<i>'Cause I loved you</i>

1674
01:51:40.901 --> 01:51:46.207
<i>I swear I loved you</i>
<i>Till my dying day</i>

1675
01:51:48.342 --> 01:51:55.983
<i>I didn't have it in myself</i>
<i>to go with grace</i>

1676
01:51:56.016 --> 01:52:02.256
<i>And you're the hero</i>
<i>flying around saving face</i>

1677
01:52:03.824 --> 01:52:08.729
<i>And if I'm dead to you</i>
<i>Why are you at the wake?</i>

1678
01:52:09.163 --> 01:52:10.998
<i>Cursing my name</i>

1679
01:52:11.031 --> 01:52:13.000
<i>Wishing I stayed</i>

1680
01:52:13.033 --> 01:52:15.903
<i>Look at how my tears ricochet</i>

1681
01:52:23.877 --> 01:52:26.780
<i>We gather stones</i>

1682
01:52:26.814 --> 01:52:29.783
<i>Never knowing</i>
<i>what they'll mean</i>

1683
01:52:31.151 --> 01:52:33.921
<i>Some to throw</i>

1684
01:52:33.954 --> 01:52:37.258
<i>Some to make a diamond ring</i>

1685
01:52:37.291 --> 01:52:39.994
<i>You know I didn't want to</i>

1686
01:52:40.027 --> 01:52:41.862
<i>Have to haunt you</i>

1687
01:52:41.895 --> 01:52:44.164
<i>But what a ghostly scene</i>

1688
01:52:45.332 --> 01:52:47.167
<i>You wear the same jewels</i>

1689
01:52:47.201 --> 01:52:49.069
<i>That I gave you</i>

1690
01:52:49.103 --> 01:52:51.939
<i>As you bury me</i>

1691
01:52:55.042 --> 01:53:01.115
<i>I didn't have it in myself</i>
<i>to go with grace</i>

1692
01:53:02.383 --> 01:53:04.151
<i>'Cause when I'd fight</i>

1693
01:53:04.184 --> 01:53:09.990
<i>You used to tell me</i>
<i>I was brave</i>

1694
01:53:10.024 --> 01:53:15.062
<i>And if I'm dead to you</i>
<i>Why are you at the wake?</i>

1695
01:53:15.429 --> 01:53:17.431
<i>Cursing my name</i>

1696
01:53:17.464 --> 01:53:19.300
<i>Wishing I stayed</i>

1697
01:53:19.333 --> 01:53:22.870
<i>Look at how</i>
<i>my tears ricochet</i>

1698
01:53:22.903 --> 01:53:26.073
<i>And I can go</i>
<i>anywhere I want</i>

1699
01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:28.409
<i>Anywhere I want</i>

1700
01:53:28.442 --> 01:53:30.377
<i>Just not home</i>

1701
01:53:30.411 --> 01:53:34.014
<i>And you can aim</i>
<i>for my heart, go for blood</i>

1702
01:53:34.048 --> 01:53:37.918
<i>But you would still miss me</i>
<i>in your bones</i>

1703
01:53:37.951 --> 01:53:40.854
<i>And I still talk to you</i>

1704
01:53:41.889 --> 01:53:45.192
<i>When I'm screaming</i>
<i>at the sky</i>

1705
01:53:45.225 --> 01:53:48.896
<i>And when you can't</i>
<i>sleep at night</i>

1706
01:53:48.929 --> 01:53:53.200
<i>You hear</i>
<i>my stolen lullabies</i>

1707
01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:07.147
<i>I didn't have it in myself</i>
<i>to go with grace</i>

1708
01:54:07.181 --> 01:54:13.454
<i>And so the battleships</i>
<i>will sink beneath the waves</i>

1709
01:54:14.522 --> 01:54:16.457
<i>You had to kill me</i>

1710
01:54:16.490 --> 01:54:20.294
<i>But it killed you</i>
<i>just the same</i>

1711
01:54:20.327 --> 01:54:22.196
<i>Cursing my name</i>

1712
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:23.964
<i>Wishing I stayed</i>

1713
01:54:23.997 --> 01:54:27.234
<i>You turned into</i>
<i>your worst fears</i>

1714
01:54:27.267 --> 01:54:31.372
<i>And you're tossing out blame</i>
<i>Drunk on this pain</i>

1715
01:54:31.405 --> 01:54:33.974
<i>Crossing out the good years</i>

1716
01:54:34.007 --> 01:54:36.910
<i>And you're cursing my name</i>

1717
01:54:36.944 --> 01:54:38.412
<i>Wishing I stayed</i>

1718
01:54:38.445 --> 01:54:42.082
<i>Look at how</i>
<i>my tears ricochet</i>

1719
01:55:37.772 --> 01:55:40.575
<i>Midnight</i>

1720
01:55:40.608 --> 01:55:44.344
<i>You come and pick me up</i>
<i>No headlights</i>

1721
01:55:47.549 --> 01:55:49.450
<i>Long drive</i>

1722
01:55:50.585 --> 01:55:54.321
<i>Could end in burning flames</i>
<i>or paradise</i>

1723
01:55:57.357 --> 01:56:00.027
<i>Fade into view, oh</i>

1724
01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:04.231
<i>It's been a while since</i>
<i>I have even heard from you</i>

1725
01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:07.234
<i>Heard from you</i>

1726
01:56:09.102 --> 01:56:11.472
<i>I should just tell you</i>
<i>to leave 'cause I</i>

1727
01:56:11.505 --> 01:56:13.541
<i>Know exactly</i>
<i>where it leads, but I</i>

1728
01:56:13.575 --> 01:56:17.177
<i>Watch us go 'round</i>
<i>and 'round each time</i>

1729
01:56:17.211 --> 01:56:22.282
<i>You got that James Dean</i>
<i>daydream look in your eye</i>

1730
01:56:22.316 --> 01:56:27.287
<i>And I got that red lip</i>
<i>classic thing that you like</i>

1731
01:56:27.321 --> 01:56:30.224
<i>And when we go crashing down</i>

1732
01:56:30.257 --> 01:56:32.192
<i>We come back every time</i>

1733
01:56:32.226 --> 01:56:35.095
<i>'Cause we never go</i>
<i>out of style</i>

1734
01:56:35.128 --> 01:56:37.498
<i>We never go out of style</i>

1735
01:56:37.532 --> 01:56:42.503
<i>You got that long hair</i>
<i>Slicked back, white T-shirt</i>

1736
01:56:42.537 --> 01:56:45.372
<i>And I got that good girl faith</i>

1737
01:56:45.405 --> 01:56:47.642
<i>And a tight little skirt</i>

1738
01:56:47.675 --> 01:56:50.410
<i>And when we go crashing down</i>

1739
01:56:50.444 --> 01:56:52.547
<i>We come back every time</i>

1740
01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:55.349
<i>'Cause we never go</i>

<i>We never go out of style</i>

1742
01:56:58.418 --> 01:57:01.288
<i>Take me home</i>

1743
01:57:02.857 --> 01:57:06.159
<i>Just take me home</i>

1744
01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:08.161
<i>Yeah</i>

1745
01:57:08.195 --> 01:57:10.430
<i>Just take me home</i>

1746
01:57:10.464 --> 01:57:16.470
<i>Ooh, oh, ooh, oh, oh</i>

1747
01:57:16.503 --> 01:57:18.238
<i>-Out of style</i>
<i>-Oh</i>

1748
01:57:18.272 --> 01:57:23.210
<i>You got that James Dean</i>
<i>daydream look in your eye</i>

<i>And when we go</i>

1753
01:57:31.184 --> 01:57:33.220
<i>We come back every time</i>

<i>We never go out of style</i>

1756
01:57:54.642 --> 01:57:57.277
<i>Nice to meet you</i>
<i>Where you been?</i>

1757
01:57:57.311 --> 01:57:59.581
<i>I could show you</i>
<i>incredible things</i>

1758
01:57:59.614 --> 01:58:02.316
<i>Magic, madness, heaven, sin</i>

1759
01:58:02.349 --> 01:58:04.318
<i>Saw you there</i>
<i>and I thought</i>

1760
01:58:04.351 --> 01:58:06.353
<i>"Oh, my God</i>
<i>Look at that face</i>

1761
01:58:06.386 --> 01:58:09.323
<i>"You look like</i>
<i>my next mistake</i>

1762
01:58:09.356 --> 01:58:13.327
<i>"Love's a game, wanna play?"</i>

1763
01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:14.461
<i>Ayy</i>

1764
01:58:14.494 --> 01:58:17.264
<i>New money, suit and tie</i>

1765
01:58:17.297 --> 01:58:19.601
<i>I can read you</i>
<i>like a magazine</i>

1766
01:58:19.634 --> 01:58:22.336
<i>Ain't it funny? Rumors fly</i>

1767
01:58:22.369 --> 01:58:24.539
<i>And I know you heard</i>
<i>about me</i>

1768
01:58:24.572 --> 01:58:26.541
<i>So, hey, let's be friends</i>

1769
01:58:26.574 --> 01:58:29.276
<i>I'm dying to see</i>
<i>how this one ends</i>

1770
01:58:29.309 --> 01:58:31.679
<i>Grab your passport</i>
<i>and my hand</i>

1771
01:58:31.713 --> 01:58:34.414
<i>I can make the bad guys good</i>
<i>for a weekend</i>

1772
01:58:34.448 --> 01:58:36.918
<i>So it's gonna be forever</i>

1773
01:58:36.951 --> 01:58:39.386
<i>Or it's gonna</i>
<i>go down in flames</i>

1774
01:58:39.419 --> 01:58:41.756
<i>You can tell me</i>
<i>when it's over, mm</i>

1775
01:58:41.789 --> 01:58:44.424
<i>If the high</i>
<i>was worth the pain</i>

1776
01:58:44.458 --> 01:58:47.260
<i>Got a long list of ex-lovers</i>

1777
01:58:47.294 --> 01:58:49.429
<i>They'll tell you I'm insane</i>

1778
01:58:49.463 --> 01:58:52.165
<i>'Cause you know</i>
<i>I love the players</i>

1779
01:58:52.199 --> 01:58:54.434
<i>And you love the game</i>

1780
01:58:54.468 --> 01:58:57.270
<i>'Cause we're young</i>
<i>and we're reckless</i>

1781
01:58:57.304 --> 01:58:59.473
<i>We'll take this</i>
<i>way too far</i>

1782
01:58:59.506 --> 01:59:02.209
<i>It'll leave you</i>
<i>breathless, mm</i>

1783
01:59:02.242 --> 01:59:04.444
<i>Or with a nasty scar</i>

1784
01:59:04.478 --> 01:59:07.214
<i>Got a long list of ex-lovers</i>

1785
01:59:07.247 --> 01:59:09.517
<i>They'll tell you I'm insane</i>

1786
01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:12.452
<i>But I've got</i>
<i>a blank space, baby</i>

1787
01:59:12.486 --> 01:59:15.155
<i>And I'll write your name</i>

1788
01:59:19.594 --> 01:59:22.396
<i>Cherry lips, crystal skies</i>

1789
01:59:22.429 --> 01:59:24.699
<i>I could show you</i>
<i>incredible things</i>

1790
01:59:24.732 --> 01:59:27.401
<i>Stolen kisses, pretty lies</i>

1791
01:59:27.434 --> 01:59:29.469
<i>You're the King, baby</i>
<i>I'm your Queen</i>

1792
01:59:29.503 --> 01:59:31.673
<i>Find out what you want</i>

1793
01:59:31.706 --> 01:59:34.207
<i>Be that girl for a month</i>

1794
01:59:34.241 --> 01:59:38.278
<i>Wait, the worst</i>
<i>is yet to come</i>

1795
01:59:38.311 --> 01:59:39.647
<i>Oh, no</i>

1796
01:59:39.681 --> 01:59:42.382
<i>Screaming, crying</i>
<i>Perfect storms</i>

1797
01:59:42.416 --> 01:59:44.819
<i>I can make</i>
<i>all the tables turn</i>

1798
01:59:44.852 --> 01:59:47.454
<i>Rose garden</i>
<i>filled with thorns</i>

1799
01:59:47.487 --> 01:59:49.423
<i>Keep you</i>
<i>second-guessing like</i>

1800
01:59:49.456 --> 01:59:51.425
<i>"Oh, my God, who is she?"</i>

1801
01:59:51.458 --> 01:59:54.261
<i>I get drunk on jealousy</i>

1802
01:59:54.294 --> 01:59:56.564
<i>But you'll come back</i>
<i>each time you leave</i>

1803
01:59:56.597 --> 01:59:58.231
<i>'Cause, darling</i>
<i>I'm a nightmare</i>

1804
01:59:58.265 --> 01:59:59.600
<i>Dressed like a daydream</i>

1805
01:59:59.634 --> 02:00:02.003
<i>So it's gonna be forever</i>

1806
02:00:02.036 --> 02:00:04.404
<i>Or it's gonna go</i>
<i>down in flames</i>

1807

<i>You can tell me</i>

1984
02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:48.903
<i>You made a really deep cut</i>

1985
02:07:48.936 --> 02:07:51.172
<i>And, baby</i>
<i>Now we got bad blood</i>

1986
02:07:51.205 --> 02:07:52.206
<i>Hey</i>

1987
02:08:30.945 --> 02:08:33.347
<i>Welcome to the acoustic set!</i>

1988
02:08:37.818 --> 02:08:40.221
<i>When I dreamed up the idea</i>
<i>of The Eras Tour,</i>

1989
02:08:40.254 --> 02:08:43.090
<i>I thought it would be</i>
<i>really fun to sort of</i>

1990
02:08:43.123 --> 02:08:45.359
<i>go back through</i>

1991
02:08:45.392 --> 02:08:48.062
<i>all these different phases</i>
<i>I've had musically,</i>

1992
02:08:48.095 --> 02:08:49.163
<i>because it's been,</i>

1993
02:08:49.196 --> 02:08:50.397
<i>I mean, it's been</i>
<i>a little bit of everything.</i>

1994
02:08:50.431 --> 02:08:55.236
<i>You've been so kind to me</i>
<i>in letting me explore genres</i>

1995
02:08:55.269 --> 02:08:57.938
<i>and step outside boxes</i>
<i>that are created for us</i>

1996
02:08:57.972 --> 02:08:59.073
<i>in the music industry.</i>

1997
02:08:59.106 --> 02:09:02.009
<i>And that's only because of you</i>
<i>that I get to do that.</i>

1998
02:09:02.042 --> 02:09:03.344
<i>So, thank you...</i>

1999
02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:07.781
<i>...because it's just</i>
<i>so much fun.</i>

2000
02:09:07.815 --> 02:09:09.250
<i>It's just so much fun</i>
<i>to get to play,</i>

2001
02:09:09.283 --> 02:09:10.117
<i>and to get to experiment,</i>

2002
02:09:10.150 --> 02:09:11.986
<i>and to get to grow</i>
<i>as an artist.</i>

2003
02:09:12.019 --> 02:09:13.020
<i>But I did want to play a song</i>

2004
02:09:14.288 --> 02:09:18.826
<i>just to thank the people</i>
<i>who liked me</i>

2005
02:09:18.859 --> 02:09:21.929
<i>when I was a little teenager</i>
<i>writing songs</i>

2006
02:09:21.962 --> 02:09:23.998
<i>for my ninth grade</i>
<i>talent show.</i>

2007
02:09:44.318 --> 02:09:47.154
<i>I was riding shotgun</i>
<i>With my hair undone</i>

2008
02:09:47.187 --> 02:09:49.591
<i>In the front seat of his car</i>

2009
02:09:49.624 --> 02:09:51.091
<i>He's got a one-hand feel</i>

2010
02:09:51.125 --> 02:09:52.326
<i>On the steering wheel</i>

2011
02:09:52.359 --> 02:09:55.296
<i>The other on my heart</i>

2012
02:09:55.329 --> 02:09:57.599
<i>I look around</i>
<i>Turn the radio down</i>

2013
02:09:57.632 --> 02:10:00.167
<i>He says</i>
<i>"Baby, is something wrong?"</i>

2014
02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:02.836
<i>I say, "Nothing</i>
<i>I was just thinking</i>

2015
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:04.905
<i>"How we don't have a song"</i>

2016
02:10:06.206 --> 02:10:07.107
<i>And he says</i>

2017
02:10:07.141 --> 02:10:09.843
<i>Our song is</i>
<i>the slamming screen door</i>

2018
02:10:09.877 --> 02:10:12.946
<i>Sneakin' out late</i>
<i>Tapping on your window</i>

2019
02:10:12.980 --> 02:10:16.016
<i>When we're on the phone</i>
<i>and you talk real slow</i>

2020
02:10:16.050 --> 02:10:18.185
<i>'Cause it's late</i>
<i>and your mama don't know</i>

2021
02:10:18.218 --> 02:10:19.953
<i>Our song</i>
<i>is the way you laugh</i>

2022
02:10:19.987 --> 02:10:20.954
<i>The first date</i>

2023
02:10:20.988 --> 02:10:23.357
<i>"Man, I didn't kiss her</i>
<i>and I should have"</i>

2024
02:10:23.390 --> 02:10:28.862
<i>And when I got home</i>
<i>'fore I said, "Amen"</i>

2025
02:10:28.896 --> 02:10:33.901
<i>Asking God</i>
<i>if he could play it again</i>

2026
02:10:44.244 --> 02:10:46.246
<i>I was walking up</i>
<i>The front porch steps</i>

2027
02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:49.083
<i>After everything that day</i>

2028
02:10:49.116 --> 02:10:50.150
<i>Had gone all wrong</i>

2029
02:10:50.184 --> 02:10:54.355
<i>And been trampled on</i>
<i>And lost and thrown away</i>

2030
02:10:54.388 --> 02:10:57.124
<i>Got to the hallway</i>
<i>Well, on my way</i>

2031
02:10:57.157 --> 02:10:59.460
<i>To my lovin' bed</i>

2032
02:10:59.493 --> 02:11:01.128
<i>I almost didn't notice</i>

2033
02:11:01.161 --> 02:11:05.099
<i>All the roses</i>
<i>And the note that said</i>

2034
02:11:05.132 --> 02:11:07.434
<i>Our song is</i>
<i>the slamming screen door</i>

2035
02:11:07.468 --> 02:11:10.471
<i>Sneakin' out late</i>
<i>Tapping on your window</i>

2036
02:11:10.504 --> 02:11:13.974
<i>When we're on the phone</i>
<i>and you talk real slow</i>

2037
02:11:14.007 --> 02:11:16.009
<i>'Cause it's late</i>
<i>and your mama don't know</i>

2038
02:11:16.043 --> 02:11:18.011
<i>Our song</i>
<i>is the way you laugh</i>

2039
02:11:18.045 --> 02:11:19.012
<i>The first date</i>

2040
02:11:19.046 --> 02:11:21.315
<i>"Man, I didn't kiss her</i>

2041
02:11:21.348 --> 02:11:26.387
<i>And when I got home</i>
<i>'fore I said, "Amen"</i>

2042
02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:31.892
<i>Asking God</i>
<i>if he could play it again</i>

2043
02:11:42.570 --> 02:11:48.075
<i>I've heard every album</i>
<i>Listened to the radio</i>

2044
02:11:48.108 --> 02:11:53.080
<i>Waited for something</i>
<i>to come along</i>

2045
02:11:53.113 --> 02:11:56.950
<i>That was as good as our song</i>

2046
02:11:56.984 --> 02:11:59.219
<i>'Cause our song is</i>
<i>the slamming screen door</i>

2047
02:11:59.253 --> 02:12:02.156
<i>Sneakin' out late</i>
<i>Tapping on his window</i>

<i>'Cause it's late</i>
<i>and his mama don't know</i>

2050
02:12:07.428 --> 02:12:09.296
<i>Our song</i>
<i>is the way he laughs</i>

2051
02:12:09.329 --> 02:12:10.297
<i>The first date</i>

2052
02:12:10.330 --> 02:12:13.000
<i>"Man, I didn't kiss him</i>

2053
02:12:13.033 --> 02:12:18.138
<i>And when I got home</i>

02:12:18.172 --> 02:12:23.477
<i>Asking God</i>

2055
02:12:27.147 --> 02:12:32.319
<i>Play it again</i>

2056
02:12:32.352 --> 02:12:35.189
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

2057
02:12:35.222 --> 02:12:36.990
<i>Oh-oh, yeah</i>

2058
02:12:38.258 --> 02:12:41.061
<i>I was riding shotgun</i>
<i>With my hair undone</i>

2059
02:12:41.094 --> 02:12:43.030
<i>In the front seat of his car</i>

2060
02:12:44.131 --> 02:12:45.165
<i>I grabbed a pen</i>

2061
02:12:45.199 --> 02:12:50.504
<i>And an old napkin</i>
<i>And I wrote down our song</i>

2062
02:13:27.074 --> 02:13:31.078
<i>Summer went away</i>
<i>Still the yearning stays</i>

2063
02:13:31.111 --> 02:13:34.582
<i>I play it cool</i>
<i>with the best of them</i>

2064
02:13:34.616 --> 02:13:36.518
<i>I wait patiently</i>

2065
02:13:36.551 --> 02:13:39.253
<i>He's gonna notice me</i>

2066
02:13:39.286 --> 02:13:43.090
<i>It's okay</i>
<i>We're the best of friends</i>

2067
02:13:44.324 --> 02:13:46.426
<i>Anyway</i>

2068
02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:48.428
<i>I hear it in your voice</i>

2069
02:13:48.462 --> 02:13:50.464
<i>You're smoking</i>
<i>with your boys</i>

2070
02:13:50.497 --> 02:13:54.536
<i>I touch my phone</i>
<i>as if it's your face</i>

2071
02:13:54.569 --> 02:13:56.436
<i>I didn't choose this town</i>

2072
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:59.072
<i>I dream of getting out</i>

2073
02:13:59.106 --> 02:14:02.510
<i>There's just one</i>
<i>who could make me stay</i>

2074
02:14:04.177 --> 02:14:06.581
<i>All my days</i>

2075
02:14:06.614 --> 02:14:10.652
<i>From sprinkler splashes</i>
<i>to fireplace ashes</i>

2076
02:14:10.685 --> 02:14:14.589
<i>I waited ages</i>
<i>to see you there</i>

2077
02:14:14.622 --> 02:14:18.860
<i>I search the party</i>
<i>of better bodies</i>

2078
02:14:18.893 --> 02:14:23.463
<i>Just to learn</i>
<i>that you never cared</i>

2079
02:14:23.497 --> 02:14:26.433
<i>You're on your own, kid</i>
<i>You always have been</i>

2080
02:14:34.408 --> 02:14:36.343
<i>I see the great escape</i>

2081
02:14:36.376 --> 02:14:38.312
<i>So long, Daisy May</i>

2082
02:14:38.345 --> 02:14:42.316
<i>I picked the petals</i>
<i>He loves me not</i>

2083
02:14:42.349 --> 02:14:44.351
<i>Something different bloomed</i>

2084
02:14:44.384 --> 02:14:46.320
<i>Writing in my room</i>

2085
02:14:46.353 --> 02:14:50.357
<i>I play my songs</i>
<i>in the parking lot</i>

2086
02:14:51.491 --> 02:14:54.328
<i>I'll run away</i>

2087
02:14:54.361 --> 02:14:58.332
<i>From sprinkler splashes</i>
<i>to fireplace ashes</i>

2088
02:14:58.365 --> 02:15:02.235
<i>I called a taxi</i>
<i>to take me there</i>

2089
02:15:02.269 --> 02:15:06.373
<i>I search the party</i>
<i>of better bodies</i>

2090
02:15:06.406 --> 02:15:11.144
<i>Just to learn</i>
<i>that my dreams aren't rare</i>

2091
02:15:11.178 --> 02:15:14.314
<i>You're on your own, kid</i>
<i>You always have been</i>

2092
02:15:29.964 --> 02:15:33.935
<i>From sprinkler splashes</i>
<i>to fireplace ashes</i>

2093
02:15:33.968 --> 02:15:37.705
<i>I gave my blood, sweat</i>
<i>and tears for this</i>

2094
02:15:37.739 --> 02:15:41.709
<i>I hosted parties</i>
<i>and starved my body</i>

2095
02:15:41.743 --> 02:15:45.647
<i>Like I'd be saved</i>
<i>by a perfect kiss</i>

2096
02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:49.651
<i>The jokes weren't funny</i>
<i>I took the money</i>

2097
02:15:49.684 --> 02:15:53.554
<i>My friends from home</i>
<i>don't know what to say</i>

2098
02:15:53.588 --> 02:15:57.391
<i>I looked around</i>
<i>in a blood-soaked gown</i>

2099
02:15:57.424 --> 02:16:01.395
<i>And I saw something</i>
<i>they can't take away</i>

2100
02:16:01.428 --> 02:16:03.397
<i>'Cause there were pages turned</i>

2101
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:05.399
<i>With the bridges burned</i>

2102
02:16:05.432 --> 02:16:09.369
<i>Everything you lose</i>
<i>is a step you take</i>

2103
02:16:09.403 --> 02:16:11.539
<i>So make</i>
<i>the friendship bracelets</i>

2104
02:16:11.572 --> 02:16:13.541
<i>Take the moment and taste it</i>

2105
02:16:13.574 --> 02:16:17.578
<i>You've got no reason</i>
<i>to be afraid</i>

2106
02:16:18.445 --> 02:16:20.414
<i>You're on your own, kid</i>

2107
02:16:22.583 --> 02:16:24.519
<i>Yeah, you can face this</i>

2108
02:16:26.788 --> 02:16:30.190
<i>You're on your own, kid</i>
<i>You always have been</i>

2109
02:18:22.703 --> 02:18:24.304
<i>Meet me at midnight</i>

2110
02:18:28.375 --> 02:18:30.611
<i>Oh oh-oh</i>

2111
02:18:30.645 --> 02:18:32.914
<i>Oh oh-oh</i>

2112
02:18:32.947 --> 02:18:35.683
<i>Oh oh-oh whoa</i>

2113
02:18:35.716 --> 02:18:38.653
<i>Whoa whoa whoa whoa</i>

2114
02:18:38.686 --> 02:18:40.555
<i>Staring at the ceiling</i>
<i>with you</i>

2115
02:18:41.856 --> 02:18:46.561
<i>Oh, you don't ever</i>
<i>say too much</i>

2116
02:18:48.596 --> 02:18:50.798
<i>You don't really read into</i>

2117
02:18:51.732 --> 02:18:56.369
<i>My melancholia</i>

2118
02:18:59.406 --> 02:19:01.642
<i>-I've been under scrutiny</i>
<i>-Yeah, oh yeah</i>

2119
02:19:01.676 --> 02:19:04.145
<i>-You handle it beautifully</i>
<i>-Yeah, oh yeah</i>

2120
02:19:04.178 --> 02:19:05.713
<i>All this shit is new to me</i>

2121
02:19:05.746 --> 02:19:06.881
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

2122
02:19:08.983 --> 02:19:13.588
<i>I feel the lavender haze</i>
<i>creeping up on me</i>

2123
02:19:13.855 --> 02:19:15.523
<i>Surreal</i>

2124
02:19:15.556 --> 02:19:18.659
<i>I'm damned if I do give</i>
<i>a damn what people say</i>

2125
02:19:18.693 --> 02:19:20.427
<i>No deal</i>

2126
02:19:20.460 --> 02:19:24.632
<i>The 1950s shit</i>
<i>they want from me</i>

2127
02:19:24.665 --> 02:19:29.837
<i>I just wanna stay</i>
<i>in that lavender haze</i>

2128
02:19:29.871 --> 02:19:32.640
<i>Oh oh-oh</i>

2129
02:19:32.673 --> 02:19:34.909
<i>Oh oh-oh whoa</i>

2130
02:19:34.942 --> 02:19:37.511
<i>Whoa whoa whoa whoa</i>

2131
02:19:38.045 --> 02:19:39.914
<i>All they keep asking me</i>

2132
02:19:39.947 --> 02:19:41.448
<i>All they keep asking me</i>

2133
02:19:41.481 --> 02:19:45.786
<i>Is if I'm gonna be your bride</i>

2134
02:19:47.922 --> 02:19:49.857
<i>The only kinda girl they see</i>

2135
02:19:49.891 --> 02:19:51.192
<i>Only kinda girl they see</i>

2136
02:19:51.225 --> 02:19:55.763
<i>Is a one-night or a wife</i>

2137
02:19:58.666 --> 02:20:00.902
<i>-I find it dizzying</i>
<i>-Yeah, oh yeah</i>

2138
02:20:00.935 --> 02:20:02.502
<i>They're bringing up</i>
<i>my history</i>

2139
02:20:02.536 --> 02:20:03.604
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

2140
02:20:03.638 --> 02:20:04.805
<i>But you weren't</i>
<i>even listening</i>

2141
02:20:04.839 --> 02:20:06.506
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

2142
02:20:06.908 --> 02:20:08.576
<i>Ooh ooh ooh</i>

2143
02:20:08.609 --> 02:20:13.480
<i>I feel the lavender haze</i>

<i>But just never wiser</i>

2176
02:21:52.046 --> 02:21:55.049

2180
02:22:06.694 --> 02:22:09.897
<i>I should not be left</i>
<i>to my own devices</i>

2181
02:22:09.930 --> 02:22:12.566
<i>They come with prices</i>
<i>and vices</i>

2182
02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:14.135
<i>I end up in crisis</i>

2183
02:22:14.168 --> 02:22:17.004
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

2184
02:22:17.038 --> 02:22:19.640
<i>I wake up screaming</i>

2185
02:22:19.673 --> 02:22:21.942
<i>One day</i>
<i>I'll watch as you're leaving</i>

2186

<i>'Cause you got tired</i>

<i>For the last time</i>

02:22:26.147 --> 02:22:31.118
<i>It's me, hi</i>
<i>I'm the problem, it's me</i>

2189
02:22:31.152 --> 02:22:36.857
<i>At teatime, everybody agrees</i>

2190
02:22:36.891 --> 02:22:39.360
<i>I'll stare directly</i>
<i>at the sun</i>

2191
02:22:39.393 --> 02:22:41.062
<i>But never in the mirror</i>

2192
02:22:41.095 --> 02:22:46.734
<i>It must be exhausting always</i>
<i>rooting for the anti-hero</i>

2193
02:22:51.705 --> 02:22:56.877
<i>Sometimes, I feel like</i>
<i>everybody is a sexy baby</i>

2194
02:22:56.911 --> 02:22:59.613
<i>And I'm a monster on the hill</i>

2195
02:23:01.715 --> 02:23:02.950
<i>Too big to hang out</i>

2196
02:23:02.983 --> 02:23:06.654
<i>Slowly lurching toward</i>
<i>your favorite city</i>

2197
02:23:06.687 --> 02:23:09.156
<i>Pierced through the heart</i>
<i>but never killed</i>

2198
02:23:11.225 --> 02:23:14.695
<i>Did you hear</i>
<i>my covert narcissism</i>

2199
02:23:14.728 --> 02:23:16.864
<i>I disguise as altruism</i>

2200
02:23:16.897 --> 02:23:18.966
<i>Like some kind</i>

2201
02:23:18.999 --> 02:23:20.968
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

2202

02:23:23.838 --> 02:23:26.240
<i>One day</i>
<i>I'll watch as you're leaving</i>

2204
02:23:26.273 --> 02:23:28.843
<i>And life will lose</i>
<i>all its meaning</i>

2205
02:23:28.876 --> 02:23:30.177
<i>For the last time</i>

2206
02:23:30.211 --> 02:23:32.847
<i>It's me, hi</i>

<i>It must be exhausting always</i>
<i>rooting for the anti-hero</i>

2212
02:23:56.036 --> 02:23:57.037
<i>I have this dream</i>

2213
02:23:57.071 --> 02:24:00.908
<i>My daughter-in-law kills me</i>
<i>for the money</i>

2214
02:24:00.941 --> 02:24:03.911
<i>She thinks I left them</i>
<i>in the will</i>

2215
02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:08.749
<i>The family gathers 'round</i>
<i>and reads it</i>

2216
02:24:08.782 --> 02:24:10.885
<i>And then someone</i>
<i>screams out</i>

2217
02:24:10.918 --> 02:24:13.787
<i>"She's laughing up at us</i>
<i>from hell"</i>

2218
02:24:15.055 --> 02:24:18.025
<i>It's me, hi</i>

2219
02:24:18.058 --> 02:24:20.161
<i>I'm the problem, it's me</i>

2220
02:24:20.194 --> 02:24:22.730

<i>-Teatime</i>

2228

<i>-Everybody agrees</i>
<i>-Everybody agrees</i>

2229
02:24:45.886 --> 02:24:48.122

2232
02:25:08.075 --> 02:25:09.076
<i>Rain</i>

2233
02:25:09.109 --> 02:25:12.279
<i>He wanted it comfortable</i>
<i>I wanted that pain</i>

2234
02:25:12.313 --> 02:25:15.816
<i>He wanted a bride</i>
<i>I was making my own name</i>

2235
02:25:15.849 --> 02:25:17.251
<i>Chasing that fame</i>

2236
02:25:17.284 --> 02:25:19.186
<i>He stayed the same</i>

2237
02:25:19.220 --> 02:25:21.989
<i>All of me changed</i>
<i>Like midnight</i>

2238
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:38.973
<i>My town</i>
<i>was a wasteland</i>

2239
02:25:39.006 --> 02:25:40.841
<i>Full of cages, full of fences</i>

2240
02:25:40.874 --> 02:25:43.844
<i>Pageant queens</i>
<i>and big pretenders</i>

2241
02:25:43.877 --> 02:25:47.181
<i>But for some it was paradise</i>

2242
02:25:49.917 --> 02:25:52.386
<i>My boy was a montage</i>

2243
02:25:52.419 --> 02:25:54.255
<i>A slow motion, love potion</i>

2244
02:25:54.288 --> 02:25:57.258
<i>Jumping off things</i>
<i>in the ocean</i>

2245
02:25:57.291 --> 02:26:00.261
<i>I broke his heart</i>
<i>'cause he was nice</i>

2246
02:26:00.294 --> 02:26:02.863
<i>He was sunshine</i>
<i>I was midnight</i>

2247
02:26:02.896 --> 02:26:03.897
<i>Rain</i>

2248
02:26:03.931 --> 02:26:07.134
<i>He wanted it comfortable</i>
<i>I wanted that pain</i>

2249

<i>All of me changed</i>
<i>Like midnight</i>

2253
02:26:17.177 --> 02:26:20.147
<i>It came like a postcard</i>

2254
02:26:20.180 --> 02:26:22.016
<i>Picture perfect shiny family</i>

2255
02:26:22.049 --> 02:26:24.985
<i>Holiday peppermint candy</i>

2256
02:26:25.019 --> 02:26:27.788
<i>But for him it's every day</i>

2257
02:26:30.357 --> 02:26:33.894
<i>So I peered through a window</i>

2258
02:26:33.927 --> 02:26:35.429
<i>A deep portal, time travel</i>

2259
02:26:35.462 --> 02:26:37.898
<i>All the love we unravel</i>

2260
02:26:38.399 --> 02:26:41.201
<i>And the life I gave away</i>

2261
02:26:41.235 --> 02:26:45.105
<i>'Cause he was sunshine</i>
<i>I was midnight rain</i>

2262
02:26:45.139 --> 02:26:48.342
<i>He wanted it comfortable</i>
<i>I wanted that pain</i>

2263
02:26:48.375 --> 02:26:51.912
<i>He wanted a bride</i>
<i>I was making my own name</i>

<i>All of me changed</i>
<i>Like midnight</i>

2273
02:27:11.666 --> 02:27:14.301
<i>I guess sometimes we all get</i>

2274
02:27:14.335 --> 02:27:18.172
<i>Just what we wanted</i>
<i>Just what we wanted</i>

2275
02:27:18.205 --> 02:27:20.240
<i>And he never thinks of me</i>

2276
02:27:21.375 --> 02:27:23.410
<i>Except when I'm on TV</i>

2277
02:27:25.379 --> 02:27:28.115
<i>I guess sometimes we all get</i>

2278
02:27:28.148 --> 02:27:32.019
<i>Some kind of haunted</i>
<i>Some kind of haunted</i>

2279
02:27:32.052 --> 02:27:33.854
<i>And I never think of him</i>

2280
02:27:35.122 --> 02:27:37.458
<i>Except on midnights like this</i>

2281
02:27:37.491 --> 02:27:39.226
<i>Midnights like this</i>

2282
02:27:39.259 --> 02:27:41.862
<i>Midnights like this</i>

2283
02:27:56.176 --> 02:27:59.179
<i>Draw the cat eye</i>
<i>sharp enough to kill a man</i>

2284
02:28:01.982 --> 02:28:06.286
<i>You did some bad things</i>
<i>but I'm the worst of them</i>

2285
02:28:07.988 --> 02:28:11.291
<i>Sometimes I wonder which one</i>
<i>will be your last lie</i>

2286
02:28:13.961 --> 02:28:18.165
<i>They say looks can kill</i>
<i>and I might try</i>

2287
02:28:19.133 --> 02:28:21.201
<i>I don't dress for women</i>

2288
02:28:22.202 --> 02:28:24.271
<i>I don't dress for men</i>

2289
02:28:24.304 --> 02:28:27.307
<i>Lately I've been</i>
<i>dressing for revenge</i>

2290
02:28:29.109 --> 02:28:33.347
<i>I don't start shit, but</i>
<i>I can tell you how it ends</i>

2291
02:28:35.048 --> 02:28:39.052
<i>Don't get sad, get even</i>

2292
02:28:40.053 --> 02:28:43.023
<i>So on the weekends</i>

2293
02:28:43.056 --> 02:28:45.159

2295
02:28:49.597 --> 02:28:53.333
<i>She needed cold hard proof</i>
<i>so I gave her some</i>

2296
02:28:56.036 --> 02:28:57.271
<i>She had the envelope</i>

2297
02:28:57.304 --> 02:29:00.941
<i>Where you think</i>
<i>she got it from?</i>

2298
02:29:02.209 --> 02:29:03.310
<i>Now she gets the house</i>

2299
02:29:03.343 --> 02:29:05.446
<i>Gets the kids</i>
<i>Gets the pride</i>

2300
02:29:08.248 --> 02:29:12.986
<i>Picture me thick as thieves</i>
<i>with your ex-wife</i>

2301
02:29:13.020 --> 02:29:15.222
<i>And she looks so pretty</i>

2302
02:29:16.156 --> 02:29:18.258
<i>Driving in your Benz</i>

2303
02:29:18.292 --> 02:29:21.228
<i>Lately she's been</i>
<i>dressing for revenge</i>

2304
02:29:23.230 --> 02:29:24.064
<i>She don't start shit</i>

2305
02:29:24.097 --> 02:29:27.301
<i>But she can tell you</i>
<i>how it ends</i>

2306
02:29:28.636 --> 02:29:33.240
<i>Don't get sad, get even</i>

2307

<i>Ladies always rise above</i>

2311
02:29:46.821 --> 02:29:50.090
<i>Ladies know</i>

2312
02:29:50.123 --> 02:29:53.093
<i>Someone sweet</i>

2313
02:29:53.126 --> 02:29:58.098
<i>The lady simply had enough</i>

2314
02:29:58.131 --> 02:30:01.101
<i>While he was doing lines</i>

2315
02:30:01.134 --> 02:30:03.270
<i>And crossing all of mine</i>

2316
02:30:03.303 --> 02:30:06.541
<i>Someone told</i>
<i>his white collar crimes</i>

2317
02:30:06.574 --> 02:30:10.077
<i>To the FBI</i>

2318
02:30:10.110 --> 02:30:12.212
<i>And I don't</i>
<i>dress for villains</i>

2319
02:30:13.247 --> 02:30:15.215
<i>Or for innocents</i>

2320
02:30:15.249 --> 02:30:20.287
<i>I'm on my vigilante shit again</i>

2321
02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:24.157
<i>I don't start shit, but</i>
<i>I can tell you how it ends</i>

2322
02:30:26.093 --> 02:30:31.131
<i>Don't get sad, get even</i>

2323
02:30:31.164 --> 02:30:33.300
<i>So on the weekends</i>

2324
02:30:34.234 --> 02:30:36.270
<i>I don't dress for friends</i>

2325
02:30:36.303 --> 02:30:39.541
<i>Lately I've been</i>
<i>dressing for revenge</i>

2326
02:31:00.193 --> 02:31:04.164
<i>Baby love, I think I've been</i>
<i>a little too kind</i>

2327
02:31:06.266 --> 02:31:09.537
<i>Didn't notice you walking</i>
<i>all over my peace of mind</i>

2328
02:31:09.571 --> 02:31:11.438
<i>In the shoes</i>
<i>I gave you as a present</i>

2329
02:31:11.471 --> 02:31:13.575
<i>Putting someone first</i>
<i>only works</i>

2330
02:31:13.608 --> 02:31:15.543
<i>When you're in their top five</i>

2331
02:31:16.711 --> 02:31:18.345
<i>And by the way</i>

2332
02:31:19.714 --> 02:31:21.549
<i>I'm going out tonight</i>

2333
02:31:23.350 --> 02:31:25.218
<i>Best believe</i>
<i>I'm still bejeweled</i>

2334
02:31:25.252 --> 02:31:26.554
<i>When I walk in the room</i>

2335
02:31:26.588 --> 02:31:29.389
<i>I can still make</i>
<i>the whole place shimmer</i>

2336
02:31:29.423 --> 02:31:30.625
<i>And when I meet the band</i>

2337
02:31:30.658 --> 02:31:32.359
<i>They ask</i>
<i>"Do you have a man?"</i>

2338
02:31:32.392 --> 02:31:35.228
<i>I could still say</i>
<i>"I don't remember"</i>

2339
02:31:35.262 --> 02:31:38.432
<i>Familiarity breeds contempt</i>
<i>Don't put me in the basement</i>

2340
02:31:38.465 --> 02:31:41.234
<i>When I want the penthouse</i>
<i>of your heart</i>

2341
02:31:41.268 --> 02:31:43.738
<i>Diamonds in my eyes</i>

2342
02:31:43.771 --> 02:31:48.108
<i>I polish up real</i>
<i>I polish up real nice</i>

2343
02:31:52.212 --> 02:31:53.213
<i>Nice</i>

2344
02:31:58.586 --> 02:32:02.422
<i>Baby boy, I think I've been</i>
<i>too good of a girl</i>

2345
02:32:02.456 --> 02:32:04.592
<i>Too good of a girl</i>

2346
02:32:04.626 --> 02:32:08.362
<i>Did all the extra credit</i>
<i>Then got graded on a curve</i>

2347
02:32:08.395 --> 02:32:10.230
<i>I think it's time</i>
<i>to teach some lessons</i>

2348
02:32:10.263 --> 02:32:12.299
<i>I made you my world</i>
<i>Have you heard?</i>

2349
02:32:12.332 --> 02:32:14.468
<i>I can reclaim the land</i>

2350
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:17.504
<i>And I miss you</i>

2351
02:32:18.372 --> 02:32:20.708
<i>But I miss sparkling</i>

2352
02:32:20.742 --> 02:32:21.576
<i>Nice</i>

2353
02:32:21.609 --> 02:32:23.645
<i>Best believe</i>
<i>I'm still bejeweled</i>

2354
02:32:23.678 --> 02:32:25.278

2365
02:32:59.279 --> 02:33:02.684
<i>Sadness became my whole sky</i>

2366
02:33:02.717 --> 02:33:05.687
<i>But some guy said</i>
<i>my aura's moonstone</i>

2367
02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:08.990
<i>Just 'cause he was high</i>

2368

<i>To change my mind</i>

2371
02:33:13.594 --> 02:33:15.663

2372
02:33:15.697 --> 02:33:17.565

2373
02:33:17.598 --> 02:33:20.568

<i>At the same time</i>

2398
02:34:35.910 --> 02:34:39.714

2399
02:34:39.747 --> 02:34:43.618
<i>Of a chain reaction</i>

2402
02:34:50.625 --> 02:34:53.628

2403
02:34:53.661 --> 02:34:55.530

<i>Nothing was gonna stop me</i>

2405
02:34:57.698 --> 02:35:01.569
<i>I laid the groundwork</i>

2406
02:35:01.602 --> 02:35:03.938
<i>The dominoes</i>
<i>cascaded in a line</i>

2407

<i>It was all my design</i>

2410
02:35:15.883 --> 02:35:18.853
<i>'Cause I'm a mastermind</i>

2411
02:35:21.756 --> 02:35:27.929
<i>You see all the wisest women</i>
<i>had to do it this way</i>

2412
02:35:29.730 --> 02:35:31.732
<i>'Cause we were born to be</i>

2413
02:35:31.766 --> 02:35:35.937
<i>The pawn</i>
<i>in every lover's game</i>

2414

02:35:44.779 --> 02:35:48.916
<i>I'm the wind</i>

2417
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:51.484
<i>And the liquor</i>
<i>in our cocktails</i>

2418
02:35:51.519 --> 02:35:54.622
<i>What if I told you</i>
<i>none of it was accidental?</i>

2419
02:35:54.655 --> 02:35:56.624
<i>And the first night</i>
<i>that you saw me</i>

2420
02:35:56.657 --> 02:35:58.559
<i>I knew I wanted your body</i>

2421
02:35:58.593 --> 02:36:02.563
<i>I laid the groundwork</i>

<i>'Cause I'm a mastermind</i>

2427
02:36:22.049 --> 02:36:25.720
<i>No one wanted to play</i>
<i>with me as a little kid</i>

2428
02:36:25.753 --> 02:36:29.590
<i>So I've been scheming</i>
<i>like a criminal ever since</i>

2429
02:36:29.624 --> 02:36:33.493
<i>To make them love me</i>
<i>and make it seem effortless</i>

2430
02:36:33.527 --> 02:36:36.697
<i>This is the first time I've</i>
<i>felt the need to confess</i>

2431
02:36:36.731 --> 02:36:39.934
<i>And I swear</i>

2432
02:36:39.967 --> 02:36:42.904
<i>I'm only cryptic</i>
<i>and Machiavellian</i>

2433
02:36:42.937 --> 02:36:45.039
<i>'Cause I care</i>

2434
02:36:45.072 --> 02:36:47.909
<i>So I told you none of it</i>
<i>was accidental</i>

2435
02:36:47.942 --> 02:36:49.810
<i>And the first night</i>
<i>that you saw me</i>

2436

<i>Nothing was gonna stop me</i>

2437
02:36:51.946 --> 02:36:55.783
<i>I laid the groundwork</i>
<i>and then saw a wide smirk</i>

2438
02:36:55.816 --> 02:36:58.786
<i>On your face</i>
<i>You knew the entire time</i>

2439
02:36:58.819 --> 02:37:01.789
<i>You knew</i>
<i>that I'm a mastermind</i>

2440
02:37:03.557 --> 02:37:05.559
<i>And now you're mine</i>

2441
02:37:06.594 --> 02:37:08.930
<i>Yeah, all you did</i>
<i>was smile</i>

2442
02:37:10.264 --> 02:37:13.968
<i>'Cause I'm a mastermind</i>

2443
02:37:34.588 --> 02:37:35.823
<i>You have absolutely given us</i>

2444
02:37:35.856 --> 02:37:37.725
<i>everything</i>
<i>that you have tonight,</i>

2445
02:37:38.726 --> 02:37:40.895
<i>so I feel guilty asking...</i>

2446
02:37:40.928 --> 02:37:43.731
<i>but could we have one more</i>
<i>song's worth of your time?</i>

2447
02:37:56.544 --> 02:37:58.980
<i>You're talking shit</i>
<i>for the hell of it</i>

2448
02:37:59.013 --> 02:38:01.816
<i>Addicted to betrayal</i>
<i>but you're relevant</i>

2449
02:38:01.849 --> 02:38:04.852
<i>You're terrified to look down</i>

2450
02:38:06.921 --> 02:38:09.724
<i>'Cause if you dare</i>
<i>You'll see the glare</i>

2451
02:38:09.757 --> 02:38:12.593
<i>Of everyone you burned</i>
<i>just to get there</i>

2452
02:38:12.626 --> 02:38:15.529

2454
02:38:22.636 --> 02:38:26.540
<i>You wouldn't know</i>
<i>what I mean</i>

2455
02:38:27.842 --> 02:38:31.579
<i>'Cause karma is my boyfriend</i>
<i>Karma is a god</i>

2456
02:38:31.612 --> 02:38:34.715

2458

02:39:40.881 --> 02:39:43.651
<i>Me and karma vibe like that</i>

2479
02:39:43.684 --> 02:39:45.920
<i>Ask me what I learned</i>
<i>from all those years</i>

2480
02:39:45.953 --> 02:39:48.856
<i>Ask me what I earned</i>
<i>from all those tears</i>

2481
02:39:48.889 --> 02:39:52.693
<i>Ask me why so many fade</i>
<i>but I'm still here</i>

2482
02:39:52.726 --> 02:39:55.963
<i>I'm still, I'm still here</i>

2483
02:39:55.996 --> 02:39:59.400
<i>'Cause karma is the thunder</i>
<i>Rattling your ground</i>

2484
02:39:59.433 --> 02:40:02.670
<i>Karma's on your scent</i>
<i>like a bounty hunter</i>

2485
02:40:02.703 --> 02:40:04.839
<i>Karma's gonna</i>
<i>track you down</i>

2486
02:40:04.872 --> 02:40:07.174
<i>Step by step</i>
<i>from town to town</i>

2487
02:40:07.208 --> 02:40:10.077
<i>Sweet like justice</i>
<i>Karma is a queen</i>

2488
02:40:10.111 --> 02:40:13.247
<i>Karma takes all my friends</i>
<i>to the summit</i>

2489
02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:15.416
<i>Karma is the guy</i>
<i>on the screen</i>

2490
02:40:15.449 --> 02:40:17.184
<i>Coming straight home to me</i>

2491
02:40:17.218 --> 02:40:19.053
<i>'Cause karma is my boyfriend</i>

2492
02:40:19.086 --> 02:40:20.788
<i>Karma is a god</i>

2493
02:40:20.821 --> 02:40:23.991
<i>Karma is the breeze</i>
<i>in my hair on the weekend</i>

2494
02:40:24.024 --> 02:40:26.093
<i>Karma's a relaxing thought</i>

2495
02:40:26.127 --> 02:40:28.863
<i>Aren't you envious</i>
<i>that for you it's not?</i>

2496
02:40:28.896 --> 02:40:31.665
<i>Sweet like honey</i>
<i>Karma is a cat</i>

2497
02:40:31.699 --> 02:40:33.868
<i>Purring in my lap</i>
<i>'cause it loves me</i>

2498
02:40:33.901 --> 02:40:36.837
<i>Flexing like</i>
<i>a goddamn acrobat</i>

2499
02:40:36.871 --> 02:40:39.039
<i>Me and karma vibe like that</i>

2500
02:40:39.073 --> 02:40:40.875
<i>Ah</i>

2501
02:40:40.908 --> 02:40:43.144
<i>Karma is my boyfriend</i>

2502

<i>-Karma is a god</i>
<i>-Ah</i>

2503
02:40:47.715 --> 02:40:50.217
<i>Uh-huh, mm</i>

2504
02:40:50.251 --> 02:40:51.752
<i>Ah</i>

2505
02:40:51.785 --> 02:40:56.023
<i>Karma's a relaxing thought</i>

2506
02:40:56.056 --> 02:41:00.761
<i>Ah</i>

2507
02:41:00.794 --> 02:41:06.167
<i>L.A., every single person on</i>

2508
02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:09.170
<i>So will you please</i>
<i>show that love right back</i>

2509
02:41:09.203 --> 02:41:11.105
<i>to my amazing dancers!</i>

2510
02:41:22.850 --> 02:41:25.819
<i>And now,</i>
<i>please make some noise</i>

2511
02:41:25.853 --> 02:41:28.822

2513
02:41:36.797 --> 02:41:38.232
<i>to the main stage</i>

2514
02:41:38.265 --> 02:41:41.702
<i>and give it up</i>
<i>for my phenomenal band!</i>

2515
02:43:55.369 --> 02:43:57.371
<i>Combat</i>

2516
02:43:58.238 --> 02:44:01.108
<i>I'm ready for combat</i>

2517
02:44:02.042 --> 02:44:05.012
<i>I say I don't want that</i>

2518
02:44:06.013 --> 02:44:07.915
<i>But what if I do?</i>

2519
02:44:10.417 --> 02:44:13.655
<i>'Cause cruelty</i>

2520
02:44:13.688 --> 02:44:16.857
<i>Wins in the movies</i>

2521
02:44:17.991 --> 02:44:20.994
<i>I've got 100</i>
<i>thrown-out speeches</i>

2522
02:44:21.028 --> 02:44:23.864
<i>I almost said to you</i>

2523
02:44:25.966 --> 02:44:29.236
<i>Easy they come</i>
<i>Easy they go</i>

2524
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:33.207
<i>I jump from the train</i>
<i>I ride off alone</i>

2525
02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:37.344
<i>I never grew up</i>
<i>It's getting so old</i>

2526
02:44:37.378 --> 02:44:40.314
<i>Help me hold onto you</i>

2527
02:44:40.347 --> 02:44:44.051
<i>I've been the archer</i>

2528
02:44:44.084 --> 02:44:46.887
<i>I've been the prey</i>

2529
02:44:48.288 --> 02:44:51.693
<i>Who could ever</i>
<i>leave me, darling?</i>

2530
02:44:51.726 --> 02:44:54.495
<i>But who could stay?</i>

2531
02:44:57.064 --> 02:44:59.233
<i>Dark side</i>

2532
02:44:59.266 --> 02:45:03.137
<i>I search for your dark side</i>

2533
02:45:03.170 --> 02:45:06.173
<i>But what if I'm all right</i>

2534
02:45:06.206 --> 02:45:10.377
<i>Right, right, right here?</i>

2535
02:45:11.746 --> 02:45:14.448
<i>And I cut off</i>

2536
02:45:14.481 --> 02:45:18.952
<i>My nose</i>
<i>just to spite my face</i>

2537
02:45:18.986 --> 02:45:22.489
<i>Then I hate my reflection</i>

2538
02:45:22.524 --> 02:45:25.325
<i>For years and years</i>

2539
02:45:27.261 --> 02:45:31.198
<i>I wake in the night</i>
<i>I pace like a ghost</i>

2540
02:45:31.231 --> 02:45:35.068
<i>The room is on fire</i>
<i>Invisible smoke</i>

2541
02:45:35.102 --> 02:45:39.173
<i>And all of my heroes</i>
<i>die all alone</i>

2542
02:45:39.206 --> 02:45:42.042
<i>Help me hold onto you</i>

2543
02:45:42.075 --> 02:45:45.312
<i>I've been the archer</i>

2544
02:45:45.345 --> 02:45:49.316
<i>I've been the prey</i>

2545
02:45:49.349 --> 02:45:52.754
<i>Screaming, who could</i>
<i>ever leave me, darling...</i>

2546
02:45:52.787 --> 02:45:56.190
<i>But who could stay?</i>

2547
02:45:58.091 --> 02:46:00.194
<i>'Cause they see</i>
<i>right through me</i>

2548
02:46:00.227 --> 02:46:02.095
<i>They see right through me</i>

2549
02:46:02.129 --> 02:46:03.497
<i>They see right through</i>

2550
02:46:03.531 --> 02:46:05.567
<i>Can you see right through me?</i>

2551
02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:07.401
<i>They see right through</i>

2552
02:46:07.434 --> 02:46:09.470
<i>They see right through me</i>

2553
02:46:09.503 --> 02:46:11.472
<i>I see right through me</i>

2554
02:46:11.505 --> 02:46:13.474
<i>I see right through me</i>

2555
02:46:13.507 --> 02:46:17.211
<i>All the king's horses</i>
<i>All the king's men</i>

2556
02:46:17.244 --> 02:46:21.081
<i>Couldn't put me</i>
<i>together again</i>

2557
02:46:21.114 --> 02:46:24.619
<i>'Cause all of my enemies</i>
<i>started out friends</i>

2558
02:46:24.652 --> 02:46:28.055
<i>Help me hold onto you</i>

2559
02:46:28.088 --> 02:46:31.158

02:46:43.403 --> 02:46:47.140
<i>Who could stay?</i>

2564
02:46:47.174 --> 02:46:49.544
<i>Who could stay?</i>

2565
02:46:51.144 --> 02:46:54.114
<i>Who could stay?</i>

2566
02:46:55.115 --> 02:46:58.085
<i>Who could stay?</i>

2567
02:46:59.119 --> 02:47:01.121
<i>You could stay</i>

2568
02:47:07.494 --> 02:47:10.163
<i>Combat</i>

2569
02:47:10.197 --> 02:47:15.202
<i>I'm ready for combat</i>

2570
02:47:38.626 --> 02:47:42.429
<i>He said</i>
<i>"Let's get out of this town"</i>

2571
02:47:42.462 --> 02:47:46.099
<i>Drive out of this city</i>
<i>away from the crowds</i>

2572
02:47:46.133 --> 02:47:49.303
<i>I thought</i>
<i>"Heaven can't help me now"</i>

2573
02:47:49.336 --> 02:47:51.338
<i>Nothing lasts forever</i>

2574

<i>But this is gonna</i>
<i>take me down</i>

2575
02:47:54.474 --> 02:47:57.311
<i>He's so tall</i>
<i>and handsome as hell</i>

2576
02:47:57.344 --> 02:48:00.447
<i>He's so bad</i>
<i>but he does it so well</i>

2577
02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:03.585
<i>I can see the end</i>
<i>as it begins</i>

2578
02:48:03.618 --> 02:48:06.621
<i>My one condition is...</i>

2579
02:48:06.654 --> 02:48:09.591
<i>Say you'll remember me</i>

2580
02:48:09.624 --> 02:48:13.895
<i>Standing in a nice dress</i>
<i>Staring at the sunset, babe</i>

2581
02:48:13.928 --> 02:48:16.463
<i>Red lips and rosy cheeks</i>

2582
02:48:16.496 --> 02:48:20.702
<i>Say you'll see me again</i>
<i>Even if it's just in your</i>

2583
02:48:20.735 --> 02:48:23.470
<i>Wildest dreams</i>

2584
02:48:23.503 --> 02:48:26.306
<i>Ah-ah, ha</i>

2585
02:48:27.642 --> 02:48:30.545
<i>Wildest dreams</i>

2586
02:48:30.578 --> 02:48:32.647
<i>Ah-ah, ha</i>

2587
02:48:34.616 --> 02:48:38.352
<i>You'll see me in hindsight</i>
<i>Tangled up with you all night</i>

2588
02:48:38.385 --> 02:48:41.254
<i>Burning it down</i>

2589
02:48:41.288 --> 02:48:44.926
<i>Someday when you leave me</i>
<i>I bet these memories</i>

2590
02:48:44.959 --> 02:48:47.929
<i>Follow you around...</i>

2591
02:48:47.962 --> 02:48:51.766
<i>You'll see me in hindsight</i>
<i>Tangled up with you all night</i>

2592

<i>Burning it down</i>

2593
02:48:55.202 --> 02:48:58.640
<i>Someday when you leave me</i>
<i>I bet these memories</i>

2594
02:48:58.673 --> 02:49:01.609
<i>Follow you around...</i>

2595
02:49:01.643 --> 02:49:05.479
<i>You'll see me in hindsight</i>
<i>Tangled up with you all night</i>

2596

<i>Burning it down</i>

2597

<i>Follow you around</i>

2599
02:49:15.455 --> 02:49:19.326
<i>You'll see me in hindsight</i>

<i>Follow you around</i>

2603
02:49:28.770 --> 02:49:32.640
<i>Follow you around</i>

2604
02:50:13.881 --> 02:50:17.250
<i>I said</i>
<i>Remember this moment</i>

2605
02:50:18.820 --> 02:50:22.322
<i>In the back of my mind</i>

2606
02:50:23.558 --> 02:50:27.427
<i>The time we stood</i>
<i>with our shaking hands</i>

2607
02:50:27.461 --> 02:50:31.331
<i>The crowds in stands went wild</i>

2608
02:50:32.867 --> 02:50:36.503
<i>We were</i>
<i>the kings and the queens</i>

2609
02:50:37.805 --> 02:50:42.342
<i>And they read off our names</i>

2610
02:50:42.375 --> 02:50:45.880
<i>The night you danced like</i>
<i>you knew our lives</i>

2611
02:50:45.913 --> 02:50:49.851
<i>Would never be the same</i>

2612
02:50:51.686 --> 02:50:54.789
<i>You held your head</i>
<i>like a hero</i>

2613
02:50:56.657 --> 02:50:59.827
<i>On a history book page</i>

2614
02:51:00.928 --> 02:51:04.498
<i>It was the end of a decade</i>

2615
02:51:05.867 --> 02:51:09.402
<i>But the start of an age</i>

2616
02:51:11.839 --> 02:51:15.610
<i>Long live</i>
<i>the walls we crashed through</i>

2617
02:51:15.643 --> 02:51:19.781
<i>How the kingdom lights shined</i>
<i>just for me and you</i>

2618
02:51:19.814 --> 02:51:24.585
<i>I was screaming</i>
<i>Long live</i>
<i>all the magic we made</i>

2619
02:51:24.619 --> 02:51:28.089
<i>And bring on</i>
<i>all the pretenders</i>

2620
02:51:28.122 --> 02:51:32.627
<i>One day</i>
<i>we will be remembered</i>

2621
02:51:33.828 --> 02:51:37.297
<i>I said</i>
<i>Remember this feeling</i>

2622
02:51:38.633 --> 02:51:41.903
<i>I pass the pictures around</i>

2623
02:51:43.638 --> 02:51:46.541
<i>Of all the years</i>
<i>that we stood there</i>

2624
02:51:46.574 --> 02:51:51.813
<i>On the sidelines</i>
<i>wishing for right now</i>

2625
02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:56.483
<i>We are</i>
<i>the kings and the queens</i>

2626
02:51:56.517 --> 02:52:00.822
<i>You traded your baseball cap</i>
<i>for a crown</i>

2627
02:52:02.723 --> 02:52:05.860
<i>When they gave us</i>
<i>our trophies</i>

2628
02:52:05.893 --> 02:52:10.798
<i>And we held them up</i>
<i>for our town</i>

2629
02:52:11.933 --> 02:52:15.703
<i>And the cynics were outraged</i>

2630
02:52:16.804 --> 02:52:20.908
<i>Screaming, this is absurd</i>

2631
02:52:20.942 --> 02:52:27.380
<i>'Cause for a moment</i>
<i>a band of thieves</i>
<i>in ripped-up jeans</i>

2632
02:52:27.414 --> 02:52:32.385
<i>Got to rule the world</i>

2633
02:52:32.419 --> 02:52:35.723
<i>Long live the walls</i>
<i>we crashed through</i>

2634
02:52:35.756 --> 02:52:39.827
<i>How the kingdom lights shined</i>
<i>just for me and you</i>

2635
02:52:39.861 --> 02:52:44.665
<i>I was screaming</i>
<i>Long live</i>
<i>all the magic we made</i>

2636
02:52:44.699 --> 02:52:50.805
<i>And bring on</i>
<i>all the pretenders</i>
<i>I'm not afraid</i>

2637
02:52:50.838 --> 02:52:53.975
<i>Long live</i>
<i>all the mountains we moved</i>

2638
02:52:54.008 --> 02:52:59.180
<i>I had the time of my life</i>
<i>fighting dragons with you</i>

2639
02:52:59.213 --> 02:53:03.584
<i>I was screaming</i>
<i>Long live</i>
<i>that look on your face</i>

2640
02:53:03.618 --> 02:53:06.954
<i>And bring on</i>
<i>all the pretenders</i>

2641
02:53:06.988 --> 02:53:11.559
<i>One day</i>
<i>we will be remembered</i>

2642
02:53:15.495 --> 02:53:18.733
<i>Hold on</i>
<i>to spinning around</i>

2643
02:53:18.766 --> 02:53:23.604
<i>Confetti falls</i>
<i>to the ground</i>

2644
02:53:23.638 --> 02:53:30.511
<i>May these memories</i>
<i>break our fall</i>

2645
02:53:32.546 --> 02:53:34.949
<i>Will you take a moment</i>

2646
02:53:37.652 --> 02:53:39.486
<i>Promise me this</i>

2647
02:53:41.555 --> 02:53:44.926
<i>That you'll</i>
<i>stand by me forever</i>

2648
02:53:44.959 --> 02:53:48.663
<i>But if, God forbid</i>
<i>Fate should step in</i>

2649
02:53:50.831 --> 02:53:54.568
<i>-And force us into a goodbye</i>
-

2650
02:53:55.569 --> 02:53:58.572
<i>If you have children someday</i>

2651
02:54:00.641 --> 02:54:03.678
<i>When they point</i>
<i>to the pictures</i>

2652
02:54:05.012 --> 02:54:07.480
<i>Please tell them my name</i>

2653
02:54:10.051 --> 02:54:14.956
<i>Tell them how</i>
<i>the crowds went wild</i>

2654
02:54:14.989 --> 02:54:19.459
<i>Tell them how</i>
<i>I hope they shine</i>

2655
02:54:20.661 --> 02:54:23.831
<i>Long live</i>
<i>the walls we crashed through</i>

2656
02:54:23.864 --> 02:54:26.867
<i>I had the time of my life</i>

2657
02:54:26.901 --> 02:54:29.603
<i>With you</i>

2658
02:54:29.637 --> 02:54:33.641
<i>Long, long live</i>
<i>the walls we crashed through</i>

2659
02:54:33.674 --> 02:54:37.645
<i>How the kingdom lights shined</i>
<i>just for me and you</i>

2660
02:54:37.678 --> 02:54:42.016
<i>And I was screaming</i>
<i>Long live</i>
<i>all the magic we made</i>

2661
02:54:42.049 --> 02:54:47.989
<i>And bring on</i>
<i>all the pretenders</i>
<i>I'm not afraid</i>

2662
02:54:48.022 --> 02:54:51.959
<i>Singing long live</i>
<i>all the mountains we moved</i>

2663
02:54:51.993 --> 02:54:57.064
<i>I had the time of my life</i>
<i>fighting dragons with you</i>

2664
02:54:57.098 --> 02:55:01.135
<i>And long, long live</i>
<i>the look on your face</i>

2665
02:55:01.168 --> 02:55:05.072
<i>And bring on</i>
<i>all the pretenders</i>

2666
02:55:05.106 --> 02:55:07.041
<i>One day</i>

2667
02:55:09.076 --> 02:55:11.812
<i>We will be remembered</i>

2668
02:55:44.979 --> 02:55:48.015
<i>I said</i>
<i>Remember this moment</i>

2669
02:55:49.850 --> 02:55:52.853
<i>In the back of my mind</i>

2670
02:55:54.688 --> 02:55:58.192
<i>The time we stood</i>
<i>with our shaking hands</i>

2671
02:55:58.225 --> 02:56:02.696
<i>The crowds in stands went wild</i>

2672
02:56:03.964 --> 02:56:07.601
<i>We were</i>
<i>the kings and the queens</i>

2673
02:56:08.936 --> 02:56:13.074
<i>And they read off our names</i>

2674
02:56:13.107 --> 02:56:16.977
<i>The night you danced like</i>
<i>you knew our lives</i>

2675
02:56:17.011 --> 02:56:20.981
<i>Would never be the same</i>

2676
02:56:22.817 --> 02:56:25.886
<i>You held your head</i>
<i>like a hero</i>

2677
02:56:27.922 --> 02:56:30.958
<i>On a history book page</i>

2678
02:56:32.026 --> 02:56:35.596
<i>It was the end of a decade</i>

2679
02:56:37.431 --> 02:56:40.601
<i>But the start of an age</i>

2680
02:56:43.104 --> 02:56:46.841
<i>Long live</i>
<i>the walls we crashed through</i>

2681
02:56:46.874 --> 02:56:51.145
<i>How the kingdom lights shined</i>
<i>just for me and you</i>

2682
02:56:51.178 --> 02:56:55.983
<i>I was screaming</i>
<i>Long live</i>
<i>all the magic we made</i>

2683
02:56:56.016 --> 02:56:59.220
<i>And bring on</i>
<i>all the pretenders</i>

2684
02:56:59.253 --> 02:57:03.891
<i>One day</i>
<i>we will be remembered</i>

2685
02:57:04.959 --> 02:57:08.696
<i>I said</i>
<i>Remember this feeling</i>

2686
02:57:09.897 --> 02:57:13.033
<i>I'll pass the pictures around</i>

2687
02:57:14.768 --> 02:57:18.239
<i>Of all the years</i>
<i>that we stood there</i>

2688
02:57:18.272 --> 02:57:22.910
<i>On the sidelines</i>
<i>wishing for right now</i>

2689
02:57:24.011 --> 02:57:27.982
<i>We are</i>
<i>the kings and the queens</i>

2690
02:57:28.015 --> 02:57:31.919
<i>You traded your baseball cap</i>
<i>for a crown</i>

2691
02:57:33.988 --> 02:57:37.458
<i>When they gave us</i>
<i>our trophies</i>

2692
02:57:37.491 --> 02:57:43.130
<i>And we held them up</i>
<i>for our town</i>

2693
02:57:43.164 --> 02:57:46.800
<i>And the cynics were outraged</i>

2694
02:57:47.935 --> 02:57:52.173
<i>Screaming, this is absurd</i>

2695
02:57:52.206 --> 02:57:58.045
<i>'Cause for a moment</i>
<i>a band of thieves</i>
<i>in ripped-up jeans</i>

2696
02:57:58.078 --> 02:58:03.150
<i>Got to rule the world</i>

2697
02:58:03.184 --> 02:58:06.854
<i>Long live the walls</i>
<i>we crashed through</i>

2698
02:58:06.887 --> 02:58:11.192
<i>How the kingdom lights shined</i>
<i>just for me and you</i>

2699
02:58:11.225 --> 02:58:16.096
<i>I was screaming</i>
<i>Long live</i>
<i>all the magic we made</i>

2700
02:58:16.130 --> 02:58:21.869
<i>And bring on</i>
<i>all the pretenders</i>
<i>I'm not afraid</i>

2701
02:58:21.902 --> 02:58:25.739
<i>Long live</i>
<i>all the mountains we moved</i>

2702
02:58:25.773 --> 02:58:30.211
<i>I had the time of my life</i>
<i>fighting dragons with you</i>

2703
02:58:30.244 --> 02:58:35.049
<i>I was screaming</i>
<i>Long live</i>
<i>that look on your face</i>

2704
02:58:35.082 --> 02:58:38.085
<i>And bring on</i>
<i>all the pretenders</i>

2705
02:58:38.118 --> 02:58:42.323
<i>One day</i>
<i>we will be remembered</i>

2706
02:58:46.260 --> 02:58:50.030
<i>Hold on</i>
<i>to spinning around</i>

2707
02:58:50.064 --> 02:58:55.002
<i>Confetti falls to the ground</i>

2708
02:58:55.035 --> 02:59:01.275
<i>May these memories</i>
<i>break our fall</i>

2709
02:59:03.277 --> 02:59:06.280
<i>Will you take a moment</i>

2710
02:59:08.415 --> 02:59:11.151
<i>Promise me this</i>

2711
02:59:12.286 --> 02:59:16.190
<i>That you'll</i>
<i>stand by me forever</i>

2712
02:59:16.223 --> 02:59:19.760
<i>But if, God forbid</i>
<i>Fate should step in</i>

2713
02:59:21.962 --> 02:59:25.299
<i>And force us into a goodbye</i>

2714
02:59:26.333 --> 02:59:29.336
<i>If you have children someday</i>

2715
02:59:31.905 --> 02:59:34.775
<i>When they point</i>
<i>to the pictures</i>

2716
02:59:36.310 --> 02:59:39.079
<i>Please tell them my name</i>

2717
02:59:41.616 --> 02:59:46.153
<i>Tell them how</i>
<i>the crowds went wild</i>

2718
02:59:46.186 --> 02:59:51.392
<i>Tell them how</i>
<i>I hope they shine</i>

2719
02:59:51.425 --> 02:59:54.928
<i>Long live</i>
<i>the walls we crashed through</i>

2720
02:59:54.962 --> 02:59:57.998
<i>I had the time of my life</i>

2721
02:59:58.032 --> 03:00:00.367
<i>With you</i>

2722
03:00:00.401 --> 03:00:04.405
<i>Long, long live</i>
<i>the walls we crashed through</i>

2723
03:00:04.438 --> 03:00:09.076
<i>How the kingdom lights shined</i>
