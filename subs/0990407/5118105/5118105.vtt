00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.470
Daily Sentinel.

2
00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:58.995
One minute, please.

3
00:01:01.174 --> 00:01:04.701
The mayor doesn't want the
article to go to print

4
00:01:04.878 --> 00:01:06.869
until after the next quarter.

5
00:01:07.047 --> 00:01:09.311
Tell the mayor I'm insulted.

6
00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:10.843
I would never jeopardise the

7
00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:12.884
journalistic integrity
of this newspaper

8
00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:15.419
for some rent-a-mayor's
political agenda.

9
00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:16.622
Very well, mister.

10
00:01:20.427 --> 00:01:21.826
So, Britt.

11
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.229
Here we are again.

12
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:29.233
Sent home after another
schoolyard fight.

13
00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:31.533
I know you miss your mother.

14
00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:33.334
So do I.

15
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:38.205
But I have to take
care of 750 employees

16
00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:41.006
and you have to take
care of yourself.

17
00:01:41.748 --> 00:01:45.878
Still, that seems to
be asking too much.

18
00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.701
I was trying to stop some
bullies and the guy hit me.

19
00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:51.415
Trying doesn't matter
when you always fail.

20
00:01:53.794 --> 00:01:55.728
No. No.

21
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:02.059
Do you think it makes
me happy to do this?

22
00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:03.896
- Yes.
- No, it doesn't.

23
00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:08.068
But not a week goes by without
you finding yourself in trouble.

24
00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:10.338
If you're doing
this for attention,

25
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.808
you have all that I can
afford to give you.

26
00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.776
And you're wasting my time.

27
00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:49.846
Frank.

28
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.849
No, no. Not you.

29
00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:07.263
Have a seat.

30
00:03:08.235 --> 00:03:10.931
Either one. They're
both very comfortable.

31
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.504
So, what can I do for you?

32
00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:19.678
As you know,

33
00:03:20.013 --> 00:03:24.243
I've worked my entire life,
very hard, to achieve one goal.

34
00:03:24.584 --> 00:03:25.608
Huh.

35
00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:29.282
And that goal, which I
have, in fact, achieved,

36
00:03:29.756 --> 00:03:33.317
was to be in charge of all the
crime in the city of Los Angeles.

37
00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:38.556
Therefore, the fact that
you assume that you can

38
00:03:38.732 --> 00:03:41.166
open this establishment
without my permission,

39
00:03:41.334 --> 00:03:43.645
without payment, and
sell narcotics out

40
00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:45.668
of it, is completely unacceptable.

41
00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:47.006
Really?

42
00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:49.705
And, to be honest,
quite insulting.

43
00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:53.881
Therefore, you must sign over
ownership of this establishment

44
00:03:53.882 --> 00:03:57.007
to me, at which time, you
become my employees.

45
00:03:57.584 --> 00:03:58.881
We're your employees?

46
00:03:59.052 --> 00:04:00.417
Yeah.

47
00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:01.986
Or close down permanently.

48
00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:03.481
Choice is yours.

49
00:04:03.657 --> 00:04:05.852
Okay. How do I
pronounce your name?

50
00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:07.853
Tchaikovsky?

51
00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:09.320
Chudnofsky.

52
00:04:09.496 --> 00:04:11.054
Char... Chudofsk...

53
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:12.528
Chowdofsky?

54
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.698
Chud-nof-sky.

55
00:04:20.073 --> 00:04:21.665
Chudnofsky?

56
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:24.674
All right. Chudnofsky,
kiss my ass.

57
00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:30.676
Put your lips to my ass and
kiss it. French kiss it.

58
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.943
Tickle it with your grey whiskers.

59
00:04:33.353 --> 00:04:35.344
I got bittersweet news for you.

60
00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:37.279
You're washed-up.

61
00:04:37.457 --> 00:04:40.221
You're old. You're boring.
You're not scary.

62
00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:42.122
You dress like shit.

63
00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:45.389
It's over for you, okay?
That's the bitter news.

64
00:04:45.565 --> 00:04:47.192
Now the sweet news is:

65
00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:48.595
You can retire.

66
00:04:49.035 --> 00:04:50.900
You can go play golf,

67
00:04:51.137 --> 00:04:54.470
eat your dinners at
3:00 in the afternoon,

68
00:04:54.908 --> 00:04:59.368
play with your grandkids, drink
Metamucil, old people shit.

69
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.777
Okay? Look at me.

70
00:05:02.582 --> 00:05:04.641
I got a name people can say.

71
00:05:04.851 --> 00:05:06.580
My name's Danny Clear.

72
00:05:06.886 --> 00:05:08.615
I deal crystal meth.

73
00:05:09.255 --> 00:05:11.746
People call me Crystal
Clear. It's easy.

74
00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.550
Check out my kick-ass
hangout here.

75
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:17.421
I got shitloads of
glass everywhere.

76
00:05:17.597 --> 00:05:18.962
I got a see-through piano.

77
00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:21.161
Look at my boys.

78
00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:23.166
They're pimped out.

79
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.603
We got Gucci, Armani,
another Gucci, tailor-made.

80
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:33.401
This is what you need to
get to the top today.

81
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.013
Not hard work.

82
00:05:35.181 --> 00:05:37.479
Not dressing like
Disco Santa Claus.

83
00:05:37.817 --> 00:05:39.409
You need charisma.

84
00:05:39.586 --> 00:05:41.019
You look like my Uncle Greg.

85
00:05:41.988 --> 00:05:45.389
A very nice guy, but, you
know, he's a dentist.

86
00:05:46.326 --> 00:05:48.760
Now consider this your
retirement letter.

87
00:05:50.263 --> 00:05:52.595
Boom. It's over.

88
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.131
See your way out.

89
00:05:58.972 --> 00:06:01.338
What, you truly don't
think I'm scary?

90
00:06:04.077 --> 00:06:05.077
No.

91
00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:10.807
Okay, okay, you're scary.

92
00:06:10.984 --> 00:06:12.315
Shit, you're scary.

93
00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:13.509
You just said I'm not.

94
00:06:13.687 --> 00:06:15.120
No, no, you are. You are.

95
00:06:15.288 --> 00:06:16.880
What's a Disco Santa?

96
00:06:17.057 --> 00:06:19.048
A Disco Santa? I don't know.

97
00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:20.225
Sorry.

98
00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:21.758
It was just something stupid.

99
00:06:21.928 --> 00:06:23.156
You said I'm boring.

100
00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:26.298
My gun has two barrels.
That's not boring.

101
00:06:26.466 --> 00:06:28.661
And it was very difficult to make.

102
00:06:30.437 --> 00:06:32.696
- Answer me.
- What?

103
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.167
What could I do to be more scary?

104
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.844
A better name? Cooler name?

105
00:06:38.845 --> 00:06:40.006
More colour or something.

106
00:06:41.881 --> 00:06:44.372
Maybe you could say
something to people

107
00:06:44.551 --> 00:06:46.280
before you kill them. But not now.

108
00:06:46.453 --> 00:06:49.217
It's hard to think with this
double-barrel in my face.

109
00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:50.389
Sorry.

110
00:06:55.595 --> 00:06:58.029
You've given me a
lot to think about.

111
00:07:02.702 --> 00:07:05.068
You're not gonna kill
me? Oh, I get it.

112
00:07:05.238 --> 00:07:08.571
You keep me alive so I
can spread your legend.

113
00:07:08.842 --> 00:07:12.175
Okay, I'll do that, man.
I'll spread your legend.

114
00:07:12.612 --> 00:07:14.204
Hey, you forgot your briefcase.

115
00:07:44.577 --> 00:07:46.511
Let's get this party crazy.

116
00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:30.786
Behold, my lady.

117
00:09:29.849 --> 00:09:31.680
That's the good stuff.

118
00:09:33.152 --> 00:09:34.483
Oh, man.

119
00:09:38.057 --> 00:09:41.959
Good morning...

120
00:09:42.095 --> 00:09:43.095
Ana Lee.

121
00:09:43.129 --> 00:09:44.687
Ana Lee. That's what I meant.

122
00:09:46.499 --> 00:09:47.864
Oh, shit.

123
00:09:51.137 --> 00:09:54.231
Son. This what you
want from your life?

124
00:09:57.176 --> 00:09:58.336
This...

125
00:09:59.479 --> 00:10:01.504
This gives you a
sense of fulfilment?

126
00:10:02.548 --> 00:10:04.778
Dad, I told you,
tomorrow I'm enrolling

127
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:07.010
in ITT Technical Institute

128
00:10:07.186 --> 00:10:09.450
and I'm gonna fix computers
for a living, so...

129
00:10:09.622 --> 00:10:10.622
Ow.

130
00:10:11.257 --> 00:10:13.919
I spend all night
writing an editorial

131
00:10:14.093 --> 00:10:16.687
about the nausea this
town has come to inspire.

132
00:10:16.863 --> 00:10:20.060
About the corruption, the
violence and the decadence

133
00:10:20.233 --> 00:10:22.963
that we've come to expect
as part of our daily life.

134
00:10:23.603 --> 00:10:26.163
Then I have to turn the page

135
00:10:27.173 --> 00:10:31.236
and see my own son's
contribution to this mayhem.

136
00:10:33.646 --> 00:10:36.080
Sweet. I'm in the paper?

137
00:10:36.249 --> 00:10:38.941
Now, you may think
you're humiliating me,

138
00:10:39.118 --> 00:10:41.086
but you're humiliating yourself.

139
00:10:41.254 --> 00:10:44.087
Sorry. If you don't like it,
just ask them not to print it.

140
00:10:44.257 --> 00:10:45.257
It's your newspaper.

141
00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:47.723
I can't, because,
unfortunately, it's news.

142
00:10:47.894 --> 00:10:49.156
That's a good point.

143
00:10:49.329 --> 00:10:51.229
I kept myself out of
the papers for years.

144
00:10:51.397 --> 00:10:53.262
Now do me a favour
and do the same.

145
00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:57.694
And I told you, stop taking
girls into my garage.

146
00:10:59.205 --> 00:11:01.298
You do it again, I'll
change the lock.

147
00:11:03.576 --> 00:11:06.101
Okay, but can you
sign this for me?

148
00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:07.303
Yeah.

149
00:11:09.282 --> 00:11:13.343
Never stop the party.

150
00:11:36.476 --> 00:11:37.841
Look at these.

151
00:11:39.645 --> 00:11:41.636
My shoe.

152
00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:43.439
Hello? Hello? Hello?

153
00:11:43.616 --> 00:11:45.675
I'm very uncomfortable.

154
00:11:47.286 --> 00:11:48.878
Who is it?

155
00:11:49.088 --> 00:11:51.716
Whoa. Paparazzi in the house.

156
00:11:51.891 --> 00:11:53.483
Change the channel.

157
00:11:53.659 --> 00:11:56.184
I think we may have our
first visual on Britt Reid.

158
00:11:56.362 --> 00:11:59.058
Go, go, go. Go. Get in
there. It's for me. Hello?

159
00:11:59.265 --> 00:12:00.323
Get in there.

160
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.263
Get in there. Get
the shot. Get it.

161
00:12:02.435 --> 00:12:04.801
And how are you coping
with your father's death?

162
00:12:04.971 --> 00:12:06.291
Give us some insight.

163
00:12:07.173 --> 00:12:08.697
If you're just joining us,

164
00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:11.241
James Reid has been
found dead from

165
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:13.003
an allergic reaction
to a bee sting,

166
00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:15.044
leaving his son his media empire.

167
00:12:15.348 --> 00:12:17.578
How are you coping with
your father's death?

168
00:12:42.408 --> 00:12:44.239
It was during my election campaign

169
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.106
for district attorney that
I first met James Reid.

170
00:12:47.313 --> 00:12:50.476
And it was immediately clear
to me that he was a man of

171
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.413
infallible integrity.

172
00:12:53.052 --> 00:12:54.601
He dedicated himself to this city

173
00:12:54.602 --> 00:12:56.385
through his philanthropic
endeavours

174
00:12:56.556 --> 00:12:58.786
and his newspaper,
The Daily Sentinel,

175
00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.687
a shining beacon of truth.

176
00:13:02.395 --> 00:13:03.726
He was our North Star.

177
00:13:04.063 --> 00:13:05.587
He showed us the way.

178
00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:08.833
Thank you, James.

179
00:13:22.348 --> 00:13:24.907
Britt, your father was
truly a great man.

180
00:13:24.984 --> 00:13:28.011
When I started campaigning,
he gave me some...

181
00:13:28.087 --> 00:13:29.987
The best businessman
I've ever known.

182
00:13:30.156 --> 00:13:32.420
- He always came out on top.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:13:32.592 --> 00:13:33.718
Britt?

184
00:13:35.995 --> 00:13:36.995
Britt.

185
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.097
Hey. I'm so sorry for your loss.

186
00:13:40.433 --> 00:13:42.628
I just wanted to
say that my father

187
00:13:42.802 --> 00:13:45.930
was a federal court judge, so
I think I know how it feels.

188
00:13:46.606 --> 00:13:50.303
When he passed away, I had
some pretty big shoes to fill.

189
00:13:50.476 --> 00:13:51.807
Just like you.

190
00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:55.245
So if you ever need
somebody to talk to...

191
00:13:55.414 --> 00:13:57.743
I mean, if you ever
just want to grab

192
00:13:57.744 --> 00:14:00.010
a drink, you want
to get cheered up,

193
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.980
I'm around.

194
00:14:02.889 --> 00:14:04.948
Okay, thanks, man. I
really appreciate...

195
00:14:05.124 --> 00:14:06.614
- Lock it up.
- Yeah. Okay.

196
00:14:06.792 --> 00:14:08.692
Keep it tight. Cool.

197
00:14:20.506 --> 00:14:22.201
This is your newspaper,

198
00:14:24.443 --> 00:14:27.310
but the burden doesn't
have to fall on you alone.

199
00:14:33.452 --> 00:14:35.708
I've been your
father's most trusted

200
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.722
colleague for the past 45 years.

201
00:14:38.991 --> 00:14:40.856
I'm gonna make sure
The Daily Sentinel

202
00:14:41.027 --> 00:14:43.359
stays on a path that
would make him proud.

203
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.629
So, what do you think of all this?

204
00:14:53.973 --> 00:14:55.838
I don't think anything, man.

205
00:14:56.943 --> 00:14:59.639
I don't know a thing
about this newspaper.

206
00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:02.746
I've never even read a
full edition of it.

207
00:15:03.349 --> 00:15:05.510
You can do whatever the
hell you want with it.

208
00:15:05.851 --> 00:15:08.012
I'm not the guy to
run The Sentinel.

209
00:15:19.565 --> 00:15:22.830
Trying doesn't matter
when you always fail.

210
00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.010
Huh.

211
00:15:33.012 --> 00:15:34.343
Where's my leaf?

212
00:15:44.357 --> 00:15:45.756
Stupid bush.

213
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.090
Hello.

214
00:15:52.265 --> 00:15:53.892
Who makes my coffee?

215
00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:55.590
Who makes my coffee?

216
00:15:55.768 --> 00:15:58.931
Will someone explain to me why,
on the worst day of my life,

217
00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:01.798
my coffee tastes like shit?

218
00:16:02.141 --> 00:16:04.132
Your coffee is
normally made by Kato.

219
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.073
Who the hell is that?

220
00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:09.248
He works on your father's
cars and makes his coffee.

221
00:16:09.415 --> 00:16:12.407
You fired him and everyone who
works for your father yesterday.

222
00:16:12.585 --> 00:16:14.280
I want Kato here now.

223
00:16:29.802 --> 00:16:31.235
You're Kato?

224
00:16:32.138 --> 00:16:35.073
I thought your name was Henry. I
thought the pool guy was Kato.

225
00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:36.572
I'm Kato.

226
00:16:38.411 --> 00:16:40.641
I'm sorry to hear
about your father.

227
00:16:40.813 --> 00:16:43.611
He was a complex man.

228
00:16:46.352 --> 00:16:47.580
Yeah.

229
00:16:48.454 --> 00:16:51.821
I have two questions for you,
Kato. Then you can go home.

230
00:16:51.991 --> 00:16:54.459
Why is it that my dad's
mechanic makes the coffee?

231
00:16:54.627 --> 00:16:58.263
And why is it that without you,
the coffee tastes like crap?

232
00:16:58.264 --> 00:17:00.061
I think it's easier if I show you.

233
00:17:02.668 --> 00:17:04.226
Holy cow.

234
00:17:04.403 --> 00:17:05.734
Where did you get that thing?

235
00:17:05.905 --> 00:17:06.905
I made it.

236
00:17:07.006 --> 00:17:08.006
Watch this.

237
00:17:08.007 --> 00:17:09.065
You made that?

238
00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.617
Sit with me, Kato.
Tell me your tale.

239
00:17:54.787 --> 00:17:57.415
I was born in Shanghai.
You know Shanghai?

240
00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:58.882
Love Japan.

241
00:17:59.058 --> 00:18:01.390
My parents died when I was 4,

242
00:18:01.861 --> 00:18:05.627
and until I was 12 I
lived in an orphanage.

243
00:18:06.766 --> 00:18:09.257
I'm sorry. My mum died
when I was young too.

244
00:18:09.435 --> 00:18:12.461
What happened after that?

245
00:18:12.638 --> 00:18:15.004
Then me and a few
friends ran away.

246
00:18:15.408 --> 00:18:17.273
- Lived on the street.
- How'd you start

247
00:18:17.443 --> 00:18:19.843
- working for my dad?
- I work in a garage.

248
00:18:20.012 --> 00:18:23.311
And one day your father came
in with a '65 Chrysler.

249
00:18:23.516 --> 00:18:24.881
I know the car well.

250
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.077
He was so happy with my work
that he offered me a job.

251
00:18:29.255 --> 00:18:30.654
I said yes.

252
00:18:30.823 --> 00:18:32.916
The coffee. How'd that come about?

253
00:18:33.092 --> 00:18:34.650
He used to always say:

254
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.790
No one could ever make
me a good cup of coffee.

255
00:18:37.963 --> 00:18:38.987
Good impression.

256
00:18:39.165 --> 00:18:41.258
So I built him the coffee machine.

257
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:45.161
Well, you make one damn
fine cup of coffee, sir.

258
00:18:45.538 --> 00:18:47.301
Wanna see something cool?

259
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.240
Yeah.

260
00:18:53.312 --> 00:18:55.246
Not bad, man.

261
00:18:55.414 --> 00:18:56.676
- You did that?
- Yep.

262
00:18:56.849 --> 00:18:58.908
Industrial polycarbonate.

263
00:18:59.785 --> 00:19:02.253
What the hell is
industrial polycarbonate?

264
00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:06.985
It's the stuff they use
to make shark tanks.

265
00:19:07.159 --> 00:19:08.285
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

266
00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:10.691
What are you doing? Put
that away. Are you crazy?

267
00:19:10.863 --> 00:19:11.863
Come on.

268
00:19:12.064 --> 00:19:13.463
Don't be a pussy.

269
00:19:14.366 --> 00:19:15.697
Okay.

270
00:19:16.869 --> 00:19:18.359
What are you gonna do?

271
00:19:21.707 --> 00:19:22.707
Whoa.

272
00:19:22.708 --> 00:19:23.936
Dude.

273
00:19:24.477 --> 00:19:27.105
That was awesome. What is that
stuff? How does that work?

274
00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:28.871
Whoa, what are you gonna do now?

275
00:19:29.081 --> 00:19:30.081
And...

276
00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:32.712
Whoa.

277
00:19:33.219 --> 00:19:35.420
That is some Ben-Hur shit, dude.

278
00:19:35.421 --> 00:19:36.421
Yeah.

279
00:19:36.455 --> 00:19:39.288
Your dad made me do this kind of
stuff over the last few years.

280
00:19:42.461 --> 00:19:44.326
That is the balls.

281
00:19:47.867 --> 00:19:50.233
Old man was getting paranoid, huh?

282
00:19:50.402 --> 00:19:51.402
You like that?

283
00:19:51.403 --> 00:19:53.203
Yeah. Check this out.

284
00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:58.032
Wow.

285
00:20:01.413 --> 00:20:03.108
You drew all these?

286
00:20:03.516 --> 00:20:05.245
This is awesome.

287
00:20:05.818 --> 00:20:08.078
Kato, you are a
really good drawer.

288
00:20:08.254 --> 00:20:09.448
This is really impressive.

289
00:20:09.622 --> 00:20:12.056
Thanks. That's the stuff I
would really like to do.

290
00:20:12.224 --> 00:20:13.384
Holy...

291
00:20:13.659 --> 00:20:15.320
Kato, are you a pervert?

292
00:20:16.395 --> 00:20:18.124
I wish I could draw
stuff that sexy.

293
00:20:22.001 --> 00:20:23.001
Beer?

294
00:20:23.002 --> 00:20:25.061
Yeah, I'd love a beer. Sure.

295
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:38.878
Thank you.

296
00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:48.359
Hey, Kato?

297
00:20:49.728 --> 00:20:51.593
What did you think of my father?

298
00:20:51.797 --> 00:20:52.889
He was fine.

299
00:20:54.233 --> 00:20:56.098
Come on. Just tell me.

300
00:20:56.268 --> 00:20:59.533
He was my boss. Nobody
loves their boss.

301
00:21:00.039 --> 00:21:02.439
Don't sugarcoat this. You're
not going to offend me.

302
00:21:02.608 --> 00:21:04.235
Just tell me, man to man.

303
00:21:05.978 --> 00:21:07.912
He was a bit of a dick.

304
00:21:10.616 --> 00:21:11.810
Yep.

305
00:21:13.385 --> 00:21:14.477
What?

306
00:21:15.287 --> 00:21:16.618
You are...

307
00:21:17.389 --> 00:21:18.822
Look at that.

308
00:21:19.491 --> 00:21:20.924
I am genius.

309
00:21:21.093 --> 00:21:22.583
You are a genius. Yeah.

310
00:21:22.761 --> 00:21:24.092
You're a mad genius.

311
00:21:24.263 --> 00:21:25.560
I like classical music.

312
00:21:26.432 --> 00:21:28.157
You're a genius who
likes classical

313
00:21:28.158 --> 00:21:29.595
music. You know what you are?

314
00:21:29.768 --> 00:21:30.996
A human Swiss Army knife.

315
00:21:31.303 --> 00:21:32.531
What's that mean?

316
00:21:32.705 --> 00:21:35.037
It's a little thing, you
keep pulling out things.

317
00:21:35.207 --> 00:21:37.471
When you think there
couldn't be any more,

318
00:21:37.643 --> 00:21:39.577
a new cool thing comes
out. That's you.

319
00:21:39.745 --> 00:21:40.973
You even dress like one.

320
00:21:41.146 --> 00:21:42.943
Just need a little
plus on your chest.

321
00:21:43.115 --> 00:21:45.140
- Let's drink more.
- Yeah, let's drink.

322
00:21:47.453 --> 00:21:48.545
Yeah.

323
00:21:49.989 --> 00:21:51.354
You're speaking Chinese.

324
00:21:51.523 --> 00:21:53.457
Oh, shit. Sorry.

325
00:21:53.626 --> 00:21:57.619
I spent three weeks making a new
bumper for his Rolls-Royce.

326
00:21:57.796 --> 00:22:00.959
And the day after I
finished, he crashed it.

327
00:22:01.934 --> 00:22:05.734
He actually said it was my
fault. He screamed at me.

328
00:22:06.305 --> 00:22:07.863
That sounds like him.

329
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.498
Listen to this, here's another
story of the 10 million I have.

330
00:22:11.977 --> 00:22:14.207
I'm young, there's a...

331
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.178
Guys are picking on a girl
in school, I try to stop it.

332
00:22:17.349 --> 00:22:18.441
I get in trouble.

333
00:22:18.617 --> 00:22:19.675
What does my dad do?

334
00:22:19.852 --> 00:22:21.900
He takes my favourite
toy, and he rips

335
00:22:21.901 --> 00:22:23.948
the head off it. Right
in front of me.

336
00:22:24.123 --> 00:22:25.488
He throws it in the garbage.

337
00:22:25.658 --> 00:22:28.456
I was trying to help. That's
all I was trying to do.

338
00:22:29.194 --> 00:22:30.957
You know, it's unbelievable.

339
00:22:31.897 --> 00:22:34.118
He's an ass his
entire life and then,

340
00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:36.163
you know, they build him a statue.

341
00:22:36.335 --> 00:22:37.700
I just don't think...

342
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:42.136
People are gonna look at it and
think he's great but he's not.

343
00:22:42.307 --> 00:22:43.968
It's totally unfair.

344
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.400
There's no justice.

345
00:22:50.349 --> 00:22:51.577
Well, Kato?

346
00:22:52.651 --> 00:22:55.882
What do you say we get ourselves
some goddamn justice, huh?

347
00:22:56.355 --> 00:22:57.355
You serious?

348
00:22:57.523 --> 00:22:58.547
I'm totally serious.

349
00:22:58.724 --> 00:23:01.318
Let's do something crazy,
man. Let's do something nuts.

350
00:23:01.794 --> 00:23:03.022
Let's just do it.

351
00:23:03.195 --> 00:23:04.195
Yeah.

352
00:23:13.372 --> 00:23:14.566
Let's roll, Kato.

353
00:23:28.821 --> 00:23:31.449
Do you think it makes me
happy to do this, Dad?

354
00:23:44.737 --> 00:23:46.034
Come here.

355
00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.598
Whoop.

356
00:23:50.342 --> 00:23:51.707
I know what you mean.

357
00:23:56.215 --> 00:23:57.648
Oh, this looks ominous.

358
00:23:59.785 --> 00:24:01.275
Where you going, man?

359
00:24:11.764 --> 00:24:14.062
Oh, shit. Oh, no.

360
00:24:19.171 --> 00:24:21.071
What do I do? What do I do?

361
00:24:21.573 --> 00:24:22.801
Oh, God.

362
00:24:24.409 --> 00:24:26.104
Hey. Leave them alone.

363
00:24:26.979 --> 00:24:28.139
Let's get him.

364
00:24:28.313 --> 00:24:29.313
Oh, shit.

365
00:24:29.348 --> 00:24:30.576
I made a mistake.

366
00:24:35.988 --> 00:24:37.148
Shit.

367
00:24:39.091 --> 00:24:41.116
Guys, seriously. That's messed up.

368
00:24:41.293 --> 00:24:42.293
Seriously.

369
00:24:47.599 --> 00:24:48.623
No.

370
00:24:48.801 --> 00:24:50.701
Okay. Okay. No.

371
00:24:50.903 --> 00:24:52.461
I'm gonna give him a root canal.

372
00:24:52.638 --> 00:24:53.638
Just cut him.

373
00:24:53.639 --> 00:24:55.630
Get off, man. That's enough.

374
00:24:56.608 --> 00:24:57.632
Open wi...

375
00:25:00.646 --> 00:25:02.546
- You're a dead man.
- Come on, let's go.

376
00:25:43.255 --> 00:25:44.984
Britt. Behind you.

377
00:25:52.164 --> 00:25:53.461
Eat shit.

378
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:58.736
Kato, wait up.

379
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.939
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

380
00:26:03.108 --> 00:26:05.576
Wait. Wait for me. Wait. Wait.

381
00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:09.977
Go, go, go. I'm in.
I'm in. I'm in.

382
00:26:11.583 --> 00:26:14.882
Oh, God. That was crazy.
I can't believe that.

383
00:26:15.053 --> 00:26:17.920
Holy shit. Oh, my God, Kato.

384
00:26:26.064 --> 00:26:27.395
Shit. Pigs.

385
00:26:27.566 --> 00:26:29.193
Oh, no. Oh, no.

386
00:26:29.368 --> 00:26:30.858
Are you a good driver?

387
00:26:31.203 --> 00:26:32.227
You kidding me?

388
00:26:32.404 --> 00:26:34.463
When I was a kid, me
and some friends...

389
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.971
Kato, not now. Just drive.

390
00:26:36.141 --> 00:26:37.165
Okay, okay.

391
00:26:42.281 --> 00:26:43.441
Just act cool.

392
00:26:43.615 --> 00:26:45.810
What do I do? Just act casual.

393
00:26:46.018 --> 00:26:47.018
Pull it over. Now.

394
00:26:48.587 --> 00:26:49.587
What are you doing?

395
00:26:49.721 --> 00:26:50.881
I'm trying to lose him.

396
00:26:51.056 --> 00:26:52.056
I don't know.

397
00:26:52.057 --> 00:26:53.757
Man, now we're in a car chase.

398
00:26:54.793 --> 00:26:56.021
Here he comes.

399
00:27:00.132 --> 00:27:01.190
Show me your hands.

400
00:27:09.107 --> 00:27:10.233
He's trying to kill us.

401
00:27:10.609 --> 00:27:11.803
Do the Ben-Hur shit.

402
00:27:13.545 --> 00:27:14.545
The Ben-Hur shit.

403
00:27:26.258 --> 00:27:27.258
Oh, no.

404
00:27:35.267 --> 00:27:36.996
Aw. Damn it.

405
00:27:39.071 --> 00:27:40.071
Kato...

406
00:27:41.173 --> 00:27:44.108
I think this is the greatest
moment of my entire life.

407
00:27:44.276 --> 00:27:46.141
I know. Mine too.

408
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.612
Yeah. We rule.

409
00:27:56.455 --> 00:27:58.082
That was amazing.

410
00:28:05.998 --> 00:28:07.829
We are awesome.

411
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
That was crazy.

412
00:28:09.167 --> 00:28:12.102
How do you do that, dude? You
beat the crap out of those guys.

413
00:28:12.371 --> 00:28:14.737
Where I grew up, it
was very dangerous.

414
00:28:14.906 --> 00:28:17.670
I got in a lot of fights
when I was a kid.

415
00:28:17.843 --> 00:28:20.141
But you knew where people
were without looking.

416
00:28:20.312 --> 00:28:21.370
You were so fast.

417
00:28:21.546 --> 00:28:25.744
When my heart starts pumping,
it's almost like time slows down.

418
00:28:25.917 --> 00:28:27.976
It's unbelievable how cool we are.

419
00:28:28.153 --> 00:28:30.485
Do you hear me, Dad? We did it.

420
00:28:30.655 --> 00:28:32.088
That was amazing.

421
00:28:32.257 --> 00:28:33.656
Kato, I'm serious.

422
00:28:35.761 --> 00:28:38.924
I'm gonna get real with
you, so just go with this.

423
00:28:39.131 --> 00:28:43.166
It might get weird and intimate,
but just accept me, okay?

424
00:28:43.335 --> 00:28:47.829
What we did tonight was
fantastic. It was amazing.

425
00:28:48.006 --> 00:28:51.737
We saved those people,
man. We saved their lives.

426
00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:54.879
So here's what I'm saying.
We keep doing this.

427
00:28:55.047 --> 00:28:57.174
You can beat the crap
out of a million dudes

428
00:28:57.349 --> 00:29:00.045
because you freeze time when
your heart starts pumping.

429
00:29:00.218 --> 00:29:02.379
We do that every
night, I'm saying.

430
00:29:02.554 --> 00:29:04.181
Kato? Kato?

431
00:29:06.358 --> 00:29:10.055
♪ We could be heroes ♪

432
00:29:10.128 --> 00:29:11.128
Hey, hey, hey.

433
00:29:11.196 --> 00:29:12.196
Look, look.

434
00:29:12.264 --> 00:29:14.528
Oh. We're on television.

435
00:29:15.534 --> 00:29:16.865
We're on TV.

436
00:29:19.037 --> 00:29:20.095
Look at me.

437
00:29:20.272 --> 00:29:21.466
Where am I?

438
00:29:21.673 --> 00:29:22.901
I don't know.

439
00:29:24.576 --> 00:29:26.134
I'm too fast for TV.

440
00:29:26.311 --> 00:29:27.778
Yes, exactly.

441
00:29:27.946 --> 00:29:30.437
Desecrated. And
this within days...

442
00:29:30.615 --> 00:29:33.641
We saved those people and they
just talk about that stupid head.

443
00:29:33.819 --> 00:29:36.947
How can we be heroes if
they think we're criminals?

444
00:29:37.122 --> 00:29:39.784
The suspects are considered
armed and dangerous.

445
00:29:39.958 --> 00:29:42.927
I am coming to you live from
Elysian Fields Cemetery...

446
00:29:44.296 --> 00:29:45.296
Okay.

447
00:29:46.231 --> 00:29:47.789
Think about this, Kato.

448
00:29:48.266 --> 00:29:50.910
What is the one
insanely stupid thing

449
00:29:50.911 --> 00:29:53.067
every superhero has in common?

450
00:29:54.239 --> 00:29:55.239
Tights?

451
00:29:55.574 --> 00:29:56.574
No.

452
00:29:56.608 --> 00:29:57.608
Cape?

453
00:29:57.742 --> 00:29:58.800
No, Kato.

454
00:29:58.977 --> 00:30:01.583
It's that everyone
knows that they're

455
00:30:01.584 --> 00:30:03.914
the good guy, the hero, you know?

456
00:30:04.082 --> 00:30:06.983
All the bad guy has to do is
start capping innocent people

457
00:30:07.152 --> 00:30:09.643
and he's got the good
guy by the nuts.

458
00:30:09.821 --> 00:30:11.914
It's in every movie, it's
in every comic book.

459
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.149
It's in everything.
It's so stupid.

460
00:30:14.326 --> 00:30:17.996
But if the bad guy thought
the good guy was also a bad

461
00:30:17.997 --> 00:30:20.020
guy, he wouldn't be
able to do that.

462
00:30:20.198 --> 00:30:23.927
That's what we'll do differently.
We will pose as villains,

463
00:30:24.102 --> 00:30:25.763
but we'll act like heroes.

464
00:30:26.338 --> 00:30:30.138
But then the police and the bad
guys will both try to kill us.

465
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:32.443
We're dead already, Kato.

466
00:30:32.878 --> 00:30:35.369
I mean, seriously, look at us.

467
00:30:35.547 --> 00:30:38.243
We've both been completely
wasting our potential.

468
00:30:38.517 --> 00:30:40.178
You a little bit more than me.

469
00:30:40.352 --> 00:30:42.843
What do you want your
autobiography to be called?

470
00:30:43.121 --> 00:30:45.954
Oil Changes and Cappuccinos?

471
00:30:46.124 --> 00:30:51.357
Because I think Balls Deep in
Shit-Kicking Dudes by Kato

472
00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.623
is a much cooler-sounding book.

473
00:30:53.798 --> 00:30:56.232
I would read that book,
and I don't read shit.

474
00:30:56.401 --> 00:30:58.319
But when they adapted
it into a movie,

475
00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.893
I would see the shit out of it.

476
00:31:00.071 --> 00:31:02.699
Kato, you should never make
coffee for anyone again.

477
00:31:02.874 --> 00:31:04.205
It's a waste of your talent.

478
00:31:04.376 --> 00:31:06.844
It's not dying that you
need to be afraid of.

479
00:31:07.012 --> 00:31:09.708
It's never having lived
in the first place.

480
00:31:13.785 --> 00:31:16.185
It did feel good
saving those people.

481
00:31:16.354 --> 00:31:18.549
Well, technically, I saved
them, but you helped.

482
00:31:18.723 --> 00:31:19.957
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

483
00:31:19.958 --> 00:31:22.126
Let's not get technical.
But why would people

484
00:31:22.194 --> 00:31:25.061
take us serious? We're just
two guys who stole a head.

485
00:31:31.803 --> 00:31:33.896
I know how to make them
take us seriously.

486
00:31:41.746 --> 00:31:44.715
All right, gentlemen. Hear ye,
hear ye. Court is in session.

487
00:31:44.883 --> 00:31:46.908
Let's talk shop, okay?

488
00:31:47.085 --> 00:31:48.177
Shall we?

489
00:31:49.454 --> 00:31:51.081
Who's this guy?

490
00:31:51.556 --> 00:31:52.887
Who's your friend?

491
00:31:53.058 --> 00:31:55.185
He's my man. I'm not your man.

492
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.625
He's not my man. No.
He's not my man.

493
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.424
He's like, you know, he's
like my man. He's my...

494
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.595
Not... We're Plato...
it's Plato...

495
00:32:03.768 --> 00:32:05.895
We're platonic friends.
Platonic male friends.

496
00:32:06.371 --> 00:32:09.397
He's my executive associate.

497
00:32:10.141 --> 00:32:13.110
Yes. That's who he is,
and that doesn't matter.

498
00:32:13.278 --> 00:32:17.414
What does matter is how we
tackle this horrible incident.

499
00:32:17.582 --> 00:32:21.074
Whoever did this means business,
and this is just the beginning.

500
00:32:21.253 --> 00:32:24.450
What are you talking about? You
mean the vandalising business?

501
00:32:24.623 --> 00:32:25.885
Ah, I get it.

502
00:32:26.057 --> 00:32:28.890
Listen, let's not blow this
thing out of proportion.

503
00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.426
I will blow this guy in
any proportion I like.

504
00:32:31.596 --> 00:32:32.596
This is my

505
00:32:32.631 --> 00:32:35.998
newspaper, Axford, and I want
this man on the front page of it.

506
00:32:36.167 --> 00:32:39.659
I want him on the webpage. I
want you to blog about him.

507
00:32:39.871 --> 00:32:42.135
I want him on every
news outlet we have.

508
00:32:42.307 --> 00:32:45.671
I want the whole city to know
how dangerous this man is.

509
00:32:45.877 --> 00:32:47.572
The man that cut the head off

510
00:32:47.746 --> 00:32:50.442
of my father's statue. Not yours.

511
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:52.910
All right.

512
00:32:53.418 --> 00:32:56.876
Since there isn't any real
info on the guy's identity,

513
00:32:57.055 --> 00:32:59.819
what do we call him?

514
00:33:10.969 --> 00:33:12.266
That's easy.

515
00:33:12.604 --> 00:33:13.901
I got it.

516
00:33:14.706 --> 00:33:17.698
This man is called

517
00:33:18.009 --> 00:33:20.170
the Green Bee.

518
00:33:25.784 --> 00:33:26.784
It's kind of lame.

519
00:33:26.951 --> 00:33:28.475
It sounds like a knitting store.

520
00:33:28.653 --> 00:33:30.416
It sounds like an energy bar.

521
00:33:30.622 --> 00:33:32.284
No, that came out
wrong. That's not

522
00:33:32.285 --> 00:33:33.853
what I meant. I didn't mean that.

523
00:33:34.025 --> 00:33:35.822
I like the Decapitator.

524
00:33:35.994 --> 00:33:38.622
Well, then make it like
the Green Desecrater.

525
00:33:38.797 --> 00:33:40.458
What's the guy that
drives the horse?

526
00:33:40.632 --> 00:33:41.872
Or Green Trenchcoat Guy.

527
00:33:41.966 --> 00:33:43.160
The Green Hornet.

528
00:33:43.335 --> 00:33:44.563
No. It's more like...

529
00:33:44.736 --> 00:33:46.067
- What?
- What did?

530
00:33:46.237 --> 00:33:47.727
The Green Hornet.

531
00:33:49.641 --> 00:33:50.733
That's pretty awesome.

532
00:33:50.909 --> 00:33:51.909
Much better.

533
00:33:52.077 --> 00:33:54.341
- You guys like that?
- Yeah, your man's right.

534
00:33:54.512 --> 00:33:56.207
- Green Hornet it is.
- Looks good too.

535
00:33:56.381 --> 00:33:59.316
The Green Hornet. Yeah.
Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine.

536
00:33:59.484 --> 00:34:01.008
It's decided, then.

537
00:34:01.186 --> 00:34:03.051
The front page of
tomorrow's newspaper

538
00:34:03.221 --> 00:34:06.588
will feature the Green Hornet.
Unless you like Green Bee better?

539
00:34:06.758 --> 00:34:07.758
Anyone? No one?

540
00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:08.851
Oh, that's much worse.

541
00:34:09.027 --> 00:34:10.551
Definitely Hornet. Okay, fine.

542
00:34:11.029 --> 00:34:12.496
Let's roll, Kato.

543
00:34:13.331 --> 00:34:15.094
So Green Hornet des...

544
00:34:15.266 --> 00:34:17.226
Oh, no, not desecrates.
How about decapitates?

545
00:34:17.302 --> 00:34:18.769
It's gonna be a long night.

546
00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:36.409
I am.

547
00:34:40.091 --> 00:34:42.059
We need to think of a
cool name for you.

548
00:34:42.227 --> 00:34:43.251
The Lil' Stinger.

549
00:34:43.428 --> 00:34:45.328
I'm the Green Hornet,
you're Lil' Stinger.

550
00:34:45.497 --> 00:34:46.521
No way.

551
00:34:47.532 --> 00:34:48.794
The Honey Pot.

552
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.569
Get it? Like, bees make
honey? You're my Honey Pot.

553
00:34:53.037 --> 00:34:54.629
What's going on?

554
00:34:58.443 --> 00:35:02.379
Decapitated statues. I
decapitated real people.

555
00:35:02.547 --> 00:35:04.447
No, no. I wouldn't worry about it.

556
00:35:04.616 --> 00:35:06.880
He won't affect business.

557
00:35:08.119 --> 00:35:09.586
I'm not worried.

558
00:35:10.522 --> 00:35:12.319
Who told you I'm worried?

559
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.590
DA Scanlon.

560
00:35:13.758 --> 00:35:16.784
With the nightclub bombing, and
now this Green Hornet guy,

561
00:35:16.961 --> 00:35:19.657
some say the streets might
not be as safe as you say.

562
00:35:19.831 --> 00:35:21.059
Look, guys,

563
00:35:21.232 --> 00:35:23.666
stop connecting separate
thoughts with invisible lines.

564
00:35:23.835 --> 00:35:26.395
This Green Hornet thing
is just a prank.

565
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:29.369
What you guys should report
is that since I took office

566
00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:32.635
crime is down significantly
in the city of Los Angeles.

567
00:35:32.811 --> 00:35:33.971
Thank you.

568
00:36:02.807 --> 00:36:04.274
Hi. Hi.

569
00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:05.939
I'm Lenore Case.

570
00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:09.273
I'm the temp for Mr Reid's
secretarial position.

571
00:36:09.447 --> 00:36:10.812
Today's my first day.

572
00:36:11.182 --> 00:36:14.618
Oh, nice to meet you. I'm Kato.

573
00:36:14.786 --> 00:36:16.117
It's my first day too.

574
00:36:16.287 --> 00:36:18.448
Really? Well, nice to meet you.

575
00:36:18.623 --> 00:36:19.988
Do you work for Mr Reid?

576
00:36:20.358 --> 00:36:22.383
I'm his executive associate.

577
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.357
Wow. That must be great.

578
00:36:24.796 --> 00:36:27.196
Yeah, it is. So far.

579
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.331
I have a really
important question.

580
00:36:30.502 --> 00:36:32.402
Who is the hottie-boom-bottie

581
00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.538
who's standing right
behind me right now?

582
00:36:34.706 --> 00:36:37.504
I'm kidding. Hi, I'm Britt
Reid. I own this newspaper.

583
00:36:37.675 --> 00:36:40.508
What's going on? It's such a
pleasure. I'm Lenore Case.

584
00:36:40.678 --> 00:36:43.545
I've been sent to be your temp
until you find a new secretary.

585
00:36:44.849 --> 00:36:45.849
Ah.

586
00:36:46.618 --> 00:36:47.618
Jackpot.

587
00:36:47.819 --> 00:36:49.047
Right this way.

588
00:36:49.254 --> 00:36:50.482
So...

589
00:36:51.556 --> 00:36:52.556
got one.

590
00:36:52.557 --> 00:36:53.717
Why don't you tell me:

591
00:36:53.892 --> 00:36:57.555
How do you feel about
the state of this

592
00:36:57.729 --> 00:37:01.188
newspaper as it stands today.

593
00:37:01.566 --> 00:37:02.566
Go.

594
00:37:03.034 --> 00:37:05.400
To be honest, this
paper has taken a dip

595
00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:07.868
in the last few years in
quality and ambition.

596
00:37:08.039 --> 00:37:09.039
Really?

597
00:37:09.173 --> 00:37:12.400
Well, the entire industry has
because of the Internet.

598
00:37:12.577 --> 00:37:15.944
So there's a lot of pressure to
print easy-to-digest articles.

599
00:37:16.114 --> 00:37:17.114
And it's the last

600
00:37:17.215 --> 00:37:20.309
family-owned paper in the city,
one of the only not attached

601
00:37:20.485 --> 00:37:22.919
to a conglomerate, so
it's understandable.

602
00:37:23.087 --> 00:37:24.087
Conglomerate?

603
00:37:24.088 --> 00:37:26.421
The Sentinel used to really
use its independence

604
00:37:26.591 --> 00:37:28.218
to be brazen, at the very least.

605
00:37:28.393 --> 00:37:31.123
Like that article your father
wrote just after the bombing?

606
00:37:31.296 --> 00:37:32.980
That was reporting.
That is the kind

607
00:37:32.981 --> 00:37:34.754
of article that can
make a difference.

608
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.800
Wow.

609
00:37:36.801 --> 00:37:39.133
That was good. You know a
lot about this shit, huh?

610
00:37:39.304 --> 00:37:42.296
I studied journalism. I have
a minor in criminology.

611
00:37:42.473 --> 00:37:43.963
- Really?
- Yeah.

612
00:37:44.175 --> 00:37:46.905
Criminology. The study
of the criminal mind.

613
00:37:47.078 --> 00:37:51.248
What are your thoughts on this
Green Hornet character? Go.

614
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.911
Well, first, there's two
kinds of criminals.

615
00:37:55.086 --> 00:37:57.949
There's the psycho egomaniac
and the power maniac.

616
00:37:58.122 --> 00:37:59.555
He seems to be the second.

617
00:37:59.724 --> 00:38:01.244
- English.
- He defied authority...

618
00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:02.656
What will he do next?

619
00:38:03.394 --> 00:38:04.394
Yeah.

620
00:38:04.562 --> 00:38:07.224
What is his next move,
is what I was gonna ask.

621
00:38:07.732 --> 00:38:08.756
Write this down.

622
00:38:09.434 --> 00:38:12.663
Well, he'll probably try
to appropriate more power.

623
00:38:12.837 --> 00:38:14.964
He'll hit somebody
on their own turf.

624
00:38:15.139 --> 00:38:16.862
Basically, he'll
start out small, and

625
00:38:16.863 --> 00:38:18.631
then he'll work his
way up to the top.

626
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.643
I mean, that's what John Gotti
did to Paul Castellano in '85.

627
00:38:22.013 --> 00:38:23.640
- And it worked?
- Yes.

628
00:38:24.582 --> 00:38:25.981
Wow. Look at you.

629
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.084
You really know a lot
about this stuff.

630
00:38:28.252 --> 00:38:30.083
And you're lovely and
beautiful and...

631
00:38:30.254 --> 00:38:32.251
I'm just sitting
here thinking, Why

632
00:38:32.252 --> 00:38:34.247
are you only pursuing
this in your?

633
00:38:35.727 --> 00:38:37.524
Kato, help me out here.

634
00:38:37.729 --> 00:38:38.855
Twilight?

635
00:38:40.632 --> 00:38:41.632
Twilight?

636
00:38:41.799 --> 00:38:42.799
Twilight?

637
00:38:42.967 --> 00:38:43.967
Yeah.

638
00:38:44.502 --> 00:38:46.868
I saw the movie, but I
don't see how this is...

639
00:38:47.038 --> 00:38:49.871
Oh, no, no, no. Not like that.
No. Not like the movie.

640
00:38:50.041 --> 00:38:54.068
I guess if we're doing movies,
it would be more like Cocoon

641
00:38:54.245 --> 00:38:56.213
or something like that.

642
00:38:56.381 --> 00:38:58.611
Yeah. Later in one's years.

643
00:38:58.783 --> 00:39:00.341
- What are you?
- I'm only 36.

644
00:39:00.518 --> 00:39:01.610
You're 36?

645
00:39:01.786 --> 00:39:03.219
Holy shit. That's crazy.

646
00:39:03.388 --> 00:39:05.117
Thought you were, like, 31, tops.

647
00:39:05.289 --> 00:39:07.416
I don't even know if we
can hire a 36-year-old.

648
00:39:07.592 --> 00:39:08.684
We have to build a ramp.

649
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.127
Huh?

650
00:39:10.128 --> 00:39:11.128
Why now?

651
00:39:11.129 --> 00:39:12.359
She doesn't wanna tell you.

652
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.464
You don't know what
you're talking about.

653
00:39:14.632 --> 00:39:15.690
Mr Kato is right.

654
00:39:15.867 --> 00:39:17.562
I do not feel comfortable.

655
00:39:17.769 --> 00:39:19.699
And if this means I
am not going to be

656
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.728
your temp any longer,
I'm sorry. It's...

657
00:39:21.906 --> 00:39:23.498
That's exactly what it means.

658
00:39:24.876 --> 00:39:26.741
Yeah. Okay, thank you.

659
00:39:26.911 --> 00:39:29.971
Because you are now my
permanent secretary.

660
00:39:30.381 --> 00:39:32.679
Here is what has
gone down, Lenore.

661
00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:35.216
You've displayed two things.

662
00:39:35.386 --> 00:39:36.410
Balls.

663
00:39:36.587 --> 00:39:39.147
And if there's one thing
I like on my women,

664
00:39:39.924 --> 00:39:41.221
it's balls.

665
00:39:41.392 --> 00:39:42.586
Be my permanent secretary.

666
00:39:42.794 --> 00:39:43.794
Are you kidding me?

667
00:39:43.928 --> 00:39:45.589
I'm not kidding. This is how I do.

668
00:39:45.763 --> 00:39:47.697
This is how I roll,
every day, all day.

669
00:39:47.865 --> 00:39:49.924
I make it rain like this, okay?

670
00:39:50.101 --> 00:39:51.329
Come work for me.

671
00:39:51.502 --> 00:39:53.732
Just say yes. Don't think. Really?

672
00:39:53.905 --> 00:39:55.497
I'll do it. Yes. Thank you. Yes.

673
00:39:55.673 --> 00:39:57.402
- This is so exciting.
- It is exciting.

674
00:39:57.575 --> 00:39:59.338
- Thank you so much.
- Don't thank him.

675
00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.670
Thank you. Yes.

676
00:40:00.845 --> 00:40:03.245
- I will not disappoint you.
- I don't think you will.

677
00:40:03.414 --> 00:40:06.508
I will do in-depth research,
fact checking, spell checking.

678
00:40:06.684 --> 00:40:07.776
Anything that you need.

679
00:40:07.952 --> 00:40:11.513
Why don't you get started on more
Green Hornet research? Perfect.

680
00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:13.648
Bam. She is hot.

681
00:40:13.825 --> 00:40:15.465
It's crazy how hot she
is. It's sickening.

682
00:40:15.626 --> 00:40:17.184
Did you write down everything?

683
00:40:17.361 --> 00:40:18.385
Let me see.

684
00:40:19.564 --> 00:40:20.564
Pervert.

685
00:40:21.532 --> 00:40:23.090
Let's get to work, Kato.

686
00:40:24.268 --> 00:40:26.702
All right, we got a
plan. Start small,

687
00:40:26.871 --> 00:40:28.862
- work our way up to the top.
- Okay.

688
00:40:29.907 --> 00:40:30.965
We'll need a car.

689
00:40:31.142 --> 00:40:32.302
Yes, we'll need a car.

690
00:40:32.477 --> 00:40:33.569
With some weapons.

691
00:40:34.479 --> 00:40:35.479
And armour.

692
00:40:35.546 --> 00:40:37.104
Cool rims. Spinning rims.

693
00:40:37.281 --> 00:40:38.305
Slurpee machine.

694
00:40:38.483 --> 00:40:40.041
A horn that plays La Cucaracha.

695
00:40:40.218 --> 00:40:41.947
Loaded up the ass with cool shit.

696
00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.314
I can do that.

697
00:40:43.488 --> 00:40:45.285
Kato, I want you to take my hand

698
00:40:45.456 --> 00:40:47.583
and come with me
on this adventure.

699
00:40:47.759 --> 00:40:50.728
I'll go with you, but I
don't wanna touch you.

700
00:40:50.895 --> 00:40:53.921
Don't take my hand, but will you
come with me on this adventure?

701
00:41:15.987 --> 00:41:16.987
No.

702
00:41:27.532 --> 00:41:29.762
I'll pick this one.

703
00:41:30.802 --> 00:41:32.599
All right. This one.

704
00:41:34.272 --> 00:41:35.762
Tell me what's going down, girl.

705
00:41:40.678 --> 00:41:41.678
Hey, Kato.

706
00:41:41.679 --> 00:41:42.771
Come closer.

707
00:41:42.947 --> 00:41:44.642
I had an idea for the car.

708
00:41:45.016 --> 00:41:46.847
Ejector seats.

709
00:41:47.018 --> 00:41:48.349
Ejector seats?

710
00:41:48.519 --> 00:41:50.316
You don't think it's a good idea?

711
00:41:53.024 --> 00:41:54.355
Hi.

712
00:42:31.696 --> 00:42:33.687
I'm so excited right now.

713
00:42:34.265 --> 00:42:35.755
I can't wait.

714
00:42:40.171 --> 00:42:41.934
Oh, man. What the hell?

715
00:42:42.106 --> 00:42:43.471
Watch your feet.

716
00:42:43.908 --> 00:42:46.342
I call it the Black Beauty.

717
00:42:47.178 --> 00:42:48.338
Kato.

718
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.679
It's beautiful.

719
00:42:52.016 --> 00:42:53.574
And it's black.

720
00:42:53.784 --> 00:42:55.081
Wow.

721
00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.985
Incredible.

722
00:43:05.129 --> 00:43:07.097
Dude, we're forgetting
something important.

723
00:43:09.033 --> 00:43:10.033
Watch this.

724
00:43:14.739 --> 00:43:16.502
That is so wicked.

725
00:43:44.402 --> 00:43:45.402
Whoo.

726
00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.440
Where we going?

727
00:43:50.441 --> 00:43:52.306
I have no idea. I
thought you knew.

728
00:43:52.476 --> 00:43:55.070
Oh, okay, I got an idea. Okay.

729
00:43:58.449 --> 00:43:59.780
Mr Reid's office.

730
00:43:59.951 --> 00:44:01.618
I'm looking at you.

731
00:44:01.619 --> 00:44:02.619
What?

732
00:44:02.653 --> 00:44:03.653
I'm totally joking.

733
00:44:03.821 --> 00:44:05.311
Britt Reid calling.

734
00:44:05.556 --> 00:44:08.150
Burning the candle
at both ends, I see.

735
00:44:08.359 --> 00:44:11.988
Wouldn't Mr Case be
upset with that?

736
00:44:12.563 --> 00:44:14.758
There is no Mr Case?

737
00:44:14.932 --> 00:44:16.695
Well, that's not why I'm calling.

738
00:44:16.867 --> 00:44:20.359
Remember we asked you to do all
that Green Hornet research?

739
00:44:20.571 --> 00:44:22.129
Predicting what he might do next?

740
00:44:22.306 --> 00:44:24.365
If you could send us
that? Those crime maps.

741
00:44:24.575 --> 00:44:26.543
- Oh, yeah.
- That'd be helpful. Fax it over.

742
00:44:26.711 --> 00:44:27.711
Hold on a second.

743
00:44:27.845 --> 00:44:29.642
Let me see. It's
coming right at you.

744
00:44:30.114 --> 00:44:31.114
Great.

745
00:44:31.115 --> 00:44:32.673
So, what you doing? Just?

746
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:34.784
If you need anything
else, let me know.

747
00:44:34.952 --> 00:44:36.512
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Huh. Bye-bye.

748
00:44:38.689 --> 00:44:40.991
She wants me so bad, it's crazy.

749
00:44:40.992 --> 00:44:41.992
Huh.

750
00:44:45.329 --> 00:44:46.329
Here we go.

751
00:44:46.497 --> 00:44:47.497
South Central.

752
00:44:47.598 --> 00:44:50.564
Yeah. Okay. We got 14 homicides,

753
00:44:50.735 --> 00:44:53.670
34 assaults, 116 drug arrests.

754
00:44:53.838 --> 00:44:54.998
This month.

755
00:44:55.339 --> 00:44:57.807
A good place for the Green
Hornet to make his debut.

756
00:44:58.876 --> 00:45:00.366
Let's roll, Kato. Let's roll.

757
00:45:04.648 --> 00:45:06.582
This is really far east.

758
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:08.685
I've never been to
this part of town.

759
00:45:10.821 --> 00:45:12.379
I think we're in the 'hood, Kato.

760
00:45:14.225 --> 00:45:17.351
Britt, Britt. Do you think
we start with them?

761
00:45:17.528 --> 00:45:19.155
Yeah. Just like Lenore said.

762
00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:21.389
Start small, work our way up.

763
00:45:21.565 --> 00:45:23.226
This is really, really intense.

764
00:45:23.401 --> 00:45:25.081
- You don't want to do it?
- I do.

765
00:45:25.101 --> 00:45:27.027
Let's do it before we
chicken out, okay?

766
00:45:27.204 --> 00:45:29.263
- I won't chicken out.
- Who knows who might?

767
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.440
Just pull up to them.

768
00:45:30.641 --> 00:45:31.641
I don't want to talk.

769
00:45:31.776 --> 00:45:33.095
Well, I don't want to talk either.

770
00:45:33.097 --> 00:45:34.337
So get in the back.

771
00:45:34.779 --> 00:45:37.407
- I barely speak English.
- You're speaking English now.

772
00:45:37.581 --> 00:45:40.175
Okay, fine. Oh, this is so stupid.

773
00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:41.351
Okay.

774
00:45:41.719 --> 00:45:43.687
- Calm down.
- I am calm. This is scary.

775
00:45:43.854 --> 00:45:45.947
- Shut up.
- You shut up. Just let me talk.

776
00:45:46.157 --> 00:45:48.117
- Be cool, be cool.
- I am cool. Shut up.

777
00:45:50.227 --> 00:45:52.286
Yo, you looking for
that good stuff, man?

778
00:45:52.287 --> 00:45:53.562
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

779
00:45:53.564 --> 00:45:55.191
I am the Green Hornet.

780
00:45:55.366 --> 00:45:57.425
And I would like to sit
down with your boss.

781
00:45:57.601 --> 00:45:58.601
Sit on this, bitch.

782
00:45:58.769 --> 00:46:00.361
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

783
00:46:02.273 --> 00:46:03.273
Oh, God.

784
00:46:04.275 --> 00:46:05.275
My arm.

785
00:46:15.086 --> 00:46:17.179
Bean bags. Kato, hit
them with the bean bags.

786
00:46:21.425 --> 00:46:23.757
Yeah. Yeah.

787
00:46:23.994 --> 00:46:25.325
Let me show you how it's done.

788
00:46:26.931 --> 00:46:27.931
Green.

789
00:46:27.932 --> 00:46:30.191
Hornet says hello.

790
00:46:53.224 --> 00:46:55.818
Eat my foot, bitch.

791
00:46:57.094 --> 00:46:58.152
My nuts.

792
00:47:06.303 --> 00:47:07.531
What the hell was that?

793
00:47:10.608 --> 00:47:12.269
Who do you work fo?

794
00:47:12.443 --> 00:47:13.808
Oh, God. Gross.

795
00:47:16.447 --> 00:47:17.846
Who do you work for?

796
00:47:18.015 --> 00:47:20.210
Shit. Hey. You.

797
00:47:20.384 --> 00:47:21.715
Come here. Come here.

798
00:47:21.886 --> 00:47:23.148
Hey. Who do you work for?

799
00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.220
Chudnofsky.

800
00:47:24.221 --> 00:47:25.483
Guy everybody works for.

801
00:47:25.656 --> 00:47:27.490
- Chov-what-sky?
- Chudnofsky.

802
00:47:28.392 --> 00:47:30.292
What kind of a dumb name is that?

803
00:47:30.461 --> 00:47:31.861
Where do you get
the shit you sell?

804
00:47:31.881 --> 00:47:33.100
I won't tell you.

805
00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:34.695
Oh, really? Never?

806
00:47:37.434 --> 00:47:39.129
Chudnofsky's on our ass, guys.

807
00:47:39.303 --> 00:47:41.066
We gotta get this shipment done.

808
00:47:48.746 --> 00:47:50.873
You've just been stung.

809
00:47:51.048 --> 00:47:52.276
Yeah.

810
00:47:52.449 --> 00:47:53.449
You.

811
00:47:53.684 --> 00:47:55.549
This is my town now.

812
00:47:55.719 --> 00:47:58.051
My name is the Green Hornet.

813
00:47:58.455 --> 00:48:00.423
Cool, man. Nice to meet you.

814
00:48:00.591 --> 00:48:02.320
Cool. How's it going?

815
00:48:02.826 --> 00:48:07.956
Anyway, tell your boss the Green
Hornet sends his regards.

816
00:48:08.132 --> 00:48:09.132
Dude.

817
00:48:10.834 --> 00:48:13.136
You broke my lab, man.

818
00:48:13.137 --> 00:48:14.170
Yeah.

819
00:48:14.171 --> 00:48:15.798
I'm sorry about that.

820
00:48:19.009 --> 00:48:21.000
Let's burn this mother down, Kato.

821
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:40.660
Explain yourself, Mr Tupper.

822
00:48:41.565 --> 00:48:45.262
The guy was crazy, man. I mean,
he drove a car through a wall.

823
00:48:45.436 --> 00:48:47.404
The thing looked like a half-tank.

824
00:48:47.571 --> 00:48:49.334
There was fire coming
out of the thing.

825
00:48:49.673 --> 00:48:50.799
And?

826
00:48:51.675 --> 00:48:53.040
Oh, yeah, he gave me this.

827
00:48:55.112 --> 00:48:57.273
He said that this is his town now.

828
00:48:59.283 --> 00:49:02.616
A man comes in in an insect
costume and you shit your pants?

829
00:49:02.786 --> 00:49:04.811
Look, trust me.

830
00:49:04.989 --> 00:49:07.514
A grown man wearing a mask

831
00:49:07.691 --> 00:49:10.319
is a little bit scarier
than a guy wearing a suit.

832
00:49:16.834 --> 00:49:18.934
You're not pleased with my suit?

833
00:49:18.935 --> 00:49:21.362
Does it fail to
fill you with fear?

834
00:49:23.374 --> 00:49:26.741
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean any disrespect.

835
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.709
Do you have any
idea how many great

836
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:30.209
people have killed in a suit?

837
00:49:32.716 --> 00:49:33.808
I like your suit.

838
00:49:33.984 --> 00:49:35.008
Me too.

839
00:49:35.319 --> 00:49:37.219
This is exactly what
I was talking about.

840
00:49:37.388 --> 00:49:41.154
I'm not as scary as some idiot
in a green mask. Come on.

841
00:49:42.326 --> 00:49:44.055
You said it won't affect business.

842
00:49:44.228 --> 00:49:47.729
Now, this guy ran six of the
biggest meth labs in L.A.

843
00:49:47.898 --> 00:49:49.729
Now because of that
Hornet, he's dead.

844
00:49:50.668 --> 00:49:52.431
Business affected.

845
00:49:52.603 --> 00:49:55.504
I've got reports of the Green
Hornet shooting out a camera...

846
00:49:55.673 --> 00:49:58.107
I had a report that an
elderly couple claims

847
00:49:58.275 --> 00:50:00.243
he gave the finger
from the HOV Lane.

848
00:50:00.411 --> 00:50:03.437
That saw the Green Hornet and
his chauffeur in a fistfight

849
00:50:03.614 --> 00:50:06.014
with gang members
in South Central.

850
00:50:06.183 --> 00:50:08.811
The Green Hornet raises
questions. We all know that

851
00:50:08.986 --> 00:50:11.250
gang proliferation
has been rising.

852
00:50:11.422 --> 00:50:12.946
Okay, that'll be homework.

853
00:50:13.123 --> 00:50:14.420
I got a yoga class.

854
00:50:14.591 --> 00:50:18.527
Don't worry. Anyhoo, bottom
line: Headlines, people.

855
00:50:18.696 --> 00:50:21.062
Get this story out there.

856
00:50:21.231 --> 00:50:24.098
Will the violence continue to
spill out onto the street?

857
00:50:24.268 --> 00:50:26.395
What are the police
doing about it?

858
00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:30.137
Is anyone safe at the mercy of,

859
00:50:30.341 --> 00:50:32.875
dot, dot, dot, the Green Hornet?

860
00:50:33.043 --> 00:50:35.637
And I want those dots. I want
dots in the paper, okay?

861
00:50:35.813 --> 00:50:37.246
Want us to handle this delicately?

862
00:50:37.748 --> 00:50:38.840
No.

863
00:50:39.216 --> 00:50:40.968
But DA Scanlon's
re-election platform

864
00:50:40.969 --> 00:50:42.674
is based on cleaning
up the streets.

865
00:50:42.853 --> 00:50:44.320
You guys are acquaintances.

866
00:50:44.488 --> 00:50:46.820
So if you want us to...
That's a great idea.

867
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.990
You should use that.

868
00:50:48.125 --> 00:50:49.558
Write an article about that.

869
00:50:49.727 --> 00:50:53.458
Even DA Scanlon is quivering
at the feet of this scourge.

870
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:54.995
Use the word scourge.

871
00:50:55.165 --> 00:50:56.928
- Write an article about that.
- Britt.

872
00:50:57.101 --> 00:50:58.932
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, yeah.

873
00:50:59.103 --> 00:51:01.116
I know what you're
trying to do, turn

874
00:51:01.117 --> 00:51:02.971
this newspaper into a discotheque.

875
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.232
But it's not gonna work.

876
00:51:04.408 --> 00:51:06.603
That's not what I'm doing.
She's a brainy broad.

877
00:51:06.777 --> 00:51:08.301
This is a serious matter, okay?

878
00:51:08.479 --> 00:51:10.470
Every line we print,
there's repercussions.

879
00:51:10.647 --> 00:51:12.979
Somebody has to take
responsibility. That's me.

880
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:14.484
Well, I'm not afraid of these

881
00:51:14.485 --> 00:51:16.278
bastards and you
shouldn't be either.

882
00:51:17.187 --> 00:51:18.187
Neither was Daniel.

883
00:51:18.355 --> 00:51:19.617
He made it to the wall.

884
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:22.520
They killed him for wantonly
speculating on the drug war.

885
00:51:22.693 --> 00:51:26.094
That's exactly what you and your
little girlfriend are doing.

886
00:51:26.263 --> 00:51:28.595
I know you think my
experience ain't worth shit,

887
00:51:28.766 --> 00:51:31.030
but your father listened
to me. So should you.

888
00:51:31.468 --> 00:51:33.368
This is the story I want to run.

889
00:51:33.537 --> 00:51:37.337
I'm going with it, and if he
were still with us, it's what

890
00:51:38.175 --> 00:51:41.542
Daniel Vertell... Vertellah?

891
00:51:41.712 --> 00:51:43.847
- Vertellot? Vertolibe?
- Vertalot.

892
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:45.947
It's what he would've
wanted too. Okay?

893
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:49.546
That's the story, team. Run it.

894
00:51:50.354 --> 00:51:51.685
Britt Reid outro.

895
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:01.390
Bzz. Bzz.

896
00:52:07.838 --> 00:52:08.838
Scourge?

897
00:52:14.545 --> 00:52:16.536
Tail on this Hornet guy.

898
00:52:42.406 --> 00:52:43.464
Yeah.

899
00:52:43.874 --> 00:52:44.874
Red light. Stop.

900
00:52:45.275 --> 00:52:46.299
Shit, the camera got us.

901
00:52:52.416 --> 00:52:53.542
What camera?

902
00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.813
The Green Hornet and
his masked accomplice

903
00:52:58.989 --> 00:53:01.116
stirred up trouble in
the southland today.

904
00:53:01.291 --> 00:53:03.589
Violence has erupted downtown...

905
00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:08.855
Kato? Breakfast in the house. Yes.

906
00:53:09.032 --> 00:53:10.590
I just checked the Hornet mail.

907
00:53:10.767 --> 00:53:13.099
Nothing new, but
they'll be a-knocking.

908
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:14.737
- Sounds great.
- Yeah.

909
00:53:15.939 --> 00:53:19.102
- I have something for you.
- Really? Awesome.

910
00:53:22.779 --> 00:53:26.408
Dear Britt, you are my shon-di.

911
00:53:26.583 --> 00:53:27.583
What's shon-di?

912
00:53:27.584 --> 00:53:28.584
Brother.

913
00:53:29.419 --> 00:53:30.886
That's awfully nice.

914
00:53:32.422 --> 00:53:34.788
I've never had a brother,
man. I always wanted one.

915
00:53:38.662 --> 00:53:40.027
Whoa.

916
00:53:40.564 --> 00:53:41.826
What the hell is this?

917
00:53:42.032 --> 00:53:44.796
It's a gas gun. Your Hornet gun.

918
00:53:44.968 --> 00:53:46.333
- A gas gun?
- Yeah.

919
00:53:46.537 --> 00:53:48.630
Why not a gun gun?

920
00:53:48.805 --> 00:53:50.272
Our enemies have gun guns.

921
00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.567
What? I don't understand.
What are these?

922
00:53:52.743 --> 00:53:55.268
What is this? What are these?
Are these paint balls?

923
00:53:55.445 --> 00:53:57.413
No. Inside is knockout gas.

924
00:53:57.581 --> 00:53:58.946
That's insane.

925
00:53:59.116 --> 00:54:00.777
Where's yours? Do you have one?

926
00:54:00.951 --> 00:54:02.581
Do you have a black version of it?

927
00:54:02.583 --> 00:54:03.583
No, just you.

928
00:54:03.587 --> 00:54:05.418
- No?
- No.

929
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:07.079
Well, why not? Why just me?

930
00:54:07.257 --> 00:54:09.589
You are so special.

931
00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.160
I know, but how come I'm
the only one with a gun?

932
00:54:12.329 --> 00:54:14.511
You don't have much
fighting experience,

933
00:54:14.513 --> 00:54:16.162
so I thought you needed a gun.

934
00:54:16.667 --> 00:54:19.830
Well, I'll be honest, that's
a little insulting, man.

935
00:54:20.003 --> 00:54:21.834
We were both badasses
the other night.

936
00:54:22.005 --> 00:54:24.974
I kicked that guy in the face
like three times. In the face.

937
00:54:25.142 --> 00:54:26.370
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

938
00:54:26.577 --> 00:54:27.805
Yeah.

939
00:54:27.978 --> 00:54:29.343
It makes you look cool.

940
00:54:29.513 --> 00:54:31.481
I need to look cool
now? What the hell?

941
00:54:31.648 --> 00:54:32.979
You said my outfit was pimp.

942
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:36.119
I thought, "That's a weird
word." But you said it was pimp.

943
00:54:36.286 --> 00:54:37.617
- It is pimp.
- Yeah.

944
00:54:37.788 --> 00:54:39.779
The Hornet gun is
just an accessory.

945
00:54:39.957 --> 00:54:40.957
- An accessory?
- Yeah.

946
00:54:41.124 --> 00:54:44.184
Well, then you need
nunchucks, then.

947
00:54:44.661 --> 00:54:46.355
If you don't like
it, don't use it.

948
00:54:46.357 --> 00:54:47.392
How does it work?

949
00:54:48.198 --> 00:54:49.198
Shit.

950
00:54:49.499 --> 00:54:50.625
Hey.

951
00:54:50.801 --> 00:54:52.496
Hey, hey, hey.

952
00:54:52.669 --> 00:54:54.637
Okay. It works.

953
00:55:04.314 --> 00:55:05.314
What the hell?

954
00:55:05.916 --> 00:55:07.349
Kato.

955
00:55:07.618 --> 00:55:08.618
Kato.

956
00:55:08.752 --> 00:55:09.752
I'm here.

957
00:55:12.322 --> 00:55:13.846
Hey, you're awake.

958
00:55:14.024 --> 00:55:15.457
What the hell? What
happened to me?

959
00:55:15.626 --> 00:55:17.355
What's happening? What happened?

960
00:55:17.527 --> 00:55:20.189
You shot yourself in
the face by mistake.

961
00:55:21.164 --> 00:55:23.325
How long was I out?
What time is it?

962
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.762
Two o'clock.

963
00:55:25.235 --> 00:55:26.759
Oh, that's not so bad, I guess.

964
00:55:27.704 --> 00:55:29.001
On Thursday.

965
00:55:29.339 --> 00:55:32.206
It's Thursday? Are you Ki...?
It's not Monday right now?

966
00:55:32.376 --> 00:55:33.400
No. I'm sorry.

967
00:55:41.084 --> 00:55:42.574
Did you put this diaper on me?

968
00:55:47.924 --> 00:55:49.186
Well, what did I miss?

969
00:55:49.359 --> 00:55:50.359
Nothing really.

970
00:55:50.527 --> 00:55:52.825
I did some work on
the Black Beauties.

971
00:55:52.996 --> 00:55:54.054
Beauties?

972
00:55:55.232 --> 00:55:56.722
Holy crap.

973
00:55:56.967 --> 00:55:58.457
Backups.

974
00:55:58.735 --> 00:56:00.965
How the hell did you
do this in four days?

975
00:56:01.171 --> 00:56:02.661
It's been 11 days.

976
00:56:04.941 --> 00:56:08.138
Whoa, 11 days? What?
Are you kidding me?

977
00:56:08.311 --> 00:56:10.905
I wasn't sleeping, I
was in a coma, dick.

978
00:56:11.081 --> 00:56:13.413
But it's okay now, I
fixed the Hornet gas.

979
00:56:13.583 --> 00:56:15.778
The gas only lasts one hour.

980
00:56:15.952 --> 00:56:17.044
Can I see it?

981
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.085
Okay, but be careful
this time. Okay?

982
00:56:19.256 --> 00:56:22.191
I just want to look at it. Just
give it to me for one second...

983
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:27.764
See you in an hour.

984
00:56:27.798 --> 00:56:28.958
Mr Reid.

985
00:56:29.132 --> 00:56:30.132
Hey.

986
00:56:30.267 --> 00:56:32.792
Welcome back. I'm so glad
you're feeling better.

987
00:56:32.969 --> 00:56:34.800
I heard that mono was the worst.

988
00:56:34.971 --> 00:56:36.063
Mono?

989
00:56:38.108 --> 00:56:40.599
Yeah, well, it's better
than herpes, right?

990
00:56:41.645 --> 00:56:43.772
Here are your messages.
I have some meetings

991
00:56:43.947 --> 00:56:45.938
- I'd like to set up with you.
- Cool.

992
00:56:46.116 --> 00:56:47.276
Knock that off.

993
00:56:47.451 --> 00:56:50.647
Here is the research that you
asked for before you got sick.

994
00:56:50.821 --> 00:56:52.686
Green Hornet. Me likey.

995
00:56:52.856 --> 00:56:55.916
DA Scanlon called, he said that
he really needs to speak to you.

996
00:56:56.093 --> 00:56:57.093
Boring.

997
00:56:57.094 --> 00:56:58.758
I need to go look at this stuff.

998
00:57:07.671 --> 00:57:09.332
I read the article you sent me.

999
00:57:09.506 --> 00:57:10.906
What are you doing tonight?

1000
00:57:10.974 --> 00:57:11.974
- Nothing.
- No?

1001
00:57:12.142 --> 00:57:13.142
Nothing at all.

1002
00:57:13.176 --> 00:57:15.059
Thought maybe we
could go get dinner

1003
00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.942
or get a drink, blow
off some steam.

1004
00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.475
Yeah. I would love to.

1005
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:20.750
What time?

1006
00:57:20.751 --> 00:57:21.775
I was thinking 7?

1007
00:57:21.952 --> 00:57:23.180
We could meet downstairs.

1008
00:57:24.621 --> 00:57:25.815
Seven.

1009
00:57:28.692 --> 00:57:31.058
- Perfect. I'll be there.
- Okay.

1010
00:57:33.697 --> 00:57:35.494
Oh. That was awesome.

1011
00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.524
Hey, Kato.

1012
00:57:37.701 --> 00:57:39.828
Can you make me some coffee?

1013
00:57:42.773 --> 00:57:45.173
You don't have your whole
little operation set up,

1014
00:57:45.342 --> 00:57:47.333
but whatever you whip
up would be great.

1015
00:57:47.811 --> 00:57:51.246
Lenore, have you had this
little bastard's coffee?

1016
00:57:51.414 --> 00:57:53.663
Because it is
scrump-diddly-umptious.

1017
00:57:53.664 --> 00:57:55.785
- You want a cup?
- I'm fine, thank you.

1018
00:57:55.919 --> 00:57:58.846
So that's just one
cup of coffee, Kato.

1019
00:57:59.823 --> 00:58:01.553
So there's this
restaurant that just

1020
00:58:01.554 --> 00:58:03.190
opened in the San Fernando Valley,

1021
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.228
and it's called La
Maison des la Voide.

1022
00:58:07.397 --> 00:58:09.991
The whole thing is you eat
your meal in total darkness.

1023
00:58:10.167 --> 00:58:11.361
So with deprived sight,

1024
00:58:11.535 --> 00:58:13.469
each bite is like an
orgasm in your mouth.

1025
00:58:14.871 --> 00:58:16.668
And I was thinking
maybe it would be.

1026
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:18.501
- Mr Reid's office.
- Fun if...

1027
00:58:18.675 --> 00:58:21.075
This is DA Scanlon calling
for Britt Reid, please.

1028
00:58:21.244 --> 00:58:23.178
Hello, sir. I'm aware
you've been calling.

1029
00:58:23.346 --> 00:58:25.007
No, he's had mono.

1030
00:58:25.182 --> 00:58:26.907
Let me look. Maybe
there's a chance

1031
00:58:26.908 --> 00:58:28.345
we could work that out today.

1032
00:58:29.986 --> 00:58:30.986
Ow. Ow.

1033
00:58:31.454 --> 00:58:32.454
Ow.

1034
00:58:32.622 --> 00:58:34.715
If you ever tell me to
get you coffee again,

1035
00:58:34.891 --> 00:58:36.449
I'll beat the shit out of you.

1036
00:58:36.626 --> 00:58:39.254
What are you? What is wrong
with you? Are you crazy?

1037
00:58:39.429 --> 00:58:42.091
This is our plan, you're
supposed to work for me.

1038
00:58:42.265 --> 00:58:43.698
You got me a Jamba Juice.

1039
00:58:43.867 --> 00:58:45.630
We're supposed to
be brothers, man.

1040
00:58:45.836 --> 00:58:47.701
We're supposed to be shon-di.

1041
00:58:47.871 --> 00:58:49.736
What happened to that, huh?

1042
00:58:49.906 --> 00:58:51.066
I'm sorry.

1043
00:58:51.241 --> 00:58:52.640
You should be sorry.

1044
00:58:52.843 --> 00:58:56.040
We've become superheroes and
there's a lot of stress involved,

1045
00:58:56.213 --> 00:58:58.340
but you don't gotta
freak out about it.

1046
00:58:59.082 --> 00:59:00.413
Now can I have the coffee?

1047
00:59:00.584 --> 00:59:02.848
I'm joking. I'm totally joking.

1048
00:59:03.253 --> 00:59:04.777
You still mad at me, Kato?

1049
00:59:04.955 --> 00:59:05.979
No.

1050
00:59:06.156 --> 00:59:07.156
Good.

1051
00:59:07.357 --> 00:59:09.086
Because you shouldn't be anyway.

1052
00:59:09.259 --> 00:59:10.521
What's up with Lenore, man?

1053
00:59:10.694 --> 00:59:12.286
Is she acting weird around me?

1054
00:59:12.562 --> 00:59:13.562
No, why?

1055
00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:14.730
I "like" like her.

1056
00:59:15.098 --> 00:59:17.760
And I can't nail her. She's
completely un-nailable.

1057
00:59:17.934 --> 00:59:20.425
It's a terrible fact. I
don't know what to do.

1058
00:59:20.604 --> 00:59:23.095
She doesn't like you,
why would you want her?

1059
00:59:23.273 --> 00:59:26.106
Maybe it's because she doesn't
like me. Isn't that sick?

1060
00:59:26.276 --> 00:59:27.607
That could be it.

1061
00:59:28.144 --> 00:59:31.773
Girls are such a drag, Kato.
Thank God we have each other.

1062
00:59:32.249 --> 00:59:35.912
Hey. I'm calling a boys'
night. What do you say, huh?

1063
00:59:36.086 --> 00:59:37.086
What are you doing?

1064
00:59:37.254 --> 00:59:39.322
I didn't know you
wanted to hang out.

1065
00:59:39.323 --> 00:59:41.281
I'm going for drinks
with a friend.

1066
00:59:41.458 --> 00:59:43.756
Friend? Who? Come on.

1067
00:59:44.461 --> 00:59:45.519
Tony.

1068
00:59:45.695 --> 00:59:46.753
Tony?

1069
00:59:48.598 --> 00:59:49.997
Well, have fun.

1070
00:59:50.166 --> 00:59:52.134
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Can I come?

1071
00:59:57.941 --> 00:59:59.431
- You want to try?
- No.

1072
00:59:59.609 --> 01:00:01.008
Hit the black key.

1073
01:00:01.211 --> 01:00:02.803
- Really?
- Yeah.

1074
01:00:02.979 --> 01:00:04.469
Okay, I'll try. Which one?

1075
01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:19.524
You know, this Green Hornet
thing is just crazy, isn't it?

1076
01:00:19.696 --> 01:00:21.857
I mean, it's all I can
think about sometimes.

1077
01:00:22.933 --> 01:00:24.882
I feel really in tuned
with it. Kind of

1078
01:00:24.883 --> 01:00:26.733
like that guy with
the Zodiac Killer.

1079
01:00:26.937 --> 01:00:28.962
What about the man
dressed in black?

1080
01:00:30.006 --> 01:00:31.371
Johnny Cash?

1081
01:00:31.541 --> 01:00:33.202
No. His partner.

1082
01:00:33.376 --> 01:00:36.709
His partner. No, I don't think
that that's his partner.

1083
01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.848
That's probably just
some thug he hired.

1084
01:00:39.015 --> 01:00:40.642
Anyhow, they'll both
be dead in no time.

1085
01:00:41.985 --> 01:00:43.009
Yeah.

1086
01:00:44.054 --> 01:00:45.054
Why?

1087
01:00:45.088 --> 01:00:48.182
Because the Green Hornet's been
attracting way too much attention.

1088
01:00:48.358 --> 01:00:50.918
Whoever's in charge is
gonna get tired of it,

1089
01:00:51.094 --> 01:00:53.358
call him in to make a
deal, then kill him.

1090
01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:55.964
It's what Gotti did
to Mangela in '87.

1091
01:00:56.166 --> 01:00:58.896
In two weeks. Two weeks, tops,
that's what I give them.

1092
01:00:59.069 --> 01:01:00.437
- Two weeks?
- Dead.

1093
01:01:01.771 --> 01:01:04.934
You're not gonna like
this, but we got nothing.

1094
01:01:05.108 --> 01:01:07.372
It's like the Green
Hornet didn't exist.

1095
01:01:07.544 --> 01:01:10.270
Nobody's done a deal with
him, done time with him.

1096
01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.538
Nobody's heard of him.

1097
01:01:11.715 --> 01:01:13.546
It's like he came out of thin air.

1098
01:01:13.717 --> 01:01:15.742
Yeah, and I've gotta say,

1099
01:01:15.986 --> 01:01:18.750
he's setting a bad example
for the other gangs.

1100
01:01:18.922 --> 01:01:20.617
I met with the Armenians today.

1101
01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:23.623
They told me if the
Hornet is independent,

1102
01:01:23.793 --> 01:01:26.091
they wanna be independent too.

1103
01:01:26.696 --> 01:01:28.527
The Armenians truly said that?

1104
01:01:29.065 --> 01:01:32.000
And I heard rumours the
Koreans are talking the same.

1105
01:01:32.268 --> 01:01:33.428
Which Korean?

1106
01:01:33.903 --> 01:01:35.063
Kim.

1107
01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.905
Kim?

1108
01:01:39.876 --> 01:01:42.470
No, Kim never said that.

1109
01:01:42.645 --> 01:01:45.546
No, we've been doing business
for 25 years. We're friends.

1110
01:01:46.249 --> 01:01:47.876
I'm sorry, boss.

1111
01:01:48.151 --> 01:01:49.641
That's just shocking.

1112
01:01:49.819 --> 01:01:52.413
Maybe we should go down
there and teach them

1113
01:01:52.589 --> 01:01:53.988
to keep their mouths shut.

1114
01:01:54.157 --> 01:01:55.157
No.

1115
01:01:55.158 --> 01:01:56.290
- No.
- No.

1116
01:01:56.593 --> 01:01:59.585
I should kill Kim
myself. He's a friend.

1117
01:02:00.663 --> 01:02:03.496
And I'll kill the Armenians
too. It'll make me feel better.

1118
01:02:03.666 --> 01:02:05.930
Wait. Wait.

1119
01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:08.533
Great. What about The Hornet?

1120
01:02:15.645 --> 01:02:16.839
Britt?

1121
01:02:18.415 --> 01:02:19.746
What you doing here?

1122
01:02:19.916 --> 01:02:22.476
Guess what, you son of a bitch.

1123
01:02:24.788 --> 01:02:26.187
We got mail.

1124
01:02:26.356 --> 01:02:29.621
We got Hornet mail. He
e-mailed. It happened.

1125
01:02:29.793 --> 01:02:32.990
Come here, look. Come
here. Look, look, look.

1126
01:02:33.696 --> 01:02:35.857
Green Hornet. Me.

1127
01:02:36.066 --> 01:02:38.227
Good job on the meth lab.

1128
01:02:38.401 --> 01:02:41.165
The place was costing me money
and I wanted to shut it down.

1129
01:02:41.337 --> 01:02:42.337
That's B.S.

1130
01:02:42.338 --> 01:02:45.535
Let's talk about another venture
that could be mutually beneficial.

1131
01:02:45.708 --> 01:02:48.802
Please meet tomorrow at the
lot on Fifth and Union

1132
01:02:48.978 --> 01:02:51.071
in downtown at 4 p.m.

1133
01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:54.211
Another adventure for
the Green Hornet

1134
01:02:54.384 --> 01:02:56.545
and his nameless sidekick.

1135
01:02:59.489 --> 01:03:01.821
Looks like we've got
some planning to do.

1136
01:03:01.991 --> 01:03:03.686
It could be a trap.

1137
01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:07.159
Like how Gotti killed
Mangela in '87.

1138
01:03:07.897 --> 01:03:09.455
Where did you hear that from?

1139
01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.595
The History Channel.

1140
01:03:13.169 --> 01:03:14.169
Oh, yeah?

1141
01:03:14.237 --> 01:03:17.065
Should we go downtown
now and check it out?

1142
01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.071
No, that's cool. I
got that covered.

1143
01:03:19.242 --> 01:03:21.369
You fill up the car
with weapons and stuff.

1144
01:03:21.544 --> 01:03:25.605
So you're just gonna come up
with the plan by yourself?

1145
01:03:26.182 --> 01:03:27.308
Bingo.

1146
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:29.880
I don't know if
that's the best idea.

1147
01:03:30.053 --> 01:03:31.714
- Course you don't.
- What's that mean?

1148
01:03:31.888 --> 01:03:35.016
Oh, it means that you think
you're an awesome karate dude

1149
01:03:35.191 --> 01:03:38.092
that can do anything, and that
I'm an incompetent schmuck

1150
01:03:38.261 --> 01:03:40.661
who needs a gun that
shoots farts at people.

1151
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:42.764
I'm saying, we should
do this together.

1152
01:03:42.932 --> 01:03:44.422
I'm saying you should go home.

1153
01:03:44.634 --> 01:03:47.053
You should go to sleep
so tomorrow you

1154
01:03:47.054 --> 01:03:49.162
could process my incredible plan.

1155
01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.000
Fine.

1156
01:03:55.044 --> 01:03:56.671
This is so stupid.

1157
01:03:56.846 --> 01:03:58.837
We pissed this guy off.

1158
01:03:59.015 --> 01:04:00.642
Now we're walking into his turf.

1159
01:04:00.817 --> 01:04:03.149
We walked into their turf
last time and guess what.

1160
01:04:03.319 --> 01:04:05.014
We kicked the crap out of them.

1161
01:04:05.188 --> 01:04:08.123
And everyone knows: What happens
when you corner a hornet?

1162
01:04:08.291 --> 01:04:09.349
You get stung.

1163
01:04:09.526 --> 01:04:11.460
You get stung. What
does that mean?

1164
01:04:11.628 --> 01:04:14.995
This is not a game, Britt. And
you're gonna get us killed.

1165
01:04:15.165 --> 01:04:18.726
If you don't like my plan, you
do not have to be a part of it.

1166
01:04:18.935 --> 01:04:20.926
- I don't think you have a plan.
- I do.

1167
01:04:21.104 --> 01:04:22.503
I just haven't told you yet.

1168
01:04:22.672 --> 01:04:24.663
And it's amazing, okay?

1169
01:04:24.841 --> 01:04:27.537
So are you in, or are you
chickening out like a bitch?

1170
01:04:27.877 --> 01:04:28.877
You are a bitch.

1171
01:04:29.045 --> 01:04:31.240
Not now, Kato, not
now. Turn in here.

1172
01:04:36.819 --> 01:04:39.379
There they are. Game
faces, Kato. Game faces.

1173
01:04:41.524 --> 01:04:43.685
Here's the plan. Take
this, put it in your ear.

1174
01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:47.152
You listen in on my phone,
which I've taped to my chest.

1175
01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:50.527
When I say the secret word,
which is Constantinople,

1176
01:04:50.833 --> 01:04:54.030
I'll kick the old guy in the nuts,
you blow them up with missiles.

1177
01:04:54.204 --> 01:04:56.331
Whoa. Truck. Kato, back up.

1178
01:04:56.506 --> 01:04:57.598
Back up. Back up.

1179
01:04:57.774 --> 01:04:59.241
Okay, okay, okay.

1180
01:05:01.411 --> 01:05:02.776
This is not part of the plan.

1181
01:05:02.946 --> 01:05:03.946
No shit.

1182
01:05:06.916 --> 01:05:07.916
Oh.

1183
01:05:15.091 --> 01:05:18.356
And so thunder strikes lightning.

1184
01:05:22.799 --> 01:05:24.357
Okay, don't panic.

1185
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:28.435
The worst thing we can
do right now is panic.

1186
01:05:28.605 --> 01:05:30.232
Just let me think.

1187
01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:38.946
Okay, don't worry. I'll
get us out of here, okay?

1188
01:05:39.115 --> 01:05:41.777
No, you won't. We're gonna
die now, you ass-wipe.

1189
01:05:41.951 --> 01:05:44.442
Well, with that attitude
we will. Come on, man.

1190
01:05:49.025 --> 01:05:51.260
I think I'm claustrophobic.
Let me think.

1191
01:05:51.261 --> 01:05:52.261
Oh, no.

1192
01:05:52.262 --> 01:05:53.559
I can't breathe. Listen, listen.

1193
01:05:58.668 --> 01:06:00.329
We're buried. We are
totally buried.

1194
01:06:00.536 --> 01:06:02.231
Okay, okay.

1195
01:06:02.472 --> 01:06:03.837
What are you doing?

1196
01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.565
Either killing us or saving us.

1197
01:06:06.743 --> 01:06:08.677
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Missiles armed?

1198
01:06:08.845 --> 01:06:10.245
That's your plan?
You'll blow us up.

1199
01:06:10.346 --> 01:06:11.904
That's not a good plan.

1200
01:06:12.081 --> 01:06:13.309
Disarm them, man.

1201
01:06:13.616 --> 01:06:14.947
Shall we part?

1202
01:06:15.952 --> 01:06:17.442
Feel like kebabs for dinner?

1203
01:06:23.593 --> 01:06:24.593
Look out.

1204
01:06:29.265 --> 01:06:30.459
Chilli.

1205
01:06:31.701 --> 01:06:33.669
They killed him.
They killed Chilli.

1206
01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.226
[KATO SPEAKS IN MANDARIN]

1207
01:06:43.479 --> 01:06:44.479
Run.

1208
01:06:52.121 --> 01:06:53.520
Oh, shit.

1209
01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:55.590
- There's thorns in these bushes.
- Shut up.

1210
01:06:55.758 --> 01:06:56.758
Shut up.

1211
01:07:00.096 --> 01:07:01.256
This thing has no aim.

1212
01:07:01.297 --> 01:07:02.297
It sucks.

1213
01:07:02.365 --> 01:07:03.730
You have no aim.

1214
01:07:07.036 --> 01:07:08.036
Britt.

1215
01:07:15.812 --> 01:07:16.812
What?

1216
01:07:26.356 --> 01:07:28.881
I smash window, you shoot in.

1217
01:07:29.258 --> 01:07:30.919
Every man for himself.

1218
01:07:39.502 --> 01:07:40.502
Go away.

1219
01:07:41.871 --> 01:07:42.871
Die.

1220
01:07:43.439 --> 01:07:44.439
Oh, shit.

1221
01:08:08.231 --> 01:08:10.722
So you just gonna ignore
me now, is that it?

1222
01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.390
Like a baby?

1223
01:08:12.702 --> 01:08:15.227
And go home, eat some
baby food maybe?

1224
01:08:15.405 --> 01:08:16.895
Drink some milk?

1225
01:08:17.073 --> 01:08:18.313
Why don't you talk like a baby.

1226
01:08:18.441 --> 01:08:20.534
Mama, goo-goo. You baby.

1227
01:08:25.515 --> 01:08:26.982
Waah.

1228
01:08:27.183 --> 01:08:28.912
Waah.

1229
01:08:29.085 --> 01:08:30.484
Baby.

1230
01:08:32.688 --> 01:08:36.385
Explosives were triggered from
that vehicle, destroying it,

1231
01:08:36.559 --> 01:08:38.493
- freeing the Green Hornet...
- Dickweed.

1232
01:08:39.562 --> 01:08:42.087
You're calling me that too?
I know people call me that.

1233
01:08:42.265 --> 01:08:44.256
That's not a surprise.
That's not a mystery.

1234
01:08:44.434 --> 01:08:45.492
Why not?

1235
01:08:45.768 --> 01:08:47.929
You say rude things to
me all day, every day.

1236
01:08:48.104 --> 01:08:49.469
That's not how partners work.

1237
01:08:49.639 --> 01:08:50.799
We're not partners.

1238
01:08:50.973 --> 01:08:53.441
I'm the hero, you're my sidekick.

1239
01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:55.008
That's what this is.

1240
01:08:55.178 --> 01:08:56.975
I'm Indy, you're Short Round.

1241
01:08:57.146 --> 01:08:59.478
Simon, Garfunkel.

1242
01:08:59.649 --> 01:09:02.015
Scooby, Doo.

1243
01:09:02.185 --> 01:09:04.847
Stop fooling yourself. Green
Hornet is nothing without me.

1244
01:09:05.021 --> 01:09:06.602
I made the knockout gas. I alone

1245
01:09:06.603 --> 01:09:08.479
designed and built
the Black Beauty.

1246
01:09:09.292 --> 01:09:10.782
And I didn't help at all?

1247
01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.518
- How?
- Ejector seats?

1248
01:09:12.728 --> 01:09:13.786
Exactly.

1249
01:09:14.297 --> 01:09:15.958
What a great idea.

1250
01:09:16.332 --> 01:09:18.527
You may have started
this Green Hornet thing

1251
01:09:18.734 --> 01:09:20.531
because you hated your father.

1252
01:09:21.737 --> 01:09:23.466
- You're an egomaniac.
- I know.

1253
01:09:24.307 --> 01:09:26.172
Exactly like your father.

1254
01:09:26.742 --> 01:09:30.940
You are a jealous,
pathetic little man.

1255
01:09:31.113 --> 01:09:33.308
Fine. You're doing
great with Lenore.

1256
01:09:33.649 --> 01:09:35.207
What the hell does that mean?

1257
01:09:35.384 --> 01:09:37.614
Oh, oh. Don't you
walk away on that.

1258
01:09:37.787 --> 01:09:40.221
What, you're charming her
pants off, that's what

1259
01:09:40.389 --> 01:09:41.686
I'm supposed to believe?

1260
01:09:42.825 --> 01:09:45.191
No, that is a filthy gesture.

1261
01:09:45.361 --> 01:09:46.453
You know I like her.

1262
01:09:46.629 --> 01:09:48.187
I confided in you, Kato.

1263
01:09:48.364 --> 01:09:50.559
I trusted you. I told
you I liked her.

1264
01:09:50.733 --> 01:09:53.133
Stop it. You hit on
everything that moves.

1265
01:09:53.302 --> 01:09:56.663
I'm amazed you haven't
hit on me yet.

1266
01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:00.900
If you keep talking
like this, Kato,

1267
01:10:01.077 --> 01:10:03.012
I'm gonna beat the
shit out of you.

1268
01:10:03.079 --> 01:10:05.809
Just so you know. I'd
like to see you try.

1269
01:10:05.982 --> 01:10:07.347
You are a yuppie wimp,

1270
01:10:07.517 --> 01:10:10.816
and I'm a martial arts expert who
grew up penniless on the streets.

1271
01:10:10.987 --> 01:10:13.182
You grew up penis-less
on the streets.

1272
01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:14.890
Funny.

1273
01:10:14.891 --> 01:10:17.257
Heroes beat sidekicks, period.

1274
01:10:17.426 --> 01:10:18.757
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

1275
01:10:18.928 --> 01:10:20.054
I'm warning you.

1276
01:10:24.567 --> 01:10:28.198
Okay, I'm gonna forget that
slap so we can fix this.

1277
01:10:28.371 --> 01:10:30.566
Okay, okay, you're
right. You're right.

1278
01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:33.208
Let's talk. I'm sorry.

1279
01:10:34.911 --> 01:10:37.505
Sacked you like a bitch, Kato.

1280
01:10:42.385 --> 01:10:44.319
Come here. Chop-chop.

1281
01:10:47.623 --> 01:10:50.615
You like that, Kato? You like
it? This is what you get

1282
01:10:50.793 --> 01:10:52.693
when you corner a hornet.

1283
01:10:52.929 --> 01:10:53.929
You get...

1284
01:10:54.196 --> 01:10:55.424
Oh, God.

1285
01:11:02.605 --> 01:11:03.697
Now I'm gonna hurt you.

1286
01:11:03.873 --> 01:11:05.363
I'd like to see you try.

1287
01:11:10.646 --> 01:11:13.541
Get this stupid thing off
me, you cheating bastard.

1288
01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.120
You dirty bastard.

1289
01:11:34.937 --> 01:11:35.995
You idiot.

1290
01:11:36.672 --> 01:11:37.764
Okay, let's...

1291
01:11:39.742 --> 01:11:40.970
Can we end this?

1292
01:11:47.583 --> 01:11:49.073
You are so stubborn.

1293
01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.327
Do you like it? You like it?

1294
01:12:06.502 --> 01:12:07.799
No, I don't like it.

1295
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:09.198
You like it? You like it?

1296
01:12:09.372 --> 01:12:10.372
I don't like it.

1297
01:12:18.314 --> 01:12:21.613
Okay. Now we can end this.

1298
01:12:22.184 --> 01:12:24.118
Just stop. Just stop.

1299
01:12:24.286 --> 01:12:25.344
Just stop. Stop.

1300
01:12:25.521 --> 01:12:26.521
Just stop. Stop.

1301
01:12:26.555 --> 01:12:27.555
Stop, stop, stop.

1302
01:12:35.231 --> 01:12:36.231
Britt.

1303
01:12:37.533 --> 01:12:38.533
Britt.

1304
01:12:40.069 --> 01:12:41.195
Help.

1305
01:12:43.806 --> 01:12:44.806
Help.

1306
01:12:53.015 --> 01:12:54.880
Get out of my pool.

1307
01:12:56.452 --> 01:12:57.919
Get off my property.

1308
01:12:58.087 --> 01:12:59.714
You're fired.

1309
01:12:59.889 --> 01:13:01.584
- Never come back.
- Help.

1310
01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.693
I can't swim.

1311
01:13:12.535 --> 01:13:14.196
Britt. Britt.

1312
01:13:39.128 --> 01:13:40.254
Lenore, it's me.

1313
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:42.361
It's me, Kato.

1314
01:13:43.099 --> 01:13:44.396
What the hell?

1315
01:13:44.567 --> 01:13:46.016
That's for whatever
lie you told Britt.

1316
01:13:46.018 --> 01:13:47.018
What?

1317
01:13:47.069 --> 01:13:49.264
He called me a minx,
and then he fired me.

1318
01:13:52.575 --> 01:13:54.941
Chilli was a fine warrior.

1319
01:13:56.145 --> 01:13:58.545
He was a man of
honour and dignity.

1320
01:14:00.049 --> 01:14:02.017
We must show our respect.

1321
01:14:03.085 --> 01:14:04.780
And we must show it in blood.

1322
01:14:05.621 --> 01:14:07.555
Popeye, go forth.

1323
01:14:08.057 --> 01:14:10.389
Take these words and spread them:

1324
01:14:10.926 --> 01:14:13.895
The bounty, 1 million dollars.

1325
01:14:14.063 --> 01:14:16.793
The prey, the Green Hornet.

1326
01:14:16.966 --> 01:14:18.991
Dead, if possible.

1327
01:14:19.168 --> 01:14:21.398
Alive, if necessary.

1328
01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:25.267
I don't care whence they have
to go, or who they have to do.

1329
01:14:25.441 --> 01:14:29.036
I want the head of the Green
Hornet, and I want it tonight.

1330
01:14:29.345 --> 01:14:31.540
Find him. Kill him. Take him out.

1331
01:14:40.256 --> 01:14:41.314
How do you do?

1332
01:14:41.490 --> 01:14:43.958
Everybody, chase The Hornet.

1333
01:14:44.126 --> 01:14:46.788
It's about The Hornet.
We want him dead.

1334
01:14:46.962 --> 01:14:47.962
All right.

1335
01:14:48.798 --> 01:14:50.129
Hey, you, do me a favour.

1336
01:14:50.299 --> 01:14:52.859
Listen to me. He's got a mask on.

1337
01:14:53.068 --> 01:14:54.694
I need you to spread
the word, all right?

1338
01:14:54.696 --> 01:14:55.696
Kill him.

1339
01:14:55.698 --> 01:14:57.222
- The mask was green.
- Yeah.

1340
01:14:57.373 --> 01:14:58.431
Yo.

1341
01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:02.210
A green mask.

1342
01:15:02.378 --> 01:15:04.710
- A hit on The Hornet.
- A million bucks.

1343
01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.880
Good, good.

1344
01:15:06.048 --> 01:15:07.879
- What's going on?
- What's the word?

1345
01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:11.715
- Listen, this Green Hornet.
- He's got a mask on.

1346
01:15:11.887 --> 01:15:13.727
- One million dollar.
- The Green Hornet.

1347
01:15:13.823 --> 01:15:16.018
- You got it.
- All right.

1348
01:15:16.325 --> 01:15:17.383
Hey, Jacko.

1349
01:15:17.593 --> 01:15:19.652
Hey, man, you wanna
make a few bucks?

1350
01:15:45.154 --> 01:15:47.816
You failed to kill me
The Hornet, Popeye.

1351
01:15:55.865 --> 01:15:58.026
I warned you about this.

1352
01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.963
You heightened this
thing to a point

1353
01:16:00.135 --> 01:16:02.535
where it had to reach
some kind of a climax.

1354
01:16:02.705 --> 01:16:04.900
Well, here it is.

1355
01:16:07.376 --> 01:16:10.573
I hope you realise now that you
should stay out of my way.

1356
01:16:10.746 --> 01:16:12.839
Let me run this paper.

1357
01:16:18.954 --> 01:16:22.014
A gruesome scene last night as
bodies were found across the city,

1358
01:16:22.191 --> 01:16:24.853
every one of them
wearing green clothing.

1359
01:16:26.228 --> 01:16:27.819
Investigators believe
the slaughter

1360
01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:28.924
was part of a manhunt...

1361
01:16:29.098 --> 01:16:30.588
DA Scanlon's office, please.

1362
01:16:31.066 --> 01:16:33.500
The victims were unrelated
and authorities believe

1363
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:35.927
their only connection was
their choice of attire.

1364
01:16:35.928 --> 01:16:38.827
As a precaution,
police are advising

1365
01:16:38.874 --> 01:16:42.139
citizens to avoid wearing the
colour green, so as not to be

1366
01:16:42.311 --> 01:16:44.074
unwittingly targeted.

1367
01:16:45.614 --> 01:16:48.105
This is my fault. This is
what I did with this paper.

1368
01:16:48.284 --> 01:16:49.284
So what?

1369
01:16:49.285 --> 01:16:52.652
At least you tried. Your dad
would have understood that.

1370
01:16:52.821 --> 01:16:55.153
Look, running a newspaper
must be difficult.

1371
01:16:55.324 --> 01:16:58.851
I mean, if it's anything like
running a re-election campaign,

1372
01:16:59.028 --> 01:17:01.724
it's gotta be a pain
in the ass. Heh, heh.

1373
01:17:01.897 --> 01:17:06.061
Fortunately, I think we can
make each other's lives easier.

1374
01:17:06.835 --> 01:17:08.097
How?

1375
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:09.999
There are two sides
to every story.

1376
01:17:10.205 --> 01:17:13.140
I mean, some people, they
see an event and they

1377
01:17:13.309 --> 01:17:16.244
interpret it as this
crime war, you know?

1378
01:17:16.412 --> 01:17:18.141
Other people see the same incident

1379
01:17:18.314 --> 01:17:20.612
and they interpret it
as an isolated event.

1380
01:17:20.783 --> 01:17:23.115
Yeah. I guess I could...

1381
01:17:24.787 --> 01:17:28.154
help you decide how these
incidents are exposed.

1382
01:17:28.324 --> 01:17:30.087
In the public interest, of course.

1383
01:17:30.259 --> 01:17:34.286
Now, if this collaboration
leads to assert my position,

1384
01:17:34.463 --> 01:17:40.164
well, I will make sure that you
enjoy compensation in return.

1385
01:17:41.770 --> 01:17:43.761
What kind of compensation?

1386
01:17:45.541 --> 01:17:47.236
Frank, are you?

1387
01:17:47.509 --> 01:17:49.875
Are you saying you want
me to slant the news

1388
01:17:50.045 --> 01:17:52.275
for your re-election?
Is that what this is?

1389
01:17:52.448 --> 01:17:53.813
I thought you needed my help.

1390
01:17:53.983 --> 01:17:59.220
We help each other out so
that we can both get ahead.

1391
01:17:59.388 --> 01:18:01.754
This is mutually beneficial.

1392
01:18:02.958 --> 01:18:04.949
Okay, I get it now.

1393
01:18:05.527 --> 01:18:07.620
You went to my dad, he
rejected your offer,

1394
01:18:07.796 --> 01:18:09.821
and you think you
can push me around.

1395
01:18:10.165 --> 01:18:11.826
That's what you think?

1396
01:18:12.001 --> 01:18:13.764
No, what I think

1397
01:18:14.269 --> 01:18:17.466
is that you overvalue
your dad's integrity.

1398
01:18:19.208 --> 01:18:22.268
You get out of my office
right this second.

1399
01:18:27.349 --> 01:18:29.078
This might be what
you're looking for.

1400
01:18:29.284 --> 01:18:30.284
Thank you.

1401
01:18:30.452 --> 01:18:31.510
You're welcome.

1402
01:18:56.712 --> 01:18:58.043
Stay here.

1403
01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:03.214
Boss, what are you doing up here?

1404
01:19:03.385 --> 01:19:05.046
We were waiting for you down...

1405
01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:06.414
Come here.

1406
01:19:08.257 --> 01:19:10.088
I've been doing some thinking.

1407
01:19:10.592 --> 01:19:12.719
And I had a revelation.

1408
01:19:12.961 --> 01:19:14.690
Look, I'm obsolete.

1409
01:19:14.863 --> 01:19:16.558
I'm a dinosaur.

1410
01:19:16.732 --> 01:19:19.098
Not in the scary way,
in the extinct way.

1411
01:19:19.268 --> 01:19:20.860
And it's time for changes.

1412
01:19:21.036 --> 01:19:23.664
You know, it's time for
me to gain some...

1413
01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:26.105
charisma.

1414
01:19:26.842 --> 01:19:29.208
I've no idea what you're
talking about. I mean...

1415
01:19:29.378 --> 01:19:33.610
Ha, ha. I'm talking
about a motif. A theme.

1416
01:19:33.782 --> 01:19:34.782
A mask.

1417
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:36.815
Perhaps a stylish cape.

1418
01:19:36.985 --> 01:19:39.351
I'm talking about the
death of Chudnofsky

1419
01:19:39.521 --> 01:19:42.354
and the rebirth of Bloodnofsky.

1420
01:19:43.625 --> 01:19:44.751
What do you say?

1421
01:19:47.029 --> 01:19:48.029
Honestly?

1422
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:49.088
Yeah.

1423
01:19:50.099 --> 01:19:54.058
I think that is the stupidest
thing I have ever heard.

1424
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:56.599
Why is that stupid?

1425
01:19:56.772 --> 01:19:58.433
That's not stupid.

1426
01:19:59.374 --> 01:20:00.966
Bloodnofsky.

1427
01:20:02.478 --> 01:20:04.503
I was gonna wear red.

1428
01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.443
For blood, get it?

1429
01:20:06.815 --> 01:20:08.407
That's scary.

1430
01:20:08.684 --> 01:20:10.151
And cool.

1431
01:20:10.486 --> 01:20:11.783
Get this:

1432
01:20:12.488 --> 01:20:14.679
Be it my mask or
your blood, red will

1433
01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.754
be the last colour
you'll ever see.

1434
01:20:18.794 --> 01:20:20.989
I say that to people
when I kill them.

1435
01:20:21.163 --> 01:20:23.188
The Green Hornet killed Chilli.

1436
01:20:23.398 --> 01:20:25.889
I am minus an eyeball here.

1437
01:20:26.068 --> 01:20:28.935
You can't go and tell these
guys that, they'll think you've

1438
01:20:29.104 --> 01:20:30.435
lost your bloody mind.

1439
01:20:30.672 --> 01:20:33.004
I think you're having a
midlife crisis here.

1440
01:20:33.175 --> 01:20:35.109
Seriously, you're
starting to scare me.

1441
01:20:37.212 --> 01:20:38.645
Want to know a secret?

1442
01:20:39.848 --> 01:20:41.839
I'm starting to scare myself.

1443
01:20:48.624 --> 01:20:53.459
Gentlemen, the reign of
Bloodnofsky starts tonight.

1444
01:20:59.935 --> 01:21:02.165
- Hey. I'm sorry I fired you.
- Get out of here.

1445
01:21:02.337 --> 01:21:04.362
I shouldn't have
called you a minx.

1446
01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.030
Look, please, just listen to me.

1447
01:21:06.208 --> 01:21:07.903
Kato lied about us, okay?

1448
01:21:08.076 --> 01:21:10.340
You should have found that
out before you fire me.

1449
01:21:10.512 --> 01:21:12.173
- Nothing happened?
- No.

1450
01:21:12.347 --> 01:21:15.248
Oh, thank God. I knew it.
I knew nothing happened.

1451
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:17.518
That ass. He said you did this.

1452
01:21:17.519 --> 01:21:19.120
What? What is that?

1453
01:21:19.121 --> 01:21:21.549
I don't know. It's gross.
That's not why I'm here.

1454
01:21:21.723 --> 01:21:23.418
I need you to come back and work.

1455
01:21:23.592 --> 01:21:25.924
I'll do whatever you want.
I'll double your salary.

1456
01:21:26.094 --> 01:21:28.824
Things at The Sentinel?
Not what they seem.

1457
01:21:28.997 --> 01:21:30.726
As soon as Scanlon
started running,

1458
01:21:31.433 --> 01:21:33.833
my father stopped printing
news about hard crime.

1459
01:21:34.002 --> 01:21:35.560
He was making Scanlon look good.

1460
01:21:35.737 --> 01:21:37.967
And I have to make it right.

1461
01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:42.401
And I realised that if I want to
do what's best for this world...

1462
01:21:42.578 --> 01:21:45.945
that The Daily Sentinel is the
most responsible way to do that.

1463
01:21:46.114 --> 01:21:47.547
But here's the problem:

1464
01:21:47.716 --> 01:21:50.794
I don't know anything
about journalism.

1465
01:21:50.796 --> 01:21:52.488
That's the truth.

1466
01:21:52.788 --> 01:21:54.915
Look, I need someone who does.

1467
01:21:55.090 --> 01:21:58.082
I need someone who I can
trust with my life.

1468
01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.522
I'm just... Okay?

1469
01:21:59.995 --> 01:22:02.930
I need someone who is
you. I need you, Lenore.

1470
01:22:03.565 --> 01:22:05.931
Will you please help me?

1471
01:22:08.937 --> 01:22:10.199
Britt, I...

1472
01:22:11.139 --> 01:22:12.629
I know, I know.

1473
01:22:13.275 --> 01:22:14.708
Oh, my God.

1474
01:22:16.245 --> 01:22:17.644
Oh, God.

1475
01:22:17.879 --> 01:22:19.369
What is your problem?

1476
01:22:19.548 --> 01:22:20.548
God.

1477
01:22:20.549 --> 01:22:21.743
Why did you do that to me?

1478
01:22:21.917 --> 01:22:23.248
Because you tried to kiss me.

1479
01:22:23.418 --> 01:22:25.716
- Yeah, we were gonna make out.
- No, we weren't.

1480
01:22:26.088 --> 01:22:28.955
Then I guess I owe you an
apology, because I misread that.

1481
01:22:29.124 --> 01:22:30.124
As usual.

1482
01:22:30.292 --> 01:22:32.010
Okay. Look, I'm
sorry. I didn't plan

1483
01:22:32.011 --> 01:22:33.728
on kissing you when
I said all that.

1484
01:22:33.895 --> 01:22:35.886
Will you come back and
work for me, please?

1485
01:22:36.064 --> 01:22:37.122
Pretty please?

1486
01:22:37.299 --> 01:22:38.789
Double my salary.

1487
01:22:39.134 --> 01:22:40.726
And I want a parking spot.

1488
01:22:40.902 --> 01:22:43.166
You don't have a parking
spot? Oh, that sucks.

1489
01:22:43.338 --> 01:22:46.501
And if you ever so much as
look at my ass again...

1490
01:22:46.675 --> 01:22:47.675
I can't even see it.

1491
01:22:48.677 --> 01:22:51.475
I will sue you for sexual
harassment. Do you understand?

1492
01:22:52.147 --> 01:22:53.147
Hugs?

1493
01:22:53.348 --> 01:22:55.407
Where my hugs at, you all?

1494
01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:26.714
- Britt Reid's office.
- Frank Scanlon.

1495
01:23:26.882 --> 01:23:28.747
Oh. Please hold.

1496
01:23:28.918 --> 01:23:30.280
DA Scanlon.

1497
01:23:30.552 --> 01:23:31.985
- Really?
- Yes.

1498
01:23:33.255 --> 01:23:34.255
Hello?

1499
01:23:34.256 --> 01:23:36.224
Hey, Britt, it's Scanlon.

1500
01:23:36.391 --> 01:23:39.360
Listen, I think I
owe you an apology.

1501
01:23:50.238 --> 01:23:53.730
Too much blood in the gutter.
You win. Let's split L.A.

1502
01:23:53.909 --> 01:23:57.242
You get the L. I get the A.
That means we share the gold

1503
01:23:57.412 --> 01:23:58.902
and the work.

1504
01:24:04.019 --> 01:24:06.817
One million dollars for today.

1505
01:24:07.022 --> 01:24:09.718
I think you misunderstood
where I was coming from

1506
01:24:09.891 --> 01:24:12.257
and I'd like a chance
to clarify some things.

1507
01:24:12.427 --> 01:24:13.627
Things are pretty clear.

1508
01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:15.279
I got three words for you:
Suck it, you dick face.

1509
01:24:15.564 --> 01:24:17.461
No, no, don't do that. Look.

1510
01:24:17.532 --> 01:24:20.057
Tell him that you wanna meet
him. This is journalism.

1511
01:24:20.235 --> 01:24:23.295
If you wanna be an investigative
reporter, you have to investigate.

1512
01:24:23.472 --> 01:24:25.064
Tell him that you wanna meet him.

1513
01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:28.266
Might've gotten disconnected,
Britt. You're right. Watch this.

1514
01:24:33.248 --> 01:24:34.248
I was joking.

1515
01:24:34.416 --> 01:24:37.078
Yeah, why don't we get together
and talk about things?

1516
01:24:37.252 --> 01:24:38.446
That's a good idea. Okay?

1517
01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.350
Let's meet for dinner. A little
place called Gonpachi Hibachi.

1518
01:24:41.523 --> 01:24:42.922
Little place on La Cienega.

1519
01:24:43.091 --> 01:24:44.490
Around 8:30?

1520
01:24:49.431 --> 01:24:51.565
La Cienega, 8:30.

1521
01:25:31.173 --> 01:25:32.173
Britt.

1522
01:25:43.318 --> 01:25:44.318
Hey, Frank.

1523
01:25:44.352 --> 01:25:45.352
Hey, Britt.

1524
01:25:45.387 --> 01:25:46.387
Good to see you.

1525
01:25:46.555 --> 01:25:48.318
I'm having a sake.
What are you having?

1526
01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:49.855
Yeah, I'll have some sake.

1527
01:25:52.427 --> 01:25:53.519
Thanks for coming.

1528
01:25:54.162 --> 01:25:55.464
No problem.

1529
01:26:27.896 --> 01:26:28.920
Mr Chudnofsky?

1530
01:26:29.097 --> 01:26:31.190
Bloodnofsky. Blood-nof-sky.

1531
01:26:31.366 --> 01:26:34.597
I commissioned the Green
Hornet. You're the chauffeur.

1532
01:26:35.437 --> 01:26:36.437
Partner.

1533
01:26:36.605 --> 01:26:37.799
Where's The Hornet?

1534
01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:39.940
Right there.

1535
01:26:42.577 --> 01:26:44.044
Whoa, we only get half the team?

1536
01:26:44.212 --> 01:26:45.611
Who says you're the good half?

1537
01:26:45.814 --> 01:26:46.814
Huh.

1538
01:26:50.952 --> 01:26:52.146
Where's Reid?

1539
01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.480
Guess.

1540
01:26:55.090 --> 01:26:56.250
Oh.

1541
01:26:56.424 --> 01:26:59.587
Any of you move, you're dead.

1542
01:27:00.428 --> 01:27:02.555
I'm not actually here
for forgiveness, Britt.

1543
01:27:02.731 --> 01:27:03.789
I don't understand.

1544
01:27:03.965 --> 01:27:05.398
You understand nothing,

1545
01:27:05.567 --> 01:27:07.728
so I'm gonna explain
it to you very simply.

1546
01:27:07.903 --> 01:27:11.270
If you ever come across any
article regarding a major crime,

1547
01:27:11.439 --> 01:27:13.100
a man named Benjamin Chudnofsky,

1548
01:27:13.275 --> 01:27:15.539
or anything that makes
this city think

1549
01:27:15.710 --> 01:27:18.838
I am not the fine line protecting
the light from the darkness,

1550
01:27:19.014 --> 01:27:20.481
you're gonna bring it to me.

1551
01:27:20.649 --> 01:27:22.048
You're gonna bring it to me

1552
01:27:22.217 --> 01:27:24.378
and I'll tell you if
it's okay to print

1553
01:27:24.553 --> 01:27:26.578
in your stupid little newspaper.

1554
01:27:28.223 --> 01:27:29.850
That's how I did it with your dad.

1555
01:27:30.725 --> 01:27:32.989
And that's how you and
I are gonna do it.

1556
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:38.729
Scanlon, are you saying you want
me to let you write the news?

1557
01:27:41.469 --> 01:27:44.632
Finally you understand.

1558
01:27:46.675 --> 01:27:49.473
Yup. I understand, all right.

1559
01:27:49.844 --> 01:27:51.004
Here's what I understand.

1560
01:27:51.446 --> 01:27:56.508
That you, son, just got
played by a player.

1561
01:27:56.851 --> 01:27:58.819
Recording device. USB.

1562
01:27:58.987 --> 01:28:00.511
No, you can't have it, it's mine.

1563
01:28:00.689 --> 01:28:02.589
You stupid schmuck.

1564
01:28:02.757 --> 01:28:04.247
I got you by the balls, Scanlon.

1565
01:28:04.426 --> 01:28:06.018
I own a newspaper, genius.

1566
01:28:06.194 --> 01:28:08.287
- This'll be front-page.
- I have to say

1567
01:28:08.463 --> 01:28:10.021
- I'm impressed.
- You should be.

1568
01:28:10.198 --> 01:28:11.358
It won't do you any good.

1569
01:28:11.533 --> 01:28:14.468
How could it not? Are you gonna
kill me in this restaurant?

1570
01:28:14.636 --> 01:28:15.636
Yes.

1571
01:28:15.971 --> 01:28:17.404
What, you're gonna murder me?

1572
01:28:17.572 --> 01:28:20.268
Yeah. Like I murdered your father.

1573
01:28:20.508 --> 01:28:24.035
I don't think so. My dad was not
murdered. He died of a bee sting.

1574
01:28:24.212 --> 01:28:26.874
No, no, your father died of
an overdose of apitoxin,

1575
01:28:27.048 --> 01:28:28.753
most commonly found
in a bee sting,

1576
01:28:28.754 --> 01:28:30.506
which he happened
to be allergic to.

1577
01:28:30.685 --> 01:28:35.145
But that apitoxin was
administered by me.

1578
01:28:37.292 --> 01:28:38.292
Shit.

1579
01:28:38.793 --> 01:28:42.320
Think, Britt. You can figure this
out, my son, with your brains.

1580
01:28:42.497 --> 01:28:45.091
It's almost like time slows down.

1581
01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:48.758
That's right. Think. Slowly.

1582
01:28:48.937 --> 01:28:51.701
Okay, two years ago, Scanlon
decides to run for DA.

1583
01:28:51.873 --> 01:28:54.205
He says he's cleaning
up the streets of L.A.,

1584
01:28:54.376 --> 01:28:55.900
which is impossible.

1585
01:28:56.077 --> 01:28:57.908
So he asked the media
to slant the news.

1586
01:28:58.079 --> 01:29:00.274
And you go along with
it like everybody else?

1587
01:29:00.448 --> 01:29:02.177
No way. I refused.

1588
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:05.183
So he... Shit. What does
he do? So Scanlon decides

1589
01:29:05.353 --> 01:29:06.377
to go really dirty.

1590
01:29:06.554 --> 01:29:09.387
Makes a pact with a criminal.
Chudnofsky kills your reporter.

1591
01:29:09.557 --> 01:29:10.717
Vertolibe? Vertoleeb?

1592
01:29:10.892 --> 01:29:13.793
I didn't want more bloodshed, so
I stopped reporting on crime.

1593
01:29:13.962 --> 01:29:15.759
To be honest, in the
last few years,

1594
01:29:15.930 --> 01:29:18.228
this paper has dipped in
quality and ambition.

1595
01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.425
Scanlon can hold up
his part of the deal,

1596
01:29:20.602 --> 01:29:22.092
keeping the media under control,

1597
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:23.999
and Chudnofsky does
whatever he wants.

1598
01:29:24.172 --> 01:29:25.230
To be honest...

1599
01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:28.208
But Chudnofsky had
a different plan.

1600
01:29:28.376 --> 01:29:31.038
He wanted to take over
all the gangs of L.A.

1601
01:29:31.212 --> 01:29:34.242
So that's when you decided
to cut the strings.

1602
01:29:34.649 --> 01:29:37.846
I couldn't look in the mirror. I
hated every word I said to you

1603
01:29:38.019 --> 01:29:39.077
that morning, Britt.

1604
01:29:39.921 --> 01:29:41.946
So you start reporting
on crime again.

1605
01:29:42.123 --> 01:29:43.681
And now Scanlon is a dead man

1606
01:29:43.858 --> 01:29:45.758
unless he proves he's
still in control.

1607
01:29:45.927 --> 01:29:49.095
He has no choice but to
organise a meeting with you,

1608
01:29:50.098 --> 01:29:51.429
and he kills you himself.

1609
01:29:52.967 --> 01:29:54.093
In the end,

1610
01:29:54.903 --> 01:29:56.768
you stood up for
what's right, Dad.

1611
01:29:57.372 --> 01:29:58.669
Now I have to do the same.

1612
01:30:03.011 --> 01:30:04.965
I can see by that
expression you've

1613
01:30:04.966 --> 01:30:06.811
had on your face for five minutes

1614
01:30:06.981 --> 01:30:09.541
that you're piecing this
together, but it's no good.

1615
01:30:09.718 --> 01:30:11.811
You're about to be killed
by the Green Hornet.

1616
01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:13.620
What?

1617
01:30:18.193 --> 01:30:20.957
The Green Hornet's
sidekick. He's got a gun.

1618
01:30:24.099 --> 01:30:25.099
Bluff. Bluff.

1619
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.762
Eradicate.

1620
01:30:30.171 --> 01:30:32.696
Before you do this, I want
you to know that I'm sorry.

1621
01:30:33.007 --> 01:30:34.941
I'm sorry for everything.

1622
01:30:35.844 --> 01:30:37.004
I forgive you.

1623
01:30:42.117 --> 01:30:43.641
Hey, not me. Him, stupid.

1624
01:30:43.818 --> 01:30:45.547
Confused? You should be.

1625
01:30:46.821 --> 01:30:47.821
Go, go.

1626
01:30:47.822 --> 01:30:48.914
Let's bail, Kato.

1627
01:30:49.791 --> 01:30:50.791
Back here.

1628
01:30:59.634 --> 01:31:01.124
We're cornered.

1629
01:31:01.736 --> 01:31:03.636
Know what happens when
you corner a hornet?

1630
01:31:03.805 --> 01:31:05.170
- No.
- You get stung.

1631
01:31:07.742 --> 01:31:08.742
Oh, Je...

1632
01:31:16.317 --> 01:31:17.317
See? Backups.

1633
01:31:20.522 --> 01:31:21.682
Go, go, go.

1634
01:31:26.661 --> 01:31:28.925
What the hell? He's supposed
to kill Britt Reid.

1635
01:31:29.097 --> 01:31:31.224
He's shooting at me.
Embark the vehicle.

1636
01:31:31.399 --> 01:31:32.764
Okay, okay, okay.

1637
01:31:43.077 --> 01:31:44.077
Are you okay?

1638
01:31:44.245 --> 01:31:45.735
Wait. Yeah, I'm fine.

1639
01:31:46.181 --> 01:31:47.239
My outfit's back here.

1640
01:31:50.919 --> 01:31:52.887
Britt Reid is the Green Hornet.

1641
01:31:53.054 --> 01:31:54.988
I know. You hired a
guy to kill himself.

1642
01:31:56.224 --> 01:31:57.350
Shut up.

1643
01:31:58.159 --> 01:32:00.855
Britt Reid recorded the
whole conversation

1644
01:32:01.029 --> 01:32:02.360
on some sushi drive USB.

1645
01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:03.861
We can't lose him.

1646
01:32:04.032 --> 01:32:05.966
We're not losing him,
we're following him.

1647
01:32:06.134 --> 01:32:07.134
Oh, Kato. Thank you.

1648
01:32:07.302 --> 01:32:09.600
- I need to hug you to thank you.
- What the hell?

1649
01:32:09.671 --> 01:32:10.704
Okay.

1650
01:32:10.705 --> 01:32:11.731
- To the house?
- No.

1651
01:32:11.906 --> 01:32:12.964
Here's the dilly yo.

1652
01:32:13.141 --> 01:32:14.802
We gotta get this to The Sentinel.

1653
01:32:14.976 --> 01:32:16.466
It's got Scanlon
spilling the beans.

1654
01:32:16.644 --> 01:32:18.407
We're gonna put it on the Net.

1655
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:20.343
It's what my father
would have wanted.

1656
01:32:20.515 --> 01:32:22.346
- You like your father now?
- Yes.

1657
01:32:22.517 --> 01:32:24.212
You see, he wasn't
a dick after all.

1658
01:32:24.385 --> 01:32:28.082
Well, he was a dick, just not
really how we thought he was.

1659
01:32:28.256 --> 01:32:29.518
At the end, he wasn't a di...

1660
01:32:29.691 --> 01:32:31.921
it's complicated. I'll
explain later, okay?

1661
01:32:32.093 --> 01:32:33.924
It's a lot of
conflicting emotions.

1662
01:32:34.095 --> 01:32:35.756
Let's roll, Britt.

1663
01:32:44.739 --> 01:32:46.104
Here's the thing, honestly.

1664
01:32:46.274 --> 01:32:48.199
I've been jealous of
you this entire time.

1665
01:32:48.276 --> 01:32:49.972
You're awesome. You
built this car.

1666
01:32:49.973 --> 01:32:51.044
Huh. I know.

1667
01:32:51.045 --> 01:32:52.421
You know karate. You're charming.

1668
01:32:52.423 --> 01:32:53.423
Thank you.

1669
01:32:53.448 --> 01:32:55.188
These guys are amazingly
well organised.

1670
01:32:57.485 --> 01:32:58.485
Hold on.

1671
01:33:00.822 --> 01:33:02.289
Yeah. Yeah.

1672
01:33:03.157 --> 01:33:04.488
Oh, yeah.

1673
01:33:10.164 --> 01:33:11.358
Burn them from the side.

1674
01:33:12.367 --> 01:33:13.367
Door guns.

1675
01:33:13.368 --> 01:33:14.368
What's a door gun?

1676
01:33:14.369 --> 01:33:15.369
Here.

1677
01:33:20.675 --> 01:33:21.972
The other side.

1678
01:33:23.611 --> 01:33:24.611
Your turn.

1679
01:33:30.385 --> 01:33:31.385
Oh, God.

1680
01:33:39.227 --> 01:33:40.227
Oh, shit.

1681
01:33:43.164 --> 01:33:44.222
We lost him.

1682
01:33:44.399 --> 01:33:46.390
He's gone. He's gone. Yeah.

1683
01:33:47.402 --> 01:33:48.994
Shit. He's back.

1684
01:33:49.170 --> 01:33:50.637
You gotta be kidding me.

1685
01:33:51.005 --> 01:33:52.029
These guys are good.

1686
01:33:53.308 --> 01:33:54.502
Over there, over there.

1687
01:33:54.976 --> 01:33:56.967
We're not gonna make it, dude.

1688
01:33:58.179 --> 01:33:59.305
We're not gonna make it.

1689
01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:00.880
Yeah, we're gonna make it.

1690
01:34:14.762 --> 01:34:16.354
That's a very big gun.

1691
01:34:29.177 --> 01:34:30.269
Kato, be careful.

1692
01:34:31.913 --> 01:34:32.913
Take the wheel.

1693
01:34:32.947 --> 01:34:33.947
What?

1694
01:34:33.948 --> 01:34:35.008
- Take the wheel.
- I can't.

1695
01:34:35.183 --> 01:34:36.183
Yes, you can.

1696
01:34:36.517 --> 01:34:38.144
Nunchucks? That was my idea.

1697
01:34:39.187 --> 01:34:40.187
Where are you going?

1698
01:34:47.261 --> 01:34:49.058
Are you okay? What are you doing?

1699
01:35:03.044 --> 01:35:04.044
Shit. Shit.

1700
01:35:04.078 --> 01:35:05.078
Kato.

1701
01:35:05.079 --> 01:35:06.079
Jesus.

1702
01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:07.447
I don't know what anything does.

1703
01:35:08.082 --> 01:35:09.482
Why didn't you do this in English?

1704
01:35:18.226 --> 01:35:19.784
- What are you saying?
- Closer.

1705
01:35:19.961 --> 01:35:20.961
Just jump in.

1706
01:35:21.129 --> 01:35:22.129
Turn the knob.

1707
01:35:22.296 --> 01:35:23.736
These guys are shooting at me.

1708
01:35:25.566 --> 01:35:27.158
Sorry. I'm sorry. Turn the knob.

1709
01:35:27.335 --> 01:35:28.666
- I don't know how.
- Calm down.

1710
01:35:28.836 --> 01:35:29.836
How do I stop it?

1711
01:35:30.405 --> 01:35:31.929
How do I stop it?

1712
01:35:33.341 --> 01:35:34.467
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1713
01:35:39.647 --> 01:35:40.978
- It's on fire.
- It's okay.

1714
01:35:41.616 --> 01:35:42.616
It's okay.

1715
01:35:42.617 --> 01:35:44.107
Next time, don't touch anything.

1716
01:35:47.488 --> 01:35:48.648
Kato. Look.

1717
01:35:48.856 --> 01:35:49.948
We made it.

1718
01:35:50.124 --> 01:35:51.682
- Kato, we made it.
- Hell, yeah.

1719
01:35:51.859 --> 01:35:52.859
Yeah.

1720
01:35:53.027 --> 01:35:54.654
I can't. Okay, that's cool.

1721
01:36:02.303 --> 01:36:03.736
Oh, we're screwed.

1722
01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:13.711
Yee-ha.

1723
01:36:25.359 --> 01:36:26.986
Come on, hurry. Hurry up.

1724
01:36:30.364 --> 01:36:31.364
Whoops.

1725
01:36:35.103 --> 01:36:37.104
- Did you drop it?
- Yes.

1726
01:36:37.105 --> 01:36:38.105
Shit.

1727
01:36:42.777 --> 01:36:44.267
Go get it. I'll cover you.

1728
01:36:45.113 --> 01:36:46.113
Wish me luck.

1729
01:36:47.315 --> 01:36:48.577
Good luck.

1730
01:37:11.339 --> 01:37:12.897
Dear Hornet,

1731
01:37:13.274 --> 01:37:17.477
be it my mask or your blood,
red will be the last...

1732
01:37:19.814 --> 01:37:21.042
it's Britt Reid.

1733
01:37:21.215 --> 01:37:22.477
There he is. Get him.

1734
01:37:23.217 --> 01:37:24.514
Don't let them go.

1735
01:37:24.685 --> 01:37:25.709
Come on.

1736
01:37:26.854 --> 01:37:28.287
Get him. Get him.

1737
01:37:31.893 --> 01:37:33.053
Let me shoot him.

1738
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:35.629
Oh, no.

1739
01:37:37.632 --> 01:37:38.997
Shoot to kill.

1740
01:37:41.035 --> 01:37:42.297
You brought a gas mask?

1741
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:43.937
Of course I brought a gas mask.

1742
01:37:44.105 --> 01:37:45.105
Just for yourself?

1743
01:37:49.443 --> 01:37:50.569
Where the?

1744
01:38:11.999 --> 01:38:12.999
There.

1745
01:38:17.538 --> 01:38:18.766
There. Behind the paper.

1746
01:38:26.047 --> 01:38:27.047
Over here.

1747
01:38:31.085 --> 01:38:33.986
The helmet, it fogs up everything.

1748
01:38:43.064 --> 01:38:44.395
There. There.

1749
01:38:44.565 --> 01:38:45.565
Shoot, shoot.

1750
01:38:51.205 --> 01:38:52.205
Kato.

1751
01:38:54.408 --> 01:38:55.898
Kato, save me.

1752
01:39:03.751 --> 01:39:05.719
Ha. I'm ungassable.

1753
01:39:13.527 --> 01:39:14.527
Move it.

1754
01:39:15.796 --> 01:39:16.796
Ow.

1755
01:39:21.435 --> 01:39:22.629
That was dangerous.

1756
01:39:24.605 --> 01:39:27.165
Drop me by the elevators,
I'll take it from here.

1757
01:39:32.346 --> 01:39:34.041
No, we stay together.

1758
01:39:40.755 --> 01:39:41.949
Get in the front seat.

1759
01:39:42.123 --> 01:39:43.123
- Quick.
- Quick.

1760
01:39:53.167 --> 01:39:54.935
- Tenth floor.
- Tenth floor.

1761
01:39:54.936 --> 01:39:55.936
What works?

1762
01:39:56.003 --> 01:39:57.527
- Missiles?
- Four missiles left.

1763
01:39:57.705 --> 01:39:58.797
Hornet gun?

1764
01:39:58.973 --> 01:40:00.133
- Check.
- Machine guns?

1765
01:40:00.308 --> 01:40:02.108
- Check.
- Does it drive?

1766
01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:03.911
Front-wheel drive.

1767
01:40:09.116 --> 01:40:10.116
Get out.

1768
01:40:10.117 --> 01:40:11.117
Get out of here.

1769
01:40:17.291 --> 01:40:18.519
You can let me out here.

1770
01:40:24.165 --> 01:40:25.165
Bazooka.

1771
01:40:25.166 --> 01:40:26.166
Guy with a bazooka.

1772
01:40:29.003 --> 01:40:30.003
Missile.

1773
01:40:30.504 --> 01:40:31.596
Fire.

1774
01:40:41.615 --> 01:40:42.615
Reload.

1775
01:40:47.154 --> 01:40:48.178
Kato, they're here.

1776
01:40:48.356 --> 01:40:49.550
Go be a journalist.

1777
01:40:49.724 --> 01:40:50.816
I'll kick ass.

1778
01:40:50.991 --> 01:40:51.991
There they are.

1779
01:40:52.093 --> 01:40:53.093
There.

1780
01:41:01.335 --> 01:41:02.335
Come on.

1781
01:41:09.243 --> 01:41:10.243
I'm there.

1782
01:41:10.244 --> 01:41:12.508
In one minute, this'll
be all over the world.

1783
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:16.750
Blue team, go.

1784
01:41:18.285 --> 01:41:19.285
Start up.

1785
01:41:22.923 --> 01:41:23.923
Shit.

1786
01:41:28.596 --> 01:41:29.596
Yeah.

1787
01:41:44.578 --> 01:41:45.578
There.

1788
01:42:08.202 --> 01:42:09.999
- Can you see him?
- I can't see him.

1789
01:42:13.007 --> 01:42:14.007
Oh.

1790
01:42:36.864 --> 01:42:39.094
Oh, I'm so stupid.

1791
01:42:49.543 --> 01:42:50.805
All right, Reid.

1792
01:42:51.345 --> 01:42:52.812
Hand over the thing.

1793
01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:53.980
You want it?

1794
01:42:54.782 --> 01:42:55.806
Go get it.

1795
01:43:00.688 --> 01:43:02.315
Where is it? Where is it?

1796
01:43:02.490 --> 01:43:03.821
I am Bloodnofsky.

1797
01:43:04.024 --> 01:43:06.686
I killed a thousand before and
I'll kill a thousand more.

1798
01:43:15.503 --> 01:43:17.266
Now tremble before your death.

1799
01:43:17.705 --> 01:43:20.299
For be it my mask,
or be it your blood,

1800
01:43:20.474 --> 01:43:23.409
red will be the last
colour you'll ever see.

1801
01:44:13.327 --> 01:44:14.327
Britt.

1802
01:44:14.395 --> 01:44:15.395
Britt.

1803
01:44:27.374 --> 01:44:28.374
Shit. Hey.

1804
01:44:28.676 --> 01:44:30.576
End of the road, Scanlon.

1805
01:44:30.744 --> 01:44:32.939
Okay, okay. Let's just calm down.

1806
01:44:33.113 --> 01:44:34.705
Hand over the sushi.

1807
01:44:34.882 --> 01:44:36.873
Oh... Yeah, hand it over.

1808
01:44:37.051 --> 01:44:38.051
We can talk about it.

1809
01:44:38.218 --> 01:44:40.018
- On the ground, now.
- Get down.

1810
01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:41.985
It's the Green Hornet. Shoot him.

1811
01:44:47.728 --> 01:44:48.786
Britt, quick.

1812
01:44:50.497 --> 01:44:52.158
I'm District Attorney
Frank Scanlon.

1813
01:44:52.366 --> 01:44:55.164
That is the Green
Hornet. Go shoot him.

1814
01:44:56.604 --> 01:44:57.969
Down on the ground.

1815
01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:01.767
Kato, I screwed up.

1816
01:45:01.942 --> 01:45:03.637
Scanlon's gonna get
away scot-free.

1817
01:45:04.511 --> 01:45:05.511
No, he's not.

1818
01:45:33.907 --> 01:45:35.431
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

1819
01:45:36.644 --> 01:45:38.441
- Ow.
- Oh.

1820
01:45:39.613 --> 01:45:41.342
- Ow.
- Whoa.

1821
01:45:44.952 --> 01:45:46.613
Holy shit.

1822
01:45:46.787 --> 01:45:48.482
Ejector seats.

1823
01:45:48.856 --> 01:45:50.050
You actually built them.

1824
01:45:50.224 --> 01:45:51.224
It was a good idea.

1825
01:45:55.663 --> 01:45:56.925
Wow.

1826
01:45:58.332 --> 01:46:00.562
This is really scary.

1827
01:46:01.535 --> 01:46:03.662
A high-speed chase
between the Green Hornet

1828
01:46:03.837 --> 01:46:06.635
and gang members has led to
The Daily Sentinel office...

1829
01:46:06.807 --> 01:46:08.240
Oh, my God. I called it.

1830
01:46:08.409 --> 01:46:11.310
Leaving a trail of demolished
cars and trucks in their path.

1831
01:46:11.478 --> 01:46:14.140
We're on our way to a
costume party. Okay?

1832
01:46:15.816 --> 01:46:17.477
We gotta get out of our suits.

1833
01:46:17.651 --> 01:46:19.744
Where the hell are we gonna go?

1834
01:46:21.321 --> 01:46:23.121
No one knows why the
district attorney...

1835
01:46:23.141 --> 01:46:24.520
Lenore.

1836
01:46:24.658 --> 01:46:25.658
No, no, no.

1837
01:46:27.261 --> 01:46:28.353
Lenore, stop. No, wait.

1838
01:46:28.529 --> 01:46:29.996
Stop. Lenore.

1839
01:46:30.064 --> 01:46:31.064
Lenore. Wait.

1840
01:46:31.131 --> 01:46:32.223
How do you know my name?

1841
01:46:32.399 --> 01:46:33.399
Kato.

1842
01:46:33.467 --> 01:46:35.367
- It's me.
- Ha. Oh, my God.

1843
01:46:35.536 --> 01:46:36.764
You assholes.

1844
01:46:37.438 --> 01:46:38.438
You assholes.

1845
01:46:38.439 --> 01:46:40.907
What the hell are you doing?
You guys are criminals.

1846
01:46:41.075 --> 01:46:42.736
You're criminals. Oh, my God.

1847
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:45.105
Stop. We're helping people.

1848
01:46:45.279 --> 01:46:47.645
Why ask me to do research
on the Green Hornet

1849
01:46:47.815 --> 01:46:49.339
when you are the Green Hornet?

1850
01:46:49.516 --> 01:46:52.576
We don't know what we're doing.
We needed you. Don't you see?

1851
01:46:52.753 --> 01:46:54.084
- You're the mastermind.
- What?

1852
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:56.629
This is the police. Open up.

1853
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:59.054
Please don't screw us. We were
trying to be good people.

1854
01:46:59.226 --> 01:47:00.523
Think about it.

1855
01:47:02.029 --> 01:47:03.963
Hello, officer, can I help you?

1856
01:47:04.131 --> 01:47:06.326
We're looking for two
masked men. Seen anything?

1857
01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:07.797
Yeah, of course.

1858
01:47:07.901 --> 01:47:08.901
Really?

1859
01:47:08.969 --> 01:47:10.937
They're all over the
news all the time.

1860
01:47:11.572 --> 01:47:14.564
All right. Well, please
report anything suspicious.

1861
01:47:14.742 --> 01:47:15.742
Absolutely.

1862
01:47:17.244 --> 01:47:19.712
You guys are such stupid assholes.

1863
01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:22.576
- What are you thinking?
- Please forgive us. Forgive me.

1864
01:47:23.050 --> 01:47:24.915
- Are you crazy?
- Kiss and make up later.

1865
01:47:25.085 --> 01:47:26.211
I don't kiss him.

1866
01:47:26.386 --> 01:47:27.580
I got a bullet in me.

1867
01:47:27.755 --> 01:47:30.781
You and I don't kiss. You guys
might kiss, but I don't kiss you.

1868
01:47:32.159 --> 01:47:34.059
I've been shot in the shoulder.

1869
01:47:34.228 --> 01:47:35.752
Well, then go to the hospital.

1870
01:47:35.929 --> 01:47:38.659
No. Don't you see? The police
know the Green Hornet was

1871
01:47:38.832 --> 01:47:39.992
shot in the shoulder.

1872
01:47:40.167 --> 01:47:43.136
If I go to the hospital, they'll
know I'm the Green Hornet.

1873
01:47:43.303 --> 01:47:44.634
Yeah, you've been shot. Ew.

1874
01:47:44.805 --> 01:47:46.085
- Here's what I need.
- What?

1875
01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:48.265
Get me a spatula to
bite and a knife.

1876
01:47:48.442 --> 01:47:51.639
You gotta dig this bullet
out of my meat. Do it.

1877
01:47:51.979 --> 01:47:53.173
I'm cold.

1878
01:47:55.115 --> 01:47:56.480
It's deep inside me.

1879
01:47:56.784 --> 01:47:58.615
Oh, God. Spatula.

1880
01:47:59.353 --> 01:48:01.253
Okay, okay. Wait.

1881
01:48:01.421 --> 01:48:02.581
- Sterilise it.
- What?

1882
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:03.848
Sterilise it.

1883
01:48:04.024 --> 01:48:05.423
I don't wanna get gangrene.

1884
01:48:05.592 --> 01:48:06.650
Say it, say it.

1885
01:48:06.827 --> 01:48:07.827
- Shon-di.
- Shon-di.

1886
01:48:07.961 --> 01:48:09.019
Shon-di forever.

1887
01:48:09.196 --> 01:48:11.664
- Here we go, this is hot.
- Let me see. Just wait.

1888
01:48:11.832 --> 01:48:13.629
I'm not ready. Stop, stop, stop.

1889
01:48:13.967 --> 01:48:15.457
Wait, it hurts.

1890
01:48:15.636 --> 01:48:17.763
Okay, I can't do it.
Take me to the hospital.

1891
01:48:17.938 --> 01:48:19.030
Would you just shut up?

1892
01:48:19.206 --> 01:48:22.652
Okay, look, if I'm the
mastermind of this, just

1893
01:48:22.653 --> 01:48:24.172
let me have a second of silence

1894
01:48:24.344 --> 01:48:26.835
so I can figure this out. Okay?

1895
01:48:27.281 --> 01:48:28.646
Mere hours ago,

1896
01:48:28.816 --> 01:48:31.614
the Green Hornet and a group
of his criminal underlings

1897
01:48:31.785 --> 01:48:34.845
launched a horrendous
attack on this building

1898
01:48:35.022 --> 01:48:38.583
that claimed the life of
District Attorney Frank Scanlon.

1899
01:48:38.792 --> 01:48:42.352
It's unfortunate, but, you
know, that's what happens.

1900
01:48:43.163 --> 01:48:45.358
The Daily Sentinel
will be rebuilt.

1901
01:48:45.966 --> 01:48:47.524
And to start that off,

1902
01:48:47.701 --> 01:48:50.795
I am naming Mike Axford
the new editor in chief.

1903
01:48:52.472 --> 01:48:54.804
Mike's great and he's
comfortable telling me off,

1904
01:48:54.975 --> 01:48:57.307
so he's the perfect
man for the job.

1905
01:48:58.679 --> 01:49:01.239
We have to get this paper
back to the ideals

1906
01:49:01.415 --> 01:49:03.975
that my father started it on.

1907
01:49:05.619 --> 01:49:08.588
I wanna make him
proud, and I hope to

1908
01:49:08.755 --> 01:49:12.885
make this city proud of The Daily
Sentinel like never before.

1909
01:49:17.631 --> 01:49:19.724
The Green Hornet
sends his regards.

1910
01:49:24.171 --> 01:49:26.332
He shot me.

1911
01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:27.837
Directly in the shoulder.

1912
01:49:28.942 --> 01:49:31.022
The Green Hornet's
sidekick shot Britt Reid.

1913
01:49:31.411 --> 01:49:32.708
Get me to the hospital.

1914
01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:34.400
He's been shot in the shoulder.

1915
01:49:34.548 --> 01:49:36.846
We gotta get him to a
hospital right away.

1916
01:49:38.752 --> 01:49:40.811
It worked. Ow.

1917
01:50:17.190 --> 01:50:18.190
Kato.

1918
01:50:18.191 --> 01:50:19.215
Kato.

1919
01:50:19.493 --> 01:50:20.493
Hey.

1920
01:50:20.494 --> 01:50:22.621
We have a secret
mission. Everything

1921
01:50:22.796 --> 01:50:25.230
we've done up till now is
complete and utter crap.

1922
01:50:25.399 --> 01:50:27.060
This is all that matters.

1923
01:50:27.234 --> 01:50:29.134
This is it.

1924
01:50:29.603 --> 01:50:30.968
Let's roll, Kato.

1925
01:50:38.812 --> 01:50:40.211
It's crooked.

1926
01:50:40.847 --> 01:50:42.144
He's kind of...

1927
01:50:42.482 --> 01:50:44.143
He's kind of looking...

1928
01:50:44.618 --> 01:50:45.618
Down?

1929
01:50:45.786 --> 01:50:47.014
Ah, it's fine.

1930
01:50:47.254 --> 01:50:48.653
Doesn't matter.

1931
01:50:49.356 --> 01:50:50.516
We did it.

1932
01:50:51.425 --> 01:50:52.483
We did.

1933
01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:54.987
The Green Hornet.

1934
01:50:55.162 --> 01:50:58.654
His reliable partner,
the Blue Wombat.

1935
01:51:00.367 --> 01:51:01.629
Oh, man.

1936
01:51:02.002 --> 01:51:06.234
Okay, how about the
Red Hippopotamus?

1937
01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:08.673
