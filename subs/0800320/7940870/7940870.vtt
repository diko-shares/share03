[SCREAMS]

1141
01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:12.270
I'm a god.

1142
01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:14.150
I will live forever.

1143
01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.780
But not here.

ANDROMEDA:

1145
01:32:41.530 --> 01:32:44.030
The boats are coming for us.

1146
01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:50.410
For you. Not for me.

1147
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:53.500
You won't stay, will you?

1148
01:32:55.170 --> 01:32:57.040
Perseus, Argos needs a ruler.

1149
01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.250
I cannot be a king.

1150
01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:02.090
I serve you better as a man.

1151
01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:05.800
You'll make a fine queen for them.

1152

ZEUS:

1153
01:33:45.810 --> 01:33:48.600
Olympus owes you a debt of gratitude.

1154
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:51.900
As do I.

1155
01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:53.690
Hades lives.

1156
01:33:54.150 --> 01:33:56.440
He's just sent back to the underworld.

1157
01:33:56.610 --> 01:33:58.570
Biding his time, no doubt.

1158
01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:02.450
Waiting for men to grow weak,

1159
01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:02.450
and in their weakness, he grows stronger.

1160
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.580
It's mankind who holds the key

1161
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.580
to Hades' rise.

1162
01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:06.790
It always was.

1163
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:09.330
So we'll see him again.

1164
01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.210
Yes.

1165
01:34:11.370 --> 01:34:14.170
But now the world knows

1166
01:34:11.370 --> 01:34:14.170
a man can stop him.

1167
01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:17.800
Of course, you had some help.

1168
01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:21.130
A sword, the Pegasus....

1169
01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:26.760
I wanted men to worship us again,

1170
01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:26.760
but I didn't want it to cost me a son.

1171
01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:30.310
That's almost human of you.

1172
01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:34.270
I don't suppose you'll reconsider my offer

1173
01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:34.270
to take your place as one of us.

1174
01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:41.280
I've got everything I need right here.

1175
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:43.950
You may not want to be a god, Perseus...

1176
01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:47.660
...but after feats like yours,

1177
01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:47.660
men will worship you.

1178
01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.910
Be good to them.

1179
01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.420
Be better than we were.

And if you insist on continuing

1181
01:34:54.670 --> 01:34:58.000
this mundane human existence...

1182
01:34:58.170 --> 01:34:59.960
...I won't have you do it alone.
