<font color=#ff8000><i>The Titans were powerful</i></font>

5
00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:51.484
<font color=#ff8000><i>but their reign was

9
00:00:58.527 --> 00:01:00.582
<font color=#ff8000><i>Zeus convinced his brother Hades,</i></font>

10
00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:04.588
<font color=#ff8000><i>to create a beast so strong
it could defeat their parents.</i></font>

11
00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:06.758
<font color=#ff8000><i>And from his own flesh,</i></font>

12
00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:10.622
<font color=#ff8000><i>Hades gave birth
to an unspeakable horror.</i></font>

13
00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:12.630
<font color=#ff8000><i>The Kraken.</i></font>

14
00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.918
<font color=#ff8000><i>Zeus became king of the heavens.</i></font>

15
00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:27.095
<font color=#ff8000><i>Poseidon, king of the seas.</i></font>

16
00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:31.340
<font color=#ff8000><i>And Hades, tricked by Zeus,</i></font>

17
00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.514
<font color=#ff8000><i>Was left to rule the underworld</i></font>

18
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.013
<font color=#ff8000><i>in darkness and in misery.</i></font>

19
00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.368
<font color=#ff8000><i>It was Zeus who created man,</i></font>

20
00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.811
<font color=#ff8000><i>And man's prayers fed the gods' immortality.</i></font>

21
00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:50.147
<font color=#ff8000><i>But in time,</i></font>

22
00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.119
<font color=#ff8000><i>mankind grew restless.</i></font>

23
00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:55.155
<font color=#ff8000><i>They began to question the gods</i></font>

24
00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:56.721
<font color=#ff8000><i>And finally,</i></font>

25
00:01:56.902 --> 00:01:58.664
<font color=#ff8000><i>rise up against them.</i></font>

26
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.621
<font color=#ff8000><i>Into this world, a child was born.</i></font>

27
00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:13.140
<font color=#ff8000><i>A boy who would change everything.</i></font>

28
00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:51.404
Perseus.

29
00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:24.617
What is it, son?

30
00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.040
I'll have a brother or a sister soon.

31
00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.452
Think we're gonna love this child
differently to the way we love you?

32
00:03:33.522 --> 00:03:34.444
We won't.

33
00:03:35.678 --> 00:03:37.290
This child will be yours.

34
00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:38.739
Me

35
00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:41.386
I'm no one's son.

36
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.682
I am your father, Perseus.

37
00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.106
Marmara is your mother.

38
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.680
And you'll always,

39
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:48.287
be our son.

40
00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:51.054
The bond between us,

41
00:03:51.768 --> 00:03:53.858
is much more than flesh and bone.

42
00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:55.826
The love we have for you,

43
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.580
it's that love,

44
00:03:57.963 --> 00:04:00.196
that gods and kings fight over.

45
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.364
I've never understood the gods.

46
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:06.536
But even I don't question
that you were saved for a reason.

47
00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:08.470
And some day,

48
00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.458
That reason...

49
00:04:11.225 --> 00:04:13.323
is gonna take you far away from here.

50
00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:16.838
But not tonight?

51
00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.987
Perseus. Perseus!

52
00:04:40.274 --> 00:04:41.602
Getting frail, old man.

53
00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.538
Marmara!

54
00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:44.809
Marmara!

55
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.905
Another day,

56
00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:52.387
nothing.

57
00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:55.128
Caught on the reef.

58
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.786
To whom do I direct our gratitude
for this glorious bounty?

59
00:04:59.817 --> 00:05:01.208
Spyros, please.

60
00:05:01.253 --> 00:05:02.982
Poseidon, Zeus?

61
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:04.507
Who do I thank, Marmara?

62
00:05:04.524 --> 00:05:06.068
Thank the men who provoke them.

63
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.537
They crush my island.

64
00:05:08.054 --> 00:05:09.725
They put a plague on yours.

65
00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:11.693
They take from us what they want.

66
00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:12.967
We're their slaves.

67
00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:14.181
The gods gave us life.

68
00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:15.920
For that, we should be thankful.

69
00:05:15.922 --> 00:05:18.603
I'm tired of being thankful for scraps.

70
00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:21.528
I'm a fisherman.
Perseus is a fisherman.

71
00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:23.290
They've even taken that away from us.

72
00:05:24.234 --> 00:05:25.280
What we are?

73
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:27.451
Still they want us to love them anyway.

74
00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:29.482
One day,

75
00:05:29.884 --> 00:05:31.720
somebody's gonna have
to make a stand.

76
00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.329
One day,

77
00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:36.290
somebody's gonna
have to say, enough.

78
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.749
Just like the day you came to me.

79
00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:16.157
The storm brought me right to you.

80
00:06:22.451 --> 00:06:24.077
I know you have questions, son.

81
00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.281
I wish I had the answers.

82
00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.256
I have everything I need.

83
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.132
Right here.

84
00:06:38.938 --> 00:06:40.135
Good night, son.

85
00:06:58.543 --> 00:06:59.940
Hold her steady!

86
00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:02.331
Tekla, the wreath.

87
00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:03.868
Fetch the wreath.

88
00:07:04.334 --> 00:07:05.867
The statue of Zeus.

89
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.624
Magnificent.

90
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.357
Something isn't right.

91
00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:24.819
The soldiers,

92
00:07:25.055 --> 00:07:26.429
what are they doing?

93
00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:31.783
Come on!

94
00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.493
Lift it!

95
00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.433
Hang on!

96
00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:46.464
In the name of the king and queen!

97
00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:48.633
Who are they?

98
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.719
Soldiers from Argos.

99
00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:52.757
What have they done?

100
00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.077
They've declared war.

101
00:07:55.234 --> 00:07:56.903
War against the gods.

102
00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.300
Let's turn the boat around.

103
00:08:20.302 --> 00:08:21.041
No.

104
00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.001
Do nothing.

105
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.953
Behind you!

106
00:08:51.822 --> 00:08:52.763
Hold on!

107
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:00.698
Tekla.

108
00:09:01.282 --> 00:09:02.407
Where's the boy?

109
00:09:08.463 --> 00:09:09.392
Tekla!

110
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.126
Go!

111
00:09:41.128 --> 00:09:41.998
No!

112
00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:05.821
No!

113
00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.967
Zeus, you must bring an end to this.

114
00:10:11.969 --> 00:10:13.387
They attack our temples!

115
00:10:13.722 --> 00:10:16.509
Now they dare to desecrate Zeus' image.

116
00:10:16.511 --> 00:10:17.598
We could reach out to them.

117
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.429
An accommodation could be made.
A truce!

118
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.976
No!

119
00:10:25.707 --> 00:10:26.971
I created them

120
00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.909
And they reward my love with...

121
00:10:30.281 --> 00:10:31.327
defiance?

122
00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:33.472
There will be no truce.

123
00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:35.994
Finally.

124
00:10:36.633 --> 00:10:38.592
Some rage from you.

125
00:10:42.537 --> 00:10:43.912
How long has it been?

126
00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:46.301
How long brother,

127
00:10:46.607 --> 00:10:48.814
since you've seen my face?

128
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.441
Hades.

129
00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:59.975
Endless years,

130
00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:02.544
I've watched from the underworld

131
00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.655
And saw your wrath,

132
00:11:06.377 --> 00:11:08.751
tempered with love.

133
00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.580
You created them for one reason, so...

134
00:11:12.248 --> 00:11:16.298
their prayers would fuel our immortality.

135
00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:19.174
But you love them too well.

136
00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:21.179
They've grown strong.

137
00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.940
And now I am forced to rise,

138
00:11:24.325 --> 00:11:26.680
because we are all threatened.

139
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.376
What do you want, brother?

140
00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:30.915
Let me loose upon them.

141
00:11:32.441 --> 00:11:34.239
They will pray again.

142
00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:37.786
And you will bathe
in their awe and fear.

143
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.199
And we will grow strong again.

144
00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.618
He belongs in the underworld, not here.

145
00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:46.287
You do not tell me where I belong.

146
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.866
You say it is love that feeds us.

147
00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:54.585
But you depend on their love.

148
00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:58.400
I've only learned to live on their fear

149
00:11:59.468 --> 00:12:00.531
Their pain.

150
00:12:01.178 --> 00:12:02.132
Zeus,

151
00:12:02.652 --> 00:12:04.079
our brother speaks the truth.

152
00:12:04.753 --> 00:12:05.643
Hear him.

153
00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:12.595
Go.

154
00:12:13.943 --> 00:12:14.727
Do what you will.

155
00:12:14.729 --> 00:12:16.181
Father, we need the mortals.

156
00:12:16.183 --> 00:12:17.329
No, Apollo.

157
00:12:17.566 --> 00:12:18.767
Hades is right.

158
00:12:19.484 --> 00:12:21.555
Their insolence has a price.

159
00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:23.052
Like children,

160
00:12:23.232 --> 00:12:25.351
they need to be reminded
of the order of things.

161
00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.844
Set an example, brother.

162
00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:30.017
Turn them on each other

163
00:12:31.273 --> 00:12:32.841
And back into our arms.

164
00:13:14.969 --> 00:13:17.221
Are we the last boat to come in?
No, captain.

165
00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:19.431
You're the only one.

166
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.327
Is he one of ours?

167
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.386
No, we found him off Paxos
amongst our dead.

168
00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:27.055
He was the only survivor.

169
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.279
Let the palace figure out
what to do with him.

170
00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:31.968
Squad by four!

171
00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:34.548
Go on.

172
00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:38.233
Because if we show the gods our love,

173
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.693
They shall show us love in return.
They shall.

174
00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:43.527
They gave us the corn in the fields,
the sun in the sky.

175
00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:45.057
These are all gifts given to us.

176
00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:47.711
Gifts can be taken away.
This will be taken away,

177
00:13:47.713 --> 00:13:49.547
If we do not pay love to our gods.

178
00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:53.716
If we do not, we stay in filth and misery,
which we have brought upon ourselves.

179
00:13:53.718 --> 00:13:55.394
Move.
Our gods, we beg for the whip

180
00:13:55.396 --> 00:13:56.351
Out of the way.

181
00:13:56.406 --> 00:13:58.631
The beauty and clarity of servitude.

182
00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:01.216
Man cannot rule man.

183
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:03.475
You defy the gods
and you will be punished.

184
00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:44.716
Is this all there is?

185
00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:47.498
We lost many men, Your Majesty

186
00:14:47.899 --> 00:14:49.399
But we have victory.

187
00:14:52.106 --> 00:14:53.685
To King Kepheus!

188
00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:55.479
To Queen Cassiopeia!

189
00:14:59.523 --> 00:15:00.257
No.

190
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.631
To you.

191
00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.032
Our mighty legion.

192
00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.267
Our heroes,

193
00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:13.954
who have dared to strike
a blow at the heart of Zeus!

194
00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:18.442
The temples are burning.

195
00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:20.855
The statues have fallen.

196
00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:24.220
We have starved them of our prayers.

197
00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:25.386
Tonight

198
00:15:25.924 --> 00:15:28.079
After a generation of struggle,

199
00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:30.674
The sun does not set over the ocean.

200
00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.986
It sets on Olympus itself.

201
00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:37.231
A new era has begun.

202
00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:39.953
The era of man!

203
00:15:42.554 --> 00:15:44.288
That frown doesn't suit you, Andromeda.

204
00:15:44.351 --> 00:15:46.434
Have something to drink.
You'll feel more lively.

205
00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:51.754
Andromeda.

206
00:16:02.614 --> 00:16:03.656
What's your name?

207
00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:05.588
Perseus.

208
00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:08.537
Take this.

209
00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:10.722
Please drink.

210
00:16:15.031 --> 00:16:15.864
Hands off.

211
00:16:15.866 --> 00:16:16.892
Enough.

212
00:16:17.191 --> 00:16:18.974
Our daughter, the missionary.

213
00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:23.974
Have you seen
what's happening out there?

214
00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:26.912
Have you even bothered to look?

215
00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.246
We serve as an inspiration.

216
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:32.390
Hundreds of our men
have lost their lives,

217
00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:34.651
yet we celebrate.

218
00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:38.996
You provoke the gods and you act
as if there will be no consequence.

219
00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.362
Well, what do you want?

220
00:16:40.364 --> 00:16:42.226
Should we be afraid?
Should we be...

221
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.033
trembling and soiling
ourselves in fear?

222
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.213
The gods need us.

223
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:48.758
They need our worship.

224
00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:51.884
What do we need of them?

225
00:16:52.167 --> 00:16:53.467
Look at my daughter.

226
00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:54.779
Don't.

227
00:16:54.955 --> 00:16:56.878
What could be more divine,

228
00:16:56.911 --> 00:16:58.095
than her face?

229
00:16:58.182 --> 00:17:00.461
More beautiful than
all the women of Greece.

230
00:17:00.463 --> 00:17:02.809
More beautiful than Aphrodite herself.

231
00:17:03.075 --> 00:17:05.595
The Olympians should envy her.

232
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.733
We are the gods now.

233
00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.386
My queen.
You're making a spectacle.

234
00:17:55.405 --> 00:17:56.613
Interesting.

235
00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:58.105
You!

236
00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:19.508
You are specks of dust,

237
00:18:19.736 --> 00:18:21.507
beneath our fingernails.

238
00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:24.602
Your very breath is a gift from Olympus.

239
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.340
You have insulted powers
beyond your comprehension.

240
00:18:29.024 --> 00:18:30.050
Who are you?

241
00:18:31.026 --> 00:18:33.579
I am Hades.

242
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:38.853
Kneel.

243
00:18:46.997 --> 00:18:48.368
Not now, Perseus.

244
00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:50.539
You will have your chance.

245
00:18:56.545 --> 00:18:58.592
What do you know of beauty?

246
00:18:59.572 --> 00:19:02.077
What is more beautiful than death?

247
00:19:07.273 --> 00:19:09.577
Gaze upon me, mortal queen.

248
00:19:19.908 --> 00:19:21.492
Mother.
Princess.

249
00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.586
In 10 days

250
00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:32.388
When the sun is eclipsed

251
00:19:34.396 --> 00:19:36.897
I will unleash the Kraken.

252
00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:40.357
Argos will be swept from the earth,

253
00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:42.808
and all of you with it.

254
00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:46.613
Unless...

255
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.062
you sacrifice the princess.

256
00:19:50.151 --> 00:19:52.896
You so foolishly compare to the gods.

257
00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:56.220
Only her blood will sate the Kraken,

258
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.119
and Zeus,

259
00:19:58.995 --> 00:20:01.886
who you have so offended.

260
00:20:05.954 --> 00:20:08.539
Choose your penance, Argos.

261
00:20:08.612 --> 00:20:11.626
Destruction or sacrifice.

262
00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:14.092
This is the will of Zeus.

263
00:20:14.796 --> 00:20:18.518
The will of your father.

264
00:20:32.342 --> 00:20:34.504
There is a demigod in Argos.

265
00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:38.437
That is impossible.

266
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:41.026
He's yours.

267
00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:44.051
His name is Perseus.

268
00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:47.278
We could offer him sanctuary.

269
00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:50.207
Have I heard his prayers?

270
00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:53.515
This son knows no love for me.

271
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.033
He's no different from any of the others
who have turned their backs on us.

272
00:20:58.505 --> 00:21:00.830
For the last time demigod,

273
00:21:00.832 --> 00:21:01.839
speak!

274
00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:03.956
I'm not a demigod.

275
00:21:04.251 --> 00:21:05.538
Who are you?

276
00:21:05.818 --> 00:21:06.907
Why were you sent?

277
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.239
I don't know.

278
00:21:16.524 --> 00:21:17.899
I advise against this, sire.

279
00:21:17.901 --> 00:21:19.726
He's not to be trusted.
What would you have me do?

280
00:21:19.899 --> 00:21:20.690
Draco.

281
00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:25.396
Leave him.

282
00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:31.840
Is it possible?

283
00:21:32.874 --> 00:21:34.854
If it's true you are the son of Zeus.

284
00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:37.033
You can save us.

285
00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:41.757
You must save us.

286
00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:43.649
I can't save you.
I'm just a man.

287
00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:45.464
My lord,

288
00:21:45.466 --> 00:21:47.717
as terrible as it is to utter the words.

289
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.220
A sacrifice is the only way.

290
00:21:50.423 --> 00:21:52.018
Don't even say the word.

291
00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:53.316
He's right.

292
00:21:54.396 --> 00:21:55.998
No one should have to die for me.

293
00:21:57.816 --> 00:21:58.991
Let Perseus go.

294
00:22:00.193 --> 00:22:00.984
Sire,

295
00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.273
we need to get the princess
out of the city now.

296
00:22:04.072 --> 00:22:05.420
I'll find a place to hide her.

297
00:22:05.507 --> 00:22:06.993
You can't hide from Hades.

298
00:22:07.075 --> 00:22:09.254
So says the bastard son of a god.

299
00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:15.568
My father,

300
00:22:17.052 --> 00:22:18.754
was killed by a god.

301
00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:20.934
My mother,

302
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.979
sister.

303
00:22:24.092 --> 00:22:27.259
Everyone I loved was killed, by a god.

304
00:22:28.805 --> 00:22:30.138
I mend nets.

305
00:22:30.848 --> 00:22:32.298
Not wield a sword.

306
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.487
So, demigod, you have a visitor.

307
00:22:45.906 --> 00:22:47.445
She says she knows you.

308
00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:53.273
My name is lo, Perseus.

309
00:22:54.998 --> 00:22:56.332
And how do you know me?

310
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.742
I've watched you all your life.

311
00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:01.058
I guided you to your family.

312
00:23:05.258 --> 00:23:06.467
Are you a god?

313
00:23:06.751 --> 00:23:08.418
There are gods and there are men.

314
00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:11.172
And there are those of us
who are in between.

315
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.432
Many years ago,

316
00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:15.354
I refused,

317
00:23:15.356 --> 00:23:16.780
a god's advance.

318
00:23:17.395 --> 00:23:19.396
I was cursed with agelessness.

319
00:23:20.148 --> 00:23:21.528
That's not much of a curse.

320
00:23:22.275 --> 00:23:24.690
I've lived for years watching
my loved ones die.

321
00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:28.572
I imagine you're sympathetic
to that plight.

322
00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:34.526
Is it true?

323
00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:38.915
Am I the son of Zeus?

324
00:23:40.168 --> 00:23:41.210
Yes.

325
00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:47.341
The story of your birth began with
the rebellion of King Acrisius.

326
00:23:49.734 --> 00:23:51.630
Mankind had grown tired,

327
00:23:51.632 --> 00:23:54.038
of the gods' mistreatment and cruelty.

328
00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:58.369
Acrisius led a siege on Olympus.

329
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:05.132
It is said the other gods wanted to simply
lay waste to Acrisius and his army.

330
00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:08.320
But Zeus loved man too much.

331
00:24:08.488 --> 00:24:09.802
Instead,

332
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:13.028
he chose to make
an example of Acrisius.

333
00:24:14.695 --> 00:24:17.445
He disguised himself as the king.

334
00:24:17.784 --> 00:24:19.551
And visited the chamber,

335
00:24:19.636 --> 00:24:21.583
where the king's wife was sleeping.

336
00:24:21.686 --> 00:24:22.727
My king.

337
00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:33.319
Zeus?

338
00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:42.377
Acrisius grew mad with rage.

339
00:24:43.273 --> 00:24:45.927
He ordered the execution of his wife,

340
00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.304
and Zeus' newborn son.

341
00:24:55.368 --> 00:24:56.785
I curse you, Zeus.

342
00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:59.288
I deny you the body you soiled.

343
00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:01.539
And the bastard child with it!

344
00:25:05.045 --> 00:25:06.754
No!

345
00:25:20.267 --> 00:25:22.683
The queen and her child
were cast into the sea.

346
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.544
Your mother was killed but you,

347
00:25:26.095 --> 00:25:28.443
part man, part god, you lived.

348
00:25:29.469 --> 00:25:31.188
I've watched over you ever since.

349
00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:35.324
Waiting for the day, when you will help
bring an end to the tyranny of the gods.

350
00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:36.708
You were born,

351
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.054
to kill the Kraken.

352
00:25:40.942 --> 00:25:42.859
I don't know why I was born

353
00:25:44.793 --> 00:25:46.253
Or what I am.

354
00:25:48.672 --> 00:25:50.714
But I know it's not the Kraken
I wanna kill.

355
00:25:51.508 --> 00:25:53.167
How do I get to Hades?

356
00:25:53.593 --> 00:25:55.636
If the Kraken falls,

357
00:25:55.804 --> 00:25:57.440
Hades will be weak enough,

358
00:25:57.442 --> 00:25:59.474
for you to strike a deathly blow.

359
00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:02.303
Only then will you have
the revenge you seek.

360
00:26:02.696 --> 00:26:04.384
Then they better release me.

361
00:26:08.866 --> 00:26:10.253
If the Kraken can be killed,

362
00:26:10.255 --> 00:26:11.733
The Stygian witches will know how.

363
00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:15.347
The witches are further away
than the legion has ever been.

364
00:26:15.865 --> 00:26:16.991
No man can go there.

365
00:26:17.158 --> 00:26:18.211
No man.

366
00:26:21.538 --> 00:26:22.935
Keep your distance, lo.

367
00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:27.069
Zeus,

368
00:26:27.602 --> 00:26:29.594
forgive us for these
affronts and protect us.

369
00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:33.407
And you still believe
they're going to help?

370
00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:36.552
This is suicide.

371
00:26:36.594 --> 00:26:38.929
And the shields.
Come on, boys.

372
00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:40.693
It's a lost cause.

373
00:26:41.308 --> 00:26:42.581
We've no chance,

374
00:26:42.583 --> 00:26:43.935
and you know it.

375
00:26:44.462 --> 00:26:46.355
Here's who you drew into this, Perseus.

376
00:26:46.849 --> 00:26:48.150
An honor guard.

377
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.242
Young men who look good
on a reviewing stand.

378
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:54.176
And old soldiers,

379
00:26:54.324 --> 00:26:55.889
heading towards retirement.

380
00:26:57.198 --> 00:26:58.706
Do you know what the Kraken is?

381
00:27:00.702 --> 00:27:02.320
The Kraken is the end of us.

382
00:27:02.786 --> 00:27:04.873
A colossal, elemental beast.

383
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.764
It doesn't think.
It doesn't feel.

384
00:27:07.007 --> 00:27:08.158
Even the gods fear it.

385
00:27:08.201 --> 00:27:09.045
And you,

386
00:27:09.884 --> 00:27:11.807
you're going to kill it?
Don't come.

387
00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:14.269
I don't need your help.

388
00:27:14.513 --> 00:27:15.553
Of course not.

389
00:27:17.218 --> 00:27:18.637
You're the son of Zeus.

390
00:27:19.742 --> 00:27:21.108
But we have orders.

391
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.279
Gentlemen,

392
00:27:23.324 --> 00:27:24.582
may our journey be long,

393
00:27:24.584 --> 00:27:26.856
filled with agony and torment.

394
00:27:27.268 --> 00:27:29.598
And may we all complain about it
bitterly as old men.

395
00:27:30.273 --> 00:27:31.458
So what should we bring?

396
00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.644
Bring everything.

397
00:27:37.937 --> 00:27:40.115
What makes you think the witches
will tell us anything?

398
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.644
Oh, they'll tell us, or I'll kill them too.

399
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.313
Come on.
Let's go, boys.

400
00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:52.927
What is this?

401
00:27:52.929 --> 00:27:54.068
Just leave it.

402
00:27:58.593 --> 00:28:01.135
Don't leave us
to the mercy of the gods!

403
00:28:01.662 --> 00:28:02.428
Please.

404
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.571
Don't go.
Please stay!

405
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.020
Stay here.
Please! Please! Help us.

406
00:28:11.868 --> 00:28:14.128
You're just going
to make the gods angrier.

407
00:28:14.216 --> 00:28:16.203
Please stay back!
Just sacrifice the princess!

408
00:28:17.278 --> 00:28:19.203
Watch your mouth! Stay back.

409
00:28:19.405 --> 00:28:20.305
Stay back!

410
00:28:20.448 --> 00:28:22.074
You'd think they might be thankful.

411
00:28:23.076 --> 00:28:24.326
You cannot desert us!

412
00:28:24.712 --> 00:28:26.291
Maybe they're tired of being thankful.

413
00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:28.778
Good news!

414
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:33.339
My brother and I have decided,
to accompany you on your journey.

415
00:28:33.735 --> 00:28:35.154
We have enough strangers here.

416
00:28:35.187 --> 00:28:37.391
We can be of great help to you,
trust me.

417
00:28:37.603 --> 00:28:38.343
You'll need us.

418
00:28:38.345 --> 00:28:40.202
I need soldiers, not hunters.

419
00:28:41.469 --> 00:28:42.969
Which one of your soldiers,

420
00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:46.408
knows how to cut the impenetrable
skin of the Nemean lion?

421
00:28:46.766 --> 00:28:48.032
Which one of them knows

422
00:28:48.034 --> 00:28:50.725
the soft points on a centaur's armor?

423
00:28:51.058 --> 00:28:52.420
Which one of them knows

424
00:28:52.422 --> 00:28:55.458
which jugular to slice
on a five-headed Hydra?

425
00:28:57.193 --> 00:28:58.895
The middle one.
The middle one?

426
00:28:59.062 --> 00:29:00.058
Good guess.

427
00:29:00.169 --> 00:29:02.054
My brother and I, we know how to kill.

428
00:29:02.613 --> 00:29:03.779
We enjoy it.

429
00:29:03.782 --> 00:29:06.410
If you can keep up and you
don't mind dying come along.

430
00:29:07.454 --> 00:29:09.760
It is death who should be
afraid of us.

431
00:29:57.391 --> 00:29:58.605
King Acrisius.

432
00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:01.405
There is no Acrisius.

433
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.973
Just Calibos.

434
00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:14.645
We have an enemy in common.

435
00:30:15.522 --> 00:30:17.369
Zeus.
Zeus.

436
00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:22.505
My brother.

437
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.115
What do you want from me?

438
00:30:27.283 --> 00:30:30.790
Zeus' seed in your wife survived.

439
00:30:31.955 --> 00:30:33.709
The child of your shame.

440
00:30:35.708 --> 00:30:36.800
Perseus.

441
00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.646
He lives?

442
00:30:39.546 --> 00:30:42.047
You murdered your wife for nothing.

443
00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:43.511
Now,

444
00:30:43.513 --> 00:30:47.543
Perseus hurls himself
from Argos to destroy me.

445
00:30:48.763 --> 00:30:50.165
He must die.

446
00:30:50.901 --> 00:30:52.380
What would you have me do?

447
00:30:52.382 --> 00:30:55.994
Zeus must think I serve him but...

448
00:30:56.393 --> 00:30:58.189
I am growing stronger.

449
00:30:58.815 --> 00:31:01.601
Until I possess my full power.

450
00:31:04.112 --> 00:31:04.927
You...

451
00:31:05.557 --> 00:31:07.389
will be my weapon.

452
00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:10.634
Come.

453
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.621
Use this.

454
00:31:43.818 --> 00:31:46.012
Kill Perseus for me.

455
00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:50.705
And I'll destroy Zeus for you.

456
00:31:51.301 --> 00:31:52.505
I serve you.

457
00:31:53.369 --> 00:31:54.990
The boy will die.

458
00:32:00.668 --> 00:32:01.739
How far is it?

459
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:04.253
Four days to the witches.

460
00:32:04.797 --> 00:32:05.982
Four days?

461
00:32:05.984 --> 00:32:07.535
I'm tired already.

462
00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:12.298
Here,

463
00:32:12.729 --> 00:32:13.695
use this.

464
00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:19.834
Would you like us to wait?

465
00:33:19.747 --> 00:33:21.151
You really are a fisherman.

466
00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:22.823
You should have seen my father.

467
00:33:23.918 --> 00:33:24.691
You.

468
00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:27.093
Bring your weapon.

469
00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.891
Have you handled a sword before?

470
00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:40.344
There's been no need.

471
00:33:40.439 --> 00:33:41.111
I see.

472
00:33:41.978 --> 00:33:43.173
Left foot forward.

473
00:33:47.275 --> 00:33:48.514
Your motions

474
00:33:48.917 --> 00:33:50.448
should be fluid.

475
00:33:51.404 --> 00:33:52.934
The weapon is a part of you.

476
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:57.303
Like the sting on a wasp.

477
00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:01.476
Stay focused.

478
00:34:02.344 --> 00:34:03.469
Know what's around you.

479
00:34:06.252 --> 00:34:08.276
Keep your balance at all times.

480
00:34:08.796 --> 00:34:09.734
You fall

481
00:34:11.966 --> 00:34:13.017
You die.

482
00:34:17.764 --> 00:34:18.580
Get up.

483
00:34:24.979 --> 00:34:25.892
Don't

484
00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:46.514
There is a god in you.

485
00:34:47.502 --> 00:34:48.810
Be sure to bring it.

486
00:34:51.506 --> 00:34:52.704
End of lesson.

487
00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:16.558
Perseus.

488
00:36:19.552 --> 00:36:20.969
A gift from the gods.

489
00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:23.848
Forged on Olympus.
Why?

490
00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:26.266
Just accept it.

491
00:36:28.936 --> 00:36:30.395
I can do this as a man.

492
00:36:33.575 --> 00:36:34.617
So it's yours.

493
00:36:45.161 --> 00:36:46.131
Gentlemen,

494
00:36:46.133 --> 00:36:47.955
retrieve our savior.

495
00:37:48.182 --> 00:37:49.453
The Pegasus.

496
00:37:52.228 --> 00:37:53.853
No man has ever ridden one.

497
00:38:00.194 --> 00:38:01.479
It's a message.

498
00:38:02.488 --> 00:38:03.813
They're watching us.

499
00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:22.665
Perseus!

500
00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.161
Perseus!

501
00:38:28.043 --> 00:38:29.085
Perseus!

502
00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.200
Why does it always have to be?

503
00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:34.607
Listen.

504
00:38:43.696 --> 00:38:44.807
Help me!

505
00:38:46.907 --> 00:38:47.962
Help me!

506
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:54.542
You reek of your father.

507
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:02.348
Who was that?

508
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:03.379
I don't know.

509
00:40:03.975 --> 00:40:05.116
Let's ask him.

510
00:40:48.953 --> 00:40:49.931
Let it go.

511
00:40:51.557 --> 00:40:52.599
No.
We split up.

512
00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:54.680
Just follow the blood.

513
00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:07.854
Come on!

514
00:41:13.223 --> 00:41:14.079
Look!

515
00:41:14.512 --> 00:41:15.502
His blood.

516
00:41:40.959 --> 00:41:42.072
Are you happy now?

517
00:41:44.418 --> 00:41:45.525
Attack!

518
00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:56.205
Wait! Wait!

519
00:42:00.356 --> 00:42:01.644
What is that?

520
00:43:39.408 --> 00:43:40.072
Come on!

521
00:43:43.078 --> 00:43:44.120
Lxas!

522
00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:46.504
Spear!

523
00:44:07.065 --> 00:44:08.016
Draco!

524
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.323
Faster!

525
00:44:33.462 --> 00:44:34.653
Let's go, let's go!

526
00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:36.607
Go, jump!

527
00:45:10.082 --> 00:45:12.333
Run!

528
00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:13.323
Back up!

529
00:45:13.325 --> 00:45:14.795
Back up! Back up! Back up!

530
00:45:14.899 --> 00:45:16.897
Run!
Everyone. Back to back!

531
00:45:30.607 --> 00:45:31.575
Stand your ground.

532
00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:38.972
Three more!

533
00:45:39.337 --> 00:45:41.095
In the name of the gods, they're bigger.

534
00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:02.344
What are they?

535
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.638
Djinn.

536
00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:09.283
I fought them,

537
00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:10.828
in the legion.

538
00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:12.349
This is their desert.

539
00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:14.815
Enemies?

540
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.398
I thought so.

541
00:46:16.565 --> 00:46:17.661
They aren't human.

542
00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:20.615
Not anymore.
Desert conjurers, cutthroats.

543
00:46:20.617 --> 00:46:21.795
Well, somebody should thank them.

544
00:46:21.816 --> 00:46:22.561
What?

545
00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:47.119
What is it?

546
00:46:47.121 --> 00:46:48.852
Venom. From Hades.

547
00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:52.527
Pray.

548
00:46:52.529 --> 00:46:54.335
Pray to Zeus for strength. No.

549
00:46:54.741 --> 00:46:55.647
No.

550
00:46:55.812 --> 00:46:57.605
Pray to your damn father.

551
00:46:57.898 --> 00:47:00.066
Hear my prayer.
Protect and heal your son.

552
00:47:00.234 --> 00:47:00.930
No.

553
00:47:01.065 --> 00:47:02.160
Please, Zeus hear me.

554
00:47:12.287 --> 00:47:13.763
Would you like some bread?

555
00:47:14.763 --> 00:47:16.001
Thank you.
Thank you.

556
00:47:16.523 --> 00:47:17.731
Please.
Have some bread.

557
00:47:17.751 --> 00:47:19.293
Over here. Over here.

558
00:47:19.461 --> 00:47:21.194
For you.
Please.

559
00:47:31.168 --> 00:47:31.983
No.

560
00:47:33.475 --> 00:47:36.602
We must turn our hearts to Hades!

561
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.736
It is the only way!

562
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.390
Brothers and sisters!

563
00:47:44.152 --> 00:47:45.238
Come to me!

564
00:47:45.708 --> 00:47:46.771
Come!

565
00:47:50.032 --> 00:47:52.980
I have the way out, of our misery.

566
00:47:53.328 --> 00:47:56.000
Hades has asked for the princess.

567
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:58.325
Sacrifice one,

568
00:47:58.911 --> 00:48:00.627
for the life of the city.

569
00:48:03.463 --> 00:48:06.103
Why do they remain silent
while we suffer?

570
00:48:06.384 --> 00:48:09.540
Why do they guard the woman
whose death will save us?

571
00:48:10.095 --> 00:48:12.096
Is she better than any one of you?

572
00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:15.485
We have long worshiped Zeus in Argos.

573
00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:17.446
But it is Hades,

574
00:48:17.844 --> 00:48:20.042
who now offers us salvation.

575
00:48:20.639 --> 00:48:22.318
We must pray to the one,

576
00:48:22.595 --> 00:48:24.392
who showed us our sin,

577
00:48:24.864 --> 00:48:27.027
and who offers us redemption,

578
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:29.312
through blood.

579
00:48:45.047 --> 00:48:46.413
A bribe for the ferryman.

580
00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:57.391
When they get injured in battle,

581
00:48:57.851 --> 00:49:00.959
they replace their limbs
with charwood and black magic.

582
00:49:03.746 --> 00:49:04.986
They feel no pain.

583
00:49:05.567 --> 00:49:06.920
Live hundreds of years.

584
00:49:07.527 --> 00:49:08.888
So how old is that one?

585
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.317
I don't care.

586
00:49:15.155 --> 00:49:16.261
I don't trust them.

587
00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:26.789
You're burning.

588
00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:32.401
Drink this.

589
00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:40.670
I'll get more water.

590
00:50:18.935 --> 00:50:19.939
Come on!

591
00:50:24.674 --> 00:50:25.640
Look out!

592
00:50:36.162 --> 00:50:36.928
What?

593
00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:39.657
What's he saying?

594
00:50:41.149 --> 00:50:43.953
The Djinn have waited many years for
the one who will free them from the gods.

595
00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:47.282
He says he is no friend of the humans.

596
00:50:47.284 --> 00:50:48.290
You don't say.

597
00:50:50.372 --> 00:50:52.504
The only way we can help Perseus
is together.

598
00:50:59.992 --> 00:51:00.940
Draco.

599
00:51:02.184 --> 00:51:03.095
Look.

600
00:51:13.153 --> 00:51:14.064
Together.

601
00:51:32.506 --> 00:51:33.779
He's not ready to travel yet.

602
00:51:33.781 --> 00:51:35.008
Time is slipping away, lo.

603
00:51:35.175 --> 00:51:36.913
He may be a demigod,
but he's still mortal.

604
00:51:36.915 --> 00:51:37.969
Feeling better?

605
00:51:38.027 --> 00:51:39.060
Yeah, a bit.
Good.

606
00:51:41.811 --> 00:51:43.562
Your pride is killing my men.

607
00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:45.336
You were given gifts. Use them.

608
00:51:45.338 --> 00:51:46.424
Those gifts are a trap!

609
00:51:46.426 --> 00:51:48.087
I don't care what they are.
Use them.

610
00:51:48.268 --> 00:51:48.954
No!

611
00:51:49.231 --> 00:51:50.707
I will not use that sword

612
00:51:50.709 --> 00:51:52.103
or anything that they give me!

613
00:51:52.178 --> 00:51:53.881
So we'll just continue to die.

614
00:52:02.369 --> 00:52:03.721
I can't become like them.

615
00:52:07.415 --> 00:52:08.553
If I do this,

616
00:52:09.437 --> 00:52:10.679
I do it as a man.

617
00:52:12.543 --> 00:52:15.041
But you are not just a man.

618
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.389
I choose to be.

619
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:21.174
A man cannot do this, Perseus.

620
00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:23.296
According to who?

621
00:52:23.682 --> 00:52:24.662
The gods?

622
00:52:37.794 --> 00:52:39.477
If I had your gifts

623
00:52:41.366 --> 00:52:43.533
when you need your sword,
it's in my bag.

624
00:52:55.171 --> 00:52:56.213
They're riding them.

625
00:53:12.113 --> 00:53:14.364
They tried to kill us.
I'm not getting on it.

626
00:53:16.335 --> 00:53:17.691
Magnificent.

627
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.790
What are you waiting for?

628
00:53:20.947 --> 00:53:23.616
Well, we need to make up for lost time.

629
00:53:57.228 --> 00:53:58.616
We're making good time.

630
00:53:59.152 --> 00:54:00.343
Not good enough.

631
00:54:00.595 --> 00:54:02.322
The eclipse is drawing near.

632
00:54:02.989 --> 00:54:05.040
How close are we
to the Norn Mountains?

633
00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:08.364
It'll be two days before
we reach the witches.

634
00:54:14.396 --> 00:54:16.147
This thing is making me feel sick.

635
00:54:16.503 --> 00:54:18.629
Trust me, it's better to be
on one than in one.

636
00:54:26.452 --> 00:54:27.814
What, don't you ever smile?

637
00:54:28.473 --> 00:54:30.643
When I spit in the eyes of the gods

638
00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:33.756
then I'll smile.

639
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.795
What is this place?

640
00:55:15.304 --> 00:55:16.521
The Garden of Stygia.

641
00:55:18.314 --> 00:55:20.315
This is where the Kraken
defeated the Titans.

642
00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:23.349
It's what Argos will look
like when we fail.

643
00:55:24.696 --> 00:55:26.697
Every step we take
is an insult to the gods.

644
00:55:26.865 --> 00:55:27.443
Good.

645
00:55:27.445 --> 00:55:28.343
Perseus.

646
00:55:30.076 --> 00:55:32.057
Only ask what you need to know.

647
00:55:32.715 --> 00:55:33.982
Nothing more.

648
00:55:35.081 --> 00:55:36.048
Of course.

649
00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.665
Visitors.

650
00:56:18.833 --> 00:56:20.292
Who is it?
Visitors.

651
00:56:20.728 --> 00:56:22.892
Got the eye.
Give it to me.

652
00:56:23.245 --> 00:56:24.350
Who is it?

653
00:56:28.322 --> 00:56:29.807
Who is it? Who is it?

654
00:56:32.318 --> 00:56:33.860
The eye.
Give it to me.

655
00:56:34.106 --> 00:56:35.398
Perseus, no.

656
00:56:36.395 --> 00:56:37.812
We didn't come here to fight.

657
00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:41.855
We just have one question.
Young Perseus.

658
00:56:42.023 --> 00:56:44.316
Son of Zeus.
So fresh.

659
00:56:44.484 --> 00:56:45.749
Perseus.
Closer.

660
00:56:45.763 --> 00:56:46.847
A little nibble.

661
00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:50.489
Flesh of a god.
Flesh of a god.

662
00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:51.744
Witch.

663
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.850
Don't. Easy.

664
00:56:55.954 --> 00:56:57.405
Stale meat, ladies.

665
00:57:02.827 --> 00:57:04.994
So which one's gonna
answer my question?

666
00:57:05.296 --> 00:57:08.010
You want to know about the Kraken.
Kraken?

667
00:57:08.111 --> 00:57:09.320
Do it.
Kill it.

668
00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:11.677
That's right.
A wasted journey.

669
00:57:11.845 --> 00:57:13.720
The Kraken fears no weapon.

670
00:57:14.514 --> 00:57:15.722
It must have a weakness.

671
00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:18.308
Maybe.

672
00:57:19.352 --> 00:57:21.096
But knowledge demands payment.

673
00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:23.355
Sacrifice.
Sacrifice.

674
00:57:23.523 --> 00:57:24.648
Eusebios!
Watch out!

675
00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:27.574
Look out!

676
00:57:28.013 --> 00:57:29.258
Lxas, shoot!

677
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:34.952
Help!
The eye!

678
00:57:39.998 --> 00:57:41.765
Let him go!
No!

679
00:57:41.991 --> 00:57:43.901
Do it!
You would not dare.

680
00:57:45.253 --> 00:57:47.170
We cannot see the answers
without the eye!

681
00:57:47.228 --> 00:57:48.353
Let him go!

682
00:57:50.425 --> 00:57:51.882
Now answer the question.

683
00:57:53.224 --> 00:57:54.886
How do we kill the Kraken?

684
00:57:56.221 --> 00:57:57.847
There is a solution.
Solution.

685
00:57:58.061 --> 00:57:59.461
But it is an impossible one.

686
00:57:59.463 --> 00:58:01.784
Yeah?
The Gorgon, Medusa.

687
00:58:01.895 --> 00:58:03.395
Medusa.

688
00:58:03.563 --> 00:58:07.038
Anything of flesh is killed by her gaze.

689
00:58:07.055 --> 00:58:10.891
Killed by her.
Her prison lies across the River Styx,

690
00:58:10.904 --> 00:58:14.136
At the edge of the underworld.
A Titan against a Titan.

691
00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:17.032
She's no use against the Kraken.
We can't control her.

692
00:58:18.578 --> 00:58:19.870
Then we take her head.

693
00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:21.646
Clever boy.

694
00:58:21.648 --> 00:58:24.000
Now the eye. Give us the eye.

695
00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.786
The eye.
The eye.

696
00:58:30.673 --> 00:58:31.798
Where is it?

697
00:58:36.336 --> 00:58:38.049
But wait. There's more.

698
00:58:38.527 --> 00:58:40.117
Don't you want to know more?

699
00:58:40.119 --> 00:58:41.370
Perseus, no.

700
00:58:42.477 --> 00:58:44.227
Tell him.
Tell him.

701
00:58:44.395 --> 00:58:45.266
What?

702
00:58:45.306 --> 00:58:47.552
Your journey does not end well.

703
00:58:49.233 --> 00:58:51.109
Fate has spoken.

704
00:58:54.428 --> 00:58:57.939
You will die, son of Zeus!

705
00:59:00.244 --> 00:59:01.945
It's a lie.
Come.

706
00:59:02.538 --> 00:59:03.789
Written as history.

707
00:59:06.774 --> 00:59:08.084
Perseus.

708
00:59:08.197 --> 00:59:10.191
You will die.

709
00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:32.234
Why are the Djinn leaving us?

710
00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:33.985
They believe we will all die.

711
00:59:33.987 --> 00:59:35.363
It's the prophecy.

712
00:59:57.468 --> 00:59:58.510
Who are you?

713
01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:07.847
Well,

714
01:00:08.518 --> 01:00:10.613
you can call me, Father.

715
01:00:12.233 --> 01:00:13.142
If you wish.

716
01:00:13.624 --> 01:00:14.845
My father's dead.

717
01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:16.862
He was killed by a god.

718
01:00:17.321 --> 01:00:20.198
An unfortunate casualty
in a war men brought on themselves.

719
01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.423
Men didn't murder my family.

720
01:00:23.189 --> 01:00:24.452
Your brother did.

721
01:00:25.538 --> 01:00:27.205
You heard the witches' prophesy.

722
01:00:27.373 --> 01:00:28.645
You will not defeat the Kraken,

723
01:00:28.647 --> 01:00:29.876
much less Hades.

724
01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:32.109
If you continue this
journey, you will die,

725
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.213
and Argos will still fall.

726
01:00:34.599 --> 01:00:36.213
If you're so sure, why are you here?

727
01:00:36.215 --> 01:00:38.190
To offer you sanctuary.

728
01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.483
Your blood is mine, Perseus,

729
01:00:40.485 --> 01:00:41.971
and that makes you a god.

730
01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:44.839
It's time you came to Olympus
and started living like one.

731
01:00:45.106 --> 01:00:48.066
Rather die in the mud with those men
than live forever as a god.

732
01:00:48.102 --> 01:00:49.478
You foolish boy.

733
01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:52.854
Man's entire existence
is a gift of my grace.

734
01:00:52.963 --> 01:00:54.525
For someone who created man,

735
01:00:54.527 --> 01:00:56.096
you don't know much about us.

736
01:00:57.445 --> 01:00:58.541
We live.

737
01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:01.837
We fight and we die

738
01:01:02.343 --> 01:01:03.475
For each other,

739
01:01:03.985 --> 01:01:05.066
not for you.

740
01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:08.580
Tell Hades I'll see him soon.

741
01:01:09.874 --> 01:01:11.593
I will not make this offer again.

742
01:01:11.783 --> 01:01:12.533
Good.

743
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:14.751
Because I'd hate
to refuse you twice.

744
01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:16.133
Perseus.

745
01:01:17.453 --> 01:01:18.114
Wait.

746
01:01:25.598 --> 01:01:27.490
It's expensive where you're going.

747
01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:54.668
Kucuk fashioned this shield
from the Scorpioch.

748
01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:58.773
Stronger and lighter than any metal.

749
01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.383
Very rare and high-quality item.

750
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:07.556
We can fight anywhere

751
01:02:09.715 --> 01:02:11.312
But not in the underworld.

752
01:02:13.312 --> 01:02:14.223
Yeah.

753
01:02:19.443 --> 01:02:20.588
Good luck, fisherman.

754
01:02:35.668 --> 01:02:37.426
We all heard what the witches said.

755
01:02:38.963 --> 01:02:40.436
But we can prove them wrong.

756
01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:44.039
I need your help.

757
01:02:55.354 --> 01:02:57.230
It wasn't the gods
that saved me up there.

758
01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:01.684
If you believe
that we have a chance.

759
01:03:06.073 --> 01:03:07.669
I never liked Argos much anyway.

760
01:03:13.539 --> 01:03:14.738
I know the way.

761
01:03:20.171 --> 01:03:21.702
Then we go to the underworld.

762
01:03:22.149 --> 01:03:23.528
We kill Medusa.

763
01:04:13.474 --> 01:04:14.612
Now what?

764
01:04:15.038 --> 01:04:16.493
We wait for Charon.

765
01:04:18.312 --> 01:04:20.047
Charon only ferries the dead.

766
01:04:21.065 --> 01:04:22.054
Any volunteers?

767
01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:33.994
Heads we swim.

768
01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:01.294
A bribe for the ferryman.

769
01:05:57.965 --> 01:05:59.491
So, what happens when we get there?

770
01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:01.581
Just another beast to kill.

771
01:06:02.374 --> 01:06:03.513
A beast?

772
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:06.522
Medusa was beautiful once.

773
01:06:07.509 --> 01:06:10.344
So beautiful as to tempt Poseidon.

774
01:06:10.632 --> 01:06:12.314
When he came for her

775
01:06:12.843 --> 01:06:17.055
She ran to Athena's temple thinking
that the goddess would protect her.

776
01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:18.878
She didn't.

777
01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:22.769
Poseidon took her on the cold floor.

778
01:06:23.617 --> 01:06:25.994
She prayed to Athena for comfort,

779
01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:28.483
But the goddess felt nothing
but disgust.

780
01:06:28.877 --> 01:06:31.705
She made sure no one would ever
want Medusa again.

781
01:06:32.874 --> 01:06:37.143
One look at the creature she has become
will turn any living thing to stone.

782
01:06:37.576 --> 01:06:39.182
I cannot assist you there.

783
01:06:39.768 --> 01:06:41.365
A curse prevents me.

784
01:06:42.414 --> 01:06:46.716
It was Athena's one bit of solace to Medusa
so that Medusa would never harm a woman.

785
01:06:47.586 --> 01:06:49.947
Only men are allowed in the temple.

786
01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:53.294
Though no man has ever made it out.

787
01:07:27.668 --> 01:07:30.279
Medusa's got a tail
and that's how she'll use it.

788
01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:32.848
Listen.

789
01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.505
Hear her muscles coil.

790
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:39.293
Smell her skin.

791
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:42.971
Feel her hunger in your gut.

792
01:07:44.664 --> 01:07:46.164
Medusa's killed you twice now.

793
01:07:47.354 --> 01:07:49.089
Do you think she'll hand you her head?

794
01:07:49.294 --> 01:07:51.113
She won't be gracious about it.

795
01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:54.846
One look in her eyes
and you'll turn to stone.

796
01:07:57.656 --> 01:07:58.490
Good.

797
01:08:02.953 --> 01:08:04.535
Try not to enjoy this so much.

798
01:08:04.537 --> 01:08:06.234
I'm trying to help you live.

799
01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:09.667
Don't look at me.

800
01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:31.609
Ease your storm.

801
01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:42.784
We're nearing Medusa's lair.

802
01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:01.245
I never thought
I could reach this place.

803
01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:05.515
Who'd you lose?

804
01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:13.388
My daughter.

805
01:09:16.068 --> 01:09:18.695
Taken away on her 16th birthday.

806
01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:21.371
Dragged down here.

807
01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.501
I have a feeling I'll see her soon.

808
01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.371
You brought us this far.

809
01:09:30.716 --> 01:09:32.254
Let's go the rest of the way.

810
01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:55.000
How many coins did you get, Perseus?
Just the one.

811
01:10:21.216 --> 01:10:23.103
I only knew one great man in my life.

812
01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:27.278
My father.

813
01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:32.110
Now I know four more.

814
01:10:35.814 --> 01:10:36.989
And a woman.

815
01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.319
And whatever the hell you are.

816
01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:47.559
I know we're all afraid.

817
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.852
But my father told me.

818
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:51.113
Someday,

819
01:10:51.275 --> 01:10:53.082
someone was gonna have
to take a stand.

820
01:10:53.454 --> 01:10:54.396
Someday,

821
01:10:55.149 --> 01:10:56.872
someone was gonna have
to say enough.

822
01:10:59.671 --> 01:11:00.880
This could be that day.

823
01:11:03.059 --> 01:11:04.301
Trust your senses.

824
01:11:04.885 --> 01:11:06.693
And don't look this bitch in the eye.

825
01:11:38.168 --> 01:11:40.170
That doesn't really
inspire confidence.

826
01:11:40.293 --> 01:11:41.072
Quiet.

827
01:11:42.172 --> 01:11:43.979
Listen.
Eusebios.

828
01:11:44.591 --> 01:11:45.773
Keep your eyes down.

829
01:12:08.699 --> 01:12:10.288
Here we go.

830
01:12:20.627 --> 01:12:21.733
Solon!

831
01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:28.709
Keep going!

832
01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:31.693
Flank her.

833
01:12:36.291 --> 01:12:37.361
Draco.

834
01:12:37.927 --> 01:12:38.960
Go!

835
01:12:40.074 --> 01:12:41.533
Eusebios, follow me.

836
01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:48.154
Hang on!

837
01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:22.728
Eusebios.

838
01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:27.490
Remember what Perseus said.

839
01:13:34.477 --> 01:13:35.519
Eyes down.

840
01:13:50.842 --> 01:13:51.931
Lxas, no.

841
01:13:59.017 --> 01:14:00.100
Eyes down.

842
01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:07.119
Where are you?

843
01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:21.438
Eusebios.

844
01:14:28.338 --> 01:14:29.303
Go!

845
01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:45.368
Wait here.

846
01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:48.899
I'll lure her out.

847
01:14:50.193 --> 01:14:51.310
Get ready.

848
01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.138
Now!

849
01:15:56.973 --> 01:16:00.346
We die together.

850
01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:44.341
Let them know men did this.

851
01:18:10.435 --> 01:18:12.707
Just you and me, son of Zeus.

852
01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:23.476
Perseus.

853
01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:26.433
Don't become one of them.

854
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.543
Io, I'm here.

855
01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:47.993
There's no time.

856
01:19:51.536 --> 01:19:52.623
The eclipse.

857
01:19:54.497 --> 01:19:56.903
Perseus, you must go
before it's too late.

858
01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:04.061
I'm not going anywhere.

859
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:07.042
My fate is certain.

860
01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:10.372
But the fate of Argos
is still in your hands.

861
01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:13.838
All my life you've been there.

862
01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.856
You never left me.

863
01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:19.980
I can't leave you.

864
01:20:21.775 --> 01:20:24.026
This part of the journey
you must do alone.

865
01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:26.051
Perseus

866
01:20:26.441 --> 01:20:28.918
You're not just part man, part god.

867
01:20:31.117 --> 01:20:32.732
You're the best of both.

868
01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:40.659
Everything will be alright.

869
01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:38.157
Brother.

870
01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:42.364
It is time for the mortals to pay.

871
01:21:45.316 --> 01:21:47.827
My child waits to do your will.

872
01:21:58.204 --> 01:21:59.497
Leave us.

873
01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:08.647
Release the Kraken!

874
01:22:36.868 --> 01:22:39.276
The Kraken comes now!

875
01:22:40.413 --> 01:22:42.218
Our suffering ends,

876
01:22:42.849 --> 01:22:44.751
when the beast is sated!

877
01:22:45.335 --> 01:22:46.701
Will it take us.

878
01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:51.450
Or will it take Andromeda?

879
01:22:51.665 --> 01:22:53.750
Andromeda!

880
01:22:56.721 --> 01:22:58.472
It's my name they're calling.

881
01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:01.892
This cannot continue.

882
01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.446
Stay back!
Stay back!

883
01:23:44.477 --> 01:23:47.229
Look! The Kraken!
Help us!

884
01:24:14.257 --> 01:24:16.341
Andromeda!

885
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.907
Hades, we sacrifice our princess,

886
01:24:22.003 --> 01:24:23.083
in your name.

887
01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:32.649
It comes, brothers and sisters!

888
01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:05.224
Argos has fallen.

889
01:25:06.309 --> 01:25:08.344
Do you feel stronger, brother?

890
01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:12.356
You thought the Kraken
would bring you their prayers.

891
01:25:12.857 --> 01:25:14.932
But the Kraken is my child.

892
01:25:15.284 --> 01:25:17.111
It feeds only me.

893
01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:18.861
I command Olympus.

894
01:25:19.386 --> 01:25:21.047
Remember who you serve.

895
01:25:21.217 --> 01:25:23.186
I serve myself.

896
01:25:23.743 --> 01:25:26.257
I have since you cheated me.

897
01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:30.332
You sent me to the underworld
to be hated,

898
01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.743
while you basked in their love.

899
01:25:33.711 --> 01:25:35.254
We need the love of humans.

900
01:25:35.421 --> 01:25:37.193
No, you need it.

901
01:25:37.584 --> 01:25:39.209
I survive on their fear.

902
01:25:39.717 --> 01:25:41.711
Your reign is over, brother Zeus.

903
01:25:42.053 --> 01:25:46.181
You'll watch while my blessed
avenger devours their hopes.

904
01:25:46.349 --> 01:25:49.393
And then finally you'll know my pain.

905
01:25:49.936 --> 01:25:52.767
There is still a demigod in Argos,

906
01:25:53.471 --> 01:25:54.577
brother.

907
01:25:59.854 --> 01:26:00.896
Perseus.

908
01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:35.883
The bag!
Come on!

909
01:28:07.031 --> 01:28:09.475
Hey, fisherman!

910
01:29:15.266 --> 01:29:16.167
Come on!

911
01:30:21.457 --> 01:30:23.333
No!

912
01:31:10.423 --> 01:31:11.620
I'm a god.

913
01:31:12.383 --> 01:31:14.092
I will live forever.

914
01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:15.719
But not here.

915
01:32:41.472 --> 01:32:43.267
The boats are coming for us.

916
01:32:48.899 --> 01:32:50.316
For you.
Not for me.

917
01:32:51.816 --> 01:32:53.273
You won't stay, will you?

918
01:32:55.111 --> 01:32:56.986
Perseus, Argos needs a ruler.

919
01:32:57.863 --> 01:32:59.034
I cannot be a king.

920
01:33:00.199 --> 01:33:01.857
I serve you better as a man.

921
01:33:03.285 --> 01:33:05.000
You'll make a fine queen for them.

922
01:33:45.752 --> 01:33:47.696
Olympus owes you a debt of gratitude.

923
01:33:50.207 --> 01:33:51.243
As do I.

924
01:33:51.922 --> 01:33:52.955
Hades lives.

925
01:33:54.086 --> 01:33:55.753
He's just sent back to the underworld.

926
01:33:56.547 --> 01:33:58.395
Biding his time, no doubt.

927
01:33:58.674 --> 01:34:02.385
Waiting for men to grow weak,
and in their weakness, he grows stronger.

928
01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:05.738
It's mankind who holds the key
to Hades' rise.

929
01:34:05.892 --> 01:34:06.889
It always was.

930
01:34:07.086 --> 01:34:08.650
So we'll see him again.

931
01:34:09.706 --> 01:34:10.416
Yes.

932
01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:13.489
But now the world knows
a man can stop him.

933
01:34:14.899 --> 01:34:15.793
Of course,

934
01:34:16.352 --> 01:34:17.524
you had some help.

935
01:34:17.784 --> 01:34:18.817
A sword.

936
01:34:19.123 --> 01:34:20.350
The Pegasus.

937
01:34:22.384 --> 01:34:24.068
I wanted men to worship us again,

938
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:26.056
but I didn't want it to cost me a son.

939
01:34:28.954 --> 01:34:30.246
That's almost human of you.

940
01:34:30.846 --> 01:34:34.209
I don't suppose you'll reconsider my offer
to take your place as one of us.

941
01:34:38.797 --> 01:34:40.599
I've got everything I need right here.

942
01:34:42.071 --> 01:34:43.947
You may not want to be a god Perseus.

943
01:34:44.662 --> 01:34:47.649
But after feats like yours,
men will worship you.

944
01:34:48.974 --> 01:34:50.137
Be good to them.

945
01:34:51.018 --> 01:34:52.637
Be better than we were.

946
01:34:54.378 --> 01:34:58.060
And if you insist on continuing
this mundane human existence,

947
01:34:58.108 --> 01:34:59.901
I won't have you do it alone.

948
01:35:01.307 --> 01:35:02.978
You're the son of Zeus, after all.

949
