1
00:06:25.942 --> 00:06:26.945
Yes?

2
00:06:27.047 --> 00:06:28.943
Please inform Signor Ferrari

3
00:06:29.045 --> 00:06:32.948
<i>that the Maserati driver Jean
Behra has just arrived from Milan.</i>

4
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.417
Hmm. Thank you.

5
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.653
Thank you, most excellent
and gracious signora.

6
00:07:03.386 --> 00:07:04.213
Yes?

7
00:07:04.316 --> 00:07:06.687
<i>Laura. It's Chiti. Is he there?</i>

8
00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:08.254
He's taking a shower.

9
00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:11.888
Give him a message, please.
Jean Behra is in town.

10
00:07:20.702 --> 00:07:21.763
How are you?

11
00:07:45.023 --> 00:07:46.425
Signor Ferrari?

12
00:07:47.025 --> 00:07:48.427
Signor Ferrari!

13
00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:50.357
May I present myself?

14
00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:52.530
I am Alfonso de Portago.

15
00:08:06.243 --> 00:08:08.376
Wow.

16
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.955
It's Ferrari.

17
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.163
Good morning, Enzo!
Your friends are back.

18
00:08:27.265 --> 00:08:29.664
This time, I hope in tune.

19
00:08:29.767 --> 00:08:32.537
More in tune than your
cars in Monaco last week.

20
00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:35.804
Enzo! We have to talk.

21
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.173
That bad?

22
00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:39.874
I will come by later.

23
00:09:11.945 --> 00:09:12.945
Yes.

24
00:09:13.014 --> 00:09:14.313
<i>Behra is here.</i>

25
00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:16.124
<i>The Orsi brothers collected
him at the station.</i>

26
00:09:16.148 --> 00:09:17.782
<i>Did signora tell you?</i>

27
00:09:17.885 --> 00:09:19.053
<i>The word is</i>

28
00:09:19.155 --> 00:09:20.952
he's going to
challenge our record.

29
00:09:21.054 --> 00:09:22.321
Is the 801 ready?

30
00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:24.924
After the Workers Mass
at 9:00. After that.

31
00:09:25.026 --> 00:09:27.056
I'll call Castellotti.

32
00:09:27.158 --> 00:09:28.158
Behra's here.

33
00:09:28.194 --> 00:09:29.760
Really?

34
00:09:29.862 --> 00:09:32.528
So many phone calls, I thought
Frank Sinatra came to town.

35
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.927
Hotel Medici, Firenze.
What do I tell them?

36
00:09:35.029 --> 00:09:37.170
"Excuse me, please,
my husband isn't here.

37
00:09:37.272 --> 00:09:40.172
He's out whoring.
<i>Grazie, buongiorno."</i>

38
00:09:40.274 --> 00:09:42.209
Signor Castellotti,
please. Enzo.

39
00:09:42.312 --> 00:09:45.709
I don't give a fuck who
you screw or how many.

40
00:09:46.743 --> 00:09:48.678
But the rule is that
you have to be here

41
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.846
before the maid arrives
with the morning coffee.

42
00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:53.416
- That was the agreement, was it not?
- Laura, please.

43
00:09:53.518 --> 00:09:55.789
<i>Buongiorno, signora,
Commendatore.</i>

44
00:10:02.764 --> 00:10:03.622
<i>Pronto.</i>

45
00:10:03.724 --> 00:10:05.358
<i>Eugenio, my boy.</i>

46
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.729
<i>Commendatore.</i>

47
00:10:06.831 --> 00:10:09.932
<i>Can you be at the Modena
Autodrome by 11:00?</i>

48
00:10:10.368 --> 00:10:11.735
Bring your lucky gloves.

49
00:10:12.335 --> 00:10:13.435
What gloves?

50
00:10:13.537 --> 00:10:14.817
<i>The gloves that will beat Behra,</i>

51
00:10:14.871 --> 00:10:17.070
<i>who's come to steal
from you our record.</i>

52
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.741
I'll be there.

53
00:10:19.843 --> 00:10:21.309
Good. Will that
be all, signora?

54
00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:23.113
That'll be all.

55
00:10:23.215 --> 00:10:25.113
Laura, the car broke.

56
00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:33.088
What's going on in there?

57
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.662
Her gentleness, the signora, is
trying to shoot the <i>Commendatore.</i>

58
00:10:39.796 --> 00:10:42.731
<i>Buongiorno,</i> Peppino.
I let him live.

59
00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:45.205
That gun was given to
you for your protection.

60
00:10:45.307 --> 00:10:47.573
And talk to Cuoghi.
You're going broke.

61
00:10:49.573 --> 00:10:51.375
I knew it would come to this.

62
00:10:51.477 --> 00:10:53.109
You gave her a
gun, she'll use it.

63
00:10:53.211 --> 00:10:56.549
She carries the payroll for the
factory around in that handbag.

64
00:10:56.651 --> 00:10:59.916
I'd rearm Germany before
I gave that woman a gun.

65
00:11:00.018 --> 00:11:03.354
Peppino will take you and Laura
to the cemetery this morning.

66
00:11:03.456 --> 00:11:04.886
And don't forget
the Workers Mass

67
00:11:04.988 --> 00:11:07.158
unless you want to pay
higher wages next year.

68
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.694
Don't fight with Laura.

69
00:11:08.796 --> 00:11:10.060
Mm.

70
00:11:10.863 --> 00:11:14.062
Good morning. No one was
hurt, so don't make a fuss.

71
00:11:14.164 --> 00:11:15.164
What?

72
00:11:15.234 --> 00:11:16.869
What have I said?

73
00:11:49.203 --> 00:11:50.735
Morning, <i>Commendatore.</i>

74
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.473
Good morning.

75
00:11:58.909 --> 00:12:01.141
Did you know who was in the car?

76
00:12:01.676 --> 00:12:03.409
It was Jean Behra.

77
00:12:03.512 --> 00:12:06.152
Don't panic, Matteo. If they take
the record, we shall take it back.

78
00:12:07.521 --> 00:12:09.820
How did our football
team do yesterday?

79
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.459
You know damn well. We lost.

80
00:12:13.561 --> 00:12:16.393
Oh, one long catalog
of disaster it's been.

81
00:12:16.495 --> 00:12:18.059
How long since you took over?

82
00:12:18.627 --> 00:12:19.960
What about Le Mans?

83
00:12:20.062 --> 00:12:22.302
Jaguar one, two and
three. What's that?

84
00:12:22.404 --> 00:12:27.103
Well, from my mistakes I learn, whereas the
mistakes you make you repeat, week after week.

85
00:12:27.739 --> 00:12:29.837
When you play Bologna,
I hope you win.

86
00:12:29.939 --> 00:12:31.776
Otherwise I have to
relocate the factory

87
00:12:31.878 --> 00:12:35.112
so the drivers are not
dispirited by living in a city

88
00:12:35.214 --> 00:12:39.717
whose football team dwells in the
perpetual twilight of failure.

89
00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:42.186
The Modena Football Club
is the pride of Emilia.

90
00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:24.125
Cuoghi wants to meet.

91
00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:29.163
That means bad news.

92
00:13:37.742 --> 00:13:39.910
Now, your mother
missed on purpose.

93
00:13:42.312 --> 00:13:45.212
One day she won't, and then
I'll be in here with you.

94
00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:57.125
I'm hearing voices
in my sleep again.

95
00:13:59.232 --> 00:14:00.733
My brother.

96
00:14:01.531 --> 00:14:02.999
And my father.

97
00:14:05.207 --> 00:14:07.135
No, I see their faces too.

98
00:14:09.374 --> 00:14:10.974
But also now,

99
00:14:11.708 --> 00:14:13.909
Campari and Borzacchini,

100
00:14:14.011 --> 00:14:16.282
my two good friends who
died on the same day

101
00:14:16.384 --> 00:14:19.449
24 years ago this week at Monza

102
00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:21.314
on that evil afternoon.

103
00:14:25.895 --> 00:14:27.188
Ghosts.

104
00:14:32.501 --> 00:14:34.767
There was a time I
loved your mother...

105
00:14:36.533 --> 00:14:37.935
beyond reason.

106
00:14:41.577 --> 00:14:43.809
Well, she was a
different creature then.

107
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.812
But so was I.

108
00:14:49.416 --> 00:14:51.113
And I see you too, you know.

109
00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:58.626
Every moment I close my eyes.

110
00:15:24.946 --> 00:15:27.017
Your face I want to see.

111
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.224
Okay.

112
00:15:37.132 --> 00:15:38.732
Okay.

113
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.130
I go to deal with today.

114
00:16:15.068 --> 00:16:19.135
Did I tell you of my son
Alfredo, Enzo's older brother?

115
00:16:19.802 --> 00:16:21.335
Many times, signora.

116
00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:22.769
A tragedy.

117
00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:25.240
I lost him in the Great War.

118
00:16:26.148 --> 00:16:27.308
Yes, signora.

119
00:16:27.908 --> 00:16:29.347
Let me tell you,

120
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:31.081
the wrong son died.

121
00:18:03.678 --> 00:18:05.841
If Jesus had lived today

122
00:18:05.944 --> 00:18:08.815
and not two thousand years ago,

123
00:18:08.917 --> 00:18:11.984
he would have been born in
a small town like Modena.

124
00:18:12.852 --> 00:18:16.150
He would have been
not a carpenter

125
00:18:16.252 --> 00:18:19.222
but a craftsman in
metal like yourselves.

126
00:18:20.195 --> 00:18:21.962
So a God,

127
00:18:22.064 --> 00:18:26.262
who understood, as a carpenter,
the perfection of the adze,

128
00:18:26.364 --> 00:18:30.765
appreciates, as an engineer,
the precision of your lathe.

129
00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:33.066
The nature of metal.

130
00:18:33.168 --> 00:18:36.303
How it can be forged, shaped

131
00:18:36.405 --> 00:18:40.041
and hammered by your
skills into an engine,

132
00:18:40.143 --> 00:18:44.011
holding inside a
fire to make power

133
00:18:44.113 --> 00:18:46.546
to speed us through the world.

134
00:18:48.416 --> 00:18:51.422
Which is why we give
thanks to him today.

135
00:18:55.726 --> 00:18:57.029
Are you okay?

136
00:21:01.184 --> 00:21:03.081
May God be with you.

137
00:21:03.183 --> 00:21:05.122
Now go in peace.

138
00:21:05.224 --> 00:21:09.826
<i>In nomine Patris, Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

139
00:21:09.928 --> 00:21:11.531
Amen. Amen.

140
00:21:11.633 --> 00:21:14.199
Very good. Okay. Great.

141
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.503
Great.

142
00:21:23.478 --> 00:21:25.037
Great, great.

143
00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:26.442
Very, very good.

144
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.744
1:32.7.

145
00:21:28.846 --> 00:21:30.613
I had 1:32.9.

146
00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:32.848
Signor Ferrari, a Maserati...

147
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.048
Only for the moment.

148
00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.486
When do we take it back?

149
00:21:35.588 --> 00:21:36.785
Right now.

150
00:21:43.298 --> 00:21:44.328
Okay!

151
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.272
Glad you could make it, Eugenio.

152
00:21:57.374 --> 00:22:00.679
Okay, take it easy
till the tires warm up,

153
00:22:00.781 --> 00:22:02.210
then put your foot down.

154
00:22:02.312 --> 00:22:05.217
She'll do 1:30 if
given a chance.

155
00:22:06.216 --> 00:22:08.220
Look after Cecilia, will you?

156
00:22:37.011 --> 00:22:39.619
Two laps, and the
tires will be warm.

157
00:22:39.721 --> 00:22:40.721
That's good.

158
00:22:40.819 --> 00:22:42.452
Cecilia Manzini?

159
00:22:46.221 --> 00:22:47.754
I knew your mother.

160
00:23:11.949 --> 00:23:13.879
One minute 34.

161
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.256
He's slow.

162
00:23:25.798 --> 00:23:27.695
Signor Ferrari?

163
00:23:28.263 --> 00:23:30.302
Alfonso de Portago.

164
00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:36.240
We met on the Largo Garibaldi.

165
00:23:36.342 --> 00:23:38.537
Yes, sir. I was seeking
to introduce myself.

166
00:23:38.639 --> 00:23:40.840
Yeah, but the light,
it turned green.

167
00:23:51.824 --> 00:23:54.822
You bought one of my cars last
year and won the Tour de France.

168
00:23:54.924 --> 00:23:56.060
Yes.

169
00:23:56.162 --> 00:23:57.437
Now I'm looking
for a works drive.

170
00:23:57.461 --> 00:23:59.925
I don't need another
driver, Portago.

171
00:24:56.956 --> 00:24:58.489
De Portago.

172
00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:02.460
Call my office on Monday.

173
00:25:12.632 --> 00:25:15.242
I woke you. No, I was up.

174
00:25:15.942 --> 00:25:17.675
Did I wake the boy?

175
00:25:17.777 --> 00:25:18.806
Let me.

176
00:25:37.965 --> 00:25:39.530
You haven't said a word.

177
00:25:40.395 --> 00:25:42.366
What is there to say?

178
00:25:42.468 --> 00:25:45.272
The newspapers, the
radio, they have it all.

179
00:25:45.937 --> 00:25:46.966
They do?

180
00:25:49.343 --> 00:25:51.773
Was he your friend,
the young Castellotti?

181
00:25:53.844 --> 00:25:56.877
Or was it your fault? The
car's fault? His fault?

182
00:25:59.387 --> 00:26:02.014
Will you miss him? Does
that bring the boy back?

183
00:26:03.852 --> 00:26:06.755
Why do you push like
that? Why do you think?

184
00:26:08.127 --> 00:26:09.824
I know it matters to you.

185
00:26:11.129 --> 00:26:13.394
To me? Come on.

186
00:26:13.497 --> 00:26:15.797
Twenty-four years ago this week,

187
00:26:16.464 --> 00:26:18.371
I lost two friends.

188
00:26:19.006 --> 00:26:20.736
Campari and Borzacchini.

189
00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:24.311
At Monza, in the metal I made.

190
00:26:27.542 --> 00:26:29.782
So I knew then it was,

191
00:26:29.884 --> 00:26:31.978
"Enzo, build a wall."

192
00:26:34.886 --> 00:26:36.484
Or?

193
00:26:36.586 --> 00:26:38.787
Or, "Enzo, go do
something else."

194
00:26:54.576 --> 00:26:58.978
"Ferrari is an industrial Saturn
devouring his own children.

195
00:26:59.081 --> 00:27:02.545
First Tornaco,
now Castellotti."

196
00:27:02.648 --> 00:27:05.484
If you continue killing
the nation's heroes,

197
00:27:05.586 --> 00:27:08.618
we'll have to go to America
and live among foreigners.

198
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.691
I did not kill Castellotti.
The papers blame you.

199
00:27:11.793 --> 00:27:12.992
It wasn't me.

200
00:27:13.094 --> 00:27:15.021
If anyone, it was his mother.

201
00:27:16.028 --> 00:27:17.129
It's true.

202
00:27:17.231 --> 00:27:19.795
He was engaged to
Cecilia Manzini.

203
00:27:19.897 --> 00:27:23.061
His mother wanted him to
marry a woman with more class.

204
00:27:23.163 --> 00:27:26.366
As a result of the weight
she put on his shoulders,

205
00:27:26.468 --> 00:27:27.802
he became distracted,

206
00:27:27.904 --> 00:27:31.371
he lost his concentration,
he crashed and died.

207
00:27:31.473 --> 00:27:33.173
He blames the mother!

208
00:27:33.275 --> 00:27:36.244
What I'm saying is, when a mother
interferes in this business,

209
00:27:36.346 --> 00:27:38.077
death usually follows.

210
00:27:43.957 --> 00:27:45.354
Call the bank.

211
00:27:45.456 --> 00:27:47.658
Cancel Castellotti's salary.

212
00:27:50.095 --> 00:27:51.594
And call Chiti.

213
00:27:51.697 --> 00:27:55.160
I need a report on the
car for the insurers.

214
00:27:59.137 --> 00:28:00.539
Yes, signora.

215
00:28:17.651 --> 00:28:19.426
There's Ferrari.

216
00:28:24.593 --> 00:28:26.098
Why is the damn top down?

217
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.497
I didn't want to get it wet.

218
00:28:27.599 --> 00:28:29.569
It belongs to King
Hussein. Get it inside.

219
00:28:29.671 --> 00:28:31.843
And make sure the cockpit's
dry before you hand it over.

220
00:28:31.867 --> 00:28:33.902
Yes, sir, <i>Commendatore.</i>

221
00:28:42.277 --> 00:28:45.181
Stall the king and tell them
to get a move on in the shop.

222
00:28:45.283 --> 00:28:46.519
Yes, <i>Commendatore.</i>

223
00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:50.322
So?

224
00:28:50.424 --> 00:28:52.252
You're going broke.
Laura's right.

225
00:28:52.354 --> 00:28:53.986
How? How?

226
00:28:54.088 --> 00:28:56.295
You spend more than
you make, that's how.

227
00:28:56.397 --> 00:28:58.826
The production cars
pay for the racing.

228
00:28:58.929 --> 00:29:02.029
I could run Portugal on
what you spend on racing.

229
00:29:03.197 --> 00:29:05.937
How many production cars
did you make last year?

230
00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:08.974
Uh, 140, 150.

231
00:29:09.076 --> 00:29:11.504
Ninety-eight. 198.

232
00:29:11.606 --> 00:29:14.140
No. Ninety-eight.

233
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.179
So what do I do?

234
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:18.650
Find a partner.

235
00:29:18.752 --> 00:29:22.217
I have a partner. My wife.
She is very mean with money.

236
00:29:22.319 --> 00:29:23.585
A real partner.

237
00:29:23.687 --> 00:29:26.192
Like Agnelli at
Fiat or Henry Ford.

238
00:29:26.294 --> 00:29:27.657
Someone who has
capital to pump in.

239
00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.227
No. Impossible. With
money, they want control.

240
00:29:30.329 --> 00:29:31.729
I must have total control.

241
00:29:31.831 --> 00:29:34.465
The right partner would help
with the production cars,

242
00:29:34.567 --> 00:29:37.064
while you do what you
like with the racing.

243
00:29:38.771 --> 00:29:42.534
Increase production to
400 customer cars a year.

244
00:29:42.636 --> 00:29:44.137
Attract finance.

245
00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:47.242
Then you can negotiate.

246
00:29:47.344 --> 00:29:51.109
How do we make... never mind how do
we sell... 400 customer cars a year?

247
00:29:51.211 --> 00:29:53.845
Jaguar took the first
three places at Le Mans.

248
00:29:53.948 --> 00:29:56.520
Now their sales books are full.

249
00:29:56.622 --> 00:29:59.756
You win on Sunday,
you sell on Monday.

250
00:29:59.858 --> 00:30:02.557
You already have kings
waiting in line. Mm, Jaguar.

251
00:30:02.659 --> 00:30:05.593
Jaguar races only to sell cars.

252
00:30:05.695 --> 00:30:07.498
I sell cars only to be racing.

253
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.465
We are completely
different organisms.

254
00:30:09.568 --> 00:30:12.137
Survive, or you are no organism.

255
00:30:12.239 --> 00:30:14.068
Hello.

256
00:30:16.804 --> 00:30:19.071
I am Alfonso de Portago.

257
00:30:19.173 --> 00:30:21.746
I have an appointment
with Signor Ferrari.

258
00:30:24.481 --> 00:30:26.047
Take a seat, please.

259
00:30:34.493 --> 00:30:36.557
Win the Mille Miglia, Enzo.

260
00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:38.361
Attract outside finance.

261
00:30:38.463 --> 00:30:40.193
Or you are out of business.

262
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.345
Signor Ferrari, this
is Don Alfonso...

263
00:30:53.447 --> 00:30:55.444
Yeah, I know who
it is. Cuoghi!

264
00:30:55.546 --> 00:30:57.177
The Marquis de Portago!

265
00:31:02.551 --> 00:31:03.821
Hey, Ferrari!

266
00:31:04.519 --> 00:31:05.757
Cuoghi!

267
00:31:11.263 --> 00:31:12.732
One more thing.

268
00:31:12.834 --> 00:31:15.360
How did Laura get her hands
on the freehold to the plant?

269
00:31:16.536 --> 00:31:18.296
The Nazis were
about to arrest me.

270
00:31:18.398 --> 00:31:21.073
I put it in her name along
with half the shares.

271
00:31:21.175 --> 00:31:22.774
We built it together.

272
00:31:23.275 --> 00:31:24.409
Get it back.

273
00:31:24.511 --> 00:31:26.278
If you face up to
Agnelli or Ford,

274
00:31:26.381 --> 00:31:27.940
you have to hold all the cards.

275
00:31:28.042 --> 00:31:29.983
Well, it's easier
said than done.

276
00:31:30.085 --> 00:31:31.085
Ferrari!

277
00:31:31.446 --> 00:31:32.479
Ah.

278
00:31:32.581 --> 00:31:33.645
Your Majesty!

279
00:31:33.747 --> 00:31:34.981
One more thing.

280
00:31:35.083 --> 00:31:37.256
If I'm in bad shape,
what of Maserati?

281
00:31:37.358 --> 00:31:39.591
Worse. I give them six months.

282
00:31:39.693 --> 00:31:41.354
They've gone to the
French for finance.

283
00:31:41.456 --> 00:31:44.961
And they, too, will try to prove
themselves at the Mille Miglia.

284
00:31:45.063 --> 00:31:48.866
Everyone's eye will be on
it. Only one team will win.

285
00:31:49.863 --> 00:31:51.869
Make sure it's you.

286
00:31:55.905 --> 00:31:58.139
- Your Highness!
- Which Highness?

287
00:31:59.712 --> 00:32:02.379
That Highness. You,
get out to the track.

288
00:32:02.481 --> 00:32:04.112
Your Majesty, come this way.

289
00:32:07.951 --> 00:32:10.251
I hope you got my
measurements right.

290
00:32:10.353 --> 00:32:14.254
Last time my feet could barely
touch the pedals. Of course.

291
00:32:52.926 --> 00:32:54.965
He drives like Varzi.

292
00:33:54.325 --> 00:33:55.520
Well,

293
00:33:56.461 --> 00:33:57.764
how did I do?

294
00:33:58.566 --> 00:34:00.492
You drive like Varzi.

295
00:34:01.869 --> 00:34:04.497
Your duties will include
testing and road racing.

296
00:34:04.599 --> 00:34:07.306
The Mille Miglia? You'll
drive a works 250.

297
00:34:07.408 --> 00:34:09.005
Not the most powerful car,

298
00:34:09.107 --> 00:34:11.138
but reliable and it goes
like hell round corners,

299
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.406
so I'll expect you
to be in the points.

300
00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.907
Actresses.

301
00:34:16.743 --> 00:34:19.248
I have admiration, but keep
them away from the paddock.

302
00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:22.780
They distract photographers,
whose attention I want on my cars.

303
00:34:22.883 --> 00:34:24.385
Understand?

304
00:34:24.487 --> 00:34:26.056
Okay.

305
00:34:39.504 --> 00:34:40.504
Peter.

306
00:34:42.074 --> 00:34:44.406
Look after our new driver.
He's wet and hungry.

307
00:34:44.509 --> 00:34:45.972
Hello, Fon.

308
00:34:46.074 --> 00:34:47.808
How do you do? Pa. Papa, Papa!

309
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:49.075
What are you doing here?

310
00:34:49.177 --> 00:34:51.481
Get the autograph.
Whose, Collins?

311
00:34:51.583 --> 00:34:53.380
No, de Portago's.

312
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.382
All right.

313
00:35:01.694 --> 00:35:03.225
I could eat a horse.

314
00:35:06.699 --> 00:35:08.899
Stop pretending you can count.

315
00:35:09.002 --> 00:35:12.234
Good to see you. How
are you? How's your son?

316
00:35:12.799 --> 00:35:13.936
Fon.

317
00:35:14.038 --> 00:35:15.901
Mike Hawthorn, future
world champion.

318
00:35:16.003 --> 00:35:17.538
The famous von Trips.

319
00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.273
Olivier Gendebien, the best
sports car driver in the world.

320
00:35:21.375 --> 00:35:24.479
Taruffi, the oldest.
Truly the best.

321
00:35:24.581 --> 00:35:28.847
Chiti, the best engineer,
but always, always anxious.

322
00:35:28.949 --> 00:35:30.517
And Scaglietti.

323
00:35:30.619 --> 00:35:34.519
Working on a project so secret
we are not allowed to discuss.

324
00:35:34.621 --> 00:35:36.889
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Maserati.

325
00:35:36.991 --> 00:35:39.596
So, de Portago, what brings
you to this neck of the woods

326
00:35:39.698 --> 00:35:43.535
when everyone knows the future of chassis
technology with rear engines is in England?

327
00:35:43.637 --> 00:35:44.898
Rear engines? Yes.

328
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.366
The ox must pull the cart.

329
00:35:46.468 --> 00:35:49.370
What we need is more power.
You hear that, Chiti?

330
00:35:49.971 --> 00:35:51.840
But they turn quick.

331
00:35:51.943 --> 00:35:53.407
And have no straight-line speed.

332
00:35:53.509 --> 00:35:55.943
And the English, they have a
new invention called brakes,

333
00:35:56.045 --> 00:35:58.016
unlike my 250.

334
00:35:58.983 --> 00:36:00.582
All right. To de Portago.

335
00:36:00.684 --> 00:36:02.548
Cheers.

336
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:07.025
To de Portago's hair.

337
00:36:07.956 --> 00:36:09.456
Don't you think?

338
00:36:18.733 --> 00:36:20.304
Fon!

339
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.802
Are you running
around like that?

340
00:36:22.904 --> 00:36:24.440
Oh!

341
00:37:16.497 --> 00:37:18.063
What's so funny?

342
00:37:18.661 --> 00:37:19.966
Uh...

343
00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.032
I wondered when you'd be back.

344
00:37:23.134 --> 00:37:26.271
How can I stay away?
It's the plums.

345
00:37:31.775 --> 00:37:33.204
Where's Piero?

346
00:37:33.306 --> 00:37:34.739
On his way home from school.

347
00:37:36.112 --> 00:37:38.882
He asked me yesterday. What?

348
00:37:38.984 --> 00:37:42.087
"Am I Piero Lardi
or Piero Ferrari?"

349
00:38:00.408 --> 00:38:01.604
Papa!

350
00:38:01.706 --> 00:38:03.042
Have you got it?

351
00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.774
The autograph. No.

352
00:38:05.876 --> 00:38:07.910
Oh. He hasn't, uh,

353
00:38:08.012 --> 00:38:10.349
had a proper picture taken yet.

354
00:38:10.451 --> 00:38:11.550
What autograph?

355
00:38:11.652 --> 00:38:13.080
De Portago. From Spain.

356
00:38:13.182 --> 00:38:15.054
He's going to drive for me.

357
00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:17.749
Great.

358
00:38:22.729 --> 00:38:24.529
Why do you like him so much?

359
00:38:24.631 --> 00:38:25.996
He drives like Varzi.

360
00:38:26.098 --> 00:38:28.729
I'm going to be a
driver. Like you.

361
00:38:29.398 --> 00:38:32.196
No, not like me. I
only won a few races.

362
00:38:32.298 --> 00:38:34.040
This is much better.

363
00:38:34.968 --> 00:38:36.504
Why?

364
00:38:39.412 --> 00:38:40.673
Okay.

365
00:38:41.607 --> 00:38:43.643
Pretend you're
inside this engine.

366
00:38:45.213 --> 00:38:47.251
In the intake manifold.

367
00:38:48.249 --> 00:38:50.389
Right here. Really pretend.

368
00:38:50.491 --> 00:38:51.651
You're tiny.

369
00:38:52.352 --> 00:38:53.886
The size of a little ant.

370
00:38:53.989 --> 00:38:55.457
Now look up.

371
00:38:56.926 --> 00:38:58.196
It's silver.

372
00:38:59.192 --> 00:39:00.564
What do you see?

373
00:39:00.666 --> 00:39:02.127
A big tunnel.

374
00:39:02.229 --> 00:39:04.302
Like a pipe, yes?

375
00:39:04.872 --> 00:39:08.006
Now pretend water races through.

376
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:10.703
And when it hits this
side, what does it do?

377
00:39:11.811 --> 00:39:13.240
Some will splash sideways.

378
00:39:13.342 --> 00:39:18.150
But if I make the
curve more gentle,

379
00:39:19.014 --> 00:39:20.914
more slippery,

380
00:39:21.016 --> 00:39:22.451
what does it do?

381
00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.816
It will go faster.

382
00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:30.593
Fuel and air will move
faster just like the water.

383
00:39:31.129 --> 00:39:33.099
And that is all an engine does.

384
00:39:33.534 --> 00:39:35.163
Moves fuel in,

385
00:39:35.265 --> 00:39:37.065
sparks them into
rapid expansion,

386
00:39:37.168 --> 00:39:40.172
moves old gases
out, new fuel in.

387
00:39:40.274 --> 00:39:43.109
And the faster it can do
that, the more power you make.

388
00:39:49.583 --> 00:39:51.315
It looks better.

389
00:39:52.783 --> 00:39:54.120
Does it?

390
00:39:57.022 --> 00:39:58.718
I have a secret to tell you.

391
00:39:59.725 --> 00:40:00.791
In all life,

392
00:40:00.893 --> 00:40:02.653
when a thing works better,

393
00:40:02.755 --> 00:40:05.089
usually it is more
beautiful to the eye.

394
00:40:07.295 --> 00:40:09.201
Piero, go wash up.

395
00:40:13.506 --> 00:40:14.569
Mmm.

396
00:40:17.272 --> 00:40:19.305
Are you staying to eat?

397
00:40:19.407 --> 00:40:21.075
I'll sit with you and Piero.

398
00:40:21.177 --> 00:40:22.410
Will you come back after?

399
00:40:22.512 --> 00:40:25.443
It depends. I'll try.
Mm, depends on what?

400
00:40:25.545 --> 00:40:27.747
On how business with her goes.

401
00:40:32.252 --> 00:40:33.786
I'm too easy.

402
00:40:34.959 --> 00:40:36.426
What do you mean?

403
00:40:36.993 --> 00:40:38.630
Too modern.

404
00:40:39.433 --> 00:40:41.964
I should give you lots of shit
like a normal Italian woman.

405
00:40:42.066 --> 00:40:43.360
I prefer you like you are.

406
00:40:43.462 --> 00:40:45.171
Oh, I'm sure you do.

407
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.675
What I should become
is the mistress.

408
00:40:49.777 --> 00:40:52.175
"Oh, Enzo! I feel so sad.

409
00:40:52.277 --> 00:40:55.544
Buy me a fur coat and
a diamond necklace."

410
00:40:56.142 --> 00:40:57.546
Piero!

411
00:40:58.211 --> 00:40:59.647
Sit down.

412
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:06.823
Don't worry. I do not
plan to change who I am.

413
00:41:06.925 --> 00:41:08.656
Thank you. Thank you?

414
00:41:10.598 --> 00:41:11.791
For nothing.

415
00:41:13.294 --> 00:41:14.928
It's not for you.

416
00:41:15.698 --> 00:41:18.600
Do you know the hardest
part of my life with you?

417
00:41:19.301 --> 00:41:21.640
There is none. There is.

418
00:41:21.742 --> 00:41:23.341
What? Being away.

419
00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.941
While with me... what
do the English say?

420
00:41:27.043 --> 00:41:28.578
A piece of pie?

421
00:41:29.147 --> 00:41:30.942
Cake, Enzo. And you're not.

422
00:41:53.005 --> 00:41:54.504
Thank you, Alda.

423
00:41:57.239 --> 00:41:59.510
Those are from Cuoghi.

424
00:41:59.612 --> 00:42:03.042
He says our days are numbered
unless we find a new partner.

425
00:42:03.711 --> 00:42:06.077
One of the big
companies. Fiat or Ford.

426
00:42:06.179 --> 00:42:07.515
No.

427
00:42:07.617 --> 00:42:09.652
You've never had a
boss. You won't like it.

428
00:42:09.754 --> 00:42:12.685
In order to attract this partner,
he says we have to expand.

429
00:42:12.788 --> 00:42:15.091
He's talking about
building 400 cars a year.

430
00:42:15.194 --> 00:42:17.596
How do we sell 400 cars a year?

431
00:42:17.698 --> 00:42:21.027
We have to win the Mille Miglia, then
orders for sports cars will follow.

432
00:42:21.129 --> 00:42:25.129
This man knows contract law. What
does he know about motor racing?

433
00:42:25.231 --> 00:42:26.668
Hmm?

434
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:29.741
A thousand miles across bad
roads with sheep and dogs.

435
00:42:29.843 --> 00:42:30.870
Anything can happen.

436
00:42:33.009 --> 00:42:34.346
What else?

437
00:42:34.945 --> 00:42:36.007
What else?

438
00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:43.381
You should assign me control of your
stock in the company and the freehold,

439
00:42:43.483 --> 00:42:44.951
uh, so I can deal.

440
00:42:45.053 --> 00:42:46.389
Oh.

441
00:42:46.491 --> 00:42:48.921
Because Henry Ford
won't deal with a woman.

442
00:42:50.729 --> 00:42:52.024
No.

443
00:42:52.126 --> 00:42:55.364
Because if it comes to a
deal, it'll be hard and fast.

444
00:42:55.466 --> 00:42:57.499
I have to have all
the cards in my hand.

445
00:42:57.601 --> 00:43:00.036
Well, half the cards
are in my hand. Laura.

446
00:43:00.138 --> 00:43:02.105
What do you want me to say?

447
00:43:02.208 --> 00:43:06.239
"Mr. Ford, we have a deal, but first I must
wait until I ask my wife for permission"?

448
00:43:06.341 --> 00:43:08.072
Yes, you can say that.

449
00:43:12.412 --> 00:43:13.813
You know what?

450
00:43:13.915 --> 00:43:17.084
I'm gonna give you power
of attorney over my stock,

451
00:43:17.186 --> 00:43:18.753
so you can deal.

452
00:43:21.325 --> 00:43:22.994
For half a million dollars.

453
00:43:23.096 --> 00:43:25.127
I don't have half a million!

454
00:43:25.229 --> 00:43:28.092
You will if you make a deal.

455
00:43:30.598 --> 00:43:33.033
Okay, I'll give you a check.

456
00:43:33.136 --> 00:43:34.340
Post-dated.

457
00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.674
Not post-dated.

458
00:43:37.776 --> 00:43:39.915
I'll give you a check on condition
you promise not to cash it

459
00:43:39.939 --> 00:43:42.073
until and unless the
deal goes through.

460
00:43:44.049 --> 00:43:45.450
Is that reasonable?

461
00:43:55.357 --> 00:43:56.626
Is that reasonable?

462
00:44:03.067 --> 00:44:04.370
We need this.

463
00:44:05.465 --> 00:44:06.966
One condition.

464
00:44:07.806 --> 00:44:08.935
What?

465
00:44:11.241 --> 00:44:12.774
I want my gun back.

466
00:44:13.339 --> 00:44:14.644
What?

467
00:44:16.015 --> 00:44:17.548
I want my gun back.

468
00:45:11.732 --> 00:45:14.539
Did you sign de Portago? Yes.

469
00:45:15.174 --> 00:45:16.838
I'll draw up a contract.

470
00:45:18.476 --> 00:45:20.908
And I need money
for Cecilia Manzini.

471
00:45:22.982 --> 00:45:24.276
How much money?

472
00:45:24.378 --> 00:45:25.979
25,000.

473
00:45:26.412 --> 00:45:27.851
What?

474
00:45:27.953 --> 00:45:29.183
25,000?

475
00:45:29.285 --> 00:45:30.588
She's broke.

476
00:45:31.992 --> 00:45:33.690
Her mother told me.

477
00:45:34.521 --> 00:45:35.820
Her mother?

478
00:45:35.922 --> 00:45:38.057
Have you been
fucking her mother?

479
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:39.762
What?

480
00:45:40.197 --> 00:45:41.666
Are you crazy?

481
00:45:42.102 --> 00:45:44.030
I want $25,000 in cash.

482
00:45:44.132 --> 00:45:46.668
Ah, you've been fucking the
mother and the daughter.

483
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:48.670
We have obligations
to that family. Both.

484
00:45:48.773 --> 00:45:51.974
Oh, obligations. So
compassionate. Sympathetic.

485
00:45:52.076 --> 00:45:53.677
Bullshit.

486
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.681
Fucking bullshit.

487
00:45:58.414 --> 00:46:00.585
I am compassionate!

488
00:46:05.055 --> 00:46:06.184
Five.

489
00:46:07.794 --> 00:46:08.824
Ten.

490
00:46:09.458 --> 00:46:11.556
Fifteen million lire.

491
00:46:11.658 --> 00:46:14.260
Or 25,000 US dollars.

492
00:46:14.362 --> 00:46:15.567
Please.

493
00:46:19.636 --> 00:46:21.304
How do you want
me to enter this?

494
00:46:21.407 --> 00:46:24.070
As a bequest to Signora Manzini.

495
00:46:24.605 --> 00:46:26.778
To buy a property.

496
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.481
She'll have the use of it,
but we'll retain the freehold.

497
00:46:29.583 --> 00:46:32.518
Ah, the same arrangement
as in, uh, Castelvetro.

498
00:46:33.987 --> 00:46:35.819
Castelvetro?

499
00:46:36.422 --> 00:46:38.717
We have a property
in Castelfranco.

500
00:46:38.819 --> 00:46:40.184
Oh. Yes, yes.

501
00:46:40.286 --> 00:46:42.990
I'm sorry. I got
the towns confused.

502
00:46:51.638 --> 00:46:55.007
I also need a banker's
order for a new driver.

503
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:56.568
His name is de Portago.

504
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:58.237
How do you spell that?

505
00:46:58.339 --> 00:47:00.109
D-E

506
00:47:00.211 --> 00:47:05.276
P-O-R-T-A-G-O.

507
00:47:11.155 --> 00:47:12.723
Thank you.

508
00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.989
Thank you.

509
00:47:35.444 --> 00:47:36.780
Castelvetro.

510
00:47:39.816 --> 00:47:42.786
As her gentleness,
the signora, commands.

511
00:47:51.658 --> 00:47:52.961
<i>Commendatore!</i>

512
00:47:53.628 --> 00:47:54.628
The press conference.

513
00:48:02.009 --> 00:48:05.208
He's dating Linda Christian, that
blonde who follows him around.

514
00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:07.006
Who is? De Portago.

515
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:10.613
Tyrone Power left Rita
Hayworth for the blonde.

516
00:48:10.715 --> 00:48:12.911
She left Tyrone
Power for de Portago.

517
00:48:13.013 --> 00:48:14.679
What are you reading,
<i>Commendatore?</i>

518
00:48:14.781 --> 00:48:16.385
"Rome Merry-Go-Round."

519
00:48:16.487 --> 00:48:19.186
Here's who will be there.

520
00:48:19.288 --> 00:48:22.454
And I will exclude Di Massimo
and Fusaro. They are the worst.

521
00:48:22.557 --> 00:48:24.058
No, no, no.

522
00:48:24.593 --> 00:48:26.258
I want them there.

523
00:48:41.808 --> 00:48:43.545
So what do you think?

524
00:48:43.648 --> 00:48:46.047
Ah, there is no ashtray.

525
00:48:47.748 --> 00:48:49.448
Are you a prima donna?

526
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:52.451
You ever tried flicking ash out of
a car at 200 kilometers an hour?

527
00:48:52.553 --> 00:48:55.760
I'm offering you a brand-new car
which has the edge on Maserati.

528
00:48:55.862 --> 00:48:59.193
Bullshit. The Maserati is
faster and it has an ashtray.

529
00:48:59.295 --> 00:49:02.767
If I put in an ashtray, will you
drive it in the Mille Miglia?

530
00:49:07.468 --> 00:49:08.671
Good.

531
00:49:08.773 --> 00:49:10.181
And don't ask me for
a navigator. Wha...

532
00:49:10.205 --> 00:49:13.176
You know every inch.
You've raced it 16 times.

533
00:49:13.912 --> 00:49:15.777
I can see in your eyes
you're going to ask me,

534
00:49:15.879 --> 00:49:17.879
and I'm not seduced
by you, silver fox.

535
00:49:17.982 --> 00:49:20.378
Get all these cleaned up
before the photo call.

536
00:49:21.585 --> 00:49:23.515
How'd she handle? Good.

537
00:49:24.117 --> 00:49:26.587
This is not, "How
was lunch?" "Good."

538
00:49:26.689 --> 00:49:28.089
I want to know brake wear.

539
00:49:28.191 --> 00:49:31.028
I want steering, suspension,
gear ratios, final drive.

540
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:34.066
If it's going to run in the Mille
Miglia, it's got to be 100%.

541
00:49:34.168 --> 00:49:35.398
Here, talk to him.

542
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.032
Go. Get inside.

543
00:49:44.673 --> 00:49:46.573
Okay, Di Massimo.

544
00:49:46.675 --> 00:49:48.076
Signor Ferrari.

545
00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:51.778
- I'm not an assassin.
- It was a figure of speech.

546
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:52.945
Uh, <i>Commendato...</i> Out!

547
00:49:53.047 --> 00:49:55.017
<i>Commendatore.</i> Out.

548
00:49:56.353 --> 00:49:57.887
Fusaro.

549
00:49:57.989 --> 00:50:00.692
You said I was Saturn
devouring his young children.

550
00:50:00.794 --> 00:50:03.187
I was merely quoting the
Vatican, <i>Commendatore.</i>

551
00:50:03.289 --> 00:50:06.230
- You too. Out.

552
00:50:06.332 --> 00:50:07.359
And you, Moretti.

553
00:50:08.432 --> 00:50:09.833
A "widow-maker."

554
00:50:09.935 --> 00:50:12.596
For the record, Castellotti
was not married, okay?

555
00:50:12.698 --> 00:50:14.003
Out.

556
00:50:15.142 --> 00:50:16.401
When we win,

557
00:50:16.503 --> 00:50:19.609
I can't see my cars for
shots of starlets' asses.

558
00:50:19.711 --> 00:50:21.411
When we lose,
you're a lynch mob.

559
00:50:23.275 --> 00:50:25.543
It's enough to
make the pope weep.

560
00:50:25.645 --> 00:50:27.148
Next.

561
00:50:28.482 --> 00:50:31.184
Let me introduce my spring
team for the Mille Miglia.

562
00:50:31.286 --> 00:50:33.985
Signor Ferrari! Ferrari!

563
00:50:34.087 --> 00:50:35.690
This is de Portago,

564
00:50:35.792 --> 00:50:37.922
Castellotti's replacement.

565
00:50:38.024 --> 00:50:39.630
But he drives like Varzi.

566
00:50:39.732 --> 00:50:41.794
Hey, Fon, is it true
about Linda Christian?

567
00:50:41.896 --> 00:50:42.994
She's your girlfriend?

568
00:50:43.096 --> 00:50:44.534
Don't answer that question.

569
00:50:44.636 --> 00:50:46.370
This is my old friend Taruffi.

570
00:50:46.472 --> 00:50:47.900
Last time he was second.

571
00:50:48.002 --> 00:50:50.508
This time he will be first.

572
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:53.806
Peter Collins. Future
world champion.

573
00:50:53.908 --> 00:50:56.476
Taffy von Trips. A tiger.

574
00:50:57.045 --> 00:50:58.749
And this is Olivier Gendebien,

575
00:50:58.852 --> 00:51:01.148
the fastest driver of
road cars in the world.

576
00:51:04.657 --> 00:51:06.186
Yes, all together.

577
00:51:06.288 --> 00:51:08.920
Smile. A smile.
Look at me, sir.

578
00:51:09.022 --> 00:51:10.628
Linda! Linda!

579
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.591
Linda, look over here!

580
00:51:13.294 --> 00:51:15.933
Linda, big smile! A
shot of you by the car!

581
00:51:16.898 --> 00:51:18.599
Linda! Linda, with the car!

582
00:51:25.511 --> 00:51:27.007
Rancati, a word after.

583
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:29.146
A word after. Smile!

584
00:51:29.249 --> 00:51:30.277
Hey, Linda!

585
00:51:49.795 --> 00:51:50.795
Stop.

586
00:51:50.862 --> 00:51:52.103
Stop.

587
00:51:52.205 --> 00:51:53.465
Go back.

588
00:51:54.438 --> 00:51:55.500
Go back.

589
00:52:07.914 --> 00:52:09.184
Turn right.

590
00:52:33.039 --> 00:52:34.308
Giuseppe.

591
00:52:42.055 --> 00:52:45.385
Rancati, there's something
I want you to do for me.

592
00:52:46.359 --> 00:52:48.053
Write an article

593
00:52:48.156 --> 00:52:51.761
suggesting that there are rumors

594
00:52:51.863 --> 00:52:54.698
that I'm talking
to Henry Ford II

595
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.627
about the future of the factory.

596
00:52:57.936 --> 00:53:01.573
At the end, say you
asked me, bluntly,

597
00:53:01.675 --> 00:53:04.470
and that I
categorically denied it.

598
00:53:06.076 --> 00:53:08.912
And are you?
Categorically denying it?

599
00:53:09.014 --> 00:53:11.609
Ah, yes, of course.
Categorically, I deny it.

600
00:53:14.653 --> 00:53:16.383
If I write this article,

601
00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:20.156
will you give me an exclusive
on your private life?

602
00:53:21.722 --> 00:53:23.627
Yes.

603
00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:25.392
If you promise
not to publish it.

604
00:53:28.127 --> 00:53:29.660
For the time being.

605
00:53:30.228 --> 00:53:32.135
Until I authorize it.

606
00:53:34.903 --> 00:53:37.470
Okay. It's a deal.

607
00:56:05.692 --> 00:56:07.151
You're going tonight?

608
00:56:07.253 --> 00:56:09.259
Yes. With my friends.

609
00:56:30.517 --> 00:56:31.644
He's quiet.

610
00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:35.312
I didn't get him de
Portago's autograph.

611
00:56:35.414 --> 00:56:37.588
It's not about that.

612
00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.187
What is it about?

613
00:56:39.289 --> 00:56:41.456
In two weeks,
he'll be confirmed.

614
00:56:42.022 --> 00:56:43.360
As whom?

615
00:56:43.929 --> 00:56:46.164
Piero Lardi or Piero Ferrari?

616
00:56:48.333 --> 00:56:51.028
We said when he was ten,
we would sort this out.

617
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:54.766
Then Dino's illness got worse,
and he's still Piero Lardi.

618
00:56:55.708 --> 00:56:57.142
I'm out of excuses.

619
00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.470
Postpone the confirmation.

620
00:56:59.572 --> 00:57:01.911
His whole class is
being confirmed.

621
00:57:02.013 --> 00:57:03.710
Say he lost his faith in God.

622
00:57:03.812 --> 00:57:04.875
Enzo.

623
00:57:05.752 --> 00:57:07.517
Who else knows about him?

624
00:57:07.619 --> 00:57:08.951
Nobody.

625
00:57:09.053 --> 00:57:10.815
Apart from the chief of police.

626
00:57:11.558 --> 00:57:12.623
The doctor?

627
00:57:12.725 --> 00:57:14.054
Well, yes, the doctor.

628
00:57:14.156 --> 00:57:15.724
And Piero's teachers.

629
00:57:15.826 --> 00:57:16.890
The teachers.

630
00:57:16.992 --> 00:57:18.662
Tavoni, Sergio.

631
00:57:18.764 --> 00:57:19.960
Of course, Tavoni.

632
00:57:20.062 --> 00:57:21.126
And the bank manager?

633
00:57:21.228 --> 00:57:22.459
The bank manager.

634
00:57:22.561 --> 00:57:24.229
Enzo. Apart from them, no one.

635
00:57:24.331 --> 00:57:27.033
Enzo, this is Italy. Yes?

636
00:57:27.135 --> 00:57:28.506
All of Modena knows!

637
00:57:28.608 --> 00:57:30.208
Except Laura.

638
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:33.204
And that must stay as it is.

639
00:57:33.306 --> 00:57:34.839
Especially for now.

640
00:57:36.848 --> 00:57:41.579
Oh, you're going to tell me, "Enzo,
don't be so bourgeois, so Italian."

641
00:57:41.681 --> 00:57:44.182
Don't make me sound
like a beatnik.

642
00:57:44.284 --> 00:57:45.817
You read French books.

643
00:57:49.492 --> 00:57:51.724
What happened between
us in the war happened.

644
00:57:52.291 --> 00:57:53.898
As with many.

645
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.662
And sometimes I wish it didn't.

646
00:57:59.068 --> 00:58:00.568
How can you say that?

647
00:58:01.437 --> 00:58:03.608
Because if I was a
woman like I am now,

648
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:05.002
not 12 years ago,

649
00:58:05.104 --> 00:58:07.905
I would not have interfered
in another woman's marriage.

650
00:58:10.345 --> 00:58:12.415
And now she's lost a child.

651
00:58:13.548 --> 00:58:15.648
But the present is
what the present is.

652
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:19.917
And in our world here,
between me and you and Piero,

653
00:58:21.388 --> 00:58:23.789
what is best for Piero?

654
00:58:25.864 --> 00:58:27.595
Who speaks for him?

655
00:58:32.365 --> 00:58:33.898
You're his father.

656
00:58:38.405 --> 00:58:40.872
How do we reconcile this?

657
00:58:41.846 --> 00:58:43.413
I don't know.

658
00:58:45.379 --> 00:58:47.384
But that makes it no less.

659
00:59:12.273 --> 00:59:14.009
Aren't you coming?

660
00:59:14.111 --> 00:59:16.677
No. Make an excuse for me.

661
00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:19.284
The cash for Cecilia?

662
00:59:19.985 --> 00:59:21.649
Brown envelope by the door.

663
01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:15.138
What's this I hear about you
looking for outside investors?

664
01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.771
Fangio eating up all your money?

665
01:00:16.873 --> 01:00:20.243
No. With television, it's
going to become big business.

666
01:00:20.345 --> 01:00:22.512
To do this, one has
to be capitalized.

667
01:00:23.675 --> 01:00:25.441
The game is changing, Enzo.

668
01:00:25.543 --> 01:00:29.013
And this outside capital will magically
bestow its favors upon Maserati.

669
01:00:29.115 --> 01:00:32.115
Of course. After we
win the Mille Miglia.

670
01:03:48.383 --> 01:03:49.686
I'm pregnant.

671
01:04:32.591 --> 01:04:34.861
<i>Hawthorn is third,
Fangio and Collins...</i>

672
01:04:34.963 --> 01:04:36.663
Where is everybody?

673
01:04:36.765 --> 01:04:38.196
I gave them the day off.

674
01:04:38.298 --> 01:04:40.334
No wonder you're so
late with everything.

675
01:04:40.436 --> 01:04:42.232
Enzo, it's Sunday.

676
01:04:42.334 --> 01:04:44.534
My men work weekends all
through the year for you.

677
01:04:46.374 --> 01:04:48.814
Their children haven't seen them
since the day they were born.

678
01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:53.278
That's very sad. Here's to you and that
pack of color-blind louts you employ.

679
01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.849
<i>De Portago is slowing down,
having overshot on the braking.</i>

680
01:04:56.951 --> 01:04:59.749
<i>Mrs. Vanderbilt and
Cooper watch excitedly</i>

681
01:04:59.851 --> 01:05:04.761
<i>as Lewis-Evans goes through in the
straight followed by Musso's Ferrari.</i>

682
01:05:04.863 --> 01:05:08.898
<i>Vanwall leads the race,
averaging 120 miles per hour.</i>

683
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.962
<i>Musso makes his tires smoke
as he strains all his nerves</i>

684
01:05:13.065 --> 01:05:15.105
<i>to try and close down the gap.</i>

685
01:05:15.207 --> 01:05:18.509
<i>We got word of a collision between
the BRM and the Cooper-Climax.</i>

686
01:05:18.611 --> 01:05:22.273
<i>Oh! There is a lot of
smoke, making it very...</i>

687
01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.899
What is <i>problema?</i>

688
01:05:51.343 --> 01:05:53.707
Oh, no.

689
01:05:53.809 --> 01:05:55.405
Is she operable?
Ah, that's bad.

690
01:05:56.776 --> 01:05:58.243
Bad, bad. Very bad.

691
01:06:08.624 --> 01:06:14.624
<i>With three laps to go, after Fangio,
Musso, it's Behra and de Portago.</i>

692
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.097
<i>He's trying all he
knows to close the gap.</i>

693
01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:30.979
<i>De Portago! And
he brakes first!</i>

694
01:06:48.025 --> 01:06:49.393
Call in de Portago.

695
01:06:52.271 --> 01:06:53.364
Hurry up. Hurry up.

696
01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:06.876
Fon. Fon.

697
01:07:06.978 --> 01:07:08.683
What? Out.

698
01:07:08.785 --> 01:07:11.250
What? Out! Peter's
taking over.

699
01:07:14.821 --> 01:07:16.321
Thank you, old bean.

700
01:07:18.593 --> 01:07:20.930
Go, go, go!

701
01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:26.265
What happened?

702
01:07:34.776 --> 01:07:36.275
I could have taken him.

703
01:07:37.209 --> 01:07:38.948
<i>You lack commitment.</i>

704
01:07:43.147 --> 01:07:45.086
Look at the Maserati team.

705
01:07:46.224 --> 01:07:47.418
Fangio.

706
01:07:47.852 --> 01:07:49.123
Behra.

707
01:07:50.262 --> 01:07:51.829
Stirling Moss.

708
01:07:52.726 --> 01:07:54.392
Hard-nosed pros.

709
01:07:55.866 --> 01:07:59.430
Men with a brutal
determination to win.

710
01:08:02.104 --> 01:08:04.908
With a cruel emptiness
in their stomachs.

711
01:08:05.739 --> 01:08:07.240
Detachment.

712
01:08:08.273 --> 01:08:10.941
Loyal to one thing...
not the team.

713
01:08:11.043 --> 01:08:13.114
Loyal to their lust to win.

714
01:08:14.582 --> 01:08:16.183
It rains.

715
01:08:16.285 --> 01:08:19.817
The track is slippery with
oil, an evil-handling car.

716
01:08:19.919 --> 01:08:21.621
Will they falter? No.

717
01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:23.322
My spring team.

718
01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.627
Courageous? Skillful? Yes.

719
01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:29.361
Recently in school.

720
01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:35.268
Aristocrats, straight
from <i>Almanach de Gotha.</i>

721
01:08:36.575 --> 01:08:39.437
Gentlemen sportsmen.
Very nice.

722
01:08:42.146 --> 01:08:44.713
On the straight into the
tight corner at Nouveau Monde,

723
01:08:44.815 --> 01:08:46.677
there's only one
line through it.

724
01:08:47.347 --> 01:08:50.682
Behra pulls up next
to you, challenging.

725
01:08:50.784 --> 01:08:52.719
You're even.

726
01:08:52.821 --> 01:08:56.993
But two objects cannot occupy the same
point in space at the same moment in time.

727
01:08:57.628 --> 01:08:59.759
Behra doesn't lift.

728
01:08:59.861 --> 01:09:02.028
The corner races at you.

729
01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:04.568
You have perhaps a
crisis of identity:

730
01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:07.169
"Am I a sportsman
or a competitor?"

731
01:09:07.271 --> 01:09:10.571
"How will the French think of
me if I run Behra into a tree?"

732
01:09:10.673 --> 01:09:13.277
You lift, he passes.

733
01:09:13.379 --> 01:09:15.341
He won, you lose!

734
01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:24.449
Because at that same moment Behra
thought, "Fuck it, we both die."

735
01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:32.863
Make no mistake, all of us
are racers... or have been.

736
01:09:32.965 --> 01:09:36.066
We all are certain, "It
will never happen to me."

737
01:09:36.168 --> 01:09:40.196
Then my friend is killed. I give
up racing forever on Monday.

738
01:09:40.298 --> 01:09:42.302
I'm back racing by Sunday.

739
01:09:43.875 --> 01:09:46.108
We all know it's
our deadly passion.

740
01:09:50.416 --> 01:09:52.015
Our terrible joy.

741
01:09:56.986 --> 01:09:58.921
But if you get into
one of my cars...

742
01:09:59.023 --> 01:10:01.721
and no one is forcing
you to take that seat...

743
01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:03.422
you get in to win.

744
01:10:06.728 --> 01:10:07.998
Brake later.

745
01:10:09.996 --> 01:10:11.628
Steal their line.

746
01:10:16.169 --> 01:10:18.338
Make them make the mistake.

747
01:10:36.925 --> 01:10:38.689
I would have taken him.

748
01:10:38.791 --> 01:10:40.228
Behra.

749
01:10:50.108 --> 01:10:52.302
I'm changing the lineup
for the Mille Miglia.

750
01:10:52.404 --> 01:10:54.608
I want you and
Olivier to swap cars.

751
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:58.148
He'll drive the little coupe and
you'll take one of the 335's.

752
01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.580
You're giving me one of the
most powerful cars in the race.

753
01:11:00.683 --> 01:11:04.747
Well, put it another way: I'm
giving Olivier the more agile coupe.

754
01:11:05.655 --> 01:11:06.984
Won't he mind?

755
01:11:07.753 --> 01:11:10.390
Well, of course he will,
but he'll beat you anyway.

756
01:11:17.802 --> 01:11:19.565
This is the power of attorney

757
01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:22.567
which Signor Ferrari requested
that you put your name on.

758
01:11:23.134 --> 01:11:25.573
And the check

759
01:11:25.675 --> 01:11:28.012
for $500,000.

760
01:11:30.847 --> 01:11:32.346
It has not been signed.

761
01:11:35.016 --> 01:11:41.016
The signing of these affidavits was
conditional on the exchange of the check.

762
01:11:41.287 --> 01:11:42.855
I'm sure it was an oversight.

763
01:11:42.957 --> 01:11:44.754
Bullshit, Cosetti.

764
01:11:47.158 --> 01:11:48.530
Go away, please.

765
01:11:48.632 --> 01:11:49.660
Give me a pen.

766
01:12:23.897 --> 01:12:25.168
Excellent.

767
01:12:31.572 --> 01:12:35.772
I'll hold on to these until
I get my check signed.

768
01:12:40.649 --> 01:12:41.914
And...

769
01:12:42.917 --> 01:12:48.358
I want information about special
payments made by the factory last year.

770
01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:49.852
To whom?

771
01:12:51.024 --> 01:12:53.097
Lina Lardi.

772
01:12:55.193 --> 01:12:56.860
Lina Lardi.

773
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:59.103
I want to know
how much they are.

774
01:12:59.205 --> 01:13:02.271
I want to know for how
long they've been going on.

775
01:13:19.787 --> 01:13:20.622
Yes.

776
01:13:20.724 --> 01:13:21.724
<i>Enzo.</i>

777
01:13:21.824 --> 01:13:23.655
Lina Lardi.

778
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:26.625
What does that name mean to you?

779
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:32.797
<i>The boy is yours?</i>

780
01:13:32.899 --> 01:13:34.138
Yes.

781
01:13:43.277 --> 01:13:44.907
I need to think about this.

782
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.644
She found out.

783
01:14:19.784 --> 01:14:21.878
The boy? That too.

784
01:14:24.888 --> 01:14:26.918
So what do you think?

785
01:14:27.554 --> 01:14:29.287
The driver in front
will piss his pants

786
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:31.327
when he sees it in his mirror.

787
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:34.563
And when it passes,

788
01:14:35.266 --> 01:14:37.861
it has an ass on it
like a Canova sculpture.

789
01:14:39.165 --> 01:14:40.671
So what do I do?

790
01:14:40.773 --> 01:14:42.505
What do you want to do?

791
01:14:42.607 --> 01:14:43.638
Leave her.

792
01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.803
So, do it.

793
01:14:49.079 --> 01:14:51.314
You see that pigeon up there?

794
01:14:52.878 --> 01:14:56.546
I left its door open,
but it won't come out.

795
01:14:56.648 --> 01:14:58.582
It's forgotten what freedom is.

796
01:14:58.684 --> 01:15:01.225
Freedom for that
pigeon is pigeon pie.

797
01:15:08.529 --> 01:15:11.868
Tell Laura that you
two should live apart,

798
01:15:11.971 --> 01:15:13.730
you are going to live with Lina,

799
01:15:13.832 --> 01:15:15.632
and that you are going
to recognize the boy.

800
01:15:15.734 --> 01:15:18.100
Everybody thinks that
you should anyway.

801
01:15:18.202 --> 01:15:21.278
I don't give a damn what everybody
thinks. What do you think?

802
01:15:24.912 --> 01:15:28.285
There are a lot of people on
your payroll with families.

803
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:32.685
Ferrari needs continuity
to stay Ferrari.

804
01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:56.511
We have history.

805
01:16:07.457 --> 01:16:09.656
Stay there, pigeon,
or you're dead meat.

806
01:16:22.768 --> 01:16:25.540
The whole of Emilia
knows, but not me?

807
01:16:29.114 --> 01:16:31.509
I thought it would
break your heart.

808
01:16:31.611 --> 01:16:33.977
You broke my heart
years ago, Enzo.

809
01:16:39.022 --> 01:16:40.588
When did it start?

810
01:16:42.023 --> 01:16:43.185
The war.

811
01:16:43.788 --> 01:16:45.989
The factory had
been bombed twice.

812
01:16:47.495 --> 01:16:49.363
Uh, it began during
the worst of it.

813
01:16:49.465 --> 01:16:52.264
She worked at
Carrozzeria Orlandi.

814
01:16:52.366 --> 01:16:55.900
You and Dino were in the hills that
year, and by Christmas she was pregnant.

815
01:16:57.068 --> 01:16:59.937
So I bought Castelvetro
and she went to live there.

816
01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:04.711
Is she different
from the others?

817
01:17:09.086 --> 01:17:10.783
I was in love with her.

818
01:17:12.791 --> 01:17:14.358
And I still am.

819
01:17:19.626 --> 01:17:22.658
I find myself
sharing my whole life

820
01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.995
with a woman I have never met.

821
01:17:31.504 --> 01:17:33.906
It makes a mockery of you

822
01:17:34.509 --> 01:17:37.513
in the years when
our son was ill.

823
01:17:38.444 --> 01:17:39.713
When he was dying.

824
01:17:40.413 --> 01:17:41.979
How can you say that?

825
01:17:43.348 --> 01:17:44.584
That boy,

826
01:17:44.686 --> 01:17:47.824
is he going to inherit
our factory, our name?

827
01:17:48.493 --> 01:17:50.860
'Cause I don't want
him to. We have a son.

828
01:17:50.962 --> 01:17:52.759
One son, two sons.

829
01:17:53.259 --> 01:17:54.523
Five sons.

830
01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:56.599
I miss Dino any less?

831
01:17:57.302 --> 01:17:59.335
Every morning I see
him in the cemetery.

832
01:17:59.438 --> 01:18:02.500
The hospital he died in
is funded in his name.

833
01:18:02.603 --> 01:18:04.435
A school was built in his honor!

834
01:18:04.537 --> 01:18:06.372
Honor? Who gives a shit?

835
01:18:06.474 --> 01:18:08.170
You were supposed to save him!

836
01:18:09.113 --> 01:18:10.272
You blame me for his death?

837
01:18:10.374 --> 01:18:11.710
Yes!

838
01:18:11.812 --> 01:18:14.077
Yes, because you promised
me he wouldn't die!

839
01:18:14.886 --> 01:18:16.215
Everything.

840
01:18:16.317 --> 01:18:17.748
I did everything.

841
01:18:17.850 --> 01:18:20.022
Tables showing what
calories he could eat.

842
01:18:20.124 --> 01:18:21.756
What went in, what came out.

843
01:18:21.858 --> 01:18:25.957
I graphed the degrees of
albuminuria, the degrees of azotemia!

844
01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:27.860
Diuresis!

845
01:18:27.962 --> 01:18:30.632
I know more about nephritis
and dystrophy than cars!

846
01:18:30.734 --> 01:18:33.596
Yes, I blame you! I blame
you 'cause you let him die.

847
01:18:33.698 --> 01:18:35.901
The father deluded himself!

848
01:18:37.371 --> 01:18:39.505
The great engineer!

849
01:18:39.607 --> 01:18:41.874
"I will restore
my son to health."

850
01:18:41.976 --> 01:18:45.913
Swiss doctors, Italian
doctors. Bullshit. I could not.

851
01:18:46.015 --> 01:18:47.576
I did not!

852
01:18:47.678 --> 01:18:50.952
'Cause you were so consoled at
Castelvetro, you lost your attention.

853
01:18:51.054 --> 01:18:54.851
You had another boy growing stronger
while Dino was getting weaker!

854
01:18:54.953 --> 01:18:57.960
What goes on in your
mind? He got sick.

855
01:18:58.062 --> 01:19:00.589
Dystrophy. Kidneys!

856
01:19:00.691 --> 01:19:02.931
It destroyed him!

857
01:19:03.033 --> 01:19:04.033
It destroyed us.

858
01:19:04.068 --> 01:19:05.335
What do you care? Huh?

859
01:19:05.437 --> 01:19:07.007
You have another son!
You have another wife!

860
01:19:07.031 --> 01:19:10.903
She's not my wife.
But he is my son.

861
01:19:15.473 --> 01:19:16.744
Move out.

862
01:19:30.655 --> 01:19:36.093
These are the papers. They give you
power to negotiate on my behalf.

863
01:19:38.799 --> 01:19:41.336
And there is a problem
with your check.

864
01:19:41.438 --> 01:19:43.903
You forgot to put
your name on it.

865
01:19:51.378 --> 01:19:53.110
We are partners.

866
01:19:54.286 --> 01:19:56.553
This is a gun
pointed at our head.

867
01:19:59.483 --> 01:20:04.025
You cash it before I conclude
the deal, Ferrari is no more.

868
01:20:04.127 --> 01:20:05.694
That's right.

869
01:20:23.247 --> 01:20:24.581
It's done.

870
01:20:25.411 --> 01:20:26.748
She knows.

871
01:20:38.823 --> 01:20:40.663
You'll come to Modena.

872
01:20:41.261 --> 01:20:42.599
What?

873
01:20:43.033 --> 01:20:44.062
Why not?

874
01:20:44.829 --> 01:20:46.401
Modena is where I live.

875
01:20:46.503 --> 01:20:49.771
It's not me. It's about Piero.

876
01:20:50.834 --> 01:20:52.807
Does he sneak around?

877
01:20:53.406 --> 01:20:54.809
As whom?

878
01:20:57.446 --> 01:20:59.313
She knows he is our boy?

879
01:20:59.415 --> 01:21:01.915
She knows he is my son.

880
01:21:03.585 --> 01:21:05.985
But nothing has been resolved.

881
01:21:08.552 --> 01:21:09.791
Yeah.

882
01:21:25.638 --> 01:21:27.139
Hey, Papa!

883
01:21:27.575 --> 01:21:29.243
De Portago's autograph.

884
01:21:29.345 --> 01:21:30.912
You go back to sleep.

885
01:21:31.014 --> 01:21:32.341
Papa!

886
01:21:33.781 --> 01:21:36.811
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!

887
01:21:36.913 --> 01:21:40.149
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!

888
01:21:40.251 --> 01:21:45.158
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!

889
01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:48.491
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!

890
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:29.772
Signor Ferrari.
<i>Commendatore</i> Ferrari!

891
01:22:31.309 --> 01:22:32.636
Mr. Ferrari!

892
01:22:39.684 --> 01:22:42.246
- Ferrari!
- He's here.

893
01:22:43.046 --> 01:22:44.554
Peter. How are you doing?

894
01:22:44.656 --> 01:22:46.815
Okay, here we go. Come
here. Come this way.

895
01:22:46.917 --> 01:22:48.386
This is Peter Collins.

896
01:22:52.096 --> 01:22:53.391
All right.

897
01:22:53.494 --> 01:22:54.731
Let's go.

898
01:22:57.199 --> 01:23:00.903
This is my new friend, de
Portago, our newest driver.

899
01:23:01.005 --> 01:23:02.035
Okay.

900
01:23:05.672 --> 01:23:07.508
Good luck, gentlemen.

901
01:23:07.611 --> 01:23:09.378
Good afternoon, <i>Commendatore.</i>

902
01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.880
Registration forms, licenses.

903
01:23:15.485 --> 01:23:16.951
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

904
01:23:19.818 --> 01:23:22.254
Good afternoon, Orsi.

905
01:23:22.723 --> 01:23:24.354
Good afternoon, Ferrari.

906
01:23:26.595 --> 01:23:28.126
I'm entering five cars.

907
01:23:28.228 --> 01:23:32.868
Collins, Taruffi, de Portago,
von Trips, Gendebien.

908
01:23:50.182 --> 01:23:51.718
Are you making them richer?

909
01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:53.482
Yes, for the humidity.

910
01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:58.086
No sleeping. Especially you.

911
01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:11.073
Good evening, <i>Commendatore.</i>
And to you, my friend.

912
01:24:11.175 --> 01:24:14.207
<i>Of the smallest of
the racing cars.</i>

913
01:24:14.309 --> 01:24:17.140
<i>Painted on each of the cars
is the time of its departure.</i>

914
01:24:17.242 --> 01:24:19.280
No, judges should be at Ravenna.

915
01:24:19.382 --> 01:24:20.817
Okay.

916
01:24:23.014 --> 01:24:26.552
Make sure they show these at every
control. Otherwise they're disqualified.

917
01:24:26.654 --> 01:24:30.355
<i>I'm honored to have at my
side the owner of Maserati,</i>

918
01:24:30.824 --> 01:24:32.927
Cavaliere <i>Adolfo Orsi.</i>

919
01:24:33.029 --> 01:24:35.997
All right, I have a few
last-minute instructions.

920
01:24:37.564 --> 01:24:39.065
Refueling.

921
01:24:39.167 --> 01:24:42.568
Remind the mechanics the
gas is to go into the tanks,

922
01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:44.037
not on the drivers.

923
01:24:44.139 --> 01:24:47.206
Especially Taruffi. I prefer
he not go up in flames.

924
01:25:27.719 --> 01:25:30.480
I'm writing to
Linda. What do I say?

925
01:25:32.052 --> 01:25:34.418
I don't know. Um...

926
01:25:54.876 --> 01:25:56.373
<i>My darling Louise.</i>

927
01:25:56.475 --> 01:25:59.575
<i>The same letter I write
before every race.</i>

928
01:25:59.677 --> 01:26:03.185
<i>I have no worry for myself
in this race, as ever.</i>

929
01:26:03.287 --> 01:26:06.848
<i>My only fear is that you will
need me and I won't be here.</i>

930
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:12.423
<i>In that unlikely eventuality,
know you have all my love always.</i>

931
01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.273
Remember what I told you.

932
01:27:05.376 --> 01:27:08.814
Get behind Taruffi and Collins.

933
01:27:08.916 --> 01:27:10.782
Okay? They know the way.

934
01:27:10.884 --> 01:27:14.983
If you can hang on to them till you
reach Bologna, you're in with a chance.

935
01:27:15.085 --> 01:27:16.421
One last thing.

936
01:27:26.131 --> 01:27:28.035
Can you autograph this?

937
01:27:28.137 --> 01:27:31.073
It's for a very, very
special young man.

938
01:27:31.641 --> 01:27:32.701
What's his name?

939
01:27:33.409 --> 01:27:34.472
Piero.

940
01:27:35.279 --> 01:27:36.279
Piero!

941
01:27:37.007 --> 01:27:40.280
P-I-E-R-O.

942
01:27:41.181 --> 01:27:43.485
If Moss and Behra
attempt to pass,

943
01:27:43.587 --> 01:27:45.150
wave them through.

944
01:27:45.252 --> 01:27:48.024
Your job is to get
round in one piece.

945
01:27:48.691 --> 01:27:50.325
See you in Bologna!

946
01:27:50.427 --> 01:27:51.427
Good luck.

947
01:27:53.224 --> 01:27:55.364
Ready? Go.

948
01:27:59.966 --> 01:28:02.801
- Good morning, Peter.
- And it's going to be a good one.

949
01:28:02.903 --> 01:28:04.638
This car can win.

950
01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:07.120
Once you're over the mountains,
you've got the legs on the others.

951
01:28:07.144 --> 01:28:10.142
Then it's either you or
de Portago, understand?

952
01:28:10.244 --> 01:28:11.907
Are you forgetting
about Moss and Behra?

953
01:28:12.009 --> 01:28:15.381
Watch out for stray dogs and
children. They're the real danger.

954
01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.582
All right.

955
01:28:28.096 --> 01:28:30.261
Here you are. Ah, <i>si.</i>

956
01:28:30.363 --> 01:28:33.870
You can win this one, Taruffi, if you don't
smoke yourself to death before it's over.

957
01:28:33.972 --> 01:28:35.731
What's the weather
like on the Futa Pass?

958
01:28:36.266 --> 01:28:37.466
Good. Maybe rain.

959
01:28:37.568 --> 01:28:39.907
Listen to me. You
need this race.

960
01:28:40.009 --> 01:28:41.774
How can you tell
your grandchildren

961
01:28:41.876 --> 01:28:45.274
that you picked up every trophy in
Europe but you've never won at Brescia?

962
01:28:45.376 --> 01:28:46.882
Make sure I get the backup.

963
01:28:46.984 --> 01:28:49.885
No foul-ups. Especially
at the fuel stops.

964
01:28:49.987 --> 01:28:51.651
All right, that's the spirit.

965
01:28:59.324 --> 01:29:01.426
Stirling, are we all set? Yes.

966
01:29:01.528 --> 01:29:05.465
Take the lead right away
and stay in front. Sure.

967
01:29:05.567 --> 01:29:06.762
Great.

968
01:29:14.576 --> 01:29:15.778
Jean,

969
01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:18.940
you stay back
behind the Ferraris.

970
01:29:19.042 --> 01:29:20.179
Wait.

971
01:29:20.281 --> 01:29:22.816
Some will break,
eliminate themselves.

972
01:29:22.918 --> 01:29:25.520
Then attack before Bologna.

973
01:29:25.622 --> 01:29:26.622
Okay? Okay.

974
01:29:57.247 --> 01:29:58.616
Good to see you.

975
01:30:03.993 --> 01:30:05.824
For once he did not complain.

976
01:30:49.939 --> 01:30:51.507
Do you know the way ahead?

977
01:30:51.609 --> 01:30:52.769
I'm not sure.

978
01:31:37.253 --> 01:31:39.519
Okay, let's see what she can do.

979
01:31:55.299 --> 01:31:56.833
Let him go, Fon.

980
01:32:47.157 --> 01:32:49.655
No brakes. Bloody
pedal snapped off!

981
01:32:51.756 --> 01:32:53.626
Let's get this bugger home.

982
01:32:57.699 --> 01:32:59.660
<i>The first car into
Ravenna this morning</i>

983
01:32:59.762 --> 01:33:01.731
<i>was Peter Collins's Ferrari</i>

984
01:33:01.834 --> 01:33:07.171
<i>and a Fiat 500 timed at
140 on the final section.</i>

985
01:33:07.273 --> 01:33:08.839
Magi, it's Ferrari.

986
01:33:32.297 --> 01:33:33.666
Moss is out.

987
01:34:10.039 --> 01:34:11.506
On this, straight.

988
01:34:48.505 --> 01:34:49.808
What's next?

989
01:35:12.133 --> 01:35:13.567
<i>Commendatore?</i>

990
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:15.470
<i>Avvocato</i> Agnelli's on
the phone. All right.

991
01:35:15.572 --> 01:35:18.474
Uh, sit down, gentlemen.
Excuse me for one moment.

992
01:35:28.984 --> 01:35:30.378
<i>Avvocato.</i>

993
01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:33.615
I apologize for calling in the
middle of the race, Ferrari.

994
01:35:33.717 --> 01:35:38.389
But I have this article by Rancati in
front of me that is, uh, so disturbing.

995
01:35:38.491 --> 01:35:40.122
<i>Avvocato,</i> it's fiction.

996
01:35:40.224 --> 01:35:43.565
I have absolutely no idea
where they get their stories.

997
01:35:47.334 --> 01:35:49.104
This is important.

998
01:35:49.207 --> 01:35:51.138
Ferrari cannot go to foreigners.

999
01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.275
You are a national treasure.

1000
01:35:53.377 --> 01:35:56.041
<i>A "jewel in the crown of Italy."</i>

1001
01:35:56.143 --> 01:35:57.279
Exactly.

1002
01:35:57.381 --> 01:35:59.148
Then why does the
jewel have to scrimp

1003
01:35:59.250 --> 01:36:00.646
to put its cars into every race?

1004
01:36:00.748 --> 01:36:03.314
If it's that bad, why
didn't you call me?

1005
01:36:03.416 --> 01:36:05.213
I did. You said no.

1006
01:36:06.783 --> 01:36:08.989
Impossible. When was this?

1007
01:36:09.091 --> 01:36:11.388
1917. <i>Stop it.</i>

1008
01:36:11.490 --> 01:36:13.094
You were a child.

1009
01:36:13.196 --> 01:36:15.197
I was 19. I needed a job.

1010
01:36:15.299 --> 01:36:17.132
A secretary came
back with a card.

1011
01:36:17.234 --> 01:36:18.897
One word written on it: "No."

1012
01:36:19.631 --> 01:36:21.599
That was a long time ago.

1013
01:36:21.701 --> 01:36:24.234
In business, each
day is a new day.

1014
01:36:24.937 --> 01:36:28.610
Well, the personality
of Fiat is timeless.

1015
01:36:28.712 --> 01:36:30.876
The offer you would make me
will be full of conditions.

1016
01:36:30.978 --> 01:36:33.774
<i>That is not so.</i> My bosses
will be bookkeepers in Turin.

1017
01:36:33.876 --> 01:36:35.476
<i>We should talk this over.</i>

1018
01:36:36.179 --> 01:36:38.987
If you're looking for
financial assistance,

1019
01:36:39.089 --> 01:36:40.855
talk to me, please.

1020
01:36:40.957 --> 01:36:42.118
Not Ford.

1021
01:36:43.027 --> 01:36:44.924
You're busy now.

1022
01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:48.462
<i>Call me after the Mille Miglia.</i>

1023
01:36:48.564 --> 01:36:50.632
I'll call you first
thing tomorrow.

1024
01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:59.542
Okay.

1025
01:37:26.634 --> 01:37:28.098
Yup?

1026
01:38:08.809 --> 01:38:11.080
When you get to Bologna,
change the rubber.

1027
01:38:11.182 --> 01:38:13.045
I will call ahead. Hi.

1028
01:38:13.147 --> 01:38:14.377
Hey.

1029
01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.017
Meet me in Brescia. I
can't. I have a camera test.

1030
01:38:19.717 --> 01:38:21.316
I am going to win.

1031
01:38:23.359 --> 01:38:24.792
I want you to be there.

1032
01:41:28.544 --> 01:41:29.878
Took a shortcut?

1033
01:41:30.645 --> 01:41:32.177
Yeah. Come on.

1034
01:41:50.463 --> 01:41:51.493
Hey.

1035
01:42:04.713 --> 01:42:06.244
Your keys?

1036
01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:11.084
Oh, <i>grazie. Grazie.</i>

1037
01:42:17.426 --> 01:42:19.059
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

1038
01:42:32.773 --> 01:42:34.576
How much time do you have?

1039
01:42:34.678 --> 01:42:36.406
First cars arrive
in about an hour.

1040
01:42:37.513 --> 01:42:38.739
About half past 2:00.

1041
01:42:38.841 --> 01:42:40.080
Mmm.

1042
01:43:07.207 --> 01:43:09.945
Everything okay? No, the
transmission is gone.

1043
01:43:10.047 --> 01:43:12.110
I don't know if it's the
gears or the rear axle,

1044
01:43:12.213 --> 01:43:14.778
but the bloody thing's
buggered either way.

1045
01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:15.946
Who's behind me?

1046
01:43:16.049 --> 01:43:18.683
Everyone. You're in the lead.

1047
01:43:18.785 --> 01:43:20.784
What about Moss? Out.

1048
01:43:20.886 --> 01:43:22.218
When? Before Padua.

1049
01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:24.520
Why didn't you tell me?

1050
01:43:25.355 --> 01:43:27.490
It was Moss I was worried about.

1051
01:43:28.297 --> 01:43:29.529
Well,

1052
01:43:30.399 --> 01:43:33.199
I've fucked the bloody
transmission up now, haven't I?

1053
01:43:35.871 --> 01:43:38.402
Kid, you want Collins's banana?

1054
01:43:41.074 --> 01:43:43.806
Peter, you can do
it. Take it easy.

1055
01:44:04.735 --> 01:44:06.962
Thank you very
much. Best of luck.

1056
01:44:07.064 --> 01:44:08.300
Thank you.

1057
01:44:09.399 --> 01:44:11.800
Taruffi, I gave you
a brand-new car.

1058
01:44:11.903 --> 01:44:12.903
Look at it!

1059
01:44:12.971 --> 01:44:14.602
The rear axle is bent.

1060
01:44:14.704 --> 01:44:18.013
I only have the first,
third and the fourth gear.

1061
01:44:27.219 --> 01:44:30.087
What happened? I
went off. Futa Pass.

1062
01:44:30.189 --> 01:44:31.988
You're a passenger in a Ferrari.

1063
01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:33.622
You should have walked!

1064
01:44:35.529 --> 01:44:37.998
All right. Any more damage...
I don't think it can make it.

1065
01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:39.999
Any more damage, Taruffi,
and you pay for it.

1066
01:44:40.101 --> 01:44:42.433
<i>Commendatore,</i> now
that Maserati's out,

1067
01:44:42.535 --> 01:44:45.136
we are in danger of running
the cars into the ground.

1068
01:44:45.238 --> 01:44:46.905
Order the drivers to
hold their positions.

1069
01:44:47.007 --> 01:44:48.802
Yeah, why bother? They won't.

1070
01:44:48.904 --> 01:44:51.542
Any problems, Olivier? You're
the head of your class.

1071
01:44:51.644 --> 01:44:53.857
- I'm going to win this outright.
- All right, and you can.

1072
01:44:53.881 --> 01:44:57.248
Collins's back axle is gone. There's
a problem with Taffy's transmission.

1073
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:59.053
That leaves Taruffi,
and he's lost a gear.

1074
01:44:59.155 --> 01:45:01.148
So it's me and de Portago.
You and de Portago.

1075
01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:03.155
Okay, let's go. Go.

1076
01:45:03.257 --> 01:45:04.987
But if we continue
at this pace...

1077
01:45:05.089 --> 01:45:08.495
For the future of the factory...
My factory is built on racing.

1078
01:45:08.597 --> 01:45:10.065
They are racers.

1079
01:45:11.865 --> 01:45:13.098
I think I can make it.

1080
01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:15.131
You better, you geriatric.

1081
01:45:15.233 --> 01:45:18.147
If you don't finish in the first three,
your wife will never speak to you again.

1082
01:45:18.171 --> 01:45:20.801
Nor your children.
Okay, go for it!

1083
01:45:26.747 --> 01:45:28.009
How is Behra?

1084
01:45:28.111 --> 01:45:29.517
He's okay.

1085
01:45:29.619 --> 01:45:30.619
He kept coming.

1086
01:45:30.646 --> 01:45:33.554
He brakes, you pass.
You brake, he passes.

1087
01:45:33.656 --> 01:45:35.256
Or no one brakes.

1088
01:45:35.358 --> 01:45:37.859
What's going on here?
- You need new rubber.

1089
01:45:37.961 --> 01:45:39.591
I don't have time.
Check the pressures.

1090
01:45:39.693 --> 01:45:42.168
Chiti, check the tires. Nelson,
did you check the front offside?

1091
01:45:42.192 --> 01:45:43.461
Yes. It's okay.

1092
01:45:44.495 --> 01:45:45.999
We're wasting time,
Ferrari. Come on!

1093
01:45:46.101 --> 01:45:47.496
Chiti, check the front offside.

1094
01:45:47.599 --> 01:45:49.202
- Come on, they're good.
- Chiti!

1095
01:45:49.304 --> 01:45:51.568
They're worn. Will
it get us to Brescia?

1096
01:45:52.434 --> 01:45:54.076
Will it get us to Brescia?

1097
01:45:58.142 --> 01:45:59.807
Go, go! Hurry up!

1098
01:46:09.556 --> 01:46:13.253
Eh, eh, Laura!
Signora! Laura, please?

1099
01:46:13.355 --> 01:46:15.430
Laura, please. Please.

1100
01:46:15.532 --> 01:46:16.590
Laura, please?

1101
01:46:16.692 --> 01:46:19.629
Please, Laura. Another
one, please. Laura!

1102
01:46:19.731 --> 01:46:21.566
<i>To bring you the latest...</i>

1103
01:46:21.668 --> 01:46:24.202
<i>from the Mille Miglia, I'm
sure you are as curious as I am</i>

1104
01:46:24.304 --> 01:46:26.005
<i>to see who finished
in glory today.</i>

1105
01:46:26.107 --> 01:46:27.736
<i>Let's hear from Signor Ferra...</i>

1106
01:46:36.151 --> 01:46:37.479
<i>Signor Ferrari, who's gonna win?</i>

1107
01:46:37.581 --> 01:46:39.746
<i>It could be any
of the first five.</i>

1108
01:46:39.849 --> 01:46:42.151
<i>And what about Gendebien's 250?</i>

1109
01:46:42.253 --> 01:46:47.129
<i>He demonstrates that even the smallest
Ferrari can compete at the highest level.</i>

1110
01:46:47.231 --> 01:46:49.097
<i>May he win? Of
course he may win!</i>

1111
01:46:49.199 --> 01:46:51.529
<i>Who wants to come in second?</i>

1112
01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:55.296
You knew about her
and you never told me?

1113
01:46:55.398 --> 01:46:57.469
He is entitled to an heir.

1114
01:46:58.971 --> 01:47:00.670
I gave him one.

1115
01:47:02.705 --> 01:47:06.346
As it turns out,
one was not enough.

1116
01:47:14.584 --> 01:47:17.720
I gave him one!
I gave him one!

1117
01:48:04.706 --> 01:48:06.101
Edoardo!

1118
01:48:06.203 --> 01:48:07.671
Edoardo!

1119
01:48:12.741 --> 01:48:15.349
Edoardo, go back,
wash your hands.

1120
01:48:55.386 --> 01:48:56.786
They're coming!

1121
01:48:57.922 --> 01:49:01.095
I think this guy is
crazy about these cars.

1122
01:49:01.197 --> 01:49:03.397
He's only ever
thinking about cars.

1123
01:51:03.249 --> 01:51:04.518
Peter, hi!

1124
01:51:04.986 --> 01:51:06.149
Where is Fon?

1125
01:51:06.251 --> 01:51:07.452
I don't know.

1126
01:51:07.554 --> 01:51:10.117
He was behind me until
my car broke down.

1127
01:51:11.126 --> 01:51:12.889
He'll be here somewhere.

1128
01:51:47.626 --> 01:51:49.192
<i>Commendatore?</i>

1129
01:51:50.831 --> 01:51:54.161
<i>Maresciallo,</i> we are
here to collect the car.

1130
01:52:04.848 --> 01:52:06.243
De Portago?

1131
01:52:06.345 --> 01:52:07.878
They took him away.

1132
01:53:19.419 --> 01:53:21.050
Hello? <i>Piero.</i>

1133
01:53:21.618 --> 01:53:23.250
Yes. <i>It's Enzo.</i>

1134
01:53:23.952 --> 01:53:26.320
<i>I wanted to congratulate you.</i>

1135
01:53:26.422 --> 01:53:27.926
Mmm.

1136
01:53:28.028 --> 01:53:30.928
Well, what happened is separate
from your victory today.

1137
01:53:32.127 --> 01:53:34.096
<i>It will go into
the history books.</i>

1138
01:53:35.130 --> 01:53:37.704
<i>- Commendatore...</i>
- Good night, Piero.

1139
01:53:38.438 --> 01:53:40.806
<i>And again, I salute you.</i>

1140
01:53:48.451 --> 01:53:50.783
The police are on
their way from Rome.

1141
01:53:51.549 --> 01:53:53.016
They want the car.

1142
01:54:02.226 --> 01:54:05.698
I don't know. No, I don't
know when. I'm sorry.

1143
01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:07.965
I will tell him you called.

1144
01:54:11.102 --> 01:54:13.168
The <i>Commendatore</i>
is not available.

1145
01:54:15.477 --> 01:54:17.579
I'm sorry, he is really tied up.

1146
01:54:39.597 --> 01:54:43.099
Signor Ferrari is not available
to answer your questions.

1147
01:54:47.175 --> 01:54:48.269
<i>Commendatore.</i>

1148
01:54:52.844 --> 01:54:55.446
This wheel hit a
curb stone, a brick.

1149
01:54:55.548 --> 01:54:57.377
Something solid to cut it.

1150
01:54:58.319 --> 01:54:59.720
It wasn't the tire.

1151
01:55:15.764 --> 01:55:17.265
Lina called me.

1152
01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:21.742
She wants me to bring you there.

1153
01:55:27.710 --> 01:55:29.244
What happened?

1154
01:55:37.393 --> 01:55:39.386
We all know death is nearby.

1155
01:55:41.164 --> 01:55:42.730
No, no, no, no.

1156
01:55:43.893 --> 01:55:46.030
No, children don't know.

1157
01:55:47.534 --> 01:55:48.597
Families don't know.

1158
01:55:52.402 --> 01:55:55.369
I have to talk to those
vultures. Then drive me home?

1159
01:55:56.112 --> 01:55:57.778
Tavoni! Tommaso!

1160
01:56:01.645 --> 01:56:03.047
Enzo!

1161
01:56:07.256 --> 01:56:08.921
She cashed the check.

1162
01:56:22.498 --> 01:56:24.642
Why did you keep running
drivers on poor quality tires?

1163
01:56:24.666 --> 01:56:27.904
Did you realize that your
negligence cost the lives

1164
01:56:28.006 --> 01:56:31.679
of nine people,
including five children?

1165
01:56:31.781 --> 01:56:33.881
How do you plan to respond
to all the accusations?

1166
01:56:33.983 --> 01:56:36.718
And how do you plan to justify
the number of casualties?

1167
01:56:37.781 --> 01:56:40.054
Castelvetro? No.

1168
01:56:40.156 --> 01:56:42.123
Largo Garibaldi.

1169
01:56:42.225 --> 01:56:43.953
Phone Lina for me.

1170
01:56:44.055 --> 01:56:46.728
Tell her I'll call
maybe tomorrow.

1171
01:56:47.328 --> 01:56:48.796
I have business.

1172
01:57:07.315 --> 01:57:10.749
<i>Do you realize that your
negligence has cost the lives...</i>

1173
01:57:10.851 --> 01:57:13.616
<i>Look, if Italy is
looking for a scapegoat,</i>

1174
01:57:13.718 --> 01:57:14.882
<i>then here I am!</i>

1175
01:57:22.296 --> 01:57:23.330
No lights?

1176
01:57:23.432 --> 01:57:25.691
I have a headache.

1177
01:57:26.327 --> 01:57:28.533
The phone's been
ringing all night.

1178
01:57:28.635 --> 01:57:30.134
I took it off the hook.

1179
01:57:32.333 --> 01:57:33.768
You're in real
trouble, you know.

1180
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:35.205
To do with the tires.

1181
01:57:35.307 --> 01:57:38.676
The press is competing for
who can vilify you the most.

1182
01:57:38.778 --> 01:57:40.614
Nothing wrong with the tires.

1183
01:57:40.716 --> 01:57:42.984
He hit something. Did
you take any calls?

1184
01:57:44.684 --> 01:57:46.281
Ugolini from <i>The Gazette.</i>

1185
01:57:46.383 --> 01:57:49.252
What did you tell him? I
told him to fuck himself.

1186
01:57:50.554 --> 01:57:54.059
Then that man from <i>Autosport.</i>
I told him to fuck himself.

1187
01:57:54.791 --> 01:57:56.462
Then Agnelli.

1188
01:57:56.564 --> 01:57:57.692
Agnelli? I told him...

1189
01:57:57.794 --> 01:57:59.361
to call back.

1190
01:58:00.335 --> 01:58:01.761
Anyone else?

1191
01:58:01.863 --> 01:58:03.095
Cuoghi.

1192
01:58:03.197 --> 01:58:05.035
I told him to fuck himself,

1193
01:58:05.137 --> 01:58:07.237
then I took the phone
off the hook. Great.

1194
01:58:07.971 --> 01:58:09.643
Mama, what are you doing?

1195
01:58:09.745 --> 01:58:11.107
I'm all packed.
When do we leave?

1196
01:58:11.209 --> 01:58:13.914
We're not going anywhere.
Go back to sleep.

1197
01:58:24.088 --> 01:58:26.487
This is God's way
of punishing us.

1198
01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:28.796
Us?

1199
01:58:28.898 --> 01:58:31.729
You think he slaughtered
nine people at Guidizzolo

1200
01:58:31.831 --> 01:58:33.560
to get even with you and me?

1201
01:58:35.836 --> 01:58:37.833
I got a message from the bank.

1202
01:58:37.935 --> 01:58:39.805
You cashed the check. Mm.

1203
01:58:39.907 --> 01:58:42.209
They're calling
insolvency experts.

1204
01:58:42.311 --> 01:58:43.810
We're done.

1205
01:58:43.912 --> 01:58:46.105
The bank is getting
hysterical over nothing.

1206
01:58:46.207 --> 01:58:48.281
Nothing? You bankrupted us.

1207
01:58:48.383 --> 01:58:49.275
Enzo, stop it.

1208
01:58:49.377 --> 01:58:51.784
What good are you
doing yourself?

1209
01:58:51.886 --> 01:58:54.414
Mm, "I'm a scapegoat,
I'm a martyr."

1210
01:58:54.517 --> 01:58:57.419
Who are you? Who have you
become? St. Sebastian?

1211
01:58:57.521 --> 01:59:00.323
You stand there and let them
shoot arrows in your ass?

1212
01:59:03.665 --> 01:59:05.829
Go beat the hell out of them.

1213
01:59:05.931 --> 01:59:08.831
The writers.
Those cheap hacks.

1214
01:59:08.933 --> 01:59:10.938
Threaten them. Extort them.

1215
01:59:11.904 --> 01:59:13.806
And those still on their feet,

1216
01:59:13.908 --> 01:59:16.742
the most sanctimonious
and hypocritical,

1217
01:59:16.844 --> 01:59:19.606
those, you give them
brown envelopes.

1218
01:59:21.882 --> 01:59:24.482
And then they also will discover

1219
01:59:24.584 --> 01:59:28.414
that, "Perhaps the Sage of Maranello
has been maligned unfairly.

1220
01:59:28.516 --> 01:59:31.625
Perhaps moderation
should reassert itself

1221
01:59:31.727 --> 01:59:34.192
in the distinguished
Italian press."

1222
01:59:35.797 --> 01:59:37.558
And for that, you need the cash.

1223
01:59:51.343 --> 01:59:54.312
You thought I'd pack a
suitcase and go, right?

1224
01:59:54.714 --> 01:59:56.214
It crossed my mind.

1225
01:59:57.916 --> 01:59:59.646
It crossed my mind too.

1226
02:00:01.821 --> 02:00:02.949
You're financing this?

1227
02:00:03.051 --> 02:00:05.256
No, lending it.

1228
02:00:07.926 --> 02:00:09.524
And the conditions are?

1229
02:00:15.503 --> 02:00:17.301
No conditions.

1230
02:00:18.471 --> 02:00:20.040
Oh.

1231
02:00:20.673 --> 02:00:22.207
No conditions.

1232
02:00:25.715 --> 02:00:27.674
There was a part of you in Dino.

1233
02:00:28.913 --> 02:00:31.986
Your warmth. Your wit.

1234
02:00:32.981 --> 02:00:34.450
Your joy.

1235
02:00:35.050 --> 02:00:36.551
He had that.

1236
02:00:38.388 --> 02:00:41.358
I had that from you
in our early years.

1237
02:00:42.663 --> 02:00:44.531
But after a time,

1238
02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:49.564
I only got what was left when you came
home from the fights in the factory.

1239
02:00:51.268 --> 02:00:54.000
The ambition, the
drive, the plots.

1240
02:00:54.102 --> 02:00:55.702
The paranoia.

1241
02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:58.942
Even our fucking.

1242
02:00:59.044 --> 02:01:01.015
As if that could save Dino.

1243
02:01:05.415 --> 02:01:08.748
What I loved in you
I also found in him.

1244
02:01:15.157 --> 02:01:16.723
All that's gone.

1245
02:01:24.368 --> 02:01:26.537
There is no condition.
You have the money.

1246
02:01:31.008 --> 02:01:33.047
But it is my wish...

1247
02:01:35.046 --> 02:01:37.684
for my grief for our son,

1248
02:01:37.786 --> 02:01:40.153
for the years building this...

1249
02:01:42.722 --> 02:01:48.623
you do not acknowledge the boy with
the name Ferrari while I am alive.

1250
02:02:55.323 --> 02:02:57.131
How'd you get here?

1251
02:02:58.229 --> 02:02:59.663
I came with Giuseppe.

1252
02:02:59.765 --> 02:03:01.630
Giuseppe?

1253
02:03:04.867 --> 02:03:07.768
Your mother sent him because
she wants me to come home.

1254
02:03:14.049 --> 02:03:16.183
You haven't been here
before, have you?

1255
02:03:16.649 --> 02:03:17.844
No.

1256
02:03:20.414 --> 02:03:21.816
Do you know something?

1257
02:03:21.918 --> 02:03:23.124
Hmm?

1258
02:03:23.659 --> 02:03:25.387
Your mother and you

1259
02:03:25.489 --> 02:03:27.657
are going to come live
with me in Modena.

1260
02:03:27.759 --> 02:03:29.058
Papa.

1261
02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:30.892
Is the TV reception better?

1262
02:03:33.098 --> 02:03:35.001
Much better.

1263
02:03:35.103 --> 02:03:36.629
You can see the
tower from my window.

1264
02:03:36.731 --> 02:03:39.140
Did you get de
Portago's autograph?

1265
02:03:41.841 --> 02:03:43.408
I did.

1266
02:03:45.777 --> 02:03:46.840
Come.

1267
02:03:51.614 --> 02:03:54.155
I'll introduce you
to your brother Dino.

1268
02:03:55.221 --> 02:03:57.356
I wish you could have known him.

1269
02:03:59.392 --> 02:04:01.756
He would have taken you
with him everywhere.
