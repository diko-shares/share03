1
00:06:02.196 --> 00:06:03.197
Yes?

2
00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:05.199
Please inform
Signor Ferrari

3
00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:09.203
<i>that the Maserati driver</i>
<i>Jean Behra has just arrived</i>
<i>from Milan.</i>

4
00:06:09.303 --> 00:06:10.671
Hmm. Thank you.

5
00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:13.908
Thank you, most excellent
and gracious signora.

6
00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:40.467
Yes?

7
00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:42.937
<i>Laura. It's Chiti. Is he there?</i>

8
00:06:43.037 --> 00:06:44.505
He's taking a shower.

9
00:06:44.605 --> 00:06:48.142
Give him a message, please.
Jean Behra is in town.

10
00:06:56.951 --> 00:06:58.019
How are you?

11
00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:22.677
Signor Ferrari?

12
00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:24.679
Signor Ferrari!

13
00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:26.614
May I present myself?

14
00:07:26.714 --> 00:07:28.783
I am Alfonso de Portago.

15
00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.632
Wow.

16
00:07:56.444 --> 00:07:58.212
It's Ferrari.

17
00:07:59.914 --> 00:08:03.417
Good morning, Enzo!
Your friends are back.

18
00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:05.920
This time, I hope in tune.

19
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.789
More in tune
than your cars in Monaco
last week.

20
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.059
Enzo! We have to talk.

21
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.428
That bad?

22
00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:16.130
I will come by later.

23
00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:49.163
Yes.

24
00:08:49.263 --> 00:08:50.564
<i>Behra is here.</i>

25
00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:52.299
<i>The Orsi brothers</i>
<i>collected him at the station.</i>

26
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.035
<i>Did signora tell you?</i>

27
00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:55.302
<i>The word is</i>

28
00:08:55.403 --> 00:08:57.204
he's going to challenge
our record.

29
00:08:57.304 --> 00:08:58.572
Is the 801 ready?

30
00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:01.175
After the Workers Mass at 9:00.
After that.

31
00:09:01.275 --> 00:09:03.310
I'll call Castellotti.

32
00:09:03.411 --> 00:09:04.345
Behra's here.

33
00:09:04.445 --> 00:09:06.013
Really?

34
00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:08.783
So many phone calls,
I thought Frank Sinatra
came to town.

35
00:09:08.883 --> 00:09:11.185
Hotel Medici, Firenze.
What do I tell them?

36
00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:13.421
"Excuse me, please,
my husband isn't here.

37
00:09:13.522 --> 00:09:16.424
He's out whoring.
<i>Grazie, buongiorno."</i>

38
00:09:16.525 --> 00:09:18.459
Signor Castellotti, please.
Enzo.

39
00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:21.962
I don't give a fuck
who you screw or how many.

40
00:09:22.997 --> 00:09:24.932
But the rule is
that you have to be here

41
00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:27.101
before the maid arrives
with the morning coffee.

42
00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:29.670
-That was the agreement,
was it not?
-Laura, please.

43
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.039
<i>Buongiorno, signora,</i>
<i>Commendatore.</i>

44
00:09:39.013 --> 00:09:39.880
<i>Pronto.</i>

45
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.615
<i>Eugenio, my boy.</i>

46
00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:42.983
<i>Commendatore.</i>

47
00:09:43.084 --> 00:09:46.187
<i>Can you be at</i>
<i>the Modena Autodrome by 11:00?</i>

48
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.988
Bring your lucky gloves.

49
00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:49.690
What gloves?

50
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.025
<i>The gloves that will beat Behra,</i>

51
00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:53.327
<i>who's come to steal</i>
<i>from you our record.</i>

52
00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:55.996
I'll be there.

53
00:09:56.097 --> 00:09:57.566
- Good.
- Will that be all, signora?

54
00:09:57.665 --> 00:09:59.366
That'll be all.

55
00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:01.368
Laura, the car broke.

56
00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:09.343
What's going on in there?

57
00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:13.914
Her gentleness, the signora,
is trying to shoot
the <i>Commendatore.</i>

58
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.019
<i>Buongiorno,</i> Peppino.
I let him live.

59
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.455
That gun was given to you
for your protection.

60
00:10:21.556 --> 00:10:23.824
And talk to Cuoghi.
You're going broke.

61
00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:27.628
I knew it would come to this.

62
00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:29.363
You gave her a gun,
she'll use it.

63
00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:32.800
She carries
the payroll for the factory
around in that handbag.

64
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.170
I'd rearm Germany
before I gave that woman a gun.

65
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.608
Peppino will take you
and Laura to the cemetery
this morning.

66
00:10:39.707 --> 00:10:41.142
And don't forget
the Workers Mass

67
00:10:41.242 --> 00:10:43.410
unless you want
to pay higher wages next year.

68
00:10:43.512 --> 00:10:44.945
Don't fight with Laura.

69
00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:46.313
Mm.

70
00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:50.317
Good morning.
No one was hurt,
so don't make a fuss.

71
00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:51.385
What?

72
00:10:51.485 --> 00:10:53.120
What have I said?

73
00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:26.987
Morning, <i>Commendatore.</i>

74
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:28.722
Good morning.

75
00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:37.398
Did you know
who was in the car?

76
00:11:37.932 --> 00:11:39.668
It was Jean Behra.

77
00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:42.403
Don't panic, Matteo.
If they take the record,
we shall take it back.

78
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:46.073
How did our football team
do yesterday?

79
00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:49.710
You know damn well.
We lost.

80
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.647
Oh, one long catalog
of disaster it's been.

81
00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:54.315
How long
since you took over?

82
00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:56.217
What about Le Mans?

83
00:11:56.317 --> 00:11:58.553
Jaguar one, two and three.
What's that?

84
00:11:58.653 --> 00:12:03.357
Well, from my mistakes I learn,
whereas the mistakes you make
you repeat, week after week.

85
00:12:03.991 --> 00:12:06.093
When you play Bologna,
I hope you win.

86
00:12:06.193 --> 00:12:08.028
Otherwise I have to
relocate the factory

87
00:12:08.128 --> 00:12:11.365
so the drivers
are not dispirited
by living in a city

88
00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:15.970
whose football team dwells
in the perpetual twilight
of failure.

89
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.439
The Modena Football Club
is the pride of Emilia.

90
00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:00.381
Cuoghi wants to meet.

91
00:13:03.652 --> 00:13:05.419
That means bad news.

92
00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:16.163
Now, your mother missed
on purpose.

93
00:13:18.566 --> 00:13:21.468
One day she won't,
and then I'll be in here
with you.

94
00:13:31.045 --> 00:13:33.380
I'm hearing voices
in my sleep again.

95
00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:36.984
My brother.

96
00:13:37.786 --> 00:13:39.253
And my father.

97
00:13:41.455 --> 00:13:43.390
No, I see their faces too.

98
00:13:45.627 --> 00:13:47.227
But also now,

99
00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:50.164
Campari and Borzacchini,

100
00:13:50.264 --> 00:13:52.534
my two good friends
who died on the same day

101
00:13:52.634 --> 00:13:55.704
24 years ago this week
at Monza

102
00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:57.572
on that evil afternoon.

103
00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:03.444
Ghosts.

104
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.018
There was a time
I loved your mother...

105
00:14:12.787 --> 00:14:14.188
beyond reason.

106
00:14:17.826 --> 00:14:20.060
Well, she was
a different creature then.

107
00:14:21.328 --> 00:14:23.063
But so was I.

108
00:14:25.667 --> 00:14:27.368
And I see you too, you know.

109
00:14:31.939 --> 00:14:34.875
Every moment I close my eyes.

110
00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:03.270
Your face I want to see.

111
00:15:11.178 --> 00:15:12.479
Okay.

112
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.982
Okay.

113
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.384
I go to deal with today.

114
00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:55.389
Did I tell you
of my son Alfredo,
Enzo's older brother?

115
00:15:56.056 --> 00:15:57.592
Many times, signora.

116
00:15:58.025 --> 00:15:58.992
A tragedy.

117
00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:01.495
I lost him in the Great War.

118
00:16:02.396 --> 00:16:03.565
Yes, signora.

119
00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:05.600
Let me tell you,

120
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.334
the wrong son died.

121
00:17:39.928 --> 00:17:42.095
If Jesus had lived today

122
00:17:42.195 --> 00:17:45.065
and not two thousand years ago,

123
00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:48.235
he would have been born
in a small town like Modena.

124
00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:52.406
He would have been
not a carpenter

125
00:17:52.507 --> 00:17:55.475
but a craftsman in metal
like yourselves.

126
00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:58.211
So a God,

127
00:17:58.312 --> 00:18:02.517
who understood,
as a carpenter,
the perfection of the adze,

128
00:18:02.617 --> 00:18:07.021
appreciates, as an engineer,
the precision of your lathe.

129
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.323
The nature of metal.

130
00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:12.560
How it can be forged,
shaped

131
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.296
and hammered by your skills
into an engine,

132
00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:20.267
holding inside a fire
to make power

133
00:18:20.367 --> 00:18:22.804
to speed us through the world.

134
00:18:24.672 --> 00:18:27.675
Which is why we give thanks
to him today.

135
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.280
Are you okay?

136
00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:39.339
May God be with you.

137
00:20:39.439 --> 00:20:41.374
Now go in peace.

138
00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:46.080
<i>In nomine Patris,</i>
<i>Filii et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

139
00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.782
- Amen.
- Amen.

140
00:20:47.882 --> 00:20:50.450
Very good. Okay. Great.

141
00:20:56.691 --> 00:20:57.759
Great.

142
00:20:59.727 --> 00:21:01.294
Great, great.

143
00:21:01.394 --> 00:21:02.697
Very, very good.

144
00:21:03.831 --> 00:21:04.999
1:32.7.

145
00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:06.868
I had 1:32.9.

146
00:21:07.502 --> 00:21:09.103
Signor Ferrari, a Maserati--

147
00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:10.303
Only for the moment.

148
00:21:10.403 --> 00:21:11.739
When do we take it back?

149
00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:13.040
Right now.

150
00:21:19.547 --> 00:21:20.581
Okay!

151
00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:33.528
Glad you could make it,
Eugenio.

152
00:21:33.628 --> 00:21:36.931
Okay, take it easy
till the tires warm up,

153
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:38.465
then put your foot down.

154
00:21:38.566 --> 00:21:41.468
She'll do 1:30
if given a chance.

155
00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:44.471
Look after Cecilia, will you?

156
00:22:13.267 --> 00:22:15.870
Two laps, and the tires
will be warm.

157
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:16.971
That's good.

158
00:22:17.071 --> 00:22:18.706
Cecilia Manzini?

159
00:22:22.475 --> 00:22:24.011
I knew your mother.

160
00:22:48.202 --> 00:22:50.137
One minute 34.

161
00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:53.507
He's slow.

162
00:23:02.049 --> 00:23:03.951
Signor Ferrari?

163
00:23:04.518 --> 00:23:06.554
Alfonso de Portago.

164
00:23:10.457 --> 00:23:12.492
We met on the Largo Garibaldi.

165
00:23:12.593 --> 00:23:14.795
Yes, sir. I was seeking
to introduce myself.

166
00:23:14.896 --> 00:23:17.098
Yeah, but the light,
it turned green.

167
00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:31.078
You bought one
of my cars last year
and won the Tour de France.

168
00:23:31.178 --> 00:23:32.313
Yes.

169
00:23:32.412 --> 00:23:33.614
Now I'm looking
for a works drive.

170
00:23:33.714 --> 00:23:36.183
I don't need another driver,
Portago.

171
00:24:33.207 --> 00:24:34.742
De Portago.

172
00:24:36.644 --> 00:24:38.713
Call my office on Monday.

173
00:24:48.889 --> 00:24:51.491
I woke you.
No, I was up.

174
00:24:52.193 --> 00:24:53.928
Did I wake the boy?

175
00:24:54.028 --> 00:24:55.062
Let me.

176
00:25:14.215 --> 00:25:15.783
You haven't said a word.

177
00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.619
What is there to say?

178
00:25:18.719 --> 00:25:21.522
The newspapers, the radio,
they have it all.

179
00:25:22.189 --> 00:25:23.224
They do?

180
00:25:25.593 --> 00:25:28.029
Was he your friend,
the young Castellotti?

181
00:25:30.097 --> 00:25:33.134
Or was it your fault?
The car's fault? His fault?

182
00:25:35.636 --> 00:25:38.272
Will you miss him?
Does that bring the boy back?

183
00:25:40.107 --> 00:25:43.010
Why do you push like that?
Why do you think?

184
00:25:44.378 --> 00:25:46.080
I know it matters to you.

185
00:25:47.381 --> 00:25:49.650
To me? Come on.

186
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.053
Twenty-four years ago
this week,

187
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.622
I lost two friends.

188
00:25:55.256 --> 00:25:56.991
Campari and Borzacchini.

189
00:25:57.825 --> 00:26:00.561
At Monza,
in the metal I made.

190
00:26:03.798 --> 00:26:06.033
So I knew then it was,

191
00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:08.235
"Enzo, build a wall."

192
00:26:11.138 --> 00:26:12.740
Or?

193
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.042
Or, "Enzo,
go do something else."

194
00:26:30.825 --> 00:26:35.229
"Ferrari
is an industrial Saturn
devouring his own children.

195
00:26:35.329 --> 00:26:38.799
First Tornaco,
now Castellotti."

196
00:26:38.899 --> 00:26:41.735
If you continue
killing the nation's heroes,

197
00:26:41.836 --> 00:26:44.872
we'll have to
go to America
and live among foreigners.

198
00:26:44.972 --> 00:26:47.942
I did not kill Castellotti.
The papers blame you.

199
00:26:48.042 --> 00:26:49.243
It wasn't me.

200
00:26:49.343 --> 00:26:51.278
If anyone,
it was his mother.

201
00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:53.380
It's true.

202
00:26:53.481 --> 00:26:56.050
He was engaged
to Cecilia Manzini.

203
00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:59.320
His mother wanted him
to marry a woman
with more class.

204
00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.623
As a result of the weight
she put on his shoulders,

205
00:27:02.723 --> 00:27:04.058
he became distracted,

206
00:27:04.158 --> 00:27:07.628
he lost his concentration,
he crashed and died.

207
00:27:07.728 --> 00:27:09.430
He blames the mother!

208
00:27:09.531 --> 00:27:12.500
What I'm saying is,
when a mother interferes
in this business,

209
00:27:12.601 --> 00:27:14.335
death usually follows.

210
00:27:20.207 --> 00:27:21.610
Call the bank.

211
00:27:21.709 --> 00:27:23.911
Cancel Castellotti's salary.

212
00:27:26.347 --> 00:27:27.848
And call Chiti.

213
00:27:27.948 --> 00:27:31.418
I need a report on the car
for the insurers.

214
00:27:35.389 --> 00:27:36.790
Yes, signora.

215
00:27:53.908 --> 00:27:55.676
There's Ferrari.

216
00:28:00.848 --> 00:28:02.349
Why is the damn top down?

217
00:28:02.449 --> 00:28:03.751
I didn't want
to get it wet.

218
00:28:03.851 --> 00:28:05.819
It belongs to King Hussein.
Get it inside.

219
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.055
And make sure the cockpit's dry
before you hand it over.

220
00:28:08.155 --> 00:28:10.157
Yes, sir, <i>Commendatore.</i>

221
00:28:18.533 --> 00:28:21.435
Stall the king and tell them
to get a move on in the shop.

222
00:28:21.536 --> 00:28:22.770
Yes, <i>Commendatore.</i>

223
00:28:25.372 --> 00:28:26.575
So?

224
00:28:26.675 --> 00:28:28.510
You're going broke.
Laura's right.

225
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.244
How?
How?

226
00:28:30.344 --> 00:28:32.547
You spend more than you make,
that's how.

227
00:28:32.647 --> 00:28:35.082
The production cars
pay for the racing.

228
00:28:35.182 --> 00:28:38.285
I could run Portugal
on what you spend on racing.

229
00:28:39.453 --> 00:28:42.189
How many production cars
did you make last year?

230
00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:45.226
Uh, 140, 150.

231
00:28:45.326 --> 00:28:47.761
Ninety-eight.
198.

232
00:28:47.861 --> 00:28:50.397
No. Ninety-eight.

233
00:28:52.199 --> 00:28:53.434
So what do I do?

234
00:28:53.535 --> 00:28:54.902
Find a partner.

235
00:28:55.002 --> 00:28:58.472
I have a partner. My wife.
She is very mean with money.

236
00:28:58.573 --> 00:28:59.840
A real partner.

237
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.443
Like Agnelli at Fiat
or Henry Ford.

238
00:29:02.544 --> 00:29:03.911
Someone who has capital
to pump in.

239
00:29:04.011 --> 00:29:06.480
No. Impossible.
With money,
they want control.

240
00:29:06.581 --> 00:29:07.982
I must have total control.

241
00:29:08.082 --> 00:29:10.719
The right partner would help
with the production cars,

242
00:29:10.818 --> 00:29:13.320
while you do what you like
with the racing.

243
00:29:15.022 --> 00:29:18.792
Increase production
to 400 customer cars a year.

244
00:29:18.892 --> 00:29:20.394
Attract finance.

245
00:29:21.762 --> 00:29:23.497
Then you can negotiate.

246
00:29:23.598 --> 00:29:27.368
How do we make--
never mind how do we sell--
400 customer cars a year?

247
00:29:27.468 --> 00:29:30.104
Jaguar took the first
three places at Le Mans.

248
00:29:30.204 --> 00:29:32.773
Now their sales books
are full.

249
00:29:32.873 --> 00:29:36.010
You win on Sunday,
you sell on Monday.

250
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.812
You already have kings
waiting in line.
Mm, Jaguar.

251
00:29:38.912 --> 00:29:41.849
Jaguar races
only to sell cars.

252
00:29:41.949 --> 00:29:43.752
I sell cars
only to be racing.

253
00:29:43.851 --> 00:29:45.720
We are completely
different organisms.

254
00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:48.389
Survive,
or you are no organism.

255
00:29:48.489 --> 00:29:50.324
Hello.

256
00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.329
I am Alfonso de Portago.

257
00:29:55.429 --> 00:29:57.998
I have an appointment
with Signor Ferrari.

258
00:30:00.735 --> 00:30:02.303
Take a seat, please.

259
00:30:10.745 --> 00:30:12.813
Win the Mille Miglia, Enzo.

260
00:30:12.913 --> 00:30:14.616
Attract outside finance.

261
00:30:14.716 --> 00:30:16.450
Or you are
out of business.

262
00:30:27.494 --> 00:30:29.597
Signor Ferrari,
this is Don Alfonso--

263
00:30:29.698 --> 00:30:31.700
Yeah, I know who it is.
Cuoghi!

264
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.434
The Marquis de Portago!

265
00:30:38.807 --> 00:30:40.074
Hey, Ferrari!

266
00:30:40.775 --> 00:30:42.009
Cuoghi!

267
00:30:47.515 --> 00:30:48.982
One more thing.

268
00:30:49.083 --> 00:30:51.619
How did Laura get her hands
on the freehold to the plant?

269
00:30:52.787 --> 00:30:54.589
The Nazis were
about to arrest me.

270
00:30:54.689 --> 00:30:57.324
I put it in her name
along with half the shares.

271
00:30:57.424 --> 00:30:59.026
We built it together.

272
00:30:59.527 --> 00:31:00.662
Get it back.

273
00:31:00.762 --> 00:31:02.530
If you face up
to Agnelli or Ford,

274
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.198
you have to hold
all the cards.

275
00:31:04.298 --> 00:31:06.233
Well, it's easier said
than done.

276
00:31:06.333 --> 00:31:07.234
Ferrari!

277
00:31:07.702 --> 00:31:08.737
Ah.

278
00:31:08.837 --> 00:31:09.903
Your Majesty!

279
00:31:10.003 --> 00:31:11.238
One more thing.

280
00:31:11.338 --> 00:31:13.508
If I'm in bad shape,
what of Maserati?

281
00:31:13.608 --> 00:31:15.844
Worse.
I give them six months.

282
00:31:15.943 --> 00:31:17.612
They've gone to the French
for finance.

283
00:31:17.712 --> 00:31:21.215
And they, too,
will try to prove themselves
at the Mille Miglia.

284
00:31:21.315 --> 00:31:25.119
Everyone's eye will be on it.
Only one team will win.

285
00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.122
Make sure it's you.

286
00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:34.395
-Your Highness!
-Which Highness?

287
00:31:35.963 --> 00:31:38.633
That Highness.
You, get out to the track.

288
00:31:38.733 --> 00:31:40.367
Your Majesty, come this way.

289
00:31:44.204 --> 00:31:46.508
I hope you got
my measurements right.

290
00:31:46.608 --> 00:31:50.512
Last time my feet could
barely touch the pedals.
Of course.

291
00:32:29.183 --> 00:32:31.218
He drives like Varzi.

292
00:33:30.578 --> 00:33:31.779
Well,

293
00:33:32.714 --> 00:33:34.014
how did I do?

294
00:33:34.816 --> 00:33:36.751
You drive like Varzi.

295
00:33:38.118 --> 00:33:40.755
Your duties will include
testing and road racing.

296
00:33:40.855 --> 00:33:43.558
The Mille Miglia?
You'll drive a works 250.

297
00:33:43.658 --> 00:33:45.259
Not the most powerful car,

298
00:33:45.359 --> 00:33:47.394
but reliable
and it goes like hell
round corners,

299
00:33:47.494 --> 00:33:49.664
so I'll expect you
to be in the points.

300
00:33:50.632 --> 00:33:52.165
Actresses.

301
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:55.503
I have admiration,
but keep them away
from the paddock.

302
00:33:55.603 --> 00:33:59.039
They distract photographers,
whose attention I want
on my cars.

303
00:33:59.139 --> 00:34:00.642
Understand?

304
00:34:00.742 --> 00:34:02.309
Okay.

305
00:34:15.757 --> 00:34:16.724
Peter.

306
00:34:18.325 --> 00:34:20.662
Look after our new driver.
He's wet and hungry.

307
00:34:20.762 --> 00:34:22.229
Hello, Fon.

308
00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:24.064
How do you do?
Pa. Papa, Papa!

309
00:34:24.164 --> 00:34:25.332
What are you doing here?

310
00:34:25.432 --> 00:34:27.735
Get the autograph.
Whose, Collins?

311
00:34:27.835 --> 00:34:29.637
No, de Portago's.

312
00:34:30.137 --> 00:34:31.639
All right.

313
00:34:37.946 --> 00:34:39.479
I could eat a horse.

314
00:34:42.951 --> 00:34:45.152
Stop pretending
you can count.

315
00:34:45.252 --> 00:34:48.488
Good to see you.
How are you?
How's your son?

316
00:34:49.057 --> 00:34:50.190
Fon.

317
00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.159
Mike Hawthorn,
future world champion.

318
00:34:52.259 --> 00:34:53.795
The famous von Trips.

319
00:34:53.895 --> 00:34:57.532
Olivier Gendebien,
the best sports car driver
in the world.

320
00:34:57.632 --> 00:35:00.735
Taruffi, the oldest.
Truly the best.

321
00:35:00.835 --> 00:35:05.105
Chiti, the best engineer,
but always, always anxious.

322
00:35:05.205 --> 00:35:06.774
And Scaglietti.

323
00:35:06.874 --> 00:35:10.778
Working on a project so secret
we are not allowed to discuss.

324
00:35:10.878 --> 00:35:13.146
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Maserati.

325
00:35:13.246 --> 00:35:15.850
So, de Portago, what brings you
to this neck of the woods

326
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:19.787
when everyone knows
the future of chassis technology
with rear engines is in England?

327
00:35:19.887 --> 00:35:21.188
- Rear engines?
- Yes.

328
00:35:21.288 --> 00:35:22.624
The ox must pull the cart.

329
00:35:22.724 --> 00:35:25.627
What we need is more power.
You hear that, Chiti?

330
00:35:26.226 --> 00:35:28.096
But they turn quick.

331
00:35:28.195 --> 00:35:29.664
And have
no straight-line speed.

332
00:35:29.764 --> 00:35:32.199
And the English,
they have a new invention
called brakes,

333
00:35:32.299 --> 00:35:34.267
unlike my 250.

334
00:35:35.235 --> 00:35:36.838
All right. To de Portago.

335
00:35:36.938 --> 00:35:38.806
Cheers.

336
00:35:40.575 --> 00:35:43.276
To de Portago's hair.

337
00:35:44.211 --> 00:35:45.713
Don't you think?

338
00:35:54.989 --> 00:35:56.557
Fon!

339
00:35:57.091 --> 00:35:59.060
Are you running around
like that?

340
00:35:59.159 --> 00:36:00.695
Oh!

341
00:36:52.747 --> 00:36:54.314
What's so funny?

342
00:36:54.916 --> 00:36:56.216
Uh...

343
00:36:57.151 --> 00:36:59.286
I wondered
when you'd be back.

344
00:36:59.386 --> 00:37:02.523
How can I stay away?
It's the plums.

345
00:37:08.029 --> 00:37:09.463
Where's Piero?

346
00:37:09.564 --> 00:37:10.998
On his way home from school.

347
00:37:12.365 --> 00:37:15.136
He asked me yesterday.
What?

348
00:37:15.235 --> 00:37:18.338
"Am I Piero Lardi
or Piero Ferrari?"

349
00:37:36.657 --> 00:37:37.859
Papa!

350
00:37:37.959 --> 00:37:39.292
Have you got it?

351
00:37:40.194 --> 00:37:42.029
The autograph. No.

352
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.165
Oh.
He hasn't, uh,

353
00:37:44.264 --> 00:37:46.601
had a proper picture
taken yet.

354
00:37:46.701 --> 00:37:47.802
What autograph?

355
00:37:47.902 --> 00:37:49.336
De Portago.
From Spain.

356
00:37:49.436 --> 00:37:51.304
He's going
to drive for me.

357
00:37:52.874 --> 00:37:54.008
Great.

358
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.782
Why do you like him so much?

359
00:38:00.882 --> 00:38:02.250
He drives like Varzi.

360
00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:04.986
I'm going
to be a driver.
Like you.

361
00:38:05.653 --> 00:38:08.488
No, not like me.
I only won a few races.

362
00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:10.290
This is much better.

363
00:38:11.225 --> 00:38:12.760
Why?

364
00:38:15.663 --> 00:38:16.931
Okay.

365
00:38:17.865 --> 00:38:19.901
Pretend you're inside
this engine.

366
00:38:21.468 --> 00:38:23.504
In the intake manifold.

367
00:38:24.505 --> 00:38:26.641
Right here. Really pretend.

368
00:38:26.741 --> 00:38:27.909
You're tiny.

369
00:38:28.609 --> 00:38:30.144
The size of a little ant.

370
00:38:30.244 --> 00:38:31.712
Now look up.

371
00:38:33.181 --> 00:38:34.447
It's silver.

372
00:38:35.448 --> 00:38:36.818
What do you see?

373
00:38:36.918 --> 00:38:38.385
A big tunnel.

374
00:38:38.485 --> 00:38:40.555
Like a pipe, yes?

375
00:38:41.122 --> 00:38:44.258
Now pretend
water races through.

376
00:38:44.357 --> 00:38:46.961
And when it hits this side,
what does it do?

377
00:38:48.062 --> 00:38:49.496
Some will splash sideways.

378
00:38:49.597 --> 00:38:54.401
But if I make the curve
more gentle,

379
00:38:55.269 --> 00:38:57.171
more slippery,

380
00:38:57.271 --> 00:38:58.706
what does it do?

381
00:38:59.507 --> 00:39:01.075
It will go faster.

382
00:39:03.845 --> 00:39:06.848
Fuel and air will move faster
just like the water.

383
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.349
And that is all an engine does.

384
00:39:09.784 --> 00:39:11.418
Moves fuel in,

385
00:39:11.519 --> 00:39:13.321
sparks them
into rapid expansion,

386
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.423
moves old gases out,
new fuel in.

387
00:39:16.524 --> 00:39:19.359
And the faster it can do that,
the more power you make.

388
00:39:25.833 --> 00:39:27.568
It looks better.

389
00:39:29.036 --> 00:39:30.370
Does it?

390
00:39:33.274 --> 00:39:34.976
I have a secret
to tell you.

391
00:39:35.977 --> 00:39:37.044
In all life,

392
00:39:37.144 --> 00:39:38.913
when a thing works better,

393
00:39:39.013 --> 00:39:41.349
usually it is more beautiful
to the eye.

394
00:39:43.551 --> 00:39:45.452
Piero, go wash up.

395
00:39:49.757 --> 00:39:50.825
Mmm.

396
00:39:53.527 --> 00:39:55.563
Are you staying to eat?

397
00:39:55.663 --> 00:39:57.331
I'll sit with you and Piero.

398
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:58.666
Will you come back after?

399
00:39:58.766 --> 00:40:01.702
It depends. I'll try.
Mm, depends on what?

400
00:40:01.802 --> 00:40:04.005
On how business with her goes.

401
00:40:08.509 --> 00:40:10.044
I'm too easy.

402
00:40:11.212 --> 00:40:12.680
What do you mean?

403
00:40:13.247 --> 00:40:14.882
Too modern.

404
00:40:15.683 --> 00:40:18.219
I should give you lots of shit
like a normal Italian woman.

405
00:40:18.319 --> 00:40:19.620
I prefer you like you are.

406
00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.421
Oh, I'm sure you do.

407
00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:25.927
What I should become
is the mistress.

408
00:40:26.027 --> 00:40:28.428
"Oh, Enzo!
I feel so sad.

409
00:40:28.529 --> 00:40:31.799
Buy me a fur coat
and a diamond necklace."

410
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.801
Piero!

411
00:40:34.467 --> 00:40:35.903
Sit down.

412
00:40:39.774 --> 00:40:43.077
Don't worry.
I do not plan
to change who I am.

413
00:40:43.177 --> 00:40:44.912
Thank you.
Thank you?

414
00:40:46.847 --> 00:40:48.049
For nothing.

415
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.185
It's not for you.

416
00:40:51.953 --> 00:40:54.855
Do you know
the hardest part
of my life with you?

417
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:57.892
There is none.
There is.

418
00:40:57.992 --> 00:40:59.593
What?
Being away.

419
00:41:00.795 --> 00:41:03.197
While with me--
what do the English say?

420
00:41:03.297 --> 00:41:04.832
A piece of pie?

421
00:41:05.399 --> 00:41:07.201
Cake, Enzo.
And you're not.

422
00:41:29.256 --> 00:41:30.758
Thank you, Alda.

423
00:41:33.493 --> 00:41:35.763
Those are from Cuoghi.

424
00:41:35.863 --> 00:41:39.300
He says our days are numbered
unless we find a new partner.

425
00:41:39.967 --> 00:41:42.336
One of the big companies.
Fiat or Ford.

426
00:41:42.436 --> 00:41:43.771
No.

427
00:41:43.871 --> 00:41:45.906
You've never had a boss.
You won't like it.

428
00:41:46.007 --> 00:41:48.943
In order
to attract this partner,
he says we have to expand.

429
00:41:49.043 --> 00:41:51.345
He's talking about
building 400 cars a year.

430
00:41:51.445 --> 00:41:53.848
How do we sell 400 cars a year?

431
00:41:53.948 --> 00:41:57.284
We have to win the Mille Miglia,
then orders for sports cars
will follow.

432
00:41:57.385 --> 00:42:01.389
This man knows contract law.
What does he know
about motor racing?

433
00:42:01.489 --> 00:42:02.957
Hmm?

434
00:42:03.057 --> 00:42:05.993
A thousand miles
across bad roads
with sheep and dogs.

435
00:42:06.093 --> 00:42:07.128
Anything can happen.

436
00:42:09.263 --> 00:42:10.598
What else?

437
00:42:11.198 --> 00:42:12.266
What else?

438
00:42:15.636 --> 00:42:19.640
You should assign me control
of your stock in the company
and the freehold,

439
00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.208
uh, so I can deal.

440
00:42:21.308 --> 00:42:22.643
Oh.

441
00:42:22.743 --> 00:42:25.179
Because Henry Ford
won't deal with a woman.

442
00:42:26.981 --> 00:42:28.282
No.

443
00:42:28.382 --> 00:42:31.619
Because if it comes to a deal,
it'll be hard and fast.

444
00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:33.754
I have to have all the cards
in my hand.

445
00:42:33.854 --> 00:42:36.290
Well, half the cards
are in my hand.
Laura.

446
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:38.359
What do you want me to say?

447
00:42:38.459 --> 00:42:42.496
"Mr. Ford, we have a deal,
but first I must wait until
I ask my wife for permission"?

448
00:42:42.596 --> 00:42:44.331
Yes, you can say that.

449
00:42:48.669 --> 00:42:50.071
You know what?

450
00:42:50.171 --> 00:42:53.340
I'm gonna give you
power of attorney over my stock,

451
00:42:53.441 --> 00:42:55.009
so you can deal.

452
00:42:57.578 --> 00:42:59.246
For half a million dollars.

453
00:42:59.346 --> 00:43:01.382
I don't have half a million!

454
00:43:01.482 --> 00:43:04.351
You will if you make a deal.

455
00:43:06.854 --> 00:43:09.290
Okay, I'll give you a check.

456
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:10.591
Post-dated.

457
00:43:12.293 --> 00:43:13.928
Not post-dated.

458
00:43:14.028 --> 00:43:16.097
I'll give you a check
on condition you promise
not to cash it

459
00:43:16.197 --> 00:43:18.332
until and unless
the deal goes through.

460
00:43:20.301 --> 00:43:21.702
Is that reasonable?

461
00:43:31.612 --> 00:43:32.880
Is that reasonable?

462
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.621
We need this.

463
00:43:41.722 --> 00:43:43.224
One condition.

464
00:43:44.058 --> 00:43:45.192
What?

465
00:43:47.495 --> 00:43:49.029
I want my gun back.

466
00:43:49.598 --> 00:43:50.898
What?

467
00:43:52.266 --> 00:43:53.801
I want my gun back.

468
00:44:47.988 --> 00:44:50.791
Did you sign de Portago?
Yes.

469
00:44:51.425 --> 00:44:53.093
I'll draw up a contract.

470
00:44:54.728 --> 00:44:57.164
And I need money
for Cecilia Manzini.

471
00:44:59.233 --> 00:45:00.535
How much money?

472
00:45:00.635 --> 00:45:02.236
25,000.

473
00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:04.104
What?

474
00:45:04.205 --> 00:45:05.439
25,000?

475
00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.840
She's broke.

476
00:45:08.242 --> 00:45:09.944
Her mother told me.

477
00:45:10.778 --> 00:45:12.079
Her mother?

478
00:45:12.179 --> 00:45:14.315
Have you been
fucking her mother?

479
00:45:14.748 --> 00:45:16.016
What?

480
00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:17.918
Are you crazy?

481
00:45:18.352 --> 00:45:20.287
I want $25,000 in cash.

482
00:45:20.387 --> 00:45:22.957
Ah, you've been fucking
the mother and the daughter.

483
00:45:23.057 --> 00:45:24.925
We have obligations
to that family.
Both.

484
00:45:25.025 --> 00:45:28.229
Oh, obligations.
So compassionate.
Sympathetic.

485
00:45:28.329 --> 00:45:29.930
Bullshit.

486
00:45:32.534 --> 00:45:33.934
Fucking bullshit.

487
00:45:34.669 --> 00:45:36.837
I am compassionate!

488
00:45:41.308 --> 00:45:42.443
Five.

489
00:45:44.044 --> 00:45:45.079
Ten.

490
00:45:45.714 --> 00:45:47.815
Fifteen million lire.

491
00:45:47.915 --> 00:45:50.518
Or 25,000 US dollars.

492
00:45:50.619 --> 00:45:51.819
Please.

493
00:45:55.923 --> 00:45:57.559
How do you want me
to enter this?

494
00:45:57.659 --> 00:46:00.327
As a bequest
to Signora Manzini.

495
00:46:00.861 --> 00:46:03.030
To buy a property.

496
00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:05.734
She'll have the use of it,
but we'll retain the freehold.

497
00:46:05.833 --> 00:46:08.769
Ah, the same arrangement
as in, uh, Castelvetro.

498
00:46:10.237 --> 00:46:12.072
Castelvetro?

499
00:46:12.674 --> 00:46:14.975
We have a property
in Castelfranco.

500
00:46:15.075 --> 00:46:16.443
Oh. Yes, yes.

501
00:46:16.544 --> 00:46:19.246
I'm sorry.
I got the towns confused.

502
00:46:27.888 --> 00:46:31.258
I also need a banker's order
for a new driver.

503
00:46:31.358 --> 00:46:32.826
His name is de Portago.

504
00:46:32.926 --> 00:46:34.495
How do you spell that?

505
00:46:34.596 --> 00:46:36.363
D-E

506
00:46:36.463 --> 00:46:41.536
P-O-R-T-A-G-O.

507
00:46:47.408 --> 00:46:48.976
Thank you.

508
00:46:49.877 --> 00:46:51.245
Thank you.

509
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.033
Castelvetro.

510
00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:19.039
As her gentleness,
the signora, commands.

511
00:47:27.915 --> 00:47:29.216
<i>Commendatore!</i>

512
00:47:29.883 --> 00:47:30.884
The press conference.

513
00:47:38.258 --> 00:47:41.462
He's dating Linda Christian,
that blonde
who follows him around.

514
00:47:41.563 --> 00:47:43.263
Who is?
De Portago.

515
00:47:43.364 --> 00:47:46.867
Tyrone Power
left Rita Hayworth
for the blonde.

516
00:47:46.967 --> 00:47:49.169
She left Tyrone Power
for de Portago.

517
00:47:49.269 --> 00:47:50.938
What are you reading,
<i>Commendatore?</i>

518
00:47:51.038 --> 00:47:52.640
"Rome Merry-Go-Round."

519
00:47:52.741 --> 00:47:55.442
Here's who will be there.

520
00:47:55.543 --> 00:47:58.713
And I will exclude
Di Massimo and Fusaro.
They are the worst.

521
00:47:58.813 --> 00:48:00.314
No, no, no.

522
00:48:00.849 --> 00:48:02.517
I want them there.

523
00:48:18.065 --> 00:48:19.801
So what do you think?

524
00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.302
Ah, there is no ashtray.

525
00:48:24.004 --> 00:48:25.707
Are you a prima donna?

526
00:48:25.807 --> 00:48:28.710
You ever tried
flicking ash out of a car
at 200 kilometers an hour?

527
00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:32.012
I'm offering you a brand-new car
which has the edge on Maserati.

528
00:48:32.112 --> 00:48:35.449
Bullshit.
The Maserati is faster
and it has an ashtray.

529
00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:39.019
If I put in an ashtray,
will you drive it
in the Mille Miglia?

530
00:48:43.725 --> 00:48:44.925
Good.

531
00:48:45.025 --> 00:48:46.360
And don't ask me
for a navigator.
Wha--

532
00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.430
You know every inch.
You've raced it 16 times.

533
00:48:50.164 --> 00:48:52.032
I can see in your eyes
you're going to ask me,

534
00:48:52.132 --> 00:48:54.134
and I'm not seduced
by you, silver fox.

535
00:48:54.234 --> 00:48:56.638
Get all these cleaned up
before the photo call.

536
00:48:57.839 --> 00:48:59.774
How'd she handle?
Good.

537
00:49:00.374 --> 00:49:02.844
This is not,
"How was lunch?" "Good."

538
00:49:02.943 --> 00:49:04.344
I want to know brake wear.

539
00:49:04.445 --> 00:49:07.281
I want steering, suspension,
gear ratios, final drive.

540
00:49:07.381 --> 00:49:10.317
If it's going to run
in the Mille Miglia,
it's got to be 100%.

541
00:49:10.417 --> 00:49:11.653
Here, talk to him.

542
00:49:11.753 --> 00:49:13.287
Go. Get inside.

543
00:49:20.929 --> 00:49:22.831
Okay, Di Massimo.

544
00:49:22.931 --> 00:49:24.331
Signor Ferrari.

545
00:49:25.533 --> 00:49:28.035
-I'm not an assassin.
-It was a figure of speech.

546
00:49:28.135 --> 00:49:29.203
Uh, <i>Commendato--</i>
Out!

547
00:49:29.303 --> 00:49:31.271
<i>Commendatore.</i>
Out.

548
00:49:32.607 --> 00:49:34.141
Fusaro.

549
00:49:34.241 --> 00:49:36.945
You said I was Saturn
devouring his young children.

550
00:49:37.044 --> 00:49:39.446
I was merely
quoting the Vatican,
<i>Commendatore.</i>

551
00:49:39.547 --> 00:49:42.483
You too. Out.

552
00:49:42.584 --> 00:49:43.618
And you, Moretti.

553
00:49:44.686 --> 00:49:46.086
A "widow-maker."

554
00:49:46.186 --> 00:49:48.857
For the record, Castellotti
was not married, okay?

555
00:49:48.957 --> 00:49:50.257
Out.

556
00:49:51.391 --> 00:49:52.660
When we win,

557
00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.864
I can't see my cars
for shots of starlets' asses.

558
00:49:55.964 --> 00:49:57.665
When we lose,
you're a lynch mob.

559
00:49:59.534 --> 00:50:01.803
It's enough
to make the pope weep.

560
00:50:01.903 --> 00:50:03.403
Next.

561
00:50:04.739 --> 00:50:07.441
Let me introduce
my spring team
for the Mille Miglia.

562
00:50:07.542 --> 00:50:10.244
Signor Ferrari! Ferrari!

563
00:50:10.344 --> 00:50:11.946
This is de Portago,

564
00:50:12.045 --> 00:50:14.181
Castellotti's
replacement.

565
00:50:14.281 --> 00:50:15.884
But he drives
like Varzi.

566
00:50:15.984 --> 00:50:18.051
Hey, Fon, is it true
about Linda Christian?

567
00:50:18.151 --> 00:50:19.253
She's your girlfriend?

568
00:50:19.353 --> 00:50:20.788
Don't answer that question.

569
00:50:20.889 --> 00:50:22.624
This is my old friend Taruffi.

570
00:50:22.724 --> 00:50:24.157
Last time he was second.

571
00:50:24.258 --> 00:50:26.761
This time
he will be first.

572
00:50:26.861 --> 00:50:30.063
Peter Collins.
Future world champion.

573
00:50:30.163 --> 00:50:32.734
Taffy von Trips. A tiger.

574
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.003
And this is
Olivier Gendebien,

575
00:50:35.102 --> 00:50:37.404
the fastest driver
of road cars in the world.

576
00:50:40.909 --> 00:50:42.442
Yes, all together.

577
00:50:42.544 --> 00:50:45.178
Smile.
A smile. Look at me, sir.

578
00:50:45.279 --> 00:50:46.881
Linda! Linda!

579
00:50:46.981 --> 00:50:48.850
Linda, look over here!

580
00:50:49.551 --> 00:50:52.185
Linda, big smile!
A shot of you by the car!

581
00:50:53.153 --> 00:50:54.856
Linda!
Linda, with the car!

582
00:51:01.763 --> 00:51:03.263
Rancati, a word after.

583
00:51:03.363 --> 00:51:05.399
- A word after.
- Smile!

584
00:51:05.499 --> 00:51:06.534
Hey, Linda!

585
00:51:26.054 --> 00:51:27.021
Stop.

586
00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.355
Stop.

587
00:51:28.455 --> 00:51:29.724
Go back.

588
00:51:30.692 --> 00:51:31.759
Go back.

589
00:51:44.171 --> 00:51:45.439
Turn right.

590
00:52:09.296 --> 00:52:10.565
Giuseppe.

591
00:52:18.305 --> 00:52:21.643
Rancati, there's something
I want you to do for me.

592
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:24.311
Write an article

593
00:52:24.411 --> 00:52:28.016
suggesting
that there are rumors

594
00:52:28.116 --> 00:52:30.952
that I'm talking
to Henry Ford II

595
00:52:31.052 --> 00:52:32.887
about the future
of the factory.

596
00:52:34.187 --> 00:52:37.825
At the end,
say you asked me, bluntly,

597
00:52:37.925 --> 00:52:40.728
and that
I categorically denied it.

598
00:52:42.329 --> 00:52:45.165
And are you?
Categorically denying it?

599
00:52:45.265 --> 00:52:47.869
Ah, yes, of course.
Categorically, I deny it.

600
00:52:50.905 --> 00:52:52.640
If I write this article,

601
00:52:53.908 --> 00:52:56.410
will you give me an exclusive
on your private life?

602
00:52:57.979 --> 00:52:59.881
Yes.

603
00:52:59.981 --> 00:53:01.649
If you promise
not to publish it.

604
00:53:04.384 --> 00:53:05.920
For the time being.

605
00:53:06.486 --> 00:53:08.388
Until I authorize it.

606
00:53:11.159 --> 00:53:13.728
Okay. It's a deal.

607
00:55:41.943 --> 00:55:43.410
You're going tonight?

608
00:55:43.511 --> 00:55:45.513
Yes. With my friends.

609
00:56:06.767 --> 00:56:07.902
He's quiet.

610
00:56:09.604 --> 00:56:11.572
I didn't get him
de Portago's autograph.

611
00:56:11.672 --> 00:56:13.841
It's not about that.

612
00:56:13.941 --> 00:56:15.442
What is it about?

613
00:56:15.543 --> 00:56:17.712
In two weeks,
he'll be confirmed.

614
00:56:18.279 --> 00:56:19.614
As whom?

615
00:56:20.181 --> 00:56:22.415
Piero Lardi
or Piero Ferrari?

616
00:56:24.585 --> 00:56:27.288
We said when he was ten,
we would sort this out.

617
00:56:27.387 --> 00:56:31.025
Then Dino's illness got worse,
and he's still Piero Lardi.

618
00:56:31.959 --> 00:56:33.393
I'm out of excuses.

619
00:56:34.394 --> 00:56:35.730
Postpone the confirmation.

620
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:38.165
His whole class
is being confirmed.

621
00:56:38.266 --> 00:56:39.967
Say he lost
his faith in God.

622
00:56:40.067 --> 00:56:41.135
Enzo.

623
00:56:42.003 --> 00:56:43.771
Who else knows about him?

624
00:56:43.871 --> 00:56:45.206
Nobody.

625
00:56:45.306 --> 00:56:47.074
Apart from
the chief of police.

626
00:56:47.808 --> 00:56:48.876
The doctor?

627
00:56:48.976 --> 00:56:50.311
Well, yes, the doctor.

628
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:51.979
And Piero's teachers.

629
00:56:52.079 --> 00:56:53.147
The teachers.

630
00:56:53.247 --> 00:56:54.916
Tavoni, Sergio.

631
00:56:55.016 --> 00:56:56.217
Of course, Tavoni.

632
00:56:56.317 --> 00:56:57.385
And the bank manager?

633
00:56:57.484 --> 00:56:58.719
The bank manager.

634
00:56:58.819 --> 00:57:00.487
Enzo.
Apart from them, no one.

635
00:57:00.588 --> 00:57:03.291
Enzo, this is Italy. Yes?

636
00:57:03.391 --> 00:57:04.759
All of Modena knows!

637
00:57:04.859 --> 00:57:06.459
Except Laura.

638
00:57:07.728 --> 00:57:09.462
And that must stay as it is.

639
00:57:09.563 --> 00:57:11.098
Especially for now.

640
00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:17.838
Oh, you're going to tell me,
"Enzo, don't be so bourgeois,
so Italian."

641
00:57:17.939 --> 00:57:20.440
Don't make me sound
like a beatnik.

642
00:57:20.541 --> 00:57:22.076
You read French books.

643
00:57:25.746 --> 00:57:27.982
What happened between us
in the war happened.

644
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:30.151
As with many.

645
00:57:30.251 --> 00:57:31.919
And sometimes
I wish it didn't.

646
00:57:35.323 --> 00:57:36.824
How can you say that?

647
00:57:37.725 --> 00:57:39.860
Because if I was a woman
like I am now,

648
00:57:39.961 --> 00:57:41.262
not 12 years ago,

649
00:57:41.362 --> 00:57:44.165
I would not have interfered
in another woman's marriage.

650
00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.669
And now she's lost a child.

651
00:57:49.804 --> 00:57:51.906
But the present is
what the present is.

652
00:57:52.006 --> 00:57:56.177
And in our world here,
between me and you and Piero,

653
00:57:57.645 --> 00:58:00.047
what is best for Piero?

654
00:58:02.116 --> 00:58:03.851
Who speaks for him?

655
00:58:08.622 --> 00:58:10.157
You're his father.

656
00:58:14.662 --> 00:58:17.131
How do we reconcile this?

657
00:58:18.099 --> 00:58:19.667
I don't know.

658
00:58:21.635 --> 00:58:23.637
But that makes it no less.

659
00:58:48.529 --> 00:58:50.264
Aren't you coming?

660
00:58:50.364 --> 00:58:52.933
No. Make an excuse for me.

661
00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:55.536
The cash for Cecilia?

662
00:58:56.237 --> 00:58:57.905
Brown envelope by the door.

663
00:59:48.322 --> 00:59:51.392
What's this I hear about you
looking for outside investors?

664
00:59:51.492 --> 00:59:53.027
Fangio eating up
all your money?

665
00:59:53.127 --> 00:59:56.497
No. With television,
it's going to become
big business.

666
00:59:56.597 --> 00:59:58.766
To do this,
one has to be capitalized.

667
00:59:59.934 --> 01:00:01.702
The game is changing, Enzo.

668
01:00:01.802 --> 01:00:05.272
And this outside capital
will magically bestow
its favors upon Maserati.

669
01:00:05.372 --> 01:00:08.375
Of course.
After we win the Mille Miglia.

670
01:03:24.639 --> 01:03:25.939
I'm pregnant.

671
01:04:08.849 --> 01:04:11.118
<i>Hawthorn is third,</i>
<i>Fangio and Collins...</i>

672
01:04:11.218 --> 01:04:12.920
Where is everybody?

673
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.455
I gave them the day off.

674
01:04:14.556 --> 01:04:16.591
No wonder
you're so late with everything.

675
01:04:16.691 --> 01:04:18.526
Enzo, it's Sunday.

676
01:04:18.626 --> 01:04:20.795
My men work weekends
all through the year for you.

677
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:24.998
Their children haven't seen them
since the day they were born.

678
01:04:25.099 --> 01:04:29.537
That's very sad.
Here's to you and that pack
of color-blind louts you employ.

679
01:04:29.637 --> 01:04:33.107
<i>De Portago is slowing down,</i>
<i>having overshot on the braking.</i>

680
01:04:33.207 --> 01:04:36.009
<i>Mrs. Vanderbilt and Cooper</i>
<i>watch excitedly</i>

681
01:04:36.110 --> 01:04:41.014
<i>as Lewis-Evans goes through</i>
<i>in the straight</i>
<i>followed by Musso's Ferrari.</i>

682
01:04:41.115 --> 01:04:45.152
<i>Vanwall leads the race,</i>
<i>averaging 120 miles per hour.</i>

683
01:04:45.252 --> 01:04:49.223
<i>Musso makes his tires smoke</i>
<i>as he strains all his nerves</i>

684
01:04:49.323 --> 01:04:51.358
<i>to try and close down the gap.</i>

685
01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:54.763
<i>We got word of a collision</i>
<i>between the BRM</i>
<i>and the Cooper-Climax.</i>

686
01:04:54.863 --> 01:04:58.533
<i>Oh! There is a lot of smoke,</i>
<i>making it very--</i>

687
01:05:18.753 --> 01:05:20.154
What is <i>problema?</i>

688
01:05:27.595 --> 01:05:29.963
Oh, no.

689
01:05:30.063 --> 01:05:31.666
Is she operable?
Ah, that's bad.

690
01:05:33.033 --> 01:05:34.501
Bad, bad. Very bad.

691
01:05:44.879 --> 01:05:50.951
<i>With three laps to go,</i>
<i>after Fangio, Musso,</i>
<i>it's Behra and de Portago.</i>

692
01:05:51.051 --> 01:05:53.353
<i>He's trying all he knows</i>
<i>to close the gap.</i>

693
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:07.234
<i>De Portago!</i>
<i>And he brakes first!</i>

694
01:06:24.284 --> 01:06:25.653
Call in de Portago.

695
01:06:28.523 --> 01:06:29.624
Hurry up. Hurry up.

696
01:06:41.903 --> 01:06:43.136
Fon. Fon.

697
01:06:43.237 --> 01:06:44.939
- What?
- Out.

698
01:06:45.038 --> 01:06:47.509
What?
Out! Peter's taking over.

699
01:06:51.078 --> 01:06:52.580
Thank you, old bean.

700
01:06:54.849 --> 01:06:57.184
Go, go, go!

701
01:07:01.088 --> 01:07:02.524
What happened?

702
01:07:11.031 --> 01:07:12.534
I could have taken him.

703
01:07:13.467 --> 01:07:15.202
<i>You lack commitment.</i>

704
01:07:19.406 --> 01:07:21.341
Look at the Maserati team.

705
01:07:22.476 --> 01:07:23.678
Fangio.

706
01:07:24.111 --> 01:07:25.379
Behra.

707
01:07:26.514 --> 01:07:28.081
Stirling Moss.

708
01:07:28.983 --> 01:07:30.652
Hard-nosed pros.

709
01:07:32.119 --> 01:07:35.690
Men with a brutal
determination to win.

710
01:07:38.358 --> 01:07:41.161
With a cruel emptiness
in their stomachs.

711
01:07:41.996 --> 01:07:43.497
Detachment.

712
01:07:44.532 --> 01:07:47.200
Loyal to one thing--
not the team.

713
01:07:47.301 --> 01:07:49.369
Loyal to their lust to win.

714
01:07:50.838 --> 01:07:52.439
It rains.

715
01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:56.076
The track is slippery with oil,
an evil-handling car.

716
01:07:56.176 --> 01:07:57.879
Will they falter? No.

717
01:07:57.979 --> 01:07:59.581
My spring team.

718
01:08:01.015 --> 01:08:03.885
Courageous? Skillful? Yes.

719
01:08:03.985 --> 01:08:05.620
Recently in school.

720
01:08:08.155 --> 01:08:11.526
Aristocrats, straight
from <i>Almanach de Gotha.</i>

721
01:08:12.827 --> 01:08:15.697
Gentlemen sportsmen.
Very nice.

722
01:08:18.398 --> 01:08:20.969
On the straight
into the tight corner
at Nouveau Monde,

723
01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:22.937
there's only one line
through it.

724
01:08:23.605 --> 01:08:26.941
Behra pulls up next to you,
challenging.

725
01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:28.977
You're even.

726
01:08:29.077 --> 01:08:33.246
But two objects cannot occupy
the same point in space
at the same moment in time.

727
01:08:33.881 --> 01:08:36.017
Behra doesn't lift.

728
01:08:36.116 --> 01:08:38.285
The corner races at you.

729
01:08:38.385 --> 01:08:40.822
You have perhaps
a crisis of identity:

730
01:08:40.922 --> 01:08:43.423
"Am I a sportsman
or a competitor?"

731
01:08:43.524 --> 01:08:46.828
"How will the French think of me
if I run Behra into a tree?"

732
01:08:46.928 --> 01:08:49.530
You lift, he passes.

733
01:08:49.631 --> 01:08:51.599
He won, you lose!

734
01:08:56.871 --> 01:09:00.708
Because at that same moment
Behra thought,
"Fuck it, we both die."

735
01:09:05.513 --> 01:09:09.117
Make no mistake,
all of us are racers--
or have been.

736
01:09:09.216 --> 01:09:12.319
We all are certain,
"It will never happen to me."

737
01:09:12.419 --> 01:09:16.456
Then my friend is killed.
I give up racing forever
on Monday.

738
01:09:16.557 --> 01:09:18.559
I'm back racing by Sunday.

739
01:09:20.128 --> 01:09:22.362
We all know
it's our deadly passion.

740
01:09:26.668 --> 01:09:28.268
Our terrible joy.

741
01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.175
But if you get
into one of my cars--

742
01:09:35.275 --> 01:09:37.979
and no one is forcing you
to take that seat--

743
01:09:38.079 --> 01:09:39.681
you get in to win.

744
01:09:42.984 --> 01:09:44.251
Brake later.

745
01:09:46.253 --> 01:09:47.889
Steal their line.

746
01:09:52.459 --> 01:09:54.595
Make them make the mistake.

747
01:10:13.181 --> 01:10:14.949
I would have taken him.

748
01:10:15.049 --> 01:10:16.483
Behra.

749
01:10:26.359 --> 01:10:28.563
I'm changing the lineup
for the Mille Miglia.

750
01:10:28.663 --> 01:10:30.865
I want you and Olivier
to swap cars.

751
01:10:30.965 --> 01:10:34.401
He'll drive the little coupe
and you'll take one
of the 335's.

752
01:10:34.501 --> 01:10:36.838
You're giving me one
of the most powerful cars
in the race.

753
01:10:36.938 --> 01:10:41.008
Well, put it another way:
I'm giving Olivier
the more agile coupe.

754
01:10:41.909 --> 01:10:43.243
Won't he mind?

755
01:10:44.011 --> 01:10:46.647
Well, of course he will,
but he'll beat you anyway.

756
01:10:54.055 --> 01:10:55.823
This is
the power of attorney

757
01:10:55.923 --> 01:10:58.826
which Signor Ferrari requested
that you put your name on.

758
01:10:59.426 --> 01:11:01.829
And the check

759
01:11:01.929 --> 01:11:04.264
for $500,000.

760
01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:08.603
It has not been signed.

761
01:11:11.271 --> 01:11:17.444
The signing of these affidavits
was conditional on the exchange
of the check.

762
01:11:17.545 --> 01:11:19.113
I'm sure
it was an oversight.

763
01:11:19.213 --> 01:11:21.015
Bullshit, Cosetti.

764
01:11:23.416 --> 01:11:24.786
Go away, please.

765
01:11:24.886 --> 01:11:25.920
Give me a pen.

766
01:12:00.154 --> 01:12:01.421
Excellent.

767
01:12:07.829 --> 01:12:12.033
I'll hold on to these
until I get my check signed.

768
01:12:16.904 --> 01:12:18.172
And...

769
01:12:19.173 --> 01:12:24.612
I want information
about special payments made
by the factory last year.

770
01:12:24.712 --> 01:12:26.113
To whom?

771
01:12:27.281 --> 01:12:29.349
Lina Lardi.

772
01:12:31.451 --> 01:12:33.120
Lina Lardi.

773
01:12:33.688 --> 01:12:35.355
I want to know
how much they are.

774
01:12:35.455 --> 01:12:38.526
I want to know for how long
they've been going on.

775
01:12:56.043 --> 01:12:56.878
Yes.

776
01:12:56.978 --> 01:12:57.979
<i>Enzo.</i>

777
01:12:58.079 --> 01:12:59.914
Lina Lardi.

778
01:13:00.648 --> 01:13:02.884
What does that name mean to you?

779
01:13:07.154 --> 01:13:09.056
<i>The boy is yours?</i>

780
01:13:09.156 --> 01:13:10.390
Yes.

781
01:13:19.533 --> 01:13:21.168
I need to think about this.

782
01:13:53.034 --> 01:13:54.902
She found out.

783
01:13:56.037 --> 01:13:58.139
The boy?
That too.

784
01:14:01.142 --> 01:14:03.177
So what do you think?

785
01:14:03.811 --> 01:14:05.546
The driver in front
will piss his pants

786
01:14:05.646 --> 01:14:07.581
when he sees it
in his mirror.

787
01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:10.818
And when it passes,

788
01:14:11.519 --> 01:14:14.121
it has an ass on it
like a Canova sculpture.

789
01:14:15.423 --> 01:14:16.924
So what do I do?

790
01:14:17.024 --> 01:14:18.759
What do you want to do?

791
01:14:18.859 --> 01:14:19.894
Leave her.

792
01:14:19.994 --> 01:14:22.063
So, do it.

793
01:14:25.333 --> 01:14:27.568
You see that pigeon
up there?

794
01:14:29.136 --> 01:14:32.807
I left its door open,
but it won't come out.

795
01:14:32.907 --> 01:14:34.842
It's forgotten
what freedom is.

796
01:14:34.942 --> 01:14:37.477
Freedom for that pigeon
is pigeon pie.

797
01:14:44.785 --> 01:14:48.122
Tell Laura that you two
should live apart,

798
01:14:48.222 --> 01:14:49.991
you are going
to live with Lina,

799
01:14:50.091 --> 01:14:51.892
and that you are going
to recognize the boy.

800
01:14:51.993 --> 01:14:54.362
Everybody thinks
that you should anyway.

801
01:14:54.462 --> 01:14:57.531
I don't give a damn
what everybody thinks.
What do you think?

802
01:15:01.168 --> 01:15:04.538
There are a lot of people
on your payroll with families.

803
01:15:05.806 --> 01:15:08.943
Ferrari needs continuity
to stay Ferrari.

804
01:15:31.265 --> 01:15:32.767
We have history.

805
01:15:43.711 --> 01:15:45.913
Stay there, pigeon,
or you're dead meat.

806
01:15:59.026 --> 01:16:01.796
The whole of Emilia knows,
but not me?

807
01:16:05.366 --> 01:16:07.768
I thought
it would break your heart.

808
01:16:07.868 --> 01:16:10.237
You broke my heart
years ago, Enzo.

809
01:16:15.276 --> 01:16:16.844
When did it start?

810
01:16:18.279 --> 01:16:19.447
The war.

811
01:16:20.047 --> 01:16:22.249
The factory had
been bombed twice.

812
01:16:23.751 --> 01:16:25.619
Uh, it began during
the worst of it.

813
01:16:25.719 --> 01:16:28.523
She worked
at Carrozzeria Orlandi.

814
01:16:28.622 --> 01:16:32.159
You and Dino were in the hills
that year, and by Christmas
she was pregnant.

815
01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.197
So I bought Castelvetro
and she went to live there.

816
01:16:37.331 --> 01:16:40.968
Is she different
from the others?

817
01:16:45.339 --> 01:16:47.041
I was in love with her.

818
01:16:49.043 --> 01:16:50.611
And I still am.

819
01:16:55.883 --> 01:16:58.919
I find myself
sharing my whole life

820
01:16:59.019 --> 01:17:01.255
with a woman
I have never met.

821
01:17:07.761 --> 01:17:10.164
It makes a mockery of you

822
01:17:10.764 --> 01:17:13.767
in the years
when our son was ill.

823
01:17:14.702 --> 01:17:15.970
When he was dying.

824
01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:18.239
How can you say that?

825
01:17:19.608 --> 01:17:20.841
That boy,

826
01:17:20.941 --> 01:17:24.078
is he going to inherit
our factory, our name?

827
01:17:24.745 --> 01:17:27.114
'Cause I don't want him to.
We have a son.

828
01:17:27.214 --> 01:17:29.016
One son, two sons.

829
01:17:29.518 --> 01:17:30.784
Five sons.

830
01:17:30.885 --> 01:17:32.853
I miss Dino any less?

831
01:17:33.555 --> 01:17:35.590
Every morning I see him
in the cemetery.

832
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:38.759
The hospital he died in
is funded in his name.

833
01:17:38.859 --> 01:17:40.694
A school was built
in his honor!

834
01:17:40.794 --> 01:17:42.631
Honor? Who gives a shit?

835
01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:44.431
You were supposed to save him!

836
01:17:45.366 --> 01:17:46.535
You blame me for his death?

837
01:17:46.635 --> 01:17:47.968
Yes!

838
01:17:48.068 --> 01:17:50.337
Yes, because you promised me
he wouldn't die!

839
01:17:51.138 --> 01:17:52.473
Everything.

840
01:17:52.574 --> 01:17:54.008
I did everything.

841
01:17:54.108 --> 01:17:56.277
Tables showing
what calories he could eat.

842
01:17:56.377 --> 01:17:58.012
What went in, what came out.

843
01:17:58.112 --> 01:18:02.216
I graphed the degrees
of albuminuria,
the degrees of azotemia!

844
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:04.118
Diuresis!

845
01:18:04.218 --> 01:18:06.887
I know more about nephritis
and dystrophy than cars!

846
01:18:06.987 --> 01:18:09.857
Yes, I blame you!
I blame you
'cause you let him die.

847
01:18:09.957 --> 01:18:12.159
The father deluded himself!

848
01:18:13.628 --> 01:18:15.763
The great engineer!

849
01:18:15.863 --> 01:18:18.132
"I will restore my son
to health."

850
01:18:18.232 --> 01:18:22.169
Swiss doctors, Italian doctors.
Bullshit. I could not.

851
01:18:22.269 --> 01:18:23.837
I did not!

852
01:18:23.938 --> 01:18:27.208
'Cause you were
so consoled at Castelvetro,
you lost your attention.

853
01:18:27.308 --> 01:18:31.111
You had another boy
growing stronger
while Dino was getting weaker!

854
01:18:31.212 --> 01:18:34.215
What goes on in your mind?
He got sick.

855
01:18:34.315 --> 01:18:36.850
Dystrophy. Kidneys!

856
01:18:36.951 --> 01:18:39.186
It destroyed him!

857
01:18:39.286 --> 01:18:40.221
It destroyed us.

858
01:18:40.321 --> 01:18:41.590
What do you care? Huh?

859
01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:43.190
You have another son!
You have another wife!

860
01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:47.161
She's not my wife.
But he is my son.

861
01:18:51.732 --> 01:18:53.000
Move out.

862
01:19:06.914 --> 01:19:12.353
These are the papers.
They give you power
to negotiate on my behalf.

863
01:19:15.055 --> 01:19:17.592
And there is a problem
with your check.

864
01:19:17.692 --> 01:19:20.160
You forgot to
put your name on it.

865
01:19:27.636 --> 01:19:29.370
We are partners.

866
01:19:30.538 --> 01:19:32.806
This is a gun
pointed at our head.

867
01:19:35.744 --> 01:19:40.281
You cash it
before I conclude the deal,
Ferrari is no more.

868
01:19:40.381 --> 01:19:41.949
That's right.

869
01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.834
It's done.

870
01:20:01.670 --> 01:20:03.003
She knows.

871
01:20:15.082 --> 01:20:16.917
You'll come to Modena.

872
01:20:17.519 --> 01:20:18.852
What?

873
01:20:19.286 --> 01:20:20.321
Why not?

874
01:20:21.088 --> 01:20:22.657
Modena is where I live.

875
01:20:22.757 --> 01:20:26.026
It's not me.
It's about Piero.

876
01:20:27.127 --> 01:20:29.063
Does he sneak around?

877
01:20:29.664 --> 01:20:31.065
As whom?

878
01:20:33.702 --> 01:20:35.570
She knows he is our boy?

879
01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:38.172
She knows he is my son.

880
01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.242
But nothing has been resolved.

881
01:20:44.813 --> 01:20:46.046
Yeah.

882
01:21:01.895 --> 01:21:03.397
Hey, Papa!

883
01:21:03.832 --> 01:21:05.499
De Portago's autograph.

884
01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.167
You go back to sleep.

885
01:21:07.267 --> 01:21:08.603
Papa!

886
01:21:10.037 --> 01:21:13.073
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!

887
01:21:13.173 --> 01:21:16.410
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!

888
01:21:16.511 --> 01:21:21.415
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!

889
01:21:21.516 --> 01:21:24.753
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!

890
01:22:03.323 --> 01:22:06.026
- Signor Ferrari.
<i>- Commendatore</i> Ferrari!

891
01:22:07.562 --> 01:22:08.897
Mr. Ferrari!

892
01:22:15.936 --> 01:22:18.506
- Ferrari!
- He's here.

893
01:22:19.306 --> 01:22:20.809
Peter.
How are you doing?

894
01:22:20.909 --> 01:22:23.076
Okay, here we go.
Come here. Come this way.

895
01:22:23.177 --> 01:22:24.646
This is Peter Collins.

896
01:22:28.348 --> 01:22:29.651
All right.

897
01:22:29.751 --> 01:22:30.984
Let's go.

898
01:22:33.454 --> 01:22:37.157
This is my new friend,
de Portago,
our newest driver.

899
01:22:37.257 --> 01:22:38.292
Okay.

900
01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:43.765
Good luck, gentlemen.

901
01:22:43.865 --> 01:22:45.633
Good afternoon,
<i>Commendatore.</i>

902
01:22:45.733 --> 01:22:48.135
Registration forms,
licenses.

903
01:22:51.739 --> 01:22:53.207
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

904
01:22:56.076 --> 01:22:58.513
Good afternoon, Orsi.

905
01:22:58.979 --> 01:23:00.615
Good afternoon, Ferrari.

906
01:23:02.851 --> 01:23:04.384
I'm entering five cars.

907
01:23:04.485 --> 01:23:09.122
Collins, Taruffi,
de Portago, von Trips,
Gendebien.

908
01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.976
Are you making them richer?

909
01:23:28.075 --> 01:23:29.744
Yes, for the humidity.

910
01:23:31.913 --> 01:23:34.348
No sleeping. Especially you.

911
01:23:44.659 --> 01:23:47.361
Good evening, <i>Commendatore.</i>
And to you, my friend.

912
01:23:47.461 --> 01:23:50.464
<i>...of the smallest</i>
<i>of the racing cars.</i>

913
01:23:50.565 --> 01:23:53.400
<i>Painted on each of the cars</i>
<i>is the time of its departure.</i>

914
01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.537
No,
judges should be at Ravenna.

915
01:23:55.637 --> 01:23:57.070
Okay.

916
01:23:59.273 --> 01:24:02.810
Make sure they show these
at every control.
Otherwise they're disqualified.

917
01:24:02.911 --> 01:24:06.614
<i>I'm honored</i>
<i>to have at my side</i>
<i>the owner of Maserati,</i>

918
01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.182
Cavaliere <i>Adolfo Orsi.</i>

919
01:24:09.283 --> 01:24:12.252
All right, I have a few
last-minute instructions.

920
01:24:13.821 --> 01:24:15.322
Refueling.

921
01:24:15.422 --> 01:24:18.826
Remind the mechanics
the gas is to go into the tanks,

922
01:24:18.927 --> 01:24:20.294
not on the drivers.

923
01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:23.463
Especially Taruffi.
I prefer he not go up in flames.

924
01:25:03.972 --> 01:25:06.741
I'm writing to Linda.
What do I say?

925
01:25:08.308 --> 01:25:10.678
I don't know. Um...

926
01:25:31.131 --> 01:25:32.634
<i>My darling Louise.</i>

927
01:25:32.734 --> 01:25:35.837
<i>The same letter</i>
<i>I write before every race.</i>

928
01:25:35.937 --> 01:25:39.439
<i>I have no worry for myself</i>
<i>in this race, as ever.</i>

929
01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:43.111
<i>My only fear</i>
<i>is that you will need me</i>
<i>and I won't be here.</i>

930
01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:48.683
<i>In that unlikely eventuality,</i>
<i>know you have</i>
<i>all my love always.</i>

931
01:26:39.934 --> 01:26:41.536
Remember what I told you.

932
01:26:41.636 --> 01:26:45.073
Get behind Taruffi and Collins.

933
01:26:45.173 --> 01:26:47.041
Okay? They know the way.

934
01:26:47.141 --> 01:26:51.244
If you can hang on to them
till you reach Bologna,
you're in with a chance.

935
01:26:51.344 --> 01:26:52.680
One last thing.

936
01:27:02.389 --> 01:27:04.291
Can you autograph this?

937
01:27:04.391 --> 01:27:07.327
It's for a very,
very special young man.

938
01:27:07.895 --> 01:27:08.963
What's his name?

939
01:27:09.664 --> 01:27:10.732
Piero.

940
01:27:11.532 --> 01:27:12.432
Piero!

941
01:27:13.266 --> 01:27:16.537
P-I-E-R-O.

942
01:27:17.437 --> 01:27:19.741
If Moss and Behra
attempt to pass,

943
01:27:19.841 --> 01:27:21.408
wave them through.

944
01:27:21.509 --> 01:27:24.277
Your job is to get round
in one piece.

945
01:27:24.946 --> 01:27:26.581
See you in Bologna!

946
01:27:26.681 --> 01:27:27.682
Good luck.

947
01:27:29.483 --> 01:27:31.619
Ready? Go.

948
01:27:36.224 --> 01:27:39.060
- Good morning, Peter.
 -And it's going to be a good one.

949
01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.895
This car can win.

950
01:27:40.995 --> 01:27:43.296
Once you're over the mountains,
you've got the legs
on the others.

951
01:27:43.396 --> 01:27:46.399
Then it's either you
or de Portago, understand?

952
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.169
Are you forgetting
about Moss and Behra?

953
01:27:48.268 --> 01:27:51.639
Watch out for stray dogs
and children.
They're the real danger.

954
01:27:53.775 --> 01:27:54.842
All right.

955
01:28:04.351 --> 01:28:06.521
Here you are.
Ah, <i>si.</i>

956
01:28:06.621 --> 01:28:10.124
You can win this one, Taruffi,
if you don't smoke yourself
to death before it's over.

957
01:28:10.224 --> 01:28:11.993
What's the weather like
on the Futa Pass?

958
01:28:12.527 --> 01:28:13.728
Good. Maybe rain.

959
01:28:13.828 --> 01:28:16.164
Listen to me.
You need this race.

960
01:28:16.264 --> 01:28:18.032
How can you tell
your grandchildren

961
01:28:18.132 --> 01:28:21.536
that you picked up
every trophy in Europe
but you've never won at Brescia?

962
01:28:21.636 --> 01:28:23.137
Make sure I get the backup.

963
01:28:23.237 --> 01:28:26.140
No foul-ups.
Especially at the fuel stops.

964
01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.909
All right, that's the spirit.

965
01:28:35.583 --> 01:28:37.685
Stirling, are we all set?
Yes.

966
01:28:37.785 --> 01:28:41.722
Take the lead right away
and stay in front.
Sure.

967
01:28:41.823 --> 01:28:43.024
Great.

968
01:28:50.832 --> 01:28:52.033
Jean,

969
01:28:52.133 --> 01:28:55.203
you stay back
behind the Ferraris.

970
01:28:55.303 --> 01:28:56.436
Wait.

971
01:28:56.537 --> 01:28:59.073
Some will break,
eliminate themselves.

972
01:28:59.173 --> 01:29:01.776
Then attack before Bologna.

973
01:29:01.876 --> 01:29:02.643
Okay?
Okay.

974
01:29:33.507 --> 01:29:34.876
Good to see you.

975
01:29:40.248 --> 01:29:42.083
For once
he did not complain.

976
01:30:26.193 --> 01:30:27.762
Do you know the way ahead?

977
01:30:27.862 --> 01:30:29.030
I'm not sure.

978
01:31:13.507 --> 01:31:15.776
Okay,
let's see what she can do.

979
01:31:31.559 --> 01:31:33.094
Let him go, Fon.

980
01:32:23.411 --> 01:32:25.913
No brakes.
Bloody pedal snapped off!

981
01:32:28.015 --> 01:32:29.884
Let's get this bugger home.

982
01:32:33.954 --> 01:32:35.923
<i>The first car into Ravenna</i>
<i>this morning</i>

983
01:32:36.023 --> 01:32:37.992
<i>was Peter Collins's Ferrari</i>

984
01:32:38.092 --> 01:32:43.431
<i>and a Fiat 500 timed</i>
<i>at 140 on the final section.</i>

985
01:32:43.532 --> 01:32:45.099
Magi, it's Ferrari.

986
01:33:08.557 --> 01:33:09.924
Moss is out.

987
01:33:46.293 --> 01:33:47.761
On this, straight.

988
01:34:24.765 --> 01:34:26.066
What's next?

989
01:34:48.389 --> 01:34:49.823
<i>Commendatore?</i>

990
01:34:49.924 --> 01:34:51.725
<i>Avvocato</i> Agnelli's
on the phone.
All right.

991
01:34:51.825 --> 01:34:54.728
Uh, sit down, gentlemen.
Excuse me for one moment.

992
01:35:05.239 --> 01:35:06.641
<i>Avvocato.</i>

993
01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:09.877
I apologize for calling
in the middle
of the race, Ferrari.

994
01:35:09.977 --> 01:35:14.649
But I have this article
by Rancati in front of me
that is, uh, so disturbing.

995
01:35:14.748 --> 01:35:16.383
<i>Avvocato,</i> it's fiction.

996
01:35:16.483 --> 01:35:19.820
I have absolutely no idea
where they get their stories.

997
01:35:23.592 --> 01:35:25.359
This is important.

998
01:35:25.459 --> 01:35:27.394
Ferrari cannot go
to foreigners.

999
01:35:27.494 --> 01:35:29.531
You are a national treasure.

1000
01:35:29.631 --> 01:35:32.299
<i>A "jewel in the crown of Italy."</i>

1001
01:35:32.399 --> 01:35:33.535
Exactly.

1002
01:35:33.635 --> 01:35:35.402
Then why does the jewel
have to scrimp

1003
01:35:35.502 --> 01:35:36.904
to put its cars
into every race?

1004
01:35:37.004 --> 01:35:39.574
If it's that bad,
why didn't you call me?

1005
01:35:39.674 --> 01:35:41.475
I did. You said no.

1006
01:35:43.043 --> 01:35:45.246
Impossible. When was this?

1007
01:35:45.346 --> 01:35:47.649
1917.
<i>Stop it.</i>

1008
01:35:47.748 --> 01:35:49.350
You were a child.

1009
01:35:49.450 --> 01:35:51.452
I was 19. I needed a job.

1010
01:35:51.553 --> 01:35:53.387
A secretary came back
with a card.

1011
01:35:53.487 --> 01:35:55.155
One word written on it:
"No."

1012
01:35:55.889 --> 01:35:57.858
That was a long time ago.

1013
01:35:57.958 --> 01:36:00.494
In business,
each day is a new day.

1014
01:36:01.195 --> 01:36:04.865
Well, the personality
of Fiat is timeless.

1015
01:36:04.965 --> 01:36:07.134
The offer you would make me
will be full of conditions.

1016
01:36:07.234 --> 01:36:10.037
<i>That is not so.</i>
My bosses will be
bookkeepers in Turin.

1017
01:36:10.137 --> 01:36:11.740
<i>We should talk this over.</i>

1018
01:36:12.439 --> 01:36:15.242
If you're looking
for financial assistance,

1019
01:36:15.342 --> 01:36:17.111
talk to me, please.

1020
01:36:17.211 --> 01:36:18.379
Not Ford.

1021
01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.181
You're busy now.

1022
01:36:21.716 --> 01:36:24.719
<i>Call me after the Mille Miglia.</i>

1023
01:36:24.818 --> 01:36:26.887
I'll call you
first thing tomorrow.

1024
01:36:34.194 --> 01:36:35.764
Okay.

1025
01:37:02.890 --> 01:37:04.358
Yup?

1026
01:37:45.065 --> 01:37:47.334
When you get to Bologna,
change the rubber.

1027
01:37:47.434 --> 01:37:49.303
I will call ahead.
Hi.

1028
01:37:49.403 --> 01:37:50.638
Hey.

1029
01:37:51.539 --> 01:37:55.275
Meet me in Brescia.
I can't.
I have a camera test.

1030
01:37:55.976 --> 01:37:57.579
I am going to win.

1031
01:37:59.614 --> 01:38:01.048
I want you to be there.

1032
01:41:04.799 --> 01:41:06.133
Took a shortcut?

1033
01:41:06.901 --> 01:41:08.435
Yeah.
Come on.

1034
01:41:26.721 --> 01:41:27.755
Hey.

1035
01:41:40.969 --> 01:41:42.502
Your keys?

1036
01:41:45.138 --> 01:41:47.341
Oh, <i>grazie. Grazie.</i>

1037
01:41:53.681 --> 01:41:55.315
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

1038
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:10.832
How much time do you have?

1039
01:42:10.932 --> 01:42:12.667
First cars arrive
in about an hour.

1040
01:42:13.768 --> 01:42:15.003
About half past 2:00.

1041
01:42:15.103 --> 01:42:16.336
Mmm.

1042
01:42:43.497 --> 01:42:46.199
Everything okay?
No, the transmission
is gone.

1043
01:42:46.299 --> 01:42:48.368
I don't know
if it's the gears
or the rear axle,

1044
01:42:48.468 --> 01:42:51.039
but the bloody thing's
buggered either way.

1045
01:42:51.139 --> 01:42:52.205
Who's behind me?

1046
01:42:52.305 --> 01:42:54.942
Everyone.
You're in the lead.

1047
01:42:55.043 --> 01:42:57.045
What about Moss?
Out.

1048
01:42:57.145 --> 01:42:58.478
When?
Before Padua.

1049
01:42:58.579 --> 01:43:00.782
Why didn't you tell me?

1050
01:43:01.616 --> 01:43:03.751
It was Moss
I was worried about.

1051
01:43:04.552 --> 01:43:05.787
Well,

1052
01:43:06.654 --> 01:43:09.456
I've fucked
the bloody transmission up
now, haven't I?

1053
01:43:12.126 --> 01:43:14.662
Kid, you want Collins's banana?

1054
01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:20.068
Peter, you can do it.
Take it easy.

1055
01:43:40.988 --> 01:43:43.223
Thank you very much.
Best of luck.

1056
01:43:43.323 --> 01:43:44.559
Thank you.

1057
01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:48.062
Taruffi, I gave you
a brand-new car.

1058
01:43:48.162 --> 01:43:49.130
Look at it!

1059
01:43:49.262 --> 01:43:50.865
The rear axle is bent.

1060
01:43:50.965 --> 01:43:54.267
I only have the first,
third and the fourth gear.

1061
01:44:03.477 --> 01:44:06.346
What happened?
I went off. Futa Pass.

1062
01:44:06.446 --> 01:44:08.248
You're a passenger
in a Ferrari.

1063
01:44:08.348 --> 01:44:09.884
You should have walked!

1064
01:44:11.786 --> 01:44:14.254
All right.
Any more damage--
I don't think it can make it.

1065
01:44:14.354 --> 01:44:16.256
Any more damage, Taruffi,
and you pay for it.

1066
01:44:16.356 --> 01:44:18.693
<i>Commendatore,</i>
now that Maserati's out,

1067
01:44:18.793 --> 01:44:21.394
we are in danger of running
the cars into the ground.

1068
01:44:21.495 --> 01:44:23.164
Order the drivers
to hold their positions.

1069
01:44:23.296 --> 01:44:25.066
Yeah, why bother? They won't.

1070
01:44:25.166 --> 01:44:27.802
Any problems, Olivier?
You're the head of your class.

1071
01:44:27.902 --> 01:44:30.037
-I'm going to win this outright.
-All right, and you can.

1072
01:44:30.138 --> 01:44:33.508
Collins's back axle is gone.
There's a problem
with Taffy's transmission.

1073
01:44:33.608 --> 01:44:35.308
That leaves Taruffi,
and he's lost a gear.

1074
01:44:35.408 --> 01:44:37.410
So it's me and de Portago.
You and de Portago.

1075
01:44:37.512 --> 01:44:39.412
Okay, let's go. Go.

1076
01:44:39.514 --> 01:44:41.249
But if we continue
at this pace--

1077
01:44:41.348 --> 01:44:44.752
For the future of the factory--
My factory is built on racing.

1078
01:44:44.852 --> 01:44:46.319
They are racers.

1079
01:44:48.122 --> 01:44:49.356
I think I can make it.

1080
01:44:49.456 --> 01:44:51.391
You better, you geriatric.

1081
01:44:51.491 --> 01:44:54.327
If you don't finish
in the first three, your wife
will never speak to you again.

1082
01:44:54.427 --> 01:44:57.064
Nor your children.
Okay, go for it!

1083
01:45:03.004 --> 01:45:04.272
How is Behra?

1084
01:45:04.371 --> 01:45:05.773
He's okay.

1085
01:45:05.873 --> 01:45:06.808
He kept coming.

1086
01:45:06.908 --> 01:45:09.811
He brakes, you pass.
You brake, he passes.

1087
01:45:09.911 --> 01:45:11.512
Or no one brakes.

1088
01:45:11.612 --> 01:45:14.115
What's going on here?
- You need new rubber.

1089
01:45:14.215 --> 01:45:15.850
I don't have time.
Check the pressures.

1090
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:18.351
Chiti, check the tires.
Nelson, did you check
the front offside?

1091
01:45:18.451 --> 01:45:19.720
Yes. It's okay.

1092
01:45:20.755 --> 01:45:22.256
We're wasting time, Ferrari.
Come on!

1093
01:45:22.355 --> 01:45:23.758
Chiti,
check the front offside.

1094
01:45:23.858 --> 01:45:25.458
- Come on, they're good.
- Chiti!

1095
01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.829
They're worn.
Will it get us to Brescia?

1096
01:45:28.696 --> 01:45:30.330
Will it get us to Brescia?

1097
01:45:34.401 --> 01:45:36.070
Go, go! Hurry up!

1098
01:45:45.813 --> 01:45:49.517
Eh, eh, Laura!
Signora! Laura, please?

1099
01:45:49.617 --> 01:45:51.686
Laura, please. Please.

1100
01:45:51.786 --> 01:45:52.854
Laura, please?

1101
01:45:52.954 --> 01:45:55.890
Please, Laura.
Another one, please.
Laura!

1102
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:57.825
<i>To bring you the latest...</i>

1103
01:45:57.925 --> 01:46:00.460
<i>...from the Mille Miglia,</i>
<i>I'm sure you are</i>
<i>as curious as I am</i>

1104
01:46:00.561 --> 01:46:02.263
<i>to see who finished</i>
<i>in glory today.</i>

1105
01:46:02.362 --> 01:46:03.998
<i>Let's hear from Signor Ferra--</i>

1106
01:46:12.405 --> 01:46:13.741
<i>Signor Ferrari,</i>
<i>who's gonna win?</i>

1107
01:46:13.841 --> 01:46:16.010
<i>It could be any</i>
<i>of the first five.</i>

1108
01:46:16.110 --> 01:46:18.411
<i>And what about</i>
<i>Gendebien's 250?</i>

1109
01:46:18.512 --> 01:46:23.383
<i>He demonstrates that even</i>
<i>the smallest Ferrari can compete</i>
<i>at the highest level.</i>

1110
01:46:23.483 --> 01:46:25.353
<i>May he win?</i>
<i>Of course he may win!</i>

1111
01:46:25.452 --> 01:46:27.788
<i>Who wants</i>
<i>to come in second?</i>

1112
01:46:29.557 --> 01:46:31.559
You knew about her
and you never told me?

1113
01:46:31.659 --> 01:46:33.728
He is entitled to an heir.

1114
01:46:35.229 --> 01:46:36.931
I gave him one.

1115
01:46:38.966 --> 01:46:42.603
As it turns out,
one was not enough.

1116
01:46:50.845 --> 01:46:53.981
I gave him one!
I gave him one!

1117
01:47:40.962 --> 01:47:42.363
Edoardo!

1118
01:47:42.462 --> 01:47:43.931
Edoardo!

1119
01:47:49.003 --> 01:47:51.605
Edoardo, go back,
wash your hands.

1120
01:48:31.645 --> 01:48:33.047
They're coming!

1121
01:48:34.181 --> 01:48:37.351
I think this guy is crazy
about these cars.

1122
01:48:37.451 --> 01:48:39.653
He's only ever thinking
about cars.

1123
01:50:39.508 --> 01:50:40.774
Peter, hi!

1124
01:50:41.242 --> 01:50:42.409
Where is Fon?

1125
01:50:42.511 --> 01:50:43.711
I don't know.

1126
01:50:43.811 --> 01:50:46.380
He was behind me
until my car broke down.

1127
01:50:47.381 --> 01:50:49.150
He'll be here somewhere.

1128
01:51:23.884 --> 01:51:25.452
<i>Commendatore?</i>

1129
01:51:27.087 --> 01:51:30.424
<i>Maresciallo,</i>
we are here to collect the car.

1130
01:51:41.101 --> 01:51:42.503
De Portago?

1131
01:51:42.604 --> 01:51:44.138
They took him away.

1132
01:52:55.677 --> 01:52:57.311
- Hello?
<i>- Piero.</i>

1133
01:52:57.878 --> 01:52:59.514
Yes.
<i>It's Enzo.</i>

1134
01:53:00.214 --> 01:53:02.584
<i>I wanted to congratulate you.</i>

1135
01:53:02.684 --> 01:53:04.184
Mmm.

1136
01:53:04.285 --> 01:53:07.187
Well, what happened is separate
from your victory today.

1137
01:53:08.389 --> 01:53:10.357
<i>It will go</i>
<i>into the history books.</i>

1138
01:53:11.392 --> 01:53:13.961
<i>-Commendatore--</i>
-Good night, Piero.

1139
01:53:14.696 --> 01:53:17.064
<i>And again, I salute you.</i>

1140
01:53:24.706 --> 01:53:27.041
The police are on their way
from Rome.

1141
01:53:27.808 --> 01:53:29.276
They want the car.

1142
01:53:38.485 --> 01:53:41.955
I don't know.
No, I don't know when.
I'm sorry.

1143
01:53:42.056 --> 01:53:44.224
I will tell him you called.

1144
01:53:47.361 --> 01:53:49.430
The <i>Commendatore</i>
is not available.

1145
01:53:51.733 --> 01:53:53.834
I'm sorry, he is really tied up.

1146
01:54:15.856 --> 01:54:19.360
Signor Ferrari is not available
to answer your questions.

1147
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:24.532
<i>Commendatore.</i>

1148
01:54:29.103 --> 01:54:31.706
This wheel hit a curb stone,
a brick.

1149
01:54:31.806 --> 01:54:33.641
Something solid to cut it.

1150
01:54:34.576 --> 01:54:35.976
It wasn't the tire.

1151
01:54:52.025 --> 01:54:53.528
Lina called me.

1152
01:54:55.896 --> 01:54:57.998
She wants me
to bring you there.

1153
01:55:03.971 --> 01:55:05.506
What happened?

1154
01:55:13.648 --> 01:55:15.650
We all know death
is nearby.

1155
01:55:17.418 --> 01:55:18.986
No, no, no, no.

1156
01:55:20.154 --> 01:55:22.289
No, children don't know.

1157
01:55:23.792 --> 01:55:24.859
Families don't know.

1158
01:55:28.663 --> 01:55:31.633
I have to talk
to those vultures.
Then drive me home?

1159
01:55:32.366 --> 01:55:34.034
Tavoni! Tommaso!

1160
01:55:37.906 --> 01:55:39.306
Enzo!

1161
01:55:43.511 --> 01:55:45.179
She cashed the check.

1162
01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:00.829
Why did you keep running drivers
on poor quality tires?

1163
01:56:00.929 --> 01:56:04.198
Did you realize
that your negligence
cost the lives

1164
01:56:04.298 --> 01:56:07.936
of nine people,
including five children?

1165
01:56:08.035 --> 01:56:10.137
How do you plan to respond
to all the accusations?

1166
01:56:10.237 --> 01:56:12.973
And how do you plan to justify
the number of casualties?

1167
01:56:14.041 --> 01:56:16.310
Castelvetro?
No.

1168
01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:18.378
Largo Garibaldi.

1169
01:56:18.479 --> 01:56:20.214
Phone Lina for me.

1170
01:56:20.314 --> 01:56:22.983
Tell her I'll call
maybe tomorrow.

1171
01:56:23.585 --> 01:56:25.052
I have business.

1172
01:56:43.571 --> 01:56:47.007
<i>Do you realize that your</i>
<i>negligence has cost the lives--</i>

1173
01:56:47.107 --> 01:56:49.878
<i>Look, if Italy</i>
<i>is looking for a scapegoat,</i>

1174
01:56:49.978 --> 01:56:51.144
<i>then here I am!</i>

1175
01:56:58.553 --> 01:56:59.587
No lights?

1176
01:56:59.687 --> 01:57:01.956
I have a headache.

1177
01:57:02.590 --> 01:57:04.792
The phone's been ringing
all night.

1178
01:57:04.893 --> 01:57:06.393
I took it off the hook.

1179
01:57:08.596 --> 01:57:10.030
You're in real trouble,
you know.

1180
01:57:10.130 --> 01:57:11.498
To do with the tires.

1181
01:57:11.599 --> 01:57:14.936
The press is competing
for who can vilify you the most.

1182
01:57:15.035 --> 01:57:16.871
Nothing wrong with the tires.

1183
01:57:16.971 --> 01:57:19.239
He hit something.
Did you take any calls?

1184
01:57:20.942 --> 01:57:22.544
Ugolini from <i>The Gazette.</i>

1185
01:57:22.644 --> 01:57:25.513
What did you tell him?
I told him to fuck himself.

1186
01:57:26.814 --> 01:57:30.317
Then that man from <i>Autosport.</i>
I told him to fuck himself.

1187
01:57:31.051 --> 01:57:32.720
Then Agnelli.

1188
01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:33.955
Agnelli?
I told him...

1189
01:57:34.054 --> 01:57:35.623
to call back.

1190
01:57:36.591 --> 01:57:38.026
Anyone else?

1191
01:57:38.125 --> 01:57:39.359
Cuoghi.

1192
01:57:39.459 --> 01:57:41.295
I told him
to fuck himself,

1193
01:57:41.395 --> 01:57:43.497
then I took the phone
off the hook.
Great.

1194
01:57:44.231 --> 01:57:45.900
Mama, what are you doing?

1195
01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.367
I'm all packed.
When do we leave?

1196
01:57:47.467 --> 01:57:50.170
We're not going anywhere.
Go back to sleep.

1197
01:58:00.347 --> 01:58:02.750
This is God's way
of punishing us.

1198
01:58:03.618 --> 01:58:05.053
Us?

1199
01:58:05.152 --> 01:58:07.989
You think
he slaughtered nine people
at Guidizzolo

1200
01:58:08.088 --> 01:58:09.824
to get even
with you and me?

1201
01:58:12.092 --> 01:58:14.094
I got a message
from the bank.

1202
01:58:14.194 --> 01:58:16.064
You cashed the check.
Mm.

1203
01:58:16.163 --> 01:58:18.465
They're calling
insolvency experts.

1204
01:58:18.566 --> 01:58:20.068
We're done.

1205
01:58:20.167 --> 01:58:22.369
The bank
is getting hysterical
over nothing.

1206
01:58:22.469 --> 01:58:24.539
Nothing?
You bankrupted us.

1207
01:58:24.639 --> 01:58:25.540
Enzo, stop it.

1208
01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:28.042
What good
are you doing yourself?

1209
01:58:28.141 --> 01:58:30.678
Mm, "I'm a scapegoat,
I'm a martyr."

1210
01:58:30.778 --> 01:58:33.681
Who are you?
Who have you become?
St. Sebastian?

1211
01:58:33.781 --> 01:58:36.584
You stand there
and let them shoot arrows
in your ass?

1212
01:58:39.921 --> 01:58:42.090
Go beat the hell
out of them.

1213
01:58:42.189 --> 01:58:45.093
The writers.
Those cheap hacks.

1214
01:58:45.192 --> 01:58:47.194
Threaten them.
Extort them.

1215
01:58:48.161 --> 01:58:50.064
And those
still on their feet,

1216
01:58:50.163 --> 01:58:53.001
the most sanctimonious
and hypocritical,

1217
01:58:53.101 --> 01:58:55.870
those, you give them
brown envelopes.

1218
01:58:58.138 --> 01:59:00.742
And then they also
will discover

1219
01:59:00.842 --> 01:59:04.679
that, "Perhaps
the Sage of Maranello
has been maligned unfairly.

1220
01:59:04.779 --> 01:59:07.882
Perhaps moderation
should reassert itself

1221
01:59:07.982 --> 01:59:10.450
in the distinguished
Italian press."

1222
01:59:12.053 --> 01:59:13.821
And for that,
you need the cash.

1223
01:59:27.602 --> 01:59:30.571
You thought I'd pack
a suitcase and go, right?

1224
01:59:30.972 --> 01:59:32.472
It crossed my mind.

1225
01:59:34.174 --> 01:59:35.910
It crossed my mind too.

1226
01:59:38.079 --> 01:59:39.212
You're financing this?

1227
01:59:39.312 --> 01:59:41.516
No, lending it.

1228
01:59:44.184 --> 01:59:45.787
And the conditions are?

1229
01:59:51.759 --> 01:59:53.561
No conditions.

1230
01:59:54.729 --> 01:59:56.296
Oh.

1231
01:59:56.931 --> 01:59:58.465
No conditions.

1232
02:00:01.969 --> 02:00:03.938
There was a part of you
in Dino.

1233
02:00:05.173 --> 02:00:08.241
Your warmth. Your wit.

1234
02:00:09.242 --> 02:00:10.712
Your joy.

1235
02:00:11.311 --> 02:00:12.814
He had that.

1236
02:00:14.649 --> 02:00:17.618
I had that from you
in our early years.

1237
02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:20.788
But after a time,

1238
02:00:21.856 --> 02:00:25.827
I only got what was left
when you came home from
the fights in the factory.

1239
02:00:27.528 --> 02:00:30.263
The ambition,
the drive, the plots.

1240
02:00:30.363 --> 02:00:31.966
The paranoia.

1241
02:00:33.735 --> 02:00:35.203
Even our fucking.

1242
02:00:35.302 --> 02:00:37.270
As if that could save Dino.

1243
02:00:41.676 --> 02:00:45.012
What I loved in you
I also found in him.

1244
02:00:51.418 --> 02:00:52.987
All that's gone.

1245
02:01:00.628 --> 02:01:02.797
There is no condition.
You have the money.

1246
02:01:07.267 --> 02:01:09.302
But it is my wish...

1247
02:01:11.304 --> 02:01:13.941
for my grief for our son,

1248
02:01:14.041 --> 02:01:16.409
for the years
building this...

1249
02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:24.886
you do not acknowledge
the boy with the name Ferrari
while I am alive.

1250
02:02:31.586 --> 02:02:33.386
How'd you get here?

1251
02:02:34.487 --> 02:02:35.923
I came with Giuseppe.

1252
02:02:36.023 --> 02:02:37.892
Giuseppe?

1253
02:02:41.128 --> 02:02:44.031
Your mother sent him
because she wants me
to come home.

1254
02:02:50.304 --> 02:02:52.439
You haven't been here
before, have you?

1255
02:02:52.907 --> 02:02:54.108
No.

1256
02:02:56.677 --> 02:02:58.079
Do you know something?

1257
02:02:58.179 --> 02:02:59.379
Hmm?

1258
02:02:59.914 --> 02:03:01.649
Your mother and you

1259
02:03:01.749 --> 02:03:03.918
are going to come
live with me in Modena.

1260
02:03:04.018 --> 02:03:05.319
Papa.

1261
02:03:05.418 --> 02:03:07.154
Is the TV reception better?

1262
02:03:09.357 --> 02:03:11.259
Much better.

1263
02:03:11.359 --> 02:03:12.894
You can see the tower
from my window.

1264
02:03:12.994 --> 02:03:15.395
Did you get
de Portago's autograph?

1265
02:03:18.099 --> 02:03:19.667
I did.

1266
02:03:22.036 --> 02:03:23.104
Come.

1267
02:03:27.875 --> 02:03:30.410
I'll introduce you
to your brother Dino.

1268
02:03:31.478 --> 02:03:33.614
I wish you could
have known him.

1269
02:03:35.650 --> 02:03:38.019
He would have taken you
with him everywhere.
