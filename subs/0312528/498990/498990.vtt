NARRATOR: There are gajillions
of stories of mischief and fun,

2
00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:23.040
but to keep things simple,
let's start with just one

3
00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:27.920
about a mom and two kids
and a house and a hat

4
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:31.883
that, oddly enough, was worn by a cat.

5
00:01:32.468 --> 00:01:36.429
But soon enough
we will get to all that.

6
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:40.433
In the valley that stretches
from this hill to that hill,

7
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.393
a city is nestled.

8
00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:45.730
That city is Anville.

9
00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:46.939

We'll miss the movie!

10
00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:48.065

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.108
I'll check.

It's a town that's not huge,
but quite big enough

13

for buyers and sellers
to sell and buy stuff,

14
00:01:57.493 --> 00:02:01.954
from shoes and shirts
and elongated ladders

15
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.751
to sailboats and gibble-grated
berry-juice bladders.

16
00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:13.090

corner of Main and Montroob

was it Sally's fault?

Why today? Why did you have to
pick today to destroy the house?

You know what's happening today.

108
00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.157
I tried to tell him, Mom.

109
00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:32.660
"Mom's throwing a very
important party," I said.

110

"All of her important
clients will be here."

111
00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.997

and wrecked the house,

I asked you to do one thing today,
Conrad, keep the house clean.

118
00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:51.929
Do you know how frustrating it is

119
00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:55.432
that you're always doing the
exact opposite of what I say?

Oh, I don't wanna be a princess.

Oh.

367
00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:12.938
Tap it.

368
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.189
Listen, kid,

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:16.775
you can tap it with a hammer,
it ain't gonna change.

and you're a rule-breaker.

So, what do we do?

376
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.706
Well, there are two
treatments I'd recommend.

377
00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:33.333
One is a series of painful shots

378
00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:35.377
injected into your
abdomen and kneecap.

379
00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:39.839
And the other
involves a musical number!

"How many shots?"
Aren't you precious?

383
00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.402
Maestro!

384
00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:05.782

good fun that is funny

Me!

Remember? The fish?

394
00:22:40.401 --> 00:22:44.195
Came home in a Baggie, loved me
for two weeks, and then nothing!

395
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.447
The fish is talking!

396
00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:48.199
Well, sure, he can talk.
But is he saying anything?

397

No, not really. No.

This cat should not be here.

399

He should not be about.
He should not be here when your mother is out.

Come on, kids.
You gonna listen to him?

401

He drinks where he pees.

There was this cat I knew
back home where I was bred

403
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:13.767
He never listened to
a single thing his mother said

404
00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:16.644
He never used the litter box
He made a mess in the hall

we could have fun!

no one will ever know.

believe what I'm seeing!

Oh, Mr. Quinn, I was just telling
Conrad to get off the couch.

541
00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:04.218
Bad, Conrad. Bad.

always land on their tushy.

landed on their feet.

So, kiddo, what do
you want to do for fun?

562
00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:27.969

know about making cupcakes,

Wait a minute.
Did you say "anything"?

586
00:32:30.365 --> 00:32:31.407
Anything.

587
00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:32.450
Anything?

588
00:32:32.534 --> 00:32:33.492
Yes, anything.

589

Anything?

590
00:32:34.828 --> 00:32:35.953
Anything.

591

Anything?

592

I'll get you, and it'll look
like a bloody accident.

593

Anything.
Now, take off the lid.

594
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:44.837
You can put in, I don't
know, a carton of eggs.

595

What?
How about a pack of hot dogs?

Why not some ketchup?

598
00:32:49.384 --> 00:32:50.468
Yeah, why not?

599
00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:51.636
How about...
I know what you're thinking.

600
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.180
Even a fire extinguisher.
There we go.

then place it in a conventional oven.

to be making that sound?

Thing Two would like to clarify that

679
00:36:55.755 --> 00:36:57.047
just because he wears the number two

680
00:36:57.132 --> 00:36:59.884
does not imply in any way that
he's inferior to Thing One.

Hey, that's my car. Joan,
we better go right away.

1068
00:58:18.579 --> 00:58:20.580
Please let me handle this.

1069
00:58:20.664 --> 00:58:22.999
Sorry, I guess I was
in a hurry to get home.

1070
00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:25.459

Not so fast, you little maggots!

1073

Oh, you are so busted.
Now get inside.

1074
00:58:51.862 --> 00:58:55.072
You don't want to go in there.
It's going to be a total...

1075
00:58:56.783 --> 00:58:58.075
What?

1076
00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.619
Sally, what happened?

1077
00:58:59.703 --> 00:59:01.078
What about the mother of all messes?

1078

Mamma mia.

1086
00:59:32.152 --> 00:59:34.403
What happened to our house?

1087
00:59:34.488 --> 00:59:36.781
It's the mother of all messes.

1088
00:59:36.865 --> 00:59:37.990
Yup!

1089

Pure, unadulterated fun without
any good sense or judgment.

1090
00:59:41.703 --> 00:59:44.038
See, Corn Dog,
this is why I warned you

1091
00:59:44.122 --> 00:59:46.040
not to open the crate.

1092
00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:48.751
Although, on the plus side,

1093
00:59:48.835 --> 00:59:50.503
I think people will be talking about

1094
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:52.713
tonight's party for
the rest of their lives.

1095
00:59:55.634 --> 00:59:57.760

Come on!

Okay.

1097
01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:03.349
Let's take the front hall carpet.

1098
01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:05.893
This can't be the front hall.

1099
01:00:05.978 --> 01:00:08.771
This is what happens when you
mix your world and my world.

1100
01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:11.190
Oh, and when you eat bad shellfish.

1101
01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:13.901
Let's go. Oh, yeah!

do we find the crate?

1103

Beats me.

1104
01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:19.824
This hat is worthless,
and it makes me look fat.

Where's Mrs. Kwan?

1106
01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:25.663
Here she comes, right on schedule.

We're going to
ride Mrs. Kwan?

1109

Sure! It's the only
way to the crate. Hop on.

1110

Something like that really burns my...

It's like a ride at an amusement park!

go back and do that again?

There's the crate!

01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:08.682
If we shut the crate, the
house will go back to normal.

1134

That's right!

1240
01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:00.868
It's getting better all the time

1241
01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:04.496
I used to get mad at my school

1242
01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:07.958
The teachers who
taught me weren't cool

1243
01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:10.002
You're holding me down

1244
01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.920
Turning me 'round

1245
01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:15.424
Filling me up with your rules

1246
01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:19.052
I've got to admit it's
getting better Better

1247
01:08:19.137 --> 01:08:21.764
A little better all the time

1248
01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.599
It can't get no worse

1249
01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:27.269
I have to admit it's
getting better Better

1250
01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:30.314
A little better since you've been mine

1251
01:08:33.902 --> 01:08:37.362
Me used to be an angry young man

1252
01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:40.115
Me hiding my head in the sand

1253
01:08:41.034 --> 01:08:44.787
You gave me the word I finally heard

1254
01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:48.332
I'm doing the best that I can, yeah

1255
01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:50.959
I've got to admit it's getting better

1256
01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:54.463
Better A little better all the time

1257
01:08:54.547 --> 01:08:55.881
Can't get no worse

1258
01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.091
I have to admit it's getting better

1259
01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:00.844
Better It's getting better

1260
01:09:00.929 --> 01:09:02.012
Since you've been mine

1261
01:09:02.096 --> 01:09:03.138
Oh, yeah!

1262
01:09:03.223 --> 01:09:04.473
Getting so much better

1263
01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.350
These drapes are so out, they're in!

1264
01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:07.851
All the time

1265
01:09:07.936 --> 01:09:09.895
It's getting better all the time

1266
01:09:10.355 --> 01:09:12.481
Better, better, better

1267
01:09:12.565 --> 01:09:13.565
Spin! Spin!

1268
01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:17.110
It's getting better all the time

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:43.178
I have to admit it's getting better

01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:46.723
A little better all the time

1272
01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:50.686
It can't get no worse Yes, I
admit it's getting better

1273
01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:51.979
It's getting better

1274
01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.063
Bye.

1275
01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:55.148
Since you've been mine

1276
01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:59.152
Getting so much better all the time

1277
01:10:02.824 --> 01:10:05.826
Okay, we had some good times.

1278
01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:07.619
We cleaned up the house.

1279
01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:10.372
We even managed to work in an
up-tempo pop tune for the soundtrack.

1280
01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:12.416
That's important.

1281
01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:16.336
I guess there's just
one last thing to check.

1282
01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:31.643
Looks like everything's in balance,

1283
01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:33.437
but you're still smoking
way too many cigars.

1284
01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:36.648
And you, lay off the sauce.

1285
01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:43.822
Cat, this day has been amazing.

1286
01:10:45.325 --> 01:10:47.284
Thank you, Cat.

1287
01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:51.997
For everything.

1288
01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:56.168
Conrad?

1289
01:10:57.712 --> 01:10:59.671
Sally?

1290
01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:03.133
Adieu.

1291
01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:08.347
SALLY: Cat!
CONRAD: Cat!

1292
01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:09.514
Wait, Cat.

1293
01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:10.641
Don't go.

1294
01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:19.191
JOAN: All right, kids.

1295
01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.275
This place better not be a mess.

1296
01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.736
I'm home.

1297
01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:24.863
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Mom.

1298
01:11:25.365 --> 01:11:27.324
Miss Walden, home so soon?

1299
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:29.409
The children were angels.

1300
01:11:29.661 --> 01:11:31.036
Thanks, Mrs. Kwan.

1301
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.120
Hello, Joan.

1302
01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:35.916
Lawrence, what happened to you?

1303
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:40.295
They happened to me.

1304
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.757
Your demonic children.

1305
01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:47.344
They destroyed your house!

1306
01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:51.682
The house was alive.

1307
01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:53.433
The wall was made of paper.

1308
01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:57.396
I fell off the cliff.
And the giant cat...

1309
01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:00.816
The giant cat!

1310
01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.568
Tell her.

1311
01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:06.113
Larry, Larry.

1312
01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:08.365
You look terrible,

1313
01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:11.034
and my mom thinks you're insane.

1314
01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:14.997
This is what we in sales
call "a win-win scenario."

1315
01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:20.293
Joan, you are passing up the
opportunity of a lifetime.

1316
01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:24.047
You know what kind of kid your boy is.

1317
01:12:24.132 --> 01:12:27.175
I mean, who are you going to believe?

1318
01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:32.055
You're right. I do know
what kind of kid Conrad is.

1319
01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:34.141
He can be irresponsible.
Yes.

1320
01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:35.225
He makes bad choices.

1321
01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:36.309
Yes.

1322
01:12:36.394 --> 01:12:37.978
Sometimes he makes me
want to tear my hair out.

1323
01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:39.604
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1324
01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:43.650
But he's a good kid,
and I believe in him.

1325
01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:45.861
Now, I'd like you to leave.

1326
01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:48.655
Wha... Joan. Joan.

01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:52.200

and the house is immaculate.

Hi, Mom.

1346
01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:50.509
Honey, your cupcakes are a huge hit.

1347
01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:51.927
What did you put in them?

1348
01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:54.721
Mom, you can make
cupcakes out of anything.

1349
01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:58.517
Are you telling me you can
make cupcakes out of anything?

1350
01:13:58.601 --> 01:13:59.810
Anything.

1351
01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.144
Anything?

1352
01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:04.648
So what did you kids do today, huh?

1353

NARRATOR: Well, what would you
do if your mother asked you?

1354
01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:11.696
The family was whole,
all thanks to the Cat,

1355
01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:14.825
who was dashing and charming,
no doubt about that.

1356
01:14:14.909 --> 01:14:16.701
He was witty and cultured

1357
01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:20.956
and, well, very endearing
and tremendously attractive,

1358
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.375
but in a sort of real way.

1359
01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.252
You know, kind of an approachable way

1360
01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:27.504
that I think
you don't see these days...

Hello! I was just...

1362
01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:32.384
I really should be going.

How about Hawaii?
I like Hawaii.

1370
01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:12.174
I should warn you,
there are certain places

1371
01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:14.259
that don't allow certain Things.

1372
01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.221
Oh, Things are complicated.

Things are getting weird
Things are getting tough

1374

Nothing's making sense
but you keep on looking up

1375
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:50.086
They tell you to be true
You're trying every day

1376
01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:53.465
To keep it on the real
Still you gotta find a way

1377
01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:57.052
To make your mama happy
To make your papa proud

1378
01:15:57.136 --> 01:16:00.513
You wanna turn it up but all
you hear is "tone it down"

Sometimes I wanna cry
or throw the towel in

They try to bring me down
but I'll take it on the chin

And everywhere I go
the people are the same

that everything will be okay

you turn it back around
