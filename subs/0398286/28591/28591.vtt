{2486}{2574}Twenty questions. Go.
{2610}{2723}You're a man. Are you in politics?
{2780}{2882}Warm beer. Tastes like piss.
{3052}{3106}It's your turn, babe.
{3107}{3160}Dead or alive?
{3161}{3293}Don't you think that's|a really stupid question these days?
{3294}{3341}You know, he's kind of an asshole,
{3342}{3387}but if you need me|to take care of him, I will.
{3388}{3413}I can hear you.
{3414}{3479}He's the one in the family|with all the brains.
{3480}{3555}Is that right?
{3700}{3753}All right, the interstate's coming up.|What do we do?
{3754}{3811}Don't get on it. Stay on this back road.
{3812}{3849}How come every time you say that,
{3850}{3921}we end up in a three-hour scenic tour|in the middle of nowhere?
{3922}{3961}Look, we agreed on the rules, didn't we?
{3962}{4013}And by taking it, we're breaking what?
{4014}{4077}The rule that says|we shouldn't take the interstate.
{4078}{4179}"I guess we wouldn't want|to break any rules," he said,
{4180}{4239}drinking his beer|as he drove the stolen Mercedes
{4240}{4330}ridiculously over the speed limit,|and, look, no hands!
{4331}{4391}-Babe, don't!|-Stop!
{4392}{4494}-Stop it, you moron!|-Don't!
{4609}{4755}-All right, smartass, I'll read the map.|-Can you? It has actual writing on it.
{4756}{4825}Very funny.
{4860}{4944}Hey, hey, hey, hey!
{5110}{5164}Hey, guys.
{5165}{5270}All right, windows, everybody.
{5296}{5379}What the hell is this guy doing?
{5380}{5489}My daughter and l, we ran out of gas.
{5490}{5562}All right, sir,|please move your car out of the road.
{5563}{5681}We left Denver yesterday morning.|Last gas we got was Colorado Springs.
{5682}{5745}I'm sorry, we can't help you.|Now move your car!
{5746}{5783}Look, all we need|is just a little bit of gas.
{5784}{5824}Yeah, I'm sure you do.|You and everybody else.
{5825}{5868}Stay where you are!
{5869}{5944}We can trade you for it.|We got food and water.
{5945}{6018}-Brian, we have more than enough.|-More than... How do you know that?
{6019}{6097}-I said do not get any closer!|-Brian, he looks clean.
{6098}{6147}Or he could be incubating.|Think about it for a second...
{6148}{6208}Guys! She's got it.
{6209}{6267}Shit!
{6270}{6372}Come on, come on, come on...
{6735}{6804}They'll die out there.
{6805}{6880}Everyone dies.
{7026}{7148}The rules are simple.|At least, that's how my brother sees it.
{7149}{7232}One, avoid the infected at all costs.
{7233}{7308}Their breath is highly contagious.
{7309}{7427}Two, disinfect anything they've touched|in the last 24 hours.
{7428}{7558}Three, the sick are already dead.|They can't be saved.
{7559}{7620}You break the rules, you die.
{7621}{7702}You follow them, you live.
{7703}{7762}Maybe.
{8243}{8335}Hey. Look what I found.
{8347}{8375}Great.
{8376}{8558}Hey, if you happen to find a brand-new|factory-issued oil pan, holler.
{8620}{8770}-Are you sure you can't fix it?|-It's blown, Ivy Boy.
{8923}{8998}-Brian.|-What?
{9045}{9116}All that car needed was gas.
{9117}{9218}Wait, what? No. No, no, no way.
{9219}{9297}-If we sit here, we're just gonna die.|-We won't if we go back?
{9298}{9411}You saw the girl.|You saw the blood, the rashes.
{9412}{9456}Bobby, come on, you saw her.
{9457}{9513}-Am I the only one here?|-Kate, we do not have a lot of options...
{9514}{9544}They're your rules!
{9545}{9598}Danny, tell your girlfriend|to get her shit together.
{9599}{9712}-I'm not his girlfriend.|-She's not my girlfriend.
{9713}{9847}All right, then tell me, tell me.|Why the hell is she here?
{9848}{9905}Why didn't we let her sit tight|in her McMansion,
{9906}{9941}-waiting for the looters?|-Okay.
{9942}{10067}Could we just calm down and try|and think this thing through? Please.
{10068}{10173}-Yeah.|-So what about the car?
{10190}{10227}I don't know, Danny. I'm trying to think.
{10228}{10353}-Well, we need that car...|-I know that!
{10387}{10445}Shit!
{10795}{10910}All right, put your masks on, guys.
{11201}{11278}Frank Holloway.
{11331}{11429}We're gonna need your car.
{11459}{11553}Yeah, I figured as much.
{11587}{11657}Do you really want to splatter|your brand-new vehicle
{11658}{11786}with the insides of someone who,|for all you know, may be infected?
{11787}{11861}We got loads of Clorox.
{11862}{11910}-Cleanup is not my chief concern.|-Brian, that's all right.
{11911}{11966}-That's close enough.|-I picked up a radio transmission
{11967}{12044}from a school outside of Farmington|last week.
{12045}{12099}People from all over the state|are travelling there.
{12100}{12139}For what?
{12140}{12206}The CDC, they set up some kind|of emergency response center.
{12207}{12258}They've got a new serum.
{12259}{12334}That's one hell of a story, man.|I don't think I've heard that one yet.
{12335}{12363}Are they getting results?
{12364}{12410}No, they're not getting any results, Kate.
{12411}{12509}They've got a new treatment, and I am|taking my daughter there in this car.
{12510}{12597}Now, if you're onboard with that, great.|If not...
{12598}{12685}This is a fairytale, and he knows it.
{12686}{12725}It's the Baltimore vaccine all over again.
{12726}{12765}It's a bunch of retrovirals|that don't work for shit.
{12766}{12809}So go ahead, Brian.|Shoot him in the head.
{12810}{12877}Wait! Hey.
{12935}{13010}I got an idea.
{13648}{13702}Hey.
{13703}{13806}Want to know a secret? About boys?
{13807}{13876}Their bark is worse than their bite.
{13877}{13926}-You know what I mean?|-No.
{13927}{13999}-It's okay.|-Don't listen to her, kiddo.
{14000}{14098}-Trust me, she loves it when I bite.|-Why don't you eat me, Brian?
{14099}{14204}-I think we can arrange that.|-Jesus, Brian! She's, like, eight.
{14205}{14312}Yeah, well, mentally, so is he.
{14974}{15106}Adi√≥s, Road Warrior.|You crap piece of shit.
{15157}{15210}But Godless governments have fallen,
{15211}{15265}and the armies of man|have perished by his hand...
{15266}{15300}Pattycake, pattycake...
{15301}{15426}...for this pandemic is the flail of God|and the world his threshing floor,
{15427}{15500}and, implacably,|he will thresh out his harvest
{15501}{15616}until the wheat is separated from|the chaff, the righteous from the sinner.
{15617}{15744}And make no mistake about it,|there shall be far more chaff than wheat.
{15745}{15770}Few chosen...
{15771}{15898}Come to think of it,|I haven't seen much weed around lately.
{15899}{15983}-Very funny.|-What?
{16031}{16078}Just show some respect.
{16079}{16165}For what?|That God's punishing my daughter?
{16166}{16240}Who's he rewarding? Who, you?
{16241}{16308}-That's not what I'm saying.|-What are you saying?
{16309}{16362}Some people locked themselves away,|piled up food,
{16363}{16442}didn't even pick up the phone.|They were dead in a week.
{16443}{16493}Me, I worked at the stadium,|digging those mass graves for 400...
{16494}{16570}-400 bucks a day!|-That's exactly right.
{16571}{16635}You can laugh all you want,|but I was up to my knees in that shit,
{16636}{16665}and here I am.
{16666}{16770}So you're immune or chosen|or something?
{16771}{16849}I'm here and they're not.
{16850}{16906}So, then, I guess you won't mind|kissing my daughter good night for me,
{16907}{16976}huh, Brian?
{16995}{17077}I didn't think so.
{17148}{17227}So much for being chosen, huh?
{17228}{17343}That's hysterical, huh, Ivy League?
{17361}{17403}Where'd you go to school, Danny?
{17404}{17472}-He got a scholarship to go to Harvard.|-Yale.
{17473}{17548}-It was Yale, actually.|-It doesn't really matter, does it?
{17549}{17666}A little something shut the place down|before freshman orientation.
{17667}{17759}-Watch it, Brian.|-How's that for a knee-slapper?
{17760}{17828}-Why do you have to be such a dick?|-Come on!
{17829}{17917}Watch out! Watch out!
{18235}{18285}You! You stay in the back, you hear me?
{18286}{18353}Hey, I will if you keep your eyes|on the goddamn road!
{18354}{18419}Hey, you can get out anytime!|You can get out right now!
{18420}{18527}-Okay. Okay. Okay.|-Kate! Kate!
{18559}{18667}The tape held.|You don't have to worry about it.
{18668}{18764}Are you okay? What is it?
{18912}{18981}Damn it.|I think she knocked a filling loose.
{18982}{19059}I weep for you.
{19140}{19211}It's locked.
{19386}{19454}Danny, be careful.
{19455}{19522}It's okay.
{19735}{19793}Shit.
{20172}{20251}Hey, are you all right? Danny!
{20252}{20327}What happened?
{20384}{20439}Jesus!
{20440}{20545}Just get the gas and let's go.
{20865}{20944}Hey, kids, we'll be back in 20.
{20945}{21040}Yeah, we'll be back in more like five.
{21041}{21088}Shit.
{21089}{21160}Bobby! Baby?
{21165}{21251}-What's that?|-That?
{21272}{21354}Well, Brian and l,
{21369}{21474}we had a dad, too.|He was just like yours.
{21475}{21576}And every summer, when we were little,|he would take us to this place.
{21577}{21624}It's Turtle Beach.
{21625}{21752}And we could swim and surf,|and we'd fish
{21777}{21952}and eat these soft-shell crab|sandwiches that were soaked in mayo.
{21965}{22015}Were there lots of turtles?
{22016}{22123}Lots? God, there were thousands|of them! They were everywhere.
{22124}{22226}I mean, you could barely put your foot|in the water without stepping on one.
{22227}{22310}Sometimes they'd be stacked up|on top of each other.
{22311}{22411}-That's impossible!|-It is possible.
{22412}{22540}-They were everywhere.|-Can we go to Turtle Beach with them?
{22541}{22616}Time to sleep.
{22621}{22730}What makes you think|you're gonna be safe there?
{22731}{22795}It's an old motel.
{22796}{22896}The place has been abandoned|for years. We'll go on scavenging trips
{22897}{22990}and quarantine ourselves|every single time we get back,
{22991}{23080}-and wait.|-Until they come for us.
{23081}{23176}Until... Until the disease dies off.
{23177}{23275}The disease or the people?
{23288}{23390}It's the same thing, really.
{23416}{23462}Bobby, I love you,
{23463}{23574}and you know|what a dipshit I can be sometimes...
{23575}{23661}What's the big deal?
{23691}{23806}I think we should see other people.
{23834}{23908}If that's the way you feel.
{23909}{23997}It is the way I feel.
{24116}{24201}-You can be such a dipshit sometimes.|-I know!
{24202}{24342}Probably the biggest in the world|at this point.
{24803}{24901}Do you ever think of Yale?
{24926}{24995}Yeah. Sure.
{25024}{25191}That, and all those things|you think you'll get to do someday.
{25287}{25336}Jesus!
{25337}{25461}-Put it out! Put the fire out!|-Go, go, go, go, go!
{25462}{25533}Where do you think you're going, boy?
{25534}{25569}-Hurry up.|-Hurry.
{25570}{25702}Just keep it down. Keep it down.|Put it out.
{28622}{28681}-Okay, I'll be right back.|-Daddy.
{28682}{28726}Honey, I'm just going in there
{28727}{28767}to make sure|there are no monsters under the bed.
{28768}{28836}If there are monsters, you shouldn't go.
{28837}{28924}Okay, now listen to me.|There's no reason to worry. All right?
{28925}{28966}I'll be back before you can say|Captain Feathersword.
{28967}{29040}Captain Feathersword.
{29041}{29093}You're too smart for me, you know that?
{29094}{29165}I'll stay with her.
{29166}{29210}Bobby.
{29211}{29258}Look, now is not the time, okay?
{29259}{29403}The girls need some alone time|to talk about boys.
{29439}{29510}I am serious.|Do not get too close to her.
{29511}{29638}I'm serious. Just go. It's gonna be fine.
{29693}{29771}You know, you are always doing|whatever the hell you want.
{29772}{29864}That's why you love me!
{30251}{30310}Hello?
{30374}{30433}Hello?
{31318}{31466}Looks like your hospital|ran out of patients, Frank.
{31485}{31592}Come on. Let's get out of here.
{31659}{31732}Where's Kate?
{31801}{31871}-What is she doing?|-Kate?
{31872}{31936}-We have to go. There's nothing here.|-You don't know that.
{31937}{31981}Kate, they failed. Let's go.
{31982}{32083}There's a whole wing|we haven't checked yet.
{32084}{32154}You see? There are people here.
{32155}{32213}Wait!
{32645}{32706}No way.
{32714}{32808}Oh, my God. They did it.
{33124}{33203}-Sir. Sir!|-Yes?
{33252}{33364}-Are you in charge here?|-No, you want Dr. Lindus.
{33365}{33445}His office is on the second floor|of the old math building.
{33446}{33553}But you won't find him there.|He died on Thursday.
{33554}{33589}Doctor, we've come all the way|from Colorado.
{33590}{33620}We heard that you had a serum here.
{33621}{33769}It's my daughter, she's...|My daughter is very sick.
{33784}{33861}-How long?|-A little over a week.
{33862}{33971}-Is she bleeding from her ears yet?|-No.
{33972}{34056}Well, bring her in.
{34081}{34192}Okay, kids, these nice people|are gonna take you to your parents,
{34193}{34244}who are all waiting outside.
{34245}{34349}So, as soon as we finish our medicine,|we'll all be right as rain.
{34350}{34499}What are you doing to these kids?|What's that? Where's the serum?
{34500}{34605}The serum? Yes, we had a serum.
{34606}{34716}For three days it stabilized the patients.|A few actually improved.
{34717}{34803}Three days.|That's the best that we could do,
{34804}{34888}or anyone else in the world|as far as I know.
{34889}{34931}Staved off the virus for three days.
{34932}{34998}Prolonged sickness and pain|for 72 hours.
{34999}{35088}Well, I'm not prolonging it anymore.
{35089}{35175}-What's in the punch?|-Potassium.
{35176}{35276}Lots and lots of potassium.
{35290}{35386}Now, if you'll excuse us.
{35449}{35512}No! No, stop! You can't do this!
{35513}{35576}Kate, they're sick. They're already dead.|Let's go.
{35577}{35630}-Brian, they are kids.|-Who's dead? My daughter's alive!
{35631}{35659}She's not dead!
{35660}{35707}-There are other places...|-Stop pulling the goddamn curtain!
{35708}{35785}Please! Please.
{35826}{35927}-Give me your gun.|-Frank, stay where you are!
{35928}{36000}-Give me your gun, Brian.|-Frank, you know I can't do that.
{36001}{36080}Give me the gun!
{36107}{36157}Danny!
{36158}{36290}Stop. Stop! Stop, goddamn you!|Stop it! Now!
{36340}{36382}Put that down.
{36383}{36456}-Put it down!|-Look around you.
{36457}{36516}We lost power two weeks ago.
{36517}{36600}We sucked the town dry of gas|just to run the generators.
{36601}{36689}There's nothing left.
{36837}{36923}Don't. Please don't.
{36982}{37164}Sometimes choosing life is just|choosing a more painful form of death.
{38287}{38369}You're telling me your favorite cartoon's|name is Mop-Face Circle-Shirt?
{38370}{38434}-No!|-Brush-Bill Soup-Jeans?
{38435}{38533}No! SpongeBob SquarePants!
{38564}{38658}Spoon-Lips Boxer-Shorts!
{38941}{39014}Frank! Frank!
{39103}{39212}Okay. You're gonna be okay, just...
{39213}{39313}Okay, listen. Breathe slow.
{39416}{39485}Okay, okay.
{40718}{40816}We're getting out of here.
{40940}{40969}What happened?
{40970}{41115}Nothing. She took it off.|She had problems breathing, I think.
{41116}{41227}-Come here.|-Daddy? I have to go.
{41303}{41422}-Number one or number two?|-Number two.
{41423}{41502}Can you hold it?
{41532}{41624}Well, how about if I get you, like, a potty|or something, can you do it here then?
{41625}{41679}No.
{41741}{41854}All right, now. I need you to be|a very big girl for me right now.
{41855}{41929}Okay? I need you to be really brave.
{41930}{42012}You see those little blue huts|over there?
{42013}{42054}I need you to go over there by yourself,
{42055}{42133}and I'll be waiting|right here for you, okay?
{42134}{42217}-Can you try that for me?|-Okay.
{42218}{42323}-Good girl. You ready?|-Ready.
{42330}{42393}Come on.
{42446}{42573}I'll be waiting right here for you, okay?
{42916}{42972}-Okay, honey. It's okay.|-Daddy.
{42973}{43065}-I'm sorry.|-No, I'm sorry.
{43066}{43244}You did great. I'm very proud of you.|Now Daddy will take you, okay?
{43290}{43407}You strike me as a good man, Daniel.
{43474}{43603}We'll be back in a minute.|Come on, honey.
{43906}{43967}Get in.
{44095}{44211}-Get... Get in the car!|-We can't leave them here. Not here.
{44212}{44254}Look, we brought them here.|That was the deal.
{44255}{44322}Now, it's time to drop the fairytales|and move on.
{44323}{44469}You heard what that doctor said.|There's nothing here. There's nothing!
{44470}{44522}You already put us in danger|once back there.
{44523}{44625}Bobby? Bobby, say something.
{45064}{45138}Hey, what was that song... What was|that song Miss Stevens taught you
{45139}{45206}-that you used to sing all the time?|-Itsy Bitsy Spider.
{45207}{45258}The Itsy Bitsy Spider, yeah.|Do you remember how to sing that?
{45259}{45384}Itsy bitsy spider went up the waterspout
{45407}{45539}Down came the rain|and washed the spider out
{45559}{45687}Out came the sun|and dried up all the rain
{45688}{45830}And the itsy bitsy spider|went up the spout again
{46530}{46637}How long till the beach, Danny?
{46663}{46755}At least two days. Why?
{46920}{47006}Anyone for 18 holes?
{47071}{47176}If we're gonna stop somewhere|for the night, might as well be high-end.
{47177}{47215}Right?
{47216}{47368}-What do you say, Bobby?|-Do whatever you want, Brian.
{48499}{48558}Hello!
{48577}{48636}Hello!
{48731}{48835}The service here is for shit.
{49055}{49111}Hey.
{49134}{49190}Hey.
{49315}{49405}-You all right?|-Yeah.
{49557}{49613}Hey.
{49746}{49857}Look, what happened back there...
{49916}{50031}I'm just trying|to get us to the beach alive.
{50032}{50151}-You know that, right?|-Yeah, I know.
{50200}{50277}We all agreed on the rules.
{50278}{50396}And the sick, they're dead.|There's nothing we can do for them.
{50397}{50456}Right.
{50464}{50600}-All right, I should go check the back.|-Okay.
{50976}{51101}Okay. Knock it off, stupid, you're fine.
{51204}{51308}Hey, Danny! I found the pool!
{51545}{51647}You want to play Marco Polo?
{51926}{51999}-Shit!|-Help!
{52005}{52063}Help!
{52081}{52175}Oh, Jesus Christ! Danny!
{52838}{52926}Let's play some golf.
{53117}{53188}Jesus! Yeah!
{53649}{53696}Hey, are you okay?
{53697}{53810}I thought golf was for old people.
{53812}{53885}-Fuck.|-Jerk!
{54054}{54125}Come on down here, baby.
{54126}{54228}-What?|-Help me out of here.
{54254}{54383}Come on, it'll be just like the time|we broke into Forest Oaks.
{54384}{54442}Remember how the groundskeeper|booted us out?
{54443}{54480}Yeah.
{54481}{54625}Well, this time we're members.|They can't touch us.
{54626}{54710}It's nice and soft.
{54729}{54838}Just come out of there. Come on.
{54877}{54963}Just give me a hand.
{55280}{55358}-Come over here! Get over here!|-Brian! Stop it!
{55359}{55436}Come on! Don't!
{55478}{55520}What?
{55521}{55602}-I'm gonna get all dirty!|-It's sand!
{55603}{55705}Yeah, sand is dirt, asshole!
{55970}{56016}Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
{56017}{56117}it's the 18th hole, and|young Brian Green steps up to the tee.
{56118}{56190}He needs a hole in one here|to get to the Masters,
{56191}{56295}but what he's really worried about|is people finding out that he's gay!
{56296}{56367}God damn it!
{56380}{56477}Dude, my advice to you|is put the club down, wait 10 minutes,
{56478}{56570}and just never pick it up again.
{56571}{56644}If it's so funny, show us what you got.
{56645}{56781}Thanks, but I think I'll use|an actual driver.
{56854}{56896}It's getting down to the wire, folks.
{56897}{57002}-Katie, Kate, whatever her last name...|-Shut up!
{57003}{57085}-All right!|-Nice.
{57179}{57242}Shit, the girl can swing!
{57243}{57323}Fairfield Country Club|Junior Champion three years in a row,
{57324}{57459}thank you very much.|Tiger Woods can kiss my ass.
{57460}{57518}Yeah!
{57665}{57730}Oh, shit.
{57942}{58000}Yeah!
{58396}{58446}Larry?
{58447}{58524}Larry, come in.
{58552}{58631}Can you hear me?
{58646}{58742}If you're there, pick up.
{58766}{58916}We're coming back. Do you hear me?|We're coming back.
{59190}{59261}What are you doing?
{59262}{59322}What the hell are you doing?
{59323}{59458}All day long, every single phone!|The phones are dead.
{59459}{59562}So, I just gotta try|and get in touch with my parents.
{59563}{59645}They're dead, too.
{59658}{59742}-You don't know that.|-I don't? Where were they?
{59743}{59813}Their cruise ship was quarantined|in Piraeus.
{59814}{59923}-Then they're dead.|-How do you know?
{59924}{60013}-You don't even know where Piraeus is!|-It doesn't matter where Piraeus is!
{60014}{60120}Everyone, everywhere, is dead,|your parents, my parents.
{60121}{60232}Soon you and I will be dead, too.
{60427}{60479}Kate, what happened?
{60480}{60541}-Leave me alone.|-Please.
{60542}{60636}What did she say to you?
{60638}{60697}Brian?
{60728}{60820}-That's not Brian.|-No.
{60938}{60967}-Shit!|-We got them!
{60968}{61033}This way!
{64411}{64543}Up on the second floor!|It's a mess up here!
{65000}{65081}Who are you,|and what the hell are you doing here?
{65082}{65134}Who are you?
{65135}{65179}Maybe we'll be able to talk|once we get rid of this.
{65180}{65302}No! Don't touch me!|Please, don't touch me!
{65303}{65390}We've been out a couple of days|scouting for supplies! We just got back!
{65391}{65460}Let him go!
{65479}{65535}Now.
{65669}{65712}We got everybody?
{65713}{65762}-I think so.|-There's nobody else.
{65763}{65810}Tom!
{65811}{65873}-My space.|-What?
{65874}{65951}They breached it. It's not safe.
{65952}{66048}I can't... It's not safe!
{66095}{66182}That's what you get|for living in a condom, man.
{66183}{66248}-You get...|-Screw you.
{66249}{66364}Hey, leave him alone!|We just wanted to spend the night here!
{66365}{66511}You sons of bitches.|What have you done with Larry?
{66633}{66696}How the hell do I know, man?
{66697}{66735}Maybe he got in a fight|with a shower curtain
{66736}{66834}like the rest of you guys.
{66878}{66989}Larry. He was guarding the place.
{67102}{67136}They killed him.
{67137}{67211}-He was like that when we got here.|-Yeah, right.
{67212}{67269}You expect us to believe that?
{67270}{67316}Why don't you go in the pool,
{67317}{67441}check out the cause of death|for yourself?
{67442}{67493}-What, no volunteers?|-Shut up.
{67494}{67609}Tom, he must have been sick|when we left and didn't say anything.
{67610}{67656}That's impossible.|You know that's impossible.
{67657}{67693}The system is perfect.
{67694}{67776}-Why? Because you thought of it?|-He didn't seal up his suit properly.
{67777}{67853}He made a mistake.|He didn't follow procedure.
{67854}{67966}Whatever gets you through the night.
{67967}{68068}You know, I just met you|and I'm already sick of you.
{68069}{68226}-I have that effect on people.|-Brian, cut it out! Jesus!
{68231}{68346}I want all of you out of here. Now.
{68512}{68540}Hey!
{68541}{68618}-Please, we need that.|-So do we.
{68619}{68670}Get in.
{68671}{68763}-Not you.|-What? Danny.
{68785}{68883}What the hell are you doing?|Let the girl go.
{68884}{68938}-The girls stay.|-No!
{68939}{68989}-Yeah, they stay.|-Get your hands off me!
{68990}{69088}-Don't you touch her, you son of a bitch!|-Don't move!
{69089}{69154}Get back!
{69172}{69217}If we keep the girls,
{69218}{69292}what are you gonna do with the guys?|Kill them?
{69293}{69352}We're not that kind of people.
{69353}{69393}Yeah?
{69394}{69556}And what kind of people are we?|The kind that just sits and waits to die?
{69557}{69615}Wait.
{69621}{69743}Screw you, Tom! This isn't the mill.|You're not in charge anymore.
{69744}{69825}Let the girls go.
{70133}{70206}We have to check them out.|Make sure they're clean.
{70207}{70266}Right.
{70392}{70438}Strip.
{70439}{70539}-Please, no.|-I said strip!
{70998}{71039}Shit, shit, shit, shit!
{71040}{71097}-What's going on?|-Oh, my God! Back off! Back off!
{71098}{71169}-Somebody tell me what's going on!|-Stay away from her!
{71170}{71244}-What the hell is going on?|-I said go!
{71245}{71303}Shit!
{71393}{71545}Get the hell out of here right now!|I said, right now!
{73827}{73869}This one's locked.
{73870}{74010}-I'm gonna look inside.|-I'll go check the back.
{74253}{74312}Danny?
{74884}{74993}Do you want to end up like them?
{75076}{75164}We will if she stays.
{75221}{75292}Talk to him.
{75389}{75486}-Brian?|-Help me out, will you?
{75487}{75526}We need to talk.
{75527}{75600}The key to the pump|has to be here somewhere.
{75601}{75764}-Brian, we need to deal with...|-Where the hell is that key?
{76120}{76197}Get in the car.
{76443}{76504}Get in.
{76738}{76803}Any luck?
{77303}{77362}Brian.
{77563}{77626}Get out.
{77718}{77795}I said get out.
{77967}{78105}-I'll get in the back.|-That's not what I said.
{78422}{78520}Brian, please let me stay.
{78542}{78628}Brian, please don't!
{78635}{78683}Brian, do not do this!
{78684}{78751}-There's a town down that road.|-These are just bruises.
{78752}{78789}I've been bouncing around|in the back of that
{78790}{78838}-stupid car for days.|-I'm sure there's plenty of water in town,
{78839}{78946}-but here's half a gallon.|-Of course I have bruises, but I am fine!
{78947}{79015}-If you ration it...|-I love you.
{79016}{79057}-...it should last a few days.|-You love me, don't you?
{79058}{79167}-The same goes for the food.|-Brian, I'll wear a mask. I didn't know.
{79168}{79239}Like hell you didn't know!
{79240}{79310}-l...|-Don't you do that!
{79311}{79362}Don't you lie to me!
{79363}{79438}I wasn't sure.
{79451}{79603}Please don't leave me here!|Please, won't you help me?
{79759}{79859}When you get to town,|you find a comfortable place,
{79860}{79958}you know, with a good bed.
{79977}{80106}And get yourself a blanket,|even if it feels hot now.
{80107}{80189}And lots of water.
{80195}{80299}Do it before you're too weak.
{80328}{80401}Brian. Brian!
{80402}{80476}I warned you about the girl.
{80477}{80519}-You...|-I told you to stay away from her.
{80520}{80645}Why the hell|couldn't you have listened to me?
{80646}{80767}She was choking. She couldn't breathe.
{81633}{81756}-Brian.|-Hey, hand me a beer, will you?
{82101}{82168}Warm beer.
{82176}{82257}Tastes like piss.
{82465}{82512}-What are we gonna do?|-I don't know.
{82513}{82622}-It's almost gone.|-I know that!
{82694}{82744}Car.
{82745}{82780}-I see it.|-We gotta make them stop.
{82781}{82838}Yeah, we'll just wave politely|and ask for help.
{82839}{82912}Brian. Brian!
{83240}{83336}Hey! I'll deal with this.
{83497}{83556}-Stay where you are!|-Don't come any closer!
{83557}{83688}I'm gonna stay right here.|We just need some gas.
{83689}{83848}-Sorry. We don't have any to spare.|-I know. I understand.
{83898}{83972}But I was just hoping|that maybe as a fellow Christian,
{83973}{84079}-you might be able to help us.|-Please don't do that.
{84080}{84176}You see, my wife in the car,|she's pregnant.
{84177}{84265}We're just looking for a cool place|to have the baby,
{84266}{84359}-see this thing through.|-Go in reverse. Let's go. Let's go.
{84360}{84407}Good luck.
{84408}{84445}-Go, go, go.|-Ma'am.
{84446}{84492}-No, I can't.|-Please.
{84493}{84572}I'm begging you!
{84601}{84668}No, Brian!
{84745}{84808}Get out!
{84826}{84889}Get out!
{85786}{85857}Get the gas.
{85869}{85932}Oh, God.
{86188}{86229}What are you doing?
{86230}{86314}They weren't gonna give it to us, Danny.
{86315}{86388}Help her out.
{86431}{86563}You don't talk to me. You hear me?|You don't tell me what to do!
{86564}{86678}Don't walk away from me,|you son of a bitch! I'm talking to you!
{86679}{86741}-What the...|-I am talking to you,
{86742}{86837}and I'm telling you what to do,|you self-righteous shit!
{86838}{86903}It must be nice sitting on the sidelines
{86904}{86952}while your dumb brother|wades in shit for you.
{86953}{87007}-No, I don't...|-Somebody had to do it.
{87008}{87049}-Was it gonna be you, Danny?|-You didn't have to...
{87050}{87123}You remember...|You remember our last day at home?
{87124}{87210}It wasn't you who went up to Mom|and Dad's room to get his gun, was it?
{87211}{87301}It wasn't you! It wasn't you|who had to go up there and lie
{87302}{87394}and tell them not to worry,|that you'd be back real soon.
{87395}{87489}-They were alive? Alive?|-You knew they were.
{87490}{87581}They were? You... You told me...
{87582}{87722}-What you wanted to hear.|-You asshole! Asshole!
{87770}{87832}Come here. Come here.|I'm an asshole for what?
{87833}{87873}Tell me, Danny, asshole for what?
{87874}{87910}For what?
{87911}{88030}For letting you walk by|with a clean conscience?
{88031}{88137}Well, that's what you like, Danny.
{88138}{88215}Remember Bobby?
{88233}{88288}You remember Bobby?
{88289}{88339}I was the one that had to drag her|out of the car
{88340}{88470}while you just sat there|watching me do it!
{88629}{88708}Bobby was right.
{88741}{88833}You got all the brains.
{91134}{91193}Danny.
{91347}{91416}Hey. Brian.
{91519}{91586}Stop here.
{91613}{91668}Brian. Brian.
{91669}{91697}We're gonna stop at this house, okay?
{91698}{91779}We're gonna find something|to dress your wound with.
{91780}{91870}Whatever you say, Doc.
{92535}{92608}Danny. There.
{92849}{92917}A little closer.
{92918}{93010}Keep going. Okay, stop.
{93826}{93885}Hello?
{94329}{94388}Hello!
{94447}{94591}If you can hear me,|we just need medical supplies.
{94615}{94692}Someone's hurt.
{94766}{94850}We're not infected,
{94865}{94947}and we don't mean you any harm.
{94948}{95001}We're...
{95002}{95150}We're just gonna take what we need,|and we'll leave.
{97108}{97231}What happened? Oh, shit!|What's on you?
{97341}{97470}It's not contagious. It's not human blood.
{97472}{97549}It's dog blood.
{97590}{97725}-You had me worried, little brother.|-I'm sorry.
{97726}{97785}Sorry.
{97892}{98065}Hey, don't take this the wrong way.|Can you pull down your pants?
{98732}{98847}Hey, so much for being chosen, huh?
{98914}{98981}I'm sorry.
{99702}{99796}He's got it, doesn't he?
{99890}{99948}Shit!
{100035}{100155}I don't know if there's anybody listening,
{100156}{100232}but my generator is dying.
{100233}{100366}So, if there is someone out there,|this is my last song.
{100367}{100478}This is Laura Merkin,|last survivor of Corpus Christi, Texas,
{100479}{100556}saying goodbye.
{100922}{101001}Can I see those?
{101559}{101657}Bobby had this crazy idea.
{101730}{101822}She wanted to be a mom.
{101879}{101967}Can you believe that?
{101974}{102037}Why not?
{102067}{102130}With me?
{102194}{102334}There are some things|I'm just not good at, man.
{102362}{102448}Where did she get...
{102458}{102519}A baby?
{102660}{102796}Who knows?|Maybe I would have been good at it.
{104309}{104391}Hey, Danny. Danny?
{104425}{104548}I gotta tell you something. It's a secret.
{104549}{104647}You want to hear a secret?
{104661}{104753}-Sure.|-At the stadium,
{104837}{104950}some of those people, they were...
{104951}{105055}They were still alive, Danny.
{105069}{105181}We were gonna dump them in the grave|and then...
{105182}{105276}Some of them would move.
{105299}{105394}I'd look at the supervisor,
{105395}{105508}and he'd pretend not to see, so...
{105510}{105619}So we'd pretend not to see them,
{105622}{105691}but we did.
{105695}{105792}We did, and we'd bury them anyway.
{105793}{105890}-There were so many bodies, Danny.|-I know.
{105891}{105973}-So many.|-I know.
{106019}{106123}How the hell did we get here?
{106158}{106267}-I don't know, Brian.|-You know.
{106306}{106379}We both know.
{106388}{106461}We both know.
{106486}{106559}We both know.
{106561}{106628}We both...
{107623}{107715}Where you going, Danny?
{107830}{107902}Where you going, man?
{107903}{107991}We're leaving, Brian.
{108233}{108369}-Come on.|-Come on, come on, come on, come on!
{108392}{108476}-Shit!|-Oh, my God.
{109344}{109416}I need those keys, Brian.
{109417}{109475}Sure.
{109497}{109579}And I need a ride.
{109602}{109717}-You know I can't.|-Come on, Danny.
{109732}{109851}The ocean, you and me, one more time.
{109874}{109954}You remember how it was.
{109955}{110077}Hitting those waves|before everything turned to shit.
{110078}{110166}Just give me the keys.
{110167}{110230}You want them?
{110231}{110335}Shoot me or take me with you.
{110412}{110563}-Brian, don't do it.|-I'm not gonna end up like them, Danny.
{110564}{110652}Rotting alive, alone.
{110668}{110736}You can't tell whether they're alive|or dead.
{110737}{110825}Please, Brian. Don't.
{110879}{111006}-It's what we decided.|-I'm dying, Danny!
{111020}{111137}I don't give a fuck about the rules.
{111171}{111246}You made them.
{111268}{111350}My little brother.
{111359}{111470}I taught him everything he knows.
{112753}{112870}I drive and wait for a storm to come
{112889}{112977}and wash us all away,
{112984}{113061}but it doesn't.
{113149}{113232}It's a beautiful day.
{113233}{113350}And it shouldn't be a beautiful day.
{113377}{113438}I wait,
{113467}{113565}but nothing happens to me.
{113602}{113765}And for the first time,|I feel like I am alone in the world.
{114090}{114236}We made it.|Two strangers with nothing left to say.
{114322}{114415}Brian and I used to love this place,
{114416}{114504}the hotel, the beach.
{114590}{114757}They still look exactly the same,|but they're just places now.
{114979}{115029}Brian! Danny! Come on!
{115030}{115113}I don't know what'll happen next.
{115114}{115223}I don't know how long I'll live.
{115401}{115501}But I know I will be alone.
