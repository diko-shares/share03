00:00:54.705 --> 00:00:58.042
<i>This is the story of how I died.</i>

2
00:00:59.585 --> 00:01:04.173
<i>But don't worry, this is a fun story,
and the truth is, it isn't even mine.</i>

3
00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:07.384
<i>This is the story of a girl
named Rapunzel.</i>

4
00:01:09.053 --> 00:01:10.763
<i>And it starts with the sun.</i>

5
00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:17.269
<i>Once upon a time, a single drop
of sunlight fell from the heavens.</i>

6
00:01:17.353 --> 00:01:23.025
<i>And from this small drop of sun
grew a magic golden flower.</i>

7
00:01:23.942 --> 00:01:27.154
<i>It had the ability to heal
the sick and injured.</i>

8
00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.201
<i>You see that old woman over there?
You might want to remember her.</i>

9
00:01:32.284 --> 00:01:33.285
<i>She's kind of important.</i>

10
00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.039
<i>Centuries passed</i>

11
00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:39.416
<i>and a hop, skip and a boat ride away
there grew a kingdom.</i>

12
00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:43.545
<i>The kingdom was ruled
by a beloved king and queen.</i>

13
00:01:44.463 --> 00:01:47.174
<i>And the queen
was about to have a baby.</i>

14
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.926
<i>But she got sick.</i>

15
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.011
<i>Really sick.</i>

16
00:01:51.762 --> 00:01:53.055
<i>She was running out of time,</i>

17
00:01:53.138 --> 00:01:56.225
<i>and that's when people
start to look for a miracle.</i>

18
00:01:56.308 --> 00:01:59.103
<i>Or in this case, a magic golden flower.</i>

19
00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:02.898
<i>I told you she'd be important.</i>

20
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:05.234
<i>Instead of sharing the sun's gift,</i>

21
00:02:05.317 --> 00:02:08.028
<i>this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded its healing power</i>

22
00:02:08.112 --> 00:02:11.407
<i>and used it to keep herself young
for hundreds of years.</i>

23
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.993
<i>And all she had to do
was sing a special song.</i>

24
00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:19.373
<i>♪ Flower, gleam and glow ♪</i>

25
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.836
<i>♪ Let your power shine ♪</i>

<i>♪ Bring back what once was mine ♪</i>

28
00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:34.763
<i>♪ What once was mine ♪</i>

29
00:02:34.847 --> 00:02:38.976
<i>You get the gist. She sings to it,
she turns young. Creepy, right?</i>

30
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.863
We found it!

31
00:02:57.035 --> 00:03:01.707
<i>The magic of the golden flower
healed the queen.</i>

32
00:03:02.541 --> 00:03:07.546
<i>A healthy baby girl, a princess
was born, with beautiful golden hair.</i>

33
00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:19.224
<i>I'll give you a hint, that's Rapunzel.</i>

34
00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:22.478
<i>To celebrate her birth,</i>

35
00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:25.898
<i>the king and queen
launched a flying lantern into the sky.</i>

36
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.531
<i>And for that one moment,
everything was perfect.</i>

37
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:38.994
<i>And then that moment ended.</i>

38
00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:44.833

<i>♪ Make the clock... ♪</i>

41
00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:01.975
<i>Gothel broke into the castle,
stole the child,</i>

42
00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:04.102
<i>and just like that, gone!</i>

43
00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:09.733
<i>The kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the princess.</i>

44
00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:13.111
<i>For deep within the forest,
in a hidden tower,</i>

45
00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:14.696
<i>Gothel raised the child as her own.</i>

46

49
00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:27.042
<i>Gothel had found
her new magic flower,</i>

50
00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:29.836
<i>but this time,
she was determined to keep it hidden.</i>

51
00:04:30.462 --> 00:04:33.048
Why can't I go outside?

52
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:35.759
The outside world is a dangerous place,

53
00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:38.387
filled with horrible, selfish people.

54
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.557
You must stay here, where you're safe.

55
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.225
Do you understand, flower?

56
00:04:43.308 --> 00:04:44.685
Yes, Mommy.

57
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.526
<i>But the walls of that tower
could not hide everything.</i>

58
00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:57.281
<i>Each year, on her birthday,</i>

59
00:04:57.364 --> 00:05:00.909
<i>the king and queen released
thousands of lanterns into the sky</i>

60
00:05:00.993 --> 00:05:06.081
<i>in hope that one day
their lost princess would return.</i>

61
00:05:28.604 --> 00:05:32.107
Well, I guess
Pascal's not hiding out here.

62
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.320
Gotcha!

63
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.576
That's 22 for me.
How about 23 out of 45?

64
00:05:43.994 --> 00:05:46.121
Okay. Well, what do you want to do?

65
00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:53.712
Yeah. I don't think so.
I like it in here, and so do you.

66
00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:59.217

Rider, come on!

95
00:08:47.052 --> 00:08:52.307
Hold on. Yep. I'm used to it.
Guys, I want a castle.

96
00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:55.602
We do this job,
you can buy your own castle.

97
00:09:07.989 --> 00:09:09.991
- Hay fever?
- Yeah.

98
00:09:13.662 --> 00:09:16.581
Wait! Hey, wait!

99
00:09:17.415 --> 00:09:20.168
Can't you picture me in a castle
of my own? Because I certainly can.

100
00:09:20.252 --> 00:09:23.129
All the things we've seen,
and it's only 8:00 in the morning!

101
00:09:23.213 --> 00:09:26.299
Gentlemen, this is a very big day!

102
00:09:27.425 --> 00:09:30.929
This is it! This is a very big day, Pascal.

103
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.933
I'm finally going to do it.
I'm going to ask her.

104
00:09:35.016 --> 00:09:37.102
Rapunzel!

105
00:09:37.602 --> 00:09:39.271
Let down your hair!

106
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.273
It's time!

107
00:09:42.566 --> 00:09:45.861
I know, I know.
Come on. Don't let her see you.

108
00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:52.158
Rapunzel!
I'm not getting any younger down here!

109
00:09:53.034 --> 00:09:54.578
Coming, Mother!

110
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.396
Hi. Welcome home, Mother.

111
00:10:21.479 --> 00:10:24.733
Rapunzel, how you manage to do that

112
00:10:24.816 --> 00:10:27.986
every single day without fail.

113
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:30.488
It looks absolutely exhausting, darling.

114
00:10:30.572 --> 00:10:32.949
Oh, it's nothing.

115
00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.327
Then I don't know why it takes so long.

116
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.829
Oh, darling, I'm just teasing.

117
00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:41.333
All right.

118
00:10:41.416 --> 00:10:44.753
So, Mother, as you know
tomorrow is a very big day...

119
00:10:44.836 --> 00:10:46.421
Rapunzel, look in that mirror.

120
00:10:46.504 --> 00:10:47.964
You know what I see?

121
00:10:48.048 --> 00:10:52.135
I see a strong, confident,
beautiful young lady.

122
00:10:53.261 --> 00:10:55.430
Oh, look, you're here, too.

123
00:10:55.513 --> 00:10:58.934
I'm just teasing.
Stop taking everything so seriously.

124
00:10:59.601 --> 00:11:02.437
Okay. So, Mother,
as I was saying, tomorrow is...

125
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.981
Rapunzel,
Mother's feeling a little run-down.

126
00:11:05.065 --> 00:11:08.068
Would you sing for me, dear?
Then we'll talk.

127
00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:10.487
Of course, Mother.

- Rapunzel!
- So, Mother,

133
00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:30.715
earlier I was saying tomorrow
is a big day, and you didn't respond.

134
00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:33.551
So, I'm just going to tell you,
it's my birthday!

135
00:11:33.635 --> 00:11:36.554
- Ta-da!
- No, no, no. Can't be.

136
00:11:36.638 --> 00:11:39.975
I distinctly remember.
Your birthday was last year.

137
00:11:40.058 --> 00:11:44.396
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.

138
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.734
Mother, I'm turning 18,
and I wanted to ask...

139
00:11:50.735 --> 00:11:52.904
What I really want for this birthday...

140
00:11:53.029 --> 00:11:55.365
Actually what I wanted
for quite a few birthdays now...

141
00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:57.617
Rapunzel, please,
stop with the mumbling.

142
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:00.328
You know how I feel about
the mumbling. Blah-blah-blah-blah.

143
00:12:00.412 --> 00:12:03.081
It's very annoying!
I'm just teasing. You're adorable.

144
00:12:03.164 --> 00:12:05.000
I love you so much, darling.

145
00:12:10.839 --> 00:12:12.507
I want to see the floating lights.

146
00:12:14.926 --> 00:12:16.302
What?

147
00:12:16.386 --> 00:12:20.181
I was hoping you would take me
to see the floating lights.

148
00:12:21.558 --> 00:12:23.351
You mean the stars.

149
00:12:23.643 --> 00:12:24.936
That's the thing.

150
00:12:26.354 --> 00:12:29.274
I've charted stars,
and they're always constant.

151
00:12:29.357 --> 00:12:33.194
But these, they appear every year
on my birthday, Mother.

152
00:12:33.278 --> 00:12:35.238
Only on my birthday.

153
00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:40.493
And I can't help but feel like
they're meant for me.

154
00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:43.246
I need to see them, Mother.

155
00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:46.875
And not just from my window, in person.

156
00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.544
I have to know what they are.

157
00:12:49.627 --> 00:12:53.715

00:14:57.964 --> 00:14:59.257
Yes, Mother.

195
00:15:01.259 --> 00:15:03.511
I love you very much, dear.

196
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.805

00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:30.955
I'll be here.

203
00:15:54.646 --> 00:15:55.980
Oh, no.

204
00:15:57.148 --> 00:15:58.608
This is bad. This is very, very bad.

205
00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.401
This is really bad.

206
00:16:01.819 --> 00:16:03.905
They just can't get my nose right.

207
00:16:03.988 --> 00:16:05.365
Who cares?

208
00:16:05.448 --> 00:16:08.576
It's easy for you to say.
You guys look amazing.

209
00:16:24.008 --> 00:16:26.844
All right. Okay.
Give me a boost and I'll pull you up.

210
00:16:28.346 --> 00:16:29.806
Give us the satchel first.

211
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.604
I can't believe that after all we've been
through together, you don't trust me?

212
00:16:39.023 --> 00:16:40.149
Ouch.

213
00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:50.076
Now help us up, pretty boy!

214
00:16:50.159 --> 00:16:53.037
Sorry, my hands are full.

215
00:16:54.038 --> 00:16:55.164
What?

216
00:16:55.832 --> 00:16:56.874
Rider!

217
00:17:03.381 --> 00:17:05.466
Retrieve that satchel at any cost!

218
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:06.843
Yes, sir!

219
00:17:23.401 --> 00:17:25.945
We got him now, Maximus.

220
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.336
Come on, fleabag! Forward!

221
00:17:43.755 --> 00:17:45.256
No.

222
00:17:45.673 --> 00:17:50.887
Stop it! Stop it!
Give it to me! Give me that!

223
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.532
Alone at last.

224
00:21:10.127 --> 00:21:13.422
Okay. I've got a person in my closet.

225
00:21:13.506 --> 00:21:16.092
I've got a person in my closet.

226
00:21:17.343 --> 00:21:21.180
I've got a person in my closet!

227
00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:26.435
Too weak to handle myself out there,
huh, Mother?

228
00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:29.647
Well, tell that to my frying pan.

229
00:22:11.188 --> 00:22:12.898
Rapunzel!

230
00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:16.402
Let down your hair!

231
00:22:16.944 --> 00:22:18.321
One moment, Mother!

232
00:22:18.404 --> 00:22:20.448
I have a big surprise!

233
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:22.825
I do, too!

234
00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:25.244
I bet my surprise is bigger!

235
00:22:25.536 --> 00:22:27.913
I seriously doubt it.

236
00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:32.668
I brought back parsnips. I'm going
to make hazelnut soup for dinner.

237
00:22:32.752 --> 00:22:35.129
Your favourite. Surprise!

238
00:22:35.212 --> 00:22:37.632
Well, Mother,
there's something I want to tell you.

239
00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:40.551
Oh, Rapunzel, you know I hate
leaving you after a fight.

240
00:22:40.635 --> 00:22:43.095
Especially when I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

241
00:22:43.179 --> 00:22:45.514
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said earlier.

242
00:22:45.598 --> 00:22:48.142
I hope you're not still talking
about the stars.

243
00:22:48.225 --> 00:22:50.645
"Floating lights,"
and, yes, I'm leading up to that.

244
00:22:50.728 --> 00:22:53.230
Because I really thought
we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

245
00:22:53.314 --> 00:22:55.399
No, Mother, I'm just saying,

246
00:22:55.483 --> 00:22:57.985
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.

247
00:22:58.069 --> 00:23:01.322
I know you're not strong enough
to handle yourself out there.

248
00:23:01.405 --> 00:23:04.659
- But if you just...
- We're done talking about this.

249
00:23:04.742 --> 00:23:07.286
- Trust me! I know what I'm...
- Rapunzel.

250
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.914
- Oh, come on!
- Enough with the lights!

251
00:23:09.997 --> 00:23:14.418
You are not leaving this tower! Ever!

252
00:23:20.925 --> 00:23:24.428
Great. Now I'm the bad guy.

253
00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:39.777
All I was going to say, Mother, is that...

254
00:23:40.486 --> 00:23:43.197
I know what I want for my birthday now.

255
00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.282
And what is that?

256
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.034
New paint.

257
00:23:47.702 --> 00:23:51.038
The paint made from the white shells
you once brought me.

258
00:23:51.122 --> 00:23:56.293
That is a very long trip, Rapunzel.
Almost three days' time.

259
00:23:56.544 --> 00:24:01.632
I just thought it was a better idea
than the stars.

260
00:24:05.761 --> 00:24:08.097
You'll be all right on your own?

261
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:11.642
I know I'm safe as long as I'm here.

262
00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.153
<i>I'll be back in three days' time.</i>

263
00:24:23.112 --> 00:24:25.364
<i>I love you very much, dear.</i>

264
00:24:26.323 --> 00:24:27.658
<i>I love you more.</i>

265
00:24:28.659 --> 00:24:30.828
<i>I love you most.</i>

266
00:24:51.515 --> 00:24:52.516
Okay.

267
00:25:38.437 --> 00:25:41.190
Is this hair?

268
00:25:41.899 --> 00:25:45.110
Struggling... Struggling is pointless.

269
00:25:48.656 --> 00:25:53.244
I know why you're here,
and I'm not afraid of you.

270
00:25:53.702 --> 00:25:55.246
What?

271
00:26:03.587 --> 00:26:07.466
Who are you?
And how did you find me?

272
00:26:10.928 --> 00:26:14.265
Who are you, and how did you find me?

273
00:26:17.685 --> 00:26:21.772
I know not who you are,
nor how I came to find you.

274
00:26:21.856 --> 00:26:23.774
But may I just say...

275
00:26:25.109 --> 00:26:26.861
Hi.

276
00:26:29.113 --> 00:26:31.824
How you doing?
The name's Flynn Rider.

277
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:35.286
How's your day going?

278
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:40.291
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Rider?

279
00:26:40.374 --> 00:26:42.501
- All right, blondie.
- Rapunzel.

280
00:26:42.585 --> 00:26:44.253
<i>Gesundheit.</i> Here's the deal.

281
00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:47.214
I was in a situation,
gallivanting through the forest.

282
00:26:47.298 --> 00:26:49.633
I came across your tower and...

283
00:26:51.135 --> 00:26:52.344
Where is my satchel?

284
00:26:52.636 --> 00:26:55.848
I've hidden it.
Somewhere you'll never find it.

285
00:26:58.809 --> 00:27:00.644
It's in that pot, isn't it?

286
00:27:07.526 --> 00:27:09.278
Would you stop that?

287
00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:12.239
Now it's hidden
where you'll never find it.

288
00:27:13.073 --> 00:27:17.077
So, what do you want with my hair?
To cut it?

289
00:27:17.161 --> 00:27:18.412
- What?
- Sell it?

290
00:27:18.495 --> 00:27:22.166
No! Listen, the only thing
I want to do with your hair

291
00:27:22.249 --> 00:27:24.960
is to get out of it, literally.

292
00:27:25.836 --> 00:27:28.464
Wait. You don't want my hair?

293
00:27:28.547 --> 00:27:30.507
Why on earth would I want your hair?

294
00:27:30.591 --> 00:27:33.218
Look, I was being chased,
I saw a tower, I climbed it.

295
00:27:33.302 --> 00:27:35.888
- End of story.
- You're telling the truth?

296
00:27:36.013 --> 00:27:37.306
Yes.

297
00:27:49.568 --> 00:27:52.029
I know. I need someone to take me.

298
00:27:52.905 --> 00:27:55.157
I think he's telling the truth, too.

299
00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.410
He doesn't have fangs.
But what choice do I have?

300
00:28:00.287 --> 00:28:04.291
Okay, Flynn Rider,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

301
00:28:04.375 --> 00:28:06.210
- Deal?
- Look this way.

302
00:28:07.711 --> 00:28:10.589
Do you know what these are?

303
00:28:10.673 --> 00:28:13.801
You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

304
00:28:14.385 --> 00:28:17.805
Lanterns? I knew they weren't stars.

305
00:28:18.889 --> 00:28:21.225
Well, tomorrow evening,

306
00:28:21.308 --> 00:28:25.187
they will light the night sky
with these lanterns.

307
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:28.857
You will act as my guide,
take me to these lanterns,

308
00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:30.526
and return me home safely.

309
00:28:30.609 --> 00:28:34.947
Then, and only then,
will I return your satchel to you.

310
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.240
That is my deal.

311
00:28:36.323 --> 00:28:37.700
Yeah.

312
00:28:38.701 --> 00:28:40.160
No can do.

313
00:28:40.244 --> 00:28:44.039
Unfortunately the kingdom and I
aren't exactly simpatico at the moment,

314
00:28:44.123 --> 00:28:46.417
so I won't be taking you anywhere.

315
00:28:53.007 --> 00:28:56.176
Something brought you here,
Flynn Rider.

316
00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.678
Call it what you will,

317
00:28:57.761 --> 00:29:00.597
- fate, destiny...
- A horse.

318
00:29:00.681 --> 00:29:03.017
So I have made the decision
to trust you.

319
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.143
A horrible decision, really.

320
00:29:04.309 --> 00:29:07.312
But trust me when I tell you this.

321
00:29:09.273 --> 00:29:12.735
You can tear this tower apart
brick by brick,

322
00:29:12.818 --> 00:29:17.573
but without my help, you will never find
your precious satchel.

323
00:29:19.116 --> 00:29:20.451
Let me get this straight.

324
00:29:20.534 --> 00:29:23.746
I take you to see the lanterns,
bring you back home,

325
00:29:23.829 --> 00:29:25.706
and you'll give me back my satchel?

326
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:27.291
I promise.

327
00:29:29.126 --> 00:29:33.839
And when I promise something,
I never, ever break that promise.

328
00:29:36.216 --> 00:29:37.593
Ever.

329
00:29:40.846 --> 00:29:43.223
All right, listen.
I didn't want to have to do this,

330
00:29:43.307 --> 00:29:45.059
but you leave me no choice.

331
00:29:45.809 --> 00:29:47.686
Here comes the smoulder.

332
00:29:55.235 --> 00:29:59.239
This is kind of an off day for me.
This doesn't normally happen.

333
00:29:59.323 --> 00:30:01.116
Fine! I'll take you to see the lanterns.

334
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.576
Really?

335
00:30:03.577 --> 00:30:04.578
Oops.

336
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:06.663
You broke my smoulder.

337
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:14.171
Are you coming, blondie?

I can't believe I did this.
I can't believe I did this!

352
00:32:12.915 --> 00:32:14.750
Mother would be so furious.

353
00:32:14.833 --> 00:32:18.212
But that's okay. What she doesn't know
won't kill her, right?

354
00:32:18.295 --> 00:32:21.089
Oh, my gosh! This would kill her.

355
00:32:21.256 --> 00:32:24.509
This is so fun!

356
00:32:24.968 --> 00:32:27.846
I am a horrible daughter.
I'm going back.

357
00:32:28.222 --> 00:32:30.557
I am never going back!

358
00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:34.728
I am a despicable human being!

359
00:32:36.939 --> 00:32:39.358
Best day ever!

360
00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.870
You know,
I can't help but notice you seem

361
00:32:51.954 --> 00:32:54.498
a little at war with yourself here.

362
00:32:55.332 --> 00:32:57.918
- What?
- I'm only picking up bits and pieces.

363
00:32:58.001 --> 00:33:01.672
Overprotective mother,
forbidden road trip. This is serious stuff.

364
00:33:02.297 --> 00:33:05.384
But let me ease your conscience.
This is part of growing up.

365
00:33:05.467 --> 00:33:09.680
A little rebellion, a little adventure,
that's good. Healthy, even.

366
00:33:11.598 --> 00:33:12.683
You think?

367
00:33:12.766 --> 00:33:15.936
I know. You're way over-thinking this,
trust me.

368
00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:18.063
Does your mother deserve it? No.

369
00:33:18.146 --> 00:33:21.066
Would this break her heart
and crush her soul? Of course.

370
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:23.235
But you've got to do it.

371
00:33:24.069 --> 00:33:25.612
"Break her heart"?

372
00:33:26.071 --> 00:33:28.699
- In half.
- "Crush her soul"?

373
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.909
Like a grape.

374
00:33:30.993 --> 00:33:33.996
She would be heartbroken. You're right.

375
00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:37.624
I am, aren't I? Oh, bother.

376
00:33:38.292 --> 00:33:42.671
All right. I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm letting you out of the deal.

377
00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:45.799
- What?
- That's right, but don't thank me.

378
00:33:45.882 --> 00:33:49.094
Let's turn around and get you home.
Here's your pan, here's your frog.

379
00:33:49.177 --> 00:33:50.429
I get back my satchel,

380
00:33:50.512 --> 00:33:53.849
you get back a mother-daughter
relationship based on mutual trust,

381
00:33:53.932 --> 00:33:57.144
and <i>voilà,</i>
we part ways as unlikely friends.

382
00:33:57.227 --> 00:34:00.272
No. I am seeing those lanterns.

383
00:34:00.355 --> 00:34:03.984
Oh, come on! What is it going to take
for me to get my satchel back?

384
00:34:04.067 --> 00:34:05.694
I will use this.

385
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.950
Is it ruffians? Thugs?
Have they come for me?

386
00:34:16.038 --> 00:34:18.665
Stay calm. It can probably smell fear.

387
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.671
Sorry. Guess I'm just a little bit jumpy.

388
00:34:25.547 --> 00:34:29.468
Probably be best if we avoid ruffians
and thugs, though.

389
00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.763
Yeah, that would probably be best.

390
00:34:34.306 --> 00:34:36.850
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.

391
00:34:38.018 --> 00:34:39.186
Where?

392
00:34:39.269 --> 00:34:41.980
Don't you worry.
You'll know it when you smell it.

393
00:35:20.143 --> 00:35:21.853
A palace horse.

394
00:35:23.063 --> 00:35:24.815
Where's your rider?

395
00:35:27.651 --> 00:35:28.985
Rapunzel!

396
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:40.080
Rapunzel! Let down your hair!

397
00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:56.865
I know it's around here somewhere.

398
00:36:57.616 --> 00:37:01.161
Ah, there it is! The Snuggly Duckling.

399
00:37:01.495 --> 00:37:04.164
Don't worry. Very quaint place.
Perfect for you.

400
00:37:04.247 --> 00:37:07.542
Don't want you scaring and giving up
on this whole endeavour now, do we?

401
00:37:07.626 --> 00:37:11.087
- Well, I do like ducklings.
- Yay!

402
00:37:12.714 --> 00:37:15.050
Garçon, your finest table, please!

403
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:25.185
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.

404
00:37:25.477 --> 00:37:27.812
Really let that seep in.
What are you getting?

405
00:37:27.896 --> 00:37:31.608
To me, it's part man-smell and the other
part is really bad man-smell.

406
00:37:31.691 --> 00:37:34.486
I don't know why, but overall it smells
like the colour brown. Your thoughts?

407
00:37:35.946 --> 00:37:38.323
That's a lot of hair.

408
00:37:38.406 --> 00:37:40.742
She's growing it out.
Is that blood in your moustache?

409
00:37:40.825 --> 00:37:43.495
Goldie, look at all the blood
in his moustache!

410
00:37:43.787 --> 00:37:45.664
Good sir, that's a lot of blood!

411
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:51.378
You don't look so good, blondie. Maybe
we should get you home, call it a day.

412
00:37:51.461 --> 00:37:54.381
Probably better off.
This is a five-star joint.

413
00:37:54.464 --> 00:37:57.676
If you can't handle this place, maybe
you should be back in your tower.

414
00:37:58.969 --> 00:38:00.345
Is this you?

415
00:38:03.473 --> 00:38:05.308
- Now they're just being mean.
- It's him, all right.

416
00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:09.479
Greno, go find some guards.

417
00:38:09.563 --> 00:38:12.941
That reward
is going to buy me a new hook.

418
00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:16.486
- I could use the money.
- What about me? I'm broke!

419
00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:17.571
Get back!

420
00:38:17.821 --> 00:38:18.947
- Mine!
- Ruffians, stop!

421
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.908
- We can work this out!
- Leave him alone!

422
00:38:21.992 --> 00:38:23.201
Gentlemen, please!

423
00:38:23.285 --> 00:38:26.663
Give me back my guide! Ruffians!

424
00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.590
Not the nose! Not the nose!

425
00:38:39.634 --> 00:38:41.386
Put him down!

426
00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:48.101
I don't know where I am, and I need him
to take me to see the lanterns

427
00:38:48.184 --> 00:38:51.104
because I've been dreaming about them
my entire life!

428
00:38:51.187 --> 00:38:56.151
Find your humanity!
Haven't any of you ever had a dream?

429
00:39:08.038 --> 00:39:10.874

Where's Rider? Where is he?

486
00:42:38.373 --> 00:42:40.500
I know he's in here somewhere.
Find him.

487
00:42:40.583 --> 00:42:42.627
Turn the place upside down
if you have to!

488
00:42:59.185 --> 00:43:01.271
Go. Live your dream.

489
00:43:02.105 --> 00:43:04.190
- I will.
- Your dream stinks.

490
00:43:04.274 --> 00:43:06.067
I was talking to her.

491
00:43:07.777 --> 00:43:09.696
Thanks for everything.

492
00:43:13.199 --> 00:43:15.869
I believe
this is the man you're looking for.

493
00:43:15.952 --> 00:43:17.829
You got me!

494
00:43:18.371 --> 00:43:20.623
Sir, there's no sign of Rider.

495
00:43:24.586 --> 00:43:25.587
Maximus!

496
00:43:33.636 --> 00:43:35.471
What's he doing?

497
00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:46.941
A passage! Come on, men. Let's go.

498
00:43:47.901 --> 00:43:50.737
Conti! Make sure those boys
don't get away.

499
00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:56.492
Play it safe

500
00:43:58.202 --> 00:43:59.996
or go get the crown?

501
00:44:08.004 --> 00:44:11.925
<i>I got a dream
I got some dreams</i>

502
00:44:14.302 --> 00:44:16.512
Somebody get me a glass!

503
00:44:16.596 --> 00:44:20.350
Because I just found me
a tall drink of water.

504
00:44:21.017 --> 00:44:23.186
Oh, stop it, you big lug.

505
00:44:25.021 --> 00:44:26.940
Where does that tunnel let out?

506
00:44:27.023 --> 00:44:28.441
Knife!

507
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:35.782
I didn't know you had that in you
back there. That was pretty impressive.

508
00:44:35.865 --> 00:44:37.158
I know!

509
00:44:38.868 --> 00:44:40.328
I know.

510
00:44:43.331 --> 00:44:46.668
So... Flynn? Where are you from?

511
00:44:46.751 --> 00:44:49.212
Whoa! Sorry, blondie,
I don't do back-story.

512
00:44:49.295 --> 00:44:51.881
However, I am becoming
very interested in yours.

513
00:44:51.965 --> 00:44:54.550
I know I'm not supposed
to mention the hair.

514
00:44:54.634 --> 00:44:56.177
- Nope.
- Or the mother.

515
00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.888
- Uh-uh.
- I'm too scared to ask about the frog.

516
00:44:59.055 --> 00:45:00.431
- Chameleon.
- Nuance.

517
00:45:00.723 --> 00:45:05.228
Here's my question, though,
if you want to see the lanterns so badly

518
00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:07.230
why haven't you gone before?

519
00:45:09.857 --> 00:45:11.067
Well...

520
00:45:18.241 --> 00:45:19.367
Flynn?

521
00:45:19.909 --> 00:45:21.119
Rider?

522
00:45:21.202 --> 00:45:23.162
Run. Run!

523
00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:43.808
- Who's that?
- They don't like me.

524
00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:47.145
- Who's that?
- They don't like me either.

525
00:45:47.228 --> 00:45:48.312
Who's that?

526
00:45:48.396 --> 00:45:51.357
Let's assume that everyone in here
doesn't like me.

527
00:45:51.441 --> 00:45:52.608
Here.

528
00:46:01.617 --> 00:46:03.703
I waited a long time for this.

529
00:46:13.129 --> 00:46:16.799
Oh, mama!
I have got to get me one of these!

530
00:46:25.141 --> 00:46:29.479
You should know that this
is the strangest thing I've ever done!

531
00:46:34.734 --> 00:46:36.652
How about two out of three?

532
00:46:43.284 --> 00:46:44.827
Flynn, look out!

533
00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:52.168
You should see your faces,
because you look...

534
00:46:53.086 --> 00:46:54.670
...ridiculous.

535
00:47:01.803 --> 00:47:04.514
Come on, blondie! Jump!

536
00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:36.522
It's no use. I can't see anything.

537
00:48:41.944 --> 00:48:45.114
Hey, there's no point.
It's pitch-black down there.

538
00:48:53.164 --> 00:48:54.999
This is all my fault.

539
00:48:56.709 --> 00:48:59.795
She was right.
I never should have done this.

540
00:49:05.968 --> 00:49:08.054
I'm so sorry, Flynn.

541
00:49:15.811 --> 00:49:17.021
Eugene.

542
00:49:18.481 --> 00:49:19.607
What?

543
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:23.152
My real name is Eugene Fitzherbert.

544
00:49:24.737 --> 00:49:26.822
Someone might as well know.

545
00:49:29.659 --> 00:49:32.453
I have magic hair
that glows when I sing.

546
00:49:33.162 --> 00:49:34.330
What?

547
00:49:36.207 --> 00:49:40.253
I have magic hair that glows
when I sing!

548
00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:44.548
<i>Flower gleam and glow
Let your power shine</i>

549
00:50:35.224 --> 00:50:36.809
We made it.

550
00:50:36.892 --> 00:50:40.354
- Her hair glows.
- We're alive. I'm alive!

551
00:50:40.438 --> 00:50:44.025
I didn't see that coming.
The hair actually glows.

552
00:50:44.108 --> 00:50:45.735
- Why does her hair glow?
- Eugene!

553
00:50:45.818 --> 00:50:46.819
What?

554
00:50:48.529 --> 00:50:50.823
It doesn't just glow.

555
00:50:53.242 --> 00:50:55.286
Why is he smiling at me?

556
00:51:19.435 --> 00:51:22.271
I'll kill him. I'll kill that Rider!

557
00:51:23.773 --> 00:51:27.777
We'll cut him off at the kingdom
and get back the crown. Come on!

558
00:51:29.028 --> 00:51:30.446
Or...

559
00:51:32.239 --> 00:51:35.159
Perhaps you want to stop
acting like wild dogs

560
00:51:35.242 --> 00:51:38.621
chasing their tails
and think for a moment.

561
00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:43.250
Oh, please, there's no need for that.

562
00:51:48.756 --> 00:51:52.385
Well, if that's all you desire,
then be on your way.

563
00:51:52.468 --> 00:51:55.471
I was going to offer you something
worth 1,000 crowns.

564
00:51:55.554 --> 00:51:57.181
Would have made you
rich beyond belief,

565
00:51:57.264 --> 00:51:59.058
and that wasn't even the best part.

566
00:51:59.141 --> 00:52:03.145
Oh, well. <i>C'est la vie.</i> Enjoy your crown!

567
00:52:04.647 --> 00:52:06.315
What's the best part?

568
00:52:06.816 --> 00:52:11.779
It comes with revenge on Flynn Rider.

569
00:52:18.786 --> 00:52:20.621
You're being strangely cryptic

570
00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:23.999
as you wrap your magic hair
around my injured hand.

571
00:52:24.667 --> 00:52:26.001
Sorry.

572
00:52:27.169 --> 00:52:31.215

583

I'm not freaking out.
Are you freaking out?

584
00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:39.200
I'm just interested in your hair
and the magical qualities it possesses.

585
00:53:39.283 --> 00:53:42.077
How long has it been
doing that exactly?

586
00:53:43.329 --> 00:53:45.664
Forever, I guess.

587
00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:49.835
Mother says when I was a baby,
people tried to cut it.

588
00:53:49.919 --> 00:53:51.837
They wanted to take it for themselves.

589
00:53:52.421 --> 00:53:57.343
But once it's cut,
it turns brown and loses its power.

590
00:53:58.177 --> 00:54:01.305
A gift like that, it has to be protected.

591
00:54:02.264 --> 00:54:04.683
That's why Mother never let me...

592
00:54:08.103 --> 00:54:11.106
That's why I never left and...

593
00:54:14.527 --> 00:54:16.570
You never left that tower.

594
00:54:20.282 --> 00:54:22.451
And you're still going to go back?

595
00:54:22.743 --> 00:54:24.995
No! Yes.

596
00:54:27.164 --> 00:54:29.124
It's complicated.

597
00:54:39.635 --> 00:54:42.638
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

598
00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:44.765
Ah, yeah. Well...

599
00:54:44.848 --> 00:54:48.185
I'll spare you the sob story
of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert.

600
00:54:48.269 --> 00:54:51.564
It's a little bit of a downer.

601
00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:01.824
There was this book I used to read
every night to all the younger kids.

602
00:55:01.907 --> 00:55:03.576
<i>The Tales of Flynnagan Rider.</i>

603
00:55:03.659 --> 00:55:08.247
Swashbuckling rogue, richest man
alive, not bad with the ladies either.

604
00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:10.916
Not that he'd ever brag about it,
of course.

605
00:55:11.458 --> 00:55:13.210
Was he a thief, too?

606
00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:16.505
Well, no.

607
00:55:17.131 --> 00:55:20.009
He had enough money to do anything
that he wanted to do.

608
00:55:20.092 --> 00:55:21.677
He could go anywhere
that he wanted to go.

609
00:55:22.428 --> 00:55:26.432
And for a kid with nothing,
I don't know, I...

610
00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.852
Just seemed like the better option.

611
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.480
You can't tell anyone about this, okay?

612
00:55:33.897 --> 00:55:36.025
It could ruin my whole reputation.

613
00:55:37.234 --> 00:55:38.694
We wouldn't want that.

614
00:55:38.777 --> 00:55:41.363
A fake reputation is all a man has.

615
00:55:49.413 --> 00:55:51.165
Well, I should...

616
00:55:52.374 --> 00:55:54.710
I should get some more firewood.

617
00:55:57.379 --> 00:56:03.052
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert
much better than Flynn Rider.

618
00:56:06.221 --> 00:56:09.391
Then you'd be the first. But thank you.

619
00:56:19.193 --> 00:56:22.488
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

620
00:56:22.571 --> 00:56:23.947
Mother?

621
00:56:24.031 --> 00:56:25.532
Hello, dear.

622
00:56:28.661 --> 00:56:29.953
How did you find me?

623
00:56:30.245 --> 00:56:32.122
It was easy, really.

624
00:56:32.206 --> 00:56:36.585
I just listened for the sound of complete
and utter betrayal and followed that.

625
00:56:39.296 --> 00:56:43.175
- We're going home. Now.
- You don't understand.

626
00:56:43.258 --> 00:56:47.680
I've been on this incredible journey,
and I've seen and learned so much.

627
00:56:48.597 --> 00:56:49.765
I even met someone.

628
00:56:49.848 --> 00:56:52.935
Yes, the wanted thief. I'm so proud.
Come on.

629
00:56:53.268 --> 00:56:55.938
Mother, wait. I think...

630
00:56:57.648 --> 00:56:59.149
I think he likes me.

631
00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.111

657

Is there any chance that I'm going to get
super strength in my hand?

658
00:58:39.792 --> 00:58:43.253
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.

659
00:58:44.296 --> 00:58:45.756
Hey, you all right?

660
00:58:47.174 --> 00:58:52.012
Sorry, yes. Just lost in thought, I guess.

661
00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.808
Here's the thing,

662
00:58:55.891 --> 00:58:59.186
superhuman good looks,
I've always had them. Born with it.

663
00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:03.482
But superhuman strength. Can you
imagine the possibilities of this?

664
00:59:07.736 --> 00:59:09.738
Patience, boys.

665
00:59:10.364 --> 00:59:14.535
All good things to those who wait.

666
00:59:33.929 --> 00:59:36.431
Well, I hope you're here to apologise.

667
00:59:39.434 --> 00:59:42.020
No, put me down. Stop it! No!

668
00:59:42.104 --> 00:59:44.106
Let me go!

669
00:59:44.815 --> 00:59:46.608
Give me him!

670
00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.694
Stop, stop, stop!

671
00:59:58.787 --> 01:00:00.789
Easy, boy. Easy! Settle down.

672
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.376
Easy, boy. Easy.

673
01:00:04.668 --> 01:00:06.420
Easy.

674
01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:09.756
That's it.

675
01:00:13.093 --> 01:00:14.177
Now sit.

676
01:00:15.971 --> 01:00:17.097
Sit!

677
01:00:17.639 --> 01:00:19.641
- What?
- Now drop the boot.

678
01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:21.476
Drop it.

679
01:00:24.062 --> 01:00:28.525
You're such a good boy! Yes, you are!

680
01:00:30.068 --> 01:00:33.655
You all tired from chasing this bad man
all over the place?

681
01:00:33.739 --> 01:00:37.618
- Excuse me?
- Nobody appreciates you, do they?

682
01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:38.869
Do they?

683
01:00:38.952 --> 01:00:40.996
Oh, come on. He's a bad horse!

684
01:00:41.079 --> 01:00:43.707
Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.

685
01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:46.293
Isn't that right...

686
01:00:46.835 --> 01:00:48.337
Maximus?

687
01:00:49.004 --> 01:00:51.423
You've got to be kidding me.

688
01:00:51.506 --> 01:00:56.219
Look. Today is kind of
the biggest day of my life,

689
01:00:56.803 --> 01:01:00.682
and the thing is,
I need you not to get him arrested.

690
01:01:01.433 --> 01:01:02.643
Just for 24 hours,

691
01:01:02.726 --> 01:01:06.563
and then you can chase each other
to your heart's content.

692
01:01:11.276 --> 01:01:14.821
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.

693
01:02:06.581 --> 01:02:08.250
Excuse me. Sorry.

694
01:02:31.106 --> 01:02:33.025
Thank you!

695
01:02:48.707 --> 01:02:50.542
It's for the lost princess.

696
01:04:09.204 --> 01:04:10.747
To the boats!

697
01:04:22.008 --> 01:04:23.051
Hey, Max!

698
01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:29.307
What? I bought them.

699
01:04:32.185 --> 01:04:33.645
Most of them.

700
01:04:35.355 --> 01:04:36.940
Where are we going?

701
01:04:37.023 --> 01:04:40.902
Best day of your life?
I figured you should have a decent seat.

702
01:04:59.421 --> 01:05:00.797
You okay?

703
01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:03.258
I'm terrified.

704
01:05:04.134 --> 01:05:05.427
Why?

705
01:05:06.219 --> 01:05:10.515
I've been looking out a window
for 18 years,

706
01:05:10.599 --> 01:05:15.437
dreaming about what it might feel like
when those lights rise in the sky.

707
01:05:16.897 --> 01:05:20.400
What if it's not everything
that I dreamed it would be?

708
01:05:22.944 --> 01:05:24.321
It will be.

709
01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:30.410
And what if it is? What do I do then?

710
01:05:30.869 --> 01:05:35.790
That's the good part, I guess.
You get to go find a new dream.

any more. You know what I mean?

730
01:08:48.775 --> 01:08:50.985

01:10:47.894 --> 01:10:49.103
Oh, yes.

751
01:10:50.021 --> 01:10:52.857
Yes, of course. I just...

752
01:10:58.613 --> 01:11:00.949
I'm sorry. Everything is fine.

753
01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:03.576
There's just something
I have to take care of.

754
01:11:06.454 --> 01:11:07.539
Okay.

755
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:11.084
I'll be right back.

756
01:11:17.257 --> 01:11:19.133
It's all right, Pascal.

757
01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:28.393
There you are!

758
01:11:28.476 --> 01:11:31.062
I've been searching everywhere
for you guys since we got separated.

759
01:11:31.145 --> 01:11:35.400
The sideburns are coming in nice, huh?
Got to be excited about that.

760
01:11:39.112 --> 01:11:41.864
Anyhow, I just wanted to say
I shouldn't have split.

761
01:11:41.948 --> 01:11:47.412
The crown is all yours. I'll miss you,
but I think it's for the best.

762
01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.500
Holding out on us again, eh, Rider?

763
01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:55.878
- What?
- We heard you found something.

764
01:11:55.962 --> 01:11:58.840
Something much more valuable
than a crown.

765
01:11:59.841 --> 01:12:02.677
We want her instead.

766
01:12:12.937 --> 01:12:16.190
I was starting to think you ran off
with the crown and left me.

767
01:12:23.239 --> 01:12:24.866
He did.

768
01:12:24.991 --> 01:12:28.202
What? No. He wouldn't.

769
01:12:29.162 --> 01:12:30.830
See for yourself.

770
01:12:35.710 --> 01:12:36.794
Eugene?

771
01:12:39.505 --> 01:12:41.424
Eugene!

772
01:12:43.676 --> 01:12:48.640
A fair trade. A crown
for the girl with the magic hair.

773
01:12:49.849 --> 01:12:53.645
How much do you think someone would
pay to stay young and healthy forever?

774
01:12:53.728 --> 01:12:56.648
No. Please. No!

775
01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.533
Rapunzel!

776
01:13:09.243 --> 01:13:10.662
Mother?

777
01:13:15.541 --> 01:13:18.044
Oh, my precious girl!

778
01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.171
Mother.

779
01:13:20.713 --> 01:13:23.091
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

780
01:13:23.174 --> 01:13:26.719
- How did you...
- I was so worried about you, dear.

781
01:13:26.803 --> 01:13:30.348
So I followed you.
And I saw them attack you and...

782
01:13:30.431 --> 01:13:33.101
Oh, my. Let's go before they come to!

783
01:14:03.297 --> 01:14:07.260
You were right, Mother.
You were right about everything.

784
01:14:08.428 --> 01:14:11.806
I know, darling. I know.

785
01:14:25.653 --> 01:14:26.738
Look!

786
01:14:27.321 --> 01:14:28.698
The crown!

787
01:14:34.996 --> 01:14:37.749
No! Wait, guys!

788
01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:03.691
Let's get this over with, Rider.

789
01:15:05.777 --> 01:15:07.111
Where are we going?

790
01:15:14.952 --> 01:15:17.705
There. It never happened.

791
01:15:19.957 --> 01:15:24.879
Now, wash up for dinner.
I'm making hazelnut soup.

792
01:15:29.509 --> 01:15:34.680
I really did try, Rapunzel.
I tried to warn you what was out there.

793
01:15:35.348 --> 01:15:39.811
The world is dark and selfish and cruel.

794
01:15:39.894 --> 01:15:42.897
If it finds
even the slightest ray of sunshine,

795
01:15:43.815 --> 01:15:45.566
it destroys it.

796
01:17:28.294 --> 01:17:30.463
How did you know about her?
Tell me, now!

797
01:17:30.546 --> 01:17:33.382
It wasn't us! It was the old lady!

798
01:17:33.466 --> 01:17:34.717
Old lady?

799
01:17:36.177 --> 01:17:38.346
Wait. No! Wait!

800
01:17:38.429 --> 01:17:41.349
You don't understand!
She's in trouble! Wait!

801
01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.354
What's going on up there?

802
01:17:50.524 --> 01:17:52.193
Are you all right?

803
01:17:53.527 --> 01:17:55.071
I'm the lost princess.

804
01:17:55.738 --> 01:17:58.950
Please speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.

805
01:17:59.033 --> 01:18:03.621
I am the lost princess. Aren't I?

806
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:08.042
Did I mumble, Mother?

807
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:11.712
Or should I even call you that?

808
01:18:12.964 --> 01:18:15.800
Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

809
01:18:15.883 --> 01:18:18.594
Why would you ask
such a ridiculous question?

810
01:18:18.678 --> 01:18:22.139
It was you! It was all you!

811
01:18:24.225 --> 01:18:27.728
Everything I did was to protect you.

812
01:18:29.855 --> 01:18:34.902
I've spent my entire life hiding from
people who would use me for my power

813
01:18:35.903 --> 01:18:38.906
when I should have been hiding
from you!

814
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:42.284
Where will you go?
He won't be there for you.

815
01:18:42.368 --> 01:18:44.245
<i>What did you do to him?</i>

816
01:18:44.745 --> 01:18:47.999
<i>That criminal is to be hanged
for his crimes.</i>

817
01:18:49.083 --> 01:18:51.502
- No.
- Now, now, it's all right.

818
01:18:51.585 --> 01:18:56.173
Listen to me.
All of this is as it should be.

819
01:18:56.590 --> 01:19:00.094
No! You were wrong about the world.

820
01:19:00.636 --> 01:19:03.139
And you were wrong about me!

821
01:19:03.222 --> 01:19:07.268
And I will never
let you use my hair again!

822
01:19:16.402 --> 01:19:18.863
You want me to be the bad guy?

823
01:19:18.946 --> 01:19:22.783
Fine, now I'm the bad guy.

824
01:19:36.964 --> 01:19:38.549
What's this?

825
01:19:38.632 --> 01:19:40.468
Open up!

826
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:43.554
- What's the password?
- What?

827
01:19:43.637 --> 01:19:45.890
- Nope.
- Open this door!

828
01:19:45.973 --> 01:19:47.808
Not even close!

829
01:19:47.975 --> 01:19:50.728
You have three seconds! One...

830
01:19:51.645 --> 01:19:53.022
Two...

831
01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:55.983
Three.

832
01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:03.824
Frying pans! Who knew, right?

833
01:20:33.312 --> 01:20:34.605
- Head down.
- Head down.

834
01:20:34.688 --> 01:20:35.773
- Arms in.
- Arms in.

835
01:20:35.856 --> 01:20:37.525
- Knees apart.
- Knees apart. Knees apart?

836
01:20:38.692 --> 01:20:40.528
Why do I need
to keep my knees apart...

837
01:20:48.702 --> 01:20:51.914
Max! You brought them here?

838
01:20:54.125 --> 01:20:55.167
Thank you.

839
01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:59.213
No, really. Thank you.

840
01:21:01.132 --> 01:21:02.466
I feel maybe this whole time,

841
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:04.468
we've just been misunderstanding
one another,

842
01:21:04.552 --> 01:21:06.262
and we're really just...

843
01:21:06.637 --> 01:21:07.930
You're right, we should go.

844
01:21:15.563 --> 01:21:16.605
Max?

845
01:21:30.369 --> 01:21:33.539
Okay, Max.
Let's see how fast you can run.

846
01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:54.018
Rapunzel?

847
01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:57.605
Rapunzel, let down your hair!

848
01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:16.290
Rapunzel,
I thought I'd never see you again.

849
01:22:24.423 --> 01:22:27.343
Now look what you've done, Rapunzel.

850
01:22:27.426 --> 01:22:31.764
Oh, don't worry, dear.
Our secret will die with him.

851
01:22:33.474 --> 01:22:35.059
And as for us...

852
01:22:36.393 --> 01:22:41.023
We are going where no one
will ever find you again.

853
01:22:47.112 --> 01:22:48.781
Rapunzel, really!

854
01:22:49.615 --> 01:22:53.244
Enough already! Stop fighting me!

855
01:22:53.869 --> 01:22:55.913
No! I won't stop!

856
01:22:55.996 --> 01:22:59.208
For every minute of the rest of my life,
I will fight!

857
01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:03.170
I will never stop trying
to get away from you!

858
01:23:05.589 --> 01:23:10.135
But if you let me save him,
I will go with you.

859
01:23:10.886 --> 01:23:13.847
No! No, Rapunzel.

860
01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:17.977
I'll never run. I'll never try to escape.

861
01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:21.647
Just let me heal him
and you and I will be together,

862
01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.774
forever, just like you want.

863
01:23:23.857 --> 01:23:25.859
Everything will be the way it was.

864
01:23:27.194 --> 01:23:28.320
I promise.

865
01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:31.031
Just like you want.

866
01:23:34.034 --> 01:23:37.371
Just let me heal him.

867
01:23:42.918 --> 01:23:46.297
In case you get any ideas
about following us.

868
01:23:56.598 --> 01:23:58.934
I'm so sorry.
Everything is going to be okay, though.

869
01:23:59.018 --> 01:24:00.019
No, Rapunzel.

870
01:24:00.102 --> 01:24:03.480
I promise. You have to trust me.
Come on. Just breathe.

871
01:24:03.564 --> 01:24:05.232
I can't let you do this.

872
01:24:05.899 --> 01:24:08.027
And I can't let you die.

873
01:24:08.569 --> 01:24:12.239
But if you do then you will die.

874
01:24:12.323 --> 01:24:16.035
Hey. It's going to be all right.

875
01:24:23.334 --> 01:24:24.460
Wait.

876
01:24:33.385 --> 01:24:34.636
Eugene...

877
01:24:35.596 --> 01:24:36.764
No!

878
01:24:44.938 --> 01:24:48.567
What have you done?
What have you done?

879
01:25:27.481 --> 01:25:29.358
No, no, no. Eugene.

880
01:25:32.111 --> 01:25:36.490
No! Look at me. I'm right here.
Don't go. Stay with me.

You were my new dream.

885
01:25:54.675 --> 01:25:56.427

01:27:46.286 --> 01:27:47.663
Eugene?

893
01:27:49.706 --> 01:27:52.668
Did I ever tell you
I've got a thing for brunettes?

894
01:29:35.604 --> 01:29:38.899
<i>Well, you can imagine
what happened next.</i>

895
01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:44.946
<i>The kingdom rejoiced,
for their lost princess had returned.</i>

896
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:49.743
<i>The party lasted an entire week, and
honestly I don't remember most of it.</i>

897
01:29:50.577 --> 01:29:52.371
<i>Dreams came true all over the place.</i>

898
01:29:52.454 --> 01:29:55.749
<i>That guy went on to become the most
famous concert pianist in the world,</i>

899
01:29:55.832 --> 01:29:57.501
<i>if you can believe it!</i>

900
01:29:59.086 --> 01:30:02.464
<i>And this guy?
He eventually found true love.</i>

901
01:30:03.423 --> 01:30:07.594
<i>As for this guy, I assume he's happy.
He's never told me otherwise.</i>

902
01:30:09.805 --> 01:30:10.889
<i>Thanks to Maximus,</i>

903
01:30:10.972 --> 01:30:14.059
<i>crime in the kingdom
disappeared almost overnight.</i>

904
01:30:15.602 --> 01:30:17.646
<i>As did most of the apples.</i>

905
01:30:19.398 --> 01:30:22.275
<i>Pascal never changed.</i>

906
01:30:26.363 --> 01:30:30.367
<i>At last Rapunzel was home.
And she finally had a real family.</i>

907
01:30:32.119 --> 01:30:34.705
<i>She was a princess worth waiting for.</i>

908
01:30:34.788 --> 01:30:38.250
<i>Beloved by all, she led her kingdom
with all the grace and wisdom</i>

909
01:30:38.333 --> 01:30:39.793
<i>that her parents did before her.</i>

910
01:30:41.128 --> 01:30:44.256
<i>And, as for me,
I started going by Eugene again,</i>

<i>stopped thieving
and turned it all around.</i>

912
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:49.094
<i>But I know what the big question is.</i>

913
01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:51.346
<i>Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?</i>

914
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:52.556
<i>I'm pleased to tell you</i>

915
01:30:52.639 --> 01:30:57.018
<i>that after years and years
of asking and asking and asking...</i>

916
01:30:59.146 --> 01:31:01.022
<i>I finally said yes.</i>

917
01:31:01.106 --> 01:31:05.402
<i>- Eugene.
- All right, I asked her.</i>

918
01:31:05.485 --> 01:31:07.946
<i>And we're living happily ever after.</i>

919
01:31:08.613 --> 01:31:10.073
<i>Yes, we are.</i>
