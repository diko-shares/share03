1
00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:57.984
This is the story of how I died.

2
00:00:59.412 --> 00:01:03.628
Don't worry, this is actually a very fun
story. And the truth is, it isn't even mine.

3
00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.177
This is the story of
a girl named, Rapunzel.

4
00:01:07.883 --> 00:01:10.628
And it starts, with the sun.

5
00:01:12.183 --> 00:01:17.099
Now, once upon a time, a single drop
of sunlight fell from the heavens.

6
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.802
And from this small drop of sun,
grew a magic, golden, flower.

7
00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:27.135
It had the ability to
heal the sick, and injured.

8
00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:30.247
Oh, you see that old woman, over there?

9
00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:32.153
You might want to remember her.

10
00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:33.946
She's kind of important.

11
00:01:34.812 --> 00:01:39.618
Well, centuries pass and a hop skip and
a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.

12
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:42.979
The kingdom was ruled by
a beloved King and Queen.

13
00:01:44.196 --> 00:01:47.115
And the Queen, well she
was about to have a baby,

14
00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:49.597
but she got sick,

15
00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:51.395
really, sick.

16
00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:52.836
She was running out of time.

17
00:01:52.837 --> 00:01:55.335
And that's when people usually
start to look for a miracle.

18
00:01:55.336 --> 00:01:58.888
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.

19
00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.457
Ahhh, I told you she'd be important.

20
00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.769
You see instead of
sharing the suns gift,

21
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.847
this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded its healing power

22
00:02:07.848 --> 00:02:10.755
and used it to keep herself
young for hundreds of years.

23
00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:14.836
And all she had to do,
was sing a special song.

24
00:02:14.837 --> 00:02:22.804
*Flower gleam and glow,
let your power shine*

25
00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:31.109
*Make the clock reverse,
bring back what once was mine*

26
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.811
*What once was mine*

27
00:02:35.812 --> 00:02:38.826
All right, you get the jist. She sings
to it, she turns young, creepy, right?

28
00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:52.089
We've found it!

29
00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:01.199
The magic of the golden
flower, healed the queen.

30
00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:06.097
A healthy baby girl,
a princess was born.

31
00:03:06.098 --> 00:03:08.198
With beautiful golden hair.

32
00:03:16.615 --> 00:03:17.836
I'll give you a hint.

33
00:03:17.838 --> 00:03:19.614
That's Rapunzel.

34
00:03:21.214 --> 00:03:27.173
To celebrate her birth, the King and Queen
launched a flying lantern into the sky.

35
00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:34.950
And for that one moment,
everything was perfect.

36
00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:39.726
And then that moment ended.

37
00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:50.256
*Flower, gleam and glow,
let your powers shine*

38
00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:53.538
*Make the clock re...* HUH!

39
00:03:59.464 --> 00:04:01.298
Gothel broke into the castle,

40
00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.149
stole the child, and
just like that...gone.

41
00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:09.753
The Kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the Princess.

42
00:04:09.758 --> 00:04:11.620
For deep within the forest

43
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:13.157
In a hidden tower.

44
00:04:13.157 --> 00:04:15.074
Gothel raised the child as her own.

45
00:04:15.075 --> 00:04:25.000
*...bring what has been lost, bring back
what once was mine, what once was mine.*

46
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.037
Gothel had found her new magic flower.

47
00:04:27.038 --> 00:04:30.380
But this time she was
determined to keep it hidden.

48
00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:33.196
Why can't I go outside?

49
00:04:33.197 --> 00:04:36.267
The outside world is a dangerous place.

50
00:04:36.268 --> 00:04:38.622
Filled with horrible, selfish people.

51
00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:44.633
- You must stay here, where you're safe. Do you understand, flower?
- Yes, Mommy.

52
00:04:48.142 --> 00:04:50.967
But the walls of that tower,
could not hide everything.

53
00:04:56.124 --> 00:05:00.734
Each year on her birthday, the King and Queen
released thousands of lanterns into the sky.

54
00:05:00.736 --> 00:05:06.515
In hope that one day, their
lost Princess, would return.

55
00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:32.469
Hmm, Well I guess Pascal's
not hiding out here.

56
00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:36.069
GOTCHA!

57
00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:40.283
That's twenty two for me.

58
00:05:40.284 --> 00:05:42.908
How about twenty three,
out of forty five?

59
00:05:43.797 --> 00:05:46.339
Okay, well, what do you want to do?

60
00:05:48.763 --> 00:05:51.155
Yeah, I don't think so.

61
00:05:51.453 --> 00:05:54.015
I like it in here and so do you.

62
00:05:55.747 --> 00:05:59.427
Oh, come on Pascal,
it's not so bad in there.

63
00:06:10.868 --> 00:06:12.270
*Sings "When will my life begin"*

64
00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:16.514
*7a.m. the usual morning line
- up*

65
00:06:16.515 --> 00:06:19.732
*Start on the chores I sweep
'til the floors all clean.*

66
00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:24.589
*Polish and wax, do laundry
and mop and shine up.*

67
00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:29.478
*Sweep again, and by
then it's like 7:15.*

68
00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.797
*So I'll read a book,
or maybe two or three.*

69
00:06:33.798 --> 00:06:38.505
*Ill add a few new
paintings to my gallery.*

70
00:06:38.506 --> 00:06:42.921
*I'll play guitar, and 
knit, and cook and basically.*

71
00:06:42.922 --> 00:06:46.967
*Just wonder when will my life, begin.*

72
00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.406
*Then after lunch, it's
puzzles, and darts and baking.*

73
00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:04.926
*Papier-mache? a bit
of ballet, and chess.*

74
00:07:04.927 --> 00:07:09.140
*Pottery, and ventriloquy,
candle making.*

75
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:16.464
*Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch. Take a climb, sew a dress, and I'll re
- read the books.*

76
00:07:16.465 --> 00:07:22.121
*If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall
some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.*

77
00:07:22.121 --> 00:07:27.212
*And then I'll brush, and brush,
and brush, and brush my hair.*

78
00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:31.510
*Stuck in the same
place I've always been.*

79
00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:35.531
*And I'll keep wondering, and
wondering, and wondering...*

80
00:07:35.532 --> 00:07:40.789
*Wondering, when will my life begin?*

81
00:07:42.304 --> 00:07:49.652
*Tomorrow night, the
lights will appear.*

82
00:07:49.653 --> 00:07:58.698
*Just like they do on
my birthday, each year.*

83
00:07:59.933 --> 00:08:09.044
*What is it like, out
there where they glow?*

84
00:08:09.045 --> 00:08:17.952
*Now that I'm older. Mother
might just let me go.*

85
00:08:42.994 --> 00:08:45.564
I could get used to a view like this.

86
00:08:45.565 --> 00:08:48.031
- Ryder, come on.
- Hold on.

87
00:08:48.842 --> 00:08:52.614
Yep, I'm used to it.
Guys I want a castle.

88
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:56.196
We do this job, you
could buy your own castle.

89
00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:09.347
Oh, hay fever?

90
00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:10.417
Yeah.

91
00:09:12.104 --> 00:09:13.179
Huh?

92
00:09:14.141 --> 00:09:16.527
Wait, wait. Hey, wait!

93
00:09:17.434 --> 00:09:19.800
Can't you picture me
in a castle of my own?

94
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:20.885
'Cause I certainly can.

95
00:09:20.886 --> 00:09:23.418
Oh, the things we've seen and
it's only eight in the morning.

96
00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:26.074
Gentlemen, this is a very big day.

97
00:09:27.304 --> 00:09:31.450
This is it. This is a
very big day, Pascal.

98
00:09:31.451 --> 00:09:34.369
I'm finally going to do it.

99
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.159
- I'm going to ask her.
- RAPUNZEL!

100
00:09:37.588 --> 00:09:39.624
Let down your hair.

101
00:09:40.942 --> 00:09:41.960
It's time.

102
00:09:43.088 --> 00:09:46.502
I know, I know. Come on,
don't let her see you.

103
00:09:48.326 --> 00:09:52.882
Rapunzel, I'm not getting
any younger down here.

104
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.755
Coming, mother.

105
00:10:19.227 --> 00:10:21.945
Hi, welcome home, mother.

106
00:10:21.946 --> 00:10:26.698
Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage
to do that every single day,

107
00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:30.737
without fail, it looks
absolutely exhausting, darling.

108
00:10:30.738 --> 00:10:32.966
Oh, it's nothing.

109
00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:35.012
Then I don't know why it takes so long.

110
00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.021
Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.

111
00:10:40.398 --> 00:10:46.044
All right...so, mother. As you
know tomorrow is a very big day.

112
00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:48.161
Rapunzel look in that
mirror. You know what I see?

113
00:10:48.162 --> 00:10:52.600
I see a strong, confident,
beautiful young lady.

114
00:10:53.224 --> 00:10:55.201
Oh look, you're here too.

115
00:10:56.062 --> 00:10:59.394
I'm just teasing, stop taking
everything so seriously.

116
00:10:59.737 --> 00:11:03.252
Okay, so mother. As I
was saying, tomorrow...

117
00:11:03.253 --> 00:11:05.314
Rapunzel, mother's
feeling a little run down.

118
00:11:05.315 --> 00:11:07.653
Would you sing for me, dear?

119
00:11:07.654 --> 00:11:10.327
- Then we'll talk.
- OH! Of course, mother.

120
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.598
*Flower gleam and glow,
Let your power shine*

121
00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:22.307
*Make the clock reverse,
bring back what once was mine*

122
00:11:22.308 --> 00:11:24.239
*Heal what has been hurt,
Change the fate's design*

123
00:11:24.239 --> 00:11:26.170
*Save what has been lost,
Bring back what once was mine*

124
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.205
- Rapunzel!
- So, mother,

125
00:11:28.206 --> 00:11:31.358
Earlier I was saying that tomorrow was a
pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,

126
00:11:31.359 --> 00:11:33.593
So I'm just going to tell
you. It's my birthday!

127
00:11:33.594 --> 00:11:34.973
TADA!

128
00:11:34.974 --> 00:11:36.121
No, no, no can't be.

129
00:11:36.322 --> 00:11:39.570
I distinctly remember.
Your birthday was last year.

130
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:42.931
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.

131
00:11:44.776 --> 00:11:47.672
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.

132
00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:52.470
And I wanted to ask, what I
really want for this birthday.

133
00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:55.520
Actually what I want for...

134
00:11:55.521 --> 00:11:57.203
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.

135
00:11:57.204 --> 00:11:59.240
You know how I feel about the mumbling.

136
00:11:59.241 --> 00:12:01.338
Blah, blah, blah,...blah.
It's very annoying.

137
00:12:01.339 --> 00:12:03.883
I'm just teasing, you're adorable
I love you so much, darling.

138
00:12:10.277 --> 00:12:12.673
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.

139
00:12:14.394 --> 00:12:16.327
- What?
- Oh,...

140
00:12:16.328 --> 00:12:19.996
Well I was hoping you would take
me to see the floating lights.

141
00:12:19.997 --> 00:12:23.259
Oh, you mean the stars.

142
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.043
That's the thing

143
00:12:25.824 --> 00:12:29.408
I've charted stars and
they're always constant.

144
00:12:29.409 --> 00:12:33.360
But these, they appear every
year on my birthday, Mother.

145
00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:35.397
Only on my birthday.

146
00:12:35.398 --> 00:12:38.184
And I can't help but feel that they're,

147
00:12:38.385 --> 00:12:40.452
They're meant for me.

148
00:12:41.376 --> 00:12:45.182
I need see them, Mother.
And not just from my window.

149
00:12:45.183 --> 00:12:46.682
In person.

150
00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:49.562
I have to know what they are.

151
00:12:49.563 --> 00:12:51.804
You want to go outside?

152
00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:54.035
Oh, why Rapunzel.

153
00:12:54.143 --> 00:12:57.388
Look at you, as fragile as a flower.

154
00:12:57.389 --> 00:13:01.252
*Still a little sapling, just a sprout.*

155
00:13:01.253 --> 00:13:05.627
- *You know why we stay up in this tower*
- I know, but...

156
00:13:05.628 --> 00:13:10.466
*That's right, to keep you safe, and sound, dear.*
*That's right, to keep you safe, and sound, dear.*

157
00:13:10.467 --> 00:13:13.288
*Guess I always knew
this day was coming.*

158
00:13:13.289 --> 00:13:17.230
*Know that soon you'd
want to leave the nest.*

159
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:19.620
- *Soon, but not yet. Shhh..*
- But

160
00:13:19.621 --> 00:13:25.690
*Trust me pet, Mother, knows best.*

161
00:13:27.486 --> 00:13:28.956
*Mother knows best,*

162
00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.729
*listen to your mother.*

163
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.271
*It's a scary world out there.*

164
00:13:33.272 --> 00:13:35.188
*Mother knows best.*

165
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:40.055
*One way or another, something
will go wrong, I swear.*

166
00:13:40.057 --> 00:13:43.077
*Ruffians, thugs,
poison Ivy, quicksand.*

167
00:13:43.078 --> 00:13:45.794
*Cannibals, and snakes,
the plague...yes.*

168
00:13:45.796 --> 00:13:49.321
*Also large bugs, men
with pointy teeth.*

169
00:13:49.322 --> 00:13:53.209
*And stop, no more,
you'll just upset me.*

170
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.875
*Mother's right here,
mother will protect you.*

171
00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:59.517
*Darling here's what I suggest.*

172
00:13:59.518 --> 00:14:02.866
*Skip the drama, stay with Mama.*

173
00:14:02.867 --> 00:14:08.582
*Mother, knows best.*

174
00:14:10.148 --> 00:14:13.572
*Mother knows best. Take
it from your mumsey.*

175
00:14:13.573 --> 00:14:15.849
*On your own, you won't survive.*

176
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.528
*Sloppy underdressed, immature, clumsy,*

177
00:14:19.529 --> 00:14:21.896
*Please, they'll eat you up, alive.*

178
00:14:21.898 --> 00:14:25.771
*Gullible, naive, positively grubby.*
*Gullible, naive, positively grubby.*

179
00:14:25.772 --> 00:14:28.710
*Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm vague.*

180
00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:31.748
*Plus I believe, getting kinda chubby.*

181
00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:35.568
*I'm just saying, 'Cause I wuv you.*

182
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:38.516
*Mother understands,
Mothers here to help you.*

183
00:14:38.517 --> 00:14:43.188
*All I have is one request.*

184
00:14:47.969 --> 00:14:50.877
- Rapunzel?
- Yes?

185
00:14:52.007 --> 00:14:56.112
Don't ever ask to
leave this tower, again.

186
00:14:56.113 --> 00:14:59.150
Yes, Mother.

187
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:03.312
Ahh, I love you very much, dear.

188
00:15:03.313 --> 00:15:05.414
I love you more.

189
00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:08.200
I love you most.

190
00:15:08.835 --> 00:15:11.182
Don't forget it.

191
00:15:11.183 --> 00:15:15.231
*You'll regret it.*

192
00:15:15.232 --> 00:15:17.239
*Motherrrrrrr.*

193
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.659
*Knows best.*

194
00:15:23.492 --> 00:15:27.278
Ta, ta, I'll see you
in a bit, my flower.

195
00:15:28.813 --> 00:15:30.409
I'll be here.

196
00:15:55.248 --> 00:16:00.077
No, no no. This is bad, this is
very, very bad, This is really bad.

197
00:16:01.515 --> 00:16:03.552
They just can't get my nose right.

198
00:16:03.553 --> 00:16:05.230
Who cares.

199
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.772
Well it's easy for you to say.

200
00:16:06.773 --> 00:16:08.885
You guys look amazing.

201
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:27.076
All right, okay. Give me a
boost, and I'll pull you up.

202
00:16:27.909 --> 00:16:29.901
Give us the satchel first.

203
00:16:29.902 --> 00:16:32.485
Wha..? I just...

204
00:16:32.486 --> 00:16:34.325
I can't believe, that after
all we've been through together,

205
00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:36.782
you don't trust me.

206
00:16:38.785 --> 00:16:39.976
Ouch.

207
00:16:47.826 --> 00:16:49.735
Now help us up, pretty boy.

208
00:16:49.736 --> 00:16:52.648
Sorry, my hands are full.

209
00:16:53.459 --> 00:16:54.774
What?

210
00:16:55.474 --> 00:16:57.647
RYDER!

211
00:17:03.508 --> 00:17:06.098
- Retrieve that satchel with any force.
- Yes, sir!

212
00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:24.985
We got him now, Maximus.

213
00:17:38.542 --> 00:17:41.026
Heeyah! Come flea
- bag, forward.

214
00:17:43.407 --> 00:17:44.434
No.

215
00:17:44.436 --> 00:17:45.944
No, stop it.

216
00:17:45.945 --> 00:17:47.115
Stop it.

217
00:17:47.493 --> 00:17:48.691
Give it to me.

218
00:19:32.395 --> 00:19:34.480
Alone at last.

219
00:21:10.112 --> 00:21:13.260
Okay, okay, I got a person in my closet.

220
00:21:13.261 --> 00:21:16.436
I've got a person in my closet.

221
00:21:16.979 --> 00:21:20.911
I've got a person in my closet!

222
00:21:23.535 --> 00:21:26.194
To weak to handle myself
out there, huh Mother?

223
00:21:26.195 --> 00:21:30.657
Well, Tell that to my frying pan.

224
00:22:10.948 --> 00:22:12.131
Rapunzel!

225
00:22:14.108 --> 00:22:16.042
Let down your hair.

226
00:22:16.695 --> 00:22:17.713
One moment, Mother.

227
00:22:17.714 --> 00:22:19.903
I have a big surprise.

228
00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:22.177
Uh, I do too.

229
00:22:22.178 --> 00:22:24.859
Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.

230
00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.327
I seriously doubt it.

231
00:22:29.217 --> 00:22:33.263
I brought back parsnips. I'm going to make
hazel nut soup for dinner, your favorite.

232
00:22:33.264 --> 00:22:34.484
Surprise!

233
00:22:34.485 --> 00:22:37.173
Well mother, there's
something I want to tell you.

234
00:22:37.173 --> 00:22:39.858
Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate
leaving you after a fight.

235
00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:42.524
Especially when I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

236
00:22:42.525 --> 00:22:45.319
Okay, I've been thinking a lot
about what you said, earlier.

237
00:22:46.347 --> 00:22:48.706
I hope you're not still
talking about the stars.

238
00:22:48.707 --> 00:22:51.335
Floating lights, and yes
I'm leading up to that.

239
00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:53.639
Because I really thought we
dropped the issue, sweetheart.

240
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.617
No Mother, I'm just saying,

241
00:22:55.618 --> 00:22:58.496
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.

242
00:22:58.497 --> 00:23:01.969
Oh darling, I know you're not strong
enough to handle yourself out there.

243
00:23:01.971 --> 00:23:05.229
- But if you just...
- Rapunzel, we're done talking about this.

244
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.489
- Trust me,...
- Rapunzel.

245
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:07.878
- ...I know what I'm
- Rapunzel.

246
00:23:07.879 --> 00:23:10.074
- Oh, come on.
- Enough with the lights, Rapunzel.

247
00:23:10.085 --> 00:23:14.616
You are not leaving this tower, EVER!

248
00:23:20.233 --> 00:23:24.094
Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.

249
00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:40.044
All I was gonna say, mother is that...

250
00:23:40.045 --> 00:23:43.348
I know what I want for my birthday, now.

251
00:23:43.349 --> 00:23:45.093
And what is that?

252
00:23:45.644 --> 00:23:51.460
New paint. That paint made from the
white shells you once brought me.

253
00:23:51.461 --> 00:23:54.577
Well that is a very long trip, Rapunzel.

254
00:23:54.578 --> 00:23:56.460
Almost three day's time.

255
00:23:56.682 --> 00:24:01.518
I just thought it was a
better idea than, uh, stars.

256
00:24:06.101 --> 00:24:08.377
You sure you'll be
all right, on your own?

257
00:24:08.379 --> 00:24:11.729
I know I'm safe, as long as I'm here.

258
00:24:19.878 --> 00:24:22.424
I'll be back in three days time.

259
00:24:22.426 --> 00:24:25.733
I love you very much, dear.

260
00:24:25.741 --> 00:24:27.689
I love you more.

261
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:31.235
I love you most.

262
00:24:51.671 --> 00:24:52.901
Okay.

263
00:25:37.918 --> 00:25:41.454
Is this...hair?

264
00:25:41.455 --> 00:25:45.071
Struggling...struggling is pointless.

265
00:25:48.233 --> 00:25:50.224
I know why you're here.

266
00:25:50.225 --> 00:25:52.948
And I'm not afraid of you.

267
00:25:53.239 --> 00:25:54.461
What?

268
00:26:03.486 --> 00:26:07.035
Who are you, and how did you find me?

269
00:26:10.881 --> 00:26:14.553
Who are you, and how did you find me?

270
00:26:17.501 --> 00:26:19.353
I know not who you are.

271
00:26:19.354 --> 00:26:21.518
Nor how I came to find you.

272
00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:23.459
But may I just say.

273
00:26:24.826 --> 00:26:26.697
Hi!

274
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.343
How you doing?

275
00:26:30.344 --> 00:26:31.849
The name's Flynn Ryder.

276
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.728
How's your day going, huh?

277
00:26:35.924 --> 00:26:40.619
Who else knows my location, Flynn Ryder?

278
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.167
- All right, Blondie.
- Rapunzel.

279
00:26:42.655 --> 00:26:44.315
Gesundheit, here's the deal.

280
00:26:44.316 --> 00:26:47.109
I was in a situation,
Gallivanting through the forest.

281
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:49.261
I came across your tower and...

282
00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:52.624
Ho, oh no, where is my satchel?

283
00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:56.166
I've hidden it, somewhere
you'll never find it.

284
00:26:58.967 --> 00:27:00.750
It's in that pot, isn't it.

285
00:27:05.252 --> 00:27:06.373
Huh?

286
00:27:06.623 --> 00:27:09.677
Ahh, will you stop that.

287
00:27:09.678 --> 00:27:12.408
Now it's hidden where
you'll never find it.

288
00:27:13.622 --> 00:27:16.733
So, what do you want, with my hair?

289
00:27:16.733 --> 00:27:17.971
- To cut it?
- What?

290
00:27:17.972 --> 00:27:19.631
- Sell it?
- No!

291
00:27:19.632 --> 00:27:22.550
Listen, the only thing I
want to do with your hair,

292
00:27:22.551 --> 00:27:25.330
is to get out of it. Literally.

293
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:28.806
Wait, you don't want my hair?

294
00:27:28.807 --> 00:27:30.783
Why on earth would I want your hair?

295
00:27:30.784 --> 00:27:34.269
Look, I was being chased, I saw a
tower, I climbed it, end of story.

296
00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.285
You're, telling the truth?

297
00:27:36.287 --> 00:27:37.739
Yes.

298
00:27:49.775 --> 00:27:52.320
I know, I need someone to take me.

299
00:27:52.347 --> 00:27:54.708
I think he's telling the truth, too.

300
00:27:54.709 --> 00:27:58.591
Doesn't have fangs, but
what choice do I have?

301
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:04.777
Uh, okay Flynn Ryder, I'm
prepared to offer you a deal.

302
00:28:04.778 --> 00:28:06.446
- Deal?
- Look this way.

303
00:28:08.028 --> 00:28:10.599
Do you know what these are?

304
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.901
You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

305
00:28:13.902 --> 00:28:15.779
Lanterns...

306
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.920
I knew they weren't stars.

307
00:28:18.727 --> 00:28:23.402
Well, tomorrow evening they
will light the night sky,

308
00:28:23.403 --> 00:28:27.441
with these lanterns.
You will act as my guide,

309
00:28:27.442 --> 00:28:31.052
Take me to these lanterns,
and return me home safely.

310
00:28:31.053 --> 00:28:35.331
Then, and only then, will I
return your satchel to you.

311
00:28:35.332 --> 00:28:36.529
That is my deal.

312
00:28:36.672 --> 00:28:40.235
Yeah, no can do.

313
00:28:40.236 --> 00:28:44.081
Unfortunately, the kingdom and
I aren't exactly, simpatico,

314
00:28:44.082 --> 00:28:46.373
at the moment. So I won't
be taking you anywhere.

315
00:28:53.493 --> 00:28:56.581
Something brought you here, Flynn Ryder.

316
00:28:56.582 --> 00:29:00.778
- Call it what you will, fate, destiny.
- A horse.

317
00:29:00.779 --> 00:29:03.382
So I have made the
decision to trust you.

318
00:29:03.383 --> 00:29:04.711
A horrible decision, really.

319
00:29:04.712 --> 00:29:07.087
But trust me, when I tell you this.

320
00:29:09.491 --> 00:29:13.192
You can tear this tower
apart, brick by brick.

321
00:29:13.193 --> 00:29:17.605
But without my help, you will
never find your precious satchel.

322
00:29:17.606 --> 00:29:20.578
Let me just get this straight.

323
00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.466
I take you to see the lanterns.

324
00:29:22.467 --> 00:29:23.766
Bring you back home,

325
00:29:23.767 --> 00:29:25.937
and you'll give me back my satchel?

326
00:29:25.939 --> 00:29:27.195
I promise.

327
00:29:28.998 --> 00:29:33.971
And when I promise something,
I never ever break that promise.

328
00:29:36.413 --> 00:29:37.812
EVER!

329
00:29:40.892 --> 00:29:43.639
All right, listen, I didn't
want to have to want to do this,

330
00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.231
but you leave me no choice.

331
00:29:45.865 --> 00:29:47.646
Here comes the 'smolder'.

332
00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.200
This is kind of an off day for me.

333
00:29:57.201 --> 00:29:58.988
This doesn't normally happen.

334
00:29:58.998 --> 00:30:01.576
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.

335
00:30:01.578 --> 00:30:03.077
Really!

336
00:30:03.873 --> 00:30:06.489
- Ooops.
- You broke my 'smolder'.

337
00:30:11.302 --> 00:30:13.293
You coming, Blondie?

338
00:30:23.792 --> 00:30:27.505
*Look at the world so close,
and I'm half way to it*

339
00:30:28.793 --> 00:30:32.757
*Look at it all, so big do I even dare?*

340
00:30:33.336 --> 00:30:37.687
*Look at me, here at last
I just have to do it.*

341
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.711
Should I? No.

342
00:30:41.203 --> 00:30:42.476
Here I go.

343
00:31:13.011 --> 00:31:19.000
*Just smell the grass, the dirt.
Just like I dreamed they'd be.*

344
00:31:20.418 --> 00:31:22.214
*Just feel that summer breeze.*

345
00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:25.420
*The way it's calling me.*

346
00:31:26.811 --> 00:31:33.400
*For like the first time
ever, I'm completely free.*

347
00:31:34.339 --> 00:31:39.330
*I could go running, and
racing, and dancing...

348
00:31:39.331 --> 00:31:42.209
*and chasing, and leaping and bounding.*

349
00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.813
*Hair flying, heart pounding
and splashing and reeling.*

350
00:31:45.814 --> 00:31:48.867
*And finally feeling,*

351
00:31:48.868 --> 00:31:58.868
*That's when my life begins.*

352
00:32:02.771 --> 00:32:06.257
I can't believe I did this.

353
00:32:06.648 --> 00:32:11.284
I can't believe I did this.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!

354
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:14.540
Mother would be so furious.

355
00:32:15.084 --> 00:32:18.534
That's okay, what she doesn't know won't kill her, right?
That's okay, what she doesn't know won't kill her, right?

356
00:32:18.539 --> 00:32:21.344
Oh my gosh, this would kill her.

357
00:32:21.345 --> 00:32:24.683
THIS IS SO FUN!

358
00:32:24.684 --> 00:32:28.327
I am a horrible
daughter, I'm going back.

359
00:32:28.328 --> 00:32:30.978
I am never going baaaccckkk!

360
00:32:30.979 --> 00:32:34.970
I am a despicable human being.

361
00:32:37.031 --> 00:32:39.637
Best day, ever!

362
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.264
You know, I can't help but notice,

363
00:32:51.265 --> 00:32:54.553
you seem a little at
war with yourself, here.

364
00:32:55.042 --> 00:32:58.005
- What?
- Now, I'm only picking up bits and pieces,

365
00:32:58.006 --> 00:33:00.417
of course, over protective
mother, forbidden road trip.

366
00:33:00.418 --> 00:33:02.002
I mean, this is serious stuff.

367
00:33:02.003 --> 00:33:03.917
But let me ease your conscious.

368
00:33:03.918 --> 00:33:05.649
This is part of growing up.

369
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.768
A little rebellion, a little adventure.

370
00:33:07.769 --> 00:33:09.706
That's good, healthy even.

371
00:33:10.978 --> 00:33:12.702
You think?

372
00:33:12.703 --> 00:33:15.681
I know. You're way over
thinking this, trust me.

373
00:33:15.682 --> 00:33:17.847
Does your mother deserve it? No.

374
00:33:17.848 --> 00:33:20.348
Will this break her
heart and crush her soul?

375
00:33:20.349 --> 00:33:23.350
Of course. But you just got to do it.

376
00:33:24.246 --> 00:33:25.756
Break her heart?

377
00:33:25.757 --> 00:33:28.954
- In half.
- Crush her soul?

378
00:33:28.956 --> 00:33:30.853
Like a grape.

379
00:33:30.854 --> 00:33:33.645
She would be heart broken, you're right.

380
00:33:33.853 --> 00:33:37.556
I am, oh my, oh bother.

381
00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:41.155
All right, I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

382
00:33:41.156 --> 00:33:42.802
I'm letting you out of the deal.

383
00:33:42.803 --> 00:33:44.630
- What?
- That's right.

384
00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:47.224
But don't thank me.
Let's just turn around,

385
00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:48.976
and get you home, here's
your pan and your frog.

386
00:33:48.977 --> 00:33:50.732
I get back my satchel.

387
00:33:50.733 --> 00:33:52.836
You get back a mother
daughter relationship

388
00:33:52.837 --> 00:33:56.982
based on mutual trust and viola!
We part ways as unlikely friends.

389
00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:01.487
- No, I am seeing those lanterns.
- Oh, come on!

390
00:34:01.488 --> 00:34:03.365
What is it going to take
to get my satchel back?

391
00:34:03.914 --> 00:34:05.441
I will use this.

392
00:34:08.709 --> 00:34:11.848
Is it, ruffians, thugs?
Have they come for me?

393
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.778
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.

394
00:34:18.779 --> 00:34:21.475
Oh, sorry.

395
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.534
Guess I'm just a little bit, jumpy.

396
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:29.470
Probably be best if we avoid
ruffians and thugs, though.

397
00:34:29.603 --> 00:34:32.924
Yeah, that probably be best.

398
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:36.907
Are you hungry? I know
a great place for lunch.

399
00:34:37.727 --> 00:34:40.253
- Where?
- Oh, don't you worry.

400
00:34:40.254 --> 00:34:41.772
You'll know it when you smell it.

401
00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:21.866
Oh, a Palace horse.

402
00:35:21.867 --> 00:35:24.055
Where's your rider?

403
00:35:25.097 --> 00:35:26.140
Rapunzel.

404
00:35:27.273 --> 00:35:28.495
RAPUNZEL!

405
00:35:36.515 --> 00:35:40.047
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

406
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:43.508
Rapunzel?

407
00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:04.008
Rapunzel!

408
00:36:07.073 --> 00:36:08.760
RAPUNZEL!

409
00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:56.429
I know it's around here, somewhere.

410
00:36:57.188 --> 00:36:59.106
Ah, there it is.

411
00:36:59.107 --> 00:37:01.028
The Snuggly duckling.

412
00:37:01.029 --> 00:37:03.779
Don't worry, very quaint
place, perfect for you.

413
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.184
Don't want you scaring, and giving
up on this whole endeavor now do we?

414
00:37:07.185 --> 00:37:10.586
- Well, I do like duckling.
- YAY!

415
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:14.860
Garcon, your finest table, please.

416
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.594
You smell that? Take a deep
breath through the nose.

417
00:37:25.306 --> 00:37:26.528
Really let that seep in.

418
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.543
What are you getting? Because
to me, it's part man smell.

419
00:37:29.544 --> 00:37:31.426
and the other part is
really bad man smell.

420
00:37:31.427 --> 00:37:33.862
I don't know why, but overall, it
just smells like the color brown.

421
00:37:33.863 --> 00:37:34.880
Your thoughts?

422
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.554
That's a lot of hair.

423
00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:40.511
She's growing it out, is
that blood on your moustache?

424
00:37:40.512 --> 00:37:43.107
Goldie, look at this, look at
all the blood on his moustache.

425
00:37:43.108 --> 00:37:45.568
Look sir, that's a lot of blood.

426
00:37:46.551 --> 00:37:48.428
Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.

427
00:37:48.429 --> 00:37:50.804
Maybe we should get
you home. Call it a day.

428
00:37:50.804 --> 00:37:54.013
Probably be better off. This
is a five star joint after all.

429
00:37:54.014 --> 00:37:57.481
And if you can't handle this place, well
maybe you should be back in your tower.

430
00:37:57.483 --> 00:38:00.172
Is this you?

431
00:38:02.375 --> 00:38:05.165
No, no this is being mean.

432
00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:06.417
Oh, it's him all right.

433
00:38:06.418 --> 00:38:08.626
Gretel, go find some guards.

434
00:38:08.627 --> 00:38:12.800
That reward's going
to buy me a new hook.

435
00:38:12.801 --> 00:38:14.244
I can use the money.

436
00:38:14.245 --> 00:38:16.274
What about me? I'm broke.

437
00:38:17.162 --> 00:38:20.198
- Boys, stop!
- We can work this out.

438
00:38:20.199 --> 00:38:22.298
Hey, leave him alone.

439
00:38:22.302 --> 00:38:26.699
- Gentlemen, please.
- Give me back my guide, ruffians.

440
00:38:34.573 --> 00:38:36.398
Not the nose, not the
nose, not the nose!

441
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:40.378
Put him down!

442
00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:48.098
Okay, I don't know where I am, and I
need him to take me to see the lanterns,

443
00:38:48.099 --> 00:38:50.415
because I've been dreaming
about them my entire life.

444
00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:53.117
Find your humanity.

445
00:38:53.118 --> 00:38:55.220
Haven't any of you ever had a dream?

446
00:39:07.384 --> 00:39:09.625
I, had a dream.

447
00:39:09.626 --> 00:39:10.722
Once.

448
00:39:19.509 --> 00:39:21.887
*I'm malicious mean and scary.*

449
00:39:21.888 --> 00:39:23.956
*My sneer could curdle dairy.*

450
00:39:23.957 --> 00:39:27.259
*And violence
- wise my hands are not the cleanest.*

451
00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:31.900
*But despite my evil look,
and my temper and my hook.*

452
00:39:32.229 --> 00:39:35.409
*I've always yearned to
be a concert pianist.*

453
00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:39.160
*Can't cha see me on the
stage performing Mozart.*

454
00:39:39.163 --> 00:39:42.793
*Tickling the ivories, 'til they gleam.*

455
00:39:42.794 --> 00:39:45.061
*Yep, I'd rather be called deadly.*

456
00:39:45.062 --> 00:39:48.063
*For my killer show
- tune medley. Thank you.*

457
00:39:48.064 --> 00:39:51.800
*'Cause way down deep
inside I've got a dream.*

458
00:39:51.801 --> 00:39:55.143
*He's got a dream, he's got a dream.*

459
00:39:55.144 --> 00:39:58.650
*See, I ain't as cruel
and vicious as I seem.*

460
00:39:58.652 --> 00:40:01.284
*Though I feel like breaking femurs.*

461
00:40:01.285 --> 00:40:03.371
*You can count me with the dreamers.*

462
00:40:03.372 --> 00:40:06.011
*Like everybody else, I've gotta dream.*

463
00:40:11.675 --> 00:40:13.570
*I've got scars and lumps and bruises.*

464
00:40:13.571 --> 00:40:15.785
*Plus something here that oozes.*

465
00:40:15.786 --> 00:40:18.463
*Let's not even mention my complexion.*

466
00:40:18.464 --> 00:40:20.615
*But despite my extra toes.*

467
00:40:20.616 --> 00:40:22.521
*And my goiter and my nose.*

468
00:40:22.522 --> 00:40:25.624
*I really want to make
a love connection.*

469
00:40:25.625 --> 00:40:29.653
*Can't you see me with
a special little lady.*

470
00:40:29.654 --> 00:40:32.916
*Rowing in a row boat, down the stream.*

471
00:40:32.917 --> 00:40:34.956
*Though I'm one disgusting blighter.*

472
00:40:34.957 --> 00:40:36.993
*I'm a lover, not a fighter.*

473
00:40:36.994 --> 00:40:40.047
*'Cause way down deep
inside, I gotta dream.*

474
00:40:40.048 --> 00:40:43.714
*I gotta dream, I gotta dream.*

475
00:40:43.715 --> 00:40:47.191
*And I know one day will
never reign supreme.*

476
00:40:47.192 --> 00:40:49.379
*Though my face leaves
people screaming.*

477
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.489
*There's a child behind it dreaming.*

478
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.201
*Like everybody else, I've gotta dream.*

479
00:40:54.202 --> 00:40:57.778
*Tor would like to
quit and be a florist.*

480
00:40:57.779 --> 00:41:01.780
*Gunther does interior design.*

481
00:41:01.782 --> 00:41:05.692
*Ulf is into mime, Attila's cupcakes are sublime.*
*Ulf is into mime, Attila's cupcakes are sublime.*

482
00:41:05.693 --> 00:41:07.517
*Bruiser knits, Killer sews.*

483
00:41:07.518 --> 00:41:09.492
*Fang does little puppet shows.*

484
00:41:09.493 --> 00:41:15.020
*And Vladimir collects
ceramic unicorns.*

485
00:41:15.021 --> 00:41:17.554
What about you?

486
00:41:17.556 --> 00:41:19.889
- I'm sorry, me?
- What's your dream?

487
00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:23.254
No, no, no. Sorry boys, I don't sing.

488
00:41:24.416 --> 00:41:26.287
*I have dreams like you, no really.*

489
00:41:26.288 --> 00:41:27.874
*Just much less, touchy
- feely.*

490
00:41:27.875 --> 00:41:30.786
*They mainly happen
somewhere warm and sunny.*

491
00:41:30.787 --> 00:41:34.928
*On an island that I own,
tanned and rested and alone.*

492
00:41:35.648 --> 00:41:38.828
*Surrounded by enormous piles of money.*

493
00:41:39.115 --> 00:41:42.527
*- I've got a dream...I've got
a dream. - She's got a dream.*

494
00:41:42.528 --> 00:41:46.042
*I just want to see the
floating lanterns gleam.*

495
00:41:46.043 --> 00:41:48.476
*And with every passing hour.*

496
00:41:48.477 --> 00:41:50.153
*I'm so glad I left my tower.*

497
00:41:50.154 --> 00:41:53.048
*Like all you lovely
folks, I've got a dream.*

498
00:41:53.049 --> 00:41:57.132
*She's gotta dream, He's gotta dream.
They've gotta dream, we've gotta dream.*

499
00:41:57.133 --> 00:42:05.139
*So our differences ain't really
that extreme. We're one big team.*

500
00:42:05.141 --> 00:42:09.001
*Call us brutal, say sadistic
and grotesquely optimistic.

501
00:42:09.003 --> 00:42:11.935
*'Cause way down deep
inside, we've gotta dream.*

502
00:42:11.936 --> 00:42:14.249
*We gotta dream, I gotta dream.*

503
00:42:17.588 --> 00:42:21.568
*Yes way down deep inside I've got a...*

504
00:42:21.569 --> 00:42:27.627
*Dreeeeeeaaaaamm.*

505
00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.271
I found the guards.

506
00:42:35.806 --> 00:42:37.341
Where's Ryder, where is he?

507
00:42:37.342 --> 00:42:39.499
I know he's in here somewhere.

508
00:42:39.501 --> 00:42:42.614
Find him, turn the place
upside down if you have to!

509
00:42:58.613 --> 00:43:01.407
Go, live your dream.

510
00:43:01.408 --> 00:43:02.752
I will.

511
00:43:02.753 --> 00:43:05.296
Your dream stinks, I was talking to her.

512
00:43:07.496 --> 00:43:08.981
Thanks for everything.

513
00:43:12.758 --> 00:43:15.709
I believe this is the
man you're looking for.

514
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.527
You got me.

515
00:43:18.369 --> 00:43:19.997
Sir, there's no sign of Ryder.

516
00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:25.523
Maximus.

517
00:43:32.865 --> 00:43:34.389
What's he doing?

518
00:43:44.155 --> 00:43:47.171
A passage, come on men, let's go.

519
00:43:47.514 --> 00:43:50.224
Corman, make sure those
boys don't get away.

520
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:56.163
Play it safe.

521
00:43:58.461 --> 00:43:59.886
We'll go get the crown.

522
00:44:07.677 --> 00:44:11.472
I gotta dream, I got some dream.

523
00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:16.441
I..., ohhh, somebody get me a glass.

524
00:44:16.442 --> 00:44:20.672
Because I just found me
a tall drink of water.

525
00:44:20.673 --> 00:44:24.760
Oh stop it, you big lug.

526
00:44:24.761 --> 00:44:27.239
Where does that tunnel lead out?

527
00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.316
Knife!

528
00:44:30.735 --> 00:44:32.214
Well, that got us safe.

529
00:44:32.215 --> 00:44:35.554
Didn't know you had that in you back
there. That was pretty, impressive.

530
00:44:35.555 --> 00:44:37.897
I KNOW!

531
00:44:37.898 --> 00:44:40.673
I know...

532
00:44:43.155 --> 00:44:45.917
Sooo, Flynn.

533
00:44:45.918 --> 00:44:47.118
Where are you from?

534
00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:49.304
Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie,
I don't do back story.

535
00:44:49.305 --> 00:44:52.201
However I am becoming
very interested in yours.

536
00:44:52.202 --> 00:44:54.677
Now I...I know I'm not
suppose to mention the hair.

537
00:44:54.678 --> 00:44:56.491
- Nope.
- Or, the Mother.

538
00:44:56.492 --> 00:44:59.335
- Uh, uh.
- Frankly I'm to scared to ask about the frog.

539
00:44:59.336 --> 00:45:00.692
- Chameleon.
- Nuance.

540
00:45:00.693 --> 00:45:04.646
Here's my question though, if you
want to see the lanterns so badly,

541
00:45:04.647 --> 00:45:07.004
why haven't you gone before?

542
00:45:15.065 --> 00:45:17.377
Uh, Flynn...

543
00:45:18.011 --> 00:45:19.265
Flynn!

544
00:45:21.595 --> 00:45:23.222
Run, RUN!

545
00:45:41.566 --> 00:45:42.761
Who's that?

546
00:45:42.762 --> 00:45:43.965
They don't like me.

547
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:46.394
- Who's that?
- They don't like me either.

548
00:45:47.113 --> 00:45:49.697
- Who's that?
- Lets just assume for the moment,

549
00:45:49.697 --> 00:45:51.214
that everyone here doesn't like me.

550
00:45:51.224 --> 00:45:52.714
Here.

551
00:46:01.855 --> 00:46:03.983
I've waited a long time for this.

552
00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:16.833
Oh mama, I have got
to get me one of these.

553
00:46:25.036 --> 00:46:29.797
You should know that this is the
strangest thing I've ever done.

554
00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:36.233
How 'bout two out of three?

555
00:46:37.367 --> 00:46:38.616
Flynn!

556
00:46:42.777 --> 00:46:45.017
Flynn, look out.

557
00:46:45.045 --> 00:46:47.355
- Whoa, WHOAAA!
- Hold on.

558
00:46:50.295 --> 00:46:52.901
You should see your
faces. Because you look...

559
00:46:53.369 --> 00:46:54.590
Ridiculous

560
00:47:01.931 --> 00:47:03.162
Come on, Blondie.

561
00:47:03.336 --> 00:47:04.456
Jump.

562
00:48:33.284 --> 00:48:37.042
It's no use, I can't see anything.

563
00:48:41.907 --> 00:48:43.757
Hey, there's no point.

564
00:48:43.758 --> 00:48:45.601
It's pitch black down there.

565
00:48:53.721 --> 00:48:54.830
This is all my fault.

566
00:48:56.911 --> 00:48:59.617
She was right, I never
should have done this.

567
00:49:04.089 --> 00:49:05.427
I'm so...

568
00:49:06.311 --> 00:49:08.718
I'm so sorry, Flynn.

569
00:49:16.026 --> 00:49:17.936
Eugene.

570
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.259
What?

571
00:49:20.671 --> 00:49:23.090
My real name is, Eugene Fitzherbert.

572
00:49:24.862 --> 00:49:26.665
So you might as well know.

573
00:49:29.578 --> 00:49:33.122
I have magic hair
that glows when I sing.

574
00:49:33.123 --> 00:49:34.183
What?

575
00:49:36.369 --> 00:49:40.486
I have magic hair,
that glows when I sing.

576
00:49:41.563 --> 00:49:44.839
*Flower gleam and glow.
Let your power shine.*

577
00:50:34.441 --> 00:50:36.003
We made it.

578
00:50:36.597 --> 00:50:37.867
Her hair glows.

579
00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:40.592
We're alive. I'm alive!

580
00:50:40.593 --> 00:50:43.424
I didn't see that coming.
You're hair actually glows.

581
00:50:43.425 --> 00:50:45.314
- Eugene...
- Why does her hair glow?

582
00:50:45.315 --> 00:50:46.633
- Eugene!
- What?

583
00:50:47.773 --> 00:50:50.464
It doesn't just glow.

584
00:50:52.892 --> 00:50:54.524
Why is he smiling at me?

585
00:51:18.997 --> 00:51:20.219
I'll kill him.

586
00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.948
I'll kill that, Ryder.

587
00:51:23.322 --> 00:51:25.441
We'll cut him off at the kingdom.

588
00:51:25.442 --> 00:51:27.669
And get back the crown, come on.

589
00:51:29.128 --> 00:51:30.258
Boys.

590
00:51:31.553 --> 00:51:36.340
Perhaps you want to stop acting
like wild dogs chasing their tails,

591
00:51:36.341 --> 00:51:38.447
and think for a moment.

592
00:51:40.518 --> 00:51:42.848
Oh, please there's no need for that.

593
00:51:48.301 --> 00:51:52.130
Well if that's all you
desire, then be on your way.

594
00:51:52.131 --> 00:51:55.062
I was going to offer you something
worth one thousand crowns,

595
00:51:55.063 --> 00:51:57.075
would have made you rich beyond belief.

596
00:51:57.076 --> 00:51:59.073
And that wasn't even the best part.

597
00:51:59.074 --> 00:52:00.660
Oh well, C'est la vie.

598
00:52:00.661 --> 00:52:02.914
Enjoy  your crown.

599
00:52:04.611 --> 00:52:06.155
What's the best part?

600
00:52:06.619 --> 00:52:11.508
It comes with revenge on Flynn Ryder.

601
00:52:18.127 --> 00:52:22.875
So you're being strangely cryptic as  you
wrap your magic hair around my injured hand.

602
00:52:23.863 --> 00:52:25.279
Sorry.

603
00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.851
Just don't, don't freak out.

604
00:52:36.092 --> 00:52:39.920
*Flower gleam and glow*

605
00:52:39.921 --> 00:52:44.340
*Let your powers shine*

606
00:52:44.341 --> 00:52:48.339
*Make the clock reverse*

607
00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:51.993
*Bring back what once was mine.*

608
00:52:51.994 --> 00:52:57.036
*Heal what has been hurt.*

609
00:52:57.037 --> 00:53:01.311
*Change the fates design.*

610
00:53:01.312 --> 00:53:05.519
*Save what has been lost.*

611
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.613
*Bring back what once was mine.*

612
00:53:08.614 --> 00:53:14.460
*What once was mine.*

613
00:53:28.247 --> 00:53:29.708
- Ah...
- Please don't freak out.

614
00:53:33.906 --> 00:53:36.110
Ahhh. I'm not freaking
out, are you freaking out?

615
00:53:36.111 --> 00:53:39.574
No, I'm just very interested in your hair.
and the magical qualities that it possesses.

616
00:53:39.575 --> 00:53:41.373
How long has it been
doing that, exactly?

617
00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:45.165
Forever, I guess.

618
00:53:46.443 --> 00:53:49.699
Mother said when I was a
baby people tried to cut it.

619
00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:52.094
They wanted to take it for themselves.

620
00:53:52.104 --> 00:53:54.401
But, once it's cut.

621
00:53:54.402 --> 00:53:57.090
It turns brown, and looses its power.

622
00:53:57.784 --> 00:54:01.427
A gift like that, it
has to be protected.

623
00:54:01.965 --> 00:54:04.670
That's why Mother never let me...

624
00:54:08.044 --> 00:54:12.617
That's why...I never left the...

625
00:54:14.324 --> 00:54:16.518
You never left that tower.

626
00:54:20.218 --> 00:54:22.535
And you're still gonna go back?

627
00:54:22.837 --> 00:54:25.276
No...yes.

628
00:54:27.013 --> 00:54:29.023
It's complicated.

629
00:54:39.853 --> 00:54:42.908
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

630
00:54:42.909 --> 00:54:46.662
Ah yeah, well. I'll
spare you the sob story of

631
00:54:46.663 --> 00:54:49.750
poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert,
it's a little bit of a...

632
00:54:49.751 --> 00:54:51.463
It's a little bit of a downer.

633
00:54:57.736 --> 00:54:59.331
There was this book.

634
00:54:59.332 --> 00:55:01.932
A book I used to read every
night to all the younger kids.

635
00:55:01.933 --> 00:55:03.750
The tales of Flynnigan Ryder.

636
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:06.550
Swashbuckling rogue, richest man alive.

637
00:55:06.551 --> 00:55:10.533
Not bad with the ladies either.
Nothing to ever brag about, of course.

638
00:55:11.449 --> 00:55:13.051
Was he a thief too?

639
00:55:13.052 --> 00:55:16.689
Ahh, well no.

640
00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:20.235
Actually, he had enough money to
do anything that he wanted to do.

641
00:55:20.236 --> 00:55:21.968
He could go anywhere
that he wanted to go.

642
00:55:21.984 --> 00:55:25.158
And...and, for a kid, with nothing.

643
00:55:25.159 --> 00:55:27.172
I don't know, I...

644
00:55:28.183 --> 00:55:29.655
It just seemed like a better option.

645
00:55:30.435 --> 00:55:33.151
You can't tell anyone, about this, okay?

646
00:55:33.153 --> 00:55:35.717
It could ruin my whole reputation.

647
00:55:35.996 --> 00:55:38.624
Ahh, we wouldn't want that.

648
00:55:38.625 --> 00:55:41.396
Oh, the thing about a reputation,
it's all that a man has.

649
00:55:48.703 --> 00:55:51.716
Um, well I should uh...

650
00:55:52.396 --> 00:55:55.162
I, I should get some more firewood.

651
00:55:57.894 --> 00:56:03.195
For the record, I like Eugene
Fitzherbert much better than, Flynn Ryder.

652
00:56:05.096 --> 00:56:07.984
Well, then you'd be the first.

653
00:56:08.647 --> 00:56:09.969
But, thank you.

654
00:56:18.822 --> 00:56:22.113
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

655
00:56:22.114 --> 00:56:23.412
Mother?

656
00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:25.417
Hello, dear.

657
00:56:25.418 --> 00:56:27.533
But I...I..., don't we...

658
00:56:27.747 --> 00:56:29.555
How did you find me?

659
00:56:29.556 --> 00:56:31.491
Oh, it was easy really.

660
00:56:31.492 --> 00:56:35.971
I just listened for the sound of complete
and utter betrayal, and followed that.

661
00:56:38.352 --> 00:56:40.553
- Mother...
- We're going home, Rapunzel.

662
00:56:40.554 --> 00:56:42.980
- Now.
- You...You don't understand.

663
00:56:42.981 --> 00:56:44.816
I've been on this incredible journey.

664
00:56:44.817 --> 00:56:47.027
And I've seen and learned so much.

665
00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:49.821
I even met someone.

666
00:56:49.822 --> 00:56:52.163
Yes, the wanted thief. I'm so proud.

667
00:56:52.164 --> 00:56:54.281
- Come on, Rapunzel.
- Mother, wait.

668
00:56:54.594 --> 00:56:55.821
I think

669
00:56:57.161 --> 00:56:59.305
I think he likes me.

670
00:56:59.306 --> 00:57:01.924
Likes you? Please,
Rapunzel, that's demented.

671
00:57:01.925 --> 00:57:04.965
- But mother, I...
- This is why you never should have left.

672
00:57:06.079 --> 00:57:09.171
Dear this whole romance
that you've invented,

673
00:57:09.172 --> 00:57:13.945
just proves you're to naive to be here.

674
00:57:13.945 --> 00:57:17.223
Why would he like you?
Oh come on now, really.

675
00:57:17.782 --> 00:57:20.508
Look at you, you think
that he's impressed?

676
00:57:21.356 --> 00:57:24.860
Don't be a dummy, come with mommy.

677
00:57:25.824 --> 00:57:26.920
*Mother...*

678
00:57:26.921 --> 00:57:30.364
- NO!
- No?

679
00:57:33.226 --> 00:57:35.248
I see how it is.

680
00:57:37.753 --> 00:57:39.853
*Rapunzel, knows best.*

681
00:57:39.854 --> 00:57:41.688
*Rapunzel's so mature, now.*

682
00:57:41.689 --> 00:57:44.330
*Such a clever grown up, miss.*

683
00:57:44.331 --> 00:57:46.822
*Rapunzel knows best.*

684
00:57:46.823 --> 00:57:48.939
*Fine, if you're so sure now.*

685
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.278
*Go ahead then give him, THIS!*

686
00:57:51.279 --> 00:57:52.469
How did you?

687
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:54.366
*This is why he's here.*

688
00:57:54.368 --> 00:57:55.749
*Don't let him deceive you.*

689
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:59.183
*Give it to him, watch, you'll see.*
- I will.

690
00:57:59.184 --> 00:58:02.819
*Trust me my dear, that's
how fast he'll leave you.*

691
00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:06.673
*I won't say I told you so...no.*

692
00:58:06.674 --> 00:58:08.931
*Rapunzel knows best.*

693
00:58:08.932 --> 00:58:10.619
*So if he's such a dream boat.*

694
00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:14.488
*Go and put him, to the test.*
- Mother, wait.

695
00:58:14.489 --> 00:58:20.336
*If he's lying, don't come crying.*

696
00:58:20.337 --> 00:58:26.941
*Mother, knows best.*

697
00:58:31.409 --> 00:58:35.131
So, hey uh, can I ask you something?

698
00:58:35.884 --> 00:58:39.375
Is there any chance that I'm going
to get super strength in my hand?

699
00:58:39.376 --> 00:58:42.323
Because I'm not going to
lie. That would be stupendous.

700
00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:45.501
Hey, you all right?

701
00:58:45.896 --> 00:58:48.184
Oh, sorry, yes.

702
00:58:48.185 --> 00:58:51.417
Just um, lost in thought, I guess.

703
00:58:53.664 --> 00:58:55.729
I mean because here's the thing.

704
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:57.768
Superhuman good looks,
I've always had 'em.

705
00:58:57.769 --> 00:59:00.560
Born with it, but superhuman strength?

706
00:59:00.561 --> 00:59:03.306
Can you imagine the
possibilities, I'm just...

707
00:59:07.933 --> 00:59:14.632
Patience boys. All good
things to those who wait.

708
00:59:29.281 --> 00:59:30.381
Hmm, what?

709
00:59:33.574 --> 00:59:36.020
Well I hope you're here to apologize.

710
00:59:39.641 --> 00:59:44.094
No, no put me down.
Stop it. Let...me...go!

711
00:59:45.116 --> 00:59:47.330
- Give me, him.
- OW!

712
00:59:58.323 --> 01:00:00.840
Easy boy, easy, calm down.

713
01:00:02.913 --> 01:00:04.135
Easy boy.

714
01:00:04.992 --> 01:00:06.213
Easy.

715
01:00:07.945 --> 01:00:09.675
That's it.

716
01:00:13.246 --> 01:00:14.976
Now sit.

717
01:00:15.842 --> 01:00:17.808
- Sit.
- What?

718
01:00:17.809 --> 01:00:19.720
Now drop the boot.

719
01:00:19.902 --> 01:00:21.361
Drop it.

720
01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:26.426
Oh, you are such a good boy.

721
01:00:26.427 --> 01:00:28.913
Yes you are.

722
01:00:30.342 --> 01:00:33.946
You all tired, from chasing
the bad man all over the place?

723
01:00:33.947 --> 01:00:35.089
Excuse me?

724
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:37.987
Nobody appreciates you, do they?

725
01:00:37.988 --> 01:00:39.018
Do they?

726
01:00:39.019 --> 01:00:41.604
Oh come on, he's a bad horse.

727
01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:44.107
Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.

728
01:00:44.108 --> 01:00:45.926
Isn't that right?

729
01:00:46.951 --> 01:00:48.189
Maximus.

730
01:00:49.155 --> 01:00:50.898
You've got to be kidding me.

731
01:00:51.357 --> 01:00:55.840
Look, today is kinda the
biggest day of my life.

732
01:00:56.418 --> 01:01:00.880
And the thing is, I need
you not to get him arrested.

733
01:01:01.112 --> 01:01:03.594
Just for twenty four hours and then,

734
01:01:03.595 --> 01:01:05.854
you can chase each other
to your hearts content.

735
01:01:05.855 --> 01:01:06.908
Okay?

736
01:01:11.117 --> 01:01:14.940
And it's also my
birthday. Just so you know.

737
01:02:06.588 --> 01:02:08.456
Sorry.

738
01:02:31.177 --> 01:02:32.276
Thank you.

739
01:02:48.023 --> 01:02:50.422
It's for the lost Princess.

740
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:10.211
To the boats

741
01:04:21.337 --> 01:04:22.744
Hey, Max.

742
01:04:26.021 --> 01:04:28.491
What? I brought them.

743
01:04:31.713 --> 01:04:33.543
Most of them.

744
01:04:34.711 --> 01:04:36.296
Where are we going?

745
01:04:36.298 --> 01:04:38.550
Well, best day of your life.

746
01:04:38.551 --> 01:04:40.552
I figured you should have a decent seat.

747
01:04:58.489 --> 01:05:00.084
You okay?

748
01:05:01.222 --> 01:05:02.754
I'm terrified.

749
01:05:03.424 --> 01:05:05.101
Why?

750
01:05:05.403 --> 01:05:09.720
I've been looking out the
window for eighteen years.

751
01:05:09.721 --> 01:05:14.570
Dreaming about what it would feel
like when those lights rise in the sky.

752
01:05:16.047 --> 01:05:19.767
What if it's not everything
that I dreamed it would be?

753
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.757
It will be.

754
01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:27.097
And what if it is?

755
01:05:28.268 --> 01:05:30.202
What will I do then?

756
01:05:30.203 --> 01:05:31.964
Well that's the good part, I guess.

757
01:05:32.777 --> 01:05:34.936
You get to go find a new dream.

758
01:07:08.042 --> 01:07:14.186
*All those days Watching
from the windows.*

759
01:07:14.187 --> 01:07:19.067
*All those years Outside looking in*

760
01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:24.194
*All that time Never even knowing*

761
01:07:24.195 --> 01:07:31.200
*Just how blind I've been Now I'm here*

762
01:07:31.201 --> 01:07:36.130
*Blinking in the starlight Now I'm here*

763
01:07:36.131 --> 01:07:41.047
*Suddenly I see Standing here*

764
01:07:41.048 --> 01:07:48.161
*It's oh, so clear I'm
where I'm meant to be*

765
01:07:48.162 --> 01:07:57.401
*And at last, I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted*

766
01:07:57.402 --> 01:08:06.373
*And at last, I see the light
And it's like the sky is new*

767
01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:16.374
*And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*

768
01:08:19.952 --> 01:08:24.664
*All at once Everything looks different*

769
01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:29.556
*Now that I see you*

770
01:08:35.457 --> 01:08:37.123
I have something for you, too.

771
01:08:37.929 --> 01:08:41.389
I should have given it to you
before, but I was just scared.

772
01:08:41.553 --> 01:08:45.325
And the thing is, I'm
not scared anymore.

773
01:08:45.326 --> 01:08:46.793
You know what I mean?

774
01:08:46.794 --> 01:08:49.644
I'm starting to.

775
01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:59.046
*All those days Chasing down a daydream*

776
01:08:59.047 --> 01:09:03.413
*All those years Living in a blur*

777
01:09:03.414 --> 01:09:08.579
*All that time Never truly seeing*

778
01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:15.368
*Things, the way they
were Now she's here*

779
01:09:15.369 --> 01:09:20.176
*Shining in the
starlight Now she's here*

780
01:09:20.177 --> 01:09:24.740
*Suddenly I know If she's here*

781
01:09:24.742 --> 01:09:31.738
*It's crystal clear I'm
where I'm meant to go*

782
01:09:31.739 --> 01:09:36.186
*And at last, I see the light*

783
01:09:36.187 --> 01:09:40.180
*And it's like the fog has lifted*

784
01:09:40.181 --> 01:09:44.752
*And at last, I see the light*

785
01:09:44.753 --> 01:09:48.996
*And it's like the sky is new*

786
01:09:48.997 --> 01:09:58.997
*And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*

787
01:10:02.414 --> 01:10:07.449
*All at once Everything is different*

788
01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:12.039
*Now that I, see you.*

789
01:10:16.604 --> 01:10:26.495
*Now that I...see you.*

790
01:10:42.769 --> 01:10:45.468
Is everything okay?

791
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:48.378
Huh? Oh yes.

792
01:10:48.379 --> 01:10:50.584
Uh, yes of course.

793
01:10:50.585 --> 01:10:52.603
I just...

794
01:10:58.194 --> 01:10:59.884
I'm sorry, everything is fine.

795
01:11:00.969 --> 01:11:02.494
There's just something
I have to take care of.

796
01:11:05.567 --> 01:11:07.181
Okay.

797
01:11:08.447 --> 01:11:10.473
I'll be right back.

798
01:11:16.449 --> 01:11:18.366
It's all right, Pascal.

799
01:11:26.168 --> 01:11:27.725
Ahh, there you are.

800
01:11:27.726 --> 01:11:30.896
I've been searching everywhere for
you guys. Since we got separated.

801
01:11:30.897 --> 01:11:33.396
Hey the sideburns are
coming in nice, huh?

802
01:11:33.398 --> 01:11:34.964
You gotta be excited about that.

803
01:11:37.164 --> 01:11:40.298
Anyhow, just wanted to say,

804
01:11:40.299 --> 01:11:43.159
I shouldn't have split.
The crown is all yours.

805
01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.371
I'll miss you, but I
think its for the... best.

806
01:11:48.583 --> 01:11:52.029
Holding out on us again? Hey, Ryder?

807
01:11:52.284 --> 01:11:55.287
- What?
- We heard you found something.

808
01:11:55.288 --> 01:11:58.433
Something much more
valuable than a crown.

809
01:11:58.913 --> 01:12:02.232
We want her, instead.

810
01:12:11.202 --> 01:12:15.894
I was starting to think you ran
off with the crown and left me.

811
01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:24.017
He did.

812
01:12:24.742 --> 01:12:27.003
What? No.

813
01:12:27.004 --> 01:12:28.027
He wouldn't.

814
01:12:28.794 --> 01:12:30.669
See for yourself.

815
01:12:35.066 --> 01:12:36.505
Eugene?

816
01:12:39.092 --> 01:12:40.471
Eugene!

817
01:12:43.053 --> 01:12:44.718
Fair trade.

818
01:12:44.719 --> 01:12:48.350
A crown, for the girl
with the magic hair.

819
01:12:48.351 --> 01:12:53.314
How much do you think someone will
pay to stay young and healthy forever?

820
01:12:53.315 --> 01:12:55.159
No, please.

821
01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.483
NO!

822
01:12:56.781 --> 01:12:57.851
NO!

823
01:13:06.208 --> 01:13:07.532
Rapunzel!

824
01:13:09.016 --> 01:13:10.034
Mother?

825
01:13:14.976 --> 01:13:17.686
Oh, my precious girl.

826
01:13:17.687 --> 01:13:19.377
Mother.

827
01:13:20.005 --> 01:13:21.533
Are you all right?

828
01:13:21.534 --> 01:13:22.864
Are you hurt?

829
01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:26.332
- Mother, how did you?
- I was so worried about you dear.

830
01:13:26.333 --> 01:13:27.744
So I followed you.

831
01:13:27.745 --> 01:13:29.609
And I saw them attack you.

832
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:32.433
All right, let's go, let's
go before they come to.

833
01:14:02.505 --> 01:14:04.220
You were right, mother.

834
01:14:04.221 --> 01:14:06.867
You were right about everything.

835
01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:09.539
I know darling.

836
01:14:11.107 --> 01:14:12.125
I know.

837
01:14:24.984 --> 01:14:26.179
Look!

838
01:14:26.939 --> 01:14:28.162
The crown.

839
01:14:28.682 --> 01:14:30.107
Rapunzel.

840
01:14:30.711 --> 01:14:32.165
RAPUNZEL!

841
01:14:35.223 --> 01:14:36.704
No, no, no. Wait,
wait, wait. Guys, guys.

842
01:14:39.588 --> 01:14:41.537
Rapunzel!

843
01:15:00.935 --> 01:15:03.111
Let's get this over with, Ryder.

844
01:15:04.951 --> 01:15:06.464
Where are we going?

845
01:15:14.402 --> 01:15:16.986
There, it never happened.

846
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:21.587
Now, wash up for dinner.

847
01:15:21.592 --> 01:15:24.290
I'm making hazel nut soup.

848
01:15:28.698 --> 01:15:31.797
I really did try, Rapunzel.

849
01:15:31.798 --> 01:15:34.027
I tried to warn you, what was out there.

850
01:15:34.924 --> 01:15:37.949
The world is dark, and selfish,

851
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:39.188
and cruel.

852
01:15:39.188 --> 01:15:42.408
If it finds even the
slightest ray of sunshine.

853
01:15:42.409 --> 01:15:45.340
It destroys it.

854
01:17:27.055 --> 01:17:29.072
How did you know about her?

855
01:17:29.074 --> 01:17:30.223
Tell me, now!

856
01:17:30.224 --> 01:17:31.474
It wasn't us.

857
01:17:31.474 --> 01:17:32.945
It was the old lady.

858
01:17:32.946 --> 01:17:34.575
Old lady?

859
01:17:36.541 --> 01:17:38.068
Wait, no, wait!

860
01:17:38.069 --> 01:17:39.902
You don't understand, she's in trouble.

861
01:17:39.903 --> 01:17:40.862
Wait!

862
01:17:41.118 --> 01:17:42.136
Rapunzel?

863
01:17:44.054 --> 01:17:45.957
Rapunzel, what's going on up there?

864
01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:51.723
Are you all right?

865
01:17:53.103 --> 01:17:54.664
I'm the lost princess.

866
01:17:55.146 --> 01:17:58.769
Oh, please, speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.

867
01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:00.655
I am the lost Princess.

868
01:18:01.389 --> 01:18:02.696
Aren't I?

869
01:18:05.949 --> 01:18:08.377
Did I mumble, Mother?

870
01:18:08.843 --> 01:18:11.320
Or should I even call you that?

871
01:18:12.866 --> 01:18:15.838
Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

872
01:18:15.839 --> 01:18:18.436
Why would you ask such
a ridiculous question?

873
01:18:18.437 --> 01:18:21.644
It was you! It was all, you.

874
01:18:23.868 --> 01:18:27.523
Everything I did, was to protect you.

875
01:18:29.119 --> 01:18:32.286
- Rapunzel.
- I spent my entire life,

876
01:18:32.287 --> 01:18:35.260
Hiding from people who
would use me for my power.

877
01:18:35.261 --> 01:18:37.741
- Rapunzel!
- And I should have been hiding.

878
01:18:37.742 --> 01:18:38.785
From you.

879
01:18:38.786 --> 01:18:39.997
Where will you go?

880
01:18:39.997 --> 01:18:41.984
He won't be there for you.

881
01:18:41.985 --> 01:18:43.811
What did you do to him?

882
01:18:43.812 --> 01:18:47.797
That criminal, is to be
hanged for his crimes.

883
01:18:47.914 --> 01:18:51.506
- No.
- Now, now. It's all right.

884
01:18:51.507 --> 01:18:52.568
Listen to me.

885
01:18:52.569 --> 01:18:56.061
All of this is as it should be.

886
01:18:56.062 --> 01:18:57.168
NO!

887
01:18:57.885 --> 01:19:00.493
You were wrong about the world.

888
01:19:00.494 --> 01:19:02.739
And you were wrong about me.

889
01:19:02.741 --> 01:19:07.245
And I will never let
you use my hair, again!

890
01:19:16.622 --> 01:19:18.271
You want me to be the bad guy?

891
01:19:18.272 --> 01:19:20.168
Fine.

892
01:19:20.169 --> 01:19:22.693
Now I'm the bad, guy.

893
01:19:36.786 --> 01:19:38.118
What's this?

894
01:19:38.513 --> 01:19:39.998
Open up.

895
01:19:41.002 --> 01:19:42.809
What's the password?

896
01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:44.574
- What?
- Nope.

897
01:19:44.575 --> 01:19:46.207
Open this door.

898
01:19:46.208 --> 01:19:48.112
Not even close.

899
01:19:48.113 --> 01:19:49.312
You have three seconds

900
01:19:49.313 --> 01:19:50.701
One...

901
01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:52.936
Two...

902
01:19:54.751 --> 01:19:56.047
Three...

903
01:20:01.013 --> 01:20:03.729
Frying pans. Who knew, right?

904
01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:34.598
- Head down?
- Head down.

905
01:20:34.599 --> 01:20:35.708
- Arms in?
- Arms in.

906
01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:36.783
- Knees apart?
- Knees apart.

907
01:20:36.784 --> 01:20:37.767
Knees apart?

908
01:20:38.341 --> 01:20:40.954
Why do I need to keep my knees apar...

909
01:20:48.267 --> 01:20:49.676
Max.

910
01:20:49.689 --> 01:20:51.680
You brought them here?

911
01:20:53.911 --> 01:20:55.070
Thank you.

912
01:20:56.435 --> 01:20:59.118
No really, thank you.

913
01:20:59.118 --> 01:21:04.833
Uh, I feel maybe this whole time we've
just misunderstanding one another.

914
01:21:04.834 --> 01:21:08.006
And we're really just, yeah
your right. We should go.

915
01:21:15.684 --> 01:21:16.784
Max.

916
01:21:17.297 --> 01:21:18.324
Max!

917
01:21:30.028 --> 01:21:33.597
Okay Max, lets see how fast you can run.

918
01:21:52.313 --> 01:21:53.975
Rapunzel.

919
01:21:55.543 --> 01:21:57.456
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

920
01:22:13.206 --> 01:22:15.675
Rapunzel, I thought
I'd never see you again.

921
01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:26.535
Now look what you've done, Rapunzel.

922
01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:28.958
Oh don't worry, dear.

923
01:22:28.959 --> 01:22:31.317
Our secret will die with him.

924
01:22:32.762 --> 01:22:34.772
And as for us?

925
01:22:36.321 --> 01:22:40.878
We are going where no one
will ever find you, again.

926
01:22:47.354 --> 01:22:50.856
Rapunzel, really. Enough all ready.

927
01:22:50.857 --> 01:22:53.354
Stop fighting me.

928
01:22:53.356 --> 01:22:55.766
NO! I won't stop.

929
01:22:55.767 --> 01:22:59.439
For every minute of the
rest of my life I will fight.

930
01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.257
I will never stop trying
to get away from you.

931
01:23:05.471 --> 01:23:08.167
But, if you let me save him...

932
01:23:08.168 --> 01:23:09.868
I will go with you.

933
01:23:10.554 --> 01:23:13.837
No. No, Rapunzel.

934
01:23:14.111 --> 01:23:17.754
I'll never run, I'll
never try to escape.

935
01:23:17.755 --> 01:23:21.555
Just let me heal him. And
you and I will be together.

936
01:23:21.556 --> 01:23:23.360
Forever, just like you want.

937
01:23:23.361 --> 01:23:25.594
Everything will be the way it was.

938
01:23:26.642 --> 01:23:28.637
I promise.

939
01:23:28.957 --> 01:23:30.759
Just like you want.

940
01:23:33.808 --> 01:23:37.096
Just...let me...heal him.

941
01:23:42.947 --> 01:23:46.557
In case you get any
ideas about following us.

942
01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:49.497
Eu..Eugene!

943
01:23:54.717 --> 01:23:57.412
Oh, I'm so sorry.

944
01:23:57.413 --> 01:23:59.941
- Everything is going to okay, though.
- No, Rapunzel!

945
01:23:59.942 --> 01:24:02.346
- I promise, you have to trust me.
- No..

946
01:24:02.347 --> 01:24:05.112
- Come on.
- I can't let you do this.

947
01:24:05.113 --> 01:24:07.722
And I can't let you die.

948
01:24:07.723 --> 01:24:10.434
- But if you do this.
- Shhh.

949
01:24:10.436 --> 01:24:12.571
- Then you...will die.
- Hey.

950
01:24:13.852 --> 01:24:15.609
It's gonna be all right.

951
01:24:20.875 --> 01:24:23.930
Rapunzel, wait...

952
01:24:33.188 --> 01:24:35.190
Eugene, what...?

953
01:24:35.267 --> 01:24:36.897
NOOO!

954
01:24:41.711 --> 01:24:44.619
No...NO!

955
01:24:45.081 --> 01:24:49.037
What have you done? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!

956
01:24:55.425 --> 01:24:58.496
No, no, no, NOOO!

957
01:24:59.036 --> 01:25:02.768
No, no, no, noooo.

958
01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:05.697
NO!

959
01:25:06.776 --> 01:25:08.713
Noooooooooo!

960
01:25:26.936 --> 01:25:29.442
No, no, no, no, Eugene.

961
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:34.630
Oh, look at me, look me, I'm right here.

962
01:25:34.631 --> 01:25:36.736
Don't go, stay with me, Eugene.

963
01:25:36.736 --> 01:25:40.109
*Flower gleam and glow,
Let your powers shine*

964
01:25:40.110 --> 01:25:43.900
*Make the clock reverse,
bring back what once was mine.*

965
01:25:43.901 --> 01:25:46.285
- Rapunzel...
- What?

966
01:25:48.972 --> 01:25:51.016
You were my new dream.

967
01:25:54.332 --> 01:25:56.259
And you were mine.

968
01:26:22.638 --> 01:26:26.416
*Heal what has been hurt.*

969
01:26:27.296 --> 01:26:31.572
*Change the fates design.*

970
01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.676
*Save what has been lost.*

971
01:26:38.236 --> 01:26:41.221
*Bring back what once was mine.*

972
01:26:44.221 --> 01:26:46.716
What once was mine.

973
01:27:43.130 --> 01:27:44.835
Rapunzel?

974
01:27:46.193 --> 01:27:47.373
Eugene.

975
01:27:49.289 --> 01:27:52.564
Did I ever tell you, I've
got a thing for brunettes?

976
01:29:35.368 --> 01:29:39.525
Well, you could imagine
what happened next.

977
01:29:41.206 --> 01:29:43.083
The kingdom rejoiced.

978
01:29:43.084 --> 01:29:44.895
For the lost Princess had returned.

979
01:29:44.896 --> 01:29:47.053
The party lasted an entire week.

980
01:29:47.054 --> 01:29:49.669
And, honestly I don't
remember much of it.

981
01:29:50.594 --> 01:29:52.298
Dreams came true all over the place.

982
01:29:52.299 --> 01:29:56.513
That guy went on to become the most famous concert
pianist in the world, if you can believe it.

983
01:29:59.092 --> 01:30:01.724
And this guy? Well he
eventually found true love.

984
01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.798
As for this guy, well,
I assume he's happy.

985
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:07.310
He's never told me otherwise.

986
01:30:09.626 --> 01:30:13.785
Thanks to Maximus, crime in the
kingdom disappeared almost over night.

987
01:30:15.401 --> 01:30:17.250
As did most of the apples.

988
01:30:19.407 --> 01:30:22.426
Pascal? Never changed.

989
01:30:26.166 --> 01:30:28.547
At last Rapunzel was home,

990
01:30:28.548 --> 01:30:30.241
and she finally had a real family.

991
01:30:31.898 --> 01:30:34.046
She was a Princess worth waiting for.

992
01:30:34.748 --> 01:30:36.447
Beloved by all, she led her kingdom

993
01:30:36.448 --> 01:30:39.788
with all the grace and wisdom
that her parents did before her.

994
01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:42.553
And as for me, well.

995
01:30:42.554 --> 01:30:44.132
I started going by Eugene again.

996
01:30:44.133 --> 01:30:46.276
Stopped thieving, and
basically turned it all around.

997
01:30:46.277 --> 01:30:48.017
But I know what the big question is.

998
01:30:48.888 --> 01:30:50.674
Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?

999
01:30:51.307 --> 01:30:52.340
Well I'm pleased to tell you.

1000
01:30:52.343 --> 01:30:55.107
That after years, and years of asking,

1001
01:30:55.108 --> 01:30:57.108
and asking, and asking.

1002
01:30:58.805 --> 01:31:00.729
I finally said yes.

1003
01:31:00.942 --> 01:31:02.493
*Eugene*

1004
01:31:02.495 --> 01:31:05.275
All right, I asked her.

1005
01:31:05.276 --> 01:31:07.348
And we're living happily ever after.

1006
01:31:08.615 --> 01:31:10.018
Yes, we are.
