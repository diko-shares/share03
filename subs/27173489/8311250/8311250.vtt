00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:12.700
Duckett! Answer your phone.

2
00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:14.408
My messages are delivering,

3
00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.242
so I know you're
fuckin' seeing 'em.

4
00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:17.825
Yo. Seen Duckett?

5
00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:19.992
Yeah, he's inside. He's
fucking off his head.

6
00:01:19.993 --> 00:01:22.118
{\an8}Bro, he's definitely
on something, eh?

7
00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:26.868
Hey, is Duckett up there?
Who the fuck is Duckett?

8
00:01:34.743 --> 00:01:36.533
Oi! Any of you seen Duckett?

9
00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:38.118
No, I haven't!

10
00:01:43.618 --> 00:01:45.951
Oi. Oi, seen Duckett?

11
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:56.200
Cole! Get your
brother under control.

12
00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:58.659
- Where is he?
- He's in Jayden's room. Go.

13
00:02:01.034 --> 00:02:03.325
Dude, what's your
brother's deal?

14
00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:04.617
Duckett!

15
00:02:04.618 --> 00:02:06.825
Open the door, man! I'm
not screwing around.

16
00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:08.992
Mate, I'm this close
to calling the cops.

17
00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:11.242
Duckett, open the door
or I'll break it down.

18
00:02:11.243 --> 00:02:13.201
- What?!

19
00:02:14.826 --> 00:02:18.033
Dude, what the hell?! You're
gonna break my mum's door!

20
00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:19.658
Nah, fuck this!

21
00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.201
Cole's breaking my
fuckin'... Duckett.

22
00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.367
Can you see them?
They're in here.

23
00:02:26.368 --> 00:02:28.408
I'm gonna take
you home. OK, bro?

24
00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.034
Pop said you're gonna
hurt a lot of people.

25
00:02:33.784 --> 00:02:35.451
Pop's dead, Duckett.

26
00:02:37.868 --> 00:02:39.575
You're not him.

27
00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.243
What are you talking about?

28
00:02:44.076 --> 00:02:46.117
Bro, look at
Duckett. He's fucked!

29
00:02:46.118 --> 00:02:47.784
Are you serious?

30
00:02:48.784 --> 00:02:50.326
Put your phones down!

31
00:02:51.534 --> 00:02:53.533
Put your fuckin' phones away!

32
00:02:53.534 --> 00:02:55.242
Hey, hey, bro...

33
00:02:55.243 --> 00:02:56.868
Everyone fuck off!

34
00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:03.451
It's a knife!

35
00:03:36.493 --> 00:03:38.868
<i>What are you doing?</i>

36
00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:52.408
<i>Get off me. Get off!</i>

37
00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.200
<i>- Mum!</i>

38
00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:56.158
Sorry.

39
00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.158
No, I am.

40
00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.242
I just needed a moment.

41
00:04:00.243 --> 00:04:02.076
Your aunty wants to talk to you.

42
00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.701
Yeah, OK.

43
00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.493
I've still got her
name in Contacts.

44
00:04:12.493 --> 00:04:15.743
I should take her out,
but I just can't do it.

45
00:04:17.076 --> 00:04:18.784
Yeah, me neither.

46
00:04:23.993 --> 00:04:25.825
You thought about
what you're gonna do

47
00:04:25.826 --> 00:04:27.533
when you finish school?

48
00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:28.826
Mmm...

49
00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:31.618
Work with your dad?

50
00:04:39.868 --> 00:04:41.576
You getting a cold, Mi?

51
00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:44.408
What?

52
00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.367
You getting a cold?

53
00:04:46.368 --> 00:04:48.451
Uh, yeah, I think so.

54
00:04:54.534 --> 00:04:56.283
How was today for you?

55
00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:58.325
- What?

56
00:04:58.326 --> 00:05:00.243
How was today for you?

57
00:05:01.284 --> 00:05:02.826
Fine.

58
00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:11.742
Hey. <i>Hey, Mia.</i>

59
00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:14.492
<i>- Can you come pick me up?</i>
- Oh, OK, now?

60
00:05:14.493 --> 00:05:16.408
- Where'd you go?
- I was on the phone.

61
00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.450
My sister was meant
to be picking me up.

62
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.200
My fat mum's meant
to pick me up.

63
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:22.243
She's probably off
eating dick somewhere.

64
00:05:25.284 --> 00:05:26.783
Is that Alex?

65
00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:29.075
Yeah, his Snapchats
are so cringe.

66
00:05:29.076 --> 00:05:31.117
He looks like my
mum in half of 'em.

67
00:05:31.118 --> 00:05:34.450
- He looks elvish.
- What's elvish?

68
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:36.284
You know, like
the fantasy elves.

69
00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:38.783
Shut up.

70
00:05:38.784 --> 00:05:41.200
I swear he stole one
of my cigarettes.

71
00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:42.867
You smoke now?

72
00:05:42.868 --> 00:05:45.742
Nah, I just sell 'em. I
sold, like, two to him today.

73
00:05:45.743 --> 00:05:47.742
He's such a tryhard.

74
00:05:47.743 --> 00:05:50.117
He invited me to
his house to hang.

75
00:05:50.118 --> 00:05:51.950
I thought you hated him.

76
00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:53.242
Eh.

77
00:05:53.243 --> 00:05:55.950
Do you reckon they give
you cancer straightaway?

78
00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:57.950
I don't know. Don't smoke it?

79
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:59.618
Don't tell me what to do.

80
00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.159
Here you go.

81
00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.408
Nah.

82
00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.033
I hate the smell.

83
00:06:11.034 --> 00:06:12.618
You're a fuckin' foetus.

84
00:06:13.618 --> 00:06:15.326
I need a new best mate.

85
00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:18.534
Put it out, quick.

86
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.075
Riley! You little
feral. Cigarettes?

87
00:06:25.076 --> 00:06:26.700
We weren't actually
smoking them.

88
00:06:26.701 --> 00:06:27.867
He's lying, Mia.

89
00:06:27.868 --> 00:06:30.242
- He's had half a packet.
- Need a lift anywhere?

90
00:06:30.243 --> 00:06:32.325
Nah, Mum's getting here
soon. Thanks, though.

91
00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:34.408
Alright. Call Riley if
she doesn't rock up.

92
00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.117
Alright, thanks. Have
fun with your cancer.

93
00:06:37.118 --> 00:06:40.451
- See ya, Mia. See ya, foetus!

Oh, shit.

You poor thing. What do we do?

106
00:07:34.534 --> 00:07:36.825
Do we call a vet?

107
00:07:36.826 --> 00:07:39.325
That's not gonna help,
Riley. I mean, look at it.

108
00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:41.659
We can't just
leave it like that.

109
00:07:42.868 --> 00:07:45.326
Can you at least put
it out of its misery?

110
00:07:46.534 --> 00:07:47.659
OK.

111
00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:16.617
Mia, no, we can't
leave it like this.

112
00:08:16.618 --> 00:08:18.408
Another car will come.

113
00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:20.034
Mia, it's crying.

114
00:08:48.826 --> 00:08:51.200
- Oh! Hey!

115
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:53.492
Ow. Love it when you
rock up uninvited.

116
00:08:53.493 --> 00:08:55.700
Love it when you forget
to pick up Riley.

117
00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:57.117
Ow!

118
00:08:57.118 --> 00:08:59.117
I'm sorry. I had you on mute.

119
00:08:59.118 --> 00:09:00.867
Ah, cool story.
I'm telling Mum.

120
00:09:00.868 --> 00:09:02.701
No, you're not! Yes, I am!

121
00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:05.950
Thanks for picking him up, Mi.

122
00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:07.992
All good. Come on, Cookie.

123
00:09:07.993 --> 00:09:09.617
Oh, God, you stink!

124
00:09:09.618 --> 00:09:11.618
Oh, you're a smelly girl!

125
00:09:26.243 --> 00:09:27.867
Saw a dying kangaroo.

126
00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:29.075
What?

127
00:09:29.076 --> 00:09:32.908
On the side of the road.
It was in so much pain.

128
00:09:32.909 --> 00:09:34.868
Why didn't you call the RSPCA?

129
00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.325
I dunno.

130
00:09:38.326 --> 00:09:40.283
It was almost dead.

131
00:09:40.284 --> 00:09:42.534
I wanted to put it
out of its misery.

132
00:09:48.118 --> 00:09:50.325
Thanks for ignoring
my calls, by the way.

133
00:09:50.326 --> 00:09:53.117
I haven't been ignoring
your calls. I've been busy.

134
00:09:53.118 --> 00:09:55.451
Uh, yeah, busy ignoring me.

135
00:09:57.743 --> 00:09:59.742
- No, Jade, don't. Don't!
- What?

136
00:09:59.743 --> 00:10:01.783
Don't answer it! I
let a kangaroo suffer.

137
00:10:01.784 --> 00:10:03.659
- Daniel...
- I need consoling!

138
00:10:04.826 --> 00:10:06.367
<i>Is that Mia?</i>

139
00:10:06.368 --> 00:10:08.408
- I'll call you back, yeah?
<i>- OK, sure.</i>

140
00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:09.533
OK, bye.

141
00:10:09.534 --> 00:10:11.992
Bye! Bye, Daniel! Bye!

142
00:10:11.993 --> 00:10:14.993
Oh! Alright. I'm consoling you.

143
00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:19.492
- Have you seen the group chat?
- The one I invited you to?

144
00:10:19.493 --> 00:10:22.242
Hayley's video. They're
doing it again tonight.

145
00:10:22.243 --> 00:10:23.950
- No, Mia.
- To see if it's real!

146
00:10:23.951 --> 00:10:25.909
No, not tonight, Mia. I can't.

147
00:10:32.826 --> 00:10:34.659
It was Mum's two years.

148
00:10:35.993 --> 00:10:37.576
That was today?

149
00:10:38.659 --> 00:10:40.159
Yeah.

150
00:10:41.826 --> 00:10:43.576
I just want to forget about it.

151
00:10:45.118 --> 00:10:47.200
And...

152
00:10:47.201 --> 00:10:50.034
I need Daniel to come give
my gucci some attention.

153
00:10:52.076 --> 00:10:54.950
Oh! Daniel's not
touching your gucci, Mia!

154
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:56.992
He was my boyfriend
before he was yours.

155
00:10:56.993 --> 00:10:59.033
You guys held hands
once three years ago.

156
00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:01.617
- That doesn't mean anything.
- Jade.

157
00:11:01.618 --> 00:11:05.118
It's my mum's
remembrance day. Please?

158
00:11:10.368 --> 00:11:12.533
Daniel can come, too, yeah?

159
00:11:12.534 --> 00:11:15.158
If he's touching my gucci, yes.

160
00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:16.451
- Stop!

161
00:11:18.701 --> 00:11:20.325
Can you give me five minutes?

162
00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:22.158
What am I gonna do
for five minutes?

163
00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:24.325
Oh, I don't know. Wash
Cookie or something!

164
00:11:24.326 --> 00:11:26.492
I don't wanna wash Cookie!

165
00:11:26.493 --> 00:11:29.825
Oh, fine! I will babysit
Riley - the better sibling.

166
00:11:29.826 --> 00:11:32.242
Do not talk about your
gucci with Riley, please.

167
00:11:32.243 --> 00:11:34.408
He has got to learn!
The boy's got to learn!

168
00:11:34.409 --> 00:11:36.492
- Bye.
- Miss you already. Bye.

169
00:11:36.493 --> 00:11:38.076
- Love you.

170
00:11:53.284 --> 00:11:54.867
"Can I help?"

171
00:11:54.868 --> 00:11:57.076
"Yes, Riley, thank
you for asking."

172
00:12:06.409 --> 00:12:08.075
Need a hand?

173
00:12:08.076 --> 00:12:10.825
I'm sorry I couldn't
get to your mum's thing.

174
00:12:10.826 --> 00:12:12.450
I couldn't get off work.

175
00:12:12.451 --> 00:12:13.908
No, it's fine.

176
00:12:13.909 --> 00:12:15.493
How's your dad?

177
00:12:16.784 --> 00:12:18.367
Oh, hey...

178
00:12:18.368 --> 00:12:20.742
You can be honest.

179
00:12:20.743 --> 00:12:22.992
I hate being around him.

180
00:12:22.993 --> 00:12:24.659
He's so depressing.

181
00:12:25.826 --> 00:12:28.118
I'm a bad person,
Sue. Can you fix me?

182
00:12:29.409 --> 00:12:31.034
You're not broken, Mia.

183
00:12:32.701 --> 00:12:34.158
- Whoa. OK.

184
00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:36.158
Ugh, God, I'm dying.

185
00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:38.242
It's just a cold.
You'll kick it.

186
00:12:38.243 --> 00:12:39.742
Thank you.

187
00:12:39.743 --> 00:12:41.993
Riley, get your
shit off the table.

188
00:12:44.493 --> 00:12:46.033
Did you hear me?

189
00:12:46.034 --> 00:12:48.534
Yes, Mum, I'm coming. OK.

190
00:12:58.451 --> 00:13:00.783
Mum? You going to bed?

191
00:13:00.784 --> 00:13:03.492
- You sneaking out?
- Why do you always think

192
00:13:03.493 --> 00:13:05.492
I'm sneaking out or
I'm sleeping around?

193
00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.325
You only ask if I'm going to
bed when you're sneaking out.

194
00:13:08.326 --> 00:13:09.909
Is it to see Daniel?

195
00:13:10.909 --> 00:13:13.200
You know, even if it was,
he's ultra Christian.

196
00:13:13.201 --> 00:13:16.450
- He doesn't do anything ever.
- He's still got a dick, Jade.

197
00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:18.325
Is it him you're
sneaking out to see?

198
00:13:18.326 --> 00:13:20.492
I'm not sneaking out!

199
00:13:20.493 --> 00:13:21.951
OK.

200
00:13:24.034 --> 00:13:25.243
God. Night.

201
00:13:27.118 --> 00:13:28.868
Lock the door on your way out.

202
00:13:30.493 --> 00:13:32.242
- Are we sneaking out now?
- Shh!

203
00:13:32.243 --> 00:13:33.867
Bye, Mia.
- Oh, God!

204
00:13:33.868 --> 00:13:35.368
I didn't tell on you.

205
00:13:36.576 --> 00:13:38.034
What? I didn't do anything.

206
00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:42.742
What are you doing?

207
00:13:42.743 --> 00:13:44.575
Mia said I could come.

208
00:13:44.576 --> 00:13:46.242
How could I say no to him?

209
00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:49.200
- You're not coming.
- Alright, then, I'll tell Mum.

210
00:13:49.201 --> 00:13:51.325
Yeah, well, she pretty
much already knows.

211
00:13:51.326 --> 00:13:53.243
What, about you
not picking me up?

212
00:13:55.451 --> 00:13:57.243
Whatever.

213
00:13:59.826 --> 00:14:02.742
- Yo, check this out.

214
00:14:02.743 --> 00:14:04.825
- I swear it's fake.
- Mm, I don't know.

215
00:14:04.826 --> 00:14:06.575
It's 1,000 per cent a trick.

216
00:14:06.576 --> 00:14:08.992
How would Hayley fake
that? Why would they?

217
00:14:08.993 --> 00:14:10.950
Why would they? They're
an attention whore.

218
00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:12.950
They're trying to get
everyone to talk about them

219
00:14:12.951 --> 00:14:14.575
and you've fallen for it.

220
00:14:14.576 --> 00:14:16.492
Sorry for ruining
your phone date.

221
00:14:16.493 --> 00:14:17.950
Apology not accepted.

222
00:14:17.951 --> 00:14:19.825
You'll be pregnant
next month, I swear.

223
00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:22.492
Pregnant? He hasn't
even kissed me yet.

224
00:14:22.493 --> 00:14:25.575
What? You guys have been going
out for, like, three months.

225
00:14:25.576 --> 00:14:28.367
- What is that?
- Even I've kissed Jazzie.

226
00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.992
The girl with the horse mouth?

227
00:14:29.993 --> 00:14:31.825
You shouldn't be
kissing horses, Riley.

Sick house, Joss.

247
00:15:25.993 --> 00:15:27.367
Yeah.

Yeah, just...

being weird.

254
00:15:48.493 --> 00:15:51.033
You're not being weird.
You just need to loosen up.

255
00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:52.575
Brrr!

256
00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:54.908
Yeah, just do that. It
looks incredibly normal.

257
00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:56.325
Brrr!

258
00:15:56.326 --> 00:15:57.783
Do that. Brrr!

259
00:15:57.784 --> 00:16:00.200
- Hey, Mia, brrrr!
- Fuck, I love you.

260
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:02.450
- Jade! Oh!
- Daniel!

261
00:16:02.451 --> 00:16:03.867
Finally.

262
00:16:03.868 --> 00:16:06.451
Um, hi, ex-boyfriend!

263
00:16:07.951 --> 00:16:10.075
Group hug.
- Hold me, ex-boyfriend.

264
00:16:10.076 --> 00:16:12.658
I am lonely. I
am so, so lonely!

265
00:16:12.659 --> 00:16:14.367
You right there, woman?

266
00:16:14.368 --> 00:16:16.158
I'm sorry for dragging you out.

267
00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:17.783
Nah. I wasn't doing anything.

268
00:16:17.784 --> 00:16:20.283
I actually wanted to get
out of the house for a bit.

269
00:16:20.284 --> 00:16:22.451
Wanna come grab a drink?

270
00:16:23.743 --> 00:16:25.283
I don't wanna do it.

271
00:16:25.284 --> 00:16:27.701
- They want you to do it.
- I don't wanna do it.

272
00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:31.659
How you been?

273
00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:34.283
Dude, why'd you
have to bring her?

274
00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:35.825
How you going, man?

275
00:16:35.826 --> 00:16:37.617
- Good. You?
- Yeah, good, thanks.

276
00:16:37.618 --> 00:16:40.242
First, uh, big boys' party, huh?

277
00:16:40.243 --> 00:16:41.867
I don't really know anyone.

278
00:16:41.868 --> 00:16:43.908
You'll know everyone by
the end of the night.

279
00:16:43.909 --> 00:16:45.033
Oh, good.

280
00:16:45.034 --> 00:16:46.825
- She's fine.
- No, she's not fine.

281
00:16:46.826 --> 00:16:48.533
She irritates the
fuck out of me.

282
00:16:48.534 --> 00:16:50.283
She's literally
done nothing to you.

283
00:16:50.284 --> 00:16:52.743
She's so clingy, man.
It's fucking depressing.

284
00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:56.576
Oh! Now she's flirting
with your boy.

285
00:16:57.784 --> 00:16:59.450
They're friends, Hayley.

286
00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:01.118
You keep telling yourself that.

287
00:17:02.701 --> 00:17:04.493
Alright, let's do this!

288
00:17:07.118 --> 00:17:08.993
Yeah, let's fake another video.

289
00:17:10.534 --> 00:17:12.451
I've been waiting for this shit!

290
00:17:16.243 --> 00:17:18.368
Be pretty sick to
hook the kid up.

291
00:17:19.826 --> 00:17:21.408
He's not doing anything, Joss.

292
00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:23.367
Come on, Jade.
Imagine it, though.

293
00:17:23.368 --> 00:17:24.992
Joss, I said no.

294
00:17:24.993 --> 00:17:27.368
Huh. More for me.

295
00:17:28.368 --> 00:17:30.033
Thanks, bro.

296
00:17:30.034 --> 00:17:32.200
I guess, uh, I'll
go first and...

297
00:17:32.201 --> 00:17:33.908
Nah, you always go first.

298
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:36.283
It's my house. It's
my fuckin' hand.

299
00:17:36.284 --> 00:17:39.117
Duckett gave it to me.
You're a fucking hog!

300
00:17:39.118 --> 00:17:40.908
Does anyone else
want to volunteer?

301
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:42.493
I'll do it.

302
00:17:46.993 --> 00:17:48.700
You wanna do it? Mm-hm.

303
00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:50.493
- Wanna do it?
- Yeah.

304
00:17:51.618 --> 00:17:55.118
- Do you wanna do it?!

305
00:17:59.826 --> 00:18:01.368
Sit down, Mia.

306
00:18:02.493 --> 00:18:04.450
Better her than me.
- Tie her.

307
00:18:04.451 --> 00:18:06.368
Yes, sir. Hands up.

308
00:18:09.326 --> 00:18:11.408
Mmm, kinky.

309
00:18:11.409 --> 00:18:13.159
What are we playing?

310
00:18:14.243 --> 00:18:16.575
It's nothing, Riley.
Hayley's tricked everyone.

311
00:18:16.576 --> 00:18:18.325
Alright, somebody time it.

312
00:18:18.326 --> 00:18:19.950
As soon as she lets it in,

313
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:21.783
it cannot go for
more than 90 seconds.

314
00:18:21.784 --> 00:18:23.117
Am I clear?

315
00:18:23.118 --> 00:18:25.326
What happens after 90 seconds?

316
00:18:26.534 --> 00:18:28.368
They'll want to stay.

317
00:18:30.326 --> 00:18:32.158
And if you die while
they're in you,

318
00:18:32.159 --> 00:18:35.659
well, they'll have you forever.

319
00:18:37.451 --> 00:18:38.617
So lame.

320
00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.950
Hey, I'm just relaying
what I've been told, OK?

321
00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:42.200
Oh! Fuck, dude!

322
00:18:42.201 --> 00:18:45.118
Trust me... it's gotta be tight.

323
00:18:46.784 --> 00:18:48.201
Candles?

324
00:18:49.534 --> 00:18:51.742
Light the candle
to open the door.

325
00:18:51.743 --> 00:18:53.493
Blow it out to close it.

326
00:18:59.784 --> 00:19:01.451
OK, Mia.

327
00:19:08.118 --> 00:19:09.451
Ah...

328
00:19:10.826 --> 00:19:12.368
Put your hand on it.

329
00:19:16.743 --> 00:19:18.368
No, like, hold it.

330
00:19:22.326 --> 00:19:24.117
Now say,

331
00:19:24.118 --> 00:19:26.076
"Talk to me."

332
00:19:27.368 --> 00:19:28.868
Talk to me.

333
00:19:33.701 --> 00:19:35.075
Oh, my God!

334
00:19:35.076 --> 00:19:36.784
Oh, my God, what the fuck?!

335
00:19:39.368 --> 00:19:40.908
Who the fuck was that?

336
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:42.200
Who was that?!

337
00:19:42.201 --> 00:19:44.700
I dunno, man. It's
different every time.

338
00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:46.242
- Hey, you signed up.
- Where'd he go?

339
00:19:46.243 --> 00:19:47.825
Mia, stop.

340
00:19:47.826 --> 00:19:50.575
No, you didn't do it right.
You gotta say, "I let you in."

341
00:19:50.576 --> 00:19:53.158
No, I'm flipping out.
Seriously, Mia, shut up.

342
00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:55.493
No, someone was sitting
there, I swear to fuck.

343
00:19:58.618 --> 00:20:00.408
OK, I'm proving it.

344
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:03.201
Attagirl, prove it! Prove
it. That's right, say it.

345
00:20:06.618 --> 00:20:09.117
Do it. Do it.

346
00:20:09.118 --> 00:20:12.326
Do it. Do it. Do it.

347
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:17.618
Do it! Do it! Do
it! Do it! Do it!

348
00:20:22.534 --> 00:20:25.284
- OK! OK. OK.

349
00:20:29.159 --> 00:20:30.868
Talk to me.

350
00:20:32.409 --> 00:20:34.033
Hey, don't let go, Mia.

351
00:20:34.034 --> 00:20:35.950
- Do not let go.
- I can't look at it!

352
00:20:35.951 --> 00:20:37.950
You don't have to look
at it! Just say it.

353
00:20:37.951 --> 00:20:40.201
- I can't!
- Say it!

354
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:46.243
I let you in. I let you in.

355
00:20:48.034 --> 00:20:49.576
I let you in.

356
00:20:54.451 --> 00:20:56.993
Someone timing it? Got it.

357
00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:03.825
There you are.

358
00:21:03.826 --> 00:21:05.993
Shh. Shh-shh-shh-shh.

359
00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:44.118
There he is.

360
00:21:54.993 --> 00:21:57.659
They like you.

361
00:22:00.201 --> 00:22:01.326
What?

362
00:22:02.701 --> 00:22:04.284
Oh, shit! Not you, though.

363
00:22:10.576 --> 00:22:13.159
Whoa.

364
00:22:28.534 --> 00:22:30.200
Yeah, Mia!

365
00:22:30.201 --> 00:22:32.909
He's behind you now.

366
00:22:36.493 --> 00:22:38.825
He'll split ya, pretty boy.

367
00:22:38.826 --> 00:22:40.450
He'll split ya!

368
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:42.283
83 seconds. Joss,
get it off her.

369
00:22:42.284 --> 00:22:43.992
He'll split ya!

370
00:22:43.993 --> 00:22:46.367
- Alright, you've had enough.
- He'll split ya.

371
00:22:46.368 --> 00:22:48.743
He'll split ya. He'll split ya.

372
00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:53.158
Run. Run.

373
00:22:53.159 --> 00:22:55.908
Run. Run. Run.

374
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:57.325
Run. Run.

375
00:22:57.326 --> 00:23:01.033
Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!

376
00:23:01.034 --> 00:23:03.992
- Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
- 90 seconds, for fuck sake!

377
00:23:03.993 --> 00:23:07.617
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!

378
00:23:07.618 --> 00:23:09.826
RUN! RUN! RUN! RUN! RUN!

379
00:23:13.493 --> 00:23:16.033
Hey. Hey. You OK?

380
00:23:16.034 --> 00:23:17.992
We went a bit over.

381
00:23:17.993 --> 00:23:19.409
Hey.

382
00:23:28.451 --> 00:23:30.908
That was...

383
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:33.284
amazing!

384
00:23:36.701 --> 00:23:38.659
That was the best one yet!

385
00:24:34.951 --> 00:24:37.742
Jade. Jade, are you up?

386
00:24:37.743 --> 00:24:39.659
You're not sleeping in here.

387
00:24:40.743 --> 00:24:42.533
I didn't even ask that.

388
00:24:42.534 --> 00:24:44.408
Isn't that what you want?

389
00:24:44.409 --> 00:24:46.368
No. I'm just bored.

390
00:24:47.701 --> 00:24:49.868
Look, Riley, you're not
nine anymore, alright?

391
00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:54.868
Goodnight.

392
00:24:58.409 --> 00:25:00.076
Can you shut the door?

393
00:25:01.409 --> 00:25:03.118
Shut the door!

394
00:25:06.118 --> 00:25:08.368
- Sook!

395
00:25:14.243 --> 00:25:15.868
What a bitch.

396
00:25:17.159 --> 00:25:19.158
Can I hang with you?

397
00:25:19.159 --> 00:25:20.743
It's your house, bro.

398
00:25:33.201 --> 00:25:35.326
Did the hand thing scare you?

399
00:25:37.534 --> 00:25:39.034
A bit.

400
00:25:40.034 --> 00:25:42.909
You gonna have
nightmares, Riley?

401
00:25:44.493 --> 00:25:46.284
I don't get nightmares.

402
00:25:48.534 --> 00:25:50.034
I do.

403
00:25:51.284 --> 00:25:52.784
Like what?

404
00:25:55.368 --> 00:25:58.118
I have this reoccurring
nightmare...

405
00:25:58.451 --> 00:26:00.034
where...

406
00:26:00.743 --> 00:26:03.701
I'm looking in the mirror
and my reflection is gone.

407
00:26:05.326 --> 00:26:07.243
Like I don't exist.

408
00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:14.868
What did the hand feel like?

409
00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:18.951
Mmm...

410
00:26:20.034 --> 00:26:21.659
It felt amazing.

411
00:26:23.659 --> 00:26:26.326
I felt like I was glowing.

412
00:26:27.826 --> 00:26:32.118
I could hear and see
and feel everything.

413
00:26:33.326 --> 00:26:35.534
But I was in the passenger seat.

414
00:26:37.826 --> 00:26:39.534
It felt incredible.

415
00:26:41.409 --> 00:26:42.659
Mm.

416
00:26:45.951 --> 00:26:48.034
How did your mum die?

417
00:26:51.784 --> 00:26:53.284
You know.

418
00:26:54.284 --> 00:26:55.909
Only bits.

419
00:27:00.868 --> 00:27:02.368
She...

420
00:27:04.451 --> 00:27:06.825
took too many sleeping pills.

421
00:27:06.826 --> 00:27:08.409
By accident.

422
00:27:11.368 --> 00:27:14.118
Dad was sleeping on the couch.

423
00:27:15.493 --> 00:27:17.868
In the morning, he
couldn't open the door.

424
00:27:20.368 --> 00:27:21.618
Mm.

425
00:27:23.159 --> 00:27:24.659
Why?

426
00:27:26.493 --> 00:27:28.868
Mum was on the other side.

427
00:27:31.326 --> 00:27:33.117
And there were
scratches on the door

428
00:27:33.118 --> 00:27:34.951
and wood under her nails.

429
00:27:37.284 --> 00:27:39.576
She tried to get help,
but she couldn't.

430
00:27:44.534 --> 00:27:47.784
Jade said you got
depression after.

431
00:27:51.159 --> 00:27:52.993
I was just feeling alone.

432
00:27:54.743 --> 00:27:56.492
No, you can't ever be alone

433
00:27:56.493 --> 00:27:58.576
'cause you'll always
have me and Jade.

434
00:28:00.076 --> 00:28:01.409
Yeah.

435
00:28:02.534 --> 00:28:04.993
It's OK, I don't
feel alone anymore.

436
00:28:23.784 --> 00:28:25.950
<i>Wait. Oh, my God...</i>

437
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:28.242
<i>- Is it being constipated?
- Are you fuckin'...?</i>

438
00:28:28.243 --> 00:28:30.659
<i>He's won a million pounds!</i>

439
00:29:01.159 --> 00:29:04.117
- You busy tonight?
- You want a turn, eh?

440
00:29:04.118 --> 00:29:06.575
No. Daniel does.

441
00:29:06.576 --> 00:29:08.284
What's in it for me?

442
00:29:09.326 --> 00:29:10.867
My company.

443
00:29:10.868 --> 00:29:12.700
That's pretty cool, I reckon.

444
00:29:12.701 --> 00:29:15.742
No, we can't go to Joss's. His
place is trashed. He's pissed.

445
00:29:15.743 --> 00:29:17.658
My house, then.

446
00:29:17.659 --> 00:29:19.950
I got a party later.
I've gotta be gone by 11.

447
00:29:19.951 --> 00:29:22.451
Mum, leaves at 9,
so... See ya at 10.

448
00:29:24.243 --> 00:29:25.743
Jog on.

449
00:29:32.284 --> 00:29:33.701
Yeah? Yes!

450
00:29:36.993 --> 00:29:39.284
Hi. Is Jade home?

451
00:29:46.243 --> 00:29:48.908
- Why is Daniel at the door?
- Mum, can you let him in?

452
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:51.783
You'd better not be having a
party, Jade, I swear to God.

453
00:29:51.784 --> 00:29:53.826
It's two friends.
Can you let him in?

454
00:29:59.243 --> 00:30:00.908
What time's everyone
getting here?

455
00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:03.617
- Getting here for what?
- The party.

456
00:30:03.618 --> 00:30:06.325
- Is there a party tonight?
- Don't bullshit me.

457
00:30:06.326 --> 00:30:07.658
I'm... I'm sorry...

458
00:30:07.659 --> 00:30:09.367
Have you got
alcohol in your car?

459
00:30:09.368 --> 00:30:11.783
Oh, no. I don't drink, so...

460
00:30:11.784 --> 00:30:13.701
You're good.

461
00:30:20.284 --> 00:30:21.992
What time's the party again?

462
00:30:21.993 --> 00:30:23.617
What party? The party.

463
00:30:23.618 --> 00:30:25.283
Jade told me. It's
OK. What time?

464
00:30:25.284 --> 00:30:27.575
I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

465
00:30:27.576 --> 00:30:29.283
The party tonight.
What time is it?

466
00:30:29.284 --> 00:30:30.784
There's no party, Mum.

467
00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:34.700
You are not drinking tonight.

468
00:30:34.701 --> 00:30:37.242
On God, I will punch
you in the face.

469
00:30:37.243 --> 00:30:38.783
Are you drunk?

470
00:30:38.784 --> 00:30:39.908
James.

471
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:42.368
If there's a party, I'm
definitely drinking at it.

472
00:30:44.159 --> 00:30:46.951
Is that Cookie or you, James?
Will you crack a window?

473
00:30:50.284 --> 00:30:51.825
Jesus, Mum. Knock much?

474
00:30:51.826 --> 00:30:53.825
Mia, if there is
a party tonight,

475
00:30:53.826 --> 00:30:56.618
you are banned from this
house, effective immediately.

476
00:30:58.243 --> 00:30:59.909
OK...

477
00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:03.450
So, you're just third-wheeling
for the night, are you?

478
00:31:03.451 --> 00:31:05.950
It's really humiliating
when you put it that way.

479
00:31:05.951 --> 00:31:08.700
You'd better not be
getting stoned again, Mia.

480
00:31:08.701 --> 00:31:11.408
Oh, my God! Why does your
mum have to know everything?

481
00:31:11.409 --> 00:31:14.408
I know everything.
- I tried weed one time.

482
00:31:14.409 --> 00:31:15.533
You.

483
00:31:15.534 --> 00:31:17.325
My daughter's
vagina - prohibited.

484
00:31:17.326 --> 00:31:20.242
Oh, my God, Mum! Leave the
room before I kill everyone.

485
00:31:20.243 --> 00:31:22.242
The neighbours
tell me everything.

486
00:31:22.243 --> 00:31:23.950
Oh, my God...
- Watch it!

487
00:31:23.951 --> 00:31:25.700
Shut the door. Mum!

488
00:31:25.701 --> 00:31:27.492
I'm leaving it open!

489
00:31:27.493 --> 00:31:29.117
I'm so sorry.

490
00:31:29.118 --> 00:31:30.617
Ooh. That's embarrassing.

491
00:31:30.618 --> 00:31:33.492

Mia!
- Mm! You keen?

498
00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:47.825
I said don't smoke in my house.

499
00:31:47.826 --> 00:31:49.076
Mm!

500
00:31:52.326 --> 00:31:54.783
Hmm... Nice place.

501
00:31:54.784 --> 00:31:57.033
That's an ugly fuckin' dog.

502
00:31:57.034 --> 00:31:58.451
Excuse me.

503
00:31:59.826 --> 00:32:01.451
- I'm thirsty.

504
00:32:15.576 --> 00:32:17.450
So, where'd you get
it from, anyway?

505
00:32:17.451 --> 00:32:19.367
I'll tell you what it is, right?

506
00:32:19.368 --> 00:32:22.825
It's the hand of a psychic. Got
cut off and embalmed. Legit.

507
00:32:22.826 --> 00:32:24.825
A medium, Joss. Not a psychic.

508
00:32:24.826 --> 00:32:26.700
Yeah, this isn't
an embalmed hand.

509
00:32:26.701 --> 00:32:30.367
Yes, it is, Danny boy. The
ceramic shit is put over it.

510
00:32:30.368 --> 00:32:33.117
But if you smash it, there's
an actual hand in there.

511
00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:35.033
- You're full of shit.
- I'm serious.

512
00:32:35.034 --> 00:32:36.825
Apparently it was
the hand of someone

513
00:32:36.826 --> 00:32:38.492
who could connect with the dead,

514
00:32:38.493 --> 00:32:41.117
so everyone around him thought,
let's cut his hand off.

515
00:32:41.118 --> 00:32:43.200
White people shit,
man, I tell ya.

516
00:32:43.201 --> 00:32:45.533
Oi, I heard it was the
hand of a Satanist.

517
00:32:45.534 --> 00:32:48.825
The other hand's just
out there somewhere.

518
00:32:48.826 --> 00:32:50.325
Out where?

519
00:32:50.326 --> 00:32:51.950
Shut up, alright?

520
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:54.575
- Fuckin' make me!
- You just talk shit.

521
00:32:54.576 --> 00:32:56.242
Alright.

522
00:32:56.243 --> 00:32:58.992
Where'd you buy it? Oh,
nah, I didn't buy it.

523
00:32:58.993 --> 00:33:01.075
A friend gave it to
a friend and... yeah.

524
00:33:01.076 --> 00:33:03.367
- Who?
- What do you want, Daniel?

525
00:33:03.368 --> 00:33:06.200
A fuckin' spreadsheet with a
transaction history or what?

526
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:07.825
Hold the hand, say "Talk to me"

527
00:33:07.826 --> 00:33:10.408
and ask the spirit your
fuckin' questions, alright?

528
00:33:10.409 --> 00:33:12.075
This is such bullshit.

529
00:33:12.076 --> 00:33:13.868
Oi, Riley, get the lights.

530
00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:17.617
Film me?

531
00:33:17.618 --> 00:33:19.784
Yep.
- Oi, time it.

532
00:33:21.034 --> 00:33:23.618
OK, champ.

533
00:33:24.701 --> 00:33:26.201
You know the drill.

534
00:33:28.534 --> 00:33:30.451
- Say it.

535
00:33:34.326 --> 00:33:35.867
Talk to me.

536
00:33:35.868 --> 00:33:37.283
Whoa!

537
00:33:37.284 --> 00:33:39.200
Oh, what?!

538
00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:40.950
- No way!

539
00:33:40.951 --> 00:33:43.158
- Mate, I don't have all day.
- No. No...

540
00:33:43.159 --> 00:33:44.784
What is it?

541
00:33:46.243 --> 00:33:48.033
OK. OK.

542
00:33:48.034 --> 00:33:49.783
OK.

543
00:33:49.784 --> 00:33:51.450
OK, come on.

544
00:33:51.451 --> 00:33:53.034
OK, come on.

545
00:33:57.743 --> 00:33:59.451
I let you in.

546
00:34:07.034 --> 00:34:08.575
Hayley, he's choking.

547
00:34:08.576 --> 00:34:10.534
Hold it.

548
00:34:12.201 --> 00:34:14.367
Hayley, fucking stop
it, he's choking!

549
00:34:14.368 --> 00:34:15.618
Hold it.

550
00:34:21.034 --> 00:34:23.118
There we go.

551
00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:37.951
He hates it when you touch him.

552
00:34:41.284 --> 00:34:43.534
You make him soft.

553
00:34:47.868 --> 00:34:50.076
Yo, this spirit's a cunt.

554
00:35:20.034 --> 00:35:21.992
Oh, fuck!

555
00:35:21.993 --> 00:35:23.451
Oh, shit.

556
00:35:37.159 --> 00:35:39.118
Ohhh!

557
00:35:41.409 --> 00:35:45.034
Oh, no! I can't watch!

558
00:35:56.451 --> 00:35:57.908
Oh, fuck! You OK?

559
00:35:57.909 --> 00:35:59.658
Untie me.

560
00:35:59.659 --> 00:36:02.283
Untie me, come on.

561
00:36:02.284 --> 00:36:03.951
You alright?

562
00:36:05.118 --> 00:36:06.700
Delete it.

563
00:36:06.701 --> 00:36:08.783
Delete it, come on!

564
00:36:08.784 --> 00:36:10.075

Can I have a go?

572
00:36:33.076 --> 00:36:35.326
Sorry...

No way. Come on, Jade.

591
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.575
You're not my mum.
You're not even 18.

592
00:38:25.576 --> 00:38:27.617
You're not even 15. So what?

593
00:38:27.618 --> 00:38:30.493
Jade, please.
- Riley, I said no.

00:38:33.576 --> 00:38:35.533
Fuck sakes.

595
00:38:35.534 --> 00:38:38.617
What if we did it
for, like, 60 seconds?

596
00:38:38.618 --> 00:38:41.242
- Mia, stop.
- 60 seconds, Jade.

597
00:38:41.243 --> 00:38:44.075
You don't have to be a bitch
about all things Riley.

598
00:38:44.076 --> 00:38:47.117
Yeah, Jade. You're just so busy
trying to suck Daniel's dick,

599
00:38:47.118 --> 00:38:49.242
you don't give a shit
about anybody else.

600
00:38:49.243 --> 00:38:53.325
OK, no. Why do you want to do
it so much? To impress James?

601
00:38:53.326 --> 00:38:55.617
To come into my room
crying that you're scared

602
00:38:55.618 --> 00:38:56.826
like last time?

603
00:38:57.826 --> 00:38:59.576
Did you tell your
little friend that?

604
00:39:01.701 --> 00:39:03.326
I hate you.

605
00:39:04.368 --> 00:39:06.534
Like you're my favourite
person in the world.

606
00:39:09.993 --> 00:39:13.034
Can't help you, bro. Your
sister's fuckin' boring.

607
00:39:17.993 --> 00:39:19.534
Oh, shit, ooh...

608
00:39:22.243 --> 00:39:23.533
- We should go.
- Yeah.

609
00:39:23.534 --> 00:39:25.992
- 60 seconds. Please.

610
00:39:25.993 --> 00:39:28.700
I dunno, maybe it's
not a good idea.

611
00:39:28.701 --> 00:39:31.992
I actually thought you were
gonna be on my side for once.

612
00:39:31.993 --> 00:39:34.242
Hey... I'm on both
of your sides.

613
00:39:34.243 --> 00:39:35.908
- Obviously not.
- Riley...

614
00:39:35.909 --> 00:39:37.618
60 seconds. Please.

615
00:39:42.701 --> 00:39:43.868
Please.

616
00:39:44.868 --> 00:39:46.783
OK.

617
00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:48.242
What about 50?

618
00:39:48.243 --> 00:39:49.493
OK. 50.

619
00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:52.159
50 seconds?

620
00:39:53.701 --> 00:39:56.242
- Yeah, just get it over with.
- Sign the form, baby!

621
00:39:56.243 --> 00:39:58.158
- Let's go!
- Yeah, boy!

622
00:39:58.159 --> 00:39:59.868
OK, hold up, hold up.

623
00:40:01.826 --> 00:40:03.575
Hands up.

624
00:40:03.576 --> 00:40:05.200
You alright, kiddo?

625
00:40:05.201 --> 00:40:06.575
Yep.

626
00:40:06.576 --> 00:40:08.950
OK. Let's do this.

627
00:40:08.951 --> 00:40:12.576
Riley... gettin' crazy!

628
00:40:13.951 --> 00:40:15.451
You know what to say, boy.

629
00:40:20.701 --> 00:40:22.450
You better not cry
after 20 seconds.

630
00:40:22.451 --> 00:40:23.743
I'll time it.

631
00:40:26.576 --> 00:40:28.118
Talk to me.

632
00:40:32.451 --> 00:40:34.034
What the fuck?

633
00:40:36.368 --> 00:40:37.533
Riley.

634
00:40:37.534 --> 00:40:39.201
It's OK.

635
00:40:41.493 --> 00:40:42.993
Just say it.

636
00:40:52.326 --> 00:40:53.868
I let you in.

637
00:40:56.993 --> 00:40:58.701
Oh, shit.

638
00:41:12.034 --> 00:41:14.243
I'm so sorry.

639
00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:21.118
I didn't mean to hurt you.

640
00:41:26.243 --> 00:41:28.576
I'd never want to hurt you.

641
00:41:29.784 --> 00:41:32.617
I miss you so...

642
00:41:32.618 --> 00:41:34.659
so much, Mi.

643
00:41:39.993 --> 00:41:42.743
I don't want you to hate me.

644
00:41:45.118 --> 00:41:46.201
Mum?

645
00:41:47.618 --> 00:41:50.200
- Hey, that's 50 seconds.
- Please don't close it off.

646
00:41:50.201 --> 00:41:52.076
Mia...
- It's my mum. Please.

647
00:41:53.909 --> 00:41:56.284
I love you both, baby.

648
00:41:58.493 --> 00:42:00.242
I love you too, Mum.

649
00:42:00.243 --> 00:42:03.618
I'm so proud of you.

650
00:42:07.784 --> 00:42:09.617
And I got...

651
00:42:09.618 --> 00:42:12.533
got... got... got...

652
00:42:12.534 --> 00:42:15.575

655
00:42:32.659 --> 00:42:34.451
Oh, my God.

656
00:42:39.284 --> 00:42:41.700
No! No, no, Riley!

657
00:42:41.701 --> 00:42:43.868
- Riley, stop!

658
00:42:45.034 --> 00:42:46.992
Joss, fucking help me!

659
00:42:46.993 --> 00:42:48.618
Get it off him, Joss!

660
00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:54.243
Oh, my God.

661
00:43:00.243 --> 00:43:01.993
Riley! Riley!

662
00:43:04.868 --> 00:43:06.492
Fucking help me!

663
00:43:06.493 --> 00:43:08.367
Oi, help, help, help!

664
00:43:08.368 --> 00:43:11.533
OK, I'm gonna untie him...
Get him on his side...

665
00:43:11.534 --> 00:43:13.283
Daniel, call an ambulance!

666
00:43:13.284 --> 00:43:15.243
No, no, no, no, no, no...!

667
00:43:21.451 --> 00:43:23.993
James, James, get the
fuckin' bag! Hurry up!

668
00:43:34.201 --> 00:43:36.408
Where are you going?
We gotta bounce.

669
00:43:36.409 --> 00:43:37.533
No, we can't bounce.

670
00:43:37.534 --> 00:43:38.950
We've gotta get out of here.

671
00:43:38.951 --> 00:43:40.492
The police are already suss
about the Duckett stabbing.

672
00:43:40.493 --> 00:43:42.367
They're gonna pin this on us.
We let them both do the hand.

673
00:43:42.368 --> 00:43:43.992
We can't just pretend
we weren't here.

674
00:43:43.993 --> 00:43:46.158
We're fucked...
We're fucked if...

675
00:43:46.159 --> 00:43:47.908
We just gotta get
our story straight

676
00:43:47.909 --> 00:43:51.409
and make sure everyone sticks
to it. Don't bring up the hand.

677
00:44:31.034 --> 00:44:33.493
Excuse me. We need
to talk now, please.

678
00:44:42.659 --> 00:44:44.825
<i>Mum, Riley's in hospital.</i>

679
00:44:44.826 --> 00:44:46.450
<i>What? What happened?</i>

680
00:44:46.451 --> 00:44:48.242
<i>He smashed his face really bad.</i>

681
00:44:48.243 --> 00:44:51.075
<i>What are you talking about,
"smashed his face"? How?</i>

682
00:44:51.076 --> 00:44:52.742
<i>I don't know. I don't know.</i>

683
00:44:52.743 --> 00:44:54.450
<i>I don't know, I
wasn't in the room!</i>

684
00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:57.033
<i>Stop crying and tell
me what happened.</i>

685
00:44:57.034 --> 00:44:59.992
Three or four minutes,
maybe? <i>I'm sorry, Mum.</i>

686
00:44:59.993 --> 00:45:02.826
<i>Jade! Jade,
frickin' answer me!</i>

687
00:45:17.076 --> 00:45:19.283
Can we talk about this?

688
00:45:19.284 --> 00:45:20.825
Mia.

689
00:45:20.826 --> 00:45:22.784
Dad, I just want to go to sleep.

690
00:45:23.909 --> 00:45:25.659
Can you tell me one thing?

691
00:45:26.868 --> 00:45:28.992
We didn't give him anything.

692
00:45:28.993 --> 00:45:30.743
What happened, then?

693
00:45:32.701 --> 00:45:34.201
I dunno.

694
00:45:35.576 --> 00:45:37.659
I wish you'd just
be honest with me.

695
00:45:38.784 --> 00:45:41.576
Right, because you've
been so honest with me.

696
00:45:42.743 --> 00:45:45.033
What's that supposed to mean?

697
00:45:45.034 --> 00:45:48.408
It means there's something
you haven't told me about Mum.

698
00:45:48.409 --> 00:45:49.993
Isn't there?

699
00:45:55.451 --> 00:45:56.951
Right.

700
00:47:09.284 --> 00:47:10.825
Tell me he's OK.

701
00:47:10.826 --> 00:47:12.950
No offence, I don't
want you here right now.

702
00:47:12.951 --> 00:47:15.409
Wait, Jade. Come on.

703
00:47:18.159 --> 00:47:19.326
Mia.

704
00:47:28.326 --> 00:47:29.408
Sue, I...

705
00:47:29.409 --> 00:47:30.576
Don't!

706
00:47:32.618 --> 00:47:34.367
What are you doing here?

707
00:47:34.368 --> 00:47:36.992
I just... I just came
to see how he was.

708
00:47:36.993 --> 00:47:39.700
He's bad, Mia. He's
really fucking bad.

709
00:47:39.701 --> 00:47:42.283
- Did you give him something?
- No.

710
00:47:42.284 --> 00:47:44.950
Come on. I know you've done
shit before. What was it?

711
00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:46.576
Nothing, I swear.

712
00:47:47.784 --> 00:47:49.742
Look at his face.

713
00:47:49.743 --> 00:47:52.034
What did my son ever do to you?

714
00:47:53.243 --> 00:47:54.783
I... I didn't hurt him.

715
00:47:54.784 --> 00:47:56.408
Go home. Now.

716
00:47:56.409 --> 00:47:58.033
No, please, can I just see him?

717
00:47:58.034 --> 00:48:00.408
You come back here, I'm
gonna call the police.

718
00:48:00.409 --> 00:48:01.993
Sue...

719
00:48:04.118 --> 00:48:06.158
- Jade.
- Just go home.

720
00:48:06.159 --> 00:48:08.243
No, Jade, I'm so sorry...

721
00:49:28.368 --> 00:49:29.659
Mum?

722
00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:32.618
Mum, is that you?

723
00:49:33.826 --> 00:49:35.783
Help me!
- Mum?

724
00:49:35.784 --> 00:49:39.408
Mum?

725
00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:41.909
Mum! Mia!

726
00:49:58.618 --> 00:49:59.742
Mia.

727
00:49:59.743 --> 00:50:01.493
- What's wrong?

728
00:50:04.951 --> 00:50:06.534
Are you OK?

729
00:50:29.618 --> 00:50:31.118
Was your dad pissed?

730
00:50:32.534 --> 00:50:33.658
Yeah.

731
00:50:33.659 --> 00:50:36.909
I'm 18, so the police
didn't call mine.

732
00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:39.743
They can't know.

733
00:50:42.159 --> 00:50:43.826
Where do they think you are?

734
00:50:45.284 --> 00:50:46.451
Cousin's.

735
00:50:48.034 --> 00:50:49.950
I can't go home.

736
00:50:49.951 --> 00:50:51.534
They'll know something's up.

737
00:50:54.826 --> 00:50:56.618
You can stay at mine.

738
00:51:07.118 --> 00:51:09.117
Just 'cause of me and Jade.

739
00:51:09.118 --> 00:51:11.325
It might be...

740
00:51:11.326 --> 00:51:13.283
weird.

741
00:51:13.284 --> 00:51:15.908
Yeah, but...

742
00:51:15.909 --> 00:51:17.533
we're just friends.

743
00:51:17.534 --> 00:51:19.576
It's not like it's
illegal or anything.

744
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:26.200
I just...

745
00:51:26.201 --> 00:51:28.034
I don't want to be alone.

746
00:51:31.826 --> 00:51:33.493
OK.

747
00:51:39.701 --> 00:51:42.200
I can't believe I spoke to her.

748
00:51:42.201 --> 00:51:44.450
I don't think that
was your mum, Mia.

749
00:51:44.451 --> 00:51:46.576
No, it was at first.

750
00:51:47.743 --> 00:51:49.575
She used to call me
'Mi' all the time.

751
00:51:49.576 --> 00:51:51.576
I mean, how would the
spirits know that?

752
00:51:52.868 --> 00:51:55.075
I feel like they read
what we think. You know?

753
00:51:55.076 --> 00:51:57.242
I mean...

754
00:51:57.243 --> 00:51:59.867
they were in us.

755
00:51:59.868 --> 00:52:01.826
They could know
everything about us.

756
00:52:04.534 --> 00:52:06.367
Or maybe...

757
00:52:06.368 --> 00:52:09.076
Mum was there because she
was trying to reach out.

758
00:52:14.118 --> 00:52:15.826
We could check.

759
00:52:16.993 --> 00:52:18.909
I'm never doing it again, Mia.

760
00:52:20.868 --> 00:52:22.368
Sorry.

761
00:52:31.493 --> 00:52:33.908
Forgot about that.

762
00:52:33.909 --> 00:52:37.075
- I was such a loser.
- You were cute.

763
00:52:37.076 --> 00:52:39.200
Remember when we held hands?

764
00:52:39.201 --> 00:52:41.158
Yeah.

765
00:52:41.159 --> 00:52:44.033
I could feel your heart beating
through your fingertips.

766
00:52:44.034 --> 00:52:46.825
You paid me out 'cause your
hands were bigger than mine.

767
00:52:46.826 --> 00:52:49.284
- And they probably still are.
- No way.

768
00:52:53.951 --> 00:52:57.450
It is. You have
the tiniest hands.

769
00:52:57.451 --> 00:53:00.326
Yeah, I... I didn't
do puberty right.

770
00:54:16.868 --> 00:54:18.743
<i>No, wait, Jade...</i>

771
00:54:36.951 --> 00:54:38.575
<i>Mum.</i>

772
00:54:38.576 --> 00:54:40.659
<i>What's your message
to the haters?</i>

773
00:54:41.743 --> 00:54:44.617
<i>Suck my arse! Mm-hm!</i>

774
00:54:44.618 --> 00:54:46.283
<i>Mum!</i>

775
00:54:46.284 --> 00:54:48.784
<i>Get off me. Get off!</i>

776
00:54:51.493 --> 00:54:52.867
<i>Who's the cutest?</i>

777
00:54:52.868 --> 00:54:54.658
<i>Me. Me.
- Me.</i>

778
00:54:54.659 --> 00:54:56.783
<i>- Who's the hottest?
- Me.</i>

779
00:54:56.784 --> 00:54:58.825
<i>Who's the best? Me!</i>

780
00:54:58.826 --> 00:55:00.992
<i>Who's the funniest? Me.</i>

781
00:55:00.993 --> 00:55:02.492
<i>You suck!</i>

782
00:55:02.493 --> 00:55:03.950
<i>You suck!</i>

783
00:55:03.951 --> 00:55:06.076
<i>- Fuck the haters!</i>

784
00:57:05.743 --> 00:57:08.075
Please... No. No, Rhea...

785
00:57:08.076 --> 00:57:10.409
Rhea...

786
00:58:39.743 --> 00:58:41.243
Daniel?

787
00:58:44.784 --> 00:58:47.909
Daniel! Daniel, wake up!

788
00:58:49.118 --> 00:58:51.325
Daniel, wake up!

789
00:58:51.326 --> 00:58:54.283
Daniel!

790
00:58:54.284 --> 00:58:56.826
Wake up!

791
00:58:58.743 --> 00:59:00.867
Oh, what the...?! Mia!

792
00:59:00.868 --> 00:59:02.368
- Stop!

793
00:59:04.243 --> 00:59:07.326
Where is she? Oh,
my God, oh, my God!

794
00:59:08.993 --> 00:59:10.367
Oh, my God, they followed us.

795
00:59:10.368 --> 00:59:11.867
Whoever we contacted,
they followed us.

796
00:59:11.868 --> 00:59:14.533
- What are you talking about?
- She was sucking your foot!

797
00:59:14.534 --> 00:59:17.367
- You had my foot in your mouth!
- What? No, I didn't.

798
00:59:17.368 --> 00:59:19.075
- I'm gonna go.
- Wait, Daniel...

799
00:59:19.076 --> 00:59:20.825
- Mia, stop!
- No, don't leave me!

800
00:59:20.826 --> 00:59:22.701
- No, I'm going.
- Stay with me.

801
01:00:16.659 --> 01:00:18.659
Mum?

802
01:00:20.118 --> 01:00:22.368
Mum.

803
01:00:25.868 --> 01:00:28.159
Please, please, Mum.

804
01:00:30.034 --> 01:00:31.534
Talk to me.

805
01:00:42.868 --> 01:00:44.618
Mum.

806
01:00:55.909 --> 01:00:58.742
Did you...

807
01:00:58.743 --> 01:01:00.826
Did you kill yourself?

808
01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:04.950
No.

809
01:01:04.951 --> 01:01:07.243
Not on purpose, Mi.

810
01:01:09.326 --> 01:01:11.243
Is that the truth?

811
01:01:12.534 --> 01:01:15.617
I'd never want to leave you.

812
01:01:15.618 --> 01:01:17.409
Ever.

813
01:01:19.451 --> 01:01:21.409
I'm here.

814
01:01:22.618 --> 01:01:24.118
Always.

815
01:01:32.701 --> 01:01:34.493
Mia.

816
01:01:36.118 --> 01:01:38.493
Riley needs help.

817
01:02:36.201 --> 01:02:39.158
Oh, your father. Unbelievable.

818
01:02:39.159 --> 01:02:41.493
Can you stay with him, Jade?

819
01:02:54.618 --> 01:02:56.201
Riley.

820
01:02:57.951 --> 01:03:00.243
Riley, please say something.

821
01:03:04.368 --> 01:03:05.993
Riley?

822
01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:08.951
Riley.

823
01:03:18.201 --> 01:03:19.658
Mum! Mum!

824
01:03:19.659 --> 01:03:22.701
No, Riley, stop! Riley, stop!

825
01:03:24.326 --> 01:03:26.368
Stop! Stop!

826
01:03:30.034 --> 01:03:31.783
Stop!

827
01:03:31.784 --> 01:03:33.409
Stop!

828
01:03:40.576 --> 01:03:42.408
Riley!

829
01:03:42.409 --> 01:03:44.242
Oh, shit!

830
01:03:44.243 --> 01:03:47.618
Stop! Nurse!

831
01:03:49.368 --> 01:03:51.451
Please stop him!
Please stop him!

832
01:03:55.826 --> 01:03:59.909
Riley, fucking stop now!
Fucking stop him! Do something!

833
01:04:05.618 --> 01:04:08.742
It was you who took it. You
could've said something, Mia.

834
01:04:08.743 --> 01:04:10.408
Who showed the police the video?

835
01:04:10.409 --> 01:04:11.950
Think it was James.

836
01:04:11.951 --> 01:04:14.075
Least it proves we
didn't touch him.

837
01:04:14.076 --> 01:04:16.033
Police said there's
not a lot they can do.

838
01:04:16.034 --> 01:04:17.783
Has it ever lasted this long?

839
01:04:17.784 --> 01:04:18.908
No.

840
01:04:18.909 --> 01:04:21.408
But we've never been over
90 seconds before Mia, so...

841
01:04:21.409 --> 01:04:23.493
How is he?

842
01:04:24.743 --> 01:04:27.159
Every time he comes to,
he tries to kill himself.

843
01:04:28.368 --> 01:04:30.783
They wanna keep him. What?

844
01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:32.575
The guy who gave
Duckett the hand said

845
01:04:32.576 --> 01:04:35.617
that if you die while they're
in you, they have you forever.

846
01:04:35.618 --> 01:04:39.451
Have any of you guys...
still been seeing stuff?

847
01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:42.950
What the fuck you
mean, "seeing stuff"?

848
01:04:42.951 --> 01:04:45.076
I saw my mum at the hospital.

849
01:04:46.784 --> 01:04:49.534
And another one attacked
Daniel at my house.

850
01:04:50.534 --> 01:04:53.742
Did you see something?
Uh... not exactly.

851
01:04:53.743 --> 01:04:55.908
What's that supposed
to mean, Daniel?

852
01:04:55.909 --> 01:04:59.076
I woke up and Mia was...

853
01:05:00.868 --> 01:05:02.368
I dunno...

854
01:05:03.493 --> 01:05:05.117
sucking my feet.

855
01:05:05.118 --> 01:05:06.618
The fuck?

856
01:05:07.618 --> 01:05:08.658
Jade.

857
01:05:08.659 --> 01:05:10.492
What do you mean,
"woke up with Mia"?

858
01:05:10.493 --> 01:05:12.283
What do you mean,
"sucking your feet"?

859
01:05:12.284 --> 01:05:14.158
It wasn't me.
- I couldn't go home.

860
01:05:14.159 --> 01:05:16.325
None of us have
been seeing shit.

861
01:05:16.326 --> 01:05:17.867
We all did it. We
were all there.

862
01:05:17.868 --> 01:05:20.492
Why would you see your mum?
You didn't even let her in.

863
01:05:20.493 --> 01:05:23.325
Wait, didn't Duckett say
they could imitate people?

864
01:05:23.326 --> 01:05:25.034
Wait, who's Duckett?

865
01:05:26.534 --> 01:05:28.700
I got the hand
off him. He, uh...

866
01:05:28.701 --> 01:05:31.617
I met him twice at
some parties and...

867
01:05:31.618 --> 01:05:34.492
yeah, we did the hand shit,
I asked if I could borrow it

868
01:05:34.493 --> 01:05:36.284
and he said I could keep it.

869
01:05:39.243 --> 01:05:41.034
He said he was seeing
them without it.

870
01:05:42.076 --> 01:05:43.950
And then he went full skitz.

871
01:05:43.951 --> 01:05:46.950
Stabbed his brother,
then killed himself.

872
01:05:46.951 --> 01:05:49.826
The brother. Can
we talk to him?

873
01:05:59.034 --> 01:06:01.117
What's up, bruz?

874
01:06:01.118 --> 01:06:03.033
What are you doing here?

875
01:06:03.034 --> 01:06:04.743
We gotta talk about Duckett.

876
01:06:06.493 --> 01:06:07.993
Yeah.

877
01:06:09.076 --> 01:06:11.242
Do you know what
the shit thing is?

878
01:06:11.243 --> 01:06:13.242
He actually thought
he had friends.

879
01:06:13.243 --> 01:06:15.117
You guys always
inviting him to shit,

880
01:06:15.118 --> 01:06:16.950
acting like you cared.

881
01:06:16.951 --> 01:06:19.575
- But you were using him.
- We weren't using him, Cole.

882
01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:21.825
A real friend would've
seen it was fucking him up.

883
01:06:21.826 --> 01:06:23.283
- But you didn't.

884
01:06:23.284 --> 01:06:25.742
Look, bruz, I know it's
a shit time for you,

885
01:06:25.743 --> 01:06:27.367
but we need your help.

886
01:06:27.368 --> 01:06:29.242
Nah, man, I'm out.

887
01:06:29.243 --> 01:06:30.618
Cole.

888
01:07:05.576 --> 01:07:09.243
I know how much it hurts
to lose someone that close.

889
01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:21.493
The people he let in
messed up his head.

890
01:07:22.493 --> 01:07:24.283
If he'd stopped doing
that fucking thing,

891
01:07:24.284 --> 01:07:25.533
they would've left.

892
01:07:25.534 --> 01:07:29.117
My little brother's in
hospital. He went way over.

893
01:07:29.118 --> 01:07:30.826
You let a kid do it?

894
01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:36.283
His body should kick 'em out.

895
01:07:36.284 --> 01:07:38.200
They get weaker the
longer they're in.

896
01:07:38.201 --> 01:07:39.908
It hasn't. Give it time.

897
01:07:39.909 --> 01:07:41.201
They're killing him.

898
01:07:42.201 --> 01:07:43.325
Maybe it's time

899
01:07:43.326 --> 01:07:45.325
you stop fucking up
people's lives, Joss.

900
01:07:45.326 --> 01:07:47.201
What do you reckon?

901
01:07:53.618 --> 01:07:54.658
Jade!

902
01:07:54.659 --> 01:07:56.658
Jade, just wait! Jade!

903
01:07:56.659 --> 01:07:58.575
You shouldn't have
let him do it, Mia!

904
01:07:58.576 --> 01:08:00.158
We all decided it'd be OK.

905
01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:01.825
We didn't decide anything.

906
01:08:01.826 --> 01:08:03.158
We did. We all said...

907
01:08:03.159 --> 01:08:04.950
We didn't say shit,
Mia. That was you.

908
01:08:04.951 --> 01:08:06.783
You let it go for
two fucking minutes.

909
01:08:06.784 --> 01:08:09.533
You sleep with my boyfriend.
What the fuck's wrong with you?

910
01:08:09.534 --> 01:08:12.409
- Jade, it wasn't like that.
- Of course you take her side.

911
01:08:14.243 --> 01:08:15.576
Jesus...

912
01:08:17.868 --> 01:08:22.409
I wish that you didn't force
yourself into my family, Mia.

913
01:08:26.034 --> 01:08:27.534
Um...

914
01:08:29.701 --> 01:08:31.825
Did we blow the candle out?

915
01:08:31.826 --> 01:08:33.409
I don't remember.

916
01:08:34.409 --> 01:08:36.742
What if we opened the door
but we didn't shut it?

917
01:08:36.743 --> 01:08:38.325
What are you saying?

918
01:08:38.326 --> 01:08:41.075
We do it again with Riley but
blow out the candle this time.

919
01:08:41.076 --> 01:08:42.533
You want him to do it again?

920
01:08:42.534 --> 01:08:43.783
The thing that put
him in hospital?

921
01:08:43.784 --> 01:08:45.783
- You wanna save him?
- Don't fucking ask me that.

922
01:08:45.784 --> 01:08:47.368
We have to do something, Jade!

923
01:09:00.076 --> 01:09:01.867
I'll give it back after, OK?

924
01:09:01.868 --> 01:09:03.659
Just burn the fuckin' thing.

925
01:09:04.743 --> 01:09:06.576
Hey, good luck.

926
01:09:29.034 --> 01:09:30.908
Mum's back in, like, an hour.

927
01:09:30.909 --> 01:09:32.159
We'll be quick.

928
01:09:50.743 --> 01:09:52.368
Oh, my God.

929
01:10:08.701 --> 01:10:10.618
Come on, Riley.
Come on, please.

930
01:10:19.284 --> 01:10:20.951
Talk to him.

931
01:10:26.159 --> 01:10:27.409
OK, yeah, blow it out.

932
01:10:30.201 --> 01:10:31.368
Anything?

933
01:10:32.368 --> 01:10:34.700
I don't know. Um...

934
01:10:34.701 --> 01:10:36.325
Maybe if we just try it again.

935
01:10:36.326 --> 01:10:37.993
Mia...
- Just try it again.

936
01:10:45.243 --> 01:10:46.743
Talk to him.

937
01:10:49.951 --> 01:10:52.200
It's not working.

938
01:10:52.201 --> 01:10:54.159
OK. Um...

939
01:10:56.701 --> 01:10:58.617
What if I use the
hand to speak to him?

940
01:10:58.618 --> 01:11:00.533
No.
- What? He's not dead, Mi.

941
01:11:00.534 --> 01:11:03.117
But what if his spirit is
disconnected from his body?

942
01:11:03.118 --> 01:11:04.825
I thought these
spirits were in limbo.

943
01:11:04.826 --> 01:11:07.367
- Maybe that's where Riley is.
- Might not be him.

944
01:11:07.368 --> 01:11:09.117
- What if it is?
- What if it isn't?

945
01:11:09.118 --> 01:11:10.783
This is a bad idea, Mia.

946
01:11:10.784 --> 01:11:11.992
Mia.

947
01:11:11.993 --> 01:11:13.534
Mia, don't.

948
01:11:15.868 --> 01:11:18.826
Riley, talk to me.

949
01:11:26.951 --> 01:11:28.325
Hi.

950
01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:29.993
Is it him?

951
01:11:32.159 --> 01:11:34.076
Is there a boy here?

952
01:11:36.118 --> 01:11:37.451
Him.

953
01:11:39.576 --> 01:11:41.409
Do you know where he is?

954
01:11:44.909 --> 01:11:46.701
Please.

955
01:11:47.701 --> 01:11:49.409
I can take you to him.

956
01:11:50.493 --> 01:11:52.284
OK.

957
01:11:54.784 --> 01:11:56.451
I let you in.

958
01:12:04.201 --> 01:12:06.118
Help!

959
01:12:12.118 --> 01:12:14.450
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You OK?

960
01:12:14.451 --> 01:12:16.825
No! Don't touch me!

961
01:12:16.826 --> 01:12:18.908
Don't touch me!

962
01:12:18.909 --> 01:12:20.533
Hey, hey, hey.

963
01:12:20.534 --> 01:12:21.867
Hey.

964
01:12:21.868 --> 01:12:23.700
- It's just us.

965
01:12:23.701 --> 01:12:25.326
It's just me and Daniel.

966
01:12:26.659 --> 01:12:28.325
What happened?

967
01:12:28.326 --> 01:12:29.951
I saw him.

968
01:12:31.118 --> 01:12:32.951
They're hurting him, Jade.

969
01:12:34.159 --> 01:12:36.117
They're not gonna stop.

970
01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:38.534
They're never gonna stop.

971
01:12:59.701 --> 01:13:01.201
Mia.

972
01:13:04.534 --> 01:13:07.118
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

973
01:13:09.201 --> 01:13:10.951
But I want to be.

974
01:13:28.909 --> 01:13:30.908
Your mother...

975
01:13:30.909 --> 01:13:34.408
before she passed,
she left us something.

976
01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:36.408
Something I've been
scared to show you.

977
01:13:36.409 --> 01:13:38.200
Which is wrong of me.

978
01:13:38.201 --> 01:13:41.826
Because it's... it's just as
much as yours as it is mine.

979
01:13:44.576 --> 01:13:46.326
Can I read it to you?

980
01:14:04.409 --> 01:14:06.326
"Dear Max and Mia.

981
01:14:08.618 --> 01:14:10.992
"It's Tuesday today

982
01:14:10.993 --> 01:14:13.492
"and it's raining.

983
01:14:13.493 --> 01:14:17.283
"It's the first
time in a long time

984
01:14:17.284 --> 01:14:19.243
"I haven't felt hopeless.

985
01:14:22.493 --> 01:14:24.243
"In fact...

986
01:14:25.784 --> 01:14:28.368
"I am full of hope.

987
01:14:31.409 --> 01:14:35.742
"I hope you live
beyond your years

988
01:14:35.743 --> 01:14:38.368
"and find absolute happiness.

989
01:14:43.576 --> 01:14:46.284
"I hope you... I hope you
don't hate me for this."

990
01:14:47.659 --> 01:14:50.326
"I hope you find it in
your heart to forgive me.

991
01:14:52.076 --> 01:14:55.992
"I hope you can find
some peace in knowing

992
01:14:55.993 --> 01:14:58.159
"I am no longer in pain."

993
01:15:01.909 --> 01:15:03.951
I'm sorry, Mi.

994
01:15:06.993 --> 01:15:09.033
- It's hers, Mia.
- No.

995
01:15:09.034 --> 01:15:11.076
It's OK.

996
01:15:12.159 --> 01:15:13.825
No, she didn't do it.

997
01:15:13.826 --> 01:15:16.075
She didn't do it,
because she told me, Dad.

998
01:15:16.076 --> 01:15:18.409
She didn't do it,
because she told me.

999
01:15:19.618 --> 01:15:21.867
She told me. She told me.

1000
01:15:21.868 --> 01:15:23.700
- Mia.

1001
01:15:23.701 --> 01:15:25.783
Mia. Come here.

1002
01:15:25.784 --> 01:15:27.283
Sweetheart.

1003
01:15:27.284 --> 01:15:29.576
- She's gone.

1004
01:15:32.201 --> 01:15:34.451
I'm sorry I kept it from you.

1005
01:15:37.159 --> 01:15:39.743
I didn't want you
blaming yourself.

1006
01:15:46.868 --> 01:15:48.493
It's not true.

1007
01:15:59.951 --> 01:16:01.575
I'll be back.

1008
01:16:01.576 --> 01:16:03.159
What?

1009
01:16:05.034 --> 01:16:06.742
- I'll be back, I promise.
- Mi...

1010
01:16:06.743 --> 01:16:09.993
I promise. I just gotta... I'll
be back, Dad. I'll be back.

1011
01:16:13.618 --> 01:16:15.242
Mi.

1012
01:16:15.243 --> 01:16:17.492
He's lying.

1013
01:16:17.493 --> 01:16:20.075
Then why did you
write it? I didn't.

1014
01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.033
Sweetheart.

1015
01:16:22.034 --> 01:16:24.118
That's not your dad.

1016
01:16:25.659 --> 01:16:26.868
What?

1017
01:16:31.034 --> 01:16:32.701
Mia?

1018
01:16:33.993 --> 01:16:35.950
That's not Max.

1019
01:16:35.951 --> 01:16:37.450
Mia?

1020
01:16:37.451 --> 01:16:39.076
They're imitating him.

1021
01:16:42.576 --> 01:16:44.908
He's going to hurt you.

1022
01:16:44.909 --> 01:16:46.993
Mia, open the door!

1023
01:16:55.409 --> 01:16:58.200
Riley can't stay there.

1024
01:16:58.201 --> 01:17:00.617
Mia?
- He's suffering, Mi.

1025
01:17:00.618 --> 01:17:02.826
What... what do I do?

1026
01:17:04.618 --> 01:17:06.367
He needs to die.

1027
01:17:06.368 --> 01:17:07.867
What? Mia?

1028
01:17:07.868 --> 01:17:10.117
You have to put him
out of his misery.

1029
01:17:10.118 --> 01:17:12.325
No, Mum, I-I-I can't. I can't.

1030
01:17:12.326 --> 01:17:14.450
They're never gonna let him go.

1031
01:17:14.451 --> 01:17:17.075
- No, Mum, please, no...

1032
01:17:17.076 --> 01:17:18.700
I'll look after him, Mi.

1033
01:17:18.701 --> 01:17:20.825
Open the damn door!

1034
01:17:20.826 --> 01:17:22.783
Help him, Mia.

1035
01:17:22.784 --> 01:17:24.825
Let me in!

1036
01:17:24.826 --> 01:17:27.033
Help him, Mia!

1037
01:17:27.034 --> 01:17:28.618
Just leave me alone!

1038
01:18:00.784 --> 01:18:02.242
Mia!

1039
01:18:02.243 --> 01:18:04.451
- Mia!
- Help me!

1040
01:18:05.993 --> 01:18:07.534
I'm trying!

1041
01:18:17.451 --> 01:18:18.784
Mia!

1042
01:18:32.659 --> 01:18:34.659
- Oh, my God.

1043
01:19:20.493 --> 01:19:21.825
<i>Hey.</i>

1044
01:19:21.826 --> 01:19:23.700
Jade?

1045
01:19:23.701 --> 01:19:25.409
<i>You OK?</i>

1046
01:19:28.368 --> 01:19:29.951
I know what to do.

1047
01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:33.368
We can save him.

1048
01:19:34.993 --> 01:19:37.700
You know, I actually
think he's getting better.

1049
01:19:37.701 --> 01:19:39.575
He woke up for a second.

1050
01:19:39.576 --> 01:19:41.992
It's like he was himself again.

1051
01:19:41.993 --> 01:19:43.868
I've seen him, Jade.

1052
01:19:45.118 --> 01:19:46.784
He's in pain.

1053
01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:51.201
And every second
is agony for him.

1054
01:19:53.659 --> 01:19:55.743
Just come to mine.

1055
01:19:57.409 --> 01:19:59.075
<i>And I'll show you.</i>

1056
01:19:59.076 --> 01:20:01.158
Show me what?

1057
01:20:01.159 --> 01:20:03.409
<i>You just have to be here, Jade.</i>

1058
01:20:04.409 --> 01:20:06.076
<i>Please.</i>

1059
01:20:07.159 --> 01:20:09.409
<i>- Just trust me.</i>
- Oh, shit.

1060
01:20:10.576 --> 01:20:13.034
OK. I'll be there in 10.

1061
01:21:01.743 --> 01:21:02.784
Mia.

1062
01:21:06.243 --> 01:21:07.825
I'm... I'm sorry.

1063
01:21:07.826 --> 01:21:09.409
No, it's OK. Sit.

1064
01:21:18.118 --> 01:21:20.908
I was wondering when
I'd see you again.

1065
01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:22.576
You haven't come.

1066
01:21:24.409 --> 01:21:25.909
You told me not to.

1067
01:21:27.076 --> 01:21:28.659
I know. I was mad.

1068
01:21:30.743 --> 01:21:33.117
You had every right to be.

1069
01:21:33.118 --> 01:21:34.784
Still do.

1070
01:21:36.368 --> 01:21:37.951
No, I don't.

1071
01:21:39.368 --> 01:21:41.368
There were no drugs, Mia.

1072
01:21:43.076 --> 01:21:47.243
He had a breakdown. I just...
I just... couldn't face that.

1073
01:21:48.743 --> 01:21:50.575
I'm so sorry that I blamed you.

1074

him that you were here.
