2
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.347
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:50.316
Travis...

4
00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:52.485
You killed Gellar?

5
00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:54.821
The cops find Gellar, they'll
focus the hunt on Travis.

6
00:01:54.856 --> 00:01:57.291
This way, they'll find
Gellar's fingerprints too.

7
00:01:57.325 --> 00:02:00.127
He recently delivered
flowers to a Jessica Morris.

8
00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:02.464
- Who sent them?
- Thomas Matthews.

9
00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:04.166
Jesus Christ.

10
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.435
Every time the shit
hits the fan, I go to him.

11
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.037
- Dexter?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:11.541
He's your safe place.

13
00:02:11.575 --> 00:02:13.643
- Wormwood.
- What the fuck's a wormwood?

14
00:02:13.678 --> 00:02:15.646
This...

15
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.181
is Wormwood.

16
00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:18.850
I think I found a new lead.

17
00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:21.419
My wife Beth and I
have been chosen to be soldiers

18
00:02:21.454 --> 00:02:22.487
in the final battle.

19
00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:24.222
I'll call Quinn, go check it out.

20
00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:28.962
You're too late.
Wormwood can't be stopped.

21
00:02:28.996 --> 00:02:31.497
Dexter, you have to call the police.

22
00:02:31.532 --> 00:02:33.700
Hurry, they have poison gas.

23
00:02:34.868 --> 00:02:37.203
Miami Metro Homicide.

24
00:02:37.237 --> 00:02:40.273
That's where God wants us
to stage Wormwood.

25
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:55.554
What are we waiting for?

26
00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:58.158
Those guys.

27
00:02:58.192 --> 00:03:00.093
That doesn't look good.

28
00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:03.464
We got an anonymous tip
that D.D.K. is using this boat.

29
00:03:03.498 --> 00:03:06.467
- Plus, there's poison gas.
- Poison gas?

30
00:03:06.502 --> 00:03:08.937
I know, right?
That's all we need.

31
00:03:08.971 --> 00:03:11.173
Part of me was hoping that
this tip was bogus, but the uni

32
00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:13.709
that we sent down found
a body floating near the boat,

33
00:03:13.744 --> 00:03:16.112
so here we are.

34
00:03:16.146 --> 00:03:18.948
All clear!

35
00:03:18.983 --> 00:03:20.683
What do you got?

36
00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:22.786
Chemical traces
of two toxic substances.

37
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.322
Put 'em together,
you got something a lot worse.

38
00:03:25.356 --> 00:03:26.490
Poison gas?

39
00:03:26.524 --> 00:03:27.825
Release it in
the right place--

40
00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.329
say, a closed environment,
like a bus or a building--

41
00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:32.763
you could kill a lot of people.

42
00:03:32.798 --> 00:03:35.800
Fuck me.

43
00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:39.971
That's Holly Benson.

44
00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:43.575
That's the girl D.D.K.
kidnapped and let go.

45
00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.110
Multiple stab wounds...

46
00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:47.779
Looks like they weren't done with her.

47
00:03:47.813 --> 00:03:52.050
There's more inside.

48
00:03:52.084 --> 00:03:53.885
This is where they were
handling the stuff.

49
00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.121
From the looks of it,
they knew what they were doing.

50
00:03:57.156 --> 00:03:59.290
Wormwood, the next tableau,
is supposed to represent

51
00:03:59.324 --> 00:04:02.159
- a meteor falling to earth.
- And poisoning mankind.

52
00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:03.960
Could this be Wormwood, right here?

53
00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:05.729
I doubt it.

54
00:04:05.763 --> 00:04:08.764
These people weren't killed by gas.

55
00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.833
This looks like where
Wormwood is being prepared.

56
00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:12.601
So what's D.D.K.
planning to do?

57
00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:15.604
Release poison gas on people?

58
00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.606
We can't just sit on this.

59
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.608
We have to alert Homeland Security.

60
00:04:18.642 --> 00:04:20.277
Should I notify Laguerta?

61
00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:22.345
Do it.

62
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.515
What's his story?

63
00:04:24.549 --> 00:04:28.019
Upper abdominal stab wound.

64
00:04:28.053 --> 00:04:31.790
Looks like it happened right here...

65
00:04:31.824 --> 00:04:34.793
Bled out, fell to this position.

66
00:04:34.827 --> 00:04:36.795
Expired.

67
00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:38.663
There are fingerprints on the knife.

68
00:04:38.698 --> 00:04:40.198
Travis' fingerprints,

69
00:04:40.232 --> 00:04:44.669
since it's the knife
Travis used to kill Holly.

70
00:04:44.703 --> 00:04:47.438
Holy shit, Steve Dorsey.
It's Doomsday Adam.

71
00:04:47.473 --> 00:04:50.108
- Oh, wow.
- What?

72
00:04:50.142 --> 00:04:52.443
I found a video blog post
by him yesterday.

73
00:04:52.478 --> 00:04:55.546
He was going on about how
he'd been chosen to be a soldier

74
00:04:55.581 --> 00:04:57.982
- in the final battle.
- Why didn't you tell anyone?

75
00:04:58.016 --> 00:04:59.383
I did.
I told sergeant Batista.

76
00:04:59.417 --> 00:05:03.187
He was going to Dorsey's
apartment to check it out.

77
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:04.822
Where is Angel?

78
00:05:10.796 --> 00:05:12.730
You don't understand, but you will.

79
00:05:12.764 --> 00:05:16.234
When this is over,
and the new world begins,

80
00:05:16.268 --> 00:05:17.569
you will wish you had faith.

81
00:05:17.603 --> 00:05:20.739
I do have faith.
I believe in God.

82
00:05:20.773 --> 00:05:23.342
Well, then you better
start praying to him...

83
00:05:23.377 --> 00:05:27.347
and fast.

84
00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.897
Look at me.

85
00:05:43.932 --> 00:05:46.233
There must be something
very special about you, Beth,

86
00:05:46.267 --> 00:05:50.304
because it is no accident
that you are here.

87
00:05:50.338 --> 00:05:55.075
Out of all the people
in the world, God chose you

88
00:05:55.109 --> 00:05:57.678
to carry out his will.

89
00:05:57.712 --> 00:06:00.714
God reserves a place for
those that sacrifice themselves

90
00:06:00.748 --> 00:06:04.650
in his name, and it is a place...

91
00:06:04.684 --> 00:06:09.288
too beautiful to describe.

92
00:06:09.322 --> 00:06:11.723
And I envy you,

93
00:06:11.757 --> 00:06:15.527
because you get
to see it before I can.

94
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:21.266
- Now, did you pray?
- Oh, yes.

95
00:06:21.301 --> 00:06:25.271
Then we're ready.

96
00:06:27.908 --> 00:06:29.909
Everything is in place.

97
00:06:29.943 --> 00:06:33.379
After I do the switch,
how long before it goes off?

98
00:06:33.414 --> 00:06:36.115
A couple of seconds
to let the chemicals to mix.

99
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.785
Now, remember,
when you enter the building,

100
00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:41.955
you'll see a door with a card reader.

101
00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:44.691
You will take the sergeant's
keycard and buzz open the door.

102
00:06:44.725 --> 00:06:48.628
It's the only way
to bypass the metal detector.

103
00:06:48.662 --> 00:06:53.066
All right, okay.
I understand.

104
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.969
This is a great day.

105
00:06:57.004 --> 00:07:01.007
It's the beginning of the end.

106
00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:07.412
- Yeah?
- It's me.

107
00:07:07.447 --> 00:07:09.081
I've been calling you
for five minutes.

108
00:07:09.115 --> 00:07:11.817
- Yeah, I just heard it ring.
- Is Batista with you?

109
00:07:11.852 --> 00:07:13.986
- No.
- Why the fuck not?

110
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.221
I-I figured I'd meet him
at the crime scene, okay?

111
00:07:16.256 --> 00:07:18.123
- What, he isn't there?
- No.

112
00:07:18.158 --> 00:07:20.026
Louis said that
he went to Steve Dorsey's

113
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.194
to check out a Doomsday suspect.

114
00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.030
You're his partner,
you should know that.

115
00:07:25.064 --> 00:07:26.965
I--yeah, I missed a few calls
from him this morning.

116
00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:28.700
Jesus Christ, Quinn!

117
00:07:28.734 --> 00:07:32.069
What the fuck's going on, Deb?

118
00:07:32.104 --> 00:07:34.272
Doomsday Adam, the guy
that he was going to check out,

119
00:07:34.306 --> 00:07:36.907
just turned up dead.

120
00:07:36.942 --> 00:07:39.444
Okay, uh, I got the address.
I'm turning around.

121
00:07:39.478 --> 00:07:41.780
Send backup.

122
00:07:41.814 --> 00:07:45.618
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

123
00:07:45.652 --> 00:07:47.353
Fuck!

124
00:07:47.387 --> 00:07:49.822
Dispatch,
this is lieutenant Debra Morgan.

125
00:07:49.856 --> 00:07:53.058
I need all available units
at 1203 North Gordon

126
00:07:53.093 --> 00:07:55.961
for a probable code 40.

127
00:07:55.996 --> 00:07:58.831
Copy that.

128
00:07:58.865 --> 00:08:00.666
You think Angel ran into Travis?

129
00:08:01.968 --> 00:08:05.504
Well, it sure as fuck
wasn't Steve Dorsey.

130
00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:07.506
I'm sure he's okay.

131
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:09.108
If Travis is there,
we've gotta catch him

132
00:08:09.142 --> 00:08:13.145
before he does God knows what
to how many people.

133
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.025
- Hello?
- It's me. I made it.

134
00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:01.397
- Are you in Homicide yet?
- I'm on my way right now.

135
00:09:01.431 --> 00:09:04.400
Remember, it's lieutenant
Morgan that is leading

136
00:09:04.434 --> 00:09:07.603
this attack against us.
You must get to her.

137
00:09:07.637 --> 00:09:11.807
- I will.
- God bless you, Beth.

138
00:09:11.841 --> 00:09:15.810
I'll see you on the other side.

139
00:09:22.717 --> 00:09:24.084
Can I help you?

140
00:09:24.119 --> 00:09:27.254
I have information regarding
the Doomsday Killer case.

141
00:09:27.288 --> 00:09:29.856
Fill this out, and we'll send
an officer out to interview you.

142
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.426
No! I have to speak
to lieutenant Morgan in person.

143
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.129
Tell her it's Wormwood,
the next tableau.

144
00:09:37.163 --> 00:09:39.331
- "Wormwood"?
- Tell lieutenant Morgan that.

145
00:09:39.366 --> 00:09:41.333
Lieutenant Morgan's
out in the field right now,

146
00:09:41.368 --> 00:09:45.071
- I'm not sure when she'll be--
- Oh, I'll wait.

147
00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:49.075
Take a seat.

148
00:10:11.368 --> 00:10:16.071
I've kept you alive
in case we ran into problems.

149
00:10:16.106 --> 00:10:19.641
Everything's going perfectly.

150
00:10:19.676 --> 00:10:21.376
So you don't need me anymore.

151
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.112
No.

152
00:10:25.147 --> 00:10:28.882
I'd still like to get that prayer.

153
00:10:28.916 --> 00:10:32.919
Go ahead. Pray.

154
00:10:40.262 --> 00:10:42.096
Your time is up.

155
00:11:20.468 --> 00:11:22.435
I'm all right.
It's Travis Marshall.

156
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.837
He went out the window.

157
00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:26.006
All units, we got Travis
Marshall heading west on foot

158
00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:27.408
on McNulty--he's armed.

159
00:11:27.442 --> 00:11:31.679
- I'm okay, go after him.
- Fuck you.

160
00:11:31.714 --> 00:11:34.149
We have a tentative match
on the knife fingerprints.

161
00:11:34.184 --> 00:11:35.651
- They're Travis'.
- I don't get it.

162
00:11:35.685 --> 00:11:37.887
If Doomsday Adam was working
with Travis and Gellar,

163
00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:40.756
- then why kill him?
- Maybe he was done with him,

164
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.959
and the knife
was his severance package.

165
00:11:43.993 --> 00:11:48.264
Tough gig.

166
00:11:48.298 --> 00:11:51.200
Homeland is putting
their regional teams on alert,

167
00:11:51.234 --> 00:11:52.702
and they're sending
agents to the station.

168
00:11:52.736 --> 00:11:54.537
Sounds like they want
to take over the case.

169
00:11:54.571 --> 00:11:55.872
Well, it wouldn't fucking surprise me.

170
00:11:55.906 --> 00:11:57.540
It's what the feds do best.

171
00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:03.813
- Morgan.
- Angel's okay.

172
00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.016
- Thank God.
- What happened?

173
00:12:06.051 --> 00:12:09.687
Travis Marshall had him.
He took off on foot.

174
00:12:09.721 --> 00:12:12.089
Got a head start, but I got
unis setting up a perimeter.

175
00:12:12.123 --> 00:12:14.992
Order up as many men as you need.

176
00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:19.497
- Angel?
- He's fine.

177
00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:21.599
- Did we find Travis?
- No, he got away,

178
00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:25.002
but there's still a chance
we might catch him.

179
00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:27.504
At least Angel's okay.

180
00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.339
Thank God we got that anonymous tip.

181
00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:30.441
She's right.

182
00:12:30.475 --> 00:12:31.809
If I hadn't brought in the police,

183
00:12:31.843 --> 00:12:36.413
Angel would most likely be dead.

184
00:12:36.447 --> 00:12:39.416
You know that dead
call girl, Jessica Morris?

185
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.484
What about her?

186
00:12:40.518 --> 00:12:43.053
I think I know who the john was.

187
00:12:43.087 --> 00:12:45.188
- Who?
- Matthews.

188
00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:47.791
- Matthews?
- The fucking deputy chief.

189
00:12:47.825 --> 00:12:49.993
I don't know what the fuck to do.

190
00:12:50.027 --> 00:12:51.428
He was one of dad's best friends,

191
00:12:51.462 --> 00:12:54.163
he was practically my mentor.

192
00:12:54.198 --> 00:12:56.365
I can't just bust him.
I owe him more than that.

193
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.867
You want to know my opinion?

194
00:12:57.901 --> 00:12:59.268
Yes! That's why
I'm talking to you.

195
00:12:59.302 --> 00:13:01.769
Put this on the backburner
until Travis is in custody.

196
00:13:01.804 --> 00:13:03.271
You need to focus on D.D.K.

197
00:13:03.305 --> 00:13:05.773
I'm having dinner
with Matthews tonight.

198
00:13:05.807 --> 00:13:07.841
I can't just sit there
and talk about the salad.

199
00:13:07.876 --> 00:13:09.543
Okay, so bring it up,

200
00:13:09.577 --> 00:13:12.446
but maybe Matthews
has a reason for what he did.

201
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.181
Yeah--ass.

202
00:13:14.215 --> 00:13:18.385
No, I mean about leaving the scene.

203
00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:22.723
There are worse secrets
you can have, Deb.

204
00:13:22.757 --> 00:13:25.359
I'm just saying, maybe
you should keep an open mind.

205
00:13:25.394 --> 00:13:29.831
Yes, I get what you're saying.

206
00:13:31.935 --> 00:13:33.936
The hunt for Travis has hit a wall,

207
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:39.074
but maybe there's a way around it.

208
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:44.045
Steve Dorsey,
A.K.A Doomsday Adam,

209
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.181
Travis' recently deceased acolyte.

210
00:13:47.215 --> 00:13:48.649
There might be something
in your history

211
00:13:48.684 --> 00:13:50.517
that can lead me to Travis.

212
00:13:50.552 --> 00:13:53.120
Or lead <i>us</i> to Travis,
since anything I find

213
00:13:53.154 --> 00:13:55.855
I'll report to Deb.

214
00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:00.894
Unfortunately, Dorsey
has led a squeaky clean life...

215
00:14:02.162 --> 00:14:03.162
mostly.

216
00:14:03.196 --> 00:14:04.730
He's a potential mass murderer

217
00:14:04.765 --> 00:14:06.899
with eight outstanding
parking tickets.

218
00:14:14.142 --> 00:14:17.645
- Hey, any update?
- No, nothing yet,

219
00:14:17.679 --> 00:14:20.014
but search teams
are expanding the perimeter.

220
00:14:20.048 --> 00:14:23.785
Which means Travis Marshall
most likely got away.

221
00:14:23.819 --> 00:14:26.622
- You don't know that.
- I'm not trying to be critical,

222
00:14:26.656 --> 00:14:28.290
I'm just trying to get
a lay of the land.

223
00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:31.127
Homeland Security
will be here within the hour.

224
00:14:31.161 --> 00:14:33.462
They'll need an update,
and they've requested

225
00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:36.265
all relevant
materials on D.D.K.

226
00:14:36.299 --> 00:14:37.633
Which means Travis
probably isn't the only thing

227
00:14:37.667 --> 00:14:40.169
I've lost today.

228
00:14:40.203 --> 00:14:44.206
However it shakes out,
we'll handle it.

229
00:14:49.547 --> 00:14:52.015
- Excuse me, lieutenant?
- What is it?

230
00:14:52.049 --> 00:14:53.450
There's a woman here who says she has

231
00:14:53.484 --> 00:14:55.319
important information
about D.D.K.

232
00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.088
Which is?

233
00:14:57.122 --> 00:14:58.522
She insists on speaking
to you personally.

234
00:14:58.557 --> 00:15:02.527
She says it has to do
with something called Wormwood.

235
00:15:02.561 --> 00:15:05.964
- Wormwood?
- Yeah.

236
00:15:05.999 --> 00:15:07.900
How the fuck
would she know about that?

237
00:15:07.935 --> 00:15:11.938
- Send her in.
- Yes, ma'am.

238
00:15:19.747 --> 00:15:23.751
What did stalkers
do before the Internet?

239
00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:53.144
Is this Wormwood?

240
00:15:53.178 --> 00:15:55.146
Thank you, again, for coming.

241
00:15:57.983 --> 00:16:02.286
Get everyone out of here!

242
00:16:03.822 --> 00:16:07.792
Evacuate the building!
Go! Now!

243
00:16:27.379 --> 00:16:29.380
Dex, she's gone!
Let's go!

244
00:16:31.683 --> 00:16:33.017
I'll give you everything you need.

245
00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:34.418
I just need to go check on my brother.

246
00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:37.521
I'll be right back, okay?

247
00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:44.194
- Homeland Security?
- Yeah, you were right.

248
00:16:44.229 --> 00:16:46.496
They want everything
we have on D.D.K.

249
00:16:46.531 --> 00:16:48.732
It'll slow us down to a crawl.
Is he all right?

250
00:16:48.766 --> 00:16:50.000
I'm fine.

251
00:16:50.034 --> 00:16:51.668
I love you,
but I wasn't talking to you.

252
00:16:51.703 --> 00:16:54.538
I mean, he was lucky.
The exposure was very mild,

253
00:16:54.572 --> 00:16:57.374
but this gas attacks
the upper respiratory tract.

254
00:16:57.408 --> 00:17:00.376
You could get nosebleeds
followed by extreme dizziness,

255
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:02.378
especially after physical exertion.

256
00:17:02.412 --> 00:17:03.946
You need to get to the hospital.

257
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.181
Got it.

258
00:17:06.216 --> 00:17:08.384
- You gonna go to the E.R.?
- On my honor.

259
00:17:08.418 --> 00:17:10.719
Stop with the sarcastic
bullshit, all right?

260
00:17:10.753 --> 00:17:13.288
No bullshit, I will.
Really.

261
00:17:13.322 --> 00:17:16.791
Okay.

262
00:17:16.825 --> 00:17:20.795
How did you know
that crazy bitch was a threat?

263
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:22.196
Just luck, I guess.

264
00:17:22.231 --> 00:17:26.033
Fuck luck, I'll take you.

265
00:17:26.068 --> 00:17:29.770
Dex, you saved a lot of lives today.

266
00:17:29.804 --> 00:17:33.773
You saved my life.

267
00:17:33.808 --> 00:17:38.779
I'd never let anything happen to you.

268
00:17:38.814 --> 00:17:42.817
Come here.

269
00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:58.468
It's just for a little while, okay?

270
00:17:58.502 --> 00:18:03.473
Daddy's gonna miss you every
second of those 48 hours.

271
00:18:03.507 --> 00:18:04.474
Mwah.

272
00:18:04.508 --> 00:18:06.276
If Travis can attack Miami Metro,

273
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.177
he can find his way to me.

274
00:18:08.211 --> 00:18:10.179
I can't take that risk.

275
00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:12.248
I've always known
something could happen to me,

276
00:18:12.282 --> 00:18:16.852
but now it's more than my life
I have to worry about.

277
00:18:16.886 --> 00:18:20.355
Hey, thanks for coming back.

278
00:18:20.389 --> 00:18:22.924
Oh, I knew I shouldn't have left.

279
00:18:22.959 --> 00:18:26.861
Sorry to ruin your date...
and your weekend.

280
00:18:26.895 --> 00:18:28.329
It's okay.

281
00:18:28.363 --> 00:18:31.199
It's not every day your boss
becomes a bona fide hero.

282
00:18:31.233 --> 00:18:34.068
Yeah, well, I'm not
feeling too heroic right now.

283
00:18:34.102 --> 00:18:35.670
I'm starting to feel
the side effects that

284
00:18:35.704 --> 00:18:37.938
that doctor was talking about.

285
00:18:37.973 --> 00:18:39.873
I realized I'm probably
not the best person

286
00:18:39.908 --> 00:18:41.742
to be in charge of this little guy.

287
00:18:41.776 --> 00:18:44.311
Well, it's not a problem.
You just get some rest.

288
00:18:44.345 --> 00:18:46.146
I'll keep him out of you.

289
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.715
Better idea: I booked
you guys a room at the Ritz

290
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.351
- in Coconut Grove.
- Sweet!

291
00:18:51.386 --> 00:18:54.988
Have you picked your animal yet?

292
00:18:55.022 --> 00:18:56.422
Must've slipped my mind.

293
00:18:56.457 --> 00:18:59.158
At the pageant, every child
is paired with a parent

294
00:18:59.193 --> 00:19:02.028
to bring the story
of Noah's ark to life.

295
00:19:02.062 --> 00:19:04.630
I think Harrison's a little
scared of the whole thing.

296
00:19:04.665 --> 00:19:07.266
Oh, don't worry, buddy.

297
00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.002
Daddy will be there.
I promise.

298
00:19:10.036 --> 00:19:12.104
And you should pick
one of the good animals soon,

299
00:19:12.138 --> 00:19:15.440
or you'll end up being rats
or turtles or something.

300
00:19:15.475 --> 00:19:17.976
Oh.

301
00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:19.744
King of the Beasts.

302
00:19:19.779 --> 00:19:23.381
Something feels right about that.

303
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.655
Travis has one tableau left,

304
00:19:31.689 --> 00:19:35.158
who knows how many people
he'll try to kill next.

305
00:19:35.193 --> 00:19:37.461
And he might go after Debra again,

306
00:19:37.495 --> 00:19:39.730
just like he did with Holly.

307
00:19:39.765 --> 00:19:43.234
So you're changing your plan
about working with Miami Metro?

308
00:19:43.268 --> 00:19:46.037
Miami Metro has been
sidelined by Homeland Security.

309
00:19:46.071 --> 00:19:52.044
It's time for my Dark Passenger
to take the wheel again.

310
00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:55.047
According to the seven keys,
the next tableau will be

311
00:19:55.082 --> 00:19:58.317
the Lake of Fire.

312
00:19:58.352 --> 00:20:02.221
"And Satan, who is the beast,

313
00:20:02.255 --> 00:20:04.656
"was thrown into the lake of fire,

314
00:20:04.691 --> 00:20:07.191
which is the second death..."

315
00:20:07.226 --> 00:20:10.094
It says the beast
gathers the kings of the earth,

316
00:20:10.129 --> 00:20:15.366
and their armies,
to prepare for war against God.

317
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.404
And he's responsible
for killing the two witnesses.

318
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.892
You really should have
gone to the E.R., Dex.

319
00:20:37.926 --> 00:20:40.761
- I don't have time.
- I have to find Travis.

320
00:20:40.795 --> 00:20:45.800
You have no leads.
He could be anywhere.

321
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.339
It's time for a Hail Mary.

322
00:20:51.373 --> 00:20:55.577
I'm gonna make Travis come to me.

323
00:20:55.611 --> 00:21:00.216
Maybe it takes a beast
to catch a beast.

324
00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:07.391
That's for you.

325
00:21:07.426 --> 00:21:09.294
Pick up an open-x today,
and never--

326
00:21:09.328 --> 00:21:11.062
You don't need
help operating--

327
00:21:11.096 --> 00:21:13.765
I'm standing outside
the Miami Metro headquarters,

328
00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:16.768
where earlier today,
a local woman, Beth Dorsey,

329
00:21:16.802 --> 00:21:18.369
attempted a poison gas assault

330
00:21:18.404 --> 00:21:20.371
on the station's Homicide department.

331
00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:22.506
Channel Nine has learned
no officers were hurt

332
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:23.808
in the brazen attack.

333
00:21:23.842 --> 00:21:25.810
The only casualty
was Ms. Dorsey.

334
00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:37.221
It's okay.
It's--it's okay.

335
00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:42.226
I-i-it's gonna be okay.

336
00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.230
Her sacrifice will be enough.

337
00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:50.267
It must be what God wanted.

338
00:21:53.504 --> 00:21:57.641
It's up to me now.

339
00:21:57.675 --> 00:22:01.678
My time has come.
I must pass the test.

340
00:22:26.603 --> 00:22:29.239
Half the stuff on here
costs more than my rent.

341
00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:32.642
My treat.

342
00:22:32.676 --> 00:22:34.078
For a job well done...

343
00:22:34.112 --> 00:22:37.047
despite some enormous challenges.

344
00:22:37.081 --> 00:22:38.915
Yeah, it would be a lot
easier if Homeland Security

345
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.383
wasn't breathing down my neck.

346
00:22:40.418 --> 00:22:42.252
Well, just don't let them
become a distraction.

347
00:22:42.286 --> 00:22:44.354
I know only too well
how easy it is to get

348
00:22:44.388 --> 00:22:48.390
bogged down in your job.

349
00:22:50.493 --> 00:22:53.195
That, uh, call girl from the hotel

350
00:22:53.229 --> 00:22:57.465
is a perfect example
of what I'm talking about.

351
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.403
I think I'm gonna have the duck.

352
00:23:00.437 --> 00:23:03.472
I have to admit
I was a bit, uh, puzzled

353
00:23:03.506 --> 00:23:05.208
when I heard you were
still looking into that.

354
00:23:05.242 --> 00:23:08.577
What kind of wine goes with that?

355
00:23:08.612 --> 00:23:10.714
You know, some cases
are better left alone--

356
00:23:10.748 --> 00:23:12.783
Fuck.

357
00:23:12.817 --> 00:23:16.019
I can't do this.

358
00:23:16.054 --> 00:23:17.922
I know you were one of her clients.

359
00:23:17.956 --> 00:23:21.592
- Excuse me?
- Jessica Morris.

360
00:23:21.627 --> 00:23:23.829
I found a card for flowers
sent to her the morning

361
00:23:23.863 --> 00:23:29.302
that she died, from Thomas Matthews.

362
00:23:29.336 --> 00:23:33.340
Were you the one in her
hotel room the night she died?

363
00:23:35.577 --> 00:23:37.077
White.

364
00:23:37.111 --> 00:23:39.246
You should, uh, order the white wine.

365
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.784
Sir.

366
00:23:43.818 --> 00:23:47.788
You can talk to me.

367
00:23:49.825 --> 00:23:54.295
You don't know what it's like, Debra.

368
00:23:54.329 --> 00:23:59.333
Since Maggie died...

369
00:23:59.368 --> 00:24:03.371
I've been alone for a very long time.

370
00:24:07.209 --> 00:24:08.843
I went to the hotel.

371
00:24:08.877 --> 00:24:12.113
We...

372
00:24:12.147 --> 00:24:15.783
And when I came back
into the bedroom...

373
00:24:15.817 --> 00:24:20.287
I found her lying on the floor.

374
00:24:20.322 --> 00:24:24.559
I saw the drugs.

375
00:24:24.593 --> 00:24:27.895
I tried to revive her...

376
00:24:27.929 --> 00:24:32.133
But...

377
00:24:32.167 --> 00:24:37.171
She just wouldn't breathe.

378
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.443
911 wouldn't have helped.
She was dead...

379
00:24:44.612 --> 00:24:48.614
And I couldn't change what happened.

380
00:24:53.219 --> 00:24:56.554
So...

381
00:24:56.589 --> 00:25:00.558
What do you intend to do?

382
00:25:03.094 --> 00:25:06.563
I don't know.

383
00:25:06.598 --> 00:25:10.900
Debra, I've known you
since the day you were born.

384
00:25:10.935 --> 00:25:13.536
You cried in my arms
the night your father died.

385
00:25:13.571 --> 00:25:16.039
I've always looked out for you,

386
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:18.408
and I made you lieutenant,

387
00:25:18.443 --> 00:25:22.913
and now I'm the one who needs a favor.

388
00:25:22.947 --> 00:25:26.317
I want to help you,

389
00:25:26.351 --> 00:25:28.186
but what do I tell that girl's father?

390
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.456
You tell him you found nothing.

391
00:25:31.491 --> 00:25:37.295
She overdosed.
No one needs to know any more.

392
00:25:37.329 --> 00:25:40.698
It's not gonna help anyone.

393
00:25:40.733 --> 00:25:44.735
It'll only hurt me.

394
00:25:47.805 --> 00:25:51.775
I'll call Mr. Morris
in the morning.

395
00:25:54.378 --> 00:25:56.012
Good.

396
00:26:02.888 --> 00:26:05.623
Jeez. You, uh,
sure it's safe to be here?

397
00:26:05.657 --> 00:26:08.494
Relax, sidekick.
Hazmat gave brass the all-clear.

398
00:26:08.528 --> 00:26:10.763
I think I prefer "intern."

399
00:26:10.797 --> 00:26:14.000
Bukkake, bukkaki.
The point is, me as boss

400
00:26:14.034 --> 00:26:16.269
needs you in evidence
for the next few days.

401
00:26:16.303 --> 00:26:18.437
We're suffering
from a serious case of backlog.

402
00:26:18.472 --> 00:26:19.972
I'm on it.

403
00:26:20.007 --> 00:26:21.974
Whoa.
Amazon, 9:00.

404
00:26:22.008 --> 00:26:24.977
Okay, everyone, listen up.

405
00:26:25.011 --> 00:26:27.846
This is agent Hubbard
from Homeland Security.

406
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.448
They'll be taking over
our D.D.K. investigation.

407
00:26:30.482 --> 00:26:31.783
Temporarily.

408
00:26:31.817 --> 00:26:33.818
Until my team and I
can assess all known associates

409
00:26:33.852 --> 00:26:35.185
of the Dorseys.

410
00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.653
So what, we're just
supposed to sit on our ass

411
00:26:36.688 --> 00:26:38.589
for the next four days
until the world ends?

412
00:26:38.623 --> 00:26:40.591
You want to take that one?

413
00:26:40.625 --> 00:26:42.560
I understand your frustration,

414
00:26:42.594 --> 00:26:45.097
but this police station came
under a gas attack yesterday.

415
00:26:45.131 --> 00:26:46.865
In the government's eyes,
that poses a potential

416
00:26:46.899 --> 00:26:48.200
ongoing terrorist threat.

417
00:26:48.235 --> 00:26:51.170
Steve and Beth Dorsey
weren't terrorists.

418
00:26:51.205 --> 00:26:53.506
They were nutjobs
following a bigger nutjob.

419
00:26:53.541 --> 00:26:55.975
Let me and my team
be the judge of that.

420
00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:59.211
I promise, this will go faster
if everyone cooperates.

421
00:26:59.246 --> 00:27:01.613
They all hate this.
Can't say that I blame them.

422
00:27:01.648 --> 00:27:04.049
Please make yourself
available for interviews.

423
00:27:04.083 --> 00:27:05.483
I'd like to start
with sergeant Batista,

424
00:27:05.518 --> 00:27:08.152
since he was the last one
in contact with the suspects.

425
00:27:08.187 --> 00:27:11.154
Can I set up in your office?

426
00:27:11.189 --> 00:27:15.725
Right this way.

427
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.528
This whole thing's fucking bullshit.

428
00:27:18.562 --> 00:27:21.164
They have one hand
tied behind their backs,

429
00:27:21.198 --> 00:27:22.731
but I don't.

430
00:27:22.766 --> 00:27:25.133
Not when I have Gellar's.

431
00:27:28.972 --> 00:27:31.974
- Hey.
- Not a good time, Quinn.

432
00:27:32.008 --> 00:27:33.808
Yeah, I-I know you
got that interview,

433
00:27:33.843 --> 00:27:36.344
but this'll just take a sec.

434
00:27:36.378 --> 00:27:38.413
Not now.

435
00:27:38.447 --> 00:27:42.282
Look, I'm so, so sorry.

436
00:27:42.317 --> 00:27:44.985
Look, you saved my life,

437
00:27:45.019 --> 00:27:48.054
and for that,
I will always be grateful.

438
00:27:48.089 --> 00:27:51.858
But this is a job of trust.

439
00:27:51.892 --> 00:27:55.895
And I can't have
a partner I can't trust.

440
00:28:00.001 --> 00:28:01.134
You've been talking a lot

441
00:28:01.169 --> 00:28:03.270
about your department this morning,

442
00:28:03.272 --> 00:28:06.974
but how
are you doing since the attack?

443
00:28:07.009 --> 00:28:09.477
I'm fine.

444
00:28:09.512 --> 00:28:13.415
Pretty much, I mean...

445
00:28:13.449 --> 00:28:16.018
I'm worried about Dexter.
He wouldn't go to the hospital.

446
00:28:16.052 --> 00:28:17.920
He keeps saying he's okay.

447
00:28:17.954 --> 00:28:20.089
You must be very proud of him.

448
00:28:20.123 --> 00:28:23.825
He saved everyone's life...

449
00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:29.331
Including mine.

450
00:28:29.365 --> 00:28:31.133
It all happened so fast, you know?

451
00:28:31.167 --> 00:28:35.504
If that canister
had gone off any sooner...

452
00:28:35.538 --> 00:28:40.509
Your brother holds a very
important place in your life.

453
00:28:40.544 --> 00:28:45.281
He's really all I have.

454
00:28:45.315 --> 00:28:47.817
You think I'm crazy now,

455
00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:49.952
oh, I can't even imagine
what a fucking mess

456
00:28:49.986 --> 00:28:51.754
my life would be without him.

457
00:28:51.788 --> 00:28:53.689
I don't think you're crazy.

458
00:28:53.723 --> 00:28:56.225
Can I get that in writing?

459
00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.661
From what I do know about you,

460
00:28:58.696 --> 00:29:01.664
you feel things very deeply.

461
00:29:01.699 --> 00:29:03.466
Like your bond with Dexter.

462
00:29:03.501 --> 00:29:06.903
Where do you think that stems from?

463
00:29:06.938 --> 00:29:10.541
Maybe because
he's the only guy in my life

464
00:29:10.576 --> 00:29:16.381
that I haven't dumped,
or cheated on, or...isn't dead.

465
00:29:16.415 --> 00:29:18.883
Is it possible
that your feelings for Dexter

466
00:29:18.918 --> 00:29:21.052
are the reason that
you've chosen men in the past

467
00:29:21.086 --> 00:29:26.324
who have been either
inappropriate or unavailable?

468
00:29:26.359 --> 00:29:28.427
Because they're what?

469
00:29:28.461 --> 00:29:33.232
Not Dexter?

470
00:29:33.266 --> 00:29:35.033
That's insane.

471
00:29:35.068 --> 00:29:39.305
Is it?

472
00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.640
He's my brother.

473
00:29:40.675 --> 00:29:44.678
Yet you're not biologically related.

474
00:29:47.115 --> 00:29:48.449
So?

475
00:29:48.483 --> 00:29:50.351
It would be understandable,

476
00:29:50.385 --> 00:29:53.454
given the past traumas
the two of you have shared,

477
00:29:53.488 --> 00:29:58.692
for you to develop
complex feelings for him.

478
00:29:58.726 --> 00:30:02.262
Why the fuck are we
even talking about this?

479
00:30:02.296 --> 00:30:04.398
You mentioned Dexter.

480
00:30:04.432 --> 00:30:06.033
He comes up in these sessions a lot.

481
00:30:06.067 --> 00:30:07.834
Aren't you curious as to why that is?

482
00:30:07.868 --> 00:30:10.470
He's a huge part of my life.

483
00:30:10.504 --> 00:30:13.840
That's it.
End of story.

484
00:30:13.874 --> 00:30:15.041
You getting upset?

485
00:30:15.075 --> 00:30:16.843
Fuck yes, I'm becoming upset,

486
00:30:16.877 --> 00:30:21.249
because you're making
it sound like I want to...

487
00:30:21.283 --> 00:30:23.517
be with him or something.

488
00:30:23.552 --> 00:30:28.223
Well, do you?

489
00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:40.637
Look...

490
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:44.274
I love my brother,

491
00:30:44.308 --> 00:30:46.810
but I am sure as shit
not in love with my brother,

492
00:30:46.844 --> 00:30:51.615
if that's what you're getting at.

493
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:53.383
We're done here.

494
00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:55.919
Travis got everyone's attention

495
00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:57.955
by staging his tableaus.

496
00:30:57.989 --> 00:31:02.693
It's time I got his
by staging one of my own.

497
00:31:02.727 --> 00:31:05.362
I stashed Gellar's hand in the morgue,

498
00:31:05.397 --> 00:31:08.332
now I need it back.

499
00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:09.701
Hey, Dexter!

500
00:31:09.735 --> 00:31:11.436
I was looking for you in your lab.

501
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.439
Oh, heading home.

502
00:31:15.741 --> 00:31:18.309
Looks like you got a minute.

503
00:31:18.344 --> 00:31:19.978
Haven't we done this before?

504
00:31:20.012 --> 00:31:23.882
I-I just wanted to thank you

505
00:31:23.916 --> 00:31:26.084
for being so honest
with me the other day

506
00:31:26.118 --> 00:31:27.585
about my video game.

507
00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:28.952
Glad I could help.

508
00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:31.355
You just made me realize
that I have spent my whole life

509
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:33.723
on the sidelines
playing make-believe games

510
00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:35.559
and now I want to get out there

511
00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:37.728
and make my life count for something.

512
00:31:37.762 --> 00:31:41.165
- Okay, I really should--
- Yeah, go. Go.

513
00:31:41.199 --> 00:31:42.733
All right.

514
00:31:42.768 --> 00:31:44.535
I hope you're feeling better.

515
00:32:52.103 --> 00:32:57.107
I have no idea where Travis
is hiding or what he's up to.

516
00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:12.823
The Lake of Fire is his next tableau,

517
00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:15.559
but mine doesn't require a name,

518
00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:19.596
just the right message.

519
00:33:30.373 --> 00:33:33.608
And the best way to get Travis
to pay attention to that message

520
00:33:33.643 --> 00:33:35.977
is if it comes from me.

521
00:33:36.012 --> 00:33:40.014
Sorry about this.

522
00:33:55.331 --> 00:33:57.232
Aw, the hand is bad.

523
00:33:57.266 --> 00:34:00.469
I've had my tongue in places
that smelled better.

524
00:34:00.503 --> 00:34:03.606
It was on ice for three years
along with the rest of Gellar.

525
00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.574
Decomposition will accelerate faster

526
00:34:05.609 --> 00:34:07.443
the longer it's in the sun.

527
00:34:07.477 --> 00:34:08.911
Looks like the cut was made just above

528
00:34:08.946 --> 00:34:11.480
the palmar carpal ligament.

529
00:34:11.515 --> 00:34:14.550
666, the sign of the beast.
What's up with that?

530
00:34:14.585 --> 00:34:16.585
Travis will know.

531
00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.088
- What do we know?
- Street cleaner called it in.

532
00:34:20.123 --> 00:34:23.091
I checked security footage.
If Travis and Gellar did this,

533
00:34:23.125 --> 00:34:24.192
they were out of view.

534
00:34:24.226 --> 00:34:25.726
Well, Travis worked in the museum,

535
00:34:25.761 --> 00:34:27.561
so he would know
every inch of the square.

536
00:34:27.596 --> 00:34:29.330
Hey, guys.

537
00:34:29.364 --> 00:34:32.332
What is it?

538
00:34:32.366 --> 00:34:34.133
All right, cue the music,
hold the applause.

539
00:34:34.168 --> 00:34:35.601
Shoot him.

540
00:34:35.636 --> 00:34:39.205
- The hand belongs to Gellar.
- What?

541
00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:41.007
It's a positive match.

542
00:34:41.041 --> 00:34:43.175
Why the fuck would
Gellar cut off his own hand?

543
00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.311
Well, the cut looks
to have been made postmortem.

544
00:34:45.345 --> 00:34:47.580
Gellar's most likely dead.

545
00:34:47.615 --> 00:34:50.015
So student offs professor?
Why?

546
00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.518
Good way to, uh,
get rid of an accomplice.

547
00:34:52.552 --> 00:34:54.353
I mean, look at Steve Dorsey.

548
00:34:54.388 --> 00:34:56.222
Travis is a psycho.

549
00:34:56.256 --> 00:35:00.860
He may not even be sticking
to the Enesserette gameplan,

550
00:35:00.894 --> 00:35:03.262
'cause if this is supposed
to be the lake of fire,

551
00:35:03.296 --> 00:35:05.864
I don't get it.

552
00:35:05.899 --> 00:35:07.299
Let's have the unis sweep the area,

553
00:35:07.333 --> 00:35:09.668
maybe we can turn up Gellar's body.

554
00:35:09.702 --> 00:35:11.903
It might lead us to Travis.

555
00:35:11.938 --> 00:35:13.071
Not likely.

556
00:35:13.105 --> 00:35:17.075
I left Gellar in pieces in the swamp.

557
00:35:21.315 --> 00:35:22.381
Right on time.

558
00:35:22.416 --> 00:35:27.020
My tableau should
send Travis right to me.

559
00:35:29.224 --> 00:35:31.659
Now he just needs to know where to go.

560
00:35:31.693 --> 00:35:32.961
..If they have
any leads at all.

561
00:35:32.995 --> 00:35:35.397
And now we go to museum square
for this breaking news.

562
00:35:35.431 --> 00:35:37.933
Authorities are still
baffled by what appears to be

563
00:35:37.967 --> 00:35:40.602
yet another bizarre
end of days tableau

564
00:35:40.637 --> 00:35:41.970
plaguing the city of Miami.

565
00:35:42.005 --> 00:35:44.974
We warn you, these images
are very graphic.

566
00:35:45.008 --> 00:35:47.209
Investigators made
a gruesome discovery

567
00:35:47.244 --> 00:35:48.944
early this morning in museum square.

568
00:35:48.978 --> 00:35:52.580
Blood covered the angel statue
in the square's fountain,

569
00:35:52.615 --> 00:35:55.349
and also contaminated
the fountain's water.

570
00:35:55.384 --> 00:35:58.219
A human hand was found
nailed to the angel's chest.

571
00:35:58.254 --> 00:36:00.489
On the forehead, the numbers 666...

572
00:36:00.523 --> 00:36:02.524
- The beast.
- Were also written in blood.

573
00:36:02.558 --> 00:36:04.627
Channel Nine has learned
that the hand depicted

574
00:36:04.661 --> 00:36:07.230
in these startling images
may in fact belong to one

575
00:36:07.264 --> 00:36:08.965
of the suspected
Doomsday Killers--

576
00:36:08.999 --> 00:36:10.834
Professor James Gellar.

577
00:36:10.868 --> 00:36:12.769
No.

578
00:36:12.804 --> 00:36:14.972
No. No!

579
00:36:18.877 --> 00:36:21.845
Mark this day, witness.

580
00:36:21.879 --> 00:36:25.181
The end is not upon the world,
it's upon you.

581
00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:29.386
You know who I am.
You know what I am.

582
00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.856
The beast is coming for you.

583
00:36:36.261 --> 00:36:40.230
The slice of life.

584
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:29.713
Close the door.

585
00:37:29.748 --> 00:37:33.184
- Everything--
- Goddamn it, Debra.

586
00:37:33.218 --> 00:37:35.820
I thought we had an understanding.

587
00:37:35.854 --> 00:37:38.623
- I'm a little confused here.
- Oh, don't get cute.

588
00:37:38.657 --> 00:37:42.794
Chief Lane has somehow come
to learn about my indiscretions.

589
00:37:42.828 --> 00:37:45.630
He's asking me to retire!

590
00:37:45.664 --> 00:37:48.265
Is this how you repay me
after all I've done for you?

591
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.000
I was at a crime scene all day.

592
00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:51.001
I haven't talked to anyone.

593
00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:52.669
It doesn't matter.

594
00:37:52.704 --> 00:37:56.807
You just wouldn't let this thing go!

595
00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:04.781
Your father would be so disappointed.

596
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:10.820
So would your late wife.

597
00:38:10.854 --> 00:38:13.388
All due respect, I didn't
do anything wrong here.

598
00:38:13.423 --> 00:38:15.791
No...

599
00:38:15.825 --> 00:38:18.894
What you did was screw over the
only person that can protect you

600
00:38:18.928 --> 00:38:22.898
from a job that you
are clearly not ready for.

601
00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:27.937
Good luck.

602
00:38:27.971 --> 00:38:31.974
You're gonna need it.

603
00:38:38.348 --> 00:38:42.752
You wanted to see us?

604
00:38:42.786 --> 00:38:45.155
Is everything okay?

605
00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:47.423
Agent Hubbard just called.

606
00:38:47.457 --> 00:38:48.791
Homeland Security has concluded

607
00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:51.194
that the Dorseys
have no ties to terrorists.

608
00:38:51.228 --> 00:38:52.628
No shit.

609
00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:55.130
They want to be kept
in the loop, as does the FBI,

610
00:38:55.165 --> 00:38:57.533
- but we're back in control.
- That's good news.

611
00:38:57.568 --> 00:38:59.435
It would be, if I hadn't
just read your reports

612
00:38:59.469 --> 00:39:03.205
on what happened
at Steve Dorsey's apartment.

613
00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.808
What the fuck?

614
00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:07.877
Seriously, I should
write both of you up.

615
00:39:07.911 --> 00:39:11.647
- That was all my fault, Deb.
- It's lieutenant.

616
00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:15.785
And I got that.

617
00:39:15.819 --> 00:39:19.088
You guys, we have two fucking
days to catch Travis Marshall

618
00:39:19.122 --> 00:39:20.923
before he does God knows what
in something called

619
00:39:20.957 --> 00:39:22.925
the Lake of Fire.

620
00:39:22.959 --> 00:39:24.994
We just got this case back.

621
00:39:25.028 --> 00:39:26.729
I cannot afford
to have this department

622
00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:29.965
falling down
around me right now, okay?

623
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.801
No more fuck-ups.

624
00:39:32.836 --> 00:39:36.839
We get Travis Marshall, you got it?

625
00:39:40.076 --> 00:39:43.277
I made sure the slice of life
was in the video I sent Travis.

626
00:39:43.311 --> 00:39:47.248
He'll be expecting
to find me on my boat.

627
00:39:47.282 --> 00:39:48.583
Not this one.

628
00:39:48.617 --> 00:39:51.686
The owners use it twice a year,

629
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.489
but I only need it once...

630
00:39:54.523 --> 00:39:58.492
for Travis' final tableau.

631
00:40:03.198 --> 00:40:06.134
Captain!

632
00:40:06.168 --> 00:40:07.569
Morgan.

633
00:40:07.603 --> 00:40:10.238
You going to pick out
blinds for Matthews' office?

634
00:40:10.273 --> 00:40:13.475
- You heard the news.
- From Matthews.

635
00:40:13.509 --> 00:40:14.842
Because he thought
that I ratted him out,

636
00:40:14.877 --> 00:40:16.477
but we both know
that it was you, right?

637
00:40:16.512 --> 00:40:19.380
Rumors do have a way of spreading.

638
00:40:19.414 --> 00:40:21.115
So Matthews comes to you
and asks for help,

639
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.450
and you go along with it,

640
00:40:22.484 --> 00:40:25.019
until Jessica Morris' father shows up.

641
00:40:25.054 --> 00:40:26.287
Now, is that about
the time that you realized

642
00:40:26.322 --> 00:40:28.256
you could stab him in the back?

643
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:29.557
Interesting theory,

644
00:40:29.592 --> 00:40:32.960
but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

645
00:40:32.995 --> 00:40:36.864
Fucking used me to take
him out and help yourself.

646
00:40:36.899 --> 00:40:40.201
Don't be so naive, Morgan.

647
00:40:40.236 --> 00:40:41.803
This is how the game is played.

648
00:40:41.837 --> 00:40:44.906
Did you really think that
Matthews made you lieutenant

649
00:40:44.941 --> 00:40:46.141
because you were ready?

650
00:40:46.175 --> 00:40:49.478
It was all politics,
to get back at me.

651
00:40:49.512 --> 00:40:52.748
And that was his last mistake.

652
00:40:52.782 --> 00:40:55.517
How do you sleep?

653
00:40:55.551 --> 00:40:58.086
Very well, knowing that from now on,

654
00:40:58.121 --> 00:41:00.088
you'll do what I say when I say it,

655
00:41:00.123 --> 00:41:02.591
or I'll find a lieutenant who will.

656
00:41:08.832 --> 00:41:13.001
So Laguerta's going on and on, and...

657
00:41:13.036 --> 00:41:15.604
I'm dying inside.

658
00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:19.308
And all of the sudden,
I have one of those...

659
00:41:19.342 --> 00:41:21.743
those moments where everything
sort of comes together.

660
00:41:21.778 --> 00:41:23.679
An epiphany.

661
00:41:23.713 --> 00:41:26.581
Exactly.

662
00:41:26.616 --> 00:41:30.185
And I realize that I have
completely fucked myself

663
00:41:30.219 --> 00:41:32.821
into a corner.

664
00:41:32.855 --> 00:41:35.323
What would you have done differently?

665
00:41:35.357 --> 00:41:37.825
Ignored a grieving father?

666
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.163
Kept a case closed that
didn't sit right with you?

667
00:41:41.197 --> 00:41:43.164
No.

668
00:41:43.199 --> 00:41:46.167
And fuck no.

669
00:41:54.112 --> 00:41:56.713
And I was trying
to give you a compliment.

670
00:41:56.748 --> 00:41:58.181
You've grown so much.

671
00:41:58.216 --> 00:41:59.950
You made the best
out of a bad situation,

672
00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:03.120
because now you see...

673
00:42:03.154 --> 00:42:07.158
everything isn't always
so black and white.

674
00:42:10.162 --> 00:42:14.166
Did you try the noodles?

675
00:42:18.906 --> 00:42:22.074
You have always blown at that.

676
00:42:25.813 --> 00:42:30.217
And you're so good?
Show me.

677
00:42:30.251 --> 00:42:35.289
It's this finger, dumbass.

678
00:42:35.323 --> 00:42:38.192
- Like this?
- Yeah.

679
00:42:38.226 --> 00:42:43.096
Your hand's shaking, what is it?

680
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:47.100
This.

681
00:42:49.603 --> 00:42:55.007
One minute, everything's perfect...

682
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:59.612
and the next minute...

683
00:42:59.647 --> 00:43:01.281
The next minute what?

684
00:43:01.315 --> 00:43:04.951
You're rushing off.

685
00:43:04.986 --> 00:43:08.689
Deb...

686
00:43:08.724 --> 00:43:12.727
I am always with you.

687
00:43:19.669 --> 00:43:22.538
Right here.

688
00:43:25.708 --> 00:43:28.777
Oh, fuck.

689
00:43:46.028 --> 00:43:50.031
It worked.

690
00:43:56.539 --> 00:44:00.508
Oh, no. Not now.

691
00:44:54.498 --> 00:44:59.502
You didn't really think you
could foil God's plan, did you?

692
00:45:01.238 --> 00:45:04.874
This was how it was
always meant to be.

693
00:45:04.908 --> 00:45:10.513
I will wait on a pillar
of light for God's return.

694
00:45:10.547 --> 00:45:13.683
And you'll burn in eternal hellfire.

695
00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:21.157
It is finished.

696
00:46:14.877 --> 00:46:17.745
I thought I was headed
in the right direction.

697
00:46:17.779 --> 00:46:20.514
My Dark Passenger
back behind the wheel.

698
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:24.851
But if I was so sure
I knew where I was going...

699
00:46:24.886 --> 00:46:28.888
How did I get so lost?
