00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:50.128
<i>The story that I want to
tell you cannot be found in a book.</i>

2
00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.697
<i>They say the history of the west was
written from the saddle of a horse,</i>

3
00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.867
<i>but it's never been told
from the heart of one...</i>

4
00:01:57.868 --> 00:01:59.766
<i>Not till now.</i>

5
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.039
<i>I was born here</i>

6
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.667
<i>in this place that would come
to be called the old west</i>

7
00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.612
<i>but to my kind,
the land was ageless.</i>

8
00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:12.006
<i>It had no beginning and no end,</i>

9
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:15.111
<i>no boundary between earth and sky.</i>

10
00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:18.596
<i>Like the wind in the buffalo grass</i>

11
00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:20.665
<i>we belonged here.</i>

12
00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:23.077
<i>We would always belong here.</i>

13
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.648
<i>They say the mustang is
the spirit of the west.</i>

14
00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.275
<i>Whether that west was
won or lost in the end</i>

15
00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.970
<i>you'll have to decide for yourself</i>

16
00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:37.448
<i>but the story I want
to tell you is true.</i>

17
00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:41.019
<i>I was there, and I remember.</i>

18
00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:45.498
<i>I remember the sun and the sky
and the wind calling my name</i>

19
00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.398
<i>in a time when wild
horses ran free.</i>

20
00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.887
<i>Here I am.</i>

21
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.302
<i>This is me.</i>

22
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:46.687
<i>I come into this world
So wild and free</i>

23
00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.473
<i>Here I am.</i>

24
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.958
<i>So young and strong.</i>

25
00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:57.235
<i>Right here in the place
Where I belong.</i>

26
00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.883
<i>It's a new world.</i>

27
00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:03.578
<i>It's a new start.</i>

28
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.141
<i>It's alive with the beating
Of a young heart.</i>

29
00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.836
<i>It's a new day.</i>

30
00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:14.396
<i>In a new land.</i>

31
00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.046
<i>And it's waiting for me</i>

32
00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.342
<i>Here I am</i>

33
00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.202
<i>Oh, it's a new world.</i>

34
00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.351
<i>It's a new start.</i>

35
00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:36.293
<i>It's alive with the beating
Of a young heart.</i>

36
00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.296
<i>Yeah, it's a new day.</i>

37
00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.048
<i>In a new land</i>

38
00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:45.199
<i>And it's waiting for me.</i>

39
00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.866
<i>Here I am</i>

40
00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:35.371
<i>And so I grew from colt to stallion</i>

41
00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:38.749
<i>as wild and reckless as
thunder over the land</i>

42
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.127
<i>racing with the eagle,
soaring with the wind.</i>

43
00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.504
<i>Flying?</i>

44
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.529
<i>There were times
I believed I could.</i>

45
00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:21.083
<i>Like my father before me I became
leader of the Cimarron herd</i>

46
00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:24.086
<i>and with that honor
came responsibility.</i>

47
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:36.602
<i>I hear the wind
Across the plain.</i>

48
00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:44.147
<i>A sound so strong
That calls my name.</i>

49
00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:48.003
<i>It's wild like the river.</i>

50
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:51.654
<i>It's warm like the sun.</i>

51
00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.592
<i>Yeah, it's here.</i>

52
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:57.869
<i>This is where I belong</i>

53
00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:03.128
<i>Under the starry skies.</i>

54
00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:07.189
<i>Where eagles have flown.</i>

55
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.359
<i>This place is paradise.</i>

56
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.196
<i>It's the place I call home.</i>

57
00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:17.991
<i>The moon on the mountains.</i>

58
00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:21.392
<i>The whisper through the trees.</i>

59
00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:24.331
<i>The waves on the water.</i>

60
00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:28.502
<i>Let nothing come
Between this and me</i>

61
00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:32.047
<i>'Cause everything I want.</i>

62
00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:36.153
<i>Is everything that's here.</i>

63
00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:40.036
<i>And when we're all together.</i>

64
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:45.227
<i>There's nothing to fear</i>

65
00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:49.173
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

66
00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.485
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh.</i>

67
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.863
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh...</i>

68
00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:06.165
<i>And wherever I wander.</i>

69
00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:09.987
<i>The one thing I've learned.</i>

70
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.693
<i>Yeah.</i>

71
00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:17.111
<i>It's to here I will always.</i>

72
00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:21.532
<i>Always...</i>

73
00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.411
<i>Return...</i>

74
00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.455
<i>Something new came upon
the land one night,</i>

75
00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:12.522
<i>something that would
change my life forever,</i>

76
00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:16.298
<i>and so, my journey began.</i>

77
00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:16.670
<i>A wiser horse might
have turned and run</i>

78
00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:19.741
<i>but I wanted to know what
strange creatures were here.</i>

79
00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:52.981
What the...

80
00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.810
- Son of a...
- Shh...

81
00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:57.896
Look.

82
00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.548
Man, look at that stallion!

83
00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:02.650
It's beautiful!

84
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.718
Mmm, Sadie Mae.

85
00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:28.718
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

86
00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.122
Get him, boys!

87
00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:35.499
Easy, boy!

88
00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:39.669
C'mon, boys! Let's go!

89
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.238
C'mon, boys!

90
00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:54.201
Hyah! Hyah!

91
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.108
Where did he go? I don't see him.

92
00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.802
We'll find him!

93
00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:13.141
What the...

94
00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:48.697
Faster!

95
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.277
What?

96
00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:08.905
Get him!

97
00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:10.911
Come on!

98
00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:12.154
Get him!

99
00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.419
Hyah! Yah! Yah!

100
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:21.247
Come on, come on, come on!

101
00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.762
- Ha-ha! We got him now!
- You betcha!

102
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.262
Whoa!

103
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.916
Look out!

104
00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.314
Whoa!

105
00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.801
Thought you got away, didn't you, mustang?

106
00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.154
Over here!

107
00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:12.614
Get back here! You crazy?

108
00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:13.740
Get back from him!

109
00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:15.283
Take him! Take him, Joe!

110
00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:16.761
Get the horse!

111
00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.580
He's ours now.

112
00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:27.045
Hold him!

113
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.568
Watch him!

114
00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.132
Watch the lines! Watch the lines!

115
00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:32.300
Come on!

116
00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:34.261
He can do all the
kicking he wants now.

117
00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:36.330
It won't do no good.

118
00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.603
Careful... Careful...

119
00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:11.506
<i>I was scared, and I didn't know
what was going to happen to me</i>

120
00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:14.360
<i>but at least my mother
and the herd were safe.</i>

121
00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.389
- Come on!
- Let's go!

122
00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:21.850
Yo... Come on...

123
00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:26.187
<i>Gotta fight another fight.</i>

124
00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:29.107
<i>I gotta run another night.</i>

125
00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:32.193
<i>Get it out, check it out.</i>

126
00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:35.196
<i>I'm on my way
And it don't feel right.</i>

127
00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:37.741
<i>I gotta get me back.</i>

128
00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:40.812
<i>I can't be beat
And that's a fact.</i>

129
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.538
<i>It's okay, I'll find a way.</i>

130
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:47.083
<i>Ain't gonna take me down
No way.</i>

131
00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:48.668
<i>No.</i>

132
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:52.714
<i>Yeah, don't judge a thing
Till you know what's inside it.</i>

133
00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:55.675
<i>Don't push me
I'll fight it.</i>

134
00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:59.846
<i>Never gonna give in
Never gonna give it up, no.</i>

135
00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:01.431
<i>No.</i>

136
00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:05.185
<i>If you can't catch a wave
Then you're never gonna ride it.</i>

137
00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:07.896
<i>You can't come uninvited.</i>

138
00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:11.672
<i>Never gonna give in
Never gonna give it up, no.</i>

139
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:18.448
<i>You can't take me, I'm free</i>

140
00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:32.003
<i>Why did it all go wrong?</i>

141
00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:35.090
<i>I want to know
What's going on.</i>

142
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:38.259
<i>What's this holding me?</i>

143
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.579
<i>I'm not where
I'm supposed to be.</i>

144
00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:43.890
<i>I gotta fight another fight.</i>

145
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:46.870
<i>I gotta fight With all my might.</i>

146
00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:50.146
<i>I'm getting out, so check it out.</i>

147
00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:53.608
<i>You're in my way, yeah
You better watch out...</i>

148
00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:55.151
Open the gate!

149
00:19:55.152 --> 00:19:59.114
<i>Come on! Don't judge a thing
Till you know what's inside it.</i>

150
00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:01.991
<i>Don't push me, I'll fight it.</i>

151
00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:05.286
<i>Never gonna give in
Never gonna give it up, no.</i>

152
00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:07.789
<i>No.</i>

153
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.959
<i>If you can't catch a wave
Then you're never gonna ride it.</i>

154
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.545
<i>You can't come uninvited.</i>

155
00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:18.341
<i>Never gonna give in
Never gonna give it up, no</i>

156
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:25.583
<i>You can't take me, I'm free</i>

157
00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:29.753
I'm free

158
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.576
What seems to be the
problem, gentlemen?

159
00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.411
We got us a crazy one here, Sir.

160
00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:47.620
Pure mustang, Colonel.

161
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:49.098
Really?

162
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.529
The army has dealt with
wild horses before.

163
00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:57.611
This one will be no different.

164
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:01.676
Come on, mustang.

165
00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:05.998
<i>I remember the first time
I saw a rattler curled up in my path.</i>

166
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:09.559
- Induct this animal, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sir!

167
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.352
<i>This one didn't look like a rattler</i>

168
00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:14.397
<i>but I was still thinking, snake.</i>

169
00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:15.523
Take up that slack.

170
00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:17.626
Grab him! Grab him!

171
00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:20.820
Come on, horse!

172
00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:23.174
Okay, Murphy, he's all yours.

173
00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.575
He's a wild one.

174
00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:29.685
We'll see how wild he is
when I'm done with him.

175
00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.061
See that?

176
00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:39.339
You want to fight, do you?

177
00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:51.100
Right.

178
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:17.899
Make sure that's good and tight.

179
00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:25.426
- Murphy, look out!
- Watch out!

180
00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:29.471
He's a wild one.

181
00:22:35.104 --> 00:22:37.298
You all right, Murph?

182
00:22:47.449 --> 00:22:48.700
You...

183
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:05.447
Murph, you okay?

184
00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:10.638
Corporal, round up some volunteers

185
00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:13.308
to take this animal to the stables.

186
00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:15.127
Not the stables.

187
00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:16.394
Sir?

188
00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:17.917
The corral.

189
00:23:18.147 --> 00:23:20.420
It's time to break that horse.

190
00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:26.654
<i>Well, you think that you can take me on.</i>

191
00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:29.115
<i>You must be crazy...</i>

192
00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:31.184
Make sure it's good and tight.

193
00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:34.454
<i>There ain't a single
thing you've done.</i>

194
00:23:34.455 --> 00:23:37.229
<i>That's gonna faze me</i>

195
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.235
<i>Oh, but if you want to have a go.</i>

196
00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:47.110
<i>I just want to let you know.</i>

197
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:52.555
<i>Yeah, get off of my back
And into my game.</i>

198
00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:56.225
<i>Get out of my way
'Cause I'm wild and untamed.</i>

199
00:23:56.226 --> 00:24:00.957
<i>Get out of my face
Or give it your best shot.</i>

200
00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:04.192
<i>I think it's time
You better face the fact.</i>

201
00:24:04.193 --> 00:24:06.152
<i>Get off of my back...</i>

202
00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:08.927
Okay, my turn!

203
00:24:13.994 --> 00:24:17.246
<i>You know it's all just a game.</i>

204
00:24:17.247 --> 00:24:20.100
<i>That I'm playin'.</i>

205
00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:23.544
<i>Don't think that you
can find a way in...</i>

206
00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:25.004
Lousy heap of horse flesh!

207
00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:26.547
<i>That's what I'm sayin'...</i>

208
00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:29.485
Come on! Run out of there!

209
00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:33.118
<i>Now, if you want to have a go.</i>

210
00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:36.849
<i>I just want to let you know</i>

211
00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:40.728
<i>Get off of my back.</i>

212
00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:42.772
<i>And into my game.</i>

213
00:24:42.773 --> 00:24:46.651
<i>Get out of my face
'Cause I'm wild and untamed.</i>

214
00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:50.488
<i>Get out of my way or give
it your best shot...</i>

215
00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:51.739
We got a rider!

216
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.575
<i>But you know this train
Is comin' off this track.</i>

217
00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:56.577
<i>Get off of my back</i>

218
00:24:57.746 --> 00:25:00.474
<i>Yeah, get off of my back.</i>

219
00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:03.042
<i>Get off.</i>

220
00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:06.713
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...</i>

221
00:25:06.714 --> 00:25:11.426
<i>Get off, get off, get off, get off.</i>

222
00:25:11.427 --> 00:25:13.803
<i>Get off, get off, get off.</i>

223
00:25:13.804 --> 00:25:16.373
<i>Get off of my back</i>

224
00:25:21.812 --> 00:25:23.604
- Sergeant!
- Yes, Sir.

225
00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:25.753
Tie this horse to the post.

226
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:27.714
No food or water.

227
00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:29.795
- Three days.
- Yes, Sir.

228
00:26:25.876 --> 00:26:29.105
<i>My heart galloped
through the skies that night,</i>

229
00:26:29.505 --> 00:26:33.030
<i>back to my herd, where I belonged</i>

230
00:26:34.176 --> 00:26:38.531
<i>and I wondered if they missed
me as much as I missed them.</i>

231
00:27:06.041 --> 00:27:07.792
Get some water over to the stable.

232
00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:12.440
Yes, Sir.

233
00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:34.169
We caught a hostile!

234
00:27:40.117 --> 00:27:42.185
Bring him back this way!

235
00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:49.609
What do we have here?

236
00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:52.712
We caught him by the
supply wagons, Sir.

237
00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:57.072
Ah, a Lakota.

238
00:27:57.384 --> 00:27:59.260
Not as tall as the Cheyenne,

239
00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:01.554
not as fine-featured as the Crow.

240
00:28:01.555 --> 00:28:03.931
Take him away, gentlemen.
Show him our best.

241
00:28:03.932 --> 00:28:05.933
Corporal, take him to the stockades.

242
00:28:05.934 --> 00:28:08.878
Not the stockades... The post.

243
00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:10.730
No food or water.

244
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.046
Come on!

245
00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:21.925
What are you looking at, boy?

246
00:28:23.452 --> 00:28:27.056
<i>He was called Little Creek and
he seemed different from the rest.</i>

247
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:44.494
Hey...

248
00:29:22.344 --> 00:29:26.995
<i>There was just no end to the
strange ways of the two-leggeds.</i>

249
00:29:41.822 --> 00:29:44.175
C-Company! Ten-hut!

250
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.784
With the Colonel's permission, Sir.

251
00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:48.995
Incoming patrol reports
hostiles headed north.

252
00:29:48.996 --> 00:29:50.079
Ah.

253
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.665
The rail road has
expressed concern, Sir.

254
00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:55.042
They've requested
additional patrols.

255
00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:57.795
- How long has it been, sergeant?
- Sir?

256
00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.990
The mustang, how long
has it been tied?

257
00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:02.883
Three days, Sir.

258
00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:06.204
Good. Fetch my crop and spurs.

259
00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:27.346
You can break easy or you
can break hard, mustang!

260
00:30:28.618 --> 00:30:30.619
No! Back up! Back up! Back up!

261
00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:36.459
Come on!

262
00:30:39.463 --> 00:30:40.815
Come on!

263
00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:44.818
Come on... Come on...

264
00:30:45.552 --> 00:30:47.199
Come on, mustang!

265
00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:54.704
Ha!

266
00:31:28.136 --> 00:31:31.740
You see, gentlemen, any
horse can be broken.

267
00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:36.711
Move along, mustang.

268
00:31:39.815 --> 00:31:41.524
There are those in Washington

269
00:31:41.525 --> 00:31:44.253
who believe the west
will never be settled,

270
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.489
the Northern Pacific Railroad
will never breach Nebraska,

271
00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:54.179
a hostile Lakota

272
00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:57.565
will never submit to providence...

273
00:31:59.459 --> 00:32:02.670
And it is that manner
of small thinking

274
00:32:02.671 --> 00:32:05.900
that would say this horse
could never be broken.

275
00:32:06.508 --> 00:32:09.987
Discipline, time and patience,

276
00:32:11.054 --> 00:32:13.498
are the three great levelers.

277
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:21.290
<i>Sometimes a horse has gotta
do what a horse has gotta do.</i>

278
00:32:21.398 --> 00:32:22.481
Mustang?

279
00:32:22.482 --> 00:32:24.630
<i>And this was one of those times.</i>

280
00:32:45.881 --> 00:32:46.982
Oh, no!

281
00:32:52.762 --> 00:32:54.614
You all right, Sir?

282
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.503
Get off me!

283
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:31.534
Soldier, secure that horse!

284
00:34:37.993 --> 00:34:40.619
<i>I wasn't sure
what happened back there</i>

285
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.205
<i>and I wasn't about to stop and ask.</i>

286
00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:46.401
<i>All I knew was that
I was headed home.</i>

287
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.568
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

288
00:35:12.569 --> 00:35:17.015
<i>One moment I was free,
and the next, more ropes.</i>

289
00:35:49.898 --> 00:35:51.966
Steady. Steady.

290
00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:54.590
I'm not going to hurt you.

291
00:35:57.197 --> 00:35:58.640
Nice and easy.

292
00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:07.686
There you go.

293
00:36:08.124 --> 00:36:10.693
That feels better now, doesn't it?

294
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:28.787
Hey, hey!

295
00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:51.752
<i>I couldn't understand it.</i>

296
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.856
<i>She treated this scrawny
two-legged like one of our kind</i>

297
00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:58.650
<i>prancing around him like
a love-struck yearling.</i>

298
00:37:59.778 --> 00:38:01.300
<i>It was downright unnatural.</i>

299
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:13.441
Great mustang, today
I will ride you.

300
00:38:16.252 --> 00:38:18.195
This ought to be good.

301
00:38:42.654 --> 00:38:44.256
Mares!

302
00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:54.354
Okay, Rain, let's see if you can
teach this mustang some manners.

303
00:40:09.991 --> 00:40:13.493
<i>Okay, I admit it, she was charming</i>

304
00:40:13.494 --> 00:40:15.938
<i>in a stubborn,
irritating kind of way.</i>

305
00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:19.275
<i>So, I let her show me her world.</i>

306
00:41:13.054 --> 00:41:14.656
Horsey!

307
00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:36.719
Mmm... Whoo!

308
00:41:41.207 --> 00:41:42.900
Bye-bye, horsey.

309
00:43:42.161 --> 00:43:47.142
<i>For the first time in my life,
I felt my heart torn two ways.</i>

310
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:54.714
Hey, hey...

311
00:43:55.883 --> 00:43:57.985
No! Give it back! Come on!

312
00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:01.038
Mustang, no! Mustang!

313
00:44:01.973 --> 00:44:03.700
Oh, come on.

314
00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:05.475
Oh...

315
00:44:19.198 --> 00:44:20.641
Hmm?

316
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:56.318
<i>I had to hand it to that
boy, he just wouldn't give up.</i>

317
00:45:45.785 --> 00:45:48.513
I'm never going to ride you, am I?

318
00:45:49.956 --> 00:45:52.024
And no one ever should.

319
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:19.961
You can go.

320
00:46:24.907 --> 00:46:26.680
It's okay. Go.

321
00:46:33.249 --> 00:46:34.374
Go on, get out of here!

322
00:46:36.502 --> 00:46:38.104
Go home.

323
00:47:43.402 --> 00:47:47.405
<i>I knew this was hard for
her and that she was scared,</i>

324
00:47:47.406 --> 00:47:48.723
<i>but more than anything,</i>

325
00:47:49.283 --> 00:47:53.104
<i>I wanted to share my
homeland with her.</i>

326
00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:51.241
Ah!

327
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:50.124
<i>I lay beside her
that night, hoping,</i>

328
00:51:50.733 --> 00:51:54.133
<i>praying that somehow
she would be okay.</i>

329
00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.907
There's a couple of horses over there.

330
00:52:25.517 --> 00:52:28.561
Leave the mare. She's not going to make it.

331
00:52:43.577 --> 00:52:45.224
Come on!

332
00:52:45.746 --> 00:52:46.847
Come on!

333
00:53:01.053 --> 00:53:02.450
Oh, Rain.

334
00:53:02.554 --> 00:53:03.826
Oh...

335
00:53:05.474 --> 00:53:07.076
Easy, girl.

336
00:53:07.267 --> 00:53:08.710
Easy.

337
00:53:10.062 --> 00:53:11.709
It'll be okay.

338
00:53:16.694 --> 00:53:18.236
Come on.

339
00:53:18.237 --> 00:53:19.404
Hyah, hyah.

340
00:53:25.828 --> 00:53:27.805
You saved my life.

341
00:53:29.957 --> 00:53:31.499
Two more men on that brace!

342
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.398
Collins! Evans!

343
00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:35.524
Bring it down!

344
00:53:36.839 --> 00:53:38.407
Let's go!

345
00:53:38.799 --> 00:53:41.426
Jackson, grab ahold of that end!

346
00:53:42.928 --> 00:53:44.075
Got it!

347
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.287
This one's loaded.

348
00:53:56.775 --> 00:54:00.596
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Come on. It's gonna be okay.

349
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.619
<i>Sound the bugle now</i>

350
00:54:25.804 --> 00:54:27.906
<i>Play it just for me</i>

351
00:54:30.559 --> 00:54:33.060
<i>As the seasons change.</i>

352
00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:36.540
<i>Remember how I used to be.</i>

353
00:54:38.525 --> 00:54:40.693
<i>Now I can't go on</i>

354
00:54:42.863 --> 00:54:45.136
<i>I can't even start.</i>

355
00:54:47.576 --> 00:54:49.394
<i>I've got nothing left.</i>

356
00:54:50.037 --> 00:54:52.981
<i>Just an empty heart.</i>

357
00:54:55.876 --> 00:54:58.503
<i>I'm a soldier.</i>

358
00:54:58.504 --> 00:55:03.280
<i>Wounded, so I must
give up the fight.</i>

359
00:55:03.592 --> 00:55:07.929
<i>There's nothing more for me.</i>

360
00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:10.158
<i>Lead me away.</i>

361
00:55:14.895 --> 00:55:17.714
<i>Or leave me lying here.</i>

362
00:55:33.205 --> 00:55:35.854
<i>Sound the bugle now.</i>

363
00:55:37.501 --> 00:55:40.150
<i>Tell them I don't care.</i>

364
00:55:41.505 --> 00:55:44.298
<i>There's not a road I know.</i>

365
00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:47.699
<i>That leads to anywhere</i>

366
00:55:49.972 --> 00:55:54.100
<i>Without a light, I fear that.</i>

367
00:55:54.101 --> 00:55:57.455
<i>I will stumble in the dark.</i>

368
00:55:58.522 --> 00:56:01.107
<i>Lay right down.</i>

369
00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:04.360
<i>Decide not to go on</i>

370
00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:09.866
<i>Then from on high.</i>

371
00:56:09.867 --> 00:56:12.891
<i>Somewhere in the distance</i>

372
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:18.207
<i>There's a voice that calls.</i>

373
00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:21.778
<i>Remember who you are.</i>

374
00:56:23.964 --> 00:56:26.132
<i>If you lose yourself</i>

375
00:56:28.677 --> 00:56:31.496
<i>Your courage soon will follow.</i>

376
00:56:32.598 --> 00:56:36.077
<i>So be strong tonight.</i>

377
00:56:39.605 --> 00:56:42.128
<i>Remember who you are.</i>

378
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:57.830
<i>Yeah.</i>

379
00:56:57.831 --> 00:57:01.777
<i>You're a soldier now.</i>

380
00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:05.944
<i>Fighting in a battle.</i>

381
00:57:06.465 --> 00:57:09.785
<i>To be free once more.</i>

382
00:57:11.386 --> 00:57:16.208
<i>Yeah, that's worth fighting for</i>

383
00:57:23.315 --> 00:57:26.025
Come on. Come on now.
It'll be all right.

384
00:57:26.026 --> 00:57:28.903
Come on. That's it. That's it.

385
00:57:46.004 --> 00:57:47.254
Let's go!

386
00:57:47.255 --> 00:57:48.948
Come on!

387
00:57:52.803 --> 00:57:55.596
<i>I didn't know why
we were brought here.</i>

388
00:57:55.597 --> 00:57:57.056
<i>What I did know</i>

389
00:57:57.057 --> 00:58:00.912
<i>was we had to find a way to
escape and get back home.</i>

390
00:58:01.353 --> 00:58:02.436
Clear!

391
00:58:07.234 --> 00:58:09.944
- No good! We hit bedrock!
- That's it.

392
00:58:09.945 --> 00:58:11.862
We're hauling the steamer
over the mountain.

393
00:58:11.863 --> 00:58:13.072
That's crazy.

394
00:58:13.073 --> 00:58:15.533
We got six days to
connect with Utah.

395
00:58:15.534 --> 00:58:17.682
We move out at dawn.

396
00:58:48.442 --> 00:58:50.109
Ready to go!

397
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:51.235
Hyah!

398
00:58:51.236 --> 00:58:52.737
Move it out!

399
00:58:56.825 --> 00:58:58.472
Move it out!

400
00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:16.802
Hyah!

401
00:59:18.305 --> 00:59:19.388
Whoa!

402
00:59:20.682 --> 00:59:22.725
Get back in line!

403
00:59:39.076 --> 00:59:40.701
We're almost at the top!

404
00:59:40.702 --> 00:59:42.679
Slow down up front!

405
01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:04.433
<i>That was the moment I understood.</i>

406
01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:07.629
<i>They were headed to my homeland,
and I had to stop them.</i>

407
01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.359
Get back!

408
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.944
Come on! Get back in line!

409
01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.342
It's starting to slip!

410
01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:18.132
Whoa! Pick up the slack!

411
01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:20.350
Pick up the slack!

412
01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:25.305
Hold it!

413
01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:34.572
Get the mules up here!

414
01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:45.996
Secure it on the left!

415
01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:49.166
Good work, boys!

416
01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:57.636
Hey!

417
01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:00.341
Whoa!

418
01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:02.175
Easy...

419
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.022
Get him. Get him.

420
01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:13.752
Whoa!

421
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.086
Hurry! Bring the poles!

422
01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:41.222
Hurry!

423
01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:45.222
- Hold him there!
- Go!

424
01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.170
They're breaking! I can't hold it!

425
01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:57.397
Over here!

426
01:01:57.923 --> 01:01:59.240
Get out of the way!

427
01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.099
Holy...

428
01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:51.095
<i>I don't know where he
came from or how he got there</i>

429
01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:53.745
<i>but I sure was happy to see him.</i>

430
01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:21.959
Whoo-hoo!

431
01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.090
Ah, ah!

432
01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:29.283
Oh!

433
01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:37.534
I knew I would find you.

434
01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:51.180
Halt!

435
01:05:58.538 --> 01:06:00.581
I don't believe it.

436
01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:04.690
Go, go, go, go! Run! Run!

437
01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:08.656
Come on, come on!

438
01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:35.741
Whoo-hoo!

439
01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:03.870
Hyah!

440
01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:11.548
Yeah!

441
01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:22.890
Whoa!

442
01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.563
That's it! Come on! Come on!

443
01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:44.643
Get off!

444
01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.464
Ooh! Aah!

445
01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:02.099
Whoa!

446
01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:06.937
Hyah!

447
01:08:10.169 --> 01:08:11.612
We got them now!

448
01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.316
Where did he go?

449
01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.360
There they are! Up there!

450
01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.512
Oh, no.

451
01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:48.141
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

452
01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.285
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh.</i>

453
01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:25.387
<i>Don't judge a thing
Till you know what's inside it.</i>

454
01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:27.806
<i>Don't push me, I'll fight it.</i>

455
01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:31.476
<i>Never gonna give it
Never gonna give it up, no.</i>

456
01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:32.728
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh.</i>

457
01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:36.648
<i>Ah, if you can't catch a wave
Then you're never gonna ride it.</i>

458
01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:39.401
<i>Can't come uninvited.</i>

459
01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:43.348
<i>Never gonna give it
Never gonna give it up, no</i>

460
01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:47.325
<i>You can't take me.</i>

461
01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:50.600
<i>I'm free.</i>

462
01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:54.499
<i>Yeah, I'm free.</i>

463
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.102
<i>Yeah...</i>

464
01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:59.068
<i>Yeah...</i>

465
01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.991
<i>Yeah...</i>

466
01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.819
<i>Yeah...</i>

467
01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:38.337
You will always be in my heart.

468
01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:59.317
Take care of her,
Spirit-who-could-not-be-broken.

469
01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:21.756
I will miss you, my friend.

470
01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:41.476
<i>I had been waiting
so long to run free</i>

471
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:46.281
<i>but that good-bye was harder
than I ever imagined.</i>

472
01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.757
<i>I'll never forget that boy...</i>

473
01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:52.279
<i>And how we won back
our freedom together.</i>

474
01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:03.123
<i>I hear the wind.</i>

475
01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:05.857
<i>Call my name</i>

476
01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:14.054
<i>The sound that leads me home again.</i>

477
01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:17.728
<i>It sparks up the fire.</i>

478
01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:22.021
<i>A flame that still burns.</i>

479
01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:26.980
<i>To you I will always return.</i>

480
01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:32.717
<i>I know the road is long.</i>

481
01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:37.039
<i>But where you are is home.</i>

482
01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:40.167
<i>Wherever you stay.</i>

483
01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:44.338
<i>I'll find the way.</i>

484
01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:48.400
<i>I'll run like the river.</i>

485
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:50.845
<i>I'll follow the sun.</i>

486
01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:56.017
<i>I'll fly like an eagle.</i>

487
01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:59.619
<i>To where I belong.</i>

488
01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.394
<i>I can't stand the distance.</i>

489
01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:07.127
<i>I can't dream alone.</i>

490
01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:10.880
<i>I can't wait to see you.</i>

491
01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:14.634
<i>Yes, I'm on my way home.</i>

492
01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:17.846
<i>Now I know it's true.</i>

493
01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:21.827
<i>My every road leads to you.</i>

494
01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:25.588
<i>And in the hour of darkness.</i>

495
01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:31.568
<i>Your light gets me through.</i>

496
01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:35.048
<i>You run like the river.</i>

497
01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:39.060
<i>You shine like the sun.</i>

498
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:40.910
<i>Yeah.</i>

499
01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:44.539
<i>You fly like an eagle.</i>

500
01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.395
<i>Yeah, you are the one.</i>

501
01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:53.757
<i>I've seen every sunset.</i>

502
01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:57.988
<i>And with all that I've learned.</i>

503
01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:00.972
<i>Oh...</i>

504
01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:05.374
<i>It's to you I will always.</i>

505
01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:10.841
<i>Always return</i>

506
01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:27.624
<i>Here I am.</i>

507
01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:29.751
<i>This is me.</i>

508
01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:34.198
<i>There's nowhere else on
Earth I 'd rather be.</i>

509
01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:36.841
<i>Here I am.</i>

510
01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:39.036
<i>It's just me and you.</i>

511
01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:44.015
<i>Tonight we make
Our dreams come true.</i>

512
01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.476
<i>It's a new world.</i>

513
01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:48.812
<i>It's a new start.</i>

514
01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:53.691
<i>It's alive with the beating
Of young hearts.</i>

515
01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:56.111
<i>It's a new day.</i>

516
01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:58.571
<i>It's a new plan.</i>

517
01:16:58.572 --> 01:17:02.017
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>

518
01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:04.811
<i>Here I am.</i>

519
01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:09.816
<i>Here I am.</i>

520
01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:22.887
<i>Here we are.</i>

521
01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:25.181
<i>We've just begun.</i>

522
01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:29.644
<i>And after all this time
Our time has come.</i>

523
01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.498
<i>Yeah, here we are.</i>

524
01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:35.066
<i>Still going strong.</i>

525
01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:38.888
<i>Right here in the
place where we belong.</i>

526
01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:42.157
<i>It's a new world.</i>

527
01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:44.242
<i>It's a new start.</i>

528
01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:49.372
<i>It's alive with the beating
Of young hearts.</i>

529
01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:51.583
<i>It's a new day.</i>

530
01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:54.002
<i>It's a new plan.</i>

531
01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:56.856
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>

532
01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:59.700
<i>Waiting, waiting, waiting.</i>

533
01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:02.782
<i>Here I am.</i>

534
01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:05.763
<i>Baby, here I am.</i>

535
01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:07.182
<i>Here I am.</i>

536
01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:09.893
<i>Here I am
Here I am.</i>

537
01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:12.061
<i>Right next to you.</i>

538
01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:14.022
<i>Right next to you.</i>

539

548
01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:44.578
<i>It's so incredible that we're alone.</i>

549
01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:48.370
<i>There's so much to be said and done.</i>

550
01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:53.478

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:07.825
<i>Never let it.</i>

557
01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:10.787
<i>Never let it go.</i>

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:26.780
<i>Go of this moment in time.</i>

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:31.997
<i>Don't let go...</i>

563
01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:35.520

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:41.094
<i>No, don't let go...</i>

565
01:19:43.988 --> 01:19:46.155
<i>I've been waiting all my life.</i>

566
01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:48.032
<i>All my life.</i>

567
01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:49.867
<i>To make this moment feel so right.</i>

568
01:19:49.868 --> 01:19:52.370
<i>Feel so right.</i>

569
01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:56.582
<i>The feel of you just
fills the night.</i>

570
01:19:56.583 --> 01:20:01.234
<i>So, come on let's
just hold on tight.</i>

571
01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:06.259
<i>Don't let go...</i>

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:28.698
<i>No, don't let...</i>

578
01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:31.492
<i>No, I won't let.</i>

579
01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.641
<i>Go.</i>

580
01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:41.312
<i>No, don't let go...</i>

581
01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:50.038
<i>No, I won't let go</i>

582
01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:58.329
<i>I had a dream.</i>

583
01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:02.883
<i>Of the wide-open prairie.</i>

584
01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:09.803
<i>I had a dream.</i>

585
01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:14.303
<i>Of the pale morning sky.</i>

586
01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:21.227
<i>I had a dream.</i>

587
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:28.276
<i>That we flew on golden wings.</i>

588
01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:31.867
<i>And we were the same.</i>

589
01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.639
<i>Just the same.</i>

590
01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.913
<i>You and I.</i>

591
01:21:41.438 --> 01:21:43.836
<i>Follow your heart.</i>

592
01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:48.550
<i>Little child of the west wind.</i>

593
01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:55.428
<i>Follow the voice.</i>

594
01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:59.936
<i>That's calling you home.</i>

595
01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:07.189
<i>Follow your dreams.</i>

596
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:13.662
<i>But always remember</i> me.

597
01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:16.957
<i>I am your brother.</i>

598
01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:22.622
<i>Yeah, under the sun.</i>

599
01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:29.344
<i>We are.</i>

600
01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:32.635
<i>Like birds of a feather.</i>

601
01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:34.971
<i>We are.</i>

602
01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:38.141
<i>Two hearts joined together.</i>

603
01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:42.183
<i>We will be.</i>

604
01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:45.436
<i>Forever as one.</i>

605
01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:50.692
<i>My brother, under the sun.</i>

606
01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:56.663
<i>Under the sun.</i>

607
01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:02.415
<i>Under the sun.</i>

608
01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:13.840
<i>My brother, under the sun</i>
