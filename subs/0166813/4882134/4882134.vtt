1
00:01:43.223 --> 00:01:44.735
The story that I want to tell you

2
00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:47.373
cannot be found in a book.

3
00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:48.938
They say the history of the West

4
00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.680
was written from the saddle of a horse

5
00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:54.881
but it's never been told
from the heart of one...

6
00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:56.645
not till now.

7
00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:00.065
I was born here

8
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:03.556
in this place that would come
to be called the Old West

9
00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:06.693
but to my kind,
the land was ageless.

10
00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:09.158
It had no beginning
and no end...

11
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.965
no boundary
between earth and sky.

12
00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.602
Like the wind
in the buffalo grass

13
00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:17.336
we belonged here.

14
00:02:17.594 --> 00:02:20.168
We would always belong here.

15
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:25.344
They say the mustang
is the spirit of the West.

16
00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:28.247
Whether that West was won
or lost in the end

17
00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:31.342
you'll have to decide for yourself

18
00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:34.512
but the story
I want to tell you is true.

19
00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:38.684
I was there, and I remember.

20
00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:40.724
I remember the sun and the sky

21
00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:42.525
and the wind calling my name

22
00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:45.190
in a time when wild horses ran free.

23
00:04:33.634 --> 00:04:36.309
(music) Here I am (music)

24
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.878
(music) This is me (music)

25
00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:44.146
(music) I come into this world
so wild and free (music)

26
00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:47.099
(music) Here I am (music)

27
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.586
(music) So young and strong (music)

28
00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:55.272
(music) Right here in the place
where I belong (music)

29
00:04:55.273 --> 00:04:57.965
(music) It's a new world (music)

30
00:04:57.966 --> 00:05:00.633
(music) It's a new start (music)

31
00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:06.339
(music) It's alive with the beating
of a young heart (music)

32
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.191
(music) It's a new day (music)

33
00:05:09.192 --> 00:05:11.577
(music) In a new land (music)

34
00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:15.783
(music) And it's waiting for me (music)

35
00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:19.889
(music) Here I am (music)

36
00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:25.204
(music) Oh, it's a new world (music)

37
00:05:25.205 --> 00:05:28.267
(music) It's a new start (music)

38
00:05:28.268 --> 00:05:33.357
(music) It's alive with the beating
of a young heart (music)

39
00:05:33.358 --> 00:05:36.521
(music) Yeah, it's a new day (music)

40
00:05:36.522 --> 00:05:39.168
(music) In a new land (music)

41
00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.355
(music) And it's waiting for me (music)

42
00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:47.027
(music) Here I am (music)

43
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.518
And so I grew from colt to stallion

44
00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:35.647
as wild and reckless
as thunder over the land

45
00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:39.348
racing with the eagle,
soaring with the wind.

46
00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:40.492
Flying?

47
00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:42.928
There were times I believed I could.

48
00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:15.447
Like my father before me

49
00:08:15.448 --> 00:08:18.249
I became leader
of the Cimarron herd

50
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.133
and with that honor...
came responsibility.

51
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:34.110
(music) I hear the wind across the plain (music)

52
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:41.595
(music) A sound so strong that calls my name (music)

53
00:09:41.596 --> 00:09:45.366
(music) It's wild like the river (music)

54
00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:48.699
(music) It's warm like the sun (music)

55
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.524
(music) Yeah, it's here (music)

56
00:09:50.525 --> 00:09:55.174
(music) This is where I belong (music)

57
00:09:56.649 --> 00:10:00.139
(music) Under the starry skies (music)

58
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.117
(music) Where eagles have flown (music)

59
00:10:04.118 --> 00:10:07.534
(music) This place is paradise (music)

60
00:10:07.535 --> 00:10:11.356
(music) It's the place I call home (music)

61
00:10:11.357 --> 00:10:14.905
CHORUS:
(music) The moon on the mountains (music)

62
00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:18.739
(music) The whisper through the trees (music)

63
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.139
(music) The waves on the water (music)

64
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.587
(music) Let nothing come
between this and me (music)

65
00:10:25.588 --> 00:10:29.242
(music) 'Cause everything I want (music)

66
00:10:29.243 --> 00:10:33.523
(music) Is everything that's here (music)

67
00:10:33.524 --> 00:10:37.280
(music) And when we're all together (music)

68
00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:42.836
(music) There's nothing to fear (music)

69
00:10:43.317 --> 00:10:46.865
(music) Ooh, ooh (music)

70
00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:50.574
(music) Ooh, ooh, ooh (music)

71
00:10:50.575 --> 00:10:57.927
(music) Ooh, ooh, ooh... (music)

72
00:10:59.322 --> 00:11:03.260
(music) And wherever I wander (music)

73
00:11:03.261 --> 00:11:07.875
(music) The one thing I've learned (music)

74
00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.213
(music) Yeah (music)

75
00:11:10.214 --> 00:11:14.761
(music) It's to here I will always (music)

76
00:11:14.762 --> 00:11:20.126
(music) Always... (music)

77
00:11:20.127 --> 00:11:22.906
(music) Return (music)

78
00:12:03.308 --> 00:12:06.325
Something new came
upon the land one night...

79
00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:09.661
something that would
change my life forever...

80
00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:13.928
and so, my journey began.

81
00:13:10.323 --> 00:13:13.792
A wiser horse might have
turned and run

82
00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.819
but I wanted to know
what strange creatures were here.

83
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.752
Oh!

84
00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:49.886
What the...?

85
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.119
Son of a...!

86
00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:53.130
Shh...

87
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:55.360
Look.

88
00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.537
Man, look at that stallion!

89
00:13:58.538 --> 00:13:59.798
It's beautiful!

90
00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:21.488
Mmm, Sadie Mae.

91
00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:25.596
Ugh!

92
00:14:28.472 --> 00:14:30.325
Get him, boys!

93
00:14:30.326 --> 00:14:32.062
Easy, boy!

94
00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:36.575
C'mon, boys! Let's go!

95
00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:38.409
C'mon, boys!

96
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:51.588
Hyah! Hyah!

97
00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:54.821
Hyah! Hyah!

98
00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:58.197
Where did he go?
I don't see him.

99
00:14:58.198 --> 00:14:59.888
We'll find him!

100
00:15:09.295 --> 00:15:10.267
What the...?

101
00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:45.844
Faster!

102
00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:01.689
What?

103
00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:06.064
Get him!

104
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.032
Ha! Come on! Ha!

105
00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:09.329
Ha! Get him!

106
00:16:14.255 --> 00:16:15.573
Hyah! Yah! Yah!

107
00:16:16.513 --> 00:16:18.303
Come on, come on, come on!

108
00:16:25.852 --> 00:16:27.343
Ha-ha! We got him now!

109
00:16:27.344 --> 00:16:28.847
Ha-ha, you betcha!

110
00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:32.321
Whoa!

111
00:16:36.396 --> 00:16:38.063
Look out!

112
00:16:38.064 --> 00:16:38.755
Whoa!

113
00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:03.602
Thought you got away,
didn't you, mustang?

114
00:17:07.465 --> 00:17:08.074
Over here!

115
00:17:08.075 --> 00:17:09.414
Get back here!
You crazy?

116
00:17:09.652 --> 00:17:11.175
Get back from him!

117
00:17:11.176 --> 00:17:12.532
Take him!
Take him, Joe!

118
00:17:12.533 --> 00:17:14.966
Get the horse!

119
00:17:15.735 --> 00:17:17.217
He's ours now.

120
00:17:17.218 --> 00:17:17.793
Whoo!

121
00:17:22.596 --> 00:17:23.759
Hold him!

122
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.299
Watch him!

123
00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:28.006
Watch the lines!
Watch the lines!

124
00:17:28.353 --> 00:17:29.069
Come on!

125
00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.061
He can do all the kicking
he wants now.

126
00:17:31.062 --> 00:17:32.846
It won't do no good.

127
00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.711
Careful... Careful...

128
00:18:04.403 --> 00:18:05.752
I was scared,

129
00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:08.209
and I didn't know
what was going to happen to me

130
00:18:08.621 --> 00:18:11.517
but at least my mother
and the herd were safe.

131
00:18:15.034 --> 00:18:16.749
Come on! Let's go!

132
00:18:18.046 --> 00:18:19.667
Yo... come on...

133
00:18:20.298 --> 00:18:23.168
(music) Gotta fight another fight (music)

134
00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:26.277
(music) I gotta run another night (music)

135
00:18:26.278 --> 00:18:29.097
(music) Get it out, check it out (music)

136
00:18:29.098 --> 00:18:32.323
(music) I'm on my way
and it don't feel right (music)

137
00:18:32.324 --> 00:18:34.876
(music) I gotta get me back (music)

138
00:18:34.877 --> 00:18:38.234
(music) I can't be beat, and that's a fact (music)

139
00:18:38.235 --> 00:18:40.918
(music) It's okay, I'll find a way (music)

140
00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:43.906
(music) Ain't gonna take me down, no way (music)

141
00:18:43.907 --> 00:18:47.018
(music) No, oh, oh, oh (music)

142
00:18:47.019 --> 00:18:50.310
(music) Yeah, don't judge a thing
till you know what's inside it (music)

143
00:18:50.311 --> 00:18:52.922
(music) Don't push me, I'll fight it (music)

144
00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:56.207
(music) Never gonna give in,
never gonna give it up, no (music)

145
00:18:56.208 --> 00:18:58.516
(music) No, oh, oh, oh (music)

146
00:18:58.517 --> 00:19:02.171
(music) If you can't catch a wave then
you're never gonna ride it (music)

147
00:19:02.172 --> 00:19:04.926
(music) You can't come uninvited (music)

148
00:19:04.927 --> 00:19:09.271
(music) Never gonna give in,
never gonna give it up, no (music)

149
00:19:11.036 --> 00:19:15.821
(music) You can't take me, I'm free (music)

150
00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:29.144
(music) Why did it all go wrong? (music)

151
00:19:29.145 --> 00:19:32.205
(music) I want to know what's going on (music)

152
00:19:32.206 --> 00:19:35.106
(music) What's this holding me? (music)

153
00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:38.130
(music) I'm not where I'm supposed to be (music)

154
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:41.135
(music) I gotta fight another fight (music)

155
00:19:41.136 --> 00:19:43.891
(music) I gotta fight with all my might (music)

156
00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:46.975
(music) I'm getting out, so check it out (music)

157
00:19:46.976 --> 00:19:49.981
(music) You're in my way, yeah,
you better watch out... (music)

158
00:19:49.982 --> 00:19:52.175
Open the gate!

159
00:19:52.176 --> 00:19:53.092
(music) Come on! (music)

160
00:19:53.093 --> 00:19:56.256
Don't judge a thing
till you know what's inside it (music)

161
00:19:56.257 --> 00:19:58.977
(music) Don't push me, I'll fight it (music)

162
00:19:58.978 --> 00:20:01.991
(music) Never gonna give in,
never gonna give it up, no (music)

163
00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:04.527
(music) No, oh, oh, oh (music)

164
00:20:04.528 --> 00:20:08.073
(music) If you can't catch a wave
then you're never gonna ride it (music)

165
00:20:08.074 --> 00:20:10.985
(music) You can't come uninvited (music)

166
00:20:10.986 --> 00:20:15.100
(music) Never gonna give in,
never gonna give it up, no (music)

167
00:20:17.022 --> 00:20:19.172
(music) You can't take me, I'm free (music)

168
00:20:19.173 --> 00:20:26.920
(music) I'm free (music)

169
00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.361
What seems to be the problem,
gentlemen?

170
00:20:41.362 --> 00:20:43.197
We got us a crazy one here, sir.

171
00:20:43.198 --> 00:20:44.710
Pure mustang, Colonel.

172
00:20:44.711 --> 00:20:45.815
Really?

173
00:20:50.016 --> 00:20:52.267
The Army has dealt
with wild horses before.

174
00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.407
This one will be no different.

175
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.137
SOLDIER:
Come on, mustang.

176
00:20:58.847 --> 00:21:00.365
I remember the first time

177
00:21:00.366 --> 00:21:03.151
I saw a rattler
curled up in my path.

178
00:21:04.297 --> 00:21:06.082
Induct this animal, Sergeant.

179
00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:08.634
- Yes, sir!
- This one didn't look like a rattler

180
00:21:08.635 --> 00:21:11.312
but I was still thinking... snake.

181
00:21:11.313 --> 00:21:12.320
Take up that slack.

182
00:21:12.321 --> 00:21:14.263
Grab him! Grab him!

183
00:21:14.602 --> 00:21:16.689
Come on, horse!

184
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.078
Okay, Murphy, he's all yours.

185
00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:22.739
Whoa! He's a wild one.

186
00:21:23.983 --> 00:21:26.218
We'll see how wild he is
when I'm done with him.

187
00:21:31.424 --> 00:21:32.184
See that?

188
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.968
You want to fight, do you?

189
00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.299
Right.

190
00:22:12.766 --> 00:22:14.542
Make sure that's good and tight.

191
00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.798
- Murphy, look out!
- Watch out!

192
00:22:24.478 --> 00:22:25.817
He's a wild one.

193
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.552
You all right, Murph?

194
00:22:43.763 --> 00:22:45.860
Eh-heh... you...

195
00:23:00.646 --> 00:23:02.038
Murph, you okay?

196
00:23:04.517 --> 00:23:08.291
Um... Corporal, round up
some volunteers to, uh...

197
00:23:08.777 --> 00:23:10.483
take this animal to the stables.

198
00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:12.424
Not the stables.

199
00:23:12.425 --> 00:23:13.325
Sir?

200
00:23:13.326 --> 00:23:14.536
The corral.

201
00:23:14.961 --> 00:23:17.789
It's time to break that horse.

202
00:23:20.842 --> 00:23:23.934
(music) Well, you think
that you can take me on (music)

203
00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:26.184
(music) You must be crazy... (music)

204
00:23:26.185 --> 00:23:27.907
OFFICER:
Make sure it's good and tight.

205
00:23:28.708 --> 00:23:31.766
(music) There ain't a single thing
you've done (music)

206
00:23:31.767 --> 00:23:34.904
(music) That's gonna faze me (music)

207
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:40.835
(music) Oh, but if you want to have a go (music)

208
00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:44.948
(music) I just want to let you know (music)

209
00:23:44.949 --> 00:23:49.480
(music) Yeah, get off of my back
and into my game (music)

210
00:23:49.481 --> 00:23:53.413
(music) Get out of my way
'cause I'm wild and untamed (music)

211
00:23:53.414 --> 00:23:58.304
(music) Get out of my face
or give it your best shot (music)

212
00:23:58.305 --> 00:24:01.139
(music) I think it's time
you better face the fact (music)

213
00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.509
(music) Get off of my back... (music)

214
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.168
Okay, my turn!

215
00:24:10.976 --> 00:24:14.122
(music) You know it's all just a game (music)

216
00:24:14.123 --> 00:24:16.765
(music) That I'm playin' (music)

217
00:24:18.768 --> 00:24:21.011
(music) Don't think that
you can find a way in... (music)

218
00:24:21.012 --> 00:24:21.877
Lousy heap of horse flesh!

219
00:24:21.878 --> 00:24:23.892
(music) That's what I'm sayin'... (music)

220
00:24:25.014 --> 00:24:26.301
Come on!
Run out of there!

221
00:24:26.302 --> 00:24:30.883
(music) Oh, now, if you want to have a go (music)

222
00:24:30.884 --> 00:24:35.112
(music) I just want to let you know (music)

223
00:24:35.113 --> 00:24:39.531
(music) Oh, get off of my back
And into my game (music)

224
00:24:39.532 --> 00:24:43.344
(music) Get out of my face,
'cause I'm wild and untamed (music)

225
00:24:43.345 --> 00:24:47.199
(music) Get out of my way,
or give it your best shot... (music)

226
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.424
Hey, we got a rider!

227
00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:51.265
(music) But you know
this train is comin' off this track (music)

228
00:24:51.266 --> 00:24:53.318
(music) Get off of my back (music)

229
00:24:54.622 --> 00:24:58.582
(music) Yeah, get off of my back (music)

230
00:24:58.583 --> 00:25:00.131
(music) Get off (music)

231
00:25:03.975 --> 00:25:07.991
(music) Get off, get off, get off, get off (music)

232
00:25:07.992 --> 00:25:10.909
(music) Get off, get off, get off (music)

233
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.105
(music) Get off of my back (music)

234
00:25:18.784 --> 00:25:19.794
Sergeant!

235
00:25:20.042 --> 00:25:22.511
- Yes, sir.
- Tie this horse to the post.

236
00:25:23.022 --> 00:25:24.739
No food or water.

237
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.890
Three days.

238
00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:27.988
Yes, sir.

239
00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:26.617
My heart galloped
through the skies that night...

240
00:26:26.618 --> 00:26:31.122
back to my herd,
where I belonged

241
00:26:31.123 --> 00:26:35.526
and I wondered if they missed me
as much as I missed them.

242
00:27:03.022 --> 00:27:05.354
Get some water over to the stable.

243
00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:09.189
Yes, sir.

244
00:27:29.093 --> 00:27:30.723
We caught a hostile!

245
00:27:36.623 --> 00:27:38.498
Bring him back this way!

246
00:27:44.564 --> 00:27:46.791
Well, what do we have here?

247
00:27:47.717 --> 00:27:49.931
We caught him
by the supply wagons, sir.

248
00:27:52.371 --> 00:27:54.635
Ah, a Lakota.

249
00:27:54.706 --> 00:27:56.208
Not as tall as the Cheyenne;

250
00:27:56.209 --> 00:27:58.215
not as fine-featured as the Crow.

251
00:27:58.275 --> 00:28:00.846
Take him away, gentlemen.
Show him our best.

252
00:28:00.847 --> 00:28:02.700
Corporal, take him to the stockades.

253
00:28:02.701 --> 00:28:05.536
Not the stockades... the post.

254
00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:07.473
No food or water.

255
00:28:13.792 --> 00:28:14.738
Come on!

256
00:28:16.896 --> 00:28:18.423
What are you looking at, boy?

257
00:28:20.499 --> 00:28:22.500
He was called Little Creek

258
00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:24.196
and he seemed different
from the rest.

259
00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:41.618
Hey...

260
00:29:19.258 --> 00:29:20.772
There was just no end

261
00:29:20.773 --> 00:29:23.620
to the strange ways
of the Two-leggeds.

262
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.703
C Company! Ten-hut!

263
00:29:41.982 --> 00:29:43.682
With the Colonel's permission, sir.

264
00:29:43.683 --> 00:29:46.484
Incoming patrol reports
hostiles headed north.

265
00:29:46.485 --> 00:29:46.956
Ah.

266
00:29:46.957 --> 00:29:49.336
The railroad has expressed concern, sir.

267
00:29:49.571 --> 00:29:51.956
They've requested additional patrols.

268
00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:53.975
How long has it been, Sergeant?

269
00:29:53.976 --> 00:29:54.738
Sir?

270
00:29:54.739 --> 00:29:57.811
The mustang,
how long has it been tied?

271
00:29:57.812 --> 00:29:59.698
Three days, sir.

272
00:29:59.699 --> 00:30:03.187
Good.
Fetch my crop and spurs.

273
00:30:21.787 --> 00:30:24.309
You can break easy
or you can break hard, mustang!

274
00:30:25.524 --> 00:30:25.948
No!

275
00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:27.289
Back up! Back up!

276
00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:28.301
Back up!

277
00:30:32.565 --> 00:30:33.135
Come on!

278
00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:37.414
Come on!

279
00:30:40.035 --> 00:30:41.129
Come on... come on...!

280
00:30:42.432 --> 00:30:43.338
Come on, mustang!

281
00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:26.779
You see, gentlemen...

282
00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.781
any horse can be broken.

283
00:31:31.635 --> 00:31:33.230
Move along, mustang.

284
00:31:36.802 --> 00:31:38.335
There are those in Washington

285
00:31:38.336 --> 00:31:40.883
who believe the West
will never be settled,

286
00:31:42.118 --> 00:31:43.747
the Northern Pacific Railroad

287
00:31:43.748 --> 00:31:45.129
will never breach Nebraska...

288
00:31:49.238 --> 00:31:50.803
A hostile Lakota...

289
00:31:52.016 --> 00:31:54.191
will never submit to Providence...

290
00:31:56.857 --> 00:31:59.560
and it is that manner
of small thinking

291
00:31:59.561 --> 00:32:03.554
that would say this horse
could never be broken.

292
00:32:03.555 --> 00:32:07.889
Discipline, time and patience...

293
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:10.657
are the three great levelers.

294
00:32:15.295 --> 00:32:18.035
Sometimes a horse has gotta do
what a horse has gotta do.

295
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:19.203
Mustang?

296
00:32:19.204 --> 00:32:21.299
And this was one of those times.

297
00:32:42.995 --> 00:32:44.157
Oh, no!

298
00:32:49.502 --> 00:32:52.393
You all right, sir?

299
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.077
Get off me!

300
00:33:25.604 --> 00:33:28.268
Soldier... secure that horse!

301
00:34:35.155 --> 00:34:37.575
I wasn't sure what happened back there

302
00:34:37.576 --> 00:34:40.311
and I wasn't about to stop and ask.

303
00:34:40.312 --> 00:34:44.573
All I knew was
that I was headed home.

304
00:35:07.973 --> 00:35:09.441
I couldn't believe it.

305
00:35:09.442 --> 00:35:13.818
One moment I was free,
and the next... more ropes.

306
00:35:46.678 --> 00:35:48.714
Steady. Steady.

307
00:35:49.653 --> 00:35:51.305
I'm not going to hurt you.

308
00:35:54.226 --> 00:35:55.278
Nice and easy.

309
00:36:03.096 --> 00:36:04.485
There you go.

310
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.299
That feels better now, doesn't it?

311
00:37:24.404 --> 00:37:26.005
Hey, hey!

312
00:37:47.104 --> 00:37:48.389
I couldn't understand it.

313
00:37:49.174 --> 00:37:52.905
She treated this scrawny
Two-legged like one of our kind

314
00:37:52.906 --> 00:37:56.014
prancing around him
like a love-struck yearling.

315
00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:58.402
It was downright unnatural.

316
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.313
Great mustang...

317
00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:10.120
today I will ride you.

318
00:38:13.425 --> 00:38:14.773
This ought to be good.

319
00:38:39.818 --> 00:38:40.907
Mares!

320
00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.537
Okay, Rain,

321
00:38:48.538 --> 00:38:51.825
let's see if you can teach
this mustang some manners.

322
00:40:06.908 --> 00:40:10.389
Okay, I admit it, she was charming...

323
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.344
in a stubborn, irritating kind of way.

324
00:40:13.345 --> 00:40:16.159
So, I let her show me her world.

325
00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:11.226
Horsey!

326
00:41:38.129 --> 00:41:39.797
Bye-bye, horsey.

327
00:43:39.017 --> 00:43:44.483
For the first time in my life,
I felt my heart torn two ways.

328
00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:52.126
Hey, hey...

329
00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:53.897
No!

330
00:43:53.898 --> 00:43:55.233
Give it back!
Come on!

331
00:43:55.234 --> 00:43:57.932
Mustang, no! Mustang!

332
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:59.981
Oh, come on.

333
00:44:49.154 --> 00:44:51.257
I had to hand it to that boy...

334
00:44:51.258 --> 00:44:53.301
he just wouldn't give up.

335
00:45:42.828 --> 00:45:45.321
I'm never going to ride you, am I?

336
00:45:46.851 --> 00:45:48.893
And no one ever should.

337
00:46:15.073 --> 00:46:16.506
You can go.

338
00:46:21.779 --> 00:46:23.488
It's okay, go.

339
00:46:30.248 --> 00:46:32.004
Go on, get out of here!

340
00:46:33.825 --> 00:46:34.967
Go home.

341
00:47:40.491 --> 00:47:42.175
I knew this was hard for her

342
00:47:42.176 --> 00:47:43.960
and that she was scared

343
00:47:44.362 --> 00:47:46.271
but more than anything

344
00:47:46.272 --> 00:47:48.328
I wanted to share
my homeland with her.

345
00:51:43.501 --> 00:51:47.737
I lay beside her that night, hoping...

346
00:51:47.738 --> 00:51:50.819
praying that somehow
she would be okay.

347
00:51:53.711 --> 00:51:56.971
Hey! There's a couple
of horses over there.

348
00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:25.408
Leave the mare.
She's not going to make it.

349
00:52:40.591 --> 00:52:41.926
Come on.

350
00:52:43.245 --> 00:52:44.156
Come on!

351
00:52:58.242 --> 00:52:59.400
Oh, Rain.

352
00:52:59.401 --> 00:53:01.035
Oh...

353
00:53:02.613 --> 00:53:04.169
Easy, girl.

354
00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:05.690
Easy.

355
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:08.511
It'll be okay.

356
00:53:13.755 --> 00:53:15.102
Come on.

357
00:53:22.854 --> 00:53:24.512
You saved my life.

358
00:53:26.871 --> 00:53:28.438
Two more men on that brace!

359
00:53:28.439 --> 00:53:30.650
Collins! Evans!

360
00:53:30.651 --> 00:53:31.921
Bring it down!

361
00:53:34.165 --> 00:53:35.745
Let's go!

362
00:53:35.746 --> 00:53:37.009
Jackson, hey!

363
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:38.480
Grab a hold of that end!

364
00:53:40.184 --> 00:53:40.808
Got it!

365
00:53:43.217 --> 00:53:44.907
This one's loaded.

366
00:53:53.497 --> 00:53:55.999
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Come on.

367
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.847
It's gonna be okay.

368
00:54:18.322 --> 00:54:21.286
(music) Sound the bugle now (music)

369
00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:25.360
(music) Play it just for me (music)

370
00:54:27.732 --> 00:54:30.035
(music) As the seasons change (music)

371
00:54:30.036 --> 00:54:35.371
(music) Remember how I used to be (music)

372
00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:38.436
(music) Now I can't go on (music)

373
00:54:39.641 --> 00:54:42.812
(music) I can't even start (music)

374
00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:46.949
(music) I've got nothing left (music)

375
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.711
(music) Just an empty heart (music)

376
00:54:52.723 --> 00:54:55.625
(music) I'm a soldier (music)

377
00:54:55.626 --> 00:54:59.997
(music) Wounded,
so I must give up the fight (music)

378
00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:04.787
(music) There's nothing more for me (music)

379
00:55:04.788 --> 00:55:07.597
(music) Lead me away (music)

380
00:55:12.176 --> 00:55:14.904
(music) Or leave me lying here (music)

381
00:55:30.261 --> 00:55:34.669
(music) Sound the bugle now (music)

382
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:37.370
(music) Tell them I don't care (music)

383
00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:41.504
(music) There's not a road I know (music)

384
00:55:41.505 --> 00:55:44.971
(music) That leads to anywhere (music)

385
00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:55.284
(music) Without a light,
I fear that I will stumble in the dark (music)

386
00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:58.173
(music) Lay right down (music)

387
00:55:58.174 --> 00:56:01.991
(music) Decide not to go on (music)

388
00:56:03.577 --> 00:56:07.063
(music) Then from on high (music)

389
00:56:07.064 --> 00:56:11.694
(music) Somewhere in the distance (music)

390
00:56:12.603 --> 00:56:15.376
(music) There's a voice that calls (music)

391
00:56:15.377 --> 00:56:19.412
(music) Remember who you are (music)

392
00:56:21.099 --> 00:56:25.784
(music) If you lose yourself (music)

393
00:56:25.785 --> 00:56:29.565
(music) Your courage soon will follow (music)

394
00:56:29.566 --> 00:56:33.688
(music) So be strong tonight (music)

395
00:56:36.452 --> 00:56:39.653
(music) Remember who you are (music)

396
00:56:52.409 --> 00:56:54.811
(music) Yeah (music)

397
00:56:54.812 --> 00:56:59.561
(music) You're a soldier now (music)

398
00:56:59.562 --> 00:57:03.253
(music) Fighting in a battle (music)

399
00:57:03.254 --> 00:57:08.324
(music) To be free once more (music)

400
00:57:08.325 --> 00:57:13.829
(music) Yeah, that's worth fighting for (music)

401
00:57:20.027 --> 00:57:20.828
Come on.

402
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:22.940
Come on now.
It'll be all right.

403
00:57:22.941 --> 00:57:23.938
Come on.

404
00:57:23.939 --> 00:57:25.893
That's it. That's it.

405
00:57:42.663 --> 00:57:43.819
Let's go!

406
00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:45.425
Come on!

407
00:57:49.959 --> 00:57:52.402
I didn't know why
we were brought here.

408
00:57:52.503 --> 00:57:53.803
What I did know

409
00:57:53.804 --> 00:57:57.966
was we had to find a way
to escape and get back home.

410
00:57:57.967 --> 00:57:58.687
Clear!

411
00:58:04.114 --> 00:58:05.072
No good!

412
00:58:05.073 --> 00:58:06.883
- We hit bedrock!
- Well, that's it.

413
00:58:06.884 --> 00:58:08.534
We're hauling the steamer
over the mountain.

414
00:58:08.535 --> 00:58:09.926
That's crazy.

415
00:58:09.927 --> 00:58:12.266
We got six days
to connect with Utah.

416
00:58:12.267 --> 00:58:14.270
We move out at dawn.

417
00:58:45.389 --> 00:58:46.866
Ready to go!

418
00:58:46.867 --> 00:58:47.983
Hyah!

419
00:58:47.984 --> 00:58:49.466
Move it out!

420
00:58:54.151 --> 00:58:55.275
Move it out!

421
00:59:12.767 --> 00:59:13.701
Hyah!

422
00:59:15.319 --> 00:59:16.311
Whoa!

423
00:59:17.755 --> 00:59:19.439
Get back in line!

424
00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:37.473
We're almost at the top!

425
00:59:37.474 --> 00:59:39.513
Slow down up front!

426
00:59:58.583 --> 01:00:01.297
That was the moment
I understood.

427
01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:04.341
They were headed to my homeland,
and I had to stop them.

428
01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:09.912
Get back!

429
01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:11.408
Come on! Get back in line!

430
01:00:11.409 --> 01:00:13.006
It's starting to slip!

431
01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:15.301
Whoa! Pick up the slack!

432
01:00:15.579 --> 01:00:17.240
Pick up the slack!

433
01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:22.077
Hold it!

434
01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:31.171
Get the mules up here!

435
01:00:41.806 --> 01:00:42.697
Secure it on the left!

436
01:00:44.542 --> 01:00:46.075
Good work, boys!

437
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:54.776
Hey!

438
01:00:55.974 --> 01:00:56.776
Whoa!

439
01:00:58.188 --> 01:00:58.907
Easy...

440
01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:04.726
Get him. Get him.

441
01:01:09.533 --> 01:01:10.206
Whoa!

442
01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:33.531
Hurry!

443
01:01:33.532 --> 01:01:34.725
Bring the poles!

444
01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:37.155
Hurry!

445
01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:40.990
Hey, hold him there!

446
01:01:40.991 --> 01:01:41.690
Go!

447
01:01:50.559 --> 01:01:51.610
They're breaking!

448
01:01:51.611 --> 01:01:52.916
I can't hold it!

449
01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:54.673
Over here!

450
01:01:54.674 --> 01:01:55.819
Get out of the way!

451
01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:29.788
Holy...!

452
01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:47.451
I don't know where he came from
or how he got there

453
01:04:47.816 --> 01:04:50.003
but I sure was happy to see him.

454
01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:25.020
Ah, ah!

455
01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:26.186
Oh!

456
01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:34.085
I knew I would find you.

457
01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:47.881
Halt!

458
01:05:55.723 --> 01:05:57.260
I don't believe it.

459
01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:00.094
Go, go, go, go! Run!

460
01:06:00.638 --> 01:06:01.401
Run!

461
01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:05.348
Come on, come on!

462
01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:32.651
Whoo-hoo!

463
01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:08.089
Yeah!

464
01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:10.174
Ah!

465
01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:25.607
That's it!
Come on! Come on!

466
01:07:39.902 --> 01:07:41.155
Get off!

467
01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.139
Whoa!

468
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:08.007
We got them now!

469
01:08:08.949 --> 01:08:09.701
Whoa!

470
01:08:09.702 --> 01:08:11.198
Where did he go?

471
01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:13.879
There they are!
Up there!

472
01:08:38.748 --> 01:08:40.167
Oh, no.

473
01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.131
Oh, yes.

474
01:10:12.008 --> 01:10:13.100
Hyah.

475
01:10:16.012 --> 01:10:18.998
(music) Whoa, oh, oh, oh (music)

476
01:10:18.999 --> 01:10:22.318
(music) Don't judge a thing
till you know what's inside it (music)

477
01:10:22.319 --> 01:10:24.920
(music) Don't push me, I'll fight it (music)

478
01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:27.857
(music) Never gonna give it,
never gonna give it up, no (music)

479
01:10:27.858 --> 01:10:29.658
(music) Whoa, oh, oh, oh (music)

480
01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:31.660
(music) Ah, if you can't catch a wave (music)

481
01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:33.762
(music) Then you're never gonna ride it (music)

482
01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:36.364
(music) Can't come uninvited (music)

483
01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:41.036
(music) Never gonna give it,
never gonna give it up, no (music)

484
01:10:42.172 --> 01:10:44.340
(music) You can't take me (music)

485
01:10:44.341 --> 01:10:48.478
(music) I'm free (music)

486
01:10:48.479 --> 01:10:51.480
(music) Yeah, I'm free (music)

487
01:10:51.481 --> 01:10:53.916
(music) Yeah... huh! (music)

488
01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:56.752
(music) Yeah... huh! (music)

(music) Yeah... huh! (music)

491
01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:35.133
You will always be in my heart.

492
01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:51.991
Take care of her

493
01:12:52.927 --> 01:12:56.365
Spirit-Who-Could-Not-Be-Broken.

494
01:13:16.268 --> 01:13:18.227
I will miss you, my friend.

495
01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:38.193
I had been waiting so long to run free

496
01:13:39.656 --> 01:13:43.389
but that good-bye
was harder than I ever imagined.

497
01:13:43.986 --> 01:13:46.069
I'll never forget that boy...

498
01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:48.987
And how we won back
our freedom together.

499
01:13:56.683 --> 01:14:00.485
(music) I hear the wind (music)

500
01:14:00.486 --> 01:14:04.040
(music) Call my name (music)

501
01:14:04.041 --> 01:14:11.613
(music) The sound that leads me home again (music)

502
01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:15.416
(music) It sparks up the fire (music)

503
01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:19.054
(music) A flame that still burns (music)

504
01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:25.984
(music) To you I will always return (music)

505
01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:29.731
(music) I know the road is long (music)

506
01:14:29.732 --> 01:14:34.069
(music) But where you are is home (music)

507
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:37.572
(music) Wherever you stay (music)

508
01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:41.743
(music) I'll find the way (music)

509
01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:45.480
(music) I'll run like the river (music)

510
01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:49.084
(music) I'll follow the sun (music)

511
01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:52.888
(music) I'll fly like an eagle (music)

512
01:14:52.889 --> 01:14:56.792
(music) To where I belong (music)

513
01:14:56.793 --> 01:15:00.529
(music) I can't stand the distance (music)

514
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:04.232
(music) I can't dream alone (music)

515
01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:07.736
(music) I can't wait to see you (music)

516
01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:11.309
(music) Yes, I'm on my way home (music)

517
01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:14.709
(music) Now I know it's true (music)

518
01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:19.047
(music) My every road leads to you (music)

519
01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:22.825
(music) And in the hour of darkness (music)

520
01:15:22.826 --> 01:15:28.490
(music) Your light gets me through (music)

521
01:15:28.491 --> 01:15:32.294
(music) You run like the river (music)

522
01:15:32.295 --> 01:15:36.231
(music) You shine like the sun (music)

523
01:15:36.232 --> 01:15:37.866
(music) Yeah (music)

524
01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:41.736
(music) You fly like an eagle (music)

525
01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:45.730
(music) Yeah, you are the one (music)

526
01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:50.912
(music) I've seen every sunset (music)

527
01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:56.084
(music) And with all that I've learned (music)

528
01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:58.086
(music) Oh... (music)

529
01:15:58.087 --> 01:16:02.657
(music) It's to you I will always (music)

530
01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:09.388
(music) Always return (music)

531
01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:24.613
BRYAN ADAMS:
(music) Here I am (music)

532
01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:26.748
(music) This is me (music)
