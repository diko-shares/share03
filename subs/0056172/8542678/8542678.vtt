1
00:07:55.018 --> 00:07:57.770
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.

2
00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:00.106
Did you know him well?

3
00:08:00.524 --> 00:08:01.941
I knew him.

4
00:08:03.485 --> 00:08:06.028
WeIl, nil nisi bonum.

5
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:08.239
But did he really deserve...

6
00:08:08.448 --> 00:08:10.741
...a place in here?

7
00:08:25.632 --> 00:08:28.551
Lord Allenby, could you give
a few words about Lawrence?

8
00:08:28.802 --> 00:08:30.803
What, more words?

9
00:08:32.556 --> 00:08:34.473
The revolt in the desert...

10
00:08:34.683 --> 00:08:38.352
...played a decisive part
in the Middle Eastern campaign.

11
00:08:38.645 --> 00:08:41.355
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.

12
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:45.985
No, no. I didn't know him well,
you know.

13
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.199
Mr. Bentley, you know as much
about Lawrence as anybody.

14
00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:55.161
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

15
00:08:55.412 --> 00:08:58.038
And to make him known to the world.

16
00:08:58.331 --> 00:09:02.668
He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.

17
00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:04.003
Thank you.

18
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:08.883
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

19
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:11.010
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:09:11.303 --> 00:09:13.512
My name is Jackson Bentley.

21
00:09:14.014 --> 00:09:17.892
I overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception.

22
00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:20.394
-He was a great man.
-Did you know him?

23
00:09:20.687 --> 00:09:22.688
No, I can't claim to have known him.

24
00:09:22.856 --> 00:09:25.357
I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

25
00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:27.234
Knew him? I never knew him.

26
00:09:27.527 --> 00:09:30.905
He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

27
00:09:50.717 --> 00:09:52.259
Michael George Hartley...

28
00:09:52.552 --> 00:09:55.846
...this is a nasty, dark little room.

29
00:09:56.056 --> 00:09:57.097
That's right.

30
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.558
We are not happy in it.

31
00:09:59.768 --> 00:10:03.646
I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark little trench.

32
00:10:03.897 --> 00:10:07.274
-Then you're a big noble fellow.
-That's right.

33
00:10:08.735 --> 00:10:12.488
Here is William Potter
with my newspaper.

34
00:10:12.906 --> 00:10:15.241
-Here you are, tosh.
-Thanks.

35
00:10:17.369 --> 00:10:20.412
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

36
00:10:21.957 --> 00:10:24.250
-Is it there?
-Of course.

37
00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:26.085
Headlines.

38
00:10:26.586 --> 00:10:29.797
But I bet it isn't mentioned
in the Times.

39
00:10:30.423 --> 00:10:34.802
"Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."

40
00:10:35.762 --> 00:10:39.431
I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.

41
00:10:39.683 --> 00:10:43.394
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

42
00:10:45.939 --> 00:10:47.940
-Mr. Lawrence?
-Yes.

43
00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:50.442
-Flimsy, sir.
-Thank you.

44
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.786
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.

45
00:11:01.037 --> 00:11:03.789
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

46
00:11:03.999 --> 00:11:05.916
And you're balmy!

47
00:11:20.015 --> 00:11:22.975
-It damn well hurts!
-Certainly, it hurts.

48
00:11:23.476 --> 00:11:25.060
What's the trick, then?

49
00:11:25.312 --> 00:11:29.356
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:32.568
By the way, if Captain Gibbon
should enquire for me...

51
00:11:32.819 --> 00:11:36.155
...tell him I've gone
for a chat with the general.

52
00:11:37.866 --> 00:11:40.075
-He's balmy.
-He's all right.

53
00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:47.499
Lawrence.

54
00:11:48.335 --> 00:11:49.501
Yes?

55
00:11:49.753 --> 00:11:51.545
You're supposed to be....

56
00:11:51.963 --> 00:11:54.340
Do you usually wear your cap
in the mess?

57
00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:56.258
Always.

58
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:58.677
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?

59
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.347
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.

60
00:12:01.556 --> 00:12:03.515
I'm going for a powwow
with the general.

61
00:12:03.725 --> 00:12:07.227
I'm not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.

62
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.897
We don't want chaps in here
who should be on duty.

63
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.607
Where are you going?

64
00:12:14.527 --> 00:12:16.362
I must say, Lawrence!

65
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:19.406
-Sorry.
-You're a clown, Lawrence.

66
00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:23.035
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

67
00:12:25.705 --> 00:12:26.705
Sorry.

68
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.541
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

69
00:12:29.709 --> 00:12:33.003
I do not propose to let
an overweening, crass lieutenant...

70
00:12:33.213 --> 00:12:36.715
...thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.

71
00:12:37.008 --> 00:12:40.219
It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss, sir.

72
00:12:40.637 --> 00:12:43.889
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.

73
00:12:44.099 --> 00:12:45.599
There is, indeed.

74
00:12:45.892 --> 00:12:47.768
He's of no use here in Cairo.

75
00:12:48.061 --> 00:12:51.105
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

76
00:12:51.398 --> 00:12:52.898
Knows the books, you mean.

77
00:12:53.066 --> 00:12:56.235
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

78
00:12:56.403 --> 00:12:59.238
If Brighton thinks we should send
some arms, we will.

79
00:13:01.449 --> 00:13:03.075
Well, what more do you want?

80
00:13:03.284 --> 00:13:06.412
That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...

81
00:13:06.621 --> 00:13:08.580
...giving military advice.

82
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.749
By God, I should hope not.

83
00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:15.504
It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot to....

84
00:13:15.672 --> 00:13:16.755
To what?

85
00:13:17.048 --> 00:13:19.466
To make our own appraisal
of the situation.

86
00:13:19.843 --> 00:13:23.762
I'll tell you, it's my considered
opinion and that of my staff...

87
00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:26.807
...that time spent on the Bedouin
will be time wasted.

88
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.435
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

89
00:13:29.644 --> 00:13:32.563
They did attack Medina.

90
00:13:32.772 --> 00:13:35.107
And the Turks made mincemeat
of them.

91
00:13:35.358 --> 00:13:36.692
We don't know that.

92
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.447
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

93
00:13:42.115 --> 00:13:46.118
In my opinion, this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow.

94
00:13:46.578 --> 00:13:49.705
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.

95
00:13:49.956 --> 00:13:52.791
Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.

96
00:13:53.001 --> 00:13:55.461
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itself...

97
00:13:55.628 --> 00:13:58.297
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

98
00:13:58.506 --> 00:14:01.133
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

99
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.596
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

100
00:14:05.805 --> 00:14:10.309
Does the bureau think they'll sit down
under us when this war is over?

101
00:14:10.518 --> 00:14:15.481
The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.

102
00:14:16.107 --> 00:14:18.358
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

103
00:14:19.235 --> 00:14:21.320
-Lawrence, sir.
-Send him in.

104
00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:24.406
Good morning, sir.

105
00:14:24.657 --> 00:14:26.116
Salute.

106
00:14:28.244 --> 00:14:31.663
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.

107
00:14:31.873 --> 00:14:33.665
-It's my manner.
-Your what?

108
00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:36.752
My manner. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't.

109
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:41.006
I can't make out whether you're
bad-mannered or just half-witted.

110
00:14:41.341 --> 00:14:44.218
-I have the same problem, sir.
-Shut up.

111
00:14:44.511 --> 00:14:47.846
The Arab Bureau thinks you
would be of use to them in Arabia.

112
00:14:48.181 --> 00:14:49.765
Why, I can't imagine.

113
00:14:50.016 --> 00:14:52.434
You can't perform
your present duties properly.

114
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:57.564
"I cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city."

115
00:14:57.774 --> 00:15:00.025
-What?
-Themistocles, sir.

116
00:15:00.235 --> 00:15:03.862
-A Greek philosopher.
-I know you've been well-educated.

117
00:15:04.072 --> 00:15:06.365
It says so in your dossier.

118
00:15:08.701 --> 00:15:11.703
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.

119
00:15:13.915 --> 00:15:16.166
But I suppose I could be wrong.

120
00:15:16.751 --> 00:15:19.545
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.

121
00:15:19.712 --> 00:15:23.215
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!

122
00:15:25.218 --> 00:15:26.552
Yes, what is it?

123
00:15:26.803 --> 00:15:29.555
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

124
00:15:29.764 --> 00:15:31.765
-Is that certain?
-Yes, sir.

125
00:15:32.892 --> 00:15:35.060
There doesn't seem to be
any artillery.

126
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.063
But there must be artillery!

127
00:15:40.817 --> 00:15:44.319
Sir, this is something
of an expedition.

128
00:15:44.571 --> 00:15:48.740
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

129
00:15:48.992 --> 00:15:51.577
He can't do that in six weeks.

130
00:15:52.245 --> 00:15:54.913
-Two months, then.
-Three.

131
00:15:55.415 --> 00:15:59.501
All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

132
00:15:59.752 --> 00:16:01.420
Thank you, sir.

133
00:16:03.923 --> 00:16:07.259
I'd like to say, sir,
that I am grateful for this.

134
00:16:07.468 --> 00:16:09.344
Shut up and get out.

135
00:16:15.435 --> 00:16:16.810
Sir?

136
00:16:22.442 --> 00:16:25.736
How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?

137
00:16:26.738 --> 00:16:30.616
-How did you do it?
-Might better ask why I bothered to.

138
00:16:30.867 --> 00:16:34.369
-Because I'm the man for the job.
-I just wonder about that.

139
00:16:34.621 --> 00:16:37.497
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?

140
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.458
Find Prince Feisal.

141
00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:41.543
Good. And when I've found him?

142
00:16:43.504 --> 00:16:45.797
Find out what kind of a man he is.

143
00:16:46.049 --> 00:16:49.801
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.

144
00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:52.512
That is Colonel Brighton's business,
not yours.

145
00:16:52.805 --> 00:16:57.059
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.

146
00:17:00.313 --> 00:17:01.855
That's new.

147
00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:04.816
Where are they now?

148
00:17:04.984 --> 00:17:07.903
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.

149
00:17:08.154 --> 00:17:09.655
They're Hashemite Bedouins.

150
00:17:09.864 --> 00:17:13.533
They can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day.

151
00:17:13.826 --> 00:17:15.786
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

152
00:17:16.496 --> 00:17:20.207
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert:

153
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.002
Bedouins and gods,
and you're neither. Take it from me.

154
00:17:24.212 --> 00:17:27.506
For ordinary men,
it's a burning fiery furnace.

155
00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:31.510
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

156
00:17:35.306 --> 00:17:38.600
It is recognised that you have
a funny sense of fun.

157
00:18:54.594 --> 00:18:56.386
Here you may drink.

158
00:19:00.099 --> 00:19:01.391
One cup.

159
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.776
You do not drink?

160
00:19:11.402 --> 00:19:12.444
No.

161
00:19:13.905 --> 00:19:15.530
I'll drink when you do.

162
00:19:16.449 --> 00:19:17.532
I am Bedu.

163
00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:22.157
Truly, now, you are a British officer?

164
00:21:22.408 --> 00:21:23.783
Yes.

165
00:21:24.535 --> 00:21:26.077
From Cairo?

166
00:21:26.537 --> 00:21:27.954
Yes.

167
00:21:28.581 --> 00:21:31.750
-You did not ride from Cairo?
-No.

168
00:21:32.043 --> 00:21:35.921
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.

169
00:21:36.422 --> 00:21:37.964
And before?

170
00:21:38.591 --> 00:21:41.092
From Britain?

171
00:21:41.427 --> 00:21:42.761
Yes.

172
00:21:44.096 --> 00:21:45.472
Truly?

173
00:21:45.973 --> 00:21:47.432
From Oxfordshire.

174
00:21:49.435 --> 00:21:50.936
Is that a desert country?

175
00:21:51.938 --> 00:21:56.274
No. A fat country. Fat people.

176
00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.069
You are not fat?

177
00:21:59.779 --> 00:22:00.946
No.

178
00:22:02.448 --> 00:22:04.074
I'm different.

179
00:22:32.103 --> 00:22:33.478
Here...

180
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.730
...take it.

181
00:22:36.607 --> 00:22:40.026
First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.

182
00:22:40.319 --> 00:22:41.820
Take it now.

183
00:23:00.381 --> 00:23:02.007
Bedu food.

184
00:23:17.356 --> 00:23:18.690
Good.

185
00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:20.191
More?

186
00:24:09.075 --> 00:24:11.242
-Bedu.
-Where?

187
00:24:32.223 --> 00:24:34.808
From here to Lord Feisal's camp
is Harith country.

188
00:24:35.101 --> 00:24:36.267
Yes, I know.

189
00:24:36.477 --> 00:24:38.436
-I am not Harith.
-No.

190
00:24:38.646 --> 00:24:41.272
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.

191
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.979
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.

192
00:25:21.188 --> 00:25:22.814
When you are ready to go...

193
00:25:23.023 --> 00:25:26.151
...hit her on the shoulder
and say, "Hut-hut-hut."

194
00:25:43.794 --> 00:25:47.422
Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.

195
00:26:04.523 --> 00:26:08.026
I think we reach Masturah Well
tomorrow. Yes.

196
00:26:08.194 --> 00:26:11.863
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.

197
00:26:12.072 --> 00:26:13.239
Now!

198
00:27:13.259 --> 00:27:14.592
Good?

199
00:27:14.802 --> 00:27:16.636
It's all right.

200
00:27:17.763 --> 00:27:19.973
This is a Harith well.

201
00:27:20.432 --> 00:27:22.934
The Harith are a dirty people.

202
00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:45.892
Turks?

203
00:29:12.378 --> 00:29:13.544
Bedu.

204
00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:01.801
Who is he?

205
00:30:55.481 --> 00:30:57.106
He is dead.

206
00:30:57.483 --> 00:30:58.983
Yes.

207
00:31:00.235 --> 00:31:01.319
Why?

208
00:31:04.198 --> 00:31:05.656
This is my well.

209
00:31:07.242 --> 00:31:08.868
I have drunk from it.

210
00:31:09.828 --> 00:31:11.621
You are welcome.

211
00:31:13.332 --> 00:31:14.665
He was my friend.

212
00:31:14.875 --> 00:31:17.710
-That?
-Yes, that.

213
00:31:27.846 --> 00:31:31.057
-This pistol yours?
-No, his.

214
00:31:47.741 --> 00:31:49.033
His?

215
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.868
Mine.

216
00:31:51.537 --> 00:31:53.371
Then I will use it.

217
00:32:01.255 --> 00:32:03.548
Your friend...

218
00:32:05.551 --> 00:32:07.760
...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.

219
00:32:08.053 --> 00:32:09.428
I know.

220
00:32:16.979 --> 00:32:18.271
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.

221
00:32:20.566 --> 00:32:21.899
I have heard of you.

222
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.278
So...

223
00:32:27.614 --> 00:32:29.490
...what was a Hazimi doing here?

224
00:32:29.741 --> 00:32:33.244
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.

225
00:32:33.745 --> 00:32:37.206
-You've been sent from Cairo.
-Yes.

226
00:32:37.708 --> 00:32:41.127
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.

227
00:32:42.087 --> 00:32:44.463
I can both read and write.

228
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.221
My Lord Feisal already
has an Englishman.

229
00:32:52.639 --> 00:32:54.265
What is your name?

230
00:32:55.225 --> 00:32:57.810
My name is for my friends.

231
00:33:03.275 --> 00:33:05.359
None of my friends is a murderer.

232
00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:09.322
You are angry, English.

233
00:33:18.123 --> 00:33:19.957
He was nothing.

234
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.001
The well is everything.

235
00:33:23.045 --> 00:33:25.963
The Hazimi may not drink
at our wells.

236
00:33:26.256 --> 00:33:27.840
He knew that.

237
00:33:30.177 --> 00:33:31.385
Salaam.

238
00:33:32.971 --> 00:33:34.639
Sherif Ali.

239
00:33:34.973 --> 00:33:38.059
So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...

240
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.811
...so long will they be
a little people...

241
00:33:41.063 --> 00:33:42.480
...a silly people.

242
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:47.151
Greedy, barbarous and cruel,
as you are.

243
00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:02.333
Come.

244
00:34:03.377 --> 00:34:05.002
I will take you to Feisal.

245
00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.296
I do not want your company, sherif.

246
00:34:07.506 --> 00:34:10.841
Wadi Safra is another day from here.

247
00:34:11.176 --> 00:34:14.178
You will not find it,
and you will die.

248
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:18.349
I will find it with this.

249
00:34:26.942 --> 00:34:28.943
Good army compass.

250
00:34:29.528 --> 00:34:31.445
How if I take it?

251
00:34:31.863 --> 00:34:33.197
Then you would be a thief.

252
00:34:34.366 --> 00:34:35.700
Have you no fear, English?

253
00:34:36.618 --> 00:34:39.203
My fear is my concern.

254
00:34:39.705 --> 00:34:41.038
Truly.

255
00:34:45.043 --> 00:34:47.086
God be with you, English.

256
00:36:26.353 --> 00:36:28.145
Hey, you!

257
00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.667
-I've been waiting for you.
-Did you know I was coming?

258
00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.169
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.

259
00:36:52.462 --> 00:36:53.838
How did he know?

260
00:36:54.047 --> 00:36:56.966
Not much happens within 50 miles
of Feisal that he doesn't know.

261
00:36:57.175 --> 00:36:59.218
I'll give him that. No escort?

262
00:36:59.469 --> 00:37:01.971
My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.

263
00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.057
-Turks?
-No, an Arab.

264
00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:07.768
Bloody savages.

265
00:37:09.521 --> 00:37:12.606
-This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?
-Yes, they're over there.

266
00:37:12.858 --> 00:37:15.401
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?

267
00:37:15.694 --> 00:37:19.697
Lawrence. I've been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.

268
00:37:22.367 --> 00:37:24.702
What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?

269
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:29.874
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.

270
00:37:30.584 --> 00:37:34.503
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awful.

271
00:37:34.713 --> 00:37:37.882
Their morale, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...

272
00:37:38.091 --> 00:37:42.094
...the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.

273
00:37:42.387 --> 00:37:44.722
They're fading away by dozens
every night.

274
00:37:45.015 --> 00:37:46.599
What I want to say is this:

275
00:37:46.892 --> 00:37:49.518
Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...

276
00:37:49.728 --> 00:37:51.562
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.

277
00:37:51.771 --> 00:37:55.566
When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.

278
00:37:55.734 --> 00:37:59.737
-Do you understand what I'm saying?
-I understand what you're saying.

279
00:37:59.905 --> 00:38:02.823
You'll make your appreciation
and get back to--

280
00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:07.244
Oh, my God.

281
00:38:07.913 --> 00:38:09.747
Not again.

282
00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:41.779
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.

283
00:38:41.988 --> 00:38:45.157
"Move South," I've said.
"You're still in range."

284
00:38:47.118 --> 00:38:50.621
They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!

285
00:39:17.148 --> 00:39:20.526
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

286
00:39:25.657 --> 00:39:27.116
Fire back at them.

287
00:40:39.105 --> 00:40:42.232
-Who are you?
-Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

288
00:40:42.484 --> 00:40:44.193
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

289
00:40:44.402 --> 00:40:47.696
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.

290
00:40:47.906 --> 00:40:50.282
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

291
00:40:50.575 --> 00:40:53.410
You were right and I was wrong.

292
00:40:53.703 --> 00:40:55.746
We must take some thought
for the wounded.

293
00:40:55.997 --> 00:40:59.249
-We can take care of them at Yenbo.
-If they can get to Yenbo.

294
00:40:59.459 --> 00:41:01.001
They can hardly come with us.

295
00:41:01.252 --> 00:41:05.589
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant...?

296
00:41:06.424 --> 00:41:07.633
Lawrence.

297
00:41:07.926 --> 00:41:10.302
You understand,
Lieutenant Lawrence...

298
00:41:10.512 --> 00:41:15.599
...my people are unused to
explosives and machines.

299
00:41:16.142 --> 00:41:20.104
First the guns, and now this.

300
00:42:14.701 --> 00:42:15.993
Cigarette?

301
00:42:16.202 --> 00:42:17.661
I'm sorry.

302
00:42:28.381 --> 00:42:30.340
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

303
00:42:31.217 --> 00:42:32.551
Umph off.

304
00:42:33.386 --> 00:42:36.221
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?

305
00:42:53.907 --> 00:42:55.073
Hold it, Jenkins!

306
00:42:59.412 --> 00:43:00.871
Jenkins!

307
00:43:10.256 --> 00:43:11.882
Lawrence?

308
00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.636
You have no servant.

309
00:43:15.887 --> 00:43:18.388
-I don't need a servant.
-No?

310
00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:22.392
We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash clothes.

311
00:43:22.602 --> 00:43:24.603
-Yes, everything.
-I don't doubt it.

312
00:43:24.896 --> 00:43:27.940
-It will be very nice for you.
-I can't afford it.

313
00:43:51.089 --> 00:43:55.467
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

314
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.429
God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...

315
00:44:00.306 --> 00:44:05.686
...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

316
00:44:07.021 --> 00:44:11.275
Others do battle in his cause.

317
00:44:11.484 --> 00:44:15.821
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

318
00:44:16.447 --> 00:44:19.283
And observe the prayers.

319
00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:25.914
This will be best and richest
in the recompense.

320
00:44:27.041 --> 00:44:30.961
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

321
00:44:31.713 --> 00:44:36.800
Verily, God is forgiving, merciful--

322
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.468
Greetings, Ali.

323
00:44:38.636 --> 00:44:40.470
-My lord.
-Sherif Ali.

324
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.933
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, l think.

325
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:47.644
Yes, my lord.

326
00:44:50.148 --> 00:44:52.441
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

327
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.985
"By the noonday brightness...

328
00:44:55.194 --> 00:44:57.321
...and by the night
when it darkeneth...

329
00:44:57.572 --> 00:44:59.990
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

330
00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:02.659
...neither hath He been displeased.

331
00:45:02.952 --> 00:45:07.205
And surely the future shall be better
for thee than the past."

332
00:45:07.498 --> 00:45:11.001
"And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee...

333
00:45:11.169 --> 00:45:13.503
...and thou be satisfied."

334
00:45:15.465 --> 00:45:16.840
So?

335
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.010
Yes, colonel.

336
00:45:20.386 --> 00:45:24.097
-I want a decision, sir.
-You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

337
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:27.017
Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.

338
00:45:27.226 --> 00:45:31.188
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

339
00:45:31.397 --> 00:45:33.357
You could supply us through Aqaba!

340
00:45:33.775 --> 00:45:35.359
Aqaba!

341
00:45:36.194 --> 00:45:38.862
If you can get ahold of Aqaba,
we can supply you.

342
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:41.031
-But you can't!
-You could.

343
00:45:41.532 --> 00:45:44.117
You mean, the navy?

344
00:45:45.036 --> 00:45:48.372
The Turks have 1 2-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.

345
00:45:48.581 --> 00:45:50.582
Can you imagine what that means?

346
00:45:50.875 --> 00:45:52.542
Yes, I can imagine.

347
00:45:52.752 --> 00:45:57.005
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.

348
00:45:57.215 --> 00:45:59.716
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

349
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:04.137
The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.

350
00:46:04.389 --> 00:46:06.223
You can see that, sir, surely.

351
00:46:06.391 --> 00:46:09.393
I see that the canal is
an essential British interest.

352
00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.603
It is of little consequence to us.

353
00:46:12.105 --> 00:46:14.147
I must ask you not to speak like that.

354
00:46:14.399 --> 00:46:17.067
British and Arab interests are
one and the same.

355
00:46:18.403 --> 00:46:20.070
Possibly.

356
00:46:21.739 --> 00:46:24.032
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.

357
00:46:24.242 --> 00:46:26.910
Fall back on Yenbo and we will
give you equipment.

358
00:46:27.078 --> 00:46:29.287
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

359
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.416
-Guns?
-A modern rifle for every man.

360
00:46:32.667 --> 00:46:35.585
No. Guns. Artillery.

361
00:46:35.795 --> 00:46:39.089
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.

362
00:46:39.257 --> 00:46:42.342
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

363
00:46:42.593 --> 00:46:46.263
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

364
00:46:46.556 --> 00:46:48.181
English will teach
Bedu to fight?

365
00:46:48.433 --> 00:46:52.561
We will teach them, Sherif Ali,
to fight a modern mechanised army.

366
00:46:54.188 --> 00:46:58.316
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?

367
00:47:02.155 --> 00:47:04.990
I think it is far from Damascus.

368
00:47:05.283 --> 00:47:08.618
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.

369
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:11.830
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?

370
00:47:12.457 --> 00:47:13.832
Yes, my lord.

371
00:47:14.876 --> 00:47:16.501
It is beautiful, is it not?

372
00:47:16.794 --> 00:47:18.462
-Very .
-That will do, Lawrence.

373
00:47:18.713 --> 00:47:22.799
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
but discipline will.

374
00:47:23.092 --> 00:47:28.138
Look, Great Britain is a small
country, much smaller than yours.

375
00:47:28.347 --> 00:47:30.640
Small population compared with some.

376
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:34.019
It's small, but it's great. And why?

377
00:47:34.312 --> 00:47:37.147
-Because it has guns.
-Because it has discipline.

378
00:47:37.356 --> 00:47:39.649
Because it has a navy,
because of this...

379
00:47:39.817 --> 00:47:41.526
...the English go
where they please...

380
00:47:41.819 --> 00:47:44.362
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.

381
00:47:44.655 --> 00:47:46.740
-Right.
-Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

382
00:47:46.991 --> 00:47:49.242
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

383
00:47:49.494 --> 00:47:51.620
But I would like to hear his opinion.

384
00:47:52.038 --> 00:47:54.247
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?

385
00:47:54.499 --> 00:47:57.918
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

386
00:47:58.169 --> 00:48:03.423
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.

387
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:08.220
My lord, I think....

388
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.348
I think your book is right.

389
00:48:11.682 --> 00:48:16.061
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.

390
00:48:16.354 --> 00:48:18.355
On this ocean, the Bedu go
where they please...

391
00:48:18.523 --> 00:48:20.023
...and strike where they please.

392
00:48:20.274 --> 00:48:22.526
This is the way the Bedu has
always fought.

393
00:48:22.777 --> 00:48:25.695
You're famed through the world
for fighting this way.

394
00:48:25.947 --> 00:48:28.073
And this is the way you should
fight now.

395
00:48:28.366 --> 00:48:29.908
I don't know.

396
00:48:30.201 --> 00:48:32.410
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

397
00:48:33.037 --> 00:48:37.374
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.

398
00:48:37.583 --> 00:48:39.751
-What is this to you?
-You're a traitor.

399
00:48:40.044 --> 00:48:42.045
No, colonel.

400
00:48:42.296 --> 00:48:45.549
He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.

401
00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.885
They must say their say.

402
00:48:50.054 --> 00:48:55.058
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.

403
00:48:55.226 --> 00:48:57.769
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.

404
00:48:58.062 --> 00:49:00.564
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

405
00:49:02.608 --> 00:49:04.568
You tread heavily...

406
00:49:05.611 --> 00:49:08.280
...but you speak the truth.

407
00:49:09.907 --> 00:49:13.410
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

408
00:49:13.786 --> 00:49:15.579
...it is late.

409
00:49:31.304 --> 00:49:33.805
Colonel Brighton means
to put my men...

410
00:49:33.973 --> 00:49:36.850
...under European officers,
does he not?

411
00:49:37.101 --> 00:49:38.977
In effect, my lord, yes.

412
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:41.271
And l must do it...

413
00:49:41.856 --> 00:49:45.609
...because the Turks have
European guns.

414
00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.528
But I fear to do it...

415
00:49:49.447 --> 00:49:51.656
...upon my soul I do.

416
00:49:53.618 --> 00:49:57.787
The English have a great hunger for
desolate places.

417
00:49:57.997 --> 00:50:01.166
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

418
00:50:01.459 --> 00:50:03.335
Then you must deny it to them.

419
00:50:03.628 --> 00:50:07.172
You are an Englishman.
Are you not loyal to England?

420
00:50:07.798 --> 00:50:10.759
To England and to other things.

421
00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:13.637
To England and Arabia both?

422
00:50:13.846 --> 00:50:15.639
And is that possible?

423
00:50:22.396 --> 00:50:26.650
I think you are another of these
desert-loving English.

424
00:50:26.859 --> 00:50:28.985
Doughty, Stanhope...

425
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:31.905
...Gordon of Khartoum.

426
00:50:32.156 --> 00:50:34.407
No Arab loves the desert.

427
00:50:34.659 --> 00:50:39.663
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

428
00:50:40.706 --> 00:50:43.166
And no man needs nothing.

429
00:50:46.295 --> 00:50:49.881
Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with...

430
00:50:50.174 --> 00:50:53.718
...because we are a little people,
a silly people...

431
00:50:54.011 --> 00:50:58.181
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?

432
00:50:58.516 --> 00:51:01.810
Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...

433
00:51:02.019 --> 00:51:04.521
...were two miles of lighting
in the streets...

434
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:06.439
...when London was a village.

435
00:51:06.691 --> 00:51:09.526
Yes, you were great.

436
00:51:09.735 --> 00:51:11.861
Nine centuries ago.

437
00:51:12.113 --> 00:51:14.322
Time to be great again, my lord.

438
00:51:14.532 --> 00:51:17.826
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.

439
00:51:18.035 --> 00:51:21.830
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the English.

440
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.333
But my father is old...

441
00:51:26.335 --> 00:51:28.044
...and I...

442
00:51:29.714 --> 00:51:33.425
...I long for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.

443
00:51:35.261 --> 00:51:38.221
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

444
00:51:39.557 --> 00:51:43.435
To be great again, it seems that we
need the English...

445
00:51:43.728 --> 00:51:44.728
...or....

446
00:51:44.979 --> 00:51:46.396
Or?

447
00:51:46.897 --> 00:51:50.567
What no man can provide,
Mr. Lawrence.

448
00:51:50.776 --> 00:51:53.236
We need a miracle.

449
00:54:58.547 --> 00:55:00.147
Aqaba.

450
00:55:05.304 --> 00:55:06.930
From the land.

451
00:55:07.932 --> 00:55:09.682
You are mad.

452
00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:14.479
To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nefud Desert.

453
00:55:14.688 --> 00:55:15.939
That's right.

454
00:55:16.273 --> 00:55:18.441
The Nefud cannot be crossed.

455
00:55:18.651 --> 00:55:20.568
I'll cross it if you will.

456
00:55:20.778 --> 00:55:24.948
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.

457
00:55:25.157 --> 00:55:27.951
The Nefud is the worst place
God created.

458
00:55:28.202 --> 00:55:32.205
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.

459
00:55:32.623 --> 00:55:34.123
Fifty men?

460
00:55:34.375 --> 00:55:36.960
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

461
00:55:37.169 --> 00:55:39.587
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...

462
00:55:39.797 --> 00:55:42.840
...they would be 50 men
other men might join.

463
00:55:43.634 --> 00:55:45.969
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

464
00:55:46.303 --> 00:55:49.305
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.

465
00:55:49.598 --> 00:55:51.808
-Good fighters, though.
-Good--

466
00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:56.187
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

467
00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:00.608
They face the sea, Sherif Ali,
and cannot be turned around.

468
00:56:00.818 --> 00:56:04.529
From the landward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.

469
00:56:04.822 --> 00:56:09.826
With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.

470
00:56:10.035 --> 00:56:12.662
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.

471
00:56:16.125 --> 00:56:18.126
Aqaba's over there.

472
00:56:20.671 --> 00:56:22.880
It's only a matter of going.

473
00:56:24.008 --> 00:56:26.342
You are mad.

474
00:56:33.517 --> 00:56:36.019
And where are you going, lieutenant?

475
00:56:37.354 --> 00:56:39.397
With 50 of my men.

476
00:56:41.025 --> 00:56:42.233
To work your miracle.

477
00:56:42.568 --> 00:56:46.863
Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.

478
00:56:47.573 --> 00:56:50.199
-Who told you?
-Ali did.

479
00:56:50.367 --> 00:56:52.076
Why not you?

480
00:56:53.704 --> 00:56:56.706
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?

481
00:56:56.957 --> 00:56:59.208
Yes, I must.

482
00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.545
But I will spare these to you.

483
00:57:04.423 --> 00:57:07.550
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

484
00:57:08.177 --> 00:57:12.096
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance,
my lord.

485
00:57:13.057 --> 00:57:15.558
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.

486
00:57:15.768 --> 00:57:16.809
No.

487
00:57:28.697 --> 00:57:30.698
Since you do know...

488
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.744
...we can claim to arrive
in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

489
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:38.414
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.

490
00:57:39.249 --> 00:57:42.335
But in whose name do you ride?

491
01:00:10.901 --> 01:00:13.569
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

492
01:00:13.862 --> 01:00:16.072
They were here. I caught them.

493
01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.158
Why are you here? Boy!

494
01:00:19.409 --> 01:00:21.285
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

495
01:00:21.578 --> 01:00:24.163
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.

496
01:00:24.414 --> 01:00:26.249
You have been tracking us.

497
01:00:26.917 --> 01:00:29.168
-You were told to stay.
-No, sherif.

498
01:00:29.419 --> 01:00:31.462
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

499
01:00:31.755 --> 01:00:34.632
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.

500
01:00:34.925 --> 01:00:37.510
-It is the will of Allah.
-Blasphemy.

501
01:00:37.761 --> 01:00:39.011
Don't do that.

502
01:00:39.471 --> 01:00:44.183
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.

503
01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:47.520
Be warned. They are not suitable.

504
01:00:47.771 --> 01:00:51.524
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.

505
01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:56.612
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

506
01:01:00.617 --> 01:01:03.452
One shilling, every week?

507
01:01:03.662 --> 01:01:05.288
That is fair.

508
01:01:05.956 --> 01:01:07.290
-Each?
-No.

509
01:01:07.499 --> 01:01:09.125
-That is too much.
-All right.

510
01:01:17.718 --> 01:01:21.929
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.

511
01:01:35.819 --> 01:01:37.570
There is the railway.

512
01:01:38.447 --> 01:01:41.365
And that is the desert.

513
01:01:42.826 --> 01:01:46.537
From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.

514
01:01:46.747 --> 01:01:50.041
For the camels, no water at all.

515
01:01:50.667 --> 01:01:52.835
If the camels die...

516
01:01:54.171 --> 01:01:55.504
...we die.

517
01:01:56.465 --> 01:01:59.258
And in 20 days they will start to die.

518
01:02:04.765 --> 01:02:08.017
There's no time to waste, then,
is there?

519
01:04:40.128 --> 01:04:41.837
I was thinking.

520
01:04:42.047 --> 01:04:43.756
You were drifting.

521
01:04:45.717 --> 01:04:49.386
Yes. It will not happen again.

522
01:04:49.679 --> 01:04:53.349
Be warned, you were drifting.

523
01:04:54.017 --> 01:04:56.060
It will not happen again.

524
01:05:58.206 --> 01:06:00.082
That water is wasted.

525
01:06:05.505 --> 01:06:07.798
From now on,
we must travel by night...

526
01:06:08.091 --> 01:06:10.968
...and rest while it is
too hot to travel.

527
01:06:11.261 --> 01:06:13.637
A few hours each day.

528
01:06:15.473 --> 01:06:17.433
Why don't we start now?

529
01:06:17.601 --> 01:06:20.311
No. We will rest now.

530
01:06:22.147 --> 01:06:23.272
Three hours.

531
01:06:23.523 --> 01:06:24.940
Fine.

532
01:06:25.525 --> 01:06:26.984
I'll wake you.

533
01:08:45.498 --> 01:08:47.082
Do we rest here?

534
01:08:47.292 --> 01:08:50.461
There is no rest now short of water.

535
01:08:50.754 --> 01:08:52.755
The other side of that.

536
01:08:53.923 --> 01:08:56.091
And how much of that is there?

537
01:08:56.426 --> 01:08:57.968
I'm not sure.

538
01:08:59.095 --> 01:09:03.432
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.

539
01:09:04.517 --> 01:09:06.769
This is the sun's anvil.

540
01:10:39.362 --> 01:10:40.612
Have we done it?

541
01:10:40.864 --> 01:10:43.991
No, but we're off the anvil.

542
01:10:44.868 --> 01:10:46.410
Thank God for that anyway.

543
01:10:46.619 --> 01:10:48.537
Yes, thank him.

544
01:10:48.788 --> 01:10:52.374
Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted him.

545
01:10:52.625 --> 01:10:53.917
I know.

546
01:10:57.255 --> 01:10:58.755
We've done it.

547
01:10:59.048 --> 01:11:00.591
God willing.

548
01:11:02.719 --> 01:11:04.761
When do we reach the wells?

549
01:11:05.138 --> 01:11:08.307
God willing, midday.

550
01:11:08.808 --> 01:11:12.227
-Then we've done it.
-Thank him, Lawrence. Thank him.

551
01:11:15.899 --> 01:11:17.524
Gasim's.

552
01:11:21.404 --> 01:11:23.113
What's happened to him?

553
01:11:23.907 --> 01:11:25.407
God knows.

554
01:11:27.076 --> 01:11:28.952
Why don't you stop?

555
01:11:29.412 --> 01:11:32.915
For what? He will be dead by midday.

556
01:11:38.254 --> 01:11:40.047
We must go back.

557
01:11:40.256 --> 01:11:43.133
What for, to die with Gasim?

558
01:11:44.427 --> 01:11:46.678
In one hour comes the sun.

559
01:11:48.181 --> 01:11:52.851
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

560
01:11:53.102 --> 01:11:54.436
I can.

561
01:11:55.271 --> 01:11:56.939
Take the boys.

562
01:12:02.779 --> 01:12:05.280
If you go back, you kill yourself,
is all.

563
01:12:05.448 --> 01:12:07.783
Gasim you have killed already.

564
01:12:08.284 --> 01:12:09.618
Get out of my way.

565
01:12:09.953 --> 01:12:13.789
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.

566
01:12:13.998 --> 01:12:15.332
Nothing is written!

567
01:12:18.461 --> 01:12:19.878
Go back, then!

568
01:12:20.296 --> 01:12:23.632
What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?

569
01:12:24.634 --> 01:12:26.510
English blasphemer!

570
01:12:27.637 --> 01:12:29.221
Aqaba?

571
01:12:29.722 --> 01:12:31.515
Was it Aqaba?

572
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:35.102
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

573
01:12:37.146 --> 01:12:38.730
Go back, blasphemer...

574
01:12:39.315 --> 01:12:41.316
...but you will not be at Aqaba.

575
01:12:41.693 --> 01:12:43.402
I shall be at Aqaba.

576
01:12:43.653 --> 01:12:45.696
That is written.

577
01:12:46.322 --> 01:12:47.614
In here.

578
01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:01.169
English!

579
01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:37.148
Lawrence! Daud!

580
01:21:45.569 --> 01:21:47.695
Nothing is written.

581
01:22:19.895 --> 01:22:21.479
Al Lawrence.

582
01:22:25.901 --> 01:22:27.318
Farraj.

583
01:22:28.445 --> 01:22:29.612
Wash.

584
01:23:06.817 --> 01:23:08.526
Al Lawrence.

585
01:23:08.986 --> 01:23:13.615
Truly, for some men nothing is written
unless they write it.

586
01:23:18.287 --> 01:23:21.289
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

587
01:23:21.498 --> 01:23:24.250
-Al Lawrence is better.
-True.

588
01:23:26.253 --> 01:23:28.838
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

589
01:23:35.179 --> 01:23:37.972
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

590
01:23:38.182 --> 01:23:40.975
-Is that a lord?
-A kind of lord.

591
01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:44.062
Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.

592
01:23:44.313 --> 01:23:45.521
No.

593
01:23:47.691 --> 01:23:49.484
You have an elder brother.

594
01:23:49.652 --> 01:23:50.860
No.

595
01:23:51.028 --> 01:23:56.157
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.

596
01:23:57.701 --> 01:23:59.661
He didn't marry my mother.

597
01:24:01.163 --> 01:24:02.830
I see.

598
01:24:03.332 --> 01:24:04.707
I'm sorry.

599
01:24:06.669 --> 01:24:10.588
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

600
01:24:13.175 --> 01:24:15.677
Yes, I suppose I am.

601
01:24:17.012 --> 01:24:18.721
Al Lawrence is best.

602
01:24:21.684 --> 01:24:25.812
All right, l'll settle for
Al Lawrence.

603
01:24:55.467 --> 01:24:58.553
They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.

604
01:25:11.233 --> 01:25:12.900
Very fine.

605
01:25:14.903 --> 01:25:18.990
-Great honour.
-The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

606
01:25:19.241 --> 01:25:21.659
-Is it permitted?
-Surely.

607
01:25:26.874 --> 01:25:31.919
He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan.

608
01:25:39.928 --> 01:25:43.181
They are good for riding. Try.

609
01:27:35.294 --> 01:27:37.003
What are you doing, Englishman?

610
01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:39.922
As you see.

611
01:27:41.216 --> 01:27:42.258
Are you alone?

612
01:27:42.718 --> 01:27:44.302
Almost.

613
01:27:52.936 --> 01:27:55.396
Are you with those dogs
drinking at my well?

614
01:27:55.647 --> 01:27:57.064
Yours?

615
01:28:00.652 --> 01:28:02.445
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

616
01:28:04.239 --> 01:28:07.074
I've heard of another man
of that name.

617
01:28:07.951 --> 01:28:09.660
Other? What other?

618
01:28:10.037 --> 01:28:14.248
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.

619
01:28:17.753 --> 01:28:19.921
He must be a great hero.

620
01:28:20.130 --> 01:28:21.839
He is.

621
01:28:22.090 --> 01:28:25.259
He wouldn't refuse water to men
coming out of Nefud Desert.

622
01:28:25.594 --> 01:28:27.678
Now, would he not?

623
01:28:30.265 --> 01:28:33.100
No, that must be some other man.

624
01:28:35.604 --> 01:28:37.480
Here is my help.

625
01:29:03.173 --> 01:29:05.841
Son, what fashion is this?

626
01:29:07.177 --> 01:29:10.846
-Harith, Father.
-What manner of Harith?

627
01:29:11.473 --> 01:29:12.807
A Beni Wejh sherif.

628
01:29:13.809 --> 01:29:15.309
And is he Harith?

629
01:29:15.519 --> 01:29:17.728
No, Father, English.

630
01:29:20.983 --> 01:29:22.316
Son...

631
01:29:23.151 --> 01:29:25.236
...they are stealing our water.

632
01:29:26.154 --> 01:29:27.989
Tell them we are coming.

633
01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:29.824
Tell them.

634
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:41.437
-Empty that!
-Do not!

635
01:30:43.732 --> 01:30:45.900
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

636
01:30:46.693 --> 01:30:48.736
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.

637
01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.212
Harith.

638
01:31:07.089 --> 01:31:08.255
Ali.

639
01:31:08.965 --> 01:31:11.217
Does your father still steal?

640
01:31:13.303 --> 01:31:14.512
No.

641
01:31:16.139 --> 01:31:19.100
Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?

642
01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:23.479
No. There is no resemblance.

643
01:31:24.356 --> 01:31:26.774
Alas, you resemble your father.

644
01:31:27.234 --> 01:31:30.111
-Auda flatters me.
-You are easily flattered.

645
01:31:30.654 --> 01:31:33.114
I knew your father well.

646
01:31:33.532 --> 01:31:35.366
Did you know your own?

647
01:31:38.745 --> 01:31:43.457
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?

648
01:31:43.959 --> 01:31:47.044
Why, then you have a blood feud
with the Howeitat.

649
01:31:48.338 --> 01:31:51.382
-Do you desire it?
-Not the generals in Cairo...

650
01:31:51.883 --> 01:31:54.969
...nor the sultan himself desire that.

651
01:31:58.140 --> 01:31:59.306
Call off your men.

652
01:32:04.855 --> 01:32:07.481
This honours the unworthy.

653
01:32:07.816 --> 01:32:09.900
I've only just begun to teach him.

654
01:32:10.152 --> 01:32:14.405
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?

655
01:32:14.656 --> 01:32:16.657
Be not clever with me, English.

656
01:32:18.368 --> 01:32:21.662
-Who is he?
-A friend of Prince Feisal's.

657
01:32:31.173 --> 01:32:34.341
-So you desire my hospitality?
-Yes.

658
01:32:34.551 --> 01:32:36.051
Is he your tongue?

659
01:32:36.803 --> 01:32:38.554
We do desire it.

660
01:32:41.725 --> 01:32:44.852
Then it is given, if you will take it.

661
01:32:46.354 --> 01:32:48.189
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

662
01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:53.194
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.

663
01:32:53.945 --> 01:32:58.365
Tomorrow, maybe l will allow the
Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.

664
01:32:59.618 --> 01:33:00.868
But...

665
01:33:01.369 --> 01:33:02.703
...dine with me.

666
01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.539
Dine with Auda, English.

667
01:33:06.374 --> 01:33:08.876
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

668
01:33:09.628 --> 01:33:14.381
It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

669
01:35:54.042 --> 01:35:57.711
This thing you work against Aqaba...

670
01:35:58.088 --> 01:36:00.506
...what profit do you hope from it?

671
01:36:00.715 --> 01:36:03.300
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

672
01:36:03.551 --> 01:36:05.636
The Harith do not work for profit.

673
01:36:06.805 --> 01:36:10.557
Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali...

674
01:36:11.059 --> 01:36:13.560
...he could find worse masters
than Feisal.

675
01:36:13.895 --> 01:36:16.730
But I....
I cannot serve.

676
01:36:17.607 --> 01:36:20.651
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

677
01:36:20.902 --> 01:36:22.903
Yes, it is my pleasure.

678
01:36:27.909 --> 01:36:31.412
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

679
01:36:31.913 --> 01:36:32.913
No?

680
01:36:33.957 --> 01:36:36.625
-For the English, then?
-For the Arabs.

681
01:36:37.252 --> 01:36:38.669
The Arabs?

682
01:36:39.462 --> 01:36:43.757
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

683
01:36:43.967 --> 01:36:45.968
I have even heard of the Harith.

684
01:36:46.636 --> 01:36:48.137
But the Arabs?

685
01:36:48.596 --> 01:36:50.764
What tribe is that?

686
01:36:52.434 --> 01:36:56.603
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.

687
01:36:56.813 --> 01:36:58.856
Well, they are nothing to me.

688
01:36:59.107 --> 01:37:00.983
My tribe is the Howeitat.

689
01:37:01.192 --> 01:37:03.569
Who work only for profit.

690
01:37:03.778 --> 01:37:05.446
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

691
01:37:05.613 --> 01:37:08.282
And Auda's pleasure is
to serve the Turks.

692
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:09.616
Serve?

693
01:37:10.076 --> 01:37:11.118
I serve?

694
01:37:11.327 --> 01:37:13.996
It is the servant who takes money.

695
01:37:19.294 --> 01:37:21.003
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

696
01:37:21.296 --> 01:37:23.130
-Does Auda serve?
-No!

697
01:37:23.298 --> 01:37:26.467
-Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
-No!

698
01:37:31.139 --> 01:37:35.225
I carry 23 great wounds,
all got in battle.

699
01:37:35.685 --> 01:37:39.188
75 men have I killed with
my own hands, in battle.

700
01:37:39.397 --> 01:37:43.609
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.

701
01:37:43.818 --> 01:37:47.905
The Turks pay me a golden treasure,
yet I am poor!

702
01:37:48.156 --> 01:37:52.326
Because I am a river to my people.

703
01:38:01.002 --> 01:38:02.169
Is that service?

704
01:38:02.712 --> 01:38:04.004
No.

705
01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.223
And yet now it seems Auda
has grown old.

706
01:38:14.432 --> 01:38:17.184
And lost his taste for fighting.

707
01:38:17.352 --> 01:38:21.522
It is well you say it in my tent,
thou old tulip.

708
01:38:21.731 --> 01:38:25.526
Yet this is a tulip
that the Turks could not buy.

709
01:38:25.693 --> 01:38:27.528
Why should they wish to?

710
01:38:29.697 --> 01:38:30.739
Now....

711
01:38:31.366 --> 01:38:35.536
I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is...

712
01:38:35.745 --> 01:38:38.038
...a servant's wages.

713
01:38:38.206 --> 01:38:42.209
They pay me, month by month...

714
01:38:42.418 --> 01:38:46.547
...1 00 golden guineas.

715
01:38:47.715 --> 01:38:50.884
1 50, Auda.

716
01:38:51.094 --> 01:38:54.054
-Who told you that?
-I have long ears.

717
01:38:54.222 --> 01:38:56.557
And a long tongue between them.

718
01:38:56.724 --> 01:39:00.102
1 00, 1 50, what matters?
It's a trifle.

719
01:39:00.311 --> 01:39:04.106
A trifle which they take
from a great box they have.

720
01:39:04.315 --> 01:39:06.316
In Aqaba.

721
01:39:07.569 --> 01:39:10.279
-In Aqaba?
-Where else?

722
01:39:11.197 --> 01:39:14.074
You trouble me like women.

723
01:39:14.409 --> 01:39:17.578
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda will not come to Aqaba.

724
01:39:18.246 --> 01:39:19.413
-For money?
-No.

725
01:39:19.747 --> 01:39:20.914
-For Feisal?
-No!

726
01:39:21.124 --> 01:39:24.209
Nor to drive away the Turks.

727
01:39:24.961 --> 01:39:26.837
He will come...

728
01:39:27.755 --> 01:39:30.090
...because it is his pleasure.

729
01:39:32.093 --> 01:39:35.762
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

730
01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:40.601
Make God your agent!

731
01:39:41.936 --> 01:39:45.981
Aqaba!

732
01:40:01.664 --> 01:40:04.264
God be with you.

733
01:43:22.365 --> 01:43:23.824
Yes.

734
01:43:24.158 --> 01:43:25.200
Aqaba.

735
01:43:26.828 --> 01:43:29.496
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

736
01:43:30.706 --> 01:43:33.667
-Do you think we shall?
-Yes.

737
01:43:33.835 --> 01:43:36.586
If you are right about the guns.

738
01:44:04.532 --> 01:44:07.242
He killed. He dies.

739
01:44:07.994 --> 01:44:10.203
This is the end of Aqaba.

740
01:44:12.874 --> 01:44:14.708
One of our men
murdered Auda's man.

741
01:44:14.876 --> 01:44:15.876
Why?

742
01:44:16.085 --> 01:44:19.129
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.

743
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:20.797
Ali!

744
01:44:21.215 --> 01:44:23.049
It is an ancient wound.

745
01:44:23.259 --> 01:44:26.219
I didn't come here to watch
a tribal bloodbath.

746
01:44:30.725 --> 01:44:32.893
It is the law, Lawrence.

747
01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:35.395
The law says the man must die.

748
01:44:36.314 --> 01:44:39.399
If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?

749
01:44:40.401 --> 01:44:41.651
Yes.

750
01:44:45.114 --> 01:44:46.740
Sherif Ali!

751
01:44:46.908 --> 01:44:49.910
If none of Lord Auda's men harms
any of yours...

752
01:44:50.286 --> 01:44:53.538
-...will that content the Harith?
-Yes.

753
01:44:59.670 --> 01:45:02.297
Then I will execute the law.

754
01:45:03.299 --> 01:45:05.425
I have no tribe.

755
01:45:06.677 --> 01:45:08.970
And no one is offended.

756
01:45:21.442 --> 01:45:22.442
Gasim.

757
01:45:26.948 --> 01:45:28.365
Did you do it?

758
01:45:55.309 --> 01:45:56.977
Well, Lawrence....

759
01:46:04.485 --> 01:46:05.860
What ails the Englishman?

760
01:46:06.112 --> 01:46:09.531
That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nefud.

761
01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:11.741
It was written, then.

762
01:46:12.618 --> 01:46:14.619
Better to have left him.

763
01:46:18.249 --> 01:46:21.543
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.

764
01:46:22.003 --> 01:46:24.254
Besides, it was necessary.

765
01:46:25.339 --> 01:46:27.549
You gave life and you took it.

766
01:46:28.134 --> 01:46:29.676
The writing is still yours.

767
01:47:06.881 --> 01:47:08.965
Auda Abu Tayi!

768
01:50:24.995 --> 01:50:27.247
The miracle is accomplished.

769
01:50:28.249 --> 01:50:29.874
Garlands for the conqueror.

770
01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:54.148
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.

771
01:50:54.942 --> 01:50:56.651
I'm none of those things, Ali.

772
01:50:56.902 --> 01:50:59.529
-What, then?
-Don't know.

773
01:51:00.614 --> 01:51:01.906
Thanks.

774
01:51:03.450 --> 01:51:05.618
My God, I love this country.

775
01:51:07.288 --> 01:51:08.288
What!

776
01:51:09.331 --> 01:51:11.207
No gold in Aqaba!

777
01:51:12.543 --> 01:51:14.961
Auda, I found it!

778
01:51:24.179 --> 01:51:25.805
That's a pity.

779
01:51:29.351 --> 01:51:31.936
Ali, get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.

780
01:51:32.146 --> 01:51:34.647
Tell Feisal to find boats,
any boats...

781
01:51:34.815 --> 01:51:37.984
...and bring the Arab army here
to Aqaba, quickly.

782
01:51:38.193 --> 01:51:39.360
And you?

783
01:51:40.154 --> 01:51:42.697
I'm going to tell the generals...

784
01:51:43.157 --> 01:51:44.991
...in Cairo.

785
01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:47.535
Yes, cross Sinai.

786
01:51:47.828 --> 01:51:48.828
Come on!

787
01:51:49.163 --> 01:51:50.496
Sinai?

788
01:51:50.998 --> 01:51:52.332
Yes.

789
01:51:52.833 --> 01:51:56.502
-With these?
-They'll be all right with me.

790
01:52:01.759 --> 01:52:05.887
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:

791
01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:09.015
"We've taken Aqaba,"
the generals would laugh.

792
01:52:09.767 --> 01:52:11.059
I see.

793
01:52:11.685 --> 01:52:14.854
In Cairo you will put off
these funny clothes.

794
01:52:15.022 --> 01:52:19.233
You'll wear trousers and tell stories
of our quaintness and barbarity...

795
01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:22.111
...and then they will believe you.

796
01:52:22.696 --> 01:52:24.864
You're an ignorant man.

797
01:52:44.885 --> 01:52:46.302
Paper.

798
01:52:47.221 --> 01:52:49.055
Paper!

799
01:52:51.767 --> 01:52:54.435
There is no gold in Aqaba.

800
01:52:55.562 --> 01:52:57.397
No gold.

801
01:52:58.774 --> 01:53:00.733
No great box!

802
01:53:04.905 --> 01:53:07.240
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?

803
01:53:07.783 --> 01:53:10.076
For my pleasure, as you said.

804
01:53:11.328 --> 01:53:13.830
But gold is honourable...

805
01:53:14.915 --> 01:53:17.583
...and Lawrence promised gold.

806
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:19.836
Lawrence lied.

807
01:53:21.797 --> 01:53:23.256
See, Auda.

808
01:53:25.926 --> 01:53:28.052
"The Crown of England...

809
01:53:29.138 --> 01:53:31.597
...promises to pay...

810
01:53:32.599 --> 01:53:36.978
...5000 golden guineas...

811
01:53:37.479 --> 01:53:42.191
...to Auda Abu Tayi."

812
01:53:43.318 --> 01:53:47.613
Signed in His Majesty's absence...

813
01:53:47.865 --> 01:53:49.282
...by...

814
01:53:50.993 --> 01:53:52.201
...me.

815
01:53:53.287 --> 01:53:55.455
In 1 0 days...

816
01:53:56.165 --> 01:53:58.291
...I'll be back with the gold.

817
01:53:59.376 --> 01:54:04.130
With gold, with guns, with everything.

818
01:54:05.215 --> 01:54:06.799
Ten days.

819
01:54:08.093 --> 01:54:09.719
You'll cross Sinai?

820
01:54:10.012 --> 01:54:11.387
Why not?

821
01:54:12.139 --> 01:54:13.848
Moses did.

822
01:54:16.477 --> 01:54:18.686
And you will take the children?

823
01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:21.355
Moses did.

824
01:54:21.607 --> 01:54:23.316
Moses was a prophet...

825
01:54:23.817 --> 01:54:26.402
...and beloved of God.

826
01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:35.828
He said there was gold here.
He lied.

827
01:54:37.122 --> 01:54:39.999
He is not perfect.

828
01:54:50.052 --> 01:54:52.512
Lord, can we not rest?

829
01:54:52.679 --> 01:54:55.848
I told you, no rest till
they know that I have Aqaba.

830
01:54:58.060 --> 01:54:59.769
Have you two slept in beds?

831
01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:01.229
Farraj?

832
01:55:01.855 --> 01:55:03.147
Daud?

833
01:55:04.358 --> 01:55:06.025
With sheets?

834
01:55:07.945 --> 01:55:11.405
Tomorrow the finest sheets
in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.

835
01:55:11.657 --> 01:55:12.949
I promise.

836
01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:15.868
Then it shall be so, lord.

837
01:55:37.224 --> 01:55:38.558
Look!

838
01:55:45.315 --> 01:55:46.899
Pillar of fire.

839
01:55:50.112 --> 01:55:52.113
No, lord. Dust.

840
01:56:41.747 --> 01:56:43.247
My compass.

841
01:56:45.042 --> 01:56:46.334
No matter.

842
01:56:46.793 --> 01:56:50.504
If we ride west,
we must strike the canal.

843
01:56:51.632 --> 01:56:53.007
Due west.

844
01:57:13.654 --> 01:57:15.154
Come on!

845
01:57:48.563 --> 01:57:51.190
Lawrence!

846
01:58:03.912 --> 01:58:05.204
Farraj!

847
01:58:15.465 --> 01:58:18.384
Farraj, don't! Don't!

848
01:58:19.428 --> 01:58:20.845
Don't!

849
01:59:56.316 --> 01:59:57.483
Why do you walk?

850
02:00:00.237 --> 02:00:02.237
But why, lord?

851
02:00:15.001 --> 02:00:18.462
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.

852
02:00:44.197 --> 02:00:46.699
Lawrence, look!

853
02:01:55.602 --> 02:01:57.645
It's all right, Farraj.

854
02:01:57.854 --> 02:01:59.438
It's all right.

855
02:03:11.344 --> 02:03:13.344
Who are you?

856
02:03:53.428 --> 02:03:56.055
-Daud!
-We're here, sir.

857
02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:15.783
You taking him in there?

858
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:18.285
Yes.

859
02:04:38.807 --> 02:04:40.224
Here!

860
02:04:42.143 --> 02:04:44.478
Here. You!

861
02:04:46.022 --> 02:04:49.525
And where the hell do you think
you're going to, Mustapha?

862
02:04:50.276 --> 02:04:51.777
We are thirsty.

863
02:04:53.613 --> 02:04:56.031
-Mr. Lawrence, is it?
-Yes.

864
02:04:56.491 --> 02:04:59.618
-Are you going to the officers' bar?
-Yes.

865
02:05:00.829 --> 02:05:03.122
You can't take him in there, sir.

866
02:05:06.793 --> 02:05:09.336
What do you think you look like?

867
02:05:28.022 --> 02:05:29.648
No, no. You must go.

868
02:05:29.858 --> 02:05:31.483
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

869
02:05:33.319 --> 02:05:36.071
Get out! You must get out! Get out!

870
02:05:37.699 --> 02:05:41.994
We want two large glasses
of lemonade.

871
02:05:42.203 --> 02:05:46.039
-This is a bar for British officers.
-We are not particular.

872
02:05:51.379 --> 02:05:55.299
-Are you off your head?
-No. Oddly enough I'm not.

873
02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:59.178
-Just clear out of here, will you?
-Get that boy out of here.

874
02:05:59.512 --> 02:06:02.181
Corporal, we'll have
this one out anyway.

875
02:06:02.849 --> 02:06:05.392
-Get that wog out of here.
-Clear off.

876
02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:09.229
What's going on?

877
02:06:12.192 --> 02:06:16.111
-It's Lawrence, sir.
-Lemonade with ice.

878
02:06:17.447 --> 02:06:19.031
Explain yourself.

879
02:06:19.741 --> 02:06:21.533
We've taken Aqaba.

880
02:06:22.035 --> 02:06:24.703
-Taken Aqaba? Who has?
-We have.

881
02:06:24.954 --> 02:06:29.458
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.

882
02:06:30.210 --> 02:06:31.543
We have.

883
02:06:33.338 --> 02:06:35.214
He likes your lemonade.

884
02:06:35.548 --> 02:06:37.466
You mean the Turks have gone?

885
02:06:37.759 --> 02:06:40.719
No, they're still there
but they've no boots.

886
02:06:41.221 --> 02:06:45.349
Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners. The entire garrison.

887
02:06:45.850 --> 02:06:48.060
That's not true. We killed some.

888
02:06:48.269 --> 02:06:52.231
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.

889
02:06:53.566 --> 02:06:56.443
There's been a lot of killing
one way or another.

890
02:06:58.571 --> 02:07:02.074
Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.

891
02:07:02.283 --> 02:07:05.077
-It isn't possible.
-Yes, it is.

892
02:07:05.411 --> 02:07:07.246
I did it.

893
02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:14.127
You'd better talk to Allenby.

894
02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:17.172
-General Allenby?
-He's in command. Murray's gone.

895
02:07:17.423 --> 02:07:19.675
That's a step in the right direction.

896
02:07:20.426 --> 02:07:23.178
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.

897
02:07:23.471 --> 02:07:26.181
-Yes, of course.
-It's for him.

898
02:07:27.934 --> 02:07:30.811
Right. You want a bed yourself,
don't you?

899
02:07:31.104 --> 02:07:33.105
See Allenby first, though.

900
02:07:33.773 --> 02:07:35.399
Will he see me?

901
02:07:36.150 --> 02:07:37.651
I think so.

902
02:07:38.403 --> 02:07:39.945
Do that, then.

903
02:07:44.826 --> 02:07:47.452
-I'd better shave.
-Yes, you had.

904
02:07:47.662 --> 02:07:50.289
You'd better get into
some trousers too.

905
02:08:01.467 --> 02:08:03.302
"Undisciplined.

906
02:08:05.179 --> 02:08:07.139
Unpunctual.

907
02:08:08.308 --> 02:08:10.225
Untidy.

908
02:08:12.061 --> 02:08:14.187
Several languages.

909
02:08:15.481 --> 02:08:17.482
Knowledge of music...

910
02:08:18.359 --> 02:08:20.152
...literature.

911
02:08:21.195 --> 02:08:23.155
Knowledge of....

912
02:08:24.532 --> 02:08:26.325
Knowledge of...."

913
02:08:29.537 --> 02:08:32.497
You're an interesting man,
there's no doubt about it.

914
02:08:33.166 --> 02:08:36.251
-Who told you to take Aqaba?
-Nobody.

915
02:08:36.544 --> 02:08:39.212
-Sir.
-Sir.

916
02:08:39.505 --> 02:08:40.839
Then why did you?

917
02:08:41.007 --> 02:08:43.508
-Aqaba's important.
-Why is it important?

918
02:08:43.718 --> 02:08:46.261
-It's the Turkish route to the canal.
-Not anymore.

919
02:08:46.512 --> 02:08:50.682
-They're coming through Beersheba.
-I know, but we've gone to Gaza.

920
02:08:50.850 --> 02:08:55.479
-So?
-So that left Aqaba behind your right.

921
02:08:56.022 --> 02:08:57.064
True.

922
02:08:57.273 --> 02:09:01.902
And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.

923
02:09:02.779 --> 02:09:05.197
Am I going for Jerusalem?

924
02:09:05.531 --> 02:09:06.698
Yes.

925
02:09:09.035 --> 02:09:10.494
Very well.

926
02:09:10.703 --> 02:09:12.996
Aqaba behind my right.

927
02:09:13.206 --> 02:09:16.083
It threatened El' Arîsh and Gaza.

928
02:09:17.543 --> 02:09:18.794
Anything else?

929
02:09:19.045 --> 02:09:20.253
Yes.

930
02:09:20.546 --> 02:09:23.006
Aqaba's linked with Medina.

931
02:09:23.549 --> 02:09:26.551
Do you think we should shift them
out of Medina now?

932
02:09:26.803 --> 02:09:30.389
No. I think you should
leave them there.

933
02:09:30.556 --> 02:09:32.557
You acted without orders, you know.

934
02:09:33.267 --> 02:09:37.521
Shouldn't officers use
their initiative at all times?

935
02:09:37.730 --> 02:09:40.065
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.

936
02:09:40.274 --> 02:09:42.609
Yes, I know.

937
02:09:42.902 --> 02:09:44.444
Already?

938
02:09:44.737 --> 02:09:45.904
Yes.

939
02:09:47.657 --> 02:09:50.283
I'm promoting you major.

940
02:09:51.285 --> 02:09:53.578
I don't think that's a very good idea.

941
02:09:53.746 --> 02:09:56.832
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...

942
02:09:57.083 --> 02:10:00.752
...and carry on the good work.

943
02:10:01.254 --> 02:10:04.089
No. Thank you, sir.

944
02:10:04.590 --> 02:10:08.552
-Why not?
-Well, I, it's....

945
02:10:08.761 --> 02:10:10.095
Let me see now....

946
02:10:11.806 --> 02:10:15.559
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.

947
02:10:15.768 --> 02:10:17.978
One was a boy.

948
02:10:18.187 --> 02:10:19.646
That was...

949
02:10:21.274 --> 02:10:23.108
...yesterday.

950
02:10:23.317 --> 02:10:25.360
I led him into a quicksand.

951
02:10:25.611 --> 02:10:27.279
The other was a man.

952
02:10:27.613 --> 02:10:29.573
That was...

953
02:10:29.782 --> 02:10:32.200
...before Aqaba, anyway.

954
02:10:32.869 --> 02:10:35.579
I had to execute him with my pistol.

955
02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:39.124
There was something about it
I didn't like.

956
02:10:39.375 --> 02:10:42.502
-Well, naturally.
-No. Something else.

957
02:10:44.797 --> 02:10:47.132
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.

958
02:10:47.341 --> 02:10:49.468
No. Something else.

959
02:10:51.095 --> 02:10:52.679
What, then?

960
02:10:53.598 --> 02:10:55.974
I enjoyed it.

961
02:11:03.483 --> 02:11:06.985
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.

962
02:11:08.738 --> 02:11:12.365
What do you mean coming dressed
like that? Amateur theatricals?

963
02:11:12.617 --> 02:11:14.326
Yes. Entirely.

964
02:11:14.535 --> 02:11:17.662
Let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is.

965
02:11:17.997 --> 02:11:19.998
Fascinating gear they wear.

966
02:11:20.249 --> 02:11:22.501
How would I look in this, Harry?

967
02:11:22.710 --> 02:11:26.213
-Damn ridiculous, sir.
-Here, you keep it.

968
02:11:27.131 --> 02:11:31.218
What I'm trying to say
is I don't think I'm fit for it.

969
02:11:31.427 --> 02:11:34.346
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

970
02:11:35.348 --> 02:11:39.935
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said
it couldn't be done.

971
02:11:40.269 --> 02:11:43.271
-Brighton?
-I know what he thinks.

972
02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:47.776
I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

973
02:11:48.152 --> 02:11:51.029
I don't think it matters
what his motives were.

974
02:11:51.239 --> 02:11:54.366
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

975
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:57.786
-Mr. Perkins!
-Sir!

976
02:11:58.037 --> 02:12:00.664
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

977
02:12:04.710 --> 02:12:08.088
-You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
-Yes, sir.

978
02:12:08.297 --> 02:12:12.592
-What do you think about it?
-Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.

979
02:12:12.802 --> 02:12:15.887
-Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
-Sir!

980
02:12:21.561 --> 02:12:23.186
Come on, then.

981
02:12:26.774 --> 02:12:28.567
You're a clever man, sir.

982
02:12:28.901 --> 02:12:32.487
No, but I know a good thing
when I see one.

983
02:12:32.738 --> 02:12:35.448
That's fair, surely?

984
02:12:55.970 --> 02:13:01.099
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.

985
02:13:01.309 --> 02:13:03.602
-Bravo.
-You know better?

986
02:13:23.164 --> 02:13:25.999
I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

987
02:13:26.250 --> 02:13:28.627
We should do very well indeed,
shouldn't we?

988
02:14:05.206 --> 02:14:07.666
Easy, gentlemen, please.

989
02:14:08.834 --> 02:14:11.044
-Give us something to drink.
-Of course, sir.

990
02:14:11.545 --> 02:14:15.173
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

991
02:14:15.925 --> 02:14:17.092
Tracy.

992
02:14:19.011 --> 02:14:20.845
Shall we go outside?

993
02:14:32.024 --> 02:14:35.318
So you hold bound the Turkish
desert army?

994
02:14:35.528 --> 02:14:36.569
Yes.

995
02:14:36.821 --> 02:14:39.114
With 1 000 Arabs?

996
02:14:40.199 --> 02:14:43.368
1 000 Arabs means 1 000 knives.

997
02:14:43.536 --> 02:14:45.537
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

998
02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:47.747
It means 1 000 camels.

999
02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:52.335
That means 1 000 packs of high
explosives and 1 000 crack rifles.

1000
02:14:52.878 --> 02:14:56.631
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.

1001
02:14:57.216 --> 02:14:59.134
I'll smash his railways.

1002
02:14:59.385 --> 02:15:01.886
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

1003
02:15:02.138 --> 02:15:04.931
In 1 3 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.

1004
02:15:05.224 --> 02:15:07.559
You are going back, then?

1005
02:15:10.396 --> 02:15:11.646
Yes.

1006
02:15:12.064 --> 02:15:14.399
Of course I'm going back.

1007
02:15:18.738 --> 02:15:21.156
Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.

1008
02:15:21.407 --> 02:15:25.660
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits...

1009
02:15:25.911 --> 02:15:27.078
...he'll withdraw.

1010
02:15:27.246 --> 02:15:29.998
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

1011
02:15:30.249 --> 02:15:32.751
If he gets out now,
he'll never get back again.

1012
02:15:33.002 --> 02:15:35.503
-I wonder who will.
-No one will.

1013
02:15:36.130 --> 02:15:38.381
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

1014
02:15:44.388 --> 02:15:46.681
That's what I've told them anyway.

1015
02:15:47.141 --> 02:15:48.975
That's what they think.

1016
02:15:49.435 --> 02:15:52.687
-That's why they're fighting.
-Oh, surely.

1017
02:15:55.649 --> 02:15:57.942
They've only one suspicion.

1018
02:15:58.402 --> 02:16:02.781
That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

1019
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:07.494
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1020
02:16:07.703 --> 02:16:08.787
Have we?

1021
02:16:09.288 --> 02:16:11.456
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1022
02:16:11.665 --> 02:16:14.793
Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?

1023
02:16:15.795 --> 02:16:18.046
Difficult question, sir.

1024
02:16:20.049 --> 02:16:23.843
I want to know, sir,
if I can tell them in your name...

1025
02:16:24.053 --> 02:16:27.472
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

1026
02:16:28.516 --> 02:16:30.016
Certainly.

1027
02:16:47.535 --> 02:16:50.995
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.

1028
02:16:51.205 --> 02:16:52.372
Right.

1029
02:16:52.665 --> 02:16:56.000
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.

1030
02:16:57.002 --> 02:17:00.380
-Instructors for the Lewis guns.
-Right.

1031
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:02.173
More money.

1032
02:17:02.508 --> 02:17:05.677
-How much more?
-25,000 now. A lot more later.

1033
02:17:05.886 --> 02:17:08.596
-Dryden?
-It can be done, sir.

1034
02:17:08.848 --> 02:17:11.683
A couple of armoured cars.

1035
02:17:11.851 --> 02:17:13.226
Right.

1036
02:17:13.978 --> 02:17:15.520
Field artillery.

1037
02:17:17.690 --> 02:17:19.065
Right.

1038
02:17:22.027 --> 02:17:24.279
I'll give you every
blessed thing l can...

1039
02:17:24.530 --> 02:17:27.407
...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.

1040
02:17:27.616 --> 02:17:30.368
Thank you for your hospitality,
gentlemen.

1041
02:18:06.030 --> 02:18:07.906
Congratulations!

1042
02:18:18.167 --> 02:18:21.252
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?

1043
02:18:21.462 --> 02:18:23.296
I was wondering that, sir.

1044
02:18:23.547 --> 02:18:25.757
Might be difficult to get it back.

1045
02:18:25.966 --> 02:18:29.552
Give them artillery and you've made
them independent.

1046
02:18:29.762 --> 02:18:31.679
Then I can't give it to them, can I?

1047
02:18:31.931 --> 02:18:33.848
-For you to say.
-No, it's not.

1048
02:18:34.099 --> 02:18:36.851
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

1049
02:18:37.102 --> 02:18:39.062
Not like that poor devil.

1050
02:18:39.563 --> 02:18:41.105
He's riding the whirlwind.

1051
02:18:41.315 --> 02:18:43.566
Let's hope we're not.

1052
02:24:07.307 --> 02:24:10.559
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?

1053
02:24:11.103 --> 02:24:12.311
To Prince Feisal.

1054
02:24:12.562 --> 02:24:15.314
-You're not Prince Feisal?
-No.

1055
02:24:15.607 --> 02:24:16.941
You know him though?

1056
02:24:17.109 --> 02:24:20.611
He is my master. I am his servant.

1057
02:24:23.782 --> 02:24:25.116
Can you read?

1058
02:24:33.792 --> 02:24:38.296
Chicago Courieris my paper,
but my work is syndicated in America.

1059
02:24:38.547 --> 02:24:42.091
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.

1060
02:24:56.273 --> 02:24:57.440
Now....

1061
02:24:58.650 --> 02:25:02.611
-Where can I find Major Lawrence?
-Is that what you have come for?

1062
02:25:02.821 --> 02:25:04.947
Not altogether, sir, no.

1063
02:25:05.198 --> 02:25:09.577
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

1064
02:25:09.786 --> 02:25:12.872
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?

1065
02:25:13.165 --> 02:25:14.332
I don't know.

1066
02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.668
-Last week they were near El Ghira.
-Ghira?

1067
02:25:17.878 --> 02:25:21.714
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

1068
02:25:22.674 --> 02:25:25.301
-I've never tried.
-Take a mule.

1069
02:25:25.844 --> 02:25:27.970
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.

1070
02:25:28.347 --> 02:25:30.973
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

1071
02:25:31.183 --> 02:25:32.475
They do.

1072
02:25:32.684 --> 02:25:35.853
But not so fast as we do,
you will find.

1073
02:25:36.188 --> 02:25:37.688
Myself...

1074
02:25:38.315 --> 02:25:40.191
...I am going to Cairo.

1075
02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:42.401
-As you know.
-Yes.

1076
02:25:42.652 --> 02:25:45.154
There's work for me there
of a different kind.

1077
02:25:45.697 --> 02:25:46.906
Yes.

1078
02:25:50.494 --> 02:25:52.870
I understand you've
been given no artillery.

1079
02:25:53.330 --> 02:25:55.873
-That is so.
-You're handicapped?

1080
02:25:56.041 --> 02:25:58.125
It restricts us to small things.

1081
02:25:58.335 --> 02:25:59.627
It's intended to.

1082
02:26:02.339 --> 02:26:03.923
Do you know General Allenby?

1083
02:26:04.925 --> 02:26:08.386
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.

1084
02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:11.389
-Excuse me?
-A clever man.

1085
02:26:11.681 --> 02:26:14.558
Slim customer. It's very good.

1086
02:26:14.851 --> 02:26:19.397
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.

1087
02:26:19.689 --> 02:26:23.192
Your Highness, we Americans were
once a colonial people.

1088
02:26:23.402 --> 02:26:25.778
We naturally feel
sympathetic to any people...

1089
02:26:26.029 --> 02:26:28.239
...who struggle for their freedom.

1090
02:26:28.407 --> 02:26:30.658
Very gratifying.

1091
02:26:33.412 --> 02:26:37.748
Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your story told.

1092
02:26:37.916 --> 02:26:40.251
I badly want a story to tell.

1093
02:26:40.460 --> 02:26:44.255
Ah, now you are talking turkey,
are you not?

1094
02:26:44.923 --> 02:26:47.758
I will give you a guide and a letter.

1095
02:26:47.968 --> 02:26:49.927
And before l leave here...

1096
02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:52.555
...which must be presently...

1097
02:26:52.764 --> 02:26:56.267
...I will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you.

1098
02:26:58.061 --> 02:27:01.313
You know that we are
destroying the Turkish railways.

1099
02:27:01.565 --> 02:27:02.690
I do, sir.

1100
02:27:02.899 --> 02:27:05.818
Major Lawrence is in charge
of all this, is he?

1101
02:27:06.069 --> 02:27:08.571
My army is made up of tribes.

1102
02:27:08.780 --> 02:27:11.782
The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.

1103
02:27:11.950 --> 02:27:15.119
Your people do think very highly
of Major Lawrence?

1104
02:27:15.328 --> 02:27:18.414
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

1105
02:27:18.999 --> 02:27:22.334
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

1106
02:27:23.211 --> 02:27:26.630
...the man who gives victory
in battle is prized...

1107
02:27:26.798 --> 02:27:29.467
...beyond every other man.

1108
02:27:30.135 --> 02:27:33.304
One figure I can give you
from my head...

1109
02:27:33.472 --> 02:27:37.141
...because it never leaves my head.

1110
02:27:37.642 --> 02:27:41.729
Since starting this campaign
four months ago, we have lost...

1111
02:27:42.647 --> 02:27:45.107
...37 wounded...

1112
02:27:47.652 --> 02:27:50.988
...1 56 dead.

1113
02:27:52.532 --> 02:27:57.328
You remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded.

1114
02:27:57.537 --> 02:27:58.829
Yeah.

1115
02:27:59.164 --> 02:28:00.539
Four times as many.

1116
02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:05.503
That's because those too wounded
to bring away, we ourselves kill.

1117
02:28:05.754 --> 02:28:08.255
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1118
02:28:08.673 --> 02:28:12.343
-You mean...?
-We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1119
02:28:12.844 --> 02:28:16.263
In their eyes, we are not
soldiers but rebels.

1120
02:28:16.473 --> 02:28:20.976
Rebels, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code...

1121
02:28:21.186 --> 02:28:23.062
...and are treated harshly.

1122
02:28:23.772 --> 02:28:24.855
How harshly?

1123
02:28:25.148 --> 02:28:28.025
More harshly than I hope
you can imagine.

1124
02:28:28.818 --> 02:28:29.860
I see.

1125
02:28:30.028 --> 02:28:33.280
Our own prisoners are taken care of
until the British...

1126
02:28:33.490 --> 02:28:37.326
...can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.

1127
02:28:37.536 --> 02:28:41.580
-I should like you to notice that.
-Yes, sir.

1128
02:28:42.582 --> 02:28:45.209
Is that the influence
of Major Lawrence?

1129
02:28:45.669 --> 02:28:47.044
Why should you suppose?

1130
02:28:47.295 --> 02:28:49.713
It's just that I heard
in Cairo that...

1131
02:28:49.923 --> 02:28:52.383
...Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.

1132
02:28:52.592 --> 02:28:54.301
That is exactly so.

1133
02:28:54.511 --> 02:28:58.013
With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.

1134
02:28:58.348 --> 02:29:01.225
With me, it is merely good manners.

1135
02:29:01.393 --> 02:29:05.563
You may judge which motive
is the more reliable.

1136
02:29:06.189 --> 02:29:09.567
-And now, perhaps....
-Oh, sure, sure.

1137
02:29:13.697 --> 02:29:15.364
Thank you, sir.

1138
02:29:15.574 --> 02:29:17.324
Can you manage the letter--?

1139
02:29:17.576 --> 02:29:20.411
I'll do everything I have said...

1140
02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:24.206
...if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest...

1141
02:29:24.416 --> 02:29:26.834
...in my people and Major Lawrence.

1142
02:29:28.753 --> 02:29:31.880
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.

1143
02:29:32.090 --> 02:29:34.592
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.

1144
02:29:34.926 --> 02:29:35.926
Oh, no.

1145
02:29:36.219 --> 02:29:39.972
But influential men back home believe
it's time for America...

1146
02:29:40.223 --> 02:29:42.933
...to lend her weight to
the struggle against Germany.

1147
02:29:43.143 --> 02:29:45.144
And Turkey.

1148
02:29:45.437 --> 02:29:49.773
I've been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is....

1149
02:29:50.275 --> 02:29:52.735
-Enjoyable?
-Hardly that, sir.

1150
02:29:52.944 --> 02:29:55.946
But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

1151
02:29:56.156 --> 02:29:59.783
You look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.

1152
02:30:01.369 --> 02:30:03.162
All right. Yes.

1153
02:30:03.788 --> 02:30:05.456
Lawrence is your man.

1154
02:30:45.330 --> 02:30:46.330
Stop!

1155
02:31:05.725 --> 02:31:09.561
Stop it!

1156
02:31:17.737 --> 02:31:19.238
Come on, men!

1157
02:32:28.433 --> 02:32:29.767
Lawrence!

1158
02:32:50.455 --> 02:32:52.456
Good God! God!

1159
02:33:38.837 --> 02:33:43.632
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed
with a sword before.

1160
02:33:43.883 --> 02:33:46.134
Why don't you take a picture?

1161
02:33:46.511 --> 02:33:47.803
Wish I had.

1162
02:33:52.016 --> 02:33:54.226
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

1163
02:33:56.479 --> 02:33:57.521
Am I in this?

1164
02:33:58.523 --> 02:34:00.232
Did you take his picture?

1165
02:34:00.483 --> 02:34:01.733
Yeah.

1166
02:34:06.155 --> 02:34:10.325
You are using up your nine lives
very quickly.

1167
02:34:12.829 --> 02:34:14.872
Charming company you keep.

1168
02:34:15.123 --> 02:34:16.373
Auda?

1169
02:34:17.166 --> 02:34:22.212
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue.

1170
02:34:22.547 --> 02:34:24.631
He thinks you're a kind of thief.

1171
02:34:24.883 --> 02:34:27.009
It's all right to take your picture?

1172
02:34:27.552 --> 02:34:29.052
-All right.
-Okay.

1173
02:34:29.262 --> 02:34:30.721
Just walk.

1174
02:35:30.949 --> 02:35:33.116
Major Lawrence!

1175
02:35:33.743 --> 02:35:36.453
Yes, sir, that's my baby.

1176
02:35:44.462 --> 02:35:47.089
This looting has got to stop!

1177
02:35:47.298 --> 02:35:48.632
It is customary.

1178
02:35:48.925 --> 02:35:52.469
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.

1179
02:35:52.762 --> 02:35:54.972
I would not say that to Auda.

1180
02:35:55.473 --> 02:35:58.266
-It is their payment, colonel.
-Payment.

1181
02:35:58.476 --> 02:36:01.269
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

1182
02:36:02.146 --> 02:36:05.482
-They don't go home when being paid.
-They are not free to.

1183
02:36:10.279 --> 02:36:14.366
Well, there's another lot you've
seen the last of.

1184
02:36:14.659 --> 02:36:16.284
They'll come back.

1185
02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:20.038
He says they'll come back.
Will they?

1186
02:36:20.331 --> 02:36:22.499
Not this year, Lawrence.

1187
02:36:23.251 --> 02:36:27.671
Look, Lawrence, how many men do
you think you'll have left? 200?

1188
02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:30.674
-Less.
-Well, then?

1189
02:36:31.009 --> 02:36:33.343
I said, they'll come back.

1190
02:36:34.053 --> 02:36:35.262
You badly hurt?

1191
02:36:36.806 --> 02:36:38.557
Not hurt at all.

1192
02:36:38.808 --> 02:36:42.978
Didn't you know? They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.

1193
02:36:58.703 --> 02:37:02.539
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.

1194
02:37:02.999 --> 02:37:06.543
-What are you learning from this?
-Politics.

1195
02:37:07.211 --> 02:37:11.715
You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

1196
02:37:12.383 --> 02:37:14.676
I will tell you that
when I have a country.

1197
02:37:16.929 --> 02:37:18.221
Did I answer well?

1198
02:37:18.598 --> 02:37:22.809
You answered without
saying anything. That's politics.

1199
02:37:24.062 --> 02:37:25.729
You learn quickly.

1200
02:37:27.065 --> 02:37:29.232
I have a good teacher.

1201
02:37:31.861 --> 02:37:33.236
Yeah.

1202
02:37:40.953 --> 02:37:42.829
-How's your hurt?
-Fine.

1203
02:37:43.039 --> 02:37:47.876
Before I return to the fleshpots,
which I shall be very glad to do...

1204
02:37:48.086 --> 02:37:51.129
...may I put two questions to you,
straight?

1205
02:37:51.422 --> 02:37:54.758
I'd be interested to hear you put
a question straight.

1206
02:37:54.967 --> 02:37:56.134
One.

1207
02:37:56.594 --> 02:38:00.555
What, in your opinion, do these people
hope to gain from this war?

1208
02:38:00.848 --> 02:38:03.266
They hope to gain their freedom.

1209
02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:05.602
Freedom.

1210
02:38:06.896 --> 02:38:09.731
"They hope to gain their freedom."

1211
02:38:09.941 --> 02:38:13.610
-There's one born every minute.
-They're going to get it.

1212
02:38:14.403 --> 02:38:16.613
I'm going to give it to them.

1213
02:38:18.282 --> 02:38:24.121
-The second question?
-Well, I was going to ask...

1214
02:38:24.622 --> 02:38:28.583
...what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert?

1215
02:38:30.586 --> 02:38:32.629
It's clean.

1216
02:38:35.466 --> 02:38:37.008
Well, now...

1217
02:38:37.885 --> 02:38:40.011
...that's a very illuminating answer.

1218
02:38:40.388 --> 02:38:42.013
May I...

1219
02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:45.142
...take one farewell picture?

1220
02:38:45.977 --> 02:38:49.020
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

1221
02:38:49.313 --> 02:38:52.274
One clock for two lamps.

1222
02:38:52.775 --> 02:38:53.984
A fair bargain.

1223
02:38:54.193 --> 02:38:56.820
Fair? l robbed him.

1224
02:39:08.291 --> 02:39:09.791
Trash.

1225
02:39:10.918 --> 02:39:13.336
I must find something honourable.

1226
02:39:13.629 --> 02:39:15.172
Honourable?

1227
02:39:15.798 --> 02:39:19.551
The year is running out, Brighton.

1228
02:39:23.973 --> 02:39:26.975
I must find something honourable.

1229
02:41:58.502 --> 02:42:00.670
Now you may blow up my train.

1230
02:42:00.963 --> 02:42:02.672
And what will you do now?

1231
02:42:02.882 --> 02:42:07.469
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.

1232
02:42:08.220 --> 02:42:10.221
They will carry my toys too, see?

1233
02:42:10.639 --> 02:42:13.683
Major Lawrence will campaign
this winter.

1234
02:42:13.976 --> 02:42:17.354
But you got what you wanted,
so you're going home, is that it?

1235
02:42:17.521 --> 02:42:22.192
Of course. When Lawrence has got
what he wants, he will go home.

1236
02:42:22.401 --> 02:42:24.986
When you've got what you want,
you will go home.

1237
02:42:25.196 --> 02:42:26.863
No, I shan't, Auda.

1238
02:42:27.656 --> 02:42:29.032
Then you are a fool.

1239
02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:32.702
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

1240
02:42:33.829 --> 02:42:36.039
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

1241
02:42:36.248 --> 02:42:39.376
...that when he made you a fool,
he gave you a fool's face.

1242
02:42:40.628 --> 02:42:42.712
You are an impudent rascal.

1243
02:42:44.215 --> 02:42:48.551
I must go, Lawrence, before I
soil myself with a fool's blood.

1244
02:42:58.938 --> 02:43:00.688
Like talking to a brick wall.

1245
02:43:09.365 --> 02:43:12.033
So what will you do now?
What can you do?

1246
02:43:12.701 --> 02:43:14.411
I'll go north.

1247
02:43:15.746 --> 02:43:17.580
That's what Allenby wants.

1248
02:43:17.790 --> 02:43:21.918
Allenby wanted the Arab army
behind Deraa.

1249
02:43:22.169 --> 02:43:24.421
Then that's where I'll take it.

1250
02:43:25.423 --> 02:43:30.260
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be
in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.

1251
02:43:30.553 --> 02:43:31.719
Won't we?

1252
02:44:04.211 --> 02:44:05.253
Train, Farraj.

1253
02:44:06.297 --> 02:44:07.797
Yeah, Lawrence.

1254
02:44:36.994 --> 02:44:38.828
Hide yourself, my friend.

1255
02:44:48.047 --> 02:44:49.506
Detonator.

1256
02:45:03.020 --> 02:45:04.687
All right, fetch another.

1257
02:45:04.897 --> 02:45:08.691
-Pardon, Lawrence. I put--
-Plenty of time. Fetch another.

1258
02:45:14.156 --> 02:45:15.532
Farraj?

1259
02:45:25.834 --> 02:45:28.878
-What happened?
-Detonator. A detonator!

1260
02:45:42.393 --> 02:45:44.894
He cannot ride, Lawrence. Look.

1261
02:45:54.405 --> 02:45:57.240
If they take him alive,
you know what they'll do to him.

1262
02:46:09.628 --> 02:46:12.088
Daud will be angry with you.

1263
02:46:13.090 --> 02:46:14.966
Salute him for me.

1264
02:46:34.778 --> 02:46:36.446
What will you do now?

1265
02:46:37.906 --> 02:46:39.407
Go north.

1266
02:46:39.617 --> 02:46:41.075
With twenty?

1267
02:46:41.952 --> 02:46:44.412
What would
you recommend me to do?

1268
02:46:46.123 --> 02:46:48.124
What would you recommend?

1269
02:46:53.130 --> 02:46:55.465
He hasn't 1/1 0 so many men, sir.

1270
02:46:55.633 --> 02:46:57.508
He's lied, in fact.

1271
02:46:58.886 --> 02:47:02.597
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have
done anything he hasn't done.

1272
02:47:02.806 --> 02:47:05.475
Then there is an Arab north army.

1273
02:47:06.977 --> 02:47:11.481
-No, sir, he has lied about that.
-Any idea why?

1274
02:47:11.899 --> 02:47:15.902
-It's his army, I suppose.
-It's Prince Feisal's army.

1275
02:47:17.321 --> 02:47:19.822
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?

1276
02:47:21.158 --> 02:47:22.784
No.

1277
02:47:23.827 --> 02:47:27.538
He would if he could, I think.

1278
02:47:29.333 --> 02:47:32.794
-Not my line of country.
-It doesn't matter. Just curious.

1279
02:47:33.504 --> 02:47:35.713
What matters is I believed it.

1280
02:47:36.006 --> 02:47:37.674
The Turks believe it.

1281
02:47:37.966 --> 02:47:41.344
They are offering 20,000 pounds
for him.

1282
02:47:43.305 --> 02:47:45.056
Good heavens.

1283
02:47:45.516 --> 02:47:49.227
-Shouldn't say he had long to live.
-Whatever else, he's a brave man--

1284
02:47:49.478 --> 02:47:53.856
Surely, surely. If he's still going north
with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.

1285
02:47:55.025 --> 02:47:57.819
I wonder if they'd offer that much
for me.

1286
02:47:59.530 --> 02:48:03.658
What about next year?
Will they still come back?

1287
02:48:03.867 --> 02:48:05.868
I wouldn't be surprised.

1288
02:48:06.078 --> 02:48:09.706
-They think he's a kind of prophet.
-They do or he does?

1289
02:48:25.347 --> 02:48:27.890
-Now may I speak?
-Yes.

1290
02:48:28.559 --> 02:48:31.728
One more failure and you will find
yourself alone.

1291
02:48:33.105 --> 02:48:36.607
-I do not include myself.
-I do not include the others.

1292
02:48:36.900 --> 02:48:39.068
So say they love you.

1293
02:48:39.528 --> 02:48:42.029
The more reason to be thrifty
with them.

1294
02:48:42.239 --> 02:48:45.366
Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.

1295
02:48:45.576 --> 02:48:47.744
They must move mountains,
walk on water.

1296
02:48:47.995 --> 02:48:51.205
That's right. That's right.

1297
02:48:51.790 --> 02:48:54.292
Who are you to know
what can be done?

1298
02:48:54.752 --> 02:48:58.421
If we'd done what you thought could
be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.

1299
02:48:59.006 --> 02:49:03.426
Whatever I ask them to do can
be done. They know that if you don't.

1300
02:49:05.554 --> 02:49:08.514
Do you think I'm just anybody?

1301
02:49:09.016 --> 02:49:10.391
Do you?

1302
02:49:13.604 --> 02:49:16.939
My friends, who will walk on water
with me?

1303
02:49:20.402 --> 02:49:24.781
-Who will come with me into Deraa?
-Deraa is garrisoned.

1304
02:49:24.948 --> 02:49:27.074
Will you take 20 against 2000?

1305
02:49:27.284 --> 02:49:31.037
-I'll go by myself if I have to.
-Why?

1306
02:49:31.288 --> 02:49:33.122
Because I told the English generals...

1307
02:49:33.415 --> 02:49:37.043
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they'd be in Jerusalem.

1308
02:49:37.461 --> 02:49:39.587
Or perhaps you are here...

1309
02:49:40.172 --> 02:49:42.131
...for the English generals.

1310
02:49:44.176 --> 02:49:45.843
Who says this?

1311
02:49:46.136 --> 02:49:47.470
Rumour.

1312
02:49:48.806 --> 02:49:51.307
That is not an argument.

1313
02:49:51.558 --> 02:49:53.768
Oh, argument.

1314
02:49:53.977 --> 02:49:57.313
This afternoon I will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa...

1315
02:49:57.606 --> 02:49:59.982
...while the Arabs argue.

1316
02:50:01.944 --> 02:50:05.071
Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?

1317
02:50:05.447 --> 02:50:09.200
Yes. If one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes.

1318
02:50:18.460 --> 02:50:19.669
It's madness.

1319
02:50:23.173 --> 02:50:24.966
What are you looking for?

1320
02:50:25.175 --> 02:50:27.677
Some way to announce myself.

1321
02:50:27.886 --> 02:50:29.846
Be patient with him, God.

1322
02:50:43.235 --> 02:50:47.530
-Do you not see how they look at you?
-Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

1323
02:50:47.698 --> 02:50:49.031
Halt!

1324
02:50:49.241 --> 02:50:50.491
Walk on.

1325
02:50:50.701 --> 02:50:52.535
-Halt!
-Walk on.

1326
02:50:53.704 --> 02:50:55.872
You and you.

1327
02:52:37.015 --> 02:52:38.099
You.

1328
02:52:54.658 --> 02:52:56.659
You have blue eyes.

1329
02:52:57.536 --> 02:53:01.789
-I say you have blue eyes.
-Yes, effendi.

1330
02:53:01.999 --> 02:53:05.292
-Are you Circassian?
-Yes, effendi.

1331
02:53:06.169 --> 02:53:07.753
How old are you?

1332
02:53:08.005 --> 02:53:11.007
Twenty-seven, effendi.

1333
02:53:11.258 --> 02:53:13.134
I think.

1334
02:53:13.343 --> 02:53:17.888
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.

1335
02:53:19.182 --> 02:53:21.267
It's an interesting face.

1336
02:53:25.897 --> 02:53:28.357
I am surrounded by cattle.

1337
02:53:29.026 --> 02:53:32.695
He wouldn't know an interesting face
from a sow's belly.

1338
02:53:33.697 --> 02:53:37.700
I have been is Deraa now
for three and a half years.

1339
02:53:37.909 --> 02:53:42.329
If they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, I could not be more...

1340
02:53:42.539 --> 02:53:44.373
...isolated.

1341
02:53:46.293 --> 02:53:48.878
You haven't the least idea
what l'm talking about.

1342
02:53:49.171 --> 02:53:50.880
No, effendi.

1343
02:53:53.425 --> 02:53:54.842
Have you?

1344
02:53:56.053 --> 02:53:57.344
No.

1345
02:53:58.055 --> 02:53:59.889
That would be too...

1346
02:54:00.098 --> 02:54:01.724
...lucky.

1347
02:54:26.208 --> 02:54:27.958
Where did you get that?

1348
02:54:29.878 --> 02:54:34.048
-It's old, effendi.
-No, this is recent.

1349
02:54:36.093 --> 02:54:38.344
-You are a deserter.
-No, effendi.

1350
02:54:38.595 --> 02:54:40.471
Yes, you are a deserter.

1351
02:54:41.598 --> 02:54:43.849
But from which army?

1352
02:54:46.353 --> 02:54:48.604
Not that it matters at all.

1353
02:54:48.939 --> 02:54:51.273
A man cannot be always in uniform.

1354
02:55:02.786 --> 02:55:04.745
Your skin is very fair.

1355
02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:24.932
Beat him.

1356
02:56:59.486 --> 02:57:00.861
To me!

1357
02:59:03.360 --> 02:59:04.960
Sleep.

1358
02:59:20.043 --> 02:59:21.643
Eat.

1359
02:59:32.347 --> 02:59:35.182
You have a body, like other men.

1360
02:59:43.691 --> 02:59:44.733
Good.

1361
02:59:45.902 --> 02:59:47.694
Then sleep.

1362
03:00:01.209 --> 03:00:02.459
Better?

1363
03:00:03.086 --> 03:00:05.796
Much better. You were right.

1364
03:00:06.089 --> 03:00:08.257
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

1365
03:00:09.217 --> 03:00:11.260
Oh, l've learned all right.

1366
03:00:17.058 --> 03:00:18.767
I'm going, Ali.

1367
03:00:19.811 --> 03:00:21.937
-Why?
-Why?

1368
03:00:23.231 --> 03:00:24.481
Heavens.

1369
03:00:24.774 --> 03:00:26.066
Why?

1370
03:00:26.943 --> 03:00:29.194
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.

1371
03:00:29.446 --> 03:00:31.447
And the end of the Arab revolt?

1372
03:00:31.739 --> 03:00:34.825
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.

1373
03:00:35.118 --> 03:00:38.120
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.

1374
03:00:38.413 --> 03:00:41.415
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

1375
03:00:41.624 --> 03:00:43.584
You proved it.

1376
03:00:43.793 --> 03:00:45.961
Look, Ali. Look.

1377
03:00:46.254 --> 03:00:50.007
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.

1378
03:00:50.800 --> 03:00:53.135
And there's nothing I can do about it.

1379
03:00:53.303 --> 03:00:55.971
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.

1380
03:00:57.765 --> 03:00:59.224
He can...

1381
03:00:59.434 --> 03:01:02.311
...but he can't want what he wants.

1382
03:01:03.271 --> 03:01:06.482
This is the stuff that decides what
he wants.

1383
03:01:09.319 --> 03:01:13.113
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.

1384
03:01:13.323 --> 03:01:17.284
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.

1385
03:01:17.494 --> 03:01:20.287
-I tried to.
-So would any man.

1386
03:01:20.497 --> 03:01:23.999
Well, any man is what l am.

1387
03:01:25.001 --> 03:01:29.004
And l'm going back to Allenby to
ask him for a job...

1388
03:01:29.297 --> 03:01:31.340
...that any man can do.

1389
03:01:31.633 --> 03:01:33.509
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

1390
03:01:33.801 --> 03:01:36.512
-I'll make easy stages.
-You?

1391
03:01:38.056 --> 03:01:41.517
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1392
03:01:43.311 --> 03:01:47.856
Look, Ali, I think l see
a way of being just...

1393
03:01:48.066 --> 03:01:49.691
...ordinarily...

1394
03:01:50.360 --> 03:01:51.777
...happy.

1395
03:01:55.573 --> 03:01:57.199
Can I take this?

1396
03:01:57.825 --> 03:01:59.701
It is not clean.

1397
03:01:59.994 --> 03:02:03.038
No, but it's warm.

1398
03:02:03.414 --> 03:02:04.706
And these...

1399
03:02:04.916 --> 03:02:08.877
...having led them here,
have you no care for them?

1400
03:02:10.380 --> 03:02:15.551
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

1401
03:02:17.804 --> 03:02:20.013
And let me go back to mine.

1402
03:02:49.127 --> 03:02:52.254
-I say, don't forget those form fives.
-All right.

1403
03:02:58.094 --> 03:02:59.928
Mind if l join you?

1404
03:03:00.763 --> 03:03:02.431
Honoured, sir.

1405
03:03:04.767 --> 03:03:08.103
-Good to be back.
-We heard you were, sir.

1406
03:03:08.646 --> 03:03:11.231
-What's doing out there?
-Where?

1407
03:03:11.441 --> 03:03:13.734
-Arabia?
-Well, yes, sir.

1408
03:03:13.943 --> 03:03:17.279
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?

1409
03:03:17.572 --> 03:03:19.948
We're settling in.
We built a squash court.

1410
03:03:20.158 --> 03:03:21.617
Jolly good.

1411
03:03:22.452 --> 03:03:26.455
Well, I have to go up there.

1412
03:03:27.457 --> 03:03:29.916
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

1413
03:03:30.126 --> 03:03:31.877
Bloody wogs.

1414
03:03:33.296 --> 03:03:35.172
Yes, probably.

1415
03:03:35.923 --> 03:03:38.300
Jolly good about the squash court.

1416
03:03:41.012 --> 03:03:43.513
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

1417
03:03:56.778 --> 03:03:58.028
Morning.

1418
03:03:58.196 --> 03:03:59.988
-Good morning, sir.
-Good to be back.

1419
03:04:00.281 --> 03:04:03.325
-I'll believe you, sir.
-No, really it is.

1420
03:04:06.621 --> 03:04:07.954
Hello.

1421
03:04:08.539 --> 03:04:11.667
Morning. You're to go right in.

1422
03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:25.180
Lawrence.

1423
03:04:26.974 --> 03:04:29.518
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1424
03:04:30.186 --> 03:04:31.561
Sir.

1425
03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:39.194
Well, general, I will leave you.

1426
03:04:39.487 --> 03:04:42.364
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make...

1427
03:04:42.657 --> 03:04:46.451
...about my people
and their weakness...

1428
03:04:46.703 --> 03:04:51.498
...and the need to keep them
in the British interest.

1429
03:04:54.001 --> 03:04:57.546
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.

1430
03:04:57.714 --> 03:04:59.756
I told you, sir, no such treaty exists.

1431
03:05:00.049 --> 03:05:04.511
Yes, general, you have lied
most bravely, but not convincingly.

1432
03:05:04.721 --> 03:05:06.722
I know this treaty does exist.

1433
03:05:06.973 --> 03:05:08.890
Treaty, sir?

1434
03:05:11.060 --> 03:05:13.061
He does it better than you, general.

1435
03:05:13.354 --> 03:05:16.606
But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.

1436
03:05:30.788 --> 03:05:32.414
You really don't know?

1437
03:05:34.751 --> 03:05:36.752
Then what the devil's this?

1438
03:05:37.754 --> 03:05:41.631
It's my request
for release from Arabia, sir.

1439
03:05:41.883 --> 03:05:43.258
For what reason?

1440
03:05:43.426 --> 03:05:45.761
You sure you haven't heard
of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1441
03:05:45.928 --> 03:05:47.304
No.

1442
03:05:48.097 --> 03:05:51.266
-I can guess.
-Don't guess. Tell him.

1443
03:05:53.060 --> 03:05:54.436
Well, now....

1444
03:05:54.896 --> 03:05:57.939
Mr. Sykes is an English civil servant.

1445
03:05:58.149 --> 03:06:01.276
Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

1446
03:06:01.444 --> 03:06:05.655
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war...

1447
03:06:05.948 --> 03:06:09.284
...France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

1448
03:06:09.577 --> 03:06:11.286
Including Arabia.

1449
03:06:11.579 --> 03:06:15.624
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

1450
03:06:15.833 --> 03:06:18.960
An agreement to that effect.

1451
03:06:19.629 --> 03:06:23.173
There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

1452
03:06:23.466 --> 03:06:26.176
And let's have
no displays of indignation.

1453
03:06:26.469 --> 03:06:29.596
You may not have known,
but you certainly had suspicions.

1454
03:06:30.097 --> 03:06:33.433
If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.

1455
03:06:33.643 --> 03:06:38.104
And a man who tells lies, like me,
merely hides the truth.

1456
03:06:38.314 --> 03:06:43.068
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

1457
03:06:43.653 --> 03:06:46.947
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.

1458
03:06:47.448 --> 03:06:49.825
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1459
03:06:51.327 --> 03:06:53.328
And l want an ordinary job, sir.

1460
03:06:53.579 --> 03:06:55.872
That's my reason for resigning.

1461
03:06:57.166 --> 03:06:58.834
It's personal.

1462
03:06:59.001 --> 03:07:01.211
-Personal?
-Yes, sir.

1463
03:07:01.504 --> 03:07:04.589
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.

1464
03:07:04.841 --> 03:07:08.176
And as it happens, a damned
important one. Are you mad?

1465
03:07:08.469 --> 03:07:11.680
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

1466
03:07:11.889 --> 03:07:13.974
That's my reason too.

1467
03:07:14.141 --> 03:07:19.187
Look, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 1 6th of next month...

1468
03:07:19.355 --> 03:07:21.356
...and you are part of it.

1469
03:07:21.858 --> 03:07:25.527
Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!

1470
03:07:25.736 --> 03:07:29.656
I don't want to be part
of your big push!

1471
03:07:30.366 --> 03:07:32.409
What about your Arab friends?

1472
03:07:32.660 --> 03:07:36.496
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!

1473
03:07:36.706 --> 03:07:38.874
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

1474
03:07:39.125 --> 03:07:44.212
I've told you, I just want
my ration of common humanity.

1475
03:07:44.505 --> 03:07:47.382
-Lawrence.
-Yes?

1476
03:07:50.136 --> 03:07:52.888
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

1477
03:07:53.139 --> 03:07:55.223
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1478
03:07:55.516 --> 03:07:57.225
Thank you, sir.

1479
03:07:58.269 --> 03:08:00.520
Why don't we...?

1480
03:08:03.065 --> 03:08:04.900
There's blood on your back.

1481
03:08:06.193 --> 03:08:09.279
-Do you want a doctor?
-No.

1482
03:08:10.448 --> 03:08:12.657
Tell me what happened.

1483
03:08:17.580 --> 03:08:19.748
Say, what goes on in there?

1484
03:08:20.541 --> 03:08:22.417
-Nothing.
-Oh, come on!

1485
03:08:22.668 --> 03:08:26.087
-No, really. Nothing at all.
-Is the man in trouble?

1486
03:08:26.297 --> 03:08:30.258
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

1487
03:08:30.551 --> 03:08:34.429
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.

1488
03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:38.099
-What claim?
-I've made that boy a hero.

1489
03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:41.061
When the war's over,
he can be anything he wants.

1490
03:08:41.270 --> 03:08:45.607
Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.

1491
03:08:46.108 --> 03:08:48.944
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

1492
03:08:49.487 --> 03:08:51.947
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

1493
03:08:52.239 --> 03:08:54.991
Always walking away, aren't you?

1494
03:08:55.284 --> 03:08:56.785
Well, I'll tell you.

1495
03:08:56.994 --> 03:08:59.955
It's a clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

1496
03:09:00.206 --> 03:09:03.124
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...

1497
03:09:03.334 --> 03:09:06.127
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

1498
03:09:06.963 --> 03:09:09.965
I believe your name will
be a household word...

1499
03:09:10.466 --> 03:09:14.135
...when you'd have to go to the
war museum to find who Allenby was.

1500
03:09:15.012 --> 03:09:17.931
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.

1501
03:09:18.516 --> 03:09:20.016
Leave me alone.

1502
03:09:20.309 --> 03:09:22.811
-Leave me alone.
-That's a feeble thing to say.

1503
03:09:23.020 --> 03:09:25.647
-I know I'm not ordinary.
-That's not what I'm saying.

1504
03:09:25.856 --> 03:09:28.650
All right, l'm extraordinary.

1505
03:09:30.653 --> 03:09:31.736
What of it?

1506
03:09:32.113 --> 03:09:34.823
Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.

1507
03:09:34.991 --> 03:09:38.159
It's a terrible thing
for a man to flunk it if he has.

1508
03:09:38.327 --> 03:09:40.495
Are you speaking from experience?

1509
03:09:40.788 --> 03:09:42.163
No.

1510
03:09:42.331 --> 03:09:44.165
You're guessing, then.

1511
03:09:45.334 --> 03:09:46.668
Suppose you're wrong.

1512
03:09:46.961 --> 03:09:50.005
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

1513
03:09:50.840 --> 03:09:53.800
-Yes. I said, yes.
-After all--

1514
03:09:56.345 --> 03:09:58.388
-The 1 6th?
-Can you do it?

1515
03:09:58.556 --> 03:10:00.682
I'll give you a lot of money.

1516
03:10:00.975 --> 03:10:03.810
-Artillery?
-I can't.

1517
03:10:05.021 --> 03:10:07.981
They won't be coming for money,
not the best of them.

1518
03:10:08.274 --> 03:10:10.483
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1519
03:10:11.527 --> 03:10:13.570
Which I'm going to give them.

1520
03:10:14.321 --> 03:10:16.072
That's all I want.

1521
03:10:17.158 --> 03:10:20.035
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

1522
03:10:20.286 --> 03:10:24.539
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

1523
03:10:24.832 --> 03:10:28.001
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.

1524
03:10:28.210 --> 03:10:30.587
Tell the politicians
to burn their paper now.

1525
03:10:30.838 --> 03:10:32.172
Fair enough.

1526
03:10:32.673 --> 03:10:35.550
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

1527
03:10:36.302 --> 03:10:38.219
It's going to happen.

1528
03:10:38.888 --> 03:10:41.014
I shall want quite a lot of money.

1529
03:10:41.724 --> 03:10:43.391
All there is.

1530
03:10:43.893 --> 03:10:45.518
Not that much.

1531
03:10:48.814 --> 03:10:51.566
The best of them
won't come for money.

1532
03:10:53.444 --> 03:10:54.861
They'll come for me.

1533
03:11:13.339 --> 03:11:14.589
No pictures!

1534
03:11:14.882 --> 03:11:17.217
It's not for you, it's for Major Lawrence.

1535
03:11:17.426 --> 03:11:21.596
He doesn't mind having his picture
taken. He doesn't mind at all.

1536
03:11:21.847 --> 03:11:24.099
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

1537
03:11:28.562 --> 03:11:31.147
Have you met Major Lawrence
since he's come back?

1538
03:11:31.440 --> 03:11:32.732
Yes.

1539
03:11:32.900 --> 03:11:35.276
-Changed, hasn't he?
-No.

1540
03:11:35.444 --> 03:11:38.363
Oh, l'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.

1541
03:11:43.119 --> 03:11:46.788
What did that Turkish general
do to him in Deraa?

1542
03:11:47.498 --> 03:11:52.293
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.

1543
03:11:53.963 --> 03:11:56.506
What did the English general
do to him in Jerusalem?

1544
03:11:56.799 --> 03:11:58.466
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

1545
03:11:58.676 --> 03:12:00.635
-I did.
-What did he say?

1546
03:12:00.886 --> 03:12:02.470
He laughed.

1547
03:12:02.972 --> 03:12:05.598
He told me to gather the Harith here.

1548
03:12:06.142 --> 03:12:07.684
He offered me money.

1549
03:12:07.977 --> 03:12:09.519
Did you take it?

1550
03:12:10.312 --> 03:12:12.939
No. But many did.

1551
03:12:50.686 --> 03:12:53.730
-What is this?
-This is my bodyguard.

1552
03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:57.066
There is not a man
without a price on his head.

1553
03:12:57.359 --> 03:13:00.987
-There's a price on my head too.
-But these are murderers.

1554
03:13:01.197 --> 03:13:03.198
The sheiks will hang these men.

1555
03:13:03.449 --> 03:13:05.200
These men are mine.

1556
03:13:05.701 --> 03:13:10.038
Lawrence, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.

1557
03:13:10.372 --> 03:13:13.833
-You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
-Sherif?

1558
03:13:14.043 --> 03:13:17.045
-Where do we ride?
-Damascus, sherif.

1559
03:13:17.254 --> 03:13:19.172
Aye, but for what?

1560
03:13:19.381 --> 03:13:21.549
Sherif, for Lawrence.

1561
03:13:24.678 --> 03:13:28.014
-You have bought these things.
-I bought half the men here, Ali.

1562
03:13:28.224 --> 03:13:31.017
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.

1563
03:13:31.227 --> 03:13:34.229
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!

1564
03:13:38.234 --> 03:13:40.068
Damascus!

1565
03:13:40.277 --> 03:13:45.698
Damascus! Damascus!

1566
03:14:19.566 --> 03:14:23.111
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's
gone through Mazril and Deraa.

1567
03:14:23.404 --> 03:14:27.031
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.

1568
03:14:27.241 --> 03:14:30.910
If the enemy's retreating in
any order, which we'll assume--

1569
03:14:31.078 --> 03:14:32.120
Certainly.

1570
03:14:32.288 --> 03:14:34.038
He can't be far from Mallud...

1571
03:14:34.665 --> 03:14:38.960
...in which case I can have him
within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

1572
03:14:39.253 --> 03:14:41.254
Splendid. Philip.

1573
03:14:41.630 --> 03:14:44.299
These are the last infantry supports
going up now.

1574
03:14:44.591 --> 03:14:48.136
But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

1575
03:14:48.804 --> 03:14:52.265
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.

1576
03:14:52.433 --> 03:14:53.683
Any questions?

1577
03:14:54.143 --> 03:14:58.271
This Arab army on the right, sir,
what's it consist of?

1578
03:14:58.772 --> 03:15:00.982
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.

1579
03:15:01.150 --> 03:15:03.067
Where are they now?

1580
03:15:03.777 --> 03:15:08.656
-Can only know by being with them.
-Then get with them. I want to know.

1581
03:15:08.991 --> 03:15:11.284
Pound them, Charley.

1582
03:15:11.869 --> 03:15:13.286
Pound them.

1583
03:15:23.839 --> 03:15:26.674
God help the men who lie under that.

1584
03:15:26.884 --> 03:15:28.509
They're Turks.

1585
03:15:28.719 --> 03:15:30.386
God help them.

1586
03:16:13.138 --> 03:16:16.891
Well, he's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1587
03:16:17.142 --> 03:16:18.434
Cocky?

1588
03:16:18.644 --> 03:16:20.395
More than cocky, sir.

1589
03:16:20.687 --> 03:16:24.023
He's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1590
03:16:24.233 --> 03:16:27.735
I tell you, sir, I think
he'll get to Damascus before we do.

1591
03:16:28.404 --> 03:16:30.238
-Unless....
-Unless?

1592
03:16:30.406 --> 03:16:34.283
Well, there's a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.

1593
03:16:34.576 --> 03:16:37.537
-What do the Turks have in Mazril?
-A brigade, sir.

1594
03:16:40.541 --> 03:16:42.750
I wonder where they are now.

1595
03:18:24.811 --> 03:18:25.978
No prisoners.

1596
03:18:29.483 --> 03:18:31.567
Damascus, Lawrence.

1597
03:18:41.495 --> 03:18:44.330
Lawrence, not this.

1598
03:18:45.040 --> 03:18:49.043
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

1599
03:18:49.795 --> 03:18:51.379
No prisoners.

1600
03:19:01.515 --> 03:19:03.099
This was Talaal's village.

1601
03:19:07.354 --> 03:19:08.954
Talaal!

1602
03:19:29.626 --> 03:19:33.212
No prisoners!

1603
03:19:45.100 --> 03:19:46.700
God.

1604
03:19:53.400 --> 03:19:54.775
God!

1605
03:22:12.080 --> 03:22:15.249
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!

1606
03:23:52.639 --> 03:23:53.848
Major!

1607
03:23:54.516 --> 03:23:56.183
Major Lawrence!

1608
03:24:01.857 --> 03:24:03.857
Jesus wept.

1609
03:24:22.210 --> 03:24:24.253
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

1610
03:24:24.880 --> 03:24:27.673
Surely you know
the Arabs are a barbarous people.

1611
03:24:27.883 --> 03:24:29.717
Barbarous and cruel.

1612
03:24:30.552 --> 03:24:34.179
Who but they?

1613
03:24:36.516 --> 03:24:38.893
Oh, you rotten man.

1614
03:24:39.936 --> 03:24:44.356
Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.

1615
03:24:46.443 --> 03:24:48.569
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

1616
03:25:15.055 --> 03:25:18.557
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.

1617
03:25:18.975 --> 03:25:20.684
Damascus!

1618
03:25:20.894 --> 03:25:22.770
Take them to Sherif Ali.

1619
03:25:22.979 --> 03:25:24.396
Tell him.

1620
03:25:25.398 --> 03:25:27.107
Remind him.

1621
03:25:27.943 --> 03:25:31.070
-Is Allenby in Damascus?
-Near.

1622
03:25:31.905 --> 03:25:34.198
Tell Sherif Ali that.

1623
03:25:35.450 --> 03:25:37.284
They are not ripe.

1624
03:25:43.249 --> 03:25:45.292
General salute!

1625
03:25:45.460 --> 03:25:50.172
Present arms!

1626
03:26:02.102 --> 03:26:03.978
Port arms!

1627
03:26:06.773 --> 03:26:08.649
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

1628
03:26:08.858 --> 03:26:11.735
The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.

1629
03:26:18.034 --> 03:26:19.827
-When?
-A day and a night, sir.

1630
03:26:20.036 --> 03:26:21.954
They've been here a day and a night.

1631
03:26:22.163 --> 03:26:24.665
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.

1632
03:26:24.958 --> 03:26:28.836
He's set up his own headquarters
in the town hall.

1633
03:26:29.754 --> 03:26:31.547
What else beside the town hall?

1634
03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:34.675
Telephone exchange,
post office, powerhouse...

1635
03:26:34.968 --> 03:26:37.344
...hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.

1636
03:26:37.554 --> 03:26:40.514
They call themselves
the Arab National Council...

1637
03:26:40.682 --> 03:26:42.349
...and they're in the town hall.

1638
03:26:42.642 --> 03:26:45.519
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.

1639
03:26:47.188 --> 03:26:48.689
What should we do about it?

1640
03:26:48.898 --> 03:26:51.316
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

1641
03:26:52.193 --> 03:26:54.028
How about that, Dryden?

1642
03:26:55.822 --> 03:26:58.532
Not unless you want
a full-scale rising.

1643
03:26:59.325 --> 03:27:02.369
-What, then?
-When will Feisal be in Damascus?

1644
03:27:02.537 --> 03:27:04.580
By special train in two days' time.

1645
03:27:04.873 --> 03:27:06.165
Two days.

1646
03:27:06.332 --> 03:27:09.710
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.

1647
03:27:10.003 --> 03:27:12.046
-Isn't it enough?
-Yes.

1648
03:27:12.213 --> 03:27:15.674
-Ample, l should think.
-We can't just do nothing.

1649
03:27:15.884 --> 03:27:19.553
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.

1650
03:27:19.804 --> 03:27:24.058
And Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.

1651
03:27:24.434 --> 03:27:26.060
Does that apply to technical units?

1652
03:27:26.352 --> 03:27:28.437
Technical units particularly.

1653
03:27:28.730 --> 03:27:30.064
Yes, sir.

1654
03:27:30.607 --> 03:27:32.066
Medicals too, sir?

1655
03:27:32.317 --> 03:27:34.526
I'm afraid so, Harry.

1656
03:27:34.861 --> 03:27:36.570
Medicals too.

1657
03:28:16.945 --> 03:28:18.487
We here...

1658
03:28:18.738 --> 03:28:21.615
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

1659
03:28:21.783 --> 03:28:24.952
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

1660
03:28:25.286 --> 03:28:28.747
...of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.

1661
03:28:28.957 --> 03:28:30.999
He insulted me.

1662
03:28:32.127 --> 03:28:36.255
Sherif Ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat...

1663
03:28:36.464 --> 03:28:39.299
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.

1664
03:28:39.801 --> 03:28:43.512
They will not work because
they are given no electricity.

1665
03:28:43.763 --> 03:28:47.307
The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.

1666
03:28:49.769 --> 03:28:52.104
If you answer,
there will be bloodshed.

1667
03:28:52.981 --> 03:28:56.483
You speak to me of bloodshed?

1668
03:28:59.195 --> 03:29:03.157
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

1669
03:29:03.408 --> 03:29:04.950
Humbly?

1670
03:29:05.118 --> 03:29:06.493
Humbly, Harith?

1671
03:29:06.786 --> 03:29:08.787
Yes, humbly.

1672
03:29:09.164 --> 03:29:11.290
This is a new trick.

1673
03:29:12.292 --> 03:29:13.959
Why is there no electricity?

1674
03:29:14.919 --> 03:29:17.671
I have been to that
electrical house, Lawrence.

1675
03:29:17.922 --> 03:29:20.799
There are three large machines.

1676
03:29:21.009 --> 03:29:23.343
He means generators!

1677
03:29:23.845 --> 03:29:25.012
So.

1678
03:29:25.471 --> 03:29:27.181
One of them is burning.

1679
03:29:27.432 --> 03:29:30.517
They are of an incredible size,
but helpless.

1680
03:29:30.852 --> 03:29:33.562
It is so of all machines.

1681
03:29:33.813 --> 03:29:37.816
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?

1682
03:29:40.486 --> 03:29:43.655
-The need is absolute.
-Then we need English engineers.

1683
03:29:43.865 --> 03:29:47.534
No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.

1684
03:29:47.827 --> 03:29:49.036
Take--

1685
03:29:53.166 --> 03:29:54.374
Fire has broken out.

1686
03:29:54.584 --> 03:29:56.168
-Where?
-The Jinsibi district.

1687
03:29:56.377 --> 03:29:59.254
-It is not a district that matters.
-It will spread!

1688
03:29:59.547 --> 03:30:01.215
Then use the fire brigade!

1689
03:30:01.507 --> 03:30:04.384
We have tried,
but there is no force in the water.

1690
03:30:04.594 --> 03:30:06.094
Then you must carry it.

1691
03:30:06.387 --> 03:30:10.724
-The Ruala do not carry water.
-What else are they good for?

1692
03:30:23.029 --> 03:30:26.573
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

1693
03:30:29.410 --> 03:30:31.119
This afternoon!

1694
03:30:54.894 --> 03:30:58.897
-I'll take this up after the war.
-Surely we should do something, sir.

1695
03:30:59.107 --> 03:31:03.068
-It's an old man's sport.
-Are you an old man, sir?

1696
03:31:03.278 --> 03:31:06.154
All I can say is, sir,
it's a heavy responsibility.

1697
03:31:07.615 --> 03:31:08.949
Sorry, sir.

1698
03:31:11.160 --> 03:31:12.828
Maybe it's the bulb.

1699
03:31:17.542 --> 03:31:18.667
No, sir.

1700
03:31:19.127 --> 03:31:20.794
It's the power.

1701
03:31:35.977 --> 03:31:37.352
They're leaving.

1702
03:31:38.062 --> 03:31:39.771
That's it, then.

1703
03:31:40.273 --> 03:31:42.357
Marvellous-looking beggars,
aren't they?

1704
03:32:03.588 --> 03:32:06.465
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

1705
03:32:06.716 --> 03:32:08.717
-Come where?
-Back.

1706
03:32:13.181 --> 03:32:15.390
I know your heart.

1707
03:32:23.858 --> 03:32:25.484
What is it?

1708
03:32:26.486 --> 03:32:28.153
Is it this?

1709
03:32:30.865 --> 03:32:33.992
I tell you, this is nothing.

1710
03:32:47.173 --> 03:32:48.840
Is it the blood?

1711
03:32:49.634 --> 03:32:52.719
The desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of.

1712
03:32:54.263 --> 03:32:58.642
I pray that I may never
see the desert again.

1713
03:32:59.727 --> 03:33:01.019
Hear me, God.

1714
03:33:02.730 --> 03:33:06.566
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.

1715
03:33:23.418 --> 03:33:24.709
What about you?

1716
03:33:25.711 --> 03:33:29.297
No, I shall stay here
and learn politics.

1717
03:33:31.801 --> 03:33:33.218
A very low occupation.

1718
03:33:33.719 --> 03:33:36.763
I had not thought of it
when I met you.

1719
03:33:45.731 --> 03:33:48.608
You have tried very hard
to give us Damascus.

1720
03:33:48.818 --> 03:33:50.735
It's what I came for.

1721
03:33:54.240 --> 03:33:55.490
And then...

1722
03:33:57.910 --> 03:33:59.286
...it would be something.

1723
03:33:59.495 --> 03:34:00.745
Yes.

1724
03:34:01.414 --> 03:34:02.622
Much.

1725
03:34:21.642 --> 03:34:24.102
-He is your friend?
-Take your hand away.

1726
03:34:24.312 --> 03:34:25.604
-You love him.
-I fear him.

1727
03:34:25.813 --> 03:34:27.647
Then why do you weep?

1728
03:34:27.982 --> 03:34:30.150
If I fear him, who love him...

1729
03:34:30.318 --> 03:34:33.278
...how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?

1730
03:34:33.654 --> 03:34:36.781
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

1731
03:34:39.160 --> 03:34:42.496
So you are not yet entirely politician.

1732
03:34:42.663 --> 03:34:43.747
Not yet.

1733
03:34:43.998 --> 03:34:48.335
Well, these are new tricks,
and I am an old dog.

1734
03:34:48.878 --> 03:34:50.795
And Allah be thanked.

1735
03:34:51.297 --> 03:34:52.672
I'll tell thee what...

1736
03:34:52.965 --> 03:34:56.301
...being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.

1737
03:35:17.782 --> 03:35:21.076
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.

1738
03:35:21.369 --> 03:35:24.204
It comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.

1739
03:35:24.413 --> 03:35:28.792
Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.

1740
03:35:29.043 --> 03:35:32.045
Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.

1741
03:35:32.338 --> 03:35:33.880
No, sir, I will not.

1742
03:35:34.840 --> 03:35:36.424
Control yourself.

1743
03:35:36.926 --> 03:35:40.053
Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.

1744
03:35:41.013 --> 03:35:43.306
We did what we could
in the civic hospitals.

1745
03:35:43.516 --> 03:35:46.351
But you forgot
the Turkish Military Hospital.

1746
03:35:46.727 --> 03:35:51.189
It has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

1747
03:35:51.857 --> 03:35:56.444
All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.

1748
03:36:03.202 --> 03:36:04.619
What's it like?

1749
03:37:21.489 --> 03:37:23.531
This is outrageous!

1750
03:37:24.659 --> 03:37:26.659
Outrageous!

1751
03:37:32.625 --> 03:37:34.834
You filthy little wog!

1752
03:37:45.346 --> 03:37:49.432
My friend Lawrence,
if I may call him that.

1753
03:37:49.684 --> 03:37:52.143
"My friend Lawrence."

1754
03:37:52.353 --> 03:37:56.981
How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.

1755
03:37:57.191 --> 03:37:59.859
He longs for the greenness
of his native land.

1756
03:38:00.069 --> 03:38:05.198
He pines for the Gothic cottages
of Surrey, is it not?

1757
03:38:05.449 --> 03:38:09.035
Already in imagination,
he catches trout...

1758
03:38:09.328 --> 03:38:12.831
...and all the activities
of the English gentleman.

1759
03:38:13.040 --> 03:38:16.543
That's me you're describing, sir,
not Colonel Lawrence.

1760
03:38:17.461 --> 03:38:19.671
You're promoted colonel.

1761
03:38:19.880 --> 03:38:22.340
Yes. What for?

1762
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:25.719
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.

1763
03:38:25.970 --> 03:38:30.056
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home.

1764
03:38:30.683 --> 03:38:32.976
Then, thank you.

1765
03:38:37.189 --> 03:38:38.398
Well, then...

1766
03:38:39.024 --> 03:38:40.066
...Godspeed.

1767
03:38:40.568 --> 03:38:44.487
There's nothing further here
for a warrior.

1768
03:38:44.739 --> 03:38:48.867
We drive bargains. Old men's work.

1769
03:38:49.076 --> 03:38:51.411
Young men make wars,
and the virtues of war...

1770
03:38:51.579 --> 03:38:53.496
...are the virtues of young men.

1771
03:38:53.748 --> 03:38:57.208
Courage and hope for the future.

1772
03:38:57.418 --> 03:39:00.086
Then old men make the peace.

1773
03:39:01.213 --> 03:39:04.090
And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.

1774
03:39:04.300 --> 03:39:06.760
Mistrust and caution.

1775
03:39:07.720 --> 03:39:09.554
It must be so.

1776
03:39:25.946 --> 03:39:30.575
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.

1777
03:39:40.294 --> 03:39:43.963
The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these I concede.

1778
03:39:44.256 --> 03:39:45.965
The pumping plant I must retain.

1779
03:39:46.175 --> 03:39:48.760
If you retain it,
there will be no water.

1780
03:39:48.969 --> 03:39:52.680
-I shall be glad of assistance.
-Then you must bring down your flag.

1781
03:39:52.973 --> 03:39:56.810
I shall not, and if your men
attempt it, my men will resist it.

1782
03:39:57.102 --> 03:39:58.770
-Have you men?
-Enough for that.

1783
03:39:58.979 --> 03:40:01.356
It's a thing that
makes an ugly incident.

1784
03:40:01.690 --> 03:40:03.566
I'm sure your government...

1785
03:40:03.818 --> 03:40:07.654
...does not wish to appear at the peace
conference as an aggressor.

1786
03:40:09.949 --> 03:40:11.449
I say!

1787
03:40:12.827 --> 03:40:14.786
It's Lawrence, isn't it?

1788
03:40:17.122 --> 03:40:19.332
May I shake your hand, sir?

1789
03:40:20.501 --> 03:40:23.127
Just want to be able
to say I'd done it, sir.

1790
03:40:26.715 --> 03:40:28.967
Haven't we met before?

1791
03:40:29.176 --> 03:40:30.802
Don't think so, sir.

1792
03:40:31.011 --> 03:40:33.721
No, no, sir, I should remember that.

1793
03:40:38.978 --> 03:40:43.147
It is widely known the Arab Council
took power in my name.

1794
03:40:43.357 --> 03:40:45.358
They have no power. lt's illusory.

1795
03:40:45.609 --> 03:40:48.027
Illusions can be very powerful.

1796
03:40:48.404 --> 03:40:50.029
Particularly...

1797
03:40:50.906 --> 03:40:53.533
...when they take this form.

1798
03:40:55.703 --> 03:40:58.705
The world is delighted
at the picture of Damascus...

1799
03:40:58.914 --> 03:41:00.874
...liberated by the Arab army.

1800
03:41:01.417 --> 03:41:04.502
Led, may I remind you,
by a British-serving officer.

1801
03:41:05.045 --> 03:41:10.049
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence
is a sword with two edges.

1802
03:41:10.342 --> 03:41:13.386
We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?

1803
03:41:17.016 --> 03:41:19.225
I thought l was a hard man, sir.

1804
03:41:20.060 --> 03:41:22.353
You are merely a general.

1805
03:41:24.899 --> 03:41:26.399
I must be a king.

1806
03:41:29.403 --> 03:41:31.279
Excuse me, sir.

1807
03:41:45.920 --> 03:41:47.211
Well?

1808
03:41:48.088 --> 03:41:49.464
Well...

1809
03:41:49.924 --> 03:41:52.800
...it seems we're to have
a British waterworks...

1810
03:41:53.052 --> 03:41:55.261
...with an Arab flag on it.

1811
03:41:55.471 --> 03:41:57.430
Do you think it was worth it?

1812
03:41:57.598 --> 03:42:00.266
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.

1813
03:42:00.601 --> 03:42:01.768
Yes, sir.

1814
03:42:02.061 --> 03:42:03.686
So you keep saying.

1815
03:42:03.896 --> 03:42:05.480
You, I suspect...

1816
03:42:05.981 --> 03:42:09.901
...are chief architect
of this compromise.

1817
03:42:10.319 --> 03:42:13.446
-What do you think?
-Me, Your Highness?

1818
03:42:14.114 --> 03:42:18.409
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

1819
03:42:56.448 --> 03:42:59.492
Well, sir. Going home.

1820
03:43:01.829 --> 03:43:03.496
Home, sir.

1821
03:43:27.696 --> 03:43:30.896
