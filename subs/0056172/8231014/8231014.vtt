1
00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:38.811
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.

2
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.147
Did you know him well?

3
00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:42.982
I knew him.

4
00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:47.070
Well, nil nisi bonum.

5
00:03:47.362 --> 00:03:49.280
But did he really deserve...

6
00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.783
...a place in here?

7
00:04:06.673 --> 00:04:09.592
Lord Allenby, could you give
a few words about Lawrence?

8
00:04:09.842 --> 00:04:11.844
What, more words?

9
00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:15.515
The revolt in the desert...

10
00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:19.394
...played a decisive part
in the Middle Eastern campaign.

11
00:04:19.686 --> 00:04:22.397
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.

12
00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:27.026
No, no. I didn't know him well,
you know.

13
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:33.241
Mr. Bentley, you know as much
about Lawrence as anybody.

14
00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.202
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

15
00:04:36.452 --> 00:04:39.080
And to make him known to the world.

16
00:04:39.372 --> 00:04:43.710
He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.

17
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.044
Thank you.

18
00:04:45.211 --> 00:04:49.924
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

19
00:04:50.341 --> 00:04:52.051
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:04:52.343 --> 00:04:54.554
My name is Jackson Bentley.

21
00:04:55.054 --> 00:04:58.933
I overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception.

22
00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:01.436
- He was a great man.
- Did you know him?

23
00:05:01.728 --> 00:05:03.730
No, I can't claim to have known him.

24
00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:06.399
I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

25
00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:08.276
Knew him? I never knew him.

26
00:05:08.568 --> 00:05:11.946
He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

27
00:05:31.758 --> 00:05:33.301
Michael George Hartley...

28
00:05:33.593 --> 00:05:36.888
...this is a nasty, dark little room.

29
00:05:37.096 --> 00:05:38.139
That's right.

30
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:40.600
We are not happy in it.

31
00:05:40.808 --> 00:05:44.687
I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark little trench.

32
00:05:44.937 --> 00:05:48.316
- Then you're a big noble fellow.
- That's right.

33
00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:53.529
Here is William Potter
with my newspaper.

34
00:05:53.946 --> 00:05:56.282
- Here you are, tosh.
- Thanks.

35
00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.454
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

36
00:06:02.997 --> 00:06:05.291
- Is it there?
- Of course.

37
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.126
Headlines.

38
00:06:07.627 --> 00:06:10.838
But I bet it isn't mentioned
in the Times.

39
00:06:11.464 --> 00:06:15.843
"Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."

40
00:06:16.803 --> 00:06:20.473
I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.

41
00:06:20.723 --> 00:06:24.435
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

42
00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.981
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes.

43
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.484
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.

44
00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:41.828
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.

45
00:06:42.078 --> 00:06:44.831
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

46
00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.958
And you're balmy!

47
00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:04.016
- It damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.

48
00:07:04.517 --> 00:07:06.102
What's the trick, then?

49
00:07:06.352 --> 00:07:10.398
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.609
By the way, if Captain Gibbon
should enquire for me...

51
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.196
...tell him I've gone
for a chat with the general.

52
00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:21.117
- He's balmy.
- He's all right.

53
00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:28.541
Lawrence.

54
00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:30.543
Yes?

55
00:07:30.793 --> 00:07:32.587
You're supposed to be...

56
00:07:33.004 --> 00:07:35.381
Do you usually wear your cap
in the mess?

57
00:07:36.257 --> 00:07:37.300
Always.

58
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.719
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?

59
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:42.388
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.

60
00:07:42.597 --> 00:07:44.557
I'm going for a powwow
with the general.

61
00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:48.269
I'm not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.

62
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:50.938
We don't want chaps in here
who should be on duty.

63
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.648
Where are you going?

64
00:07:55.568 --> 00:07:57.403
I must say, Lawrence!

65
00:07:57.612 --> 00:08:00.448
- Sorry.
- You're a clown, Lawrence.

66
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.076
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

67
00:08:06.746 --> 00:08:07.747
Sorry.

68
00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:10.583
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

69
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.045
I do not propose to let
an overweening, crass lieutenant...

70
00:08:14.253 --> 00:08:17.757
...thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.

71
00:08:18.049 --> 00:08:21.260
It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss, sir.

72
00:08:21.677 --> 00:08:24.931
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.

73
00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:26.641
There is, indeed.

74
00:08:26.933 --> 00:08:28.809
He's of no use here in Cairo.

75
00:08:29.101 --> 00:08:32.146
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

76
00:08:32.438 --> 00:08:33.940
Knows the books, you mean.

77
00:08:34.106 --> 00:08:37.276
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

78
00:08:37.443 --> 00:08:40.279
If Brighton thinks we should send
some arms, we will.

79
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.116
Well, what more do you want?

80
00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:47.453
That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...

81
00:08:47.662 --> 00:08:49.622
...giving military advice.

82
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.791
By God, I should hope not.

83
00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:56.545
It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot to...

84
00:08:56.712 --> 00:08:57.797
To what?

85
00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:00.508
To make our own appraisal
of the situation.

86
00:09:00.883 --> 00:09:04.804
I'll tell you, it's my considered
opinion and that of my staff...

87
00:09:05.096 --> 00:09:07.848
...that time spent on the Bedouin
will be time wasted.

88
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.476
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

89
00:09:10.685 --> 00:09:13.604
They did attack Medina.

90
00:09:13.813 --> 00:09:16.148
And the Turks made mincemeat
of them.

91
00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:17.733
We don't know that.

92
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:22.488
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

93
00:09:23.155 --> 00:09:27.159
In my opinion, this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow.

94
00:09:27.618 --> 00:09:30.746
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.

95
00:09:30.997 --> 00:09:33.833
Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.

96
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:36.502
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itself...

97
00:09:36.669 --> 00:09:39.338
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

98
00:09:39.547 --> 00:09:42.174
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

99
00:09:43.551 --> 00:09:46.637
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

100
00:09:46.846 --> 00:09:51.350
Does the bureau think they'll sit down
under us when this war is over?

101
00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:56.522
The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.

102
00:09:57.148 --> 00:09:59.400
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

103
00:10:00.276 --> 00:10:02.361
- Lawrence, sir.
- Send him in.

104
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.448
Good morning, sir.

105
00:10:05.698 --> 00:10:07.158
Salute.

106
00:10:09.285 --> 00:10:12.705
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.

107
00:10:12.913 --> 00:10:14.707
- It's my manner.
- Your what?

108
00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:17.793
My manner. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't.

109
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.048
I can't make out whether you're
bad-mannered or just half-witted.

110
00:10:22.381 --> 00:10:25.259
- I have the same problem, sir.
- Shut up.

111
00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:28.888
The Arab Bureau thinks you
would be of use to them in Arabia.

112
00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:30.806
Why, I can't imagine.

113
00:10:31.057 --> 00:10:33.476
You can't perform
your present duties properly.

114
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.606
"I cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city."

115
00:10:38.814 --> 00:10:41.067
- What?
- Themistocles, sir.

116
00:10:41.275 --> 00:10:44.904
- A Greek philosopher.
- I know you've been well-educated.

117
00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:47.406
It says so in your dossier.

118
00:10:49.742 --> 00:10:52.745
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.

119
00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:57.208
But I suppose I could be wrong.

120
00:10:57.792 --> 00:11:00.586
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.

121
00:11:00.753 --> 00:11:04.256
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!

122
00:11:06.258 --> 00:11:07.593
Yes, what is it?

123
00:11:07.843 --> 00:11:10.596
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

124
00:11:10.805 --> 00:11:12.807
- Is that certain?
- Yes, sir.

125
00:11:13.933 --> 00:11:16.102
There doesn't seem to be
any artillery.

126
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.105
But there must be artillery!

127
00:11:21.857 --> 00:11:25.361
Sir, this is something
of an expedition.

128
00:11:25.611 --> 00:11:29.782
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

129
00:11:30.032 --> 00:11:32.618
He can't do that in six weeks.

130
00:11:33.285 --> 00:11:35.955
- Two months, then.
- Three.

131
00:11:36.455 --> 00:11:40.543
All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

132
00:11:40.793 --> 00:11:42.461
Thank you, sir.

133
00:11:44.964 --> 00:11:48.300
I'd like to say, sir,
that I am grateful for this.

134
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:50.386
Shut up and get out.

135
00:11:56.475 --> 00:11:57.852
Sir?

136
00:12:03.482 --> 00:12:06.777
How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?

137
00:12:07.778 --> 00:12:11.657
- How did you do it?
- Might better ask why I bothered to.

138
00:12:11.907 --> 00:12:15.411
- Because I'm the man for the job.
- I just wonder about that.

139
00:12:15.661 --> 00:12:18.539
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?

140
00:12:18.831 --> 00:12:20.499
Find Prince Feisal.

141
00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:22.585
Good. And when I've found him?

142
00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:26.839
Find out what kind of a man he is.

143
00:12:27.089 --> 00:12:30.843
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.

144
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.554
That is Colonel Brighton's business,
not yours.

145
00:12:33.846 --> 00:12:38.100
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.

146
00:12:41.353 --> 00:12:42.897
That's new.

147
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.858
Where are they now?

148
00:12:46.025 --> 00:12:48.944
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.

149
00:12:49.195 --> 00:12:50.696
They're Hashemite Bedouins.

150
00:12:50.905 --> 00:12:54.575
They can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day.

151
00:12:54.867 --> 00:12:56.827
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

152
00:12:57.536 --> 00:13:01.248
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert:

153
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.044
Bedouins and gods,
and you're neither. Take it from me.

154
00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:08.547
For ordinary men,
it's a burning fiery furnace.

155
00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:12.551
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

156
00:13:16.347 --> 00:13:19.642
It is recognised that you have
a funny sense of fun.

157
00:14:35.634 --> 00:14:37.428
Here you may drink.

158
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.433
One cup.

159
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.817
You do not drink?

160
00:14:52.443 --> 00:14:53.485
No.

161
00:14:54.945 --> 00:14:56.572
I'll drink when you do.

162
00:14:57.489 --> 00:14:58.574
I am Bedu.

163
00:16:58.986 --> 00:17:03.198
Truly, now, you are a British officer?

164
00:17:03.449 --> 00:17:04.825
Yes.

165
00:17:05.576 --> 00:17:07.119
From Cairo?

166
00:17:07.578 --> 00:17:08.996
Yes.

167
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:12.791
- You did not ride from Cairo?
- No.

168
00:17:13.083 --> 00:17:16.962
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.

169
00:17:17.463 --> 00:17:19.006
And before?

170
00:17:19.631 --> 00:17:22.134
From Britain?

171
00:17:22.468 --> 00:17:23.802
Yes.

172
00:17:25.137 --> 00:17:26.513
Truly?

173
00:17:27.014 --> 00:17:28.474
From Oxfordshire.

174
00:17:30.476 --> 00:17:31.977
Is that a desert country?

175
00:17:32.978 --> 00:17:37.316
No. A fat country. Fat people.

176
00:17:38.901 --> 00:17:40.110
You are not fat?

177
00:17:40.819 --> 00:17:41.987
No.

178
00:17:43.489 --> 00:17:45.115
I'm different.

179
00:18:13.143 --> 00:18:14.520
Here...

180
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.772
...take it.

181
00:18:17.648 --> 00:18:21.068
First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.

182
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.861
Take it now.

183
00:18:41.421 --> 00:18:43.048
Bedu food.

184
00:18:58.397 --> 00:18:59.731
Good.

185
00:18:59.982 --> 00:19:01.233
More?

186
00:19:50.115 --> 00:19:52.284
- Bedu.
- Where?

187
00:20:13.263 --> 00:20:15.849
From here to Lord Feisal's camp
is Harith country.

188
00:20:16.141 --> 00:20:17.309
Yes, I know.

189
00:20:17.517 --> 00:20:19.478
- I am not Harith.
- No.

190
00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:22.314
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.

191
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.020
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.

192
00:21:02.229 --> 00:21:03.855
When you are ready to go...

193
00:21:04.064 --> 00:21:07.192
...hit her on the shoulder
and say, "Hut-hut-hut."

194
00:21:24.835 --> 00:21:28.463
Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.

195
00:21:45.564 --> 00:21:49.067
I think we reach Masturah Well
tomorrow. Yes.

196
00:21:49.234 --> 00:21:52.904
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.

197
00:21:53.113 --> 00:21:54.281
NOW!

198
00:22:54.299 --> 00:22:55.634
Good?

199
00:22:55.842 --> 00:22:57.677
It's all right.

200
00:22:58.804 --> 00:23:01.014
This is a Harith well.

201
00:23:01.473 --> 00:23:03.975
The Harith are a dirty people.

202
00:24:25.557 --> 00:24:26.933
Turks?

203
00:24:53.418 --> 00:24:54.586
Bedu.

204
00:25:41.091 --> 00:25:42.842
Who is he?

205
00:26:36.521 --> 00:26:38.148
He is dead.

206
00:26:38.523 --> 00:26:40.025
Yes.

207
00:26:41.276 --> 00:26:42.360
Why?

208
00:26:45.238 --> 00:26:46.698
This is my well.

209
00:26:48.283 --> 00:26:49.909
I have drunk from it.

210
00:26:50.869 --> 00:26:52.662
You are welcome.

211
00:26:54.372 --> 00:26:55.707
He was my friend.

212
00:26:55.915 --> 00:26:58.752
- That?
- Yes, that.

213
00:27:08.887 --> 00:27:12.098
- This pistol yours?
- No, his.

214
00:27:28.782 --> 00:27:30.075
His?

215
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.910
Mine.

216
00:27:32.577 --> 00:27:34.412
Then I will use it.

217
00:27:42.295 --> 00:27:44.589
Your friend...

218
00:27:46.591 --> 00:27:48.802
...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.

219
00:27:49.094 --> 00:27:50.470
I know.

220
00:27:58.019 --> 00:27:59.312
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.

221
00:28:01.606 --> 00:28:02.941
I have heard of you.

222
00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:06.319
So...

223
00:28:08.655 --> 00:28:10.532
...what was a Hazimi doing here?

224
00:28:10.782 --> 00:28:14.285
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.

225
00:28:14.786 --> 00:28:18.248
- You've been sent from Cairo.
- Yes.

226
00:28:18.748 --> 00:28:22.168
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.

227
00:28:23.128 --> 00:28:25.505
I can both read and write.

228
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:33.263
My Lord Feisal already
has an Englishman.

229
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.306
What is your name?

230
00:28:36.266 --> 00:28:38.852
My name is for my friends.

231
00:28:44.315 --> 00:28:46.401
None of my friends is a murderer.

232
00:28:48.319 --> 00:28:50.363
You are angry, English.

233
00:28:59.164 --> 00:29:00.999
He was nothing.

234
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:03.042
The well is everything.

235
00:29:04.085 --> 00:29:07.005
The Hazimi may not drink
at our wells.

236
00:29:07.297 --> 00:29:08.882
He knew that.

237
00:29:11.217 --> 00:29:12.427
Salaam.

238
00:29:14.012 --> 00:29:15.680
Sherif Ali.

239
00:29:16.014 --> 00:29:19.100
So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...

240
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:21.853
...so long will they be
a little people...

241
00:29:22.103 --> 00:29:23.521
...a silly people-

242
00:29:24.022 --> 00:29:28.193
Greedy, barbarous and cruel,
as you are.

243
00:29:42.332 --> 00:29:43.374
Come.

244
00:29:44.417 --> 00:29:46.044
I will take you to Feisal.

245
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:48.338
I do not want your company, sherif.

246
00:29:48.546 --> 00:29:51.883
Wadi Safra is another day from here.

247
00:29:52.217 --> 00:29:55.220
You will not find it,
and you will die.

248
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.390
I Will find it With this.

249
00:30:07.982 --> 00:30:09.984
Good army compass.

250
00:30:10.568 --> 00:30:12.487
How if I take it?

251
00:30:12.904 --> 00:30:14.239
Then you would be a thief.

252
00:30:15.406 --> 00:30:16.741
Have you no fear, English?

253
00:30:17.659 --> 00:30:20.245
My fear is my concern.

254
00:30:20.745 --> 00:30:22.080
Truly.

255
00:30:26.084 --> 00:30:28.127
God be with you, English.

256
00:32:07.393 --> 00:32:09.187
Hey, you!

257
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.708
- I've been waiting for you.
- Did you know I was coming?

258
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.211
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.

259
00:32:33.503 --> 00:32:34.879
How did he know?

260
00:32:35.088 --> 00:32:38.007
Not much happens within 50 miles
of Feisal that he doesn't know.

261
00:32:38.216 --> 00:32:40.259
I'll give him that. No escort?

262
00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:43.012
My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.

263
00:32:43.221 --> 00:32:46.099
- Turks?
- No, an Arab.

264
00:32:46.391 --> 00:32:48.810
Bloody savages.

265
00:32:50.561 --> 00:32:53.648
- This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?
- Yes, they're over there.

266
00:32:53.898 --> 00:32:56.442
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?

267
00:32:56.734 --> 00:33:00.738
Lawrence. I've been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.

268
00:33:03.408 --> 00:33:05.743
What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?

269
00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:10.915
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.

270
00:33:11.624 --> 00:33:15.545
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awful.

271
00:33:15.753 --> 00:33:18.923
Their morale, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...

272
00:33:19.132 --> 00:33:23.136
...the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.

273
00:33:23.428 --> 00:33:25.763
They're fading away by dozens
every night.

274
00:33:26.055 --> 00:33:27.640
What I want to say is this:

275
00:33:27.932 --> 00:33:30.560
Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...

276
00:33:30.768 --> 00:33:32.603
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.

277
00:33:32.812 --> 00:33:36.607
When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.

278
00:33:36.774 --> 00:33:40.778
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I understand what you're saying.

279
00:33:40.945 --> 00:33:43.865
You'll make your appreciation
and get back to--

280
00:33:46.451 --> 00:33:48.286
Oh, my God.

281
00:33:48.953 --> 00:33:50.788
Not again.

282
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.820
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.

283
00:34:23.029 --> 00:34:26.199
"Move South," I've said.
"You're still in range."

284
00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:31.662
They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!

285
00:34:58.189 --> 00:35:01.567
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

286
00:35:06.697 --> 00:35:08.157
Fire back at them.

287
00:36:20.146 --> 00:36:23.274
- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

288
00:36:23.524 --> 00:36:25.234
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

289
00:36:25.443 --> 00:36:28.738
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.

290
00:36:28.946 --> 00:36:31.324
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

291
00:36:31.616 --> 00:36:34.452
You were right and I was wrong.

292
00:36:34.744 --> 00:36:36.787
We must take some thought
for the wounded.

293
00:36:37.038 --> 00:36:40.291
- We can take care of them at Yenbo.
- If they can get to Yenbo.

294
00:36:40.499 --> 00:36:42.043
They can hardly come with us.

295
00:36:42.293 --> 00:36:46.631
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant...?

296
00:36:47.465 --> 00:36:48.674
Lawrence.

297
00:36:48.966 --> 00:36:51.344
You understand,
Lieutenant Lawrence...

298
00:36:51.552 --> 00:36:56.641
...my people are unused to
explosives and machines.

299
00:36:57.183 --> 00:37:01.145
First the guns, and now this.

300
00:37:55.741 --> 00:37:57.034
Cigarette?

301
00:37:57.243 --> 00:37:58.703
I'm sorry.

302
00:38:09.422 --> 00:38:11.382
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

303
00:38:12.258 --> 00:38:13.592
Umph off.

304
00:38:14.427 --> 00:38:17.263
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?

305
00:38:34.947 --> 00:38:36.115
Hold it, Jenkins!

306
00:38:40.453 --> 00:38:41.912
Jenkins!

307
00:38:51.297 --> 00:38:52.923
Lawrence?

308
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:56.677
You have no servant.

309
00:38:56.927 --> 00:38:59.430
- I don't need a servant.
- No?

310
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.434
We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash clothes.

311
00:39:03.642 --> 00:39:05.644
- Yes, everything.
- I don't doubt it.

312
00:39:05.936 --> 00:39:08.981
- It will be very nice for you.
- I can't afford it.

313
00:39:32.129 --> 00:39:36.509
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

314
00:39:36.801 --> 00:39:40.471
God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...

315
00:39:41.347 --> 00:39:46.727
...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

316
00:39:48.062 --> 00:39:52.316
Others do battle in his cause.

317
00:39:52.525 --> 00:39:56.862
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

318
00:39:57.488 --> 00:40:00.324
And observe the prayers.

319
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:06.956
This will be best and richest
in the recompense.

320
00:40:08.082 --> 00:40:12.002
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

321
00:40:12.753 --> 00:40:17.842
Verily, God is forgiving, merciful--

322
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.510
Greetings, Ali.

323
00:40:19.677 --> 00:40:21.512
- My lord.
- Sherif Ali.

324
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.975
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.

325
00:40:26.851 --> 00:40:28.686
Yes, my lord.

326
00:40:31.188 --> 00:40:33.482
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

327
00:40:33.691 --> 00:40:36.026
"By the noonday brightness...

328
00:40:36.235 --> 00:40:38.362
...and by the night
when it darkeneth...

329
00:40:38.612 --> 00:40:41.031
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

330
00:40:41.282 --> 00:40:43.701
...neither hath He been displeased.

331
00:40:43.993 --> 00:40:48.247
And surely the future shall be better
for thee than the past."

332
00:40:48.539 --> 00:40:52.042
"And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee...

333
00:40:52.209 --> 00:40:54.545
...and thou be satisfied."

334
00:40:56.505 --> 00:40:57.882
So?

335
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.051
Yes, colonel.

336
00:41:01.427 --> 00:41:05.139
- I want a decision, sir.
- You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

337
00:41:05.389 --> 00:41:08.058
Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.

338
00:41:08.267 --> 00:41:12.229
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

339
00:41:12.438 --> 00:41:14.398
You could supply us through Aqaba!

340
00:41:14.815 --> 00:41:16.400
Aqaba!

341
00:41:17.234 --> 00:41:19.904
If you can get ahold of Aqaba,
we can supply you.

342
00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.072
- But you can't!
- You could.

343
00:41:22.573 --> 00:41:25.159
You mean, the navy?

344
00:41:26.076 --> 00:41:29.413
The Turks have 12-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.

345
00:41:29.622 --> 00:41:31.624
Can you imagine what that means?

346
00:41:31.916 --> 00:41:33.584
Yes, I can imagine.

347
00:41:33.792 --> 00:41:38.047
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.

348
00:41:38.255 --> 00:41:40.758
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

349
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:45.179
The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.

350
00:41:45.429 --> 00:41:47.264
You can see that, sir, surely.

351
00:41:47.431 --> 00:41:50.434
I see that the canal is
an essential British interest.

352
00:41:50.601 --> 00:41:52.645
It is of little consequence to us.

353
00:41:53.145 --> 00:41:55.189
I must ask you not to speak like that.

354
00:41:55.439 --> 00:41:58.108
British and Arab interests are
one and the same.

355
00:41:59.443 --> 00:42:01.111
Possibly.

356
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.074
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.

357
00:42:05.282 --> 00:42:07.952
Fall back on Yenbo and we will
give you equipment.

358
00:42:08.118 --> 00:42:10.329
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

359
00:42:10.621 --> 00:42:13.457
- Guns?
- A modern rifle for every man.

360
00:42:13.707 --> 00:42:16.627
No. Guns. Artillery.

361
00:42:16.835 --> 00:42:20.130
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.

362
00:42:20.297 --> 00:42:23.384
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

363
00:42:23.634 --> 00:42:27.304
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

364
00:42:27.596 --> 00:42:29.223
English will teach
Bedu to fight?

365
00:42:29.473 --> 00:42:33.602
We will teach them, Sherif Ali,
to fight a modern mechanised army.

366
00:42:35.229 --> 00:42:39.358
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?

367
00:42:43.195 --> 00:42:46.031
I think it is far from Damascus.

368
00:42:46.323 --> 00:42:49.660
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.

369
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:52.871
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?

370
00:42:53.497 --> 00:42:54.873
Yes, my lord.

371
00:42:55.916 --> 00:42:57.543
It is beautiful, is it not?

372
00:42:57.835 --> 00:42:59.503
- Very.
- That will do, Lawrence.

373
00:42:59.753 --> 00:43:03.841
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
but discipline will.

374
00:43:04.133 --> 00:43:09.179
Look, Great Britain is a small
country, much smaller than yours.

375
00:43:09.388 --> 00:43:11.682
Small population compared with some.

376
00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:15.060
It's small, but it's great. And why?

377
00:43:15.352 --> 00:43:18.188
- Because it has guns.
- Because it has discipline.

378
00:43:18.397 --> 00:43:20.691
Because it has a navy,
because of this...

379
00:43:20.858 --> 00:43:22.568
...the English go
where they please...

380
00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.404
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.

381
00:43:25.696 --> 00:43:27.781
- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

382
00:43:28.032 --> 00:43:30.284
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

383
00:43:30.534 --> 00:43:32.661
But I would like to hear his opinion.

384
00:43:33.078 --> 00:43:35.289
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?

385
00:43:35.539 --> 00:43:38.959
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

386
00:43:39.209 --> 00:43:44.465
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.

387
00:43:45.591 --> 00:43:49.261
My lord, I think...

388
00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.389
I think your book is right.

389
00:43:52.723 --> 00:43:57.102
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.

390
00:43:57.394 --> 00:43:59.396
On this ocean, the Bedu go
where they please...

391
00:43:59.563 --> 00:44:01.065
...and strike where they please.

392
00:44:01.315 --> 00:44:03.567
This is the way the Bedu has
always fought.

393
00:44:03.817 --> 00:44:06.737
You're famed through the world
for fighting this way.

394
00:44:06.987 --> 00:44:09.114
And this is the way you should
fight now.

395
00:44:09.406 --> 00:44:10.949
I don't know.

396
00:44:11.241 --> 00:44:13.452
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

397
00:44:14.078 --> 00:44:18.415
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.

398
00:44:18.624 --> 00:44:20.793
- What is this to you?
- You're a traitor.

399
00:44:21.085 --> 00:44:23.087
No, colonel.

400
00:44:23.337 --> 00:44:26.590
He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.

401
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.927
They must say their say.

402
00:44:31.095 --> 00:44:36.100
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.

403
00:44:36.266 --> 00:44:38.811
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.

404
00:44:39.103 --> 00:44:41.605
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

405
00:44:43.649 --> 00:44:45.609
You tread heavily...

406
00:44:46.652 --> 00:44:49.321
...but you speak the truth.

407
00:44:50.948 --> 00:44:54.451
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

408
00:44:54.827 --> 00:44:56.620
...it is late.

409
00:45:12.344 --> 00:45:14.847
Colonel Brighton means
to put my men...

410
00:45:15.013 --> 00:45:17.891
...under European officers,
does he not?

411
00:45:18.142 --> 00:45:20.018
In effect, my lord, yes.

412
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.312
And I must do it...

413
00:45:22.896 --> 00:45:26.650
...because the Turks have
European guns.

414
00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.570
But I fear to do it...

415
00:45:30.487 --> 00:45:32.698
...upon my soul I do.

416
00:45:34.658 --> 00:45:38.829
The English have a great hunger for
desolate places.

417
00:45:39.037 --> 00:45:42.207
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

418
00:45:42.499 --> 00:45:44.376
Then you must deny it to them.

419
00:45:44.668 --> 00:45:48.213
You are an Englishman.
Are you not loyal to England?

420
00:45:48.839 --> 00:45:51.800
To England and to other things.

421
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.678
To England and Arabia both?

422
00:45:54.887 --> 00:45:56.680
And is that possible?

423
00:46:03.437 --> 00:46:07.691
I think you are another of these
desert-loving English.

424
00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.027
Doughty, Stanhope...

425
00:46:10.611 --> 00:46:12.946
...Gordon of Khartoum.

426
00:46:13.197 --> 00:46:15.449
No Arab loves the desert.

427
00:46:15.699 --> 00:46:20.704
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

428
00:46:21.747 --> 00:46:24.208
And no man needs nothing.

429
00:46:27.336 --> 00:46:30.923
Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with...

430
00:46:31.215 --> 00:46:34.760
...because we are a little people,
a silly people...

431
00:46:35.052 --> 00:46:39.223
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?

432
00:46:39.556 --> 00:46:42.851
Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...

433
00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.562
...were two miles of lighting
in the streets...

434
00:46:45.771 --> 00:46:47.481
...when London was a village.

435
00:46:47.731 --> 00:46:50.567
Yes, you were great.

436
00:46:50.776 --> 00:46:52.903
Nine centuries ago.

437
00:46:53.153 --> 00:46:55.364
Time to be great again, my lord.

438
00:46:55.572 --> 00:46:58.867
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.

439
00:46:59.076 --> 00:47:02.871
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the English.

440
00:47:04.081 --> 00:47:06.375
But my father is old...

441
00:47:07.376 --> 00:47:09.086
...and I...

442
00:47:10.754 --> 00:47:14.466
...I long for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.

443
00:47:16.301 --> 00:47:19.263
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

444
00:47:20.597 --> 00:47:24.476
To be great again, it seems that we
need the English...

445
00:47:24.768 --> 00:47:25.769
---C)I"--.-...

446
00:47:26.019 --> 00:47:27.437
Gr?

447
00:47:27.938 --> 00:47:31.608
What no man can provide,
Mr. Lawrence.

448
00:47:31.817 --> 00:47:34.278
We need a miracle.

449
00:50:39.588 --> 00:50:40.630
Aqaba.

450
00:50:44.134 --> 00:50:45.510
Aqaba.

451
00:50:46.344 --> 00:50:47.971
From the land.

452
00:50:48.972 --> 00:50:50.724
You are mad.

453
00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:55.520
To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nefud Desert.

454
00:50:55.729 --> 00:50:56.980
That's right.

455
00:50:57.314 --> 00:50:59.483
The Nefud cannot be crossed.

456
00:50:59.691 --> 00:51:01.610
I'll cross it if you will.

457
00:51:01.818 --> 00:51:05.989
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.

458
00:51:06.198 --> 00:51:08.992
The Nefud is the worst place
God created.

459
00:51:09.242 --> 00:51:13.246
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.

460
00:51:13.663 --> 00:51:15.165
Fifty men?

461
00:51:15.415 --> 00:51:18.001
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

462
00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:20.629
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...

463
00:51:20.837 --> 00:51:23.882
...they would be 50 men
other men might join.

464
00:51:24.674 --> 00:51:27.010
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

465
00:51:27.344 --> 00:51:30.347
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.

466
00:51:30.639 --> 00:51:32.849
- Good fighters, though.
- Good--

467
00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:37.229
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

468
00:51:37.521 --> 00:51:41.650
They face the sea, Shem A“,
and cannot be turned around.

469
00:51:41.858 --> 00:51:45.570
From the landward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.

470
00:51:45.862 --> 00:51:50.867
With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.

471
00:51:51.076 --> 00:51:53.703
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.

472
00:51:57.165 --> 00:51:59.167
Aqaba's over there.

473
00:52:01.711 --> 00:52:03.922
It's only a matter of going.

474
00:52:05.048 --> 00:52:07.384
You are mad.

475
00:52:14.558 --> 00:52:17.060
And where are you going, lieutenant?

476
00:52:18.395 --> 00:52:20.438
With 50 of my men.

477
00:52:22.065 --> 00:52:23.275
To work your miracle.

478
00:52:23.608 --> 00:52:27.904
Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.

479
00:52:28.613 --> 00:52:31.241
- Who told you?
- Ali did.

480
00:52:31.408 --> 00:52:33.118
Why not you?

481
00:52:34.744 --> 00:52:37.747
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?

482
00:52:37.998 --> 00:52:40.250
Yes, I must.

483
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.587
But I will spare these to you.

484
00:52:45.463 --> 00:52:48.592
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

485
00:52:49.217 --> 00:52:53.138
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance,
my lord.

486
00:52:54.097 --> 00:52:56.600
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.

487
00:52:56.808 --> 00:52:57.851
No.

488
00:53:09.738 --> 00:53:11.740
Since you do know...

489
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:15.785
...we can claim to arrive
in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

490
00:53:16.161 --> 00:53:19.456
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.

491
00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:23.376
But in whose name do you ride?

492
00:55:51.941 --> 00:55:54.611
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

493
00:55:54.903 --> 00:55:57.113
They were here. I caught them.

494
00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.200
Why are you here? Boy!

495
00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:02.327
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

496
00:56:02.619 --> 00:56:05.205
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.

497
00:56:05.455 --> 00:56:07.290
You have been tracking us.

498
00:56:07.957 --> 00:56:10.210
- You were told to stay.
- No, sherif.

499
00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.504
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

500
00:56:12.796 --> 00:56:15.673
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.

501
00:56:15.965 --> 00:56:18.551
- It is the will of Allah.
- Blasphemy.

502
00:56:18.802 --> 00:56:20.053
Don't do that.

503
00:56:20.512 --> 00:56:25.225
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.

504
00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:28.561
Be warned. They are not suitable.

505
00:56:28.812 --> 00:56:32.565
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.

506
00:56:34.192 --> 00:56:37.654
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

507
00:56:41.658 --> 00:56:44.494
One shilling, every week?

508
00:56:44.702 --> 00:56:46.329
That is fair.

509
00:56:46.996 --> 00:56:48.331
- Each?
- No.

510
00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:50.166
- That is too much.
- All right.

511
00:56:58.758 --> 00:57:02.971
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.

512
00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.611
There is the railway.

513
00:57:19.487 --> 00:57:22.407
And that is the desert.

514
00:57:23.867 --> 00:57:27.579
From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.

515
00:57:27.787 --> 00:57:31.082
For the camels, no water at all.

516
00:57:31.708 --> 00:57:33.877
If the camels die...

517
00:57:35.211 --> 00:57:36.546
...we die.

518
00:57:37.505 --> 00:57:40.300
And in 20 days they will start to die.

519
00:57:45.805 --> 00:57:49.058
There's no time to waste, then,
is there?

520
01:00:21.169 --> 01:00:22.879
I was thinking.

521
01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:24.797
You were drifting.

522
01:00:26.758 --> 01:00:30.428
Yes. It will not happen again.

523
01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.390
Be warned, you were drifting.

524
01:00:35.058 --> 01:00:37.101
It will not happen again.

525
01:01:39.247 --> 01:01:41.124
That water is wasted.

526
01:01:46.546 --> 01:01:48.840
From now on,
we must travel by night...

527
01:01:49.132 --> 01:01:52.009
...and rest while it is
too hot to travel.

528
01:01:52.301 --> 01:01:54.679
A few hours each day.

529
01:01:56.514 --> 01:01:58.474
Why don't we start now?

530
01:01:58.641 --> 01:02:01.352
No. We will rest now.

531
01:02:03.187 --> 01:02:04.313
Three hours.

532
01:02:04.564 --> 01:02:05.982
Fine.

533
01:02:06.566 --> 01:02:08.025
I'll wake you.

534
01:04:26.539 --> 01:04:28.124
Do we rest here?

535
01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:31.502
There is no rest now short of water.

536
01:04:31.794 --> 01:04:33.796
The other side of that.

537
01:04:34.964 --> 01:04:37.133
And how much of that is there?

538
01:04:37.466 --> 01:04:39.010
I'm not sure.

539
01:04:40.136 --> 01:04:44.473
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.

540
01:04:45.558 --> 01:04:47.810
This is the sun's anvil.

541
01:06:20.403 --> 01:06:21.654
Have we done it?

542
01:06:21.904 --> 01:06:25.032
No, but we're off the anvil.

543
01:06:25.908 --> 01:06:27.451
Thank God for that anyway.

544
01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.578
Yes, thank him.

545
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:33.416
Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted him.

546
01:06:33.666 --> 01:06:34.959
I know.

547
01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:39.797
We've done it.

548
01:06:40.089 --> 01:06:41.632
God willing.

549
01:06:43.759 --> 01:06:45.803
When do we reach the wells?

550
01:06:46.178 --> 01:06:49.348
God willing, midday.

551
01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:53.269
- Then we've done it.
- Thank him, Lawrence. Thank him.

552
01:06:56.939 --> 01:06:58.566
Gasim's.

553
01:07:02.445 --> 01:07:04.155
What's happened to him?

554
01:07:04.947 --> 01:07:06.449
God knows.

555
01:07:08.117 --> 01:07:09.994
Why don't you stop?

556
01:07:10.453 --> 01:07:13.956
For what? He will be dead by midday.

557
01:07:19.295 --> 01:07:21.088
We must go back.

558
01:07:21.297 --> 01:07:24.175
What for, to die with Gasim?

559
01:07:25.468 --> 01:07:27.720
In one hour comes the sun.

560
01:07:29.221 --> 01:07:33.893
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

561
01:07:34.143 --> 01:07:35.478
I can.

562
01:07:36.312 --> 01:07:37.980
Take the boys.

563
01:07:43.819 --> 01:07:46.322
If you go back, you kill yourself,
is all.

564
01:07:46.489 --> 01:07:48.824
Gasim you have killed already.

565
01:07:49.325 --> 01:07:50.659
Get out of my way.

566
01:07:50.993 --> 01:07:54.830
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.

567
01:07:55.039 --> 01:07:56.373
Nothing is written!

568
01:07:59.502 --> 01:08:00.920
Go back, then!

569
01:08:01.337 --> 01:08:04.673
What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?

570
01:08:05.674 --> 01:08:07.551
English blasphemer!

571
01:08:08.677 --> 01:08:10.262
Aqaba?

572
01:08:10.763 --> 01:08:12.556
Was it Aqaba?

573
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:16.143
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

574
01:08:18.187 --> 01:08:19.772
Go back, blasphemer...

575
01:08:20.356 --> 01:08:22.358
...but you will not be at Aqaba.

576
01:08:22.733 --> 01:08:24.443
I shall be at Aqaba.

577
01:08:24.693 --> 01:08:26.737
That is written.

578
01:08:27.363 --> 01:08:28.656
In here.

579
01:08:38.541 --> 01:08:40.292
English!

580
01:08:40.543 --> 01:08:42.211
English!

581
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:18.190
Lawrence! Daud!

582
01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:28.737
Nothing is written.

583
01:18:00.936 --> 01:18:02.521
AI Lawrence.

584
01:18:06.942 --> 01:18:08.360
Farraj.

585
01:18:09.486 --> 01:18:10.654
Wash.

586
01:18:47.858 --> 01:18:49.568
AI Lawrence.

587
01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:54.656
Truly, for some men nothing is written
unless they write it.

588
01:18:59.327 --> 01:19:02.330
Not AI Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

589
01:19:02.539 --> 01:19:05.292
- AI Lawrence is better.
- True.

590
01:19:07.294 --> 01:19:09.880
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

591
01:19:16.219 --> 01:19:19.014
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

592
01:19:19.222 --> 01:19:22.017
- Is that a lord?
- A kind of lord.

593
01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:25.103
Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.

594
01:19:25.353 --> 01:19:26.563
No.

595
01:19:28.732 --> 01:19:30.525
You have an elder brother.

596
01:19:30.692 --> 01:19:31.902
No.

597
01:19:32.068 --> 01:19:37.199
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.

598
01:19:38.742 --> 01:19:40.702
He didn't marry my mother.

599
01:19:42.204 --> 01:19:43.872
I see.

600
01:19:44.372 --> 01:19:45.749
I'm sorry.

601
01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:51.630
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

602
01:19:54.216 --> 01:19:56.718
Yes, I suppose I am.

603
01:19:58.053 --> 01:19:59.763
AI Lawrence is best.

604
01:20:02.724 --> 01:20:06.853
All right, I'll settle for
AI Lawrence.

605
01:20:36.508 --> 01:20:39.594
They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.

606
01:20:52.274 --> 01:20:53.942
Very fine.

607
01:20:55.944 --> 01:21:00.031
- Great honour.
- The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

608
01:21:00.282 --> 01:21:02.701
- Is it permitted?
- Surely.

609
01:21:07.914 --> 01:21:12.961
He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan.

610
01:21:20.969 --> 01:21:24.222
They are good for riding. Try.

611
01:23:16.334 --> 01:23:18.044
What are you doing, Englishman?

612
01:23:19.421 --> 01:23:20.964
As you see.

613
01:23:22.257 --> 01:23:23.299
Are you alone?

614
01:23:23.758 --> 01:23:25.343
Almost.

615
01:23:33.977 --> 01:23:36.438
Are you with those dogs
drinking at my well?

616
01:23:36.688 --> 01:23:38.106
Yours?

617
01:23:41.693 --> 01:23:43.486
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

618
01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:48.116
I've heard of another man
of that name.

619
01:23:48.992 --> 01:23:50.702
Other? What other?

620
01:23:51.077 --> 01:23:55.290
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.

621
01:23:58.793 --> 01:24:00.962
He must be a great hero.

622
01:24:01.171 --> 01:24:02.881
He is.

623
01:24:03.131 --> 01:24:06.301
He wouldn't refuse water to men
coming out of Nefud Desert.

624
01:24:06.634 --> 01:24:08.720
Now, would he not?

625
01:24:11.306 --> 01:24:14.142
No, that must be some other man.

626
01:24:16.644 --> 01:24:18.521
Here is my help.

627
01:24:44.214 --> 01:24:46.883
Son, what fashion is this?

628
01:24:48.218 --> 01:24:51.888
- Harith, Father.
- What manner of Harith?

629
01:24:52.514 --> 01:24:53.848
A Beni Wejh sherif.

630
01:24:54.849 --> 01:24:56.351
And is he Harith?

631
01:24:56.559 --> 01:24:58.770
No, Father, English.

632
01:25:02.023 --> 01:25:03.358
Son...

633
01:25:04.192 --> 01:25:06.277
...they are stealing our water.

634
01:25:07.195 --> 01:25:09.030
Tell them we are coming.

635
01:25:09.781 --> 01:25:10.865
Tell them.

636
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:22.478
- Empty that!
- Do not!

637
01:26:24.772 --> 01:26:26.941
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

638
01:26:27.734 --> 01:26:29.777
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.

639
01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.253
Harith.

640
01:26:48.129 --> 01:26:49.297
Ali.

641
01:26:50.006 --> 01:26:52.258
Does your father still steal?

642
01:26:54.344 --> 01:26:55.553
No.

643
01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:00.141
Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?

644
01:27:01.351 --> 01:27:04.520
No. There is no resemblance.

645
01:27:05.396 --> 01:27:07.815
Alas, you resemble your father.

646
01:27:08.274 --> 01:27:11.152
- Auda flatters me.
- You are easily flattered.

647
01:27:11.694 --> 01:27:14.155
I knew your father well.

648
01:27:14.572 --> 01:27:16.407
Did you know your own?

649
01:27:19.786 --> 01:27:24.499
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?

650
01:27:24.999 --> 01:27:28.086
Why, then you have a blood feud
with the Howeitat.

651
01:27:29.379 --> 01:27:32.423
- Do you desire it?
- Not the generals in Cairo...

652
01:27:32.924 --> 01:27:36.010
...nor the sultan himself desire that.

653
01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:40.348
Call off your men.

654
01:27:45.895 --> 01:27:48.523
This honours the unworthy.

655
01:27:48.856 --> 01:27:50.942
I've only just begun to teach him.

656
01:27:51.192 --> 01:27:55.446
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?

657
01:27:55.697 --> 01:27:57.699
Be not clever with me, English.

658
01:27:59.409 --> 01:28:02.704
- Who is he?
- A friend of Prince Feisal's.

659
01:28:12.213 --> 01:28:15.383
- So you desire my hospitality?
- Yes.

660
01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:17.093
Is he your tongue?

661
01:28:17.844 --> 01:28:19.595
We do desire it.

662
01:28:22.765 --> 01:28:25.893
Then it is given, if you will take it.

663
01:28:27.395 --> 01:28:29.230
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

664
01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:34.235
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.

665
01:28:34.986 --> 01:28:39.407
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the
Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.

666
01:28:40.658 --> 01:28:41.909
But...

667
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:43.745
...dine with me.

668
01:28:45.121 --> 01:28:46.581
Dine with Auda, English.

669
01:28:47.415 --> 01:28:49.917
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

670
01:28:50.668 --> 01:28:55.423
It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

671
01:31:35.082 --> 01:31:38.753
This thing you work against Aqaba...

672
01:31:39.128 --> 01:31:41.547
...what profit do you hope from it?

673
01:31:41.756 --> 01:31:44.342
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

674
01:31:44.592 --> 01:31:46.677
The Harith do not work for profit.

675
01:31:47.845 --> 01:31:51.599
Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali...

676
01:31:52.099 --> 01:31:54.602
...he could find worse masters
than Feisal.

677
01:31:54.936 --> 01:31:57.772
But l...
I cannot serve.

678
01:31:58.648 --> 01:32:01.692
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

679
01:32:01.943 --> 01:32:03.945
Yes, it is my pleasure.

680
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:12.453
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

681
01:32:12.954 --> 01:32:13.955
No?

682
01:32:14.997 --> 01:32:17.667
- For the English, then?
- For the Arabs.

683
01:32:18.292 --> 01:32:19.710
The Arabs?

684
01:32:20.503 --> 01:32:24.799
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

685
01:32:25.007 --> 01:32:27.009
I have even heard of the Harith.

686
01:32:27.677 --> 01:32:29.178
But the Arabs?

687
01:32:29.637 --> 01:32:31.806
What tribe is that?

688
01:32:33.474 --> 01:32:37.645
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.

689
01:32:37.853 --> 01:32:39.897
Well, they are nothing to me.

690
01:32:40.147 --> 01:32:42.024
My tribe is the Howeitat.

691
01:32:42.233 --> 01:32:44.610
Who work only for profit.

692
01:32:44.819 --> 01:32:46.487
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

693
01:32:46.654 --> 01:32:49.323
And Auda's pleasure is
to serve the Turks.

694
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:50.658
Serve?

695
01:32:51.117 --> 01:32:52.159
I serve?

696
01:32:52.368 --> 01:32:55.037
It is the servant who takes money.

697
01:33:00.334 --> 01:33:02.044
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

698
01:33:02.336 --> 01:33:04.171
- Does Auda serve?
- No!

699
01:33:04.338 --> 01:33:07.508
- Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
- No!

700
01:33:12.179 --> 01:33:16.267
I carry 23 great wounds,
all got in battle.

701
01:33:16.726 --> 01:33:20.229
75 men have I killed with
my own hands, in battle.

702
01:33:20.438 --> 01:33:24.650
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.

703
01:33:24.859 --> 01:33:28.946
The Turks pay me a golden treasure,
yet I am poor!

704
01:33:29.196 --> 01:33:33.367
Because I am a river to my people.

705
01:33:42.043 --> 01:33:43.210
Is that service?

706
01:33:43.753 --> 01:33:45.046
No.

707
01:33:51.761 --> 01:33:55.264
And yet now it seems Auda
has grown old.

708
01:33:55.473 --> 01:33:58.225
And lost his taste for fighting.

709
01:33:58.392 --> 01:34:02.563
It is well you say it in my tent,
thou old tulip.

710
01:34:02.772 --> 01:34:06.567
Yet this is a tulip
that the Turks could not buy.

711
01:34:06.734 --> 01:34:08.569
Why should they wish to?

712
01:34:10.738 --> 01:34:11.781
Now...

713
01:34:12.406 --> 01:34:16.577
I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is...

714
01:34:16.786 --> 01:34:19.080
...a servant's wages.

715
01:34:19.246 --> 01:34:23.250
They pay me, month by month...

716
01:34:23.459 --> 01:34:27.588
...100 golden guineas.

717
01:34:28.756 --> 01:34:31.926
150, Auda.

718
01:34:32.134 --> 01:34:35.096
- Who told you that?
- I have long ears.

719
01:34:35.262 --> 01:34:37.598
And a long tongue between them.

720
01:34:37.765 --> 01:34:41.143
100, 150, what matters?
It's a trifle.

721
01:34:41.352 --> 01:34:45.147
A trifle which they take
from a great box they have.

722
01:34:45.356 --> 01:34:47.358
In Aqaba.

723
01:34:48.609 --> 01:34:51.320
- In Aqaba?
- Where else?

724
01:34:52.238 --> 01:34:55.116
You trouble me like women.

725
01:34:55.449 --> 01:34:58.619
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda will not come to Aqaba.

726
01:34:59.286 --> 01:35:00.454
- For money?
- No.

727
01:35:00.788 --> 01:35:01.956
- For Feisal?
- No!

728
01:35:02.164 --> 01:35:05.251
Nor to drive away the Turks.

729
01:35:06.001 --> 01:35:07.878
He will come...

730
01:35:08.796 --> 01:35:11.132
...because it is his pleasure.

731
01:35:13.134 --> 01:35:16.804
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

732
01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:21.642
Make God your agent!

733
01:35:22.977 --> 01:35:25.146
Aqaba!

734
01:35:25.354 --> 01:35:27.022
Aqaba!

735
01:35:42.705 --> 01:35:44.707
God be with you.

736
01:35:47.668 --> 01:35:49.336
God be with you.

737
01:36:02.850 --> 01:36:05.352
God be with you.

738
01:36:05.811 --> 01:36:07.855
God be with you.

739
01:39:03.405 --> 01:39:04.865
Yes.

740
01:39:05.199 --> 01:39:06.241
Aqaba.

741
01:39:07.868 --> 01:39:10.537
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

742
01:39:11.747 --> 01:39:14.708
- Do you think we shall?
- Yes.

743
01:39:14.875 --> 01:39:17.628
If you are right about the guns.

744
01:39:45.572 --> 01:39:48.283
He killed. He dies.

745
01:39:49.034 --> 01:39:51.245
This is the end of Aqaba.

746
01:39:53.914 --> 01:39:55.749
One of our men
murdered Auda's man.

747
01:39:55.916 --> 01:39:56.917
Why?

748
01:39:57.126 --> 01:40:00.170
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.

749
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:01.839
Ali!

750
01:40:02.256 --> 01:40:04.091
It is an ancient wound.

751
01:40:04.299 --> 01:40:07.261
I didn't come here to watch
a tribal bloodbath.

752
01:40:11.765 --> 01:40:13.934
It is the law, Lawrence.

753
01:40:14.101 --> 01:40:16.437
The law says the man must die.

754
01:40:17.354 --> 01:40:20.441
If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?

755
01:40:21.442 --> 01:40:22.693
Yes.

756
01:40:26.155 --> 01:40:27.781
Sherif Ali!

757
01:40:27.948 --> 01:40:30.951
If none of Lord Auda's men harms
any of yours...

758
01:40:31.326 --> 01:40:34.580
-...will that content the Harith?
- Yes.

759
01:40:40.711 --> 01:40:43.338
Then I will execute the law.

760
01:40:44.339 --> 01:40:46.467
I have no tribe.

761
01:40:47.718 --> 01:40:50.012
And no one is offended.

762
01:41:02.483 --> 01:41:03.484
Gasim.

763
01:41:07.988 --> 01:41:09.406
Did you do it?

764
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:38.018
Well, Lawrence...

765
01:41:45.526 --> 01:41:46.902
What ails the Englishman?

766
01:41:47.152 --> 01:41:50.572
That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nefud.

767
01:41:50.781 --> 01:41:52.783
It was written, then.

768
01:41:53.659 --> 01:41:55.661
Better to have left him.

769
01:41:59.289 --> 01:42:02.584
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.

770
01:42:03.043 --> 01:42:05.295
Besides, it was necessary.

771
01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:08.590
You gave life and you took it.

772
01:42:09.174 --> 01:42:10.717
The writing is still yours.

773
01:42:47.921 --> 01:42:50.007
Auda Abu Tayi!

774
01:46:06.036 --> 01:46:08.288
The miracle is accomplished.

775
01:46:09.289 --> 01:46:10.916
Garlands for the conqueror.

776
01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:35.190
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.

777
01:46:35.982 --> 01:46:37.692
I'm none of those things, Ali.

778
01:46:37.943 --> 01:46:40.570
- What, then?
- Don't know.

779
01:46:41.655 --> 01:46:42.948
Thanks.

780
01:46:44.491 --> 01:46:46.660
My God, I love this country.

781
01:46:48.328 --> 01:46:49.329
What!

782
01:46:50.372 --> 01:46:52.249
No gold in Aqaba!

783
01:46:53.583 --> 01:46:56.002
Auda, I found it!

784
01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:06.847
That's a pity.

785
01:47:10.392 --> 01:47:12.978
Ali, get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.

786
01:47:13.186 --> 01:47:15.689
Tell Feisal to find boats,
any boats...

787
01:47:15.856 --> 01:47:19.025
...and bring the Arab army here
to Aqaba, quickly.

788
01:47:19.234 --> 01:47:20.402
And you?

789
01:47:21.194 --> 01:47:23.738
I'm going to tell the generals...

790
01:47:24.197 --> 01:47:26.032
...in Cairo.

791
01:47:26.241 --> 01:47:28.577
Yes, cross Sinai.

792
01:47:28.869 --> 01:47:29.870
Come on!

793
01:47:30.203 --> 01:47:31.538
Sinai?

794
01:47:32.038 --> 01:47:33.373
Yes.

795
01:47:33.874 --> 01:47:37.544
- With these?
- They'll be all right with me.

796
01:47:42.799 --> 01:47:46.928
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:

797
01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:50.056
"We've taken Aqaba,"
the generals would laugh.

798
01:47:50.807 --> 01:47:52.100
I see.

799
01:47:52.726 --> 01:47:55.896
In Cairo you will put off
these funny clothes.

800
01:47:56.062 --> 01:48:00.275
You'll wear trousers and tell stories
of our quaintness and barbarity...

801
01:48:00.901 --> 01:48:03.153
...and then they will believe you.

802
01:48:03.737 --> 01:48:05.906
You're an ignorant man.

803
01:48:25.926 --> 01:48:27.344
Paper.

804
01:48:28.261 --> 01:48:30.096
Papefl

805
01:48:32.807 --> 01:48:35.477
There is no gold in Aqaba.

806
01:48:36.603 --> 01:48:38.438
No gold.

807
01:48:39.814 --> 01:48:41.775
No great box!

808
01:48:45.946 --> 01:48:48.281
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?

809
01:48:48.823 --> 01:48:51.117
For my pleasure, as you said.

810
01:48:52.369 --> 01:48:54.871
But gold is honourable...

811
01:48:55.956 --> 01:48:58.625
...and Lawrence promised gold.

812
01:48:59.709 --> 01:49:00.877
Lawrence lied.

813
01:49:02.837 --> 01:49:04.297
See, Auda.

814
01:49:06.967 --> 01:49:09.094
"The Crown of England...

815
01:49:10.178 --> 01:49:12.639
...promises to pay...

816
01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:18.019
...5000 golden guineas...

817
01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:23.233
...to Auda Abu Tayi."

818
01:49:24.359 --> 01:49:28.655
Signed in His Majesty's absence...

819
01:49:28.905 --> 01:49:30.323
"Dy..-

820
01:49:32.033 --> 01:49:33.243
...me.

821
01:49:34.327 --> 01:49:36.496
In 10 days...

822
01:49:37.205 --> 01:49:39.332
...I'll be back with the gold.

823
01:49:40.417 --> 01:49:45.171
With gold, with guns, with everything.

824
01:49:46.256 --> 01:49:47.841
Ten days.

825
01:49:49.134 --> 01:49:50.760
You'll cross Sinai?

826
01:49:51.052 --> 01:49:52.429
Why not?

827
01:49:53.179 --> 01:49:54.889
Moses did.

828
01:49:57.517 --> 01:49:59.728
And you will take the children?

829
01:50:01.021 --> 01:50:02.397
Moses did.

830
01:50:02.647 --> 01:50:04.357
Moses was a prophet...

831
01:50:04.858 --> 01:50:07.444
...and beloved of God.

832
01:50:12.741 --> 01:50:16.870
He said there was gold here.
He lied.

833
01:50:18.163 --> 01:50:21.041
He is not perfect.

834
01:50:31.092 --> 01:50:33.553
Lord, can we not rest?

835
01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:36.890
I told you, no rest till
they know that I have Aqaba.

836
01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:40.810
Have you two slept in beds?

837
01:50:41.061 --> 01:50:42.270
F array?

838
01:50:42.896 --> 01:50:44.189
Daud?

839
01:50:45.398 --> 01:50:47.067
With sheets?

840
01:50:48.985 --> 01:50:52.447
Tomorrow the finest sheets
in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.

841
01:50:52.697 --> 01:50:53.990
I promise.

842
01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:56.910
Then it shall be so, lord.

843
01:51:18.264 --> 01:51:19.599
Look!

844
01:51:26.356 --> 01:51:27.941
Pillar of fire.

845
01:51:31.152 --> 01:51:33.154
No, lord. Dust.

846
01:52:22.787 --> 01:52:24.289
My compass.

847
01:52:26.082 --> 01:52:27.375
No matter.

848
01:52:27.834 --> 01:52:31.546
If we ride west,
we must strike the canal.

849
01:52:32.672 --> 01:52:34.048
Due west.

850
01:52:54.694 --> 01:52:56.196
Come on!

851
01:53:29.604 --> 01:53:32.232
Lawrence!

852
01:53:44.953 --> 01:53:46.246
F array!

853
01:53:56.506 --> 01:53:59.425
Farraj, don't! Don't!

854
01:54:00.468 --> 01:54:01.886
Don't!

855
01:55:37.357 --> 01:55:38.524
Why do you walk?

856
01:55:41.277 --> 01:55:43.196
But why, lord?

857
01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:55.792
But why, lord?

858
01:55:56.042 --> 01:55:59.504
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.

859
01:56:25.238 --> 01:56:27.740
Lawrence, look!

860
01:57:36.642 --> 01:57:38.686
It's all right, Farraj.

861
01:57:38.895 --> 01:57:40.480
It's all right.

862
01:58:52.385 --> 01:58:54.262
Who are you?

863
01:58:56.389 --> 01:58:59.058
Who are you?

864
01:59:34.468 --> 01:59:37.096
- Daud!
- We're here, sir.

865
01:59:55.281 --> 01:59:56.824
You taking him in there?

866
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:59.327
Yes.

867
02:00:19.847 --> 02:00:21.265
Here!

868
02:00:23.184 --> 02:00:25.519
Here. You!

869
02:00:27.063 --> 02:00:30.566
And where the hell do you think
you're going to, Mustapha?

870
02:00:31.317 --> 02:00:32.818
We are thirsty.

871
02:00:34.654 --> 02:00:37.073
- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.

872
02:00:37.531 --> 02:00:40.660
- Are you going to the officers' bar?
- Yes.

873
02:00:41.869 --> 02:00:44.163
You can't take him in there, sir.

874
02:00:47.833 --> 02:00:50.378
What do you think you look like?

875
02:01:09.063 --> 02:01:10.690
No, no. You must go.

876
02:01:10.898 --> 02:01:12.525
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

877
02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:17.113
Get out! You must get out! Get out!

878
02:01:18.739 --> 02:01:23.035
We want two large glasses
of lemonade.

879
02:01:23.244 --> 02:01:27.081
- This is a bar for British officers.
- We are not particular.

880
02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:36.340
- Are you off your head?
- No. Oddly enough I'm not.

881
02:01:36.590 --> 02:01:40.219
- Just clear out of here, will you?
- Get that boy out of here.

882
02:01:40.553 --> 02:01:43.222
Corporal, we'll have
this one out anyway.

883
02:01:43.889 --> 02:01:46.434
- Get that wog out of here.
- Clear off.

884
02:01:48.561 --> 02:01:50.271
What's going on?

885
02:01:53.232 --> 02:01:57.153
- It's Lawrence, sir.
- Lemonade with ice.

886
02:01:58.487 --> 02:02:00.072
Explain yourself.

887
02:02:00.781 --> 02:02:02.575
We've taken Aqaba.

888
02:02:03.075 --> 02:02:05.745
- Taken Aqaba? Who has?
- We have.

889
02:02:05.995 --> 02:02:10.499
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.

890
02:02:11.250 --> 02:02:12.585
We have.

891
02:02:14.378 --> 02:02:16.255
He likes your lemonade.

892
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:18.507
You mean the Turks have gone?

893
02:02:18.799 --> 02:02:21.761
No, they're still there
but they've no boots.

894
02:02:22.261 --> 02:02:26.390
Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners. The entire garrison.

895
02:02:26.891 --> 02:02:29.101
That's not true. We killed some.

896
02:02:29.310 --> 02:02:33.272
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.

897
02:02:34.607 --> 02:02:37.485
There's been a lot of killing
one way or another.

898
02:02:39.612 --> 02:02:43.115
Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.

899
02:02:43.324 --> 02:02:46.118
- It isn't possible.
- Yes, it is.

900
02:02:46.452 --> 02:02:48.287
I did it.

901
02:02:53.501 --> 02:02:55.169
You'd better talk to Allenby.

902
02:02:55.461 --> 02:02:58.214
- General Allenby?
- He's in command. Murray's gone.

903
02:02:58.464 --> 02:03:00.716
That's a step in the right direction.

904
02:03:01.467 --> 02:03:04.220
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.

905
02:03:04.512 --> 02:03:07.223
- Yes, of course.
- It's for him.

906
02:03:08.974 --> 02:03:11.852
Right. You want a bed yourself,
don't you?

907
02:03:12.144 --> 02:03:14.146
See Allenby first, though.

908
02:03:14.814 --> 02:03:16.440
Will he see me?

909
02:03:17.191 --> 02:03:18.692
I think so.

910
02:03:19.443 --> 02:03:20.986
Do that, then.

911
02:03:25.866 --> 02:03:28.494
- I'd better shave.
- Yes, you had.

912
02:03:28.702 --> 02:03:31.330
You'd better get into
some trousers too.

913
02:03:42.508 --> 02:03:44.343
"Undisciplined.

914
02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:48.180
Unpunctual.

915
02:03:49.348 --> 02:03:51.267
Untidy.

916
02:03:53.102 --> 02:03:55.229
Several languages.

917
02:03:56.522 --> 02:03:58.524
Knowledge of music...

918
02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:01.193
...literature.

919
02:04:02.236 --> 02:04:04.196
Knowledge of...

920
02:04:05.573 --> 02:04:07.366
Knowledge of..."

921
02:04:10.578 --> 02:04:13.539
You're an interesting man,
there's no doubt about it.

922
02:04:14.206 --> 02:04:17.293
- Who told you to take Aqaba?
- Nobody.

923
02:04:17.585 --> 02:04:20.254
- Sir.
- Sir.

924
02:04:20.546 --> 02:04:21.881
Then why did you?

925
02:04:22.047 --> 02:04:24.550
- Aqaba's important.
- Why is it important?

926
02:04:24.758 --> 02:04:27.303
- It's the Turkish route to the canal.
- Not anymore.

927
02:04:27.553 --> 02:04:31.724
- They're coming through Beersheba.
- I know, but we've gone to Gaza.

928
02:04:31.891 --> 02:04:36.520
- So?
- So that left Aqaba behind your right.

929
02:04:37.062 --> 02:04:38.105
True.

930
02:04:38.314 --> 02:04:42.943
And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.

931
02:04:43.819 --> 02:04:46.238
Am I going for Jerusalem?

932
02:04:46.572 --> 02:04:47.740
Yes.

933
02:04:50.075 --> 02:04:51.535
Very well.

934
02:04:51.744 --> 02:04:54.038
Aqaba behind my right.

935
02:04:54.246 --> 02:04:57.124
It threatened El' ArTsh and Gaza.

936
02:04:58.584 --> 02:04:59.835
Anything else?

937
02:05:00.085 --> 02:05:01.295
Yes.

938
02:05:01.587 --> 02:05:04.048
Aqaba's linked with Medina.

939
02:05:04.590 --> 02:05:07.593
Do you think we should shift them
out of Medina now?

940
02:05:07.843 --> 02:05:11.430
No. I think you should
leave them there.

941
02:05:11.597 --> 02:05:13.599
You acted without orders, you know.

942
02:05:14.308 --> 02:05:18.562
Shouldn't officers use
their initiative at all times?

943
02:05:18.771 --> 02:05:21.106
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.

944
02:05:21.315 --> 02:05:23.651
Yes, I know.

945
02:05:23.943 --> 02:05:25.486
Already?

946
02:05:25.778 --> 02:05:26.946
Yes.

947
02:05:28.697 --> 02:05:31.325
I'm promoting you major.

948
02:05:32.326 --> 02:05:34.620
I don't think that's a very good idea.

949
02:05:34.787 --> 02:05:37.873
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...

950
02:05:38.123 --> 02:05:41.794
...and carry on the good work.

951
02:05:42.294 --> 02:05:45.130
No. Thank you, sir.

952
02:05:45.631 --> 02:05:49.593
- Why not?
- Well, I, it's...

953
02:05:49.802 --> 02:05:51.136
Let me see now...

954
02:05:52.846 --> 02:05:56.600
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.

955
02:05:56.809 --> 02:05:59.019
One was a boy.

956
02:05:59.228 --> 02:06:00.688
That was...

957
02:06:02.314 --> 02:06:04.149
...yesterday.

958
02:06:04.358 --> 02:06:06.402
I led him into a quicksand.

959
02:06:06.652 --> 02:06:08.320
The other was a man.

960
02:06:08.654 --> 02:06:10.614
That was...

961
02:06:10.823 --> 02:06:13.242
...before Aqaba, anyway.

962
02:06:13.909 --> 02:06:16.620
I had to execute him with my pistol.

963
02:06:17.121 --> 02:06:20.165
There was something about it
I didn't like.

964
02:06:20.416 --> 02:06:23.544
- Well, naturally.
- No. Something else.

965
02:06:25.838 --> 02:06:28.173
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.

966
02:06:28.382 --> 02:06:30.509
No. Something else.

967
02:06:32.136 --> 02:06:33.721
What, then?

968
02:06:34.638 --> 02:06:37.016
I enjoyed it.

969
02:06:44.523 --> 02:06:48.027
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.

970
02:06:49.778 --> 02:06:53.407
What do you mean coming dressed
like that? Amateur theatricals?

971
02:06:53.657 --> 02:06:55.367
Yes. Entirely.

972
02:06:55.576 --> 02:06:58.704
Let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is.

973
02:06:59.038 --> 02:07:01.040
Fascinating gear they wear.

974
02:07:01.290 --> 02:07:03.542
How would I look in this, Harry?

975
02:07:03.751 --> 02:07:07.254
- Damn ridiculous, sir.
- Here, you keep it.

976
02:07:08.172 --> 02:07:12.259
What I'm trying to say
is I don't think I'm fit for it.

977
02:07:12.468 --> 02:07:15.387
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

978
02:07:16.388 --> 02:07:20.976
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said
it couldn't be done.

979
02:07:21.310 --> 02:07:24.313
- Brighton?
- I know what he thinks.

980
02:07:25.481 --> 02:07:28.817
I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

981
02:07:29.193 --> 02:07:32.071
I don't think it matters
what his motives were.

982
02:07:32.279 --> 02:07:35.407
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

983
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:38.827
- Mr. Perkins!
- Sir!

984
02:07:39.078 --> 02:07:41.705
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

985
02:07:45.751 --> 02:07:49.129
- You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
- Yes, sir.

986
02:07:49.338 --> 02:07:53.634
- What do you think about it?
- Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.

987
02:07:53.842 --> 02:07:56.929
- Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
- Sir!

988
02:08:02.601 --> 02:08:04.228
Come on, then.

989
02:08:07.815 --> 02:08:09.608
You're a clever man, sir.

990
02:08:09.942 --> 02:08:13.529
No, but I know a good thing
when I see one.

991
02:08:13.779 --> 02:08:16.490
That's fair, surely?

992
02:08:37.010 --> 02:08:42.141
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.

993
02:08:42.349 --> 02:08:44.643
- Bravo.
- You know better?

994
02:09:04.204 --> 02:09:07.040
I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

995
02:09:07.291 --> 02:09:09.668
We should do very well indeed,
shouldn't we?

996
02:09:46.246 --> 02:09:48.707
Easy, gentlemen, please.

997
02:09:49.875 --> 02:09:52.085
- Give us something to drink.
- Of course, sir.

998
02:09:52.586 --> 02:09:56.215
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

999
02:09:56.965 --> 02:09:58.133
Tracy.

1000
02:10:00.052 --> 02:10:01.887
Shall we go outside?

1001
02:10:13.065 --> 02:10:16.360
So you hold bound the Turkish
desert army?

1002
02:10:16.568 --> 02:10:17.611
Yes.

1003
02:10:17.861 --> 02:10:20.155
With 1000 Arabs?

1004
02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:24.409
1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.

1005
02:10:24.576 --> 02:10:26.578
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

1006
02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:28.789
It means 1000 camels.

1007
02:10:29.081 --> 02:10:33.377
That means 1000 packs of high
explosives and 1000 crack rifles.

1008
02:10:33.919 --> 02:10:37.673
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.

1009
02:10:38.257 --> 02:10:40.175
I'll smash his railways.

1010
02:10:40.425 --> 02:10:42.928
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

1011
02:10:43.178 --> 02:10:45.973
In 13 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.

1012
02:10:46.265 --> 02:10:48.600
You are going back, then?

1013
02:10:51.436 --> 02:10:52.688
Yes.

1014
02:10:53.105 --> 02:10:55.440
Of course I'm going back.

1015
02:10:59.778 --> 02:11:02.197
Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.

1016
02:11:02.447 --> 02:11:06.702
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits...

1017
02:11:06.952 --> 02:11:08.120
...he'll withdraw.

1018
02:11:08.287 --> 02:11:11.039
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

1019
02:11:11.290 --> 02:11:13.792
If he gets out now,
he'll never get back again.

1020
02:11:14.042 --> 02:11:16.545
- I wonder who will.
- No one will.

1021
02:11:17.170 --> 02:11:19.423
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

1022
02:11:25.429 --> 02:11:27.723
That's what I've told them anyway.

1023
02:11:28.181 --> 02:11:30.017
That's what they think.

1024
02:11:30.475 --> 02:11:33.729
- That's why they're fighting.
- Oh, surely.

1025
02:11:36.690 --> 02:11:38.984
They've only one suspicion.

1026
02:11:39.443 --> 02:11:43.822
That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

1027
02:11:44.031 --> 02:11:48.535
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1028
02:11:48.744 --> 02:11:49.828
Have we?

1029
02:11:50.329 --> 02:11:52.497
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1030
02:11:52.706 --> 02:11:55.834
Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?

1031
02:11:56.835 --> 02:11:59.087
Difficult question, sir.

1032
02:12:01.089 --> 02:12:04.885
I want to know, sir,
if I can tell them in your name...

1033
02:12:05.093 --> 02:12:08.513
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

1034
02:12:09.556 --> 02:12:11.058
Certainly.

1035
02:12:28.575 --> 02:12:32.037
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.

1036
02:12:32.245 --> 02:12:33.413
Right.

1037
02:12:33.705 --> 02:12:37.042
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.

1038
02:12:38.043 --> 02:12:41.421
- Instructors for the Lewis guns.
- Right.

1039
02:12:41.630 --> 02:12:43.215
More money.

1040
02:12:43.548 --> 02:12:46.718
- How much more?
-25,000 now. A lot more later.

1041
02:12:46.927 --> 02:12:49.638
- Dryden?
- It can be done, sir.

1042
02:12:49.888 --> 02:12:52.724
A couple of armoured cars.

1043
02:12:52.891 --> 02:12:54.267
Right.

1044
02:12:55.018 --> 02:12:56.561
Field artillery.

1045
02:12:58.730 --> 02:13:00.107
Right.

1046
02:13:03.068 --> 02:13:05.320
I'll give you every
blessed thing I can...

1047
02:13:05.570 --> 02:13:08.448
...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.

1048
02:13:08.657 --> 02:13:11.410
Thank you for your hospitality,
gentlemen.

1049
02:13:47.070 --> 02:13:48.947
Congratulations!

1050
02:13:59.207 --> 02:14:02.294
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?

1051
02:14:02.502 --> 02:14:04.337
I was wondering that, sir.

1052
02:14:04.588 --> 02:14:06.798
Might be difficult to get it back.

1053
02:14:07.007 --> 02:14:10.594
Give them artillery and you've made
them independent.

1054
02:14:10.802 --> 02:14:12.721
Then I can't give it to them, can I?

1055
02:14:12.971 --> 02:14:14.890
- For you to say.
- No, it's not.

1056
02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:17.893
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

1057
02:14:18.143 --> 02:14:20.103
Not like that poor devil.

1058
02:14:20.604 --> 02:14:22.147
He's riding the whirlwind.

1059
02:14:22.355 --> 02:14:24.593
Let's hope we're not.

1060
02:15:17.650 --> 02:15:20.903
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?

1061
02:15:21.445 --> 02:15:22.655
To Prince Feisal.

1062
02:15:22.905 --> 02:15:25.658
- You're not Prince Feisal?
- No.

1063
02:15:25.950 --> 02:15:27.284
You know him though?

1064
02:15:27.451 --> 02:15:30.955
He is my master. I am his servant.

1065
02:15:34.125 --> 02:15:35.459
Can you read?

1066
02:15:44.135 --> 02:15:48.639
Chicago Courier is my paper,
but my work is syndicated in America.

1067
02:15:48.889 --> 02:15:52.434
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.

1068
02:16:06.615 --> 02:16:07.783
Now...

1069
02:16:08.993 --> 02:16:12.955
- Where can I find Major Lawrence?
- Is that what you have come for?

1070
02:16:13.164 --> 02:16:15.291
Not altogether, sir, no.

1071
02:16:15.541 --> 02:16:19.920
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

1072
02:16:20.129 --> 02:16:23.215
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?

1073
02:16:23.507 --> 02:16:24.675
I don't know.

1074
02:16:25.342 --> 02:16:28.012
- Last week they were near El Ghira.
- Ghira?

1075
02:16:28.220 --> 02:16:32.057
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

1076
02:16:33.017 --> 02:16:35.644
- I've never tried.
- Take a mule.

1077
02:16:36.187 --> 02:16:38.314
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.

1078
02:16:38.689 --> 02:16:41.317
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

1079
02:16:41.525 --> 02:16:42.818
They do.

1080
02:16:43.027 --> 02:16:46.197
But not so fast as we do,
you will find.

1081
02:16:46.530 --> 02:16:48.032
Myself...

1082
02:16:48.657 --> 02:16:50.534
...I am going to Cairo.

1083
02:16:50.743 --> 02:16:52.745
- As you know.
- Yes.

1084
02:16:52.995 --> 02:16:55.497
There's work for me there
of a different kind.

1085
02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:57.249
Yes.

1086
02:17:00.836 --> 02:17:03.214
I understand you've
been given no artillery.

1087
02:17:03.672 --> 02:17:06.217
- That is so.
- You're handicapped?

1088
02:17:06.383 --> 02:17:08.469
It restricts us to small things.

1089
02:17:08.677 --> 02:17:09.970
It's intended to.

1090
02:17:12.681 --> 02:17:14.266
Do you know General Allenby?

1091
02:17:15.267 --> 02:17:18.729
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.

1092
02:17:19.063 --> 02:17:21.732
- Excuse me?
- A clever man.

1093
02:17:22.024 --> 02:17:24.902
Slim customer. It's very good.

1094
02:17:25.194 --> 02:17:29.740
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.

1095
02:17:30.032 --> 02:17:33.535
Your Highness, we Americans were
once a colonial people.

1096
02:17:33.744 --> 02:17:36.121
We naturally feel
sympathetic to any people...

1097
02:17:36.372 --> 02:17:38.582
...who struggle for their freedom.

1098
02:17:38.749 --> 02:17:41.001
Very gratifying.

1099
02:17:43.754 --> 02:17:48.092
Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your story told.

1100
02:17:48.259 --> 02:17:50.594
I badly want a story to tell.

1101
02:17:50.803 --> 02:17:54.598
Ah, now you are talking turkey,
are you not?

1102
02:17:55.266 --> 02:17:58.102
I will give you a guide and a letter.

1103
02:17:58.310 --> 02:18:00.271
And before I leave here...

1104
02:18:00.562 --> 02:18:02.898
...which must be presently...

1105
02:18:03.107 --> 02:18:06.610
...I will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you.

1106
02:18:08.404 --> 02:18:11.657
You know that we are
destroying the Turkish railways.

1107
02:18:11.907 --> 02:18:13.033
I do, sir.

1108
02:18:13.242 --> 02:18:16.161
Major Lawrence is in charge
of all this, is he?

1109
02:18:16.412 --> 02:18:18.914
My army is made up of tribes.

1110
02:18:19.123 --> 02:18:22.126
The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.

1111
02:18:22.293 --> 02:18:25.462
Your people do think very highly
of Major Lawrence?

1112
02:18:25.671 --> 02:18:28.757
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

1113
02:18:29.341 --> 02:18:32.678
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

1114
02:18:33.554 --> 02:18:36.974
...the man who gives victory
in battle is prized...

1115
02:18:37.141 --> 02:18:39.810
...beyond every other man.

1116
02:18:40.477 --> 02:18:43.647
One figure I can give you
from my head...

1117
02:18:43.814 --> 02:18:47.484
...because it never leaves my head.

1118
02:18:47.985 --> 02:18:52.072
Since starting this campaign
four months ago, we have lost...

1119
02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:55.451
...37 wounded...

1120
02:18:57.995 --> 02:19:01.332
...156 dead.

1121
02:19:02.875 --> 02:19:07.671
You remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded.

1122
02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:09.173
Yeah.

1123
02:19:09.506 --> 02:19:10.883
Four times as many.

1124
02:19:11.133 --> 02:19:15.846
That's because those too wounded
to bring away, we ourselves kill.

1125
02:19:16.096 --> 02:19:18.599
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1126
02:19:19.016 --> 02:19:22.686
- You mean...?
- We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1127
02:19:23.187 --> 02:19:26.607
In their eyes, we are not
soldiers but rebels.

1128
02:19:26.815 --> 02:19:31.320
Rebels, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code...

1129
02:19:31.528 --> 02:19:33.405
...and are treated harshly.

1130
02:19:34.114 --> 02:19:35.199
How harshly?

1131
02:19:35.491 --> 02:19:38.369
More harshly than I hope
you can imagine.

1132
02:19:39.161 --> 02:19:40.204
I see.

1133
02:19:40.371 --> 02:19:43.624
Our own prisoners are taken care of
until the British...

1134
02:19:43.832 --> 02:19:47.669
...can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.

1135
02:19:47.878 --> 02:19:51.924
- I should like you to notice that.
- Yes, sir.

1136
02:19:52.925 --> 02:19:55.552
Is that the influence
of Major Lawrence?

1137
02:19:56.011 --> 02:19:57.388
Why should you suppose?

1138
02:19:57.638 --> 02:20:00.057
It's just that I heard
in Cairo that...

1139
02:20:00.265 --> 02:20:02.726
...Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.

1140
02:20:02.935 --> 02:20:04.645
That is exactly so.

1141
02:20:04.853 --> 02:20:08.357
With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.

1142
02:20:08.690 --> 02:20:11.568
With me, it is merely good manners.

1143
02:20:11.735 --> 02:20:15.906
You may judge which motive
is the more reliable.

1144
02:20:16.532 --> 02:20:19.910
- And now, perhaps...
- Oh, sure, sure.

1145
02:20:24.039 --> 02:20:25.707
Thank you, sir.

1146
02:20:25.916 --> 02:20:27.668
Can you manage the letter--?

1147
02:20:27.918 --> 02:20:30.754
I'll do everything I have said...

1148
02:20:30.963 --> 02:20:34.550
...if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest...

1149
02:20:34.758 --> 02:20:37.177
...in my people and Major Lawrence.

1150
02:20:39.096 --> 02:20:42.224
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.

1151
02:20:42.433 --> 02:20:44.935
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.

1152
02:20:45.269 --> 02:20:46.270
Oh, no.

1153
02:20:46.562 --> 02:20:50.315
But influential men back home believe
it's time for America...

1154
02:20:50.566 --> 02:20:53.277
...to lend her weight to
the struggle against Germany.

1155
02:20:53.485 --> 02:20:55.487
And Turkey.

1156
02:20:55.779 --> 02:21:00.117
I've been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is...

1157
02:21:00.617 --> 02:21:03.078
- Enjoyable?
- Hardly that, sir.

1158
02:21:03.287 --> 02:21:06.290
But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

1159
02:21:06.498 --> 02:21:10.127
You look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.

1160
02:21:11.712 --> 02:21:13.505
All right. Yes.

1161
02:21:14.131 --> 02:21:15.799
Lawrence is your man.

1162
02:21:55.672 --> 02:21:56.673
Stop!

1163
02:22:16.068 --> 02:22:17.694
Stop it!

1164
02:22:18.529 --> 02:22:19.905
Stop it!

1165
02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:29.581
Come on, men!

1166
02:23:38.775 --> 02:23:40.110
Lawrence!

1167
02:24:00.797 --> 02:24:02.799
Good God! God!

1168
02:24:49.179 --> 02:24:53.975
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed
with a sword before.

1169
02:24:54.226 --> 02:24:56.478
Why don't you take a picture?

1170
02:24:56.853 --> 02:24:58.146
Wish I had.

1171
02:25:02.359 --> 02:25:04.569
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

1172
02:25:06.822 --> 02:25:07.864
Am I in this?

1173
02:25:08.865 --> 02:25:10.575
Did you take his picture?

1174
02:25:10.826 --> 02:25:12.077
Yeah.

1175
02:25:16.498 --> 02:25:20.669
You are using up your nine lives
very quickly.

1176
02:25:23.171 --> 02:25:25.215
Charming company you keep.

1177
02:25:25.465 --> 02:25:26.717
Auda?

1178
02:25:27.509 --> 02:25:32.556
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue.

1179
02:25:32.889 --> 02:25:34.975
He thinks you're a kind of thief.

1180
02:25:35.225 --> 02:25:37.352
It's all right to take your picture?

1181
02:25:37.894 --> 02:25:39.396
- All right.
- Okay.

1182
02:25:39.604 --> 02:25:41.064
Just walk.

1183
02:26:41.291 --> 02:26:43.460
Major Lawrence!

1184
02:26:44.085 --> 02:26:46.797
Yes, sir, that's my baby.

1185
02:26:54.805 --> 02:26:57.432
This looting has got to stop!

1186
02:26:57.641 --> 02:26:58.975
It is customary.

1187
02:26:59.267 --> 02:27:02.813
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.

1188
02:27:03.104 --> 02:27:05.315
I would not say that to Auda.

1189
02:27:05.816 --> 02:27:08.610
- It is their payment, colonel.
- Payment.

1190
02:27:08.819 --> 02:27:11.613
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

1191
02:27:12.489 --> 02:27:15.826
- They don't go home when being paid.
- They are not free to.

1192
02:27:20.622 --> 02:27:24.709
Well, there's another lot you've
seen the last of.

1193
02:27:25.001 --> 02:27:26.628
They'll come back.

1194
02:27:27.462 --> 02:27:30.382
He says they'll come back.
Will they?

1195
02:27:30.674 --> 02:27:32.843
Not this year, Lawrence.

1196
02:27:33.593 --> 02:27:38.014
Look, Lawrence, how many men do
you think you'll have left? 200?

1197
02:27:38.223 --> 02:27:41.017
- Less.
- Well, then?

1198
02:27:41.351 --> 02:27:43.687
I said, they'll come back.

1199
02:27:44.396 --> 02:27:45.605
You badly hurt?

1200
02:27:47.148 --> 02:27:48.900
Not hurt at all.

1201
02:27:49.150 --> 02:27:53.321
Didn't you know? They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.

1202
02:28:09.045 --> 02:28:12.883
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.

1203
02:28:13.341 --> 02:28:16.887
- What are you learning from this?
- Politics.

1204
02:28:17.554 --> 02:28:22.058
You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

1205
02:28:22.726 --> 02:28:25.020
I will tell you that
when I have a country.

1206
02:28:27.272 --> 02:28:28.565
Did I answer well?

1207
02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:33.153
You answered without
saying anything. That's politics.

1208
02:28:34.404 --> 02:28:36.072
You learn quickly.

1209
02:28:37.407 --> 02:28:39.576
I have a good teacher.

1210
02:28:42.203 --> 02:28:43.580
Yeah.

1211
02:28:51.296 --> 02:28:53.173
- How's your hurt?
- Fine.

1212
02:28:53.381 --> 02:28:58.219
Before I return to the fleshpots,
which I shall be very glad to do...

1213
02:28:58.428 --> 02:29:01.473
...may I put two questions to you,
straight?

1214
02:29:01.765 --> 02:29:05.101
I'd be interested to hear you put
a question straight.

1215
02:29:05.310 --> 02:29:06.478
One.

1216
02:29:06.937 --> 02:29:10.899
What, in your opinion, do these people
hope to gain from this war?

1217
02:29:11.191 --> 02:29:13.610
They hope to gain their freedom.

1218
02:29:14.903 --> 02:29:15.946
Freedom.

1219
02:29:17.238 --> 02:29:20.075
"They hope to gain their freedom."

1220
02:29:20.283 --> 02:29:23.954
- There's one born every minute.
- They're going to get it.

1221
02:29:24.746 --> 02:29:26.957
I'm going to give it to them.

1222
02:29:28.625 --> 02:29:34.464
- The second question?
- Well, I was going to ask...

1223
02:29:34.965 --> 02:29:38.927
...what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert?

1224
02:29:40.929 --> 02:29:42.973
It's clean.

1225
02:29:45.809 --> 02:29:47.352
Well, now...

1226
02:29:48.228 --> 02:29:50.355
...that's a very illuminating answer.

1227
02:29:50.730 --> 02:29:52.357
May I...

1228
02:29:52.983 --> 02:29:55.485
...take one farewell picture?

1229
02:29:56.319 --> 02:29:59.364
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

1230
02:29:59.656 --> 02:30:02.617
One clock for two lamps.

1231
02:30:03.118 --> 02:30:04.327
A fair bargain.

1232
02:30:04.536 --> 02:30:07.163
Fair? I robbed him.

1233
02:30:18.633 --> 02:30:20.135
Trash.

1234
02:30:21.261 --> 02:30:23.680
I must find something honourable.

1235
02:30:23.972 --> 02:30:25.515
Honourable?

1236
02:30:26.141 --> 02:30:29.894
The year is running out, Brighton.

1237
02:30:34.315 --> 02:30:37.318
I must find something honourable.

1238
02:33:08.845 --> 02:33:11.014
Now you may blow up my train.

1239
02:33:11.306 --> 02:33:13.016
And what will you do now?

1240
02:33:13.224 --> 02:33:17.812
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.

1241
02:33:18.563 --> 02:33:20.565
They will carry my toys too, see?

1242
02:33:20.982 --> 02:33:24.027
Major Lawrence will campaign
this winter.

1243
02:33:24.319 --> 02:33:27.697
But you got what you wanted,
so you're going home, is that it?

1244
02:33:27.864 --> 02:33:32.535
Of course. When Lawrence has got
what he wants, he will go home.

1245
02:33:32.744 --> 02:33:35.330
When you've got what you want,
you will go home.

1246
02:33:35.538 --> 02:33:37.207
No, I shan't, Auda.

1247
02:33:37.999 --> 02:33:39.375
Then you are a fool.

1248
02:33:40.043 --> 02:33:43.046
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

1249
02:33:44.172 --> 02:33:46.382
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

1250
02:33:46.591 --> 02:33:49.719
...that when he made you a fool,
he gave you a fool's face.

1251
02:33:50.970 --> 02:33:53.056
You are an impudent rascal.

1252
02:33:54.557 --> 02:33:58.895
I must go, Lawrence, before I
soil myself with a fool's blood.

1253
02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:11.032
Like talking to a brick wall.

1254
02:34:19.707 --> 02:34:22.377
So what will you do now?
What can you do?

1255
02:34:23.044 --> 02:34:24.754
I'll go north.

1256
02:34:26.089 --> 02:34:27.924
That's what Allenby wants.

1257
02:34:28.132 --> 02:34:32.262
Allenby wanted the Arab army
behind Deraa.

1258
02:34:32.512 --> 02:34:34.764
Then that's where I'll take it.

1259
02:34:35.765 --> 02:34:40.603
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be
in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.

1260
02:34:40.895 --> 02:34:42.063
Won't we?

1261
02:35:14.554 --> 02:35:15.596
Train, Farraj.

1262
02:35:16.639 --> 02:35:18.141
Yeah, Lawrence.

1263
02:35:47.337 --> 02:35:49.172
Hide yourself, my friend.

1264
02:35:58.389 --> 02:35:59.849
Detonator.

1265
02:36:13.363 --> 02:36:15.031
All right, fetch another.

1266
02:36:15.239 --> 02:36:19.035
- Pardon, Lawrence. I put--
- Plenty of time. Fetch another.

1267
02:36:24.499 --> 02:36:25.875
F array?

1268
02:36:36.177 --> 02:36:39.222
- What happened?
- Detonator. A detonator!

1269
02:36:52.735 --> 02:36:55.238
He cannot ride, Lawrence. Look.

1270
02:37:04.747 --> 02:37:07.583
If they take him alive,
you know what they'll do to him.

1271
02:37:19.971 --> 02:37:22.432
Daud will be angry with you.

1272
02:37:23.433 --> 02:37:25.309
Salute him for me.

1273
02:37:45.121 --> 02:37:46.789
What will you do now?

1274
02:37:48.249 --> 02:37:49.750
Go north.

1275
02:37:49.959 --> 02:37:51.419
With twenty?

1276
02:37:52.295 --> 02:37:54.755
What would
you recommend me to do?

1277
02:37:56.466 --> 02:37:58.468
What would you recommend?

1278
02:38:03.473 --> 02:38:05.808
He hasn't 1/10 so many men, sir.

1279
02:38:05.975 --> 02:38:07.852
He's lied, in fact.

1280
02:38:09.228 --> 02:38:12.940
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have
done anything he hasn't done.

1281
02:38:13.149 --> 02:38:15.818
Then there is an Arab north army.

1282
02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:21.824
- No, sir, he has lied about that.
- Any idea Why?

1283
02:38:22.241 --> 02:38:26.245
- It's his army, I suppose.
- It's Prince Feisal's army.

1284
02:38:27.663 --> 02:38:30.166
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?

1285
02:38:31.501 --> 02:38:33.127
No.

1286
02:38:34.170 --> 02:38:37.882
He would if he could, I think.

1287
02:38:39.675 --> 02:38:43.137
- Not my line of country.
- It doesn't matter. Just curious.

1288
02:38:43.846 --> 02:38:46.057
What matters is I believed it.

1289
02:38:46.349 --> 02:38:48.017
The Turks believe it.

1290
02:38:48.309 --> 02:38:51.687
They are offering 20,000 pounds
for him.

1291
02:38:53.648 --> 02:38:55.399
Good heavens.

1292
02:38:55.858 --> 02:38:59.570
- Shouldn't say he had long to live.
- Whatever else, he's a brave man--

1293
02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:04.200
Surely, surely. If he's still going north
with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.

1294
02:39:05.368 --> 02:39:08.162
I wonder if they'd offer that much
for me.

1295
02:39:09.872 --> 02:39:14.001
What about next year?
Will they still come back?

1296
02:39:14.210 --> 02:39:16.212
I wouldn't be surprised.

1297
02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:20.049
- They think he's a kind of prophet.
- They do or he does?

1298
02:39:35.690 --> 02:39:38.234
- Now may I speak?
- Yes.

1299
02:39:38.901 --> 02:39:42.071
One more failure and you will find
yourself alone.

1300
02:39:43.447 --> 02:39:46.951
- I do not include myself.
- I do not include the others.

1301
02:39:47.243 --> 02:39:49.412
So say they love you.

1302
02:39:49.870 --> 02:39:52.373
The more reason to be thrifty
with them.

1303
02:39:52.582 --> 02:39:55.710
Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.

1304
02:39:55.918 --> 02:39:58.087
They must move mountains,
walk on water.

1305
02:39:58.337 --> 02:40:01.549
That's right. That's right.

1306
02:40:02.133 --> 02:40:04.635
Who are you to know
what can be done?

1307
02:40:05.094 --> 02:40:08.764
If we'd done what you thought could
be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.

1308
02:40:09.348 --> 02:40:13.769
Whatever I ask them to do can
be done. They know that if you don't.

1309
02:40:15.896 --> 02:40:18.858
Do you think I'm just anybody?

1310
02:40:19.358 --> 02:40:20.735
Do you?

1311
02:40:23.946 --> 02:40:27.283
My friends, who will walk on water
with me?

1312
02:40:30.745 --> 02:40:35.124
- Who will come with me into Deraa?
- Deraa is garrisoned.

1313
02:40:35.291 --> 02:40:37.418
Will you take 20 against 2000?

1314
02:40:37.627 --> 02:40:41.380
- I'll go by myself if I have to.
- Why?

1315
02:40:41.631 --> 02:40:43.466
Because I told the English generals...

1316
02:40:43.758 --> 02:40:47.386
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they'd be in Jerusalem.

1317
02:40:47.803 --> 02:40:49.930
Or perhaps you are here...

1318
02:40:50.514 --> 02:40:52.475
...for the English generals.

1319
02:40:54.518 --> 02:40:56.187
Who says this?

1320
02:40:56.479 --> 02:40:57.813
Rumour.

1321
02:40:59.148 --> 02:41:01.651
That is not an argument.

1322
02:41:01.901 --> 02:41:04.111
Oh, argument.

1323
02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:07.657
This afternoon I will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa...

1324
02:41:07.948 --> 02:41:10.326
...while the Arabs argue.

1325
02:41:12.286 --> 02:41:15.414
Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?

1326
02:41:15.790 --> 02:41:19.543
Yes. If one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes.

1327
02:41:28.803 --> 02:41:30.012
It's madness.

1328
02:41:33.516 --> 02:41:35.309
What are you looking for?

1329
02:41:35.518 --> 02:41:38.020
Some way to announce myself.

1330
02:41:38.229 --> 02:41:40.189
Be patient with him, God.

1331
02:41:53.577 --> 02:41:57.873
- Do you not see how they look at you?
- Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

1332
02:41:58.040 --> 02:41:59.375
Halt!

1333
02:41:59.583 --> 02:42:00.835
Walk on.

1334
02:42:01.043 --> 02:42:02.878
- Halt!
- Walk on.

1335
02:42:04.046 --> 02:42:06.215
You and you.

1336
02:43:47.358 --> 02:43:48.442
You.

1337
02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.002
You have blue eyes.

1338
02:44:07.878 --> 02:44:12.132
- I say you have blue eyes.
- Yes, effendi.

1339
02:44:12.341 --> 02:44:15.636
- Are you Circassian?
- Yes, effendi.

1340
02:44:16.512 --> 02:44:18.097
How old are you?

1341
02:44:18.347 --> 02:44:21.350
Twenty-seven, effendi.

1342
02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:23.477
I think.

1343
02:44:23.686 --> 02:44:28.232
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.

1344
02:44:29.525 --> 02:44:31.610
It's an interesting face.

1345
02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:38.701
I am surrounded by cattle.

1346
02:44:39.368 --> 02:44:43.038
He wouldn't know an interesting face
from a sow's belly.

1347
02:44:44.039 --> 02:44:48.043
I have been is Deraa now
for three and a half years.

1348
02:44:48.252 --> 02:44:52.673
If they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, I could not be more...

1349
02:44:52.882 --> 02:44:54.717
...isolated.

1350
02:44:56.635 --> 02:44:59.221
You haven't the least idea
what I'm talking about.

1351
02:44:59.513 --> 02:45:01.223
No, effendi.

1352
02:45:03.767 --> 02:45:05.185
Have you?

1353
02:45:06.395 --> 02:45:07.688
No.

1354
02:45:08.397 --> 02:45:10.232
That would be too...

1355
02:45:10.441 --> 02:45:12.067
...lucky.

1356
02:45:36.550 --> 02:45:38.302
Where did you get that?

1357
02:45:40.220 --> 02:45:44.391
- It's old, effendi.
- No, this is recent.

1358
02:45:46.435 --> 02:45:48.687
- You are a deserter.
- No, effendi.

1359
02:45:48.938 --> 02:45:50.814
Yes, you are a deserter.

1360
02:45:51.941 --> 02:45:54.193
But from which army?

1361
02:45:56.695 --> 02:45:58.948
Not that it matters at all.

1362
02:45:59.281 --> 02:46:01.617
A man cannot be always in uniform.

1363
02:46:13.128 --> 02:46:15.089
Your skin is very fair.

1364
02:46:33.983 --> 02:46:35.275
Beat him.

1365
02:48:09.828 --> 02:48:11.205
To me!

1366
02:50:13.702 --> 02:50:15.245
Sleep.

1367
02:50:17.039 --> 02:50:18.582
Sleep.

1368
02:50:30.385 --> 02:50:31.720
Eat.

1369
02:50:37.559 --> 02:50:38.852
Eat.

1370
02:50:42.689 --> 02:50:45.525
You have a body, like other men.

1371
02:50:54.034 --> 02:50:55.077
Good.

1372
02:50:56.245 --> 02:50:58.038
Then sleep.

1373
02:51:11.551 --> 02:51:12.803
Better?

1374
02:51:13.428 --> 02:51:16.139
Much better. You were right.

1375
02:51:16.431 --> 02:51:18.600
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

1376
02:51:19.559 --> 02:51:21.603
Oh, I've learned all right.

1377
02:51:27.401 --> 02:51:29.111
I'm going, Ali.

1378
02:51:30.153 --> 02:51:32.281
- Why?
- Why?

1379
02:51:33.573 --> 02:51:34.825
Heavens.

1380
02:51:35.117 --> 02:51:36.410
Why?

1381
02:51:37.286 --> 02:51:39.538
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.

1382
02:51:39.788 --> 02:51:41.790
And the end of the Arab revolt?

1383
02:51:42.082 --> 02:51:45.168
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.

1384
02:51:45.460 --> 02:51:48.463
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.

1385
02:51:48.755 --> 02:51:51.758
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

1386
02:51:51.967 --> 02:51:53.927
You proved it.

1387
02:51:54.136 --> 02:51:56.305
Look, Ali. Look.

1388
02:51:56.596 --> 02:52:00.350
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.

1389
02:52:01.143 --> 02:52:03.478
And there's nothing I can do about it.

1390
02:52:03.645 --> 02:52:06.315
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.

1391
02:52:08.108 --> 02:52:09.568
He can...

1392
02:52:09.776 --> 02:52:12.654
...but he can't want what he wants.

1393
02:52:13.613 --> 02:52:16.825
This is the stuff that decides what
he wants.

1394
02:52:19.661 --> 02:52:23.457
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.

1395
02:52:23.665 --> 02:52:27.627
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.

1396
02:52:27.836 --> 02:52:30.630
- I tried to.
- So would any man.

1397
02:52:30.839 --> 02:52:34.343
Well, any man is what I am.

1398
02:52:35.344 --> 02:52:39.348
And I'm going back to Allenby to
ask him for a job...

1399
02:52:39.639 --> 02:52:41.683
...that any man can do.

1400
02:52:41.975 --> 02:52:43.852
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

1401
02:52:44.144 --> 02:52:46.855
- I'll make easy stages.
- You?

1402
02:52:48.398 --> 02:52:51.860
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1403
02:52:53.653 --> 02:52:58.200
Look, Ali, I think I see
a way of being just...

1404
02:52:58.408 --> 02:53:00.035
...ordinarily...

1405
02:53:00.702 --> 02:53:02.120
...happy

1406
02:53:05.916 --> 02:53:07.542
Can I take this?

1407
02:53:08.168 --> 02:53:10.045
It is not clean.

1408
02:53:10.337 --> 02:53:13.382
No, but it's warm.

1409
02:53:13.757 --> 02:53:15.050
And these...

1410
02:53:15.258 --> 02:53:19.221
...having led them here,
have you no care for them?

1411
02:53:20.722 --> 02:53:25.894
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

1412
02:53:28.146 --> 02:53:30.357
And let me go back to mine.

1413
02:53:59.469 --> 02:54:02.597
- I say, don't forget those form fives.
- All right.

1414
02:54:08.437 --> 02:54:10.272
Mind if I join you?

1415
02:54:11.106 --> 02:54:12.774
Honoured, sir.

1416
02:54:15.110 --> 02:54:18.447
- Good to be back.
- We heard you were, sir.

1417
02:54:18.989 --> 02:54:21.575
- What's doing out there?
- Where?

1418
02:54:21.783 --> 02:54:24.077
- Arabia?
- Well, yes, sir.

1419
02:54:24.286 --> 02:54:27.622
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?

1420
02:54:27.914 --> 02:54:30.292
We're settling in.
We built a squash court.

1421
02:54:30.500 --> 02:54:31.960
Jolly good.

1422
02:54:32.794 --> 02:54:36.798
Well, I have to go up there.

1423
02:54:37.799 --> 02:54:40.260
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

1424
02:54:40.469 --> 02:54:42.220
Bloody wogs.

1425
02:54:43.638 --> 02:54:45.515
Yes, probably.

1426
02:54:46.266 --> 02:54:48.643
Jolly good about the squash court.

1427
02:54:51.354 --> 02:54:53.857
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

1428
02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:08.371
Morning.

1429
02:55:08.538 --> 02:55:10.332
- Good morning, sir.
- Good to be back.

1430
02:55:10.624 --> 02:55:13.668
- I'll believe you, sir.
- No, really it is.

1431
02:55:16.963 --> 02:55:18.298
Hello.

1432
02:55:18.882 --> 02:55:22.010
Morning. You're to go right in.

1433
02:55:34.022 --> 02:55:35.524
Lawrence.

1434
02:55:37.317 --> 02:55:39.861
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1435
02:55:40.529 --> 02:55:41.905
Sir.

1436
02:55:47.702 --> 02:55:49.538
Well, general, I will leave you.

1437
02:55:49.829 --> 02:55:52.707
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make...

1438
02:55:52.999 --> 02:55:56.795
...about my people
and their weakness...

1439
02:55:57.045 --> 02:56:01.841
...and the need to keep them weak
in the British interest.

1440
02:56:04.344 --> 02:56:07.889
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.

1441
02:56:08.056 --> 02:56:10.100
I told you, sir, no such treaty exists.

1442
02:56:10.392 --> 02:56:14.854
Yes, general, you have lied
most bravely, but not convincingly.

1443
02:56:15.063 --> 02:56:17.065
I know this treaty does exist.

1444
02:56:17.315 --> 02:56:19.234
Treaty, sir?

1445
02:56:21.403 --> 02:56:23.405
He does it better than you, general.

1446
02:56:23.697 --> 02:56:26.950
But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.

1447
02:56:41.131 --> 02:56:42.757
You really don't know?

1448
02:56:45.093 --> 02:56:47.095
Then what the devil's this?

1449
02:56:48.096 --> 02:56:51.975
It's my request
for release from Arabia, sir.

1450
02:56:52.225 --> 02:56:53.602
For what reason?

1451
02:56:53.768 --> 02:56:56.104
You sure you haven't heard
of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1452
02:56:56.271 --> 02:56:57.647
No.

1453
02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:01.610
- I can guess.
- Don't guess. Tell him.

1454
02:57:03.403 --> 02:57:04.779
Well, now...

1455
02:57:05.238 --> 02:57:08.283
Mr. Sykes is an English civil servant.

1456
02:57:08.491 --> 02:57:11.620
Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

1457
02:57:11.786 --> 02:57:15.999
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war...

1458
02:57:16.291 --> 02:57:19.628
...France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

1459
02:57:19.919 --> 02:57:21.630
Including Arabia.

1460
02:57:21.921 --> 02:57:25.967
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

1461
02:57:26.176 --> 02:57:29.304
An agreement to that effect.

1462
02:57:29.971 --> 02:57:33.516
There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

1463
02:57:33.808 --> 02:57:36.519
And let's have
no displays of indignation.

1464
02:57:36.811 --> 02:57:39.939
You may not have known,
but you certainly had suspicions.

1465
02:57:40.440 --> 02:57:43.777
If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.

1466
02:57:43.985 --> 02:57:48.448
And a man who tells lies, like me,
merely hides the truth.

1467
02:57:48.657 --> 02:57:53.411
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

1468
02:57:53.995 --> 02:57:57.290
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.

1469
02:57:57.791 --> 02:58:00.168
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1470
02:58:01.670 --> 02:58:03.672
And I want an ordinary job, sir.

1471
02:58:03.922 --> 02:58:06.216
That's my reason for resigning.

1472
02:58:07.509 --> 02:58:09.177
It's personal.

1473
02:58:09.344 --> 02:58:11.554
- Personal?
- Yes, sir.

1474
02:58:11.846 --> 02:58:14.933
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.

1475
02:58:15.183 --> 02:58:18.520
And as it happens, a damned
important one. Are you mad?

1476
02:58:18.812 --> 02:58:22.023
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

1477
02:58:22.232 --> 02:58:24.317
That's my reason too.

1478
02:58:24.484 --> 02:58:29.531
Look, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 16th of next month...

1479
02:58:29.698 --> 02:58:31.700
...and you are part of it.

1480
02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:35.870
Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!

1481
02:58:36.079 --> 02:58:39.999
I don't want to be part
of your big push!

1482
02:58:40.709 --> 02:58:42.752
What about your Arab friends?

1483
02:58:43.002 --> 02:58:46.840
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!

1484
02:58:47.048 --> 02:58:49.217
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

1485
02:58:49.467 --> 02:58:54.556
I've told you, I just want
my ration of common humanity.

1486
02:58:54.848 --> 02:58:57.726
- Lawrence.
- Yes?

1487
02:59:00.478 --> 02:59:03.231
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

1488
02:59:03.481 --> 02:59:05.567
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1489
02:59:05.859 --> 02:59:07.569
Thank you, sir.

1490
02:59:08.611 --> 02:59:10.864
Why don't we...?

1491
02:59:13.408 --> 02:59:15.243
There's blood on your back.

1492
02:59:16.536 --> 02:59:19.622
- Do you want a doctor?
- No.

1493
02:59:20.790 --> 02:59:23.001
Tell me what happened.

1494
02:59:27.922 --> 02:59:30.091
Say, what goes on in there?

1495
02:59:30.884 --> 02:59:32.761
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on!

1496
02:59:33.011 --> 02:59:36.431
- No, really. Nothing at all.
-ls the man in trouble?

1497
02:59:36.639 --> 02:59:40.602
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

1498
02:59:40.894 --> 02:59:44.773
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.

1499
02:59:45.023 --> 02:59:48.443
- What claim?
- I've made that boy a hero.

1500
02:59:48.651 --> 02:59:51.404
When the war's over,
he can be anything he wants.

1501
02:59:51.613 --> 02:59:55.950
Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.

1502
02:59:56.451 --> 02:59:59.287
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

1503
02:59:59.829 --> 03:00:02.290
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

1504
03:00:02.582 --> 03:00:05.335
Always walking away, aren't you?

1505
03:00:05.627 --> 03:00:07.128
Well, I'll tell you.

1506
03:00:07.337 --> 03:00:10.298
It's a clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

1507
03:00:10.548 --> 03:00:13.468
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...

1508
03:00:13.676 --> 03:00:16.471
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

1509
03:00:17.305 --> 03:00:20.308
I believe your name will
be a household word...

1510
03:00:20.809 --> 03:00:24.479
...when you'd have to go to the
war museum to find who Allenby was.

1511
03:00:25.355 --> 03:00:28.274
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.

1512
03:00:28.858 --> 03:00:30.360
Leave me alone.

1513
03:00:30.652 --> 03:00:33.154
- Leave me alone.
- That's a feeble thing to say.

1514
03:00:33.363 --> 03:00:35.990
- I know I'm not ordinary.
- That's not what I'm saying.

1515
03:00:36.199 --> 03:00:38.993
All right, I'm extraordinary.

1516
03:00:40.995 --> 03:00:42.080
What of it'?

1517
03:00:42.455 --> 03:00:45.166
Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.

1518
03:00:45.333 --> 03:00:48.503
It's a terrible thing
for a man to flunk it if he has.

1519
03:00:48.670 --> 03:00:50.839
Are you speaking from experience?

1520
03:00:51.130 --> 03:00:52.507
No.

1521
03:00:52.674 --> 03:00:54.509
You're guessing, then.

1522
03:00:55.677 --> 03:00:57.011
Suppose you're wrong.

1523
03:00:57.303 --> 03:01:00.348
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

1524
03:01:01.182 --> 03:01:04.143
- Yes. I said, yes.
- After all--

1525
03:01:06.688 --> 03:01:08.731
- The 16th?
- Can you do it?

1526
03:01:08.898 --> 03:01:11.025
I'll give you a lot of money.

1527
03:01:11.317 --> 03:01:14.153
- Artillery?
- I can't.

1528
03:01:15.363 --> 03:01:18.324
They won't be coming for money,
not the best of them.

1529
03:01:18.616 --> 03:01:20.827
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1530
03:01:21.870 --> 03:01:23.913
Which I'm going to give them.

1531
03:01:24.664 --> 03:01:26.416
That's all I want.

1532
03:01:27.500 --> 03:01:30.378
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

1533
03:01:30.628 --> 03:01:34.883
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

1534
03:01:35.174 --> 03:01:38.344
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.

1535
03:01:38.553 --> 03:01:40.930
Tell the politicians
to burn their paper now.

1536
03:01:41.180 --> 03:01:42.515
Fair enough.

1537
03:01:43.016 --> 03:01:45.894
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

1538
03:01:46.644 --> 03:01:48.563
It's going to happen.

1539
03:01:49.230 --> 03:01:51.357
I shall want quite a lot of money.

1540
03:01:52.066 --> 03:01:53.735
All there is.

1541
03:01:54.235 --> 03:01:55.862
Not that much.

1542
03:01:59.157 --> 03:02:01.910
The best of them
won't come for money.

1543
03:02:03.786 --> 03:02:05.204
They'll come for me.

1544
03:02:23.681 --> 03:02:24.933
No pictures!

1545
03:02:25.224 --> 03:02:27.560
It's not for you, it's for Major Lawrence.

1546
03:02:27.769 --> 03:02:31.940
He doesn't mind having his picture
taken. He doesn't mind at all.

1547
03:02:32.190 --> 03:02:34.442
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

1548
03:02:38.905 --> 03:02:41.491
Have you met Major Lawrence
since he's come back?

1549
03:02:41.783 --> 03:02:43.076
Yes.

1550
03:02:43.242 --> 03:02:45.620
- Changed, hasn't he?
- No.

1551
03:02:45.787 --> 03:02:48.706
Oh, I'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.

1552
03:02:53.461 --> 03:02:57.131
What did that Turkish general
do to him in Deraa?

1553
03:02:57.840 --> 03:03:02.637
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.

1554
03:03:04.305 --> 03:03:06.849
What did the English general
do to him in Jerusalem?

1555
03:03:07.141 --> 03:03:08.810
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

1556
03:03:09.018 --> 03:03:10.979
- I did.
- What did he say?

1557
03:03:11.229 --> 03:03:12.814
He laughed.

1558
03:03:13.314 --> 03:03:15.942
He told me to gather the Harith here.

1559
03:03:16.484 --> 03:03:18.027
He offered me money.

1560
03:03:18.319 --> 03:03:19.862
Did you take it?

1561
03:03:20.655 --> 03:03:23.282
No. But many did.

1562
03:04:01.029 --> 03:04:04.073
- What is this?
- This is my bodyguard.

1563
03:04:04.782 --> 03:04:07.410
There is not a man
without a price on his head.

1564
03:04:07.702 --> 03:04:11.330
- There's a price on my head too.
- But these are murderers.

1565
03:04:11.539 --> 03:04:13.541
The sheiks will hang these men.

1566
03:04:13.791 --> 03:04:15.543
These men are mine.

1567
03:04:16.044 --> 03:04:20.381
Lawrence, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.

1568
03:04:20.715 --> 03:04:24.177
- You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
- Sherif?

1569
03:04:24.385 --> 03:04:27.388
- Where do we ride?
- Damascus, sherif.

1570
03:04:27.597 --> 03:04:29.515
Aye, but for what?

1571
03:04:29.724 --> 03:04:31.893
Sherif, for Lawrence.

1572
03:04:35.021 --> 03:04:38.357
- You have bought these things.
- I bought half the men here, Ali.

1573
03:04:38.566 --> 03:04:41.360
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.

1574
03:04:41.569 --> 03:04:44.572
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!

1575
03:04:48.576 --> 03:04:50.411
Damascus!

1576
03:04:50.620 --> 03:04:52.747
Damascus! Damascus!

1577
03:04:52.955 --> 03:04:56.042
Damascus! Damascus!

1578
03:05:29.909 --> 03:05:33.454
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's
gone through Mazril and Deraa.

1579
03:05:33.746 --> 03:05:37.375
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.

1580
03:05:37.583 --> 03:05:41.254
If the enemy's retreating in
any order, which we'll assume--

1581
03:05:41.420 --> 03:05:42.463
Certainly.

1582
03:05:42.630 --> 03:05:44.382
He can't be far from Mallud...

1583
03:05:45.007 --> 03:05:49.303
...in which case I can have him
within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

1584
03:05:49.595 --> 03:05:51.597
Splendid. Philip.

1585
03:05:51.973 --> 03:05:54.642
These are the last infantry supports
going up now.

1586
03:05:54.934 --> 03:05:58.479
But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

1587
03:05:59.147 --> 03:06:02.608
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.

1588
03:06:02.775 --> 03:06:04.026
Any questions?

1589
03:06:04.485 --> 03:06:08.614
This Arab army on the right, sir,
what's it consist of?

1590
03:06:09.115 --> 03:06:11.325
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.

1591
03:06:11.492 --> 03:06:13.411
Where are they now?

1592
03:06:14.120 --> 03:06:19.000
- Can only know by being with them.
- Then get with them. I want to know.

1593
03:06:19.333 --> 03:06:21.627
Pound them, Charley.

1594
03:06:22.211 --> 03:06:23.629
Pound them.

1595
03:06:34.182 --> 03:06:37.018
God help the men who lie under that.

1596
03:06:37.226 --> 03:06:38.853
They're Turks.

1597
03:06:39.061 --> 03:06:40.730
God help them.

1598
03:07:23.481 --> 03:07:27.235
Well, he's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1599
03:07:27.485 --> 03:07:28.778
Cocky?

1600
03:07:28.986 --> 03:07:30.738
More than cocky, sir.

1601
03:07:31.030 --> 03:07:34.367
He's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1602
03:07:34.575 --> 03:07:38.079
I tell you, sir, I think
he'll get to Damascus before we do.

1603
03:07:38.746 --> 03:07:40.581
- Unless...
- Unless?

1604
03:07:40.748 --> 03:07:44.627
Well, there's a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.

1605
03:07:44.919 --> 03:07:47.880
- What do the Turks have in Mazril?
- A brigade, sir.

1606
03:07:50.883 --> 03:07:53.094
I wonder where they are now.

1607
03:09:35.154 --> 03:09:36.322
No prisoners.

1608
03:09:39.825 --> 03:09:41.911
Damascus, Lawrence.

1609
03:09:51.837 --> 03:09:54.673
Lawrence, not this.

1610
03:09:55.383 --> 03:09:59.387
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

1611
03:10:00.137 --> 03:10:01.722
No prisoners.

1612
03:10:11.857 --> 03:10:13.442
This was Talaal's village.

1613
03:10:17.696 --> 03:10:19.698
Talaal!

1614
03:10:29.708 --> 03:10:30.918
Talaal!

1615
03:10:39.969 --> 03:10:41.971
No prisoners!

1616
03:10:42.430 --> 03:10:43.556
No prisoners!

1617
03:10:55.443 --> 03:10:56.735
God.

1618
03:11:00.489 --> 03:11:01.824
God.

1619
03:11:03.742 --> 03:11:05.119
God!

1620
03:13:22.423 --> 03:13:25.593
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!

1621
03:15:02.981 --> 03:15:04.191
Major!

1622
03:15:04.858 --> 03:15:06.527
Major Lawrence!

1623
03:15:12.199 --> 03:15:13.826
Jesus wept.

1624
03:15:29.383 --> 03:15:30.676
Jesus wept.

1625
03:15:32.553 --> 03:15:34.596
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

1626
03:15:35.222 --> 03:15:38.016
Surely you know
the Arabs are a barbarous people.

1627
03:15:38.225 --> 03:15:40.060
Barbarous and cruel.

1628
03:15:40.894 --> 03:15:42.771
Who but they?

1629
03:15:43.188 --> 03:15:44.523
Who but they?

1630
03:15:46.859 --> 03:15:49.236
Oh, you rotten man.

1631
03:15:50.279 --> 03:15:54.700
Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.

1632
03:15:56.785 --> 03:15:58.912
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

1633
03:16:25.397 --> 03:16:28.901
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.

1634
03:16:29.318 --> 03:16:31.028
Damascus!

1635
03:16:31.236 --> 03:16:33.113
Take them to Sherif Ali.

1636
03:16:33.322 --> 03:16:34.740
Tell him.

1637
03:16:35.741 --> 03:16:37.451
Remind him.

1638
03:16:38.285 --> 03:16:41.413
- Is Allenby in Damascus?
- Neat

1639
03:16:42.247 --> 03:16:44.541
Tell Sherif Ali that.

1640
03:16:45.793 --> 03:16:47.628
They are not ripe.

1641
03:16:53.592 --> 03:16:55.636
General salute!

1642
03:16:55.803 --> 03:17:00.516
Present arms!

1643
03:17:12.444 --> 03:17:14.321
Port arms!

1644
03:17:17.115 --> 03:17:18.992
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

1645
03:17:19.201 --> 03:17:22.079
The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.

1646
03:17:28.377 --> 03:17:30.170
- When?
- A day and a night, sir.

1647
03:17:30.379 --> 03:17:32.297
They've been here a day and a night.

1648
03:17:32.506 --> 03:17:35.008
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.

1649
03:17:35.300 --> 03:17:39.179
He's set up his own headquarters
in the town hall.

1650
03:17:40.097 --> 03:17:41.890
What else beside the town hall?

1651
03:17:42.182 --> 03:17:45.018
Telephone exchange,
post office, powerhouse...

1652
03:17:45.310 --> 03:17:47.688
“hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.

1653
03:17:47.896 --> 03:17:50.858
They call themselves
the Arab National Council...

1654
03:17:51.024 --> 03:17:52.693
...and they're in the town hall.

1655
03:17:52.985 --> 03:17:55.863
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.

1656
03:17:57.531 --> 03:17:59.032
What should we do about it?

1657
03:17:59.241 --> 03:18:01.660
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

1658
03:18:02.536 --> 03:18:04.371
How about that, Dryden?

1659
03:18:06.164 --> 03:18:08.876
Not unless you want
a full-scale rising.

1660
03:18:09.668 --> 03:18:12.713
- What, then?
- When will Feisal be in Damascus?

1661
03:18:12.880 --> 03:18:14.923
By special train in two days' time.

1662
03:18:15.215 --> 03:18:16.508
Two days.

1663
03:18:16.675 --> 03:18:20.053
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.

1664
03:18:20.345 --> 03:18:22.389
-Isn't it enough?
- Yes.

1665
03:18:22.556 --> 03:18:26.018
- Ample, I should think.
- We can't just do nothing.

1666
03:18:26.226 --> 03:18:29.897
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.

1667
03:18:30.147 --> 03:18:34.401
And Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.

1668
03:18:34.776 --> 03:18:36.403
Does that apply to technical units?

1669
03:18:36.695 --> 03:18:38.780
Technical units particularly.

1670
03:18:39.072 --> 03:18:40.407
Yes, sir.

1671
03:18:40.949 --> 03:18:42.409
Medicals too, sir?

1672
03:18:42.659 --> 03:18:44.870
I'm afraid so, Harry.

1673
03:18:45.203 --> 03:18:46.914
Medicals too.

1674
03:19:27.287 --> 03:19:28.830
We here...

1675
03:19:29.081 --> 03:19:31.959
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

1676
03:19:32.125 --> 03:19:35.295
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

1677
03:19:35.629 --> 03:19:39.091
...of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.

1678
03:19:39.299 --> 03:19:41.343
He insulted me.

1679
03:19:42.469 --> 03:19:46.598
Sherif Ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat...

1680
03:19:46.807 --> 03:19:49.643
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.

1681
03:19:50.143 --> 03:19:53.855
They will not work because
they are given no electricity.

1682
03:19:54.106 --> 03:19:57.651
The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.

1683
03:20:00.112 --> 03:20:02.447
If you answer,
there will be bloodshed.

1684
03:20:03.323 --> 03:20:06.827
You speak to me of bloodshed?

1685
03:20:09.538 --> 03:20:13.500
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

1686
03:20:13.750 --> 03:20:15.293
Humbly?

1687
03:20:15.460 --> 03:20:16.837
Humbly, Harith?

1688
03:20:17.129 --> 03:20:19.131
Yes, humbly.

1689
03:20:19.506 --> 03:20:21.633
This is a new trick.

1690
03:20:22.634 --> 03:20:24.302
Why is there no electricity?

1691
03:20:25.262 --> 03:20:28.015
I have been to that
electrical house, Lawrence.

1692
03:20:28.265 --> 03:20:31.143
There are three large machines.

1693
03:20:31.351 --> 03:20:33.687
He means generators!

1694
03:20:34.187 --> 03:20:35.355
So.

1695
03:20:35.814 --> 03:20:37.524
One of them is burning.

1696
03:20:37.774 --> 03:20:40.861
They are of an incredible size,
but helpless.

1697
03:20:41.194 --> 03:20:43.905
It is so of all machines.

1698
03:20:44.156 --> 03:20:48.160
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?

1699
03:20:50.829 --> 03:20:53.999
- The need is absolute.
- Then we need English engineers.

1700
03:20:54.207 --> 03:20:57.878
No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.

1701
03:20:58.170 --> 03:20:59.379
Take--

1702
03:21:03.508 --> 03:21:04.718
Fire has broken out.

1703
03:21:04.926 --> 03:21:06.511
- Where?
- The Jinsibi district.

1704
03:21:06.720 --> 03:21:09.598
- It is not a district that matters.
- It will spread!

1705
03:21:09.890 --> 03:21:11.558
Then use the fire brigade!

1706
03:21:11.850 --> 03:21:14.728
We have tried,
but there is no force in the water.

1707
03:21:14.936 --> 03:21:16.438
Then you must carry it.

1708
03:21:16.730 --> 03:21:21.068
- The Ruala do not carry water.
- What else are they good for?

1709
03:21:33.371 --> 03:21:36.917
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

1710
03:21:39.753 --> 03:21:41.463
This afternoon!

1711
03:22:05.237 --> 03:22:09.241
- I'll take this up after the war.
- Surely we should do something, sir.

1712
03:22:09.449 --> 03:22:13.411
- It's an old man's sport.
- Are you an old man, sir?

1713
03:22:13.620 --> 03:22:16.498
All I can say is, sir,
it's a heavy responsibility.

1714
03:22:17.958 --> 03:22:19.292
Sorry, sir.

1715
03:22:21.503 --> 03:22:23.171
Maybe it's the bulb.

1716
03:22:27.884 --> 03:22:29.010
No, sir.

1717
03:22:29.469 --> 03:22:31.138
It's the power.

1718
03:22:46.319 --> 03:22:47.696
They're leaving.

1719
03:22:48.405 --> 03:22:50.115
That's it, then.

1720
03:22:50.615 --> 03:22:52.701
Marvellous-looking beggars,
aren't they?

1721
03:23:13.930 --> 03:23:16.808
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

1722
03:23:17.058 --> 03:23:19.060
- Come where?
- Back.

1723
03:23:23.523 --> 03:23:25.734
I know your heart.

1724
03:23:34.201 --> 03:23:35.827
What is it?

1725
03:23:36.828 --> 03:23:38.496
Is it this?

1726
03:23:41.208 --> 03:23:44.336
I tell you, this is nothing.

1727
03:23:57.515 --> 03:23:59.184
Is it the blood?

1728
03:23:59.976 --> 03:24:03.063
The desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of.

1729
03:24:04.606 --> 03:24:08.985
I pray that I may never
see the desert again.

1730
03:24:10.070 --> 03:24:11.363
Hear me, God.

1731
03:24:13.073 --> 03:24:16.910
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.

1732
03:24:33.760 --> 03:24:35.053
What about you?

1733
03:24:36.054 --> 03:24:39.641
No, I shall stay here
and learn politics.

1734
03:24:42.143 --> 03:24:43.561
A very low occupation.

1735
03:24:44.062 --> 03:24:47.107
I had not thought of it
when I met you.

1736
03:24:56.074 --> 03:24:58.952
You have tried very hard
to give us Damascus.

1737
03:24:59.160 --> 03:25:01.079
It's what I came for.

1738
03:25:04.582 --> 03:25:05.834
And then...

1739
03:25:08.253 --> 03:25:09.629
...it would be something.

1740
03:25:09.838 --> 03:25:11.089
Yes.

1741
03:25:11.756 --> 03:25:12.966
Much.

1742
03:25:31.985 --> 03:25:34.446
- He is your friend?
- Take your hand away.

1743
03:25:34.654 --> 03:25:35.947
- You love him.
- I fear him.

1744
03:25:36.156 --> 03:25:37.991
Then why do you weep?

1745
03:25:38.325 --> 03:25:40.493
If I fear him, who love him...

1746
03:25:40.660 --> 03:25:43.621
...how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?

1747
03:25:43.997 --> 03:25:47.125
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

1748
03:25:49.502 --> 03:25:52.839
So you are not yet entirely politician.

1749
03:25:53.006 --> 03:25:54.090
Not yet.

1750
03:25:54.341 --> 03:25:58.678
Well, these are new tricks,
and I am an old dog.

1751
03:25:59.220 --> 03:26:01.139
And Allah be thanked.

1752
03:26:01.639 --> 03:26:03.016
I'll tell thee what...

1753
03:26:03.308 --> 03:26:06.644
...being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.

1754
03:26:28.124 --> 03:26:31.419
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.

1755
03:26:31.711 --> 03:26:34.547
It comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.

1756
03:26:34.756 --> 03:26:39.135
Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.

1757
03:26:39.386 --> 03:26:42.389
Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.

1758
03:26:42.680 --> 03:26:44.224
No, sir, I will not.

1759
03:26:45.183 --> 03:26:46.768
Control yourself.

1760
03:26:47.268 --> 03:26:50.397
Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.

1761
03:26:51.356 --> 03:26:53.650
We did what we could
in the civic hospitals.

1762
03:26:53.858 --> 03:26:56.694
But you forgot
the Turkish Military Hospital.

1763
03:26:57.070 --> 03:27:01.533
It has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

1764
03:27:02.200 --> 03:27:06.788
All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.

1765
03:27:13.545 --> 03:27:14.963
What's it like?

1766
03:28:31.831 --> 03:28:33.875
This is outrageous!

1767
03:28:35.001 --> 03:28:36.878
Outrageous!

1768
03:28:40.131 --> 03:28:41.841
Outrageous!

1769
03:28:42.967 --> 03:28:45.178
You filthy little wog!

1770
03:28:55.688 --> 03:28:59.776
My friend Lawrence,
if I may call him that.

1771
03:29:00.026 --> 03:29:02.487
"My friend Lawrence."

1772
03:29:02.695 --> 03:29:07.325
How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.

1773
03:29:07.534 --> 03:29:10.203
He longs for the greenness
of his native land.

1774
03:29:10.411 --> 03:29:15.542
He pines for the Gothic cottages
of Surrey, is it not?

1775
03:29:15.792 --> 03:29:19.379
Already in imagination,
he catches trout...

1776
03:29:19.671 --> 03:29:23.174
...and all the activities
of the English gentleman.

1777
03:29:23.383 --> 03:29:26.886
That's me you're describing, sir,
not Colonel Lawrence.

1778
03:29:27.804 --> 03:29:30.014
You're promoted colonel.

1779
03:29:30.223 --> 03:29:32.684
Yes. What for?

1780
03:29:32.892 --> 03:29:36.062
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.

1781
03:29:36.312 --> 03:29:40.400
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home.

1782
03:29:41.025 --> 03:29:43.319
Then, thank you.

1783
03:29:47.532 --> 03:29:48.741
Well, then...

1784
03:29:49.367 --> 03:29:50.410
...Godspeed.

1785
03:29:50.910 --> 03:29:54.831
There's nothing further here
for a warrior.

1786
03:29:55.081 --> 03:29:59.210
We drive bargains. Old men's work.

1787
03:29:59.419 --> 03:30:01.754
Young men make wars,
and the virtues of war...

1788
03:30:01.921 --> 03:30:03.840
...are the virtues of young men.

1789
03:30:04.090 --> 03:30:07.552
Courage and hope for the future.

1790
03:30:07.760 --> 03:30:10.430
Then old men make the peace.

1791
03:30:11.556 --> 03:30:14.434
And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.

1792
03:30:14.642 --> 03:30:17.103
Mistrust and caution.

1793
03:30:18.062 --> 03:30:19.897
It must be so.

1794
03:30:36.289 --> 03:30:40.918
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.

1795
03:30:50.637 --> 03:30:54.307
The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these I concede.

1796
03:30:54.599 --> 03:30:56.309
The pumping plant I must retain.

1797
03:30:56.517 --> 03:30:59.103
If you retain it,
there will be no water.

1798
03:30:59.312 --> 03:31:03.024
- I shall be glad of assistance.
- Then you must bring down your flag.

1799
03:31:03.316 --> 03:31:07.153
I shall not, and if your men
attempt it, my men will resist it.

1800
03:31:07.445 --> 03:31:09.113
- Have you men?
- Enough for that.

1801
03:31:09.322 --> 03:31:11.699
It's a thing that
makes an ugly incident.

1802
03:31:12.033 --> 03:31:13.910
I'm sure your government...

1803
03:31:14.160 --> 03:31:17.997
...does not wish to appear at the peace
conference as an aggressor.

1804
03:31:20.291 --> 03:31:21.793
L say!

1805
03:31:23.169 --> 03:31:25.129
It's Lawrence, isn't it?

1806
03:31:27.465 --> 03:31:29.676
May I shake your hand, sir?

1807
03:31:30.843 --> 03:31:33.471
Just want to be able
to say I'd done it, sir.

1808
03:31:37.058 --> 03:31:39.310
Haven't we met before?

1809
03:31:39.519 --> 03:31:41.145
Don't think so, sir.

1810
03:31:41.354 --> 03:31:44.065
No, no, sir, I should remember that.

1811
03:31:49.320 --> 03:31:53.491
It is widely known the Arab Council
took power in my name.

1812
03:31:53.700 --> 03:31:55.702
They have no power. It's illusory.

1813
03:31:55.952 --> 03:31:58.371
Illusions can be very powerful.

1814
03:31:58.746 --> 03:32:00.373
Particularly...

1815
03:32:01.249 --> 03:32:03.876
...when they take this form.

1816
03:32:06.045 --> 03:32:09.048
The world is delighted
at the picture of Damascus...

1817
03:32:09.257 --> 03:32:11.217
...liberated by the Arab army.

1818
03:32:11.759 --> 03:32:14.846
Led, may I remind you,
by a British-serving officer.

1819
03:32:15.388 --> 03:32:20.393
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence
is a sword with two edges.

1820
03:32:20.685 --> 03:32:23.730
We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?

1821
03:32:27.358 --> 03:32:29.569
I thought I was a hard man, sir.

1822
03:32:30.403 --> 03:32:32.697
You are merely a general.

1823
03:32:35.241 --> 03:32:36.743
I must be a king.

1824
03:32:39.746 --> 03:32:41.622
Excuse me, sir.

1825
03:32:56.262 --> 03:32:57.555
Well?

1826
03:32:58.431 --> 03:32:59.807
Well...

1827
03:33:00.266 --> 03:33:03.144
...it seems we're to have
a British waterworks...

1828
03:33:03.394 --> 03:33:05.605
...with an Arab flag on it.

1829
03:33:05.813 --> 03:33:07.774
Do you think it was worth it?

1830
03:33:07.940 --> 03:33:10.610
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.

1831
03:33:10.943 --> 03:33:12.111
Yes, sir.

1832
03:33:12.403 --> 03:33:14.030
So you keep saying.

1833
03:33:14.238 --> 03:33:15.823
You, I suspect...

1834
03:33:16.324 --> 03:33:20.244
...are chief architect
of this compromise.

1835
03:33:20.661 --> 03:33:23.790
- What do you think?
- Me, Your Highness?

1836
03:33:24.457 --> 03:33:28.753
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

1837
03:34:06.791 --> 03:34:09.836
Well, sir. Going home.

1838
03:34:12.171 --> 03:34:13.840
Home, sir.
