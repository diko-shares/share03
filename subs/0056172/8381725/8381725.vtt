Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.

No, no. I didn't know

And to make him
known to the world.

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:43.492
He was a poet, a scholar

Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

107
00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:51.550
If they rise against the Turks, does the bureau think
they're going to sit down under us when this war is over?

108
00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:56.430
The bureau thinks the job of the moment, sir,
is to win the war.

Well, you're not doing much good here, sir.

I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

00:41:12.304 --> 00:41:14.264
You could supply us through Aqaba.

Well, if you can get ahold of Aqaba, sir,
of course we can supply you.

-But you can't.
-You could.

You mean the navy?

393
00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:29.237
The Turks have 12-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.

394
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:31.489
Can you imagine
what that means?

395
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.491
Yes, I can imagine.

396
00:41:33.658 --> 00:41:37.913
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.

Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

398
00:41:41.374 --> 00:41:45.086
The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.

399
00:41:45.253 --> 00:41:47.130
You can see that, sir, surely.

400
00:41:47.297 --> 00:41:50.300
I see that the canal
is an essential British interest.

401
00:41:50.467 --> 00:41:52.510
It is of little consequence to us.

to Damascus, sir, but discipline will.

00:43:03.957 --> 00:43:09.004
Look, sir, Great Britain is a small country,
it's much smaller than yours.

426
00:43:09.254 --> 00:43:11.589
Small population
compared with some.

427
00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:15.218
It's small, but it's great. And why?

428
00:43:15.302 --> 00:43:18.013
-Because it has guns.
-Because it has discipline.

429
00:43:18.263 --> 00:43:22.434
Because it has a navy.
Because of this, the English go where they please

430
00:43:22.684 --> 00:43:25.270
and strike where they please.
And this makes them great.

431
00:43:25.562 --> 00:43:27.647
-Right.
-Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

432
00:43:27.897 --> 00:43:30.150

is not your military adviser.

I think your book is right.

439
00:43:52.547 --> 00:43:56.968
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.

And on this ocean, the Bedu

441
00:44:01.181 --> 00:44:03.433
This is the way the Bedu has always fought.

442
00:44:03.683 --> 00:44:06.603
You're famed throughout the world
for fighting in this way.

443

And this is the way
you should fight now.

446
00:44:13.943 --> 00:44:17.781
Fall back on Yenbo, sir, and the Arab Rising
becomes one poor unit in the British army.

The sooner the better.

In effect, my lord, yes.

And I must do it,

461
00:45:22.762 --> 00:45:26.516
because the Turks
have European guns.

00:45:26.766 --> 00:45:29.436
But I fear to do it...

hunger for desolate places.

That's right.

02:04:27.377 --> 02:04:28.712
They're coming through Beersheba.

1068
02:04:28.879 --> 02:04:31.631
I know, but we've gone forward
to Gaza.

1069
02:04:31.798 --> 02:04:36.386
-So?
-So that left Aqaba behind your right.

1070
02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:38.054
True.

1071
02:04:38.221 --> 02:04:42.851
And it will be further behind your right
when you go for Jerusalem.

1072
02:04:43.727 --> 02:04:46.146
Am I going for Jerusalem?

1073
02:04:46.313 --> 02:04:47.647
Yes.

1074
02:04:49.983 --> 02:04:51.401
Very well.

1075
02:04:51.651 --> 02:04:53.904
Aqaba behind my right.

1076
02:04:54.154 --> 02:04:57.032
It threatened El‘ ArTsh and Gaza.

1077
02:04:58.450 --> 02:04:59.826
Anything else?

1078
02:04:59.993 --> 02:05:01.328
Yes.

1079
02:05:01.494 --> 02:05:03.914
Aqaba's linked with Medina.

1080
02:05:04.456 --> 02:05:07.500
Do you think we should shift them
out of Medina now?

1081
02:05:07.751 --> 02:05:11.338
No. I think you should leave them there.

1082
02:05:11.504 --> 02:05:13.506
You acted without orders, you know.

1083
02:05:14.216 --> 02:05:18.470
Shouldn't officers use
their initiative at all times?

1084
02:05:18.637 --> 02:05:21.056
Not really. It's awfully dangerous, Lawrence.

1085
02:05:21.223 --> 02:05:23.558
Yes, I know.

1086
02:05:23.808 --> 02:05:25.352
Already?

1087
02:05:25.518 --> 02:05:26.853
Yes.

1088
02:05:28.605 --> 02:05:31.233
I'm promoting you major.

1089
02:05:32.234 --> 02:05:34.527
I don't think that's a very good idea.

1090
02:05:34.694 --> 02:05:37.822
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back

1091
02:05:37.989 --> 02:05:41.660
and carry on the good work.

1092
02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:44.996
No. Thank you, sir.

1093
02:05:45.497 --> 02:05:49.501
-Why not?
-We||, I, it's...

1094
02:05:49.668 --> 02:05:51.044
Let me see now...

1095
02:05:52.754 --> 02:05:56.508
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.

1096
02:05:56.675 --> 02:05:58.969
One was a boy.

1097
02:05:59.135 --> 02:06:00.595
That was...

1098
02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:04.099
yesterday.

1099
02:06:04.266 --> 02:06:06.309
I led him into a quicksand.

1100
02:06:06.559 --> 02:06:08.228
The other was a man.

1101
02:06:08.561 --> 02:06:10.522
That was...

1102
02:06:10.689 --> 02:06:13.149
before Aqaba, anyway.

1103
02:06:13.817 --> 02:06:16.486
I had to execute him
with my pistol.

1104
02:06:16.987 --> 02:06:20.073
There was something about it
I didn't like.

1105
02:06:20.323 --> 02:06:23.451
-Well, naturally.
-No. Something else.

1106
02:06:25.704 --> 02:06:28.123
I see. Well, that's all right.
Let it be a warning.

1107
02:06:28.290 --> 02:06:30.375
No. Something else.

1108
02:06:32.002 --> 02:06:33.628
What, then?

1109
02:06:34.504 --> 02:06:36.881
I enjoyed it.

1110
02:06:44.389 --> 02:06:47.934
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.

1111
02:06:49.686 --> 02:06:53.356
What do you mean by coming here
dressed like that? Amateur theatricals?

1112
02:06:53.523 --> 02:06:55.233
Oh, yes. Entirely.

1113
02:06:55.483 --> 02:06:58.611
Let me see that hat thing,
or whatever it is.

1114
02:06:58.903 --> 02:07:00.947
Fascinating gear they wear.

1115
02:07:01.197 --> 02:07:03.491
How do you think
I would look in this, Harry?

1116
02:07:03.658 --> 02:07:07.162
-Damn ridiculous, sir.
-Here, you keep it.

1117
02:07:08.038 --> 02:07:12.208
What I'm trying to say is,
I don't think I'm fit for it.

1118
02:07:12.375 --> 02:07:15.253
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

1119
02:07:16.296 --> 02:07:20.884
Before he did it, sir,
I'd have said it couldn't be done.

1120
02:07:21.217 --> 02:07:24.220
-Brighton?
-I know what he thinks.

1121
02:07:25.388 --> 02:07:28.725
I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

1122
02:07:29.059 --> 02:07:32.020
I don't think it matters
what his motives were.

1123
02:07:32.187 --> 02:07:35.315
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

1124
02:07:36.858 --> 02:07:38.777
ALLENBY: Mr. Perkins!
PERKINS: Sir!

1125
02:07:38.943 --> 02:07:41.571
ALLENBY: Let's have
a drink, gentlemen.

1126
02:07:45.617 --> 02:07:49.079
-You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
-Yes, sir.

1127
02:07:49.245 --> 02:07:53.583
-What do you think about it?
-Bloody marvelous, sir. Well done, sir.

1128
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:56.795
-Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
-Sir!

1129
02:07:57.295 --> 02:08:00.131
[fir]

1130
02:08:02.509 --> 02:08:04.094
Come on, then.

1131
02:08:07.722 --> 02:08:09.516
You're a clever man, sir.

1132
02:08:09.808 --> 02:08:13.436
No, but I know a good thing
when I see one.

1133
02:08:13.686 --> 02:08:16.398
That's fair, surely.

1134
02:08:36.918 --> 02:08:42.006
Look here, now. If I am going to break through
to Jerusalem, I must concentrate, not dissipate.

1135
02:08:42.257 --> 02:08:44.551
-Clausewitz.
-You know better?

1136
02:09:04.112 --> 02:09:06.990
I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

1137
02:09:07.157 --> 02:09:09.576
We should do very well indeed,
shouldn't we?

1138
02:09:46.154 --> 02:09:48.573
Easy, gentlemen, please.

1139
02:09:49.782 --> 02:09:51.993
-Will you give us something to drink?
-Of course, sir.

1140
02:09:52.494 --> 02:09:56.080
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

1141
02:09:56.706 --> 02:09:58.041
Tracy.

1142
02:09:59.918 --> 02:10:01.794
Shall we go outside?

1143
02:10:12.931 --> 02:10:16.059
ALLENBY: So you hold bound
the Turkish desert army?

1144
02:10:16.226 --> 02:10:17.560
LAWRENCE:
Yes.

1145
02:10:17.727 --> 02:10:20.063
With 1000 Arabs?

1146
02:10:21.147 --> 02:10:24.317
1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.

1147
02:10:24.484 --> 02:10:26.486
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

1148
02:10:27.028 --> 02:10:28.696
It means 1000 camels.

1149
02:10:28.988 --> 02:10:33.243
That means 1000 packs
of high explosives and 1000 crack rifles.

1150
02:10:33.785 --> 02:10:37.580
We can cross Arabia while Johnny Turk
is still turning round.

1151
02:10:38.164 --> 02:10:40.124
I'll smash his railways.

1152
02:10:40.291 --> 02:10:42.835
And while he's mending them,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

1153
02:10:43.086 --> 02:10:45.880
In 13 weeks I can have Arabia in chaos.

1154
02:10:46.130 --> 02:10:48.508
You are going back, then?

1155
02:10:51.261 --> 02:10:52.595
Yes.

1156
02:10:52.971 --> 02:10:55.306
Of course I'm going back.

1157
02:10:59.644 --> 02:11:02.105
Hm. Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.

1158
02:11:02.355 --> 02:11:06.526
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits,

1159
02:11:06.693 --> 02:11:08.027
he'll withdraw.

1160
02:11:08.194 --> 02:11:10.989
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

1161
02:11:11.155 --> 02:11:13.700
If he gets out now, he knows
he'll never get back again.

1162
02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:16.452
-I wonder who will.
-No one will.

1163
02:11:17.078 --> 02:11:19.289
LAWRENCE:
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

1164
02:11:25.295 --> 02:11:27.630
That's what I've told them anyway.

1165
02:11:28.089 --> 02:11:29.924
That's what they think.

1166
02:11:30.383 --> 02:11:33.636
-That's why they're fighting.
-Oh, surely.

1167
02:11:36.598 --> 02:11:38.891
They've only one suspicion.

1168
02:11:39.309 --> 02:11:43.688
That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

1169
02:11:43.938 --> 02:11:48.276
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1170
02:11:48.443 --> 02:11:49.777
Have we?

1171
02:11:49.944 --> 02:11:52.447
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1172
02:11:52.614 --> 02:11:55.742
Have we any ambition in Arabia, Dryden?

1173
02:11:56.701 --> 02:11:58.995
Difficult question, sir.

1174
02:12:00.997 --> 02:12:04.834
I want to know, sir,
if I can tell them in your name

1175
02:12:05.001 --> 02:12:08.379
that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

1176
02:12:09.464 --> 02:12:10.965
Certainly.

1177
02:12:12.467 --> 02:12:14.886
[BUGLE SOUNDS]

1178
02:12:28.483 --> 02:12:31.819
2000 small arms, not enough. I need five.

1179
02:12:31.986 --> 02:12:33.321
Right.

1180
02:12:33.571 --> 02:12:36.282
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.

1181
02:12:36.908 --> 02:12:37.867
Right.

1182
02:12:37.950 --> 02:12:41.371
-|nstructors for the Lewis guns.
-Right.

1183
02:12:41.537 --> 02:12:43.122
More money.

1184
02:12:43.414 --> 02:12:46.668
-How much more?
-25,000 now. A lot more later.

1185
02:12:46.834 --> 02:12:49.587
-Dryden?
-It can be done, sir.

1186
02:12:49.754 --> 02:12:52.632
A couple of armored cars.

1187
02:12:52.799 --> 02:12:54.175
Right.

1188
02:12:54.884 --> 02:12:56.469
Field artillery.

1189
02:12:58.638 --> 02:13:00.014
Right.

1190
02:13:02.934 --> 02:13:05.269
I'm going to give you every blessed thing
I can, Major Lawrence,

1191
02:13:05.436 --> 02:13:08.398
because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations and thank you.

1192
02:13:08.564 --> 02:13:11.275
Thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen.

1193
02:13:20.076 --> 02:13:21.911
[fir]

1194
02:13:46.936 --> 02:13:48.813
Congratulations!

1195
02:13:59.115 --> 02:14:02.243
Are you really going to give them artillery, sir?

1196
02:14:02.410 --> 02:14:04.287
I was wondering that, sir.

1197
02:14:04.454 --> 02:14:06.664
Might be deuced difficult
to get it back again.

1198
02:14:06.914 --> 02:14:10.501
Give them artillery
and you've made them independent.

1199
02:14:10.668 --> 02:14:12.628
Then I can't give them artillery, can I?

1200
02:14:12.879 --> 02:14:14.797
-For you to say, sir.
-No, it's not.

1201
02:14:15.047 --> 02:14:17.842
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

1202
02:14:18.009 --> 02:14:19.969
Not like that poor devil.

1203
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:22.096
He's riding the whirlwind.

1204
02:14:22.263 --> 02:14:24.474
Let's hope we're not.

1205
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:33.816
[fir]

1206
02:15:17.424 --> 02:15:20.635
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?

1207
02:15:21.136 --> 02:15:22.470
To Prince Feisal.

1208
02:15:22.637 --> 02:15:24.472
You're not Prince Feisal
by any chance?

1209
02:15:24.639 --> 02:15:27.058
-No.
-You know him though?

1210
02:15:27.225 --> 02:15:30.687
He is my master.
I am his servant.

1211
02:15:32.731 --> 02:15:35.191
Um, can you read?

1212
02:15:43.867 --> 02:15:48.580
The Chicago Courier is my own particular paper,
but my work is syndicated throughout America.

1213
02:15:48.663 --> 02:15:52.167
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.

1214
02:16:06.181 --> 02:16:07.515
Now...

1215
02:16:08.725 --> 02:16:12.729
-Where can I find Major Lawrence?
-ls that what you have come for?

1216
02:16:12.896 --> 02:16:15.023
Not altogether, sir, no.

1217
02:16:15.315 --> 02:16:19.694
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

1218
02:16:19.861 --> 02:16:22.906
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?

1219
02:16:23.073 --> 02:16:24.407
I don't know.

1220
02:16:25.075 --> 02:16:27.744
-Last week they were near El Ghira.
-Ghira?

1221
02:16:27.994 --> 02:16:31.831
Oh, yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

1222
02:16:32.791 --> 02:16:35.377
-|'ve never tried.
-Take a mule.

1223
02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:38.046
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.

1224
02:16:38.463 --> 02:16:41.216
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

1225
02:16:41.383 --> 02:16:42.717
They do.

1226
02:16:42.884 --> 02:16:45.970
But not so fast as we do,
you will find.

1227
02:16:46.304 --> 02:16:47.764
Myself...

1228
02:16:48.390 --> 02:16:50.350
I am going to Cairo.

1229
02:16:50.558 --> 02:16:52.560
-As you know.
-Yes.

1230
02:16:52.769 --> 02:16:55.230
There's work for me there
of a different kind.

1231
02:16:55.688 --> 02:16:57.023
Yes.

1232
02:17:00.568 --> 02:17:02.946
I understand you've been given
no artillery.

1233
02:17:03.405 --> 02:17:05.990
-That is so.
-You're handicapped?

1234
02:17:06.157 --> 02:17:08.368
It restricts us to small things.

1235
02:17:08.535 --> 02:17:09.869

02:51:48.529 --> 02:51:51.532
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

1582
02:51:51.782 --> 02:51:53.701
You proved it.

1583
02:51:53.951 --> 02:51:56.120
Look, Ali. Look.

1584
02:51:56.370 --> 02:52:00.291
That's me. What color is it?
That's me.

1585
02:52:00.958 --> 02:52:03.294
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

1586
02:52:03.461 --> 02:52:06.255
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.

1587
02:52:07.882 --> 02:52:09.383
He can...

1588
02:52:09.550 --> 02:52:12.470
but he can't want what he wants.

1589
02:52:13.387 --> 02:52:16.641
This is the stuff that decides
what he wants.

1590
02:52:19.435 --> 02:52:23.231
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.

1591
02:52:23.481 --> 02:52:27.401
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.

1592
02:52:27.652 --> 02:52:30.446
-I tried to.
-So would any man.

1593
02:52:30.613 --> 02:52:34.158
Well, any man is what I am.

1594
02:52:35.159 --> 02:52:39.163
And I'm going back to Allenby
to ask him for a job

1595
02:52:39.413 --> 02:52:41.457
that any man can do.

1596
02:52:41.749 --> 02:52:43.668
A||enby's in Jerusalem.

1597
02:52:43.918 --> 02:52:46.629
<i>-|'||</i> make easy stages.
-You?

1598
02:52:48.214 --> 02:52:51.676
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1599
02:52:53.427 --> 02:52:57.974
Look, Ali, I think I see a way
of being just

1600
02:52:58.224 --> 02:52:59.809
ordinarily...

1601
02:53:00.476 --> 02:53:01.894
happy-

1602
02:53:05.731 --> 02:53:07.316
Can I take this?

1603
02:53:07.942 --> 02:53:09.860
It is not clean.

1604
02:53:10.111 --> 02:53:13.155
No, but it's warm.

1605
02:53:13.489 --> 02:53:14.824
And these...

1606
02:53:15.074 --> 02:53:18.995
having led them here,
have you no care for them?

1607
02:53:20.496 --> 02:53:25.710
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

1608
02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:30.131
And let me go back to mine.

1609
02:53:30.798 --> 02:53:33.634
[fir]

1610
02:53:59.285 --> 02:54:02.371
-I say, don't forget those form fives.
-All right.

1611
02:54:05.708 --> 02:54:07.501
Hey!

1612
02:54:08.252 --> 02:54:10.087
-Mind if I join you?
-Oh.

1613
02:54:10.921 --> 02:54:12.590
Honored, sir.

1614
02:54:14.925 --> 02:54:18.220
-Good to be back.
-We heard you were, sir.

1615
02:54:18.804 --> 02:54:21.349
-What's doing out there?
-Where?

1616
02:54:21.599 --> 02:54:23.851
-Oh, Arabia?
-We||, yes, sir.

1617
02:54:24.101 --> 02:54:27.438
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?

1618
02:54:27.688 --> 02:54:30.149
We're settling in all right, sir.
We built a squash court.

1619
02:54:30.316 --> 02:54:31.776
Jolly good.

1620
02:54:32.610 --> 02:54:36.572
Well, I have to go up there.

1621
02:54:37.573 --> 02:54:40.034
It's borrowed.
Someone pinched mine.

1622
02:54:40.284 --> 02:54:41.994
Bloody wogs.

1623
02:54:43.412 --> 02:54:45.331
Yes, probably.

1624
02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:48.417
Jolly good about the squash court.

1625
02:54:51.170 --> 02:54:53.673
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

1626
02:55:06.852 --> 02:55:08.187
Morning.

1627
02:55:08.354 --> 02:55:10.147
-Good morning, sir.
-Good to be back.

1628
02:55:10.398 --> 02:55:13.484
-I'll believe you, sir.
-No, really, it is.

1629
02:55:16.737 --> 02:55:18.072
Hello.

1630
02:55:18.698 --> 02:55:21.826
Morning. You're to go right in.

1631
02:55:33.838 --> 02:55:35.297
Lawrence.

1632
02:55:37.091 --> 02:55:39.635
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1633
02:55:40.302 --> 02:55:43.180
-Sir.
-Ah.

1634
02:55:47.476 --> 02:55:49.353
Well, general, I will leave you.

1635
02:55:49.603 --> 02:55:52.481
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make

1636
02:55:52.773 --> 02:55:56.569
about my people
and their weakness

1637
02:55:56.819 --> 02:56:01.615
and the need to keep them weak
in the British interest.

1638
02:56:04.118 --> 02:56:07.705
And the French interest too, of course.
We must not forget the French.

1639
02:56:07.872 --> 02:56:09.915
I told you, sir, no such treaty exists.

1640
02:56:10.166 --> 02:56:14.670
Yes, general, you have lied most bravely,
but not convincingly.

1641
02:56:14.837 --> 02:56:16.922
I know this treaty does exist.

1642
02:56:17.089 --> 02:56:19.049
Treaty, sir?

1643
02:56:21.218 --> 02:56:23.220
He does it better than you, general.

1644
02:56:23.471 --> 02:56:26.766
But then, of course, he is almost an Arab.

1645
02:56:40.946 --> 02:56:42.573
You really don't know?

1646
02:56:44.867 --> 02:56:46.869
Then what the devil's this?

1647
02:56:47.912 --> 02:56:51.832
It's my request
for release from Arabia, sir.

1648
02:56:51.999 --> 02:56:55.920
For what reason? Are you sure
you haven't heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1649
02:56:56.086 --> 02:56:57.463
No.

1650
02:56:58.214 --> 02:57:01.383
-I can guess.
-Don't guess. Tell him.

1651
02:57:03.177 --> 02:57:04.595
Well, now...

1652
02:57:05.012 --> 02:57:08.057
Mr. Sykes is an English civil servant.

1653
02:57:08.307 --> 02:57:11.435
Monsieur Picot is a French civil servant.

1654
02:57:11.602 --> 02:57:15.815
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war,

1655
02:57:16.065 --> 02:57:19.610
France and England
should share the Turkish Empire.

1656
02:57:19.693 --> 02:57:21.445
Including Arabia.

1657
02:57:21.695 --> 02:57:25.825
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

1658
02:57:25.991 --> 02:57:29.119
An agreement to that effect.

1659
02:57:29.745 --> 02:57:33.332
There may be honor among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

1660
02:57:33.582 --> 02:57:36.335
And let's have no displays of indignation.

1661
02:57:36.585 --> 02:57:39.713
You may not have known,
but you certainly had suspicions.

1662
02:57:40.214 --> 02:57:43.592
If we've told lies, you've told half-lies.

1663
02:57:43.759 --> 02:57:48.222
And a man who tells lies,
like me, merely hides the truth.

1664
02:57:48.472 --> 02:57:53.185
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

1665
02:57:53.769 --> 02:57:57.064
The truth is, I'm an ordinary man.

1666
02:57:57.565 --> 02:57:59.984
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1667
02:58:01.443 --> 02:58:03.445
And I want an ordinary job, sir.

1668
02:58:03.696 --> 02:58:06.031
That's my reason for resigning.

1669
02:58:06.198 --> 02:58:08.993
It's personal.

1670
02:58:09.159 --> 02:58:11.370
-Personal?
-Yes, sir.

1671
02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:14.707
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.

1672
02:58:14.957 --> 02:58:18.335
And as it happens, a damned important one.
Personal? Are you mad?

1673
02:58:18.586 --> 02:58:21.797
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

1674
02:58:22.047 --> 02:58:24.091
That's my reason too.

1675
02:58:24.258 --> 02:58:29.346
Look, Lawrence, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 16th of next month,

1676
02:58:29.513 --> 02:58:31.473
and you are part of it.

1677
02:58:31.974 --> 02:58:35.728
Can you understand that?
You're an important part of the big push!

1678
02:58:35.936 --> 02:58:39.773
I don't want to be part of your big push!

1679
02:58:40.524 --> 02:58:42.693
What about your Arab friends?
What about them?

1680
02:58:42.776 --> 02:58:46.655
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!

1681
02:58:46.822 --> 02:58:49.074
ALLENBY: What in hell
do you want, Lawrence?

1682
02:58:49.241 --> 02:58:54.371
I've told you, I just want my ration
of common humanity.

1683
02:58:54.622 --> 02:58:57.541
DRYDEN: Lawrence.
-Yes?

1684
02:59:00.252 --> 02:59:03.005
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

1685
02:59:03.255 --> 02:59:05.674
That's quite all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1686
02:59:05.758 --> 02:59:07.343
Thank you, sir.

1687
02:59:08.427 --> 02:59:10.638
Why don't we...?

1688
02:59:13.223 --> 02:59:15.059
There's blood
on your back.

1689
02:59:16.310 --> 02:59:19.438
-Do you want a doctor?
-No.

1690
02:59:20.606 --> 02:59:22.775
Tell me what happened.

1691
02:59:27.738 --> 02:59:29.865
Say, what goes on in there?

1692
02:59:30.658 --> 02:59:32.618
-Nothing.
-Oh, come on!

1693
02:59:32.785 --> 02:59:36.288
-No, really. Nothing at all.
-ls the man in trouble?

1694
02:59:36.455 --> 02:59:40.417
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

1695
02:59:40.668 --> 02:59:44.338
Just let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got an interest in that man. I've got a claim.

1696
02:59:44.505 --> 02:59:45.839
What claim?

1697
02:59:46.006 --> 02:59:48.384
You've read my stuff.
I've made that boy a hero.

1698
02:59:48.467 --> 02:59:51.178
When the war's over,
that boy can be anything he wants.

1699
02:59:51.428 --> 02:59:55.724
Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.

1700
02:59:56.225 --> 02:59:59.061
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

1701
02:59:59.645 --> 03:00:02.106
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

1702
03:00:02.356 --> 03:00:05.150
Always walking away, aren't you?

1703
03:00:05.401 --> 03:00:06.986
Well, I'll tell you.

1704
03:00:07.152 --> 03:00:10.155
It's a little clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

1705
03:00:10.322 --> 03:00:13.242
inevitably, one of them's half-mad

1706
03:00:13.492 --> 03:00:16.245
and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

1707
03:00:17.079 --> 03:00:20.124
I believe your name
will be a household word,

1708
03:00:20.624 --> 03:00:24.294
when you'd have to go to the war museum
to find who Allenby was.

1709
03:00:25.170 --> 03:00:28.048
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.

1710
03:00:28.674 --> 03:00:30.175
Leave me alone.

1711
03:00:30.426 --> 03:00:33.012
-Leave me alone.
-That's a feeble thing to say.

1712
03:00:33.178 --> 03:00:35.931
-I know I'm not ordinary.
-That's not what I'm saying.

1713
03:00:36.015 --> 03:00:38.767
All right, I'm extraordinary.

1714
03:00:40.519 --> 03:00:41.854
What of it?

1715
03:00:42.229 --> 03:00:44.982
Not many people have a destiny, Lawrence.

1716
03:00:45.149 --> 03:00:48.318
It's a terrible thing for a man
to flunk it if he has.

1717
03:00:48.485 --> 03:00:50.612
Are you speaking from experience?

1718
03:00:50.904 --> 03:00:52.281
No.

1719
03:00:52.448 --> 03:00:54.324
You're guessing, then.

1720
03:00:55.451 --> 03:00:56.827
Suppose you're wrong.

1721
03:00:57.077 --> 03:01:00.164
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

1722
03:01:00.956 --> 03:01:03.917
-Yes. I said, yes.
-After a||--

1723
03:01:06.503 --> 03:01:08.547
-The 16th?
-Can you do it?

1724
03:01:08.714 --> 03:01:10.799
I'll give you a lot of money.

1725
03:01:11.091 --> 03:01:13.927
-Artillery?
-I can't.

1726
03:01:15.137 --> 03:01:18.098
They won't be coming for money,
not the best of them.

1727
03:01:18.390 --> 03:01:20.601
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1728
03:01:21.685 --> 03:01:23.729
Which I'm going to give them.

1729
03:01:24.438 --> 03:01:26.231
That's all I want.

1730
03:01:27.274 --> 03:01:30.235
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

1731
03:01:30.402 --> 03:01:34.698
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

1732
03:01:34.948 --> 03:01:38.118
And when we've got it,
we'll keep it.

1733
03:01:38.368 --> 03:01:40.788
You can tell the politicians
to burn their bit of paper now.

1734
03:01:40.954 --> 03:01:42.289
Fair enough.

1735
03:01:42.790 --> 03:01:45.709
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

1736
03:01:46.418 --> 03:01:48.337
It's going to happen.

1737
03:01:49.046 --> 03:01:51.131
I shall want quite a lot of money.

1738
03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:53.550
All there is.

1739
03:01:54.051 --> 03:01:55.636
Not that much.

1740
03:01:58.931 --> 03:02:01.683
The best of them
won't come for money.

1741
03:02:03.602 --> 03:02:04.978
They'll come for me.

1742
03:02:05.187 --> 03:02:09.691
<i>CROWD".
Lawrence! Lawrence! Lawrence!</i>

1743
03:02:23.413 --> 03:02:24.915
No pictures! You take no pictures.

1744
03:02:24.998 --> 03:02:27.501
It's not for you, Sheik Auda,
it's for Major Lawrence.

1745
03:02:27.584 --> 03:02:31.797
He doesn't mind having his picture taken.
He doesn't mind at all.

1746
03:02:31.964 --> 03:02:34.216
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

1747
