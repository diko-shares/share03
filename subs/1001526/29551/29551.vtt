00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh man...

2
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,440
I'll be up in a bit.

3
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,080
You better.

4
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,440
Larry?

5
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,880
What?

6
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,400
That.

7
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,120
What's that box
doing in our bedroom?

8
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,640
Uh... I...

9
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,520
I don't know, maybe
one of the crew left it.

10
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,720
- Why'd they do that?
- I don't know.

11
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,640
What is it?

12
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,960
A card,
"FOR THE COLLECTION"

13
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,280
Don't open it.

14
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,840
No!

15
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,400
Jesus...
Oh God!

16
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,800
Is everything alright?

17
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,200
Uh... just about as good as new.

18
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh yeah, Arkin?

19
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,840
After you look at the door upstairs, could
you get the last of the window bars up
today?

20
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Yeah, not a problem, sir.

21
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
I know we're in
middle of nowhere, but ...

22
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,480
Vicky still insists on Victorian decor.

23
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,640
CHASE JEWELLERS
MICHAEL CHASE - PRESIDENT

24
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,360
What shall I call you?

25
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,600
How about Jill?

26
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,400
Bye, Jill.

27
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,640
Hey!

28
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,080
I'm a mermaid.

29
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Okay.

30
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,920
I'm having a tea party,
Mr. Arkin.

31
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,720
- Oh well ...
- Would you care to join us?

32
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,720
Sure.

33
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
It's... it's very good.

34
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,680
He made the tea.

35
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,560
Well, it's very good, sir.

36
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
You have a very nice room,
Hannah.

37
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,480
This isn't my room.

38
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
- No?
- I'm a mermaid.

39
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,960
Okay.

40
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,480
Mermaids sleep in caves,
not rooms.

41
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,520
Can I ask you something?

42
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,080
If you were to really
want a present.

43
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,040
Something really special.

44
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,240
What would it be?

45
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,120
A baskin bear.

46
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,200
Where would you get
a... baskin bear at?

47
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,960
Toy store.

48
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,960
Of course.

49
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,200
Whoa! Excuse me!

50
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,600
- Is everything alright in here?
- Yeah um, she...

51
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,480
Hannah just uh... invited me
to her tea party.

52
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,000
Is that right?

53
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
I'm sorry, sir.

54
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,120
I have one about her age.
A daughter.

55
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,000
Name's Cindy.

56
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,280
Oh...

57
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,640
- Okay well uh...
- Well, I got your door working.

58
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,040
Well, thanks.

59
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,440
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Arkin.

60
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
Hey!

61
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,400
There's a wasp nest over there.

62
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,680
There's a wasp nest,
by the... by the greenhouse.

63
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,360
Hey.

64
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,920
Let me bum a drag.

65
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,640
Sorry, I'm not adding
to your... delinquency.

66
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,120
What are you, a narc?

67
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,800
Give me a drag.

68
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,760
Arkin, right?

69
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Mm hmm.

70
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
What kind of name is
Arkin, anyway?

71
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,080
It's a first name.
What kind of name is Jill?

72
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,640
It's my grandmother's name.

73
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,960
She was the first female
Attorney General in the State.

74
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,400
You're about to hear a fight.

75
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,560
You done somethin' ?

76
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,880
Yeah, but don't freak.
It's just a show.

77
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,680
You better gimme
that back then.

78
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,360
I wouldn't wanna ruin
your performance.

79
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,280
Later, Arkin.

80
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,160
Nice try.

81
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,720
I told you mom,
I don't wanna go.

82
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,200
You can't do this to me.

83
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
All of my friends are
staying here. I cannot go!

84
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,040
It's not an option!

85
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,800
You're going.

86
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,080
I'm not going on a
family vacation with you!

87
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,560
Arkin.

88
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,480
- For the week.
- Thank you.

89
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,240
There is a little bit of extra there.

90
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,720
Oh, no, sir,
I can't take extra.

91
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
No no, it's... it's for the
little one.

92
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
I know how tough it can be.

93
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,240
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

94
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,720
You earned it.

95
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
Listen, spend as much time as
you can with them when they're young.

96
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,760
Something happens around age 13
and it get's kind of rough for awhile.

97
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,960
What I understand?
Eventually they come back around.

98
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,360
Anyway, see you in
a couple of weeks.

99
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,000
Have a safe trip!

100
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,280
What you doing there,
baby girl?

101
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Daddy!

102
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,680
Shh... keep quiet for just a sec.

103
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
I've got someone who
wants to meet you.

104
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,040
Who?

105
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,840
He says you have
to close your eyes.

106
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,200
Alright, go ahead and
open them.

107
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,320
Do I get to keep him?

108
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,640
Of course you get to
keep him.

109
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,480
Do you have it?

110
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,080
Whoa.

111
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,440
What is that?

112
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,760
Daddy got him for me.

113
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,400
God damn it.

114
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,160
- Thank you Daddy.
- You're welcome, Cindy.

115
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,600
Hey!

116
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
You're supposed to
come by 6 hours ago.

117
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,840
Yeah, so I just got a bit
tied up at work, you know?

118
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,360
Do you or don't you
have the money?

119
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,360
Look, it's not as much
as I said, but...

120
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,040
it's something.

121
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,880
What is this?

122
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,840
You promised you'd
get it by tonight.

123
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
I know,

124
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,680
but these jobs don't
just happen overnight.

125
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,520
- I have to have it today.
- Why today?

126
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,360
Because the people
I owe want it.

127
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,720
So why don't you let me talk
to the people that you owe?

128
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
They're loansharks, Arkin.

129
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,400
It's due. That's all there is to it.

130
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,880
- I'm leaving tonight.
- Where're you gonna go?

131
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,800
You gonna go to your Mom's?
Or your sister's?

132
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,400
And all this shit, what're you gonna do?
You gonna just disappear?

133
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
They're gonna chase you!

134
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,240
Look, I'm gonna get you
the money, alright?

135
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
No, it's too late.

136
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,240
No baby, come here.

137
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,000
Just give me until midnight,
alright?

138
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,320
Midnight.

139
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,920
- Hello?
- Found what we're looking for.

140
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
I'm going in and I
gotta get paid tonight.

141
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,440
No way. On whose...

142
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,560
I'm coming over right now.

143
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,920
You would've grown it to
a skin there, kiddo.

144
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,880
Now you've been casing
that family's house for months...

145
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And now that you've found
the jewel broker's safe...

146
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You go to come in here.

147
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,520
With demands.

148
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,320
We settle tonight.

149
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,080
50% take.
The family is out of town.

150
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,400
The stone is inside,

151
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,040
and I need to get
paid tonight.

152
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,800
We got a routine.

153
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,600
I pick the jobs.
You pick the locks.

154
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,800
We pick up the prize together.

155
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,880
That's the routine.

156
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,120
You don't change routine.

157
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
That's when mistakes happen.

158
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,360
Tonight. Midnight.

159
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
No can do.

160
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,640
I guess I'll find
somebody that will.

161
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,520
I run a...

162
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,200
smooth operation
out here.

163
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,040
You helped me on
the inside.

164
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,440
You did.

165
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,560
But I never agreed
to your terms.

166
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,360
Taking my help means
you did motherfucker!

167
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,600
You don't come up here all
hopped up in your macho bullshit!

168
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,200
You need to be thinkin'
about that woman of yours,

169
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,680
and that little pretty
girl of yours.

170
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,400
Now...

171
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,960
What was that
request of yours?

172
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,320
We settle tonight.
50% take.

173
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
You don't like
your fingers do you?

174
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,360
Huh motherfucker?

175
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,080
I am the only guy that you
know that can get into that safe.

176
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,320
So you got a better option
than me? Then roll it out!

177
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,320
50.

178
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,320
40. You take it or leave it.

179
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,320
I guess I'lI see ya
later tonight then.

180
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,080
"Just give me until midnight."

181
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,680
"Midnight."

182
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,160
Let go of me!
Please leave me alone!

183
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,400
You!

184
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
Why are you doing this?

185
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Why are you doing this?

186
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,560
You son of a bitch...

187
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,000
You son of a bitch!

188
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,560
Shit...

189
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,120
Just stop! Stop!
Shh...

190
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,160
Shut the fuck up!
I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you.

191
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,080
Michael, listen...

192
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,560
I have nothing to do with this.
You gotta believe me, okay?

193
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,120
There were... there were
tools down here right?

194
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,120
- Where were they?
- I don't know, he took 'em.

195
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,400
Oh God!
Shh! Shh!

196
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,280
My wife... my wife...
how... my wife...

197
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,120
Where... where's your wife?

198
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,800
She's in there.

199
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,600
Where's Jill and Hannah?

200
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,120
Jill left before he got here.

201
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,640
And Hannah is she in here?

202
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
I don't know.

203
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,000
God, I don't know...
I don't...

204
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,320
Okay, I'm gonna find 'em.
I'll find them. Calm down.

205
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,600
My gun ...

206
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,640
It's the only way,
you have get my handgun.

207
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,080
You got a gun?
Where is your gun?

208
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,480
It's in the safe in my bedroom.

209
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,960
Behind the mirror.

210
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Bullets are in the bottom drawer.

211
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,640
What's the combination?

212
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,880
15 ... 24 ... 7.

213
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,200
15-24-7, all right.
Just stay quiet.

214
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,480
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

215
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,520
Oh God!

216
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Hey! Hey! I'm here to
help you. It's ok. Shh...

217
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,040
We're taking that
gag off okay?

218
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,880
Yeah... yeah...

219
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,440
Can you get this off my eyes?

220
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,200
Please ...

221
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,400
Nah... Nah... listen,
I can't. I can't.

222
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,560
- Why?
- I can't take that off.

223
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,360
Have you seen Hannah?
Where's my baby?

224
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,720
I didn't see her. I don't
think she's in the house.

225
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,720
No no... she's hiding.
He hasn't got to her yet.

226
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,240
You have to find her.

227
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,720
Okay, okay I will.
I'll keep looking.

228
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,240
- My baby ...
- Shh!

229
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,840
Victoria, I will.
I'll get her, okay?

230
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,440
But listen, I need you to do
something for me, okay?

231
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,920
I need you to help me.
I'm gonna need you to scream.

232
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,760
Oh no... no no...

233
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,120
Listen, I just need a distraction
so I can get up there.

234
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
If I get up there,
I can find Hannah.

235
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,400
But I need to get upstairs.

236
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,760
When he comes down here, stop
screaming so he doesn't hurt you, alright?

237
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,960
Can you do that?

238
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,240
It's okay.

239
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,280
I'm gonna get you out of
here but I need your help.

240
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,280
I need to get up there.

241
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,560
- Okay?
- Okay...

242
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,280
Give me just a second,
and then you start screamin'.

243
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,960
- I promise you I'll be back.
- Okay...

244
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,560
No!

245
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,360
There's no fuckin' bullets...
Where's the fucking bullets?

246
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,800
Hannah?

247
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,280
Hannah is that you?

248
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,320
Hannah?

249
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,320
Hannah is that you?

250
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,360
Hannah?

251
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,000
- Get out!
- Who the hell are you?

252
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,040
Larry Horn.

253
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,960
Jesus ...

254
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,560
No... no...

255
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,680
What does this guy want?
What... what does he want?

256
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,000
He collects people ...

257
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,520
No no, he's killing people.
He's killing them.

258
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,720
No no no, he only kills people
that he doesn't want.

259
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,040
The rest he takes.
He takes them.

260
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,000
Then why are you here?

261
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,640
I'm the bait.

262
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,000
If you're not chosen, you'll
never leave this house alive!

263
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,880
He only takes one!
He only takes one... no!

264
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,960
No!
No!

265
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,240
Hey, it's me...

266
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,240
Come here.

267
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,240
Let's get this off you.

268
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,000
Come on, get it off.
Get it off, come on.

269
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,280
I couldn't find Hannah anywhere.
I don't think she's in the house.

270
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,760
She has to be here.

271
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,400
I looked everywhere.
I didn't see her.

272
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,960
Where's Michael?
-He's okay. He's fine.

273
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,960
After I get you out of here,
I'm gonna get him out of here okay?

274
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,720
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

275
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,280
I gotta get outta here...
I gotta get outta here!

276
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,800
Please, one second...
One second...

277
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,120
A robbery... I've prepared myself
for that but not this... not this!

278
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,320
I don't wanna die!

279
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,800
You're not gonna die!

280
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,320
Shh... shh... You're not
gonna die. Shh... shh...

281
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,240
- Hold still.
- And Hannah, gonna get Hannah.

282
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,480
And Hannah too.

283
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,800
Now listen, when we get
outta here,

284
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,840
I'm gonna hide you okay?

285
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,320
You can't say a word, okay?

286
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,760
And when we go out of here,
you keep your eyes on my back.

287
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,280
Alright? Keep your eyes
on my back. Come on...

288
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,520
Why didn't you listen to me!

289
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,680
I told you to stay with me!

290
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,320
Shit.

291
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,520
Easy... you'll wake the neighbors.

292
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,240
What neighbors?

293
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,320
Hey.

294
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,320
Hey!

295
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,600
Jill, stop!

296
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,880
Jill!

297
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,120
Let's do it right here.

298
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,640
I'm not doing it on
my front porch.

299
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,520
Damn it.

300
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,880
What?

301
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,800
I think my mom
changed the locks on me.

302
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,120
You sure they're not here?

303
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,800
Yeah, positive.

304
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,600
Let's go.

305
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,680
Definitely not typical.

306
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,680
Who cares?

307
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,200
I don't think so.

308
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,440
Where do think
you're going?

309
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,800
I really think we
should do it right.

310
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,480
Oh...

311
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,320
911, please state
your emergency.

312
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,920
Oh God no.

313
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,400
Oh my God!

314
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,400
Hey! Hey!

315
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,720
Don't make a sound!
It's me!

316
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,480
What are you doing here?

317
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,960
I'm gonna get you out of here.

318
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,040
- Where is my family?
- Jill, you gotta be quiet!

319
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,840
Look at me!
You gotta be quiet!

320
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,480
Come on...

321
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,000
No... no...

322
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,680
No!

323
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,560
Jill! Don't!

324
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,600
Help me. Help me please!

325
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,400
You gotta push...
Help me here!

326
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,040
Help me...

327
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,440
- Help me... please help me.
- You gotta help me push up!

328
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,680
No... no... no! Please don't leave me!

329
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,480
No... no... please...

330
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,320
No! No! Please! Please!
Please come back!

331
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,080
- I'm sorry...
- Please come back!

332
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,800
Please don't go!

333
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,640
Run... run little girl.

334
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,880
Run!

335
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,720
Where the hell were you?

336
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,160
Please, don't let
the man get me.

337
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,120
We're gonna lose him now ok?
Now, would you listen to me?

338
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,720
- You gotta stay off the floor ok?
- I can do that.

339
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,560
- Alright, you can do that?
- Yeah... yeah.

340
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,000
Now!

341
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,160
Damn it!

342
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,280
Damn! Fuck!

343
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,080
The laundry chute!

344
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,520
Does it go all the way down?

345
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:41,000
I want you to get outta the way ok?
I'm coming right behind you.

346
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,240
Just let her go.

347
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,360
You got her father.

348
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,760
You got me.
Just let her go.

349
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,560
You never would've
found her anyway.

350
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,040
Stay away!

351
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,960
Where are you going?

352
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,240
Is that all you got?
You little bitch!

353
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,800
Is that all you got?
You fucking faggot!

354
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,840
Is that all you got?
You little fucking faggot bitch!

355
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,920
Come here you faggot!
I'm gonna eat your fucking heart!

356
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,560
Fuck you!

357
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,640
Get it off!
Get it off!

358
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,280
Get it off me!

01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,600
Get away!

01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:38,040
Dispatch, this is unit 316
responding to a possible 911.

361
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,160
Oh my God.

362
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,120
Freeze!
Do not move!

363
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,600
Freeze!

364
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,720
Raise your arms!

365
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,200
Raise 'em!

366
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,480
Drop your weapon!

367
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,960
Drop the weapon!

368
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,160
Unit 316, dispatch...

369
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,440
Hannah?
Hannah, stay back.

370
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,920
My God, he's gonna
blow the house up.

371
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,080
He's gonna blow up
the house.

372
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,360
Unit 316, all units
are responding.

373
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,640
Hurry!

374
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:43,840
He's coming!

375
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,360
He's supposed to come
down the stairs okay?

376
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,200
He's coming! Hurry!

377
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,360
I'm gonna go up there and
I'm gonna pull you up okay?

378
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,520
- Okay.
- Stay right here.

379
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,240
What are you doing?

380
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,840
Come here...
You gotta help me.

381
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,080
It's broken.

382
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,720
This guy, the exterminator.

383
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,720
He was the same guy working
earlier in the day right?

384
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:20,720
And you saw his face?

385
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,240
Yes, I saw.

386
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,720
What happened
inside the house?

387
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,600
Tried to save 'em...

388
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,400
I really did...

389
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:35,040
Sir? Company's called MASTER TRAP
EXTERMINATION. We got an address.

390
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,600
Pull him tight and get
him to the hospital.

391
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,480
What time is it?

392
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,200
Just before midnight.

393
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,280
I made it.

394
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,080
What?

395
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,480
I need you to
call my wife.

396
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,280
They'll take care of
all that at the hospital.

397
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,800
Come on now. You gotta...
You gotta call her.

398
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,360
Alright! Alright!
