1
00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:23,052
All I know about the war

2
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:25,646
is that the Germans invaded Luxembourg.

3
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:28,935
For 4 years Luxembourg
was occupied by the Nazis.

4
00:00:29,977 --> 00:00:31,854
The war ended long ago,

5
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:36,130
but there is still a lot of talk
about all that happened then.

6
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:39,010
Most people here were
against the Nazis.

7
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:42,129
But there were those
that were on their side.

8
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:45,256
Nobody has ever
explained it all to me.

9
00:00:45,457 --> 00:00:48,369
My Papa always says
I'm too young for all that.

10
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:52,286
When the Americans liberated us,
and forced the Nazis back,

11
00:00:52,497 --> 00:00:54,772
the difficult years were behind us.

12
00:00:55,337 --> 00:00:59,489
I was born 6 years after the war.
Now I'm 12 years old.

13
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:16,378
Perl or Pica

14
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:09,652
Norbi!

15
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:52,246
Time should just stand still.

16
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:53,816
But it never does.

17
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:56,008
The clock is always on Papa's side.

18
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:43,051
- I know, I'm late.
- Go and wash your hands.

19
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:29,492
Just a minute...

20
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:32,966
50 seconds to gulp down
a soup would be a record.

21
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:34,132
You stay out of it.

22
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:35,287
Come on now!

23
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:38,535
Pretend it's cream of sorrel soup.

24
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:41,008
There's crap in the soup!

25
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:44,727
Your mother doesn't cook crap.

26
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:53,735
Alright then. Come...

27
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:55,492
Papa! Don't!

28
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,207
So.

29
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:10,167
Today he laid it on really hard...

30
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,656
He just wants your plate cleaned.

31
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,652
Next time I'll eat your soup.

32
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,992
What's that red mark on your neck?

33
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:21,317
You've been spying!

34
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:24,131
- Show me!
- No, it's nothing to do with you.

35
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:25,287
What is it?

36
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:26,407
A love bite.

37
00:06:26,657 --> 00:06:28,488
You get it when you kiss.

38
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:32,613
- Has Papa seen it?
- If you tell on me, I'm warning you...

39
00:06:33,897 --> 00:06:36,809
In your nightdress already?
Just look at that!

40
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:38,854
- It wasn't me.
- Who was it, then?

41
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:40,769
How am I going to get that clean?

42
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:43,326
I slave away the whole day as it is.

43
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,209
Have you any idea what it cost?

44
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:49,412
Those Wop whores attacked us!

45
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:51,295
Watch your language.

46
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:53,375
And did they do it in your bed?

47
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,374
I had to change your bed
again this morning.

48
00:06:55,737 --> 00:06:57,489
I can't help it!

49
00:06:58,337 --> 00:06:59,213
Norbi!

50
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:10,813
If I think really hard on my bladder,
that should do it.

51
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,692
Bladder, are you listening to me?

52
00:07:14,177 --> 00:07:16,737
No puddles tonight. Agreed?

53
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,252
Shit.

54
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:42,446
Pick that up.

55
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:49,972
Norbi!

56
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,571
Pick it up yourself.

57
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:55,132
Our altar boy is getting angry.

58
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:12,125
Mecki's coming.

59
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:25,295
Good morning, teacher.

60
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:32,009
Sit.

61
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,295
You call that monitoring?

62
00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:45,607
Date.

63
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:46,813
Zantin!

64
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:50,850
26th of March 1962, Sir.

65
00:09:51,097 --> 00:09:51,973
Added together?

66
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:54,213
2 and 6 is eight...

67
00:09:54,737 --> 00:09:56,887
and 3 is 11...

68
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,608
and 1 is...

69
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:01,807
12...

70
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:06,812
2 plus 9 is 11.

71
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:08,013
Sit.

72
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:10,969
Times 12, divided by 6?

73
00:10:11,217 --> 00:10:11,967
Scholtes!

74
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,485
100 lines!

75
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:18,533
"I must listen when my classmates
are being asked a question!"

76
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:19,807
Welscheid!

77
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:24,048
11 times 12 is...

78
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:28,008
The result of the calculation is unimportant.

79
00:10:28,257 --> 00:10:31,215
I'm sure Treines is out to get Backes.

80
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:32,731
22. Sir.

81
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:35,775
22... Backes!

82
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:42,490
- Have you done your homework?
- Yes, Sir.

83
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:48,892
Always me.

84
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:51,531
Why am I always picked on?

85
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:57,534
What do other mothers say when their
boys come home with torn pullovers?

86
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:02,208
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

87
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,885
How does it work?
There's no aerial.

88
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,213
- Hello, Auntie Zess.
- Hello. Norbi.

89
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:11,092
A parcel arrived,
from Aunt Jacqueline in America.

90
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,089
That's for you.

91
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:16,373
Have you seen what she sent me?

92
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:17,892
It's great.

93
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,491
I'm very excited.

94
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:33,367
It's fantastic.

95
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:34,493
Try it on.

96
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,933
I'll just go and hang up my jacket.

97
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:41,966
Can you manage?

98
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:49,286
Can he wear that to church?

99
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:50,811
Well it is very smart.

100
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:52,450
Like an American.

101
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:55,212
Do you like it?

102
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:00,528
It suits you.

103
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:04,733
- Where did you get the anorak?
- From America.

104
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:07,055
My aunt sent it to me.

105
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:09,129
It was expensive, I'm sure.

106
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:12,611
Somebody's been killed!

107
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,409
- Stabbed 20 times in the heart!
- Where?

108
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:16,375
North Furnace Street.

109
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:17,532
Let's go!

110
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:52,975
They found a corpse. Stabbed!
Everything was covered in blood.

111
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:56,495
What were you doing there?

112
00:12:56,697 --> 00:12:58,176
We were just looking.

113
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,050
We saw them carry the dead body out.

114
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:02,651
I don't want to hear anything about it.

115
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:04,615
I don't want you looking at things like that.

116
00:13:04,857 --> 00:13:06,768
- We...
- Give me the ruler.

117
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:12,449
Why is the candle here?

118
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:16,054
So there will never be another war.

119
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:19,935
Can I have one too?

120
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:34,966
Why do I only get such a small candle?

121
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:38,249
Do you believe that God is just
as satisfied with a small candle?

122
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,130
I think so...

123
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:46,416
What does REM mean?

124
00:13:47,337 --> 00:13:48,690
It means remit.

125
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:52,085
That is when you subtract
something from a customer.

126
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,535
What do you subtract?

127
00:13:56,057 --> 00:13:57,570
You just say it like that.

128
00:13:58,617 --> 00:14:01,768
The customer has to pay less...
and that's subtracted from the till at night.

129
00:14:02,017 --> 00:14:05,009
Some customers
want a reduction on everything.

130
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:06,151
Even for a bar of soap.

131
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:09,812
Oh, Mr Weldscheid...
can you give me a reduction?

132
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:16,375
What's the "P" mean?

133
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:20,287
Nothing.

134
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:27,006
Sister Bernadette.

135
00:14:27,377 --> 00:14:28,696
Sister Mara, good morning to you!

136
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:36,814
We would like a typewriter

137
00:14:42,337 --> 00:14:43,895
Here we have...

138
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:46,847
the SM-20. Our newest model,

139
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:49,015
a very practical machine

140
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:53,693
What's the difference
between the two models?

141
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:57,256
The difference lies mainly in the typeface.

142
00:14:58,057 --> 00:14:59,126
We have

143
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:01,325
two typefaces:

144
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:04,294
Perl or Pica.

145
00:15:04,497 --> 00:15:06,089
This is Pica. This is Perl.

146
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:12,607
These are the only two
that are exported overseas.

147
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:15,810
Typewriters are like churches:

148
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:17,450
There is a limited choice.

149
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:25,089
And just what do you mean?

150
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:28,289
My dear Sister, one goes
either to heaven or to hell.

151
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:32,488
What do they cost?

152
00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:34,969
They both cost the same.

153
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:37,168
5,740 Francs.

154
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:42,015
With a case. Of course!

155
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:44,366
That is...

156
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:46,176
not exactly a gift.

157
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:48,734
I can give you a little reduction.

158
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:53,291
Let's say 5.200.

159
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:57,412
Hope God will remember this later.

160
00:15:59,017 --> 00:16:01,167
We will have to think about it.

161
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:05,287
Goodbye.

162
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:10,935
We'll never see those two again.

163
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:13,133
- You want to bet?
- 20 Francs?

164
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:14,412
You're on!

165
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:18,813
When the alarm goes off,
get up and go to the toilet.

166
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:21,691
Then you'll be all right till the morning.

167
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:24,532
Good night.

168
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:28,766
Sleep well.

169
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:38,252
Good night.

170
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:20,051
My Papa is hiding something.

171
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:41,566
I don't understand what it is.

172
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:42,926
Why "P"?

173
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:47,129
Maybe he keeps an account of his sins.

174
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:50,016
After he dies he has to
show the book to God...

175
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:52,811
and then he decides
if it's heaven or hell.

176
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:02,375
( Who knows the truth? )

177
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:27,854
When boys stroke their penis,

178
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,527
and excite their body...

179
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:33,012
to ejaculation,

180
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:35,608
this is called the sin...

181
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:38,206
of masturbation, or impurity.

182
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:42,088
This can do them harm.

183
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:45,534
In the long term these boys
grow weak and exhausted.

184
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,091
Red patches...

185
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:49,527
may appear all over the body.

186
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:23,053
Norbi!

187
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:27,451
Wake up!

188
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:33,245
The priest called.

189
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:34,810
Someone's dying.

190
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:36,652
Are you awake?

191
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:11,407
I hope it takes a long time today.

192
00:21:11,657 --> 00:21:14,171
Then I can skip maths.

193
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:19,013
You're here at last!

194
00:21:24,257 --> 00:21:25,975
Fear thou no longer,

195
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,765
For I am with thee.

196
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:30,968
He doesn't understand Luxembourgian.

197
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:32,411
During the night he went...

198
00:21:33,737 --> 00:21:36,615
I woke up.
A horrible noise...

199
00:21:37,017 --> 00:21:38,973
Mucus came out of his mouth.

200
00:21:39,217 --> 00:21:41,173
I called for you immediately.

201
00:21:50,937 --> 00:21:53,656
I hope this woman
gets out her purse soon.

202
00:21:53,857 --> 00:21:57,293
I never know if the people
are going to give me a tip.

203
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:59,613
She looks a bit mean to me.

204
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:00,647
Amen.

205
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,533
This is for you. Goodbye.

206
00:22:16,577 --> 00:22:17,407
Goodbye.

207
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,090
Good morning, Sir.

208
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:57,727
Sit.

209
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:01,653
Give me that.

210
00:23:06,977 --> 00:23:10,572
You might  learn something
new if you read it...

211
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,973
...maybe for a stupid dictation.

212
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:27,011
The first one to talk, is out that door!

213
00:23:28,177 --> 00:23:29,895
You can't cheat on the entrance exam.

214
00:23:30,097 --> 00:23:32,327
And you just wait till you're
in grammar school!

215
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:36,175
You're too stupid even for construction work.

216
00:23:39,657 --> 00:23:40,772
Open your books.

217
00:25:01,057 --> 00:25:02,968
Now Treines is in his element.

218
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:07,092
He's remembering the times,
when he was still "Little Mecki."

219
00:25:11,697 --> 00:25:13,494
Ambush?
What kind of rubbish is that?

220
00:25:13,977 --> 00:25:14,932
Damn it.

221
00:25:15,257 --> 00:25:16,576
Out... On the double!

222
00:25:18,777 --> 00:25:20,529
And close the door from the other side!

223
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:21,487
And...

224
00:25:22,377 --> 00:25:24,447
you can forget the entrance exam too.

225
00:25:25,937 --> 00:25:28,895
If my Papa knew what I spent my money on.

226
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:32,455
It doesn't matter,
This is how to make yourself popular:

227
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:36,332
First you're beaten half to death,
and then pleaded with,

228
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,455
because you earn money as altar boy.

229
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:10,526
Where have you been?

230
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,695
- Your teacher was here.
- You read trashy comics!

231
00:26:14,057 --> 00:26:15,775
Don't we have enough books here?

232
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,335
I don't read trashy comics.

233
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,348
And this?

234
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:21,326
What is that?

235
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:25,335
Don't you know what you're doing?

236
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:27,209
Don't you know what that means?

237
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:29,811
Read!

238
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:41,734
Aren't you able to read a text
without pictures anymore?

239
00:26:41,937 --> 00:26:43,689
Trash...

240
00:26:43,897 --> 00:26:48,607
like the comic books "Tarzan," "Sigurd,"
or 'Akim," encourage the power of evil.

241
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:52,885
Children become absent-minded,
suffering from neuroses and sleeplessness.

242
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:55,933
Just as excessive masturbation...

243
00:26:56,177 --> 00:26:59,374
Is accompanied by over-excitement
of the senses and insomnia.

244
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,568
One might add "bed wetting!"

245
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:02,533
Come with me!

246
00:27:04,177 --> 00:27:04,973
Do it!

247
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,412
Set it on fire!

248
00:27:07,457 --> 00:27:08,685
It doesn't belong to me.

249
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:11,768
Shall I get the whip?

250
00:27:17,017 --> 00:27:18,973
My own dear son.
I never expected this from you.

251
00:27:32,037 --> 00:27:32,737
Come,

252
00:27:32,977 --> 00:27:34,251
help me.

253
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:37,006
Look...

254
00:27:37,977 --> 00:27:40,093
You can have a few bunnies.

255
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:52,492
Good afternoon.

256
00:28:01,337 --> 00:28:02,975
These are the new tenants.

257
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:08,930
What's their name?

258
00:28:09,177 --> 00:28:10,212
Pinato.

259
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:12,336
They're Italians.

260
00:28:14,577 --> 00:28:15,771
Here's the key.

261
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:18,007
Thank you.

262
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:24,372
Goodbye.

263
00:28:28,017 --> 00:28:28,893
Goodbye.

264
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:35,445
With a 'P' ?

265
00:28:36,577 --> 00:28:38,647
Of course!

266
00:29:00,417 --> 00:29:01,532
Do you know him?

267
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:05,574
He is the son of the widow who
lives in the Lorenzini's house.

268
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,735
His Papa was a Kraut
supporter in the war.

269
00:29:07,937 --> 00:29:09,086
The boy can't do anything about that.

270
00:29:10,737 --> 00:29:12,887
I don't want Norbi associating with him.

271
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:38,409
Do you think there will be another war?

272
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:40,812
Be careful.

273
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:43,214
Like with the Germans?

274
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:51,136
Can I try it?

275
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:05,086
Why do you want to hide your grey hair?

276
00:30:07,017 --> 00:30:10,168
People don't have to
know everything about you

277
00:30:11,257 --> 00:30:13,930
Is a Bolshevist something
like an Algonquin?

278
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:15,007
Yes.

279
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:18,489
What's an Algonquin?

280
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:26,211
Hello, Eugène.

281
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,651
Hello, Zess.

282
00:30:28,777 --> 00:30:30,176
What on earth happened to you?

283
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:31,412
What do you mean?

284
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,371
Were you attacked?

285
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:37,493
Aren't you too hot in that thing?

286
00:30:41,777 --> 00:30:43,574
That 'thing' is an anorak.

287
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:48,096
Are you going to eat with us, Zess?

288
00:30:48,337 --> 00:30:50,214
Not if it's French toast...

289
00:30:50,497 --> 00:30:51,816
You're so picky.

290
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,416
Not all of us can afford steak.

291
00:30:53,617 --> 00:30:55,812
A good businessman like you?

292
00:30:56,097 --> 00:30:57,815
You can't fool me.

293
00:30:58,577 --> 00:31:02,411
If you eat too much steak
your hair stands on end.

294
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:05,810
And real butter...

295
00:31:06,017 --> 00:31:07,848
there's none of that either?

296
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:09,412
Fine. I'm going now.

297
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:12,490
I've still got some fruit salad at home.

298
00:31:14,377 --> 00:31:15,810
That's good for your complexion.

299
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:32,808
I like weddings best of all.

300
00:31:33,177 --> 00:31:35,088
There's money to jingle in my pocket.

301
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:37,568
And my Papa is a different person.

302
00:31:37,777 --> 00:31:39,893
Up in the gallery,
he's in seventh heaven.

303
00:31:41,297 --> 00:31:43,970
Now I know he's hiding
something from me.

304
00:31:44,617 --> 00:31:47,177
What can be behind this "P"?

305
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:07,372
Go on that side.

306
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:11,976
Come let's try it...

307
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:13,487
So: 1,2...

308
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:15,176
start with the right...

309
00:32:17,857 --> 00:32:18,846
No, on 3.

310
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:30,450
- Don't you want to anymore?
- No

311
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,136
You can't see anything... the sun...

312
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:22,246
What are you doing here?

313
00:33:29,777 --> 00:33:31,256
Are you completely crazy?

314
00:33:34,937 --> 00:33:37,497
- Where is your mother?
- At a meeting of 'Wives and Mothers."

315
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:39,655
Who allowed you to come here?

316
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:41,775
Paulette has often been here.

317
00:33:41,977 --> 00:33:44,172
- We didn't do anything.
- We didn't do anything.

318
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:45,970
What does that mean?

319
00:33:46,177 --> 00:33:47,576
That's what you call: "nothing"?

320
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:51,247
If I tell your father,
he'll show you what "nothing" means!

321
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:57,730
- Who does the radio belong to?
- Auntie Jacqueline gave it to me.

322
00:33:57,937 --> 00:33:58,687
You were there!

323
00:33:59,257 --> 00:34:01,487
- And what's this?
- It's Paulette's.

324
00:34:02,017 --> 00:34:02,847
Give me that trash.

325
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:05,287
-That's my magazine!
- You go home now!

326
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:13,088
- And in my house too.
- So what?

327
00:34:13,297 --> 00:34:16,653
Do you think your house is different
just because you're a little priest?

328
00:34:20,177 --> 00:34:22,054
I don't want to see her here ever again.

329
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:47,257
Maybe Papa looks at this secretly.

330
00:34:47,457 --> 00:34:48,856
Or Treines.

331
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:55,686
I bet they'd stammer through confession then.

332
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,412
The nuns bought a typewriter!

333
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:38,369
Pica.

334
00:35:39,977 --> 00:35:40,773
Good!

335
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,530
And my 20 francs?

336
00:35:47,497 --> 00:35:48,850
What 20 francs?

337
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:50,172
Our bet!

338
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:54,173
What bet?

339
00:35:55,691 --> 00:35:57,127
Ah! That bet!

340
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:07,732
There. My son.

341
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:10,651
May I leave the table?

342
00:36:16,657 --> 00:36:17,692
Good afternoon.

343
00:36:20,777 --> 00:36:21,812
Mr. Meyer.

344
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:27,254
Why didn't you tell me
that Mr. Meyer was here?

345
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:31,456
Excuse me,

346
00:36:31,737 --> 00:36:33,455
my son is a little shy.

347
00:36:35,337 --> 00:36:37,134
Norbi. Mr. Meyer...

348
00:36:37,377 --> 00:36:40,494
is here to help you with
your incontinence problem.

349
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,729
As I said, he still wets the bed.

350
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:50,529
Let's go to his room... let's see...

351
00:36:51,337 --> 00:36:53,055
- Alright?
- Alright, let's go.

352
00:37:23,697 --> 00:37:24,925
It's coming from here.

353
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,526
See that?

354
00:37:33,057 --> 00:37:34,126
Look!

355
00:37:34,737 --> 00:37:35,886
Look at it.

356
00:37:44,657 --> 00:37:45,885
It's water.

357
00:37:49,537 --> 00:37:50,287
What water?

358
00:37:50,857 --> 00:37:52,006
Mr. Welscheid.

359
00:37:52,257 --> 00:37:55,329
There is water flowing under the house.

360
00:37:57,097 --> 00:37:59,531
It could also be...

361
00:37:59,937 --> 00:38:02,087
a branch of the river Alzette.

362
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:07,332
The Alzette comes from there,

363
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,255
and flows that way.

364
00:38:12,137 --> 00:38:12,933
His penis...

365
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:14,536
is directed down river.

366
00:38:14,817 --> 00:38:17,172
That's why you urinate, my boy.

367
00:38:17,537 --> 00:38:18,765
You know what, little man?

368
00:38:19,257 --> 00:38:21,327
We'll move the furniture
around this evening.

369
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:36,972
Just look at them.

370
00:39:00,457 --> 00:39:02,971
A billion heathen children...

371
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:05,936
So children...

372
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,453
if you want the little
heathens to be baptised,

373
00:39:09,737 --> 00:39:12,456
you have to give me 10 francs.

374
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:14,814
And whoever gives me 10 francs,

375
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:17,372
will get one of these pictures.

376
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:23,847
Here.

377
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:26,810
You can choose one.

378
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:32,690
Anyone else?

379
00:39:34,257 --> 00:39:35,326
Norbi?

380
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:36,846
What do you think?

381
00:39:37,057 --> 00:39:39,525
Why should I buy a little heathen?

382
00:39:40,737 --> 00:39:43,171
I need my money for other things.

383
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:45,727
I don't have any money
with me. Chaplain.

384
00:39:46,257 --> 00:39:47,292
Children...

385
00:39:47,977 --> 00:39:50,286
Remember my words,

386
00:39:50,497 --> 00:39:53,295
Every time a little heathen dies,

387
00:39:53,497 --> 00:39:56,091
without being baptised,

388
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:58,487
they go to Purgatory.

389
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:01,295
Can you imagine that?

390
00:40:01,497 --> 00:40:02,771
Purgatory.

391
00:40:04,457 --> 00:40:05,685
Children...

392
00:40:06,497 --> 00:40:07,691
Our dear Lord...

393
00:40:07,937 --> 00:40:10,292
did not create all of us equal.

394
00:40:11,857 --> 00:40:13,529
But as soon as they are baptised.

395
00:40:14,457 --> 00:40:16,493
They are all equal in his eyes:

396
00:40:17,337 --> 00:40:19,851
Black or white, big or small.

397
00:40:20,097 --> 00:40:23,885
But of those that are baptised some
go to heaven and others to hell.

398
00:40:25,977 --> 00:40:28,935
So children,
who can give me an example...

399
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:31,288
of differences between people?

400
00:40:33,217 --> 00:40:34,809
Laurel and Hardy!

401
00:40:37,337 --> 00:40:39,089
The Russians and the Americans!

402
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:42,735
What's the difference?

403
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:47,089
The Russians are nasty.
The Americans are nice!

404
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:48,645
Who says that?

405
00:40:49,537 --> 00:40:50,686
My Papa!

406
00:40:54,057 --> 00:40:57,049
Next week we'll carry on from there.

407
00:40:57,257 --> 00:40:59,168
Goodbye, Sir.

408
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,649
Good afternoon, Sir.

409
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:28,853
Just wait till you get home!

410
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:36,770
This is pure smut!

411
00:41:38,217 --> 00:41:38,967
Sit down.

412
00:41:39,257 --> 00:41:40,849
If we wish someone ill,

413
00:41:41,057 --> 00:41:43,287
we meet at this grave.

414
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:46,806
Mecki is an asshole.

415
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:48,769
Drop dead, Mecki.

416
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:54,492
Go on, Guy.

417
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:56,688
We write his name on the gravestone.

418
00:41:56,937 --> 00:41:58,370
It's like a curse.

419
00:41:58,577 --> 00:42:00,533
And then we concentrate.

420
00:42:00,777 --> 00:42:02,927
The devil take you.

421
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:05,373
And then he can teach cheeky...

422
00:42:05,617 --> 00:42:07,653
little devils in hell.

423
00:42:12,337 --> 00:42:15,534
He was dust,
and to dust he will return.

424
00:42:53,097 --> 00:42:54,166
You first.

425
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:01,453
Your turn.

426
00:43:02,577 --> 00:43:04,454
One of you stole something.

427
00:43:05,097 --> 00:43:06,974
The question is: Who?

428
00:43:08,697 --> 00:43:10,210
If you tell me who it was,

429
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:11,816
I'll leave you alone.

430
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:14,407
And?

431
00:43:14,857 --> 00:43:15,926
Who was it?

432
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:21,174
Me. Now we can go...

433
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:22,247
You?

434
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,848
Since when do Jesus's little children steal?

435
00:43:25,297 --> 00:43:26,855
You're not capable of stealing.

436
00:43:28,097 --> 00:43:29,325
Listen here,

437
00:43:29,697 --> 00:43:31,847
I'm going to search just one of you.

438
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:34,372
Wonder if I can guess the right one.

439
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,136
Bad luck.

440
00:43:54,057 --> 00:43:56,696
Here half for you and half for me.

441
00:44:02,297 --> 00:44:04,208
I've got tickets for the cinema.

442
00:44:04,497 --> 00:44:06,055
Do you want to come with me?

443
00:44:30,897 --> 00:44:31,773
Hello.

444
00:44:37,377 --> 00:44:38,935
Who are those wops?

445
00:44:39,617 --> 00:44:41,733
That's Pinato, my Papa rents to him.

446
00:44:41,937 --> 00:44:44,292
Don't you think he looks like a gangster?

447
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:47,577
Gangster?
He works at the blast furnace.

448
00:44:48,497 --> 00:44:52,456
Well, he looks like the murderer
from Furnace Street.

449
00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:53,517
Look.

450
00:44:53,697 --> 00:44:55,289
He has the same moustache.

451
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:02,571
Let's go, or we'll miss the film.

452
00:45:21,217 --> 00:45:23,094
Exactly the same moustache,

453
00:45:23,977 --> 00:45:25,012
slim.

454
00:45:25,257 --> 00:45:28,329
Maybe the "P" in Papa's
notebook means "Pinato"?

455
00:45:28,577 --> 00:45:31,649
The police are looking for
the suspected murderer.

456
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:34,537
Witnesses are requested...

457
00:45:34,777 --> 00:45:37,928
to contact the Esch-sur-Alzette police.

458
00:45:44,377 --> 00:45:46,845
Maybe Papa also has his suspicions,

459
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,975
but why doesn't he go to the police then?

460
00:46:18,457 --> 00:46:19,412
Make a note.

461
00:46:19,617 --> 00:46:23,246
The suspect left the house at 13:34.

462
00:46:27,897 --> 00:46:29,250
13:34?

463
00:46:29,777 --> 00:46:31,608
We're going to be late for school!

464
00:46:31,817 --> 00:46:33,853
We'll catch him and we'll be on television.

465
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,888
We don't even know if it really was him.

466
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:38,088
Of course it was.
You saw the sketch.

467
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,328
And then "P," for Pinato.

468
00:46:40,617 --> 00:46:42,847
Even your father knows it was him.

469
00:46:43,537 --> 00:46:44,731
Let's go.

470
00:46:48,977 --> 00:46:51,207
Children of Esch.
Please pay attention...

471
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:56,207
The Esch Business Association is holding
a writing competition for children.

472
00:46:56,457 --> 00:47:00,609
This is the final announcement.
There is still time to take part.

473
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,967
The story should be no longer than 3 pages.

474
00:47:03,297 --> 00:47:05,333
Send it in by March 31st...

475
00:47:05,537 --> 00:47:07,414
to the Esch Business Association.

476
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:10,927
Here is Radio Luxembourg, VHF 92.5...

477
00:47:11,337 --> 00:47:12,736
channel 18.

478
00:47:39,097 --> 00:47:40,291
We have to spy on him.

479
00:47:41,457 --> 00:47:43,015
Then we'll tell the police everything.

480
00:47:43,217 --> 00:47:45,048
Then we'll get a medal.

481
00:48:03,737 --> 00:48:04,886
That's my sister!

482
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:36,932
Josette!
Papa's coming!

483
00:48:37,857 --> 00:48:38,972
Quick!

484
00:49:05,857 --> 00:49:07,495
That was close.

485
00:49:09,337 --> 00:49:11,373
If you say anything to Papa,
I'll kill you!

486
00:49:11,897 --> 00:49:15,651
- He would have caught you but for me.
- I'm fed up with him spying on me.

487
00:49:15,857 --> 00:49:18,132
- Spying?
- Don't pretend to be stupid.

488
00:49:18,337 --> 00:49:21,135
You think it just a coincidence
he was cycling there this afternoon?

489
00:49:21,377 --> 00:49:22,810
- This afternoon?
- Yes.

490
00:49:23,017 --> 00:49:24,689
Stop repeating everything.

491
00:49:26,017 --> 00:49:29,646
He creeps around all the time,
when he thinks I'm with Gust.

492
00:49:30,417 --> 00:49:32,089
What were you doing there anyway?

493
00:49:32,297 --> 00:49:34,367
- He's called Gust?
- I've just said that.

494
00:49:34,577 --> 00:49:38,013
He lives just across
from the murder victim.

495
00:49:38,337 --> 00:49:39,850
Did he see anything?

496
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:43,850
Is he called Gust Pfeiffer?

497
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:45,126
No, Tendler.

498
00:49:45,377 --> 00:49:47,015
- Pendler?
- Tendler!

499
00:49:48,497 --> 00:49:50,692
What does Papa do
when he's spying on you?

500
00:49:51,097 --> 00:49:53,247
He makes a fool of himself, that's all.

501
00:49:53,737 --> 00:49:55,728
But this afternoon it was very close.

502
00:49:57,337 --> 00:50:01,455
- Is that why you never speak to Papa?
- If you were a girl you'd understand it.

503
00:50:02,297 --> 00:50:04,857
You don't know what's going on.
And you're on his side too.

504
00:50:05,057 --> 00:50:07,571
I'm not allowed to do anything.
I'm not allowed to go anywhere.

505
00:50:07,777 --> 00:50:09,813
I have to do everything in secret.

506
00:50:10,297 --> 00:50:11,810
Say nothing!

507
00:50:12,057 --> 00:50:13,285
I swear.

508
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:15,246
You better.

509
00:50:17,577 --> 00:50:18,646
Who's that?

510
00:50:18,857 --> 00:50:20,370
- You don't know?
- No.

511
00:50:20,577 --> 00:50:23,171
That's the Sharks.
A group from Luxembourg.

512
00:50:25,537 --> 00:50:26,811
Do you know them?

513
00:50:27,017 --> 00:50:29,247
That's the Beatles. They're great!

514
00:50:30,217 --> 00:50:31,935
And off to the barber.

515
00:51:23,577 --> 00:51:24,487
Norbi...

516
00:51:24,937 --> 00:51:26,529
You're 12 years old now.

517
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:29,055
It's time we told you.

518
00:51:35,137 --> 00:51:36,536
Your willy...

519
00:51:37,897 --> 00:51:41,173
you've certainly noticed.
That it gets harder sometimes.

520
00:51:42,537 --> 00:51:44,812
Do you know why it gets harder?

521
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:48,896
It gets stiff.

522
00:51:49,257 --> 00:51:51,009
That's what happens to boys.

523
00:51:51,217 --> 00:51:52,730
They get a hard-on...

524
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,056
Listen to your mother.

525
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:02,127
To conceive a child,

526
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:06,850
Papa and Mama have to
love each other a lot.

527
00:52:08,137 --> 00:52:10,856
Then Papa's willy gets stiff...

528
00:52:11,937 --> 00:52:13,450
and then...

529
00:52:14,057 --> 00:52:14,933
Irène,

530
00:52:15,857 --> 00:52:16,573
That's enough

531
00:52:16,817 --> 00:52:18,330
Am I saying something wrong?

532
00:52:18,537 --> 00:52:21,734
- We'll talk about it after mass.
- Do you want to carry on?

533
00:52:22,257 --> 00:52:23,133
So,

534
00:52:23,697 --> 00:52:25,688
when Papa and Mama...

535
00:52:26,937 --> 00:52:29,053
Love each other,

536
00:52:29,457 --> 00:52:31,334
hug each other tight,

537
00:52:32,297 --> 00:52:34,936
and then Papa put his willy...

538
00:52:35,177 --> 00:52:37,293
in the woman's vagina.

539
00:52:38,737 --> 00:52:39,931
And then...

540
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:42,847
when they really love each other,

541
00:52:43,057 --> 00:52:44,126
then...

542
00:52:44,417 --> 00:52:47,056
sperm comes out of the penis,

543
00:52:47,537 --> 00:52:49,448
sperm from the testicles...

544
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:52,055
You're just confusing the boy.

545
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:53,776
But everything I said was right.

546
00:52:54,977 --> 00:52:56,171
Just let me do it.

547
00:52:57,697 --> 00:52:59,528
Millions of little sperms...

548
00:53:00,297 --> 00:53:04,848
and when one of these little sperms
meets an egg cell... just imagine...

549
00:53:05,497 --> 00:53:07,294
Just one little sperm is enough...

550
00:53:08,257 --> 00:53:09,736
to make a child!

551
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:14,855
My Papa is saved at last.

552
00:53:15,497 --> 00:53:17,931
And off to the confessional.

553
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,086
Get up now.

554
00:53:32,057 --> 00:53:33,206
Go. Jängi.

555
00:53:37,017 --> 00:53:38,609
Germany! Germany!

556
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:42,055
Don't you know them?

557
00:53:42,297 --> 00:53:45,095
- They live in Canal Street.
- I've seen the boy.

558
00:53:45,297 --> 00:53:47,288
Mrs. Schaul told me her husband died in '46.

559
00:53:47,497 --> 00:53:50,858
Nobody mourned him, during
the war he was a Nazi...

560
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,091
- You can say it out loud.
- Yes, but the poor woman.

561
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:54,969
Go Luxembourg!

562
00:53:57,097 --> 00:53:58,735
Germany! Germany!

563
00:53:58,977 --> 00:54:00,092
Shut up, you with your Krauts!

564
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:01,117
Fucking Wop!

565
00:54:01,497 --> 00:54:03,010
Bloody Germans! Bloody Krauts!

566
00:54:03,257 --> 00:54:05,532
Ebert is head and shoulder above them all!

567
00:54:05,737 --> 00:54:08,490
- That's what the Nazis thought too!
- Who's a Nazi here?

568
00:54:08,697 --> 00:54:09,527
Bloody yellow shirt!

569
00:54:10,057 --> 00:54:11,456
Collaborator!

570
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:14,806
Separate!

571
00:54:22,057 --> 00:54:24,093
Watch where you're walking!

572
00:54:46,017 --> 00:54:47,416
Good afternoon, Mr Welscheid.

573
00:54:48,857 --> 00:54:49,846
Be careful!

574
00:54:50,057 --> 00:54:50,773
Hello, Norbert.

575
00:54:54,097 --> 00:54:55,007
Oh. No.

576
00:54:55,817 --> 00:54:57,250
The 'P' is missing.

577
00:54:57,457 --> 00:54:58,970
You wouldn't believe how expensive it was.

578
00:54:59,537 --> 00:55:00,686
What happened?

579
00:55:00,937 --> 00:55:01,926
I don't know.

580
00:55:02,617 --> 00:55:04,175
I just noticed it

581
00:55:05,337 --> 00:55:06,247
Well, bless me.

582
00:55:06,697 --> 00:55:07,686
Come in.

583
00:55:09,617 --> 00:55:11,494
Irène!
Come and sweep up!

584
00:55:14,457 --> 00:55:16,448
Is this a warning from "P"?

585
00:55:21,337 --> 00:55:23,407
People here don't buy anything expensive.

586
00:55:23,617 --> 00:55:25,733
Yes, but this model is very good value.

587
00:55:26,297 --> 00:55:28,333
How are you, Norbert?

588
00:55:33,537 --> 00:55:35,289
Do you like it?

589
00:55:35,937 --> 00:55:36,972
Norbi!

590
00:55:38,497 --> 00:55:39,691
Yeah, before I forget,

591
00:55:39,897 --> 00:55:42,536
I have a few new machines in the car.

592
00:55:42,737 --> 00:55:44,887
I'll go and get one. Just a minute.

593
00:55:51,457 --> 00:55:53,015
Is his name Paschulke?

594
00:55:55,657 --> 00:55:56,851
Heinz Paschulke.

595
00:55:57,897 --> 00:55:59,296
A real Kraut name.

596
00:56:00,617 --> 00:56:02,812
Why does he always call me Norbert?

597
00:56:03,817 --> 00:56:05,250
He does it on purpose.

598
00:56:05,897 --> 00:56:08,616
During the war they would
have called you Norbert.

599
00:56:08,817 --> 00:56:10,728
The Krauts. Norbert!

600
00:56:12,257 --> 00:56:14,088
Why do you always say "the Krauts"?

601
00:56:14,297 --> 00:56:15,969
Because they are Krauts, my boy!

602
00:56:17,177 --> 00:56:18,974
They called me "Eugen."

603
00:56:19,177 --> 00:56:20,815
And your mother "Irene."

604
00:56:22,257 --> 00:56:23,292
Why?

605
00:56:23,537 --> 00:56:26,370
They wanted everyone to speak German.

606
00:57:16,217 --> 00:57:17,366
Can I come in?

607
00:57:35,137 --> 00:57:39,608
During the war everybody sat in the
cellar and secretly listened to the BBC.

608
00:57:42,457 --> 00:57:44,573
If the Gestapo found them out.

609
00:57:44,777 --> 00:57:46,176
They were taken away.

610
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:50,967
"Don't you want to join the army?
Are you a German? Yes or no?"

611
00:57:51,697 --> 00:57:53,449
"No!" - One finger less!

612
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:57,447
"No!" - Another finger gone!

613
00:57:58,857 --> 00:58:00,848
Stop it! What do you think you're doing?

614
00:58:01,337 --> 00:58:04,534
In half an hour we'll be at the border!
Then the guide will come.

615
00:58:05,017 --> 00:58:06,291
What guide?

616
00:58:06,977 --> 00:58:08,888
- The one who knows the way.
- What way?

617
00:58:09,297 --> 00:58:11,049
The way to escape. Across the border

618
00:58:11,257 --> 00:58:14,010
- We are conscientious objectors.
- What?

619
00:58:14,197 --> 00:58:15,034
We're in the Resistance!

620
00:58:15,137 --> 00:58:16,934
We're not yellow shirts.

621
00:58:17,497 --> 00:58:18,976
Yellow shirts?

622
00:58:20,377 --> 00:58:23,449
You should have thought about that earlier.

623
00:58:24,177 --> 00:58:25,132
Let me out!

624
00:58:25,417 --> 00:58:27,931
You stay here.
Otherwise they'll get you.

625
00:58:29,037 --> 00:58:29,737
Traitor!

626
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,447
Yellow shirt!

627
00:58:58,657 --> 00:59:00,852
As soon as he's gone,
the Gestapo will come.

628
00:59:06,617 --> 00:59:07,333
Shit!

629
00:59:07,537 --> 00:59:08,572
I have to get back to the shop.

630
00:59:08,817 --> 00:59:11,251
Or else Fatty Wegener will
deduct an hour off my pay.

631
00:59:21,897 --> 00:59:23,489
Well, Mrs. Lamesch,

632
00:59:24,057 --> 00:59:26,173
Would you like a whole one or a half?

633
00:59:26,457 --> 00:59:29,335
- Give me a whole one.
- A whole one, with pleasure.

634
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:30,687
There you are, Mrs. Lamesch.

635
00:59:31,657 --> 00:59:32,612
Hello, Aloyse.

636
00:59:33,897 --> 00:59:34,613
Here.

637
00:59:34,817 --> 00:59:35,772
Here. Take it.

638
00:59:35,977 --> 00:59:37,376
Goodbye, young man.

639
00:59:42,297 --> 00:59:43,286
So, boys.

640
00:59:45,497 --> 00:59:47,055
- What's your name?
- Aloyse.

641
00:59:47,257 --> 00:59:48,292
Surname?

642
00:59:50,497 --> 00:59:51,566
Do you know him?

643
00:59:52,937 --> 00:59:54,256
Do you know him, yes or no?

644
00:59:58,017 --> 00:59:59,086
What's this?

645
01:00:00,777 --> 01:00:02,335
Why did you do that?

646
01:00:04,737 --> 01:00:07,092
Go home and tell your mother to come here!

647
01:00:07,297 --> 01:00:08,127
She's dead!

648
01:00:11,777 --> 01:00:13,369
Then send your father.

649
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:16,330
My Papa says if I want a car,
I'll have to steal it.

650
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:18,016
Get out of here, smartass!

651
01:00:19,257 --> 01:00:20,849
And don't ever come back.

652
01:00:22,897 --> 01:00:24,888
I really must to talk to your teacher

653
01:00:25,657 --> 01:00:27,375
Isn't he in your class?

654
01:00:28,657 --> 01:00:30,852
I only know that he's called Aloyse.

655
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:56,687
Tell him to give you some.

656
01:01:00,177 --> 01:01:03,089
When was the last time
you were in the cemetery?

657
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:15,810
I should have taken the car.

658
01:01:16,217 --> 01:01:18,447
Aloyse was my friend after all...

659
01:01:18,817 --> 01:01:20,887
and now I've spolled everything.

660
01:01:27,177 --> 01:01:28,974
Now I'm cursed.

661
01:01:29,177 --> 01:01:31,168
It's my Papa's fault.

662
01:01:42,897 --> 01:01:45,650
And? How is our little altar boy?

663
01:01:57,497 --> 01:01:58,646
What's this about?

664
01:01:58,857 --> 01:02:01,132
I haven't done anything.
Leave me alone!

665
01:02:07,897 --> 01:02:10,206
What are you doing? Let me go!

666
01:03:06,897 --> 01:03:08,888
Calm down, calm down. Thank you.

667
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:12,891
His hand got caught in the circular saw.

668
01:03:15,817 --> 01:03:18,968
Furnace Street murderer arrested.

669
01:03:23,737 --> 01:03:26,012
Eugène. He's not to blame.

670
01:03:27,497 --> 01:03:29,488
He has to take care of his things.

671
01:03:31,977 --> 01:03:33,615
And go to the barber.

672
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:37,932
Nonsense.

673
01:03:38,137 --> 01:03:39,616
The "P" of Pinato?

674
01:03:40,217 --> 01:03:42,606
That was a false trail.

675
01:03:43,017 --> 01:03:44,894
If he doesn't come into the equation anymore,

676
01:03:45,097 --> 01:03:47,088
what can the "P" mean?

677
01:03:51,457 --> 01:03:52,936
"P" for Penis.

678
01:03:54,057 --> 01:03:55,490
"P" for Priest.

679
01:03:56,977 --> 01:03:58,695
Pension. Panama.

680
01:04:01,057 --> 01:04:02,092
Palace.

681
01:04:02,697 --> 01:04:04,176
Parrot. Policeman.

682
01:04:04,417 --> 01:04:05,247
Pirate.

683
01:04:05,817 --> 01:04:07,045
Pimple.

684
01:04:08,057 --> 01:04:09,695
Pilot,  Palm tree.

685
01:04:11,137 --> 01:04:12,809
Preacher! Pudding!

686
01:04:13,697 --> 01:04:14,652
Prostate.

687
01:04:15,377 --> 01:04:16,890
Puree. Political.

688
01:04:19,737 --> 01:04:22,695
My Papa always writes a
capital ' P' in his notebook!

689
01:04:23,177 --> 01:04:25,233
You think it has something
to do with the Nazis?

690
01:04:25,633 --> 01:04:27,014
Your Papa is looking
for Nazi politicals?

691
01:04:30,537 --> 01:04:31,731
Do you know one?

692
01:04:32,697 --> 01:04:34,130
Kiss my ass!

693
01:04:36,857 --> 01:04:41,248
Why does Fred act so strange
when he hears "Nazi"?

694
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:21,052
Write!

695
01:05:21,297 --> 01:05:22,013
What?

696
01:05:23,497 --> 01:05:25,135
What should I write?

697
01:05:34,377 --> 01:05:36,049
What is a yellow shirt?

698
01:05:36,257 --> 01:05:37,531
A Nazi collaborator.

699
01:05:38,257 --> 01:05:39,656
Your Papa will understand it.

700
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:41,688
But I don't.

701
01:05:44,257 --> 01:05:45,770
Write your own trash.

702
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:48,847
Do you know why we've moved so often?

703
01:05:49,177 --> 01:05:51,088
They say that my Papa was one.

704
01:05:51,297 --> 01:05:52,855
My mother can't stand hearing it anymore.

705
01:05:53,097 --> 01:05:53,927
A what?

706
01:05:54,137 --> 01:05:56,492
A Luxembourger Nazi!
A collaborator!

707
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:00,654
People like your Papa,
always point a finger at us.

708
01:06:01,617 --> 01:06:03,016
They never stop.

709
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:05,856
He should find out for himself how that is.

710
01:06:27,657 --> 01:06:29,568
Good morning. What's the matter?

711
01:06:31,337 --> 01:06:32,611
What's this?

712
01:06:34,817 --> 01:06:36,166
This can't be.

713
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:38,732
Irène!

714
01:06:40,377 --> 01:06:42,447
Irène!
Come down! Just look at this

715
01:06:49,097 --> 01:06:50,735
Is it supposed to be a joke?

716
01:06:56,817 --> 01:06:58,091
Come inside.

717
01:07:05,737 --> 01:07:07,409
They should be prosecuted, it's a scandal!

718
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:09,932
- You're right!
- You can't do anything!

719
01:07:10,137 --> 01:07:13,686
We won't move away just because
of this scandalous behaviour!

720
01:07:16,257 --> 01:07:17,326
Come here, my boy.

721
01:07:19,177 --> 01:07:21,372
Somebody wants to drag
our names in the dirt.

722
01:07:21,577 --> 01:07:22,771
You don't have to be afraid.

723
01:07:24,057 --> 01:07:25,685
You don't have to be afraid,
we're here.

724
01:07:26,097 --> 01:07:29,055
I'll show them,
what kind of yellow shirt I am.

725
01:07:29,297 --> 01:07:31,652
What kind of Kraut...

726
01:07:31,897 --> 01:07:33,774
Me, a Nazi!

727
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:42,692
My dear boys,

728
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:45,050
if you continue like this,

729
01:07:45,297 --> 01:07:47,445
none of you will pass the entrance exam.

730
01:07:47,565 --> 01:07:49,290
Not one!

731
01:07:51,457 --> 01:07:53,413
You needn't look at me like that.

732
01:07:55,677 --> 01:07:57,568
Then you'll stand their like idiots.

733
01:07:59,137 --> 01:08:00,252
I don't care.

734
01:08:00,617 --> 01:08:02,653
I don't need to go to grammar school.

735
01:08:03,657 --> 01:08:05,488
Don't come crying to me later on,

736
01:08:06,497 --> 01:08:08,852
when you're too stupid,
to do your homework,

737
01:08:09,057 --> 01:08:10,649
and too stupid to learn!

738
01:08:11,297 --> 01:08:12,446
Terrible!

739
01:08:15,777 --> 01:08:17,096
Do you understand?

740
01:08:17,657 --> 01:08:19,136
Yes, Sir.

741
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:21,735
Sit up straight!

742
01:08:24,057 --> 01:08:25,934
Take out your arithmetic books.

743
01:08:42,089 --> 01:08:43,451
Looking for someone?

744
01:08:44,017 --> 01:08:45,336
Is Fred here?

745
01:08:45,457 --> 01:08:48,252
He doesn't work here any more.
You should have come yesterday.

746
01:08:48,497 --> 01:08:49,896
Where is he?

747
01:08:50,177 --> 01:08:52,088
He just said he was moving away.

748
01:08:54,817 --> 01:08:58,173
Do they all think my Papa
was a collaborator now?

749
01:08:58,845 --> 01:09:00,928
And if It was true?

750
01:09:46,337 --> 01:09:47,486
Excuse me.

751
01:09:49,737 --> 01:09:51,375
Isnt my aunt here?

752
01:09:53,097 --> 01:09:56,373
She'll be here in a minute,
she went shopping.

753
01:09:58,497 --> 01:09:59,816
Are you Norbi?

754
01:10:04,177 --> 01:10:06,088
I've seen my sister's too...

755
01:10:07,261 --> 01:10:08,377
Yeah, and...?

756
01:10:09,977 --> 01:10:11,092
You're beautiful...

757
01:10:14,297 --> 01:10:16,015
Are you the new saleswoman?

758
01:10:20,177 --> 01:10:23,487
Do you know what a "yellow shirt" is?

759
01:10:25,097 --> 01:10:28,169
They are Luxembourgers,
who worked for the Nazis.

760
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:30,968
And what happened to them?

761
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:33,567
After the war they were condemned.

762
01:10:35,617 --> 01:10:38,006
And why were they called "yellow shirts?"

763
01:10:39,457 --> 01:10:41,973
I think because they had yellow uniforms.

764
01:10:44,217 --> 01:10:46,731
I think my Papa was a "yellow shirt" too.

765
01:10:52,217 --> 01:10:53,366
Hello, Norbi!

766
01:11:02,857 --> 01:11:04,415
What's the matter with you?

767
01:11:05,217 --> 01:11:07,412
He thinks his Papa was a "yellow shirt."

768
01:11:08,857 --> 01:11:10,051
Don't be silly!

769
01:11:10,257 --> 01:11:11,849
He would have eaten them alive!

770
01:11:12,697 --> 01:11:15,232
Maybe he even did. The old meanie!

771
01:11:20,417 --> 01:11:23,807
I think it's fine to keep
an eye on Josette but...

772
01:11:24,457 --> 01:11:25,606
you overdo it.

773
01:11:26,057 --> 01:11:28,776
- What do you mean?
- You supervise her too much

774
01:11:29,457 --> 01:11:32,925
- Stop it.
- She can't stand you anymore.

775
01:11:33,297 --> 01:11:36,892
She'll just have to stand it.
She'll be grateful to me later.

776
01:11:37,097 --> 01:11:39,053
She is 16 and still too young...

777
01:11:39,257 --> 01:11:43,170
I must know when she ovulates, when
she has her period, and what she does...

778
01:11:43,377 --> 01:11:44,856
At 16 she is still immature.

779
01:11:45,057 --> 01:11:47,487
She hangs around with that character.

780
01:11:47,607 --> 01:11:48,971
It's ridiculous.

781
01:11:49,217 --> 01:11:51,253
She needs help.
She's too young for all that.

782
01:12:02,977 --> 01:12:05,855
I know now what a woman's period is.

783
01:12:10,377 --> 01:12:12,447
- Are you a woman?
- What?

784
01:12:19,617 --> 01:12:21,016
That's nothing to do with you.

785
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:30,015
You're going to be just like Papa.

786
01:12:30,817 --> 01:12:32,887
What's it have to do with Papa?

787
01:12:33,097 --> 01:12:35,531
He keeps a record of
when I have my period.

788
01:12:35,737 --> 01:12:37,967
To find out if I'm pregnant.

789
01:12:38,377 --> 01:12:40,572
All this spying makes me sick.

790
01:12:53,617 --> 01:12:56,051
I'm an Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.

791
01:12:56,657 --> 01:12:59,615
The "P" stands for Period.
Not for Political.

792
01:12:59,937 --> 01:13:04,010
I've been made a fool of by all of them.
By Papa, Josette, Fred,

793
01:13:04,217 --> 01:13:06,048
them and their bloody secrets!

794
01:13:59,057 --> 01:14:00,172
Not too short.

795
01:14:00,377 --> 01:14:01,890
And what does your Papa say?

796
01:14:02,577 --> 01:14:03,407
Nothing.

797
01:14:25,057 --> 01:14:26,456
What did that cost?

798
01:14:27,097 --> 01:14:29,213
35 Francs, as always.

799
01:14:29,737 --> 01:14:30,689
As always...

800
01:14:31,937 --> 01:14:33,290
He didn't cut anything off.

801
01:14:35,657 --> 01:14:37,887
Go on, back to the barber right now!

802
01:14:48,017 --> 01:14:49,575
Good afternoon, Mr. Meyer.

803
01:14:51,217 --> 01:14:52,013
Say 'Hello."

804
01:14:55,577 --> 01:14:57,488
I'm happy you came.

805
01:14:58,317 --> 01:15:03,717
This morning the police were here.
I'm sure they will be able to help us.

806
01:15:03,817 --> 01:15:05,375
It's a very dreadful thing.

807
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:08,571
I thought...

808
01:15:09,257 --> 01:15:11,213
perhaps you could find...

809
01:15:13,337 --> 01:15:14,656
I thought...

810
01:15:14,937 --> 01:15:18,168
maybe you could find the culprit.

811
01:15:22,497 --> 01:15:24,089
It was someone from here.

812
01:15:30,177 --> 01:15:32,054
Is that what your pendulum says?

813
01:15:34,577 --> 01:15:35,726
From Esch?

814
01:15:36,457 --> 01:15:37,606
From this area?

815
01:15:38,937 --> 01:15:40,814
But I know all the people here.

816
01:15:41,217 --> 01:15:43,685
No one would do something so nasty

817
01:15:44,137 --> 01:15:46,128
It was somebody from this house.

818
01:15:46,857 --> 01:15:49,690
Mr. Meyer, only my family
lives in this house.

819
01:15:54,017 --> 01:15:56,895
The pendulum is never wrong,
Mr. Welscheid.

820
01:15:57,337 --> 01:15:58,895
You know that.

821
01:15:59,417 --> 01:16:00,406
Excuse me.

822
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:03,132
It was me.

823
01:16:05,657 --> 01:16:06,612
What was you?

824
01:16:07,297 --> 01:16:09,954
The writing outside.  I did it.

825
01:16:11,617 --> 01:16:13,096
Mr. Welscheid.

826
01:16:13,697 --> 01:16:16,131
I'll leave you alone with your son.

827
01:16:17,697 --> 01:16:18,812
You have to...

828
01:16:19,017 --> 01:16:20,735
sort it out with him.

829
01:16:24,177 --> 01:16:25,053
You?

830
01:16:30,577 --> 01:16:32,249
Where did you get such an idea?

831
01:16:33,377 --> 01:16:35,595
You talk about the Germans.
All the time!

832
01:16:35,715 --> 01:16:37,094
"The Krauts!
The dirty Krauts..."

833
01:16:37,337 --> 01:16:38,895
You call them names all the time.

834
01:16:39,397 --> 01:16:42,768
I can't be friends with Fred,
his father was a yellow shirt!

835
01:16:43,017 --> 01:16:44,814
He can't help it.

836
01:16:46,417 --> 01:16:50,569
You don't know how it is when
everyone points a finger at you.

837
01:16:51,217 --> 01:16:53,412
So now you know.
It was about time.

838
01:16:56,697 --> 01:16:58,854
Who put all that into your head?

839
01:16:59,297 --> 01:17:00,935
It certainly wasn't you.

840
01:17:03,257 --> 01:17:05,566
And I'm not going back to the barber!

841
01:18:08,937 --> 01:18:11,895
If I told the others what
they're missing here,

842
01:18:12,137 --> 01:18:14,367
"All hell would break loose,"
as Papa would say.

843
01:18:14,977 --> 01:18:18,606
Luckily these girls don't have
Papas who spy on them.

844
01:19:18,537 --> 01:19:21,609
Won't you tell us what
your story is about?

845
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:25,847
Listen now to the story from Norbi
Welscheid, who won the first prize.

846
01:19:27,657 --> 01:19:29,409
<i>I'm the son of a businessman.</i>

847
01:19:29,617 --> 01:19:32,609
<i>I place a stool and a table
In our shop window.</i>

848
01:19:32,857 --> 01:19:37,248
<i>I put a typewriter on the table,
and sit down on the stool to write.</i>

849
01:19:37,577 --> 01:19:41,172
<i>But no-one is supposed to notice
that I'm a real person.</i>

850
01:19:41,397 --> 01:19:44,088
<i>I'm a robot, an advertising machine.</i>

851
01:19:44,337 --> 01:19:47,090
<i>I type on the keys,
with imperceptible movements.</i>

852
01:19:47,337 --> 01:19:49,897
<i>I have to sit up straight,</i>

853
01:19:50,137 --> 01:19:51,729
<i>I mustn't move my head.</i>

854
01:19:52,497 --> 01:19:54,886
<i>I mustn't smile or make a face,</i>

855
01:19:55,137 --> 01:19:56,616
<i>or twitch my nose.</i>

856
01:19:57,217 --> 01:19:59,406
<i>My Papa stands inside
the shop and smiles.</i>

857
01:19:59,617 --> 01:20:04,088
<i>He is satisfied, because the robot
makes a good ad for his business.</i>

858
01:20:04,337 --> 01:20:07,647
<i>When I can't stand it on the stool
any more, because I have an itch,</i>

859
01:20:08,217 --> 01:20:10,367
<i>my Papa draws the curtain.</i>

860
01:20:10,577 --> 01:20:13,694
<i>Then I have time to scratch
myself or go to the toilet.</i>

861
01:20:14,777 --> 01:20:18,094
<i>The robot will become an attraction.
People will talk about it...</i>

862
01:20:18,297 --> 01:20:20,857
<i>and jostle one another to look at me.</i>

863
01:20:35,977 --> 01:20:37,330
It was so easy.

864
01:20:37,697 --> 01:20:41,576
I just said "no" once and a fresh
breeze blew through the house.

865
01:20:42,177 --> 01:20:44,645
Someone had to stand up to him.

866
01:20:45,977 --> 01:20:49,652
And then the competition.
Something like that can work wonders.

867
01:20:49,897 --> 01:20:51,933
No one thought I could do it.

868
01:20:55,177 --> 01:20:57,566
I wonder if Fred heard the radio?

869
01:20:57,777 --> 01:21:02,214
I need to find out where he moved to,
even if he did make fun of me...

870
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:04,448
him with his stupid yellow shirts.

871
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:10,651
Tomorrow is the last day of school.
Two months without school!

872
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:12,615
I won't miss it.

873
01:21:12,857 --> 01:21:16,486
You only become wiser
from real life anyway.

874
01:21:44,537 --> 01:21:46,971
We'll go and buy something
for mum's birthday!

875
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:04,008
We wouldn't have believed you could do it.

876
01:22:05,297 --> 01:22:06,525
What are you talking about?

877
01:22:07,457 --> 01:22:08,606
About the shop window.

878
01:22:10,137 --> 01:22:11,411
How do you know about that?

879
01:22:12,137 --> 01:22:14,697
My mother cleans the police offices.

880
01:22:14,897 --> 01:22:16,410
She hears things.

881
01:22:17,697 --> 01:22:20,211
How?
I thought your mother was dead.

882
01:22:22,017 --> 01:22:23,848
Did you really do it alone?

883
01:22:25,377 --> 01:22:27,937
Do you think I always need help?

884
01:22:32,097 --> 01:22:33,371
I've convinced Aloyse...

885
01:22:33,577 --> 01:22:38,048
to leave a little souvenir for our teacher
on the wall of his house.

886
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:42,092
So that he doesn't forget us
over the holidays.

887
01:22:42,937 --> 01:22:44,848
Hurry!
We don't have much time!

888
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:47,624
