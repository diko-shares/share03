1
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:42,013
For the grocer,
another group of coins...

2
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,517
...for Katrin's shoes
to be half-soled.

3
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,951
And Mama would count out the silver.

4
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:50,354
At last, Papa would ask, "Is all?"

5
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,930
Mama would look up then and smile.
"Is good," she'd murmur.

6
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:58,534
"We do not have to go
to the bank."

7
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:01,862
The end.

8
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:27,489
"A novel by Kathryn Hanson."

9
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:39,806
"For as long as I could remember,
the house on the Larkin Street hill...

10
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:42,001
...had been home.

11
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:48,917
Papa and Mama had both
been born in Norway...

12
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,816
...but they came to San Francisco
because Mama's sisters were here.

13
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,082
All of us were born here.

14
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,888
Nels, the oldest and the only boy,
my sister Christine...

15
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:04,159
...and the littlest sister, Dagmar."

16
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:08,564
But first and foremost...

17
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,030
...I remember Mama.

18
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,881
I remember that every Saturday night...

19
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:23,348
...I would sit at my desk
by the attic window...

20
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,956
...and write down in my diary
all my innermost thoughts.

21
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,957
Mama would call out to me
from downstairs.

22
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,722
- Katrin?
- Yes, Mama?

23
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:37,992
Katrin, come. We're waiting.

24
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:41,762
Yes, Mama. I'm coming.

25
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,183
It was like a weekly ritual,
those Saturday nights...

26
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:59,754
...for I remember how Mama would
sit down at the kitchen table...

27
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:04,690
...and count out the money that Papa
had brought home in the little envelope.

28
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:06,294
Katrin?

29
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:08,362
Yes, Mama.

30
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:13,335
Papa called. I called two times
before you answer.

31
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,472
I'm sorry, Mama. I was writing.

32
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:20,209
Christine, you wish to laugh,
please to laugh. No just:

33
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:21,741
Yes, Mama.

34
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:24,106
So now all are here.

35
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,077
Yeah, come then.

36
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:29,241
First, for the landlord.

37
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:32,354
- For the landlord.
- For the landlord.

38
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,116
For the landlord.

39
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,724
Yeah.

40
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:40,087
For the grocer.

41
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:42,322
- For the grocer.
- For the grocer.

42
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:45,365
In all the U.S., no cat was as brave
as Elizabeth.

43
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:49,596
In all the world, no cat was as brave
as Elizabeth.

44
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:54,300
Dagmar, put Elizabeth
onto the back porch.

45
00:04:55,545 --> 00:05:00,642
In heaven or hell, no cat
was as brave as Elizabeth.

46
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:05,851
For Katrin's shoes to be half-soled.

47
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:08,149
- Katrin's shoes.
- My shoes.

48
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:11,225
Katrin's old shoes.

49
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:14,018
For Katrin's shoes.

50
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:18,224
Mama, teacher says, this week,
I'll need a new notebook.

51
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,370
- How much it will be?
- It's a dime.

52
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,064
For the notebook.

53
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:32,278
It's five. Eight. Three.

54
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:34,439
- You don't lose it.
- I won't lose it.

55
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:38,178
- You look out when you blow your nose.
- I'll look out.

56
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:39,685
Is all, Mama?

57
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:42,017
Yeah.

58
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:44,557
Yeah, is all for this week.

59
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:48,163
Is good. We do not have to go
to the bank.

60
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:52,734
Mama. Mama, I'll be graduating
from valley school next month.

61
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:57,339
- Yeah.
- Could I go on to high, you think?

62
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:10,315
- You want to go to high school?
- Well, I'd like to very much...

63
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,351
...if you think I could.

64
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,125
Is good.

65
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:24,289
It'll cost a little money.
Here, I've got it all written down.

66
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:28,399
Books, carfare...

67
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,771
- Will you get the little bank, Katrin?
- Yes, Mama.

68
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,879
The little bank.

69
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:42,142
That was the most important
thing in the whole house.

70
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,879
It was a box we used to keep
for emergencies.

71
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:49,081
The things that came out
of the little bank.

72
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:54,161
Mama was always going to buy herself
a warm coat, when there was enough...

73
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:56,694
...only there never was.

74
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:03,338
It's all there, Mama.
Carfare, clothes, notebooks...

75
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,964
...all things I really need.
I talked it over with Cy Nichols.

76
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,839
- He went to high last year.
- Is good.

77
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,003
Now we see.

78
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:15,917
Is there enough there, Mama?

79
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:19,816
Well, is not much in the little bank
right now.

80
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:23,652
We give to the dentist, you remember,
and for your roller skates.

81
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:26,693
I know, and there's a warm coat
you've been saving for.

82
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:30,560
Well, the coat we can get
another time, but even so, l...

83
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:34,032
You mean Nels can't go to high?

84
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:38,902
Well, is not enough here. We do not
want to have to go to the bank, do we?

85
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:41,373
No, Mama, no.

86
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:56,219
I could work in Dillon's grocery
after school.

87
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,587
Yeah?

88
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,498
Is not enough.

89
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,899
No, is not enough.

90
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:15,302
I'll stop the smoking.
I'll give up the tobacco.

91
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,610
Well, I...

92
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:27,145
I could mind the Maxwell children
Friday night.

93
00:08:27,323 --> 00:08:29,757
Katrin could help me.

94
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:37,427
Is good. Is enough.

95
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,591
We do not have to go to the bank.

96
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,169
- Gee.
- Good.

97
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:52,578
If that's the aunts,
I'm going to my boudoir.

98
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:55,342
- I'm going to my study.
- No. You mustn't run away.

99
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:58,482
- Why, Trina.
- Trina, yeah, and all by herself.

100
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:02,112
- Say good evening to Aunt Trina, children.
- Good evening, Aunt Trina.

101
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,918
Good evening, children.

102
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:06,653
- How well they all look.
- You have a feather boa?

103
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,525
Is new? Beautiful!

104
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:12,394
- It was a present.
- A present? Lars, look.

105
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:16,197
- Trina has a present.
- Yes. Is... Is fine.

106
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:18,932
Jenny and Sigrid
don't come with you, Trina?

107
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:21,975
No. I didn't tell them I was coming.

108
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,477
- I want to talk to you, Martha.
- Well, come in, then.

109
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,681
Sit, and we talk.

110
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,479
- Could we talk alone?
- Alone?

111
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,887
If you wouldn't mind.

112
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:40,051
Children, you leave us alone a little.
I call you.

113
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:42,129
Dagmar, you go with Katrin.

114
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,994
Trina, what is it?

115
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:49,569
Oh, no. No, I can't say it.

116
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:52,071
Why, Trina, what is it?

117
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:55,574
It's something very personal.

118
00:09:56,712 --> 00:10:00,944
No, Lars, you stay here.
We go out on front porch.

119
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:05,816
I like a breath of air. You smoke your pipe.
Be comfortable.

120
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:11,384
So, Trina, now, what is?

121
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,825
Martha, I want to get married.

122
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:18,990
You mean, you want to get married,
or there's someone you want to marry?

123
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:23,229
- Oh, there's someone I want to marry.
- Does he want to marry you?

124
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:24,805
He says he does.

125
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:28,273
- Trina, is wonderful.
- I think it is.

126
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:30,412
Who is?

127
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:34,640
- Mr. Thorkelson.
- From the funeral parlor.

128
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:38,275
Yeah. I know he isn't very handsome...

129
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:42,823
...and it isn't exactly what most people
think a very nice profession, but...

130
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:45,290
- You love him, Trina?
- Yeah.

131
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:47,827
Then is good.

132
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:50,189
Martha...

133
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:51,628
- Martha.
- Yeah?

134
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:54,463
Will you help me tell the others?

135
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:58,937
- Jenny and Sigrid, they do not know?
- No. I was afraid they laugh at me...

136
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:02,839
...but if you tell them...
- Jenny will not like you tell me first.

137
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:06,846
Well, I can't help that. You've got
to tell them not to laugh at me.

138
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:11,316
If they laugh at me,
I'll jump in the bay.

139
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:17,921
Jenny and Sigrid will not laugh, Trina.

140
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,892
- I promise you that.
- Oh, thank you, Martha.

141
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:22,690
Come now.

142
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,766
And Uncle Chris?

143
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,998
Will you talk to him?

144
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:33,903
Well, it is Mr. Thorkelson
who must talk to Uncle Chris.

145
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:37,273
Always it is husband who must
talk to the head of the family.

146
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,143
Yes, I know that, but Uncle Chris
is very frightening.

147
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:44,218
He's so big and black,
and he shouts so...

148
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:47,584
...and Mr. Thorkelson
is kind of timid, really.

149
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:51,249
But Trina, if he's to be your husband...

150
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:54,555
...he must learn not to be timid.

151
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,324
You do not want husband
should be timid.

152
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,266
You are timid. Is not good
when both are timid.

153
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:06,675
No. Jenny and Sigrid I talk to...

154
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:10,744
...but Mr. Thorkelson must go
to Uncle Chris.

155
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:14,940
Martha, look. Is Jenny and Sigrid now.

156
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:21,116
I see Jenny and Sigrid first.

157
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,624
You go into my bedroom.
Wait there till I call you.

158
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,623
Lars, Jenny and Sigrid come.

159
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,631
No, no, I like you stay a little.

160
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:44,338
Wait!

161
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,076
Oh, wait, Jenny. I must get my breath.

162
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:53,515
- This hill kills me every time I climb it.
- You climb bigger hills than that...

163
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:58,717
...in the old country.
- Well, I was a girl in the old country.

164
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:04,326
- Hello, Martha.
- Jenny, Sigrid, Arne.

165
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,991
- Is surprise.
- Good evening, Aunt Martha.

166
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,899
Good evening, Arne.

167
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,778
- Has Trina been here?
- Trina?

168
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:22,975
She's gone somewhere, and she
doesn't know anyone but you.

169
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:25,746
That is what you think.

170
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:29,454
Give Lars your coat.
I give you some coffee...

171
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:33,925
...then we talk about Trina.
Arne, the children are upstairs.

172
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:36,826
That's good, Aunt Martha.

173
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:42,830
- Can I play with this, Aunt Martha?
- Yeah, sure, Arne, but you don't break it.

174
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:51,140
- Trina has been here.
- Yeah, she has been here.

175
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:55,613
- What did Trina want?
- She want to talk to me.

176
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:57,718
What about?

177
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,445
Marriage.

178
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:03,456
- What?
- Trina wants to get married.

179
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:06,060
Who'd want to marry Trina?

180
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:08,595
Mr. Thorkelson.

181
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:11,996
- Peter Thorkelson?
- Yeah.

182
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:16,831
Timid Peter? She'd be the laughingstock.

183
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,673
Jenny.

184
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,613
Jen...! Sigrid!

185
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:33,851
Trina is here.

186
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:37,481
She will come in in a minute.
This is serious for her.

187
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,494
- You will not laugh at her.
- I shall do what I please.

188
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:43,689
No, Jenny. You will not.

189
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:47,427
- And why won't I?
- Because I will not let you.

190
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:51,937
- And how will you stop me?
- Lf you laugh at Trina...

191
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:55,042
...I will tell of the time
before your wedding...

192
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,338
...when your husband tried to run away.

193
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:01,210
- What is that?
- Who told you that?

194
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:03,374
I know.

195
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,144
Erik tried to run away?

196
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,885
- It is not true.
- Then you do not mind if I tell Trina?

197
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:14,325
Uncle Chris told you.

198
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,399
Tried to run away?

199
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:22,502
It does not matter, Sigrid.

200
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:25,536
Jenny will not laugh at Trina, no.

201
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,507
Nor will you.

202
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:34,909
For if you laugh at her, I will tell
of your wedding night with Ole...

203
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:40,681
...when you cry all the time,
and he bring you home to mother.

204
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:48,995
- That I did not know.
- Is no need you should know.

205
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:52,497
I do not tell these stories for spite...

206
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:55,000
...only so they do not laugh at Trina.

207
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,798
You go call her now, Lars.

208
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:03,634
Come have some coffee. Jenny. Sigrid.

209
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:07,213
- Trina!
- Yeah, I'm coming.

210
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,454
Oh, I beg your pardon. I was not aware...

211
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:23,894
Oh, Mr. Hyde, these are my sisters.

212
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,766
- Pleased to meet you.
- Madame. Madame.

213
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:31,638
The three Graces.

214
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:36,840
- I shall be in my room.
- Yeah, sure, Mr. Hyde.

215
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:46,282
- Has he paid you his rent yet?
- Well, is hard to ask. Surely he'll pay soon.

216
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:51,290
Surely he won't. If Martha thinks she'll
get the warm coat she always talks about...

217
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:55,554
...out of that old broken-down actor...
- Jenny, Mr. Hyde is a gentleman.

218
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:59,064
He reads to us loud wonderful books.

219
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:04,194
Longfellow and Charles Dickens
and Fenimore Kipling.

220
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,868
Oh, come. Come in, Trina.
Come. Coffee's getting cold.

221
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,879
- I tell them.
- Why did you come to Martha first?

222
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:23,286
She think maybe
Martha would understand.

223
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:26,620
Maybe Mr. Thorkelson thinks
she will have dowry...

224
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,320
...like the girls in the old country.
- Sigrid.

225
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:32,160
Well, why shouldn't I?
You all had dowries.

226
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:35,701
We were married in Norway,
and our parents were alive.

227
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:38,533
Where would your dowry
come from, I'd like to know?

228
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:42,108
- Uncle Chris. He's head of the family.
- And who will ask him?

229
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:44,810
He won't need asking
when Mr. Thorkelson...

230
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:47,880
Uncle Chris will eat him.

231
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:51,018
Timid Peter and Uncle Chris.

232
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:54,747
Maybe Uncle Chris will tell
him some family stories.

233
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:57,858
He knows many, does Uncle Chris.

234
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:01,427
- Where are the children?
- Yes, aren't we going to see them?

235
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,099
Yeah, sure. I'll call them.

236
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,369
- Children! Your aunts are leaving!
- Coming, Papa.

237
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,970
I help with the coffee things.

238
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:18,003
Is all right.

239
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,670
Here they come.

240
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:26,084
Good evening, Aunt Jenny, Aunt Sigrid.

241
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:30,781
Good evening. Where have you all been
hiding yourselves?

242
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,761
- Good evening, Nels.
- Good evening.

243
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:36,329
My, my, my, how tall he's getting.

244
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:39,058
Yeah, he's almost as tall as his Papa.

245
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,369
Looks to me as if he's
outgrowing his strength.

246
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,066
Dagmar is looking pale too.

247
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:50,639
Oh, my goodness!
What an awful-looking cat!

248
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:54,646
- She follows Dagmar everywhere.
- Next, she'll have it sleeping with her.

249
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,718
Don't you know a cat draws breath
from a sleeping child?

250
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,684
You wouldn't want to wake up
smothered, would you?

251
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,858
Elizabeth can have all my breath.

252
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,654
- There.
- Elizabeth.

253
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,164
- What a very silly name for a cat.
- It's a very silly name for that cat.

254
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:15,269
- That cat's a tom...
- Nels, you do not need to say it.

255
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,267
She better think up a new name.

256
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:20,840
He's Elizabeth, and he's gonna
stay Elizabeth.

257
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:24,069
Well, maybe you would call him
Uncle Elizabeth.

258
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,612
Uncle Elizabeth?

259
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:29,182
- Elizabeth, do you hear?
- Goodbye, all.

260
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:33,981
- Come on, sweetheart.
- You're called Uncle Elizabeth now.

261
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:37,892
Nels, go tell Mr. Hyde
we're ready for the reading.

262
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:40,386
You mind what I say, Martha.

263
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:44,498
It'd be a great pity if a boarder put
something over on a Norwegian woman.

264
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:48,864
Would be great pity if boarder put
something over on San Francisco woman.

265
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:51,665
You talk as if San Francisco
were the world.

266
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:55,105
Yeah, is my world.
Goodbye, Jenny, Sigrid.

267
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,870
- Goodbye, Martha.
- Goodbye, Aunt Martha.

268
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:00,981
Goodbye, Arne, sweetheart.

269
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:15,495
Oh, Mr. Hyde, this is my sister Trina.

270
00:20:15,664 --> 00:20:17,131
Enchanted.

271
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,535
Mr. Hyde reads to us tonight
the Tales From Two Cities.

272
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:25,036
It's a beautiful story, but sad.

273
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:27,368
I like sad stories.

274
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:32,206
I should like to finish this tonight.

275
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,349
Is good.

276
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,849
- Are you ready?
- Yes, please, Mr. Hyde.

277
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:42,448
Yeah, Mr. Hyde.

278
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:46,759
"In the black prison of the Conciergerie...

279
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:49,955
...the doomed of the day awaited their fate.

280
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:54,958
They were in numbers
the weeks of the year.

281
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:59,597
Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon
on the life-tide of the city...

282
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,768
...to the boundless everlasting sea."

283
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:06,779
I don't think I shall ever
forget that night.

284
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:09,611
It was almost midnight
when he came to the end...

285
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:12,686
...and none of us had noticed.

286
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:20,794
"It is a far, far better thing I do...

287
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:23,363
...than I have ever done.

288
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:29,062
It is a far, far better rest I go to...

289
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:31,933
...than I have ever known."

290
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,949
The end.

291
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:50,484
There were many nights
I couldn't sleep...

292
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:53,526
...for the way Mr. Hyde had
set my imagination dancing.

293
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:57,426
I wrote in my diary, "What a
wonderful thing is literature...

294
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,090
...transporting us to realms unknown. "

295
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:03,101
"His voice sank almost
to a whisper as he answered."

296
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,474
"'Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints...

297
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:13,045
...of a gigantic hound."'

298
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,682
To be continued in our next.

299
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:21,485
- Lf you're interested.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Hyde.

300
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:26,855
If we were interested? You couldn't
have kept us from it.

301
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:30,696
It meant a lot to Mama too,
because Nels stopped going nights...

302
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:34,267
...to the street corner to hang about
with the neighborhood boys.

303
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,496
The night they broke
into Mr. Dillon's store...

304
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:39,401
...Nels was home with us.

305
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:45,103
This above all: to thine own self be true.

306
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,805
And it must follow, as the night the day...

307
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:53,421
...thou canst not then be false to any man.

308
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:02,057
The more Mr. Hyde read,
the more I realized...

309
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,894
...that the one thing I really wanted
in all the world was to become a writer.

310
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:10,004
I did write a piece once
about Mama's Uncle Chris...

311
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:13,039
...but my schoolteacher said
it wasn't nice to write...

312
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,507
...about a member of one's own family.

313
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:24,248
Once or twice a year...

314
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:27,877
...our Uncle Chris, with his great,
loud voice...

315
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:30,251
...with his fierce black mustache...

316
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:33,019
...would come down
from his ranch in the north...

317
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:37,598
...and descend upon San Francisco
in his automobile.

318
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:52,303
We knew that from the time
he roared off the ferry...

319
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:56,440
...and charged up Market Street
to get a good run up the hill...

320
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:59,746
...our quiet way of life
was due for a change.

321
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:01,889
Uncle Chris.

322
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:07,118
Uncle Chris.

323
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:17,098
We children didn't talk much about him...

324
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:21,675
...but Mama used to say that the reason
Uncle Chris drove so fast...

325
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:26,007
...was that it gave him a feeling of
freedom denied him when he walked.

326
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:32,279
For Uncle Chris limped badly because
of an accident back in the old country.

327
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:36,947
Martha!

328
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,624
Lars! Children, where are you?

329
00:24:41,796 --> 00:24:44,424
Martha! Lars!

330
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:47,830
Well, hey, there is nobody home?

331
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:52,735
I say, is nobody home?

332
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,175
So, what is?

333
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:06,181
You do not answer me?
You do not hear me calling?

334
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:09,448
I say, you do not hear me calling?

335
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:13,253
I do not call loud enough?

336
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:28,203
Christine!

337
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,978
Yes, Uncle Chris.

338
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:52,496
Katrin!

339
00:25:57,872 --> 00:26:01,308
Nels.

340
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:04,677
Yes, Uncle Chris.

341
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:09,339
Which yes? Yes, you do not hear me,
or yes, I do not call loud enough?

342
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:12,714
- We heard you, Uncle Chris.
- Well, then why you do not come?

343
00:26:12,887 --> 00:26:14,479
We were coming.

344
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,649
Come, let me look at you.

345
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,970
Stand tall.

346
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,335
Where the marks are.

347
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:43,941
Two inches.

348
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:49,483
Two inches in six months is good! Good!

349
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:51,182
Good!

350
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,156
Christine.

351
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:56,521
Show me your teeth.

352
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:58,895
You brush them good?

353
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:03,970
Nels, there's a box of oranges in the
automobile. You fetch them in.

354
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:08,435
Where is the little one? Dagmar?

355
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,807
- She's sick, Uncle Chris.
- Sick? What is the matter with her?

356
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,313
It's her ear. She's had an earache
for two days. A bad earache.

357
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:19,283
- Mama sent for the doctor.
- Good doctor? What he say?

358
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:22,389
- He's in there now.
- Oh, I go in.

359
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,408
Uncle Chris.

360
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:44,238
- How is with Dagmar?
- Is not good.

361
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:56,984
- Doctor, this is my uncle, Mr. Halvorsen.
- How do you do, sir?

362
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:58,648
What is with the child?

363
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:02,786
We must get her to a hospital at once.
We'll have to operate.

364
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:06,091
- Operate?
- I'm afraid so.

365
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:14,806
Can wait till my husband
come home from work?

366
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:19,470
I'm afraid not. Her condition
requires an immediate operation.

367
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,016
We go.

368
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,058
- What is with the child?
- It's a mastoid.

369
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:35,594
Oh, well, then you operate immediately.

370
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:39,530
- I believe that's what I said.
- Immediately.

371
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,065
Dr. Johnson.

372
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:53,510
Doctor, is enough?

373
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:56,343
Frankly, I was thinking
of the county hospital.

374
00:28:56,518 --> 00:29:01,217
No. No, we pay. But is enough?

375
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:04,051
If there isn't, we can go to the bank.

376
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:06,591
We have a bank account.

377
00:29:09,564 --> 00:29:12,761
Well, is enough without we go
to the bank, doctor?

378
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:15,334
My husband is carpenter.
Make good money.

379
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:19,098
If there is need of money, I pay.

380
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:22,433
It'll be all right. We'll take her
to the clinic.

381
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,204
- You pay what you can afford.
- Good.

382
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,907
I have patient there already.
My nephew Arne.

383
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,746
They operate this morning on his knee.

384
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:35,282
Are you a physician, sir?

385
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:38,392
I'm better physician than most doctors.

386
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,758
Nels, here, my other nephew,
he become doctor when he grow up.

387
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:44,831
Indeed.

388
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:46,729
Very interesting.

389
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:49,199
If you'll have the child
at the clinic in...

390
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,431
...shall we say an hour's time?
- The child will be there in 1 0 minutes.

391
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:54,870
I have my automobile.

392
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,409
I can hardly make arrangements
in 1 0 minutes.

393
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:00,810
Well, I make arrangements.
I know doctors.

394
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:03,984
Uncle Chris, Dr. Johnson arrange.

395
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:06,620
He is good doctor.

396
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:10,280
Thank you, madam.

397
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:16,029
- Doctor, you go. We come.
- Very well. In an hour, then.

398
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:20,429
Dagmar will be well taken care of.
I promise you. I will operate myself.

399
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:24,436
- I watch.
- You'll do no such thing, sir.

400
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:27,632
Always I watch operation.
I'm head of family.

401
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:31,768
I allow no one to attend my operations.

402
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:35,873
Are so bad?

403
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,217
- I go see Dagmar.
- Uncle Chris.

404
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:47,623
Is kind of you, but Dagmar's sick.

405
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:50,025
You frighten her.

406
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:53,690
- I frighten her?
- Yeah, Uncle Chris, you frighten everyone.

407
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:56,302
- I?
- Yeah, everyone but me.

408
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:59,599
Even the girls, Jenny, Sigrid, Trina,
are frightened of you.

409
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,175
- The girls. Women.
- And the children too.

410
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:07,371
So Nels and I get Dagmar, you drive us
to the hospital in your automobile...

411
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:11,576
...but you do not frighten Dagmar,
and you leave doctor alone.

412
00:31:11,753 --> 00:31:14,586
Dr. Johnson is fine doctor.

413
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:17,088
Nels, you come with me.

414
00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:19,556
Help me carry Dagmar.

415
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:22,019
You remember.

416
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:35,935
Is true I frighten you, huh?

417
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,342
Christine, Katrin,
you are frightened of me?

418
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:44,378
Now, come, I ask you,
tell me the truth.

419
00:31:44,552 --> 00:31:47,419
You are frightened of me?

420
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:51,423
- A little, Uncle Chris.
- Oh, no.

421
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:53,458
Are you, Christine?

422
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:57,587
- Yes, Uncle Chris.
- But why?

423
00:31:57,765 --> 00:31:59,562
What is there to be frightened of?

424
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:02,862
I'm your Uncle Chris.
Why do I frighten you?

425
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:05,267
I don't know.

426
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,277
Is bad. Very bad.

427
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:16,482
The aunts, yes, I like to frighten them.

428
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,592
What? That makes you laugh?

429
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:32,824
You do not like the aunts?

430
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:34,468
Now, come, tell me.

431
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:38,629
You do not like the aunts? Now say.

432
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:40,831
Not very much, Uncle Chris.

433
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:44,501
And which do you not like the most?

434
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:49,173
Jenny, Sigrid or Trina? Tell me.

435
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,650
I think I like Aunt Jenny the least.
She's so bossy.

436
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:56,290
I can't stand Aunt Sigrid.

437
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:59,688
Always whining and complaining.

438
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:16,602
Sigrid, whining.

439
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,207
Jenny, bossy. Is true!

440
00:33:23,284 --> 00:33:27,653
Uncle Chris, black. I'll say he's black.
Black in his heart.

441
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:30,791
- Cursing and swearing.
- He is good to the children.

442
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:33,950
He's good to his bottles.
And that woman he lives with.

443
00:33:34,128 --> 00:33:37,689
- His housekeeper?
- His housekeeper?

444
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:41,460
Oh, there's Peter, waiting. Right on time!

445
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:44,696
Yoo-hoo, Peter! Yoo-hoo!

446
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:58,282
Peter, I'm so glad you weren't
tied down to your business.

447
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,683
As a matter of fact, I was just waiting...

448
00:34:00,855 --> 00:34:03,289
An undertaker's business
can always wait.

449
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,450
Now's a fine chance to ask
Uncle Chris for a dowry.

450
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,720
You must be very firm, Mr. Thorkelson.

451
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:12,024
Yes, ma'am. Very firm, indeed.

452
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,565
Fare, please.

453
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:17,330
Tell him, Sigrid. Tell Mr. Thorkelson
what Uncle Chris has just done.

454
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:20,372
Well, you know my little Arne's knee...

455
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:23,032
...that fall he had two month ago.
- Yeah.

456
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:26,146
The man at the drugstore
said it was only a bruise.

457
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:29,442
But this morning, when I left home
to do the marketing...

458
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:31,608
...who should turn up but Uncle Chris.

459
00:34:31,786 --> 00:34:35,222
But you must not tell your mama
that we talk of them so.

460
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,357
Is secret for us.

461
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:41,120
Now you cannot be frightened anymore
when we have secret.

462
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:46,566
Come.

463
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:55,140
I tell you my secret too.
I do not like the aunts.

464
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:06,419
Oh, Jenny, do you see what I see?

465
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:11,081
- That woman in his automobile.
- How shameful.

466
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,898
- Is the woman his wife?
- Yeah.

467
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:22,627
And no.

468
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:30,607
Uncle Chris.

469
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:34,214
Sigrid has something to say to you.

470
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:43,916
Uncle Chris.

471
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:49,295
- You took Arne to the hospital.
- Sure, I take Arne to the hospital.

472
00:35:49,463 --> 00:35:52,990
Now we take Dagmar to the hospital,
so do not clutter up the place.

473
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:55,658
This is some more of Uncle Chris' doings.

474
00:35:55,837 --> 00:36:00,501
Sigrid, you're a whining old fool,
and you get out of here.

475
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:05,703
No. There has been enough
of these high-handed goings-on.

476
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,008
Jenny, you're a bossy old fool.
And you get out of here too.

477
00:36:09,183 --> 00:36:12,414
And we take Dagmar to the hospital.

478
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:22,255
- You got her good, Nels?
- Yeah.

479
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,127
- Well, we go.
- No, you're going to listen to Sigrid.

480
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,669
Sigrid, if you do not get out of the way
of that door before I count three...

481
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,968
...I throw you out. And Jenny too,
as big as she is.

482
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:38,679
One...

483
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:42,379
...two...

484
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,854
Put her in the back of the car.

485
00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:56,526
Uncle Chris.

486
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:59,894
I want to introduce Mr. Thorkelson.

487
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:03,093
I want you to meet Mr. Thorkelson.

488
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:12,707
Uncle Chris, I want you to meet
Mr. Thorkelson.

489
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:20,846
This is Mr. Thorkelson.
He wants to say...

490
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:23,718
Martha!

491
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:25,756
We go.

492
00:37:26,227 --> 00:37:27,524
He wants to...

493
00:37:31,198 --> 00:37:35,692
Jenny, Sigrid, we go to hospital.

494
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,500
You be good children
till Mama comes home.

495
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,438
Yes, Mama.

496
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,601
Yeah, I come.

497
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:49,045
There's milk in the cooler
and fruit and cookies for your lunch.

498
00:37:49,216 --> 00:37:51,878
We'll be all right, Mama. Don't worry.

499
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,624
I go now.

500
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,524
Oh, Martha. You can't go
in his automobile.

501
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,528
- Why not?
- Martha.

502
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,224
- Yeah, I come.
- We go.

503
00:38:10,404 --> 00:38:13,999
Because she is in it. The woman.

504
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:17,667
So it will kill me or Dagmar
to sit in automobile with her?

505
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:22,214
I have see her. She looks nice woman.

506
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:37,627
Mama.

507
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:52,636
Uncle Chris!

508
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:57,283
Mr. Thorkelson.

509
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,214
Mr. Thorkelson.

510
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:02,481
Thorkelson, come, come.

511
00:39:39,593 --> 00:39:41,857
Mama.

512
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:58,172
But Uncle Chris,
I tell you, I must see him.

513
00:39:58,345 --> 00:40:02,714
You do not understand English?
No visitors for 24 hours.

514
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:05,977
- But you have see him.
- I am no visitor.

515
00:40:06,854 --> 00:40:11,553
- I'm exception.
- Then his mama should be exception too.

516
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:13,488
I will see the doctor.

517
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,755
I seen doctor. I told him
you are not good for Arne.

518
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:18,694
Not good for my own son?

519
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:20,834
No. Not good at all.

520
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,697
You cry over him. I go now.

521
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:27,534
Uncle Chris! Uncle Chris,
I must speak to you.

522
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,938
- I have business.
- Uncle Chris, please.

523
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:33,274
- I wanna get married.
- Well, then get married.

524
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:34,709
Wait!

525
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:37,580
Wait, Uncle Chris.

526
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:40,185
I want to marry Mr. Thorkelson.

527
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,787
Here.

528
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:44,083
Peter, this is Uncle Chris.

529
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:48,592
Uncle Chris, this is Mr. Thorkelson.

530
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:51,754
- So?
- How are you, sir?

531
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:54,699
- Busy.
- Please, Uncle Chris.

532
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:58,665
You want to marry him, marry him.
I have other things to think about.

533
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:01,501
- Then you give your permission?
- Sure, I do.

534
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:04,542
If you want to make a fool of yourself,
I can't stop you.

535
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,680
Thank you, Uncle Chris!

536
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:10,681
- So is all?
- Yeah, I think is all.

537
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:12,876
No!

538
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,850
No?

539
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:18,480
Well, there was a little something else.

540
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:20,422
You see...

541
00:41:20,628 --> 00:41:24,086
Well, Trina mentioned
that in the old country...

542
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:27,757
...it was... It was always usual, and...

543
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:32,634
Well, after all, we are all
from the old country.

544
00:41:32,806 --> 00:41:36,970
Well, that's how it is. That's how it is.

545
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:42,682
Well, sir, what is? What do you want?

546
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:47,287
Well, it was a question...
A question of Trina's...

547
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:49,615
Well, not to mince matters...

548
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,248
...her dowry.

549
00:41:53,861 --> 00:41:55,795
- Her what?
- Dowry.

550
00:41:55,963 --> 00:41:59,228
Her dowry! Oh, so Trina wants dowry.

551
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,028
- She's 42 years old!
- No, Uncle Chris!

552
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:04,194
Husband's not enough,
she wants dowry?

553
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:09,536
Please! This is a hospital,
not a marriage bureau.

554
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:13,137
Come with me into waiting room.

555
00:42:13,314 --> 00:42:15,805
I talk to you about dowry.

556
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:27,824
So did you hear that, Martha?

557
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:30,395
- What?
- Uncle Chris.

558
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:32,725
No, I do not hear.

559
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,993
I wait for doctor.

560
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:41,405
Is two hours since they
take Dagmar to operating room.

561
00:42:41,575 --> 00:42:43,668
More.

562
00:42:43,844 --> 00:42:46,608
Who gives dowry?

563
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,711
Parents.

564
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:55,821
Why? Because they are so glad
they don't have to support...

565
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,482
...their daughter anymore,
they pay money.

566
00:43:04,131 --> 00:43:09,296
I do not support Trina. Why then should
I pay money to have her married?

567
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,928
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

568
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:16,736
You think I let Trina marry a man who won't
take her without dowry?

569
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:20,778
- I never thought of it like that.
- What kind of a man would that be?

570
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:23,314
Well, not a very nice kind of a man.

571
00:43:23,484 --> 00:43:26,920
- Well, are you that kind of a man?
- No, I don't think so.

572
00:43:27,087 --> 00:43:31,148
- Well, then you don't want dowry.
- No, I don't suppose I do.

573
00:43:31,325 --> 00:43:32,815
Good.

574
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:35,626
We'll go next door
and have some coffee.

575
00:43:35,796 --> 00:43:37,457
Sigrid, do you have money?

576
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:40,623
- Yeah, I have little.
- Good, then I treat you.

577
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:43,668
We'll be next door
if you want us, Martha.

578
00:43:43,837 --> 00:43:45,464
Yeah.

579
00:44:37,991 --> 00:44:40,482
- Mrs. Hanson.
- Doctor.

580
00:44:42,463 --> 00:44:44,727
Dagmar's fine. She came
through beautifully.

581
00:44:44,898 --> 00:44:49,267
- She's in bed sleeping off the anesthetic.
- Thank you, doctor.

582
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:53,270
- You're very welcome.
- Is good of you, doctor.

583
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,635
I go to her now.

584
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:57,902
Oh, Mrs. Hanson.

585
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,720
I'm very sorry.

586
00:45:11,892 --> 00:45:15,225
You see, it's against the rules.
But you shall see her tomorrow.

587
00:45:15,396 --> 00:45:17,261
Tomorrow?

588
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:19,490
But, doctor, I promise her.

589
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:23,932
She's so little, she'll be frightened when
she wakes if I do not keep my promise.

590
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:28,598
The nurses will take excellent care
of her. Excellent care.

591
00:45:32,413 --> 00:45:34,540
Now, you mustn't worry.

592
00:45:34,715 --> 00:45:39,084
For the first 24 hours, the clinic patients
are not permitted to have visitors.

593
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,687
The wards must be kept very quiet.

594
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:44,847
I would not make a sound.

595
00:45:46,293 --> 00:45:48,158
I'm very sorry.

596
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,228
Tomorrow.

597
00:45:50,397 --> 00:45:51,955
Nels.

598
00:45:52,132 --> 00:45:55,067
- Sir?
- Tomorrow.

599
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:01,504
But, doctor...

600
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,004
Just a minute.

601
00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:37,804
Whom did you wish to see?

602
00:46:37,978 --> 00:46:40,139
Please, where I can find my daughter?

603
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:42,509
- What name?
- Dagmar.

604
00:46:42,683 --> 00:46:45,675
- Dagmar Hanson.
- I'm afraid you can't see her today.

605
00:46:45,853 --> 00:46:47,946
No visitors for the first 24 hours.

606
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,586
Oh, but I'm not visitor. I'm her mama.

607
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:56,058
I'm sorry, but it's against the rules.

608
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:07,168
- Just one minute, please.
- I'm sorry, but it's against the rules.

609
00:47:08,642 --> 00:47:10,337
Mama.

610
00:47:15,883 --> 00:47:18,875
You can see her tomorrow. They said so.

611
00:47:19,052 --> 00:47:21,714
But I promise her.

612
00:47:24,191 --> 00:47:26,887
What can I tell Papa tonight?

613
00:47:27,794 --> 00:47:30,729
The nurses will look after her.

614
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:35,068
Do you wanna go next door
for some coffee?

615
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:41,404
No, we go home. We have coffee home.

616
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:53,148
Where are the girls?

617
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,851
Shall I make you some coffee?

618
00:47:57,524 --> 00:47:59,754
You said you'd have some
when you got home.

619
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:01,827
Later.

620
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:03,986
First I have to think.

621
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:06,223
I wish you wouldn't worry like this.

622
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,164
Dagmar's all right.
You know she's all right.

623
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:11,270
Is everything all right, Mama?

624
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:12,905
Yeah, is all right.

625
00:48:13,073 --> 00:48:15,303
- You have eaten?
- Yes, Mama.

626
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,308
You drink your milk?

627
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:21,936
- Yes, Mama.
- Yeah, is good.

628
00:48:28,722 --> 00:48:31,782
Mama, is there something the matter?

629
00:48:31,959 --> 00:48:34,894
Mama, Dagmar isn't...

630
00:48:35,062 --> 00:48:38,031
She's not... Mama.

631
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:41,326
No, no. Dagmar's fine.

632
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,231
Always so dramatic.

633
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:48,431
Two hours till Papa come home.

634
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,844
Nels, what is it?
There is something the matter.

635
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,284
They wouldn't let Mama see Dagmar.

636
00:49:02,456 --> 00:49:04,185
It's a rule of the hospital.

637
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,418
And Mama's very worried.

638
00:49:07,594 --> 00:49:10,324
She was talking to me
in Norwegian on the streetcar.

639
00:49:10,497 --> 00:49:14,092
- What are we going to do?
- Don't make a tragedy out of it.

640
00:49:14,267 --> 00:49:18,397
Chris how can you be so callous? Can't you
see that Mama's heart is breaking?

641
00:49:18,572 --> 00:49:22,372
You're always trying to make
everything so dramatic.

642
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,601
You only make things worse for Mama.

643
00:49:24,778 --> 00:49:26,643
Well, it is dramatic.

644
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:29,304
- People's hearts don't actually break.
- They do.

645
00:49:29,483 --> 00:49:30,950
Only in books.

646
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,621
Mama.

647
00:49:42,796 --> 00:49:44,889
What are you going to do?

648
00:49:45,966 --> 00:49:47,957
Scrub the floor.

649
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:05,747
But, Mama, you scrubbed
the floor yesterday.

650
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:09,446
Yeah, well, I scrub it again.

651
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,025
But, Mama.

652
00:50:16,697 --> 00:50:21,134
Comes a time when you got
to get down on your knees.

653
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,002
Now will you believe me?

654
00:50:34,648 --> 00:50:36,912
Mama, I wish you wouldn't do this.

655
00:50:37,084 --> 00:50:38,779
You must be tired.

656
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,648
Let her alone, Nels.

657
00:50:47,227 --> 00:50:49,161
Mama.

658
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:51,194
Mama.

659
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:55,558
What is it, Mama?

660
00:50:56,336 --> 00:50:58,065
What is it?

661
00:50:59,706 --> 00:51:02,641
I think of something.

662
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:11,241
I think I think of something.

663
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:28,231
"And drank real dew out of a crystal goblet.

664
00:51:28,635 --> 00:51:34,699
And helped the stars to play peekaboo."

665
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,569
Uncle Chris?

666
00:52:09,743 --> 00:52:13,907
- Yes, Arne?
- Does it have to hurt like this?

667
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,014
If you want it to be well...

668
00:52:16,183 --> 00:52:20,950
...and not walk always like Uncle Chris,
it does, for little.

669
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,519
Arne, the doctor give you something...

670
00:52:24,691 --> 00:52:26,556
...to make you go to sleep.

671
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:30,890
So maybe if you don't think of pain,
you go to sleep.

672
00:52:34,267 --> 00:52:35,529
Is very bad?

673
00:52:35,702 --> 00:52:38,569
It is, kind of.

674
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:43,539
Arne?

675
00:52:44,611 --> 00:52:47,273
Don't you know any swear words?

676
00:52:47,447 --> 00:52:49,312
What?

677
00:52:50,283 --> 00:52:53,081
Don't you know any swear words?

678
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,313
No, Uncle Chris. Not real ones.

679
00:52:56,489 --> 00:53:00,448
Well, then I tell you two fine ones...

680
00:53:00,627 --> 00:53:03,255
...you use when pain comes again.

681
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,058
I tell you Norwegian swear word.

682
00:53:06,233 --> 00:53:08,030
Is better.

683
00:53:08,235 --> 00:53:12,535
When pain comes again,
you say "dum geit."

684
00:53:14,908 --> 00:53:17,342
It help plenty.

685
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:21,810
I know. I have pain too.
I say it all the time.

686
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,141
And if pain is very bad...

687
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:28,287
...you say "dum geit!"

688
00:53:28,488 --> 00:53:31,389
Just like that. Dum geit!

689
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:35,227
But only if is very bad.

690
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,725
Is bad now?

691
00:53:37,898 --> 00:53:41,334
No, it's a little better, Uncle Chris.

692
00:53:41,501 --> 00:53:43,492
You like I sing some more?

693
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,002
I don't mind.

694
00:53:46,172 --> 00:53:51,508
But maybe something a little,
well, quieter.

695
00:53:54,581 --> 00:53:56,674
Sure, sure.

696
00:54:28,615 --> 00:54:30,640
Good!

697
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,749
- It help, huh?
- Is good!

698
00:54:38,658 --> 00:54:40,956
Then you sleep some.

699
00:54:46,433 --> 00:54:50,836
That's terrible. Teaching a child to swear.

700
00:54:53,406 --> 00:54:56,239
You don't know
what "dum geit" means, eh?

701
00:54:56,409 --> 00:54:58,001
Do I look like a foreigner?

702
00:54:58,178 --> 00:55:02,808
If you were, you would know
that "dum geit" in Norwegian means:

703
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:06,350
"Stupid old goat."

704
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:01,307
Is different one.

705
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,795
You're working late, aren't you?

706
00:56:59,966 --> 00:57:01,365
The floors need cleaning.

707
00:57:01,534 --> 00:57:05,231
I'm glad they finally decided
to clean them.

708
00:57:05,405 --> 00:57:07,373
Yeah.

709
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,483
Mama.

710
00:58:36,062 --> 00:58:38,223
Mama.

711
00:58:41,034 --> 00:58:42,865
Mama.

712
00:58:51,477 --> 00:58:52,967
Mama.

713
00:58:55,815 --> 00:58:57,578
Mama.

714
00:59:02,522 --> 00:59:04,183
Dagmar.

715
00:59:04,357 --> 00:59:06,985
Is Mama, Dagmar.

716
00:59:07,894 --> 00:59:10,021
Mama.

717
00:59:13,266 --> 00:59:15,598
There's no fever.

718
00:59:15,768 --> 00:59:17,793
Is good.

719
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:21,668
Where you been? You promised.

720
00:59:21,841 --> 00:59:26,335
Well, yeah, yeah, I promised. I come.

721
00:59:28,014 --> 00:59:29,675
I was worried.

722
00:59:29,882 --> 00:59:33,613
Oh, well, no.

723
00:59:33,786 --> 00:59:37,085
Mama's here now.

724
00:59:37,257 --> 00:59:40,715
Yeah, you go to sleep now.

725
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,168
Sleep.

726
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,741
Sleep.

727
01:03:29,455 --> 01:03:32,652
I don't think I can ever remember
seeing Mama unoccupied.

728
01:03:32,825 --> 01:03:34,690
Her work was never done.

729
01:03:34,861 --> 01:03:37,989
She was always so busy
that it wasn't very often...

730
01:03:38,164 --> 01:03:43,500
...I could get her to talk about herself
or her life in the old country.

731
01:03:43,669 --> 01:03:47,628
I do remember one time, though,
and I felt very proud.

732
01:03:47,807 --> 01:03:51,174
For Mama talked to me just as if
I were a grown-up person.

733
01:03:51,344 --> 01:03:55,110
It was the day before Dagmar
came home from the hospital.

734
01:03:57,049 --> 01:03:59,540
This one's coffee-flavored.

735
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:01,346
Yeah, mine also.

736
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:04,149
Mama, when can I drink coffee?

737
01:04:04,323 --> 01:04:07,349
- When you're grown up.
- When I'm 1 8?

738
01:04:07,527 --> 01:04:09,222
Oh, maybe before that.

739
01:04:09,395 --> 01:04:11,329
When I graduate?

740
01:04:11,497 --> 01:04:16,799
Maybe. Comes the day you are
grown up, Papa and I will know.

741
01:04:21,073 --> 01:04:23,007
Oh, Mama, aren't they beautiful?

742
01:04:23,175 --> 01:04:25,575
Don't you just love flowers?

743
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:27,440
You like we buy some?

744
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:30,275
Oh, Mama, can we afford it?

745
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:34,283
I think for Dagmar's
coming home tomorrow.

746
01:04:34,554 --> 01:04:37,045
We like some violets, please.

747
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:43,356
Ten cents violets, please.

748
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:51,299
Wonderful.

749
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,773
Oh, ladies.

750
01:04:57,243 --> 01:04:59,677
- Thank you, ladies.
- Well, thank you.

751
01:05:00,913 --> 01:05:03,905
Mama, he called us "ladies."

752
01:05:08,254 --> 01:05:12,281
Oh, Mama, when I'm rich and famous,
I'm gonna have fresh flowers every day.

753
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:14,688
I'll buy you just lovely clothes.

754
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:18,626
White satin gowns with long
trains to them. And jewelry.

755
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:23,861
- I'll buy you a pearl necklace.
- Better I like my solje.

756
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:28,931
But, Mama, wouldn't you like to be rich?

757
01:05:29,108 --> 01:05:32,942
I would like to be rich the way
I would like to be 1 0 feet high.

758
01:05:33,112 --> 01:05:36,741
Is good for some things,
bad for others.

759
01:05:39,819 --> 01:05:42,481
But didn't you come to America
to get rich?

760
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:46,182
No, we come to America
because they are all here.

761
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,954
All the others. Is good for families
to be together.

762
01:05:50,129 --> 01:05:54,498
- And did you like it right away?
- Yeah, right away.

763
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:58,330
When we get off the ferry boat
and I see San Francisco...

764
01:05:58,504 --> 01:06:03,066
...and all the family, I say,
"Is like Norway."

765
01:06:03,242 --> 01:06:08,373
And then you're all born here,
and I become American citizen.

766
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:13,382
Mama, do you ever want to go back
to the old country?

767
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:15,816
Well, I like to go back
once to look, maybe.

768
01:06:15,988 --> 01:06:20,152
To see the mountains and the fjords.
I like to show them once to all of you.

769
01:06:20,326 --> 01:06:25,730
Maybe when Dagmar's big, we go back
once one summer. Like tourists. You like?

770
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,933
Here, kitty, kitty.

771
01:06:31,103 --> 01:06:33,264
Here, kitty, kitty.

772
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:38,343
Oh, Uncle Elizabeth.

773
01:06:38,511 --> 01:06:42,277
Could you not wait till Dagmar
comes home to do this?

774
01:06:42,448 --> 01:06:44,678
- Nels, what you think?
- He's pretty bad.

775
01:06:44,884 --> 01:06:48,285
Honestly, I think we should get him
out of here and put him away.

776
01:06:48,454 --> 01:06:50,149
Elizabeth.

777
01:06:57,296 --> 01:06:59,230
Dagmar. Dagmar, wait a minute.

778
01:06:59,398 --> 01:07:04,700
I must tell you, Uncle Elizabeth
is kind of sick.

779
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:07,338
- Sick? What's the matter with him?
- Well, he...

780
01:07:07,506 --> 01:07:11,067
He has been in fight again, last night.
He come home this morning...

781
01:07:11,243 --> 01:07:13,905
...very sick indeed.
- Yeah.

782
01:07:14,714 --> 01:07:16,841
- Dag...
- Dagmar.

783
01:07:22,154 --> 01:07:24,884
Mama, what happened to him?

784
01:07:25,057 --> 01:07:27,821
Oh, Mama.

785
01:07:27,993 --> 01:07:30,826
- He looks awful.
- Yeah, come away, little one.

786
01:07:30,996 --> 01:07:33,556
Nels takes care of him.

787
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:37,227
Listen, Dagmar.

788
01:07:37,403 --> 01:07:39,667
Sweetheart.

789
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:45,800
Would it not be better for poor
Uncle Elizabeth to go quietly to sleep?

790
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:50,176
You mean go to sleep
and never wake up again?

791
01:07:50,349 --> 01:07:51,839
Well, if...

792
01:07:52,017 --> 01:07:55,145
I think he will die anyway.

793
01:07:56,689 --> 01:08:02,150
Mama can make him well.
Mama can do everything.

794
01:08:03,929 --> 01:08:06,329
Make him live, Mama.

795
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,900
Make him well again. Please.

796
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:14,768
Well, we see. Let us see how
he gets through the night.

797
01:08:15,941 --> 01:08:18,637
Now, come on.
You must go upstairs, go to bed.

798
01:08:18,811 --> 01:08:20,779
I bring up your supper.

799
01:08:20,946 --> 01:08:24,643
You will make Uncle Elizabeth
well again.

800
01:08:24,817 --> 01:08:28,981
- Please promise, Mama.
- Well, I promise I try.

801
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:35,524
You say we see how
cat get through the night.

802
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:37,924
I ask you, how do we
get through the night?

803
01:08:38,097 --> 01:08:41,760
It's no use, Martha.
We must put the cat to sleep.

804
01:08:41,934 --> 01:08:44,994
- Mama, it's cruel to keep that cat alive.
- Yeah, I know.

805
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:48,197
Nels, you go to the drugstore
and get something.

806
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,899
- Some chloroform, maybe.
- Chloro...

807
01:08:51,076 --> 01:08:55,206
- How much should I get?
- You tell the man it is for a cat. He knows.

808
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,679
Okay.

809
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:02,685
It's no use, Martha. It's best thing to do.

810
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:06,681
It's just sad homecoming for Dagmar.

811
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:10,693
And she was so good in the hospital too.

812
01:09:27,446 --> 01:09:29,437
- Here you are.
- Thanks, Mr. Schiller.

813
01:09:29,615 --> 01:09:31,014
You're welcome.

814
01:09:54,006 --> 01:09:55,940
Did you see him?

815
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:57,735
Mr. Hyde.

816
01:09:57,910 --> 01:10:01,471
- He must be going for keeps.
- What'll Mama do without a boarder?

817
01:10:01,647 --> 01:10:05,981
- She needs the money.
- I hope he's paid whatever he owes her.

818
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,209
Mama.

819
01:10:10,621 --> 01:10:12,919
- Mama?
- Yeah?

820
01:10:20,298 --> 01:10:23,529
Mama, we saw Mr. Hyde get in
the streetcar with his suitcases.

821
01:10:23,702 --> 01:10:25,762
He left this for you.

822
01:10:28,574 --> 01:10:30,906
Nels, take off your hat.

823
01:10:31,077 --> 01:10:33,739
Christine, close the door.

824
01:10:38,485 --> 01:10:40,510
How much is the check for?

825
01:10:40,687 --> 01:10:43,747
One hundred and thirty dollar.

826
01:10:43,924 --> 01:10:47,383
- Is four months.
- Is good, good.

827
01:10:47,562 --> 01:10:49,120
Is wonderful.

828
01:10:49,297 --> 01:10:51,891
Now we pay doctor everything.

829
01:10:52,067 --> 01:10:55,503
And you can buy your new coat,
your warm coat.

830
01:10:56,871 --> 01:10:59,204
Yes, you can buy your new coat.

831
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:02,538
But there will be no more reading.

832
01:11:02,711 --> 01:11:05,202
What does Mr. Hyde say?

833
01:11:05,381 --> 01:11:08,579
"Dear friends, I find myself compelled...

834
01:11:08,752 --> 01:11:13,451
...to take a somewhat hasty departure
from your house of happiness."

835
01:11:13,623 --> 01:11:15,420
Beautiful letter.

836
01:11:15,592 --> 01:11:19,188
"I am leav... Leaving you my library
for the children."

837
01:11:19,363 --> 01:11:22,890
- He leaves his books?
- Well, he says so.

838
01:11:23,067 --> 01:11:26,093
Nels, is wonderful. Go get the books.

839
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:28,033
What else he say?

840
01:11:28,206 --> 01:11:33,975
"It has been a privilege
to be a part of your happy home.

841
01:11:34,146 --> 01:11:39,049
I shall never forget your kind
hosp... Hospitality."

842
01:11:39,218 --> 01:11:41,710
He signs it Jonathan Hyde.

843
01:11:41,888 --> 01:11:45,881
"Avenue..." Oh, "avenue..."

844
01:11:46,059 --> 01:11:50,689
- Well, here, I think...
- I think it's "vale." "Ava vale."

845
01:11:50,864 --> 01:11:53,595
"Ave Atque Vale."

846
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:56,429
- Is what?
- It means, "hail and farewell."

847
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:59,937
- It's Latin.
- Yes, is Latin, sure.

848
01:12:04,813 --> 01:12:07,509
Gee willikers, look at this.

849
01:12:07,682 --> 01:12:09,946
- Fine.
- The Pickwick Papers.

850
01:12:10,118 --> 01:12:13,555
The Complete Shakespeare.
Alice in Wonderland.

851
01:12:13,723 --> 01:12:17,250
- So much we can learn.
- The Last of the Mohicans.

852
01:12:23,499 --> 01:12:26,367
- You get it, Nels?
- Yeah.

853
01:12:33,343 --> 01:12:34,367
You know how?

854
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:38,345
Well, no. I thought that...

855
01:12:42,954 --> 01:12:47,392
Well, just don't stand there, girls.
Christine, go take Dagmar her tray.

856
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:50,826
Katrin, put the butter
in the cooler for me.

857
01:12:50,996 --> 01:12:54,261
Here, take the jelly too.

858
01:12:54,433 --> 01:12:56,401
Pick up your feet.

859
01:13:03,043 --> 01:13:05,477
Well, take Dagmar her milk.

860
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,147
Lars.

861
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,124
You know how?

862
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:29,732
No, but, well, it shouldn't
be too difficult.

863
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,773
- Lf you hold the cat...
- Me hold the cat?

864
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:35,433
You hold the cat.

865
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:40,341
- Nels...
- No, no.

866
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:43,213
I think it's better if...

867
01:13:43,387 --> 01:13:45,855
If we get a big sponge.

868
01:13:46,023 --> 01:13:49,754
We put it in the box with him
and cover him over.

869
01:13:49,927 --> 01:13:54,058
Nels, you get a sponge, and we
make him ready here in the pantry.

870
01:13:54,232 --> 01:13:55,722
Sure.

871
01:13:57,569 --> 01:14:00,333
- Has he paid you his rent?
- Yeah, sure.

872
01:14:00,505 --> 01:14:02,064
How?

873
01:14:02,241 --> 01:14:05,176
Well, he give me his check.
Lars has it right here.

874
01:14:05,344 --> 01:14:07,574
A check.

875
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:15,447
Jenny, what is it? What is it?

876
01:14:17,724 --> 01:14:21,524
I was at Mr. Kruper's down the street.

877
01:14:21,695 --> 01:14:26,224
Mr. Hyde was there today
having his lunch.

878
01:14:26,401 --> 01:14:29,427
And when he left,
he asked if he would...

879
01:14:29,604 --> 01:14:34,770
...cash a check for him for $50.

880
01:14:34,943 --> 01:14:38,037
- So? So what?
- Well? Go on. Go on.

881
01:14:38,213 --> 01:14:43,446
Mr. Hyde doesn't even have
an account at the bank.

882
01:14:47,624 --> 01:14:51,526
You mean, this check is no good?

883
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:54,357
- No good at all.
- But...

884
01:14:55,098 --> 01:14:57,966
Your Mr. Hyde was a crook.

885
01:14:58,336 --> 01:15:00,804
How much was that check for?

886
01:15:04,809 --> 01:15:08,906
Martha. I bet he owed you plenty,
didn't he?

887
01:15:11,383 --> 01:15:13,681
He owed us nothing.

888
01:15:16,488 --> 01:15:18,252
Nothing.

889
01:15:19,726 --> 01:15:24,026
He pay with far, far better things...

890
01:15:24,197 --> 01:15:26,256
...than money.

891
01:15:29,903 --> 01:15:35,432
I'll bet it must have been $ 1 00
that he rooked you of, wasn't it?

892
01:15:38,779 --> 01:15:42,272
Jenny, I cannot talk to you now.
Maybe you don't have things to do.

893
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:45,442
- I have.
- What have you got that's so important?

894
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:48,953
I have to chloroform a cat!

895
01:16:19,456 --> 01:16:20,946
Kitty.

896
01:16:21,492 --> 01:16:23,358
Elizabeth.

897
01:16:33,706 --> 01:16:36,504
Mama, how's Uncle Elizabeth?

898
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:40,076
Dagmar, why so early?
Why you don't rest?

899
01:16:40,246 --> 01:16:42,180
I wanna see Uncle Elizabeth.

900
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,977
- No, no, Dagmar.
- Dagmar...

901
01:16:45,152 --> 01:16:48,349
Good morning, Papa.
Is Uncle Elizabeth all better?

902
01:16:48,522 --> 01:16:52,424
Dagmar, there is something
I must tell you.

903
01:16:52,592 --> 01:16:54,617
I wanna see Uncle Elizabeth first.

904
01:16:54,796 --> 01:16:56,821
No, Dagmar.

905
01:17:00,234 --> 01:17:03,135
Good morning, my darling Elizabeth.

906
01:17:03,304 --> 01:17:05,637
Are you still asleep, you old sleepy cat?

907
01:17:05,808 --> 01:17:09,266
Lars, do something. Tell her.

908
01:17:09,678 --> 01:17:12,670
Wake up. It's morning.

909
01:17:12,848 --> 01:17:17,786
Well, maybe it's good for her
to think that that cat died by itself.

910
01:17:17,954 --> 01:17:20,582
We cannot tell her lies.

911
01:17:20,757 --> 01:17:22,987
My, what a funny smell.

912
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:25,423
It's like it was in the hospital.

913
01:17:25,595 --> 01:17:29,862
I'll take care of you, Elizabeth,
the way the nurses took care of me.

914
01:17:30,034 --> 01:17:33,731
You'll soon be the wellest cat
in all of San Francisco.

915
01:17:34,672 --> 01:17:39,110
My goodness, you put
enough blankets on him.

916
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:45,416
Did you think he'd catch cold?

917
01:17:54,694 --> 01:17:56,992
Mama, look.

918
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:06,439
Dagmar, let me see.

919
01:18:06,607 --> 01:18:09,542
Let me see that cat.

920
01:18:12,046 --> 01:18:13,877
Here.

921
01:18:16,684 --> 01:18:19,152
Uncle Elizabeth speak to me.

922
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:25,893
It's a miracle.

923
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:29,724
Oh, Mama, I knew you'd make him well.

924
01:18:30,132 --> 01:18:33,864
- Oh, but, Dagmar...
- I'm gonna take him and show him to Nels.

925
01:18:34,037 --> 01:18:36,164
Dagmar, I didn't...

926
01:18:36,339 --> 01:18:38,239
Nels, Christine, look what Mama did!

927
01:18:38,408 --> 01:18:41,741
You didn't give him enough.
You just give him good sleep.

928
01:18:41,912 --> 01:18:43,346
But Lars, we must tell her.

929
01:18:43,514 --> 01:18:47,382
Is not good to let her grow up
believing I can fix everything.

930
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:51,544
Maybe is best thing in the world
for her to believe.

931
01:18:52,223 --> 01:18:56,820
Besides, I know exactly how she feels.

932
01:18:56,995 --> 01:18:59,225
At the time, it seemed like ages.

933
01:18:59,398 --> 01:19:01,559
But now I know that
the days and months...

934
01:19:01,733 --> 01:19:05,101
...went by too fast while we were
growing up and learning.

935
01:19:05,271 --> 01:19:08,468
Graduation day assumed
monumental proportions.

936
01:19:08,641 --> 01:19:10,905
Especially because I was to play Portia...

937
01:19:11,077 --> 01:19:13,875
...in the school production
of The Merchant of Venice.

938
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:17,509
The quality of mercy is not strained.

939
01:19:17,685 --> 01:19:21,052
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven...

940
01:19:21,221 --> 01:19:23,485
...upon the place beneath.

941
01:19:23,657 --> 01:19:25,488
It is twice blest.

942
01:19:25,659 --> 01:19:28,356
It blesseth him that gives
and him that takes.

943
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,498
Him that takes.

944
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:34,157
"It blesseth him that gives and him
that takes." What's after that?

945
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:36,304
- I don't know or care.
- Why, Chris.

946
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,633
I don't. It's all I've heard for weeks.

947
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:42,403
The school play and your graduation,
going on to high...

948
01:19:42,578 --> 01:19:46,241
...never a thought about home. All you
and your friends think about...

949
01:19:46,415 --> 01:19:50,284
...is the presents you'll get.
You make me ashamed of being a girl.

950
01:19:50,454 --> 01:19:53,150
Have you heard about
Thyra's graduation present?

951
01:19:53,323 --> 01:19:55,257
- Hello, Katrin.
- Hello, Madeline.

952
01:19:55,425 --> 01:19:58,827
- What are you getting?
- Well, they haven't actually told me...

953
01:19:58,997 --> 01:20:02,262
...but I think I'm going to get that.

954
01:20:02,433 --> 01:20:03,798
You mean the dresser set?

955
01:20:03,968 --> 01:20:06,266
Your father took it out
so I could touch it.

956
01:20:06,437 --> 01:20:08,905
It's got everything.
Even a hair receiver.

957
01:20:09,073 --> 01:20:11,634
And it's genuine celluloid.

958
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:14,973
- Well, you're not gonna get it.
- How do you know?

959
01:20:15,147 --> 01:20:18,241
- Because I know what you are getting.
- What is it?

960
01:20:18,417 --> 01:20:20,317
Mama's giving you her brooch.

961
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:22,250
Her solje.

962
01:20:22,622 --> 01:20:25,819
That old silver thing she wears
that belonged to grandmother?

963
01:20:25,992 --> 01:20:28,790
What would I want
with an old thing like that for?

964
01:20:28,962 --> 01:20:31,454
It's an heirloom.
Mama thinks a lot of it.

965
01:20:31,632 --> 01:20:33,497
Then she ought to keep it.

966
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:35,931
That's all they're going to give me?

967
01:20:36,103 --> 01:20:39,231
- What more do you want?
- I want the dresser set.

968
01:20:39,407 --> 01:20:43,071
My goodness, if Mama doesn't realize
what's a suitable present...

969
01:20:43,245 --> 01:20:47,579
It's practically the most important
time in a girl's life, when she graduates.

970
01:20:47,749 --> 01:20:51,014
- And you say you're not selfish.
- It's not selfishness.

971
01:20:51,186 --> 01:20:53,018
What else would you call it?

972
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:56,590
With Papa not working,
we need every penny we can get.

973
01:20:56,759 --> 01:20:58,784
Even the little bank's empty.

974
01:20:58,961 --> 01:21:02,192
But you'll devil Mama into giving you
the dresser set somehow.

975
01:21:02,365 --> 01:21:04,891
So why talk about it?

976
01:21:08,305 --> 01:21:11,103
Walk faster if you're
going to walk with me.

977
01:21:14,278 --> 01:21:19,239
Christine was right.
I got the dresser set.

978
01:21:20,118 --> 01:21:24,020
They gave it to me toward the end
of supper on graduation night.

979
01:21:24,189 --> 01:21:27,990
Papa couldn't attend the exercises
because there was a strike meeting...

980
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,890
...to decide about going back to work.

981
01:21:33,532 --> 01:21:37,230
- I'll start the dishes, Mama.
- Yeah, yeah.

982
01:21:37,737 --> 01:21:41,173
We can wash them
when we come home.

983
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:46,708
Katrin, why you don't
eat your rice pudding?

984
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,907
Mama, I couldn't eat. Not now.

985
01:21:50,084 --> 01:21:52,814
Who wants some coffee sugar? Dagmar?

986
01:21:52,987 --> 01:21:55,182
Thank you, Papa.

987
01:21:57,425 --> 01:21:59,121
Katrin?

988
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:00,886
No, Papa.

989
01:22:01,063 --> 01:22:03,327
Katrin, get your coat. You'll need it.

990
01:22:03,499 --> 01:22:05,467
Yes, Mama.

991
01:22:06,401 --> 01:22:09,064
Aunt Jenny says if we drink
black coffee...

992
01:22:09,239 --> 01:22:11,901
...it turn our complexions dark.

993
01:22:12,075 --> 01:22:15,306
I'd like to be a black Norwegian
like Uncle Chris.

994
01:22:15,478 --> 01:22:17,810
I like you better blond, like Mama is.

995
01:22:17,981 --> 01:22:21,679
When do you get old enough
to drink coffee and not turn dark?

996
01:22:21,852 --> 01:22:25,652
Well, one day when you're grown up.

997
01:22:25,823 --> 01:22:27,950
It's the most wonderful
night in my life.

998
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:30,993
Is that black coffee
you dip that sugar in?

999
01:22:31,163 --> 01:22:33,290
You shouldn't. It's not good for them.

1000
01:22:33,465 --> 01:22:34,727
It will turn...

1001
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:36,959
It will turn your complexion black.

1002
01:22:37,135 --> 01:22:39,535
Aunt Jenny, did you
see my graduation present?

1003
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:42,799
Look, it's got a hair receiver.

1004
01:22:42,975 --> 01:22:44,943
But I thought... Martha.

1005
01:22:45,111 --> 01:22:47,909
- Yeah, Jenny, you were right.
- I thought you were...

1006
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:53,075
She's too young to appreciate that.
She likes something more modern.

1007
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:55,285
You're not wearing your solje.

1008
01:22:55,455 --> 01:22:57,980
No, I do not wear it tonight.

1009
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:01,753
- Come on, Trina, we'll be late.
- Oh, but Peter isn't here yet.

1010
01:23:01,929 --> 01:23:03,659
- You like to wait for him?
- Yeah.

1011
01:23:03,865 --> 01:23:07,767
- I hope Katrin knows her part.
- She sure does. I know it too.

1012
01:23:07,936 --> 01:23:10,905
Lars, you be back before us?

1013
01:23:11,072 --> 01:23:15,874
- I don't think the meeting will take that long.
- Is good. All right, now we go.

1014
01:23:16,378 --> 01:23:18,573
Katrin, come.

1015
01:23:19,782 --> 01:23:22,273
- Goodbye, Papa.
- My daughter, I think of you.

1016
01:23:22,451 --> 01:23:25,387
- See you there, Aunt Trina.
- Good luck!

1017
01:23:30,026 --> 01:23:33,018
I knew you would devil Mama
into giving it to you.

1018
01:23:33,196 --> 01:23:34,595
I didn't.

1019
01:23:34,764 --> 01:23:37,029
I showed it to her in
Mr. Schiller's window.

1020
01:23:37,201 --> 01:23:40,568
And made her sell her brooch
her very own mother gave her.

1021
01:23:40,738 --> 01:23:43,229
- What?
- You weren't supposed to tell that.

1022
01:23:43,407 --> 01:23:45,932
I don't care. I think
she ought to know.

1023
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:48,511
Is that true? Did Mama...?

1024
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:51,615
- Nels?
- Well, yes.

1025
01:23:51,783 --> 01:23:54,081
- Come on.
- No, I don't believe it.

1026
01:23:54,253 --> 01:23:56,517
- I'm going to ask Papa.
- You haven't got time.

1027
01:23:56,688 --> 01:23:58,520
I don't care.

1028
01:23:58,691 --> 01:24:01,216
Well, I hope you're satisfied.

1029
01:24:01,661 --> 01:24:04,494
Papa! Papa!

1030
01:24:04,664 --> 01:24:05,961
Christine said...

1031
01:24:06,132 --> 01:24:10,263
Papa, did Mama sell
her brooch to give me this?

1032
01:24:10,437 --> 01:24:15,204
Well, Christine shouldn't have
told you that.

1033
01:24:15,442 --> 01:24:17,069
It's true, then.

1034
01:24:17,244 --> 01:24:22,308
Well, she didn't sell it. She traded
it to Mr. Schiller for your present.

1035
01:24:22,484 --> 01:24:24,281
Oh, but she shouldn't...

1036
01:24:24,452 --> 01:24:27,216
- I never meant...
- But, look, Katrin...

1037
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:32,193
...you wanted your present,
and Mama wanted your happiness.

1038
01:24:32,361 --> 01:24:35,262
Well, she wanted that more
than she wanted that brooch.

1039
01:24:35,431 --> 01:24:38,696
But I never meant her to do that.

1040
01:24:38,868 --> 01:24:41,064
She loved it so.

1041
01:24:41,238 --> 01:24:43,866
It was all she had of Grandmother's.

1042
01:24:44,041 --> 01:24:48,068
But she always meant
it for you, Katrin...

1043
01:24:48,245 --> 01:24:50,907
...and you mustn't cry.
You have your play to act.

1044
01:24:51,082 --> 01:24:53,107
I don't want to act in it now.

1045
01:24:53,284 --> 01:24:56,412
- But you must. Your audience is waiting.
- I don't care.

1046
01:24:56,587 --> 01:24:58,919
But you must care.

1047
01:25:00,224 --> 01:25:02,125
Now, look, Katrin...

1048
01:25:02,294 --> 01:25:05,195
...tonight you are not Katrin any longer.

1049
01:25:05,364 --> 01:25:08,458
Tonight you are an actress,
and an actress must act...

1050
01:25:08,634 --> 01:25:12,070
...whatever she is feeling.
There's an old saying that says:

1051
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:15,696
- The...
- The mails must go through!

1052
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:17,274
The mail...

1053
01:25:31,959 --> 01:25:35,191
The show must go on.

1054
01:25:35,364 --> 01:25:38,390
Now, you stop crying and go back
and act your play.

1055
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:42,333
We'll talk of this later. Afterwards.

1056
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,771
All right.

1057
01:25:47,944 --> 01:25:50,310
I'll go.

1058
01:26:31,591 --> 01:26:33,718
I'm worried about her, Lars.

1059
01:26:33,894 --> 01:26:37,557
She was not good in the play tonight.

1060
01:26:37,731 --> 01:26:40,599
I've heard her practice it here.

1061
01:26:40,768 --> 01:26:42,861
She was good.

1062
01:26:43,037 --> 01:26:45,938
But tonight...

1063
01:26:46,107 --> 01:26:49,133
I don't know. She was not good.

1064
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:51,506
Look, Martha, tonight after you leave...

1065
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,376
...Katrin found out about your brooch.
- My brooch?

1066
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:59,180
- Yeah.
- How? Who told her?

1067
01:27:00,055 --> 01:27:01,990
Christine.

1068
01:27:02,725 --> 01:27:05,751
- Why?
- I don't know.

1069
01:27:06,896 --> 01:27:08,761
Christine!

1070
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,627
Christine!

1071
01:27:11,634 --> 01:27:13,500
Yes, Mama?

1072
01:27:13,671 --> 01:27:16,731
Did you tell Katrin tonight
about my brooch?

1073
01:27:16,907 --> 01:27:18,465
Yes.

1074
01:27:18,642 --> 01:27:20,542
Why did you?

1075
01:27:20,711 --> 01:27:24,204
Because I hated the smug way she was
acting about that dresser set.

1076
01:27:24,382 --> 01:27:28,910
Is no excuse. You make her unhappy.
You make her not good in the play.

1077
01:27:29,087 --> 01:27:31,749
Well, she made you unhappy,
giving up your brooch...

1078
01:27:31,923 --> 01:27:34,722
Is not your business.
I choose to give my brooch.

1079
01:27:34,894 --> 01:27:39,888
Is not you to judge. You know
I do not want you to tell.

1080
01:27:40,933 --> 01:27:43,766
I'm angry with you, Christine.

1081
01:27:46,039 --> 01:27:47,836
I'm sorry.

1082
01:27:53,714 --> 01:27:56,650
But I'm not sorry I told.

1083
01:28:00,522 --> 01:28:03,116
Christine is the stubborn one.

1084
01:28:13,068 --> 01:28:15,764
Come on, Katrin, it's all right.

1085
01:28:22,412 --> 01:28:24,471
What happened at the meeting tonight?

1086
01:28:24,648 --> 01:28:26,946
Oh, we go back to work
tomorrow morning.

1087
01:28:27,117 --> 01:28:29,109
That's bully, isn't it, Mama?

1088
01:28:29,287 --> 01:28:31,050
Yeah, is good.

1089
01:28:44,503 --> 01:28:46,903
Here's your brooch, Mama.

1090
01:28:48,273 --> 01:28:51,675
I'm sorry I was so bad in the play.

1091
01:28:51,844 --> 01:28:56,042
I'll go help Christine with the dishes.

1092
01:29:07,394 --> 01:29:09,521
Mr. Schiller give it back to her?

1093
01:29:09,697 --> 01:29:11,325
We went to his house to get it.

1094
01:29:11,499 --> 01:29:14,957
He didn't want to, but Katrin
begged and begged him.

1095
01:29:15,136 --> 01:29:18,401
And the dresser set,
she give that back?

1096
01:29:18,573 --> 01:29:20,541
It was awful hard
for her to do, Mama.

1097
01:29:20,709 --> 01:29:22,871
She's a good kid.

1098
01:29:23,546 --> 01:29:25,605
Good night. I gotta get up early.

1099
01:29:25,781 --> 01:29:27,942
- Good night, Nels.
- Good night, Papa.

1100
01:29:28,117 --> 01:29:30,950
- Good night, Nels.
- Good night, Mama.

1101
01:29:35,392 --> 01:29:37,724
Nels is the kind one.

1102
01:29:41,064 --> 01:29:42,895
Katrin.

1103
01:29:43,968 --> 01:29:45,629
Katrin.

1104
01:29:52,744 --> 01:29:54,838
Katrin, come here.

1105
01:30:03,555 --> 01:30:05,717
You put this on.

1106
01:30:07,127 --> 01:30:09,823
No, it's yours.

1107
01:30:10,597 --> 01:30:13,828
It is your graduation present.

1108
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:18,566
I put it on for you.

1109
01:30:22,843 --> 01:30:24,572
I'll wear it always.

1110
01:30:24,745 --> 01:30:27,681
I'll keep it forever.

1111
01:30:27,849 --> 01:30:31,182
Christine should not have told you.

1112
01:30:31,353 --> 01:30:33,014
I'm glad she did now.

1113
01:30:33,789 --> 01:30:35,814
I'm glad too.

1114
01:30:52,943 --> 01:30:55,343
Good night, Christine.

1115
01:30:56,246 --> 01:30:58,874
Good night, Mama.

1116
01:31:04,756 --> 01:31:07,020
Good night, Papa.

1117
01:31:08,293 --> 01:31:10,489
Good night, baby.

1118
01:31:14,433 --> 01:31:16,901
Good night, Katrin.

1119
01:31:17,069 --> 01:31:19,537
Good night, Christine.

1120
01:31:20,674 --> 01:31:22,642
Katrin.

1121
01:31:24,578 --> 01:31:28,207
I'm sorry, Papa.
I just don't feel like it.

1122
01:32:34,887 --> 01:32:36,651
Katrin.

1123
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:41,293
For me?

1124
01:32:41,461 --> 01:32:44,396
For our grown-up daughter.

1125
01:33:07,723 --> 01:33:11,182
- Katrin is the dramatic one.
- Yeah.

1126
01:33:11,361 --> 01:33:15,525
Is too bad. Her first cup of coffee,
and she doesn't drink it.

1127
01:33:15,699 --> 01:33:19,864
It would not have been good
for her so late at night.

1128
01:33:20,705 --> 01:33:22,400
Lars, you drink it.

1129
01:33:22,573 --> 01:33:25,701
We do not wanna waste it.

1130
01:33:26,177 --> 01:33:29,943
And you, Martha, are the practical one.

1131
01:33:35,187 --> 01:33:37,246
There is a time for everything.

1132
01:33:37,422 --> 01:33:40,687
A time for being born
and a time for coming of age...

1133
01:33:40,859 --> 01:33:42,851
...and there is a time for death too.

1134
01:33:43,029 --> 01:33:45,361
I remember when the telegram arrived.

1135
01:33:45,531 --> 01:33:48,364
- Jenny! Uncle Chris is dying!
- I don't believe it.

1136
01:33:48,534 --> 01:33:51,970
- He's too mean to die, ever!
- I cannot stop to argue.

1137
01:33:52,138 --> 01:33:54,107
There's a train at 1 1:00.

1138
01:33:54,275 --> 01:33:56,573
It take four hours.

1139
01:33:56,744 --> 01:33:59,872
You call Sigrid and Trina!

1140
01:34:05,687 --> 01:34:08,656
When Mama told me I was to go with her,
I was thrilled...

1141
01:34:08,823 --> 01:34:10,085
...and I was frightened.

1142
01:34:10,258 --> 01:34:12,783
It was exciting taking
sandwiches on the train...

1143
01:34:12,961 --> 01:34:15,123
...as though we were going on a picnic.

1144
01:34:15,298 --> 01:34:18,131
But I was scared at the idea
of seeing death.

1145
01:34:18,301 --> 01:34:21,236
Although I told myself
that if I were going to write...

1146
01:34:21,404 --> 01:34:24,271
...I'd have to experience everything.

1147
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:30,311
But, even so, I hoped it would
all be over when we got there.

1148
01:34:34,918 --> 01:34:37,615
It was afternoon when we arrived.

1149
01:34:37,789 --> 01:34:41,054
The ranch was about
three miles from the town...

1150
01:34:41,225 --> 01:34:44,160
...a rambling, derelict old place.

1151
01:34:44,329 --> 01:34:49,962
There were wide fields and tall trees
and the smell of honeysuckle.

1152
01:34:50,135 --> 01:34:54,003
The woman came out
on the steps to meet us.

1153
01:35:09,256 --> 01:35:11,121
How is he? Is he...?

1154
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:13,226
Come in, won't you?

1155
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,246
I want more.

1156
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:36,716
Give me more.

1157
01:35:36,886 --> 01:35:39,286
There's still some in the bottle.

1158
01:35:39,455 --> 01:35:42,789
Uncle Chris, that will not help now.

1159
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,657
It always help. Now especially.

1160
01:35:46,830 --> 01:35:49,321
Uncle Chris, I don't think you realize...

1161
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:52,527
What don't I realize?

1162
01:35:53,671 --> 01:35:55,935
That I'm dying?

1163
01:35:56,107 --> 01:35:59,235
Why else do I think you come here?

1164
01:35:59,411 --> 01:36:02,677
Why else do I think you
stand there watching me?

1165
01:36:02,848 --> 01:36:04,611
Get out.

1166
01:36:04,784 --> 01:36:06,445
Get out. I don't want you here.

1167
01:36:06,619 --> 01:36:10,953
Oh, very well. Very well. We be outside
on the porch if you want us.

1168
01:36:11,123 --> 01:36:14,321
That is where I want you, on the porch.

1169
01:36:17,764 --> 01:36:21,860
Oh, wait. That is Arne. Come here, Arne.

1170
01:36:27,308 --> 01:36:28,639
How is your knee?

1171
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:30,903
It... It's fine, Uncle Chris.

1172
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:32,740
Does not hurt anymore?

1173
01:36:32,914 --> 01:36:34,644
No.

1174
01:36:34,817 --> 01:36:37,547
You don't say "dum geit" anymore?

1175
01:36:37,719 --> 01:36:40,279
No, Uncle Chris.

1176
01:36:40,889 --> 01:36:42,220
You walk good?

1177
01:36:42,391 --> 01:36:44,621
- Quite good?
- Yes.

1178
01:36:46,096 --> 01:36:48,121
Is good.

1179
01:36:48,298 --> 01:36:53,759
- Uncle Chris, Arne has always been...
- I tell you all to get out!

1180
01:36:53,937 --> 01:36:56,236
Except Martha.

1181
01:36:58,943 --> 01:37:00,774
Katrin.

1182
01:37:02,046 --> 01:37:07,006
Katrin can stay. She and I have secret.

1183
01:37:07,586 --> 01:37:09,986
Do you remember?

1184
01:37:10,155 --> 01:37:12,350
Yes, Uncle Chris.

1185
01:37:18,498 --> 01:37:20,466
Uncle Chris, what are you doing?

1186
01:37:20,633 --> 01:37:22,328
You must lie down again.

1187
01:37:22,602 --> 01:37:25,093
- Why didn't you give me drink?
- No, Uncle Chris.

1188
01:37:25,471 --> 01:37:28,304
We cannot waste what is left
in the bottle!

1189
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:30,404
You do not drink it.

1190
01:37:30,577 --> 01:37:32,738
Who will drink it when I'm gone?

1191
01:37:32,913 --> 01:37:37,077
What harm can it do now? I die anyway.

1192
01:37:37,851 --> 01:37:40,116
You give it me.

1193
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:45,690
All right. I give you drink.
You lie down again.

1194
01:39:07,917 --> 01:39:10,442
- Martha.
- Yeah.

1195
01:39:11,454 --> 01:39:16,790
You sell this ranch and give
the money to Jessie.

1196
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,587
Jessie?

1197
01:39:18,762 --> 01:39:22,892
Jessie Brown, my housekeeper.

1198
01:39:23,066 --> 01:39:26,194
No. Why do I call her that to you?

1199
01:39:27,604 --> 01:39:29,869
She is my wife.

1200
01:39:30,041 --> 01:39:34,171
For several years, she has been my wife.

1201
01:39:34,345 --> 01:39:38,111
She used to have husband
in asylum in Stockton...

1202
01:39:38,283 --> 01:39:40,684
...but when he die, we get married.

1203
01:39:40,853 --> 01:39:43,617
Only I do not tell the aunts.

1204
01:39:43,789 --> 01:39:46,257
They snub her before.

1205
01:39:46,425 --> 01:39:48,552
So...

1206
01:39:48,727 --> 01:39:52,164
- I play fine joke on them.
- Yeah.

1207
01:39:55,602 --> 01:39:59,038
But there is no money for you, Martha.

1208
01:39:59,205 --> 01:40:03,609
Always I wanted there should be
money to make Nels doctor.

1209
01:40:03,778 --> 01:40:09,080
But there were other things.
Quick things.

1210
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:11,879
And now there is no time to make more.

1211
01:40:12,054 --> 01:40:14,989
There is no money.

1212
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:20,592
But you make Nels doctor all the same.

1213
01:40:20,762 --> 01:40:24,255
- You like?
- Yeah, sure, Uncle Chris.

1214
01:40:24,434 --> 01:40:28,200
Is what Lars and I have always
wanted for him.

1215
01:40:28,371 --> 01:40:31,636
To help people who suffer.

1216
01:40:32,141 --> 01:40:36,272
Is greatest thing in world.

1217
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:40,508
It is to have little of God in you.

1218
01:40:46,591 --> 01:40:48,889
Where is Jessie?

1219
01:40:50,061 --> 01:40:53,360
I think she wait outside, Uncle Chris.

1220
01:40:53,531 --> 01:40:55,796
You call her.

1221
01:40:55,968 --> 01:40:58,994
I like you both be here.

1222
01:41:17,892 --> 01:41:20,554
Oh, Katrin.

1223
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:35,276
Your mama write me
you drink coffee now?

1224
01:41:38,515 --> 01:41:43,179
Katrin, who will be writer.

1225
01:41:46,022 --> 01:41:49,049
You're not frightened of me now.

1226
01:41:50,861 --> 01:41:52,829
No, Uncle Chris.

1227
01:41:59,203 --> 01:42:04,870
One day maybe you write story
from Uncle Chris.

1228
01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:10,348
If you remember.

1229
01:42:11,317 --> 01:42:13,182
I'll remember.

1230
01:42:23,564 --> 01:42:28,365
I think best maybe
Katrin go away now.

1231
01:42:30,037 --> 01:42:32,199
Farvel, Katrin.

1232
01:42:32,373 --> 01:42:34,864
Goodbye, Uncle Chris.

1233
01:42:36,711 --> 01:42:42,172
You say it in Norwegian, like I do?

1234
01:42:46,956 --> 01:42:49,186
Farvel, Uncle Chris.

1235
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:18,812
Maybe I should introduce
you to each other.

1236
01:43:20,559 --> 01:43:22,652
Jessie...

1237
01:43:23,595 --> 01:43:26,895
...this is my niece, Martha.

1238
01:43:27,066 --> 01:43:30,263
The only one of my nieces I can stand.

1239
01:43:30,436 --> 01:43:32,370
Martha...

1240
01:43:33,706 --> 01:43:37,074
...this is my wife, Jessie...

1241
01:43:38,812 --> 01:43:43,010
...who has given me much happiness.

1242
01:43:43,784 --> 01:43:46,810
I'm very glad to meet you.

1243
01:43:46,987 --> 01:43:50,515
- I am too, Martha.
- Is good.

1244
01:43:51,226 --> 01:43:52,750
And now...

1245
01:43:52,928 --> 01:43:56,455
...you give me one more drink.

1246
01:43:57,933 --> 01:44:00,562
You have drink with me, both of you.

1247
01:44:00,736 --> 01:44:03,603
That way, we finish the bottle.

1248
01:44:03,773 --> 01:44:05,900
Yes?

1249
01:44:07,109 --> 01:44:09,408
Yeah, sure, Uncle Chris.

1250
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:13,175
Jessie, you get best glasses.

1251
01:44:18,021 --> 01:44:20,354
What is the time?

1252
01:44:20,525 --> 01:44:24,427
Is about half past 4, Uncle Chris.

1253
01:44:27,131 --> 01:44:32,468
The sun come around this side
the house in afternoon.

1254
01:44:35,541 --> 01:44:37,372
I pull the shade.

1255
01:44:37,543 --> 01:44:39,977
No! No, Martha!

1256
01:44:41,313 --> 01:44:44,249
I don't like it dark.

1257
01:44:45,952 --> 01:44:48,750
The sun is good.

1258
01:44:56,397 --> 01:44:59,992
No, no, no. I take now without water.

1259
01:45:00,167 --> 01:45:04,366
Last drink always without water.

1260
01:45:04,539 --> 01:45:07,736
Is Norwegian custom. True?

1261
01:45:07,909 --> 01:45:09,342
True.

1262
01:45:10,212 --> 01:45:13,375
No, no. I do not need you feed it to me.

1263
01:45:13,548 --> 01:45:16,712
I can drink myself.

1264
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:22,824
You give Martha her glass?

1265
01:45:29,166 --> 01:45:30,656
So.

1266
01:46:51,222 --> 01:46:53,384
Farvel, Uncle Chris.

1267
01:47:34,335 --> 01:47:36,361
Oh, these gnats.

1268
01:47:36,539 --> 01:47:39,702
They're always worse around sunset.

1269
01:47:43,412 --> 01:47:45,904
Oh, sweetheart, stop honking that horn.

1270
01:47:46,082 --> 01:47:49,483
My goodness, you'll wear the thing out.

1271
01:47:50,654 --> 01:47:55,250
All this expense to watch
a wicked old man die of the DTs.

1272
01:47:55,425 --> 01:47:58,987
Well, you can't hurry these things.

1273
01:47:59,530 --> 01:48:02,158
I mean that...

1274
01:48:02,333 --> 01:48:05,928
Well, Mr. Thorkelson say that...

1275
01:48:19,686 --> 01:48:22,746
Uncle Chris is gone.

1276
01:48:27,427 --> 01:48:31,194
Did he...? Did he say anything
about a will?

1277
01:48:31,365 --> 01:48:33,356
There's no will.

1278
01:48:33,567 --> 01:48:36,195
Well, then, that means...

1279
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:38,998
We're his nearest relatives.

1280
01:48:39,273 --> 01:48:42,801
- There is no money either.
- How do you know?

1281
01:48:42,978 --> 01:48:44,809
He told me.

1282
01:48:46,281 --> 01:48:48,442
What's that?

1283
01:48:49,618 --> 01:48:52,986
Is an account of how he
spent the money.

1284
01:48:53,155 --> 01:48:55,282
Bills from a saloon.

1285
01:48:55,458 --> 01:48:56,948
No, Jenny.

1286
01:48:57,126 --> 01:48:58,525
No.

1287
01:48:59,395 --> 01:49:01,454
I read it to you.

1288
01:49:03,967 --> 01:49:08,802
You know how Uncle Chris was lame,
how he walked always with limp.

1289
01:49:08,972 --> 01:49:12,704
It was his one thought. Lame people.

1290
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:17,946
He would have liked
to be doctor and help them.

1291
01:49:18,116 --> 01:49:19,811
Instead, he...

1292
01:49:19,984 --> 01:49:22,316
He help in other ways.

1293
01:49:22,854 --> 01:49:25,415
I read you the last page.

1294
01:49:26,125 --> 01:49:29,959
"Joseph Spinelli, 4 year old...

1295
01:49:30,129 --> 01:49:36,433
...tubercular left leg, $337.1 8.

1296
01:49:37,938 --> 01:49:40,099
Walks now.

1297
01:49:41,474 --> 01:49:44,842
Esther Jensen, 9 year.

1298
01:49:45,012 --> 01:49:51,281
Club foot, $21 7.50.

1299
01:49:52,019 --> 01:49:53,987
Walks now.

1300
01:49:57,059 --> 01:50:00,119
- Arne Solfeldt."
- My Arne?

1301
01:50:00,295 --> 01:50:02,195
"Nine year.

1302
01:50:02,364 --> 01:50:04,855
Fractured kneecap...

1303
01:50:05,033 --> 01:50:09,903
...$442.1 6."

1304
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:14,209
Mother.

1305
01:50:16,279 --> 01:50:18,305
When do we eat?

1306
01:50:21,819 --> 01:50:23,548
What is it?

1307
01:50:23,721 --> 01:50:26,918
Is Uncle Chris...?

1308
01:50:34,699 --> 01:50:39,797
I like to write "walks now." Yeah?

1309
01:50:40,906 --> 01:50:42,168
Yeah.

1310
01:50:42,341 --> 01:50:46,209
Or maybe even "runs"?

1311
01:50:53,787 --> 01:50:56,051
So...

1312
01:50:56,223 --> 01:50:58,691
...is finish.

1313
01:51:00,427 --> 01:51:02,953
Was good.

1314
01:51:06,367 --> 01:51:08,528
Was good.

1315
01:51:17,212 --> 01:51:20,773
You can go in and see him now
if you want.

1316
01:51:22,385 --> 01:51:25,320
Maybe you never meet
Uncle Chris' wife...

1317
01:51:25,488 --> 01:51:27,888
...Mrs. Halvorsen.

1318
01:51:29,793 --> 01:51:32,421
Is true.

1319
01:51:46,178 --> 01:51:48,373
How do you do?

1320
01:51:54,252 --> 01:51:55,845
Jessie...

1321
01:51:56,022 --> 01:51:58,513
...I go in and wash the dishes.

1322
01:51:58,691 --> 01:52:00,625
How's that?

1323
01:52:13,707 --> 01:52:17,804
You like to come to San Francisco
for a little, to our house?

1324
01:52:17,979 --> 01:52:19,708
Thank you.

1325
01:52:19,881 --> 01:52:21,473
I like to have you.

1326
01:52:21,649 --> 01:52:24,675
We got room, plenty room.

1327
01:52:25,286 --> 01:52:27,949
I don't know why you should bother.

1328
01:52:28,724 --> 01:52:32,421
You were good to Uncle Chris.

1329
01:52:32,595 --> 01:52:34,654
Thank you, Martha.

1330
01:52:36,031 --> 01:52:38,500
Thank you, Martha.

1331
01:52:47,077 --> 01:52:48,943
Katrin.

1332
01:52:50,348 --> 01:52:52,316
You come and see him.

1333
01:52:52,483 --> 01:52:54,178
See him?

1334
01:52:54,352 --> 01:52:57,947
- You mean...?
- Yeah, I like you see him.

1335
01:52:58,122 --> 01:52:59,886
He looks happy.

1336
01:53:00,726 --> 01:53:03,160
I like you to know
what death looks like.

1337
01:53:03,328 --> 01:53:06,388
Then you are not frightened of it ever.

1338
01:53:15,742 --> 01:53:18,108
Will you come with me?

1339
01:53:20,547 --> 01:53:22,243
Yeah, sure. I come.

1340
01:53:28,889 --> 01:53:31,221
The woman.

1341
01:53:33,995 --> 01:53:37,556
One year later, my Aunt Trina
and Peter Thorkelson...

1342
01:53:37,732 --> 01:53:41,259
...were married in our parlor.

1343
01:53:45,608 --> 01:53:47,371
One year after that...

1344
01:53:47,543 --> 01:53:53,743
Who is the most beautiful Norwegian
baby in San Francisco?

1345
01:53:53,917 --> 01:53:56,215
Look. He's asleep.

1346
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:59,014
- Trina.
- Yeah.

1347
01:53:59,189 --> 01:54:01,851
Do you know what next Thursday is?

1348
01:54:02,025 --> 01:54:04,323
Our anniversary.

1349
01:54:05,363 --> 01:54:08,924
What would you think
of our giving a little party?

1350
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:15,130
I think it is time you took your place
in society.

1351
01:54:15,306 --> 01:54:21,507
Well, what would you say
to ice cream and cookies for the ladies?

1352
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:24,877
And coffee, of course.

1353
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:27,611
Perhaps port wine for the gentlemen.

1354
01:54:27,787 --> 01:54:30,847
- Port wine?
- Just a little.

1355
01:54:31,024 --> 01:54:35,859
You could bring it in already
poured out in little glasses.

1356
01:54:36,029 --> 01:54:39,193
And Jenny or Sigrid could
help me serve the ice cream.

1357
01:54:39,367 --> 01:54:40,834
No.

1358
01:54:41,002 --> 01:54:44,802
You will have someone in
to help you in the kitchen.

1359
01:54:46,641 --> 01:54:48,735
You mean a waitress?

1360
01:54:48,910 --> 01:54:52,311
Oh, Peter. But none of us have ever...

1361
01:54:52,481 --> 01:54:54,210
You don't really think...

1362
01:54:54,383 --> 01:54:56,317
Oh, no.

1363
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:01,149
Trina...

1364
01:55:01,324 --> 01:55:05,727
...there is something
I would like to tell you.

1365
01:55:05,895 --> 01:55:11,163
I am not very good
at expressing myself...

1366
01:55:11,335 --> 01:55:15,601
...or my deeper feelings.

1367
01:55:15,773 --> 01:55:17,638
But...

1368
01:55:17,808 --> 01:55:20,038
...I want you to know...

1369
01:55:20,210 --> 01:55:24,807
...that I am not only very fond of you...

1370
01:55:24,983 --> 01:55:29,215
...but I'm very proud of you as well.

1371
01:55:29,387 --> 01:55:34,416
And l... I want you to have the best
of everything...

1372
01:55:34,593 --> 01:55:39,758
...as far as it is in my power
to give it to you.

1373
01:55:41,901 --> 01:55:45,497
I want you to have a waitress.

1374
01:55:45,672 --> 01:55:48,300
Oh, Peter.

1375
01:55:50,477 --> 01:55:53,845
Papa was working steadily now,
and the little bank was fuller...

1376
01:55:54,015 --> 01:55:57,644
...than it had ever been, but the old
and thrifty ways continued.

1377
01:55:57,819 --> 01:55:59,719
I've just decided something.

1378
01:55:59,887 --> 01:56:01,946
What have you decided?

1379
01:56:02,123 --> 01:56:07,960
If Nels is gonna be a doctor, when I
grow up, I'm gonna be a veterinarian.

1380
01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:10,155
I remember one afternoon...

1381
01:56:10,332 --> 01:56:12,732
...when I was going out
to shop for Mama.

1382
01:56:12,901 --> 01:56:15,530
- Goodbye, everybody.
- Goodbye.

1383
01:56:15,772 --> 01:56:18,366
A horse doctor? Goodbye, Katrin.

1384
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:21,999
There are more animals in the world
than there are human beings...

1385
01:56:22,178 --> 01:56:25,478
...and more human doctors
than there are animal ones.

1386
01:56:25,649 --> 01:56:28,413
It isn't fair, Mama.

1387
01:56:30,588 --> 01:56:35,321
I don't suppose we can have a horse,
can we, Papa?

1388
01:56:36,228 --> 01:56:39,595
- Maybe a pony?
- A pony?

1389
01:56:39,765 --> 01:56:43,462
Dagmar, what are you going to do
when the pony grows up to be a horse?

1390
01:56:43,635 --> 01:56:47,402
Oh, I never thought of that yet.

1391
01:57:10,064 --> 01:57:12,828
- What is it?
- Mama...

1392
01:57:13,001 --> 01:57:14,969
...l'm not going to college.

1393
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:16,467
And why not?

1394
01:57:16,638 --> 01:57:20,302
Because it'd be a waste of money.
The point of my going to college...

1395
01:57:20,476 --> 01:57:22,171
...was to be a writer.

1396
01:57:22,344 --> 01:57:27,680
- Well, I'm not going to be one.
- Katrin. Is your letter makes you say this?

1397
01:57:28,784 --> 01:57:30,719
Has a story come back again?

1398
01:57:30,887 --> 01:57:33,219
This is the tenth time.

1399
01:57:33,390 --> 01:57:37,292
- It's the best I've ever written.
- What your teacher say about this?

1400
01:57:37,461 --> 01:57:39,725
Teachers don't know
anything about writing.

1401
01:57:39,896 --> 01:57:42,491
They just know about literature.

1402
01:57:42,667 --> 01:57:46,797
Say... Say, Katrin, last night,
I read an article in the newspapers.

1403
01:57:46,971 --> 01:57:48,802
I saved it for you.

1404
01:57:48,973 --> 01:57:51,703
You know, my eye just caught
a headline. It says...

1405
01:57:51,876 --> 01:57:53,276
Oh, here it is.

1406
01:57:53,445 --> 01:57:58,781
It says, "Woman writer tells key
to literary success."

1407
01:57:58,951 --> 01:58:01,112
- Who?
- Is a lady called...

1408
01:58:01,286 --> 01:58:03,619
- Where is everybody?
...Florence Dana Moorhead.

1409
01:58:03,790 --> 01:58:06,554
- Lars, the spread.
- All right, Mama.

1410
01:58:06,726 --> 01:58:08,887
- "Florence Dana..."
- What's going on here?

1411
01:58:09,062 --> 01:58:11,087
- Nothing.
- It gives her picture here.

1412
01:58:11,264 --> 01:58:12,959
Did you ever hear of her?

1413
01:58:13,132 --> 01:58:15,260
Yes, of course. Everyone has.

1414
01:58:15,436 --> 01:58:18,997
- She's terribly successful.
- What does she say is the secret?

1415
01:58:19,173 --> 01:58:23,507
Well, she say... Katrin,
you better read it. Here.

1416
01:58:23,677 --> 01:58:25,578
Look.

1417
01:58:27,115 --> 01:58:30,949
"Florence Dana Moorhead, celebrated
novelist and short-story writer..."

1418
01:58:31,119 --> 01:58:32,484
Blah, blah, blah.

1419
01:58:32,654 --> 01:58:35,488
"Interviewed today in her suite
at the Fairmont."

1420
01:58:35,658 --> 01:58:36,750
Blah, blah.

1421
01:58:37,026 --> 01:58:41,429
"Pronounced sincerity the one essential
quality for success as a writer."

1422
01:58:42,198 --> 01:58:44,166
A lot of help that is.

1423
01:58:44,333 --> 01:58:46,564
If you sent your stories to this lady...

1424
01:58:46,737 --> 01:58:49,171
...maybe she'd tell you
what's wrong with them.

1425
01:58:49,339 --> 01:58:52,467
- Oh, Mama, don't be silly.
- Well, why is silly?

1426
01:58:52,643 --> 01:58:56,739
In the first place, she's a very
important person, a celebrity.

1427
01:58:56,915 --> 01:58:58,542
And she'd never read them.

1428
01:58:58,716 --> 01:59:01,981
In the second place, you seem to think
that writing's like...

1429
01:59:02,153 --> 01:59:05,486
...well, like cooking or something,
that you just need a recipe.

1430
01:59:05,657 --> 01:59:09,059
It takes a lot more.
You've got to have the gift for it.

1431
01:59:09,228 --> 01:59:12,095
You have to have the gift
for cooking too.

1432
01:59:12,264 --> 01:59:14,789
But there are things you must learn...

1433
01:59:14,967 --> 01:59:17,663
...even if you have the gift.

1434
01:59:17,836 --> 01:59:20,772
Well, that's the whole point.

1435
01:59:20,941 --> 01:59:22,431
I haven't.

1436
01:59:22,609 --> 01:59:25,077
I know now.

1437
01:59:26,146 --> 01:59:28,910
So, Papa, if you're through
with the paper...

1438
01:59:29,082 --> 01:59:34,453
...l'll take the want-ad section,
see if I can find myself a job.

1439
01:59:43,131 --> 01:59:47,431
This lady in the paper,
what else does she say, Nels?

1440
01:59:47,603 --> 01:59:49,002
Well, not much.

1441
01:59:49,171 --> 01:59:52,141
The rest seems to be
about her and her home.

1442
01:59:55,044 --> 02:00:00,243
"Apart from literature, Mrs. Moorhead's
main interest in life is gastronomy."

1443
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:04,082
Gastronomy. The stars.

1444
02:00:04,788 --> 02:00:08,724
No, eating. "A brilliant cook herself,
she says that she would as soon...

1445
02:00:08,892 --> 02:00:12,886
...turn out a good souffle
as a short story.

1446
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:19,661
Or find a new recipe
as she would a first edition."

1447
02:00:20,839 --> 02:00:24,071
Mama, I'll go see if I have
any puppies yet.

1448
02:00:24,243 --> 02:00:25,505
Yeah.

1449
02:00:25,678 --> 02:00:27,873
Let's see her picture.

1450
02:00:29,281 --> 02:00:31,374
Is kind face.

1451
02:00:32,084 --> 02:00:34,781
What is "first edition"?

1452
02:00:50,004 --> 02:00:52,438
- Christine, look.
- What, Dagmar?

1453
02:00:52,607 --> 02:00:55,075
- I've got puppies!
- How many?

1454
02:00:55,243 --> 02:00:57,678
We'll see. What will I call them?

1455
02:00:57,846 --> 02:01:00,314
Are you coming?

1456
02:01:01,150 --> 02:01:04,916
Don't name them anything
till I get there.

1457
02:01:25,710 --> 02:01:27,803
Ms. Moorhead.

1458
02:01:29,981 --> 02:01:32,006
Calling Ms. Moorhead.

1459
02:01:35,287 --> 02:01:37,084
Ms. Moorhead.

1460
02:01:37,789 --> 02:01:40,281
Calling Ms. Moorhead.

1461
02:01:42,795 --> 02:01:45,889
- Call for Ms. Moorhead.
- Yes?

1462
02:01:51,805 --> 02:01:53,534
Ms. Moorhead?

1463
02:01:56,443 --> 02:01:59,435
- Ms. Florence Dana Moorhead?
- Yes?

1464
02:01:59,613 --> 02:02:01,411
Could I speak to you, please?

1465
02:02:01,583 --> 02:02:03,016
Yes. What's it about?

1466
02:02:03,184 --> 02:02:05,948
I read in the paper
what you say about writing.

1467
02:02:06,121 --> 02:02:10,217
- Oh, yes.
- My daughter Katrin wants to be writer.

1468
02:02:10,391 --> 02:02:11,984
Oh, really?

1469
02:02:12,161 --> 02:02:15,187
- I bring her stories.
- Look, I'm afraid I'm in a hurry.

1470
02:02:15,364 --> 02:02:18,731
- I'm leaving San Francisco this evening.
- But if I could talk...

1471
02:02:18,901 --> 02:02:22,599
...for just two minute. That's all.
- I've had to make it a rule...

1472
02:02:22,773 --> 02:02:26,004
...never to read anyone's
unpublished material.

1473
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:33,514
It said that you like to collect
recipes for eating.

1474
02:02:33,684 --> 02:02:36,084
Yes, I've written
several books on cooking.

1475
02:02:36,254 --> 02:02:39,451
l, too, am interested in gastronomy.

1476
02:02:39,624 --> 02:02:41,649
I am good cook. Norwegian.

1477
02:02:41,826 --> 02:02:45,126
I make good Norwegian dishes.
Lutefisk and koettbullar...

1478
02:02:45,297 --> 02:02:49,427
...that's meatballs with cream sauce.
- I know. I've eaten them in Christiania.

1479
02:02:49,601 --> 02:02:52,195
My mother give me
special recipe for koettbullar.

1480
02:02:52,371 --> 02:02:54,896
She was best cook I ever know.

1481
02:02:56,643 --> 02:02:59,737
Never have I told this recipe,
not even to my sisters...

1482
02:02:59,913 --> 02:03:02,438
...because they are not good cooks.

1483
02:03:02,615 --> 02:03:07,110
But if you let me talk to you,
I give it to you.

1484
02:03:07,288 --> 02:03:09,688
Is fine recipe.

1485
02:03:15,296 --> 02:03:17,527
Now, your daughter
wants to write, you say.

1486
02:03:17,699 --> 02:03:19,166
- Yeah.
- Does she write?

1487
02:03:19,334 --> 02:03:22,895
- Or does she only want to write?
- She writes all the time.

1488
02:03:23,071 --> 02:03:26,837
Maybe she should not be author,
but is hard to give up something...

1489
02:03:27,008 --> 02:03:28,909
...that has meant so much.
- I agree.

1490
02:03:29,078 --> 02:03:34,038
- I bring her stories. I bring 1 2.
- Twelve.

1491
02:03:34,283 --> 02:03:37,480
Well, if you could read maybe just one.

1492
02:03:37,653 --> 02:03:41,249
To know if someone cooks well,
you do not need to eat a whole dinner.

1493
02:03:41,425 --> 02:03:43,393
You're very persuasive.

1494
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:47,189
- Why didn't your daughter come herself?
- Well, she was too unhappy...

1495
02:03:47,364 --> 02:03:50,163
...and too scared of you.
You are celebrity.

1496
02:03:50,335 --> 02:03:55,204
- But I see your picture in the paper.
- That frightful picture.

1497
02:03:55,373 --> 02:03:59,275
Well, is a picture of woman
who like to eat good.

1498
02:04:00,012 --> 02:04:01,604
It certainly is.

1499
02:04:01,847 --> 02:04:03,610
Now tell me about the koettbullar.

1500
02:04:03,782 --> 02:04:05,977
Yeah.

1501
02:04:07,786 --> 02:04:11,416
When you make the meatballs,
you drop them in boiling stock.

1502
02:04:11,625 --> 02:04:15,356
Not water. That is one of the secrets.

1503
02:04:16,096 --> 02:04:19,224
And the cream sauce is another secret.

1504
02:04:19,399 --> 02:04:23,803
Is half sour cream, added at the last.

1505
02:04:24,472 --> 02:04:27,407
Oh, that sounds marvelous.

1506
02:04:27,575 --> 02:04:31,409
You have to grind the meat six times...

1507
02:04:31,579 --> 02:04:33,946
...and then you...

1508
02:04:34,116 --> 02:04:39,782
Well, I could write this out for you.
And while I write, you could read.

1509
02:04:46,129 --> 02:04:49,860
I remember that having written
a tragic farewell to my art...

1510
02:04:50,033 --> 02:04:53,264
...I was busy tearing up
all the stories I'd ever written...

1511
02:04:53,436 --> 02:04:57,601
...when I heard Mama's voice
at the foot of the attic stairs.

1512
02:04:58,542 --> 02:05:01,875
- Katrin?
- Yes, Mama.

1513
02:05:03,647 --> 02:05:05,047
You are writing?

1514
02:05:05,216 --> 02:05:07,377
No, Mama.

1515
02:05:08,253 --> 02:05:10,380
That's all over.

1516
02:05:11,923 --> 02:05:14,289
That's what I want to talk
to you about.

1517
02:05:14,459 --> 02:05:16,451
It's all right, Mama. Really, it is.

1518
02:05:16,629 --> 02:05:21,794
I've been tearing up my stories.
Only, I couldn't find half of them.

1519
02:05:21,968 --> 02:05:24,937
Well, they're here.

1520
02:05:26,205 --> 02:05:28,640
Did you take them?

1521
02:05:37,317 --> 02:05:39,684
What for?

1522
02:05:40,755 --> 02:05:43,349
Katrin, I've been to see Ms. Moorhead.

1523
02:05:43,524 --> 02:05:45,185
Who's Ms...?

1524
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:47,419
Florence Dana Moorhead?

1525
02:05:47,595 --> 02:05:49,621
You took her my stories?

1526
02:05:49,798 --> 02:05:51,766
She read five of them.

1527
02:05:51,934 --> 02:05:55,062
I was two hours with her.

1528
02:05:56,372 --> 02:06:01,367
We have glass of sherry.
We have two glass of sherry.

1529
02:06:01,544 --> 02:06:03,808
What did she say about them?

1530
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:06,915
Well, she say they are not good.

1531
02:06:07,083 --> 02:06:08,812
Well, I knew that.

1532
02:06:08,985 --> 02:06:11,284
It was hardly worth going to the trouble.

1533
02:06:11,455 --> 02:06:13,047
But she say more.

1534
02:06:13,224 --> 02:06:15,590
Will you listen, Katrin?

1535
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:18,126
Sure. I'll listen.

1536
02:06:20,197 --> 02:06:26,330
She say you write now only because
of what you have read in other books.

1537
02:06:26,505 --> 02:06:32,570
That for years, she write bad stories
about people in the olden times...

1538
02:06:32,745 --> 02:06:35,612
...until one day she remembers
something that happen...

1539
02:06:35,782 --> 02:06:39,741
...in her own town,
and she feels she must tell that.

1540
02:06:39,919 --> 02:06:43,083
And that is how she write
her first good story.

1541
02:06:43,257 --> 02:06:46,124
She say you must write
about things you know.

1542
02:06:46,293 --> 02:06:48,591
That's what my teacher always told me.

1543
02:06:48,762 --> 02:06:51,822
Yeah, well, maybe
your teacher was right.

1544
02:06:53,935 --> 02:06:56,768
But she say you are to go on writing...

1545
02:06:56,938 --> 02:06:59,839
...that you have the gift.

1546
02:07:01,276 --> 02:07:04,769
And that when you have written story
that is real and true...

1547
02:07:04,947 --> 02:07:10,510
...then you are to send it to her agent
and say she recommend you.

1548
02:07:10,686 --> 02:07:12,153
Here.

1549
02:07:12,688 --> 02:07:17,752
No. Is recipe for goulash
as her grandmother make it.

1550
02:07:18,562 --> 02:07:19,859
Here.

1551
02:07:33,144 --> 02:07:36,808
It helps, Katrin, what I have told you?

1552
02:07:36,982 --> 02:07:39,542
Yes, I guess it helps...

1553
02:07:39,718 --> 02:07:41,481
...some.

1554
02:07:41,653 --> 02:07:46,352
But I haven't been anywhere
or seen anything.

1555
02:07:46,525 --> 02:07:51,225
Well, could you write about
San Francisco, maybe?

1556
02:07:51,397 --> 02:07:54,855
Is fine city. Ms. Moorhead write
about her hometown.

1557
02:07:55,034 --> 02:07:59,404
Yes, I know, but you got to have
a central character or something.

1558
02:07:59,573 --> 02:08:02,007
She always writes about
her grandfather.

1559
02:08:02,176 --> 02:08:04,440
He was a wonderful man.

1560
02:08:04,612 --> 02:08:07,080
Well, could you maybe
write about Papa?

1561
02:08:07,248 --> 02:08:11,083
- Papa.
- Papa's a fine man. Is a wonderful man.

1562
02:08:11,253 --> 02:08:14,222
Yes, I know, but...

1563
02:08:14,389 --> 02:08:18,723
Well, I go fix supper.
Papa's working late.

1564
02:08:23,065 --> 02:08:26,000
I like you should write about Papa.

1565
02:09:19,327 --> 02:09:22,626
- Special delivery.
- Oh, dear.

1566
02:09:52,863 --> 02:09:54,922
Mama!

1567
02:09:55,099 --> 02:09:57,261
- I sold a story.
- A story?

1568
02:09:57,435 --> 02:10:01,201
Yes, here's the letter from the agent
with a check for $500.

1569
02:10:01,373 --> 02:10:03,739
Well, let me see.
Let me see what have here.

1570
02:10:03,908 --> 02:10:08,073
- Maybe I haven't read it right.
- What are you going to do with $500?

1571
02:10:08,247 --> 02:10:11,114
I don't know. I'll buy Mama
her warm coat, I know that.

1572
02:10:11,284 --> 02:10:13,218
- Coats don't cost $500.
- I know.

1573
02:10:13,386 --> 02:10:16,947
- We'll put the rest in the bank.
- Quick, before they stop the check.

1574
02:10:17,123 --> 02:10:21,288
Will you, Mama? Will you take it
to the bank downtown tomorrow?

1575
02:10:26,133 --> 02:10:28,067
What is it?

1576
02:10:29,469 --> 02:10:30,994
I do not know how.

1577
02:10:31,172 --> 02:10:35,836
Just give it to the man, tell him to put
it in your account, like you always do.

1578
02:10:36,010 --> 02:10:38,001
Mama.

1579
02:10:39,547 --> 02:10:42,415
I think you better tell them now.

1580
02:10:42,584 --> 02:10:44,609
Tell us what?

1581
02:10:45,854 --> 02:10:47,913
Is no bank account.

1582
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:50,752
Never in my life have I been
inside a bank.

1583
02:10:50,926 --> 02:10:53,555
- But you always told...
- Mama, you always said...

1584
02:10:53,730 --> 02:10:57,530
Yeah, yeah, I know, but is not true.

1585
02:10:57,767 --> 02:10:59,962
- I tell a lie.
- But why, Mama?

1586
02:11:00,136 --> 02:11:02,264
Why did you pretend?

1587
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:04,704
Is not good for little ones to be afraid...

1588
02:11:04,875 --> 02:11:06,843
...to not feel secure.

1589
02:11:07,011 --> 02:11:09,741
But now with $500, I think I can tell.

1590
02:11:09,914 --> 02:11:11,575
- Mama.
- Katrin, get the story.

1591
02:11:11,749 --> 02:11:13,581
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

1592
02:11:13,752 --> 02:11:15,413
- Dagmar.
- Yes, Mama?

1593
02:11:15,587 --> 02:11:17,214
- Come here.
- What is it?

1594
02:11:17,389 --> 02:11:21,621
Katrin write story for magazine.
They pay her $500 to print it.

1595
02:11:21,793 --> 02:11:23,420
No. You leave the rabbits.

1596
02:11:25,732 --> 02:11:28,724
Goodbye, Jo, Meg,
Amy, Beth, and Laurie.

1597
02:11:28,901 --> 02:11:31,335
Don't you do anything till I come back.

1598
02:11:31,671 --> 02:11:35,073
I want you be quiet and listen.
Katrin, read it to us.

1599
02:11:36,343 --> 02:11:38,470
You take Mr. Hyde's chair, Katrin.

1600
02:11:38,645 --> 02:11:42,137
"I shall read them at once
and place them as soon as possible.

1601
02:11:42,316 --> 02:11:44,807
Very truly yours, Bertha Stewart."

1602
02:11:46,955 --> 02:11:49,014
What is it called, the story?

1603
02:11:49,190 --> 02:11:52,887
It's called, "Mama and the Hospital."

1604
02:11:54,662 --> 02:11:57,291
- You... You write about Mama?
- Yes.

1605
02:11:57,466 --> 02:11:59,934
- Is good.
- I tell you write about Papa.

1606
02:12:00,102 --> 02:12:02,434
I tried it that way,
but it just didn't work.

1607
02:12:02,605 --> 02:12:05,073
- I tell you.
- Mama, I tried.

1608
02:12:05,241 --> 02:12:08,370
- Are you ready?
- Yes, we are ready.

1609
02:12:08,545 --> 02:12:13,141
"For as long as I could remember,
the house on the Larkin Street hill...

1610
02:12:13,316 --> 02:12:15,477
...had been home.

1611
02:12:15,652 --> 02:12:19,680
Papa and Mama had both been born
in Norway...

1612
02:12:19,857 --> 02:12:24,055
...but they came to San Francisco
because Mama's sisters were here.

1613
02:12:24,228 --> 02:12:27,197
All of us were born here.

1614
02:12:27,365 --> 02:12:31,097
Nels, the oldest and the only boy...

1615
02:12:31,270 --> 02:12:33,932
...my sister Christine...

1616
02:12:36,275 --> 02:12:38,835
...and the littlest sister, Dagmar."

1617
02:12:39,011 --> 02:12:41,537
Am I in the story?

1618
02:12:43,016 --> 02:12:47,077
"When I look back, 1 91 0 seems
like only yesterday.

1619
02:12:47,253 --> 02:12:49,517
I remember that every Saturday night...

1620
02:12:49,689 --> 02:12:51,988
...Mama used to call the family together.

1621
02:12:52,159 --> 02:12:55,356
I remember Mr. Hyde, dear Aunt Trina...

1622
02:12:55,529 --> 02:12:57,895
...and my Uncle Chris.

1623
02:12:58,065 --> 02:13:03,527
But first and foremost,
I remember Mama.

1624
02:13:05,373 --> 02:13:08,536
I remember how
on every Saturday night...

1625
02:13:08,710 --> 02:13:11,235
...Mama would sit down
at the kitchen table...

1626
02:13:11,413 --> 02:13:15,851
...and count out the money that Papa
had brought home in the little envelope.

1627
02:13:16,018 --> 02:13:18,919
There would be various stacks.

1628
02:13:19,088 --> 02:13:21,989
'For the landlord, '
Mama would say...

1629
02:13:22,158 --> 02:13:25,788
...piling up the big silver pieces.

1630
02:13:25,963 --> 02:13:30,491
'For the grocer. '
Another group of coins.

1631
02:13:30,667 --> 02:13:32,999
At last, Papa would ask:

1632
02:13:33,170 --> 02:13:34,433
'ls all? '

1633
02:13:34,606 --> 02:13:38,906
Mama would look up then and smile.
'ls good, ' she'd murmur.

1634
01:04:10,421 --> 02:14:15,438
