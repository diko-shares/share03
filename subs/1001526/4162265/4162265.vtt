00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.831
<i>Here's my day so far:</i>

2
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.664
<i>Went to jail,</i>
<i>lost the girl of my dreams,</i>

3
00:00:41.838 --> 00:00:44.136
<i>and got my butt kicked pretty good.</i>

4
00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:47.834
<i>Still, things could be a lot worse.</i>

5
00:00:49.212 --> 00:00:50.577
<i>Oh, that's right.</i>

6
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:52.978
<i>I'm falling to my death.</i>

7
00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:55.015
<i>Guess they can't.</i>

8
00:00:55.752 --> 00:00:57.447
<i>How'd it all come to this, you ask?</i>

9
00:00:58.822 --> 00:01:00.517
<i>My end starts at the beginning.</i>

10
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.690
<i>The very beginning.</i>

11
00:01:06.363 --> 00:01:08.228
<i>Yes, that's me.</i>

12
00:01:08.998 --> 00:01:11.694
<i>I had a fairly standard childhood.</i>

13
00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:15.703
<i>I came from, what you might call,</i>
<i>a broken home.</i>

14
00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:18.631
<i>Literally broken.</i>

15
00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:22.178
<i>I was eight days old</i>
<i>and still living with my parents.</i>

16
00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:24.538
<i>How sad is that?</i>

17
00:01:25.148 --> 00:01:26.809
<i>Clearly it was time to move on.</i>

18
00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:29.747
Here is your minion.
He will take care of you.

19
00:01:29.953 --> 00:01:31.352
And here is your binky.

20
00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:34.289
You are destined for...

21
00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:38.688
<i>I didn't quite hear that last part,</i>
<i>but it sounded important.</i>

22
00:01:38.862 --> 00:01:41.490
<i>- ...two, one.</i>
<i>- Destined for what?</i>

23
00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.995
<i>I set out to find my destiny.</i>

24
00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:51.869
<i>Turns out a kid from the Glaupunkt</i>
<i>quadrant had the exact same idea.</i>

25
00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.277
<i>That was the day</i>
<i>I met Mr. Goody Two-Shoes...</i>

26
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:09.656
<i>...and our glorious rivalry was born.</i>

27
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.596
<i>Could this be</i>
<i>what I was destined for?.</i>

28
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:19.230
<i>A dream life filled with luxury.</i>

29
00:02:21.237 --> 00:02:22.534
<i>Apparently not.</i>

30
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:25.975
<i>Even fate picks its favorites.</i>

31
00:02:27.343 --> 00:02:28.605
<i>No big deal.</i>

32
00:02:29.412 --> 00:02:31.437
<i>A much different fate awaited me.</i>

33
00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:42.857
A baby! How thoughtful.

34
00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:45.790
Oh, yes.
Yes, I saw it and thought of you.

35
00:02:46.796 --> 00:02:49.731
<i>Luckily I found</i>
<i>a lovely little place to call home.</i>

36
00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:51.059
Can we keep it?

37
00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:54.796
<i>A place that taught me</i>
<i>the differences between right...</i>

38
00:02:56.105 --> 00:02:57.299
<i>...and wrong.</i>

39
00:02:57.774 --> 00:02:59.799
<i>Mr. Goody Two-Shoes,</i>
<i>on the other hand,</i>

40
00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:02.467
<i>had life handed to him</i>
<i>on a silver platter.</i>

41
00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:04.112
Our baby can fly.

42
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.510
Yes, yes, nothing
but the best for you, darling.

43
00:03:06.716 --> 00:03:10.948
<i>The power of flight,</i>
<i>invulnerability, and great hair.</i>

44
00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.287
<i>But I had something far, far greater.</i>

45
00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:17.759
<i>My amazing intellect...</i>

46
00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:20.452
<i>...and knack</i>
<i>for building objects of mayhem.</i>

47
00:03:27.036 --> 00:03:30.233
<i>After a few years, and with some</i>
<i>time off for good behavior,</i>

48
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.269
<i>I was given an opportunity</i>
<i>to better myself through learning...</i>

49
00:03:35.044 --> 00:03:37.672
<i>...at a strange place called shool.</i>

50
00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:42.440
<i>It was there that I once again ran</i>
<i>into Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.</i>

51
00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:46.448
<i>He had already amassed a gigantic army</i>
<i>of soft-headed groupies.</i>

52
00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:54.920
<i>He bought their affections</i>
<i>with showmanship</i>

53
00:03:55.064 --> 00:03:57.430
<i>and extravagant gifts of deliciousness.</i>

54
00:03:59.903 --> 00:04:04.431
<i>So I, too, will make this popp-ed corn</i>
<i>and win over those mindless drones.</i>

55
00:04:04.574 --> 00:04:05.973
Lights out.

56
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.058
<i>That's when I learned</i>
<i>a very hard lesson:</i>

57
00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.891
<i>Good receives all the praise</i>
<i>and adulation,</i>

58
00:04:29.065 --> 00:04:31.932
<i>while evil is</i>
<i>sent to quiet-time in the corner.</i>

59
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.366
<i>So fitting in wasn't</i>
<i>really an option.</i>

60
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.808
<i>While they were learning</i>
<i>the</i> Itsy Bitsy Spider...

61
00:04:40.777 --> 00:04:44.975
<i>...I learned how to dehydrate animate</i>
<i>objects and rehydrate them at will.</i>

62
00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.948
<i>Some days, it felt like it was</i>
<i>just me and Minion against the world.</i>

63
00:04:52.422 --> 00:04:54.083
<i>No matter how hard I tried,</i>

64
00:04:54.257 --> 00:04:56.316
<i>I was always the odd man out,</i>

65
00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:58.255
<i>the last one picked,</i>

66
00:04:58.428 --> 00:05:00.521
<i>the screw-up, the black sheep...</i>

67
00:05:00.763 --> 00:05:02.060
Get him!

68
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:03.493
<i>- ...the bad boy.</i>
- Freak!

69
00:05:08.438 --> 00:05:09.598
Weirdo!

70
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:17.142
<i>Was this my destiny?</i>

71
00:05:17.847 --> 00:05:20.042
<i>Wait, maybe it was.</i>

72
00:05:21.084 --> 00:05:24.019
<i>Being bad is</i>
<i>the one thing I'm good at.</i>

73
00:05:24.887 --> 00:05:28.288
<i>Then it hit me:</i>
<i>If I was the bad boy,</i>

74
00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:32.451
<i>then I was going to be</i>
<i>the baddest boy of them all.</i>

75
00:05:34.297 --> 00:05:36.788
<i>I was destined to be</i>
<i>a super-villain,</i>

76
00:05:36.966 --> 00:05:39.594
<i>and we were destined to be rivals.</i>

77
00:05:40.837 --> 00:05:42.702
<i>The die had been cast,</i>

78
00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:47.071
<i>and so began an enduring, epic,</i>
<i>lifelong career.</i>

79
00:05:47.243 --> 00:05:49.268
<i>And I loved it.</i>

80
00:05:51.247 --> 00:05:53.579
<i>Our battles quickly got more elaborate.</i>

81
00:05:54.317 --> 00:05:55.750
<i>He would win some.</i>

82
00:05:56.552 --> 00:05:58.383
<i>I would almost win others.</i>

83
00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:03.858
<i>He took the name Metro Man,</i>
<i>defender of Metrocity.</i>

84
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.652
<i>I decided to pick something</i>
<i>a little more humble: Megamind...</i>

85
00:06:08.197 --> 00:06:12.600
<i>...incredibly handsome criminal genius</i>
<i>and master of all villainy.</i>

86
00:06:24.113 --> 00:06:26.206
Read on your own time. Open up.

87
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:34.656
- Hey!
- Boo!

88
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:39.992
Oh, good morning, Warden.

89
00:06:40.163 --> 00:06:43.098
Great news: I'm a changed man, and...

90
00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:46.997
...and I'm ready to re-enter society
as a solid citizen.

91
00:06:47.336 --> 00:06:49.566
You're a villain,
and you'll always be a villain.

92
00:06:49.772 --> 00:06:52.400
You'll never change,
and you'll never leave.

93
00:06:52.575 --> 00:06:53.872
You're fun.

94
00:06:54.043 --> 00:06:55.305
You got a present in the mail.

95
00:06:55.478 --> 00:06:56.843
Is it a puppy?

96
00:06:57.013 --> 00:07:02.178
From Metro Man. "To count every
second of your 85 life sentences."

97
00:07:02.351 --> 00:07:05.616
That's funny. Never thought Metro Man
was the gloating type.

98
00:07:05.755 --> 00:07:08.485
Oh, but he does have nice taste.
I think I'll keep it.

99
00:07:08.658 --> 00:07:10.785
Any chance you could give me the time?

100
00:07:10.927 --> 00:07:13.896
I don't want to be late for the opening
of the Metro Man Museum.

101
00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:17.595
Oh no. Looks like
you're gonna miss it,

102
00:07:17.767 --> 00:07:19.667
by several thousand years.

103
00:07:21.104 --> 00:07:22.196
Oh, am I?

104
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.243
<i>Happy Metro Man Day, Metro City.</i>

105
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:35.274
<i>It's a beautiful day</i>
<i>in beautiful downtown,</i>

106
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:39.547
<i>where we're here to honor</i>
<i>a beautiful man, Metro Man.</i>

107
00:07:40.123 --> 00:07:44.287
His heart is an ocean
that's inside a bigger ocean.

108
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:47.759
For years he's been watching us
with his super-vision,

109
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.458
saving us with his super-strength
and caring for us with his super-heart.

110
00:07:52.835 --> 00:07:55.429
Now it's our turn
to give something back.

111
00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:57.539
This is Roxanne Ritchi,
reporting live

112
00:07:57.707 --> 00:08:00.141
from the dedication
of the Metro Man Museum.

113
00:08:00.943 --> 00:08:02.934
Wow. OK, the stuff
they make you read on-air,

114
00:08:03.112 --> 00:08:05.376
that's un-freaking-believable.
It's crazy.

115
00:08:05.548 --> 00:08:07.778
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.

116
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.349
What I was trying to say was,

117
00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:12.215
I can't believe
that in our modern society,

118
00:08:12.388 --> 00:08:14.879
they let, like,
actual art get onto the news.

119
00:08:15.057 --> 00:08:16.354
- Nice save, Hal.
- What are we...

120
00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:18.619
Like, let's just get
a coffee or something.

121
00:08:18.795 --> 00:08:21.457
Come on, it's time to get
in the Metro Man Day spirit.

122
00:08:21.631 --> 00:08:23.030
Well, if I were Metro Man,

123
00:08:23.166 --> 00:08:25.031
Megamind wouldn't be
kidnapping you all the time.

124
00:08:25.168 --> 00:08:27.534
- That's the first thing.
- That's sweet, Hal.

125
00:08:27.703 --> 00:08:31.002
And I'd be watching you,
like a dingo watches a human baby.

126
00:08:31.207 --> 00:08:32.435
OK, that sounded...

127
00:08:32.608 --> 00:08:34.872
- OK, that sounded a little weird.
- A little bit. Yeah.

128
00:08:35.011 --> 00:08:37.241
And you're making a weird face,
and that's making me feel weird.

129
00:08:37.413 --> 00:08:38.812
The point is, I would watch you
like someone...

130
00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:43.282
Not love. We're not in love.
I'm not saying I love you.

131
00:08:43.452 --> 00:08:44.680
Hey, I love you. Whatever.

132
00:08:44.854 --> 00:08:46.788
But I'm not saying like
I'm in love with you. I'm saying...

133
00:08:47.557 --> 00:08:49.923
Roxanne? Roxaroo?

134
00:09:03.706 --> 00:09:05.003
- Whoa... What?
- Hey...

135
00:09:05.174 --> 00:09:08.166
Get back to work.
The city doesn't pay you to loaf.

136
00:09:08.578 --> 00:09:10.341
- Freeze!
- Whoa. What are you doing, guys?

137
00:09:10.513 --> 00:09:12.310
It's me! It's the warden.

138
00:09:13.049 --> 00:09:14.482
Hey! Open up!

139
00:09:21.824 --> 00:09:24.190
No, you fools. He's tricked us.

140
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.786
You were right.

141
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.188
I'll always be a villain.

142
00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:49.648
Well, hello good-looking.
Need a lift?

143
00:09:49.986 --> 00:09:52.181
Certainly do,
you fantastic fish, you.

144
00:09:52.355 --> 00:09:55.847
- Get in the car, you.
- I'm free!

145
00:09:56.025 --> 00:09:57.458
Right?

146
00:09:57.593 --> 00:09:59.584
Nice work sending me
the watch, Minion.

147
00:09:59.762 --> 00:10:02.128
- You got it, boss.
- Punch it!

148
00:10:03.833 --> 00:10:05.767
All right,
put your hands in the air.

149
00:10:10.907 --> 00:10:14.308
Ladies and gentlemen,
your Metro Man!

150
00:10:14.977 --> 00:10:17.673
- Who's your man?
- Metro Man!

151
00:10:18.214 --> 00:10:20.409
Yeah, Metro City!

152
00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:24.682
Gimme some. Come on. Give it now.

153
00:10:24.854 --> 00:10:27.721
Give it to me. Right on.
Gimme the good stuff. All right.

154
00:10:46.108 --> 00:10:47.302
Hey, Metro City.

155
00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:49.700
Hey. Hey.

156
00:10:52.048 --> 00:10:54.141
You know, you know,
I just want to bring it down a bit.

157
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.409
Boys, a little lower.
Thank you, fellas.

158
00:10:56.585 --> 00:10:58.815
Let's get real for a moment.

159
00:10:59.021 --> 00:11:02.252
That's right. That's right.
That's right.

160
00:11:02.425 --> 00:11:05.952
Although getting a whole museum
is super-cool, is super-cool,

161
00:11:06.128 --> 00:11:09.359
you want to know what the greatest
honor you've given me is?

162
00:11:09.498 --> 00:11:12.262
Do you really want to know? Really?

163
00:11:13.602 --> 00:11:14.899
I'll tell you.

164
00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:19.474
The greatest honor you've
given me is letting me serve you,

165
00:11:19.642 --> 00:11:21.200
the helpless people of Metro City.

166
00:11:21.344 --> 00:11:23.107
And at the end of every day,

167
00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:26.339
well, I often ask myself...

168
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.910
...who would I be without you?

169
00:11:30.086 --> 00:11:33.021
- I love you, Metro Man!
- And I love you, random citizen.

170
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.130
I tell you, Minion.
There's no place like evil lair.

171
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:48.395
I've kept it cold and damp
just for you, sir.

172
00:11:49.905 --> 00:11:52.169
How do I look, Minion?
Do I look bad?

173
00:11:52.341 --> 00:11:54.206
Disgustingly horrifying, sir.

174
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.900
You always know what to say.

175
00:11:56.078 --> 00:11:58.205
Oh, the brain-bots
certainly missed you, sir.

176
00:11:58.381 --> 00:12:00.849
Did you miss your daddy?
Who's a menacing little cyborg?

177
00:12:01.017 --> 00:12:03.247
You are. Yes, you are. No biting.

178
00:12:03.386 --> 00:12:05.377
No, no, no, no, no, no.

179
00:12:05.955 --> 00:12:07.650
You want the wrench?
Go get the wrench.

180
00:12:07.823 --> 00:12:10.724
- Oh, look at that.
- Now, back to laughing.

181
00:12:20.403 --> 00:12:23.167
She's awake. Quick, to work.

182
00:12:33.015 --> 00:12:35.108
Miss Ritchi, we meet again.

183
00:12:35.251 --> 00:12:37.116
Would it kill you to wash the bag?

184
00:12:37.253 --> 00:12:39.380
You can scream all you wish,
Miss Ritchi.

185
00:12:39.555 --> 00:12:41.648
I'm afraid no one can hear you.

186
00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:45.286
Wh... Why isn't she screaming?

187
00:12:45.428 --> 00:12:47.089
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind?

188
00:12:47.296 --> 00:12:48.786
Like this...

189
00:12:48.964 --> 00:12:50.693
But that's, that's a poor lady scream.

190
00:12:52.468 --> 00:12:54.299
He's a little better.

191
00:12:56.972 --> 00:12:59.133
Is there some kind
of nerdy super-villain Web site

192
00:12:59.275 --> 00:13:02.142
where you get Tesla coils
and blinky dials?

193
00:13:02.311 --> 00:13:04.871
Actually, most of it comes
from an outlet store in...

194
00:13:05.047 --> 00:13:06.344
Don't answer that.

195
00:13:07.316 --> 00:13:09.477
- Romania.
- Don't! Stop!

196
00:13:09.618 --> 00:13:11.882
She's using her
nosy reporter skills

197
00:13:12.054 --> 00:13:15.490
on your weak-willed mind
to find out all our secrets.

198
00:13:17.226 --> 00:13:21.560
Such tricks won't work on me...

199
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.391
- Please talk slower.
- ...temptress.

200
00:13:23.566 --> 00:13:26.660
What secrets?
You're so predictable.

201
00:13:26.836 --> 00:13:28.827
Predictable? Predictable?

202
00:13:29.004 --> 00:13:32.599
Oh, you call this predictable?

203
00:13:32.775 --> 00:13:34.504
Your alligators. Yes.

204
00:13:35.377 --> 00:13:37.368
Yeah, I was thinking about it
on the way over.

205
00:13:38.514 --> 00:13:40.914
What's this? Boom! In your face.

206
00:13:41.851 --> 00:13:43.113
- Cliché.
- No! Look, watch.

207
00:13:44.687 --> 00:13:46.177
- Juvenile.
- Shock and awe.

208
00:13:46.856 --> 00:13:48.756
- Tacky.
- Oh, it's so scary!

209
00:13:48.924 --> 00:13:50.551
- Seen it.
- What's this one do?

210
00:13:50.726 --> 00:13:52.523
Garish.

211
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:55.687
- OK, the spider's new.
- Spider?

212
00:14:00.035 --> 00:14:03.004
Yes. The... The spee-ider.

213
00:14:03.239 --> 00:14:06.504
Even the smallest bite
from <i>Arachnis deathicus</i>

214
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:09.170
will instantly paralyze...

215
00:14:09.678 --> 00:14:11.373
Get it off! It bit me!

216
00:14:11.547 --> 00:14:13.811
Give it up, Megamind.
Your plans never work.

217
00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:18.743
Let's stop wasting time and call
your boyfriend in tights, shall we?

218
00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:26.227
It is with great pleasure that
I present to Metro Man his new museum.

219
00:14:26.395 --> 00:14:27.726
If you please.

220
00:14:33.569 --> 00:14:37.733
- Metro Man!
- Hey! My kid can't see.

221
00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:04.361
- Megamind!
<i>- Oh, bravo, Metro Man.</i>

222
00:15:06.435 --> 00:15:08.096
<i>Boo!</i>

223
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.103
<i>Yes, I can play along too. Boo!</i>

224
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.367
Should've known
you'd try to crash the party.

225
00:15:13.542 --> 00:15:15.703
<i>Oh, I intend to do more than crash it.</i>

226
00:15:15.878 --> 00:15:21.441
<i>This is a day you and Metrocity</i>
<i>shall not soon forget.</i>

227
00:15:21.617 --> 00:15:23.642
It's pronounced Metro City!

228
00:15:23.819 --> 00:15:26.686
<i>Potato-tomato, potato-tomato.</i>

229
00:15:26.855 --> 00:15:30.222
We all know how this ends:
With you behind bars.

230
00:15:30.392 --> 00:15:33.987
<i>I'm shaking in my custom</i>
<i>baby seal leather boots.</i>

231
00:15:34.163 --> 00:15:37.724
<i>You will leave Metrocity,</i>
<i>or this will be the last</i>

232
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.631
<i>you ever hear</i>
<i>of Roxanne Ritchi.</i>

233
00:15:41.804 --> 00:15:44.102
Roxanne! Don't panic, Roxie.

234
00:15:44.306 --> 00:15:46.103
- I'm on my way.
<i>- Yeah, I'm not panicking.</i>

235
00:15:46.308 --> 00:15:50.335
<i>In order to stop me,</i>
<i>you need to find me first, Metro Man.</i>

236
00:15:50.512 --> 00:15:52.002
<i>We're at the abandoned observatory.</i>

237
00:15:52.681 --> 00:15:54.205
<i>No, we're not!</i>

238
00:15:54.383 --> 00:15:56.408
<i>Don't listen to her. She's crazy.</i>

239
00:16:17.906 --> 00:16:19.703
Metro Man approaching, sir.

240
00:16:39.361 --> 00:16:40.919
Hold on a second.

241
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.963
Oh, good heavens!

242
00:16:50.139 --> 00:16:54.041
You didn't think you
were in the real observatory, did you?

243
00:16:59.648 --> 00:17:01.206
Ready the death ray, Minion.

244
00:17:01.383 --> 00:17:03.180
Death ray, readying.

245
00:17:07.423 --> 00:17:08.583
<i>Over here, old friend.</i>

246
00:17:08.757 --> 00:17:12.249
<i>In case you haven't noticed,</i>
<i>you've fallen right into my trap.</i>

247
00:17:12.428 --> 00:17:15.397
You can't trap justice.
It's an idea, a belief.

248
00:17:15.531 --> 00:17:18.762
<i>Even the most heartfelt belief</i>
<i>can be corroded over time.</i>

249
00:17:18.934 --> 00:17:20.401
Justice is a non-corrosive metal.

250
00:17:20.536 --> 00:17:23.061
<i>But metals can be melted</i>
<i>by the heat of revange.</i>

251
00:17:23.205 --> 00:17:25.139
It's "revenge,"
and it's best served cold.

252
00:17:25.307 --> 00:17:28.105
<i>But it can be easily reheated</i>
<i>in the microwave of evil.</i>

253
00:17:28.277 --> 00:17:30.268
Well, I think your warranty is
about to expire.

254
00:17:30.446 --> 00:17:31.606
<i>Maybe I got an extended warranty.</i>

255
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.408
Warranties are invalid if you don't use
the product for its intended purpose.

256
00:17:34.583 --> 00:17:37.677
Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty.
Can I go home now?

257
00:17:37.853 --> 00:17:41.254
<i>Of course. That is,</i>
<i>if Metro Man can withstand the full,</i>

258
00:17:41.423 --> 00:17:43.914
<i>concentrated power of the sun!</i>

259
00:17:44.927 --> 00:17:46.224
<i>Fire!</i>

260
00:17:55.971 --> 00:17:57.632
Minion. Fire?

261
00:17:57.806 --> 00:18:00.274
- It's still warming up, sir.
- Come again?

262
00:18:00.442 --> 00:18:03.809
- Warming up, sir.
- Warming up? The sun is warming up?

263
00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:08.109
One second more and...

264
00:18:08.283 --> 00:18:13.118
...just tippy-tappy tippy-tap-tap,
tip-top more,

265
00:18:13.288 --> 00:18:15.483
- and we are ready in just...
- Honestly!

266
00:18:15.657 --> 00:18:16.817
<i>On my way, Roxie.</i>

267
00:18:16.992 --> 00:18:20.086
I told you to have things ready.
I told you countless times.

268
00:18:20.295 --> 00:18:22.126
Why do you always blame me?

269
00:18:22.264 --> 00:18:24.129
My spider bite is acting up.

270
00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:26.564
Your plan is failing. Just admit it.

271
00:18:26.735 --> 00:18:28.134
Yeah, good luck with that one.

272
00:18:28.303 --> 00:18:29.668
Whose side are you on?

273
00:18:29.838 --> 00:18:31.669
- The losing side.
- Thank you.

274
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.570
Could someone stamp
my Frequent Kidnapping Card?

275
00:18:37.079 --> 00:18:40.879
You of all people know
we discontinued that promotion.

276
00:18:41.049 --> 00:18:42.983
- Ciao-ciao, all!
- Same time next week?

277
00:18:46.722 --> 00:18:48.053
<i>Dag! Crab nuggets!</i>

278
00:18:48.223 --> 00:18:50.817
- What did he just say?
- "Crab nuggets"?

279
00:18:51.693 --> 00:18:53.251
<i>Fackled fish cracker!</i>

280
00:18:53.429 --> 00:18:55.420
<i>Ten seconds to full power.</i>

281
00:18:55.597 --> 00:18:57.895
- Good lord, I'm trapped.
<i>- Ten...</i>

282
00:18:58.066 --> 00:18:59.897
<i>- What kind of trickery is this?</i>
<i>- ...nine...</i>

283
00:19:00.068 --> 00:19:01.763
- You mad genius.
<i>- ...eight...</i>

284
00:19:01.937 --> 00:19:04.667
- Your dark gift has finally paid off.
<i>- ...seven...</i>

285
00:19:04.807 --> 00:19:06.502
<i>- it... it has?</i>
<i>- ...six...</i>

286
00:19:06.675 --> 00:19:10.441
This dome is
obviously lined with copper.

287
00:19:10.612 --> 00:19:12.910
<i>- Yeah? So?</i>
- Sir...

288
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:15.447
- Copper drains my powers.
<i>- ...two...</i>

289
00:19:15.617 --> 00:19:18.017
<i>- Your weakness is copper?.</i>
<i>- ...one.</i>

290
00:19:18.153 --> 00:19:19.620
<i>- You're kidding, right?</i>
<i>- Full power.</i>

291
00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.211
I don't think
even he could survive that.

292
00:19:48.717 --> 00:19:52.380
Well, let's not get
our hopes up just yet.

293
00:19:53.222 --> 00:19:55.053
- Look!
- Metro Man!

294
00:19:55.824 --> 00:19:57.086
Metro Man.

295
00:19:57.259 --> 00:19:58.658
Metro Man!

296
00:20:13.542 --> 00:20:17.911
- You... You did it, sir.
- I did it?

297
00:20:21.483 --> 00:20:22.973
He did it.

298
00:20:23.151 --> 00:20:26.279
<i>- I did it?</i>
- He did it.

299
00:20:26.455 --> 00:20:27.786
- You did it, sir.
- I did it!

300
00:20:27.956 --> 00:20:31.949
- You did it!
- I did it! Metrocity is mine!

301
00:20:34.596 --> 00:20:36.996
- You did it, sir!
- I did it! Yeah, me, me!

302
00:20:37.165 --> 00:20:39.531
- Yes, I did it!
- Us! We both did it!

303
00:20:39.701 --> 00:20:41.498
- Not us! I!
- You, a little more

304
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.399
- than me but still, come on!
- A lot more than you.

305
00:20:43.605 --> 00:20:44.867
When they're giving out the awards,

306
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.474
- I'm gonna be right there next to you.
- What awards? What awards, for what?

307
00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.541
Hit it!

308
00:21:21.243 --> 00:21:22.232
Drop 'em!

309
00:21:50.772 --> 00:21:52.740
First off, what a turnout.

310
00:21:52.908 --> 00:21:54.899
How wild is this?

311
00:21:56.678 --> 00:22:00.671
All I did was eliminate the most
powerful man in the universe.

312
00:22:00.849 --> 00:22:04.580
Are there any questions?
Go on. Yes! You in the back.

313
00:22:04.753 --> 00:22:09.713
I'm sure we'd all like to know what
you plan to do with us and this city.

314
00:22:10.125 --> 00:22:11.524
Good, I'm glad you asked that.

315
00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.187
Imagine the most horrible, terrifying,

316
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:18.328
evil thing you can possibly think of,

317
00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:22.367
and multiply it... by six!

318
00:22:23.572 --> 00:22:25.005
In the meantime,

319
00:22:25.207 --> 00:22:28.404
I want you to carry on
with the dreary, normal things

320
00:22:28.577 --> 00:22:31.102
you normal people do.

321
00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:33.406
Let's just have fun with this. Come on.

322
00:22:33.582 --> 00:22:36.050
And I will get back to you.

323
00:22:41.089 --> 00:22:42.954
Now slam the door really hard.

324
00:22:45.027 --> 00:22:46.153
They... They can still see you.

325
00:22:46.328 --> 00:22:47.659
- Now?
- Your elbow's still in.

326
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:49.197
Good.

327
00:22:52.768 --> 00:22:57.171
<i>There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord.</i>

328
00:22:57.339 --> 00:23:00.900
Oh, Minion, did you think
this day would ever come?

329
00:23:01.076 --> 00:23:03.237
No way. Not at all, sir.

330
00:23:03.412 --> 00:23:05.403
Never. Never in a million...
I mean...

331
00:23:06.515 --> 00:23:09.609
- Yes, I did.
- Look at the intricate mouldings.

332
00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:11.650
I'm looking. I'm looking.

333
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.583
And what's this?

334
00:23:14.256 --> 00:23:16.781
It's like one of the giant monitors
in the lair.

335
00:23:17.693 --> 00:23:19.684
But it seems to only carry one station.

336
00:23:19.861 --> 00:23:23.024
Oh, that, sir, is called a window.

337
00:23:23.198 --> 00:23:25.666
- Window?
- All the kids are looking through them.

338
00:23:27.469 --> 00:23:29.528
I've never had a view before.

339
00:23:30.205 --> 00:23:33.003
Metrocity, Minion, it's all mine.

340
00:23:34.609 --> 00:23:36.509
If my parents could see me now.

341
00:23:36.678 --> 00:23:40.705
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down
from evil heaven.

342
00:23:41.283 --> 00:23:44.275
And now that Mr. Goody Two-Shoes is
out of the way,

343
00:23:44.453 --> 00:23:46.978
I can have everything I want,

344
00:23:47.155 --> 00:23:50.488
and there's no one to stop me!

345
00:24:33.068 --> 00:24:35.400
I know. I know.

346
00:24:36.171 --> 00:24:39.334
Always thirsty, never satisfied.

347
00:24:40.075 --> 00:24:42.509
I understand you,
little well-dressed bird.

348
00:24:43.712 --> 00:24:47.944
Purposeless, emptiness.
It's a vacuum, isn't it?

349
00:24:48.116 --> 00:24:50.812
It's... What's your vacuum like?

350
00:24:55.056 --> 00:24:57.786
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Not now, Minion.

351
00:24:59.761 --> 00:25:02.059
I'm in a heated,
existential discussion

352
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.858
with this dead-eyed, plastic desk toy.

353
00:25:08.136 --> 00:25:10.604
Is... Is something wrong, sir?

354
00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.970
Just think about it.

355
00:25:14.142 --> 00:25:15.700
We have it all.

356
00:25:16.978 --> 00:25:18.411
Yet, we have nothing.

357
00:25:20.415 --> 00:25:21.905
It's just too easy now.

358
00:25:23.285 --> 00:25:24.775
I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir.

359
00:25:26.388 --> 00:25:29.289
I mean, we did it, right?

360
00:25:29.457 --> 00:25:31.721
Well, you did it, sir.

361
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.385
Yes, you've made that perfectly clear.

362
00:25:34.563 --> 00:25:38.465
Then why do I feel so... mel-on-choly.

363
00:25:38.633 --> 00:25:40.123
"Mel-on-choly"?

364
00:25:40.302 --> 00:25:42.930
- Unhappy.
- Well...

365
00:25:43.672 --> 00:25:45.697
What if tomorrow,

366
00:25:45.907 --> 00:25:48.273
we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.

367
00:25:48.443 --> 00:25:50.377
That always seems to lift your spirits.

368
00:25:52.981 --> 00:25:57.042
Good idea, Minion.
But without him, what's the point?

369
00:25:57.853 --> 00:26:00.185
- "Him, " sir?
- Nothing.

370
00:26:01.423 --> 00:26:04.915
OK, all right. We'll just...
that's something to consider...

371
00:26:05.093 --> 00:26:09.086
...and... Well, I think I'll just
power down for a while then.

372
00:26:16.304 --> 00:26:20.070
<i>He was always there for us. Dependable.</i>

373
00:26:21.943 --> 00:26:24.741
<i>Perhaps we took him for granted.</i>
<i>You know, maybe,</i>

374
00:26:24.946 --> 00:26:28.109
<i>we never really know how good</i>
<i>we have it until it's gone.</i>

375
00:26:29.517 --> 00:26:33.180
<i>We miss you, Metro Man. I miss you.</i>

376
00:26:34.289 --> 00:26:38.783
<i>And I have just one question</i>
<i>for Megamind: Are you happy now?</i>

377
00:26:41.963 --> 00:26:44.830
<i>This is Roxanne Ritchi,</i>
<i>reporting from a city without a hero.</i>

378
00:26:46.268 --> 00:26:50.705
<i>Coming up next, are you ready to be</i>
<i>a slave army? What you need to know.</i>

379
00:26:56.544 --> 00:27:01.174
And... wrap that up and give it
to a child on Christmas,

380
00:27:01.349 --> 00:27:04.147
- 'cause we're done.
- OK. See you tomorrow, Hal.

381
00:27:04.286 --> 00:27:07.414
Wait. Roxie, I'm having a party
at my house.

382
00:27:07.589 --> 00:27:09.352
It's gonna be, like,
off the hook, or whatever.

383
00:27:09.524 --> 00:27:11.185
You should come over.
I got a deejay,

384
00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:13.224
rented a bouncy house,
made a gallon of dip.

385
00:27:13.395 --> 00:27:14.362
It's gonna be sick.

386
00:27:14.529 --> 00:27:16.121
Oh. I... I don't know, Hal.

387
00:27:16.331 --> 00:27:18.322
I don't really feel like being
around a bunch of people.

388
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.491
No, no, no, that's the best part.
It'll just be like you and me.

389
00:27:22.804 --> 00:27:26.296
Wow. That... that's certainly
very tempting, but...

390
00:27:26.508 --> 00:27:29.875
I did hire a wedding photographer.
That's just in case we were like,

391
00:27:30.045 --> 00:27:31.740
something crazy happened
and we wanted a picture of it.

392
00:27:31.913 --> 00:27:35.349
Like, maybe we should have this for,
like, ever. Like a memory, you know?

393
00:27:35.951 --> 00:27:37.282
I'm gonna pass.

394
00:27:37.652 --> 00:27:40.120
I have some work here
that I need to do, anyway.

395
00:27:40.288 --> 00:27:42.518
Cool. So Thursday? Soft Thursday?

396
00:27:42.691 --> 00:27:44.955
- Good night, Hal.
- That's a soft yes on Thursday.

397
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:49.860
What's wrong with me?
Rented a bouncy house?

398
00:27:49.998 --> 00:27:51.727
Chicks don't like bouncy houses.

399
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.492
They like clowns.

400
00:27:54.903 --> 00:27:57.633
Stupid van! You broke my finger!

401
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:36.975
I've made a horrible mistake.

402
00:28:37.712 --> 00:28:39.577
I didn't mean to destroy you.

403
00:28:39.714 --> 00:28:42.581
I mean, I meant to destroy you,

404
00:28:42.751 --> 00:28:44.844
but I didn't think
it would really work.

405
00:28:45.253 --> 00:28:47.448
What are we supposed to do?

406
00:28:47.622 --> 00:28:51.285
Without you, evil is running rampant
through the streets.

407
00:28:51.459 --> 00:28:54.986
I'm so tired of running rampant
through the streets.

408
00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.090
What's the point of being bad

409
00:28:57.232 --> 00:28:59.496
when there's no good
to try and stop you?

410
00:29:00.635 --> 00:29:02.398
Someone has to stop Megamind.

411
00:29:02.604 --> 00:29:05.198
- Hey, we're closing soon.
- You scared me.

412
00:29:05.373 --> 00:29:06.704
- Barry, right?
- Bernard.

413
00:29:06.875 --> 00:29:11.175
Bernard. I was just...
Well, I was talking to myself.

414
00:29:11.346 --> 00:29:12.938
You probably think
I'm a little bit nuts.

415
00:29:13.081 --> 00:29:14.878
I'm not allowed to insult
guests directly.

416
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:17.951
Thank you. Just...
Bernard, I'll just be another minute.

417
00:29:19.754 --> 00:29:20.721
OK.

418
00:29:20.889 --> 00:29:21.913
Thanks.

419
00:29:22.123 --> 00:29:25.490
I had so many evil plans in the works.

420
00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.890
The illiteracy beam.

421
00:29:28.063 --> 00:29:29.724
Typhoon cheese.

422
00:29:29.898 --> 00:29:31.559
Robo-sheep.

423
00:29:31.733 --> 00:29:33.496
Battles we will now never have.

424
00:29:37.338 --> 00:29:39.738
You know,
I never had the chance to say goodbye.

425
00:29:40.875 --> 00:29:43.207
So it's good
that we have this time now.

426
00:29:43.378 --> 00:29:45.437
You know, before I destroy the place.

427
00:29:45.647 --> 00:29:48.878
Nothing personal, it just brings back
too many painful memories.

428
00:29:53.021 --> 00:29:54.147
Hello?

429
00:29:54.322 --> 00:29:56.290
- Hello?
- Roxanne.

430
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.569
- That's a pretty tasteless costume.
- Costume?

431
00:30:08.736 --> 00:30:11.500
Megamind's head is not
that grossly exaggerated.

432
00:30:13.508 --> 00:30:16.807
And you even made a cheap replica
of his dehydration gun. How...

433
00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.580
Hello? Is someone there?

434
00:30:23.351 --> 00:30:25.182
Hello? Who's there?

435
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:29.447
It's just you, Bernard.

436
00:30:29.624 --> 00:30:32.593
Yes. It's just me. Bernard.

437
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.625
Well, thank you
for letting me stay.

438
00:30:34.796 --> 00:30:37.264
Look, I wouldn't stay here for more than
two minutes and 37 seconds

439
00:30:37.432 --> 00:30:40.026
if I were you. We're having
the walls and ceiling removed.

440
00:30:40.201 --> 00:30:42.396
Wow, that sounds like quite
the renovation.

441
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.198
I guess I'll catch
a ride down with you then.

442
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.611
I kept thinking he was gonna do
one of his last-minute escapes.

443
00:30:56.351 --> 00:30:59.081
Yeah. He was really good at those.

444
00:30:59.554 --> 00:31:01.954
Oh, if only the world had
a reset button.

445
00:31:02.457 --> 00:31:05.017
I've looked into the reset button.

446
00:31:05.226 --> 00:31:06.887
The science is impossible.

447
00:31:08.196 --> 00:31:09.686
Oh, Bernard...

448
00:31:09.898 --> 00:31:13.595
I didn't know you had... feelings.
Are you OK?

449
00:31:14.736 --> 00:31:19.105
Metro Man's gone. And now there's
no one left to challenge Megamind.

450
00:31:19.274 --> 00:31:21.538
Oh, come on, Bernard.

451
00:31:21.743 --> 00:31:24.405
As long as there's evil,
good will rise up against it.

452
00:31:24.546 --> 00:31:25.808
Oh, I wish.

453
00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.676
I believe someone is gonna stand up
to Megamind.

454
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.182
- You really think so?
- Yeah. I mean, it's like they say,

455
00:31:31.352 --> 00:31:33.843
"Heroes aren't born, they're made."

456
00:31:36.858 --> 00:31:40.316
Heroes can be made. That's it!

457
00:31:40.495 --> 00:31:42.520
All you need are
the right ingredients.

458
00:31:42.697 --> 00:31:44.631
- Yeah. Bravery.
- Yes.

459
00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:45.788
- Strength.
- Of course.

460
00:31:45.967 --> 00:31:48.162
- Determination.
- Imperative!

461
00:31:48.336 --> 00:31:52.329
And a smidgen of DNA.
Oh, with that, anyone can be a hero!

462
00:31:52.507 --> 00:31:53.872
Yeah!

463
00:31:54.776 --> 00:31:56.107
I think we should run!

464
00:31:56.277 --> 00:31:57.835
Bye!

465
00:31:59.214 --> 00:32:01.774
Time to put the past behind us.

466
00:32:02.784 --> 00:32:04.149
Only the future...

467
00:32:04.953 --> 00:32:07.683
I'm too close!
I'm genuinely scared right now.

468
00:32:08.189 --> 00:32:09.816
I hope no one's seeing this!

469
00:32:10.658 --> 00:32:13.650
Create a hero? Wait, wait, what?
Why would you do that?

470
00:32:13.828 --> 00:32:15.659
So I have someone to fight.

471
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:18.321
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.

472
00:32:18.733 --> 00:32:20.360
A yin with no yang.

473
00:32:20.535 --> 00:32:22.469
A bullfighter with no bull to fight.

474
00:32:22.604 --> 00:32:25.095
In other words, I have no purpose.

475
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.403
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it.
Go on! Ask!

476
00:32:30.078 --> 00:32:32.069
How are you gonna do it?

477
00:32:33.281 --> 00:32:35.647
I'm going to give someone...
I don't know who yet...

478
00:32:35.817 --> 00:32:37.307
Metro Man's powers.

479
00:32:37.452 --> 00:32:41.582
I'm going to train that someone
to become Metrocity's new hero.

480
00:32:41.756 --> 00:32:42.814
Over here! Follow!

481
00:32:43.358 --> 00:32:45.485
And then finally,
I'm going to fight that hero

482
00:32:45.627 --> 00:32:48.357
in an epic battle of good and evil.

483
00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:51.225
Which will put everything back
the way it was...

484
00:32:51.733 --> 00:32:54.702
...when the world was
perfect and rosy.

485
00:32:54.869 --> 00:32:58.270
Behold, Minion, Metro Man's cape.

486
00:32:58.439 --> 00:33:00.873
Look closely. Tell me what you see.

487
00:33:01.042 --> 00:33:04.773
- Dandruff?
- Yes. It's his DNA.

488
00:33:05.246 --> 00:33:09.774
From this, we'll extract the source
of Metro Man's awesome power.

489
00:33:12.186 --> 00:33:14.780
Sir, I think this is a bad idea.

490
00:33:14.956 --> 00:33:19.359
Yes! This is a very wickedly bad idea
for the greater good of man.

491
00:33:19.494 --> 00:33:22.361
But I'm saying this is
a kind of bad that...

492
00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:25.397
...OK, you might think is good
in your bad perception,

493
00:33:25.566 --> 00:33:28.535
but from a good perception it...
it's just plain bad.

494
00:33:28.703 --> 00:33:31.228
Oh, you don't know
what's good for bad.

495
00:33:32.106 --> 00:33:34.574
Now, we have just one shot at this.

496
00:33:34.742 --> 00:33:39.145
We must find a suitable subject,
someone of noble heart and mind.

497
00:33:40.415 --> 00:33:43.873
Who puts the welfare of others
above their own.

498
00:33:46.087 --> 00:33:47.611
What on Earth is that?

499
00:33:47.789 --> 00:33:51.225
It seems to be emanating
from there, sir.

500
00:33:53.961 --> 00:33:54.928
Ollo.

501
00:33:55.096 --> 00:33:56.393
It's "Hello."

502
00:33:56.531 --> 00:33:57.896
Hello? Like that?

503
00:33:58.032 --> 00:34:00.398
<i>- Bernard, it's Roxanne.</i>
- It's Roxanne.

504
00:34:00.568 --> 00:34:02.559
<i>I just wanted to thank you</i>
<i>for inspiring me the other day.</i>

505
00:34:02.704 --> 00:34:05.264
- Oh, you inspired me too.
<i>- Great!</i>

506
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.841
<i>It's time we stood up to Megamind</i>
<i>and show him he can't push us around.</i>

507
00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:11.001
Oh, really? She's so cute.

508
00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.477
<i>I'm already hot on his trail.</i>

509
00:34:13.648 --> 00:34:15.912
- And what gives you that idea?
- Sir?

510
00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:17.779
<i>I just found his secret hideout.</i>

511
00:34:17.952 --> 00:34:19.544
How did she find my hideout?!

512
00:34:20.488 --> 00:34:23.150
How did you find his hideout?

513
00:34:23.324 --> 00:34:27.624
This is the only building in Metro City
with a fake observatory on the roof.

514
00:34:29.964 --> 00:34:32.626
OK. There's no way
she'll find the secret entrance.

515
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.826
<i>There's a doormat here</i>
<i>that says "Secrit Entrance"!</i>

516
00:34:37.939 --> 00:34:39.873
- Minion!
- I kept forgetting where it was.

517
00:34:40.041 --> 00:34:41.668
She'll discover all our secrets!

518
00:34:41.843 --> 00:34:44.539
- Oh, no!
- You dim-witted creation of science!

519
00:34:44.712 --> 00:34:46.202
<i>- What?</i>
- What? Oh, no, not you, Roxanne.

520
00:34:46.381 --> 00:34:48.849
No, I was just yelling at my...
mother's urn.

521
00:34:49.016 --> 00:34:50.677
Don't do anything.
I'll be right there.

522
00:34:51.319 --> 00:34:53.310
Roxanne?

523
00:34:53.488 --> 00:34:54.955
Oh no, not again!

524
00:35:01.362 --> 00:35:02.556
Roxanne?

525
00:35:04.031 --> 00:35:06.499
I'm glad you're here.
Wait, how did you get here so fast?

526
00:35:06.667 --> 00:35:10.296
Well, I... I happened to be
speed walking nearby when you called.

527
00:35:10.438 --> 00:35:11.564
In a suit?

528
00:35:11.739 --> 00:35:15.300
It's called... formal speed walking,
but that's not important.

529
00:35:15.476 --> 00:35:17.603
I better take the lead.
This way looks exciting.

530
00:35:17.812 --> 00:35:19.109
No, it says "Exit."

531
00:35:19.313 --> 00:35:21.975
Which is the abbreviation
for "exciting, " right?

532
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:24.414
This is the mother lode!

533
00:35:24.585 --> 00:35:27.349
- Wow. Just look at this thing.
- Wow.

534
00:35:27.522 --> 00:35:30.047
You know, I really could use
your help in deciphering all this.

535
00:35:30.224 --> 00:35:31.589
- Really?
- You're an expert

536
00:35:31.759 --> 00:35:34.227
- on all things Megamind, right?
- Yes. Right.

537
00:35:34.395 --> 00:35:38.126
Together, we could figure out his plan
for the city and stop it.

538
00:35:38.499 --> 00:35:40.990
- Are you in?
- Oh, what fun!

539
00:35:41.169 --> 00:35:42.227
That's what I want to hear.

540
00:35:42.403 --> 00:35:44.496
Minion, Code: Send In The Brain-bots.

541
00:35:44.672 --> 00:35:46.697
You know,
the whole point of a code is...

542
00:35:46.874 --> 00:35:48.865
Oh, Code: Just Do it, Minion.

543
00:35:49.043 --> 00:35:51.477
<i>Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!</i>

544
00:35:52.246 --> 00:35:55.010
- It's me, you fools!
- Bernard!

545
00:35:57.351 --> 00:35:58.648
It's Daddy!

546
00:36:01.289 --> 00:36:02.517
Megamind.

547
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.215
- What have you done with Bernard?
- Oh, Bernard? Oh, yes.

548
00:36:05.393 --> 00:36:07.452
I'm doing horrible things to that man.

549
00:36:07.628 --> 00:36:10.096
I don't want to get into it,
but lasers, spikes.

550
00:36:10.264 --> 00:36:13.495
No, please! No!
Not the lasers and the spikes!

551
00:36:13.701 --> 00:36:16.864
- You know the drill.
- Oh, no! Not the drill!

552
00:36:17.038 --> 00:36:19.438
- Let him go or...
- Or what?

553
00:36:19.607 --> 00:36:21.700
Or I'm gonna find out
what this weird-looking gun does.

554
00:36:21.843 --> 00:36:24.141
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot that gun!

555
00:36:24.312 --> 00:36:25.745
I'll just go get him.

556
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.373
- Unhand me, you fiend!
- Never!

557
00:36:28.516 --> 00:36:30.746
His strength's too much!

558
00:36:30.918 --> 00:36:33.284
Oh, I work out!

559
00:36:33.454 --> 00:36:36.116
Well, it's really paying off!
You're so fit,

560
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:38.383
and strangely charismatic.

561
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.162
Are you OK?

562
00:36:43.331 --> 00:36:46.164
I did my best, but he's too fantastic.

563
00:36:46.334 --> 00:36:48.393
Here. Let me carry
that heavy gun for you.

564
00:36:48.536 --> 00:36:50.003
I got us covered.

565
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.265
- Let go. It's mine!
- Bernard, run!

566
00:36:56.577 --> 00:36:57.635
<i>Roxanne?</i>

567
00:36:57.812 --> 00:36:59.609
- You're going to break it!
- Give it to me!

568
00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.441
Oh, no!

569
00:37:06.187 --> 00:37:07.677
Roxanne?!

570
00:37:13.461 --> 00:37:15.156
Who on Earth is that?

571
00:37:24.972 --> 00:37:26.303
- Help!
- Roxanne!

572
00:37:27.475 --> 00:37:29.875
Bernard! You were right
about that door being exciting.

573
00:37:30.044 --> 00:37:31.443
<i>- Intruder! Intruder!</i>
- This way.

574
00:37:31.579 --> 00:37:33.069
<i>Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!</i>

575
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:38.318
What are you doing?

576
00:37:38.486 --> 00:37:40.317
This'll stop them. Here!

577
00:37:40.488 --> 00:37:42.285
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?

578
00:37:44.191 --> 00:37:46.887
- Just throw it!
- Daddy's sorry.

579
00:37:57.972 --> 00:38:00.372
- Wow. That was really exciting.
- Yeah.

580
00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:02.133
- You were very strong in there.
- I know.

581
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:05.143
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man
stand up to him like that.

582
00:38:05.313 --> 00:38:07.372
- What's going on?
- Hal, what happened?

583
00:38:07.548 --> 00:38:09.311
I think a bee flew up my nose.

584
00:38:09.483 --> 00:38:12.111
I was just about to make
my frontal assault to rescue you,

585
00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.983
but like 50 ninjas tried to attack me,
so I had to beat 'em all up,

586
00:38:16.157 --> 00:38:18.057
and I did, and I... They were all,
like, crying and stuff...

587
00:38:18.225 --> 00:38:21.388
- Wow, a brave one, isn't he?
- Who are you?

588
00:38:21.562 --> 00:38:23.689
Oh, thi... this is Bernard.
He's my partner.

589
00:38:23.864 --> 00:38:26.230
- Partner?
- Yes. Yes. Partner.

590
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.496
Well, look, "partner, " I'm her partner.
She doesn't know what she's saying.

591
00:38:30.638 --> 00:38:32.003
She's been through
a traumatic experience.

592
00:38:32.139 --> 00:38:34.607
I'd better take him home.
Thanks again, Bernard.

593
00:38:41.882 --> 00:38:43.850
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.

594
00:38:44.552 --> 00:38:46.349
Yeah, OK. I'd like that.

595
00:38:46.487 --> 00:38:48.148
That was weird for everybody,

596
00:38:48.356 --> 00:38:50.347
'cause you accidentally hugged him
instead of me.

597
00:38:50.524 --> 00:38:52.754
<i>Sir? Sir!</i>

598
00:38:52.927 --> 00:38:55.327
<i>Code: Did You Find Out Who it Was?</i>

599
00:38:58.532 --> 00:39:00.090
Code: Get The Car.

600
00:39:00.267 --> 00:39:01.427
<i>Code: Right Away, Sir.</i>

601
00:39:09.977 --> 00:39:11.672
- Bye-bye!
- See you tomorrow, Hal.

602
00:39:11.879 --> 00:39:14.245
I'll leave the door unlocked in case
you want to check on me later.

603
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:20.478
Who is this man
we've infused with godlike power?

604
00:39:23.924 --> 00:39:27.223
Well, sir, his name's Hal Stewart.
He's 28 years old.

605
00:39:27.395 --> 00:39:29.659
No criminal record.
Actually no records at all.

606
00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:32.390
Apparently this man hasn't
accomplished anything.

607
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.365
Not yet, Minion. Not... yet.

608
00:39:36.871 --> 00:39:39.339
Could this day get any more fun-tastic?

609
00:39:39.507 --> 00:39:44.501
So, I will just go ahead and diffuse him
since this is clearly a mistake.

610
00:39:44.679 --> 00:39:47.648
No, Minion! There's something
much more powerful at work here.

611
00:39:48.115 --> 00:39:51.346
This is no mistake. It's destiny.

612
00:39:53.354 --> 00:39:56.983
Hal Shtewart! Prepare for your destiny!

613
00:39:57.692 --> 00:39:59.489
Hal? Hal Shtewart?

614
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.423
- Hey! In the bed!
- Am I saying it right?

615
00:40:01.562 --> 00:40:02.927
"Stewart."

616
00:40:03.798 --> 00:40:04.856
Is this a robbery?

617
00:40:05.032 --> 00:40:07.432
'Cause the lady across the hall
has way better stuff than me.

618
00:40:07.601 --> 00:40:10.729
Oh, look, it's Hal Stewart.
Quick, the spray.

619
00:40:12.239 --> 00:40:13.228
All out.

620
00:40:13.441 --> 00:40:15.602
- Well, use the Forget-Me Stick.
- Oh, right.

621
00:40:18.646 --> 00:40:19.908
Just look at him.

622
00:40:21.782 --> 00:40:24.546
No, he doesn't look quite
the hero-type to me.

623
00:40:24.719 --> 00:40:26.448
Oh, you're such a pill, Minion.

624
00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:29.614
A potter couldn't ask for finer clay.

625
00:40:30.958 --> 00:40:32.152
I smell a hero.

626
00:40:32.326 --> 00:40:34.692
I smell something burning.

627
00:40:34.862 --> 00:40:36.887
I think it's working. Places! Places!

628
00:40:37.064 --> 00:40:39.191
Places! Places! Places.

629
00:40:39.366 --> 00:40:40.697
Do you have your disguise?

630
00:40:47.675 --> 00:40:48.664
What?

631
00:40:49.176 --> 00:40:50.473
Oh, you look fantastic.

632
00:41:00.387 --> 00:41:02.855
Rise my glorious creation.

633
00:41:03.023 --> 00:41:05.821
Rise, and come to Papa.

634
00:41:06.127 --> 00:41:09.187
- What's going on?
- Easy my child.

635
00:41:09.363 --> 00:41:11.593
- Who are you?
- I sent you to this planet

636
00:41:11.766 --> 00:41:15.668
to teach you about justice,
honor, and nobility.

637
00:41:16.237 --> 00:41:17.966
I am your father.

638
00:41:18.873 --> 00:41:21.103
So you're like my space dad?

639
00:41:22.009 --> 00:41:25.001
Yeah, I'm like your space dad.

640
00:41:25.446 --> 00:41:27.277
And you are what?

641
00:41:28.182 --> 00:41:30.173
I'm your space stepmom.

642
00:41:31.519 --> 00:41:33.248
I've had some
work done recently.

643
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.217
Is this some kind of dream?

644
00:41:35.389 --> 00:41:37.448
This is a dream come true.

645
00:41:37.625 --> 00:41:40.788
You've been blessed
with unfathomable power.

646
00:41:40.961 --> 00:41:42.861
- What kind of power?
- Unfathomable.

647
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.362
It's unf... without fathom.

648
00:41:46.634 --> 00:41:48.761
Yeah. We've come to guide you

649
00:41:48.936 --> 00:41:52.633
on your path
to be Metrocity's new hero

650
00:41:52.807 --> 00:41:56.971
and battle the super-genius
of Megamind.

651
00:42:00.247 --> 00:42:02.272
I know this is a lot to take in.

652
00:42:02.449 --> 00:42:04.542
It may take months
for you to come to grips.

653
00:42:04.685 --> 00:42:06.482
No freaking way!

654
00:42:06.654 --> 00:42:08.485
I wasn't finished.

655
00:42:11.826 --> 00:42:13.726
I'm gonna be a hero!

656
00:42:13.894 --> 00:42:16.522
I'm gonna be a hero!

657
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.528
See, Minion, he's perfect!

658
00:42:21.068 --> 00:42:23.161
And... action!

659
00:42:23.337 --> 00:42:25.999
- Someone help me!
- I'm OK!

660
00:42:30.744 --> 00:42:32.871
You... Bad!

661
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.741
Zap! Zap! Zap!

662
00:42:38.018 --> 00:42:40.612
The flames of my evil burn bright.

663
00:42:40.788 --> 00:42:42.346
Now you say something cool
back at me.

664
00:42:42.523 --> 00:42:45.515
Look. It doesn't even hurt.
Don't even feel it.

665
00:42:45.693 --> 00:42:50.357
No, no, no, no, no. Stomach down,
hands up. Like Metro Man.

666
00:42:50.531 --> 00:42:53.398
- Whoa! Wait!
- Watch out.

667
00:42:56.203 --> 00:42:59.001
He's hopeless. Hopeless!

668
00:42:59.173 --> 00:43:01.733
- Maybe we should change tactics.
- You think so?

669
00:43:01.942 --> 00:43:03.466
Oh, you know how boys are.

670
00:43:03.644 --> 00:43:04.975
They love video games.

671
00:43:05.145 --> 00:43:07.705
- I could throw a few parts together.
- Can't wait.

672
00:43:07.882 --> 00:43:10.715
LOL. Smiley face.

673
00:43:10.885 --> 00:43:12.182
Can't wait for what, sir?

674
00:43:13.487 --> 00:43:15.318
That was such a funny story.

675
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:18.187
And brilliantly told, by the way.

676
00:43:18.359 --> 00:43:19.883
OK, now you tell one.

677
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.528
Bernard, I never knew
you were so funny.

678
00:43:22.696 --> 00:43:25.130
And I never heard you laugh before.

679
00:43:25.266 --> 00:43:28.429
Yeah, it's been a while.
Feels pretty good.

680
00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.007
And action.

681
00:43:37.678 --> 00:43:39.407
Gotcha!

682
00:43:46.887 --> 00:43:49.412
- You don't get out much, do you?
- Oh, what fun!

683
00:43:51.592 --> 00:43:53.719
I used to come here
with my mother when I was a kid.

684
00:43:54.628 --> 00:43:56.562
It was one of my favorite things to do.

685
00:43:57.331 --> 00:43:59.993
Now look at it. It's a dump.

686
00:44:04.872 --> 00:44:06.806
Why are we cleaning up the city, sir?

687
00:44:07.007 --> 00:44:11.444
Well, we don't want to battle
our new hero in a dump now, do we?

688
00:44:15.649 --> 00:44:18.516
They're all back. But how? Why?

689
00:44:18.919 --> 00:44:21.046
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.

690
00:44:26.627 --> 00:44:27.616
That's it.

691
00:44:27.795 --> 00:44:31.196
Be free, my beautiful dove!

692
00:44:35.669 --> 00:44:37.102
OK, OK.

693
00:44:37.271 --> 00:44:40.536
Metro Man and I were never a couple.

694
00:44:40.708 --> 00:44:42.801
- But I thought you two were...
- I know. Everybody did.

695
00:44:42.977 --> 00:44:45.639
It's just...
Well, he was never really my type.

696
00:44:45.813 --> 00:44:47.110
Really?

697
00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:49.306
OK, now you tell me something.

698
00:44:49.483 --> 00:44:52.213
Something you've never told anyone.

699
00:44:53.087 --> 00:44:56.488
Well, in sh... school...

700
00:44:57.758 --> 00:45:00.386
...none of the other kids
really liked me.

701
00:45:01.729 --> 00:45:03.822
I was always the last one picked
for everything.

702
00:45:05.265 --> 00:45:08.234
It's too bad that we didn't go
to the same school.

703
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.473
Hal, I think you're ready for this.

704
00:45:18.846 --> 00:45:21.576
- Do I have a son?
- No.

705
00:45:21.749 --> 00:45:23.376
You make me laugh.

706
00:45:23.584 --> 00:45:25.518
It stretches. It's for you.

707
00:45:26.754 --> 00:45:28.312
Hey, what's the T stand for?

708
00:45:28.489 --> 00:45:29.820
Titan.

709
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:31.924
"Titan"?
What's that supposed to mean?

710
00:45:32.059 --> 00:45:34.619
It was the only name
I could trademark.

711
00:45:36.697 --> 00:45:39.666
Do you have someone special
in your life, Hal?

712
00:45:40.034 --> 00:45:43.868
No, not yet. But... there's this
really, really good-looking one

713
00:45:44.038 --> 00:45:46.131
I've got my eye on currently.

714
00:45:50.677 --> 00:45:52.645
That's very good.

715
00:45:52.813 --> 00:45:56.112
- Romance is very inspiring.
- That's what I hear.

716
00:45:56.250 --> 00:46:01.153
All you have to do is
save her and she'll be yours.

717
00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:02.913
- Who wants churros?
- I do!

718
00:46:03.123 --> 00:46:06.183
- I do, yeah. Thanks, Space Stepmom.
- Churros all the way around.

719
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.954
On the count of three,
unsheathe your churro.

720
00:46:09.096 --> 00:46:10.723
One, two, three!

721
00:46:10.898 --> 00:46:12.024
To Titan!

722
00:46:12.232 --> 00:46:17.363
Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind,
and the city will know your name.

723
00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.031
<i>...the city's parks restored</i>
<i>to their original glory,</i>

724
00:46:22.209 --> 00:46:26.077
<i>the streets the safest they've been,</i>
<i>the banks reopened.</i>

725
00:46:26.246 --> 00:46:28.180
<i>Has something happened to Megamind?</i>

726
00:46:28.348 --> 00:46:31.044
<i>Has someone tamed this monster?.</i>

727
00:46:31.218 --> 00:46:34.381
<i>This is Roxanne Ritchi,</i>
<i>cautiously optimistic,</i>

728
00:46:34.555 --> 00:46:36.580
<i>and pleasantly confused.</i>

729
00:46:36.757 --> 00:46:38.748
Well, you seem
in a very good mood tonight, sir.

730
00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.590
Oh, yes. How long is
this going to take, Minion?

731
00:46:42.763 --> 00:46:44.663
Just a few alterations, sir,
and I will be done

732
00:46:44.832 --> 00:46:46.959
with your most terrifying cape yet!

733
00:46:47.134 --> 00:46:48.499
I'm calling it...

734
00:46:48.836 --> 00:46:52.863
...the Black Mamba...

735
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.667
Black Mamba. Perfect.

736
00:46:55.209 --> 00:46:57.575
Gosh, I am running late.
I have to go.

737
00:46:57.744 --> 00:46:59.803
What? Where...
Where are you going, sir?

738
00:47:00.013 --> 00:47:02.243
We have our debut battle
with Titan tomorrow morning.

739
00:47:02.416 --> 00:47:04.384
We haven't even tested
your big battle suit yet.

740
00:47:04.551 --> 00:47:08.453
You attend to the details, Minion.
I have to... run a quick errand.

741
00:47:08.856 --> 00:47:10.881
You don't run errands.

742
00:47:11.058 --> 00:47:12.355
- What's going on here?
- What?

743
00:47:12.526 --> 00:47:13.754
Oh, wait a minute.

744
00:47:15.095 --> 00:47:18.462
Are you wearing
Jean Paul Gaultier's <i>Pour Homme?</i>

745
00:47:18.632 --> 00:47:21.999
It's just my natural musk.
Now, where are the car keys?

746
00:47:24.571 --> 00:47:26.562
This is about Ms. Ritchi,
isn't it?

747
00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.173
You're going on a date with her.

748
00:47:29.376 --> 00:47:32.868
No, my main man.
Get out of town.

749
00:47:33.046 --> 00:47:36.709
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.
You've fallen in love with her.

750
00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:40.251
You are forgetting your place, Minion.
Now give me the keys.

751
00:47:42.389 --> 00:47:45.415
What happens when Roxanne
finds out who you really are?

752
00:47:45.592 --> 00:47:49.050
She will never find out.
That's the point of lying.

753
00:47:51.064 --> 00:47:52.691
Honestly, if I didn't know
any better,

754
00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.800
I'd think this was
your first day of being evil.

755
00:47:54.968 --> 00:47:56.367
No!

756
00:47:57.471 --> 00:47:59.803
This has gone far enough!

757
00:48:00.908 --> 00:48:02.967
Oh, that was really grown-up!

758
00:48:04.745 --> 00:48:07.213
Sir, sir, please.
It's for your own good.

759
00:48:07.414 --> 00:48:08.813
Oh, what do you know?

760
00:48:08.982 --> 00:48:11.212
I may not know much,
but I do know this:

761
00:48:11.418 --> 00:48:14.114
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.

762
00:48:14.288 --> 00:48:17.086
Maybe I don't want to be
the bad guy anymore.

763
00:48:20.827 --> 00:48:22.260
You heard me!

764
00:48:22.629 --> 00:48:24.153
Who are you?

765
00:48:24.965 --> 00:48:27.195
- Now, give me the keys!
- No!

766
00:48:28.435 --> 00:48:30.869
My sole purpose in life is
to look after you.

767
00:48:31.038 --> 00:48:33.029
Well, I don't need you
to look after me.

768
00:48:33.207 --> 00:48:36.472
What are you s... What are you saying?
You don't need me?

769
00:48:36.643 --> 00:48:40.204
Let me make it clear.
Code: I Don't Need You.

770
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.211
You know what? You know what?

771
00:48:44.885 --> 00:48:47.251
Code: I'll Just Pack My Thing And Go!

772
00:48:47.454 --> 00:48:50.218
- Code: Fine!
- Code: Fine Back!

773
00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:56.322
- Well, good luck on your date!
- I will!

774
00:48:56.496 --> 00:48:59.192
- That doesn't even make any sense!
- I know!

775
00:49:30.998 --> 00:49:33.558
I know I am so close. I can feel it.

776
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:39.835
OK, OK. I just have
to take a step back.

777
00:49:46.113 --> 00:49:47.171
Wait a minute.

778
00:50:00.227 --> 00:50:01.751
"Titan."

779
00:50:01.928 --> 00:50:06.058
- What's a Titan?
- My super-ears are burning.

780
00:50:08.035 --> 00:50:11.300
I usually just hear criminals.
You haven't been naughty, have you?

781
00:50:12.205 --> 00:50:14.400
I'm totally messing with you.
I'm totally messing with you.

782
00:50:14.574 --> 00:50:17.236
- The name's Titan.
- Titan.

783
00:50:17.411 --> 00:50:19.902
Your very own heroic guardian
of pure awesome.

784
00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.275
What's your name? Just kidding.
I know everything about you.

785
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:25.081
And I...
And I brought some flowers.

786
00:50:25.252 --> 00:50:28.744
Didn't know what you liked, so I
just grabbed, you know, all of them.

787
00:50:30.557 --> 00:50:32.957
OK. You don't like flowers?
OK, forget the flowers.

788
00:50:33.126 --> 00:50:34.218
What do you want?

789
00:50:34.394 --> 00:50:36.726
Thought maybe we could go
for a little flight around town.

790
00:50:36.897 --> 00:50:38.387
Get to know each other first.

791
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.994
This must be
very thrilling for you.

792
00:50:41.168 --> 00:50:42.499
What do you think you're doing?!

793
00:50:42.669 --> 00:50:44.933
Oh, am I moving too fast?
You're probably right.

794
00:50:45.105 --> 00:50:47.835
I should just rescue you a few times
before we get all romantic.

795
00:50:49.776 --> 00:50:50.834
Saved ya.

796
00:50:51.011 --> 00:50:52.876
You are lucky to have
such a great hero here.

797
00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.913
- Don't you ever...
- Oh, no! Somebody do something!

798
00:50:56.049 --> 00:50:59.018
Oh, right, right, duh.
I gotcha. I gotcha.

799
00:51:04.458 --> 00:51:06.426
That was a close one.
You almost died,

800
00:51:06.593 --> 00:51:08.254
- but I saved you.
- Building!

801
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.329
Gotcha! I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

802
00:51:17.504 --> 00:51:19.369
I couldn't hear you over the sound
of me saving your life.

803
00:51:19.539 --> 00:51:21.097
Put me down! Right now!

804
00:51:21.241 --> 00:51:23.732
OK, all right. All right, hold on.

805
00:51:26.546 --> 00:51:27.808
Are you crazy?

806
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:31.144
I suppose I'm a,
I'm a little crazy, about you.

807
00:51:31.318 --> 00:51:33.582
Who are you, really?

808
00:51:33.787 --> 00:51:38.190
Oh, right. Well, prepare to have
your mind blown, little lady.

809
00:51:39.359 --> 00:51:41.850
- Ta-da.
- Hal?

810
00:51:42.028 --> 00:51:45.828
Yeah. Isn't this great?
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.

811
00:51:45.999 --> 00:51:49.298
- No. It's not great.
- Wow. Our first fight.

812
00:51:49.636 --> 00:51:52.161
This is so us.
We're like an old married couple.

813
00:51:52.339 --> 00:51:55.308
Look, there is no "us, " OK?
There will never be an "us."

814
00:51:55.809 --> 00:51:58.300
But... I have powers.

815
00:51:58.712 --> 00:52:00.339
I have a cape. I'm the good guy.

816
00:52:00.514 --> 00:52:02.982
You are a good guy, Hal,
but you don't understand.

817
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:05.015
- We need to find out why...
- No, no. This...

818
00:52:05.185 --> 00:52:06.777
- Hal, just take a deep breath.
- This isn't right!

819
00:52:06.953 --> 00:52:08.716
- And listen to me for a moment.
- You're supposed to be with me!

820
00:52:08.889 --> 00:52:11.187
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.

821
00:52:11.358 --> 00:52:14.850
It's Titan!
It's Titan, not Hal!

822
00:52:37.918 --> 00:52:39.351
- Bernard.
- Roxanne.

823
00:52:39.519 --> 00:52:43.819
- Sorry I'm late.
- Wow, your hair looks exciting.

824
00:52:44.524 --> 00:52:46.890
Not the only exciting development
of the night.

825
00:52:47.494 --> 00:52:50.622
Megamind's created a new hero,
and I know why.

826
00:52:52.265 --> 00:52:55.166
It all makes sense now.
He missed getting his butt kicked,

827
00:52:55.368 --> 00:52:56.630
so he created a new hero

828
00:52:56.803 --> 00:52:58.464
- to kick it for him.
- Yeah.

829
00:52:58.638 --> 00:53:01.038
But why would he pick Hal?

830
00:53:01.208 --> 00:53:03.540
Hal is the worst possible person
you could pick.

831
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:06.042
Wow. That's a lot to take in.

832
00:53:06.213 --> 00:53:08.010
It boggles my mind.

833
00:53:08.215 --> 00:53:11.378
I am extremely boggled.
You know, I'm sure we'll get

834
00:53:11.518 --> 00:53:13.315
to the bottom
of who's kicking whose butt.

835
00:53:13.487 --> 00:53:18.117
But in the meantime,
let's enjoy each other's company.

836
00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:20.953
I'm sorry, Bernard,
of course, you're right.

837
00:53:21.127 --> 00:53:22.788
You know, I could use a breather.

838
00:53:24.064 --> 00:53:25.258
To Bernard,

839
00:53:25.432 --> 00:53:29.732
for being the only normal thing
in my crazy, upside-down world.

840
00:53:30.337 --> 00:53:33.170
To... being normal.

841
00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:45.315
- Roxanne?
- Yes?

842
00:53:47.053 --> 00:53:49.180
Say I wasn't so normal.

843
00:53:49.356 --> 00:53:52.985
Let's say I was bald
and had the complexion of,

844
00:53:53.159 --> 00:53:58.096
of a popular primary color,
as a random, nonspecific example.

845
00:53:59.132 --> 00:54:01.896
- Would you still enjoy my company?
- Of course!

846
00:54:02.102 --> 00:54:05.970
You don't judge a book by its cover
or a person from the outside.

847
00:54:06.139 --> 00:54:07.333
That's a relief to hear.

848
00:54:07.507 --> 00:54:09.372
You judge them based on their actions.

849
00:54:10.577 --> 00:54:13.171
Well, that seems kind of petty,
don't you think?

850
00:54:42.375 --> 00:54:43.933
What? What?

851
00:54:45.812 --> 00:54:48.872
Don't look at me!
Just a technical glitch!

852
00:54:49.049 --> 00:54:51.313
Don't look yet!
Well, never mind that.

853
00:54:52.819 --> 00:54:53.843
OK.

854
00:54:55.388 --> 00:54:56.514
Where were we?

855
00:54:58.992 --> 00:55:00.721
- You...
- Now, now, hold on.

856
00:55:00.894 --> 00:55:02.361
You!

857
00:55:23.416 --> 00:55:25.111
I can explain!

858
00:55:26.486 --> 00:55:28.454
What about everything you just said?

859
00:55:28.622 --> 00:55:30.647
About judging a book by its cover?

860
00:55:30.857 --> 00:55:33.724
Well, let's take a look
at the contents then, shall we?

861
00:55:33.893 --> 00:55:37.021
You destroyed Metro Man,
you took over the city,

862
00:55:37.197 --> 00:55:40.963
and then, you actually got me
to care about you!

863
00:55:41.735 --> 00:55:45.796
Why are you so evil?
Tricking me?

864
00:55:46.506 --> 00:55:48.974
What could you possibly hope to gain?

865
00:55:54.214 --> 00:55:58.082
Wait a minute.
I don't believe this.

866
00:56:01.788 --> 00:56:04.985
Do you really think
that I would ever be with you?

867
00:56:07.761 --> 00:56:09.058
No.

868
00:56:41.461 --> 00:56:44.692
OK, Minion! You were right!

869
00:56:44.864 --> 00:56:47.799
I was... less right!

870
00:56:47.967 --> 00:56:51.698
We should stick
to what we're good at... being bad.

871
00:56:53.006 --> 00:56:54.906
Minion?

872
00:57:13.059 --> 00:57:14.185
You there!

873
00:57:15.528 --> 00:57:17.189
Yeah, you.

874
00:57:17.831 --> 00:57:20.231
Bring out the Black Mamba.

875
00:57:52.732 --> 00:57:56.930
OK, Titan.
It's time to go down in style.

876
00:58:19.859 --> 00:58:24.626
I hear there's a new hero
who dares challenge my evil.

877
00:58:24.798 --> 00:58:27.460
Where is the one they call Titan?

878
00:58:31.237 --> 00:58:34.297
Challenge me if you dare!

879
00:58:56.963 --> 00:58:58.658
Oh no. We're gonna crash!

880
00:59:02.135 --> 00:59:04.194
This is embarrassing.

881
00:59:10.844 --> 00:59:14.041
Of all the inconsiderate,
bone-headed...

882
00:59:15.315 --> 00:59:18.148
...irresponsible, rude...

883
00:59:18.318 --> 00:59:20.809
Unprofessional, that's what this is!

884
00:59:21.921 --> 00:59:24.219
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?

885
00:59:24.424 --> 00:59:26.392
Of course not! He was a pro!

886
00:59:26.593 --> 00:59:29.494
Hey, Megamind!
You're actually the guy I want to see.

887
00:59:29.662 --> 00:59:31.027
Also, there's a door here.

888
00:59:31.197 --> 00:59:34.963
Do you have any idea
how long I waited for you?

889
00:59:35.134 --> 00:59:36.499
No, no, no, I totally understand
what you're saying.

890
00:59:36.669 --> 00:59:38.967
Could you just, just shut up for one
second. I'm trying to beat this level.

891
00:59:39.138 --> 00:59:41.504
Were you even planning
on showing up?

892
00:59:42.375 --> 00:59:43.808
What's this?

893
00:59:45.678 --> 00:59:47.771
Where did you get all this stuff?

894
00:59:47.914 --> 00:59:49.541
It doesn't belong to me.

895
00:59:49.716 --> 00:59:51.616
- You stole it?
- Pretty cool, right?

896
00:59:51.784 --> 00:59:55.151
- No, no, no, no! You're a hero!
- Being a hero is for losers!

897
00:59:55.321 --> 00:59:58.188
It's work, work, work,
24/7, and for what?

898
00:59:58.825 --> 01:00:00.486
I only took the gig to get the girl,

899
01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.992
and it turns out Roxanne
doesn't want anything to do with me.

900
01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:05.891
- Roxanne Ritchi?
- Yeah! Roxanne Ritchi!

901
01:00:06.065 --> 01:00:08.431
I saw her having dinner
and making googly eyes

902
01:00:08.635 --> 01:00:10.535
at some intellectual dweeb!

903
01:00:11.337 --> 01:00:12.929
Who needs all that noise?

904
01:00:13.106 --> 01:00:16.007
That's why I think we should team up.

905
01:00:16.175 --> 01:00:17.972
You... Wait... What?

906
01:00:18.111 --> 01:00:20.238
With my power,
and your big-headedness,

907
01:00:20.413 --> 01:00:23.473
- we could rule the city!
- You want to team up?

908
01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:25.277
I even drew up
some new costume designs, see?

909
01:00:25.485 --> 01:00:26.747
- Costume designs?
- You'd be the brains,

910
01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.251
so you'd get a little brain,

911
01:00:28.421 --> 01:00:29.888
wearing glasses on your costume,
or something.

912
01:00:30.056 --> 01:00:32.047
And since I'm the cool one,
I'd have, like,

913
01:00:32.325 --> 01:00:34.623
two tanks swordfighting...

914
01:00:35.128 --> 01:00:36.993
I can't believe you.

915
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:39.792
All your gifts, all your powers,

916
01:00:39.999 --> 01:00:43.560
and you... you squander them
for your own personal gain.

917
01:00:43.937 --> 01:00:46.667
- Yes!
- No! I'm the villain!

918
01:00:46.839 --> 01:00:48.864
You're the good guy!
I do something bad,

919
01:00:49.042 --> 01:00:52.534
and you come and get me!
That's why I created you.

920
01:00:52.712 --> 01:00:56.546
Yeah, right. You're nuts.
Space Dad told me...

921
01:00:56.716 --> 01:00:58.946
Look, I'm your space dad!

922
01:01:00.086 --> 01:01:02.554
You should be more like Metro Man.

923
01:01:03.923 --> 01:01:06.483
- You tricked me?
- Oh, don't like that?

924
01:01:06.693 --> 01:01:07.853
Well, there's more.

925
01:01:09.696 --> 01:01:13.359
I'm also the intellectual dweeb
dating Roxanne.

926
01:01:13.533 --> 01:01:17.264
- No.
- And we were smooching up a storm!

927
01:01:20.073 --> 01:01:21.563
When I get my hands on you,
I'm gonna...

928
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:24.403
Yes! Yes, I know!
Bring me to justice.

929
01:01:24.577 --> 01:01:27.011
Oh God, how I've missed this.

930
01:01:30.583 --> 01:01:32.983
And the hero strikes the first blow.

931
01:01:33.152 --> 01:01:35.450
But evil returns with a backhand!

932
01:01:39.692 --> 01:01:41.057
Yes!

933
01:01:50.103 --> 01:01:51.502
Come out, you little freak!

934
01:01:52.038 --> 01:01:55.064
I want to see what that big brain
looks like on the pavement!

935
01:02:01.781 --> 01:02:04.648
You fell for the oldest
evil trick in the book!

936
01:02:05.585 --> 01:02:07.052
You little blue twerp!

937
01:02:09.655 --> 01:02:11.179
En garde!

938
01:02:16.295 --> 01:02:18.195
Oh, now that's the spirit!

939
01:02:18.364 --> 01:02:20.855
Parry! Thrust! Parry again!

940
01:02:21.034 --> 01:02:24.265
Now it's time for some witty
back and forth banter!

941
01:02:24.404 --> 01:02:26.269
You go first!

942
01:02:26.406 --> 01:02:28.874
OK! Look, I'm not sure
where to go with that!

943
01:02:30.576 --> 01:02:32.635
This one's for stealing
my girlfriend!

944
01:02:38.251 --> 01:02:40.913
This one's for Space Dad making
a fool out of me!

945
01:02:48.795 --> 01:02:53.027
And, Megamind, this one's
for Space Stepmom! You lied to her!

946
01:02:53.766 --> 01:02:57.532
Well done. I thought
that battle went really, really well.

947
01:02:57.703 --> 01:02:59.694
- I mean, I have a few notes.
- Notes?

948
01:02:59.872 --> 01:03:01.931
But they can wait.
You can take me to jail now.

949
01:03:02.175 --> 01:03:05.872
Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking
more like the morgue. You're dead!

950
01:03:06.045 --> 01:03:08.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This isn't how you play the game.

951
01:03:08.714 --> 01:03:10.375
Game over.

952
01:03:16.489 --> 01:03:17.478
Brain-bots!

953
01:03:23.563 --> 01:03:24.723
I'm calling time out!

954
01:03:25.731 --> 01:03:28.564
Time out? Time out! Time out!

955
01:03:38.678 --> 01:03:41.078
Brain-bots,
initiate the fail-safe.

956
01:03:48.588 --> 01:03:52.581
Guess what, Buster Brown?
It's made from copper.

957
01:03:52.758 --> 01:03:54.385
You're powerless against it.

958
01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.894
It's the very same metal used
to defeat... Metro Man?

959
01:03:59.332 --> 01:04:02.597
You should stop comparing me
to Metro Man!

960
01:04:12.145 --> 01:04:14.705
You can run, Megamind,
but you can't hide!

961
01:04:14.847 --> 01:04:16.906
We're saved! We're saved!

962
01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:18.550
What's your name, new hero?

963
01:04:18.718 --> 01:04:20.913
- It's Titan.
- Thank you!

964
01:04:21.087 --> 01:04:23.647
Thank you! Titan has freed us!

965
01:04:23.823 --> 01:04:28.317
Oh, I wouldn't say "free."
More like under new management.

966
01:04:32.999 --> 01:04:36.230
- What do you want?
- Titan's turned evil.

967
01:04:36.369 --> 01:04:39.361
Congratulations. Another one of your
genius plans has backfired on you.

968
01:04:39.539 --> 01:04:41.734
And why did my doorman let you up?

969
01:04:42.975 --> 01:04:44.340
Carlos.

970
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:47.502
Please, Roxanne, no. No.
I need your help.

971
01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.341
Why do you need my help?

972
01:04:51.417 --> 01:04:53.885
Because you're
the smartest person I know.

973
01:04:55.588 --> 01:04:56.748
But you can't hide here.

974
01:04:56.889 --> 01:04:59.084
The copper should have worked.
Why didn't the copper work?

975
01:04:59.258 --> 01:05:00.748
The copper worked
perfectly well last time.

976
01:05:00.927 --> 01:05:02.758
Copper? You're not making any sense.

977
01:05:02.929 --> 01:05:04.692
Look, if we don't find
Titan's weakness,

978
01:05:04.864 --> 01:05:06.422
he'll destroy the whole city.

979
01:05:09.168 --> 01:05:11.932
- OK, how can I help?
- We need to find answers.

980
01:05:12.238 --> 01:05:15.765
You knew Metro Man best.
Did he have a hideout? A cave?

981
01:05:15.908 --> 01:05:20.641
A solitary fortress of some kind?
Anything that would give us clues.

982
01:05:20.813 --> 01:05:23.441
Well... there is one place I know.

983
01:05:25.952 --> 01:05:28.682
You gave him these powers.
Can't you just take them away?

984
01:05:28.854 --> 01:05:33.416
I can't. I lost my diffuser gun
when I misplaced the invisible car.

985
01:05:34.026 --> 01:05:38.429
The night you dumped me. Alone.
In the rain.

986
01:05:39.799 --> 01:05:41.027
Did you ever look back?

987
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.363
- No!
- My giant blue head!

988
01:05:44.537 --> 01:05:45.663
I guess we're here.

989
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:51.371
So, this is where he hid it.

990
01:05:51.544 --> 01:05:55.913
After all these years.
My old shoolhouse.

991
01:05:58.317 --> 01:06:01.480
You know, I think there's an apology
in order for the other night.

992
01:06:01.621 --> 01:06:03.680
OK, that would be nice,
but make it quick.

993
01:06:03.856 --> 01:06:05.824
We have much more
pressing matters to deal with.

994
01:06:09.929 --> 01:06:14.389
Wow. I can't believe
he kept all this stuff.

995
01:06:15.901 --> 01:06:17.198
I remember when he wore that.

996
01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:20.862
- Shouldn't we try to stay focused here?
- Yes, of course. Right. Focused.

997
01:06:22.341 --> 01:06:24.036
Hey. Come over and look at this.

998
01:06:24.543 --> 01:06:26.306
What is it? What did you find?

999
01:06:29.415 --> 01:06:30.404
Look.

1000
01:06:31.217 --> 01:06:33.412
This glass has ice cubes in it.

1001
01:06:33.586 --> 01:06:35.918
Yes, that's what happens
when water gets cold.

1002
01:06:36.088 --> 01:06:39.251
No, what I'm saying is,
don't you think it's a little odd

1003
01:06:39.425 --> 01:06:41.620
that the ice hasn't melted yet?

1004
01:06:41.794 --> 01:06:43.455
One of life's great mysteries.

1005
01:06:50.336 --> 01:06:51.325
Hey.

1006
01:07:03.416 --> 01:07:04.906
<i>We now have confirmed reports.</i>

1007
01:07:05.084 --> 01:07:08.815
<i>Titan, first thought to be</i>
<i>this city's new hero, has turned evil.</i>

1008
01:07:08.988 --> 01:07:11.855
<i>The city has never seen</i>
<i>this level of destruction.</i>

1009
01:07:12.091 --> 01:07:13.956
<i>If only Metro Man were still alive.</i>

1010
01:07:14.126 --> 01:07:15.957
- You're alive?
- You're alive.

1011
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:18.894
- I'm alive.
- But I, we...

1012
01:07:19.031 --> 01:07:21.192
We saw your skeleton!
You were dead!

1013
01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.334
Are you a ghost?

1014
01:07:23.502 --> 01:07:26.801
There had better be
an amazing explanation for this.

1015
01:07:26.972 --> 01:07:28.940
Speak, apparition.

1016
01:07:39.185 --> 01:07:41.710
OK. OK, OK, OK.

1017
01:07:41.921 --> 01:07:43.582
You both deserve the truth.

1018
01:07:43.723 --> 01:07:45.987
It all started
back at the observatory.

1019
01:07:46.992 --> 01:07:49.392
<i>Roxanne was kidnapped.</i>
<i>I was gonna stop you.</i>

1020
01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:52.763
<i>My head wasn't in the game that day.</i>

1021
01:07:53.265 --> 01:07:55.062
<i>We were kind</i>
<i>of going through the motions.</i>

1022
01:07:55.634 --> 01:07:59.229
<i>So... using my super-speed,</i>

1023
01:07:59.438 --> 01:08:00.598
<i>I decided to go clear my head.</i>

1024
01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.105
<i>Fire!</i>

1025
01:08:03.175 --> 01:08:04.437
<i>Then I realized,</i>

1026
01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:08.546
<i>we had done this same silly charade</i>
<i>our entire lives.</i>

1027
01:08:09.382 --> 01:08:12.180
<i>I tried to get my mind off</i>
<i>how I was feeling,</i>

1028
01:08:12.351 --> 01:08:14.285
<i>but I just felt stuck.</i>

1029
01:08:15.454 --> 01:08:19.322
<i>I began to realize,</i>
<i>despite all my powers,</i>

1030
01:08:19.492 --> 01:08:23.952
<i>each and every citizen of Metro</i>
<i>had something I didn't: a choice.</i>

1031
01:08:25.331 --> 01:08:29.062
<i>Ever since I can remember, I've always</i>
<i>had to be what the city wanted me to be.</i>

1032
01:08:30.302 --> 01:08:32.429
<i>But what about what I wanted to do?</i>

1033
01:08:33.472 --> 01:08:35.167
<i>Then it suddenly hit me.</i>

1034
01:08:36.242 --> 01:08:38.039
<i>I do have a choice.</i>

1035
01:08:39.278 --> 01:08:41.405
<i>I can be whatever I want to be.</i>

1036
01:08:41.747 --> 01:08:43.977
<i>No one said this hero thing had to be</i>
<i>a lifetime gig.</i>

1037
01:08:45.017 --> 01:08:46.211
<i>You can't just quit, either.</i>

1038
01:08:47.553 --> 01:08:52.217
<i>That's when I got the brilliant idea...</i>
<i>to fake my death.</i>

1039
01:08:52.591 --> 01:08:55.583
Copper drains my powers.

1040
01:08:55.761 --> 01:08:57.695
<i>Your weakness is copper?.</i>

1041
01:08:58.497 --> 01:09:02.661
<i>Once your death ray hit,</i>
<i>I'd never felt so alive.</i>

1042
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:05.933
<i>So I borrowed a prop</i>
<i>from a nearby nursing school.</i>

1043
01:09:06.605 --> 01:09:09.438
<i>Metro Man was finally dead.</i>

1044
01:09:09.608 --> 01:09:10.768
And Music Man was born!

1045
01:09:10.943 --> 01:09:13.207
- Music Man?
- That way I could keep my logo.

1046
01:09:13.379 --> 01:09:14.437
- 'Cause of wha...?
- Come again?

1047
01:09:14.613 --> 01:09:18.140
I was finally free to get in touch
with my true power...

1048
01:09:18.918 --> 01:09:20.681
...weaving lyrical magic.

1049
01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:22.082
Check this out.

1050
01:09:22.254 --> 01:09:25.314
<i>I have eyes that can see.</i>

1051
01:09:25.524 --> 01:09:29.426
<i>Right through lead...</i>

1052
01:09:29.595 --> 01:09:31.586
- You're horrible!
- Granted, you have talent.

1053
01:09:31.764 --> 01:09:35.461
But there's a madman
out there destroying our... your city.

1054
01:09:36.168 --> 01:09:37.658
How could you do this?!

1055
01:09:38.971 --> 01:09:41.804
The people of this city relied on you,
and you deserted them!

1056
01:09:42.575 --> 01:09:44.736
You left us in the hands of him!

1057
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:47.276
- No offense.
- No, I'm with you.

1058
01:09:47.446 --> 01:09:49.414
Look, we need your help.

1059
01:09:49.582 --> 01:09:52.210
I'm sorry. I really am.

1060
01:09:53.252 --> 01:09:54.879
I'm done.

1061
01:09:55.054 --> 01:09:58.546
You know, little buddy,
there's a yin for every yang.

1062
01:09:58.691 --> 01:10:01.819
If there's bad,
good will rise up against it.

1063
01:10:02.828 --> 01:10:05.296
It's taken me a long time
to find my calling.

1064
01:10:06.499 --> 01:10:08.967
Now it's about time you find yours.

1065
01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.073
Hey, who needs him?

1066
01:10:16.408 --> 01:10:17.932
We can beat Titan ourselves.

1067
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:21.079
I say we go back to the evil lair,
grab some ray guns,

1068
01:10:21.247 --> 01:10:23.841
hold him sideways,
and just go all gangsta on him.

1069
01:10:24.583 --> 01:10:26.050
We can't.

1070
01:10:26.252 --> 01:10:28.015
So that's it? You're just giving up?

1071
01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:33.221
I'm the bad guy. I don't save the day,
I don't fly off into the sunset,

1072
01:10:33.425 --> 01:10:35.985
and I don't get the girl.

1073
01:10:36.362 --> 01:10:38.023
I'm going home.

1074
01:11:07.593 --> 01:11:11.461
<i>Unless someone comes</i>
<i>to our aid soon, all may be lost.</i>

1075
01:11:12.765 --> 01:11:15.962
<i>Thousands have already fled the city</i>
<i>in a mass exodus.</i>

1076
01:11:16.135 --> 01:11:20.071
<i>Remaining citizens are warned</i>
<i>to stay indoors until further notice.</i>

1077
01:11:21.807 --> 01:11:23.297
<i>Authorities have issued a warning</i>

1078
01:11:23.442 --> 01:11:26.809
<i>to stay out of the downtown area</i>
<i>at all costs.</i>

1079
01:11:38.857 --> 01:11:40.347
Hal!

1080
01:11:41.393 --> 01:11:42.724
Hal!

1081
01:11:44.196 --> 01:11:46.687
Let me guess.
After seeing how awesome I am,

1082
01:11:46.865 --> 01:11:50.198
you've finally come to your senses?
Well, I'm over you.

1083
01:11:50.369 --> 01:11:53.566
- I've come to stop you, Hal.
- You? Oh, wow.

1084
01:11:53.739 --> 01:11:55.730
OK, what are you gonna do,
report me to death?

1085
01:11:55.908 --> 01:11:57.933
I was going to try reasoning with you.

1086
01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:02.206
You and I, we worked together
for a long time. I know you.

1087
01:12:02.381 --> 01:12:05.908
You don't know me.
You never took the time to know me.

1088
01:12:06.085 --> 01:12:08.417
This is the first time
we've hung out socially,

1089
01:12:08.587 --> 01:12:10.418
and it's when
I'm about to destroy the city!

1090
01:12:10.589 --> 01:12:12.318
I want to talk to the real Hal.

1091
01:12:12.524 --> 01:12:14.754
I want to talk to the guy
who loved being a cameraman,

1092
01:12:14.927 --> 01:12:17.327
and eating dip, and being a nerd,

1093
01:12:17.529 --> 01:12:19.588
and being not as scary
as the Tighten Hal.

1094
01:12:19.765 --> 01:12:20.925
Too late!

1095
01:12:23.002 --> 01:12:24.128
<i>...Interrupting our scheduled...</i>

1096
01:12:24.303 --> 01:12:26.100
<i>...extraordinary events</i>
<i>taking place...</i>

1097
01:12:26.805 --> 01:12:28.033
<i>Heat in the valley and...</i>

1098
01:12:28.173 --> 01:12:29.367
<i>Megamind!</i>

1099
01:12:31.543 --> 01:12:34.307
<i>You and I have</i>
<i>some unfinished business.</i>

1100
01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.038
<i>I'll be waiting at Metro Tower.</i>

1101
01:12:36.215 --> 01:12:38.649
<i>Oh, and just</i>
<i>so you don't get cold feet...</i>

1102
01:12:40.486 --> 01:12:41.714
Roxanne.

1103
01:12:41.887 --> 01:12:45.516
<i>Come on, Roxie, call for your hero</i>
<i>to come rescue you.</i>

1104
01:12:46.992 --> 01:12:51.395
<i>Megamind, I don't even know</i>
<i>if you're listening, but if you are,</i>

1105
01:12:52.197 --> 01:12:53.824
<i>you can't give up.</i>

1106
01:12:55.801 --> 01:12:59.328
<i>The Megamind I knew</i>
<i>would never have run from a fight,</i>

1107
01:12:59.505 --> 01:13:03.032
<i>even when he knew he had</i>
<i>absolutely no chance of winning.</i>

1108
01:13:03.242 --> 01:13:05.676
<i>It was your best quality.</i>

1109
01:13:05.844 --> 01:13:08.938
<i>You need to be that guy right now.</i>

1110
01:13:10.849 --> 01:13:12.282
<i>The city needs you.</i>

1111
01:13:14.887 --> 01:13:16.479
<i>I need you.</i>

1112
01:13:16.655 --> 01:13:17.747
Roxanne.

1113
01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:19.255
<i>You have one hour.</i>

1114
01:13:19.792 --> 01:13:21.760
<i>Don't keep me waiting.</i>

1115
01:13:23.562 --> 01:13:27.589
Warden! Warden! Listen to me!
You have to let me go!

1116
01:13:27.733 --> 01:13:29.724
Tighten has to be stopped!

1117
01:13:29.935 --> 01:13:33.336
Sorry, Megamind.
You still have 88 life sentences to go.

1118
01:13:33.839 --> 01:13:35.670
Plenty of time to reflect
on what you've done.

1119
01:13:35.841 --> 01:13:39.675
Did you want to hear me say it?
I'll say it.

1120
01:13:40.045 --> 01:13:43.344
Here it is,
from the blackest part of my heart.

1121
01:13:45.684 --> 01:13:49.051
I am sorry!

1122
01:13:52.024 --> 01:13:53.389
Not buying it.

1123
01:13:55.794 --> 01:13:57.489
I don't blame you.

1124
01:13:58.564 --> 01:14:00.828
I've terrorized this city
countless times.

1125
01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.563
Created a hero
who's turned out to be a villain.

1126
01:14:05.504 --> 01:14:08.166
I lied to Roxanne, and...

1127
01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:13.141
...my best friend Minion,
I treated like dirt.

1128
01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:17.644
Please don't make this city...

1129
01:14:19.118 --> 01:14:22.178
...don't make Roxanne
pay for my wrongdoings.

1130
01:14:26.492 --> 01:14:27.982
Apology accepted.

1131
01:14:30.996 --> 01:14:34.864
Oh, Minion, you fantastic fish, you.

1132
01:14:35.033 --> 01:14:37.968
What are we waiting for?
We'd better get going.

1133
01:14:40.839 --> 01:14:42.329
You got me.

1134
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:47.274
- Good luck, fellas!
- We're gonna die!

1135
01:14:48.747 --> 01:14:49.805
Wait, what?

1136
01:14:50.549 --> 01:14:54.110
<i>Hey, Metro losers.</i>
<i>This is Metro Tower.</i>

1137
01:14:54.286 --> 01:14:57.414
<i>They say it's supposed to be</i>
<i>a symbol of our city's strength.</i>

1138
01:14:57.589 --> 01:14:59.648
But for me,
it's a reminder of the day

1139
01:14:59.858 --> 01:15:05.228
this woman ferociously ripped
out my heart. And I hate reminders!

1140
01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:19.802
Help!

1141
01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:25.641
Please don't do this. I know
there's still good in you, Hal.

1142
01:15:25.818 --> 01:15:27.308
You're so naive, Roxie.

1143
01:15:27.486 --> 01:15:30.455
You see the good in everybody,
even when it's not there.

1144
01:15:30.656 --> 01:15:32.715
You're living a fantasy.

1145
01:15:32.858 --> 01:15:36.123
There is no Easter Bunny,
there is no Tooth Fairy,

1146
01:15:36.295 --> 01:15:38.126
and there is no Queen of England.

1147
01:15:39.031 --> 01:15:42.296
This is the real world,
and you need to wake up!

1148
01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:57.273
<i>You dare challenge Megamind?</i>

1149
01:15:57.449 --> 01:16:00.509
This town isn't big enough
for two super-villains!

1150
01:16:00.686 --> 01:16:05.316
<i>Oh, you're a villain all right!</i>
<i>Just not a super one!</i>

1151
01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:07.390
Yeah? What's the difference?

1152
01:16:11.597 --> 01:16:12.825
Presentation!

1153
01:16:32.818 --> 01:16:35.912
- I knew you'd come back.
- Well, that made one of us.

1154
01:17:02.714 --> 01:17:07.151
- What's the plan?
- Well, it mostly involves not dying.

1155
01:17:07.319 --> 01:17:08.581
I like that plan.

1156
01:17:26.204 --> 01:17:27.933
Building!

1157
01:17:29.374 --> 01:17:31.433
Go faster!
Make this thing go faster!

1158
01:17:33.011 --> 01:17:34.308
I can't control it!

1159
01:17:49.828 --> 01:17:50.988
No.

1160
01:17:53.966 --> 01:17:55.456
Well, that was easy.

1161
01:17:55.634 --> 01:17:57.932
Looks like there's
only one loose end now.

1162
01:18:08.714 --> 01:18:12.343
Please, let's have a little respect
for public transportation.

1163
01:18:12.951 --> 01:18:14.475
You came back!

1164
01:18:14.653 --> 01:18:17.781
You were right, Roxanne.
I never should have left.

1165
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:20.251
I... I thought you were dead.

1166
01:18:20.425 --> 01:18:23.656
My death was... greatly exaggerated.

1167
01:18:23.829 --> 01:18:26.593
So, you're the punk I've heard about.

1168
01:18:40.145 --> 01:18:43.581
I'm sorry.
I did the best I could.

1169
01:18:45.384 --> 01:18:47.079
I'm so proud of you.

1170
01:18:50.856 --> 01:18:52.346
Minion?

1171
01:18:53.158 --> 01:18:55.023
Surprise!

1172
01:18:56.261 --> 01:18:58.092
He's the real hero.

1173
01:19:04.903 --> 01:19:06.302
Megamind.

1174
01:19:08.006 --> 01:19:09.598
Going somewhere?

1175
01:19:10.042 --> 01:19:11.634
Besides jail?

1176
01:19:19.217 --> 01:19:20.650
No, not in the face, man. Please.

1177
01:19:20.819 --> 01:19:24.255
If you know what's good for you,
Tighten, you'll stay out of Metrocity!

1178
01:19:24.423 --> 01:19:25.856
- You got it!
- For good!

1179
01:20:00.992 --> 01:20:02.983
Pretty sneaky, sis.

1180
01:20:03.161 --> 01:20:06.289
But there's only one person I know
who calls this town "Metrocity."

1181
01:20:08.166 --> 01:20:09.463
You.

1182
01:20:12.904 --> 01:20:14.895
Bet you think it's really funny?

1183
01:20:16.174 --> 01:20:18.369
Let's all laugh
at the really cool guy?

1184
01:20:21.947 --> 01:20:23.346
Well, you're not gonna be laughing
for long.

1185
01:20:24.049 --> 01:20:25.516
The invisible car.

1186
01:20:25.684 --> 01:20:27.675
Hey! Remember that night
that I dumped you?

1187
01:20:29.387 --> 01:20:31.218
You're bringing this up now?

1188
01:20:31.389 --> 01:20:32.583
Well, I did look back!

1189
01:20:34.326 --> 01:20:36.920
You did? You did?

1190
01:20:37.095 --> 01:20:40.587
Yes! And you should look back
right now!

1191
01:20:41.933 --> 01:20:43.491
Oh, I get it!

1192
01:20:51.409 --> 01:20:53.934
This is the last time
you make a fool out of me!

1193
01:20:54.613 --> 01:20:56.376
I made you a hero.

1194
01:20:56.548 --> 01:21:00.609
You did the fool thing
all by yourself.

1195
01:21:06.992 --> 01:21:08.391
You're so pathetic.

1196
01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:12.155
No matter what side you're on,
you're always the loser.

1197
01:21:12.731 --> 01:21:14.460
There's a benefit to losing.

1198
01:21:14.633 --> 01:21:16.897
You get to learn from your mistakes.

1199
01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:23.805
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

1200
01:21:23.975 --> 01:21:26.239
Minion, if I live, I will kill you.

1201
01:21:36.855 --> 01:21:38.516
Enjoy your flight!

1202
01:21:40.692 --> 01:21:42.182
Megamind!

1203
01:21:49.768 --> 01:21:52.032
<i>So this is how it ends.</i>

1204
01:21:53.205 --> 01:21:56.333
<i>Normally, I'd chalk this up</i>
<i>to my last glorious failure.</i>

1205
01:21:58.109 --> 01:21:59.406
<i>But not today.</i>

1206
01:22:00.545 --> 01:22:03.514
<i>What can I say?</i>
<i>Old habits die hard.</i>

1207
01:22:10.555 --> 01:22:12.147
Say bye-bye, Roxie.

1208
01:22:17.529 --> 01:22:18.860
Ollo.

1209
01:22:27.539 --> 01:22:31.202
The thing about bad guys,
they always lose!

1210
01:22:35.447 --> 01:22:38.245
- You did it. You won.
- Well...

1211
01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:42.843
I finally had a reason to win. You.

1212
01:22:51.863 --> 01:22:53.091
Minion!

1213
01:22:53.498 --> 01:22:57.366
Can't see. It's cold and... warm,
and dark and light.

1214
01:22:57.535 --> 01:22:59.560
It's me, Minion. I'm right here.

1215
01:22:59.738 --> 01:23:02.798
We've had a lot of adventures together,
you and I.

1216
01:23:02.974 --> 01:23:04.566
We have, Minion.

1217
01:23:06.845 --> 01:23:11.373
I mean... most of them
ended in horrible failure,

1218
01:23:11.549 --> 01:23:16.077
but we won today. Didn't we, sir?

1219
01:23:16.254 --> 01:23:19.917
Yes, Minion, we did it.
Thanks to you.

1220
01:23:20.091 --> 01:23:24.357
Code: We're The Good Guys Now.

1221
01:23:24.496 --> 01:23:27.294
Code: I Guess We Are.

1222
01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.535
Oh, oh, oh, I'm going!
I think this, this is it!

1223
01:23:31.670 --> 01:23:34.662
I'm going... going far...

1224
01:23:44.916 --> 01:23:46.543
What a drama queen.

1225
01:23:47.085 --> 01:23:50.612
You know, I'm feeling much better now.
I guess I just needed a swim.

1226
01:23:50.789 --> 01:23:52.347
He had you, didn't he?

1227
01:23:52.524 --> 01:23:54.617
Classic Minion.
Don't give me that face.

1228
01:23:54.793 --> 01:23:56.351
He reels you in with that little face.

1229
01:23:56.528 --> 01:23:58.359
- Look at that face.
- We did it!

1230
01:23:58.530 --> 01:24:00.157
We did it!

1231
01:24:00.332 --> 01:24:02.061
- Fist pump!
- You did it!

1232
01:24:02.233 --> 01:24:03.791
We won, we won, we won!

1233
01:24:06.404 --> 01:24:07.803
Get back, you savages!

1234
01:24:07.972 --> 01:24:12.136
Sorry! Sorry. He's just not used
to positive feedback.

1235
01:24:15.714 --> 01:24:19.206
<i>Funny, I guess destiny is</i>
<i>not the path given to us...</i>

1236
01:24:22.354 --> 01:24:25.152
<i>...but the path</i>
<i>we choose for ourselves.</i>

1237
01:24:33.231 --> 01:24:35.665
All right, put your hands in the air.

1238
01:24:39.104 --> 01:24:40.401
Now hand over your wallets.

1239
01:24:42.307 --> 01:24:44.332
I'm just kidding!

1240
01:24:44.509 --> 01:24:45.567
Just kidding!

1241
01:24:45.744 --> 01:24:49.976
<i>I have to admit,</i>
<i>being good has its perks.</i>

1242
01:24:51.216 --> 01:24:53.912
You know, you look
pretty good in white.

1243
01:24:54.085 --> 01:24:56.315
Megamind, if you plea...

1244
01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.657
Hey. My kid can't see.

1245
01:25:04.262 --> 01:25:05.695
Sorry, my friend.

1246
01:25:06.431 --> 01:25:09.662
Way to go, little buddy.
I knew he had it in him.

1247
01:25:09.834 --> 01:25:11.802
Ladies and gentlemen,

1248
01:25:11.970 --> 01:25:16.031
Megamind, defender of Metro City!

1249
01:25:17.876 --> 01:25:21.073
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I like the sound of that.</i>

1250
01:25:21.546 --> 01:25:22.535
Hit it!

1251
01:25:32.223 --> 01:25:35.681
Megamind! Megamind!
Megamind! Megamind!

1252
01:25:41.866 --> 01:25:45.597
I'm bad! I'm bad! That's right. Yeah!

1253
01:28:32.170 --> 01:28:35.230
Sir, you really need to empty
your pockets more often.

1254
01:28:35.873 --> 01:28:38.637
This has been the worst day
of my entire life.

1255
01:28:39.344 --> 01:28:40.333
No worries.
