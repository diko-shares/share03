00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,387
What's wrong with you?

2
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,065
You haven't answered my emails.

3
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,317
I can't tell you now.

4
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,029
Yes, you can.

5
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,493
Who is the caveman?

6
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,788
The man Grandfatherwanted me to find.

7
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,125
You can't bring him in like that.

8
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:42,929
Lord Shingen, yourfather is asking foryou.

9
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,933
It is time.

10
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:59,654
I need to speak with my father...

11
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,157
before he speaks to Grandfather.

12
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,326
He'll talk to you later, Mariko.

13
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,994
Father! I need to see you now!

14
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,955
Not now, Mariko!

15
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,240
Don't look so sad, Shingen.

16
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,159
I'm still dying.

17
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:05,172
There is no easy way to say this.

18
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:10,970
But then, it's never been easy for us, has it?

19
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,265
I have tried, father.

20
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,851
You've done the best you can.

21
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,017
That will never happen.

22
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,301
I pledge to you...

23
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,387
MasterYashida...

24
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,556
to be vigilant...

25
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,684
and to dedicate my life...

26
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,852
to protect Mariko.

27
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,910
This cowardly attack was...

28
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,078
the work ofYakuza thugs.

29
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:16,333
A violent response to my efforts...

30
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,711
to crack down on organized crime.

31
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,674
They exited the North Gate.

32
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,761
She was with the stranger...

33
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,477
Kill him already!

34
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:19,224
Our island is long and thin.

35
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,894
Trains only run in two directions.

36
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,896
I assure you Lord Shingen...

37
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:25,939
my officers are making every effort...

38
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,983
Then they're idiots.

39
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:30,110
You've wasted enough of my time.

40
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:33,072
I have my father's affairs to attend to.

41
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,117
Get out and find her!

42
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,902
Lfthe Yakuza got into the funeral...

43
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:13,487
they had someone inside.

44
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,156
They'll neverfind me here.

45
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:18,992
You're not safe.

46
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:21,912
I'm coming down there.

47
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,580
They'll follow you.

48
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:25,082
Please.

49
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,835
Wait a few days.

50
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:29,336
Please. I'm fine.

51
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,255
Logan's here.

52
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,465
He's wounded, Mariko.

53
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,301
Someone's here.

54
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:38,011
I have to go.

55
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,394
A tree fell on the road.

56
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:48,605
The men could use some help.

57
01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:07,638
Did you know I studied biology in college?

58
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,017
Genetics.

59
01:27:15,022 --> 01:27:17,481
There are genes that skip generations.

60
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,817
Recessive genes.

61
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:23,237
Eyes.

62
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:24,488
Eyes. Hair.

63
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,158
Talent.

64
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:29,994
Temperament.

65
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:35,374
Not every child gets the same.

66
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:38,294
My father saw little of himself in me.

67
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,005
But in you...

68
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,799
he faced a mirror.

69
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,862
How did you convince my father...

70
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:06,447
to award you control...

71
01:28:06,657 --> 01:28:08,074
ofAsia's largest corporation?

72
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:10,034
You've gone insane.

73
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,371
I'm just waking up.

74
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:16,666
Lfyou kill me, you will lose...

75
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:18,709
what little honoryou have left.

76
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:23,714
Fear not Mariko.

77
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:26,258
I don't want to hurt you.

78
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:27,843
I want to help you.

79
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,720
Help you end your pain...

80
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:31,180
what that mutant stopped you...

81
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:32,598
from doing last week.

82
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:35,059
I neverwanted to die, Father.

83
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:53,869
It's alright, Mariko.

84
01:28:59,084 --> 01:28:59,792
Come with me.

85
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:00,793
What is happening?!

86
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:03,295
More than you can imagine.

87
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:35,075
Why have you brought me here?

88
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:36,994
What are you hiding?

89
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:38,912
You will soon find out.

90
01:50:51,562 --> 01:50:53,896
I know you care for him.

91
01:50:54,315 --> 01:50:55,857
You need to let go ofthat.

92
01:50:56,108 --> 01:50:58,151
You are a Yashida.

93
01:50:58,402 --> 01:51:00,278
She betrayed my grandfather...

94
01:51:00,779 --> 01:51:02,113
and so have you.

95
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:03,573
No Mariko.

96
01:51:03,907 --> 01:51:05,742
We grew up together.

97
01:51:05,993 --> 01:51:07,368
You need to trust me.

98
01:51:08,579 --> 01:51:10,371
Let me go to him!

99
01:51:10,581 --> 01:51:12,999
He saved my life!

100
01:51:13,208 --> 01:51:15,585
Let him go, Mariko!

101
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:17,045
This isn't easy for me but...

102
01:51:17,338 --> 01:51:20,256
I'm following Grandfather's wishes.

103
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,476
The Viperwoman is evil...

104
01:51:31,685 --> 01:51:33,436
we both know that.

105
01:51:33,645 --> 01:51:36,439
But she's a means to an end...

106
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:39,609
an end your grandfatherwanted.

107
01:52:06,678 --> 01:52:08,304
You need to trust me.

108
01:52:08,889 --> 01:52:10,181
Is that hard?

109
01:52:10,891 --> 01:52:13,518
We were meant to be together.

110
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:16,020
We still can be.

111
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:18,439
Perhaps.

112
01:52:54,351 --> 01:52:55,560
This is madness.

113
01:57:51,314 --> 01:57:52,815
I'm sorry.

114
02:01:26,446 --> 02:01:28,697
You are a monster.

115
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:31,231
You are my only family.

116
02:05:32,775 --> 02:05:35,110
Be well, sister.
