1
00:02:13.093 --> 00:02:17.930
(radio announcer) It is believed that
the indictment is only one of a series

2
00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:22.851
to be handed down as the result of
a special grand jury investigation.

3
00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:26.063
Graverobbing in Texas
is this hour's top news story.

4
00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:30.359
An informant led officers of the Muerto
County Sheriff's Department to a cemetery

5
00:02:30.443 --> 00:02:34.613
just outside the small rural Texas
community of Newt early this morning.

6
00:02:34.697 --> 00:02:38.283
Officers there discovered
what appeared to be a grisly work of art,

7
00:02:38.368 --> 00:02:42.955
the remains of a badly decomposed body
wired to a large monument.

8
00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:47.042
A second body was found in a ditch
near the perimeter of the cemetery.

9
00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:51.171
Subsequent investigation has revealed
at least a dozen empty crypts,

10
00:02:51.256 --> 00:02:54.466
and it's feared more will turn up
as the probe continues.

11
00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:59.263
Deputies report that in some instances,
only parts of a corpse had been removed,

12
00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:02.099
the head or in some cases
the extremities removed,

13
00:03:02.183 --> 00:03:04.643
the remainder of the corpse left intact.

14
00:03:04.727 --> 00:03:08.522
Evidence indicates the robberies
have occurred over a period of time.

15
00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:12.776
Sheriff Jesus Maldonado refused
to give details of the ghoulish case

16
00:03:12.861 --> 00:03:15.237
and said only that
he did have strong evidence

17
00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:18.365
linking the crime to elements
outside the state.

18
00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.743
Area residents have reportedly converged
on the cemetery,

19
00:03:21.828 --> 00:03:24.746
fearing the remains of relatives
have been removed.

20
00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:28.917
No suspects are in custody, as
the investigation at the scene continues.

21
00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:32.838
Oil storage units
continue to burn out of control

22
00:03:32.922 --> 00:03:36.925
at the huge Texaco refinery
near the Texas-Louisiana border.

23
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.678
Three storage units exploded
into flames during the night,

24
00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:43.223
killing at least three workers
and injuring a dozen more.

25
00:03:43.308 --> 00:03:47.436
Fire-fighting units in three Texas cities
continue to battle the holocaust,

26
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.105
in an effort to confine 40-foot flames.

27
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.985
Smoke from the fire is visible to Houston
residents some 60 miles to the south.

28
00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.738
Health officials in San Francisco
reluctantly admit

29
00:03:57.822 --> 00:04:00.407
they may have a cholera epidemic
on their hands.

30
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:04.995
Some 40 cases of the highly infectious
disease have been confirmed.

31
00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.540
(news report continues indistinct)

32
00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:12.044
...is responsible for spread of the disease.

33
00:04:12.128 --> 00:04:14.880
Houston police are puzzled over
an outbreak of violence

34
00:04:14.964 --> 00:04:17.424
apparently touched off by a suicide.

35
00:04:17.508 --> 00:04:22.054
A young man, reportedly angered by a
local television blackout of a sports event,

36
00:04:22.138 --> 00:04:24.890
jumped from the tenth-story window
of his apartment.

37
00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:29.061
A second man allegedly threatened to
leap to his death from the same window,

38
00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:31.230
but was restrained by police.

39
00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:34.566
Witnesses to the incident
reportedly heard the man jump...

40
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:37.694
(news report continues indistinct)

41
00:04:45.078 --> 00:04:47.579
She offered no explanation for the attack.

42
00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:52.709
The lieutenant was treated for minor
wounds at the hospital and released.

43
00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:57.547
A 16-story building under construction
in downtown Atlanta collapsed today,

44
00:04:57.632 --> 00:05:00.008
killing at least 29 persons.

45
00:05:00.093 --> 00:05:04.096
The engineering firm responsible for
the structural design of the building

46
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.974
could offer no explanation for the collapse.

47
00:05:07.058 --> 00:05:11.270
The construction firm says
there's no logical reason for the collapse

48
00:05:11.354 --> 00:05:13.939
and suspects sabotage.

49
00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:16.984
Police in Gary, Indiana,
have been unable to identify

50
00:05:17.068 --> 00:05:19.194
the bodies of a young man and woman...

51
00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.405
(continues indistinct)

52
00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:27.202
...stab wounds
and their features carved away.

53
00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:29.413
The man's genitals had been removed,

54
00:05:29.497 --> 00:05:32.958
and police first identified the victims
as two women.

55
00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:35.752
(news report continues low)

56
00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:52.227
OK?

57
00:06:15.835 --> 00:06:17.169
(screams)

58
00:06:18.588 --> 00:06:20.213
Franklin!

59
00:06:24.093 --> 00:06:26.636
Ah!

60
00:06:30.892 --> 00:06:34.269
- Are you OK?
- I was... Shit.

61
00:06:37.106 --> 00:06:38.190
OK.

62
00:06:38.274 --> 00:06:42.027
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take much more.

63
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:45.822
Listen, the condition of retrogradation
is contrary or inharmonious to

64
00:06:45.907 --> 00:06:49.284
the regular direction
of actual movement in the zodiac

65
00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:52.120
and is, in that respect, evil.

66
00:06:52.205 --> 00:06:54.998
Hence, when malefic planets
are in retrograde -

67
00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:59.294
and Saturn's malefic, OK? -
their maleficence is increased.

68
00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:02.047
Have you been doing
those word power columns?

69
00:07:02.131 --> 00:07:04.508
It just means that Saturn's a bad influence.

70
00:07:04.592 --> 00:07:08.970
It's just particularly a bad influence now
because it's in retrograde.

71
00:07:09.055 --> 00:07:12.140
- You believe that stuff she's hawking me?
- I don't know.

72
00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:34.454
My granddaddy's buried here.
Did anything happen to him?

73
00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:37.207
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- That big feller

74
00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:40.877
at the stand with that flashlight in his hand,
that's the sheriff.

75
00:07:40.962 --> 00:07:44.089
You tell him your granddaddy's
buried in there.

76
00:07:44.173 --> 00:07:45.799
- He'll let you in.
- Thank you.

77
00:07:45.883 --> 00:07:50.053
I'm gonna run off with your girl a minute.
Honey, I'll get you the sheriff.

78
00:07:50.138 --> 00:07:53.223
Let us through.
This girl's granddaddy's buried here.

79
00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:56.059
Been in there the whole time,
unbeknownst to Clyde.

80
00:07:56.144 --> 00:07:59.062
Clyde didn't know, either.
They didn't know why...

81
00:07:59.147 --> 00:08:02.983
Things happen hereabout
they don't tell about.

82
00:08:05.403 --> 00:08:07.988
I see things.

83
00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:16.204
You see, they say
it's just an old man talking.

84
00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:19.541
You laugh at an old man.

85
00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:24.546
There's them that laughs and knows better.

86
00:08:31.804 --> 00:08:36.016
(Sally) They're sure. The man said they
could tell if the grave had been dug up.

87
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.687
Franklin, don't worry. I saw it myself.
It didn't look dug up to me.

88
00:08:44.734 --> 00:08:48.028
- (Sally) Oh, what's that?
- What smells?

89
00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:52.240
What is that stench?

90
00:08:52.325 --> 00:08:54.701
Roll up the window.

91
00:08:56.537 --> 00:09:00.499
Hey, that's the old slaughterhouse.

92
00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:04.377
That's where Grandpa used to
sell his cattle.

93
00:09:04.462 --> 00:09:08.298
We got an uncle that works at one of
those places outside of Ft. Worth.

94
00:09:08.382 --> 00:09:13.845
That's where they kill them. They bash
them in the head with a sledgehammer.

95
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.933
- (Pam) That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill 'em on the first lick.

96
00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:38.411
They'd start squealing and freaking out,
and they'd have to bash 'em three times.

97
00:09:38.496 --> 00:09:42.123
They'd skin them sometimes
before they were even dead.

98
00:09:42.208 --> 00:09:46.169
(Pam) That's horrible.
People shouldn't kill animals for food.

99
00:09:46.254 --> 00:09:48.213
They don't do it like that anymore.

100
00:09:48.297 --> 00:09:52.551
Now they got this big gun that shoots
a bolt into their skull, then retracts it.

101
00:09:52.635 --> 00:09:55.136
It's just boom! It goes boom!
And boom!

102
00:09:55.221 --> 00:09:58.181
Franklin, I like meat.
Please change the subject.

103
00:09:58.266 --> 00:10:01.893
- Boom!
- That's terrible. It's still going on.

104
00:10:03.896 --> 00:10:06.314
Oh, man, it's hot in here.

105
00:10:12.822 --> 00:10:15.073
- Hitchhiker.
- Should we pick him up?

106
00:10:15.157 --> 00:10:18.493
- Yeah. He'll asphyxiate out there.
- What does he look like?

107
00:10:18.578 --> 00:10:21.246
Son of a bitch is gonna
smell like a slaughterhouse.

108
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.207
Oh, give the guy a break.
He can sit by Franklin.

109
00:10:24.292 --> 00:10:26.251
- What do you want to do?
- He's weird-looking.

110
00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:27.961
- Pick him up, man.
- No!

111
00:10:46.856 --> 00:10:49.733
Well, I think we just picked up Dracula.

112
00:10:49.817 --> 00:10:52.611
- Where you headed, man?
- South.

113
00:10:52.695 --> 00:10:54.738
You work at that place?

114
00:10:54.822 --> 00:10:56.615
Oh, no.

115
00:10:56.699 --> 00:11:00.869
- How did you get stuck way out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.

116
00:11:00.953 --> 00:11:04.789
- My uncle works for the slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.

117
00:11:04.874 --> 00:11:07.083
My-my grandfather too.

118
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.962
My family's always been in meat.

119
00:11:11.088 --> 00:11:13.632
A whole family of Draculas.

120
00:11:14.383 --> 00:11:17.177
Hey, man, did you go
in that slaughter room?

121
00:11:17.261 --> 00:11:19.929
Where they shoot the cattle
with that big air gun?

122
00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:24.517
- Oh, that-that-that gun's no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.

123
00:11:24.602 --> 00:11:27.312
The old way with a sledge.

124
00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:31.066
See, that was better.
They died better that way.

125
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.193
How come? I thought the gun was better.

126
00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:35.487
Oh, no, no.

127
00:11:35.571 --> 00:11:39.074
With the new way,
the people are put out of jobs.

128
00:11:39.158 --> 00:11:41.159
You do that?

129
00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:42.577
Look.

130
00:11:48.084 --> 00:11:50.502
- I was the killer. (laughs)
- Damn.

131
00:11:50.586 --> 00:11:53.838
- (Sally) Let me see them.
- They don't send the heads away.

132
00:11:53.923 --> 00:11:56.007
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:56.092 --> 00:11:57.759
Franklin.

134
00:11:59.303 --> 00:12:02.806
See, they make head cheese.

135
00:12:03.474 --> 00:12:04.766
They...

136
00:12:06.227 --> 00:12:08.186
they take the head,

137
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.022
and they boil it,
except for the tongue,

138
00:12:11.107 --> 00:12:14.776
and they scrape all the flesh
away from the bone.

139
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.779
They use everything.
They don't throw nothing way.

140
00:12:17.863 --> 00:12:19.864
They use the jowls

141
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:23.827
and the muscles and the eyes
and ligaments and everything.

142
00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:25.704
- Oh.
- Look at this.

143
00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:30.875
The nose and the gums and all the flesh,
and they boil it down into a big jelly of fat.

144
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.586
Wow. I didn't know
that's what was in that stuff.

145
00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:36.005
It's really good. You like it?

146
00:12:36.632 --> 00:12:39.384
Oh, yeah, sure, I like it.
It's good.

147
00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:42.929
It sounds horrible.
Could we talk about something else?

148
00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.557
You'd like it
if you didn't know what was in it.

149
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:48.393
I wouldn't,
and I wish you'd stop talking about it.

150
00:12:48.477 --> 00:12:49.728
Oh.

151
00:12:49.812 --> 00:12:52.147
Come on, you're making everybody sick.

152
00:12:52.231 --> 00:12:54.232
Oh, all right.

153
00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:02.198
(chuckles)

154
00:13:09.915 --> 00:13:11.958
(Sally) What are you doing?

155
00:13:13.586 --> 00:13:16.421
Hey, man, put that knife up.

156
00:13:19.508 --> 00:13:21.342
(laughs)

157
00:13:22.762 --> 00:13:24.179
(Sally gasps) Oh!

158
00:13:24.263 --> 00:13:26.306
(Kirk) Oh, come on.

159
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:29.309
(Sally) Oh! What are you doing to yourself?

160
00:13:30.311 --> 00:13:33.396
Oh, my God!
Why are you doing that?

161
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:41.404
(laughing)

162
00:13:42.907 --> 00:13:44.532
Put that away.

163
00:13:44.617 --> 00:13:47.619
(♪ "Fool for a Blonde" plays on radio)

164
00:14:06.222 --> 00:14:08.223
I have this knife.

165
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:11.059
Put that away, too.

166
00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:15.814
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.

167
00:14:15.898 --> 00:14:17.899
Fold it up.

168
00:14:20.236 --> 00:14:22.237
(chuckles)

169
00:14:59.358 --> 00:15:01.693
Hey, you took my picture.

170
00:15:01.777 --> 00:15:04.612
Hey, you-you could take me to my house.

171
00:15:04.697 --> 00:15:07.198
I live right off this road.

172
00:15:07.283 --> 00:15:11.369
Well, I don't know, man.
We're in pretty much of a hurry.

173
00:15:12.371 --> 00:15:14.539
- How close is it?
- It's real close.

174
00:15:14.623 --> 00:15:19.294
Well, couldn't you just walk?
I mean, if it's so close.

175
00:15:19.378 --> 00:15:22.380
Yeah, you could have dinner with us.

176
00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:26.384
You like head cheese?
My brother makes it real good. You'll like it.

177
00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:30.346
I think you better push on now.
Don't you, Jerry?

178
00:15:30.973 --> 00:15:32.640
Yeah, I'm sorry.

179
00:15:43.402 --> 00:15:45.403
(laughs)

180
00:15:54.747 --> 00:15:57.123
It didn't turn out so good.

181
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.586
- It's a nice picture. You can pay me now.
- Huh?

182
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.589
Two dollars. It's a good picture.

183
00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:08.217
No, man.
Franklin, give him back the damn picture.

184
00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:10.762
- He tried to sell him that picture.
- You're kidding?

185
00:16:10.846 --> 00:16:12.889
No, I'm serious.

186
00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.926
(screaming)

187
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.387
What are you doing?

188
00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:55.056
(all yelling)

189
00:16:56.892 --> 00:16:59.352
(Kirk) Hey, Jerry, pull us over!

190
00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:03.106
(Franklin) Hey, man, what's up?
What are you doing?

191
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.024
(screaming)

192
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.281
Get out.

193
00:17:36.849 --> 00:17:38.474
(cries)

194
00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:40.518
Oh, my God.

195
00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:43.563
Oh, I'm about half ready to call a cop.

196
00:17:43.647 --> 00:17:47.483
That's the last goddamn hitchhiker
I ever pick up.

197
00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:57.618
(Pam) Hey, listen to Franklin's horoscope.

198
00:17:57.703 --> 00:17:58.953
Oh, Sally.

199
00:17:59.038 --> 00:18:02.457
"Travel in the country,
long-range plans

200
00:18:02.541 --> 00:18:04.834
"and upsetting persons around you

201
00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:09.297
"could make this a disturbing
and unpredictable day.

202
00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:13.593
The events in the world are not
doing much either to cheer one up."

203
00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:17.305
- That's just perfect.
- Franklin, I think that will be all right.

204
00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:20.808
And now read Sally's.
She's a Capricorn.

205
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.359
Oh, no.

206
00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:32.820
Capricorn's ruled by Saturn.

207
00:18:34.198 --> 00:18:38.367
"There are moments when we cannot
believe that what is happening is true.

208
00:18:38.452 --> 00:18:41.579
Pinch yourself
and you may find out that it is."

209
00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:44.373
(♪ country music playing on radio)

210
00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:10.149
Everybody out.

211
00:19:13.362 --> 00:19:15.655
Hurry up, so we can get home.

212
00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:25.957
Here comes somebody.

213
00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:33.548
How are you?

214
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.052
Would you fill her up, please?

215
00:19:38.554 --> 00:19:40.972
I got no gas.

216
00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:44.225
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.

217
00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:47.478
The transport won't be here
until late this afternoon,

218
00:19:47.563 --> 00:19:51.399
maybe not even until tomorrow morning.

219
00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:55.153
(Franklin) Hey, do you know where
the old Franklin place is?

220
00:19:59.283 --> 00:20:01.617
- The old Franklin place?
- Yeah.

221
00:20:01.702 --> 00:20:04.370
It's an old two-story rock house on a hill.

222
00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:08.916
I think you have to turn on that road
back there, but I'm not real sure.

223
00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:13.254
Yeah, maybe I seen something like that
up that way.

224
00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:19.343
Well, now look, you boys don't want
to go messing around no old house.

225
00:20:19.428 --> 00:20:22.388
Those things is dangerous.
You're liable to get hurt.

226
00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:24.056
We'll be careful.

227
00:20:24.141 --> 00:20:27.810
You don't want to go fooling around
with other folks' property.

228
00:20:27.895 --> 00:20:30.938
Some folks don't like it,
and they don't mind showing you.

229
00:20:31.023 --> 00:20:34.525
- Oh, my father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?

230
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.568
Yeah.

231
00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:38.863
Look, I got some good barbeque here.

232
00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.657
Why don't you fellas
stick around here a while?

233
00:20:41.742 --> 00:20:45.077
That transport will be by in a little while.

234
00:20:46.622 --> 00:20:49.874
(Jerry) Well, you want to get
some barbeque?

235
00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:55.046
Them girls, now, they don't want to
go messing around an old house.

236
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.673
It's best you stick around here.

237
00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:11.854
We should've asked
if there's another gas station around.

238
00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:14.899
Don't you think he would've told us
if there was?

239
00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:18.194
Man, it wouldn't hurt to ask, you know?

240
00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:20.321
OK, I'll go ask.

241
00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:27.203
I knew the hell we should've
stopped back there for gas.

242
00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:29.789
- Press it.
- I'm pulling it down.

243
00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:32.875
- There.
- You think this place has room service?

244
00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:38.589
Franklin, you maniac,
you're tearing up the van.

245
00:21:38.674 --> 00:21:42.593
Um, yeah, I just started doing that.

246
00:21:46.932 --> 00:21:49.850
Hey, I bet that's some of that guy's blood.

247
00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:52.937
Look at that. Look at that.

248
00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:56.357
- You think that's blood?
- Yeah, I guess so.

249
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:03.906
Oh, that's blood, all right.
And that guy cut the hell out of himself.

250
00:22:03.991 --> 00:22:07.118
You think you could do that to yourself?

251
00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:10.955
- I'm not crazy.
- Yeah, yeah.

252
00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:17.044
It takes something, though, I mean just
to do that to yourself like he did. God!

253
00:22:19.172 --> 00:22:22.300
Hey, you think I said something
made him mad?

254
00:22:22.384 --> 00:22:24.302
(laughs)

255
00:22:24.386 --> 00:22:28.514
- Well, what?
- Franklin, you're crazier than he was.

256
00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:32.768
Hey, I got us some barbeque.

257
00:22:32.853 --> 00:22:36.731
- Newt's the closest place to get gas.
- (Sally) Aw.

258
00:22:41.653 --> 00:22:45.865
Aren't we going out to Grandpa's place?
There's a creek. You could go swimming.

259
00:22:45.949 --> 00:22:47.241
(Jerry) Let's go.

260
00:22:47.326 --> 00:22:49.493
Come on, Sally.
We're going to Grandpa's place.

261
00:22:49.578 --> 00:22:50.870
Let's go!

262
00:22:50.954 --> 00:22:55.082
(Sally) Hey, that guy smeared blood
all over the van.

263
00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:59.754
- Like he was trying to write something.
- (Franklin) What'd he do?

264
00:22:59.838 --> 00:23:02.506
Did he write something on the van?

265
00:23:23.362 --> 00:23:25.404
Let me see your knife.

266
00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:30.409
Thank you.

267
00:23:36.917 --> 00:23:40.378
Franklin, if we run out of gas
before we get back to that station,

268
00:23:40.462 --> 00:23:43.381
you're towing us back in your chair.

269
00:23:43.465 --> 00:23:45.800
(Sally laughs)

270
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:56.310
Hey, you think that guy's
just trying to scare us

271
00:23:56.395 --> 00:23:59.772
by, you know,
blowing up my picture like that?

272
00:24:45.694 --> 00:24:49.321
(Sally) Oh, I wish they hadn't
let the place fall apart.

273
00:24:50.323 --> 00:24:53.409
(Kirk) It looks like the birth place
of Bela Lugosi.

274
00:24:53.493 --> 00:24:55.536
- (Sally) I'm scared.
- I'll help you with that.

275
00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.747
- See that window over there?
- That's strange.

276
00:25:03.628 --> 00:25:06.297
(Franklin) Hey, watch my arms.
Watch out.

277
00:25:06.381 --> 00:25:10.134
- Be straight. Come on. Hey.
- I'll get you from here.

278
00:25:10.218 --> 00:25:14.346
(Franklin) I want to see that smear
that guy made.

279
00:25:19.352 --> 00:25:23.898
- Oh, man.
- Weird. I wonder if that means something.

280
00:25:23.982 --> 00:25:25.983
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's going to get you.

281
00:25:26.067 --> 00:25:27.985
- Come on.
- Why don't you wash it off?

282
00:25:28.069 --> 00:25:30.488
I want to show you the inside.

283
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:33.282
- Jerry!
- OK.

284
00:25:35.118 --> 00:25:37.620
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

285
00:25:37.704 --> 00:25:41.373
- Come on, Kirk.
- Here, man, you wash it off.

286
00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:44.168
You don't think that guy would try
and follow us?

287
00:25:44.252 --> 00:25:46.504
What for?

288
00:25:57.891 --> 00:25:59.850
Where's my knife? Kirk?

289
00:25:59.935 --> 00:26:02.102
(Sally laughs)

290
00:26:02.938 --> 00:26:05.231
It looks like it must've been a nursery.

291
00:26:05.315 --> 00:26:09.026
This is my room. I got to stay here one time
when I was eight years old.

292
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.987
- Right after my grandmother died.
- What happened?

293
00:26:12.072 --> 00:26:15.324
- What happened to my grandmother?
- Yeah. She died.

294
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.330
(girls laughing)

295
00:26:34.511 --> 00:26:36.720
(skittering sound)

296
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.352
(talking and laughing)

297
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:52.653
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- It's seen better days.

298
00:26:52.737 --> 00:26:55.531
These animals used to talk me to sleep
when I was little.

299
00:26:55.615 --> 00:26:58.951
Look at the zebras.
I had these fascination for the zebras.

300
00:27:00.704 --> 00:27:02.496
Sally!

301
00:27:09.838 --> 00:27:11.839
(grunting)

302
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.025
Sally!

303
00:28:06.144 --> 00:28:23.077
(laughing)

304
00:28:24.204 --> 00:28:27.206
Hee-hee-hee-hee, hee-hee-hee-hee.

305
00:28:28.625 --> 00:28:30.626
Hee-hee-hee-hee.

306
00:28:35.173 --> 00:28:37.466
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.

307
00:28:38.927 --> 00:28:42.471
(mimicking) Come on, Franklin.
It's gonna be a fun trip.

308
00:28:51.064 --> 00:28:55.776
If I have any more fun today,
I don't think I'm going to be able to take it.

309
00:28:59.823 --> 00:29:01.490
Aah! Ah!

310
00:29:01.574 --> 00:29:03.617
(sobs)

311
00:29:05.912 --> 00:29:08.330
(raspberries)

312
00:29:10.542 --> 00:29:12.751
(laughing)

313
00:29:14.629 --> 00:29:17.798
- Hey, Franklin.
- Hey, Franklin. What's wrong?

314
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.093
You said there was a swimming hole
around here?

315
00:29:21.177 --> 00:29:22.678
Yeah.

316
00:29:23.638 --> 00:29:27.141
Well, Pam and I would like to go swimming,
man.

317
00:29:28.643 --> 00:29:33.772
Uh, there used to be a trail
down between those two old sheds.

318
00:29:33.857 --> 00:29:35.858
Come on, we'll find it.

319
00:29:37.986 --> 00:29:43.240
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- (Kirk) No. We'll see you in an hour or so.

320
00:29:44.534 --> 00:29:48.662
Yeah.
We'll see you in about an hour or so.

321
00:29:54.002 --> 00:29:56.170
(rattling sound)

322
00:30:08.183 --> 00:30:13.187
Sally?

323
00:30:17.692 --> 00:30:19.401
Sally!

324
00:30:30.121 --> 00:30:32.247
Zero in the world.

325
00:30:33.249 --> 00:30:36.210
Just shoot him
and put us out of our misery.

326
00:30:38.046 --> 00:30:40.297
- Snakes and spiders!
- Stop it!

327
00:30:40.381 --> 00:30:43.675
And scorpions! Man-eating lizards.

328
00:30:48.598 --> 00:30:51.433
- Kirk, help. Kirk!
- Ow. Ow.

329
00:30:51.518 --> 00:30:53.018
Oh.

330
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.729
Crap.

331
00:30:59.317 --> 00:31:01.527
This must be it.

332
00:31:01.611 --> 00:31:04.154
Oh, are you OK?

333
00:31:04.239 --> 00:31:07.491
How the hell did Franklin
ever get down here, anyway?

334
00:31:07.575 --> 00:31:11.328
Somebody must've carried him
when he was little.

335
00:31:11.412 --> 00:31:13.747
Franklin never was little.

336
00:31:15.792 --> 00:31:18.252
(motor sound)

337
00:31:22.966 --> 00:31:25.050
Gasoline.

338
00:31:25.593 --> 00:31:30.472
I can leave him my guitar, give him a
couple bucks. We're coming back anyway.

339
00:31:30.557 --> 00:31:34.101
I can pick up my guitar, give him a couple
more dollars and bring him some gas.

340
00:31:34.185 --> 00:31:37.271
They don't want your guitar.
They won't want to sell us gas.

341
00:31:37.355 --> 00:31:39.731
Let's just go back now.

342
00:32:21.524 --> 00:32:23.817
Hey, come here.

343
00:32:23.902 --> 00:32:25.944
Come here and look at this.

344
00:32:50.887 --> 00:32:53.513
- A generator.
- What?

345
00:32:53.598 --> 00:32:56.558
A generator! For electricity.

346
00:32:59.354 --> 00:33:02.481
Hey, hello in there! Is anybody here?

347
00:33:36.557 --> 00:33:46.942
(knocking on door)

348
00:33:47.026 --> 00:33:49.069
Hello, is anybody home?

349
00:34:10.758 --> 00:34:12.843
I got something for you.

350
00:34:16.681 --> 00:34:17.973
Ah!

351
00:34:18.057 --> 00:34:19.057
Ooh!

352
00:34:19.934 --> 00:34:21.935
Let's go!

353
00:34:25.732 --> 00:34:38.827
Hello?

354
00:34:39.954 --> 00:34:42.414
- Hey, Pam, come look at this.
- What? No!

355
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:48.295
Hello?

356
00:34:51.716 --> 00:34:53.717
Is anybody home?

357
00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:56.219
Hello?

358
00:34:56.304 --> 00:34:57.971
(knocking)

359
00:35:01.768 --> 00:35:05.103
(sound of pig squealing)

360
00:35:07.607 --> 00:35:09.608
Hey, Pam.

361
00:35:11.444 --> 00:35:14.071
(sound of pig squealing)

362
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:18.116
Hello?

363
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:42.974
Kirk?

364
00:35:56.739 --> 00:35:58.240
Kirk!

365
00:36:06.958 --> 00:36:18.885
Kirk?

366
00:36:42.785 --> 00:36:44.369
Kirk.

367
00:36:46.205 --> 00:36:47.664
(rustling)

368
00:36:47.748 --> 00:36:49.249
Kirk?

369
00:36:50.459 --> 00:36:57.799
(rustling)

370
00:36:57.884 --> 00:36:59.551
Kirk?

371
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:06.933
(chicken clucking)

372
00:38:42.238 --> 00:38:44.406
(coughs and retches)

373
00:38:49.078 --> 00:38:50.954
Oh! Oh, God!

374
00:38:51.038 --> 00:38:52.831
(cries)

375
00:39:00.214 --> 00:39:02.507
Kirk! Kirk!

376
00:39:03.801 --> 00:39:05.135
(man screaming)

377
00:39:05.219 --> 00:39:07.137
(Pam screaming)

378
00:39:49.096 --> 00:39:51.389
(chainsaw motor whirs)

379
00:40:11.494 --> 00:40:13.828
(screaming)

380
00:40:25.383 --> 00:40:27.675
(Jerry) He's gonna get you, Franklin.

381
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:32.555
- You don't think it means anything?
- (Sally) We'll protect you.

382
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.518
- I'll bet it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.

383
00:40:38.229 --> 00:40:42.315
- It probably doesn't mean anything, huh?
- You worry too much.

384
00:40:43.275 --> 00:40:47.070
He couldn't find us anyway.
I mean, he doesn't even know our names.

385
00:40:47.154 --> 00:40:49.697
I gave him your name.
I told him where you live.

386
00:40:49.782 --> 00:40:52.409
I even gave him your zip code.
He's gonna kill you.

387
00:40:52.493 --> 00:40:54.077
Jerry.

388
00:40:55.204 --> 00:40:58.415
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.

389
00:40:58.499 --> 00:41:01.793
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife.

390
00:41:01.877 --> 00:41:03.962
When did you have it last?

391
00:41:05.506 --> 00:41:08.925
Well, I didn't have it last.
You had it last.

392
00:41:09.009 --> 00:41:11.594
I gave it to you. Remember?
What did you do with it?

393
00:41:11.679 --> 00:41:14.097
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?

394
00:41:14.181 --> 00:41:17.267
No. I didn't have it
when I got out of the van.

395
00:41:17.351 --> 00:41:22.105
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right, I'll look for it.

396
00:41:22.189 --> 00:41:26.651
I think I'll walk down to the creek
before it gets too dark. How do I get there?

397
00:41:26.735 --> 00:41:31.156
Well, there's a trail down there
between them two old sheds.

398
00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.492
- Can I go, too?
- I think you'd better stay here.

399
00:41:35.619 --> 00:41:37.620
All right.

400
00:41:45.254 --> 00:41:47.255
I can't find it.

401
00:41:54.513 --> 00:41:56.973
Are you mad at me?

402
00:41:57.057 --> 00:41:59.559
No, I'm not mad at you.

403
00:42:02.813 --> 00:42:04.898
You really are mad, huh?

404
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.902
Oh, I don't blame you.

405
00:42:08.986 --> 00:42:10.236
I'm...

406
00:42:10.321 --> 00:42:12.113
Kirk!

407
00:42:22.249 --> 00:42:25.877
You really didn't want me to come,
did you?

408
00:42:25.961 --> 00:42:29.255
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.

409
00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.549
It's been a long day.

410
00:42:35.346 --> 00:42:38.181
Sally, did you believe in all that stuff

411
00:42:38.265 --> 00:42:43.019
that Pam was telling about
Saturn and retrograde and all that?

412
00:42:43.103 --> 00:42:47.440
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.

413
00:42:47.525 --> 00:42:48.983
Yeah.

414
00:42:52.947 --> 00:42:56.032
You don't think that guy
would try and follow us, do you?

415
00:42:56.116 --> 00:42:59.744
Well, I mean, there's no way
that he could follow us.

416
00:43:02.998 --> 00:43:06.167
He's probably afraid Kirk will kill him.

417
00:43:12.675 --> 00:43:13.841
Sally?

418
00:43:13.926 --> 00:43:16.010
What now?

419
00:43:19.306 --> 00:43:21.015
Nothing.

420
00:43:23.519 --> 00:43:25.520
Never mind.

421
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:32.360
Kirk!

422
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:03.850
Hello?

423
00:44:07.855 --> 00:44:09.856
Is anybody home?

424
00:44:13.902 --> 00:44:16.446
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.

425
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.031
Hello?

426
00:44:23.162 --> 00:44:25.204
Is anybody here?

427
00:44:28.375 --> 00:44:29.876
Damn.

428
00:44:45.392 --> 00:44:46.976
(chicken clucks)

429
00:44:47.061 --> 00:44:48.394
Kirk?

430
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:53.441
- Are you guys in there?
- (person chuckles)

431
00:44:55.402 --> 00:44:58.988
Hey, guys, quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.

432
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.788
(person laughing)

433
00:45:07.539 --> 00:45:09.582
Pam, is that you?

434
00:45:10.292 --> 00:45:12.418
(person laughing)

435
00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.421
OK, you guys.

436
00:45:19.009 --> 00:45:21.886
Come on out. Come on!

437
00:45:32.189 --> 00:45:33.189
(knocking)

438
00:45:33.273 --> 00:45:34.774
Kirk?

439
00:45:43.409 --> 00:45:50.498
(knocking)

440
00:45:59.633 --> 00:46:01.968
- (man yells)
- (Jerry screams)

441
00:46:15.858 --> 00:46:17.859
(yelling)

442
00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.745
(chicken clucking)

443
00:47:23.175 --> 00:47:25.885
(honking)

444
00:47:33.977 --> 00:47:37.897
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.

445
00:47:37.981 --> 00:47:41.275
If they're not back in a minute,
we've got to go look for them.

446
00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.861
Well, what if we get lost, too?

447
00:47:45.405 --> 00:47:48.324
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station
and get help.

448
00:47:48.408 --> 00:47:51.410
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.

449
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.122
(Sally) Jerry!

450
00:47:56.583 --> 00:47:58.793
Jerry!

451
00:47:58.877 --> 00:48:01.295
(Franklin) Jerry!

452
00:48:02.881 --> 00:48:06.300
Jerry!

453
00:48:07.344 --> 00:48:09.554
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

454
00:48:10.514 --> 00:48:12.098
Hey!

455
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:19.564
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.

456
00:48:20.858 --> 00:48:24.026
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.

457
00:48:26.655 --> 00:48:28.322
Sally?

458
00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.034
I think we ought to go.

459
00:48:32.119 --> 00:48:34.120
(Sally sighs)

460
00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.456
Are the keys in the van?

461
00:48:39.793 --> 00:48:44.130
- Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
- What for?

462
00:48:44.214 --> 00:48:47.842
Let me see the flashlight. I'll go
look for them. You don't have to go.

463
00:48:47.926 --> 00:48:50.678
Sally, don't go.
I don't think that's a good idea.

464
00:48:50.762 --> 00:48:55.975
I don't think you ought to go.
I'm going to honk the horn one more time.

465
00:48:56.059 --> 00:48:58.060
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No.

466
00:48:58.145 --> 00:49:02.523
Now, I'm gonna honk the horn,
and we're gonna wait a minute,

467
00:49:02.608 --> 00:49:05.401
and then if they don't come, we'll go.

468
00:49:05.485 --> 00:49:07.486
All right?

469
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:16.412
Sally, they took the keys.
We don't have any keys.

470
00:49:16.496 --> 00:49:19.373
- They took the keys with them.
- (honking)

471
00:49:19.458 --> 00:49:23.294
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Franklin!

472
00:49:23.378 --> 00:49:26.380
- Jerry took the keys with him!
- Give me that flashlight!

473
00:49:26.465 --> 00:49:30.843
No, Sally, we can't go! Look, what if
they came back and we weren't here?

474
00:49:30.928 --> 00:49:34.805
- Give me that flashlight!
- No, I've got to take the flashlight.

475
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:39.518
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right, all right, I'll go with you.

476
00:49:39.603 --> 00:49:43.564
No, Sally. Come on, I'll go with you,
but I'm gonna keep the flashlight.

477
00:49:43.649 --> 00:49:46.317
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.

478
00:49:46.401 --> 00:49:49.487
I can't push you down that hill!

479
00:49:49.571 --> 00:49:53.449
Sally, look, I know. Oh!

480
00:49:53.533 --> 00:49:58.204
- I'll go with you, but I'm going to hold...
- Never mind, I'll just go without it.

481
00:49:59.247 --> 00:50:04.502
All right, all right. Sally, wait!
Sally, wait a minute! I'm coming with you.

482
00:50:04.586 --> 00:50:07.713
Sally? Hold up a minute now.

483
00:50:07.798 --> 00:50:09.799
All right, let's go.

484
00:50:09.883 --> 00:50:11.968
Let's go. I'll go with you.

485
00:50:13.178 --> 00:50:15.888
Sally, I can't keep up with you.

486
00:50:15.973 --> 00:50:17.974
Sally?

487
00:50:18.058 --> 00:50:20.226
Sally, wait a minute.

488
00:50:24.147 --> 00:50:26.649
(Franklin whimpers)

489
00:50:26.733 --> 00:50:28.734
Hold up.

490
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:40.705
(Franklin) Jerry!

491
00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:52.049
(Sally) Jerry!

492
00:50:53.427 --> 00:50:55.177
Jerry!

493
00:50:55.929 --> 00:50:59.682
(both) Jerry!

494
00:51:05.272 --> 00:51:07.440
(Franklin) Wait.

495
00:51:07.524 --> 00:51:11.861
- I thought I heard something.
- There's a light.

496
00:51:11.945 --> 00:51:13.946
- Yeah?
- Yes.

497
00:51:15.282 --> 00:51:18.534
(Sally) Oh, it looks like a house.

498
00:51:18.618 --> 00:51:21.912
Well, come on, push.
Come on, push.

499
00:51:21.997 --> 00:51:24.498
Push down. There. (grunts)

500
00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:34.341
- (Sally) It's a house.
- Yeah? I can't see it very well.

501
00:51:34.426 --> 00:51:37.678
Oh, Franklin, this is impossible.

502
00:51:37.763 --> 00:51:40.681
Come on, Sally.

503
00:51:40.766 --> 00:51:43.559
Get back and push down.

504
00:51:43.643 --> 00:51:45.686
This is impossible.

505
00:51:48.815 --> 00:51:50.900
I hear something out there.

506
00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:53.778
Look.

507
00:51:57.407 --> 00:51:59.575
- (Franklin) Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!

508
00:51:59.659 --> 00:52:01.702
(Franklin) Jerry!

509
00:52:09.252 --> 00:52:11.587
Sally, I hear something.
Stop. Stop.

510
00:52:11.671 --> 00:52:13.672
(sound of chainsaw)

511
00:52:13.757 --> 00:54:09.914
(screaming)

512
00:54:17.297 --> 00:54:19.298
Somebody, please!

513
00:54:20.133 --> 00:54:21.926
Help!

514
00:54:23.178 --> 00:54:25.387
Help me, please!

515
00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:30.476
Somebody, help me!

516
00:54:31.645 --> 00:54:43.739
(screaming)

517
00:54:56.169 --> 00:55:08.264
Help!

518
00:55:08.348 --> 00:55:10.849
Please! Please! Please help me!

519
00:55:11.518 --> 00:55:13.018
Please!

520
00:55:15.814 --> 00:55:21.235
(screams)

521
00:55:37.043 --> 00:57:29.363
(screaming)

522
00:57:44.379 --> 00:57:46.880
Help! Help me!

523
00:57:46.965 --> 00:57:48.549
Help!

524
00:57:51.511 --> 00:57:53.846
Help! Help!

525
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:55.222
Help!

526
00:57:57.183 --> 00:57:59.935
Help! Help me!

527
00:58:00.019 --> 00:58:03.230
Help me! Oh, God!
Help, help!

528
00:58:03.314 --> 00:58:06.108
Close the door. Help me.

529
00:58:06.192 --> 00:58:08.735
Whoa, there, whoa, whoa.

530
00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:11.613
- Come over here.
- Somebody's trying to kill me.

531
00:58:11.698 --> 00:58:14.533
Help, help...

532
00:58:14.617 --> 00:58:17.119
Calm down. You're all right, you're OK.

533
00:58:17.203 --> 00:58:19.746
- Oh, now, take it easy.
- Call the police.

534
00:58:19.831 --> 00:58:21.999
- He might come.
- Now, what happened?

535
00:58:22.083 --> 00:58:26.086
- He... he... he killed...
- Now, now, take it easy.

536
00:58:26.171 --> 00:58:29.131
He killed Franklin.
I don't know. Call the police!

537
00:58:29.215 --> 00:58:32.509
- Take it easy.
- And Jerry.

538
00:58:32.594 --> 00:58:35.929
I... I don't-I don't know
what happened to the others.

539
00:58:36.014 --> 00:58:38.223
There's nobody out there now.

540
00:58:38.308 --> 00:58:41.226
Come on. Come on now, take it easy.
Come on, take it easy.

541
00:58:41.311 --> 00:58:43.979
- Oh, please.
- What happened?

542
00:58:44.063 --> 00:58:47.649
Please. Call the police.

543
00:58:47.734 --> 00:58:50.736
There's no phone here.

544
00:58:50.862 --> 00:58:55.491
We... we have to drive over to Childress.

545
00:58:55.575 --> 00:58:58.160
Yeah, yeah.
Now, you take it easy.

546
00:58:58.244 --> 00:59:01.163
Take it easy now. I'll get the truck.

547
00:59:01.247 --> 00:59:03.999
- Now, now, take it easy. Take it easy.
- Don't go.

548
00:59:04.083 --> 00:59:06.502
Take it easy.

549
00:59:14.302 --> 00:59:18.138
(radio announcer) Weather is expected to
be warm to partly cloudy tomorrow

550
00:59:18.223 --> 00:59:20.641
with no chance of precipitation.

551
00:59:20.725 --> 00:59:24.394
The high today will be in the upper 90s
and a low tonight of 81 degrees.

552
00:59:24.479 --> 00:59:28.524
Current temperature is 96 with winds
out the southeast at three miles a hour.

553
00:59:28.608 --> 00:59:32.319
Humidity 98,
barometer is at 29.9 and rising.

554
00:59:32.403 --> 00:59:36.490
Acting on a tip,
the Muerto County sheriff's office

555
00:59:36.574 --> 00:59:40.577
began an investigation early this morning
in the Muerto County Cemetery

556
00:59:40.662 --> 00:59:43.872
opening crypts where there was
evidence of tampering.

557
00:59:43.957 --> 00:59:48.961
The sheriff's deputies found a reported
dozen coffins robbed of their contents.

558
00:59:49.045 --> 00:59:50.712
According to the sheriff,

559
00:59:50.797 --> 00:59:54.508
there were cadavers in which the heads
and extremities were removed,

560
00:59:54.592 --> 00:59:59.471
and others in which only a hand or foot
had been removed.

561
00:59:59.556 --> 01:00:02.391
Maldonado has information
linking the robberies

562
01:00:02.475 --> 01:00:06.395
to a large and well-organized
West Coast jewel theft ring

563
01:00:06.479 --> 01:00:11.567
but declined to suggest any reason
for them to mutilate the cadavers.

564
01:00:11.651 --> 01:00:15.153
(news report continues indistinct)

565
01:00:18.575 --> 01:00:20.826
(Sally crying and gasping)

566
01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:34.756
- What are you doing?
- You ain't got no need to worry.

567
01:00:34.841 --> 01:00:35.882
No!

568
01:00:35.967 --> 01:00:39.928
You just cooperate, young lady,
and we'll have no trouble.

569
01:00:41.306 --> 01:00:43.724
- Now, listen...
- What do you want?

570
01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:49.313
Now, there's no need to do that.
Nobody's going to hurt you.

571
01:00:49.397 --> 01:00:50.856
No!

572
01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:52.733
(screaming)

573
01:01:04.495 --> 01:01:05.871
(man laughs)

574
01:01:05.955 --> 01:01:08.123
No! No! No!

575
01:01:08.207 --> 01:01:10.834
(screams)

576
01:01:12.211 --> 01:01:14.212
(stops screaming)

577
01:02:13.439 --> 01:02:15.941
(Sally groans)

578
01:02:35.211 --> 01:02:38.004
(starts engine)

579
01:02:39.006 --> 01:02:41.007
(turns off engine)

580
01:02:56.441 --> 01:02:57.399
(chuckles)

581
01:02:57.483 --> 01:02:59.693
Had to lock up and get the lights.

582
01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:03.822
Cost of electricity is enough to
drive a man out of business.

583
01:03:03.906 --> 01:03:06.366
(starts engine)

584
01:03:14.167 --> 01:03:16.460
(Sally whimpers)

585
01:03:18.171 --> 01:03:20.255
(muffled crying)

586
01:03:29.015 --> 01:03:31.099
(muffled screaming)

587
01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:35.896
Uh, I hope you're not
too uncomfortable down there.

588
01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:37.981
(muffled screaming)

589
01:03:41.027 --> 01:03:46.615
You got nothing to worry about. You just
take it easy, and we'll be there soon.

590
01:03:46.699 --> 01:03:48.283
(laughs)

591
01:03:48.367 --> 01:03:50.535
(muffled crying)

592
01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:54.456
Now, now, now, now.

593
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.709
There's no need to do that, no.

594
01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:11.765
(Sally whimpering)

595
01:04:18.397 --> 01:04:20.899
(laughing)

596
01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:27.781
We'll be over this in a bit.

597
01:04:28.825 --> 01:04:30.826
Hang on.

598
01:04:39.836 --> 01:04:41.044
Halfwits.

599
01:04:46.759 --> 01:04:49.094
Little coon shits.

600
01:04:56.143 --> 01:04:59.688
- Come here, you nap-haired idiot!
- (grunts)

601
01:04:59.772 --> 01:05:02.858
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.

602
01:05:02.942 --> 01:05:06.903
You damn fool,
you almost got caught over at Duke's.

603
01:05:06.988 --> 01:05:10.073
No, no, they didn't see me.
They don't know nothing.

604
01:05:10.157 --> 01:05:13.702
I told you to stay away from that graveyard!

605
01:05:25.298 --> 01:05:27.340
(starts engine)

606
01:05:52.325 --> 01:05:56.036
I told you and I told you,

607
01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:59.915
I told you never to leave your brother alone,
you...

608
01:06:00.166 --> 01:06:04.419
Get in there and get that girl out of the car.
Come on, get her out of the car.

609
01:06:04.503 --> 01:06:08.340
- Get her out of there.
- (Sally screaming)

610
01:06:08.424 --> 01:06:11.801
Hopefully your brother
didn't let any of those kids get away.

611
01:06:11.886 --> 01:06:14.763
Get her in there.
We'll have the whole county out here.

612
01:06:14.847 --> 01:06:17.349
Don't you got any self-respect?

613
01:06:19.852 --> 01:06:23.104
Look what your brother did to the door!

614
01:06:23.189 --> 01:06:26.107
He's got no pride in his home?

615
01:06:26.192 --> 01:06:28.193
Get her in there.

616
01:06:33.407 --> 01:06:36.534
You've been a fool, you!

617
01:06:37.536 --> 01:06:40.080
You better get them other kids.

618
01:06:40.164 --> 01:06:42.582
Where are they, huh?

619
01:06:42.667 --> 01:06:53.051
(screaming)

620
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.554
You're a damn fool, you.

621
01:06:59.433 --> 01:07:01.851
- (screaming)
- (laughing)

622
01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:03.395
Oh!

623
01:07:03.479 --> 01:07:05.814
I thought you was in a hurry.

624
01:07:10.778 --> 01:07:13.363
Where are the kids?
Where are they? Show me!

625
01:07:13.447 --> 01:07:15.824
(Leatherface explaining)

626
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:21.037
- None of 'em get away?
- Uh-uh-uh.

627
01:07:21.122 --> 01:07:23.748
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

628
01:07:28.546 --> 01:07:30.005
You...

629
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:34.300
You damn fool! You ruined the door!

630
01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:40.765
(screaming)

631
01:07:43.936 --> 01:07:46.146
Hey, you did good. She's a nice girl.

632
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:50.358
You nitwit, get upstairs
and get your grandpa.

633
01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:10.795
Now, now, young lady,
you just take it easy there now.

634
01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.799
Look, we'll fix you some supper
in a few minutes. Huh?

635
01:08:17.428 --> 01:08:19.679
Get back in there!

636
01:08:23.059 --> 01:08:25.101
Get in there!

637
01:08:30.274 --> 01:08:32.859
Now, you just take it easy.

638
01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:34.944
Take it easy.

639
01:08:35.571 --> 01:08:38.615
We'll have you something to eat
right away.

640
01:09:04.725 --> 01:09:06.684
Hey.

641
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:08.853
Hey, Leatherface.

642
01:09:08.938 --> 01:09:11.314
Give me a hand with Grandpa.

643
01:09:26.872 --> 01:09:28.581
Careful.

644
01:09:43.389 --> 01:09:45.974
(muffled cries)

645
01:10:06.537 --> 01:10:08.746
Look, Grandpa, look, look.

646
01:10:35.566 --> 01:10:37.859
Here, here!

647
01:10:49.079 --> 01:10:51.122
(screaming)

648
01:11:35.834 --> 01:11:37.835
(flies buzzing)

649
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.505
(dishes and utensils clanking)

650
01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:01.859
(screaming)

651
01:12:04.697 --> 01:12:06.906
(howling)

652
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:24.924
Shut up!

653
01:12:25.009 --> 01:12:26.759
Quiet!

654
01:12:27.511 --> 01:12:29.554
You act like a pack of hounds.

655
01:12:29.638 --> 01:12:32.223
We were just having fun.

656
01:12:32.308 --> 01:12:34.600
You think this is a party?

657
01:12:35.352 --> 01:12:36.894
Please.

658
01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:40.398
You can make them stop.

659
01:12:40.482 --> 01:12:42.775
No, he can't. (laughs)

660
01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:45.278
Shut your mouths.

661
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:48.781
Can't be helped, young lady.

662
01:12:48.866 --> 01:12:52.243
- Oh, please, you can't let them kill me.
- Shut up.

663
01:12:52.328 --> 01:12:54.370
Don't pay him no mind.

664
01:12:55.914 --> 01:12:57.999
(sobbing)

665
01:13:00.544 --> 01:13:03.296
- You like this face?
- (screaming)

666
01:13:16.352 --> 01:13:20.855
You're crazy!
You've got to make them stop!

667
01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:22.899
Please!

668
01:13:22.983 --> 01:13:25.526
He's nothing. He's just the cook.

669
01:13:26.445 --> 01:13:29.197
Shut up, you bitch hog.

670
01:13:30.908 --> 01:13:34.452
Me and Leatherface do all the work.
He don't like it.

671
01:13:34.536 --> 01:13:36.913
Ain't that right?
You're just the cook!

672
01:13:36.997 --> 01:13:39.874
Shut your mouth!

673
01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:43.211
You don't understand nothing.

674
01:13:43.295 --> 01:13:47.006
I understand you ain't nothing.
Me and him do all the work!

675
01:13:47.091 --> 01:13:49.926
I just can't take no pleasure in killing.

676
01:13:53.222 --> 01:13:58.518
Well, there's just some things you got
to do. Don't mean you have to like it.

677
01:13:58.602 --> 01:14:01.437
Oh, please. Please.

678
01:14:02.481 --> 01:14:05.650
What do you want?
I'll do anything. Anything.

679
01:14:05.734 --> 01:14:07.485
(laughs)

680
01:14:08.028 --> 01:14:11.656
I'll do... I'll do anything you want.

681
01:15:01.957 --> 01:15:04.542
(Sally continues screaming)

682
01:15:15.637 --> 01:15:18.139
Don't need to torture the poor girl.

683
01:15:18.223 --> 01:15:22.518
You just shut up! Remember you're just
the cook, and me and him will handle this.

684
01:15:22.603 --> 01:15:25.688
Then get on with it.
I won't have this.

685
01:15:28.984 --> 01:15:32.653
We ain't in no hurry
because you ain't going no place.

686
01:15:32.738 --> 01:15:34.489
No.

687
01:15:34.573 --> 01:15:38.159
You hear me?
It might hurt you, but it don't mean much.

688
01:15:41.413 --> 01:15:43.623
No sense in waiting.

689
01:15:43.707 --> 01:15:45.875
I got to open up the room.

690
01:15:46.835 --> 01:15:51.964
I been... I been thinking about
letting Grandpa have some fun.

691
01:15:52.049 --> 01:15:54.258
You always said he's the best.

692
01:15:54.343 --> 01:15:56.344
He's the best, all right.

693
01:15:57.179 --> 01:16:02.642
Let's let him have a whack. Hey, Grandpa,
we going to let you have this one.

694
01:16:12.486 --> 01:16:14.570
Just let him have a whack.

695
01:16:17.449 --> 01:16:21.744
Now, you just hush.
It won't hurt none.

696
01:16:23.288 --> 01:16:27.208
Why, old Grandpa is the best killer
there ever was.

697
01:16:27.292 --> 01:16:30.836
Why, it never took more than one lick,
they say.

698
01:16:30.921 --> 01:16:34.131
Why, he did 60 in five minutes once.

699
01:16:34.216 --> 01:16:37.593
They say he could've done more
if the hook and pull gang

700
01:16:37.678 --> 01:16:41.514
could've gotten the beeves
out of the way faster.

701
01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:44.642
Now, now, don't you cry none.

702
01:16:44.726 --> 01:16:47.395
Old Grandpa's the best.
It won't hurt a bit.

703
01:16:49.815 --> 01:16:50.898
(screams)

704
01:16:50.983 --> 01:16:53.401
No! No!

705
01:16:56.572 --> 01:16:58.322
(screams)

706
01:16:58.407 --> 01:17:03.286
No! No!

707
01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:07.415
No! Oh, please don't!

708
01:17:07.499 --> 01:17:10.876
Please! Please! Please don't!

709
01:17:10.961 --> 01:17:13.170
No, no! No!

710
01:17:13.255 --> 01:17:15.339
(screaming)

711
01:17:23.223 --> 01:17:24.682
No!

712
01:17:25.684 --> 01:17:28.394
Hit her, Grandpa!

713
01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:30.563

714
01:17:32.941 --> 01:17:35.026
Hit her, Grandpa!

715
01:17:35.694 --> 01:17:37.612
Hit her! Come on, Grandpa.

716
01:17:39.656 --> 01:17:41.657

717
01:17:42.701 --> 01:17:45.077
Hit that bitch.

718
01:17:45.746 --> 01:17:47.830
Hit her, Grandpa!

719
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:50.791
Come on!

720
01:17:54.129 --> 01:17:56.130
Come on, Grandpa, hit that bitch.

721
01:17:56.214 --> 01:17:59.634
Careful there. Come on, Grandpa.

722
01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:03.137
Get her Grandpa, get her.

723
01:18:03.889 --> 01:18:06.140
Go ahead, go ahead! Get her!

724
01:18:18.028 --> 01:18:20.154
Come on.

725
01:18:20.238 --> 01:18:23.783
- Give me the hammer. I'll get her.
- Get her, get her, Grandpa.

726
01:18:23.867 --> 01:18:27.161
- Give me that hammer.
- Hit her, hit her, Grandpa.

727
01:18:27.245 --> 01:18:30.122
- I'll kill her. Let me get her.
- Hit the bitch.

728
01:18:55.941 --> 01:18:58.275
(chainsaw sound)

729
01:19:00.904 --> 01:19:13.457
(screaming)

730
01:19:40.986 --> 01:19:43.154
(truck horn)

731
01:19:52.247 --> 01:19:54.415
(screams) Help!

732
01:19:54.499 --> 01:19:56.167
(screaming)

733
01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:38.459
(screams)

734
01:20:52.808 --> 01:20:54.099
