00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:42,599
Hey, easy there, Berger.
What do you think you're doing?

2
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:44,518
- What?
- They're Helljumpers.

3
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:47,521
Every one of those guys
arw ODSTs from the 105th.

4
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:50,732
They're in a whole different league.
Let's go.

5
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,609
Come on.

6
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:53,777
I wanna hear what they're saying.

7
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:55,404
No.

8
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:57,656
I don't get it.

9
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,908
How did everybody conveniently forget...

10
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:02,286
that I'm the best shot
this side of Eridanus?

11
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:05,581
Getting assigned to backup
is a bunch of B.S.

12
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:08,876
Contingency. It's an important mission.

13
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:11,670
If the first sniper misses,
they take the shot.

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,589
I don't miss. I never miss.

15
00:01:13,756 --> 00:01:15,799
This sucks and you know it.

16
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,676
I'm nobody's babysitter.

17
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:20,888
Especially not some
farm-boy moose hunter.

18
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:23,140
I hate to be the one
to break the bad news...

19
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:26,560
but you weren't selected to be
the primary shooter on this mission.

20
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,564
So it seems they want your
farm boy to do it.

21
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:33,239
I guess that makes you the backup.
Sorry, O'Brian.

22
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:35,861
I'm the backup?

23
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,866
- And the shooter is a Spartan.
- What?

24
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,953
And that means
this mission just got escalated.

25
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,178
This is Spartan Cal-141...

26
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:03,889
who'll be the ranking officer
on this mission.

27
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,808
I realize that is highly unusual...

28
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:08,894
and you have strong feelings
about Spartans.

29
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:13,690
You will keep those feelings
out of the mission and follow the plan.

30
00:02:14,943 --> 00:02:17,653
Satellite rwcon shows radar
and magnetic signatures...

31
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,988
on high end in the Arc star cluster.

32
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:22,699
These signatures indicate
a complex of buildings.

33
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:24,368
It's a logistical base.

34
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:28,122
The Prophet you are targeting
is in control of this entire sector.

35
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:29,705
Our mission is simple.

36
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,875
We want this Prophet dead.

37
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:36,380
We take out the Prophet, we will
stop the Covenant chain of supply.

38
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:39,049
If we achieve the goal of this mission...

39
00:02:39,217 --> 00:02:42,386
we will able to buy ourselves months
of tactical advantage.

40
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:47,391
And we will do all of this
with minimal risk to the UNSC.

41
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:51,395
Other than to this group, of course.

42
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:52,888
Cortez,

43
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:55,908
fill them in on the details.

44
00:02:57,485 --> 00:03:01,780
Right. You'll be flying into the atmosphere
with a Leonid-class meteor shower.

45
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,908
Meteor showers of this nature are
a regular occurrence on this planet.

46
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:08,078
So that means entry and landing
should go unnoticed.

47
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:11,790
Calculations show reaching the target
will take a 14-hour fast march...

48
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,333
from your entry point.

49
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,002
Once you reach the target...

50
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,880
take out the Prophet
as soon as he steps off that ship.

51
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:22,893
Then you are to gather all data
relating to the unidentified alien ruins.

52
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:25,721
What do you mean,
they're not identified?

53
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,764
The architecture is
not Covenant-designed...

54
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:29,933
and it sure as hell
wasn't built by humans.

55
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:32,102
They predate both sides.

56
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,730
This site is of the utmost importance.

57
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:37,107
We photograph everything.

58
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,735
That will be all, master sergeant.
Rejoin your men.

59
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:42,529
You will be dropping
in precisely 5 minutes.

60
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:45,741
With this mission,
there is no room for delay or error.

61
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:49,244
Good luck, and Godspeed.

62
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,091
Dutch, come in.

63
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,635
I'm all right. Where's O'Brian?

64
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:35,058
Over therw.

65
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:51,283
His oxygen tank.

66
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,410
Dutch, get the gear.

67
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:55,287
We gotta get him out of there.

68
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:40,124
Are you guys nuts? Why are you
throwing me around like that?

69
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:53,679
We lost Checkman in the atmosphere.

70
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:57,433
- What?
- And we almost lost you too.

71
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:12,402
Their logistics and refueling base
is here.

72
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,782
We're here.

73
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,744
The Prophet will be coming in
at exactly 0800.

74
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:22,499
Everything depends on us getting
a clear shot from this location...

75
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:26,044
and we've got to hit him
as soon as he's exiting that ship.

76
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,838
It's 2 miles from the target...

77
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:30,674
and should give us the elevation
for the shot.

78
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:32,634
It's pretty far...

79
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:36,096
but it will give us enough cover
to make our extraction.

80
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:40,017
Assuming that the Spartan
can make the shot, that is.

81
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,898
And if we don't make it
to the target in time?

82
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,858
There won't be any second chances.

83
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:51,820
- It's a long-ass march.
- Then we better get marching.

84
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:18,222
Wanna take the lens cap off?

85
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:20,432
Knock it off, O'Brian.

86
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,437
I'm not crippled. Put me down.

87
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,656
You bitch any louder...

88
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:25,075
and this place will be
crawling with Covenant.

89
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:28,036
Shut your mouth!
He just got lucky.

90
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,472
That's twice.

91
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,433
Twice he had to save your dumb ass
already.

92
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:51,477
You could at least say "thank you. "

93
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:05,240
Man, those are some stairs.

94
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,124
The shuttle will be
touching down in 2 minutes.

95
00:13:00,964 --> 00:13:04,675
After all this, he better
be everything they said he was.

96
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,742
Take him out!

97
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:44,900
Take the shot. O'Brian, now!

98
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,278
You're the only one who can do it.

99
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:37,828
It's the data on the ruins.

100
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:41,832
Tell them...

101
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,252
to get it to Halsey.

102
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,921
She'll know.

103
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,549
No, you give it to her.

104
00:15:53,178 --> 00:15:54,687
We both know...

105
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,707
that's...
that's not gonna be possible.

106
00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:41,642
Heard about what you guys did
down there.

107
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:42,851
Took out a Prophet...

108
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,021
and stopped the Covenant's
supply chain dead for the sector.

109
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,190
They say a Spartan died there.

110
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:50,984
Went down faster than a new bood
on his first day.

111
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:54,530
I thought those guys
were supposed to be unbeatable.

112
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:59,618
I guess he didn't have what it takes
to hang with the Helljumpers?

113
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,161
Shut up.

114
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:06,208
What's your problem?
What the hell is the matter with you guys?

115
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:08,252
What'd I say?
