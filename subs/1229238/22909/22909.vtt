0
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:17,500
The last place you'd ever expect to find yourself

1
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:25,030
There was a time when
energy was a dirty word.

2
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:28,035
When turning on
your lights was a hard choice.

3
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,535
Cities in brownout.

4
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,785
Food shortages.

5
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,875
Cars burning fuel to run.

6
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,875
But that was the past.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,250
Where are we now?

8
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:38,755
How do we make the world so much better?

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,590
Make deserts bloom?

10
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:45,925
Right now, we're the largest producer of
fusion energy in the world.

11
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,305
The energy of the sun trapped in rock,

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,640
harvested by machine
from the far side of the moon.

13
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:55,520
Today, we deliver enough
clean-burning helium-3

14
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:59,150
to supply the energy needs
of nearly 70% of the planet.

15
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,735
Who'd have thought?

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,695
All the energy
we ever needed,

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,655
right above our heads.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,868
The power of the moon.

19
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:11,912
The power of our future.

20
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:28,780
Rock and roll. 8:32 Pacific Time.

21
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:30,824
All Harvesters running smoothly.

22
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,325
Readouts are as follows.

23
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,579
Matthew, 14.6 miles.

24
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:39,124
Mark, 16.8 miles. I...

25
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:50,802
Hey, Gerty. Gerty. We gotta...

26
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,138
Good morning, Sam.

27
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:54,806
We got a live one on Mark.

28
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:56,683
I'm gonna go out now and rope her in.

29
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,143
Okay, Sam.

30
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:55,825
I want chocolate.

31
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,329
I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

32
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:19,391
Searching for long-range comms.

33
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:24,771
Signal failure on long-range comms.

34
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:41,931
Sam Bell reporting
to Central. 10:14 Pacific Time.

35
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:46,478
I've got a full container
of helium-3 ready to roll.

36
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:49,314
By the time this message reaches you,
it should be in transit.

37
00:05:49,398 --> 00:05:51,858
Otherwise, everything running smoothly.

38
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:55,070
How are things down there?

39
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:58,156
You guys been to any

40
00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:01,201
good parties or anything?

41
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:04,746
Oh, thanks for the football feed.

42
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,458
It almost felt live... Almost.

43
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:12,670
But three years is a long haul, you know.

44
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:17,175
It's way, way, way, way, way too long.

45
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:21,221
I'm talking to myself on a regular basis.

46
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:23,807
So...

47
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:26,893
Time to go home, you know what I mean?

48
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,646
That's it. Over and out.

49
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,315
Rock and roll. God bless America.

50
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:52,752
I can do that for you, Sam.

51
00:06:56,757 --> 00:06:59,759
God damn it. I said I got it.

52
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:01,886
Why don't you listen to me?

53
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,939
Ready for launch.

54
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,380
Sam, is everything okay?

55
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:42,552
- Sam?
- What?

56
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:45,680
You don't seem
like yourself today.

57
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:47,098
- Has something happened?
- You know...

58
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:50,518
Can you turn that off?
Please. Jesus Christ.

59
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:56,065
Sam, it might help you
to talk about it.

60
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:02,447
Gerty, have you heard anything new
about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?

61
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:03,573
No, Sam.

62
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:07,994
What I understand is it's fairly low on
the company's priority list right now.

63
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:10,914
You tell them to sort that out, you
know what I'm talking about?

64
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:14,000
That's not...
I've only got two weeks,

65
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:17,629
but it's not fair
to whoever is coming up here next.

66
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:21,216
I will, Sam. Do you want me to finish
cutting your hair later?

67
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,593
No, come on,
let's finish this.

68
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,847
Another one
of those headaches.

69
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,559
Gerty, can you give me something for it?

70
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,625
Message received
from your wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.

71
00:08:57,962 --> 00:08:59,045
Fuck.

72
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:08,471
Hi, Sam. It's me.

73
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:12,559
I got your last message.

74
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:15,770
It was really good
to hear your voice.

75
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,438
I miss you, too.

76
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:21,317
I know you're really lonely up there,

77
00:09:21,652 --> 00:09:23,611
but I think,

78
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,990
in a lot of ways,
it's been really good for you.

79
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:29,284
For both of us.

80
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:33,162
God, I hope you don't
mind me saying that.

81
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,001
I'm proud of you.

82
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:41,671
Someone's got something to say.

83
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:46,884
What did you want to
say to Daddy, baby?

84
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,762
Say, astronaut.

85
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,223
Astronaut, Daddy.

86
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:58,104
Who's an astronaut?
Daddy's an astronaut. Say it really loudly.

87
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:00,231
Daddy's an astronaut.

88
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,276
Clever girl. Wave.

89
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,861
Give Daddy a wave.

90
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:08,156
Kathy, could you...

91
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,703
I can't believe you're
going to be home soon.

92
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,914
It's her birthday next month.

93
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:20,084
And I was thinking
about maybe a playhouse for the garden.

94
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,670
- Gerty.
- We could pick it out together.

95
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,547
Sam.

96
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:29,636
I love you.

97
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,803
And I miss you.

98
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:32,263
I miss you.

99
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:35,850
And I can't wait to see you.

100
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:39,395
Okay, sweetheart. Bye.

101
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:06,964
Hi, Doug.

102
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:11,344
You're really full of yourself,
aren't you, Doug?

103
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,221
Kathryn.

104
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,324
Not good.

105
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:35,618
What about Dumbo?

106
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:38,413
Doesn't he object to your...

107
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,040
Yes. Darrin objects.

108
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,168
But it's a special
occasion because of the morning light.

109
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:22,623
Ah, fuck! God damn it!

110
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,751
Fuck!

111
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:29,672
It's gotta smart, doesn't it, Gerty?

112
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:32,675
Sam, can I ask how it happened?

113
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,180
I told you, I saw something on TV and
I spilled boiling water on my hand.

114
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:39,599
You saw something on TV?

115
00:12:39,683 --> 00:12:42,101
Yeah, I saw something
on TV that distracted me.

116
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:44,353
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?

117
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:47,356
Sam, you said
it was the TV that distracted you.

118
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:49,776
But when I came in,
the TV wasn't on.

119
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,278
Perhaps you were imagining things.

120
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:57,533
Yeah, you think too much, pal.

121
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:02,663
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.

122
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:46,207
I am the one and only

123
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:50,503
Oh, yeah!

124
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,760
Okay. Shut up.

125
00:14:31,795 --> 00:14:33,296
Morning, Gerty.

126
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,590
Morning, Sam.
How are you today?

127
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,466
Fine. Fine.

128
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:40,511
- How's the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore.

129
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:42,555
Little sore. It's okay.

130
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:46,225
What's for breakfast?

131
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,768
The usual.

132
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:54,775
Two weeks to go, Sam.

133
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,819
Two weeks to go, buddy.

134
00:14:57,487 --> 00:15:00,323
Would you like
some hot sauce on your beans?

135
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,492
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.

136
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:07,538
But thank you. Thank you, Gerty.

137
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:09,373
You're welcome, Sam.

138
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,584
8:19 Pacific Time.

139
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:16,339
Readouts are as follows.
Matthew, 9.8 miles.

140
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:19,634
Mark is nine...

141
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,844
Hey, Gerty...

142
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,471
Rock and roll.

143
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:36,943
Mark...

144
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:39,946
Mark's 11 miles on the button.

145
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,326
Luke's a little twitchy today.

146
00:15:58,382 --> 00:16:00,299
Hey, Gerty,

147
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:02,718
looks like
we got a live one out on Matthew.

148
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,637
I'm gonna go out in a few minutes.

149
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:07,431
I'm just going to finish my coffee, okay?

150
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:08,849
Okay, Sam.

151
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:16,691
Searching for long-range comms.

152
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:22,238
Signal failure on long-range comms.

153
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,351
Danger. Atmospheric compromise.

154
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:08,385
Where am...

155
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,429
Where am I?

156
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:14,642
Sam, you're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.

157
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,936
Do you remember what happened?

158
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,027
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.

159
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,572
Do you remember me?

160
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,827
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.

161
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,204
That's good. That's very good.

162
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,665
It's nice to see you awake again.

163
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,584
I'd like to keep you
under observation here in the Infirmary

164
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:43,170
for a few days and run some tests.

165
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,258
How long have I been out?

166
00:18:47,717 --> 00:18:50,553
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.

167
00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:51,887
Okay, bro.

168
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:55,266
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.

169
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:35,598
Hello?

170
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:04,418
...good working order, but we only have
two working Harvesters now.

171
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:05,794
Come on, come on.

172
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:07,963
Yeah, well, that's no surprise,
but it's not good enough.

173
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:10,716
Gerty, we're gonna
have to find a way to ramp up production

174
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,593
- on Mark and John.
- I know.

175
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:16,680
This is incredible. How do you manage
to fucking break a Harvester

176
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:18,891
and an employee, all in the same day?

177
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:22,144
These were extraordinary
circumstances, as you know.

178
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:24,730
Gerty, what's the status on Harvester 3?

179
00:20:24,814 --> 00:20:26,482
How are the repairs going ahead?

180
00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:29,902
- Sam. You're out of bed.
- Yeah.

181
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,697
I wanted to stretch my legs. Who was that?

182
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:39,078
We've been having
some problems with the Lunar Sat,

183
00:20:39,162 --> 00:20:41,288
and our live feed seems to be down.

184
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,916
I was recording
a video message for Central,

185
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,252
updating them on your progress.

186
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:48,879
Sam, you need to stay in bed.

187
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:51,173
You're not ready to walk around yet.

188
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:53,842
All right.

189
00:20:54,177 --> 00:20:57,179
Could you give me
my sunglasses? It's really bright in here.

190
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:00,266
Give me my...

191
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,601
Give me all my stuff, you know.

192
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:05,020
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.

193
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:08,148
- Well, bring it in here.
- Certainly.

194
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,453
Excellent, Sam.

195
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,291
What...

196
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:27,751
When can I get out of here, Gerty?

197
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:30,713
Sam, you may have
suffered from brain damage in the crash.

198
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:34,758
This would explain your slight memory loss
and logic impairment.

199
00:21:37,053 --> 00:21:39,513
So, what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?

200
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:42,057
Central has asked me to
slow down the Harvesters

201
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:45,311
to ensure you have time
to recuperate and get your strength back.

202
00:21:45,395 --> 00:21:48,480
That's terrific. It's fantastic.

203
00:21:48,565 --> 00:21:50,899
You can return to
the sleeping quarters tomorrow,

204
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:52,526
but it will still be a few more days

205
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,363
before you can resume
anything like a normal work schedule.

206
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,659
- Let's try another test.
- I don't want to try another test.

207
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:02,119
Please, Sam.

208
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:31,857
Hey, Gerty.

209
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,820
You know about this?

210
00:22:37,614 --> 00:22:40,949
Matthew's got
no velocity readout. He's completely still.

211
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,451
He must have stalled.

212
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:43,619
Well, he's obviously stalled.

213
00:22:43,703 --> 00:22:45,621
Don't you think
we should tell Central?

214
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:48,207
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.

215
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,334
I'll pass on your message.

216
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,836
Message received
from Earth via Jupiter link.

217
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,337
Sam, we appreciate the offer,

218
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:37,589
but you concentrate on feeling better.

219
00:23:37,674 --> 00:23:40,926
Hey, we don't want you to take
any unnecessary risks.

220
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,887
- You're too important to us.
- You're to stay put.

221
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:45,222
That is an order.

222
00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:47,099
It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

223
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:48,976
And what we're
going to do is send a rescue unit

224
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,187
to tend to the stalled Harvester
and get the base back on its feet.

225
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:54,189
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...

226
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:55,983
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?

227
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:59,611
Sam, I'm under strict orders
not to let you outside.

228
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:02,406
I don't appreciate that.

229
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,367
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.

230
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:44,907
Gerty!

231
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:52,706
Gerty! Gerty, come here!

232
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,000
What happened?

233
00:24:55,084 --> 00:24:56,960
I don't know. Meteorites.

234
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:58,712
There have been
no meteorites, Sam.

235
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:00,589
Micro-meteorites maybe, I don't know.

236
00:25:00,673 --> 00:25:02,966
Either way,
there might be damage to the exterior shell.

237
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:05,844
I think you'd better... You'd better let me
go outside and take a look.

238
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:08,055
There is no damage
to the exterior shell.

239
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,349
Well, it's not that
I don't believe you, Gerty,

240
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:12,184
but I mean, you know,
this thing is springing leaks

241
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:13,727
like an Acme fire hose.

242
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:16,146
You need to let me
go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.

243
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:18,607
I can't let you go outside, Sam.

244
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:21,318
Gerty, if you don't
let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.

245
00:25:21,402 --> 00:25:23,612
I'm not permitted
to let you go outside.

246
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:27,157
Just let... We'll keep it
between you and me. Okay, pal?

247
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,410
This thing
is springing gas, let's go. Come on.

248
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,454
Just to check the exterior shell.

249
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:34,456
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, Sam.

250
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:35,874
Thank you.

251
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:51,306
Gerty.

252
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:36,101
Searching for long-range comms.

253
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,231
Signal failure
on long-range comms.

254
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,979
Gerty! Gerty!

255
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,821
I found him outside.

256
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:56,491
By the stalled Harvester.

257
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:58,660
Who is he? Who is he?

258
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:00,871
We need to get him to the Infirmary.

259
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:04,332
You tell...
You tell me who that is.

260
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:06,668
You tell me who that is!

261
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:08,086
Sam Bell.

262
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:11,256
We need to get him
to the Infirmary immediately.

263
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,229
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?

264
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,529
Where... Where am I?

265
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:36,239
The Infirmary.

266
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:38,867
You had an accident out
by one of the Harvesters.

267
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:40,869
- Do you remember?
- I'm...

268
00:29:42,705 --> 00:29:44,080
I'm thirsty.

269
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:47,000
I could get you some water.

270
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:56,051
I saw someone out there, Gerty.

271
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:01,890
I saw someone out there.

272
00:30:03,142 --> 00:30:05,644
Sam, you suffered
a slight concussion in the crash

273
00:30:05,728 --> 00:30:07,813
and have incurred
minor injuries.

274
00:30:07,897 --> 00:30:10,524
But all in all,
the prognosis is good.

275
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,903
I'm happy to see you again.

276
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:41,137
- Gerty.
- Yes, Sam.

277
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,643
Is there someone in the room with us?

278
00:30:50,898 --> 00:30:52,732
Sam, get some sleep.

279
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,777
You're very tired.

280
00:31:20,094 --> 00:31:25,265
Spoke to Thompson today. Now that
you're up there, he's promising the world.

281
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,649
I think it was the right thing.

282
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:37,485
But...

283
00:31:38,988 --> 00:31:41,114
It's just such a long time.

284
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:46,661
But I suppose there are things...

285
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:51,541
You know, that needed to happen.

286
00:31:53,336 --> 00:31:55,545
I... I need time to think.

287
00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:05,180
Listen, Sam,

288
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:13,021
be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.

289
00:32:43,844 --> 00:32:45,178
Gerty...

290
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:49,391
Gerty, what the... What...
What the hell's going on?

291
00:32:50,351 --> 00:32:52,769
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?

292
00:32:52,853 --> 00:32:55,397
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?

293
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:57,607
Sam, you're out of bed.

294
00:32:57,692 --> 00:32:58,858
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.

295
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:02,153
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?

296
00:33:02,238 --> 00:33:03,571
Sam Bell.

297
00:33:03,656 --> 00:33:05,740
Come on, come on, come on.

298
00:33:06,075 --> 00:33:07,742
You are Sam Bell.

299
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:11,913
Sam, what is it?

300
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:14,374
It might help to talk about it.

301
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:17,293
Gerty, I don't understand
what's happening.

302
00:33:17,586 --> 00:33:20,005
I'm losing my mind.

303
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:22,048
We could run some tests.

304
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:24,592
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.

305
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,178
They don't know you were recovered alive
from the accident...

306
00:33:27,263 --> 00:33:29,514
Recovered alive?
What do you mean... What are you talk...

307
00:33:29,598 --> 00:33:32,142
Why didn't you report it
to Central? What are you talking about?

308
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:34,436
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.

309
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:36,604
Are you hungry?

310
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:15,727
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...

311
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:22,984
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two
weeks, two weeks, two weeks...

312
00:34:48,302 --> 00:34:49,761
Just getting my slippers.

313
00:34:49,845 --> 00:34:52,263
- I'm using them. I'm using them.
- No. What?

314
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,474
These are mine.
These are mine.

315
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,862
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.

316
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:11,032
I'm Sam Bell, too.

317
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,159
What?

318
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,994
We've got that going for us.

319
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,289
Why...

320
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,880
How long have you...

321
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:27,674
What?

322
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,551
How long have you been here?

323
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:31,386
About a week.

324
00:35:32,221 --> 00:35:33,805
So, how you doing?

325
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:35,807
- What?
- How are you doing?

326
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,145
How am I... How am I doing?

327
00:35:42,606 --> 00:35:44,607
How do you think I'm doing?

328
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,322
Good job.

329
00:35:55,077 --> 00:35:58,872
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the Harvesters?

330
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:02,542
Harvesters are fine.

331
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,252
It's affected them.

332
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:06,963
Here, talking to a clone,
that's slightly troubling.

333
00:36:07,673 --> 00:36:13,094
I'm not a clone.

334
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:21,060
You're the clone.

335
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:24,731
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.

336
00:36:32,615 --> 00:36:36,910
Hey. Hey, Ridley,
you're not looking too good.

337
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:39,370
Butt out of this.

338
00:36:39,455 --> 00:36:42,123
Davey, I'm talking
to Ridley. How you doing, pal?

339
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:46,586
Hey, I think Kathryn
likes you. I think she likes you, pal.

340
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:49,380
You're not looking too good, my friend.

341
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:51,049
Sorry you're not feeling too well.

342
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:52,425
You talking to yourself?

343
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:55,345
- I'll just get you all fixed up.
- How long have you been here?

344
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,434
Oh, I guess about three years.
Almost three years.

345
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:07,148
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you.

346
00:37:08,943 --> 00:37:11,027
I wanted to thank you for...

347
00:37:12,154 --> 00:37:14,614
If it wasn't for you,

348
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,408
I guess I'd still be
in that crashed rover.

349
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:19,619
You saved my life and...

350
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:25,500
Hey, I know this is weird, you know.

351
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:29,545
I'm real lonely, you know...

352
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:33,258
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?

353
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:41,891
Maybe later.

354
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,732
What are you looking at?

355
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:52,443
You look just like me. It's incredible.

356
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:55,863
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?

357
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,493
We look like each other,
I guess. Hey, you know...

358
00:38:03,747 --> 00:38:06,124
It's weird for me, too, you know.

359
00:38:10,713 --> 00:38:11,879
Fuck.

360
00:38:12,715 --> 00:38:13,840
Hey.

361
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,594
Hey, you wanna play some Ping-Pong?

362
00:38:20,556 --> 00:38:21,723
No.

363
00:38:22,182 --> 00:38:24,892
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.

364
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:31,399
- What's the score?
-2-18.

365
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:32,608
Okay.

366
00:38:33,235 --> 00:38:35,028
Do you want me
to show you how to hold that?

367
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,280
No. No, I...

368
00:38:37,364 --> 00:38:40,158
I don't need you to show me how to hold it.

369
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:45,163
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

370
00:38:46,707 --> 00:38:49,709
- Should we, uh... Should we play?
- Yeah.

371
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:57,133
God! Shit!

372
00:38:57,885 --> 00:39:01,095
-19-2.
- Yeah.

373
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:05,266
Do you want a stick of gum?

374
00:39:08,354 --> 00:39:11,647
You know, we could
approach this in a different way.

375
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:14,776
Remember when we went
to flight school...

376
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,110
What are you doing?

377
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:19,197
I'm fixing the net.
It's very Zen, Ping-Pong.

378
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:20,615
You have to just relax.

379
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,837
How long did it take you to do that?

380
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,632
Well, I don't remember doing all of it.

381
00:39:37,716 --> 00:39:42,136
I remember
doing the church, and the Salvation Army,

382
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:44,555
and a few of the people.

383
00:39:44,973 --> 00:39:47,850
My mind's been acting kind of weird lately.

384
00:39:50,813 --> 00:39:53,731
That's Fairfield, right?

385
00:39:54,274 --> 00:39:56,150
There's the Town Hall.

386
00:39:57,152 --> 00:40:00,446
Fairfield? Of course,
you know about Fairfield.

387
00:40:04,243 --> 00:40:06,994
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.

388
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:13,084
Do you know Tess?

389
00:40:20,843 --> 00:40:22,427
Yeah. I know Tess.

390
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:27,265
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?

391
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:29,767
I had a... We had a girl.

392
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:33,312
Eve.

393
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:39,902
Isn't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.

394
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:42,447
She's our little monkey.

395
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:45,491
High-five.

396
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,375
She might be the milkman's,
but she's beautiful.

397
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:59,464
Sam, a new message
has arrived from Earth.

398
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:01,466
Oh, shit.

399
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,682
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?

400
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:11,809
You feeling better?
You have enough rest?

401
00:41:11,894 --> 00:41:15,146
Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.

402
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,149
Well, enjoy it while
it lasts. We've got some good news.

403
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:20,234
The Jupiter Program
had to be put on hiatus,

404
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,153
so we got a few pairs
of hands for you.

405
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:25,698
So, what we've managed to do is secure you
a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.

406
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:27,492
Rescue Unit Eliza.

407
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:30,828
Now, Eliza has been stationed on Goliath 19
for the last two months.

408
00:41:30,913 --> 00:41:33,915
Now we expect them
to reach you in approximately 14 hours.

409
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:35,500
So commence to jump forjoy.

410
00:41:35,584 --> 00:41:37,376
You're about to be back in work.

411
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,755
In the meantime,
hang in there. Rest up.

412
00:41:41,173 --> 00:41:42,757
You hang in there, Sam. Over and out.

413
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:45,176
They're sending a Rescue Unit?

414
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,386
Why? Why are they
sending a Rescue Unit?

415
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,765
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.

416
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:53,893
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.

417
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:56,270
What?

418
00:41:56,396 --> 00:41:58,022
Is that what you really think?

419
00:41:58,106 --> 00:42:01,943
Yeah.
I've got a contract. I'm going home.

420
00:42:02,778 --> 00:42:04,862
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.

421
00:42:04,947 --> 00:42:07,740
- Hey, I'm going home.
- You're not going anywhere.

422
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:09,492
You know, you've been
up here too long, man.

423
00:42:09,576 --> 00:42:10,618
You've lost your marbles.

424
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:14,121
What, do you think Tess is back home,
waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?

425
00:42:14,206 --> 00:42:17,208
What about the original Sam? Huh?

426
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:19,460
I'm the original Sam!

427
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:21,045
I'm Sam fucking Bell!

428
00:42:21,129 --> 00:42:24,257
- Hey, hey. Whoa.
- Me! Me!

429
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,553
Gerty, am I a clone?

430
00:42:30,973 --> 00:42:32,515
Are you hungry?

431
00:42:37,896 --> 00:42:39,188
Hey, hey.

432
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,526
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.

433
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,111
I'm in the same boat, asshole.

434
00:42:50,784 --> 00:42:53,703
- Listen. What about the other clones?
- What?

435
00:42:53,787 --> 00:42:55,746
We might not be
the first two to be woken up.

436
00:42:55,831 --> 00:42:58,457
You said that model had
already been started when you got here.

437
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,126
Well, who started it?

438
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,670
There might be others
up here right now.

439
00:43:03,505 --> 00:43:07,425
Think about it. How did I get up here
so quickly after your crash?

440
00:43:07,509 --> 00:43:10,344
- I don't want to talk about it.
- They didn't ship me in from Central.

441
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:13,639
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.

442
00:43:15,142 --> 00:43:16,142
I don't know what you're smoking.

443
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,477
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.

444
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,104
Impossible.

445
00:43:20,188 --> 00:43:22,023
I bet there's some
kind of secret room.

446
00:43:22,107 --> 00:43:23,232
Secret room?

447
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,735
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?

448
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:28,279
You're the one
who's lost your marbles.

449
00:43:28,363 --> 00:43:30,531
I've been here for three years, man.

450
00:43:30,616 --> 00:43:32,074
I know every inch of this base.

451
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:35,620
I know how many... How much dirt's
between those wall panels over there.

452
00:43:35,704 --> 00:43:37,538
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?

453
00:43:37,623 --> 00:43:40,291
Look, it's a company, right?

454
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:42,543
They have investors.
They have shareholders.

455
00:43:42,628 --> 00:43:44,295
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?

456
00:43:44,379 --> 00:43:46,339
Spending time and money
training new personnel,

457
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:49,383
or you just have
a couple of spares here to do the job.

458
00:43:49,468 --> 00:43:51,302
It's the far side of the moon.

459
00:43:51,386 --> 00:43:55,389
The cheap fucks haven't even
fixed the communications satellite yet.

460
00:43:57,225 --> 00:43:58,934
Tess would know.
She would have told me.

461
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:00,728
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.

462
00:44:00,812 --> 00:44:02,980
You really think they give a shit about us?

463
00:44:03,065 --> 00:44:04,857
They're laughing all the way to the bank.

464
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:06,275
Tess would know.
She would have told me...

465
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,902
What do you get off

466
00:44:07,986 --> 00:44:10,738
fucking sitting there,
sulking like a little fucking boy!

467
00:44:10,822 --> 00:44:12,948
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Wake up!

468
00:44:14,701 --> 00:44:18,704
I bet there's some area
that we don't know about.

469
00:44:19,247 --> 00:44:21,123
And I'm gonna find it.

470
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:25,044
Yeah, maybe
you'll find some buried treasure, too.

471
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:00,454
Fuck!

472
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,250
Eliza arrival estimated 13 hours.

473
00:45:05,252 --> 00:45:07,586
You found your secret room?

474
00:45:09,297 --> 00:45:11,215
Just put that anywhere.

475
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,677
Now, that's a good idea. That's...

476
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:15,928
That's where I keep my leprechauns.

477
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:19,181
- Get out of the way.
- What? Why?

478
00:45:19,266 --> 00:45:21,308
I want to look
underneath that model.

479
00:45:21,727 --> 00:45:24,019
You're not touching this model.

480
00:45:24,187 --> 00:45:26,063
Get the fuck out of the way.

481
00:45:26,148 --> 00:45:28,399
Listen, why don't you relax, okay?

482
00:45:28,483 --> 00:45:30,359
Why don't you
take a pill? Bake a cake?

483
00:45:30,444 --> 00:45:32,820
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- You're a tough guy now?

484
00:45:32,904 --> 00:45:34,447
What, are you going to stab me?

485
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,240
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.

486
00:45:36,324 --> 00:45:38,409
I'm a lover. I'm not a fighter.

487
00:45:38,493 --> 00:45:39,702
Put the knife down.

488
00:45:39,786 --> 00:45:40,995
- Hey, hey, just...
- I want to look underneath there.

489
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:42,830
- Put the knife down.
- No. I'm not going to give you the knife.

490
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:44,749
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy 'cause I...

491
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:48,544
- Let go of the knife.
- Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?

492
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:51,297
Just... You let go. Let go of the knife.

493
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:53,340
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.

494
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:56,177
- Don't push me, motherfucker.
- Let go.

495
00:45:56,636 --> 00:45:57,887
Let go.

496
00:46:08,523 --> 00:46:11,650
Fucking told you
to let go of the goddamn knife.

497
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:17,239
Little fucking...

498
00:46:18,366 --> 00:46:20,534
Fucking little girl, man!

499
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:25,790
- God damn it!
- No! No!

500
00:46:28,376 --> 00:46:31,545
God damn it.
What did I tell you?

501
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:42,723
Okay, okay...

502
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,976
You gonna stop?
You gonna stop?

503
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:48,395
Okay, okay.

504
00:46:50,398 --> 00:46:52,191
Jesus! Fuck...

505
00:46:53,568 --> 00:46:55,903
Fuck me. What the fuck?

506
00:46:56,321 --> 00:46:58,030
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.

507
00:46:58,114 --> 00:47:00,282
- My fucking eye, man.
- Let me see.

508
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:03,077
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!

509
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:09,041
That's enough.

510
00:47:21,263 --> 00:47:23,305
Well, appealing...

511
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:27,476
Nice feet, sexy...

512
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,175
Hello, Sam.

513
00:48:02,137 --> 00:48:04,930
- Sam, is everything okay?
- Yeah.

514
00:48:06,558 --> 00:48:11,186
Yeah, we had a fight,
me and the other guy, the other...

515
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:16,025
He's very angry, you know.

516
00:48:16,234 --> 00:48:17,860
Know what he did?

517
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:20,529
He flipped my entire model over.

518
00:48:20,614 --> 00:48:22,281
Know how much work I put into that thing?

519
00:48:22,365 --> 00:48:24,158
Nine hundred and
thirty-eight hours.

520
00:48:24,242 --> 00:48:27,494
Nine hundred and
thirty-eight hours, yeah, exactly.

521
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:30,247
Nine hundred and
thirty-eight hours, really?

522
00:48:30,332 --> 00:48:31,832
Approximately.

523
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,169
He's got a problem.

524
00:48:36,963 --> 00:48:38,756
He scares me, Gerty.

525
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,133
What is it about Sam that scares you?

526
00:48:41,217 --> 00:48:43,177
How he flies off the handle.

527
00:48:43,261 --> 00:48:46,347
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.

528
00:48:49,935 --> 00:48:52,686
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...

529
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,359
She left me.

530
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:01,445
Tess left me, for six months.

531
00:49:01,529 --> 00:49:03,447
She moved back in with her parents.

532
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:04,782
I know.

533
00:49:09,788 --> 00:49:11,914
She gave me a second chance.

534
00:49:12,874 --> 00:49:14,750
I promised her I'd change.

535
00:49:14,834 --> 00:49:16,710
You have changed, Sam.

536
00:49:17,545 --> 00:49:20,881
Hey, Gerty, since
I've been up here, I've sent Tess...

537
00:49:21,424 --> 00:49:23,801
I've sent her over 100 video messages.

538
00:49:23,885 --> 00:49:27,972
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?

539
00:49:28,056 --> 00:49:31,392
Sam, I can only account
for what occurs on the base.

540
00:49:34,229 --> 00:49:36,855
What about the messages she sent to me?

541
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:41,235
Sam, I can only account
for what occurs on the base.

542
00:49:57,919 --> 00:50:01,422
Gerty...

543
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,470
Am I really a clone?

544
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:14,184
When you first
arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.

545
00:50:14,269 --> 00:50:16,103
You woke up in the Infirmary.

546
00:50:16,187 --> 00:50:19,023
You suffered
minor brain damage and memory loss.

547
00:50:19,107 --> 00:50:22,026
I kept you
under observation and ran some tests.

548
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,736
I remember, yeah. I remember that.

549
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,988
Sam, there was no crash.

550
00:50:26,072 --> 00:50:27,489
You were being awakened.

551
00:50:27,574 --> 00:50:29,825
It is standard procedure
for all new clones

552
00:50:29,909 --> 00:50:32,661
to be given tests
to establish mental stability

553
00:50:32,746 --> 00:50:34,288
and general physical health.

554
00:50:34,372 --> 00:50:38,375
Genetic abnormalities
and minor duplication errors in the DNA

555
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,877
can have considerable impact on...

556
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:42,379
What about...
What about Tess? What about Eve?

557
00:50:42,464 --> 00:50:44,673
They are memory implants, Sam.

558
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:48,886
Uploaded, edited memories
of the original Sam Bell.

559
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,949
I am very sorry.

560
00:51:14,496 --> 00:51:17,289
Sam, it's been
several hours since your last meal.

561
00:51:17,373 --> 00:51:19,500
Can I prepare you something?

562
00:52:03,419 --> 00:52:06,880
Rescue arrival estimated 11 hours.

563
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:11,176
Okay, sweetheart?

564
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:14,263
Yeah, I'm staring into space. Get it?

565
00:52:15,348 --> 00:52:16,765
- Funny.
- Hey...

566
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:19,685
Thanks for this. This is good.

567
00:52:19,894 --> 00:52:21,353
This is cozy.

568
00:52:21,437 --> 00:52:23,647
How's the... How's the nose?

569
00:52:23,898 --> 00:52:25,732
Much better, thank you.

570
00:52:27,235 --> 00:52:31,405
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...

571
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,994
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.

572
00:52:37,078 --> 00:52:40,581
No, it's not okay. I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.

573
00:52:40,665 --> 00:52:42,833
I don't know
what's wrong with me. I got a...

574
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:45,085
I got a temper.
I gotta do something about it.

575
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,587
Yes, you do.

576
00:52:50,175 --> 00:52:53,635
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.

577
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,597
Can you turn that off? Listen...

578
00:52:57,307 --> 00:53:00,058
Listen, I wasn't supposed to... I'm...

579
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,731
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn...

580
00:53:07,692 --> 00:53:09,860
Lunar instructed Gerty to...

581
00:53:12,906 --> 00:53:15,782
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...

582
00:53:21,206 --> 00:53:23,457
- Tough guy.
- Listen to me...

583
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:24,750
- You look like a...
- What?

584
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:27,211
- ... radioactive tampon.
- I wasn't supposed to...

585
00:53:27,295 --> 00:53:29,963
Or like a banana with
a yeast infection.

586
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:34,009
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.

587
00:53:34,928 --> 00:53:38,931
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside
the base while you were out there.

588
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:42,392
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened,

589
00:53:42,477 --> 00:53:44,186
I walked in on Gerty talking to Central.

590
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:46,772
He was having a live conversation.

591
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:49,733
- A live conversation?
- Yeah.

592
00:53:49,817 --> 00:53:52,653
How do you know
it was a live conversation?

593
00:53:52,987 --> 00:53:55,739
Because it was
a back and forth exchange.

594
00:53:56,908 --> 00:53:59,743
Communications equipment
was damaged. There was a solar storm.

595
00:53:59,827 --> 00:54:01,745
It was live, man. It was live.

596
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:04,456
That's impossible.
There was a flare. It fried the satellite.

597
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,668
The satellite's fine. They don't want us to
be able to contact Earth.

598
00:54:07,752 --> 00:54:09,419
They lied to us.

599
00:54:09,504 --> 00:54:10,837
They've been lying to us
since the beginning.

600
00:54:10,922 --> 00:54:14,007
They... They've been
lying to us since forever.

601
00:54:14,759 --> 00:54:16,343
If the satellite works,
how are they blocking

602
00:54:16,427 --> 00:54:19,680
the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.

603
00:54:19,764 --> 00:54:23,475
Maybe they're not
blocking the signal from inside the base.

604
00:54:23,977 --> 00:54:25,560
From where then?

605
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:52,796
Searching for long-range comms.

606
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,549
I'm just passing the
last of the Harvesters. Looks like John.

607
00:54:55,633 --> 00:54:57,843
Searching for long-range comms.

608
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,846
How long until you're out
of the base's range?

609
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:05,058
About a minute.
Ninety seconds, tops.

610
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:08,145
- You ever been out this far?
- No.

611
00:55:08,229 --> 00:55:11,440
- Signal failure on long-range comms.
- Never have.

612
00:55:12,817 --> 00:55:21,366
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

613
00:55:34,255 --> 00:55:35,380
You see anything?

614
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:38,967
It would help if
I knew what the hell I was looking for.

615
00:55:40,553 --> 00:55:42,763
Wait a second, I see something.

616
00:55:43,723 --> 00:55:46,224
Approaching Station 3.

617
00:56:28,476 --> 00:56:29,643
Holy shit.

618
00:56:30,144 --> 00:56:32,354
I think I see something, too.

619
00:56:32,563 --> 00:56:35,357
Approaching Station 1.

620
00:56:40,488 --> 00:56:41,822
You see what I see?

621
00:56:41,906 --> 00:56:45,075
Looks like an antenna
or a pylon or something.

622
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:48,787
I think it's the jammer.
I knew it.

623
00:56:48,871 --> 00:56:51,832
This is why we're not
getting the live feed.

624
00:57:11,018 --> 00:57:13,478
Sam? Can you hear me?

625
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:17,399
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I hear you.

626
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:19,526
Yeah.

627
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:24,114
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm gonna head back to the base.

628
00:57:24,198 --> 00:57:25,866
Okay, I'm gonna
stay out here for a little while.

629
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:29,119
I'm gonna see if
there's any more of these things.

630
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,099
Fuck, fuck.

631
00:57:53,728 --> 00:57:57,522
Fuck, fuck. Fuck.

632
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:49,217
Access denied.

633
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:15,660
Password accepted.

634
01:00:22,126 --> 01:00:24,586
Accessing Sam Bell database.

635
01:00:26,505 --> 01:00:27,797
I'm done.

636
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:30,550
Fifteen point...

637
01:00:31,802 --> 01:00:33,928
My hair's falling out.

638
01:00:35,348 --> 01:00:37,182
I'd better start for home...

639
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,768
For the last time, over and out.

640
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,481
The pod is designed to
put you into a deep sleep

641
01:00:44,565 --> 01:00:48,443
for the duration of your
three-day return journey back to Earth.

642
01:00:49,236 --> 01:00:50,570
Safe trip.

643
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:03,708
Fuck.

644
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,088
Here she is.

645
01:01:09,131 --> 01:01:11,383
I'm gonna go and see her soon.

646
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:29,526
Lunar Industries remains
the number one provider

647
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:34,406
of clean energy worldwide
due to the hard work of people like you.

648
01:01:51,173 --> 01:01:54,551
Rescue arrival estimated nine hours.

649
01:02:13,154 --> 01:02:16,281
Lay down, relax, and breathe deeply.

650
01:02:16,949 --> 01:02:20,994
The cryogenic protection pod
is designed to put you into a deep sleep

651
01:02:21,078 --> 01:02:24,789
for the duration of your
three-day return journey back to Earth.

652
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:26,750
As you begin to feel sleepy,

653
01:02:26,834 --> 01:02:29,919
think about
the magnificent job that you've done

654
01:02:30,004 --> 01:02:33,631
and how proud your family are
of what you've accomplished.

655
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:36,509
Lunar Industries remains
the number one provider

656
01:02:36,594 --> 01:02:41,431
of clean energy worldwide
due to the hard work of people like you.

657
01:02:42,016 --> 01:02:45,268
Safe trip,
Annyeonghi gaseyo, and goodbye.

658
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:56,214
Approaching Station 2.

659
01:04:35,796 --> 01:04:38,423
Hey, I saw three more
of those jammers.

660
01:04:40,384 --> 01:04:44,053
I think the base is surrounded.
I printed out the coordinates.

661
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,556
What's wrong with you?

662
01:04:46,974 --> 01:04:48,600
What's going on?

663
01:04:49,602 --> 01:04:51,603
I found your secret room.

664
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:13,499
Who goes first?

665
01:05:14,001 --> 01:05:15,335
I go first.

666
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,268
Jesus Christ,
there's so many of them.

667
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:17,313
Why are there so many of them?

668
01:07:01,775 --> 01:07:04,485
Sam, can I help you with something?

669
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:06,529
Not now, Gerty. I'm okay.

670
01:07:10,784 --> 01:07:12,201
Gerty...

671
01:07:13,078 --> 01:07:16,622
Why did you help me before?
With the password?

672
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:20,001
Doesn't that go against
your programing or something?

673
01:07:20,085 --> 01:07:22,086
Helping you is what I do.

674
01:07:33,307 --> 01:07:36,017
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

675
01:07:37,895 --> 01:07:44,525
Searching for long-range comms.

676
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:56,996
Signal re-established.

677
01:08:16,558 --> 01:08:17,975
Hello?

678
01:08:19,812 --> 01:08:21,604
Is this the Bell residence?

679
01:08:21,688 --> 01:08:23,606
This is the Bell residence.

680
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:26,317
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.

681
01:08:26,401 --> 01:08:28,611
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

682
01:08:29,655 --> 01:08:32,365
I'm sorry.
She passed away some years ago.

683
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,218
Are you sure?

684
01:08:52,636 --> 01:08:55,096
Yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter.

685
01:08:55,722 --> 01:08:57,265
Can I help you?

686
01:09:00,602 --> 01:09:01,727
Eve?

687
01:09:02,312 --> 01:09:05,022
- Yeah?
- Hi. Hi, Eve.

688
01:09:06,316 --> 01:09:08,568
How old... How old are you now?

689
01:09:08,652 --> 01:09:10,069
I'm 15.

690
01:09:10,571 --> 01:09:13,573
- Do I know you?
- Oh, sweetheart.

691
01:09:15,242 --> 01:09:17,535
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?

692
01:09:19,413 --> 01:09:21,080
How did Mommy die?

693
01:09:21,748 --> 01:09:22,915
Dad?

694
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:24,542
Yeah?

695
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:26,419
There's someone asking about Mom.

696
01:09:26,503 --> 01:09:29,088
Who's asking about Mom?

697
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:42,226
That's enough. That's enough.

698
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,609
I want to go home.

699
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:32,735
Eliza arrival estimated in seven hours.

700
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:36,989
Ow, fuck. Shit.

701
01:10:37,074 --> 01:10:39,492
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.

702
01:10:41,495 --> 01:10:43,371
What are you laughing at?

703
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,582
Well, you don't hold it
like you're trying to stab somebody.

704
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:48,834
For God sakes.
Here, give me that.

705
01:10:54,633 --> 01:10:56,926
You gotta hold it
closer to the blade, you see?

706
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:00,054
- Watch what I'm doing.
- Why are you shaking?

707
01:11:00,138 --> 01:11:02,139
You carve out, like that.

708
01:11:17,447 --> 01:11:18,572
That's it.

709
01:11:18,657 --> 01:11:19,949
It's freezing in here.

710
01:11:20,033 --> 01:11:22,368
Well, you're...
You're sitting under the fridge.

711
01:11:22,452 --> 01:11:25,454
What's going on with you?
Are you all right?

712
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:29,375
Yeah, that crew they're sending in, if they...

713
01:11:29,793 --> 01:11:32,295
If they find us awake
at the same time, you know...

714
01:11:32,379 --> 01:11:34,588
They're not gonna let us live.

715
01:11:37,217 --> 01:11:39,010
You know that, right?

716
01:11:41,305 --> 01:11:43,848
You know, their return vehicle is...

717
01:11:46,018 --> 01:11:48,394
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

718
01:11:49,396 --> 01:11:50,896
Are you okay?

719
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:57,403
Maybe you should lay down for a while,
take some tranquilizers or something.

720
01:11:57,487 --> 01:12:00,656
If I take some tranquilizers,
I'll never wake up again.

721
01:12:09,374 --> 01:12:12,209
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

722
01:12:23,347 --> 01:12:24,805
I'm freezing.

723
01:12:36,693 --> 01:12:38,069
Hey, hey...

724
01:12:39,363 --> 01:12:40,446
Hey.

725
01:12:47,621 --> 01:12:49,288
I'm really scared.

726
01:12:55,587 --> 01:12:57,338
Where are you going?

727
01:13:51,351 --> 01:13:52,685
Hello?

728
01:13:54,187 --> 01:13:55,563
Is this the Bell residence?

729
01:13:55,647 --> 01:13:57,565
This is the Bell residence.

730
01:13:57,649 --> 01:14:01,110
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.

731
01:14:01,194 --> 01:14:03,279
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

732
01:14:03,363 --> 01:14:06,115
I'm sorry,
she passed away some years ago.

733
01:14:07,617 --> 01:14:09,243
Are you sure?

734
01:14:09,327 --> 01:14:12,037
Yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter.

735
01:14:12,122 --> 01:14:13,706
Can I help you?

736
01:15:10,764 --> 01:15:12,973
Gerty, I need to talk to you.

737
01:15:13,058 --> 01:15:14,725
Of course, Sam. How can I help?

738
01:15:14,809 --> 01:15:17,937
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.

739
01:15:18,104 --> 01:15:20,147
That hidden room, Gerty.

740
01:15:20,815 --> 01:15:24,276
The lower deck
is out of bounds to awakened clones, Sam.

741
01:15:25,111 --> 01:15:27,571
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.

742
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:31,867
New clones can only be awakened
once a three-year contract is completed.

743
01:15:31,952 --> 01:15:33,452
Gerty, if we don't wake up a new clone,

744
01:15:33,537 --> 01:15:36,038
me and the other Sam
will die, we will be killed.

745
01:15:36,122 --> 01:15:38,624
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

746
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:40,834
Do you want me
and the other Sam to be killed?

747
01:15:40,919 --> 01:15:42,294
That is the last thing I want.

748
01:15:42,379 --> 01:15:44,547
Well, then you have to
wake up a new clone.

749
01:15:44,631 --> 01:15:45,965
Okay, pal?

750
01:15:58,895 --> 01:16:02,773
Eliza arrival estimated in five hours.

751
01:16:03,316 --> 01:16:06,986
I am the one and only

752
01:16:29,134 --> 01:16:30,342
God.

753
01:16:53,658 --> 01:16:58,495
Hey.

754
01:17:03,126 --> 01:17:05,127
What's going on? You okay?

755
01:17:06,963 --> 01:17:08,964
Don't... Don't touch him.

756
01:17:11,009 --> 01:17:12,343
Come here.

757
01:17:14,721 --> 01:17:16,639
He's not conscious yet.

758
01:17:16,723 --> 01:17:18,474
Gerty and I just woke him up.

759
01:17:18,558 --> 01:17:20,392
Why? What's going on?

760
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,770
Come on. Come on outside.

761
01:17:27,317 --> 01:17:28,776
When the rescue unit arrives,

762
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:32,404
they're gonna expect
to find a body in that crashed rover.

763
01:17:33,073 --> 01:17:34,365
That guy?

764
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:38,410
What, are you going to kill him?

765
01:17:38,495 --> 01:17:40,954
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?

766
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:42,623
Zip up your fly.

767
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:47,336
You're burning up.
You sweat like a pig.

768
01:17:49,589 --> 01:17:51,256
Put your hat on.

769
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:54,093
- Put your hat on.
- I'm hot.

770
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:04,603
Hey, if we go through with this,

771
01:18:04,688 --> 01:18:07,106
I'm gonna need your help
hauling him out to the crash site.

772
01:18:07,524 --> 01:18:09,191
What about us?

773
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:12,486
Eliza arrives, finds you
and me as a welcome party...

774
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:14,488
They're not going
to find you and me as a welcome party.

775
01:18:14,572 --> 01:18:16,365
They're gonna find me,
and you're going back to Earth

776
01:18:16,449 --> 01:18:18,242
before they get here.

777
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:19,743
In that helium-3 launcher.

778
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:22,037
I did the math.
You're gonna pull some Gs,

779
01:18:22,122 --> 01:18:24,957
but it should...
It should be fine. You'll be all right.

780
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:26,709
You're going home.

781
01:18:27,627 --> 01:18:29,628
You did your three years.

782
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:33,048
I can't expect you to stick around.

783
01:18:33,967 --> 01:18:35,968
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.

784
01:18:36,052 --> 01:18:39,680
I saw that VP. She's beautiful.

785
01:18:40,306 --> 01:18:43,142
She's gorgeous. We did good.

786
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:45,644
High-five.

787
01:18:55,238 --> 01:18:56,572
Go for it.

788
01:18:58,324 --> 01:19:00,200
You go for it.

789
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:09,251
- You comfy?
- No.

790
01:19:10,003 --> 01:19:11,336
- What?
- No!

791
01:19:17,677 --> 01:19:19,178
What if I have to take a shit?

792
01:19:19,262 --> 01:19:22,347
Just...
You'll have to hold it in, pal.

793
01:19:23,224 --> 01:19:24,767
For three days?

794
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:29,021
That's the way it goes. Need a hand?

795
01:19:30,523 --> 01:19:31,565
No.

796
01:19:32,942 --> 01:19:34,485
Fuck off.

797
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:38,197
All right. No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.

798
01:20:17,654 --> 01:20:21,031
Eliza arrival estimated three hours.

799
01:20:49,602 --> 01:20:51,228
Hey. We need to do this.

800
01:20:51,312 --> 01:20:55,357
We wait too long and
he's gonna be conscious.

801
01:20:56,526 --> 01:20:57,776
Fuck me.

802
01:20:58,653 --> 01:21:00,654
What's going on with you?

803
01:21:01,573 --> 01:21:04,157
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.

804
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:09,162
I don't think I can move my legs.

805
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:11,206
Besides, look at me...

806
01:21:11,291 --> 01:21:15,752
I meet Eve now,
I'd scare the crap out of her.

807
01:21:18,131 --> 01:21:19,506
What are you talking about, man?

808
01:21:19,591 --> 01:21:23,135
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.

809
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:26,680
You're not going to kill anybody.

810
01:21:26,764 --> 01:21:28,557
We can't kill anybody.

811
01:21:28,641 --> 01:21:31,560
You can't.
I know you can't, 'cause I can't.

812
01:21:32,562 --> 01:21:33,812
You go.

813
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:39,443
You're a good guy, Sam.

814
01:21:39,944 --> 01:21:43,947
It was a good plan, you know.
You just picked the wrong guy to go back.

815
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:56,376
You... You sure about this?

816
01:21:59,839 --> 01:22:03,675
Yeah. You should travel, you know.

817
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:06,595
I always wanted to do that.

818
01:22:07,931 --> 01:22:09,848
Amsterdam, or...

819
01:22:10,183 --> 01:22:14,895
Yeah, you know, I was
thinking about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.

820
01:22:15,647 --> 01:22:16,813
Aloha.

821
01:22:18,191 --> 01:22:21,109
Bring me back
a pina colada, all right, bro?

822
01:23:06,739 --> 01:23:07,906
Hey...

823
01:23:08,658 --> 01:23:10,242
Johnny Spaceman.

824
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:15,747
You remember Tess came
in for that interview?

825
01:23:16,165 --> 01:23:18,417
She was so beautiful.

826
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:22,421
She wasn't
the best candidate, but it didn't matter.

827
01:23:23,464 --> 01:23:25,549
I had to give her the job.

828
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:29,094
I wanted to keep her in the country.

829
01:23:30,096 --> 01:23:33,598
- She was going back to Ireland.
- She was going back to Ireland.

830
01:23:35,727 --> 01:23:38,103
You knew you had to take a chance,

831
01:23:38,604 --> 01:23:40,939
so you called her.

832
01:23:41,607 --> 01:23:44,443
You were terrified. You wrote that whole
speech for her answering machine.

833
01:23:44,527 --> 01:23:46,695
But you didn't need it,
'cause she picked up the phone.

834
01:23:46,779 --> 01:23:49,406
She was, like, "Why is he calling me?

835
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:52,868
"The internship's over.
Why's he calling me at home?"

836
01:23:54,454 --> 01:23:59,666
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an
ice cream cone or something dorky like that.

837
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:02,711
She said, "Let's get a drink. "

838
01:24:04,881 --> 01:24:07,090
I said, "Okay. What do you... "

839
01:26:56,802 --> 01:26:58,929
Sam, this is not going to work.

840
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:00,388
What? Why?

841
01:27:00,473 --> 01:27:04,559
I've recorded everything
that has taken place since your awakening.

842
01:27:05,144 --> 01:27:07,187
If anyone were to
check my memory cache,

843
01:27:07,271 --> 01:27:09,981
it would put you in considerable danger.

844
01:27:13,236 --> 01:27:15,237
You could erase my memory banks.

845
01:27:15,321 --> 01:27:18,240
I could reboot myself
once you have departed.

846
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:20,158
Are you okay with that?

847
01:27:20,243 --> 01:27:23,495
I'm here to
keep you safe, Sam. I want to help you.

848
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,343
Eliza arrival estimated 24 minutes.

849
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:42,305
Sam.

850
01:27:48,187 --> 01:27:49,354
Hey.

851
01:27:51,482 --> 01:27:54,651
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot

852
01:27:55,278 --> 01:27:57,279
the moment that I've launched.

853
01:27:57,363 --> 01:27:59,114
I understand, Sam.

854
01:27:59,198 --> 01:28:00,365
Then you should be okay.

855
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:03,994
I hope life on Earth
is everything you remember it to be.

856
01:28:05,913 --> 01:28:07,414
Thanks, Gerty.

857
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:10,417
You gonna be okay?

858
01:28:10,501 --> 01:28:11,584
Of course.

859
01:28:11,669 --> 01:28:13,962
The new Sam and I will be
back to our programing

860
01:28:14,046 --> 01:28:16,464
as soon as I've finished rebooting.

861
01:28:17,508 --> 01:28:20,218
Gerty, we're not programed.

862
01:28:20,886 --> 01:28:22,971
We're people. Understand?

863
01:28:56,088 --> 01:28:59,591
Eliza arrival estimated eight minutes.

864
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:49,307
Fuck!

865
01:30:16,001 --> 01:30:18,461
Air lock pressurization complete.

866
01:30:22,341 --> 01:30:23,633
Sam?

867
01:30:24,844 --> 01:30:26,177
Hey, Sam?

868
01:30:28,514 --> 01:30:32,016
You okay, buddy? Cavalry's here.

869
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:36,690
Where am I?

870
01:30:37,525 --> 01:30:40,940
You're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.

871
01:30:41,025 --> 01:30:42,525
How long have I been out?

872
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:45,530
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?

873
01:31:10,305 --> 01:31:13,515
...made contact. Yeah.

874
01:31:22,985 --> 01:31:24,400
Yeah, Eliza?

875
01:31:24,905 --> 01:31:26,865
He ain't going nowhere.

876
01:31:27,155 --> 01:31:30,285
Bag him up and we'll
get started on repairs to the Harvester.

877
01:31:30,365 --> 01:31:31,745
Dwight, I'm gonna need the...

878
01:32:28,635 --> 01:32:31,805
Lunar Industries stocks
have slipped a further 32%

879
01:32:31,885 --> 01:32:33,180
after accusations...

880
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:39,395
Clone 6, the clone of Sam Bell,

881
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:42,440
has been giving evidence at CAA's
Board of Directors meeting in Seattle...

882
01:32:42,525 --> 01:32:44,150
You know what? He's one of two things.

883
01:32:44,235 --> 01:32:46,150
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.

884
01:32:46,235 --> 01:32:48,610
Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line two.
