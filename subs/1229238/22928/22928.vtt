00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,928
Lacey?

2
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:16,931
No... no, please!

3
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:19,067
Shh.

4
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:20,635
Why did you do this to yourself?

5
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:31,146
I'll just... I'll just take it right off.

6
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:34,751
No!

7
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:46,941
Everybody, this is Margot
performing on the piano.

8
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:49,330
Thank you, thank you.

10
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:33,334
- I'll just talk to the manager.
- Go talk to him, yeah.

11
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,205
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Yep.

12
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:41,309
Hi.

13
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:46,748
Hey.

14
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:51,739
Tim, he knows. Jason knows.

15
00:04:58,461 --> 00:05:00,328
Does he know because you told him?

16
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:02,964
- No. He asked me.
- Well, I didn't tell him.

17
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,166
He asked me if something happened.

18
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:08,027
_

19
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,815
_

20
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:16,844
Just 'cause we're crippled

21
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,347
don't mean we have to take the crumbs.

22
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:25,887
What, you got some secret way

23
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:29,542
we get back up on the chairs now?

24
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:31,759
- New phone?
- Hey.

25
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:33,428
What the heck are you doing here?

26
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,263
You didn't think I'd let
the whole summer go by

27
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:38,066
- without coming home, right?
- Um...

28
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:40,368
I'm, like, your only friend.

29
00:05:40,403 --> 00:05:41,994
Oh, thanks.

30
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,023
This is nice.

31
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:46,773
Yeah, could have been
doing it all summer,

32
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:48,776
but somebody had to go back to school,

33
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:50,011
take more classes.

34
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:51,846
You sure you didn't fall in love

35
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,681
with some married
professor or something?

36
00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:56,751
No, I don't catch feelings. Ever.

37
00:05:56,786 --> 00:06:00,955
You could come back with me, you know?

38
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:05,293
We could get an apartment off campus.

39
00:06:05,328 --> 00:06:07,095
Margot.

40
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,998
Come on, I'm so over my suitemates.

41
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,630
They're really lame.

42
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:13,034
Is it sweetmeats or sweetbreads

43
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:15,153
that's, like, the neck part of the cow?

44
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:17,638
Probably breads, right?
'Cause it's counterintuitive.

45
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,742
It's like the whole
Iceland, Greenland situation.

46
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:23,911
All right, so you're just gonna keep

47
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:27,166
living at home with
your mom in the past.

48
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:29,951
You really don't have to save
me from my life, you know?

49
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:30,944
But thanks.

50
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:36,824
Hey, guess who I'm meeting up with

51
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,059
at Hall Pass later.

52
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:39,761
Am I literally supposed to guess?

53
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:41,863
JT. You should come.

54
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:43,431
Ugh.

55
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:45,566
You know how I feel about activities.

56
00:06:46,903 --> 00:06:48,770
- Hey, Jules.
- Oh, hey.

57
00:06:48,805 --> 00:06:50,171
Where have you been all summer?

58
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:52,306
Margot's been such a recluse lately.

59
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:53,775
Mom!

60
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,084
My flight's at five, so I'm heading out.

61
00:06:57,123 --> 00:06:59,574
Try not to auction yourselves
off online or anything

62
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:01,949
- while I'm away.
- Okay, we'll try.

63
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:06,254
All right, so you're
coming tonight, right?

64
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:08,189
Mm-hmm.

65
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:09,490
Come on.

66
00:07:09,526 --> 00:07:11,926
When was the last
time you legit had fun?

67
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:14,062
When was the last time
that you were touched

68
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:15,363
in a non-platonic way?

69
00:07:15,398 --> 00:07:16,898
I told you, nobody understands me.

70
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:18,866
Eh, yeah, you should
handle this dry spell.

71
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:20,334
You want to start a forest fire?

72
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,303
You could set this
whole neighborhood on...

73
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:26,541
I did not deserve that.

74
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:29,277
Yeah, you did. You did.

75
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:30,788
Oh, my God.

76
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,247
Someone just sent me
this really weird video.

77
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:48,296
Yeah, me too.

78
00:07:48,331 --> 00:07:49,831
Really?

79
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:51,999
Yeah.

80
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:55,069
Should we get in the water?

81
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:57,638
Uh, yes. We should get in the water.

82
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,809
Okay.

83
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,681
Okay, ready?

84
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:25,032
- Hey.
- What's up?

85
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:27,635
- Hey.
- How you been?

86
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,005
Hey, what's all that? What is that?

87
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,373
- Show me.
- Some ink.

88
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:34,041
Okay. All right.

89
00:08:34,077 --> 00:08:36,177
That's my favorite sea
creature, definitely.

90
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:37,945
Good pirate ship, love it.

91
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:39,380
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

92
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:41,616
Hey, JT, stop trying to be cool.

93
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:43,017
We knew you as a child.

94
00:08:43,052 --> 00:08:44,685
We saw you go through puberty, you know?

95
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:46,088
Sorry.

96
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:50,758
Hey, uh, where's, um, you know?

97
00:08:50,793 --> 00:08:52,426
Oh, he had to bail.

98
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:55,997
Who did?

99
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:57,431
Your date.

100
00:08:57,467 --> 00:09:00,301
She told me to bring someone for you.

101
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:06,774
Margot. Margot, wait!

102
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,176
Wait, hey!

103
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:10,144
I didn't want you sitting
at home being grim.

104
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,913
Well, I have a right to be grim.

105
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:15,049
- Yeah, you do, but...
- Yeah.

106
00:09:15,084 --> 00:09:17,079
I get it, I apologize,

107
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,054
and, you know, he couldn't
find anyone anyway, so...

108
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:22,657
Oh, makes me feel great.

109
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:24,859
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sor... no, I'm sorry.

110
00:09:24,894 --> 00:09:27,562
I just... I'm not feeling
it. Can we hang tomorrow?

111
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:29,185
You leaving already?

112
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:33,467
What?

113
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:35,603
I just... I saw you walk in here

114
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:37,371
and take one look at
this place and leave,

115
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:40,308
so I figured you were
kind of a misanthrope.

116
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:43,077
Like me.

117
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:45,413
Okay.

118
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:47,081
So you're... So you're going?

119
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:48,716
Uh, yeah.

120
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,803
Yeah, I'm just really tired.

121
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,954
Um...

122
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:55,790
Well... Well, nice to meet you.

123
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:57,491
I hope you get some sleep.

124
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,660
Night.

125
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,062
Ugh.

126
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:02,863
So, so tired.

127
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,465
All right, well, you should go.

128
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,067
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

129
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:08,102
- At your house.
- Okay.

130
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:13,374
- Jeez.
- Dude.

131
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:15,766
I think a little bit...

132
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,212
He's doing his best.

133
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:26,803
So, uh... you seeing
anyone at the moment or...

134
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,795
Nope, single as a Pringle.

135
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:30,014
You know.

136
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:32,426
So you're a cat person?

137
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:34,095
I like cats. They're smart.

138
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,631
Yeah, but guys with cats are
all like weird loners, you know?

139
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,698
No, sorry.

140
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:39,233
I mean, if you think about it though,

141
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,736
that's kind of my type, I guess.

142
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:49,844
I always have this dream
where I get attacked

143
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,413
by a horde of puppies,
and they start eating me,

144
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:54,515
and they're very cute. It's horrible.

145
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,784
Okay, JT, what are you doing?

146
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:58,286
Just do it like you're...

147
00:10:58,321 --> 00:10:59,987
You know, like you're
moving through water.

148
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:02,657
Instead of just, you know,
poking at the ball and...

149
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,194
No!

150
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,764
JT! What are you doing?

151
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,132
Don't do that.

152
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,601
Yeah, sorry. You're probably right.

153
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:14,935
Too weird.

154
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:17,071
What? Come on, it's fine.

155
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:19,589
Why are you back in town anyway?

156
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:24,211
You ever heard of the No-End House?

157
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:26,681
I have this nightmare where
I'd be at my grandma's house,

158
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:30,117
and I'd be walking down
this, like, long hallway,

159
00:11:30,153 --> 00:11:32,586
and then at the end there'd
be this standing mirror,

160
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:35,690
and there would always be
someone hiding behind it.

161
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:38,392
And I'd wake up so scared every time.

162
00:11:38,428 --> 00:11:41,195
Yo, Margot, show me your phone.

163
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,663
Why?

164
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:47,967
Last time it was in the
U.S. was six years ago,

165
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:49,328
somewhere outside Detroit.

166
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:53,307
Since then it's been in
Eastern Europe, South America.

167
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:54,975
It just shows up.

168
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:56,992
The only advanced warning
is people in the area

169
00:11:56,995 --> 00:12:00,816
start getting these teasers,
texts, a post on your Instagram.

170
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,693
Most people have no idea what it is,

171
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:05,095
but in the past couple of
days, it's been happening here.

172
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,396
This is, like, one in a million.

173
00:12:06,398 --> 00:12:07,531
Yeah, I don't even know where it is.

174
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:08,732
There's no, like, address on it.

175
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,033
Yeah, the address comes later.

176
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:11,502
There'll be a commercial or something.

177
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:12,517
I don't know.

178
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:17,140
Sounds just like a super-bougie
haunted house to me.

179
00:12:17,176 --> 00:12:19,098
It's six rooms,

180
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,945
each is supposed to be
scarier than the last,

181
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:23,413
but it's psychological.

182
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:24,948
Gets in your head.

183
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:27,217
Everybody who goes in
describes it totally different.

184
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:29,453
Most people don't even
make it to the sixth room,

185
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:32,489
and the people who do...

186
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:34,057
never seen again.

187
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:38,795
Definitely not.

188
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:41,064
Yeah, well, you live and learn, right?

189
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,664
You live and learn.

190
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:49,439
I read that the nightmares
that you have as a kid

191
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:51,335
are usually about a fear of change.

192
00:12:53,946 --> 00:12:55,078
Really?

193
00:12:56,637 --> 00:12:58,720
Then mine were foreshadowing.

194
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:04,721
Do you want to talk about it?

195
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:08,191
Mm.

196
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:10,027
I don't really know you.

197
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:14,197
Yeah, I guess that's fair.

198
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,934
Do you remember in, like, second grade,

199
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:19,393
they'd take us into town to the library?

200
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,906
This one day Margot and I
found this book about myths,

201
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:26,710
and there was this
chapter on the succubi,

202
00:13:26,745 --> 00:13:29,484
and all of a sudden

203
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:33,717
my neck and ears got all warm...

204
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:38,121
Because, you know, for whatever reason,

205
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:42,159
that was just... you know,
it was like every urge

206
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:46,830
and every impulse and
every scary adult feeling

207
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:49,166
that I just didn't understand yet.

208
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:50,831
I can see the appeal.

209
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:55,901
Tell me something about yourself.

210
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:01,102
I grew up in foster homes.

211
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:08,085
What was that like?

212
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,899
I just felt different.

213
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,297
You know?

214
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:17,260
Because I was always trying
to blend in, make friends,

215
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:21,740
I met a lot of different
kids, a lot of different homes.

216
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:26,203
People come and go, you know?

217
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:42,367
My dad died.

218
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:50,318
What happened?

219
00:14:50,362 --> 00:14:52,663
He had allergies.

220
00:14:55,134 --> 00:14:57,438
Imagine dying from something so dumb.

221
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,573
Yeah, he was taking
these prescription meds,

222
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:05,676
and then he had a really
bad allergic reaction,

223
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:07,803
and he fucking died.

224
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:14,695
I actually found him.

225
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:18,555
In there.

226
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,125
This hunter often must begin full sprint

227
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:23,827
from a half mile out

228
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:26,229
just to hope to catch a
single member of the herd

229
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:30,734
who got caught flatfooted
just a moment too long.

230
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:33,670
And even with the long lead time,

231
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:35,772
cheetahs can spend up to two miles

232
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:37,240
in full-sprint pursuit

233
00:15:37,276 --> 00:15:41,044
before needing to rethink and regroup.

234
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,379
The TV was still on

235
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:46,583
like he had just fallen
asleep watching it, you know?

236
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:47,884
It was last year,

237
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,014
and I was supposed to be home by ten.

238
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:54,801
I always just think, like,

239
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:57,731
if I had actually just been home by ten,

240
00:15:57,761 --> 00:16:00,277
maybe...

241
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:03,754
Or maybe not.

242
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:23,120
I'm getting chilly.

243
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,426
How you doing? I knew this was my day.

244
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:31,528
What... what do you want?

245
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:33,697
That's an easy question.

246
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:36,233
But I'm in a little bit of a hurry,

247
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:37,734
a little bit of a rush.

248
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,770
You... you're the convict.

249
00:16:39,805 --> 00:16:41,705
I was, but I'm out now.

250
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,340
I'm gonna stay out.

251
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,742
And you're gonna help me.

252
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:47,644
You better get out of here.

253
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,412
My husband will be
back in a few minutes.

254
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:52,215
Now you see, you're off
to a bad start already.

255
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:53,250
Your...

256
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:39,686
Out to get the harvest.

257
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,500
Well, I think it was...
It's an Egyptian invention.

258
00:17:43,535 --> 00:17:45,635
Oh, right.

259
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:50,707
Margot?

260
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:52,204
What's up?

261
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,388
Hey, how was it? You guys have fun?

262
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:20,998
Oh.

263
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:23,514
- Oh. All right.
- It's okay.

264
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:26,417
Okay. Ooh.

265
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:28,519
I heard they use subliminal images

266
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:31,322
and sub-aural sound waves
to make you more vulnerable.

267
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:34,191
Totally messes with you psychologically.

268
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:37,268
Could you simmer down,
JT? It's a haunted house.

269
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,330
They just tricked you
into thinking it's special

270
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:41,165
'cause they didn't invite you.

271
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,767
He wouldn't even tell him, though.

272
00:19:50,797 --> 00:19:53,410
- No way.
- That's crazy.

273
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:54,812
Oh.

274
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:56,547
- Okay.
- Here we go.

275
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:02,620
Hey, man. How'd you
hear about this place?

276
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:04,188
Been looking for it.

277
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,113
Come on.

278
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,334
- You're gonna go in for sure?
- Yeah.

279
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:09,410
We heard it's crazy in there.

280
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,138
Boo!

281
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,864
I also heard they spray the
area with a hallucinogen,

282
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,267
so we're all gonna be
tripping by the time we go in.

283
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:18,675
Oh, yeah, it makes perfect sense.

284
00:20:32,752 --> 00:20:35,206
You guys gonna make it
through all the rooms?

285
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:37,188
Hell yeah.

286
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:41,883
Whoa.

287
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:44,006
Wait. Already?

288
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:45,865
Damn, did it eat them?

289
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:50,655
You scare easy?

290
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,085
It depends on the
type of scare, I guess.

291
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,588
I guess we're gonna find out.

292
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:51,210
This isn't very scary.

293
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:57,283
Mitch...

294
00:21:57,318 --> 00:21:59,084
It's you.

295
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,144
- Oh?
- Oh, my God.

296
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:03,322
- Here's you, Tamara.
- Here's me.

297
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:09,128
Oh, my God.

298
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:10,763
I mean, it kind of looks like me, right?

299
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,265
- That's insane.
- I think that's yours.

300
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:25,878
That's crazy.

301
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:35,821
That's weird, my phone's freezing.

302
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,823
Mine too.

303
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,004
So wait, how did they do this so fast?

304
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,907
They must watch us while we're in line.

305
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:57,853
Use some kind of 3-D printer

306
00:22:57,884 --> 00:23:00,279
and software that translates our image.

307
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:03,215
Fucking wow, dude, this is brilliant.

308
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:11,490
I don't like this.

309
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:13,645
There should be an exit
light. Where's the exit light?

310
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:15,294
- Where's your hand?
- What?

311
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:18,697
It reminds me of that Douglas
Gordon installation, you know?

312
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:54,900
Mine's fine.

313
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:02,374
I want to know how they did that.

314
00:24:09,653 --> 00:24:12,245
_

315
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:32,971
You know what? No, forget it, I'm out.

316
00:25:21,474 --> 00:25:23,541
Don't smirk like that.

317
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:38,589
They must have permits for this place.

318
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,658
I mean, the city must
know about it, right?

319
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:41,993
Yeah.

320
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:44,996
There are no windows.

321
00:26:47,227 --> 00:26:49,360
You a cannibal?

322
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,718
You okay?

323
00:28:20,753 --> 00:28:22,486
Margot?

324
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:05,963
Guys, they're just actors.

325
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:07,976
They're actors. Relax.

326
00:29:08,015 --> 00:29:10,268
Yeah. I mean, they've got to be.

327
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:11,602
Right?

328
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:14,438
Yeah, this is amazing.

329
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:17,275
So confrontational.

330
00:29:19,512 --> 00:29:21,145
Margot?

331
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,348
Ready? Next room?

332
00:29:24,384 --> 00:29:26,484
You guys should leave.

333
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,552
What?

334
00:29:28,588 --> 00:29:30,471
Go on, it's not too late.

335
00:29:33,493 --> 00:29:36,193
All right.

336
00:29:36,229 --> 00:29:38,296
You think he was an actor too?

337
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:40,331
Or just some crazy guy.

338
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:41,797
Yeah.

339
00:29:46,272 --> 00:29:48,072
Hey, Margot.

340
00:29:48,107 --> 00:29:53,044
Hey, what... what did
he say to you back there?

341
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:55,724
He said, "Welcome back, Martian."

342
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:01,177
Martian?

343
00:30:04,924 --> 00:30:07,291
Let's go home.

344
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:08,604
Margot.

345
00:30:08,637 --> 00:30:09,917
No, I want to know.

346
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:22,642
_

347
00:32:33,314 --> 00:32:35,681
Margot!

348
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:37,216
Can you hear me?

349
00:32:57,138 --> 00:32:59,439
Margot!

350
00:33:03,511 --> 00:33:05,711
Margot!

351
00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:45,284
And I was supposed to be home by ten,

352
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,787
but I wasn't.

353
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:51,858
I always just think, like,

354
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:56,195
if I had actually just been home by ten,

355
00:33:56,231 --> 00:33:58,731
maybe...

356
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:25,955
_

357
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:55,501
Ha-ha! I win!

358
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:58,203
- I have water in my ears!
- Which one?

359
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,106
Dad, we get it. Don't... stop!

360
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:03,475
Cool. Thanks, guys.

361
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:05,677
- Okay, throw me high.
- Ready, ready?

362
00:36:09,383 --> 00:36:10,883
Hello there.

363
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:14,953
Hello there, Margot. How are you?

364
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:21,427
I better clean up before dinner.

365
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:23,330
What's the first rule of the pool?

366
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:27,166
- Don't go in by myself.
- That's right, that's right.

367
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:29,568
What's the second rule of the pool?

368
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:33,839
Don't run by the pool.

369
00:36:33,874 --> 00:36:36,375
You're so smart!

370

How are you?

No... no, no!

396
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:41,434
I want to go home!

397
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,758
I want to go home!

398
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:50,509
You have to go through

399
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:52,411
to go home.

400
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:58,422
One, two, three.

401
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,496
You really think they
would have left before us?

402
00:39:31,513 --> 00:39:33,313
I don't know.

403
00:39:35,536 --> 00:39:38,570
God, it's almost dawn.
What time did we get here?

404
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:41,606
I don't know how much
time really went by.

405
00:39:43,176 --> 00:39:45,210
Okay.

406
00:39:51,985 --> 00:39:54,019
Are you serious right now?

407
00:40:22,783 --> 00:40:26,918
Hey, um, I know... I don't really ask

408
00:40:26,954 --> 00:40:29,588
because I just figure if
you wanted to bring it up,

409
00:40:29,623 --> 00:40:31,022
you'd bring it up,

410
00:40:31,058 --> 00:40:32,958
um...

411
00:40:32,993 --> 00:40:36,027
and I know it's been more
than a year and everything,

412
00:40:36,055 --> 00:40:39,823
but sometimes I just wonder

413
00:40:39,866 --> 00:40:44,102
how you're doing with everything.

414
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:46,104
How are you doing?

415
00:40:48,224 --> 00:40:49,513
I'm okay.

416
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:06,858
You wanna just crash here?

417
00:41:06,893 --> 00:41:09,694
Oh, yeah, I got some clothes in my car.

418
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,231
Walk of shame backup. Nice.

419
00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:15,200
What shame?

420
00:42:59,172 --> 00:43:02,240
Hey, Martian. How was your night?
