a nuclear launch device.

Two days ago, Sabine Moreau killed
one of our agents in Budapest

of Russian nuclear launch codes.

Wistrom is currently en route to Dubai.

596
00:49:12.165 --> 00:49:15.876
For the launch device to work,
Cobalt needs the activation codes.

597
00:49:16.002 --> 00:49:18.838
He's sending Wistrom
to buy them from Moreau.

613

We lose Hendricks now,
we lose him forever.

00:50:21.234 --> 00:50:22.818
So, what's the play?

615
00:50:22.903 --> 00:50:25.529
Wistrom will take delivery from Moreau
in 36 hours.

616
00:50:25.614 --> 00:50:27.740
Now we cannot let
the launch codes leave the hotel,

617
00:50:27.824 --> 00:50:30.743
but we need Wistrom
to lead us to Hendricks.

618
00:50:30.827 --> 00:50:32.912
He'll only do that if he has the codes.

619

620
00:50:34.498 --> 00:50:36.749

621
00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:39.084
replace the authentic
codes with counterfeits

622
00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:40.961
and follow Wistrom to Hendricks.

623
00:50:41.087 --> 00:50:42.421
Well, that's simple enough.

624
00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:44.715
We snatch the codes,
we gin up some fakes.

625
00:50:44.799 --> 00:50:49.428
Jane, you double Moreau, and sell the
codes to Wistrom and Bob's your uncle.

626
00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:52.932
And how do you propose
we just snatch the codes from Moreau?

627
00:50:53.016 --> 00:50:54.099
We take her out.

628
00:50:56.186 --> 00:50:58.938

But, you know, discreetly.

Wistrom will think
he's arriving at Moreau's suite,

walking into our decoy room.

I wanted to find a way to let them know.

1072
01:26:26.522 --> 01:26:29.483
But, you know, orders are orders,
so I didn't.

1074
01:26:34.405 --> 01:26:38.784
One day, the husband decides
to leave the hotel and go for a run,

1075
01:26:38.868 --> 01:26:42.871
so I follow him,
and I leave two men with the wife.

1076
01:26:44.457 --> 01:26:48.543
When I get back, my guys are
unconscious and the wife is gone.

1077
01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:53.382
Local police found her body
three days later.

1078
01:26:54.467 --> 01:26:56.385
What was left of her, anyway.

That was my last day in the field.

life-or-death situation after that.

1081

1082
01:27:11.275 --> 01:27:12.442
I never saw him again.

1083
01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:16.113

1084
01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:18.949

introduced me to Ethan Hunt.

01:27:22.662 --> 01:27:26.123
No, that's not what happened.
She left him.

BRANDT: Yeah, I heard that one,
too, Benji.

1087
01:27:29.419 --> 01:27:32.379
But, unfortunately, I was there.

1088
01:27:33.756 --> 01:27:37.551
Just like I was there
when the Secretary got the phone call

1089
01:27:37.635 --> 01:27:41.972
that Ethan was in custody for killing
six Serbian nationals in cold blood.

1090

The next thing I know,

1095
01:27:56.988 --> 01:27:58.947
I'm on a plane to Dubai,

1096
01:28:00.658 --> 01:28:04.077
wondering the whole time, do I tell him?

1097
01:28:06.289 --> 01:28:07.956
How do I tell him?

1098
01:28:10.209 --> 01:28:12.002
That I'm responsible.

1099
01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:15.756
I could have warned him.

1100
01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.841
I should have warned him.

1101
01:28:20.303 --> 01:28:21.762
But I didn't.

1102
01:28:23.473 --> 01:28:24.973
And she died.
