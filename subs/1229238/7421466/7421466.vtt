1
00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.079
Hey, how did you open your cell door?

2
00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:25.747
Hey!

3
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:26.790
What are you doing?

4
00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:28.542
Open sector 2!

5
00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:32.129
How did you get out?

6
00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:35.465
Get back in your cell.

7
00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.760
<i>I told you, get back in your cell!</i>

8
00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:41.346
Let's give you a few friends to play with.

9
00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:56.361
Sorry.

10
00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.494
Send some guards in.

11
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:05.579
I'm trying.

12
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.171
Okay, I'm set.
How's things going down below?

13
00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.089
How do you think? I'm in a sewer.

14
00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.383
The doors won't open! We're locked in!

15
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.051
Sound the alarm!

16
00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:29.770
We've lost control!

17
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:31.480
Captain!

18
00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:48.705
I'm in position.

19
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.874
Move to phase 2.

20
00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.346
<i>What are you doing?
What are you doing?</i>

21
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.265
What's wrong?
What's happening, Benji?

22
00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.975
Oh, god.
He's not going to the extraction point.

23
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.269
Stay focused.
He knows where he's going.

24
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:02.779
No, I'm not. I won't.
I will not open that door.

25
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:06.116
Please go to the extraction point, Ethan.
I know.

26
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.952
I know what this means, but I can't.
I'm not authorized...

27
00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.122
Go to the extraction point, Ethan.

28
00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:13.790
Go to the extraction point!

29
00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.001
Oh, you're just going to wait.

30
00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:18.169
We're going to wait. Great. I can wait.

31
00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:30.307
Okay, fine. Fine! Fine!

32
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:31.850
There.

33
00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:34.561
We'll just screw
the whole thing up on purpose.

34
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.153
Jane? We're going
to have a slight delay.

35
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:04.132
Why do you want to go in there?

36
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:11.640
Bogdan!

37
00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:13.767
Bogdan!

38
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:16.519
Sergei?

39
00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:17.938
Time to go!

40
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:19.522
Now?

41
00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:20.899
Yes, now!

42
00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.197
I don't know what he's doing,
and for some reason, I'm helping him.

43
00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:29.616
As long as he's where he should be
when the song ends.

44
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.914
We have a passenger.

45
00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:03.733
Sergei!

46
00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:15.912
<i>Open all of them!</i>

47
00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.348
Oh god!

48
00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.977
Oh god oh god oh god...

49
00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:42.939
Sergei, please tell me there's more to this plan!

50
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:22.812
Let's go...

51
00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:24.230
Agent hunt?

52
00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:25.315
And you are?

53
00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.067
Agent Carter.

54
00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:28.902
Okay.

55
00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:31.821
Who's your pal?

56
00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:33.073
I'll tell you on the way!

57
00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:38.870
Light the fuse.

58
00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.741
Sergei, what's going on?

59
00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:40.783
It's ok, bogdan.

60
00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.785
I don't mean to bring up
the elephant in the room,

61
00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:44.621
but what's with the big, hairy Russian?

62
00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:47.957
Who, bogdan? He fed me intel. If l left
him there, they would've killed him.

63
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.584
So we're gonna give him his freedom.

64
00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:50.752
Did you call in the sweepers?

65
00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:51.794
On their way.

66
00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:53.630
Good,good.

67
00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:57.717
Benji, how is it you're here?

68
00:11:58.134 --> 00:11:59.844
Oh, I passed the field exam.

69
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.971
Crazy, right?

70
00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.015
Yeah. Crazy.

71
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.725
- DNA test.
- It's me.

72
00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:07.644
It's procedure.
I'm just confirming it's you.

73
00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.604
- You're very thorough.
- Sergei?

74
00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:10.980
Are you not Russian?

75
00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.607
Relax.

76
00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.151
Sweepers approaching! Brooms are out!

77
00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.736
- Roger that.
- Sergei.

78
00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.198
Are you not Sergei?

79
00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.412
You'll be fine.

80
00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:27.747
Bogdan.

81
00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:29.290
I always take care of my friends.

82
00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.334
My friend.

83
00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.092
Messy bringing him along.

84
00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.760
I thought it went rather well.

85
00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.845
Mind telling me what you were doing
in a Russian prison?

86
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:44.806
Mind telling me why you broke me out?

87
00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:48.184
This wasn't a rescue mission?

88
00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.852
Let me put it this way.

89
00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.563
If the secretary wanted me out of there,

90
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:55.692
it must be pretty bad out here.

91
00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:00.488
We were after a file.

92
00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:02.532
We lost it.

93
00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.159
"We"? Who lost it? You?

94
00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:11.874
Agent hanaway.

95
00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:13.584
Where's hanaway?

96
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.014
<i>It was a letter drop.</i>

97
00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.765
<i>Classified file.</i>

98
00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:30.435
<i>It should have been a simple intercept.</i>

99
00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:40.737
<i>We knew which train
the courier was on.</i>

100
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.697
Eta, two minutes on the courier.

101
00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:44.198
<i>But there was one thing we didn't know.</i>

102
00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.492
Bobcat, your train's six minutes out.

103
00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:47.744
<i>Who the courier was.</i>

104
00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.176
It's now or never, bobcat.

105
00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:07.430
The courier delivering the file,
what's his name?

106
00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:09.057
<i>Go ahead. Shoot.</i>

107
00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.059
We are out of time.

108
00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:20.234
I need a name, folks.
I can't track all these people at once.

109
00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:24.906
<i>Marek. Stefanski. For the love of god!</i>

110
00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.032
You got it?

111
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.159
Marek stefanski.

112
00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:31.788
Searching.

113
00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.011
I'll take it from here.

114
00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:58.689
Hey, you all right, buddy?

115
00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.942
<i>Hana way dropped the mark
and grabbed his bag.</i>

116
00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:03.486
Sit down. Catch your breath.

117
00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:08.408
<i>He had the file in his hands.
Easy in, easy out.</i>

118
00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:09.534
File secured.

119
00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:14.163
<i>But we weren't the only ones after it.</i>

120
00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:17.125
Bobcat, someone else
has crashed this party.

121
00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:20.336
I'm not alone.

122
00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:22.463
<i>Local police?</i>

123
00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.715
No. Armed hostiles.

124
00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.892
Hang tight, I'm coming!
Outrigger, back him up.

125
00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:36.853
<i>Negative, outrigger.</i>

126
00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:39.313
<i>Rendezvous southwest corner,
60 seconds.</i>

127
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.444
<i>Hana way's lens cam drew a facial
match and triggered a warning.</i>

128
00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:48.948
<i>But it was too late.</i>

129
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.248
No!

130
00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:03.546
You're going to be okay.

131
00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:08.718
You're so beautiful.

132
00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:13.890
I'm sorry, I... I should have told you.

133
00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.229
<i>It was my op.</i>

134
00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:23.733
<i>I put him in the field.</i>

135
00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:27.612
<i>And she left him
just alive enough for me to see him die.</i>

136
00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:46.422
I'm sorry.

137
00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:50.760
You know her?

138
00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:53.888
That's sabine Moreau. Contract killer.

139
00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:56.599
Works for diamonds.

140
00:16:57.808 --> 00:16:59.101
What was in the file?

141
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.237
Russian nuclear launch codes.

142
00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:20.957
Imf's been looking for an emerging
extremist, code name, cobalt.

143
00:17:20.998 --> 00:17:24.126
He's determined to detonate
a nuclear weapon however he can.

144
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.420
We know Moreau's
worked for him before.

145
00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.631
What else does imf know about him?

146
00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.133
As much as you do now.

147
00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:33.302
But if Moreau has nuclear launch codes,

148
00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:35.972
you can bet cobalt's gone
from a person of interest

149
00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.473
to enemy number one.

150
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.475
We're here.

151
00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:04.333
<i>Agent confirmed.</i>

152
00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:06.502
Why was he in prison?

153
00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:11.299
He disappeared after he and his wife...
You know.

154
00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:15.469
I thought he'd just been transferred.
Put on leave.

155
00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:20.600
There were rumors, though.
Talk of an unsanctioned hit.

156
00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:22.268
<i>Welcome back, Mr. hunt.</i>

157
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:25.646
<i>In your absence,
imf has learned that cobalt is or was</i>

158
00:18:25.688 --> 00:18:28.399
<i>a level-1 nuclear strategist
for Russian intelligence.</i>

159
00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:31.652
<i>Therefore, the only way to uncover
his actual identity</i>

160
00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:33.988
<i>is to infiltrate the kremlin itself.</i>

161
00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:36.490
<i>In order to get past their checkpoints,</i>

162
00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:39.493
<i>you'll be impersonating
general anatoly fedorov.</i>

163
00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:41.537
<i>We believe cobalt
will do everything he can</i>

164
00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.581
<i>to destroy any record of his identity.</i>

165
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.750
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,</i>

166
00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:49.003
<i>is to penetrate the highly-secured
archive inside the kremlin</i>

167
00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.255
<i>and retrieve cobalt's file
before he can destroy it.</i>

168
00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:55.718
<i>New intel suggests cobalt
is already en route, leaving you...</i>

169
00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:58.387
<i>...4 hours 52 minutes...</i>

170
00:18:58.471 --> 00:18:59.764
<i>...to infiltrate.</i>

171
00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:02.558
<i>To save time,
we've chosen your team for you.</i>

172
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.976
<i>Agents Carter and Dunn.</i>

173
00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:10.900
<i>As always, should you or any member
of your team be caught or killed,</i>

174
00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:14.028
<i>the secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.</i>

175
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.572
<i>This message
will self-destruct in five seconds.</i>

176
00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:17.907
<i>Good luck, Ethan.</i>

177
00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.057
What do you got?

178
00:19:47.728 --> 00:19:49.730
We're going into the kremlin.

179
00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.776
I thought you said "the kremlin."

180
00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.655
I thought you said "the kremlin."

181
00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.367
Okay.

182
00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:40.823
This is very exciting.

183
00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:43.784
Being out in the field.

184
00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:45.619
With you, you know.

185
00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:48.289
It's a bit of a dream for me.

186
00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:53.919
Love your disguise, by the way.
You look just like him.

187
00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:58.299
It's a shame we're not wearing masks.
You know, like, full masks.

188
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.802
Everybody gets to
wear a mask but Benji.

189
00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:03.888
Sorry.

190
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:05.765
I'm tense. I babble when I'm nervous.

191
00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:07.808
I'm doing it again. Shut up, Benji.

192
00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:23.407
Okay, seven security guards.

193
00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:26.118
X-ray machines. Cameras.
Metal detectors.

194
00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:28.370
Just what we expected. We can do this.

195
00:21:33.334 --> 00:21:36.670
Releasing in three, two, one.

196
00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:46.514
Game face, game face.
Kremlin game face.

197
00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:51.727
General...

198
00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:53.896
I am major egorov.

199
00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:55.898
Your documents.

200
00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:05.449
You should know your boss.

201
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.268
I can't find you.

202
00:22:38.232 --> 00:22:39.567
Run it again...

203
00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:40.776
...private.

204
00:22:40.818 --> 00:22:42.361
Egorov.

205
00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:55.374
Excuse me, general. I didn't recognize you.

206
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.253
You're going to regret this, egorov.

207
00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:10.139
I think that went quite well.

208
00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:11.307
Just shut it.

209
00:23:11.432 --> 00:23:12.433
Sorry.

210
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:37.851
It's going to work.

211
00:24:39.186 --> 00:24:42.856
I'm sorry, by the way.
About you and Julia.

212
00:24:44.358 --> 00:24:46.193
You know, not working out.

213
00:24:46.527 --> 00:24:49.947
I wanted to say something
before you went away, but...

214
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.407
I liked her, you know.

215
00:24:52.533 --> 00:24:54.201
He's off the phone now.

216
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.794
It's empty-

217
00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:35.339
the nest is empty.

218
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.563
Check in, team leader.

219
00:28:51.772 --> 00:28:52.773
<i>Over.</i>

220
00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.108
<i>Repeat. Check in, team leader.</i>

221
00:28:55.859 --> 00:28:57.611
Have you made it to the archive room?

222
00:28:57.903 --> 00:28:59.571
Captain! The archive room!

223
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:00.822
Run!

224
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.326
Someone is piggybacking our frequency.

225
00:29:05.661 --> 00:29:06.662
<i>Team leader,</i>

226
00:29:06.745 --> 00:29:10.582
awaiting your go-sign.
Standing by to detonate.

227
00:29:10.707 --> 00:29:11.792
Abort.

228
00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:17.130
Rendezvous nine-two.

229
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:38.795
Shut the gate!

230
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:41.673
Quickly!

231
00:32:33.326 --> 00:32:34.995
Our media is no more
truthful than yours,

232
00:32:35.871 --> 00:32:37.330
American.

233
00:32:37.998 --> 00:32:41.668
But we both know
that the real cause of the explosion

234
00:32:42.002 --> 00:32:43.336
was you.

235
00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:50.844
<i>Awaiting your go-sign, team leader.</i>

236
00:32:50.886 --> 00:32:52.888
<i>Standing by to detonate.</i>

237
00:32:53.847 --> 00:32:55.348
The worst part for you,

238
00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:57.434
"team leader,"

239
00:32:58.268 --> 00:33:01.563
is I am the man assigned
to make you suffer for it.

240
00:33:02.022 --> 00:33:04.232
For what you did to my country.

241
00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:09.070
This is a hospital...

242
00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:10.572
Not a night club.

243
00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:12.574
Misha...Help me here...

244
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:14.910
Room twelve.

245
00:33:29.132 --> 00:33:32.844
The doctors say he's lucky to be alive.

246
00:33:36.264 --> 00:33:38.350
Only a mild concussion.

247
00:33:38.517 --> 00:33:40.435
I don't give a damn about his health.

248
00:33:43.104 --> 00:33:46.149
I have questions that need answering.

249
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.611
Be careful!

250
00:33:51.571 --> 00:33:52.906
Prepare a transport.

251
00:33:58.495 --> 00:33:59.496
Check over there!

252
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:42.497
Not a good idea.

253
00:34:43.957 --> 00:34:46.793
It seemed like one a minute ago.

254
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.725
All agents! Hot target heading west!

255
00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:04.204
<i>Consolidated insurance.</i>

256
00:36:04.245 --> 00:36:05.288
<i>How may I help you?</i>

257
00:36:05.372 --> 00:36:09.334
Sat 20. Agent 82-delta-echo
requesting immediate evac.

258
00:36:09.668 --> 00:36:11.961
Rendezvous Alpha 113.

259
00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:14.881
<i>Confirmed. Alpha 113.</i>

260
00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:41.199
<i>Details surrounding
the intricate system of gas lines</i>

261
00:36:41.282 --> 00:36:43.952
<i>that run beneath the square
are still forthcoming,</i>

262
00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:47.038
<i>but the majority of
those lines date back to the Soviet era</i>

263
00:36:47.122 --> 00:36:49.332
<i>and have not been updated in at least...</i>

264
00:36:49.749 --> 00:36:54.713
Anna... Anna... I've been thinking...

265
00:36:55.797 --> 00:36:56.798
It looks like we...

266
00:37:01.469 --> 00:37:03.555
We should leave town
for a couple of days.

267
00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:06.266
Alex, you, me. Vacations.

268
00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:08.601
- Now?
- Tonight.

269
00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:10.562
<i>Why are you speaking in English?</i>

270
00:37:11.354 --> 00:37:12.897
Just“.

271
00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:14.733
Just the three of us.

272
00:37:14.816 --> 00:37:18.570
<i>...may not have been an accident,
but a targeted attack.</i>

273
00:37:19.946 --> 00:37:21.322
<i>Preliminary numbers are just starting...</i>

274
00:37:21.364 --> 00:37:22.699
Where will we go?

275
00:37:22.782 --> 00:37:25.076
<i>...to come in regarding
those wounded in the blast.</i>

276
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.454
<i>We can confirm that 11 tourists...</i>

277
00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:28.580
Leonid?

278
00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:30.081
<i>...their nationalities still unconfirmed,</i>

279
00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:33.501
<i>have been transported
to area hospitals for treatment.</i>

280
00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:37.338
<i>While Russian officials continue
to blame a gas-main break,</i>

281
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:41.760
<i>experts are citing the shape of the blast
area and the size of the debris field</i>

282
00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:44.637
<i>as more consistent
with that of a set explosive,</i>

283
00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:46.681
<i>leading to speculation
that this may have been</i>

284
00:37:46.765 --> 00:37:49.017
<i>an undeclared act of aggression.</i>

285
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.311
<i>Although the defense ministry
is maintaining</i>

286
00:37:51.352 --> 00:37:52.687
<i>that this is strictly an accident...</i>

287
00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:55.482
Anna, pack a bag for Alex.

288
00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:58.151
We're leaving now.

289
00:37:59.569 --> 00:38:00.862
Anya!

290
00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:03.865
Anya!

291
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.712
We have work to do.

292
00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:48.618
Mr. secretary.

293
00:38:52.956 --> 00:38:54.290
I wasn't aware you were in Russia.

294
00:38:54.374 --> 00:38:57.961
I'm not.
Not since a bomb blew up the kremlin.

295
00:39:02.423 --> 00:39:05.134
Yesterday I flew in
to accept the order of friendship

296
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.761
from the Russian prime minister.

297
00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:09.514
Now I'm headed back to Washington

298
00:39:09.597 --> 00:39:12.267
to hand the president my resignation.

299
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:17.647
My chief analyst, William Brandt.

300
00:39:19.274 --> 00:39:20.525
Do you have a pen?

301
00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:21.609
- Pardon me?
- A pen.

302
00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:24.237
Yeah.

303
00:39:26.406 --> 00:39:28.074
Ethan, what happened in the kremlin?

304
00:39:29.492 --> 00:39:30.493
Chief analyst, you say?

305
00:39:30.577 --> 00:39:32.370
If you're implying that
i made a bad call...

306
00:39:32.453 --> 00:39:33.663
European male.

307
00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:37.041
Fifties. About six-foot,
180 pounds. Blue eyes.

308
00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:38.459
Who is he?

309
00:39:40.253 --> 00:39:43.131
A crude drawing,
but by your description,

310
00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:44.632
that could be Kurt Hendricks.

311
00:39:44.674 --> 00:39:48.303
190 IQ. Served in
Swedish special forces.

312
00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:51.306
Professor of physics,
Stockholm university.

313
00:39:51.347 --> 00:39:53.099
Specialist in nuclear endgame theory.

314
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:54.809
Asked to resign...

315
00:39:56.436 --> 00:39:58.104
Well, because he's crazy.

316
00:39:59.105 --> 00:40:00.106
Cobalt.

317
00:40:03.318 --> 00:40:05.403
You have to alert the kremlin
that one of their strategists

318
00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:06.905
has a nuclear launch device

319
00:40:07.322 --> 00:40:10.158
and one of his operatives
has the codes to activate it.

320
00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:11.451
And what makes you say that?

321
00:40:12.702 --> 00:40:13.703
I saw him

322
00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:17.123
<i>leaving the executive armory,
bag in hand.</i>

323
00:40:17.206 --> 00:40:19.500
He set off that explosion
to cover his tracks.

324
00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:21.711
It could be weeks
before the Russians know it's missing.

325
00:40:21.794 --> 00:40:22.921
Unless we tell them.

326
00:40:23.004 --> 00:40:24.547
They won't listen to us.

327
00:40:24.631 --> 00:40:28.593
As far as the Russians are concerned,
we just bombed the kremlin.

328
00:40:29.218 --> 00:40:31.679
The tension between
the United States and Russia

329
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:34.724
hasn't been this high
since the Cuban missile crisis.

330
00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:39.187
And the blame, right or wrong,
points to imf.

331
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.570
The president has initiated
ghost protocol.

332
00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:51.366
The entire imf has been disavowed.

333
00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:56.371
So what happens now?

334
00:40:56.412 --> 00:40:59.749
Now, I've been ordered
to take you back to Washington,

335
00:40:59.832 --> 00:41:02.877
where the dod will label you
as a rogue extremist

336
00:41:03.044 --> 00:41:05.588
and hang the kremlin bombing
on you and your team.

337
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:07.966
Unless,

338
00:41:08.716 --> 00:41:10.301
you were to escape

339
00:41:10.385 --> 00:41:13.596
somewhere between here
and the airport,

340
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.350
having assaulted Mr. Brandt and me.

341
00:41:17.392 --> 00:41:18.393
Sir?

342
00:41:19.394 --> 00:41:20.645
You would then

343
00:41:20.728 --> 00:41:22.730
illegally scrounge
whatever material you could

344
00:41:22.772 --> 00:41:25.358
from a backup supply cache
that I've overlooked.

345
00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.736
The same cache where
your team are waiting for further orders.

346
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.821
Sir, you may want to...

347
00:41:29.904 --> 00:41:34.742
You will then disappear, and this
conversation never having taken place,

348
00:41:34.784 --> 00:41:37.453
your intentions would be unclear.

349
00:41:37.537 --> 00:41:41.332
But if any one of your team
is caught or killed,

350
00:41:41.416 --> 00:41:43.584
they will be branded terrorists,

351
00:41:43.626 --> 00:41:47.130
out to incite global nuclear war.

352
00:41:54.262 --> 00:41:55.346
Your mission,

353
00:41:56.556 --> 00:41:58.683
should you choose to accept it.

354
00:42:03.271 --> 00:42:05.523
Ethan, you were my best man.

355
00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:08.609
And I'm sorry it's come to this,

356
00:42:08.651 --> 00:42:11.154
after all the sacrifices you made.

357
00:42:13.448 --> 00:42:15.616
If we don't meet again,
i just want you to know,

358
00:42:16.868 --> 00:42:18.286
I've always considered you a friend.

359
00:42:20.621 --> 00:42:22.498
Stay down! Drive, drive, drive!

360
00:42:49.192 --> 00:42:50.193
You okay?

361
00:42:50.318 --> 00:42:51.319
Yeah.

362
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:54.614
Take a deep breath. Stay with me.

363
00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:55.948
- Ready?
- Yeah.

364
00:43:20.515 --> 00:43:21.849
What do we do?

365
00:43:23.351 --> 00:43:24.435
Wait here.

366
00:43:26.687 --> 00:43:28.523
Where else am I going to go?

367
00:43:43.663 --> 00:43:45.414
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

368
00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.681
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

369
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:03.683
Hold your fire!

370
00:44:04.559 --> 00:44:05.768
Hold your fire!

371
00:44:06.018 --> 00:44:07.228
Weapons down!

372
00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:10.606
What are you firing at?

373
00:44:32.044 --> 00:44:35.214
Two prisoners escaped from rankow prison today.

374
00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:44.098
And this one?...

375
00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:46.684
What do we know about <i>him?</i>

376
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:51.981
Why would that work?

377
00:44:53.608 --> 00:44:54.817
Why would what work?

378
00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:57.069
The flare on the body,
why would that work?

379
00:44:57.111 --> 00:44:58.279
It did work.

380
00:44:58.362 --> 00:45:00.239
- Yeah, I know, but...
- Hey!

381
00:45:00.281 --> 00:45:04.535
But why? I mean, how did you know
that would draw their fire?

382
00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:06.787
I didn't. I played a hunch.

383
00:45:08.456 --> 00:45:11.792
Okay. All right,
so what was your scenario?

384
00:45:11.876 --> 00:45:14.629
Right, you...
There's a guy being shot at in the water.

385
00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:17.840
All of a sudden, decides to light up
a flare and swim around?

386
00:45:18.966 --> 00:45:21.636
I mean, what did you assume
they'd be thinking?

387
00:45:21.677 --> 00:45:23.429
- Thinking?
- Yeah.

388
00:45:23.471 --> 00:45:26.349
I didn't assume they were thinking.

389
00:45:26.432 --> 00:45:28.434
I assumed they were shooting
at anything that moved.

390
00:45:28.517 --> 00:45:30.937
<i>T. Just gave them a target. Look, these...</i>

391
00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:33.773
These guys aren't
rhodes scholars, you know?

392
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.487
It's really happening, isn't it?

393
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:41.364
Yeah.

394
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:43.991
Okay, you know what that sound is?

395
00:45:44.033 --> 00:45:45.868
That's our ride out of here!

396
00:45:45.952 --> 00:45:49.163
All right, it's a green car. Number 47.

397
00:45:52.375 --> 00:45:53.918
I see green!

398
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:55.586
Okay, let's do it.

399
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.171
Go, go] Go! Go'

400
00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:01.008
all right, 47.

401
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:02.343
I don't see it.

402
00:46:02.385 --> 00:46:03.844
47.

403
00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:05.263
Oh, shit!

404
00:46:11.686 --> 00:46:13.813
This is it. The manifest.

405
00:46:13.854 --> 00:46:15.481
<i>Enter your code.</i>

406
00:46:15.523 --> 00:46:16.524
Pole!

407
00:46:19.527 --> 00:46:20.695
Jeez“.

408
00:46:22.238 --> 00:46:23.739
<i>Press enter.</i>

409
00:46:26.075 --> 00:46:27.451
Retinal scanner!

410
00:46:31.038 --> 00:46:33.291
<i>Retinal scan required.</i>

411
00:46:33.374 --> 00:46:34.709
Watch out!

412
00:46:35.501 --> 00:46:37.545
<i>Retinal scan required.</i>

413
00:46:37.586 --> 00:46:39.213
<i>Agent confirmed.</i>

414
00:46:52.768 --> 00:46:55.563
Ethan? Jeez, I thought you were dead!

415
00:46:55.604 --> 00:46:57.398
- We are.
- Who's this?

416
00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.818
Agents Dunn and Carter.
William Brandt, chief analyst.

417
00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:02.236
Analyst?

418
00:47:07.074 --> 00:47:08.743
<i>Agent confirmed.</i>

419
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.961
<i>How will the world finally end?</i>

420
00:47:20.129 --> 00:47:23.090
<i>It is my job to predict the unthinkable.</i>

421
00:47:24.633 --> 00:47:27.178
<i>To treat the death of billions as a game.</i>

422
00:47:28.804 --> 00:47:32.141
<i>After 20 years of this, I was numb.</i>

423
00:47:32.975 --> 00:47:35.978
<i>Until a new question crossed my mind.</i>

424
00:47:36.937 --> 00:47:39.774
<i>What happens after
the end of the world?</i>

425
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.109
Are you sure your line is secure?

426
00:47:42.151 --> 00:47:43.944
<i>Every two or three million years...</i>

427
00:47:43.986 --> 00:47:47.114
Are you certain your line is secure?

428
00:47:47.156 --> 00:47:51.285
<i>...some natural catastrophe
devastates all life on earth.</i>

429
00:47:51.327 --> 00:47:52.995
<i>But life goes on.</i>

430
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:56.957
<i>And what little remains
is made stronger.</i>

431
00:47:56.999 --> 00:48:01.045
<i>Put simply,
world destruction is an unpleasant,</i>

432
00:48:01.128 --> 00:48:03.506
<i>but necessary part of evolution.</i>

433
00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:08.219
<i>What happens then, I wondered,</i>

434
00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.971
<i>when mankind faces
the next end of the world?</i>

435
00:48:11.013 --> 00:48:14.058
I don't care what you have to do
to get him to Dubai.

436
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:16.644
I'll make it worth his while. Just do it.

437
00:48:16.685 --> 00:48:19.230
<i>I looked to Hiroshima, Nagasaki...</i>

438
00:48:19.313 --> 00:48:20.481
I'll be waiting for your call.

439
00:48:20.523 --> 00:48:23.067
<i>...thriving cities rebuilt from the ashes,</i>

440
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:25.486
<i>monuments to the unimaginable,</i>

441
00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:27.446
<i>dedicated to the concept of peace.</i>

442
00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:32.660
<i>It occurred to me here
that nuclear war might have a place</i>

443
00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:34.245
<i>in the natural order.</i>

444
00:48:34.328 --> 00:48:36.372
<i>But only if it could be controlled.</i>

445
00:48:36.831 --> 00:48:41.043
<i>Only if it touched
every living soul equally.</i>

446
00:48:42.545 --> 00:48:45.631
Imf now believes this man,
Kurt Hendricks,

447
00:48:45.673 --> 00:48:48.676
is the nuclear extremist,
code name cobalt.

448
00:48:48.717 --> 00:48:50.678
Today he was seen leaving the kremlin,

449
00:48:50.719 --> 00:48:53.389
with what is likely
a nuclear launch device.

450
00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:58.853
Two days ago, sabine Moreau killed
one of our agents in Budapest

451
00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:01.647
and relieved him
of Russian nuclear launch codes.

452
00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:06.193
Intel indicates she will check into
the burj hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.

453
00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:09.613
Marius wistrom
is a known operative of cobalt.

454
00:49:09.864 --> 00:49:12.199
Wistrom is currently en route to Dubai.

455
00:49:12.241 --> 00:49:15.995
For the launch device to work,
cobalt needs the activation codes.

456
00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:18.873
He's sending wistrom
to buy them from Moreau.

457
00:49:19.874 --> 00:49:21.375
The secretary

458
00:49:22.918 --> 00:49:24.128
is dead.

459
00:49:29.467 --> 00:49:32.303
The president
has invoked ghost protocol.

460
00:49:33.012 --> 00:49:34.597
We're shut down.

461
00:49:34.722 --> 00:49:38.726
No satellite, safe house,
support, or extraction.

462
00:49:38.767 --> 00:49:41.979
The four of us
and the contents of this car

463
00:49:42.062 --> 00:49:44.732
are all that remain of the imf.

464
00:49:44.773 --> 00:49:49.153
And as of this moment, any action
is unsanctioned. So if you want out,

465
00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:50.571
speak now.

466
00:50:07.087 --> 00:50:08.339
Our mission is Hendricks.

467
00:50:08.714 --> 00:50:10.591
We're all that stands
between him and his goal.

468
00:50:10.633 --> 00:50:11.926
Nothing can be left to chance.

469
00:50:11.967 --> 00:50:14.011
Everyone connected with this man

470
00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:17.348
is considered an asset with valuable
information about our target.

471
00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:18.849
No one can know we're still on line.

472
00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:21.268
We lose Hendricks now,
we lose him forever.

473
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:22.937
So, what's the play?

474
00:50:22.978 --> 00:50:25.606
Wistrom will take delivery from Moreau
in 36 hours.

475
00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:27.858
Now we cannot let
the launch codes leave the hotel,

476
00:50:27.942 --> 00:50:30.819
but we need wistrom
to lead us to Hendricks.

477
00:50:30.903 --> 00:50:33.030
He'll only do that if he has the codes.

478
00:50:33.113 --> 00:50:34.532
Or if he thinks he has them.

479
00:50:34.615 --> 00:50:36.825
Our objective is to intercept the sale,

480
00:50:36.909 --> 00:50:39.203
replace the authentic
codes with counterfeits

481
00:50:39.286 --> 00:50:41.080
and follow wistrom to Hendricks.

482
00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:42.540
Well, that's simple enough.

483
00:50:42.623 --> 00:50:44.792
We snatch the codes,
we gin up some fakes.

484
00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:49.547
Jane, you double Moreau, and sell the
codes to wistrom and Bob's your uncle.

485
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:53.050
And how do you propose
we just snatch the codes from Moreau?

486
00:50:53.133 --> 00:50:54.134
We take her out.

487
00:50:56.303 --> 00:50:59.056
Yeah, we take her out.
But, you know, discreetly.

488
00:50:59.139 --> 00:51:00.307
Discreetly?

489
00:51:00.933 --> 00:51:02.059
Yeah.

490
00:51:03.102 --> 00:51:06.480
Right, she's an asset. Right. I get it.
Sorry. Nothing left to chance.

491
00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:09.066
He said... I'm spitballing.
It's not all gonna be gold.

492
00:51:09.149 --> 00:51:10.818
@ o n 't to u
- all rig ht .

493
00:51:10.859 --> 00:51:11.860
Or Moreau.

494
00:51:14.196 --> 00:51:17.324
She'll answer for hanaway,
but it has to be when I say.

495
00:51:17.366 --> 00:51:19.076
After we hit Hendricks.

496
00:51:25.124 --> 00:51:26.333
Only pack what we need.

497
00:51:26.417 --> 00:51:29.003
Yeah, absolutely. Only pack what we...
You never know.

498
00:51:56.864 --> 00:51:59.325
So even if we can double
wistrom and Moreau,

499
00:52:00.075 --> 00:52:02.202
how do we keep them in separate rooms

500
00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:04.997
while having them think that
they're in the same room?

501
00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:07.041
We give the hotel a facelift.

502
00:52:07.291 --> 00:52:10.044
Wistrom will think
he's arriving at Moreau's suite,

503
00:52:10.085 --> 00:52:12.338
but, really, he'll be
walking into our decoy room.

504
00:52:12.463 --> 00:52:13.964
Where I'll double Moreau.

505
00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:15.591
Downstairs, Benji will double wistrom.

506
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.051
Masks!

507
00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:18.594
And meet with the real Moreau.

508
00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:20.179
And...

509
00:52:20.888 --> 00:52:22.056
What am I doing?

510
00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:25.309
You? You're the helper!

511
00:52:28.228 --> 00:52:29.605
Helper. That's great.

512
00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:34.151
Okay, so to the extent I understand
what you're talking about here...

513
00:52:35.402 --> 00:52:37.821
The burj khalifa,
it's the tallest building in the world,

514
00:52:37.905 --> 00:52:40.240
and you want to alter its infrastructure

515
00:52:40.282 --> 00:52:43.077
with the hopes of convincing
two people that they've

516
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.497
had a meeting,
which actually really never happened.

517
00:52:47.247 --> 00:52:48.248
Right?

518
00:52:56.924 --> 00:52:57.925
Camels.

519
00:53:45.472 --> 00:53:47.641
<i>Eta on dry cleaning.</i>

520
00:53:47.725 --> 00:53:49.226
On my way up-

521
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:54.606
okay, 34 minutes to door knock.

522
00:53:58.444 --> 00:54:00.154
Wow...

523
00:54:01.488 --> 00:54:05.659
Okay, this is a slight wrinkle,
but nothing to worry about.

524
00:54:05.701 --> 00:54:09.037
We're just going to have to go into
the server room from the outside.

525
00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:11.248
What?

526
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:15.043
Well, the firewalls on this building's
server are military grade.

527
00:54:15.127 --> 00:54:17.004
I mean, this would be a cinch

528
00:54:17.045 --> 00:54:18.505
if I could call youssef
back at headquarters,

529
00:54:18.547 --> 00:54:20.549
but youssef doesn't exist anymore,
and neither do we.

530
00:54:20.632 --> 00:54:22.050
I could hack it,
but it would take too long.

531
00:54:22.134 --> 00:54:23.302
Then hardwire in.

532
00:54:23.343 --> 00:54:24.887
And there's four layers
of next-gen security

533
00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:26.263
between us and the server room.

534
00:54:26.346 --> 00:54:28.140
There's no way
we can get to it from inside.

535
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:31.393
If we can't get to the server,
we don't control the elevators,

536
00:54:31.477 --> 00:54:33.353
we don't control the security cameras.

537
00:54:33.437 --> 00:54:35.522
This operation is over
before it even begins.

538
00:54:35.606 --> 00:54:37.608
I'm telling you,
we can get to it from outside.

539
00:54:37.691 --> 00:54:38.692
"We"?

540
00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:41.195
I'm... I'm on the computer.

541
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.032
I'm just...

542
00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:46.450
The helper.

543
00:54:49.787 --> 00:54:51.038
What floor is it on?

544
00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:52.706
130.

545
00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:55.125
130?

546
00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:00.547
- Vent ducts.
- Pressure sensitive.

547
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:01.590
Not enough time.

548
00:55:01.673 --> 00:55:03.133
- Elevator shaft.
- Infrared sensors.

549
00:55:03.217 --> 00:55:04.218
Not enough time.

550
00:55:07.805 --> 00:55:09.556
How am I supposed to do this?

551
00:55:15.687 --> 00:55:17.189
God damn it!

552
00:55:20.692 --> 00:55:22.027
Oh, that's high.

553
00:55:27.574 --> 00:55:31.578
Okay, now remember, it's a rolling off
motion that disengages the bond.

554
00:55:31.662 --> 00:55:33.872
When the meter is blue,
that's full adhesion.

555
00:55:33.914 --> 00:55:36.083
Easy way to remember, blue is glue.

556
00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:37.626
- And when it's red?
- Dead.

557
00:55:37.709 --> 00:55:40.587
Here's your cutter, okay?
And your server interface.

558
00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:43.507
Both going back here. One, two.

559
00:55:43.841 --> 00:55:47.719
Okay, Ethan, the hotel server is
eleven stories up and seven units over.

560
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:49.763
Okay? Comm check.

561
00:55:50.514 --> 00:55:52.015
Yeah. Copy.

562
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.768
So...

563
00:55:58.772 --> 00:56:01.275
It's 26 minutes to door knock.

564
00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:04.486
Yeah.

565
00:56:59.124 --> 00:57:01.293
<i>25 minutes to door knock.</i>

566
00:57:16.308 --> 00:57:17.684
What the hell is that?

567
00:57:33.033 --> 00:57:35.327
<i>Yeah, what the hell is that?</i>

568
00:57:36.828 --> 00:57:38.538
It's a sandstorm.

569
00:57:40.666 --> 00:57:41.750
It's a long way off, Ethan.

570
00:57:41.833 --> 00:57:43.210
<i>Shouldn't be a problem.</i>

571
00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:48.715
<i>24 minutes to door knock.</i>

572
00:57:51.677 --> 00:57:52.803
Where's Ethan?

573
00:57:55.847 --> 00:57:57.224
You've got to be kidding me.

574
00:58:47.065 --> 00:58:50.235
<i>23 minutes to door knock.</i>

575
00:59:08.879 --> 00:59:10.213
<i>I'm at server level.</i>

576
00:59:32.986 --> 00:59:34.321
22 minutes to door knock.

577
00:59:35.572 --> 00:59:38.075
The countdown is not helping.

578
00:59:40.077 --> 00:59:41.078
I'm just saying.

579
01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:12.442
<i>I'm in.</i>

580
01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:13.944
That's great, Ethan.
You're halfway home.

581
01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:23.036
<i>Located server.</i>

582
01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:31.711
Please tell me we're online.

583
01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.046
All right, we're live.

584
01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:37.384
Okay, I now have control of
the elevators and the security cameras.

585
01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:38.468
Time to redecorate.

586
01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:41.471
Okay, you drive.
And look out for wistrom and Moreau.

587
01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:58.572
Moreau is at the elevators
ahead of schedule.

588
01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:00.740
Go.

589
01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:08.081
We can't open this door, can we?

590
01:01:08.123 --> 01:01:09.416
<i>The door? No.</i>

591
01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.334
Ethan, you gotta get down here now.

592
01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:14.212
<i>Ethan!</i>

593
01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.923
<i>Is there a problem? Ethan?</i>

594
01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:25.265
We're not gonna make it.

595
01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:26.308
We have to make it.

596
01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:28.560
Where's Ethan?

597
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.918
Your line's not long enough!

598
01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.753
No shit!

599
01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.426
That was not easy,

600
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:45.178
but I did it.

601
01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:48.807
What'd I miss?

602
01:02:56.064 --> 01:02:59.567
The lens might be a little uncomfortable.

603
01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:02.487
It captures images and transmits them
to the printer in the briefcase.

604
01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.532
All right?

605
01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:08.159
I can't see out of one eye, but I'm fine.

606
01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:09.828
Blink twice to activate the shutter.

607
01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.706
Notice the numbers are in order?

608
01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:17.335
A perfect copy.

609
01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.298
But the numbers are scrambled.

610
01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:23.967
Masks?

611
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.052
60 seconds.
You sure I shouldn't wear a mask?

612
01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:28.346
You know,
'cause I'm not exactly Omar sharif.

613
01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:30.557
I'll play it French.
This is your tracking device.

614
01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.350
- This is what you're tracking.
- The paper clip?

615
01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:33.393
No, it's the paper.

616
01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:36.062
It's in the briefcase. It's coated with
isotopes which give off a unique...

617
01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:37.605
It just means
that you can track the documents

618
01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:38.815
even if they switch briefcases.

619
01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:39.899
Range?

620
01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:40.984
Not that good. It's, like, half a mile.

621
01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:43.236
Safest thing to do would be not let
wistrom out of your sight.

622
01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.738
Is that wistrom?

623
01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:50.160
Who's that with him?

624
01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:52.871
I don't know. We don't have an uplink,
so there's no facial recognition.

625
01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:54.331
Who's that with him?

626
01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:58.376
That's leonid lisenker.
Polish-born cryptographer.

627
01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:00.837
He redesigned Russia's nuclear
security after the cold war.

628
01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:03.506
He's here to authenticate
the launch codes.

629
01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.675
- Yes, he is. We are blown.
- No, we're not blown.

630
01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:07.969
Well, we will be as soon as he sees
the counterfeit launch codes.

631
01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:09.054
We're not blown.

632
01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:10.930
He's in the elevator.

633
01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:12.182
Delay them.

634
01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.318
Benji, how long would it take you
to reprogram the case?

635
01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:25.612
A couple of seconds. What for, though?

636
01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.906
To make an exact copy
of the launch codes.

637
01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.574
- What?
- You can't do that.

638
01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:31.117
- Wistrom's on 22!
- Slow him down.

639
01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.202
I'll do what I can.

640
01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.623
Wait, wait. Ethan, hang on now!

641
01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.083
Hang on. Just a second.

642
01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:41.628
You're talking about handing over active
nuclear launch codes to wistrom?

643
01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:42.796
Yes. Reprogram the case.

644
01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:43.922
Listen... stop!

645
01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:44.964
Just listen to what you're saying.

646
01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:46.841
You're fixating.
You're not thinking clearly.

647
01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:49.969
It's not gonna happen. I won't let it!

648
01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:51.388
33 and climbing!

649
01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:52.639
Brandt, use your head now.

650
01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.474
The mission is not the codes,
the mission is Hendricks.

651
01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:56.976
Then just let it play out.
Give him bad codes. Neutralize him.

652
01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:58.103
You know that won't do it.

653
01:04:58.144 --> 01:05:00.730
Failure to a terrorist
is just a rehearsal for success.

654
01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:02.148
41!

655
01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:04.484
We lose Hendricks today,
he shows up somewhere else tomorrow.

656
01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:05.652
He finds another way.

657
01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.237
With no imf to stop him.

658
01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.489
No. It's now or never.
Now, Brandt, give me the case.

659
01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.783
Nothing can be left to chance.
You said that.

660
01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:12.826
You're the analyst.

661
01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:14.994
Now, tell me there's not another way
for Hendricks to get those codes.

662
01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:16.079
50!

663
01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:18.790
You tell me that this is his only Avenue,
right here, right now, today.

664
01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:21.251
You tell me that, I'll walk away.

665
01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.635
- We go without.
- Without masks?

666
01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:32.011
- Jane needs to go.
- Ethan!

667
01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:33.054
We have no choice.

668
01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.806
Ethan, you'd be walking in
on Moreau unarmed.

669
01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:36.141
Face-first. Literally.

670
01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:37.183
How do we know they've met?

671
01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.269
- How do we know they haven't?
- Doesn't matter!

672
01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:41.938
Damn it.

673
01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:43.523
We have no choice.

674
01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:36.326
Goggles.

675
01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.246
What if they have met?

676
01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:44.667
Come in.

677
01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.788
Which one of you is wistrom?

678
01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:24.207
Which one of you is wistrom?

679
01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.378
Lam.

680
01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.714
I admire your work.

681
01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:48.314
Sit.

682
01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.825
Where are my codes?

683
01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:01.828
Where are my diamonds?

684
01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:04.247
Close by.

685
01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:06.499
You have my payment?

686
01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:08.459
When I see the codes.

687
01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:11.296
Not to worry. Come in!

688
01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.756
I thought we could have tea.

689
01:08:21.097 --> 01:08:23.433
No diamonds, no codes.

690
01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:26.269
No codes, no diamonds.

691
01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:31.232
Kill this one.

692
01:08:31.316 --> 01:08:33.276
We didn't come alone.

693
01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:35.278
That hallway out there is a kill-box.

694
01:08:35.445 --> 01:08:36.779
You know who we work for.

695
01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:39.365
We come back with the codes,
or we don't come back.

696
01:08:41.284 --> 01:08:42.619
How good is your backup?

697
01:08:42.869 --> 01:08:44.287
The best.

698
01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:50.001
<i>I've killed the best.</i>

699
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.629
Do you care for some sugar?

700
01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.635
<i>Enough. Let's get this done.</i>

701
01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:01.387
You want payment, I want guarantees.

702
01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:03.306
When he's authenticated the codes,

703
01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:05.892
I'll make the call
and you get your diamonds.

704
01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.644
That or

705
01:09:08.186 --> 01:09:10.188
we all go home in buckets.

706
01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.650
Nobody leaves this hotel alive.

707
01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:18.363
Get the papers.

708
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:34.504
Is there a problem?

709
01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.506
It's locked.

710
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:44.347
Forgive me. There must be a key.

711
01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:47.183
One moment, huh?

712
01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:49.036
My mistake.
It is a combination, not a key.

713
01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.247
You tell me the numbers.

714
01:10:57.211 --> 01:10:58.212
They're good.

715
01:10:58.504 --> 01:10:59.505
Zero.

716
01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:02.258
Zero.

717
01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.094
Zero.

718
01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.529
On, on, come on.

719
01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:09.242
It was a pleasure doing business with...

720
01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:11.494
Wistrom has the launch codes.
He's on the move.

721
01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:15.498
Hey, I did as you asked. I did.
Now let my family go!

722
01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:17.208
Release leonid's family.

723
01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:18.584
Thank god.

724
01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:20.086
You can thank him in person.

725
01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:38.271
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

726
01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.195
Kill him!

727
01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.038
Moreau's on the move!

728
01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.374
I've got her.

729
01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:00.710
Jane?

730
01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:01.794
<i>She's an asset!</i>

731
01:13:02.003 --> 01:13:03.379
I need her

732
01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:04.463
alive!

733
01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.008
<i>Acknowledge!</i>

734
01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:08.676
Acknowledge!

735
01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:23.566
Ethan, wistrom is in the elevator.
I can't see leonid, though.

736
01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:28.571
Benji, slow him down.
Get me an elevator.

737
01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.168
Find leonid.

738
01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:58.017
Benji, I've got a lock on
but I can't tell.

739
01:13:58.059 --> 01:13:59.727
<i>Is he still in the elevator?</i>

740
01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:02.188
Benji?

741
01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:07.193
Ethan. Over?

742
01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:08.361
Benji.

743
01:14:08.402 --> 01:14:09.445
Benji, I lost...

744
01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:11.113
Ethan, can you hear me?

745
01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:12.698
Ethan, can you hear me? Over.

746
01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:15.034
Jesus!

747
01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:22.416
Sit down!

748
01:14:24.377 --> 01:14:26.045
- Watch her.
- Why me?

749
01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:27.630
Because if I do, I'll kill her.

750
01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:59.745
Hold it, team leader.

751
01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:03.207
Did you really think
i wouldn't catch up with you?

752
01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:05.251
You and I are not enemies.
It was a set-up...

753
01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:08.129
We'll find out your lies soon enough.

754
01:15:08.546 --> 01:15:09.755
Move it!

755
01:15:10.798 --> 01:15:12.383
I'm sorry about this.

756
01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:36.657
Leonid. Benji?

757
01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:38.159
Go for Benji.

758
01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:40.119
I've got leonid by the elevators.
He's been shot.

759
01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.203
What?

760
01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.800
Hey, hey. Stay with me. Stay with me.

761
01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:15.446
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

762
01:16:21.786 --> 01:16:23.412
Jane! No!

763
01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.387
Come on. Come on.

764
01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:21.520
Now, what happened
with Moreau, Jane?

765
01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:22.688
She couldn't help us with Hendricks.

766
01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:24.314
So let's throw her off the building!

767
01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:25.357
I didn't throw her.

768
01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:26.483
Let's throw her off the building!

769
01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:29.027
She was not the mission, Jane!

770
01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:34.032
The mission was to track the file
back to Hendricks, who is in the wind

771
01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:36.285
with nuclear launch codes!

772
01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:39.163
Maybe you didn't notice the gun
she had pointed at me.

773
01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:41.457
Yeah, like you didn't notice
the open window,

774
01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.375
or that we're about a mile up in the air!

775
01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:45.127
It was an instinctive move.

776
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.211
It doesn't matter!

777
01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:48.130
We're talking about a nuclear war.

778
01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.716
The asset is more important than you.

779
01:22:50.757 --> 01:22:53.135
Where do you get off telling me
how well I executed?

780
01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:54.428
We inherited you.

781
01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:57.055
You're just a bureaucrat!

782
01:22:57.097 --> 01:22:59.558
Better have good news for me.
Is he here?

783
01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.894
You think I need you to tell me
what the mission is?

784
01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:04.771
Yeah, I got it. Dunhill lighter.
I'll be there.

785
01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:06.565
And no one will be following me.

786
01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:08.400
Just make sure no one's following you.

787
01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:10.235
And how the hell
did the Russians find us?

788
01:23:10.277 --> 01:23:12.112
- What are you asking me for?
- Because you're communications!

789
01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:13.989
You're in charge of covering our tracks.

790
01:23:14.072 --> 01:23:16.909
You cannot afford to make mistakes
like that now, Benji.

791
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:19.286
You're not a technician anymore.
You're a field agent.

792
01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:21.914
And you're just an "analyst."

793
01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:22.998
Right?

794
01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:25.042
Right?

795
01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:28.378
Who are you really, Brandt?

796
01:23:30.047 --> 01:23:31.924
- What are you asking?
- What am I asking?

797
01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:33.759
Let me see if I can put it another way.

798
01:23:40.891 --> 01:23:45.103
How does an agent with skills like that
end up an analyst?

799
01:23:53.237 --> 01:23:55.447
Well, we all have our secrets.

800
01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:58.534
Don't we, Ethan?

801
01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:06.083
You tell me yours, I'll tell you mine.

802
01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:28.021
I have friends in the region.
Just sit tight.

803
01:24:28.105 --> 01:24:29.648
I'll send someone to get you out of here.

804
01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:30.899
What about Hendricks?
What's the plan?

805
01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:33.694
The plan was for us
to stop him together.

806
01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:36.321
Well, what are you going to do?

807
01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:37.406
Change the plan.

808
01:24:37.489 --> 01:24:39.700
Wait. That's it?

809
01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:42.703
What are you going to do,
go after him alone?

810
01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:47.416
Would you care to explain yourself,
agent Brandt?

811
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:54.316
I was on a protection detail in Croatia.

812
01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:57.486
Shadowing the assets,
husband and wife.

813
01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.447
They were never supposed to know
we were there.

814
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:03.241
Whole thing's routine, it was a milk run.

815
01:26:05.911 --> 01:26:07.371
Three days in

816
01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:12.167
we caught wind that a serbian hit squad
was after our couple.

817
01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:14.878
But my team had it under control.

818
01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.922
We knew they were coming.

819
01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:21.760
But I couldn't shake this feeling that i
should warn the couple somehow.

820
01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:24.221
I wanted to find a way to let them know.

821
01:26:26.598 --> 01:26:29.518
But, you know, orders are orders,
so I didn't.

822
01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:38.860
One day, the husband decides
to leave the hotel and go for a run,

823
01:26:38.944 --> 01:26:42.948
so I follow him,
and I leave two men with the wife.

824
01:26:44.491 --> 01:26:48.620
When I get back, my guys are
unconscious and the wife is gone.

825
01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:53.458
Local police found her body
three days later.

826
01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:56.420
What was left of her, anyway.

827
01:27:02.092 --> 01:27:04.469
That was my last day in the field.

828
01:27:05.512 --> 01:27:08.598
I couldn't face another
life-or-death situation after that.

829
01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.268
So what happened to the husband?

830
01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:12.477
I never saw him again.

831
01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:16.148
Until two days ago in Moscow,

832
01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:18.984
when the secretary
introduced me to Ethan hunt.

833
01:27:22.696 --> 01:27:26.158
No, that's not what happened.
She left him.

834
01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:28.994
Yeah, I heard that one, too, Benji.

835
01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:32.414
But, unfortunately, I was there.

836
01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:37.627
Just like I was there
when the secretary got the phone call

837
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:42.007
that Ethan was in custody for killing
six serbian nationals in cold blood.

838
01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:43.258
An unsanctioned hit.

839
01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:44.342
Yeah.

840
01:27:44.384 --> 01:27:46.136
Disavowed.

841
01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:56.104
The next thing I know,

842
01:27:57.022 --> 01:27:59.024
I'm on a plane to Dubai,

843
01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:04.112
wondering the whole time, do I tell him?

844
01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:08.033
How do I tell him?

845
01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:12.037
That I'm responsible.

846
01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:15.832
I could have warned him.

847
01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:17.876
I should have warned him.

848
01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:21.797
But I didn't.

849
01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:25.008
And she died.

850
01:28:31.473 --> 01:28:35.185
Sergei! Sergei, my friend!

851
01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:38.271
I told you I would get him here.
Didn't I say?

852
01:28:38.355 --> 01:28:39.523
How do I know it's him?

853
01:28:39.564 --> 01:28:43.068
Yes, it's him.
You trust me, I trust you. Right?

854
01:28:43.568 --> 01:28:45.070
This is the guy!

855
01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:47.823
This is the guy, the one I told you about.

856
01:28:47.906 --> 01:28:50.450
So we can take these things off.

857
01:28:55.205 --> 01:28:58.083
Sorry. He's a great guy,
but he doesn't know you like I do.

858
01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:01.253
So, you work for
the American government.

859
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:04.130
And you're an arms dealer.

860
01:29:04.214 --> 01:29:06.550
No, no, no. Sergei. Sergei.

861
01:29:07.133 --> 01:29:11.179
He's "independent
defense coordinator." Right?

862
01:29:12.389 --> 01:29:14.391
That you are. Very classy job.

863
01:29:14.432 --> 01:29:15.559
Listen. He's a friend.

864
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.185
Those diamonds are for bogdan.

865
01:29:17.269 --> 01:29:19.271
No, no. It's okay. You can have them.

866
01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:22.524
Whatever arrangements you made with
my cousin is between you and him.

867
01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:25.443
You want something from me, you pay.

868
01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:29.781
You misunderstand.
I'm not buying. I'm selling.

869
01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:32.701
You're selling.

870
01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:33.994
Selling what?

871
01:29:34.077 --> 01:29:35.453
The future.

872
01:29:35.537 --> 01:29:38.331
Yeah, I got all I need, thank you.

873
01:29:38.415 --> 01:29:40.083
Our countries are on the brink of war.

874
01:29:40.667 --> 01:29:42.586
War is very good for business.

875
01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:44.170
Nuclear war?

876
01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:55.724
Go on.

877
01:29:55.807 --> 01:29:57.809
I'm looking for a man
named Kurt Hendricks.

878
01:29:57.851 --> 01:29:59.477
You may know him as cobalt.

879
01:29:59.561 --> 01:30:02.314
In either case,
i think you know what he wants.

880
01:30:02.397 --> 01:30:05.066
I'll bet he even tried
to buy it from you at some point.

881
01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:07.527
Go on.

882
01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:09.696
He has a case, he has codes.

883
01:30:10.447 --> 01:30:13.742
But they're worthless
without a tactical satellite.

884
01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:16.161
I want to know where he'd get it.

885
01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:20.332
A man with information like that
would be a potential terrorist.

886
01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:23.209
And to your government,

887
01:30:23.293 --> 01:30:27.380
a potential terrorist is a terrorist.

888
01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:31.343
If you help me,

889
01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:35.680
my friends become your friends.

890
01:30:38.808 --> 01:30:39.976
Sorry.

891
01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:42.938
I cannot help you.

892
01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:51.529
I certainly cannot tell you
that Russia quietly sold

893
01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:55.367
an obsolete tactical satellite
to a certain telecom in Mumbai.

894
01:30:57.202 --> 01:30:59.120
And whoever gave them that idea?

895
01:31:01.081 --> 01:31:03.041
An enterprising third party.

896
01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:04.584
Working on commission.

897
01:31:04.668 --> 01:31:07.921
Helping old friends. Making new ones.

898
01:31:08.588 --> 01:31:09.965
Can the satellite be shut down?

899
01:31:10.048 --> 01:31:11.967
That would take special skills,

900
01:31:12.884 --> 01:31:14.386
and you cannot do it alone.

901
01:31:40.745 --> 01:31:42.414
What's in the bags?

902
01:31:42.455 --> 01:31:43.873
It's our gear.

903
01:31:43.915 --> 01:31:45.750
How'd you get it?

904
01:31:45.792 --> 01:31:46.960
Made a friend.

905
01:31:48.086 --> 01:31:49.379
Well, I'm glad we could help.

906
01:31:49.421 --> 01:31:51.256
You could help now.

907
01:31:51.297 --> 01:31:53.174
Look, Ethan, before we...

908
01:31:53.258 --> 01:31:54.509
Whatever happened, happened.

909
01:31:55.051 --> 01:31:57.804
We still have a chance to clean this up,
but we have to do it now.

910
01:31:58.805 --> 01:32:01.016
And we have to do it together.

911
01:32:08.273 --> 01:32:09.649
Okay. So, where are we going?

912
01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:12.402
India.

913
01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:17.449
- India? India?
- Sure.

914
01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:18.616
Okay. Great.

915
01:32:22.287 --> 01:32:23.788
Love the jet.

916
01:32:24.497 --> 01:32:26.291
Wait till you see the car.

917
01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:33.923
Sidorov.

918
01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:35.633
<i>How have you been, old friend?</i>

919
01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:36.926
Oh, it's you.

920
01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:41.097
I've been busy with other things.

921
01:32:41.139 --> 01:32:43.099
<i>But I'll be after you again soon enough.</i>

922
01:32:45.643 --> 01:32:48.521
I understand you're looking for an American...

923
01:32:48.688 --> 01:32:49.689
Lam.

924
01:32:50.815 --> 01:32:54.152
You're also looking for a nuclear launch device
stolen from the kremlin two days ago.

925
01:32:54.152 --> 01:32:56.654
<i>You're also looking for a nuclear launch device
stolen from the kremlin two days ago.</i>

926
01:32:57.113 --> 01:32:58.156
Lam?

927
01:32:58.406 --> 01:33:00.700
I can help you find both.

928
01:33:01.659 --> 01:33:04.621
If... we can come to an understanding.

929
01:33:10.752 --> 01:33:12.003
<i>An; Nath.</i>

930
01:33:12.045 --> 01:33:14.547
Brij nath. Playboy. Multimedia tycoon.

931
01:33:14.631 --> 01:33:17.592
On the surface,
his entire network is state-of-the-art.

932
01:33:17.675 --> 01:33:19.636
But it's built on illegally acquired

933
01:33:19.677 --> 01:33:23.556
cold war cast-offs, including this,
the novosti satellite.

934
01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:25.433
Hendricks needs it
to launch a nuclear strike,

935
01:33:25.517 --> 01:33:28.019
and we have to shut it down
before he gets that chance.

936
01:33:28.103 --> 01:33:30.688
And to do that, we need to get
the access code from him.

937
01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:32.107
One way or another.

938
01:33:33.358 --> 01:33:34.901
And if I don't,

939
01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.403
none of this works.

940
01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:39.864
You can do this.

941
01:33:39.906 --> 01:33:41.032
Yeah.

942
01:33:41.866 --> 01:33:44.661
A week ago, I would have believed you.

943
01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:52.293
I don't blame you for what happened.

944
01:33:57.048 --> 01:34:00.718
She took someone you cared about.
That's not something you just

945
01:34:01.136 --> 01:34:02.137
let go.

946
01:34:03.888 --> 01:34:06.015
Did it make you feel better?

947
01:34:08.518 --> 01:34:11.437
When you killed the men
who killed your wife?

948
01:34:19.529 --> 01:34:21.406
We can't get them back.

949
01:34:27.787 --> 01:34:29.080
Okay, to shut down the satellite,

950
01:34:29.122 --> 01:34:31.916
we have to manually tap into
the central server.

951
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.628
You'll enter through the exhaust vent,
wearing this under your suit.

952
01:34:35.712 --> 01:34:38.339
Drop down into the computer array,
and I'll catch you,

953
01:34:38.423 --> 01:34:41.759
then move you along the relay room
and you Jack into the panel.

954
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:48.057
Okay, so we enter the party
separately as guests.

955
01:34:48.099 --> 01:34:49.934
Ethan quarterbacks while Jane...

956
01:34:49.976 --> 01:34:51.477
Gets the codes from the billionaire.

957
01:34:51.561 --> 01:34:53.605
I switch off the fan,
you jump into the computer array,

958
01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:55.773
and I catch you,
you plug in the transmitter

959
01:34:55.815 --> 01:34:59.485
then Ethan feeds me the codes which i
then use to pinpoint Hendricks' location.

960
01:34:59.569 --> 01:35:02.780
Okay, but you just breezed over
something I think is really important.

961
01:35:02.822 --> 01:35:05.658
The computer array part, where I just...

962
01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:07.744
Jump?

963
01:35:08.578 --> 01:35:10.205
- And I catch you.
- Yeah.

964
01:35:10.288 --> 01:35:12.040
I don't... why is that so hard to grasp?

965
01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:13.791
Well...

966
01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:18.588
Why? It's a 25-foot drop.
And we're using magnets.

967
01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:19.964
Yeah.

968
01:35:20.715 --> 01:35:23.801
In light of our recent efforts,
the technology's...

969
01:35:23.885 --> 01:35:25.845
The science is sound. All right?

970
01:35:25.929 --> 01:35:27.555
I'd be more worried about the heat.

971
01:35:28.848 --> 01:35:30.975
And then there's that. What heat?

972
01:35:31.768 --> 01:35:32.977
Well, it's like any computer, isn't it?

973
01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:36.064
If you switch off the fan,
it's gonna get really hot!

974
01:35:36.147 --> 01:35:37.232
Of course.

975
01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:38.942
Relatively, you know.

976
01:35:40.443 --> 01:35:43.947
Of course it will. So I'm jumping into a...

977
01:35:45.365 --> 01:35:48.326
An oven, essentially.

978
01:35:48.952 --> 01:35:50.620
Yeah. Essentially.

979
01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:53.122
But I'll catch you.

980
01:35:54.999 --> 01:35:56.167
Great.

981
01:36:24.862 --> 01:36:27.365
<i>Aapka swagat hai,</i> sir. <i>Welcome,</i> sir.

982
01:37:19.042 --> 01:37:20.418
Comm check.

983
01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:23.796
Saturn's got your five-by-five, Jupiter.

984
01:37:25.423 --> 01:37:26.924
This is pluto.

985
01:37:29.093 --> 01:37:31.179
I have arrived at the party.

986
01:37:34.599 --> 01:37:35.600
There he is.

987
01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:49.447
Get us that code.

988
01:37:58.122 --> 01:37:59.916
Venus moving in on target.

989
01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:13.096
Hook's in.

990
01:38:15.139 --> 01:38:17.141
You do make an impression.

991
01:38:21.145 --> 01:38:22.146
Why am I pluto?

992
01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:24.107
<i>It's not even a planet anymore.</i>

993
01:38:24.148 --> 01:38:25.942
Well, I think uranus is available.

994
01:38:25.983 --> 01:38:28.277
It's funny 'cause you said "anus."

995
01:38:42.667 --> 01:38:43.668
I'm in position.

996
01:38:44.252 --> 01:38:46.045
Sending in the rover.

997
01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:51.884
He's moving to you.

998
01:38:51.968 --> 01:38:53.678
<i>Give him your back.</i>

999
01:38:54.554 --> 01:38:56.180
<i>Don't want to make it too easy for him.</i>

1000
01:38:56.264 --> 01:38:57.765
Are you gonna be talking
the whole time?

1001
01:38:58.933 --> 01:39:02.353
In 20 minutes, I want a glass of
cuvée Louis in every guest's hand.

1002
01:39:02.395 --> 01:39:05.398
And make sure all of them have a bottle
to take home by the end of the night.

1003
01:39:05.481 --> 01:39:06.566
Sure.

1004
01:39:10.194 --> 01:39:11.404
Impressed yet?

1005
01:39:12.697 --> 01:39:14.240
I'm more of a bourbon girl.

1006
01:39:20.413 --> 01:39:21.539
I'm brij nath.

1007
01:39:22.039 --> 01:39:24.083
Welcome to my humble home.

1008
01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:48.232
<i>And rover's in position.</i>

1009
01:39:49.567 --> 01:39:50.776
Spinning down the turbine.

1010
01:39:58.951 --> 01:39:59.952
<i>He's e-mailing.</i>

1011
01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:02.205
Venus. Be Venus.

1012
01:40:02.246 --> 01:40:03.581
<i>Be Venus.</i>

1013
01:40:11.881 --> 01:40:13.090
Husband?

1014
01:40:13.758 --> 01:40:14.759
Boyfriend?

1015
01:40:15.801 --> 01:40:17.136
More of a

1016
01:40:18.054 --> 01:40:19.096
co-worker.

1017
01:40:19.889 --> 01:40:21.891
Saturn, take the leap.

1018
01:40:26.479 --> 01:40:27.605
Okay.

1019
01:40:31.567 --> 01:40:33.027
Jumping-

1020
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:34.779
jumping now.

1021
01:40:37.156 --> 01:40:38.157
Jump now?

1022
01:40:38.241 --> 01:40:40.284
Yes. Commit. Jump.

1023
01:40:40.576 --> 01:40:42.286
Jump-
jump-

1024
01:40:42.328 --> 01:40:44.247
- and I catch you.
- Now.

1025
01:40:47.792 --> 01:40:50.962
So, you're sure
about this suit, right, Benji?

1026
01:40:51.003 --> 01:40:52.046
Pretty sure.

1027
01:40:52.797 --> 01:40:55.591
Now you're pretty sure?

1028
01:40:56.676 --> 01:40:57.677
Jump.

1029
01:40:58.803 --> 01:41:00.972
Oh, god. All right.

1030
01:41:01.973 --> 01:41:02.974
Jump.

1031
01:41:04.392 --> 01:41:05.434
Jump!

1032
01:41:23.536 --> 01:41:26.038
<i>Jupiter, he's gone.</i>

1033
01:41:30.543 --> 01:41:31.544
Did you jump?

1034
01:41:31.627 --> 01:41:33.504
Should I not have jumped?

1035
01:41:34.505 --> 01:41:35.506
'Cause I jumped!

1036
01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:39.093
Stand by.

1037
01:41:47.101 --> 01:41:48.603
I'm playing a hunch.

1038
01:41:49.687 --> 01:41:51.147
Don't hit me.

1039
01:42:08.539 --> 01:42:09.582
Hello?

1040
01:42:09.665 --> 01:42:11.417
My god, you are

1041
01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.628
<i>a passionate creature.</i>

1042
01:42:15.546 --> 01:42:18.507
I would like to show you
my collection of art.

1043
01:42:19.175 --> 01:42:21.052
I was waiting for you to ask.

1044
01:42:21.093 --> 01:42:22.887
Then you have to find me.

1045
01:42:22.928 --> 01:42:24.180
You're on.

1046
01:42:24.221 --> 01:42:26.390
I'm heading upstairs.

1047
01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:45.743
<i>All right, now be careful,</i>

1048
01:42:45.785 --> 01:42:47.995
<i>because it's probably getting a bit hot.</i>

1049
01:42:48.079 --> 01:42:50.414
<i>We have to get to that satellite
before Hendricks does.</i>

1050
01:43:05.429 --> 01:43:08.224
<i>Look left. Look up.</i>

1051
01:43:08.265 --> 01:43:10.935
<i>I find your capricious passion intriguing.</i>

1052
01:43:12.269 --> 01:43:14.438
<i>Let me tell you one thing.
He's not your type.</i>

1053
01:43:14.522 --> 01:43:17.775
<i>Completely not your type.
He's completely cold. I'm hot.</i>

1054
01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:22.321
<i>Like all Indian men, I'm very hot.</i>

1055
01:43:22.405 --> 01:43:23.406
Eight o'clock.

1056
01:43:23.447 --> 01:43:24.448
<i>Hot! Very hot.</i>

1057
01:43:24.532 --> 01:43:26.409
He's at your eight o'clock.

1058
01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:28.786
<i>As you move towards me,
you're getting hotter.</i>

1059
01:43:29.787 --> 01:43:32.748
Whoa. Up, up! Up, up!

1060
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:35.251
Too much, too much, too much!

1061
01:43:39.797 --> 01:43:41.132
I see you.

1062
01:43:42.842 --> 01:43:46.387
I'd heard you have one of the finest
private collections in the world.

1063
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:49.056
Well, at the very least, it's private.

1064
01:44:08.159 --> 01:44:10.161
Saturn? How we doing
in the relay room?

1065
01:44:10.202 --> 01:44:11.203
In position.

1066
01:44:13.581 --> 01:44:14.915
I see the satellite.

1067
01:44:21.714 --> 01:44:23.007
Can I help you, gentlemen?

1068
01:44:23.048 --> 01:44:24.633
I don't think so.

1069
01:44:31.015 --> 01:44:32.516
Need those codes, guys.

1070
01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:44.403
All originals from chhatarpur district.

1071
01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:49.950
You know, the tantrics believe

1072
01:44:51.535 --> 01:44:56.290
that the swadhisthana chakra hides
our most subconscious of desires.

1073
01:45:48.259 --> 01:45:52.179
Uplink to satellite.
Reboot to original military specs.

1074
01:45:52.513 --> 01:45:54.265
Download the virus.

1075
01:46:02.106 --> 01:46:03.399
What the hell is that?

1076
01:46:05.276 --> 01:46:06.360
What the hell is that?

1077
01:46:06.443 --> 01:46:07.444
What the hell is what?

1078
01:46:07.486 --> 01:46:08.863
It's going haywire!

1079
01:46:08.946 --> 01:46:10.906
It's downloaded a virus
from the satellite.

1080
01:46:10.948 --> 01:46:12.157
Hendricks is killing the server

1081
01:46:12.241 --> 01:46:13.868
<i>before we can kill the satellite.</i>

1082
01:46:13.951 --> 01:46:16.078
Hendricks is reprogramming
the satellite.

1083
01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:19.206
<i>He's gonna have launch
capability in five minutes!</i>

1084
01:46:19.290 --> 01:46:21.250
- Something wrong?
- No.

1085
01:46:21.917 --> 01:46:24.128
Jane, you gotta move.
We need that code.

1086
01:46:24.169 --> 01:46:26.046
Finally we're alone.

1087
01:46:33.804 --> 01:46:36.265
Venus, now's the time. Kick his ass

1088
01:46:36.307 --> 01:46:37.975
<i>and get the code.</i>

1089
01:46:38.309 --> 01:46:41.478
We are alone, aren't we?

1090
01:46:42.146 --> 01:46:44.815
No one will interrupt us.

1091
01:46:49.153 --> 01:46:50.821
Move and I break your neck.

1092
01:46:50.905 --> 01:46:53.490
The override sequence
for the relay station.

1093
01:46:53.574 --> 01:46:55.868
Say it now or never speak again.

1094
01:46:56.869 --> 01:46:58.078
The codes.

1095
01:46:59.330 --> 01:47:01.624
<i>46, 82,</i>

1096
01:47:02.499 --> 01:47:04.001
<i>93.</i>

1097
01:47:06.921 --> 01:47:07.922
Benji, what happened?

1098
01:47:08.005 --> 01:47:09.798
The system's crashed! We're too late.

1099
01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.508
<i>No, no, no. He's revealed himself.</i>

1100
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:13.177
Benji, can you pinpoint
Hendricks' location?

1101
01:47:14.386 --> 01:47:16.430
Hendricks is signaling out of a state-run

1102
01:47:16.513 --> 01:47:18.390
<i>TV station 6.7 miles from here.</i>

1103
01:47:18.474 --> 01:47:19.516
Send me the coordinates.

1104
01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:21.268
Good work, Brandt.
Now get the hell out of there.

1105
01:47:21.352 --> 01:47:22.478
Back me up!

1106
01:47:22.519 --> 01:47:24.605
Jane, tie it off with nath
and meet me at the rally point.

1107
01:47:30.527 --> 01:47:31.528
Sleep tight

1108
01:47:32.863 --> 01:47:34.740
faster, Benji! Just straight through!

1109
01:47:38.869 --> 01:47:40.245
Wait! Stop!

1110
01:47:40.329 --> 01:47:41.872
<i>Take me through!</i>

1111
01:47:41.914 --> 01:47:44.917
<i>It's not responding! A little bit of
Patience would be appreciated!</i>

1112
01:48:00.599 --> 01:48:02.476
I can't reach the top!

1113
01:48:04.395 --> 01:48:06.271
More fan! More fan!

1114
01:48:06.355 --> 01:48:07.731
<i>More fan!</i>

1115
01:48:07.815 --> 01:48:09.692
There's nothing I can do! It's maxed out!

1116
01:48:27.084 --> 01:48:28.293
<i>Brandt?</i>

1117
01:48:28.377 --> 01:48:29.586
<i>Brandt?</i>

1118
01:48:31.130 --> 01:48:34.466
Next time, I get to seduce the rich guy.

1119
01:48:45.269 --> 01:48:47.563
Satellite weaponized and online.

1120
01:48:47.604 --> 01:48:49.982
Upload the new authentication codes.

1121
01:48:50.065 --> 01:48:52.026
Lock Russian central command
out of the system.

1122
01:48:52.443 --> 01:48:53.861
Isolate the sub.

1123
01:48:53.944 --> 01:48:58.615
We'll fire just one missile,
an apparent retaliation for the kremlin.

1124
01:48:59.116 --> 01:49:00.951
That should start the ball rolling.

1125
01:49:00.993 --> 01:49:02.119
<i>I'm here, Ethan.</i>

1126
01:49:02.161 --> 01:49:04.246
How long until Hendricks
can launch a missile?

1127
01:49:05.289 --> 01:49:06.540
Less than 30 seconds!

1128
01:49:08.333 --> 01:49:10.210
We need another route.

1129
01:49:11.295 --> 01:49:12.963
Turn left up ahead,
take the alley on the right.

1130
01:49:28.228 --> 01:49:29.229
We have uplink.

1131
01:49:39.948 --> 01:49:42.534
Ethan, Hendricks
has started the launch sequence.

1132
01:49:42.618 --> 01:49:44.328
How much time until missiles are flying?

1133
01:49:44.369 --> 01:49:45.621
<i>Three minutes!</i>

1134
01:49:49.374 --> 01:49:50.876
We're three and a half minutes out.

1135
01:49:54.338 --> 01:49:55.339
We can make it.

1136
01:49:57.174 --> 01:49:58.175
We can make it.

1137
01:50:04.765 --> 01:50:05.766
Captain...

1138
01:50:10.562 --> 01:50:13.065
Connect to central command for launch verification.

1139
01:50:13.148 --> 01:50:14.149
Right away.

1140
01:50:16.026 --> 01:50:18.737
Proceed with operation "iron fist".

1141
01:50:18.904 --> 01:50:20.697
<i>Command to launch is confirmed.</i>

1142
01:50:21.073 --> 01:50:23.033
Cease all further communication.

1143
01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.201
<i>Over and out.</i>

1144
01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:27.830
Next left.

1145
01:50:41.301 --> 01:50:42.302
Proceed.

1146
01:51:03.615 --> 01:51:05.868
Ethan? We're too late.

1147
01:51:05.909 --> 01:51:07.911
<i>The missile's in the air.</i>

1148
01:51:20.299 --> 01:51:22.092
There has to be a way
to abort the warhead.

1149
01:51:22.134 --> 01:51:23.927
If there is one,
it'll be on the launch device.

1150
01:51:23.969 --> 01:51:25.345
We're gonna get that case.

1151
01:51:36.023 --> 01:51:38.609
May there be peace on earth.

1152
01:51:43.614 --> 01:51:45.240
Disable the relay.

1153
01:51:46.617 --> 01:51:48.702
Get wistrom! Inside, inside!

1154
01:52:23.195 --> 01:52:25.072
Wistrom destroyed the relay.

1155
01:52:25.155 --> 01:52:26.365
Ethan went after Hendricks
and the case, but...

1156
01:52:26.448 --> 01:52:28.659
Doesn't matter if he has the case.
We can't transmit the abort codes.

1157
01:52:28.992 --> 01:52:29.993
Can you fix it?

1158
01:52:30.035 --> 01:52:32.788
Yeah... it's gonna be pointless
if we don't have any power.

1159
01:52:32.829 --> 01:52:33.830
Wistrom!

1160
01:52:35.916 --> 01:52:37.584
- Jane!
- I'm okay.

1161
01:52:39.336 --> 01:52:41.630
No, you are not okay. She's hit.

1162
01:52:42.047 --> 01:52:43.674
You stay here and cover Benji.

1163
01:52:43.715 --> 01:52:46.718
Benji, get this thing rewired
and back online. I'll get the power on.

1164
01:52:46.802 --> 01:52:48.345
We can do this.

1165
01:56:02.747 --> 01:56:05.542
I'm taking that briefcase!

1166
01:56:09.087 --> 01:56:10.589
No! No!

1167
01:56:57.886 --> 01:56:59.346
He's been gone too long.

1168
01:56:59.429 --> 01:57:00.931
Damn it! Listen.

1169
01:57:00.972 --> 01:57:03.934
When the power comes on,
these two drives go into this bay, okay?

1170
01:57:47.936 --> 01:57:50.564
Mission accomplished!

1171
01:58:32.022 --> 01:58:33.273
Don't touch him!

1172
01:58:39.946 --> 01:58:41.781
This one is mine.

1173
01:58:53.918 --> 01:58:56.713
So, we are not enemies.

1174
01:58:58.632 --> 01:59:01.343
The phone call
from that arms dealer in Dubai.

1175
01:59:01.635 --> 01:59:03.219
You wanted me to find you.

1176
01:59:07.265 --> 01:59:09.309
How else to believe this?

1177
01:59:16.941 --> 01:59:17.942
Hospital?

1178
01:59:20.195 --> 01:59:22.280
<i>And in other news, eight weeks later,</i>

1179
01:59:22.364 --> 01:59:23.948
<i>the debate continues.</i>

1180
01:59:24.032 --> 01:59:28.411
<i>Eyewitnesses remain adamant
that the object was some sort of aircraft,</i>

1181
01:59:28.453 --> 01:59:32.290
<i>but officials with the department of
defense insist it was simply a meteor</i>

1182
01:59:32.374 --> 01:59:35.085
<i>large enough to be
visible during daylight.</i>

1183
01:59:35.335 --> 01:59:37.253
You actually said that.

1184
01:59:37.587 --> 01:59:38.880
Out loud.

1185
01:59:39.506 --> 01:59:40.924
"Mission accomplished."

1186
01:59:41.007 --> 01:59:42.092
I said it.

1187
01:59:42.133 --> 01:59:44.719
You're still corny, Ethan.

1188
01:59:44.761 --> 01:59:47.597
I can't imagine
the look on that guy's face.

1189
01:59:49.391 --> 01:59:51.434
- Hey.
- This must be them.

1190
01:59:51.518 --> 01:59:54.813
Luther stickell,
the firm of Carter, Dunn and Brandt.

1191
01:59:56.439 --> 02:00:00.276
I blew an entire weekend
on the bottom of the San Francisco bay

1192
02:00:01.403 --> 02:00:03.363
no thanks to you clowns.

1193
02:00:05.699 --> 02:00:07.283
No, man, you know I got this.

1194
02:00:08.284 --> 02:00:10.787
I know. I'll see you in kandahar.

1195
02:00:14.582 --> 02:00:16.710
Thanks for meeting me.

1196
02:00:16.793 --> 02:00:19.129
So, I hear the insurance
company's refusing

1197
02:00:19.170 --> 02:00:21.381
to pay the claim
on that car you crashed, Ethan.

1198
02:00:21.464 --> 02:00:25.135
Something about intentional 100-meter
vertical drops not being covered.

1199
02:00:25.176 --> 02:00:26.344
Go figure.

1200
02:00:29.931 --> 02:00:31.558
How's the leg?

1201
02:00:31.641 --> 02:00:32.892
Still working.

1202
02:00:33.810 --> 02:00:34.853
You?

1203
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:36.479
Heafing.

1204
02:00:38.356 --> 02:00:39.524
I'm fine, by the way.

1205
02:00:40.859 --> 02:00:42.527
I mean, I'm not actually sleeping, per se.

1206
02:00:42.819 --> 02:00:45.655
You know. Cold sweats.
Middle of the night.

1207
02:00:47.323 --> 02:00:49.909
All these people
are just happy and smiling

1208
02:00:49.993 --> 02:00:51.745
and they are completely
oblivious to the fact

1209
02:00:51.828 --> 02:00:53.913
that they were almost vaporized.

1210
02:00:54.998 --> 02:00:56.666
And if it hadn't been for...

1211
02:00:56.708 --> 02:00:58.042
Dumb luck?

1212
02:00:58.501 --> 02:00:59.502
Was it?

1213
02:01:00.962 --> 02:01:04.466
I mean, look,
we were unprepared, in the dark.

1214
02:01:04.966 --> 02:01:06.301
Disavowed.

1215
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:09.304
And the only thing
that functioned properly

1216
02:01:10.221 --> 02:01:11.765
on that mission

1217
02:01:12.682 --> 02:01:14.184
was this team.

1218
02:01:16.269 --> 02:01:18.855
I don't know how we ended up together,

1219
02:01:20.648 --> 02:01:22.066
but I'm glad we did.

1220
02:01:29.532 --> 02:01:30.742
Your missions.

1221
02:01:31.701 --> 02:01:33.536
Choose to accept them.

1222
02:01:39.125 --> 02:01:40.794
Hey, look, I'm in.

1223
02:01:41.169 --> 02:01:42.754
Seriously. It's not as if any mission

1224
02:01:42.837 --> 02:01:44.964
is gonna be rougher
than the last one, is it?

1225
02:01:46.382 --> 02:01:47.675
I mean, that's just...

1226
02:01:47.717 --> 02:01:49.385
Bomb... is it?

1227
02:02:07.737 --> 02:02:09.072
Thanks, Ethan.

1228
02:02:09.405 --> 02:02:10.573
Thank you.

1229
02:02:12.575 --> 02:02:13.576
Agent hunt.

1230
02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:15.036
Agent Carter.

1231
02:02:23.628 --> 02:02:24.671
Brandt.

1232
02:02:28.341 --> 02:02:29.884
I'm not picking up that phone, Ethan,

1233
02:02:29.926 --> 02:02:32.554
because I don't think
you want me in the field.

1234
02:02:35.515 --> 02:02:37.475
I know your wife is dead.

1235
02:02:39.644 --> 02:02:41.855
I was there in Croatia.

1236
02:02:43.606 --> 02:02:45.108
I was there for one reason.

1237
02:02:45.149 --> 02:02:46.317
One.

1238
02:02:47.110 --> 02:02:48.570
And I failed.

1239
02:02:53.116 --> 02:02:54.701
It was my job to protect her.

1240
02:02:55.410 --> 02:02:56.870
How do you know she's dead?

1241
02:03:00.248 --> 02:03:01.291
There was a body.

1242
02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:03.001
Did you see it?

1243
02:03:06.713 --> 02:03:08.798
You killed those serbians.

1244
02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:09.924
I had to get her back.

1245
02:03:09.966 --> 02:03:11.551
You were sent to rankow prison.

1246
02:03:11.634 --> 02:03:13.469
That was a sacrifice
i was willing to make.

1247
02:03:13.511 --> 02:03:16.306
Imf suspected Hendricks
had people in rankow.

1248
02:03:19.017 --> 02:03:21.644
And six dead serbians
was the ideal cover.

1249
02:03:23.521 --> 02:03:25.356
Waste not, want not.

1250
02:03:42.373 --> 02:03:44.500
The secretary never told me.

1251
02:03:47.795 --> 02:03:51.674
I accepted the rankow prison mission
on one condition:

1252
02:03:51.716 --> 02:03:53.927
That no one could know
she was still alive.

1253
02:03:55.511 --> 02:03:57.805
But you're telling me.

1254
02:04:05.855 --> 02:04:08.441
When did you find out
that I was in Croatia?

1255
02:04:09.108 --> 02:04:11.069
I pulled your file after India.

1256
02:04:11.945 --> 02:04:13.154
Right.

1257
02:04:15.114 --> 02:04:17.659
So you had to fake your wife's death.

1258
02:04:18.493 --> 02:04:21.871
As long as we were together,
she could never be safe.

1259
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:25.625
It wasn't your job to protect her, Brandt.

1260
02:04:28.127 --> 02:04:29.379
It's mine.

1261
02:04:31.547 --> 02:04:32.674
Okay.

1262
02:04:36.636 --> 02:04:37.887
So we're good.

1263
02:04:39.222 --> 02:04:40.556
We're good.

1264
02:05:40.283 --> 02:05:42.035
Come on!

1265
02:06:02.055 --> 02:06:03.139
<i>Good evening, Mr. hunt.</i>

1266
02:06:03.222 --> 02:06:07.518
<i>36 hours ago, there was a breach
in our military's communication network.</i>

1267
02:06:07.643 --> 02:06:11.147
<i>Now, an emerging terror
organization known as the syndicate</i>

1268
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:14.859
<i>has control of our entire drone fleet.
Their targets: Unknown.</i>

1269
02:06:15.151 --> 02:06:17.862
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it...</i>
