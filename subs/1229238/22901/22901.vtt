3
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,191
Go around.

4
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,432
Prick.

5
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,794
Zakes?

6
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,402
Oh. hello. sleeping beauty.

7
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,732
- Are we there yet?
- Nearly.

8
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,841
- Are you hungry?
- God. I'm starving.

9
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,640
- Are there any biscuits left?
- I saved you the last Boaster.

10
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,743
You know how moany you get
if you don't get food.

11
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,703
What are you doing?

12
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,503
Nothing.

13
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,245
Oh. my camera battery's dead.

14
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,407
When we get to the services.
Can I use your phone to take photos?

15
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:30,077
Yeah. sure. but why do they make you
take photos of the posters you put up?

16
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,688
They say it's for the clients.

17
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:36,452
No. it's because they think
you're a lazy slacker. more like.

18
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,132
Oh. bollocks. Memory's full.
I'll have to delete some.

19
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:53,070
- They're of our holiday.
- Egypt. Land of a thousand arguments.

20
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,213
Look at that.

21
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,448
- What is it? I can't see it properly.
- A photo of the stars.

22
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,042
Remember that night on the beach?
The one with the brilliant sky?

23
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,119
Why did you just call me a slacker?

24
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,190
It was a joke. Jesus.

25
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,655
- I loved that night.
- Yeah.

26
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,419
Yeah.

27
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,967
- Oh. you don't remember it. do you?
- Yes. I do.

28
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,467
The stars. Lovely.

29
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,833
Oh. my God. You don't remember.

30
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,338
It's just sky. Beth.

31
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,498
You've seen one star.
You've seen them all.

32
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,770
- Shall I just delete these pictures?
- No.

33
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,507
No. don't be silly.

34
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,608
Come on.

35
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,917
It's not that big a deal. is it?

36
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,426
<i>Hi.</i> It's Sarah.

37
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,463
<i>I can't get to the phone right now,
so leave a message.</i>

38
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,700
Hi. it's me.

39
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,429
Look. I don't think I'll be able
to make the party tonight.

40
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,402
I still haven't told Zakes
about what I did with Leo.

41
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:36,513
I've tried. but every time
I'm gonna say something. I ju...

42
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,073
Oh. God. I feel shit. Sarah.

43
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,681
I don't know why I did it.

44
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,050
Listen. when you get this.
Can you give me a call?

45
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,747
Bye.

46
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,862
Oh.

47
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,134
Can I use your phone for the photos?

48
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,668
Cheers.

49
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,912
Have you got some petrol money?

50
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,477
No. thanks.

51
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,420
Hello?

52
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,459
Hello?

53
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,054
How many more do we have to do?
- One.

54
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,789
You know. that twat Leo
just called your phone and hung up.

55
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,092
- Leo?
- Yeah. Leo.

56
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,395
It is his sister's birthday.
Probably calling to see if we're going.

57
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,472
He's a sniffer waiting for his chance.
What a cock.

58
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,139
- Zakes?
- What is he. about 40?

59
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,142
People who wear their mobiles
on their belts like that

60
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,577
- are either dads or pricks.
- He's not that bad.

61
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,982
I'm doing this job because it lets me...

62
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,745
Finish your book.

63
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,651
Yeah. I know. I know.

64
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,194
You don't think I can be a writer.
Do you?

65
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,887
I don't know.
I've never read anything you've finished.

66
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,761
Well. I'm not really feeling my writing
at the minute.

67
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:14,268
Don't you think you should put an effort in.
Even if you're not really feeling it?

68
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,097
Is this about my writing or us?

69
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,312
Do you really not remember the sky.
Zakes?

70
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,143
Oh. for fuck's sake.

71
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,218
- Why are you still going on about that?
- Because it upset me.

72
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,282
- Like you're not bothered about us.
- Do you know what?

73
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,721
I am not doing this.

74
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,761
Do you realize it's a year
since you said we'd move in together.

75
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,866
And you haven't even
mentioned it since.

76
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,312
Where's the flask?

77
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,643
Help!

78
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,077
Jesus.

79
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,286
Jesus.

80
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,950
Beth?

81
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,526
Beth. Beth. Beth. wake up!

82
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:21,256
I think I just saw a woman
naked in the back of that truck.

83
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,926
A naked fucking woman locked up.
Caged in the back of that truck.

84
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,897
- What the fuck?
- What are you on about. Zakes?

85
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,735
That truck overtook us.

86
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,501
He pulled up there in front of us.

87
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,112
The shutter came up
and there was a woman stood there

88
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,544
with no clothes on. naked.
And she was screaming.

89
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,717
Jesus Christ.

90
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,981
Oh. my God.

91
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,488
Shit.

92
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,330
Right. Well. what are we gonna do?

93
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,324
Zakes?

94
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,832
Yeah. your phone. Give me your phone.

95
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,563
Hello? Yeah. police.

96
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,707
Yeah. I don't know. but I think I've just
seen something really weird on the motorway.

97
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,611
The M1.

98
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:13,907
Well. it was a woman.

99
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:18,317
She was tied up naked
in the back of a white truck.

100
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,724
Yeah. my name's Zakes. Zakes Abbot.

101
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,051
The plates.

102
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,689
Just hang on a sec.

103
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,528
The fucking plates have shit
all over them. Fuck.

104
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,394
No. No. I can't see the plates. no.

105
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,734
Okay. thanks. Bye.

106
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,466
What did they say?

107
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,702
They said they're gonna get someone
on to it.

108
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,777
But I really think they need the plates.

109
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,607
Shit.

110
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,883
Maybe we should go and get them.

111
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,851
- What? Are you mad?
- Zakes. we have to do something.

112
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,957
- Jesus fucking Christ. Zakes.
- All right.

113
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,390
Okay. you want me to do something.
All right.

114
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,034
Zakes!

115
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,263
Oh. shit.

116
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,329
I can't see anything.

117
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,996
For fuck's sake.

118
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,018
Yeah. all right. all right.

119
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,650
- You were meant to get the plates.
- Couldn't get that shit off.

120
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,592
- What were you doing?
- Took a picture of inside the truck.

121
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,356
- Look.
- I can't see anything.

122
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh. shit.

123
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,470
- Oh. shit.
- What are we gonna do now?

124
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,605
Right. I'm gonna overtake him.

125
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,542
See if you can see his front plates.
Yeah?

126
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,111
I can't.

127
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,683
- I can't see them.
- Oh. shit.

128
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,583
I can't see anything.

129
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,453
Hello? Police.

130
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,323
Just called a minute ago
about a truck on the M1.

131
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,360
I saw a woman caged in the back.

132
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,964
Yeah. a woman. It was a white truck.

133
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,101
No. I couldn't see his plates.

134
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,237
- What junction?
- It was Junction 30. just past Workshop.

135
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,636
We think Junction 30.
Just past Workshop. heading north.

136
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,070
Yeah.

137
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:56,680
- Okay. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.
- Well?

138
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,975
Something about cameras.
Said they'll sort it.

139
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,139
- How?
- I don't know.

140
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,877
- By stopping every truck on the M1?
- I don't know.

141
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,749
They said we shouldn't get involved.

142
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,318
- What are you doing?
- Look.

143
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,118
Either way.
It isn't our problem any more.

144
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,521
Oh. it isn't our problem?

145
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,027
No! What can we do?

146
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm not sure if I saw anything anyway.

147
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,827
- It was all so quick.
- Jesus.

148
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,534
Fuck.

149
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,272
Zakes.

150
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,000
Zakes. Police.

151
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,166
- Zakes.
- I see it.

152
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,678
Pull up behind him. flash him
and tell him about the truck.

153
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,341
Zakes. Zakes. flash him.

154
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,388
- What are you doing?
- This.

155
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,686
- This garage. our last stop.
- You're kidding.

156
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,625
- We miss it. we have to go round.
- You're stopping the car

157
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,732
- to put posters in a toilet!
- This is my job. Beth.

158
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,926
Look. I've called the police.

159
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,661
Jesus. I even got out of the car.

160
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,033
To help
or because you were pissed off with me?

161
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,642
Yeah. sure. You do things.
But your priorities. they're all fucked up!

162
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,778
- Jesus!
- This isn't even about the truck.

163
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:05,074
This is about me and what a fuck
up you think I am. All right.

164
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,217
I'll finish me book
as soon as we get home.

165
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,911
I'll wrack me brains to remember the sky.
Can move in together this evening.

166
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,647
In fact. right fucking now.
Is that all good with you?

167
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,315
Why have you come tonight.
To have a fucking go at me?

168
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,587
To try and do something
with our relationship!

169
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,094
Oh. like I never do anything.

170
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,732
Not things that mean you have
to go out of your way!

171
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,164
<i>- That poor woman!
- I go out of my way for you.</i>

172
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,066
What? When?
Oh. yeah. you saved me a shitty biscuit!

173
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,571
Oh. I can't do this on my own any more!

174
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,504
When are you gonna fucking grow up?

175
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,534
I'm gonna get a coffee.

176
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,171
Beth. I need your phone
to take photos of the posters.

177
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,384
I've deleted the sky.

178
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:26,587
So now you can fill my phone with pictures
of toilets as much as you want. okay?

179
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,058
Fuck.

180
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,716
Let's <i>go...</i>

181
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,917
Hey.

182
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,815
What's this. you wanker?

183
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,455
Fucking dickhead!

184
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,600
- Can I nip in?
- It's out of order.

185
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,797
I just wanna put these up.

186
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:26,148
Are there any posters
in the disabled toilet?

187
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,180
Okay.

188
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,945
Oh. Jesus Christ.

189
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,321
Hurry up.

190
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,913
Next.

191
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,591
Next.

192
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,089
That's 1.10. please.

193
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,236
- Yeah. thanks.
- Thank you.

194
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,864
Beth. look at this.

195
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,141
- I need to tell you something.
- No. hang on a minute.

196
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,345
<i>This is the photo that I took of the
inside of the back of that truck.</i>

197
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,349
Now. give me your hand.

198
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:10,847
Just hold it still.

199
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,853
Look at that.

200
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,558
Yeah?

201
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,223
Well. it's proof.

202
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,762
It's a hand.
Someone was in the back of that truck.

203
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,557
- What. proof?
- Yeah.

204
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,560
What good is that now. Zakes?

205
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,131
That truck is miles away.

206
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,207
Zakes.

207
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,508
You know. sitting here right now.
I've realized that the...

208
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:44,645
The only thing that is holding us together
is the time we've spent together.

209
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,158
Because we're not working.

210
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,726
I know that I'm partly responsible
for that and I'm sorry. but...

211
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,998
Well. who you are right now...

212
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,359
it isn't good enough for me. Zakes.

213
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,832
I'm sorry.

214
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,981
Gonna make my own way
back to Manchester.

215
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,814
- Don't be stupid. I can take you back.
- I don't want you to. okay?

216
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,524
I really... I don't want that.

217
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:23,852
Beth.

218
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,620
Beth. ju...

219
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,532
I'll be waiting in the car!

220
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,867
<i>Hi, Sarah. Listen, it's me.</i>

221
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,205
<i>I know tonight's your party and all,
but, look, I need your help.</i>

222
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,713
<i>I've broken up with Zakes.</i>

223
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,682
<i>Can you come pick me up?
I'm at Stanhope Services on the M1.</i>

224
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,811
I don't have my phone on me.
But maybe I'll try you later.

225
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,073
Let's see what the sniffer's got to say.

226
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,229
Hello?

227
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,527
Hello?

228
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,501
Whoa.

229
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,600
What...?

230
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,908
When you've finished. get in here.
Go round the back.

231
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,882
<i>Oh. God.</i>

232
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,253
Beth.

233
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,921
Oh. I'm sorry. Sorry.

234
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,395
Sorry. I didn't...

235
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,991
Beth?

236
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,960
Beth?

237
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,673
Beth. are you in here?

238
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,779
Look. I'm sorry. okay?

239
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,258
Beth.

240
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,527
- Beth.
- Ah!

241
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,497
- Sorry.
Ls everything okay in here?

242
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,534
- What's going on here?
- What you doing?

243
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,865
Nothing. I was looking for my girlfriend.

244
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,436
Might look like something else. but...

245
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,008
He was spying on me!
- No.

246
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,042
- You pervert.
- No. I thought you were...

247
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,114
I'm looking for my girlfriend.
I thought she might be in here.

248
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,840
- Yeah. yeah. I get it.
- What?

249
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,747
Get back from the game all tanked up?

250
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:26,252
- Your mates put you up to it. Very funny.
- Oh. no. no. You think I'm...

251
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,651
I'm a poster guy. right?

252
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,021
I put posters up. like this one.
I put the one of the car up outside.

253
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,923
- Look. here.
- Ronnie. watch out!

254
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,288
Get off!

255
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,027
- Don't move! I said don't move!
- For fuck's sake. I'm not. Jesus.

256
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,171
Ronnie. are you okay?

257
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,671
- You've got it wrong.
- Yeah. I'll get rid of him.

258
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,502
I'm looking for my... Ah!

259
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,009
- I'm looking for my girlfriend.
- Outside. son.

260
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,613
Jesus Christ!

261
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,377
Fuck! Just take it easy!
Don't have to pull that hard!

262
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,985
Fucking hell!

263
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,960
Fucking hell.
All right. just take it easy.

264
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,527
- Yeah. yeah. I've heard you.
- Jesus Christ.

265
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,427
Jesus.

266
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,033
What's your problem?
I was looking for my girlfriend.

267
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,863
You should be helping me.

268
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,937
Prick.

269
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,111
<i>Oh. God. no.</i>

270
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,940
Shit.

271
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,727
What the fuck?

272
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,396
Mate. mate. stop! Stop the car!

273
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,836
Sorry. love. I've got to take your car.

274
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,222
Woman driver smacks
into another car. right?

275
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,361
The driver gets out and it's a dwarf.

276
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,554
So he says to the woman.
"I'm not happy."

277
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,531
So she says.
"Which fucking one are you then?"

278
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,935
Oh. fair enough.

279
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,301
Well. I'm off.

280
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,602
- What are you doing?
- He was telling the truth.

281
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:08,835
He's the poster guy.

282
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,536
He wasn't with the football guys.

283
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,545
See this?

284
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,810
This is a key to the big poster frames.
And look.

285
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,681
He was with a woman.

286
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,116
So what?

287
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,815
He said he couldn't find his girlfriend.
That she had disappeared.

288
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,587
That's why he was in the toilet.
He was looking for her.

289
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,754
Listen. mate.
I've seen this a hundred times before.

290
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,027
Couples on long drives.
They fight. they argue.

291
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:36,229
I bet you any money.
She's waiting at home for him right now.

292
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,374
But what if she's not?

293
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,600
What. you gonna look through
all the tapes?

294
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,207
That'll take you all night.

295
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,244
Then that's how long it's going to take.

296
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,406
Why? Who cares? it's not our problem.

297
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,146
Our job is to protect this place.
That's it.

298
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,455
What?

299
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,382
I'm off home.

300
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,458
See you tomorrow.

301
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,938
Got you.

302
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,114
Oh. no.

303
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,246
No. come on.

304
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,759
Come on.

305
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,451
Come on.

306
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,621
Oh. no. don't do this to me.

307
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,727
Please.

308
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,462
Where are you?

309
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,164
Okay. now. where are you?

310
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,307
I thought you was going home.

311
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,605
Yeah. so did I.

312
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,305
But I couldn't have you being the hero
all on your own.

313
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,815
- Find anything yet?
- Yes and no.

314
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,282
Look.

315
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,887
There she is at the car.

316
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,546
Then she goes inside. has a coffee.

317
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,488
The poster guy comes. She leaves.

318
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,357
<i>Then. look. look. look. See?</i>

319
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,399
She made a phone call.

320
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,227
But then she just disappears.

321
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,429
- Let's try Zone B.
- <i>I'll</i> do it.

322
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:17,664
What's the time code?

323
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:23,745
Time code 00:17:04.

324
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,049
No. I can't see her.

325
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,485
It doesn't make no sense.

326
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,920
She came down the corridor.

327
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,628
And there's nowhere else for her to go.

328
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,060
Man. look.
You tapped in the wrong time code.

329
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,927
- Man.
- Come on. man.

330
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:50,471
Zero. zero. one. seven. zero. four.

331
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,973
She goes through the emergency doors
with someone.

332
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,211
Why doesn't the alarm go off?

333
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,580
Argh!

334
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,196
Yeah. it's me.

335
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,739
We have a problem.

336
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,467
That girl we took.

337
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,370
Boyfriend's made trouble.

338
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,309
Yeah. I think he may be following you.

339
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,889
Got you. you bastard.

340
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,944
Where is he?

341
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,116
Oh. no.

342
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,850
Oh. shit.

343
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,894
<i>I repeat, Ford Granada,
license plate Lima-Echo-Charlie</i>

344
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,301
Oh. Jesus.

345
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,987
Yeah. Yes. Yeah. yeah. yeah. Stop.

346
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,731
Stop here. Yeah. Yes.

347
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,198
Slow down. slow down. slow down.
Yeah.

348
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,701
I need you to help me.
I need you to help me.

349
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,238
I need you to get out of the car
quick. please.

350
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,441
Come on. come on.

351
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,738
- My girlfriend's in one of these trucks.
- All right. take it easy.

352
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,437
- Just calm down.
- No. I am calm.

353
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,209
- I want you to check one of the trucks.
- Take it easy.

354
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,215
My girlfriend's... Jesus!

355
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,752
Give me your hand.
- What are you doing? Ah!

356
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,516
- Got anything on you? Carrying anything?
- Fuck! No.

357
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,286
Anything you say may be used
in evidence against you.

358
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,723
Do you understand?

359
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,999
All right. listen to me.
Someone has taken my girlfriend.

360
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,657
- I need you to...
- Listen to me.

361
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,962
You calm the fuck down. Okay?

362
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,532
- Okay?
Okay,

363
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,341
What's your name?

364
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:18,974
Zakes.

365
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,410
Zakes Abbot.

366
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:25,214
Golf Alpha three-nine.
I've got a 112 under arrest.

367
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,653
Suspect named Zakes Abbott.
Linked to a stolen Granada.

368
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,884
<i>Got a van
at the services- Can you meet them?</i>

369
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,356
Roger.
- No.

370
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,621
No. no. no.
Please. don't drive me away.

371
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,492
Look. my girlfriend's gone missing.

372
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,558
Please. I just...

373
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:42,261
I just... I just want you to find her.

374
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,337
Look. that's all.

375
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:48,671
I won't cause you any trouble.
I promise. Fuck.

376
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,844
I took the car because I needed it.

377
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,847
My girlfriend Beth.

378
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,677
She's been taken
by someone in a truck

379
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,083
and I think he's parked in here.

380
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,356
Look. I'm telling you the truth.

381
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,289
Oh. I remember... Yeah. yeah. yeah.

382
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,656
Earlier I called 999.

383
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,094
Yeah. about the same truck.

384
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,734
About an hour ago.
I saw a woman tied up in the back

385
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,598
and I think the same truck
took my girlfriend.

386
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:19,396
Look. please. he's parked in here.

387
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:25,780
All I need you to do is just go out
and have a look.

388
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,677
That's all.

389
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,946
Fucking hell.

390
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,486
I'm not going anywhere.

391
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,692
Please. just look for a truck
with a broken taillight.

392
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,578
<i>Golf Alpha three-nine,
please be advised,</i>

393
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,111
<i>the suspect has marks for violence</i>

394
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,476
<i>- and is wanted on suspicion for murder.

395
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,743
<i>Golf Alpha three-nine, over.</i>

396
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,810

397
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,216
<i>Golf Alpha three-nine?</i>

398
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,188
<i>Golf Alpha three-nine,

399
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,360
<i>Golf Alpha three-nine?</i>

400
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,760
<i>Golf Alpha three-nine,

401
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,642
Fuck.

402
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,052
<i>Golf Alpha three-nine, I repeat,</i>

403
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,049
<i>the suspect is currently wanted
on suspicion for murder.</i>

404
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,191
<i>- Ah!
- Golf Alpha three-nine, over.</i>

405
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,761
<i>Golf Alpha three-nine.</i>

406
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,951
Here. mate.
Mate. I need to use your phone.

407
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,588
- You got a phone?
- Get off me.

408
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,054
Fuck. Fuck.

409
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,913
All right. roger.

410
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,571
See you.

411
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,548
Anyway. so I kept saying...

412
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:29,885
- So how do you feel?
- I feel fantastic.

413
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,958
Ow!

414
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,134
Come on.

415
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,585
Oh. come on.

416
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,296
Oh. come on.

417
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,396
Come on!

418
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,800
<i>Oh. no. no. no.</i>

419
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,173
Come on!

420
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,992
Oh. Jesus Christ. Oh. fuck.

421
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,330
- Help! Help me!
- Oh. Jesus!

422
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:45,029
Go round. Go round.

423
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,808
Has he gone? The man in the truck?

424
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,844
Yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah. he has.

425
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,141
Are you okay?

426
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,079
Oh. Jesus Christ.

427
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,579
Were you in that truck?

428
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,051
Right. listen. You've got to help me.

429
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,782
Was my girlfriend in there?

430
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:07,258
She's blond. Her name's Beth.

431
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,489
Come on. was there anyone
in that truck like that?

432
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,361
She's got blond hair.

433
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,695
- Right. I've got to follow it.
- What?

434
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:17,429
I've got to.
My girlfriend's in the back of that truck!

435
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:20,598
- Shouldn't we call the police?
- Yeah. yeah. you call them.

436
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,040
Haven't you called them yet?
- No. I can't.

437
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,543
They think I killed someone.

438
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:25,805
There's no signal.

439
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,949
Oh. fuck it.

440
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:31,186
How did you get out?

441
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:34,322
I saw that the back was open
and I just ran.

442
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,082
Would've tried getting others out.

443
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,750
- But here were locks on the cages.
- Is Beth all right? My girlfriend Beth?

444
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,225
I think so.

445
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,166
Oh. no. Shit.

446
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:46,960
Which way?

447
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,459
What's that?
- What?

448
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:51,435
I think I saw some lights up there.

449
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,972
No. please!

450
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,719
Leo. listen to me.
Please. don't hang up.

451
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,882
The battery's going
and Beth's gone missing.

452
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:14,094
No. no. she's been taken
by someone in a white truck.

453
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:17,664
So I need you to call the police and...
Hello?

454
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,499
Hello?

455
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,698
No signal.

456
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:28,034
Come on.

457
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:29,973
Come on.

458
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,105
What's wrong? What happened?

459
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,407
What are you doing?

460
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,486
Please.

461
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:23,756
We've got to get out of here.

462
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,032
Please.

463
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,542
Come on.

464
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,043
Come on. try that phone again.

465
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,509
The battery's dead.

466
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,653
The battery's dead. Did you hear me?

467
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,315
What are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do?

468
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,025
What are you doing?

469
00:50:58,321 --> 00:50:59,959
What are you doing?

470
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,727
I saw a house further back.

471
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,894
It had lights on.

472
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,234
The truck? Your girlfriend?

473
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,639
We've got no phone.
We're almost out of petrol.

474
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,940
I say we go back to that house.
See if they've got a car we can use.

475
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:15,913
Or a phone.
And then you can call the police.

476
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,290
Please. do you have a phone
we can use?

477
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,725
There's been an accident.

478
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:11,836
I'm sorry to disturb you.
But something's happened

479
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:14,134
and we need to use your phone.

480
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:20,508
Please. we just wanna call the police.

481
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:30,481
Dotty. show her where the phone is.

482
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,688
This way.

483
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:46,507
Do you have a toilet I could use?
- Yes. there's one upstairs. I'll show you.

484
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,076
You are cold. aren't you?

485
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:50,973
I'll fetch you a cardigan.

486
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:54,844
Well. what happened to you?

487
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,582
You don't wanna know.

488
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,589
Bloody dog.

489
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:13,231
Here's your ball. Humphrey.

490
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,110
I brought you a cup of tea.

491
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:28,179
That looks nasty.
That needs a bandage.

492
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:31,148
John will show you where they are.

493
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:37,054
Just do it. And I'll get you a cup of tea.

494
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:39,685
Yes.

495
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:42,257
We need the police.

496
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:43,625
No.

497
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,734
I was kidnapped by a man in a truck.

498
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,962
Yes.

499
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,904
I'm at a farm.

500
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,402
I don't know. It was white.

501
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,237
Oh. God.

502
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,983
Can you send someone over. please?

503
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,910
It's urgent.

504
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,188
The address?

505
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,121
They need the address.

506
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:16,627
Berylton Farm. Sandyhill Road.

507
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:20,563
It's Berylton Farm. Sandyhill Road.

508
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:24,729
Please. please. hurry. officer. Goodbye.

509
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,770
Thank you.

510
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,608
They said they're on their way.

511
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:37,249
I'll just take John his tea.

512
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:00,168
<i>It's me. It's not my phone.</i>

513
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:03,140
<i>It's his. I took it.</i>

514
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:04,878
<i>I'm at some farm.</i>

515
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:08,016
<i>You need to come and get me.</i>

516
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:10,611
Just an old couple.

517
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,152
Bloody dog.

518
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:21,222
I know I was. I'm sorry.

519
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:23,330
But he turned round.

520
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,397
But I can take care of him now.

521
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,569
What?

522
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,033
Well. why not?

523
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,139
Hello?

524
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,002
Shit.

525
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:02,465
Dotty. can you look at the fuses?

526
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,568
Dotty.

527
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,957

No. I didn't kill... No.

563
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,473
But I followed the guy who did
to some...

01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,621
I don't know where the fuck I am.
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,256
But can you trace this call?

566
