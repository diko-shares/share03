00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:10,020
You Don't Know Jack

2
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:54,170
<i>Man: You know, she
had that same look</i>

3
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:55,972
<i>Of agony on her face,</i>

4
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:57,240
<i>Just like mother.</i>

5
00:02:57,274 --> 00:02:59,943
<i>The same one mother
had, you know?</i>

6
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:02,012
<i>- Woman: Yeah.
- Man: You bore witness to it.</i>

7
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:04,347
Excruciating,

8
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:06,483
Awful waiting.

9
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:08,585
She was
struggling to die.

10
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:11,888
Yeah, well, it's not
living, you know.

11
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:14,190
<i>- Woman: No.
- It's not being alive.</i>

12
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:18,762
You know, they started doing
this in europe already,

13
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:20,797
But not here.

14
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:22,799
- Really?
- Yeah.

15
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,269
- Holland.
- Holland.

16
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:27,804
Never here.

17
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:30,206
<i>Way too puritanical here.</i>

18
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:33,710
I don't know why I didn't
think of this sooner.

19
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:35,545
I was limiting myself.

20
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,981
It'll be your own field
of specialty, jack.

21
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:41,017
You're gonna need some
business cards, you know?

22
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,832
We'll be swinging
singles again,

23
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,834
Just like when
we were in our prime.

24
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:00,136
Remember those two
nurses we were dating?

25
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,205
Two nurses?

26
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,875
Oh, that was me, not you.
Scratch that.

27
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,877
You know, you could
grab a box, jack.

28
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:09,646
- It wouldn't hurt you.
- Well, I'll get the door

29
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,715
Then I'll--
I'll come back out.

30
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:15,885
Yeah, the best thing about
living in my storage room--

31
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,954
( sniffs )
ain't bad--

32
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:19,355
It's a short commute.

33
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,224
( sniffs )
ain't bad.

34
00:04:26,997 --> 00:04:29,599
<i>- ( engine stops ) -
( car door opens )</i>

35
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:42,979
You left
your varsity jacket,

36
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:45,415
Your grandmother's afghan and
your nose hair clippers.

37
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,051
That's the last time I'm cleaning
up after you, neal nicol.

38
00:04:48,085 --> 00:04:50,186
Hi, jack.

39
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:57,227
<i>- I remember her being much
happier at your wedding.</i>

40
00:04:57,261 --> 00:04:58,661
Cut.

41
00:04:58,696 --> 00:05:00,964
- Ante up.
- Yes, dear.

42
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:02,966
<i>- ( coins rattle )
- I'm in.</i>

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,902
<i>Oh, by the way,
neal, mazel tov.</i>

44
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:08,104
You're gonna bean ex here soon.
How's it feel?

45
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,374
Like losing 138 lbs
without having to diet.

46
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:12,909
( guys laugh )

47
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:17,213
Obitiatry, stan.
The doctoring of death.

48
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:19,649
What,
in suicide clinics?

49
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:22,118
Really? I'm a doctor.
You want me exiled to boca raton?

50
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:25,255
Come on.Come on.
Planned death is gaining acceptance

51
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:26,890
All over the world.
Why not here?

52
00:05:26,924 --> 00:05:28,892
Can we, for christ's sakes,
just play cards, please?

53
00:05:28,926 --> 00:05:31,528
Because you can't put those
decisions in the hands of patients.

54
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:33,163
Well, whose hands are
we gonna put 'em in?

55
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:34,998
Doctoring's a healing profession.
I can't even--

56
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:36,866
Doctoring's
a death profession too.

57
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,269
Medicine, medicide.

58
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:41,638
- Cards, stan?
- Uh, three.

59
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:44,407
That's 10 in a row.
That's 10 in a row he folds.

60
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,543
You know you're allowed
to bluff once in a while.

61
00:05:46,577 --> 00:05:49,913
- I don't bluff.
- The guy is a study in pure non-fiction.

62
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:51,848
- Let him alone.
- Yeah.

63
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:55,685
You know I love you, jack, but most of
your colleagues think you're a nut.

64
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:58,021
Remember they used to call you
the "screwball pathologist"?

65
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:00,957
<i>Would you save me the schpilkes and
stay retired for crying out loud?</i>

66
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:02,559
I'm not retired.

67
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:05,028
Retired means one is
no longer occupied

68
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:06,429
With one's profession.

69
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:09,833
I may be unemployed,
but I am occupied.

70
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:12,502
- Stan: Eight.
- King high. It's yours.

71
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:17,073
- And it's your deal.
- I know it.

72
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:19,442
- What?
- My-- my hands are grea.

73
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:23,379
- With what?
- I have pizza fingers.

74
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:25,281
- Pizza fingers?
- You ever hear of them?

75
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:28,351

He's being kept alive against his wishes.

Uh-huh.
How's about $10?

107
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:10,887
You know, this is
what you do it for,

108
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:15,024
To be able to put your
stamp on medical history.

109

00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:23,059
I understand that.
I'm not asking you to comment on politics.

134
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:24,861
I'm asking you if you've
had any communication

135
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:27,797
With the prosecutor's office.

We have a monumental

To not only...

143
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:53,456
End your own suffering

144
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,958
But to give
your death a meaning.

145
00:09:55,993 --> 00:09:58,027
By providing your organs

146
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:00,229
To more useful citizens,

147
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:02,598
You will be
benefitting society...

148
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:04,734
Immeasurably.

149
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:07,070
Just so you know,

150
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:09,138
We're gonna offer them up

151
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:12,675

Now...

154
00:10:18,415 --> 00:10:19,816
I don't know
if you know this,

155
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,885
But I cannot give you
the injection myself.

156
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,220
It's illegal.

157
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:27,457
But you can release
these solutions

158
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:30,693
On your own.

159
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:35,331

161
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:40,470
This is gonna
put you to sleep

162
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:42,538
<i>And set off this timer.</i>

163
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:47,376
You'll fall
into a deep coma

164
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:51,414
As the lethal dose of
potassium chloride

165
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:53,382
Stops your heart.

166
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:57,487
Uh, I know you have
no motor skills,

167
00:10:57,521 --> 00:11:00,289
So I added this.

168
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:06,229
You can move you head
slightly side to side.

169
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:08,698
Don't do it now, but
I'm gonna place this

170
00:11:08,732 --> 00:11:10,366
Between your teeth.

171
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:14,537
Put it in
and move your head.

172
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:17,773
Very simple-- move
your head side to side

173
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:20,276
Just a little bit
and it goes.

174
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,080
- the time comes, you just let
your teeth do all the work.

175
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:27,250
- ( alarm beeping ) -
this is outrageous.

176
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:29,252
- Jack: No it's not.
- Get that thing out of here now.

177
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:31,287
- He's just receiving new information...
- Jack.

178
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:34,924
...So he's bound to react.
Just give him a chance to calm himself.

179
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,926
Could you just give him a
chance to calm himself?

180
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,128
Please leave immediately
of I'll call security

181
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:40,963
<i>And have you thrown out.</i>

182
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:43,566
<i>- Please leave.
- I'm sorry, david.</i>

183
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,935
I don't need
your security.

184
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:48,271
- Certainly don't need that.
- Get it out of here.

185
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:50,139
David, I'm sorry
for this upset.

186
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,074
<i>Man:
Doctor, please.</i>

187
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:54,644
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Man: And take that thing with you.</i>

188
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:03,386
<i>Lessenberry: It took a
couple more months,</i>

189
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,822
<i>But the doctors finally did allow him
to be taken off of life support.</i>

190
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:08,324
And what
a brutal way he went.

191
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:11,360
- Brutal? - Brutal.
Think about it.

192
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:14,030
Is it really any different
than what the germans did

193
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:16,499
- In nazi germany?
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

194
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,201
- Hmm?
- Do you want me to print that?

195
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:21,037
- Print what you want.
- We're talking about hospitals,

196
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:23,239
<i>- Not nazis.
- Well, they do the same thing--</i>

197
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:25,308
Starving people to death.
They cut off their feeding

198
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:27,276
And their water
and they let them die.

199
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:29,245
And it's all legal.

200
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,948
The United States supreme
court has validated

201
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:33,849
The nazi method
of execution.

202
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,118
<i>( lessenberry laughs
) excuse me.</i>

203
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:38,988
You-- you obviously don't
approve of the current method.

204
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:40,489
No, I don't.
Do you?

205
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:43,492
Starving people to death?
No, I don't think so.

206
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:45,461
It's inhumane.

207
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:47,563
If a person's
allowed to die,

208
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:50,600
Then you inject them--
painlessly, quickly.

209
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:52,535
You don't let them
wither away.

210
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:54,237
It's inconceivable.

211
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:56,072
It's unspeakable.

212
00:12:56,106 --> 00:12:59,575
What would you charge
for this procedure?

213
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,114
You don't charge people

214
00:13:05,148 --> 00:13:07,250
For mething like this, mr.
Lessenberry.

215
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:08,918
What's wrong with you?

216
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:14,056
You-- you've really got
some story here, doc.

217
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:16,692
Don't be surprised if this
gets picked up nationally.

218
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:18,828
Is your turkey okay?

219
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:21,597
I don't like fat.

220
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:23,766
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

221
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,642
Selfish bastard.

222
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:35,244
You hog all the ink in
the detroit papers,

223
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,014
Now you're in "newsweek"

224
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:40,016
<i>And there's
nothing about me.</i>

225
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,517
<i>- Oh.
- What about me?</i>

226
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:44,053
Look at this.
Man.

227
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:46,956
"blunt and feisty, he's
the first american doctor

228
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,258
To advocate
physician-assisted suicide."

229
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:51,294
They're gonna have to
take me seriously now.

230
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:53,863
- You're not a local quack anymore.
- No no.

231
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:56,165
- You're america's quack.
- America's quack!

232
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:57,867
- ( laughs )
- look at this.

233
00:13:57,901 --> 00:14:00,036
You earned it.

234
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,204
Congratulations.

235
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,808
- Neal, congratulations.
- "newsweek" magazine.

236
00:14:05,842 --> 00:14:08,544
So how are
we gonna celebrate?

237
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:11,547
Uh, you want
a glass of water?

238
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:15,251
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Great!

239
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:31,567
<i>Jack: So when were
you first diagnosed</i>

240
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:33,202
With alzheimer's, mrs.
Adkins?

241
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:35,838
<i>Mrs. Adkins: About a
year ago I think.</i>

242
00:14:35,872 --> 00:14:39,542
It was
three years ago now.

243
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:43,245
Oh.
And what did your doctor say

244
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,215
- When he told you?
- Well, it was like a bomb.

245
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:49,018
He said
she had alzheimer's

246
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:52,054
And it'd come to a point

247
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:53,789
Where she wouldn't
be able to...

248
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:55,524
( cries )

249
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,792
( exhales deeply )

250
00:14:56,827 --> 00:14:58,828
- There is-- - ...D
ress herself.

251
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,996
She wouldn't be able
to take a bath.

252
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:04,600
<i>Jack: What-- what are some of
the other fears you have?</i>

253
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:09,171
That I wouldn't know
that this is my husband

254
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,476
And my children,

255
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,178
<i>Or "who am I?
"</i>

256
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:20,015
<i>Jack: You're sensing
the loss of things.</i>

257
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,952
Loss loss
loss loss loss.

258
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:25,521
So let's talk
about that if you could.

259
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:30,025
What happened today,
for instance?

260
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,396
- What happened today? - You tell me.
I don't even know what happened today.

261
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,299
She went out
into the yard and then--

262
00:15:39,202 --> 00:15:41,337
What I could see was

263
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:43,706
She stood there
in the yard

264
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,276
And I could see
from behind her

265
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,312
That she didn't know
where she was.

266
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:52,782
She didn't know
to turn around,

267
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,917
That was the bacdoor
of the hwuse.

268
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:58,687
She didn't know that that was the
gate to go out to the street.

269
00:15:58,722 --> 00:16:01,190
She just-- she didn't
know what to do.

270
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:03,325
<i>Jack:
Mm-hmm.</i>

271
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,194
I don't remember.

272
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:07,530
<i>Jack on tv: When I
talked to your doctor--</i>

273
00:16:07,564 --> 00:16:09,532
<i>First of all, he would
hardly speak with me.</i>

274
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:10,933
<i>But when he did,</i>

275
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:12,735
What your doctor was trying
to communicate to me

276
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:15,538
<i>Was that you're not
imminently terminal.</i>

277
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,773
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I--I-- I understand.

278
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:21,210
<i>- And I understand-- - margo:
Should I make some tea for us?</i>

279
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:23,879
<i>- Jack?
- Thats frightening.</i>

280
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:27,349
<i>- Jack, do you want some tea?
- If I don't make this decision right now,</i>

281
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:29,485
<i>I'll never be able to.</i>

282
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,154
Margo, I don't know
what we're doing.

283
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:34,123
Look at her.

284
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:36,025
Look at her.

285
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:39,528
She looks well to me.

286
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:43,265
She looks
quite capable, no?

287
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,001
She's not
the right one.

288
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:48,137
But she has the right.

289
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:50,906
As a patient,

290
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:52,374
It's her choice.

291
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:54,276
I refuse to die
a slow death.

292
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:56,879
<i>Margo: Come on, jack.
You know how things are gonna be perceived.</i>

293
00:16:56,913 --> 00:16:58,981
- I don't care.
- The media's gonna all over it.

294
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:01,183
- I know. - You're gonna
have to tell her yes.

295
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:03,185
- I know.
- You have to be strategic.

296
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,154
Margo, what do we
care about the media?

297
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:07,022
<i>Who cares?</i>

298
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:09,992
Look.
Sometimes in life

299
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:12,294
There are strategies
that you have to take,

300
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,197
Because we have to be very
careful about our purpose.

301
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:17,800
- Our purpose is important.
- Well, what about her?!

302
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,401
Who cares
what people think?

303
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:22,838
<i>It's what
my patient feels.</i>

304
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:26,208
She doesn't know each day
what she's gonna find

305
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:28,077
When she looks
in the mirror.

306
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:30,846
She doesn't know if she's gonna
see herself there anymore.

307
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:33,015
<i>This is her terror.</i>

308
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:36,252
This is what she goes through,
day in and day out.

309
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:39,388
The terror of being...

310
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,092
Lost.

311
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:48,197
- Jack.
- She's running out of time.

312
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:50,332
I understand that.

313
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:53,869
Look at me.

314
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:57,306
<i>If it was me,
if I was her,</i>

315
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,175
If I was in the same
situation, would you do it?

316
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,877
- You, margo?
- Yes, me, margo.

317
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:03,412
<i>- Would you do it for me?
- Of course I'd do it. Yes</i>

318
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:05,314
<i>- You would do it?
You know that? - Sure.</i>

319
00:18:05,348 --> 00:18:09,251
<i>If I saw the same look of
determination in your eyes</i>

320
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:12,187
As I saw in hers,
of course I'd do it.

321
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:14,657
No question about it.

322
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:17,560
My own sister--
in truth, I'd do it.

323
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:19,328
<i>- You'd do it?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

324
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:21,263
That's your answer.

325
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:23,799
Yeah, I know.

326
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,335
I just wanted to work
this through, you know?

327
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:28,537
Just go through
the variables.

328
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:31,840
<i>- Mrs. Adkins: "who am I?
" - jack on tv: And you're aware of your decision?</i>

329
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:35,244
<i>- Mrs. Adkins: Yes.
- Let 'em come after me.</i>

330
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:37,913
Let 'em come after

<i>Mrs. Adkins: ...
The end of my life.</i>

332
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:44,386
I think I'm gonna make
us some tea right now.

333
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:46,388
Make it strong,
will you?

334
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:50,092
<i>- Margo: Yeah. - Jack on tv: ...
The word for "the end of life."</i>

335

- Margo: By the way...</i>

336
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:53,495
<i>Jack on tv: This

337
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,933
<i>- Yes. Yes, I do. - ...
Where are we gonna do this?</i>

338
00:18:57,968 --> 00:19:01,737
Woman: Some people think we
brew up poisonous potions

339
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:03,272
Like witches
from gallows hill.

340
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:05,507
<i>Others think it's "take
two hemlock pills</i>

341
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,176
And meet your maker
in the morning."

342
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,677
Well, surprise surprise--

343
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:11,146
There's no such thing
as a hemlock pill.

344
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:15,017
<i>We offer assistance</i>

345
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:16,652

Wills, hospice care,

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,892
But we do not
dispense drugs,

349
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:25,828
We do not pull plugs.

350
00:19:25,862 --> 00:19:29,231
We started this chapter
because we believe

351
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:32,368
That to each person, their
own way of death...

352
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,471
<i>With dignity.</i>

00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:37,506
Jack:
Oh, miss good,

354
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,074
I can carry
that for you.

355
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:41,710
That would've been nice, dr.
Kevorkian,

356
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,746
But it's a little late
now, don't you think?

357
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,581
And it's "missus.
"

358
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:47,783
- Missus?
- Yup.

359
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,718
Oh.
Good.

360
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:52,421
So-- so you know
who I am?

361
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:54,223
What do I look like,
June cleaver?

362
00:19:54,257 --> 00:19:56,258
What can
I do for you?

363
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:58,594
Well, uh...

364
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:00,596
I, umm--

365
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,197
I have
my first patient,

366
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:05,634
- But what I don't have...
- Is a place.

367
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:09,672
<i>- Yes. - And you'd
like to use my home?</i>

368
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:13,008
<i>- ( engine starts )
- well, no.</i>

369
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:14,510
I thought
you would know a place,

370
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:17,513
But if I could use your home,
that would be just fine.

371
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:19,782
- Sure. - Well, if you're
gonna come to my home,

372
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:21,850
You're gonna have to
dress more cheerfully.

373
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,192
( clacks )

374
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:33,996
If you've never actually
tested that before,

375
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,731
How do you know
it's gonna work?

376
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:38,300
Because I made it.

377
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:41,070
I wish you had a stronger
argument than that.

378
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:42,838
( chuckles )

379
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:46,542
Hey, whatever I can do to lend
a hand tomorrow, let me know.

380
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:50,179
Oh, on this one, neal,

381
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:51,814
This first one,

382
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:54,383
I want it
to be me and margo.

383
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,086
<i>- Just us.
- ( phone ringing )</i>

384
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,760
Am I hearing a phone

385
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:06,862
Or is it my...?

386
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:13,268
I've gotta remember to
install one by the couch.

387
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:14,636
Your house.

388
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:17,940
<i>Dr. Kevorkian's.

390
00:21:20,577 --> 00:21:22,644
<i>Janet good.</i>

391
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:27,049
- Ooh, there we go.
- Hey, janet.

392
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,951
<i>Janet: I don't know how to say
this, so I'm just gonna say it.</i>

393
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:32,621
<i>I'm sorry.
I know it's the last minute,</i>

394
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:36,291
But my husband ray-- he's
a retired police captain

395
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:38,627
And he feels
very strongly

396
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:40,429
That we can't use
our house.

397
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:42,297
<i>- He feels that it would put us at risk.
- Jack: Are you kidding me?</i>

398
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:44,299
<i>Lady, are you kidding me?</i>

399
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:46,368
I've got margo
at the airport

400
00:21:46,402 --> 00:21:48,337
Picking these
people up as we speak.

401
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:51,340
<i>- You can't do this to me.
- Oh. Yeah, well,</i>

402
00:21:51,374 --> 00:21:53,442
I could make
some other suggestions.

403
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:56,545
There's nothing further to
be gained by talking to you.

404
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:02,417
What now?

405
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:07,990
Call the whole thing off?

406
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:12,194

414
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,127
Margo's going to

415
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:48,063
Take me
to the airport shortly.

416
00:22:49,532 --> 00:22:51,533
It's best for me
to go home,

417
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:58,207
Should anything happen
with the police later on.

418
00:22:58,241 --> 00:23:00,242
Yes.

419
00:23:46,623 --> 00:23:48,557
Jack: Okay.

Mrs. Adkins: Our gardener
comes on Thursday.

He's going
to plant marigolds.

423
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:07,175
Marigolds protect
the garden.

424
00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:14,383
It's not too late, my dear.
You know?

425
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:16,752
We can stop right now.

426
00:24:16,786 --> 00:24:19,755
You wouldn't offend me.

427
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,026
Do you understand?
You wouldn't offend me.

428
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:34,703
Tell me when
to flip the switch.

429
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:50,452

<i>How dare he call

446
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:51,640
What can we charge him with?
The medical examiner said

447
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:53,642
He had no choice but
to rule it a suicide.

448
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:56,511
I just can't stop
thinking about yesterday,

How it all went.

450
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:03,118
I guess somehow I just
thought the whole thing

451
00:27:03,152 --> 00:27:04,686
Would be nicer.

452
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,521
Could be nicer?

00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:08,790
- Yeah.
- How, "nicer"?

454
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:12,194
Does this look like
compassion to you, david?

455
00:27:12,228 --> 00:27:14,029
Compassion?

00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:17,032
He kills a woman and he
calls it compassion?

You're gonna get him.

Yes.

It's rum raisin.

I don't understand wigs,

Let me tell you something
about dick thompson.

00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:31,773
He may be a card-carrying
member of the religious right,

483

<i>But he doesn't have a pot to piss
in, charging jack with murder.</i>

484
00:28:35,244 --> 00:28:36,578
He didn't kill anyone.

<i>Nullum crimen, nulla

486

mcnally, the district judge,

489
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:50,892
And no way in hell is he
gonna let this move forward.

490
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:53,094
<i>But understand, these

491
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:55,964
Everything under the sun to
stop you from doing this again.

492
00:28:55,998 --> 00:28:57,832
They have no recourse
to stop me.

494
00:29:01,737 --> 00:29:05,106

- Why? - Good.
Good.

496
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:10,111
Well, you see, courtrooms

<i>If we show your patients
pleading for your help,</i>

That's your
golden ticket.

500

- Man: Yeah.</i>

508
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,578
<i>- I can't afford to pay you.
- Man: Oh, you don't have to pay me.</i>

509
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:45,180
<i>I'll do it for free.</i>

510
00:29:45,214 --> 00:29:47,482
Let them keep trying to
prove this is a crime,

511
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:50,151
And we'll keep proving
it's a civil rights issue.

512
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:53,922
So that do you think?

513
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:56,191
She's a good judge
of character.

514
00:29:56,225 --> 00:29:57,959
That's a wig
she's wearing.

515
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:02,330
- Oh.
- Rum raisin.

516
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:05,600
- Jack.
( laughs ) - I like it.

517
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:09,204
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

518
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:12,407
<i>Jack: The-- "the
morning drive show"?</i>

519
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:15,143
<i>Lessenberry: Yeah, he wanted me to ask
you if you'd come on as a guest.</i>

520
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:18,647
It's on 6:00 to 10:00 in the morning.
It's got a big audience.

521
00:30:18,681 --> 00:30:20,815
You know, people driving
to work listen to it.

522
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:27,055
He keeps it pretty light.
Well, I never heard of it,ord.

523
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:28,623
But I'll do it, sure.

524
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:32,694
<i>âª black, white, red, brown,
feel the vibration...âª</i>

525
00:30:32,728 --> 00:30:35,463
<i>Man: Good morning, everybody.
This is "the bob bender show,"</i>

526
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:38,166
"the morning drive show.
" today it's a special edition--

527
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,871
<i>It's "the morning die show," because of
my special guest, dr. Jack kevorkian.</i>

528
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:45,006
<i>He's a local boy from
here in "de-troit."</i>

529
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,776
You might know him better as dr.
Death.

530
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:51,212
<i>I like to say he is the last
doctor you will ever need.</i>

531
00:30:51,247 --> 00:30:54,349
I actually heard somebody refer to you as dr.
Frankenstein the other day

532
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:57,952
<i>Because of your rather active
organ-procurement program.</i>

533
00:30:57,987 --> 00:31:00,588
Well, I'm gonna take
that as a compliment,

534
00:31:00,623 --> 00:31:03,525
Because anyone who's read
the story of frankenstein

535
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:07,529
Knows that he was
a benevolent man

536
00:31:07,563 --> 00:31:11,399
And it was society who
made the monster bad.

537
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:13,902
<i>Bob: Well, I find it
impossible to believe,</i>

538
00:31:13,936 --> 00:31:16,504
But our lines are lighting
up and my producer tells me

539
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:19,574
40% to 50% of our callers
say "heyyou're right."

540
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:22,877
So maybe I shouldn't go on.
Let's quit while I'm ahead.

541
00:31:22,912 --> 00:31:25,580
- Well, don't die on me now, doc.
- No no no.

542
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:28,516
Sorry, I had to say that.
Tell me a little bit about your mercitron,

543
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:31,152
<i>- Something I hope the-- - see?
He's doing good.</i>

544
00:31:31,187 --> 00:31:34,689
- Yeah.
- Sharp as a tack.

545
00:31:34,724 --> 00:31:38,593
<i>Jack over radio: It's good that
people realize what's at stake here.</i>

546
00:31:38,627 --> 00:31:41,529
I me,
self-determination is

547
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:43,631
A basic human right

548
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:46,468
And everyone
should have it.

549
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:49,037
By flipping the switch
on your suicide machine,

550
00:31:49,071 --> 00:31:51,272
<i>- Kind of like hitting this button here.
- ( button clicks )</i>

551
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:55,910
Well, sure,
or carbon monoxide,

552
00:31:55,945 --> 00:31:59,247
<i>Which actually is a
quicker procedure.</i>

553
00:31:59,281 --> 00:32:01,116
<i>And I can assure you
as a pathologist</i>

554
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,719
Gas inhalation always
leaves the deceased

555
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:07,288
With a rosy,
colorful afterglow.

556
00:32:07,323 --> 00:32:09,791
<i>Bob: Well, hopefully our
listeners aren't listening</i>

557
00:32:09,825 --> 00:32:12,827
In their garages this morning.
If they are, open the door.

558
00:32:12,862 --> 00:32:16,531
<i>( evil laugh ) we're getting
rather ghoulish here</i>

559
00:32:16,565 --> 00:32:20,268
<i>At 7:55 in the morning.
You are live with bob bender</i>

560
00:32:20,302 --> 00:32:22,303
And I hesitate
to say "ve," doctor,

561
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:24,973
Because we're talking death with dr.
Death.

562
00:32:25,007 --> 00:32:27,675
And if you want to end it, call dr.
Kevorkian

563
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,746
<i>- That's k-e-v-o-r-k-I-a-n.
- Jack: This is not an ad.</i>

564
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:33,681
<i>I just don't want to give
the wrong impression.</i>

565
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:36,484
<i>I am not here advertising.
I'm-- I'm--</i>

566
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,653
<i>( tools clinking )</i>

567
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,102
<i>- Hi, there.
- ( ratchet clicks )</i>

568
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:58,440
Oh, no.
Not you, lady.

569
00:32:58,474 --> 00:33:00,775
- Oh, stop it. Stop it.
- Stay away from me, lady.

570
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,812
I don't bite.
I'm sorry I backed out on you that way,

571
00:33:03,846 --> 00:33:06,014
But that's water under the bridge.
I think we need to have a conversation.

572
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,016
- Water under the bridge?
- Yeah.

573
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,119
I ended up using my v.
W. Van in the park.

574
00:33:11,153 --> 00:33:12,754
<i>Water under the bridge?</i>

575
00:33:12,788 --> 00:33:14,689
That was very
resourceful of you.

576
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:18,626
- Oh, thank you. - I know that you're
upset, but you have to let it go.

577
00:33:18,661 --> 00:33:20,728
We need to have
a bigger conversation.

578
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:23,965
And that's
a much better sweater.

579
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:26,234
<i>It's more cheerful.</i>

580
00:33:27,336 --> 00:33:29,103
<i>( knife clinking )</i>

581
00:33:29,138 --> 00:33:31,606
<i>Jack: You know, I don't get
many visitors up here,</i>

582
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:35,176
Women especially.

583
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:38,446
With your charms,
I'm shoed.

584
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:42,417
I hope you like it.

585
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:46,554
- I made it just for you.
- Thank you.

586
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:51,893
You know, doc, you
have to stop pushing

587
00:33:51,927 --> 00:33:53,661
For organ donations.

588
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:57,732
It'd be better if you just
focused on one thing at a time.

589
00:33:58,968 --> 00:34:00,768
That sounds like
it comes straight ou

590
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:03,905
Of the old
hemlock society playbook.

591
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:06,307
I'm the first to admit
hemlock has its faults.

592
00:34:06,342 --> 00:34:08,543
<i>That's why I'm here.
That's why I agree</i>

593
00:34:08,577 --> 00:34:11,646
That it should be self-determination
without compromise.

594
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,882
And for the record,
I also agree

595
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:16,184
That "terminally ill"
is an undefinable term.

596
00:34:16,218 --> 00:34:19,687
So I say establish
your criteria--

597
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:22,857
You know, multiple doctor
examinations, psych assessments--

598
00:34:22,892 --> 00:34:27,462
Make sure that all physical
treatments have been exhausted

599
00:34:27,496 --> 00:34:31,432
And maybe the blessing of a
priest or a rabbi would be good.

600
00:34:33,536 --> 00:34:36,538
Funny. My mom used to make these
for us, only with a pickle

601
00:34:37,573 --> 00:34:39,140
And no crusts.

602
00:34:39,174 --> 00:34:41,109
Sorry about the crust.

603
00:34:41,143 --> 00:34:43,278
I usually cut them off,

604
00:34:43,312 --> 00:34:46,281
But somehow I thought
you'd like crust.

605
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:52,954
She was tortured in a nursing
home till the day she died--

606
00:34:52,988 --> 00:34:56,391
Mind gone, bed sores the
size of dinner plates.

607
00:34:56,425 --> 00:34:58,993
If you looked in them,
you could see her spine.

608
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,864
Who was it for you?
Your mother?

609
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:05,433
Your father?

610
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:08,303
I don't see any pictures
anywhere of anybody.

611
00:35:10,472 --> 00:35:13,641
You know, maybe you're right,
what you said before.

612
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,879
One thing at a time.

613
00:35:20,816 --> 00:35:22,450
Fair enough.

614
00:35:22,484 --> 00:35:24,252
So, umm...

615
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:27,322
I was snooping around
a little bit.

616
00:35:27,356 --> 00:35:30,358
- Oh yeah.
- Can you tell me

617
00:35:30,392 --> 00:35:34,395
About marjorie wantz
and sherry miller?

618
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:38,499
Sure. Ms.
Miller has m.S.

619
00:35:38,534 --> 00:35:40,401
<i>And she's had it
for a decade.</i>

620
00:35:40,436 --> 00:35:42,670
<i>She has hardly a
motor skill left.</i>

621
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:46,374
<i>Her husband took off a month
after the diagnosis.</i>

622
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:50,244
<i>And we've got mrs.
Wantz who has severe pelvic pain.</i>

623
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:52,981
<i>She's had 10 operations,
all for naught.</i>

624
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:54,849
<i>The pain's completely
debilitating.</i>

625
00:35:54,883 --> 00:35:58,219
I've thought
about it a long time.

626
00:35:58,253 --> 00:36:00,421
A long time.

627
00:36:00,456 --> 00:36:02,357
Yeah, I have,

628
00:36:02,391 --> 00:36:05,793
And I have no qualms

629
00:36:05,828 --> 00:36:07,795
<i>About my decision.</i>

630
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,664
<i>I could do it tonight.</i>

631
00:36:09,698 --> 00:36:12,133
<i>Jack:
What is it you want?</i>

632
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:16,270
<i>- Put it in plain english.
- Yeah, I want-- I want to die.</i>

633
00:36:16,305 --> 00:36:19,941
<i>- Jack: That's plain enough.
- Yup. Yup.</i>

634
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:24,912
You don't wanna have one more
thanksgiving with your kids?

635
00:36:24,947 --> 00:36:26,914
No no no.

636
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:29,717
I just want it
over quick.

637
00:36:31,353 --> 00:36:33,321
I have no fear.

638
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:35,556
<i>Marjorie:
I have tried, myself,</i>

639
00:36:35,591 --> 00:36:38,159
<i>Three different times and
I have not succeeded.</i>

640
00:36:38,193 --> 00:36:41,562
I tried it,
as you know, with the car.

641
00:36:41,597 --> 00:36:44,132
- Mm-hmm.
- I put the hose on the exhaust

642
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,833
And into the window.

643
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:48,169
I stayed in the car
over three hours

644
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:51,172
And I tried it three times.
Nothing happened.

645
00:36:51,206 --> 00:36:53,675
I get a half hour, an
hour sleep at night

646
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:56,144
With all the pills and
slping pills I take.

647
00:36:56,178 --> 00:36:59,614
And it's--
when you've got no quality

648
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:01,582
Of life left,

649
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:04,318
It's-- no.
No more.

650
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:07,755
If I do one of you,

651
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,692
There's a chance they'll
send me to jail.

652
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:13,528
I won't be able
to dthe other.

653
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,433
<i>( police radio chatter )</i>

What's next,

00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:41,589
- Right this way.
- Don't touch that.

00:37:41,623 --> 00:37:43,858
Jack: I'm gonna say all you
did was drive me up here.

Sir, it's just him we want.

<i>We're trying
to get in touch</i>

671
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:02,744
<i>With our correspondent
up at the scene there</i>

672
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:04,612
<i>About 40 miles
north of detroit.</i>

673
00:38:04,646 --> 00:38:06,681
<i>Details are sketchy.</i>

674
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:09,717
<i>- Again, it appears that dr.
Jack kevorkian... - Neal: Fieger!</i>

675
00:38:09,752 --> 00:38:13,688
<i>...Has indeed assisted a
double suicide this evening.</i>

676
00:38:13,722 --> 00:38:16,891
- Woman: Here we go.
- We're going to go live to the scene now

677
00:38:16,925 --> 00:38:18,926
<i>- And stay on the story.
- Man: Bobby!</i>

678
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:21,129
Fieger:
Where's jack?

679
00:38:21,163 --> 00:38:24,031
<i>- Man #2: Can you comment
on-- - this is ridiculous.</i>

680
00:38:24,066 --> 00:38:26,901
It's absurd.
No crime has been committed.

681
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:29,871
Release him.
Release him now.

682
00:38:29,905 --> 00:38:31,973
<i>Man #3:
Everybody settle down.</i>

683
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:34,408
<i>- ( people chattering ) -
fieger: Is this live?</i>

684
00:38:34,443 --> 00:38:35,843
- Dr. Kevorkian!
- This better be live.

685
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:37,945
- Can we get your statement, sir?
- Two very sick

686
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,048
But wonderful women died here
tonight by their own choosing.

687
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:43,885
Dr.
Kevorkian was only acting out

688
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:45,787
As-- as--
as their physician.

689
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:48,890
<i>He did not force anyone
to come up here.</i>

690
00:38:48,924 --> 00:38:52,193
<i>Mr. Thompson, if
you're watching,</i>

691
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:55,129
<i>Have the gall to charge dr.
Kevorkian tonight.</i>

692
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:58,332
Bring it on!
Do it tonight!

693
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:01,369
Reporters: Mr. Fieger! Mr.
Fieger! Dr. Kevorkian!

694
00:39:01,403 --> 00:39:03,771
( softly ) don't let
them do this to me.

695
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:07,074
( softly ) this is how you
play the media, jack.

696
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:09,844
Get ready to become the most
famous doctor in the country.

697
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:12,780
Isn't this murder?
Would you care

698
00:39:12,815 --> 00:39:14,515
To comment on the religious
aspects of this?

699
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,451
<i>Woman: What were they
suffering from?</i>

700
00:39:17,486 --> 00:39:19,587
( silent )

701
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:31,465
I need you to do your job, dr.
Dragovic,

702
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,034
<i>So I can do mine.</i>

703
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:36,971
Science itself gives us no
arguments, mr. Thompson.

704
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:45,479
<i>Man: That's the way
you're gonna do it.</i>

705
00:39:45,514 --> 00:39:47,648
<i>Jack: I told you I'm not
gonna touch your food.</i>

706
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:52,119
It would be an admission
of guilt, you know?

707
00:39:54,556 --> 00:39:57,658
I can go for weeks
without food,

708
00:39:57,693 --> 00:40:01,262
<i>- Like ghandi. - Fieger: You're
looking worse than ghandi, jack.</i>

709
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:03,731
<i>- Jack: Yeah.
- You look like one of your patients.</i>

710
00:40:03,765 --> 00:40:06,934
It's been three days.
Come on.

711
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:09,904
I'm not moving.
I'm not paying that bond.

712
00:40:09,938 --> 00:40:12,173
You don't have to.
I did.

713
00:40:12,207 --> 00:40:14,575
<i>- Come on, let's go.
- Jack: You didn't.</i>

714
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,978
You paid my bail?

715
00:40:17,012 --> 00:40:19,180
Yeah, I bailed you out.
Let's go.

716
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,650
What kind of lawyer
does that?

717
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:24,652
<i>What the matter
with you, geoff?</i>

718
00:40:24,686 --> 00:40:27,455
Don't you see I'm denying
myself nourishment?

719
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:29,957
I'm-- I'm--
I'm starving to death

720
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:32,460
For three days
to make a point.

721
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:34,729
- I get it. I get it.
- This is a protest.

722
00:40:34,763 --> 00:40:36,731
They violated my rights.

723
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:39,100
You're not supposed
to bail me out.

724
00:40:39,134 --> 00:40:40,935
It defeats the purpose.

725
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:43,004
Oh, I should fire you,
you know?

726
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:47,074
We're facing an indictment
on wantz and miller.

727
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:50,077
- Oh.
- Here.

728
00:40:50,112 --> 00:40:52,380
What's this?

729
00:40:52,414 --> 00:40:53,881
Pie.

730
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:56,250
This is full of fat and sugar.
Are you trying to kill me?

731
00:40:56,285 --> 00:40:58,085
Just eat
the fucking pie, jack.

732
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,288
<i>- ( groans ) - (
phone ringing )</i>

733
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:04,425
Oh, and another thing--

734
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,394
The state revoked
your medical license.

735
00:41:06,428 --> 00:41:09,764
Good. They took away
my career years ago.

736
00:41:09,798 --> 00:41:11,899
It didn't stop me,
did it?

737
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:15,236
Yeah, ll, it stops suppliers from
providing you with your poisons.

738
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,205
That's what
I've got neal for.

739
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:23,144
Fieger:
Where the hell
are you going?

740
00:41:23,178 --> 00:41:24,679
Jack:
Home.

741
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:26,280
Well, come on,
I'll give you a ride.

742
00:41:26,315 --> 00:41:28,749
- My car's up here.
- No, I need the exercise.

743
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:30,584
I need to get
the blood flowing.

744
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:32,920
We've got an offer
to fly to new york

745
00:41:32,955 --> 00:41:34,488
To do
the barbara walters show.

746
00:41:34,523 --> 00:41:37,658
Well, if barbara walters
wants me badly enough,

747
00:41:37,693 --> 00:41:38,926
She knows where
to find me.

748
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:40,628
Don't make this
complicated, jack.

749
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:42,997
<i>- Can't it.
- This is important.</i>

750
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,903
One too many passenger
rides in a f-86 sabre

751
00:41:48,937 --> 00:41:50,571
When I was
stationed in seoul.

752
00:41:50,605 --> 00:41:54,241
Flying scares the daylights
out of me, geoff.

753
00:41:55,177 --> 00:41:57,278
<i>Nighty night!</i>

754
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,548
<i>( classical score playing )</i>

755
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:34,181
<i>Barbara walters: Doctor,
let me be frank.</i>

756
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:37,318
<i>You're aware that people
think you are a ghoul?</i>

757
00:42:37,352 --> 00:42:39,453
It's emotionalism.

758
00:42:39,488 --> 00:42:43,124
When heart transplants
first started,

759
00:42:43,158 --> 00:42:46,460
There was the same
prevalent feeling,

760
00:42:46,495 --> 00:42:48,362
Even among doctors,
that it was wrong.

761
00:42:48,397 --> 00:42:51,165
<i>It was contrary
to god's will,</i>

762
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,800
<i>Contrary to nature.</i>

763
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:56,203
Isn't it
ghoulish to rip

764
00:42:56,238 --> 00:42:57,938
A person's chest open

765
00:42:57,973 --> 00:42:59,573
And take out a heart,

766
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:03,577
Or a bypass opation?

767
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:05,346
Ether is
the same thing.

768
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,015
You have ether, been
around for centuries--

769
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,017
It wasn't used,

770
00:43:10,052 --> 00:43:12,286
Not till 1846.

771
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,222
It was discovered in
1543, and before that

772
00:43:15,257 --> 00:43:18,759
Everybody was being operated
on while they were awake!

773
00:43:18,794 --> 00:43:21,629
Surgeons were cutting them
open while they were awake.

774
00:43:21,663 --> 00:43:22,930
Did you know that, geoff?

775
00:43:22,964 --> 00:43:25,900
- No. - Oh, yes.
And you know why it was banned?

776
00:43:25,934 --> 00:43:28,702
Because of religious dogma.

777
00:43:28,737 --> 00:43:31,405
Because
of the foolish notion

778
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,509
That there's a god almighty
who wills us to suffer.

779
00:43:35,544 --> 00:43:37,278
Do you turn
patients down?

780
00:43:37,312 --> 00:43:40,448
I turn-- 97% to 98%

781
00:43:40,482 --> 00:43:43,184
Of the patients who contact
me, I turn them down.

782
00:43:43,218 --> 00:43:45,519
Should there be
second opinions?

783
00:43:45,554 --> 00:43:48,289
Always a second opinion.
A third opinion. ( chuckles )

784
00:43:48,323 --> 00:43:51,592
- But there wasn't in your case.
- No, there wasn't,

785
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:53,594
Because no one
cooperates with me.

786
00:43:53,628 --> 00:43:55,463
What do you say
to people who say,

787
00:43:55,497 --> 00:43:57,898
"dr. Kevorkian, you
are playing god"?

788
00:43:57,933 --> 00:44:00,367
I say to them,

789
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:02,803
"so what?
" ( chuckles )

790
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:06,307
<i>When a doctor gives you a
pill, he's playing god</i>

791
00:44:06,341 --> 00:44:09,577
Because he's interfering
with your natural process.

792
00:44:09,611 --> 00:44:12,012
All doctors believe
they're god.

793
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:14,081
They shouldn't,
but they do.

794
00:44:14,116 --> 00:44:16,584
But I prefer that
than the doctors

795
00:44:16,618 --> 00:44:19,186
Who are more interested
in their stock portfolios

796
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:21,021
Than they are
in their patients.

797
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:23,190
( chatting )

798
00:44:23,225 --> 00:44:25,392
Did you see the way
she looked at you?

799
00:44:26,862 --> 00:44:28,929
She probably thought
I was unattainable.

800
00:44:28,964 --> 00:44:30,764
<i>She was very smitten.</i>

801
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:34,235
- ( chuckles ) - I knew I
should've called her barbara.

802
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:36,370
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

803
00:44:36,404 --> 00:44:39,507
- Decaf?
- No no, decaf's for cowards.

804
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:41,909
<i>Thompson: The autopsy proved that mrs.
Wantz had</i>

805
00:44:41,943 --> 00:44:44,545
<i>No anatomical evidence of
disease in her entire body.</i>

806
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,113
<i>It was all in her head
and he knows it.</i>

807
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:48,449
And mrs. Miller, although
she had a terrible disease,

808
00:44:48,483 --> 00:44:50,084
Could have lived
for many years

809
00:44:50,118 --> 00:44:52,186
If she had been more willing to
participate in her own care.

810
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,090
Ah. So you're a doctor too now, dick?
( chuckles )

811
00:44:56,124 --> 00:44:57,958
Your honor,
there isn't one iota,

812
00:44:57,993 --> 00:45:00,294
<i>One scintilla, one
speck of evidence</i>

813
00:45:00,328 --> 00:45:02,696
<i>That he murdered marjorie
wantz or sherry miller.</i>

814
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:05,633
This is all part of your
puritanical persecution

815
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:08,102
- Of dr. Kevorkian. - Enough.
I've reviewed the indictment.

816
00:45:08,136 --> 00:45:10,070
I'm dismissing
the charges.

817
00:45:10,105 --> 00:45:12,806
<i>The act of assisting a suicide
is not a criminal act</i>

818
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:14,942
According
to our current laws.

819
00:45:14,976 --> 00:45:17,945
But without a medical license,
he cannot dispense medication,

820
00:45:17,979 --> 00:45:20,714
- So don't do anything stupid.
- He won't, your honor.

821
00:45:20,749 --> 00:45:24,084
I'm gonna kick your ass
till my legs fall off.

822
00:45:25,287 --> 00:45:27,087
It was a clear victory
for the most important

823
00:45:27,122 --> 00:45:28,989
Civil rights issue
of our time.

824
00:45:29,024 --> 00:45:31,458
So you're obviously not happy
with the judge's decision.

825
00:45:31,493 --> 00:45:34,995
- Where do you go from here?
- Governor engler needs to push a ban through

826
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:38,499
The state legislature--
something, anything--

827
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:40,768
Unless you want
michigan to become

828
00:45:40,802 --> 00:45:42,836
The suicide capital
of the world.

829
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:49,009
<i>Lessenberry: Michigan

00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:11,398
<i>- If this were accepted...
- Room service.</i>

837
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:14,635
...How on god's green earth
would we prevent abuse?

838
00:46:14,669 --> 00:46:16,370
<i>Neal: Nobody here ordered
any room service!</i>

839
00:46:16,404 --> 00:46:18,472

840
00:46:18,506 --> 00:46:20,841
<i>- Who is this? - Man: It's the police, jack.
We know you're in there.</i>

841
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:23,177
- Jack: What is this? - Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

842
00:46:23,211 --> 00:46:25,212
- Don't you push me, sir.
- Where is it, jack?

843
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:26,647
Nothing is going on here.
We're just talking.

844
00:46:26,681 --> 00:46:28,716
- Man #2: Where are you folks from?
- California.

845
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,518
- Nothing illegal is going on.
- Why are you harassing us? We're not criminals!

846
00:46:31,553 --> 00:46:32,886
- You don't have to say a word.
- What's in the case?

847
00:46:32,921 --> 00:46:35,356
<i>Thompson: I know that too
many sick people lack access</i>

848
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:38,926
To care and support, too many families
are saddled with medical expenses,

849
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,263
<i>But if this were legalized, it could
lead to cost- containment strategies.</i>

850
00:46:42,297 --> 00:46:44,732
- We're here to prevent a suicide.
- We came to save your life.

851
00:46:44,766 --> 00:46:46,867
- Check this out.
- Who the hell asked you to?

852
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:50,804
- Who the hell ask you?
- I'm sorry, isabel.

853
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:54,341
Where is the suicide poisons?
Where do you keep them?

854
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:56,710
- Don't they have to have a search warrant?
- A srch warrant?

855
00:46:56,745 --> 00:46:59,647
This is not the world I
raised my three boys in.

856
00:46:59,681 --> 00:47:02,816
It's not a world
I'd recognize.

857
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:04,985
"not a world
I would recognize"?

858

<i>What is this dick
thompson bullshit?</i>

<i>Lessenberry: I believe
it's called journalism.</i>

860
00:47:09,424 --> 00:47:11,058
Both sides deserve
a voice, geoff.

861
00:47:11,092 --> 00:47:12,960
Well, fuck that

side to this story-- ours.

864
00:47:19,701 --> 00:47:22,202
Don't let me cut off
your access to jack.

00:48:02,243 --> 00:48:05,546
We have to hide 'em
in places like this.

877

We have to
handle these things

878

Huh.
This may count as loitering.

00:48:40,982 --> 00:48:43,884

<i>That you can pay a

Is pay with a check.

Leave a paper trail.

00:49:57,492 --> 00:50:00,160
A paper trail is something
someone can follow,

906
00:50:00,195 --> 00:50:01,862
And just so you know--

907
00:50:01,896 --> 00:50:03,964
Just so you know,

908
00:50:03,998 --> 00:50:06,834

- They traced it

To my storage file.

912
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:17,511
They broke in
and they took--

913
00:50:17,545 --> 00:50:20,047
Whatever, who knows?
--All my personal files

914
00:50:20,081 --> 00:50:21,715

what with.

915
00:50:21,749 --> 00:50:23,884
- And now they padlocked it...
- All right.

916
00:50:23,918 --> 00:50:26,153
- ...So I can't get in!
- I'm sorry about it, jack.

917
00:50:26,187 --> 00:50:28,055
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

918
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:30,624
I'm sorry it happened.
No one would expect this to happen,

919
00:50:30,658 --> 00:50:33,594
And mr. Fieger can get
everything back for you again.

920
00:50:33,628 --> 00:50:35,596
- Oh, mr. Fieger's gonna do it.
- Just calm down.

921
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:38,198
- I have explained to you.
- Nobody's gonna put

Do you understand? He is gone.

923
00:50:41,402 --> 00:50:44,771
- He is finish.
They have my files! - Shh. Shh.

924
00:50:44,806 --> 00:50:47,841
I'm sorry about that.
There was an overdue bill...

925
00:50:47,876 --> 00:50:50,244
- That's right. - ...
And ava sent the check in.

926
00:50:50,278 --> 00:50:52,346
- She just wasn't thinking.
She wasn't thinking. - She wasn't thinking?

927
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,548
- Wasn't thinking? You're being so generous.
- That's right.

928
00:50:54,582 --> 00:50:58,552
<i>It was stupid.
It was blatant stupidity</i>

929
00:50:58,586 --> 00:51:00,521
- On her part and your part.
- Keep your voice down.

930
00:51:00,555 --> 00:51:03,357
- Stupid! Stupid. She was being stupid.
- Hold on there.

931
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:06,393
- Stupid stupid. - Don't you
talk about my daughter that way.

932
00:51:06,427 --> 00:51:07,961
- I'll talk about her that way.
- Do you hear me?

933
00:51:07,996 --> 00:51:10,330
- You calm down. Now stop it!
- I am completely calm!

934
00:51:10,365 --> 00:51:13,066
- Calm down! You're not calm!
- You know, I can't trust you.

935
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:14,902
- I can't trust you and I can't trust her.
- You can't trust me?

936
00:51:14,936 --> 00:51:18,205
Either one of you. Together.
You don't make it easy for me.

937
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:20,007
You're supposed to make it
easy for me, but you don't.

938
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,708
How dare you, jack?
How dare you?

939
00:51:21,743 --> 00:51:23,911
You did this for the last time.
For the last time.

940
00:51:23,945 --> 00:51:25,879
All my life, I've been
making it easier for you.

941
00:51:25,914 --> 00:51:28,248
- Yeah, you make it-- - all my life!
Do you hear me?

942
00:51:28,283 --> 00:51:30,350
- Look who's yelling now.
- And it's been no walk in the park!

943
00:51:30,385 --> 00:51:32,252
That's right, it's been
no walk in the park!

944
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:35,489
And I'm going to tell you something
else-- nobody takes care of me.

945
00:51:35,523 --> 00:51:37,524
I want to ask you: Who do
you think takes care of me?

946
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:39,293
- Nobody! Not you, jack.
- I'm gonna take care of you.

947
00:51:39,327 --> 00:51:41,628
- Certainly not you!
- Right now I'm gonna take care of you.

948
00:51:41,663 --> 00:51:44,197
From now on, all you're gonna
do is operate the camera.

949
00:51:44,232 --> 00:51:46,266
That'll take care of you.
Believe me.

950
00:51:46,301 --> 00:51:48,735
You'll be fine with that,
'cause you can't screw that up.

951
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,505
- Okay, is that what you think?
- As for your daughter--

952
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:54,074
- I have news for you.
- As for your daughter, the jury is out.

953
00:51:54,108 --> 00:51:55,842
You'll be doing it for yourself.
You do it for yourself.

954
00:51:55,877 --> 00:51:58,345
You're gonna do it.
How's that for news?

955
00:51:58,379 --> 00:51:59,947
- You'll do it, jack!
- That's fine by me.

956
00:51:59,981 --> 00:52:01,848
<i>- I'm through with you!
- ( alarm beeping )</i>

957
00:52:01,883 --> 00:52:04,451
<i>- I'm through with it!
- Go ahead, set the alarm.</i>

958
00:52:04,485 --> 00:52:06,253
<i>Who cares?</i>

959
00:52:06,287 --> 00:52:08,455
Is this us?
Yeah.

960
00:52:09,424 --> 00:52:11,558
<i>- ( door shuts ) -
( alarm stops )</i>

961
00:52:11,593 --> 00:52:13,260
You set that off.

962
00:52:15,029 --> 00:52:17,731
Where the hell
is she going?

963
00:52:17,765 --> 00:52:20,467
<i>( typewriter clicking )</i>

964
00:52:22,403 --> 00:52:25,072
Margo, could you step
into my office

965
00:52:25,106 --> 00:52:27,074
For a second?
I need to talk to you.

966
00:52:31,245 --> 00:52:34,948
My dream was
to be an olympic skier.

967
00:52:36,317 --> 00:52:40,754
And after the car
accident, there was...

968
00:52:40,788 --> 00:52:42,623
A chance--

969
00:52:42,657 --> 00:52:44,391
Well, they told me that
there was a chance

970
00:52:44,425 --> 00:52:48,028
That I'd get the use of my legs
again, but it never happened.

971
00:52:48,062 --> 00:52:49,796
So...

972
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,002
I doused myself with
gasoline one night

973
00:52:55,036 --> 00:52:58,605
And lit a match.

974
00:53:06,381 --> 00:53:09,282
You know, the only thing worse
than this nightmare existence

975
00:53:09,317 --> 00:53:11,852
Is the nightmare of a
botched suicide attempt.

976
00:53:14,455 --> 00:53:17,524
I wish I could help you, son,
but it's not possible.

977
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,428
What-- what you're
suffering--

978
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:25,165
What dr.
Kevorkian is trying to say, glen,

979
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:27,634
Is that you're
clinically depressed,

980
00:53:27,669 --> 00:53:29,836
And under these circumstances,
we can't help you.

981
00:53:29,871 --> 00:53:32,572
<i>If you deal with
your depression,</i>

982
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:35,676
<i>You can lead a fulfilling
and satisfying life.</i>

983
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:39,846
<i>And we'll help you find
someone that will do that.</i>

984
00:53:58,866 --> 00:54:01,001
<i>( distant barking )</i>

985
00:54:04,405 --> 00:54:07,040
Parkinson's
takes years--

986
00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:11,411
<i>Years before it compromises
your daily activities.</i>

987
00:54:13,014 --> 00:54:16,349
I don't think we can help
you now is what I'm saying.

988
00:54:16,384 --> 00:54:18,819
But if and when
the time comes,

989
00:54:18,853 --> 00:54:20,654
We'll be here for you.

990
00:54:20,688 --> 00:54:22,789
Okay.

<i>( knocks on door )</i>

992
00:54:44,145 --> 00:54:46,646
You know I've never been
one to hold grudges

00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:49,449
And I'd like to let
bygones be bygones.

994
00:54:49,484 --> 00:54:51,351
What do you say?

995
00:54:51,385 --> 00:54:53,420
Good.

996
00:54:54,422 --> 00:54:57,324
So we're reconciled?

997
00:54:57,358 --> 00:54:59,626
- I hope so.
- Well, that's good.

998
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,829
Good.
It's good to see you.

999
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:04,831
Good to see you.

1000
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,534
You need to get ready.

1001
00:55:07,568 --> 00:55:09,536
Ready for what?

1002
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,371
Dinner at mr.
Fieger's.

1003
00:55:11,405 --> 00:55:13,373
Very nice.

1004
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,375
What's that?

1005
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:18,145
Oh, it's a notice of sale.

1006
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:20,914
I mean, this whole
building's kaput.

1007
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:23,316
Well, don't worry about it.

1008
00:55:23,351 --> 00:55:25,352
We can live together.

1009
00:55:25,386 --> 00:55:29,256
We'll be known as the
unemployed kevorkians! Yay!

1010
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:31,057
<i>Unemployed?
What does that mean?</i>

1011
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:33,059
It means...

1012
00:55:33,094 --> 00:55:34,795
I got fired.

1013
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:36,897
No.
When?

1014
00:55:37,965 --> 00:55:39,533
A few weeks ago.

1015
00:55:39,567 --> 00:55:41,701
You're just
telling me now?

1016
00:55:41,736 --> 00:55:44,604
Jack, we had
a falling out.

1017
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,506
What happened?

1018
00:55:48,743 --> 00:55:50,577
I'm your sister.

1019
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:52,946
What else?

1020
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,316
( chanting ) life is god's choice!
Life is god's choice!

1021
00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:00,720
- Margo: Oh, my gosh.
- These are my new daily visitors.

1022
00:56:00,755 --> 00:56:02,889
<i>Life is god's choice!</i>

1023
00:56:02,924 --> 00:56:06,860
Are you going to kill every
single person in a wheelchair?

1024
00:56:06,894 --> 00:56:09,629
Disabled people are not worthless.
They are not a drain on society.

1025
00:56:09,664 --> 00:56:12,132
<i>You cannot rid the world
of inconvenience.</i>

1026
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,700
<i>You are worse than   an .</i>

1027
00:56:13,734 --> 00:56:15,335
Oh, shut up,
you witch!

1028
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:17,571
<i>These are not
comparable issues.</i>

1029
00:56:17,605 --> 00:56:21,541
Some great minds have died with
the assistance of their doctors--

1030
00:56:21,576 --> 00:56:24,010
Sigmund freud,
king george.

1031
00:56:24,045 --> 00:56:26,213
<i>Jack: If it's good
enough for the aristoi,</i>

1032
00:56:26,247 --> 00:56:28,081
<i>It's good enough for
the hoi polloi.</i>

1033
00:56:28,115 --> 00:56:32,085
He is leading society into
an age of enlightenment,

1034
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:35,121
<i>- You idiots! - Woman: Only
god can create and destroy.</i>

1035
00:56:35,156 --> 00:56:36,923
Have you no religion?
Have you no god?

1036
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:39,693
Oh, I do, lady.
I have a religion.

1037
00:56:39,727 --> 00:56:43,263
His name is bach--
johann sebastian bach.

1038
00:56:43,297 --> 00:56:45,966
And at least my god
isn't an invented one.

1039
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,401
- ( car starts ) - ( chanting
resumes ) life is god's choice!

1040
00:56:48,436 --> 00:56:50,904
<i>Life is
god's choice!</i>

1041
00:56:50,938 --> 00:56:53,139
Life is god's choice!

1042
00:56:53,174 --> 00:56:55,275
Life is
god's choice!

1043
00:56:55,309 --> 00:56:57,410
Life is god's choice!

1044
00:56:57,445 --> 00:57:01,181
- Life is god's choice!
- Man: Who do you think you are?!

1045
00:57:01,215 --> 00:57:03,250
Life is god's choice!

1046
00:57:03,284 --> 00:57:05,886
- Life is god's choice!
- Who do you think you are?!

1047
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,322
Life is god's choice!
Life is god's choice!

1048
00:57:09,357 --> 00:57:11,358
Life is
god's choice!

1049
00:57:11,392 --> 00:57:14,261
( chanting fades )

1050
00:57:14,295 --> 00:57:16,396
( silent )

1051
00:57:27,808 --> 00:57:30,010
Life is god's choice!

1052
00:57:30,044 --> 00:57:32,045
Life is
god's choice!

1053
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,681
Life is god's choice!

1054
00:57:39,153 --> 00:57:42,289
"a fart on thomas putnam!
"

1055
00:57:42,323 --> 00:57:44,658
( all laugh )

1056
00:57:44,692 --> 00:57:47,560
Of course, that was the lone
laugh in the entire play.

1057
00:57:47,595 --> 00:57:50,463
"because it  my name.

1058
00:57:50,498 --> 00:57:54,467
Because I cannot have
another in my life.

1059
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:58,405
Because I am not
worth the dust

1060
00:57:58,439 --> 00:58:01,041
On the feet
of them that hang.

1061
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,478
How may I live
without my name?

1062
00:58:05,513 --> 00:58:08,281
I've given
you my soul;

1063
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:12,285
<i>Leave me my name.
"</i>

1064
00:58:13,187 --> 00:58:14,788
<i>Woman: Oh.</i>

1065
00:58:16,324 --> 00:58:18,291
Is there
any more to that?

1066
00:58:20,094 --> 00:58:23,196
- ( laughing )
- no.

1067
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,965
<i>- Margo: Oh, jack.
- That was beautiful, jack.</i>

1068
00:58:24,999 --> 00:58:26,800
- Thank you.
- I didn't know you knew that.

1069
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:29,069
<i>That's very good.
That was great.</i>

1070
00:58:29,103 --> 00:58:31,838
- It's all I know.
- You didn't like the sea bass?

1071
00:58:33,107 --> 00:58:35,809
It was
a bit fishy, but--

1072
00:58:35,843 --> 00:58:38,044
- Oh.
- No no no no.

1073
00:58:40,948 --> 00:58:43,016
Why did
you never marry, jack?

1074
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:45,051
Oh.
He was engaged once.

1075
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:47,687
She worked at hudson's
on woodward, downtown.

1076
00:58:47,722 --> 00:58:50,290
- I knew her. I saw her.
- Let's not go there. Let's not go there.

1077
00:58:50,324 --> 00:58:52,325
- You never even liked her.
- No, I didn't like her.

1078
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,661
<i>- Jack: Let's not go there.
- All right, I won't go there.</i>

1079
00:58:54,695 --> 00:58:57,530
Oh, come on, come on.
Tell me about this fiance.

1080
00:58:57,565 --> 00:59:00,000
- ( groans ) - margo: Come on, jack.
Say a few words.

1081
00:59:00,034 --> 00:59:02,669
- A little something?
- What can I tell you?

1082
00:59:02,703 --> 00:59:05,438
- We broke up. It was-- you
know-- - I think the truth is

1083
00:59:05,473 --> 00:59:07,774
<i>That girls just make you
shake in your boots, jack.</i>

1084
00:59:07,808 --> 00:59:10,010
- Okay. Yeah.
- All right then.

1085
00:59:10,044 --> 00:59:11,945
Somebody needs
some coffee.

1086
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:13,413
So come, margo,

1087
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:16,683
Come where it's safe.

1088
00:59:21,222 --> 00:59:24,491
Governor engler's gonna be signing
a ban in a couple of months.

1089
00:59:24,525 --> 00:59:28,194
It'll make assisting a
suicide a four-year felony.

1090
00:59:28,229 --> 00:59:31,064
Oh.
Oh, that's laughable.

1091
00:59:31,098 --> 00:59:32,732
<i>It's a fucking charade,</i>

1092
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:35,035
And I'll appeal it when
the time is right.

1093
00:59:35,069 --> 00:59:37,237
In the meantime, if you
have anything lined up,

1094
00:59:37,271 --> 00:59:39,639
<i>I suggest you get
it done pronto.</i>

1095
00:59:44,378 --> 00:59:45,945
<i>Neal: We'd have been
shit out of luck</i>

1096
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,747
<i>If I hadn't traced
those two down</i>

1097
00:59:47,782 --> 00:59:49,382
At a wholesaler
in kalamazoo,

1098
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:52,118
Where it just so happens an
old flame of mine works.

1099
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:55,121
A couple of happy-hour
margaritas sealed the deal.

1100
00:59:55,156 --> 00:59:57,023
Then it was
worth the drive?

1101
00:59:57,058 --> 00:59:59,726
( chuckles )
it's always worth it.

1102
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,562
Jack, I just ain't sure
these are gonna be enough.

1103
01:00:02,596 --> 01:00:05,432
I'll make it work.
I can ration it.

1104
01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:08,968
Anyway, I think
I've got an idea,

1105
01:00:09,003 --> 01:00:10,670
A way to recapture
the gas.

1106
01:00:10,704 --> 01:00:14,007
Let's stop over
at the hardware store.

1107
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:15,708
Oh, and that's--

1108
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:20,246
I apologize for putting
you through is, ma'am.

1109
01:00:20,281 --> 01:00:21,781
( wheezing coughing )

1110
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:26,286
It's the emphysema.

1111
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,254
I know.
Yes, I know.

1112
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:30,690
I know.
We'll just wait for it to pass.

1113
01:00:30,724 --> 01:00:32,892
Let him have this one out.
Go ahead.

1114
01:00:32,927 --> 01:00:36,529
- ( breathing heavily
) - and we breathe.

1115
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,768
- Okay.
- Okay.

1116
01:00:41,802 --> 01:00:43,203
Okay, so we're--

1117
01:00:43,237 --> 01:00:45,305
I think we're ready
for the box first.

1118
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:47,073
Like I said
to you before,

1119
01:00:47,108 --> 01:00:50,076
Because of the
circumstances I'm in now,

1120
01:00:50,111 --> 01:00:53,213
We have to use this because
I'm saving the gas.

1121
01:00:53,247 --> 01:00:56,082
You understand?
We're going to recapture the gas.

1122
01:00:56,117 --> 01:00:59,152
They won't give me
more canisters,

1123
01:00:59,186 --> 01:01:01,187
And I have
other patients to serve--

1124
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:03,556
Two others, and I--

1125
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:06,126
Maybe this isn't such
a great idea, doctor.

1126
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,595
- I don't think it's gonna hold.
- I think it's gonna be fine.

1127
01:01:08,629 --> 01:01:10,063
We're almost there.

1128
01:01:10,097 --> 01:01:12,398
Just a little
more tape right here...

1129
01:01:12,433 --> 01:01:15,101
- There. - ...
Just to keep it in. Here we go.

1130
01:01:15,136 --> 01:01:17,270
Like we talked about
before, all right?

1131
01:01:17,304 --> 01:01:21,141
What we said-- neal is gonna
turn on the gas canister...

1132
01:01:21,175 --> 01:01:23,743
- Okay. - ...
When you are ready.

1133
01:01:23,777 --> 01:01:25,411
So we're gonna get
the signal from you.

1134
01:01:25,446 --> 01:01:27,680
- Yes, sir.
- Sorry for this.

1135
01:01:27,715 --> 01:01:29,449
- This is not usual-- - no no.
No no.

1136
01:01:29,483 --> 01:01:32,018
This is not usually what we do,
but we've run out of luck here.

1137
01:01:32,052 --> 01:01:33,887
- It's okay.
It's all right. - Okay.

1138
01:01:33,921 --> 01:01:35,522
Ready.

1139
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:40,193
( gas hisses )

1140
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:44,164
All right.

1141
01:01:44,198 --> 01:01:46,232
Thank you for
a great life, cheryl.

1142
01:01:46,267 --> 01:01:48,735
Cheryl:
You too.

1143
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:55,275
( gas hissing )

1144
01:01:57,945 --> 01:02:00,246
You're so brave.

1145
01:02:11,992 --> 01:02:13,560
Wait.
Take-- take it off.

1146
01:02:13,594 --> 01:02:15,228
Take-- take it off.

1147
01:02:15,262 --> 01:02:18,665
- Take it off. Take it off.
- ( hissing stops )

1148
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:20,400
- Getting hot.
- Hot?

1149
01:02:20,434 --> 01:02:22,635
- Watch his-- watch his-- - hot.
Oh.

1150
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:24,370
- Getting so hot.
- It's what?

1151
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:26,906
- Getting so hot.
Hot. - Hot.

1152
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:31,344
- He's burning up.
- Okay, maybe we-- this has got to wait.

1153
01:02:31,378 --> 01:02:33,446
- Oh, I think so.
- No no, please.

1154
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,515
I wasn't-- I wasn't
prepared for the issue.

1155
01:02:35,549 --> 01:02:38,551
- I'm awfully sorry.
So let's-- - it's all right, doc.

1156
01:02:38,586 --> 01:02:41,921
It's all right.
Now, please.

1157
01:02:41,956 --> 01:02:46,059
Do it now, please.
( wheezes ) do it.

1158
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:51,798
Okay, let's do it
this way.

1159
01:02:51,832 --> 01:02:54,767
You kn,
let's get rid of that.

1160
01:02:54,802 --> 01:02:58,271
Just-- let's just put the box on.
It'd be better.

1161
01:02:58,305 --> 01:03:02,175
This is gonna
be easier, hugh.

1162
01:03:02,209 --> 01:03:04,244
- This--
- watch your head.

1163
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:06,579
- Down.
- Okay.

1164
01:03:06,614 --> 01:03:08,047
- Watch your head.
- Jack: Here it is.

1165
01:03:08,082 --> 01:03:10,049
<i>- Neal: Mind your head.
- Jack: Mind your head.</i>

1166
01:03:10,084 --> 01:03:12,018
<i>Just push it-- that's it.
That's fine.</i>

1167
01:03:12,052 --> 01:03:15,188
This is gonna
be easier now,

1168
01:03:15,222 --> 01:03:19,225
Because the gas will
escape now.

1169
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,594
<i>It won't heat up.</i>

1170
01:03:21,629 --> 01:03:25,098
<i>Just like that, hugh.
Okay? Okay?</i>

1171
01:03:25,132 --> 01:03:27,734
<i>Now air is gonna get through,
so you'll be all right.</i>

1172
01:03:27,768 --> 01:03:29,636
You're not gonna heat up.

1173
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,604
Let me just get this.

1174
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:34,240
Here we are.

1175
01:03:36,543 --> 01:03:39,545
<i>Okay. Once again, when
you're ready, hugh,</i>

1176
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:42,015
<i>We'll have neal turn
the gas on again.</i>

1177
01:03:42,049 --> 01:03:44,417
I love you, darling.

1178
01:03:44,451 --> 01:03:46,252
- I love you.
- I love you.

1179
01:03:46,287 --> 01:03:50,089
<i>( crying )
it's okay, darling.</i>

1180
01:03:52,026 --> 01:03:53,926
( gas hisses )

1181
01:03:58,132 --> 01:04:00,333
<i>- Hugh: You-- -
woman: I love you.</i>

1182
01:04:09,276 --> 01:04:12,478
<i>- ( clip clatters )
- woman: Oh god.</i>

1183
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:14,981
<i>- ( crying )
- ( gas hissing )</i>

1184
01:04:18,085 --> 01:04:20,486
I love you.

1185
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:22,722
I love you,
darling.

1186
01:04:24,058 --> 01:04:25,992
I love you.

1187
01:04:27,461 --> 01:04:29,996
( crying )

1188
01:04:42,743 --> 01:04:44,811
( whispers )
he's gone, my dear.

1189
01:05:00,527 --> 01:05:03,262
I'm gonna type out the
final action report.

1190
01:05:03,297 --> 01:05:05,264
And give it
to you tomorrow.

1191
01:05:15,509 --> 01:05:17,543
God!

1192
01:05:20,881 --> 01:05:22,749
So you ever gonna
say anything?

1193
01:05:22,783 --> 01:05:26,386
Because nothing irks me more than
having you sitting there simmering.

1194
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,855
<i>God forbid
I should irk you.</i>

1195
01:05:28,889 --> 01:05:31,357
Well, just spit it out.
You've got something to say.

1196
01:05:31,392 --> 01:05:34,761
The great jack kevorkian.
You know better.

1197
01:05:34,795 --> 01:05:37,630
- That's right.
- Nothing gets in the way of the mission.

1198
01:05:37,664 --> 01:05:39,565
The mission?
What mission.

1199
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,435
Is that what
you call rationing,

1200
01:05:42,469 --> 01:05:46,239
Taping a fucking sheet of plastic
around a poor guy's head?

1201
01:05:46,273 --> 01:05:49,175
We should've waited
till we had more gas.

1202
01:05:49,209 --> 01:05:53,212
- Oh, and when would that have been I wonder?
- I should've insisted.

1203
01:05:54,348 --> 01:05:57,083
He was-- he was-- he
was-- he was done.

1204
01:05:57,117 --> 01:05:59,318
<i>Do you understand?
He wand it done.</i>

1205
01:05:59,353 --> 01:06:01,687
He was begging for it.
We wanted to go.

1206
01:06:01,722 --> 01:06:04,023
<i>We were ready to go.
He was beggingus to stay.</i>

1207
01:06:04,057 --> 01:06:06,692
He wanted it done.
You saw that.

1208
01:06:06,727 --> 01:06:09,595
Yeah, I saw it.
It freaked the shit out of me.

1209
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:13,199
Well, it worked out.

1210
01:06:13,233 --> 01:06:15,334
It got done.

1211
01:06:16,503 --> 01:06:18,371
I knew it would.

1212
01:06:22,142 --> 01:06:24,210
We can't be cutting
corners anymore.

1213
01:06:24,244 --> 01:06:26,012
This isn't the old days.

1214
01:06:26,046 --> 01:06:28,548
We're not down in the
lab winging it anymore.

1215
01:06:34,021 --> 01:06:37,023
Jack, the next time it
doesn't feel right,

1216
01:06:37,057 --> 01:06:38,925
Call it off.

1217
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,932
These are
my decisions
to make, neal.

1218
01:06:45,966 --> 01:06:48,868
Mine alone.

1219
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,772
Yes, sir, kemo sabe.

1220
01:06:53,807 --> 01:06:55,775
<i>( typewriter clicking )</i>

1221
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:11,958
This is the one we got

1222
01:07:11,992 --> 01:07:13,893
Through the search
warrant at kevorkian's,

1223
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:16,829
And you can see where he's whited out
a number of lines and typed over.

1224
01:07:16,864 --> 01:07:19,632
And this is the one
found in nicol's trash

1225
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:21,968
<i>By a concerned activist.</i>

1226
01:07:22,002 --> 01:07:24,637
Mr. Gale's desperate pleas
to take off his gas mask

1227
01:07:24,671 --> 01:07:26,572
Were deleted and replaced
with the phrase...

1228
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:29,041
"patient became flushed, agitated.
Breathing deeply."

1229
01:07:29,076 --> 01:07:31,577
"increased rate of respiration
and muscle tension

1230
01:07:31,612 --> 01:07:34,981
- With no overaction.
" - this directly contradicts

1231
01:07:35,015 --> 01:07:38,184
- Mr. Nicol's photocopied version...
- "saying 'take it off.'"

1232
01:07:38,218 --> 01:07:42,288
...And suggests that dr.
Kevorkian was attempting to cover something up.

1233
01:07:42,322 --> 01:07:44,724
"saying 'take it off'
once again,

1234
01:07:44,758 --> 01:07:46,592
He fell into unconsciousness.
"

1235
01:07:46,627 --> 01:07:49,595
The tragedy is that mr.
Gale did not want to die that day,

1236
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:51,130
But dr.
Kevorkian didn't care.

1237
01:07:51,164 --> 01:07:53,533
An inquest will be held.

1238
01:07:54,635 --> 01:07:56,402
<i>Thompson: He lied
in his report!</i>

1239
01:07:56,436 --> 01:07:58,104
<i>Fieger: He is the most
honest man I know.</i>

1240
01:07:58,138 --> 01:08:02,108
<i>- Honest to a fault!
- Man: Could we continue please?</i>

1241
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:08,247
Mr. Nicol, when mr.
Gale said, "take it off"--

1242
01:08:08,282 --> 01:08:10,149
He was talking
about the plastic tent

1243
01:08:10,183 --> 01:08:12,218
On his head,
not the gas mask.

1244
01:08:13,687 --> 01:08:17,890
And his lungs locked up.
That happens with emphysema.

1245
01:08:17,925 --> 01:08:19,725
Then why would dr.
Kevorkian

1246
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,527
Feel the need
to correct--

1247
01:08:21,562 --> 01:08:23,930
You're grasping
at straws here.

1248
01:08:25,365 --> 01:08:29,335
It was a simple
typographical error,

1249
01:08:29,369 --> 01:08:31,203
Which I had
pointed out to him

1250
01:08:31,238 --> 01:08:32,905
And he corrected.

1251
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:36,442
He typed up a new copy whieh was
going to go in our records.

1252
01:08:36,476 --> 01:08:37,877
Before you ransacked
his apartment!

1253
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:40,613
But this typo, in its original,
was four lines long.

1254
01:08:40,647 --> 01:08:44,050
Why wouldn't he just rip it up and
start again if it was a mistake?

1255
01:08:46,887 --> 01:08:49,221
To save on paper.

1256
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:52,258
Dr.
Kevorkian is

1257
01:08:52,292 --> 01:08:54,560
Incredibly cheap.

1258
01:08:55,596 --> 01:08:58,831
<i>It was
a very emotional day,</i>

1259
01:08:58,865 --> 01:09:01,067
<i>As they all are.</i>

1260
01:09:02,202 --> 01:09:04,103
And I'm sure
when he typed it up,

1261
01:09:04,137 --> 01:09:05,504
It was in the middle
of the night

1262
01:09:05,539 --> 01:09:07,807
And he was trying to do
three things at once

1263
01:09:07,841 --> 01:09:09,742
<i>Like he always does.</i>

1264
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:14,714
Mrs.
Gale, please,

1265
01:09:14,748 --> 01:09:17,550
For your husband's sake,

1266
01:09:18,518 --> 01:09:20,353
The truth.

1267
01:09:23,557 --> 01:09:25,057
( clears throat )

1268
01:09:25,092 --> 01:09:28,694
My husband of 22 years

1269
01:09:30,063 --> 01:09:33,599
Faced death so many times
from his seizures,

1270
01:09:34,801 --> 01:09:37,703
<i>He used to pray
not to wake up.</i>

1271
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:39,939
<i>He talked about
shooting himself,</i>

1272
01:09:39,973 --> 01:09:43,609
<i>But he didn't want to leave
me the mess to clean up.</i>

1273
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,449
So here's your truth, mr.
Thompson.

1274
01:09:51,818 --> 01:09:54,286
As sick as hugh was,

1275
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:56,689
I begged h
not to make the call.

1276
01:09:56,723 --> 01:09:59,191
I begged him every
night for nine months.

1277
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,328
<i>And then before christmas,</i>

1278
01:10:02,362 --> 01:10:05,097
<i>I asked him what he
wanted for a gift--</i>

1279
01:10:06,266 --> 01:10:08,567
<i>The last gift I'd
ever give him--</i>

1280
01:10:12,906 --> 01:10:16,542
And he said, "there's only one
thing you can get me, sweetheart.

1281
01:10:17,811 --> 01:10:21,280
It's an appointment with dr.
Kevorkian."

1282
01:10:28,388 --> 01:10:30,890
I find no factual basis
to proceed.

1283
01:10:33,193 --> 01:10:35,695
<i>- ( jazz music playing )
- ( people vocalizing )</i>

1284
01:10:42,869 --> 01:10:45,371
<i>- ( people chatting ) - fieger:
Exonerated once again.</i>

1285
01:10:45,405 --> 01:10:48,574
Jack, 15;
thompson, zilch.

1286
01:10:48,608 --> 01:10:52,244
Wow. No wonder everyone's
drinking at this show.

1287
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:53,813
( margo laughs )

1288
01:10:53,847 --> 01:10:56,449
Is that santa claus
stepping on a baby?

1289
01:10:56,483 --> 01:11:00,553
- Yes. - Janet: Tell me
about doc's christmases.

1290
01:11:00,587 --> 01:11:02,988
It looks quite morbid--

1291
01:11:03,023 --> 01:11:05,024
Well, except for
the flower that is.

1292
01:11:05,058 --> 01:11:07,460
Thank god
I'm not a shrink.

1293
01:11:07,494 --> 01:11:11,864
<i>Margo: Our grandparents,
our aunts, our uncles,</i>

1294
01:11:11,898 --> 01:11:15,868
<i>The armenian holocaust was
the same as the jews.</i>

1295
01:11:15,902 --> 01:11:18,771
Only our parents--
barely teenagers--

1296
01:11:18,805 --> 01:11:20,639
Were able to flee.

1297
01:11:20,674 --> 01:11:24,343
Growing up, all we heard were those
terrible stories of all the bloodshed,

1298
01:11:24,377 --> 01:11:27,880
<i>And it frightened jack so.</i>

1299
01:11:27,914 --> 01:11:32,885
It's all dealing with the
melancholy age-old struggle

1300
01:11:32,919 --> 01:11:35,955
Between warmth of life,
the iciness of death.

1301
01:11:35,989 --> 01:11:39,959
Only I'm sure that theme
would be better served

1302
01:11:39,993 --> 01:11:42,661
Had a real artist done it.

1303
01:11:42,696 --> 01:11:44,830
<i>Margo: Many nights he would
just sit in his bed--</i>

1304
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:46,799
Lights on a must--
you know,

1305
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:48,868
Clutching that little
dog of ours so tightly.

1306
01:11:48,902 --> 01:11:51,504
<i>Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
He had a dog?</i>

1307
01:11:51,538 --> 01:11:53,139
You're looking
so intently.

1308
01:11:53,173 --> 01:11:55,374
- Yes. - What are you feeling?
That's what I'd like to know.

1309
01:11:55,408 --> 01:11:58,177
- Jack, it's, uh-- it's--
- it's, uh--

1310
01:11:58,211 --> 01:11:59,745
- Hi.
- Hi.

1311
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,514
- It's, um-- - I know
what you're feeling.

1312
01:12:01,548 --> 01:12:03,382
<i>You're feeling it's--
it's macabre.</i>

1313
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:05,017
<i>Stan: It is macabre, my friend.
</i>

1314
01:12:05,051 --> 01:12:07,019
<i>Jack: Yes, but you're
looking at it nonetheless.</i>

1315
01:12:07,053 --> 01:12:10,022
It's like war.
War, you're drawn to it,

1316
01:12:10,056 --> 01:12:14,360
But after you've been through it,
you say, "oh, that was grotesque,

1317
01:12:14,394 --> 01:12:17,496
Macabre, strange, ugly.
"

1318
01:12:17,531 --> 01:12:19,899
That's the feeling I'm
trying to convey.

1319
01:12:19,933 --> 01:12:22,334
- I'm sold.
- I heard "sold."

1320
01:12:22,369 --> 01:12:25,971
- How much, jack?
- Whatever you think is fair.

1321
01:12:26,006 --> 01:12:28,507
- My patients thank you in advance.
- Good.

1322
01:12:29,676 --> 01:12:31,577
This is from
my private collection.

1323
01:12:42,255 --> 01:12:44,256
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

1324
01:12:58,605 --> 01:13:00,139
Hello.

01:13:00,173 --> 01:13:02,041
<i>Man: Dr.
Kevorkian, I'm afraid we have</i>

1326
01:13:02,075 --> 01:13:04,510
<i>Some bad news regarding
your sister.</i>

1327
01:13:05,745 --> 01:13:07,179
<i>It appears she had
the heart attack</i>

1328
01:13:07,214 --> 01:13:09,682
A couple of hours before
she called 9-1-1.

1329
01:13:09,716 --> 01:13:14,220
Perhaps she thought that whatever
it was, it would just pass.

1330
01:13:16,323 --> 01:13:18,457
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss.

1331
01:13:31,504 --> 01:13:33,672
Wouldn't you like
to see her?

1332
01:13:39,045 --> 01:13:40,679
( whispers ) no.

1333
01:13:42,015 --> 01:13:44,149

<i>Jack: "by late, much

1336
01:13:59,432 --> 01:14:01,333
<i>Of the burden she bore,</i>

1337
01:14:01,368 --> 01:14:03,636
<i>My sis margo gave more</i>

1338

<i>To my life than she
ever received."</i>

1339
01:14:21,354 --> 01:14:23,022
The whole question
of death and dying

1340
01:14:23,056 --> 01:14:26,392
Involves the most profound and
complex ethical questions

1341
01:14:26,426 --> 01:14:28,360
That we must decide
as a society.

1342
01:14:28,395 --> 01:14:30,396
<i>At no time have the
people of michigan</i>

1343
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:33,766
<i>Or the michigan legislature
granted jack kevorkian</i>

1344
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,968
<i>Or any other individual
the sole right</i>

1345
01:14:36,002 --> 01:14:38,504
<i>To decide who lives or
dies in our state.</i>

1346

- Thank you. - Thank you, governor.
Congratulations.

Just bring it right over here.

- Oh yeah.

Yeah, give me a hand here.

<i>- Geese? - Yeah.
( chuckles )</i>

1366
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:40,199
Well, it is a bit
romantic for my taste.

1367
01:15:40,233 --> 01:15:44,269
Well, sue me for trying to put a
goddamn roof over your head, jack.

1368
01:15:44,304 --> 01:15:47,206
- Well-- - I'm not letting
you live in some y.M.C.A.

1369
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,308
<i>- Come on.
- Fine.</i>

1370
01:15:49,342 --> 01:15:51,610
Only I haven't
taken this yet.

1371
01:15:51,644 --> 01:15:54,880
And if I do,
I'm paying the rent.

1372
01:15:55,949 --> 01:15:57,950
No charity case.

1373
01:15:58,818 --> 01:16:00,352
<i>Okay, I'll take it.</i>

1374
01:16:01,855 --> 01:16:03,422
Okay.

1376

Don't you have work to get back to?

"like what?
"

1379
01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:16,301
Like appealing the 15-month
ban that's tying my hands.

1380
01:16:16,336 --> 01:16:18,504
What's on your mind, jack?

1381
01:16:18,538 --> 01:16:22,007
They made a law
specifically to stop me.

1382

<i>- I want to challenge it.
- ( paper rustling )</i>

Don't strain.
Don't strain.

1392
01:16:49,002 --> 01:16:51,804

- He's gonna get a cramp here?

1393
01:16:51,838 --> 01:16:55,774
Does he? Yes. All right, that's
enough of the physical stuff, tom.

1394
01:16:55,809 --> 01:17:00,112
No more physical. I just wanted you
to move a little for the record.

1395
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:04,316
So now, tom, tell me:

What is it you wish?

1397
01:17:05,652 --> 01:17:07,820

Bond is set for $50,000.
Are you gonna pay that today?

1401
01:17:49,028 --> 01:17:50,529
Oh, that is beyond

1402
01:17:50,563 --> 01:17:53,465
That is no way I'm going to pay

1490
01:22:38,017 --> 01:22:41,253
Does not change the fact that
we still have a ban in effect.

1491
01:22:41,287 --> 01:22:43,922
- ( crowd shouting ) -
I think mankind took--

1492
01:22:43,956 --> 01:22:46,558
Took an historic
step today

1493
01:22:46,592 --> 01:22:48,026
Out of the dark ages.

1494
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:50,295
It makes me think of
the nuremberg trials.

1495
01:22:50,329 --> 01:22:54,332
When a law is deemed
immoral by you,

1496
01:22:54,367 --> 01:22:57,602
You must disobey it.
You must disobey it.

1497
01:22:57,637 --> 01:22:59,504
- Thank you.
- Dick.

1498
01:23:01,207 --> 01:23:04,643
The man's invincible.
So am I.

1499
01:23:04,677 --> 01:23:07,179
I just got word that the
court of appeals is

1500
01:23:07,213 --> 01:23:09,047
Gonna hear arguments
on your ban!

1501
01:23:09,081 --> 01:23:11,716
Hell, I'm gonna
win that too!

1502
01:23:11,751 --> 01:23:15,120
<i>Jack: Why can't we have
clinics doing this stuff?</i>

1503
01:23:15,154 --> 01:23:17,255
Every city should have a clinic
where someone can go to.

1504
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:20,358
As a matter of fact, I just got an idea.
I'm gonna have one of my own.

1505
01:23:20,393 --> 01:23:22,327
How does it feel
to be victorious?

1506
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:24,262
Victorious?
I never feel victorious.

1507
01:23:24,297 --> 01:23:25,964
I just go ahead
and do what I do.

1508
01:23:25,998 --> 01:23:28,867
This isn't a victory to me.
It's just common sense.

1509
01:23:31,037 --> 01:23:33,638
Neal: You don't need hardly nouhing.
The walls are good.

1510
01:23:33,673 --> 01:23:35,707
Janet: No, they're not.
You can't leave it white.

1511
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:38,643
- What's wrong with white?
- You want something that's cream

1512
01:23:38,678 --> 01:23:41,213
Or robin's egg blue.
Something that's warm.

1513
01:23:41,247 --> 01:23:43,548
Something
that's peaceful.

1514
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:45,650
<i>Jack: Should it be
higher, you think?</i>

1515
01:23:45,685 --> 01:23:48,119
Well, I don't have any window
nails on me right now, doc.

1516
01:23:48,154 --> 01:23:51,356
Well, you know, neal, it's
not like it's 500 lbs.

1517
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:53,859
You just lift it up--
there it is.

1518
01:23:53,893 --> 01:23:55,827

but who cares, right?</i>

1520
01:23:58,965 --> 01:24:00,632
- There you go.
- I think it's perfect.

1521
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:02,667
- Yup.
- No, I couldn't tell

1522
01:24:02,702 --> 01:24:04,903
Because I've got to go
outside and see it. Here.

1523
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:09,140

Oh, yeah!

That a mentally-

Does not have the right to
look a doctor in the eye

1533

The court of appeals'

And they ruled
in our favor.

1590
01:27:52,531 --> 01:27:54,866
They said that the law
was so poorly worded

1591
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,534
That it could not
be upheld.

1592
01:27:56,569 --> 01:27:59,370

They also ruled that there's no
constitutional right to commit suicide...

I take back
what I just said.

...And that aiding

1651
01:30:34,293 --> 01:30:36,494
For me and there's
certainly no step...

1652
01:30:36,528 --> 01:30:38,496
Time to give it up, dick.

1653
01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:41,799
<i>...
Or I would not be here.</i>

1654
01:30:45,838 --> 01:30:49,073
<i>- ( people chatting ) - woman: Go on.
Go on.</i>

1655
01:30:49,108 --> 01:30:50,742
Jack.

1656
01:30:50,776 --> 01:30:52,210
Jack.

1657
01:30:52,244 --> 01:30:54,879
I told you those videotapes were
going to be our golden ticket.

1658
01:30:54,914 --> 01:30:59,250
We have to take this to
the supreme court, geoff.

1659
01:30:59,285 --> 01:31:00,718
We have to do it.

1660
01:31:00,753 --> 01:31:02,720
We've still got
to get a law

1661
01:31:02,755 --> 01:31:05,823
- Legalizing assisted suicide, no?
- Congratulations.

1662
01:31:05,858 --> 01:31:08,893
Hey, jack. Come on.
You won. Enjoy yourself.

1663
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,895
Morganroth is right, jack.
You'll never see another courtroom again.

1664
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:12,664
<i>The house of cards
is falling</i>

1665
01:31:12,698 --> 01:31:14,832
And engler's
going down with it.

1666
01:31:17,169 --> 01:31:20,405
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen!
- Man: Come on.</i>

1667
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:22,674
<i>Fieger: Please please, I have
an important announcement.</i>

1668
01:31:24,076 --> 01:31:26,010
I have decided
to run for governor.

1669
01:31:26,045 --> 01:31:27,478
- Hear hear!
- ( cheering )

1670
01:31:27,513 --> 01:31:30,915
<i>- Man: Whoo!
- Fieger: Fieger for governor!</i>

1671
01:31:32,885 --> 01:31:35,219
Feiger's
your finest!

1672
01:31:36,221 --> 01:31:38,690
<i>Next stop--
lansing!</i>

1673
01:31:50,369 --> 01:31:54,973
<i>Fieger: David gorcyca,
oakland county prosecutor.</i>

1674
01:31:55,007 --> 01:31:56,774
It has
a nice ring to it.

1675
01:31:56,809 --> 01:32:00,311
You know, you owe me after the way
I demolished thompson for you.

1676
01:32:00,346 --> 01:32:02,480
And I know you'll stay
out of jack's hair.

1677
01:32:02,514 --> 01:32:04,816
Thomson blew away too
many taxpayer dollars

1678
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:06,351
On these prwsecutions.

1679
01:32:06,385 --> 01:32:08,920
I've no intention to
waste one more nickel.

1680
01:32:08,954 --> 01:32:10,955
As long as kevorkian
stays in line,

1681
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,324
He can assist as many patients
as he damn well pleases.

1682
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:17,095
No worries. Jack's learned to
listen to everything I say.

1683
01:32:18,931 --> 01:32:21,366
<i>Jack: You know, I'm
only operating</i>

1684
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,768
<i>By the grace of
this prosecutor.</i>

1685
01:32:23,802 --> 01:32:26,971
<i>"go ahead.
You can go do your thing</i>

1686
01:32:27,006 --> 01:32:29,207
<i>In some dark little
corner of the universe,</i>

1687
01:32:29,241 --> 01:32:31,542
But do it quietly.
" you know?

1688
01:32:31,577 --> 01:32:34,345
Oh, the lingering
of death.

1689
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:35,913
What a business.

1690
01:32:35,948 --> 01:32:38,082
Keep death alive.

1691
01:32:38,117 --> 01:32:40,518
Hospitals don't make
money otherwise.

1692
01:32:40,552 --> 01:32:42,553
Drug companies either.

1693
01:32:42,588 --> 01:32:45,456
<i>If you're rich and
you have the money,</i>

1694
01:32:45,491 --> 01:32:47,358
<i>You can pay to die.</i>

1695
01:32:47,393 --> 01:32:50,094
<i>But the poor, they
can only afford</i>

1696
01:32:50,129 --> 01:32:52,497
<i>To stick it out
and suffer.</i>

1697
01:32:52,531 --> 01:32:56,134
They say complacency
is a virtue.

1698
01:32:56,168 --> 01:32:59,704
Oh, stop whining.
You make me more nauseous than my chemo.

1699
01:32:59,738 --> 01:33:03,341
You have full reign.
Just deal with it.

1700
01:33:03,375 --> 01:33:05,610
Yeah.

1701
01:33:07,279 --> 01:33:10,081
( sighs ) I think the
biggest mistake of my life

1702
01:33:10,115 --> 01:33:12,016
Was not getting married.

1703
01:33:12,051 --> 01:33:14,786
- Excuse me?
- I could've, you know,

1704
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:16,988
Procreated.

1705
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:19,991
Kept the family name alive.

1706
01:33:20,025 --> 01:33:21,559
- Why not?
- Procreate?

1707
01:33:21,593 --> 01:33:24,228
Yowould've made
that big a sacrifice

1708
01:33:24,263 --> 01:33:26,697
To keep the family name alive?
You would've done that?

1709
01:33:28,434 --> 01:33:32,236
Well, sometimes, you've got to
get your hands a little dirty.

1710
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:38,076
Well, could you have
loved though, doc?

1711
01:33:39,011 --> 01:33:40,678
<i>That's the bigger question.</i>

1712
01:33:41,613 --> 01:33:43,881
Could you have loved?

1713
01:33:47,553 --> 01:33:50,088
You didn't put sugar
in here again.

1714
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:54,692
Ah.
Don't get up.

1715
01:33:54,726 --> 01:33:57,528
We need to have
a conversation.

1716
01:33:59,031 --> 01:34:01,299
Mmm.
You know I'm not lugging

1717
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:03,968
This thing around just
'cause it's sexy.

1718
01:34:04,002 --> 01:34:06,871
And you're the only
doctor in my neighborhood

1719
01:34:06,905 --> 01:34:08,940
That practices euthanasia.

1720
01:34:08,974 --> 01:34:11,242
Oh, we're not there yet.

1721
01:34:11,276 --> 01:34:13,044
You've got
plenty of time.

1722
01:34:13,078 --> 01:34:16,380
<i>( crowd chanting on tv ) fieger!
Fieger! Fieger!</i>

1723
01:34:16,415 --> 01:34:20,952
<i>Fieger: Okay okay, let's
keep these signs up.</i>

1724
01:34:20,986 --> 01:34:23,387
Let's keep 'em up there.
Oh, don't drop that.

1725
01:34:23,422 --> 01:34:25,590
( laughs )
did you get a t-shirt?

1726
01:34:25,624 --> 01:34:28,092
<i>Get those buttons
out there.</i>

1727
01:34:28,127 --> 01:34:29,527
<i>Buttons!
Buttons!</i>

1728
01:34:29,561 --> 01:34:31,496
<i>Woman: What is your
official stance</i>

1729
01:34:31,530 --> 01:34:33,297
On the assisted suicide issue?

1730
01:34:33,332 --> 01:34:35,466
I give my word to the
people of michigan

1731
01:34:35,501 --> 01:34:38,336
<i>That I will not be supporting
doctor-assisted suicide.</i>

1732
01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:41,005
<i>Woman: Even with your history with dr.
Kevorkian?</i>

1733
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:43,341
What I've always said
is I support

1734
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:46,277
The individual's right
to choose.

1735
01:34:46,311 --> 01:34:47,912
<i>But I repeat--</i>

1736
01:34:47,946 --> 01:34:50,581
<i>I will not be supporting
doctor-assisted suicide.</i>

1737
01:34:50,616 --> 01:34:52,550
<i>Woman: There you
have it, folks.</i>

1738
01:34:52,584 --> 01:34:54,285
<i>Now back to you, john.</i>

1739
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:56,087
This is megan
from channel 4 news.

1740
01:34:56,121 --> 01:34:58,089
There's something
happening here, people.

1741
01:34:58,123 --> 01:35:01,058
And if you don't know what
it is, it's geoffrey fieger.

1742
01:35:01,093 --> 01:35:04,462
<i>Megan: The 47-year-old fieger's
flare for the dramatic</i>

1743
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:06,931
<i>Has enlivened a campaign
that most analysts</i>

1744
01:35:06,965 --> 01:35:09,267
<i>Said would be
dishwater dull.</i>

1745
01:35:09,301 --> 01:35:11,502
<i>No longer advocating
for kevorkian,</i>

1746
01:35:11,537 --> 01:35:13,638
Fieger is now
advocating for himself

1747
01:35:13,672 --> 01:35:16,107
<i>And campaigning with
michigan voters,</i>

1748
01:35:16,141 --> 01:35:19,443
<i>Lling himself as the
anti-politician.</i>

1749

<i>Fieger: Governor engler is
dumber than dan quayle</i>

1750

<i>And twice as ugly.</i>

1751
01:35:24,683 --> 01:35:26,484
He's a racist
and he's a liar.

<i>Megan: It's the acerbic
tongue of geoffrey fieger's</i>

1753
01:35:29,955 --> 01:35:32,757
That republicans say they'll
make the major issue

1754
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:34,692
Of this upcoming race.

1755
01:35:44,736 --> 01:35:46,404
( camera clicks )

1756
01:35:47,573 --> 01:35:49,473
God had his chance
to come take me.

1757
01:35:49,508 --> 01:35:52,043
I'll go to him instead.

1758
01:35:55,314 --> 01:35:57,682
( gas hissing )

1759
01:36:43,895 --> 01:36:45,730
Are you gonna
look at me, doc?

1760
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:50,401
Or is it
an armenian thing?

1761
01:36:50,435 --> 01:36:54,305
- Is what?
- You know, keeping it all inside,

1762
01:36:54,339 --> 01:36:59,010
Just keep it going.
Is that an armenian thing?

1763
01:36:59,044 --> 01:37:02,280
- Oh, I don't know. - Actually, how
could it be an armenian thing?

1764
01:37:02,314 --> 01:37:05,516
Margo was just as armenian as you
are and she talked my ear off.

1765
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:08,152
( chuckles )
she told me everything.

1766
01:37:08,186 --> 01:37:11,088
She could share.
You don't share.

1767
01:37:11,123 --> 01:37:14,258
What do you
want me to share?

1768
01:37:14,293 --> 01:37:17,495
Anything.
Everything.

1769
01:37:18,797 --> 01:37:21,265
- I'm afraid-- - I know.
I know.

1770
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:24,001
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

1771
01:37:24,036 --> 01:37:26,837
I'm not afraid
for myself, you dope.

1772
01:37:26,872 --> 01:37:28,539
<i>I'm afraid for you.</i>

1773
01:37:29,975 --> 01:37:33,311
Your little band of kevorkians
is shrinking into nothing.

1774
01:37:34,846 --> 01:37:36,981
Will you come closer?
I can't see you right there.

1775
01:37:37,916 --> 01:37:39,183
Here.

1776
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:41,986
- Right here.
- Yes. Okay.

1777
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:43,888
See, you know margo and
I were the only two

1778
01:37:43,922 --> 01:37:46,857
That could tell you to shut up.
( chuckles )

1779
01:37:46,892 --> 01:37:51,195
Look. You need more
people in your corner,

1780
01:37:51,229 --> 01:37:52,997
Not less.

1781
01:37:53,031 --> 01:37:55,132
People that you can trust.

1782
01:37:56,401 --> 01:37:58,869
And the only way people
trust each other

1783
01:37:58,904 --> 01:38:01,105
Is if they know each other.

1784
01:38:01,139 --> 01:38:03,007
And nobody knows you.

1785
01:38:03,041 --> 01:38:04,942
Nobody.

1786
01:38:04,976 --> 01:38:07,745
How did it feel

1787
01:38:07,779 --> 01:38:10,247
When your mother
was dying?

1788
01:38:10,282 --> 01:38:13,184
You were a doctor,
a healer,

1789
01:38:13,218 --> 01:38:16,887
And you were helpless.
How did that feel?

1790
01:38:18,924 --> 01:38:21,859
( sighs )
you know, I failed her.

1791
01:38:21,893 --> 01:38:24,061
I failed my mother.

1792
01:38:26,498 --> 01:38:28,032
And?

1793
01:38:31,403 --> 01:38:33,337
She once said to me

1794
01:38:34,306 --> 01:38:37,074
"imagine, jack,

1795
01:38:37,109 --> 01:38:41,212
The worst toothache
in the world.

1796
01:38:42,247 --> 01:38:45,416
Now imagine
that toothache

1797
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:48,352
Being in every bone
in your body."

1798
01:38:48,387 --> 01:38:50,755
That's--

1799
01:38:50,789 --> 01:38:53,991
That's what was
happening to her.

1800
01:38:56,061 --> 01:39:00,398
<i>She was my mother.
I devoted my life to her.</i>

1801
01:39:01,299 --> 01:39:03,267
So...

1802
01:39:03,301 --> 01:39:05,102
Eh...

1803
01:39:05,137 --> 01:39:07,471
<i>( distant train rattling )</i>

1804
01:39:07,506 --> 01:39:10,441
So how did--
how did you feel?

1805
01:39:19,451 --> 01:39:21,719
I remember--

1806
01:39:23,121 --> 01:39:25,222
I remember being in this
little hospital room--

1807
01:39:25,257 --> 01:39:27,258
This clly little room,

1808
01:39:27,292 --> 01:39:31,195
A lone window
in the red brick wall--

1809
01:39:31,229 --> 01:39:34,131
That's what it faced--

1810
01:39:34,166 --> 01:39:38,002
And all these doctors
circling around my mother

1811
01:39:38,036 --> 01:39:41,238
Trying to keep her alive.

1812
01:39:44,509 --> 01:39:46,811
And I was helpless.

1813
01:39:46,845 --> 01:39:49,380
I was powerless,

1814
01:39:49,414 --> 01:39:51,615
Helpless
and ineffectual.

1815
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:00,157
And I felt

1816
01:40:01,293 --> 01:40:03,394
Lost.

1817
01:40:06,531 --> 01:40:08,632
I walost.

1818
01:40:11,636 --> 01:40:13,771
That's how I felt.

1819

1841
01:42:33,712 --> 01:42:36,880
<i>Man: Dr. Jack kevorkian was

<i>To the supreme court, geoff.</i>

What have we accomplished?

<i>No law has been passed.
I mean, this is the prelude.</i>

1859
01:43:26,197 --> 01:43:29,700
This is the beginning.
The battle of concord,

01:43:29,734 --> 01:43:32,269
<i>- The battle of lexington--
- what are you thinking?</i>

1861
01:43:32,303 --> 01:43:34,338
I'm thinking

1862
01:43:34,372 --> 01:43:36,306
<i>I'm thinking of
going all the way.</i>

1863
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:38,976
If they want to silence me,
let them prosecute me,

1864
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:41,211
Convict me,
send me to jail

1865
01:43:41,246 --> 01:43:42,846
Like martin luther king,

1866
01:43:42,881 --> 01:43:46,116
- Galileo or-- - the supreme
court has already said

1867
01:43:46,151 --> 01:43:49,720
That the states do have the right
to outlaw doctor-assisted suicide!

1868
01:43:49,754 --> 01:43:51,822
See? You don't listen.
You don't listen! They also said

1869
01:43:51,856 --> 01:43:54,558
That they would hear a case
if the right one came along.

1870
01:43:54,592 --> 01:43:57,695
If it was for a particularly
suffering individual,

1871
01:43:57,729 --> 01:44:00,898
They would hear it.
You don't listen.

1872
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,567
<i>( door closes )</i>

<i>Your wishes with your

1876
01:44:25,256 --> 01:44:28,258
Do they want you

01:44:29,494 --> 01:44:31,195
( slurring ) yes,

1878
01:44:31,229 --> 01:44:33,897
They understand

1879
01:44:33,932 --> 01:44:36,400
Why.

1880
01:44:37,969 --> 01:44:42,005
It's my decision.

1881
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:44,842
He's saying, "it's my decision.
"

1882
01:44:47,946 --> 01:44:49,646
Okay.

1883
01:44:49,681 --> 01:44:51,882
Now, tom,

1884
01:44:51,916 --> 01:44:55,986
I will be administering
direct lethal injection,

1885
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:58,555
What's called "active
euthanasia."

1886
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:01,825
<i>You don't want to
wait a month or so?</i>

1887
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:03,527
No, I do not.

1888
01:45:03,561 --> 01:45:07,197
<i>Jack: How about two weeks?
Two weeks?</i>

1889
01:45:07,232 --> 01:45:09,199
<i>No.</i>

1890
01:45:09,234 --> 01:45:12,669
<i>A week?
Can you wait a week?</i>

1891
01:45:13,738 --> 01:45:15,405
Yeah.

1892
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:19,710
<i>Okay. Okay, we'll stretch
it out another week.</i>

1893
01:45:19,744 --> 01:45:22,346
You're doing
the deed yourself?

1894
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:26,016
This is really crossing
into uncharted territory.

1895
01:45:26,050 --> 01:45:30,154
Well, so I set sail.

1896
01:45:30,188 --> 01:45:34,258
Rudderless, I admit,

1897
01:45:34,292 --> 01:45:37,094
But that's the way it goes.

1898
01:45:37,128 --> 01:45:40,697
Jack on tv: This is gonna allow
me to do direct lethal injection.

1899
01:45:40,732 --> 01:45:43,000
<i>Jack:
I'm all alone, neal,</i>

1900
01:45:43,034 --> 01:45:45,536
<i>And I'm running
out of time.</i>

1901
01:45:50,942 --> 01:45:53,911
That first day
35 years ago

1902
01:45:53,945 --> 01:45:56,880
You came down
to the basement lab

1903
01:45:56,915 --> 01:45:59,583
And talked
to all us med techs.

1904
01:45:59,617 --> 01:46:01,985
You were the only doctor
in our whole hospital

1905
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:05,422
We didn't think was a
pompous son of a bitch.

1906
01:46:05,456 --> 01:46:07,391
Well, that was
your first mistake.

1907
01:46:07,425 --> 01:46:09,593
( chuckles )

1908
01:46:09,627 --> 01:46:12,196
I let you stick
needles in me,

1909
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:15,232
Transfuse cadaver blood.

1910
01:46:16,668 --> 01:46:19,403
Shit, you weren't the only one
that got hepatitis, jack.

1911
01:46:20,905 --> 01:46:23,407
Hell, we h
some good times.

1912
01:46:23,441 --> 01:46:26,009
<i>( chuckles ) you had
purpose, jack.</i>

1913
01:46:27,312 --> 01:46:30,180
<i>You had purpose and I
guess I needed some too.</i>

1914
01:46:31,583 --> 01:46:34,551
And I know that
this is your decision,

1915
01:46:36,421 --> 01:46:39,990
But if you decide to pull the
plug on somebody yourself,

1916
01:46:40,024 --> 01:46:41,625
You're gonna
be flying solo.

1917
01:46:48,399 --> 01:46:50,534
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

1918
01:46:56,107 --> 01:46:59,576

I'm-- I'm sorry
to call so late,

1920
01:47:01,846 --> 01:47:03,247
But it's tom.

1921
01:47:03,281 --> 01:47:05,482
<i>He can't wait
any longer.</i>

1922
01:47:05,516 --> 01:47:07,651
<i>He's terrified.</i>

1923
01:47:08,953 --> 01:47:10,954
Oh, okay.
Okay.

1924
01:47:10,989 --> 01:47:13,123
I'm on my way.

1925
01:47:13,157 --> 01:47:15,525
Just say your
goodbyes then, melody,

1926
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:18,295
Because I don't want anyone to
be there when I do this thing.

1927
01:47:18,329 --> 01:47:20,731

<i>- Jack.

01:47:52,964 --> 01:47:54,698
Look what I got.

1932
01:47:58,903 --> 01:48:01,405
I want
a national debate on ts,

1933
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:04,041
Because once that happens,
they have to charge me.

1934
01:48:04,075 --> 01:48:06,910
- They have no choice, right?
- With murder, maybe.

1935
01:48:06,945 --> 01:48:09,212
I want to put
euthanasia on trial.

1936
01:48:09,247 --> 01:48:11,448
Let the people decide
if it's murder or not.

1937
01:48:11,482 --> 01:48:12,983
You want
to sacrifice yourself?

1938
01:48:13,017 --> 01:48:15,319
Because you'd go to prison
for the rest of your life.

1939
01:48:15,353 --> 01:48:17,220
You know I know
barbara walte.

1940
01:48:17,255 --> 01:48:19,456
She likes me,

1941
01:48:19,490 --> 01:48:21,258
But I want
a bigger audience.

1942
01:48:21,292 --> 01:48:24,661
You know mike wallace,
don't you?

1943
01:48:26,631 --> 01:48:28,799
No, I under-- yeah.

1944
01:48:29,901 --> 01:48:31,401
I mean if--

1945
01:48:31,436 --> 01:48:33,136
If you put him
on the air,

1946
01:48:33,171 --> 01:48:35,839
Will you be dealing with
a rational human being?

1947
01:48:35,873 --> 01:48:39,509
Well, I can't promise rational
with kevorkian, mike.

1948
01:48:39,544 --> 01:48:42,279
But if you're asking
if he's sane,

1949
01:48:42,313 --> 01:48:44,715
I'd say yes.

1950
01:48:44,749 --> 01:48:47,651
He knows exactly
what he's doing.

To quash all the charges against dr.
Kevorkian.

2070
01:54:20,351 --> 01:54:22,619
Theris
no basis to dismiss.

2071
01:54:22,653 --> 01:54:25,155
But I do think there
is an argument here

2072
01:54:25,189 --> 01:54:27,490
That murder
and assisted suicide are

2073
01:54:27,525 --> 01:54:29,459
Incompatible charges
by definition.

2074
01:54:29,493 --> 01:54:33,830
Well, that may be something to be
debated in a law school class,

2075
01:54:33,864 --> 01:54:35,632
But not in my courtroom.

2076
01:54:35,666 --> 01:54:38,601
And, mr. Skrzynski, I'm
granting your motion

2077
01:54:38,636 --> 01:54:40,236
To limit testimony
on the murder charge

2078
01:54:40,271 --> 01:54:42,605
<i>But not
on assisted suicide.</i>

2079
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:45,075
A person's pain and
suffering is very relevant

2080
01:54:45,109 --> 01:54:48,478
When defending an
assisted suicide charge.

2081
01:54:48,512 --> 01:54:50,447
The trial starts
in five days.

2082
01:54:50,481 --> 01:54:52,182
Jack:
Okay, thank you.

2083
01:54:54,952 --> 01:54:57,187
It just occurred to me--

2084
01:54:58,823 --> 01:55:02,025
Why don't we drop the assisted
suicide charge altogether?

2085
01:55:04,195 --> 01:55:06,029
What are you saying?

2086
01:55:07,264 --> 01:55:10,367
I'm saying that
what proved lethal

2087
01:55:10,401 --> 01:55:12,535
In all our other cases was

2088
01:55:12,570 --> 01:55:14,604
The family members
testifying,

2089
01:55:14,638 --> 01:55:18,241
Juries hearing about the
conditions of the victims,

2090
01:55:18,275 --> 01:55:19,943
How much pain
they were in

2091
01:55:19,977 --> 01:55:21,911
And all that bullshit.

2092
01:55:21,946 --> 01:55:24,314
So if we drop
the charge,

2093
01:55:24,348 --> 01:55:25,749
Make it all
or nothing on murder,

2094
01:55:25,783 --> 01:55:28,118

the brother--

2095
01:55:28,152 --> 01:55:30,587
Theyon't get

2096
01:55:30,621 --> 01:55:32,822
Precisely.

2097
01:55:32,857 --> 01:55:35,759

No.

disrupt or inconvenience the court

2112

01:56:27,478 --> 01:56:29,446

"bring me jack kevorkian.

2119
01:56:39,423 --> 01:56:40,857
Doctors are
supposed to uphold

2120
01:56:40,891 --> 01:56:43,193
The hippocratic oath,
though, save lives.

2121
01:56:43,227 --> 01:56:44,761
Some people are dying

2122
01:56:44,795 --> 01:56:47,964
And they should be dying
gracefully with dignity and honor.

2123
01:56:47,998 --> 01:56:49,766
But I don't think we ought to put
them out to pasture this way.

Well, if she was
mentally competent,

2133
01:57:07,384 --> 01:57:09,285
I would ask her
what she wanted

2134

<i>Skrzynski: Objection.
That's a legal question.</i>

2147
01:57:42,419 --> 01:57:45,889
Sir, you may question him in
regard to his autopsy report,

2148
01:57:45,923 --> 01:57:48,157
But nothing further
that's legal.

2149
01:57:48,192 --> 01:57:50,560
- But why? Look, I-- -
judge: If you had consulted

2150
01:57:50,594 --> 01:57:52,362
<i>Your attorney, he'd
tell you why.</i>

2151
01:57:54,031 --> 01:57:57,567
Uh, okay.

2152
01:57:59,336 --> 01:58:01,271
<i>- Is euthanasia always murder?
- Skrzynski: Objection.</i>

2153
01:58:02,706 --> 01:58:05,475
Always homicide?

2154
01:58:05,509 --> 01:58:08,745
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, it's always homicide.

2155
01:58:08,779 --> 01:58:11,748
And you stated
that homicide

2156
01:58:11,782 --> 01:58:15,485
Is not necessarily
always murder.

2157
01:58:15,519 --> 01:58:17,287
Therefore...

2158
01:58:18,656 --> 01:58:20,990
Out of pure logic,
wouldn't you say

2159
01:58:21,025 --> 01:58:23,593
That euthanasia is
not always murder?

2160
01:58:23,627 --> 01:58:25,662
<i>Skrzynski: Objection.
Calls for a legal conclusion.</i>

2161
01:58:25,696 --> 01:58:28,431
<i>Jack: No, it calls
for simple logic.</i>

2162
01:58:28,465 --> 01:58:31,267
<i>It's-- it's--
it's a syllogism.</i>

2163
01:58:31,302 --> 01:58:33,403
<i>It calls for nothing
but syllogism.</i>

2164
01:58:33,437 --> 01:58:36,306
Again, you're asking him to
make a legal conclusion.

2165
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:38,575
No, but this is a
mathematical conclusion.

2166
01:58:38,609 --> 01:58:40,076
<i>It's simple arithmetic.</i>

2167
01:58:40,110 --> 01:58:42,512
I don't know shit
about the law either,

2168
01:58:42,546 --> 01:58:44,847
But I know when I'm
watching a train wreck.

2169
01:58:44,882 --> 01:58:46,916
Yeah, well, I told him
gorosh is a putz.

2170
01:58:46,951 --> 01:58:49,385
<i>It can't possibly
be a fair fight.</i>

2171
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:53,056
You gotta do something, geoff.
Anything.

2172
01:58:55,726 --> 01:58:57,627
- Dr. Kevorkian.
- Oh.

2173
01:58:57,661 --> 01:59:00,496
Tom's brother's flight
from France

2174
01:59:00,531 --> 01:59:03,499
Got delayed,
but he will be here soon.

2175
01:59:03,534 --> 01:59:05,501
Okay, don't worry.

2176
01:59:05,536 --> 01:59:08,338
We'rgonna get you both
on the stand to testify.

2177
01:59:08,372 --> 01:59:12,075
I know you want to call melody
youk as your first witness,

2178
01:59:12,109 --> 01:59:14,677
But what is it that she's
going to testify to?

2179
01:59:14,712 --> 01:59:18,147
Well, she's going to
testify about my intent,

2180
01:59:18,182 --> 01:59:21,684
<i>What she observed and
our discussions--</i>

2181
01:59:21,719 --> 01:59:24,687
Dr. Kevorkian, that has
no relevance here.

2182
01:59:24,722 --> 01:59:27,890
I assumed your counsel would've
advised you about this,

2183
01:59:27,925 --> 01:59:31,394
That once the assisted
suicide charge was dropped,

2184
01:59:31,428 --> 01:59:33,997
You could no longer put these
witnesses before the jury.

2185
01:59:34,031 --> 01:59:35,798
Yeah, but I'm talking
about what went on,

2186
01:59:35,833 --> 01:59:37,667
You know,
as to my intent.

2187
01:59:37,701 --> 01:59:40,470
Your feeling compelled to help mr.
Youk

2188
01:59:40,504 --> 01:59:42,271
<i>Is not a legal defense,</i>

2189
01:59:42,306 --> 01:59:44,707
<i>And you're already aware
that a person's condition</i>

2190
01:59:44,742 --> 01:59:46,576
<i>Has no bearing in
a murder case.</i>

2191
01:59:46,610 --> 01:59:48,711
But that I didn't kill
her husband, you see.

2192
01:59:48,746 --> 01:59:50,780
- This is relevant.
- Okay. Okay.

2193
01:59:50,814 --> 01:59:52,482
We'll make
a special record

2194
01:59:52,516 --> 01:59:54,150
Outside the presence
of the jury.

2195
01:59:54,184 --> 01:59:55,985
I will rule on that.

2196
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:57,487
- Okay.
- All right?

2197
01:59:57,521 --> 01:59:59,589
- Can I-- okay.
Thank you. - Thank you.

2198
01:59:59,623 --> 02:00:02,725
<i>Jack:
Melody, did you tell me</i>

2199
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:04,560
<i>It was your intention</i>

2200
02:00:04,595 --> 02:00:06,896
<i>Or tom's intention</i>

2201
02:00:06,930 --> 02:00:09,799
<i>- That I kill him?
- Melody: Oh, no no no no.</i>

2202
02:00:09,833 --> 02:00:11,267
<i>That was not our intent.</i>

2203
02:00:11,301 --> 02:00:14,804
And when I met you, I felt
it was not your intent.

2204
02:00:14,838 --> 02:00:18,074
It was never your intent
or our intent that tom--

2205
02:00:18,108 --> 02:00:20,176
<i>Jack: There it is.
There it is. You see?</i>

2206
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:24,047
--Other than released
from suffering.

2207
02:00:24,081 --> 02:00:27,550
So the word "kill," did it ever crop up?
Or "murder"?

2208
02:00:27,584 --> 02:00:29,752
No.
No.

2209
02:00:29,787 --> 02:00:31,487
Ugly words.

2210
02:00:31,522 --> 02:00:34,057
Ugly ugly words.

2211
02:00:37,861 --> 02:00:40,863
You're talking
about mercy killing.

2212
02:00:40,898 --> 02:00:44,267
<i>And her statements
can't show</i>

2213
02:00:44,301 --> 02:00:46,903
Your state of mind.
They only show hers.

2214
02:00:46,937 --> 02:00:50,707
Therefore, I cannot allow her
to testify before the jury.

2215
02:00:50,741 --> 02:00:52,075
But wait.
I want to say something--

2216
02:00:52,109 --> 02:00:54,210
That-- I have
so much I want to say.

2217
02:00:54,244 --> 02:00:58,347
I have been waiting for four goddamn
months for this opportunity!

2218
02:00:58,382 --> 02:01:01,150
You may call it
mercy killing.

2219
02:01:01,185 --> 02:01:03,119
I call
it something else.

2220
02:01:03,153 --> 02:01:05,021
I call it
a medical service

2221
02:01:05,055 --> 02:01:08,024
For an agonized, incurably
suffering patient.

2222
02:01:08,058 --> 02:01:09,459
That's what I call it.
All right?

2223
02:01:09,493 --> 02:01:11,861
Why don't-- what difference
does it make what you call it?

2224
02:01:11,895 --> 02:01:15,164
When you have these fine
stipulations of law

2225
02:01:15,199 --> 02:01:17,033
Standing in the way of a
dedicated physician--

2226
02:01:17,067 --> 02:01:20,536
And I am
a dedicated physician.

2227
02:01:20,571 --> 02:01:23,239
I mean, my integrity
would be destroyed

2228
02:01:23,273 --> 02:01:25,475
If I turned my back
on that patient.

2229
02:01:25,509 --> 02:01:28,111
I would rather
be dead.

2230
02:01:28,145 --> 02:01:30,146
It-- it's far worse.

2231
02:01:30,180 --> 02:01:33,182
You could-- you could take my life.
It would be worse.

2232
02:01:33,217 --> 02:01:36,652
This was a service.
This was a service.

2233
02:01:36,687 --> 02:01:39,789
It had nothing to do
with "kill" or "murder"

2234
02:01:39,823 --> 02:01:41,357
- Or wh-- it was a service.
- ( sobbing )

2235
02:01:41,391 --> 02:01:43,893
It was a medical service
that was being done.

2236
02:01:43,927 --> 02:01:45,862
I can't be clearer.

2237
02:01:45,896 --> 02:01:47,497
I can't be clearer
than that, your honor.

2238
02:01:51,401 --> 02:01:53,503
I see the emotion,

2239
02:01:53,537 --> 02:01:56,205
I understand it, but
it's not relevant.

2240
02:01:58,041 --> 02:02:00,877
Please step down, mrs.
Youk.

2241
02:02:06,383 --> 02:02:10,820
Jessica cooper has already ruled that dr.
Kevorkian's side

2242
02:02:10,854 --> 02:02:13,689
Can't put into evidence that
there was suffering here

2243
02:02:13,724 --> 02:02:15,858
By the victim.
Does that make any sense?

2244
02:02:15,893 --> 02:02:17,994
No, 'cause, see, I think
it's an improper ruling

2245
02:02:18,028 --> 02:02:20,696
<i>Both in terms of the
nature of this trial</i>

2246
02:02:20,731 --> 02:02:22,865
<i>And criminal defenses
in general.</i>

2247
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:25,935
You're entitled to put forward
any plausible defense

2248
02:02:25,969 --> 02:02:27,436
To explain
the context of your act,

2249
02:02:27,471 --> 02:02:31,007
<i>And she's already limited
him from doing that.</i>

2250
02:02:31,041 --> 02:02:32,742
It's like watching
a man hang himself.

2251
02:02:32,776 --> 02:02:34,310
I've been watching
the television.

2252
02:02:34,344 --> 02:02:36,546
Once you knew they were dropping
the assisted suicide charge,

2253
02:02:36,580 --> 02:02:38,781
- What was your plan?
- He doesn't let me help him.

2254
02:02:38,816 --> 02:02:40,883
- Hey, what am I supposed to do?
- You're supposed to

2255
02:02:40,918 --> 02:02:42,685
Get creative, that's what
you're supposed to do.

2256
02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:44,687
Why didn't you argue that
youk's wife and brother

2257
02:02:44,721 --> 02:02:46,422
Were eyewitnesses
to the event

2258
02:02:46,456 --> 02:02:48,124
That the prosecutor's
calling a murder?

2259
02:02:48,158 --> 02:02:50,193
<i>Then judge cooper would've had
to have let them testify.</i>

2260
02:02:50,227 --> 02:02:51,928
But that window's
closed now.

2261
02:02:51,962 --> 02:02:55,164
- Did you ever pass the fucking bar exam?
- ( elevator dings )

2262
02:02:58,669 --> 02:03:00,803
Dave.

2263
02:03:04,408 --> 02:03:07,276
There are those who would say about dr.
Jack kevorkian,

2264
02:03:07,311 --> 02:03:09,378
"right message,
wrong messenger."

2265
02:03:09,413 --> 02:03:11,447
And who is
the right messenger?

2266
02:03:13,016 --> 02:03:15,084
Uh...

2267
02:03:15,118 --> 02:03:17,854
Now I'm confused about this, dr.
Kevorkian.

2268
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:19,689
<i>You said you had
another witness.</i>

2269
02:03:19,723 --> 02:03:23,092
I'm not allowing
his testimony

2270
02:03:23,126 --> 02:03:26,028
On the same grounds I
didn't allow mrs. Youk's.

2271
02:03:26,063 --> 02:03:29,765
I'm sorry you flew all this way, mr.
Youk.

2272
02:03:32,236 --> 02:03:33,803
Would you like
to take the stand

2273
02:03:33,837 --> 02:03:36,205
In your own defense, dr.
Kevorkian?

2274
02:03:52,990 --> 02:03:53,055
( whispers )
I'm sorry.

2275
02:03:54,691 --> 02:03:58,394
<i>Cooper: Sir, would you
like to take the stand</i>

2276
02:03:58,428 --> 02:04:01,197
<i>- In your own defense?
- Oh, I heard you.</i>

2277
02:04:01,231 --> 02:04:03,232
I did.

2278
02:04:11,141 --> 02:04:12,842
Um.

2279
02:04:18,081 --> 02:04:20,182
You know,
I don't lie

2280
02:04:20,217 --> 02:04:24,687
And I-- I--
I don't exaggerate.

2281
02:04:29,159 --> 02:04:32,929
And, um, you know,
you never said why.

2282
02:04:32,963 --> 02:04:37,099
You accuse me
of these heinous things,

2283
02:04:37,134 --> 02:04:39,802
But you never said why.
Did you?

2284
02:04:39,836 --> 02:04:42,538
No, just saying.
I'm just saying.

2285
02:04:42,572 --> 02:04:45,041
You know,
just so you know.

2286
02:04:45,075 --> 02:04:48,811
<i>Cooper: Sir, let's keep
to the relevance here.</i>

2287
02:04:48,845 --> 02:04:50,980
Oh, this is--
oh, it's not relevant?

2288
02:04:51,014 --> 02:04:53,316
I guess it's not.

2289
02:04:53,350 --> 02:04:54,684
It's not relevant.

2290
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:58,387
Uh.

2291
02:04:58,422 --> 02:05:00,222
<i>Cooper:
I will ask you again.</i>

2292
02:05:00,257 --> 02:05:04,660
<i>Would you like to take the stand
in your own defense, sir?</i>

2293
02:05:17,274 --> 02:05:19,208
<i>It's now or never.</i>

2294
02:05:19,242 --> 02:05:21,110
Never.

2295
02:05:23,914 --> 02:05:26,649
No.
No.

2296
02:05:28,952 --> 02:05:32,555
The defense...
Rests.

2297
02:05:35,425 --> 02:05:38,427
<i>Skrzynski: Not since
ruby killed oswald</i>

2298
02:05:38,462 --> 02:05:41,230
<i>Did we see a murder
on television.</i>

2299
02:05:42,566 --> 02:05:46,268
<i>Jack kevorkian came like
a hit man in the night</i>

2300
02:05:46,303 --> 02:05:50,039
<i>With a bag of poison
to do his job.</i>

2301
02:05:50,073 --> 02:05:53,075
What would happen
if he got his way

2302
02:05:53,110 --> 02:05:55,845
And made
the state policy
euthanasia?

2303
02:05:55,879 --> 02:05:57,813
What could go wrong?

2304
02:05:57,848 --> 02:06:01,117
Well, there are 11 million
souls buried in europe...

2305
02:06:01,151 --> 02:06:03,319
<i>- Oh! - ...
That can tell you that when you make</i>

2306
02:06:03,353 --> 02:06:05,187
Euthanasia
a state policy

2307
02:06:05,222 --> 02:06:06,789
Some catastrophic things
can evolve

2308
02:06:06,823 --> 02:06:08,758
- From opening up that box.
- How dare you?!

2309
02:06:08,792 --> 02:06:10,292
- How dare you...
- Cooper: Dr. Kevorkian!

2310
02:06:10,327 --> 02:06:12,962
<i>- ...Compare euthanasia with the genocide?!
- ( gavel pounding )</i>

2311
02:06:12,996 --> 02:06:15,831
<i>- How dare you!
- Melody: You have crossed the line!</i>

2312
02:06:15,866 --> 02:06:18,334
<i>- Where is your decency and respect?
- Cooper: Order in the court.</i>

2313
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:21,070
Order in this court.

2314
02:06:21,104 --> 02:06:24,240
We will take
a brief recess.

2315
02:06:24,274 --> 02:06:26,375
( people whispering )

2316
02:06:32,215 --> 02:06:34,850
Do you see
a criminal?

2317
02:06:37,020 --> 02:06:39,188
Do you see
a murderer?

2318
02:06:39,222 --> 02:06:41,323
If you do,

2319
02:06:41,358 --> 02:06:43,793
Then you--
you must convict.

2320
02:06:45,829 --> 02:06:50,232
And then take the harsh
judgment of history

2321
02:06:50,267 --> 02:06:55,171
And the even harsher
judgment of your children

2322
02:06:55,205 --> 02:06:59,108
And their children if
they should ever come

2323
02:06:59,142 --> 02:07:02,378
To need this choe
in their lives.

2324
02:07:03,914 --> 02:07:06,982
I just ask you
to think about that.

2325
02:07:19,162 --> 02:07:22,298
Guilty of the lesser charge
of second-degree murder.

2326
02:07:22,332 --> 02:07:24,433
<i>- ( murmuring )
- woman: Yes.</i>

2327
02:07:25,702 --> 02:07:27,169
<i>Cooper: And with
regard to count two,</i>

2328
02:07:27,204 --> 02:07:28,871
<i>What is yourerdict?</i>

2329
02:07:28,905 --> 02:07:32,808
<i>Woman #2: Guilty of delivery
of a controlled substance.</i>

2330
02:07:38,882 --> 02:07:42,084
<i>Woman: He's out of time.
Yes.</i>

2331
02:07:42,119 --> 02:07:47,022
You invited yourself here
to make a final stand.

2332
02:07:47,057 --> 02:07:49,859
You invited yourself
to the wrong forum.

2333
02:07:49,893 --> 02:07:53,429
<i>Our nation tolerates
differences of opinions</i>

2334
02:07:53,463 --> 02:07:55,965
<i>Because we have a civilized
and non-violent way</i>

2335
02:07:55,999 --> 02:07:57,967
<i>Of resolving
our conflicts.</i>

2336
02:07:58,001 --> 02:08:00,369
We have the means
and methods

2337
02:08:00,403 --> 02:08:02,538
To protest laws with
which we disagree.

2338
02:08:02,572 --> 02:08:05,274
<i>You can criticize
the law,</i>

2339
02:08:05,308 --> 02:08:06,909
<i>Lecture about the law,</i>

2340
02:08:06,943 --> 02:08:09,912
<i>Speak to the media
or petition voters,</i>

2341
02:08:09,946 --> 02:08:12,381
<i>But you must always stay</i>

2342
02:08:12,415 --> 02:08:14,183
Within the limits
provided by the law.

2343
02:08:14,217 --> 02:08:16,118
<i>You may not
break the law</i>

2344
02:08:16,153 --> 02:08:18,754
<i>Or take the law into
your own hands.</i>

2345
02:08:18,788 --> 02:08:21,557
<i>No one's unmindful</i>

2346
02:08:21,591 --> 02:08:24,760
<i>Of the controversy and
emotion that exists</i>

2347
02:08:24,794 --> 02:08:27,463
<i>Over end-of-life issues
and pain control.</i>

2348
02:08:27,497 --> 02:08:30,232
<i>I assume the debate
will continue</i>

2349
02:08:30,267 --> 02:08:33,669
<i>In a calm and reasoned forum
long after this trial</i>

2350
02:08:33,703 --> 02:08:37,506
<i>And your activities have faded
from the public memory.</i>

2351
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:40,709
But this trial was not
about that controversy.

2352
02:08:40,744 --> 02:08:43,345
This trial was
about you, sir.

2353
02:08:44,347 --> 02:08:46,081
<i>You've ignored
and challenged</i>

2354
02:08:46,116 --> 02:08:48,851
<i>The legislature and
the supreme court.</i>

2355
02:08:48,885 --> 02:08:51,921
Moreover, you've defied your
own medical profession.

2356
02:08:51,955 --> 02:08:54,924
<i>This trial was about
lawlessness,</i>

2357
02:08:54,958 --> 02:08:57,893
<i>About your disregard
for a society</i>

2358
02:08:57,928 --> 02:08:59,762
<i>That exists
and flourishes</i>

2359
02:08:59,796 --> 02:09:02,198
<i>Because of the strength
of our legal system.</i>

2360
02:09:02,232 --> 02:09:05,301
No one is
above the law.

2361
02:09:07,537 --> 02:09:10,973
<i>You had the audacity to go
on national television,</i>

2362
02:09:11,007 --> 02:09:12,641
<i>Show the world
what you did,</i>

2363
02:09:12,676 --> 02:09:15,010
<i>And dare the legal
system to stop you.</i>

2364
02:09:15,045 --> 02:09:18,647
<i>You publicly and repeatedly
announced your intentions</i>

2365
02:09:18,682 --> 02:09:21,016
<i>To disregard the
laws of michigan.</i>

2366
02:09:21,051 --> 02:09:23,786
Because of this,
I am imposing

2367
02:09:23,820 --> 02:09:27,189
The maximum sentence
of 10 to 25 years.

2368
02:09:27,224 --> 02:09:28,791
You may now, sir,

2369
02:09:28,825 --> 02:09:30,926
Consider yourself stopped.

2370
02:09:30,961 --> 02:09:34,363
<i>- ( clapping ) - man: Yeah, doc!
Yeah, doc!</i>

2371
02:09:34,397 --> 02:09:37,166
<i>Man #2: You the man, jack!
You the man!</i>

2372
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:39,301
( men cheering )

2373
02:09:41,371 --> 02:09:44,406
<i>Man #3:
Hey, jack!</i>

2374
02:10:04,761 --> 02:10:06,862
( silence )

2375
02:10:11,067 --> 02:10:13,035
<i>( door clangs )</i>

2376
02:10:37,627 --> 02:10:40,929
<i>- ( jazz music playing )
- ( people vocalizing )</i>

2377
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:24,773
<i>( classical score playing )</i>
