00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,754
[Man] "In the final moments
of a marathon...

3
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,765
"two runners, 'A'and 'B',

4
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,860
"Pass a point that is 100 meters from
the finish line at the same time...

5
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:42,067
"and then run the final 100 meters
of the race at different constant speeds.

6
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,200
"After the runners
pass the point...

7
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,747
"'A'runs 80 meters
in the time 'B'runs 60 meters.

8
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,444
How many meters will 'B'have left in the race
when 'A'reaches the finish line?"

9
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,453
Let's see.

10
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:59,218
Well, "A"is winning, right,
by 60... no, 80 meters...

11
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,885
but at different
constant speeds.

12
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:05,089
So "B"could catch up. I mean,
if B's constant speed...

13
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,756
should somehow...

14
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,061
But this could be
one of those trick questions.

15
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,194
- [Siren Blares]
- "A"has to win, right? Yeah.

16
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:15,240
"A"must win by...
Oh, God. Who knows?

17
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,571
Oh, I don't know the answer.

18
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,111
- [Thud]
- Hey!

19
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,113
What the hell's going on here?

20
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,513
Well, l-l-I'm no good
on the math part.

21
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,448
You're a moron. It's easy!

22
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,681
You should have been in the verbal section.
I have to think this over again.

23
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,121
"Over again."
Forget it. I'm exhausted.

24
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,523
I'll run it again.
You know, no problem.

25
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,618
- You would.
- Give him a break.

26
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,596
It's just some junior
sweating out his S.A.T.'s.

27
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,826
Hey, who gives a shit?

28
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,995
You got a problem? Afraid I'll win?
Is that what's happening?

29
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,302
- You can't win. You're "B." You're never gonna win!
- Oh, really?

30
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:52,936
You are a disgrace
to the entire alphabet.

31
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,946
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

32
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,278
- Alphabetize this!
- [Groans]

33
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,275
[Man]
Ladies and gentlemen...

34
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,082
this is a shocking situation unfolding
at the finish line.

35
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,181
And yet wasn't the outcome
entirely predictable...

36
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,487
with our athletes
counting on...

37
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,497
- Marlon Browne?
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

38
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,193
You guys should have been
in Jessica Kailo's S.A.T.'s.

39
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,496
You'd be drinking
Gatorade by now.

40
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,300
Are you copying?

41
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,465
Mm-mmm. Nope.
I'm fine. Thanks.

42
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,158

00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,210
[Bell Rings]

44
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,473
Okay, gang. That's all.
Let's go. Let's hand them in.

45
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,647
Here you go, Mrs. Wyler.

46
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,047
- How do you think you did, Marlon?
- I don't know.

47
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,052
It's hard to tell
from a bunch of dots.

48
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,612
Well, I'm sure you did fine.
I'm sure you did fine.

49
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,919
Oh!

50
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,393
It's nothing. Really.
Uh, h-have a good semester.

51
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,064
Oh, dear.

52
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,429
Oh, dear.

53
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:17,719
[Man Singing]

54
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,922
Are you gonna take
the S.A. T.'s again next month?

55
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:31,163
I have to. With the scores I have now, I can
only get into the schools I'd never go to.

56
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,102
Kel, it's one
overrated test.

57
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,369
Yeah, well, you can say that, Jessica,
'cause you have really great scores.

58
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,503
You guys, we gotta ease up. If we're this
crazy now, what's it gonna be like in April?

59
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,309
I'm not gonna make it to April.
I know it.

60
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,852
I heard about one girl who lost it so bad
she went into a mental institution.

61
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,821
You mean the one that really cracked
and took off all her clothes in the interview?

62
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,118
Oh, yeah.
Did you hear what happened?

63
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,194
[Kel]
No.

64
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,963
It was terrible because
when she went in for her interview...

65
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:04,059
she was completely, totally prepared
to discuss the nuclear freeze...

66
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,331
drug abuse,
violence in movies...

67
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,272
all the important issues.

68
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,570
But you know what
the interviewer did instead?

69
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,475
He hit her with
a stress question.

70
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,140
- Bastard.
- Just to watch her squirm, he asked...

71
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,152
"If you could be any major household
appliance, which one would it be and why?"

72
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,586
- [Groans]
- She blurted out "vacuum cleaner,"

73
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,590
but couldn't back it up.

74
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,626
It was all downhill
after that.

75
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,786
No matter what she said,
he wasn't interested.

76
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,558
Finally, he turns to her
and says...

77
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,634
"Looks like
your time's up, miss...

78
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,932
unless you have anything else interesting
you'd like to reveal about yourself."

79
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,835
- And that's when she...
- [Gasps]

80
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,341
Someone told me
she's still in the hospital.

81
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,537
- No, she's dead.
- [Gasps]

82
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,843
- Slit her wrists with the application form.
- That's how she did it?

83
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,585
- Duh!
- [Sighs]

84
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,587
Come on, you guys.
I was joking.

85
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,920
Every year people pass around
these stories about the kid who cracked.

86
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,926
Someone just made it up
to scare us.

87
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,553
Yeah, well,
it worked for me. I'm scared.

88
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,292
- I'm terrified.
- I think getting into college...

89
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,493
is just like
any other campaign.

90
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,900
And we just need
a little bit of strategy.

91
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:16,600
That's why I asked my parents
to move to Montana... to help me
get into some east coast schools.

92
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,644
- Well, I don't think it's that crazy.
- [Snickering]

93
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,611
I'm sure gonna
miss my dog though.

94
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,586
You're staring at me again, Marlon.
[Kissing Sounds]

95
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,385
Don't do this, Oliver.
I'm weak from unrequited love.

96
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,326
Talk to her about it and end this twisted
childhood obsession with Jessica Kailo.

97
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,795
This is true love.
How many people do you know...

98
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,991
who really end up with
their high school sweethearts?

99
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,126
What are you gonna do?
Wait till you get to college to talk to her?

100
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,173
I have seen a myriad of men come and go through
Jessica Kailo's life since the sixth grade.

101
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:52,176
I am not going to make
those same mistakes. I'm committed.

102
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,337
- You should be committed.
- I know.

103
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,280
- I know. You have bigger plans.
- Of course I do.

104
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,408
What's it gonna take
to convince you of that?

105
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,613
Forget about
this "go to college" crap.

106
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,714
What's wrong with
experiencing the real world?

107
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,158
Look, we get out of high school,
we stick out our thumbs and pow!

108
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,355
We got a four-year
jump on everybody.

109
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,763
We may even run amok with
rebel game show hostesses...

110
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,597
traveling the world
with unclaimed vacation prizes.

111
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,171
I'm sorry, Oliver.
I don't buy into the theory...

112
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,173
that on day one of real life...

113
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,574
we stick out our thumbs and
pow... Vanna White picks us up...

114
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,670
and drives us off into
a bright and exciting tomorrow.

115
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,944
Well, I don't buy into the theory
that getting a college education...

116
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,179
has gotta revolve entirely
around the possibility...

117
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,052
ofJessica Kailo finally
giving you the time of day!

118
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,216
[All Talking Stops]

119
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,790
- It's 12:30.
- Thank you.

120
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,797
Sure.

121
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,037
[Jessica Laughing]

122
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,129
[Jessica]
Here we go.

123
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,538
Hi, Mrs. Elzwitt-Marcato-Hazelbaum.
I'm here to see Mrs. Wyler.

124
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,339
- Oh.
- I'll be with you in a minute, Jessica.

125
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,680
Okay, thanks,
Mrs. Wyler.

126
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,887
Hi, Martin.

127
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,753
Marlon... Browne.

128
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:16,818
- Are you gonna vote for me?
- Oh, vote for you i-in the election.

129
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,557
For class president.
Uh, of course, you don't have to.

130
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,157
I would love to. Why don't you give me
a button, and I'll do publicity for you.

131
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,669
- Buttons are a dollar.
- Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:30,504
- Oh, all right.
- No, it's a joke. It's a joke.

133
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,845
They're just kidding you.

134
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,778
There you go.
It looks great.

135
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,548
Why don't you give me some extra ones,
and I'll pass them out for you.

136
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,055
Okay. I appreciate this.

137
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,590
Okay, Jessica.

138
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,054
When elected, Marlon,
I won't let you down.

139
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,798
- Bye.
- Bye.

140
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,835
- Hi.
- Hi.

141
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,599
- So how was Italy, Jessica?
- Oh, it was great. It changed my life.

142
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,800
Well, being an exchange student
looks super on your record.

143
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,141
You'd be surprised how important
it is the way you spend your summers.

144
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,476
It's getting insane.
Okay, let's see.

145
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,882
Last spring your first choice
was Michigan.

146
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,888
- My parents are alums. That's where they met.
- Michigan's an excellent school.

147
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,788
- So what's the problem?
- I want to go to Ramsey College.

148
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,225
[Gasps]
Ooh, goody! Ramsey.

149
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,391
[Jessica] I met a group of kids
in Italy who go to Ramsey.

150
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,400
They were on this
junior-year abroad program...

151
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,595
in Venice to save the Italian frescoes
from pollution.

152
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:35,140
While I was there, I realized
it's exactly the sort of thing I want to do.

153
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,402
I mean, instead of being
a sorority girl...

154
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,844
which is basically the direction
I've been headed in ever since... birth.

155
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,242
Those kids are so cool.

156
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,615
When they order spaghetti,
they call it pasta.

157
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,280
I think you have a wonderful
chance to get into Ramsey.

158
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,653
So apply there
and apply to Michigan.

159
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,420
Right.

160
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,497
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you. Good luck.

161
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,657
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

162
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,437
Do you have
an appointment, Marlon?

163
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,532
Or did you just drop in?
Here. Come here.

164
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,611
Bye-bye.

165
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,748
So, Marlon, uh,
any specific college plan?

166
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,654
- Well, you know Jessica Kailo.
- This Jessica Kailo?

167
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,784
Mm-hmm. This Jessica Kailo.

168
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,794
The same one that just left?

169
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,865
Mm-hmm. My college plan
specifically...

170
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,957
is to go wherever
she might be going.

171
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,901
- That's your college plan?
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,339
That's about the size of it.

173
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,035
That's about the size of it.

174
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:47,238
[Man] Our projections indicate that
we can expect over 8,000 applications...

175
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,543
- for the 470 places in next year's class.
- [Man] Wow.

176
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,915
In other words, that's almost
20 candidates for each available spot.

177
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,046
Thanks, Sally. In other words,
it's a seller's market.

178
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,852
- [Man] Hear, hear.
- Now, as usual...

179
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,018
we are top-heavy
with students from both coasts.

180
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,892
So for those of you
recruiting out west, eyes out...

181
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,261
for that mythical kid
from Montana.

182
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,926
[Woman Giggling]

183
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,199
- Yes, Miss Saatchi, something funny?
- No. No, sir. I'm sorry.

184
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:17,071
Oh, yes. And yesterday I received
this message from the music department.

185
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,872
"Jesus, Bob, no more oboes."

186
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,608
"No more oboes."Lock up their pencils.
That's one funny bunch.

187
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,446
By the way, did everyone see
the poster Kip designed?

188
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,918
Oh, yeah.
Hammett, the floor is yours.

189
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,184
Okay, well, you know,
it's just our regular brochure...

190
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:36,421
but unfolded,
it's an art-quality poster.

191
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,123
Sally, can you help me?

192
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:43,065
See. "At Ramsey, we're looking
beyond the numbers."

193
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,764
[Coughs] But what does
it mean exactly?

194
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,399
What it means, Flutter, is that, sure,
grades and S.A.T.'s are important to us...

195
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,409
but people impress us more.

196
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,376
We're sending a message.

197
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,972
- Want to know the message
this poster is sending, Kip?
- No.

198
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:03,249
[Scoffs] Bob, it sounds to me
like Ramsey has an inferiority complex.

199
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:07,291
Come on. What's the problem?
Ramsey always gets great kids. I went here.

200
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,554
Exactly.

201
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,825
I think our message should be that
we're scrutinizing the numbers.

202
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:17,665
So do I. We should be competitive
with all the top schools.

203
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,068
Chancellor Holbrooke,
come in, please.

204
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,504
Sit down, everyone.

205
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,776
Is that a new suit?
It's your color, Mrs. Holbrooke.

206
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,506
Thank you, Leo.

207
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:33,074
[Bob] I think all of you know I'll be
moving on to another school next year.

208
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,982
Chancellor Holbrooke will be
naming my replacement.

209
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,749
I thought I would ask her
to say a few words.

210
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,657
And those few words are I am looking
to promote from within.

211
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,458
I also want to thank Bob for
the fine work he's done the last 17 years.

212
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:49,398
The quality of our applicant pool
just gets better and better.

213
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,938
Leo says this year's kids
should be off the charts.

214
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,529
Thank you, Chancellor.
Joanna.

215
00:12:55,641 --> 00:13:01,204
This year we are going to
get killer kids...

216
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:04,771
the kind of student that can
make it in the real world...

217
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,409
the kind that can land
those high-paying jobs...

218
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,353
and drive those big cars.

219
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,552
- Like that B.M.W. You lease?
- I think my car sends a very strong message.

220
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,289
And if I had designed
this poster, it might read... Sally...

221
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:24,336
"Come to Ramsey, and one day
you too will own a B.M.W." Thank you, Sally.

222
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,963
Now, that's a sentiment
that won't be lost...

223
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,041
on today's
career-minded students.

224
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:34,704
What about kids that aren't sentimental
about cars? Do we just reject all of them?

225
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,146
Life's full
of rejection, Hammett.

226
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,945
I think we're doing
the low-caliber applicant a favor...

227
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,577
by letting them know that
right at the starting line.

228
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,252
It's very painful to be
rejected by a college, Marlon...

229
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,351
and you just don't have
the numbers to get into Ramsey.

230
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,760
But I can take my S.A.T.'s
over again, right?

231
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,834
And you should also
start trying to find some safeties...

232
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,837
like maybe a state school
up in the Upper Peninsula.

233
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,407
Jessica Kailo's applying there?

234
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,040
Get out of here, Marlon.

235
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,773
- Go. Leave. Be gone. Get out.
- Thank you, Miss Wyler.

236
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,850
"At Ramsey, we're looking
beyond the numbers."

237
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,442
I'm beginning to like
the sound of that, Kip.

238
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,181
Yeah, it'll help us root out
the pigs, Flutter.

239
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,190
Yeah, or any other barnyard animals
who are trying to apply.

240
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,159
[Flutter] If you'd read that folder,
you'd have fallen for it too.

241
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:27,198
Come on, Flutter. I mean,
the transcript read, "I am a pig."

242
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,826
Irving Michael Anthony Pigg,
spelled P-I with a double "G."

243
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,996
- It was a brilliant prank.
Would have fooled anyone.
- [Electronic Whirring]

244
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,700
[Leo Scoffs]
It only fooled you, Flutter.

245
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,607
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

246
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,012
Okay. What is this?

247
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:47,279
All right. A year ago I was tricked into
admitting a pig. I was made a fool of.

248
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,616
Can't you let me
forget it, Leo?

249
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,920
Come on. I mean, always hiding
these pigs in my office...

250
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,789
Please.
[Groans]

251
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,624
[Toy Squeaking]

252
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,494
[Squeaking Continues]

253
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,659
[Kip] It takes a special breed of
admissions officer to admit an animal.

254
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,728
- Even one with all the numbers.
- The numbers are great. I've got 'em in my office.

255
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,774
Hey, guys.
Coach Evans is looking for you.

256
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:10,910
[All]
Coach Evans. Break!

257
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,774
[All]
Coach Evans. Break!

258
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,311
- [Whistle Blows]
- Hold it right there, you people.

259
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,974
It makes me nervous when you boys
disappear behind closed doors.

260
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,382
I end up with athletic chemists
and well-rounded political science majors...

261
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,320
instead of somebody
who can run with a football.

262
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,618
[Groans]
Hand off to you, Kip.

263
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,989
- I've got a lunch with the chancellor.
- [Groans]

264
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,255
Nice move.

265
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,958
But you and I, we're gonna talk about it now,
goddamn it! Goddamn it!

266
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,230
Nina! Coach, come on.
I give. Uncle. Uncle.

267
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,602
Now, just in case you've forgotten
what they look like, this is an athlete.

268
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:46,041
- Ronny "Sure Hands"Paulson?
- He's already the center of an all-out bidding war.

269
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,114
Maybe we could just
mention a car this year... a small car.

270
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,206
I mean, some schools are offering
stock portfolios, goddamn it.

271
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:56,118
You'd better coordinate with Nina. She's
our man in charge of minority recruitment.

272
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,382
This is not minority recruitment.
This is athletics.

273
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,856
Look, this kid
can get in anywhere.

274
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,985
I want someone
who needs Ramsey.

275
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:07,191
Well, me too. But if he can
catch a goddamn football.

276
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,132
[Chuckles]
See you, Coach.

277
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:18,300
Why don't you just come with us to the college
fair and at least talk to the Ramsey people?

278
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,378
- Oh, I should talk to the Ramsey people?
- Yeah.

279
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,744
There are just about eight zillion kids
dying to get into Michigan.

280
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:28,081
Your sisters went to Michigan.
They loved Michigan. They survived.

281
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,089
Yeah, they all survived
ham pineapple surprise too, Dad.

282
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,716
What's wrong with
ham pineapple surprise?

283
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,228
Your sisters all
asked for the recipe.

284
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,390
Dad, you know
I'm not like my sisters...

285
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,593
and I'm ready to start
making my own decisions...

286
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,897
with what I want to do
with my life, right?

287
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,202
She wants to save
Italian frescoes.

288
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,038
Oh, la santa Jessica.
How sweet.

289
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,409
Did you ever think there might be something
else around here that needed saving?

290
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,175
Did you ever go to
downtown Detroit?

291
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,217
The whole place has to be
scraped and sprayed. It's polluted.

292
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,787
- Come on, Dad. Be serious.
- I am serious, honey.

293
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:06,153
Why should we pay $10,000
for you to go to Ramsey...

294
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,283
when you can
go to Michigan for two?

295
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,624
Come on. Is the football team
five times cuter?

296
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,323
Do you get an education
that's five times better?

297
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,196
I'll get a job. I'm already
looking into student loans.

298
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,496
I really wish you'd decide
to come with.

299
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:25,036
There's been a big change with student loans,
you know. They want to get paid back.

300
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,202
Let's go.

301
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,214
- Mom?
- What?

302
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,410
- Is Dad really my father?
- Honey.

303
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,488
Rah, rah, Ramsey.

304
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,816
Okay, let's meet
those Ramsey people. Come on.

305
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,018
Dad, are you really
gonna wear that hat?

306
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,027
No, your mother's gonna
wear the hat.

307
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,963
- Oh, George, we're so glad
you're keeping an open mind.
- Open wallet's more like it.

308
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:54,337
College fair. College fair. You know, Jack
Kerouac never went to a college fair, Marlon.

309
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,967
Oh, yeah? Well, he would have if he
knew Jessica Kailo was gonna be there.

310
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:03,674
A great afternoon wasted on a boring,
uneventful and predictable formality.

311
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,943
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

312
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,315
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

313
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,081
[Marching]

314
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,022
Marlon, don't forget.
Safety first.

315
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,025
Get plenty of safeties.

316
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,862
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

317
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,599
Lone Star State.
Y'all come in and check us out.

318
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,362
- [All] Yeehaw!
- [Both Scream]

319
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,797
Hi, boys.
What are your names?

320
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:30,772
- Oliver.
- Marlon.

321
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,604
Excuse me?

322
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,608
- Oliver.
- Marlon.

323
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,678
- What'd you say?
- Marlon.
- Oliver.

324
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,939
I can't hear you, boy!

325
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,139
- Oliver!
- Marlon!

326
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,772
You girls want to
go to college?

327
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:38,645
- No.
- Yeah.

328
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,184
College is for pussies!

329
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,618
- Hold it. Stop right there, students.
- [Both Scream]

330
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,282
Do you believe in robotics
and artificial intelligence?

331
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,827
- [Students] Yeah.!
- Then come along and follow me.

332
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,862
Regard, Marlon,
the nerd factor...

333
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,098
followed by
the Asian factor.

334
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,692
All of us expected to play our roles according
to future needs of a planned economy.

335
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,704
Hey, at least
we have a future.

336
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,037
From what I hear,
Marlon could end up flipping hamburgers.

337
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:08,011
How did he know? What, are my grades
posted on a bulletin board somewhere?

338
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,740
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

339
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,282
I'm glad you're interested
in us, Jessica...

340
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,551
'cause Ramsey's a campus
full of real individuals.

341
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,093
- That's great.
- Those are the people...

342
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,187
you want to spend four years
of your life with?

343
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,391
Maybe I should just go
over there alone.

344
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,094
- Let me give you my card.
- Good luck.

345
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,735
Please, give us a call, any of you,
if you have any questions.

346
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,608
- Oh, thank you.
- I have a question, young man.

347
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,806
[Clears Throat]
Is the pizza at Ramsey...

348
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,111
- five times better than the pizza at Michigan?
- Daddy.

349
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,676
I hope you'll answer that by coming
to our open house, Mr. Kailo.

350
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,086
- Some of us will be there.
- We'll be there. Definitely.

351
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,786
- Oh, yeah. Count on us.
- Thanks.

352
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,624
Hi. Could I answer
any questions about Ramsey?

353
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,791
Uh, no. No. This is the school
I wanted right here.

354
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,300
[Mouthing Word]

355
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:09,200
Welcome to
the Arcadia Bible Academy.

356
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:14,974
Last night, Jesus Christ appeared to me
in a vision on a flaming pie...

357
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,605
and he spoke unto me
and said, "I want..."

358
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,616
What's your name?

359
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,482
- Marlon.
- Marlon!

360
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:26,046
"I want Marlon to attend
the Arcadia Bible Academy...

361
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,456
payin' full tuition,
of course."

362
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,154
Son, Jesus loves you.

363
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,164
He might not if he saw
my S.A.T. Scores.

364
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,166
- They're low?
- Low.

365
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,270
All right.

366
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:43,137
- Thanks anyway.
- Yeah. Jesus.

367
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,878
[Sighs]

368
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,152
I've been working at Ramsey
for about a year. I really enjoy it...

369
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,193
Excuse me. Is it too late
to ask questions?

370
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,728
No, no, no.
It's never too late.

371
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,196
Choosing a college
is a major decision.

372
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,199
Given some thought
to your educational goals?

373
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:13,431
Well, personally speaking,
say, uh, I were in love with a girl...

374
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,665
but obviously she wouldn't be
interested in me...

375
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,868
until I had something more
to offer her and the world in general.

376
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,003
I know that Ramsey would be
a good place for me to go and do that.

377
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,447
- You want to go to college to broaden your mind.
- Right.

378
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,882
Because you want to
win this girl.

379
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,955
- Jessica Kailo.
- I talked toJessica Kailo.

380
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,990
So have I. Once.

381
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,423
"Once." You're following
a girl to college...

382
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,552
you've talked to once.
[Chuckles]

383
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,563
- Look, um...
- Marlon.

384
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:43,226
Marlon. Marlon, do you think this is
the best way to plan your future?

385
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,565
[Exhales]
Maybe not the best way...

386
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,435
but people choose colleges
for all kinds of idiotic reasons...

387
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,065
like fraternities and
Slavic language departments.

388
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,474
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but, uh, I gotta tell ya...

389
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,376
trailing after
a girl is risky.

390
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,109
Someone likeJessica Kailo,
l-l-I'm sure she has plans.

391
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,646
On the other hand,
you're right. I mean...

392
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,656
people have given me much worse reasons
for wanting to get into Ramsey.

393
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,851
No kidding. I bet.

394
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,360
Marlon, why don't you
just take my card.

395
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,660
You and your parents
come to our open house. All right?

396
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:18,031
Well, actually it's my dad
and my stepmother, and they're kind of busy.

397
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,798
That's okay.
You come, then.

398
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,999
- Really?
- Yeah.

399
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:26,600
Wow. I really appreciate this,
Mr. Hammett.

400
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,612
- You'll definitely be hearing from me.
- Okay.

401
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,182
- Oh!
- [Chuckles]

402
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,546
[Grunts]
Help.

403
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,091
[Woman] Okay, Willie,
find the tetrahedron.

404
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:44,128
- [Chuckles]
- No, that's a hexagon, sweetie.

405
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,459
See? Count.

406
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,090
[Together]
One, two, three...

407
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,762
four, five, six.

408
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,931
- Willie!
- Marlon.

409
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,101
Airplane. Airplane.
Airplane. Airplane.

410
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,616
All right. Give me your arm. Give me your leg.
[Imitates Engine Roaring]

411
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,743
- I hate when he does that.
- So, Marlon...

412
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,152
any progress on
the old college front?

413
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,781
Yep. I talked to a guy
about a school today.

414
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,554
- Which one? Harvard?
- [Chuckles]

415
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,129
- No, Sharon.
- Mom.

416
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:24,168
Call Sharon "Mom," Marlon.
Come on. Give it a try. Come on.

417
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,169
No, Mom, it wasn't
old Harvard...

418
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,205
or Stanford or even M.I.T.

419
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,866
- It's Ramsey.
- Ramsey.

420
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,944
- Where else did you look?
- Nowhere else.

421
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,638
- For God's sakes.
- I thought the idea was to make a list.

422
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,910
Of course it was.
A long, practical list.

423
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,315
How many hundreds of colleges
were at that fair?

424
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,753
How many thousands exist in this country
and you come up with a list of one?

425
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,256
- And I don't think he'll get into there.
- Of course he won't.

426
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,295
The thing about Ramsey, Dad, is that
they actually consider people like me.

427
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,364
What does that mean?
They're searching for someone...

428
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,933
with a definitive collection
of Silver Surfer comic books?

429
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,264
This is not helpful.
Come on. Get out.

430
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,175
I got this for you.

431
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,769
"Bauer & Benedek College
Preparation Service"?

432
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:14,215
Someone in Sharon's... your mom's...
aerobics class sent their kid there.

433
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,810
I don't know. Maybe they can
do something for you.

434
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,822
I want you to go, Marlon.

435
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:22,018
- It's time you got your head out of the clouds.
- You're right, Dad.

436
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,027
And it is. It's out.

437
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,496
I made a valuable contact today,
and I really think that you should trust me.

438
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,999
What does that mean, Bill?

439
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,698
He'll still be
living at home next year?

440
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,188

- Him?

Oh, Christ.

now that we're in the same boat, huh?

Would you guys stop worrying?
This is a practice test. I'm in a class.

454
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,184
Bail, punk, bail.

455
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:37,191
Does everyone agree it's questions
like this one that forced you in here?

456
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:41,238
- [All] Yeah.
- Welcome to the Bauer-Benedek workshop.
It's hard.

457
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,069
And let's face it, if you had
a snowball's chance in hell...

458
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:47,406
of solving this, you wouldn't have to
be here on a beautiful Saturday morning...

459
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,412
preparing to take
your S.A.T.'s over again.

460
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,675
- Am I right?
- [Sobbing]

461
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:55,776
Okay. But does that mean
you should leave the question blank?

462
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,787
- Yes.
- Never.

463
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:02,258
- Right, Francine.
- A blank answer gets you zero points.

464
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,022
Knowing that and applying
the law of averages...

465
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,588
tells you that if you can eliminate two
choices out of a five-answer question...

466
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,498
or just one choice from
a question that has only four...

467
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:16,165
then you're better off guessing than leaving
the question blank, which gives you zero points.

468
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,970
- Are you with me so far?
- [All] No.

469
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,012
Well, that's the beauty
of the Bauer-Benedek system.

470
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:27,016
You see, you don't have to
understand us. Just...

471
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:29,177
- trust us.
- Trust us.

472
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,619
Guessing cannot hurt you.

473
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,626
You have the B&B
guarantee on that.

474
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,923
Just close your eyes and point.

475
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,792
[Sobbing]

476
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,630
Keep bailing.
We're gonna be all right.

477
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:48,194
Oh, really?
The moron's back.

478
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,503
- Look, you guys, it's okay to guess.
- Skip it.

479
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,170
So, uh, let's say
the answer is, um...

480
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,510
- Let's just make it "D."
- "D"? What are you thinking about? "D"?

481
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,813
- No, uh, "B." "B."
- You're gonna kill us! Leave it blank!

482
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,479
- Leave it blank. Go back to it.
- You freak!

483
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,886
- "B."
- Go by it. Next question.

484
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,288
It's "A." "E."

485
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,326
- Save us!
- "A."

486
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,997
- Thank you.
- [Sobbing]

487
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,437
Marlon, how did it go?

488
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,238
Okay. I'm not too sure about
the guessing part though.

489
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,803
You're like every kid who walks
in here, Marlon... gullible.

490
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,815
The process has you intimidated.

491
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:37,149
You think getting into the college of your
choice has to do with how smart you are.

492
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,155
You know what it actually is?

493
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,248
It's imaging.
It's P.R. And strategy...

494
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,884
selling yourself
and marketing...

495
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,860
positioning and packaging.

496
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:49,832
Wow! It sounds like I could skip college
and go straight to product endorsement.

497
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,837
Look...

498
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,167
can you guys help me
get into Ramsey College?

499
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,935
How about sports? If you're good,
it's always gonna help you.

500
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,012
Football? Baseball?
Soccer? Swimming?

501
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,171
Lacrosse, wrestling, polo?

502
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,545
Discus, tennis, volleyball,
javelin, something?

503
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,710
One year I won the Neighborhood
Association Ping-Pong Championship.

504
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,519
- Ping-Pong.
- Do you have your check, Marlon?

505
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,525
Yeah.

506
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,922
- Thank you, Marlon.
- Thanks.

507
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:25,332
[Man Rapping]

508
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:32,299
[Man] See, Ron is just
a tremendous athlete...

509
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,311
and he's talking
to them big schools...

510
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,075
and what they're saying
to him is money...

511
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,208
apartments, cars.

512
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:43,446
You know, some schools have even
offered to bring me up on holidays...

513
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,855
off-season... maybe even bring
my Ronny home on weekends.

514
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,621
- Wha...
- See, he's overwhelmed. He wants
to make the right decision...

515
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,697
but he's only human...

516
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,425
and you and I both know
he will generate a shitload...

517
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,934
Excuse my French.
Uh, uh...

518
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:02,302
He'll generate a shitload of money
for whatever school he goes to.

519
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,341
Ronny, do you want to
go to a college...

520
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:07,309
You know, some schools have
even mentioned stock portfolios.

521
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,279
Yeah, I've heard of those schools
who offer things to athletes.

522
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:13,475
Not to just athletes,
Miss Saatchi.

523
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,450
- [Chuckles]
- [Chuckles]

524
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,113
I think I know
what you mean.

525
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:22,751
- Well, congratulations on your all-state, Ronny.
- Oh, thank you.

526
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:26,922
Uh, now we might as well say good-bye,
because other than a scholarship...

527
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,158
I can't really
offer you anything...

528
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,201
or your coach.

529
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,770
The truth is...

530
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,500
our team isn't
really that great anyway.

531
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,305
I'm sure you have other people for Ronny to meet
and talk about your retirement plan.

532
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,936
If you want to talk education,
Ronny, give me a call.

533
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,845
- Can we at least get your phone number?
- Let me get some paper.

534
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,383
I've got a card right...

535
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,680
May I have
this piece of paper, please?

536
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,084
- What's your number?
- I know that didn't just happen.

537
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,388
Excuse me. Actually...

538
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,192
there were words on that piece of paper
that I was reading...

539
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,199
you old fool!

540
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,201
[Chuckles]

541
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,635
I'll, uh, give you a call.

542
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,141
You know, I've been watching
Sure Hands be recruited...

543
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,647
but I have never seen
technique like that before.

544
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,583
- [Hip-Hop]
- Morris!

545
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,654
Would you chill out
with the noise, please?

546
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,485
[Stops]

547
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,991
Thank you.

548
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,152
That girl studying,
what grade is she in?

549
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,662
Oh, Vera Cooke?
She's a senior.

550
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:38,225
Hmm. What kind of college plans
would she have, do you think?

551
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,668
Community college maybe.
I don't know.

552
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,672
Why don't you ask her?

553
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,401
Good idea.

554
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,680
- Excuse me. Vera?
- Yes.

555
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:55,150
Um, uh, my name is Nina Saatchi.
Do you have a minute?

556
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,086
- Sure.
- I'm a recruiter from Ramsey College.

557
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,157
I don't know if you've
heard of it.

558
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,455
[Laughs] I've heard of it enough to know
you're not giving away cars.

559
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:06,462
I'm sorry if we disturbed you,
but did you happen to hear...

560
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,691
anything else
that made an impression?

561
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,530
Well, the part about
a serious education sounded nice...

562
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,536
and being off in oasis...

563
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,937
but I'm sure that stuff only applies
for people like Ronny Paulson.

564
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,168
No, no, that's not
necessarily true.

565
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,212
In fact, I'd love to tell you more
about it if you're interested.

566
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:25,282
Sounds great, but the problem is
I'm getting ready to go to work.

567
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,544
Oh, well, could we
talk about it at work?

568
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,246
- Sure, if you want to.
- So what do you do?

569
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,950
Well, I'm somewhat
of a spud technician.

570
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:42,299
And that is why I was so excited
about finding Vera in the library today.

571
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,300
I could tell that
she's passionate.

572
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,269
- I'm just a little enthusiastic.
- You are.

573
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:51,138
I never want to tell my kids
they can't do something...

574
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,972
Lindy, don't ride
that thing like that.

575
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,512
Because that's not good.

576
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,981
It just deflates
their aspirations, but Vera...

577
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,679
Watch out, Mom. You're just
about to deflate my aspirations.

578
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:07,224
I'm sorry, Vera, but I can't
sit here and listen to somebody...

579
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,589
tempt you with offers
she can't deliver.

580
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:13,027
I can promise a fair shake
from the admissions committee.

581
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,861
I'm looking for more
than a fair shake for Vera.

582
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,128
I'm looking for her
to have a real career.

583
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,760
- Mom.
- First, get thejob.

584
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,032
Then go to college
at night if you want to.

585
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,700
That's the way to do it.

586
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,377
Cookies.

587
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,004
My mother is a bit stubborn,
but I'll keep talking to her.

588
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,208
And I'll call her
and talk to her some more.

589
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,617
Meanwhile, I want you to see Ramsey.
You've got to come to our open house.

590
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:40,817
How about if I tell her I'm attending
a McD.L.T. Training seminar?

591
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:43,189
- [Laughs] See you later.
- See you later.

592
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,194
Can I help you, please?

593
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,560
[Instrumental Film Theme]

594
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,964
[Continues]

595
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,005
Oh, I love this part.

596
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,409
So, how was your day?

597
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,672
The best. I found someone
unbelievable...

598
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:05,647
just sitting in the library thinking swing shift
keypunch was the best life has to offer.

599
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,311
Yeah. This doesn't sound like
Ronny "Sure Hands"Paulson.

600
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,413
- She is somebody nobody wants.
- Great. How are her numbers?

601
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,326
Ouch.

602
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,919
I can't believe
you asked that.

603
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,037
They don't sound so good.

604
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,238
She's bright,
articulate, feisty.

605
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,607
She needs a full scholarship.

606
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,182
Maybe she does.

607
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:46,513
[Marlon] "Two men, 'A'and 'B, 'jump

610
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,963
In order to land
at the same time as 'A'?"

611
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,125
- Uh, I think it's "B."
- [Screaming Continues]

612
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,533
- "C."
- You're killing me!

613
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,298
- "A."
- Ow!

614
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,533
- "A." "A."
- Answer the question!

615
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,973
- "E"!
- Answer the question, Marlon!

616
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,375
I don't know.

617
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,140
I don't know.
I don't know.

618
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,580
[Screaming Continues]

619
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:18,077
I'm still not convinced
about the guessing part.

620
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,749
Yeah, well, that was my last chance
for that stupid test.

621
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,826
If that Bauer-Benedek stuff
doesn't work...

622
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,760
- I might end up at
the East Michigan School of Beauty.
- Hi, guys.

623
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,730
- Hey, did you know that Marlon's
applying to Ramsey too?
- Oh.

624
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:32,234
Well, it's on my list of schools,
but I'm considering a very long list.

625
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:35,635
Not me. My mom's driving me to Ramsey's
open house next week for my interview.

626
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,733
We just went to the Bauer & Benedek school
on interviewing and it better work.

627
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,506
I know. They said you're supposed to be
confident but not arrogant.

628
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,673
- Yeah, frank but don't lie.
- Spontaneous but never combust.

629
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,683
So are you going
for an interview, then?

630
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,811
Sure. In fact, the interview's gonna be
key for me since I'm the type...

631
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,083
that comes across much better
in person than on paper.

632
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,024
Oh, you do?
Maybe I'll see you there.

633
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,789
Right. I'll look for you.

634
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,796
- Okay.
- Bye.

635
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,493
All right, girls. Reality check here. Does
Marlon Browne stand a chance at Ramsey?

636
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,070
- Are you kidding? Marlon Browne?
- Marlon Browne?

637
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:11,301
Well, that's what I thought. I don't know
though. He's kind of cute in a weird way.

638
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,478
I think you think that because he's your
competition. Since he's really no competition...

639
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,639
I think you think that because he's your
competition. Since he's really no competition...

640
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,010
I think you're feeling grateful
but confused.

641
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,279
You know, by an exaggerated
sense of euphoria.

642
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,285
You know, Kelly,
you're right. Thanks.

643
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:27,289
- Getting into college
can really play with your mind.
- Yeah.

644
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,954
I can't believe this.
I feel like such a hypocrite.

645
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,966
I'm actually driving you
to college...

646
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:40,231
so you can become another industrial
bureaucrat polluting our environment.

647
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,869
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I could really take a few lessons...

648
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,170
from you in that department, huh, Oliver?
[Coughing]

649
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,303
- What are you being, sarcastic?
- [Exhaust Backfiring]

650
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,678
[Jessica]
Mom, isn't this place beautiful?

651
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,081
- I mean, everybody looks so smart.
- I know.

652
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,086
- It's great.
- It is. It's beautiful.

653
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:00,555
God, Mother, I love this place. This is
the only school I ever want to go to.

654
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,592
Oh. It's very impressive.

655
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:06,094
- Oh, look. It's Mr. Hammett.
Come on. Let's go talk to him.
- Oh, yeah.

656
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,392
- Hi, Mr. Hammett.
- Hi, Julie.

657
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,399
- Jessica.
- Jessica. Right.

658
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,492
- Jessica Kailo.
- You remembered my name.

659
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,436
- I see you brought your sister along.
- Oh.

660
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,939
Hi, Kip.

661
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,906
- Hi.
- We were gonna go on a tour of the campus.

662
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,571
- I hope you like the college,
and I'll see you at the party.
- Okay, great.

663
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,204
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

664
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,682
- Such a nice young man.
- Mother. Favor. Please don't ask any questions.

665
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,049
I want everything
under control. Okay?

666
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,122
Oh, Jessica.
Come on.

667
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,851
Jessica is really
starting to like me.

668
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,725
It's still subtle, but she's starting to think
of me as a college guy, you know...

669
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,763
and that intrigues her.

670
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,824
- Things are really gonna jell
once she sees me on that campus.
- [Raspberries]

671
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,904
You think I'm crazy.

672
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,804
No, I think you're a lunatic,
but that's why we're friends.

673
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:53,638
Now make love to me,
you hot college monkey, you!

674
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:56,542
[Man Singing]

675
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,411
[Ends]

676
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:03,283
It is really going to be difficult
making decisions this year.

677
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,117
Your "looking beyond the numbers"
campaign is really pulling them in.

678
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,124
[Chuckles]

679
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,127
I still say they should tattoo
their S.A.T. Scores across their forehead.

680
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,629
At least that way I could make
my decisions easy enough.

681
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,067
My dear God.

682
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:22,434
- Hi, I'm...
- Leo Whitman. [Chuckles]

683
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,236
We met at the Carlsborough Academy
alumni tea, Dr...

684
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,573
- Dr. PhillipJellinek.
- Jellinek. That's right.

685
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:30,272
- PhillipJellinek, Jr.
- Yes, you are, and welcome to Ramsey.

686
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,611
It's incredible.

687
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,083
The girls' dorm is this way,
and over that way...

688
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:39,885
And you still think it will be the same around
here with Leo as the dean of admissions.

689
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,425
[Scoffs]
I don't want to be dean of admissions.

690
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,290
All right. But what's it
going to be like working for him?

691
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,956
- [Horn Honking]
- [Whistle Blows]

692
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,760
Oh, wow. Wow.
Look who's here.

693
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,665
We got Ronny "Sure Hands" Paulson
here, goddamn it.

694
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,103
- Hi, Ronny.
- Hello, Miss Saatchi. I'll bet
you're surprised to see us.

695
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:00,041
I'll admit, a little.
Dean, this is Ronny Paulson.

696
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,339
And this is Ronny's lawyer,
Dan Bestman.

697
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,779
- We were supposed to bring a lawyer?
- [All] Shit.

698
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,783
[Man Singing]

699
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:17,660
So how have you found Ramsey so far?

700
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,287
- I took the bus, remember?
- [Chuckles]

701
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,298
No. Really,
Miss Saatchi, I'm fine.

702
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,368
I appreciate
your time and concern...

703
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,868
but you should be out
enjoying yourself.

704
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,872
It's not exactly me
you should be baby-sitting.

705
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:35,874
Oh, you're right. I have to go
baby-sit the love of my life. Excuse me.

706
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,141
I'm sure I'll be just fine.

707
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:42,079
- [Together] Hi.
- I was wrong.

708
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,086
What is this atrocity?

709
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,986
[Kip]
Welcome, Ramsey hopefuls.

710
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,021
- We're theJellineks.
- Oh, yes. You certainly are.

711
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,758
So, are you just dropping off
young Jellinek?

712
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,857
- Why would I do that?
- See, sir, it's, uh...

713
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,936
it's kind of
a kids' get-together.

714
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,972
They can kind of unwind
without the parents around...

715
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,542
and get a feel
for the social life here at Ramsey.

716
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,543
- Social life?
- Yeah.

717
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:10,842
- Social disease is more like it.
- Why don't you look around, have some food...

718
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,882
and spread your warmth.

719
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,883
Making, uh,
new friends here?

720
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,954
See the world, Vera.
Smash out of this coffin...

721
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,387
they call a college experience
before they shut the lid.

722
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:24,860
How very uplifting, Oliver. Ever thought about
entertaining sick kids in hospitals?

723
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,863
Oliver takes his college-free future
very seriously.

724
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:31,128
He's looking to travel the world
with renegade game show hostesses.

725
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:35,228
Sounds like your run-of-the-mill American
dream. What are you looking for, Marlon?

726
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,313
It just walked in.

727
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,719
[Singing Continues]

728
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:54,447
Hey, Marlon Browne.
You made it.

729
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,958
Barely. We took Oliver's car.

730
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,995
Ramsey's wonderful.

731
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,894
I just have this feeling that I'm
gonna ace my interview tomorrow.

732
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,559
- It's the only school I want to go to.
- Funny thing.

733
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,966
L-I suddenly think Ramsey
might be in my stars also.

734
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,006
Marlon, it's
the real world now.

735
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,267
Marlon, you're different.

736
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:17,142
Y-You mean, like different
different, or like Elephant Man different?

737
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,910
No, no, I mean good different.
You're not geeky.

738
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,043
- I mean you're not the way
I thought you were at school.
- Yeah, well...

739
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,054
this is a preview
of the college me.

740
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,125
- There's four more years of this
to come if you're interested.
- [Chuckles]

741
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,988
Just make a decision, Jess. I mean, they're not
gonna accept you or not accept you...

742
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,532
- based on your shoes.
- You need to stand out, Mom.

743
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:40,434
Every detail counts. Which do you think
I should wear, Reeboks or my loafers?

744
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,438
Your Reeboks.

745
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,634
Okay, but that could make me look
too frivolous and not intellectual enough.

746
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:50,180
- Why don't you wear your Reeboks
and show them your loafers?
- Mom.

747
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:54,012
Oh, honey. Wear your Reeboks.
Go for it. What the hell.

748
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,451
Good luck.
We're very proud of you.

749
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,461
[Leo] I'm sorry. I have no idea.
I'll find out why this happened.

750
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,559
I promise you, sir,
heads will roll. Trust me.

751
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,299
L-I can't believe someone would be
so insensitive as to make this mistake.

752
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,638
Sally, there's been a grievous mistake.
This is Mr. Jellinek.

753
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:23,406
Dr. Jellinek.
I'm PhillipJellinek, Jr.

754
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:26,074
- Sally, for some ungodly reason,
- My pleasure.

755
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:29,016
Phillip here has been scheduled
to interview with Flutter.

756
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,488
- Yeah? So what?
- It really doesn't matter
who conducts the interviews.

757
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,684
If it doesn't matter,
we'll see Dean Patterson.

758
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,761
No. His schedule
is already overloaded.

759
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,921
Overload...

760
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,522
Oh, Sally.
Can I have a word with you?

761
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,398
Well, if there's anything
I can help you with, uh...

762
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,529
questions about the courses...

763
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,197
accom... modations?

764
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,537
- Anything at all.
- Sally...

765
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,838
they met with the dean
at Princeton and Yale...

766
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:58,574
not some 4-H club reject
like Flutter.

767
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,207
Flutter is the guy
who only sees the people...

768
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:04,776
who are like...
bleeding-heart fresco savers.

769
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,823
You know,
socially-correct cheerleaders...

770
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:10,485
that are elected class president in spite of
the fact that they can't even decide...

771
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:13,563
which shoes to wear when they
leave the house without talking to Mommy.

772
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:18,465
TheJellineks are Ramsey legacy, for God sakes,
and you've got 'em scheduled with Flutter.

773
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,129
Leo, calm down.
I will see what I can do.

774
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,138
Good.

775
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,767
- All set, sir. Nothing to worry about.
- Good. We'll see the dean.

776
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,607
I didn't travel 400 miles
to see underlings.

777
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:33,205
Let the rest of these people
be seen by underlings...

778
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,615
- like that girl in the Reeboks there.
- [Leo] Her?

779
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,621
[Chuckles] Girls like her
are a dime a dozen.

780
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:43,124
She's state college material
at best.

781
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,486
Let's go inside.

782
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,328
"Dime a dozen"?

783
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:09,284
- Hi.
- Hi.

784
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:13,152
See her? I bet she has
a 3.5 grade average.

785
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,590
- Yeah? How do you know?
- Oh, almost everybody here does...

786
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:20,596
- with about a combined 1350 on their S.A.T.'s.
- Oh, me too.

787
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:25,294
- So, are there many people here
on the yearbook staff?
- Oh, billions.

788
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,700
- I'm editor of mine.
- Oh.

789
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:32,174
I'm just activity reporter of mine. I didn't
want it to interfere with my cheerleading.

790
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,144
Well, my cheerleading practice
comes before school.

791
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:40,512
Well, that wouldn't work for me because I have
class meetings in the morning and I'm president.

792
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,178
- Although you're probably class president also.
- No, vice president.

793
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:48,054
- That's an important job. I mean,
in case the president dies.
- My sister is president.

794
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,353
- Laurie.
- Terrie.

795
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,861
- We better go practice.
- We have a special audition...

796
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,897
With the music
department.

797
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,092
Great. What instrument
do you play?

798
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,101
- The violin.
- The oboe.

799
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:02,695
- She plays the oboe.
- She plays the violin. Anyway, we better get going.

800
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,570
- [Together] Good luck.
- Bye.

801
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:15,185
Excuse me.

802
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,450
[Sighs]

803
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,808
[Sally]
Jessica Kailo.

804
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,672
[Whimpers]

805
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:50,014
- [Buzzer Buzzes]
- Jessica Kailo's coming in, Mr. Flutter.

806
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,782
Oh, send her in, Sally.

807
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,685
- [Knocking On Door]
- Uh, come in.

808
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,458
Come in.
[Groans]

809
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:06,070
Oh, excuse me.
I'm Jessica Kailo, Mr. Flutter.

810
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,731
Oh, excuse me.
I'm Jessica Kailo, Mr. Flutter.

811
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,738
Oh, Jessica,
how are you?

812
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,274
I'm... I'm fine. Thanks.
And you?

813
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,140
Well, I've hurt my hand,
but I'm fine.

814
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:17,543
- Would you like to sit down, Julie.
- Jessica.

815
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,707
- Jessica. Yeah, fine.

[Squeaking Continues]

817
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,654
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Yes. Thank you.

818
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,788
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- [Cup Shatters]

819
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,989
Um, gotta go. See you.

820
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,496
Marlon Browne.
10:00 interview.

821
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,230
Terrific. Have a seat.

822
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,138
I was an exchange student
last summer.

823
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,404
So I learned quite a bit
of Italian.

824
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,648
Uh, y-yes.
And where were you?

825
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,844
- Where was I?
- Yes. Where did you study Italian?

826
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,986
- In Italy.
- Oh. Yes.

827
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,024
[Chuckles]

828
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:06,085
Uh, in Italy, I met a lot of
interesting people while I was studying there.

829
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,824
Some of them were involved
in saving the Italian frescoes.

830
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,991
Those are paintings.

831
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,365
Oh. Yes, of course.

832
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,132
- [Thinking] He's bored. I'm losing him.
- Go on. Go on.

833
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,674
I think one of
the most significant...

834
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,711
[Thinking] He's totally not interested.
He's... He's ignoring me.

835
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:25,043
He's cleaning his closets
while I'm dying a thousand deaths.

836
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,845
I'm completely blowing this.

837
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,942
All the old hand-carved animals.

838
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,021
Uh, horses, tigers...

839
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,386
ostriches, pigs...

840
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,686
Pigs? Why did you say that?

841
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:40,252
- I don't know why.
- Oh.

842
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:44,061
Well, you know,
pigs are very interesting animals.

843
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:47,160
One very famous literary figure
kept pigs as pets.

844
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:50,570
- Do you know who that was?
- [Thinking] Stress question, stress question.

845
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,074
- No.
- He was Gertrude Stein.

846
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,907
- Oh.
- [Toy Squeaking]

847
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,815
Uh... [Clears Throat]
I was also involved...

848
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,684
in a lot of other activities
at school...

849
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,313
- [Toy Squeaking]
- Yearbook staff...

850
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:10,222
uh, World Affairs Council...

851
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,160
um, Honor Society.

852
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,254
What's this?

853
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:18,027
Oh, uh, that's my watch.

854
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:22,663
Well, I see our time
is just about up, Julie.

855
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,139
- Jessica.
- Jessica.

856
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,142
- Okay, great.
- [Toy Squeaks]

857
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:30,213
- So my interview's over with.
- Unless there's something else...

858
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,214
you would like to reveal
about yourself.

859
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:35,012
Unless I have anything else
I'd like to reveal about myself?

860
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:39,054
Yes. Unless you have anything else
you'd like to reveal about yourself.

861
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:42,523
[Thinking] Reveal about myself?
Reveal about myself?

862
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,685
Reveal myself.
Reveal myself.

863
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,690
Anything else I'd like to
reveal about myself?

864
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,065
Is there anything else
I'd like to reveal about myself?

865
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,771
[Screams]

866
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,675
- Shit!
- Whoa!

867
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,041
I'll never
get accepted here.

868
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,080
[Sobbing]

869
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,550
Jessica?

870
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,883
Marlon, your appointment.

871
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:13,889
There's no rescheduling, pup.

872
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,050
Pup, pup, pup. Puppy.

873
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,060
Jessica, how you doin'?

874
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:22,689
Marlon, if you don't mind, I really
don't feel like talking right now.

875
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:25,859
Oh, sure. No problem. We can always
talk later in school or something.

876
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,938
- Or maybe next year here at Ramsey.
- I won't be here next year.

877
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,973
I'm not right
for this school.

878
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,065
Come on. You?
You're perfect...

879
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:36,475
- for Ramsey.
- Everyone here is perfect. Haven't you noticed?

880
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,514
I blew it. I had
a terrible interview.

881
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,515
[Scoffs] Jesus.
Interviews don't matter.

882
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:43,142
I just blew mine completely,
coming out here. How about that?

883
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:47,189
- I thought you said the interview
was gonna be the key for you.
- Sure, they matter a little.

884
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:51,728
But it's not like high school, where if you make
a mistake you get branded as a moron for life.

885
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:54,490
- It's no big deal at a place like Ramsey.
- How do you know?

886
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,767
Trying things out
is what happens at college.

887
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:01,599
You get a great chance to start all over again,
just when most people need to.

888
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:05,334
It's like a federal protection
and relocation program for teenagers.

889
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,036
You don't know how bad it was.

890
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,670
Nothing could be that bad.

891
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,012
- It was awful. Trust me.
- But awful enough to ruin your chances?

892
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,176
You would have to
do something really idiotic...

893
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,777
like expose yourself
or something.

894
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,454
Marlon, leave me alone,
all right?

895
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,130
Something happened
with her interview...

896
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:32,326
and she has locked herself in her hotel room
and won't talk to anyone.

897
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:34,768
- I think something really terrible has happened.
- I'm sorry...

898
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,499
but there is no way
I could show you her files.

899
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,871
They're strictly
confidential.

900
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,276
I know, but now she's considering
not even applying to Ramsey.

901
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,814
[Sighs] This choosing a college
because of a girl...

902
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,816
maybe we should
discuss that idea.

903
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,818
- We did once before.
- Yeah? What'd I say?

904
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,253
- You said you'd heard a lot of worse reasons.
- Are you in love with Jessica?

905
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:58,589
Then screw it.
Love is a fuckin'noble emotion...

906
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:01,994
but Ramsey is not gonna admit you
based on your feelings for a girl.

907
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,727
- You've gotta forget her.
- Forget her?

908
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,770
Let me worry
aboutJessica Kailo.

909
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:10,738
You concentrate on
your own application, okay?

910
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,741
[Sighs]
Okay.

911
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,403
This is terrific, Mr. Hammett.
Just great.

912
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,037
- Thanks so much.
- Sure.

913
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,946
I really appreciate this.
God, this is just great.

914
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:23,042
[Kip] My vote can't
be bought there, Marlon.

915
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:25,451
Thanks. Okay.

916
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,455
- Thanks again.
- Ooh. Ouch.

917
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:30,558
Yeah.

918
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,356
- [Knocking On Door]
- Come in.

919
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:44,206
I heard you wanted to
talk to me, Mr. Hammett.

920
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,707
Oh, yeah. Hi, Jessica.
Come on in.

921
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,903
I wanted to talk to you
before you left.

922
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,912
Hi. Sit down.

923
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,914
- How are ya?
- Hi.

924
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:57,077
I heard you were kind of upset after
your interview with Mr. Flutter yesterday.

925
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,588
Mr. Hammett, I'd rather not
talk about that right now.

926
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,625
Look, l... I know
you feel vulnerable.

927
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,627
I mean, you just
open yourself up...

928
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:09,665
to a perfect stranger,
probably for the first time.

929
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,666
But, look,
it's just an interview...

930
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,931
and you were not being judged
on what you have or what you don't have.

931
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:18,337
I know. You think the littlest things
are a big deal...

932
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,603
but, believe me,
really they're not.

933
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,507
Okay. We've seen it all before.

934
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,945
And Mr. Flutter,
he felt that you were an extremely...

935
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,415
well-rounded young lady.

936
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,418
Oh, God!

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

939
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,299
- Uh-huh.
- Pomona, can you hold?
I have Duke on the other line.

940
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,960
Duke, can you hold?
I have Georgetown on the other line.

941
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:49,129
I know you're disappointed, Chancellor Smith.
His application was fabulous.

942
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:52,868
We're counselors, not his parents. What can
we do if he didn't choose your school?

943
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,968
Oxford? Please hold. I have
Seven Sisters Colleges on the other line.

944
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,946
Girls, I'll call you back.
I have a very important client.

945
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,313
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

946
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:04,285
- So, Marlon, welcome back.
- How'd you do on your S.A.T.'s?

947
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:09,518
- Uh, well, my score did not go up
the 20% you promised.
- Let's see.

948
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,957
- Well, you gained 10 in math and 10 on verbal.
- That's 20. What's the problem?

949
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:18,125
[Man] No, all kidding aside, Marlon,
you do need our help.

950
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:21,295
- Do you have a check?
- But I need some real help.

951
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:24,464
L... I have a chance
of getting into Ramsey.

952
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,543
Marlon, academics don't necessarily
have to be your strong point.

953
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:32,138
What you need is a hook... something for
the committee to remember you by... stand out.

954
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:35,184
- Stick to the basics. Inner-city tutoring.
- Helping old people.

955
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:37,845
- Environmental cleanup task force.
- Nuclear research.

956
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:41,185
I'm not currently involved
in anything quite as interesting as that.

957
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,919
For a thousand bucks, we can make
anyone's life sound interesting.

958
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,587
For instance, what do you do
on a typical Saturday morning?

959
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:49,927
Nothing. Really.
L-I baby-sit my stepbrother.

960
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:51,967
Ah! You say nothing...

961
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:56,061
but baby-sitting your stepbrother
is exactly the kind of mundane activity...

962
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,233
that you can enhance
into a business opportunity...

963
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:03,142
something that can really make you
stand out in the applicant pool.

00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:32,100
Okay, you've got work experience taken care of.
Now you want to juxtapose an unusual activity.

969
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,700
Something that would wake up
a tired admissions officer at 3:00 a. M...

970
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:36,802
like the kid who
rafted down the Amazon.

971
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:39,279
A girl took up professional wrestling,
and she got into Yale.

972
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,715
- No, Harvard.

So you want to take wrestling
as an extracurricular activity, huh?

979
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,315
- [Cackling]
- No. Actually, I've been thinking it over...

I will. I just gotta
finish up this application.

990

Well, don't forget
to lock up.

[Sighs] So, did Leo give
good meeting in there?

1003
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:40,762
We had lunch and a very serious discussion
about Vera Cooke, if you must know.

1004
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,799
In fact, we've penciled in another
meeting to discuss the matter further.

1005

I've got work to do, Kip.

1007

But keep in mind, you have as many
opportunities as Leo to become dean.

1008
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,737
The only difference is
you refuse to grow up.

1009
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:07,687
- Well, we got Marlon Browne.
- Yes.

1010

Y-You didn't apply to Ramsey?

- The deadline is tonight.
- What are you, a recruiter?

1014
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,928
Didn't a certain Mr. Hammett
talk to you...

1015
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,973
about being perfect
Ramsey material?

1016
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:27,133
I don't want to
talk about that, Marlon.

1017
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:30,610
- Mr. Hammett has a warped sense of humor.
- What are you talking about?

1018
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:32,647
He's a great guy.
It's a great school.

1019

Marlon...

1021
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:41,015
Ramsey's not the right school
for me, okay?

1022
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,024
- So where are you going, then?
- Michigan.

1023
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,026

1024
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,824
You like Michigan
better than Ramsey?

1025
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:51,890
Look, Marlon, you couldn't possibly
understand the decisions I've had to make.

1026
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:54,435
Maybe I couldn't, but I've made
some decisions too.

1027
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:57,973
- I've made some very passionate decisions.
- Like what?

1028
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,974
How about suiciding,
for instance?

1029
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:02,704
I didn't apply anywhere but Ramsey,
and I don't stand a chance.

1030
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,712
That's great, Marlon.
That's just crazy!

1031
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,873
You're the suicide,
and I'm the one that cracked.

What's that make us,

I'm sorry, Marlon.

1034
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,658
You know what I found out
when I went to Ramsey?

1035
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:24,127
I discovered that
I'm boring and predictable...

1036
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,202
that I'm totally average,
so I freaked.

1037
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:29,362
I freaked, Marlon.

1038
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,940
Then you're not average.

1039
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:35,909
People who are average, Jessica, they don't
mind being average. They don't freak.

1040

Come on, Jessica.
Don't cry.

1041
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,745
Please don't cry.

1042
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:45,048

because I have this lousy effect on you.

No.

Okay, look. I think
I have an idea.

1048

[Marlon] A car traveling with
two future Ramsey students...

1049
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:10,875
must travel from hometown "A"
to college town "B"by 6:00 p.m.

1050
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,915
If the distance
to travel is 450 miles...

1051
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,281
and they observe
the 55 mile per hour speed limit...

1052
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:20,049
how much time can they allow
to stop for gas and snacks?

1053
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:23,751
None... because
six times 55 is 330.

1054
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,795
We won't get to Ramsey
even if we don't stop.

1055
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,796
Then how fast
should we go?

1056
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:32,356
Well, let's make it easy.
Six times 60 is 360.

1057
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,527
Thirty minutes to spare
should be enough time.

1058
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:38,232
- So, we, uh...
- We go 60, Marlon.

1059
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:41,003

00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,958

- Sounds so creative.

1063
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,258
I had to do something, you know?
I spent all this...

1064
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:04,265
time and money
going to these consultants.

1065
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:08,167
The only helpful thing I got from them was you
have to get the attention of admissions.

1066
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,206
They want to know who you are.
So I made this video.

we have to go?

Well, let's not rule out
graduate school.

1130
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:01,095
- [Chuckles]
- Good night, Marlon.

1131
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:03,392
Good night.

1132
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,070
[Sighs]

1133
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,311
[Horn Honking]

1134
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,313
That's right,
boys and girls...

1135
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,940
get your college paraphernalia
while it's hot.

1136
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:25,020
It's okay, Mom.
Just describe the envelope to me.

1137
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:27,021
Well, is it fat or what?

1138
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:29,091
Just tell me, Mom.
Is it fat or skinny?

1139
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:31,386
Mom, just tell me.
Is the envelope big or small?

1140
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,394
Mom, God!
Just...

1141
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,589
I got accepted into Michigan.
So big deal, right?

1142
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:37,427
I wouldn't care at all,
except for Kelly.

1143
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:40,093
She was rejected by
six schools already.

1144
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:42,898
[Sobs]
Seven schools!

1145
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:48,301
That's why I recommend suiciding.
You can only get rejected once.

1146
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:52,279
This waiting around here for Ramsey's
killing me. I wish I could have Amy's cool.

1147
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:55,748
Just talk to me, goddamn it!
Is it fat or what?

1148
01:05:55,851 --> 01:05:59,116
Fat or skinny?
[Screams] I'll kill her!

1149
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:03,351
Here's an interesting case.
Vera Cooke.

1150
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,794
She is, as far as I know...

1151
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:09,763
the most underprivileged youngster
that we have this year.

1152
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:12,356
She's got, uh... Oh, thanks, Leo.
She's got decent grades.

1153
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,368
Her father
is out of the picture.

1154
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,405
No, her father's dead.
She wrote about him in her essay.

1155
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:20,031
Oh. Oh, yes.
Oh, and it says here...

1156
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,475
"Her energy and struggle to obtain
her dreams has produced an individual...

1157
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:25,069
"both tough and sweet.

1158
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:28,639
She's a woman and a girl
to reckon with and to love."

1159
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:33,017
[Scoffs] Geez! Who writes this crap?
Lionel Richie?

1160
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:36,091
- I wrote it.
- You know, I met him once.

1161
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:39,059
- He's a lovely man if you meet him in person.
- This is Vera Cooke.

1162
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,096
- We discussed her, remember?
- Oh, yeah.

1163
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:45,929
I recruited Vera, and I strongly
recommend her to this committee.

1164
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:49,004
- How are her college boards?
- Well, she's 410 verbal, 470 math.

1165
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:53,098
The point is that's not the kind of question
we need to be asking about a person like Vera.

1166
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:57,270
- What is the right question?
- Whether we, as a group,
are willing to take a chance.

1167
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,406
This is a case in which Ramsey
can make a difference, one that...

1168
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,245
could actually change
someone's life.

1169
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,046
We all agree
with Nina, right?

1170
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:08,351
During the break, I talked to Leo.
He brought up an interesting point.

1171
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,357
Whose interests
are we serving here?

1172
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:13,758
Ramsey is a very
competitive environment.

1173
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:17,026
We need minority students,
but at the expense of this girl?

1174
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:20,728
I don't see that we're really
that desperate to fill our quota.

1175
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:23,634
Forget the quota.
Forget she's black.

1176
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:26,139
Good. My vote can't be won
on the basis of color.

1177
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:29,370
So what does that leave us with
as far as Vera Cooke is concerned...

1178
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:32,936
- aside from the dismal numbers?
- Everything that's not a number.

1179
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:36,314
What's the commitment
to deserving students in this room?

1180
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:39,547
Oh, please. I mean, we've got
top-notch minority applicants from...

1181
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:42,522
- Andover, uh, Phillips Exeter...
- Oh, this is completely outrageous, Leo.

1182
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:45,458
You know exactly how I feel
about giving this girl a chance.

1183
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,792
I think we all want
a reasonable solution. Leo?

1184
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:53,164
Well, I have no objections to the wait list.
Sally, how do you feel about that?

1185
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,602
The w... The wait list? That's like
falling into bureaucratic limbo.

1186
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:59,003
Nobody ever gets in here
on the wait list.

1187
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:01,372
Can we, uh, move on, please?

1188
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:23,255
Oh, my God.

1189
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,595
It's from Ramsey.

1190
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,870
Oh, it is.

1191
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:31,963
Somebody's gotta open it.

1192
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:36,640
I'll do it.

1193
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,386
[Crying]

1194
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:56,790
I'm so happy for you.
[Sobbing]

1195
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:03,371
You did it!
You got into Ramsey.

1196
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:06,908
- You did it.
- But what about Marlon Browne?

1197
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:13,776
[Laughs]
Sixty, 70, 80, 90...

1198
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:16,044
You look like a guy
who's obviously gonna make it.

1199
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,451
I'd better. I paid
a thousand bucks to Bauer-Benedek.

1200
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:22,183
They said stuff like this
would look great on my application.

1201
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,691
Did you hear
anything yet?

1202
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:28,024
Hey, cheer up.
Have a bumper sticker on me.

1203
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,058
- [Laughs]
- [Horn Honks]

1204
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:36,804
Come on, Ramsey.
What's going on?

1205
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,500
Now, I know this kid
seems hopeless on paper...

1206
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:44,511
but you gotta
see this tape.

1207
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:47,514
Now, I met him, and I think
he's really got somethin'.

1208
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:51,245
Oh, yeah? Better be
a union card.

1209
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,253
I don't know, Bob.

1210
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,687
Do we really have time
for this kind of tomfoolery?

1211
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:59,955
[Bob] Well, we are running late,
and tomorrow is the last day of admissions.

1212
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:04,055
There are just so many openings left. I don't
think this boy's folder warrants the time.

1213
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:07,431
We used to have time
for all types of kids.

1214
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,369
- I'd like to see the tape.
- You could give Flutter the tape.

1215
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:13,270
I'm not gonna look at it.
Besides, we gave you the Kailo girl.

1216
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,071
- Remember?
- No, Leo, you didn't give me anything.

1217
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:18,646
I mean, we're supposed to find
interesting students.

1218
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:21,079
Now, I think Marlon Browne
is one of them.

1219
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,981
Take another look
at Mr. Video's numbers.

1220
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:28,546
I don't know, Bob. I've gotta give this kid
two thumbs down on the Ramsey scale.

1221
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:33,060
Dean, I think it's a tragedy if we're saying
that the era of the still-searching...

1222
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:37,292
doesn't-know-exactly-
what-to-do-with-his-life kid
is over here at Ramsey.

1223
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,368
Yeah, well, it's canceled, all right,
due to poor ratings.

1224
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:42,733
- Do you understand, Hammett?
- Yeah, I get it, Leo.

1225
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,932
You got a new program...
Leo, Dean of Admissions.

1226
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,271
You know, I think
I'd watch that show.

1227
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:51,346
Well, I'm not gonna watch it
because with Leo, Dean of Admissions...

1228
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:54,814
calling the shots around here,
myjob description sucks.

1229
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:58,910
I don't wanna stay around here
and watch you ruin a place I love.

1230
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:06,083
So, Nina, looks like your lunch
schedule's opening wide up.

1231
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:08,493
Screw you, Leo.
Excuse me.

1232
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:14,194
[Door Closes]

1233
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,271
[Door Opens, Closes]

1234
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:23,144
Will you show me
Marlon's tape?

1235
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,713
Yeah. Sure.

1236
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:27,941
- Come on in.
- [Chuckles]

1237
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,917
Hi. I'm Marlon Browne,
and you wouldn't believe...

1238
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,818
all the stuff I did
trying to get into college.

1239
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:36,322
Looking back, the juggling
seems really pathetic.

1240
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:40,259
I know it was a creative activity
to put on my application and all...

1241
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:43,422
but I can't believe tossing
flaming sticks in the air...

1242
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:46,729
is gonna qualify me as
an interesting guy to have on campus.

1243
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:50,464
- [Stick Falls, Rattles]
- I felt I had to do something unusual...

1244
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:53,234
- [Cackles]
- [Marlon] But intramural, professional wrestling...

1245
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:55,401
was never a workable idea.

1246
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:58,309
[Yells, Grunts]

1247
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:00,882
- [Laughing]
- [Yelling Continues]

1248
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:11,023
[Marlon Narrating] I was desperate.
Everywhere I went, people told me...

1249
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:13,594
how competitive it is to get
into college these days.

1250
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:16,460
Here's some advice,
Marlon.

1251
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:20,023
- Hope for a miracle.
- That'll be $100.

1252
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:23,571
[Marlon Narrating] I came face to face
with the truth after my business failed.

1253
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,731
I got it, you guys.
Come on. Let's go!

1254
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,578
Grow up, Marlon.

1255
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,045
"Grow up."
That really got to me.

1256
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:38,950
It's something people tell me a lot.
And what am I supposed to answer?

1257
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:41,614
I'm growing
as fast as I can?

1258
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:44,591
Which brings me
to the point of my story.

1259
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:48,220
- Time to mature is what I need. Right, Willie?
- Right.

1260
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,230
Marlon's a great kid,
really.

1261
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:54,132
He just... He needs a little time
to develop, like a fine wine.

1262
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:56,864
If you give me a chance,
I will be the most...

1263
01:12:56,972 --> 01:13:00,430
enthusiastic, open-minded
student you have ever seen at Ramsey.

1264
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:03,443
- We could really use the room.
- [Laughs]

1265
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:07,641
Come on, Marlon.
Time for your next lesson.

1266
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,218
Well, gotta go.

1267
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:13,482
Please, consider me for Ramsey.
I won't let you down.

1268
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:17,388
- Leo's a pig.
- [Chuckles]

1269
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:19,393
Leo is six pigs.

1270
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:23,261
- [Laughs]
- Oh, God, I think I just got an idea.

1271
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,969
[Dog Barking, Growling]

1272
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,646
You. You're the mailman.

1273
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,946
Yeah.

1274
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:48,289
Who's it for?

1275
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,915
[Barking, Growling Continues]

1276
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:53,392
- Are you Marlon Browne?
- Yes.

1277
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:56,020
- It's for you.
- Where's it from?

1278
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:01,662
- Pennsylvania.
- Pennsylvania.

1279
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,637
Ramsey, Pennsylvania.
Would you do me a favor and open it?

1280
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,640
I can't look.
L-I'm too nervous.

1281
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:08,710
I'd love to.

1282
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:20,111
- Marlon Browne?
- Yes.

1283
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,053
Congratulations.

1284
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:24,887
I did it? I got into Ramsey?
It's from Ramsey?

1285
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:26,824
No. It's from Ed McMahon.

1286
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:30,956
You may have already
won $ 10 million.

1287
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:39,001
I get the feeling we could double our
endowment if we get a stronger student body...

1288
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:42,975
Leo, I believe this folder
escaped your attention.

1289
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:45,979
Thank you, Sally.

1290
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,145
Well, look who
just walked in.

1291
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:52,686
Mr. Grumpy decide
to finish his tenure?

1292
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:56,815
- Good to have you back, Kip.
- Last chance to admit the reject du jour, Kip.

1293
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:58,859
No, no.
That's your department, Leo.

1294
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:00,826
Au contraire, Kipster.

1295
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:04,558
It's the likes of Leonard Edward Funt
that catch my eye.

1296
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:08,102
Listen to these numbers...
800 verbal, 760 math...

1297
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:10,103
4.0 G.P.A.

1298
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:12,332
Second-ranked
in his class.

1299
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:17,105
I wonder which sophomoric admissions officer
kept this kid a secret. Kip?

1300
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:21,342
Leo, let me see that. I don't remember
hearing about this folder.

1301
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,077
- Who were the readers?
- I was.

1302
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,517
- [Chuckles] That figures.
- Oh, you too, Leo.

1303
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:27,452
Me and Flutter?

1304
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:29,581
- [Bob] Mm-hmm.
- Let me see that folder.

1305
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,093
Excuse me, Leo.

1306
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,129
Good Lord, Leo,
your comments are right here.

1307
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,960
"Leonard Edward Funt
is a first-rate specimen.

1308
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:41,035
- Don't let him slip away."
- [Leo] And I meant it.

1309
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:44,071
I mean, just looking at
those numbers makes my mouth water.

1310
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,800
I say we send a limo
unless Kip has an argument.

1311
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:49,434
- What the hell.
- Thank you, Kip.

1312
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:05,891
Now, as the new dean, I'm gonna
be making just a few changes.

1313
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:08,963
First of all, I'll be getting
a new paint job for the old Beemer.

1314
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,964
So I'm gonna need
two parking spaces.

1315
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:14,194
I might have to bump you
to the custodial parking lot. You mind?

1316
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,635
Okay, Leo.
Anything you say.

1317
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,638
I'm beginning
to like you, Flutter.

1318
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,174
Maybe I won't move your office
down to the basement.

1319
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:23,176
Leo...

1320
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:28,011
Uh, Mr. Funt has arrived, and Kip
thought you might wanna say hello.

1321
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:32,519
Leonard Edward Funt,
the new pride of Ramsey?

1322
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:36,148
Now we're gonna see the kind of student
we should be admitting to Ramsey.

1323
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,925
Now, Dean, I'm sure
you'll enjoy meeting...

1324
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:43,759
the kind of students
we should be admitting here at Ramsey.

1325
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:46,356
Students which I, as your successor,
would be very proud...

1326
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:48,368
to provide
for these hallowed halls.

1327
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,961
Leonard E. Funt
is one of my personal prides.

1328
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:53,041
- Leonard.
- [Flutter Chuckling]

1329
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:54,802
What is this thing?

1330
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,276
It's not a thing, Leo.
It's a pachyderm.

1331
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:58,937
L.E. Funt.

1332
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:01,140
The new pride of Ramsey.
[Chuckles]

1333
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:04,184
Leonard... Edward.
"El-ee-funt."

1334
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:06,982
Bob, please. You've got
to agree with me...

1335
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:10,684
that this prank is not
gonna look good on Hammett's record.

1336
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,885
What are you talking about?
I quit, remember?

1337
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:15,987
After fighting a losing battle
to admit a few good human beings.

1338
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:18,566
What's this?

1339
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:23,001
This is a filthy beast and a stupid prank,
compliments of Kip Hammett.

1340
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:27,007
- Oh, and me.
- Don't tell me this is Leonard Edward Funt.

1341
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,168
Yes, it is, Chancellor.

1342
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:31,302
- Joanna.
- [Sally Chuckles]

1343
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:34,780
He's got the perfect numbers. If these
standards had been used when I applied...

1344
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:36,783
you never
would have admitted me.

1345
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:39,149
And I think Ramsey and I
were a perfect match.

1346
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:41,722
So do I.

1347
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,848
That's all we wanted to say.
So good luck.

1348
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,891
- See you later.
- Wait!

1349
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:52,228
Maybe we've gone overboard, Leo.
Yes. I think they're right.

1350
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,529
What do you suggest
we do about this, Kip?

1351
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:58,663
Well, uh, we do have
a couple of suggestions.

1352
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:03,039
What about Leonard?
Is he going to Ramsey?

1353
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:07,013

he's got his heart set on Harvard.
