00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,900
PART THREE -
THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,500
The disappearance of Ernst Simon<i>...</i>

5
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,900
<i>...</i>who flew to the USSR in a private
plane in the summer of 1 990<i>...</i>

6
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,100
<i>...</i>occupied the German authorities
for over two years

7
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,400
They discovered his whereabouts
through diplomatic channels<i>...</i>

8
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,600
<i>...</i>and sought his return to Germany

9
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,700
His release from Russian prison<i>...</i>

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>...</i>is mainly due to the fact
that the USSR<i>...</i>

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,100
<i>...</i>whose laws he broke,
no longer exists

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,500
He should be arriving
on this Aeroflot plane from Moscow<i>...</i>

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,000
<i>...</i>after two years
of diplomatic efforts

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,500
This is our bag

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,700
This is ours

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,300
There's my accordion

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,200
Bring that, too

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,800
How is it
to be back in Germany?

19
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,300
Who cares?

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,400
But look at these people

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,400
It is they who deserve your attention

22
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,900
They weren't just held captive
in Russia for two years<i>...</i>

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,100
<i>...</i>but for up to three generations

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,400
First and foremost, I am
interested in their well-being<i>...</i>

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,000
<i>...</i>people of German heritage,
who have been pushed around<i>...</i>

26
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,500
<i>...</i>Iike cattle
since the days of Stalin

27
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,500
Every one of them<i>...</i>

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,500
<i>...</i>fought for years
to be able to live in Germany

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,500
Years of humiliation and suffering,
You should write about that

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,700
-Is this your child?
-Unfortunately not

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,500
This is the mother, Galina,
I'm afraid I never had children

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,600
Just imagine, the child
was born at Moscow Airport<i>...</i>

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,300
<i>...</i>just before we left

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,300
The family had really
wanted it to be born in Germany

35
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,900
His name is Nikita

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Niko, ln German, Niko

37
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,300
-Come on
-Excuse me

38
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,300
Germany

39
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,800
<i>When I left for foreign lands</i>

40
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,900
<i>I left you behind, my homeland</i>

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,300
<i>I was sad and longed to return</i>

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,500
<i>To the place where love awaits me</i>

43
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,800
<i>This time of separation will be over</i>

44
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,900
The Lorelei! Do you know that song?

45
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,600
<i>I'm looking in vain for the reason</i>

46
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,100
<i>That I'm so sad and distressed</i>

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,600
<i>A tale known for many a season</i>

48
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,100
<i>Will not allow me to rest</i>

49
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,100
We're going up to Hunsrück

50
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,200
Hunsrück

51
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,700
Pine tree

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,900
Tell Galina to be quiet and listen,
She will learn German customs from us

53
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,900
Tell her she could only come
because she's married to you

54
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,800
My German husband

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,700
-You have a key?
-I used to have one

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,700
We have kept an eye on your house,
but we let the grass grow

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,600
It doesn't matter,
I have a bolt cutter

58
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,200
You're safe here

59
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,400
God, thou art eternal

60
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,900
God of life and love,
creator of earth and man

61
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,700
We thank you
for hearing our prayers

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,800
Some of the weapons that
threatened us and our children<i>...</i>

63
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,200
<i>...</i>for so many decades are being
flown back and dismantled

64
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,800
We thank you, Lord, for enlightening
the hearts of the mighty<i>...</i>

65
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,900
<i>...</i>and showing them
the way to peace at last<i>...</i>

66
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,900
-Have you seen it yet?
-No, Good God!

67
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,800
The dollar is going,
and the rouble is coming

68
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,800
Don't look on the gloomy side

69
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,700
''Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done<i>...</i>

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
''<i>...</i>on earth as it is in heaven

71
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,500
''Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses<i>...</i>

72
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,400
''<i>...</i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us

73
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,000
''Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil<i>...</i>''

74
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,300
Look at this,
The glass shattered in my hand

75
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,500
Imagine that!

76
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,600
Hermann<i>...</i>

77
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,900
Can you hear that?

78
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,000
-Maybe an echo from the aeroplanes
-No, lt's a high-pitched tone

79
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,500
What do you mean?

80
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
That sound, I'm sure you can hear it

81
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,200
Is your computer still on?

82
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,100
I'm sure it's turned off

83
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,800
CIarissa

84
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,500
It's here in this room

85
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,900
Do you know what tinnitus is?

86
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,900
It's loudest when I'm near you

87
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,400
I'm sorry,
but you must be able to hear it

88
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,900
Isn't it strange with us
and our love nest up here?

89
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,800
The house of the dead poetess

90
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Last summer, the up-draughts
from the valley<i>...</i>

91
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,300
<i>...</i>that no one could explain to us

92
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,000
The voices of American
flight controllers in the radiators

93
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
You can't have forgotten that

94
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,100
Thank goodness they have gone

95
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,700
Broken windows<i>...</i>

96
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,500
<i>...</i>a bubbling sound
in the heating pipes<i>...</i>

97
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,500
<i>...</i>and now<i>...</i>

98
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,900
Now I'm going to take an aspirin

99
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,700
Maybe the house doesn't want us,
and it's rebelling

100
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,800
They have
a huge sports centre back there

101
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,400
A basketball court, a handball court,
a bike track, a volleyball court<i>...</i>

102
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,300
-Really?
-A huge supermarket and a laundry<i>...</i>

103
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,400
All brand new, They closed them down
before they even opened them

104
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,700
-Hi, Rudi
-Hi, Toni

105
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,800
-Hi, Rudi
-Hi, EIfi

106
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,000
That's a B52 squadron

107
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,700
I remember them
and how they sounded

108
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,500
''The Love Machine'',
but they are planes of death

109
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,900
That nice dog Snoopy
sitting in an aeroplane<i>...</i>

110
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,300
<i>...</i>a fighter plane with bombs

111
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,500
The victory they are celebrating
is the atom bomb

112
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,000
There is a mushroom cloud

113
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,900
<i>American troops were stationed here</i>
<i>in Hunsrück for nearly fifty years</i>

114
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,900
<i>Dozens of arsenals, missile bases...</i>

115
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,900
<i>...and the enormous</i>
<i>Hahn Military Airbase</i>

116
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,700
<i>There was a permanent threat of war</i>

117
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,900
<i>When the Berlin Wall fell,</i>
<i>the troops finally withdrew ...</i>

118
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,800
<i>...and took their deadly arsenals</i>
<i>with them</i>

119
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,900
<i>They not only left</i>
<i>several buildings empty</i>

120
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,300
<i>Several residents of Hunsrück</i>
<i>also had an empty feeling</i>

121
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,800
<i>In those days, tens of thousands</i>
<i>of people with German ancestors...</i>

122
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,300
<i>...flocked from the declining Soviet Union</i>
<i>in search of a new homeland</i>

123
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,400
<i>''The Russians'',</i>
<i>as they were called...</i>

124
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,800
<i>...moved into the empty flats</i>
<i>left by the Americans...</i>

125
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,900
<i>...thus filling up the empty space</i>

126
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,500
Well, Nikitoshka,
a new time is beginning<i>...</i>

127
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,500
<i>...</i>for you and for me
and for your daddy, too

128
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,600
Yuri, come here, Look at her hair

129
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,400
It's fantastic, Come and feel it

130
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,500
You speak German, too?

131
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,000
Let's go and get the fridge

132
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,100
You have a nice flat

133
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:56,100
Yuri, your fridge, Look

134
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
And this is the transformer for it

135
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,200
We'll store it in the vicarage
until you have found a flat

136
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,600
For me?

137
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,800
Thank you, Thank you very much

138
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,300
Look, Yuri

139
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,600
I've found a flat for us

140
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,100
Don't worry,
Your mummy will be here soon

141
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,500
I would love to keep you here<i>...</i>

142
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,800
<i>...</i>but you belong to your people

143
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,700
They must become German

144
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,200
Conquering the ''Golden West''<i>...</i>

145
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,700
<i>...</i>a fridge, a TV<i>...</i>

146
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,700
<i>...</i>nice clothes, travelling<i>...</i>

147
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,500
<i>...</i>freedom

148
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,100
Don't stare at me
with those Russian eyes

149
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,500
I've just got used to you all,
and now you are moving on

150
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,200
Now this house has lost its sunshine,
You understand, Galina?

151
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,200
And the cradle,
if you leave it here<i>...</i>

152
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,400
I mean, I won't like the room
you stayed in any more

153
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,600
Give me a hand

154
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,700
Ernst, thank you so much,
Thank you for everything

155
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,900
-Goodbye
-I was glad to help, All the best

156
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,800
Schabbach isn't as far away
as Kazakhstan

157
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,400
-By plane, it takes a minute
-Yes

158
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
You're a very good person

159

Tobi told me about you

175
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,500
-He's not here?
-He's by the River EIbe

176
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,200
Not far from the road,
near Laubegast<i>...</i>

177
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,000
<i>...</i>if you want to go there now

178
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,000
But why don't you come in first?

179
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,000
-You must be Anna
-Yes, This is for your plane

180
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,100
-It's for your aeroplane
-I don't have it any more

181
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,100
We were at the anti-right wing march
yesterday, Everybody had candles

182
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,500
-And Anna was there, too
-Anti-right wing

183
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,100
It can't be

184
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,700
Tobi

185
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,200
You're really famous now,
I read about you in <i>Stern</i>

186
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Forget about that

187
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,100
-So, how far did you get?
-As far as Minsk

188
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,500
-Then my premonition was right
-I had a real chance

189
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,000
-So, did you buy any pictures?
-Actually, I didn't

190
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,000
At least it happened
on the way there

191
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,300
If they had caught you
smuggling on the way back<i>...</i>

192
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,400
<i>...</i>you would be in Siberia
without a return ticket

193
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,900
So what did it cost to get out?

194
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,500
Tobi, it has nothing to do with money

195
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,900
I worried all that time in vain<i>...</i>

196
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,500
<i>...</i>and waited for eighteen months
until I got this job

197
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
What is that?

198
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,600
''Land Art,'' a mobile installation

199
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,100
We'll hang it over
the EIbe shipping route

200
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,500
All ships passing from
the Czech Republic to Hamburg<i>...</i>

201
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,500
<i>...</i>and the passenger ships
heading for Saxony's hills will see

202
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,100
''Land Art''

203
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,900
What's it got to do with art?

204
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,700
Ernst, if some middle class type
were to ask that, then OK

205
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,900
But you? You understand
the symbolism, don't you?

206
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,300
Yes, it weighs ten tonnes,
You can't take it with you

207
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,100
Maybe that's what bothers you

208
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,600
It's too obvious

209
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,000
A poor man's Calder and Christo

210
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,200
The message you left me
mentioned the future

211
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,700
I just came to tell you
that my offer still stands

212
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,500
Harry, who is up there
on the platform<i>...</i>

213
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,500
<i>...</i>is the artist

214
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,100
He still has lots of projects
he wants to carry out<i>...</i>

215
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,000
<i>...</i>a water wheel,
fifty metres in diameter<i>...</i>

216
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,000
<i>...</i>a celestial ladder,
a hundred metres high<i>...</i>

217
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,500
<i>...</i>a horse that hovers
twenty-five metres above the water

218
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,900
When he talks about his visions,
everybody says, ''That won't work''

219
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
He needs me

220
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,000
He depends on me

221
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Hello there

222
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,500
My name is Simon, This is Mr Pfeiler,
my engineer, Let's have a look

223
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,600
<i>Sometimes, everything changes</i>

224
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,200
<i>When the Wall fell, it wasn't</i>
<i>just a revolution in the East</i>

225
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,000
<i>Things started changing</i>
<i>in Hunsrück, too</i>

226
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,100
<i>The former Hahn Airbase...</i>

227
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,500
<i>...was now a very desirable property</i>

228
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,300
<i>An area of seven thousand hectares</i>
<i>with countless empty buildings...</i>

229
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,800
<i>...and a runway in perfect condition</i>

230
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,700
<i>It had the infrastructure</i>
<i>of a large airport</i>

231
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,700
<i>That was bound to stir up emotions</i>

232
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,800
<i>Was this the beginning of a decline,</i>
<i>or the emergence of a new era?</i>

233
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,300
<i>For me,</i>
<i>that was the question of the time</i>

234
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,500
-Possibly a canteen, How big is it?
-At least three hundred square metres

235
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,300
-Three hundred, Fine, thank you
-Wonderful

236
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,300
Here's the ballroom

237
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,800
Bands performed here,
and they had tap dances here, too

238
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,000
I see

239
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,300
Wonderful

240
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Strange acoustics, Mr Simon

241
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,100
Fine, We'll use the room
for manufacturing

242
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,200
It's great with no windows,
That way no one can spy on us

243
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,600
-You're right
-What about the offices?

244
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,100
No problem, The walls are flexible,
You can push them aside

245
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,600
There's the same amount
of space here<i>...</i>

246
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,700
<i>...</i>and a big kitchen at the back

247
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,000
What do you say, Mr Pfeiffer?
Could this be our new empire?

248
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,600
It's just right, Mr Simon

249
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,400
DOCTOR ON DUTY

250
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,100
Is the doctor in? For my child

251
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,100
PIease make sure he takes
his medication regularly<i>...</i>

252
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,400
<i>...</i>and on time

253
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,900
-And he must rest
-OK

254
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,700
Doctor, the Russian woman<i>...</i>
Her child seems to be quite ill

255
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,400
Hartmut

256
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:09,200
-You know what creditworthiness is?
-What are you trying to teach me now?

257
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,300
I'm forty-two, At my age,
you were in charge of the company

258
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,300
-I can do it, too
-Look at me when I talk to you

259
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,500
You have always had everything -
vitamins, healthy air<i>...</i>

260
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,200
<i>...</i>every kind of toy<i>...</i>

261
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,900
<i>...</i>vintage cars, your sailboat

262
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,700
You have always had a good life,
from your earliest childhood

263
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,500
-Right?
-That's not the point

264
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,500
Yes, it is,
You have never known poverty

265
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
Even the word is unfamiliar to you

266
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,200
But I don't blame you

267
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,500
You're a child born in good times

268
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,100
It's what every father
wants for his children

269
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,700
But that's the very reason
I don't trust you

270
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,800
I'm no longer a child,
So stop using that word

271
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,300
The market has changed

272
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,900
We're stuck with dozens
of unused patents

273
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,600
It's capital that has to be used

274
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,500
And with the airbase available,
we can expand free of charge

275
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,400
Production space, great transport
connections, a large workforce

276
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,200
We won't
get another chance like this

277
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Father

278
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,800
You have to be creative these days

279
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,100
''Creative,'' What an awful word

280
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,200
The most unimaginative fools
are creative

281
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,300
The stupidest idiots are creative

282
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,900
They are creative in the morning,
at noon, in the evening

283
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,300
They are especially creative at night

284
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Let me tell you this, Hartmut

285
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,400
He who marries the <i>zeitgeist</i>
will be widowed at an early age

286
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,800
I need money because<i>...</i>

287
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,900
<i>...</i>I want to start my own business

288
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,300
What money?

289
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,200
You and I can't agree,
so I want my share of the firm

290
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,700
I own twenty-five per cent,
but I have no say

291
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,800
I want to escape from your clutches

292
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,500
Well, that's nice!

293
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,600
My own son uses my own money
to become my competitor

294
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,600
It's out of the question!

295
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,900
Do you really want a legal battle
between father and son?

296
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,300
You're just like
my brother Ernst - a gambler

297
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Lift it up a bit

298
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,900
He'll get better here,
I'm sure of that

299
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,100
-Hello, Uncle Ernst
-Hartmut, what a surprise

300
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,100
Hello there<i>...</i> you old gambler

301
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,500
You talk just like your old man

302
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,300
I told him that I've resigned,
I'm starting my own business

303
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,700
Oh boy, there will be trouble

304
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,800
Is that why you're here?

305
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,300
You were away for a long time

306
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,900
No one else in the family
has visited you<i>...</i>

307
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,700
That's enough nonsense, Hartmut,
Just tell me what you want

308
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,100
-I need start-up capital
-Start-up capital?

309
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,600
So you thought of me?

310
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,300
No money,
but a guarantee would be helpful

311
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,500
I want to show my old man
that he has limitations

312
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,500
He does have limitations

313
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,900
Good luck

314
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,500
A guarantee?

315
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,500
CIarissa, they're here

316
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,400
-Hello there
-This is CIarissa

317
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,700
-Hi
-Hello

318
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,500
We've been expecting you

319
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,800
Damn! That superstitious rubbish
is no help at all

320
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,900
RADIO-AESTHETIC TESTING

321
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,400
MEASUREMENT OF RADIATION
IN LIVING AREAS AND BEDROOMS

322
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,700
Bernd

323
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Yes<i>...</i>

324
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,400
Why don't you ask me what I'm doing?

325
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,400
All right, what are you doing?

326
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,900
I've just made it to Level Five
for the first time

327
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,000
My eight-year-old always does it

328
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,200
I thought you were
calculating something

329
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,200
I got back from the USA at 8:1 6am,
Frankfurt Airport

330
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,800
I haven't seen my wife
or daughter for seven weeks

331
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,200
I haven't been on holiday for years,
I've forgotten what holidays are

332
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,700
-What do you do?
-Everything

333
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,200
What about you?

334
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,800
Let me guess, You're<i>...</i> an artist

335
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,600
An architect?

336
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
-A designer?
-I'm a musician

337
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,000
So you're not going
to the Leipzig Trade Fair?

338
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,300
No

339
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,300
Picture the scene

340
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,300
There's a dynamic, middle-sized
company in Württemberg

341
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,500
It produces radiators for heating

342
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,500
A top-quality product,
well-made, a brand name

343
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,500
We also sell radiators

344
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,600
DIY superstores
in the former East Germany

345
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,700
Our radiators are rubbish

346
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,200
Even the East Germans
are not deceived by a cheap price

347
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,600
So I go to that Swabian factory
and buy a year's worth of radiators

348
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,600
The owner is delighted, He expands
production and employs more people

349
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,400
The next year we get him
to lower the price

350
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,200
We order twice as many<i>...</i>

351
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,800
<i>...</i>because there's
a redevelopment boom in the East

352
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,100
The manufacturer
moans about our price policy<i>...</i>

353
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,100
<i>...</i>but he accepts the deal, because
he has to amortise his investment

354
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,000
But our order
forces him to invest more

355
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,500
We give him a loan,
He is unable to deliver on time

356
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,700
We give him another loan,
and he hires more people

357
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,500
He gets a community service award

358
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,900
He is praised as courageous,
but he's dependent on us

359
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,200
Do you understand?

360
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,800
The Swabian isn't able
to meet payments<i>...</i>

361
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,800
<i>...</i>although the firm
is doing better than ever

362
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,000
That's when we act

363
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,700
We deliver him from his agony
and buy his factory for peanuts

364
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,000
Recently, a man in this position
committed suicide<i>...</i>

365
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,700
<i>...</i>with his wife and kids
in Göppingen

366
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,200
What's your role in this?

367
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,100
I'm the ''business terminator''

368
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,300
That is my job

369
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,700
If I took a week's holiday,
I would be replaced by a younger man

370
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,100
The American system

371
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,500
We usually don't keep
the companies we snatch

372
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,900
We close them down and sell
their know-how to the Far East

373
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,500
I liked the radiator manufacturer

374
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,600
I was with his family
Iast year at Christmas<i>...</i>

375
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,300
<i>...</i>in the mountains in Swabia

376
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,000
Six hours of freedom<i>...</i>

377
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,300
<i>...</i>in fresh snow

378
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,700
I've often imagined<i>...</i>

379
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,200
<i>...</i>driving to Düsseldorf one day<i>...</i>

380
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,500
<i>...</i>going to the eleventh floor<i>...</i>

381
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,500
<i>...</i>dropping my trousers
and taking a crap at my boss's door

382
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,400
A huge crap

383
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,500
Then<i>...</i> I would elegantly
take my leave

384
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,900
And I would enjoy
sweet freedom once again

385
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,900
So you're a musician?

386
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,300
I'm also full of unfulfilled dreams

387
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,000
It was nice to speak my mind

388
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,600
LEIPZIG CENTRAL STATION

389
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,900
Mr Simon?

390
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,400
Hey, you nearly ran straight past me

391
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,100
-Udo, how nice of you to pick me up
-Welcome to the Trade Fair city

392
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,400
When I saw the attics here,
I thought, ''What a view

393
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,600
''I would envy someone living there''

394
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,300
So I had an idea,
and it grew and grew<i>...</i>

395
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,200
<i>...</i>and - hey presto -
I was an estate agent

396
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,700
An expert in attics and interiors

397
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,500
I call it ''Restoration East''

398
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,300
Business is going so well,
I can't find enough staff

399
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,100
The whole town centre
has attic flats - my achievement

400
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,400
The attic above Auerbach's Cellar -
you know your Goethe

401
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,700
Mädler Passage, Speck Courtyard -
nice attic flats now

402
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,900
Heavens above!

403
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,100
Jana, get out of the flowerbed,
What will people think?

404
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,700
Don't be like that

405
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Hello

406
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,200
You're here! Welcome,
It's so nice that you are in Leipzig

407
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,400
Doesn't Udo look smart?
You see, we keep up with the times

408
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,300
The whole place will be rebuilt

409
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,000
The flats are getting
a new floor plan

410
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,400
A conservatory, a living room,
a dining room and a hallway<i>...</i>

411
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,500
<i>...</i>all with parquet flooring

412
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,900
The bathrooms will have
Carrara marble and a jacuzzi<i>...</i>

413
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,900
<i>...</i>and the fixtures will be gilded
or brushed stainless steel

414
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,600
-What?
-Brushed stainless steel

415
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,800
I see

416
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,100
And there are luxurious
brand-name fitted kitchens<i>...</i>

417
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,700
<i>...</i>with granite counters
and 1 70-Iitre fridges

418
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,100
Hey, lads, keep the noise down

419
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,400
And a freezer and a dishwasher

420
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,500
Before the Berlin Wall fell,
there were four families living here

421
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,900
They shared the kitchen and toilet,
You can imagine what it was like

422
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
This is it<i>...</i>

423
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,900
<i>...</i>our catalogue

424
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,700
Have a look, You won't find anything
this inexpensive in Leipzig

425
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,800
And it will solve
your tax problems in one go

426
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,300
Instead of giving
the taxman your money<i>...</i>

427
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,700
<i>...</i>invest in property
in the beautiful town of Leipzig

428
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,700
Fifty per cent tax depreciation

429
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,700
You only have to pay
eight per cent property tax

430
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,700
You can't save that much
on taxes in the West

431
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,100
You can't

432
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,700
You understand more
about capitalism than I do

433
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,700
-If you don't turn on the gas<i>...</i>
-First of all - hello

434
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,700
I didn't turn it off,
Talk to the property manager

435
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,200
Does the attic
remind you of anything?

436
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,500
Look at this view

437
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,900
It may not be the Rhine,
but it's fantastic

438
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,300
For a south-facing terrace like this,
people will pay anything

439
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,500
It's the kind of flat
you fall in love with

440
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,500
I'm sorry, Udo

441
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,800
Brigitte, listen,
Something strange has happened

442
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,600
I know, I can hardly
believe it myself

443
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,400
Since we have had the child here,
my entire perception has changed

444
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,700
Yes<i>...</i> yes<i>...</i>

445
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,900
I never felt I was missing anything
without a child

446
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,800
But now<i>...</i>

447
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,900
Remember when you were pregnant?
You said a similar thing yourself

448
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,700
Yes, exactly

449
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,500
Yes<i>...</i> I know

450
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It was crazy

451
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,700
Brigitte, I have to go now, Bye

452
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,900
We've got something to celebrate,
Ernst has signed it

453
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,300
-Oh, what's wrong?
-The guarantee

454
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,300
Oh, little one, come here

455
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,300
Come here, little one

456
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,700
-Galina, I think he needs you
-He's hungry

457
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,700
Yes, yes, baby, You want to eat

458
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,100

There's your tone

00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,300
-Lulu!
-We wanted to see if you were home

479
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,500
What a surprise

480
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,200
You've finally come to see us

481
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:07,200
Hello<i>...</i> So you came all the way
from Cologne by bike?

482
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,600
Not quite

483
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,000
Last night,
we camped in the Eifel area

484
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,800
-Can we sleep here?
-Yes, of course

485
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,700
Why not?

486
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,700
CIarissa

487
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,800
Welcome, I'm happy to be able
to welcome you here at last

488
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,900
This is it

489
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,100
Your love nest

490
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,100
It's very big

491
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,500
We could see it from a distance

492
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,700
Do come in

493
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,100
So<i>...</i> what's it like
Iiving with my daddy?

494
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,900
Things are going well,
We're having a creative year

495
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,200
Hermann is composing,
I'm preparing a solo presentation

496
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,700
And I look after the goat

497
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,100
-You have a goat?
-Bianca

498
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,700
It was a long struggle for us
to get our freedom

499
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,100
We had to turn down
some great offers<i>...</i>

500
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,400
<i>...</i>and learn to say no

501
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,200
But why else do we have
this beautiful house?

502
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
We really enjoy being home at last

503
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,900
So<i>...</i>

504
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,500
<i>...</i>what do your friends do?

505
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,400
How I hate questions like that

506
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,000
I'm sorry

507
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,700
Shouldn't I show an interest?
What's wrong with that?

508
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,200
Everything is wrong with it,
I know how you judge people

509
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,000
Normally<i>...</i> Listen to me

510
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,300
Normally, people are happy
to be asked about themselves

511
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,200
But not you, Lulu,
You expect me to know the answers

512
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,500
All right,
Lutz is a medical student<i>...</i>

513
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,700
<i>...</i>in his sixth year, specialising
in paediatrics - a paediatrician

514
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,600
His gross income
is 2,400 marks a month

515
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,600
At Cologne University Hospital

516
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,900
And Roland<i>...</i>

517
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,100
Roland studies architecture like me,
in his third year

518
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,600
His income is zero

519
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,000
My income is the same,
Father supports me

520
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,300
His student grant - 8 70 marks

521
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,200
Satisfied?

522
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,500
-Enough information?
-Here

523
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,600
A little refreshment for the cyclists

524
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,300
How about you, Lulu?

525
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,500
You two should let bygones be bygones

526
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:17,900
Hermann is so happy you've come,
and I love unexpected guests

527
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,400
You can stay longer, if you like

528
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,600
Do you know about
the big celebrations tonight?

529
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,000
Yes, the ''Rhine in FIames,''
Why do you think we're here?

530
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,700
How long are you
going to be travelling?

531
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,000
We aren't sure

532
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,800
A week<i>...</i>

533
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,900
I don't know if you know this,
but Lulu was brought up by her mother

534
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,700
We hardly see each other,
so that's why I'm especially glad<i>...</i>

535
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,900
The old goat!

536
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,100
Hi there, I'm here

537
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,100
Hello

538
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,100
Come on, I'll show you

539
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,500
-Hello there
-Hello

540
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,600
That's fifty marks
plus travel expenses

541
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,900
-Now or later?
-Now, of course

542
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,000
I see, Just a moment

543
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,100
Don't think about
doing this a second time

544
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,700
It can't happen, I must look after
my goat, lt's his busiest time

545
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,200
-Will you hold her?
-No, She has to do it voluntarily

546
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,100
But has she been restless?

547
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,500
Like the book says<i>...</i>

548
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,300
''Restless, bleating, tail wagging,
The vagina red and swollen''

549
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,300
Well then<i>...</i>

550
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,400
-Tillmann?
-Oh, Moni<i>...</i>

551
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,700
Thanks, I'll just do a little more

552
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,100
-Can I have a bite?
-What about me?

553
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,800
Who will jump with me?

554
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,100
Roland?

555
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,200
I will

556
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,900
I'm with you

557
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,800
So, how was it?

558
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,700
More beautiful than getting married

559
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,400
It's time you two made up,
You are the most mature one

560
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:24,700
She's still afraid of having
to decide between you and her mother

561
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,500
That's how it is
with the kids of divorced parents

562
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,900
-I know from little Arnold
-They are not children any more

563
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,400
Maybe they are

564
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,300
She has never come to see me
without asking for money

565
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,900
Maybe that was the only way
to feel she had a father

566
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,100
How's the ringing in your ear?

567
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,400
Just what is wrong with us, CIarissa?

568
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:08,800
We're at the most beautiful spot on earth,
but we can't find our peace

569
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,100
I struggle with my compositions
as if I were completely untalented

570
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,900
I construct things<i>...</i>

571
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:20,300
<i>...</i>I philosophise, I make drawings,
I develop the wildest theories<i>...</i>

572
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,900
<i>...</i>with my students
about the process of unification

573
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,500
But to be honest<i>...</i>

574
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,700
<i>...</i>CIarissa, I have no ideas

575
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:50,700
<i>A spotless rose is growing</i>

576
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,700
<i>Sprung from a tender root</i>

577
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:02,600
<i>Of ancient seers' foreshowing</i>

578
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:08,800
<i>Of Jesse promised fruit</i>

579
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,700
<i>Its fairest bud unfolds to light</i>

580
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,700
<i>Amid the cold, cold winter</i>

581
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,300
<i>And in the dark midnight</i>

582
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,100
Christmas blessings

583
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,800
The same to you

584
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,300
-Merry Christmas
-Thank you, Merry Christmas

585
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,600
-Merry Christmas
-Galina<i>...</i>

586
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,800
-Thank you
-Just a moment, For your husband

587
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,400
Oh, thank you, Merry Christmas

588
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,000
Hartmut

589
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,500
Come here

590
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,200
Christmas
is the time of reconciliation

591
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,200
Peace

592
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,900
And even if Ernst
Iends you millions<i>...</i>

593
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,600
peace

594
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,500
We don't live forever

595
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:20,000
Now come home with us,
We have two geese in the oven

596
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,700
And the pretty Russian girl
is helping with the serving

597
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,900
Merry Christmas

598
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,600
A special offer,
only 1 1 ,90 a bottle

599
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,100
Fermentation in the bottle,
<i>brut de brut</i>

600
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,700
No idea how they do it
for that price

601
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,900
So, we have twenty bottles of this

602
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,700
I think it's wonderful<i>...</i>

603
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,500
<i>...</i>to see all of you
seated at this table

604
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,900
It's a tradition now

605
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,800
This is the eleventh time that
we've sat together on Christmas Eve<i>...</i>

606
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:16,000
<i>...</i>and our number is growing,
right, Mara?

607
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,300
You count as two now,
and I'm proud of you

608
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,600
Sorry, Hartmut, but as you see
I know everything

609
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,500
We've always had an open house here,
You all know that

610
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,100
That's why I'm happy<i>...</i>

611
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:36,100
<i>...</i>that a real angel has flown to us
all the way from Kazakhstan

612
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,300
Hanni, open the door
and let her in

613
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,500
You look like you could be in a film

614
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:54,100
I once played a woman like this
in a school play

615
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,200
-It was Chekhov
-Have you acted?

616
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,700
-Yes
-I knew it

617
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:03,500
Then show us your talents,
Hanni, give her the soup tureen

618
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,600
Right then, make your entrance,
Go out and come back in

619
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,500
Watch this,
She's going to come around the corner

620
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,300
Around the corner

621
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,700
-Can you curtsy?
-Curtsy<i>...</i> like this

622
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,900
Like this?

623
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,600
It's good the tureen was empty,
But you'll learn

624
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,900
-You're with us now
-That's enough, Father

625
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,700
I won't put up with this farce

626
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:50,100
Are we in the days of
the Kaiser or Chancellor Adenauer?

627
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,700
You're stuck in the past

628
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,800
You're an antique,
I've always wanted to say that

629
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:59,500
I'm going to throw out everybody
who ever curtsied to you<i>...</i>

630
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,600
<i>...</i>so we can start a new era

631
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,700
-There
-Hartmut

632
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,300
So, Merry Christmas!
Come on, Galina, let's go

633
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,000
You didn't deserve that

634
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:18,200
You don't need to do this, Galina,
You're too good for it

635
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,000
You don't deserve
to be treated like that

636
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,500
I have a child and my husband
and I have work

637
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,800
I'm a cheerful young person,
I'll do any job, you understand?

638
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,100
In Germany, I do anything
and I smile, You understand?

639
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,300
Yes

640
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,500
''SIM-ON 1 ,''
So it's true he has a big contract

641
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,300
-I didn't think he would do it
-No

642
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,600
Hello, Postovich

643
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,500
-Can I help you?
-''Postovich''?

644
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,700
In Russia, we were the fascists,
Here we are the Russians

645
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,200
-Will we ever be Germans?
-Don't take it so seriously

646
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,600
I didn't mean it that way,
To us, you're Postovich

647
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,300
Get used to it

648
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,200
Come in, I'll give you a beer

649
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,500
No, thanks, No alcohol at work

650
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,200
I see, So you are a real German!

651
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,000
-Hello, Hartmut, How are things?
-Fine

652
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,200
-You have another new car, eh?
-Yes

653
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,400
Mara

654
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,500
Are you here, Mara?

655
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,100
Can't give up riding, eh?

656
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:01,400
Hartmut, he wouldn't hurt me,
He can tell that I'm pregnant

657
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:02,900
Right?

658
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,300
We'll soon
be at the tournaments again

659
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,400
Want to see my new car?

660
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,800
When will you ever
grow up, Hartmut?

661
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,800
Hi, Where's Niko?

662
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,800
With his <i>baboushka</i>

663
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,900
Why are you so sad?

664
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,500
You know what I do
when I don't feel happy?

665
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,500
Come, Take a ride
with me through Hunsrück

666
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,100
-You can get to know the area
-I have to work

667
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:18,100
-If I say so, then you're off work
-But my work isn't finished yet

668
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,100
I must clean the windows
and beat the carpets

669
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,700
-Did my father tell you to do that?
-No, your wife

670
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:31,000
-She's off with her horses
-I know, I love horses, too

671
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,800
But this car isn't bad, is it?

672
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,500
-It has 250hp
-What's ''hp''?

673
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:41,800
Horsepower

674
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,600
It's a real experience,
Come on, give it a try

675
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,900
Get in, Just a little drive,
You won't regret it

676
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,900
Come on

677
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,200
Just sit down

678
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,700
-Feels good, eh?
-Yes

679
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,100
It's Californian buffalo leather,
Straight from the Wild West

680
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:29,100
-Shall we go fast?
-No, I have to work

681
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,600
Here, I'll help you
take off your rubber boots

682
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,400
They are very dirty

683
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,200
Well, that's simple

684
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,900
And take the apron off, too

685
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,500
What is the car called?

686
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,700
Porsche Carrera 964, Special edition

687
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:07,700
Right, now hold on tight
and you'll see<i>...</i>

688
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,100
<i>...</i>that Hunsrück is a beautiful area

689
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:14,100
Endless fields, hills and forests<i>...</i>

690
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,000
<i>...</i>and a sky that is always changing

691
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:21,300
Hunsrück is the heart
of all Germany, yes?

692
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,800
Exactly, That's Hunsrück

693
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:33,100
I have reason to celebrate,
The bank approved the entire loan

694
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,300
My company is really taking off now

695
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,700
I can give Ernst back his guarantee,
and I'm going to employ eighty people

696
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,300
We have to understand
the signs of the times

697
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,800
Neither of us must bow down
to the old man any more

698
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,200
Not you and not me

699
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,700
-Isn't that nice?
-Nice

700
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
You're laughing

701
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:09,900
You know, Galina,
nothing would stop me if I were you

702
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,800
Shall I help you
to get out of this mess?

703
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,700
Get rid of everything that's holding
you back - your whole family

704
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,700
They're like a lead weight

705
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,700
If I were you, I would drive away
in the fast lane

706
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,300
Galina, with your charisma,
you can do whatever you want

707
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,600
What is it? What's wrong?

708
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,200
I'm thinking of Yuri

709
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,500
Your husband?

710
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,100
He is in pain day and night

711
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,500
-That's what is on your mind?
-Yes

712
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:31,300
They operated on his knee
five times in Kazakhstan

713
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,700
On the plantation
there was an accident

714
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,800
Look<i>...</i> here, here and here

715
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,400
-Oh, shit
-That's what I feel, too

716
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,400
Have him show me his knee

717
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Wait a minute

718
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,800
-I'm Hartmut
-Yuri

719
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,400
Well<i>...</i> your wife told me about it

720
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,100
May I have a look?

721
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,100
Here, as well

722
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,300
That looks terrible

723
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:10,100
Yuri was the director
of the entire plantation<i>...</i>

724
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,200
<i>...</i>with eight hundred staff

725
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:15,400
We have to do something

726
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:21,800
Look, a friend of mine is a specialist,
I'll give him a call

727
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,300
Hello, ls that the surgery ward?

728
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:42,700
This is Mr Simon, I'd like to talk
to Professor Petri, ls he there?

729
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,500
Gerhard, it's me, Hartmut

730
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,300
Fine, thanks, And yourself?

731
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,700
That's what I always say

732
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,900
Anyway, I have a man from Kazakhstan
with a bad knee

733
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,000
It's terrible<i>...</i>
Looks really gruesome

734
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:07,600
No idea, SIoppy Russian doctors,
They cut it open several times

735
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,700
Could you take a look at it? Yes?

736
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,100
This week? Great

737
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,600
Yes, I owe you one, Let's do it

738
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:23,100
How about a round of golf?
OK, great

739
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,500
Thanks a lot, OK, bye

740
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,300
It worked, Did you hear?

741
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,900
So, it's Professor Gerhard Petri,
Mainz University Hospital

742
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:42,900
Just call, make an appointment and
give him regards from Hartmut Simon

743
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:49,100
So, all the best<i>...</i> Bye

744
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,900
Who's he doing this for? For you?

745
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,500
We're in Germany,
and I want you to get well again

746
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,300
What's this?

747
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,500
For you<i>...</i> a little surprise,
Smell it

748
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,700
It stinks, Where is it from?

749
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,400
-It doesn't matter
-Do you know who you're talking to?

750
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,700
-Smell it
-I already have

751
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,900
Why are you so angry?
Everyone is so good to you<i>...</i>

752
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,400
You're acting like a slut

753
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,100
Go wash yourself

754
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,100
Go wash yourself

755
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,700
Professor Petri

756
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,500
This is the most modern one
available, lt's an artificial knee

757
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,100
It replaces the worn-out knee parts

758
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,800
You can hold it and move it around
to see how it works

759
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,600
PIease help us

760
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,600
He has no joy, not with me,
nor with my child<i>...</i> PIease

761
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
We'll operate on him
so he can walk again without pain

762
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,500
OId hiker

763
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,500
To what do I owe this honour?

764
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,300
Now you're doing business
with Hartmut<i>...</i>

765
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,900
-After all, you are my brother
-I see

766
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,600
-Anton, that can't be the reason
-No

767
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,800
I wanted to invite you
to a little family celebration

768
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:27,900
A nice meal,
some good wine, a friendly chat

769
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:29,900
Hermann, the kids<i>...</i>

770
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,600
-What are you celebrating?
-Maybe you've already heard

771
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:39,000
We have a new
Iittle grandchild<i>...</i> the first boy

772
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:43,400
-Take a look at the future
-He even resembles you

773
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,800
That puts you back on top,
doesn't it?

774
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:52,000
Immortality through reproduction,
Be fruitful and multiply

775
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,700
-Well done
-Ernst<i>...</i>

776
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:58,100
You live here all alone with
no family, That's no way to live

777
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,300
We were kids once

778
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,200
And suddenly, you remember
your brother, Something's up

779
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:09,800
Let's bury the hatchet,
We're not getting any younger

780
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,500
Each of us has to deal with that
in our own way, You're doing well

781
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:16,700
Isn't that enough?

782
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,400
I can't imagine that
you lack something I could give you

783
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:27,100
-Ernst, possessions aren't everything
-You of all people say that?

784
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:16,400
<i>He puts his herd out to pasture</i>

785
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:22,400
<i>A good shepherd</i>

786
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:27,900
<i>And he gathers his lambs</i>

787
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,500
<i>In his arms</i>

788
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,900
<i>In his arms</i>

789
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,600
Matthias Paul Anton<i>...</i>

790
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,300
<i>...</i>I baptise you
in the name of the Father<i>...</i>

791
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:51,400
<i>...</i>the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen

792
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,200
He should have said<i>...</i>

793
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,800
<i>...</i>in the name of the grandfather,
the great-grandfather<i>...</i>

794
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,100
-Rudi!
-It's true

795
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,700
Don't say such things

796
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,400
Peace be with you

797
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,200
Mr Böckle

798
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:45,900
What a surprise

799
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,500
-To what do I owe this honour?
-Mr Simon<i>...</i>

800
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,500
I wouldn't miss it<i>...</i>

801
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,800
<i>...</i>when one of my most important
business partners becomes a father

802
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:58,500
-Congratulations
-Thanks

803
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,400
-Here
-For my wife?

804
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,200
No, only for you

805
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:05,900
Mr Böckle, it's only you who remembered,
Let's drink to that

806
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:10,100
Here he is<i>...</i> Matthias Paul Anton

807
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,800
Hermann, CIarissa,
I would like you to meet someone

808
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,700
Mrs Lichtblau, Mr Böckle, Mr Simon

809
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:30,500
Hello, Don't I know you
from somewhere?

810
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,100
Didn't we meet on the train?

811
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,600
What a coincidence,
You know each other?

812
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:39,100
-You wanted to show me the bath
-We'll go on ahead

813
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,200
I'm afraid I told you a few lies

814
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:52,300
It's my hobby to tell strangers
the most incredible horror stories

815
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,800
Are you angry with me?

816
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:58,000
Anyway, it's nice to see you again
at such a happy event

817
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,900
Yes, it is

818
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:14,200
Hartmut,
could I talk to you a bit later?

819
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,900
Yes, You're sitting
back there, by the way

820
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:20,500
-Fine, I'll talk to you later
-OK, see you later

821
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,200
CIarissa, listen

822
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:28,100
I told you about my rail journey
to Leipzig with the strange man

823
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,800
That's him

824
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:33,000
Mr Böckle,
may I ask you to sit here?

825
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,700
I'll have them bring you
a place setting, See you later

826
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,300
Bring that man
a place setting, please

827
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:55,900
Dear citizens of Schabbach<i>...</i>

828
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,900
<i>...</i>colleagues, employees<i>...</i>

829
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,600
<i>...</i>Regional President, Mayor, Toni

830
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,400
I would like to announce something<i>...</i>

831
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:14,400
<i>...</i>that I spontaneously
decided this afternoon

832
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,100
This child here<i>...</i>

833
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:22,100
Mara, bring him up to the stage

834
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,200
A fanfare for the mother

835
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,900
At the age of forty-three

836
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:38,300
That's quite an achievement,
Mara, and we all admire you

837
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,500
Hartmut, you must agree

838
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,500
Nobody was expecting it -
Ieast of all you

839
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:53,700
This child is the first boy
among my grandchildren

840
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,900
The fact that I'm delighted<i>...</i>

841
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,900
<i>...</i>is something
you can all understand

842
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,600
But he is not only my grandchild

843
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:11,300
He is the guarantee that Schabbach
and the company will live on

844
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,800
We are entering
the third millennium<i>...</i> Fanfare

845
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:26,500
Would the notary come up on stage?
Bring the document with you

846
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:31,300
You all know Mr Weber,
the notary from Simmern

847
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:36,800
He will read you excerpts
from a document<i>...</i>

848
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,500
<i>...</i>which he drew up on my behalf

849
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:45,700
You can leave out
all the official blah-blah, Mr Weber

850
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:52,600
''I herewith transfer

01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:28,300
''<i>...</i>plus the capital transfer tax''

-This act<i>...</i>

863
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,100
You're astonished

864
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,800
No one<i>...</i>

865
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,900
<i>...</i>not even the parents or myself<i>...</i>

866
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:54,700
<i>...</i>can contest the child's wealth

867
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:03,800
This is now the richest baby
in the Rhineland-Palatinate

868
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,900
Fanfare

869
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,900

01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,400
<i>...</i>he will continue to control
the Simons' firm in Schabbach

874
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:44,100
<i>There, there, little goose</i>
<i>It's all better now ...</i>

875
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:51,000
-That's cruel
-Hartmut has four siblings

876
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:53,600
There are
five other grandchildren

877
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,900
What? So, are our children
Iess valuable?

878
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:03,100
-I don't believe it
-Let's wait and see

879
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,300
We'll see about this!

880
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:12,100
Hanna, Katharina, come on,
We're going

881
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,600
You can't do this to us,
Come on, Hans, Let's go

882
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
You're right

883
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,500
Did you know?

884
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,300
He's always against Hartmut,
Do you know why?

885
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:35,700
I want nothing to do with all of this,
Let's go, come on

886
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:52,700
-Let go of me
-Everything all right, Anton?

887
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,800
I forbid anyone from interfering!

888
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,900
You can go,
I would like to say something

889
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,300
-I'll send the document by post
-Right

890
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,200
I'm just as surprised as you are

891
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,800
But there is something
you should know

892
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:23,100
No matter what contradictions
there are in this family<i>...</i>

893
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,700
<i>...</i>there is one thing
I promise you<i>...</i>

894
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,100
We're experiencing an upswing

895
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:34,400
You're all familiar with
the new manufacturing plant at Hahn

896
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:41,100
I founded that company on my own,
without the old man

897
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,700
Let him do
what he wants with his savings

898
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,500
The main thing is
that the company must continue

899
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,600
As a limited partner,
I'm going to take my share from him

900
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:59,700
Even if I have to go
to the German Supreme Court

901
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:04,400
The battlefield isn't here,
It's in the market

902
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,200
I got contracts at the
Spring Trade Fair in Leipzig<i>...</i>

903
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,300
<i>...</i>worth several million

904
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,900
And if you turn around now
you'll see the man<i>...</i>

905
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:22,400
<i>...</i>to whom we will be grateful -
very grateful - in the future

906
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:24,100
Mr Böckle

907
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,500
Mr Böckle?

908
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:03,200
Is the little one asleep?

909
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:07,600
Don't worry about him,
You have to breathe deeply

910
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,000
Very deeply, Keep breathing

911
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:14,000
I have to tell you something, Mara

912
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,700
When Hartmut first
brought you home with him<i>...</i>

913
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,500
<i>...</i>I thought, ''Good heavens

914
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,100
''Is that woman with her
super-expensive love of horses<i>...</i>

915
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,400
''<i>...</i>supposed to become
my daughter-in-Iaw?''

916
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,400
I thought you were dreadful

917
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,300
I am the way I am

918
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:39,700
Then you know what I mean,
I am the way I am, too

919
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:47,900
No hospitals, Doctor,
None of that fuss

920
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,000
People die there

921
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:55,200
Give me a shot like you did
Iast time, lt really helped

922
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:59,100
-It's good you're here, Doctor
-You fell down, did you?

923
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:03,400
-I believe your daughter-in-Iaw
-You really were unconscious

924
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:07,500
Don't joke, I'm never unconscious,
Isn't that right, Hanni?

925
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:08,700
Yes, that's right

926
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:02,400
You can unpack the car,
I'll see if they are in

927
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,100
Hermann

928
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:26,900
-Lulu
-Aren't Hermann and CIarissa here?

929
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:28,800
Moni

930
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,100
We're just here because Tillmann
and I are looking after the house

931
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,700
Mr Simon and Mrs Lichtblau
couldn't cancel the concert in Bonn

932
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,800
-They tried everything, but<i>...</i>
-There were VIPs, so they had to go

933
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,900
But they are coming back
tonight, aren't they?

934
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:47,600
-Not before 1 :00am
-Pity

935
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,100
I wanted to celebrate with Hermann,
Can I leave a message?

936
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,500
Of course

937
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,800
OK, I've been a qualified engineer
for exactly four hours

938
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:59,500
I got a good mark, and we have
reserved a table at the Römerhof

939
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,100
If they get home early,
tell them to call in

940
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,900
Qualified engineer, four hours,
good mark, they can stop by

941
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,700
And we want to stay the night

942
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,600
For some time, I've observed
your increased desire for proteins

943
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:27,100
Ham, beef steak, raw meat

944
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:33,300
Increased desire for you,
What's the disease called?

945
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:39,500
<i>''Voluptio graviditi vulgaris. ''</i>
It's curable

946
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,600
Shame that a kid
can't have two dads

947
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:52,300
For you, our Asian plate
with spring rolls and jumbo shrimp

948
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:55,200
You were sad when
Lutz and I got together?

949
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:57,800
It's nothing new for me

950
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,500
I always cling to couples

951
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:05,100
I must have some kind of defect

952
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:11,100
To your diplomas

953
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:14,900
To yours

954
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:19,900
Enjoy your meal

955
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,900
-Delicious proteins
-You voracious beast

956
01:36:55,300 --> 01:37:00,500
<i>I'm going to the green garden</i>

957
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:04,500
<i>Marousya, one, two, three</i>
<i>Guelder berries, black</i>

958
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,700
<i>My girl in the garden</i>
<i>Picking berries in the garden</i>

959
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
<i>Marousya, one, two, three</i>
<i>Guelder berries, black</i>

960
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,000
<i>My girl in the garden</i>
<i>Picking berries in the garden</i>

961
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:22,100
Come on, time for bed,
Come with me

962
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,500
<i>Marousya, one, two...</i>

963
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:30,900
Galina

964
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,400
Say goodnight to Niko,
He wants to sleep now

965
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:40,500
Going to bed? Goodnight,
Go with your granny

966
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,900
Why are you standing about?

967
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,100
You can dance well

968
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,700
They repaired you well

969
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,300
Let's drink to that!

970
01:37:57,100 --> 01:38:02,200
-Mechanics<i>...</i> fantastic
-Maybe I've put on weight

971
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:07,400
-Have you been home long?
-Yes, five hours

972
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:09,200
-Really?
-Really

973
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,600
-Gala, look at the time
-I know

974
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:14,300
I wanted to be here earlier,
but I couldn't

975
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,400
What kind of job is that?
Night shift?

976
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:23,000
Late shift, When the boss says so,
we all have to work at night

977
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,700
-It's nice work, Yuri
-It's nice work for you

978
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,700
Your mother was with the baby,
cooking and cleaning

979
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,600
I had to serve the company's guests

980
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,900
What do you serve guests at night?

981
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,300
-Well<i>...</i> lenses
-What?

982
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,100
Simon contact lenses

983
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,500
Enough of that, Let's celebrate

984
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,500
How was it at the hospital?

985
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:53,800
The most important thing is sticking
to the regime and the exercises

986
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:56,500
Niko has gone off to sleep

987
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:00,800
Breakfast, then exercises<i>...</i>

988
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,000
<i>...</i>then lunch, very good food<i>...</i>

989
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:08,700
<i>...</i>then exercises,
exercises the whole day<i>...</i>

990
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,900
<i>...</i>then supper, very good food

991
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:14,900
These exercises are for me
to strengthen my shin

992
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,700
I asked the doctor if I could eat
meat with my dinner

993
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,700
He said, ''Vitamins, vitamins,
Vitamins morning and night''

994
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:28,100
What your <i>mamoushka</i> cooks
is still the best

995
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:31,300
Say yes, or you'll go back
to the clinic

996
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:32,600
Yes

997
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:36,600
Yuri, I can help you get
a very good job

998
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:39,500
Mr Simon said
there are three possibilities

999
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:43,700
Either manufacturing,
stockroom or deliveries

1000
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,000
And you can choose yourself, Good?

1001
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,800
The boss said that yesterday

1002
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:02,400
Why are you all looking at me?
What I say is true

1003
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:06,000
What kind of world is this
where a woman gets a man a job?

1004
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,400
Why is he joking about it? Why?

1005
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:11,000
Do you have to?

1006
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:21,100
How much do we owe
for the operation?

1007
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:26,700
-Nothing
-Have you already paid?

1008
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:10,700
Galina?

1009
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:13,200
Mr Hartmut

1010
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:18,100
So, how is Yuri's knee?

1011
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:23,500
He's home again, He's fine,
He laughs, dances and drinks

1012
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,000
That's great

1013
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,600
-I have to thank you
-Nonsense

1014
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:31,900
But you don't look very happy

1015
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,400
Damn family clan,
That's the problem, right?

1016
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:42,500
Yes, in our family it's better
to be a man than a woman

1017
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:47,300
Come with me

1018
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,400
Do you know what I think?

1019
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,700
It's all down to you and no one else

1020
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,800
Only the strongest wolf
in the pack has its say

1021
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,800
That's especially true in a family

1022
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,900
I've already taken up the fight

1023
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:32,700
I am a wolf, too

1024
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:45,000
Soon we'll be warm

1025
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:56,800
-Want to hear some music?
-Yes, please, Nice music

1026
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:12,500
Can you curtsy now?

1027
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:15,300
Yes, if you're a king

1028
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:18,300
I'm really someone else

1029
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,200
I am just what I am

1030
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,100
I am just what I am, too

1031
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,000
For me, you're a kind of princess

1032
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:37,900
But you have to take off your apron

1033
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,500
Lutz

1034
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:48,300
Give me the key,
You aren't driving home like that

1035
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:49,500
No

1036
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,700
-Why not?
-I called a taxi

1037
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,100
-I'm can drive, Give me the key
-Stop being silly

1038
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:58,100
Stop it, will you?
I've called a taxi, all right?

1039
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:02,500
We've both had a bit to drink,
so come on

1040
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,100
It's more comfortable

1041
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:09,400
They are for CIarissa

1042
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:47,900
Galina

1043
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:53,500
Galina

1044
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:06,000
Leave him alone,
Why are you getting involved?

1045
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:07,800
Why are you getting involved?

1046
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:11,900
Why are you standing there?

1047
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,700
What do you want? Get lost!

1048
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:28,100
Listen, don't tell me what to do,
Nobody tells me what to do

1049
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,400
Nobody! You understand?

1050
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:32,900
Rich swine!

1051
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:36,800
-What was that?
-You should be ashamed

1052
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:44,300
At last

1053
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:48,800
And don't ever come back

1054
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:51,000
We never want to see you again

1055
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:54,100
Take me away from here, fast

1056
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:06,700
Gala!

1057
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:38,600
-Are you all right?
-Yes

1058
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:41,400
-Lutz?
-That was a close shave

1059
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:45,000
Lutz?

1060
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:48,900
What an idiot!

1061
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:20,200
-You're out of your mind!
-Hey, you're bleeding

1062
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,800
Help us!

1063
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,700
Come on, Lutz!

1064
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,300
Anything? Nothing?
Move away, Get away

1065
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:44,800
Hartmut

1066
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:49,300
-It's you
-Lulu?

1067
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:07,400
Hello, police?
There's been an incident

1068
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:09,900
Hartmut Simon

1069
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:15,500
Main road between Hasselbach
and Hunsrückhöhen Road

1070
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:18,200
It's urgent, damn it!

1071
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,500
Yes

1072
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:24,200
Come on, Come on, Lutz

1073
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:35,300
The ambulance will take an hour,
but I can drive him to Simmern

1074
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:37,800
Yes, do that, Do it

1075
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,400
Help us carry him

1076
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:44,300
Watch his head

1077
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,700
Out of the way

1078
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,800
-That's from me
-I'll hurry

1079
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:18,300
Stop! I have to come with you,
Wait for me

1080
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:51,700
When the police come
we'll drive there right away

1081
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:23,500
Lulu

1082
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:15,300
