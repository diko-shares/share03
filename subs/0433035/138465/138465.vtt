3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:07,518
Well, I'm off.
Watch the kids, feed the kids,

4
00:00:07,552 --> 00:00:09,420
try not to kill the kids.

5
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:11,391
Got it.
Wait-- what was that last one?

6
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:14,529
Wow, look at
that outfit.

7
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:16,599
Never seen that before, huh?
Where are you off to--

8
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:18,602
a night out on the town
with your sister wives?

9
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:21,237
No, I'm going out
with Donald.

10
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,508
Yeah? Where's he's taking
you, a barn raising?

11
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,777
You going to churn
a little butter?

12
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:29,281
No one's butter is getting churned.
It's over with Donald.

13
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:31,718
Oh, I see.
So that's your dumping outfit.

14
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:33,720
Yep, this is defensive
dressing.

15
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:35,556
You don't bring out
the snack tray

16
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,559
unless you're going
to be serving dinner.

17
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:39,362
I don't want to get
the guy's hopes up.

18
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:42,566
I don't think you'd turn on
a pilgrim in that outfit.

19
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:45,471
So why is your relationship with
Donald coming to such a hasty end?

20
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,441
We never really clicked.
Donald's a good guy and everything,

21
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:50,410
but I just wasn't
feeling it.

22
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:54,415
Nor do I intend to feel it, which makes
it a lot easier to give him the heave-ho.

23
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:55,816
I'm curious-- when you
break up with a guy,

24
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,718
do you go in with a script
or do you just wing it?

25
00:00:57,752 --> 00:01:00,788
No, tightly scripted.
The goal is to be brief and merciful.

26
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:04,525
- Professional.
- So like a mob hit.

27
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:07,361
Exactly. It's the least I can do.
The guy is taking me to dinner.

28
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:09,663
Wait a minute-- you're whacking the
guy and you're still going to eat?

29
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:13,335
I'm not completely heartless!
I'll take it to-go.

30
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:15,571
Anything that travels well:

31
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:18,808
Risotto, pasta, Cobb salad--
dressing on the side.

32
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:21,344
Wait a minute.
You know what? I actually

33
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,814
still see a little bit of skin here.
Hold on a minute.

34
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:25,682
Let me just--

35
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:31,356
there you go!

36
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,658
I would break up
with you so hard.

37
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,460
Oh!

Ooh, but it doesn't
travel well.

46

From the kitchen to the table.
Look how far away that is.

47
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:02,457
- Good evening, are you ready to--
- Risotto!

48
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:04,759
- Donald?
- Uh, I don't know.

49
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:07,328
Um, I guess
I'll have that too.

50
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:09,531
No!

51
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,501
- Well, yeah okay.
- Very good.

52
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:14,803
May I interest you in a
chocolate souffle for dessert?

53
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:17,473
- I love souffle.
- We ask you to order it now,

54
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,575
- as it takes 40 minutes to prepare.
- Ooh, 40?

55
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,778
Yeah, there's no way
I'll still be-- hee hee--

56
00:02:21,812 --> 00:02:24,648
hungry.

57
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:27,519
So, Donald,

58
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:29,454
there's something
I need to tell you.

59
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:31,490
Okay, but there's something
I need to tell you first.

60
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:34,560
Good idea. Mine might be
kinda tough to follow.

61
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:36,529
I was fired this morning.

62
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:39,632
10 years of loyal service
and they kick me to the curb.

63
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,634
Oh wow, I'm sorry.

64
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:44,537
When one door closes,
another one opens.

65
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:47,273
And then another one closes.

66
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:49,942
This has been one
of the worst days ever.

67
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:52,912
I almost canceled our date
tonight, but then I realized

68
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:55,048
I've still got one
good thing left in my life.

69
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:57,150
Oh, what's that?

70
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:59,220
Oh, me?!

71
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:01,255
I don't know what I'd do
without you, Mel.

72
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,291
Your smile is like sunlight

73
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:06,227
breaking through
the clouds of my despair.

74
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:10,098
So what was it
you wanted to tell me?

75
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:14,236
I can't break up with him now.
He's got the confidence of pudding!

76
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,839
I have to wait till he's
back on his feet,

77
00:03:16,873 --> 00:03:19,875
- finds another job.
- Finds another job, in this economy?

78
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:24,079
- I hope you like pudding.
- No, I like a man I can chew.

79
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:28,050
- We've got to find him another job
- I'm sorry-- "we"?

80
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:30,953
You're right-- you!
You've got to find him another job.

81
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:33,889
C'mon, I've heard you brag about
all the executives you hired

82
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:36,091
back when you ran America.
You can do this.

83
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,993
Okay, now I know you're desperate,
because you're flattering me.

84
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:42,196
With the truth!
You know what executives are looking for.

85
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:45,300
Donald's been in the same job forever.
You'll know how to sell himself.

86
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:49,970
but you are Joe Longo,
the zen master of business.

87
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:51,972
You know, you're not
the first person to say that.

88
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:54,074
I know.
I've heard you say it.

89
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,044
- So you'll do it?
- Yes.

90
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:58,345
Greatness calls.

91
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,981
Thank you! Oh, but you've
got to do it quick,

92
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:03,116
because I don't want to extend
myself in other areas

93
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:05,852
to keep this relationship going,
if you know what I mean.

94
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:07,153
My charity
only goes so far.

95
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:09,189
- I don't want to lay it all out--
- I get it!

96
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:14,094
<i>( Doorbell rings )</i>

97
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:16,063
Hello, Lennox.

98
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:17,931
Hey, Holly,
let me get Ryder for you.

99
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,233
Actually I'd like
to speak to you--

100
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:23,036
- in private.
- Uh...

101
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,839
Okay, let's do it outside
where there's daylight...

102
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:27,307
And witnesses.

103
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:33,279
This past Saturday I attended
Dennis Kitson's birthday party.

104
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:37,083
While at said party a most
terrible thing happened.

105
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:39,918
Someone couldn't
get to the point?

106
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:42,120
I accidentally kissed
a boy who wasn't Ryder.

107
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:45,923
Accidentally? What, you tripped and
your tongue fell in his mouth?

108
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:49,893
How exactly did
this mishap occur?

109
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:54,932
Well, at the party, I was complaining
about a very unsightly pimple

110
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:58,102
which had come to dominate
my life. And my forehead.

111
00:04:58,137 --> 00:05:00,905
Tim Logan heard me
complaining about it

112
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,042
and said, "yo,
I don't see any zit."

113
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:05,845
That "yo" was such
a confidence-booster

114
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,081
that the next thing I knew,
our lips were entwined.

115
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:11,918
But Ryder is your boyfriend!
How could you do that to my little brother?

116
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:13,953
I know, I know,
I feel awful.

117
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:16,923
I came to you because
you know him best.

118
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:19,125
- What should I do?
- You have to tell Ryder.

119
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,895
Darn.
I was hoping you'd say,

120
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:24,297
"we all make mistakes,
just move on."

121
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:26,099
If you don't
tell him, I will.

122
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:27,867
No no no,
please don't, don't.

123
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:30,970
Look, I'll do it,
I swear.

124
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:33,273
All right, all right,
I won't say anything,

125
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:35,175
but don't make me
regret this.

126
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,144
Oh, Lennox,
you're a true friend.

127
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:40,013
Okay, that's enough.

128
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,949
I know how much you like to
accidentally make out with people.

129
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:48,989
Okay, so your resume's
looking a lot better,

130
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:51,925
but the most important thing is how you're
going to perform in the job interview.

131
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,894
So let's say the guy asks you
what your greatest strength is.

132
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:57,197
- What do you say?
- I don't know...

133
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,033
- Loyalty?
- All right, what's your greatest weakness?

134
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,102
I have a tiny bladder.

135
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:05,272
Here's a tip: Don't ever
use the word "bladder"

136
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:07,808
in a job interview.

137
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:10,844
Oh God, no one's
gonna want to hire me.

138
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,980
Come on, man. You gotta
work on your confidence.

139
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:15,983
You gotta make 'em want you.
You don't take no for an answer.

140
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:19,987
Excuse me. Can I borrow
your newspaper for a sec?

141
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:23,123
Sure. I'm only looking at the want ads anyway.
I'm unemployed.

142
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:26,092
- Here you go.
- Wait wait wait.

143
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:29,028
Actually I'm not sure if we want
to part with this newspaper here.

144
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:31,030
Please?
There isn't any WiFi in here

145
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:34,000
and I really want to check out the
movie times for "Slaughterhouse."

146
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:35,968
"Slaughterhouse"?
That's a pretty scary movie.

147
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:37,136
You going to go see that
with your boyfriend?

148
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:40,006
No boyfriend, just me.

149
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,075
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't think I can let you do that.

150
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:46,011
I can't let you go see this
scary movie all by yourself.

151
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:49,214
What do you say I meet you
at the Orpheum tonight?

152
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:51,984
Wow, someone's pretty
sure of themselves.

153
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:55,188
Yeah, that would be me.
( Laughs )

154
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:57,890
Okay, I'll see you
tonight at 8:00.

155
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:00,025
- Okay.
- ( Both laugh )

156
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:04,097
Huh.
Think she'll really show up?

157
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,133
Yeah, man,
she's gonna show up.

158
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,837
See, what you just witnessed there,
Donald, was a lesson in confidence.

159
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:12,838
All right?
I didn't take no for an answer.

160
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:16,108
Matter of fact, I just sold her something
she didn't even know that she wanted.

161
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:19,812
You know what that was?
100% Joe Longo.

162
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:21,880
What are
you selling, Donald?

163
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:26,151
All this?

164
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:33,191
- Really got a lot of work to do.
- Yeah.

165
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:38,091
That smells good.
What is that?

166
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:39,929
It's my famous
butternut squash ravioli.

167
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:42,563
Oh? Is it
really famous, Joe?

168
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:43,931
Is it dating a supermodel?

169
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,831
Did it beat up paparazzi?

170
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,399
Was it on
"Dancing With The Stars"?

171
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,768
Finished higher
than you did.

172
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:52,636
<i>( Knocks )</i>

173
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:56,540
Hey, it's Donald.

174
00:07:56,574 --> 00:07:57,941
What?
Don't open it.

175
00:07:57,976 --> 00:07:59,977
He-- he sees me.

176
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,814
- Why is he here?
- If only there was a way we could find out.

177
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:06,918
Hey, Donald,
what's up, buddy?

178
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,788
Yes, what brings you here
so delightfully unannounced?

179
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,491
I wanted to tell you
I just had an interview

180
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,460
with Hartman-Glassberg
and it went great.

181
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,828
Really? So you might be employed soon?
'Cause that would be awesome.

182
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:20,831
- No, didn't get the job.
- Aw. I thought you said it went great.

183
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,834
It did. I made it all the way through
the interview without getting sick.

184
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:26,770
- Good for you!
- Until just now in your driveway.

185
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:30,540
Donald, remember how we talked
about not over-sharing?

186
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:33,476
- Keeping a little mystery?
- Right, right.

187
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:36,681
I didn't say where
in the driveway.

188
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:39,951
The sessions with you
are helping so much, Joe.

189
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:43,622
Even though I got shot down for the job,
I still had the confidence to come over here

190
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,791
and say,
"Hey, Mel Burke,

191
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,494
you and I are having
dinner tonight."

192
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,896
Oh, sorry, Donald.

193
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,866
You know, Joe made
his famous... uh...

194
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,868
Orange lumps.

195
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,771
Sorry, pretty lady, but I will
not take no for an answer.

196
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,606
( Chuckles )
No.

197
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,642
- ( Brightly ) Okay!
- Hey, don't back down.

198
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:04,545
( Clears throat )
Can I call you later?

199
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,748
- Don't use questions.
- I'm calling you later.

200
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:11,619
But right now
I have to-- y'know,

201
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:13,488
use the restroom.

202
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:15,823
For something really
mysterious.

203
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:19,927
What the hell
are you teaching him?

204
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,595
You might not want to tour the
factory, but I promise you

205
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,764
when the product hits the shelves,
you're gonna be impressed.

206
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:28,501
When will that be? I don't know how
much longer I can keep pity-dating him.

207
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,870
- He's getting handsy.
- Look, I'll bump him up to five sessions a week.

208
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,506
Next week he has two more of
those interviews and I think

209
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,940
one of those is going
to come through,

210
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,811
and then you will be able to break
that poor sucker's heart guilt-free.

211
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,514
- I like the sound of that.
- Yeah you do.

212
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,818
Boy, it's been a while
since I've seen you.

213
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:46,753
Has it?
It's only been five sessions.

214
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:48,856
I mean a-- a week.

215
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,925
So Joe says that you've
had some interviews

216
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,794
and you might have
a job offer?

217
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:55,563
- I wouldn't say that.
- Oh.

218
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:58,933
- I got two job offers.
- Oh, thank God! That's great news.

219
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:02,570
I mean for you too.
Uh-- for you mainly!

220
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:04,939
Suddenly I am in demand.
I'm a whole new Donald.

221
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,941
My life is starting
a new chapter.

222
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,610
Speaking of new chapters
and fresh starts,

223
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:10,978
I think we should
talk about us.

224
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,980
Um, look, in every relationship,
there comes a time--

225
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:15,949
- Are you folks ready to order?
- Oh yes.

226
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:18,851
I don't see it here, but I'd
love the steak sandwich.

227
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,954
I'm sorry, we only serve the
steak sandwich at lunch.

228
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,988
Ohhh, that's too bad.

229
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,557
It's just so easy to eat
while you're driving...

230
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,726
To dessert-town.

231
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,827
Do me a favor: Could you
send the manager over?

232
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,862
- Thank you.
- Oh, you don't have to do that.

233
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,565
- Mel, I got this.
- No, it's okay, I'll just settle for something else.

234
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,702
I don't think a woman like you
should ever settle for anything.

235
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,972
Good evening.
May I help you?

236
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:43,608
I hope so.
( Clears throat )

237
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:46,611
My dinner companion has her heart
set on your steak sandwich.

238
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:49,681
- <i>And I would like</i> <i>for her to have it.
</i> <i>- I'm sorry, sir,</i>

239
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,717
- that's a lunch item.
- I understand it usually is.

240
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:54,985
But you have the steak,
you have the bread.

241
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,822
I'm sure the technology
exists to...

242
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,792
So could you
make that happen

243
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,927
as a personal favor
for the lovely lady and me?

244
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:04,929
I believe I can
make that work, sir.

245
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:07,765
All right, I knew you
were the man for the job.

246
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:11,803
Wow, that was amazing the way
you mind-controlled him.

247
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,771
You're like
the steak sandwich Jedi.

248
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,607
Mel, the key to getting
what you want

249
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:20,545
is never take no
for an answer.

250
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,581
So what was it you were going
to say about fresh starts?

251
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:27,685
I think we ought
to have one right now.

252
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:42,532
- Joe, I need your help.
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

253
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:45,001
- Holly cheated on Ryder.
- Wow, what did she do--

254
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:47,870
she whip some other boy
behind his back?

255
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:49,972
No, she made out with
another guy at a party.

256
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:52,974
And she was supposed to fess up like a
week ago but she hasn't done it yet

257
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:54,876
and someone needs
to tell Ryder the truth.

258
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,945
Well, yeah.
Why aren't you that someone?

259
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:01,684
Please?
I don't have the heart.

260
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:03,619
And you're so good
at everything.

261
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:05,921
Only everything
I've ever tried.

262
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:08,757
All right, fine.

263
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,829
Hey, buddy. So just making a
little idle chit-chat here.

264
00:12:12,863 --> 00:12:14,664
How are things going
with you and Holly?

265
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,900
- Great. Couldn't be better.
- Is that right?

266
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:19,536
Yeah, I mean,
in the past

267
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,672
she may have been
a tad bit controlling--

268
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,742
you do know what
"a tad" is, right?

269
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,978
Yeah, a baby frog.

270
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,514
Anyway...

271
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:34,887
Yesterday she let me blow
my nose in front of her.

272
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,623
That's a big step
for you guys.

273
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,727
- So you're happy?
- Couldn't be happier.

274
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:44,631
Oh, all right.
Well, it's good, it's good.

275
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:45,965
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

276
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,668
He's in a happy relationship.
You know how rare that is?

277
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,870
You have to.
He needs to know.

278
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,707
I mean, just look at him!
Sad and clueless,

279
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,676
- drinking his milk.
- Ahhhh.

280
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:59,945
( Mouths word )

281
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,715
Hey, Ryder, so, um,

282
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,718
you know...
Sometimes, you know,

283
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,687
when you're going out
with a girl,

284
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,822
you-- you think that
she's one way,

285
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:15,659
but in all actuality,
she's really another.

286
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,595
Joe, what are you saying?

287
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,530
Holly cheated
on you, bud.

288
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:23,535
Oh yeah, I know.
She made out with Tim Logan at that party.

289
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,706
- Wait, you knew?
- How clueless do you think I am?

290
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,811
- Why didn't you tell Holly that you knew?
- Why would I?

291
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:33,680
It's been the best
two weeks of my life.

292
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:37,684
Tomorrow, she's baking me a pie.
I love pie.

293
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:40,887
- Aren't you upset?
- I was at first.

294
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,589
But then she started
acting so sweet.

295
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:45,658
It's obvious that she
feels bad about what she did.

296
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,559
Why make her feel worse?

297
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,561
So you're just going to let her
suffer with her own guilt?

298
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,564
It's pie, man.

299
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,733
Boysenberry.
I didn't even know that existed!

300
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:59,637
Look, if you're lucky enough
to find someone great,

301
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,472
you do what you can
to hold on to them.

302
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:03,540
You are absolutely right
about that, Ryder.

303
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:04,908
People are always throwing
away their relationships,

304
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:06,677
but I say
you've gotta work on it.

305
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:09,513
I'm pretty sure I've never
heard you say that.

306
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,749
- Well, now I do.
- Well, if you'll excuse me,

307
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,885
I've gotta go upstairs
and Skype with my woman.

308
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:18,589
She's gonna do my math homework for
me, then watch me fall asleep.

309
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:22,493
There really is somebody
for everyone.

310
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:25,497
What's up with you and this whole
new sunny outlook on relationships?

311
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,798
Weren't you just out
dumping Donald?

312
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,767
No. I saw something
in Donald tonight

313
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,703
that I hadn't
really seen before.

314
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,672
Oh yeah?
What was that?

315
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,974
He was different. He was cool.
He was self-assured.

316
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:38,644
I can't really explain it,
but he was just so--

317
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,814
- Me?
- No, he was nothing like you.

318
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,650
I liked him. He was take-charge.
He was confident.

319
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:45,751
Yeah? You know why
he was confident?

320
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,985
Because I taught him
to be confident.

321
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,721
No, he was confident

322
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,656
because of all the job
offers he's been getting.

323
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,758
- Why do you think he's getting all these job offers?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

324
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:55,828
Were you in the interviews with him
with your hand up his puppet-hole?

325
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,898
He's been getting the job offers because
I put him through a crash course

326
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:01,768
- at the University of Southern Longo.
- Oh really?

327
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:05,805
What's your school cheer?
"We are full of crap!"

328
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,810
All right, you know what?
I will prove it to you.

329
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:11,812
Give me an example
of confident Donald.

330
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:14,748
Okay, tonight at dinner
I wanted the steak sandwich,

331
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:16,949
but the waiter said that that's
a lunch item, so Donald--

332
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:20,720
called for the manager and gave him the
"what my woman wants, she gets" speech.

333
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,557
- How'd you know that?
- It's my speech!

334
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:26,492
I taught him that speech.
You're going out with a guy that I trained.

335
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,662
He's using all my moves.
Face it, Burke--

336
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:31,932
you are dating Joe Longo.

337
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:35,903
No.
You-- it's--

338
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:37,805
- You--
- Exactly.

339
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,542
Me.
Me!

340
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:49,604
Hey.

341
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:52,974
Somebody order
a Donald, straight up?

342
00:15:53,008 --> 00:15:55,576
- Hey you.
- Ready for dinner?

343
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,545
Almost.

344
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:02,300
- Are you ready now?
- Uh-huh.

345
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:04,635
I'm taking you to
a great Thai restaurant.

346
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,372
Oh, I was really
craving Chinese.

347
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:10,442
- Mmm, I think you'll change your mind.
- I don't think I will.

348
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:14,313
- I'm betting you'll come around.
- Wow, you have such an ego.

349
00:16:14,347 --> 00:16:17,349
- And it works for me, doesn't it?
- I can't stand it.

350
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:23,489
- So Thai it is?
- Oh yeah.

351
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:26,258
Oh, sorry to interrupt,
Ms. Burke,

352
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:27,559
but the city attorney
is on the phone.

353
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:29,661
- Oh, tell him I'm busy making out.
- Okay.

354
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:32,264
No, I was just kidding!
Put him through.

355
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:34,366
I'll be out there
when you're ready.

356
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:38,237
Save some of those
for after dinner.

357
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:42,409
How do you type so fast?
You must have magic fingers.

358
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:45,613
No, I think they're just
regular fingers.

359
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:49,249
Well, they are the prettiest
regular fingers I've ever seen.

360
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:50,550
You could be
a hand model.

361
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:52,519
- Donald?
- Yeah.

362
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:55,655
- You ready?
- Yeah, what was that?

363
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,624
Just making
a lady smile.

364
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:01,161
Now let's go see
if I can make you smile.

365
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,237
( Dramatic music plays,
screaming on TV )

366
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:15,209
I'm so glad you wanted to watch
"Zombie Academy 4: Senior Year."

367
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,412
I didn't think you were
into these kind of movies.

368
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:19,581
I like whatever
you like, sweetie.

369
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
<i>( Chainsaw whirrs )</i>

370
00:17:21,615 --> 00:17:22,651
Whoa!

371
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:26,222
No more torso
for that guy.

372
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:27,685
Oh my!

373
00:17:27,686 --> 00:17:28,891
So Ryder, uhm...

374
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:32,627
If you want, you can keep watching the
movie and I'll massage your feet.

375
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:35,463
Socks or no socks?

376
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:41,268
No socks, if that's
what you'd like.

377
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:44,238
Holly, you're the best.

378
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,207
Oh, um,
I'm not that great.

379
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:50,578
Are you kidding? You're the greatest
girlfriend a guy's ever had.

380
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,347
No no, Ryder.
I'm not!

381
00:17:53,382 --> 00:17:55,282
I can't take this any more.

382
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:57,385
I have a terrible
confession to make:

383
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,190
I have kissed the lips
of another.

384
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:05,328
What?!
No, Holly, that cannot be true!

385
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:08,231
You could never
have kissed Tim Logan!

386
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:12,268
Who said Tim Logan?

387
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:14,470
No one.
I just took a shot,

388
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:17,207
'cause, you know,
he's so cute.

389
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:19,409
You knew!

390
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:21,411
You knew this whole time!
( Gasps )

391
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:24,214
And you let me
be nice to you!

392
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:26,350
- I'm sorry--
- Lennox!

393
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:29,353
- You told Ryder? You swore you wouldn't!
- What?

394
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:32,623
- I didn't say squat.
- I massaged his naked foot for nothing!

395
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:35,594
Tell him how wrong it was to
exploit an innocent girl.

396
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:38,664
Innocent? You tried to
inhale Tim Logan's face.

397
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:42,468
Hey, watch what you say.
That's my girlfriend you're talking to.

398
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:46,272
You're defending her?
Wow, you two deserve each other.

399
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:48,608
I now pronounce you
Mr. and Mrs. whack-job.

400
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:54,413
Oh, you are in so much
trouble, mister.

401
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:56,282
Now put your sock back on.

402
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:06,157
- Hey.
- Hey.

403
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:09,227
That was a quick date.
Man, you're easy.

404
00:19:09,262 --> 00:19:11,529
I pulled the trigger.
I dumped Donald.

405
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:14,366
You dumped him?
What happened to working things out?

406
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,401
You can't work things out
with an egomaniac.

407
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:18,570
He was horrible,
smug, arrogant.

408
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:21,339
You're right, Joe.
He is you.

409
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:23,475
Wait a minute, I thought you
said that he wasn't me.

410
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,378
That was before
you assified him.

411
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:28,481
At dinner,
Donald told me

412
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:30,182
he was tied down to one
company for 10 years--

413
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:31,784
he won't be tied down
to one lady.

414
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:35,355
He actually said, "we can see each other
as long as you know I'm freelance."

415
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:38,257
- Freelance!
- What?

416
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,559
I hardly ever say that...

417
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:41,661
Anymore.

418
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,198
Wow, I gave him all that confidence
and he just took it to the dark side.

419
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:47,333
He was flirting with everyone:
The receptionist,

420
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:49,469
the waitress, the effeminate
valet parking guy.

421
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:52,673
You ruined him, Joe, and what could have
been a perfectly good relationship.

422
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:56,509
Poor Donald... With great power
comes great responsibility.

423
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,579
I guess I just brought
him along too quickly.

424
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:01,314
Oh well,
you're welcome.

425
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:04,584
- For what?
- For what? A few weeks ago,

426
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:08,487
a lady came to me and said,
"Joe, zen master, miracle worker,"

427
00:20:08,522 --> 00:20:11,356
will you please help me get
Donald a job so I can dump him?"

428
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,692
And two weeks later, Donald got
a job and you got to dump him.

429
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:17,629
- Miracle accomplished.
- Oh, so that was your plan all along?

430
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,564
Burke, the point
isn't how we got here.

431
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:21,699
All right?
It's that we've arrived.

432
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:25,369
Okay, must you turn everything into
a reason for self-celebration?

433
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:29,306
I'm just saying that one day maybe
you'll start doing everything right,

434
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:31,609
and then you'll know what
it's like to be in my world.

435
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:35,413
What's in your
dumping doggy box there?

436
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:37,549
- Chicken Satay.
- Ooh, that looks good.

437
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,452
You want some?
Dump your own guy!

438
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:46,569
 Hey, Joe.

439
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:48,669
I need your help
and I can't talk to Aunt Mel.

440
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,668
I get it--
guy stuff, huh?

441
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:54,171
Sit down.
What's up?

442
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:56,974
Teach me
how to bake a pie.

443
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:59,143
Holly found out
you knew, didn't she?

444
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:01,278
Yep.

445
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:04,247
So no more her doing your
homework, no more massages?

446
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:07,250
No more a lot of things.

447
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:09,921
And order is restored.

448
00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:13,223
All right, buddy.
Time to man up, dude.

449
00:21:13,257 --> 00:21:14,792
Put on your apron.

450
