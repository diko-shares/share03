00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:31.216
<i>My life fades</i>

2
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.718
<i>the vision dims.</i>

3
00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.389
<i>All that remains are memories.</i>

4
00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:42.435
<i>I remember a time of chaos</i>

5
00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:46.898
<i>ruined dreams, this wasted land.</i>

6
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:52.112
<i>But most of all,
I remember the Road Warrior</i>

7
00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.156
<i>the man we called Max.</i>

8
00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:59.995
<i>To understand who he was,
you have to go back to another time</i>

9
00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.832
<i>when the world was powered
by the black fuel,</i>

10
00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:08.628
<i>and the deserts sprouted
great cities of pipe and steel.</i>

11
00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:13.800
<i>Gone now, swept away.</i>

12
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:18.930
<i>For reasons long forgotten,
two mighty warrior tribes went to war,</i>

13
00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:22.600
<i>and touched off a blaze
which engulfed them all.</i>

14
00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:27.272
<i>Without fuel they were nothing.
They'd built a house of straw.</i>

15
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.318
<i>The thundering machines
sputtered and stopped.</i>

16
00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:38.700
<i>Their leaders talked
and talked and talked.</i>

17
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:44.539
<i>But nothing could stem the avalanche.</i>

18
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.625
<i>Their world crumbled</i>

19
00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.628
<i>the cities exploded.</i>

20
00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:53.340
<i>A whirlwind of looting</i>

21
00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.551
<i>a firestorm of fear.</i>

22
00:02:57.552 --> 00:03:00.055
<i>Men began to feed on men.</i>

23
00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:05.101
<i>On the roads,
it was a white-line nightmare.</i>

24
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.480
<i>Only those mobile enough to scavenge</i>

25
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.775
<i>brutal enough to pillage, would survive.</i>

26
00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.153
<i>The gangs took over the highways</i>

27
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.199
<i>ready to wage war for a tank of juice.</i>

28
00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:23.286
<i>And in this maelstrom of decay</i>

29
00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:26.623
<i>ordinary men were battered and smashed.</i>

30
00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:28.958
<i>Men like Max.</i>

31
00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.378
<i>The warrior Max.</i>

32
00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:37.509
<i>In the roar of an engine,
he lost everything...</i>

33
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.183
<i>and became a shell of a man.</i>

34
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.103
<i>A burnt-out, desolate man.</i>

35
00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:52.982
<i>A man haunted by the demons of his past.</i>

36
00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:57.529
<i>A man who wandered out
into the wasteland.</i>

37
00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.907
<i>And it was here</i>

38
00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.160
<i>in this blighted place</i>

39
00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.289
<i>that he learned to live again.</i>

40
00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:38.763
Don't hurt the snake. Put it down.

41
00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:42.433
Gently, gently. Nice. Nice.

42
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.101
Now the iron.

43
00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.564
The gun.

44
00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.819
Down, down. Turn around.

45
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.000
Looks like I got myself some
gasoline, eh?

46
00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:11.003
Eh? V8? Huh?

47
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.840
Booby-trapped.
Touch those tanks and:

48
00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:25.685
Booby trap. Back up.

49
00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:30.398
Oh, you crafty little man, you.

50
00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:33.401
You're quick, very quick.

51
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:38.656
Never seen a man beat the snake before.
Who are you?

52
00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:44.161
Reflexes. Yeah. That's what you've got.

53
00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:48.332
Me, I got brains.

54
00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:53.629
Hey!

55
00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:58.301
A fella, a quick fella

56
00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:03.139
might have a weapon under there.
I'd have to pin his head to the panel.

57
00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:17.695
Hey. Hey, hey.

58
00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:22.575
Don't play me the fool.

59
00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:32.919
Gas, fuel, gasoline!
Thousands of gallons of it!

60
00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:35.254
- As much as you want!
- Where? Where?

61
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:38.121
Twenty miles from here.
Pumping it, they are. Refining!

62
00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.136
- A huge tanker full.
- Crap.

63
00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.722
No. No, no, no, it's true! It's true.

64
00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:47.975
It's not self-service, no, no.
It's too hard for me.

65
00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:51.062
- But a man of your ingenuity...
- Where? Where? Where?

66
00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:54.565
Kill me and you'll never find out.

67
00:12:57.818 --> 00:12:58.903
All right. Come on.

68
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.546
Good dog. Nice doggy, eh?

69
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.007
Good doggy.

70
00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:27.932
Bless you, dog.

71
00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:55.001
Well, there it is.

72
00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.964
Four days I was up here

73
00:14:00.464 --> 00:14:04.468
me and the snakes,
playing mahjong, taking tea

74
00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.430
watching, thinking

75
00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:11.142
how was I gonna get in and get the gas?

76
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.396
Day and night it's pumping.

77
00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:20.151
Fuel to burn.

78
00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:24.864
They've got the lot.
Power, lights, you name it.

79
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.617
You can bet your life
they mean to keep it.

80
00:14:29.493 --> 00:14:31.287
Thirty of them in there.

81
00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:33.956
Arrows, flamethrowers, guns.

82
00:14:35.332 --> 00:14:38.044
No place for man or reptile, I thought.

83
00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:41.338
Then this trash arrived

84
00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:44.175
as moths to a flame.

85
00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:47.386
Round and round, attack, attack

86
00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:52.099
like angry ants,
mad with the smell of gasoline.

87
00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:11.160
In the tanker, that's where they keep it.

88
00:15:12.369 --> 00:15:15.206
Thousands of gallons.
As much as you want.

89
00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.544
If anyone's gonna get in there,
it's gonna be you.

90
00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:24.173
Me, I'm gonna feed the snakes.

91
00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:31.806
A man lives by his word, I reckon,
and I've kept mine, eh?

92
00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:44.276
Look, we had a deal. I show you the gas
and you let me go, right?

93
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.322
- The arrangement was I wouldn't kill you.
- After all I've done for you...

94
00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:51.450
I reckon you got a bargain, don't you?

95
00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:22.231
<i>Attack, my vermin, attack!</i>

96
00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:50.634
<i>Onward! Bring me the fuel.
For the glory of Humungus.</i>

97
00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:53.262
<i>For the great glory of Humungus.</i>

98
00:16:57.975 --> 00:17:00.102
<i>Smegma crazies to the left!</i>

99
00:17:03.063 --> 00:17:05.816
<i>The gate! Gayboy berserkers to the gate!</i>

100
00:17:12.948 --> 00:17:14.491
<i>I am your Lord.</i>

101
00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:20.706
<i>Attack!</i>

102
00:24:07.738 --> 00:24:10.741
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

103
00:24:10.907 --> 00:24:12.117
Save it.

104
00:24:12.576 --> 00:24:14.828
I'm just here for the gasoline.

105
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:16.288
Yeah. Yeah.

106
00:24:22.085 --> 00:24:23.879
As much as you like.

107
00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:26.006
Just take me back there.

108
00:25:12.928 --> 00:25:15.472
Show your weapons and come forward!

109
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.186
Steady now.

110
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.190
Take it real easy.

111
00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:28.360
That's as far as you go.

112
00:25:29.069 --> 00:25:30.487
Turn around.

113
00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:33.407
Nathan! Nathan! It's Nathan!

114
00:25:33.573 --> 00:25:34.866
Hurry, get the stretcher!

115
00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:36.284
Lose them.

116
00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:41.039
Open the gate.

117
00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:48.588
Hurry up with that damned stretcher.

118
00:25:49.005 --> 00:25:50.048
Nathan!

119
00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:53.176
Hey, that's fine.
It's fine. Just stay here.

120
00:25:53.677 --> 00:25:55.470
Cover him. Cover him.

121
00:25:57.848 --> 00:25:59.725
Come on, quick. Quick.

122
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.310
Oh, what a waste!

123
00:26:03.353 --> 00:26:05.021
Watch his leg.

124
00:26:08.024 --> 00:26:10.068
You and your handiwork!

125
00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:12.028
He didn't stand a chance!

126
00:26:12.195 --> 00:26:15.907
Oh, I warned him. You all heard me.
"Madness," I said.

127
00:26:16.158 --> 00:26:19.536
"We can escape, take our gas," he said.
"How?" I said.

128
00:26:19.703 --> 00:26:21.853
Get that machine inside.
Charlie, help me...

129
00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:23.206
Derek?

130
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.548
Get that machine inside.

131
00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:33.800
Close the damned gate.

132
00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:36.367
Mind your backs,
mind your backs. Coming through.

133
00:26:48.565 --> 00:26:50.942
All right, give him room, give him room.

134
00:26:54.488 --> 00:26:55.906
Who are you?

135
00:26:56.948 --> 00:26:59.075
How did you get through out there?

136
00:26:59.242 --> 00:27:02.162
Look, I want some answers.
Where did you find him?

137
00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:05.916
Two or three miles down the road,
left for dead. We had a deal.

138
00:27:06.082 --> 00:27:08.459
There were three other vehicles.
Did you see them?

139
00:27:08.543 --> 00:27:11.003
They're heading to the southwest
in heaps of trouble.

140
00:27:11.087 --> 00:27:13.673
He said if I brought him back,
you'd give me some gas.

141
00:27:13.757 --> 00:27:16.927
- Now, there's not much time.
- There was a woman in the car.

142
00:27:18.011 --> 00:27:19.387
She's dead.

143
00:27:21.097 --> 00:27:22.307
What did they do?

144
00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:25.324
It was quick. I just want my gas,
I wanna get out of here.

145
00:27:25.435 --> 00:27:27.895
For all we know, he's one of them.
Give him nothing.

146
00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:29.648
She's right, he's a parasite.

147
00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:32.692
Trading in human flesh. Mercenary trash.

148
00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.863
- We had an arrangement.
- What do you mean, an arrangement?

149
00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.782
You talk to this man.

150
00:27:39.574 --> 00:27:42.994
No, no. Try something. Try something.

151
00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:59.094
If you had a contract, it was with him.

152
00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:00.971
And it died with him.

153
00:28:01.137 --> 00:28:03.139
- Get rid of him.
- Move it.

154
00:28:03.473 --> 00:28:04.641
Left!

155
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:08.478
Left.

156
00:28:12.274 --> 00:28:15.569
Gotta hand it to you, treasure.
The last of the V8 Interceptors.

157
00:28:15.735 --> 00:28:17.445
A piece of history.

158
00:28:19.072 --> 00:28:21.366
Would have been a shame to blow it up.

159
00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:32.294
Let him go!

160
00:28:34.963 --> 00:28:36.013
It's all right, mate.

161
00:28:36.131 --> 00:28:39.759
Here they come!
Close the gates! They're coming back!

162
00:29:49.329 --> 00:29:53.458
Hold your fire! He comes in peace!

163
00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:58.254
- For Christ's sake, hold your fire!
- Shut up.

164
00:30:51.141 --> 00:30:53.476
Greetings from the Humungus!

165
00:30:54.144 --> 00:30:55.812
The Lord Humungus!

166
00:30:56.563 --> 00:30:59.315
The Warrior of the Wasteland!

167
00:31:01.443 --> 00:31:05.155
The Ayatollah of Rock 'n' Roll-ah!

168
00:31:07.824 --> 00:31:10.076
I am gravely disappointed.

169
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.830
Again you have made me
unleash my dogs of war.

170
00:31:14.497 --> 00:31:16.332
- Look at what remains...
- Help!

171
00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:18.584
- ...of your gallant scouts.
- Kill him now...

172
00:31:18.668 --> 00:31:21.963
- Why? Because you're selfish.
- ...while you've got the chance.

173
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.840
You hoard your gasoline.

174
00:31:24.507 --> 00:31:27.260
- You will not listen to reason.
- Don't listen to him!

175
00:31:27.427 --> 00:31:29.512
Now, my prisoners say

176
00:31:29.763 --> 00:31:33.099
you plan to take your gasoline
out of the wasteland.

177
00:31:33.516 --> 00:31:36.895
You sent them out this morning
to find a vehicle.

178
00:31:37.437 --> 00:31:41.733
A rig big enough to haul
that fat tank of gas.

179
00:31:42.525 --> 00:31:44.194
What a puny plan.

180
00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:46.404
Look around you.

181
00:31:48.615 --> 00:31:50.992
This is the Valley of Death.

182
00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:52.202
See!

183
00:31:52.952 --> 00:31:56.873
Nothing can escape!
The Humungus rules the wasteland!

184
00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.211
Give them nothing. Blow it up.
Give them...

185
00:32:03.004 --> 00:32:05.048
Humungus will not be defied.

186
00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:29.364
Wez. Wez.

187
00:32:29.906 --> 00:32:31.699
- Listen to me!
- Aah!

188
00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:40.083
I got it. I got it.

189
00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:49.300
Good one.

190
00:32:54.556 --> 00:32:57.725
Quiet. Quiet. No more games.

191
00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.353
No more games!

192
00:33:01.062 --> 00:33:02.897
We are here for a purpose.

193
00:33:03.439 --> 00:33:05.275
We've come with an offer.

194
00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:12.115
No. No more talk.

195
00:33:12.323 --> 00:33:14.617
We go in. We kill.

196
00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:16.911
We'll kill them!

197
00:33:19.622 --> 00:33:23.042
We'll kill them! Kill them. Kill them!

198
00:33:25.295 --> 00:33:26.963
Do you see him?

199
00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:32.135
Kill! Kill!

200
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.098
Be still, my dog of war.

201
00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:39.267
I understand your pain.

202
00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:43.479
We all lost someone we love.
But we do it my way.

203
00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:45.607
Losers. Losers wait.

204
00:33:45.815 --> 00:33:47.817
We do it my way.

205
00:33:47.984 --> 00:33:52.614
Their fear is our ally.
The gasoline will be ours.

206
00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:55.950
Then you shall have your revenge.

207
00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:02.707
Take him away.

208
00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:21.434
There has been
too much violence, too much pain.

209
00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:24.187
None here are without sin.

210
00:34:25.605 --> 00:34:27.690
But I have an honorable compromise.

211
00:34:28.691 --> 00:34:30.235
Just walk away.

212
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.528
Give me the pump

213
00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.197
the oil

214
00:34:34.822 --> 00:34:36.324
the gasoline,

215
00:34:36.783 --> 00:34:40.328
and the whole compound,
and I'll spare your lives.

216
00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:45.458
Just walk away. I will give you
safe passage in the wasteland.

217
00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:49.712
Just walk away
and there will be an end to the horror.

218
00:34:55.218 --> 00:34:56.970
I await your answer.

219
00:34:57.428 --> 00:34:59.764
You have one full day to decide.

220
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.085
We'll never walk away!

221
00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.587
Never!

222
00:35:53.234 --> 00:35:56.321
You heard what he said.
It sounds reasonable.

223
00:35:56.904 --> 00:35:59.115
We don't have to die.

224
00:35:59.615 --> 00:36:01.826
All we have to do is walk away.

225
00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:03.328
No. We've worked too hard.

226
00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:05.747
It's simple.
All we do is change the fuel,

227
00:36:05.913 --> 00:36:07.663
and this junkyard for our lives.

228
00:36:07.749 --> 00:36:10.149
Look, if we walk out there,
they'll slaughter us.

229
00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:13.504
They'll set us loose
and then cut us down like pigs.

230
00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:15.048
Don't listen to them.

231
00:36:15.214 --> 00:36:17.633
All right. All right. This is it.

232
00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:20.136
I'll talk to this Humungus.

233
00:36:20.636 --> 00:36:21.637
Bloody fool.

234
00:36:21.804 --> 00:36:23.681
He's a reasonable man

235
00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:26.642
open to negotiation.

236
00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:30.104
He promised us safe passage.
He gave his word.

237
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:32.523
And let us suppose he keeps it,

238
00:36:33.149 --> 00:36:36.736
and we walk away from here
with our lives. What then?

239
00:37:46.013 --> 00:37:47.515
But remember.

240
00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:51.310
Remember one thing.
That is more than just a tanker of gas.

241
00:37:51.477 --> 00:37:55.898
That is our lifeline to a place
beyond that vermin on machines.

242
00:37:56.566 --> 00:37:58.860
That's 2000 miles from here!

243
00:37:59.527 --> 00:38:02.613
How do you expect us to get it there?
Drag it?

244
00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.575
If we have to, yes.
There's always a way.

245
00:38:06.576 --> 00:38:08.286
But the first step

246
00:38:09.328 --> 00:38:10.913
defend the fuel.

247
00:38:12.165 --> 00:38:13.332
Words.

248
00:38:14.083 --> 00:38:15.460
Just words!

249
00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:17.753
You'd die for a pipe dream!

250
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.756
Wrong. We fight for a belief. I stay.

251
00:38:29.891 --> 00:38:32.268
I wish it could have worked, Pappagallo.

252
00:38:32.435 --> 00:38:34.687
You can't expect to compete with that.

253
00:38:35.271 --> 00:38:38.816
Every day we get weaker
while they get stronger. It's finished.

254
00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:40.776
I'm sorry.

255
00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:50.661
Two days ago I saw a vehicle
that'd haul that tanker.

256
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.540
You wanna get out of here

257
00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:56.709
you talk to me.

258
00:39:01.964 --> 00:39:03.966
Okay, so that's my offer.

259
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.635
I deliver a rig big enough
to haul that tanker

260
00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:10.139
you give me back my vehicle
and as much juice as I can carry.

261
00:39:10.306 --> 00:39:12.475
We lost eight good people this morning.

262
00:39:14.977 --> 00:39:16.854
What's he got in mind?

263
00:39:17.396 --> 00:39:20.399
Now, to do the job
I need five gallons of diesel,

264
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.568
and some high-octane gasoline.

265
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.199
Think of it as a down payment.

266
00:39:28.491 --> 00:39:30.993
And that's the last we'll ever see of him.

267
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.329
He has to come back for his wheels.

268
00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:35.540
What have we got to lose?

269
00:39:37.833 --> 00:39:39.669
You've got yourself a deal.

270
00:40:04.318 --> 00:40:07.154
My vehicle and all the juice I can carry.

271
00:40:58.247 --> 00:40:59.707
Come on, dog.

272
00:41:01.042 --> 00:41:02.418
Shh!

273
00:43:53.756 --> 00:43:56.926
You know what
I miss most of all? Clean women.

274
00:43:57.968 --> 00:44:00.679
Nail polish, perfume

275
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:05.267
the smell of bicycle seats, cocktails...

276
00:44:05.935 --> 00:44:07.603
- Shut up.
- Desserts.

277
00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:12.274
Lingerie. Remember lingerie?

278
00:44:23.077 --> 00:44:25.454
I knew it. I knew it'd work.

279
00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:29.667
Lethal. Lethal, these snakes.
Born killers.

280
00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.461
Down!

281
00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:35.673
It's my snake. I trained it.
I'm gonna eat it.

282
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.218
So find your own. Get out of it.

283
00:44:39.885 --> 00:44:42.805
I've got a recipe for snake. Delicious.

284
00:44:43.639 --> 00:44:46.267
Fricassee of reptile. Get out.

285
00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:48.936
Better than your dog food. No!

286
00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:53.023
Pure protein, minerals, vitamins.

287
00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:55.985
A man's gotta look after himself.

288
00:44:56.277 --> 00:44:58.654
Healthy mind, healthy body, dog.

289
00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:02.575
Hey! You are what you eat, I reckon.
Get away!

290
00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:06.495
You two ought to take a look
in the mirror some time.

291
00:45:06.662 --> 00:45:08.706
No style, no taste.

292
00:45:10.833 --> 00:45:12.001
Empty.

293
00:45:12.835 --> 00:45:14.670
All this time.

294
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:21.802
That's dishonest. Low.

295
00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:27.641
Let's have a look
at this machine of yours.

296
00:45:28.517 --> 00:45:30.853
How do I know that one's not a dud?

297
00:45:31.645 --> 00:45:34.607
- Find out.
- Cool. Cool, cool.

298
00:45:35.691 --> 00:45:39.444
Now, you've gotta understand the basics
of aerodynamics in a thing like this.

299
00:45:39.528 --> 00:45:40.863
Shut up. Shut up.

300
00:46:22.905 --> 00:46:25.824
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

301
00:46:26.241 --> 00:46:29.453
What about me, eh?
You're not gonna leave me here, are you?

302
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.249
Do what you want.

303
00:46:36.418 --> 00:46:38.337
We're partners.

304
00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:49.932
You and me, we're partners.

305
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:52.101
Partners!

306
00:48:00.502 --> 00:48:01.670
Go. Go.

307
00:50:50.172 --> 00:50:51.506
- Whoo!
- Aah!

308
00:51:32.464 --> 00:51:35.092
My dogs, run. The gate.

309
00:51:39.805 --> 00:51:44.101
The gate. The gate. The gate.

310
00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:07.601
You. You can run, but you can't hide.

311
00:53:33.835 --> 00:53:35.837
You did a great job.

312
00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:37.881
That's my man.

313
00:53:38.632 --> 00:53:40.175
That's my man.

314
00:53:40.342 --> 00:53:42.302
Don't go overboard now.

315
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:46.640
No, don't touch, please.
It's a precision instrument.

316
00:53:49.434 --> 00:53:51.228
Don't touch.

317
00:53:51.853 --> 00:53:53.688
Ah, ah, ah.

318
00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.195
Don't touch.

319
00:54:00.487 --> 00:54:02.531
Shoo, shoo. Go.

320
00:54:04.366 --> 00:54:05.867
Shoo! Shoo!

321
00:54:06.034 --> 00:54:07.119
Go on.

322
00:54:10.455 --> 00:54:13.208
Tell me, son, this machine of yours

323
00:54:14.543 --> 00:54:16.670
it can take two, can it?

324
00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:19.923
Possibly.

325
00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:26.346
All right?

326
00:54:26.513 --> 00:54:29.975
I'm okay. Just get them organized,
we're moving out tonight.

327
00:54:34.146 --> 00:54:37.399
Okay, listen, everyone.
We're going out tonight.

328
00:54:37.566 --> 00:54:39.943
You all know what to do,
just get on with it.

329
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.737
Timbo, Derek, Pappagallo's been hurt.

330
00:54:44.239 --> 00:54:45.740
How's the rig?

331
00:54:46.908 --> 00:54:48.577
The rig. How is she?

332
00:54:48.743 --> 00:54:50.143
A cracked timing case cover.

333
00:54:50.245 --> 00:54:52.330
It's broken some teeth
off the timing gears.

334
00:54:52.414 --> 00:54:54.207
It's got a cracked timing case cover.

335
00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:56.793
It's broken a couple of teeth
off the timing gears.

336
00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.421
- The radiator's damaged at the core.
- The radiator's damaged at the core.

337
00:55:00.505 --> 00:55:03.174
- A cracked water pump.
- It's got a cracked water pump.

338
00:55:03.258 --> 00:55:06.719
- And a fractured injector line.
- And it's got a fractured injector line.

339
00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:08.096
Well, what does all that mean?

340
00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.515
Yeah, okay, but what does that mean?

341
00:55:11.057 --> 00:55:13.017
- What does that mean?
- Twenty-four hours.

342
00:55:13.101 --> 00:55:14.603
Twenty-four hours.

343
00:55:15.937 --> 00:55:17.314
They've got 12.

344
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:19.941
- You've got 12.
- Okay.

345
00:55:20.108 --> 00:55:21.109
Okay.

346
00:55:21.276 --> 00:55:23.653
Let's get him down. Quick, come on.

347
00:55:29.075 --> 00:55:31.620
Listen, I was wrong about you,

348
00:55:32.037 --> 00:55:33.580
and I'm sorry.

349
00:55:49.304 --> 00:55:50.430
Heel.

350
00:55:50.597 --> 00:55:53.558
It's been a long time
since I've seen driving like that, man.

351
00:55:53.642 --> 00:55:55.560
You're okay by me, son.

352
00:55:55.727 --> 00:55:59.397
With you driving that rig, we got it
licked! Nice to have you aboard, son.

353
00:55:59.564 --> 00:56:02.359
I've been saving those.
I want you to have them.

354
00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:08.198
Thank you, and welcome.

355
00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:14.370
It's been a pleasure doing business
with you, but I'm leaving.

356
00:56:14.454 --> 00:56:16.331
I'm leaving. Thanks.

357
00:56:23.338 --> 00:56:24.965
Oh, my God, look!

358
00:56:25.131 --> 00:56:26.675
Up on the hill!

359
00:56:27.342 --> 00:56:30.095
They're stringing them up, the bastards!

360
00:56:31.972 --> 00:56:33.056
Look!

361
00:56:39.354 --> 00:56:41.481
You have defied me.

362
00:56:42.315 --> 00:56:46.695
You will know the vengeance
of Lord Humungus.

363
00:56:47.821 --> 00:56:49.406
I promise you

364
00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:51.866
nobody

365
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:56.204
nobody gets out of here alive.

366
00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:51.676
Who's supposed to be helping out
with the drums? Come on!

367
00:57:53.011 --> 00:57:55.930
Hey, don't forget,
don't waste a bit before we leave.

368
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.644
Just wanna catch the pigs.

369
00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:03.104
Come on with the drums, come on!

370
00:58:03.271 --> 00:58:05.398
Is anybody helping over there?

371
00:58:09.235 --> 00:58:10.445
Hey, come on!

372
00:58:43.645 --> 00:58:46.731
What's wrong? Come on.

373
00:58:47.232 --> 00:58:50.694
It just seems really wrong,
sneaking away like this.

374
00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.320
What?

375
00:58:54.698 --> 00:58:57.867
But you said you wanted to come,
sweetheart.

376
00:58:58.076 --> 00:58:59.828
I know I did, but...

377
00:59:00.995 --> 00:59:04.290
Look, you're scared. Now, come on,
it'll be much safer up there.

378
00:59:04.457 --> 00:59:06.793
- What are we waiting for, eh?
- No, don't.

379
00:59:08.795 --> 00:59:10.505
This is my family.

380
00:59:12.006 --> 00:59:14.467
I'm not gonna leave these people.

381
00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:17.137
I'm staying.

382
00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:20.807
I'm sorry.

383
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.737
Come on, keep it together.

384
00:59:50.962 --> 00:59:53.548
I told you, he's leaving.
What did I tell you?

385
00:59:53.715 --> 00:59:55.216
Look, he's leaving.

386
00:59:57.051 --> 01:00:01.431
Look, I don't have time for long speeches.
I want you to drive the tanker.

387
01:00:03.224 --> 01:00:04.392
Sorry.

388
01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:09.105
We had a contract.
I kept my part of the bargain.

389
01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:12.192
We'll make a new contract.

390
01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:17.947
I've got all I need here.

391
01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:22.368
You don't have a future.
I could offer you that. Rebuild our lives.

392
01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:23.620
Max

393
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.955
buy a ticket for 2000 miles.

394
01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:30.418
You have to come, sonny.
This is where we're going. Paradise.

395
01:00:31.252 --> 01:00:33.087
Two thousand miles from here.

396
01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:35.840
Fresh water, plenty of sunshine.

397
01:00:36.382 --> 01:00:38.384
Nothing to do but breed.

398
01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:41.429
No, thanks.

399
01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:45.183
What is it with you, huh?
What are you looking for?

400
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:48.686
Come on, Max,
everyone's looking for something.

401
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:51.231
You happy out there, are you?

402
01:00:51.397 --> 01:00:54.484
Eh? Wandering?
One day blurring into another?

403
01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:58.279
You're a scavenger, Max.
You're a maggot.

404
01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:00.198
Do you know that?

405
01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:03.117
You're living off the corpse
of the old world.

406
01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:05.911
Tell me your story.
Come on, tell me your story.

407
01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:07.497
What burned you out?

408
01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.165
Kill one man too many?

409
01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:11.668
See too many people die?
Lose some family?

410
01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:16.130
Oh, so that's it. You lost some family.
That make you something special, does it?

411
01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:17.966
Listen to me.

412
01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:43.157
Do you think
you're the only one that's suffered?

413
01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:47.287
We've all been through it in here.
But we haven't given up.

414
01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:51.332
We're still human beings with dignity.

415
01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:55.587
But you, you're out there
with the garbage.

416
01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:57.672
You're nothing.

417
01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:40.798
Get out, kid.

418
01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:45.720
Come on, get out of here.

419
01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:09.661
Go on, get out. Scat. Get out.

420
01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:43.111
You're letting him go?

421
01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:47.281
Well, let's keep his vehicle, at least.

422
01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:51.744
He fulfilled his contract.
He's an honorable man.

423
01:03:53.287 --> 01:03:55.957
Okay, so who's gonna drive the tanker?

424
01:03:57.291 --> 01:03:58.376
I am.

425
01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:27.697
They've got you wrong,
you're not a coward.

426
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:30.324
Stupid maybe, but not a coward.

427
01:04:31.492 --> 01:04:33.828
You're making a serious mistake

428
01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:37.040
splitting a great team.

429
01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.710
You and me together,
think of the possibilities.

430
01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:43.838
See you around, maybe.
Goodbye, good luck.

431
01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:12.408
We go!

432
01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:26.214
You disobey me. You puppy.

433
01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:31.279
Toadie, the gas. Hurry up.

434
01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:42.456
Don't waste him. If he's alive

435
01:06:43.457 --> 01:06:44.792
I want him.

436
01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:15.323
The tanks are full, Oh mighty Wez,
and it's all yours!

437
01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:11.879
It's all over.

438
01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:14.090
Let's go.

439
01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.896
Look, out there. Northwest.

440
01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:38.572
Oh, hell.

441
01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:42.910
You blew it, you fool.

442
01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.740
Relax, partner.

443
01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.005
I'll be driving the tanker.

444
01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:45.134
We're gonna crash or crash through.

445
01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:50.139
Now, at this point, that's all they want.
The tanker.

446
01:11:50.764 --> 01:11:52.892
So they'll come straight after us.

447
01:11:53.058 --> 01:11:55.769
So we'll use that to punch our way out

448
01:11:56.061 --> 01:11:58.939
which will give all of you
a very, very good chance.

449
01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.941
Now, don't hesitate.

450
01:12:01.108 --> 01:12:05.196
Once you're outside there,
split up and go as hard as you can.

451
01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:08.532
Now, 200 miles to the north

452
01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:13.621
there's a place with a bridge
called Powder River.

453
01:12:14.038 --> 01:12:15.956
That's our rendezvous.

454
01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:19.084
Give us till sunset.

455
01:12:20.127 --> 01:12:23.714
If we haven't made it by then,
keep going.

456
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:26.842
Good enough for me to build,
but not to ride on?

457
01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:29.594
- You are not coming on this tanker!
- I sweated blood on this,

458
01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:32.472
and no bastard's gonna tell me
to ride in no school bus!

459
01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:34.141
Okay, settle down!

460
01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:36.644
If it's all the same to you

461
01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:40.231
I'll drive that tanker.

462
01:12:41.398 --> 01:12:45.152
The offer is closed. Too late for deals.

463
01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:48.364
No deals. I wanna drive that truck.

464
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:52.326
Why? Why the big change of heart?

465
01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:54.328
Believe me, I haven't got a choice.

466
01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:56.622
And how do you think you'll do it?

467
01:12:56.789 --> 01:13:00.167
I mean, look at you.
You couldn't even drive a wheelchair.

468
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:04.755
You should look at yourself, Max.
You're a mess.

469
01:13:06.173 --> 01:13:08.050
Come on, cut the crap.

470
01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:12.179
I'm the best chance you've got.

471
01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:22.314
Right, let's get moving.

472
01:14:34.094 --> 01:14:36.305
Move that kid! Get rid of him!

473
01:15:52.673 --> 01:15:53.966
Oh, shit!

474
01:19:09.202 --> 01:19:13.290
Go! Go, go, go, go!

475
01:20:23.735 --> 01:20:25.737
I'm all right, I'm all right.

476
01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:33.787
Move it. Move it.

477
01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:07.988
Come on, come on, come on!

478
01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:45.275
Whoa!

479
01:23:03.895 --> 01:23:06.940
The tire! Shoot the tire!

480
01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:43.680
Boy! Come on, jump!

481
01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:45.974
Come on, jump!

482
01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:47.726
I say.

483
01:25:48.601 --> 01:25:49.936
We've won.

484
01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:52.230
It's over, boy.

485
01:27:40.547 --> 01:27:41.673
Hey, kid.

486
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:44.300
Get the bullet. The bullet.

487
01:27:44.717 --> 01:27:46.511
Get up. Go on.

488
01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:52.183
Get the shell.

489
01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:55.228
Get the shell.

490
01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:57.147
Come on. Come on, go!

491
01:31:29.108 --> 01:31:32.445
<i>And so began the journey north to safety</i>

492
01:31:33.112 --> 01:31:34.781
<i>to our place in the sun.</i>

493
01:31:35.365 --> 01:31:39.369
<i>Among us we found a new leader,
the man who came from the sky</i>

494
01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:41.496
<i>the Gyro Captain.</i>

495
01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:44.290
<i>And just as Pappagallo had planned</i>

496
01:31:44.457 --> 01:31:47.794
<i>we traveled far beyond
the reach of men on machines.</i>

497
01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:52.632
<i>The juice, the precious juice,
was hidden in the vehicles.</i>

498
01:31:54.384 --> 01:31:56.594
<i>As for me, I grew to manhood</i>

499
01:31:57.261 --> 01:32:00.181
<i>in the fullness of time,
I became the leader</i>

500
01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:02.975
<i>the chief of the Great Northern Tribe.</i>

501
01:32:04.894 --> 01:32:06.729
<i>And the Road Warrior?</i>

502
01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:10.233
<i>That was the last we ever saw of him.</i>

503
01:32:11.150 --> 01:32:15.321
<i>He lives now only in my memories.</i>
