00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,600
Hello.

2
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,229
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

3
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:25,820
Do you want a chocolate?

4
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:31,826
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

5
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:38,207
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,087
You never know what you're gonna get.

7
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:52,847
Those must be comfortable shoes.

8
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:58,894
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

9
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:03,566
I wish I had shoes like that.

10
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:05,776
My feet hurt.

11
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:08,654
Mama always said there's an awful lot

12
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:11,949
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

13
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:16,036
Where they're going,
where they've been.

14
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:25,337
I've worn lots of shoes.

15
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:33,261
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

16
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:38,808
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

17
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:42,228
She said they was my magic shoes.

18
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:45,481
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

19
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:55,241
Let's take a little walk around.

20
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,833
How do those feel?

21
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:08,963
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

22
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:11,549
as strong as I've ever seen,

23
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:15,011
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

24
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:19,390
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

25
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:20,600
Forrest!

26
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:23,311
Now, when I was a baby,

27
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:26,231
Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,

28
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:28,733
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

29
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:31,027
She said we was related to him
in some way.

30
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:32,487
And what he did was,

31
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:36,824
he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.

32
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:40,245
They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets

33
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:44,666
and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.

34
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,628
They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.

35
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:51,756
And anyway, that's how I got my name,

36
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,258
Forrest Gump.

37
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:55,093
Mama said that the "Forrest" part

38
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:58,721
was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,

39
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:01,599
well, just don't make no sense.

40
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:10,775
Okay... Get it, get it...

41
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:13,820
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

42
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:16,239
All right...

43
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:18,491
What are you all staring at?

44
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:23,037
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

45
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:28,293
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

46
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:30,962
If God intended
everybody to be the same,

47
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:33,172
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

48
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:37,051
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

49
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:42,015
We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,

50
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:45,143
about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

51
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:47,979
That's in the county of Greenbow.

52
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,483
Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa

53
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:54,485
had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,

54
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,486
something like that.

55
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:59,281
Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,

56
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:02,117
Mama decided to let those rooms out,

57
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:04,161
mostly to people passing through,

58
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:08,206
like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

59
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,001
That's how me and Mama got money.

60
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:13,837
Mama was a real smart lady.

61
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:18,925
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

62
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:23,805
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

63
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,060
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

64
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:33,023
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

65
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:35,317
Now, his IQ is 75.

66
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,237
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

67
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,868
She wanted me to have
the finest education,

68
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:48,872
so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.

69
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:51,208
I met the principal and all.

70
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:54,586
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

71
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:57,923
Now, this is normal.

72
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:01,718
Forrest is right here.

73
00:08:02,553 --> 00:08:08,100
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

74
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:11,478
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

75
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:13,688
Now, he'll be just fine.

76
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:16,566
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

77
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:20,028
He might be a bit on the slow side,

78
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:22,906
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

79
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,534
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

80
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:29,413
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

81
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:32,666
We're talking about
five little points here.

82
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:37,003
There must be something can be done.

83
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:41,049
We're a progressive school system.

84
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:44,803
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

85
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,141
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

86
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,271
He's on vacation.

87
00:09:11,747 --> 00:09:15,542
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

88
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:23,507
You don't say much, do you?

89
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,979
"Finally, he had to try.

90
00:09:37,063 --> 00:09:39,023
"It looked easy, but,

91
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,568
"oh, what happened.

92
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:45,654
- "First, there..."
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

93
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:48,782
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

94
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:54,121
Vacation's when you go somewhere

95
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,834
and you don't ever come back.

96
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:06,967
Anyway, I guess you could say
me and Mama was on our own.

97
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:11,805
But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.

98
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,475
There was always folks
coming and going.

99
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,643
Supper.

100
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:19,146
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

101
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:21,774
Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us

102
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:24,527
that every room
was filled with travelers.

103
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:28,239
You know, folks living out
of their suitcases

104
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:31,283
and hat cases and sample cases.

105
00:10:31,368 --> 00:10:34,787
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime!
Forrest...

106
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:37,414
One time, a young man
was staying with us,

107
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:41,126
and he had him a guitar case.

108
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,103
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

109
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:00,521
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

110
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:03,440
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

111
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,485
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

112
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,530
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

113
00:11:10,198 --> 00:11:13,784
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

114
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:15,744
Slow it down some.

115
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:19,790
I liked that guitar.

116
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,209
It sounded good.

117
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:28,173
I started moving around to the music,

118
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:30,092
swinging my hips.

119
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,222
This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,

120
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:38,309
and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,

121
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:39,977
and guess what?

122
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:55,158
This is not for children's eyes.

123
00:11:57,703 --> 00:11:59,495
Some years later,
that handsome young man

124
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,123
who they called "The King,"

125
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,542
well, he'd sung too many songs,

126
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,754
had himself a heart attack,
or something.

127
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,007
Must be hard being a king.

128
00:12:15,304 --> 00:12:18,139
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

129
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:22,769
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

130
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,067
I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.

131
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:34,322
Are you coming along?

132
00:12:34,406 --> 00:12:37,909
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

133
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:40,161
This is the bus to school.

134
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:45,375
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

135
00:12:46,335 --> 00:12:50,338
- I'm Dorothy Harris.
- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

136
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:05,144
This seat's taken.

137
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:09,107
It's taken!

138
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,866
You can't sit here.

139
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:24,455
You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,

140
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,916
'cause I don't remember being born.

141
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:30,712
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

142
00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:33,881
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.

143
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:38,678
But I do remember the first time I heard

144
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:41,597
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

145
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:44,475
You can sit here if you want.

146
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:51,274
I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

147
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:54,068
She was like an angel.

148
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:57,071
Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?

149
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:03,828
What's wrong with your legs?

150
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:08,166
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

151
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:11,252
I just sat next to her on that bus

152
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:13,421
and had a conversation
all the way to school.

153
00:14:13,505 --> 00:14:16,215
...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

154
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,467
These are going to make me...

155
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:22,304
And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.

156
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:24,806
Are you stupid or something?

157
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:27,893
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

158
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,190
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

159
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:35,692
From that day on,
we was always together.

160
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:38,612
Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots.

161
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,825
She taught me how to climb.

162
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,620
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

163
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:49,331
I showed her how to dangle.

164
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:51,458
"...a good little monkey and..."

165
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:56,463
She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.

166
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,552
Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.

167
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:07,557
- Mama's gonna worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.

168
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,562
For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.

169
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:14,731
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.

170
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:18,318
She was my most special friend.

171
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:23,406
My only friend.

172
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:30,997
Now, my mama always told me that
miracles happen every day.

173
00:15:31,082 --> 00:15:33,458
Some people don't think so, but they do.

174
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:38,088
Hey, dummy!

175
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:41,132
Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?

176
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:44,719
- "Look, I'm Forrest Gimp."
- Just run away, Forrest.

177
00:15:46,055 --> 00:15:49,140
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

178
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:52,477
- Get the bikes!
- Hurry up! Let's get him!

179
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:55,105
- Come on!
- Look out, dummy, here we come!

180
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:57,023
We're gonna get you!

181
00:15:57,984 --> 00:16:01,736
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

182
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,365
Come back here, you!

183
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:21,464
Run, Forrest!

184
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:22,966
Run!

185
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:57,041
Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,

186
00:16:58,168 --> 00:17:00,669
but I can run like the wind blows.

187
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:07,009
From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,

188
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,136
I was running!

189
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,597
He's getting away! Stop him!

190
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:46,048
That boy sure is a running fool.

191
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:51,637
Now, remember how I told you that

192
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:54,640
Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?

193
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:57,810
Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

194
00:17:57,894 --> 00:18:00,062
Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,

195
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:03,482
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.

196
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,360
Jenny?

197
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,612
He was a very loving man.

198
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:13,325
He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters.

199
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:19,498
And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.

200
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,544
Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?

201
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:25,671
Daddy's taking a nap.

202
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:27,464
- Jenny!
- Come on!

203
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:31,468
Jenny, where'd you run to?

204
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:35,472
You'd better get back here, girl!

205
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,600
Where you at?

206
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,274
Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?

207
00:18:48,278 --> 00:18:49,611
Jenny!

208
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:52,656
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

209
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:53,907
Jenny!

210
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:57,202
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

211
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:59,038
far, far away from here.

212
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:02,791
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

213
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,001
far, far away from here.

214
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:07,171
Mama always said
that God is mysterious.

215
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:08,422
Jenny!

216
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:10,841
He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.

217
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,051
You'd better get back here!

218
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:13,635
Instead,

219
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:18,848
he had the police say Jenny didn't
have to stay in that house no more.

220
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:23,019
She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

221
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:26,314
which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.

222
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:33,946
Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,

223
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:37,158
just 'cause she said she was scared.

224
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,702
Scared of what, I don't know,

225
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:43,039
but I think it was her grandma's dog.

226
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,916
He was a mean dog.

227
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:48,377
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends

228
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:49,754
all the way up through high school.

229
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:53,758
- Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!

230
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:57,178
- Run, Forrest, run!
- Hey,

231
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,347
did you hear me, stupid?

232
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,640
- Run, Forrest!
- Come on, get in the truck!

233
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:02,850
Get in the truck! Let's move it!

234
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,686
Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

235
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,939
Run, Forrest! Run!

236
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:11,567
- You better be running, stupid!
- Come on, dummy!

237
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:17,031
- Haul ass, dummy!
- Yeah, you better get running!

238
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:21,702
Jack rabbit!

239
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,379
Yeah!

240
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:34,382
Go! Go! Go!

241
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:37,718
Run, Forrest!

242
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:44,308
Now, it used to be,
I ran to get where I was going,

243
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:48,396
I never thought it would
take me anywhere.

244
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:21,596
- Who in the hell is that?
- That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

245
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:24,432
Just a local idiot.

246
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,603
And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.

247
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,820
Forrest! Forrest! Run!

248
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:39,530
- Okay!
- Run!

249
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:43,158
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

250
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:58,173
You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run!

251
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:03,303
No! Turn! Go!

252
00:22:14,523 --> 00:22:18,151
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

253
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,153
but he sure is fast!

254
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:28,161
Now, maybe it's just me,
but college was very confusing times.

255
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:31,414
Federal troops enforcing a court order

256
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:34,501
integrated the University
of Alabama today.

257
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:35,794
Two negroes were admitted,

258
00:22:35,878 --> 00:22:39,172
but only after Governor George Wallace
had carried out his symbolic threat

259
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,799
to stand in the school house door.

260
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:45,553
Governor Wallace,
I take it from that statement, that...

261
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,681
Earl, what's going on?

262
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:51,101
- Coons are trying to get into school.
- Coons?

263
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:52,852
When raccoons try to get
on our back porch,

264
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:54,729
Mama just chase them off with a broom.

265
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:59,359
Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,
and they want to go to school with us.

266
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,903
With us? They do?

267
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:05,365
Shortly after Governor Wallace
had carried out his promise

268
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:06,658
to block the doorway,

269
00:23:06,742 --> 00:23:08,702
President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defense

270
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:10,787
then to use military force.

271
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:13,581
Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,

272
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,960
commander of the National Guard,
and Governor Wallace.

273
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:20,755
...because these National Guardsmen
are here today

274
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,383
as federal soldiers for Alabamans.

275
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:27,387
They live within our borders,
they are all our brothers.

276
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,889
We are winning in this fight,

277
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:32,976
because we are awakening
the American people

278
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,396
to the dangers that we have spoken
about so many times,

279
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,777
just so evident today, the trend towards
military dictatorship in this country.

280
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,700
And so, at day's end,
the University of Alabama

281
00:23:48,784 --> 00:23:51,077
in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated

282
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:54,164
and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone

283
00:23:54,248 --> 00:23:57,334
had been signed up
for summer classes.

284
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,756
Ma'am, you dropped your book.
Ma'am...

285
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,258
Governor Wallace did what
he promised to do.

286
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,887
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...

287
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:11,096
Say, wasn't that Gump?

288
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:15,267
- Nah, that couldn't be.
- It sure as hell was.

289
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:21,857
A few years later, that angry little man

290
00:24:21,941 --> 00:24:24,443
at the school house door
thought it would be a good idea

291
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:26,695
and ran for president.

292
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:32,451
But somebody thought that it wasn't.

293
00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:36,205
But he didn't die.

294
00:24:40,794 --> 00:24:42,461
My bus is here.

295
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:46,298
- Is it the number nine?
- No, it's the number four.

296
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,468
It was nice talking to you.

297
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:56,475
I remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.

298
00:24:57,352 --> 00:24:58,811
I was in college.

299
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:00,104
Did you go to a girls' college,

300
00:25:00,188 --> 00:25:02,022
or to a girls-and-boys-together college?

301
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:03,148
It was co-ed.

302
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:05,943
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

303
00:25:06,027 --> 00:25:08,362
It was a college just for girls.

304
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:11,657
But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.

305
00:25:42,355 --> 00:25:43,772
That hurts.

306
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:56,952
Forrest! Forrest!

307
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:02,124
- Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
- Jesus!

308
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,333
What are you doing?

309
00:26:03,418 --> 00:26:05,085
- He was hurting you.
- What the hell is going on here?

310
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:08,881
- No, he's not! Get over there!
- Who is that? Who is that?

311
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:10,048
- Billy, I'm sorry.
- What the hell?

312
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:12,718
- Just get away from me!
- Don't...

313
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:15,762
- Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
- Get away from me.

314
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:18,056
He doesn't know any better!

315
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:22,478
Forrest, why did you do that?

316
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,400
I brought you some chocolate.

317
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:30,486
I'm sorry.

318
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:35,949
- I'll go back to my college now.
- Forrest...

319
00:26:39,661 --> 00:26:41,245
Look at you.

320
00:26:43,332 --> 00:26:45,416
Come on. Come on.

321
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:54,800
Is this your room?

322
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:01,516
Do you ever dream, Forrest,

323
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:05,686
about who you're gonna be?

324
00:27:05,771 --> 00:27:07,563
- Who I'm gonna be?
- Yeah.

325
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,524
Aren't I going to be me?

326
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:13,277
Well, you'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

327
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:17,448
You know? I want to be famous.

328
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,953
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

329
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:26,290
I just want to be on an empty stage

330
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,668
with my guitar, my voice.

331
00:27:30,504 --> 00:27:31,963
Just me.

332
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:36,801
And I want to reach people
on the personal level.

333
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:42,807
I want to be able to say things,
just one-to-one.

334
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:53,192
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

335
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:58,489
I sit next to them in my Home
Economics class all the time.

336
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:29,854
- I'm... Sorry.
- It's okay.

337
00:28:38,405 --> 00:28:40,114
It's all right.

338
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:45,119
- It's okay.
- Oh, I'm dizzy.

339
00:28:53,795 --> 00:28:56,547
I bet that never happened in Home Ec.

340
00:29:01,386 --> 00:29:02,553
No.

341
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:11,895
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

342
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:14,022
I don't care. I don't like her, anyway.

343
00:29:14,106 --> 00:29:17,484
Run! Run! Run!

344
00:29:17,568 --> 00:29:22,072
- Run! Run! Run!
- Run! Run! Run!

345
00:29:29,997 --> 00:29:34,209
College ran by real fast,
'cause I played so much football.

346
00:29:34,293 --> 00:29:37,545
They even put me on a thing
called the All-America Team,

347
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,424
where you get to meet
the President of the United States.

348
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:43,093
President Kennedy met
with the Collegiate

349
00:29:43,177 --> 00:29:46,763
All-American Football Team
at the Oval Office today.

350
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:49,349
Now, the really good thing
about meeting

351
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:53,228
the President of the United States
is the food.

352
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:56,022
They put you in this little room
with just about anything

353
00:29:56,107 --> 00:29:58,608
you'd want to eat or drink.

354
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,570
And since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,

355
00:30:02,655 --> 00:30:05,323
and number two, they was free,

356
00:30:05,449 --> 00:30:08,493
I must have drank me about
15 Dr. Peppers.

357
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:13,581
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

358
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,417
It's an honor, sir.

359
00:30:15,501 --> 00:30:17,585
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

360
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,295
Very good, sir.

361
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:22,549
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

362
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:24,384
Very good, sir.

363
00:30:24,468 --> 00:30:28,138
- Congratulations. How do you feel?
- I gotta pee.

364
00:30:28,806 --> 00:30:31,099
I believe he said he had to "go pee."

365
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:49,200
Sometime later,
for no particular reason,

366
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:51,703
somebody shot that
nice young President,

367
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:54,205
when he was riding in his car.

368
00:30:54,832 --> 00:30:58,960
And a few years after that,
somebody shot his little brother, too,

369
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:01,171
only he was in a hotel kitchen.

370
00:31:02,631 --> 00:31:05,049
It must be hard being brothers.

371
00:31:06,051 --> 00:31:07,260
I wouldn't know.

372
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:09,220
Forrest Gump.

373
00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:10,597
Now can you believe it?

374
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:14,601
After only five years of playing football,
I got a college degree.

375
00:31:14,685 --> 00:31:16,686
Congratulations, son.

376
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,522
Mama was so proud.

377
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:24,694
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
Here, I'll hold this for you.

378
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,905
Congratulations, son.

379
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:30,033
Have you given any thought
to your future?

380
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:33,203
Thought?

381
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:36,497
Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

382
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:39,583
Nobody gives a hunk of shit
who you are, fuzzball!

383
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:42,336
You're not even a low-life,
scum-sucking maggot!

384
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,381
Get your faggotty ass on the bus.
You're in the Army now!

385
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:48,509
This seat's taken.

386
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:51,762
Taken.

387
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:57,476
At first, it seemed like I made a mistake,

388
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,603
seeing how it was only
my induction day

389
00:31:59,729 --> 00:32:02,439
and I was already getting yelled at.

390
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:07,778
You can sit down if you want to.

391
00:32:07,904 --> 00:32:11,740
I didn't know who I might meet,
or what they might ask.

392
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:14,451
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

393
00:32:14,953 --> 00:32:18,580
No, but I been on a real big boat.

394
00:32:19,374 --> 00:32:22,167
I'm talking about
a shrimp-catching boat.

395
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:24,753
I've been working
on shrimp boats all my life.

396
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:27,631
I started out on my uncle's boat,
that's my mama's brother,

397
00:32:27,757 --> 00:32:29,800
when I was about maybe nine.

398
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:34,054
I was just looking into buying a boat
of my own and got drafted.

399
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:39,768
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba.

400
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:44,064
Just like one of them old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?

401
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:47,818
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

402
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:51,196
So, Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,

403
00:32:51,281 --> 00:32:53,198
and his mama cooked shrimp,

404
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:58,328
and her mama before her
cooked shrimp,

405
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:01,415
and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.

406
00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:02,708
Bubba's family knew everything

407
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:05,419
there was to know
about the shrimping business.

408
00:33:05,503 --> 00:33:08,547
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

409
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:11,633
Matter of fact, I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

410
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,094
after I get out the Army.

411
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:17,806
Okay.

412
00:33:18,016 --> 00:33:22,102
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this Army?

413
00:33:22,186 --> 00:33:24,730
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

414
00:33:24,814 --> 00:33:28,191
God damn it, Gump!
You're a goddamn genius!

415
00:33:28,318 --> 00:33:30,652
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

416
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:33,530
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!

417
00:33:33,656 --> 00:33:36,617
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!

418
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,494
Listen up, people!

419
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:43,790
Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army
like one of them round pegs.

420
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:45,125
It's not really hard.

421
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:48,837
You just make your bed real neat
and remember to stand up straight,

422
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:52,925
and always answer every question
with, "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"

423
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:54,468
Is that clear?

424
00:33:54,552 --> 00:33:56,678
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!

425
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,474
What you do is, you just drag
your nets along the bottom.

426
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:04,310
On a good day, you can catch over
100 pounds of shrimp.

427
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:07,813
If everything goes all right,
two men shrimping 10 hours,

428
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:10,608
less what you spend on gas, you can...

429
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:13,486
- Done, Drill Sergeant!
- Gump!

430
00:34:15,864 --> 00:34:18,616
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly, Gump?

431
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,368
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

432
00:34:20,494 --> 00:34:23,913
Jesus H. Christ,
this is a new company record.

433
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:26,499
If it wouldn't be a waste
of such a damn fine enlisted man,

434
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,876
I'd recommend you for OCS,
Private Gump.

435
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:30,836
You are gonna be
a general some day, Gump.

436
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:34,006
Now, disassemble your weapon
and continue!

437
00:34:36,093 --> 00:34:39,887
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

438
00:34:39,972 --> 00:34:44,725
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

439
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,812
There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole...

440
00:34:48,105 --> 00:34:52,942
...shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

441
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:56,821
There's pineapple shrimp,
lemon shrimp,

442
00:34:56,905 --> 00:34:59,240
coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...

443
00:34:59,574 --> 00:35:05,538
...shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,

444
00:35:05,622 --> 00:35:08,666
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

445
00:35:11,253 --> 00:35:13,587
That's... That's about it.

446
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,261
Night time in the Army is a lonely time.

447
00:35:21,138 --> 00:35:24,765
We'd lay there in our bunks
and I'd miss my mama.

448
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,852
And I'd miss Jenny.

449
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:35,651
Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!

450
00:35:49,124 --> 00:35:52,251
Turns out, Jenny had gotten into
some trouble over

451
00:35:52,335 --> 00:35:55,671
some photos of her
in her college sweater,

452
00:35:55,797 --> 00:35:58,340
and she was thrown out of school.

453
00:36:01,887 --> 00:36:04,096
But that wasn't a bad thing,

454
00:36:04,181 --> 00:36:07,767
because a man who owns
a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,

455
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:12,897
saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.

456
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,524
The first chance I got,

457
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,320
I took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.

458
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:20,905
That was Amber, Amber Flame.

459
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:23,449
Give her a big hand, guys.
Good job, Amber.

460
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:26,285
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

461
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:30,205
direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty,

462
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:34,000
let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbi Dylan.

463
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,838
- All right!
- Bobbi!

464
00:37:01,362 --> 00:37:03,446
Her dream had come true.

465
00:37:04,698 --> 00:37:06,699
She was a folk singer.

466
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,211
Come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up, now.

467
00:37:18,295 --> 00:37:19,796
Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica.

468
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:25,593
Hey, honey, this ain't Captain Kangaroo.

469
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,263
Hey, honey,
I got something here for you.

470
00:37:29,306 --> 00:37:33,059
- God damn it!
- Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!

471
00:37:33,144 --> 00:37:35,603
I'm singing a song here.

472
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,358
Polly, get out here!

473
00:37:40,442 --> 00:37:42,152
- Shut up, there!
- Don't be so shy, honey.

474
00:37:42,236 --> 00:37:43,778
Oh, shut up!

475
00:37:46,448 --> 00:37:49,200
Forrest, what are you doing here?

476
00:37:49,285 --> 00:37:50,994
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

477
00:37:51,078 --> 00:37:52,453
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

478
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,581
Forrest, let me down!

479
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:02,338
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

480
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:04,507
You can't keep trying
to rescue me all the time.

481
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:08,678
- They was trying to grab you.
- A lot of people try to grab me.

482
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:12,765
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

483
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:16,186
I can't help it. I love you.

484
00:38:17,146 --> 00:38:20,648
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

485
00:38:27,948 --> 00:38:30,950
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

486
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:36,331
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

487
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:39,667
Yes, I do.

488
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:46,466
You think I could fly off this bridge?

489
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,308
What do you mean, Jenny?

490
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:00,687
Nothing.

491
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,692
I gotta get out of here.

492
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:09,071
Wait, Jenny...

493
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:13,617
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

494
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:14,993
Can I have a ride?

495
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:16,620
- Where you going?
- I don't care.

496
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:18,080
Get in the truck.

497
00:39:18,164 --> 00:39:19,998
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

498
00:39:22,502 --> 00:39:24,836
They sending me to Vietnam.

499
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,008
It's this whole other country.

500
00:39:32,512 --> 00:39:34,513
Just hang on a minute.

501
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:38,976
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

502
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,396
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

503
00:39:42,522 --> 00:39:44,106
Just run away.

504
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:46,692
Okay.

505
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:52,906
Jenny.

506
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:57,077
I'll write you all the time.

507
00:40:06,212 --> 00:40:09,214
And just like that, she was gone.

508
00:40:25,315 --> 00:40:28,650
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

509
00:41:11,944 --> 00:41:15,906
Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different

510
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,867
from the United States of America.

511
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:23,997
And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.

512
00:41:34,132 --> 00:41:37,218
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

513
00:41:37,302 --> 00:41:40,471
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

514
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:44,100
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

515
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:45,393
we can get American shrimpers

516
00:41:45,477 --> 00:41:47,228
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

517
00:41:47,312 --> 00:41:48,854
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

518
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,149
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

519
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:54,735
You must be my FNGs.

520
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,070
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

521
00:41:56,154 --> 00:41:58,781
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

522
00:41:58,865 --> 00:42:00,991
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

523
00:42:01,076 --> 00:42:03,911
who would love to grease an officer.

524
00:42:03,995 --> 00:42:07,498
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

525
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,793
What's wrong with your lip?

526
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:13,254
I was born with big gums, sir.

527
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:18,050
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

528
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:20,594
Where you boys from in the world?

529
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:23,055
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

530
00:42:23,765 --> 00:42:25,266
You twins?

531
00:42:27,352 --> 00:42:29,770
No, we are not relations, sir.

532
00:42:32,023 --> 00:42:34,942
Look, it's pretty basic here.

533
00:42:35,735 --> 00:42:38,195
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

534
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,948
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

535
00:42:41,032 --> 00:42:42,950
There is one item of GI gear

536
00:42:43,034 --> 00:42:47,204
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

537
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:50,708
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

538
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:52,084
Try and keep your feet dry.

539
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,627
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

540
00:42:53,712 --> 00:42:56,172
to change your socks
whenever we stop.

541
00:42:56,256 --> 00:42:59,216
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

542
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:01,594
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

543
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,137
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

544
00:43:03,221 --> 00:43:05,139
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

545
00:43:05,223 --> 00:43:07,224
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

546
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:12,229
Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff.
I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.

547
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:16,442
He was from a long,
great military tradition.

548
00:43:16,651 --> 00:43:19,737
Somebody in his family
had fought and died

549
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:24,992
in every single American war.

550
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:27,912
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

551
00:43:27,996 --> 00:43:29,121
Get on it!

552
00:43:29,247 --> 00:43:32,583
I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.

553
00:43:34,294 --> 00:43:39,131
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

554
00:43:39,257 --> 00:43:41,425
Little Rock's a fine town.

555
00:43:42,093 --> 00:43:45,679
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

556
00:43:45,764 --> 00:43:48,224
draw what you need for the field.

557
00:43:48,308 --> 00:43:52,269
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

558
00:43:52,354 --> 00:43:55,230
Two standing orders in this platoon:

559
00:43:55,314 --> 00:43:57,982
One, take good care of your feet,

560
00:43:58,108 --> 00:44:03,154
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

561
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,704
I sure hope I don't let him down.

562
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:28,221
I got to see a lot of the countryside.
We would take these real long walks.

563
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:40,817
And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.

564
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:50,910
- Hold it up!
- Hold up, boys!

565
00:44:53,747 --> 00:44:56,082
It wasn't always fun.

566
00:44:56,166 --> 00:45:00,461
Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,

567
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:05,633
or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...

568
00:45:05,718 --> 00:45:07,719
Get down! Shut up!

569
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:10,138
...so we did.

570
00:45:27,698 --> 00:45:29,866
Now, I don't know much about anything,

571
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:33,786
but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.

572
00:45:33,871 --> 00:45:36,581
There was Dallas, from Phoenix,

573
00:45:38,292 --> 00:45:41,085
Cleveland, he was from Detroit.

574
00:45:41,211 --> 00:45:43,588
Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

575
00:45:43,714 --> 00:45:45,882
Man, what the hell's going on?

576
00:45:45,966 --> 00:45:50,303
And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.

577
00:45:50,387 --> 00:45:51,929
Nothing.

578
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,561
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

579
00:45:58,646 --> 00:46:02,357
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

580
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:04,233
Come on, move out.

581
00:46:06,278 --> 00:46:08,696
Step it up. Look alive out there.

582
00:46:08,781 --> 00:46:13,117
The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.

583
00:46:13,243 --> 00:46:14,619
Fire in the hole!

584
00:46:18,082 --> 00:46:20,416
Gump, check out that hole.

585
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:23,502
And there was always something to do.

586
00:46:23,586 --> 00:46:26,755
- Mount them up.
- Spread out! Cover his back.

587
00:46:31,803 --> 00:46:37,432
One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.

588
00:46:38,434 --> 00:46:41,311
We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:

589
00:46:41,437 --> 00:46:43,980
Little bitty stinging rain,

590
00:46:44,691 --> 00:46:47,359
and big old fat rain,

591
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:50,529
rain that flew in sideways.

592
00:46:50,613 --> 00:46:54,658
And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.

593
00:46:56,452 --> 00:46:58,829
Shoot, it even rained at night.

594
00:46:59,872 --> 00:47:02,332
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

595
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:05,752
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

596
00:47:05,837 --> 00:47:09,673
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

597
00:47:10,633 --> 00:47:14,094
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

598
00:47:14,178 --> 00:47:16,680
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

599
00:47:16,806 --> 00:47:18,682
like brothers and stuff.

600
00:47:20,643 --> 00:47:24,312
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

601
00:47:24,397 --> 00:47:27,399
I got a very important question
to ask you.

602
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:32,988
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

603
00:47:34,157 --> 00:47:35,782
Okay.

604
00:47:35,867 --> 00:47:39,327
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

605
00:47:39,412 --> 00:47:42,205
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

606
00:47:42,331 --> 00:47:45,625
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

607
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:48,003
We ain't got to pay no rent.

608
00:47:48,087 --> 00:47:50,172
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

609
00:47:50,256 --> 00:47:54,509
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

610
00:47:54,594 --> 00:47:58,180
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

611
00:47:59,724 --> 00:48:01,516
That's a fine idea.

612
00:48:02,602 --> 00:48:04,728
Bubba did have a fine idea.

613
00:48:08,524 --> 00:48:11,610
I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.

614
00:48:12,403 --> 00:48:15,614
I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.

615
00:48:15,698 --> 00:48:20,702
I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,

616
00:48:20,787 --> 00:48:23,538
and told her
how I thought about her always,

617
00:48:24,874 --> 00:48:27,834
and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her

618
00:48:27,919 --> 00:48:30,420
just as soon as she had the time.

619
00:48:32,298 --> 00:48:34,800
I'd always let her know that I was okay.

620
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:41,264
Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump."

621
00:48:56,112 --> 00:48:59,865
This one day, we was out walking,
like always,

622
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:02,910
and then, just like that,

623
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:07,248
somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.

624
00:49:10,252 --> 00:49:12,086
Ambush!

625
00:49:12,587 --> 00:49:13,963
Take cover!

626
00:49:17,592 --> 00:49:18,759
Get down!

627
00:49:18,844 --> 00:49:20,302
Get the sixty!

628
00:49:23,473 --> 00:49:25,558
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

629
00:49:25,642 --> 00:49:27,768
Forrest, you okay?

630
00:49:30,981 --> 00:49:33,607
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

631
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,569
Medic, we got a man down!

632
00:49:36,653 --> 00:49:39,613
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

633
00:49:40,323 --> 00:49:43,659
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

634
00:49:43,785 --> 00:49:47,288
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

635
00:49:47,956 --> 00:49:49,748
Misfire! Misfire!

636
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,128
God damn it! Mac!

637
00:49:55,088 --> 00:49:58,507
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

638
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:00,634
Jesus!

639
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,970
My unit is down hard and hurting!

640
00:50:03,096 --> 00:50:06,640
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

641
00:50:07,434 --> 00:50:09,393
Pull back! Pull back!

642
00:50:09,477 --> 00:50:11,604
Run! Run, Forrest!

643
00:50:11,688 --> 00:50:14,023
- Pull back!
- Forrest, Forrest!

644
00:50:14,149 --> 00:50:16,734
Run, man! Run!

645
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:18,611
Pull back! Run!

646
00:50:20,447 --> 00:50:22,656
Run, God damn it, run!

647
00:50:43,845 --> 00:50:48,474
Medic! Can I get a medic?

648
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:52,186
I ran and ran, just like Jenny told me to.

649
00:50:55,565 --> 00:50:59,777
I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,

650
00:50:59,861 --> 00:51:01,820
which was a bad thing.

651
00:51:02,364 --> 00:51:03,906
Bubba!

652
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:09,828
Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.

653
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:15,584
Any friendlies out there?

654
00:51:16,544 --> 00:51:18,711
Yeah, I've got three over here.

655
00:51:19,338 --> 00:51:21,339
Where the hell are you?

656
00:51:21,924 --> 00:51:23,257
Bubba?

657
00:51:24,343 --> 00:51:27,053
And on my way back to find Bubba,

658
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:29,973
well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.

659
00:51:30,057 --> 00:51:31,265
Tex!

660
00:51:33,352 --> 00:51:34,352
Okay.

661
00:51:34,436 --> 00:51:38,398
I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,

662
00:51:38,524 --> 00:51:42,402
so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.

663
00:51:57,543 --> 00:51:59,961
And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,

664
00:52:00,087 --> 00:52:03,589
somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."

665
00:52:11,265 --> 00:52:13,141
Can't hear... Can't hear...

666
00:52:15,436 --> 00:52:16,728
No sweat, man. Just lay back.

667
00:52:16,812 --> 00:52:19,313
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

668
00:52:21,316 --> 00:52:24,360
I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.

669
00:52:24,445 --> 00:52:25,695
...over.

670
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:29,073
Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

671
00:52:29,158 --> 00:52:30,992
We got Charlie all over this area.

672
00:52:31,118 --> 00:52:33,411
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

673
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:36,873
- Six, Strongarm, we want...
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

674
00:52:36,957 --> 00:52:38,166
I know he's dead!

675
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:41,127
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

676
00:52:41,253 --> 00:52:42,587
- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.
- God damn it!

677
00:52:42,671 --> 00:52:45,381
- Copy this transmission. Over.
- What are you doing?

678
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:48,801
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

679
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:51,220
Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.

680
00:52:51,305 --> 00:52:53,931
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

681
00:52:54,016 --> 00:52:57,185
Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised

682
00:52:57,311 --> 00:52:59,270
your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.

683
00:52:59,354 --> 00:53:02,774
Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.

684
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,318
Something bit me!

685
00:53:12,201 --> 00:53:14,327
You chink son of a bitch!

686
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,831
I can't leave the platoon.

687
00:53:18,957 --> 00:53:23,878
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

688
00:53:24,004 --> 00:53:26,130
Did you hear what I said?

689
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,800
God damn it, put me down!

690
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,552
Get your ass out of here!

691
00:53:34,848 --> 00:53:37,433
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

692
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:38,851
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

693
00:53:38,977 --> 00:53:40,061
To get Bubba.

694
00:53:40,187 --> 00:53:44,023
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

695
00:53:44,149 --> 00:53:46,525
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

696
00:53:46,651 --> 00:53:49,069
I gotta find Bubba!

697
00:54:05,044 --> 00:54:06,503
Forrest.

698
00:54:14,262 --> 00:54:16,930
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

699
00:54:17,723 --> 00:54:19,391
I'm okay.

700
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:29,067
Oh, Bubba, no...

701
00:54:29,193 --> 00:54:31,403
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

702
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:42,247
Come on. Come on. Come on.

703
00:54:47,253 --> 00:54:48,753
I'm okay, Forrest.

704
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:52,924
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

705
00:55:29,962 --> 00:55:33,089
Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

706
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:38,637
If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,

707
00:55:38,763 --> 00:55:41,056
I'd of thought of something better to say.

708
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,641
Hey, Bubba.

709
00:55:43,768 --> 00:55:45,143
Hey, Forrest.

710
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,690
Forrest, why'd this happen?

711
00:55:52,026 --> 00:55:53,818
You got shot.

712
00:55:55,529 --> 00:55:59,699
Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.

713
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:02,160
I wanna go home.

714
00:56:04,163 --> 00:56:06,206
Bubba was my best good friend.

715
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:11,711
And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.

716
00:56:11,837 --> 00:56:14,922
Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,

717
00:56:15,006 --> 00:56:18,968
but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.

718
00:56:24,683 --> 00:56:26,976
That's all I have to say about that.

719
00:56:29,354 --> 00:56:31,522
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

720
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:36,527
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

721
00:56:38,905 --> 00:56:40,990
Oh, yes, sir.

722
00:56:41,074 --> 00:56:44,201
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

723
00:56:44,327 --> 00:56:49,581
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

724
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:53,544
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

725
00:56:54,379 --> 00:56:57,881
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

726
00:56:58,008 --> 00:56:59,717
is the ice cream.

727
00:56:59,843 --> 00:57:02,428
They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.

728
00:57:02,554 --> 00:57:03,846
And guess what?

729
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:07,057
A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.

730
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:12,354
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

731
00:57:14,733 --> 00:57:16,900
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

732
00:57:28,621 --> 00:57:30,914
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

733
00:57:39,424 --> 00:57:40,758
Harper!

734
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:46,430
Cooper, Larson,

735
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:49,975
Webster,

736
00:57:51,394 --> 00:57:54,897
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

737
00:57:58,443 --> 00:58:01,737
Kyle, Nichols,

738
00:58:03,948 --> 00:58:09,912
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

739
00:58:11,247 --> 00:58:12,623
Holiday...

740
00:58:19,381 --> 00:58:21,632
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

741
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:27,471
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

742
00:58:27,555 --> 00:58:29,139
- From the DMZ to the Delta...
- Turn it off!

743
00:58:29,224 --> 00:58:32,476
...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.

744
00:58:32,602 --> 00:58:34,937
This is Channel 6, Saigon.

745
00:58:37,649 --> 00:58:39,316
Good catch, Gump.

746
00:58:41,276 --> 00:58:43,444
You know how to play this?

747
00:58:44,738 --> 00:58:46,823
Come on, let me show you. Here.

748
00:58:48,909 --> 00:58:51,244
Now, the secret to this game is,

749
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:57,166
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

750
00:59:00,754 --> 00:59:02,088
All right.

751
00:59:05,426 --> 00:59:09,095
For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

752
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:12,348
See? Any idiot can play.

753
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:15,601
So, I started playing it all the time.

754
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,104
I played Ping-Pong

755
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:21,482
even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.

756
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:34,203
The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,

757
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:36,164
whatever that means.

758
00:59:36,623 --> 00:59:39,876
Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.

759
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:49,260
I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.

760
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:02,148
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

761
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:05,276
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

762
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:08,070
I should have died out there
with my men,

763
01:00:08,197 --> 01:00:12,158
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

764
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:15,870
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

765
01:00:16,622 --> 01:00:17,705
Do you see that?

766
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:21,584
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

767
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:26,547
Yes, sir, I do.

768
01:00:30,219 --> 01:00:32,261
Did you hear what I said?

769
01:00:33,138 --> 01:00:34,889
You cheated me.

770
01:00:34,973 --> 01:00:36,140
I had a destiny.

771
01:00:36,225 --> 01:00:39,769
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

772
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:44,482
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

773
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,827
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

774
01:00:58,956 --> 01:01:02,333
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

775
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:06,629
I had a destiny.

776
01:01:08,589 --> 01:01:12,968
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

777
01:01:19,141 --> 01:01:21,476
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

778
01:01:44,709 --> 01:01:46,209
Look at me.

779
01:01:47,545 --> 01:01:55,218
What am I gonna do now?

780
01:02:05,605 --> 01:02:07,063
PFC Gump?

781
01:02:08,608 --> 01:02:10,025
Yes, sir!

782
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:12,193
As you were.

783
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:16,531
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

784
01:02:17,575 --> 01:02:21,202
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

785
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,713
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

786
01:02:32,632 --> 01:02:34,424
They sent him home.

787
01:02:40,431 --> 01:02:43,183
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.

788
01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:47,771
The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President

789
01:02:47,855 --> 01:02:51,232
regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.

790
01:02:51,317 --> 01:02:53,443
President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor

791
01:02:53,527 --> 01:02:55,195
to men
from each of the Armed Services.

792
01:02:55,279 --> 01:02:58,198
America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.

793
01:03:00,201 --> 01:03:03,995
I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?

794
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,248
- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.

795
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,293
I'd kind of like to see that.

796
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,892
God damn, son.

797
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,856
After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,

798
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:35,443
so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.

799
01:03:35,528 --> 01:03:38,654
Hilary, all right, I've got the vets,
what do you want me to do with them?

800
01:03:38,738 --> 01:03:40,489
What are you doing here so late?

801
01:03:40,573 --> 01:03:44,618
It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded

802
01:03:44,703 --> 01:03:47,871
with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,

803
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:50,582
and some of them people were loud
and pushy.

804
01:03:50,667 --> 01:03:53,627
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

805
01:03:54,462 --> 01:03:57,423
Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.

806
01:04:00,677 --> 01:04:02,219
Follow me, let's go!

807
01:04:04,013 --> 01:04:05,639
Come on. Let's go.

808
01:04:11,688 --> 01:04:13,272
Stand here.

809
01:04:15,734 --> 01:04:18,902
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

810
01:04:20,196 --> 01:04:21,321
Okay.

811
01:04:22,115 --> 01:04:25,492
There was this man giving a little talk.

812
01:04:25,577 --> 01:04:29,079
And for some reason, he was
wearing an American flag for a shirt.

813
01:04:29,164 --> 01:04:30,622
Now, I'm gonna
bring up some soldiers...

814
01:04:30,707 --> 01:04:33,500
And he liked to say the "F" word.

815
01:04:33,585 --> 01:04:36,962
A lot. "F" this and "F" that.

816
01:04:37,046 --> 01:04:39,381
And every time he said the "F" word,

817
01:04:39,466 --> 01:04:42,217
people, for some reason,
well, they'd cheer.

818
01:04:42,302 --> 01:04:45,387
...where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!

819
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:48,766
Yeah! Yeah!

820
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,852
Come on, man, come up here, man.

821
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:55,606
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move, move.

822
01:04:56,608 --> 01:05:00,027
You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That's it.

823
01:05:12,832 --> 01:05:15,375
Tell us a little bit about the war, man.

824
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,211
The war in Vietnam?

825
01:05:17,295 --> 01:05:20,214
- The war in Viet-fucking-nam!
- Yeah!

826
01:05:40,568 --> 01:05:41,652
Peace!

827
01:05:42,028 --> 01:05:43,403
Come on, man, go!

828
01:05:43,696 --> 01:05:45,656
- Come on!
- Peace!

829
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:46,782
Well...

830
01:05:46,866 --> 01:05:50,327
There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam.

831
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:55,249
...there's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.

832
01:05:59,045 --> 01:06:02,840
In Vietnam, your...

833
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:13,683
Hey, what the hell are you...

834
01:06:13,767 --> 01:06:16,519
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

835
01:06:16,603 --> 01:06:19,105
Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?

836
01:06:20,524 --> 01:06:22,191
We can't hear you!

837
01:06:23,902 --> 01:06:25,903
We can't hear anything!

838
01:06:26,613 --> 01:06:29,115
- This one! This one! Give me that!
- Turn it up!

839
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:30,616
Speak up!

840
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:32,869
That's it!

841
01:06:33,954 --> 01:06:36,789
...and that's all I have to say about that.

842
01:06:44,089 --> 01:06:47,049
That's so right on, man. You said it all.

843
01:06:48,552 --> 01:06:51,053
What's your name, man?

844
01:06:51,138 --> 01:06:53,764
My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

845
01:06:54,975 --> 01:06:56,142
Forrest Gump!

846
01:06:56,268 --> 01:06:57,643
- Gump!
- Gump!

847
01:06:59,146 --> 01:07:02,899
Forrest! Forrest!

848
01:07:06,945 --> 01:07:09,322
- Jenny!
- Forrest!

849
01:07:26,089 --> 01:07:28,758
Hey! Hey!

850
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:39,977
It was the happiest moment of my life.

851
01:07:42,314 --> 01:07:45,691
Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.

852
01:07:47,027 --> 01:07:48,611
She showed me around,

853
01:07:48,695 --> 01:07:51,280
and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.

854
01:07:51,365 --> 01:07:52,698
Shut that blind, man.

855
01:07:52,824 --> 01:07:55,034
And get your white ass
away from that window.

856
01:07:55,118 --> 01:07:57,203
Don't you know we in a war here?

857
01:07:58,038 --> 01:07:59,455
Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.
He's one of us.

858
01:07:59,539 --> 01:08:01,457
- Let me tell you about us.
- Where the hell have you been?

859
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:03,626
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

860
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:05,461
from the racial onslaught of the pig

861
01:08:05,545 --> 01:08:07,630
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

862
01:08:07,714 --> 01:08:11,050
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

863
01:08:13,971 --> 01:08:15,888
Who's the baby killer?

864
01:08:16,014 --> 01:08:18,724
This is my good friend I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.

865
01:08:18,809 --> 01:08:20,559
Forrest, this is Wesley.

866
01:08:20,644 --> 01:08:21,936
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,

867
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:24,647
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

868
01:08:24,731 --> 01:08:26,148
Let me tell you something else.

869
01:08:26,233 --> 01:08:30,486
We are here to offer protection and help
for all of those who need our help,

870
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:34,155
because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.

871
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,909
Yes, we are against any war where
black soldiers are sent to the frontline

872
01:08:37,994 --> 01:08:39,911
to die for a country that hates them.

873
01:08:39,996 --> 01:08:43,164
Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

874
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:46,334
and come to be brutalized and killed
in their own communities

875
01:08:46,419 --> 01:08:48,003
as they sleep in their beds at night.

876
01:08:48,087 --> 01:08:49,254
You are a fucking asshole!

877
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:52,716
Yes, we are against all these racist
and imperial dog acts.

878
01:09:02,018 --> 01:09:05,228
Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!

879
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:08,440
Forrest!

880
01:09:09,025 --> 01:09:10,775
Stop it! Stop it!

881
01:09:17,408 --> 01:09:18,783
Oh, God...

882
01:09:19,618 --> 01:09:22,037
I shouldn't have brought you here.

883
01:09:22,121 --> 01:09:25,749
I should have known it was just
gonna be some bullshit hassle.

884
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:29,544
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

885
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:36,217
Come on, Forrest.

886
01:09:41,932 --> 01:09:45,935
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

887
01:09:48,814 --> 01:09:51,149
He doesn't mean it when
he does things like this. He doesn't.

888
01:09:51,233 --> 01:09:53,568
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

889
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:57,655
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

890
01:09:59,575 --> 01:10:02,160
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

891
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:15,090
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

892
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:19,677
You look handsome in it. You do.

893
01:10:23,766 --> 01:10:25,683
- You know what?
- What?

894
01:10:29,313 --> 01:10:32,941
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

895
01:10:34,527 --> 01:10:36,277
Me, too, Forrest.

896
01:10:36,362 --> 01:10:41,032
We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talking.

897
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:46,287
She told me about
all the traveling she'd done.

898
01:10:46,372 --> 01:10:50,959
And how she'd discovered ways
to expand her mind

899
01:10:51,043 --> 01:10:54,129
and learn how to live in harmony,

900
01:10:54,213 --> 01:10:56,548
which must be out west somewhere,

901
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:58,967
'cause she made it
all the way to California.

902
01:10:59,051 --> 01:11:01,301
Try to love one another right now

903
01:11:01,386 --> 01:11:02,553
Hey!

904
01:11:03,513 --> 01:11:06,056
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

905
01:11:06,141 --> 01:11:08,016
- I'll go.
- Far out.

906
01:11:09,477 --> 01:11:12,646
It was a very special night
for the two of us.

907
01:11:14,232 --> 01:11:16,316
I didn't want it to end.

908
01:11:17,026 --> 01:11:19,528
I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

909
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:22,322
I have to, Forrest.

910
01:11:23,324 --> 01:11:24,575
Jenny?

911
01:11:26,744 --> 01:11:29,329
Things got a little out of hand.

912
01:11:29,414 --> 01:11:33,250
It's just this war
and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!

913
01:11:34,919 --> 01:11:37,713
I would never hurt you, you know that.

914
01:11:40,842 --> 01:11:42,843
You know what I think?

915
01:11:44,345 --> 01:11:49,600
I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

916
01:12:00,111 --> 01:12:05,199
Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.

917
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:17,794
I want you to have this.

918
01:12:22,467 --> 01:12:24,635
Forrest, I can't keep this.

919
01:12:26,304 --> 01:12:30,557
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

920
01:12:32,602 --> 01:12:34,770
Why are you so good to me?

921
01:12:36,272 --> 01:12:37,814
You're my girl.

922
01:12:39,817 --> 01:12:41,944
I'll always be your girl.

923
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:27,197
And just like that, she was gone,
out of my life again.

924
01:13:28,699 --> 01:13:31,033
That's one small step for man,

925
01:13:33,036 --> 01:13:35,871
one giant leap for mankind.

926
01:13:41,545 --> 01:13:44,046
I thought I was going back to Vietnam,

927
01:13:44,172 --> 01:13:47,383
but instead, they decided the best way
for me to fight the Communists

928
01:13:47,467 --> 01:13:49,093
was to play Ping-Pong.

929
01:13:49,177 --> 01:13:51,470
So, I was in the Special Services,

930
01:13:51,555 --> 01:13:54,807
traveling around the country
cheering up all them wounded veterans

931
01:13:54,891 --> 01:13:57,310
and showing them
how to play Ping-Pong.

932
01:13:57,394 --> 01:13:59,312
I was so good that some years later

933
01:13:59,396 --> 01:14:03,024
the Army decided that I should be
on the All-American Ping-Pong team.

934
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:06,068
We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China

935
01:14:06,153 --> 01:14:08,571
in like a million years,
or something like that.

936
01:14:08,697 --> 01:14:12,116
Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,

937
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,994
but all I did was play Ping-Pong.

938
01:14:15,078 --> 01:14:18,164
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity.

939
01:14:18,874 --> 01:14:21,167
Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

940
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:23,919
Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.

941
01:14:30,677 --> 01:14:32,428
Mr. Gump, have a seat.

942
01:14:34,931 --> 01:14:37,099
Forrest Gump, John Lennon.

943
01:14:37,768 --> 01:14:39,018
- Welcome home.
- You had quite a trip.

944
01:14:39,102 --> 01:14:42,438
Can you tell us, what was China like?

945
01:14:45,692 --> 01:14:50,946
In the land of China,
people hardly got nothing at all.

946
01:14:51,031 --> 01:14:52,615
No possessions?

947
01:14:55,243 --> 01:14:58,454
And in China, they never go to church.

948
01:14:59,748 --> 01:15:01,457
No religion, too?

949
01:15:03,377 --> 01:15:06,670
- Hard to imagine.
- Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

950
01:15:08,465 --> 01:15:10,841
Some years later,
that nice young man from England

951
01:15:10,926 --> 01:15:13,552
was on his way home
to see his little boy

952
01:15:13,637 --> 01:15:16,639
and was signing some autographs,

953
01:15:16,765 --> 01:15:20,726
and for no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.

954
01:15:23,772 --> 01:15:27,608
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

955
01:15:28,902 --> 01:15:30,986
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

956
01:15:33,782 --> 01:15:35,408
Lieutenant Dan!

957
01:15:35,492 --> 01:15:39,954
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor!

958
01:15:41,832 --> 01:15:43,332
Yes, sir, they surely did.

959
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:45,418
They gave you,

960
01:15:45,502 --> 01:15:49,672
an imbecile,
a moron who goes on television

961
01:15:49,756 --> 01:15:54,009
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,

962
01:15:54,678 --> 01:15:57,178
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

963
01:15:58,347 --> 01:15:59,514
Yes, sir.

964
01:16:01,684 --> 01:16:04,519
Well, then, that's just perfect!

965
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:08,773
Yeah, well,
I just got one thing to say to that.

966
01:16:08,858 --> 01:16:11,109
God damn bless America.

967
01:16:12,027 --> 01:16:13,319
Hey!

968
01:16:15,114 --> 01:16:16,448
Oh, God!

969
01:16:18,951 --> 01:16:21,369
- Oh, God!
- Lieutenant Dan!

970
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:25,248
Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel.

971
01:16:25,332 --> 01:16:27,292
And because he didn't have no legs,

972
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:30,545
he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.

973
01:16:33,424 --> 01:16:35,884
Take a right. Take a right.

974
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:41,055
Hey! Come on, already!

975
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:43,933
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

976
01:16:44,018 --> 01:16:46,561
I'm living off the government tit.

977
01:16:48,189 --> 01:16:49,564
Sucking it dry!

978
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:51,691
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind?

979
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:53,485
- I'm walking here!
- Get out of the way!

980
01:16:53,569 --> 01:16:56,154
Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go!

981
01:17:03,204 --> 01:17:06,956
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.

982
01:17:11,378 --> 01:17:14,797
You have a great year.
Hurry home and God bless you.

983
01:17:17,801 --> 01:17:20,595
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

984
01:17:22,181 --> 01:17:25,850
I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.

985
01:17:32,441 --> 01:17:35,818
That's all these cripples,
down at the VA,

986
01:17:35,903 --> 01:17:38,321
that's all they ever talk about.

987
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:42,450
Jesus this and Jesus that.

988
01:17:43,911 --> 01:17:46,204
Have I found Jesus?

989
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:49,832
They even had a priest come
and talk to me.

990
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:55,380
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

991
01:17:56,757 --> 01:17:59,050
How if I accept Jesus into my heart,

992
01:18:00,052 --> 01:18:03,846
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

993
01:18:03,931 --> 01:18:06,099
Did you hear what I said?

994
01:18:07,142 --> 01:18:11,145
Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

995
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:14,190
Well, kiss my crippled ass.

996
01:18:14,275 --> 01:18:17,652
God is listening? What a crock of shit.

997
01:18:21,323 --> 01:18:23,949
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

998
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:26,910
Oh?

999
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:33,125
Well,

1000
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:39,464
before you go, why don't you get
your ass down to the corner

1001
01:18:39,549 --> 01:18:42,050
- and get us another bottle of Ripple.
- Yes, sir.

1002
01:18:42,135 --> 01:18:47,264
We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.

1003
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:49,182
This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.

1004
01:18:49,267 --> 01:18:51,476
What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?

1005
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:53,895
- Shrimping boats.
- Shrimping boats?

1006
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:56,398
Who gives a shit
about shrimping boats?

1007
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:57,941
I gotta buy me
one of them shrimping boats,

1008
01:18:58,026 --> 01:18:59,568
soon as I have some money.

1009
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:02,487
I made me a promise to Bubba
in Vietnam

1010
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:05,282
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd go in partners.

1011
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:08,785
He'd be the captain of the
shrimping boat and I'd be his first mate.

1012
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:12,331
But now that he's dead,
that means I gotta be the captain.

1013
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:15,125
- A shrimp boat captain.
- Yes, sir.

1014
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:17,961
A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1015
01:19:19,464 --> 01:19:21,923
Now hear this!

1016
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:26,511
Private Gump here
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.

1017
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:28,680
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan,

1018
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:31,224
the day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1019
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:34,853
- I will come and be your first mate.
- Okay.

1020
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:39,274
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.

1021
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:42,361
Danny, what are
you complaining about?

1022
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:45,030
- What are you doing, hon?
- Mr. Hot Wheels.

1023
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:48,742
- Who's your friend?
- My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

1024
01:19:49,577 --> 01:19:53,789
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-Limbs Lenore.

1025
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:58,085
So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.

1026
01:19:58,169 --> 01:19:59,628
You know, you should have
been here for Christmas,

1027
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:01,046
'cause Tommy bought a round
on the house

1028
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,631
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

1029
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:05,759
Well, well, I had company.

1030
01:20:06,636 --> 01:20:10,305
Hey, hey! We was just there.
That's at Times Square.

1031
01:20:10,932 --> 01:20:15,060
Don't you just love New Year's?
You get to start all over.

1032
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:18,438
- Hey, Lenore...
- Everybody gets a second chance.

1033
01:20:18,523 --> 01:20:21,066
It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,

1034
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,443
I began to think about Jenny,

1035
01:20:24,362 --> 01:20:28,824
wondering how she was spending
her New Year's night out in California.

1036
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:54,932
...eight, seven, six, five,

1037
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:58,519
four, three, two, one!

1038
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:01,313
Happy New Year!

1039
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:20,499
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

1040
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:59,455
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

1041
01:22:00,123 --> 01:22:01,540
What's his problem?

1042
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,876
Did you lose your pecker in the war
or something?

1043
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,003
What, is your friend stupid
or something?

1044
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:07,171
What did you say?

1045
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:08,672
I said, is your friend stupid
or something?

1046
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,925
Hey! Don't call him stupid!

1047
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,968
- Hey, don't you push her!
- You shut up!

1048
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,095
- Don't you ever call him stupid!
- What's the matter, baby?

1049
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,889
- Why are you so upset?
- Just get the hell out of here.

1050
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:18,057
- Stupid damn...
- Get your goddamn clothes...

1051
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:19,642
You belong in Ripley's Believe It Or Not!

1052
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:21,602
- Get the hell out of here!
- You should be in a sideshow!

1053
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:22,728
Go on! Get out of here!

1054
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:24,104
Come on, Lenore.
We don't need this shit!

1055
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:25,564
Get out of here!

1056
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:29,735
- You retard.
- Loser. You freak.

1057
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,325
No, no.

1058
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:05,437
I'm sorry I ruined your
New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

1059
01:23:06,022 --> 01:23:08,315
She tasted like cigarettes.

1060
01:23:24,498 --> 01:23:29,002
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's
some things you just can't change.

1061
01:23:29,086 --> 01:23:34,215
He didn't want to be called crippled,
just like I didn't want to be called stupid.

1062
01:23:39,722 --> 01:23:41,598
Happy New Year, Gump.

1063
01:23:46,395 --> 01:23:47,770
The US Ping-Pong team

1064
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:50,148
met with President Nixon today
at an Oval Office ceremony...

1065
01:23:50,232 --> 01:23:52,984
And wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

1066
01:23:53,068 --> 01:23:57,030
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.

1067
01:23:57,114 --> 01:23:59,365
So, I went, again.

1068
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,661
And I met the President
of the United States, again.

1069
01:24:04,413 --> 01:24:07,373
Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.

1070
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:10,835
So, are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?

1071
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,922
- Yes, sir.
- Well, where are you staying?

1072
01:24:14,006 --> 01:24:16,633
- It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1073
01:24:16,717 --> 01:24:19,844
I know of a much nicer hotel.
It's brand-new, very modern.

1074
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:21,930
I'll have my people
take care of it for you.

1075
01:24:22,556 --> 01:24:23,681
Security, Frank Wills.

1076
01:24:23,766 --> 01:24:27,352
Yeah, sir, you might want
to send a maintenance man

1077
01:24:27,436 --> 01:24:30,104
over to that office across the way.

1078
01:24:30,189 --> 01:24:33,066
The lights are off, and they must be
looking for a fuse box or something,

1079
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:35,860
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1080
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:37,570
Okay, sir. I'll check it out.

1081
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:39,364
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1082
01:24:39,448 --> 01:24:41,366
- Good night.
- Good night.

1083
01:24:44,995 --> 01:24:50,375
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.

1084
01:24:50,459 --> 01:24:52,502
Vice President Ford

1085
01:24:52,586 --> 01:24:57,090
will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.

1086
01:24:58,467 --> 01:25:03,262
As I recall the high hopes for America
with which we began this second term...

1087
01:25:08,519 --> 01:25:10,061
Sergeant Gump.

1088
01:25:10,562 --> 01:25:12,772
- Yes, sir!
- As you were.

1089
01:25:12,856 --> 01:25:15,984
I have your discharge papers.
Your service is up, son.

1090
01:25:19,405 --> 01:25:22,156
Does this mean
I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1091
01:25:22,241 --> 01:25:24,200
For the Army it does.

1092
01:25:26,829 --> 01:25:31,708
And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.

1093
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,798
So, I went home.

1094
01:26:00,278 --> 01:26:03,697
- I'm home, Mama.
- I know, I know.

1095
01:26:05,324 --> 01:26:06,867
- Louise, he's here.
- Now, when I got home,

1096
01:26:06,951 --> 01:26:10,996
I had no idea,
but Mama had had all sorts of visitors.

1097
01:26:11,122 --> 01:26:13,415
We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.

1098
01:26:13,499 --> 01:26:16,585
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1099
01:26:16,669 --> 01:26:20,464
One man even left a check for $25,000

1100
01:26:20,548 --> 01:26:24,009
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you liked using their paddle.

1101
01:26:24,135 --> 01:26:26,803
Oh, but, Mama,
I only like using my own paddle.

1102
01:26:26,888 --> 01:26:28,889
- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.

1103
01:26:28,973 --> 01:26:31,892
I know that. I know that.

1104
01:26:31,976 --> 01:26:34,644
But it's $25,000, Forrest.

1105
01:26:34,729 --> 01:26:39,399
I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you.

1106
01:26:39,484 --> 01:26:41,610
- Oh, you look good, Forrest.
- That Mama, she sure was right.

1107
01:26:41,694 --> 01:26:44,196
- You look real good.
- It's funny how things work out.

1108
01:26:44,322 --> 01:26:47,449
I didn't stay home for long,
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,

1109
01:26:47,533 --> 01:26:49,785
and I always try to keep my promise.

1110
01:26:49,869 --> 01:26:51,411
So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre

1111
01:26:51,496 --> 01:26:55,248
to meet Bubba's family
and make their introduction.

1112
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:59,002
Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

1113
01:26:59,712 --> 01:27:01,963
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1114
01:27:02,048 --> 01:27:03,423
I guess.

1115
01:27:04,425 --> 01:27:08,011
And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.

1116
01:27:10,014 --> 01:27:12,557
Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump.

1117
01:27:15,686 --> 01:27:19,731
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

1118
01:27:22,527 --> 01:27:29,324
I'm taking the $24,562
and 47 cents that I got...

1119
01:27:30,409 --> 01:27:33,995
Or, that's left after a new hair cut
and a new suit,

1120
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,039
and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,

1121
01:27:36,124 --> 01:27:39,376
and I bought a bus ticket
and three Dr. Peppers.

1122
01:27:39,919 --> 01:27:41,711
Tell me something.

1123
01:27:42,755 --> 01:27:44,881
Are you stupid or something?

1124
01:27:44,966 --> 01:27:47,008
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1125
01:27:47,093 --> 01:27:50,053
Well, that's what's left after me saying,

1126
01:27:50,972 --> 01:27:53,098
"When I was in China
on the All-America Ping-Pong team,

1127
01:27:53,224 --> 01:27:57,018
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong with
my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,"

1128
01:27:57,103 --> 01:27:58,353
which everybody knows isn't true,

1129
01:27:58,437 --> 01:27:59,813
but Mama says it's just a little white lie

1130
01:27:59,897 --> 01:28:02,065
so it wouldn't hurt nobody.

1131
01:28:03,484 --> 01:28:09,406
So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,
ropes and new nets

1132
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:11,908
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1133
01:28:33,597 --> 01:28:36,849
Now, Bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping,

1134
01:28:36,933 --> 01:28:39,268
but you know what I found out?

1135
01:28:40,937 --> 01:28:43,272
Shrimping is tough.

1136
01:28:45,483 --> 01:28:47,318
I only caught five.

1137
01:28:47,444 --> 01:28:50,779
A couple more,
you could have yourself a cocktail.

1138
01:28:54,117 --> 01:28:55,868
Hey, you ever think
about naming this old boat?

1139
01:28:55,952 --> 01:28:58,621
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

1140
01:29:00,999 --> 01:29:05,836
I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one I could think of,

1141
01:29:07,005 --> 01:29:10,216
the most beautiful name
in the wide world.

1142
01:29:31,238 --> 01:29:34,073
Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,

1143
01:29:34,157 --> 01:29:36,700
but I thought about her a lot,

1144
01:29:36,826 --> 01:29:40,287
and I hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy.

1145
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,103
I thought about Jenny all the time.

1146
01:31:53,754 --> 01:31:54,921
Hey!

1147
01:32:18,779 --> 01:32:23,449
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1148
01:32:23,534 --> 01:32:27,453
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1149
01:32:27,538 --> 01:32:31,290
But you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1150
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:33,668
Yes, I know that.

1151
01:32:34,002 --> 01:32:36,045
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1152
01:32:36,171 --> 01:32:40,716
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

1153
01:32:42,344 --> 01:32:49,225
And I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain

1154
01:32:49,351 --> 01:32:51,936
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.

1155
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:55,148
- I am a man of my word.
- Okay.

1156
01:32:55,232 --> 01:32:59,235
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1157
01:32:59,361 --> 01:33:00,695
No, sir.

1158
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:11,872
That's my boat.

1159
01:33:14,459 --> 01:33:19,921
I have a feeling if we head due east,
we'll find some shrimp,

1160
01:33:20,047 --> 01:33:21,631
so take a left.

1161
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:25,969
- Take a left!
- Which way?

1162
01:33:26,053 --> 01:33:28,722
Over there! They're over there!

1163
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:33,226
- Get on the wheel and take a left!
- Okay.

1164
01:33:34,437 --> 01:33:38,565
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

1165
01:33:40,943 --> 01:33:44,571
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1166
01:33:46,157 --> 01:33:47,741
That's where we'll find them.

1167
01:34:00,421 --> 01:34:04,549
- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
- Okay, so I was wrong.

1168
01:34:05,259 --> 01:34:08,470
How are we going to find them?

1169
01:34:08,596 --> 01:34:11,097
Well, maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1170
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:20,398
So, I went to church every Sunday.

1171
01:34:21,651 --> 01:34:23,652
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

1172
01:34:23,778 --> 01:34:26,780
though I think
he left the praying up to me.

1173
01:34:42,255 --> 01:34:46,633
- No shrimp.
- Where the hell's this God of yours?

1174
01:34:47,468 --> 01:34:53,181
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then, God showed up.

1175
01:35:10,032 --> 01:35:14,869
- You'll never sink this boat!
- Now, me, I was scared,

1176
01:35:14,996 --> 01:35:18,039
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

1177
01:35:18,165 --> 01:35:19,499
Come on!

1178
01:35:22,628 --> 01:35:27,841
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1179
01:35:29,969 --> 01:35:34,347
It's time for a showdown! You and me!

1180
01:35:34,473 --> 01:35:38,351
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1181
01:35:40,145 --> 01:35:44,023
You'll never sink this boat!

1182
01:35:46,067 --> 01:35:48,235
Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,

1183
01:35:48,361 --> 01:35:50,904
destroying nearly everything in its path.

1184
01:35:51,031 --> 01:35:53,532
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

1185
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:56,076
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

1186
01:35:56,161 --> 01:36:00,039
has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.

1187
01:36:00,165 --> 01:36:03,292
Speaking with local officials,
this reporter has learned,

1188
01:36:03,376 --> 01:36:06,837
in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.

1189
01:36:07,213 --> 01:36:09,840
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1190
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:12,551
After that, shrimping was easy.

1191
01:36:18,224 --> 01:36:21,352
Since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktails

1192
01:36:21,436 --> 01:36:25,564
and barbecues and all,
and we were the only boat left standing,

1193
01:36:25,732 --> 01:36:28,984
Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got.

1194
01:36:29,069 --> 01:36:33,656
We got a whole bunch of boats,
12 Jennys,

1195
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:37,242
a big old warehouse. We even have
hats that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

1196
01:36:37,577 --> 01:36:40,871
Bubba-Gump Shrimp.
It's a household name.

1197
01:36:41,081 --> 01:36:42,790
Hold on there, boy.

1198
01:36:42,916 --> 01:36:47,461
Are you telling me you're the owner of
the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1199
01:36:47,587 --> 01:36:50,589
Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1200
01:36:52,217 --> 01:36:56,261
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
but that tops them all.

1201
01:36:58,973 --> 01:37:01,767
We was sitting next to a millionaire.

1202
01:37:05,271 --> 01:37:09,900
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

1203
01:37:10,318 --> 01:37:14,947
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

1204
01:37:16,658 --> 01:37:19,326
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1205
01:37:19,452 --> 01:37:20,953
Well, yes, I would.

1206
01:37:26,167 --> 01:37:28,210
That's him right there.

1207
01:37:30,338 --> 01:37:32,589
And let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan...

1208
01:37:33,758 --> 01:37:34,800
Forrest,

1209
01:37:40,348 --> 01:37:43,142
I never thanked you for saving my life.

1210
01:38:09,168 --> 01:38:15,465
He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.

1211
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:25,349
For the second time in 17 days,

1212
01:38:25,476 --> 01:38:28,936
President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.

1213
01:38:29,021 --> 01:38:30,313
Base to Jenny 1.

1214
01:38:30,397 --> 01:38:33,900
- Base to Jenny 1.
- Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

1215
01:38:33,984 --> 01:38:35,485
Forrest has a phone call.

1216
01:38:35,569 --> 01:38:38,070
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

1217
01:38:38,155 --> 01:38:41,532
- He is indisposed at the moment.
- His mama's sick.

1218
01:39:02,221 --> 01:39:04,597
- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.

1219
01:39:07,434 --> 01:39:09,393
Hi, Forrest.

1220
01:39:10,354 --> 01:39:12,897
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

1221
01:39:19,571 --> 01:39:22,740
We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1222
01:39:34,086 --> 01:39:38,047
- What's the matter, Mama?
- I'm dying, Forrest.

1223
01:39:41,385 --> 01:39:43,761
Come on in, sit down over here.

1224
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:01,612
- Why are you dying, Mama?
- It's my time.

1225
01:40:02,614 --> 01:40:04,490
It's just my time.

1226
01:40:05,951 --> 01:40:10,121
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

1227
01:40:11,748 --> 01:40:14,125
Death is just a part of life,

1228
01:40:15,127 --> 01:40:17,753
something we're all destined to do.

1229
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:23,968
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

1230
01:40:24,803 --> 01:40:28,389
- I did the best I could.
- You did good, Mama.

1231
01:40:29,182 --> 01:40:34,352
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1232
01:40:35,855 --> 01:40:39,107
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1233
01:40:42,987 --> 01:40:45,113
What's my destiny, Mama?

1234
01:40:47,283 --> 01:40:50,493
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1235
01:40:51,787 --> 01:40:54,748
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1236
01:40:54,832 --> 01:40:57,000
You never know
what you're going to get.

1237
01:40:57,126 --> 01:41:01,504
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

1238
01:41:01,589 --> 01:41:03,798
I will miss you, Forrest.

1239
01:41:05,635 --> 01:41:09,679
She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.

1240
01:41:11,182 --> 01:41:14,517
I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.

1241
01:41:17,563 --> 01:41:20,857
And that's all I have to say about that.

1242
01:41:27,698 --> 01:41:29,991
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1243
01:41:30,076 --> 01:41:32,869
There'll be another one along shortly.

1244
01:41:36,707 --> 01:41:40,293
Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero,

1245
01:41:40,378 --> 01:41:43,505
and a national celebrity,
and a shrimping boat captain,

1246
01:41:44,006 --> 01:41:47,217
and a college graduate,
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama

1247
01:41:47,343 --> 01:41:50,553
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1248
01:41:51,931 --> 01:41:55,600
So, I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,

1249
01:41:55,726 --> 01:41:58,436
though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.

1250
01:41:58,562 --> 01:42:03,149
He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.

1251
01:42:03,234 --> 01:42:04,818
And so then, I got a call from him saying

1252
01:42:04,902 --> 01:42:08,363
we don't have to worry about money
no more, and I said,

1253
01:42:08,447 --> 01:42:10,740
"That's good. One less thing."

1254
01:42:13,786 --> 01:42:17,163
Now, Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,

1255
01:42:18,416 --> 01:42:21,292
and the rest is just for showing off.

1256
01:42:21,377 --> 01:42:25,255
So, I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare gospel church,

1257
01:42:27,925 --> 01:42:32,429
and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.

1258
01:42:34,765 --> 01:42:39,310
And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1259
01:42:39,437 --> 01:42:42,063
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1260
01:42:46,277 --> 01:42:47,986
You know what?

1261
01:42:49,238 --> 01:42:52,240
She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.

1262
01:42:52,324 --> 01:42:53,950
That smells wonderful.

1263
01:42:54,785 --> 01:42:58,705
And 'cause I was a gazillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,

1264
01:42:58,789 --> 01:43:01,124
I cut that grass for free.

1265
01:43:04,919 --> 01:43:07,796
But at night time
when there was nothing to do

1266
01:43:07,881 --> 01:43:10,257
and the house was all empty,

1267
01:43:11,259 --> 01:43:13,635
I'd always think of Jenny.

1268
01:44:17,325 --> 01:44:20,494
And then, she was there.

1269
01:44:53,486 --> 01:44:56,655
- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.

1270
01:45:08,209 --> 01:45:10,836
Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1271
01:45:12,422 --> 01:45:16,091
Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,

1272
01:45:16,217 --> 01:45:19,928
or maybe it was because she was
so tired, 'cause she went to bed

1273
01:45:20,054 --> 01:45:24,016
and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.

1274
01:45:25,268 --> 01:45:27,561
It was wonderful having her home.

1275
01:45:28,897 --> 01:45:34,025
Every day we'd take a walk and
I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

1276
01:45:34,109 --> 01:45:36,652
and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,
and shrimping,

1277
01:45:36,737 --> 01:45:41,032
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.

1278
01:45:41,116 --> 01:45:44,452
Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

1279
01:46:24,618 --> 01:46:27,828
How could you do this?

1280
01:47:04,783 --> 01:47:08,119
Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.

1281
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:14,834
I never really knew why she came back,
but I didn't care.

1282
01:47:15,002 --> 01:47:19,297
It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.

1283
01:47:21,383 --> 01:47:25,720
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,

1284
01:47:27,222 --> 01:47:30,808
and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.

1285
01:47:30,892 --> 01:47:33,728
- New shoes.
- They make them just for running.

1286
01:47:38,734 --> 01:47:42,028
And she even showed me
how to dance.

1287
01:47:50,203 --> 01:47:54,415
And, well, we was like family,
Jenny and me.

1288
01:47:58,169 --> 01:48:01,087
And it was the happiest time in my life.

1289
01:48:20,733 --> 01:48:22,525
...and this Fourth is witnessing
one of the

1290
01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:25,612
largest fireworks displays
in the nation's...

1291
01:48:25,696 --> 01:48:28,615
- You done watching it?
...here in New York Harbor...

1292
01:48:28,741 --> 01:48:30,533
- I'm going to bed.
...with a spectacular display

1293
01:48:30,618 --> 01:48:33,661
of tall ships earlier.
The Statue of Liberty...

1294
01:48:40,711 --> 01:48:42,712
Will you marry me?

1295
01:48:47,635 --> 01:48:50,595
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1296
01:48:53,265 --> 01:48:55,308
You would, Forrest.

1297
01:48:57,144 --> 01:48:59,479
But you won't marry me.

1298
01:49:01,774 --> 01:49:03,983
You don't want to marry me.

1299
01:49:07,571 --> 01:49:09,989
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1300
01:49:14,995 --> 01:49:17,122
I'm not a smart man,

1301
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:21,251
but I know what love is.

1302
01:49:58,289 --> 01:49:59,539
Jenny.

1303
01:50:01,459 --> 01:50:03,960
Forrest, I do love you.

1304
01:50:57,096 --> 01:51:00,766
- Where are you running off to?
- I'm not running.

1305
01:52:32,358 --> 01:52:37,696
That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.

1306
01:52:38,865 --> 01:52:43,285
So, I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there,

1307
01:52:43,369 --> 01:52:45,120
I thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.

1308
01:52:45,204 --> 01:52:48,457
President Carter, suffering from heat
exhaustion, fell into the arms of...

1309
01:52:48,541 --> 01:52:50,208
And when I got there,

1310
01:52:50,293 --> 01:52:54,462
I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.

1311
01:52:54,546 --> 01:52:56,964
And I figured since I'd run this far,

1312
01:52:57,049 --> 01:53:00,301
maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.

1313
01:53:00,385 --> 01:53:01,594
And that's what I did.

1314
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:04,013
I ran clear across Alabama.

1315
01:53:05,057 --> 01:53:08,225
For no particular reason,
I just kept on going.

1316
01:53:09,561 --> 01:53:11,145
I ran clear to the ocean.

1317
01:53:17,027 --> 01:53:20,196
And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1318
01:53:20,739 --> 01:53:23,574
might as well turn around
and just keep on going.

1319
01:53:27,329 --> 01:53:31,916
And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1320
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:37,421
I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.

1321
01:53:38,590 --> 01:53:43,427
When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.

1322
01:53:43,512 --> 01:53:46,555
When I had to go, you know...

1323
01:53:48,183 --> 01:53:49,350
I went.

1324
01:53:49,434 --> 01:53:52,436
And so, you just ran.

1325
01:53:54,189 --> 01:53:55,272
Yeah.

1326
01:54:30,559 --> 01:54:35,813
I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.

1327
01:54:36,815 --> 01:54:40,317
But most of all, I thought about Jenny.

1328
01:54:41,403 --> 01:54:43,571
I thought about her a lot.

1329
01:54:44,322 --> 01:54:47,408
For more than two years now,
a man named Forrest Gump,

1330
01:54:47,492 --> 01:54:50,911
a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,

1331
01:54:50,996 --> 01:54:53,164
has been running across America.

1332
01:54:53,248 --> 01:54:55,249
Charles Cooper brings us this report.

1333
01:54:56,168 --> 01:54:58,586
For the fourth time
on his journey across America,

1334
01:54:58,670 --> 01:55:01,505
Forrest Gump,
the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,

1335
01:55:01,631 --> 01:55:04,508
is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.

1336
01:55:05,135 --> 01:55:07,178
- I'll be damned. Forrest?
- Sir, why are you running?

1337
01:55:07,262 --> 01:55:08,345
Why are you running?

1338
01:55:08,430 --> 01:55:10,014
Are you doing this for world peace?

1339
01:55:10,098 --> 01:55:11,432
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1340
01:55:11,516 --> 01:55:14,518
- Are you running for women's rights?
- Or for the environment?

1341
01:55:14,603 --> 01:55:15,603
Or for animals?

1342
01:55:15,687 --> 01:55:18,606
They just couldn't believe that
somebody would do all that running

1343
01:55:18,690 --> 01:55:20,065
for no particular reason.

1344
01:55:20,150 --> 01:55:22,108
Why are you doing this?

1345
01:55:22,193 --> 01:55:27,197
I just felt like running.

1346
01:55:27,323 --> 01:55:30,533
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

1347
01:55:31,368 --> 01:55:36,498
Now, for some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

1348
01:55:36,665 --> 01:55:38,792
I mean, it was like an alarm
went off in my head, you know?

1349
01:55:38,876 --> 01:55:40,710
I said,
"Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1350
01:55:40,836 --> 01:55:42,796
"Here's somebody
who's got it all figured out.

1351
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:46,966
"Here's somebody who has the answer."
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1352
01:55:47,051 --> 01:55:48,885
So, I got company.

1353
01:55:50,721 --> 01:55:56,559
And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.

1354
01:55:59,021 --> 01:56:02,232
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.

1355
01:56:04,026 --> 01:56:07,403
Now... Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1356
01:56:08,239 --> 01:56:10,824
but some of those people
asked me if I could help them out.

1357
01:56:11,033 --> 01:56:14,285
Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering
if you might help me, huh?

1358
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:16,120
Listen, I'm in the
bumper sticker business

1359
01:56:16,205 --> 01:56:17,956
and I've been trying
to think up a good slogan.

1360
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:21,167
And since you have been such a big
inspiration to the people around here,

1361
01:56:21,252 --> 01:56:23,169
I thought you might
be able to help me jump into...

1362
01:56:23,254 --> 01:56:26,881
Whoa, man! You just ran through
a big pile of dog shit!

1363
01:56:28,425 --> 01:56:31,094
- It happens.
- What, shit?

1364
01:56:32,596 --> 01:56:34,556
Sometimes.

1365
01:56:36,433 --> 01:56:39,102
And some years later,
I heard that that fellow

1366
01:56:39,186 --> 01:56:40,812
did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan,

1367
01:56:40,896 --> 01:56:44,107
and he made a lot of money off of it.

1368
01:56:45,568 --> 01:56:47,777
Another time, I was running along,

1369
01:56:47,903 --> 01:56:51,197
somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,

1370
01:56:51,282 --> 01:56:53,324
he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,

1371
01:56:53,409 --> 01:56:56,369
but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.

1372
01:56:56,453 --> 01:56:59,956
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

1373
01:57:04,795 --> 01:57:06,462
Have a nice day.

1374
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:09,215
Well, some years later,

1375
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:13,219
I found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.

1376
01:57:13,304 --> 01:57:15,680
He made a lot of money off of it.

1377
01:57:18,475 --> 01:57:22,896
Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.

1378
01:57:24,148 --> 01:57:25,315
My mama always said,

1379
01:57:25,399 --> 01:57:29,819
"You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on."

1380
01:57:31,488 --> 01:57:34,824
And I think that's what
my running was all about.

1381
01:57:35,659 --> 01:57:39,662
I had run for three years, two months,

1382
01:57:39,914 --> 01:57:42,248
14 days and 16 hours.

1383
01:57:57,931 --> 01:58:00,265
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1384
01:58:11,694 --> 01:58:13,445
I'm pretty tired.

1385
01:58:16,282 --> 01:58:18,325
Think I'll go home now.

1386
01:58:36,886 --> 01:58:39,346
Now what are we supposed to do?

1387
01:58:40,306 --> 01:58:44,559
And just like that,
my running days was over.

1388
01:58:46,521 --> 01:58:48,271
So, I went home to Alabama.

1389
01:58:49,065 --> 01:58:53,235
Moments ago, at 2:25 p.m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...

1390
01:58:54,988 --> 01:58:59,157
...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.

1391
01:58:59,659 --> 01:59:01,994
The President was shot in the chest,
and the assailant...

1392
01:59:02,078 --> 01:59:04,037
I picked up the mail.

1393
01:59:04,831 --> 01:59:08,667
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny,

1394
01:59:08,751 --> 01:59:13,005
wondering if I could come down
to Savannah and see her,

1395
01:59:13,089 --> 01:59:15,674
and that's what I'm doing here.

1396
01:59:15,758 --> 01:59:18,343
She saw me on TV, running.

1397
01:59:18,428 --> 01:59:22,681
I'm supposed to go on the
number nine bus to Richmond Street

1398
01:59:22,765 --> 01:59:29,688
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

1399
01:59:29,772 --> 01:59:33,442
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1400
01:59:33,568 --> 01:59:38,113
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

1401
01:59:39,949 --> 01:59:42,284
- Down that way?
- Down that way.

1402
01:59:45,288 --> 01:59:47,205
It was nice talking to you.

1403
01:59:48,249 --> 01:59:50,876
I hope everything works out for you!

1404
01:59:58,634 --> 02:00:00,302
Hey!

1405
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:02,387
Forrest!

1406
02:00:02,638 --> 02:00:05,891
How you doing? Come in, come in!

1407
02:00:05,975 --> 02:00:07,184
I got your letter.

1408
02:00:07,268 --> 02:00:09,895
I was wondering about that.

1409
02:00:11,439 --> 02:00:13,231
Is this your house?

1410
02:00:13,316 --> 02:00:16,401
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

1411
02:00:16,486 --> 02:00:20,196
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

1412
02:00:27,079 --> 02:00:29,121
- Thank you.
- I ate some.

1413
02:00:31,917 --> 02:00:37,338
Hey, I kept a scrapbook
of your clippings and everything.

1414
02:00:37,464 --> 02:00:39,090
There you are.

1415
02:00:40,842 --> 02:00:41,926
And this, I got you running.

1416
02:00:45,013 --> 02:00:47,181
I ran a long way,

1417
02:00:47,682 --> 02:00:49,517
for a long time.

1418
02:00:51,728 --> 02:00:53,229
And there...

1419
02:00:59,736 --> 02:01:03,197
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1420
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:10,037
I just I want to apologize
for anything that I ever did to you,

1421
02:01:10,163 --> 02:01:15,417
'cause I was messed up
for a long time, and...

1422
02:01:18,213 --> 02:01:19,839
- Hey.
- Hi.

1423
02:01:20,048 --> 02:01:21,048
Hey, you.

1424
02:01:22,217 --> 02:01:25,177
- This is an old friend from Alabama.
- How do you do?

1425
02:01:25,262 --> 02:01:28,347
Listen, next week my schedule changes,
so I'll be able to... But thanks...

1426
02:01:28,431 --> 02:01:30,474
No problem. Got to go, Jen,
I'm double-parked.

1427
02:01:30,559 --> 02:01:32,434
- Okay. Thanks.
- Bye.

1428
02:01:35,897 --> 02:01:38,649
This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi to him?

1429
02:01:38,733 --> 02:01:41,819
- Hello, Mr. Gump.
- Hello.

1430
02:01:41,903 --> 02:01:44,905
- Can I go watch TV now?
- Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

1431
02:01:47,742 --> 02:01:51,078
- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.

1432
02:01:53,957 --> 02:01:55,791
His name's Forrest.

1433
02:01:56,918 --> 02:01:58,252
Like me.

1434
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:02,006
I named him after his daddy.

1435
02:02:02,966 --> 02:02:05,426
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1436
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,762
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1437
02:02:23,236 --> 02:02:24,445
Hey.

1438
02:02:25,614 --> 02:02:28,490
Forrest, look at me.
Look at me, Forrest.

1439
02:02:31,077 --> 02:02:35,206
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1440
02:02:35,749 --> 02:02:37,124
Okay?

1441
02:02:41,463 --> 02:02:43,339
Isn't he beautiful?

1442
02:02:44,341 --> 02:02:47,300
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1443
02:02:51,096 --> 02:02:52,180
But...

1444
02:02:55,851 --> 02:02:58,728
Is he smart, or...

1445
02:02:58,812 --> 02:03:02,815
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1446
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:14,619
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1447
02:03:23,963 --> 02:03:26,798
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1448
02:03:49,905 --> 02:03:51,698
Forrest,

1449
02:03:53,158 --> 02:03:54,701
I'm sick.

1450
02:03:57,371 --> 02:04:00,999
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1451
02:04:01,083 --> 02:04:03,459
I have some kind of virus,

1452
02:04:03,544 --> 02:04:06,254
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1453
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:09,382
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1454
02:04:13,762 --> 02:04:16,055
You could come home with me.

1455
02:04:17,725 --> 02:04:23,396
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1456
02:04:27,735 --> 02:04:30,528
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1457
02:04:32,906 --> 02:04:35,199
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1458
02:04:40,456 --> 02:04:41,706
Okay.

1459
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:44,417
Please take your seats.

1460
02:04:48,255 --> 02:04:50,590
Forrest? It's time to start.

1461
02:05:09,985 --> 02:05:11,569
Hi.

1462
02:05:12,446 --> 02:05:13,945
Your tie.

1463
02:05:26,501 --> 02:05:45,435
Lieutenant Dan.

1464
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:47,938
Hello, Forrest.

1465
02:05:48,606 --> 02:05:51,274
You got new legs. New legs!

1466
02:05:52,485 --> 02:05:56,279
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1467
02:05:56,989 --> 02:06:00,992
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1468
02:06:04,831 --> 02:06:06,331
Magic legs.

1469
02:06:08,334 --> 02:06:12,712
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1470
02:06:15,508 --> 02:06:18,885
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1471
02:06:20,972 --> 02:06:24,182
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1472
02:06:24,559 --> 02:06:27,561
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1473
02:06:37,697 --> 02:06:41,867
Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1474
02:06:43,744 --> 02:06:47,998
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1475
02:06:49,333 --> 02:06:52,711
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1476
02:07:23,576 --> 02:07:25,452
- Hey.
- Hey.

1477
02:07:39,133 --> 02:07:40,925
Hey, Forrest.

1478
02:07:46,264 --> 02:07:48,057
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1479
02:07:49,726 --> 02:07:52,061
Yes. Well, I...

1480
02:07:53,396 --> 02:07:55,105
I don't know.

1481
02:07:55,815 --> 02:08:00,778
Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.

1482
02:08:03,907 --> 02:08:05,950
And then it was nice.

1483
02:08:09,329 --> 02:08:13,290
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1484
02:08:14,584 --> 02:08:18,462
There was always
a million sparkles on the water.

1485
02:08:20,257 --> 02:08:24,176
Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,

1486
02:08:24,302 --> 02:08:28,889
it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.

1487
02:08:31,434 --> 02:08:34,478
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1488
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:41,110
I couldn't tell where heaven stopped

1489
02:08:41,653 --> 02:08:44,029
and the earth began.

1490
02:08:45,282 --> 02:08:47,157
It was so beautiful.

1491
02:08:51,871 --> 02:08:54,957
I wish I could've been there with you.

1492
02:08:58,044 --> 02:08:59,461
You were.

1493
02:09:10,181 --> 02:09:11,640
I love you.

1494
02:09:16,021 --> 02:09:19,356
You died on a Saturday morning.

1495
02:09:21,067 --> 02:09:24,820
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1496
02:09:29,701 --> 02:09:34,538
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1497
02:09:38,668 --> 02:09:40,336
Mama

1498
02:09:41,421 --> 02:09:46,425
always said that dying was a part of life.

1499
02:09:49,846 --> 02:09:52,181
I sure wish it wasn't.

1500
02:09:54,851 --> 02:09:58,604
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1501
02:09:59,939 --> 02:10:01,023
But...

1502
02:10:01,274 --> 02:10:03,942
About to start school again soon,

1503
02:10:05,779 --> 02:10:09,572
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1504
02:10:11,742 --> 02:10:17,747
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1505
02:10:20,876 --> 02:10:23,461
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1506
02:10:24,755 --> 02:10:25,797
Okay.

1507
02:10:26,048 --> 02:10:27,215
He's really good.

1508
02:10:27,299 --> 02:10:29,425
Forrest, you go.

1509
02:10:33,639 --> 02:10:35,223
We fish a lot.

1510
02:10:38,769 --> 02:10:42,230
And every night, we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny.

1511
02:10:45,484 --> 02:10:47,735
You'd be so proud of him.

1512
02:10:49,446 --> 02:10:50,905
I am.

1513
02:10:51,949 --> 02:10:55,159
He wrote you a letter.

1514
02:10:56,745 --> 02:10:58,788
And he says I can't read it.

1515
02:10:58,914 --> 02:11:02,458
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1516
02:11:18,517 --> 02:11:19,851
Jenny,

1517
02:11:25,649 --> 02:11:28,860
I don't know if Mama was right,

1518
02:11:30,195 --> 02:11:31,696
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1519
02:11:31,822 --> 02:11:34,407
I don't know

1520
02:11:34,491 --> 02:11:38,995
if we each have a destiny,

1521
02:11:41,039 --> 02:11:46,169
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1522
02:11:50,674 --> 02:11:52,508
But I think

1523
02:11:54,386 --> 02:11:56,179
maybe it's both.

1524
02:12:00,517 --> 02:12:03,394
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1525
02:12:09,526 --> 02:12:11,527
But I miss you, Jenny.

1526
02:12:17,910 --> 02:12:22,330
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1527
02:12:57,615 --> 02:13:00,575
Here's your bus. Okay.

1528
02:13:02,245 --> 02:13:05,580
Hey. I know this.

1529
02:13:05,706 --> 02:13:08,583
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1530
02:13:08,709 --> 02:13:11,378
Grandma used to read it to you.

1531
02:13:11,462 --> 02:13:13,588
My favorite book.

1532
02:13:16,926 --> 02:13:18,426
Here we are.

1533
02:13:18,594 --> 02:13:20,053
Okay.

1534
02:13:21,764 --> 02:13:23,265
Here you go.

1535
02:13:28,145 --> 02:13:30,647
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1536
02:13:34,110 --> 02:13:37,821
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1537
02:13:39,824 --> 02:13:42,617
I'll be right here when you get back.

1538
02:13:47,164 --> 02:13:50,417
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1539
02:13:50,501 --> 02:13:54,045
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
