1
00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:20.239
Emma.

2
00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:23.736
Wake up, Emma.

3
00:02:24.752 --> 00:02:27.255
Emma. Wake up.

4
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:30.206
Momma?

5
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:31.604
Yeah. Shhh.

6
00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.876
We're going to go
chase the sunrise, ok?

7
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:35.034
Ok.

8
00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:36.491
But you have to be quiet.

9
00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:38.452
Come on, sweetie. Up, up.

10
00:02:38.477 --> 00:02:39.444
Give me your feet.

11
00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:40.533
Give me your feet.

12
00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:41.557
There you go.

13
00:02:41.582 --> 00:02:42.716
Good girl.

14
00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:44.133
Go grab your backpack.

15
00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:48.407
Come here. Come here. Come here.

16
00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:49.809
Put your backpack on.

17
00:02:50.632 --> 00:02:52.617
Don't forget your
rhino. Ok sweetie?

18
00:02:52.642 --> 00:02:54.113
Come on.

19
00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:03.400
Ok.

20
00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:04.723
Come on up.

21
00:03:04.748 --> 00:03:06.041
Here we go.

22
00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:07.627
Take off your backpack.

23
00:03:07.652 --> 00:03:09.122
Keep your rhino.

24
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:23.477
Where's Daddy?

25
00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.474
It's ok, love.

26
00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.105
It's just a girls trip, ok?

27
00:03:28.146 --> 00:03:29.262
Ok.

28
00:03:29.287 --> 00:03:30.875
You want to see the
countryside, right?

29
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.099
Where Mommy grew up?

30
00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:34.026
It's going to be great.

31
00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:35.887
It's going to be
really really great.

32
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.516
Alex, don't!

33
00:04:17.782 --> 00:04:19.619
Give me the keys!

34
00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:26.911
Come here, bug.

35
00:04:26.936 --> 00:04:27.938
Come here.

36
00:04:27.963 --> 00:04:30.450
Let's get you back inside
and give Mommy a moment.

37
00:04:46.675 --> 00:04:49.244
Shhh. You have to be quiet.

38
00:04:49.374 --> 00:04:51.827
Why? What is it?

39
00:04:52.246 --> 00:04:54.984
We're in the night forest
where it's always nighttime.

40
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.883
And when it's nighttime all
the bad feelings come out.

41
00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.157
Brrr. I feel cold.

42
00:05:00.182 --> 00:05:02.378
Maybe I should sing a
song to keep us warm.

43
00:05:02.403 --> 00:05:04.341
No. Shhh. Don't.

44
00:05:04.406 --> 00:05:06.086
The bad feelings will hear you.

45
00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:07.480
They're everywhere.

46
00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:10.485
Quick, we gotta make it
back to the castle before...

47
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.091
Ha ha ha!

48
00:05:12.116 --> 00:05:14.315
Oh no! The Mud Witch!

49
00:05:14.366 --> 00:05:16.466
I can grow anywhere!

50
00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:19.206
My dress is the ground!

51
00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.086
What were you thinking?

52
00:05:21.111 --> 00:05:22.093
Stop.

53
00:05:22.118 --> 00:05:23.507
Just stop.

54
00:05:23.532 --> 00:05:24.936
What? And leave you alone?

55
00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:28.820
Leave you alone so you can grab up
everything and yank it out of my life?

56
00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:30.315
Oh, like you care.

57
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.338
All you care about is your
writing and your career.

58
00:05:32.363 --> 00:05:34.430
Forest fairies, eat this dress!

59
00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:35.655
Yum, yum, yum!

60
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.289
Are there any bugs in it?

61
00:05:37.314 --> 00:05:38.508
Lots!

62
00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:39.828
Delicious!

63
00:05:39.853 --> 00:05:42.242
Every time I have a deadline...

64
00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:46.550
Every time I have a hard burn
you pull something like this.

65
00:05:46.782 --> 00:05:48.629
You don't see anything
I do around here?

66
00:05:48.654 --> 00:05:51.092
Stop making this about you.

67
00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:52.778
About me?

68
00:05:52.803 --> 00:05:54.874
About me?!

69
00:05:58.482 --> 00:06:00.586
You were gonna take Emma.

70
00:06:02.911 --> 00:06:04.345
Emma, sweetie.

71
00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:06.266
I thought you were playing.

72
00:06:08.004 --> 00:06:10.278
You know you shouldn't
be playing on the stairs.

73
00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:12.407
But I needed space
for the night forest.

74
00:06:14.462 --> 00:06:15.663
Come on.

75
00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:17.390
Let's get you back to bed.

76
00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.094
Here we go.

77
00:06:20.109 --> 00:06:22.210
Why was Mommy crying?

78
00:06:22.288 --> 00:06:23.906
I don't know, bug.

79
00:06:24.063 --> 00:06:25.499
It's complicated.

80
00:06:25.524 --> 00:06:28.157
Your mother is a
complicated woman.

81
00:06:28.183 --> 00:06:29.988
And she has her moments.

82
00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:32.383
And you have to yell at her?

83
00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.349
I shouldn't have yelled.

84
00:06:37.383 --> 00:06:40.047
But yelling isn't the only
thing that makes things mean.

85
00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:43.023
The important thing is
that we work through it.

86
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.875
We clean up the mess.

87
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.201
That's right.

88
00:06:46.484 --> 00:06:48.517
Family is work...

89
00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:49.913
Just like anything.

90
00:06:49.938 --> 00:06:52.265
Maybe we should
get Mommy flowers.

91
00:06:53.805 --> 00:06:55.500
Maybe we should get Mommy...

92
00:06:55.525 --> 00:06:57.394
Like, a purple flower, or...

93
00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:59.754
Some color she
hasn't seen like...

94
00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:02.532
A rainbow flower or
a unicorn flower.

95
00:07:02.557 --> 00:07:04.255
You see colors like that?

96
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.110
When I dream sometimes.

97
00:07:06.135 --> 00:07:08.073
Wish I could dream like that.

98
00:07:08.098 --> 00:07:10.164
It'd make writing my book
a heck of a lot easier.

99
00:07:10.234 --> 00:07:11.566
Tell you what...

100
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:13.394
Tomorrow, when you're
done dreaming...

101
00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:16.823
We'll go and we'll see what
we can do for Mommy, ok?

102
00:07:16.848 --> 00:07:18.317
Ok.

103
00:07:23.971 --> 00:07:25.975
I love you, Daddy.

104
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.452
Love you too.

105
00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:33.498
Goodnight, bug,

106
00:07:39.474 --> 00:07:40.943
I'll be on the couch.

107
00:07:41.818 --> 00:07:43.888
You do whatever you want to do.

108
00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:02.056
The moon is big.

109
00:08:03.269 --> 00:08:04.705
That's a full moon.

110
00:08:04.767 --> 00:08:06.469
It doesn't happen every night.

111
00:08:06.536 --> 00:08:08.773
I wish I could go there.

112
00:08:09.735 --> 00:08:11.205
You can.

113
00:08:11.548 --> 00:08:13.748
I could take one of the clouds.

114
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.759
Yeah.

115
00:08:14.784 --> 00:08:16.344
But clouds drift so...

116
00:08:16.369 --> 00:08:19.461
You need a way to make them
go where you want them to go.

117
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.450
Now...

118
00:08:21.475 --> 00:08:23.511
Close your eyes, love.

119
00:08:23.799 --> 00:08:25.569
Close your eyes.

120
00:08:26.093 --> 00:08:28.296
And float far away.

I'm done now, Alex. I'm done!

129
00:10:28.834 --> 00:10:30.892
Nice. Real nice, Sara.

130
00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:32.512
You scream and you yell.

131
00:10:32.537 --> 00:10:33.742
You poor victim!

132
00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:35.688
You treat me like garbage in
front of our own daughter!

133
00:10:35.712 --> 00:10:36.773
You push and you push...

134
00:10:36.798 --> 00:10:38.969
And I shove back and
then I'm the problem?!

135
00:10:38.994 --> 00:10:41.070
You're the one who wants
to destroy this house.

136
00:10:41.095 --> 00:10:43.429
I just want out!

137
00:10:43.454 --> 00:10:44.352
You want out?

138
00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:45.156
All right.

139
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:46.039
Fine! You want out?

140
00:10:46.064 --> 00:10:47.609
Say goodbye to the credit cards!

141
00:10:47.634 --> 00:10:49.181
Good mooch off your parents
and see how far you go!

142
00:10:49.205 --> 00:10:50.908
Sorry I'm such a burden to you!

143
00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:53.148
Sara, with everything
I've got going on...

144
00:10:53.173 --> 00:10:55.031
I cannot be responsible
for your feelings.

145
00:10:55.056 --> 00:10:56.802
Stop saying that!

146
00:10:56.827 --> 00:10:58.570
Then do something for yourself!

147
00:10:58.595 --> 00:11:01.563
I just want you to listen!

148
00:11:01.588 --> 00:11:02.687
Stop!

149
00:11:02.712 --> 00:11:04.648
No, stop!

150
00:11:06.494 --> 00:11:07.468
Emma, sweetie.

151
00:11:07.493 --> 00:11:09.594
No, I'm never going to
talk to you ever again!

152
00:12:45.818 --> 00:12:48.185
Dispatch 17-24 to
Ambulance 12-49...

153
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.412
What's your status?

154
00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:51.473
Ambulance 12-49 to Dispatch...

155
00:12:51.498 --> 00:12:52.942
We've arrived at
the residence...

156
00:12:52.967 --> 00:12:54.633
Confirming Y92.

157
00:12:54.658 --> 00:12:58.071
One female girl, five years
old, breathing but unresponsive.

158
00:12:58.096 --> 00:12:59.384
Possible head trauma.

159
00:12:59.409 --> 00:13:00.677
Both parents on scene.

160
00:13:00.702 --> 00:13:03.536
Call number 16-0-7-5.

161
00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:06.128
17-24 Dispatcher to
Ambulance 4 and medic...

162
00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:07.389
Engine 2 to scene.

163
00:13:07.414 --> 00:13:10.218
Call number 16-0-7-5.

164
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.320
Dispatch 17-24 to
Ambulance 12-49...

165
00:13:57.345 --> 00:13:59.453
What's the chief
complaint and situation?

166
00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:02.073
MS 12-49 to Dispatch...

167
00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:03.581
Proceeding with medical.

168
00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:06.023
Administering I.V.
for adrenaline boost.

169
00:15:53.865 --> 00:15:56.335
What did we do to our baby?

170
00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.629
What did we do to our baby?

171
00:16:03.376 --> 00:16:05.776
Oh god.

172
00:16:05.801 --> 00:16:07.500
It's ok, baby.

173
00:16:07.525 --> 00:16:09.303
It's ok.

174
00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:16.669
She's going to be okay.

175
00:16:16.694 --> 00:16:18.404
Is she going to be ok?

176
00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:19.661
No, no...

177
00:16:19.686 --> 00:16:21.419
One, two, three.

178
00:16:21.444 --> 00:16:22.758
Can you please be
careful with her?

179
00:16:22.782 --> 00:16:23.421
Sarah.

180
00:16:23.446 --> 00:16:24.060
Can you...

181
00:16:24.085 --> 00:16:26.053
We just need to stabilize her
neck in case there's any damage.

182
00:16:26.077 --> 00:16:27.243
She could be bleeding.

183
00:16:27.268 --> 00:16:28.771
Please, Ma'am, stay back.

184
00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:31.263
No, no, no.

185
00:16:31.288 --> 00:16:32.256
Please don't tie her down!

186
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:32.911
Sara!

187
00:16:32.936 --> 00:16:34.177
Please don't tie her down!

188
00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:35.154
Do not!

189
00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:36.458
Alex! Can you tell them!

190
00:16:36.483 --> 00:16:38.605
Mommy! Daddy! I'm here!

191
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.262
Stop it, Alex! Stop it!

192
00:16:40.287 --> 00:16:41.454
Daddy!

193
00:16:41.479 --> 00:16:42.611
I'm here!

194
00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:43.941
I'm here. Mommy!

195
00:16:43.966 --> 00:16:44.837
Listen to me...

196
00:16:44.862 --> 00:16:45.732
Sara!

197
00:16:45.757 --> 00:16:47.393
This is my baby! Stop!

198
00:16:47.417 --> 00:16:49.832
Mommy! Let them do
their job, baby.

199
00:16:49.857 --> 00:16:52.326
Let them do their job, ok?

200
00:16:53.754 --> 00:16:55.191
Mommy.

201
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:56.872
Don't cry.

202
00:16:56.952 --> 00:16:58.773
Can you put her on
her side please.

203
00:16:58.798 --> 00:16:59.919
I'm right here, Mommy.

204
00:16:59.944 --> 00:17:01.663
She likes to sleep on her side.

205
00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.191
Can you put her on
her side please?

206
00:17:04.681 --> 00:17:08.035
Alex, please tell them she
likes to sleep on her side.

207
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.091
No!

208
00:17:15.052 --> 00:17:16.824
What did we do?

209
00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.333
Emma!

210
00:19:27.746 --> 00:19:30.251
Hello?

211
00:19:30.817 --> 00:19:33.621
Is anyone there?

212
00:22:52.451 --> 00:22:53.253
Hey!

213
00:22:53.278 --> 00:22:54.019
You're ok! You're ok!

214
00:22:54.043 --> 00:22:55.293
Hey!

215
00:22:55.318 --> 00:22:56.754
Momma.

216
00:22:56.779 --> 00:22:58.446
There was something
in the water.

217
00:22:58.506 --> 00:23:00.535
Something got my leg!

218
00:23:00.864 --> 00:23:02.732
Everything's ok.
I'm right here, ok?

219
00:23:02.757 --> 00:23:03.889
Nothing got your leg.

220
00:23:03.914 --> 00:23:05.488
You're trying to stand up, bug.

221
00:23:05.513 --> 00:23:07.971
Did you feel yourself
trying to stand up?

222
00:23:07.996 --> 00:23:09.197
What I want you to do...

223
00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:10.388
I want you to kick
your feet, alright?

224
00:23:10.412 --> 00:23:11.012
Ok.

225
00:23:11.037 --> 00:23:13.099
I want you to kick your feet
through the water, alright?

226
00:23:13.123 --> 00:23:14.286
Pick your feet up.

227
00:23:14.311 --> 00:23:16.366
Now kick yourself
through the water. Ready?

228
00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:18.518
Kick your feet. Kick your feet!

229
00:23:18.543 --> 00:23:20.246
Now move your arms.
Move your arms too!

230
00:23:20.271 --> 00:23:21.607
Move your arms!

231
00:23:21.638 --> 00:23:23.160
There you go!

232
00:23:23.528 --> 00:23:25.870
Yes!

233
00:23:25.965 --> 00:23:27.055
Keep going!

234
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.582
There you go. You're
doing it, Emma!

235
00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:30.907
Look at that!

236
00:23:30.932 --> 00:23:32.665
What? What are you doing?

237
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.960
You're doing it!
Doing like a champ!

238
00:23:34.985 --> 00:23:36.753
- Daddy! Come watch me!
- Wow!

239
00:23:36.778 --> 00:23:38.379
Look at you, bug!

240
00:23:38.404 --> 00:23:39.225
You swimming on your own?

241
00:23:39.249 --> 00:23:40.018
Yeah!

242
00:23:40.043 --> 00:23:41.189
Are you holding on to her?

243
00:23:41.214 --> 00:23:42.558
Not anymore.

244
00:23:42.583 --> 00:23:44.223
There you go, buddy.

245
00:23:44.248 --> 00:23:45.326
Want to go to Daddy?

246
00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:45.917
Yeah.

247
00:23:45.942 --> 00:23:46.576
Ok.

248
00:23:46.601 --> 00:23:47.747
Ready?

249
00:23:47.772 --> 00:23:48.941
Set!

250
00:23:48.966 --> 00:23:50.536
Don't forget to kick your feet.

251
00:23:50.999 --> 00:23:51.901
Go!

252
00:23:55.455 --> 00:24:00.208
Don't forget to kick your feet.

253
00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:51.944
Emma?

254
00:26:53.514 --> 00:26:55.050
Emma?

255
00:26:55.697 --> 00:26:57.114
Hey little beauty.

256
00:26:59.717 --> 00:27:01.187
It's ok.

257
00:27:01.212 --> 00:27:02.814
Mommy's here.

258
00:27:17.744 --> 00:27:19.848
Wherever you are, Emma.

259
00:27:21.828 --> 00:27:23.297
Be strong.

260
00:27:23.415 --> 00:27:24.784
Be brave.

261
00:27:26.344 --> 00:27:28.606
It's gonna be okay.

275

Thank you, little girl.

276
00:28:55.056 --> 00:28:56.420
Again, again!

277
00:28:56.445 --> 00:28:58.782
I'm afraid you'll have to wait.

278
00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:04.157
Is it broken?

279
00:29:04.182 --> 00:29:06.006
I'm afraid so.

280
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.131
Everything can't
work all the time.

281
00:29:13.709 --> 00:29:15.379
I wish I was home right now.

282
00:29:15.404 --> 00:29:18.617
My Mommy's so sad I'm not there.

283
00:29:18.642 --> 00:29:20.772
Are you lost, little girl?

284
00:29:22.142 --> 00:29:23.756
I'm sorry to hear that.

285
00:29:24.957 --> 00:29:27.195
Can we call them?

286
00:29:27.893 --> 00:29:30.230
No, we can't call them here.

287
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.991
But I do know where you can.

288
00:29:34.359 --> 00:29:36.998
But it's far away and high up.

289
00:29:38.027 --> 00:29:40.296
How will I know
where to find it?

290
00:29:51.095 --> 00:29:54.666
If you listen just right...

291
00:29:55.153 --> 00:29:56.755
You'll hear the signal.

292
00:29:57.609 --> 00:29:59.545
You'll know it.

293
00:30:01.191 --> 00:30:03.394
If you ever get lost...

294
00:30:04.705 --> 00:30:06.608
Consider the future...

295
00:30:06.633 --> 00:30:09.771
Imagine how you get there.

296
00:30:10.372 --> 00:30:11.741
Thank you.

297
00:30:14.015 --> 00:30:14.990
Uh oh.

298
00:30:17.052 --> 00:30:18.387
You woke it up.

299
00:30:18.412 --> 00:30:19.537
You better run, little girl.

300
00:30:19.562 --> 00:30:21.178
Go. Now.

301
00:30:21.203 --> 00:30:23.072
Let me see how fast you can run.

302
00:30:31.956 --> 00:30:34.537
You sit up so straight
when I read to you

303
00:31:14.997 --> 00:31:17.659
stuffed animals and
some of your toys

304
00:31:17.684 --> 00:31:20.030
all kinds of things from home...

305
00:31:46.732 --> 00:31:48.401
I am so sorry...

306
00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:55.912
Daddy, he's been
working here too

307
00:31:57.867 --> 00:31:59.881
working so hard for us...

308
00:32:01.054 --> 00:32:02.555
I love you, sweetie.

309
00:32:50.671 --> 00:32:52.638
This way! Straight! Straight!

310
00:32:52.663 --> 00:32:54.811
Alright. Straight, alright.

311
00:32:54.836 --> 00:32:56.471
- Which way am I going?
- This way! This way!

312
00:32:56.495 --> 00:32:58.238
Why would I go
over to the wall?!

313
00:32:58.263 --> 00:33:00.997
Oh, my nose! My nose!

314
00:33:01.065 --> 00:33:02.241
Left, left, left!

315
00:33:02.266 --> 00:33:03.780
You're guiding me
into the walls.

316
00:33:03.805 --> 00:33:05.772
This way. Alright, here we go.

317
00:33:05.797 --> 00:33:07.128
Hop up here.

318
00:33:07.766 --> 00:33:09.904
Oh, you silly goose.

319
00:33:09.929 --> 00:33:11.497
You're a silly goose!

320
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:14.366
It's so dark in here.

321
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:15.936
Yeah, we're using
a lot of power.

322
00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:18.184
Just getting used to what we
can do with the new house.

323
00:33:18.209 --> 00:33:20.209
Does the house need batteries?

324
00:33:20.234 --> 00:33:22.069
The house doesn't use batteries.

325
00:33:22.094 --> 00:33:24.577
It has its own power
it draws from the city.

326
00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:25.972
Electrical power.

327
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:28.000
Like lightning.

328
00:33:32.868 --> 00:33:34.370
That kind of power.

329
00:33:35.348 --> 00:33:37.018
Sara?!

330
00:33:37.511 --> 00:33:39.548
That do anything?!

331
00:33:43.661 --> 00:33:46.465
The walls are scratching.

332
00:33:55.645 --> 00:33:57.745
The walls are scratching.

333
00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:59.773
Maybe it's a spider.

334
00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:01.658
Or maybe it's...

335
00:34:01.683 --> 00:34:03.418
Grandpa's teeth.

336
00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:06.027
And they're trapped
in the wall...

337
00:34:06.052 --> 00:34:08.473
And they're chattering around
until we come find them.

338
00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.934
It's probably just a
squirrel or a raccoon.

339
00:34:14.959 --> 00:34:17.627
Yeah, it got trapped in there
whenever the house was empty.

340
00:34:17.652 --> 00:34:19.360
Can we fix it?

341
00:34:19.385 --> 00:34:20.451
Sure.

342
00:34:20.476 --> 00:34:21.844
Of course.

343
00:34:22.236 --> 00:34:25.172
Every problem has a solution.

344
00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:27.500
Voila.

345
00:34:38.446 --> 00:34:40.651
I brought you some things.

346
00:34:41.033 --> 00:34:43.002
Just toys and a few books.

347
00:34:43.962 --> 00:34:46.198
I know you probably feel like
you're in some far off place.

348
00:34:46.222 --> 00:34:49.156
But I want you to
feel like you're home.

349
00:34:50.043 --> 00:34:52.719
The doctor said it's good
for us to talk to you.

350
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:55.139
For you to hear our voices.

351
00:34:55.881 --> 00:34:58.016
I remember when you were
just a little thing.

352
00:34:58.625 --> 00:35:00.601
And I would wonder
how you saw me.

353
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.004
A blurry shapeless thing?

354
00:35:06.768 --> 00:35:09.104
Was I a darkness?

355
00:35:09.537 --> 00:35:11.507
I always tried to
do the right thing.

356
00:35:12.253 --> 00:35:15.257
For you and for your mom.

357
00:35:15.878 --> 00:35:18.312
Every day I tried
to take care of her.

358
00:35:18.901 --> 00:35:20.604
But it's all such a mess.

359
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.992
You have this idea
of yourself...

360
00:35:26.017 --> 00:35:29.476
I'm never going to make it
to you like this, Daddy.

361
00:35:29.501 --> 00:35:31.437
How things are
going to turn out.

362
00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:32.966
And then you grow up...

363
00:35:33.627 --> 00:35:35.729
And you look around and
everything is different.

364
00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.172
I loved that it was
just me, you and Mom.

365
00:35:44.451 --> 00:35:46.318
Maybe I never showed
it the right way.

366
00:35:46.343 --> 00:35:49.305
Maybe I wasn't around as
much as I could have been.

367
00:35:52.081 --> 00:35:54.785
You brought nothing but
beauty into my life.

368
00:35:58.053 --> 00:35:59.992
You were all the good things.

369
00:36:00.794 --> 00:36:04.601
You are all the good things.

370
00:37:36.177 --> 00:37:37.679
Life doesn't stop.

371
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.203
Bills don't stop.

372
00:37:40.411 --> 00:37:42.734
I don't know our
insurance is going to...

373
00:37:55.287 --> 00:37:56.721
I'm on my way, Daddy!

374
00:37:56.746 --> 00:37:58.281
Left! Left!

375
00:38:16.528 --> 00:38:18.866
Now we're moving!

376
00:38:53.876 --> 00:38:55.311
Mommy?

377
00:38:56.694 --> 00:38:58.031
Hey sweetie.

378
00:38:58.487 --> 00:39:00.491
What are you doing?

379
00:39:01.026 --> 00:39:03.162
I'm celebrating.

380
00:39:03.617 --> 00:39:05.454
It's my birthday today.

381
00:39:05.883 --> 00:39:07.906
I didn't know it
was your birthday.

382
00:39:08.939 --> 00:39:12.100
You're losing all
of your balloons.

383
00:39:12.125 --> 00:39:14.780
I'm just watching
them dance, sweetie.

384
00:39:14.805 --> 00:39:16.537
You know when I was your age...

385
00:39:16.562 --> 00:39:18.924
I couldn't wait for my birthday.

386
00:39:18.949 --> 00:39:21.211
I looked forward
to it every year.

387
00:39:23.951 --> 00:39:26.758
Grandpa would set up
the barbecue and...

388
00:39:26.783 --> 00:39:30.195
Grandma would dress
the entire yard.

389
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:33.000
Tables with glitter,
ribbons and balloons...

390
00:39:33.025 --> 00:39:36.141
And the backyard would
just go and go and go.

391
00:39:36.502 --> 00:39:38.472
We didn't even need shoes.

392
00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.290
We just let the
grass clean our feet.

393
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:47.831
You want to go get some cake
and blow out candles for wishes?

394
00:39:47.856 --> 00:39:49.389
You know what I wish for, love?

395
00:39:49.414 --> 00:39:50.850
What?

396
00:39:50.875 --> 00:39:52.810
I wish you could
have what I had.

397
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.597
What did you have?

398
00:39:55.924 --> 00:39:58.211
The fields and the
woods and the open air.

399
00:39:59.694 --> 00:40:01.694
You want to go somewhere?

400
00:40:01.876 --> 00:40:03.512
It's okay, sweetie.

401
00:40:03.537 --> 00:40:05.407
There's nowhere to go anyway.

402
00:40:06.206 --> 00:40:07.776
Made you some tea.

403
00:40:08.394 --> 00:40:10.156
The tea always tastes
funny when you make it.

404
00:40:10.771 --> 00:40:12.808
I can't even boil water right.

405
00:40:13.275 --> 00:40:14.644
It's not about that.

406
00:40:14.691 --> 00:40:16.628
It's about the right
amount of honey.

407
00:40:17.236 --> 00:40:19.781
Mine tastes good because
it's made with love.

408
00:40:19.887 --> 00:40:21.601
Yours tastes like
you're just doing it.

409
00:40:21.626 --> 00:40:24.093
So you can get back to
whatever it is you care about.

410
00:40:24.146 --> 00:40:26.636
I didn't create a deadline
to annoy you, Sara.

411
00:40:27.606 --> 00:40:29.848
No, you do your job,
and I'll do mine.

412
00:40:31.759 --> 00:40:33.596
Hey bug.

413
00:40:36.073 --> 00:40:38.434
Take really good
care of Mommy, ok?

414
00:41:35.908 --> 00:41:37.945
And in those eyes...

415
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:39.973
I'd see all the things you'd do.

416
00:41:42.005 --> 00:41:46.880
I figured you'd either be a
rockstar or marry a rockstar.

417
00:41:48.338 --> 00:41:50.174
Bring some dirtbag home...

418
00:41:50.561 --> 00:41:53.028
And I'd have to put up with him.

419
00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:56.814
Watch him stomp his muddy
boots all over the place.

420
00:41:58.654 --> 00:42:01.425
That stuff seems so far away.

421
00:42:18.924 --> 00:42:20.460
Hello.

422
00:42:24.118 --> 00:42:27.356
It's so dark in here.

423
00:44:02.013 --> 00:44:03.783
Can you play some
music, little lady?

424
00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.757
I thought I knew you.

425
00:47:15.276 --> 00:47:16.950
You're the new maid.

426
00:47:31.585 --> 00:47:33.355
You'll have to
clean up the mess.

There's no immediate
soft tissue damage.

438
00:48:14.068 --> 00:48:16.590
At least that we can
see in the imaging.

439
00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.637
And there's no other way
to tell what's going on?

440
00:48:19.662 --> 00:48:21.099
Any other tests?

441
00:48:21.124 --> 00:48:24.395
Unfortunately we just
can't see brain function.

442
00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:25.778
And her breathing is slowing?

443
00:48:25.803 --> 00:48:27.140
That's correct.

444
00:48:27.165 --> 00:48:30.506
If her breathing continues
to deteriorate...

445
00:48:30.531 --> 00:48:32.653
Her heart could literally stop.

446
00:48:32.681 --> 00:48:33.567
Jesus.

447
00:48:33.592 --> 00:48:35.083
She's strong enough.

448
00:48:35.108 --> 00:48:37.833
I don't want one of those
things over her face.

449
00:48:37.858 --> 00:48:40.848
Sara. Please. Just
listen to him.

450
00:48:40.873 --> 00:48:42.438
There is a procedure.

451
00:48:42.463 --> 00:48:43.932
An ECMO.

452
00:48:43.957 --> 00:48:46.514
Essentially, we
funnel out her blood.

453
00:48:46.539 --> 00:48:50.202
We filter it, we oxygenate it, then
we introduce it into her system.

454
00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:56.509
The new reoxygenated blood could
cause the brain to suddenly wake up.

455
00:48:56.722 --> 00:48:59.226
Ok, well that's something.

456
00:49:00.101 --> 00:49:01.569
Ok.

457
00:49:03.115 --> 00:49:04.517
Think it over.

458
00:49:09.433 --> 00:49:10.834
Don't do that.

459
00:49:10.859 --> 00:49:12.292
Don't you dare do that.

460
00:49:12.317 --> 00:49:14.003
Sara, calm down.

461
00:49:14.028 --> 00:49:15.060
You want to cut her open?

462
00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:16.448
Go ahead and try.

463
00:49:16.473 --> 00:49:18.151
But you going to have
to cut through me first.

464
00:49:18.175 --> 00:49:19.191
You want to talk about it?

465
00:49:19.215 --> 00:49:21.036
You want to have a rational
discussion about this.

466
00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.854
Oh, you can't be
nasty here, right?

467
00:49:22.879 --> 00:49:24.784
Because people might
hear you? Please.

468
00:49:24.809 --> 00:49:25.995
You want me out of here?

469
00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.620
Then you're going to
have to drag me out.

470
00:49:39.148 --> 00:49:40.717
You can help her.

471
00:49:41.697 --> 00:49:44.432
You can help her be strong
by being strong yourself.

472
00:49:45.034 --> 00:49:46.924
You need to get some sleep.

473
00:49:47.121 --> 00:49:48.320
Try to rest.

474
00:49:48.345 --> 00:49:49.680
And then what?

475
00:49:49.966 --> 00:49:52.518
Then what happens when
she's all alone in the dark?

476
00:49:53.268 --> 00:49:54.829
We can talk about what to do.

477
00:49:55.236 --> 00:49:56.739
We can be proactive.

478
00:49:58.622 --> 00:50:00.258
Consider things.

479
00:50:17.719 --> 00:50:19.755
I love you.

480
00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:22.385
More than there are
stars in the sky.

481
00:50:22.974 --> 00:50:25.581
I love you more than there
are stars in the sky.

482
00:50:27.037 --> 00:50:29.239
Mommy.

483
00:53:15.968 --> 00:53:17.438
No.

484
00:53:17.463 --> 00:53:19.699
No!

485
00:53:24.166 --> 00:53:26.109
No!

486
00:53:28.419 --> 00:53:29.889
No.

487
00:54:56.155 --> 00:54:58.360
Ha! Hack-a-doodle!

488
00:54:58.385 --> 00:55:02.243
Hack-a-doodle, knock-a-knockin!
Knock-a-doodle knock-a-knockin!

489
00:55:02.268 --> 00:55:04.273
Knock-a-doodle, knock-a-knockin.

490
00:55:06.747 --> 00:55:09.399
Momma, can you get
up and play now?

491
00:55:09.424 --> 00:55:10.641
I'm bored.

492
00:55:10.666 --> 00:55:13.078
You've been sleeping
for like ever.

493
00:55:13.103 --> 00:55:15.172
Mommy's so tired.

494
00:55:16.194 --> 00:55:18.547
Why don't you just
come cuddle me, ok?

495
00:55:21.643 --> 00:55:22.484
Ok.

496
00:55:22.509 --> 00:55:23.900
I know a game.

497
00:55:27.027 --> 00:55:29.305
But you're going to have to
close your eyes for this, love.

498
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:30.312
Ok.

499
00:55:30.337 --> 00:55:31.352
Ok?

500
00:55:32.698 --> 00:55:33.961
Ok.

501
00:55:33.986 --> 00:55:35.621
Close your eyes.

502
00:55:35.646 --> 00:55:39.523
Inside your mind I want you
to start to draw a picture.

503
00:55:39.593 --> 00:55:43.038
I want you to imagine
the most perfect day.

504
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.259
Let's start with the weather.

505
00:55:45.284 --> 00:55:47.687
Is it warm or is it cold?

506
00:55:47.712 --> 00:55:49.554
It's warm. It's warm.

507
00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:50.961
That's good.

508
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:53.617
And how does the air
feel on your arms?

509
00:55:53.652 --> 00:55:55.056
We're floating.

510
00:55:55.558 --> 00:55:57.028
Perfect.

511
00:55:57.191 --> 00:56:00.297
And when we're floating, what
do you see when you look around?

512
00:56:00.793 --> 00:56:02.826
I see a cloud boat.

513
00:56:02.851 --> 00:56:05.120
Oh, that sounds magical.

514
00:56:05.423 --> 00:56:07.158
And who's on the boat with you?

515
00:56:07.294 --> 00:56:08.863
You and me.

516
00:56:09.952 --> 00:56:11.488
And where's Daddy?

517
00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:16.874
He's not there because he
doesn't make you happy.

518
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.486
Are you ok?

519
00:56:34.319 --> 00:56:35.755
You...

520
00:56:36.348 --> 00:56:37.750
Don't blink.

521
00:56:37.998 --> 00:56:39.534
Don't smile.

522
00:56:41.849 --> 00:56:43.819
You smiled!

523
00:56:44.299 --> 00:56:46.281
You're blinking!

524
00:56:47.156 --> 00:56:49.056
You did it first!

525
00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:51.709
- You did it first!
- You did it first!

526
00:56:52.233 --> 00:56:53.098
What's that?

527
00:56:53.247 --> 00:56:54.046
Sara!

528
00:56:54.071 --> 00:56:55.439
It's Daddy.

529
00:56:55.464 --> 00:56:56.766
We gotta hide.

530
00:56:56.791 --> 00:56:58.078
Go deeper and deeper in here.

531
00:56:58.103 --> 00:56:58.984
We gotta hide.

532
00:56:59.009 --> 00:57:00.273
Come on. Go under the blankets.

533
00:57:00.298 --> 00:57:01.900
Sara!

534
00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:03.383
Sara!

535
00:57:03.416 --> 00:57:06.156
It's almost noon. Are
you still not up yet?

536
00:57:06.181 --> 00:57:07.146
Yeah, I'm...

537
00:57:07.171 --> 00:57:08.540
I'm here, Alex.

538
00:57:08.565 --> 00:57:10.267
Come on. It's not healthy.

539
00:57:11.063 --> 00:57:11.831
Get out!

540
00:57:11.916 --> 00:57:13.179
Hey!

541
00:57:44.264 --> 00:57:46.134
Daddy?

542
00:57:47.433 --> 00:57:50.850
Are you ever going
to stop working?

543
00:57:55.485 --> 00:57:57.898
Emma, I told your mother
not to let you down here.

544
00:57:58.609 --> 00:58:02.281
I've been working all day trying
to provide for you and this family.

545
00:58:03.032 --> 00:58:05.976
And I have a few extra
hours to work on my novel...

546
00:58:06.001 --> 00:58:07.536
Which is what I
really want to do.

547
00:58:07.561 --> 00:58:09.484
I just need to be left alone.

548
00:58:09.509 --> 00:58:11.078
So please...

549
00:58:11.103 --> 00:58:12.898
Please...

550
00:58:13.495 --> 00:58:15.197
Don't interrupt me.

551
01:00:57.413 --> 01:01:02.179
We who are three...

552
01:01:02.204 --> 01:01:04.101
We see it crimson.

553
01:01:04.126 --> 01:01:06.172
We see red.

554
01:01:11.865 --> 01:01:14.234
We see something.

555
01:01:15.323 --> 01:01:16.759
Something different.

556
01:01:16.784 --> 01:01:19.718
We see something long ago...

557
01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.910
A sheltered young Princess...

558
01:01:30.895 --> 01:01:35.093
Who knew nothing beyond
her castle walls.

559
01:01:35.141 --> 01:01:38.672
Birds would glide past her
window and she would say...

560
01:01:38.697 --> 01:01:43.762
If only I knew what it was
to be so alive, so free.

561
01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:46.843
Years passed slowly
for the Princess.

562
01:01:46.868 --> 01:01:51.262
Until her father and mother, the
king and queen, were struck...

563
01:01:51.287 --> 01:01:55.528
By viral intestinal tract infections
from a bad poultry epidemic which...

564
01:01:55.553 --> 01:01:58.106
Swept through the
kingdom that summer.

565
01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:03.459
Holed up in her tower, the Princess
nearly went mad with loneliness.

566
01:02:03.484 --> 01:02:07.383
Endless tears clouded her eyes.

567
01:02:07.408 --> 01:02:10.412
Darkness filled her heart.

568
01:02:10.437 --> 01:02:13.375
Her despair knew no end.

569
01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.295
Until one day she heard
something down in the courtyard.

570
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.740
A sound so free it
shook something loose.

571
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.709
The sound of children.

572
01:02:30.533 --> 01:02:34.766
And at once the Princess knew
what would cure her loneliness.

573
01:02:35.445 --> 01:02:38.578
To become a human child.

574
01:02:38.896 --> 01:02:41.844
The Princess sent for
her five best scouts.

575
01:02:41.981 --> 01:02:45.897
Bring me the most powerful
witch in all the kingdom!

576
01:02:45.922 --> 01:02:51.150
The scouts roamed the land,
scouring the rims of the kingdom...

577
01:02:51.175 --> 01:02:56.758
Until one morning, they came
across some magical great Crane.

578
01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:00.477
Bah! the Crane boomed.

579
01:03:02.273 --> 01:03:06.203
For years I have searched for a
place where no one would find me.

580
01:03:06.228 --> 01:03:09.407
Who disturbs my solitude?

581
01:03:11.105 --> 01:03:15.133
The scouts dragged the magical
great Crane before the Princess.

582
01:03:19.288 --> 01:03:21.985
And from the
Crane's severed head

583
01:03:22.354 --> 01:03:25.071
perched on its dead tongue

584
01:03:25.741 --> 01:03:29.391
sat a golden
shimmering Witch Toad.

585
01:03:30.544 --> 01:03:34.078
The Witch Toad gazed into
the Princess's heart.

586
01:03:34.691 --> 01:03:38.463
And knew her one true desire.

587
01:03:42.148 --> 01:03:45.289
Each child in the
kingdom fell silent.

588
01:03:46.937 --> 01:03:49.438
Their bright, shining spirit...

589
01:03:49.985 --> 01:03:51.946
Stolen.

590
01:04:03.402 --> 01:04:07.563
With each passing day the
Princess's hunger for children grew.

591
01:04:09.464 --> 01:04:12.201
And without the
singsong of children

592
01:04:12.226 --> 01:04:17.032
the kingdom faded into a
gray and lifeless place.

593
01:04:52.466 --> 01:04:59.000
And for the first time in her
life the Princess felt light,

594
01:04:59.555 --> 01:05:01.358
and free.

595
01:05:02.289 --> 01:05:04.889
Like a feather on the wind.

596
01:05:09.298 --> 01:05:11.827
But then time passed.

597
01:05:11.852 --> 01:05:13.321
First days

598
01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:15.090
weeks

599
01:05:15.366 --> 01:05:17.003
years.

600
01:05:17.074 --> 01:05:23.062
Every night the Princess found herself
sitting alone in her tallest tower...

601
01:05:23.087 --> 01:05:25.507
Not daring to speak.

602
01:05:25.532 --> 01:05:30.961
Instead she patiently listened
for one sound of happiness

603
01:05:30.986 --> 01:05:33.321
one sound of life.

604
01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:37.140
It was a sound which never came.

605
01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.272
Hey.

606
01:05:47.859 --> 01:05:50.181
Can you help me?

607
01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:16.170
It's ok.

608
01:06:16.195 --> 01:06:17.764
Come on.

609
01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:42.647
Wait here. I'm going
to go get my radio.

610
01:06:55.226 --> 01:06:57.195
Emma, sweetie?

611
01:06:58.072 --> 01:07:00.007
I'm so sorry I couldn't...

612
01:07:02.094 --> 01:07:03.723
I couldn't be there.

613
01:07:06.937 --> 01:07:09.677
Everyone is trying so hard here.

614
01:07:12.666 --> 01:07:14.100
All the doctors.

615
01:07:14.189 --> 01:07:15.557
Everybody.

616
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:29.974
Sometimes I think he's just
telling us what we want to hear.

617
01:07:31.994 --> 01:07:34.208
They were hoping
you would wake up.

618
01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:36.724
That the procedure would work.

619
01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:43.763
But the doctors are
seeing any change.

620
01:07:45.193 --> 01:07:46.495
I knew they wouldn't.

621
01:07:49.844 --> 01:07:51.755
But I know how strong you are.

622
01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:53.791
And I know deep in my bones

623
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:56.205
that as much as we do here

624
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:58.018
it's up to you.

625
01:07:58.043 --> 01:08:00.658
You have to find a
way out of the dark.

626
01:08:01.037 --> 01:08:04.080
And when you do, I'll be here.

627
01:08:37.868 --> 01:08:40.229
Come follow me.

628
01:10:58.292 --> 01:11:00.394
Emma, listen to me.

629
01:11:00.419 --> 01:11:01.785
Just pull yourself up.

630
01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:03.914
Pull. Pull yourself up.

631
01:11:03.939 --> 01:11:05.536
Don't use me. You can do it.

632
01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:06.442
You can do it.

633
01:11:06.467 --> 01:11:07.499
Come on. You can.

634
01:11:07.528 --> 01:11:08.801
No, I can't. I'm letting go.

635
01:11:08.826 --> 01:11:10.372
No, no!

636
01:11:10.397 --> 01:11:11.595
You got it. Emma.

637
01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.411
Emma, you got it.

638
01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:16.259
I'm going to let go and you're
going to climb up all by yourself.

639
01:11:16.284 --> 01:11:17.856
All right. I'm going to let go.

640
01:11:17.881 --> 01:11:19.050
But you're gotta pull.

641
01:11:19.075 --> 01:11:20.744
Ok, pull.

642
01:11:20.769 --> 01:11:22.036
Use your own strength.

643
01:11:22.061 --> 01:11:24.504
You're doing this
all by yourself.

644
01:11:26.746 --> 01:11:28.214
You can do it.

645
01:11:29.161 --> 01:11:30.894
You can do it. That's it.

646
01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:32.319
You've got it.

647
01:11:32.344 --> 01:11:33.934
Pull.

648
01:11:34.158 --> 01:11:35.659
That's it.

649
01:11:35.684 --> 01:11:37.755
So good.

650
01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.433
Keep pulling.

651
01:11:39.458 --> 01:11:40.522
You did it!

652
01:11:40.547 --> 01:11:41.918
I see you.

653
01:11:41.943 --> 01:11:43.375
I see you. You did it.

654
01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.770
All by yourself.

655
01:11:46.056 --> 01:11:47.754
Ok. Ready? Ok?

656
01:11:47.779 --> 01:11:49.684
I got you. You did so good.

657
01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:51.608
So strong.

658
01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:53.244
So strong.

659
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:55.431
That's you.

660
01:12:23.995 --> 01:12:25.926
I know you can hear me, beauty.

661
01:12:26.264 --> 01:12:27.762
Across the stars.

662
01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.239
My voice will carry...

663
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:37.473
I miss my Mommy and Daddy.

664
01:12:38.313 --> 01:12:39.916
Where are they?

665
01:12:40.492 --> 01:12:42.864
I'm trying to call them.

666
01:12:43.421 --> 01:12:45.754
But we're floating
the other way.

667
01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:50.294
I don't think I'm ever
going to see them again.

668
01:12:50.319 --> 01:12:52.754
Ever, ever again.

669
01:12:57.142 --> 01:12:58.512
You know...

670
01:12:59.378 --> 01:13:02.747
After all the voices in
my kingdom went quiet,

671
01:13:02.772 --> 01:13:06.403
and whenever I would get
sad or feel lonely...

672
01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:11.083
I would lock myself in my room.

673
01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.664
And I would stay very still.

674
01:13:18.362 --> 01:13:22.325
And I would think about
what friends would be like

675
01:13:24.435 --> 01:13:26.471
if I had them.

676
01:13:26.496 --> 01:13:28.299
What their names would be.

677
01:13:28.754 --> 01:13:30.657
The jokes they would tell.

678
01:13:31.395 --> 01:13:33.365
What their laugh would be like.

679
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:36.411
I wanted so much to
be loved by others.

680
01:13:36.436 --> 01:13:38.870
I wanted so much to
be loved by others.

681
01:13:38.895 --> 01:13:43.004
That I never learned to
love anyone but myself.

682
01:13:43.029 --> 01:13:48.969
I never learned how my love
could bring people closer to me.

683
01:13:48.994 --> 01:13:50.758
I wish I knew more
when I was young.

684
01:13:50.783 --> 01:13:53.508
I wish I had known
more when I was young.

685
01:13:53.533 --> 01:13:56.094
I wish I had known that the
world was bigger than how I felt.

686
01:13:56.119 --> 01:13:59.023
I wish I had known that
the world was bigger

687
01:13:59.048 --> 01:14:00.685
than how I felt.

688
01:14:02.388 --> 01:14:04.820
Then there would
still be beauty.

689
01:14:08.672 --> 01:14:11.409
There would still be magic.

690
01:16:21.922 --> 01:16:24.152
Well, I suppose if you...

691
01:16:24.177 --> 01:16:24.846
Yeah.

692
01:16:24.871 --> 01:16:26.634
I mean, it's only been
two months, but...

693
01:16:26.659 --> 01:16:28.427
It's a really
interesting experience.

694
01:16:28.452 --> 01:16:29.451
Really?

695
01:16:29.476 --> 01:16:31.086
Yeah. That's what
you're calling it?

696
01:16:31.111 --> 01:16:33.047
Yeah. Interesting.
Very interesting...

697
01:16:33.072 --> 01:16:33.939
Yeah, well...

698
01:16:33.964 --> 01:16:37.172
It was such an interesting
moment. Between us.

699
01:16:37.197 --> 01:16:40.406
Thanks for coming. I
really appreciate that.

700
01:16:40.431 --> 01:16:42.849
Yeah, I would've
been there sooner

701
01:16:42.874 --> 01:16:46.129
I know you are. But you've
done it before and...

702
01:18:11.232 --> 01:18:13.133
Can you lift me?

703
01:18:13.343 --> 01:18:14.812

My love.

719
01:21:40.659 --> 01:21:42.495
I'm here.

720
01:21:45.196 --> 01:21:46.732
Emma?

721
01:21:47.834 --> 01:21:49.435
Mommy.

722
01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:50.400
My love.

723
01:21:50.425 --> 01:21:52.665
Hey, stay with me.
I'm right here.

724
01:21:53.705 --> 01:21:55.174
It's ok.

725
01:21:59.963 --> 01:22:05.961
Come on, come on, come on.

726
01:22:05.986 --> 01:22:08.465
Come on, Emma.

727
01:22:49.417 --> 01:22:52.121
I want to go home.

728
01:22:54.763 --> 01:22:56.868
I want to go home.

729
01:24:36.485 --> 01:24:37.789
It's ok, Emma.

730
01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.257
Hey, I need your help.

731
01:24:41.128 --> 01:24:43.063
I need your help.

732
01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:48.801
I want you to imagine

733
01:24:49.914 --> 01:24:51.852
the most perfect day.

734
01:24:52.195 --> 01:24:54.047
Can you do that for me?

735
01:24:54.733 --> 01:24:56.403
What does it look like?

736
01:24:59.109 --> 01:25:01.273
What does it look like, Emma?

737
01:25:03.137 --> 01:25:04.572
Emma?

738
01:25:15.595 --> 01:25:17.398
There you go.

739
01:25:18.727 --> 01:25:20.161
Stay with it.

740
01:25:20.364 --> 01:25:21.801
How does it feel?

741
01:25:21.899 --> 01:25:23.406
The most perfect day.

742
01:25:23.431 --> 01:25:24.766
Can you picture it?

743
01:25:25.108 --> 01:25:27.133
See it for what it is.

744
01:25:30.181 --> 01:25:32.350
See it for what it is.

745
01:25:43.235 --> 01:25:46.111
You're just all empty.

746
01:26:11.195 --> 01:26:14.198
Emma?

747
01:26:14.254 --> 01:26:17.290
Emma?

748
01:26:19.349 --> 01:26:23.874
I know you can still hear me.

749
01:26:29.127 --> 01:26:32.670
Focus on the details.

750
01:26:33.732 --> 01:26:36.269
The moment.

751
01:26:40.871 --> 01:26:42.808
Picture it.

752
01:26:42.833 --> 01:26:45.336
Clear as a memory.

753
01:26:45.569 --> 01:26:48.623
Clear as today.

754
01:26:49.265 --> 01:26:51.234
Now

755
01:26:51.344 --> 01:26:53.435
tell me the story

756
01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:56.163
of your perfect day.

757
01:26:59.310 --> 01:27:02.314
I'm still in my PJs.

758
01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:07.831
We get up really, really early

759
01:27:07.862 --> 01:27:10.036
before the sun is up.

760
01:27:11.156 --> 01:27:12.521
Momma?

761
01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:14.397
Yeah. Shhh.

762
01:27:14.784 --> 01:27:17.045
We're gonna go chase
the sunrise, ok?

763
01:27:18.272 --> 01:27:22.357
We have to be extra quiet because
we're the only ones awake.

764
01:27:23.348 --> 01:27:24.685
Come on up.

765
01:27:24.726 --> 01:27:25.779
Here you go.

766
01:27:25.804 --> 01:27:27.724
Take off your backpack.

767
01:27:27.749 --> 01:27:29.086
Keep your rhino.

768
01:27:30.766 --> 01:27:35.204
We get our best things
and our favorite toys,

769
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:37.331
so we can play all day.

770
01:27:56.045 --> 01:27:57.481
What?

771
01:27:58.924 --> 01:28:00.627
I look outside,

772
01:28:00.652 --> 01:28:03.156
and I can see the whole sky,

773
01:28:03.181 --> 01:28:05.292
and the full moon.

774
01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:09.240
There is a face in
it smiling at me.

775
01:28:10.358 --> 01:28:11.825
The face is happy.

776
01:28:11.850 --> 01:28:13.646
So I hum a song.

777
01:28:13.883 --> 01:28:17.147
And all the stars start dancing.

778
01:28:25.913 --> 01:28:29.328
Then the moon and stars
shine on the water.

779
01:28:30.348 --> 01:28:33.983
Twinkling like lightning bugs.

780
01:28:42.529 --> 01:28:44.866
It smells like soggy shoes.

781
01:28:44.891 --> 01:28:47.693
But that's okay cause
we're outside...

782
01:28:47.718 --> 01:28:50.593
And it's suppose to smell
like soggy shoes and things.

783
01:28:51.408 --> 01:28:54.155
We find a spot under a big tree.

784
01:28:54.315 --> 01:28:56.905
And we grow a house
out of the mud.

785
01:28:59.347 --> 01:29:02.928
You're making blueberry
tea and ice cream stones...

786
01:29:03.844 --> 01:29:06.014
While me and Daddy play.

787
01:29:07.393 --> 01:29:09.698
He never has to work.

788
01:29:09.886 --> 01:29:12.188
So we play all the time.

789
01:29:14.212 --> 01:29:18.461
And then Daddy skips a rock
all the way across the water.

790
01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:20.663
Until it hits a
toad in the mouth.

791
01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:24.499
And it burps again and again
without saying excuse me.

792
01:29:26.609 --> 01:29:30.772
And no one can find us because
we're so far in the forest.

793
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:32.444
And no one knows we're there.

794
01:29:32.469 --> 01:29:34.272
Mommy's in!

795
01:29:34.907 --> 01:29:38.211
There's nothing but magic.

796
01:29:40.338 --> 01:29:42.408
And you and Daddy

797
01:29:43.599 --> 01:29:48.327
can't stop smiling because
you're both so happy.

798
01:30:18.285 --> 01:30:21.333
And then the nighttime
knows it's over.

799
01:30:22.642 --> 01:30:25.168
So it rolls on its side and...

800
01:30:25.596 --> 01:30:28.567
Yawns itself to sleep.

801
01:30:31.718 --> 01:30:34.088
But then the sun peeks out.

802
01:30:35.454 --> 01:30:37.612
A perfect morning

803
01:30:37.637 --> 01:30:39.651
