1
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,398
I am a midwife, by the grace of God -

2
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:14,606
and I write these lines to you, Johannes.

3
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,400
I feel you are alive somewhere.

4
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,281
I feel it.

5
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,903
In this world of imperfection and sinners
I am guilty of many things.

6
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,575
But not of lack of love.

7
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,159
I shall do as we agreed and wait
for you at the Dead Man 's Cabin.

8
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,923
I will wait, even if I die.

9
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,630
I love you fore ver.

10
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,623
Take the pistol. It's loaded.

11
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,219
Shoot the prisoners.
That's the price for the trip.

12
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,345
Shoot the prisoners, damned Finn!

13
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,972
Shoot the prisoners!

14
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,304
Shoot!

15
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,602
Shoot the prisoners!

16
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,681
Shoot!

17
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,989
Stand there!
-Brothers in arms!

18
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,928
Back into the sea!

19
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,977
Faster!

20
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,683
Faster!

21
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,615
Is this where you want to die,
you silly girl?

22
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,799
Forgive me, Johannes.

23
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,388
Forgive me if I lack the strength.

24
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,843
Forgive me if I die.

25
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,001
The phone works again.

26
00:04:57,421 --> 00:05:01,960
You need to go to NäkkäIä.
- I 'm not welcome there.

27
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,089
Wi I l you m a n a g e?
-We know you.

28
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:10,132
You despise your foster mother
for helping women.

29
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,133
I 've said :

30
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:16,926
Go to Aune Näkkälä when
you need the Devil 's work done.

31
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,722
I don't kill children,
they are gifts from God.

32
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:38,246
Don't try to be better than the others.

33
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,537
Wildeye.

34
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,788
The crap of a truck's stuck,
I need to get home quick!

35
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:23,120
We been waiting for you, stepsister.

36
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,003
Why can't she midwife
the one daughter she has?

37
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,715
Lissu's calving now -

38
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:30,590
and you bloody
marsh waif will help.

39
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:33,927
You believe me, girl? Do you?

40
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:38,970
With 200,000 Germans
loping in the fields -

41
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:42,602
maidens lose their virtue
and men their cattle.

42
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:47,770
We'll push the truck going
and get down to business.

43
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,779
Wehrmacht rocks the truck.

44
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,239
What's up, Wildeye?

45
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,158
Red bastard!

46
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,120
Shut your trap, Jaakkima.

47
00:07:04,464 --> 00:07:08,207
No stutterer badmouths
my stepsister.

48
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:11,126
Heil Hitler to you.

49
00:07:11,513 --> 00:07:13,799
Need to get back home.

50
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:17,929
The midwife,
she's a coming to help us.

51
00:07:50,593 --> 00:07:52,083
Give me the horn.

52
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,676
A breech birth.

53
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,299
Sister! I've never...

54
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:03,099
Never let anyone do it from behind.

55
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:06,518
Someone's schtupped this Skolt -

56
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:09,105
and God it wasn't.

57
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,406
Shut up, Keskimölsä.

58
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:16,573
You! Water, quickly.

59
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:22,530
Heavens above!

60
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,701
Lispetti birthed a negro.

61
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:27,910
Dammit.

62
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:32,044
Saw a negro once at a fair
with a crocodile.

63
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:37,338
This negro's stuck it
in the wrong place.

64
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:41,427
You shut up, too.

65
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:49,895
Can you believe it?

66
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:53,228
My own daughter shames me so.

67
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:58,905
An actress,
she was a supposed to be.

68
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:02,161
The new Greta Garbo.

69
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:05,615
They should both die.

70
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:09,369
The mother and the kid.
-Looks like a live one.

71
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:11,537
Into the bog.

72
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:14,249
It won't see tomorrow.

73
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,294
Smells healthy, too.

74
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:21,552
Helps to begin life
in the North with a fur.

75
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:25,841
The years will strip it off.
-What lies are you writing?

76
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:31,482
What a crock of lies!
-An official document.

77
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:33,935
What? -A birth certificate.

78
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:36,607
Hell, no!

79
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:51,999
Evening. I came to take
photographs for our chronicle.

80
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:54,125
In here.

81
00:09:59,972 --> 00:10:02,509
Will you pose for the photo, too?

82
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,408
Bloody hell. Now this, too.

83
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:29,532
A photographer to witness this shame.

84
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:33,829
Not aloud! He speaks Finnish.

85
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,706
His mother's Finnish.

86
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:55,479
This man, filmmaker Johann Angelhurst.

87
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:59,103
Wants to interview you
for a magazine. -Why?

88
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:03,069
You're a midwife,
a strong woman of a new era.

89
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:07,858
Germany needs them. Finland, too.

90
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,411
Everyone's shagging and
panting in heat here.

91
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:30,129
And I go round these shitty
hovels for hard bread.

92
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:32,513
Dear God.

93
00:13:32,934 --> 00:13:35,425
If you will give me that man
and take me away from here -

94
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:37,806
I will never ask you for anything more.

95
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:41,845
I am ready to die anywhere but here.

96
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:06,501
Lispetti will try to screw that one.

97
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,630
What' she fiIming for?

98
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,842
That's the strangest thing.
He just films.

99
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:18,757
Asked me to pose, too. But hell, no.

100
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:21,600
I said yes.

101
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,847
Hurry up then. He's leaving.

102
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:29,688
Where's he going?

103
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:32,440
The Titovka Camp, tomorrow.

104
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:53,962
Still here, Wildeye?
In this den of sin?

105
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:57,295
Isn't this the house you visit
when you need something?

106
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,221
This is the house where -

107
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:02,932
friends get coffee,
the enemies lead.

108
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,941
This time, coffee.

109
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:10,060
How is it with you, Pietari's daughter?

110
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:13,811
Need to work at the camp. Titovka.

111
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:19,410
Why are you talking crazy?

112
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,112
Your father thought we can do
what we want. Became a saboteur.

113
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,503
Got himself killed!

114
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:32,632
You want that?
-Why ask here?

115
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:36,125
They decide things like that in Rovaniemi.

116
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:40,003
They won't take me.
They will check and find out -

117
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:45,764
about father, and other things.
-Poor girl, scab nose.

118
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:49,722
You want to screw that Fritz?

119
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:55,276
Forget him.

120
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,657
Help me, stepbrother.
-I can't.

121
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,329
You can. You can fix it.

122
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:09,617
I won't. It's no place for humans.

123
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,330
Anything's better than now.

124
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:19,963
Haven't you had enough
of bombs and death here?

125
00:16:40,454 --> 00:16:43,287
I know what happened to Lissu's kid.

126
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:46,156
What's that? An eagle took it.

127
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:49,785
I know where you buried it.
I gave it a proper burial.

128
00:16:50,088 --> 00:16:51,453
I can show you.

129
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:53,672
Shut your trap, Wildeye.

130
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,840
Are you stupid enough -

131
00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:06,389
to want to go to the camp?

132
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:09,729
You'll die there, come the armistice.

133
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:12,561
I am.

134
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,867
Shit. I'll fix it, then.

135
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:53,144
Promise to tell me if you see Heta?

136
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:54,898
Yes, yes.

137
00:17:56,696 --> 00:17:59,483
Been looking for her all through the war.

138
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:19,381
DO NOT FEED
THE PRISONERS OF WAR

139
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:31,724
Drive in, bootlegger.
Don't hit anything.

140
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:01,336
Try to look like -

141
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:03,960
you've worked in camps like this.

142
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:06,924
What the fug-arse are those?

143
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:08,472
My things.

144
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:11,638
You're not going to a spa, you fool.

145
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:14,887
Leave them be.

146
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:17,807
Or they'll know we've been lying.

147
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:27,359
Two ducks, one's dancing -

148
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,909
and the other looks at an onion.

149
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,494
"It's better this way. "

150
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:36,579
And then the duck, honestly -

151
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:38,751
begins to eat the onion.

152
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:45,627
Evening.

153
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:52,095
We've been waiting for you.

154
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:57,264
There' ll be reindeer soup
and klinge for supper.

155
00:19:58,526 --> 00:20:02,940
There's the telephone,
power plant and the showers.

156
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:05,820
The armoury and the food store.

157
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:10,231
In his building, the sickbay
and some other operations.

158
00:20:11,664 --> 00:20:14,736
As you can see, every corner -

159
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,405
has a tower and searchlights.

160
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:24,248
There we can see if
the little Miss tries to escape.

161
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:29,420
But that's not for you Finns.

162
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:50,448
Aleksey is an interpreter.

163
00:20:51,203 --> 00:20:54,900
Knows German, Finnish, Russian.

164
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:58,570
And some strange Finno-Ugric languages.

165
00:20:58,752 --> 00:21:02,244
I hardly learned a word for a year, myself.

166
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:04,830
Took me two years.

167
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:10,678
Play the violin for us, boy.

168
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:19,598
Please.

169
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:47,122
A Finnish nurse.

170
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:51,714
The Third Reich values you especially.

171
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:11,397
There are -

172
00:22:11,658 --> 00:22:14,070
not many soldiers here.

173
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:18,404
Trustee prisoners, volunteers, SS men.

174
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:25,324
How did you run your camps in Karelia?

175
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:29,160
How does this compare?

176
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:36,755
It's difficult to...
-That's where you were.

177
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:39,932
At the Isthmus.
-This is finer.

178
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:52,153
Leave us, please.

179
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:07,448
I should go to the sickbay.
-It's taken care of.

180
00:23:07,714 --> 00:23:11,787
Haataja, the other nurse
runs it at the moment.

181
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:14,838
Operation Kuhstall is her area.

182
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:17,921
You handle the rest of the camp,
and the animals.

183
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:22,380
Operation Kuhstall?
That's Cowshed, right?

184
00:23:22,604 --> 00:23:25,141
That's not your area, miss.

185
00:23:31,195 --> 00:23:34,608
Johann. You must take a photo of us.

186
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:49,995
I don't know how to be in a picture.

187
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:52,713
Finns and Germans -

188
00:23:52,884 --> 00:23:55,091
we are one.

189
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:38,003
I can give you a cure for the shakes.

190
00:26:38,214 --> 00:26:39,795
I've got it!

191
00:26:57,358 --> 00:26:58,973
Russian boy.

192
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:04,529
We need soft soap, lye, cleanser.

193
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,109
Make a list.

194
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:09,359
What're you doing with the drugs?

195
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,077
You hear?

196
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:15,372
The name's Aleksey Ignatenko.

197
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:17,701
I can't remember every
Russkie's name.

198
00:27:19,422 --> 00:27:21,538
Can I trust you?

199
00:27:24,177 --> 00:27:26,042
I don't know.

200
00:27:27,472 --> 00:27:30,464
I'm getting out of here. Tonight.

201
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:36,015
You can't tell me that.

202
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:45,850
I know what happens in the Cowshed.

203
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,868
The Germans will kill me soon.

204
00:27:53,914 --> 00:27:55,575
I know too much.

205
00:27:58,794 --> 00:28:00,159
Well, I don't.

206
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:04,456
Haven't been to the last ward.

207
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,300
What goes on in there?

208
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:14,713
Promise to leave the door
open for me tonight?

209
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:19,516
I'll make it look like
it's been broken down.

210
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,517
I beg you.

211
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:38,239
From my heart,
I wish you hadn't told me.

212
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:44,123
The foot must come right off.

213
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,289
Hold him still!

214
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,340
Hold him still!

215
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:56,347
And you keep your mouth shut.

216
00:29:12,993 --> 00:29:14,028
There will -

217
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:15,947
be load of bodies from the Cowshed.

218
00:29:16,246 --> 00:29:19,079
Bag them, report to me.

219
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,832
What do you do there?

220
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:31,925
Sin.

221
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,816
Masha Petrov.

222
00:30:27,317 --> 00:30:31,185
You said you know
how to bathe a man.

223
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,483
That I do.

224
00:30:37,577 --> 00:30:39,659
Shall I lie on this?

225
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,670
You have such wild eyes -

226
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:01,014
and you know your herbs.

227
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:04,009
I need to ask something.

228
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,271
I have nightmares.

229
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,018
What do you mean?

230
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:19,282
Don't remember properly.

231
00:31:19,494 --> 00:31:23,066
Flashes. Of piles of corpses.

232
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:25,159
Death.

233
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:29,622
I wake up at night and hear it.

234
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:34,247
Women's laughter, every night.

235
00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:44,382
It's the Russkies.

236
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:48,224
They play women's laughter
from enormous loudspeakers -

237
00:31:48,397 --> 00:31:50,979
to drive the enemy mad.

238
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:13,745
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

239
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:35,687
That's enough. Take her away.

240
00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:37,768
No! -What?

241
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:40,688
She's just a little girl,
she's no saboteur!

242
00:32:41,784 --> 00:32:43,649
What the hell?
-She'll be my helper.

243
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:46,778
Collects mushrooms and lichen.
I need one more hand.

244
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:50,743
Into the Cowshed.

245
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,376
All women in there! Faster!

246
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:05,254
Everyone in!

247
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:10,138
Everyone in! Faster!

248
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,699
We' I l prepare the prisoners.

249
00:33:33,877 --> 00:33:35,833
Shave the hair, delousing.

250
00:33:36,129 --> 00:33:37,994
Boil the rags properly.

251
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:40,080
Pregnant ones into quarantine.

252
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:42,716
Riisuutukaa, vaatteet tänne.

253
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:45,795
Riisuutukaa, vaatteet tänne.

254
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:53,154
Our home, our soul

255
00:34:53,706 --> 00:34:59,155
Our home, our soul...

256
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,602
What's happened?
Where' re you going?

257
00:35:59,814 --> 00:36:02,806
To a manhunt.
The Russkie boy got away.

258
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:05,357
There's a bounty on his head.

259
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:11,235
And if they catch hi m?
-He's got no chance.

260
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:15,523
They'll smell him like a wolverine,
play with him before the kill.

261
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:17,487
You mustn't kill him.

262
00:36:17,707 --> 00:36:19,447
If they bring him to the camp -

263
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:21,662
he'll dig his own grave.

264
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:26,375
Then a bullet in the neck.

265
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:30,341
That's his life like now.

266
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:35,012
I'll come with you.

267
00:36:35,307 --> 00:36:39,004
I can help him if we
get him out here alive.

268
00:36:42,857 --> 00:36:44,017
I'll get my gear.

269
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:56,715
Johannes. What are they doing?

270
00:37:56,973 --> 00:37:59,965
Removing mines. Don't worry.

271
00:38:04,355 --> 00:38:05,891
Listen.

272
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:11,013
Can you keep the boy alive
when they find him?

273
00:38:14,406 --> 00:38:16,112
I don't think so.

274
00:38:19,828 --> 00:38:20,943
Down!

275
00:39:11,713 --> 00:39:12,919
Helena!

276
00:39:13,382 --> 00:39:14,337
Helena!

277
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:29,245
I can breathe here.

278
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:31,489
In the camp, you run out of oxygen.

279
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:33,412
Have you noticed?

280
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,712
We're in the war now,
but we'll make it.

281
00:40:42,137 --> 00:40:44,002
Don't worry.

282
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:51,175
Did you have someone
to stroke you in Germany?

283
00:40:51,396 --> 00:40:53,637
Where're we going now?

284
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,521
We'll look for a shelter.

285
00:40:56,817 --> 00:40:59,433
Return to the camp when
the situation calms down.

286
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:03,351
Behind that hill is a cabin
near the Arctic Ocean.

287
00:41:03,658 --> 00:41:06,525
We'll be safe there,
perhaps get radio contact.

288
00:41:41,321 --> 00:41:44,563
Hell, no. I knows this place.

289
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,277
I'm not coming there, no.

290
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:50,322
Dead Man's Cabin, not good for me.
We'll continue.

291
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:53,158
We'll stay here.
An ordinary cabin.

292
00:41:56,293 --> 00:41:58,705
You learn these things
when men go crazy -

293
00:41:58,963 --> 00:42:00,954
because of you Fritzes
and lock up their women.

294
00:42:01,173 --> 00:42:04,336
I'm not coming in there.
This place is not on any map.

295
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,217
A man's just been killed here.
-Don't fuss.

296
00:42:07,387 --> 00:42:08,797
I know it!

297
00:42:10,182 --> 00:42:12,548
That's the Devil's den!

298
00:42:12,768 --> 00:42:15,840
I already got all the devils I need.

299
00:42:51,223 --> 00:42:53,635
Where's the Bootlegger?
I heard shouting.

300
00:42:55,685 --> 00:42:59,257
Jouni went to look for help.
Don't worry about him.

301
00:43:04,444 --> 00:43:07,277
What's that?
-My medicine.

302
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:08,896
From Gödel.

303
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,332
A beautiful trunk,
and a beautiful woman.

304
00:43:24,673 --> 00:43:27,335
That's what I found here.

305
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:34,638
Don't know about the trunk.

306
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:38,349
Don't know about the woman.

307
00:43:39,688 --> 00:43:41,349
Both are locked.

308
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:16,965
Why don't you take a picture of me?
-Why not.

309
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:21,173
You think God will see us here.

310
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:23,727
But he won't.

311
00:44:28,362 --> 00:44:30,853
I am all yours if you want me.

312
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,446
I won't touch you.

313
00:44:34,117 --> 00:44:35,823
You are a good person.

314
00:44:37,203 --> 00:44:39,364
Nothing wrong with you.

315
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:46,289
You think I'm hot-blooded?

316
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,228
Is my pussy set the right way?

317
00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:14,517
Just the way it should.
-Let me show you what you are.

318
00:45:14,824 --> 00:45:18,112
Inside me, you will see it.

319
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:27,242
What am I?
-You are...

320
00:45:27,962 --> 00:45:30,203
A good man, Johannes.

321
00:47:11,399 --> 00:47:13,811
The war has not touched you, Wildeye.

322
00:47:14,067 --> 00:47:16,524
We're at the same camp.

323
00:47:22,493 --> 00:47:24,029
What is it with you?

324
00:47:24,286 --> 00:47:26,902
Always so sad-eyed.

325
00:47:28,582 --> 00:47:30,368
We'll get married.

326
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:32,916
Get permission from Gödel.

327
00:47:33,879 --> 00:47:35,665
Or Hitler himself.

328
00:47:35,964 --> 00:47:38,831
I'm not going back to that camp.

329
00:47:41,512 --> 00:47:45,630
Here, I can sleep.
It's not on any map.

330
00:47:47,726 --> 00:47:49,887
It's just us here.

331
00:47:54,316 --> 00:47:55,647
Just us.

332
00:47:57,569 --> 00:47:59,480
If we ever get separated -

333
00:47:59,822 --> 00:48:01,778
we'll meet again here.

334
00:48:02,658 --> 00:48:05,445
Dead Man's Cabin. Promise?

335
00:48:06,536 --> 00:48:07,946
I promise.

336
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:13,449
I'll wait for you here even
if I get lead poisoning.

337
00:48:14,377 --> 00:48:17,084
And the Stalin's Organs roar.

338
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,556
Show me your photos.

339
00:48:35,357 --> 00:48:36,972
I won't.

340
00:48:37,775 --> 00:48:41,688
Of your family. Your life.

341
00:48:42,697 --> 00:48:45,063
I have no family of my own.

342
00:48:45,533 --> 00:48:46,522
No.

343
00:48:47,535 --> 00:48:51,608
I want to learn you. I want to -

344
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,953
Iook through your eyes
and see everything inside.

345
00:48:59,756 --> 00:49:02,338
I wonder what that would be.

346
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:04,750
Your true soul.

347
00:49:07,889 --> 00:49:10,005
And I have eyes that see.

348
00:49:11,017 --> 00:49:13,099
That's why I'm the Wildeye.

349
00:49:15,147 --> 00:49:17,559
I can see. Everything.

350
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:20,432
Your soul.

351
00:49:21,403 --> 00:49:22,768
Whatever that is.

352
00:49:25,282 --> 00:49:26,146
What now?

353
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:29,366
I'll go uphill, see if can
raise them on the radio.

354
00:49:29,786 --> 00:49:31,242
Report where we are -

355
00:49:32,205 --> 00:49:34,161
so you won't get in trouble.

356
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:36,160
I don't care.

357
00:51:06,758 --> 00:51:08,544
Forgot the camera case.

358
00:51:10,427 --> 00:51:13,385
Where did you get them?

359
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:17,969
They're my work.

360
00:51:20,312 --> 00:51:22,724
Why did you do that?

361
00:51:26,485 --> 00:51:28,396
Why did you do that?

362
00:51:35,286 --> 00:51:38,733
I don't care about them,
that's war! But tell me!

363
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:12,832
Those photos.

364
00:53:14,134 --> 00:53:17,581
They're straight from
my nightmares or -

365
00:53:18,013 --> 00:53:19,719
even worse.

366
00:53:23,518 --> 00:53:26,635
Have you done such things?

367
00:53:28,273 --> 00:53:30,389
Yes, or...

368
00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:33,270
I can't remember.

369
00:53:34,029 --> 00:53:37,396
It was long ago - in Babi Yar.

370
00:53:45,999 --> 00:53:49,116
Gödel killed a lot of people.

371
00:53:49,419 --> 00:53:51,626
Or we killed a lot of people.

372
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,041
I can't remember!

373
00:54:01,973 --> 00:54:04,055
Helena!
-Oh, hell.

374
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:05,715
Kneel there.

375
00:54:10,606 --> 00:54:12,437
Damn you, I say.

376
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,940
Right.

377
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:18,228
This one was in a barn
sheltering from the rain.

378
00:54:18,448 --> 00:54:23,272
Why did you take him with you?
-I meant to shoot him.

379
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:27,407
Then we shook hands.

380
00:54:27,915 --> 00:54:29,621
I get money for this one.

381
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:34,908
He's been hiding in
a potato cellar all week.

382
00:54:36,132 --> 00:54:38,748
We may all be charged for it.

383
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:41,091
He must be shot.

384
00:54:45,808 --> 00:54:49,175
Write papers for him for the camp.
He's a good boy.

385
00:54:50,396 --> 00:54:51,602
I can't.

386
00:54:52,648 --> 00:54:54,809
Half a dozen men
are looking for him.

387
00:54:54,984 --> 00:54:56,895
I helped him escape.

388
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,485
He's my trustee.
You won't shoot him.

389
00:55:00,656 --> 00:55:02,772
Dammit. We must kill him.

390
00:55:02,992 --> 00:55:05,278
Help me escape.

391
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:08,069
You are a good person.

392
00:55:11,417 --> 00:55:13,499
Let's go! He's dead!

393
00:55:42,114 --> 00:55:44,105
Thank you. You must go.

394
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,421
We have missed you.

395
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:05,498
You're the only nurse in the camp now.

396
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:13,387
You begin your new job in
the Cowshed tomorrow.

397
00:56:23,238 --> 00:56:25,445
My brother. We've got work for you.

398
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:27,819
Do you have any medicine?

399
00:56:29,494 --> 00:56:32,736
You should just kill yourself.

400
00:58:15,141 --> 00:58:17,553
Proper music. And theatre.

401
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,592
You miss them here.

402
00:58:19,604 --> 00:58:21,219
CiviIization.

403
00:58:27,361 --> 00:58:29,977
She drinks.
A promising beginning.

404
00:58:37,121 --> 00:58:39,407
Devil's piss. Shit.

405
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:41,910
Now, Miss.

406
00:58:42,126 --> 00:58:44,959
What happened and
where were you that week?

407
00:58:45,254 --> 00:58:46,790
It was just like -

408
00:58:47,048 --> 00:58:49,164
Jouni and Johannes said.

409
00:58:50,468 --> 00:58:52,174
We got caught in the raid.

410
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:56,133
Found a car and drove to the camp.

411
00:58:56,390 --> 00:59:00,554
Really? Did you see the fugitive?
-No.

412
00:59:11,906 --> 00:59:13,942
So hardy.

413
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:20,533
Like a... What are they...

414
00:59:24,793 --> 00:59:26,624
Dwarf birch.

415
00:59:29,757 --> 00:59:31,998
Johann is not a completely
healthy man.

416
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,751
Nothing wrong with him.

417
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,633
A broken frontal bone.
You know why?

418
00:59:41,894 --> 00:59:44,135
In the Ukraine, at Babi Yar.

419
00:59:44,355 --> 00:59:47,643
Johann and the men were having fun.

420
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:52,064
Shot young swallows at a sandpit.

421
00:59:56,034 --> 00:59:57,865
Killed thousands.

422
00:59:58,536 --> 01:00:00,367
Tens of thousands.

423
01:00:01,705 --> 01:00:03,411
I tried to stop them.

424
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:06,165
What did he do?

425
01:00:08,045 --> 01:00:11,003
Broke my skull with a Mauser.

426
01:00:13,842 --> 01:00:15,798
That's not true!

427
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:22,680
What the hell?

428
01:00:24,102 --> 01:00:27,299
That's the Commandant's chair.

429
01:00:29,066 --> 01:00:31,022
A wooden chair.

430
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,226
Get up! -Why?

431
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:36,820
Will you shoot me?

432
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:38,405
Get up.

433
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:40,399
This chair.

434
01:00:42,037 --> 01:00:43,993
Smells of shite!

435
01:00:44,832 --> 01:00:48,120
A hint of cognac.

436
01:01:00,305 --> 01:01:04,173
You are the most courageous
woman I know.

437
01:01:06,186 --> 01:01:09,724
Who may decide -

438
01:01:13,068 --> 01:01:15,855
who lives and who dies?

439
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,361
The hell I know?

440
01:01:18,616 --> 01:01:23,110
Believe me, I don't know either.
I just follow orders.

441
01:01:29,251 --> 01:01:30,866
That's all.

442
01:01:32,212 --> 01:01:35,659
You cut and collect.
Begin with that.

443
01:01:38,551 --> 01:01:40,132
Shut the door.

444
01:01:55,235 --> 01:01:57,476
Turn around!

445
01:01:57,905 --> 01:02:00,487
One by one, to the right!

446
01:02:26,975 --> 01:02:28,761
The Cowshed.

447
01:02:29,269 --> 01:02:31,806
It's no place for humans.

448
01:02:33,065 --> 01:02:36,637
Fear not. I promise to get
you out of there, Wildeye.

449
01:02:36,943 --> 01:02:39,275
Haataja had a different job.

450
01:02:40,072 --> 01:02:41,562
Believe me.

451
01:02:46,203 --> 01:02:49,161
Tell me about your mother.

452
01:02:53,251 --> 01:02:56,038
My mother Annikki and
my father Fritz Angelhurst -

453
01:02:56,254 --> 01:02:58,165
met in Petsamo.

454
01:02:59,424 --> 01:03:01,585
Mother gave travellers ant baths -

455
01:03:01,884 --> 01:03:04,842
ate raw birds and fish.

456
01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:14,845
Mother died giving birth to me.

457
01:03:19,819 --> 01:03:22,561
Father never forgave me.

458
01:03:31,539 --> 01:03:34,201
My father was killed, too.

459
01:03:36,419 --> 01:03:39,206
But he was not a good father.

460
01:03:43,926 --> 01:03:47,123
You are hot-blooded.

461
01:03:48,931 --> 01:03:50,592
Just like me!

462
01:04:15,207 --> 01:04:17,289
I can still taste you.

463
01:04:21,297 --> 01:04:24,130
Have you eaten fruit? -What?

464
01:04:24,676 --> 01:04:27,133
You smell fruitful.

465
01:05:06,758 --> 01:05:08,874
I love you.

466
01:05:24,026 --> 01:05:27,723
Greetings from the open
Foaming sea

467
01:05:28,029 --> 01:05:31,647
The shore's nowhere in sight.

468
01:05:31,992 --> 01:05:35,735
The wind blows wild
Even a sailor takes fright

469
01:05:36,037 --> 01:05:39,109
When the stormy weather blows.

470
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:43,497
I keep thinking of you out here

471
01:05:43,754 --> 01:05:47,076
Ah ah, thinking of you

472
01:05:47,383 --> 01:05:50,705
The sparkle of your eyes of blue

473
01:05:51,052 --> 01:05:54,624
And your golden curls.

474
01:05:54,973 --> 01:05:58,465
And I sing my song to you

475
01:06:52,698 --> 01:06:56,987
Can you love me despite what happened -

476
01:06:57,577 --> 01:06:59,192
if it is true?

477
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:04,068
I will. I can't do otherwise.

478
01:07:07,587 --> 01:07:09,202
We're leaving.

479
01:07:09,673 --> 01:07:11,789
You want to? -I do.

480
01:07:12,342 --> 01:07:14,708
Listen carefully, I've arranged things.

481
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:18,212
Rovaniemi for two days.

482
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:24,175
You are safe, you are a Finn.

483
01:07:24,645 --> 01:07:27,102
You just have to trust me.

484
01:07:28,399 --> 01:07:30,515
Remember the Dead Man's Cabin.

485
01:07:30,819 --> 01:07:32,935
If the war ever separates us -

486
01:07:33,154 --> 01:07:34,439
wait for me there.

487
01:07:34,614 --> 01:07:39,233
It'd be good to live there.
-I promise to come back.

488
01:08:07,813 --> 01:08:09,849
I love thee.

489
01:08:11,276 --> 01:08:13,232
Please come back.

490
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,531
They're from the camp.

491
01:09:02,868 --> 01:09:06,031
Jew, soldiers, politruks.

492
01:09:07,247 --> 01:09:10,535
Are you involved in this? -No.

493
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,042
But you are, and Johannes.

494
01:09:14,338 --> 01:09:16,545
They used to kill and bury you.

495
01:09:16,841 --> 01:09:20,709
Now they dig up and destroy
corpses to leave no evidence.

496
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:23,552
Insane business!

497
01:09:24,014 --> 01:09:27,336
It's the Devil's doing, Satan's work.

498
01:09:28,185 --> 01:09:29,800
The times are changing.

499
01:09:30,563 --> 01:09:32,895
You think it won't touch you.

500
01:09:33,482 --> 01:09:36,224
But you may come to a sad end.

501
01:09:58,007 --> 01:10:01,329
Wrong things happen
happening at the camp. -True.

502
01:10:03,428 --> 01:10:05,464
You can't accept it.

503
01:10:09,977 --> 01:10:11,092
Your job is just -

504
01:10:11,395 --> 01:10:14,011
to help those women. -How?

505
01:10:18,318 --> 01:10:21,515
Any way we can.
God gave you a gift.

506
01:10:21,696 --> 01:10:23,402
Use it!

507
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:28,982
They poison the prisoners at night.

508
01:10:30,622 --> 01:10:35,116
Gödel makes tests with the unborn babies.

509
01:10:36,253 --> 01:10:39,620
And I see how they screw the women.

510
01:10:40,757 --> 01:10:43,248
By force, without leave.

511
01:10:44,886 --> 01:10:47,958
Some prisoners are given injections.

512
01:10:48,182 --> 01:10:50,423
Straight in the back, -

513
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,216
in the hip, the buttocks.

514
01:10:54,813 --> 01:10:56,678
Sometimes I think -

515
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:59,602
someone has put in the drinks I give -

516
01:11:00,569 --> 01:11:03,857
cholera, or some other plague.

517
01:11:04,114 --> 01:11:06,901
They died so fast.

518
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:16,782
I was -

519
01:11:17,085 --> 01:11:19,076
a Child of God.

520
01:11:19,588 --> 01:11:20,873
I was -

521
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:22,870
A child of God.

522
01:11:25,385 --> 01:11:27,967
And now I am an Angel of Death.

523
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:35,263
You think you're better than we others.

524
01:11:37,522 --> 01:11:39,058
You aren't.

525
01:12:05,634 --> 01:12:08,706
Russian prisoner, number 1322.

526
01:12:10,346 --> 01:12:12,007
Malnourished, won't talk.

527
01:12:12,265 --> 01:12:15,883
Anaemia: iron deficiency.
Premature childbirth.

528
01:12:16,352 --> 01:12:19,469
Did the foetus die? -It did.

529
01:12:20,774 --> 01:12:22,014
You do talk.

530
01:12:22,901 --> 01:12:24,766
And Finnish!

531
01:12:25,904 --> 01:12:29,396
Good. What's your name?

532
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:32,530
Heta.

533
01:12:33,202 --> 01:12:36,319
Are you Finnish?

534
01:12:38,207 --> 01:12:39,743
From Kirkkoniemi?

535
01:12:42,211 --> 01:12:44,418
You're Heta! I know you!

536
01:12:44,588 --> 01:12:46,749
Jouni's been looking for you like mad.

537
01:12:48,134 --> 01:12:49,715
I'll send him a word right away.

538
01:12:50,011 --> 01:12:52,252
He'll come to get you. -Don't.

539
01:12:52,721 --> 01:12:56,168
Don't tell him I'm like this.

540
01:12:59,896 --> 01:13:02,968
I'll get you into other ward.

541
01:13:03,983 --> 01:13:07,100
So you don't have to be
here in the Cowshed.

542
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,687
But Jouni's been looking
for you like crazy.

543
01:13:38,809 --> 01:13:40,470
Stop!

544
01:13:45,441 --> 01:13:47,853
A Finnish woman is
among the prisoners.

545
01:14:00,373 --> 01:14:03,240
A Finnish woman is
also among the prisoners.

546
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:07,615
Heta Knepps.
You may not take Finns.

547
01:14:08,381 --> 01:14:10,121
We don't know where she's from.

548
01:14:10,383 --> 01:14:14,251
She speaks Finnish.
And you do tests on her.

549
01:14:14,512 --> 01:14:17,049
You can't put her in the Cowshed.

550
01:14:18,974 --> 01:14:21,636
We won't. For now.

551
01:14:21,977 --> 01:14:26,596
She can be a control case
for the rest of the scum.

552
01:14:29,276 --> 01:14:32,723
Our tests benefit
the whole of humanity.

553
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:36,355
Think about -

554
01:14:37,117 --> 01:14:39,278
what ails mankind.

555
01:14:40,954 --> 01:14:42,660
Cholera.

556
01:14:43,707 --> 01:14:45,663
Typhus, disease.

557
01:14:46,544 --> 01:14:47,784
The plague.

558
01:14:49,588 --> 01:14:52,125
We fight them here -

559
01:14:52,716 --> 01:14:55,879
with our small contribution.

560
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,682
Can I move her or not?

561
01:15:06,939 --> 01:15:08,895
One more thing.

562
01:15:09,608 --> 01:15:11,769
You lied to me.

563
01:15:13,737 --> 01:15:16,479
You never were at the other camps.

564
01:15:22,996 --> 01:15:27,194
No one lies to me without consequences.

565
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,916
Get out, please.

566
01:15:42,474 --> 01:15:44,556
You'll be transferred tomorrow.

567
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,839
I'll send a word to Jouni.
He'll come to fetch us.

568
01:15:48,271 --> 01:15:49,807
Sleep now.

569
01:15:50,148 --> 01:15:51,684
And stay alive.

570
01:16:12,795 --> 01:16:14,376
Open the door!

571
01:16:15,257 --> 01:16:17,669
Get in! Faster, you swine!

572
01:16:17,675 --> 01:16:20,291
Get in! Shut the door!

573
01:16:21,596 --> 01:16:23,336
Get in! Faster!

574
01:16:26,101 --> 01:16:27,557
Shut the door!

575
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:34,977
Today, our delegation in Moscow -

576
01:16:35,235 --> 01:16:39,399
signed an agreement on the armistice -

577
01:16:39,656 --> 01:16:43,729
with the Soviet Union
and the United Kingdom.

578
01:16:45,953 --> 01:16:49,650
A serious matter is that we must disarm -

579
01:16:49,999 --> 01:16:55,414
the German troops in our country
and hand them over to the Allies.

580
01:16:55,713 --> 01:16:59,661
Despite this, we must quickly -

581
01:16:59,967 --> 01:17:03,789
demobilise our forces.

582
01:17:06,015 --> 01:17:09,337
The terms of the armistice
contain 23 separate points.

583
01:17:09,686 --> 01:17:12,177
Did you hear? Peace.

584
01:17:12,355 --> 01:17:15,188
To be correctly understood...

585
01:17:17,569 --> 01:17:21,016
Put the Russians in the prison barracks.

586
01:17:21,238 --> 01:17:23,900
The women from
the Cowshed into the yard -

587
01:17:24,075 --> 01:17:28,023
and the Finns in rows in the middle.

588
01:17:29,121 --> 01:17:32,818
All documents in the hospital
must be burned.

589
01:17:33,459 --> 01:17:36,075
Get the Finns to help you!

590
01:17:37,129 --> 01:17:38,994
Move it!

591
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,215
Goddamn it!

592
01:17:43,469 --> 01:17:45,551
This is bad.

593
01:17:45,888 --> 01:17:49,380
The Germans won 't bloody
leave without a fight.

594
01:17:57,108 --> 01:17:58,848
Get in there.

595
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:01,852
Jouni will come for you,
meanwhile stay out of sight.

596
01:18:02,113 --> 01:18:04,946
They'll find me here.
-They won't.

597
01:18:07,493 --> 01:18:10,860
That's for the d rugs and
injections given to the prisoners.

598
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:14,402
The Germans fear
they'll catch the plague.

599
01:18:51,578 --> 01:18:53,114
Lights out!

600
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:19,777
You know where the documents are.

601
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,911
The tests. Destroy everything.

602
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:24,409
Give me the key to the safe.

603
01:20:25,338 --> 01:20:26,874
I don't have it.

604
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:30,711
Give me the key.

605
01:20:40,228 --> 01:20:41,718
Locked.

606
01:20:50,571 --> 01:20:55,816
Take the safe outside
and blow it open.

607
01:21:01,249 --> 01:21:03,615
You stupid woman.

608
01:21:11,259 --> 01:21:14,251
I won't do Satan's work
for you anymore.

609
01:21:18,808 --> 01:21:21,595
I won't do Satan's work
for you any more.

610
01:21:24,355 --> 01:21:27,392
Fetch explosives and blow up...
-I understand.

611
01:21:27,692 --> 01:21:29,273
I won't do it.

612
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:32,943
Do your death work yourself!

613
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:35,280
I won't do Satan's work
for you any more!

614
01:21:35,533 --> 01:21:38,445
Do your death work yourself!
I won't be part of this war any more.

615
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:40,492
I won't be part of it!

616
01:21:40,746 --> 01:21:43,078
You hear? I won't be part of it.

617
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:45,657
Kill them yourself!
I won't do it any more!

618
01:21:45,835 --> 01:21:48,076
Do your death work yourself!

619
01:21:49,297 --> 01:21:52,494
I won't be part of this war.

620
01:24:14,524 --> 01:24:16,765
By height order.

621
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:20,439
All prisoners in rows by height order.

622
01:24:48,808 --> 01:24:50,423
We will leave tomorrow.

623
01:24:50,935 --> 01:24:53,142
I'll come for you in the morning.

624
01:25:02,614 --> 01:25:05,151
You're under arrest!
For court-martial!

625
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:29,171
This woman is guilty
of aiding a prisoner.

626
01:25:31,643 --> 01:25:33,429
We made a head count.

627
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:38,389
The Finnish woman you helped
escaped last night.

628
01:25:42,195 --> 01:25:44,436
I know nothing of it.

629
01:25:47,951 --> 01:25:50,112
I must punish you.

630
01:27:53,367 --> 01:27:56,234
I could kill you.
But I don't want to.

631
01:27:56,495 --> 01:27:58,611
Johannes will avenge me!

632
01:27:59,498 --> 01:28:01,238
Johannes -

633
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:03,991
is either a prisoner or dead.

634
01:28:04,294 --> 01:28:09,459
The Russians are less than
10 km away, advancing fast.

635
01:28:12,344 --> 01:28:14,426
I am sorry.

636
01:29:39,431 --> 01:29:41,092
Are you all right?

637
01:29:42,559 --> 01:29:44,424
Your back looks bad.

638
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:51,023
We must flee. Give me my glasses.

639
01:29:51,234 --> 01:29:56,058
We don't have much time.
Or they will kill me -

640
01:29:56,239 --> 01:29:59,811
and burn you in the storeroom.
Wait here, take out the gun.

641
01:29:59,992 --> 01:30:02,529
We are escaping now.

642
01:30:22,181 --> 01:30:24,297
Help me escape.

643
01:30:29,522 --> 01:30:31,888
I'm not afraid of guns any more.

644
01:30:34,736 --> 01:30:35,851
Three years -

645
01:30:36,153 --> 01:30:37,563
in this hole.

646
01:30:42,869 --> 01:30:44,609
I will help you.

647
01:30:55,548 --> 01:30:57,504
He's alive.

648
01:30:58,259 --> 01:31:00,625
Kill him! Kill!

649
01:31:11,188 --> 01:31:13,429
I'm not a butcher.

650
01:31:13,816 --> 01:31:15,477
Let's go!

651
01:32:30,934 --> 01:32:33,266
Get into a shelter.

652
01:32:33,729 --> 01:32:35,515
I'll find us some food.

653
01:33:03,091 --> 01:33:05,833
The hell you're doing here?

654
01:33:08,514 --> 01:33:10,721
Things turned hot in Finland -

655
01:33:10,974 --> 01:33:14,011
trying to find Heta
in the camp and the ports.

656
01:33:16,146 --> 01:33:19,263
Russkies came with such force -

657
01:33:19,525 --> 01:33:22,722
they almost got the Fritzes crying.

658
01:33:26,114 --> 01:33:29,777
Didn't give me the good eye, either.

659
01:33:34,456 --> 01:33:36,321
Is it you, Jouni?

660
01:33:50,806 --> 01:33:52,262
Heta?

661
01:33:52,933 --> 01:33:54,798
Yes.

662
01:33:57,854 --> 01:34:00,766
I've been looking for you.

663
01:34:03,193 --> 01:34:06,765
Come closer if you promise
not to look at me.

664
01:34:17,373 --> 01:34:20,695
Hair's gone.
-Don't ask.

665
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:27,247
I won't if you don't want me to.

666
01:34:38,394 --> 01:34:41,966
I've been running everywhere -

667
01:34:42,148 --> 01:34:45,390
and you are here.

668
01:34:49,865 --> 01:34:53,232
Sometimes things turn out well.

669
01:34:59,790 --> 01:35:01,826
This German boat goes to Narvik.

670
01:35:02,043 --> 01:35:05,581
I paid them to take you to the cabin.
But be careful.

671
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:09,793
Life is cheap now,
don't trust anyone.

672
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:13,418
I'll take Heta to safety,
and come for you.

673
01:37:22,057 --> 01:37:24,093
Who is it?

674
01:37:29,606 --> 01:37:31,437
Who is it?

675
01:37:34,528 --> 01:37:38,396
What are you afraid of?
You're fine.

676
01:37:40,075 --> 01:37:42,316
Love sure tastes sweet but -

677
01:37:42,619 --> 01:37:45,452
it hurts my soul to leave you, Wildeye.

678
01:37:45,956 --> 01:37:48,117
Carve a pair of skis for me.

679
01:37:48,417 --> 01:37:49,998
For the winter.

680
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:53,661
I won't! You'll die anyway.

681
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:56,876
If I die, I die.

682
01:37:57,551 --> 01:37:59,917
But now you'll take me
to Björne's store.

683
01:38:03,223 --> 01:38:05,760
He must have a third eye
for the bad times.

684
01:38:05,975 --> 01:38:08,591
How would he guess
we'd be coming today?

685
01:38:08,895 --> 01:38:10,055
I told him.

686
01:38:10,314 --> 01:38:12,851
Take it easy inside,
don't ask questions.

687
01:38:13,066 --> 01:38:15,057
Tell you later.

688
01:38:15,402 --> 01:38:18,189
When Lispetti gave birth to the negro -

689
01:38:18,363 --> 01:38:22,060
I said now I've seen it all.

690
01:38:50,645 --> 01:38:52,385
These will get you to Sweden -

691
01:38:52,397 --> 01:38:54,058
and over the sea
to Southern Finland.

692
01:38:54,315 --> 01:38:56,306
We'll leave Johannes'
passport at the cabin.

693
01:38:56,526 --> 01:38:58,983
He'll find it there if he's still alive.

694
01:39:00,363 --> 01:39:02,649
He has a Finnish passport? -Yes.

695
01:39:02,991 --> 01:39:05,983
Got him a Finnish birth certificate.

696
01:39:48,327 --> 01:39:50,363
Damn you, Wildeye.

697
01:39:51,664 --> 01:39:53,780
Along the swamp to the sea.

698
01:39:57,754 --> 01:39:59,039
You know why -

699
01:39:59,297 --> 01:40:02,369
I never had to go to the war?

700
01:40:04,427 --> 01:40:08,170
Shot a bullet in my leg
through a block of wood.

701
01:40:13,477 --> 01:40:14,808
I'm a coward.

702
01:40:18,024 --> 01:40:19,980
I knew about it.

703
01:40:30,119 --> 01:40:33,031
You're not a coward, brother.

704
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:38,081
Just plain crazy.

705
01:40:54,143 --> 01:40:56,304
We'll see again soon!

706
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:19,081
It's cold.

707
01:41:19,585 --> 01:41:21,826
I'll make a fire for Johannes.

708
01:41:34,683 --> 01:41:37,265
So you stayed here to die.

709
01:41:44,109 --> 01:41:47,146
Take it easy. Sit.

710
01:41:51,825 --> 01:41:54,066
I'm not afraid of dying.

711
01:41:54,453 --> 01:41:57,695
I wouldn't move around much, though.

712
01:41:58,499 --> 01:42:01,571
Gorges full of SS bomb units.

713
01:42:01,794 --> 01:42:05,742
Russians at the Teno already,
German patrols all the way from Alta.

714
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,713
Fritzes burn up Lapland
as they retreat.

715
01:42:12,805 --> 01:42:17,424
Told me to slaughter everyone
I find in these fjords.

716
01:42:17,893 --> 01:42:20,384
And they pay well.

717
01:42:21,563 --> 01:42:25,636
They will burn this cabin, too.
And you, when they find you.

718
01:42:27,069 --> 01:42:31,187
The axe is outside.
And you have no gun.

719
01:42:31,448 --> 01:42:34,190
No guns, no.

720
01:42:36,787 --> 01:42:38,652
Don't kill me.

721
01:42:53,511 --> 01:42:55,627
Now you have one.

722
01:43:04,522 --> 01:43:08,344
Left the bullets on a rock outside.

723
01:43:10,778 --> 01:43:14,145
You might just be crazy enough
to shoot me.

724
01:43:15,908 --> 01:43:20,857
Dried meat, tinned British beef,
a keg of rum.

725
01:43:27,545 --> 01:43:29,627
Your father told me to give this to you.

726
01:43:29,839 --> 01:43:33,252
Killed him a year ago, I had to.

727
01:43:34,136 --> 01:43:36,252
A good man, though.

728
01:43:37,597 --> 01:43:42,091
Watched over you, regretted everything.

729
01:43:43,311 --> 01:43:45,097
Forgive me.

730
01:47:09,975 --> 01:47:13,217
Hey! Where're you going?

731
01:47:13,812 --> 01:47:15,723
Stop! Do you hear?

732
01:47:16,523 --> 01:47:18,434
Volodka, who is he?

733
01:47:20,652 --> 01:47:22,392
Show me your papers.

734
01:47:22,863 --> 01:47:25,821
Did you lose your keys?

735
01:47:26,783 --> 01:47:28,148
Stand back.

736
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,741
I'll open the door.

737
01:47:31,204 --> 01:47:32,740
Right. Come here.

738
01:47:34,249 --> 01:47:35,238
Alarm!

739
01:47:36,167 --> 01:47:39,614
A prisoner escapes!

740
01:49:19,312 --> 01:49:22,725
Men! Our orders are
to burn the house.

741
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:24,350
I say -

742
01:49:24,859 --> 01:49:26,724
we lock it up first, and call Ifjord.

743
01:49:26,986 --> 01:49:28,726
All right?

744
01:50:11,614 --> 01:50:14,276
I will write a few more lines.

745
01:50:15,075 --> 01:50:17,066
There is no more food.

746
01:50:17,537 --> 01:50:19,778
I even ate the candle.

747
01:50:20,205 --> 01:50:22,491
Darling, it was not tasty.

748
01:50:24,001 --> 01:50:28,119
I will die now, knowing that
you are on your way here.

749
01:50:29,548 --> 01:50:31,504
If you were here -

750
01:50:31,926 --> 01:50:35,123
we would talk at the same time -

751
01:50:36,013 --> 01:50:39,676
as lovers do when they meet again.

752
01:50:40,935 --> 01:50:44,223
I will smile, happy, and...

753
01:51:42,121 --> 01:51:43,577
I a m h e re.

754
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:47,746
Good that you are here.

755
01:51:51,630 --> 01:51:54,997
You took your bloody time.

756
01:52:19,491 --> 01:52:20,856
I carry...

757
01:52:22,243 --> 01:52:25,531
I carry our child inside me.

758
01:52:27,248 --> 01:52:29,705
It is a quiet one.

759
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:33,418
I can't feel its heartbeat anymore.

760
01:52:36,425 --> 01:52:39,007
I was so afraid -

761
01:52:40,261 --> 01:52:43,094
and now you saved us.

762
01:53:21,427 --> 01:53:23,338
I cooked for you.

763
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,431
Bloody hell.

764
01:53:34,858 --> 01:53:36,849
I put the candle in it.

765
01:53:42,448 --> 01:53:45,940
Do you want to love a man like me?

766
01:53:47,036 --> 01:53:49,778
I'm sure I don't.

767
01:53:49,998 --> 01:53:52,785
But I do love you so.

768
01:54:24,782 --> 01:54:27,023
I feel like I am resurrected.

769
01:54:27,701 --> 01:54:30,534
Now to Sweden and then
to safety in Finland.

770
01:54:31,539 --> 01:54:35,236
We 'll be always together. Always.

771
01:54:38,629 --> 01:54:41,416
Now I have nothing more to tell.
