00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:35,759
Lord Porchester?

1
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:36,919
This way, madam.

2
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:47,132
At the end of the bar.

3
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:53,292
- Hello.
- Hello, Porchey!

4
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:59,052
- You found the place all right?
- The taxi driver did, yes.

5
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:01,972
Of course. Wonderful.

6
00:01:06,492 --> 00:01:07,852
Lord Porchester.

7
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:16,172
Ladies.

8
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:18,492
Is it just me,
or is this place faintly ridiculous?

9
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:24,252
Two of my great hates in life,
fine dining and central London.

10
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:28,852
I just thought it's the kind
of special occasion place one came

11
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:32,692
if one had a special question to ask.

12
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:45,372
At this moment I wish I were a poet,
not a horse-breeder.

13
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:55,292
Will you marry me?

14
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:01,452
Oh, Porchey.

15
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:06,052
- That sounds like a "no."
- No, it's not a "no".

16
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:09,092
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

17
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:13,972
- That's... 12 no's.
- I would love to.

18
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,892
On one condition.

19
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:20,252
That you don't still
hold a torch for her.

20
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:21,612
Who?

21
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:26,212
Oh. Her.

22
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:37,812
I know how close you were,
and how close your families still are.

23
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:40,612
It's true. She and I, we are close.

24
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:43,132
I was close to her father.
I am close to her sister.

25
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:44,932
Our families are close.

26
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:48,532
In many ways, and I speak as a breeder
myself, it would have been a good match.

27
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:50,652
- Perfect match.
- I won't deny it.

28
00:02:52,412 --> 00:02:54,972
<i>Except for the fact
it was never on the cards.</i>

29
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:02,212
For her, there was only ever Philip.

30
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,412
And for you?

31
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:29,292
There's only you.

32
00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:04,212
Lilibet?

33
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,892
Right you are, Jock.
Yes, I'll let him know. Thank you.

34
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:58,372
I'm sure he'll be delighted. Bye.

35
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,772
Are you winning?

36
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:14,932
No. There was one, brief,
tantalizing moment

37
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:20,292
when I thought I had it.
I moved in for the kill.

38
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:25,452
But then one wrong brushstroke
and it got away once again.

39
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:29,372
I've just been talking to Jock
about your 80th birthday.

40
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:31,092
No, don't mention it.

41
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:34,372
Because it happens on the same day
as the opening of Parliament,

42
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:36,892
they've decided to combine events

43
00:06:36,972 --> 00:06:40,172
and hold a reception in your honor
at the Great Hall.

44
00:06:40,252 --> 00:06:41,812
Oh, that's very nice.

45
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:44,612
Oh, and it's going to be
Graham Sutherland.

46
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:46,732
- Who?
- The painter.

47
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:48,972
- To paint your portrait.
- What portrait?

48
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:54,292
It's the official portrait commissioned
by both Houses. It's your present.

49
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:58,052
Sutherland? Never heard of him.

50
00:06:58,132 --> 00:07:00,932
He's got quite the reputation.
He's a modernist.

51
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:05,572
Oh. Not sure I can trust a modernist
with an English name.

52
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:09,932
Give me a German modernist.
Or an Italian.

53
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,212
They're the ones
who have to start all over again.

54
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:15,612
Whatever would an Englishman
want to change?

55
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:39,292
<i>It's grand to be home again</i>
<i>after so long an absence.</i>

56
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:44,732
The surgeon who operated on me
told me yesterday that all was well.

57
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:50,452
I'll need to have a further period
of convalescence, put on some weight,

58
00:07:50,532 --> 00:07:52,332
but there is nothing else to worry about.

59
00:07:52,412 --> 00:07:56,412
As I said, it's grand to be home again.

60
00:07:56,492 --> 00:08:00,332
I look forward to being back at work
just as soon as possible.

61
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:05,012
Thank you!

62
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:08,012
Thank you!

63
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:24,172
- Hello?
- Porchey? I hope I'm not disturbing.

64
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:26,652
- Goodness.
- Am I disturbing?

65
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:31,332
- No.
- Good.

66
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:34,252
It's Aureole.
I think we're making a mistake.

67
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:38,652
<i>- I think we should lead from the start.</i>
- And I think you're wrong.

68
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:41,132
But we both know
he doesn't hold up naturally.

69
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:44,612
We tried holding him up
against Darius before. And Darius won.

70
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,732
That was the Guineas, which is a mile.

71
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:50,692
This is the King George.
A mile and a half.

72
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:54,732
What will we do
if he plays up before the race?

73
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:57,812
He always plays up. That's who he is.

74
00:08:57,892 --> 00:09:00,572
You don't seem the slightest bit worried.

75
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:02,852
<i>Anything else?</i>

76
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:07,572
Well, can I just say one more time,
for the record...

77
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:11,772
I think we should start fast,
and run at a good clip.

78
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:16,372
- Noted.
- I am right sometimes, you know.

79
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:19,372
Even you said yourself
that I have good instincts.

80
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:23,092
You do.
And I might well live to regret it.

81
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:28,892
- That, and a good many other things.
- Oh, dear. Such as?

82
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:30,452
Good night.

83
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:08,692
<i>Mr. Sutherland, Prime Minister.</i>

84
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:10,572
- Good morning.
- How do you do?

85
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,732
- Good morning, hello. How do you do?
- Good morning.

86
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,452
- How do you do, sir? It's an honor.
- No, no. The honor is mine.

87
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:24,452
So, where do you want me?

88
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:33,932
So, will we be engaged
in flattery or reality?

89
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:37,252
Are you going to paint me
as a cherub or a bulldog?

90
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:39,972
I imagine there are a great number
of Mr. Churchills.

91
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:42,772
Yes, indeed there are.

92
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:45,812
Well, as you search for him,

93
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:49,492
perhaps I can implore you
not to feel the need to be too accurate.

94
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:54,692
- Why? Accuracy is truth.
- No. For accuracy, we have the camera.

95
00:10:55,532 --> 00:11:01,412
Painting is the higher art.
I paint a bit myself, you know.

96
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:05,172
Yes, sir, I know.

97
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:09,532
And I never let accuracy get in the way
of truth if I don't want it to.

98
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:12,932
If I see some landscape I like,

99
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:15,396
and I wish there wasn't a factory
in the background,

100
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:17,092
I leave the factory out.

101
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:25,572
So, Mr. Sutherland, tell me,
I'm fascinated. What is your process?

102
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:31,212
First, I shall take some photographs,

103
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,772
they'll be useful as reference
when I get back to the studio.

104
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:37,332
Then I shall do some charcoal sketches,
studies of the head, the hands

105
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:39,572
and then I'll work those sketches up.

106
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:48,852
The actual painting up
will be done in my studio at home.

107
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,972
- Is this... Do you mind?
- Perfectly all right. Carry on.

108
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:58,812
Well, what pose are you thinking of?

109
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:01,852
Seated.

110
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:10,052
I could try standing?
It might be more commanding. Dynamic.

111
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:12,852
It might make me look younger.

112
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:18,372
I thought the painting was supposed
to celebrate reaching a certain age?

113
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:20,052
Four score years, Winston.

114
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:26,652
- I think seated is more senatorial.
- Oh, senatorial.

115
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:29,252
What nonsense.

116
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:33,252
Yes, I agree.

117
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,732
Cigar or no cigar?

118
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:45,732
No cigar.

119
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:50,212
- Garter robes or no garter robes?
- No finery.

120
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:52,612
No grandiosity.

121
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:56,332
Dressed merely as a parliamentarian.

122
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:58,252
How prosaic.

123
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:05,692
- I liked him.
- Yes, I could tell.

124
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:08,812
You were smitten,
blushing like a little girl.

125
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:13,372
- Well, he is rather a wow.
- A "wow"?

126
00:13:13,452 --> 00:13:17,812
Tall and handsome, saturnine.
A bit of a Heathcliff.

127
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:19,972
He wants total control.

128
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:23,332
Well, any artist worth anything
would insist on that.

129
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:25,692
- You don't really want a flatterer.
- Yes, I do.

130
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:26,905
No, you don't.

131
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,516
Besides, it's manifestly
clear he's a fan.

132
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:33,252
Oh, no, don't be silly.
You can smell the socialism on him.

133
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:35,652
Even the socialists
acknowledge you saved the country.

134
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:38,452
Through gritted teeth.

135
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:41,452
I have the protective instincts
of a loving wife

136
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:44,212
and I can tell you
this one is not an assassin.

137
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:47,292
Oh, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Look. Look at this.

138
00:13:58,412 --> 00:14:03,092
<i>It's Aureole, the Queen's Aureole,
the Queen's horse, followed by...</i>

139
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:06,172
Isn't he marvelous?

140
00:14:06,252 --> 00:14:07,732
Isn't he clever?

141
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:11,332
You were absolutely... No.

142
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:20,572
No, he won.

143
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,972
You were absolutely right.

144
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:23,892
- He's so clever!
- I know. I know.

145
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:38,692
- What a champion.
- What a champion.

146
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:41,132
- Good boy.
- Hello.

147
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:54,812
I remember getting the phone call
from your father.

148
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:59,012
When he was born.
By Hyperion and out of Angelola.

149
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:01,692
Yes, we gave him his first milk.
Do you remember?

150
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:06,212
Watching him grow up, everyone thought
his elder brother would be the star.

151
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:08,852
Your clever Papa
always had an instinct for this one.

152
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:12,652
- He's the underdog.
- And he backed him.

153
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:16,652
- And an underdog became a star.
- Yes, and his favorite horse.

154
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:21,452
So, what's next for our champion?

155
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:26,772
Well, we have received an invitation
to the Laurel International.

156
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:29,212
- America?
- Yes, next month.

157
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:34,972
He's what, four?
Already at the older end of the spectrum.

158
00:15:35,052 --> 00:15:39,612
- If you were asking my opinion...
- That is why I asked you here today.

159
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:44,332
My honest advice,
I'd consider retiring him now.

160
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:46,092
At the top of his game.

161
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:50,212
The best middle distance horse in Europe,
with a sky-high market value.

162
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,692
Let him earn you
some proper money as a stud.

163
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:59,492
I'm surprised to hear you turning down
the opportunity of going to America.

164
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:01,012
Why?

165
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:02,612
Well, that's where
your girlfriend's from,

166
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:04,276
isn't it?

167
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:09,212
- Fiancé.
- Fiancé? Goodness.

168
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:15,412
Who is she? Money, I hope.
So you can keep up the stables.

169
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:18,292
- Actually, she's a Portsmouth.
- Oh, dear. So no money.

170
00:16:18,372 --> 00:16:23,292
Some money. But horse mad.
Well, she'd have to be.

171
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,852
You'd approve, I think.

172
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:30,932
- Well, can I meet her?
- If you promise you won't scare her.

173
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:33,132
- Why would I scare her?
- You're the Queen!

174
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:35,652
- Only some of the time.
- All the time.

175
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:39,132
And that makes you terrifying.
And she's heard a lot about you.

176
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:45,292
- From whom?
- From me. Some of it nice, too.

177
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:24,132
Oh, the one you let get away.

178
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:28,052
- What?
- He's always carried a torch for you.

179
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:31,572
Porchey? Utter nonsense.

180
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:35,452
He told me himself.
One night while in his cups.

181
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:38,452
That doesn't count.

182
00:17:40,252 --> 00:17:42,692
When a man's had a drink,
that's when the truth comes out.

183
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:47,772
No. That's when the nonsense comes out.
Besides, we have interests in common.

184
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:50,532
Horses aren't an interest to you.
They're a passion.

185
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:54,852
- A passion your husband doesn't share.
- He has other passions.

186
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:56,772
So I hear.

187
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:25,012
- Sir.
- Good morning.

188
00:18:29,012 --> 00:18:31,892
The Foreign Secretary is here, sir.
Shall I show him in?

189
00:18:31,972 --> 00:18:33,332
No.

190
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:36,212
Not here.

191
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:50,212
Sorry to keep you waiting.

192
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:53,212
As apposite as ever.

193
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:56,332
I didn't mean it like that.

194
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:05,132
- There's ugliness in the air, Anthony.
- I have nothing of beauty to say.

195
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:10,012
Then say what you must,
deposit your ugliness and go.

196
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:12,732
I have more important things to do.

197
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:17,092
Very well.

198
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:23,892
At some point,

199
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:28,972
every leader must ask himself
whether by staying in office,

200
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:31,252
he is giving to the country,

201
00:19:31,332 --> 00:19:35,492
or taking from it. Helping or harming.

202
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:40,652
And I would suggest
that for some time now,

203
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:44,572
you have been taking and harming.

204
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:49,892
And therefore I come to you, in the name
of the party and of the country,

205
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:52,012
for the very last time, Winston,

206
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:58,692
- to bid you to stand down.
- I will in good time. The right time.

207
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:01,452
The right time was nine years ago
when you lost us the election.

208
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:05,812
And I have since avenged that defeat
by winning us the last election.

209
00:20:05,892 --> 00:20:08,492
I won us that, Winston! I won that!

210
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:17,252
People voted Conservative
in the clear expectation

211
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:20,332
- that you would give way to me.
- That is such rubbish!

212
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:24,332
They voted Conservative
because they couldn't stomach socialism!

213
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:27,212
Inflation is out of control.

214
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:32,072
And with every misjudgment,
with every miscalculation,

215
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:34,145
with every utterance you make,

216
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,836
that appetite to return to the left is
growing!

217
00:20:36,892 --> 00:20:38,372
Be careful, Anthony,

218
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:41,932
too much excitement is not good
for one so soon after an operation.

219
00:20:42,012 --> 00:20:45,732
Spoken by a man who
only two months ago was effectively dead.

220
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:49,532
- Which makes two of us.
- I have recovered.

221
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:54,452
That's not what I hear. I hear
you are a shadow of your former self.

222
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:57,692
That when you walk,
the pills rattle around inside of you!

223
00:20:57,772 --> 00:21:01,412
I have something
that you will never see again.

224
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:06,772
- A clean bill of health.
- Stalin said the same.

225
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:10,172
He died groveling on the floor!

226
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:13,652
Mr. Sutherland is here.

227
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:16,252
- Hello, Anthony.
- Anthony was just leaving.

228
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:19,012
Hello, Clemmie.

229
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:24,572
Yes, I was... just leaving.

230
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:28,012
Here we are.

231
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:28,972
Morning.

232
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:32,452
- Morning.
- Sir, this is my wife, Kathleen.

233
00:21:32,532 --> 00:21:35,812
She assists me sometimes.
I hope you don't mind.

234
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:07,612
Over here.

235
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:17,172
- What's that you're using?
- Pencil.

236
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,612
Yeah. But which kind?

237
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:23,492
4B or 6B, not sure.

238
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:27,252
It's a 6B.

239
00:22:27,332 --> 00:22:30,212
- And on what paper?
- Drawing paper.

240
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:33,612
I favor heavy-weight cotton,
cold pressed, deckle edged.

241
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:36,412
Sized with gelatin.

242
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:47,132
How many paintings does your husband
complete in a year, Mrs. Sutherland?

243
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:48,332
Three or four.

244
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:52,332
Would you care to guess
how many I average?

245
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:56,852
- Ten? 15?
- 60!

246
00:22:58,732 --> 00:23:02,652
Of course, I'm just a hobbyist,
an enthusiast.

247
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:05,252
Not a major artist like your husband.

248
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,772
Taking his time.

249
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:12,772
Over here.

250
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:46,492
I did a little reading about you,
Mr. Sutherland, after our last session.

251
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:49,332
- Did you?
- Yeah. Quite interesting.

252
00:23:49,412 --> 00:23:53,452
From what I read, this is all
very new to you, this portraiture.

253
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,692
I don't think anyone starts out
wanting to be a portraitist.

254
00:23:56,772 --> 00:24:01,212
Yeah. But in your search for your métier,
you've tried a bit of everything.

255
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:05,972
That's true.
I came to painting quite late.

256
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:09,092
And now that you've found it,
you'll never leave it, yes?

257
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:11,292
Yeah. I quite understand.

258
00:24:28,892 --> 00:24:31,012
How is it, Mrs. Sutherland?

259
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,572
It has truth.

260
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:38,172
- Am I to be allowed a peek?
- No.

261
00:24:39,492 --> 00:24:42,412
Well, why not? I could give you advice.

262
00:24:42,492 --> 00:24:46,332
After all,
I know this face better than you do.

263
00:24:46,412 --> 00:24:50,012
If you've made the neck too thick
or the arms too long, I can tell you.

264
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:51,419
I find in general people

265
00:24:51,444 --> 00:24:53,764
have very little understanding
of who they are.

266
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:57,932
One has to turn a blind eye to so much
of oneself in order to get through life.

267
00:24:58,012 --> 00:25:01,292
And you see it as your responsibility
to bring all that out into the open?

268
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:02,892
Certainly. The good as well as the bad.

269
00:25:02,972 --> 00:25:06,452
Just concentrate on the good,
and all will be well.

270
00:25:06,532 --> 00:25:09,372
You're not just painting me, you know.

271
00:25:09,452 --> 00:25:12,972
You're painting the Prime Minister
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain

272
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:16,092
and Northern Ireland, and everything
that great office represents.

273
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:17,772
Democracy. Freedom.

274
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:23,732
The highest ideals of government
and leadership. Just remember that.

275
00:25:33,612 --> 00:25:37,612
- Yes?
<i>- Lord Porchester, Your Majesty.</i>

276
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:40,012
- Thank you.
<i>- Plug in.</i>

277
00:25:40,092 --> 00:25:42,332
- Porchey?
- What a palaver.

278
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:44,812
<i>- What is?</i>
- Getting through to you.

279
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:49,012
<i>I picked up the phone to you just after
nine this morning. It's now gone midday.</i>

280
00:25:49,092 --> 00:25:52,692
Oh, don't exaggerate.
But, yes, I know, it is infuriating.

281
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:53,812
Fire away.

282
00:25:53,892 --> 00:25:56,692
You asked me to come up with some figures
for you with regard to Aureole.

283
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:59,932
Although I'm numerically dyslexic,
runs in the family I'm afraid,

284
00:26:00,012 --> 00:26:01,012
like the high forehead.

285
00:26:01,932 --> 00:26:04,452
<i>I have done the sums,
see if this helps you with your decision.</i>

286
00:26:04,532 --> 00:26:06,732
In the course of his lifetime
as a racehorse,

287
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:09,772
Aureole has made you
just over 40,000 pounds.

288
00:26:09,852 --> 00:26:11,532
Goodness.

289
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:15,012
<i>But if you were to put him out to stud,
he could make you far more.</i>

290
00:26:15,092 --> 00:26:17,732
<i>He's a recognized champion,
with a top-notch pedigree.</i>

291
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:20,692
<i>You could stand him at Wolferton Stud
for top dollar.</i>

292
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:25,532
Well, that's a decision then.

293
00:26:26,692 --> 00:26:27,532
Good.

294
00:26:27,612 --> 00:26:31,612
And in the meantime,
I'll ask if I can get you a direct line.

295
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:34,812
- To you?
- Yes, to me. Why?

296
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:36,972
Was there anyone else
you wanted to speak to here?

297
00:26:37,852 --> 00:26:40,012
- No.
<i>- Good.</i>

298
00:26:42,772 --> 00:26:46,372
What is it, "top dollar?" I need numbers.

299
00:26:47,252 --> 00:26:50,972
- 400.
- A pop? A shot?

300
00:26:51,052 --> 00:26:53,612
Sorry, I'm trying to find a less
onomatopoeic expression for...

301
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:55,332
- I know what it is.
- A shag.

302
00:26:56,572 --> 00:26:57,692
A cover.

303
00:26:57,772 --> 00:27:01,932
- A cover?
- Yes, that's the correct term for...

304
00:27:02,012 --> 00:27:04,612
- A horse hump?
- Yes.

305
00:27:06,412 --> 00:27:08,932
So, what might you earn then
over the course of the year?

306
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:14,052
Well, in one year alone,
Aureole might cover 40 mares.

307
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:18,172
- Making about 16,000 pounds.
- Good for him.

308
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:20,379
In the course of his lifetime
at the stud, he might sire

309
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:22,956
500, 600 foals,

310
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:25,452
making me over 200,000 pounds.

311
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:28,132
Creating an entire generation
of offspring.

312
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:31,212
- Yes.
- Father to all the foals in our stables.

313
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:33,012
And any other stable
that could afford him.

314
00:27:33,092 --> 00:27:35,292
Yes.

315
00:27:35,372 --> 00:27:38,772
Oh, I see,
so in time, every horse out there

316
00:27:38,852 --> 00:27:43,132
could somehow be related to Aureole.

317
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:47,612
- Yes, I suppose so.
- Like old man Carnarvon.

318
00:27:49,132 --> 00:27:50,092
Who?

319
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:52,732
Your friend Porchey's father.

320
00:27:53,492 --> 00:27:56,852
- Porchey?
- No, like I said, his father.

321
00:27:56,932 --> 00:28:00,652
- Yes, they're both called Porchey.
- Wasn't that the rumor?

322
00:28:00,732 --> 00:28:04,732
- What rumor?
- Well, that he'd had so many affairs,

323
00:28:04,812 --> 00:28:08,492
an entire generation of
British aristocrats was related to him.

324
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:13,652
An illegitimate "Porchey"
in every great house in the land.

325
00:28:15,212 --> 00:28:16,892
High foreheads everywhere.

326
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:20,972
- And numerical dyslexia.
- What?

327
00:28:21,812 --> 00:28:23,932
- Nothing.
- What?

328
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:25,012
Nothing!

329
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,452
Michael!

330
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:31,692
Dear boy!

331
00:28:36,412 --> 00:28:38,612
- Good night.
- Good night.

332
00:28:40,172 --> 00:28:42,732
Let me have a look at you.

333
00:28:42,812 --> 00:28:44,132
- Marvelous.
- Shall we?

334
00:28:44,212 --> 00:28:46,292
Come on. You look beautiful.

335
00:30:16,972 --> 00:30:19,452
- How is he?
- Not too bad, sir. This way.

336
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:33,412
- Morning.
- Morning.

337
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:48,972
- No wife this time?
- No.

338
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:52,892
I asked her not to come.

339
00:30:56,212 --> 00:31:01,292
Since this is to be our final session,
I wanted us to be all alone.

340
00:31:05,652 --> 00:31:10,932
- In silence preferably.
- Yes. Yes. I'll be a good boy.

341
00:31:18,172 --> 00:31:21,012
I quite understand
the need for concentration.

342
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:26,332
Painting a picture is like
fighting a battle. A bloody battle.

343
00:31:26,412 --> 00:31:32,052
In the gladiatorial fight to the death,
the artist either wins or loses.

344
00:31:34,652 --> 00:31:37,252
- Are you winning?
- I hope so.

345
00:31:39,052 --> 00:31:40,692
Do you think I'll like it?

346
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:44,492
I think that's possibly too much
to ask for.

347
00:31:44,572 --> 00:31:45,932
But I do take comfort from the fact

348
00:31:46,012 --> 00:31:50,612
that your own work
is so honest and revealing.

349
00:31:50,692 --> 00:31:54,172
Oh, thank you for the compliment.

350
00:31:58,692 --> 00:32:03,452
Well, are there any works
that you're referring to in particular?

351
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:07,012
I was thinking especially
of the Goldfish pond here at Chartwell.

352
00:32:08,972 --> 00:32:12,059
The pond? Why the pond?
It's just a pond.

353
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:13,796
It's very much more than that.

354
00:32:13,852 --> 00:32:17,172
As borne out by the fact that you've
returned to it again and again.

355
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:18,252
More than 20 times.

356
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:21,652
Well, yes,
because it's such a technical challenge.

357
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:25,692
- It eludes me.
- Well, perhaps you elude yourself, sir.

358
00:32:25,772 --> 00:32:28,892
That's why it's more revealing
than a self-portrait.

359
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:31,252
Oh, that's nonsense.

360
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:35,172
It's the water, the play of light.

361
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:40,052
The trickery. The fish, down below.

362
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:41,892
I think all our work
is unintentionally revealing

363
00:32:41,972 --> 00:32:44,412
and I find it especially so
with your pond.

364
00:32:44,492 --> 00:32:48,372
Beneath the tranquility and the elegance
and the light playing on the surface,

365
00:32:48,452 --> 00:32:52,292
I saw honesty and pain, terrible pain.

366
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:56,132
The framing itself,
indicated to me that you wanted us

367
00:32:56,212 --> 00:32:59,012
to see something

368
00:32:59,092 --> 00:33:02,892
beneath all the muted colors,
deep down in the water.

369
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:06,005
Terrible despair.

370
00:33:06,745 --> 00:33:09,556
Hiding like a Leviathan.
Like a sea monster.

371
00:33:10,692 --> 00:33:14,212
- You saw all that?
- Yes, I did.

372
00:33:15,652 --> 00:33:17,732
Perhaps that says more about you than me?

373
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:19,252
Mm-hmm.

374
00:33:20,252 --> 00:33:21,412
Perhaps.

375
00:33:24,532 --> 00:33:27,412
May I ask you a question, Mr. Sutherland?

376
00:33:27,492 --> 00:33:28,652
Hmm.

377
00:33:28,732 --> 00:33:34,092
It's about one of your paintings.
The one you call "Pastoral."

378
00:33:34,172 --> 00:33:38,212
With all that gnarled and twisted wood.

379
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:41,812
Those great ugly dabs of black.

380
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:47,532
I found something malevolent in it.

381
00:33:47,612 --> 00:33:49,292
Where did that come from?

382
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:55,732
Well, that's very perceptive.
That was a very dark time. My...

383
00:33:57,212 --> 00:34:02,292
My son, John, passed away,
aged two months.

384
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:09,652
Oh, my. I am sorry.

385
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:17,052
Yes. Thank you.

386
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,412
- You have five, yes?
- Four.

387
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:41,092
Marigold was the fifth.

388
00:34:42,572 --> 00:34:44,985
She left us at age

389
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,436
two years, nine months. Septicemia.

390
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:50,332
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

391
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:56,652
We settled on the name Marigold,

392
00:34:56,732 --> 00:35:01,132
on account of her wonderful golden curls.

393
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:03,572
The most extraordinary color.

394
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:09,452
Regretfully,
but though perhaps mercifully,

395
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:13,452
I was not present when she died.

396
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:16,532
When I came home, Clemmie...

397
00:35:18,172 --> 00:35:21,372
roared like a wounded animal.

398
00:35:28,372 --> 00:35:34,292
We bought Chartwell
a year after Marigold died.

399
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:37,972
That was when I put in the...

400
00:35:41,012 --> 00:35:42,252
the pond.

401
00:36:08,652 --> 00:36:09,652
Here.

402
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:13,332
Thank you.

403
00:36:25,612 --> 00:36:28,092
Well, thank you.

404
00:36:29,852 --> 00:36:31,012
It was a pleasure.

405
00:36:36,332 --> 00:36:38,852
I look forward to seeing it.

406
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:21,772
- Hello.
- Hello.

407
00:37:21,852 --> 00:37:24,452
- Shall we?
- Yes.

408
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,252
Given this is Aureole's debut,
and we want to leave nothing to chance,

409
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,612
I've called up three different mares.

410
00:37:33,692 --> 00:37:37,372
Very rarely does a forced tryst
make a fruitful tryst.

411
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:38,692
If one wants the perfect foal,

412
00:37:38,772 --> 00:37:41,292
one needs to be prepared
to wait for the perfect pairing.

413
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:42,412
Shall we?

414
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:45,732
- Meet Neocracy.
- Oh, the Aga Khan's horse.

415
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:46,692
- Indeed.
- Yes.

416
00:37:46,772 --> 00:37:49,092
Recently retired
with a good record as a winner.

417
00:37:49,172 --> 00:37:51,452
Lovely temperament, too.

418
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:52,732
My only concern would be,

419
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,212
- is she perhaps a little too...
- Bashful?

420
00:37:56,092 --> 00:37:59,812
I'm worried that if we left these two
to it, nothing would ever happen.

421
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:02,212
Which is why I've also called up
Turkish Blood.

422
00:38:03,212 --> 00:38:05,612
- An altogether different proposition.
- Indeed.

423
00:38:05,692 --> 00:38:08,332
Strong, willful,
with a terrific track record herself.

424
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:12,092
It really would be breeding
the best with the best.

425
00:38:12,172 --> 00:38:13,652
I'm sensing a "but".

426
00:38:13,732 --> 00:38:17,052
From memory, your Aureole
is something of a sensitive soul.

427
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:19,692
I'd hate him to be intimidated
or come unstuck

428
00:38:19,772 --> 00:38:21,812
when faced with a fiery warrior
like this.

429
00:38:21,892 --> 00:38:23,532
Very considerate of you, Porchey.

430
00:38:23,612 --> 00:38:26,332
Which is why I have a good feeling
about our third candidate.

431
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:28,772
Feast your eyes on Temple Bar.

432
00:38:28,852 --> 00:38:31,652
A hot thoroughbred
with a winning streak herself.

433
00:38:31,732 --> 00:38:34,119
She's a little on the young side,
perhaps.

434
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:35,076
Just three.

435
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:36,932
We don't mind that, do we?

436
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:45,892
- Immediate engagement.
- Yes. I must say, I do like this one.

437
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:49,292
It would appear the feeling is mutual.

438
00:38:50,732 --> 00:38:52,972
You're lovely.

439
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:56,252
<i>Telegrams have been pouring</i>
<i>into Downing Street today</i>

440
00:38:56,332 --> 00:38:59,932
<i>to wish Sir Winston Churchill,
a happy 80th birthday</i>

441
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:02,492
<i>on this the 30th of November.</i>

442
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:03,772
<i>They come from all...</i>

443
00:39:07,372 --> 00:39:12,052
Happy birthday, my darling old pug.

444
00:40:03,412 --> 00:40:05,292
- Oh, is it time?
- It is, Ma'am.

445
00:40:05,372 --> 00:40:06,452
Right.

446
00:40:13,972 --> 00:40:15,812
- Do sit down, Michael.
- Thank you, Ma'am.

447
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:19,532
<i>Westminster Hall, silent witness</i>
<i>of nearly a thousand years of history,</i>

448
00:40:19,612 --> 00:40:23,212
<i>was the scene of the birthday
presentations to Sir Winston.</i>

449
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:19,892
I am deeply honored to be here today.

450
00:41:19,972 --> 00:41:22,972
No politician

451
00:41:23,052 --> 00:41:26,132
has ever received such an honor before.

452
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:28,892
And I am deeply grateful.

453
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:31,252
<i>I am aware, however,</i>

454
00:41:31,332 --> 00:41:34,132
<i>that after having served my country,</i>

455
00:41:34,212 --> 00:41:38,652
for 54 of my 80 years...

456
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:43,332
"resignation"...

457
00:41:44,412 --> 00:41:48,452
Is a word that hangs in the air.

458
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:53,092
And indeed,
it is the perfect occasion for it,

459
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:57,572
and the stage is set
and the audience is assembled,

460
00:41:57,652 --> 00:42:03,172
all ready for a grand valediction.

461
00:42:03,252 --> 00:42:07,012
There's only one problem,
the lead actor has forgotten his lines.

462
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:13,652
And instead of standing down,
he is taking an encore.

463
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:18,652
Oh, dear, he's playing with them all.

464
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:22,652
When your political colleagues
are kind enough

465
00:42:22,732 --> 00:42:28,012
to present you with a portrait
by an ambitious modernist...

466
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:31,772
one has to ask oneself,

467
00:42:31,852 --> 00:42:35,692
"Is it a gift, or is it a curse?"

468
00:42:42,332 --> 00:42:46,372
Mr. Sutherland, the artist, and I

469
00:42:46,452 --> 00:42:49,492
spoke a great deal during my sittings.

470
00:42:49,572 --> 00:42:53,412
I reminded him of the stakes involved.

471
00:42:53,492 --> 00:42:56,532
That his portrait was not just of me,

472
00:42:56,612 --> 00:43:00,532
but of the office I represent.

473
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:04,292
Indeed,
of our entire system of government.

474
00:43:05,492 --> 00:43:08,252
So, at long last,

475
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:11,972
I look forward to unveiling
this painting.

476
00:43:43,252 --> 00:43:47,292
A fine, patriotic piece of modern art.

477
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:21,892
<i>Why are you here?</i>

478
00:44:22,892 --> 00:44:24,652
I understand you've rejected
the painting.

479
00:44:24,732 --> 00:44:27,612
- I have.
- On what grounds?

480
00:44:27,692 --> 00:44:30,932
That is not a painting.
It's a humiliation!

481
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:34,972
"How shall I paint him today?"

482
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:38,772
"Ah! Sitting on a chair,
producing a stool."

483
00:44:39,892 --> 00:44:45,172
"A broken, sagging, pitiful creature,
squeezing and squeezing!"

484
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:48,652
- That's not how it's being seen.
- That is how it is.

485
00:44:48,732 --> 00:44:52,412
- And I will not accept it.
- I don't think it's wise to reject it.

486
00:44:52,492 --> 00:44:55,212
It was commissioned by the members
of the joint Houses of Parliament

487
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,292
as a sign of respect.

488
00:44:56,372 --> 00:44:59,412
Well, then they should have commissioned
an artist who is respectful,

489
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:03,172
instead of a Judas
wielding his murderous brush.

490
00:45:03,252 --> 00:45:07,372
Look at it!
It is a betrayal of friendship.

491
00:45:07,452 --> 00:45:09,972
And an unpatriotic, treacherous,

492
00:45:10,052 --> 00:45:13,972
cowardly assault
by the individualistic left.

493
00:45:14,052 --> 00:45:16,652
- As regards the friendship...
- Clearly there is none.

494
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:21,332
I accepted this commission
because I admired you

495
00:45:21,412 --> 00:45:24,092
and I came through the experience
admiring you even more.

496
00:45:24,172 --> 00:45:26,252
You make monsters of everyone you admire?

497
00:45:27,572 --> 00:45:31,772
It's not vindictive.
It's art. It's not personal.

498
00:45:31,852 --> 00:45:36,012
Well, you are a lost soul.

499
00:45:36,092 --> 00:45:38,492
A narcissist without direction
or certainty.

500
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:43,532
Please, sir.
Don't overreact. Give it time.

501
00:45:43,612 --> 00:45:45,572
I showed those sketches
to your wife throughout.

502
00:45:45,652 --> 00:45:48,612
- She remarked on how accurate they were.
- That is the whole point.

503
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:51,972
It is not a reasonably
truthful image of me!

504
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:54,972
- It is, sir.
- It is not! It is cruel!

505
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,972
Age is cruel!

506
00:46:03,212 --> 00:46:05,092
If you see decay,
it's because there's decay.

507
00:46:05,172 --> 00:46:07,652
If you see frailty,
it's because there's frailty.

508
00:46:09,612 --> 00:46:11,612
I can't be blamed for what is.

509
00:46:12,532 --> 00:46:16,972
And I refuse to hide
and disguise what I see.

510
00:46:18,972 --> 00:46:24,132
If you're engaged in a fight with
something, then it's not with me.

511
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,132
It's with your own blindness.

512
00:46:41,612 --> 00:46:43,172
I think you should go.

513
00:47:24,852 --> 00:47:25,852
<i>He's right.</i>

514
00:47:27,492 --> 00:47:31,532
- What?
- I am that man in the painting.

515
00:47:33,612 --> 00:47:36,212
<i>Wretched and decaying.</i>

516
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:40,372
- I cannot go on.
- You've said that before.

517
00:47:44,652 --> 00:47:46,972
<i>This time I mean it. I'm tired.</i>

518
00:47:50,852 --> 00:47:52,172
You've had enough?

519
00:47:54,332 --> 00:47:55,852
<i>I have, my love.</i>

520
00:48:00,132 --> 00:48:02,252
This time I really have.

521
00:48:03,692 --> 00:48:04,692
Good.

522
00:48:45,892 --> 00:48:47,452
Of course, I knew it was coming.

523
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,732
And if I'm being frank,
there were one or two moments

524
00:48:52,812 --> 00:48:54,652
when I might have even hoped for it, too.

525
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:57,532
Prayed, no doubt.

526
00:49:04,812 --> 00:49:07,452
You really have been the most remarkable
servant to your country.

527
00:49:07,532 --> 00:49:11,972
- Thank you, Ma'am.
- No, Winston, on behalf of us all...

528
00:49:13,252 --> 00:49:14,292
thank you.

529
00:49:18,452 --> 00:49:21,452
- And you wish for Mr. Eden to take over?
- I do.

530
00:49:21,532 --> 00:49:23,612
Well, that will make him happy.

531
00:49:23,692 --> 00:49:28,452
For a day or two,
he might even stop cursing me.

532
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:33,332
Then he will be overwhelmed by a job
in which no man can ever succeed,

533
00:49:33,412 --> 00:49:36,372
and curse me again for leaving it to him.

534
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:40,892
It might be an idea not to tell him that
before he starts.

535
00:49:40,972 --> 00:49:42,012
No, Ma'am.

536
00:49:44,932 --> 00:49:45,972
So...

537
00:49:48,092 --> 00:49:50,012
This is our last audience?

538
00:49:58,372 --> 00:49:59,692
Yes.

539
00:50:04,092 --> 00:50:05,932
However will I cope without you?

540
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,012
You will be fine, Ma'am.

541
00:50:10,452 --> 00:50:16,172
I have nothing more to teach you.
Which is why it's time for me to leave.

542
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,052
Your Majesty.

543
00:51:16,892 --> 00:51:17,892
Stop.

544
00:51:57,412 --> 00:52:00,612
Renaming London Airport?

545
00:52:00,692 --> 00:52:03,772
I want something more personal
for Winston.

546
00:52:06,812 --> 00:52:08,172
What about dinner?

547
00:52:08,252 --> 00:52:11,332
- Here? Or Buckingham Palace?
- No, there.

548
00:52:11,412 --> 00:52:13,332
- Downing Street?
- Yes.

549
00:52:13,412 --> 00:52:17,212
It would be quite the compliment.
You and Philip go there for dinner.

550
00:52:18,772 --> 00:52:19,972
I'll ask Philip.

551
00:52:20,052 --> 00:52:22,772
- No, you'll tell Philip.
- Mummy.

552
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:26,692
Dinner? Downing Street?
Oh, God! Why not?

553
00:52:28,772 --> 00:52:30,372
Is she a looker, do you think?

554
00:52:31,812 --> 00:52:35,012
I mean, if I were a stallion,
would I fancy her?

555
00:52:35,092 --> 00:52:39,452
Attraction isn't so much about looks
as smell.

556
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:42,772
- Oh, I see. Well, does she smell good?
- Well, we'll see, won't we?

557
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:46,372
Come on. Come on.

558
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:54,292
Rather like us, darling,
when we were courting.

559
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:56,972
- Gently, gently, come on.
- Shh. Will you please be quiet?

560
00:52:58,732 --> 00:53:01,132
- Yeah, look. There we go!
- All right.

561
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:02,892
All right.

562
00:53:05,732 --> 00:53:08,772
- Hold her steady.
- Steady.

563
00:53:11,252 --> 00:53:13,972
Oi, oi. I'll say.

564
00:53:19,492 --> 00:53:20,652
Back off.

565
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:24,252
- Yes, there we go.
- Good girl.

566
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:26,252
Good boy.

567
00:53:27,772 --> 00:53:28,572
Is that it?

568
00:53:31,052 --> 00:53:32,812
2,000 guineas for that?

569
00:53:32,892 --> 00:53:36,732
As long as he's done what he needs to do,
and it bears fruit, I don't mind.

570
00:53:36,812 --> 00:53:38,812
Well done, Porchey!

571
00:53:40,212 --> 00:53:44,612
Yes, indeed. Well done, Porchey.

572
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:47,092
I hear he's been given a direct line.

573
00:53:47,172 --> 00:53:48,292
- Who?
- Porchey.

574
00:53:48,372 --> 00:53:49,972
So he can call straight in.

575
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:52,492
I know only because I tried to
get one for Mike and was refused.

576
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:55,052
Yes.

577
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:57,252
On account of him
not being a family member.

578
00:53:57,332 --> 00:54:00,412
- Porchey is like family.
- Is he?

579
00:54:00,492 --> 00:54:03,332
Yes. Part of the furniture.

580
00:54:05,092 --> 00:54:07,732
Well, as long as you don't sit on him
anytime soon.

581
00:54:18,492 --> 00:54:21,572
- Well, that all seemed to go well.
- Yes, it did, didn't it?

582
00:54:23,612 --> 00:54:24,652
Are you all right?

583
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:28,372
Mm.

584
00:54:51,852 --> 00:54:55,052
- Can you leave us now, please?
- Yes, Ma'am.

585
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:14,132
I have nothing to hide from you. Nothing.

586
00:55:16,972 --> 00:55:18,492
Porchey is a friend.

587
00:55:21,572 --> 00:55:25,292
And yes, there are those
who would have preferred me to marry him.

588
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:28,212
Indeed, marriage with him
might have been easier.

589
00:55:29,892 --> 00:55:32,092
Might have even worked better than ours.

590
00:55:35,252 --> 00:55:37,812
But to everyone's regret
and frustration...

591
00:55:39,332 --> 00:55:42,172
the only person I have ever loved is you.

592
00:55:44,892 --> 00:55:48,732
And can you honestly look me in the eye
and say the same?

593
00:55:57,892 --> 00:55:58,932
Can you?

594
00:56:12,892 --> 00:56:17,292
Pray silence for Her Majesty, the Queen.

595
00:56:24,132 --> 00:56:27,932
My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen.

596
00:56:28,012 --> 00:56:30,972
Dear Winston and Lady Churchill.

597
00:56:35,372 --> 00:56:39,852
My confidence in Sir Anthony is complete.

598
00:56:39,932 --> 00:56:43,252
And I know he will lead the country
on to great achievements,

599
00:56:44,732 --> 00:56:50,212
but it would be useless to pretend
that either he or any of those successors

600
00:56:50,292 --> 00:56:52,972
who may one day follow him in office,

601
00:56:53,052 --> 00:56:55,172
will ever, for me,

602
00:56:55,252 --> 00:56:59,252
be able to hold the place
of my first Prime Minister,

603
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:02,212
to whom my husband and I owe so much.

604
00:57:03,972 --> 00:57:07,932
And for whose wise guidance,
during the early years of my reign,

605
00:57:08,012 --> 00:57:11,612
I shall always be so profoundly grateful.

606
00:57:11,692 --> 00:57:12,852
Hear, hear!

607
00:57:18,252 --> 00:57:22,212
I will remember you always
for your magnanimity,

608
00:57:23,572 --> 00:57:25,772
your courage at all times.

609
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:34,692
And for your unfailing humor.

610
00:57:34,772 --> 00:57:39,252
Founded in your unrivalled mastery
of the English language.

611
00:57:41,572 --> 00:57:47,572
<i>I take comfort from the fact, that
in losing my constitutional adviser...</i>

612
00:57:49,172 --> 00:57:51,932
<i>I gain a wise counsellor...</i>

613
00:57:55,052 --> 00:57:58,292
to whom I shall look
for help and support...

614
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,252
in the days which lie ahead.

615
00:58:07,852 --> 00:58:11,172
- May there be many of them.
- Hear, hear.
