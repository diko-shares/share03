-=THE LAST FANTASY=-

00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:55.134


3
00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:05.249
(voice-mail) Hi, you've reached the office of Dr. Stuart Price.

4
00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.650
Please note the office will be closed until the 24th.

5
00:01:07.794 --> 00:01:09.243
If this is an emergency, please try...

6
00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:17.055
(voice-mail) Hi! This is Dr. Stu Price. I'm getting married.

7
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.276
So I'll be out of the country for 2 weeks.

8
00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:22.289
I'm not sure if I'll have cell service.

9
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:22.864
If this is a dental emergency...

10
00:01:23.908 --> 00:01:27.046
Nothing.

11
00:01:27.346 --> 00:01:31.186
(speaking in Thai)

12
00:01:32.077 --> 00:01:34.467
Daddy, please! You're not helping!

13
00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:38.510
I looked into his eyes. Not the eyes of a man.

14
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.031
The eyes of a coward.

15
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.038
(speaking in Thai again)

16
00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.857
Excuse me!

17
00:01:51.336 --> 00:01:53.119
- Bill! - Tracy!

18
00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.986
- I'm sorry! - Where the hell are you?

19
00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:01.509
It happened again!

20
00:02:01.596 --> 00:02:04.334
Don't say that, please!

21
00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:06.856
No this time we really fucked up.

22
00:02:06.857 --> 00:02:09.683
Seriously! What is wrong with you three?

23
00:02:09.683 --> 00:02:12.942
So much Trace, I don't even know where to begin.

24
00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:15.508
Oh god! How bad?

25
00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:20.247
- Like, no wedding bad? - Yeah...

26
00:02:20.248 --> 00:02:25.029
a little worse than that.

27
00:02:25.856 --> 00:02:29.680
THE HANGOVER PART II

28
00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:07.197
ONE WEEK EARLIER

29
00:04:07.198 --> 00:04:10.328
Uh, huh.

30
00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.979
- You really need to floss more. - Fuck that! That's why I come here.

31
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.024
- Then you should come more than once every two years!
- Why? So you can bleed me of all my money?

32
00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:21.935
I never charge you a dime, Phil!

33
00:04:21.937 --> 00:04:24.763
- Hey, how do I work the nitrous? - Ah, you don't actually.

34
00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:27.586
Come on! Just one hit!

35
00:04:27.587 --> 00:04:31.413
Fillings look pretty good. Any other problems?

36
00:04:31.414 --> 00:04:35.805
Yeah, actually. You're getting married in Thailand.

37
00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:39.587
For starters, that's flights for me and Steph. That's two grand right there.

38
00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:43.761
Then my mother in laws watching the kids. So now she's got this whole new thing over my head.

39
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:45.804
Plus, takes five days to get there.

40
00:04:45.805 --> 00:04:49.499
It's a 16 hour flight. And it's beautiful when you get there.

41
00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:51.978
- Whatever, it's a hassle! - It is kinda far.

42
00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:54.499
Lauren's been there a week and she's still jet lagged.

43
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.282
But it's where her parents are from and it means a lot to them.

44
00:04:57.283 --> 00:05:00.673
Who gives a shit about her parents! Her dad hates you!

45
00:05:00.673 --> 00:05:04.454
He doesn't hate me! He's just never spoken to me...

46
00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:06.065
...I think it's a cultural thing.

47
00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:09.020
Why can't you just get married in Vegas like you did the last time. It's so much easier.

48
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.932
Why can't you just be excited for me?

49
00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:16.801
This is my wedding!

50
00:05:19.063 --> 00:05:23.931
- You're really happy, huh? - I really am.

51
00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:27.585
Alright...

52
00:05:27.585 --> 00:05:30.323
...I'm happy too.

53
00:05:30.324 --> 00:05:35.191
- Thank you! - Gonna be fun.

54
00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:41.104
Phil. Put the prescription pad back.

55
00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:58.973
- Thank you. You know that's a felony right? - Fuck you, man!

56
00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:04.103
- Was this right up against your scrotum? - Yep.

57
00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:07.060
- Oh my god, I just realized. - What?

58
00:06:07.061 --> 00:06:10.190
- I forgot to renew my passport! - Oh no...

59
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:14.365
Good thing I did it last week. It's in the kitchen drawer.

60
00:06:14.365 --> 00:06:17.711
- You're the best! - Hey! We're a team!

61
00:06:17.713 --> 00:06:22.581
You're a good guy. Like a really good guy!

62
00:06:23.538 --> 00:06:24.929
Thank you!

63
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.320
- So I know you're not gonna get mad. - Mad? What, mad at what?

64
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.884
Alan found out that we're going to Thailand for Stu's wedding.

65
00:06:32.886 --> 00:06:36.581
- So? - So he's heart broken Doug. You guys are like his family!

66
00:06:36.581 --> 00:06:39.622
No. Your family is like his family.

67
00:06:39.623 --> 00:06:42.840
All Alan talks about is the three of you.

68
00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:44.928
- And that weekend. - Wait a second...

69
00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:49.405
- Is he the one who keeps calling and hanging up?
- He does that when he's upset.

70
00:06:49.406 --> 00:06:52.100
He doesn't understand why he's not invited.

71
00:06:52.102 --> 00:06:56.797
Could you just run it by Stu? Just run it by him.

72
00:06:56.798 --> 00:07:00.709
For me...

73
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.187
No fucking way! Absolutely not!

74
00:07:03.188 --> 00:07:06.187
Come on Stu, it's killing him.

75
00:07:06.187 --> 00:07:10.230
Honestly, the two of you were barely invited.

76
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:13.144
I get it. I really do. It's just, you know what...

77
00:07:13.145 --> 00:07:15.362
Alan considers you to be one of his best friends.

78
00:07:15.362 --> 00:07:17.447
I consider Alan to be insane.

79
00:07:17.448 --> 00:07:20.968
Stu, throw him a bone! We've already said he's got to pay for everything he eats and everything he breaks.

80
00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:24.056
You know what. We should see if we can squeeze the old man to cover the bachelor party.

81
00:07:24.057 --> 00:07:26.316
- That's good. - I'm glad you brought that up.

82
00:07:26.318 --> 00:07:30.882
- Because... this is the bachelor party! - What?

83
00:07:30.882 --> 00:07:34.098
- What are you talking about? - Yeah, it's my bachelor brunch!

84
00:07:34.098 --> 00:07:38.924
Go crazy. Get some chocolate chip pancakes... a lap dance from the waitress...

85
00:07:39.448 --> 00:07:44.185
That's bullshit! You can't just skip out of a bachelor party, Stu.

86
00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:48.097
You see that? That's orange juice with a napkin on top.

87
00:07:48.098 --> 00:07:50.880
Do you know why? So nobody roofies me.

88
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.793
Why I refuse to eat fucking cantaloupe at a bachelor party?

89
00:07:53.795 --> 00:07:58.663
- C'mon Stu. Don't you think you're over reacting? - No, I don't.

90
00:07:58.664 --> 00:08:03.445
I'm still putting the pieces of my broken psyche back together.

91
00:08:04.098 --> 00:08:08.879
And you know what the glue is? Lauren! I'm not doing anything to screw that up.

92
00:08:09.618 --> 00:08:12.966
- Oh, please. You wouldn't even be with her if it wasn't for us. - Oh, this'll be good.

93
00:08:12.967 --> 00:08:14.617
Stu, think about it!

94
00:08:14.618 --> 00:08:17.792
You ended up ditching Melissa, and two years later you met your true soul mate.

95
00:08:17.792 --> 00:08:22.703
You take Vegas out of that equation, you would have married a cunt.

96
00:08:22.967 --> 00:08:25.226
Oh that's ok. I'm allowed to say it. It's a bachelor party.

97
00:08:25.227 --> 00:08:26.792
Drink up everybody.

98
00:08:26.792 --> 00:08:29.834
Oh wait, there's no alcohol! I forgot we're at a fuckin IHOP!

99
00:08:29.836 --> 00:08:33.053
Well it's my decision and it's final, so...how bout a toast?

100
00:08:33.053 --> 00:08:35.618
This sucks. I'm gonna wait in the car.

101
00:08:35.618 --> 00:08:38.225
- C'mon Phil, where you going? - Doug, Doug, I just don't get it!

102
00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:41.399
He's getting married in Thailand! That's great for him, but what about us?

103
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.008
You're selfish! Come on, sweetheart...

104
00:08:46.008 --> 00:08:50.485
Shame on you!

105
00:08:50.487 --> 00:08:53.355
Don't worry Stu. I will stand up for you no matter what.

106
00:08:53.356 --> 00:08:54.660
Thank you.

107
00:08:54.703 --> 00:08:59.485
But you gotta help me out with this Alan thing.

108
00:08:59.965 --> 00:09:02.528
Guys, I can't tell you how much this means...

109
00:09:02.528 --> 00:09:06.137
Alan's been waiting for the invite ever since he got word of the wedding.

110
00:09:06.138 --> 00:09:07.484
- I'm sure he has. - Yeah.

111
00:09:07.485 --> 00:09:10.703
Been standing outside by the mailbox every day.

112
00:09:10.703 --> 00:09:13.354
- Well that's tough. - Yeah.

113
00:09:13.356 --> 00:09:17.223
I uh, I'm not sure he ever left Vegas.

114
00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:20.614
He really needs this.

115
00:09:20.614 --> 00:09:22.484
What?

116
00:09:22.486 --> 00:09:26.702
Sweetie, papa! You have visitors! Go in slowly.

117
00:09:26.702 --> 00:09:31.570
Give him a chance to acclimate.

118
00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:36.570
- Hey, Alan! - Hey, guys! Hey, Phil!

119
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:40.135
Hey, bud!

120
00:09:40.136 --> 00:09:45.004
- You guys wanna come in? - Sure. Absolutely.

121
00:09:46.788 --> 00:09:49.135
- Hey. - Hey.

122
00:09:49.136 --> 00:09:54.004
- Hey, Stu! - Ok. See you on the court in half...

123
00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:58.829
- Pretty cool room, Alan! - Thanks, Phil! My dad pays my rent.

124
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:02.657
Alan, what the fuck! You were supposed to delete these!

125
00:10:02.657 --> 00:10:04.568
You made a promise!

126
00:10:04.569 --> 00:10:06.090
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

127
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:10.958
What the hell? I'm not cool with this at all. You can't have these.

128
00:10:11.265 --> 00:10:13.350
Relax, Stu! Nobody ever comes in here.

129
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:18.177
- A total violation of trust! - Mother I'm done with my lunch. It's just sitting here!

130
00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.829
I'm sorry, honey. I'll be right up.

131
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:23.871
- I can't believe you guys stopped by. This is really cool. - Wait a second!

132
00:10:23.872 --> 00:10:27.392
- Al, is that Mr. Chow? - Yeah. We still keep in touch.

133
00:10:27.394 --> 00:10:28.481
Stu!

134
00:10:28.482 --> 00:10:31.090
Chow, the guy that kidnapped us?

135
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.046
He didn't kidnap us. He kidnapped Black Doug.

136
00:10:33.046 --> 00:10:35.088
Remember? It was a whole big misunderstanding.

137
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.089
He's actually quite charming.

138
00:10:37.089 --> 00:10:40.348
- Alan, he's a criminal. - Excuse me, boys!

139
00:10:40.349 --> 00:10:42.132
- Hi, Linda! - Hi, Dougie!

140
00:10:42.132 --> 00:10:44.653
I guess we don't do desert anymore. I didn't get that memo.

141
00:10:44.655 --> 00:10:47.784
I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.

142
00:10:47.784 --> 00:10:50.261
Would a cupcake kill you?

143
00:10:50.262 --> 00:10:54.478
- You know, I don't think this was a good idea.
- Alan, we have a little surprise for you.

144
00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:57.479
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

145
00:10:57.479 --> 00:11:01.520
- Well only if you're not busy. - Stu!

146
00:11:01.522 --> 00:11:04.000
Well maybe the Jonas Brothers are in town.

147
00:11:04.001 --> 00:11:08.173
Nope. They're in Raleigh-Durham that weekend.

148
00:11:08.173 --> 00:11:13.041
Are you really being serious, Stu? You're inviting me?

149
00:11:16.391 --> 00:11:21.259
Yeah why not? It's gonna be fun, right?

150
00:11:21.653 --> 00:11:25.478
- Phil, are you going? - Of course!

151
00:11:25.478 --> 00:11:30.216
Then it will be fun.

152
00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:37.738
What the fuck are you doing, man?

153
00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:41.564
It's my immunizations. It's the last day I can do it.

154
00:11:41.565 --> 00:11:43.997
That's supposed to be done by a registered nurse.

155
00:11:43.997 --> 00:11:46.737
I'm a nurse. Just not registered.

156
00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:51.605
Stu, look at this! I bought this cause I thought of you!

157
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:30.039
- Hey, there he is! - Hey, Stu!

158
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.560
- Teddy! What's up? How are ya? - Hey Stu.

159
00:12:34.561 --> 00:12:37.864
- Alright. Who's this guy, Stu? - This is Teddy. Lauren's little brother.

160
00:12:37.864 --> 00:12:40.950
Goes to Stanford. Pre-med. This is Phil, Alan and Doug.

161
00:12:40.952 --> 00:12:42.255
Hey, nice to meet you, man!

162
00:12:42.256 --> 00:12:44.604
Wow, Stanford? How old are you?

163
00:12:44.604 --> 00:12:49.254
- He's 17. Kind of a genius. - Actually, I'm 16.

164
00:12:49.256 --> 00:12:52.691
I'm not a genius. My dad just had me take the entrance exams early.

165
00:12:52.691 --> 00:12:55.081
Because you're a genius.

166
00:12:55.081 --> 00:12:58.254
- So what are you, a doctor? - No, not yet. I'm premed.

167
00:12:58.256 --> 00:13:01.820
- Ever heard of that guy Doogie Howser? - Yeah.

168
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.297
- Well, he turned out to be a gay. - Alan.

169
00:13:05.299 --> 00:13:07.341
It's true, I read it in Teen People.

170
00:13:07.342 --> 00:13:12.037
Right, ok... well I'm gonna grab a book or something for the plane. You guys want anything?

171
00:13:12.037 --> 00:13:15.384
- No, thanks. I'm good. - I would actually love a small water.

172
00:13:15.386 --> 00:13:18.949
Cool.

173
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:21.906
- What's the matter with you. He's 16 years old. - Yeah, Alan. Take it easy!

174
00:13:21.907 --> 00:13:26.166
I'm a little confused. Is he here just to see us off or what. How does this work?

175
00:13:26.168 --> 00:13:29.993
- How does what work? - Is that person coming to the wedding?

176
00:13:29.993 --> 00:13:34.861
Yes Alan. My brides little brother is coming to the wedding. Is that ok with you?

177
00:13:35.819 --> 00:13:40.643
Well, it's the first time I've heard of it. You could have paged me.

178
00:13:42.861 --> 00:13:47.643
Don't over react. It's gonna be fine.

179
00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:53.032
- Hey. Mind if I sit? - Wolf pack only. Find another chair.

180
00:13:53.034 --> 00:13:57.207
- There's no wolfpack, Alan. C'mon. - It's no problem. I'll find...

181
00:13:57.207 --> 00:14:00.684
- Teddy, don't be ridiculous! You're sitting here! - Careful, that's a Louis...

182
00:14:00.686 --> 00:14:05.512
That is a Louis Vuitton!

183
00:14:12.513 --> 00:14:17.250
- That's a nice neck roll! - Thanks! You can use it if you want.

184
00:14:18.599 --> 00:14:23.554
Ok.

185
00:14:23.684 --> 00:14:28.552
The Downeaster 'Alexa'" by Billy Joel playing

186
00:15:29.812 --> 00:15:34.724
Baby!

187
00:15:45.334 --> 00:15:49.810
This is so absolutely beautiful! Thank you much!

188
00:15:49.811 --> 00:15:51.201
Of course.

189
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:56.026
Between Teddy and me, you must be pretty excited. Pretty soon you'll have 2 doctors in the family.

190
00:15:56.115 --> 00:16:00.767
You have to realize that in my country we don't consider dentists to be real doctors.

191
00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:02.504
Dad...

192
00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:03.591
Ok.

193
00:16:03.593 --> 00:16:08.505
Anyway I have to go and talk to Teddy about his cello performance tonight.

194
00:16:09.462 --> 00:16:10.722
Ouch!

195
00:16:10.723 --> 00:16:12.461
I'm so sorry...

196
00:16:12.462 --> 00:16:15.244
Your dad's kind of obsessed with your brother, isn't he?

197
00:16:15.244 --> 00:16:19.764
Teddy is my dad's prize possession. It's always been that way.

198
00:16:19.765 --> 00:16:23.243
He'll warm up, I promise! Okay?

199
00:16:23.245 --> 00:16:26.982
You can just fax it over to me. I'll pick it up at the concierge.

200
00:16:26.982 --> 00:16:29.459
Thanks, papa! Bye bye!

201
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.633
That was my dad. I'm a stay at home son.

202
00:16:32.634 --> 00:16:37.024
We were discussing your wedding gift. He's sparing no expense.

203
00:16:37.025 --> 00:16:39.067
Oh... That's so unnecessary.

204
00:16:39.068 --> 00:16:42.068
I've been meaning to ask someone. I notice this is a fishing village.

205
00:16:42.112 --> 00:16:44.111
Is there a Long John Silver's on the island?

206
00:16:44.112 --> 00:16:47.198
You know. No, I don't think so. I'm so sorry.

207
00:16:47.198 --> 00:16:51.154
But, we are actually serving some great fresh seafood.

208
00:16:51.156 --> 00:16:53.763
- Better than Long John's? - Yes.

209
00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:58.719
- I'll be the judge of that. Enjoy your evening. - You too. Ok.

210
00:17:34.501 --> 00:17:39.456
All right!

211
00:17:42.935 --> 00:17:44.891
Thank you, Teddy!

212
00:17:44.891 --> 00:17:48.064
The hands of a brilliant musician!

213
00:17:48.065 --> 00:17:52.803
And one day, a great surgeon.

214
00:17:52.804 --> 00:17:55.107
I admit it...

215
00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:59.976
When I first met Stu, I was not quite sold.

216
00:18:00.282 --> 00:18:05.150
He seemed unattractive. He lacked intelligence and imagination.

217
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:11.715
He was missing the spark you look for in a man.

218
00:18:12.455 --> 00:18:15.672
But then I looked into Stu's eyes.

219
00:18:15.672 --> 00:18:20.409
It reminded me of my sweet brother, Chai Yo.

220
00:18:20.411 --> 00:18:25.279
For those who do not know, Chai Yo is learning the sailboat and lives in a group home.

221
00:18:28.628 --> 00:18:32.105
But Chai Yo loves "khao" .

222
00:18:32.106 --> 00:18:36.974
And that's when I realized, Stu is "khao".

223
00:18:39.063 --> 00:18:40.801
What is "khao"?

224
00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:44.842
"Khao" is soft white rice in luke warm water.

225
00:18:44.844 --> 00:18:47.235
It has no taste.

226
00:18:47.235 --> 00:18:52.061
We feed it to small baby and uh, very old people.

227
00:18:52.583 --> 00:18:55.887
It is nourishment that everyone can digest.

228
00:18:55.887 --> 00:19:00.798
The world needs "khao", just as the world needs people like Stu.

229
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.581
To my sweet daughter and Stu! Congratulations!

230
00:19:08.582 --> 00:19:13.450
Cheers!

231
00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:18.580
And now I believe that Teddy has something to say.

232
00:19:18.754 --> 00:19:23.666
Sit down! I got this. Sit down, boy!

233
00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:26.754
That was a.. a great speech, sir!

234
00:19:26.754 --> 00:19:31.666
I like the comparison between Stu and rice.

235
00:19:33.494 --> 00:19:37.233
I've also prepared a few words.

236
00:19:37.234 --> 00:19:40.101
Hey everybody. Here's some fun facts.

237
00:19:40.102 --> 00:19:43.840
The population in Thailand is 63 million people.

238
00:19:43.841 --> 00:19:46.449
It is twice the size of Wyoming.

239
00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:50.362
It's chief exports are textiles, footwear and rice.

240
00:19:50.362 --> 00:19:55.230
Each year approximately 13,000 people are killed in car accidents in Thailand.

241
00:19:56.493 --> 00:19:58.534
- The climate in Thailand... - Alan!

242
00:19:58.535 --> 00:20:03.447
- Why don't you skip to the last card there, buddy. - Okay. Sorry!

243
00:20:06.666 --> 00:20:09.492
None of you know Stu like I do.

244
00:20:09.492 --> 00:20:14.360
Not you... not you... not you...

245
00:20:15.362 --> 00:20:20.143
Not nobody knows Stu like I do.

246
00:20:20.143 --> 00:20:22.490
No one!

247
00:20:22.492 --> 00:20:26.229
I can't even tell you what we've been through cause we made a pact.

248
00:20:26.229 --> 00:20:28.663
More important than blood.

249
00:20:28.664 --> 00:20:33.489
What I can tell you is this. This is not Stu's first marriage.

250
00:20:33.925 --> 00:20:37.316
There was a whore in Las Vegas a couple of years ago.

251
00:20:37.316 --> 00:20:41.401
Sit down...

252
00:20:41.403 --> 00:20:46.229
- Enough! He'll get over it! - Okay. Thanks, Phil!

253
00:20:54.663 --> 00:20:59.574
In your face!

254
00:20:59.837 --> 00:21:03.619
Well that was exactly as painful as I expected it to be.

255
00:21:03.619 --> 00:21:06.792
Sorry...

256
00:21:06.794 --> 00:21:10.228
- Oh, rice pudding! What are you doing? - HaHa. Very funny!

257
00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:12.792
Be nice, Phil! He's extra sensitive tonight.

258
00:21:12.792 --> 00:21:16.313
Get over it! He's your father in law. He's supposed to hate you.

259
00:21:16.315 --> 00:21:18.706
Come have a drink with me and the guys.

260
00:21:18.706 --> 00:21:23.573
You know... I'm really exhausted. We're just gonna go upstairs and crash.

261
00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:26.922
C'mon, I just spoke with the manager. He's gonna let us have a bonfire on the beach.

262
00:21:26.922 --> 00:21:30.921
That sounds fun!

263
00:21:30.921 --> 00:21:33.007
- Nyah... I'm good. - He's tired!

264
00:21:33.009 --> 00:21:36.225
Stu, one drink with your friends who came all this way.

265
00:21:36.225 --> 00:21:39.442
- I just wanna hang out with you! - Oh c'mon. Just go! And do me a favor.

266
00:21:39.442 --> 00:21:43.876
Take Teddy with you. He never gets to have any fun.

267
00:21:43.877 --> 00:21:46.529
That is a great idea. Bring the kid.

268
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.572
- Alright. One drink! - Perfect.

269
00:21:49.573 --> 00:21:51.528
- See you later. - Have fun!

270
00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.704
- You have the key? - Yep, got it right here!

271
00:21:54.704 --> 00:21:59.529
I'll see you in 20 minutes!

272
00:21:59.877 --> 00:22:03.572
My uncle Roger said that he once saw an albino polar bear.

273
00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:08.441
Really? Polar bears are white. How would he know if it's an albino?

274
00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.093
This one was black.

275
00:22:14.093 --> 00:22:19.005
Did you ever think maybe it was just a black bear?

276
00:22:20.745 --> 00:22:22.657
Whatever...

277
00:22:22.658 --> 00:22:27.005
Ok. Here we go. American beer.

278
00:22:27.006 --> 00:22:31.743
- Sealed bottle! - Thank you. Alright!

279
00:22:31.744 --> 00:22:34.961
- I'm not really old enough to drink. - Yeah, it's illegal.

280
00:22:34.962 --> 00:22:37.527
Would be a shame if somebody reported you.

281
00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:41.830
Nobody's reporting anybody. It's fine Teddy. Have a little fun.

282
00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:43.352
Careful!

283
00:22:43.353 --> 00:22:47.394
What is this? Instant marshmallows? Nice touch!

284
00:22:47.396 --> 00:22:51.570
- That was Alan's idea. - Good thinking, Al!

285
00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:56.351
You know... I gotta hand it to you, Stu! This place is paradise.

286
00:22:56.352 --> 00:22:57.655
Not bad, right?

287
00:22:57.656 --> 00:23:02.393
And I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually jealous of you.

288
00:23:02.394 --> 00:23:06.045
- I mean, Lauren is an angel. - Yeah, she really is amazing.

289
00:23:06.046 --> 00:23:07.697
Wow, you guys are sweet.

290
00:23:07.698 --> 00:23:12.610
Not big breasts on her. But still, solid rack for an Asian.

291
00:23:13.003 --> 00:23:16.003
- Sorry, Teddy, but it's true. - That's ok.

292
00:23:16.003 --> 00:23:18.220
That is just wildly inappropriate.

293
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:23.132
And yet... I'm really glad you're here. All you guys. Even you Alan.

294
00:23:25.481 --> 00:23:28.827
It means a lot that you made the trip. Thank you.

295
00:23:28.829 --> 00:23:31.524
- Wouldn't have missed it buddy. - Great!

296
00:23:31.525 --> 00:23:36.350
Now. Can we have our one fucking beer, dad?

297
00:23:36.394 --> 00:23:40.349
Alright. Toast! C'mon stand up guys.

298
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.523
Come over here, Alan!

299
00:23:43.523 --> 00:23:46.174
To Lauren and Stu!

300
00:23:46.176 --> 00:23:49.957
- You did it, buddy. - Sure did.

301
00:23:49.957 --> 00:23:54.825
Cheers!

302
00:25:08.083 --> 00:25:12.995
What the hell...

303
00:25:49.428 --> 00:25:54.296
What?

304
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.861
Phil...

305
00:26:18.863 --> 00:26:21.731
I think it happened again.

306
00:26:21.732 --> 00:26:26.557
- Alan, what the fuck did you do? - I didn't do anything. I swear to god.

307
00:26:26.994 --> 00:26:30.384
Your hair is gone.

308
00:26:30.384 --> 00:26:35.426
No, no... up.

309
00:26:40.991 --> 00:26:45.816
Where the fuck are we?

310
00:26:51.512 --> 00:26:56.337
Phil, I'm scared.

311
00:27:04.729 --> 00:27:09.597
Stu, c'mon get up! We got a situation.

312
00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:21.292
- Oh, holy shit! - Where are we?

313
00:27:22.858 --> 00:27:27.640
- Oh my god, Alan. Your head. - No your head!

314
00:27:28.467 --> 00:27:32.683
- Is it bald? - Stu, you're gonna freak out, but it's gonna be ok.

315
00:27:32.684 --> 00:27:36.510
- Why? Was it my teeth? - Nope, it's not your teeth.

316
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.205
- Are you sure? - Yep.

317
00:27:38.207 --> 00:27:42.726
Can you see the bottom?

318
00:27:42.726 --> 00:27:47.638
Oh my god! What the fu...ck

319
00:27:49.248 --> 00:27:52.422
That's good. Why don't you try to wash it off.

320
00:27:52.422 --> 00:27:57.203
It's not coming off. This is a real tattoo!

321
00:27:58.073 --> 00:28:01.464
- Alan, what did you do! Did you Roofie me? - I didn't do anything!

322
00:28:01.465 --> 00:28:05.333
Stu, he swore to god!

323
00:28:05.378 --> 00:28:10.072
What happened?

324
00:28:10.117 --> 00:28:14.984
Get it off of me!

325
00:28:15.683 --> 00:28:18.769
- What the hell? - It's a monkey.

326
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:22.419
What a cute little mask. Hi little monkey.

327
00:28:22.421 --> 00:28:27.376
Alan...

328
00:28:27.464 --> 00:28:31.983
Phone! Alan, go find the phone!

329
00:28:31.985 --> 00:28:34.550
I got it!

330
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.810
- Doug, where the hell are you? - I'm at breakfast. By the pool.

331
00:28:37.811 --> 00:28:42.113
- You guys coming down or what? - Oh Jesus. Thank god. Doug's fine.

332
00:28:42.115 --> 00:28:46.332
- Stu, Doug's fine. He's at the resort. - Why aren't we at the resort.

333
00:28:46.332 --> 00:28:47.941
What's going on? Where are you guys?

334
00:28:47.941 --> 00:28:51.896
I do not know, man! We woke up in some shit hole room in some city.

335
00:28:51.898 --> 00:28:55.592
- Oh god. What city? - I don't know, Doug!

336
00:28:55.592 --> 00:28:58.460
Fuckin Asia-town.

337
00:28:58.462 --> 00:29:03.288
- I do not know, I told you. - Where are we?

338
00:29:06.723 --> 00:29:09.548
- Hey Stu. - What?

339
00:29:09.548 --> 00:29:10.158
Check this out.

340
00:29:12.677 --> 00:29:14.329
Ever seen anything like this?

341
00:29:22.374 --> 00:29:26.373
- What is that? - Careful. Might be a spiders nest.

342
00:29:26.418 --> 00:29:28.939
I've tangled with those before.

343
00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.765
I don't get it man. We each had one beer last night, right? I mean you too!

344
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.765
- Yeah but I left early, remember? - I don't remember shit!

345
00:29:37.765 --> 00:29:40.763
Tracy wasn't feeling well. She came down to get me.

346
00:29:40.763 --> 00:29:44.937
- Wait and second. Is Teddy with you guys? - Teddy? What? What are you talking about?

347
00:29:44.938 --> 00:29:47.849
He wasn't in his room. They've been looking for him all morning.

348
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:50.850
- Teddy went to Stanford, right? - Yeah. Why?

349
00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:54.370
Fuck!

350
00:29:54.372 --> 00:29:58.154
- I just found his finger! - What?

351
00:29:58.154 --> 00:30:03.110
- I just found his fucking finger, Doug! - Phil, what is going on?

352
00:30:03.546 --> 00:30:07.457
Alright. Alright, alright... this is what we're gonna do.

353
00:30:07.457 --> 00:30:10.717
You tell the girls that we woke up early and went on a fishing trip, ok. And that's where we are.

354
00:30:10.719 --> 00:30:15.022
- Right. - Right, stay by the phone!

355
00:30:15.023 --> 00:30:19.804
Shit!

356
00:30:19.805 --> 00:30:23.717
Uh, we got a little bit of a problem.

357
00:30:23.718 --> 00:30:26.239
What is that?

358
00:30:26.239 --> 00:30:28.933
We don't know.

359
00:30:28.935 --> 00:30:33.717
- Is it a worm? - It's a mushroom.

360
00:30:34.718 --> 00:30:37.543
Yeah, shiitake.

361
00:30:37.544 --> 00:30:40.674
Monkey, taste it! Is it shiitake?

362
00:30:40.674 --> 00:30:45.368
- He can't understand you. - He just did.

363
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.802
- Why is he pulling on it? - He's probably hungry.

364
00:30:48.803 --> 00:30:51.281
Wait a second. Is that...

365
00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:56.107
What the fuck man. Tell that gay monkey to leave my shit alone.

366
00:30:56.325 --> 00:30:57.716
Chow?

367
00:30:57.716 --> 00:31:00.716
You're fucking crazy.

368
00:31:00.716 --> 00:31:05.583
It's so fucking light in here! Alan, grab me my sunglasses!

369
00:31:06.715 --> 00:31:11.583
- It's great to see you, Leslie! - Nice to see you too my little popo.

370
00:31:11.759 --> 00:31:13.715
Chow, what the fuck are you doing here?

371
00:31:13.716 --> 00:31:17.410
Alan called me a few days ago and invited me to the wedding.

372
00:31:17.411 --> 00:31:19.714
- Excuse me? - What, he's my plus one.

373
00:31:19.714 --> 00:31:22.366
You don't have plus one. It's $200 a plate.

374
00:31:22.368 --> 00:31:25.670
Guys, guys. Just focus, ok. -Chow, what happened?

375
00:31:25.671 --> 00:31:30.496
You guys texted me, said you're fucked up and looking to party.

376
00:31:36.367 --> 00:31:39.713
I picked you up on my boat and I brought you here to Bangkok.

377
00:31:39.714 --> 00:31:42.451
But we had a sick night, bitches!

378
00:31:42.452 --> 00:31:47.364
Wait a second Chow,  we're in Bangkok?

379
00:31:47.582 --> 00:31:50.930
Holler, city of squalor.

380
00:31:50.931 --> 00:31:55.756
- Do you know how I got this tattoo? - Uh, yeah from a fucking tattoo guy!

381
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.928
Come on Stu, use that big Jewish brain.

382
00:31:58.929 --> 00:32:03.581
What's the monkey holding?

383
00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:07.753
- That's a finger! - Stu, I got some bad news.

384
00:32:07.755 --> 00:32:12.623
Teddy was with us last night. That's his finger.

385
00:32:13.711 --> 00:32:18.536
- Teddy's dead? - Teddy's not dead! He partied with us all night!

386
00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:22.927
- Well then where is he? - Don't you remember anything?

387
00:32:22.929 --> 00:32:26.320
- No! - No, nothing, Chow.

388
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.493
Ok I explain it all, ok?

389
00:32:29.493 --> 00:32:34.361
Just let me do one bump, get my head straight. Come to papa.

390
00:32:34.494 --> 00:32:39.405
That's a big...

391
00:32:42.276 --> 00:32:47.231
You ready for craziest fucking story ever...

392
00:32:56.319 --> 00:32:59.665
Chow!

393
00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:04.360
Hey Chow, you okay?

394
00:33:04.361 --> 00:33:09.229
You gotta be kidding me.

395
00:33:12.491 --> 00:33:17.359
Fuck, he's dead!

396
00:33:20.752 --> 00:33:22.837
- Help! - Stu!

397
00:33:22.838 --> 00:33:26.141
- Help! - Stu, shut up!

398
00:33:26.142 --> 00:33:29.097
- Call an ambulance! - Shut up! He's dead!

399
00:33:29.098 --> 00:33:32.012
Look if someone comes and finds a dead body and a pile of cocaine...

400
00:33:32.013 --> 00:33:36.229
We're gonna spend the rest of our fucking lives in a Thai prison.

401
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:40.315
Alan! Please don't cry!

402
00:33:40.315 --> 00:33:45.097
Alright. Alright. I just need a second to figure this out.

403
00:34:01.011 --> 00:34:05.878
ICE MACHINE LOCATED ON 15TH FLOOR.

404
00:34:18.879 --> 00:34:21.053
Look, this is the worst idea, ever.

405
00:34:21.053 --> 00:34:22.877
What the fuck is this place?

406
00:34:22.878 --> 00:34:26.661
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand. Its population is 12 million people...

407
00:34:26.662 --> 00:34:31.617
Alan, will you help!

408
00:34:35.269 --> 00:34:40.180
- The elevator! - I'll get the button!

409
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:46.440
- What the fuck is the deal with this monkey? - That monkey gets it!

410
00:34:46.835 --> 00:34:48.485
- Come on! - Fuck no!

411
00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:51.572
The powers out. We gotta take the stairs.

412
00:34:51.572 --> 00:34:56.439
- Oh fuck! - Come on!

413
00:34:58.529 --> 00:35:00.789
Here it is!

414
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:05.658
Feet first. I've done this before.

415
00:35:09.615 --> 00:35:14.527
Careful!

416
00:35:31.093 --> 00:35:35.918
- Stu!  - What?

417
00:35:35.918 --> 00:35:40.743
- We still have to find Teddy! - Oh god.

418
00:35:47.874 --> 00:35:49.613
The roof!

419
00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:54.439
Teddy!

420
00:36:01.177 --> 00:36:06.045
- You guys see him? - No!

421
00:36:13.133 --> 00:36:17.088
He's not here.

422
00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:21.958
I can't believe this is happening again.

423
00:36:22.871 --> 00:36:27.088
Ok, look. We'll handle this. You get back there.

424
00:36:27.089 --> 00:36:30.739
You tell them that Alan and I got drunk with him, we're still partying.

425
00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.565
- You gotta go get married! - No! Not going back without Teddy!

426
00:36:35.959 --> 00:36:40.608
He's Lauren's little brother. He's lost, he's injured.

427
00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:45.435
If I fuck this up, I have to lose everything.

428
00:36:48.088 --> 00:36:50.609
Ok.

429
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:53.609
Alright.

430
00:36:53.609 --> 00:36:56.651
- Alan, check your pockets! - What?

431
00:36:56.652 --> 00:36:59.564
You know the drill. C'mon there might be clues.

432
00:36:59.566 --> 00:37:04.260
- Check your phones! Numbers, texts. - That's a good idea!

433
00:37:04.261 --> 00:37:07.521
- I got nothing. Fuck! - I got an text from Chow.

434
00:37:07.522 --> 00:37:10.433
- What time? - Uh, 10 o'clock last night.

435
00:37:10.434 --> 00:37:14.737
- What's it say? - "On my way, Niggahs"

436
00:37:14.738 --> 00:37:19.606
Oh, Niggahs... ok... hip hop.

437
00:37:20.434 --> 00:37:24.868
We are so... fucked!

438
00:37:24.868 --> 00:37:29.650
Hey Phil! Look who's back!

439
00:37:31.521 --> 00:37:36.301
We gotta get you out of the sun. You're too hot.

440
00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:39.866
Phil, I really think we should go to the American Consulate.

441
00:37:39.867 --> 00:37:43.388
For what? To report a dead body we shoved into an ice machine?

442
00:37:43.389 --> 00:37:46.693
What are we gonna do? Keep walking around in circles? Cause that's real productive.

443
00:37:46.694 --> 00:37:49.302
You know I'm trying to figure this thing out here and your attitude is not helping.

444
00:37:49.302 --> 00:37:52.475
I'm sorry. It's a 100 degrees and we don't have a plan.

445
00:37:52.477 --> 00:37:54.824
And all we've done is buy him hats and sodas.

446
00:37:54.824 --> 00:37:57.605
-What, it's a bag of Fanta! - Alright, what do you want to do, Stu?

447
00:37:57.605 --> 00:37:58.735
I don't know!

448
00:37:58.736 --> 00:38:00.737
Well then stop yelling at me like it's my fuckin fault.

449
00:38:00.737 --> 00:38:02.345
It is your fault!

450
00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:04.823
All I wanted was a bachelor brunch.

451
00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:06.997
Shit! Shut up! It's Doug! Talk to me!

452
00:38:06.997 --> 00:38:10.646
I just got off the phone with Bangkok PD. They've got him. He's ok.

453
00:38:10.648 --> 00:38:13.908
Oh thank god! Doug found him.

454
00:38:13.909 --> 00:38:15.734
- What happened? - He got arrested.

455
00:38:15.735 --> 00:38:18.562
- Arrested? For what? - Disorderly conduct.

456
00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:20.864
- Seriously? - Yeah! He's ok though.

457
00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:24.734
They'll release him to you. No questions asked. No one has to know.

458
00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:29.602
He's at the Ratra Wang police station.

459
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:32.603
Ok. I'll call you when we get there.

460
00:38:32.603 --> 00:38:35.212
Teddy's in jail, but he's fine. We gotta get a cab.

461
00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:40.079
- Ok! - Alright!

462
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:44.472
- Yes, I have his paperwork here. - Okay.

463
00:38:44.473 --> 00:38:48.514
- He has been treated. - Sounds good.

464
00:38:48.516 --> 00:38:52.690
We're good. They've processed him for release.

465
00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:55.254
They put him in the drunk tank. He's fine.

466
00:38:55.255 --> 00:38:59.167
Sixteen years old and spent a night in jail. Can you imagine?

467
00:38:59.168 --> 00:39:04.123
Haha! We love to party.

468
00:39:05.428 --> 00:39:08.167
Here we go!

469
00:39:08.168 --> 00:39:11.035
- Wait who's this fuckin guy? - Teddy Sisay.

470
00:39:11.035 --> 00:39:14.209
No, no, no, no. That's the wrong guy! Sir!

471
00:39:14.211 --> 00:39:18.991
Excuse me.. I'm sorry. Officer. You brought the wrong guy. That's not Teddy!

472
00:39:18.991 --> 00:39:23.078
Of course it is! We have his ID's and everything!

473
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.122
These were in his pocket when we made the arrest.

474
00:39:26.123 --> 00:39:29.122
They were in his pocket?

475
00:39:29.122 --> 00:39:33.859
Excuse me, sir! How did you get this stuff?

476
00:39:33.861 --> 00:39:35.643
Hello?

477
00:39:35.643 --> 00:39:40.469
Teddy doesn't speak. We tried English, Thai, Chinese... Nothing.

478
00:39:41.122 --> 00:39:42.990
Let me ask you something.

479
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:47.858
Does he look like he works out at Bally Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?

480
00:39:47.991 --> 00:39:52.858
Look. We arrest a lot of people. We cannot analyze everything.

481
00:39:54.469 --> 00:39:59.336
- What do you expect us to do with this guy? - Not my problem!

482
00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:04.337
Hey guys, I think he knows us. Hi. Hello.

483
00:40:08.511 --> 00:40:12.945
Do you know where our friend is, Teddy? He's missing!

484
00:40:12.945 --> 00:40:16.684
- Stu, forget it. The guys worthless. - He knows something!

485
00:40:16.686 --> 00:40:19.597
He's wearing Teddy's sweatshirt.

486
00:40:19.598 --> 00:40:24.597
Maybe he just doesn't understand. I'll act it out. Yeah, like charades. Watch.

487
00:40:25.815 --> 00:40:28.336
- Two words. - Is it a movie?

488
00:40:28.336 --> 00:40:32.247
This is not for you, Alan!

489
00:40:32.248 --> 00:40:37.074
- American teenager... in Asia. - Karate Kid, with Jaden Smith.

490
00:40:38.856 --> 00:40:41.638
It's easy cause you're talking to him.

491
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.378
Stu, it's a waste of time! Just leave this fucking guy here.

492
00:40:45.378 --> 00:40:49.378
Here's something. There are 500 thousand monks living in Thailand.

493
00:40:49.378 --> 00:40:54.332
It is not uncommon for some monks to take a vow of silence, at the age of eight.

494
00:40:55.987 --> 00:40:57.161
There you go.

495
00:40:57.161 --> 00:41:01.637
- Anything else in that envelope? - Nah, it's empty.

496
00:41:01.639 --> 00:41:06.594
Woah, hang on. A drink card from White Lion bar in Bangkok?

497
00:41:07.682 --> 00:41:11.593
Worth a shot.

498
00:41:11.595 --> 00:41:14.725
Jesus christ! Is this the right street?

499
00:41:14.725 --> 00:41:19.592
That's what it says.

500
00:41:22.942 --> 00:41:27.810
- Whoa! This is the White Lion! - What the fuck happened here?

501
00:41:28.028 --> 00:41:30.679
Holy shit!

502
00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:34.983
(yelling in Thai)

503
00:41:34.985 --> 00:41:39.809
- Let's... - We should probably...

504
00:41:42.461 --> 00:41:44.113
That's ok.

505
00:41:44.115 --> 00:41:48.808
What the fuck is going on here?

506
00:41:48.809 --> 00:41:53.635
- Whoa, guys. Check it out! - Holy shit! Stu, look!

507
00:41:54.289 --> 00:41:59.070
That's my face. Go, go go! Nice work, Alan!

508
00:42:01.984 --> 00:42:06.809
- Hello? - Be with you in a minute!

509
00:42:08.721 --> 00:42:12.199
- Excuse me. - Oh, look who it is!

510
00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:16.026
- So what do ya think? - What, I'm sorry?

511
00:42:16.026 --> 00:42:20.894
- The tattoo. You love it? - Uh, no. Actually, I hate it.

512
00:42:21.417 --> 00:42:24.373
- No refunds. Get the fuck out! - Wait a second!

513
00:42:24.373 --> 00:42:26.112
Read the sign!

514
00:42:26.112 --> 00:42:27.677
NO REFUNDS. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

515
00:42:27.678 --> 00:42:30.328
We don't want any refunds. We just have a couple of questions.

516
00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:32.460
We're trying to figure out what went down last night.

517
00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:37.328
What went down? Take a look at what you did outside. Half the neighborhood went down.

518
00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:41.242
- We did that? - You don't remember getting into a bar fight at the White Lion?

519
00:42:41.243 --> 00:42:46.110
- Starting a full on fuckin riot? - Sir, we don't remember anything.

520
00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:54.979
Oh boy...

521
00:42:55.024 --> 00:42:59.848
Check this out!

522
00:43:01.152 --> 00:43:06.021
Oh shit!

523
00:43:06.328 --> 00:43:11.239
Fuck the Police!

524
00:43:13.501 --> 00:43:18.326
There's Teddy! He was with us!

525
00:43:29.673 --> 00:43:31.238
Jesus christ!

526
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.065
That's when the cops arrived and started cracking skulls.

527
00:43:34.065 --> 00:43:37.021
I took you guys and hid you in the shop here.

528
00:43:37.021 --> 00:43:41.498
Then you decided to get a tattoo. You cried like a little bitch.

529
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.803
This kid is fucking nine years old. He's got balls twice your size.

530
00:43:44.804 --> 00:43:48.672
- Show him your balls, Nao! - No, no, no. That's ok.

531
00:43:48.674 --> 00:43:52.455
Listen, we're looking for our friend Teddy. Have you seen him?

532
00:43:52.455 --> 00:43:54.716
Not since last night. Why? What happened?

533
00:43:54.717 --> 00:43:59.585
Yeah, I'm supposed to marry his sister tomorrow and we kinda lost him.

534
00:43:59.717 --> 00:44:03.975
- Oh well. Then fuck it! - What do you mean, fuck it?

535
00:44:03.976 --> 00:44:07.715
Bangkok has him now and she'll never let him go.

536
00:44:07.716 --> 00:44:11.932
- You hear that, huh? Is this what you wanted? You happy now?

537
00:44:11.933 --> 00:44:15.497
You're wasting your time. These monks take their vow shit seriously.

538
00:44:15.498 --> 00:44:20.366
Look at this. That's the sign of the Chang Mai Monastery, just outside of town.

539
00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:25.670
Maybe somebody over there can get him to talk.

540
00:44:28.714 --> 00:44:31.583
- Ok, can we just go over this one more time? You got the beer from...

541
00:44:31.584 --> 00:44:35.669
- The hotel bar. They gave me a sealed case. - Right.

542
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:39.191
- But, who gave it to you? - The bartender.

543
00:44:39.192 --> 00:44:41.669
And then you brought em out and I  opened them.

544
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:45.146
Yeah and Doug had one and he was fine so it's not the beer.

545
00:44:45.147 --> 00:44:47.668
- So what the hell happened? - I have no idea!

546
00:44:47.669 --> 00:44:51.233
Hey guys. Check it out. He's got a Chinese boner.

547
00:44:51.234 --> 00:44:56.059
Alan, come on! Cut it out!

548
00:44:56.973 --> 00:45:01.710
- That is so wrong! - Don't stop monkey, keep doing it.

549
00:45:11.234 --> 00:45:16.190
When a monkey nibbles on a penis it's funny in any language!

550
00:45:17.625 --> 00:45:21.710
Keep doing it!

551
00:45:21.711 --> 00:45:25.059
Alright, thank you!

552
00:45:25.059 --> 00:45:29.927
Bye Shannon! Bye Little Wayne!

553
00:45:38.581 --> 00:45:43.405
Wow! So beautiful!

554
00:45:43.624 --> 00:45:47.449
What is this, a PF Chang's?

555
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:50.406
Ah, they're meditating.

556
00:45:50.406 --> 00:45:53.795
- Such a peaceful people! - Yeah.

557
00:45:53.796 --> 00:45:57.839
- Knock, knock! Hello! - Alan! Show some respect!

558
00:45:57.883 --> 00:46:02.012
- Don't get up guys. - We brought one of your guys back.

559
00:46:02.013 --> 00:46:04.925
He's really funny. He's really nice and cool.

560
00:46:04.926 --> 00:46:09.751
Hi, how you doing. You the one in charge?

561
00:46:11.144 --> 00:46:15.579
- Excuse me... ow... Wait! - Stop it! Calm down!

562
00:46:15.579 --> 00:46:20.404
Hold on. It's because we're talking.

563
00:46:20.405 --> 00:46:23.099
God damn it! Oh! Stop!

564
00:46:23.142 --> 00:46:26.186
Wait it's me!

565
00:46:26.186 --> 00:46:31.011
Oh I get it.

566
00:46:31.402 --> 00:46:36.358
No talk! No talk! Shh.. Ok...

567
00:46:40.794 --> 00:46:45.661
Ok.

568
00:47:02.445 --> 00:47:07.356
Late last night, you climbed the walls of our monastery.

569
00:47:07.445 --> 00:47:12.312
Shouting out questions about love, marriage and the meaning of life.

570
00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:18.748
Poor brother Han was meditating alone in the garden.

571
00:47:18.749 --> 00:47:23.442
- And you took him. - Oh my god!

572
00:47:23.443 --> 00:47:27.921
- We kidnapped a monk. - We live an alternative life style.

573
00:47:27.922 --> 00:47:32.790
We are so sorry about that, but we weren't ourselves last night.

574
00:47:33.313 --> 00:47:38.225
Yep, things kinda spun outta control a little bit. But there's a boy who's missing and hurt.

575
00:47:39.659 --> 00:47:42.876
Can you find out if he knows where our friend is?

576
00:47:42.877 --> 00:47:46.441
Brother Han took a vow of silence many years ago.

577
00:47:46.442 --> 00:47:48.659
It would be useless to try.

578
00:47:48.659 --> 00:47:52.875
Well maybe he can write down what happened, on a piece of paper?

579
00:47:52.876 --> 00:47:56.136
Actually Phil, that would be cheating. Isn't that right, Grand Wizard.

580
00:47:56.137 --> 00:47:59.178
- Alan! - I'm afraid fatty is right.

581
00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.224
See?... What?

582
00:48:01.225 --> 00:48:06.050
None of us will ever know what brother Han knows.

583
00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:09.571
Oh, alright. Well, so much for holy people. Bunch of bald assholes. C'mon, let's go.

584
00:48:09.572 --> 00:48:13.744
Hey you know what! FYI! You may want to put some signs up that say no talking...

585
00:48:13.745 --> 00:48:16.135
- ...before you unleash your dragon. - Yeah, that was a little rough.

586
00:48:16.136 --> 00:48:19.310
And "your welcome" for bringing him back safe.

587
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:22.266
- You know we found him in the drunk tank. - Yeah well we did take him in the first place.

588
00:48:22.267 --> 00:48:27.134
- C'mon guys, let's go. - Wait!

589
00:48:27.136 --> 00:48:32.047
The Buddha teach, every memory lives somewhere deep within.

590
00:48:33.005 --> 00:48:37.873
Perhaps you should bring your question to the Garden of Meditation.

591
00:48:37.917 --> 00:48:41.221
- Did you understand a word he just said? - Yeah, yeah. About two thirds.

592
00:48:41.222 --> 00:48:42.917
He said something about the Garden of Meditation?

593
00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:45.656
No, he said he's farting because of his medication.

594
00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:50.524
I get that.

595
00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:57.958
It's a waste of time. I don't remember anything. Do you?

596
00:48:58.221 --> 00:49:03.089
No. I got nothing. Alan?

597
00:49:05.785 --> 00:49:10.438
Alan!

598
00:49:10.439 --> 00:49:13.785
"Every memory lives somewhere deep within"

599
00:49:13.785 --> 00:49:15.610
- Sweetie. - What?

600
00:49:15.611 --> 00:49:17.175
You have visitors.

601
00:49:17.175 --> 00:49:19.000
- Hey, Alan! - Hey, guys!

602
00:49:19.002 --> 00:49:21.132
- Hey, Phil. - Hey buddy!

603
00:49:21.133 --> 00:49:23.133
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

604
00:49:23.133 --> 00:49:27.957
- Is this true, Stuart? - Yeah, why not. It'll be fun.

605
00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.350
Fuck!

606
00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:34.217
- For Lauren and Stu! - Cheers!

607
00:49:35.697 --> 00:49:40.304
- Chow! - We had a sick night bitches!

608
00:49:40.305 --> 00:49:42.913
Alan, what the fuck!

609
00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:44.955
Is that person coming to the wedding?

610
00:49:44.957 --> 00:49:48.610
- There is no wolfpack. - Alan, Alan, don't do that!

611
00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:50.348
And finally...

612
00:49:50.348 --> 00:49:55.216
The three best friends anyone could have.

613
00:50:02.565 --> 00:50:07.345
Fuck the Police!

614
00:50:17.043 --> 00:50:21.650
I know where to go.

615
00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:25.694
- What do you think, Alan? - This is the place.

616
00:50:25.694 --> 00:50:30.606
C'mon. Let's go.

617
00:50:32.172 --> 00:50:35.476
I don't remember any of this!

618
00:50:35.477 --> 00:50:40.343
- Yeah Alan, you sure this is the place? - Yeah, pretty sure.

619
00:50:47.127 --> 00:50:49.736
Rose! Harmony!

620
00:50:49.737 --> 00:50:52.127
Is he coming or what? I've been waiting all day for him.

621
00:50:52.127 --> 00:50:56.909
- I'm sorry. Waiting for who? - Chow, that dick ass fuck!

622
00:50:57.344 --> 00:51:00.430
- Why? What's wrong? - Nothings wrong.

623
00:51:00.431 --> 00:51:05.256
Ok, good. Look at this. Look what I bring for him. Check it out, huh.

624
00:51:05.301 --> 00:51:07.735
- No, no! - $ 6,000 American.

625
00:51:07.736 --> 00:51:12.603
Wow looks so real!

626
00:51:16.474 --> 00:51:18.169
Sorry!

627
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:22.908
- Alan, what the fuck! - It's ok. The gun, it's very sensitive.

628
00:51:23.822 --> 00:51:26.647
Everybody ok?

629
00:51:26.647 --> 00:51:31.559
Ok, then get the fuck back to work! Come on. Music, please!

630
00:51:32.647 --> 00:51:34.298
Where is my 6,000 dollars?

631
00:51:34.299 --> 00:51:38.081
6,000? No, no, no. This is Chow's deal. We got nothing to do with that.

632
00:51:38.081 --> 00:51:40.167
Un-fucking believable.

633
00:51:40.168 --> 00:51:43.862
This guy, if he backs out again, the shits gonna catch up with him.

634
00:51:43.864 --> 00:51:47.690
He's made a lot of enemies in this town, and now they're gonna be your enemies.

635
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:49.298
That's not fair!

636
00:51:49.298 --> 00:51:51.775
Ok listen. We're just looking for a little kid.

637
00:51:51.776 --> 00:51:53.775
- 2,000 dollars. - What!

638
00:51:53.776 --> 00:51:56.646
I don't know, maybe more. How young you want this kid to be?

639
00:51:56.646 --> 00:52:01.512
No, no! Sorry, you misunderstood. We're looking for our friend... 16 years old.

640
00:52:03.471 --> 00:52:05.558
- Teddy. - Teddy?

641
00:52:05.558 --> 00:52:07.860
- Yeah he was here with you guys last night. - He was?

642
00:52:07.862 --> 00:52:09.645
Do you know if he left with us?

643
00:52:09.645 --> 00:52:12.295
I don't know. You were in the corner all night with Kimmy.

644
00:52:12.296 --> 00:52:14.165
- I didn't see you leave. - Kimmy?

645
00:52:14.166 --> 00:52:17.469
- Is she here? - Yes, she's in the back. She just came for her shit.

646
00:52:17.471 --> 00:52:19.253
Go and talk to her.

647
00:52:19.253 --> 00:52:21.818
Alright, listen. I'm sorry about everything that happened.

648
00:52:21.818 --> 00:52:24.251
Listen to me, ok? Pay attention to what I'm going to talk to you know.

649
00:52:24.252 --> 00:52:28.338
When you see Chow, you tell him Samir says "Hello".

650
00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.208
Okay!

651
00:52:29.209 --> 00:52:34.120
But do it like that, ok! "Hello" like threatening. Like, ironic.

652
00:52:35.209 --> 00:52:40.034
- "Hellooo" - Okay!

653
00:52:44.251 --> 00:52:46.337
Go away! Go away!

654
00:52:47.469 --> 00:52:51.250
Of course I remember him. He was buying shots for everyone.

655
00:52:51.251 --> 00:52:54.946
Nice kid! His parents must be so proud.

656
00:52:54.947 --> 00:52:56.555
You have no idea.

657
00:52:56.555 --> 00:52:59.119
Ok, so do you remember if he left with us?

658
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:03.032
Yeah, you were all leaving together, but you almost forgot this one right here.

659
00:53:03.033 --> 00:53:06.205
Right, super star?

660
00:53:06.206 --> 00:53:10.684
This one was following me around like a little puppy dog. All night.

661
00:53:10.686 --> 00:53:15.554
Saying he'd fallen in love with me. Asked me to marry him.

662
00:53:15.988 --> 00:53:18.770
Classic Stu!

663
00:53:18.772 --> 00:53:21.554
- We didn't get married, did we? - Course not!

664
00:53:21.554 --> 00:53:24.163
We just had some fun in the Chardonnay room.

665
00:53:24.163 --> 00:53:27.770
- What happens in the Chardonnay room? - Let's just stay on task.

666
00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:32.725
I danced for him. He tickled me. We had sex.

667
00:53:33.336 --> 00:53:35.944
- Fuck! - It's ok. You're not married yet.

668
00:53:35.944 --> 00:53:37.856
- No big deal. - It's cheating!

669
00:53:37.857 --> 00:53:40.813
No offense to you. You're a lovely woman.

670
00:53:40.814 --> 00:53:43.118
It's a violation of my moral code.

671
00:53:43.118 --> 00:53:47.898
Don't be sad. Stu you loved it. You were crying, saying how special it was.

672
00:53:48.639 --> 00:53:52.421
- Wait! I'm sorry. He was crying? - What a baby. He was crying.

673
00:53:52.421 --> 00:53:57.289
You should have seen him. He was so sexy. The way he moved around.

674
00:53:57.291 --> 00:54:02.116
I had to ask him to slow down so I didn't drop my load too quick.

675
00:54:02.682 --> 00:54:07.290
- Load? What load? - Oh, you know... My sperms.

676
00:54:09.029 --> 00:54:13.593
I think your English is off. You're talking about my sperm!

677
00:54:13.595 --> 00:54:16.767
- Where would your sperm come from? - From my balls!

678
00:54:16.767 --> 00:54:21.635
- Hold on! Back up! - Wait... Are you...

679
00:54:21.767 --> 00:54:23.592
Hey. You're in Bangkok, sweetie.

680
00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:28.461
- There's a reason they don't call it "Bang-cunt". - Oh!

681
00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:36.332
- Oh god! - Wow.

682
00:54:37.201 --> 00:54:40.418
I don't get it. Is this a magic show?

683
00:54:40.419 --> 00:54:45.331
Come on, Stu, it was beautiful. We climaxed at the same time.

684
00:54:45.679 --> 00:54:47.330
How's that work?

685
00:54:47.331 --> 00:54:50.766
Shoot my load into you. Shoot your load on the floor.

686
00:54:50.767 --> 00:54:55.678
- Ok! - You ruined me. Ruined bottom.

687
00:54:55.982 --> 00:55:00.894
Oh god!

688
00:55:05.156 --> 00:55:10.024
- Stu! It's not the end of the world. - Sorry, but I'm so confused.

689
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:14.676
I made love to a man... with boobies.

690
00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:18.417
Listen. I promise you no ones ever gonna find out about this.

691
00:55:18.417 --> 00:55:20.198
But we found out about it.

692
00:55:20.199 --> 00:55:22.547
And then we forget. That's what we do!

693
00:55:22.547 --> 00:55:25.981
I do so much fucked up shit. And I just forget about it.

694
00:55:25.982 --> 00:55:29.677
- Yeah? - Yeah! Just forget! It goes away!

695
00:55:29.678 --> 00:55:32.894
That might be harder to go away, but in time it'll happen.

696
00:55:32.895 --> 00:55:37.850
I certainly do. Just gonna forget about it.

697
00:55:37.981 --> 00:55:41.111
- Never happened. - Great!

698
00:55:41.111 --> 00:55:43.805
Phone! Phone! Who is it? Answer!

699
00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:46.806
Lauren's dad. He just reminded me...

700
00:55:46.806 --> 00:55:48.589
- Answer it! - I can't.

701
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:51.370
What! He might know something about Teddy. C'mon we still have a shot here.

702
00:55:51.372 --> 00:55:56.284
Get your head back into the fucking game, Stu!

703
00:55:59.719 --> 00:56:00.934
Hello?

704
00:56:00.935 --> 00:56:04.370
Who takes an all day fishing trip the day before a wedding?

705
00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:09.195
- Yeah, I guess that is kinda stupid. - Put Teddy on the phone.

706
00:56:11.718 --> 00:56:14.673
- Teddy's seasick actually. - Seasick?

707
00:56:14.673 --> 00:56:19.585
- Teddy's been a Maritime cadet since he was nine. - That's weird, cause he's puking everywhere.

708
00:56:20.152 --> 00:56:23.499
I'm gonna tell you something that you do not know.

709
00:56:23.544 --> 00:56:26.804
- I don't like you. - Yeah,I knew that already.

710
00:56:26.806 --> 00:56:28.717
If my daughter chooses you, that's her problem.

711
00:56:28.717 --> 00:56:30.542
This is ??. Hey it's Phil Winnick!

712
00:56:30.543 --> 00:56:35.280
Listen, I apologize. We've been reelin in some crazy Marlin and I just wanna say...

713
00:56:35.587 --> 00:56:37.108
Phil!

714
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:38.933
- Jesus! - Phil!

715
00:56:38.934 --> 00:56:40.368
Fuck me!

716
00:56:40.369 --> 00:56:43.629
- Give us back our monkey! - What monkey? Get your own monkey!

717
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:46.846
Come on, you asshole, the fucking monkey!

718
00:56:46.847 --> 00:56:48.368
Come on!

719
00:56:48.368 --> 00:56:50.714
Anytime, Alan. He's pointing a gun at us!

720
00:56:50.714 --> 00:56:51.932
This is our monkey!

721
00:56:51.932 --> 00:56:54.192
No one's getting shot over a fucking monkey!

722
00:56:54.194 --> 00:56:56.411
Hand him over, now!

723
00:56:56.411 --> 00:56:59.323
God, I've never given him no monkeys.

724
00:56:59.324 --> 00:57:03.714
No, no ...

725
00:57:03.715 --> 00:57:07.627
Hey Phil, check it out. He's got a banana on his helmet. He's the real deal.

726
00:57:07.628 --> 00:57:08.888
What the fuck's happening?

727
00:57:08.889 --> 00:57:11.974
Hold on! How did this happen? Do you know where our friend is?

728
00:57:11.975 --> 00:57:16.843
- Yeah. Sixteen years old. Asian kid. - (says something in Russian?)

729
00:57:17.193 --> 00:57:19.410
No, I don't understand what you said! No, I didn't understand!

730
00:57:19.411 --> 00:57:21.844
What'd he say?

731
00:57:21.845 --> 00:57:26.539
He said fuck you and your questions!

732
00:57:26.539 --> 00:57:30.538
- Oh, my arm! - Philip, are you okay?

733
00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:34.539
Oh I got shot! Fuck! Fuck this!

734
00:57:34.539 --> 00:57:36.496
It's alright, Phil! It's alright!

735
00:57:36.496 --> 00:57:38.973
We'll figure this out and get the monkey back, I promise.

736
00:57:38.975 --> 00:57:43.191
Who gives a fuck about the monkey!

737
00:57:43.191 --> 00:57:48.017
- What the fuck is going on? - Stu, am I gonna be ok? You're a doctor.

738
00:57:49.192 --> 00:57:53.104
I don't know, let me look!

739
00:57:53.104 --> 00:57:55.406
What?

740
00:57:55.408 --> 00:57:56.974
Don't look at it!

741
00:57:56.974 --> 00:58:00.364
Stuart Price! Get your ass back over here!

742
00:58:00.364 --> 00:58:05.232
- You got shot! - I know!

743
00:58:18.015 --> 00:58:22.535
- Whoa, you all right? - Yeah, I'm ok.

744
00:58:22.537 --> 00:58:27.101
Actually, bullet just grazed my arm. Eight stitches.

745
00:58:27.101 --> 00:58:30.057
Only cost six dollars. How is that even possible?

746
00:58:30.058 --> 00:58:34.926
How's any of this even possible?

747
00:58:35.752 --> 00:58:40.490
If I was a foot to my left, Stu, I'd be dead.

748
00:58:41.449 --> 00:58:46.274
What are we gonna do?

749
00:58:48.535 --> 00:58:52.882
I'm sorry guys. This wasn't part of the plan.

750
00:58:52.883 --> 00:58:57.795
- What plan, Alan? - I've said too much already.

751
00:59:05.795 --> 00:59:10.360
Alan! What plan?

752
00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:13.792
- It's all Teddy's fault. - What are you talking about, Alan?

753
00:59:13.793 --> 00:59:16.227
Why is he even here? He's not part of the wolf pack!

754
00:59:16.229 --> 00:59:19.967
- Alan, what did you do? - It's not my fault!

755
00:59:19.968 --> 00:59:24.054
Teddy shouldn't have been sharing from his bag.

756
00:59:24.056 --> 00:59:26.620
- What bag? - The marshmallows.

757
00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:28.489
I had a separate bag just for Teddy.

758
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:30.228
But it was dark and it was hard to keep track.

759
00:59:30.228 --> 00:59:33.662
And then, you almost sat on em. I couldn't tell which was which.

760
00:59:33.663 --> 00:59:37.185
- It was mayhem! - What did you do to the marshmallows, Alan?

761
00:59:37.186 --> 00:59:39.967
Alan, what did you do?

762
00:59:39.967 --> 00:59:41.879
Isn't it obvious?

763
00:59:41.881 --> 00:59:46.315
I spiked them with muscle relaxers. And plus my ADHD medication.

764
00:59:46.315 --> 00:59:48.401
- What? - You drugged us again?!

765
00:59:48.401 --> 00:59:52.400
Not you! I just wanted to knock out Teddy for a little while 
so we could finally enjoy the weekend.

766
00:59:52.402 --> 00:59:57.009
Enjoy the weekend? Alan, you told me that you didn't do anything!

767
00:59:57.009 --> 00:59:58.836
Alan, you swore to god!

768
00:59:58.836 --> 01:00:00.878
I just wanted things to stay the same.

769
01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.705
Like at my face! You ruined my life!

770
01:00:05.834 --> 01:00:07.226
You're not my friend!

771
01:00:07.226 --> 01:00:09.964
Don't say that, Phil! You're serious? Even in America?

772
01:00:09.966 --> 01:00:14.051
- Yes! - Oh God! Don't say that, Phil!

773
01:00:14.052 --> 01:00:17.096
- Don't start crying, Alan! - You're the bearded devil!

774
01:00:17.096 --> 01:00:20.182
You liked it! You smiled at me when I handed you the bag with marshmallows.

775
01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:25.182
Because I like marshmallows, you fucking psycho!

776
01:00:25.226 --> 01:00:28.051
Hey! Whoa! Hold on!

777
01:00:28.052 --> 01:00:29.747
Enough!

778
01:00:29.747 --> 01:00:32.920
- Why, Alan? Why? - Stu!

779
01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.571
Because we're the three best friends, remember?

780
01:00:35.573 --> 01:00:37.355
Remember?

781
01:00:37.356 --> 01:00:42.050
Stu, that's enough...

782
01:00:43.702 --> 01:00:48.614
Guys, we can't fall apart now. We gotta stick together.

783
01:00:52.179 --> 01:00:56.526
- Alan, what's that written on your belly? - What? Huh?

784
01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:59.832
Lebua Hotel, Saturday six pm.

785
01:00:59.833 --> 01:01:03.700
- You write that? - No!

786
01:01:03.701 --> 01:01:06.440
Shit, that's in 20 minutes.

787
01:01:06.441 --> 01:01:08.397
What about England, Phil? Will we still be friends there?

788
01:01:08.397 --> 01:01:13.264
Alan, I already told you. It was in the heat of the moment. We're still friends. All over the world.

789
01:01:13.528 --> 01:01:18.352
- Even Great Britain? - Yeah.

790
01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:21.482
What about you, Stu?

791
01:01:21.484 --> 01:01:24.526
We'll see.

792
01:01:24.526 --> 01:01:29.394
Gentlemen, follow me.

793
01:01:41.177 --> 01:01:46.176
Here you go.

794
01:01:47.134 --> 01:01:49.829
Well. About time! Sit down.

795
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:52.655
Come on, sit.

796
01:01:52.656 --> 01:01:57.393
Wow, you guys look like shit.

797
01:01:57.394 --> 01:01:58.914
- Uh, do we know you? - Hey!

798
01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:03.742
Take off your fuckin hat. You're in a restaurant for christs sake. C'mon.

799
01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:10.829
Ok, listen. We have no clue what's going on here.

800
01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:15.045
You know, they sell a Plum whiskey here, it's fuckin unreal.

801
01:02:15.046 --> 01:02:19.871
Seriously, it will absolutely fuck you up! Oh, I'm sorry. You guys already got fucked up, didn't you.

802
01:02:24.045 --> 01:02:29.000
- Uh, listen, I'm a little confused. How did you... - You know what? I am a little fuckin confused!

803
01:02:29.698 --> 01:02:34.434
Where's Chow? With the fuckin account code and the fuckin password!

804
01:02:41.827 --> 01:02:46.652
We don't know anything about any codes. We're just trying to find our friend.

805
01:02:50.088 --> 01:02:54.913
- Teddy? - Yes! Teddy! Have you seen?

806
01:02:58.391 --> 01:03:01.435
Hmm, let's see...

807
01:03:01.435 --> 01:03:03.869
There's Teddy!

808
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:08.606
Holy shit! It's from last night.

809
01:03:08.607 --> 01:03:11.998
- Who are you? - I'm a businessman.

810
01:03:11.998 --> 01:03:16.475
And I've invested a large chunk of capital in your friend Chow.

811
01:03:16.477 --> 01:03:20.476
And in return, he was supposed to transfer my profits electronically.

812
01:03:20.477 --> 01:03:24.606
About five fuckin minutes ago.

813
01:03:24.607 --> 01:03:29.172
So last night, we took Teddy as insurance.

814
01:03:29.173 --> 01:03:34.040
- Oh my god! Is he okay? - Oh my god, I wasn't done talking.

815
01:03:35.433 --> 01:03:38.910
You tell Chow, that we are having breakfast on the roof of this hotel...

816
01:03:38.911 --> 01:03:42.518
...tomorrow morning at eight am.

817
01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:44.650
Or if he makes the transfer, you will get Teddy.

818
01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:49.561
If not well then hey, you know... it's Bangkok.

819
01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:55.953
That's your cue to get the fuck out of here.

820
01:03:59.909 --> 01:04:03.559
Hey, you know what? Leave the hat.

821
01:04:03.561 --> 01:04:07.038
Alan leave the hat.

822
01:04:07.038 --> 01:04:11.906
Atta boy.

823
01:04:17.822 --> 01:04:21.472
We're fucked! Chow's dead. What do we do now?

824
01:04:21.473 --> 01:04:26.384
The guy doesn't give a shit about Chow, Stu. This whole things about a fucking bank account.

825
01:04:27.387 --> 01:04:30.125
Let's just go back to the hotel. We'll search Chow's body.

826
01:04:30.125 --> 01:04:33.515
Hopefully the password's in his wallet or something.

827
01:04:33.516 --> 01:04:35.950
- And what if it isn't? - He's gonna kill Teddy.

828
01:04:35.952 --> 01:04:40.862
Just relax. We have until 8am tomorrow to figure it out.

829
01:04:43.037 --> 01:04:47.949
First the monkey and now my hat. How much worse can this day get.

830
01:04:52.124 --> 01:04:57.035
Jesus christ!

831
01:05:01.383 --> 01:05:11.251
Well we're livin here in Alan town. And he's drivin our lives into the ground.

832
01:05:12.643 --> 01:05:17.078
When we woke up we were wasted and drunk.

833
01:05:17.078 --> 01:05:21.946
Phil got shot. We got beaten by a monk.

834
01:05:25.078 --> 01:05:29.946
I was happy, and my life was good.

835
01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:34.947
Getting married like a dentist should.

836
01:05:34.947 --> 01:05:38.815
Roasting marshmallows on a stick.

837
01:05:38.817 --> 01:05:43.685
I got fucked in the ass... by a girl with a dick.

838
01:05:46.381 --> 01:05:50.684
Oh yeah, I will remember that.

839
01:05:50.685 --> 01:05:55.597
And we're livin in Alan town.

840
01:05:57.425 --> 01:05:59.684
There's water everywhere.

841
01:05:59.685 --> 01:06:02.685
Yeah it's cause it melted, Stu. The fuckin powers out.

842
01:06:02.685 --> 01:06:05.640
With an inadequate electrical grid, serving millions of people

843
01:06:05.641 --> 01:06:09.075
Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages per year.

844
01:06:09.076 --> 01:06:11.205
Seriously, Alan. That's enough!

845
01:06:11.205 --> 01:06:16.031
Out of the way!

846
01:06:19.163 --> 01:06:23.944
We got it.

847
01:06:25.161 --> 01:06:29.247
Oh my god!

848
01:06:29.248 --> 01:06:32.204
Chow, calm down!

849
01:06:32.249 --> 01:06:37.074
- You put the chill on me? - No, no!

850
01:06:37.943 --> 01:06:40.029
It's okay.

851
01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:44.812
Relax!

852
01:06:50.247 --> 01:06:54.551
It's just us. Breathe!

853
01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:55.812
It was so cold.

854
01:06:55.813 --> 01:06:59.245
- We're gonna warm you up. - I was so cold!

855
01:06:59.247 --> 01:07:04.115
- You did good, buddy. You did good. - I did good.

856
01:07:08.594 --> 01:07:11.072
Feelin better?

857
01:07:11.116 --> 01:07:13.941
- Alright, you warm enough? - I don't know.

858
01:07:13.941 --> 01:07:15.897
Come feel my bowels and tell me.

859
01:07:15.897 --> 01:07:19.332
I've been locked in a fuckin ice box all day!

860
01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:22.070
Hey Alan, if you want my sunglasses...

861
01:07:22.115 --> 01:07:25.244
...just ask Chow. You don't have to kill me.

862
01:07:25.245 --> 01:07:29.418
Chow, nobody killed you. You were already dead. You didn't have a pulse.

863
01:07:29.419 --> 01:07:31.419
Oh, you never do blow before?

864
01:07:31.419 --> 01:07:34.114
Sometimes your heart stop... start up again.

865
01:07:34.115 --> 01:07:37.460
- Read a book! - Look I'm sorry. We're having a bad day.

866
01:07:37.461 --> 01:07:41.723
Oh, you're having a bad day! Did you die?

867
01:07:41.723 --> 01:07:44.722
- I got shot! - But did you die?

868
01:07:44.723 --> 01:07:48.200
Chow, some guy told us that you got a bank code or something...

869
01:07:48.201 --> 01:07:51.678
...and if we don't bring it to him first think in the morning...

870
01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.157
...he's gonna kill Teddy.

871
01:07:53.157 --> 01:07:57.982
Who, Kingsley? He harmless. Don't worry. I got the bank codes.

872
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:05.373
Great! Alright, we gotta meet him at 8am. -Who is that fuckin guy, anyway?

873
01:08:05.722 --> 01:08:09.284
- An investor in my business. - Yeah, what business is that?

874
01:08:09.284 --> 01:08:12.588
It's called "not your business" ok!

875
01:08:12.590 --> 01:08:15.981
- Oh, where's the monkey? - The monkey...

876
01:08:15.981 --> 01:08:20.893
Yeah I put the account number and password in his vest. Where is he?

877
01:08:22.851 --> 01:08:26.459
- Why would you do that? - Safe keeping, pretty boy.

878
01:08:26.459 --> 01:08:31.327
I got a lotta heat on my ass. I got FBI, Bangkok PD, Interpol, MSNBC...

879
01:08:34.458 --> 01:08:36.501
That little monkey snorting coke with me all night...

880
01:08:36.503 --> 01:08:39.763
Jerkin me off while I watched Stu make fuckin lady boy.

881
01:08:39.764 --> 01:08:43.849
- He not going anywhere. - We don't have the monkey, Chow.

882
01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:46.805
Oh, some Russian thugs took him from us.

883
01:08:46.806 --> 01:08:49.718
Oh you fucking guys!

884
01:08:49.719 --> 01:08:53.630
Okay. No problem. We just have to get him back.

885
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:58.542
- From where? - From the same place we took him from.

886
01:09:18.456 --> 01:09:23.455
This monkey isn't just normal monkey.

887
01:09:33.889 --> 01:09:38.062
Every night, monkey drug mule.

888
01:09:38.063 --> 01:09:42.931
He take coke to buyer...

889
01:09:43.455 --> 01:09:47.931
And deliver cash to dealer. He is middle man.

890
01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:50.846
Dealer never handle drug directly.

891
01:09:50.847 --> 01:09:54.192
He clean.

892
01:09:54.192 --> 01:09:58.931
- That's terrible. - Not terrible. What he talking about. Fucking genius.

893
01:09:58.933 --> 01:10:02.758
You ever see monkey go to jail?

894
01:10:02.758 --> 01:10:07.714
We just take the monkey for deal, he come
close, we take his vest. That's that.

895
01:10:07.932 --> 01:10:12.800
- We get some blow too, you know... bump. - No, no more bumps, Chow.

896
01:10:14.498 --> 01:10:18.844
This is ridiculous.

897
01:10:18.844 --> 01:10:23.668
Stu, Mr. Chow can't whistle. Shake your monkey.

898
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:34.843
Alright, here we go.

899
01:10:34.843 --> 01:10:39.711
Come on!

900
01:10:41.408 --> 01:10:43.712
How did we wind up with the monkey last night anyway?

901
01:10:43.713 --> 01:10:46.060
I needed some blow and Alan thought he was cute...

902
01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:50.972
...so we stole him!

903
01:10:59.625 --> 01:11:01.102
So stupid!

904
01:11:01.103 --> 01:11:02.798
Stu, ready to grab vest?

905
01:11:02.798 --> 01:11:07.536
- Okay. I just grab it? - Yeah, just do it. Just do it.

906
01:11:07.538 --> 01:11:12.405
- Hey, little monkey. - Alan, be quiet.

907
01:11:13.668 --> 01:11:17.362
- Fuck! - We gotta go, right now!

908
01:11:17.363 --> 01:11:22.231
- Pull that fuckin monkey in! - I'm trying!

909
01:11:25.275 --> 01:11:30.100
Shit!

910
01:11:30.101 --> 01:11:34.359
- Get that monkey in here, Stu! - He won't let go!

911
01:11:34.361 --> 01:11:37.144
Stu, get back in the car! Right now!

912
01:11:37.145 --> 01:11:42.013
I'm trying! Slow down!

913
01:11:45.666 --> 01:11:50.447
He's so strong!

914
01:11:50.751 --> 01:11:53.795
Let go you fuckin monkey!

915
01:11:53.796 --> 01:11:58.663
- Look out! - Oh shit! Tight squeeze!

916
01:11:59.707 --> 01:12:04.445
I got him!

917
01:12:04.447 --> 01:12:09.446
- Where's the code, Chow? - Check his little vest.

918
01:12:11.534 --> 01:12:13.794
- Got it, Alan? - Yes, I got a .

919
01:12:13.794 --> 01:12:18.705
- Slow down Chow! - Hold on, J-Birds.

920
01:12:20.924 --> 01:12:23.923
Holy Shit!

921
01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:28.140
Don't worry. I got this shit!

922
01:12:28.142 --> 01:12:32.967
Pig!

923
01:12:33.923 --> 01:12:35.488
Oh, my word.

924
01:12:35.488 --> 01:12:40.313
Sorry, Stu! My bad!

925
01:12:42.836 --> 01:12:45.226
Oh, shit!

926
01:12:45.226 --> 01:12:46.704
Get down!

927
01:12:46.706 --> 01:12:49.314
What the fuck!

928
01:12:49.314 --> 01:12:52.314
Oh no! He shot the monkey!

929
01:12:52.314 --> 01:12:55.052
They shot the monkey.

930
01:12:55.054 --> 01:12:59.879
I'm at my wits end.

931
01:12:59.879 --> 01:13:02.225
He's coming back around.

932
01:13:02.225 --> 01:13:07.137
Look out!

933
01:13:07.356 --> 01:13:12.181
- Holy fuck! - Oh no...

934
01:13:29.529 --> 01:13:32.789
- Everyone alright? - Yeah.

935
01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:37.615
I have such an erection right now!

936
01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:44.658
Are you for real?

937
01:13:56.049 --> 01:14:00.874
They're gonna take good care of you here, ok ?

938
01:14:00.919 --> 01:14:04.918
What's that?

939
01:14:04.918 --> 01:14:09.743
Oh, yeah. Cigarettes. Got em right here. Here you go.

940
01:14:14.048 --> 01:14:18.395
Right here.

941
01:14:18.397 --> 01:14:22.830
Deep breathe. Good.

942
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:25.481
Soak it in.

943
01:14:25.483 --> 01:14:30.048
Breathe the smoke into your tiny little lungs. There you go.

944
01:14:30.048 --> 01:14:34.003
It's funny. I've never been much of a smoker, but...

945
01:14:34.005 --> 01:14:36.352
Boy does it look cool on you.

946
01:14:36.352 --> 01:14:41.176
Alan, c'mon! Let's go!

947
01:14:42.134 --> 01:14:46.915
I'll miss you, monkey.

948
01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:50.915
I wish monkeys could Skype.

949
01:14:50.916 --> 01:14:55.915
Maybe one day...

950
01:15:00.438 --> 01:15:05.174
Come on! Get in!

951
01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:41.303
Are you guys seriously this calm?

952
01:15:41.304 --> 01:15:43.913
Relax, Stuart. It's classic switcheroo.

953
01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:46.173
I give him money, he gives us Teddy.

954
01:15:46.174 --> 01:15:48.869
You ever do anything that doesn't end up in a standoff, Chow?

955
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:52.129
I'm an international criminal. It always ends like this.

956
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:54.956
I met my wife at one of these things.

957
01:15:54.957 --> 01:15:59.216
- You got a wife? - Yeah, we married 15 years.

958
01:15:59.217 --> 01:16:02.954
What, I not good looking enough for woman?

959
01:16:02.955 --> 01:16:06.346
No, that's cool.

960
01:16:06.346 --> 01:16:07.432
Let's do this!

961
01:16:07.433 --> 01:16:11.953
- Welcome to the Tower Club. - Blah blah blah, who cares.

962
01:16:11.955 --> 01:16:16.867
Stop! Chow crossing.

963
01:16:17.911 --> 01:16:21.301
- Hey, Kingsley! - Well, well.

964
01:16:21.302 --> 01:16:23.344
Propecia looking nice!

965
01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:25.519
You been hitting the gym?

966
01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:29.040
Yes I am actually. Thank you for noticing, Chow.

967
01:16:29.041 --> 01:16:31.692
Hey, guys. Have a seat.

968
01:16:31.693 --> 01:16:35.257
- Where's Teddy? - He's waiting downstairs in my car.

969
01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:37.475
Send him up when the transfer is complete.

970
01:16:37.476 --> 01:16:40.387
Tell you what. Give me extra 50 grand, you keep Teddy.

971
01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:45.299
And I throw in this other fat fuck for free.

972
01:16:45.344 --> 01:16:48.344
- Chow.. Chow... - Could we move this along!

973
01:16:48.345 --> 01:16:53.082
Alan, account number. Come on, come on.

974
01:16:53.082 --> 01:17:03.994
8-1-4, K as in knife, 2-3-9-8.
8-1-4, K, 2-3-9-8.

975
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:07.907
- Password? - "baloney1"

976
01:17:07.908 --> 01:17:09.473
Your password is "baloney1" ?

977
01:17:09.473 --> 01:17:12.515
Well it used to be just "baloney" but now they make you add number.

978
01:17:12.516 --> 01:17:17.428
Fuckin annoying.

979
01:17:25.777 --> 01:17:28.733
- And it's that easy. - Ta dah!

980
01:17:28.733 --> 01:17:32.382
Oh look. You sunk my battleship.

981
01:17:32.384 --> 01:17:37.211
- Great, now can we please have Teddy? - Yeah. Bring him up.

982
01:17:40.515 --> 01:17:44.036
See. We go to your wedding. We have fun. I bust a nut.

983
01:17:44.037 --> 01:17:48.904
We did it, Stu. It's over!

984
01:17:55.688 --> 01:18:00.513
This is Bangkok police! Everybody down!

985
01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:02.687
Oh, nuts!

986
01:18:02.688 --> 01:18:05.121
Kingsley, you're fucking Five-O?

987
01:18:05.121 --> 01:18:06.642
Gotcha, Leslie!

988
01:18:06.644 --> 01:18:07.774
Get him outta here.

989
01:18:07.774 --> 01:18:12.729
Go! Just do it! Go!

990
01:18:14.427 --> 01:18:16.512
How the fuck...

991
01:18:16.513 --> 01:18:21.555
Samir, you fucked me over six grand? You camel jockey!

992
01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.816
You spit on me?

993
01:18:26.817 --> 01:18:31.425
Six grand this time, eight grand last time. It's not the money, man, it's the principle!

994
01:18:31.426 --> 01:18:34.511
Principle? Nigga, please! We both dead inside.

995
01:18:34.512 --> 01:18:36.945
Call me nigga... don't call me "nigga"!

996
01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:41.294
- Put em in, motherfucker! - He's an asshole, man.

997
01:18:41.295 --> 01:18:42.728
You guys ok?

998
01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:46.164
- What the fucks going on? - Detective Inspector Peters, Interpol.

999
01:18:46.164 --> 01:18:47.511
- You're a cop? - Yes.

1000
01:18:47.511 --> 01:18:50.293
This sting operation has been in place for weeks.

1001
01:18:50.293 --> 01:18:53.031
When Samir told us that your friend was lost...

1002
01:18:53.033 --> 01:18:57.814
We took advantage of that information. I'm sorry.

1003
01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.248
- So can Teddy come out of the car now? - No, Alan, Teddy's not in the fuckin car!

1004
01:19:03.249 --> 01:19:05.640
They don't have him. They never had him.

1005
01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:10.334
They just needed us to bring them Chow. They used Teddy as bait.

1006
01:19:11.075 --> 01:19:14.205
- Do you have any leads at all? - No. We've checked everywhere.

1007
01:19:14.205 --> 01:19:17.247
No one has seen him. I'm sorry.

1008
01:19:17.248 --> 01:19:22.116
If you haven't found him by now, I'm afraid Bangkok has him.

1009
01:19:26.901 --> 01:19:31.769
Why do people keep saying that?

1010
01:19:31.857 --> 01:19:36.682
Stu... It's time.

1011
01:19:40.856 --> 01:19:43.290
Phill...

1012
01:19:43.291 --> 01:19:47.897
-I'm sorry. - Don't say that. Please.

1013
01:19:47.899 --> 01:19:52.203
- No this time we really fucked up. - Oh god! How bad?

1014
01:19:52.203 --> 01:19:56.246
Like, no wedding bad?

1015
01:19:56.247 --> 01:20:01.115
Yeah... a little worse than that!

1016
01:20:24.636 --> 01:20:29.504
Ok, how about this? He fell off the fishing boat and drowned.

1017
01:20:29.984 --> 01:20:32.723
No.

1018
01:20:32.723 --> 01:20:36.722
Ok, I got it. Teddy was hit by a truck.

1019
01:20:36.722 --> 01:20:39.938
- Alan! - Not a good time, Phil. Kinda busy!

1020
01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.853
How many people get run over here?

1021
01:20:41.853 --> 01:20:45.678
- Over 1200 a year, Phil. - Perfect!

1022
01:20:45.678 --> 01:20:50.372
His body was too mangled to recover. Case closed.

1023
01:20:50.374 --> 01:20:53.200
Can I get more ice, please?

1024
01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.938
I'm not gonna lie to Lauren.

1025
01:20:54.938 --> 01:21:04.806
- Stu, do you want this or not? - Look at what I've done, Phil. What I do.

1026
01:21:05.765 --> 01:21:10.589
I have a weakness for prostitutes. All kinds, apparently.

1027
01:21:14.808 --> 01:21:19.675
- I have a demon in me! - So what?

1028
01:21:21.067 --> 01:21:24.284
Teddy's gone, but I can still save Lauren.

1029
01:21:24.285 --> 01:21:26.241
Just let her live her life without me.

1030
01:21:26.242 --> 01:21:27.675
Stu!

1031
01:21:27.676 --> 01:21:31.458
I want you to call Doug and tell him I'm never coming back.

1032
01:21:31.459 --> 01:21:35.023
Gettin off the hamster wheel.

1033
01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:39.631
Gonna stay here in Bangkok. I think I belong here.

1034
01:21:39.675 --> 01:21:43.239
Open up a little dentists office.

1035
01:21:43.241 --> 01:21:48.196
Deep cleanings, with a happy ending.

1036
01:21:49.587 --> 01:21:54.414
You sure about this?

1037
01:21:58.631 --> 01:22:02.586
Hey, what the crud!

1038
01:22:02.586 --> 01:22:07.454
Powers out, Alan.

1039
01:22:08.413 --> 01:22:09.673
- Phil! - Doug.

1040
01:22:09.718 --> 01:22:13.109
- I need answers, man. - I know...

1041
01:22:13.109 --> 01:22:14.194
Doug, who are you talking to?

1042
01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:15.195
- What? - Give me the phone!

1043
01:22:15.195 --> 01:22:16.410
Lauren, no! That's a private...

1044
01:22:16.412 --> 01:22:17.586
Who is this?

1045
01:22:17.586 --> 01:22:21.760
- Lauren? - Phil? Tell me what's going on, right now!

1046
01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.758
We lost your little brother.

1047
01:22:23.759 --> 01:22:28.715
- What? - Bangkok has him now.

1048
01:22:34.630 --> 01:22:36.585
You gotta take the stairs.

1049
01:22:36.585 --> 01:22:41.323
You're in Bangkok?

1050
01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:45.454
Ooh, that's a finger!

1051
01:22:45.454 --> 01:22:47.627
Put Stu on the phone!

1052
01:22:47.628 --> 01:22:51.367
Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages per year.

1053
01:22:51.368 --> 01:22:54.279
Stu really doesn't want to talk to anybody.

1054
01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.801
- Water everywhere. Powers out.

1055
01:22:55.801 --> 01:23:00.626
Come on, Stu, use that big Jewish brain

1056
01:23:00.932 --> 01:23:03.888
Phil! Give me the phone!

1057
01:23:03.888 --> 01:23:05.844
- It's Lauren! I got it! I'm handling it! - I know.!

1058
01:23:05.845 --> 01:23:07.757
- Give me the fuckin... - I can handle it, Stu!

1059
01:23:07.757 --> 01:23:09.321
She's gonna break your heart!

1060
01:23:09.322 --> 01:23:12.017
Honey, sweetheart, it's me! I'm so sorry!

1061
01:23:12.018 --> 01:23:15.843
Stu? What the hell is going on? What does he mean you lost Teddy?

1062
01:23:15.843 --> 01:23:20.755
What? Is that what Phil said? No no no. We misplaced, Teddy.

1063
01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:25.016
But we're all good now. We heading back to the hotel. We're gonna see you soon!

1064
01:23:25.017 --> 01:23:29.885
I love you so much! And I gotta go, but I'll see you soon. Bye.

1065
01:23:33.147 --> 01:23:37.668
Stu!

1066
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:40.625
- Stu! - God!

1067
01:23:40.626 --> 01:23:43.408
Taxi!

1068
01:23:43.408 --> 01:23:48.189
Come on, Alan!

1069
01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:49.972
Hey, you mind filling us in!

1070
01:23:49.973 --> 01:23:52.623
Ok, now when we woke up, the power was out.

1071
01:23:52.623 --> 01:23:55.144
And you found Teddy's finger in what?

1072
01:23:55.146 --> 01:23:58.363
- In a pool of water. - But it didn't start out as water.

1073
01:23:58.363 --> 01:24:00.102
No, it was ice.

1074
01:24:00.103 --> 01:24:01.797
Exactly! Teddy got ice from the machine...

1075
01:24:01.797 --> 01:24:04.449
...came back to the room. Put his finger on ice and fell asleep.

1076
01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:05.492
Now what do you do if you wake up...

1077
01:24:05.493 --> 01:24:08.362
...and you find your finger floating in a bowl of melted ice?

1078
01:24:08.363 --> 01:24:11.884
I'd get more ice, Stu... on the 15th fuckin floor!

1079
01:24:11.885 --> 01:24:15.058
Yes! Teddy goes up, the power goes out...

1080
01:24:15.059 --> 01:24:19.927
- Holy shit! Of course! - He's at the ice machine.

1081
01:24:20.885 --> 01:24:25.795
Alan, no!

1082
01:24:25.971 --> 01:24:27.579
It's on ten!

1083
01:24:27.579 --> 01:24:30.405
- Sir, is the elevator stuck? - ??.

1084
01:24:30.406 --> 01:24:35.361
- C'mon! - Go, go, go!

1085
01:24:36.144 --> 01:24:38.576
Hey, Teddy!

1086
01:24:38.578 --> 01:24:43.446
Look out, look out!

1087
01:24:49.404 --> 01:24:52.751
- Teddy! - You're ok!

1088
01:24:52.751 --> 01:24:55.837
Teddy, you okay? You ok, man?

1089
01:24:55.838 --> 01:24:59.098
- Where am I? - You're in an elevator, in the middle of Bangkok.

1090
01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.446
But we're gonna get you outta here. It's gonna be fine.

1091
01:25:01.446 --> 01:25:06.358
Hey Stu, nice tattoo.

1092
01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:08.315
Thanks, man.

1093
01:25:08.315 --> 01:25:10.663
Alright, let's do this! C'mon, c'mon!

1094
01:25:10.664 --> 01:25:15.619
Tell him we found him. Yeah, I know. But we're on our way. Ok, bye!

1095
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:22.576
Alright, guests are arriving, people starting to ask questions, but we can still pull this off!

1096
01:25:23.142 --> 01:25:25.968
- How? - I don't know, with a taxi?

1097
01:25:25.968 --> 01:25:27.576
- Chow's speed boat. - What?

1098
01:25:27.576 --> 01:25:29.967
Last think I remember, was getting off Chow's speed boat.

1099
01:25:29.968 --> 01:25:34.575
- Chow has a speed boat? - "The Perfect Life".

1100
01:25:34.576 --> 01:25:39.487
C'mon!

1101
01:25:39.878 --> 01:25:43.573
Stu, get that back line.

1102
01:25:43.575 --> 01:25:47.443
Good jump, Phil!

1103
01:25:47.444 --> 01:25:49.747
- You alright? - Yeah.

1104
01:25:49.749 --> 01:25:52.749
- You sure you know how to drive this thing?

1105
01:25:52.749 --> 01:25:57.704
Please, I was raised in a yacht club. I know what I'm doing.

1106
01:26:19.095 --> 01:26:21.572
You know where we're going?

1107
01:26:21.572 --> 01:26:23.528
Leave it to the Captain!

1108
01:26:23.529 --> 01:26:26.964
Oh fuck you, Alan!

1109
01:26:26.965 --> 01:26:30.790
Do you know where we're going, Captain?

1110
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:33.528
Affirmative cadet! We're going south.

1111
01:26:33.528 --> 01:26:38.482
- We're in the Gulf of Thailand. - Good.

1112
01:26:59.048 --> 01:27:02.656
Hey! You okay?

1113
01:27:02.657 --> 01:27:06.525
- Feeling a little better. - Alright!

1114
01:27:06.526 --> 01:27:11.351
Listen Teddy. I'm really sorry! We didn't mean for any of this to happen.

1115
01:27:11.745 --> 01:27:20.613
It's funny. I can't remember anything but... when I woke up, I was kinda happy.

1116
01:27:22.134 --> 01:27:25.046
Yeah!

1117
01:27:25.047 --> 01:27:28.830
By the way... Do you have any idea where my finger is?

1118
01:27:28.831 --> 01:27:33.568
Yeah, we gave it to a drug dealing monkey.

1119
01:27:34.742 --> 01:27:36.742
Bangkok...

1120
01:27:36.743 --> 01:27:41.568
Yeah, right... fuckin Bangkok!

1121
01:27:54.438 --> 01:27:56.568
I apologize. There will be no wedding!

1122
01:27:56.568 --> 01:27:58.697
He is on his way. He will be here...

1123
01:27:58.698 --> 01:28:03.480
Please, if you will all move to the bar. We are going to clear this area.

1124
01:28:03.481 --> 01:28:07.915
Please!

1125
01:28:07.915 --> 01:28:12.696
I'm telling you, I spoke to him. He's coming.

1126
01:28:14.437 --> 01:28:19.304
Look! There they are!

1127
01:28:20.697 --> 01:28:25.607
Stu!

1128
01:28:28.174 --> 01:28:31.042
- Alan, there's no dock. - Just hang on!

1129
01:28:31.044 --> 01:28:33.913
- Alan, it's not funny! Turn the boat! - Hang on!

1130
01:28:33.914 --> 01:28:36.781
- Is that Alan driving the boat? - What?

1131
01:28:36.781 --> 01:28:40.824
Uh, we should probably move back a little bit.

1132
01:28:40.825 --> 01:28:43.085
Oh my god!

1133
01:28:43.086 --> 01:28:45.304
Turn the boat!

1134
01:28:45.304 --> 01:28:46.824
Everyone back up a little bit here.

1135
01:28:46.825 --> 01:28:51.693
Sir, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.

1136
01:29:06.128 --> 01:29:10.736
Hi! Hi everybody!

1137
01:29:10.737 --> 01:29:15.649
Came in a little hotter than we planned. I'm sorry we trenched the lawn here.

1138
01:29:16.216 --> 01:29:18.563
Totally fixable. A little bit of sod, it'll be fine.

1139
01:29:18.563 --> 01:29:20.605
- Baby! - Oh my god!

1140
01:29:20.606 --> 01:29:24.127
I'm so happy to see you!

1141
01:29:24.129 --> 01:29:28.953
- Teddy! Teddy here. - Hi, Dad!

1142
01:29:29.302 --> 01:29:33.083
- You alright? - Yeah, ok.

1143
01:29:33.084 --> 01:29:35.952
- Your hand! - I know.

1144
01:29:35.953 --> 01:29:40.212
We had an accident. I'm ok.

1145
01:29:40.213 --> 01:29:41.473
This is your fault!

1146
01:29:41.475 --> 01:29:46.387
- Dad. - He's right. I have not been completely honest.

1147
01:29:46.517 --> 01:29:48.081
- Stu? Don't do this. -Yeah?

1148
01:29:48.081 --> 01:29:50.908
Thanks, Phil, but gonna do it.

1149
01:29:50.909 --> 01:29:55.777
You said I'm a joke.Well I'm not.

1150
01:29:55.952 --> 01:30:00.776
I'm not some weird, milky, ricy, watery that you feed to infants and old people, ok!

1151
01:30:03.691 --> 01:30:08.559
Maybe I would be if you added some cayenne pepper!

1152
01:30:10.256 --> 01:30:12.081
I wish I was a boring dentist...

1153
01:30:12.082 --> 01:30:14.341
...who had a boring life and boring friends...

1154
01:30:14.341 --> 01:30:16.906
... but I don't and I'm not.

1155
01:30:16.908 --> 01:30:19.429
I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.

1156
01:30:19.429 --> 01:30:22.950
It's not weird. It's pretty cool actually. No membership fees.

1157
01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:25.688
I've had enough of this. Come here.

1158
01:30:25.689 --> 01:30:30.080
Whoa! Here's the deal man.

1159
01:30:30.081 --> 01:30:33.949
- I got a dark side!

1160
01:30:33.949 --> 01:30:36.818
There's a demon in me!

1161
01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:39.601
It's true, he has semen in him.

1162
01:30:39.602 --> 01:30:41.385
I said demon.

1163
01:30:41.385 --> 01:30:46.339
- But you also have semen in you, remember? - Not relevant, but thank you, Alan.

1164
01:30:48.123 --> 01:30:53.035
The point is, this demon takes me to some pretty weird places.

1165
01:30:53.991 --> 01:30:57.861
We lost Teddy for two days in Bangkok.

1166
01:30:57.862 --> 01:31:01.947
But that same demon took us to hell and back to find him.

1167
01:31:01.949 --> 01:31:04.643
We took on Bangkok and we won.

1168
01:31:04.644 --> 01:31:09.469
Now that's pretty fuckin cool if you ask me!

1169
01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:16.642
I love your daughter, and I'm gonna marry her.

1170
01:31:16.643 --> 01:31:20.817
- Unless you have any problem with that? - I'm good.

1171
01:31:20.818 --> 01:31:25.685
But all that said, it would actually mean a great deal to both of us...

1172
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:30.945
...if we could just get your mother fucking blessing!

1173
01:31:46.207 --> 01:31:48.901
Hey, Alan...

1174
01:31:48.902 --> 01:31:53.509
- That looks pretty cool shaved. - Thanks, Phil.

1175
01:31:53.509 --> 01:31:55.466
You should shave your head too.

1176
01:31:55.468 --> 01:32:00.293
- Why would I do that? - Well than we would look exactly alike.

1177
01:32:10.770 --> 01:32:15.682
- Take good care of my daughter, Stu. - I will.

1178
01:32:22.597 --> 01:32:25.204
I'm sorry we almost killed everyone with the boat.

1179
01:32:25.204 --> 01:32:29.856
Just happy you're here.

1180
01:32:29.856 --> 01:32:33.724
And don't worry about the tattoo. I'm gonna have it lasered as soon as we're home in LA.

1181
01:32:33.726 --> 01:32:38.508
- That's ok. I can get used to it. - Really?

1182
01:32:40.943 --> 01:32:43.247
But for now, let's switch sides?

1183
01:32:43.248 --> 01:32:46.855
- Yeah, ok. - Thank you.

1184
01:32:46.855 --> 01:32:49.637
Much better.

1185
01:32:49.638 --> 01:32:53.681
Dear family and friends. On behalf of Stu and Lauren...

1186
01:32:53.681 --> 01:32:58.420
...I welcome all of you, to this marriage celebration.

1187
01:32:58.422 --> 01:33:03.288
We are here today to...

1188
01:33:56.764 --> 01:33:59.632
Hey buddy. Can you hold on for a second.

1189
01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:04.417
Thank you.

1190
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:12.675
Hello? Hi everyone!

1191
01:34:12.676 --> 01:34:15.327
My name's Alan Garner.

1192
01:34:15.328 --> 01:34:20.240
I want to thank the Asiatic people for allowing us in your land.

1193
01:34:23.111 --> 01:34:27.587
I wanted to say that, um, I'm really happy to be here...

1194
01:34:27.589 --> 01:34:32.415
...and I have a wedding gift to present to Lauren and Stu.

1195
01:34:32.763 --> 01:34:35.674
And um, a lot of thought has gone into this...

1196
01:34:35.675 --> 01:34:40.543
...and I hope that you appreciate it as much as I did, or going to.

1197
01:34:40.544 --> 01:34:45.412
Okay, guys!

1198
01:34:59.804 --> 01:35:04.672
Oh, fuck!

1199
01:35:22.802 --> 01:35:26.062
Alan!

1200
01:35:26.063 --> 01:35:28.323
What the fuck?

1201
01:35:28.324 --> 01:35:31.714
- So what do ya think? - That's insane! How did you do that?

1202
01:35:31.715 --> 01:35:33.498
My dad had to make a lot of calls.

1203
01:35:33.498 --> 01:35:37.757
I told Mike that you gotta do it. It's for my third best friend.

1204
01:35:37.759 --> 01:35:41.976
Alan, it's amazing! I love it! Thank you so much!

1205
01:35:41.977 --> 01:35:46.106
We only have him for tonight. We don't have him permanently.

1206
01:35:46.106 --> 01:35:50.843
Understood!

1207
01:36:03.452 --> 01:36:07.625
- You do a lot of public speaking, Alan? - I barely ??

1208
01:36:07.627 --> 01:36:12.539
Mike, you were great. It's true, that was incredible.

1209
01:36:12.626 --> 01:36:15.711
Thanks, guys. That means a lot, really!

1210
01:36:15.713 --> 01:36:19.538
By the way, you really need to remove that fuckin tattoo from your face!

1211
01:36:19.538 --> 01:36:23.755
Yeah! On it!

1212
01:36:23.756 --> 01:36:26.147
Sorry about the last minute change up to the performance, Mike.

1213
01:36:26.147 --> 01:36:28.016
- Don't worry, Alan. - What are you talking about?

1214
01:36:28.017 --> 01:36:30.799
Well he was originally supposed to sing "Burning Up" by the Jonas Brothers...

1215
01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:33.755
...but then I remembered you don't like indie rock.

1216
01:36:33.756 --> 01:36:36.277
Hey guys. You're not gonna believe this.

1217
01:36:36.277 --> 01:36:38.754
- Is that your phone? - Yeah.

1218
01:36:38.755 --> 01:36:40.797
How come you never tried calling us?

1219
01:36:40.799 --> 01:36:42.667
It's been dead for two days.

1220
01:36:42.668 --> 01:36:45.146
But I recharged it and found all these photos.

1221
01:36:45.146 --> 01:36:46.536
What?

1222
01:36:46.536 --> 01:36:48.667
- Shit! - Yeah, some of it's pretty messed up.

1223
01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:51.710
- Awesome, let's check em out. - Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1224
01:36:51.711 --> 01:36:53.406
No one needs to see this stuff!

1225
01:36:53.407 --> 01:36:56.406
C'mon man! I'm Mike Tyson. I've seen everything!

1226
01:36:56.406 --> 01:37:00.101
- It'll be fine. - (mumbles something)

1227
01:37:00.103 --> 01:37:04.797
- Alright, we look at it once. - And then we delete them. It's gonna be ok.

1228
01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:11.231
- Oh, ooh! - Mother fucker!

1229
01:37:07.231 --> 01:37:20.000


1230
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:20.000
