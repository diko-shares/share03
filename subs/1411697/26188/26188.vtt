1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,974
A civilian died on your watch.

2
00:00:00,976 --> 00:00:02,642
I reported what I reported.

3
00:00:02,644 --> 00:00:03,710
And that's that.

4
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:04,978
I'm gonna need your badge
and your gun.

5
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,246
Alex, are you okay?

6
00:00:06,248 --> 00:00:08,014
My name is don.

7
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:09,883
And, I'm an alcoholic.

8
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:10,917
I say we mutiny.

9
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,352
We'll call it "jeff's mutiny."

10
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:13,954
This lifelong vow thing.

11
00:00:13,956 --> 00:00:16,389
Is gonna be a lot harder
to get out of than we thought.

12
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,525
You got weak, walsh.

13
00:00:18,527 --> 00:00:20,093
Do you think
this is going to work?

14
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:21,261
I have to try.

15
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,438
So...

16
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,206
Eric said this was okay?

17
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:36,676
Why did you bring a human
on the ship?

18
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:38,545
As a trophy.

19
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:41,281
Jonathan, you are wicked.

20
00:00:41,283 --> 00:00:43,216
Where should we mount his head?

21
00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:46,753
Maybe somewhere public, to
motivate and inspire the others?

22
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,556
Yeah...

23
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:52,292
Sick asshole
wants to mount his head.

24
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:56,029
I hope this chamber works.

25
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:58,131
I mean, it worked for kurt.

26
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:02,636
Of course, humans are
a more simplistic lifeform.

27
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:04,838
He's lying there because of me.

28
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,172
I got to make it right.

29
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:08,241
I have a confession.

30
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:14,180
I, - I, too, got close to
one of my subjects... kelly.

31
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:17,050
In starcrossed? You dirty dog.

32
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:19,953
Yeah. We, - we broke up,

33
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,023
And now I'm an alcoholic.

34
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:24,090
What? Yeah.

35
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:25,325
You drank one day.

36
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:27,827
And now I'm on that road
to recovery.

37
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,096
There's been a security breach!

38
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:31,464
We have an intruder.

39
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:35,502
It's in there.
Eric wants us to get rid of it.

40
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:38,171
I don't see anything.

41
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:40,006
There!

42
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:43,476
It's a bee.

43
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,912
I heard about a guy on another
ship that got stung by one,

44
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:46,880
And his head exploded.

45
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:48,615
That definitely didn't happen.

46
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:50,483
You weren't there. Yeah, you
guys brought the bee up here.

47
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,885
You were both down on earth.

48
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:52,752
So was kurt!

49
00:01:52,754 --> 00:01:54,888
Ddo not blame kurt!

50
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,556
You know, I bet you it was don.

51
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,892
I... guys, if we can't
get rid of a bee,

52
00:01:58,894 --> 00:02:01,161
How are we gonna get rid
of a cube?

53
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,796
Guys, the bee's moving.

54
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:07,300
Holy shit! It flies!

55
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:10,136
Aah! Aah! Run for your lives!

56
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:12,939
Aah! Get away!

57
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:19,312
Guys, it's got me cornered!

58
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:22,015
The other day,
I tried to order a burrito.

59
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,150
Well, I ordered the burrito,
but then, I couldn't eat it,

60
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:25,385
Because it reminded me of ozzie.

61
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:27,787
Tastes and smells
will often remind us.

62
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:29,956
Of the people that we love,
so...

63
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,460
Why not try switching
to enchiladas for a while?

64
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:36,763
Ii'm sorry. Can we stop talking
about burritos?

65
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:39,199
Alex foster has not returned
any of my calls... right?

66
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,135
And I have a lot of valuable
information to share with her.

67
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:43,803
Yeah. What is up with that?

68
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,805
Is anyone trying
to solve ozzie's case?

69
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:47,607
I talked to the fbi
for 20 minutes,

70
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:49,809
And they did not write down
a single thing that I said.

71
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:51,778
Well, what were they
supposed to write down?

72
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,013
What the inside of her car
looked like?

73
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,781
Weren't you handcuffed
the whole time?

74
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:59,352
Guys, an american journalist
was murdered on u.S. Soil.

75
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:03,390
There is no fbi followup,
no news coverage.

76
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,791
That doesn't sound strange
to you guys?

77
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:06,926
The news doesn't usually cover
heart attacks,

78
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:08,795
Unless it's someone,
you know, super famous.

79
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:10,230
A soapopera star.
Soap opera stars.

80
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,098
Yeah, well, I'm gonna tell
you guys something right now

81
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,101
I don't know about y'all,
but I'm not healing.

82
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:18,571
Until whoever killed ozzie
is behind bars, or worse.

83
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,306
This is an fbi coverup.

84
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:23,276
Area 51, roswell, jimmy hoffa...

85
00:03:23,278 --> 00:03:24,878
Now ozzie graham.

86
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,050
That's it. Raise your hands
if you think this is a coverup.

87
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:33,119
Okay, fine. I admit it...
It reeks of a coverup.

88
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:34,121
It does.

89
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:42,462
<i>Traffic on i40
will be delayed for some time.</i>

90
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,166
<i>Now over to ozzie graham
for a breaking news bulletin.</i>

91
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:47,500
<i>Thanks, sue.</i>

92
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:49,836
<i>Disgraces fbi agent alex foster.</i>

93
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:53,139
<i>Has been suspended
indefinitely by the fbi.</i>

94
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,341
<i>This is the latest
in a pattern of rejection.</i>

95
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:58,144
<i>That began with her parents
abandoning her as an infant.</i>

96
00:03:58,146 --> 00:04:01,214
<i>Sources say she's moping around,</i>

97
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:06,086
<i>Feeling sorry for herself while
my killers remain at large.</i>

98
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:11,191
<i>So, next up we have a
spectacular goldlink bracelet.</i>

99
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:13,293
<i>Now, if you think
this is beautiful on tv,</i>

100
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:17,697
<i>It is about 1,000 times
more beautiful in person.</i>

101
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:21,167
Sorry, ozzie.

102
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:24,237
Looks like I won't get the
chance to catch your killer.

103
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:31,211
The fact that chelsea
was even willing to do this.

104
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:32,412
Gives me hope.

105
00:04:32,414 --> 00:04:34,581
And I know that, with your help,

106
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,983
We can get our marriage
back on track.

107
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,653
It's always good to have hope,
john.

108
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:46,659
But have you thought about
how healthy...

109
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,194
A divorce might be?

110
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:51,664
Divorce? We didn't come here
to talk about divorce.

111
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,932
I would be doing you.

112
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:55,201
A disservice
as a marriage counselor.

113
00:04:55,203 --> 00:04:58,004
If I wasn't willing
to discuss all possible options.

114
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,407
I don't think we should talk
about in our first session.

115
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:04,277
Well, doug is the counselor,
honey, right?

116
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,979
So let's let him counsel.

117
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:07,747
But...

118
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:11,084
You are the only good thing
in my life, chelsea.

119
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:15,288
Why don't we try imagining life
without chelsea.

120
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,692
Just imagine... imagine doing
whatever... whatever it is.

121
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,561
That gives you joy,

122
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:24,364
Without me coming home
and nagging you.

123
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,499
"Pick up those socks!

124
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:29,235
Take a bath!"

125
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:32,005
It says that bees are
the deadliest nonhuman animal.

126
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:33,206
In america.

127
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,642
You're only looking at
the bad side of bees.

128
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:39,012
They also pollinate flowers,
and they make honey.

129
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:41,948
Tell that to the 53 people
that died last year.

130
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,782
It's blood honey.

131
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:44,317
Holy shit!

132
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,852
Don't do that!

133
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:48,321
It's not funny.
It's pretty funny.

134
00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:51,024
Geez, come on.

135
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:54,194
I said stop it. Knock it off.

136
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:55,395
Okay, that wasn't me.

137
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,599
It's back. No! I'm gonna die!

138
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:00,934
The bee's out to get me!

139
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:02,468
Wait, wait! Hold on a sec. Wait!

140
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,637
Where are you going?
Go away, bee.

141
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,006
Shoo! Go, bee!

142
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:09,876
Come on. That's it, bee.
Come on.

143
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:13,379
Come on, bee.
Look at this big yellow flower.

144
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:16,216
And... Fetch!

145
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,287
It worked.

146
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:22,455
Where'd you get that flower?

147
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:23,489
Don's desk.

148
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:26,359
Damn it, don! What?

149
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:27,493
You brought the bee on the ship!

150
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:31,130
Tha... shoot.

151
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:33,666
Dante should've been here
seven minutes ago.

152
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:35,001
Doesn't he care about his job?

153
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:37,437
No,
I know I'm getting a free pizza.

154
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,173
That's where this conversation
is<i> starting.</i>

155
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:43,643
That better be dante.

156
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,149
You're not pizza.

157
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:58,566
Do you want to open a window?
Sort of a strong smell.

158
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:00,701
It's the smell of failure.

159
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,570
You get used to it
after a while.

160
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:04,505
Yeah. Smells a lot like
my divorce.

161
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,541
There you go. So, what brings
you guys to albuquerque?

162
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:08,943
Meth?

163
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,812
Okay. We're here to get
the truth about how ozzie died.

164
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:15,282
Well, you might want to call the
cops, because I can't help you.

165
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:16,650
I got suspended from the fbi.

166
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:18,118
Suspended? Why?

167
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,387
Because I'm a terrible agent.

168
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,123
I let walsh get away,
and a man died on my watch.

169
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,658
So you're just gonna give up?

170
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,160
Yeah. I think so.

171
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:30,731
Yyou can't just quit.

172
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,399
We need your help
to find answers.

173
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:34,435
All right. Whatever happened
to that alex foster.

174
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:35,936
That kept me handcuffed
to her car.

175
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:39,073
And would not allow me a pee
break for the entire ride.

176
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,835
Because she was so determined
to catch walsh?

177
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:43,744
She got her ass handed to her.

178
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:46,547
And now she's wearing the same
pajamas she's been wearing.

179
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,681
For six days in a row.

180
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:49,884
Ew. Okay, alex.

181
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,820
Did annie give up when
miss hannigan tricked her...

182
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:54,221
Don't... And kidnapped her...

183
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,856
Don't you dare.
And she ran away.

184
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:58,726
And went up that crazy, weird
crane thing and risked her life?

185
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,561
Don't bring my favorite musical
into this.

186
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,296
I know what you're doing.
Is it working?

187
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:05,032
No.

188
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:06,500
Look, I get it.

189
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:09,336
I've been here with
the fried rice and the box wine,

190
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:11,906
And I got to say,
ozzie deserves better.

191
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:16,377
All right, I'll...
I'll tell you what I'll do.

192
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:19,179
I will talk to the agent
who's on the case now,

193
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:20,581
And I'll set up a meeting.

194
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,515
But that's
all I am promising you.

195
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:22,983
Okay. Okay.

196
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:25,319
And as a mentalhealth
professional and a friend,

197
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:26,987
Honestly,
you should really just take...

198
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:28,555
I know. I'm gonna shower.
You're gonna feel better.

199
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:30,758
Yeah. And we'd like to
stay here tonight.

200
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,060
Do you have a spare room?

201
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:34,561
I'm so sorry.

202
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,864
Going to you for the marriage
counseling was john's idea,

203
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:39,600
And I thought if I said no,
then he'd be suspicious.

204
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,702
No, yeah. I... I understand.

205
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:43,737
It's just...
It's incredibly awkward.

206
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:46,974
I have to say, chelsea, he seems
sincere about reconciling.

207
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,742
I know. He's doing these...

208
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:51,445
These different things in bed,
as well. He's trying...

209
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,013
No. Okay. You know what?
Forget it.

210
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,615
Okay. I just... I think that
it's too little too late,

211
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,016
Doug, really, I do.

212
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:58,352
I'm sorry, but I'm just gonna
rip this marriage off.

213
00:08:58,354 --> 00:08:59,520
Like a bandaid.

214
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:02,089
I think it's for the best,
right?

215
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,157
Doug!

216
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,825
I'm nodding. Yes.

217
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:06,193
I forgot you can't see me.

218
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:07,594
I'm nodding. I agree, I agree.

219
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,964
We can't have screwups
like this.

220
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:10,965
You always do this.

221
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,200
I've never brought up a bee
before.

222
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:14,902
No, not a bee.

223
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:16,704
But do you remember that time
you brought up that human cold,

224
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,272
And I was sick for months?

225
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:20,174
And you seem to have forgotten
the biggest screwup...

226
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:22,743
The time that you brought up a
human woman filled with babies.

227
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:24,244
Yeah, I forgot about that one.

228
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:28,782
I didn't know. She was wearing
a very flowy dress.

229
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:31,452
What's wrong with this subject?

230
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:32,753
I don't know.

231
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:35,255
There's something
coming out of her.

232
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:36,256
There is?

233
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:38,258
Don!

234
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,526
She's giving birth.

235
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,395
Aah!

236
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:45,432
Wow. What? That is beautiful.

237
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,337
What the hell is that?

238
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,505
It's a human baby.

239
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,741
Get it away from me.

240
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:58,012
Where's the mother?

241
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:58,946
She just left.

242
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,881
She... wha... what do you mean?

243
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:02,449
Another baby
was coming out of her.

244
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,151
I beamed her back down.

245
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:05,753
Where? I don't know.

246
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:07,921
Somewhere on earth.
I had to act fast.

247
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:09,623
Who knows how many more
she had in there.

248
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,158
I don't want a ship
full of babies.

249
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,559
What do I do with this one?

250
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:13,727
You brought her up here
in the first place.

251
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:14,862
You figure it out.

252
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,930
Not my circus, not my monkey.

253
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:20,467
I wonder
whatever happened to her.

254
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:21,835
I hope she's safe.

255
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:25,539
You hope<i> she's</i> safe.
What about me?

256
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,207
That bee could be anywhere.

257
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,443
Just like that baby.

258
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:31,078
Excuse me.

259
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,248
I have an appointment on earth.

260
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,883
Hey, don,

261
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,419
Make sure you bring us back
some scorpions.

262
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,521
Yeah, oor a rattlesnake.

263
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:44,658
Hi. Chelsea?

264
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,393
Hi. I did it.

265
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,596
I told john about us
and that I want a divorce.

266
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:52,199
You... you did?
How did he take it?

267
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,734
You know, um...

268
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,536
Well, not... not very well.

269
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:56,537
That's actually
why I'm... I'm calling.

270
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:57,738
He wants to talk to you.

271
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,406
To me? About what? I don't know.

272
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,576
He mentioned something about
maybe kicking your ass.

273
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,753
All right.
Here's our guy, ramirez.

274
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,388
He's a good agent,
but just so you know,

275
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,956
He's a little obsessed with me.

276
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,425
Do you want me to act
like your boyfriend?

277
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,394
No, please don't. Don't do that.

278
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:21,562
No? We're here.

279
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:23,630
Don't. I'm so glad you called.

280
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:25,432
I've been really wanting
to see you.

281
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,900
Who are these people?

282
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:29,503
"These people"?
We're concerned citizens.

283
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:30,938
Actually, we're your bosses.

284
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,240
Our taxes pay your salary, guy.

285
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:34,975
They knew ozzie graham.

286
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:37,644
I'm sorry for your loss.

287
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:39,046
Are you? Are you?

288
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:41,348
He just said he was.
What's wrong with this guy?

289
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,884
Richard. Just... Okay.

290
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:45,452
This is everything on the case.

291
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,588
Feels light.

292
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,022
There's hardly anything in here.

293
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:50,924
I put a gift in there for you.

294
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:52,759
Where's ozzie's stuff?

295
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:54,328
That's all they gave me. What?

296
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,796
I worked on the case
for one day,

297
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,898
And then agent saunders
told me to shut it down.

298
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,866
It's been officially closed.

299
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:00,200
It's been closed?

300
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:03,003
But walsh is still missing.
A man died.

301
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:04,538
There's a killer at large.

302
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
Look, you didn't get this
from me.

303
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,809
Except for the gift.

304
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,812
It's a bracelet. I don't
I don't want it.

305
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,615
Well, can I... you can't.

306
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:16,550
Can I call... no.

307
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,922
Coverup!

308
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,375
I can't believe the fbi would
tamper with evidence.

309
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,178
Ozzie's laptop, his journal, his
phone... they're all missing.

310
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,679
What kind of world do we live in.

311
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:31,181
If you can't trust
a government agency?

312
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,183
Try the real one, okay?
Look at this.

313
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,352
Almost the whole report's
been redacted...

314
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,255
My thirdman theory, the bright
light, ozzie's last words.

315
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,590
Wait. Ozzie said something
to you before he died?

316
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,628
Ozzie, what happened?
Are you okay?

317
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,464
Trust walsh... Ozzie, it's okay.
I'll get help.

318
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,332
Find the others.

319
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:51,902
"Find the others."

320
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,404
God, it still haunts me.
"find the others."

321
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:58,909
What does that mean? Other aliens,
other experiencers, other...

322
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,744
"others." and the bright light.

323
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,679
I mean,
why would they redact that?

324
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,980
I don't even know what it was.

325
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:05,482
Meh! Survey says... aliens.

326
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,151
Why else would they redact
all of your findings?

327
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:11,421
It sounds like you saw something
that they don't want explained.

328
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:15,325
But you know who are experts
at the unexplainable?

329
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,560
Starcrossed.

330
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,595
The fbi may have given up
on ozzie, but we won't.

331
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,430
We may not surveillance
capabilities,

332
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,899
The parking situation
at the church is not ideal...

333
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:25,268
It's not. And, honestly,
that ant problem is terrible.

334
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,903
It's so gross. It's really bad.

335
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:28,505
But we will listen to you,

336
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:32,042
And we promise not to redact
anything that you say.

337
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,212
Everyone? So sorry.

338
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,746
Rehearsals are cancelled,
please.

339
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:38,615
Please, practice at home.
Thank you.

340
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:39,583
Thank you, linda.
Thank you, all.

341
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,884
Rehearse at home.

342
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,487
Exit, please.
Please exit, thank you.

343
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,689
Can I, - can I have a word
with you, father?

344
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,258
No.

345
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,360
Um...

346
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,533
This is a sacred area!
You're not allowed up here.

347
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,803
My<i> wife</i> was a sacred area.

348
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,673
You... Okay.

349
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,610
Oy, my bobby!

350
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,745
John, stop it!

351
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,213
He's a priest!

352
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:12,816
He's a wifestealer!
No, john, stop it!

353
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,951
Fighting doug
won't solve anything!

354
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:17,454
I don't love you anymore!
I love doug!

355
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,529
You love him? Yeah.

356
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,031
I love you, too, chelsea.

357
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,737
John, I'm sorry.

358
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,238
Our marriage is over.

359
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,574
It has been for a...

360
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,843
A lllong while.

361
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:43,513
I know. I know it is.

362
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,715
I cheated on you again.

363
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,584
With a lady at a gas station.

364
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,054
I have a problem.

365
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:58,028
I'd like to share a story about
something I did a long time ago.

366
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,063
That weighs heavily on my heart.

367
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,865
I was delivering a baby.

368
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,901
When, suddenly,
the mother disappeared.

369
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:08,138
I tried to find her,
but I could not.

370
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,274
So I did the only thing
I could think of.

371
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,425
Goodbye, little one.

372
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,046
I just...

373
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:52,148
Always felt guilty
about abandoning her,

374
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,451
And I'm worried
that she never found her family.

375
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,587
Or that she grew up
all alone inside of a store.

376
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,457
We all do a lot of messedup
stuff when we're drunk.

377
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,060
I wasn't drunk. This is
<i>way</i> before drinking, ever.

378
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:06,663
I never heard about alcohol
when this happened.

379
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,431
You drank after?

380
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,834
No, no.
I just read your pamphlet,

381
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,435
And I'd like to make amends.

382
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:14,671
I understand it's step nine?
Yeah.

383
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:18,808
That's great, don, but the steps
need to be done sequentially.

384
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,278
I know. So I did steps
one through eight this morning,

385
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,713
'cause I really want to help
this baby find its mother.

386
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,815
Want to make it right.

387
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:28,652
This is jeff.

388
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:33,490
If you're listening to this,
it means I'm dead.

389
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,092
This is a record
of our last moments.

390
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:39,963
Our ship was boarded
by a hostile intruder...

391
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,097
A bee.

392
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:42,365
What are you doing?

393
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:43,600
I'm making a record.

394
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,835
Future generations
should know how we died.

395
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:47,203
No one's dead yet.

396
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:49,105
We've got the bee trapped
in the airlock.

397
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:50,940
What? Why didn't you tell me?

398
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:52,108
You're welcome. Okay.

399
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,476
Now that you're safe,

400
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,378
I've got some unfinished
business to take care of.

401
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,049
Good news.
I successfully captured the bee.

402
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,318
Crisis averted.

403
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:04,387
Yeah.

404
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:06,756
It's in there.

405
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,124
Now, when I press this button,

406
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:09,826
The bee will get
sucked out into space.

407
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,395
Let me do it. No, I trapped it.
I'm doing it.

408
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:13,863
Well,
let's do it together, then.

409
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:16,533
On the count of three.
Okay, on three.

410
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,735
One...

411
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,470
Ha!

412
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,639
I got rid of the bee!

413
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,941
Now I can tell eric
I saved the ship,

414
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,509
And it'll be the truth.

415
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:29,412
You bastard. You're a sore loser.
Suck it, kurt.

416
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:33,817
So, as far as the fbi is
concerned, the case is closed.

417
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,485
"Heart attacks."

418
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,619
No, this is bullshit.

419
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:38,488
This would never happen
at the post office.

420
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,157
They make a bigger deal
about losing a package.

421
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:43,293
We're talking about a man's life
here, people.

422
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,228
A man's life. Yeah, ii'm not,

423
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,164
Like, a huge
conspiracytheory wing nut,

424
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,866
Like... Excuse me.

425
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:53,169
But this situation
just jumped from suspicious.

426
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:54,504
To shady as hell.

427
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,906
Sorry. No offense.

428
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,442
No, no, no. It's okay.
It's why I'm here.

429
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,745
I really want to help you guys
get to the truth.

430
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,081
If only there was something that
could help explain all this.

431
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,016
I wonder what it could be, alex?

432
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:08,585
Aliens.

433
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,686
At this point, gerry,

434
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,055
I'm open to entertaining
all possibilities,

435
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,324
Because ozzie deserves justice.

436
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,860
But, for the record,
I still think it's russians.

437
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,061
Russians?! Nope. Nope.

438
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,929
We just talked about
how it's aliens.

439
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:22,699
Wrong! Russians. Ooh!

440
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,300
We don't know
it's<i> not</i> the russians.

441
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:25,462
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys,

442
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,644
We're welcoming a new member, we
don't know it's<i> not</i> okay? Ussians.

443
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,978
Taking a new path can be scary.

444
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,215
But we must not be afraid
to do that that is right...

445
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,618
Even if no one agrees with you,

446
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,621
Even if it's hard...
Especially if it's hard.

447
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,923
You meet someone who,

448
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:49,393
Changes your life
in a way you never expected.

449
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,729
I've met that someone.

450
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:56,767
And I'm going to walk down
a new path with her.

451
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:00,170
Today is my last homily.

452
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,640
From... from today on,

453
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,708
I will no longer be
father doug...

454
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,513
But just doug.

455
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:38,575
Whoever this is,
you're making a big mistake.

456
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,411
This isn't a mistake.

457
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,046
It's payback.

458
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,633
All right.

459
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,901
I dug my own grave.

460
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,103
All right,
now comes the hard part...

461
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,571
You have to kill me.

462
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,006
I'm calling your bluff.

463
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,808
Is that so?

464
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,444
That's just pointing,
that's not killing.

465
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,546
Killing's harder. Look...

466
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,149
You've gone soft.

467
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,317
That's all right.

468
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,287
I mean, you're a disgrace
to your own species.

469
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,925
We're gonna find all you
traitors who've gone soft.

470
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,594
You can't hide forever.

471
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,629
I'm glad I killed
your human friend...
