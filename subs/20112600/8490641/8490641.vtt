This'll only take a few minutes.

12
00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:54.418
The World Rally Championship

13
00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:56.507
has grown in popularity
in recent years

14
00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:59.423
to become the number one
TV sport in the world.

15
00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.860
Drivers like Walter Roöhrl
and the Queen of Speed,

16
00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:04.384
Michele Mouton, have
become household names.

17
00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:06.430
This week we turn our attention

18
00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:09.215
to the key players off the
track, the team managers.

19
00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.958
We're joined by team
manager, Cesare Fiorio,

20
00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:14.873
hailing from Turin, Italy.

21
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.920
Fiorio has led both Fiat
and Lancia to victory.

22
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.532
Mr. Fiorio,
pleased to meet you.

23
00:02:22.402 --> 00:02:24.926
My pleasure.
But please, call me Cesare.

24
00:02:25.013 --> 00:02:27.015
Cesare, I'd like to
start by asking you

25
00:02:27.102 --> 00:02:29.540
what drew you to rallying?

26
00:02:29.627 --> 00:02:33.326
Well, probably because
I love the speed and the risk.

27
00:02:33.457 --> 00:02:35.198
Is that not true of
any other motor sport?

28
00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:37.417
Oh, rallying is
very different.

29
00:02:37.504 --> 00:02:39.245
Rallying belongs to everyone.

30
00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.030
Let's say
it's a democratic sport.

31
00:02:42.117 --> 00:02:43.684
What do you mean by that?

32
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:45.860
It's very difficult
to explain rally.

33
00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:47.949
You have to live it.

34
00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:53.346
You see, the spectators,
they feel the same speed
as the drivers,

35
00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:56.697
because you know, you
race in your own town.

36
00:02:56.784 --> 00:02:59.744
The cars hurtle past
your children's school,

37
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.964
the cafe where you used to have
your coffee, normal places.

38
00:03:03.051 --> 00:03:05.924
Rallying isn't
as well known in the US.

39
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:08.970
Could you tell our
listeners what your role is?

40
00:03:09.057 --> 00:03:13.758
Let's say rallying is like
a war, and
I'm the commander of an army.

41
00:03:13.845 --> 00:03:16.978
The world championship
is made up of 13 trials

42
00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:20.199
divided into grueling stages,

43
00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:25.552
long transfers, by day,
by night, in dust, sand,
snow, rain, you know.

44
00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:27.641
But what is
it exactly that you do?

45
00:03:29.513 --> 00:03:32.951
What I do is to make decisions
in the shortest possible time.

46
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:35.954
So if we look at the results
of last year's championship,

47
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:37.695
we could say that your rival,

48
00:03:37.782 --> 00:03:41.829
Roland Gumpert, made
better decisions than you.

49
00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:44.963
What does Audi
have that you don't?

50
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.532
Well, an entire industrial
and financial sector

51
00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:51.274
that supports research
and development.

52
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:53.450
Do you know the four-wheel
drive is derived

53
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.148
from military technology?

54
00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.237
They really did bring the army.

55
00:04:00.457 --> 00:04:03.808
Rallying is a dangerous sport.
Does anything frighten you?

56
00:04:05.636 --> 00:04:06.463
Yeah.

57
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.160

00:12:28.965 --> 00:12:31.445
Very light. We'll be flying.

178
00:12:32.446 --> 00:12:35.667
And who's going to
drive this car?
Will you drive it, Fiorio?

179
00:12:37.843 --> 00:12:38.801
No.

180
00:12:40.454 --> 00:12:41.673
The best driver will.

181
00:12:45.372 --> 00:12:47.810

182
00:12:55.078 --> 00:12:58.298

[soft music]

185
00:13:14.749 --> 00:13:15.620
Morning.

186
00:13:17.622 --> 00:13:20.494
[setting brake]

187
00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:23.149
[soft music]

188
00:13:32.593 --> 00:13:33.464
Walter,

189
00:13:35.335 --> 00:13:36.554
it's Cesare.

190
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:38.512
[Walter] Ah, Cesare.

191
00:13:38.643 --> 00:13:40.427
Nice to see you.

192
00:13:40.514 --> 00:13:41.559
[Cesare] Can I take off this?

193
00:13:41.733 --> 00:13:44.170
[Walter] Take it off, yeah.

194
00:13:44.257 --> 00:13:45.911
Sorry if I didn't tell
you that I was coming,

195
00:13:46.085 --> 00:13:48.783
but you know.
What happened to your face?

196
00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:51.961
Ah, I spent a lifetime
telling people

197
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:53.223
not to walk in the mountains

198
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.311
with their hand in
their pockets.

199
00:13:54.398 --> 00:13:55.312
And then I.

200
00:13:56.574 --> 00:13:58.489
[laughing] You did it.

201
00:13:58.576 --> 00:14:00.491
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

202
00:14:00.621 --> 00:14:03.581
I, I came to visit
this young pilot.

203
00:14:03.755 --> 00:14:05.975
Very good driver, very talented.

204
00:14:06.105 --> 00:14:07.628
And then I said to myself,

205
00:14:07.715 --> 00:14:09.413
well, I'm very close
to Walter's house,

206
00:14:09.543 --> 00:14:11.894
and why don't you go to
say hello? And here I am,

207
00:14:14.374 --> 00:14:15.245
My bees.

208
00:14:16.594 --> 00:14:18.726
- I see.
- They're strange, huh?

209
00:14:18.813 --> 00:14:22.165
I mean, they're not domesticated
and they're not wild.

210
00:14:22.252 --> 00:14:23.427
They're a mix.

211
00:14:24.602 --> 00:14:27.431
They're creatures capable
of maintaining relationships

212
00:14:27.518 --> 00:14:29.607
with humans without losing
their freedom.

213
00:14:31.478 --> 00:14:32.566
Isn't that wonderful?

214
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:34.829
Incredible creatures.

215
00:14:37.702 --> 00:14:42.228
So did you, did you
sign up with someone yet?

216
00:14:43.969 --> 00:14:46.319
I've had lots of offers,
I'm weighing them up.

217
00:14:48.582 --> 00:14:51.977
And you, how's the
development coming along?

218
00:14:52.064 --> 00:14:54.240
You've got a competitive
car this year?

219
00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:58.505
Yeah. Special car.
Very incredible car.

220
00:14:58.592 --> 00:15:00.681
Central engine, very powerful,

221
00:15:00.768 --> 00:15:04.598
light car using very
special materials, yeah.

222
00:15:04.729 --> 00:15:05.991
You'll see.

223
00:15:06.078 --> 00:15:07.514
Four wheel drive?

224
00:15:07.601 --> 00:15:09.952
No, no, no, no.
Two wheel drive.

225
00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:12.258
You can't beat them
with a normal car.

226
00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:13.172
Yes we can.

227
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.131
No you can't.

228
00:15:20.614 --> 00:15:21.833
You wanna try the honey?

229
00:15:23.008 --> 00:15:25.750
No. No actually I have to go.

230
00:15:25.837 --> 00:15:28.448
I'm very late, I have to
to drive back to Turin.

231
00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:32.322
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

232
00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:38.806
Cesare, the young
driver, what's his name?

233
00:15:38.893 --> 00:15:40.852
Oh, it's a German name.

234
00:15:40.983 --> 00:15:45.204
I forgot, it's very difficult
name, can't remember. See you.

235
00:15:46.336 --> 00:15:47.163
See you.

236
00:16:02.917 --> 00:16:04.963
What did he want from you?

237
00:16:07.096 --> 00:16:08.880
Guess.

238
00:16:10.316 --> 00:16:13.015

[customers chatting]

248
00:17:31.267 --> 00:17:33.312
- Excuse me.
- [Waiter] Yes?

249
00:17:33.443 --> 00:17:35.836
May I have a coffee and
some croissants please?

250
00:17:35.923 --> 00:17:37.273
We don't have croissants,

251
00:17:37.447 --> 00:17:39.971
but I can bring you
some bread if you wish.

252
00:17:40.972 --> 00:17:42.626
Okay, some bread. Thanks.

253
00:17:45.672 --> 00:17:48.849
Did you remember the name of the
young driver you came to see?

254
00:17:51.287 --> 00:17:52.984
Yes, of course. Kurt.

255
00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:59.251
Oh. Him, you mean?

256
00:18:02.689 --> 00:18:06.563
Listen Walter, let's be
honest with each other. Hm?

257
00:18:06.737 --> 00:18:10.262
You have to come
to try this car.
We can win only if you drive it.

258
00:18:13.352 --> 00:18:16.007
I really don't want to compete
in this championship.

259
00:18:17.617 --> 00:18:19.315
You know what it is, Cesare?

260
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.317
I'm tired.

261
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.104
Tired of photographers,
hotels, autographs.

262
00:18:26.191 --> 00:18:29.412
I'm tired of winning, but
that's all you care about.

263
00:18:32.284 --> 00:18:35.679
Yeah, it's true. What's wrong
with it? That's my job.

264
00:18:44.992 --> 00:18:47.256
Give me one good reason
why I should accept.

265
00:18:53.827 --> 00:18:55.960
Because we are the underdogs,

266
00:18:56.047 --> 00:19:01.705
and it's perfect if you're
tired of winning, isn't it?

267
00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:06.188
- Are you staying overnight sir?
- No, sir's leaving.

268
00:19:15.632 --> 00:19:18.374

272
00:19:45.139 --> 00:19:46.402
Yes, it's good.

273
00:19:46.489 --> 00:19:48.012
- What is it?
- Zero-forty.

274
00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:50.101
I would try another test

275
00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:52.625
and reduce the tire
pressure to 1.7.

276
00:19:52.843 --> 00:19:55.062
- I'd lighten the
clutch a little.
- OK.

277
00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:59.415
[tires squealing]

278
00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:04.898
Very good, Marco. Well done.

279
00:20:05.551 --> 00:20:07.814
Zero-forty. Excellent time.

280
00:20:08.467 --> 00:20:09.903
Good.

[tires squealing,

289
00:21:50.917 --> 00:21:53.442
- Does it have a name?
- Yeah.

290
00:21:53.616 --> 00:21:55.705
0' 37" is the new track record.

291
00:21:55.792 --> 00:21:56.793
[Walter] Nice car.

292
00:21:57.837 --> 00:21:59.012
Do you like it or not?

293
00:22:00.013 --> 00:22:01.667
Powerful engine, light,

294
00:22:02.538 --> 00:22:04.191
great road holding.

295
00:22:04.278 --> 00:22:06.455
Goes exactly where
I want it to go.

296
00:22:06.629 --> 00:22:08.935
I like a shoe made to
measure for my foot, but

297
00:22:09.849 --> 00:22:10.763
[door closing]

298
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:11.634
it's very fragile.

299
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.072
On asphalt, no one will beat it.

300
00:22:16.769 --> 00:22:19.163
On dirt roads and snow,
it's a coffin.

301
00:22:20.338 --> 00:22:21.470
Do you accept or not?

302
00:22:22.775 --> 00:22:26.605
I'll only do the races
I love, Monte Carlo,
Acropolis, New Zealand.

303
00:22:26.736 --> 00:22:29.826
Five, six races at the most.

304
00:22:29.913 --> 00:22:31.784
Hey, wait a second. What do
you mean five, six races?

305
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:35.266
There are 12. I want to win
the whole title, not half of it.

306
00:22:35.353 --> 00:22:38.878
- Six races. Take
it or leave it.
- But why?

307
00:22:40.489 --> 00:22:41.577
Take it or leave it.

308
00:22:44.014 --> 00:22:45.537
Well, what did Roöhrl say?

309
00:22:51.195 --> 00:22:53.589
He agreed! He agreed!

310
00:22:54.503 --> 00:22:56.026
Go, Kurt!

311
00:22:59.595 --> 00:23:01.945
Allow me
to introduce the new Lancia 037.

312
00:23:02.728 --> 00:23:05.514
[group applauding]

[soft piano music]

314
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.871
1,996 cubic centimeters
of displacement,

310 horsepower,

316
00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:19.789
volumetric compressor,
rear-wheel drive,

317
00:23:19.876 --> 00:23:21.355
with two-wheel drive.

318
00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:25.011
Mr. Fiorio, to have
a four-wheel drive
like the Audi,

319
00:23:25.316 --> 00:23:27.100
you'll need two cars, ja?

320
00:23:27.318 --> 00:23:30.756
Sir, we have a problem.
We don't have enough cars.

321
00:23:31.017 --> 00:23:32.715
Nicolas Muller,
Frankfurter Allgemeine.

322
00:23:36.893 --> 00:23:40.374
As you know, to enter
the world championship,
the rule is

323
00:23:40.462 --> 00:23:42.594
that every automaker
has to produce

324
00:23:42.725 --> 00:23:45.597
a minimum of 200 models
to be placed on the market.

325
00:23:45.684 --> 00:23:47.164
So?

326
00:23:47.686 --> 00:23:49.993
Even if we go at full speed
on the production lines

327
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.995
we won't manage to
make them all.

328
00:23:52.082 --> 00:23:53.562
The inspection's tomorrow.

329
00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:57.566
- How many do we have?
- 103.

330
00:23:58.654 --> 00:24:00.220
But we need 200.

331
00:24:02.309 --> 00:24:03.876
103.

332
00:24:11.754 --> 00:24:14.278
101, 102.

333
00:24:19.152 --> 00:24:21.024
- How many?
- 103.

334
00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:22.721
- 103?
- Yes.

335
00:24:22.808 --> 00:24:25.332
- Where are the others?
- Eh, this parking lot's full.

336
00:24:25.898 --> 00:24:28.771
They're in another parking lot.

337
00:24:28.988 --> 00:24:31.861
Another parking lot?
Let's go, we have other
things to do.

338
00:24:32.078 --> 00:24:34.559
- Let's go, now. All right?
- Yes, let's go, it's nearby.

339
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.909
We'll take the car and go.
It's nearby, come.

340
00:24:37.301 --> 00:24:39.042
The usual Italian chaos.

341
00:24:39.129 --> 00:24:40.565
Italians! Always the same.

342
00:24:44.308 --> 00:24:47.093
[doors closing]

343
00:24:50.923 --> 00:24:52.795
There's a bit of traffic.

344
00:24:58.191 --> 00:25:00.890
[horns honking]

345
00:25:01.847 --> 00:25:05.242
- What now?
- What is it? It's all blocked.

346
00:25:05.459 --> 00:25:07.679
It's blocked. Is the parking lot
still a distance away?

347
00:25:07.766 --> 00:25:11.248
Half an hour. But
I have an idea.

348
00:25:11.335 --> 00:25:14.773
Let's stop. There's a little
restaurant there, we'll stop

349
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:17.297
and have a quick lunch,
then we'll go to
the parking lot.

350
00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:19.691
That way in the meantime...

351
00:25:19.778 --> 00:25:21.867
the traffic will clear a bit.

00:37:31.204 --> 00:37:32.380
There!

527
00:37:33.424 --> 00:37:35.252
- The victory certificate.
- Thank you.

528
00:37:38.168 --> 00:37:40.039
What else do you want,
Fiorio? Eh?

529
00:37:40.126 --> 00:37:41.954
Do you have any aspirin?
I have a headache.

530
00:37:43.956 --> 00:37:46.698
It's OK, sorry. Thank you.

531
00:37:52.965 --> 00:37:54.227
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

532
00:37:54.402 --> 00:37:57.970
Mr. Fiorio, Lancia team manager.

533
00:37:58.057 --> 00:38:02.192
I'm sorry, Fiorio. I'm sorry,
I cannot find you on the list.

534
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:06.065
If you search my name
in the standings, you'll find
it in the first place.

535
00:38:06.152 --> 00:38:07.284
In this list, I don't know.

536
00:38:07.458 --> 00:38:09.199
The dress code is
jacket and tie.

537
00:38:09.286 --> 00:38:11.027
Maybe we can find you jacket.

538
00:38:24.562 --> 00:38:26.999
Are you feeling all right?

539
00:38:27.086 --> 00:38:29.132
You don't, you don't
look so great.

540
00:38:29.262 --> 00:38:32.527
Thanks. I think
I have a temperature.

541
00:38:33.354 --> 00:38:36.400
- Have you taken anything?
- An aspirin.

542
00:38:37.488 --> 00:38:40.578
Ask them for a grog.
Hot rum, honey and lemon.

543
00:38:42.145 --> 00:38:43.233
Take my advice.

Hi.

552
00:40:10.015 --> 00:40:11.452
- Hmm.
- See?

553
00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:13.323
- Are you feeling better?
- Yeah.

554
00:40:13.497 --> 00:40:14.498
What'd I tell you?

555
00:40:16.239 --> 00:40:18.284
By the way, I'm Cesare.
Nice to meet you.

556
00:40:18.459 --> 00:40:19.895
Fiorio, I know.

557
00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:22.811
Is there anyone here
who doesn't know you?

558
00:40:23.159 --> 00:40:25.204
Actually, the people at the
front door, but nevermind.

559
00:40:25.335 --> 00:40:28.469
I mean, what are you
doing here in this circus?

560
00:40:28.599 --> 00:40:29.470
Getting bored.

561
00:40:31.167 --> 00:40:33.082
Well, in that case,
you should go home.

562
00:40:33.169 --> 00:40:36.738
- Yeah.
- But what do you do in life?

563
00:40:36.825 --> 00:40:38.391
I teach nutritional medicine

564
00:40:38.479 --> 00:40:40.089

00:40:53.842 --> 00:40:55.452
- Well, did we really win?
- Yes.

569
00:40:55.626 --> 00:40:56.671
Finally we win.

570
00:40:56.932 --> 00:40:58.716
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

571
00:40:59.412 --> 00:41:03.504
I mean, it went well this time,
but you know, in Sweden,

572
00:41:04.635 --> 00:41:06.681
I need you even more so.

573
00:41:06.768 --> 00:41:08.421
Well, I'm not coming
to Sweden.

574
00:41:10.989 --> 00:41:13.949
Listen, I know you don't
care about, you know,

the driver's championship,

576
00:41:16.517 --> 00:41:17.996
but I have to win.

577
00:41:18.083 --> 00:41:19.476
I have to win the
constructors' one.

578
00:41:19.563 --> 00:41:20.869
You understand that?
Is that clear?

579
00:41:21.043 --> 00:41:22.610
That's your problem, not mine.

580
00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:25.438
I told you that.

581
00:41:33.011 --> 00:41:34.796
Excuse me for a moment,
I'll call you back.

582
00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:39.148
Walter...

583
00:41:39.235 --> 00:41:41.280
is refusing to go to Sweden.

584
00:41:41.498 --> 00:41:44.457
What do you mean, refusing?
It's not like it's
a company outing.

585
00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:46.634
Don't ask me to explain,
it's complicated.

586
00:41:46.764 --> 00:41:48.897
Don't ask me to convince him.
It's impossible.

587
00:41:48.984 --> 00:41:50.202
You asked for him.

588
00:41:52.553 --> 00:41:56.121
I was thinking...
we could simply not
go to Sweden.

589
00:41:56.339 --> 00:41:58.471
What do you mean,
not go to Sweden?

590
00:41:58.559 --> 00:42:00.822
Let's pass this whim
of Walter's off
as a team choice.

591
00:42:01.083 --> 00:42:03.520
If he wants to stay home
to make honey, we have
other drivers.

592
00:42:03.738 --> 00:42:06.305
You know fine we can't win
in the snow without him.

593
00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:08.873
If we stay home,
the Germans will get a fright.

594
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.745
Lancia is so strong

595
00:42:10.832 --> 00:42:12.311
they can afford to skip a round.

596
00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:14.096
- So are we withdrawing?
- No.

597
00:42:14.313 --> 00:42:17.534
We're not withdrawing.
We're just
moving in a different direction.

598
00:42:17.752 --> 00:42:19.710
I've heard bullshit before,
but this really...

599
00:42:19.928 --> 00:42:22.191
Not going to Sweden
will result in huge savings.

600
00:42:22.278 --> 00:42:23.671
Do you know what this
circus costs?

601
00:42:23.888 --> 00:42:26.543
Helicopters, planes, trucks.
40 people to move.

602
00:42:26.804 --> 00:42:29.415
With that money
we could develop the 037.

603
00:42:30.895 --> 00:42:32.331
And win in Portugal.

604
00:42:33.768 --> 00:42:35.857
You take the responsibility
for this.

605
00:42:35.944 --> 00:42:37.206
But if it goes wrong...

606
00:42:37.423 --> 00:42:38.860

[Gumpert] Fantastic.

642

As you were saying,

643
00:45:51.487 --> 00:45:53.881
Audi has invested heavily to
become competitive in rallying,

644
00:45:53.968 --> 00:45:57.972
and this year they're
demonstrating
all their technical strength.

645
00:45:59.277 --> 00:46:01.192
Yeah, but you know,

646
00:46:01.279 --> 00:46:04.717
money and technology are not
enough to win in this sport.

647
00:46:04.805 --> 00:46:06.850
So what do you need to win?

648
00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:10.288
Heart and brain and
a pinch of creativity.

649
00:46:10.375 --> 00:46:14.075
- [Journalist] Ah, talent.
- Hmm, I would say obsession.

650
00:46:14.945 --> 00:46:16.338
Looking at the constructors'
standings,

651
00:46:16.512 --> 00:46:18.122
Audi is ahead of Lancia.

652
00:46:18.209 --> 00:46:21.734
So it doesn't seem
to me that this

653
00:46:21.822 --> 00:46:25.086
obsession is giving you the
results that you wanted.

654
00:46:25.173 --> 00:46:27.915
And yet you're still
fighting your partisan war.

655
00:46:28.002 --> 00:46:33.442
In this business you're very
well known for being creative

656
00:46:33.572 --> 00:46:36.619
and finding solutions
to help you win.

657
00:46:37.489 --> 00:46:38.926
Who says that?

658
00:46:39.535 --> 00:46:43.017
Listen, this is a sport
that's raced on the road.

659
00:46:43.191 --> 00:46:45.671
And on the road, anything goes.

660
00:46:45.758 --> 00:46:47.804
You've dominated the
industry for two decades.

661
00:46:47.978 --> 00:46:51.634
In 1963, you founded
the High Fidelity team.

662
00:46:52.983 --> 00:46:57.031
Do you still feel that you
can ensure this High Fidelity

663
00:46:57.118 --> 00:46:59.598
to the company, to the team?

664
00:47:04.081 --> 00:47:05.474
Yes, I can.

665
00:47:08.172 --> 00:47:10.044
You're being very selfish.

666
00:47:10.218 --> 00:47:14.309
It was a very hot day.
What did you expect?

667
00:47:14.483 --> 00:47:15.919
[Gloria] I like you.

This is who I am.

But this your permanent record,

672
00:47:22.665 --> 00:47:24.058
but you've never been happy.

673
00:47:24.145 --> 00:47:25.407
And I don't want
to live like this.

674
00:47:25.581 --> 00:47:27.235

675
00:47:29.237 --> 00:47:31.456

00:47:51.955 --> 00:47:53.957
Yeah.

679
00:47:54.044 --> 00:47:54.784
Sure?

680
00:47:54.871 --> 00:47:56.177
Yes, sure.

681
00:47:58.222 --> 00:47:59.745
Why are you asking?

682
00:47:59.832 --> 00:48:02.618
We are having a party
because we won.

683
00:48:03.967 --> 00:48:05.490
You still think that the Germans

684
00:48:05.621 --> 00:48:07.536
are only technology and
organization, don't you?

685
00:48:10.669 --> 00:48:13.150
But don't believe all
the cliches, Fiorio.

686
00:48:13.237 --> 00:48:17.024
Because with that car,
you will never win against me.

687
00:48:19.983 --> 00:48:20.853
Another round?

688
00:48:22.725 --> 00:48:24.466
Cheers!

689
00:48:24.945 --> 00:48:28.165
Mr. Fiorio?
We are ready.

690
00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.038
Okay, let's go.

691
00:48:31.125 --> 00:48:33.779
This year to award
the prize to Udo Kurt,

in the Stewart McCoy Memorial,

We have also here tonight,
the daughter of the driver

696
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:48.055
who left us 20 years ago
in a tragic accident.

697
00:48:48.142 --> 00:48:49.970
Ladies and gentlemen,
I ask a round of applause

698
00:48:50.057 --> 00:48:53.886
to the beautiful Jane, daughter
of the great Stuart McCoy!

the young driver the award.

701
00:49:05.724 --> 00:49:06.595
Wow.

702
00:49:08.162 --> 00:49:08.989
Thank you.

703
00:49:10.729 --> 00:49:15.125
I, I'm very delighted to
be here. It's an honor for me.

704
00:49:16.039 --> 00:49:19.042
When I started to
sign with Lancia,

705
00:49:19.216 --> 00:49:21.044
it was like a dream come true

706
00:49:22.524 --> 00:49:23.916
and an emotion
that is indescribable,

707
00:49:24.091 --> 00:49:25.396
so thank you very much.

So, we meet again.

710
00:49:30.184 --> 00:49:32.882
It's not that surprising,
seeing as we're on
the same road.

711
00:49:34.579 --> 00:49:35.624
I knew your father.

712
00:49:37.365 --> 00:49:41.499
Yeah, it seems like everyone
did, and better than me.

713
00:49:42.848 --> 00:49:44.633
I was too young when
it happened.

714
00:49:44.763 --> 00:49:46.983
I remember exactly where
I was the day of the accident.

715
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:48.724
I don't wanna talk about it.

716
00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:54.599
So, what are you doing here?
Getting bored here, too?

717
00:49:56.775 --> 00:49:58.081
Listen, I was thinking,

718
00:49:59.082 --> 00:50:02.216
I mean, I really need
a doctor on my team.

719
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:04.087
I need someone who takes
care of my drivers.

720
00:50:04.174 --> 00:50:07.308
You know, diets,
physical conditions.

721
00:50:07.395 --> 00:50:09.832
I think you are
the right person.

722
00:50:09.962 --> 00:50:13.183
Look, I've spent
my entire life trying to keep
my distance from racing.

723
00:50:14.315 --> 00:50:16.186
I don't think it's a good idea.

724
00:50:16.273 --> 00:50:20.103
I think it could be good
for you, if you join us, hm?

725
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:21.887

- Sir.
- What are you doing?

733
00:51:16.768 --> 00:51:19.336
I understand
how the Audi's exhaust works.

734
00:51:21.121 --> 00:51:23.688
They're made of titanium.
I mean, on a sedan...

735
00:51:23.775 --> 00:51:26.126
so they have a long car,
long exhaust.

736
00:51:26.213 --> 00:51:27.997
So, they've lightened it.

737
00:51:28.084 --> 00:51:31.000
If we could mount
the same exhaust,
we'd go faster.

738
00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:35.352
Are you an engineer? A designer?
Do you have a degree?

- No, I thought...
- There, you mustn't think.

You mustn't think.

- It was about looking
bad in Portugal.
- I heard you.

I looked like shit, not you.
It's me who looks like shit.

to start winning again...</i>

the time check.

you telling me this?

I was wishing him
luck for Finland.

925
01:03:11.743 --> 01:03:13.833
- Why?
- Because I like him.

926
01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:17.053

927
01:03:18.838 --> 01:03:21.188

come to Finland or not?

No.

No, you are coming.

- No, I'm not.
- And don't say I told you.

933
01:03:31.546 --> 01:03:33.113
But I did tell you,
that was the agreement.

you see that doing this

It's possible, maybe yes.

You know what the problem is?

948

It's you not being
scared enough,

949
01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:06.973
because that car
isn't made for jumps.

950

- You knew it before.

01:04:12.717 --> 01:04:13.414

- Now we have a problem.

you're not strong enough.

- No, it's not the point.

I will examine you properly

He was very sorry about
the accident.

1118

The insurance company
will make a payout

- No, and no one's seen her.

The board has already told me

01:16:41.944 --> 01:16:44.686
they don't intend
to renew the racing budget

1123
01:16:44.947 --> 01:16:46.557

1124
01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.952
There might not be a next year.

1125
01:16:50.213 --> 01:16:52.607
Let's face it, Cesare,
like you say:

1126
01:16:52.955 --> 01:16:55.349
no one wants to buy
a car that loses,

1127

[Jane crying]

1134
01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:40.002
You raced as a driver in
the 1961 Monte Carlo rally,

1135
01:17:40.133 --> 01:17:43.049
but you didn't complete
because of an accident.

1136
01:17:43.136 --> 01:17:45.921
Did you become a team manager
because you were scared?

1137
01:17:46.966 --> 01:17:49.011
Sorry, I don't understand
what you're getting at.

1138
01:17:49.185 --> 01:17:51.710
You have your drivers
racing in prototypes,

1139
01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:55.757
normal cars that have
been pushed to the max

1140
01:17:55.844 --> 01:17:59.630
to become really
powerful beasts.

1141
01:17:59.761 --> 01:18:02.721
Do you not feel a sense of
responsibility for your driver

1142
01:18:02.808 --> 01:18:04.679
who was just involved
in an accident?

1143
01:18:07.073 --> 01:18:09.640
Obviously I'm very
worried about the guy,

1144
01:18:09.728 --> 01:18:11.817
but to eliminate
risk from rallying

1145
01:18:11.904 --> 01:18:14.471
would be eliminate
rallying itself.

1146
01:18:14.602 --> 01:18:17.083
Earlier you compared
rallying to war.

1147
01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:18.606
So let me quote
something for you.

1148
01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:20.477
In the "Art of War,"
Sun Tzu writes

1149
01:18:20.564 --> 01:18:23.437
that it's possible to know
how to win

1150
01:18:23.524 --> 01:18:26.745
without actually winning.

1151
01:18:28.007 --> 01:18:29.617
Is that what's happening to you?

1152
01:18:31.532 --> 01:18:34.709
I see you still don't
understand how this sport works.

1153
01:18:34.796 --> 01:18:38.669
Here, you don't race to
overtake the other guy.

1154
01:18:38.757 --> 01:18:40.367
You race against the clock,

1155
01:18:40.454 --> 01:18:43.065
and if you lose, you
lose against yourself.

1156
01:18:43.239 --> 01:18:45.328
Is that how you feel right now?

1157
01:18:45.502 --> 01:18:46.808
What do you mean?

1158
01:18:46.895 --> 01:18:48.941
Like someone
who's going to withdraw

1159
01:18:49.028 --> 01:18:51.334

against himself.

01:18:55.556 --> 01:18:58.777

01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:09.826
Be sure they have some rest.

1237
01:24:10.914 --> 01:24:12.699
Yeah, I'll make them
a herbal tea tonight,

1238
01:24:12.786 --> 01:24:14.527
help them sleep.

1239
01:24:14.614 --> 01:24:16.529
And I've got some maltodextrins
for them in the morning.

1240
01:24:16.659 --> 01:24:19.314
- What are they?
- Relax.

1241
01:24:19.401 --> 01:24:22.491
They're just water-soluble
complex carbohydrates.

1242
01:24:24.232 --> 01:24:26.060
[Cesare] You know what
to do. It's your job.

1243
01:24:26.147 --> 01:24:28.584
Yeah. And what's yours?

1244
01:24:28.715 --> 01:24:31.457
Mine? My job is to win.

1245
01:24:33.633 --> 01:24:35.983
Why is it so important?

1246
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:38.594
I've been with you guys
for a while now and I,

1247
01:24:38.681 --> 01:24:40.944
I still don't understand it.

1248
01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:42.990
Don't try to understand.

1249
01:24:43.077 --> 01:24:45.558
If you try to understand,
you will never win.

1250
01:24:45.732 --> 01:24:48.865
But why do you do it?

1251
01:24:48.952 --> 01:24:51.433
I mean the drivers, my father.

1252
01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.741
Why do they risk their
lives just to win?

1253
01:24:55.872 --> 01:24:59.746
- There's more to it.
- What more is there than life?

1254
01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:01.313
Racing to go nowhere.

1255
01:25:02.401 --> 01:25:03.880
Where is not the point.

1256
01:25:04.707 --> 01:25:05.795
The point is how.

1257
01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:08.581
As fast as you can.

1258
01:25:12.324 --> 01:25:13.151
And death?

1259
01:25:14.978 --> 01:25:16.632
Is it worth it?

1260
01:25:16.719 --> 01:25:19.026
Death is afraid of those
who pursue it.

1261
01:25:21.724 --> 01:25:23.639
Instead of waiting for it,

1262
01:25:23.726 --> 01:25:24.901
we run after it,

1263
01:25:25.772 --> 01:25:27.121
and it moves away.

1264
01:25:31.517 --> 01:25:32.344
Jane?

1265
01:25:35.173 --> 01:25:35.999
Thanks.

1266
01:25:37.436 --> 01:25:39.394
Thank you for
what you're doing for us.

[helicopter thrumming]

1268
01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:50.144
[soft music]

1269
01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:55.976
Roöhrl should arrive at
the time control

1270
01:25:56.063 --> 01:25:57.020
10 minutes earlier.

1271
01:25:58.413 --> 01:26:00.328
[Cesare] Okay, see
you at the checkpoint.

1272
01:26:01.634 --> 01:26:03.723
[ambient music]

1273
01:26:03.810 --> 01:26:06.595
[engine revving]

1274
01:26:07.596 --> 01:26:10.860
[helicopter thrumming]

1275
01:26:19.434 --> 01:26:21.349
What's going on?

1276
01:26:29.923 --> 01:26:31.011
What's wrong man?

1277
01:26:31.098 --> 01:26:32.404
During the road section

1278
01:26:32.621 --> 01:26:33.883
I felt a vibration of
the clutch pedal.

1279
01:26:33.970 --> 01:26:35.842
Sinister noise, so I stopped.

1280
01:26:35.929 --> 01:26:37.322
I think it's the bearing.

1281
01:26:37.496 --> 01:26:38.366
It's the bearing.

1282
01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:39.280
[Cesare] So change it.

1283
01:26:39.411 --> 01:26:40.499
We can't.

1284
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:41.761
What do you mean we can't?

1285
01:26:41.848 --> 01:26:43.502
We don't have another one.

1286
01:26:44.198 --> 01:26:46.156
Why don't we have another
one, sorry?

1287
01:26:46.244 --> 01:26:49.986
Sir, in 10 years of rallying,
I've never seen a
broken bushing.

1288
01:26:50.248 --> 01:26:51.727
Do you realize what
you're saying?

1289
01:26:52.075 --> 01:26:55.078
It's like a pilot not having a
parachute because he's
never crashed!

1290
01:26:55.165 --> 01:26:57.559
Even if we had one...

1291
01:26:57.864 --> 01:26:59.735
We have to be at the
stop control...

1292
01:26:59.822 --> 01:27:02.869
At 12.45, I know what
time we need to be there,
is that clear? I know.

1293
01:27:03.565 --> 01:27:04.914
12.45.

1294
01:27:05.001 --> 01:27:06.307
[Walter] Okay.

1295
01:27:09.571 --> 01:27:12.922
[timer ticking]

1296
01:27:13.009 --> 01:27:15.795
[engine revving]

1297
01:27:23.498 --> 01:27:27.197
Excuse me, are you
saying if we had another bearing
you could change it?

1298
01:27:28.416 --> 01:27:30.766
If we had one,
technically it would
be possible.

1299
01:27:33.856 --> 01:27:36.555
[timer ticking]

1300
01:27:39.209 --> 01:27:42.561
[clock ticking]

1301
01:27:42.691 --> 01:27:45.477
[engine revving]

1302
01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:48.306
There, you see? You
only need to ask.

1303
01:27:53.398 --> 01:27:56.096
- Vuda, come on!
- Sir, again? What's going on?

1304
01:27:56.531 --> 01:27:59.229
Nothing. We need your car.
We need the bushing.

1305
01:27:59.491 --> 01:28:00.709
Come on, go take
a shower, go on.

1306
01:28:00.927 --> 01:28:03.364
Sir, that way Mikkola's first
and Alén second.

1307
01:28:03.451 --> 01:28:06.498
Vudafieri would be
third, the first podium of his
life. It's not fair.

1308
01:28:06.889 --> 01:28:09.065
You have 50 minutes
to change the bushing.

1309
01:28:12.504 --> 01:28:13.722
49.

1310
01:28:13.983 --> 01:28:15.898
- That's not how you win.
- What did you say?

1311
01:28:16.159 --> 01:28:17.726
- That's not how you win.
- So what is?

1312
01:28:17.987 --> 01:28:20.338
- Do you know how to win?
- No, but not like that.

1313
01:28:20.425 --> 01:28:23.166
- What do you know
about winning?
- I'm not doing it.

1314
01:28:23.428 --> 01:28:25.255
Are you kidding?

1315
01:28:26.735 --> 01:28:29.129
- What did you say, sorry?
- I'm not doing it.

1316
01:28:29.216 --> 01:28:30.086
Cesare.

1317
01:28:32.524 --> 01:28:34.526
They just called me
from the hospital,

1318
01:28:35.657 --> 01:28:36.963
Kurt's back with us again.

1319
01:28:39.182 --> 01:28:40.053
Kurt is back.

1320
01:28:42.708 --> 01:28:44.144
He's back with us again.

1321
01:28:57.113 --> 01:28:58.506
Kurt is back.

1322

[soft music]

1323
01:29:02.292 --> 01:29:04.425
Change this fucking bushing.

1324
01:29:05.078 --> 01:29:09.430
Let's go, we have
an hour, come on.
Come on, quick.

We're almost done.

1330
01:29:44.334 --> 01:29:46.424
- Done.
- Come on!

1331
01:29:47.512 --> 01:29:50.036
Walter, you have to fly, okay?

1332
01:29:50.906 --> 01:29:52.168

Good strong team,
so we're sure to win.

1341
01:30:41.696 --> 01:30:43.176
Mikkola is our strongest player.

here, the weather is variable.

01:30:56.319 --> 01:30:58.191
There could be

I can see Roöhrl's Lancia.

1371
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:10.263
He is driving very well.

1372
01:32:10.437 --> 01:32:12.047
According to intermediate time,

1373
01:32:12.178 --> 01:32:14.006
Roöhrl has
12 seconds lead over Mikkola.

1374

1375
01:32:16.008 --> 01:32:16.835
