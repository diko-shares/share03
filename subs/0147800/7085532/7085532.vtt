1
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.890
Hey!

2
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.400
I'll be right with you.

3
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.500
So, Cameron. Here you go.

4
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.250
Nine schools in 10 years.
My, my. Army brat?

5
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.920
- Yeah. My dad is...
- That's enough.

6
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.510
I'm sure you won't find Padua
any different than your old schools.

7
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.270
Same little ass-wipe shit-for-brains
everywhere.

8
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.270
Excuse me? Did you just say...
Am I in the right office?

9
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.110
Not anymore, you're not. I've got
deviants to see and a novel to finish.

10
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.110
Now, scoot. Scoot!

11
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.900
Okay.

12
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.030
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

13
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.620
Patrick Verona.

14
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.290
I see we're making
our visits a weekly ritual.

15
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.960
Only so we can have these moments
together. Should I hit the lights?

16
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.630
Oh, very clever, kangaroo boy.

17
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.220
Says here you exposed yourself
in the cafeteria?

18
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.800
I was joking with the lunch lady.
It was a bratwurst.

19
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.140
Bratwurst?

20
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.430
Aren't we the optimist?

21
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.150
Next time, keep it in your pouch, okay?

22
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.320
Scoot!

23
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.830
Hello! Michael Eckman.
I'm supposed to show you around.

24
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.080
Oh, hi. Thank God. You know...

25
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.000
Normally they send down
one of those audio visual geeks.

26
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.840
No, I do. I know what you mean.

27
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.510
Hey, Michael,
where should I put those slides?

28
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.680
Michael? So... Cameron.

29
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.020
Here's the breakdown. Over there,
we've got your basic beautiful people.

30
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.520
Now listen. Unless they talk
to you first, don't bother.

31
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.610
- Wait. Is that your rule or theirs?
- Watch. Hey, there.

32
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.690
- Eat me.
- You see that?

33
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.690
To the left, we have the coffee kids.

34
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.280
- That was Costa Rican, butthead!
- Very edgy.

35
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.280
Don't make any sudden movements
around them.

36
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.870
These delusionals
are your white Rastas.

37
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.540
They're big Marley fans.
They think they're black.

38
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.540
- Semi-political, but mostly...
- Smoke a lot of weed?

39
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.790
- Yeah. These guys...
- Wait, wait. Let me guess. Cowboys?

40
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.510
Yeah, but the closest they've come
to a cow is McDonald's.

41
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.050
McDonald's.

42
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.050
These are your future Mvys.
We're all Ivy League accepted.

43
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.060
Yuppie greed is back, my friend.

44
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.060
- Hey, guys, how you doin'?
- Close it, Bogey!

45
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.150
- Yesterday, I was their god.
- What happened?

46
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.070
Bogey Lozenstein
started a rumor that I...

47
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.240
That I buy my Izods at an outlet mall.

48
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.240
- So they kicked you out?
- Hostile takeover. But don't worry.

49
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.370
- He'll pay. Now, over here...
- Oh, my God.

50
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.750
- What group is she in?
- The "don't even think about it" group.

51
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.340
That's Bianca Stratford.
She's a sophomore.

52
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.760
I burn, I pine, I perish.

53
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.430
Of course you do.
You know, she's beautiful and deep.

54
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.890
I'm sure.

55
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.100
Yeah, but see, there's a difference
between like and love.

56
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.770
Because I like my Skechers,
but I love my Prada backpack.

57
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.270
But I love my Skechers.

58
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.520
That's because you don't have
a Prada backpack.

59
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.110
Listen, forget her.
Incredibly uptight father.

60
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.280
And it's a widely known fact that

61
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.120
the Stratford sisters
aren't allowed to date.

62
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.790
Yeah.

63
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.870
Whatever.

64
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.720
Okay, then. What did everyone
think of the Sun Also Rises?

65
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.470
I loved it. He's so romantic.

66
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.720
Romantic? Hemingway?

67
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.720
He was an abusive, alcoholic
misogynist who squandered half his life

68
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.310
hanging around Picasso
trying to nail his leftovers.

69
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.980
As opposed to a bitter,
self-righteous hag who has no friends?

70
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.980
Pipe down, Chachi.

71
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.400
I guess in this society,
being male and an asshole

72
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.320
makes you worthy of our time.

73
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.990
What about Sylvia Plath,

74
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.830
or Charlotte Bronte
or Simone de Beauvoir?

75
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.170
What'd I miss?

76
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.500
The oppressive patriarchal values
that dictate our education.

77
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.670
Good.

78
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.590
- Hey, hey!
- Mr. Morgan.

79
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.930
Is there any chance we could get Kat
to take her Midol

80
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.970
before she comes to class?

81
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.010
Someday you're gonna get
bitch-slapped,

82
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.810
and I'm not gonna do a thing to stop it.

83
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.190
And, Kat, I want to thank you
for your point of view.

84
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.770
I know how difficult it must be for you
to overcome all those years

85
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.610
of upper-middle class
suburban oppression.

86
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.190
Must be tough.

87
00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.360
But the next time you storm the P.T.A.,
crusading for better lunch meat,

88
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.370
or whatever it is
you white girls complain about,

89
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.200
ask them why they can't buy a book
written by a black man!

90
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.960
- That's right, mon!
- Don't even get me started on you two.

91
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.710
Anything else?

92
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.380
Yeah, go to the office.
You're pissing me off.

93
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.590
- What? Mr. Morgan...
- Later!

94
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.060
Undulating with desire,

95
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.890
Adrienne removes her red...

96
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.740
Crimson cape

97
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.120
at the sight of Reginald's stiff and...

98
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.750
Judith!

99
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.380
What's another word for "engorged"?

100
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.800
I'll look it up.

101
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.050
Okay.

102
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.760
- Swollen. Turgid.
- Tumescent?

103
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.060
Perfect.

104
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.600
So, I hear you were terrorizing
Mr. Morgan's class again.

105
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.480
Expressing my opinion
is not a terrorist action.

106
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.570
The way you expressed your opinion
to Bobby Ridgezay?

107
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.700
By the way, his testicle
retrieval operation went quite well,

108
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.530
in case you're interested.

109
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.910
I still maintain
that he kicked himself in the balls.

110
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.830
The point is, Kat...

111
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.500
Cat.

112
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.840
People perceive you as somewhat...

113
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.090
Tempestuous?

114
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.140
"Heinous bitch" is
the term used most often.

115
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.940
You might want to work on that.

116
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.980
Thank you.

117
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.610
As always, thank you
for your excellent guidance.

118
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.820
I'll let you get back
to Reginald's quivering member.

119
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.830
"Quivering member." I like that.

120
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.160
Virgin alert. Your favorite.

121
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.590
Lookin' good, ladies.

122
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.340
Oh, she's out of reach, even for you.

123
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.180
- No one's out of reach for me.
- You wanna put money on that?

124
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.220
Money, I've got.

125
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.640
This I'm gonna do for fun.

126
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.150
- Who's that guy?
- That's Joey Donner.

127
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.810
He's a jerk off, and a model.

128
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.440
- He's a model?
- A model.

129
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.780
Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored
to have a big tube sock ad coming out.

130
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.530
- Really?
- Really.

131
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.000
Man, look at her. Is she always so...

132
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.460
- Vapid?
- How can you say that? She's totally...

133
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.330
- Conceited.
- What are you talking about?

134
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.210
There's more to her than you think.

135
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.630
Look at the way she smiles,
and look at her eyes, man.

136
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.050
She's totally pure.
You're missing what's there.

137
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.720
No, no, Cameron, no. What's there

138
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:16.140
is a snotty little princess wearing
a strategically planned sun dress

139
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.650
to make guys like us realize
that we can never touch her

140
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.570
and guys like Joey realize
that they want to.

141
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.280
She, my friend, is what we will spend
the rest of our lives not having.

142
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.360
Put her in your spank bank, move on.

143
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.280
- Move on.
- No, no. You're wrong about her.

144
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.700
I mean, you know,
not about the spanking part,

145
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.160
but the rest, you're wrong.

146
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.790
All right... I'm wrong?
You wanna take a shot, be my guest.

147
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.710
She's actually looking
for a French tutor.

148
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.880
Are you serious? That's perfect!

149
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.960
Do you speak French?

150
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.260
Well, no, but I will.

151
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.060
Hey. Your little Rambo look is out, Kat.

152
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.060
- Didn't you read last month's Cosmo?
- Run along.

153
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.610
I know you can be overwhelmed,
and you can be under whelmed,

154
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.900
but can you everjust be "whelmed"?

155
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.530
- I think you can in Europe.
- Hi, ladies.

156
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.410
Would you szeet young things
like a ride?

157
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.000
Careful on the leather.

158
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.420
That's a charming new development.

159
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.130
It's disgusting.

160
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.350
Remove head from sphincter,
then drive!

161
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.770
- You okay?
- Yeah.

162
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.480
Just a minor encounter with the shrew.

163
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.110
- That's your girlfriend's sister.
- That's Bianca's sister?

164
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.490
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.

165
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.490
- Stay cool, bro.
- Yeah, see you later.

166
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.950
Look out!

167
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.500
My balls! Oh, boy.

168
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.020
Yeah!

169
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.280
Hello, Katarina.
Make anyone cry today?

170
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.240
Sadly, no. But it's only 4:30.

171
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.210
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello, precious.

172
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.710
- And where have you been?
- Nowhere.

173
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.590
Hey, what's this?
It says Sarah Lawrence.

174
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.760
I got in!

175
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.060
Honey, that's great,

176
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.180
but isn't Sarah Lawrence
on the other side of the country?

177
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.600
Thus the basis of its appeal.

178
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.900
I thought we decided you were
going to stay here and go to school.

179
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.270
"U-Dub," like me. Be a Husky.

180
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.070
No, you decided.

181
00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.570
Oh, okay, so what, you just pick up
and leave, is that it?

182
00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.120
Let's hope so.

183
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.660
Ask Bianca who drove her home.

184
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.870
Kat, don't change the...
Drove? Who drove you home?

185
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.460
Now, don't get upset, Daddy,
but there's this boy...

186
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.290
- Who's a flaming imbecile.
- And I think he might ask me...

187
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.250
Please. I think I know
what he's going to ask you.

188
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.170
And I think I know the answer. No.
It's always no.

189
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.970
What are the two house rules?

190
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.470
Number one,
no dating till you graduate.

191
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.300
Number two,
no dating till you graduate.

192
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.310
- That's it.
- Daddy, that's so unfair.

193
00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.390
All right, you want to know
what's unfair? This is for you, too.

194
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.770
This morning I delivered a set of twins
to a 15-year-old girl.

195
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.400
Do you know what she said to me?

196
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.860
I'm a crack whore who should have

197
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.570
made my skeezy boyfriend
wear a condom?

198
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.820
Close, but no.

199
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.160
She said,
"I should have listened to my father."

200
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.790
- She did not.
- Well, that's what she would have said

201
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.910
if she wasn't so doped up.

202
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.250
Can we focus on me
for a second, please?

203
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.460
I am the only girl in school
who's not dating.

204
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.050
Oh, no, you're not.
Your sister doesn't date.

205
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.420
And I don't intend to.

206
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.130
And why is that again?

207
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.220
Have you seen the unwashed
miscreants that go to that school?

208
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.600
Where did you come from?
Planet Loser?

209
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.680
As opposed to
Planet Look At Me, Look At Me.

210
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.140
Okay, here's how we solve this one.

211
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.060
Old rule out. New rule, Bianca can date

212
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.110
when she does.

213
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.280
But she's a mutant!
What if she never dates?

214
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.740
Then you'll never date. Oh, I like that.

215
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.200
And I'll get to sleep at night.

216
00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:27.450
The deep slumber of a father

217
00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.040
whose daughters aren't out
being impregnated.

218
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.040
- We'll talk about Sarah Lawrence later.
- Fine.

219
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.050
- Wait! Daddy!
- Gotta go.

220
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.010
Can't you just find
some blind, deaf retard

221
00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.260
to take you to the movies
so I can have one date?

222
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.260
I'm sorry. Looks like
you'll just have to miss out

223
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.310
on the witty repartee
of Joey "Eat Me" Donner.

224
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.230
You suck.

225
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.910
Hi. Can we make this quick?

226
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.450
Roxanne Corinne and Andrew Jarrett
are having an incredibly horrendous

227
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.960
public break-up on the quad, again.

228
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.710
Oh, yeah, okay. I thought that we'd

229
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.130
start with pronunciation,
if that's all right with you.

230
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.630
Not the hacking and gagging
and spitting part, please.

231
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.300
Well, there is an alternative.

232
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.390
- There is?
- Yeah, French food.

233
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.350
We could eat some together

234
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.270
Saturday night?

235
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.820
You're asking me out?

236
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.990
That's so cute.
What's your name again?

237
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.240
Cameron. Listen, I know
that your dad doesn't let you date,

238
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.580
but I thought
that if it was for French class...

239
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.620
- Oh, wait a minute. Curtis...
- Cameron.

240
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.670
My dad just came up with a new rule.
I can date when my sister does.

241
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.330
You're kidding.
Let me ask you, do you like sailing?

242
00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.040
'Cause I read about this place
that rents boats...

243
00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.960
A beaucoup problemo, Calvin.

244
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:04.720
In case you haven't heard, my sister's
a particularly hideous breed of loser.

245
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.970
Yeah. Yeah, I noticed
she's a little antisocial.

246
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.020
- Why is that?
- Unsolved mystery.

247
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.600
She used to be really popular,
and then it was like

248
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.810
she got sick of it or something.

249
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.150
Theories abound as to why,

250
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.230
but I'm pretty sure she's just
incapable of human interaction.

251
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.240
Plus, she's a bitch.

252
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.120
Well, yeah, but I'm sure,
you know, that there are

253
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.160
lots of guys who wouldn't mind
going out with a difficult woman.

254
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.370
I mean, you know, people jump
out of airplanes and ski off cliffs.

255
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.670
It'd be like "Extreme Dating."

256
00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.800
You think you could find
someone that extreme?

257
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.670
Yeah, sure, why not?

258
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.050
- And you'd do that for me?
- Hell, yes!

259
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.390
I mean, you know, I could look into it.

260
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.110
Now, I have gathered a group of guys,
couldn't be more perfect.

261
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.730
Padua's finest.

262
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.030
Hi. How you doin'?

263
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.040
Would any of you be interested
in dating Katarina Stratford?

264
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.880
I've never been that ripped.

265
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.090
Maybe if we were
the last two people alive,

266
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.010
and there were no sheep.

267
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.220
Are there sheep?

268
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.520
Did I or did I not tell you
it was pointless?

269
00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.600
No one will go out with her.

270
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.070
Hey, hey, what about him?

271
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.530
Him? No, don't...
Don't look at him, okay?

272
00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:52.740
He's a criminal.
I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.

273
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:56.750
- He just did a year in San Quentin.
- Well, at least he's horny.

274
00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.500
I'm serious, man. He's whacked.

275
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.090
He sold his own liver on the
black market for a new set of speakers.

276
00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.850
He's our guy.

277
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.450
Hi. How you doin'?

278
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.660
Listen, I...

279
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.960
Okay. Later, then.

280
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.630
How do we get him to date Kat?

281
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.180
I don't know.

282
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.300
I mean, we could pay him,

283
00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.020
but we don't have any money.

284
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.640
Yeah, well, what we need is a backer.

285
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.480
- What's that?
- Someone with money who's stupid.

286
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.150
Oh, yeah.

287
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.500
Is that a peach Fruit Roll-Up?
Because you don't see many...

288
00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.420
Oh, okay. Yeah. All right.

289
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.800
- Are you lost?
- No.

290
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.840
Actually, I just came by to chat.

291
00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.380
- We don't chat.
- Well, actually, I thought

292
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.600
that I'd run an idea by you,
just to see if you're interested.

293
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.100
- I'm not.
- Well, hear me out.

294
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.180
Now, you want Bianca, right?

295
00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.980
But she can't go out with you
because her sister

296
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.900
is this insane head case, and no one
will go out with her, right?

297
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.820
Does this conversation
have a purpose?

298
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.900
What I think you need to do,

299
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.030
is you need to hire a guy
who'll go out with her.

300
00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.700
Someone who doesn't scare so easily.

301
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.210
That guy?

302
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.920
- I heard he ate a live duck once.
- Everything but the beak and feet.

303
00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.710
Clearly, he's a solid investment.

304
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.880
- What's in it for you?
- Hey.

305
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.930
I'm walking down the hall and
I say hello to you, you say hello to me.

306
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.060
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
You're cool by association.

307
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.520
I'll think about it.

308
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.110
- We're done now.
- Yeah.

309
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.530
What are you doing
getting him involved?

310
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:36.870
Relax, now. Relax.

311
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.870
We let him pretend
he's calling the shots.

312
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.910
While he's busy setting things up,
you have time with Bianca.

313
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.130
That is a good idea. All right.

314
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.260
I have a dick on my face, don't I?

315
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.220
Now, remember, guys,

316
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.720
grip it and rip it.

317
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.530
Hey. How you doin'?

318
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.160
I had some great duck last night.

319
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.960
Do I know you?

320
00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.630
You see that girl?

321
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.090
- Yeah.
- That's Kat Stratford.

322
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.430
I want you to go out with her.

323
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.720
Yeah, sure, Sparky.

324
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:45.600
Look, I can't take out her sister
until Kat starts dating.

325
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.440
You see, their dad's whacked out.
He's got this rule where the girls...

326
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.860
That's a touching story. It really is.
Not my problem.

327
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.440
Would you be willing
to make it your problem

328
00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.990
if I provide generous compensation?

329
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.620
You're gonna pay me
to take out some chick?

330
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.210
- How much?
- Twenty bucks.

331
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.840
Fine, 30.

332
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.680
Well, let's think about this.

333
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.680
We go to the movies, that's 15 bucks.

334
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.140
We get popcorn, that's 53.

335
00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.520
And she'll want Raisinets, right?

336
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.400
So, we're looking at 75 bucks.

337
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:41.450
This isn't a negotiation.
Take it or leave it, Trailer Park.

338
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.620
Fifty bucks and we got a deal, Fabio.

339
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.830
Great practice, everybody.

340
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.920
- Good hustle, Stratford.
- Thanks, Mr. Chapin.

341
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.970
Hey there, girlie. How you doin'?

342
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.640
Sweating like a pig, actually.
And yourself?

343
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.150
Now, there's a way to get
a guy's attention, huh?

344
00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:14.360
My mission in life.

345
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.150
But obviously, I struck your fancy,
so, you see, it worked.

346
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:18.900
The world makes sense again.

347
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.030
- Pick you up on Friday, then.
- Oh, right. Friday.

348
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.660
Well, the night I take you places
you've never been before.

349
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.960
Like where?
The 7-Eleven on Broadway?

350
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.710
Do you even know
my name, screw boy?

351
00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.960
I know a lot more than you think.

352
00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.000
Doubtful. Very doubtful.

353
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.390
We are screwed.

354
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.430
Hey, I don't want to hear
that defeatist attitude.

355
00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.560
- I want to hear you upbeat.
- We're screwed!

356
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.690
- There you go.
- Hey, Coach Chapin!

357
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.690
Run, Bogey!

358
00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.040
Have you ever considered a new look?

359
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.460
I mean, seriously. You could
have some definite potential

360
00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.620
buried under all this hostility.

361
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.420
I'm not hostile. I'm annoyed.

362
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.590
Why don't you try being nice?

363
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.510
People wouldn't know what to think.

364
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.760
You forget,
I don't care what people think.

365
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.220
Yes, you do.

366
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.100
No, I don't.

367
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.270
You don't always have to be
who they want you to be, you know.

368
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.350
I happen to like being adored,
thank you.

369
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:37.810
Where'd you get the pearls?

370
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.400
They're Mom's.

371
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.610
And you've been what,
hiding them for three years?

372
00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:44.900
No. Daddy found them
in a drawer last week.

373
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:46.950
So you're just gonna start
wearing them now?

374
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.990
It's not like she's coming back
to claim them!

375
00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.790
Besides, they look good on me.

376
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.880
Trust me. They don't.

377
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.840
Nice ride. Vintage fenders.

378
00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.300
Are you following me?

379
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.600
I was in the Laundromat.
I saw your car. I came over to say hi.

380
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.770
Hi.

381
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.900
- Not a big talker, huh?
- Depends on the topic.

382
00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.900
My fenders don't really whip me
into a verbal frenzy.

383
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.690
- You're not afraid of me, are you?
- Why would I be afraid of you?

384
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.280
- Well, most people are.
- Well, I'm not.

385
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.410
Well, maybe you're not afraid of me,

386
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.330
but I'm sure
you've thought about me naked.

387
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.700
Am I that transparent?

388
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.660
I want you, I need you.
Oh, baby, oh, baby.

389
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.430
What is it, asshole day?

390
00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.300
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

391
00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.610
You bitch!

392
00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.860
Whoops.

393
00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.700
"Whoops"?

394
00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.370
My insurance does not cover PMS!

395
00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:19.170
Well, then tell them I had a seizure.

396
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:20.330
Is this about Sarah Lawrence?

397
00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.590
Are you punishing me because
I want you to stay close to home?

398
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.380
Aren't you punishing me
because Mom left?

399
00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.380
You think you could
leave her out of this?

400
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.550
Fine.
Then stop making my decisions for me.

401
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.550
I'm your father. That's my right.

402
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.800
So what I want doesn't matter.

403
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.560
You're 18.
You don't know what you want.

404
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.890
And you won't know
what you want till you're 45,

405
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.310
and even if you get it,
you'll be too old to use it.

406
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.230
I want to go to an East Coast school!

407
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.900
I want you to trust me
to make my own choices,

408
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.780
and I want you to stop trying
to control my life

409
00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.440
just because you can't control yours!

410
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.660
Yeah? Well, you know what I want?

411
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.080
We'll continue this later.

412
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.540
Can't wait.

413
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.210
Did you just maim Joey's car?

414
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.290
Yeah. Looks like you're gonna
have to take the bus.

415
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.500
Has the fact
that you're completely psycho

416
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.880
managed to escape your attention?

417
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:10.300
Daddy!

418
00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.480
- When I shell out 50, I expect results.
- Yeah, I'm on it.

419
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.100
Watching that bitch violate my car
doesn't count as a date.

420
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.150
Now, if you don't get any,
I don't get any.

421
00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.570
So get some.

422
00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.740
I just upped my price.

423
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.950
- What?
- Hundred bucks a date.

424
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.870
- In advance.
- Forget it.

425
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.370
Well, forget her sister, then.

426
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:49.510
You better hope you're as smooth
as you think you are, Verona.

427
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:02.640
- Go.
- No, you go.

428
00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.270
I went before.

429
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.820
We know what you're trying to do
with Kat Stratford.

430
00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:18.990
Is that right?
What do you plan to do about it?

431
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.330
- Help you out.
- Why's that?

432
00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:24.500
The situation is,

433
00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:28.540
my man Cameron here
has a majorjones for Bianca Stratford.

434
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.960
What is it with this chick?
She have beer-flavored nipples?

435
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:35.640
- Hey!
- I... I think I speak correctly

436
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.350
when I say that Cameron's love is pure,

437
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.260
purer than, say, Joey Donner's.

438
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.600
I'm in this for the cash.
Donner can plow whoever he wants.

439
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.020
Okay, there will be no plowing.

440
00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:47.690
Patrick... Pat...

441
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.400
Let me explain something to you here.

442
00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.360
We set this whole thing up
so Cameron can get the girl. Cameron.

443
00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.240
Joey's just a pawn.

444
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.540
So, you two are gonna
help me tame the wild beast.

445
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.750
Absolutely.

446
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.830
We'll do some research,
we'll find out what she likes.

447
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.580
We're your guys.

448
00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.880
And he means that in
a strictly non-prison movie type of way.

449
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.970
Let's start here.

450
00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:18.720
Now, Friday night,
Bogey Lozenstein is having a party.

451
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.930
It's the perfect opportunity.

452
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.680
- Perfect opportunity for what?
- For you to take out Kat.

453
00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:28.400
I'll think about it.

454
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.400
And for a little payback.

455
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.610
This is gonna be some party.

456
00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.080
Let's do this.

457
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.560
Now, this is really important, okay?

458
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.190
Which one do you like better?

459
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:19.950
I think I like the white shirt better.

460
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.530
- Yeah, it's... It's more...
- Pensive?

461
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.410
Damn. I was going for thoughtful.

462
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.120
So, are you going to
Bogey Lozenbrau's thing

463
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:29.670
on Friday night?

464
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.420
Yeah, I might.

465
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:35.590
Good, 'cause you know, I'm not
gonna bother if you won't be there.

466
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.180
See you there.

467
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.970
- Okay.
- All right.

468
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:01.660
So, have you heard
about Bogey Lowenstein's party?

469
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.700
Yes, and I really, really,
really want to go.

470
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:09.410
But you know I can't.
Not unless my sister does.

471
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.920
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on that, but so far,

472
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.540
you know, she's not going for my guy.

473
00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.090
- She's not a...
- K.D. Lang fan? No.

474
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.720
I found a picture of Jared Leto
in her drawer once,

475
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.050
so I'm pretty sure she's not
harboring same-sex tendencies.

476
00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:28.140
Okay, so that's the kind of guys
she likes... Like, pretty guys.

477
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.850
I don't know. All I've ever heard her say

478
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.150
is that she'd die
before dating a guy that smokes.

479
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.400
Okay, all right, no smoking. What else?

480
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.400
You're asking me
to investigate the inner workings

481
00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.360
of my sister's twisted mind?

482
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.400
I don't think so.

483
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.200
Well, nothing else has worked.

484
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.030
We need to go
behind enemy lines here.

485
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.410
Okay, here we go.

486
00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.840
Class schedule, reading list,

487
00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.460
date book, concert tickets,
concert tickets.

488
00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.260
Black panties!

489
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:09.310
What does that tell us?

490
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.890
She wants to have sex someday,
that's what.

491
00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.310
You... She could just like the color.

492
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.440
You don't buy black lingerie
unless you want someone to see it.

493
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.860
So... Can I see your room?

494
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.450
No.

495
00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.410
A girl's room is very personal.

496
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:34.960
Oh, okay.

497
00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:48.930
- Nice bike.
- Yeah, you think so?

498
00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.240
Wow. Is this what a bar looks like?

499
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.950
Don't touch anything.
You may get hepatitis.

500
00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.880
So, what have you got for me?

501
00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:27.550
A little insight
into a very complicated girl.

502
00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:31.220
Excuse me.
Just one question before we start.

503
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:34.310
Should you be drinking alcohol
when you don't have a liver?

504
00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:36.390
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

505
00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:42.150
All right, first thing. Kat hates smokers.

506
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.820
So, you're telling me I'm a non-smoker.

507
00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:53.290
- Yes. Well, just for now.
- And here's another problem.

508
00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:57.040
Bianca said that Kat likes pretty guys.

509
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.670
Are you telling me I'm not a pretty guy?

510
00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.010
He's very pretty!

511
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:11.850
- This is a gorgeous guy.
- I just wasn't sure. I didn't know.

512
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.980
All right. Yeah, okay. Here's this.

513
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.350
"Likes.

514
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:24.820
"Thai food, feminist prose
and angry girl music

515
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.240
"of the indie rock persuasion."

516
00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.030
Here's a list of CDs
she has in her room.

517
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.700
So, I'm supposed to buy her
some noodles and a book

518
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:37.580
and sit around listening to chicks
who can't play their instruments, right?

519
00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.080
Have you ever been to Club Skunk?

520
00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.880
Her favorite band's
playing there tomorrow night.

521
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.210
I can't be seen at Club Skunk, all right?

522
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.050
But she'll be there. She's got tickets.

523
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.470
Assail your ears for one night.

524
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:55.140
She has a pair of black underwear.

525
00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.390
If that helps.

526
00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.730
Couldn't hurt, right?

527
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.470
Verona! What are you doing here?

528
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.890
I need agua!

529
00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.690
Two waters.

530
00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:40.330
If you're planning on asking me out,
you might as well just get it over with.

531
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:43.830
Do you mind?
You're kind of ruining this for me.

532
00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.290
You're not surrounded by
your usual cloud of smoke.

533
00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.340
I know. I quit.
Apparently they're bad for you.

534
00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.800
You think?

535
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:55.840
You know, these guys
are no Bikini Kill or the Raincoats.

536
00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:57.930
But they're not bad.

537
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.940
- You know who the Raincoats are?
- Why, don't you?

538
00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:10.770
I was watching you out there before.
I've never seen you look so sexy.

539
00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.580
- Come to Bogey's party with me.
- You never give up, do you?

540
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:28.000
Was that a yes?

541
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.380
- No.
- Well, then, was that a no?

542
00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.550
- No.
- I'll see you at 9:30 then!

543
00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.810
Should have used the window.

544
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.230
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.

545
00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.530
Where are we going?

546
00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:57.070
Well, if you must know,
a small study group of friends.

547
00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.410
Otherwise known as an orgy?

548
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.740
Mr. Stratford, it's just a party.

549
00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:03.870
And hell is just a sauna.

550
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:07.250
Do you know anything about a party?

551
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:11.170
- People expect me to be there.
- Kat's not going, you're not going.

552
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:13.590
Why can't you be normal?

553
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:16.420
- Define "normal."
- Bogey Lozenstein's party is normal.

554
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:19.090
- What's a Bogey Lozenstein?
- Bogey's party is just a lame excuse

555
00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.890
for all the idiots at our school
to drink beer

556
00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:22.350
and rub up against each other

557
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:24.560
in hopes of distracting themselves
from the pathetic emptiness

558
00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.720
of their meaningless...

559
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.600
- Meaningless, consumer-driven lives.
- Meaningless, consumer-driven lives.

560
00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.310
Can you, forjust one night,

561
00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.860
forget that you're completely wretched
and be my sister?

562
00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:39.320
Please?

563
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:45.080
Come on, Kat. Please do this for me.

564
00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.330
Fine. I'll make an appearance.

565
00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.170
- It's starting.
- It's just a party, Daddy.

566
00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.430
I want you to wear the belly.

567
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.140
Daddy, no.

568
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.270
Not all night.

569
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:10.230
Just around the living room for a minute
so you can understand

570
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:12.940
the full weight of your decisions.

571
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.150
- I am perfectly aware...
- Listen to me.

572
00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.570
Every time you even think
about kissing a boy,

573
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.360
I want you to picture wearing this
under your halter top.

574
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:24.530
You are so completely unbalanced.

575
00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.490
- We're going now.
- All right, wait a minute.

576
00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:29.750
No drinking, no drugs, no kissing,

577
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:34.040
no tattoos, no piercings,
no ritual animal slaughters of any kind.

578
00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.340
Oh, God, I'm giving them ideas.

579
00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.050
Daddy!

580
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.680
- What are you doing here?
- 9:30, right?

581
00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:45.180
- Oh, I'm early.
- Whatever. I'm driving.

582
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:48.350
Who knocked up your sister?

583
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.900
So then, Bianca says that I was right,

584
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.650
that she didn't wear the Kenneth Coles
with that dress

585
00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.360
because she thought that it was
mixing genres, right?

586
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:04.320
And the fact that I noticed,
and this is a direct quote, listen,

587
00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:06.700
"Really meant something."

588
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.040
You told me that part already.

589
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.000
I've been thinking about her
all the time.

590
00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.630
Stop being so self-involved
for one minute. How do I look?

591
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.130
You look like my Great Uncle Milton.

592
00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.590
- You think I should lose the tie?
- Yeah.

593
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.260
Maybe you're right. I'm just so nervous.

594
00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.220
And I'm also very excited.
I'm nervous, I'm excited.

595
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.180
It's all very mixed up.
I don't know what to do!

596
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:31.980
All right, just calm down, all right?

597
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.310
The last party I went to
was at Chuck E. Cheese.

598
00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.270
You want to talk about some fun.
That's a good time.

599
00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.930
Now, remember, guys.
Don't touch anything.

600
00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:10.930
What did I tell you?

601
00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.310
Must be Nigel with the Brie.

602
00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.090
You know, I'm...
I'm thinking of getting a Tercel.

603
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.180
Yeah, that's a Toyota.

604
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:53.470
It has dual side air bags
and a spacious back seat.

605
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:02.570
- Kiss me!
- Kiss him.

606
00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:04.110
- Okay.
- Good.

607
00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.410
Hey, thanks, man!

608
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:14.660
Sweet.

609
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.080
Looking fresh tonight, pussycat.

610
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:21.880
Wait. Was that...
Did your hairline just recede?

611
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.300
- Hey, where are you goin'?
- Away.

612
00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.180
- Your sister here?
- Stay away from my sister.

613
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.890
Oh, I'll stay away from your sister.

614
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:33.350
But I can't guarantee
she'll stay away from me.

615
00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:37.680
- Fight!
- Fight!

616
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.240
You guys, please! Take it outside!

617
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.740
Thank you!

618
00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.870
Hey, Kat. Look who found me.

619
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:04.590
- Bianca, wait.
- Please do not address me in public.

620
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:05.880
No, there's something I need to tell you.

621
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.300
I am busy enjoying my adolescence,
so scamper off and do the same.

622
00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.550
Bu-bye.

623
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.350
Want one?

624
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.680
- What is this?
- Right on, sister!

625
00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.060
I've been looking
all over the place for you.

626
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.860
I'm getting trashed, man. Isn't that
what you're supposed to do at a party?

627
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.240
I don't know.
I say do what you want to do.

628
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.320
Funny. You're the only one.

629
00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:31.910
Later.

630
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:47.170
Lord of the dance! Hi, Heather.

631
00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:50.090
- Bite me.
- Should've kept the tie.

632
00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.130
Hey. Hey, have you seen her
around anywhere?

633
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.390
- Relax.
- Relax? I'm fine.

634
00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.060
Follow the love.

635
00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:02.520
Hi, Bianca.

636
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.150
Oh, hi, Cameron.

637
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:09.480
You know Chastity?

638
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.780
Yeah. I think
we have art together, right?

639
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.030
Neat.

640
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:18.950
So, you...

641
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.580
You really look amazing.

642
00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.790
- Thanks.
- And we all know I look amazing.

643
00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.420
Yeah.

644
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:32.340
Bianca, let's go. We're all
congregating around Mr. Cuervo.

645
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:35.090
I'll see you around, okay?

646
00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.900
So, I've got
the Sears catalog thing going,

647
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:53.240
and the tube sock gig,
that is gonna be huge.

648
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.490
And I'm up for
a hemorrhoid cream ad next week.

649
00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.080
I know it sounds kind of bogus, but...

650
00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.200
I get to do some acting.

651
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.800
You see what I did there?

652
00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:18.220
That was underwear. I'll show you
the bathing suit one again.

653
00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.100
You see the difference?

654
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:26.690
All right, I'll show you guys.

655
00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.220
Is it me, or does this party
all of a sudden suck?

656
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.150
Really, really,

657
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:10.650
thank you!

658
00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:14.110
Hey. Hey, Kat, why don't you
let me have this one, huh?

659
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:15.990
No! This one's mine.

660
00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:20.070
My man! How did you get her to do it?

661
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.870
- Do what?
- Act like a human.

662
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.910
Yeah! All right!

663
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:27.790
Go!

664
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.920
See this?

665
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.200
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

666
00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:13.130
You're not fine. Come on.

667
00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.130
I just need to lie down.

668
00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:18.510
You lie down and you'll go to sleep.

669
00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.260
- Sleep is good.
- Not if you have a concussion.

670
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.430
Come on. Here, sit down.

671
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.310
- Sit.
- Hey, hey, we need to talk.

672
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:30.980
- I'm a little busy right now.
- Can you give me a second?

673
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.440
- What?
- It's off, okay? The whole thing's off.

674
00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:39.610
What are you talking about?

675
00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.360
She never wanted me.
She wanted Joey the whole time.

676
00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:45.620
Cameron, do you like the girl?

677
00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.000
- Yeah.
- And is she worth all this trouble?

678
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.000
I thought she was, but, you know, I...

679
00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.000
Well, she is or she isn't.

680
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.670
See, first of all,
Joey is not half the man you are.

681
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.670
Secondly, don't let anyone
ever make you feel

682
00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.380
like you don't deserve what you want.

683
00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:02.300
Go for it!

684
00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.810
- Come on.
- Why?

685
00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:19.780
This is so patronizing.

686
00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.450
Leave it to you to use
big words when you're smashed.

687
00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:25.530
- I don't think so.
- Kat.

688
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.450
- Why are you doing this?
- I told you. You may have a concussion.

689
00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.080
You don't care if I never wake up.

690
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.210
- Sure I do.
- Why?

691
00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:37.380
Because then I'd have to start
taking out girls who actually like me.

692
00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.590
- Like you could find one.
- Oh, see? That, there.

693
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:41.760
Who needs affection
when I have blind hatred?

694
00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:45.300
- I just... Let me sit down for a while.
- All right. There.

695
00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:02.820
- So, why'd you let him get to you?
- Who?

696
00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.110
- Joey.
- I hate him.

697
00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.870
Well, you've chosen the perfect
revenge, mainlining tequila.

698
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:15.710
- Well, you know what they say.
- Nope. What do they say?

699
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.130
No, no, no, no. Kat, come on, wake up!
Look at me!

700
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:23.210
Listen to me, Kat! Open your eyes!

701
00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:30.260
Hey.

702
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:33.430
Your eyes have a little green in them.

703
00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:52.870
I don't know if we should go.

704
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:55.870
Hey, a bunch of us
are going to Jarrett's. Ready?

705
00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.460
I have to be home in 20 minutes.

706
00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:01.880
Well, you know I don't have to be home
till 2:00, so...

707
00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:05.920
- One more chance.
- Man, I can't.

708
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:08.180
- Damn.
- That's a shame.

709
00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:11.470
- You wanna go?
- Sure.

710
00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.640
- Chastity!
- Hey, you passed.

711
00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:15.930
Bitch.

712
00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:23.020
- Hey. Have fun tonight?
- Tons.

713
00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:26.280
Hey, Cameron?

714
00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.620
Do you think you could
give me a ride home?

715
00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.830
I should do this.

716
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:37.620
- Do what?
- This!

717
00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:41.670
- Start a band?
- No, install car stereos.

718
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:45.340
Yeah, start a band.
My father would love that.

719
00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:02.690
You don't strike me as the type that
would ask your father for permission.

720
00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:06.190
- Oh, so now you think you know me?
- I'm getting there.

721
00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:09.700
The only thing people know
about me is that I'm scary.

722
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:13.700
Yeah, well, I'm no picnic myself.

723
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:25.710
So what's up with your dad?
Is he... Is he a pain in the ass?

724
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.170
No, he just wants me to be
somebody that I'm not.

725
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:29.970
- Who?
- Bianca.

726
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:31.470
Oh, Bianca.

727
00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:38.270
No offense or anything... I mean
I know everyone "digs" your sister,

728
00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:41.060
but she's without.

729
00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:49.820
You know,

730
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:54.660
you're not as vile
as I thought you were.

731
00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:08.000
Maybe we should do this another time.

732
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:55.680
You never wanted
to go sailing with me, did you?

733
00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.470
Yes, I did.

734
00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:01.350
No, you didn't.

735
00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.730
Okay, no, not actually...

736
00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:08.520
Well, then that's all you had to say.

737
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:13.190
Have you always been this selfish?

738
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.700
Yes.

739
00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:22.950
You know, just 'cause you're beautiful,

740
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:27.210
that doesn't mean that you can
treat people like they don't matter.

741
00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:30.290
I mean, I really liked you, okay.

742
00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:33.210
I defended you
when people called you conceited,

743
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.380
I helped you when you asked me to,

744
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:39.640
I learned French for you and then
you just blow me off so you could...

745
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.040
And I'm back in the game!

746
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:19.800
Kat, me lady.
You szay to the rhythm of me heart.

747
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.800
Dance for me, cozgirl.

748
00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:25.180
Kat, babe, what do we oze you
for the table dance?

749
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:28.770
All right, not that I give a damn,
but how was everybody's weekend?

750
00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:31.650
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe we should ask Kat.

751
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:34.360
Unless she kicked the crap
out of your dumb butt,

752
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.400
I don't wanna hear about it.

753
00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:41.240
Okay, let's open up our books
to page 73, Sonnet 141.

754
00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:42.780
And listen up.

755
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:44.830
"In faith, I do not love thee
with mine eyes

756
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:47.040
"For they in thee
a thousand errors note

757
00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.250
"But 'tis my heart that loves
what they despise

758
00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:52.170
"Who, in despite of view,
is pleas'd to dote"

759
00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:56.960
Now, I know Shakespeare's
a dead white guy,

760
00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:59.590
but he knozs his shit,
so we can overlook that.

761
00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.430
I want you all to write
your own version of this sonnet.

762
00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:07.890
Yes, Miss I-Have-An-Opinion-
About-Everything?

763
00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:10.690
Do you want this in iambic pentameter?

764
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.230
You're not gonna fight me on this?

765
00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.070
No, I think
it's a really good assignment.

766
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:18.400
You're just
messin' with me, aren't you?

767
00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:21.320
No, I'm really looking forward
to writing it.

768
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:22.660
Get out of my class.

769
00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:25.080
- What?
- Out. Get out!

770
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.290
- Thanks, Mr. Morgan.
- Shut up.

771
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:00.900
Hey. Cool picture.

772
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:04.660
What's that collar for? Is that
to keep him from licking his stitches?

773
00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:12.370
Kidding. No, because I know
you're a fan of Shakespeare.

774
00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:15.750
More than a fan. We're involved.

775
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:17.880
Okay.

776
00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:22.510
"Who could refrain
That had a heart to love

777
00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:26.850
- "and in that heart..."
- "Courage to make love known."

778
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.140
- That's Macbeth, right?
- Right.

779
00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:35.480
So, listen, I... I have this friend,

780
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:38.520
and he likes your friend...

781
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:47.740
What did you do to her?

782
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.120
I didn't do anything. She would've been
too drunk to remember.

783
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.000
But the plan was working.

784
00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.870
What do you care?
I thought you wanted out.

785
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:57.670
Yeah, well, I did, but

786
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:59.880
that was until she kissed me.

787
00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:03.340
- Where?
- In the car.

788
00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.850
Sorry.

789
00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:09.760
- Dweeb! Putz!
- I'm sorry.

790
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:11.770
All right, I talked to her.

791
00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:13.100
- I got the scoop.
- What'd she say?

792
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:15.640
"Hates him with the fire
of a thousand suns."

793
00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:17.560
That's a direct quote.

794
00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:21.230
Thanks, Michael.
That's very comforting of you.

795
00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:25.150
We don't know.
She could need a day to cool off.

796
00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.410
Maybe two.

797
00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.380
Hey!

798
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:48.260
Can you imagine who would go
to that antiquated mating ritual?

799
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:50.810
I would, but I don't have a date.

800
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:52.600
Do you really want
to get all dressed up,

801
00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:56.100
so some Drakkar Noir-wearing dexter
with a boner can feel you up

802
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:59.400
while you're forced to listen
to a band that by definition blozs?

803
00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.400
All right, all right, we won't go.

804
00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.070
It's not like I've got a dress anyway.

805
00:59:04.530 --> 00:59:06.990
You're looking at this
from entirely the wrong perspective.

806
00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:08.570
We're making a statement.

807
00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:12.080
Oh, goody.
Something new and different for us.

808
00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:32.810
- Hey there, Cupid.
- Hi, Joey.

809
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:36.600
You're concentrating awfully hard
considering it's gym class.

810
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:40.650
- Can I help you?
- I want to talk to you about prom.

811
00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.280
Look, you know the deal.
I can't go if Kat doesn't go.

812
00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.280
Your sister is going.

813
00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:56.450
- Since when?
- Let's just say I'm taking care of it.

814
01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:05.000
This should take care of the
flozers, the limo, the tux, everything.

815
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:07.550
Just make sure she gets to the prom.

816
01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:11.220
Do you know what?
I'm sick of playing your little game.

817
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.140
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

818
01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:16.640
You sick of, let's say, 300?

819
01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:41.310
Excuse me. Have you
seen The Feminine Mystique?

820
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:42.520
I've lost my copy.

821
01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.690
- What are you doing here?
- I heard there was a poetry reading.

822
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:47.690
- You're so...
- Charming.

823
01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:50.400
Wholesome.

824
01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:51.990
Unwelcome.

825
01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:57.070
You're not as mean as you think
you are, you know that?

826
01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.580
And you're not as badass
as you think you are.

827
01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:02.000
Someone still has her panties in a twist.

828
01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.330
Don't for one minute think that you had
any effect whatsoever on my panties.

829
01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.880
Then what did I have an effect on?

830
01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.750
Other than my upchuck reflex, nothing.

831
01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:24.440
You're right, she's still pissed.

832
01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.560
"Sweet love, renew thy force"

833
01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:30.610
Hey! Don't say shit like that to me.
People can hear you.

834
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:32.570
Look, you embarrassed the girl.

835
01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:36.280
Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity
and even the score.

836
01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.620
Listen, don't say shit like that to him.

837
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:44.790
People can hear you.

838
01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:19.110
You're just too good to be true

839
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.990
Can't take my eyes off of you

840
01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.040
You'd be like heaven to touch

841
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:29.630
I wanna hold you so much

842
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:33.880
At long last love has arrived

843
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:37.630
And I thank God I'm alive

844
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:41.430
You're just too good to be true

845
01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:46.140
Can't take my eyes off of you

846
01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.830
I love you, baby

847
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:09.750
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby

848
01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:14.040
To warm the lonely night
I love you, baby

849
01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:18.510
Trust in me when I say

850
01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:21.140
Oh, pretty baby

851
01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:25.010
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby

852
01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:30.350
Now that I found you, stay
and let me love you, baby

853
01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:35.230
Let me love you

854
01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.950
You look pretty nervous.

855
01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.570
Yes, sir.

856
01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.740
You're szeating like a pig.

857
01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:29.910
Yes, sir.

858
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.410
Your eyes are all bloodshot.

859
01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.080
Yes, sir.

860
01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:37.540
You've got pot, don't you?

861
01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.720
I'm confiscating this.

862
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:56.650
This, too.

863
01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.150
Mr. Chapin, can I talk to you
for a second?

864
01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.820
What can I do for you, Stratford?

865
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:08.830
I have some ideas on how
we can improve the girls' soccer team.

866
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:11.250
Great! Let's talk about it later.

867
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.340
The window.

868
01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:23.760
As you know, we have
a really big game with Hillcrest High...

869
01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.340
Your bicep is huge!

870
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:28.100
Oh, my God.
The other one's even bigger.

871
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:30.760
You don't take steroids, do you,
because I've heard steroids

872
01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:33.430
can severely disintegrate
your package?

873
01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.350
Not that I'm thinking about
your package.

874
01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.560
- That's not the point.
- Let's hope not.

875
01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:42.360
The point is they kick our butts
every year.

876
01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:47.070
I was thinking, I devised a plan that
will enable us to finally defeat them.

877
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.620
Which is?

878
01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:51.950
- That thing that you taught us.
- What thing?

879
01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:54.290
- Misdirection.
- I taught you that?

880
01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:58.130
Yeah, you or Siegfried or Roy?
Anyway, that's not important.

881
01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:00.880
The... Think about it.

882
01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:03.630
They're looking left
and we're running right.

883
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.800
Bang, we score. We win.

884
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:08.640
Okay, but how do we get 'em
to look left?

885
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:11.970
Like this.

886
01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.820
Okay. Well,

887
01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:25.490
now that you've seen "the plan,"

888
01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:30.070
I'm gonna go and show "the plan"
to someone else.

889
01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.240
Okay.

890
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.120
Hi.

891
01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.340
I can't thank you enough
for helping me sneak out of detention.

892
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:48.340
- Very cool.
- No problem.

893
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:51.680
I thought for sure I was busted when I
was climbing out that window, I tell ya.

894
01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.100
So, how did you keep him distracted?

895
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.930
I dazzled him with my wits.

896
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:03.020
- So, what's your excuse?
- For?

897
01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.320
For acting the way we do?

898
01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.610
I don't like to do what people expect.

899
01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.870
Why should I live up to other people's
expectations instead of my own?

900
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:15.290
So, you disappoint 'em from the start
and then you're covered, right?

901
01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.540
Something like that.

902
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:22.380
- Then you screzed up.
- How?

903
01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:26.210
You never disappointed me.

904
01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:36.560
Are you up for it?

905
01:08:37.230 --> 01:08:38.730
Up for what?

906
01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:03.560
All right, come on.

907
01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:20.660
No, none of that stuff is true.

908
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:24.160
- State trooper.
- Fallacy. Dead guy in the parking lot?

909
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:26.170
Rumor. The duck?

910
01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:28.500
Hearsay. Bobby Ridgezay's balls?

911
01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.340
Fact. But he deserved it.
He tried to grope me in the lunch line.

912
01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.470
- Fair enough.
- The accent?

913
01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.340
It's real.
I lived in Australia until I was 10.

914
01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.470
- With the Pygmies?
- Close.

915
01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.180
With my mom.

916
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:47.020
Where were you last year?
I know the porn career is a lie.

917
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.440
Do you?

918
01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.490
- Tell me something true.
- Something true.

919
01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.000
I hate peas.

920
01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:08.130
No. Something real.
Something no one else knozs.

921
01:11:08.290 --> 01:11:10.710
Okay. You're szeet,

922
01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.880
and sexy,

923
01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.720
and completely hot for me.

924
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:23.140
You are amazingly self-assured.
Has anyone ever told you that?

925
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:26.060
I tell myself that every day, actually.

926
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:32.980
- Go to the prom with me.
- Is that a request or a command?

927
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:35.240
Come on. Go with me.

928
01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:38.740
- No.
- No? Why not?

929
01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.240
Because I don't want to.
Because it's a stupid tradition.

930
01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:44.080
Come on.
People won't expect you to go.

931
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:47.040
Why are you pushing this?

932
01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:51.210
What's in it for you?

933
01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:58.340
So now I need to have a motive
to want to be with you?

934
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:59.930
You tell me.

935
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.430
You need therapy, you know that?

936
01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.060
Has anyone ever told you that?

937
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.770
- Anszer the question, Patrick.
- Nothing!

938
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:09.850
There is nothing in it for me,

939
01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:12.520
just the pleasure of your company.
Okay?

940
01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.380
Wait. Wait a minute.
That... That's not on this page.

941
01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:21.170
Seven!

942
01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.350
Good.

943
01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.980
- Daddy?
- Hi, honey.

944
01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:37.270
I'd like to discuss tomorrow night
with you. As you know, it's the prom...

945
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:45.530
The prom? Kat has a date?

946
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:47.870
Well, no.

947
01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.290
Don't think you're fooling me.

948
01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:51.710
I know who you wanna
bend the rules for.

949
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:53.710
It's that hot-rod Joey.

950
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:55.460
What's a hot rod?

951
01:13:56.210 --> 01:14:00.630
It's a... If your sister's not going,
you're not going. End of story.

952
01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:03.380
Okay, let's review.

953
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:06.550
Kat, not interested, me, dying to go.

954
01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.890
Do you know what happens at proms?

955
01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:11.730
Yes, Daddy. We'll dance,
we'll kiss, we'll come home.

956
01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:14.310
It's not quite the crisis situation
you imagine.

957
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.480
Kissing, huh?
That's what you think happens?

958
01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.650
Got nezs for you.

959
01:14:17.730 --> 01:14:22.240
Kissing isn't what keeps me up to
my elbozs in placenta all day long.

960
01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:25.660
Can we for two seconds ignore the fact
that you're severely unhinged,

961
01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.240
and discuss my need for a night
of teenage normalcy?

962
01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:31.410
What's normal?
Those damn Dazson's River kids,

963
01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.250
sleeping in each other's beds
and whatnot?

964
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.000
- Daddy, that is so not...
- Got nezs for ya.

965
01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.750
I'm down. I've got the 4-1 -1.

966
01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:41.170
And you are not going out
and getting jiggy with some boy.

967
01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:43.760
I don't care how dope his ride is.

968
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.180
My mama didn't raise no fool.

969
01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.100
Thanks, Bill.

970
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:58.980
Ridiculous amounts of love
across this nation worldwide.

971
01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.610
Believe it.

972
01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:03.860
This is the true story.

973
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:06.610
Seattle.

974
01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.530
Come in.

975
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:18.460
Listen, I know...

976
01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:24.630
I know you hate having to sit at home
because I'm not Suzy High School.

977
01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.970
- Like you care.
- I do care.

978
01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:30.800
But I'm a firm believer in doing
something for your own reasons,

979
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:32.890
and not someone else's.

980
01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:35.810
Well, I wish I had that luxury.

981
01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:38.650
You know, I'm the only sophomore
that got asked to go to the prom,

982
01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:41.650
and I can't go
because you don't feel like it.

983
01:15:45.650 --> 01:15:48.910
Joey never told you
that we went out, did he?

984
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:52.490
- Yeah, okay.
- In ninth, for a month.

985
01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:02.460
- Why?
- Because he was, like, such a babe.

986
01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:06.300
- But you hate Joey.
- Now I do.

987
01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:08.680
So, what happened?

988
01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:17.930
Please tell me you're joking.

989
01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:21.440
Just once, right after Mom left.

990
01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:25.110
Everyone was doing it, so...

991
01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:26.530
I did it.

992
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:30.860
Afterwards I told him I didn't want to
anymore because I wasn't ready,

993
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:33.490
and he got pissed and he dumped me.

994
01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.540
After that I szore I'd never do anything

995
01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:38.460
just because everyone else
was doing it.

996
01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:40.210
And I haven't since,

997
01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:42.460
with the exception of Bogey's party

998
01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:45.170
and my stunning
digestive pyrotechnics.

999
01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:50.550
How is it possible
that I did not know about this?

1000
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:52.470
I warned him that if he told anyone,

1001
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:56.220
the cheerleading squad would find out
how tiny his dick is.

1002
01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:01.900
Okay, so why didn't you tell me?

1003
01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:06.820
I wanted to let you
make up your mind about him.

1004
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:11.030
Then why did you help Daddy
hold me hostage?

1005
01:17:11.410 --> 01:17:14.740
It's not like I'm stupid enough
to repeat your mistakes.

1006
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:16.740
I guess I thought I was protecting you.

1007
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:19.830
By not letting me experience
anything for myself?

1008
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:22.580
Not all experiences are good, Bianca.

1009
01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:24.670
You can't always trust
the people you want to.

1010
01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:27.340
Well, I guess I'll never know, will I?

1011
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:14.220
Ladies with thinning hair or bald spots,

1012
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:18.810
G.L.H. solves the problem instantly.
G.L.H. is not a paint or a cover-up.

1013
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:23.230
It's an amazing powder that clings
to the tiniest hairs on your head.

1014
01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:25.140
It actually builds on itself,

1015
01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:27.810
leaving you with great,
great-looking hair.

1016
01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:29.570
And the G.L.H. hair system
is not expensive.

1017
01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:30.730
Interesting.

1018
01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:33.240
Order your G.L.H. hair package now.

1019
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:36.240
Bye, Dad. I'm going to the prom.

1020
01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:37.990
Funny, szeetie.

1021
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:41.410
It instantly covers your bald spot
leaving you with great looking hair.

1022
01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.080
- What's that?
- A prom dress.

1023
01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:50.960
I seem to be hearing that word
a lot lately.

1024
01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.350
- Hi.
- Wow. I...

1025
01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.640
Wow.

1026
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:07.100
- Bye, Daddy.
- Stop.

1027
01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:09.980
Turn. Explain.

1028
01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:14.690
Okay. Remember how you said
I could date if Kat dated?

1029
01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.030
Well, she found this guy
who's actually kind of perfect for her

1030
01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.530
which is perfect for me,

1031
01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:21.450
because Cameron asked me to go to
the prom and I really, really wanna go,

1032
01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:24.700
and since Kat went, I guess I'm allozed
to, based on the aforementioned rule,

1033
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:26.870
and its previous stipulations, of course.

1034
01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:29.630
- Nice to meet you.
- Let's go.

1035
01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.720
I know every cop in town, bucko!

1036
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:40.800
This is not good.

1037
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:23.600
Wow.

1038
01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:26.430
You, too.

1039
01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.100
Where'd you get a tux
at the last minute?

1040
01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:34.360
Oh, just something I had,
you know, lying around.

1041
01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:35.940
Where'd you get the dress?

1042
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:38.610
Oh, just something I had,
you know, lying around.

1043
01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:46.040
Listen, I'm really sorry
that I questioned your motives.

1044
01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:48.250
I was wrong.

1045
01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.790
You're forgiven.

1046
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:55.750
Okay.

1047
01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.130
- Ready for the prom?
- Yes, ma'am.

1048
01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:16.480
Hi, Mr. Stratford. I'm Joey.
I'm here to pick up Bianca.

1049
01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:39.340
- Have you seen him?
- Who?

1050
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:42.130
William.
He asked me to meet him here.

1051
01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:44.760
Oh, Mandella,
please tell me you haven't

1052
01:21:44.850 --> 01:21:47.470
progressed to full-on hallucinations.

1053
01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.460
- Milady.
- Good sir.

1054
01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.730
Oh, my God, it's...

1055
01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.400
I called in a favor!

1056
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:41.290
What are you doing here?

1057
01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:43.880
I know you didn't think you were
the only sophomore at the prom.

1058
01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.800
Joey just picked me up.

1059
01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.890
Oh, well, congratulations.
He's all yours.

1060
01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:50.640
Very generous, princess.

1061
01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.890
And just so you know,
Joey only liked you for one reason.

1062
01:23:53.970 --> 01:23:55.890
He even had a bet going
with his friends.

1063
01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:58.140
He was gonna nail you tonight.

1064
01:24:03.150 --> 01:24:05.400
- Milwaukee.
- What?

1065
01:24:05.610 --> 01:24:08.650
That's where I was last year.
I wasn't in jail.

1066
01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.070
I don't know Marilyn Manson

1067
01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:13.780
and I didn't sleep with a Spice Girl,
I don't think.

1068
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:17.660
You see, my grandpa, he was ill
so I spent most of the year on his couch

1069
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:21.080
watching Wheel ofFortune
and making SpaghettiOs.

1070
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.290
End of story.

1071
01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.250
No way.

1072
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:31.300
Hey. What's Bianca doing here
with that cheese dick?

1073
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:36.350
I didn't pay you to take out Kat so some
little punk could snake me with Bianca.

1074
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:42.480
Nothing in it for you, huh?

1075
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:55.990
The shit hath hitteth

1076
01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.200
the faneth.

1077
01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:05.170
Joey, pal, compadre?

1078
01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:11.470
You messed with the wrong guy,
and now you're gonna pay.

1079
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:14.180
You and that little bitch.

1080
01:25:14.970 --> 01:25:18.390
All right, that's enough, okay!
You crossed the line.

1081
01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.730
Oh, come on! Get up, you little punk!

1082
01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:31.070
Shit, Bianca!
I'm shooting a nose spray ad tomorrow!

1083
01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.660
That's for making my date bleed!
That's for my sister!

1084
01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:37.490
And that's for me.

1085
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.540
Are you okay?

1086
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:49.260
Never been better.

1087
01:25:58.270 --> 01:25:59.310
Would you give me a chance...

1088
01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:02.600
You were paid to take me out
by the one person I truly hate.

1089
01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:04.730
I knew this was a set-up!

1090
01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:07.270
Kat, it wasn't like that, okay.

1091
01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:10.030
What was it like, a down payment now
and a bonus for sleeping with me?

1092
01:26:10.110 --> 01:26:13.070
No, I didn't care about the money!
I cared...

1093
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:15.740
I cared about you.

1094
01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.950
You are so not who I thought you were.

1095
01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:04.620
You want?

1096
01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:06.080
Thanks.

1097
01:27:07.330 --> 01:27:11.340
So, you sure you don't want
to go sailing with us? It'll be fun.

1098
01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.670
No, I'm fine.

1099
01:27:15.090 --> 01:27:19.180
Look, I don't know if I ever thanked you
for going last night,

1100
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:22.850
but it really meant a lot to me.

1101
01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:26.480
I'm glad.

1102
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:30.820
- Hey.
- Hey.

1103
01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:32.820
You ready?

1104
01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.150
- See you later.
- Bye.

1105
01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:40.660
- Is... Is she okay?
- I hope so.

1106
01:27:47.670 --> 01:27:49.540
Where's your sister going?

1107
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:53.500
She's meeting some bikers,
big ones, full of sperm.

1108
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:56.670
Funny.

1109
01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.680
So, tell me about this dance.
Was it hoppin'?

1110
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:03.970
Parts of it.

1111
01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:05.350
Which parts?

1112
01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:09.150
The part where Bianca
beat the hell out of some guy.

1113
01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:10.650
Bianca did what?

1114
01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:13.980
What's the matter,
upset that I rubbed off on her?

1115
01:28:14.730 --> 01:28:16.240
No, impressed.

1116
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:22.830
Fathers don't like to admit it
when their daughters

1117
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:24.240
are capable of running their own lives.

1118
01:28:24.330 --> 01:28:26.830
It means we've become spectators.

1119
01:28:30.670 --> 01:28:35.380
Bianca still lets me play a few innings.
You've had me on the bench for years.

1120
01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.180
And when you go to Sarah Lawrence,
I won't even be able to watch the game.

1121
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:44.930
When I go?

1122
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:49.100
Oh, boy. Don't tell me
you changed your mind.

1123
01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:52.270
I already sent 'em a check.

1124
01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:12.880
All right, I assume everyone
has found time to complete their poem,

1125
01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.790
except for Mr. Donner,

1126
01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:16.960
who has an excuse.

1127
01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:21.130
Shaft, lose the glasses.

1128
01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:28.390
All right, anyone brave enough
to read theirs aloud?

1129
01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:38.070
I will.

1130
01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:41.990
Lord, here we go.

1131
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:54.250
"I hate the way you talk to me
and the way you cut your hair

1132
01:29:54.330 --> 01:29:58.750
"I hate the way you drive my car
I hate it when you stare

1133
01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:02.720
"I hate your big dumb combat boots
and the way you read my mind

1134
01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:06.510
"I hate you so much it makes me sick
It even makes me rhyme

1135
01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:11.770
"I hate it...
I hate the way you're always right

1136
01:30:11.850 --> 01:30:13.980
"I hate it when you lie

1137
01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:18.150
"I hate it when you make me laugh
even worse when you make me cry

1138
01:30:19.690 --> 01:30:23.780
"I hate it when you're not around
and the fact that you didn't call

1139
01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:27.530
"But mostly, I hate the way
I don't hate you, not even close

1140
01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:30.240
"not even a little bit, not even at all"

1141
01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:16.460
- Nice, huh?
- A Fender Strat?

1142
01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:18.500
Is it for me?

1143
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:22.340
Yeah, I thought you could use it,
you know, when you start your band.

1144
01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:25.130
Besides,
I had some extra cash, you know.

1145
01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:28.720
Some asshole paid me
to take out this really great girl.

1146
01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:31.720
Is that right?

1147
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:35.730
Yeah, but I screzed up.
I... I fell for her.

1148
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:39.610
Really?

1149
01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:42.400
It's not every day you find a girl

1150
01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:45.780
who'll flash someone
to get you out of detention.

1151
01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:47.820
Oh, God.

1152
01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:59.830
You can't just buy me a guitar
every time you screw up, you know.

1153
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:01.670
Yeah, I know.

1154
01:32:02.630 --> 01:32:06.340
But there's always drums and bass
and maybe even one day a tambourine.

1155
01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:15.470
And don't just think you can...

1156
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:51.260
No offense. I know everyone "digs"
your sister and all,

1157
01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:53.010
but she's without.

1158
01:34:54.970 --> 01:34:58.930
You know, you're not as vile
as I thought you were.

1159
01:35:08.110 --> 01:35:10.820
You suck.

1160
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:14.610
Okay. Let's go!

1161
01:35:16.530 --> 01:35:18.530
You're just messin' with me,
aren't you?

1162
01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:20.700
No, I'm really looking forward
to doing it.

1163
01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:22.080
Go see Miss Perky.

1164
01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.830
- What?
- Go. Perky's. Go, now.

1165
01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:27.830
Once again.
"Perky, now" is the second one.

1166
01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:30.710
- Perky's now. Perky's, now.
- Right away.

1167
01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:32.550
- Now, Perky's.
- Hey, hey.

1168
01:35:32.670 --> 01:35:35.420
- Now, Perky's. Perky's now.
- At the beginning of the shot.

1169
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:36.880
Perk...

1170
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:43.720
Bianca, let's go. We're all
congregating around Mr. Cuervo.

1171
01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:47.230
I'll see you around, okay?

1172
01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:00.410
Don't worry. There's better for you,

1173
01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:02.370
and it's right here.

1174
01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:05.250
Come here.
No, I wanted you for so long.

1175
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:11.080
You messed with the wrong guy,
and now you're gonna pay.

1176
01:36:11.210 --> 01:36:13.500
You and that little bitch.

1177
01:36:14.670 --> 01:36:18.260
All right, that's enough, okay!
You crossed the line.

1178
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:24.600
What, are you kidding me?

1179
01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:33.770
- I'm driving, so I pick the tunes.
- And it's my car.

1180
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:39.610
I want some coffee!

1181
01:36:52.630 --> 01:36:55.460
Could I get a prophylactic?

1182
01:36:55.630 --> 01:36:57.420
A prophylactic.

1183
01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.680
- Let go!
- How could you set me up like that?

1184
01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.600
Oh, God, I just wanted...

1185
01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:06.720
To completely damage me,
send me to therapy forever?

1186
01:37:06.810 --> 01:37:09.230
- No, I just wanted...
- Ladies.

1187
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:13.940
Shall we go to my office?

1188
01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.780
Oh, my God!
