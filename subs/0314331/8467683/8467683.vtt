00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.758
Whenever I get gloomy
with the state of the world,

2
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:43.300
I think about the arrivals gate
at Heathrow airport.

3
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:44.841
General opinion
started to make out

4
00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:47.341
that we live in a world of
hatred and greed,

5
00:01:47.424 --> 00:01:48.925
but I don't see that.

6
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:51.424
Seems to me that
love is everywhere.

7
00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:54.675
Often it's not particularly
dignified or newsworthy,

8
00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:56.508
but it's always there.

9
00:01:56.591 --> 00:01:58.175
Fathers and sons,
mothers and daughters,

10
00:01:58.258 --> 00:01:59.466
husbands and wives,

11
00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.300
boyfriends, girlfriends,
old friends.

12
00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:04.800
When the planes
hit the Twin Towers,

13
00:02:04.883 --> 00:02:07.341
as far as I know, none of the phone calls
from the people on board

14
00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:10.050
were messages of
hate or revenge.

15
00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:12.341
They were all
messages of love.

16
00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:14.967
If you look for it,
I've got a sneaky feeling

17
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.633
you'll find that love
actually is all around.

18
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:37.258
<i>I feel it in my fingers</i>

19
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:40.591
<i>I feel it in my toes</i>

20
00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:45.424
<i>Feel it in my toes, yeah</i>

21
00:02:45.508 --> 00:02:49.925
<i>Love is all around me
and so the...</i>

22
00:02:50.508 --> 00:02:52.300
I'm afraid you
did it again, Bill.

23
00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:56.883
It's just, I know the old
version so well, you know.

24
00:02:57.383 --> 00:02:59.424
Well, we all do.

25
00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.050
That's why we're making
the new version.

26
00:03:02.175 --> 00:03:03.675
Right, okay, let's go.

27
00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:09.424
<i>I feel it in my fingers</i>

28
00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:10.549
<i>In my fingers</i>

29
00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:13.633
<i>I feel it in my toes</i>

30
00:03:13.883 --> 00:03:18.133
<i>Feel it in my toes, yeah</i>

31
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.300
<i>Love is all...</i>

32
00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:24.092
Fuck, wank, bugger,
shitting ass head and hole.

33
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.967
Start again.

34
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.300
<i>I feel it in my fingers</i>

35
00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:37.424
<i>In my fingers</i>

36
00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:40.424
<i>I feel it in my toes</i>

37
00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:45.175
<i>Feel it in my toes, yeah</i>

38
00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:47.424
<i>Christmas is all around me</i>

39
00:03:47.508 --> 00:03:48.549
<i>All around me</i>

40
00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:51.800
<i>And so the feeling grows</i>

41
00:03:51.883 --> 00:03:56.175
<i>So the feeling grows</i>

42
00:03:56.383 --> 00:03:58.841
<i>It's written in the wind</i>

43
00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:00.175
<i>In the wind</i>

44
00:04:00.258 --> 00:04:02.758
<i>It's everywhere I go</i>

45
00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:07.591
<i>Everywhere I go</i>

46
00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:10.092
<i>So if you
really love Christmas</i>

47
00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:11.217
<i>Love Christmas</i>

48
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.758
<i>Come on and let it snow</i>

49
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.008
<i>Come on and let it...</i>

50
00:04:16.092 --> 00:04:18.258
This is shit, isn't it?

51
00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.133
Yep,
solid gold shit, maestro.

52
00:04:45.217 --> 00:04:46.967
God, I'm so late.

53
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.383
It's just round the corner.
You'll make it.

54
00:04:49.466 --> 00:04:52.258
You sure you don't mind me
going without you?

55
00:04:52.341 --> 00:04:54.716
No, really.
I'm just feeling so rotten.

56
00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:56.217
I love you.

57
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.466
I know.

58
00:04:57.549 --> 00:05:01.383
I love you even when you're
sick and look disgusting.

59
00:05:01.883 --> 00:05:05.258
I know. Now, go or you
will actually miss it.

60
00:05:05.383 --> 00:05:07.092
Right.

61
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.466
Did I mention that I love you?

62
00:05:11.549 --> 00:05:14.383
Yes, you did.
Get out, loser.

63
00:05:31.466 --> 00:05:34.383
Karen, it's me again.

64
00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:38.633
I'm sorry, I literally don't have
anyone else to talk to.

65
00:05:39.716 --> 00:05:43.300
Absolutely. Horrible moment right now
though. Can I call you back?

66
00:05:43.383 --> 00:05:44.716
Of course.

67
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.549
Doesn't mean I'm not terribly concerned
that your wife just died.

68
00:05:49.092 --> 00:05:50.800
Understood.

69
00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:53.217
Bugger off, call me later.

70
00:05:57.258 --> 00:05:58.967
So what's this
big news then?

71
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.466
We've been given our parts
in the nativity play...

72
00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:03.508
and I'm the lobster.

73
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:05.175
- The lobster?
- Yeah.

74
00:06:05.508 --> 00:06:06.841
In the nativity play?

75
00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:08.675
Yeah. First lobster.

76
00:06:08.758 --> 00:06:12.508
There was more than one
lobster present at the birth of Jesus?

77
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:13.591
Duh.

78
00:06:19.133 --> 00:06:21.383
Best sandwiches in Britain.

79
00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:24.883
Try my lovely nuts?

80
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.675
Beautiful muffin
for a beautiful lady.

81
00:06:33.341 --> 00:06:35.424
Morning, my future wife.

82
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.758
Okay, you can stop there.
Thanks.

83
00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:58.716
I'm gonna need a couple
of orange gels, please, mate.

84
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.508
And by the way,
he introduced me as John,

85
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:01.967
but actually
everyone calls me Jack.

86
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.967
Fine. Nice to meet you, Jack.

87
00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.633
He got me right though.
I'm just Judy.

88
00:07:07.716 --> 00:07:09.466
Great, Just Judy!

89
00:07:14.758 --> 00:07:17.383
- No surprises?
- No surprises.

90
00:07:17.466 --> 00:07:19.383
Not like the stag night?

91
00:07:19.466 --> 00:07:21.258
Unlike the stag night.

92
00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:23.341
Do you admit the Brazilian
prostitutes were a mistake?

93
00:07:23.424 --> 00:07:24.841
I do.

94
00:07:24.967 --> 00:07:28.466
And it would've been much better
if they'd not turned out to be men?

95
00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:30.549
That is true.

96
00:07:33.008 --> 00:07:35.092
Good luck, kiddo.

97
00:07:58.133 --> 00:08:00.883
Prime Minister!

98
00:08:12.217 --> 00:08:14.217
Thank you.

99
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.258
Welcome, Prime Minister.

100
00:08:17.341 --> 00:08:20.008
I must work on my wave.

101
00:08:20.508 --> 00:08:21.549
How are you?

102
00:08:22.424 --> 00:08:24.633
How are you feeling?

103
00:08:24.716 --> 00:08:26.841
Cool. Powerful.

104
00:08:27.217 --> 00:08:29.633
Would you like to meet
your household staff?

105
00:08:29.758 --> 00:08:32.300
Yes, I would like
that very much indeed.

106
00:08:32.383 --> 00:08:35.383
Anything to put off
actually running the country.

107
00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:39.217
This is Terence.
He's in charge.

108
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.925
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

109
00:08:41.008 --> 00:08:42.883
I had an uncle
called Terence once.

110
00:08:42.967 --> 00:08:44.424
Hated him.
I think he was a pervert.

111
00:08:44.508 --> 00:08:47.050
But I very much
like the look of you.

112
00:08:47.424 --> 00:08:49.383
- This is Pat.
- Hello, Pat.

113
00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:52.008
Good morning, sir.
I'm the housekeeper.

114
00:08:52.092 --> 00:08:54.549
Right. It should be a lot easier with me
than with the last lot.

115
00:08:54.633 --> 00:08:57.508
No nappies, no teenagers,
no scary wife.

116
00:08:57.591 --> 00:09:00.508
And this is Natalie.
She's new, like you.

117
00:09:00.591 --> 00:09:02.591
- Hello, Natalie.
- Hello, David.

118
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.341
I mean, sir.

119
00:09:04.424 --> 00:09:06.549
Shit, I can't believe
I've just said that.

120
00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:10.424
And now I've gone and said shit.
Twice. I'm so sorry, sir.

121
00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.716
It's fine, it's fine.
You could've said fuck.

122
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.133
- And then we'd have been in real trouble.
- Thank you, sir.

123
00:09:15.217 --> 00:09:18.800
I did have an awful premonition
I was gonna fuck up on my first day.

124
00:09:19.633 --> 00:09:20.883
Oh, piss it!

125
00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:26.967
Right, I'll go get my things
and then let's fix the country, shall we?

126
00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:29.424
Yeah, I can't see why not.

127
00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:44.925
- It's all right.
- Did you see what I did?

128
00:09:45.008 --> 00:09:46.633
- Yes, I did.
- I just went...

129
00:09:47.258 --> 00:09:48.300
Hello, there.

130
00:09:48.383 --> 00:09:49.383
I'm right over here.

131
00:09:49.466 --> 00:09:52.424
Yeah, I'm in here.
Okay. Good. Thank you.

132
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:03.591
Oh, no.
That is so inconvenient.

133
00:10:07.092 --> 00:10:10.508
In the presence of God,
Peter and Juliet have given their consent

134
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:13.133
and made their marriage
vows to each other.

135
00:10:13.217 --> 00:10:16.508
They've declared their marriage
by the giving and receiving of rings.

136
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:20.508
I therefore proclaim that
they are husband and wife.

137
00:10:26.549 --> 00:10:29.175
And you resisted the
temptation for surprises.

138
00:10:29.258 --> 00:10:31.341
Yeah, I'm mature now.

139
00:10:41.549 --> 00:10:44.508
<i>Love, love, love</i>

140
00:10:45.883 --> 00:10:49.217
<i>Love, love, love</i>

141
00:10:51.383 --> 00:10:52.675
Did you do this?

142
00:10:54.424 --> 00:10:55.549
No.

143
00:10:55.633 --> 00:11:00.341
<i>Love, love, love, love</i>

144
00:11:02.424 --> 00:11:05.508
<i>There's nothing you can do
that can't be done</i>

145
00:11:05.591 --> 00:11:06.675
It...

146
00:11:06.758 --> 00:11:09.800
<i>There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung</i>

147
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.341
<i>There's nothing you can say
but you can learn how to play the game</i>

148
00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:18.800
<i>It's easy</i>

149
00:11:20.424 --> 00:11:22.508
<i>All you need is love</i>

150
00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:27.675
<i>All you need is love</i>

151
00:11:29.967 --> 00:11:33.967
<i>All you need is love, love</i>

152
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.175
<i>Love is all you need...</i>

153
00:11:39.591 --> 00:11:41.967
Look, it's Pikey.

154
00:11:53.133 --> 00:11:55.716
Hello! What the hell
are you doing here?

155
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.925
I just popped over
to borrow some old CDs.

156
00:11:59.008 --> 00:12:00.424
The lady of the house let
you in, did she?

157
00:12:00.508 --> 00:12:01.716
Yeah.

158
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.800
Lovely, obliging girl.

159
00:12:03.883 --> 00:12:05.008
Yeah.

160
00:12:05.092 --> 00:12:06.466
All right,
I just thought I'd pop back

161
00:12:06.549 --> 00:12:08.133
before the reception
and see if she's better.

162
00:12:08.217 --> 00:12:12.466
This is good.
Listen, I've been thinking.

163
00:12:13.383 --> 00:12:14.925
I think perhaps
we ought to take

164
00:12:15.008 --> 00:12:17.341
Mum out for her birthday on Friday.
What do you think?

165
00:12:17.424 --> 00:12:19.341
I just feel we've been
bad sons this year.

166
00:12:19.424 --> 00:12:22.258
Okay, sounds fine.
A bit boring but fine.

167
00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:23.800
Hurry up, big boy!

168
00:12:23.883 --> 00:12:27.633
I'm naked, and I want you at least twice
before Jamie gets home.

169
00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.967
I am so happy to see you!

170
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.758
A delicious delicacy?

171
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:45.217
No, thanks.

172
00:12:50.883 --> 00:12:53.092
Taste explosion?

173
00:13:05.258 --> 00:13:07.383
- Food?
- No, thanks.

174
00:13:07.508 --> 00:13:11.217
Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it?
Looks like a dead baby's finger.

175
00:13:13.217 --> 00:13:15.549
Tastes like it too.

176
00:13:19.508 --> 00:13:21.341
I'm Colin, by the way.

177
00:13:21.424 --> 00:13:23.883
- I'm Nancy.
- Wicked.

178
00:13:23.967 --> 00:13:26.424
- What do you do, Nancy?
- I'm a cook.

179
00:13:26.508 --> 00:13:28.341
- Ever do weddings?
- Yes, I do.

180
00:13:28.424 --> 00:13:30.300
They should've asked
you to do this one.

181
00:13:30.383 --> 00:13:31.633
They did.

182
00:13:32.466 --> 00:13:34.967
God, I wish you hadn't
have turned it down.

183
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.175
I didn't.

184
00:13:36.258 --> 00:13:38.424
Right.

185
00:13:41.092 --> 00:13:43.133
I've just worked out
why I can never find true love.

186
00:13:43.217 --> 00:13:44.258
Why is that?

187
00:13:44.341 --> 00:13:46.675
English girls.
They're stuck up, you see.

188
00:13:46.758 --> 00:13:48.925
And I am primarily
attractive to girls

189
00:13:49.008 --> 00:13:51.383
who are, you know,
cooler, game for a laugh.

190
00:13:51.466 --> 00:13:55.716
Like American girls.
So I should just go to America.

191
00:13:56.175 --> 00:13:58.217
I would get a girlfriend
there instantly.

192
00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.300
What do you think?

193
00:13:59.383 --> 00:14:01.341
I think it's crap, Colin.

194
00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:03.300
That's where you're wrong.

195
00:14:03.383 --> 00:14:06.508
American girls would seriously dig me
with my cute British accent.

196
00:14:06.591 --> 00:14:08.133
You don't have a cute
British accent.

197
00:14:08.217 --> 00:14:10.383
Yes, I do!
I'm going to America.

198
00:14:10.466 --> 00:14:14.258
Colin, you're a lonely, ugly asshole,
and you must accept it.

199
00:14:14.383 --> 00:14:17.300
Never.
I am Colin, God of Sex.

200
00:14:17.383 --> 00:14:19.383
I'm just on the wrong
continent, that's all.

201
00:14:19.466 --> 00:14:22.508
Bit of quiet while
we finish the lighting, guys!

202
00:14:23.175 --> 00:14:25.175
I thought I was never
gonna make it here today.

203
00:14:25.258 --> 00:14:26.967
- The traffic was just...
- Unbelievable.

204
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.258
Judy, could you take
the top off this time?

205
00:14:29.341 --> 00:14:31.217
Lighting and camera need to know
when we're actually gonna

206
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.633
see the nipples
and when we're not.

207
00:14:33.716 --> 00:14:37.466
Yes, okay. Right.
At least it's nice and warm in here.

208
00:14:37.549 --> 00:14:39.508
Yeah. It's not always
the case, is it?

209
00:14:39.633 --> 00:14:42.341
I was standing in for Brad Pitt once
on Seven Years in Tibet...

210
00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:44.925
- Yes, yeah.
- Bloody freezing.

211
00:14:45.591 --> 00:14:47.925
Sorry, guys, time's pretty tight
and we have to get the actors in.

212
00:14:48.008 --> 00:14:50.217
- Fine.
- I promise I won't look.

213
00:14:52.841 --> 00:14:55.925
Right, let's have another
look at that one, please.

214
00:15:08.133 --> 00:15:10.466
And Jerry says if you can just put
your hands on her breasts.

215
00:15:10.549 --> 00:15:11.675
All right, okay, yeah.
Is that all right?

216
00:15:11.758 --> 00:15:13.092
Yes. Yeah, fine.

217
00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:14.925
I'll warm them up.

218
00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:19.341
And massage them, please.

219
00:15:19.424 --> 00:15:20.508
Right.

220
00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:28.300
It's junction 13 that's
just murder, isn't it?

221
00:15:28.383 --> 00:15:30.758
Total gridlock this morning.

222
00:15:35.217 --> 00:15:39.675
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

223
00:15:40.092 --> 00:15:42.883
Some of her requests,
for instance,

224
00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:48.341
that I should bring Claudia Schiffer
as my date to the funeral,

225
00:15:48.424 --> 00:15:52.008
I was confident
she expected me to ignore.

226
00:15:52.092 --> 00:15:55.424
But others she was
pretty damn clear about.

227
00:15:56.549 --> 00:15:59.675
When she first mentioned
what's about to happen,

228
00:16:00.925 --> 00:16:03.424
I said,
over my dead body.

229
00:16:03.633 --> 00:16:06.633
And she said,
no, Daniel, over mine.

230
00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:09.925
And as usual,
my darling girl

231
00:16:11.591 --> 00:16:13.841
and Sam's
darling mom was right.

232
00:16:15.466 --> 00:16:20.383
So she's going to say her final farewell
to you not through me but,

233
00:16:20.549 --> 00:16:25.217
inevitably, ever so coolly,

234
00:16:26.841 --> 00:16:30.549
through the immortal genius of
the Bay City Rollers.

235
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.508
Do you love him?

236
00:17:31.675 --> 00:17:33.633
What?

237
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.217
No, I just thought I'd ask the blunt
question in case it was the right one

238
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.883
and you needed someone
to talk to about it

239
00:17:38.967 --> 00:17:40.008
and no one had
ever asked you,

240
00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:42.549
so you've never been able to talk
about it though you might've wanted to.

241
00:17:42.633 --> 00:17:46.925
No. No. No is the answer.
No. Absolutely not.

242
00:17:49.383 --> 00:17:51.341
So that's a no then?

243
00:17:51.424 --> 00:17:52.633
Yes.

244
00:17:58.341 --> 00:18:01.092
This DJ,
what do you reckon?

245
00:18:01.383 --> 00:18:04.133
- The worst in history?
- Probably.

246
00:18:04.466 --> 00:18:06.549
I think it all hangs
on the next song.

247
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:08.424
Now here's one
for the lovers.

248
00:18:08.508 --> 00:18:12.008
That's quite a few of you,
I shouldn't be surprised and a half.

249
00:18:19.175 --> 00:18:22.424
- He's done it, it's official.
- Worst DJ in the world.

250
00:18:31.925 --> 00:18:33.716
Sarah's waiting for you.

251
00:18:34.675 --> 00:18:37.341
Yes, of course.

252
00:18:38.008 --> 00:18:40.217
Great, good, good.

253
00:18:40.633 --> 00:18:42.341
How are you doing, Mia?

254
00:18:42.424 --> 00:18:44.466
Are you settling in fine?
Learning who to avoid?

255
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:46.258
Absolutely.

256
00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:50.008
Harry?

257
00:18:50.092 --> 00:18:54.466
Sarah, switch off your
phone and tell me exactly

258
00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:57.591
how long it is that
you've been working here.

259
00:19:00.383 --> 00:19:03.175
Two years, seven months,

260
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:05.967
three days and, I suppose,
what, two hours?

261
00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:10.883
And how long have you been in love with Karl,
our enigmatic chief designer?

262
00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:19.424
Two years,
seven months, three days

263
00:19:19.508 --> 00:19:22.300
and, I suppose,
an hour and 30 minutes.

264
00:19:22.383 --> 00:19:23.883
Thought as much.

265
00:19:23.967 --> 00:19:26.092
- Do you think everybody knows?
- Yes.

266
00:19:26.383 --> 00:19:28.258
- Do you think Karl knows?
- Yes.

267
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:32.591
That is...
That is bad news.

268
00:19:32.675 --> 00:19:36.258
I just thought that
maybe the time had come

269
00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:37.967
to do something about it.

270
00:19:38.967 --> 00:19:40.424
Like what?

271
00:19:40.508 --> 00:19:42.758
Invite him out for a drink,
and then after about 20 minutes,

272
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:45.341
casually drop into the conversation the fact
that you'd like to marry him

273
00:19:45.424 --> 00:19:46.466
and have lots of sex
and babies.

274
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:48.841
- You know that?
- Yes.

275
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:51.466
And so does Karl.

276
00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:54.549
Think about it,
for all our sakes.

277
00:19:55.217 --> 00:19:57.175
It's Christmas.

278
00:19:58.925 --> 00:20:03.591
Certainly. Excellent.
Will do. Thanks, boss.

279
00:20:06.591 --> 00:20:07.633
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi, Karl.

280
00:20:07.716 --> 00:20:08.841
Excuse me.

281
00:20:19.133 --> 00:20:22.424
Babe.
Absolutely, fire away.

282
00:20:23.466 --> 00:20:25.967
Mia, Mia, would
you turn that down?

283
00:20:27.925 --> 00:20:29.217
What is that?

284
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:33.217
And that was the Christmas effort
by the once great Billy Mack.

285
00:20:33.383 --> 00:20:36.175
Oh, dear me,
how are the mighty fallen.

286
00:20:36.383 --> 00:20:37.675
I can safely put
my hand up my ass and say

287
00:20:37.758 --> 00:20:41.466
that is the worst record
I've heard this century...

288
00:20:42.092 --> 00:20:46.133
And, coincidentally,
I believe Billy will be a guest

289
00:20:46.217 --> 00:20:48.841
on my friend Mike's show
in a few minutes' time.

290
00:20:49.591 --> 00:20:51.716
Welcome back, Bill.

291
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.341
So, Billy,
welcome back to the airwaves.

292
00:20:54.424 --> 00:20:57.591
New Christmas single,
cover of Love Is All Around.

293
00:20:57.675 --> 00:21:02.800
Except we've changed the word
love to Christmas.

294
00:21:03.008 --> 00:21:06.217
Yes, is that an important
message to you, Bill?

295
00:21:06.424 --> 00:21:08.508
Not really, Mike.

296
00:21:08.591 --> 00:21:13.133
Christmas is a time for people
with someone they love in their lives.

297
00:21:13.217 --> 00:21:15.549
- And that's not you?
- That's not me, Michael.

298
00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:19.633
When I was young and successful,
I was greedy and foolish,

299
00:21:19.716 --> 00:21:23.675
and now I'm left with no one,
wrinkled and alone.

300
00:21:24.133 --> 00:21:26.716
- Thanks for that, Bill.
- For what?

301
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.508
Well, for actually giving
a real answer to a question.

302
00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:33.258
It doesn't often happen here
at Radio Watford, I can tell you.

303
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:35.466
Ask me anything you like,
and I'll tell you the truth.

304
00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:37.300
Best shag you ever had?

305
00:21:37.383 --> 00:21:38.383
Britney Spears.

306
00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:42.092
No, only kidding!

307
00:21:42.175 --> 00:21:43.633
She was rubbish.

308
00:21:43.716 --> 00:21:45.092
Okay, here's one.

309
00:21:45.175 --> 00:21:49.549
How do you think the new record
compares to your old, classic stuff?

310
00:21:49.633 --> 00:21:53.217
Come on, Mikey, you know as well as
I do the record's crap.

311
00:21:55.175 --> 00:21:58.258
But wouldn't it be great
if number one this Christmas

312
00:21:58.341 --> 00:22:00.591
wasn't some smug teenager

313
00:22:00.675 --> 00:22:05.008
but an old ex-heroin addict
searching for a comeback at any price?

314
00:22:05.341 --> 00:22:07.424
All those young popsters
come Christmas day,

315
00:22:07.508 --> 00:22:11.341
they'll be stretched out naked
with a cute bird balancing on their balls

316
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:15.008
and I'll be stuck in some dingy flat
with me manager, Joe,

317
00:22:15.092 --> 00:22:17.092
ugliest man in the world,

318
00:22:17.424 --> 00:22:21.466
fucking miserable because
our fucking gamble didn't pay off.

319
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:26.591
So if you believe in Father Christmas,
children, like your Uncle Billy does,

320
00:22:27.175 --> 00:22:30.758
buy my festering turd of a record.

321
00:22:31.092 --> 00:22:34.050
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness

322
00:22:34.133 --> 00:22:38.258
of the moment when we try to squeeze
an extra syllable into the fourth line.

323
00:22:38.341 --> 00:22:40.675
I think you're referring to...

324
00:22:40.758 --> 00:22:43.383
If you really
love Christmas...

325
00:22:43.466 --> 00:22:45.341
Come on and let it snow.

326
00:22:46.508 --> 00:22:48.549
So, here it is one more time,

327
00:22:48.633 --> 00:22:52.050
the dark horse for this year's
Christmas number one,

328
00:22:52.217 --> 00:22:54.967
Christmas Is All Around.
Thank you, Billy.

329
00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.508
After this, the news.

330
00:22:56.591 --> 00:22:59.300
Is the new prime minister
in trouble already?

331
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.716
Okay. What's next?

332
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.050
The President's visit.

333
00:23:08.133 --> 00:23:11.633
Yes, yes. I fear this is going to
be a difficult one to play.

334
00:23:11.716 --> 00:23:12.841
Alex.

335
00:23:13.341 --> 00:23:15.633
There's a very strong feeling
in the party

336
00:23:15.716 --> 00:23:17.508
we mustn't allow ourselves
to be bullied

337
00:23:17.591 --> 00:23:18.883
from pillar to post
like the last government.

338
00:23:18.967 --> 00:23:20.050
Hear, hear.

339
00:23:20.133 --> 00:23:22.424
This is our first
really important test.

340
00:23:22.508 --> 00:23:24.175
Let's take a stand.

341
00:23:24.258 --> 00:23:29.133
Right. Right. I understand that,
but I have decided

342
00:23:30.424 --> 00:23:32.383
not to, not this time.

343
00:23:32.758 --> 00:23:34.383
We will, of course,
try to be clever.

344
00:23:34.466 --> 00:23:37.217
But let's not forget that America
is the most powerful country in the world.

345
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.675
I'm not going to act
like a petulant child.

346
00:23:42.008 --> 00:23:43.383
Right, who do you have
to screw around here

347
00:23:43.466 --> 00:23:45.633
to get a cup of tea
and a chocolate biscuit?

348
00:23:52.675 --> 00:23:53.800
Right.

349
00:23:56.217 --> 00:23:57.508
Yeah, come in.

350
00:24:02.466 --> 00:24:07.466
These have just come through
from the treasury and these are for you.

351
00:24:08.508 --> 00:24:10.300
Excellent.
Thanks a lot.

352
00:24:10.633 --> 00:24:12.675
I was hoping you'd win,

353
00:24:12.758 --> 00:24:14.341
not that I wouldn't have been
nice to the other bloke too.

354
00:24:14.424 --> 00:24:17.258
Just always given him
the boring biscuits with no chocolate.

355
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:20.383
Thanks very much. Thanks...

356
00:24:21.967 --> 00:24:24.050
Natalie.

357
00:24:28.508 --> 00:24:33.383
God, come on, get a grip.
You're the prime minister, for God's sake.

358
00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:38.175
So what do you reckon to
our new prime minister then?

359
00:24:38.258 --> 00:24:42.383
I like him. I can't understand
why he's not married though.

360
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:45.758
You know the type,
he's married to his job.

361
00:24:45.883 --> 00:24:48.967
Either that or gay
as a picnic basket.

362
00:24:49.175 --> 00:24:52.508
Excuse me, Judy,
if you could just lower the nipples

363
00:24:52.591 --> 00:24:53.591
and cheat them
a bit to the left?

364
00:24:53.675 --> 00:24:54.800
Okay.

365
00:24:58.549 --> 00:25:01.008
I have to say, Judy,
this is a real pleasure.

366
00:25:01.092 --> 00:25:04.591
It's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

367
00:25:04.883 --> 00:25:06.841
- Thank you.
- Well, you know...

368
00:25:07.092 --> 00:25:08.508
- And ditto.
- Thank you.

369
00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:10.675
And the move again,
please, Judy.

370
00:25:11.175 --> 00:25:12.300
- Sorry.
- God, sorry.

371
00:25:12.383 --> 00:25:14.508
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

372
00:25:16.591 --> 00:25:18.466
Exciting news!

373
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:19.591
What?

374
00:25:19.675 --> 00:25:23.258
I've bought a ticket to the States.
I'm off in three weeks.

375
00:25:23.341 --> 00:25:24.549
- No.
- Yes!

376
00:25:24.633 --> 00:25:27.633
To a fantastic place
called Wisconsin.

377
00:25:27.716 --> 00:25:28.758
No!

378
00:25:28.841 --> 00:25:32.341
Yes! Wisconsin babes,
here comes Sir Colin!

379
00:25:32.424 --> 00:25:37.133
No, Col! There are a few babes
in America, I grant you,

380
00:25:37.217 --> 00:25:39.841
but they're already going out
with rich, attractive guys.

381
00:25:39.925 --> 00:25:42.800
Tone, you're just jealous.

382
00:25:42.883 --> 00:25:46.841
You know perfectly well
that any bar anywhere in America

383
00:25:46.925 --> 00:25:51.424
contains 10 girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me

384
00:25:51.508 --> 00:25:52.841
than the whole of
the United Kingdom.

385
00:25:52.925 --> 00:25:55.925
That is total bollocks.
You've actually gone mad now.

386
00:25:56.008 --> 00:26:01.050
No, I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince William
without the weird family.

387
00:26:01.133 --> 00:26:02.675
No, Colin, no!

388
00:26:02.758 --> 00:26:04.508
Yes!

389
00:26:04.591 --> 00:26:06.300
Ja, darling!

390
00:26:06.383 --> 00:26:09.633
Right, the Christmas party,
not my favorite night of the year

391
00:26:09.716 --> 00:26:12.300
and your unhappy
job to organize.

392
00:26:12.383 --> 00:26:13.549
Tell me.

393
00:26:13.633 --> 00:26:15.341
It's basic, really.

394
00:26:15.424 --> 00:26:19.383
Find a venue, over-order on the drinks,
bulk buy the guacamole

395
00:26:19.466 --> 00:26:23.383
and advise the girls to avoid Kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled.

396
00:26:23.591 --> 00:26:25.591
Wives and family and stuff?

397
00:26:25.675 --> 00:26:27.758
Yeah.
I mean, not children.

398
00:26:27.841 --> 00:26:31.466
But their wives and
girlfriends, et cetera.

399
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:34.424
Oh, Christ, you haven't
got some horrible six-foot,

400
00:26:34.508 --> 00:26:37.300
tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend
you'll be bringing, have you?

401
00:26:37.383 --> 00:26:41.967
No. I'll just be hanging around
the mistletoe, hoping to be kissed.

402
00:26:43.508 --> 00:26:44.633
Really?

403
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.300
Right.

404
00:26:57.466 --> 00:26:59.883
He now spends all
the time in his room.

405
00:26:59.967 --> 00:27:01.300
I mean,
he'll be up there now.

406
00:27:01.383 --> 00:27:04.716
That's nothing unusual
about that. My horrid son...

407
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.967
- Bernard?
- Bernard.

408
00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.800
Stays in his room all the time.
Thank goodness.

409
00:27:09.883 --> 00:27:12.383
Yeah, but, Karen,
this is all the time.

410
00:27:14.383 --> 00:27:17.508
I'm afraid that there's something
really wrong, you know?

411
00:27:18.591 --> 00:27:19.967
I mean, clearly it's
about his mom,

412
00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:25.175
but, Christ, he might be injecting heroin
into his eyeballs for all I know.

413
00:27:25.967 --> 00:27:27.383
At the age of 11?

414
00:27:27.466 --> 00:27:29.841
Well, maybe
not his eyeballs then.

415
00:27:29.925 --> 00:27:31.883
Maybe just his veins.

416
00:27:31.967 --> 00:27:33.883
You see, the problem is
it was his mom

417
00:27:33.967 --> 00:27:36.591
who always used to talk to
him, you know, and...

418
00:27:37.841 --> 00:27:41.258
I don't know, this
whole stepfather thing

419
00:27:41.341 --> 00:27:45.341
seems suddenly to somehow matter
like it never did before.

420
00:27:45.424 --> 00:27:50.258
Listen, it was always going to
be a totally shit time.

421
00:27:50.424 --> 00:27:51.883
Just be patient.

422
00:27:53.133 --> 00:27:55.383
And maybe check
the room for needles.

423
00:27:55.466 --> 00:27:58.092
And then when he
sometimes does come out,

424
00:27:58.175 --> 00:28:00.300
it's obvious
he's been crying.

425
00:28:09.508 --> 00:28:13.092
It's just such
a ridiculous waste.

426
00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:16.466
And now if it's going to ruin
Sam's life as well...

427
00:28:17.841 --> 00:28:19.424
I just don't know.

428
00:28:21.133 --> 00:28:25.258
Get a grip.
People hate sissies.

429
00:28:25.633 --> 00:28:28.508
No one's ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time.

430
00:28:29.133 --> 00:28:31.925
Yeah. Absolutely.

431
00:28:32.092 --> 00:28:34.092
Helpful.

432
00:28:41.841 --> 00:28:45.883
So, what's the problem,
Samuel?

433
00:28:47.383 --> 00:28:52.050
Is it just Mom or
is it something else?

434
00:28:53.841 --> 00:28:55.925
Maybe school?

435
00:28:56.967 --> 00:28:58.841
Are you being bullied?

436
00:29:00.424 --> 00:29:02.549
Or is it something worse?

437
00:29:04.424 --> 00:29:06.633
Can you give me
any clues at all?

438
00:29:08.133 --> 00:29:10.258
You really want to know?

439
00:29:10.341 --> 00:29:11.591
I really want to know.

440
00:29:11.675 --> 00:29:14.217
Even though you won't be
able to do anything to help?

441
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.591
Even if that's the case,
yeah.

442
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:21.133
Okay. Well...

443
00:29:22.341 --> 00:29:24.800
Truth is, actually,

444
00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.341
I'm in love.

445
00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:29.549
Sorry?

446
00:29:29.758 --> 00:29:32.508
I know I should be thinking
about Mom all the time and I am,

447
00:29:32.591 --> 00:29:34.217
but the truth is I'm in love.

448
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.841
I was before she died, and
there's nothing I can do about it.

449
00:29:38.591 --> 00:29:41.758
Aren't you a bit
young to be in love?

450
00:29:41.841 --> 00:29:42.883
No.

451
00:29:42.967 --> 00:29:45.675
Well, okay, well...

452
00:29:47.424 --> 00:29:50.092
I mean,
I'm a little relieved.

453
00:29:51.217 --> 00:29:53.175
- Why?
- Because I...

454
00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:55.466
thought it would
be something worse.

455
00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.675
Worse than the total
agony of being in love?

456
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:05.258
No, you're right.
Total agony.

457
00:30:43.424 --> 00:30:44.508
Night, Sarah.

458
00:30:44.591 --> 00:30:45.800
Night, Karl.

459
00:30:55.466 --> 00:30:57.466
Yeah, absolutely.

460
00:30:58.967 --> 00:31:00.633
Free as a bird. Fire away.

461
00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:34.424
Alone again.

462
00:31:35.841 --> 00:31:37.008
Naturally.

463
00:31:37.675 --> 00:31:39.050
I'll deal with it.

464
00:31:39.133 --> 00:31:40.300
All right.

465
00:31:41.925 --> 00:31:43.841
- Natalie.
- Sir.

466
00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.383
Thanks. Natalie.

467
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:55.175
I'm starting to feel

468
00:31:56.967 --> 00:32:00.300
uncomfortable about us working
in such close proximity every day

469
00:32:00.383 --> 00:32:01.716
and me knowing so
little about you.

470
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.008
It seems...
It seems elitist and wrong.

471
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:07.424
Well, there's not
much to know.

472
00:32:07.633 --> 00:32:11.008
Well, where do you live,
for instance?

473
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.383
Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

474
00:32:13.883 --> 00:32:17.133
My sister lives in Wandsworth.

475
00:32:18.258 --> 00:32:20.466
So which exactly
is the dodgy end?

476
00:32:20.883 --> 00:32:22.300
Right at the end
of the High Street,

477
00:32:22.383 --> 00:32:24.633
Harris Street,
near the Queen's Head.

478
00:32:24.716 --> 00:32:26.758
Yeah, yeah, that is dodgy.

479
00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.675
And you live with your
husband? Boyfriend?

480
00:32:32.716 --> 00:32:34.549
Three illegitimate
but charming children?

481
00:32:34.633 --> 00:32:35.675
No.

482
00:32:35.758 --> 00:32:37.341
I've just split up with
my boyfriend, actually,

483
00:32:37.424 --> 00:32:40.217
so I'm back with my
mom and dad for a while.

484
00:32:41.925 --> 00:32:43.300
Sorry.

485
00:32:43.383 --> 00:32:44.967
No, it's fine.

486
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:48.967
I'm well shot of him.
He said I was getting fat.

487
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:50.217
I beg your pardon?

488
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:54.300
He said no one's gonna fancy a girl
with thighs the size of big tree trunks.

489
00:32:54.383 --> 00:32:56.883
Not a nice guy, actually,
in the end.

490
00:32:58.466 --> 00:33:00.466
No.

491
00:33:07.633 --> 00:33:09.758
You know,

492
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:13.383
being prime minister,
I could just have him murdered.

493
00:33:14.633 --> 00:33:17.008
Thank you, sir.
I'll think about it.

494
00:33:17.508 --> 00:33:21.175
Do. The SAS are
absolutely charming.

495
00:33:21.258 --> 00:33:25.092
Ruthless, trained killers
are just a phone call away.

496
00:33:30.841 --> 00:33:32.841
Oh, God.

497
00:33:35.508 --> 00:33:37.633
Did you have this kind
of problem?

498
00:33:40.217 --> 00:33:42.466
Yeah, course you did,
you saucy minx.

499
00:33:42.967 --> 00:33:46.258
So, let's go.
We can definitely crack this.

500
00:33:46.466 --> 00:33:48.800
Remember,
I was a kid once too.

501
00:33:49.217 --> 00:33:53.383
So, come on, it's someone
at school. Right?

502
00:33:53.466 --> 00:33:55.092
- Yeah.
- Good, good.

503
00:33:55.175 --> 00:33:58.466
And what does she, he,
feel about you?

504
00:33:58.549 --> 00:34:01.341
She doesn't even know my name.

505
00:34:01.508 --> 00:34:04.008
And even if she did,
she'd despise me.

506
00:34:04.424 --> 00:34:06.424
She's the coolest girl
in school,

507
00:34:06.633 --> 00:34:09.508
and everyone worships her
because she's heaven.

508
00:34:11.008 --> 00:34:13.466
Good. Good.

509
00:34:14.633 --> 00:34:19.591
Well, basically
you're fucked, aren't you?

510
00:34:25.675 --> 00:34:28.258
Hi there, and welcome back.

511
00:34:28.341 --> 00:34:30.383
So, Billy, three weeks
till Christmas,

512
00:34:30.466 --> 00:34:32.716
looks like the real
competition is gonna be Blue.

513
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.341
Yeah, I saw them on
the show last week.

514
00:34:35.424 --> 00:34:37.175
They weren't very nice
about my record.

515
00:34:37.258 --> 00:34:38.716
No. Little scamps.

516
00:34:39.925 --> 00:34:43.217
But very, very
talented musicians.

517
00:34:43.883 --> 00:34:47.341
Yeah. Billy, I understand you've got
a prize for our competition winners.

518
00:34:47.424 --> 00:34:52.967
Yes, I have, Ant or Dec.
It's a personalized felt-tip pen.

519
00:34:53.383 --> 00:34:54.633
Great.

520
00:34:54.716 --> 00:34:58.549
It's brilliant.
It even writes on glass,

521
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.008
so if you've got
a framed picture,

522
00:35:01.092 --> 00:35:03.383
like, for instance,
this one of Blue,

523
00:35:03.466 --> 00:35:05.466
you can just write on it.

524
00:35:19.341 --> 00:35:21.716
A lot of kids
watching, Billy.

525
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.008
Yeah.

526
00:35:23.549 --> 00:35:26.217
Hiya, kids.

527
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.383
Here's an important message
from your Uncle Bill.

528
00:35:29.591 --> 00:35:31.675
Don't buy drugs.

529
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.716
Become a pop star
and they give you them for free.

530
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.466
And I do believe
it's a commercial break.

531
00:35:39.549 --> 00:35:41.841
Thank goodness.
We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

532
00:35:54.591 --> 00:35:56.133
Look at him!

533
00:35:56.217 --> 00:35:58.092
Just a minute.

534
00:35:58.175 --> 00:36:00.633
Actually, they're not
funny. They're art.

535
00:36:05.258 --> 00:36:07.633
Okay, let's say
Thursday, my place.

536
00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:10.258
Great. But for now
I've got Juliet on the other line.

537
00:36:10.341 --> 00:36:12.633
Can I patch you through?
She wants to ask you a favor.

538
00:36:12.716 --> 00:36:14.300
Okay, fine.

539
00:36:14.383 --> 00:36:17.300
Thanks and be nice.

540
00:36:17.383 --> 00:36:18.925
I'm always nice.

541
00:36:19.008 --> 00:36:22.383
You know what I mean,
Marky, be friendly.

542
00:36:22.466 --> 00:36:24.549
- I'm always...
- Mark?

543
00:36:25.133 --> 00:36:27.841
Hi.
How was the honeymoon?

544
00:36:28.175 --> 00:36:30.967
It was great. And thanks
for the gorgeous sendoff.

545
00:36:31.341 --> 00:36:32.424
So, what can I do for you?

546
00:36:32.508 --> 00:36:34.175
It's only a tiny favor.

547
00:36:34.258 --> 00:36:37.341
I've just tried the wedding video,
and it's a complete disaster.

548
00:36:37.424 --> 00:36:39.300
It's come out
all blue and wibbly.

549
00:36:39.383 --> 00:36:40.383
I'm sorry.

550
00:36:40.466 --> 00:36:42.549
I remember you
filming a lot in the day

551
00:36:42.633 --> 00:36:44.383
and I just wondered if
I could look at your stuff.

552
00:36:44.466 --> 00:36:46.383
No, look, to be honest,
I didn't really...

553
00:36:46.466 --> 00:36:49.716
Please. All I want is just one shot
of me in a wedding dress

554
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.591
that isn't bright turquoise.

555
00:36:51.925 --> 00:36:54.508
Okay, I'll have a look, but to be honest,
I'm pretty sure I wiped it,

556
00:36:54.591 --> 00:36:56.341
so don't get any hopes up.

557
00:36:56.424 --> 00:36:57.758
Must go.

558
00:37:04.008 --> 00:37:06.466
Any progress with
our matchmaking plans?

559
00:37:06.549 --> 00:37:10.591
No. I've done fuck-all and never
will because he's too good for me.

560
00:37:10.675 --> 00:37:12.675
How true.

561
00:37:14.633 --> 00:37:16.175
Stop.

562
00:37:16.258 --> 00:37:18.424
And, of course,
your mobile goes.

563
00:37:19.591 --> 00:37:22.383
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

564
00:37:23.383 --> 00:37:25.175
So, how's the
Christmas party going?

565
00:37:25.258 --> 00:37:26.341
Good.

566
00:37:26.424 --> 00:37:28.466
Think I've found a venue.
Friend of mine works there.

567
00:37:28.549 --> 00:37:30.466
What's it like?

568
00:37:30.549 --> 00:37:31.800
Good. Good.

569
00:37:32.133 --> 00:37:37.092
It's an art gallery. Full of dark
corners for doing dark deeds.

570
00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:41.716
Right.

571
00:37:42.883 --> 00:37:45.217
Good. Well,
I suppose I should

572
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.217
take a look at it
or something.

573
00:37:47.466 --> 00:37:49.508
You should.

574
00:38:10.466 --> 00:38:14.341
Welcome back. And this year
you bring a lady guest?

575
00:38:14.424 --> 00:38:17.508
No. There's a change
of situation. Just me.

576
00:38:17.883 --> 00:38:20.175
Am I sad or not sad?

577
00:38:20.258 --> 00:38:21.883
I think you're not surprised.

578
00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:23.800
And you stay here
till Christmas?

579
00:38:23.883 --> 00:38:24.925
Yeah, yeah.

580
00:38:25.008 --> 00:38:30.008
Good. Well, I find you
a perfect lady to clean the house.

581
00:38:30.466 --> 00:38:32.675
This is Aurelia.

582
00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:49.217
Unfortunately, she cannot
speak French, just like you.

583
00:38:49.466 --> 00:38:51.466
She's Portuguese.

584
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.508
I think she's 10 years
too young to remember

585
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:04.841
there was a footballer
called Eusebio.

586
00:39:04.925 --> 00:39:07.217
And molto bueno is Spanish.

587
00:39:07.424 --> 00:39:08.841
Right. Right.

588
00:39:09.008 --> 00:39:11.675
Anyway, it's nice
to meet you and...

589
00:39:12.466 --> 00:39:14.424
Perhaps you can drive her home
at the end of her work?

590
00:39:14.508 --> 00:39:15.549
Absolutely, yes.

591
00:39:18.549 --> 00:39:20.466
Which is what? Turkish?

592
00:39:42.675 --> 00:39:45.383
No, right.
Silence is golden.

593
00:39:47.549 --> 00:39:49.424
As the Tremeloes said.

594
00:39:51.549 --> 00:39:54.341
Clever guys, although I think
the original version

595
00:39:54.424 --> 00:39:58.383
was by Frankie Valli
& the Four Seasons.

596
00:39:58.549 --> 00:40:00.508
Great band.

597
00:40:03.133 --> 00:40:04.383
Shut up.

598
00:40:16.217 --> 00:40:17.883
Mr. President!

599
00:40:19.466 --> 00:40:20.466
Over here, sir!

600
00:40:20.549 --> 00:40:22.466
What will you be
talking about?

601
00:40:25.175 --> 00:40:26.424
Mr. President, welcome.

602
00:40:26.508 --> 00:40:27.800
It's a pleasure to meet you.

603
00:40:27.883 --> 00:40:29.175
Come on through.

604
00:40:29.258 --> 00:40:30.508
I'm sorry your wife couldn't
make it, by the way.

605
00:40:30.591 --> 00:40:34.092
So is she. Although she would have
been kind of lonely, I'm sure.

606
00:40:34.175 --> 00:40:38.591
Yes. Pathetic, isn't it?
Just never been able to tie a girl down.

607
00:40:39.092 --> 00:40:41.341
Not sure that politics and
dating really go together.

608
00:40:41.424 --> 00:40:44.508
Really?
I've never found that.

609
00:40:44.591 --> 00:40:46.341
Yeah, well, the difference is
you're still sickeningly handsome,

610
00:40:46.424 --> 00:40:49.341
whereas I look increasingly
like my Aunt Mildred.

611
00:40:49.508 --> 00:40:51.217
Very jealous of your plane,
by the way.

612
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.050
Thank you. We love that
thing, I'll tell you.

613
00:40:54.133 --> 00:40:56.008
Natalie. Hi.

614
00:40:56.092 --> 00:40:58.508
Morning, ma'am.
How's your day so far?

615
00:41:00.383 --> 00:41:01.800
Excellent.

616
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.925
My goodness, that's a pretty little
son of a bitch, right there.

617
00:41:08.008 --> 00:41:09.967
Did you see those pipes?

618
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.549
Yeah, yeah,
she's terrific at her job.

619
00:41:13.883 --> 00:41:18.300
No, absolutely not. We cannot
and will not consult on that either.

620
00:41:18.383 --> 00:41:20.175
That is unexpected.

621
00:41:20.383 --> 00:41:22.508
Well, it shouldn't be.

622
00:41:22.591 --> 00:41:25.633
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

623
00:41:26.133 --> 00:41:28.341
We're just being consistent
with their policies.

624
00:41:28.424 --> 00:41:31.258
Well, with all respect, sir,
they were bad policies.

625
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.217
All right, thanks, Alex.

626
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:38.925
I don't think we're making progress here.
Let's move on, shall we?

627
00:41:41.383 --> 00:41:44.883
Well, now, that was
an interesting day.

628
00:41:46.591 --> 00:41:48.300
Sorry if our line was firm,

629
00:41:48.383 --> 00:41:50.383
but there's no point in
tiptoeing around today,

630
00:41:50.466 --> 00:41:53.092
then just disappointing you
for four years.

631
00:41:53.424 --> 00:41:56.466
I mean, I have plans
and I plan to see them through.

632
00:41:56.549 --> 00:41:59.466
Absolutely. Now, there is one final thing
I think we should look at.

633
00:41:59.549 --> 00:42:02.383
It's very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

634
00:42:02.675 --> 00:42:05.175
I'll give you anything
you ask for.

635
00:42:05.508 --> 00:42:08.508
As long as it's not something
I don't wanna give.

636
00:42:13.591 --> 00:42:15.175
Hi.

637
00:42:15.258 --> 00:42:17.258
Pathetic.

638
00:42:38.341 --> 00:42:39.591
It's great Scotch.

639
00:42:41.466 --> 00:42:44.341
I'll...
I'll be going then.

640
00:42:46.758 --> 00:42:48.591
Natalie,

641
00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:52.133
I hope to see much more of you
as our two great countries

642
00:42:52.217 --> 00:42:53.967
work toward
a better future.

643
00:42:54.508 --> 00:42:55.883
Thank you, sir.

644
00:43:13.258 --> 00:43:14.925
Yes, Peter.

645
00:43:15.008 --> 00:43:17.466
Mr. President,
has it been a good visit?

646
00:43:17.675 --> 00:43:20.508
Very satisfactory indeed.

647
00:43:20.591 --> 00:43:22.883
We got what we came for,

648
00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:26.633
and our special relationship
is still very special.

649
00:43:26.716 --> 00:43:29.133
And, Prime Minister?

650
00:43:29.633 --> 00:43:31.466
I love that word
relationship.

651
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:33.883
Covers all manner of sins,
doesn't it?

652
00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:37.883
I fear that this has become
a bad relationship,

653
00:43:38.967 --> 00:43:42.883
a relationship based on the President
taking exactly what he wants

654
00:43:43.217 --> 00:43:48.050
and casually ignoring all those things
that really matter to

655
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:52.967
Britain.

656
00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:57.008
We may be a small country,
but we're a great one too.

657
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.466
The country of Shakespeare,
Churchill, The Beatles,

658
00:44:00.549 --> 00:44:02.424
Sean Connery, Harry Potter.

659
00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:09.341
David Beckham's right foot.
David Beckham's left foot, come to that.

660
00:44:09.633 --> 00:44:13.508
And a friend who bullies us
is no longer a friend.

661
00:44:13.591 --> 00:44:16.883
And since bullies only respond to
strength, from now onward,

662
00:44:17.508 --> 00:44:20.549
I will be prepared
to be much stronger.

663
00:44:20.633 --> 00:44:22.716
And the President
should be prepared for that.

664
00:44:33.883 --> 00:44:35.883
Mr. President!

665
00:44:40.549 --> 00:44:41.549
Joe.

666
00:44:42.383 --> 00:44:44.549
It's your sister on line four.

667
00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:47.258
All right.

668
00:44:47.925 --> 00:44:50.424
Yes, I'm very busy and important.
How can I help you?

669
00:44:50.508 --> 00:44:52.549
Have you gone
completely insane?

670
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.424
You can't be sensible
all the time.

671
00:44:54.508 --> 00:44:56.217
You can if you're
prime minister.

672
00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.508
Oh, dear, it's the Chancellor of
the Exchequer on the other line.

673
00:44:58.591 --> 00:44:59.591
- No, it isn't!
- I'll call you back.

674
00:44:59.675 --> 00:45:01.008
No, you won't!

675
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:05.967
The trouble with being
the prime minister's sister is

676
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.175
it does put your life into
rather harsh perspective.

677
00:45:09.967 --> 00:45:13.175
What did my brother do today?
He stood up and fought for his country.

678
00:45:13.258 --> 00:45:17.383
And what did I do? I made
a papier-mâché lobster head.

679
00:45:17.675 --> 00:45:20.341
What is this
we're listening to?

680
00:45:20.549 --> 00:45:22.466
Joni Mitchell.

681
00:45:22.716 --> 00:45:25.424
I can't believe you still listen
to Joni Mitchell.

682
00:45:25.841 --> 00:45:29.300
I love her and true
love lasts a lifetime.

683
00:45:30.675 --> 00:45:32.383
Joni Mitchell is
the woman who taught

684
00:45:32.466 --> 00:45:35.549
your cold English wife
how to feel.

685
00:45:35.633 --> 00:45:36.716
Did she?
Well, that's good.

686
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.466
I must write to her
sometime and say thanks.

687
00:45:41.508 --> 00:45:43.675
Now, which doll should we give
Daisy's little friend Emily?

688
00:45:43.758 --> 00:45:45.508
The one that looks
like a transvestite

689
00:45:45.591 --> 00:45:47.800
or the one that looks
like a dominatrix?

690
00:45:49.341 --> 00:45:52.383
It's almost enough to
make you feel patriotic,

691
00:45:52.466 --> 00:45:54.591
so here's one for our
ass-kicking prime minister.

692
00:45:54.675 --> 00:45:56.217
I think he'll enjoy this.

693
00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.841
A golden oldie
for a golden oldie.

694
00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:50.633
Yeah...

695
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:52.675
Mary, I've been thinking,

696
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.175
can we move the Japanese
ambassador to 4:00 tomorrow?

697
00:46:56.258 --> 00:46:57.300
Certainly, sir.

698
00:46:57.383 --> 00:46:59.300
Terrific.
Thanks so much.

699
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.424
Would you like the last...

700
00:47:14.175 --> 00:47:16.175
That's all right,
more for me.

701
00:47:20.092 --> 00:47:22.549
I'm very lucky I've got
one of those constitutions

702
00:47:22.633 --> 00:47:24.341
where I never put on weight.

703
00:47:26.967 --> 00:47:28.175
Hello.

704
00:47:37.424 --> 00:47:39.800
Sorry.

705
00:47:43.424 --> 00:47:45.008
Hello?

706
00:48:01.008 --> 00:48:02.424
Thank you.

707
00:48:04.508 --> 00:48:06.300
No. Hold on.

708
00:48:06.383 --> 00:48:09.217
God, it's half the book.
No.

709
00:48:09.341 --> 00:48:12.466
Just leave them, please!
They're not important.

710
00:48:12.716 --> 00:48:15.508
They're not worth it!

711
00:48:15.675 --> 00:48:17.800
Stop! Stop.

712
00:48:22.383 --> 00:48:24.508
It's all just rubbish.

713
00:48:26.341 --> 00:48:28.424
Just leave it.

714
00:48:40.466 --> 00:48:42.092
God, she's in.

715
00:48:43.675 --> 00:48:47.383
Right. And now she'll think
I'm a total spaz if I don't go in too.

716
00:48:54.424 --> 00:48:56.424
Fuck, it's freezing! Fuck!

717
00:49:00.925 --> 00:49:03.591
It's not worth it.
This isn't bloody Shakespeare.

718
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:09.758
Just stop. Stop.

719
00:49:13.175 --> 00:49:14.800
I really must do copies.

720
00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.466
There'd better not be eels in here.
I can't stand eels.

721
00:49:21.424 --> 00:49:23.591
Oh, God,
what the hell is that?

722
00:49:33.549 --> 00:49:35.800
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

723
00:49:40.424 --> 00:49:43.466
I know. I'll name one of
the characters after you.

724
00:49:51.424 --> 00:49:54.508
Or I could give you
5% of the profits.

725
00:50:10.758 --> 00:50:13.217
Yes. It's...

726
00:50:18.967 --> 00:50:21.549
Crime. Crime, murder.

727
00:50:24.591 --> 00:50:27.424
Scary? Yes,
sometimes scary.

728
00:50:27.508 --> 00:50:32.008
And sometimes not.
Mainly scary how bad the writing is.

729
00:50:53.008 --> 00:50:54.175
Sure.

730
00:50:58.424 --> 00:51:01.508
It's my favorite time of day,

731
00:51:01.633 --> 00:51:03.633
driving you.

732
00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:17.758
Sorry.

733
00:51:45.508 --> 00:51:48.591
And coming up later this morning,
it's this guy...

734
00:51:54.466 --> 00:51:56.675
The bad granddad
of rock and roll,

735
00:51:56.758 --> 00:51:59.508
here at 10:30.
Do not switch off.

736
00:52:05.925 --> 00:52:07.300
Banoffee pie?

737
00:52:07.383 --> 00:52:09.300
No, thanks.

738
00:52:09.383 --> 00:52:12.716
Thank God. You would've broken
my heart if you'd said yes.

739
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.133
Right, well, lucky you.

740
00:52:16.591 --> 00:52:18.341
Can I come in?

741
00:52:18.424 --> 00:52:20.383
Yeah, well,
I'm a bit busy...

742
00:52:20.466 --> 00:52:22.466
Well, I was just passing,
and I thought

743
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:24.925
we might check
that video thing out.

744
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:28.050
I thought I might be able to
swap it for some pie

745
00:52:28.133 --> 00:52:30.508
or maybe Munchies?

746
00:52:30.591 --> 00:52:33.050
Actually, I was being serious.
I don't know where it is.

747
00:52:33.133 --> 00:52:35.341
I'll have a poke
around tonight then...

748
00:52:35.424 --> 00:52:38.175
Mark, can I say something?

749
00:52:38.258 --> 00:52:40.258
Yeah.

750
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.466
I know you're Peter's
best friend,

751
00:52:43.925 --> 00:52:48.841
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

752
00:52:49.092 --> 00:52:51.008
No, don't argue.

753
00:52:51.967 --> 00:52:54.258
We've never got friendly.

754
00:52:54.591 --> 00:52:56.883
But I just wanted to say,
I hope that can change.

755
00:52:56.967 --> 00:52:58.800
I'm nice. I really am.

756
00:52:58.883 --> 00:53:01.383
Apart from my terrible
taste in pie and...

757
00:53:02.508 --> 00:53:05.008
It would be great
if we could be friends.

758
00:53:05.633 --> 00:53:07.633
Absolutely. Absolutely.

759
00:53:11.591 --> 00:53:12.591
Great.

760
00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.675
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video though.

761
00:53:16.758 --> 00:53:18.716
I had a real search
when you first called

762
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.424
and couldn't find
any trace of it so...

763
00:53:20.508 --> 00:53:23.633
Well, there's one here that says,
Peter and Juliet's Wedding.

764
00:53:23.716 --> 00:53:25.967
Do you think we might
be on the right track?

765
00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:30.591
Yeah, well...
Wow. That could be it.

766
00:53:30.967 --> 00:53:32.050
Do you mind if I just...

767
00:53:32.133 --> 00:53:33.133
I've probably
taped over it.

768
00:53:33.217 --> 00:53:36.300
Almost everything has episodes
of West Wing on it and...

769
00:53:41.424 --> 00:53:43.466
Oh, bingo.

770
00:53:45.217 --> 00:53:47.466
That's lovely.

771
00:53:47.549 --> 00:53:49.383
Well done, you.

772
00:53:50.925 --> 00:53:53.092
That's gorgeous.

773
00:53:54.591 --> 00:53:58.549
Thank you so much, Mark.
This is exactly what I was hoping for.

774
00:54:05.591 --> 00:54:07.800
I look quite pretty.

775
00:54:14.675 --> 00:54:16.341
You've stayed rather close,
haven't you?

776
00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:12.800
They're all of me.

777
00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.716
Yeah. Yeah.

778
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.800
Yes.

779
00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.217
But...

780
00:55:56.217 --> 00:55:58.341
you never talk to me.

781
00:56:00.591 --> 00:56:02.591
You always talk to Peter.

782
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:07.424
You don't like me.

783
00:56:08.841 --> 00:56:10.800
I hope it's useful.

784
00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:13.883
Don't show it
around too much.

785
00:56:14.008 --> 00:56:17.050
Needs a bit of editing.

786
00:56:17.258 --> 00:56:20.758
Look, I've got to
get to a lunch.

787
00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:22.883
Early lunch.

788
00:56:23.133 --> 00:56:25.967
You can just show
yourself out, can't you?

789
00:56:31.591 --> 00:56:35.800
It's a self-preservation
thing, you see.

790
00:57:35.424 --> 00:57:36.591
Yeah.

791
00:57:39.633 --> 00:57:42.508
Annie, my darling,
my dream, my boat.

792
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:47.633
Need you to do
a favor for me.

793
00:57:47.716 --> 00:57:50.841
Of course. Anything for the
hero of the hour.

794
00:57:52.466 --> 00:57:55.549
Don't ask me why, and for heaven's sake,
don't read stuff into this,

795
00:57:55.633 --> 00:57:57.967
it's just a weird
personality thing.

796
00:57:58.217 --> 00:58:01.133
But you know Natalie
who works here?

797
00:58:01.841 --> 00:58:03.841
The chubby girl?

798
00:58:03.925 --> 00:58:05.925
Would we call her chubby?

799
00:58:06.217 --> 00:58:09.175
I think there's a pretty
sizeable ass there, yes, sir.

800
00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:10.925
Huge thighs.

801
00:58:11.675 --> 00:58:14.591
Yeah. Well, whatever.

802
00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:19.633
I'm sure she's a lovely girl,
but I wonder if you could

803
00:58:22.466 --> 00:58:24.050
redistribute her?

804
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:27.549
It's done.

805
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:04.424
Hey, Sammo. Can't sleep?

806
00:59:05.508 --> 00:59:07.508
I got some
terrible news today.

807
00:59:07.591 --> 00:59:09.466
Let's have it.

808
00:59:09.716 --> 00:59:11.466
Joanna's going
back to America.

809
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:12.800
Your girl's American?

810
00:59:12.883 --> 00:59:15.217
Yes, she's American.

811
00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.549
And she's not my girl.

812
00:59:17.633 --> 00:59:19.508
And she's going back
to America.

813
00:59:19.591 --> 00:59:21.549
That's the end of
my life as I know it.

814
00:59:21.633 --> 00:59:23.967
That is bad news.

815
00:59:26.217 --> 00:59:28.424
Well, we need Kate

816
00:59:28.508 --> 00:59:31.549
and we need Leo,
and we need them now.

817
00:59:32.383 --> 00:59:33.466
Come on.

818
00:59:37.591 --> 00:59:39.841
Hold on. Hold on.

819
00:59:40.133 --> 00:59:42.466
Keep your eyes closed.

820
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:44.258
Do you trust me?

821
00:59:44.341 --> 00:59:46.300
I trust you.

822
00:59:47.424 --> 00:59:48.758
Do you trust me?

823
00:59:48.841 --> 00:59:50.133
I trust you.

824
00:59:50.217 --> 00:59:51.383
Fool!

825
00:59:51.466 --> 00:59:53.258
Get off, you big bully.

826
00:59:55.341 --> 00:59:58.341
All right, open your eyes.

827
01:00:01.967 --> 01:00:05.424
You know, Sammy, I'm sure
she's unique and extraordinary,

828
01:00:06.424 --> 01:00:08.341
but general wisdom
is that in the end,

829
01:00:08.424 --> 01:00:10.800
there isn't just one
person for each of us.

830
01:00:12.967 --> 01:00:14.925
There was
for Kate and Leo.

831
01:00:15.508 --> 01:00:17.716
There was for you.

832
01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.633
And there is for me.

833
01:00:19.758 --> 01:00:21.675
She's the one.

834
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:26.300
Fair enough.
And her name's Joanna?

835
01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:30.133
Yeah, I know. Same as Mom.

836
01:00:40.591 --> 01:00:41.716
Yeah.

837
01:00:46.133 --> 01:00:47.633
Prime Minister.

838
01:00:47.716 --> 01:00:49.341
Thank you very much.

839
01:01:40.591 --> 01:01:43.175
Well, goodbye.

840
01:01:49.383 --> 01:01:50.466
It was...

841
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:08.092
<i>You know I love Christmas,
I always will</i>

842
01:03:09.383 --> 01:03:13.800
<i>My mind's made up,
the way that I feel</i>

843
01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:19.383
<i>There's no beginning,
there'll be no end</i>

844
01:03:31.466 --> 01:03:33.466
Daniel!

845
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:35.883
I have a plan.

846
01:03:35.967 --> 01:03:38.466
Thank the Lord! Tell me.

847
01:03:38.841 --> 01:03:42.300
Well, girls love
musicians, don't they?

848
01:03:42.383 --> 01:03:44.716
- Even the really weird ones get girlfriends.
- That's right.

849
01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.967
Meat Loaf definitely
got laid at least once.

850
01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:50.092
For God's sake, Ringo Starr
married a Bond girl.

851
01:03:51.508 --> 01:03:55.424
Whatever. There's this big concert
at the end of term and Joanna's in it.

852
01:03:55.591 --> 01:03:59.133
And I thought maybe if I was in the band
and played absolutely superbly,

853
01:03:59.217 --> 01:04:01.341
there's a chance that she might
actually fall in love with me.

854
01:04:01.424 --> 01:04:02.466
What do you think?

855
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:05.258
I think it's brilliant.
I think it's stellar.

856
01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:09.050
Apart from the one obvious tiny,
little, baby, little hiccup.

857
01:04:09.591 --> 01:04:11.383
I don't play
a musical instrument?

858
01:04:11.466 --> 01:04:12.549
Yes, sir.

859
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:15.549
A tiny, insignificant detail.

860
01:04:53.341 --> 01:04:55.675
I suppose I'd better go and
do the duty round.

861
01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:57.758
You're a saint.

862
01:05:05.008 --> 01:05:07.591
Any chance of a dance
with the boss?

863
01:05:08.591 --> 01:05:10.800
Yeah, sure, sure.

864
01:05:11.175 --> 01:05:13.549
As long as your boyfriend
doesn't mind.

865
01:05:16.341 --> 01:05:18.258
Not my boyfriend.

866
01:05:33.383 --> 01:05:35.591
You're looking
very pretty tonight.

867
01:05:37.383 --> 01:05:39.383
It's for you.

868
01:05:41.175 --> 01:05:43.175
Sorry?

869
01:05:45.549 --> 01:05:47.675
It's all for you, sir.

870
01:06:10.424 --> 01:06:12.675
This must be a very
exciting moment for you,

871
01:06:12.758 --> 01:06:14.841
fighting for the
Christmas number one.

872
01:06:14.925 --> 01:06:16.341
How's it looking so far?

873
01:06:16.424 --> 01:06:17.883
Very bad indeed.

874
01:06:18.508 --> 01:06:21.341
Blue are outselling me
five-to-one,

875
01:06:21.424 --> 01:06:23.633
but I'm hoping
for a late surge.

876
01:06:25.008 --> 01:06:27.424
And, if I reach number one,

877
01:06:27.508 --> 01:06:33.424
I promise to sing a song
stark naked on TV on Christmas Eve.

878
01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:35.716
Do you mean that?

879
01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.050
Well, of course
I mean it, Michael.

880
01:06:37.133 --> 01:06:39.675
Do you want a preview?
You old flirt.

881
01:06:44.092 --> 01:06:45.758
That'll never
make number one.

882
01:06:52.466 --> 01:06:56.133
I suppose it's his job
to dance with everyone, isn't it?

883
01:06:56.383 --> 01:06:58.508
Some more than others.

884
01:07:01.967 --> 01:07:03.800
Just one dance?

885
01:07:03.883 --> 01:07:05.508
Before we run
out of chances.

886
01:07:05.591 --> 01:07:07.341
Who, me?

887
01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:09.092
Unless you just...

888
01:07:09.175 --> 01:07:11.300
No! No! Good.

889
01:07:11.383 --> 01:07:13.466
Yes. Thanks.

890
01:08:42.758 --> 01:08:44.841
Well, then.
I'd better go.

891
01:08:45.008 --> 01:08:47.008
Okay.

892
01:08:48.466 --> 01:08:50.633
- Good night.
- Good night.

893
01:09:07.716 --> 01:09:09.675
Actually,

894
01:09:09.758 --> 01:09:11.967
- I don't have to go.
- Right. Good.

895
01:09:12.175 --> 01:09:14.300
- I mean...
- No, that's good.

896
01:09:15.466 --> 01:09:18.841
Just... Would you excuse me
for one second?

897
01:09:19.008 --> 01:09:21.383
- Sure.
- Just one second.

898
01:09:29.217 --> 01:09:31.758
Okay, that's done.

899
01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:37.633
Why don't you come upstairs
in about 10 seconds?

900
01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.008
- Ten seconds.
- Ten seconds.

901
01:10:40.508 --> 01:10:41.800
Just tug it.

902
01:10:41.883 --> 01:10:43.008
Okay.

903
01:11:04.549 --> 01:11:06.050
You're beautiful.

904
01:11:30.383 --> 01:11:32.591
I'd better answer that.

905
01:11:37.092 --> 01:11:40.092
Hello. Hi.
Hello, darling.

906
01:11:40.175 --> 01:11:43.050
No, no, I'm not busy.
No, fire away.

907
01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.800
Right.

908
01:11:46.424 --> 01:11:50.258
Yes, I... I'm not quite sure
it's gonna be possible

909
01:11:50.341 --> 01:11:52.758
to get the Pope on
the phone tonight but...

910
01:11:54.175 --> 01:11:59.549
Yes. Yes, I'm sure
he's very good at exorcism but...

911
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:05.383
Well, I'm sure

912
01:12:05.633 --> 01:12:09.300
Jon Bon Jovi is as well,
and I'll definitely look into it.

913
01:12:09.466 --> 01:12:13.092
Okay? Okay,
I'll talk to you later.

914
01:12:13.258 --> 01:12:15.258
All right, bye-bye.

915
01:12:20.466 --> 01:12:22.424
Sorry about that.

916
01:12:22.508 --> 01:12:24.424
No, it's fine.

917
01:12:24.591 --> 01:12:27.466
It's my brother.
He's not well. He calls a lot.

918
01:12:29.591 --> 01:12:31.967
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

919
01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:35.300
I mean, it's not really fine.
It is what it is,

920
01:12:35.383 --> 01:12:38.841
and sort of there being no parents now,
and us being over here,

921
01:12:38.925 --> 01:12:41.967
it's my job to keep an eye
on him. I mean, not my job.

922
01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:44.092
Obviously,
I'm glad to do it...

923
01:12:44.508 --> 01:12:45.925
That's okay.

924
01:12:46.008 --> 01:12:49.841
I mean, life is full
of interruptions and complications.

925
01:12:52.175 --> 01:12:53.675
So...

926
01:13:10.633 --> 01:13:12.633
Will it make him better?

927
01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:15.716
No.

928
01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.800
Then maybe

929
01:13:18.633 --> 01:13:20.633
don't answer.

930
01:13:28.424 --> 01:13:30.675
Hey. How you doing?

931
01:13:31.383 --> 01:13:34.466
Right, right. No, please.

932
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:37.925
Please, please,
don't, little darling.

933
01:13:38.008 --> 01:13:42.549
Between the two of us we'll find
the answer and it won't hurt anymore.

934
01:13:42.633 --> 01:13:46.591
No, no.
No, I'm not busy. I...

935
01:13:48.383 --> 01:13:51.549
Of course if you want me
to come over I will.

936
01:13:53.591 --> 01:13:55.383
Okay.

937
01:14:04.925 --> 01:14:07.258
That was a good night.

938
01:14:07.383 --> 01:14:08.716
Except I felt fat.

939
01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.008
Don't be ridiculous.

940
01:14:10.092 --> 01:14:11.508
It's true.

941
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:15.758
Nowadays the only clothes
I can get into were once owned by Pavarotti.

942
01:14:15.841 --> 01:14:18.633
I always think
Pavarotti dresses very well.

943
01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.424
Mia's very pretty.

944
01:14:26.424 --> 01:14:28.424
Is she?

945
01:14:29.967 --> 01:14:32.758
You know she is, darling.

946
01:14:32.841 --> 01:14:34.967
Be careful there.

947
01:14:58.133 --> 01:15:00.800
Have you been watching
stuff on TV?

948
01:15:02.758 --> 01:15:03.925
Yeah.

949
01:15:05.175 --> 01:15:07.050
- Every night.
- Good.

950
01:15:07.133 --> 01:15:09.217
And every day.

951
01:15:16.383 --> 01:15:17.549
The nurses are
trying to kill me.

952
01:15:17.633 --> 01:15:19.758
Nobody's trying
to kill you, babe.

953
01:15:27.466 --> 01:15:29.466
Thank you.

954
01:15:32.341 --> 01:15:34.508
Don't do that, my darling.

955
01:15:36.841 --> 01:15:38.841
Thank you.

956
01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.883
Don't do that.

957
01:16:21.008 --> 01:16:23.508
Right. Back at 3:00.
Christmas shopping,

958
01:16:23.591 --> 01:16:25.258
never an easy or
a pleasant task.

959
01:16:25.341 --> 01:16:27.258
Are you gonna
get me something?

960
01:16:31.967 --> 01:16:33.925
I don't know,
I hadn't thought.

961
01:16:34.383 --> 01:16:35.883
And where's Sarah,
by the way?

962
01:16:35.967 --> 01:16:38.591
She couldn't make it
in today. Family thing.

963
01:16:38.758 --> 01:16:42.341
There's a word for hangover
I've never heard before.

964
01:16:42.841 --> 01:16:44.133
See you later.

965
01:16:44.217 --> 01:16:46.841
Yes. Looking forward to it.

966
01:16:49.967 --> 01:16:51.967
A lot.

967
01:17:04.341 --> 01:17:06.466
So are you gonna
give me something?

968
01:17:07.466 --> 01:17:09.925
I thought I made
it clear last night.

969
01:17:10.008 --> 01:17:12.549
When it comes to me,
you can have everything.

970
01:17:13.967 --> 01:17:17.341
So, what do you need?

971
01:17:18.591 --> 01:17:22.424
Something along the stationery line?
Are you short of staplers?

972
01:17:22.925 --> 01:17:26.217
No. I don't want
something I need.

973
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:29.591
I want something I want,
something pretty.

974
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.633
Right.

975
01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:35.591
Right.

976
01:17:43.508 --> 01:17:46.883
Sorry I'm late. I had to drop off
Bernie at rehearsal.

977
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:53.424
Right, well, listen, you keep
yourself occupied for 10 minutes

978
01:17:53.508 --> 01:17:56.549
while I go and do the boring
stuff for our mothers.

979
01:18:19.008 --> 01:18:21.050
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

980
01:18:21.175 --> 01:18:23.549
Looking for anything
in particular, sir?

981
01:18:23.633 --> 01:18:27.133
Yes. That necklace there,
how much is it?

982
01:18:27.383 --> 01:18:29.508
It's £270.

983
01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:34.008
All right. I'll have it.

984
01:18:34.092 --> 01:18:35.258
Lovely.

985
01:18:38.258 --> 01:18:41.217
Would you like it
gift-wrapped?

986
01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:43.341
Yes, all right.

987
01:18:43.424 --> 01:18:44.549
Lovely.

988
01:18:47.133 --> 01:18:49.300
Let me just
pop it in the box.

989
01:18:51.508 --> 01:18:52.633
There.

990
01:18:52.716 --> 01:18:55.341
Look,
could we be quite quick?

991
01:18:55.424 --> 01:18:56.758
Certainly, sir.

992
01:18:56.841 --> 01:18:59.591
Ready in
the flashiest of flashes.

993
01:19:06.633 --> 01:19:08.217
- There.
- That's great.

994
01:19:08.466 --> 01:19:11.424
Not quite finished.

995
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:15.675
Look, actually,
I don't need a bag.

996
01:19:15.758 --> 01:19:17.383
I'll just put it
in my pocket.

997
01:19:17.466 --> 01:19:18.967
This isn't a bag, sir.

998
01:19:19.466 --> 01:19:20.591
Really?

999
01:19:20.675 --> 01:19:22.758
This is so much
more than a bag.

1000
01:19:45.758 --> 01:19:48.050
Could we be
quite quick, please?

1001
01:20:09.675 --> 01:20:10.800
What's that?

1002
01:20:10.883 --> 01:20:12.633
It's a cinnamon stick, sir.

1003
01:20:12.925 --> 01:20:14.383
Actually,
I really can't wait.

1004
01:20:14.466 --> 01:20:16.092
You won't regret it, sir.

1005
01:20:16.175 --> 01:20:17.758
Want to bet?

1006
01:20:17.841 --> 01:20:20.424
'Tis but
the work of a moment.

1007
01:20:24.092 --> 01:20:26.258
There we go.
Almost finished.

1008
01:20:26.383 --> 01:20:28.092
Almost finished?
What else can there be?

1009
01:20:28.175 --> 01:20:29.424
Are you gonna
dip it in yogurt?

1010
01:20:29.508 --> 01:20:30.925
Cover it with
chocolate buttons?

1011
01:20:31.008 --> 01:20:33.967
No, sir, we're going to pop
it in the Christmas box.

1012
01:20:34.217 --> 01:20:35.508
But I don't want
a Christmas box.

1013
01:20:35.591 --> 01:20:36.967
But you said you wanted it
gift-wrapped.

1014
01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:38.133
I did but...

1015
01:20:38.217 --> 01:20:39.466
This is the final flourish.

1016
01:20:39.549 --> 01:20:40.591
Can I just pay?

1017
01:20:40.675 --> 01:20:41.841
All we need now...

1018
01:20:41.925 --> 01:20:43.383
Oh, God.

1019
01:20:43.466 --> 01:20:44.466
Is a sprig of holly.

1020
01:20:44.549 --> 01:20:45.591
No, no, no, no.

1021
01:20:45.675 --> 01:20:47.466
- No bloody holly.
- But, sir...

1022
01:20:47.549 --> 01:20:49.675
Leave it. Leave it.
Just leave it.

1023
01:20:50.424 --> 01:20:51.967
Loitering around the
jewelry section, I see.

1024
01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:53.758
No. I was just
looking around.

1025
01:20:53.841 --> 01:20:56.675
Don't worry. My expectations
are not that high

1026
01:20:56.758 --> 01:21:00.258
after 13 years of
Mr. Oh-but-you-always-love-scarves.

1027
01:21:00.841 --> 01:21:02.800
Actually,
I do love this one.

1028
01:21:13.466 --> 01:21:14.508
Hey!

1029
01:21:14.591 --> 01:21:16.675
What are you doing here?

1030
01:21:17.175 --> 01:21:20.050
Had to rent out my flat
to pay for my ticket.

1031
01:21:20.133 --> 01:21:23.383
You're not actually going ahead
with this genuinely stupid plan?

1032
01:21:23.466 --> 01:21:25.258
Yeah. I bloody am.

1033
01:21:25.341 --> 01:21:28.758
You think this backpack
is full of clothes? Like hell it is.

1034
01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:31.549
It is chock-a-block
full of condoms.

1035
01:21:32.217 --> 01:21:35.466
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect, keep that going.

1036
01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:41.508
Look, sorry to be
a bit forward and all that,

1037
01:21:41.633 --> 01:21:44.175
but you don't fancy going
for a Christmas drink, do you?

1038
01:21:44.258 --> 01:21:46.424
I mean,
nothing implied at all.

1039
01:21:46.508 --> 01:21:51.466
Just maybe go and see
something Christmassy or something.

1040
01:21:51.591 --> 01:21:55.008
Obviously, if you don't want to,
you don't have to. I...

1041
01:21:55.092 --> 01:21:56.716
I'm rambling now, sorry.

1042
01:21:57.092 --> 01:21:59.633
No. That would be lovely.

1043
01:22:00.217 --> 01:22:02.508
Great.

1044
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.341
You know,
that is really great.

1045
01:22:08.424 --> 01:22:10.217
Normally, I'm really shy
about this sort of thing.

1046
01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:13.050
Takes me ages to get
the courage up, so thank you.

1047
01:22:19.675 --> 01:22:21.508
Explain to me again
why you're so late.

1048
01:22:21.591 --> 01:22:24.800
For heaven's sake, woman,
can't a man have any secrets?

1049
01:22:25.092 --> 01:22:29.133
We've been waiting for hours.
It's the first ever preview.

1050
01:22:37.925 --> 01:22:41.925
It was a starry night
in ancient Jerusalem

1051
01:22:42.008 --> 01:22:45.092
and the baby Jesus was
in his manger.

1052
01:22:53.508 --> 01:22:56.800
Sherlock Holmes is
not a real detective.

1053
01:23:00.258 --> 01:23:03.508
I would like
half-pint of sherry.

1054
01:23:04.424 --> 01:23:06.967
I would like
a one-day travel card.

1055
01:23:12.841 --> 01:23:15.967
Milton Keynes has
many roundabouts.

1056
01:23:39.383 --> 01:23:41.008
You'll come back
a broken man.

1057
01:23:41.092 --> 01:23:44.092
Yeah, back broken
from too much sex.

1058
01:23:44.175 --> 01:23:46.341
You are on
the road to disaster.

1059
01:23:46.424 --> 01:23:49.967
No, I am on shag highway,
heading west.

1060
01:23:50.466 --> 01:23:52.633
Farewell, failure.

1061
01:23:52.716 --> 01:23:56.466
America, watch out!
Here comes Colin Frissell.

1062
01:23:57.175 --> 01:24:00.549
And he's got a big knob.

1063
01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.092
Take me to a bar.

1064
01:24:12.175 --> 01:24:13.300
What kind of bar?

1065
01:24:13.383 --> 01:24:16.883
Just any bar. Just
your average American bar.

1066
01:24:24.341 --> 01:24:25.383
Can I help you?

1067
01:24:25.466 --> 01:24:27.883
Yes. I'd like a Budweiser,
please.

1068
01:24:27.967 --> 01:24:29.424
King of beers.

1069
01:24:29.508 --> 01:24:31.008
One Bud coming up.

1070
01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.633
Oh, my God.

1071
01:24:35.175 --> 01:24:36.800
Are you from England?

1072
01:24:37.925 --> 01:24:39.050
Yes.

1073
01:24:40.925 --> 01:24:43.633
That is so cute.

1074
01:24:43.716 --> 01:24:45.883
Hi, I'm Stacey.

1075
01:24:47.424 --> 01:24:49.424
Jeannie?

1076
01:24:51.591 --> 01:24:52.716
Yeah?

1077
01:24:53.591 --> 01:24:55.383
This is...

1078
01:24:55.466 --> 01:24:56.758
Colin.

1079
01:24:58.424 --> 01:25:00.383
Frissell.

1080
01:25:00.466 --> 01:25:02.258
Cute name.

1081
01:25:02.341 --> 01:25:04.008
Jeannie.

1082
01:25:04.092 --> 01:25:05.341
He's from England.

1083
01:25:05.424 --> 01:25:07.549
Yep. Basildon.

1084
01:25:10.383 --> 01:25:13.591
Wait till
Carol-Anne gets here.

1085
01:25:13.675 --> 01:25:15.591
She's crazy
about English guys.

1086
01:25:20.633 --> 01:25:22.008
Hey, girls.

1087
01:25:22.092 --> 01:25:24.508
Carol-Anne, come meet Colin.

1088
01:25:24.591 --> 01:25:26.092
He's from England.

1089
01:25:27.675 --> 01:25:31.758
Well, step aside, ladies.
This one's on me.

1090
01:25:34.466 --> 01:25:36.424
Hey, gorgeous.

1091
01:25:39.133 --> 01:25:40.716
That is so funny!

1092
01:25:42.383 --> 01:25:44.175
What do you call that?

1093
01:25:44.258 --> 01:25:45.508
Bottle.

1094
01:25:45.591 --> 01:25:47.050
Bottle.

1095
01:25:47.133 --> 01:25:49.092
- What about this?
- Straw.

1096
01:25:49.175 --> 01:25:50.925
Straw.

1097
01:25:51.008 --> 01:25:52.925
- What about this?
- Table.

1098
01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.258
- Table. The same.
- It's the same.

1099
01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:58.466
Where are you staying?

1100
01:25:58.549 --> 01:26:00.383
I don't actually know.

1101
01:26:00.466 --> 01:26:02.633
I guess I'll just check into a motel
like they do in the movies.

1102
01:26:02.716 --> 01:26:05.967
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, that is so cute.

1103
01:26:06.217 --> 01:26:10.508
No, no, no, listen. This may be
a bit pushy 'cause we just met you,

1104
01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.258
but why don't you come back
and sleep at our place?

1105
01:26:13.341 --> 01:26:15.424
Yeah.

1106
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.633
Well, I mean, you know, if it's not
too much of an inconvenience.

1107
01:26:18.716 --> 01:26:20.258
Hell no!

1108
01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:21.967
But there's one problem.

1109
01:26:22.508 --> 01:26:24.258
What?

1110
01:26:24.341 --> 01:26:27.633
Well, we're not the richest
of girls, you know.

1111
01:26:27.716 --> 01:26:32.466
So we just have
a little bed and no couch.

1112
01:26:32.675 --> 01:26:36.008
So you'd have to share
with all three of us.

1113
01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:42.508
And on this cold, cold night it's gonna be
crowded and sweaty and stuff.

1114
01:26:42.591 --> 01:26:45.508
And we can't even
afford pajamas.

1115
01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:47.050
No?

1116
01:26:48.050 --> 01:26:51.591
Which means
we would be naked.

1117
01:26:57.466 --> 01:26:59.300
No, no, I think it'd be fine.

1118
01:26:59.383 --> 01:27:00.383
- Great.
- Cool.

1119
01:27:01.841 --> 01:27:04.591
The thing that's gonna make
it more crowded...

1120
01:27:05.133 --> 01:27:07.217
Harriet.
You haven't met Harriet.

1121
01:27:07.675 --> 01:27:09.175
- There's a fourth one?
- Yeah.

1122
01:27:09.258 --> 01:27:13.300
Don't worry, you're totally gonna like her
'cause she is the sexy one.

1123
01:27:13.383 --> 01:27:16.217
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

1124
01:27:16.549 --> 01:27:18.591
Praise the Lord!

1125
01:27:18.675 --> 01:27:20.050
And he's a Christian.

1126
01:27:22.633 --> 01:27:24.300
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1127
01:27:45.217 --> 01:27:48.300
One present only each tonight.
Who's got one for Dad?

1128
01:27:48.383 --> 01:27:50.300
- I have.
- Let Mommy go first.

1129
01:27:50.383 --> 01:27:51.424
I'll get it. I'll get it.

1130
01:27:51.508 --> 01:27:53.424
No, no, no. I want to choose mine.
I want to choose mine.

1131
01:27:53.508 --> 01:27:55.716
I think I want

1132
01:27:57.967 --> 01:27:59.008
this one.

1133
01:27:59.092 --> 01:28:01.549
I have, of course, bought you
the traditional scarf as well,

1134
01:28:01.633 --> 01:28:05.383
but this is my other,
slightly special, personal one.

1135
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:08.092
Thank you.

1136
01:28:08.591 --> 01:28:10.341
That's a real first.

1137
01:28:10.424 --> 01:28:11.424
Rip it!

1138
01:28:11.508 --> 01:28:12.508
What is it?

1139
01:28:12.883 --> 01:28:15.591
I'm going to...
All right, I'll rip it.

1140
01:28:22.591 --> 01:28:24.925
God, that's a surprise.

1141
01:28:25.508 --> 01:28:27.217
What is it?

1142
01:28:29.424 --> 01:28:32.633
It's a CD.
Joni Mitchell.

1143
01:28:32.716 --> 01:28:35.300
To continue your
emotional education.

1144
01:28:35.383 --> 01:28:39.508
Yes. Goodness.

1145
01:28:40.424 --> 01:28:42.092
That's great.

1146
01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:44.591
My brilliant wife.

1147
01:28:44.675 --> 01:28:45.883
Yes.

1148
01:28:47.383 --> 01:28:51.716
Actually, do you mind if
I just absent myself for a second?

1149
01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.383
All that ice cream.

1150
01:28:55.008 --> 01:28:57.967
Darling, could you just make sure
the kids are ready to go?

1151
01:28:58.050 --> 01:28:59.466
I'll be back in a minute.

1152
01:28:59.549 --> 01:29:01.841
All right, all right,
let's take it easy.

1153
01:29:01.925 --> 01:29:03.591
Mine first. Mine.

1154
01:31:00.925 --> 01:31:02.466
Oh, my God.

1155
01:31:02.549 --> 01:31:05.466
It's a miracle.
You're all dressed.

1156
01:31:05.549 --> 01:31:08.466
Come on, come on, come on,
we're horribly late.

1157
01:31:08.549 --> 01:31:10.549
Right, then. Come on.
In the car. In the car.

1158
01:31:10.633 --> 01:31:11.967
Come on.

1159
01:31:22.133 --> 01:31:23.549
Has she noticed you yet?

1160
01:31:23.633 --> 01:31:25.258
No.

1161
01:31:25.549 --> 01:31:26.841
You know the thing
about romance is

1162
01:31:26.925 --> 01:31:29.591
people only get together
right at the very end.

1163
01:31:29.675 --> 01:31:31.800
Of course.

1164
01:31:33.466 --> 01:31:37.050
By the way, I feel bad.
I never ask you how your love life is going.

1165
01:31:39.383 --> 01:31:41.092
No.

1166
01:31:41.175 --> 01:31:44.008
As you know, that was
a done deal long ago.

1167
01:31:45.549 --> 01:31:48.092
Unless, of course,
Claudia Schiffer calls,

1168
01:31:48.175 --> 01:31:50.300
in which case I want you out of
the house straightaway,

1169
01:31:50.383 --> 01:31:52.424
you wee motherless mongrel.

1170
01:31:53.633 --> 01:31:58.217
No, no. We'll want to have
sex in every room, including yours.

1171
01:31:58.424 --> 01:32:00.800
It's a rainy
Christmas Eve all over the UK

1172
01:32:00.883 --> 01:32:03.258
and the big question
is who is number one

1173
01:32:03.341 --> 01:32:05.092
on the Radio One
chart show tonight?

1174
01:32:05.175 --> 01:32:09.258
Is it Blue or the unexpected
Christmas sensation from Billy Mack?

1175
01:32:09.549 --> 01:32:13.341
You might have guessed it,
although you may not believe it.

1176
01:32:13.424 --> 01:32:15.591
It's Billy Mack.

1177
01:32:18.341 --> 01:32:20.175
You are the champion!

1178
01:32:20.258 --> 01:32:21.633
Hi, Billy.

1179
01:32:21.716 --> 01:32:22.716
Hello.

1180
01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:26.341
We're live across the nation,
and you're number one.

1181
01:32:26.424 --> 01:32:27.967
How will you
be celebrating?

1182
01:32:28.050 --> 01:32:29.300
I don't know.

1183
01:32:29.383 --> 01:32:32.383
Either I could behave like
a real rock and roll loser

1184
01:32:32.508 --> 01:32:35.466
and get drunk
with my fat manager,

1185
01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:37.383
or, when I hang up,

1186
01:32:37.466 --> 01:32:42.383
I'll be flooded by invitations
to a large number of glamorous parties.

1187
01:32:42.633 --> 01:32:45.883
Let's hope it's the latter.
And here it is. Number one, from Billy Mack,

1188
01:32:45.967 --> 01:32:47.716
it's Christmas Is All Around.

1189
01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:50.008
Jesus, not that crap again.

1190
01:32:53.549 --> 01:32:55.925
Bill, it's for you, babe.

1191
01:32:56.633 --> 01:32:59.008
Hello. Elton.

1192
01:32:59.133 --> 01:33:02.383
Of course. Of course.

1193
01:33:02.466 --> 01:33:05.675
Send an embarrassingly
big car, and I'll be there.

1194
01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:11.549
It's gonna be
a very good Christmas.

1195
01:33:19.716 --> 01:33:20.758
Right.

1196
01:33:20.841 --> 01:33:23.591
I'd better be getting inside actually.
My mom and, you know...

1197
01:33:23.675 --> 01:33:26.466
Of course, yeah.
It's getting a bit cold.

1198
01:33:29.341 --> 01:33:30.841
Well, good night.

1199
01:33:30.925 --> 01:33:32.050
Night.

1200
01:33:41.925 --> 01:33:43.466
Okay.

1201
01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:01.591
All I want for Christmas
is you.

1202
01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:06.466
Right.

1203
01:34:06.549 --> 01:34:09.549
Thank you. Good.

1204
01:34:10.050 --> 01:34:11.300
Good night.

1205
01:34:25.549 --> 01:34:27.800
Look, everyone,
it's Uncle Jamie.

1206
01:34:27.883 --> 01:34:30.549
Hi, Uncle Jamie!

1207
01:34:30.633 --> 01:34:34.716
Yes, splendid.
It's lovely to see you all.

1208
01:34:35.508 --> 01:34:37.883
And...

1209
01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:40.591
I'm off, actually.

1210
01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:43.591
But, Jamie, darling...

1211
01:34:43.675 --> 01:34:45.925
Sorry.

1212
01:34:46.008 --> 01:34:48.549
Man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

1213
01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:53.466
I hate Uncle Jamie!

1214
01:34:53.549 --> 01:34:55.341
I hate Uncle Jamie.

1215
01:34:55.424 --> 01:34:57.050
I hate Uncle Jamie.

1216
01:35:08.341 --> 01:35:11.133
Gatwick Airport, please.
Fast as you can.

1217
01:35:26.258 --> 01:35:27.341
Night, Sarah.

1218
01:35:27.424 --> 01:35:28.925
Night, Karl.

1219
01:35:29.967 --> 01:35:31.967
I...

1220
01:35:36.383 --> 01:35:39.549
Merry Christmas.

1221
01:35:59.383 --> 01:36:02.258
Hi, babe.
How's it going? Yeah.

1222
01:36:02.591 --> 01:36:04.883
Is it all party, party,
party down there?

1223
01:36:23.633 --> 01:36:25.591
Sam, time for dinner.

1224
01:36:25.675 --> 01:36:26.925
I'm not hungry.

1225
01:36:27.008 --> 01:36:30.341
Sam, I've done
chicken kebabs.

1226
01:36:30.424 --> 01:36:32.508
Look at the sign
on the door.

1227
01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:38.050
Right.

1228
01:36:44.591 --> 01:36:47.217
It's a little long.

1229
01:36:55.466 --> 01:36:57.466
I'll get it.

1230
01:37:03.925 --> 01:37:05.341
Hi.

1231
01:37:05.424 --> 01:37:06.883
Who is it?

1232
01:37:11.549 --> 01:37:13.341
It's carol singers.

1233
01:37:13.549 --> 01:37:16.258
Give them a quid and
tell them to bugger off.

1234
01:38:28.383 --> 01:38:30.383
Merry Christmas.

1235
01:39:07.008 --> 01:39:08.466
Enough.

1236
01:39:09.758 --> 01:39:11.258
Enough now.

1237
01:39:20.008 --> 01:39:21.675
What the hell
are you doing here?

1238
01:39:21.758 --> 01:39:23.675
You're supposed to be
at Elton John's.

1239
01:39:23.758 --> 01:39:28.716
Well, I was there for a minute or two,
and then I had an epiphany.

1240
01:39:29.383 --> 01:39:31.549
- Really?
- Yeah.

1241
01:39:31.633 --> 01:39:33.633
Come on. Just come up.

1242
01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:36.967
So what was this epiphany?

1243
01:39:37.050 --> 01:39:39.675
It was about Christmas.

1244
01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:42.424
You realized
it was all around.

1245
01:39:42.508 --> 01:39:45.383
No. I realized that
Christmas is the time

1246
01:39:45.466 --> 01:39:47.383
to be with
the people you love.

1247
01:39:48.341 --> 01:39:49.549
Right.

1248
01:39:49.633 --> 01:39:52.883
And I realized that,
as dire chance

1249
01:39:52.967 --> 01:39:56.133
and fateful cock-up
would have it,

1250
01:39:56.217 --> 01:40:00.050
here I am, mid-50s,

1251
01:40:00.591 --> 01:40:03.675
and without knowing it, I've gone
and spent most of my adult life

1252
01:40:03.758 --> 01:40:06.133
with a chubby employee.

1253
01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.383
And, much as it
grieves me to say it,

1254
01:40:10.466 --> 01:40:16.258
it might be that the people
I love is, in fact,

1255
01:40:17.466 --> 01:40:18.466
you.

1256
01:40:21.591 --> 01:40:23.591
Well, this is a surprise.

1257
01:40:23.925 --> 01:40:25.508
Yeah.

1258
01:40:25.591 --> 01:40:28.008
Ten minutes at Elton John's,
you're as gay as a Maypole.

1259
01:40:28.092 --> 01:40:29.925
No, look.
I'm serious here.

1260
01:40:30.008 --> 01:40:31.841
I left Elton's
where there were

1261
01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:34.300
a hefty number of
half-naked chicks

1262
01:40:34.383 --> 01:40:39.383
with their mouths open in order to
hang out with you at Christmas.

1263
01:40:41.549 --> 01:40:42.925
Well, Bill...

1264
01:40:43.008 --> 01:40:46.883
It's a terrible,
terrible mistake, chubs,

1265
01:40:51.092 --> 01:40:54.341
but you turn out to be
the fucking love of my life.

1266
01:40:57.758 --> 01:41:01.466
And to be honest,
despite all my complaining,

1267
01:41:03.549 --> 01:41:05.925
we have had
a wonderful life.

1268
01:41:10.758 --> 01:41:12.424
Well,

1269
01:41:14.217 --> 01:41:15.925
thank you.

1270
01:41:17.841 --> 01:41:20.758
I mean, come on,
it's been an honor.

1271
01:41:23.092 --> 01:41:25.050
I feel very proud.

1272
01:41:25.133 --> 01:41:27.217
Look, don't be a moron.

1273
01:41:38.341 --> 01:41:41.424
Come on, let's get
pissed and watch porn.

1274
01:42:00.925 --> 01:42:03.383
Dear sir...
Dear David,

1275
01:42:03.466 --> 01:42:06.758
Merry Christmas and I hope you have
a very happy New Year.

1276
01:42:07.050 --> 01:42:09.383
I'm very sorry about
the thing that happened.

1277
01:42:09.466 --> 01:42:12.508
It was a very odd moment
and I feel like a prize idiot.

1278
01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:14.508
Particularly because,

1279
01:42:14.591 --> 01:42:17.341
if you can't say it at
Christmas when can you, eh,

1280
01:42:17.424 --> 01:42:21.050
I'm actually yours.
With love, your Natalie.

1281
01:42:41.424 --> 01:42:43.300
Jack, yeah, I need a car.

1282
01:42:43.383 --> 01:42:45.591
Right now. Thank you.

1283
01:42:57.383 --> 01:42:59.424
Don't wait up.

1284
01:43:03.383 --> 01:43:05.341
I'd like to go to Wandsworth,
the dodgy end.

1285
01:43:05.424 --> 01:43:06.883
Very good, sir.

1286
01:43:18.591 --> 01:43:21.300
Harris Street.
What number, sir?

1287
01:43:21.383 --> 01:43:24.092
God, it's the longest
street in the world,

1288
01:43:24.175 --> 01:43:26.050
and I have
absolutely no idea.

1289
01:43:34.633 --> 01:43:36.508
Hello.
Does Natalie live here?

1290
01:43:36.967 --> 01:43:38.050
No.

1291
01:43:38.133 --> 01:43:39.967
Right, fine.
Thank you. Sorry to disturb.

1292
01:43:40.050 --> 01:43:42.092
Hey, aren't...

1293
01:43:42.424 --> 01:43:45.383
Aren't you
the prime minister?

1294
01:43:45.466 --> 01:43:48.758
Yes. In fact, I am.
Merry Christmas.

1295
01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:51.508
Part of the service now.

1296
01:43:51.591 --> 01:43:53.675
Trying to get around to
everyone by New Year's Eve.

1297
01:43:59.383 --> 01:44:02.050
Hello.
Does Natalie live here?

1298
01:44:02.133 --> 01:44:03.258
No, she doesn't.

1299
01:44:03.341 --> 01:44:04.466
Oh, dear. Okay.

1300
01:44:04.549 --> 01:44:06.508
Are you singing carols?

1301
01:44:06.591 --> 01:44:07.758
No. No, I'm not.

1302
01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:09.591
Please, sir, please.

1303
01:44:09.675 --> 01:44:10.967
Please.

1304
01:44:14.050 --> 01:44:15.800
Well, I suppose I could.

1305
01:44:16.217 --> 01:44:17.800
Please.

1306
01:44:19.050 --> 01:44:20.466
All right.

1307
01:44:23.424 --> 01:44:26.758
<i>Good King Wenceslas
looked out</i>

1308
01:44:26.841 --> 01:44:30.508
<i>On the feast of Stephen</i>

1309
01:44:30.591 --> 01:44:33.675
<i>When the snow
lay round about</i>

1310
01:44:34.050 --> 01:44:37.341
<i>Deep and crisp and even</i>

1311
01:44:37.424 --> 01:44:41.008
<i>Brightly shone
the moon that night</i>

1312
01:44:42.341 --> 01:44:45.549
Hello. Sorry to disturb.
Does Natalie live here?

1313
01:44:45.633 --> 01:44:47.883
No. She lives next door.

1314
01:44:53.133 --> 01:44:54.466
Brilliant.

1315
01:44:54.549 --> 01:44:56.800
You're not who I think
you are, are you?

1316
01:44:56.883 --> 01:44:59.175
Yes, I'm afraid I am,
and I'm sorry about all the cock-ups.

1317
01:44:59.258 --> 01:45:01.341
Not my fault.
My cabinet are absolute crap.

1318
01:45:01.424 --> 01:45:04.967
We hope to do better next year.
Merry Christmas to you.

1319
01:45:22.424 --> 01:45:25.800
Hello. Is Natalie in?

1320
01:45:25.883 --> 01:45:28.675
Where the fuck
is my fucking coat?

1321
01:45:31.424 --> 01:45:34.424
Hello.

1322
01:45:34.508 --> 01:45:39.383
This is my mom and my dad and
my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.

1323
01:45:39.466 --> 01:45:41.300
Hello.
Very nice to meet you.

1324
01:45:41.758 --> 01:45:45.300
And this is
the prime minister.

1325
01:45:45.383 --> 01:45:48.383
Yes, we can see that,
darling.

1326
01:45:48.549 --> 01:45:51.008
And, unfortunately,
we're very late.

1327
01:45:51.092 --> 01:45:54.050
It's the school Christmas
concert, you see, David.

1328
01:45:54.341 --> 01:45:55.800
It's the first time
all the local schools

1329
01:45:55.883 --> 01:45:57.758
have joined together,
even St. Basil's...

1330
01:45:57.841 --> 01:45:59.092
Too much detail, Mom.

1331
01:45:59.175 --> 01:46:01.466
Anyway,
how can we help, sir?

1332
01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:05.549
Well, I just needed Natalie

1333
01:46:08.424 --> 01:46:10.383
on some state business.

1334
01:46:11.758 --> 01:46:16.883
Right, yes.
Of course. Right.

1335
01:46:16.967 --> 01:46:19.508
Well, perhaps you should
come on later, Plumpy.

1336
01:46:20.133 --> 01:46:21.258
Natalie.

1337
01:46:21.341 --> 01:46:23.633
Well, listen, I don't want to make
you late for the concert.

1338
01:46:23.716 --> 01:46:25.508
No, it's nothing, really.

1339
01:46:25.591 --> 01:46:27.050
Keith will be
very disappointed.

1340
01:46:27.133 --> 01:46:29.092
No, really,
it doesn't matter.

1341
01:46:29.175 --> 01:46:31.383
The octopus costume's
taken me months.

1342
01:46:31.758 --> 01:46:33.675
Eight is a lot
of legs, David.

1343
01:46:37.716 --> 01:46:40.092
Well, listen,
why don't I give you a lift,

1344
01:46:40.175 --> 01:46:45.092
and then we can talk about
this state business business in the car?

1345
01:46:47.508 --> 01:46:48.508
Okay.

1346
01:46:48.591 --> 01:46:50.341
- Lovely, yes.
- Lovely.

1347
01:46:50.424 --> 01:46:51.508
Thank you.

1348
01:46:51.591 --> 01:46:53.383
Hold tight, everybody.

1349
01:47:00.383 --> 01:47:01.549
How far is this place?

1350
01:47:01.633 --> 01:47:03.008
Just round the corner.

1351
01:47:03.092 --> 01:47:05.675
Right. Well...

1352
01:47:07.549 --> 01:47:09.716
I just wanted to say

1353
01:47:11.716 --> 01:47:13.758
thank you for
the Christmas card.

1354
01:47:14.175 --> 01:47:15.675
You're welcome.

1355
01:47:15.967 --> 01:47:18.008
Look, I'm so sorry
about that day.

1356
01:47:18.175 --> 01:47:19.883
I mean, I came into the room
and he slinked towards me

1357
01:47:19.967 --> 01:47:21.092
and there was a fire

1358
01:47:21.175 --> 01:47:22.758
and he's the President of
the United States

1359
01:47:22.841 --> 01:47:25.341
and nothing happened,
I promise.

1360
01:47:25.424 --> 01:47:28.424
And I just felt like
such a fool because

1361
01:47:28.925 --> 01:47:32.050
I think about you
all the time actually.

1362
01:47:32.466 --> 01:47:33.549
And I think you're
the man I really...

1363
01:47:33.633 --> 01:47:35.675
We're here.

1364
01:47:35.758 --> 01:47:37.341
- Love.
- Oh, wow.

1365
01:47:37.466 --> 01:47:40.008
That really was
just round the corner.

1366
01:47:55.424 --> 01:47:57.383
Well, look, I...

1367
01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:01.508
I think I'd better
not come in, you know?

1368
01:48:02.549 --> 01:48:06.092
Last thing anyone wants is some sleazy
politician stealing the kids' thunder.

1369
01:48:06.175 --> 01:48:09.800
No, please come.
It'll be great.

1370
01:48:10.341 --> 01:48:12.925
No, I'd...
I'd better not.

1371
01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:18.383
But I will be very sorry

1372
01:48:18.466 --> 01:48:20.508
to drive away from you.

1373
01:48:22.258 --> 01:48:24.383
Just give me one second.

1374
01:48:38.466 --> 01:48:41.466
John's been very mysterious.
Where did you two meet?

1375
01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:49.800
No!

1376
01:49:21.466 --> 01:49:24.133
Come on in.
We can watch from backstage.

1377
01:49:24.841 --> 01:49:26.967
Okay. Terry,
I won't be long.

1378
01:49:30.466 --> 01:49:33.466
Look, this has to be
a very secret visit, okay?

1379
01:49:33.549 --> 01:49:35.050
Don't worry.
This was my school.

1380
01:49:35.133 --> 01:49:37.133
I know my way around.
Come on.

1381
01:49:40.591 --> 01:49:43.341
Look, the sheep are ready already
and you're not even...

1382
01:49:43.424 --> 01:49:45.175
David.

1383
01:49:47.383 --> 01:49:49.633
How are you?

1384
01:49:50.008 --> 01:49:53.675
Hi, guys. Hey, hey, hey.
You all right?

1385
01:49:54.258 --> 01:49:56.383
What the hell
are you doing here?

1386
01:49:56.466 --> 01:49:57.466
Well, you know...

1387
01:49:57.549 --> 01:49:59.383
Well, I always tell your
secretary's secretary's secretary

1388
01:49:59.466 --> 01:50:02.300
that these things are going on,
but it never occurred to me

1389
01:50:02.383 --> 01:50:03.925
you'd actually turn up.

1390
01:50:04.008 --> 01:50:06.008
I thought it was
about time I did.

1391
01:50:06.092 --> 01:50:07.300
I just didn't
want anyone to see,

1392
01:50:07.383 --> 01:50:09.508
so I'm gonna hide myself
somewhere and watch the show.

1393
01:50:09.591 --> 01:50:12.217
Good luck, good luck, Daisy.
Good luck, Bernie.

1394
01:50:12.341 --> 01:50:15.841
I have to tell you, I've never been gladder
to see my stupid big brother.

1395
01:50:15.925 --> 01:50:17.092
Thank you.

1396
01:50:17.175 --> 01:50:18.466
All right.

1397
01:50:19.508 --> 01:50:22.092
Now, we haven't
been introduced.

1398
01:50:22.508 --> 01:50:25.383
Right.
Well, this is Gavin.

1399
01:50:25.466 --> 01:50:26.508
Hello, Gavin.

1400
01:50:26.591 --> 01:50:27.716
My copper.

1401
01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.758
And this is Natalie,
who's my...

1402
01:50:29.967 --> 01:50:32.508
Who's my
catering manager.

1403
01:50:33.258 --> 01:50:35.008
- Hi.
- Catering manager.

1404
01:50:35.092 --> 01:50:37.258
Watch out he keeps
his hands off you.

1405
01:50:37.341 --> 01:50:39.050
Twenty years ago,
you'd have been just his type.

1406
01:50:39.133 --> 01:50:42.800
I'll be very careful. Don't try something,
sir, just because it's Christmas.

1407
01:50:44.383 --> 01:50:45.383
No, seriously.

1408
01:50:46.591 --> 01:50:49.925
Come on. Showtime. Quickly.
Look, see you after, yeah?

1409
01:50:50.008 --> 01:50:51.466
Yeah, probably. Yeah.

1410
01:50:51.549 --> 01:50:53.633
Thank you, Prime Minister.

1411
01:50:53.716 --> 01:50:54.758
It's all right.

1412
01:50:54.841 --> 01:50:56.300
- Come on.
- Right.

1413
01:50:56.383 --> 01:51:00.508
<i>Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket</i>

1414
01:51:00.675 --> 01:51:05.008
<i>Save it for a rainy day</i>

1415
01:51:05.092 --> 01:51:08.967
<i>Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket</i>

1416
01:51:09.258 --> 01:51:12.549
<i>Never let it fade away</i>

1417
01:51:13.508 --> 01:51:17.424
<i>Never let it fade away</i>

1418
01:51:18.050 --> 01:51:22.967
<i>Never let it fade away</i>

1419
01:51:30.633 --> 01:51:32.217
Hillier School would
now like to present

1420
01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:34.175
their chosen
Christmas number.

1421
01:51:34.258 --> 01:51:37.258
Lead vocals by 10-year-old
Joanna Anderson,

1422
01:51:37.341 --> 01:51:42.133
backing vocals coordinated by her mother,
the great Mrs. Jean Anderson.

1423
01:51:42.549 --> 01:51:45.300
Some of the staff
have decided to help out,

1424
01:51:45.383 --> 01:51:49.675
and for this,
we ask you to forgive us.

1425
01:51:50.092 --> 01:51:51.633
Thank you.

1426
01:51:57.383 --> 01:52:01.258
<i>I don't want
a lot for Christmas</i>

1427
01:52:01.341 --> 01:52:05.383
<i>There's just one thing I need</i>

1428
01:52:05.466 --> 01:52:08.633
<i>I don't care
about the presents</i>

1429
01:52:09.008 --> 01:52:12.716
<i>Underneath
the Christmas tree</i>

1430
01:52:12.883 --> 01:52:16.383
<i>I just want you for my own</i>

1431
01:52:16.508 --> 01:52:20.383
<i>More than you
could ever know</i>

1432
01:52:20.466 --> 01:52:24.217
<i>Make my wish come true</i>

1433
01:52:24.383 --> 01:52:28.341
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1434
01:52:28.716 --> 01:52:35.716
<i>Is you</i>

1435
01:52:38.549 --> 01:52:41.300
<i>I don't want
a lot for Christmas</i>

1436
01:52:41.383 --> 01:52:44.549
<i>There's just

1437
01:52:44.883 --> 01:52:47.591

<i>Make my wish come true</i>

1442
01:53:00.508 --> 01:53:05.008
<i>All I want for Christmas
is you</i>

1443
01:53:06.633 --> 01:53:09.341
<i>You, baby</i>

1444
01:53:09.424 --> 01:53:12.967
<i>All the lights are shining</i>

1445
01:53:13.050 --> 01:53:16.967
<i>So brightly everywhere</i>

1446
01:53:17.133 --> 01:53:21.258
<i>And the sound of children's
laughter fills the air</i>

1447
01:53:21.341 --> 01:53:23.300
<i>Laughter fills the air</i>

1448
01:53:23.383 --> 01:53:25.217
<i>Everyone is singing</i>

1449
01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:26.300
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1450
01:53:26.383 --> 01:53:28.883
<i>I hear those
sleigh bells ringing</i>

1451
01:53:29.008 --> 01:53:31.591
<i>Santa,
won't you bring me my honey?</i>

1452
01:53:31.675 --> 01:53:35.217
<i>Won't you please
bring my baby to me?</i>

1453
01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:38.383
<i>I don't want
a lot for Christmas</i>

1454
01:53:38.466 --> 01:53:40.383
<i>This is all I'm asking for</i>

1455
01:53:40.466 --> 01:53:42.050
<i>All I'm asking for</i>

1456
01:53:42.133 --> 01:53:44.841
<i>I just wanna see my baby</i>

1457
01:53:44.925 --> 01:53:47.925
<i>Standing right
outside my door</i>

1458
01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:50.591
<i>'Cause I just
want you for my own</i>

1459
01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:52.716
<i>More than you
could ever know</i>

1460
01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.424
<i>You will ever know</i>

1461
01:53:54.508 --> 01:53:57.383
<i>Make my wish come true</i>

1462
01:53:57.466 --> 01:54:01.424
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1463
01:54:01.508 --> 01:54:05.175
<i>Is you</i>

1464
01:54:05.508 --> 01:54:07.716
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1465
01:54:07.967 --> 01:54:11.341
<i>And you and you</i>

1466
01:54:11.591 --> 01:54:12.841
<i>And you and you</i>

1467
01:54:12.925 --> 01:54:14.549
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1468
01:54:15.008 --> 01:54:18.383
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1469
01:54:35.092 --> 01:54:37.008
Right.

1470
01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:42.300
So, not quite as secret
as we'd hoped.

1471
01:54:42.383 --> 01:54:43.883
What do we do now?

1472
01:54:43.967 --> 01:54:45.008
Smile.

1473
01:54:45.675 --> 01:54:47.675
Little bow.

1474
01:54:51.175 --> 01:54:53.258
And a wave.

1475
01:55:06.925 --> 01:55:09.758
Absolutely no idea.
I mean, can you imagine?

1476
01:55:09.841 --> 01:55:11.841
I'll see you later,
all right?

1477
01:55:11.925 --> 01:55:14.008
I'll speak to you. Bye.

1478
01:55:16.841 --> 01:55:20.800
Tell me, if you were in my position,
what would you do?

1479
01:55:21.175 --> 01:55:23.092
What position is that?

1480
01:55:23.175 --> 01:55:26.967
Imagine your husband
bought a gold necklace

1481
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:30.050
and, come Christmas,
gave it to somebody else.

1482
01:55:30.258 --> 01:55:31.258
Karen...

1483
01:55:31.341 --> 01:55:32.591
Would you wait around
to find out...

1484
01:55:32.675 --> 01:55:33.675
Good night.

1485
01:55:33.758 --> 01:55:35.383
Night, darling.
Happy Christmas.

1486
01:55:35.466 --> 01:55:38.466
Would you wait around
to find out if it's just a necklace

1487
01:55:38.549 --> 01:55:41.008
or if it's sex
and a necklace

1488
01:55:41.092 --> 01:55:44.424
or if, worst of all,
it's a necklace and love?

1489
01:55:46.258 --> 01:55:47.466
Would you stay?

1490
01:55:47.549 --> 01:55:50.424
Knowing life would always be
a little bit worse?

1491
01:55:51.383 --> 01:55:52.383
Or would you cut and run?

1492
01:55:52.466 --> 01:55:54.675
Oh, God.

1493
01:55:59.508 --> 01:56:02.175
I am so in the wrong.

1494
01:56:02.341 --> 01:56:04.300
A classic fool.

1495
01:56:04.549 --> 01:56:07.591
Yes, but you've also
made a fool out of me.

1496
01:56:07.675 --> 01:56:10.424
You've made the life
I lead foolish too.

1497
01:56:12.883 --> 01:56:15.716
Darling. Darlings!

1498
01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:19.258
You were wonderful.

1499
01:56:19.341 --> 01:56:22.133
My little lobster,
you were so...

1500
01:56:22.217 --> 01:56:24.424
What is that word?

1501
01:56:24.591 --> 01:56:26.466
Orange.

1502
01:56:26.925 --> 01:56:29.883
Come on, I've got treats
at home. Dad's coming.

1503
01:56:31.424 --> 01:56:35.967
Sammy! Fantastic show!
Classic drumming, Son.

1504
01:56:36.341 --> 01:56:39.217
Thanks.
Plan didn't work though.

1505
01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:40.300
Tell her then.

1506
01:56:40.383 --> 01:56:42.466
- Tell her what?
- Tell her that you love her.

1507
01:56:42.549 --> 01:56:45.341
No way.
Anyway, they fly tonight.

1508
01:56:45.424 --> 01:56:48.883
Even better. Sam, you've got
nothing to lose,

1509
01:56:48.967 --> 01:56:51.466
and you'll always
regret it if you don't.

1510
01:56:52.591 --> 01:56:54.466
I never told
your mom enough.

1511
01:56:54.549 --> 01:56:55.967
I should have
told her every day,

1512
01:56:56.050 --> 01:56:58.841
because she was perfect
every day.

1513
01:57:00.258 --> 01:57:04.383
You've seen the films, kiddo.
It ain't over till it's over.

1514
01:57:06.591 --> 01:57:09.008
Okay, Dad. Let's do it.

1515
01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:11.341
Let's go get the shit
kicked out of us by love.

1516
01:57:11.424 --> 01:57:12.424
Yes.

1517
01:57:13.383 --> 01:57:14.591
Just give me one sec.

1518
01:57:14.675 --> 01:57:15.716
Yeah.

1519
01:57:17.175 --> 01:57:18.300
I'm sorry.

1520
01:57:18.383 --> 01:57:19.466
Sorry.

1521
01:57:20.508 --> 01:57:22.050
That's okay.

1522
01:57:22.133 --> 01:57:23.466
My fault.

1523
01:57:23.549 --> 01:57:25.217
No, no, really, it wasn't.

1524
01:57:25.967 --> 01:57:27.841
You're Sam's dad, aren't you?

1525
01:57:28.967 --> 01:57:31.716
Yeah. Stepdad actually.

1526
01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:34.800
- Daniel.
- I'm Carol.

1527
01:57:34.883 --> 01:57:36.591
Carol.

1528
01:57:36.841 --> 01:57:38.716
Okay, I'm back. Let's go.

1529
01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:41.300
Yeah. Well...

1530
01:57:42.383 --> 01:57:44.591
I hope we'll meet again,
Karen.

1531
01:57:44.883 --> 01:57:46.092
Carol.

1532
01:57:48.925 --> 01:57:50.716
I'll make sure we do.

1533
01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:52.716
Yeah? Good.

1534
01:58:01.424 --> 01:58:02.883
- Tell her.
- What?

1535
01:58:02.967 --> 01:58:04.424
You know...

1536
01:58:04.508 --> 01:58:06.424
Don't be such an arse.

1537
01:58:09.841 --> 01:58:11.841
- Look, there she is.
- Where?

1538
01:58:11.925 --> 01:58:13.424
Over there.

1539
01:58:16.050 --> 01:58:17.258
Oh, no.

1540
01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:21.841
It's okay, we'll go to the
airport. I know a shortcut.

1541
01:59:32.258 --> 01:59:34.258
Wait. Wait.

1542
01:59:37.466 --> 01:59:38.841
Oh, no.

1543
01:59:50.549 --> 01:59:51.841
Look,
we're not actually flying.

1544
01:59:51.925 --> 01:59:54.217
You can't come through
without a boarding pass.

1545
01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:58.591
Not even to let the boy say goodbye
to the love of his life?

1546
02:00:00.341 --> 02:00:01.424
No.

1547
02:00:04.466 --> 02:00:06.591
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- Boarding pass, sir?

1548
02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.383
Just a moment,
I know I've got it here somewhere.

1549
02:00:09.466 --> 02:00:11.508
Sorry. Would you mind
hanging on to that?

1550
02:00:11.591 --> 02:00:13.341
- Unless...
- What?

1551
02:00:13.424 --> 02:00:14.716
Do you want to
make a run for it?

1552
02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:16.175
Hold on to that, as well.

1553
02:00:16.258 --> 02:00:17.466
- You think I should?
- Yeah.

1554
02:00:17.549 --> 02:00:19.175
Thank you. Hold those.

1555
02:00:19.258 --> 02:00:21.300
Okay.

1556
02:00:21.383 --> 02:00:22.383
Yes!

1557
02:00:22.466 --> 02:00:25.466
No, I must have left them
where I was having a cup of coffee.

1558
02:00:25.549 --> 02:00:26.883
I'm sorry.

1559
02:02:18.758 --> 02:02:20.758
Joanna.

1560
02:02:21.841 --> 02:02:23.841
Sam?

1561
02:02:27.133 --> 02:02:28.925
I thought you
didn't know my name.

1562
02:02:29.008 --> 02:02:30.258
Course I do.

1563
02:02:31.549 --> 02:02:35.092
Oh, Jesus.
Here, I've gotta run.

1564
02:05:30.758 --> 02:05:32.758
Thank you.

1565
02:05:34.716 --> 02:05:36.716
That will be nice.

1566
02:05:38.841 --> 02:05:41.508
Yes is being my answer.

1567
02:05:43.925 --> 02:05:45.591
Easy question.

1568
02:05:52.258 --> 02:05:53.508
Bravo!

1569
02:06:20.133 --> 02:06:22.217
You learned English?

1570
02:06:22.633 --> 02:06:24.758
Just in cases.

1571
02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:07.633
Hello, Daisy.

1572
02:07:07.716 --> 02:07:09.424
This one's Greta.

1573
02:07:09.508 --> 02:07:10.508
Hello, Greta.

1574
02:07:12.508 --> 02:07:16.591
Here she is. This is Aurelia.
This is Juliet. This is Peter.

1575
02:07:16.716 --> 02:07:18.424
Mark, hi,
didn't see you there.

1576
02:07:18.508 --> 02:07:19.758
Yeah, just thought
I'd tag along.

1577
02:07:19.841 --> 02:07:22.633
Jamie's friends
are so good-looking.

1578
02:07:23.008 --> 02:07:25.175
He never tells me this.

1579
02:07:25.424 --> 02:07:28.300
I think maybe now
I have made the wrong choice,

1580
02:07:28.383 --> 02:07:30.175
picked wrong Englishman.

1581
02:07:30.258 --> 02:07:31.300
She can't speak
English properly.

1582
02:07:31.383 --> 02:07:33.300
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

1583
02:07:33.383 --> 02:07:35.466
Dad! Dad!

1584
02:07:37.466 --> 02:07:39.217
Oh, God.

1585
02:07:39.591 --> 02:07:40.591
Did you get us any presents?

1586
02:07:40.675 --> 02:07:42.591
As a matter of fact, I did.

1587
02:07:42.675 --> 02:07:44.300
Thanks, Dad.

1588
02:07:48.008 --> 02:07:49.175
How are you?

1589
02:07:49.258 --> 02:07:51.008
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1590
02:07:52.883 --> 02:07:54.841
Good to have you back.

1591
02:07:54.925 --> 02:07:57.258
Come on. Home.

1592
02:08:00.217 --> 02:08:02.217
There she is.

1593
02:08:03.716 --> 02:08:06.300
Hi.

1594
02:08:06.383 --> 02:08:07.549
Hello.

1595
02:08:07.633 --> 02:08:09.883
He should have kissed her.

1596
02:08:09.967 --> 02:08:11.508
No, that's cool.

1597
02:08:13.549 --> 02:08:16.092
Hey. What are you
two doing here?

1598
02:08:17.092 --> 02:08:18.341
I might get a shag at last.

1599
02:08:18.424 --> 02:08:19.675
Naughty.

1600
02:08:19.758 --> 02:08:20.758
Got to go.

1601
02:08:20.841 --> 02:08:22.175
Bye.

1602
02:08:27.883 --> 02:08:30.591
Now, this is Harriet.

1603
02:08:31.716 --> 02:08:34.716
Hi.
Really pleased to meet you.

1604
02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:36.341
Hello, Harriet.

1605
02:08:36.424 --> 02:08:40.424
I hope you don't mind,
I sort of brought my sister to stay.

1606
02:08:41.925 --> 02:08:46.383
This is Carla.
She's real friendly.

1607
02:08:46.967 --> 02:08:49.217
Hello, you must be Tony.

1608
02:08:50.508 --> 02:08:52.508
I heard you were gorgeous.

1609
02:09:05.133 --> 02:09:06.217
God, you weigh a lot.

1610
02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:07.508
Shut your face.
