00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:29,289
Hello.

2
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,442
Yes. As agreed,

3
00:00:31,453 --> 00:00:33,132
I'll be there in ten minutes.

4
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,893
OK. Give me 15.

6
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:15,212
I'm sorry I'm a bit late.

7
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:17,093
Yeah, well, sit down.

8
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:22,852
Well, I'd love to say that I'm happy
to see you all, but I'm not.

9
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:25,652
I never have meetings, I don't want
to have this one.

10
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:28,452
I need to know that what happened
last night won't happen again.

11
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:31,412
This has got to be closure. Well?

12
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:33,172
I think we've dealt with it.

13
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:34,852
Berna?

14
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:36,852
Last night we didn't ask Berna
to join us.

15
00:02:36,853 --> 00:02:38,892
- Why not?
- Because the problem wasn't her fault.

16
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,973
Spared the unpleasantness, was she?

17
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:45,652
So whose fault was it?

18
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:48,852
Laurie turned out to be religious
and was going to talk.

19
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:50,812
Did she know what she was
being paid for?

20
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:53,812
Not at first. But she was always
going to put two and two together.

21
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:55,892
At first she didn't want to take it.

22
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:57,812
She kept asking, "What am I being
paid for?"

23
00:02:57,813 --> 00:03:00,172
- And how much did you give her?
- A grand.

24
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:02,493
- Where is it?
- The grand?

25
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:04,250
Yes.

26
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:06,722
Erm, I don't know.

27
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,332
Looks like a loose end.

28
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,813
Not quite closure, is it?

29
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,732
Berna, they do a very good bacon
sandwich.

30
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,773
- No, thank you.
- No, really.

31
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:19,842
It's on me. You're not
religious, are you?

32
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:22,133
No, not me, Peter.

33
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:25,173
I'm secular. Secular, but not hungry.

34
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:29,852
So tell me, are there
any other loose ends?

35
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:32,412
There's a crazy entrepreneur
called Mikey Gowans.

36
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,092
He sends out drugs with pizza.

37
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:36,452
And was Mikey working alone?

38
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:39,772
I've stumbled on something else!

39
00:03:39,773 --> 00:03:41,253
Laurie was getting a cut.

40
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:42,308
Very religious!

41
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,695
She'd take Mikey's money but
she didn't want to take yours?

42
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:48,164
Well, that's the point we put to her.
In the back of the van, before...

43
00:03:48,175 --> 00:03:49,972
Everyone has red lines, don't they?

44
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:54,132
- Do they? You tell me, where are yours?
- The job was badly prepared.

45
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,453
On your side.

46
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,772
The Iraqi was taken out cleanly.

47
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,692
It was properly planned.

48
00:04:00,693 --> 00:04:03,732
Laurie was bungled at speed
and dumped down Shadwell way.

49
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:06,093
Not the same thing, is it?

50
00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:09,732
And what I'd really like to know is
where are the police in all this?

51
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,012
Berna?

52
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:13,012
What?

53
00:04:13,013 --> 00:04:15,292
Sometimes you've been able to help us.

54
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:18,812
- Help you how?
- With things you know that we don't,

55
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:22,212
in the past. Like when we closed
down the Bari route,

56
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:23,452
that was your tipoff.

57
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:25,972
Yes. In the Mediterranean.

58
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:28,253
Long way from Kennington.

59
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:32,893
Just remind me, what are your plans?

60
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:36,292
I'm going back to Izmir.

61
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:37,452
When?

62
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:39,132
Tomorrow,

63
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:41,653
to get new boats and find a new captain.

64
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,413
Good. Tomorrow?

65
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:47,092
Yes.

66
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:48,653
What time?

67
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:51,613
Later in the day.

68
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,612
From Gatwick.

69
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:59,093
At five.

70
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:04,692
Gentlemen, I can't pretend
I'm happy. I'm not.

71
00:05:04,693 --> 00:05:07,740
I'm not a gambler but I
recognise a streak of bad luck

72
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:10,068
when I see it and I don't like it.

73
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,092
Human transport's the gift
that keeps on giving,

74
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:14,852
or has until now. We're all rich men.

75
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:19,613
I came from the military
and I expect military standards.

76
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:22,612
And on your side?

77
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,412
What?

78
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:27,692
No, you just said, the planning
was bad on our side.

79
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:30,813
- Yeah?
- And now I can see you're worried.

80
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:33,213
So?

81
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,465
We all agree, the second
murder was messy,

82
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:39,606
but I'm asking, on your side?

83
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:43,212
The first murder. For instance,
the shooter -

84
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,893
everything OK?

85
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,212
I'll take care of the shooter.

86
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:52,813
The shooter's highly competent.
That's my business.

87
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:58,653
Gentlemen, thanks.

88
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:40,373
It's not good, is it?
It doesn't make any sense.

89
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:41,391
Why not?

90
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:43,420
Because everything's screaming
that the two murders

91
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,502
have got to be connected.

92
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:46,209
Got to be. So?

93
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,212
They're connected, but look at
them, they're completely different.

94
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:50,681
Laurie was beaten up,

95
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:53,252
smashed in the face, thrown
from a moving vehicle.

96
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:56,532
Does that sound like a woman's
doing? I don't think so.

97
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:58,292
We don't know the first one was a woman.

98
00:07:58,293 --> 00:08:00,732
- Don't we?
- All we've got is one stoned witness.

99
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,852
Whatever, don't you think it's the
exact opposite

100
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:06,172
of what we had on Monday?
Monday was clean and professional.

101
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:08,412
- This is careless.
- Maybe.

102
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:10,172
This is clumsy, Nathan.

103
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:12,892
It's lazy. Fuzz Gupta said there was
a military connection,

104
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,172
military ammunition.

105
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:16,372
Does this look like
a military killing to you?

106
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:18,572
- Look at this.
- What is it?

107
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:20,653
Evening Standard website.

108
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:24,892
Shit.

109
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:27,635
How many people were at the
interview in Harlsfleet last night?

110
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:28,655
Five.

111
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,772
Two being interviewed,
you, me and another.

112
00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:33,275
And somehow it's all over the news

113
00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:35,442
12 hours later that Asif wasn't Syrian.

114
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:38,572
He's Iraqi. And that means he was
an economic migrant.

115
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:40,815
And that means bad thing.
He's not an asylum seeker,

116
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:41,995
meaning good thing.

117
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:43,402
Someone's leaking.

118
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:45,452
Reads like they want to discredit
the victim.

119
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:48,252
Precisely. It's got to be
that wanker from Millbank.

120
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:49,292
Sam?

121
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:51,628
Ever get the feeling
you're being played?

122
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:54,132
- He'd never do that.
- Wouldn't he?

123
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,373
I know you've got a boycrush
on him. I haven't.

124
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:08,253
Come on, pick up!

125
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:12,292
- Berna?
- Westbourne's on to me.

126
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:14,573
We need to meet up urgently.

127
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:20,732
- Morning.
- Good morning.

128
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,292
How's your head?

129
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:23,653
Not too bad.

130
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:28,412
Good morning, ladies. Well, that was
one special evening, wasn't it?

131
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:31,852
Yes. I've got a terrible hangover, sir.

132
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:34,813
This regiment certainly knows
how to throw a party.

133
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,252
- Xan.
- Sandrine?

134
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:51,812
You're not due back today.

135
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:55,252
I know. II wondered if you could
give me some time.

136
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:57,012
Erm, yes.

137
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,372
I've got half an hour now
if that's any use.

138
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:00,893
Come on through.

139
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:05,772
III just think that people forget,
don't you?

140
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,892
Or perhaps they just don't want to know.

141
00:10:07,893 --> 00:10:11,652
Itit's like we've come back
and nobody wants to be reminded.

142
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,332
They would rather we stayed.

143
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,732
They think that we can go off and
fight wars and that somehow nothing

144
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,373
changes when we come home.

145
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:23,892
Last year, no British soldier
died in action overseas.

146
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:26,172
I mean, do you know
when that last happened?

147
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:27,812
It was 1968.

148
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:29,572
That's Afghanistan.

149
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:30,892
Libya. Iraq.

150
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:32,572
Kosovo. Bosnia. Sierra Leone.

151
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:33,972
The Gulf. The Falklands.

152
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:36,332
I mean, have I missed anything out?

153
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,613
Northern Ireland.

154
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:40,853
Of course.

155
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:44,852
My father fought there.

156
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,093
He was a hero?

157
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,653
He was...

158
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,413
a great hero.

159
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:59,453
Sandrine, what's this about?

160
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,332
I've got the feeling
something's happened.

161
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:06,012
Do you want to tell me about it?
Something in particular?

162
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,492
No, nothing. Nothing's happened.

163
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:09,653
Are you sure?

164
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:12,413
Then why did you come to see me?

165
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:16,013
There's no particular reason.

166
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:21,932
I think you should consider
taking a little time off.

167
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:24,092
I don't want to do that.

168
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:26,812
I have no life but the Army.

169
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:30,413
Yes, and that may be the reason you
should think about taking a break.

170
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:34,373
Do you still have family?

171
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:37,812
- My mother.
- OK.

172
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:39,652
Would you stay with her for a while?

173
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:41,213
What, is that an order, sir?

174
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:44,253
Not yet.

175
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,493
Coming back home, you...

176
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:57,333
you feel like a germ
that's entered the bloodstream.

177
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:11,813
It's open.

178
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:15,692
- You're back.
- Yes.

179
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,452
Nobody's been here at all.

180
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:18,932
No sign of Laurie all night.

181
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:21,532
I've been calling the social services.

182
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:25,093
No answers. Two hours of Johann Strauss.

183
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:28,933
Have you found Laurie?

184
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:31,693
I'm afraid we have.

185
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:49,053
OK, in you go.

186
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:52,573
OK, she's all yours.

187
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,852
Are you all right there, love?

188
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:57,893
Is it Mrs Stone?

189
00:13:10,213 --> 00:13:11,573
Karen!

190
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:15,652
You have to get up. You really have to.

191
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:16,693
Karen!

192
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:21,253
Karen!

193
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:24,212
Karen!

194
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:27,612
They want you out there sharpish
to give the nation your thoughts.

195
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,612
- OK.
- And also Genevieve rang.

196
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:31,066
Saying what?

197
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,409
- My cheques aren't big enough?
- No. Karen's still in bed

198
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,119
and somebody needs to take Lucy
to the hospital for her appointment.

199
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,568
Do I need to know all this stuff?

200
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:39,213
I mean, come on, it's perfectly obvious.

201
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:41,812
It's a bid for attention from
a woman I left seven years ago.

202
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:44,532
I'm sure. But what do you
want me to say?

203
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,532
A couple of days ago,
I made a wrong turn.

204
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:49,812
I had Suki Vincent in my bed
and I let her go.

205
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:52,372
Why did you do that, David?
It's not rational.

206
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,253
Tell that French au pair to get
my exwife out of bed.

207
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,253
What's your reaction to the
overnight news that Asif

208
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:00,347
wasn't in fact an asylum seeker?

209
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:02,692
OK, so he turned out to be
an economic migrant,

210
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:04,349
but that doesn't mean he wasn't entitled

211
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,166
to the full protection of the law.

212
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:07,852
But it is different, isn't it?

213
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:10,052
Can't we just say he was a human being,

214
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:12,452
who was shot down on a British street?

215
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:14,572
It doesn't matter where he came from.

216
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:17,654
We really are turning
into a nasty little country.

217
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:20,477
And isn't it time we had
an immigration policy

218
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:22,722
that wasn't just crass xenophobia?

219
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,412
II've been arguing for some time

220
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,692
that we need to fulfil our obligations,

221
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:29,172
and I'm not just talking
about moral obligations,

222
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:31,612
I'm talking about legal obligations -

223
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:35,132
promises that were made that we
seem conveniently to have forgotten.

224
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:38,652
Now, I believe that when the history
of this time comes to be written,

225
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:42,852
we will feel ashamed of how few
refugees we let in to this country

226
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:46,093
and how badly we treated them
when they were here.

227
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:49,893
Thank you, David, that's great.

228
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:56,572
You're having a marvellous run,
aren't you?

229
00:14:56,573 --> 00:14:58,213
Man shot down in the street,

230
00:14:58,224 --> 00:15:00,343
the next day spent looking
for a woman and you don't...

231
00:15:00,354 --> 00:15:02,366
- Where was she all day, by the way?
- We don't yet know.

232
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:05,385
You don't find her till she
turns up dead, it's brilliant.

233
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:07,332
Anyone else you got your sights on?

234
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,645
I think we should warn them,

235
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:10,922
don't you, since
you seem to be a bit of a kiss of death.

236
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:14,247
Aren't the first 24 hours meant to
be the best time to solve a crime,

237
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:16,004
not make it worse?

238
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,895
How many more are we planning to lose?

239
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:20,093
Have you anything to say?

240
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:23,372
So, let's sum up.

241
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:24,892
First murder -

242
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:27,372
a woman, perhaps, but you're not sure.

243
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:29,972
- Possibly.
- Perhaps with an army background.

244
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:32,252
We put a call into military police,
alerting them.

245
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:33,852
Anyone gone AWOL, anyone missing.

246
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:35,612
Some involvement, as yet unclear,

247
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:38,132
with refugee traffic and also
a drug distribution business.

248
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,887
I think we should be going after
Karen Mars.

249
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:40,906
Tell me why.

250
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:43,143
The killer has to know when and where
the pizza's going to be delivered.

251
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:44,995
How can it work unless
the killing's a setup?

252
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:46,642
- Kip?
- I don't agree.

253
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:49,278
Everyone at the pizza place knows
that Karen makes the same order,

254
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,602
same time every week.

255
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:52,812
And why? Cos the dope comes with it.

256
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:54,972
I'm sorry, but no one commits murder
for dope.

257
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:56,612
Not any dope I've ever smoked.

258
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:57,613
Nor me.

259
00:15:57,614 --> 00:15:59,331
What I want to know is,

260
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:02,683
does anybody really believe this
could be a British soldier?

261
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:05,132
Complicit in people smuggling?

262
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:08,453
Going out to kill a refugee
in the street?

263
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:09,906
I don't think so.

264
00:16:10,023 --> 00:16:12,212
So, second murder what's
the approach on that?

265
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:15,012
Laurie Stone's body was thrown
from a moving vehicle.

266
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:18,252
We're searching CCTV footage,
garages, approach roads,

267
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:20,012
we can do the car regs on ANPR.

268
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,052
We're searching the body for DNA traces.

269
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:24,692
Ranks off. You know what I find
especially annoying?

270
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,852
What annoys you?

271
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,657
All the while we're sat here

272
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:31,306
defining just how large a
Horlicks we're making,

273
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:34,572
there's a woman locked up in
Harlsfleet who knows all the answers.

274
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:36,572
Fatima Asif?

275
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:40,493
She knows everything.
But she's not speaking.

276
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:47,612
- What was all that about?
- What?

277
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:48,932
- That bit at the end?
- Nathan?

278
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,132
The Vietnamese girl's finally arrived.

279
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,373
- OK.
- She's brought along her vicar.

280
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:56,572
Rakhee, give them a call at Harlsfleet,

281
00:16:56,573 --> 00:16:58,612
get me another appointment
as soon as possible.

282
00:16:58,613 --> 00:17:00,533
- Sure.
- Don't tell anyone else.

283
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:11,412
Good.

284
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:14,132
We met on the pavement, remember?
You were pretty far gone.

285
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,772
We need you to go over your story,

286
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:18,172
every detail, and we need you
to work with a police artist

287
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:20,412
to give us an impression.
It's going to take time.

288
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:22,053
Is it all right if I come in with her?

289
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,748
Is she of age?

290
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,096
She is 23.

291
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:27,260
Then I don't think we're going to
need you, thanks for offering.

292
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:28,498
And I wouldn't hang around, either,

293
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:30,189
because this is going
to be a very long day.

294
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,772
Please remember,
she's doing this voluntarily.

295
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:35,412
No, she isn't. She was found
with a stash of drugs.

296
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:37,452
She's doing it because it's the law.

297
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:39,773
Miss Xuan Huy. Would you
like to step this way?

298
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:46,132
She's impossible.

299
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,212
- I'm sorry?
- My friend.

300
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:50,732
She means well
but she doesn't understand.

301
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,572
I got here from Vietnam.

302
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,332
I'm tougher than she thinks.

303
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,973
Yeah, that's my impression, too.

304
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:02,252
This isn't the best restaurant
in the town by any means,

305
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:04,292
but it is one of the nicest,

306
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:07,133
because they have tablecloths
and proper napkins.

307
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:10,893
I can't bear to eat without linen.

308
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:14,373
Do you know what you're having?

309
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:17,652
I always think steak is for men.

310
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:19,813
Your father ate steak.

311
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:22,093
I'd have fish.

312
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:25,413
Or macaroni cheese.

313
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:31,212
I still make macaroni.

314
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:32,973
Properly, not bought in.

315
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:35,893
Occasionally.

316
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:41,093
Now everyone's gone...

317
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,813
Yes.

318
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:52,013
I haven't cleared out
your brother's room.

319
00:18:53,573 --> 00:18:54,692
No?

320
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:56,413
I've left it.

321
00:18:58,493 --> 00:19:00,173
Well, I'm sure that's best.

322
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:05,933
I read a book about bereavement.

323
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:16,813
Don't do it until you feel you need to.

324
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,053
The regiment did nothing.

325
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,652
They sent me a letter first off.

326
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:30,612
I remember.

327
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:33,333
Then a visit from a lieutenant colonel.

328
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:37,853
His uniform was dirty.

329
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:41,812
He said he visited relatives all day.

330
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,413
That's his job.

331
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,293
- Had he known Michael?
- I couldn't say.

332
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,132
He died for nothing, didn't he?

333
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,813
Michael died fighting for his country.

334
00:19:57,693 --> 00:19:59,053
Yes.

335
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:03,613
May I take your order, please?

336
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:07,852
Have you decided what you want?

337
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:11,053
Yes, I'll have the... fish.

338
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:18,093
Your father had an interesting view.

339
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:23,372
He said if you left any institution
without bitterness,

340
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:25,332
it meant you'd beaten it.

341
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,573
If you were bitter,
the institution had won.

342
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:32,613
I know you.

343
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:37,652
I should think you'd be bored now
you're back from your tour.

344
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,772
Nothing to do.

345
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,252
You like doing.

346
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:43,813
I'm not bored.

347
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:46,933
Aimless, maybe.

348
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:51,653
I want to go back to the battlefront.

349
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:55,012
I'm not sure they'll let me.

350
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:57,612
- Why not?
- You know.

351
00:20:57,613 --> 00:21:01,452
Office politics. Who's in, who's out.

352
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:03,053
Are you out?

353
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,412
You know me, Mum,

354
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:07,813
I've never been in.

355
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:14,812
You've a lot to give, Sandrine.

356
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:16,573
Don't let it waste.

357
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,013
You haven't told me why you're here.

358
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:37,812
Today.

359
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:41,452
There's a man advising me at work,

360
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:44,653
who said perhaps I should
come home for a while.

361
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:49,813
I'm not sure I'd want that.

362
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,732
It's very kind of you, but...

363
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:56,172
you're an independent girl.

364
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:58,093
- Do you mind?
- No.

365
00:22:00,813 --> 00:22:03,493
Don't you think we should deal
with this separately?

366
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:07,413
I can't bear to be looked at.

367
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,492
By anyone.

368
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:13,373
I don't want my grief to be seen.

369
00:22:15,213 --> 00:22:18,133
- Of course, if you feel differently...
- No.

370
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,532
You must say if that's what you want.

371
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:23,453
No, I'll do something else.

372
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:44,219
- So it's agreed, yep?
- Suki,

373
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,962
you might want to come and see this.

374
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:48,372
Right, we'll talk later.

375
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:51,492
OK, so he turned out to be
an economic migrant,

376
00:22:51,493 --> 00:22:53,154
but that doesn't mean he wasn't entitled

377
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,882
to the full protection of the law.

378
00:22:54,893 --> 00:22:56,652
But it is different, isn't it?

379
00:22:56,653 --> 00:22:59,082
Can't we just say he was a human being

380
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:00,985
that was shot down on a British street?

381
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:02,612
It doesn't matter where he came from.

382
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:04,892
We really are turning into a nasty
little country.

383
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:07,492
- And isn't it time...
- Did he really just say that?

384
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:10,172
We had an immigration policy that
wasn't just crass xenophobia?

385
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:13,373
You know, the world is full of
decent honest people

386
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:15,502
just like you and me,
who want nothing more

387
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:17,374
than to make a decent
life for themselves.

388
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:18,932
Why can't we just admit that?

389
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:21,692
Now, I've been arguing for some time

390
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,396
that we need to fulfil our obligations,
and I'm not just talking...

391
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:27,236
- Was that about your brother?
- Yes.

392
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:30,812
I don't understand.

393
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:34,012
They kill my brother
and then they put me in prison.

394
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:37,372
It's not prison. Believe me,
prison's better than this.

395
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:39,292
In prison you know when you're
going to get out.

396
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,332
Ashamed of how few refugees we let
into this country

397
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,893
and how badly we treated them,
when they were here.

398
00:24:23,093 --> 00:24:26,253
Sandrine, where are you going?
Can I give you a lift?

399
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,772
How did you know where I was?

400
00:24:45,773 --> 00:24:47,493
I spoke to your mother.

401
00:24:50,493 --> 00:24:53,213
She and I talk most days
since your father died.

402
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:57,372
She told me where you were having lunch,

403
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:59,213
asked me to keep an eye out for you.

404
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:11,852
Peter, I'm not feeling great.

405
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:13,333
Can we stop and talk?

406
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:16,573
Yeah, sure.

407
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:24,972
Congratulations. You've really
pushed the envelope this time.

408
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,052
- Meaning?
- Deborah's off the scale.

409
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:28,372
Like I gave a damn.

410
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:30,132
- That interview.
- What about it?

411
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:33,078
I don't think she cared for you calling
Britain "a nasty little country."

412
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:35,053
God, did I say that?

413
00:25:35,064 --> 00:25:38,236
First thing tomorrow she's insisting
on a meeting. No excuses.

414
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:39,287
When?

415
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:41,092
- 5.30.
- 5.30?

416
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:42,492
Is she out of her mind?

417
00:25:42,493 --> 00:25:45,132
No, out of her bath at five
and prepped like an animal.

418
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:48,132
She's going to eat four men stronger
than you before breakfast.

419
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:50,489
And there's more bad news
from the grumpy French girl.

420
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,812
Karen still isn't up, and Genevieve
doesn't know what to do.

421
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:56,092
Right, that's it.
This time I'm going round.

422
00:25:56,093 --> 00:25:58,052
I'm going to sort this out,
once and for all.

423
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,333
Are you sure? Isn't that what she wants?

424
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:16,852
All right, tell me, is she still
in the bedroom?

425
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:18,972
She's not going to see you,
she's shut herself in.

426
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:21,653
Will you do me a favour and take
those fucking buds out your ears!?

427
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:26,572
Er, just so you know, there's
something else she's not telling you.

428
00:26:26,573 --> 00:26:28,652
- What?
- About the pizza.

429
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,733
What do I need to know about the pizza?

430
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:36,213
Karen! Karen!

431
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,572
Hi. David. I didn't know
you were coming round.

432
00:26:41,573 --> 00:26:44,492
I wasn't. But Genevieve called me
and said that you weren't getting up

433
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:46,692
and the baby needed to go to the
hospital.

434
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:49,572
I don't know what she's talking about.
The baby's fine. She's sleeping.

435
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:51,330
So she hasn't got a
doctor's appointment?

436
00:26:51,341 --> 00:26:52,925
I cancelled it. Come and have a drink.

437
00:26:52,936 --> 00:26:54,052
I don't want a drink!

438
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:57,012
And now she's telling me stuff
that II just can't believe.

439
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:59,052
Yeah, what sort of stuff is that?

440
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:00,813
About your pizza.

441
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,612
- What about my pizza?
- And what comes with it!

442
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:06,892
Christ, is that what this is about?

443
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:09,972
Whatwhat's wrong with drifting off
at the end of the day?

444
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:12,172
What, you're upset
because I smoked a bit of weed?

445
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:15,172
You like to stay stressed
in the evenings, don't you?

446
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:19,372
Talking politics with your friends
in M&S suits?!

447
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:22,172
I don't mind that you ordered dope
with your pizza, Karen.

448
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:25,196
What I do mind is if you fail to
mention the fact to the police!

449
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:26,548
Why? Why should I mention it?

450
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,318
Because I'm in the Shadow Cabinet,
that's why!

451
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:31,012
The police coming round
here to bust you!

452
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:32,954
Right, so this isn't about me

453
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:35,388
- this is about you!
- No, it isn't.

454
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:37,985
It's about honesty and
it is about principle!

455
00:27:37,996 --> 00:27:39,751
Principle. Principle, you mean like

456
00:27:39,762 --> 00:27:41,591
when you decided to fuck my best friend?

457
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:44,943
- That kind of principle?
- After I'd left you, Karen. After!

458
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:48,599
- Yeah, you left it a full three weeks!
- You were a fling,

459
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,092
she was a fling, so what?

460
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:52,212
Yes, but I was a fling
with a child, remember?

461
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,373
Who you never see!

462
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,932
No, Genevieve, you need to hear this,

463
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:58,892
cos she knows bloody well what this
is about.

464
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:01,252
You lost your job
and you didn't tell me.

465
00:28:01,253 --> 00:28:02,929
Well, why should I tell you?
Your words...

466
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,784
I was a fling so what
business is it of yours?

467
00:28:06,773 --> 00:28:10,172
Youyou don't even try to understand me.

468
00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:12,532
You don't know what it is I go through!

469
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:14,572
What is it that you go through?

470
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:16,372
No, really, I'm asking.

471
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:19,332
Because a lot of people grow up in a
war zone, a lot of people grow up

472
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,212
under fire, they lose their family,

473
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:22,955
they inherit a lot of
money which they try

474
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:25,162
their very best to get
through as fast as they can,

475
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:27,119
but they don't all deliberately fuck up

476
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,448
every situation that they walk into!

477
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,373
You're both heartless, the two of you.

478
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:37,024
You're loveless.

479
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:40,692
If you just stood by me, if
you just gave me some trust!

480
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:42,492
You're an addict, Karen.

481
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:44,732
You're an addict!

482
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:46,972
I know that, David.

483
00:28:46,973 --> 00:28:49,612
And it's all some crazy revenge on me.

484
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:50,956
You throw away your job...

485
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:52,996
I was working in a shop,
it's not so wonderful!

486
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:56,120
You throw away your life,
because you're so furious

487
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:57,707
that I don't love you.

488
00:28:57,853 --> 00:28:59,373
But I don't love you.

489
00:29:02,053 --> 00:29:03,493
I know that, too.

490
00:29:06,693 --> 00:29:08,092
I'm going to take Elfie away.

491
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:10,092
If this happens again. I mean it.

492
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:12,652
Yeah? Take her away.
Take her away to what?

493
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:16,292
You know, I keep reading
that you're a socialist, David.

494
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:17,852
So it says in the paper.

495
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:20,452
Aren't socialists meant to care
about other people?

496
00:29:20,453 --> 00:29:21,932
Aren't they meant to be committed?

497
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:25,892
The only thing you're committed to
is ducking and diving,

498
00:29:25,893 --> 00:29:27,572
never answering your phone,

499
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:28,892
lying about where you are.

500
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,492
You know, if you have a spare moment,

501
00:29:30,493 --> 00:29:32,127
I might introduce you to your daughter!

502
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,174
Three times

503
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:35,202
you said you'd take her to see
Beauty And The Beast at the cinema.

504
00:29:35,213 --> 00:29:37,653
Three times you've cancelled. When
are you going to take her, David?

505
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,290
Next year? The year after? Fuck!

506
00:29:43,813 --> 00:29:47,612
Well, you handled that brilliantly.

507
00:29:47,613 --> 00:29:49,293
Thank you.

508
00:29:57,493 --> 00:29:59,132
- I've been calling you.
- I know.

509
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:01,106
- I've been calling you over and over.
- Sandrine,

510
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:02,294
we had to be careful.

511
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:05,772
- So what's the answer?
- The answer is yes.

512
00:30:05,773 --> 00:30:07,092
Thank God.

513
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:09,172
I needed to be sure.

514
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:11,252
Asif pretended to be an asylum seeker.

515
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:13,532
He said he was Syrian. He wasn't.

516
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:16,812
You wanted to kill a terrorist
and you did.

517
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:18,373
- Are you sure?
- Certain.

518
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:21,373
Do you feel better?

519
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:24,053
No!

520
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:29,092
Peter, sometimes I'm frightened.

521
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:32,492
It's just so obvious.
They're trying to kill us,

522
00:30:32,493 --> 00:30:34,612
they're trying to take everything
from us.

523
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:36,692
It's a way of life they want to destroy.

524
00:30:36,693 --> 00:30:39,052
I'm beginning to think
they've already destroyed it.

525
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:41,812
I look around, and everyone's
carrying on as normal,

526
00:30:41,813 --> 00:30:43,532
but this isn't normal.

527
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,612
Is that what's upsetting you?

528
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:48,292
I'm trying to convince them
I need to go back.

529
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:50,933
I need to fight. But I'm not succeeding.

530
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:59,652
Your father was my best friend.

531
00:30:59,653 --> 00:31:01,252
We went everywhere together.

532
00:31:01,253 --> 00:31:04,052
- You know that.
- He said you saved his life.

533
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:07,012
Yeah, I did. In a street fight
in Londonderry.

534
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:08,933
He was a wonderful man.

535
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:12,753
But at a certain point,
even to him, I said,

536
00:31:12,764 --> 00:31:14,730
"Ralph, you have to let go."

537
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,013
"It's just a job."

538
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,048
I don't think I could do anything else.

539
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:20,627
You might have to.

540
00:31:21,573 --> 00:31:23,693
I'm saying that for your own good.

541
00:31:30,813 --> 00:31:33,612
There's a man at work
who's obsessing on me.

542
00:31:33,613 --> 00:31:35,452
Has he hurt you?

543
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:38,452
No, he's lowlevel.
He's lowlevel sexual scum.

544
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:40,172
If you need help, you let me know.

545
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:42,132
- No, I can handle him.
- Good.

546
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:45,292
Because I'm ready to kill anyone
who harms you

547
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:46,533
or your mother.

548
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,413
Thanks, Peter.

549
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:30,332
I think we're done with you, Linh.

550
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,972
Thank you very much. Are you OK?

551
00:32:31,973 --> 00:32:35,332
Yeah. Funny, actually - I feel
pretty good.

552
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,733
No reason you shouldn't.
You can go home now.

553
00:32:44,973 --> 00:32:46,413
Here.

554
00:32:48,493 --> 00:32:53,132
Well, I don't think we can put
this out, do you?

555
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:55,852
It's all a bit Crimewatch?

556
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:57,932
Do you know where Kip's gone?

557
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:59,853
No. She didn't say.

558
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:04,012
Nathan, someone called Sam Spence
phoned.

559
00:33:04,013 --> 00:33:05,493
Can you call him back?

560
00:33:46,013 --> 00:33:48,052
Sam.

561
00:33:48,053 --> 00:33:49,413
Berna.

562
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:52,773
You always said, didn't you?

563
00:33:52,784 --> 00:33:55,101
You always promised when
it got to the point

564
00:33:55,112 --> 00:33:58,242
where my life was in
danger, you'd take me out.

565
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:02,213
The second murder's a fuckup.

566
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:05,732
Who did it?

567
00:34:05,733 --> 00:34:07,533
Who do you think?

568
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:11,973
Your childhood friends?

569
00:34:14,173 --> 00:34:16,892
Don't get me wrong, they're butchers,

570
00:34:16,893 --> 00:34:20,172
but we grew up together
and that's why they trust me.

571
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:22,732
We had the same childhood in Kirikkale.

572
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:26,132
- Never been.
- Worst place on Earth.

573
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:28,333
We all came to England together.

574
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:33,533
Every morning we wake up and we're
not in Turkey, we're happy.

575
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:38,693
Face it, we made mistakes, you and me.

576
00:34:40,773 --> 00:34:42,493
You know what I'm talking about.

577
00:34:44,013 --> 00:34:46,772
- Bari.
- Yes, Bari.

578
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:48,492
Bari wasn't a mistake.

579
00:34:48,493 --> 00:34:50,092
I had no choice.

580
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:52,332
The Italian police had names.

581
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,572
They were going to send you to jail!

582
00:34:54,573 --> 00:34:56,133
I can't allow that.

583
00:34:58,653 --> 00:35:01,453
You and I have put five years into this.

584
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,492
Westbourne's on to me.

585
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:07,172
He called a meeting,
which he never does.

586
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:09,372
And every time, he brings up Bari.

587
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,772
How did I get the tipoff?

588
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:12,372
Well, did you tell him the story?

589
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:14,253
Yes. But he doesn't believe me.

590
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:18,293
- You're a good actress.
- Not good enough.

591
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:21,893
Do you know who did the pizza guy?

592
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:25,892
Westbourne's like you -
strictly needtoknow.

593
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:28,572
Gives nothing away.

594
00:35:28,573 --> 00:35:30,972
Clearly, it's going to depend
on the police.

595
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:32,213
Are they anywhere near?

596
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:35,572
Not last night they weren't.

597
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:37,413
Who's the investigating officer?

598
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:40,292
Kip Glaspie.

599
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:41,933
Used to be a teacher.

600
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,333
Her husband's head of a primary school.

601
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:49,252
Typical new intake.

602
00:35:49,253 --> 00:35:52,292
Feeling sorry for the people
they're meant to police.

603
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:54,012
Who's her boss?

604
00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:57,412
Jack Haley. PR man.

605
00:35:57,413 --> 00:35:59,493
It's not his fault.

606
00:35:59,915 --> 00:36:01,782
That's the job nowadays.

607
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:06,412
They're in the perception
business, like everyone else.

608
00:36:06,413 --> 00:36:09,732
But if they get close...

609
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:12,132
That's what I need, Sam.

610
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:14,852
I need police progress monitored.

611
00:36:14,853 --> 00:36:16,311
- Sure.
- Closely.

612
00:36:16,322 --> 00:36:17,339
Sure.

613
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,572
So that I know when
the net's drawing in.

614
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:21,972
And I need you to tell me as soon
as you know.

615
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:24,332
- It's going to save my life.
- Just...

616
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,213
trust me.

617
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:15,853
Sandrine?

618
00:37:41,253 --> 00:37:42,693
You're back!

619
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:46,293
I'm expecting the bishop.

620
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:50,332
How did it go?

621
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,292
- Fine.
- What, you helped them?

622
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:54,933
Yeah.

623
00:37:57,893 --> 00:37:59,532
I'm...

624
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:02,052
going to speak to David again.

625
00:38:02,053 --> 00:38:03,412
Don't speak to David.

626
00:38:03,413 --> 00:38:05,292
- Why not?
- I don't want it.

627
00:38:05,293 --> 00:38:07,812
But it was you who asked me
to speak to him!

628
00:38:07,813 --> 00:38:11,732
In your country everything's a deal,
who you know,

629
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:13,133
what they can do for you.

630
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:15,993
I'm not a beggar.

631
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:18,532
It isn't begging, Linh,
it's using the system.

632
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:20,972
What, you want to fix things
with your old boyfriend?

633
00:38:20,973 --> 00:38:22,413
He wasn't my boyfriend!

634
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:27,732
We were on some committee together,
we had some late nights - red wine,

635
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:31,053
too much selfpity,
but from both of us. That's all.

636
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:33,373
He's a mess.

637
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:36,893
It wasn't love.

638
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:42,932
I'd rather go home.

639
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:44,613
I want to be legal.

640
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:48,173
Am I allowed to say this?

641
00:38:49,213 --> 00:38:51,013
I'd like you to stay.

642
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:55,612
That's the bishop.

643
00:38:55,613 --> 00:38:57,812
- I'll get it.
- It's better you don't.

644
00:38:57,813 --> 00:38:59,693
No, Jane, it's better I do.

645
00:39:04,853 --> 00:39:06,572
- Bishop.
- Yes.

646
00:39:06,573 --> 00:39:09,132
- I'm Linh.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Linh.

647
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:10,932
I've heard a lot about you.

648
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,453
Come in.

649
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:19,493
Hello, Rufus. I've just made tea.

650
00:39:25,453 --> 00:39:27,452
I'll be upstairs.

651
00:39:27,453 --> 00:39:29,173
I hope I'll see you again.

652
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:37,372
You'd better get on with it, then.

653
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:41,052
Jane, you know what the issue is.

654
00:39:41,053 --> 00:39:43,612
I wrote you a formal letter, remember?

655
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:45,597
- I answered it.
- I know you did.

656
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:47,566
Your letter's on file. I have it.

657
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,452
So tell me, what's changed?

658
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:52,893
I'll tell you what's changed.

659
00:39:54,093 --> 00:39:57,692
The woman you live with has been
found with Class A drugs,

660
00:39:57,693 --> 00:40:00,772
on a pavement, in the middle
of the night.

661
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,133
And it appears she's overstaying
in the UK without permission.

662
00:40:05,293 --> 00:40:07,732
I'm a good priest, Rufus.

663
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:09,053
I know you are.

664
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:11,973
- Pastorally.
- I know what I'm doing.

665
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:14,813
I help people. I'm valuable.

666
00:40:16,253 --> 00:40:19,452
As for the rest of it, the private
stuff is unimportant.

667
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:21,172
- It's private.
- You can say that,

668
00:40:21,173 --> 00:40:23,252
it's me who has to deal
with the parishioners.

669
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:24,612
There are rules.

670
00:40:24,613 --> 00:40:25,972
And if you enforce those rules,

671
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:28,732
can you honestly say this parish
will be better off?

672
00:40:28,733 --> 00:40:30,932
Yeah, but that isn't the point.

673
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:34,892
Look, when we discussed this a few
months ago, you made me a promise.

674
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:37,012
It was a promise

675
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:40,812
that you wouldn't draw attention
to your arrangements.

676
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,892
You'd keep things lowkey.

677
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:46,412
And now, Linh's in newspapers
all over the parish.

678
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:48,332
Lowkey? I don't think so.

679
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,932
Our church is thriving here.

680
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:52,572
We're serving the poor.

681
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:56,173
Wewe're doing what Christ wanted us to.

682
00:40:57,733 --> 00:41:00,332
Does it really matter
if I sleep with a woman?

683
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,693
It matters if you're seen
to sleep with a woman!

684
00:41:04,013 --> 00:41:05,453
We had a deal, Jane.

685
00:41:06,493 --> 00:41:08,012
Did we?

686
00:41:08,013 --> 00:41:09,573
You know we did.

687
00:41:10,693 --> 00:41:14,812
You'll find it in Paul's Letter
to the Ephesians, or somewhere,

688
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:16,732
I don't care where.

689
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:21,012
"Do what you like, but for goodness'
sake, keep it to yourself."

690
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:24,130
As far as I'm concerned,

691
00:41:24,141 --> 00:41:25,748
that's Gospel.

692
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,012
I live with a man. You know that.

693
00:41:33,013 --> 00:41:34,253
I do.

694
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:38,212
He's my...

695
00:41:38,213 --> 00:41:39,852
companion.

696
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:41,692
Yes.

697
00:41:41,693 --> 00:41:45,532
When he comes to church,
John stands at the back.

698
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:48,532
We can sleep in the same bed,
church doesn't mind,

699
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:52,173
just as long as we don't touch
genitals, nobody objects.

700
00:41:55,653 --> 00:41:57,093
That's the rule.

701
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:02,372
Now, you can call it hypocrisy,

702
00:42:02,373 --> 00:42:04,292
I call it sensitivity.

703
00:42:04,293 --> 00:42:06,590
Rufus, people no longer
believe in institutions

704
00:42:06,601 --> 00:42:09,348
and it's for exactly the
reasons you're giving me.

705
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,692
Everything's fudge and falsity.

706
00:42:11,693 --> 00:42:14,452
Do you know, Jane, I believe
the opposite.

707
00:42:14,453 --> 00:42:16,718
It's only what you
call fudge and falsity

708
00:42:16,729 --> 00:42:18,522
which is holding things together at all.

709
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:23,052
I can't have a priest who openly
sleeps with a girlfriend

710
00:42:23,053 --> 00:42:27,493
who's an illegal immigrant and who's
found stoned in the street.

711
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:31,093
I can't have that.

712
00:42:32,773 --> 00:42:35,333
So what do you want me to do?

713
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:13,332
You're alone this time.

714
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,892
Yes.

715
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,252
The men are not with you.

716
00:43:17,253 --> 00:43:19,212
No.

717
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:21,533
Is there a reason for that?

718
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,093
I made a friend here called Gillian.

719
00:43:32,293 --> 00:43:33,852
I told her your name.

720
00:43:33,853 --> 00:43:36,493
She said Kip Glaspie, great athlete.

721
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:38,733
I wouldn't say great.

722
00:43:39,853 --> 00:43:42,493
On television, you fall on your back
and bounce.

723
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:48,252
It's famous footage.

724
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:50,372
Because it's painful to watch.

725
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:52,093
You hurt when you see it.

726
00:43:53,933 --> 00:43:55,813
Look, I'll show you. It's on my phone.

727
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:02,012
And here comes Great Britain's
Kip Glaspie for the pole vault.

728
00:44:02,013 --> 00:44:04,612
- Is that you?
- It certainly is.

729
00:44:04,613 --> 00:44:07,092
And here she comes for the approach...

730
00:44:07,093 --> 00:44:12,132
and... No she's down! My God!
She is down! That has got to hurt!

731
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:13,852
I think she might have bounced.

732
00:44:13,853 --> 00:44:16,133
- It's very funny.
- I know.

733
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:19,013
Why have it on your phone?

734
00:44:21,053 --> 00:44:25,332
Because, I don't know, it'll always
be something that happened to me.

735
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:27,452
What about you?

736
00:44:27,453 --> 00:44:29,372
I'm not famous for anything.

737
00:44:29,373 --> 00:44:32,733
No, I mean, what did you do, before?

738
00:44:34,013 --> 00:44:36,692
I wanted to study at Baghdad University.

739
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:38,212
Agronomy.

740
00:44:38,213 --> 00:44:39,533
Make the desert fertile.

741
00:44:41,093 --> 00:44:42,373
That was the plan.

742
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:45,133
But that wasn't possible.

743
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:48,773
Obviously, the Americans came in.

744
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:58,132
Gillian's lived here her whole life.

745
00:44:58,133 --> 00:44:59,813
Now they're throwing her out.

746
00:45:01,253 --> 00:45:03,572
She has no rights without papers.

747
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:07,453
- 30 years count for nothing.
- It happens.

748
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:10,612
It's always the same.

749
00:45:10,613 --> 00:45:13,293
People get picked up when they make
a mistake.

750
00:45:14,653 --> 00:45:16,373
What have you come to ask me today?

751
00:45:19,653 --> 00:45:22,172
I need those names.

752
00:45:22,173 --> 00:45:24,292
What are you offering me in return?

753
00:45:24,293 --> 00:45:26,441
Fatima, it must have occurred to you,

754
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:28,322
that even if you do get out of here,

755
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:31,132
there's no question of you
being able to stay in the UK,

756
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:33,252
because until we find your brother's
killer,

757
00:45:33,253 --> 00:45:34,892
you're never going to be safe.

758
00:45:34,893 --> 00:45:36,893
I know that.

759
00:45:37,088 --> 00:45:38,135
So?

760
00:45:38,588 --> 00:45:41,852
That's what Abdullah said when we
got here, the very same thing.

761
00:45:41,853 --> 00:45:43,253
We can never be safe.

762
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:46,812
Abdullah said that the smugglers
were bound to find us.

763
00:45:46,813 --> 00:45:48,413
Because you knew who they were?

764
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:51,733
Abdullah knew who the boss was.

765
00:45:53,213 --> 00:45:54,693
He wanted to make a deal.

766
00:45:55,893 --> 00:45:57,572
What was he? Crazy?

767
00:45:57,573 --> 00:45:58,812
No.

768
00:45:58,813 --> 00:46:00,693
Desperate.

769
00:46:03,373 --> 00:46:05,532
Mona's pregnant, did you guess?

770
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:07,412
I thought she might be.

771
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:08,933
Yeah.

772
00:46:10,293 --> 00:46:12,092
- How many months?
- Eight.

773
00:46:12,093 --> 00:46:13,493
And you?

774
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:16,493
Just six.

775
00:46:18,853 --> 00:46:20,413
Mona was raped.

776
00:46:21,733 --> 00:46:24,092
She was raped in Baghdad.

777
00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:25,692
It's a disgrace for our family.

778
00:46:25,693 --> 00:46:27,013
We had to leave.

779
00:46:28,013 --> 00:46:30,533
We cannot go back, whatever happens.

780
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:35,452
I told Abdullah. I told him over
and over,

781
00:46:35,453 --> 00:46:38,492
"England is a big country,
we can get lost."

782
00:46:38,493 --> 00:46:40,212
He said, "They'll find us."

783
00:46:40,213 --> 00:46:43,452
Did he find him? Did he find the boss?

784
00:46:43,453 --> 00:46:45,732
Fatima, you're being offered a chance.

785
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:47,372
Take it.

786
00:46:47,373 --> 00:46:49,492
There's no tape. There's no recording.

787
00:46:49,493 --> 00:46:51,053
This meeting never happened.

788
00:46:52,653 --> 00:46:54,692
Are you offering me residence?

789
00:46:54,693 --> 00:46:56,413
And for Mona?

790
00:46:57,733 --> 00:47:01,292
- You have to trust me.
- How can I trust you?

791
00:47:01,293 --> 00:47:03,692
- Do you have power?
- No.

792
00:47:03,693 --> 00:47:05,613
- Then...
- But I know people who do.

793
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:09,972
You have to trust the kind of person
I am.

794
00:47:09,973 --> 00:47:12,933
That's what it comes down to -
you have to look at me.

795
00:47:15,253 --> 00:47:16,973
It comes down to people.

796
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:30,533
Good.

797
00:47:31,853 --> 00:47:33,612
Then we're making a deal.

798
00:47:33,613 --> 00:47:35,052
Nathan, we've got an address,

799
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:36,932
I've texted you, The Newbury Hotel.

800
00:47:36,933 --> 00:47:40,372
I need uniformed officers, a
warrant, the whole fucking thing.

801
00:47:40,373 --> 00:47:41,813
I'll tell you later.

802
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:50,332
You're not going to like this.
She's rung again.

803
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,892
- Deborah?
- No.

804
00:47:51,893 --> 00:47:54,412
The au pair. She says
Karen never came back.

805
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,573
Do you have any idea where she is?

806
00:47:59,173 --> 00:48:00,572
Yeah.

807
00:48:00,573 --> 00:48:02,453
I can make a pretty good guess.

808
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:34,492
- How did you find me?
- Well, it's not the first time, is it?

809
00:48:34,493 --> 00:48:36,852
Look, I'ml'm on a roll, OK,
don't spoil it.

810
00:48:36,853 --> 00:48:37,893
I've had a great night.

811
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:43,372
David, I am on an incredible streak.

812
00:48:43,373 --> 00:48:44,772
This is... this is happening,

813
00:48:44,773 --> 00:48:48,332
OK, this, this is my chance
to put things right.

814
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:50,172
- Where did you get it?
- What?

815
00:48:50,173 --> 00:48:51,892
- The money.
- I'm winning.

816
00:48:51,893 --> 00:48:54,492
I know that. But where did you get
the original stake?

817
00:48:54,493 --> 00:48:57,812
You've been broke for months!
I had to pay off gangsters.

818
00:48:57,813 --> 00:49:00,539
- Russians!
- David, finally something goes right!

819
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,572
It goes right! Now just
let me have this spin.

820
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,502
A man gets shot on your doorstep

821
00:49:05,513 --> 00:49:07,643
and all of a sudden
you've got loads of cash?

822
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:10,092
And we're supposed to believe that
that's just coincidence, are we?

823
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:12,572
Do you really think that has
something to do with me?

824
00:49:12,573 --> 00:49:14,784
- Where did you get it?
- It's none of your business.

825
00:49:14,795 --> 00:49:15,948
Where did you get it?

826
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:17,492
- Come on.
- No, get off.

827
00:49:17,493 --> 00:49:19,412
- We're leaving! We are leaving!
- No, get off!

828
00:49:19,413 --> 00:49:21,492
- We are le...
- Just let go!

829
00:49:21,493 --> 00:49:23,572
- Stop!
- Karen...

830
00:49:23,573 --> 00:49:25,652
Fuck! Get off of me!

831
00:49:25,653 --> 00:49:27,052
- Get off!
- We are leaving.

832
00:49:27,053 --> 00:49:28,092
Get off!

833
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:30,973
Stop! Both leave now. Cash your chips.

834
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:45,252
- Kip, all right?
- Yeah.

835
00:49:45,253 --> 00:49:47,092
- We're all briefed?
- Yeah.

836
00:49:47,093 --> 00:49:48,133
Right, here we go.

837
00:50:04,853 --> 00:50:06,492
Yes, please, how can I help?

838
00:50:06,493 --> 00:50:08,652
We're looking to interview
some of your employees.

839
00:50:08,653 --> 00:50:12,092
I don't think that's going to be
possible.

840
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:14,972
OK. Well, then, we'll go out and
come back in through the front.

841
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:17,213
Loudly. Lots of glasses knocked over.

842
00:50:21,613 --> 00:50:23,412
I hope you have authorisation.

843
00:50:23,413 --> 00:50:26,612
- Who's got the warrant?
- Let's go.

844
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:29,453
You had someone working here
called Fatima Asif.

845
00:50:31,373 --> 00:50:33,012
Everyone here is freelance.

846
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:35,933
Don't bullshit me, you know who
I'm talking about. She has a locker.

847
00:50:37,213 --> 00:50:39,932
I can't open it for you
if that's what you want.

848
00:50:39,933 --> 00:50:42,172
OK, just to be clear,
we're going to charge you,

849
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:43,772
for employing illegal immigrants.

850
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:45,932
We don't do any such thing.

851
00:50:45,933 --> 00:50:48,452
No? We'll start interviews.

852
00:50:48,453 --> 00:50:51,012
In an hour you may find
you have no staff at all.

853
00:50:51,013 --> 00:50:53,373
You'll be cleaning the fucking
toilets on your own.

854
00:51:13,973 --> 00:51:16,252
What is this? Cleaning materials?

855
00:51:16,253 --> 00:51:18,492
They provide their own.

856
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,932
- Out of their wages?
- They're selfemployed.

857
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:22,932
They don't have to work here.

858
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:24,653
Get the fuck out.

859
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:36,168
Fatima's phone.

860
00:51:45,363 --> 00:51:46,682
Do you want a lift?

861
00:51:46,683 --> 00:51:48,943
- She had that all along?
- Yeah, but she'd hidden it.

862
00:51:48,954 --> 00:51:51,719
- Yeah, I know she'd hidden it.
- She didn't want to have it on her.

863
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,398
- Yeah, I know that.
- Too big a risk.

864
00:51:53,399 --> 00:51:55,968
Kip, you may be a flyer but I'm not
as stupid as you think I am.

865
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:58,192
- I don't think you're stupid.
- You went down to Harlsfleet

866
00:51:58,203 --> 00:52:00,045
without me.
You made her a promise, didn't you?

867
00:52:00,056 --> 00:52:02,111
- I went down to talk to her.
- I know how you did this.

868
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:04,331
- Come on, Nathan.
- I know what you did. Fuck you, Kip.

869
00:52:04,342 --> 00:52:06,582
Fuck you and your methods.
This is how it is with you.

870
00:52:06,593 --> 00:52:08,506
It's always on your own terms
and fuck everyone else.

871
00:52:08,517 --> 00:52:10,671
- Nathan!
- No, fuck you, Kip! Fuck you!

872
00:52:45,134 --> 00:52:48,011
Kip, I found you.
I've been trying all day.

873
00:52:48,012 --> 00:52:49,850
Yeah, I'm not going to make it.

874
00:52:49,851 --> 00:52:52,609
I need to work. I need to think
and to work.

875
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,488
That's the third night in a row!

876
00:52:54,489 --> 00:52:56,087
I know. I'm sorry.

877
00:52:56,088 --> 00:52:58,526
Are you all right? I'm worried.
Is something upsetting you?

878
00:52:58,527 --> 00:53:00,885
I promise it's fine.
I'd say if it wasn't.

879
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,125
I know, I know you would.

880
00:53:03,924 --> 00:53:05,684
Look after yourself.

881
00:53:19,277 --> 00:53:20,996
Where is your money?

882
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:27,313
Hello.

883
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:37,268
No, no, no - 3,000 euro each. 3,000
for you and 3,000 for your wife.

884
00:53:42,545 --> 00:53:44,784
They're now on the boat.
