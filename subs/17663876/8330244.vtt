-This is nothing.

1449
01:33:32.581 --> 01:33:35.049
Did I ever tell you
how hot Iraq gets?

1450
01:33:36.617 --> 01:33:40.154
130. And I'm not talking
like two days a year.

1451
01:33:40.254 --> 01:33:43.090
I'm talking about every
single day. 130 degrees.

You can literally
fry an egg on a rock.

1453
01:33:45.092 --> 01:33:47.094
You could have eggs all --
as many as you want.

1454
01:33:47.194 --> 01:33:50.664
If you carried eggs around Iraq,
you know,

1455
01:33:50.764 --> 01:33:52.666
you had a dozen eggs
for the day, you know,

1456
01:33:52.766 --> 01:33:55.169
and, uh, you were just
walking around Iraq,

1457
01:33:55.269 --> 01:33:58.739
you could literally fry up
an egg every single hour

1458
01:33:58.839 --> 01:34:00.674
and have an egg, fried egg,
every single hour.

1459
01:34:00.774 --> 01:34:02.309
You'd just throw it
on the ground --

1460
01:34:02.409 --> 01:34:04.044
boom, you got a fried egg.

1461
01:34:04.145 --> 01:34:06.180
If you carried some, you know,
rice and some beans,

1462
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.183
you'd have a little taco.

1463
01:34:09.283 --> 01:34:12.119
I mean, not that you would
actually wanna eat it.

1464

Well, <i>you</i> actually might.
