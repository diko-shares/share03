00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:20.908
[introductory music]

2
00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:28.141
Fuck you!

3
00:02:02.092 --> 00:02:04.052
Whew. It's hot out there today.

4
00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:07.723
It's no Iraq.

5
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.271
I know I've said it before,
but it's so hot there

6
00:02:14.354 --> 00:02:16.273
you can literally fry an egg on a rock.

7
00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:17.357
Literally.

8
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.403
Literally.

9
00:02:22.613 --> 00:02:23.697
That's a funny word, huh?

10
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.532
It means the opposite of figurative,

11
00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:28.035
but now it's a synonym.

12
00:02:30.537 --> 00:02:33.790
What? I mean, it's not the worst thing,

13
00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:36.627
but you gotta admit
that when a word that means

14
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.837
something so concrete can actually now mean

15
00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:45.052
the exact opposite, that's--
that's nuts, right?

16
00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:46.887
Like, something weird is going on.

17
00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.390
Something weird, man.

18
00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:53.977
You know what I heard
the other day? Huh?

19
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:56.438
You'll think this is hilarious. It's so messed up.

20
00:02:56.521 --> 00:03:00.108
Apparently, they sell chairs now

21
00:03:00.192 --> 00:03:01.860
designed to feel like they're hugging you.

22
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.987
You see what I'm saying?

23
00:03:04.071 --> 00:03:05.906
I don't mean that figuratively,
I mean that literally.

24
00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.909
They literally feel like they're hugging you.

25
00:03:08.992 --> 00:03:10.494
They've got these...

26
00:03:10.577 --> 00:03:12.955
I don't know, like they have
long fuzzy dangling arms,

27
00:03:13.038 --> 00:03:14.915
they wrap around you to make you feel good.

28
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:20.587
What is that?

29
00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:21.713
I'll tell you what it is.

30
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.174
It's loneliness, man.

31
00:03:28.095 --> 00:03:29.638
People don't know how to be lonely.

32
00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:33.225
Hey, officer.

33
00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:36.478
Hey.

34
00:03:36.561 --> 00:03:37.646
Looking good.

35
00:03:44.152 --> 00:03:45.988
Failure to...

36
00:03:46.071 --> 00:03:48.824
there you go, failure to yield.

37
00:03:48.907 --> 00:03:50.367
Smart man, 1-Adam-12.

38
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.202
Driver's roughly 6-foot...

39
00:03:52.285 --> 00:03:53.328
Skip that paperwork.

40
00:03:53.412 --> 00:03:54.454
Requesting K-9.

41
00:03:54.538 --> 00:03:56.164
Ohh, now you got paperwork, bro.

42
00:03:56.248 --> 00:03:58.500
10-57 Foxtrot. 612 Crocker.

43
00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:00.669
Repeat, 612 Crocker. Requesting K-9.

44
00:04:00.752 --> 00:04:01.962
This is King 1. Show me en route.

45
00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:03.046
10-9 that location.

46
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.381
Okay, 612 Crocker.

47
00:04:04.464 --> 00:04:06.216
- King 1 en route.
- 10-4.

48
00:04:09.553 --> 00:04:10.929
What do you say, bud?

49
00:05:03.815 --> 00:05:05.400
Dude rolled a stop.

50
00:05:05.484 --> 00:05:06.943
Tried pullin’ him over.

51
00:05:07.027 --> 00:05:09.029
He started driving like a bat out of hell.

52
00:05:09.112 --> 00:05:11.490
Jumped the curb here
and took off running that way.

53
00:05:11.573 --> 00:05:13.033
Dangerous?

54
00:05:13.116 --> 00:05:14.242
- Eh.
- The fuck

55
00:05:14.326 --> 00:05:15.494
took you so long, man?

56
00:05:15.577 --> 00:05:17.537
You walk your fucking dog over here?

57
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:19.664
I'll get him out. You can ask him yourself.

58
00:05:23.835 --> 00:05:25.045
Hasn't been reported stolen.

59
00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:28.423
Something tells me we're now looking for a...

60
00:05:28.507 --> 00:05:32.094
some Chinese X...I...A.

61
00:05:32.177 --> 00:05:33.220
Hernandez, you got this, buddy.

62
00:05:33.303 --> 00:05:34.221
Now, what's the rule?

63
00:05:34.304 --> 00:05:36.973
I before E except after C senor.

64
00:05:37.057 --> 00:05:38.350
You got a description?

65
00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:40.769
Average height. Hispanic. Skinny.

66
00:05:40.852 --> 00:05:42.771
Definitely not Chinese.

67
00:05:42.854 --> 00:05:46.274
Probably undocumented.
Got spooked and ran.

68
00:05:46.358 --> 00:05:48.652
My man Dante over here got a look.

69
00:05:48.735 --> 00:05:50.320
Seems credible.

70
00:05:50.403 --> 00:05:51.530
Solid.

71
00:05:51.613 --> 00:05:53.031
Dante's all right.

72
00:05:53.115 --> 00:05:56.326
Knows everything on these streets.

73
00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:57.702
All right. Give me a sec.

74
00:06:06.837 --> 00:06:08.171
All right. It's time for.

75
00:06:22.644 --> 00:06:23.603
Ace, Such. Such.

76
00:06:23.687 --> 00:06:24.771
Such.

77
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.444
Ace, Such.

78
00:06:31.528 --> 00:06:32.946
Ace, come on.

79
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:34.948
Such.

80
00:06:37.534 --> 00:06:38.451
Good.

81
00:06:38.535 --> 00:06:39.536
You got drugs.

82
00:06:42.247 --> 00:06:44.291
1-Adam-12 requesting backup.

83
00:06:44.374 --> 00:06:45.584
Copy that, 1-Adam-12.

84
00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:48.295
Sending backup to 02.

85
00:06:48.378 --> 00:06:50.964
Got 1-Adam-12.

86
00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:55.010
Bingo.

87
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.847
Such.

88
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.182
Such.

89
00:07:00.265 --> 00:07:01.433
Such.

90
00:07:01.516 --> 00:07:03.351
Come on.

91
00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:05.020
- Such.
- Get out of there now!

92
00:07:05.103 --> 00:07:06.021
Such.

93
00:07:08.023 --> 00:07:10.650
Back there, it's justa buncha animals in there...

94
00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:12.027
No place for animals.

95
00:07:20.327 --> 00:07:21.328
Ah shit!

96
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.207
How are we supposed to clean
their shit off the street

97
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.083
if we can't even get their shit off the street?

98
00:07:29.085 --> 00:07:30.378
Damn, whatever!

99
00:07:33.924 --> 00:07:35.133
Greene!

100
00:07:35.217 --> 00:07:37.052
Make sure no one wanders the fuck over here!

101
00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:46.144
Hey, LAPD, man.

102
00:07:46.228 --> 00:07:47.437
Hey, we just want to talk.

103
00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:52.859
All right, okay. I've got a dog.

104
00:07:52.943 --> 00:07:57.530
We just wanna resolve this without anybody getting hurt.

105
00:08:02.994 --> 00:08:04.246
Shots fired! I repeat, shots fired!

106
00:08:04.329 --> 00:08:05.497
Where's my backup?

107
00:08:08.416 --> 00:08:09.751
- Are you hit?
- No, I'm okay.

108
00:08:12.295 --> 00:08:13.922
No! Don't touch that!

109
00:08:25.684 --> 00:08:26.643
Come, Faas! Faas!

110
00:08:30.188 --> 00:08:31.189
Ace!

111
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.608
Just pull back.

112
00:08:33.692 --> 00:08:35.151
- Wait for backup!
- Son of a bitch.

113
00:08:35.235 --> 00:08:36.570
He put glass on the ground.

114
00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:39.114
Let me look at you. Come here.

115
00:08:40.448 --> 00:08:41.950
You're okay, huh?

116
00:08:42.033 --> 00:08:43.118
Yeah. All right. Let's go.

117
00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:44.119
Geh Rein.

118
00:08:47.205 --> 00:08:50.959
Officer down.

119
00:09:25.243 --> 00:09:26.244
You good?

120
00:09:26.328 --> 00:09:28.038
Huh? Okay.

121
00:09:30.165 --> 00:09:31.333
Geh Rein.

122
00:09:39.132 --> 00:09:40.717
Show me your hands!

123
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.010
Ace, Lass.

124
00:09:42.093 --> 00:09:43.803
Lass.

125
00:09:46.973 --> 00:09:49.559
Who gave you this jacket?

126
00:09:49.642 --> 00:09:50.810
Where'd they go?

127
00:09:50.894 --> 00:09:51.811
Legen!

128
00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.608
Hey!

129
00:09:56.691 --> 00:09:58.526
Hey! Get on the ground!

130
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.819
Drop the gun!

131
00:10:04.908 --> 00:10:05.950
Ahh!

132
00:10:19.464 --> 00:10:21.174
Ace!

133
00:10:21.257 --> 00:10:22.759
Ace!

134
00:10:25.345 --> 00:10:27.055
Ace!

135
00:10:48.284 --> 00:10:51.121
Officer down!

136
00:10:51.204 --> 00:10:52.372
Officer down!

137
00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:56.459
Now spin right.

138
00:10:57.627 --> 00:10:58.545
Hey!

139
00:10:58.628 --> 00:11:00.004
This officer needs attention.

140
00:11:00.088 --> 00:11:01.214
We heard you, man!

141
00:11:01.297 --> 00:11:03.383
We'll get to your dog.

142
00:11:03.466 --> 00:11:05.718
He's a police officer, so he needs help.

143
00:11:05.802 --> 00:11:06.803
Now.

144
00:11:06.886 --> 00:11:08.930
People first. Okay?

145
00:11:18.231 --> 00:11:19.149
Get your fucking hands...

146
00:11:20.567 --> 00:11:22.485
Jake! Come on! Come on!

147
00:11:22.569 --> 00:11:24.487
Jake! Come on!

148
00:11:28.658 --> 00:11:30.452
LAPD to King 1.

149
00:11:32.078 --> 00:11:33.955
LAPD to King 1.

150
00:11:36.416 --> 00:11:38.460
LAPD to King 1?

151
00:11:40.044 --> 00:11:42.630
K-9 Ace is 10-7.

152
00:11:42.714 --> 00:11:44.674
Gone but never forgotten.

153
00:11:44.757 --> 00:11:46.843
Rest in peace, dear friend,

154
00:11:46.926 --> 00:11:48.511
and protect us from above.

155
00:11:51.306 --> 00:11:52.891
We are here today

156
00:11:52.974 --> 00:11:57.228
to remember a true hero--
in every sense of the word.

157
00:11:57.312 --> 00:11:59.898
Ace was not only a great police K-9,

158
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:04.736
but was also a loyal partner of Officer Jake Rosser.

159
00:12:04.819 --> 00:12:08.364
His unwavering bravery will never be forgotten.

160
00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:13.703
Good and merciful Lord, we humbly pray

161
00:12:13.786 --> 00:12:16.247
that you will safely keep all of those

162
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:19.542
who serve and protect our communities every day.

163
00:12:19.626 --> 00:12:22.462
In Jesus' name we pray.

164
00:12:22.545 --> 00:12:23.755
Amen.

165
00:12:23.838 --> 00:12:25.215
Port. Arms.

166
00:12:26.758 --> 00:12:28.176
Ready.

167
00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:29.260
Aim.

168
00:12:29.344 --> 00:12:30.595
Fire.

169
00:12:30.678 --> 00:12:31.721
Ready.

170
00:12:31.804 --> 00:12:32.722
Aim.

171
00:12:32.806 --> 00:12:33.806
Fire.

172
00:12:35.433 --> 00:12:36.476
I know...

173
00:12:38.937 --> 00:12:41.397
I know you'd forgive me.

174
00:12:41.481 --> 00:12:45.818
You were always the bigger man.

175
00:12:45.902 --> 00:12:46.986
I don't know how you did that.

176
00:12:49.572 --> 00:12:51.699
I know, I know, I should
stop crying and go home.

177
00:12:56.496 --> 00:12:58.873
Have a little sympathy, man. I gotta live with this.

178
00:13:01.251 --> 00:13:02.460
Okay.

179
00:13:06.714 --> 00:13:07.840
You're a good boy.

180
00:13:48.923 --> 00:13:50.091
Oh, hey.

181
00:13:52.719 --> 00:13:55.013
Guys don't find my night shifts convenient.

182
00:13:57.557 --> 00:13:58.558
Go ahead.

183
00:14:08.234 --> 00:14:09.444
Lucky dog.

184
00:14:09.527 --> 00:14:11.112
- Huh?
- New bed?

185
00:14:12.739 --> 00:14:14.073
Uh, right.

186
00:14:47.065 --> 00:14:49.692
Hey, uh...

187
00:14:49.776 --> 00:14:50.943
What happened?

188
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:56.240
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

189
00:14:56.324 --> 00:14:57.575
Jake, for real...

190
00:14:59.202 --> 00:15:02.080
I'm around if you want to talk.

191
00:15:02.163 --> 00:15:06.376
No pressure or anything.
I just wanted you to know that.

192
00:15:06.459 --> 00:15:07.627
Thanks.

193
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.004
I'm good.

194
00:15:12.965 --> 00:15:14.217
Okay.

195
00:15:26.104 --> 00:15:27.730
You entered the building without backup,

196
00:15:27.814 --> 00:15:30.608
pursued the suspect up several flights of stairs,

197
00:15:30.692 --> 00:15:32.318
and were ambushed.

198
00:15:32.402 --> 00:15:34.028
My partner and I entered the building.

199
00:15:34.112 --> 00:15:36.280
And we were ambushed.

200
00:15:36.364 --> 00:15:39.409
But Officer O'Keefe wasn't with you.

201
00:15:39.492 --> 00:15:43.788
O'Keefe went back to help
after the vehicle exploded.

202
00:15:45.873 --> 00:15:48.042
And you chose not to help?

203
00:15:48.126 --> 00:15:50.545
Even though there was an officer was down.

204
00:15:50.628 --> 00:15:54.674
Well, at that point, two officers were down.

205
00:15:54.757 --> 00:15:57.635
And the suspect posed
a "significant, violent threat"

206
00:15:57.719 --> 00:16:00.138
to the community.

207
00:16:00.221 --> 00:16:01.514
I read the manual.

208
00:16:03.558 --> 00:16:05.268
'Tennessee vs. Garner'.

209
00:16:05.351 --> 00:16:06.644
That's settled law.

210
00:16:06.728 --> 00:16:08.521
You carried your partner to first responders

211
00:16:08.604 --> 00:16:10.565
where you proceeded to attack one of them.

212
00:16:10.648 --> 00:16:11.816
Is that correct?

213
00:16:11.899 --> 00:16:13.401
You gonna jump in here any time?

214
00:16:13.484 --> 00:16:14.527
Union's hands are tied.

215
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.071
But don't worry, I'm taking notes.

216
00:16:17.155 --> 00:16:19.365
Great, thanks.

217
00:16:19.449 --> 00:16:20.992
We're not the enemy, Jake.

218
00:16:21.075 --> 00:16:22.368
We're just trying to paint the picture.

219
00:16:22.452 --> 00:16:24.412
I just want to know
what happened to my partner,

220
00:16:24.495 --> 00:16:25.413
and who the shooter was.

221
00:16:25.496 --> 00:16:26.539
Just take a breath.

222
00:16:26.622 --> 00:16:28.708
The suspect commanded my dog.

223
00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:30.960
In German! Like he was one of us!

224
00:16:31.043 --> 00:16:33.463
Okay, we get it.

225
00:16:33.546 --> 00:16:34.922
And let us do our jobs.

226
00:16:35.006 --> 00:16:37.341
Everything involved in this mess is S.I.U. now,

227
00:16:37.425 --> 00:16:39.552
under our review of force investigation.

228
00:16:39.635 --> 00:16:41.471
You mean, homicide investigation.

229
00:16:48.978 --> 00:16:50.605
You were in the service?

230
00:16:50.688 --> 00:16:52.815
Marines.

231
00:16:52.899 --> 00:16:54.859
Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?

232
00:17:00.698 --> 00:17:02.658
You know the answer.

233
00:17:02.742 --> 00:17:05.703
You knew that when you hired me.
It wasn't disqualifying.

234
00:17:05.787 --> 00:17:06.996
No, it wasn't.

235
00:17:08.122 --> 00:17:09.457
Did you ever get any treatment?

236
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.835
Maybe prescriptions or recreational drugs?

237
00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:13.836
Anger issues?

238
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.254
I just wanna know what happened to my partner.

239
00:17:15.338 --> 00:17:17.590
All right, gentlemen, let's call it a day.

240
00:17:26.766 --> 00:17:28.768
Very helpful, Jake.

241
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:30.186
Good luck.

242
00:17:31.395 --> 00:17:32.814
Just hang on, Jake.

243
00:17:32.897 --> 00:17:34.023
Hmm.

244
00:17:38.194 --> 00:17:40.112
Okay, Jake.

245
00:17:40.196 --> 00:17:42.782
This is how this is going to work.

246
00:17:42.865 --> 00:17:46.077
You're going to see someone. A professional.

247
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.246
They're gonna help you
work through your issues,

248
00:17:48.329 --> 00:17:50.206
and then you're going to get a new partner

249
00:17:50.289 --> 00:17:52.625
and you're gonna get back out there.

250
00:17:52.708 --> 00:17:55.086
We'll set up a therapist for you.

251
00:17:55.169 --> 00:17:58.381
You got it?

252
00:17:58.464 --> 00:18:00.758
I wanna see Ace's autopsy.

253
00:18:00.842 --> 00:18:03.177
Yeah, well,

254
00:18:03.261 --> 00:18:05.680
I just want you to shut the fuck up

255
00:18:05.763 --> 00:18:07.974
and do what you're told.

256
00:18:08.057 --> 00:18:09.559
Those are your options.

257
00:18:11.102 --> 00:18:13.563
Then fire me.

258
00:18:13.646 --> 00:18:15.064
I could care less.

259
00:18:17.275 --> 00:18:18.609
You sleep on that.

260
00:18:28.536 --> 00:18:30.538
- Clown.
- Show's a fucking circus.

261
00:18:30.621 --> 00:18:32.748
Yeah.

262
00:18:32.832 --> 00:18:35.751
Easy, Jake, you need to use the back door.

263
00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:38.170
Come on.

264
00:18:40.089 --> 00:18:42.091
How's the view from under the bus?

265
00:18:42.174 --> 00:18:44.594
I think they'd prefer I view
the front of a moving train.

266
00:18:46.554 --> 00:18:50.600
Listen, I need to find out Ace's cause of death.

267
00:18:50.683 --> 00:18:54.604
Sorry, Jake. I figured it was obvious.

268
00:18:54.687 --> 00:18:56.063
He was a good boy.

269
00:18:56.147 --> 00:18:57.607
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks.

270
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.068
Just anything peripheral.

271
00:19:02.236 --> 00:19:04.363
I need the closure.

272
00:19:04.447 --> 00:19:05.948
I'll see what I can do.

273
00:19:38.314 --> 00:19:40.107
Oop, oop, come on.

274
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:41.943
Oh, you got it. You got it.

275
00:19:43.235 --> 00:19:45.112
What a good dog you are.

276
00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:46.989
Jake?

277
00:19:47.073 --> 00:19:48.407
Come on.

278
00:19:48.491 --> 00:19:49.825
You take over here.

279
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:51.327
Hey, good dog.

280
00:19:54.872 --> 00:19:56.749
Okay, let's go.

281
00:20:46.632 --> 00:20:47.842
Getting a new dog?

282
00:20:51.429 --> 00:20:52.680
No.

283
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.600
Unsolicited advice?

284
00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.646
The longer you wait, the harder it gets.

285
00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.198
Thanks.

286
00:21:11.282 --> 00:21:12.575
Yep.

287
00:21:19.957 --> 00:21:20.875
What's up with him?

288
00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:24.253
Her. Last handler fucked her up but good.

289
00:21:24.336 --> 00:21:25.713
How so?

290
00:21:25.796 --> 00:21:26.797
Can't say.

291
00:21:27.923 --> 00:21:30.259
But not because you don't know.

292
00:21:30.342 --> 00:21:32.636
Sealed in some plea deal

293
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.181
that command wanted to keep quiet.

294
00:21:35.264 --> 00:21:36.891
They didn't give two shits about Socks though...

295
00:21:36.974 --> 00:21:39.268
so I took her back.

296
00:21:39.351 --> 00:21:41.395
She's a narcotics animal.

297
00:21:41.479 --> 00:21:43.064
You want to know what happened to her?

298
00:21:44.482 --> 00:21:45.900
Use your imagination.

299
00:21:52.239 --> 00:21:53.699
Hey, girl.

300
00:22:56.512 --> 00:22:58.264
Hey man, any of you guys know Dante?

301
00:23:00.349 --> 00:23:01.600
Dante?

302
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.037
Nice tricks, honey.

303
00:23:24.999 --> 00:23:28.544
Might as well nail a badge to your forehead.

304
00:23:28.627 --> 00:23:30.713
Like a sore thumb, huh?

305
00:23:30.796 --> 00:23:33.340
Baby, you ain’t even close to passing.

306
00:23:34.341 --> 00:23:36.177
That makes two of us.

307
00:23:45.644 --> 00:23:48.981
Know anyone down here named Dante?

308
00:23:49.064 --> 00:23:51.150
Missing a couple legs?

309
00:23:51.233 --> 00:23:54.361
A thousand dudes down here named Dante.

310
00:23:54.445 --> 00:23:56.822
All missing somethin'.

311
00:23:56.906 --> 00:23:58.908
It's like looking for a needle in a...

312
00:24:01.869 --> 00:24:04.705
actually we got a lot of those too.

313
00:24:04.788 --> 00:24:06.832
Even if I did know,

314
00:24:06.916 --> 00:24:09.168
what good would it be if I tell you?

315
00:24:16.133 --> 00:24:20.179
Face that pretty in a place like this...

316
00:24:20.262 --> 00:24:21.555
careful.

317
00:24:23.766 --> 00:24:25.434
Thanks for the smoke, honey.

318
00:24:44.912 --> 00:24:46.121
Hey!

319
00:24:46.205 --> 00:24:47.414
Looking to score, white boy?

320
00:24:48.624 --> 00:24:50.417
- Face the wall.
- I got him on this side.

321
00:24:50.501 --> 00:24:51.627
Suspicious white male.

322
00:24:52.628 --> 00:24:54.547
Satanistas was ready to smoke you, fool...

323
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:56.340
Yet, you chose to arrest me.

324
00:24:56.423 --> 00:24:58.384
They control these streets.

325
00:24:58.467 --> 00:25:00.219
The streets of downtown Los Angeles?

326
00:25:00.302 --> 00:25:01.804
Gun!

327
00:25:01.887 --> 00:25:03.806
Now, you're really fucked.

328
00:25:03.889 --> 00:25:05.182
Whoa, whoa. Hold up.

329
00:25:06.934 --> 00:25:09.937
Aren't you the dude on the news
who fucked-up that EMT?

330
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.483
Oh, shit. The one with the dead dog.

331
00:25:14.566 --> 00:25:16.694
Damn, bro. What are you doing down here?

332
00:25:16.777 --> 00:25:20.489
Errands. You know an informant down here named Dante?

333
00:25:20.572 --> 00:25:22.116
Aren't you suspended?

334
00:25:22.199 --> 00:25:24.451
You shouldn't fuck with this clique.

335
00:25:24.535 --> 00:25:26.120
Best to get lost.

336
00:25:26.203 --> 00:25:27.496
Easy enough.

337
00:26:02.448 --> 00:26:04.366
Hey! You got a dollar?

338
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:09.997
Hey, I just want some alcohol, man.

339
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.833
Well, I'll use that, but, uh, hey.

340
00:26:18.964 --> 00:26:22.217
Thank ya! Thank ya.

341
00:26:22.301 --> 00:26:24.970
Hey, you know a guy named Dante?

342
00:26:25.054 --> 00:26:26.013
Dante?

343
00:26:26.096 --> 00:26:28.140
Uh, who?

344
00:26:28.223 --> 00:26:29.350
No, but you got a dollar?

345
00:26:29.433 --> 00:26:31.268
You still got dollar you can give me?

346
00:26:31.352 --> 00:26:32.311
Get out of here.

347
00:26:33.395 --> 00:26:36.106
Yeah. I... I just need a dollar
for some alcohol, man.

348
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:37.232
You got a dollar?

349
00:26:37.316 --> 00:26:40.486
Come on. I just need a dollar, man.

350
00:26:40.569 --> 00:26:45.324
Please, man. Just a dollar. Please?

351
00:26:45.407 --> 00:26:46.700
Fuck you, man!

352
00:26:50.245 --> 00:26:53.123
Footage of LAPD officer's shooting

353
00:26:53.207 --> 00:26:54.666
caught on camera.

354
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.294
Well, as you can see here
in this cell phone video,

355
00:26:57.378 --> 00:26:59.588
after shooting and killing a suspect,

356
00:26:59.672 --> 00:27:03.092
Officer Jake Rosser violently and without warning

357
00:27:03.175 --> 00:27:05.344
assaults paramedic Gonzalo Robles,

358
00:27:05.427 --> 00:27:07.221
who was treating officers on the scene.

359
00:27:09.723 --> 00:27:10.974
Manuela

360
00:27:11.058 --> 00:27:13.977
reporting live outside City Hall where earlier today,

361
00:27:14.061 --> 00:27:16.230
LA Council members were up in arms

362
00:27:16.313 --> 00:27:17.815
about what they've seen,

363
00:27:17.898 --> 00:27:20.526
including council member, Pricilla Cross,

364
00:27:20.609 --> 00:27:22.319
who held a press conference.

365
00:27:22.403 --> 00:27:25.114
Police brutality cannot, will not--

366
00:27:25.197 --> 00:27:28.409
-Introducing the middleweight
champ of the world.

367
00:27:28.492 --> 00:27:30.494
-Ah, did you place a bet?

368
00:27:31.662 --> 00:27:32.788
-That's a low blow.

369
00:27:32.871 --> 00:27:33.831
-Yeah.

370
00:27:33.914 --> 00:27:35.249
Watched too much TV lately.

371
00:27:35.332 --> 00:27:36.291
...allocate the city’s

372
00:27:36.375 --> 00:27:38.419
law enforcement budget
to underserved neighborhoods

373
00:27:38.502 --> 00:27:41.130
and low-income housing
for our un-homed Angelinos!

374
00:27:41.213 --> 00:27:43.298
-When did the City of Angels
turn to Hell?

375
00:27:43.382 --> 00:27:45.175
-You forget
Lucifer was an angel.

376
00:27:45.259 --> 00:27:47.719
-We get what we deserve,
I guess.

377
00:27:47.803 --> 00:27:48.721
-Yeah.

378
00:27:48.804 --> 00:27:49.805
Let's see it.

379
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.100
-It's best to keep
this shit analog.

380
00:27:55.477 --> 00:27:56.603
You shouldn't have this.

381
00:28:11.702 --> 00:28:13.120
Have you ever see anything
like that before?

382
00:28:14.788 --> 00:28:16.957
-You know I like poker.
-Ramos!

383
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.418
-Yeah, I know it.

384
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:20.878
It's killed more people
in the past year

385
00:28:20.961 --> 00:28:22.129
than the Vietnam War.

386
00:28:22.212 --> 00:28:23.338
-I saw that symbol
on the street

387
00:28:23.422 --> 00:28:25.340
before Ace got shot.

388
00:28:25.424 --> 00:28:27.634
I need to know more
about the crew producing it.

389
00:28:27.718 --> 00:28:28.719
Jake...

390
00:28:31.346 --> 00:28:32.848
-What?
Go ahead, say it.

391
00:28:35.309 --> 00:28:36.477
-Thank you.

392
00:28:39.897 --> 00:28:41.732
You're playing a game
when you don't have a team.

393
00:28:41.815 --> 00:28:42.733
-Yeah, but they're using

394
00:28:42.816 --> 00:28:44.526
some BS from my past as ransom.

395
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:45.736
-So, let 'em!

396
00:28:45.819 --> 00:28:47.529
If it gets you back in the mix.

397
00:28:49.072 --> 00:28:51.909
See the shrink.

398
00:28:51.992 --> 00:28:54.495
The longer you stick with
this angry lone wolf thing,

399
00:28:54.578 --> 00:28:56.330
the more you're
gonna get iced out.

400
00:29:00.083 --> 00:29:01.418
Do yourself a favor.

401
00:29:02.836 --> 00:29:04.296
Do what lonely people do.

402
00:29:06.965 --> 00:29:08.217
Get a dog.

403
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.980
Leland!

404
00:29:22.064 --> 00:29:23.482
I'm here.

405
00:29:23.565 --> 00:29:24.858
I wanna pick a new dog.

406
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.154
Socks!

407
00:29:29.238 --> 00:29:31.740
Socks is a puzzle.

408
00:29:31.824 --> 00:29:34.076
You need a turnkey,
not a fixer-upper.

409
00:29:36.078 --> 00:29:37.579
Hey. Take it easy.

410
00:29:37.663 --> 00:29:38.914
She's been known to snap.

411
00:29:41.124 --> 00:29:42.292
I know the feeling.

412
00:29:45.504 --> 00:29:46.505
Hey, girl.

413
00:29:48.173 --> 00:29:49.341
Hey. Hey, there.

414
00:29:49.424 --> 00:29:50.425
Let's get this off you.

415
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:55.722
Yeah. Come on, girl. Come here.

416
00:29:56.974 --> 00:29:58.600
-Uh-huh.

417
00:29:58.684 --> 00:30:01.186
-Hey, now. Hey, now.

418
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.397
Hey, you.

419
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.065
Let me see that.

420
00:30:06.567 --> 00:30:08.443
-Titanium.

421
00:30:08.527 --> 00:30:10.862
Lost some teeth
doing whatever that...

422
00:30:10.946 --> 00:30:13.907
son-of-a-bitch handler
had her doing.

423
00:30:13.991 --> 00:30:16.118
He used her
like a blunt instrument.

424
00:30:16.201 --> 00:30:17.661
Not like you would, Jake.

425
00:30:20.581 --> 00:30:22.082
-Yeah, she's the one.

426
00:30:26.086 --> 00:30:27.087
-Let's go.

427
00:30:31.883 --> 00:30:32.884
-Come on.

428
00:30:35.554 --> 00:30:36.513
Come here.

429
00:30:36.597 --> 00:30:38.557
Let's get that off of you.

430
00:30:40.142 --> 00:30:41.560
Yeah.

431
00:30:46.481 --> 00:30:47.649
You hungry?

432
00:30:48.775 --> 00:30:50.652
And I'm not on the menu.

433
00:30:50.736 --> 00:30:52.696
You and me, girl.

434
00:30:52.779 --> 00:30:55.907
We're going to help
each other out.

435
00:30:55.991 --> 00:30:58.702
Nobody will take you on and everybody's got me frozen out.

436
00:31:03.707 --> 00:31:05.417
Looks like
you've seen some stuff.

437
00:31:08.211 --> 00:31:10.088
I've seen some stuff.

438
00:31:10.172 --> 00:31:11.590
There you go, bud.

439
00:31:14.593 --> 00:31:16.345
Let's go.

440
00:31:16.428 --> 00:31:17.471
Come on.

441
00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:37.991
Boy, am I hungry.

442
00:31:50.253 --> 00:31:51.630
Thoughts of suicide?

443
00:31:55.676 --> 00:31:57.928
More officers died from suicide

444
00:31:58.011 --> 00:32:01.807
than any other line-of-duty death this year.

445
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:06.478
-Line-of-duty deaths
were down, not suicides.

446
00:32:06.561 --> 00:32:07.980
-That's true.

447
00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:14.486
-Suicide is a...

448
00:32:14.569 --> 00:32:16.154
it's a universal idea.

449
00:32:18.657 --> 00:32:21.535
Suicide, that's a funny word.

450
00:32:21.618 --> 00:32:23.662
German, too, Selbstmord.

451
00:32:27.874 --> 00:32:29.710
To murder oneself.

452
00:32:36.341 --> 00:32:38.051
Have you been in therapy before?

453
00:32:42.097 --> 00:32:45.350
Would you say
you struggle with anger?

454
00:32:47.394 --> 00:32:48.937
No.

455
00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.021
Jake...

456
00:32:51.898 --> 00:32:53.692
You killed a man.

457
00:32:55.068 --> 00:32:57.612
You assaulted a paramedic.

458
00:32:59.114 --> 00:33:01.533
You're a combat veteran.

459
00:33:06.455 --> 00:33:08.498
You asked if I struggle with it...

460
00:33:10.876 --> 00:33:12.043
I don't.

461
00:33:14.588 --> 00:33:16.590
I let anger win
a long time ago.

462
00:33:23.138 --> 00:33:24.639
-Are you alone?

463
00:33:35.525 --> 00:33:36.902
-Hi.

464
00:33:36.985 --> 00:33:39.029
-You want a cup of coffee?

465
00:33:48.371 --> 00:33:50.707
-No TV?

466
00:33:50.791 --> 00:33:53.001
-I just use the neighbor's
as a radio.

467
00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.640
-Can I ask what happened?

468
00:34:06.723 --> 00:34:07.933
-You haven't heard?

469
00:34:08.016 --> 00:34:09.935
-No.

470
00:34:10.018 --> 00:34:12.145
-You must be the only one.

471
00:34:12.229 --> 00:34:13.897
The whole town hates me.

472
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.440
-Fuck the whole town.

473
00:34:25.158 --> 00:34:26.910
It's very nice.

474
00:34:26.993 --> 00:34:28.912
-You're not a very good liar.

475
00:34:28.995 --> 00:34:32.082
No. I'm not a good liar.

476
00:34:35.126 --> 00:34:38.088
That's a good thing.

477
00:34:38.171 --> 00:34:41.675
So...

478
00:34:41.758 --> 00:34:44.553
do you ever do anything for fun?

479
00:34:44.636 --> 00:34:47.806
Besides read?

480
00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:49.724
-Sometimes I watch movies.

481
00:34:52.352 --> 00:34:53.645
-Where?

482
00:34:57.232 --> 00:34:59.526
-You have a nice smile.

483
00:34:59.609 --> 00:35:01.820
Something tells me
sightings of it are rare.

484
00:35:08.994 --> 00:35:10.537
You keep it all in.

485
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:14.875
It's okay.

486
00:35:26.887 --> 00:35:29.306
She begs when I don't give her what she wants.

487
00:35:30.807 --> 00:35:32.517
-She knows you'll give in.

488
00:36:03.256 --> 00:36:04.549
Ooohh.

489
00:36:04.633 --> 00:36:06.134
All right, let's go.

490
00:36:11.431 --> 00:36:14.392
Hey.

491
00:36:14.476 --> 00:36:15.685
Fuss.

492
00:36:27.614 --> 00:36:29.741
Every morning. Every fucking morning.

493
00:36:29.824 --> 00:36:32.077
Pay me my fucking toll!

494
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.497
Pay me my fucking toll!

495
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.415
Hey! Hey!

496
00:36:37.499 --> 00:36:39.501
Hey, your dog looks burnt out.

497
00:36:46.216 --> 00:36:47.717
For some of you, it's your first day.

498
00:36:47.801 --> 00:36:50.470
For others, it's a refresher.

499
00:36:50.553 --> 00:36:52.931
Keep in mind, there's always
something new to learn.

500
00:36:56.184 --> 00:36:59.229
Handling is intuitive, right?

501
00:36:59.312 --> 00:37:00.230
It's about instinct.

502
00:37:00.313 --> 00:37:03.817
The dog's instincts,
but your instincts as well.

503
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.860
Now, these dogs, your dog--

504
00:37:05.944 --> 00:37:06.861
Platz.

505
00:37:06.945 --> 00:37:07.862
...they can run faster than you,

506
00:37:07.946 --> 00:37:13.576
hear better, smell better,
react quicker than you can.

507
00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.704
And they will read

508
00:37:15.787 --> 00:37:18.206
every little suggestion

509
00:37:18.289 --> 00:37:20.583
that you make to them.
-Hopp. Hopp. Hopp. Hopp. Hopp.

510
00:37:20.667 --> 00:37:24.504
Your dog will become
completely addicted to you.

511
00:37:24.587 --> 00:37:26.756
Don't abuse that power.

512
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.550
There's one thing
your dog can't do;

513
00:37:30.135 --> 00:37:32.929
your dog can't think ahead.

514
00:37:34.514 --> 00:37:36.433
Look, bottom line is,

515
00:37:36.516 --> 00:37:39.644
if you keep your dog safe,
your dog will keep you safe.

516
00:37:39.728 --> 00:37:41.563
So...

517
00:37:41.646 --> 00:37:43.982
let's get back to basics, uh...

518
00:37:44.065 --> 00:37:45.984
a few confidence builders, yeah?

519
00:37:48.236 --> 00:37:49.154
-Socks, Hier.

520
00:37:53.158 --> 00:37:54.159
Socks, Platz.

521
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:57.454
Platz.

522
00:37:57.537 --> 00:37:58.621
She ain't listening to him.

523
00:37:58.705 --> 00:37:59.622
Socks, Platz.

524
00:37:59.706 --> 00:38:00.915
Come on, girl.

525
00:38:00.999 --> 00:38:02.709
Come on, girl.

526
00:38:02.792 --> 00:38:03.710
Socks, Hier.

527
00:38:08.298 --> 00:38:09.299
Socks.

528
00:38:15.388 --> 00:38:17.015
She doesn't listen
to a word I say.

529
00:38:18.016 --> 00:38:19.684
Hmm. Well...

530
00:38:21.603 --> 00:38:24.064
maybe it's got nothing to do
with what you're saying.

531
00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:34.741
Socks, Hier.

532
00:38:37.285 --> 00:38:38.411
Socks, Platz.

533
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:41.122
Platz.

534
00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.833
ocks, Platz.

535
00:38:46.336 --> 00:38:47.754
Hey, Socks.

536
00:38:47.837 --> 00:38:49.756
Come here. Platz.

537
00:38:49.839 --> 00:38:50.882
Sitz. Sitz.

538
00:38:51.925 --> 00:38:55.011
Hey, Socks.
You're killing me, Socks.

539
00:38:55.095 --> 00:38:58.264
Look, what am I telling you
that I'm not saying?

540
00:38:58.348 --> 00:38:59.349
Huh?

541
00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:02.185
Yeah. Look, I know,
I seem bitter and angry,

542
00:39:02.268 --> 00:39:03.895
but I'm not mad at you.

543
00:39:03.978 --> 00:39:05.563
No, it's just--
since I've been back--

544
00:39:05.647 --> 00:39:07.398
it's a long story,
I'll tell you some other time.

545
00:39:08.817 --> 00:39:10.819
You know I can't automatically
drop all this shit

546
00:39:10.902 --> 00:39:12.028
and be as easygoing as you--
just like that.

547
00:39:12.112 --> 00:39:13.071
Hey!

548
00:39:17.242 --> 00:39:18.660
Ho-ho!

549
00:39:20.453 --> 00:39:22.205
There you go.

550
00:39:22.288 --> 00:39:24.624
Congratulations.
You flunked first grade

551
00:39:24.707 --> 00:39:26.084
but you passed
second and third.

552
00:39:28.253 --> 00:39:30.630
-Good girl. Good girl.

553
00:39:57.115 --> 00:39:59.200
My dad drank coffee
at night, too.

554
00:40:01.369 --> 00:40:05.373
He drank coffee
to go to bed, literally.

555
00:40:05.456 --> 00:40:07.208
He drank a cup of coffee
before bed

556
00:40:07.292 --> 00:40:08.835
every night to relax.

557
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.553
Do you drink anything
besides coffee?

558
00:40:18.636 --> 00:40:20.180
-I try not to.

559
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:32.692
You're seeing someone?

560
00:40:32.775 --> 00:40:34.444
Hey, beautiful.

561
00:40:34.527 --> 00:40:35.695
I am.

562
00:40:37.614 --> 00:40:39.824
Human connection is crucial.

563
00:40:46.289 --> 00:40:49.751
Any anger issues lately?

564
00:40:49.834 --> 00:40:51.211
-None whatsoever.

565
00:40:54.672 --> 00:40:56.257
And your former partner?

566
00:40:57.508 --> 00:40:59.677
How are you managing
those feelings?

567
00:41:02.096 --> 00:41:03.473
Well... I'm...

568
00:41:04.891 --> 00:41:06.059
learning to let go.

569
00:41:18.238 --> 00:41:19.781
I need keys to my vehicle.

570
00:41:26.663 --> 00:41:27.872
-You're not on the roster.

571
00:41:27.956 --> 00:41:29.874
I...

572
00:41:29.958 --> 00:41:31.501
I left his collar in the car.

573
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:34.796
Oh, fuck man.

574
00:41:34.879 --> 00:41:36.089
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

575
00:41:41.761 --> 00:41:42.679
-Thank you.

576
00:42:10.915 --> 00:42:13.251
Requesting a BOLO on a male victim.

577
00:42:13.334 --> 00:42:16.212
50s. Black. No legs.
First name Dante.

578
00:42:16.296 --> 00:42:18.506
Last seen on 6th and San Julian. Possible kidnapping.

579
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:19.590
Possible 207.

580
00:42:19.674 --> 00:42:20.883
50s. Black. No legs.

581
00:42:20.967 --> 00:42:22.719
First name Dante.
BOLO alert.

582
00:42:22.802 --> 00:42:23.845
10-4.

583
00:42:25.596 --> 00:42:27.890
1-Adam-12 responding to possible 207.

584
00:42:27.974 --> 00:42:29.058
Dante. En route.

585
00:42:29.142 --> 00:42:31.144
1-Adam-12. 10-4. Go ahead.

586
00:42:42.405 --> 00:42:43.823
Dante.

587
00:42:43.906 --> 00:42:46.492
Why am I hearing that you told people you're getting kidnapped?

588
00:42:46.576 --> 00:42:49.287
Huh? Who's fucking with you?

589
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:50.747
Is that true?

590
00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:53.291
Have you been getting kidnapped?

591
00:42:53.374 --> 00:42:54.542
Dante, I need a name.

592
00:42:54.625 --> 00:42:55.543
211 in progress,

593
00:42:55.626 --> 00:42:57.712
800 block of Maple.
Repeat, 800 block of Maple.

594
00:42:57.795 --> 00:42:59.088
Units in the area,
please respond.

595
00:42:59.172 --> 00:43:00.548
Yo, we gotta roll.

596
00:43:03.551 --> 00:43:04.552
Be safe.

597
00:43:05.678 --> 00:43:06.763
'Sup, dawg.

598
00:43:27.617 --> 00:43:28.743
Dante!

599
00:43:28.826 --> 00:43:31.329
- What's up, dawg?
- How's it going, man?

600
00:43:31.412 --> 00:43:33.373
Oh, shit.

601
00:43:33.456 --> 00:43:35.291
-Hey, man, chill out.
I'm not here to hassle you.

602
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:38.961
Don't worry about her.

603
00:43:39.045 --> 00:43:40.588
She's not coming out.

604
00:43:40.671 --> 00:43:41.631
You know about everything
that's going around

605
00:43:41.714 --> 00:43:42.715
on these streets, don't ya?

606
00:43:42.799 --> 00:43:44.258
You see everything, don't ya?

607
00:43:45.676 --> 00:43:47.011
Hey, man, listen to me.

608
00:43:47.095 --> 00:43:48.137
Listen to me.

609
00:43:48.221 --> 00:43:49.555
I need you to talk to me, okay?

610
00:43:53.559 --> 00:43:54.560
-I know her.

611
00:43:56.145 --> 00:43:57.355
-No, you don't.

612
00:43:57.438 --> 00:43:59.107
-I know her.
-No, man. That's a new dog.

613
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:00.691
But you know a lot, don't ya?

614
00:44:00.775 --> 00:44:01.859
What else can you tell me?

615
00:44:01.943 --> 00:44:03.694
I'm trying to find out
who killed the last one.

616
00:44:03.778 --> 00:44:05.863
Ask you a few questions?

617
00:44:05.947 --> 00:44:06.948
-I'm good.

618
00:44:09.325 --> 00:44:10.618
-I'll be right back, all right?

619
00:44:43.943 --> 00:44:45.069
-Mmm. Mm.

620
00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:47.530
-I just need you to answer

621
00:44:47.613 --> 00:44:49.198
a few simple questions,
all right?

622
00:45:09.218 --> 00:45:10.344
C'mon, man.
I'm not squeezing you.

623
00:45:10.428 --> 00:45:11.554
I just need a name.

624
00:45:12.972 --> 00:45:14.223
-I don’t know nothin’
about nothin’.

625
00:45:21.731 --> 00:45:23.316
-Who's calling shots
for the Satanistas?

626
00:45:27.153 --> 00:45:28.196
Hmm?

627
00:45:32.408 --> 00:45:34.827
China.

628
00:45:34.911 --> 00:45:36.996
Dirty secrets.

629
00:45:37.079 --> 00:45:38.831
Hidden in plain sight.

630
00:45:41.042 --> 00:45:43.461
Nobody gives a fuck
'cause it feels so good.

631
00:45:46.047 --> 00:45:48.049
They don't make it
to this side of town.

632
00:45:48.132 --> 00:45:50.009
-Ha. What side of town?

633
00:45:50.092 --> 00:45:51.844
-Town?
What side of the world?

634
00:45:54.972 --> 00:45:56.724
I thought she was a ghost.

635
00:45:56.807 --> 00:45:59.143
But you ain't him.

636
00:45:59.227 --> 00:46:01.604
-What are you talking about?
You know my dog?

637
00:46:01.687 --> 00:46:03.689
-I remember.

638
00:46:03.773 --> 00:46:04.690
-No, Dante.

639
00:46:04.774 --> 00:46:06.609
I just told you,
that's my new dog.

640
00:46:06.692 --> 00:46:07.860
You don't remember?

641
00:46:07.944 --> 00:46:10.196
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

642
00:46:10.279 --> 00:46:12.532
You don't remember enough.

643
00:46:12.615 --> 00:46:14.075
-I remember too much.

644
00:46:15.284 --> 00:46:17.286
-All right, Dante.

645
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.330
Stay out of the sun, okay?

646
00:46:19.413 --> 00:46:21.457
- I know.
- Leave him alone!

647
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:31.709
Preach to the choir.

648
00:46:31.709 --> 00:46:31.718
Preach to the choir. Jake, remember that's spicy!

649
00:46:31.718 --> 00:46:33.128
Jake, remember that's spicy!

650
00:46:33.376 --> 00:46:34.626
I remember, Gustavo...

651
00:46:35.001 --> 00:46:36.712
I know. Jake. I know.

652
00:46:44.146 --> 00:46:45.314
Hey.

653
00:46:49.735 --> 00:46:53.447
Jesus!

654
00:46:53.531 --> 00:46:55.324
I see you made a new friend.

655
00:46:55.408 --> 00:46:57.785
-Yeah. Good advice
is good advice.

656
00:46:57.868 --> 00:47:00.496
Regardless of who gives it.

657
00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.415
Why do they call it China?

658
00:47:02.498 --> 00:47:03.916
-'Cause that's where it's from.

659
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.042
Along with everything else,

660
00:47:05.126 --> 00:47:07.128
now you have synthetic
opioids too.

661
00:47:07.211 --> 00:47:08.504
-Right.

662
00:47:10.464 --> 00:47:12.008
-Jake...

663
00:47:12.091 --> 00:47:14.427
what do you want?

664
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:16.554
-Vehicle registration.

665
00:47:16.637 --> 00:47:18.222
The car that blew up.

666
00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:28.816
-I haven't forgotten
what you did for me.

667
00:47:28.899 --> 00:47:31.068
And you've kept it on the DL
like you promised.

668
00:47:31.152 --> 00:47:32.236
-Ramos. Drop it.

669
00:47:33.446 --> 00:47:35.156
-Don't make me feel guilty.

670
00:47:35.239 --> 00:47:36.490
-You're doing that
all by yourself.

671
00:47:36.574 --> 00:47:38.409
-Yeah, knowing that I'm
the root of my own problems

672
00:47:38.492 --> 00:47:39.827
doesn't help.

673
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:41.787
-You gambled a little.

674
00:47:41.871 --> 00:47:42.997
It's no big deal.

675
00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.957
It was only a three-hour drive
to pick you up.

676
00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:47.001
-Yeah, while my daughter
was at home alone.

677
00:47:47.084 --> 00:47:48.002
-Okay, you win.

678
00:47:48.085 --> 00:47:49.629
You owe me.

679
00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:54.425
-How do you feel?

680
00:47:54.508 --> 00:47:56.510
-Better.

681
00:47:56.594 --> 00:47:58.512
-You're not just saying that,
are you?

682
00:47:58.596 --> 00:47:59.847
-No, why would I do that?

683
00:48:02.391 --> 00:48:03.476
-No.

684
00:48:03.559 --> 00:48:06.145
-So I will sign off here

685
00:48:06.228 --> 00:48:08.522
and say you're good to go.

686
00:48:08.606 --> 00:48:10.191
Healthy as a horse.

687
00:48:15.863 --> 00:48:17.448
I'd like to believe that...

688
00:48:19.784 --> 00:48:22.620
that you've actually thought

689
00:48:22.703 --> 00:48:25.081
about the things that
you've been through, Jake.

690
00:48:38.386 --> 00:48:40.137
-You like art?

691
00:48:40.221 --> 00:48:42.473
-Sure. Do you?

692
00:48:42.556 --> 00:48:45.017
-I do. I do.

693
00:48:46.852 --> 00:48:48.187
I think it's...

694
00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.441
what we do to remind ourselves

695
00:48:52.525 --> 00:48:58.572
that we can, you know, escape the swamp of being an animal.

696
00:49:00.866 --> 00:49:02.993
There's a lot of truth in that.

697
00:49:03.077 --> 00:49:06.455
-I've seen how creative
people can be in the art of...

698
00:49:07.665 --> 00:49:09.333
combat, killing.

699
00:49:13.879 --> 00:49:16.048
And things outright ingenious.

700
00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:19.635
And the destruction
of innocence.

701
00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.893
Used to signal to people
with any shred of virtue...

702
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:35.109
that you won't win
by being the bigger person.

703
00:49:39.029 --> 00:49:40.865
-That causes you
to reject people.

704
00:49:42.867 --> 00:49:45.202
Because you know...

705
00:49:45.286 --> 00:49:46.620
more than most...

706
00:49:48.038 --> 00:49:51.125
we can never escape
being animals.

707
00:49:59.216 --> 00:50:00.551
More or less.

708
00:50:21.697 --> 00:50:23.324
Xiang... Xi.

709
00:50:23.407 --> 00:50:26.535
Xiang... Xi. 2806 Pinecrest.

710
00:50:26.619 --> 00:50:28.454
Just another stolen car, Jake.

711
00:50:28.537 --> 00:50:30.414
That's it. We're square.

712
00:50:44.136 --> 00:50:46.347
You ready to get back out there?

713
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:47.431
Hmm?

714
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.101
Hey.

715
00:50:52.102 --> 00:50:53.604
Don't let me blow it today, okay?

716
00:50:58.025 --> 00:50:59.610
Well, let's see how long it takes

717
00:50:59.693 --> 00:51:00.694
before she quits.

718
00:51:03.364 --> 00:51:04.657
You show 'em, girl.

719
00:51:05.658 --> 00:51:06.742
Such.

720
00:51:24.134 --> 00:51:25.261
Hey. Hey!

721
00:51:32.726 --> 00:51:34.478
That dog moved the whole damn tire!

722
00:51:38.566 --> 00:51:39.692
Come here.

723
00:51:39.775 --> 00:51:41.777
Atta girl. Atta girl.

724
00:51:54.707 --> 00:51:55.708
Come on!

725
00:51:57.418 --> 00:51:58.419
Socks! Ablegen.

726
00:51:59.461 --> 00:52:00.379
Come here.

727
00:52:00.462 --> 00:52:02.923
Ohhh!

728
00:52:03.007 --> 00:52:05.009
Oh, yeah, good girl.

729
00:52:05.092 --> 00:52:06.969
Good girl. Atta girl.

730
00:52:07.052 --> 00:52:08.387
I'd say!

731
00:52:15.477 --> 00:52:17.062
Whew.

732
00:52:17.146 --> 00:52:19.648
I knew I smelled something.

733
00:52:19.732 --> 00:52:22.067
They got you walking
a new dog, Rosser?

734
00:52:22.151 --> 00:52:24.612
Hernandez, how the hell were you ever a sniper

735
00:52:24.695 --> 00:52:26.488
if you can't shut the fuck up?

736
00:52:26.572 --> 00:52:28.991
Hey, I'm just making conversation.

737
00:52:29.074 --> 00:52:30.200
Which reminds me.

738
00:52:31.243 --> 00:52:32.786
You didn't happen to, uh,

739
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:35.789
roll up on my man, Dante,
did you?

740
00:52:35.873 --> 00:52:37.291
I know it was you.

741
00:52:37.374 --> 00:52:39.209
You shake down
an informant of mine again

742
00:52:39.293 --> 00:52:41.211
without talking to me first,

743
00:52:41.295 --> 00:52:43.964
I swear to God,
I will fuck you up!

744
00:52:47.259 --> 00:52:48.928
Get that bitch under control.

745
00:52:50.679 --> 00:52:52.306
Socks. Platz.

746
00:52:56.393 --> 00:52:58.687
You know something, Rosser?

747
00:52:58.771 --> 00:53:00.356
I'm starting to like her.

748
00:53:00.439 --> 00:53:02.483
She got bigger balls than you.

749
00:53:10.282 --> 00:53:11.867
- Welcome back, Jake.
- Thanks, Parnell.

750
00:53:14.787 --> 00:53:16.038
Hey, sarge.

751
00:53:17.081 --> 00:53:19.291
How about you put me on 8?

752
00:53:19.375 --> 00:53:20.876
The Spa? You Rosser?

753
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.919
Yeah, I think it would be good for us

754
00:53:22.002 --> 00:53:23.545
to work our way back in, you know?

755
00:53:23.629 --> 00:53:25.547
Like a warm-up.

756
00:53:25.631 --> 00:53:27.132
Okay.

757
00:53:27.216 --> 00:53:29.927
Not a lot of guys would show that type of humility.

758
00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:31.011
Thanks.

759
00:53:32.012 --> 00:53:33.097
It wasn't a compliment.

760
00:53:50.364 --> 00:53:51.407
Come on.

761
00:53:52.783 --> 00:53:54.326
Let's go. You gotta sit up here with me.

762
00:53:58.247 --> 00:53:59.248
Seriously?

763
00:53:59.331 --> 00:54:00.332
Hey, fetch!

764
00:54:01.834 --> 00:54:03.544
See you later, puto bitch!

765
00:54:16.223 --> 00:54:17.141
That's ridiculous.

766
00:54:17.224 --> 00:54:18.142
Did you tell Larry
to lock the door? Yeah.

767
00:54:18.225 --> 00:54:19.351
-See that, Socks?

768
00:54:19.435 --> 00:54:20.811
They talk to themselves
over here too.

769
00:54:25.941 --> 00:54:26.984
I knew a--

770
00:55:02.311 --> 00:55:03.479
ABD Security.

771
00:55:03.562 --> 00:55:04.480
Hey, how are you doing?

772
00:55:04.563 --> 00:55:06.565
Uh, this is Officer Rosser, LAPD.

773
00:55:06.648 --> 00:55:07.858
How can I help you?

774
00:55:07.941 --> 00:55:10.152
Driving by and saw a possible sign of forced entry

775
00:55:10.235 --> 00:55:11.487
at one of your locations.

776
00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:12.821
Which location?

777
00:55:12.905 --> 00:55:14.740
2806 Pinecrest.

778
00:55:14.823 --> 00:55:16.241
Do you have an emergency report?

779
00:55:16.325 --> 00:55:17.701
Your system active?

780
00:55:17.785 --> 00:55:19.203
System looks good.

781
00:55:19.286 --> 00:55:20.871
Yeah, yeah. You should test it.

782
00:55:20.954 --> 00:55:21.955
No problem.

783
00:55:30.964 --> 00:55:32.925
Possible burglary, 2806 Pinecrest.

784
00:55:34.676 --> 00:55:36.512
This is King 8. I'm in the vicinity.

785
00:55:36.595 --> 00:55:37.888
Show me en route.

786
00:55:37.971 --> 00:55:39.389
10-4.

787
00:56:32.609 --> 00:56:33.694
King 8. Sounds inside the residence.

788
00:56:33.777 --> 00:56:34.987
Going to investigate.

789
00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:35.988
10-4. Requesting back-up?

790
00:56:36.071 --> 00:56:37.072
Negative.

791
00:57:27.414 --> 00:57:28.665
Platz.

792
00:57:46.099 --> 00:57:47.142
Socks, here.

793
00:57:47.226 --> 00:57:48.227
Socks!

794
00:57:54.358 --> 00:57:55.400
Socks!

795
00:58:07.663 --> 00:58:08.747
Socks...

796
00:58:28.267 --> 00:58:30.435
Hey. Boy, where'd you come from?

797
00:58:30.519 --> 00:58:31.436
Faas!

798
00:59:28.452 --> 00:59:29.911
-How did you manage this?

799
00:59:31.079 --> 00:59:32.581
You don't have a scratch on you.

800
00:59:34.124 --> 00:59:35.167
- Ugh! Thanks.
- Breaking news.

801
00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:36.251
Another deadly incident

802
00:59:36.335 --> 00:59:38.670
involving an LAPD officer
in Bel Air

803
00:59:38.754 --> 00:59:41.631
has local residents reeling
and LAPD bracing

804
00:59:41.715 --> 00:59:44.509
for social pushback,
turmoil, unrest--

805
00:59:49.306 --> 00:59:50.432
-Hey, cut it out.

806
00:59:56.146 --> 00:59:57.856
What? You have to pee again?

807
01:00:00.317 --> 01:00:02.736
What?

808
01:00:02.819 --> 01:00:04.738
Food?

809
01:00:13.538 --> 01:00:15.791
This? This is what
you're looking at?

810
01:00:15.874 --> 01:00:17.292
Hey, girl. Oh, oh.

811
01:00:17.376 --> 01:00:18.627
Come here.

812
01:00:21.254 --> 01:00:22.547
There’s something
you're not telling me.

813
01:00:51.618 --> 01:00:53.286
Made in China.

814
01:01:26.653 --> 01:01:28.405
Do you think you have a thing for heat?

815
01:01:28.488 --> 01:01:30.282
Or are you just really fuckin' lucky?

816
01:01:30.365 --> 01:01:32.701
-Sir, I was in Bel Air.

817
01:01:32.784 --> 01:01:35.245
The Spa.
How could I have known?

818
01:01:35.328 --> 01:01:36.872
-You know,
that's a really good question.

819
01:01:36.955 --> 01:01:39.708
Ramos, how could Rosser here
have known?

820
01:01:41.293 --> 01:01:42.252
-I'm sorry?

821
01:01:42.335 --> 01:01:45.005
Are you?

822
01:01:45.088 --> 01:01:47.966
I've only got one other report here

823
01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:51.303
with that address in Bel Air.

824
01:01:51.386 --> 01:01:53.305
And you know
whose name is on it.

825
01:01:55.015 --> 01:01:56.850
We cased the house a few years ago

826
01:01:56.933 --> 01:01:58.768
but nothing materialized.

827
01:01:58.852 --> 01:02:00.645
Sure as fuck has materialized now,

828
01:02:00.729 --> 01:02:01.771
hasn't it?

829
01:02:01.855 --> 01:02:04.149
Do you have any idea how much
fucking grief I'm getting

830
01:02:04.232 --> 01:02:05.817
because we busted a meth lab

831
01:02:05.901 --> 01:02:08.570
in the middle of Bel fucking Air?

832
01:02:08.653 --> 01:02:10.614
You know who lives
in that neighborhood?

833
01:02:10.697 --> 01:02:13.241
-Not meth, sir. Fentanyl.

834
01:02:13.325 --> 01:02:14.576
They sweat it down
for street product and--

835
01:02:14.659 --> 01:02:15.994
Oh, shut the fuck up, Ramos.

836
01:02:16.077 --> 01:02:19.414
I called you in here
so that you could thank Rosser

837
01:02:19.498 --> 01:02:22.751
for finishing the job
that you couldn't do.

838
01:02:22.834 --> 01:02:23.960
So, go ahead.

839
01:02:24.044 --> 01:02:24.961
Tell him how you sent in

840
01:02:25.045 --> 01:02:26.796
the human torpedo here.

841
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.715
The guy with all the issues

842
01:02:28.798 --> 01:02:30.509
to do the job you couldn't.

843
01:02:30.592 --> 01:02:32.302
-Jake, look, I...

844
01:02:32.385 --> 01:02:34.804
I don't know if you assholes have heard this

845
01:02:34.888 --> 01:02:36.556
but the mob has its boot

846
01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.183
on the throat of City Hall.

847
01:02:38.266 --> 01:02:40.143
We are getting gutted,

848
01:02:40.227 --> 01:02:43.355
and I'm looking at two
prime reasons why right here.

849
01:02:45.232 --> 01:02:46.983
Now, get the fuck out!

850
01:02:50.737 --> 01:02:52.614
You do the job
I tell you to do, Ramos.

851
01:02:52.697 --> 01:02:54.366
You don't get to
just make up the rules

852
01:02:54.449 --> 01:02:55.367
as you go along.

853
01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:56.368
Come on.

854
01:02:56.451 --> 01:02:58.995
And you... you get to go back to therapy.

855
01:02:59.079 --> 01:03:01.456
What? You shot one guy
and you stabbed another.

856
01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:03.458
What the hell are you
gonna think of next?

857
01:03:04.751 --> 01:03:06.836
Oh, I'm sure I'll think of something.

858
01:03:14.594 --> 01:03:15.595
Jake.

859
01:03:16.888 --> 01:03:17.806
Listen...

860
01:03:17.889 --> 01:03:19.391
Ramos. Take it easy.

861
01:03:19.474 --> 01:03:20.892
What? You got a nice seizure,

862
01:03:20.976 --> 01:03:22.394
and I got one of the guys
that killed my dog.

863
01:03:24.854 --> 01:03:26.022
Sitz.

864
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:30.026
He spoke German.
Like the other guy.

865
01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:32.028
I need to know
what that's about...

866
01:03:32.112 --> 01:03:33.280
-I don't know...

867
01:03:33.363 --> 01:03:35.198
-Find out who
handled Socks before me.

868
01:03:35.282 --> 01:03:36.783
It's at S.I.U.,

869
01:03:36.866 --> 01:03:38.827
could be a grand jury
indictment, sealed.

870
01:03:40.203 --> 01:03:41.121
-It's not gonna happen.

871
01:03:41.204 --> 01:03:42.122
-Come on, Ramos.

872
01:03:42.205 --> 01:03:43.999
you're a good detective,
I know you can figure it out.

873
01:03:54.843 --> 01:03:56.511
Hey, Jake.

874
01:03:56.595 --> 01:03:57.512
Where are you going?

875
01:03:57.596 --> 01:03:59.097
-Going for a walk.

876
01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.682
-Do you wanna watch a movie
when you get back?

877
01:04:00.765 --> 01:04:01.891
-I can't tonight, babe.

878
01:04:01.975 --> 01:04:04.894
I'm gotta go
take care of something.

879
01:04:04.978 --> 01:04:08.481
-Alright. Be safe.

880
01:04:12.527 --> 01:04:13.528
-Come on.

881
01:04:38.428 --> 01:04:40.305
What's going on, Socks?

882
01:04:41.765 --> 01:04:43.391
Huh?

883
01:04:46.895 --> 01:04:48.605
I told you not to come.

884
01:05:03.578 --> 01:05:04.913
Hey, hey. No!

885
01:05:04.996 --> 01:05:07.666
Hey. You no get us killed.

886
01:05:11.002 --> 01:05:13.713
You're a complicated dog.
You know that?

887
01:05:13.797 --> 01:05:15.298
You think too much
for your own good.

888
01:05:16.758 --> 01:05:19.052
Come on. Let's go.

889
01:05:20.762 --> 01:05:21.721
Let's go.

890
01:07:26.304 --> 01:07:27.972
-Turn around.

891
01:07:28.056 --> 01:07:29.224
Slowly.

892
01:07:31.726 --> 01:07:33.436
Hey! Turn around!

893
01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.562
Stay where you are.

894
01:07:43.279 --> 01:07:44.364
Who do you work for?

895
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:48.576
- Nobody.
- Take off your mask.

896
01:08:00.171 --> 01:08:01.422
-I thought Socks was dead.

897
01:08:02.674 --> 01:08:04.843
- What did you say?
- Where's Santiago?

898
01:08:04.926 --> 01:08:06.302
Who's Santiago?

899
01:08:06.386 --> 01:08:07.929
- Who... who are you?
- Who's Santiago?!

900
01:08:08.012 --> 01:08:10.431
All right. Come on. Careful.

901
01:08:10.515 --> 01:08:13.476
One drop of this
and you're a goner.

902
01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.311
Who's Santiago?!

903
01:08:22.861 --> 01:08:24.445
Socks, Ablegen.

904
01:08:32.453 --> 01:08:34.831
Socks. Faas!

905
01:08:34.914 --> 01:08:35.915
Nein.

906
01:08:38.251 --> 01:08:39.544
Faas!

907
01:08:41.004 --> 01:08:41.921
Töten.

908
01:08:51.431 --> 01:08:52.432
You brought her back to me.

909
01:08:55.643 --> 01:08:58.062
Socks. Hier

910
01:08:58.146 --> 01:08:59.188
Nein.

911
01:09:14.037 --> 01:09:15.705
It's time to choose...

912
01:09:17.665 --> 01:09:19.584
There is our side.

913
01:09:19.667 --> 01:09:20.793
Or suicide.

914
01:09:21.836 --> 01:09:23.588
You'll bring me more dogs.

915
01:09:25.089 --> 01:09:26.758
I'm not dirty.

916
01:09:30.929 --> 01:09:34.515
I know you...

917
01:09:34.599 --> 01:09:36.142
I know your animal.

918
01:10:45.253 --> 01:10:47.964
911. What's your emergency?

919
01:10:53.761 --> 01:10:54.804
-You using again?

920
01:10:58.141 --> 01:11:00.018
The stress of this job
can be a lot.

921
01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:04.188
-What is this?

922
01:11:04.272 --> 01:11:08.735
This is the third incident in a month.

923
01:11:09.819 --> 01:11:11.863
They took my dog.

924
01:11:11.946 --> 01:11:12.947
Who?

925
01:11:14.574 --> 01:11:15.867
The Satanistas.

926
01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:19.746
They got a paint factory in Vernon,

927
01:11:19.829 --> 01:11:21.289
where they cut fentanyl,

928
01:11:21.372 --> 01:11:23.958
like the place in Bel Air.

929
01:11:24.042 --> 01:11:25.668
They killed Ace and took Socks.

930
01:11:27.712 --> 01:11:29.797
Xiang Xi. EXIS Therapeutics.

931
01:11:29.881 --> 01:11:31.257
Look it up.

932
01:11:32.258 --> 01:11:34.010
Yeah, we'll get right on that, Jake.

933
01:11:36.054 --> 01:11:37.346
But what we need to decide right now

934
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:38.931
is whether your
substance abuse problem

935
01:11:39.015 --> 01:11:41.601
is something we need
to be concerned about.

936
01:11:41.684 --> 01:11:43.728
I don't know. Maybe it's been brought on by your PTSD?

937
01:11:43.811 --> 01:11:44.979
-I was drugged.

938
01:11:45.063 --> 01:11:46.105
Well, it wouldn't be the first time,

939
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:47.690
according to your file.

940
01:11:48.816 --> 01:11:50.902
Jake, what he's trying to say...

941
01:11:50.985 --> 01:11:51.903
What I'm trying to say is,

942
01:11:51.986 --> 01:11:54.155
we think it's time for you to take a break.

943
01:11:56.157 --> 01:11:57.492
A long one.

944
01:12:16.219 --> 01:12:17.595
Hey, Rosser.

945
01:12:17.678 --> 01:12:18.679
Hop in, man.

946
01:12:19.847 --> 01:12:20.890
-I'm good.

947
01:12:20.973 --> 01:12:22.266
No, seriously, Jake.

948
01:12:24.227 --> 01:12:25.353
Get in.

949
01:12:36.405 --> 01:12:37.406
They're sweeping the underpass

950
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:38.699
for Socks's body.

951
01:12:41.452 --> 01:12:42.453
A waste of time.

952
01:12:43.538 --> 01:12:44.664
I know.

953
01:12:46.082 --> 01:12:48.543
I don't believe that S.I.U. bullshit.

954
01:12:50.044 --> 01:12:52.880
I know they got your partner.

955
01:12:53.923 --> 01:12:55.049
-Who told you that?

956
01:12:57.426 --> 01:12:58.427
Ramos?

957
01:13:03.224 --> 01:13:05.434
Why the fuck do you care?

958
01:13:05.518 --> 01:13:06.853
They fuck with your partner,

959
01:13:06.936 --> 01:13:09.480
and they fuck with you...

960
01:13:09.564 --> 01:13:11.023
they fuck with me.

961
01:13:14.861 --> 01:13:16.904
Find Socks, brother.

962
01:13:18.447 --> 01:13:21.659
And when you do,
we're gonna hit them so hard

963
01:13:21.742 --> 01:13:24.620
they'll be shitting blood
and fucking teeth.

964
01:13:44.432 --> 01:13:45.641
What are you doing?

965
01:13:45.725 --> 01:13:46.767
I'm going away for a while.

966
01:13:46.851 --> 01:13:48.144
What are you talking about?

967
01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:54.192
You know, you do this stoic,

968
01:13:54.275 --> 01:13:55.860
"I can handle my shit' thing,"

969
01:13:55.943 --> 01:13:57.528
but open your eyes.

970
01:13:57.612 --> 01:13:59.155
You keep so much bottled up,

971
01:13:59.238 --> 01:14:00.489
you're blowing up
everything around you.

972
01:14:00.573 --> 01:14:02.408
-You're probably right. Yeah.
-Yeah, that. That's exactly

973
01:14:02.491 --> 01:14:04.243
what I'm talking about.
-I'm agreeing with you.

974
01:14:04.327 --> 01:14:05.620
-So you don't have to
argue with me.

975
01:14:05.703 --> 01:14:06.746
That is not the same thing.

976
01:14:06.829 --> 01:14:08.623
-Mia, this is the last thing
that I need right now.

977
01:14:08.706 --> 01:14:09.665
-But it was the first thing

978
01:14:09.749 --> 01:14:12.043
when you wanted to
get back on the job.

979
01:14:12.126 --> 01:14:15.087
Your friends from
the Special Investigations Unit,

980
01:14:15.171 --> 01:14:17.840
Officer Reed and Hasting
came by the hospital.

981
01:14:17.924 --> 01:14:20.468
They mentioned you needed
to look normal, stable,

982
01:14:20.551 --> 01:14:22.220
so your shrink would sign
your permission slip.

983
01:14:22.303 --> 01:14:25.431
-That had nothing
to do with this.

984
01:14:25.514 --> 01:14:27.516
-The fucked-up thing...

985
01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.727
I actually would have been
okay with that.

986
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:31.604
If it wasn't
for everything else.

987
01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:36.943
Look, I don't know
what happened to Socks,

988
01:14:37.026 --> 01:14:38.027
but...

989
01:14:39.779 --> 01:14:41.113
I hope she's okay.

990
01:14:52.208 --> 01:14:54.126
-Thoughts of suicide, Jake?

991
01:15:04.637 --> 01:15:05.680
-No.

992
01:15:38.337 --> 01:15:39.422
-Hey.

993
01:15:39.505 --> 01:15:42.049
I told you stay off
my fucking bridge.

994
01:15:42.133 --> 01:15:45.803
This is my bridge! It's mine!

995
01:15:45.886 --> 01:15:48.556
Get off my fucking bridge!

996
01:15:48.639 --> 01:15:50.099
Pay me my fucking toll.

997
01:15:51.726 --> 01:15:53.811
Pay me my fucking toll!

998
01:16:03.779 --> 01:16:05.740
Shit!

999
01:16:05.823 --> 01:16:07.742
Shit! Nice!

1000
01:16:07.825 --> 01:16:09.368
Nice!

1001
01:16:09.452 --> 01:16:10.661
Hey!

1002
01:16:10.745 --> 01:16:11.871
Where's your dog?

1003
01:16:14.165 --> 01:16:16.292
Hey, where's your fucking dog?

1004
01:16:48.949 --> 01:16:50.618
-Just ran out of road.

1005
01:16:53.412 --> 01:16:54.497
-Listen, Jake.

1006
01:16:55.623 --> 01:16:57.958
I know a guy if you're
looking for work.

1007
01:16:59.502 --> 01:17:02.380
Luis' Lumber in Tehachapi.

1008
01:17:04.673 --> 01:17:05.925
Look him up.

1009
01:17:06.926 --> 01:17:08.302
Luis in Tehachapi.

1010
01:17:09.637 --> 01:17:12.598
If you're looking. For work.

1011
01:17:18.854 --> 01:17:20.564
There's always more road.

1012
01:18:16.745 --> 01:18:18.247
...weather together on the fives

1013
01:18:18.330 --> 01:18:20.040
as we head into the holiday weekend.

1014
01:18:20.124 --> 01:18:22.084
It's gonna be a spicy
Fourth of July.

1015
01:18:22.168 --> 01:18:24.253
High temperatures into
the upper 90s in the Valley,

1016
01:18:24.336 --> 01:18:25.713
80s at the beaches.

1017
01:18:25.796 --> 01:18:28.758
Let's go live
to Bella Ericson in our--

1018
01:19:08.214 --> 01:19:09.423
Santiago.

1019
01:19:12.468 --> 01:19:14.386
What did you just call me?

1020
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:15.930
You heard me.

1021
01:19:16.013 --> 01:19:17.681
You got the wrong guy.

1022
01:19:19.934 --> 01:19:21.268
It's about Socks.

1023
01:19:23.062 --> 01:19:24.313
I don't wear any.

1024
01:19:26.065 --> 01:19:27.942
So, get off my fucking property.

1025
01:19:29.443 --> 01:19:31.654
If you're still here
by the time I get back,

1026
01:19:31.737 --> 01:19:33.072
I'm gonna cut you
in fuckin' half.

1027
01:19:33.155 --> 01:19:34.615
-You're not gonna do that.

1028
01:19:35.658 --> 01:19:38.244
You won't because
you don't want them finding you.

1029
01:19:38.327 --> 01:19:40.162
-Who?

1030
01:19:40.246 --> 01:19:41.997
-The people who took our dog.

1031
01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:47.920
Let's get a cup of coffee.

1032
01:19:48.003 --> 01:19:49.296
-I don't drink any.

1033
01:19:51.549 --> 01:19:52.758
I gotta work.

1034
01:19:55.052 --> 01:19:56.178
You wanna talk to me?

1035
01:19:58.472 --> 01:19:59.723
Tag along.

1036
01:20:06.522 --> 01:20:08.274
My indictment
is still under seal.

1037
01:20:10.234 --> 01:20:11.151
-Yeah.

1038
01:20:11.235 --> 01:20:12.403
-How did you find me?

1039
01:20:15.781 --> 01:20:17.157
-You know I can't say.

1040
01:20:30.546 --> 01:20:32.464
-You can take your hand
off your gun now.

1041
01:20:40.806 --> 01:20:43.642
I got a contract
with Forest Services.

1042
01:20:43.726 --> 01:20:44.893
To clear out this shit.

1043
01:20:50.232 --> 01:20:51.358
When you see it...

1044
01:20:52.651 --> 01:20:53.902
it looks healthy...

1045
01:20:59.950 --> 01:21:01.243
but inside...

1046
01:21:02.244 --> 01:21:04.913
it's diseased.

1047
01:21:04.997 --> 01:21:05.998
Broken.

1048
01:21:07.041 --> 01:21:11.837
I give it a new life like a--
a nice piece of gluelam.

1049
01:21:13.172 --> 01:21:15.299
Did you know that that shit
is stronger than steel?

1050
01:21:15.382 --> 01:21:16.550
-Santiago,

1051
01:21:16.634 --> 01:21:17.927
I don't have a lot of time.

1052
01:21:20.929 --> 01:21:23.182
I gotta know what you and Socks
were mixed up in,

1053
01:21:23.265 --> 01:21:24.850
where I can find her.

1054
01:21:27.269 --> 01:21:29.355
-She's a great fuckin' dog.

1055
01:21:30.522 --> 01:21:31.523
The best.

1056
01:21:35.861 --> 01:21:37.988
I had a family once.

1057
01:21:38.072 --> 01:21:39.239
She was part of it.

1058
01:21:43.619 --> 01:21:44.995
Look what I did.

1059
01:21:49.541 --> 01:21:52.169
You tell yourself
that they're family but...

1060
01:21:53.253 --> 01:21:55.005
they're just tools.

1061
01:21:55.089 --> 01:21:57.091
Gotta realize that.

1062
01:22:01.053 --> 01:22:02.429
-What are you talking about?

1063
01:22:11.397 --> 01:22:12.940
-She got sick.

1064
01:22:17.736 --> 01:22:19.154
My daughter.

1065
01:22:21.115 --> 01:22:22.700
I couldn't keep up.

1066
01:22:24.618 --> 01:22:26.578
The co-pays
and all that shit.

1067
01:22:27.579 --> 01:22:28.789
They were charging me
thousands of dollars

1068
01:22:28.872 --> 01:22:30.666
for the same painkillers
I was confiscating

1069
01:22:30.749 --> 01:22:32.835
from those dudes downtown,

1070
01:22:32.918 --> 01:22:35.963
you know, the ones
that shit their pants.

1071
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:40.884
I had to learn
how to make lemonade.

1072
01:22:44.012 --> 01:22:45.514
Make ends meet.

1073
01:22:53.105 --> 01:22:54.690
-You got them their dogs.

1074
01:22:57.401 --> 01:22:58.819
-Yeah.

1075
01:23:00.863 --> 01:23:03.282
Told them how to--
how to use them.

1076
01:23:03.365 --> 01:23:06.034
They'd fuck them up.

1077
01:23:06.118 --> 01:23:11.373
They had them chasing highs
instead of tennis balls.

1078
01:23:11.457 --> 01:23:13.375
But when I saw
what they did to Socks...

1079
01:23:14.835 --> 01:23:16.879
she was half dead.

1080
01:23:16.962 --> 01:23:18.130
So, I told 'em
that she had worms...

1081
01:23:18.213 --> 01:23:19.548
and that worms spread...

1082
01:23:19.631 --> 01:23:22.009
that they will crawl
into your skin

1083
01:23:22.092 --> 01:23:23.552
and make their way
up to your eyes,

1084
01:23:23.635 --> 01:23:24.553
and get into your brain.

1085
01:23:24.636 --> 01:23:26.805
Which is true.
But when they heard that shit...

1086
01:23:29.141 --> 01:23:31.435
they wanted nothing
to do with her.

1087
01:23:33.604 --> 01:23:35.230
So, I got her back.

1088
01:23:38.066 --> 01:23:39.568
I got her clean.

1089
01:23:44.782 --> 01:23:45.783
Where are they?

1090
01:23:48.744 --> 01:23:50.162
Xiang Xi house?

1091
01:23:50.245 --> 01:23:51.580
Xiang...

1092
01:23:52.956 --> 01:23:55.000
Xiang Xi.

1093
01:23:55.083 --> 01:23:57.044
There’s a new opium war.

1094
01:23:57.127 --> 01:23:58.754
The Chinese smuggle
that shit to Mexico,

1095
01:23:58.837 --> 01:23:59.755
and the cartels flood

1096
01:23:59.838 --> 01:24:01.799
that shit up
though the border.

1097
01:24:01.882 --> 01:24:02.800
They drop it right...

1098
01:24:02.883 --> 01:24:04.927
in the actual dog shit,

1099
01:24:05.010 --> 01:24:05.928
right in the city.

1100
01:24:06.011 --> 01:24:07.096
Nobody's gonna look at that.

1101
01:24:07.179 --> 01:24:10.140
Nobody's gonna... gives a shit about that.

1102
01:24:10.224 --> 01:24:12.476
-And the Satanistas sweat it
into street product.

1103
01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:20.025
-Anything anybody
shoots, smokes, snorts--

1104
01:24:20.108 --> 01:24:22.236
the Chinese scratches...

1105
01:24:23.237 --> 01:24:24.822
The most addictive thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1106
01:24:24.905 --> 01:24:26.406
I've never seen
anything like that.

1107
01:24:27.491 --> 01:24:28.992
And we're to blame for that

1108
01:24:29.076 --> 01:24:30.702
'cause there's one thing
that we're more addicted

1109
01:24:30.786 --> 01:24:33.747
than anything else,
is addiction itself.

1110
01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:37.876
-Santiago...

1111
01:24:40.212 --> 01:24:41.547
where's Socks?

1112
01:24:45.634 --> 01:24:48.387
-Shit rolls down hill, Jake.

1113
01:24:50.889 --> 01:24:52.141
Follow it.

1114
01:24:54.726 --> 01:24:56.228
-What about your daughter?

1115
01:25:05.946 --> 01:25:07.281
-When I realized
I didn't have the balls

1116
01:25:07.364 --> 01:25:08.740
to shoot myself,

1117
01:25:12.494 --> 01:25:15.122
I gave Socks a button.

1118
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:19.710
The one thing
you never teach a K-9.

1119
01:27:07.067 --> 01:27:08.819
I found her.

1120
01:27:08.902 --> 01:27:10.404
I'll text you the address.

1121
01:28:55.042 --> 01:28:55.751
I dunno.

1122
01:28:55.751 --> 01:28:58.085
The stupid bitch passed the right truck twice

1123
01:28:58.292 --> 01:28:59.460
but didn’t pick up the scent.

1124
01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:01.045
Speak German

1125
01:29:01.128 --> 01:29:01.712
I did

1126
01:29:01.921 --> 01:29:03.923
I think this dog’s just no good anymore.

1127
01:29:04.548 --> 01:29:05.841
We need to get rid of her...

1128
01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:07.770
Now it fucking uses its nose?!

1129
01:29:07.770 --> 01:29:09.387
Now it fucking uses its nose?!

1130
01:29:19.991 --> 01:29:20.909
Faas!

1131
01:29:29.084 --> 01:29:30.627
Watch your back, Rosser.

1132
01:30:41.781 --> 01:30:42.782
Hey, man.

1133
01:30:44.159 --> 01:30:45.368
I just want my dog.

1134
01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.121
She isn't yours anymore.

1135
01:31:05.889 --> 01:31:06.890
Call her.

1136
01:31:07.891 --> 01:31:09.392
Go ahead, call her.

1137
01:31:13.563 --> 01:31:14.898
Socks. Hier.

1138
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:21.154
Socks! Come!

1139
01:31:24.324 --> 01:31:26.326
Socks.

1140
01:31:26.409 --> 01:31:27.619
Hier.

1141
01:31:27.702 --> 01:31:28.745
Come here, girl.

1142
01:31:28.828 --> 01:31:29.829
Come on.

1143
01:31:33.166 --> 01:31:34.084
Socks!

1144
01:31:35.585 --> 01:31:36.503
Come on.

1145
01:31:48.098 --> 01:31:49.557
She belongs to me.

1146
01:31:51.768 --> 01:31:52.978
Hmm?

1147
01:32:12.539 --> 01:32:13.498
You're right.

1148
01:32:13.581 --> 01:32:14.708
I know. I know.

1149
01:32:14.791 --> 01:32:15.959
She's yours.

1150
01:32:17.335 --> 01:32:18.837
Fuck this.

1151
01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.672
Kill me.

1152
01:32:20.755 --> 01:32:23.133
Put me out on my misery.
Sic your dogs on me.

1153
01:32:27.345 --> 01:32:28.346
What was it you said
the other day?

1154
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:29.889
Our side or suicide?

1155
01:32:32.225 --> 01:32:34.311
I guess it's suicide then, huh?

1156
01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.567
Suicide. That's a funny word, huh?

1157
01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:42.360
Very.

1158
01:32:42.444 --> 01:32:43.445
What is suicide in German?

1159
01:32:43.528 --> 01:32:45.071
You speak German, don't you?

1160
01:32:45.155 --> 01:32:46.156
What is it?

1161
01:32:46.239 --> 01:32:47.866
Selbstmord.

1162
01:33:16.061 --> 01:33:17.187
No answers yet

1163
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:19.189
about the human remains
of five victims

1164
01:33:19.272 --> 01:33:21.816
discovered among
100 million tons of garbage

1165
01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:23.568
in an area landfill.

1166
01:33:23.651 --> 01:33:26.654
Investigators say the bodies
are so badly decomposed,

1167
01:33:26.738 --> 01:33:28.823
it could take months
to uncover the identity

1168
01:33:28.907 --> 01:33:31.409
of these victims, if ever.

1169
01:33:31.493 --> 01:33:33.036
In our continuing
coverage of this story,

1170
01:33:33.119 --> 01:33:35.622
we will, of course,
keep you updated.

1171
01:33:47.342 --> 01:33:48.802
This is nothing.

1172
01:33:48.885 --> 01:33:50.720
Did I ever tell you
how hot Iraq gets?

1173
01:33:52.847 --> 01:33:55.308
One hundred and thirty!

1174
01:33:55.392 --> 01:33:56.601
And I'm not talking
like two days a year.

1175
01:33:56.684 --> 01:33:58.228
I'm talking about
every single day,

1176
01:33:58.311 --> 01:33:59.687
a hundred and thirty degrees.

1177
01:33:59.771 --> 01:34:01.398
You could literally
fry an egg on a rock...

1178
01:34:01.481 --> 01:34:03.608
You could have eggs,
as many as you want.

1179
01:34:03.691 --> 01:34:07.028
If you carried eggs
around Iraq, you know,

1180
01:34:07.112 --> 01:34:09.030
you had a dozen eggs
for the day, you know?

1181
01:34:09.114 --> 01:34:11.574
And, uh-- you are just
walking around Iraq,

1182
01:34:11.658 --> 01:34:15.370
you could literally
fry up an egg every single hour

1183
01:34:15.453 --> 01:34:17.372
and have an egg, fried egg,
every single hour.

1184
01:34:17.455 --> 01:34:18.915
You'd just throw it
on the ground, boom.

1185
01:34:18.998 --> 01:34:20.375
You got a fried egg.

1186
01:34:20.458 --> 01:34:22.377
If you carried some, you know,
some rice and some beans,

1187
01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:23.670
you'd have a little taco.

1188
01:34:26.047 --> 01:34:27.799
I mean, not that you would
actually wanna eat it...

1189
01:34:30.635 --> 01:34:31.678
well, you actually might.

1190
01:34:31.761 --> 01:34:33.221
You seem to want to eat everything.

1191
01:34:34.222 --> 01:34:35.682
Mama's waiting for us.

1192
01:40:06.888 --> 01:40:09.891
