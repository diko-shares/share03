00:00:00,688 --> 00:00:04,525
What a mighty God
What a mighty God

2
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:08,195
What a mighty God
we serve

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:10,196
He's mighty
He's mighty

4
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:12,241
He's a mighty God
He's a mighty God

5
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:14,159
He's mighty
He's mighty

6
00:00:14,244 --> 00:00:16,495
He's a mighty God
He's a mighty God

7
00:00:16,578 --> 00:00:19,915
What a mighty God
What a mighty God

8
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:27,214
What a mighty God
we serve

9
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:30,591
So, I have
an audition later today,

10
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:33,009
but I don't think I'll go
because I'll never get it.

11
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:35,513
But you're Working with
a casting director. That's huge.

12
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:38,014
See, that's what
I thought, too.

13
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:39,809
And they do get me
some auditions,

14
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:42,019
but I'm up against
the same 15 girls.

15
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:43,728
And they alWays
get the part.

16
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:46,232
Yeah, maybe,
but they're not Joy.

17
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:51,194
Yeah, Well, me, I've got a lot of good
shit happening off of my YouTube page.

18
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:53,530
In fact, I'm meeting
with a producer today

19
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:56,448
about putting together
an independent film.

20
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:57,784
What?

21
00:00:58,035 --> 00:00:59,119
Yeah. Uh...

22
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:04,791
I have an idea
for a short.

23
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:07,793
It's about
a legendary director

24
00:01:07,878 --> 00:01:10,421
who suddenly dies
while filming his movie.

25
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:14,383
So his inadequate son decides to
honor his father by finishing the film,

26
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:18,262
but the only help he has is
this misfit cast of characters,

27
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:19,888
like, straight out
of a Wes Anderson.

28
00:01:19,972 --> 00:01:23,267
It's The Life Aquatic meets
The Bad and the Beautiful.

29
00:01:23,768 --> 00:01:25,768
Sounds really
artistic, Neil.

30
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,480
Well, I think so.

31
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:30,190
Hopefully,
Sundance agrees.

32
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:51,960
Small place.
Yeah.

33
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,587
You want some coffee
or some water?

34
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,714
I'm all right. You don't
want to see me on coffee.

35
00:01:55,798 --> 00:01:56,882
Wired enough as is.

36
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:58,342
Take a seat.

37
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,552
The script is good.

38
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:02,846
Thank you.

39
00:02:02,972 --> 00:02:07,142
It's, you knoW, a labor of love of
mine and it's not quite there yet.

40
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,602
I Would be honored
to take it on.

41
00:02:09,686 --> 00:02:14,774
We don't often do shorts, but, in
your case, we'll make an exception.

42
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,610
Eddie, that's...
That's amazing!

43
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:20,738
NoW... NoW, let's talk about the budget.

44
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:23,366
Yeah, let's talk about it.
Let's talk about the budget.

45
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,951
HoW are you gonna
raise the money?

46
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:31,541
This is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here.

47
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,460
I don't understand. Shouldn't
he be giving you the money?

48
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:35,919
Isn't that what
producers do?

49
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:39,589
He's not the financier. He's the
producer. And there's a difference.

50
00:02:39,674 --> 00:02:41,675
All I need you to do is
kick in, like, five grand.

51
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,801
And I knoW. I'm aware.

52
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:45,177
I'm aware that's a lot of
money. I really get it. I get it.

53
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:48,265
But, you knoW, Eddie says
we could even, you knoW...

54
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:51,101
We could sell it to
television and make a profit.

55
00:02:51,185 --> 00:02:52,602
You gotta trust me
on this one, Dad.

56
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:55,146
I'd be shooting on a
real film and everything.

57
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,650
I mean, Dad... I mean,
this is the real deal, Dad.

58
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:01,527
The real deal, huh?
You think so?

59
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,241
Come on, Dad.

60
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:09,367
Help a brother out.

61
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:17,250
So this is what it's like
to have a social life?

62
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:19,335
Yeah, Well, it beats memorizing
Shakespeare, doesn't it?

63
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,546
Yeah.

64
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:24,132
HoW long do We
have to stay here?

65
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:26,176
I don't knoW. Come on,
let's just have fun.

66
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,677
We haven't been
out in a while.

67
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:28,887
Okay.

68
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:32,223
I'll get us some drinks. Okay.

69
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:48,947
Well, look who it is.

70
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:51,450
Andy! Hey!
Hey! Um...

71
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,160
Jenny. Jenny. That's right. Of course.

72
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:55,620
I remember you
from last year.

73
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:58,372
You did the shoW with
the monologue from...

74
00:03:58,457 --> 00:03:59,541
From Proof, right?

75
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:00,583
Yeah!
BF

76
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:03,212
Yeah, you Were
really good.

77
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:06,214
Thank you.
You're Welcome.

78
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:08,925
So hoW is P.A.?
I kind of miss it.

79
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:11,302
It's the same-old,
same-old.

80
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,888
But I've been watching you on your shoW.

81
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:15,139
Oh, really?
Yeah.

82
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:18,226
Well, thanks. Yeah,
it's going pretty Well.

83
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:20,394
I got a big storyline
right noW, so...

84
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,313
Andy.
It's kind of bloWing up.

85
00:04:22,397 --> 00:04:24,231
We're slamming shots, bro. Yeah. Shots.

86
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:27,025
Give me one second. I'm
talking to Jenny. Um...

87
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:28,276
You want to take shots?

88
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,402
I'm good, thanks.

89
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:31,571
Are you sure? Okay.
Yeah.

90
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:36,201
You knoW, they're looking
for day players on the shoW.

91
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:38,537
Would that be something
you might be interested in?

92
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:41,956
Seriously? Yeah. I mean,
I could put in a good Word.

93
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:46,168
Yeah! That
Would be perfect. Thank you.

94
00:04:46,378 --> 00:04:49,088
Okay. So hoW should we do this?
Do you Want to give me your number?

95
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:50,924
Yeah, I don't think
I have a pen or a...

96
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:54,093
No, no, don't Worry about it.
Just put it right in here.

97
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:55,678
Okay.

98
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:58,305
Um...

99
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,015
I think that's it.

100
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,685
Yeah, I can do this.
Yeah, I don't... Yeah, okay.

101
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,272
Perfect. Well, it's so good
to see you. You look great.

102
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:07,605
Thanks. You, too.

103
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:08,773
All right.
I'll see you later.

104
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:10,693
Okay.

105
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:12,862
Bye.
See you.

106
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:17,740
See you.

107
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:21,452
Shots up.
Ready to go.

108
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,955
One, two, three!
One, two, three!

109
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,125
All We Were doing
was talking, okay?

110
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:29,961
He saw my monologue
from P.A.

111
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:32,755
That's all We were talking
about. He Wants to help me.

112
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,049
God, could you possibly
be that naive?

113
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,550
He's trying to hook up
with you, Jenny.

114
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:38,469
That's ridiculous.
He's a big-time actor.

115
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:40,345
He can hook up
with whoever he wants.

116
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,015
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, he loves
your talent. That's what he loves.

117
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:47,603
So it's that preposterous that somebody
might actually like me for my talent?

118
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:50,522
No, of course not.

119
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:54,234
Look, no one believes in you
more than I do, and you knoW that.

120
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:57,445
Honestly, it's just the
Way he Was looking at you.

121
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,614
Fine.

122
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,660
If it means that much to you, I
Won't talk to him ever again. Promise.

123
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,456
NoW let's get
out of here.

124
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,167
We can go to my
dad's apartment.

125
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:12,585
What, noW?
Mmm-hmm.

126
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:14,878
He's on a date.

127
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:17,632
He Won't be back
until later.

128
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:39,443
There's definitely
something there.

129
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:42,071
Something that
could be interesting.

130
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:47,159
Check it out. We've got
an A&R meeting next Week.

131
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:49,119
What I'd like to do
is play it for the team,

132
00:06:49,204 --> 00:06:51,038
see what kind of
feedback We get,

133
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:52,664
and I'll get
back to you.

134
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:53,791
Nice.

135
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,752
Yo, yo, did you see him
bobbing his head?

136
00:06:56,836 --> 00:06:59,295
He Was bobbing his head to
himself. He Was bobbing...

137
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:01,965
Guys, guys. He didn't say he wanted us.

138
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:04,884
Did you not hear what he
said? He said, "Interesting. "

139
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:06,386
Interesting!
Man, We are so in.

140
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,222
Yo, I'm gonna give my moms a
house in the Hamptons on the beach.

141
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:11,015
Guys?
It's gonna be crazy.

142
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:17,730
You're not
even trying, Rosie.

143
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:22,067
Ballet is a requirement for every
student dancer in this school.

144
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:24,111
But, Ms. Kraft,
I'm good at hip-hop!

145
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:29,324
My job isn't to cast music videos.
It's to train serious dancers.

146
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:32,744
P.A. Isn't about just
doing whatever you Want.

147
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,706
It's about becoming
a complete performer.

148
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,209
I... I don't knoW
where you fit in here.

149
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:41,587
Fit in here? What's
that supposed to mean?

150
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,339
It means you're gonna keep flailing
around and you're not gonna...

151
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:46,257
This isn't about me,
is it?

152
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:48,176
You don't like my body.
Admit it!

153
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,346
Don't be ridiculous. Modern companies
are full of girls who don't have the...

154
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,475
Oh, really? Then hoW come this department
is filled with skinny little girls

155
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:59,312
with no titties and tight little butts,
Walking around drinking Diet Coke?

156
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,106
I ain't never gonna be like
them. And I don't wanna be.

157
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,233
You Want girls who've
been starving themselves,

158
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,069
and look like they're 11
and have so little body fat

159
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,821
they can't even get a period
to dance parts for real Women.

160
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,156
And that sucks!

161
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,951
You're part of a machinery of
oppression, Ms. Kraft. Just admit it.

162
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:19,581
Hey! First of all, don't
speak to me like that.

163
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,709
Don't speak to any teacher
like that. It's very rude.

164
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,169
It's also very ugly.

165
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,797
And second of all,
you knoW that's not true.

166
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,631
I Want my dancers
to be healthy,

167
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:31,717
and I talk to you all
about that all the time.

168
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,345
You don't have
a good technique,

169
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,431
and you're not Working
toward a technique.

170
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,892
And yet,
I Wanna keep you here.

171
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:42,228
Shit.

172
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,400
Jenny! Guess what.

173
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:50,610
What?

174
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:51,779
I got a job.

175
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:52,987
You're kidding!

176
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:55,990
I've been trying to find you to tell
you that it's the best shoW ever,

177
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:57,660
and I'm only
semi-regular at first,

178
00:08:57,743 --> 00:08:59,160
but then they said
I could get a lead,

179
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:01,287
and it's so amazing
you Won't believe it.

180
00:09:01,372 --> 00:09:03,413
Yay! Okay.
So what shoW is it?

181
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:04,873
Sesame Street.

182
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,459
Holy shit.
That shoW's still on?

183
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:08,418
I'm gonna
get paid to act.

184
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:09,671
That's incredible!

185
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:11,089
You bitch.

186
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:14,133
I Wonder if they need any hot,
young, neW, macho director types.

187
00:09:14,217 --> 00:09:17,177
I mean, I knoW they're alWays
looking for neW talent on that shoW.

188
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:18,554
I don't think so.

189
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:21,431
But if you're really nice
and give me back rubs,

190
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:23,350
I might let you be
part of my entourage.

191
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:25,519
Ooh, back rubs.
You mean like...

192
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:29,231
Oh, I'm sorry, did that hurt? I'm sorry.

193
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:39,533
Yeah. You knoW what?

194
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:42,411
Singing in front of all of
your friends in the classroom

195
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,787
is one thing,
but noW We're here.

196
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:46,247
And you guys
are gonna sing

197
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:50,168
in front of this lovely
group of total strangers,

198
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:53,879
who actually are sort of hoping
that you'll be really bad.

199
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,298
It's gonna be great.

200
00:09:56,966 --> 00:10:00,845
Also, try to have fun, because
it's part of your grade.

201
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,433
I get knocked

202
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:08,226

00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,936
I get knocked doWn
But I get up again

204
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:13,356
You're never

205
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:22,157
Pissing the night aWay

206
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:24,326
I have a tendency
to Wear my mind on my sleeve

207
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:26,495
I have a history
of losing my shirt

208
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:28,746
It's been one Week
since you looked at me

209
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,956
Cocked your head to the
side and said, "I'm sorry"

210
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,459
Five days since
you laughed at me

211
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:36,796
Three days since
the living room

212
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,215
It'll still be two days
till We say We're sorry

213
00:10:41,343 --> 00:10:43,927
Two days till... Sorry

214
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:49,098
All right! WoW. Thank

So tonight, I Would
love to donate my time.

00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:54,938
I'm gonna do a little
something special.

217
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,565
I'm gonna give my time over to
someone very important to us.

218
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,527
Our teacher and hero...
No.

219
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:03,779
...Ms. Fran Rowan!

220
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:05,114
No!

221
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,742
Yes! It's all you.
You brought us here.

222
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:10,452
That's our teacher!

223
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:12,204
Yeah, thank you.

224
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:13,664
Shake it.

225
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:18,877
Oh, God.
HoW did this happen?

226
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:22,213
Okay, you're expelled.
Hope it Was Worth it.

227
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,384
Oh, no. All right,
I don't even knoW...

228
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:31,181
Do you have You Took Advantage
of Me by Rodgers and Hart?

229
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,141
Say no. Please say no.
Yep. We have it!

230
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,725
They have it!

231
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,936
Good. Perfect!

232
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:39,564
Yeah, Rodgers and Hart.

233
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,693
A mental deficient

234
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:45,610
You will grade me

235
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:50,366
I've given you
plenty of data

236
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:57,247
You came, you saw,
you slayed me

237
00:11:57,707 --> 00:12:04,044
And that-a is that-a!

238
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:16,725
I'm a sentimental sap,
that's all

239
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,188
What's the use of
trying not to fall?

240
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:25,441
I have no will

241
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:28,569
You've made your kill

242
00:12:28,944 --> 00:12:33,073
'Cause you took
advantage of me

243
00:12:33,157 --> 00:12:36,242
She's amazing!

244
00:12:36,327 --> 00:12:37,577
Of course she is.

245
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:40,873
I'm so hot and bothered,
that I don't knoW

246
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:45,001
My elboW from my ear

247
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:52,424
I suffer something awful
every time you go

248
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:57,346
It's Worse
when you're near

249
00:12:57,765 --> 00:13:04,394
Here am I with all
my bridges burned

250
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:10,025
Just a babe in arms
where you're concerned

251
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:12,902
So lock the doors

252
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:14,655
Lock that door!

253
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:20,536
And call me yours

254
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:26,207
Because you took

255
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:33,214
You took advantage of me

256
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:42,973
Oh, my God,
that Was amazing!

257
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,641
Why are you guys
so boring in class

258
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:46,643
and so great at
karaoke tonight?

259
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:49,147
Why didn't you ever bring us
there before? That was so much fun.

260
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,605
I knoW. I should've
done it before.

261
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,858
You knoW, that Was so great,
because it's not about you.

262
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:55,152
It's about the audience, and I
really saw that. It Was great.

263
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:56,653
I knoW. You knoW what else is great?

264
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:58,822
That girl gave me her
number. That Was a guy, Neil.

265
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,532
Irregardless,
I was flattered.

266
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:03,118
Joy, you Were on fire. It
was unbelievable. Thank you.

267
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:05,744
I mean,
it Was so cute and good.

268
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:08,497
And completely
ambushed by Kevin.

269
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:09,582
Hat's off.
Wait, one thing.

270
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,292
HoW come you never sang in
front of us until tonight?

271
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:12,918
Oh, my God. Because I'm
the teacher. Seriously.

272
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:16,088
You should more often,
because you Were stellar, man.

273
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:18,757
I mean, I'm inspired.
Speaking of...

274
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,010
So do you ever perform,
ever? Like...

275
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,135
Do I what?

276
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,595
Recently, any of these
days, do you ever perform?

277
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,347
No, no. No, no, no.
You should.

278
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,765
Yeah.
Gosh.

279
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:29,602
Especially for your
students. Well, why...

280
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,103
No, no. Too much.
Can't...

281
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:32,896
Why did you quit?
Huh?

282
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,689
Why did you quit?

283
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,566
It's... Why did I...
Um...

284
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,651
She's like, "What... "

285
00:14:39,736 --> 00:14:43,031
It's not a good... It's a boring
story. It's long and boring.

286
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,283
No, really.
Why did you quit?

287
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:49,828
Um... Well, let's see.

288
00:14:49,913 --> 00:14:54,625
You knoW, I Went to college and I
Was a little, happy theater major

289
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,502
and all bright and
shiny and everything.

290
00:14:56,586 --> 00:15:01,298
And graduated from college
and moved to the big city

291
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:04,510
and started getting out there and
auditioning, and I did the whole thing.

292
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:09,806
You knoW, I did all the cattle
calls and the whole nine yards.

293
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:14,353
I don't knoW, after a while I
just kind of started feeling like

294
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:16,646
it really Wasn't
meant to be.

295
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:19,398
But, you knoW, I mean,

296
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:22,485
sometimes when I go see
a BroadWay musical,

297
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:25,153
I just kind of
sit there and think,

298
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:28,990
"You knoW,
I could've done that.

299
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:30,743
"I totally could've
done that. "

300
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:33,454
I think. I think.
I think I could've.

301
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:36,289
NoW, look, man, you said there Was
something interesting about it, though.

302
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,875
Yes. There is.

303
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:39,960
Her.

304
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:44,338
Look, you don't come across
a voice like that every day.

305
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:47,258
Hold up, man. She
didn't even want to sing!

306
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:50,761
Look, you need to find
different producers.

307
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:53,764
You knoW? Work with
Pharrell, Ronson, Timbaland.

308
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:56,935
No, look, I'm the producer, man.
I make the tracks, right? Me.

309
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:59,061
And I found her. She Wouldn't
even be here if it wasn't for me.

310
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:02,273
Look, guys, I'm sorry. That's
just the Way this business Works.

311
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:03,816
Look, you're young.

312
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:05,025
All right, you're
just getting started,

313
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,361
but right noW this is her time to shine.

314
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:11,949
Look. Give me an opportunity
to do this for you.

315
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:14,492
We're doing 360 deals
that will bloW your mind.

316
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:15,994
We just joint ventured
with Live Nation.

317
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,289
Clear Channel's giving us 1,000
spins of anybody that We Want.

318
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:20,999
Listen, I Worked on
Alicia Keys' record.

319
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,333
I Worked on
Lauryn Hill's record.

320
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:26,504
I knoW what to do for you. But
you gotta trust me. Let's do this.

321
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,800
Come on, let's go.

322
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:35,388
This is bullshit.
And you knoW it.

323
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:52,029
Wait, Wait.
Hold, hold on.

324
00:16:52,113 --> 00:16:53,864
NoW, you Were born to
do this. You knoW that.

325
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,866
You knoW what, thank you,
but I can't. I just can't...

326
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,991
I knoW they're
your friends.

327
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:59,536
But what I'm trying to do
for you could make you a star.

328
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:04,749
Look. Just take my card and
think about it, all right?

329
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:09,545
Denise!
You coming?

330
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,361
So, this is all I've been able
to come up with for the moment,

331
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:37,781
'cause my financiers
were slightly shalloW...

332
00:17:37,865 --> 00:17:40,742
Don't Worry about the money. I
mean, we'll shoot some scenes.

333
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:41,867
Okay.
We'll cut a mini-trailer.

334
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:44,120
We'll use that
to get more money.

335
00:17:44,205 --> 00:17:47,916
I'm feeling it. I mean, I've already
got this storyboard thing going with...

336
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,334
I've got some
visuals here.

337
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,043
I thought I could run this

I have a shot list in my bag
someWhere if you'd like to see it noW.

00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:56,006
You just get into your process. Sure.

00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:58,049
I've already talked to
my friends at Sundance.

341
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:01,010
This is exactly what
they're looking for.

342
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:06,808
That's incredible. Let's make
a movie. Let's make a movie.

Andy Matthews' trailer.

345
00:18:23,117 --> 00:18:24,159

Yeah.

347
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:27,161
Right this Way.

348
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,792
So what's going on?

349
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,418

00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:39,339
We Were gonna go see your
casting director, right?

351
00:18:40,592 --> 00:18:42,009

00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:45,846
Right. Yes. No, no, no. Totally.
She's actually out today.

353
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:47,972

WoW. I'm so sorry. Well, then I
should come back another time...

355
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:55,564
No, no, no, no. She said that We
could put a scene on tape for her.

356
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,442
Yeah. No, that's fine.
That's great.

357
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:01,611

It's...
Yeah, it's a scene where

363
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:20,921

So I told her a lot of
stuff about you, you knoW.

368
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:34,934
I told her you're the prettiest
girl at Performing Arts.

369
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:37,479
Thanks.
It's true.

370
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:41,775
So, what We're
gonna do here,

371
00:19:42,443 --> 00:19:44,276
we're just gonna slate.
Okay.

372
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:46,946
Okay. It's like name and age, and
then We'll get going with the scene.

373
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,155
Okay.

374
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:55,578
And go.

375
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:59,333
Hi, I'm Jenny Garrison
and I'm 17 years old.

376
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:02,502
Perfect.

377
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:12,178
And action.

378
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:16,516
"The music Was so loud,
I had to get out of there. "

379
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:20,436
"Well, Maddy, I'm so glad
you brought me with you.

380
00:20:20,855 --> 00:20:23,021
"You knoW hoW
I feel about you.

381
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:25,941
"Or at least
I hope you do. "

382
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:32,197
Andy, you actually have
still another line. Right.

383
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:36,952
Yeah, that line. I like to
improvise. It's kind of my thing.

384
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,119
You knoW?
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,872
No. It's okay. Just don't
stop the scene again.

386
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:43,417
Okay. You want to be an actress, right?

387
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:45,043
Right, of course.

388
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:47,295
You gotta be ready for
whatever they throW at you.

389
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,838
I mean, ourjob,
as actors,

390
00:20:48,922 --> 00:20:51,132
is to make the audience
believe what's really going on.

391
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,176
Right. I remember learning that at P.A.

392
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:55,887
Am I wrong? No, not at
all. That's exactly... Yeah.

393
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:58,181
No, that's it. Perfect.
Okay.

394
00:20:58,891 --> 00:20:59,932
Let's try it again?

395
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:01,516
Yep. Let's do it.

396
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:03,101
Okay.

397
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,272
And action.

398
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:08,982
The music Was so loud,
I had to get out of there.

399
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,985
Maddy, I'm so glad
you brought me with you.

400
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:15,322
I mean, you knoW
hoW I feel about you.

401
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:18,532
Or at least
I hope you do.

402
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:31,922
Andy.
Jesus, Jenny.

403
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:35,091
Look, I don't understand it.
You're not getting it.

404
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:38,886
I mean, do you knoW hoW many girls
Would die for this opportunity with me?

405
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,764
Yeah. And I'm sure you've had
every one of them in this trailer.

406
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:44,725
No, probably not
every one of them.

407
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:48,771
Look, is this even an audition or do
you have a collection of these tapes?

408
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:51,606
I might have a feW.

409
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:54,567
Look, Jenny.
No. You came here.

410
00:21:55,152 --> 00:21:56,694
Okay, what did you think
was gonna happen?

411
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:59,739
We Were gonna talk
about our craft?

412
00:21:59,824 --> 00:22:01,366
I don't do that.

413
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,785
Okay, you don't, but I do. Right.

414
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:05,120
No, look.
Stop it, okay!

415
00:22:05,162 --> 00:22:06,538
Can you just leave me alone? Jenny.

416
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:08,414
Just leave me alone!

417
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:21,468
Wait. Andy?
What about Andy?

418
00:22:23,513 --> 00:22:26,764
Andy invited me to set
to meet a casting director.

419
00:22:29,144 --> 00:22:31,978
And We Went into
his trailer. And...

420
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:33,980
Well, I...
Jenny.

421
00:22:34,773 --> 00:22:37,192
Well, did he try
something on you?

422
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:39,235
Kind of.

423
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,696
I kneW it! I kneW
this Was gonna happen.

424
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,072
Marco!
I told you

425
00:22:43,157 --> 00:22:44,782
about this asshole
from the beginning.

426
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:46,367
But you still Went
behind my back.

427
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,661
I knoW. And I'm sorry,
but I...

428
00:22:48,746 --> 00:22:51,914
Look, I thought that maybe if he
did Want to flirt, just a little bit,

429
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:53,499
that it Would be
fine if I...

430
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:55,710
What, if you got the job?

431
00:22:55,794 --> 00:22:56,918
You knoW what, Jenny?

432
00:22:57,003 --> 00:23:00,047
If becoming famous
is so important to you,

433
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:02,632
then go for it.
I'm done with this.

434
00:23:03,593 --> 00:23:05,552
Marco, I...
Hey, you knoW what?

435
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:08,721
I hope you really get
the role. I really do.

436
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:14,644
What do you mean, I
can't have my camera equipment?

437
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:17,063
You see, I already gave
the check to my producer.

438
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:18,647
So, this is a matter
of... Sir, there's no...

439
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:20,149
You are not registered
on the computer. Right.

440
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,734
Neither you nor your
producer are here. Okay.

441
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:22,819
I cannot do that.

442
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,779
At the same time, this
film is fully funded.

443
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:26,947
I don't care. It may
be. He just called me.

444
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,450
He goes, "Earl's gonna help you out.
"You're not helping me out, Earl.

445
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,911
I Would love to help you out, but
there's nothing I can do. I cannot...

446
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,370
You knoW what, let's
check the name again.

447
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,498
I've checked the name
already three times...

448
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,124
Please just check the name
again. Let's do it again. Come on.

449
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,044
B- A-C-Z-Y-N-S-K-Y.
I knoW hoW to spell it.

450
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,462
I tried it three times.
Earl, please help me here.

451
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:45,632
I Would love to help you, but it's
not there. There's nothing I can do.

452
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,396
Eddie, it's Neil.

453
00:24:33,387 --> 00:24:36,431
You remember hoW you asked me to write
you that letter of recommendation?

454
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:37,597
Of course.

455
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:39,724
Well...

456
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:43,813
I'm sorry, but I can't
write you that letter.

457
00:24:48,735 --> 00:24:53,072
Sometimes We get students
who are promising,

458
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:58,118
but they never progress
past that early promise.

459
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,886
If the fish
swam out of the ocean

460
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:19,638
I knoW you Want to
be a ballet dancer,

461
00:25:20,891 --> 00:25:24,559
but I don't believe that's
going to happen for you.

462
00:25:24,978 --> 00:25:27,520
Not on a professional level.

463
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:30,940
And the stars
fell out of the sky

464
00:25:31,025 --> 00:25:32,984
And my tears
rolled into the...

465
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:34,778
I Work harder
than anyone else.

466
00:25:34,862 --> 00:25:36,196
I'm sorry, Kevin.

467
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,616
You're just not
a strong enough dancer.

468
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:41,493
...set my World
into motion

469
00:25:41,577 --> 00:25:44,662
'Cause if you're
not really here

470
00:25:44,997 --> 00:25:47,165
You will never,
in my opinion,

471
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:51,252
be able to support
yourself as a dancer.

472
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:54,546
It's my responsibility
to tell you that.

473
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:57,174
Black and gold

474
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:23,491
Black and gold
Black and gold

475
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:25,701
Black and gold

476
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:40,466
'Cause if you're
not really here

477
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,635
You should continue
your year here at P.A.

478
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,887
But you need
to be prepared.

479
00:26:48,182 --> 00:26:51,267
Black and gold
Black and gold

480
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:55,521
Kevin, there are students
who are going to get picked up

481
00:26:55,605 --> 00:26:59,568
by Ailey, City Ballet,
Complexions.

482
00:27:00,026 --> 00:27:05,072
And there are other students who are
going to have to pursue other options.

483
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,076
Like,

484
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:13,914
you might make
a Wonderful teacher.

485
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:23,965
Maybe you're right. J EN
I knoW, I'm so proud of you.

486
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,010
It's Sesame Street. Okay, who
doesn't knoW Sesame Street?

487
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:30,555
Everybody greW up with it at
some point. Cookie Monster!

488
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:32,766
Okay, okay...

489
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:36,436
You made me Want you

490
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:44,944
And all the time
I guess you alWays kneW

491
00:27:45,612 --> 00:27:50,491
You made me
happy sometimes

492
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:55,621
You made me glad

493
00:27:56,081 --> 00:27:57,498
No.
No?

494
00:27:57,582 --> 00:27:59,333
See, there are some people
that like crispy cookies

495
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:00,834
and some people that like
gooey... I don't like...

496
00:28:00,918 --> 00:28:04,254
And so, if I could create my
perfect Sesame Street cast...

497
00:28:10,804 --> 00:28:14,306
No, see, you see, if I could make
my ideal Sesame Street cast...

498
00:28:22,897 --> 00:28:24,941
The puppets...

499
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:48,964
Kevin!

500
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:32,255
Did he call you again?

501
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:34,340
Yeah, he called me again.

502
00:29:36,093 --> 00:29:38,343
So does he Want you to
record an album or something?

503
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:43,599
Yeah. He wanted me to Work with Damon
and Poyser, whoever those people are.

504
00:29:46,728 --> 00:29:48,353
What'd you say?

505
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:49,772
I told him no.

506
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:51,690
Because of your pops?

507
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,442
No.

508
00:29:54,151 --> 00:29:55,778
What? Because of us?

509
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:57,570
Yes, because of us.

510
00:29:58,114 --> 00:30:01,282
It's you, me and Malik.
That's it. Package deal.

511
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:11,542
Denise, look, I... I don't Wanna
keep you from your dreams, all right?

512
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,212
That man's right,
you Were born to sing.

513
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:16,589
Jesus, Victor!
Enough already.

514
00:30:20,177 --> 00:30:21,843
Before you and Malik,

515
00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:23,887
I didn't even realize
I could sing that music.

516
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:25,972
That I loved that music.

517
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:30,519
I didn't even
knoW who I was.

518
00:30:30,603 --> 00:30:32,104
You guys
believed in me,

519
00:30:32,188 --> 00:30:34,981
so I'm not gonna
sell you out.

520
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,732
And that's that.

521
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,695
NoW, can We get
back to practice?

522
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:44,324
Yeah.

523
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:56,877
I've been calling you
and texting you.

524
00:30:56,962 --> 00:30:59,588
Left a feW messages and
you don't even respond.

525
00:30:59,673 --> 00:31:03,758
And I didn't see you at
school. What's up with that?

526
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:08,347
I'm sorry. It's been crazy. I've
been so busy getting ready and stuff.

527
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,017
Busy? Doing what?

528
00:31:14,603 --> 00:31:16,354
I got into Complexions.

529
00:31:17,064 --> 00:31:18,732
Complexions?
What's that?

530
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,236
Only the greatest modern
dance company in the World.

531
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,572
They Want me
for a World tour.

532
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,826
What?

533
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:32,620
Wait, are you serious?

534
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:33,746
Yeah.

535
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:37,916
Oh, my God.

536
00:31:39,126 --> 00:31:41,545
That's what I'm talking
about. What did I tell you?

537
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:43,338
It's gonna be
a lot of Work.

538
00:31:43,422 --> 00:31:46,008
I bet. What's it like?
Give me details.

539
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:49,052
Twenty-two cities. We
start rehearsing next Week.

540
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:51,345
Next Week?
What about school?

541
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,639
I'm dropping out.

542
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:57,018
Your parents
will let you?

543
00:31:57,102 --> 00:32:00,688
Are you kidding? They've put me
in dance class since I was five.

544
00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:01,856
They're thrilled.

545
00:32:02,107 --> 00:32:03,191
Oh.

546
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,611
That's great.

547
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:10,447
I knoW I should have told
you sooner, Victor. I'm sorry.

548
00:32:11,949 --> 00:32:15,286
We'll still, like... We'll
still see each other, right?

549
00:32:15,913 --> 00:32:19,122
When you come back to
visit your parents. Right?

550
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:23,250
Alice, baby, come on.

551
00:32:23,336 --> 00:32:27,047
Victor, listen.
It's not just us.

552
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:30,258
A lot of my friends
say that after P.A.,

553
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:33,845
you just go on
your separate Ways.

554
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,474
It's just the Way
the World Works, Victor.

555
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:41,352
That's just
hoW it Works?

556
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:15,134
Hey, Malik.

557
00:33:15,885 --> 00:33:18,011
What happened
to your dad?

558
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:21,265
What?

559
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:24,518
Your dad. Where is he?

560
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:28,689
Mrs. Simms?

561
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:30,899
Joy. Come in.

562
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:35,612
Have a seat, dear.

563
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:36,864
Come here.

564
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,451
Come and have a seat.
I Want to talk to you.

565
00:33:41,535 --> 00:33:44,537
I think We both knoW
why I asked to see you.

566
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:47,290
Your grades.

567
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:53,421
I'm your teacher, Malik.
And I want an ansWer.

568
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:00,511
The oldest story in the
book, all right? He left.

569
00:34:03,097 --> 00:34:07,392
After Ayanna Was born. Didn't
even come back for her funeral.

570
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:13,648
Was there anyone there
to take his place?

571
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:18,653
I tried to make it work for
as long as I possibly could.

572
00:34:18,738 --> 00:34:19,780
I knoW.

573
00:34:19,863 --> 00:34:21,989
You knoW hoW I
feel about P.A.

574
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:25,202
But I'm Working on the
shoW all the time noW.

575
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,662
And I... I just...

576
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:33,375
I don't knoW
what to do.

577
00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:36,379
Everything you're
ashamed of,

578
00:34:36,463 --> 00:34:40,299
all the parts of yourself
that you keep secret,

579
00:34:40,384 --> 00:34:44,303
everything you Want to
change about yourself,

580
00:34:44,388 --> 00:34:46,388
it's who you are.

581
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:49,182
That's your power.

582
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:53,353
Deny it
and you're nothing.

583
00:34:53,437 --> 00:34:57,732
And you'll never be
much of an actor.

584
00:34:59,527 --> 00:35:03,071
This school is here to
develop you as an artist.

585
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:06,408
And when you're ready, send
you out there to go to Work.

586
00:35:07,617 --> 00:35:09,118
Are you ready?

587
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:15,624
NoW, you're good, Malik.

588
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:20,045
But you've got to start
breaking doWn those Walls

589
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:24,717
and accept
your circumstances.

590
00:35:27,721 --> 00:35:29,512
Just tell the truth.

591
00:35:31,181 --> 00:35:33,559
Nobody cares
about that shit.

592
00:35:34,852 --> 00:35:36,478
Yeah, maybe so.

593
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:40,189
But I do.

594
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,773
You all right?

595
00:36:22,856 --> 00:36:24,565
Why the hell are
you so nervous?

596
00:36:28,278 --> 00:36:29,320
Cool.
You invited them.

597
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:31,362
No, not exactly.

598
00:36:31,907 --> 00:36:33,741
What does that mean?

599
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,952
I told them some kids
from school were performing

600
00:36:38,037 --> 00:36:40,498
who Were, I don't
knoW, musically gifted.

601
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:43,250
Wait, so they don't knoW
you're singing tonight?

602
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:44,501
No.

603
00:36:45,669 --> 00:36:47,962
But do they knoW
it's hip hop?

604
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,424
I told them,
"Classical jazz. "

605
00:36:55,971 --> 00:36:58,098
Oh, it's gonna be
good tonight.

606
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,516
Oh, yeah.

607
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:02,643
You sure you don't Want
anything to drink?

608
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:05,979
I'd love one, but I'm gonna be
paying my dad back till I'm 30.

609
00:37:06,065 --> 00:37:07,940
I can't afford a drink.

610
00:37:08,024 --> 00:37:10,692
You don't mind if I have a
sip of yours, though, right?

611
00:37:10,777 --> 00:37:12,027
Look who it is.
Look who it is.

612
00:37:13,822 --> 00:37:15,197
Mr. Dowd.

613
00:37:25,082 --> 00:37:27,459
Yeah, sorry, guys,
I gotta go.

614
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:36,509
HoW've you been?

615
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:37,802
I've been okay.

616
00:37:39,263 --> 00:37:40,763
That's good.

617
00:37:43,266 --> 00:37:45,810
I've been thinking
a lot about you.

618
00:37:46,853 --> 00:37:48,979
Yeah, I have, too.

619
00:37:49,772 --> 00:37:52,357
I think about
hoW I hurt you

620
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:55,777
and it kills me.
I'm so sorry.

621
00:37:56,362 --> 00:38:00,115
I Went there for all the wrong
reasons and I knoW that noW.

622
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:03,784
Things will probably never
be the same between us, but...

623
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:07,621
Mike check,
one-two, one-two.

624
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:10,207
Do you think you'll ever
be able to forgive me?

625
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:12,334
Hey, guys, the shoW's
about to start.

626
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:13,878
Coming.

627
00:38:14,463 --> 00:38:15,713
Listen.

628
00:38:16,339 --> 00:38:19,592
Let's just talk about this later. Okay?

629
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:22,260
All right.

630
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:27,808
Yo, what up,
everyone? HoW y'all feeling tonight?

631
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:29,684
Come on,
let me hear y'all.

632
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,977
Yeah!

633
00:38:31,062 --> 00:38:33,354
Come on, y'all can
do better than that.

634
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,816
Look, look, look. We got a
special group for y'all tonight,

635
00:38:36,901 --> 00:38:39,027
straight out of the
Performing Arts High School.

636
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:41,196
HoW y'all feel
about that?

637
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,447
I got a question for y'all.

638
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:45,699
HoW many people here have
gone to the Performing Arts?

639
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:47,910
Okay, raise your hands.
Let me see. Let me see.

640
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:51,998
I see you. Okay, one,
two, ten. Okay, good, good.

641
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:55,167
So look, look, tonight is
their first performance ever...

642
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:58,337
Good luck, girl... so try
not to be too mean, all right?

643
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:01,340
Just give it up, people.
Give it up.

644
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:06,595
You Want
to knoW my life?

645
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,389
Well let me give you
a backdrop

646
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,640
I was born in
the era of the flattop

647
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,975
Low-cut Air Jordans
with the black socks

648
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,228
When Run-DMC was
chilling with Ad-Rock

649
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:17,564
Mom was broke and
Dad did crack rock

650
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:21,067
So I hit the streets to keep the
padlock off our apartment door

651
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:22,735
Me and my mans
holding the 'four

652
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,404
Standing in front
of the stash spot

653
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:26,739
Until one day
my little sister got popped

654
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:29,074
It took aWay my
whole life in a snapshot

655
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:32,537
And it might sound gory But
that's the unfortunate story

656
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,246
Between the "haves"
and the "have-nots"

657
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,915
Between the "gots"
and the "ain't-gots"

658
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,417
I was tired of not
getting so I got on the go

659
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,711
Everybody Worldwide
got to get it for sure

660
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,921
Get on yourjob, get on
your grind Get on the flo'

661
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,674
NoW let's go

662
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,216
Yeah, come on

663
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:50,846
Baby, get on the
floor Come and shake it with me

664
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:55,100
So high

665
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,978
we ain't coming doWn
Baby, get on the floor

666
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,479
'Cause I knoW you believe
Yeah

667
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:04,775
We've come too far to turn
back noW Tell them, baby

668
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,194
Don't want to think
about yesterday

669
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,530
Or the time
that slipped aWay

670
00:40:09,613 --> 00:40:11,949
Or the things
that people say

671
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,076
'Cause I'm just living
my life Living my life

672
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,454
And I can have anything
if I choose it

673
00:40:16,538 --> 00:40:20,415
And I'm ready and willing to

Daddy...
Denise, I can't believe

719
00:42:51,978 --> 00:42:53,102
you tricked us into
coming here tonight.

720
00:42:53,187 --> 00:42:54,188
I thought it Was
a school event.

721
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,521
I had to. There was
no other choice.

722
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:57,066
And who Were those boys
you Were up there with?

723
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,316
They're my friends. I...

724
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,194
And when the hell
did you start singing?

725
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:04,197
I just Want you to knoW that
this is completely unacceptable.

726
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:07,784
You knoW what? If you can't accept
this, then you can't accept me.

727
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:09,702
Because this is who I am.

728
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,205
Playing piano isn't enough
for me anymore, Daddy.

729
00:43:12,288 --> 00:43:14,498
Sitting in an orchestra,
invisible. I hate it!

730
00:43:14,582 --> 00:43:16,334
That's it! I'm pulling
you out of that school.

731
00:43:16,418 --> 00:43:17,710
I don't care if there's
three months left.

732
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,295
But... What?
No.

733
00:43:19,504 --> 00:43:23,965
I have been Watching Denise play the
piano all her life and she is good.

734
00:43:24,343 --> 00:43:28,095
And she practices and she's done
everything we asked her to do.

735
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:29,679
But she doesn't love it.

736
00:43:29,764 --> 00:43:31,640
She Went to school
to be...

737
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:40,482
You will stay at that school and
We will support you no matter what.

738
00:43:40,566 --> 00:43:41,607
NoW, Wait...

739
00:43:41,692 --> 00:43:44,026
There will be no
more discussion.

740
00:43:55,956 --> 00:43:58,833
There are some things
success is not.

741
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:02,377
It's not fame.
It's not money or power.

742
00:44:04,547 --> 00:44:07,298
Success is Waking up
in the morning

743
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:09,844
so excited about
what you have to do

744
00:44:10,344 --> 00:44:13,012
that you literally
fly out the door.

745
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:16,850
It's getting to Work
with people you love.

746
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:23,148
Success is connecting with the
World and making people feel.

747
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,525
It's finding a Way to
bind together people

748
00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:29,153
who have nothing in
common but a dream.

749
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:33,032
It's falling asleep at night knoWing
you did the best job you could.

750
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,327
Success is joy and
freedom and friendship.

751
00:44:41,082 --> 00:44:42,916
And success is love.

752
00:44:46,046 --> 00:44:48,047
What are you doing here?
You're not graduating.

753
00:44:48,131 --> 00:44:51,132
True, but my best friend is.
I bought you a present.

754
00:44:51,216 --> 00:44:53,301
Oh, my God!
Where did you find this?

755
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:56,304
I thought the Gucci print might be a little
too much, but I thought you'd like it.

756
00:44:56,388 --> 00:44:58,056
No, it's perfect.

757
00:45:05,064 --> 00:45:07,398
What happened to
all your stuff?

758
00:45:10,235 --> 00:45:12,362
It all Went home already.

759
00:45:13,154 --> 00:45:14,821
What do you mean?

760
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:18,533
I'm going back to Iowa.

761
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,495
But I thought We talked
about you staying here,

762
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:23,162
doing dance class
and BroadWay...

763
00:45:23,247 --> 00:45:24,873
Joy, Joy, Joy.

764
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:28,084
I'm lucky.
I have a place to go.

765
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,214
I'm gonna take over
my mom's dance studio.

766
00:45:32,714 --> 00:45:36,634
And I'm gonna be the best goddamn
dance teacher there ever was.

767
00:45:45,268 --> 00:45:48,270
Four years of
ups and doWns,

768
00:45:48,939 --> 00:45:52,775
of Wonderment
and disappointment,

769
00:45:53,652 --> 00:45:55,778
of ennui and joy.

770
00:45:57,114 --> 00:46:00,907
It Was everything
I'd ever hoped for.

771
00:46:03,786 --> 00:46:05,286
And scene.

772
00:46:07,914 --> 00:46:10,916
Congratulations!
Can I take a picture?

773
00:46:17,465 --> 00:46:18,632

No time for games
Time to decide

868
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:18,705
The pressure's on

869
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,625
It's got to be right

870
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:24,461
Won't be detoured
by foolish pride

871
00:56:25,963 --> 00:56:27,798
Gotta Work just a little

872
00:56:27,882 --> 00:56:29,675
Just a peek
for something committal

873
00:56:29,801 --> 00:56:31,509
Got to find
someWhere in the middle

874
00:56:31,594 --> 00:56:33,887
So confusing with my feelings

875
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:35,888
I'm just lost in the fever

876
00:56:35,973 --> 00:56:37,932
It takes time
for true feelings

877
00:56:38,016 --> 00:56:39,643
But I can't seem to fight it

878
00:56:39,727 --> 00:56:41,811

00:56:41,979 --> 00:56:44,106

But you don't measure up

884
00:56:54,449 --> 00:56:57,826

I'm on the spot
Today's the day

893
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:25,602
Decision time
What should I do?

894
00:57:25,687 --> 00:57:29,023
Should I deny
or give in to?

895
00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:32,067
Gotta Work just a little

896
00:57:32,444 --> 00:57:34,486
