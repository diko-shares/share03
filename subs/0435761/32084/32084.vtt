1
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:04,380
- What shall I have?
- I don't know.

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:07,550
- I'm not hungry.
- How about a steak?

3
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:11,721
- That's a good idea.
- Chateaubriand?

4
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:14,516
- Or filet mignon?
- Chateaubriand.

5
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,395
Two of them.

6
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:22,899
- Rare or medium rare?
- Rare.

7
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,275
Rare.

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,153
- Warm.
- Of course.

9
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:32,367
What time did you
leave Monte Carlo?

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,578
I left at...

11
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:40,333
Nothing to start with?

12
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,418
No, thanks.

13
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:49,050
He's upset that
we're not ordering more.

14
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,177
Want to make him happy?

15
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,273
Do you have any rooms?

16
00:03:57,363 --> 00:04:02,577
This movie was my way
of wishing you a Happy New Year.

17
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,562
Warden, tell them
to open the doors.

18
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:33,941
Egotist. You'll never
fool them with that.

19
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:37,695
Ever heard
of black shoe polish?

20
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,656
Yeah, I've heard of it.

21
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:45,745
Before the movie,
they'll frisk us good.

22
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:49,582
200 guys will celebrate
New Year's Eve at home tonight.

23
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,920
You're an egotist
and an idealist.

24
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:57,590
You'll just spoil it
for everybody.

25
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,722
Simon,
report to the warden.

26
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,318
What's the movie tonight?

27
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,612
Some love story.

28
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:36,754
- They're all here.
- Bring them in.

29
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:50,142
Gentlemen, I wanted
to offer you my best wishes...

30
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:54,730
...for good health
and prosperity,

31
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:59,235
...for liberty and honesty.

32
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:05,241
This may surprise you,
since you are prisoners,

33
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:09,620
...but as you know,
every year at this time,

34
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:13,833
...paroles are granted.
And you three...

35
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:18,045
...have been granted
paroles this year.

36
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:22,258
You'll celebrate New Year's Eve
at home tonight.

37
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,927
I tell you I didn't break out!

38
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:27,930
We got special
New Year paroles!

39
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:29,974
It's not a joke!

40
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,561
I'll explain when I see you.
I'll be right there.

41
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,278
You're not calling?

42
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,782
Tell the old man
the cab's here.

43
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,578
Wait for me!

44
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,224
Happy New Year.

45
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,107
- Happy New year.
- Same to you, kid.

46
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,304
Take the first right.

47
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:53,432
- It's not the right way.
- I'm in no hurry.

48
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,611
First left.

49
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:08,114
It's still not the right way.

50
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,207
Left again.

51
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,960
Hope you're having fun.

52
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,262
Now, to Faubourg St Honore.

53
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,147
Happy New Year.

54
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,875
Hello, Henri?

55
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,655
Françoise?

56
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:17,451
Are you here?

57
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,218
How could I answer?
I just got here!

58
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,637
I thought you were home.
The lights are on.

59
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,144
Want me to help you close up?

60
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,229
Very well, my dear!

61
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:49,441
Hurry home. I've got
some ideas for tonight.

69
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:57,027

00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,623
Happy New Year,
everyone!

79
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:03,946
Push the button to talk.

80
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,197
Screwball!

81
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,540
Excuse me,
I forgot my wallet.

82
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:06,675
- What color is it?
- Black.

83
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:17,102
- Sure you had it?
- I had my train ticket in it.

84
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:38,749
Marseilles.
Seven minute stopover.

85
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,183
- Mileage?
- 25,000 miles.

86
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,980
Here's your $7,000.

87
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,611
It's not cheap, for two weeks.

88
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,404
Try Avis next time.

89
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,990
Nice to have known you.

90
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,083
Registration's there.

91
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,056
Super.

92
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,183
Super classy here!

93
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,524
You screwball...
lifting that guy's wallet!

94
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,194
You in a bad mood?

95
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,074
- The car?
- Safely hidden.

96
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,411
Can't say that of myself,
working with you.

97
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:44,833
What am I doing with
a character like you,

98
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,752
...a real caricature!?

99
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,546
Some day I'll figure it out.

100
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,928
Did you break anything?

101
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,389
We were lucky.

102
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:04,144
Everyone is trailed
by a dumb shadow.

103
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:08,440
But a shadow is
your own reflection.

104
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:15,113
Why am I stuck with you?
Who did we murder?

105
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,199
Hardly anybody.

106
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:38,387
Three clerks,
the manager and a doorman.

107
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,307
Bulletproof windows
and cast-iron shutters.

108
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,601
An ultra-modern safe,

109
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,187
...burglar alarms
everywhere,

110
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,773
...all connected
to police headquarters!

111
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,733
It's crazy.

112
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,739
Know what's tragic about you,
Charlot?

113
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,075
You're stupid
and you're leery!

114
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,868
Being stupid is enough.

115
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,663
The jewelry store
is uncrackable.

116
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,332
Uncrackable.

117
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,002
Uncrackable.

118
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:20,262
I'm too old for safe-cracking,
young man.

119
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,015
Your moustache.

120
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:27,269
- It's loose.
- Where? Don't touch it!

121
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,534
That's one's pretty, too.

122
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:45,203
- Would you like a chair?
- No, thanks.

123
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:49,040
At my age, I'm afraid
I wouldn't get up again.

124
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,544
Very pretty.

125
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:55,714
- How much is that one?
- $10,980.

126
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,133
$11,000.

127
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,974
May I help you?

128
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:09,519
You see, Jeweler,
what bothers me...

129
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:13,356
...is that I prefer
the less expensive one.

130
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,069
The value of a piece
of jewelry...

131
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:22,532
...depends on the moral price
one attaches to it!

132
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,744
That one is pretty, too.

133
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,747
I hesitate...

134
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,750
It's no good to hesitate, is it?

135
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:35,086
Hesitate, my dear sir,
do hesitate!

136
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:40,342
Your hesitation honors
our selection.

137
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:43,887
- Take your time.
- I don't know...

138
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:47,599
The rubies... the pearls...
the diamonds.

139
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:52,020
- If it's not indiscreet...
- For my sister.

140
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,898
She's in a hospital in Nice.

141
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,276
Her condition is getting worse.

142
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,904
She's 68 years old.

143
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,366
68? Then I don't know...

144
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:07,285
You said that one
costs $11,000.

145
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,579
$10,980.

146
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:15,961
That's very annoying!
Why not $10,999 then?

147
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,296
Jewelers should deal
in round numbers!

148
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,050
I say it's absurd!

149
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:25,846
All right, I'll take
that one after all.

150
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,349
Give me a chair.

151
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,977
- A chair! Please excuse us.
- You take checks?

152
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:36,188
- Yes, of course.
- Wrap it in a pretty package,

153
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,316
...very pretty.

154
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,444
Be careful not to tear it.

155
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,384
Take it easy!

156
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:16,813
Unspeakable...
absolutely unspeakable.

157
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:18,648
Rotten...

158
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:22,652
...no, gamy!
That's the word.

159
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,905
That proves he loves money.

160
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:31,411
And that means he's vulnerable.

161
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,957
He's not the only one.

162
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,555
How do you know
he loves money?

163
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,935
By the way
he said goodbye.

164
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,479
You're very kind.

165
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,983
- Do you want a cab?
- No thanks,

166
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:06,488
...a little walk along the Croisette
will do me good.

167
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,575
Where can I find a newsstand?

168
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:14,329
Straight ahead, about 100 yards.

169
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,541
My respects to your sister!

170
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,877
I wish her a speedy recovery.

171
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,921
You don't want a cab?

172
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:25,840
Uncrackable!

173
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:29,803
The store, but not
the store manager!

174
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,555
- It's only the two of us.
- The three of us,

175
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,933
...counting the manager.

176
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,436
Uncrackable!

177
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:45,026
The world consists
of customers and merchants.

178
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,570
And customers should start
screwing the merchants!

179
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,699
That says it all.

180
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:55,203
- But we're not customers!
- Only you and I know that.

181
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,163
Uncrackable...

182
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:06,297
A jerk like you
in on the first psychological heist.

183
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:08,633
When the cops bust us,

184
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:11,136
...psych our way out of it, okay?

185
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,771
8:45...

186
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:26,151
...the store manager arrives.

187
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:31,448
Write down that he goes
in the back way.

188
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:42,500
8:50... main shutter is raised.

189
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:05,106
8:55... salesgirls arrive.

190
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:08,485
Three of them!

191
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,236
Pretty?

192
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,738
Pretty.

193
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:15,909
9:00...

194
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:18,244
...manager lowers
main shutter again.

195
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:21,456
Employees all inside...

196
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:25,543
...able to stock display windows,
undisturbed.

197
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,776
9:23...

198
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:52,737
...jewelry in windows...

199
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:56,241
...daytime security functioning...

200
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,910
...store ready for business.

201
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,427
9:35... doorman arrives.

202
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:21,266
Underline that for me.

203
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,060
I underline that.

204
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:56,926
9:36... that's very nice!

205
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,729
We are knocking over
Van Cleef & Arpel's?

206
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:11,608
- Sure, why?
- You're pulling to the left.

207
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,735
What about the parallax?

208
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,114
Let's see the parallax.

209
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,165
You've got a blonde parallax.

210
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:28,458
Brunette!

211
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:29,918
Blonde!

212
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:33,796
Just like I said...

213
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,300
...you're stupid, leery
and color-blind!

214
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:42,805
Maybe she dyes her hair.
Do you think antiques can help us?

215
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,269
You never know.

216
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,608
Let's see.

217
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,526
No, look that way!

218
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:59,364
Is that all you could find?

219
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,324
It's not so bad.

220
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,453
Say something...

221
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,081
...I mean, disguise your voice.

222
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:10,166
Don't I look more intelligent?

223
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,878
Try disguising your voice.
Disguise your voice!

224
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:18,091
- Don't I look more intelligent?
- I said, disguise your voice!

225
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,093
I did.

226
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:24,305
Try talking without
moving your lower jaw,

227
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,975
...as if you were paralyzed, see?

228
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:30,436
Say hello.

229
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,191
Count.

230
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,236
You're speaking normally!

231
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:43,241
- Speak normally.
- I think so.

232
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,076
Me too.

233
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,370
Want to know something?

234
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,831
It'd be best if I didn't talk.

235
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,499
You're right!

236
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:54,168
I think it's that one.

237
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:57,964
Yes, I'm sure it was the rubies.

238
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:01,301
Please excuse my master,
his sister's so hesitant.

239
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:04,929
- So he told me.
- Here is the other clip.

240
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:08,975
- A pretty package, please.
- It's $700 more.

241
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:11,853
My master remembered.

242
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,735
My master likes pretty packages.

243
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,738
Today's special is excellent.
I'll be right back.

244
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,911
Say, how much do you want...

245
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:30,955
...for that 18th century miniature?

246
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,583
You can't buy anything more...

247
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:36,085
...till you sell me
your Louis XVI table!

248
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:38,880
My little Louis XVI table...

249
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:40,965
Give me a price!

250
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:44,344
A priceless family heirloom
can't be sold.

251
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:47,221
You say that... to me?

252
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:56,230
Goodbye.
Enjoy the movie.

253
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:58,483
Now, have you decided?

254
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:03,321
Not yet. Could I speak
to the owner, please?

255
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,158
That's me.

256
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,118
I wanted to ask about your table.

257
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,412
Our "table"?
The best in Cannes!

258
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:15,583
I'm sure it is,
but I meant that one over there.

259
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,752
- It's contagious!
- How much?

260
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,963
It's not for sale.
It's my father's.

261
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,591
- Where is he?
- In the cemetery.

262
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:28,513
- Now, have you decided?
- Stuffed mussels.

263
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:31,182
Coming right up.

264
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:35,061
I'd still like to talk
about that table.

265
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:40,233
There's nothing
more to be said.

266
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,318
I don't want to sell it.

267
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:46,322
It's too expensive,
you couldn't buy it!

268
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,449
How about a drink?

269
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:05,466
I'd like to sell this.

270
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,349
That's Madame Felix's table!

271
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,351
Do you know her?

272
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,687
Yes, I know her.

273
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,649
Why are you laughing?

274
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,526
Nicole.

275
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,779
Come see
Madame Felix's table.

276
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,992
Recognize it?

277
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:36,956
I feel as if I've brought in
a monster, or a pyramid!

278
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,542
How did you know
I loved this table?

279
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:43,838
I didn't know, but that's fine,
since I want to sell it.

280
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,927
So she sold it... to you.

281
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,974
She refused to sell it yesterday.

282
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:58,311
That was yesterday.
This is today.

283
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,855
Let's say I paid the price.

284
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,778
Now you want to sell it to me
for a higher price.

285
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,241
That doesn't interest me.
Let me explain.

286
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:14,827
It was a present,

287
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:17,246
...a present for a lady.

288
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,332
The lady departed
this morning.

289
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:23,503
Is this a joke?

290
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:27,507
Why don't you call
and ask Madame Felix?

291
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,304
You know you have
a pretty smile?

292
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:36,098
Do tables always
make you smile like that?

293
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,434
That table... yes!

294
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:42,355
Let's not get excited!

295
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:47,485
It is beautiful, isn't it?

296
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:51,906
- If you say so.
- You have the certificate?

297
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,367
Who cares!
This table is signed.

298
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:57,828
And what a signature.
Nicolas Cochin...

299
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:04,752
...the enemy of all the rococo
and decadent ornamentation...

300
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:09,465
...that characterized
Louis XV furniture.

301
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:15,888
- How much?
- $9,000.

302
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:23,354
- You paid $9,000 for it?
- When you give a lady a present...

303
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,692
- You give nice ones!
- Usually, yes...

304
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:30,611
- ...when I feel like it.
- That's an expensive gift.

305
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:32,655
A present is never
expensive enough.

306
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,449
- I don't think you know prices.
- I know ladies.

307
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:38,661
- I'm not interested.
- Really?

308
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,956
- Not at that price.
- And on consignment?

309
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:45,710
Is that possible?
How about it?

310
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:49,297
I could do you a favor.
I couldn't make a profit on it.

311
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,966
You're very kind.

312
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,969
I'm at the Carlton.

313
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:59,724
I'm staying for about
three weeks... for a rest.

314
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,435
The table might as well be here...

315
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:05,688
I can't guarantee that
I'll be able to sell it.

316
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,690
Nicole, would you...

317
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:10,818
I'm in room 629.

318
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:27,543
At least revolutions
increase the value...

319
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:30,171
...of the things they destroy.

320
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:37,303
Go ask Madame Felix about this.

321
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:48,606
It stays open during lunch hour.

322
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:51,108
The employees go out in turn.

323
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,987
The manager stays in,
the whole time.

324
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:57,239
Interesting, don't you think?

325
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,659
You listening?

326
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:03,245
The salesgirls go to lunch first.

327
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:07,833
When they come back,
the salesman and the doorman go.

328
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:14,632
So there are three people inside
from 12:30 to 2:30 PM.

329
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:16,676
Interesting, isn't it?

330
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,554
You listening?

331
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:23,015
You're not listening.

332
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:27,311
When the manager goes out,
it's to buy pastries.

333
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:29,855
He went four times
yesterday.

334
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:34,110
- Has he got any vices?
- Women and pastry.

335
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,153
Who told you all that?

336
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,030
The baker's wife.

337
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:43,536
Important and interesting...

338
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:48,999
...the store closes
from January until Easter.

339
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,961
We pull it off by January,

340
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,296
...or put it off till next year.

341
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,675
Great!
Don't you like the Riviera?

342
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,555
Do you like Louis XVI?

343
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,433
You mean, the guy they...

344
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:10,146
No, I mean, his style.

345
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,939
The furniture style.

346
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:15,025
Are we here for business
or pleasure?

347
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:16,902
You never know.

348
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,997
Is the manager here?

349
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,836
Is anything wrong?

350
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:39,133
No, no, my sister
adores the clip.

351
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,845
Now she'd like a bracelet...

352
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,848
...that matches the clip.

353
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,893
An old lady's passion.

354
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:51,896
- That's how it is.
- How is she?

355
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:53,022
Much worse.

356
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:57,902
It's terrible to hesitate this way.

357
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:00,905
He doesn't want a chair.

358
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:03,574
It's really a problem.

359
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,367
I can't decide.

360
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:09,872
It's the kind
of responsibility I detest!

361
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:12,958
Perhaps we can help you.

362
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:15,169
In the past, it was simple.

363
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:19,507
My sister's only passion
used to be pastries.

364
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,675
How well I understand her!

365
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:24,303
Furthermore, a chocolate eclair...

366
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:27,973
...costs less than a sapphire.

367
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:30,559
Different dividends.

368
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:35,022
You're very funny...
and a gourmand, I'm sure.

369
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,525
I knew it!

370
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:40,110
It seems to me that this one...

371
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:42,822
You think so?
Well, I'll listen to you.

372
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:45,324
I'll take that one.
How much?

373
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:48,494
$20,000.

374
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:51,539
Round numbers, this time.

375
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:56,752
But you know I think...
I believe...

376
00:38:56,836 --> 00:39:00,464
I'd like you to give me
a discount.

377
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:04,218
I'm afraid that's not
our way of doing business!

378
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,512
I must confess to you...

379
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,764
...it's not mine, either.

380
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:12,685
I did it because
everyone else does.

381
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:17,481
I'll take the one
for $20,000.

382
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:19,775
A Pretty package?

383
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:22,111
- That above all.
- That's important to you.

384
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:25,322
My sister was very pleased.

385
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:30,786
Give me have a pen.

386
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:36,542
A chair! I can't write...

387
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:40,504
A chair! How many times
must you be told?

388
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:46,427
And excuse me
for trying to haggle.

389
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:52,016
My best wishes to your sister!

390
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:14,413
How much?

391
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:17,708
An exceptional piece...
with an exceptional price.

392
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,920
Of course.
Do you have a certificate?

393
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:23,756
The table is signed.

394
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:27,343
Signatures are meant
to be forged.

395
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:31,639
I know the Louis XVI style
was copied under Napoleon III,

396
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:35,726
...but not to equal the perfection
of Nicolas Cochin.

397
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:40,356
Ah, yes...
the enemy of rococo.

398
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:44,443
- You are a connoisseur.
- You might say that.

399
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,320
How much?

400
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,238
$10,000.

401
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,035
Louis XVI is
all the rage right now.

402
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:57,039
You might even call it madness!

403
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:00,793
You did say $10,000?

404
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,671
Not including the two chairs.

405
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:07,716
I don't understand...
about the two chairs.

406
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,513
I'd like to sell them together,
same period and style.

407
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,057
I'm terribly sorry.

408
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,685
I'm only interested
in the table.

409
00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:21,355
They go so well together.

410
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:23,607
I am truly sorry!

411
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:27,569
Because you are very pretty!

412
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:29,697
I think that, at my age,
I can say that.

413
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,243
- You're very kind.
- Too bad...

414
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,245
Listen...

415
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,500
It's a sacrifice,
but you can have the table.

416
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,712
Just the table, for $10,000.

417
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:49,758
That's so nice of you
that I'll take it.

418
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,344
I'll give you a deposit,

419
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:55,097
...and send my chauffeur for it.

420
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:57,558
Won't you come inside?

421
00:41:59,143 --> 00:42:00,602
Won't you sit down?

422
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:02,938
No, I never sit down... never.

423
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:25,502
Point one, four seconds...
car starts.

424
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:27,963
Cut, but don't burn rubber.

425
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:33,010
Point two, 13 seconds...
Felix Restaurant.

426
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:38,265
Point three, 20 seconds...
Hotel Miramar.

427
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:41,727
It's a straight shot, so fly!

428
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:47,733
Point four, 25 seconds...
Hotel Martinez.

429
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:53,489
Maximum 95 MPH, to be able
to slow down going onto the dock.

430
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:57,743
Start to slow down.

431
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:01,747
Not over 25 MPH passing
the port guards.

432
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,292
Point five, 45 seconds... good.

433
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:10,047
Speed up gradually
until the port guards are out of sight.

434
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,591
At the boats, take off again.

435
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:15,219
Watch that turn.

436
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,263
Now take off to the end
of the dock,

437
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:23,143
...but don't go over 95 MPH.

438
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:26,522
Put more air in the tires.

439
00:43:27,815 --> 00:43:30,484
You're going to start to brake.

440
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,236
Brake.

441
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:39,576
Point six, 1'1''
you get to the boat.

442
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:43,122
Stow the goods
and anchors aweigh.

443
00:43:44,123 --> 00:43:47,292
Hug the rail on that turn.

444
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:55,425
Point seven, 1'32''...
out of the port.

445
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:58,512
Maximum 20 knots
to the lighthouse.

446
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:01,682
Point eight, 1'40".

447
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:04,184
From here on,
it's clear sailing.

448
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:06,687
Steer straight for San Remo,

449
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:09,189
...and wait there till I come.

450
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:13,277
1'40". I'll hold
the manager that long.

451
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,634
Police? Van Cleef
was just held up...

452
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:40,846
...by an old man and his chauffeur.
They went toward the station.

453
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,766
1'58".

454
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:49,146
1'58" for me,
plus 2'13" for the car...

455
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:52,941
Call it four minutes.
We're covered.

456
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:58,780
The important thing
is that for over two minutes,

457
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:01,783
...I've got to keep
the manager quiet.

458
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,828
I still say you should split
when I do.

459
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:07,414
Let's see if you can tell time.

460
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,333
It's 1'58".

461
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:12,419
Okay, 1'58" plus 2'13"
is 4'11".

462
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:15,589
That beats any alarm system.

463
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:17,299
Let's go home.

464
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,600
Will you answer that?

465
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:35,943
Louis XVI?

466
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:38,445
It's Marie-Antoinette.

467
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,826
This is the antique shop.

468
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:51,500
I think I have good news for you.

469
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,669
It took a lot of time and effort.

470
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:57,589
I called antique shops,
and put many ads...

471
00:45:57,673 --> 00:46:01,343
...I think I've found a customer.

472
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:05,722
$8,000 is about as high
as he'll go, though.

473
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:08,934
That's pretty good, isn't it?

474
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,690
We'll have to talk about it.

475
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:18,902
People buy anything...
Gothic, modern,

476
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:23,407
...African, Turkish, rococo...
anything at all.

477
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:27,536
No wonder it's hard
to sell Louis XVI.

478
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,997
Perhaps it's the historical person...

479
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,249
...his bad reputation.

480
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:35,585
All those styles in furniture...

481
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:38,880
Louis XIV, XV, XVI
and all the others...

482
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:42,926
...and today we haven't got
any real ones.

483
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,762
What do you mean?

484
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:48,390
You'd think there'd be
a Churchill desk,

485
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:52,477
...a Stalin table
or a Kennedy rocking chair!

486
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:57,190
- What do you do?
- Manufacturer.

487
00:46:57,274 --> 00:46:59,401
Of what?

488
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:02,487
I'm in ice... cream.

489
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:05,782
You know,
ice cream that you eat.

490
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:10,287
I was wondering why you were
taking a vacation in the winter.

491
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,999
Winter is my dead season...

492
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:16,376
...so I take vacations.

493
00:47:18,879 --> 00:47:21,006
Ice cream must be fascinating.

494
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:25,969
It has periods...
just like furniture.

495
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:30,682
There are vanilla periods...
pistachio... chocolate.

496
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:35,729
In 1961, raspberry
was all the rage.

497
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:45,614
So someone wants my table?

498
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,866
But he'll only pay $8,000.

499
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:51,495
So you told me.
So I lose $1000 on the deal?

500
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:55,290
Not quite...
if I pay for dinner.

501
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,252
In that case,
I can hardly refuse!

502
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:01,380
I'll write you a check.

503
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:08,720
No hurry...
we're not on piecework.

504
00:48:08,804 --> 00:48:11,056
Isn't this a business dinner?

505
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:14,976
Absolutely!

506
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:17,104
Write it for cash.

507
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:20,232
Furniture comes and goes!

508
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:28,698
I'd like a word with you.

509
00:48:28,782 --> 00:48:31,993
So you sold it to a stranger!

510
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:35,914
You might even say I oversold it.
Didn't I rob you?

511
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:39,626
Yes, except that
I let myself be robbed,

512
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,503
...so it's not robbery.

513
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:44,548
$9,000 is financial manipulation!

514
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:46,842
$9,000?

515
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:52,264
That was the asking price.

516
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:56,393
Watch out,
he's very charming!

517
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:59,187
He got it for $7,000.

518
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:04,693
And you dared?

519
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:09,364
So I'm the one
who loses $1,000.

520
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:13,910
Not quite...
because I'll pay for dinner.

521
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:22,752
- I don't know my own business!
- Are you mad at me?

522
00:49:22,836 --> 00:49:26,882
There you are...
two marriages, two divorces!

523
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:30,760
They both graduated
from big universities, too.

524
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:33,722
You should get the next one
fresh out of prison.

525
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:40,604
Anyway, marriage
as it exists today...

526
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:45,525
...is the most odious of lies,
the height of egotism.

527
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:48,320
- What's that from?
- Don't ask me.

528
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:51,072
Tolstoi,
"The Kreuzer Sonata."

529
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:56,119
Simple statements
and common sense.

530
00:49:56,203 --> 00:49:58,830
He reminds me of Alain.

531
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:01,291
Who's he?

532
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,755
You read a lot?

533
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:08,465
By the ton!

534
00:50:08,507 --> 00:50:13,512
But not what
you'd call "culture."

535
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:18,016
Culture is what's left
when all the rest is forgotten.

536
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:21,186
- I like that.
- It's not mine.

537
00:50:21,228 --> 00:50:23,897
Whose is it?

538
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,607
Selma Lagerloef.

539
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,109
Gesundheit!

540
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:31,321
Never heard of her.

541
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:34,324
A Swedish writer,
1909 Nobel Prize winner.

542
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:42,582
Do you live your whole life
with intellectuals?

543
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:45,210
Oh, no! Not with them.

544
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:48,463
Let's say... next to them.

545
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:53,843
Your little friends must
be very funny guys.

546
00:50:53,927 --> 00:50:56,721
Do they laugh when it hurts?

547
00:50:56,763 --> 00:51:00,684
- What do you mean?
- Well, what you just said...

548
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:03,436
But I like to hear you talk.

549
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,939
And I like to have you listen.

550
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:07,983
Good listeners are rare.

551
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:10,777
He lived vicariously.

552
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,780
He prayed with Mauriac,
protested with Clavel,

553
00:51:13,822 --> 00:51:16,283
...committed suicide with Camus.

554
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:18,410
It couldn't go on.

555
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,912
Really something else.

556
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:26,876
Who's the man in your life
these days?

557
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,047
Some other museum guide?

558
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:33,633
An Italian guide!

559
00:51:35,594 --> 00:51:37,846
The thing
about culture is that...

560
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:40,849
...you tend to meet
educated people.

561
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:46,229
But, if I understand correctly...

562
00:51:46,313 --> 00:51:49,524
...even culture doesn't
make a woman happy.

563
00:51:52,861 --> 00:51:55,572
What is a woman?

564
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:57,616
What do you mean?

565
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:01,494
What do you think a woman is?

566
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:09,461
- I think a woman is...
- What?

567
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:14,799
A man who cries sometimes!

568
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:17,344
Very good! Whose is it?

569
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:20,555
It's mine. 1966.

570
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:24,893
So you've really only
been divorced twice.

571
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:27,896
Number one wasn't jealous,
but number two knew only that...

572
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:31,691
...two extremes... two defeats.

573
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:36,529
Now I'm independent,
I'm a liberated woman.

574
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:40,909
Where does
your Italian guide fit in?

575
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,244
Museums aren't always open!

576
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,169
I know I'm being
indiscreet, but...

577
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:55,465
...what about the lady
you got the table for?

578
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:57,467
What lady?

579
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:00,970
No memory...

580
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:03,682
...a liar...

581
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:06,810
...and married?

582
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,899
If you love a woman,

583
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:16,611
...why insult her by proposing?

584
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:18,780
I like that!

585
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,949
Marriage is only a contract.

586
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:24,661
Contracts are for people
who are afraid.

587
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:26,663
Afraid of what?

588
00:53:26,705 --> 00:53:28,873
Just afraid, that's all.

589
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:32,836
Can you elaborate
on "marriage-as-fear"?

590
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:39,217
Of course I can.

591
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:41,261
You might say it's...

592
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:45,265
...the fear of solitude
and of freedom.

593
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:48,852
Because real freedom
always leads to solitude.

594
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:50,937
That's marriage!

595
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:53,773
What else?

596
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:58,987
It's the fear of facing
two fried eggs alone some night,

597
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:02,282
...with no TV and
no life insurance.

598
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:08,705
It's the fear of finding
yourself alone...

599
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:13,501
...without someone who is
even more scared than you are.

600
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:15,795
It's a prison!

601
00:54:15,879 --> 00:54:19,257
It's worse.
In prison, you've got pals.

602
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:25,930
Anyway, you look like anything
but a married woman.

603
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:28,475
How should I take that?

604
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:31,853
How you should take that?

605
00:54:33,605 --> 00:54:37,817
As an invitation
for Christmas Eve dinner tomorrow.

606
00:54:37,901 --> 00:54:42,071
Italy comes to France
tomorrow night.

607
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:46,826
Our dinner guests
wouldn't amuse you.

608
00:54:46,868 --> 00:54:48,870
Intellectuals?

609
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,299
Why not move Christmas Eve
ahead 24 hours?

610
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:07,013
The Carlton has plenty
of champagne...

611
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:09,557
...and comfortable suites.

612
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:16,648
Too bad!

613
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:20,276
Something tells me I goofed!

614
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,529
Which was it,

615
00:55:22,612 --> 00:55:24,823
...the champagne or the suites?

616
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:27,283
It was the word
"comfortable."

617
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:30,537
A Freudian slip.

618
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:38,211
Have a good night.

619
00:55:38,253 --> 00:55:40,380
Too bad.

620
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:44,467
- Take you home?
- My car's right there.

621
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:56,855
Stupid bastard!

622
00:55:56,938 --> 00:56:00,191
"Comfortable"!
Where did I dig that up from?

623
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:22,213
Don't worry about
waking somebody up.

624
00:56:23,256 --> 00:56:26,759
Louis XVI stock still going up?

625
00:56:26,843 --> 00:56:30,638
I goofed on the champagne
and the comfort.

626
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:33,266
Whatever that means.
Did you score or not?

627
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:36,436
You're so tactful.

628
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:39,522
Did you ask about her salesgirl?

629
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:42,108
That's all we talked about.

630
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:51,075
Try making it with Swedish quotes.

631
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:54,287
You didn't score.

632
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:06,591
It's nice, a woman who talks...

633
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:08,927
...and talks well.

634
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:13,806
Still interested in Van Cleef?

635
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:16,809
I've got important things
to tell you.

636
00:57:16,893 --> 00:57:19,103
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

637
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:21,522
Oh, sure!

638
00:57:29,656 --> 00:57:32,659
How about a boat ride
tomorrow?

639
00:57:32,742 --> 00:57:34,786
What a question!

640
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,132
- Did you go out?
- Yeah, why?

641
00:57:48,216 --> 00:57:50,176
You smell of cologne.

642
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:57,225
Hello... it's me again.

643
00:57:59,102 --> 00:58:02,188
No, I called to apologize.

644
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:08,987
For the champagne...
and the comfort.

645
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:18,329
I've rented a boat
for tomorrow afternoon.

646
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:22,542
I'd really like
to talk to you some more.

647
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:25,461
The salesgirl!

648
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:28,715
And if your salesgirl
could come along,

649
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:31,551
...my secretary'd be overjoyed.

650
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:02,081
Secretary!

651
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:06,294
Should I have said,
my gunslinger?

652
00:59:16,012 --> 00:59:18,306
I goofed three times.

653
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:22,977
The champagne,
the comfort and the boat.

654
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:27,982
For a guy who's supposed
to pull off a psychological heist...

655
00:59:28,024 --> 00:59:29,650
...that's not too good.

656
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:37,408
I've come for the little table.

657
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:39,952
Here's the check.

658
00:59:42,163 --> 00:59:44,874
Thank you.
Shall I wrap it for you?

659
00:59:47,043 --> 00:59:50,338
Be careful! It's fragile.

660
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:52,548
See you later.

661
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:57,678
Midnight, right?

662
00:59:57,762 --> 00:59:59,806
It's not dressy?

663
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:07,855
Shall I serve right away?

664
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:10,316
- We'll serve ourselves.
- Merry Christmas.

665
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:12,527
Same to you.

666
01:00:20,952 --> 01:00:24,372
We'll have color TV soon.

667
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:29,043
Merry Christmas!

668
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:38,010
Here, screwball.

669
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:42,348
Want to get two whores
for tonight?

670
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:44,934
Come on. Not tonight.

671
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:48,229
Midnight Mass if you want,
but no whores.

672
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:52,275
You're right.
They'll all be in church anyway.

673
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:59,782
After Van Cleef... the drugstore?

674
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:01,742
- Know what it is?
- A watch?

675
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:05,454
It's a grenade!
Here, I'll show you.

676
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:09,584
You set it there,
and you turn that.

677
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:11,169
Set if for any time.

678
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:13,963
Push down and
you've got 30 seconds.

679
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:16,174
Blasts three square yards.

680
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:19,927
- Terrific! Where'd you get it?
- It's Japanese.

681
01:01:21,304 --> 01:01:23,264
What is this?

682
01:01:31,898 --> 01:01:34,025
Authentic Louis XVI.

683
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:37,945
It's beautiful!
Come here.

684
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:40,531
You blew a fortune on that.

685
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:43,951
Merry Christmas.

686
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:48,664
What if it explodes?

687
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:51,250
Just don't push the button.

688
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:55,046
Japanese know-how.

689
01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:59,759
Haven't been to midnight Mass
since 1954, in jail.

690
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:04,513
On this Christmas Eve of 1966,
peace has returned.

691
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:07,642
For the next 24 hours,
as if by magic,

692
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:12,021
...violence will be forgotten
in the world.

693
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:14,815
It will be forgotten
everywhere,

694
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:17,568
...except in this little
church in Cannes...

695
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:20,613
I'm afraid I don't see
what you mean.

696
01:02:20,655 --> 01:02:22,573
That's interesting!

697
01:02:22,657 --> 01:02:24,617
With your right eye on Marx,

698
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,661
...and your left on the Bible,

699
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:30,665
...you've become
ideologically cross-eyed!

700
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:36,671
I know you only meant
to analyze...

701
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:40,675
...the kind of religion
we witnessed tonight.

702
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:43,511
But it's simply
man's alienation...

703
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:46,806
...forged by bourgeois
reactionaries.

704
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:54,689
But what is more reactionary
than the Ten Commandments?

705
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,817
The Constitution of 1789!

706
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,447
You haven't said anything.

707
01:03:03,531 --> 01:03:07,702
I don't go to church much.

708
01:03:07,785 --> 01:03:09,829
And you, sir?

709
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:15,876
I'm wondering why the hell
you went to church.

710
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,046
- Don't get angry.
- I'm not getting angry.

711
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:21,716
Mass is both a rite
and a spectacle,

712
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:24,552
- ...isn't it, Claude?
- Absolutely!

713
01:03:24,635 --> 01:03:27,263
Reality is never one-sided.

714
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:31,851
What is black one day
may be white the next.

715
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:37,690
Weekday atheists
can be Sunday believers.

716
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:40,568
Take Pasteur,
who accepted miracles,

717
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:43,154
...but not spontaneous
generation.

718
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:49,452
My world is much simpler.

719
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:52,079
On one side,
there's people I like...

720
01:03:53,122 --> 01:03:56,584
...on the other, those I don't.

721
01:04:00,671 --> 01:04:03,507
Perhaps you prefer
the accordion.

722
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:18,689
May I reply to that?

723
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:25,029
Don't be offended,

724
01:04:25,071 --> 01:04:27,323
...but how did you ever
meet Françoise?

725
01:04:27,365 --> 01:04:30,701
Would you mind changing
the subject?

726
01:04:34,205 --> 01:04:38,542
Have you seen
"Prima della Revoluzione"?

727
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:42,630
Bertolucci directed it.

728
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:44,965
And Bellochio's
"Pugni in Tasca"?

729
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:52,848
Surely you've seen
"A Man and a Woman"?

730
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:55,184
Everyone is raving about it.

731
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:58,687
If you like windshield-wipers
and tranquilizers!

732
01:04:59,814 --> 01:05:02,441
- Do you read critics?
- No.

733
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:08,239
Then how do you
choose a movie?

734
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:13,577
The way I choose a woman...

735
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:16,747
...by taking risks!

736
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:21,794
Thank you and
Merry Christmas.

737
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:40,980
Now I'm kicking you all out.

738
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,942
Go on... quick!

739
01:05:46,902 --> 01:05:48,696
Françoise!

740
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:52,491
We know they have
no sense of humor...

741
01:05:52,575 --> 01:05:55,661
...but not you...
Not us.

742
01:05:55,703 --> 01:06:00,040
Be nice and go!
I've seen enough of you.

743
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:10,468
Well, good night.

744
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:16,098
Merry Christmas!

745
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,146
You were unfair.

746
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:26,192
And you were indulgent?

747
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:27,943
You were worse
than everyone else!

748
01:06:28,027 --> 01:06:29,904
Calm down.

749
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:32,740
Christmas Eve
in the courtroom.

750
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,868
I happen to like accused men.

751
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:39,038
Now you get out, too.
Go back to Italy.

752
01:06:39,121 --> 01:06:43,959
- You're crazy.
- All right, I'm crazy.

753
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:47,338
I want to make love
to an illiterate, a savage...

754
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:49,340
...a mute, a Martian...

755
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:50,466
...a man.

756
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:53,844
You don't like my way
of making love?

757
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:58,182
You mean,
your sophomoric pillow talk.

758
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,659
Should've gotten the whores!

759
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:28,837
- What's that?
- What do you think?

760
01:07:28,921 --> 01:07:32,049
I wish I had spent
the evening with you,

761
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,552
...and only you.

762
01:07:34,635 --> 01:07:36,345
I wanted you to know that.

763
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:54,446
I'm glad you called me.

764
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:58,367
I'm glad you came over.

765
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:07,001
You're not an ice cream
manufacturer!

766
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:14,717
Is it fun to live like a guy?

767
01:08:20,556 --> 01:08:24,935
You're not the type
who vacations in Cannes.

768
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:31,317
I asked if it's fun
to live like a guy.

769
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:37,364
When there are no men
in sight, it helps.

770
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:47,833
It's a bitch.

771
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:49,460
What?

772
01:08:52,004 --> 01:08:57,635
I have to go back to Paris today
and I think it's really a bitch.

773
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:18,989
I got the picture.

774
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:23,911
Don't worry,
the scar won't show.

775
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:29,291
How old are you?

776
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:34,380
Not as old as you.

777
01:09:40,636 --> 01:09:43,430
I've never seen
anyone like you.

778
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:45,766
Meaning?

779
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:48,811
You're a fast worker.

780
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:51,397
Why do you say that?

781
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,400
The way you say
you kicked them all out last night.

782
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:56,694
That's moving fast.

783
01:09:58,821 --> 01:10:02,282
Women are
more honest than men.

784
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:10,165
We don't know how to pretend,
so we work fast.

785
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:16,422
When you break up...

786
01:10:17,965 --> 01:10:20,259
...don't you give
any advance warning?

787
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:23,011
Oh, yes!

788
01:10:29,184 --> 01:10:31,854
But no one ever believes it.

789
01:10:48,746 --> 01:10:50,706
It's good to be adults.

790
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:53,584
Affairs don't need
to be justified.

791
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:57,463
They start with a look
and end with breakfast.

792
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:02,176
And so life is like a movie.

793
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:05,262
Another story ends
on a railway platform.

794
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:07,306
Who says it's ended?

795
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:11,769
David Lean, Minelli...

796
01:11:11,852 --> 01:11:13,353
...Chaplin.

797
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:16,356
I promise to go
to the movies now.

798
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:21,153
- Open this after I leave.
- What is it?

799
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:23,906
It belonged to my sister.

800
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:26,283
Your sister?

801
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:29,119
She's departed now.

802
01:11:29,203 --> 01:11:32,915
- Like the lady!
- That's right.

803
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:35,459
I want to kiss you.

804
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:47,554
I opened it.
I had to thank you!

805
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:31,056
What if we blow it?

806
01:12:32,933 --> 01:12:35,519
I said, what if we blow it?

807
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:38,438
It'll be your fault.

808
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,317
Someday tell me
what psychology is, okay?

809
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:48,323
It's the art of screwing others
before they screw you.

810
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:51,243
Is that all?

811
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:54,580
No.
But it's enough for today.

812
01:13:16,143 --> 01:13:18,562
Your customer.

813
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:21,982
At the window.

814
01:13:29,907 --> 01:13:31,742
How are you?

815
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:35,704
Not very well.
My sister is much worse.

816
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:39,333
The doctors are very worried.

817
01:13:39,374 --> 01:13:44,087
In fact, that's why
I'm here today.

818
01:13:44,171 --> 01:13:48,926
I'd like to give her
one last present.

819
01:13:50,135 --> 01:13:52,429
I understand.

820
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:56,725
I want something very special.

821
01:13:56,808 --> 01:14:00,771
- But I don't know what.
- You hesitate?

822
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:03,857
Come in...
take your time choosing.

823
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:07,653
You understand,
something special.

824
01:14:07,736 --> 01:14:09,196
A last present, after all...

825
01:14:10,656 --> 01:14:14,326
Again my choice
is not the most expensive one.

826
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:17,079
It costs $70,000!

827
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,832
I regret hesitating
like this again.

828
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:22,793
Please excuse me.

829
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:25,504
At that price, it's natural.

830
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:30,425
You don't happen
to have pictures of these?

831
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:36,807
Too bad, because then I could
have shown them to my sister.

832
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:39,351
She could have
chosen for herself.

833
01:14:39,393 --> 01:14:40,936
Furthermore,

834
01:14:41,019 --> 01:14:43,647
...she would have had
the pleasure...

835
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:46,984
...of participating, you see?

836
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:53,657
Would you permit me
to take pictures?

837
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:56,284
Is that possible?

838
01:14:56,368 --> 01:15:00,497
It's most unusual.
But, yes, for your sister.

839
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:03,500
Thank you so much,
you're very kind.

840
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:13,844
Everything's fine...
you're really very kind.

841
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:18,390
I'll drive to Nice right away
and show them to her.

842
01:15:18,473 --> 01:15:22,144
I'll be back later
to get the one she chooses.

843
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:25,564
Please, no later than 7:30.

844
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:27,566
For security reasons,

845
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:31,361
- ...we must close precisely at 7:30.
- I'll be on time.

846
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:36,199
Time to close!

847
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,023
It's cold!

848
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,158
You can get the trays.

849
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,828
I always come by bicycle.

850
01:16:21,912 --> 01:16:25,457
It's the only way to beat traffic.

851
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:28,835
Good for the thighs, too.

852
01:16:31,797 --> 01:16:33,799
You two going to dinner?

853
01:16:33,882 --> 01:16:37,094
I'm expecting a phone call.

854
01:16:37,177 --> 01:16:39,888
I'll let you know later.

855
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:58,907
Try to be on time tomorrow.

856
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:46,580
Van Cleef & Arpel's.
Set the alarm system, please.

857
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,839
Thank God we're on time!

858
01:18:37,923 --> 01:18:41,551
I thought we'd be stuck
in traffic forever.

859
01:18:41,593 --> 01:18:45,263
There! She chose
the most expensive one.

860
01:18:45,347 --> 01:18:48,600
I'm so sorry,
everything's in the safe.

861
01:18:48,642 --> 01:18:50,602
The night alarm is on.

862
01:18:50,644 --> 01:18:53,521
- I said 7:30.
- I understand,

863
01:18:53,605 --> 01:18:58,777
...but this is
so important to me.

864
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:01,571
I'm going to tell you
something.

865
01:19:01,655 --> 01:19:06,576
The doctors think
that this is her last night.

866
01:19:06,618 --> 01:19:11,164
It's horrible!
I beg of you.

867
01:19:11,248 --> 01:19:14,167
Do this for me.

868
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:27,138
Please wait here for me
in your car.

869
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:31,142
No one is allowed inside
while the safe is open.

870
01:19:31,184 --> 01:19:33,478
Give me five minutes.

871
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,648
- Which one is it?
- Yes, that one.

872
01:20:17,105 --> 01:20:19,107
Van Cleef & Arpel's here.

873
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:21,985
I have to get something
out of the safe.

874
01:20:22,068 --> 01:20:25,905
Could you unlock the vault?

875
01:20:25,947 --> 01:20:29,659
Of course!
The sea is calm and all's well.

876
01:20:29,743 --> 01:20:33,079
The sea is calm and
all's well tonight?

877
01:20:35,373 --> 01:20:38,668
- What's the date?
- The 25th.

878
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:42,797
That's right.

879
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:34,557
You can reconnect the alarm.

880
01:21:34,599 --> 01:21:38,103
The sea is still calm
and all's well.

881
01:22:15,682 --> 01:22:17,809
You're very kind.

882
01:22:17,851 --> 01:22:20,770
Please excuse
all these precautions.

883
01:22:20,854 --> 01:22:24,190
After closing time,
it's very complicated.

884
01:22:24,274 --> 01:22:26,276
It is I who must apologize.

885
01:22:26,317 --> 01:22:30,363
- This is the one?
- Yes. How much?

886
01:22:30,447 --> 01:22:33,533
$110,000.

887
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:36,619
Let me have a pen, please.

888
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:41,124
How idiotic!
It never occurred to me.

889
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:45,420
I can't accept a check now!
I should have told you.

890
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:50,008
But you had no problem
with my other checks?

891
01:22:50,091 --> 01:22:52,677
That's not the point.

892
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,721
Over $10,000,
I must call the bank.

893
01:22:54,762 --> 01:22:57,557
After 7:30, I can't!

894
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,059
What if I pay you in cash?

895
01:23:00,143 --> 01:23:02,103
- No problem!
- Fine.

896
01:23:02,187 --> 01:23:04,189
Would you get my chauffeur?

897
01:23:04,272 --> 01:23:06,774
Tell him I want my briefcase.

898
01:23:06,858 --> 01:23:10,570
I'm so sorry!
The security system's on,

899
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:14,407
...but I can't leave you alone
in the store.

900
01:23:15,992 --> 01:23:18,453
The orders come from Paris.
I'm only the manager.

901
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:22,540
It's still absurd
when you know the person!

902
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,257
We must hurry now.

903
01:23:31,341 --> 01:23:34,302
I'm afraid I won't be in time.

904
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:36,304
It's beautiful!

905
01:23:36,387 --> 01:23:40,475
I know it will make her
very happy.

906
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:43,353
Put that right there, Richard.

907
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:48,024
You may go now, thank you.

908
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:50,527
Hold that for me, please.

909
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:53,446
There you are.
Let's count it...

910
01:23:58,326 --> 01:24:01,162
- Please verify the amount.
- I'm sure it's not necessary!

911
01:24:01,204 --> 01:24:03,456
You'll want a pretty package?

912
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:06,209
No, just put it in there.

913
01:24:08,336 --> 01:24:11,464
I'm sure she'll be very happy.

914
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:17,303
Now I really must hurry!

915
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:24,394
- She'll like it!
- Especially since she picked it herself.

916
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:27,772
And excuse me again.
I'm only the manager.

917
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,361
My best wishes to your sister
for a speedy recovery.

918
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:11,065
Hello.
Yes, it's me again!

919
01:25:11,107 --> 01:25:15,069
I now have a large sum of cash
to put in the safe.

920
01:25:15,153 --> 01:25:18,239
Please unlock the vault.

921
01:25:18,323 --> 01:25:21,743
The sea is still calm
and all's well.

922
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:47,018
Don't touch a thing.

923
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:49,771
This is a robbery.

924
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:52,940
Catch the bag.

925
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:58,446
Put everything in it.

926
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:04,869
Get to work!

927
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:28,017
Our money, too.

928
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:42,448
Hurry up!

929
01:26:45,118 --> 01:26:47,203
On the floor.

930
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:48,996
The key.

931
01:27:07,807 --> 01:27:10,351
Point one, all's well.

932
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:14,689
Point two, all's well...

933
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:42,258
Point four, all's well.

934
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,928
Point five, all's well.

935
01:27:48,431 --> 01:27:50,975
Point six, all's well.

936
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:04,238
Point seven, all's well.

937
01:28:09,202 --> 01:28:12,622
Point eight, all's very well.

938
01:28:31,516 --> 01:28:34,519
What's wrong with the door?

939
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:36,938
Why is the door stuck?

940
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:41,859
You're going to tell me why.

941
01:28:42,944 --> 01:28:45,404
Why?!

942
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,084
It's for you.

943
01:29:04,382 --> 01:29:07,593
We know you're trying
to rob Van Cleef's.

944
01:29:07,677 --> 01:29:09,846
We'll be there in 30 seconds.

945
01:29:09,929 --> 01:29:11,389
You can't get away!

946
01:29:11,472 --> 01:29:13,933
The bastard!

947
01:29:14,016 --> 01:29:16,310
It's not what you think.

948
01:29:16,394 --> 01:29:18,855
When the doors
of the safe and the vault...

949
01:29:18,938 --> 01:29:22,650
...both stay open more
than two minutes,

950
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:25,194
...all the doors lock...

951
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:27,989
...and the police gets a signal.

952
01:29:34,245 --> 01:29:36,414
It can't be true!

953
01:29:47,383 --> 01:29:51,596
We'll give you five minutes
to come out of there.

954
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:55,808
Let me speak
to Counselor Balento.

955
01:29:59,478 --> 01:30:02,690
- What's going on?
- It's a robbery.

956
01:30:04,984 --> 01:30:07,153
We'll be moving in
in five minutes!

957
01:30:07,236 --> 01:30:10,489
I could go out
with the manager as hostage.

958
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:12,950
- It's too high a price!
- How high?

959
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:14,493
Don't take a hostage!

960
01:30:17,038 --> 01:30:19,498
It's been nice knowing you.

961
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:22,043
There's no way out!

962
01:30:40,227 --> 01:30:42,563
One minute left!

963
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:02,333
It's a bitch.

964
01:31:20,476 --> 01:31:22,687
Shall I open it?

965
01:32:23,414 --> 01:32:26,751
It's heartbreaking to see
a man get arrested.

966
01:32:27,918 --> 01:32:31,213
Accused men
are my weakness.

967
01:32:31,297 --> 01:32:33,716
I've still got a chance?

968
01:32:34,717 --> 01:32:36,594
Imagine how I felt...

969
01:32:36,677 --> 01:32:39,638
At noon I said goodbye
to a nice guy,

970
01:32:39,722 --> 01:32:42,850
...and the same night,
I saw him arrested.

971
01:32:45,061 --> 01:32:46,520
I'm glad you came.

972
01:32:48,064 --> 01:32:50,149
When did you get to Paris?

973
01:32:50,232 --> 01:32:52,068
This morning.

974
01:32:57,364 --> 01:32:59,492
May I keep coming
to see you?

975
01:33:00,701 --> 01:33:03,329
Never ask a prisoner that.

976
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:08,084
I'm sorry,
this is all new to me.

977
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:14,882
How do you become a crook?

978
01:33:14,965 --> 01:33:18,719
The same way you become
an antique dealer...

979
01:33:18,803 --> 01:33:20,971
...by necessity, or by choice.

980
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:26,560
The Louis XVI table...

981
01:33:28,062 --> 01:33:31,357
- ...what was that for?
- To say hello.

982
01:33:33,025 --> 01:33:36,195
Not to open the way
into the jewelry store?

983
01:33:38,489 --> 01:33:41,575
No, to open the way to you.

984
01:33:45,663 --> 01:33:48,874
Couldn't you return
the jewels?

985
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:54,713
Remember
when we had dinner?

986
01:33:54,755 --> 01:33:56,757
You asked me
what a woman is.

987
01:33:58,509 --> 01:34:01,720
Now I'll ask you
if you know what a man is.

988
01:34:03,389 --> 01:34:05,808
Someone who goes all the way.

989
01:34:15,401 --> 01:34:17,361
You could've been somebody!

990
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:19,155
I am somebody!

991
01:34:22,032 --> 01:34:23,742
Still dwelling in culture?

992
01:34:25,286 --> 01:34:27,746
Culture today...

993
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:33,252
...is in the streets, demonstrating,
making headlines.

994
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:47,933
For once, I can't touch
a man I love.

995
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:53,397
Don't change too much!

996
01:34:54,315 --> 01:34:57,276
Because in here,
I'll go out of style fast.

997
01:34:59,653 --> 01:35:01,864
Your hair is different.

998
01:35:01,947 --> 01:35:03,824
- Don't you like it?
- I do...

999
01:35:03,908 --> 01:35:07,036
But usually, when a woman
changes hairstyles,

1000
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,914
...she's changing men.

1001
01:35:09,997 --> 01:35:12,625
I have changed men.

1002
01:35:13,918 --> 01:35:16,003
Are you jealous?

1003
01:35:16,045 --> 01:35:18,214
I've got time in here.

1004
01:35:18,297 --> 01:35:20,925
At the trial,
I watched only you.

1005
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:25,638
If I play it cool,
I could be out in five years.

1006
01:35:26,889 --> 01:35:28,891
You never saw such panic!

1007
01:35:28,974 --> 01:35:31,810
De Gaulle may have
flown to Germany.

1008
01:35:31,894 --> 01:35:33,896
It's almost civil war!

1009
01:35:33,938 --> 01:35:36,523
In here, we couldn't care less!

1010
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,818
It's hard to believe!

1011
01:35:39,902 --> 01:35:42,238
- When did he die?
- Last night.

1012
01:35:42,279 --> 01:35:44,323
- What time?
- 7:00 PM.

1013
01:35:44,406 --> 01:35:47,910
- Was it his heart?
- They didn't say.

1014
01:35:47,993 --> 01:35:51,997
- Where'll he be buried?
- De Gaulle? Colombey!

1015
01:35:52,081 --> 01:35:55,042
You're sure to be paroled!

1016
01:35:57,544 --> 01:36:00,589
You won't recognize
your apartment.

1017
01:36:00,673 --> 01:36:04,176
- Why not?
- I've changed everything.

1018
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:05,970
I'm living there.

1019
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:09,765
They're laughing
at the police again!

1020
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:12,268
It's been awhile, right?

1021
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:14,520
Have you read today's
"Canard Enchaine"?

1022
01:36:14,603 --> 01:36:17,690
Get your weekly satire
right here!

1023
01:36:17,773 --> 01:36:21,110
"Police Dance
Last Tango in Paris!"

1024
01:36:23,237 --> 01:36:27,116
- "Is this the police?
- This number has been disconnected!"

1025
01:36:27,157 --> 01:36:31,287
"Forget Your Troubles,
Join the Police!"

1026
01:36:32,663 --> 01:36:35,416
"Politics Pollute Police!"

1027
01:36:35,499 --> 01:36:39,169
"Law and Order
Leaves Lewd Odor!"

1028
01:36:40,713 --> 01:36:43,924
And here's
the front-page headline,

1029
01:36:44,008 --> 01:36:47,428
..."Devaluation Hits French Copper!"

1030
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,306
Very funny.

1031
01:36:50,389 --> 01:36:53,851
Heads are going to roll,
but not mine!

1032
01:36:54,935 --> 01:36:58,230
You've got until the elections,
March 4th,

1033
01:36:58,314 --> 01:37:01,025
...to clean up
the Lyons bordello case...

1034
01:37:01,108 --> 01:37:04,695
...and the Leroy,
Juglin and Van Cleef cases!

1035
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:08,866
Till March 4th!

1036
01:37:12,703 --> 01:37:15,914
I've got an idea
about the Van Cleef case.

1037
01:37:15,998 --> 01:37:18,250
We've got a chance!

1038
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:22,546
Simon's lawyer has been
demanding a parole.

1039
01:37:22,629 --> 01:37:24,673
Why don't we okay it?

1040
01:37:24,757 --> 01:37:28,427
When he gets out,
he'll try to see his accomplice.

1041
01:37:28,469 --> 01:37:30,679
That means the jewels!

1042
01:37:30,763 --> 01:37:32,806
And it's the jewels
we want, right?

1043
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:37,519
Here's my decision!
December 31st falls next week.

1044
01:37:37,603 --> 01:37:40,147
Does that ring a bell?

1045
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:42,441
We'll make Simon think...

1046
01:37:42,524 --> 01:37:46,862
...he's being paroled
for the New Year.

1047
01:37:48,655 --> 01:37:53,077
And once he's out,
you stick to him like glue!

1048
01:38:09,426 --> 01:38:12,096
Simon.
You should have called.

1049
01:38:12,179 --> 01:38:15,099
I only got out three hours ago,
with a tail.

1050
01:38:15,182 --> 01:38:17,810
Don't look, they're out there.

1051
01:38:17,893 --> 01:38:19,853
Like my new face jobs?

1052
01:38:19,895 --> 01:38:23,690
Almost as much
as the ones you'd made for me.

1053
01:38:23,732 --> 01:38:27,778
Michou, I'm here because
I need a big favor.

1054
01:38:27,861 --> 01:38:31,031
But it puts you in the soup.

1055
01:38:31,115 --> 01:38:35,994
They let me out hoping to get
my pal in the Van Cleef caper.

1056
01:38:36,078 --> 01:38:38,705
With me here,
those two will think...

1057
01:38:38,747 --> 01:38:42,000
...that you're the one.

1058
01:38:42,084 --> 01:38:46,338
Keep them on that track
for two or three days.

1059
01:38:46,422 --> 01:38:49,258
Then suddenly remember
that in December 1966,

1060
01:38:49,341 --> 01:38:51,760
...you had a club in the Caribbean.

1061
01:38:51,844 --> 01:38:55,431
- Count on me.
- Thanks, Michou.

1062
01:38:55,514 --> 01:38:58,058
They're all yours.

1063
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:25,002
Here.

1064
01:39:25,085 --> 01:39:26,462
What's that?

1065
01:39:26,503 --> 01:39:29,214
It's for the New Year.

1066
01:39:29,298 --> 01:39:32,342
And for doing me a little favor.

1067
01:39:32,426 --> 01:39:34,178
Like what?

1068
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:40,517
Turn right
at the next corner...

1069
01:39:40,601 --> 01:39:43,353
...at full speed,
and finish the trip alone.

1070
01:40:22,476 --> 01:40:25,395
No, he's not in.
He's at a party.

1071
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:30,234
Is it really important?

1072
01:40:30,275 --> 01:40:33,779
The party's in Aubervilliers.

1073
01:40:33,862 --> 01:40:39,993
At Maurice's,
24 rue Jean Jaures.

1074
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:43,747
It was really important, right?

1075
01:41:41,471 --> 01:41:44,474
I want to talk to Charlot.

1076
01:41:44,558 --> 01:41:47,811
- Which Charlot?
- With the grey hair.

1077
01:41:47,894 --> 01:41:49,646
Who's calling?

1078
01:41:49,730 --> 01:41:53,191
- Louis XVI.
- Louis XVI?

1079
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:11,209
- Who is it?
- It's Louis XVI.

1080
01:42:11,293 --> 01:42:13,337
Which Louis XVI?

1081
01:42:20,385 --> 01:42:23,055
Happy New Year,
screwball.

1082
01:42:24,556 --> 01:42:27,517
- Who's this?
- It's me.

1083
01:42:27,559 --> 01:42:29,227
Who, me?

1084
01:42:29,311 --> 01:42:31,605
Me!

1085
01:42:31,688 --> 01:42:34,441
- Where are you?
- Outside.

1086
01:42:36,443 --> 01:42:39,529
- Where outside?
- Come out, I'm waiting.

1087
01:43:05,639 --> 01:43:08,600
How the hell
can you be here?

1088
01:43:08,684 --> 01:43:12,688
- They let me out.
- Really?

1089
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:15,440
- To pull you in!
- You got a tail?

1090
01:43:15,524 --> 01:43:18,902
I'm clean for a few hours.

1091
01:43:18,985 --> 01:43:21,405
Son of a bitch!

1092
01:43:26,076 --> 01:43:28,412
Six years!

1093
01:43:28,453 --> 01:43:29,996
How are you?

1094
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,249
Six years!

1095
01:43:35,293 --> 01:43:39,131
You're not going to cry!
How are you?

1096
01:43:39,214 --> 01:43:42,217
- Okay, and you?
- I'll be okay.

1097
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,345
I'm glad to see you.

1098
01:43:45,429 --> 01:43:47,889
I'm glad to see you, too.

1099
01:43:49,141 --> 01:43:51,059
Is it far?

1100
01:43:51,143 --> 01:43:53,562
It's far, but peaceful.

1101
01:43:57,149 --> 01:43:59,776
Have you seen Françoise?

1102
01:44:02,529 --> 01:44:05,198
Have you seen Françoise?

1103
01:44:06,616 --> 01:44:09,786
- Who is he?
- How should I know?

1104
01:44:09,828 --> 01:44:14,040
She wants to live like a guy,
so she lives like a guy!

1105
01:44:14,124 --> 01:44:16,168
Are you nuts, or drunk?

1106
01:44:16,251 --> 01:44:20,297
Everything's changed
in the last six years!

1107
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:22,549
I'll say it has!

1108
01:44:22,632 --> 01:44:25,135
Guys even talk
like broads now!

1109
01:44:25,218 --> 01:44:29,347
Calm down.
In a few days you'll catch on.

1110
01:44:36,938 --> 01:44:39,483
It is now official.

1111
01:44:39,566 --> 01:44:41,860
The prison break has succeeded.

1112
01:44:41,902 --> 01:44:46,698
Michel Barbier escaped from
La Sante Prison unhindered,

1113
01:44:46,782 --> 01:44:50,911
...armed only with a gun
he'd made out of bread.

1114
01:44:50,994 --> 01:44:54,414
- You in on it?
- I didn't think it'd work.

1115
01:44:55,415 --> 01:44:57,042
Hats off to the kid!

1116
01:44:59,544 --> 01:45:02,881
You, opening a safe
with a key?

1117
01:45:09,179 --> 01:45:11,139
Aren't they pretty?

1118
01:45:13,767 --> 01:45:15,769
Nothing but dollars?

1119
01:45:15,852 --> 01:45:19,105
How'd I know
the bottom'd drop out?

1120
01:45:20,649 --> 01:45:22,943
And now... Orly Airport.

1121
01:45:22,984 --> 01:45:24,945
I tell you she loves you!

1122
01:45:25,028 --> 01:45:28,198
- And I tell you... Orly!
- You don't get it!

1123
01:45:28,281 --> 01:45:30,283
Moron! A girl loves you,

1124
01:45:30,367 --> 01:45:32,786
...a pal's here to help you,

1125
01:45:32,828 --> 01:45:36,998
...you can't samba,
and you still bug out to Brazil!

1126
01:45:37,082 --> 01:45:39,626
No baggage?

1127
01:45:39,668 --> 01:45:41,586
Freedom hasn't done
much for you.

1128
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:44,422
Wake up, Grandpa, it's 1973!

1129
01:45:44,506 --> 01:45:46,508
Broads live like guys now!

1130
01:45:46,591 --> 01:45:49,636
I don't want a guy in my bed!

1131
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:52,681
Board in five minutes.

1132
01:45:52,764 --> 01:45:55,642
Right! Give me a week.

1133
01:45:55,725 --> 01:45:58,812
I'll dump everything
and join you in Rio.

1134
01:46:00,897 --> 01:46:02,983
And Françoise?

1135
01:46:03,859 --> 01:46:05,986
What do I tell her?

1136
01:46:06,027 --> 01:46:09,030
- Nothing.
- That's not nice.

1137
01:46:36,683 --> 01:46:38,894
It's me.

1138
01:46:38,977 --> 01:46:41,104
Who's me?

1139
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:49,946
Did you escape?

1140
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:52,616
No, I was paroled.

1141
01:46:57,662 --> 01:46:59,456
Listen...

1142
01:47:00,582 --> 01:47:02,459
...there's a man in my life.

1143
01:47:08,965 --> 01:47:11,843
- Where can I find a phone?
- Over there.

1144
01:47:11,927 --> 01:47:14,429
- You've got five minutes!
- I know.

1145
01:47:38,036 --> 01:47:40,121
It's me.

1146
01:47:44,751 --> 01:47:48,046
My love! Where are you?

1147
01:47:48,088 --> 01:47:51,091
At the prison door.
I just got out.

1148
01:47:51,174 --> 01:47:53,301
Did you escape?

1149
01:47:53,385 --> 01:47:56,888
No, I got a special
New Year's parole.

1150
01:47:59,641 --> 01:48:00,725
Hurry.

1151
01:49:03,204 --> 01:49:08,793
I guess I'd better have
my coffee downstairs.

1152
01:49:22,849 --> 01:49:25,393
I can't even call you a bitch.

1153
01:49:25,477 --> 01:49:29,731
A man always tells a woman...

1154
01:49:29,814 --> 01:49:34,611
that he can love her
and still live his own life.

1155
01:49:34,694 --> 01:49:37,405
Imagine it
the other way around.

1156
01:49:38,573 --> 01:49:40,700
It's difficult.

1157
01:49:41,951 --> 01:49:43,953
But I'll try.

1158
01:52:32,538 --> 01:52:34,207
You like it?

1159
01:52:35,917 --> 01:52:39,045
I fixed a real breakfast for you.

1160
01:52:39,087 --> 01:52:41,756
You'll see how the place
has changed.

1161
01:52:41,839 --> 01:52:44,217
You won't recognize anything.

1162
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:46,594
Shall I fix you a bath?

1163
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:53,893
I modernized the kitchen.

1164
01:52:55,395 --> 01:52:57,855
Make yourself at home.

1165
01:52:57,939 --> 01:53:00,441
You prefer coffee, right?

1166
01:53:05,863 --> 01:53:08,783
You're not taking off your coat?

1167
01:53:16,749 --> 01:53:19,294
It was my way of not dying.

1168
01:53:21,004 --> 01:53:25,508
It was my way of waiting...
of staying alive.

1169
01:53:33,016 --> 01:53:34,684
Happy New Year.

1170
01:54:04,005 --> 01:54:06,924
I'll have some coffee now.
