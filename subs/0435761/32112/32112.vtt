FATHER'S FAVORITE, AND...

ALL THREE OF MY BROTHERS FOUGHT IN THE WAR.
HE IS YOUR FATHER'S WHAT?

85
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:33,987
WE SHOULD GET MIRIAM ON A BOAT TONIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU SAY, BUDDY?

00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:37,672
WE TAKE UP THE DORY.
IT WILL BE FANTASTIC.

87
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:40,899
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO THAT, GUS.
WE COULD GET INTO TROUBLE.

88
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,180
COME ON, BERNIE!
IT WILL BE FUN.

89
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,680

NO, NO. WE'RE ARE NOT...
SMALL BOAT SAILS...

92
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:04,241
HOW ABOUT ONE OF THOSE BIGGER BOATS?
HIDE OUT THE DOCK?

93
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,474
IF BERNIE IS WITH ME, WE CAN DO IT.
AN OLD FISHING BOAT?

94
00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:11,608
THOSO FISHERMEN DON'T WANT US AROUND.
UNLESS WE'RE PULLIN' THEM IN.

95
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,877
THEY THINK THEY OWN THE GODDAMN WATER.
THEY ARE NOT REALLY VERY NICE.

COME ON! DON'T BE SUCH A FATHEAD, MARIAM.
YEAH!

97

LET'S GO OUT ON THE DORY.
WHAT'S THERE TO BE AFRAID OF?

98
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,838
WHAT'S UNDERNEATH, RIGHT?
HMM...UH.

109
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:13,531
AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A DORY.
AND I DON'T WANT HER TO GET SICK ON THAT NICE BIG COAT.

111
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:17,369

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,786
SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS.

164
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,151
SOMETIMES YOU GO OUT AND YOU DON'T COME BACK.

165
00:12:47,153 --> 00:12:50,511
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE STORM OR MARRIAGE, BERNIE?

166
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,296
I THINK I'M TALKING ABOUT THE STORM, RIGHT?

167
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,619
YOU ARE SCARED OF A STORM?

168
00:12:57,995 --> 00:12:59,103
NO.

169
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:05,603
I DON'T WANNA DISAPPOINT ANYBODY.

170
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:08,158
AND...

171
00:13:09,543 --> 00:13:12,114
I DO NOT WANNA LOSE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.

172
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,641
SO...

173
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,020
YEAH, LET'S GET MARRIED.

174
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:25,857

175
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:27,806
OH! YEAH.

176
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:31,958
WHEN?

177
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:35,791
WHAT? YOU WANT ME TO PICK A DATE? NO.
WHEN DO YOU WANNA GET MARRIED?

178
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:38,376
APRIL 16TH.
OK?

179
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:41,629
OK! APRIL 16TH IT IS.

180
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:46,609
BUT...BUT I GOTTA ASK PERMISSION FROM CLUFF FIRST .
YOU GOTTA ASK PERMISSION?

181
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:49,816
YEAH, IT'S...IT'S FROM MY COMMANDING OFFICER.
IT'S COAST GUARD REGULATION.

182
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:52,053
BUT PROMISE, I WILL ASK HIM TOMORROW.

183
00:13:52,153 --> 00:13:55,053
OK, BERNIE.

184
00:13:57,493 --> 00:13:59,054
LET'S GET YOU HOME.

185
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,690
MAYBE WE CAN DANCE.

186
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,576
AH! LOOK AT THAT!
IT'S ALREADY STARTED TO SNOW. HMM?

187
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:53,499
CAN YOU HEAR ME OVER THIS HUMMING, CAPTAIN?

188
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:58,505
NOW THAT FRACTURE THEY WELDED LAST MONTH,
THAT'S NOT GONNA HOLD IN THIS SEAS.

189
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:01,020
TAKES ABOUT A JOLT TO FRACTURE AGAIN.

190
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:06,428
I DON'T HAVE TO GO ON TECH, CAPTAIN.
I CAN HEAR IT RIGHT DOWN FROM HERE.

191
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,626
THAT WELD IS REALLY HUMMIN'.

192
00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:15,271
IT'S HUMMIN', SIR...THE WELD IS...HUMMIN'.
I LIKE TO TAKE IT DOWN TO THREE KNOTS, PLEASE.

193
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:23,050
IF WE DO NOT SLOW DOWN, CAPTAIN,
WE MAY NOT HAVE THE...

194
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,114
POSITION TO HOLD.

195
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:30,821
AH! NO PROBLEM, CAP.

196
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:33,436
HOLDIN' AT SEVEN KNOTS.
THANK YOU, SIR.

197
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:46,774
HEY, POP?
I HEAR IT, RIGHT.

198
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:52,175
YOU WANNA GO UP ON DECK AND LOOK AT THOSE
CRACK RUSTERS HOLDIN' UP THOSE WELDS TOGETHER?

199
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:55,068
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO GET A HAT, POPO.

200
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,752
WHAT DID HE SAY?

201
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:00,305
HE SAYS HE WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER
TAKIN' IN A HAT WITH YOU AS WELL.

202
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,081
GET SOME SLEEP.

203
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:20,058
NO! WE ROCKIN' THE BOAT!

204
00:16:20,158 --> 00:16:22,058
HEY, POPS?

205
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:25,310
WE KNOW ABOUT THIS WEATHER!
IT'S KILLING ME AND YOUNG ELDON HERE.

206
00:16:25,312 --> 00:16:28,599
TINY, SURE IT'S THE WEATHER?
MAYBE IT'S YOUR SINGIN'.

207
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:33,804
* BOY! PEOPLE SAID SIT DOWN *
* SIT DOWN, YOU ARE ROCKIN' THE BOAT *

208
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:34,806
COME ON.

209
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:38,472
* PEOPLE SAID SIT DOWN *
* SIT DOWN, YOU ARE ROCKIN' THE BOAT *

210
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:40,408
SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

211
00:16:49,982 --> 00:16:51,591
AH! IT'S GONNA GET WORSE.

212
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:08,033
JIMMY? I DIDN'T MAKE IT TOP SIDE.
THAT WELD CAN'T HOLD IN THESE SEAS.

213
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:09,838
YOU GOTTA SLOW HER DOWN.

214
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:13,282
I'M CALLIN' THE CAPTAIN BACK.

215
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:48,157
IT'S COMIN' IN.

216
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,417
OK POPS?
YEAH.

217
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,605
GO UP!

218
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:12,669
WE GOTTA HULL FRACTURE IN THE ENGINE ROOM.

219
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:18,023
ALL HANDS MUSTER YOUR MATTRESSES, BLANKETS!
WHATEVER YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON.

220
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,520
TUDOR?

221
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,027
YEAH, BOY?

222
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:33,698
I CAN'T GET ANYONE ON THE BRIDGE.

223
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,248
I NEED YOU TO GO UP TELL THE CAPTAIN THAT
THERE IS A 18 FOOT FRACTURE IN OUR HULL.

224
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:40,580
TELL HIM THESE PUMPS CAN HOLD,
BUT PUT 'EM IN PORT BEFORE THEY WRECK.

225
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:42,366
CAPTAIN DON'T UNDERSTAND ME, WILL.

226
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:46,318
I KNOW HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND YA,
HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO ANYONE, ANYWAY.

227
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:30,318
JESUS! MARY AND JOSEPH!

228
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,839
COLD OUT THERE?
YEAH.

229
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,677
STILL TRYING TO FIX THAT DAFT THING?
YEAH.

230
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:26,526
OH! COME ON, FRITZY!
IT'S USELESS.

231
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:28,719
LET THE GUY WHO FIXED IT, COME FIX IT.

232
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:30,767
I WOULD IF HE WOULD SHOW UP.

233
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:32,972
WHAT'S THIS ON THE RADIO, SHIP BREAKIN' UP?

234
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:34,779
THAT'S THE FORT MERCER.

235
00:20:35,004 --> 00:20:38,695
FORT...FORT MERCER?
SHE'S A BIG LADY, SHE'S A T2 TANKER.

236
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:42,573
IT WAS OUT ON RADIO, COUPLA HOURS AGO.
APPARENTLY SHE'S GOT A BIG CRACK IN HER HULL.

237
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,074
IT'S PILLIN' OIL ALL OVER THE PLACE.

238
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:47,952
SHE IS ABOUT 20 MILES EAST OFF OF NANTUCKET.

239
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:52,636
IT SOUNDS LIKE BOSTON AND NANTUCKET SEND OVER THEIR ENTIRE FLEET.
WE COULD BE NEXT.

240
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:57,128
THEY'RE SAYING GAIL FORCE WINDS 50 OR 60 MPH!

241
00:20:57,228 --> 00:20:59,128
YEAH?
YEAH.

242
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:02,212
IT'S GONNA BE A MESS.

243
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:12,643
OH! BERNIE, BERNIE? UMM...
MIRIAM CALLED FOR YA.

244
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,659
YEAH.
OK.

245
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,479
GOOD LUCK, PAL.

246
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,339
YEAH?
MR.CLUFF.

247
00:21:22,624 --> 00:21:25,075
IT'S ME...BERNIE, SIR.

248
00:21:26,047 --> 00:21:31,863
WEBBER, PICK YOURSELF A CREW.
GO OUT THERE, HELP THEM FISHERMEN SECURE THEIR BOAT AT THE PIER.

249
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:33,853
YEAH, SIR.

250
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:37,005
SIR, I NEED...NEED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.

251
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,425

00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:44,078
PERMISSION?
PERMISSION...FOR A GIRL?

253
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,764
MR.CLUFF, SIR IT'S WORKING NOW.

254
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:48,074
YEAH, SIR.

255
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:53,784
BUT, YOU KNOW SIR. IT IS NOT SOME GIRL, SIR.
NOT NOW, WEBBER.

256
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:56,791
WE'RE BACK UP.

257
00:21:57,068 --> 00:21:59,552
CLUSTER HERE MERCER RESCUE RIGHT?

258
00:21:59,554 --> 00:22:02,323
AND THIS HERE ANOTHER BLIP, 2 MILES FROM HERE?

259
00:22:02,325 --> 00:22:04,639
WE MUST STILL BE GETTIN' PHANTOM ECHOES!

260
00:22:04,953 --> 00:22:07,154
HOW WE SUPPOSED TO TELL, ONE OF THEM IS OUT THERE?

261
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:11,295
WHEN'S THAT TECHNICIAN COMIN' FIXIN' THIS, PATRICK?
AND WHERE'S CHIEF BANGS?

262
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:14,588
ALRIGHT! IT'S FITZGERALD, SIR.

263
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:16,649
CHIEF BANGS IS IN THE MESS HALL, SIR.

264
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,095
YOU MEANT TO FOLLOW MY ACCENT
CAUSE I'M NOT FROM AROUND HERE.

265
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:24,464
NO, MR.CLUFF.

266
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:30,396
WHY ARE STILL STANDIN', WEBBER?
SIR, BUT...

267
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:32,981
TAKE LIVESEY WITH YOU,
AND TOP THEM FISHING BOATS.

268
00:22:32,983 --> 00:22:35,392
YEAH, SIR.
YOU WANT ME TO GO WITH WEBBER, SIR?

269
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,843
TO SECURE FISHING BOATS?

270
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:43,655
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME, LIVESEY?
YEAH, YOU WITH WEBBER.

271
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:53,183
SORRY, REG! HIS ORDERS, YOU KNOW.

272
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,866
THAT'S ENOUGH TIME, WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH?

273
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:17,164
WE'RE TAKIN' UP WATER,
WE GOTTA LAUNCH SOME LIFEBOATS.

274
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,965
WHY YOU GOTTA BE SUCH A JACKASS, BROOM?

275
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:22,101
THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS PRAY
FOR THE CAPTAIN, CHIEF COLLAGEN...

276
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:24,245
REST OF THEM MEN.
ALL GOOD MEN.

277
00:23:24,247 --> 00:23:26,232
EH? WE GOOD MEN, CORY?

278
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:27,679
AH! DON'T GET ME WRONG,

279
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:29,514
PRAYIN' IS GREAT, BUT IT AINT EVERYTHING.

280
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:32,088
WE ACTUALLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

281
00:23:41,082 --> 00:23:43,308
SYBERT? A WORD.

282
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:47,550
THAT HOTHEAD BROWN, HE WANTS TO LAUNCH THE LIFEBOATS.

283
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,940
LIFEBOATS?
QUIREY, HE WANTS TO DO NOTHING.

284
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:52,460
THE BETWEEN OF THEM, THE TWO OF THEM
ARE GETTIN' WORKED UP.

285
00:23:58,492 --> 00:24:03,105
NOW, I FIGURE THAT YOU KNOW THE BOAT BETTER THAN ANYBODY.
YOU ARE PRACTICALLY MARRIED TO IT, SO...

286
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:07,186
I THINK THEY'LL LISTEN TO YA.
LISTEN TO ME?

287
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,906
HALF THOSE MEN DON'T LIKE ME.

288
00:24:10,094 --> 00:24:12,299
NOBODY ON THIS SHIP LIKES ME,
BUT YOU AND TCHUDA.

289
00:24:13,466 --> 00:24:15,953
THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE YA,
BUT THEY OUTTA LISTEN TO YA.

290
00:24:42,754 --> 00:24:45,278
WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE CAPTAIN GOT OFF AN SOS.

291
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:48,112
THE RADIO IS GONE.
WE CAN'T CALL NOBODY.

292
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:51,922
IT'S JUST...JUST GARCIA OVER HERE WITH
A SHORTWAVE TRYIN' TO PICKUP CHATTER!

293
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:54,538
I MEAN, FAR AS WE KNOW,
NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WE'RE OUT HERE.

294
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:59,595
I'M SAYIN', WE LAUNCH SOME LIFEBOATS
AND GET OFF THE SHIP WHILE WE CAN.

295
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:01,724
HOW WE GONNA GET THEM IN
THE WATER IN THIS STORM?

296
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:05,876
IT CAN'T BE DONE! THOSE BOATS ARE TOO SMALL.
IT'S SUICIDE, BRADY!

297
00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:09,788
YOU CAN NOT DO THIS, YOU CAN'T DO THAT?
YOU JUST WANNA SIT UP HERE, DO NOTHIN'?

298
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,377
THAT'S IT! NO OFFICERS, NO ORDERS.
EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.

299
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,816
THAT AIN'T THE WAY, BROWN.

300
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:17,533
NEVER DID NOTHIN' FOR NOBODY.

301
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:20,119
NOW, SHIP'S SPLIT...

302
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:22,666
BUT THE BULKHEAD'S SEPERATING THE TANKS, 8 AND 9.

303
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:25,608
AND MR.SYBERT SAYS THAT THE OTHER
TANKS ARE NOT FRACTURED, SO...

304
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:28,197
THE AIR IN THE BALLAST TANKS
SHOULD KEEP US AFLOAT.

305
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:33,041
BUT MR.SYBERT ALSO SAYS THAT...
MR.SYBERT SAYS THIS, MR.SYBERT SAYS THAT.

306
00:25:33,043 --> 00:25:35,710
HE'S A BIG BOY. LET HIM SAY IT HIMSELF.
HE IS RIGHTHERE.

307
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:38,576
GO AHEAD.

308
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:47,013
AH..AH, WE'RE SINKING.

309
00:25:49,486 --> 00:25:51,294
YEAH, BUT THE WHISTLE WORKS.

310
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,852
SO WE SHOULD KEEP BLOWIN' THAT.
MAYBE SOMEBODY WILL HEAR IT.

311
00:25:57,524 --> 00:26:00,666
I DO NOT KNOW, BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY SINKING.

312
00:26:00,668 --> 00:26:03,922
BECAUSE THE CRACK IN THE ENGINE ROOM
IS TAKIN' ON TOO MUCH WATER.

313
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,462
PUMPS CAN'T KEEP UP.

314
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:12,383
IF THE WATER REACHES THE AIR INTAKE IN THE ENGINE,
WE GONNA EH, LOSE ALL THE POWER.

315
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:15,228
IF WE LOSE ALL THE POWER, WE LOSE THE PUMPS.
WE LOSE THE PUMPS...

316
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:18,355
THEN WE GONNA DROP REALLY QUICK.

317
00:26:18,454 --> 00:26:20,813
HOW LONG WE GOT BEFORE THAT HAPPENS?

318
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:25,200
FOUR, MAYBE FIVE HOURS.

319
00:26:26,814 --> 00:26:29,062
WE NEED TO BUY OURSELVES SOME TIME.

320
00:26:29,982 --> 00:26:32,071
SO SOMEBODY CAN FIND US.

321
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:33,614
IF ANYBODY IS EVEN LOOKIN'.

322
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:37,359
EVEN IF THEY DO KNOW WE'RE HERE,
THE SEA IS BIG ENOUGH.

323
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,933
I MEAN, IT RIPPED THIS THING IN HALF.

324
00:26:40,123 --> 00:26:42,040
HOW WILL THEY HELL ARE WE GONNA GET OUT?

325
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:44,793
THAT'S WHY I'M SAYIN' WE GOTTA LAUNCH THE LIFEBOATS.

326
00:26:44,795 --> 00:26:47,879
OUR LUCKS RUNNIN' OUT.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN LUCK, BROOM.

327
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:52,453
PUT THOSE LIFEBOATS OUT THERE IN THE SEAS,
WON'T LAST 12 SECONDS.

328
00:26:52,455 --> 00:26:55,128
YOU AND QUIREY...BOTH JUST WANNA SIT AROUND DO NOTHIN.

329
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,979
YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA, SYBERT,
OR YOU JUST GONNA HIDE DOWN BELOW?

330
00:27:06,683 --> 00:27:08,386
WE'LL RUN HER GROUND.

331
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,300
WHAT? DO WHAT?

332
00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:12,550
YOU WANNA RUN HER GROUND, SYBERT?

333
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:15,284
EVEN IF IT COULD WITH HALF A SHIP, WHY WOULD YA?

334
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:18,404
THIS WILL BREAK APART AND
DUMP US ALL OUT IN THE SEA.

335
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:21,879
IT'S OUR ONLY CHOICE.
WE FIND A SOFT SHORE AND LAY HER UP.

336
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:23,554
SLOW THE WATER THAT'S COMIN' IN,

337
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:25,709
STAY IN THE SAME SPOT AND BLOW THE WHISTLE,

338
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,173
WILL GIVE US A CHANCE FOR SOMEONE
TRYING TO TO LOOK FOR US TO FIND US.

339
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:30,509
YOU GONNA STAY ON THE SHIP WITHOUT HYDRAULICS?

340
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:33,189
THAT'S YOUR PLAN?
HOW'S THAT GONNA WORK?

341
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:35,806
WE'LL BUILD A MANUAL TILLER.

342
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,850
HEY SYBERT, WHY...WHY SHOULD WE EVEN LISTEN TO YOU?

343
00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:39,812
ALL YOU EVER CARED ABOUT, WAS THIS SHIP.

344
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:42,345
TELL YOU WHAT?
YOU TWO MAKE A CUTE COUPLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.

345
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:44,445
ME? I WANNA GO IN A LIFEBOAT.

346
00:27:45,152 --> 00:27:46,171
LOOK.

347
00:27:48,456 --> 00:27:51,672
INSERT A STEEL BEAM INTO THIS STEERING QUADRANT.

348
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,726
WE PUT PULLEYS ON THE END OF IT FOR LEVERAGE.

349
00:27:57,871 --> 00:27:59,865
AND WE WILL MOVE IT MANUALLY.

350
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,978
EXCUSE ME?
EXCUSE ME?

351
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:09,565
I THINK I GOT THE RADIO WORKING.

352
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:18,644
BEARING 83 DEGREES, 27 MILES EAST OF NANTUCKET...

353
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:21,464
EAST OF NANTUCKET?
THAT AIN'T THE PENDLETON.

354
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,649
FORT MERCER...THAT'S ANOTHER T2.

355
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:27,971
ANOTHER TANKER SPLIT IN TWO, BESIDES US!

356
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:30,875
BUT IF EVERYONES GONNA HELP THEM, WHO'S GONNA...?

357
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:33,074
WHO'S GONNA COME FOR US?

358
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,519
HOW YOU FEELIN'?
EVERYTHIN' ALRIGHT?

359
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:44,274
DID YOU...DID YOU ASK CLUFF YET?
NO.

360
00:28:44,276 --> 00:28:45,491
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK 'EM?

361
00:28:45,493 --> 00:28:47,320
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
BELLA?

362
00:28:48,063 --> 00:28:51,188
WHAT?
YOU ASK HIM YET? YOU ASK CLUFF?

363
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,089
I TOLD YOU NOT TO TELL ANYBODY.

364
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:58,096
I'M SORRY! I'M NOT HAVING A VERY GOOD DAY.
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL...

365
00:28:58,098 --> 00:29:00,516
YOU KNOW, WILLEY, YOU DON'T NEED
PERMISSION TO GET MARRIED.

366
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:03,629
ACTUALLY, YOU DO CHIEF.
UNLESS YOU ARE UNDER-AGE.

367
00:29:04,468 --> 00:29:06,979
WELL...THANK YOU, CHIEF.
JUST FOLLOWING REGULATIONS.

368
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:08,862
LET'S GO GET SUITED UP.

369
00:29:08,864 --> 00:29:13,372
WELL IT'S NOT REGULATION, WEBBER.
JUST, EH...A FORMALITY, CURTOSY.

370
00:29:13,444 --> 00:29:17,151
AND, HEY! DID I HEAR RIGHT THAT SHE ASKED YOU?

371
00:29:17,153 --> 00:29:19,049
FOLLOWING ORDERS, RIGHT BUBBA?

372
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:22,361
YEAH, SHE ASKED ME, CHIEF.

373
00:29:24,677 --> 00:29:28,053
WOW! WOW! YOU SURE GOT YOUR PANTS
ON WEBBER OR SHE WEARIN' EM?

374
00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:29,858
SOUNDS LIKE THIS GIRL
CUT OFF YOU BA...

375
00:29:32,158 --> 00:29:34,378
WHAT, WEBBER? WHAT, HUH?
WOO!

376
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,593
DON'T YOU GOT BOATS TO TIE UP?

377
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:40,172
SHE'S...SHE'S MY FIANCEE, SIR.

378
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:42,680
WHO ASKED YOU...

379
00:29:44,213 --> 00:29:45,589
TO BE MARRIED?

380
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:49,020
COME ON, LIVESEY, LET'S GO.

381
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:51,100
ONE MOMENT.

382
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:52,995
SURE.

383
00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:55,290
I'M SORRY, SIR.
SAY IT.

384
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,936
THIS LINE IS BAD, MA'AM.
I TRY TO CONNECT AGAIN.

385
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:00,131
PLEASE, SIR.
THE LINES DOWN.

386
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:02,588
BERNIE? HOW ARE YOU?
HOW'S WORK?

387
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,634
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN ONE OF THOSE DAYS.
BUT HOW ARE YOU?

388
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:08,845
HEY! YOU'RE NOT THE RADAR TECHNICIAN ARE YA?
NO.

389
00:30:08,847 --> 00:30:11,515
I WAS ORDERED TO HOLE UP
HERE TILL THE STORM PASSES.

390
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:13,549
CAN'T GET MY EYE TO MY LIGHTSHIP.

391
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,489
YOU CAN WAIT IN THE MESS HALL IF YOU WANT TO.

392
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,883
NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME, UH...YOU KNOW.

393
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:22,902
I GOTTA GET READY GO DOWN TO THE
PIER AND TO TIE SOME BOATS.

394
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,200
I WISH YOU WERE WITH ME.

395
00:30:24,202 --> 00:30:27,548
I HEAR ABOUT SORTS OF THINGS ABOUT
A SHIP BREAKING UP AND I...

396
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,961
OH!

397
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:29,466
WHAT, ARE YOU OKAY?

398
00:30:30,524 --> 00:30:32,437
YEAH, WE JUST LOST THE LIGHT.

399
00:30:33,321 --> 00:30:35,115
YOU BETTER GO FIND 'EM THEN.

400
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:38,421
NANTUCKET HAS DISPATCHED THEIR
36 FOOTER TO THE MARIE...

401
00:30:39,143 --> 00:30:41,339
YOU ASKED CLUFF YET?
THAT HIM, RIGHT?

402
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:43,452
NO...NOT YET, SWEETHEART.

403
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,095
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER, I GOTTA GO.
GOOD.

404
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,391
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU TOO.

405
00:30:49,393 --> 00:30:50,783
BYE.

406
00:30:56,244 --> 00:30:59,530
THE BEST THING IS THAT SHE
HAD NO IDEA WHO I WAS.

407
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,488
BANGS?

408
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:04,519
PICK YOURSELF A CREW.
TAKE THE 36500 TO THE OLD HARBOR.

409
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:08,370
PROCEED TO FORT MERCER,
20 MILES EAST OFF NANTUCKET, YOU HEAR?

410
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:12,288
AH! I DON'T...DON'T BELIEVE WE WOULD GET
OVER THE BAR WITH THIS WEATER, MR.CLUFF.

411
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,421
WE ARE BETTER OFF TAKING THE
36383 OFF THE STAGE HARBOR.

412
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:17,690
ABOUT TAKE LONG RIGHT?

413
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:19,605
NOT MUCH.

414
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,875
WHAT DO YOU THINK, WEBBER?
OH?

415
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:26,649
YOU'RE BOATS-MATE.
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS OUT THERE.

416
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:30,351
NOW LOOK, NOBODYS GOIN' OVER THE BAR
IN THIS WEATHER, MR.CLUFF. NOBODY.

417
00:31:30,353 --> 00:31:31,809
IT'S A SUICIDE MISSION.

418
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:34,848
WE SHOULD TAKE OUT THE
36383 OUTTA STAGE HARBOR.

419
00:31:35,063 --> 00:31:37,926
TAKES A LITTLE...SURE.
BUT ATLEAST YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET OUT.

420
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:48,608
GODSPEED, CHIEF.

421
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:53,079
LET GOUTHRO LIVESEY DOWN THE FISHING PIER.
YES, SIR.

422
00:33:07,392 --> 00:33:10,521
DON'T GET ME SICK, GUS.
YOU SHOULD'T EVEN BE OUT HERE.

423
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:12,890
WHY YOU ALWAYS DRAGGING US, RICHIE?

424
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:15,168
DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON US JUST 'CAUSE
YOU AIN'T ROLLIN' WITH BANGS.

425
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:18,115
ATLEAST WE'LL GET OUT!
WE WON'T, SCREW YOU! THAT WAS A YEAR AGO!

426
00:33:18,282 --> 00:33:19,324
SCREW YOU!?

427
00:33:19,491 --> 00:33:22,621
NO ONE COULD HAVE GOT OVER THE BAR THAT DAY.
BANGS DID IT.

428
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:25,917
OH! REALLY, RICHIE?
HE'S NOT TRYING TO GET ACROSS THE BAR TODAY!

429
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:30,131
NO, HE SAYS TAKE THE 36383 RIGHT OFF
FROM THE NICE PROTECTED BAY SITE.

430
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:31,331
AH!

431
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,350
BERNIE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT RICHIE THINKS...

432
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:42,481
BANGS OR WHOEVER THINKS. NOBODY.

433
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:46,278
NO ONE COULD HAVE SAVED THOSE MEN AT THE LANGERY.

434
00:33:47,071 --> 00:33:51,535
SOMETIMES YOU KNOW...MEN DIE, BERNIE.

435
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:26,290
ALRIGHT, HERE WE GO.

436
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,550
ALRIGHT, HANG ON.
NOW, EASY FELLAS.

437
00:34:33,717 --> 00:34:36,101
GOT IT.
OK, NOW UP, UP, UP, UP.

438
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:41,603
ONE, TWO...ALL TOGETHER NOW.

439
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:46,359
THREE.

440
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:52,923
NICELY DONE BOYS!
NOW TIE IT.

441
00:34:52,993 --> 00:34:56,205
ALRIGHT! NOW WE GOT A TILLER.
NOW WE GONNA DRIVE HER IN A SHORE.

442
00:34:56,373 --> 00:35:00,065
AH! AH! BROWN AND THEM OTHERS ARE GETTING
READY TO RISE SOME LIFEBOATS.

443
00:35:00,085 --> 00:35:01,845
THEY THINK IT'S THEIR BEST HOPE.

444
00:35:01,945 --> 00:35:03,845
OH, POP!

445
00:35:05,218 --> 00:35:09,265
WE NEED EVERY GUY WE GOT!
WELL...THEY'RE GONNA GRAB THOSE LIFEBOATS.

446
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,894
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO, SYBERT?
GET OFF OF HIM.

447
00:35:45,731 --> 00:35:48,110
YOU TRYING TO KILL US?
YOU TRYING TO KILL US?

448
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:50,863
TAKE IT EASY.
STAND UP.

449
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,034
YOU'RE OUTTA YOUR MIND!
HE JUST SAVED YOUR LIFE.

450
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:57,831
THE BOAT IS IN PIECES.
IT'S GONE, ENOUGH!

451
00:36:02,337 --> 00:36:04,757
THAT BOAT IS TOO SMALL FOR THIS SEAS.

452
00:36:04,923 --> 00:36:09,430
AND THIS BOAT WILL BE SUNK BY NIGHT FALL.

453
00:36:09,597 --> 00:36:10,932
EVERY FELLAR WHO WANTS TO LIVE...

454
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:15,146
AND THE ONLY WAY THAT HAPPENS
IS IF WE RUN HER RUN AGROUND.

455
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,363
WE SETUP A WATCH AND LOOK OUT FOR A SHORE.

456
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,325
I NEED FOUR MEN WORKING THE PULLEYS
ON THE EMERGENCY TILLER.

457
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:27,288
I NEED FOUR MEN MANNING THE PUMP,
AFT THE STEERIN'...

458
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:30,292
AND THE REST OF YOU BUCKET TOP SIDE BELOW...

459
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,503
AND COMMUNICATES WITH THE ENGINE ROOM.

460
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:39,054
AND SOMEBODY...KEEP BLOWING THAT WHISTLE.

461
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,974
YOU HEARD HIM, BOYS.
NOW MOVE IT! COME ON!

462
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:49,108
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE THE MAN NOW, SYBERT.

463
00:36:51,737 --> 00:36:54,533
HOPE YOU JUST DIDN'T KILL US ALL.

464
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:15,979
I SAW A SHIP DRIFTIN'.
HEARD IT WHISTLE.

465
00:37:16,145 --> 00:37:19,108
A DISTRESS SIGNAL.
45 MINUTES AGO, BERNIE.

466
00:37:19,274 --> 00:37:20,276
FROM MY HOUSE!

467
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:26,075
AH! THE WIND'S BLOWIN' SOUTH,
AND THOSE CURRENTS, I...

468
00:37:27,035 --> 00:37:30,631
I GUESS THAT'LL PUT UP HERE
ABOUT COMIN' NEAR OVER THE BAR.

469
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,002
CAN'T BE PART OF THE MERCER, BERNIE.

470
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,795
SHE'S OFF NANTUCKET, 40 MILES...

471
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:37,358
MEANS SHE WOULD'VE DRIFTED NORTHWEST, RIGHT?

472
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:42,055
I KNOW WHAT I HEARD.
KNOW WHAT I SAW.

473
00:37:46,478 --> 00:37:47,605
OK, THEN...EH.

474
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:52,569
HOW ABOUT WE GO BACK TO THE STATION
AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT?

475
00:37:53,613 --> 00:37:55,490
JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH BOSTON.

476
00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:57,535
THEY DIVERTED A PLANE TO MERCER...

477
00:37:57,701 --> 00:38:01,666
THIS SIDE OF THE STERN OF THE TANK FROM HAMILTON
5 MILES OF PENDLETON EAST OF HERE.

478
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:06,923
MY GOD! TWO TANKERS BROKEN IN HALF?
IN ONE DAY? IT'S GOTTA BE SOME KINDA RECORD.

479
00:38:07,506 --> 00:38:10,803
BOSTON AND NANTUCKET HAVE DISPATCHED
ALL BOATS TO THE MERCER.

480
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:13,097
THEY CAN'T MAKE IT IN THIS WEATHER.

481
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:43,222
WEBBER, PICK YOURSELF A CREW.
TAKE THAT 36500 AND GO OVER THE BAR...

482
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,309
AND FIND THE STERN OF THE PENDLETON.
YOU HEAR?

483
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,857
YES, SIR.

484
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:05,585
YOU FELLAS WANNA GET WARMED UP?
GET SOME COFFEE.

485
00:39:07,285 --> 00:39:08,585
BERNIE?

486
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,761
WHAT?

487
00:39:15,682 --> 00:39:18,936
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE LANDRY.
OH! SURE IT IS.

488
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:22,065
RITCHIE, EIGHT MEN DIED THAT NIGHT.

489
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:28,324
YOU, GUS AND MASACHI COULDN'T EVEN GET OUT.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT NOW?

490
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:34,522
YOU KNOW THE BAR ON THIS COUNTY, BERNIE?
YEAH.

491
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:37,103
THE MAN DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOIN'.
HE'S SENDIN' YOU OUT TO DIE.

492
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:41,384
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT OVER CHATHAM BAR
ON A DAY LIKE THIS.

493
00:39:41,551 --> 00:39:44,471
YOU CAN'T STAY AFLOAT LONG
ENOUGH FOR HALF SHIP, NEITHER.

494
00:39:49,562 --> 00:39:52,816
YOU KNOW, MR.STELLO, THE COAST GUARD,
THEY SAY, 'YOU GOTTA GO OUT'.

495
00:39:52,982 --> 00:39:54,835
BUT THEY DON'T SAY, 'YOU GOTTA COME BACK IN'.

496
00:39:56,154 --> 00:39:57,322
THAT'S REGULATION, YOU KNOW.

497
00:39:57,488 --> 00:40:00,577
BERNIE, BEFORE YOU GET TOO FAR OUT THERE.

498
00:40:00,743 --> 00:40:02,788
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, MR.RYDER.

499
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:05,834
I CAN'T GET LOST OUT THERE.
I KNOW THESE WATERS PRETTY GOOD.

500
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,169
HOW CAN I GET LOST?

501
00:40:07,336 --> 00:40:10,256
NO, NO, NO BERNIE.
WHAT DAVE'S TRYIN' TO SAY...

502
00:40:10,423 --> 00:40:14,011
IS THAT YOU SHOULD MOTOR AROUND THE HARBOR,
SAY YOU TRIED TO GET OUT, BUT COULDN'T...YOU KNOW?

503
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:22,732
THANK YOU, MR.RYDER.
THANK YOU.

504
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,737
BUT MR.STELLO, I'M GONNA DO
THE BEST TO GET OUT THERE.

505
00:40:26,903 --> 00:40:29,324
I DON'T KNOW IF IF I DON'T,
BUT I'M GONNA TRY.

506
00:41:00,593 --> 00:41:01,893
OK.

507
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:05,039
I GUESS RICHIE'S IN?
WHO ELSE?

508
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:10,212
I DON'T KNOW, GUS.
YOU BARELY CAN LIFT YOUR HEAD.

509
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:13,884
WHO ELSE YOU GONNA TAKE, BERNIE?
FITZ IS THE ONLY OTHER ENGINE-MAN LEFT.

510
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:17,764
AND HE IS ONLY THIRD CLASS,
AND HE AIN'T GOT THE EXPERIENCE.

511
00:41:19,183 --> 00:41:23,564
I'M CAN GO.
YEAH, I CAN...I CAN DO THE JOB.

512
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,276
I MEAN, I CAN DO IT.
YOU CAN'T GO.

513
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:31,908
YOU'RE AS SICK AS A DOG, GUS.
HE'S RIGHT, GUS.

514
00:41:35,663 --> 00:41:36,998
ONE MORE?

515
00:41:42,506 --> 00:41:45,061
SOMEONE HAS TO GO OUT,
SAVE THOSE GUYS, RIGHT?

516
00:41:46,553 --> 00:41:49,766
THAT'S WHY I SIGNED UP.
THINK NOW IS MY CHANCE.

517
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:54,689
SAILOR ERVIN MASKE, STONEHORSE LIGHTSHIP.

518
00:43:10,834 --> 00:43:12,352
PUMPS AREN'T KEEPIN' UP.

519
00:43:13,379 --> 00:43:18,845
THREE MORE FEET...BEFORE WE LOSE THE ENGINES.

520
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,889
YOU LOCKED THOSE BOILER ROOMS, FULL?

521
00:43:20,956 --> 00:43:25,162
YOU'RE CRAZY TO THINK YOU CAN CONTROL
WITH A FEW ROPES AND A TILLER, BUD.

522
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:28,441
YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?
I'M ALL EARS.

523
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:33,907
THERE!
A SHORE ABOUT A MILE DISTANCE.

524
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,285
WE CAN MAKE THAT!

525
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:40,290
RUDDER, 15 DEGREES TO PORT.
HALF SPEED IF WE WANNA HIT IT HEAD-ON.

526
00:43:40,457 --> 00:43:43,504
GOTTA MAKE A 80 DEGREES TURN
ON THE COMPASS TO 3,10,

527
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:52,766
RUDDER, 15 DEGREES TO PORT. HALF SPEED.
80 DEGREES AT 3:10 ON COMPASS.

528
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:56,437
15 DEGREES TO PORT. HALF SPEED.
80 DEGREES AT 3:10 ON COMPASS.

529
00:43:56,604 --> 00:44:00,317
RUDDER, 15 DEGREES TO PORT. HALF SPEED.
80 DEGREES AT 3:10 ON COMPASS.

530
00:44:25,393 --> 00:44:28,856
RUDDER, 15 DEGREES TO PORT. HALF SPEED.
80 DEGREES AT 3:10 ON COMPASS.

531
00:44:29,023 --> 00:44:30,608
THANK YOU, ELDON.

532
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:47,506
OK, GUYS? NOW PULL, PULL, PULL. COME ON!

533
00:45:14,335 --> 00:45:17,381
PLEASE TELL ME THAT WE ARE TAKING
THAT BOAT TO A BIGGER BOAT.

534
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:19,967
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ON A RESCUE MISSION BEFORE?
NO.

535
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:24,682
USUALLY CHIP PAINT.
SOMETIMES I COOK FOR THE BOYS.

536
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:26,768
GREAT!

537
00:45:30,758 --> 00:45:35,847
ALRIGHT, YOU TAKE THE GLORY HOLE.
MASKY. ERVIN, MASKY.

538
00:45:35,947 --> 00:45:37,347
ERVIN, YEAH.

539
00:45:36,014 --> 00:45:39,101
RICHIE, DROP THE MOORING LINE WHEN YOU CAN.

540
00:45:44,824 --> 00:45:46,985
THE LAST KNOWN POSITION OF THE PENDLETON IS HERE.

541
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:50,781
SO I FUGURE, ONCE WE CROSS THE BAR,
I RECKON THE CURRENTS...

542
00:45:51,323 --> 00:45:54,118
DRIFTED ABOUT HERE.
THAT'S 6 MILES FROM US.

543
00:46:02,503 --> 00:46:05,840
SO YOU THINK THAT BERNIE CAN
GET US OUT PAST BAR ON THIS?

544
00:46:06,007 --> 00:46:08,218
I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.

545
00:46:08,385 --> 00:46:12,305
YEAH, I MEAN IT'S GOTTA BE FAILURE.
HOPE HE DOESN'T PITCH-BOWL, THAT'S ALL.

546
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:17,020
THE POWER ON THE WAVES IN THAT BAR,
CAN PICK YOU UP...

547
00:46:17,186 --> 00:46:20,231
AND THEY CAN TAG YOU IN
FOR OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

548
00:46:20,398 --> 00:46:23,318
THERE IS NO WAY TO SURVIVE THAT.
THAT'S A PITCH-BOWL.

549
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:44,050
HEY FITZ, WE GOOD?
GIVE IT A SHOT.

550
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,979
REEL THE LINES.
LINES REELED.

551
00:47:35,275 --> 00:47:38,696
DID BERNIE GO OUT, GUS?
MIRIAM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

552
00:47:39,947 --> 00:47:43,576
DID HE?
YEAH, CLUFF DID.

553
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,830
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

554
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:49,290
WHO?
CLUFF.

555
00:47:49,457 --> 00:47:51,127
YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER.
WHERE IS HE?

556
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:55,006
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHERE BERNIE IS.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

557
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,382
WE ARE SUPOSED TO GET MARRIED.

558
00:47:56,549 --> 00:48:01,472
MIRIAM, THIS ISN'T WHAT THE OTHER GIRLS DO.
OR WIVES!

559
00:48:02,598 --> 00:48:04,933
THEY DON'T COME IN HERE,
AND THEY DON'T DO THIS.

560
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:08,813
SO?

561
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:19,825
IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN WAIT IN HERE.
LISTEN TO WHAT IS GOING ON.

562
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:23,998
SIT DOWN.

563
00:49:09,758 --> 00:49:13,136
TIDES RISIN'.
COULD'VE DROVE ACROSS THE SHORE.

564
00:49:13,303 --> 00:49:16,181
WE NEED TO HIT IT HARD.
YEAH, THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.

565
00:49:16,974 --> 00:49:18,017
WAVE!

566
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:43,587
YOU FEEL THAT? WE'RE DRIFTING.
MUST'VE LOST THE TILLER.

567
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:47,885
WE'RE GONNA SLOW DEAD-WEIGHT OR
WE GONNA MISS THE SHORE...DO IT.

568
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,474
CUT THE GOVERNOR VALVE, STOP THE PROPULSION.
ISOLATE THE BOILER.

569
00:49:53,641 --> 00:49:56,019
WE'RE GOTTA CONSERVE EVERYTHING SHE GOT LEFT .

570
00:49:56,227 --> 00:50:00,149
I CONTINUE TO TELL YOU, BOULOO.
THIS BOAT JUST BAD LUCK.

571
00:50:00,357 --> 00:50:04,445
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LUCK.

572
00:50:36,773 --> 00:50:41,404
STATION CHATHAM, THIS IS THE CG-36500,
DO YOU COPY?

573
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:45,447
THIS IS STATION CHATHAM.
36500, WHERE'S YOUR LOCATION, OVER?

574
00:50:45,867 --> 00:50:49,538
STATION CHATHAM, WE ARE NOW PASSING MORRIS ISLAND.

575
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:53,668
DOWN THE SHELL TOWARDS THE CHATHAM BAR.
OVER.

576
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,297
WHAT DOES IT MEAN GOING OVER THE BAR?
MIRIAM, DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF.

577
00:50:57,464 --> 00:50:58,798
WHY NOT?

578
00:51:00,007 --> 00:51:01,343
WHY NOT, GUS?

579
00:51:02,761 --> 00:51:04,513
WHEN I'M GONNA BE WITH HIM, I WANNA KNOW.

580
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:14,358
YOU'RE THE GIRL WITH THE BEAR-COAT, RIGHT?
YEAH..THAT'S ME!

581
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:20,240
YOU GONNA TELL ME,
WHAT'S IT'S LIKE UP THERE?

582
00:51:23,285 --> 00:51:26,748
SHOLES ON THAT BAR ARE NEVER THE SAME PLACE, TWICE.

583
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:30,459
FLOOD CURRENTS CARRIN' THEM...

584
00:51:30,627 --> 00:51:33,963
BIG OCEAN SWEELS AND RISE UP AND
THEY SHELL CRASH UP AGAINST THAT BAR.

585
00:51:34,548 --> 00:51:37,425
OUT TIDE GO CRASHING AGAINST THE BAR.

586
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:44,058
THAT MAN SHOULDN'T HAVE SENT THOSE
MEN IN A STORM LIKE THIS..

587
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:50,691
MAYBE THEY CAN TURN BACK.
MAYBE THEY GET LOST BEFORE.

588
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,151
CAN'T GET OUT.

589
00:51:55,905 --> 00:52:01,453
YOU KNOW BERNIE, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW HE WON'T GET LOST OUT THERE.

590
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:07,752
YOU KNOW HE FOLLOWS THE RULES.
YEAH, WE KNOW.

591
00:52:09,212 --> 00:52:13,926
WE ALL GOING DOWN TO THE PIER TOO.
SEE IF WE CAN DO ANYTHING DOWN THERE.

592
00:52:17,263 --> 00:52:18,847
WELCOME TO COME.

593
00:52:30,611 --> 00:52:32,363
MIRIAM...MARIAM, PLEASE COME HERE.

594
00:52:32,563 --> 00:52:33,863
MARIAM?

595
00:52:36,743 --> 00:52:39,831
EXCUSE ME, ARE YOU COMMANDER CLUFF?
WHO ARE YOU?

596
00:52:39,897 --> 00:52:43,310
I'M MIRIAM PENTINEN, BERNIE WEBBER'S GIRLFRIEND.
I WANT YOU TO CALL BERNIE, BACK IN.

597
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:45,878
THE GIRL HE ASKED ME.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTED TO ASK?

598
00:52:46,839 --> 00:52:51,635
FOR YOUR PERMISSION TO MARRY ME.
THAT'S BETWEEN YOU, HIM AND YOUR GOD.

599
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:54,771
ASKING ME IS JUST A FORMALITY.
HE CAN MARRY ALL HE WANTS.

600
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:58,643
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT?
BUT YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE, MISS.

601
00:52:58,810 --> 00:52:59,810
IT IS BERNIE.

602
00:52:59,853 --> 00:53:03,357
CHATHAM BAR STRAIGHT AHEAD, OVER.
36500, STATION CHATHAM.

603
00:53:03,523 --> 00:53:06,277
PROCEED AS DIRECTED, TOWARDS PENDLETON STERN.

604
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:10,657
I DIDN'T COPY THAT, STATION CHATHAM.
THE CONDITIONS ARE EXTREME.

605
00:53:10,824 --> 00:53:13,953
WHY GIVE HIM PERMISSION IF
YOU'RE SENDING HIM OUT TO DIE?

606
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:19,000
WHAT THE HELL!
GOUTHRO, GET HER OUT OF HERE!

607
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:24,046
SIR, WIND HAS GONE OFF FROM 40 TO 60,
SINCE THEY FIRST GOT OFF IN.

608
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:27,718
THAT WILL BE HURRICANE STRENGTH IN AN HOUR.
GOUTHRO, HE GOT HIS ORDERS.

609
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:32,014
YOU GET HER OUTTA HERE, AND YOU GET TO BED.
YOU'RE TOO SICK TO BE IN HERE.

610
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:44,821
36500, STATION CHATHAM,
PROCEED OVER THE BAR.

611
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,157
I REPEAT, PROCEED.

612
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:49,753
ONCE OVER IT, TRAVEL SOUTH....

613
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:51,954
RADAR'S EMITTING.
SHOWIN' A PEP.

614
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:57,335
ABOUT 10 MILES EAST OF MONOMOY POINT OVER SOUTH.
OVER.

615
00:53:58,628 --> 00:54:03,842
STATION CHATHAM, THIS IS THE 500, COPY THAT.

616
00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:21,236
I HEAR WHAT EVERYONES SAYING.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

617
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:27,661
EXCUSE ME?
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT FROM HERE.

618
00:54:27,828 --> 00:54:29,828
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW IT'S THERE.

619
00:54:29,928 --> 00:54:32,916
WHAT THE HELL WOULD YOU KNOW,
HOW IT'S LIKE THERE, MISS? HMM?

620
00:54:34,002 --> 00:54:35,753
PLEASE JUST CALL THEM BACK.

621
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,132
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE LIKE,
MARRIED TO A COAST GUARD, MARIAM?

622
00:54:39,299 --> 00:54:40,759
PLEASE, CALL JUST THEM BACK.

623
00:54:40,927 --> 00:54:43,887
YOU GONNA COME IN HERE, SCARED,
EVERYTIME HE'S IN THE WATER?

624
00:54:44,054 --> 00:54:47,225
PLEASE CALL THEM BACK.
YOU, DON'T BELONG HERE.

625
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:52,815
PLEASE CALL THEM BACK.
GET OUT OF HERE! GET OUTTA MY STATION.

626
00:54:52,982 --> 00:54:56,525

00:54:56,652 --> 00:54:58,779
GET OUT MY STATION!

00:55:59,766 --> 00:56:01,560
SHORE'S GETTIN' BEHIND US.

629
00:56:03,395 --> 00:56:06,399
ONLY CHANCE NOW IS A HARD TURN,
IF THE CHAINS HOLD...BUT,

630
00:56:07,357 --> 00:56:08,794
IT COULD CAPSIZE US.

631
00:56:27,715 --> 00:56:28,924
THAT'S GOOD WORK.

632
00:56:44,024 --> 00:56:45,985
YOU NEED TO STAND CLEAR, BOYS.

633
00:56:46,151 --> 00:56:50,323
THOSE SHACKLES CRACK, THESE CHAINS SNAP
AND RIP RIGHT THROUGH YA.

634
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,326
HERE WE GO.

635
00:57:01,837 --> 00:57:03,756

636
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:19,607
YOU HEAR THAT?
THAT'S IT! THAT'S THE BAR.

637
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,907
COUPLA MINUTES NOW, BOYS.

638
00:57:34,248 --> 00:57:38,378
* WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY *

639
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:44,468
* HOLD MY MOTHER, TOLD ME *

640
00:57:44,636 --> 00:57:47,889

641
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:54,563
* WE ON OUR WAY, JOE *

642
00:57:55,022 --> 00:57:58,401
* I FIRST MET A YANKEE GIRL *

643
00:57:58,902 --> 00:58:02,572
* SHE WAS FAT AND LAZY TUMMY! *

644
00:58:02,739 --> 00:58:09,413
* WAY HO WAY HO *
* WAY HO WAY HO...JOE *

645
00:58:10,164 --> 00:58:16,589
* THEN I MET AN IRISH GIRL *
* WHO DAM ME, MADE ME CRAZY...TUMMY *

646
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:24,430
* WAY HO WAY HO *

647
00:58:24,931 --> 00:58:30,980

648
00:58:32,147 --> 00:58:39,280
* WAY HO WAY HO *
* WE ARE ALL WAY, JOE *

649
00:59:00,555 --> 00:59:05,310
HEY BOYS! WE WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE MUCH, ALRIGHT?

650
00:59:05,477 --> 00:59:10,525
SO WE GOTTA LISTEN TO THOSE WAVES HITTIN' THAT BAR.

651
00:59:10,858 --> 00:59:16,448
SO I'M GONNA WAIT FOR A LOW, AND THEN WE GO.
WE GOT FAITH IN YOU, SKIP.

652
00:59:16,948 --> 00:59:20,244
ANYTIME YOU'RE READY, YOU JUST GO, BERNIE.
ALRIGHT?

653
01:00:53,725 --> 01:00:55,436
THE COMPASS IS GONE.

654
01:01:23,176 --> 01:01:25,054
FITZY, THE ENGINE DIED.

655
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,647
I'VE GOT IT. I GOT IT.
NAH, YOU DON'T.

656
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:42,698
YOU GOT ABOUT FIVE SECONDS, BOYS.

657
01:01:42,764 --> 01:01:46,160
IT'S GRAVITY PAD, IT DOESN'T TRACE OUT...
I KNOW!

658
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:53,376
COME ON, LIGHT UP!

659
01:02:15,486 --> 01:02:17,528
MASKE? GET BACK HERE.

660
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:27,124
TIDE'S RISING! IT'LL GET US THROUGH.

661
01:02:29,084 --> 01:02:31,086
BUT LET ME KNOW WHAT'S COMING.

662
01:04:24,758 --> 01:04:28,928
HEY FITZ!? WE'VE BEEN OVER THE BAR.
BACK TO SPOTLIGHT.

663
01:04:32,933 --> 01:04:33,976
COMIN' OUT.

664
01:04:48,758 --> 01:04:50,794
WE TURNED TOO LATE!

665
01:04:52,678 --> 01:04:54,680
WE GOTTA BUY TIME BACK!

666
01:04:54,847 --> 01:04:59,517
TELL SYBERT WE NEED 30 DEGREES WITHIN THE
NEXT TWO MINUTES OR WE'LL MISS THAT SHOLE.

667
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:04,021
30 DEGREES IN THE NEXT TWO MINUTES..

668
01:05:04,189 --> 01:05:07,149
30 DEGREES IN THE NEXT TWO MINUTES..

669
01:05:07,316 --> 01:05:10,527
30 DEGREES IN THE NEXT TWO MINUTES..

670
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:12,829
30 DEGREES IN THE NEXT TWO MINUTES..

671
01:05:18,243 --> 01:05:21,579
PUTTIN' HER IN REVERSE.
YOU GOTTA LET THE OCEAN PUSH US.

672
01:05:22,872 --> 01:05:24,081
HOLD ON.

673
01:06:28,846 --> 01:06:30,847
MAYBE YOU WANNA BRACE YOURSELF, ELDON.

674
01:06:33,058 --> 01:06:34,476
318...

675
01:06:39,939 --> 01:06:41,899
316...

676
01:06:42,525 --> 01:06:46,844
CLOSE IT DOWN AS SOON AS SHE HITS!

677
01:06:47,321 --> 01:06:48,905
312...

678
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,792
GENTLEMEN! BRACE YOURSELVES.

679
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:05,670
HOLD ON!

680
01:07:12,134 --> 01:07:13,677
NOW!

681
01:08:17,025 --> 01:08:18,158
WELL...

682
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:26,866
YOU DID IT! IT BLOODY WELL WORKED, MR.SYBERT!

683
01:08:30,244 --> 01:08:33,664
YOU GOTTA KEEP THE WATER AWAY FROM
THE AIR INLETS OF THE ENGINE.

684
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:37,208
WE LOSE POWER, WE LOSE OUR PUMPS.

685
01:08:39,169 --> 01:08:42,922
I'M AFRAID, THE WAY WE'RE PULLIN' SO MUCH WATER,
WAVE WILL PULL US OFF THE SHOLE.

686
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:49,861
FEELS FUNNY NOT MOVIN AROUND, HUH ELDON?

687
01:08:53,515 --> 01:08:56,725
ALRIGHT, LETS GET TO IT.

688
01:09:21,456 --> 01:09:23,791
WE ARE HEADIN' DOWN TO THE LODGE.
EVERTHING OK?

689
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,210
QUITE DOWN NOW, MY GOD!
GIVE ME A BREAK.

690
01:09:26,376 --> 01:09:30,555
I WAS ON MY WAY HOME AND MY CAR'S BEEN OUT INTO A DITCH.
I NEED SOME HELP.

691
01:09:31,423 --> 01:09:33,024
YEAH ALRIGHT, WE LIVE NEARBY.

692
01:09:33,091 --> 01:09:36,210
WE'LL GO BACK TO MY HOUSE. CALL MY BROTHER.
HE CAN TILL YOU OUT. JUMP IN.

693
01:09:40,556 --> 01:09:42,641
THANK YOU.
YOU DON'T GOT A COAT?

694
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:46,978
YOU CAN MOVE THAT.
WE'RE BRINGIN' THAT FROM ST.MARTIN'S SURVIVORS.

695
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:53,442
I LEFT MY COAT AT THE COAST GUARD STATION.
GOTTA MAN THERE?

696
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:54,818
STOP IT.

697
01:09:58,071 --> 01:09:59,906
HE IS NOT THERE NOW RIGHT NOW.
IT'S A...

698
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:05,953
IT IS BERNIE WEBBER.
YEAH, BERNIE IS A GOOD MAN.

699
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,595
WE CAN'T FIND 'EM WITHOUT A COMPASS, BERNIE.

700
01:10:27,054 --> 01:10:29,098
WE GOT NO IDEA WHERE THEY ARE.

701
01:10:32,351 --> 01:10:33,560
HOLD ON.

702
01:11:05,172 --> 01:11:06,923
YOU OKAY?

703
01:11:07,882 --> 01:11:11,886
YOU OKAY?
I'M HAVIN' A GREAT TIME OUT HERE, BERNIE!

704
01:11:12,053 --> 01:11:13,379
WHOLE LOT! WHOLE LOTTA FUN HERE.

705
01:11:18,349 --> 01:11:19,909
BRACE YOURSELVES!

706
01:11:33,196 --> 01:11:35,907
IT'S REALLY NICE HERE.

707
01:11:43,497 --> 01:11:47,917
TAKE IT, USE IT.
CONSIDER IT DONE.

708
01:11:54,521 --> 01:11:55,982
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT!?
WE LOST THE PUMPS.

709
01:11:56,049 --> 01:11:59,469
THE PUMPS ARE CHOKIN' THE BREAKERS.
GO CHECK THE CONNECTIONS.

710
01:12:01,972 --> 01:12:03,181
GIVE ME THE LIGHT.

711
01:12:04,557 --> 01:12:09,061
IT'S ONET OF THOSE DAMN...
SOMETIMES I WISH I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

712
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:12,064
SYBERT, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

713
01:12:14,023 --> 01:12:16,067
WE'RE USIN' EVERY PUMP WE GOT.

714
01:12:17,026 --> 01:12:19,762
THE JAM THE BREAKERS AND
THE PUMPS WOULDN'T TRICKLE.

715
01:12:19,828 --> 01:12:24,241
WE GOT ANOTHER TWO FEET OF WATER BEFORE IT HITS
THE AIR IN ENGINE AND THEN THE SHIP'S DEAD.

716
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:26,844
JESUS CHRIST.
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

717
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:32,131
THE TIDE'S RISING WORKIN' US UP THE SHOLE.
FELLAS, THAT GIVE US SOME TIME.

718
01:12:32,832 --> 01:12:35,917
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MR.SYBERT?
THAT'S SURE, IS BUB.

719
01:12:36,877 --> 01:12:39,796
AS LONG AS THE GENERATORS KEEP THE PUMPS GOIN'.

720
01:12:41,506 --> 01:12:43,649
BY HOWEVER WE BUY SOME MORE TIME.

721
01:12:43,716 --> 01:12:45,926
YOU WANNA BE TO BE THE MAN, SYBERT RIGHT?
WELL NOW YOU ARE THE MAN.

722
01:12:46,677 --> 01:12:49,179
YOU GOT NO WIFE, GOT NO KIDS BACK HOME?

723
01:12:50,848 --> 01:12:55,935
YOU'RE A SINGLE MAN ALWAYS HIDIN' DOWN BELOW.
WHAT DO YOU GOTTA LOSE?

724
01:12:56,102 --> 01:12:57,386
ENOUGH, BROWN.

725
01:13:00,148 --> 01:13:02,107
I'M AFRAID, BROWN.

726
01:13:03,401 --> 01:13:05,193
GOTTA A LIFE, SAME AS YOU.

727
01:13:10,031 --> 01:13:12,825
JUST DON'T SEE SITTIN' AROUND,
TALKIN' ABOUT IT.

728
01:13:17,371 --> 01:13:22,684
STATION CHATHAM, 36500.
STATION CHATHAM, 36500, DO YOU COPY?

729
01:13:22,751 --> 01:13:27,454
STATION CHATHAM,

POLLOCK LIGHTSHIP, CG-36500, DO YOU COPY?

731
01:13:32,717 --> 01:13:35,929
WHY CAN'T THEY HEAR US, BERNIE?

732
01:13:36,095 --> 01:13:40,299
TIDE IS TOO HIGH, ZERO HEAD WAY.
STATION CHATHAM, DO YOU COPY?

733
01:13:40,391 --> 01:13:41,985
I REPEAT, WE'RE COMIN' HOME.

STATION CHATHAM, 36383,
RETURN TO OLD HARBOR.

735
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:49,316
POLLOCK LIGHTSHIP, CG-36500, DO YOU COPY?

736
01:13:49,482 --> 01:13:51,150
WE ARE ALL ALONE.

737
01:13:51,943 --> 01:13:54,768
YOU HEARD, BANGS, ON THE RADIO LIKE HE'S

738
01:13:54,795 --> 01:13:57,723
AND THE STORM'S GETS WORSE...

739
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,009
WE MUST RETURN BACK, WEBBER.

740
01:14:01,577 --> 01:14:05,613
WE'VE COME FARTHER THAN ANYBODY
EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE, BERNIE!

741
01:14:06,456 --> 01:14:10,918
MAYBE RICHIE IS RIGHT!
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST GO BACK!

742
01:14:11,085 --> 01:14:17,423
THE WIND IS EIGHT TO NINE.
REPEAT, WIND EIGHT TO NINE. HEAVY SNOWFALL.

743
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:19,333
YOU HEARD BANGS ON THE RADIO.

744
01:14:19,467 --> 01:14:22,428
WE HAVE NO COMPASS AND
WE HAVE NO WAY TO COMMUNICATE.

745
01:14:25,981 --> 01:14:29,976
YOU ARE...
WHAT? WHAT? I'M WHAT RITCHIE?

746
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:37,191
I GOT US THIS FAR, DIDN'T I?
NOT BANGS NOT CLUFF, BUT I DID IT!

747
01:14:43,738 --> 01:14:45,240
WE DID IT, RICHIE.

748
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:50,745
YOU WANNA TURN BACK AROUND?

749
01:14:52,997 --> 01:14:56,299
NO, NOT NOW! WE CAME TOO FAR.

750
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,668
WE ARE NOT GONNA LEAVE 'EM.

751
01:15:01,295 --> 01:15:03,130
NOT ON MY WATCH.

752
01:15:05,633 --> 01:15:07,009
JUST DO YOUR JOB.

753
01:15:11,429 --> 01:15:14,515
HEY FITZ, TURN OFF THE BEAM.
WE'LL WORK IN THE DARK.

754
01:15:14,682 --> 01:15:18,018
WE CAN SEE THE LIGHT OF THE
PENDLETON BETTER IN THE DARK.

755
01:15:25,858 --> 01:15:27,235
WATCH IT.

756
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:34,441
GET BACK HERE.

757
01:15:36,701 --> 01:15:38,086
GET YOUR BUDS BACK HERE.

758
01:15:38,912 --> 01:15:40,955
I LOST MY HAT.

759
01:16:06,644 --> 01:16:07,953
YOU OKAY?

760
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:15,694
YEAH, I'M JUST TIRED.
COME ON.

761
01:16:20,406 --> 01:16:22,366
YOU KIDS GO PLAY IN THE BEDROOM, OK?

762
01:16:22,633 --> 01:16:24,777
YOU CAN WAIT.
LET ME CALL MY BROTHER.

763
01:16:24,797 --> 01:16:27,688
THANKS. CALL ME MARIAM.

764
01:16:45,003 --> 01:16:47,380
YOU THINK YOUR MOTHER WOULD
MIND IF I TURN ON THE RADIO?

765
01:16:54,478 --> 01:16:57,314
COAST BOSTON, THIS IS THE UNIMAK.

766
01:16:57,481 --> 01:17:00,558
WE ARE FIRST AT THE MERCER BOW
HER NOW AT THE PORT OF YAKUTAT.

767
01:17:00,624 --> 01:17:04,378
FOUR MERCER CREW MEMBERS JUMPED FROM THE DECK.
ALL ARE LOST.

768
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:08,866
I REPEAT, FOUR MEN LOST.
SEVERAL CREW MEMBERS HAVE HYPOTHERMIA.

769
01:17:09,032 --> 01:17:13,119
WE'LL WAIT FOR DAYBREAK TO ATTEMPT ANOTHER RESCUE.

770
01:17:14,996 --> 01:17:19,658
DOES NO GOOD LISTENIN' TO ALL THAT CHATTER, MARIAM.
BETTER TO LIVE NOT KNOWIN'.

771
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:26,552
...IT WOULD BE 1900 HOURS...

772
01:17:31,552 --> 01:17:34,554
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED TO BERNIE FOR?
WE ARE...

773
01:17:39,308 --> 01:17:41,269
WE'RE NOT MARRIED YET.

774
01:17:43,729 --> 01:17:47,015
I DIDN'T KNOW IF...
LIKE I SAID, BERNIE IS A GOOD MAN.

775
01:17:51,236 --> 01:17:55,573
HIM AND SOME OF THEM OTHERS TRY GETTIN' OUT ONE YEAR AGO SAVED MY HUSBAND ARNIE  
AND THE CREW OF THE LANDRY.

776
01:17:55,948 --> 01:17:59,285
THEY WERE OUT ON THE BOAT NIGHT TIME OFF
NANTUCKET WHEN THE BOAT STARTED TAKIN' WATER.

777
01:17:59,451 --> 01:18:01,203
A NIGHT JUST LIKE THIS.

01:18:02,413 --> 01:18:05,165
COME ON, WE GOTTA GET GOIN'.

01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:08,576

780
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:46,881
BECAUSE PEOPLE SAID SIT DOWN SIT DOWN,
LET YOU ROCK THE BOAT 753

781
01:18:48,215 --> 01:18:53,013
* CAUSE PEOPLE SAID SIT, DOWN SIT DOWN *

782
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:58,812

01:19:08,614 --> 01:19:10,375
* SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN *

784
01:19:54,694 --> 01:19:56,137
DO YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS?

785
01:19:57,214 --> 01:20:01,335
AIN'T BERNIE'S FAULT, CARLIN.
NO ONE'S FAULT. IT'S LIKE HER BLAMING YOU.

786
01:20:02,387 --> 01:20:03,680
FOR WHAT?

787
01:20:03,847 --> 01:20:07,159
YOU ARE THE ONE THAT TOLD ME THERE WAS NO
OTHER SHIP OUT THERE BECAUSE OF YOU, RIGHT?

788
01:21:24,317 --> 01:21:27,153
FITZ, TURN ON THE SEARCHLIGHT.

789
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,398
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE FOUND HER.
LOOK AT THAT!

790
01:22:22,678 --> 01:22:26,558
WE'RE TOO LATE.
IT'S A GHOST SHIP.

791
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,101
ARE YOU SEEING THIS, SIR?
YEAH.

792
01:22:33,201 --> 01:22:35,901
YEAH, YEAH...I SEE HIM.

793
01:22:35,777 --> 01:22:37,529
NOT SURE I BELIEVE IT!

794
01:22:40,782 --> 01:22:42,952
WHERE IS THE HELL'S HE GOIN'?

795
01:22:51,337 --> 01:22:52,922
GOOD TO SEE YOU BOYS.

796
01:22:59,728 --> 01:23:01,228
CAREFUL.

797
01:23:07,982 --> 01:23:13,154
HOW ARE WE GONNA FIT THEM ALL ON THIS BOAT?
WE WERE TOLD TO FIT ONLY 12, INCLUDING US.

798
01:23:14,665 --> 01:23:16,367
THOSE ARE JUST REGULATION, RIGHT?

799
01:23:20,872 --> 01:23:22,415
HOW MANY COULD YOU FIT?

800
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:25,502
20, 22 TOPS.

801
01:23:28,131 --> 01:23:29,298
WAIT.

802
01:23:29,465 --> 01:23:31,134
THEY COMIN' OUT HERE.

803
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:57,173
TRY THE STATION, PORT SIDE.

BERNIE AIN'T OUT THERE, 'CAUSE OF ME.

814
01:25:40,588 --> 01:25:43,040
IT'S BERNIE'S JOB TO GO OUT, RIGHT?

815
01:25:46,544 --> 01:25:48,380
HOW CAN I BLAME ME FOR IT?

816
01:26:03,898 --> 01:26:08,153
NICE AND SLOW! NICE AND SLOW.
PETE, YOU'RE UP NEXT.

01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,199

01:26:19,409 --> 01:26:21,752
WE GOTTA GO!

01:26:21,919 --> 01:26:24,614
GO ON THAT LADDER, ELDON.
WE GOTTA GET HIM DOWN.

820
01:26:24,656 --> 01:26:26,356
WE HAVE NO TIME.

821
01:26:26,388 --> 01:26:28,850
SHE'S SLIPPIN'.
WE GOTTA GET OFF THIS SHIP.

822
01:26:29,578 --> 01:26:30,880
HURRY!

823
01:26:31,055 --> 01:26:32,811
ELDON, HOW YOU DOIN'?

824
01:26:34,142 --> 01:26:35,936
I'M SCARED.

825
01:26:42,694 --> 01:26:46,406
WELL...IT'S A LOT SCARIER UP HERE WITHOUT US.
YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO ME!

826
01:26:47,407 --> 01:26:49,763
ELDON?
WE ALL GOTTA GET DOWN! STOP PUSHIN'.

827
01:26:49,802 --> 01:26:54,866
FOLLOW RIGHT BEHIND ME.
IF I COULD DO IT, ANYONE CAN.

828
01:27:08,683 --> 01:27:09,928
COME ON.

829
01:27:24,677 --> 01:27:26,677
HOLD ON, ELDON.

830
01:27:35,965 --> 01:27:38,593
TINY, TINY! HOLD ON.

831
01:28:35,661 --> 01:28:37,905
ELDON.

832
01:28:41,042 --> 01:28:43,837
ELDON, LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

833
01:28:56,227 --> 01:28:58,938
WHEN I JUMP SAY, LET GO.

834
01:29:06,514 --> 01:29:07,648
JUMP.

835
01:29:11,996 --> 01:29:13,264

836
01:29:15,366 --> 01:29:16,666
HOLD ON TIGHT.

837
01:29:22,133 --> 01:29:24,527
ALRIGHT! SO HEAVY, YOU CAN HARDLY STEER.

838
01:29:24,594 --> 01:29:27,547
THEY ARE SAYING THERE ARE
SEVEN OR EIGHT UP THERE ABOARD.

839
01:29:29,349 --> 01:29:34,731
MAYBE...WE TAKE THESE GUYS BACK IN...
COME BACK OUT.

840
01:29:43,074 --> 01:29:46,995
CAN'T LEAVE ANYBODY ALONE.
THAT BOAT WON'T LAST.

841
01:29:49,415 --> 01:29:51,459
WE ALL LIVE OR WE ALL DIE.

842
01:29:54,171 --> 01:29:55,372
RIGHT?

843
01:30:30,789 --> 01:30:32,750
YOU...AA..YOU DID GOOD.

844
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,721
YOU SHOULD BE LAST ONE OFF, MR.SYBERT.

845
01:31:35,248 --> 01:31:36,534
LAST MAN!

846
01:33:16,618 --> 01:33:20,332
HEY FITZ! TURN OFF THAT SEARCHLIGHT, YEAH?

847
01:33:45,402 --> 01:33:47,655
WE HAVE RADIO CONTACT WITH THE MCCULLOUGH.

848
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:53,120
I SAID THEY HAVE LOST FOUR MEN, BUT SAVED THE REST.
THE CAPTAIN OF THE POLLOCK RIP SAID...

849
01:33:53,287 --> 01:33:58,260
MR.CLUFF, IT IS 36500,
IT'S BERNIE...RIGHT ON THE RADIO!

850
01:33:58,327 --> 01:34:02,365
CHATHAM, CHATHAM, YOU COPY?

851
01:34:02,983 --> 01:34:07,763
CG-36500, THIS STATION CHATHAM.
WEBBER, IS THAT YOU?

852
01:34:07,929 --> 01:34:10,516
YES, SIR, IT'S ME, BERNIE.

853
01:34:11,927 --> 01:34:16,774
WE GOT 32 SURVIVORS ABOARD FROM THE PENDLETON, SIR.

854
01:34:17,783 --> 01:34:19,493
STATION CHATHAM, YOU COPY?

855
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:25,033
36500, STATION CHATHAM.
DID YOU SAY YOU HAVE 32 SURVIVORS ABOARD!?

856
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:29,747
THEY RESCUED 'EM! RESCUED 32 OF THEM.
YES SIR, 32...

857
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:33,276
WE LOST OUR COMPASS,
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE...

858
01:34:33,418 --> 01:34:35,220
BUT WE'LL TRY TO MAKE IT BACK HOME.

859
01:34:35,554 --> 01:34:37,881
CAN'T COME BACK WITHOUT A COMPASS.
NOT IN THIS WEATHER.

860
01:34:37,919 --> 01:34:39,220
THEY CAN NOT GO BACK.

861
01:34:40,426 --> 01:34:42,262
YOU LOST YOUR COMPASS WEBBER?

862
01:34:42,355 --> 01:34:46,775
NO. 36500, THIS IS THE POLLOCK LIGHTSHIP.
DO NOT PROCEED TO THE SHORE.

863
01:34:47,142 --> 01:34:50,563
WE'RE 5 MILES NORTHEAST OF LAST
LOCATION OF PENDLETON.

864
01:34:50,593 --> 01:34:54,765
PROCEED TO OUR POSITION, OVER.
CG-36500, STATION CHATHAM...

865
01:34:54,969 --> 01:34:59,224
PROCEED TO POLLOCK LIGHTSHIP
AND ONBOARD ALL SURVIVORS.

866
01:35:00,408 --> 01:35:02,035
WHAT DO THEY KNOW, RIGHT?

867
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:05,822
RIGHT, RICHIE?

868
01:35:06,874 --> 01:35:09,294
CG-36500, YOU COPY?

869
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:14,391
IF THEY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE...

870
01:35:15,134 --> 01:35:17,896
SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE I AM BECAUSE
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE HELL WE ARE.

871
01:35:17,922 --> 01:35:19,749
WEBBER, DO YOU COPY?

872
01:35:20,349 --> 01:35:25,321
I'M NOT GOING OUT TO SEA...NO.
THIS IS STATION CHATHAM, DO YOU COPY?

873
01:35:25,388 --> 01:35:30,911
WE JUST GOT YOU OFF A BOAT,
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GONNA GET YOU ALL UP THERE.

874
01:35:30,978 --> 01:35:33,598
CG-36500, THIS IS STATION CHATHAM.

875
01:35:33,765 --> 01:35:39,747
WEBBER, YOUR ORDERS ARE TO PROCEED 5 MILES NORTHEAST
AND ONBOARD ALL SURVIVORS AT THE POLLOCK.

876
01:35:55,015 --> 01:35:59,311
SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A CUT ON THE RADIO, MR.CLUFF.
HE'S GOING AT ON HIS OWN.

877
01:36:00,638 --> 01:36:01,889
BERNIE WEBBER.

878
01:36:03,558 --> 01:36:04,768
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

879
01:36:04,799 --> 01:36:06,301
HOW DO THEY GET HOME?

880
01:36:06,324 --> 01:36:08,017
HE TURNED OFF HIS RADIO.

881
01:36:10,567 --> 01:36:13,403
POOR GUYS! I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.

882
01:36:22,122 --> 01:36:23,590
THERE'S SOME MORE STUFF IN THE CAR.

883
01:36:30,515 --> 01:36:32,342
THE POWER WENT OUT.
HOW DO THEY GET HOME?

884
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:33,816
POWERS OUT.

885
01:36:34,928 --> 01:36:38,057
THE WHOLE TOWN! THE POWERS OUT.

886
01:36:39,275 --> 01:36:41,903
IT'S WORSE THAN LAST YEAR.
YOU NEVER KNOW.

887
01:37:00,258 --> 01:37:01,885
LET'S GET TO THE PIER.

888
01:37:12,325 --> 01:37:14,200
HOW DID YOU FIND US WITHOUT A COMPASS?

889
01:37:16,783 --> 01:37:20,992
WE...WE JODGED WITH SEASONAL CURRENTS.

890
01:37:25,575 --> 01:37:27,575
THINK WE JUST GOT LUCKY.

891
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:28,875
YEAH.

892
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,442
LUCKY.

893
01:37:37,075 --> 01:37:38,825
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET HOME?

894
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:42,408
TO BE HONEST WITH YA, I'M NOT SURE.

895
01:37:44,358 --> 01:37:50,325
JUST, DISOBEYED ALL MY RANKING OFFICERS.
THEY DON'T KNOW. SO I'M BETTER THAN 'EM, ALRIGHT?

896
01:37:51,075 --> 01:37:53,367
BUT THE WIND ON MY LEFT GOIN' OUT.

897
01:37:53,825 --> 01:37:59,575
EVEN IF I...KEEP IT ON THE RIGHT,
WE OUGHT TO BE THERE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

898
01:38:02,492 --> 01:38:06,200
WE JUST FOLLOW ALL THE LIGHTS ON THE SHORE.
FOLLOW THE LIGHTS ON THE SHORE.

899
01:38:19,492 --> 01:38:21,617
WELL, WE ARE IN YOUR HANDS, CAPTAIN.

900
01:38:31,575 --> 01:38:32,733
LISTEN UP.

901
01:38:36,992 --> 01:38:39,075
I PUT THE SEA BEHIND US.

902
01:38:41,033 --> 01:38:43,825
JUST LET IT PUSH US ALONG,
TILL WE LAND SOMEWHERE.

903
01:38:43,992 --> 01:38:49,367
STORM'S EASING' UP BOYS, SO..WE JUST LOOK
AT THE SHORE LIGHTS TO GUIDE US IN.

904
01:38:49,533 --> 01:38:55,533
EVEN IF WE HAVE TO GO SO FAR AS NOBSKA POINT.
SO BE IT! WE JUST GONNA FIND LAND!

905
01:39:00,075 --> 01:39:03,158
BEEN ONE HECK OF A LONG DAY, RIGHT FELLAS?

906
01:39:03,783 --> 01:39:06,908

907
01:39:08,992 --> 01:39:11,533
BUT DON'T YOU GIVE UP HOPE ON ME NOW.

908
01:39:13,742 --> 01:39:16,200
IT'S A GOOD BOAT.

909
01:39:18,617 --> 01:39:21,608
WILL GET YOU HOME, OKAY?
WE ARE ALL GOIN' HOME.

910
01:39:23,242 --> 01:39:24,908
WE ARE WITH YOU, SKIPPER.

911
01:42:49,575 --> 01:42:53,375
KEEP THE LIGHTS ON, LIKE SHE'S DOIN'.
TURN YOUR LIGHTS ON.

912
01:42:53,442 --> 01:42:56,700
TURN ON THE LIGHTS, EVERYONE.

913
01:42:57,367 --> 01:42:59,533
MORE LIGHT, SO THAT THEY CAN SEE US.

914
01:43:49,283 --> 01:43:51,575
I THINK WE MADE IT OVER THE BAR.

915
01:43:55,117 --> 01:43:57,442
THE THICK TIDE THERE IS OVER!

916
01:43:57,608 --> 01:44:00,525
YOU SEE THAT!?

917
01:44:22,617 --> 01:44:25,342
FITZ, TURN ON THE SEARCHLIGHT.

918
01:44:56,875 --> 01:45:01,088
LOOK, YOU SEE THAT?
THERE ARE OUR BOYS!

919
01:45:12,083 --> 01:45:13,333

01:45:18,283 --> 01:45:21,867
YOU DID IT, WEBBER!
WELL DONE, WEBBER!

922
01:45:22,742 --> 01:45:25,617
36500 CHATHAM DOCKING AT THE CHATHAM PIER.

923
01:45:25,783 --> 01:45:30,050
APPEAR TO BE 32 SURVIVORS, SIR.
I REPEAT: WE HAVE 32 SURVIVORS.

924
01:45:51,975 --> 01:45:53,542

01:46:06,617 --> 01:46:08,217
CMON! GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:46:08,283 --> 01:46:10,708
TAKE IT EASY!

928
01:46:11,575 --> 01:46:15,308
THIS MAN'S FREEZING. GIVE HIM A COAT.
GO ON IN, IT'S WARM INSIDE.

929
01:46:17,283 --> 01:46:18,783
LET'S GET YOU IN THE LODGE.

01:48:05,325 --> 01:48:06,833
LET'S GO.

936
01:48:40,167 --> 01:48:42,375

01:48:42,475 --> 01:48:43,975
YEAH...

938
01:48:45,733 --> 01:48:47,575
I ASKED CLUFF FOR YOU.

939
01:48:49,175 --> 01:48:51,442
HE SAID IT'S JUST A...
FORMALITY.

940
01:48:53,317 --> 01:48:55,042
