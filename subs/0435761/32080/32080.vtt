(Entourage)

3
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:07,081
What's this?

4
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:11,181
Are you hitting on me? I'll pass.

5
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:15,881
I was just admiring your skateboarding skills.

6
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:17,421
So?

7
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:20,081
I thought I'd befriend you and learn a few tricks.

8
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,981
I'm good. There are plenty of good people other than me.

9
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:26,351
I know. Goodness.

10
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:48,221
You're here.

11
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:57,281
You can speak.

12
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:01,721
Why exactly are you doing this?

13
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:03,481
You bailed out once, remember?

14
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:06,551
On what? Investing in "Lim Hwa Su"?

15
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:08,751
It's a good movie.

16
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:12,181
- That's not the real reason. - What do you want to hear?

17
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:14,781
Aren't you trying to cut Young Bin out of the movie?

18
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:17,521
No way.

19
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:20,751
Let's be honest, Ms. Jo.

20
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:25,821
I started my cinematic career in advertising and marketing.

21
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:28,551
Do you know who gave me the hardest time when I was in marketing?

22
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:32,581
- Your ex-husband? - I've never been married.

23
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:35,581
I see. Why is there a rumor saying you got divorced twice?

24
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:37,351
- The actors. - Right.

25
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,881
There were also stuck-up producers, delusional directors,

26
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:43,551
and arrogant reporters.

27
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:45,621
But actors were the worst.

28
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:48,451
There are some actors who give you hard time.

29
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:51,521
I had to treat them like kings in order to promote movies.

30
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:53,651
It's funny, isn't it? It's their movie, after all.

31
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,221
When I was in their faces, I smiled for them.

32
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:59,281
Meanwhile, my insides were being burnt down.

33
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:02,351
There are many people who hold grudges in this industry.

34
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:04,021
And then what?

35
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:06,151
He bailed out on my movie without consulting anyone.

36
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:08,621
That reminded me of the old days.

37
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:11,651
I'm sick of the actors' irresponsibility.

38
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:13,881
That's why I got you a new actor.

39
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:16,521
Let's stop it now. I'm sick of it.

40
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:18,781
That's right. I'm sick of it, too.

41
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:22,721
I'm not a bad person. I'm not small-minded, either.

42
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:27,051
We're only investing in the movie because it's a good film.

43
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:28,981
Right.

44
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:31,451
I see. So Young Bin should...

45
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:34,321
No. I can't trust him.

46
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:37,221
Gosh.

47
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:40,051
Goodness.

48
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:46,821
Hey, Boss. You're here.

49
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:48,691
What are you so happy about?

50
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:51,191
I'm happy to see Young Bin.

51
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:52,721
Should I not be smiling?

52
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:56,051
What? What is it?

53
00:03:57,281 --> 00:04:00,281
Did you have a fight again?

54
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:04,551
When you get angry, your face gets really wrinkly.

55
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:07,281
What is a llama talking to me about?

56
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:09,381
Llamas are cute.

57
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:13,221
Why you little...

58
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:23,151
Why didn't you say you were coming?

59
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:25,191
I was curious how things are going with "Lim Hwa Su".

60
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:27,981
You never tell me the bad news.

61
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,981
No. I don't do that these days.

62
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:32,481
What did Ms. Jo say?

63
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:36,321
It must be bad since you're pretending to be bright.

64
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,721
You know me better than my wife does.

65
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:46,651
She doesn't like you. She never did.

66
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,481
Do you think it'll work out if I go apologize to her?

67
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:53,951
You're going to meet her?

68
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,181
I can't do the movie like this so I have to do something.

69
00:04:56,721 --> 00:05:00,251
She doesn't even want to meet you.

70
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,321
What about the production company?

71
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:04,751
They don't have any say in it. They're the ones who get paid.

72
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,221
Mr. Ahn has completely given up.

73
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:09,321
What about Director Yang?

74
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:12,221
He's not the type to be easily persuaded by the investors.

75
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,921
He's a new director.

76
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,551
Today's movie industry revolves around the investors.

77
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:21,021
Things just won't work out with Ms. Jo.

78
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:25,851
She says that she's in it because "Lim Hwa Su" is of good quality,

79
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,721
but she's trying to mess with Young Bin.

80
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:31,621
I shouldn't have quit in the first place.

81
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:34,481
Investing in a movie...

82
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:37,521
just to kick an actor out isn't right. She crossed the line.

83
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:40,681
It can't be solely because of that. The movie is of good quality.

84
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:46,051
Let's forget about this movie. We should look for something else.

85
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:47,451
I don't want to do anything other than "Lim Hwa Su".

86
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:51,221
There he goes again. You're being stubborn.

87
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:53,781
"Lim Hwa Su" is out of the picture now.

88
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:56,681
You know how Ms. Jo can get.

89
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:00,221
I know, but I have to persuade her. I'll ask for forgiveness.

90
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:01,881
You want to do the movie that much?

91
00:06:01,981 --> 00:06:04,181
Yes. I really want to do it.

92
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:05,751
Okay.

93
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:09,181
I'll make sure you get to meet her.

94
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:13,021
Maybe she'll listen to me when I say you'll apologize to her.

95
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:16,751
However, if that doesn't work, you have to do something else.

96
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,951
We have to persuade her. I'll beg for her forgiveness.

97
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:22,021
Gosh. Fine, then.

98
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,021
Let's bring it in.

99
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,021
What are you doing?

100
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:32,181
You're being so weird. Why don't you just curse?

101
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:34,181
- I'll say. - I thought it was weird, too.

102
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:38,181
Was it that much to ask for?

103
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:41,881
- One, two, three. Let's go! - Let's go!

104
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,181
Gosh.

105
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:47,721
- Hello. - Hello.

106
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:49,551
Thank you.

107
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:53,121
Why do you keep tagging me along?

108
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:55,751
People make fun of me because of what happened last time.

109
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:57,381
You don't do anything at home.

110
00:06:57,481 --> 00:07:00,251
- I make business plans. - Of course you do.

111
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:03,921
- Don't you want to do anything? - No.

112
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:05,981
Joon, people with dreams are hard to find.

113
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:09,051
- Having a job can't be a dream. - Forget it.

114
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,921
Where's my manager?

115
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:12,681
He should be here somewhere.

116
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:15,521
Why do you feel uncomfortable around him? He's even younger than me.

117
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:17,421
You don't treat me like that.

118
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:21,451
You make it sound like I find my manager uncomfortable.

119
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,121
Yes. You look like it.

120
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:30,721
I'll go get the car. Please come to the parking lot.

121
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,181
- Let's go. - Okay.

122
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:35,881
I can do... Thank you so much.

123
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,721
"I can do... Thank you so much."

124
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:42,421
Cha Joon is a coward who is weak to the strong and strong to the weak.

125
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:45,451
What did you say? Watch your mouth.

126
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:48,281
Hey, Cha Joon.

127
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:51,051
That's Lee Joo Yeon.

128
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:54,321
Long time no see. How have you been?

129
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:57,521
Can you stop hitting me? You should really work on that.

130
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,951
I was happy to see you, that's all.

131
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:01,981
Are you shooting here today?

132
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:04,681
Horse Lady Cha Joon was hilarious.

133
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:05,921
Mr. Prostate.

134
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:09,251
What brings you here?

135
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,181
I started doing a drama, too.

136
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:13,981
- By the way, who's this? - Don't mind him.

137
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:16,291
- Good luck on your drama. - Thanks.

138
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:17,421
See you next time.

139
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:26,151
That's Lee Joo Yeon. How do you know her?

140
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:28,791
- You looked really close. - We were in the same agency.

141
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:30,621
Oh, that's right.

142
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:32,921
What's wrong, then? You looked like you didn't like her.

143
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:36,651
The agency backed up her girl group and neglected us completely.

144
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:37,981
That's why we didn't make it.

145
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:40,251
That's because you guys were unpopular.

146
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,321
The CEO didn't treat us fairly.

147
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,321
Only they got good housing.

148
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:46,291
We were given 5 dollars a meal and they were given 10 each.

149
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:50,521
Whenever we came across each other, she ignored me. That arrogant brat.

150
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:53,451
That's all past you now. She came to say hi to you just now.

151
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:56,521
Now, there are people watching us.

152
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:58,751
She probably still thinks ill of me.

153
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:01,651
You're the only one who thinks that. Stop with that victim mentality.

154
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:04,751
Let's go. My manager is waiting.

155
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,021
We should. If we don't, he'll probably beat us up.

156
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:08,321
Oh, my gosh.

157
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,081
Young Bin!

158
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:20,081
- Are you in there? - Come out of there.

159
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:21,821
- Hi. - Come on out.

160
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:24,181
- Get out of my way. - Oh, gosh.

161
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:26,851
- Let go of me. - What are you doing?

162
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:29,021
Let go of me.

163
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:33,451
That's not Young Bin.

164
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:35,681
It's him. You know,

165
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,321
the guy with a penis problem.

166
00:09:37,821 --> 00:09:40,021
- That's him? - Let's go, guys.

167
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:42,251
Guys?

168
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:51,791
- I'll go now. - Okay, thank you.

169
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:54,651
Have a... Thanks for everything.

170
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:58,751
What was that?

171
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:08,021
What did they just say?

172
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:11,851
They were expecting Young Bin and were surprised to see you.

173
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,721
This is stressful.

174
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:15,951
I have an upset stomach now.

175
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:18,521
Can you get me something for it from the convenience store?

176
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:21,291
- You go. - People recognize me.

177
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:24,451
You think you're a big star now?

178
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:28,081
When will you wake up? You need therapy.

179
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:30,051
I am a star.

180
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:44,751
- Aren't you the guy from Han River? - You're the girl on the skateboard.

181
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:52,751
That man who was with you that day is Cha Young Bin, right?

182
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:55,651
That's right. Why?

183
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:58,521
Darn it. I should've taken a picture and asked for an autograph.

184
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,621
Why are you friends with Young Bin?

185
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:02,381
I mean... Are you two really close?

186
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:04,151
We get by.

187
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:07,451
So you're not that close? Don't you have his number?

188
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:10,121
We're not that close.

189
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:12,821
Why? What are you doing here?

190
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:15,081
I want to see Cha Young Bin.

191
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:19,581
I went there that day because I heard he comes to Han River often.

192
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,451
I was just asking. That's too bad.

193
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:27,251
The fans are standing over there. Why aren't you there with them?

194
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:30,381
I'm not going near them. Do you know how scary they can be?

195
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:31,521
They're groupies.

196
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:33,351
And you're not?

197
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:34,981
I just want to see him once and for all.

198
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:37,521
I'm not lying.

199
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,981
That means you're a groupie.

200
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:42,881
What's that?

201
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:45,151
That's for the street cat.

202
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:47,951
It's hiding around here somewhere. It's really cute.

203
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:52,681
Feed away.

204
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,521
Pet it.

205
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,081
- Okay. I will. - I'll go now.

206
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:57,851
- Go on, then. - I was on my way.

207
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,751
- I'm leaving. - Okay, then.

208
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:03,221
I'm going now.

209
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:06,581
- What kind of tuna is that? - Get out of here.

210
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:28,951
Hey.

211
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:30,551
She's so cute.

212
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:33,751
The groupies made a camp by the convenience store.

213
00:12:34,281 --> 00:12:35,951
I hope they don't ring the bell late at night.

214
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:38,681
They gave me an upset stomach.

215
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:40,781
It got worse when I heard you didn't get a part in that movie.

216
00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:42,851
That woman rejected Young Bin again?

217
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:49,151
If Young Bin doesn't get the part, I won't get one, either.

218
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,951
You'll be able to do it. Director Yang will give you one.

219
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:55,121
It's an ill-fated relationship we have with Ms. Jo.

220
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:00,121
It's because of what happened at Busan International Film Festival.

221
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:01,521
That time when she groped your bottom...

222
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:03,251
Let me talk to your bottom.

223
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:06,481
Hey. Do you want to die?

224
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:08,821
Why do you have to be there, Idiot?

225
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,521
Why did you get groped, Stupid?

226
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,481
This is all your fault, Dummy.

227
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:14,421
Are you talking to me or my bottom?

228
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:16,421
Your bottom.

229
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:19,451
You old, ugly bottom.

230
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:22,581
Get a grip, you pooping machine.

231
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:24,351
Gosh.

232
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:28,081
Why can I laugh in this type of situation?

233
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:30,281
You only live once.

234
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:33,081
Let's not get too serious.

235
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:35,421
You're right. It'll all work out.

236
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:39,121
Darn bottom. I'm talking to your bottom.

237
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:41,351
- That's enough now. - I'm talking to your bottom.

238
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:43,951
You didn't do anything wrong. It's your bottom's fault.

239
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:46,481
Oh Dal Su invited me to his movie premier.

240
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:52,151
I can't go to someone else's movie premier in a situation like this.

241
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:53,621
Hold on.

242
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,181
Isn't that the movie Ms. Jo invested in?

243
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:00,651
That's the one.

244
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:04,181
Let's go.

245
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:06,451
Young Bin.

246
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,751
He's doing all this on purpose, isn't he?

247
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:24,081
This won't change Ms. Jo's mind.

248
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:26,151
I'm getting offers from everywhere even now.

249
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:29,421
I think it'll be better if we don't mention other movies.

250
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:30,851
You know how stubborn he is.

251
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,721
I do very well.

252
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:34,481
He did it to me, too.

253
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,481
Thank you.

254
00:14:38,721 --> 00:14:40,381
Thank you.

255
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:43,621
Were you talking about me?

256
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,451
Yes. We talked behind your back.

257
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:48,281
Ms. Jo is the one we want to talk behind her back. Where is she?

258
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,551
I don't know. We should go see her.

259
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:54,481
There's Oh Dal Su.

260
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:56,781
Just look at how big his head is.

261
00:14:57,181 --> 00:14:59,551
I feel so much better when I'm standing next to him.

262
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:01,951
Dal Su.

263
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,251
- Hello. - Hello.

264
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:04,751
Hey, Kim Eun Gab.

265
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:07,651
You were talking about my head again, weren't you?

266
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:09,351
You really stand out.

267
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:12,221
- Hey, Young Bin. - Hello.

268
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:15,151
- We should do a movie together. - Of course.

269
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,951
You really should.

270
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:18,781
We want to sell 10 million tickets with you as a lucky charm.

271
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:21,651
- Is your head the secret behind it? - Stop talking nonsense.

272
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:23,451
I'm a bit busy right now. Sorry.

273
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:25,981
- Enjoy the movie. - We will. Congratulations.

274
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,681
You should drink coffee.

275
00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:29,421
- Okay. - Thank you.

276
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:30,621
- Don't drink too much. - All right.

277
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,781
Stay healthy. Don't get sick and live happily.

278
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:41,081
That movie was so bad.

279
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:43,951
I feel like I took a sleeping pill.

280
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:46,051
Why did you have to snore?

281
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:49,251
Was I not cursing? Even religious television is better than this.

282
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,251
It really was painful to watch it until the end.

283
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:52,721
I know, right? I'm worried for him.

284
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:55,151
Did you get the ending?

285
00:15:55,451 --> 00:15:56,821
No.

286
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:00,581
Cha Young Bin. Can you tell us what you thought about the movie?

287
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:02,551
- Okay. - Let's get started.

288
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:04,251
How did you like the movie?

289
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,121
It was really good. I liked it.

290
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:07,781
It was of good quality.

291
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:11,351
The directing and acting were spotless.

292
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:13,351
I'll recommend people around me to go watch this movie.

293
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:17,421
- Is that good enough? - Thank you.

294
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:19,121
- Okay. - Thank you.

295
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,151
Thank you.

296
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,321
You're so pretentious.

297
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:26,521
You were right. Actors are not to be trusted.

298
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:28,281
I hope Ms. Jo sees that.

299
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:31,651
The thumbs up was too much.

300
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:33,451
- That was... - Stop it now.

301
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:38,121
It's Ms. Jo. Let's go talk to her.

302
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,121
Ms. Jo.

303
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:47,351
Is she ignoring me on purpose?

304
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:52,621
Why isn't she...

305
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:01,051
Ms. Jo.

306
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:06,151
Come on. Hurry.

307
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:07,281
Excuse me.

308
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:09,451
- Ms. Jo. - Hey!

309
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,991
She took off on us.

310
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:15,551
Does she think we're stalkers?

311
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:18,991
- It's Ms. Kang. - Is it her?

312
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:23,321
- Why are you avoiding her? - Why are you?

313
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:26,451
We didn't do anything wrong.

314
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:27,681
Ji An is here, too.

315
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:29,081
- You know Ji An? - No.

316
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:32,021
- Who's that? - Should we go now?

317
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:33,081
Let's go somewhere.

318
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:36,381
There's no need for us to be shameful.

319
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:38,521
Just be yourself.

320
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:41,221
She's coming. Press the button.

321
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:43,821
Face the restroom.

322
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:54,021
You three make a good company.

323
00:17:54,351 --> 00:17:55,781
It's nice.

324
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:58,151
You're here for the movie premier, too?

325
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:03,521
- Hello, Mr. Kim. - Long time no see, Ji An.

326
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,721
- Hello, you two. - Hello.

327
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,621
What a boring movie.

328
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:12,651
What a lame day this is.

329
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:15,181
First the movie, and now this.

330
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:17,021
Mom.

331
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:19,621
- Aren't you coming? - We're expecting company.

332
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:20,851
Go on up.

333
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:23,121
Of course, you are.

334
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:25,151
Are you expecting ghosts?

335
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:27,991
You certainly feel like one. Go on up.

336
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:32,051
Right. I wish you a long and happy life, too.

337
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:36,081
Call me.

338
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:38,581
What was that?

339
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,551
- What was that just now? - Nothing.

340
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,721
She's so strange. Why would she...

341
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,751
What's wrong with her?

342
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,551
- Is something going on? - No.

343
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:50,651
She's fierce just like her mother. Get yourself together.

344
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:53,381
Why isn't the elevator coming down?

345
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:54,651
Why would she do that?

346
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:58,351
You looked like you were avoiding me on purpose.

347
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:00,421
Why would I? I didn't see you.

348
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:03,321
You saw me after the premier.

349
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:04,951
We were chasing you down.

350
00:19:05,621 --> 00:19:08,221
- I said I didn't see you. - Fine. I understand.

351
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,521
Young Bin was there yesterday.

352
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:13,681
He did an interview promoting the movie.

353
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:14,821
So?

354
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:18,221
He's doing it on purpose because he feels sorry to you.

355
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:20,721
There's no need for that. It's over between us.

356
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:22,721
How is it over?

357
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:25,451
Even with a couple breaks up, they meet once for the last time.

358
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:27,421
Are you...

359
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:29,951
looking into the casting for "Lim Hwa Su"?

360
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:31,281
Yes, of course.

361
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:34,721
I've been looking into it as well, but there wasn't anyone available.

362
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:35,881
You couldn't find anyone, could you?

363
00:19:36,251 --> 00:19:39,491
Song Joong Ki, Lee Min Ho, Kim Soo Hyun are all busy.

364
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,251
It's an on-going process.

365
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:45,821
Ms. Jo. Can you at least see Young Bin for one last time?

366
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:49,051
What's so hard about that? Don't bring emotions to business.

367
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:50,581
You know better than that.

368
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:52,751
He was the one who got emotional first.

369
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:56,121
Please. Give him one meeting.

370
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,951
If you do that,

371
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,781
ask me for any favor and I'll deliver.

372
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:02,021
Is that right?

373
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:04,751
Lee El is with you, right?

374
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:07,351
That's right. She's part of our agency.

375
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:11,491
I'm doing a new movie soon. I want her on it.

376
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:12,751
Do that for me.

377
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:16,951
Then I'll think about it.

378
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,451
Stop reading and start talking.

379
00:20:27,251 --> 00:20:28,491
What do you think?

380
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:34,051
I think it could work.

381
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,151
The investors like throwing away their money.

382
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:38,651
To be honest,

383
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:40,781
I wouldn't invest in something like this.

384
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:42,991
I don't really like the script, either.

385
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:45,451
And the female role has such a small part.

386
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:48,621
This is what she gave to Lee El.

387
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:50,821
She's going to play such a petty role.

388
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:54,851
We're making a deal, right?

389
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,421
We are.

390
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:00,491
If we give her Lee El, she'll think positively about Young Bin.

391
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:02,181
It's a good deal for her.

392
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:05,951
She doesn't want a rookie, but a top actress wouldn't be willing.

393
00:21:05,991 --> 00:21:09,181
She's going to get what she wants.

394
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:14,551
If Lee El does this,

395
00:21:15,451 --> 00:21:17,221
will she let Young Bin do "Lim Hwa Su"?

396
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:21,551
If she has a conscience, she'll at least meet him.

397
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:23,781
She probably will.

398
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:25,081
- Right. - By the way,

399
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:28,781
we're almost handing over Lee El at the wholesale price.

400
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:32,121
This thing we're doing...

401
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:34,321
- I know. - This isn't our style.

402
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:36,921
This isn't the way we do things.

403
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:38,221
Gosh, you scared me.

404
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:41,481
You scared me to death.

405
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:43,451
What's the special occasion? You're never on time.

406
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:46,021
I made him wait for too long the other day.

407
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:49,221
Do you want to have a meal with me? I'm feeling hungry.

408
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:52,551
Okay. Let's do that.

409
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:57,681
Why didn't she ask me?

410
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:01,181
How are we going to do this?

411
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,881
Are you going to make her do this?

412
00:22:07,221 --> 00:22:10,181
We could pretend to answer to her demands...

413
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:13,421
and get Young Bin a meeting for "Lim Hwa Su" first.

414
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:15,821
You're good at things like that, right?

415
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:22,421
That's what I was going to do, but I don't like it coming from you.

416
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:25,551
Well, you're the expert.

417
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:30,081
I'll just inform her that there's an opening.

418
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:31,821
Okay.

419
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:34,281
Go now.

420
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:43,151
Is he becoming more like me or what?

421
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:45,121
Where was I?

422
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:55,551
That's not it.

423
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:57,381
How's it coming along?

424
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:01,281
I don't remember anything. I should look it up.

425
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:04,081
Why do you want me to do Sugar Boys dance?

426
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:07,321
I think it'll be funny. Going old-school is the trend.

427
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:09,021
I guess so.

428
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:18,921
What are you doing here?

429
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:20,221
I came to see you.

430
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:23,051
- You still can't dance, can you? - It's Lee Joo Yeon.

431
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:26,051
You were the worst dancer in your group.

432
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:28,551
What are you talking about? I was the lead dancer.

433
00:23:28,651 --> 00:23:30,121
You should go now. I have to practice.

434
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:31,721
I was about to.

435
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:33,881
By the way,

436
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,221
what are you doing this evening?

437
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:38,021
I'll be home.

438
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:41,581
I'm going to meditate and study humanism.

439
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:43,521
I'm free tonight.

440
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:45,821
I'm finally having a day off.

441
00:23:47,351 --> 00:23:48,881
Do you want to have dinner with me?

442
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:50,951
I told you. I have to meditate and...

443
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:55,781
Are you going to take me somewhere fancy?

444
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:57,281
Of course.

445
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:03,921
You don't have a date with your girlfriend, do you?

446
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:06,181
A girlfriend? I don't have one.

447
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:09,221
I'll give you a call later.

448
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:12,581
- But you don't have my number. - Yes, I do.

449
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:20,051
Joon, are you friends with Lee Joo Yeon?

450
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:22,751
Not at all. I don't know why she's acting friendly all of a sudden.

451
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:25,221
Maybe she likes you.

452
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:28,021
What? Don't be ridiculous.

453
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:29,751
I'm probably the last person she cares about.

454
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:34,181
She used to look down on me in the old days.

455
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:37,251
That's true. There's no way Lee Joo Yeon is into you.

456
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:43,621
So why is she acting friendly? Does she have a favor to ask?

457
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:46,621
Is it because of Young Bin?

458
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:26,321
- Ms. Skateboard? - My name is Min Ah.

459
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:28,621
I wasn't asking.

460
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:34,181
Did you not come with Young Bin today?

461
00:25:34,521 --> 00:25:35,751
I came alone. Why?

462
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:39,021
I've been waiting since morning. That's too bad.

463
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:41,581
Since morning? Don't you work? Don't you go to school?

464
00:25:41,851 --> 00:25:42,921
I'm a student on leave.

465
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:45,121
So that's why you're out here every day.

466
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:49,081
What do you do, Mister? Are you unemployed?

467
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:51,851
I'm not "Mister", but I am unemployed.

468
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,421
No wonder I always see you around.

469
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:02,821
What's wrong?

470
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:04,821
I'm hungry.

471
00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:21,821
I mean...

472
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:24,951
What are you doing in Seoul if you live in Daejeon? Did you run away?

473
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:27,951
I'm a grown-up.

474
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:29,881
I just left.

475
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:33,951
I was sick of working part-time and the nagging from my parents.

476
00:26:34,951 --> 00:26:36,081
I hate my life.

477
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:39,421
- So you did run away from home. - I'm on a trip.

478
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:43,351
Thanks for the food.

479
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:46,521
I can buy you food,

480
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,721
but why did you have to get the most expensive lunch box?

481
00:26:50,621 --> 00:26:51,951
That's why I'm thanking you.

482
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:56,751
I sleep in my friend's dorm room,

483
00:26:57,551 --> 00:26:59,881
but I ran out of money to buy food.

484
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,121
Then go home. Or you could go back to school.

485
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,321
The tuition is so expensive, though.

486
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:07,451
It's not like there's a guarantee I'll get a job after I graduate.

487
00:27:08,381 --> 00:27:09,381
Don't you have anything that you want to do?

488
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:16,051
I don't know. I'd like to win the lottery.

489
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:18,551
Gosh.

490
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:23,181
Do you think I'm pathetic?

491
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:26,281
No. It's just that you're so much like me.

492
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:28,521
We're both freeloaders, unemployed, and hopeless.

493
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,381
That makes us buddies.

494
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:32,051
Right.

495
00:27:35,051 --> 00:27:37,281
What's that alarm for? Do you have an appointment?

496
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:40,651
No, I set the alarm for a cartoon show, "Adventure Time".

497
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,951
That's my favorite show.

498
00:27:43,421 --> 00:27:45,851
- Jack the dog - Finn the human

499
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:49,851
Do you watch "K-On!"?

500
00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:52,751
I've seen up until season 2. I've seen the movie, too.

501
00:27:52,851 --> 00:27:54,821
You're a nerd.

502
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:57,551
Right. Is that bad?

503
00:27:57,751 --> 00:28:00,721
No, not all the time.

504
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:09,481
Hello? Hey, Joon.

505
00:28:09,781 --> 00:28:12,151
- Let's eat outside tonight. - What are you talking about?

506
00:28:12,621 --> 00:28:14,521
Joo Yeon says she wants to buy me dinner.

507
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:15,851
Then have dinner with her.

508
00:28:15,881 --> 00:28:17,751
Why would I want to have dinner alone with her?

509
00:28:18,221 --> 00:28:20,421
I'll order everything and make her pay a big bill.

510
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:24,181
What's wrong with you? You're so childish.

511
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:27,121
Fine, I'll come.

512
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:29,081
I promise. Bye.

513
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:34,521
Are you going somewhere? Are you going to see Cha Young Bin?

514
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:39,451
He's a Cha, too. But he's a different Cha.

515
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:44,051
- He wants to have dinner together. - Can I tag along?

516
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:47,421
We're not that close. Let's not cross the line here.

517
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:48,821
What's the problem?

518
00:28:49,821 --> 00:28:50,951
You're just like me.

519
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:54,781
- Can I go? - How are you so much like me?

520
00:28:55,451 --> 00:28:56,481
Let's go.

521
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:58,521
(Dry-aged Korean Beef)

522
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:08,821
Are you two refugees or something?

523
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:10,881
Don't be like that.

524
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:12,951
Enjoy.

525
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:15,751
How long have you two been dating?

526
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:19,121
- We're just... - We're not dating.

527
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:21,051
I'm just pretending to be his friend.

528
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:25,621
Why did you pretend like you're not close with Cha Young Bin?

529
00:29:26,051 --> 00:29:27,881
You're so close to his cousin.

530
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:30,821
He said that? We all live together.

531
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:32,751
- Why would you say that? - Really?

532
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:34,021
That's amazing.

533
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:38,351
- He looks handsome all of a sudden. - I see.

534
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:41,421
Your friends are all celebrities.

535
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:44,951
You even eat with Lee Joo Yeon. I'm jealous.

536
00:29:45,021 --> 00:29:47,581
Enough with that. Just be quiet and eat.

537
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:48,821
Okay.

538
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,481
By the way, why aren't the two of you talking?

539
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,051
Are we interrupting your date?

540
00:29:53,151 --> 00:29:55,621
It's not a date. We're just having some barbecue.

541
00:29:56,481 --> 00:29:58,521
Why did you ask me out? Do you have a favor to ask?

542
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:00,321
No.

543
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:03,851
By the way, didn't you say you go to church?

544
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:06,151
You remember that?

545
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:10,621
My manager then took me with him. I only went a few times.

546
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:12,521
Do you want to join our prayer group?

547
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:14,381
Are there female celebrities? I'm in.

548
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:16,021
- Same with me. - Get lost.

549
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:21,881
Here.

550
00:30:22,381 --> 00:30:24,981
It's okay. I'll eat by myself. You're going to play a prank.

551
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:27,281
You're so suspicious of everything.

552
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:29,851
You should eat a lot.

553
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:32,551
I'll order some more on my way to the washroom.

554
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:42,951
What?

555
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:45,181
Joon, I noticed something surprising.

556
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:46,921
I think she's interested in you.

557
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:48,651
Don't even joke.

558
00:30:49,051 --> 00:30:51,051
She's acting nice because you guys are here.

559
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:53,621
You're so slow.

560
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:55,821
- You never had a girlfriend, right? - How did you know?

561
00:30:56,681 --> 00:30:59,181
Don't act like you're the jack of all trades at dating.

562
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:02,951
"Jack of all trades"? You sound so old.

563
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:05,521
I have goosebumps. How do you talk like that?

564
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:08,951
Hey. Stop eating.

565
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:10,481
Who is she? Is she your mini me?

566
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:12,451
You're both making me mad.

567
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:14,421
You should get together with Joo Yeon.

568
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:16,051
You can go to church together.

569
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:17,951
What about going to church?

570
00:31:18,051 --> 00:31:19,581
It's not like a summer camp!

571
00:31:20,721 --> 00:31:22,721
My mouth hurts. I better eat.

572
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,521
Just let him be and eat some meat.

573
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:27,251
You have no idea what she's like.

574
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:31,181
She even went to the police station for having a fight on the streets.

575
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,551
She's a scary person.

576
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,221
She's so scary.

577
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:40,921
Fool?

578
00:31:41,851 --> 00:31:42,951
I didn't say anything.

579
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:45,521
You heard something, right? I heard something similar to it.

580
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:47,621
You two are the same.

581
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:52,751
Could I get your autograph?

582
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,081
- I want to post it up. - Sure.

583
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:59,081
- Let's do it together. - What? Autograph? Sure.

584
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:04,181
I'm sorry, but I only want autographs of celebrities.

585
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:05,821
Who is he?

586
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:12,821
I'm so full.

587
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:17,851
Where is the car?

588
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:21,121
Are you going to leave without saying bye to Joo Yeon?

589
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,521
Didn't you just see? She asked me to sign it to embarrass me.

590
00:32:26,181 --> 00:32:27,621
You have a victim mentality.

591
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:29,051
Be quiet.

592
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,051
Where is the car?

593
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:36,451
I better go.

594
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:38,251
Thank you for the food.

595
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:40,181
It's not like I paid for it.

596
00:32:41,051 --> 00:32:42,621
- Are you going back home? - Yes.

597
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:44,551
Can I call you?

598
00:32:44,621 --> 00:32:46,721
No. You can follow me on social media.

599
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:48,151
I'll call you.

600
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:56,521
- Hey. - What?

601
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,421
I think you're a good person.

602
00:33:00,851 --> 00:33:01,851
You too.

603
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:11,151
Are you inside?

604
00:33:11,851 --> 00:33:12,851
Yes.

605
00:33:15,581 --> 00:33:16,591
Are you here?

606
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:19,981
Yes. What are you doing?

607
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:22,281
Trying to find myself a job.

608
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:25,851
- What is it? - "Lim Hwa Su" character history.

609
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:27,151
I'm trying to write it down.

610
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,951
It's so unlike you.

611
00:33:33,351 --> 00:33:34,551
What have you figured out?

612
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,751
My conclusion is that the man has an addiction to violence.

613
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:41,781
He's controlled by his obsessions which is a result of his childhood.

614
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:44,251
No one had money to eat during that time.

615
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:46,521
Did you even look up books?

616
00:33:46,951 --> 00:33:47,951
There isn't much on it.

617
00:33:48,721 --> 00:33:50,151
It comes out a little bit in the drama.

618
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:51,521
The director will be happy.

619
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:54,681
I'm doing it because I enjoy it.

620
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:59,181
Did you talk to Ms. Jo?

621
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:05,621
- It's such a headache. - Should I call her first?

622
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:08,091
- You? - Yes.

623
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:11,651
I made the mess, and the two of you are cleaning it all up.

624
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:13,951
It might be best for me to call her.

625
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:15,451
No, she'll be even more mad.

626
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:17,981
- What should we do, then? - Just wait.

627
00:34:17,981 --> 00:34:19,981
Mr. Kim and I are trying.

628
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:23,281
Sitting and waiting is so difficult.

629
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:26,021
Just hang in there.

630
00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:31,591
Hey, Joon is doing his old dance. Come and see. It's hilarious.

631
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,381
Dance?

632
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:38,051
How can you call that a dance?

633
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:40,981
It's a popular dance move in Europe.

634
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:46,121
- Mr. Kim. - Yes, what is it?

635
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:47,421
One moment.

636
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:53,921
Mr. Kim...

637
00:34:56,821 --> 00:34:58,121
Are you doing something right now?

638
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:00,681
I'm doing my daughter's art homework.

639
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:02,651
She's busy with extra classes and asked me.

640
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:05,721
I see. I don't know what to say.

641
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:08,321
What would you know? You don't have a daughter.

642
00:35:08,821 --> 00:35:09,951
You're not married, either.

643
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:14,281
Also, why didn't you tell me about Ji An? Do you want to die?

644
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:17,381
I told you, I didn't have a chance.

645
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:19,381
We were separated for a while.

646
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:22,851
Right. Come to think of it,

647
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,621
were you trying to take Young Bin...

648
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:27,121
back to Ok Ja because of Ji An?

649
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:29,151
We never went.

650
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:31,821
Are you a double spy? Are you recording this call?

651
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,221
Mr. Kim, it's about Young Bin.

652
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:38,151
What about him?

653
00:35:38,421 --> 00:35:40,881
He's begging to see Ms. Jo.

654
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,751
He wants to call her and set up a meeting.

655
00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:45,481
Well...

656
00:35:46,451 --> 00:35:48,921
She won't see him even if he does.

657
00:35:49,221 --> 00:35:51,051
I tried to stop him but...

658
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,651
Mr. Kim.

659
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:56,221
I'm thinking about...

660
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:59,751
letting Lee El appear in Ms. Jo's film.

661
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:04,351
It's not a bad film, and she'd be the female lead.

662
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:06,881
Ask yourself in all honesty.

663
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:10,981
Are you trying to sell her away for Young Bin?

664
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:13,921
Yes. I think it'd be the right move to let her star in it.

665
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:17,681
Are you telling yourself that or are you really okay?

666
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:19,781
She's your star, too.

667
00:36:20,051 --> 00:36:22,621
You should treat her like your daughter and a princess.

668
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,181
She's your talent.

669
00:36:24,621 --> 00:36:25,621
I'm well aware of that.

670
00:36:27,021 --> 00:36:28,651
Are you or are you not?

671
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:30,981
You don't care about anything else except for Young Bin, do you?

672
00:36:31,751 --> 00:36:34,221
Fine. We'll talk at the office.

673
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,151
Okay.

674
00:36:40,091 --> 00:36:42,181
Let's see. The nose...

675
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:46,591
That's good enough, right?

676
00:36:48,981 --> 00:36:51,681
It's good enough, right?

677
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:55,681
It's really bad.

678
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,251
This is what a kid in second grade would draw.

679
00:36:59,621 --> 00:37:02,251
If you say things like that, you're going to upset me.

680
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:04,721
Yes. I think your dad is cute for drawing this.

681
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:09,651
Your mom is more beautiful, of course.

682
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:12,381
If you asked me...

683
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:16,151
to draw her figure, I'd do better since I know it so well.

684
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:19,381
That's disgusting.

685
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:22,421
You always say it's disgusting when your mom and I get along.

686
00:37:22,751 --> 00:37:23,751
What's wrong with you?

687
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:27,781
Don't say things like that in front of me. I know everything.

688
00:37:28,421 --> 00:37:30,051
What do you know?

689
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,651
Hey, what do you know?

690
00:37:32,821 --> 00:37:35,551
Do kids know everything through the internet? Well?

691
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:37,591
Forget it. Kids these days are different.

692
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:40,181
She's old enough to know everything. You're getting another call.

693
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:42,621
Why is he calling at this hour?

694
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:44,321
It must be urgent.

695
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:49,621
What is it? Are you getting a divorce?

696
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,651
Did your wife cheat on you with your friend?

697
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:53,751
You're so evil.

698
00:37:54,351 --> 00:37:55,981
Your mouth is more dirty than a toilet.

699
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:57,481
What is it?

700
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:00,981
We're shooting a new romance film called "Her Tears".

701
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:02,221
That's a horrible title.

702
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,281
Goodness, is that a comic book from the 1980s?

703
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:05,981
Just hear me out, okay?

704
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,481
Like "The Beauty Inside", we need some male extras.

705
00:38:11,151 --> 00:38:13,381
It'd be the best to get Young Bin in it.

706
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:16,521
You can't see that, right? I already answered.

707
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:18,421
You jerk. I'll just...

708
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,421
Hey.

709
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:21,651
Jo Tae Young is a co-investor.

710
00:38:22,181 --> 00:38:23,681
I thought you had to get on her good side.

711
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,481
Jo Tae Young?

712
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:27,451
An extra?

713
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:30,751
It's about Young Bin.

714
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:33,251
All right.

715
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:36,621
Gosh.

716
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:06,821
(Do you know what I mean?)

717
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:11,151
I love crime fiction.

718
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:16,251
Me too. It'd be nice if they made a drug king film in Korea.

719
00:39:16,351 --> 00:39:18,451
- That won't happen right? - No way.

720
00:39:19,851 --> 00:39:21,591
I want to do "Lim Hwa Su" even more now.

721
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:27,481
Hey. I want to watch "Narcos", too.

722
00:39:27,621 --> 00:39:30,821
Why are you making pickles now?

723
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:32,421
Because I have to do it right now.

724
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:34,851
Turtle!

725
00:39:36,121 --> 00:39:37,121
Turtle!

726
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:40,751
I'm busy playing Overwatch.

727
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:43,621
They're watching "Narcos" on their own!

728
00:39:44,121 --> 00:39:45,221
Those punks.

729
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:47,351
- Gosh. - Ouch.

730
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:49,351
Phone. The phone.

731
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:50,591
You betrayed us.

732
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:52,321
Yes, Mr. Kim.

733
00:39:53,951 --> 00:39:54,951
What is it?

734
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:57,921
What?

735
00:39:59,751 --> 00:40:02,981
How distracting. It's sad not having work.

736
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:05,621
Shall we also talk on the phone?

737
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:08,851
That's why you're jobless.

738
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:13,021
You're not getting any acting jobs because you don't get jokes.

739
00:40:13,821 --> 00:40:15,451
Shall I ask him?

740
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:17,551
Okay.

741
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:19,881
We got an offer for an extra role.

742
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:22,921
- Yes! - Gosh, you startled me.

743
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:24,281
I'm shooting a commercial.

744
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:26,451
- You two are so distracting. - Seriously?

745
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:27,621
Joon, you go first.

746
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:30,681
Joo Yeon became a model for a game, and she recommended me!

747
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:31,921
- Really? - Gosh.

748
00:40:32,151 --> 00:40:34,281
See? I told you that she'd be good to you.

749
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:37,351
She got me a commercial, so I shall forgive her.

750
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:41,051
Good for you. What were you saying? An extra?

751
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:44,381
We got an offer for you to make a cameo appearance in a film.

752
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,651
Why all of a sudden?

753
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,051
I'm not sure, but what's important is...

754
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:48,751
that Ms. Jo is the investor.

755
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:50,321
Then you have to do it.

756
00:40:50,721 --> 00:40:53,221
Young Bin is too good to appear as a cameo role in a film like that.

757
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,551
Then shall I do it? I need to reconcile with her, too.

758
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:58,321
Why would you do anything? Your bottom has to do the work.

759
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:01,281
The problem is that the shoot will take place in the countryside,

760
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:03,421
and they're also being vague about the role.

761
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:06,051
- I don't care. I have to do it. - Yes, you must.

762
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:07,981
Ms. Jo will at least meet me, then.

763
00:41:09,421 --> 00:41:10,451
Then I'll let them know.

764
00:41:28,381 --> 00:41:30,021
Nice, double!

765
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:32,421
Arms, come out. Arms!

766
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,981
The golden calf is mine.

767
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:37,121
The lucky road, yes!

768
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:38,751
Let's go to the National Tax Service.

769
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,281
- I thought it was a better role. - Go to jail.

770
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:43,421
What is this?

771
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:45,751
Keep it down, will you?

772
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:49,181
Now, please have a look.

773
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:53,251
Cut. That was good. You should take a break.

774
00:41:54,521 --> 00:41:55,521
The dice.

775
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:57,251
The dice!

776
00:41:58,221 --> 00:41:59,521
Yes, the dice is here!

777
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:01,281
Okay.

778
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:04,451
I'm sorry.

779
00:42:15,221 --> 00:42:16,351
Please try to move a little more.

780
00:42:19,721 --> 00:42:20,981
No, the other way.

781
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:28,591
That was good, but let's try one more time. Go the other way.

782
00:42:29,551 --> 00:42:30,551
One, two.

783
00:42:35,821 --> 00:42:38,781
You're rolling off beat. It has to be accurate.

784
00:42:39,451 --> 00:42:41,421
Go a little more. No, the other way.

785
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:43,981
One more time. Face down.

786
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:47,481
- One, two. Do it again. - That's what I want.

787
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:52,581
- A little bit more. - Good work, Joon.

788
00:42:54,151 --> 00:42:56,721
Gosh, be careful with it. Put it away, please.

789
00:42:57,251 --> 00:42:58,621
What is this, seriously?

790
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:02,221
Joon, you at least get to talk.

791
00:43:02,321 --> 00:43:03,681
You say that because you're not doing it.

792
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:06,521
Stop whining already. You're shooting a commercial.

793
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:09,051
How can Joo Yeon recommend me for something like this?

794
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:10,751
Gosh, you're being so ungrateful.

795
00:43:10,981 --> 00:43:12,321
My pride is crushed.

796
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:14,621
She's the main model when I'm...

797
00:43:15,281 --> 00:43:16,281
the dice.

798
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:18,421
Joon, the dice is the most important role.

799
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:20,381
Gosh, you're so insecure.

800
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:23,521
Why do you keep taking her side?

801
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:27,781
Have you become best friends with her after the barbecue? You jerk.

802
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:30,551
Watch your tongue, seriously. I'll leave if you keep this up.

803
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:32,251
Go. Get lost.

804
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:34,251
Go home before I lose it on you. I don't need you.

805
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:38,051
She has always been like this.

806
00:43:38,751 --> 00:43:41,051
Ever since they won the first place on "Music Top 10", they started...

807
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:43,221
belittling us for only doing variety shows. They used to laugh at us.

808
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:46,051
They even ignored us when we said hi to them at the agency.

809
00:43:46,151 --> 00:43:48,351
Gosh, how obnoxious. That witch.

810
00:43:48,981 --> 00:43:51,981
Yes, you're absolutely right. I'll get going, then.

811
00:43:53,151 --> 00:43:54,221
I should get out of here.

812
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:00,751
I'll just come back another time.

813
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:08,581
She... She heard everything.

814
00:44:08,681 --> 00:44:10,321
She heard... She heard everything.

815
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:13,481
She heard every single thing you said.

816
00:45:14,751 --> 00:45:15,751
So?

817
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:18,621
Did you date my friend, Sun Young, secretly?

818
00:45:20,621 --> 00:45:22,051
No, I just slept with her.

819
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:25,681
- There's more, right? - Goodness.

820
00:45:27,581 --> 00:45:29,181
Gosh, what was her name?

821
00:45:30,651 --> 00:45:31,681
Right, Ji Hye.

822
00:45:33,321 --> 00:45:34,321
Is that it?

823
00:45:35,821 --> 00:45:36,821
What about Ah Jeong?

824
00:45:37,881 --> 00:45:39,251
Nothing happened with her, right?

825
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:43,481
- She's my best friend. - What do you want from me?

826
00:45:48,921 --> 00:45:50,381
Goodness gracious. How dare you?

827
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:51,781
Cut.

828
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:57,051
All right, let's try it again.

829
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:01,421
Sure, let's do it.

830
00:46:03,081 --> 00:46:04,081
Ready,

831
00:46:05,081 --> 00:46:06,081
action!

832
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:20,351
- Why was it... - Guys.

833
00:46:21,051 --> 00:46:22,981
Thanks for everything. Great work, today.

834
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:25,381
I must say, she slapped me so hard.

835
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:26,851
I'm sorry.

836
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:28,721
I don't mean to be rude,

837
00:46:29,151 --> 00:46:30,921
but that was different from the script.

838
00:46:31,451 --> 00:46:32,951
Getting slapped in the face wasn't in the script.

839
00:46:33,051 --> 00:46:35,151
Gosh. Go easy on me, please.

840
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,821
I revised it a little at the last minute to make it more fun.

841
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:39,421
It's okay. I had fun.

842
00:46:39,551 --> 00:46:41,051
Eun Gab won't badmouth me, will he?

843
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:43,921
I'll put in a good word for you when I speak to Ms. Jo.

844
00:46:46,321 --> 00:46:47,381
Speak of the devil.

845
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:48,751
Bye.

846
00:46:49,751 --> 00:46:50,751
Yes, Ms. Jo.

847
00:46:51,551 --> 00:46:54,351
Did you know? We shot the scene with Young Bin today.

848
00:46:54,351 --> 00:46:55,421
Hey, it's okay.

849
00:46:56,751 --> 00:46:58,451
That was my first ever loser role, but it was fun.

850
00:46:58,581 --> 00:47:01,151
A loser played a loser. You did a good job.

851
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:03,251
Let's go.

852
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:06,781
- Hello? - Where are you now?

853
00:47:07,481 --> 00:47:09,221
Me? I'm in front of my place.

854
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:10,851
Where exactly?

855
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:15,881
- I'm here. - Gosh.

856
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,081
Are you waiting for Young Bin again?

857
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:24,881
No, not today. I'm just...

858
00:47:27,781 --> 00:47:28,821
I just wanted to come here.

859
00:47:30,721 --> 00:47:32,121
I guess you're going home.

860
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:34,351
Yes. I packed up all of my stuff.

861
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:36,921
I came just in case, but I'm so lucky.

862
00:47:43,281 --> 00:47:45,281
I'm actually here to see you.

863
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:48,851
Me... Me?

864
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:55,181
I'm embarrassed that I said it.

865
00:48:03,621 --> 00:48:05,721
What's wrong? Are you hungry again?

866
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:08,251
No, my stomach is a little upset.

867
00:48:09,421 --> 00:48:11,581
Can I use your bathroom?

868
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:14,251
Sure. You shouldn't hold it in if it's number two.

869
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:16,051
- Thank you. - Let's go.

870
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:21,521
Here. Pick one.

871
00:48:21,851 --> 00:48:23,081
I'll give it to you as a souvenir.

872
00:48:23,751 --> 00:48:26,121
My goodness. You seriously rock.

873
00:48:28,981 --> 00:48:30,051
I'll be right back.

874
00:48:31,081 --> 00:48:33,221
- You can only pick one, okay? - All right.

875
00:48:34,521 --> 00:48:36,051
Just so you know, the gray one is the cheapest.

876
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:41,751
Just apologize to her. What else can you say?

877
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:43,851
I can't. I'm too embarrassed!

878
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:47,281
You shouldn't blame it on her no matter how bad the situation is.

879
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:50,721
Also, I don't think you realize that Joo Yeon likes you.

880
00:48:51,021 --> 00:48:52,521
You're at it again.

881
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,921
You're basically kicking your luck away.

882
00:48:54,921 --> 00:48:56,551
I clearly told you. You deal with the rest.

883
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,451
Did you pick one?

884
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:05,481
What's she doing? Is she out of her mind?

885
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:07,551
Hey.

886
00:49:12,421 --> 00:49:13,451
What on earth are you doing here?

887
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,551
I just wanted to lie down on Cha Young Bin's bed.

888
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:18,621
Stop talking nonsense and just get up.

889
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:20,951
Just a little more. Just one more minute.

890
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,981
Do you think that this is a sauna or what?

891
00:49:23,221 --> 00:49:25,851
- Get up already. - Gosh, just a little more.

892
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:27,881
- Why are you so strong? - Please, please...

893
00:49:37,051 --> 00:49:38,121
Where am I right now?

894
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:47,181
Well...

895
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:50,981
That wasn't... That wasn't intentional.

896
00:49:51,651 --> 00:49:52,721
I should get up now.

897
00:49:55,921 --> 00:49:59,881
I wasn't going to give you the shirt if you stayed like that for longer.

898
00:49:59,981 --> 00:50:01,881
What am I saying? I'm not making much sense.

899
00:50:02,781 --> 00:50:03,821
I'm sorry.

900
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:05,921
No, I'm sorry. Oh, I can take care of this.

901
00:50:16,951 --> 00:50:19,151
Can we talk?

902
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:28,221
Go ahead.

903
00:50:28,821 --> 00:50:30,251
You heard everything I said, right?

904
00:50:32,951 --> 00:50:34,021
I'm sorry.

905
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:38,851
Well...

906
00:50:42,121 --> 00:50:43,321
Your band...

907
00:50:44,251 --> 00:50:45,981
was very popular.

908
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:49,821
My band failed and broke up.

909
00:50:52,981 --> 00:50:55,121
Whenever I saw you,

910
00:50:56,651 --> 00:50:59,381
I felt jealous. That's probably why.

911
00:51:02,881 --> 00:51:04,481
It was petty of me.

912
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:08,021
I'm sorry.

913
00:51:12,951 --> 00:51:13,951
I'm sorry.

914
00:51:14,651 --> 00:51:15,751
Was it funny?

915
00:51:16,181 --> 00:51:19,221
It's just that outfit. It looks silly.

916
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:22,751
You talked so seriously in that outfit.

917
00:51:25,921 --> 00:51:27,021
All right. Laugh.

918
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:32,351
Please laugh as much as you want and accept my apology.

919
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:34,421
It's okay.

920
00:51:35,121 --> 00:51:38,981
I was young back then. I did many bad things to people around me.

921
00:51:40,251 --> 00:51:42,451
Our hectic schedule made me tired,

922
00:51:42,551 --> 00:51:44,421
and my agency didn't give me much freedom.

923
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:46,921
I couldn't look around myself.

924
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:51,381
I was a weird kid.

925
00:51:52,751 --> 00:51:53,781
You think so?

926
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:55,821
Also,

927
00:51:57,751 --> 00:52:00,021
I've never looked down on or laughed at you.

928
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:02,621
On the contrary,

929
00:52:04,151 --> 00:52:05,521
I liked you.

930
00:52:10,481 --> 00:52:12,451
What are you talking about?

931
00:52:13,481 --> 00:52:15,951
I was young, and I wasn't allowed to date.

932
00:52:16,721 --> 00:52:18,221
That's why I couldn't tell you.

933
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:25,521
Is that true?

934
00:53:33,221 --> 00:53:35,021
Get some part-time jobs and go back to school.

935
00:53:35,681 --> 00:53:38,251
I had so much fun in college. I'd love to go back.

936
00:53:39,351 --> 00:53:40,381
I will.

937
00:53:41,621 --> 00:53:43,951
In the end, I saw Young Bin only once from afar.

938
00:53:44,951 --> 00:53:46,651
Still, I'm happy I met you.

939
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:50,481
Are you?

940
00:53:50,781 --> 00:53:54,381
Thank you for this, too. You're a great guy.

941
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:56,421
The shirt is not even mine.

942
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:58,381
It's not only about that.

943
00:53:58,951 --> 00:54:00,351
You really are a great guy.

944
00:54:03,951 --> 00:54:04,951
I'm just...

945
00:54:05,681 --> 00:54:06,751
an unemployed good-for-nothing.

946
00:54:07,381 --> 00:54:08,951
What's wrong about being unemployed?

947
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:11,981
You're very cheerful and kind.

948
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:14,881
You're on the same wavelength with me, too.

949
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:17,381
You look good, too.

950
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:19,781
I look good?

951
00:54:20,481 --> 00:54:21,621
My goodness.

952
00:54:26,351 --> 00:54:28,581
I'll call you. You can leave now.

953
00:54:29,121 --> 00:54:30,221
My bus will be here soon.

954
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:33,781
All right. I'll get going.

955
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:35,921
Make sure...

956
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:40,181
- to call me. - I will.

957
00:54:40,721 --> 00:54:41,721
Make sure.

958
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:43,581
- Make sure. - Okay.

959
00:55:09,051 --> 00:55:10,051
What?

960
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:13,251
What is it now?

961
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:15,351
Joo Yeon and I are together!

962
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:17,551
Did you have a dream?

963
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:19,151
It's true.

964
00:55:19,321 --> 00:55:22,721
She said she had liked me for a long time.

965
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:27,521
What's with her? Is she pulling your leg?

966
00:55:27,581 --> 00:55:30,821
Are you kidding me? She meant it.

967
00:55:32,151 --> 00:55:34,651
I'm sure she'll regret it.

968
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:37,321
Hey, you should congratulate me.

969
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:41,381
Fine, congratulations. Are you sure it's real?

970
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:43,181
Isn't it some kind of fraud?

971
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:45,521
Cut it out. Where are you?

972
00:55:45,621 --> 00:55:48,921
I'm seeing Min Ah off at the bus terminal.

973
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:50,981
What?

974
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:53,421
Wasn't it going well between you two?

975
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:55,681
What are you talking about?

976
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:58,521
Don't try to deny it.

977
00:55:58,651 --> 00:56:01,151
You guys looked like a perfect match.

978
00:56:01,521 --> 00:56:02,681
She's a female version of you.

979
00:56:02,951 --> 00:56:05,151
She's a geek, has no job, and is shameless.

980
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:06,351
Give it a try.

981
00:56:07,221 --> 00:56:09,881
She seemed to like you, too.

982
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:12,821
No one likes anyone. You're being ridiculous.

983
00:56:12,951 --> 00:56:15,051
I told you clearly. Don't regret it later.

984
00:56:15,681 --> 00:56:18,151
I should tell Young Bin and Ho Jin, too. Bye.

985
00:56:40,051 --> 00:56:42,481
(Share)

986
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:47,681
You haven't left?

987
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:49,621
No, I haven't.

988
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:52,851
I have something to tell you.

989
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:55,251
- What is it? - The thing is...

990
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:59,451
I'm not saying this on the spur of the moment.

991
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:02,781
I've wanted to say this for a long time.

992
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:06,551
Were you in the middle of something?

993
00:57:09,021 --> 00:57:10,881
I was posting on social media.

994
00:57:11,451 --> 00:57:12,451
Sorry?

995
00:57:13,251 --> 00:57:16,181
I have a picture of his room. I'm going to sell the shirt.

996
00:57:17,021 --> 00:57:18,181
People will go crazy over it.

997
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:21,751
Do you have to do it?

998
00:57:22,181 --> 00:57:24,381
Why? It's mine now.

999
00:57:24,851 --> 00:57:26,081
It is,

1000
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:28,081
but Young Bin's boss...

1001
00:57:28,181 --> 00:57:31,421
swears a lot. He's not a bad person, though.

1002
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:32,651
There's a guy called Ho Jin, too.

1003
00:57:32,651 --> 00:57:36,151
He's a petty guy. He'll get angry at me.

1004
00:57:36,181 --> 00:57:39,981
Those two will give me a hard time. Please.

1005
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:43,451
I was going to sell this and come back here next week...

1006
00:57:43,451 --> 00:57:45,051
to get Kim Woo Bin's autograph.

1007
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:49,981
Do you know him by any chance?

1008
00:57:57,251 --> 00:57:58,251
What's wrong?

1009
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:01,651
You're so pathetic.

1010
00:58:05,681 --> 00:58:07,151
I thought you were a nice person,

1011
00:58:08,781 --> 00:58:10,851
but you're really pathetic.

1012
00:58:11,281 --> 00:58:15,121
Cut it out. You're even more pathetic. You have no job.

1013
00:58:15,221 --> 00:58:18,521
A moment ago, you said you liked me even though I had no job.

1014
00:58:18,721 --> 00:58:21,021
You said we were on the same wavelength and all.

1015
00:58:21,121 --> 00:58:23,421
You're a stalker who ran away from home.

1016
00:58:23,451 --> 00:58:24,621
You're so immature.

1017
00:58:24,721 --> 00:58:27,621
You're just a good-for-nothing with a celebrity friend.

1018
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:29,851
Good-for-nothing? You're not even going to school.

1019
00:58:29,951 --> 00:58:32,251
I have part-time jobs. You have nothing.

1020
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:34,321
That's right.

1021
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:39,121
- Anyway, I'll take it. - You can't.

1022
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:43,151
I didn't give it to you so that you could sell it. Give it to me.

1023
00:58:43,251 --> 00:58:45,751
You can't take it back.

1024
00:58:46,921 --> 00:58:49,181
There's a thief!

1025
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:50,881
He's a thief!

1026
00:58:51,421 --> 00:58:53,151
- You're a thief. - Why am I a thief?

1027
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:54,681
Don't ever call me.

1028
00:59:11,221 --> 00:59:14,081
Who else is coming than the director?

1029
00:59:15,081 --> 00:59:19,421
Well, I guess the producer will come, too.

1030
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:20,821
I see.

1031
00:59:24,151 --> 00:59:25,151
By the way,

1032
00:59:25,981 --> 00:59:28,421
I didn't know you'd do this movie.

1033
00:59:29,881 --> 00:59:32,121
You're the one who told me it was good.

1034
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:36,251
Like you said last time,

1035
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:39,551
I think I'll trust you.

1036
00:59:40,681 --> 00:59:41,681
I see.

1037
00:59:49,081 --> 00:59:50,251
- Mr. Lee. - Yes.

1038
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:56,951
The thing is...

1039
00:59:57,851 --> 00:59:59,621
I'll be honest with you.

1040
01:00:00,781 --> 01:00:02,981
It's not a bad movie,

1041
01:00:04,081 --> 01:00:06,851
but I don't think it'd do much good...

1042
01:00:07,621 --> 01:00:09,681
to an actress. It's a small role, too.

1043
01:00:11,551 --> 01:00:14,321
Then why did you tell me to do it?

1044
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,281
It's not appropriate to say it now,

1045
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:23,721
but I'll tell you the truth. If you take this role,

1046
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:27,181
it'd help other actors get roles.

1047
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:29,051
Do you mean Young Bin?

1048
01:00:29,951 --> 01:00:30,951
Yes.

1049
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:33,081
Are you saying you were using me in the negotiation...

1050
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:35,881
to get Young Bin a role?

1051
01:00:36,351 --> 01:00:37,481
Yes, I'm sorry.

1052
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:46,521
You cancel the meeting.

1053
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:47,851
Okay.

1054
01:00:48,981 --> 01:00:52,081
I'll ask Mr. Kim to find me another manager.

1055
01:00:52,521 --> 01:00:53,521
Well...

1056
01:00:56,921 --> 01:00:58,621
I have nothing to say. I'm sorry.

1057
01:01:03,781 --> 01:01:05,751
What can we do? I knew it'd happen.

1058
01:01:06,251 --> 01:01:07,651
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

1059
01:01:08,051 --> 01:01:10,151
It's not your fault. It was my mistake.

1060
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:13,881
When you said you'd recommend that movie to her,

1061
01:01:14,381 --> 01:01:15,881
I didn't feel comfortable.

1062
01:01:16,851 --> 01:01:17,981
I should have stopped you.

1063
01:01:19,451 --> 01:01:20,921
What should I say to her?

1064
01:01:21,021 --> 01:01:24,251
Should I get her a new car or a bag or something?

1065
01:01:25,521 --> 01:01:27,321
Have you heard anything from Ms. Jo?

1066
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:29,321
Young Bin even made a cameo appearance.

1067
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:30,881
The thing is...

1068
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,751
Ms. Jo...

1069
01:01:33,721 --> 01:01:36,251
ordered that Young Bin's scene would get cut out.

1070
01:01:36,551 --> 01:01:39,051
Sorry? Why?

1071
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:42,151
She got angry that they did it without her permission.

1072
01:01:42,251 --> 01:01:43,821
If it weren't for "Lim Hwa Su", I'd...

1073
01:01:45,321 --> 01:01:46,981
I guess we won't be...

1074
01:01:47,851 --> 01:01:49,321
doing "Lim Hwa Su".

1075
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:53,651
What should I tell Young Bin?

1076
01:01:54,781 --> 01:01:56,621
I'm sure there's a way.

1077
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:59,321
Let's talk later. Come to the office first.

1078
01:02:00,881 --> 01:02:01,881
Okay.

1079
01:02:15,881 --> 01:02:16,881
Hello.

1080
01:02:17,381 --> 01:02:19,021
Why did you want to see me?

1081
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:21,421
Are you divorcing your wife or something?

1082
01:02:21,651 --> 01:02:24,081
We could have met at your office, but you insisted. Come in.

1083
01:02:48,981 --> 01:02:49,981
Well...

1084
01:02:50,921 --> 01:02:53,381
I have a favor to ask.

1085
01:03:12,521 --> 01:03:14,351
Please.

1086
01:03:15,081 --> 01:03:17,651
Young Bin is all I have.

1087
01:03:17,951 --> 01:03:19,951
I beg you.

1088
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:22,121
- I'll do my best. - Hey.

1089
01:03:23,081 --> 01:03:24,081
Do you...

1090
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:26,121
have to do this?

1091
01:03:26,321 --> 01:03:28,921
Should I kneel down or something?

1092
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:30,281
Gosh.

1093
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:33,981
You can do this. I beg you.

1094
01:03:34,751 --> 01:03:36,251
Please help me.

1095
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:38,251
- My goodness. - Please.

1096
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:39,451
Hey.

1097
01:03:48,021 --> 01:03:50,251
Did you ask Ms. Kang?

1098
01:03:50,351 --> 01:03:52,351
I did. We're lovers.

1099
01:03:52,481 --> 01:03:53,781
She's helping me.

1100
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:55,751
Why are you staring at me?

1101
01:03:55,881 --> 01:03:59,251
He seems to take my joke seriously.

1102
01:03:59,481 --> 01:04:02,221
I wasn't counting on her help. Did you beg her or something?

1103
01:04:02,581 --> 01:04:03,851
Do you think I'd do that?

1104
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:07,581
Okay.

1105
01:04:15,221 --> 01:04:16,221
Hello.

1106
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:27,151
I wanted to talk to you in private. Is it okay for you?

1107
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:29,381
Yes.

1108
01:04:29,881 --> 01:04:32,051
I heard you wanted to see me.

1109
01:04:33,451 --> 01:04:35,021
Yes. I'd like to do "Lim Hwa Su".

1110
01:04:35,951 --> 01:04:37,351
I wanted to apologize, too.

1111
01:04:38,751 --> 01:04:40,181
About "War Terminator",

1112
01:04:41,421 --> 01:04:42,721
I'm really sorry.

1113
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:46,151
You don't have to do this. I'm not here to hear your apology.

1114
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:48,851
Then...

1115
01:04:49,181 --> 01:04:50,621
I'm here to turn you down.

1116
01:04:51,351 --> 01:04:55,351
I wanted to tell you that I'm not casting you for "Lim Hwa Su".

1117
01:04:55,681 --> 01:04:57,481
From now on, you don't have to do...

1118
01:04:57,481 --> 01:05:00,351
any interviews or cameo appearances for my movies.

1119
01:05:02,351 --> 01:05:04,221
What can I do for you to stop being angry at me?

1120
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:08,581
I'm not angry at you. I'm just not going to work with you.

1121
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:12,021
Can I just do "Lim Hwa Su"?

1122
01:05:12,921 --> 01:05:13,921
No.

1123
01:05:14,621 --> 01:05:16,551
I make movies for a living.

1124
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:18,821
Movies are important to me. It's my job.

1125
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:20,721
Everyone involved is important, too.

1126
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:24,721
You do movies just to meet actresses.

1127
01:05:27,081 --> 01:05:28,521
No, that's not true.

1128
01:05:28,781 --> 01:05:32,651
It is. You do movies so that you can sleep with them.

1129
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:34,051
Like with An So Hee.

1130
01:05:37,281 --> 01:05:38,281
But...

1131
01:05:38,651 --> 01:05:41,681
should I tell you the real reason why I don't want to work with you?

1132
01:05:43,281 --> 01:05:47,721
I never work with actors who can't act.

1133
01:05:48,451 --> 01:05:51,321
You can't act.

1134
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,351
You're a bad actor.

1135
01:06:05,521 --> 01:06:07,721
Why did she want us to leave?

1136
01:06:08,721 --> 01:06:10,581
I'm so worried I'm craving alcohol.

1137
01:06:10,821 --> 01:06:13,051
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

1138
01:06:19,621 --> 01:06:20,681
Mr. Kim.

1139
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:27,121
- What? - Well...

1140
01:06:27,981 --> 01:06:29,021
I...

1141
01:06:29,981 --> 01:06:31,481
ended up...

1142
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,821
seeing you beg Ms. Kang.

1143
01:06:36,321 --> 01:06:38,381
Gosh. Did you?

1144
01:06:38,981 --> 01:06:41,251
It's nothing. You just have to swallow your pride...

1145
01:06:41,351 --> 01:06:42,681
and make some compromises.

1146
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:45,681
Don't tell Young Bin.

1147
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:47,021
Of course.

1148
01:06:48,981 --> 01:06:50,251
I'm sorry about that.

1149
01:06:50,951 --> 01:06:53,881
You don't have to be. He's my actor.

1150
01:06:55,121 --> 01:06:58,081
You got on bad terms with Lee El because of Young Bin. Work it out.

1151
01:06:58,281 --> 01:06:59,281
I will.

1152
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:05,051
It was hard to arrange this meeting. I hope it goes well.

1153
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:06,151
I hope so, too.

1154
01:07:14,151 --> 01:07:16,021
How did it go? Did it go well?

1155
01:07:16,121 --> 01:07:17,221
Why are you out already?

1156
01:07:17,681 --> 01:07:18,721
Are you done already?

1157
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:21,951
Let's go. I don't think I'll be able to do "Lim Hwa Su".

1158
01:07:22,781 --> 01:07:25,681
What did she say? Did you have a fight?

1159
01:07:28,891 --> 01:07:29,951
You're not answering me.

1160
01:07:30,521 --> 01:07:32,721
Ho Jin, keep him here. I'll go talk to her.

1161
01:07:32,721 --> 01:07:33,721
Okay.

1162
01:07:33,781 --> 01:07:35,721
Stay here. Don't go.

1163
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:43,481
What happened?

1164
01:07:45,751 --> 01:07:46,751
What is it?

1165
01:07:47,681 --> 01:07:49,921
- I don't want to talk. Let's go. - Wait. What is it?

1166
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:53,721
Come on. We came all the way here, and what happened?

1167
01:07:55,521 --> 01:07:58,391
You have to tell me.

1168
01:07:59,521 --> 01:08:02,021
Wasn't it you that wanted this meeting?

1169
01:08:02,951 --> 01:08:04,751
I didn't know it'd go like this.

1170
01:08:05,391 --> 01:08:07,681
She wasn't going to work with me.

1171
01:08:07,781 --> 01:08:09,151
She just wanted to take her anger out on me.

1172
01:08:09,521 --> 01:08:11,481
She only talked about "War Terminator".

1173
01:08:11,951 --> 01:08:12,951
Gosh.

1174
01:08:13,581 --> 01:08:14,981
Didn't you expect it?

1175
01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:17,391
Didn't you?

1176
01:08:18,681 --> 01:08:21,891
You wanted the movie desperately. Why didn't you just put up with it?

1177
01:08:23,481 --> 01:08:24,481
Put up with it?

1178
01:08:24,481 --> 01:08:26,621
Yes. You should've just put up with it. Mr. Kim even...

1179
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:32,681
Mr. Kim went through so much. I had to run here and there, too.

1180
01:08:32,681 --> 01:08:33,751
What's wrong with you?

1181
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:37,051
You said you'd apologize to her and beg her.

1182
01:08:37,121 --> 01:08:39,281
What are you doing now? You dashed out after a minute.

1183
01:08:39,581 --> 01:08:41,051
I had a good reason.

1184
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:42,621
You should have put up with it.

1185
01:08:43,521 --> 01:08:45,921
You should have kneeled down and begged her.

1186
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:47,751
Do you have any idea what I...

1187
01:08:50,391 --> 01:08:51,421
Forget it.

1188
01:08:52,781 --> 01:08:55,451
You quit whenever you feel slightly irritated.

1189
01:08:58,181 --> 01:09:01,151
I'm getting tired of it. We worked so hard in vain.

1190
01:09:01,851 --> 01:09:02,851
Do you think so?

1191
01:09:04,581 --> 01:09:05,581
Then quit.

1192
01:09:10,121 --> 01:09:11,151
I will.

1193
01:09:15,021 --> 01:09:16,021
Get lost.

1194
01:09:16,951 --> 01:09:19,521
- You jerk. - You idiot.

1195
01:09:52,151 --> 01:09:53,651
(Entourage)

1196
01:09:55,321 --> 01:09:57,451
Isn't Ho Jin coming home?

1197
01:09:57,551 --> 01:09:59,681
He told me to quit. I will.

1198
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:01,421
Do you want me to bring Ho Jin back?

1199
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:02,951
He's mean.

1200
01:10:03,051 --> 01:10:04,981
He's impatient, stubborn, and short-tempered.

1201
01:10:05,021 --> 01:10:06,321
Did he tell on me like a child?

1202
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:08,551
- Young Bin thinks... - Does he think I'm irresponsible?

1203
01:10:08,651 --> 01:10:09,851
I just told the truth.

1204
01:10:10,021 --> 01:10:12,821
It's not because he's my actor. If you have eyes, you'd know it!

1205
01:10:13,021 --> 01:10:14,891
You've been working so hard so far!

1206
01:10:15,081 --> 01:10:16,251
I won't see you again.

1207
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:19,251
What are you doing? Did you decide without telling me?

1208
01:10:20,251 --> 01:10:22,251
I have no reason to go on. It's meaningless.
