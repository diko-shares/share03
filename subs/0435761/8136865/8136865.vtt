1
00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:08.399
Money, money, money. Hey!

2
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.560
You got a date with justice,
One-Eyed Bart.

3
00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:20.440
Too bad, Sheriff. I'm a married man.

4
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.520
One-Eyed Betty!

5
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:40.401
I think you dropped something, mister.

6
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.161
- Jessie?
- Give it up, Bart!

7
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.681
You've reached the end of the line!

8
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:45.841
I always wanted to go out with a bang!

9
00:01:55.442 --> 00:01:56.761
- Oh, no!
- The orphans!

10
00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:01.523
Hate to leave early, but our ride is here.

11
00:02:06.322 --> 00:02:09.242
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.

12
00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:14.643
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

13
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:21.203
Hold him steady!

14
00:02:26.643 --> 00:02:27.643
Woody, hurry!

15
00:02:48.165 --> 00:02:49.205
No!

16
00:02:57.725 --> 00:02:59.485
Glad I could catch the train!

17
00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:01.725
Now let's catch some criminals.

18
00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:04.246
To infinity and beyond!

19
00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:22.126
Reach for the sky.

20
00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:23.487
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

21
00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:26.647
I brought my attack dog
with a built-in force field.

22
00:03:34.487 --> 00:03:37.887
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

23
00:03:56.968 --> 00:03:58.169
Evil Dr Pork Chop!

24
00:04:00.608 --> 00:04:03.008
That's Mr Evil Dr Pork Chop to you.

25
00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:45.651
"Buzz, shoot your laser at my badge."

26
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.490
"Woody, no. It'll kill you." "Just do it!"

27
00:04:52.012 --> 00:04:54.811
"You're going to jail, Bart." "Watch out!"

28
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:57.892
Mom!

29
00:04:58.012 --> 00:05:00.852
No, no, no. Just keep playing.
Just pretend I'm not here.

30
00:05:00.932 --> 00:05:01.972
Oh, no, Molly!

31
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:05.612
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's a 50-foot baby from outer space.

32
00:05:05.692 --> 00:05:08.293
And she's on a rampage.
Run for your lives!

33
00:05:08.413 --> 00:05:11.452
Buster, get out of there.
Does the red light mean it's going?

34
00:05:12.772 --> 00:05:14.692
Come on.
Say "Happy birthday" to Molly.

35
00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:18.413
- Happy birthday!
- Charming.

36
00:05:18.573 --> 00:05:20.093
Happy birthday!

37
00:05:21.093 --> 00:05:23.853
- Look how tall you're getting.
- Yeah!

38
00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:33.694
" Came as fast as I could.
Buzz, behind you!"

39
00:05:33.773 --> 00:05:35.294
"Got it, Woody."

40
00:05:35.934 --> 00:05:38.014
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

41
00:05:39.614 --> 00:05:41.133
"Good work, Buzz."

42
00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:07.936
Okay, places, everyone.
Come on, come on. Get in position.

43
00:06:08.015 --> 00:06:10.136
Wait! I can't find my other eye.

44
00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:12.695
- All right, whose foot's in my face?
- It's mine. Give it back.

45
00:06:12.776 --> 00:06:15.456
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

46
00:06:15.695 --> 00:06:17.696
Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to ya?

47
00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:21.896
Yes. No. I mean, why would I mind
squeezing next to you?

48
00:06:22.736 --> 00:06:23.736
Is it hot in here?

49
00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:24.857
Here they come!

50
00:06:28.257 --> 00:06:29.296
Sarge, you got it?

51
00:06:29.377 --> 00:06:30.697
Mission accomplished.

52
00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:31.897
Hooray!

53
00:06:33.176 --> 00:06:35.016
Careful. Careful!

54
00:06:37.377 --> 00:06:40.297
All right, guys. We got one shot at this.
Everyone ready?

55
00:06:40.376 --> 00:06:42.097
We're ready, Woody. Let's do it!

56
00:06:42.297 --> 00:06:44.257
Okay, Buzz. Make the call.

57
00:06:56.578 --> 00:06:58.818
Target is on approach.

58
00:06:58.898 --> 00:07:01.098
Just like we rehearsed it, guys.

59
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.059
Hello?

60
00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:20.419
Hello? Anyone there?

61
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.139
Molly, stay out of my room!

62
00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:25.220
I wasn't in your room.

63
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.180
Then who was messing with my stuff?

64
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.580
It wasn't me.

65
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.900
Well, that went well.

66
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:39.820
He held me! He actually held me!

67
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:41.781
This is just sad.

68
00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:44.181
Who we kiddin'?
The kid's 17 years old.

69
00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:46.021
We ain't ever gettin' played with.

70
00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:51.222
Guys, hey, hold up.

71
00:07:51.461 --> 00:07:53.862
We need a staff meeting.
Everyone! A staff meeting!

72
00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:55.062
Not again!

73
00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:58.141
Come on. Slink, gather everyone up.

74
00:07:58.221 --> 00:07:59.462
We are gathered, Woody.

75
00:08:00.422 --> 00:08:01.942
Okay. First off,

76
00:08:02.422 --> 00:08:05.902
we all knew Operation Playtime
was a long shot.

77
00:08:06.142 --> 00:08:07.341
More like a misfire.

78
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:11.262
But we've always said this job isn't
about getting played with. It's about...

79
00:08:11.342 --> 00:08:13.382
Being there for Andy. We know.

80
00:08:13.463 --> 00:08:14.902
But we can try again! Right?

81
00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:19.143
I'm callin' it, guys.
We're closing up shop.

82
00:08:19.223 --> 00:08:20.382
What?

83
00:08:20.463 --> 00:08:23.782
Andy's going to college any day now.
That was our last shot.

84
00:08:24.584 --> 00:08:26.063
We're going into attic mode, folks.

85
00:08:26.142 --> 00:08:27.943
Keep your accessories
with you at all times.

86
00:08:28.023 --> 00:08:30.904
Spare parts, batteries, anything
you need for an orderly transition.

87
00:08:30.983 --> 00:08:34.383
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished! Over the hill!

88
00:08:34.464 --> 00:08:37.064
Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys.
We all knew this day was coming.

89
00:08:37.504 --> 00:08:39.143
Yeah, but now it's here.

90
00:08:39.224 --> 00:08:41.464
Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see...

91
00:08:41.544 --> 00:08:42.824
Hey, Sarge! What are you doing?

92
00:08:43.664 --> 00:08:46.384
War's over, folks.
Me and the boys are moving on.

93
00:08:46.665 --> 00:08:48.424
- Moving on?
- You're going AWOL?

94
00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:51.185
We done our duty. Andy's grown up.

95
00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:53.424
And let's face it,
when the trash bags come out,

96
00:08:53.504 --> 00:08:55.104
we army guys are the first to go.

97
00:08:55.384 --> 00:08:57.625
- Trash bags?
- Who said anything about trash bags?

98
00:08:58.065 --> 00:09:01.665
It has been an honour serving with you.
Good luck, folks.

99
00:09:03.184 --> 00:09:04.664
You're gonna need it.

100
00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:06.425
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

101
00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:08.905
- We're getting thrown away?
- No. No one's getting thrown away.

102
00:09:09.146 --> 00:09:10.145
How do you know?

103
00:09:10.225 --> 00:09:12.145
- We're being abandoned!
- We'll be fine, Jessie.

104
00:09:12.225 --> 00:09:14.506
- So why did Sarge leave?
- Should we leave?

105
00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:17.705
<i>1 thought we were goin' to the attic.
- Hate all this uncertainty!</i>

106
00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:19.666
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet!

107
00:09:19.745 --> 00:09:23.465
No one's getting thrown out, okay?
We're all still here.

108
00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:26.666
I mean, yeah,
we've lost friends along the way.

109
00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:30.186
- Wheezy and Etch and...
- Bo Peep?

110
00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:34.426
Yeah. Even Bo.

111
00:09:35.067 --> 00:09:37.627
All good toys
who've gone on to new owners.

112
00:09:37.706 --> 00:09:41.227
But through every yard sale, every
spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!

113
00:09:41.867 --> 00:09:44.587
He must care about us,
or we wouldn't be here.

114
00:09:45.067 --> 00:09:49.227
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in
the attic. It'll be safe and warm...

115
00:09:49.307 --> 00:09:51.628
- And we'll all be together.
- Exactly!

116
00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:53.469
There's games up there,
and books, and...

117
00:09:53.548 --> 00:09:56.428
- The racecar track!
- The racecar track. Thank you!

118
00:09:56.507 --> 00:09:59.748
- And the old TV.
- There you go, the old TV.

119
00:09:59.828 --> 00:10:03.788
And those guys from the Christmas
decorations box. They're fun, right?

120
00:10:03.868 --> 00:10:05.229
Yeah.

121
00:10:05.308 --> 00:10:08.829
And someday, if we're lucky,
Andy may have kids of his own.

122
00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:11.348
And he'll play with us then, right?

123
00:10:11.429 --> 00:10:13.069
We'll always be there for him.

124
00:10:13.268 --> 00:10:16.269
Come on, guys.
Let's get our parts together, get ready,

125
00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:18.708
and go out on a high note.

126
00:10:18.789 --> 00:10:20.469
I'd better find my other eye.

127
00:10:20.549 --> 00:10:22.469
Where'd you leave it this time?

128
00:10:22.548 --> 00:10:25.510
Some place dark. And dusty.

129
00:10:25.589 --> 00:10:28.830
Come on. Let's see how much
we're going for on eBay.

130
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.390
Don't worry. Andy's gonna
take care of us. I guarantee it!

131
00:10:56.471 --> 00:10:58.351
You guarantee it, huh?

132
00:10:58.432 --> 00:11:01.352
I don't know, Buzz.
What else could I say?

133
00:11:02.232 --> 00:11:04.951
Well, whatever happens,
at least we'll all be together.

134
00:11:06.311 --> 00:11:08.192
For infinity and beyond.

135
00:11:09.552 --> 00:11:10.991
- Can I have your stereo?
'NO.

136
00:11:11.073 --> 00:11:13.153
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm taking it with me.

137
00:11:18.392 --> 00:11:20.032
- Can I have your computer?
'NO.

138
00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:22.313
- Your video games?
- Forget it, Molly.

139
00:11:22.393 --> 00:11:24.033
Okay. Andy, let's get to work here.

140
00:11:24.153 --> 00:11:27.592
Anything you're not taking to college
either goes in the attic, or it's trash.

141
00:11:27.673 --> 00:11:30.513
- Mom, I'm not leaving till Friday.
- Come on. It's garbage day.

142
00:11:30.593 --> 00:11:32.353
- Mom.
- Look, it's simple.

143
00:11:32.433 --> 00:11:36.593
Skateboard, college.
Little League trophy, probably attic.

144
00:11:36.673 --> 00:11:39.034
Apple core, trash. You can do the rest.

145
00:11:39.793 --> 00:11:41.394
Why do you still have these toys?

146
00:11:41.914 --> 00:11:43.434
Molly, out of my room!

147
00:11:43.513 --> 00:11:45.113
Three more days and it's mine!

148
00:11:45.194 --> 00:11:47.514
Molly, you're not off the hook either.

149
00:11:47.593 --> 00:11:49.354
You have more toys
than you know what to do with.

150
00:11:49.754 --> 00:11:51.514
Some of them could make
other kids really happy.

151
00:11:51.593 --> 00:11:52.714
What kids?

152
00:11:52.794 --> 00:11:55.474
The children at the daycare.
They're always asking for donations.

153
00:11:55.795 --> 00:11:56.834
What's daycare?

154
00:11:56.914 --> 00:11:57.995
- Mom.
- No buts.

155
00:11:58.115 --> 00:12:01.675
You choose the toys you want to
donate, I'll drop them off at Sunnyside.

156
00:12:12.396 --> 00:12:13.715
Poor Barbie.

157
00:12:13.795 --> 00:12:14.996
I get the Corvette.

158
00:12:15.075 --> 00:12:17.435
Andy, come on.
You need to start making decisions.

159
00:12:17.515 --> 00:12:18.516
Like what?

160
00:12:18.595 --> 00:12:20.395
Like what are you gonna do
with these toys?

161
00:12:20.476 --> 00:12:22.316
- Should we donate them to Sunnyside?
- No.

162
00:12:22.396 --> 00:12:23.556
Maybe sell them online?

163
00:12:23.636 --> 00:12:25.436
Mom, no one's gonna want
those old toys.

164
00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:27.396
They're junk.

165
00:12:27.477 --> 00:12:29.117
Fine. You have till Friday.

166
00:12:29.196 --> 00:12:31.756
Anything that's not packed for college
or in the attic

167
00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:34.717
- is getting thrown out.
- Whatever you say, Mom.

168
00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:26.919
- What's happening?
- We're getting thrown out, you idiot.

169
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.039
That's what's happening.

170
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.760
<i>- You need a hand?
1 got it.</i>

171
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.160
Here.

172
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.920
So, you gonna miss me when I'm gone?

173
00:13:47.001 --> 00:13:49.280
- If 1 say no, do I still get your room?
- Nope.

174
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.121
Then, yes, I'll miss you.

175
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.921
I can't breathe!

176
00:13:53.001 --> 00:13:55.201
- This can't be happening!
- Quiet! What's that sound?

177
00:14:05.841 --> 00:14:06.881
Andy!

178
00:14:09.762 --> 00:14:11.761
That's not trash. That's not trash!

179
00:14:11.842 --> 00:14:13.921
Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.

180
00:14:14.842 --> 00:14:17.162
Buster! Come here, boy! Come here!

181
00:14:23.122 --> 00:14:24.482
Okay, boy. To the kerb!

182
00:14:28.482 --> 00:14:30.043
No, Buster! No!

183
00:14:32.762 --> 00:14:34.682
Get up. Buster!

184
00:14:49.804 --> 00:14:52.004
- We're on the kerb!
- I knew it would come to this!

185
00:14:52.084 --> 00:14:53.525
Pull, everyone! Pull!

186
00:15:03.484 --> 00:15:05.445
- It won't rip!
- Forget it!

187
00:15:05.524 --> 00:15:08.044
It's triple-ply,
high-density polyethylene!

188
00:15:08.124 --> 00:15:09.245
There's gotta be a way out!

189
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.844
Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?

190
00:15:11.205 --> 00:15:12.445
Point. Point. Point!

191
00:15:15.965 --> 00:15:17.325
Push! Push!

192
00:15:17.405 --> 00:15:18.845
I can hear the garbage truck!

193
00:15:20.126 --> 00:15:21.565
It's getting closer.

194
00:15:57.407 --> 00:15:58.847
Buzz! Jessie!

195
00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:09.649
- Andy threw us out.
- Like we were garbage.

196
00:16:09.728 --> 00:16:12.368
- Junk. He called us junk.
- How could he?

197
00:16:13.968 --> 00:16:15.168
This doesn't make any sense.

198
00:16:15.249 --> 00:16:18.649
I should have seen this coming.
It's Emily all over again.

199
00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:21.049
- Sarge was right.
- Yeah, and Woody was wrong.

200
00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:23.609
Wait a minute. Wait, hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.

201
00:16:23.688 --> 00:16:25.289
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.

202
00:16:25.369 --> 00:16:27.009
- Should we be hysterical?
- No!

203
00:16:27.089 --> 00:16:29.049
- Yes!
- Maybe! But not right now!

204
00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:33.249
Fellas, I know what to do.

205
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.931
What the heck?

206
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.690
- We should've done this years ago.
- Jessie, wait. What about Woody?

207
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.690
He's fine, Buzz.
Andy's taking him to college.

208
00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:49.490
Now we need to go!

209
00:16:51.091 --> 00:16:52.370
You're right. Come on.

210
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.651
- Buzz?
- Woody!

211
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.691
What's going on? Don't you know
this box is being donated?

212
00:16:57.771 --> 00:16:59.651
It's under control, Woody.
We have a plan.

213
00:16:59.731 --> 00:17:00.931
We're going to daycare!

214
00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:03.531
Daycare?
What, have you all lost your marbles?

215
00:17:03.651 --> 00:17:06.371
Well, didn't you see?
Andy threw us away.

216
00:17:06.451 --> 00:17:08.691
No, no, no, no.
He was putting you in the attic.

217
00:17:08.772 --> 00:17:10.532
Attic? So how did we
end up on the kerb?

218
00:17:10.652 --> 00:17:13.172
That was a mistake.
Andy's mom thought you were trash.

219
00:17:13.252 --> 00:17:15.332
Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.

220
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:16.932
And called us junk!

221
00:17:17.092 --> 00:17:20.052
Yeah, I know. It looks bad.
But, guys, you gotta believe me.

222
00:17:20.132 --> 00:17:21.972
Sure thing, college boy!

223
00:17:22.212 --> 00:17:23.812
Andy's moving on, Woody.

224
00:17:24.092 --> 00:17:25.613
It's time we did the same.

225
00:17:26.772 --> 00:17:28.933
Okay. Out of the box.
Everyone, right now!

226
00:17:29.733 --> 00:17:31.813
Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing outta here.

227
00:17:31.892 --> 00:17:35.013
Woody, wait. We need to figure out
what's best for everyone.

228
00:17:40.653 --> 00:17:43.013
Great. Great! It's gonna take us
forever to get back here.

229
00:17:51.574 --> 00:17:54.333
It's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay.

230
00:17:54.414 --> 00:17:58.854
Well, Molly and I have been
growing apart for years.

231
00:17:58.934 --> 00:18:03.014
It's just... I can't believe
she would throw me away!

232
00:18:03.614 --> 00:18:05.254
Welcome to the club, toots.

233
00:18:05.374 --> 00:18:08.535
Okay, everyone, listen up. We can get
back to Andy's, but we gotta move fast.

234
00:18:08.614 --> 00:18:10.254
We'll hide under the seats
till we get back home.

235
00:18:10.335 --> 00:18:11.736
Get it through your vinyl noggin,
Woody.

236
00:18:11.815 --> 00:18:13.095
Andy doesn't want us any more.

237
00:18:13.376 --> 00:18:15.375
He was putting you in the attic!

238
00:18:15.455 --> 00:18:17.415
He left us on the kerb!

239
00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:20.135
- All right, calm down! Both of you!
- Okay, fine. Fine.

240
00:18:20.215 --> 00:18:21.736
Just wait till you see
what daycare's like.

241
00:18:21.815 --> 00:18:25.296
- Why? What's it like?
- Daycare is a sad, lonely place

242
00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:28.416
for washed-up old toys
who have no owners.

243
00:18:31.456 --> 00:18:32.976
- Quite the charmer, aren't ya?
- You'll see.

244
00:18:33.056 --> 00:18:36.616
As soon as we get to daycare,
you'll be begging to go home.

245
00:18:50.577 --> 00:18:52.458
Can anyone see anything?

246
00:18:52.537 --> 00:18:54.417
- There's a playground!
- Wow!

247
00:18:54.498 --> 00:18:56.418
We hit the jackpot, Bullseye!

248
00:18:56.497 --> 00:18:58.457
So much for sad and lonely, huh?

249
00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:00.698
Okay. Calm down, guys.
Let's just keep this in perspective.

250
00:19:00.777 --> 00:19:02.578
Perspective? This place is perfect.

251
00:19:02.657 --> 00:19:06.578
Woody, it's nice! See?
The door has a rainbow on it.

252
00:19:10.057 --> 00:19:11.817
- Hey there!
- Wow!

253
00:19:11.898 --> 00:19:13.458
Haven't seen you in ages.

254
00:19:13.538 --> 00:19:15.858
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.

255
00:19:15.938 --> 00:19:19.378
Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are.

256
00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.578
- Say hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

257
00:19:21.658 --> 00:19:23.779
Hey, how are your kids?
Molly and Andy?

258
00:19:23.859 --> 00:19:26.979
Not kids any more.
Andy's going to college on Friday.

259
00:19:27.058 --> 00:19:28.579
- What?
- Can you believe it?

260
00:19:28.659 --> 00:19:32.059
- You sure they won't miss these?
- No, they never get played with.

261
00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:36.339
- You see any kids?
- Where is she taking us?

262
00:19:43.699 --> 00:19:44.820
- Look!
- Wow!

263
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.460
What? What is it?

264
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:52.940
No, no, no.

265
00:19:53.461 --> 00:19:55.019
What's the matter with you?

266
00:19:56.501 --> 00:19:57.741
I can't see!

267
00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.460
Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on!

268
00:20:05.541 --> 00:20:07.661
- So how what do we do?
- We go back to Andy's.

269
00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:10.421
- Anyone see an exit?
- Exit, shmexit. Let's get played with.

270
00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:12.861
Careful. These toys might be jealous
of new arrivals.

271
00:20:13.101 --> 00:20:14.062
- I want to see!
- Hey!

272
00:20:14.142 --> 00:20:15.221
- Rex!
- It's my turn!

273
00:20:20.861 --> 00:20:22.102
New toys!

274
00:20:28.182 --> 00:20:29.942
Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya.

275
00:20:30.142 --> 00:20:31.782
Buzz Lightyear at your service.

276
00:20:32.342 --> 00:20:34.101
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

277
00:20:37.103 --> 00:20:39.263
Thank you. May 1?

278
00:20:42.823 --> 00:20:44.503
The claw!

279
00:20:50.904 --> 00:20:55.024
Well, hello there.
I thought I heard new voices.

280
00:20:55.464 --> 00:20:59.383
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
I'm Lots-o'- Huggin' Bear.

281
00:20:59.864 --> 00:21:01.863
But please call me Lotso.

282
00:21:01.944 --> 00:21:03.743
Buzz Lightyear. We come in...

283
00:21:04.864 --> 00:21:07.665
First thing you gotta know about me,
I'm a hugger.

284
00:21:08.584 --> 00:21:11.465
Look at you all. You've been through
a lot today, haven't ya?

285
00:21:11.544 --> 00:21:13.145
It's been horrible.

286
00:21:13.225 --> 00:21:16.104
Well, you're safe now.
We're all castoffs here.

287
00:21:16.185 --> 00:21:19.545
We been dumped, donated,
yard-saled, secondhanded

288
00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:22.786
and just plain thrown out.
But just you wait,

289
00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:26.306
you'll find being donated was the
best thing that ever happened to ya.

290
00:21:27.065 --> 00:21:30.546
Mr Lotso, do toys here
get played with every day?

291
00:21:30.905 --> 00:21:33.145
All day long. Five days a week.

292
00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:35.065
But what happens
when the kids grow up?

293
00:21:35.145 --> 00:21:36.866
Well, now, I'll tell ya.

294
00:21:36.945 --> 00:21:40.066
When the kids get old,
new ones come in.

295
00:21:40.146 --> 00:21:42.506
When they get old,
new ones replace them.

296
00:21:43.067 --> 00:21:47.346
You'll never be outgrown or neglected,
never abandoned or forgotten.

297
00:21:47.866 --> 00:21:50.707
No owners means no heartbreak.

298
00:21:52.227 --> 00:21:55.547
- It's a miracle.
- And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.

299
00:21:55.626 --> 00:21:56.987
Because we're Andy's toys!

300
00:21:57.067 --> 00:21:59.948
So you got donated by this Andy, huh?

301
00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:02.827
Well, it's his loss, Sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.

302
00:22:02.907 --> 00:22:04.948
- Whoa, whoa, no, no, no...
- Now, let's get you all settled in.

303
00:22:05.228 --> 00:22:09.147
Ken? Where is that boy?
Ken? New toys!

304
00:22:09.228 --> 00:22:11.507
Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso.

305
00:22:15.988 --> 00:22:18.508
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?

306
00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:21.028
Let's show our new friends
where they'll be staying.

307
00:22:21.108 --> 00:22:22.468
Folks, if you want to step
right this way...

308
00:22:31.508 --> 00:22:33.469
Hi, I'm Ken.

309
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:36.550
Barbie. Have we ever met?

310
00:22:37.309 --> 00:22:39.149
I would've remembered.

311
00:22:39.229 --> 00:22:41.829
- Love your legwarmers.
- Nice ascot.

312
00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.790
Come on, Ken.
Recess don't last forever.

313
00:22:44.869 --> 00:22:47.670
Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody.

314
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:52.310
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.

315
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.870
- What a nice bear.
- And he smells like strawberries.

316
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.830
Folks, if I can share,
here at Sunnyside, we've got,

317
00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:01.710
well, just about anything
a toy could ask for.

318
00:23:01.791 --> 00:23:03.510
Spare parts, superglue,

319
00:23:03.591 --> 00:23:06.871
and enough fresh batteries
to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippo.

320
00:23:07.671 --> 00:23:09.110
- Think you're gettin' old?
- Wow.

321
00:23:09.191 --> 00:23:10.671
Well, stop your worryin'.

322
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:14.591
Our repair spa will keep you stuffed,
puffed, and lightly buffed.

323
00:23:16.031 --> 00:23:18.392
And this, well, this is where I live.

324
00:23:18.471 --> 00:23:21.151
It's Ken's Dream House.
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy.

325
00:23:21.632 --> 00:23:24.432
And a whole room
just for trying on clothes.

326
00:23:24.991 --> 00:23:27.191
You have everything!

327
00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:29.991
Everything except
someone to share it with.

328
00:23:32.192 --> 00:23:36.073
You need anything at all,
you just come talk to me. Here we are.

329
00:23:39.513 --> 00:23:40.912
Well, thank you, Big Baby.

330
00:23:41.313 --> 00:23:43.952
Why don't you come meet
our new friends?

331
00:23:44.392 --> 00:23:47.713
Poor baby. We were thrown out
together, me and him.

332
00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:49.913
Abandoned by the same owner.

333
00:23:50.392 --> 00:23:52.753
But we don't need owners
at Sunnyside.

334
00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:55.992
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.

335
00:23:56.074 --> 00:23:58.074
We control our own destiny.

336
00:23:58.633 --> 00:23:59.994
Watch out for puddles.

337
00:24:00.914 --> 00:24:03.554
And here's where you folks'll be stayin'.

338
00:24:03.634 --> 00:24:05.435
The Caterpillar Room.

339
00:24:06.754 --> 00:24:08.594
- Look at this place.
- Wow!

340
00:24:08.674 --> 00:24:10.594
Holy moly guacamole.

341
00:24:10.673 --> 00:24:12.114
Jackpot, baby.

342
00:24:12.514 --> 00:24:13.954
- Whoa, puppy!
- Hello.

343
00:24:14.034 --> 00:24:15.035
- Hello.
- Hello.

344
00:24:16.475 --> 00:24:18.715
It's so beautiful!

345
00:24:20.674 --> 00:24:23.835
What the... Hey, little guy.

346
00:24:23.915 --> 00:24:26.195
How long's it been
since you all got played with?

347
00:24:26.275 --> 00:24:27.274
It's been years.

348
00:24:27.715 --> 00:24:31.395
Well, just you wait.
In a few minutes, that bell's gonna ring,

349
00:24:31.476 --> 00:24:34.155
and you'll get the playtime
that you've been dreamin' of.

350
00:24:34.236 --> 00:24:36.995
Play! Real play! I can't wait!

351
00:24:37.076 --> 00:24:39.836
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we best be headin' back.

352
00:24:39.915 --> 00:24:41.835
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.

353
00:24:41.916 --> 00:24:42.916
- Thank you.
- Take care, pinky.

354
00:24:42.996 --> 00:24:44.517
- Goodbye, Mr Lotso. Thank you.
- Thank you, buddy boy.

355
00:24:44.596 --> 00:24:47.596
- Will I see you again?
- I'll see you tonight

356
00:24:47.676 --> 00:24:49.116
in my dreams.

357
00:24:49.756 --> 00:24:51.436
Ken, let's get a move on.

358
00:24:51.997 --> 00:24:53.797
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.

359
00:24:53.917 --> 00:24:57.517
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.
Heck, you don't know me from G.l. Joe,

360
00:24:57.597 --> 00:24:59.597
but when I look at you,
I feel like we were...

361
00:24:59.677 --> 00:25:01.837
- Made for each other.
- Made for each other.

362
00:25:03.397 --> 00:25:04.517
- Yay!
- Yes.

363
00:25:04.597 --> 00:25:06.397
- Ken?
- Coming, Lotso.

364
00:25:08.557 --> 00:25:10.278
This is so exciting!

365
00:25:16.637 --> 00:25:17.798
Sounds like kids to me.

366
00:25:17.878 --> 00:25:21.157
I want to get played with.
Why can't time go faster?

367
00:25:21.239 --> 00:25:22.718
How many you reckon are out there?

368
00:25:22.798 --> 00:25:24.478
They sound so sweet.

369
00:25:31.119 --> 00:25:33.798
Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.

370
00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:36.240
But we need to go home.

371
00:25:36.319 --> 00:25:38.439
We can have
a whole new life here, Woody.

372
00:25:38.919 --> 00:25:41.399
A chance to make kids happy again.

373
00:25:41.478 --> 00:25:44.119
- Why don't you stay?
- Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.

374
00:25:44.199 --> 00:25:45.360
- Come on, Woodster!
- You'll get played with.

375
00:25:45.439 --> 00:25:46.479
- I can't. No.
- Stay here.

376
00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:48.479
- You can make a new kid happy.
- No, no. Guys, really. No!

377
00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.680
I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!

378
00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.600
And if he wants us at college,
or in the attic,

379
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.281
well, then, our job is
to be there for him.

380
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.761
Now, I'm going home.

381
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.800
Anyone who wants to join me
is welcome. Come on, Buzz.

382
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.681
Buzz?

383
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.481
Our mission with Andy
is complete, Woody.

384
00:26:15.121 --> 00:26:16.201
What?

385
00:26:16.281 --> 00:26:18.241
And what's important now
is we stay together.

386
00:26:18.321 --> 00:26:21.321
We wouldn't even be together
if it weren't for Andy!

387
00:26:21.401 --> 00:26:23.761
Look under your boot, Buzz.
You, too, Jessie.

388
00:26:23.841 --> 00:26:25.001
Whose name is written there?

389
00:26:26.282 --> 00:26:29.122
Maybe Andy doesn't
care about us any more.

390
00:26:29.442 --> 00:26:31.882
Of course he does.
He cares about all of you!

391
00:26:31.962 --> 00:26:33.563
He was putting you in the attic. I saw.

392
00:26:33.642 --> 00:26:35.443
You can't just turn your back
on him now!

393
00:26:35.522 --> 00:26:39.482
Woody, wake up! It's over!
Andy is all grown up!

394
00:26:42.282 --> 00:26:44.202
Okay, fine. Perfect.

395
00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:47.643
I can't believe how selfish you all are.

396
00:26:53.443 --> 00:26:57.442
So this is it?
After all we've been through.

397
00:27:13.483 --> 00:27:15.963
Bullseye, no. You need to stay.

398
00:27:18.924 --> 00:27:21.005
Bullseye, no, I said, "Stay!"

399
00:27:23.084 --> 00:27:24.125
Look,

400
00:27:24.764 --> 00:27:28.844
I don't want you left alone
in the attic, okay? Now, stay.

401
00:27:32.965 --> 00:27:34.085
Bonnie?

402
00:27:34.765 --> 00:27:35.925
Bonnie?

403
00:27:36.886 --> 00:27:38.005
I gotta go.

404
00:27:41.166 --> 00:27:42.966
Bonnie, you in here?

405
00:28:02.767 --> 00:28:05.326
Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no.

406
00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:44.968
What... What the heck?

407
00:28:47.449 --> 00:28:48.649
Now, that's better.

408
00:28:50.009 --> 00:28:52.209
- Bonnie!
- Bluebells, cockleshells...

409
00:28:52.289 --> 00:28:55.169
There you are. Come on, honey.
It's time to go home.

410
00:29:18.611 --> 00:29:20.090
No, no, no, no!

411
00:29:59.254 --> 00:30:01.973
Reach for the sky!

412
00:30:02.452 --> 00:30:06.173
Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny...

413
00:30:12.214 --> 00:30:14.734
You're my favourite deputy.

414
00:30:15.533 --> 00:30:17.013
- Bonnie!
- Coming!

415
00:30:20.654 --> 00:30:21.775
Great.

416
00:30:33.495 --> 00:30:35.255
It's gonna be okay, Bullseye.

417
00:30:35.374 --> 00:30:38.015
Woody's going to college with Andy.
It's what he's always wanted.

418
00:30:38.096 --> 00:30:40.576
He's crazy.
College is no place for a toy.

419
00:30:40.655 --> 00:30:42.255
Toys are for playtime.

420
00:30:42.575 --> 00:30:45.215
Speaking of playtime,
they're lining up out there!

421
00:30:45.295 --> 00:30:47.175
- How many?
- There must be dozens.

422
00:30:47.256 --> 00:30:48.415
I can hardly wait!

423
00:30:48.496 --> 00:30:49.856
Places, everyone!

424
00:31:04.017 --> 00:31:05.897
At last! I'm gonna get played with!

425
00:31:06.857 --> 00:31:08.657
- Rex?
- Come to papa.

426
00:32:01.179 --> 00:32:02.779
There's a snake in my boot.

427
00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:07.900
<i>I'd like to join your posse, boys,
but first I'm gonna sing a little song.</i>

428
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.980
A sheriff!

429
00:32:10.821 --> 00:32:12.380
Move over, Mr Pricklepants.

430
00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:15.021
We have a guest.
You want some coffee?

431
00:32:16.141 --> 00:32:20.821
It's good for you. But don't drink
too much, or you'll have to...

432
00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:22.861
Be right back!

433
00:32:24.061 --> 00:32:25.781
Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me.

434
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.381
Can you tell me where ll am?

435
00:32:28.461 --> 00:32:29.821
The guy's just asking a question.

436
00:32:29.901 --> 00:32:33.341
Well, excuse me.
I'm trying to stay in character.

437
00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:37.222
My name's Buttercup.
You've met Baron von Shush.

438
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:38.702
Hello, I'm Trixie.

439
00:32:40.061 --> 00:32:41.942
Guys, hey. Guys, look,
ll don't know where I am.

440
00:32:42.302 --> 00:32:45.182
We're either in a café in Paris
or a coffee shop in New Jersey.

441
00:32:45.422 --> 00:32:47.102
I'm pretty sure
I just came back from the doctor

442
00:32:47.181 --> 00:32:48.982
with life-changing news.

443
00:32:49.102 --> 00:32:52.182
We do a lot of improv here.
Just stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine.

444
00:32:52.262 --> 00:32:55.143
- No, no, no, no. I...
- Who wants lunch?

445
00:32:57.462 --> 00:33:00.744
It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans.

446
00:33:01.663 --> 00:33:03.823
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

447
00:33:04.903 --> 00:33:07.263
Poison?
Who would do such a mean thing?

448
00:33:11.984 --> 00:33:15.983
The scary witch! Look out!
She's using her witch-y powers!

449
00:33:16.744 --> 00:33:17.944
"I know where to hide."

450
00:33:21.664 --> 00:33:23.744
She'll never find us in here.

451
00:33:24.544 --> 00:33:25.984
What's wrong?

452
00:33:27.144 --> 00:33:30.585
She found us! We need a spaceship
to get away from the witch!

453
00:33:30.664 --> 00:33:33.345
- You're doing great!
- Are you classically-trained?

454
00:33:33.424 --> 00:33:34.985
Look, I just need to know
how to get out of here!

455
00:33:35.064 --> 00:33:36.385
There is no way out.

456
00:33:37.584 --> 00:33:38.904
Just kidding. Door's right over there.

457
00:33:38.985 --> 00:33:41.905
Well, cowboy, you just
jumped right in, didn't ya? I'm Dolly.

458
00:33:41.985 --> 00:33:43.226
- Woody.
- Woody?

459
00:33:43.425 --> 00:33:44.945
Really? You're gonna stick with that?

460
00:33:45.025 --> 00:33:47.545
"Cause now's your chance to change it,
new room and all.

461
00:33:47.626 --> 00:33:49.185
That's coming from a doll named Dolly.

462
00:33:50.265 --> 00:33:52.706
- Who's the new guy?
- Are you a real cowboy?

463
00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:54.866
- Well, actually...
- 'Course he's not, pea brain.

464
00:33:54.946 --> 00:33:58.027
- He don't even have a hat.
- I do too have... My hat!

465
00:33:58.106 --> 00:34:00.227
<i>- Told ya.
- Found a spaceship!</i>

466
00:34:00.466 --> 00:34:01.586
Showtime.

467
00:34:01.665 --> 00:34:04.026
Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts.

468
00:34:04.107 --> 00:34:07.546
Close your tray tables. Hold on.
It might get a little bumpy.

469
00:34:08.106 --> 00:34:10.786
Three, two, one, blastoff!

470
00:34:15.107 --> 00:34:18.427
You saved us, cowboy.
You're our hero.

471
00:34:27.227 --> 00:34:29.227
I got a kink in my slink.

472
00:34:32.108 --> 00:34:34.028
My tail! Where's my tail?

473
00:34:40.228 --> 00:34:41.468
Someone need a hand?

474
00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:43.869
- Where's my nose?
- Here it is.

475
00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:45.148
- Here's your arm.
- Give me that. That's mine.

476
00:34:45.229 --> 00:34:46.309
Honey, the moustache?

477
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:49.029
I don't recall playtime being
quite that strenuous.

478
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:52.309
Andy never played with us like that.

479
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:54.189
We're just gonna have to
make the best of it.

480
00:34:54.309 --> 00:34:55.989
But these toddlers,
they don't know how to play with us.

481
00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.309
- They're too young!
- Yeah, they're sticky.

482
00:34:58.389 --> 00:34:59.910
Well, we should be
in the Butterfly Room.

483
00:34:59.989 --> 00:35:01.510
- With the big kids!
- That's right.

484
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:03.470
- Yeah, you said it.
- We'll get this straightened out.

485
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:06.149
I'll go talk to Lotso
about moving us to the other room.

486
00:35:09.949 --> 00:35:11.310
Blast. Try that one.

487
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:13.470
It's locked!

488
00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:15.470
- Same here.
- Try the windows.

489
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:18.350
Negatory.
It's a Fenster-Schneckler 380.

490
00:35:18.431 --> 00:35:20.071
Finest childproof lock in the world.

491
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:22.150
- We're trapped!
- Wait.

492
00:35:22.231 --> 00:35:23.471
Did anyone notice the transom?

493
00:35:24.871 --> 00:35:26.951
Oh, great. How do we get up there?

494
00:35:28.711 --> 00:35:32.231
All right, everyone. On three!
One, two...

495
00:35:32.751 --> 00:35:33.991
- Three!
- Whoa!

496
00:35:36.031 --> 00:35:37.151
Let go!

497
00:35:48.552 --> 00:35:49.553
Go!

498
00:35:54.272 --> 00:35:55.992
- He did it!
- Yes, sir!

499
00:35:56.913 --> 00:35:58.393
Way to go, Buzz!

500
00:36:00.593 --> 00:36:03.553
Yeah, you think
they had a fun playtime?

501
00:36:03.632 --> 00:36:04.673
They might hear you.

502
00:36:07.633 --> 00:36:09.113
- Okay, now you start.

503
00:36:09.192 --> 00:36:10.353
- Love...
- You.

504
00:36:10.433 --> 00:36:12.673
See? That time, I said "love."
Okay, now me first.

505
00:36:12.753 --> 00:36:13.753
- Okay, okay, okay.

506
00:36:13.834 --> 00:36:14.952
- Love...
- You.

507
00:36:15.274 --> 00:36:16.954
You see what I mean?
It changes every time.

508
00:36:17.034 --> 00:36:18.634
You are so smart.

509
00:36:18.713 --> 00:36:20.274
Come on, Romeo. We're late.

510
00:36:20.794 --> 00:36:22.554
- I'll wait up for you.
- Kisses!

511
00:37:23.677 --> 00:37:25.237
All right, place your bets.
Come on, everybody.

512
00:37:25.316 --> 00:37:26.477
- Come on. Any splits?
- Heya. Bring it here.

513
00:37:26.557 --> 00:37:27.558
- All right.
- Here we go.

514
00:37:27.638 --> 00:37:29.558
- Come on, horsey, come on!
- Come on, turkey, come on, turkey.

515
00:37:29.638 --> 00:37:31.118
- Gobble, gobble, baby.
- Come on, horsey.

516
00:37:31.198 --> 00:37:32.197
Come on, duck.

517
00:37:32.278 --> 00:37:34.038
- All right, that's it. No more bets.
- Come on! Right here.

518
00:37:34.117 --> 00:37:36.118
Let me have the duck, let me have
the duck, let me have the duck!

519
00:37:36.197 --> 00:37:37.677
Here is a duck.

520
00:37:37.838 --> 00:37:39.798
- I won!
- Ah, man!

521
00:37:40.519 --> 00:37:42.958
- Well, Stretch takes the round.
- You lost!

522
00:37:43.038 --> 00:37:44.599
Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly.

523
00:37:44.878 --> 00:37:46.158
- Coyote's wild.
- Here, here.

524
00:37:46.239 --> 00:37:47.679
- Two greens here.
- Changing two double A's.

525
00:37:47.759 --> 00:37:49.799
Hey, what do you guys think
of the new recruits? Any keepers?

526
00:37:49.878 --> 00:37:51.599
Oh, please! Landfill!

527
00:37:51.679 --> 00:37:54.079
- Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
- Toddler fodder.

528
00:37:54.159 --> 00:37:56.878
But that space guy, he could be useful.

529
00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.680
He ain't the sharpest knife in the
place where they keep the knives.

530
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.680
Neither are you, Chunk.

531
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.320
You got a little keeper yourself,
didn't you, Ken?

532
00:38:05.399 --> 00:38:07.759
Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different.

533
00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:09.679
Aw, Mr Softy over here.

534
00:38:09.759 --> 00:38:11.760
What do you expect from a girl's toy?

535
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.880
I'm not a girl's toy! I'm not!
Why do you guys keep saying that?

536
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.521
All them toys are disposable.

537
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.320
We'll be lucky if they last us a week.

538
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.880
Well, well. Looky who we have here.

539
00:38:29.121 --> 00:38:30.200
Let me go!

540
00:38:30.521 --> 00:38:31.880
Take him to the libary.

541
00:38:31.961 --> 00:38:32.961
No!

542
00:39:02.602 --> 00:39:04.603
1225 Sycamore.

543
00:39:05.123 --> 00:39:06.483
Woody, what are you doing?

544
00:39:07.443 --> 00:39:08.443
I gotta get outta here.

545
00:39:08.843 --> 00:39:11.324
- You're leaving?
- But didn't you have fun today?

546
00:39:11.403 --> 00:39:13.123
Well, of course I did,
more than I've had in years,

547
00:39:13.204 --> 00:39:15.243
but, you see, I belong to someone else.

548
00:39:15.483 --> 00:39:18.403
<i>Who's "Yid-nuh"?
1 believe it's pronounced "Yid-nay."</i>

549
00:39:18.483 --> 00:39:20.284
Guys, it says "Andy."

550
00:39:20.364 --> 00:39:21.563
He's my Bonnie.

551
00:39:21.643 --> 00:39:23.683
And he's leaving soon.
I gotta get home.

552
00:39:23.763 --> 00:39:26.364
- Where's home?
- Elm Street. 234 Elm.

553
00:39:26.924 --> 00:39:29.565
- You guys have a map?
- We're on it, cowboy. Trixie?

554
00:39:30.364 --> 00:39:31.924
I'll fire up the computer.

555
00:39:37.045 --> 00:39:40.004
Unhand me, you cowards!
Ll demand to talk to Lotso!

556
00:39:40.284 --> 00:39:41.804
Zip it, Buck Rogers.

557
00:39:41.885 --> 00:39:44.445
You don't talk to Lotso
till we say you can...

558
00:39:46.044 --> 00:39:50.045
Ken? What's goin' on here?
Why is this toy tied up?

559
00:39:50.445 --> 00:39:51.846
He got out, Lotso.

560
00:39:52.405 --> 00:39:58.086
"Got out"? No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't how we treat our guests.

561
00:39:58.206 --> 00:40:02.485
F- A-Oh, my Schwarz.
There you go. I'm so sorry.

562
00:40:02.845 --> 00:40:05.006
- Lotso, there's been a mistake.
- A mistake?

563
00:40:05.087 --> 00:40:07.206
The children in the Caterpillar Room
are not age-appropriate

564
00:40:07.286 --> 00:40:08.487
for me and my friends.

565
00:40:08.566 --> 00:40:11.406
We respectfully request
a transfer to the Butterfly Room.

566
00:40:11.486 --> 00:40:13.246
Well, request granted!

567
00:40:13.326 --> 00:40:15.647
- But, Lotso...
- Hush now, Kenneth.

568
00:40:15.726 --> 00:40:18.887
This toy's shown initiative, leadership.

569
00:40:18.966 --> 00:40:21.006
Why, I'd say
we've found ourselves a keeper.

570
00:40:21.447 --> 00:40:23.887
Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!

571
00:40:27.008 --> 00:40:29.608
We're calling you up
to the big leagues, son.

572
00:40:29.687 --> 00:40:32.407
From now on,
you'll have anything you want.

573
00:40:32.487 --> 00:40:34.447
Excellent. I'll go get my friends.

574
00:40:34.528 --> 00:40:37.008
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.

575
00:40:37.087 --> 00:40:39.368
Those Caterpillar kids
need someone to play with.

576
00:40:39.448 --> 00:40:41.288
But my friends don't belong there.

577
00:40:41.368 --> 00:40:43.328
None of us do, I agree.

578
00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:46.688
Which is why,
for the good of our community,

579
00:40:46.768 --> 00:40:49.168
we ask the newer toys,
the stronger ones,

580
00:40:49.249 --> 00:40:52.768
to take on the hardships
the rest of us can't bear any more.

581
00:40:53.729 --> 00:40:56.128
Well, I guess that makes sense.

582
00:40:57.488 --> 00:41:00.770
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.

583
00:41:00.849 --> 00:41:03.528
Family man, huh? I understand.

584
00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:05.728
Put him back in the timeout chair.

585
00:41:06.689 --> 00:41:09.089
What are ya... Unhand me!

586
00:41:10.529 --> 00:41:12.049
Bring in the Bookworm.

587
00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:17.290
Here it is.

588
00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.370
It was filed under "Lightyear."

589
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.371
Let's see here.

590
00:41:26.931 --> 00:41:29.571
"Accessories. Maintenance."
Here we go.

591
00:41:30.171 --> 00:41:33.251
"Remove screws to access
battery compartment."

592
00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:34.491
What are you doing?

593
00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:36.131
Stop!

594
00:41:36.251 --> 00:41:37.571
Let go of me!

595
00:41:37.691 --> 00:41:42.811
"To return your Buzz Lightyear action
figure to its original factory settings..."

596
00:41:42.932 --> 00:41:46.731
- No!
- "...slide the switch from Play to Demo."

597
00:41:46.812 --> 00:41:50.171
Stop! No! No! No!

598
00:41:51.492 --> 00:41:53.771
- What was that?
- Sounds like it came from the hall.

599
00:41:53.851 --> 00:41:55.371
I'll see what it was.

600
00:41:58.172 --> 00:41:59.532
What do you see? Anything?

601
00:41:59.612 --> 00:42:03.012
No, just a dark hallway and...
Wait. Wait!

602
00:42:03.373 --> 00:42:04.652
I see Andy!

603
00:42:04.972 --> 00:42:06.453
- What?
- That's impossible.

604
00:42:06.532 --> 00:42:08.893
No, no, I really see him. In his room.

605
00:42:09.733 --> 00:42:12.733
My other eye! The one I left behind.

606
00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:18.654
This is so weird. He's packing up.

607
00:42:19.652 --> 00:42:23.974
Here comes Buster.
Out of the way! Get away!

608
00:42:24.974 --> 00:42:26.973
Okay, Andy's out in the hall.

609
00:42:27.494 --> 00:42:29.734
He's looking in the attic.

610
00:42:29.814 --> 00:42:33.055
Wait, there's Mom.
Why is he so upset?

611
00:42:34.053 --> 00:42:36.694
Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!

612
00:42:38.134 --> 00:42:41.094
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us!

613
00:42:41.214 --> 00:42:42.655
He's looking for us?

614
00:42:42.735 --> 00:42:45.454
So Andy does want us.
I knew it! I just knew it!

615
00:42:45.535 --> 00:42:47.736
I think he did mean
to put us in the attic.

616
00:42:48.015 --> 00:42:49.495
Well, then, Woody was telling the truth.

617
00:42:49.815 --> 00:42:51.695
- Holy cow!
- And you didn't believe him.

618
00:42:51.775 --> 00:42:53.254
Hey, you didn't believe him first!

619
00:42:53.336 --> 00:42:56.135
Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home!

620
00:42:58.495 --> 00:42:59.615
- Lotso!
- Hey, there.

621
00:43:00.295 --> 00:43:02.215
How y'all doin' this fine evenin'?

622
00:43:02.656 --> 00:43:04.496
Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz?

623
00:43:04.576 --> 00:43:06.856
There's been a mistake. We have to go.

624
00:43:06.936 --> 00:43:11.256
Go? Why, you just got here.
In the nick of time, too.

625
00:43:11.336 --> 00:43:14.176
We were runnin' low on volunteers
for the little ones.

626
00:43:14.256 --> 00:43:16.856
They just love new toys,
now, don't they?

627
00:43:17.056 --> 00:43:19.817
"Love"? We've been chewed,
kicked, drooled on.

628
00:43:19.896 --> 00:43:21.737
Just look at my pocketbook!

629
00:43:22.937 --> 00:43:26.977
Well, here's the thing, sweet potato.
You ain't leavin' Sunnyside.

630
00:43:27.257 --> 00:43:30.296
" Sweet potato'!
Who do you think you're talking to?

631
00:43:30.538 --> 00:43:35.017
I have over 30 accessories,
and I deserve more respect...

632
00:43:35.857 --> 00:43:37.457
That's better.

633
00:43:37.537 --> 00:43:39.978
Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth,
except me.

634
00:43:40.058 --> 00:43:42.058
Give it back, you furry air freshener!

635
00:43:42.138 --> 00:43:43.738
Come on, guys. We're goin' home.

636
00:43:43.818 --> 00:43:44.817
Whoa there, missy.

637
00:43:45.218 --> 00:43:46.777
You're not goin' anywhere.

638
00:43:47.018 --> 00:43:49.578
Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us?

639
00:43:51.738 --> 00:43:53.019
Buzz! You're back!

640
00:43:53.538 --> 00:43:54.539
Buzz?

641
00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:56.499
Hey!

642
00:43:57.539 --> 00:43:58.779
Look out!

643
00:43:59.098 --> 00:44:00.219
What are you, nuts?

644
00:44:00.458 --> 00:44:01.458
Buzz!

645
00:44:04.978 --> 00:44:07.259
Prisoners disabled,
Commander Lotso!

646
00:44:07.338 --> 00:44:09.460
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- Silence, minions of Zurg!

647
00:44:09.539 --> 00:44:11.540
You're in the custody
of the Galactic Alliance!

648
00:44:11.619 --> 00:44:13.020
- Zurg"?
- "Galactic Alliance"?

649
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.099
Oh, boy.

650
00:44:14.179 --> 00:44:16.780
Good work, Lightyear.
Now, lock 'em up!

651
00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:17.859
Yes, sir!

652
00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.580
Where do you think you're going?

653
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.501
Buzz! We're your friends!

654
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.460
Spare me your lies, temptress.

655
00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:35.941
Your emperor's defeated,

656
00:44:36.021 --> 00:44:39.021
and I'm immune to
your bewitching good looks.

657
00:44:39.101 --> 00:44:41.621
Hey, Mongo!
Keep your paws off my wife!

658
00:44:41.701 --> 00:44:43.341
Hey! Let go of me, you drooling doofus!

659
00:44:43.421 --> 00:44:44.422
Not him.

660
00:44:44.501 --> 00:44:47.861
I think this potato needs to
learn himself some manners.

661
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:49.621
Take him to the box.

662
00:44:49.701 --> 00:44:52.301
Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Where are you taking me?

663
00:44:52.382 --> 00:44:53.742
Bad baby! Bad baby!

664
00:44:53.822 --> 00:44:55.341
Ken? What's going on?

665
00:44:55.662 --> 00:44:58.582
Barbie! I told you to wait
in the Dream House.

666
00:44:58.662 --> 00:44:59.862
What are you doing to my friends?

667
00:45:00.222 --> 00:45:01.662
Get in there!

668
00:45:03.103 --> 00:45:04.942
- Barbie, wait!
- Don't touch me.

669
00:45:05.023 --> 00:45:07.382
- We're through!
- Barbie! I did...

670
00:45:09.022 --> 00:45:10.982
And give me my scarf back!

671
00:45:12.823 --> 00:45:15.583
Lightyear! Explain our
overnight accommodations.

672
00:45:15.983 --> 00:45:18.703
Sir, yes, sir!
Prisoners sleep in their cells.

673
00:45:18.823 --> 00:45:22.383
Any prisoner caught outside their cell
spends the night in the box.

674
00:45:22.823 --> 00:45:24.503
Roll call at dusk and dawn.

675
00:45:24.942 --> 00:45:28.583
Any prisoner misses roll call,
spends the night in the box.

676
00:45:28.903 --> 00:45:31.543
Prisoners do not speak
unless spoken to.

677
00:45:31.624 --> 00:45:33.824
Any prisoner talks back,
spends the night...

678
00:45:33.903 --> 00:45:35.304
In the box! We get it.

679
00:45:36.624 --> 00:45:39.343
At ease, soldier. They're neutralised.

680
00:45:39.424 --> 00:45:42.745
But remember, they'll say anything
to make you doubt yourself.

681
00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:44.105
Don't worry, Commander.

682
00:45:44.184 --> 00:45:47.184
Any doubt I had got pounded
out of me at the academy.

683
00:45:47.864 --> 00:45:49.345
Listen up, folks.

684
00:45:49.425 --> 00:45:51.824
We got a way of doin' things
here at Sunnyside.

685
00:45:52.305 --> 00:45:54.865
If you start at the bottom,
pay your dues,

686
00:45:54.946 --> 00:45:57.105
life here can be a dream come true!

687
00:45:57.905 --> 00:46:00.826
But if you break our rules,
step outta line,

688
00:46:01.585 --> 00:46:07.026
try to check out early,
well, you're just hurtin' yourselves.

689
00:46:08.306 --> 00:46:10.465
Woody! What did you do to him?

690
00:46:10.986 --> 00:46:13.225
You all get a good night's rest.

691
00:46:13.826 --> 00:46:16.466
You got a full day of playtime tomorrow.

692
00:46:22.226 --> 00:46:25.426
1225 Syca...

693
00:46:26.627 --> 00:46:28.827
Who's Velocistar237?

694
00:46:29.187 --> 00:46:31.387
That's just a dinosaur toy
down the street.

695
00:46:31.466 --> 00:46:33.748
That's nothing.
Let me just take care of that.

696
00:46:33.827 --> 00:46:35.548
- Just a dinosaur.
- All right.

697
00:46:35.987 --> 00:46:38.667
Sycamore. Okay, enter!

698
00:46:39.427 --> 00:46:41.428
Please don't be far. Please, please!

699
00:46:42.867 --> 00:46:46.068
Right around the corner?
It's right around the corner!

700
00:46:47.068 --> 00:46:51.268
I'm going to college! Look at me!
I'm big toy on campus! Hello!

701
00:46:51.348 --> 00:46:53.908
- Hey, I'll see you at the sock hop.
- Okay, Potsie.

702
00:46:54.149 --> 00:46:57.428
Hey, listen. If any of you guys
ever get to Sunnyside Daycare,

703
00:46:57.507 --> 00:46:58.548
you tell 'em Woody made it home.

704
00:46:58.628 --> 00:47:01.749
- You came from Sunnyside?
- But how'd you escape?

705
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:03.549
Well, it wasn't easy.

706
00:47:04.508 --> 00:47:05.669
What do you mean "escape"?

707
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:10.229
Sunnyside is a place
of ruin and despair.

708
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:13.669
Ruled by an evil bear
who smells of strawberries.

709
00:47:14.789 --> 00:47:15.909
Lotso?

710
00:47:16.028 --> 00:47:18.550
The guy may seem plush
and huggable on the outside,

711
00:47:18.629 --> 00:47:20.310
but inside, he's a monster.

712
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:22.629
But... How do you know that?

713
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.509
Chuckles. He'll tell you.

714
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:32.950
Yeah, I knew Lotso.

715
00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.951
He was a good toy. A friend.

716
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:41.270
Me and him,
we had the same kid, Daisy.

717
00:47:42.711 --> 00:47:45.510
! was there
when Lotso got unwrapped.

718
00:47:47.832 --> 00:47:49.510
Daisy loved us all.

719
00:47:49.992 --> 00:47:51.111
But Lotso,

720
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:53.271
Lotso was special.

721
00:47:54.711 --> 00:47:56.791
They did everything together.

722
00:47:57.832 --> 00:48:00.792
You've never seen
a kid and a toy more in love.

723
00:48:01.592 --> 00:48:03.512
One day, we took a drive.

724
00:48:04.512 --> 00:48:07.591
Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.

725
00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.553
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

726
00:48:19.353 --> 00:48:20.952
She never came back.

727
00:48:26.073 --> 00:48:28.073
Lotso wouldn't give up.

728
00:48:31.513 --> 00:48:34.714
It took forever,
but we finally made it back to Daisy's.

729
00:48:41.274 --> 00:48:43.915
But by then, it was too late.

730
00:48:55.035 --> 00:48:57.674
Something changed that day
inside Lotso.

731
00:48:58.395 --> 00:48:59.914
Something snapped.

732
00:48:59.994 --> 00:49:02.315
She replaced us. Come on!

733
00:49:02.436 --> 00:49:05.155
- No, she only replaced you!
- She replaced all of us.

734
00:49:05.836 --> 00:49:06.875
Didn't she?

735
00:49:09.836 --> 00:49:12.156
She don't love you no more!

736
00:49:12.475 --> 00:49:13.796
Now come on!

737
00:49:18.476 --> 00:49:23.876
We were lost. Cast off.
Unloved. Unwanted.

738
00:49:28.637 --> 00:49:30.557
Then we found Sunnyside.

739
00:49:40.958 --> 00:49:43.197
But Lotso wasn't my friend any more.

740
00:49:44.798 --> 00:49:46.757
He wasn't anyone's friend.

741
00:49:49.357 --> 00:49:52.398
He took over Sunnyside
and rigged the whole system.

742
00:49:52.957 --> 00:49:54.758
So how'd you get out?

743
00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:58.398
I got broke.
Bonnie found me, took me home.

744
00:49:59.038 --> 00:50:00.998
Other toys, they weren't so lucky.

745
00:50:01.838 --> 00:50:05.039
It ain't right what Lotso done.
New toys,

746
00:50:05.838 --> 00:50:07.679
they don't stand a chance.

747
00:50:07.959 --> 00:50:10.198
- But my friends are in there.
- You can't go back.

748
00:50:10.278 --> 00:50:12.559
Returning now would be suicide!

749
00:50:12.639 --> 00:50:14.359
But what about your Andy?

750
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.239
Isn't he leaving for college?

751
00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.280
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!

752
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.200
Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too.

753
00:50:45.281 --> 00:50:47.440
But he ain't ever comin' back.

754
00:51:08.322 --> 00:51:10.722
Rise and shine, campers!

755
00:51:10.802 --> 00:51:12.323
Commander Lotso, sir!

756
00:51:13.161 --> 00:51:14.562
All quiet, nothing to report.

757
00:51:14.642 --> 00:51:18.083
Excellent, Lightyear. Come on.
We need ya back at Star Command.

758
00:51:18.162 --> 00:51:20.403
Wait! What've you done
with my husband?

759
00:51:20.963 --> 00:51:21.962
Big Baby.

760
00:51:27.483 --> 00:51:28.563
Sweetheart!

761
00:51:30.042 --> 00:51:33.924
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand
and a couple of Lincoln Logs.

762
00:51:34.723 --> 00:51:36.284
I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.

763
00:51:36.363 --> 00:51:39.923
You all get ready.
You got a play-date with destiny!

764
00:52:58.927 --> 00:52:59.928
Hello?

765
00:53:00.007 --> 00:53:01.648
You shouldn't have
come back, cowboy.

766
00:53:01.728 --> 00:53:05.928
They've cracked down hard since
you left. More guards, more patrols.

767
00:53:06.008 --> 00:53:08.048
You and your friends
ain't ever getting out of here now.

768
00:53:08.128 --> 00:53:09.328
I made it out once.

769
00:53:09.408 --> 00:53:12.169
You got lucky once. Want my advice?

770
00:53:12.249 --> 00:53:14.569
Keep your heads down. You'll survive.

771
00:53:14.649 --> 00:53:16.169
Yeah, for how long?

772
00:53:16.249 --> 00:53:17.369
I've been here years.

773
00:53:17.889 --> 00:53:19.769
They'll never break me.

774
00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:22.529
There's only one way
toys leave this place.

775
00:53:23.489 --> 00:53:25.969
Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.

776
00:53:26.409 --> 00:53:28.209
Then it's off to the dump.

777
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:30.890
Look, I appreciate
your concern, old-timer.

778
00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:33.970
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now, we're leaving.

779
00:53:34.049 --> 00:53:37.130
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I'd sure be grateful.

780
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:41.250
Well, if you're gonna get out,

781
00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:43.010
first thing you gotta get through's
the doors.

782
00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:47.730
Locked, every night. Inside and out.
Keys are left on a hook in the office.

783
00:53:47.811 --> 00:53:48.811
Got it. What else?

784
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:50.971
Lotso has trucks
patrolling all night long.

785
00:53:51.451 --> 00:53:53.291
Hallway, lobby, playground.

786
00:53:53.371 --> 00:53:54.450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about the wall?

787
00:53:54.531 --> 00:53:57.730
Eight-feet high. Cinder block.
No way through it.

788
00:53:57.811 --> 00:53:59.011
You go over or under.

789
00:53:59.371 --> 00:54:01.131
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.

790
00:54:01.251 --> 00:54:03.770
It's not.
Your real problem's the monkey.

791
00:54:05.011 --> 00:54:07.532
The monkey's the eye in the sky.

792
00:54:07.612 --> 00:54:09.131
He sees everything.

793
00:54:09.932 --> 00:54:11.293
Classrooms.

794
00:54:21.692 --> 00:54:23.012
Hallways.

795
00:54:31.613 --> 00:54:33.132
Even the playground.

796
00:54:40.733 --> 00:54:44.333
You can unlock doors,
sneak past guards, climb the wall,

797
00:54:44.894 --> 00:54:47.894
but if you don't take out that monkey,
you ain't going nowhere.

798
00:54:48.494 --> 00:54:51.533
You wanna get out of here?
Get rid of that monkey!

799
00:54:52.694 --> 00:54:54.574
Recess! Come on, kids!

800
00:55:00.694 --> 00:55:01.775
Hey, guys.

801
00:55:02.735 --> 00:55:04.174
- Woody?
- Woody!

802
00:55:04.574 --> 00:55:05.575
Woody!

803
00:55:06.054 --> 00:55:08.335
- Hey, hey, hey, buddy!
- Thank goodness!

804
00:55:08.414 --> 00:55:10.575
- You're alive!
- 'Course I'm alive!

805
00:55:11.735 --> 00:55:14.455
Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz?

806
00:55:14.535 --> 00:55:16.136
Lotso did something to him!

807
00:55:16.215 --> 00:55:18.255
He thinks he's a real
Space Ranger again.

808
00:55:18.336 --> 00:55:19.695
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

809
00:55:20.056 --> 00:55:21.616
Return of the astro-nut.

810
00:55:21.936 --> 00:55:26.256
Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy.
I was wrong.

811
00:55:26.576 --> 00:55:28.855
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.

812
00:55:28.935 --> 00:55:32.056
No, no, it's my fault
for leaving you guys.

813
00:55:32.136 --> 00:55:34.295
From now on, we stick together.

814
00:55:34.376 --> 00:55:36.056
But Andy's leavin' for college.

815
00:55:36.136 --> 00:55:37.936
College? Hog-tie the mailman!

816
00:55:38.016 --> 00:55:40.537
We gotta get you home
before Andy leaves tomorrow!

817
00:55:40.616 --> 00:55:42.098
Tomorrow? But that means...

818
00:55:42.177 --> 00:55:44.097
It means
we're busting out of here, tonight.

819
00:55:44.177 --> 00:55:46.897
- What? Impossible!
- But there's no way out of here!

820
00:55:47.297 --> 00:55:49.217
No, there is one way out.

821
00:55:49.738 --> 00:55:50.777
One way.

822
00:55:53.138 --> 00:55:54.978
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

823
00:56:00.458 --> 00:56:02.258
- Springy dog.
- Present.

824
00:56:02.858 --> 00:56:04.338
Green guys.

825
00:56:04.418 --> 00:56:06.458
- Cowgirl.
- Here.

826
00:56:06.898 --> 00:56:08.019
Horse.

827
00:56:09.098 --> 00:56:10.498
- Piggy bank.
- Yo.

828
00:56:11.058 --> 00:56:12.659
- Tyrannosaurus.
- Here.

829
00:56:13.298 --> 00:56:14.778
- Barbie.
- Here.

830
00:56:15.339 --> 00:56:16.659
Potato Head.

831
00:56:17.778 --> 00:56:19.099
Potato Head?

832
00:56:20.219 --> 00:56:22.899
Hey! Hey!
Tuberous root-man! Wake up!

833
00:56:23.859 --> 00:56:25.139
Impossible!

834
00:56:26.739 --> 00:56:27.739
Hey!

835
00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:42.459
Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head?

836
00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:45.021
That's Mr Potato Head to you,
smoothie.

837
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:48.661
Well, well, well. You're turning out to
be quite the troublemaker, aren't you?

838
00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.181
What did you think you were
gonna do? Waltz right out of here?

839
00:56:51.301 --> 00:56:54.101
Yeah, and I would've got away with it,
too, if it weren't for you meddling toys!

840
00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:55.540
You ascot-wearing pink-noser!

841
00:56:55.861 --> 00:56:57.901
You're not a toy! You're an accessory!

842
00:56:57.981 --> 00:57:00.061
You're a purse with legs.

843
00:57:00.141 --> 00:57:01.420
Take him back to the box.

844
00:57:01.742 --> 00:57:05.622
No! No, not the box! I'm sorry.
Ll didn't mean it! I like ascots.

845
00:57:05.941 --> 00:57:08.101
Really. No, no, no!

846
00:57:08.661 --> 00:57:09.621
Okay, check.

847
00:57:09.862 --> 00:57:13.662
Good work, Lightyear. All right,
resume your space-guy-thingy.

848
00:57:13.741 --> 00:57:16.022
Yes, sir, well-groomed man!

849
00:57:16.101 --> 00:57:18.102
Ken! Ken?

850
00:57:21.142 --> 00:57:22.422
What do you want?

851
00:57:22.502 --> 00:57:25.783
I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go
to the Butterfly Room. With you!

852
00:57:25.863 --> 00:57:27.582
Yeah, well, you should've
thought of that yesterday.

853
00:57:27.823 --> 00:57:29.022
I was wrong.

854
00:57:29.102 --> 00:57:32.102
I wanna be with you, Ken, I do.
In your Dream House.

855
00:57:32.183 --> 00:57:35.423
Please take me away from this!
Take me away!

856
00:57:36.823 --> 00:57:37.823
Darn it, Barbie!

857
00:57:38.263 --> 00:57:40.663
Okay, but things
are complicated around here.

858
00:57:40.783 --> 00:57:43.743
- You gotta do what I say.
- I will, Ken! I promise!

859
00:57:45.703 --> 00:57:48.384
Wait. I'll do anything!
I'll change your diapers!

860
00:58:33.466 --> 00:58:34.946
Go get the tape!

861
00:58:41.586 --> 00:58:43.986
And this is where the magic happens.

862
00:58:45.306 --> 00:58:46.586
Look at all your clothes!

863
00:58:46.667 --> 00:58:48.386
I can't believe
you never brought me up here!

864
00:58:48.786 --> 00:58:50.866
- Tennis whites? Mission to Mars!
- I know, I know, I know.

865
00:58:50.948 --> 00:58:52.587
Check this out! Kung fu fighting.

866
00:58:52.667 --> 00:58:55.707
Campus hero
with matching sports pennant, huh?

867
00:58:55.787 --> 00:58:58.267
Flower power! Oh, Ken!

868
00:58:59.627 --> 00:59:02.907
No one appreciates clothes
here, Barbie. No one.

869
00:59:03.627 --> 00:59:07.748
Ken, would you
model a few outfits for me?

870
00:59:08.268 --> 00:59:09.628
Just a few?

871
00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:40.109
Go get the key.

872
00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:42.669
Where is it, where is it?

873
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:44.590
Where's the key?
Where's the key? Bingo!

874
00:59:54.831 --> 00:59:56.631
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

875
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:59.511
I told you,
keep your hands off of my stuff!

876
00:59:59.871 --> 01:00:01.271
Make a move, porky!

877
01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:04.711
Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up!

878
01:00:06.871 --> 01:00:08.952
- Hey! Hey!
- Take that, walnut-brain.

879
01:00:09.031 --> 01:00:10.151
No wonder you're extinct.

880
01:00:10.912 --> 01:00:13.271
Hey, you can't hit each other.
That's my job!

881
01:00:17.032 --> 01:00:18.552
Help! Prison riot!

882
01:00:21.472 --> 01:00:22.952
Get the tortilla.

883
01:01:01.754 --> 01:01:03.194
- Ready?
- Ready.

884
01:01:10.874 --> 01:01:11.875
Barbie?

885
01:01:13.995 --> 01:01:16.595
No more games, Ken!
What did Lotso do to Buzz?

886
01:01:16.675 --> 01:01:17.835
And how do we switch him back?

887
01:01:17.915 --> 01:01:19.755
You can't make me talk. You can't!

888
01:01:21.435 --> 01:01:22.996
But I'd like to see you try.

889
01:02:12.597 --> 01:02:15.238
Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks.

890
01:02:16.198 --> 01:02:17.998
Barbie! Those were vintage!

891
01:02:18.077 --> 01:02:19.837
It's okay. All right, go ahead,
rip 'em, I don't care.

892
01:02:19.918 --> 01:02:21.358
They're a dime a dozen.

893
01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:22.718
Glitter tux.

894
01:02:24.238 --> 01:02:27.398
Who cares? Who cares?
Sequins are tacky. Who cares?

895
01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:29.599
A Nehru jacket.

896
01:02:29.959 --> 01:02:31.118
Barbie! Not the Nehru.

897
01:02:31.199 --> 01:02:33.799
This is from what, 19677?

898
01:02:33.879 --> 01:02:35.399
The groovy formal collection, yes!

899
01:02:35.679 --> 01:02:39.039
- What a shame.
- Oh, no, no, no! No!

900
01:02:39.359 --> 01:02:41.119
There's an instruction manual!

901
01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:44.400
Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode!

902
01:02:45.519 --> 01:02:47.159
Where's that manual?

903
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.080
I don't know why
this couldn't wait until morning, Ken,

904
01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.240
but here you go.

905
01:03:05.121 --> 01:03:07.281
What's takin' so doggone long?

906
01:03:11.361 --> 01:03:12.801
So how do we fix Buzz?

907
01:03:30.042 --> 01:03:31.402
What are you looking at, feathers?

908
01:03:33.602 --> 01:03:34.602
Hey!

909
01:03:40.003 --> 01:03:41.482
Yeah, fly away, you coward.

910
01:03:44.482 --> 01:03:46.403
Well, that's just great.

911
01:03:52.403 --> 01:03:53.644
Help! Prison riot!

912
01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:55.803
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Give it up. No one can hear you.

913
01:03:56.323 --> 01:03:59.163
<i>What?
- Said, "No one can hear you."</i>

914
01:03:59.883 --> 01:04:02.084
- What?
- He said, "No one can..."

915
01:04:02.164 --> 01:04:03.683
Shush! Will you be quiet?

916
01:04:04.205 --> 01:04:05.244
Woody! You're back!

917
01:04:09.004 --> 01:04:10.244
Stop him! Don't let him get out!

918
01:04:10.324 --> 01:04:13.205
Star Command! I've been
taken hostage by my own prisoners.

919
01:04:15.205 --> 01:04:16.925
Quick! Open his back.
There's a switch!

920
01:04:17.005 --> 01:04:18.484
Unhand me, Zurg scum!

921
01:04:18.725 --> 01:04:21.085
The Galactic Courts
will show you no mercy.

922
01:04:22.364 --> 01:04:24.565
It's not working. Why is it not working?
Where's the manual?

923
01:04:24.645 --> 01:04:27.085
Here we go! There should be
a little hole under the switch.

924
01:04:27.165 --> 01:04:29.724
- Little hole, got it!
- "To reset your Buzz Lightyear,

925
01:04:29.805 --> 01:04:31.806
- "insert paperclip..."
- Rex, use your finger!

926
01:04:31.886 --> 01:04:32.885
What?

927
01:04:33.606 --> 01:04:35.005
- Okay, now what?
- All right, let's see.

928
01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:38.206
"Caution. Do not hold button
for more than five seconds."

929
01:04:41.246 --> 01:04:42.525
It's not my fault!

930
01:04:48.367 --> 01:04:49.406
Star Log...

931
01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:51.806
I've awakened from hyper-sleep
on a strange planet.

932
01:04:51.886 --> 01:04:54.127
<i>- Now what did you do?
- Just did what you told me!</i>

933
01:04:54.207 --> 01:04:58.007
I'm surrounded by alien creatures
of unknown intent.

934
01:04:58.087 --> 01:04:59.086
Who goes there?

935
01:04:59.167 --> 01:05:00.167
Friend?

936
01:05:00.247 --> 01:05:01.247
Or foe?

937
01:05:01.767 --> 01:05:03.448
Amigos! We're all amigos.

938
01:05:05.088 --> 01:05:07.368
I must have crash-landed
and had my memory erased.

939
01:05:08.447 --> 01:05:10.407
Anyone seen my spaceship?

940
01:05:10.688 --> 01:05:11.887
We gotta switch him back.

941
01:05:11.967 --> 01:05:14.928
- Well, how do we do that?
- I don't know. That part's in Spanish.

942
01:05:15.847 --> 01:05:17.607
We don't have time for this.
Come on, El Buzzo.

943
01:05:17.688 --> 01:05:19.247
My spaceship?
You know where it is?

944
01:05:19.328 --> 01:05:20.368
Excellent!

945
01:05:21.728 --> 01:05:23.168
Good luck, cowboy.

946
01:05:28.848 --> 01:05:30.169
Here they come.

947
01:05:32.448 --> 01:05:33.889
Come on, Buzz!

948
01:05:35.609 --> 01:05:37.009
What took you so long?

949
01:05:37.089 --> 01:05:39.249
Things got complicated.
Where's Potato Head?

950
01:05:39.329 --> 01:05:40.649
We haven't seen him.

951
01:05:43.049 --> 01:05:44.089
Buzz.

952
01:05:46.689 --> 01:05:48.329
My desert flower!

953
01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:52.330
I have never seen true beauty
until this night!

954
01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:54.250
Did you fix Buzz?

955
01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:56.409
- Sort of.
- Behind you.

956
01:05:56.729 --> 01:05:57.970
Someone's coming.

957
01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:04.250
You would not believe
what I've been through tonight.

958
01:06:04.331 --> 01:06:05.970
Darling! Are you okay?

959
01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:08.491
I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible.

960
01:06:08.571 --> 01:06:11.530
You've lost weight. And so tall.

961
01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:15.531
You're a sight for detachable eyes.

962
01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:21.811
All clear.

963
01:06:25.292 --> 01:06:26.772
Come on. Come on.

964
01:06:28.812 --> 01:06:29.812
We're almost there.

965
01:06:34.412 --> 01:06:35.651
Back up. Back up!

966
01:06:42.092 --> 01:06:43.253
Come on.

967
01:07:47.935 --> 01:07:49.216
Come with me!

968
01:07:49.296 --> 01:07:51.456
I will show you
the wonders of the galaxy...

969
01:07:51.615 --> 01:07:54.617
and we shall vanquish
all evil with our love!

970
01:07:58.297 --> 01:07:59.337
Woody!

971
01:08:01.457 --> 01:08:03.017
Come on. We're almost there.

972
01:08:03.577 --> 01:08:04.738
The Cowboy!

973
01:08:11.577 --> 01:08:13.817
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.

974
01:08:16.378 --> 01:08:18.258
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

975
01:08:23.818 --> 01:08:24.817
It is open.

976
01:08:25.258 --> 01:08:26.979
Way to go, Buzz. Come on.

977
01:08:31.138 --> 01:08:34.138
- Is it safe?
- I guess I'll find out.

978
01:08:40.299 --> 01:08:42.139
- Woody? You okay?
- Yeah.

979
01:08:42.699 --> 01:08:45.019
Come on down. But not all at once.

980
01:08:45.098 --> 01:08:46.899
- What did he say?
- I think he said, "All at once."

981
01:08:46.979 --> 01:08:48.259
No. No. No, no, no, no, no!

982
01:08:48.339 --> 01:08:49.659
- Geronimo!
- Look out!

983
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:54.339
Thanks, Jess.

984
01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:55.900
Where's my spaceship?

985
01:08:55.979 --> 01:08:56.980
Almost there, guys.

986
01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:59.540
Slink, you think you can make it?

987
01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:02.740
Well, I might be old,
but I still got a spring in my step.

988
01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.860
- He did it!
- All right, Slinkykins.

989
01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:08.541
Okay, climb across.

990
01:09:11.501 --> 01:09:12.820
You lost, little doggie?

991
01:09:16.621 --> 01:09:18.901
Well, well. Look who's back.

992
01:09:26.742 --> 01:09:28.182
I'm sorry, cowboy.

993
01:09:29.741 --> 01:09:31.022
They broke me.

994
01:09:31.101 --> 01:09:33.702
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?

995
01:09:34.341 --> 01:09:36.342
He don't want you no more.

996
01:09:36.422 --> 01:09:37.542
- That's a lie.
- Is it?

997
01:09:38.062 --> 01:09:39.702
Tell me this, Sheriff.

998
01:09:39.782 --> 01:09:42.742
If your kid loves you so much,
why is he leaving?

999
01:09:43.223 --> 01:09:44.983
You think you're special, cowboy?

1000
01:09:45.342 --> 01:09:49.462
You're a piece of plastic.
You were made to be thrown away.

1001
01:09:50.903 --> 01:09:52.543
Speak of the devil.

1002
01:09:58.143 --> 01:10:01.263
Now, we need toys
in our Caterpillar Room

1003
01:10:01.343 --> 01:10:03.863
and you need to avoid that truck.

1004
01:10:03.944 --> 01:10:07.703
Why don't you come on back,
join our family again?

1005
01:10:07.784 --> 01:10:11.104
This isn't a family! It's a prison!
You're a liar and a bully!

1006
01:10:11.544 --> 01:10:15.344
And I'd rather rot in this dumpster
than join any family of yours!

1007
01:10:15.464 --> 01:10:19.025
Jessie's right! Authority should derive
from the consent of the governed,

1008
01:10:19.104 --> 01:10:20.345
not from the threat of force.

1009
01:10:21.624 --> 01:10:23.464
If that's what you want.

1010
01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:28.225
Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso.

1011
01:10:28.345 --> 01:10:32.344
She's a Barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.

1012
01:10:33.185 --> 01:10:34.424
Not to me, there's not.

1013
01:10:35.945 --> 01:10:38.426
Fine. Then why don't you join her!

1014
01:10:41.305 --> 01:10:42.626
Oh, Ken!

1015
01:10:42.706 --> 01:10:43.865
Everyone, listen!

1016
01:10:43.945 --> 01:10:47.146
Sunnyside could be cool and groovy
if we treated each other fair.

1017
01:10:47.625 --> 01:10:50.266
It's Lotso.
He's made us into a pyramid,

1018
01:10:50.346 --> 01:10:51.986
and he put himself on top!

1019
01:10:52.066 --> 01:10:53.946
Anyone concur with Ken?

1020
01:10:56.987 --> 01:10:59.546
I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.

1021
01:10:59.666 --> 01:11:04.106
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.
Chew on that when you're at the dump.

1022
01:11:04.186 --> 01:11:06.067
Wait! What about Daisy?

1023
01:11:08.227 --> 01:11:09.908
I don't know what you're talking about.

1024
01:11:09.987 --> 01:11:12.507
Daisy? You used to do
everything with her?

1025
01:11:12.587 --> 01:11:14.467
- Yeah? Then she threw us out.
- No.

1026
01:11:14.947 --> 01:11:17.227
- She lost you.
- She replaced us!

1027
01:11:17.307 --> 01:11:19.067
She replaced you.

1028
01:11:19.147 --> 01:11:20.867
And if you couldn't have her
then no one could.

1029
01:11:21.108 --> 01:11:23.428
You lied to Big Baby
and you've been lying ever since.

1030
01:11:24.828 --> 01:11:27.068
- Where'd you get that?
- She loved you, Lotso.

1031
01:11:27.148 --> 01:11:28.307
She never loved me.

1032
01:11:28.388 --> 01:11:30.148
As much as any kid ever loved a toy.

1033
01:11:34.309 --> 01:11:35.308
Mama.

1034
01:11:35.628 --> 01:11:38.068
What? You want your mommy back?

1035
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:40.828
She never loved you.
Don't be such a baby!

1036
01:11:44.069 --> 01:11:45.349
Push 'em in. All of 'em!

1037
01:11:46.389 --> 01:11:49.309
This is what happens
when you dummies try to think.

1038
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:53.789
We're all just trash, waiting to be
thrown away! That's all a toy is!

1039
01:11:55.469 --> 01:11:58.270
Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!

1040
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:02.710
No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait!

1041
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:07.791
- He's gone!
- Holy cow.

1042
01:12:12.670 --> 01:12:13.870
Come on. Hurry!

1043
01:12:20.552 --> 01:12:21.550
For crying out loud!

1044
01:12:21.631 --> 01:12:22.631
Cowboy, hurry!

1045
01:12:25.951 --> 01:12:26.951
Woody!

1046
01:12:31.231 --> 01:12:32.951
Oh, boy. Incoming!

1047
01:12:35.232 --> 01:12:36.231
Come on!

1048
01:12:37.632 --> 01:12:38.632
Barbie, no!

1049
01:12:43.072 --> 01:12:44.072
Woody!

1050
01:12:47.872 --> 01:12:48.992
No!

1051
01:12:53.232 --> 01:12:55.272
Can you hear me? Is everyone okay?

1052
01:12:55.352 --> 01:12:58.033
Of course not, you imbecile.
We're doomed!

1053
01:12:59.993 --> 01:13:01.394
Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.

1054
01:13:03.793 --> 01:13:05.713
We all here? Slinky? Rex?

1055
01:13:09.833 --> 01:13:11.753
Against the wall, everybody. Quick!

1056
01:13:11.834 --> 01:13:13.713
Miss! Where are you?!

1057
01:13:13.793 --> 01:13:14.753
Buzz!

1058
01:13:24.954 --> 01:13:25.955
They'll never make it!

1059
01:13:35.395 --> 01:13:36.396
Look out!

1060
01:13:40.995 --> 01:13:42.035
Buzz!

1061
01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:51.396
- Anyone see him?
- Over here, y'all. I found him.

1062
01:13:54.916 --> 01:13:56.435
Buzz, you okay?

1063
01:13:57.116 --> 01:13:59.476
Buzz! Buzz!

1064
01:14:09.516 --> 01:14:10.556
That wasn't me, was it?

1065
01:14:10.677 --> 01:14:14.517
Buzz, you're back! You're back,
you're back, you're back, you're back!

1066
01:14:14.597 --> 01:14:17.037
Yes, I'm back. Where have I been?

1067
01:14:17.398 --> 01:14:19.278
Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.

1068
01:14:19.517 --> 01:14:22.397
Woody! So where are we now?

1069
01:14:22.637 --> 01:14:24.837
In a garbage truck
on the way to the dump!

1070
01:14:37.559 --> 01:14:39.479
Hold on, we're going in!

1071
01:14:54.359 --> 01:14:55.799
You got all your pieces?

1072
01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.399
The claw!

1073
01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.839
- My babies!
- Hey, guys! No! No!

1074
01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.200
No!

1075
01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.760
Hang on!

1076
01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.721
Woody! What do we do?

1077
01:15:24.801 --> 01:15:26.441
We'll be okay if we stay togeth...

1078
01:15:27.681 --> 01:15:29.242
- Woody!
- Slinky!

1079
01:15:30.721 --> 01:15:32.641
It's a magnet! Watch out!

1080
01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:35.402
Don't worry, Slink, we'll get you down.

1081
01:15:35.481 --> 01:15:37.082
You might wanna take a look at this.

1082
01:15:40.962 --> 01:15:42.442
Quick! Grab something metal!

1083
01:15:47.521 --> 01:15:48.842
You heard the guy.

1084
01:15:52.602 --> 01:15:54.282
It's not working!

1085
01:15:57.802 --> 01:16:00.843
Help! Help me. I'm stuck!

1086
01:16:01.203 --> 01:16:03.603
Help, please! Help!

1087
01:16:04.363 --> 01:16:05.363
Woody!

1088
01:16:07.842 --> 01:16:09.443
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.

1089
01:16:12.243 --> 01:16:13.243
Woody!

1090
01:16:22.604 --> 01:16:23.684
Go, go!

1091
01:16:29.444 --> 01:16:30.764
Thank you, Sheriff.

1092
01:16:30.845 --> 01:16:32.004
We're all in this together.

1093
01:16:32.285 --> 01:16:33.364
Right, guys?

1094
01:16:34.765 --> 01:16:35.764
Guys?

1095
01:16:36.045 --> 01:16:38.125
Woody! Down here!

1096
01:16:40.685 --> 01:16:42.605
- Woody!
- Oh, boy.

1097
01:16:44.565 --> 01:16:46.764
Woody, look. I can see daylight.

1098
01:16:46.845 --> 01:16:48.525
We're gonna be okay!

1099
01:16:49.326 --> 01:16:50.365
Hey!

1100
01:16:51.045 --> 01:16:52.606
I don't think that's daylight.

1101
01:16:58.606 --> 01:16:59.766
Run!

1102
01:17:15.726 --> 01:17:18.848
Sheriff! The button! Help me!

1103
01:17:18.927 --> 01:17:19.927
Come on!

1104
01:17:22.007 --> 01:17:23.967
Go. Go! Hit the button!

1105
01:17:31.247 --> 01:17:32.327
Hurry!

1106
01:17:35.449 --> 01:17:37.888
- Just push it! Push it!
- Push it!

1107
01:17:38.928 --> 01:17:41.209
Where's your kid now, Sheriff?

1108
01:17:41.728 --> 01:17:42.809
No. No!

1109
01:17:43.008 --> 01:17:44.008
Lotso!

1110
01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:47.329
No!

1111
01:18:03.810 --> 01:18:04.809
Rex!

1112
01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:12.611
Buzz! What do we do?

1113
01:19:29.733 --> 01:19:31.454
The claw.

1114
01:19:58.216 --> 01:20:01.015
You know all that bad stuff I said
about Andy's attic?

1115
01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.296
I take it all back.

1116
01:20:02.576 --> 01:20:04.256
- You're darn tootin'.
- You said it.

1117
01:20:10.376 --> 01:20:13.097
Oh, darling. You were so brave.

1118
01:20:14.537 --> 01:20:17.776
- You saved our lives.
- And we are eternally grateful.

1119
01:20:19.057 --> 01:20:20.337
My boys!

1120
01:20:20.417 --> 01:20:21.576
Daddy!

1121
01:20:21.977 --> 01:20:24.017
Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso?

1122
01:20:24.097 --> 01:20:26.017
Yeah. I'd like to loosen his stitchin'.

1123
01:20:26.297 --> 01:20:28.737
Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.

1124
01:20:37.737 --> 01:20:39.178
- Hey!
- What you got?

1125
01:20:39.258 --> 01:20:41.778
I had me one of these when I was a kid.

1126
01:20:42.538 --> 01:20:43.937
Strawberries.

1127
01:20:47.819 --> 01:20:50.898
Hey, buddy. You might wanna
keep your mouth shut.

1128
01:20:56.779 --> 01:20:59.139
Come on, Woody.
We gotta get you home.

1129
01:20:59.219 --> 01:21:01.539
- That's right, college boy.
- Wait.

1130
01:21:02.379 --> 01:21:03.579
What about you guys? I mean,

1131
01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:07.099
maybe the attic's not such a great idea.

1132
01:21:07.499 --> 01:21:11.940
- We're Andy's toys, Woody.
- We'll be there for him, together.

1133
01:21:13.659 --> 01:21:15.860
<i>- Just hope he hasn't left yet.
- Wait a minute!</i>

1134
01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:17.580
Wait, I'll check!

1135
01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:21.461
Andy's still packing.
But he's almost done!

1136
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:25.180
- He lives halfway across town.
- We'll never get there in time!

1137
01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:42.621
- Come on, Buster.
- Is that it, honey? You got everything?

1138
01:21:42.701 --> 01:21:44.342
Yeah. Just a few more boxes
in my room.

1139
01:21:44.421 --> 01:21:45.422
Okay. Come on.

1140
01:21:48.781 --> 01:21:49.982
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough!

1141
01:21:50.061 --> 01:21:51.902
All right. Go. Go, go!

1142
01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:01.222
Okay. All clear.

1143
01:22:09.663 --> 01:22:11.103
There you are.

1144
01:22:16.984 --> 01:22:18.703
- There you go.
- Buzz.

1145
01:22:21.983 --> 01:22:25.823
- This isn't goodbye.
- Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.

1146
01:22:26.144 --> 01:22:27.704
Yeah, but not too much fun.

1147
01:22:29.184 --> 01:22:31.744
- Woody, take care of Andy.
- Yeah.

1148
01:22:31.825 --> 01:22:34.304
He's a good kid.
Tell him to get a haircut.

1149
01:22:35.104 --> 01:22:36.104
Sure thing.

1150
01:22:37.305 --> 01:22:39.984
Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic?

1151
01:22:40.384 --> 01:22:43.384
<i>'Course I will. Besides, I know about</i>

1152
01:22:43.465 --> 01:22:45.945
- Buzz's Spanish mode.
- My what?

1153
01:22:46.024 --> 01:22:47.784
Honey, you want some food
for the road?

1154
01:22:47.865 --> 01:22:49.385
I'll get something on the way.

1155
01:22:50.505 --> 01:22:51.864
You know where to find us, cowboy.

1156
01:23:06.386 --> 01:23:07.746
Did you say goodbye to Molly?

1157
01:23:07.826 --> 01:23:10.306
Mom, we've said goodbye like 10 times.

1158
01:23:13.866 --> 01:23:15.106
Andy.

1159
01:23:21.867 --> 01:23:23.907
Mom, it's okay.

1160
01:23:25.507 --> 01:23:27.387
I know. It's just...

1161
01:23:30.266 --> 01:23:32.626
I wish I could always be with you.

1162
01:23:34.787 --> 01:23:36.388
You will be, Mom.

1163
01:23:51.309 --> 01:23:53.188
Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye
to Buster?

1164
01:23:53.269 --> 01:23:55.349
Of course I am. Who's a good doggy?

1165
01:23:55.429 --> 01:23:58.188
Who's a good doggy? I'm gonna
miss you. I'm gonna miss you.

1166
01:24:02.228 --> 01:24:05.629
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Don't, Andy.

1167
01:24:07.149 --> 01:24:11.590
Good boy.
He's telling you to go already.

1168
01:24:11.670 --> 01:24:12.789
Come on. Get the rest of your things.

1169
01:24:13.149 --> 01:24:16.229
Okay, Buster.
Now don't let Molly near my stuff.

1170
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:23.510
Hey.

1171
01:24:30.191 --> 01:24:33.991
Hey, Mom! So, you really think
ll should donate these?

1172
01:24:34.351 --> 01:24:37.190
It's up to you, honey.
Whatever you wanna do.

1173
01:25:03.872 --> 01:25:06.632
"Don't go in there!
The bakery is haunted!"

1174
01:25:06.712 --> 01:25:09.832
"Are you crazy?
You'll wake up all the ghosts."

1175
01:25:09.913 --> 01:25:12.273
"Look out!
The ghosts are throwing pies!"

1176
01:25:14.633 --> 01:25:15.632
Mom.

1177
01:25:16.553 --> 01:25:17.913
- Andy"

1178
01:25:17.993 --> 01:25:19.712
Wow. Look at you.

1179
01:25:19.793 --> 01:25:21.593
Well, I hear you're off to college.

1180
01:25:21.673 --> 01:25:23.473
Yeah. Right now, actually.

1181
01:25:23.552 --> 01:25:25.593
So, what can we do for you?

1182
01:25:26.433 --> 01:25:27.794
I have some toys here.

1183
01:25:28.273 --> 01:25:29.794
You hear that, Bonnie?

1184
01:25:30.514 --> 01:25:32.233
So, you're Bonnie?

1185
01:25:33.354 --> 01:25:34.634
I'm Andy.

1186
01:25:35.274 --> 01:25:38.314
Someone told me
you're really good with toys.

1187
01:25:38.875 --> 01:25:42.034
These are mine,
but I'm going away now,

1188
01:25:42.954 --> 01:25:44.994
so I need someone really special
to play with them.

1189
01:25:52.954 --> 01:25:55.915
This is Jessie, the roughest,
toughest cowgirl in the whole West.

1190
01:25:56.515 --> 01:26:00.235
She loves critters, but none more
than her best pal, Bullseye.

1191
01:26:03.235 --> 01:26:04.235
Here.

1192
01:26:17.195 --> 01:26:21.716
This is Rex, the meanest,
most terrifying dinosaur who ever lived!

1193
01:26:27.437 --> 01:26:31.317
The Potato Heads. Mr and Mrs.
You gotta keep 'em together,

1194
01:26:31.596 --> 01:26:33.517
'cause they're madly in love.

1195
01:26:33.916 --> 01:26:37.437
Now Slinky here is
as loyal as any dog you could want.

1196
01:26:37.517 --> 01:26:40.198
And Hamm,
he'll keep your money safe,

1197
01:26:40.637 --> 01:26:45.279
but he's also one of the most dastardly
villains of all time, evil Dr Pork Chop.

1198
01:26:48.438 --> 01:26:51.238
These little dudes
are from a strange alien world.

1199
01:26:51.638 --> 01:26:52.919
Pizza Planet.

1200
01:26:54.517 --> 01:26:55.758
And this

1201
01:26:58.078 --> 01:27:01.278
is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever!

1202
01:27:01.678 --> 01:27:04.319
Look, he can fly and shoot lasers!

1203
01:27:04.839 --> 01:27:07.919
He's sworn to protect the galaxy
from the evil Emperor Zurg.

1204
01:27:09.719 --> 01:27:12.079
To infinity and beyond!

1205
01:27:13.319 --> 01:27:16.039
Now, you gotta promise
to take good care of these guys.

1206
01:27:18.119 --> 01:27:21.600
They mean a lot to me.

1207
01:27:27.279 --> 01:27:28.560
My cowboy!

1208
01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.320
Woody? What's he doing in there?

1209
01:27:35.441 --> 01:27:37.960
- "There's a snake in my boot."
- Wha...?

1210
01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.960
There's a snake in my boot.

1211
01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:59.602
Now, Woody, he's been my pal
for as long as I can remember.

1212
01:28:00.802 --> 01:28:03.242
He's brave, like a cowboy should be.

1213
01:28:03.922 --> 01:28:05.202
And kind. And smart.

1214
01:28:06.761 --> 01:28:10.882
But the thing that makes Woody special
is he'll never give up on you.

1215
01:28:12.202 --> 01:28:13.282
Ever.

1216
01:28:14.162 --> 01:28:16.723
He'll be there for you, no matter what.

1217
01:28:20.403 --> 01:28:23.122
You think you can
take care of him for me?

1218
01:28:24.083 --> 01:28:25.123
Okay then.

1219
01:28:35.924 --> 01:28:39.324
Oh, no! Dr Pork Chop's attacking
the haunted bakery!

1220
01:28:39.403 --> 01:28:42.004
The ghosts are getting away.
Woody'll stop 'em!

1221
01:28:42.084 --> 01:28:43.564
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1222
01:28:44.644 --> 01:28:46.324
And we'll actually need the rocket.

1223
01:28:46.724 --> 01:28:49.164
They're getting away!
Come on, Bullseye!

1224
01:28:51.604 --> 01:28:55.005
We need to get in the spaceship.
The volcano is gonna erupt.

1225
01:28:55.085 --> 01:28:57.804
Look! They're being attacked
by a real dog!

1226
01:28:57.885 --> 01:28:59.205
You can eat my poisonous scones!

1227
01:28:59.285 --> 01:29:01.365
Mr and Mrs Potato Head
are in trouble.

1228
01:29:01.445 --> 01:29:02.885
Get on, Woody.

1229
01:29:04.645 --> 01:29:06.246
It's my friend Woody.

1230
01:29:07.045 --> 01:29:09.766
Buzz, hurry!
Get your extra turbo booster.

1231
01:29:36.087 --> 01:29:37.528
Thanks, guys.

1232
01:29:41.407 --> 01:29:43.848
Look, Mommy.
They're all playing together.

1233
01:29:43.927 --> 01:29:45.328
Come on. Let's get some lunch.

1234
01:29:58.968 --> 01:30:00.569
So long, partner.

1235
01:30:05.329 --> 01:30:08.568
Hey, Buzz. You haven't met
Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here.

1236
01:30:08.649 --> 01:30:11.249
You're gonna love them.
Buzz, this is Dolly.

1237
01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:41.810
New toys!

1238
01:30:53.731 --> 01:30:54.851
Noses.

1239
01:32:10.735 --> 01:32:14.856
"So I guess you could say
Sunnyside is sunny once again!

1240
01:32:14.976 --> 01:32:18.295
"Hope to hear from you soon. We're all
super excited about your new home.

1241
01:32:18.375 --> 01:32:20.856
"Hugs and kisses to everyone."

1242
01:32:22.696 --> 01:32:24.857
That Barbie has some nice handwriting.

1243
01:32:25.496 --> 01:32:28.176
Buzz, Barbie didn't write this.

1244
01:32:30.617 --> 01:32:31.736
- Grab the sword!
- I got it!

1245
01:32:31.817 --> 01:32:32.937
- Okay, go for the...
- Triple bonus!

1246
01:32:33.016 --> 01:32:34.096
- Watch out!
- We got the cloak of darkness!

1247
01:32:34.177 --> 01:32:36.777
- Run, run!
- My arms are never long enough!

1248
01:32:36.856 --> 01:32:39.137
I'll do it! This is it! This is it!

1249
01:32:39.737 --> 01:32:41.257
- Yes!
- We did it!

1250
01:32:41.337 --> 01:32:43.218
High-five! Hold on.

1251
01:32:45.617 --> 01:32:48.497
Well, it's official.
You guys made the wall.

1252
01:32:48.578 --> 01:32:51.497
- Look at this!
- Golly bob howdy! That's me!

1253
01:32:51.577 --> 01:32:54.777
We're all up here!
Hey, Chuckles, lookin' good.

1254
01:32:54.858 --> 01:32:57.058
Yeah, she really got your smile.

1255
01:33:04.098 --> 01:33:05.459
What the...

1256
01:33:07.258 --> 01:33:09.979
I told you kids! Stay out of my butt!

1257
01:33:10.978 --> 01:33:14.299
But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

1258
01:33:14.619 --> 01:33:17.818
Romeo, o Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

1259
01:33:18.379 --> 01:33:20.379
Next season, we're doing Cats.

1260
01:33:20.459 --> 01:33:22.979
Or might I suggest Hamlet?

1261
01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:26.779
Yeah. Detached wing.
Cosmetic damage.

1262
01:33:27.099 --> 01:33:29.339
Nothing a little duct tape can't fix.

1263
01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:41.700
I don't know what came over me.

1264
01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.580
Just go with it, Buzz.
