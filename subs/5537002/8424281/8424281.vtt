1
00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:04.064
Tomorrow we will bury
this one

2
00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:10.696
This Pipe Person.

3
00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:18.787
Our messenger to Wah-kon-tah.

4
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.085
It is time to bury this Pipe
with dignity...

5
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:29.506
...and put away its teachings.

6
00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:33.385
The children outside listening...

7
00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:37.848
...they will learn another language.

8
00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.519
They will be taught by white people.

9
00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:50.068
They will learn new ways...

10
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:55.073
...and will not know our ways.

11
00:05:14.398 --> 00:05:16.567
Phillips Oil workmen, right here.

12
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.529
-Kraceon Oil pipeline crew, over here.
-Burbank Oil Field, over here.

13
00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:23.240
-Marland Oil!
-Rock hounds for Phillips Oil, this truck.

14
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.200
Make it rich. You can make it rich.

15
00:05:25.284 --> 00:05:29.288
Make it rich. You can make it rich.
Make it rich. Right here.

16
00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.348
Phillips Oil workmen!

17
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.454
Ernest!

18
00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:12.289
Yeah.

19
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.957
-Ernest Burkhart? Henry.
-Yeah.

20
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.042
Henry Roan.

21
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.044
-I'm taking you to your uncle Hale.
-All right.

22
00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.629
Come on. Let's go. This is us, right here.

23
00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:19.963
Come on, stop!

24
00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:55.457
Whose land is this, Henry?

25
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:57.793
My land.

26
00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:00.170
My land.

27
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.952
Well, well, well.
Our war hero has arrived.

28
00:07:33.537 --> 00:07:35.873
Welcome home, Ernest. Welcome home.

29
00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:37.708
It's so good to see you again.

30
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.501
I'm so glad you made it.

31
00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:40.669
Brother.

32
00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:43.797
-Thanks for writin', huh?
-Good to have you back, Brother.

33
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:46.925
Ernest, now, here's your aunt Myrtle
and your cousin, little Willie.

34
00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:48.385
-Welcome.
-It's so good to see you.

35
00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.137
Look how big she's grown.
Isn't that something?

36
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.565
Now, this is a cattle ranch.
There's no oil here.

37
00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:06.612
No oil? Yeah. No oil, no fear,
so I'm settled with no fear.

38
00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:10.657
Time will run out.
This wealth will run dry,

39
00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:14.494
drier than the seven years of famine
that plagued the pharaohs of old.

40
00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.830
They're a sick people.

41
00:08:16.914 --> 00:08:20.083
They're kindly people,
big-hearted people, but they're sickly.

42
00:08:22.044 --> 00:08:24.671
What about you? You see bloodshed?

43
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:26.673
Some.

44
00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:31.929
Well, I was a--
I was a cook in the infantry.

45
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.723
You see Kelsie Morrison?
He was over there.

46
00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:35.807
-I did.
-Yeah.

47
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:39.102
Otis Griggs and the others,
if you remember.

48
00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:42.898
Soldiers have to eat.
You fed the soldiers that won the war.

49
00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:46.693
Well, saw more die from the flu, but...

50
00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:49.029
So what happened to your stomach?

51
00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:52.824
My-- My gut, it burst.

52
00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:55.160
You almost lost your life.

53
00:08:55.244 --> 00:08:59.665
They gave me a belt
and told me not to do any heavy lifting.

54
00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:03.377
Well, you made a good choice
coming back here, 'cause here--

55
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.461
I know.

56
00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:06.588
Money flows freely here, now.

57
00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:10.008
Well, I do-- I do love that money, sir.

58
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.261
Don't call me "sir."

59
00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:16.598
You call me "Uncle," or call me "King,"
like you used to. Remember?

60
00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:18.267
-Call you "King"?
-Yeah.

61
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:21.520
King.

62
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.482
Now, you didn't pick up any disease
over there, did you?

63
00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:27.401
-No. No.
-Sure?

64
00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:30.070
I'm sure, sir. I'm sure.
Not that I know of.

65
00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:34.157
You keep that thing wrapped up over there?

66
00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:36.118
I did. I did.

67
00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.370
-As best you could.
-As best I could.

68
00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:41.373
Yeah.

69
00:09:42.875 --> 00:09:43.876
You like women?

70
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:48.505
You know I like women. That's my weakness.

71
00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:51.091
What kinds they got out there?

72
00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:53.969
Just white. Just white, that I saw.

73
00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:56.722
You like red?

74
00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:57.890
Red?

75
00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:00.392
You mean that kind of red?

76
00:10:01.977 --> 00:10:06.023
I like red. I like white. I like blue.
I like all of 'em.

77
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.525
Don't matter to me. I'm greedy.

78
00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:14.990
I like the heavy ones.
I like the heavy ones, pretty ones, soft,

79
00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:18.076
ones that smell good, you know.

80
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.997
Well, we gotta keep an eye on you.
You're all over the place.

81
00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:24.750
Speaking of that...

82
00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:27.044
Hey, Byron.

83
00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:31.298
Yeah.

84
00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.928
Oh, yeah, that's good. That's real good.

85
00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:39.014
Don't get played out in the open
with alcohol, you hear?

86
00:10:40.474 --> 00:10:42.184
'Cause then you'll cause trouble.

87
00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:44.978
-Right, Byron?
-That's right, King.

88
00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:48.232
No, sir. I won't. I won't.

89
00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:50.359
Now, most fellas out here are crooked.

90
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:55.072
Some do things right, most do bad,
so don't be simple.

91
00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:58.033
-No, sir. I won't.
-Don't make small trouble about nothing.

92
00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:02.371
You gonna make trouble, make it big.
Get a big payoff for that, you hear?

93
00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:03.956
Yes, sir.

94
00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:08.001
You see, I am officially
reserve deputy sheriff in Fairfax.

95
00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.548
I don't want to bring unwanted eyes.

96
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:14.633
-I won't find that trouble.
-Yeah.

97
00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.093
I won't do stupid things.

98
00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.679
And you got your head on straight
after being over there?

99
00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:23.684
Course I do. I'm not thick, sir.
I'm strong.

100
00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:27.729
Well, I got a place I'm gonna put you.
That'll be driving.

101
00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.732
'Cause you can't do much else
'cause of your gut.

102
00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:33.151
You don't read much, do you?

103
00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:34.862
Read?

104
00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:36.530
Do you read, yeah. Read much?

105
00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:38.824
Well, I can read.

106
00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:43.328
Well, you smarten yourself up.
Get him that book on the Osage, Byron.

107
00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:44.872
-This one?
-Yeah, that one.

108
00:11:45.873 --> 00:11:48.250
-You smarten yourself up.
-I can read, sir.

109
00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:54.339
The Osage.
They have the worst land possible,

110
00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:58.927
but the good Lord,
he outsmarted everybody.

111
00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:02.139
The land had oil on it. Black gold.

112
00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:05.184
But they're wise people.

113
00:12:05.267 --> 00:12:11.398
They worked it so as they had the say
who gets the oil, who gets the headrights.

114
00:12:12.316 --> 00:12:13.734
The Osage are sharp.

115
00:12:15.986 --> 00:12:18.614
They don't talk much,
so that might make you feel

116
00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:20.699
like you've got to run your mouth
to fill the space,

117
00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:22.367
especially you been drinking.

118
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:26.205
Better you be quiet
if you don't got nothing smart to say.

119
00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:27.873
Don't get caught on that.

120
00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:30.375
It's what they call, "blackbird talk."

121
00:12:37.049 --> 00:12:38.258
Blackbird talk.

122
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.848
Just 'cause they're not talking,

123
00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:47.518
don't mean they don't know
everything about everything.

124
00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:52.481
Yeah, Osage are the finest
and most beautiful people on God's earth.

125
00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:16.129
John Whitehair, age 23.

126
00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:21.134
No investigation.

127
00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:26.598
Bill Stepson, age 29.

128
00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.061
No investigation.

129
00:13:35.524 --> 00:13:38.443
Anna Sanford, age 41.

130
00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.949
No investigation.

131
00:13:46.702 --> 00:13:47.786
Rose Lewis...

132
00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:52.457
age 25.

133
00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:58.005
No investigation.

134
00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:05.345
There we go.

135
00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:24.114
And Sara Butler, age 21.

136
00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.658
Suicide.

137
00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:30.495
State your name.

138
00:14:31.288 --> 00:14:34.750
I'm Mollie Kyle. Incompetent.

139
00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:37.294
What is your allotment number?

140
00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:38.629
Two hundred eighty-five.

141
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:44.134
You've asked for additional moneys of $752

142
00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:47.095
to pay a medical bill for an abscess.

143
00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:49.014
Yes, sir.

144
00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:51.725
Was the operation successful?

145
00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:53.936
Yes, sir.

146
00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:55.896
And the diabetes?

147
00:14:56.438 --> 00:15:01.109
I have a prescription at Fairfax Drugs.
I'll send my help to fill twice monthly.

148
00:15:01.193 --> 00:15:03.570
You gotta look out for that, you know.

149
00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:09.284
Now, Mollie, it's your mother.

150
00:15:09.368 --> 00:15:14.414
You know she's restricted too,
so we have to account for every penny.

151
00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:22.089
It says here she spent $319 and 05 cents
for meat

152
00:15:23.382 --> 00:15:24.883
at the grocery.

153
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:29.930
Don't you think that's an awful lot
of meat for what she needs?

154
00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:33.267
Yes, Mr. Beaty.

155
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.728
Well, you'll look after that, won't you?

156
00:15:39.273 --> 00:15:40.274
Yes.

157
00:15:44.528 --> 00:15:47.781
All right, people. Let's form a line here
for allotment payments.

158
00:15:48.282 --> 00:15:50.200
Unrestricted only.

159
00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:54.746
Restricted, take your guardian.
He has to be with you to sign your checks.

160
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.875
You need to find your guardian.
Nothing new this time, folks.

161
00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.002
Thirty-dollar photo for posterity.

162
00:16:00.085 --> 00:16:02.421
Don't you wanna preserve
your family history? Come on.

163
00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:04.548
-How about you, sir? You--
-Now, don't go after him.

164
00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:06.925
He don't know nothing. He's an amateur.

165
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:10.304
You need a proper photo
for you and your family.

166
00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:13.765
For you, sir? $40. For you, sir? $40.

167
00:16:13.849 --> 00:16:15.017
-How much? $40?
-$40.

168
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.519
All right.
I got $35 cash for you right now.

169
00:16:17.603 --> 00:16:19.396
-Take it or leave it.
-Thirty-five's a deal.

170
00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:20.814
Let's have it, get it done.

171
00:16:20.898 --> 00:16:24.067
Y'all are gonna make a pretty picture.
Y'all, come on this way, over here.

172
00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:40.709
My wife's been feeling poorly.
The doctor says it's her constitution.

173
00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.211
The boy's got asthma.

174
00:16:42.294 --> 00:16:45.172
His asthma's holding him back.
He just needs a chance.

175
00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:47.925
You've got your checks.
You're unrestricted. Please.

176
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.349
We'll take one. In that color.

177
00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:58.852
Thank you. Thank you!

178
00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:01.480
I'll tell you what, you run out of gas,
you get a flat tire,

179
00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:03.315
you come right on back and buy another.

180
00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:26.755
Ma'am, you need a ride?
That's my bucket, right there.

181
00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:27.840
Thank you.

182
00:17:30.217 --> 00:17:33.220
Gotta be careful.
A lot of characters around here today.

183
00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:43.021
Hey, Ernest!

184
00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:44.773
Hey, Kelsie Morrison!

185
00:17:45.649 --> 00:17:47.860
-We were at the front together in France.
-Hey!

186
00:17:47.943 --> 00:17:51.029
-How you doing? Great to see you!
-You too. You too.

187
00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:52.447
My wife, Catherine Cole.

188
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:54.783
Oh, pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.

189
00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:55.909
Full blood.

190
00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:59.204
Sky People, right? Sky People?

191
00:17:59.288 --> 00:18:02.207
Middle Water. Middle Water.

192
00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:04.209
Lot of money on this.

193
00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:32.654
You got money on this race?

194
00:18:32.738 --> 00:18:33.947
No. No.

195
00:18:34.031 --> 00:18:35.199
Let's go, then.

196
00:18:36.575 --> 00:18:37.618
Yep.

197
00:18:57.763 --> 00:19:00.057
I'm sorry to hear she's not doing good.

198
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.226
You know, Father,
just as stubborn as ever.

199
00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:04.603
Tell your mom I'm praying for her, okay?

200
00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:06.396
-Take care. Yeah.
-Thank you, Father.

201
00:19:14.613 --> 00:19:17.449
You know who I mean
when I say Mollie Kyle?

202
00:19:17.533 --> 00:19:18.951
You know the one, with the sisters.

203
00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:22.538
-I know which one. Mollie.
-Yeah. Mollie.

204
00:19:22.621 --> 00:19:24.122
She lives with her mother, Lizzie.

205
00:19:25.249 --> 00:19:29.837
I know, Uncle, which one. I know her.
I've been driving her.

206
00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:31.880
-Driving her?
-Yeah.

207
00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.759
Matt Williams used to go with her
for a time.

208
00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:37.553
They're not together in a way now,

209
00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:39.221
so that means

210
00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:43.350
you could have a proposition with that
if that struck you.

211
00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:49.898
You want-- You want me to see after her.

212
00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:53.485
-She's a regular customer of mine.
-Yeah.

213
00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:56.113
I think she's sweet on me too.

214
00:19:58.115 --> 00:20:01.034
-That Mollie, she's easy to like. Yeah.
-Yeah.

215
00:20:01.118 --> 00:20:02.870
Full blood estate, at that, too.

216
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:07.124
-Full blood estate.
-Full blood estate.

217
00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:08.917
Now, that's something a man can work with.

218
00:20:16.884 --> 00:20:18.594
You got a good face, you know that?

219
00:20:21.263 --> 00:20:23.015
Think you can be the marrying kind?

220
00:20:24.141 --> 00:20:25.350
Marrying kind?

221
00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:27.936
How do you mean?

222
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.439
Well, we mix these families together,

223
00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:33.775
and that estate money flows
the right direction, it'll come to us.

224
00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:40.908
That's a full blood estate. And she gets
that money of the mother Lizzie.

225
00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:45.829
Now, that's good business there.
And legal, not against the law.

226
00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:47.915
That's smart investment.

227
00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:03.972
They told me you was going
with Matt Williams for a time.

228
00:21:07.184 --> 00:21:08.685
You talk too much.

229
00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:12.064
Nah. Nah, I don't talk too much.

230
00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:16.860
Just thinking who I gotta beat
in this horse race, that's all.

231
00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:20.739
I didn't realize this was a race.

232
00:21:23.242 --> 00:21:24.910
I don't care for watching horses.

233
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:28.664
Well, I'm a different kind of horse.

234
00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.880
What?

235
00:21:36.964 --> 00:21:38.549
What was that?

236
00:21:40.676 --> 00:21:42.427
That's how you are.

237
00:21:42.511 --> 00:21:46.390
I don't know what you said, but it
must've been Indian for "handsome devil."

238
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:00.571
All right.

239
00:22:16.253 --> 00:22:20.465
"I am an Osage brave.

240
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:28.307
A long time ago, we Osage took our name
from Missouri and Osage Rivers."

241
00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:34.021
"Ni-U-Kon-Ska,
Children of the Middle Waters.

242
00:22:34.938 --> 00:22:38.066
'Move,' said the Great White Father,

243
00:22:38.692 --> 00:22:43.238
from Missouri, from Arkansas, from Kansas.

244
00:22:43.947 --> 00:22:47.159
Finally, another strange land,

245
00:22:48.202 --> 00:22:54.750
Oklahoma, where famine walked by day
and hungry wolves by night.

246
00:22:56.210 --> 00:23:00.672
Can you find the wolves in this picture?"

247
00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:04.092
All right, let's go. Come on.

248
00:23:05.511 --> 00:23:10.557
"Osage weren't ever
part of the Five Civilized Tribes."

249
00:23:10.641 --> 00:23:12.309
You remember Blackie Thompson?

250
00:23:12.392 --> 00:23:13.393
Howdy, boys!

251
00:23:13.477 --> 00:23:19.441
"Of the Five Civilized Tribes,
the Cherokee, Chickasaw,

252
00:23:19.525 --> 00:23:23.987
Choctaw, Creek and Seminole."

253
00:23:25.989 --> 00:23:26.990
Don't move!

254
00:23:30.786 --> 00:23:33.413
That rock still shines in the dark, boys.
Give me that.

255
00:23:33.497 --> 00:23:36.375
Just take the car. Don't take my ring.
My father gave it to me.

256
00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:39.211
Don't want the car. Just want the jewels.

257
00:23:39.294 --> 00:23:41.338
Y'all didn't do nothing
to earn this anyway.

258
00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:44.508
-You like these?
-Got us some rich Indians, boys!

259
00:23:45.551 --> 00:23:46.969
Come on!

260
00:23:48.011 --> 00:23:49.012
Come on! Come on!

261
00:23:49.096 --> 00:23:50.472
I'm going all in, boys.

262
00:23:50.556 --> 00:23:52.015
What are you thinking, Ernest?

263
00:23:58.105 --> 00:23:59.356
No. That's crazy, Ernest!

264
00:23:59.439 --> 00:24:02.985
I love money. I love money!
Turn that card over! Boom!

265
00:24:03.068 --> 00:24:04.778
-Come on!
-Yeah! Do it! Hell yeah!

266
00:24:04.862 --> 00:24:05.988
Take a chance!

267
00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:11.159
-Fairfax horseshit right there, boy.
-Goddamn!

268
00:24:11.243 --> 00:24:13.537
-Queen gets the jewels.
-God! Shit!

269
00:24:15.998 --> 00:24:19.793
"Dawn was always a sacred time
for prayers.

270
00:24:27.968 --> 00:24:30.971
They call the sun 'Grandfather.'

271
00:24:32.055 --> 00:24:34.433
The moon, 'Mother.'

272
00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:38.187
Fire, 'Father.'

273
00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:41.523
They call it the 'Flower Moon'

274
00:24:41.607 --> 00:24:46.570
when tiny flowers spread
over the blackjack hills and the prairies.

275
00:24:47.112 --> 00:24:48.572
There are many.

276
00:24:48.655 --> 00:24:54.369
So many, it's as if Wah-kon-tah
looked down upon the earth,

277
00:24:54.453 --> 00:24:55.996
smiled,

278
00:24:56.079 --> 00:24:58.957
and sprinkled it with sugar candy.

279
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:05.422
Wah-kon-tah means 'God.'

280
00:25:07.049 --> 00:25:09.176
You're given your Osage name."

281
00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:12.095
Your name is Sun Hawk Woman.

282
00:25:12.513 --> 00:25:15.599
"It's how you will be called
to the next world.

283
00:25:17.142 --> 00:25:20.187
Your Osage name
can never be taken away from you."

284
00:25:44.044 --> 00:25:45.796
Here. Put this on.

285
00:25:58.559 --> 00:25:59.935
You want dinner?

286
00:26:02.771 --> 00:26:03.772
Yeah.

287
00:26:38.348 --> 00:26:39.766
Don't you want a bite of this?

288
00:26:40.601 --> 00:26:42.060
I got too much sugar.

289
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.067
Can never be too sweet, now, can you?

290
00:26:50.819 --> 00:26:52.279
It makes me sickly.

291
00:27:04.249 --> 00:27:06.835
You live in this house
just with your mother?

292
00:27:08.128 --> 00:27:09.546
I take care for her.

293
00:27:11.465 --> 00:27:12.966
And you live with your uncle?

294
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.177
Yes. Yes. You know him?

295
00:27:15.928 --> 00:27:17.179
Since I can remember.

296
00:27:18.096 --> 00:27:19.473
He's a nice man.

297
00:27:27.648 --> 00:27:29.274
Why did you come here?

298
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.943
For what?

299
00:27:32.319 --> 00:27:33.487
To live here.

300
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.447
Yes. I live here.

301
00:27:38.158 --> 00:27:39.159
Why?

302
00:27:41.537 --> 00:27:44.498
For my uncle. I work with him.

303
00:27:48.961 --> 00:27:52.214
And your brother is Bryan?

304
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.883
-Byron, that's right.
-Byron.

305
00:27:57.719 --> 00:27:58.720
You scared of him?

306
00:28:00.097 --> 00:28:02.432
My brother? Who?

307
00:28:02.516 --> 00:28:03.559
Your uncle.

308
00:28:06.979 --> 00:28:08.647
Well, no.

309
00:28:10.107 --> 00:28:13.861
No, he's the king of the Osage Hills.

310
00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.155
He's the nicest man in the world.

311
00:28:17.239 --> 00:28:19.700
I know if you cross him what he could do.

312
00:28:20.701 --> 00:28:23.954
No, I'm my own man. I do my own work.

313
00:28:25.247 --> 00:28:26.790
I'm a businessman.

314
00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:28.917
Yeah, thanks.

315
00:28:30.836 --> 00:28:31.962
Here you go.

316
00:28:41.263 --> 00:28:42.890
What's your religion?

317
00:28:44.266 --> 00:28:45.475
Catholic.

318
00:28:48.061 --> 00:28:49.563
You don't come to church.

319
00:28:50.314 --> 00:28:52.524
Oh, yes, I've been away.

320
00:29:00.324 --> 00:29:02.117
How come you don't have a husband?

321
00:29:05.412 --> 00:29:09.208
I'm a man, and I want to know why
a woman like you doesn't have a husband.

322
00:29:17.424 --> 00:29:19.843
You know, you got nice color skin.

323
00:29:22.554 --> 00:29:24.348
What color would you say that is?

324
00:29:27.768 --> 00:29:28.852
My color.

325
00:29:31.396 --> 00:29:34.608
Well, I think it's real pretty.

326
00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:41.073
You got nice color skin.
You got a nice house.

327
00:29:43.158 --> 00:29:45.577
I think you just pretend to be so severe.

328
00:29:45.661 --> 00:29:48.872
Bet you-- I bet you got a soft belly
on the inside there.

329
00:29:52.042 --> 00:29:54.837
You just called me a coyote, didn't you?

330
00:29:57.548 --> 00:29:58.674
Coyote.

331
00:29:59.675 --> 00:30:01.552
Coyote wants money.

332
00:30:03.846 --> 00:30:06.098
Well, that money's real nice.

333
00:30:06.181 --> 00:30:09.393
It's real nice,
especially if you're lazy like me.

334
00:30:10.978 --> 00:30:14.356
I mean, I wanna sleep all day,
and I wanna make a party when it's dark.

335
00:30:19.069 --> 00:30:20.571
What's so funny?

336
00:30:21.989 --> 00:30:23.282
You like peh-tseh nee?

337
00:30:24.324 --> 00:30:25.367
Whiskey.

338
00:30:27.327 --> 00:30:29.454
I don't like whiskey, I love whiskey.

339
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.710
I have good whiskey, not bad whiskey.

340
00:30:36.461 --> 00:30:38.714
I think we should try some and find out.

341
00:30:53.312 --> 00:30:55.898
No, no. No. No, don't close it.

342
00:30:57.774 --> 00:30:59.067
What?

343
00:31:00.611 --> 00:31:02.237
We need to be quiet for a while.

344
00:31:22.466 --> 00:31:24.009
The storm, it's...

345
00:31:27.554 --> 00:31:29.431
Well, it's powerful.

346
00:31:30.849 --> 00:31:32.684
So we need to be quiet for a while.

347
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.695
-It's good for the crops, that's for sure.
-Just be still.

348
00:32:14.852 --> 00:32:15.853
Bill Smith.

349
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.481
Bill Smith.

350
00:32:19.565 --> 00:32:22.192
-Ernest. Ernest Burkhart.
-Good to meet you, Ernest.

351
00:32:22.276 --> 00:32:23.861
I'm Minnie's husband.

352
00:33:07.738 --> 00:33:10.365
It might make you feel a little better
if you eat something.

353
00:33:18.582 --> 00:33:19.875
No, not again.

354
00:33:19.958 --> 00:33:21.960
He's not that smart...

355
00:33:22.836 --> 00:33:24.880
...but he's handsome.

356
00:33:26.006 --> 00:33:27.883
He looks like a snake.

357
00:33:28.592 --> 00:33:31.887
No, he looks like Coyote.

358
00:33:32.638 --> 00:33:34.515
Those Blue Eyes.

359
00:33:36.266 --> 00:33:40.270
His brother is handsome, too.
I like the brother more.

360
00:33:41.897 --> 00:33:43.982
That red haired rat?

361
00:33:45.859 --> 00:33:50.948
Better than your possum
playing dead...

362
00:33:51.365 --> 00:33:53.534
...and lazing around the house.

363
00:33:55.869 --> 00:33:57.287
He's a possum around you...

364
00:33:57.496 --> 00:33:59.706
...he's like a rabbit to me.

365
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:03.043
Be quiet...!

366
00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.379
...Coyote's watching.

367
00:34:07.297 --> 00:34:09.466
He wants our money.

368
00:34:10.968 --> 00:34:12.261
Of course he wants money...

369
00:34:12.678 --> 00:34:15.305
...but he wants to be settled.

370
00:34:17.724 --> 00:34:19.852
He's not restless.

371
00:34:20.519 --> 00:34:22.813
His Uncle has money...

372
00:34:22.938 --> 00:34:25.315
...it's not money he wants...

373
00:34:25.649 --> 00:34:27.025
...he loves you.

374
00:34:45.752 --> 00:34:47.045
Slow down.

375
00:34:54.136 --> 00:34:56.096
Your hand looks on my skin...

376
00:35:10.235 --> 00:35:12.279
You're gonna marry me, Mollie.

377
00:35:14.948 --> 00:35:16.366
I want you to be my wife.

378
00:35:19.328 --> 00:35:20.329
Will you do that?

379
00:35:32.299 --> 00:35:34.259
Can you stand her kind?

380
00:35:38.347 --> 00:35:40.390
I love this girl. Mollie.

381
00:35:41.266 --> 00:35:44.186
Uncle, I really do think she's a lady.

382
00:35:46.813 --> 00:35:48.982
Well, then you found a wife.

383
00:36:00.619 --> 00:36:01.912
Mollie.

384
00:36:03.247 --> 00:36:04.373
Ernest.

385
00:36:39.616 --> 00:36:43.412
I've known Mollie and her sisters since
they were little girls running around,

386
00:36:43.495 --> 00:36:44.913
making a lot of trouble.

387
00:36:47.583 --> 00:36:50.878
Mollie's dear departed father,
Nah-kah-e-se-y,

388
00:36:50.961 --> 00:36:54.339
was a dear, dear friend of mine,
a beloved friend of the heart.

389
00:36:54.423 --> 00:36:56.842
He always used to tell the white men
just to call him Jimmy,

390
00:36:56.925 --> 00:37:00.971
but I always called him
by his proper name, Nah-kah-e-se-y.

391
00:37:01.054 --> 00:37:03.056
We had great respect for each other.

392
00:37:50.854 --> 00:37:52.064
You and me.

393
00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.155
Keep going right. I'm going right.

394
00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:21.093
Minnie.

395
00:38:26.765 --> 00:38:29.142
What do you need for, Minnie?

396
00:38:29.226 --> 00:38:30.227
No, sir.

397
00:38:31.061 --> 00:38:32.771
You well taken care of?

398
00:38:35.274 --> 00:38:36.650
Yes.

399
00:38:40.153 --> 00:38:41.697
You have proper medicines?

400
00:38:43.156 --> 00:38:47.160
'Cause I want you to know
you have the best care if you need.

401
00:38:47.244 --> 00:38:48.829
I don't want you to be afraid.

402
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:57.296
So many troubles
that we've brought upon you, all of you.

403
00:38:57.963 --> 00:38:59.173
I'm so sorry.

404
00:39:00.215 --> 00:39:02.718
I'm so sorry.

405
00:39:42.132 --> 00:39:45.344
Minnie. My sister.

406
00:39:47.638 --> 00:39:48.972
Wasting illness.

407
00:40:12.246 --> 00:40:13.247
Anna.

408
00:40:27.469 --> 00:40:28.595
Ernest.

409
00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:29.680
Yeah?

410
00:40:30.305 --> 00:40:33.225
Ernest, it might be best
for you to sit outside.

411
00:40:33.976 --> 00:40:36.770
What-- Well, why's that?

412
00:40:38.146 --> 00:40:39.773
It's just the way this is going.

413
00:40:41.316 --> 00:40:42.484
If you don't mind.

414
00:40:47.281 --> 00:40:51.201
"The way this is going"?
You're saying you want me outside?

415
00:40:51.285 --> 00:40:52.661
Yes, sir, if you would.

416
00:40:56.498 --> 00:40:57.499
All right.

417
00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.548
Bill Smith.

418
00:41:07.009 --> 00:41:08.010
Yeah.

419
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.096
It shows itself to you

420
00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:15.267
that Bill Smith didn't take the proper
care of Minnie the way he could have.

421
00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:18.896
To have her sick and die,
take her headrights and her land?

422
00:41:20.939 --> 00:41:23.525
That oil, which should go to her sisters,
your wife,

423
00:41:23.609 --> 00:41:26.278
well, he's taking money that, by rights,
should go to Mollie.

424
00:41:29.781 --> 00:41:31.074
The mother, Lizzie.

425
00:41:37.331 --> 00:41:39.124
She's not in good shape.

426
00:41:39.666 --> 00:41:40.876
She won't last.

427
00:41:42.753 --> 00:41:45.088
Most Osage don't live past 50.

428
00:41:46.131 --> 00:41:49.551
With these women dying,
with how Osage suffer from illness,

429
00:41:49.635 --> 00:41:52.095
you have to make it
the headrights come to you.

430
00:41:53.764 --> 00:41:55.015
You see?

431
00:41:57.392 --> 00:41:58.560
Yeah.

432
00:41:58.644 --> 00:42:00.145
Minnie's gone now,

433
00:42:00.229 --> 00:42:02.147
and after her, that leaves...

434
00:42:02.648 --> 00:42:03.482
Reta...

435
00:42:04.858 --> 00:42:06.151
Anna,

436
00:42:07.027 --> 00:42:09.279
and then, of course, there's Mollie.

437
00:42:11.448 --> 00:42:12.616
Yeah.

438
00:42:14.409 --> 00:42:16.328
How's Mollie feeling?

439
00:42:16.411 --> 00:42:18.038
She's all right.

440
00:42:19.623 --> 00:42:21.250
Takes care of the little one.

441
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.631
-She's got the diabetes too.
-Yeah.

442
00:42:27.714 --> 00:42:33.011
I worry for her sometimes.
She's sick most days, King.

443
00:42:33.095 --> 00:42:37.099
Of course she is. How could she not be?
This diabetes is a trial to bear.

444
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:41.311
Like it says in the book of Job,

445
00:42:41.395 --> 00:42:44.356
the days of affliction
have taken hold upon her.

446
00:42:47.568 --> 00:42:51.864
Well, Mollie, she's still strong, King.
She's strong.

447
00:42:51.947 --> 00:42:55.617
Yeah, for now. We hope, forever, but...

448
00:42:58.871 --> 00:43:02.875
What about Anna?
You know Anna carries a gun in her purse?

449
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.252
Hey, what the hell?

450
00:43:05.335 --> 00:43:07.546
I know you get around--

451
00:43:09.006 --> 00:43:10.007
Shit!

452
00:43:10.799 --> 00:43:13.719
-What the hell?
-Fucking crazy squaw!

453
00:43:14.761 --> 00:43:16.263
Now, I love Anna,

454
00:43:16.889 --> 00:43:19.892
but she's gonna pick a fight one day
with the wrong person.

455
00:43:20.601 --> 00:43:21.602
And then what?

456
00:44:53.318 --> 00:44:55.571
-Hey. Stop it.
-Put it all on the table.

457
00:44:59.741 --> 00:45:04.955
-Stop it. Manners.
-Nobody's got any manners here.

458
00:45:05.747 --> 00:45:07.541
Did you see the Owl?

459
00:45:09.376 --> 00:45:10.252
No.

460
00:45:14.756 --> 00:45:16.842
When you do...

461
00:45:17.759 --> 00:45:21.680
...it's a sign that we are dying.

462
00:45:23.098 --> 00:45:24.558
Because... of you.

463
00:45:27.186 --> 00:45:29.855
You all marry white men.

464
00:45:31.899 --> 00:45:34.776
Our blood is getting white.

465
00:45:38.614 --> 00:45:40.741
Where's Anna?

466
00:45:41.825 --> 00:45:43.952
I want Anna.

467
00:45:44.244 --> 00:45:45.746
I'm here.

468
00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:48.207
I don't want you.

469
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:50.334
I want Anna.

470
00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:59.259
Let's get all of them.

471
00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.596
This one's whiter than that one.

472
00:46:03.347 --> 00:46:06.058
You'd never know this one's a half-breed,
would you?

473
00:46:06.141 --> 00:46:10.896
They're both a couple of little half-assed
savages, as far as I'm concerned.

474
00:46:10.979 --> 00:46:14.399
Bless their little hearts, now,
they can't help it.

475
00:46:15.609 --> 00:46:20.030
One dark and one light.
And it's like an eclipse.

476
00:46:20.697 --> 00:46:26.411
The Lord put his hand over the earth
and made it shake for nothing.

477
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:29.665
Oh, goodness.

478
00:46:29.748 --> 00:46:31.750
-Take care, Anna.
-Thank you, sir.

479
00:46:32.668 --> 00:46:33.794
Are you laughing?

480
00:46:34.002 --> 00:46:35.504
Not yet... but...

481
00:46:43.679 --> 00:46:45.514
I brought blankets for Momma.

482
00:46:45.973 --> 00:46:47.766
You're drunk already?

483
00:46:47.975 --> 00:46:51.103
I'm still drunk from last
night, you woke me up.

484
00:46:51.186 --> 00:46:53.522
Don't let Momma see you this way.

485
00:46:53.605 --> 00:46:55.190
Don't fuss on me.

486
00:46:58.735 --> 00:47:01.530
Hello, Anna. You steady?

487
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:03.782
I am pickled.

488
00:47:04.616 --> 00:47:05.659
You got any whiskey?

489
00:47:05.742 --> 00:47:07.536
Well, you drank it last night.

490
00:47:07.619 --> 00:47:09.955
Only my man can drink my whiskey.

491
00:47:10.038 --> 00:47:11.582
I'm not your man.

492
00:47:11.665 --> 00:47:13.792
Well, maybe you don't have a choice.

493
00:47:15.043 --> 00:47:17.004
Are you making threats?

494
00:47:17.087 --> 00:47:18.088
Hey, hey.

495
00:47:18.172 --> 00:47:20.591
Keep yourself settled down in here, Anna.

496
00:47:22.009 --> 00:47:23.093
You'll do right.

497
00:47:23.969 --> 00:47:26.346
You're making threats, Anna.
Don't do that.

498
00:47:27.222 --> 00:47:30.976
I'm telling you a secret.
You think I open my legs for any man?

499
00:47:31.059 --> 00:47:32.519
Well, I get that feeling.

500
00:47:33.395 --> 00:47:34.813
Hey! Hey! Come on, now.

501
00:47:34.897 --> 00:47:36.023
Get her in the other room now.

502
00:47:36.148 --> 00:47:38.150
You are no different, Ernest. You hear me?

503
00:47:38.233 --> 00:47:40.110
-You are no different.
-Get in the other room!

504
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.113
Older sister, calm down.

505
00:47:43.197 --> 00:47:44.198
Yeah, I'm all right.

506
00:47:58.754 --> 00:48:00.255
You are so pretty.

507
00:48:03.425 --> 00:48:04.760
You know me?

508
00:48:05.802 --> 00:48:06.845
Yes.

509
00:48:07.554 --> 00:48:08.639
What do you know?

510
00:48:10.057 --> 00:48:12.351
Fuck yourself, Byron Burkhart.

511
00:48:12.434 --> 00:48:13.477
-Anna! Anna!
-Anna!

512
00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.728
Hey! Come on, now!

513
00:48:14.811 --> 00:48:17.898
I will cut you, talking to my man!
I'll kill that woman, then I'll kill you!

514
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:20.442
-Stand down.
-I'm not your man. I'll do as I please.

515
00:48:20.526 --> 00:48:22.444
-Get her out of here!
-Get her out!

516
00:48:22.528 --> 00:48:23.529
Give me that.

517
00:48:23.612 --> 00:48:24.988
-She's got a gun.
-Give me that. Come on!

518
00:48:25.072 --> 00:48:27.908
Stay away from these white women!
Stay away from those wahk' oh nohn-hohn!

519
00:48:27.991 --> 00:48:28.992
Move!

520
00:48:29.952 --> 00:48:31.078
Get out!

521
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:35.999
Savage!

522
00:48:45.259 --> 00:48:47.344
Come on, Charlie. Right up here.

523
00:48:59.147 --> 00:49:02.150
This one French soldier, he came up,
he tried to grab that saucer pan.

524
00:49:02.234 --> 00:49:05.279
I saw his leg blown clean off.

525
00:49:05.362 --> 00:49:09.157
A lot of them came back like this.
Shaking.

526
00:49:11.201 --> 00:49:12.286
Hey.

527
00:49:13.745 --> 00:49:17.207
Did you hear
they found Charlie Whitehorn dead?

528
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:20.544
Aye. Aye. Who did that?

529
00:49:21.795 --> 00:49:22.921
I don't know.

530
00:49:24.798 --> 00:49:26.216
Was it his wife?

531
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.135
Most likely.

532
00:49:35.559 --> 00:49:36.643
Now, Anna...

533
00:49:42.566 --> 00:49:44.568
It's time for me to take her home now.

534
00:49:57.247 --> 00:49:58.957
You're...

535
00:49:59.875 --> 00:50:01.919
...wild.

536
00:50:06.924 --> 00:50:11.637
Anna. Anna, mahn-theen eh-txahn.
Byron's waiting. Come on.

537
00:50:12.721 --> 00:50:13.805
Come on, now.

538
00:50:18.268 --> 00:50:22.773
You're my best blessing.

539
00:50:24.733 --> 00:50:26.944
I'm your favorite?

540
00:50:28.195 --> 00:50:29.655
Yes...

541
00:50:31.031 --> 00:50:36.161
...stay with me here.

542
00:50:37.329 --> 00:50:39.581
-Anna, come on, now.
-Stop banging.

543
00:50:53.679 --> 00:50:55.597
Time for me to go, Ernest?

544
00:50:57.641 --> 00:50:58.642
Yeah.

545
00:50:59.852 --> 00:51:01.854
You don't want me here, do you?

546
00:51:02.813 --> 00:51:05.107
You trying to get rid of me,
aren't you, snake?

547
00:51:08.026 --> 00:51:10.153
You're afraid I'll say too much.

548
00:51:12.531 --> 00:51:14.658
Yeah, I see you're afraid.

549
00:51:20.706 --> 00:51:21.999
You look better.

550
00:51:22.082 --> 00:51:23.959
Why, thank you, Sister.

551
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:29.590
You're my wealth, you know that?

552
00:51:32.593 --> 00:51:34.219
Don't go out tonight.

553
00:51:34.303 --> 00:51:36.430
You worry too much, oh-theh-zhoo.

554
00:51:36.513 --> 00:51:38.390
Come on. Let's go.

555
00:51:38.473 --> 00:51:39.850
Okay.

556
00:51:39.933 --> 00:51:43.187
Goodness, let's go find another drink.

557
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:44.938
No, I'm taking you home, Anna.

558
00:51:45.022 --> 00:51:47.149
No, you're taking me to Whizbang.

559
00:51:49.568 --> 00:51:51.403
Byron's taking her home now.

560
00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:53.155
I'm too drunk.

561
00:51:53.238 --> 00:51:54.323
You don't say.

562
00:51:54.406 --> 00:51:55.699
He's taking her home.

563
00:52:13.175 --> 00:52:16.303
Mollie, it's your sister, Anna.

564
00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.764
Come on, now. Come on, now, sweetheart.

565
00:53:00.848 --> 00:53:01.932
Come on, now.

566
00:53:03.308 --> 00:53:04.476
Come on.

567
00:53:13.235 --> 00:53:15.988
Is this your sister, Anna Brown?

568
00:53:18.115 --> 00:53:22.786
Pardon me.
Is this your sister, Anna Brown?

569
00:53:24.371 --> 00:53:25.372
Yes.

570
00:53:36.175 --> 00:53:41.597
Two members of our tribe,
Anna Brown and Charles Whitehorn,

571
00:53:42.598 --> 00:53:43.974
were both murdered.

572
00:53:44.057 --> 00:53:47.019
These ahn-shdah-heh are murdering us.

573
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:49.813
In the case of Anna Brown,

574
00:53:49.897 --> 00:53:52.357
her family here on the west side
have raised funds

575
00:53:52.441 --> 00:53:55.527
of the amount of about $2,000 to $5,000

576
00:53:55.611 --> 00:53:59.031
for the arrest and conviction
of the murderer.

577
00:54:01.366 --> 00:54:03.994
Mollie Burkhart has hired
a private investigator.

578
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:09.958
When this money started coming,

579
00:54:10.042 --> 00:54:12.294
we should've known
it came with something else.

580
00:54:12.377 --> 00:54:14.713
'Cause it's the white man's money.

581
00:54:14.796 --> 00:54:20.260
It's not what we were taught, coming
out of Missouri, Arkansas and Kansas.

582
00:54:20.344 --> 00:54:24.348
What has come to our reservation
that doesn't belong here?

583
00:54:24.431 --> 00:54:28.977
And it's them.
They're like buzzards circling our people.

584
00:54:29.645 --> 00:54:30.646
Yeah.

585
00:54:30.729 --> 00:54:33.899
They wanna pick us body clean,
leave nothing.

586
00:54:34.942 --> 00:54:38.654
When we left Missouri,
we didn't even leave our dead babies.

587
00:54:39.238 --> 00:54:42.324
We laid 'em down
and we rode our warriors over 'em

588
00:54:42.407 --> 00:54:46.620
to tell everyone
that we'll never leave this place again.

589
00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:49.831
Or we'll die here, to the last one.

590
00:54:49.915 --> 00:54:51.375
Yeah.

591
00:55:07.683 --> 00:55:08.684
Switch.

592
00:55:19.695 --> 00:55:23.240
Hey, Mollie.
Mollie, words can't express my grief,

593
00:55:23.824 --> 00:55:26.201
but she's with the Lord now.

594
00:55:26.285 --> 00:55:27.703
She's with the Lord.

595
00:55:33.125 --> 00:55:36.295
And they even come here now
to marry our young women.

596
00:55:37.921 --> 00:55:39.673
I employ some of them.

597
00:55:39.756 --> 00:55:43.302
They say they are my friends,
but I don't think they really are.

598
00:55:43.385 --> 00:55:45.304
Some of them don't even pretend to work.

599
00:55:45.387 --> 00:55:47.472
They walk around,
they act like they own the place.

600
00:55:47.556 --> 00:55:49.808
-Okay, gentlemen. Hold still, please.
-We got it!

601
00:55:49.892 --> 00:55:54.021
I mean, these people are bums,
nee-shdah-heh, common vags.

602
00:55:55.147 --> 00:55:58.692
We can't turn to the county to help us.

603
00:55:59.902 --> 00:56:03.447
We can't go to the state of Oklahoma
to help us.

604
00:56:04.489 --> 00:56:06.825
Why have we ever even thought they would?

605
00:56:07.826 --> 00:56:11.747
We were here before them.
This is our homeland we came to.

606
00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:13.332
Yeah. Yeah.

607
00:56:13.415 --> 00:56:17.211
Why we put our children here
is because Mother Earth allowed us here.

608
00:56:17.294 --> 00:56:18.295
Yeah.

609
00:56:18.378 --> 00:56:22.883
No one takes us off this earth
until God calls us all home.

610
00:56:22.966 --> 00:56:24.092
Yeah.

611
00:56:24.176 --> 00:56:25.427
And we've got to realize that,

612
00:56:25.511 --> 00:56:28.222
but we've also got to realize
this evil that's come here.

613
00:56:28.305 --> 00:56:30.265
You have something it wants.

614
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:31.350
Yeah.

615
00:56:31.433 --> 00:56:35.020
It didn't want you when we was coming
through genocides, our coming home.

616
00:56:35.646 --> 00:56:39.733
But now we put the original 25 families
together in this room.

617
00:56:39.816 --> 00:56:40.817
Yeah.

618
00:56:40.901 --> 00:56:42.361
And we're here to go with you.

619
00:56:42.444 --> 00:56:47.533
The old saying says
is that Osage is dying by the enemy.

620
00:56:47.616 --> 00:56:51.286
Do not let them die alone.
You go join them.

621
00:56:52.079 --> 00:56:54.998
So we can go to heaven
knowing we're still warriors.

622
00:56:55.874 --> 00:57:01.505
We have to change, but before we do,
we need to be like a fire on this earth

623
00:57:01.588 --> 00:57:04.591
and get rid of all that stops
or gets in front of us.

624
00:57:05.384 --> 00:57:07.928
My council, I ask you for your support.

625
00:57:08.679 --> 00:57:13.809
All of you men. And our women,
these mothers, these ee-nahn here.

626
00:57:13.892 --> 00:57:17.145
All of our elders have come through
this landscape,

627
00:57:17.229 --> 00:57:21.108
and we-- only thing we know
is that we have each other.

628
00:57:21.942 --> 00:57:24.319
We have a Lord that's been good to us.

629
00:57:25.279 --> 00:57:28.866
And this other--
We never prayed for the great life.

630
00:57:28.949 --> 00:57:30.784
We just prayed for life.

631
00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:33.579
And that's what
I'm gonna be praying for now,

632
00:57:33.662 --> 00:57:36.748
is that we get that life
for these kids coming.

633
00:57:36.832 --> 00:57:38.917
And, see, our days are over.

634
00:57:39.835 --> 00:57:44.381
We're just barely living out a sundown,
but their days are starting.

635
00:57:45.215 --> 00:57:49.052
And I want 'em to be Osages,
just like the gift that Grandma gave me,

636
00:57:49.136 --> 00:57:51.680
just like the gift that Grandma gave you.

637
00:57:51.763 --> 00:57:53.473
Yeah.

638
00:57:53.557 --> 00:57:54.558
Thank you, Chief.

639
00:57:54.641 --> 00:57:59.021
I would like to add a thousand dollars
to that reward money

640
00:58:00.731 --> 00:58:04.151
for any information about these murders.

641
00:58:04.943 --> 00:58:09.198
That means if anyone knows anything
about it, you must come to me.

642
00:58:10.532 --> 00:58:13.535
You all know where I am. I'm easy to find.

643
00:58:14.328 --> 00:58:17.998
Thank you, Mr. Hale. Your friendship
has always been greatly appreciated.

644
00:58:18.081 --> 00:58:22.377
I'll do anything, anything,
to help the Osage in their plight,

645
00:58:22.461 --> 00:58:24.296
in their vale of tears.

646
00:58:24.379 --> 00:58:28.342
I move that we send Mr. Barney McBride
to Washington, D.C.

647
00:58:28.425 --> 00:58:29.510
I will second that.

648
00:58:29.593 --> 00:58:31.970
Mr. McBride, Mrs. McBride.

649
00:58:32.054 --> 00:58:33.347
Yes, Chief. I'm here.

650
00:58:33.847 --> 00:58:37.309
Resolution 23. Mr. McBride will travel
to Washington, D.C.

651
00:58:37.392 --> 00:58:39.353
to meet with
the Indian Affairs Commission,

652
00:58:39.436 --> 00:58:43.315
where he will ask for private
investigators and additional police

653
00:58:43.398 --> 00:58:45.984
so that they can look into this matter
of all this death.

654
00:58:46.068 --> 00:58:47.194
Do you accept this?

655
00:58:47.277 --> 00:58:48.403
Yes, I do.

656
00:58:58.497 --> 00:59:00.499
Bill. Reta.

657
00:59:01.333 --> 00:59:02.626
How are you, Ernest?

658
00:59:03.502 --> 00:59:06.380
So you're here now, huh?

659
00:59:07.756 --> 00:59:10.175
Reta was a comfort to me when Minnie died.

660
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:33.866
Hey, listen. Leave the jewels be
on this one, all right?

661
00:59:33.949 --> 00:59:36.285
I do it so nobody notices.

662
00:59:36.368 --> 00:59:40.789
No, no. Come on, Frank. Just leave it be,
just this one time, for me.

663
00:59:40.873 --> 00:59:44.126
-It's my wife's sister, all right?
-There.

664
00:59:44.918 --> 00:59:46.879
$25 for a hearse rental?

665
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:52.759
$1,650 for a mahogany casket?

666
00:59:54.052 --> 00:59:56.889
You charging me Osage prices.
You think I'm thick, huh?

667
00:59:56.972 --> 00:59:59.016
No, everybody pays the same.

668
00:59:59.099 --> 01:00:02.769
Come on, now. McAllister's entire funeral
wasn't more than 300.

669
01:00:02.853 --> 01:00:04.188
This here's 2,000, Frank.

670
01:00:04.271 --> 01:00:06.773
McAllister's daughter
was just a youngster.

671
01:00:06.857 --> 01:00:09.651
I'll tell you what.
I'ma talk to King Hale about this.

672
01:00:09.735 --> 01:00:10.777
See what he has to say.

673
01:00:10.861 --> 01:00:13.989
Well, if you want her in a wooden box,
I'll put her in one.

674
01:00:14.072 --> 01:00:17.826
I don't want no wooden box, all right?
You are charging me Osage prices.

675
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:20.871
Your wife even said
she wanted an open casket.

676
01:00:21.663 --> 01:00:23.498
But there's no face.

677
01:00:23.582 --> 01:00:26.752
There's no face, Frank.
Why would she want it open, huh?

678
01:00:27.794 --> 01:00:29.922
You trying to steal our money?
Is that what you're trying--

679
01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:31.006
It ain't--

680
01:00:31.798 --> 01:00:33.592
It ain't your money.

681
01:00:33.675 --> 01:00:37.429
It's easy for you to get me more money
and pay my bill.

682
01:00:37.513 --> 01:00:40.057
I work for my money.

683
01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:44.728
Just like the good Lord says,
you sow and reap, Ernest.

684
01:00:44.811 --> 01:00:48.273
When was the last time you've seen
one of them Osages working, huh?

685
01:00:49.316 --> 01:00:55.322
Well, your sister, Anna, leaves an estate
of approximately $100,000

686
01:00:55.405 --> 01:01:01.370
to be willed to your mother, Lizzie Q.,
and you, Mollie, and you, Reta.

687
01:01:02.496 --> 01:01:06.375
You know, I was thinking,
that is a substantial amount of money.

688
01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:09.628
I heard that Tall Chief hired
the Emmett Miller minstrel show

689
01:01:09.711 --> 01:01:11.797
to come in and play
for his birthday party,

690
01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:17.302
and I thought, "Why couldn't we do
something like that with this money?"

691
01:01:17.386 --> 01:01:20.764
Maybe have a party for the town,
and maybe invite another band out.

692
01:01:20.848 --> 01:01:23.559
It does not do to talk to this man.

693
01:01:25.561 --> 01:01:27.688
Evil surrounds my heart.

694
01:01:28.438 --> 01:01:34.236
Many times, I cry, and this evil
around my heart comes out of my eyes.

695
01:01:38.615 --> 01:01:41.451
I close my heart
and keep what is good there,

696
01:01:42.619 --> 01:01:44.162
but hate comes.

697
01:01:46.039 --> 01:01:49.668
And they say I ought to kill
these white men who killed my family.

698
01:01:52.921 --> 01:01:56.967
Mrs. Burkhart. Bill Burns. I solve crimes.

699
01:01:57.676 --> 01:02:01.805
This is my card.
My address is New York, London, Paris,

700
01:02:01.889 --> 01:02:04.933
Montreal, Chicago, Los Angeles,
Cairo, Berlin, Boston

701
01:02:05.017 --> 01:02:06.852
and wherever else a law-abiding citizen...

702
01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:09.313
-Mr. Barney McBride?
-Yes.

703
01:02:09.396 --> 01:02:11.440
Telegram for you, sir. Just arrived.

704
01:02:39.176 --> 01:02:42.304
...hasn't been to Anna's place
to corroborate Byron's story.

705
01:02:42.387 --> 01:02:46.141
Now, I stopped by there,
and I did find her alligator purse,

706
01:02:46.225 --> 01:02:49.269
which could suggest that
Byron is not lying. He brought her home.

707
01:02:50.812 --> 01:02:53.398
Well, my brother's not a liar.

708
01:02:55.150 --> 01:03:00.072
Your youngest sister, Minnie, who died
of the wasting illness two years ago,

709
01:03:00.155 --> 01:03:02.366
she was married to a "Bill Smith."

710
01:03:02.449 --> 01:03:03.450
Yes.

711
01:03:04.326 --> 01:03:08.622
And that is the same Bill Smith
currently married to your sister, Reta.

712
01:03:09.248 --> 01:03:10.249
Yes.

713
01:03:11.124 --> 01:03:12.626
Same Bill Smith.

714
01:03:14.169 --> 01:03:15.587
Two sisters.

715
01:03:16.421 --> 01:03:22.135
Mr. Smith, he is a busy fellow,
talking around town,

716
01:03:22.219 --> 01:03:24.888
conducting his own investigation
into Anna's death.

717
01:03:24.972 --> 01:03:27.975
-Much obliged, Sheriff. Thank you, sir.
-Thank y'all again. Appreciate it.

718
01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:29.560
Were you aware of that?

719
01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.980
You were?

720
01:03:33.897 --> 01:03:35.023
Yes.

721
01:03:37.317 --> 01:03:38.986
Now, you went straight to Mollie's house?

722
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:40.404
We didn't go straight there.

723
01:03:40.487 --> 01:03:41.947
Where'd you go?

724
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:44.074
Graveyard out past Florer's.

725
01:03:44.157 --> 01:03:47.494
She wanted to look at her land,
then she wanted to visit her father.

726
01:03:48.954 --> 01:03:51.915
I cannot see my daddy
with my hair flying everywhere.

727
01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:55.252
Did you know
I was gonna have a little baby?

728
01:03:55.335 --> 01:03:58.046
-Oh, my goodness, no.
-Oh, it's true.

729
01:03:59.423 --> 01:04:01.008
I'm gonna name her Minnie too.

730
01:04:07.806 --> 01:04:09.183
Give Minnie my love.

731
01:04:12.227 --> 01:04:14.062
Did you know that Anna was pregnant?

732
01:04:19.443 --> 01:04:20.485
Anna?

733
01:04:21.987 --> 01:04:22.988
Yes.

734
01:04:28.493 --> 01:04:30.454
Anna was pregnant.

735
01:04:31.246 --> 01:04:32.456
She was pregnant.

736
01:04:33.373 --> 01:04:34.374
Did he say Byron?

737
01:04:36.168 --> 01:04:37.211
No.

738
01:04:39.087 --> 01:04:40.088
Me?

739
01:04:42.174 --> 01:04:44.259
No. No.

740
01:04:45.135 --> 01:04:47.930
Well, you make sure
we steer clear of that.

741
01:04:49.473 --> 01:04:54.061
Mr. Smith says that he has
a pretty good idea who killed your sister.

742
01:04:55.145 --> 01:04:59.858
He says that he will tell all
when he has the true facts.

743
01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:04.780
So what-- What's he found out?

744
01:05:05.364 --> 01:05:07.282
I just don't know that part yet.

745
01:05:08.033 --> 01:05:09.409
What's he found out?

746
01:05:10.536 --> 01:05:11.537
Nothing.

747
01:05:13.288 --> 01:05:14.831
I'll go see Blackie.

748
01:05:19.545 --> 01:05:21.380
On that, what we talked about...

749
01:05:22.047 --> 01:05:23.090
About it, yeah.

750
01:05:23.173 --> 01:05:24.758
To see what he may say on that.

751
01:05:25.342 --> 01:05:26.343
That's right.

752
01:05:32.808 --> 01:05:37.896
Yeah. Yeah!
Boy, we gonna be rich tonight, boy!

753
01:05:40.649 --> 01:05:42.484
-Ernest.
-Where's Blackie?

754
01:05:45.946 --> 01:05:47.948
-That's it, huh?
-Yeah.

755
01:05:49.116 --> 01:05:52.035
Osage graves.
That's disgusting work, right there.

756
01:05:52.119 --> 01:05:54.037
It's dirty. It's real dirty.

757
01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.790
You want something to pay big, Blackie?

758
01:05:57.958 --> 01:05:59.877
You can't be working
with them trouble boys.

759
01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.337
You gotta use your head.
You gotta think, Blackie.

760
01:06:03.338 --> 01:06:06.258
Hale, he's been talking
about us partnering up.

761
01:06:08.177 --> 01:06:12.264
You know Bill Smith?
He's been going around town talking a lot.

762
01:06:12.347 --> 01:06:19.188
Now, if someone were to knock off
Bill Smith and Reta too, right?

763
01:06:19.271 --> 01:06:24.234
If she was gone, all that estate money
would go to my mother-in-law, Lizzie Q.,

764
01:06:24.318 --> 01:06:26.111
and she wills it to my children.

765
01:06:27.279 --> 01:06:30.157
Now, that's a good deal, that.
It's a real good deal.

766
01:06:30.741 --> 01:06:31.950
For you, it is.

767
01:06:32.492 --> 01:06:33.702
For all.

768
01:06:33.785 --> 01:06:35.454
Smith and her,
they're gone a lot from home.

769
01:06:35.537 --> 01:06:38.165
All you gotta do is go down there,
and you plant the stand in the house.

770
01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:40.667
And when they come in, you get 'em.

771
01:06:40.751 --> 01:06:44.463
They got-- Reta's got three
or four diamonds. She got some ear screws.

772
01:06:44.546 --> 01:06:46.757
Bill Smith, he always carries
two or three hundred in his pocket.

773
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.175
You could have that.

774
01:06:48.258 --> 01:06:52.429
You could have that, and I know Hale
would pay you a thousand for the job.

775
01:06:54.681 --> 01:06:56.558
That sound like a good one to you,
Blackie?

776
01:07:01.271 --> 01:07:03.941
You know my little Buick roadster?

777
01:07:04.024 --> 01:07:06.026
You know, the red one
you always got your eye on.

778
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:07.236
Yeah?

779
01:07:07.945 --> 01:07:12.407
How about I throw in my Buick roadster?
It's insured more than it's worth.

780
01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:15.410
Now, I'd get the insurance money,
and you'd get the Buick.

781
01:07:17.371 --> 01:07:19.790
That's just a little side deal
between me and you.

782
01:07:19.873 --> 01:07:22.084
Hale doesn't need to know about that one.

783
01:07:22.167 --> 01:07:23.710
But that's real generous.

784
01:07:24.336 --> 01:07:26.547
Goddamn, you're a greedy Jew, Ernest.

785
01:07:28.882 --> 01:07:30.467
Well, I just love money.

786
01:07:31.301 --> 01:07:35.180
It's true. It's true. I damn near love it
as much as I love my wife.

787
01:07:39.893 --> 01:07:41.270
Ernest?

788
01:07:41.353 --> 01:07:42.563
Yeah.

789
01:07:43.605 --> 01:07:44.606
Come here.

790
01:07:50.279 --> 01:07:51.363
What is it, huh?

791
01:07:53.782 --> 01:07:55.784
Feeling better than this morning, huh?

792
01:07:55.868 --> 01:07:56.994
A little.

793
01:07:57.077 --> 01:08:01.373
Yeah. You just need sleep, I tell you.

794
01:08:02.958 --> 01:08:04.960
Sleep. That's the first thing now.

795
01:08:06.253 --> 01:08:08.505
I don't sleep anymore.

796
01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:14.344
I know. I know. Just try.
You try to get some rest, all right?

797
01:08:15.012 --> 01:08:16.054
Come on, now.

798
01:08:20.184 --> 01:08:23.103
I don't even know if you love me anymore.

799
01:08:23.729 --> 01:08:27.191
Mollie, of course I love you.

800
01:08:28.901 --> 01:08:30.694
I need you here.

801
01:08:31.653 --> 01:08:36.950
I'm right here, Mollie. I am right here.

802
01:08:40.454 --> 01:08:41.622
I love you.

803
01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.822
You gonna try to wake the kids up now.

804
01:09:19.535 --> 01:09:21.453
You gonna wake the kids up.

805
01:09:22.996 --> 01:09:24.957
Yeah. Yeah.

806
01:09:29.086 --> 01:09:32.923
They're calling it "insulin."
It's from Toronto and costs dearly.

807
01:09:34.258 --> 01:09:37.094
There ain't more than five people
that can afford it.

808
01:09:37.177 --> 01:09:41.473
It ain't officially for sale yet,
but Bill Hale has seen to it for you.

809
01:09:42.307 --> 01:09:43.976
Did you hear that, sweetheart?

810
01:09:45.519 --> 01:09:47.354
-This one.
-This one.

811
01:09:47.938 --> 01:09:49.606
It's from a cow's pancreas.

812
01:09:51.692 --> 01:09:54.027
It'll come down to us once a week.

813
01:09:55.195 --> 01:09:56.405
Look at that.

814
01:09:57.322 --> 01:10:01.326
Wow. A cow's pancreas.

815
01:10:02.411 --> 01:10:04.371
Diabetes can be an awful misery.

816
01:10:06.582 --> 01:10:09.042
-Have you eaten in the last hour?
-No.

817
01:10:09.126 --> 01:10:10.752
Lift your blouse, please.

818
01:10:11.336 --> 01:10:12.421
There you go.

819
01:10:12.504 --> 01:10:14.089
Have you had anything to drink?

820
01:10:14.923 --> 01:10:18.093
Goat's milk. Hotcakes.

821
01:10:21.805 --> 01:10:25.976
Well, she's had taffy and bacon too.
Go on. Tell 'em.

822
01:10:26.685 --> 01:10:27.895
You gotta tell 'em.

823
01:10:27.978 --> 01:10:30.564
If you don't stop eating sweets,
this won't matter.

824
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:34.359
You will lose your feet, or worse,
if you eat like a white.

825
01:10:34.943 --> 01:10:36.153
Hear that?

826
01:10:39.364 --> 01:10:40.365
It's all right.

827
01:10:42.367 --> 01:10:43.619
Goddamn it.

828
01:10:44.995 --> 01:10:47.331
-Hey, Blackie, stop!
-Blackie!

829
01:10:47.414 --> 01:10:48.540
-Oh, shit.
-Stop!

830
01:10:48.624 --> 01:10:51.460
-Goddamn it, Blackie! Stop running!
-Where are you gonna go to?

831
01:10:51.543 --> 01:10:52.794
You gotta catch me first!

832
01:10:54.046 --> 01:10:55.088
Look at that.

833
01:11:04.848 --> 01:11:05.974
Hey there.

834
01:11:08.644 --> 01:11:10.437
You brought the Buick out, huh?

835
01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:13.774
Get in. Get in.

836
01:11:35.796 --> 01:11:36.839
Byron.

837
01:11:37.464 --> 01:11:39.216
Brother, come here.

838
01:11:43.095 --> 01:11:44.638
-Here?
-Yeah, right there.

839
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:49.768
Kneel, please, Ernest.

840
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:52.271
Kneel.

841
01:12:02.197 --> 01:12:04.366
Did you make a deal with Blackie Thompson

842
01:12:04.449 --> 01:12:07.911
to steal your red roadster
and cash the insurance?

843
01:12:13.959 --> 01:12:14.960
I...

844
01:12:17.004 --> 01:12:18.213
Yes, I did.

845
01:12:18.297 --> 01:12:22.676
Well, Blackie's been arrested
for stealing your car.

846
01:12:23.343 --> 01:12:25.012
What were you supposed to do?

847
01:12:26.889 --> 01:12:31.226
I was supposed to feel him out
on Bill and Reta.

848
01:12:31.935 --> 01:12:34.563
So who takes care
of Bill Smith and his blanket now?

849
01:12:35.898 --> 01:12:36.899
I--

850
01:12:38.567 --> 01:12:39.902
I don't know, sir.

851
01:12:42.613 --> 01:12:43.822
Remove the book.

852
01:12:44.489 --> 01:12:45.490
I...

853
01:12:51.121 --> 01:12:52.581
I'm sorry.

854
01:12:52.664 --> 01:12:54.166
All right, Brother. Stand up.

855
01:12:55.876 --> 01:12:56.919
Stand up.

856
01:13:00.881 --> 01:13:02.132
Elbows on the table.

857
01:13:17.147 --> 01:13:21.068
I'm a 32nd degree Mason.

858
01:13:21.151 --> 01:13:23.028
I am imbued

859
01:13:24.655 --> 01:13:29.076
with confidence, trust and responsibility,
among other things.

860
01:13:30.077 --> 01:13:31.119
Yes, sir.

861
01:13:31.662 --> 01:13:32.913
You know what that is?

862
01:13:34.456 --> 01:13:35.916
No, sir.

863
01:13:37.084 --> 01:13:38.460
Shit!

864
01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:48.011
Damn.

865
01:13:50.931 --> 01:13:52.766
Now get up! Sit over there.

866
01:14:04.987 --> 01:14:07.739
Are you challenged to lead your house?

867
01:14:10.492 --> 01:14:11.660
No.

868
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:15.205
She's hired a private investigator

869
01:14:16.248 --> 01:14:18.959
who noses and brings unwanted eyes.

870
01:14:21.211 --> 01:14:25.299
She got the tribal council to pay
for Barney McBride's trip to Washington.

871
01:14:27.467 --> 01:14:30.012
-I know.
-She's a very hard-headed woman

872
01:14:30.095 --> 01:14:32.264
and she's gonna make it harder on you!

873
01:14:32.347 --> 01:14:36.143
I'm sorry, King.
You know she's just stubborn.

874
01:14:37.269 --> 01:14:40.147
Ernest, handsome son,

875
01:14:41.607 --> 01:14:44.902
what do you think's gonna happen
to Mollie and all of them?

876
01:14:45.861 --> 01:14:48.655
I love 'em,
but in the turning of the earth,

877
01:14:49.448 --> 01:14:50.574
they're gonna go.

878
01:14:51.575 --> 01:14:53.160
Their time is over.

879
01:14:53.994 --> 01:14:55.621
That's it. Gone.

880
01:14:56.205 --> 01:15:00.250
Ernest, there will be no lightning strike
and it stops happening.

881
01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:02.002
It will happen.

882
01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:06.006
These headrights must go to Mollie,

883
01:15:06.089 --> 01:15:10.385
not to the mother,
not to the sister, Reta, not Bill Smith.

884
01:15:11.261 --> 01:15:12.554
Yes, sir.

885
01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:15.474
You've got to take back control
of your home.

886
01:15:19.561 --> 01:15:20.646
Now, you hear me?

887
01:15:23.649 --> 01:15:24.691
Yes, King.

888
01:16:24.293 --> 01:16:27.296
World champeen roper Henry Grammer,

889
01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.716
finest and biggest moonshine dealer
in the county.

890
01:16:31.466 --> 01:16:32.509
Look at all that blue.

891
01:16:33.677 --> 01:16:34.803
Is that gold, Henry?

892
01:16:34.887 --> 01:16:37.264
Better than gold. It's recognition.

893
01:16:38.223 --> 01:16:41.768
Now, Henry, what I need
is someone who can do a job,

894
01:16:41.852 --> 01:16:45.439
someone who can take a proposition
to do an old man and his blanket.

895
01:16:45.522 --> 01:16:48.859
And I just don't want any man.
I need someone who can do it right.

896
01:16:48.942 --> 01:16:51.361
'Cause I need them both to go
at the same time.

897
01:16:51.945 --> 01:16:54.781
So it can't be poison whiskey
or something like that.

898
01:16:54.865 --> 01:16:56.033
It's gotta be foolproof.

899
01:16:59.703 --> 01:17:01.371
-Hey, John?
-Yeah.

900
01:17:02.039 --> 01:17:04.374
Take this on up the house,
stash it for me.

901
01:17:04.917 --> 01:17:06.293
Don't let Maggie see it.

902
01:17:06.376 --> 01:17:08.837
Oh, now, she got eyes, Henry.

903
01:17:08.921 --> 01:17:11.089
She caught me last time,
and I don't want that woman--

904
01:17:11.173 --> 01:17:12.174
Give it to me.

905
01:17:13.383 --> 01:17:15.844
Why don't y'all just go talk
to Blackie Thompson?

906
01:17:15.928 --> 01:17:17.971
-Well...
-Blackie?

907
01:17:18.972 --> 01:17:21.975
Well, he's in a penitentiary right now.

908
01:17:22.059 --> 01:17:23.352
Tell him why.

909
01:17:26.063 --> 01:17:28.232
Well, I messed up and...

910
01:17:28.774 --> 01:17:29.816
Go on. You tell him.

911
01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:34.488
'Cause he had a harebrained idea to get
him nabbed on insurance money on his car.

912
01:17:35.072 --> 01:17:36.114
That's bad luck.

913
01:17:36.198 --> 01:17:37.449
I'll say.

914
01:17:39.284 --> 01:17:40.702
There's Dick Gregg.

915
01:17:41.286 --> 01:17:44.873
No. Dick's wanted in Arkansas.

916
01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:47.876
Hell, he's wanted in Kansas.

917
01:17:48.502 --> 01:17:50.712
Son of a bitch is so hid,
he can't even find himself.

918
01:17:54.591 --> 01:17:56.051
You need a yegg man...

919
01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:59.680
somebody, if youse want explosives,

920
01:17:59.763 --> 01:18:03.517
who'd make damn sure you get in there
and get them both, same time.

921
01:18:04.476 --> 01:18:06.478
Soup under the house.

922
01:18:07.771 --> 01:18:09.731
Nitro or dynamite.

923
01:18:10.649 --> 01:18:12.234
Blow 'em up.

924
01:18:15.237 --> 01:18:17.239
I think that'd be Acie Kirby.

925
01:18:17.823 --> 01:18:19.992
-Acie?
-Oh, yeah.

926
01:18:20.075 --> 01:18:21.952
-Where's he at?
-I don't really know.

927
01:18:22.035 --> 01:18:23.161
He's pretty squirrelly.

928
01:18:23.245 --> 01:18:24.997
The son of a bitch right there
might though.

929
01:18:25.914 --> 01:18:27.916
-Hey, John?
-Yeah.

930
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.169
Where's Acie Kirby hiding out these days?

931
01:18:30.878 --> 01:18:35.424
I don't rightly know. Hiding out
in his old hole somewhere, I suspect.

932
01:18:35.507 --> 01:18:37.384
Why don't you take your skinny ass
up to the barn,

933
01:18:37.467 --> 01:18:39.761
see if you can find a shovel
and go dig him up?

934
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:41.471
Now?

935
01:18:42.389 --> 01:18:45.017
All right.
I'll ask around, see if I can find him.

936
01:18:50.355 --> 01:18:51.690
Acie Kirby.

937
01:19:01.575 --> 01:19:03.994
Acie. That's your man.

938
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:26.391
Ready?

939
01:19:28.477 --> 01:19:29.561
Come on.

940
01:19:31.647 --> 01:19:33.649
-Afternoon, ma'am.
-Mrs. Burkhart.

941
01:19:33.732 --> 01:19:35.526
Set up right here. All right.

942
01:19:50.624 --> 01:19:51.625
What?

943
01:20:13.647 --> 01:20:18.735
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you
to just step outside for me a minute

944
01:20:18.819 --> 01:20:20.821
while I speak to my wife.

945
01:20:21.488 --> 01:20:22.948
-Outside?
-Of course, Ernest.

946
01:20:23.031 --> 01:20:24.032
Just for a minute.

947
01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:32.332
Well...

948
01:20:32.916 --> 01:20:33.959
What now? What now?

949
01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:42.718
We need the shots and the insulin.

950
01:20:42.801 --> 01:20:44.344
What then, Mollie? What?

951
01:20:53.353 --> 01:20:54.438
All right.

952
01:20:55.898 --> 01:20:57.566
All right, all right.

953
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:06.450
So, fellas, just give me that.
I'm gonna go ahead and do it.

954
01:21:06.533 --> 01:21:08.285
You're administering the shot?

955
01:21:08.368 --> 01:21:09.369
Yeah. Yeah.

956
01:21:09.453 --> 01:21:12.080
Ernest, Bill Hale has entrusted us
with this care.

957
01:21:12.164 --> 01:21:15.209
I know, I know. It's just the way
it's going right now, all right?

958
01:21:15.292 --> 01:21:17.294
We're still gonna have to charge you
for this visit.

959
01:21:17.377 --> 01:21:19.880
We made the trip out here. Gas, time...

960
01:21:19.963 --> 01:21:22.799
Fuck a duck. You're gonna charge me
for this robbery? Is that it?

961
01:21:23.383 --> 01:21:25.052
It's only right.

962
01:21:25.135 --> 01:21:26.595
Give me that.

963
01:21:26.678 --> 01:21:30.474
I'll get it back to you.
Go on now. Get outta here. Go on.

964
01:21:32.643 --> 01:21:34.019
Goddamn it.

965
01:21:38.524 --> 01:21:39.525
There you go.

966
01:21:40.859 --> 01:21:44.196
Made me send the doctors away.
The doctors.

967
01:21:44.947 --> 01:21:46.865
What, am I a doctor? Are you a doctor?

968
01:21:47.533 --> 01:21:49.952
Stupid, stubborn bitch ought
to let them men do their work.

969
01:21:50.035 --> 01:21:51.411
That's what you should do--

970
01:21:52.204 --> 01:21:53.539
So I'm the doctor now?

971
01:21:53.622 --> 01:21:55.415
I'm the doctor and the nurse

972
01:21:55.499 --> 01:21:58.460
and the housekeeper, babysitter,
God knows what else all, right?

973
01:21:58.544 --> 01:21:59.795
It's not helping.

974
01:22:01.463 --> 01:22:02.548
It's not any good.

975
01:22:03.423 --> 01:22:07.594
King Hale has gifted this to you.
He has gifted this. You--

976
01:22:07.678 --> 01:22:11.223
Five people in the whole world are getting
this, and you're one of them, Mollie.

977
01:22:11.890 --> 01:22:14.476
You're one of the lucky ones.
Think of the children.

978
01:22:15.102 --> 01:22:17.396
That's gonna save your life right there.

979
01:22:18.355 --> 01:22:20.440
But no, no,
you think you know everything, right?

980
01:22:20.524 --> 01:22:22.734
With your Indian ways.

981
01:22:22.818 --> 01:22:25.445
You think you're gonna get better
with all them medicine men

982
01:22:25.529 --> 01:22:30.492
and all them roots and all them herbs
and all the... All that horseshit?

983
01:22:30.576 --> 01:22:31.994
You ain't, Mollie!

984
01:22:32.828 --> 01:22:34.746
That's real medicine!

985
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:47.593
You think someone's gonna hurt you?

986
01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:50.888
You think I'm gonna hurt you?

987
01:22:53.891 --> 01:22:55.434
You don't say nothing to that?

988
01:23:30.052 --> 01:23:32.596
Give it a chance now, all right?

989
01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.644
Maybe it's gotta get worse
before it gets better, Mollie.

990
01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:45.150
I am to take care of you.

991
01:23:45.234 --> 01:23:49.321
No one is gonna hurt you
when I'm in front.

992
01:24:10.259 --> 01:24:11.343
Open.

993
01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:15.097
How are you feeling, Henry?

994
01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:18.183
Good. Well, sometimes I feel sad.

995
01:24:18.267 --> 01:24:19.810
That's not a health issue for us.

996
01:24:19.893 --> 01:24:24.189
He's fit as a fiddle.
Come on, Henry, he's healthy as a horse.

997
01:24:24.273 --> 01:24:25.315
That he is, Bill.

998
01:24:25.399 --> 01:24:28.151
So what are you gonna do?
You gonna kill this Indian?

999
01:24:28.235 --> 01:24:29.361
How'd you know?

1000
01:24:31.572 --> 01:24:32.656
Better watch out.

1001
01:24:34.408 --> 01:24:36.702
Well, no, he just needs to be insured,
that's all.

1002
01:24:36.785 --> 01:24:38.579
It's just a formality, but he needs it.

1003
01:24:38.662 --> 01:24:40.414
Well, what about my melancholy?

1004
01:24:40.497 --> 01:24:42.416
A little whiskey can help that.

1005
01:24:44.668 --> 01:24:45.669
You better watch out.

1006
01:24:47.421 --> 01:24:49.840
I don't know, Bill.
It may not look very good.

1007
01:24:50.674 --> 01:24:52.509
It's hard to justify this one.

1008
01:24:53.802 --> 01:24:55.429
He owes me a lot of money.

1009
01:24:57.514 --> 01:24:59.850
Bill, my guardian won't give me
what's mine.

1010
01:24:59.933 --> 01:25:01.018
What do you need?

1011
01:25:01.101 --> 01:25:02.603
I wanna buy some moonshine.

1012
01:25:02.686 --> 01:25:04.897
No, no, Henry. You don't need that stuff.
It's hurting you.

1013
01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:06.190
Doctor said I should use it.

1014
01:25:06.273 --> 01:25:09.401
I don't care what he says. He don't know
what the hell he's talking about.

1015
01:25:09.484 --> 01:25:10.903
-Come on, Henry.
-Hi, Pearl.

1016
01:25:10.986 --> 01:25:13.405
-My wife's on Roy Bunch.
-What?

1017
01:25:13.488 --> 01:25:15.282
My wife's on Roy Bunch.

1018
01:25:15.365 --> 01:25:16.575
Who cares about Roy Bunch?

1019
01:25:16.658 --> 01:25:19.411
You got women all over you, my friend.
You're lucky with that.

1020
01:25:19.494 --> 01:25:23.749
And be at peace with what you have.
And don't do anything stupid.

1021
01:25:23.832 --> 01:25:25.209
I wanna hurt myself.

1022
01:25:25.292 --> 01:25:27.169
That's not a man's way out.

1023
01:25:27.252 --> 01:25:29.087
A man's to get what's his.
They won't give that to me.

1024
01:25:29.171 --> 01:25:31.590
A wife's to give respect.
I don't wanna be here anymore.

1025
01:25:31.673 --> 01:25:34.801
I'm ashamed.
I'm ashamed to be an Osage Indian.

1026
01:25:34.885 --> 01:25:37.429
Just give me some moonshine
or get me a gun.

1027
01:25:37.513 --> 01:25:40.349
Now, Henry,
you have a good time with Pearl.

1028
01:25:40.432 --> 01:25:42.267
Don't you do anything stupid, you hear?

1029
01:25:42.351 --> 01:25:45.020
I need you, my friend. I need you.

1030
01:25:51.693 --> 01:25:54.154
Henry, no. What you doing here, Henry?
Henry, no.

1031
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:58.909
-What do you think you're doing?
-Henry, stop it!

1032
01:25:58.992 --> 01:26:00.994
-Think you can touch my wife?
-Get him off me!

1033
01:26:01.078 --> 01:26:02.204
You stay off my wife!

1034
01:26:02.287 --> 01:26:05.415
You stay off my wife!
You stay off my wife!

1035
01:26:05.499 --> 01:26:07.125
-I've done nothing to you.
-You're the--

1036
01:26:07.209 --> 01:26:10.587
I'm tired of asking friends for things
when I can pay my own way.

1037
01:26:10.671 --> 01:26:12.631
-Henry, you've got to bring your guardian.
-Henry.

1038
01:26:12.714 --> 01:26:14.883
Who tells you how to spend your own money?

1039
01:26:14.967 --> 01:26:15.968
Just stop, Henry.

1040
01:26:16.051 --> 01:26:18.846
My ancestors had a free life
before you got off your stinky boats.

1041
01:26:20.931 --> 01:26:23.016
You think you're better than me, huh?

1042
01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:24.685
-Think you're better than me?
-Come on.

1043
01:26:24.768 --> 01:26:28.355
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You went and hit Roy Bunch. Come on.

1044
01:26:28.438 --> 01:26:31.525
I knocked him down, Reverend Hale.
I knocked him down.

1045
01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.492
Why do you take care of him?

1046
01:26:40.576 --> 01:26:42.077
'Cause he's a melancholic.

1047
01:26:43.245 --> 01:26:45.414
You know he tried to do away with himself
last year?

1048
01:26:46.206 --> 01:26:47.207
Oh, yeah?

1049
01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:51.003
I take care of that man because
he's my neighbor and he's my best friend.

1050
01:26:52.254 --> 01:26:54.840
That's $25,000 laying there.

1051
01:26:56.133 --> 01:26:59.970
I got an insurance policy on him.
It's against what he owes me.

1052
01:27:00.596 --> 01:27:04.516
So, if he succeeds in demising himself
before the end of the year, I forfeit.

1053
01:27:05.934 --> 01:27:08.645
So, he needs to stay alive
at least a few more months.

1054
01:27:11.064 --> 01:27:13.400
I might even get a chance
at his headrights.

1055
01:27:15.861 --> 01:27:17.613
Something you should know...

1056
01:27:20.532 --> 01:27:23.702
Mollie's first husband
is that man right there on the floor.

1057
01:27:27.039 --> 01:27:28.999
What do you mean, "first husband"?

1058
01:27:29.082 --> 01:27:30.876
Osage, they don't divorce.

1059
01:27:30.959 --> 01:27:36.965
And they were. They were married
in a ceremony on the reservation.

1060
01:27:37.049 --> 01:27:40.636
What do you mean?
You mean, she's still married to him?

1061
01:27:40.719 --> 01:27:44.223
No, no. They were 15. It's traditional.
Doesn't mean anything--

1062
01:27:44.306 --> 01:27:47.976
If I was married, I'd be telling her that.
She didn't tell me that.

1063
01:27:49.561 --> 01:27:50.812
How's she treatin' you?

1064
01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:56.068
She treats me just fine.
She's a good one, you know.

1065
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:59.530
Well, you let her have her secrets.

1066
01:28:00.405 --> 01:28:02.241
That way, you have yours.

1067
01:30:52.411 --> 01:30:54.121
Is there anyone?

1068
01:30:55.038 --> 01:30:58.375
Pitts Beaty's trying to get his Klan
to find the killers who killed Anna.

1069
01:31:00.335 --> 01:31:05.883
He said they're helping
to take the lazy men away from town.

1070
01:31:05.966 --> 01:31:10.387
Well, Pitts and his Klan are trying to
have authority here, and they have none.

1071
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:12.890
They need to let the police do their job.

1072
01:31:13.473 --> 01:31:16.518
I'm very disapproving
of the Ku Klux Klan, Mollie.

1073
01:31:16.602 --> 01:31:18.395
They're very hungry for a power.

1074
01:31:19.688 --> 01:31:20.939
And they ain't gonna get it.

1075
01:31:23.859 --> 01:31:25.277
Is there anyone?

1076
01:31:26.945 --> 01:31:28.947
The tribe tried Barney McBride.

1077
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:33.994
He didn't come back.

1078
01:31:38.207 --> 01:31:41.126
We hired a private investigator, but...

1079
01:31:48.967 --> 01:31:50.052
You paid him?

1080
01:31:51.637 --> 01:31:54.223
-Yes.
-Well, he ran off, didn't he?

1081
01:31:54.848 --> 01:31:57.643
Ernest, he ran off. Ernest, he ran off.

1082
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:59.770
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

1083
01:31:59.853 --> 01:32:02.648
Seems that way, King. Seems that way.
Seems that way.

1084
01:32:03.565 --> 01:32:05.901
I think we should be
a little more considerate

1085
01:32:05.984 --> 01:32:09.196
about how we spend Mollie's money, Ernest.

1086
01:32:09.279 --> 01:32:12.074
I don't mean that as a criticism,
I'm just saying.

1087
01:32:12.157 --> 01:32:14.159
-You bought a farm.
-Yeah.

1088
01:32:14.243 --> 01:32:15.619
Okay. You didn't consult me.

1089
01:32:15.702 --> 01:32:19.206
Maybe you should've consulted me
because I'm there for you, Ernest.

1090
01:32:19.289 --> 01:32:20.666
I'm there for both of you.

1091
01:32:21.583 --> 01:32:25.504
You met Mollie because of me.
You're here because of me.

1092
01:32:25.587 --> 01:32:30.592
Let me help you. Let me give you
my advice, my consultation.

1093
01:32:30.676 --> 01:32:34.680
Judson, he didn't tell me
about a hog sickness that was going on,

1094
01:32:34.763 --> 01:32:38.767
but now-- I learned my lesson, King.
Won't happen again.

1095
01:32:39.726 --> 01:32:43.230
Just a bad investment, that's all.
Bad investment.

1096
01:32:46.692 --> 01:32:47.693
Mollie?

1097
01:32:50.028 --> 01:32:52.739
There's something different
about you tonight. What is it?

1098
01:32:58.370 --> 01:33:01.206
Well, now's a good a time as any, so...

1099
01:33:06.170 --> 01:33:08.213
-Mollie, she's pregnant.
-What?

1100
01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:12.509
-Yeah.
-Oh, my goodness! Oh, my...

1101
01:33:12.593 --> 01:33:14.261
Yeah? That so?

1102
01:33:14.344 --> 01:33:15.345
Yeah.

1103
01:33:17.723 --> 01:33:19.808
Oh, my goodness.

1104
01:33:19.892 --> 01:33:24.521
Yeah, we got the news
that Mollie's having a baby, King.

1105
01:33:25.814 --> 01:33:28.775
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

1106
01:33:28.859 --> 01:33:31.153
Blessings. Blessings upon this house.

1107
01:33:31.695 --> 01:33:33.655
-Wonderful. Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1108
01:33:33.739 --> 01:33:34.740
Bless you.

1109
01:33:34.823 --> 01:33:36.491
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

1110
01:33:36.575 --> 01:33:38.118
-Congratulations.
-Congrats.

1111
01:33:38.202 --> 01:33:40.245
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

1112
01:33:41.622 --> 01:33:43.582
We are just thrilled.

1113
01:33:43.665 --> 01:33:44.917
Thank you, Willie.

1114
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.463
Henry! Henry. Come on in here.
We just got some wonderful news.

1115
01:33:49.546 --> 01:33:51.840
Mollie is pregnant again.

1116
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:57.179
I have a feeling it's a girl.
I am never wrong about these things.

1117
01:33:57.262 --> 01:33:58.555
Congratulations.

1118
01:33:58.639 --> 01:34:00.140
I can feel it in my bones.

1119
01:34:00.724 --> 01:34:02.476
-We're gonna have to start a baby quilt.
-Yes.

1120
01:34:02.559 --> 01:34:04.019
We'll pick out colors. We'll go to...

1121
01:34:04.102 --> 01:34:05.312
Congratulations.

1122
01:34:06.605 --> 01:34:08.273
We'll go to the dry goods store...

1123
01:34:08.357 --> 01:34:09.733
Sorry to bother you.

1124
01:34:09.816 --> 01:34:12.152
Uncle, I just need
to have some words with you, please.

1125
01:34:12.236 --> 01:34:14.863
Of course, Henry. You just go sit
over there. I'll be right there.

1126
01:34:14.947 --> 01:34:16.240
I just gotta talk to them.

1127
01:34:16.323 --> 01:34:18.283
-You go. Wait for me there.
-Thank you.

1128
01:34:26.458 --> 01:34:29.378
You been loving with her in this sickness?

1129
01:34:31.171 --> 01:34:37.678
She's my wife, King.
That's what happens. Yeah.

1130
01:34:40.722 --> 01:34:43.141
Maybe it's just a "preversion" of yours.

1131
01:34:46.979 --> 01:34:49.731
Yeah. God bless you and the child.

1132
01:35:00.868 --> 01:35:02.286
First husband, huh?

1133
01:35:04.621 --> 01:35:07.249
You think that means
he's got a claim on the family?

1134
01:35:21.013 --> 01:35:22.014
Henry.

1135
01:35:22.723 --> 01:35:23.807
Uncle.

1136
01:35:24.516 --> 01:35:27.895
Ramsey,
I know you're in bad way in this life.

1137
01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:31.356
Lots of kids. Seven or eight, I heard.

1138
01:35:31.982 --> 01:35:33.901
Yeah, I got a passel of 'em, don't I?

1139
01:35:35.736 --> 01:35:38.572
King Bill Hale wants to know
if you'd like a job

1140
01:35:39.281 --> 01:35:40.949
getting someone done.

1141
01:35:41.033 --> 01:35:44.786
I can't do that.
I didn't sign on for that kind of work.

1142
01:35:46.079 --> 01:35:47.414
Well, it's an Indian.

1143
01:35:48.916 --> 01:35:50.209
Now, that's different.

1144
01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:52.669
You know Henry Roan?

1145
01:35:52.753 --> 01:35:54.171
Nah, I don't know him.

1146
01:35:56.256 --> 01:35:58.258
Well, what you think?

1147
01:36:01.512 --> 01:36:04.389
Lookee here. I'm gonna take you right now.

1148
01:36:04.473 --> 01:36:08.227
I'm gonna buy you a roadster so you can
drive around and do this for him.

1149
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:11.522
It's gonna take a lot more than a roadster
to get me out of the bind I'm in.

1150
01:36:11.605 --> 01:36:13.482
Well, we'll work something out.

1151
01:36:13.565 --> 01:36:15.776
I hope you don't rumble
over this killing neither.

1152
01:36:15.901 --> 01:36:18.403
The Indian, he's a melancholic.

1153
01:36:18.487 --> 01:36:20.280
He's tried to do away with himself
twice't already.

1154
01:36:20.364 --> 01:36:21.865
That's what Hale's been saying.

1155
01:36:22.616 --> 01:36:25.744
He even wants you to make it
like Roan did it to himself.

1156
01:36:26.578 --> 01:36:31.083
In the front of the head, you understand?
Front of the head.

1157
01:36:57.985 --> 01:36:59.987
Knights come marching in.
That's it, Pitts.

1158
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:01.488
Hey, Ernest.

1159
01:37:08.829 --> 01:37:12.165
So Ernest had me meet this Indian
over at a restaurant in Fairfax.

1160
01:37:12.249 --> 01:37:14.501
-John. John Ramsey.
-John Ramsey.

1161
01:37:14.585 --> 01:37:16.003
-Henry. It's a pleasure.
-How you doing?

1162
01:37:16.086 --> 01:37:19.631
He sat down beside me,
and I smelled whiskey on his breath.

1163
01:37:19.715 --> 01:37:21.800
...you might be in the market
for a little hooch?

1164
01:37:21.884 --> 01:37:23.385
I told him I could sell him some.

1165
01:37:23.468 --> 01:37:25.554
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I'm the man to see for that.

1166
01:37:25.637 --> 01:37:29.183
I told him to meet me out on the road
running through Sol Smith's pasture

1167
01:37:29.266 --> 01:37:30.851
about ten o'clock.

1168
01:37:31.643 --> 01:37:35.063
Partner. Look what I done found
in the possum hole.

1169
01:37:46.867 --> 01:37:48.535
Come on. Don't be stingy, now.

1170
01:37:50.913 --> 01:37:52.122
Yeah.

1171
01:37:58.212 --> 01:38:00.547
Boy, that'll make your liver
turn inside out.

1172
01:38:02.549 --> 01:38:09.181
A few times after I met this Indian, well,
we kind of got to liking one another,

1173
01:38:09.264 --> 01:38:12.184
what with his troubles
being respected and all.

1174
01:38:12.267 --> 01:38:14.603
And then sometimes
we'd go to Mrs. Mackie's place.

1175
01:38:14.686 --> 01:38:16.480
So he took it. Can you imagine that?

1176
01:38:16.563 --> 01:38:19.733
What kind of sheriff goes around
selling cocaine? You tell me that.

1177
01:38:19.816 --> 01:38:21.193
Don't you tell me that.

1178
01:38:21.777 --> 01:38:23.445
This went on for a while.

1179
01:38:24.363 --> 01:38:26.740
I was trying to rib up
a little more courage,

1180
01:38:27.574 --> 01:38:31.286
and one day I decided to pull the job,
everything being favorable.

1181
01:38:32.371 --> 01:38:36.250
So I told this Indian we get us a jug
and some girls

1182
01:38:37.042 --> 01:38:40.003
and meet me out on the road
running through Smith's pasture.

1183
01:38:40.087 --> 01:38:42.631
Trust me, this is better
than the last stuff we had.

1184
01:39:19.418 --> 01:39:21.003
Goddamn.

1185
01:39:22.129 --> 01:39:24.882
-You got a minute?
-Yeah, yeah. Watch Cowboy for me.

1186
01:39:31.471 --> 01:39:32.639
What? What is it?

1187
01:39:32.723 --> 01:39:33.724
Where's Hale?

1188
01:39:33.807 --> 01:39:37.060
I don't know. Whizbang, Pawhuska. What?

1189
01:39:37.728 --> 01:39:38.937
Tell him it's done.

1190
01:39:39.771 --> 01:39:41.982
You did it? You did it where?

1191
01:39:42.065 --> 01:39:45.485
Out on the road running through
Sol Smith's pasture. And that's it.

1192
01:39:45.569 --> 01:39:47.821
Take this. I don't want it no more.

1193
01:39:47.905 --> 01:39:49.573
-John.
-I'm done with this outfit.

1194
01:39:59.666 --> 01:40:01.084
Henry Roan's dead.

1195
01:40:10.219 --> 01:40:11.637
Did he kill himself?

1196
01:40:13.138 --> 01:40:14.348
Don't know.

1197
01:40:19.102 --> 01:40:21.104
He was always sad.

1198
01:40:22.981 --> 01:40:24.066
Always.

1199
01:40:27.152 --> 01:40:28.612
You knew him well, right?

1200
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:31.657
Since we were children.

1201
01:40:37.037 --> 01:40:40.082
Does your uncle know? They were friends.

1202
01:40:40.832 --> 01:40:44.086
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He knows.

1203
01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:48.882
Was he murdered?

1204
01:40:52.761 --> 01:40:53.804
Don't know.

1205
01:40:56.181 --> 01:41:00.602
He tried to kill himself last year.

1206
01:41:02.938 --> 01:41:04.356
Did you know that?

1207
01:41:11.738 --> 01:41:16.034
Was he murdered or did he kill himself?
Do you know?

1208
01:41:19.162 --> 01:41:20.330
I don't know.

1209
01:41:23.166 --> 01:41:28.380
You know, Roy Bunch, he was making
a lot of noise about killing him.

1210
01:41:28.463 --> 01:41:30.048
You know, he's on his wife,

1211
01:41:31.258 --> 01:41:33.177
so don't need to look too far, right?

1212
01:41:35.429 --> 01:41:39.516
Maybe he just killed himself,
you know, like you said.

1213
01:41:44.021 --> 01:41:46.315
It was supposed to be a suicide,
you dumbbell.

1214
01:41:46.398 --> 01:41:47.941
You didn't tell him to leave the gun?

1215
01:41:48.025 --> 01:41:49.735
I told him to leave the gun.
I told him exac--

1216
01:41:49.818 --> 01:41:52.237
-You told him to leave the gun?
-Just like you told me, King.

1217
01:41:52.321 --> 01:41:54.072
I don't know why he didn't.
I don't know why.

1218
01:41:54.156 --> 01:41:55.824
I told him just like you told me.

1219
01:41:56.617 --> 01:41:58.368
You told him to do it
in the front of the head?

1220
01:41:58.452 --> 01:41:59.786
Then why'd he do it in the back?

1221
01:41:59.870 --> 01:42:02.915
It's so simple. The front is the front,
the back is the back!

1222
01:42:02.998 --> 01:42:05.417
He has to make it look
like he done it himself!

1223
01:42:05.501 --> 01:42:08.962
It just looks like murder. It's not
supposed to be that way, you hear?

1224
01:42:09.046 --> 01:42:12.549
I told him the front of the head.
Just like this. Just like you told me.

1225
01:42:12.633 --> 01:42:14.676
I promise you. I promise you.
I swear on my children.

1226
01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:18.055
-Don't do that. Calm down. Settle down.
-I swear on my children, King.

1227
01:42:18.138 --> 01:42:21.141
And don't swear on your children.
Makes you look foolish.

1228
01:42:21.225 --> 01:42:23.644
I ain't. I ain't foolish
'cause I've done it right.

1229
01:42:29.399 --> 01:42:30.776
What is this, King?

1230
01:42:31.777 --> 01:42:32.986
'Fraid lights.

1231
01:42:33.904 --> 01:42:36.406
They're putting up lights
to keep the murder away.

1232
01:42:46.291 --> 01:42:47.292
Go, go, go.

1233
01:43:00.013 --> 01:43:02.724
There he is. Pull up the car.

1234
01:43:03.517 --> 01:43:05.269
Hey, Roy! Roy!

1235
01:43:10.858 --> 01:43:13.819
This is not the place
you should be at right now.

1236
01:43:13.902 --> 01:43:16.572
And I have a line
that says you should leave town,

1237
01:43:16.655 --> 01:43:20.033
'cause the sheriff's office is looking
to charge you in this killing.

1238
01:43:20.117 --> 01:43:22.452
They know you was on shooting terms
with Henry.

1239
01:43:23.871 --> 01:43:27.791
If I run, I'm guilty.
I ain't got nothing to be guilty about.

1240
01:43:27.875 --> 01:43:28.959
If you run--

1241
01:43:29.835 --> 01:43:33.589
You don't run, you're gonna go to prison
for this, you done it or not.

1242
01:43:33.672 --> 01:43:37.843
Just my friendly word. I would run.

1243
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:41.597
Thank you, Bill. I don't think I will.

1244
01:43:43.765 --> 01:43:45.309
And you're not my friend.

1245
01:43:46.393 --> 01:43:48.562
Take my chances right here in Fairfax.

1246
01:44:03.118 --> 01:44:08.457
You are of the Elder Sky People.

1247
01:44:09.666 --> 01:44:11.168
Little Anna...

1248
01:44:11.251 --> 01:44:15.088
...your name is Wah hre lum pa.

1249
01:44:26.725 --> 01:44:29.102
What is this wasting illness, Mollie?

1250
01:44:30.646 --> 01:44:34.399
Wasting? Wasting away?

1251
01:44:36.610 --> 01:44:38.111
Minnie died from it.

1252
01:44:39.655 --> 01:44:41.448
Momma died from it too.

1253
01:44:42.783 --> 01:44:44.284
Anna was shot.

1254
01:44:51.542 --> 01:44:54.127
This blanket is a target on our backs.

1255
01:45:26.743 --> 01:45:29.621
Why don't we just leave?
Go to Colorado Springs.

1256
01:45:30.330 --> 01:45:34.418
Look at me. I can't make that trip.

1257
01:45:35.627 --> 01:45:37.963
How are you being taken care of, Mollie?

1258
01:45:38.797 --> 01:45:40.757
I have Ernest and my children.

1259
01:45:42.217 --> 01:45:46.054
Ernest takes care of me. The best he can.

1260
01:45:46.138 --> 01:45:47.764
-Nettie?
-Yes.

1261
01:45:47.848 --> 01:45:49.808
Can you get my sister some toast, please?

1262
01:45:49.892 --> 01:45:52.436
-Of course. And a bit more coffee too?
-Thank you.

1263
01:45:53.478 --> 01:45:55.272
Little sister.

1264
01:46:00.402 --> 01:46:01.403
Thank you.

1265
01:46:14.374 --> 01:46:17.085
So you and Mollie
staying in town now too, huh?

1266
01:46:17.169 --> 01:46:18.504
Yeah, we're here now, so...

1267
01:46:27.971 --> 01:46:31.350
You made a nice place for yourself, Bill.
Real nice.

1268
01:46:31.433 --> 01:46:35.020
Thank you, Ernest.
Shoun brothers gave us a sweet deal

1269
01:46:35.103 --> 01:46:37.606
and they left some nice things here
for us too.

1270
01:46:37.689 --> 01:46:39.316
Is that right?

1271
01:46:39.399 --> 01:46:43.487
Well, not nearly as nice as what
you've been buying but good enough for us.

1272
01:46:44.363 --> 01:46:49.326
Well, you know Mollie.
She likes her nice things, so...

1273
01:46:51.912 --> 01:46:53.413
Not as much as you do.

1274
01:46:55.874 --> 01:47:00.337
Almost sounded to me
like you was calling me a squaw man, Bill.

1275
01:47:00.963 --> 01:47:04.341
Now, Ernest, that's something
I'd never call another man.

1276
01:47:04.424 --> 01:47:05.509
Right, right.

1277
01:47:06.969 --> 01:47:08.136
No offense taken.

1278
01:47:13.016 --> 01:47:14.184
You need a drink?

1279
01:47:15.978 --> 01:47:19.022
Yeah. I'll take a drink if you got one.

1280
01:47:20.524 --> 01:47:21.525
No.

1281
01:47:24.194 --> 01:47:25.696
Then why di'ya ask?

1282
01:47:26.488 --> 01:47:28.323
Well, you seem nervous, that's all.

1283
01:47:30.158 --> 01:47:34.705
See, the thing is, Bill,
I ain't got no nerves. None at all.

1284
01:47:38.542 --> 01:47:40.794
It's just that I don't like
talking to you.

1285
01:47:41.837 --> 01:47:43.172
That's mostly it.

1286
01:47:45.215 --> 01:47:47.509
Well, have I done something
to bother you, Ernest?

1287
01:47:47.593 --> 01:47:50.345
Something that's bothering me?
No, no. Just--

1288
01:47:50.929 --> 01:47:54.808
Just the way you are that bothers me.
That's what it is.

1289
01:47:56.185 --> 01:48:00.397
Well, Lord made me, Ernest.
Ain't nothing I can do about that.

1290
01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:02.024
No. There ain't.

1291
01:48:03.442 --> 01:48:04.776
Unless you aim to kill me.

1292
01:48:05.694 --> 01:48:07.446
Or is that your big brother's job?

1293
01:48:17.581 --> 01:48:20.792
Mollie? It's time to go, sweetheart.

1294
01:48:21.835 --> 01:48:23.003
-Jim?
-Myrtle?

1295
01:48:23.086 --> 01:48:26.673
If you have anything special in the house,
get it out as soon as possible.

1296
01:48:27.799 --> 01:48:28.842
Okay.

1297
01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:32.471
David?

1298
01:48:45.025 --> 01:48:46.610
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1299
01:48:46.693 --> 01:48:48.695
I'm off to Fort Worth for the Stock Show,

1300
01:48:48.779 --> 01:48:52.074
but I want you to find Acie Kirby
and tell him it's time on the Smith job.

1301
01:48:56.078 --> 01:48:57.079
You hear me?

1302
01:48:57.663 --> 01:49:02.501
I just don't know him.
I don't know Acie Kirby. Wh--

1303
01:49:02.584 --> 01:49:04.211
Where does he find Acie?

1304
01:49:04.294 --> 01:49:06.505
Just find John Ramsey. He'll know.

1305
01:49:06.588 --> 01:49:10.509
You got that? Find John Ramsey.
Tell Ramsey to tell Acie it's time.

1306
01:49:10.592 --> 01:49:11.885
We're off to Fort Worth.

1307
01:49:14.763 --> 01:49:16.473
We're off to Fort Worth.

1308
01:49:18.934 --> 01:49:21.395
Look at me like this makes sense.

1309
01:49:21.979 --> 01:49:27.234
I am. I understand.
I'll find Ramsey and I'll tell him.

1310
01:49:27.317 --> 01:49:28.735
Okay.

1311
01:49:36.201 --> 01:49:38.161
-John?
-Yeah, that's me.

1312
01:49:38.245 --> 01:49:40.581
I got a message for you from King Hale.

1313
01:49:40.664 --> 01:49:42.207
He wants you to find Acie Kirby

1314
01:49:42.291 --> 01:49:44.626
and tell him to take care
of Bill and Reta, all right?

1315
01:49:44.710 --> 01:49:47.921
-It's time now, John.
-I can't do it right now. My wife's sick.

1316
01:49:48.005 --> 01:49:50.716
Well, my wife's sick too.
My wife's sick too.

1317
01:49:50.799 --> 01:49:51.800
Why don't you do it?

1318
01:49:51.884 --> 01:49:54.970
Why are you always trying to get
somebody like me to do your work for you?

1319
01:49:55.053 --> 01:49:58.098
Well, 'cause I don't know--
I don't know Acie Kirby.

1320
01:49:59.016 --> 01:50:01.351
I don't know
what he looks like even, right?

1321
01:50:01.435 --> 01:50:04.605
I would do it, but I can't do it 'cause
I don't know what he looks like, John.

1322
01:50:04.688 --> 01:50:05.856
-All right.
-I'm sorry.

1323
01:50:05.939 --> 01:50:08.901
All right.
I'll do it, but I can't do it right now.

1324
01:50:08.984 --> 01:50:10.777
You can't get to it right now,
so you know,

1325
01:50:10.861 --> 01:50:13.488
this needs to be done straightaway,
not to wait on it, for Hale.

1326
01:50:13.572 --> 01:50:15.699
It has to be done straightaway. Right now.

1327
01:50:15.782 --> 01:50:17.951
You know, you're being mighty pushy,
Ernest.

1328
01:50:18.035 --> 01:50:19.786
-I gotta get back to work.
-Let me tell you something.

1329
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:23.624
You got one more chance, John.
This is it. One more chance.

1330
01:50:23.707 --> 01:50:26.418
I'ma talk to King Hale. I'ma tell him
you're gonna do it right now.

1331
01:50:26.502 --> 01:50:30.672
-I don't wanna lose this job.
-John, you ain't got no choice! It's time.

1332
01:50:32.549 --> 01:50:33.884
Tryin' to be nice to you now.

1333
01:50:33.967 --> 01:50:36.720
-I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fix it.
-I'm tryin' to be nice to you, John!

1334
01:50:36.803 --> 01:50:39.473
-I'm doing it. I said I'm gonna do it.
-Yeah, you best do it.

1335
01:50:39.556 --> 01:50:40.891
Right now, John. Right now.

1336
01:50:51.401 --> 01:50:54.196
Acie. Acie.

1337
01:50:54.863 --> 01:50:56.156
Yeah.

1338
01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.408
It's John. Don't shoot.

1339
01:51:07.376 --> 01:51:08.794
You got your soup with you?

1340
01:51:13.131 --> 01:51:17.052
Momma! Mommy!

1341
01:51:17.636 --> 01:51:19.221
Where were you, huh?

1342
01:51:19.304 --> 01:51:20.597
I was at Reta's.

1343
01:51:20.681 --> 01:51:22.516
Well, you're supposed to be home.

1344
01:51:23.517 --> 01:51:24.518
Come on.

1345
01:51:28.188 --> 01:51:31.191
-Cowboy had an earache.
-Oh, boy. Really?

1346
01:51:31.275 --> 01:51:34.695
And you know Bill ain't too kind to Reta
when I'm not there.

1347
01:51:36.738 --> 01:51:38.115
Listen, Mollie, I-- I--

1348
01:51:39.575 --> 01:51:42.536
I don't want you going out so much
right now, with all that's going on.

1349
01:51:45.122 --> 01:51:47.165
But I was just at my sister's.

1350
01:51:47.416 --> 01:51:49.918
You and the kids stay
in the house.

1351
01:51:50.627 --> 01:51:51.670
All right?

1352
01:52:16.862 --> 01:52:20.032
-Oh, Lord!
-What was that? What was that?

1353
01:52:20.616 --> 01:52:22.409
I don't know! I don't know.

1354
01:52:22.492 --> 01:52:24.077
-Vera!
-Oh, Lord.

1355
01:52:24.703 --> 01:52:25.829
Vera!

1356
01:52:27.331 --> 01:52:28.582
Lizzie!

1357
01:52:29.166 --> 01:52:30.167
What happened?

1358
01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:31.752
Cowboy to Mommy.

1359
01:52:35.714 --> 01:52:39.051
This is just like Tulsa.
It's just like Tulsa.

1360
01:52:39.134 --> 01:52:42.346
-Careful, there's glass everywhere!
-Where the hell did that come from?

1361
01:52:42.429 --> 01:52:43.722
Whose house is it?

1362
01:52:46.099 --> 01:52:47.643
Whose house is it?

1363
01:52:48.810 --> 01:52:51.480
-It's Bill and Reta's!
-Bill and Reta's house.

1364
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:11.458
-Nettie stays in the back room, that way!
-Nettie's back there!

1365
01:53:11.542 --> 01:53:14.253
-Nettie Berkshire! She lives here!
-Nettie!

1366
01:53:14.336 --> 01:53:15.754
Nettie!

1367
01:53:15.838 --> 01:53:17.297
-Nettie!
-That's Bill Smith!

1368
01:53:17.381 --> 01:53:21.385
Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me, goddamn it!

1369
01:53:22.928 --> 01:53:23.971
Shoot me!

1370
01:53:25.764 --> 01:53:28.475
It's Reta! Reta's over here!

1371
01:53:29.768 --> 01:53:31.311
It's Reta, come on! It's Reta!

1372
01:53:36.441 --> 01:53:39.653
-Can you hear me, Reta?
-Reta. Reta. Reta.

1373
01:53:41.363 --> 01:53:42.447
Reta.

1374
01:53:53.792 --> 01:53:55.419
I think she's dead.

1375
01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:10.017
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

1376
01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:14.146
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

1377
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:16.982
Mommy! Mommy!

1378
01:54:35.125 --> 01:54:38.587
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

1379
01:54:39.755 --> 01:54:40.881
Ernest?

1380
01:55:08.492 --> 01:55:11.912
Welcome to the Fort Worth
Stock Show and Rodeo.

1381
01:55:11.995 --> 01:55:16.625
We invite you to head on over to ring 1
and meet rodeo champion Henry Grammer.

1382
01:55:16.708 --> 01:55:18.085
Get your autographs, be seen,

1383
01:55:18.168 --> 01:55:21.004
and talk with the man
up over there in ring 1.

1384
01:55:34.935 --> 01:55:36.144
Too much dynamite.

1385
01:55:50.117 --> 01:55:54.288
You know, you're pronouncing yourself
too much, Bill.

1386
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:04.381
Nettie, the maid.

1387
01:56:05.215 --> 01:56:07.843
They're still finding pieces of her.

1388
01:56:11.388 --> 01:56:17.436
Mollie Burkhart, incompetent.
Allotment number 285.

1389
01:56:17.519 --> 01:56:20.022
Three, two, one.

1390
01:56:21.356 --> 01:56:25.861
You want $300 to go to Washington, D.C.?

1391
01:56:25.944 --> 01:56:27.070
Yes.

1392
01:56:27.154 --> 01:56:30.741
Well, that's a hard trip
for an ailing woman, Mollie.

1393
01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:35.204
And I can't let you have this money
or make this trip.

1394
01:56:35.287 --> 01:56:38.498
That would do a disservice
to you and your children.

1395
01:56:39.208 --> 01:56:43.462
I want to go now because I
will not be alive much longer.

1396
01:56:45.422 --> 01:56:47.424
This may be the last thing I do.

1397
01:57:10.697 --> 01:57:12.407
It's nice to see you. Thank you, Chief.

1398
01:57:12.491 --> 01:57:14.117
-Thank you for your...
-Chief Bonnicastle.

1399
01:57:16.286 --> 01:57:19.289
President Coolidge, ladies and gentlemen,
please, look this way.

1400
01:57:19.373 --> 01:57:21.583
Three, two, one.

1401
01:57:23.043 --> 01:57:26.964
Mr. President, Mollie Burkhart.
Please send help.

1402
01:57:27.047 --> 01:57:30.050
There's murder in Osage,
and the police do nothing.

1403
01:57:31.176 --> 01:57:33.011
I lost my mother and my sisters.

1404
01:57:33.637 --> 01:57:36.473
So many Osage are killed
for the oil money. Please.

1405
01:57:37.266 --> 01:57:38.475
Yes.

1406
01:57:38.559 --> 01:57:39.560
Thank you.

1407
01:57:44.481 --> 01:57:45.524
Thank you so much.

1408
01:57:51.905 --> 01:57:53.991
Keep giving your wife her insulin...

1409
01:57:56.201 --> 01:57:59.246
and add this.

1410
01:58:02.416 --> 01:58:03.584
That's this whole vial.

1411
01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:07.379
Now, make sure
you get the balance right, Ernest.

1412
01:58:07.921 --> 01:58:09.506
Now, you keep the shots regular.

1413
01:58:11.091 --> 01:58:12.926
It's just to slow her down.

1414
01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:16.263
That's all it's gonna do. Slow her down.
That's all it'll do.

1415
01:58:16.972 --> 01:58:19.641
Same time every day,
30 minutes before a meal.

1416
01:58:20.225 --> 01:58:21.393
The whole vial.

1417
01:58:30.652 --> 01:58:33.739
Ernest, you believe in the Bible?

1418
01:58:37.326 --> 01:58:39.703
-Yeah.
-Miracles of old?

1419
01:58:42.206 --> 01:58:44.666
Expecting a miracle
to make all this go away?

1420
01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:49.963
You know they don't happen anymore.

1421
01:58:53.217 --> 01:58:54.218
I know.

1422
01:58:55.761 --> 01:58:59.890
I know, King.
She's gone to Washington, so...

1423
01:59:02.392 --> 01:59:06.396
Just gotta slow her down, right?

1424
01:59:07.064 --> 01:59:08.106
Yep.

1425
01:59:08.190 --> 01:59:10.025
Just gonna slow her down some.

1426
01:59:25.290 --> 01:59:27.251
I'm afraid, Sho-meen-kah.

1427
01:59:29.169 --> 01:59:30.587
What are you afraid of?

1428
01:59:34.508 --> 01:59:36.885
I'm afraid to eat in my house.

1429
01:59:38.846 --> 01:59:41.807
Why are you afraid
to eat in your own house?

1430
01:59:44.393 --> 01:59:45.811
I'm afraid.

1431
01:59:48.605 --> 01:59:52.150
Do you have any idea
who might want to harm you?

1432
02:00:04.496 --> 02:00:09.251
I wanna bring the upstairs bed down,
into the back room.

1433
02:00:11.879 --> 02:00:16.884
We will eat food only made by Vera,
no one else.

1434
02:00:23.807 --> 02:00:26.393
Baby Anna is sick with whooping cough.

1435
02:00:27.978 --> 02:00:29.229
She needs care.

1436
02:00:32.399 --> 02:00:34.776
I want her to live
with Brother and Sister Bigheart.

1437
02:00:38.572 --> 02:00:41.992
This will make her better.
It'll cure her cough.

1438
02:00:42.075 --> 02:00:44.077
Mommy!

1439
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:49.541
Ernest, you pick up my insulin
from the train, you alone.

1440
02:00:50.375 --> 02:00:53.003
Do not take it from the Shoun brothers.

1441
02:00:55.214 --> 02:00:56.340
Yes, Mollie.

1442
02:01:43.804 --> 02:01:48.809
My mother came to me.
She asked me to dance with her.

1443
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:54.481
I told her I can't dance anymore.

1444
02:02:02.239 --> 02:02:04.366
She told me I was dying.

1445
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:10.330
She didn't want me to die alone.

1446
02:02:14.418 --> 02:02:17.212
Well, dreams, they can
make you feel like dying...

1447
02:02:21.049 --> 02:02:25.637
for just a little while,
and then you come back.

1448
02:02:31.435 --> 02:02:33.353
She said the man is here.

1449
02:02:35.772 --> 02:02:36.857
What man?

1450
02:02:38.609 --> 02:02:40.110
The man in the hat.

1451
02:02:42.279 --> 02:02:44.239
I wanna talk to the man in the hat.

1452
02:02:46.158 --> 02:02:50.037
Well there's a lot of fellas with hats,
right?

1453
02:03:16.188 --> 02:03:17.731
You just rest.

1454
02:03:41.505 --> 02:03:42.631
Mr. Burkhart?

1455
02:03:43.799 --> 02:03:44.842
Who is that?

1456
02:03:45.551 --> 02:03:48.220
My name's Tom White.
I'm with the Bureau of Investigation.

1457
02:03:58.814 --> 02:03:59.815
How do you do?

1458
02:03:59.898 --> 02:04:03.026
Bureau... What? What is that?

1459
02:04:03.110 --> 02:04:07.447
I was sent down from Washington, D.C.,
to see about these murders.

1460
02:04:10.450 --> 02:04:12.911
To see what about 'em?

1461
02:04:14.621 --> 02:04:15.706
See who's doing it.

1462
02:04:19.376 --> 02:04:20.544
You a detective?

1463
02:04:21.753 --> 02:04:23.130
You a Pinkerton? What are you?

1464
02:04:23.213 --> 02:04:25.591
No, sir, I was a Texas Ranger.

1465
02:04:25.674 --> 02:04:29.720
I'm now with the federal government.
It's called the Bureau of Investigation.

1466
02:04:31.972 --> 02:04:34.057
I tell you what, if you got questions--

1467
02:04:34.141 --> 02:04:36.935
if you got questions,
y'all go talk to the sheriff.

1468
02:04:37.019 --> 02:04:38.854
He can probably tell you
what you need to know.

1469
02:04:38.937 --> 02:04:41.815
Yes, sir, I have. I talked to him.

1470
02:04:41.899 --> 02:04:47.779
But I'm here to speak with Mollie Burkhart
whose sisters and mother is dead.

1471
02:04:48.488 --> 02:04:53.035
Yeah, Mollie? Yeah, no, she's my wife.

1472
02:04:56.580 --> 02:05:01.793
She's sick, real sick right now.
I'm her husband Ernest Burkhart, so...

1473
02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:04.379
You can call on her another time.

1474
02:05:04.463 --> 02:05:06.215
But right now,
I don't know what to tell you.

1475
02:05:06.298 --> 02:05:08.217
She's not doing too well, so...

1476
02:05:10.219 --> 02:05:11.595
How's tomorrow?

1477
02:05:11.678 --> 02:05:14.598
Tomorrow? Well, it's-- That's too soon.

1478
02:05:14.681 --> 02:05:19.186
It's just, like I said,
she's not doing too well.

1479
02:05:19.269 --> 02:05:22.606
But you can come back--
Come back on Friday, how about that?

1480
02:05:23.982 --> 02:05:25.192
Well, is she home right now?

1481
02:05:28.862 --> 02:05:31.698
She got the diabetes, you understand?
Yeah.

1482
02:05:31.782 --> 02:05:34.243
-Does she?
-Yeah. Yeah.

1483
02:05:34.326 --> 02:05:37.162
She's resting right now,
and I'm caring for her, so...

1484
02:05:38.455 --> 02:05:41.333
Well, you come back on Friday, all right?

1485
02:05:42.668 --> 02:05:44.419
-Friday?
-Yeah. Friday.

1486
02:05:44.503 --> 02:05:46.588
I'll do that. Thank you, sir.

1487
02:06:09.528 --> 02:06:14.283
This is John Wren. Friend of Cousin Mary.
He's come looking for family.

1488
02:06:16.034 --> 02:06:17.828
-Welcome to Osage country.
-Thank you.

1489
02:06:20.163 --> 02:06:21.498
Welcome to Fairfax.

1490
02:06:22.207 --> 02:06:24.042
Welcome to Wahzhazhe land.

1491
02:06:24.126 --> 02:06:27.421
Yeah, thank you. I've been told
I have Osage relations in Hominy.

1492
02:06:28.338 --> 02:06:29.423
Where are you from?

1493
02:06:44.396 --> 02:06:47.107
I gotta talk to you, King.
Gotta talk to you. Sorry about that.

1494
02:06:47.191 --> 02:06:50.694
-Not now. You're gonna have to wait.
-No, I can't wait. I gotta talk to you--

1495
02:06:50.777 --> 02:06:53.530
Can't wait. They came to my house.
They came to my house.

1496
02:06:53.614 --> 02:06:55.532
-What is the matter with you?
-Gotta talk to you.

1497
02:06:56.533 --> 02:06:57.534
What's the matter?

1498
02:06:59.995 --> 02:07:00.996
Ernest.

1499
02:07:02.456 --> 02:07:05.375
I'm worried, King. They came to my house.
They came in the house.

1500
02:07:05.459 --> 02:07:06.460
Private investigators.

1501
02:07:09.379 --> 02:07:11.173
-Your house?
-My house, yeah.

1502
02:07:11.256 --> 02:07:13.258
-Who told you that?
-I don't know what they wanted.

1503
02:07:13.342 --> 02:07:15.093
They just-- They came to my house.

1504
02:07:15.177 --> 02:07:16.470
You-- What'd you do?

1505
02:07:16.553 --> 02:07:19.139
Look, I'm getting worried, all right?
They knew something.

1506
02:07:24.228 --> 02:07:25.938
-They're gonna know we did something.
-Settle down.

1507
02:07:26.021 --> 02:07:30.651
-King, we gotta talk about this right now.
-You've got to settle down. Settle down.

1508
02:07:30.734 --> 02:07:32.236
-Do you understand me?
-I do. I do.

1509
02:07:32.319 --> 02:07:33.820
-Get hold of yourself.
-I am.

1510
02:07:33.904 --> 02:07:37.074
-Get hold of yourself and settle down.
-I'm trying. I am trying, but you--

1511
02:07:37.157 --> 02:07:38.450
Settle down.

1512
02:07:38.534 --> 02:07:41.036
-When are we-- When are we gonna talk--
-Right now. Now. Now!

1513
02:07:41.119 --> 02:07:43.956
-We'll talk later. Not now. Not now.
-All right, all right.

1514
02:07:47.501 --> 02:07:48.836
-King, wha--
-Not now.

1515
02:08:20.367 --> 02:08:24.913
Are you here because McBride was killed?
That white man?

1516
02:08:25.747 --> 02:08:27.791
Or is it because we had to go
to Washington

1517
02:08:27.875 --> 02:08:32.337
and pay United States government $20,000
to get you here?

1518
02:08:34.756 --> 02:08:37.634
Well, I don't believe it's too late
to find out who's been doing this.

1519
02:08:38.719 --> 02:08:39.970
Who?

1520
02:08:40.053 --> 02:08:42.097
We have so many deaths, we've lost count.

1521
02:08:43.307 --> 02:08:44.641
We have hundreds down.

1522
02:08:44.725 --> 02:08:47.519
In the old days,
we would fight these people.

1523
02:08:47.603 --> 02:08:50.480
Twenty years ago, when I fought overseas
in the Boxer Rebellion,

1524
02:08:50.564 --> 02:08:53.400
I could see my enemy,
and I knew who I had to kill.

1525
02:08:54.318 --> 02:08:57.362
If we could find these people,
we would kill them.

1526
02:09:00.782 --> 02:09:04.620
No, no, no, no.
It's $25,000 come due on Henry Roan.

1527
02:09:04.703 --> 02:09:07.915
He's been dead months.
He's been dead months.

1528
02:09:07.998 --> 02:09:10.083
Please, just give me my Henry Roan money.

1529
02:09:10.167 --> 02:09:13.086
You're gonna have to argue that out
with Denver. They're contesting the claim.

1530
02:09:13.170 --> 02:09:15.464
-Who are you?
-I'm J.T. Jones, from the Denver office.

1531
02:09:15.547 --> 02:09:17.341
Well, J.T. Jones,
I want to tell you something.

1532
02:09:17.424 --> 02:09:20.511
This is a Fairfax problem.
It's not a Denver problem.

1533
02:09:20.594 --> 02:09:22.846
The claim went to Denver.
They are contesting it.

1534
02:09:22.930 --> 02:09:25.807
You keep saying Denver.
It's not Denver, it's Fairfax.

1535
02:09:25.891 --> 02:09:29.102
Now, I want my Roan money, please.
Write that note.

1536
02:09:29.186 --> 02:09:31.980
Mr. Hale, I'm sorry,
but until I hear from Denver, I can't--

1537
02:09:32.064 --> 02:09:34.358
-Do you know who I am?
-Yes, sir.

1538
02:09:34.441 --> 02:09:37.319
You're not gonna honor this?
You're not gonna give me that money?

1539
02:09:37.402 --> 02:09:39.738
-No, sir.
-Well, you're gonna regret this.

1540
02:09:39.821 --> 02:09:42.324
You're gonna regret this,
Mr. Insurance Man.

1541
02:09:45.869 --> 02:09:47.371
Gentlemen, come in.

1542
02:09:56.463 --> 02:09:58.799
-Hey, Mr. Hale?
-Yeah.

1543
02:09:58.882 --> 02:10:00.425
CJ Robinson's here to see you.

1544
02:10:00.509 --> 02:10:02.094
-Mr. Hale.
-CJ.

1545
02:10:03.846 --> 02:10:05.556
Wanna make a price on this?

1546
02:10:06.515 --> 02:10:09.643
Well, thought I'd take a look first.

1547
02:10:09.726 --> 02:10:11.395
All right. Make it quick. Not too long.

1548
02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.609
She has no face.

1549
02:10:19.278 --> 02:10:21.071
They took her head.

1550
02:10:21.655 --> 02:10:26.326
We didn't smoke her to the sky.
Wah-kon-tah won't know her.

1551
02:10:27.578 --> 02:10:29.288
We smoked the house.

1552
02:10:29.913 --> 02:10:33.333
We smoked the house, darling.
You just don't remember, that's all.

1553
02:10:34.084 --> 02:10:35.294
You don't remember.

1554
02:10:36.086 --> 02:10:41.091
We was there with Bill and Reta
and Joseph and Bertha.

1555
02:10:41.175 --> 02:10:44.261
We was all there together.
We was there together for hours.

1556
02:10:44.344 --> 02:10:46.847
It's just... You don't remember, that's all.

1557
02:10:59.484 --> 02:11:00.611
Mollie?

1558
02:11:10.662 --> 02:11:12.289
You just rest now.

1559
02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:21.965
James and David Shoun,
Bureau of Investigation.

1560
02:11:22.049 --> 02:11:24.760
We'd like to ask you a few questions
about the death of Anna Brown.

1561
02:11:27.012 --> 02:11:28.514
Get dressed. We'll be right back.

1562
02:11:32.100 --> 02:11:35.896
I think you need to see
the justice of the peace.

1563
02:11:35.979 --> 02:11:39.024
He has the inquest records
about Anna Brown's death.

1564
02:11:39.608 --> 02:11:41.735
Those records have gone missing
from his desk.

1565
02:11:42.402 --> 02:11:45.822
-So, then you need the undertaker, Turton.
-Turton.

1566
02:11:45.906 --> 02:11:50.160
Yeah, he has all the details
you might need.

1567
02:11:50.702 --> 02:11:53.705
-He kept the skull, didn't he, David?
-Yes, yes.

1568
02:11:53.789 --> 02:11:56.625
Seen him too,
and that's what brings us to you.

1569
02:11:57.793 --> 02:12:00.003
Possible you lost the bullet
that killed her?

1570
02:12:01.547 --> 02:12:04.091
Well, no, because we never found it.

1571
02:12:05.551 --> 02:12:08.637
That's why you were tearing up the brain,
looking for the bullet?

1572
02:12:10.013 --> 02:12:11.265
Yes, that's right.

1573
02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:15.727
The condition of the corpse was so bad
because she had been dead for five or--

1574
02:12:15.811 --> 02:12:18.063
-Six. Six days.
-Six days.

1575
02:12:18.146 --> 02:12:20.691
And then we exhumed her.

1576
02:12:22.067 --> 02:12:24.319
Why did you cut the body up
into small pieces

1577
02:12:24.403 --> 02:12:27.030
and cleave the flesh from the limbs
with a meat axe?

1578
02:12:27.573 --> 02:12:29.449
We were looking for the bullet.

1579
02:12:29.992 --> 02:12:31.076
Uh-huh.

1580
02:12:31.159 --> 02:12:34.121
We couldn't find it. Yeah.

1581
02:12:34.204 --> 02:12:37.165
You know, this is a matter
for the Indian tribal council.

1582
02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:38.625
You should see Chief...

1583
02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:40.127
-Bonnicastle.
-Bonnicastle.

1584
02:12:40.210 --> 02:12:41.461
What's he gonna tell me?

1585
02:12:42.045 --> 02:12:45.924
This is Indian country.
Go talk to the Indian.

1586
02:12:46.508 --> 02:12:48.010
Excuse us, gentlemen.

1587
02:12:48.844 --> 02:12:50.846
Well, well, well.

1588
02:12:51.889 --> 02:12:53.557
What took you so long to get here?

1589
02:12:55.017 --> 02:12:58.353
I was just assigned
to come down here a week ago.

1590
02:12:59.021 --> 02:13:00.564
Assigned by who? The president?

1591
02:13:00.647 --> 02:13:03.650
No, sir. By J. Edgar Hoover.

1592
02:13:03.734 --> 02:13:05.402
Well, I don't know him.

1593
02:13:08.322 --> 02:13:11.783
Well, I hear
you're the king of the Osage Hills,

1594
02:13:11.867 --> 02:13:14.369
and you might be the man to talk to.

1595
02:13:14.953 --> 02:13:16.580
I can give you my opinion.

1596
02:13:16.663 --> 02:13:19.249
Most likely this death business

1597
02:13:20.459 --> 02:13:25.088
is at the hands of a band of men from
outside these parts, possibly Nigras.

1598
02:13:25.756 --> 02:13:27.090
You saw what happened in Tulsa?

1599
02:13:27.841 --> 02:13:29.134
Yes, sir.

1600
02:13:29.218 --> 02:13:31.595
Then again, there's just bad luck.

1601
02:13:32.888 --> 02:13:37.518
Anna Brown, nasty mouth.
A friend, but a nasty mouth.

1602
02:13:37.601 --> 02:13:38.602
Bound to happen.

1603
02:13:39.186 --> 02:13:42.606
Henry Roan, he was a melancholic.
You must know that.

1604
02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:45.859
Then, of course,
there was Charlie Whitehorn,

1605
02:13:45.943 --> 02:13:47.903
one of the nicest people you'd ever know.

1606
02:13:48.529 --> 02:13:50.781
What about the other dead Osage?

1607
02:13:51.365 --> 02:13:54.826
-Twenty-five, it's gotta be almost 30 now.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1608
02:13:54.910 --> 02:13:58.539
It seems more like an epidemic
than bad luck to me.

1609
02:13:58.622 --> 02:14:01.959
Yeah, it seems to me you need to speak
with our justice of the peace.

1610
02:14:02.042 --> 02:14:06.463
I did. I visited with him
and he was not very helpful.

1611
02:14:06.547 --> 02:14:07.881
He wasn't?

1612
02:14:07.965 --> 02:14:09.258
Principal Chief?

1613
02:14:09.341 --> 02:14:10.759
I visited with him too.

1614
02:14:12.427 --> 02:14:14.638
They said to come see you.

1615
02:14:16.306 --> 02:14:18.725
Well, we want to put a finish
to this death business,

1616
02:14:18.809 --> 02:14:20.227
but this isn't the place to do it.

1617
02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:23.105
I'd be happy to talk to you and answer
any questions, whenever you have them.

1618
02:14:23.188 --> 02:14:26.859
We can meet somewhere else.
But here...? Not quite the place.

1619
02:14:28.527 --> 02:14:30.904
I guess I'll find you at a later date.

1620
02:14:31.530 --> 02:14:34.491
Thank you for your time,
and I'm sorry to disturb your shave.

1621
02:14:34.575 --> 02:14:38.620
That's all right. That's all right.
I'll wait to hear from you.

1622
02:14:54.386 --> 02:14:55.387
Hey, Blackie.

1623
02:14:56.722 --> 02:14:57.764
Don't turn.

1624
02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:02.561
Government men have been coming around.
Stirring.

1625
02:15:04.438 --> 02:15:05.689
I've done my time.

1626
02:15:06.732 --> 02:15:09.693
No use staying around someplace
when there's trouble.

1627
02:15:10.527 --> 02:15:13.071
I owe you for what you've done
for my nephew.

1628
02:15:13.989 --> 02:15:17.159
You stood pat on that roadster debacle.

1629
02:15:18.327 --> 02:15:22.956
Just spend time down someplace else.
Stay out of town.

1630
02:15:23.749 --> 02:15:25.709
That place might be Drumright.

1631
02:15:28.086 --> 02:15:29.546
-Drumright?
-Drumright.

1632
02:15:30.839 --> 02:15:35.302
Try and get there early.
Nigra janitor opens at sunrise.

1633
02:15:39.264 --> 02:15:41.225
Appreciate the payday.

1634
02:15:43.769 --> 02:15:45.354
Goddamnit!

1635
02:15:50.692 --> 02:15:52.528
-Hands in the air!
-Freeze! Don't you move!

1636
02:15:53.862 --> 02:15:54.863
Damn it.

1637
02:15:58.492 --> 02:16:01.995
Plié and straight. Plié and straight.

1638
02:16:02.079 --> 02:16:04.915
Thank you, Bill,
for your support of this town

1639
02:16:04.998 --> 02:16:07.334
and all the things you've done
for this community.

1640
02:16:07.417 --> 02:16:09.586
And now this beautiful dance school.

1641
02:16:10.546 --> 02:16:14.383
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Bill Hale, our sponsor.

1642
02:16:20.722 --> 02:16:25.018
We brought you an offering to invite you
into our home, to bless us with medicine.

1643
02:16:27.646 --> 02:16:28.939
You made this?

1644
02:16:29.523 --> 02:16:31.024
Did your girls get a pony?

1645
02:16:31.108 --> 02:16:33.777
-Yes, they did. Thank you, Bill.
-Course, course.

1646
02:16:35.445 --> 02:16:40.701
Bob, I'd like you to keep a watchful eye
on your business tonight.

1647
02:16:40.784 --> 02:16:45.372
Yeah, I've heard that they're setting up
a robbery of your store at 11:00 p.m.

1648
02:16:46.999 --> 02:16:49.668
So, maybe it's those gems you stashed.

1649
02:16:51.587 --> 02:16:52.921
Two whites and a Nigra.

1650
02:16:55.132 --> 02:16:56.383
Thank you, brother.

1651
02:16:57.384 --> 02:16:58.427
Course.

1652
02:17:02.931 --> 02:17:06.935
Acie, here's the rest I owe you,
with great appreciation.

1653
02:17:08.604 --> 02:17:10.939
You aware
there's federal agents around, right?

1654
02:17:11.773 --> 02:17:15.027
-Uh-huh.
-They're looking into that blast.

1655
02:17:16.528 --> 02:17:18.739
Well, this ain't federal land.
This is Indian land,

1656
02:17:18.822 --> 02:17:20.699
so there's no trouble that can come.

1657
02:17:26.246 --> 02:17:27.998
Good time to take a trip.

1658
02:17:29.875 --> 02:17:33.629
I have a nice opportunity for you
if you'll let me tell you of something.

1659
02:17:38.592 --> 02:17:40.594
-Sure.
-Okay.

1660
02:18:00.239 --> 02:18:01.240
C'mon!

1661
02:18:06.787 --> 02:18:09.164
Stop, you thieving bastards!

1662
02:18:32.312 --> 02:18:33.647
How do you do, sir?

1663
02:18:37.734 --> 02:18:39.361
Is this Henry Grammer's setup?

1664
02:18:40.279 --> 02:18:42.114
Any idea where we could find him?

1665
02:18:42.698 --> 02:18:47.286
An angel done come down and wrapped
her big old wings right in his chest.

1666
02:18:47.911 --> 02:18:49.913
Now he's down with the snakes.

1667
02:19:00.757 --> 02:19:01.842
When this happen?

1668
02:19:01.925 --> 02:19:03.218
Yesterday.

1669
02:19:14.479 --> 02:19:15.814
Put that away, brother.

1670
02:19:15.898 --> 02:19:17.733
-What?
-Come on outside.

1671
02:19:19.610 --> 02:19:21.028
Goddamn it. I quit.

1672
02:19:22.821 --> 02:19:23.906
What is it?

1673
02:19:25.699 --> 02:19:26.700
Hey, Byron.

1674
02:19:34.541 --> 02:19:35.584
What is it?

1675
02:19:36.168 --> 02:19:37.169
Ernest,

1676
02:19:38.170 --> 02:19:42.007
if you're charged, if anything happens,
you're gonna beat it. It's okay.

1677
02:19:42.591 --> 02:19:44.092
-What are you...
-You're gonna beat it.

1678
02:19:44.176 --> 02:19:45.552
What are you talking about?

1679
02:19:46.595 --> 02:19:48.931
What are they gonna charge me with?
What could they charge me with?

1680
02:19:49.014 --> 02:19:52.226
Ernest, I have many friends.
Many, many friends.

1681
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:54.603
That means I have the best attorneys.

1682
02:19:54.686 --> 02:19:57.606
They protect me,
and they're gonna protect you.

1683
02:19:57.689 --> 02:20:01.068
So you don't have to worry.
Nobody's coming after you, Son. Nobody.

1684
02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:02.945
Thank you, King.

1685
02:20:03.946 --> 02:20:05.489
-What?
-It's just a...

1686
02:20:05.572 --> 02:20:07.324
What? What is it? What?

1687
02:20:07.407 --> 02:20:08.909
His stomach's all torn up.

1688
02:20:09.535 --> 02:20:12.913
-You all right?
-Yeah, Myrtie's a mess.

1689
02:20:12.996 --> 02:20:17.251
Willie is hysterical. And I didn't--
I don't know how to--

1690
02:20:17.334 --> 02:20:19.336
I don't know what to do about it, but...

1691
02:20:20.838 --> 02:20:23.048
But you need to sign this here now.

1692
02:20:24.216 --> 02:20:27.094
Something happens to you,
the headrights got to stay in the family.

1693
02:20:27.177 --> 02:20:28.929
This is the only way to do it.

1694
02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:33.267
They got to stay in the family.
You know that.

1695
02:20:33.976 --> 02:20:37.062
Well, what if something happens to me--
What...

1696
02:20:38.313 --> 02:20:40.315
If something happens to me, what?
What would happen to me?

1697
02:20:40.399 --> 02:20:43.485
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
It's just a formality.

1698
02:20:43.569 --> 02:20:44.820
Nothing's gonna happen to you

1699
02:20:44.903 --> 02:20:47.781
because I'm gonna make sure
nothing's gonna happen to you.

1700
02:20:49.992 --> 02:20:51.618
You-- Did you sign this paper?

1701
02:20:51.702 --> 02:20:54.079
Oh, yeah, he signed it. Yeah, he signed.

1702
02:20:54.162 --> 02:20:55.497
My wife's not sick.

1703
02:20:56.415 --> 02:20:58.250
His wife's not sick, but he signed it.

1704
02:20:58.834 --> 02:21:00.419
We all have to sign this.

1705
02:21:00.502 --> 02:21:03.922
This way, for sure,
the money stays in the family.

1706
02:21:08.552 --> 02:21:09.595
Hey, Son...

1707
02:21:10.137 --> 02:21:11.388
Hey, Byron, give us a minute.

1708
02:21:11.471 --> 02:21:12.639
Sure, King.

1709
02:21:19.271 --> 02:21:20.314
You all right?

1710
02:21:20.397 --> 02:21:21.982
Yeah, I'm...

1711
02:21:23.066 --> 02:21:26.028
I'm fine, I guess.

1712
02:21:26.111 --> 02:21:28.947
You're not afraid?
'Cause there's no reason to be afraid.

1713
02:21:29.031 --> 02:21:30.032
No, I'm not...

1714
02:21:32.492 --> 02:21:34.119
You giving her the shots?

1715
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:36.079
Shots? Yeah.

1716
02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:40.042
Yeah, I'm doing what I'm supposed
to be doing.

1717
02:21:40.125 --> 02:21:41.251
Giving her all of it?

1718
02:21:41.335 --> 02:21:43.045
Yeah. Yeah.

1719
02:21:44.171 --> 02:21:46.423
You just gotta remember
to give her all of it.

1720
02:21:46.507 --> 02:21:47.966
I am, King. I am.

1721
02:21:48.509 --> 02:21:52.804
I'm doing like we said.
I'm keeping her quiet. She's quiet.

1722
02:21:52.888 --> 02:21:54.139
Well, just make sure you do it.

1723
02:21:55.933 --> 02:22:00.646
Now, Ernest, I know you love Mollie,
and I know I love her too.

1724
02:22:00.729 --> 02:22:02.564
But the truth is

1725
02:22:03.815 --> 02:22:05.192
she gonna pass on.

1726
02:22:07.653 --> 02:22:08.737
You know that.

1727
02:22:09.404 --> 02:22:11.949
There's nothing we can do about that.
It's in God's hands.

1728
02:22:12.866 --> 02:22:14.493
And he's waiting on her now.

1729
02:22:17.412 --> 02:22:22.209
Now, you got to stay by her side and
give her this medicine to ease her pain.

1730
02:22:22.835 --> 02:22:24.837
And you're never gonna regret

1731
02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:28.507
spending this time with her
before she returns to the eternal.

1732
02:22:28.590 --> 02:22:30.217
You're never gonna regret that.

1733
02:22:32.302 --> 02:22:33.679
And you're strong now.

1734
02:22:35.097 --> 02:22:36.682
Right? You're strong.

1735
02:22:36.765 --> 02:22:37.766
Yeah.

1736
02:22:38.517 --> 02:22:40.143
Be there for her.

1737
02:22:42.563 --> 02:22:44.189
And you need to sign this.

1738
02:22:49.903 --> 02:22:52.656
-You want me to sign that?
-You have to sign it, Son.

1739
02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:56.368
All right, King.

1740
02:23:31.904 --> 02:23:33.030
Evening, boys.

1741
02:23:34.156 --> 02:23:35.240
John.

1742
02:23:37.034 --> 02:23:39.077
This is what I got so far.

1743
02:23:39.161 --> 02:23:42.915
I was over in Ralston yesterday.

1744
02:23:42.998 --> 02:23:45.501
I met this old-timer
by the name of Alvin Reynolds.

1745
02:23:46.585 --> 02:23:48.712
Told me a lot.

1746
02:23:49.421 --> 02:23:51.590
I knew every Indian they murdered.

1747
02:23:52.591 --> 02:23:57.137
That bunch would give poisoned liquor
to dogs just to see what would happen.

1748
02:23:57.763 --> 02:23:59.556
They'd even kill coyotes.

1749
02:24:00.516 --> 02:24:02.351
I don't care so much about coyotes,

1750
02:24:02.434 --> 02:24:06.271
but it ain't right to kill 'em like that
when they could have a natural death.

1751
02:24:06.355 --> 02:24:09.858
My son-in-law tells me
I ought to keep quiet

1752
02:24:09.942 --> 02:24:12.319
or that bunch will come after me
and kill me too.

1753
02:24:12.402 --> 02:24:15.989
But my time is up already,
so I'm gonna tell you who did it.

1754
02:24:18.075 --> 02:24:19.785
I was sitting right here,

1755
02:24:20.494 --> 02:24:25.332
and I saw Byron Burkhart
driving Anna Brown right down this road.

1756
02:24:29.002 --> 02:24:31.672
Kelsie Morrison and his wife
was in the back seat.

1757
02:24:32.673 --> 02:24:35.843
They took Anna and got her good and drunk.

1758
02:24:35.926 --> 02:24:40.430
And they were all together.
Kelsie, Byron and Anna.

1759
02:24:41.348 --> 02:24:42.558
I ain't lying.

1760
02:24:43.225 --> 02:24:44.351
Kelsie Morrison?

1761
02:24:46.770 --> 02:24:51.900
Kelsie Morrison runs dope and whiskey
from Fort Worth to New Orleans to Dallas.

1762
02:24:52.776 --> 02:24:55.696
You remember Bill Stepson,
the rodeo roper?

1763
02:24:55.779 --> 02:24:59.241
Bill Stepson died of corn whiskey.
There was no investigation.

1764
02:25:00.158 --> 02:25:01.869
Bill's wife was Tillie Stepson.

1765
02:25:02.953 --> 02:25:06.164
Kelsie drops his first wife Catherine

1766
02:25:06.248 --> 02:25:09.501
and marries Tillie
two weeks after Bill dies.

1767
02:25:12.212 --> 02:25:14.965
Two months after that,
Tillie dies from poison.

1768
02:25:15.883 --> 02:25:18.218
Kelsie runs off with Tillie's kids
down to Mexico,

1769
02:25:18.302 --> 02:25:20.554
but he comes back
'cause some smart lawyer tells him

1770
02:25:20.637 --> 02:25:22.681
he's gonna be in much bigger trouble
if he doesn't.

1771
02:25:25.475 --> 02:25:29.229
So my dead wife has two kids,
and they have my name.

1772
02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:33.025
So, if I adopted them proper,

1773
02:25:33.108 --> 02:25:36.528
and if these two kids were to die,
would I inherit their estates?

1774
02:25:36.653 --> 02:25:37.821
They're Osage.

1775
02:25:37.905 --> 02:25:40.908
Well, one of them's half Osage,
but they have headrights.

1776
02:25:42.117 --> 02:25:44.912
Kelsie, you realize
that this indicates to me

1777
02:25:44.995 --> 02:25:47.873
that you're planning on adopting
and killing these children?

1778
02:25:48.582 --> 02:25:51.793
No, not if it's not legal
and I don't get the money.

1779
02:25:51.877 --> 02:25:53.295
Then I'm not gonna do it.

1780
02:26:01.970 --> 02:26:03.222
Kelsie Morrison?

1781
02:26:03.847 --> 02:26:06.058
-Who?
-Kelsie Morrison.

1782
02:26:06.141 --> 02:26:07.809
My name is Lloyd Miller.

1783
02:26:07.893 --> 02:26:10.479
Come on over here, Lloyd.
We wanna talk to you about that.

1784
02:26:13.774 --> 02:26:15.943
I always admired Kelsie's ambition.

1785
02:26:17.653 --> 02:26:18.946
Told him so, and he thanked me.

1786
02:26:19.029 --> 02:26:21.823
Kelsie, I have always admired
your ambition.

1787
02:26:21.907 --> 02:26:22.950
Thank you.

1788
02:26:23.033 --> 02:26:26.662
What can you tell us about Byron
and Ernest Burkhart and those murders?

1789
02:26:27.913 --> 02:26:29.331
Byron and Ernest Burkhart?

1790
02:26:31.083 --> 02:26:33.043
I think we can help each other out here.

1791
02:26:36.713 --> 02:26:41.593
I'm in real good with the people now.
The Wahzhazhe, they tell me things.

1792
02:26:43.178 --> 02:26:46.348
I'm a trusted friend of Father Albert too.
He confided in me.

1793
02:26:47.224 --> 02:26:50.018
Told me everything that was going on
with Mollie Burkhart.

1794
02:26:52.104 --> 02:26:53.564
Said she fears for her life.

1795
02:26:56.108 --> 02:26:58.110
He say who she was most afraid of?

1796
02:27:02.698 --> 02:27:03.907
Come on now, Tom.

1797
02:27:05.742 --> 02:27:08.537
You got a better chance of
convicting a guy for kicking a dog

1798
02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:10.038
than killing an Indian.

1799
02:27:24.845 --> 02:27:26.263
That's Bill Hale's ranch.

1800
02:27:39.484 --> 02:27:42.154
I sold him a $30,000 fire policy
last month.

1801
02:27:43.530 --> 02:27:46.575
Well, Mr. Insurance Man, looks like
you got some work in the morning.

1802
02:30:22.314 --> 02:30:23.941
You're next.

1803
02:31:31.675 --> 02:31:32.718
Well...

1804
02:31:35.053 --> 02:31:36.513
here we go.

1805
02:31:38.056 --> 02:31:40.559
Here we go, huh? Well...

1806
02:31:41.768 --> 02:31:43.187
I got something to tell you.

1807
02:31:43.979 --> 02:31:44.980
You...

1808
02:31:46.607 --> 02:31:51.236
I got something to tell you.
My wife's real sick.

1809
02:31:51.320 --> 02:31:55.908
I gotta get home and see my wife.
She's real sick.

1810
02:31:55.991 --> 02:31:58.076
Son? Come with me now.

1811
02:31:59.453 --> 02:32:04.124
Gotta go talk to my wife.
She's not doing too well, so...

1812
02:32:05.042 --> 02:32:06.668
We're gonna go home, and...

1813
02:32:07.419 --> 02:32:09.755
We're gonna go home
and take care of her, right?

1814
02:32:09.838 --> 02:32:11.507
-All right, Son.
-Boy.

1815
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:15.010
You got this all wrong.
You got this all wrong.

1816
02:32:15.093 --> 02:32:17.221
Whatever you think you know,
you don't know.

1817
02:32:18.764 --> 02:32:21.183
-Son, you go with him, all right?
-All right.

1818
02:32:22.142 --> 02:32:23.852
My wife, she's real sick!

1819
02:32:24.978 --> 02:32:26.188
Been real sick.

1820
02:32:35.656 --> 02:32:36.865
Can I...

1821
02:32:39.117 --> 02:32:40.327
Can I sit down?

1822
02:32:42.579 --> 02:32:43.789
Standing's good.

1823
02:32:51.797 --> 02:32:56.009
Wanna talk to you about the murders
of Reta and Bill Smith, and Anna Brown.

1824
02:33:17.531 --> 02:33:19.157
I need to sit down.

1825
02:33:20.492 --> 02:33:22.953
Yes, you do. But you're standing.

1826
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:26.248
I'm standing now,

1827
02:33:28.083 --> 02:33:29.918
but I'm gonna have to get some sleep.

1828
02:33:32.171 --> 02:33:36.216
You can't be holding me here
like this much longer.

1829
02:33:38.093 --> 02:33:41.305
Were you alone when you put the explosives
under the house

1830
02:33:41.388 --> 02:33:43.098
or was Blackie Thompson with you?

1831
02:33:45.642 --> 02:33:46.852
Who?

1832
02:33:46.935 --> 02:33:48.437
Blackie Thompson.

1833
02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:50.355
No. He was nowhere around me.

1834
02:33:53.525 --> 02:33:58.447
I don't even know him so much,
just from around town. That's all.

1835
02:34:01.867 --> 02:34:04.077
And did you put the explosives
under the house?

1836
02:34:04.161 --> 02:34:06.496
I don't know nothing about no explosives.

1837
02:34:14.922 --> 02:34:17.257
You didn't rob a bank in Oilton with him,
did you?

1838
02:34:18.050 --> 02:34:19.051
No.

1839
02:34:20.928 --> 02:34:24.765
You did help Blackie Thompson

1840
02:34:24.848 --> 02:34:28.727
steal your own Buick in 1921

1841
02:34:28.810 --> 02:34:32.564
for the purposes of collecting
insurance money on it, didn't you?

1842
02:34:33.690 --> 02:34:34.733
You didn't?

1843
02:34:35.651 --> 02:34:38.529
I let him use my bucket for a while,
but that's--

1844
02:34:39.154 --> 02:34:41.782
I told him he could ride around. But...

1845
02:34:42.699 --> 02:34:43.909
What did he want it for?

1846
02:34:43.992 --> 02:34:45.702
I don't know what he wanted it fer.

1847
02:34:47.204 --> 02:34:50.874
That ain't my business.
Probably to enjoy hisself.

1848
02:34:52.334 --> 02:34:56.547
If a man wanted to borrow my car,
I might ask him what he wanted it for.

1849
02:34:58.257 --> 02:35:03.762
Sometimes people just wanna take a ride.
I don't ask no questions.

1850
02:35:05.055 --> 02:35:09.977
So you loaned it to him?
You didn't ask him what it was for?

1851
02:35:12.104 --> 02:35:13.105
Yeah.

1852
02:35:14.398 --> 02:35:16.567
Just a neighborly guy.

1853
02:35:17.317 --> 02:35:21.363
You got me. I loaned it to him.

1854
02:35:24.032 --> 02:35:26.869
I loaned it to him.
I guess that's against the law, right?

1855
02:35:27.494 --> 02:35:28.495
All right.

1856
02:35:36.837 --> 02:35:38.422
How are you doing, Ernest?

1857
02:35:42.843 --> 02:35:43.969
Blackie.

1858
02:35:54.062 --> 02:35:55.856
May I talk to this man?

1859
02:35:57.149 --> 02:36:00.485
May I talk to this man alone for a while?

1860
02:36:06.992 --> 02:36:08.660
They got you turned around?

1861
02:36:10.245 --> 02:36:11.663
Me turned around?

1862
02:36:12.623 --> 02:36:14.708
No, they ain't got me turned around,
Blackie.

1863
02:36:16.877 --> 02:36:20.839
Go on now. What'd you tell 'em?
What'd you tell 'em?

1864
02:36:20.923 --> 02:36:24.885
I told them when I came out of prison,
to make things right with you,

1865
02:36:24.968 --> 02:36:26.136
you gave me $1.50.

1866
02:36:27.387 --> 02:36:29.932
You just told us we all knew
the chances we were taking.

1867
02:36:30.015 --> 02:36:32.184
Yeah, we did.
We knew the chances we were taking.

1868
02:36:32.267 --> 02:36:34.561
But I didn't give you $1.50,
I gave you a twenty.

1869
02:36:34.645 --> 02:36:36.104
No, you didn't. It was $1.50.

1870
02:36:36.188 --> 02:36:39.358
I didn't give you $1.50. I gave you a t--
I meant to give you a tw--

1871
02:36:39.441 --> 02:36:42.778
Nah, I did give you a twenty.
No, I remember now. I gave you a twenty.

1872
02:36:42.861 --> 02:36:44.279
-Bullshit.
-Listen.

1873
02:36:46.198 --> 02:36:50.911
You gotta tell me what you told them,
Blackie. All of it. What you tell them?

1874
02:36:50.994 --> 02:36:52.663
-I told them all of it.
-All of it?

1875
02:36:52.746 --> 02:36:56.416
I told all of it. I told them how you
and your uncle are too much goddamn Jew.

1876
02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:58.001
Jew?

1877
02:36:58.085 --> 02:37:00.796
Yeah, I'm sitting here doing life
for that Drumright cop.

1878
02:37:00.879 --> 02:37:05.467
Well, I'm telling you right now, Ernest.
You can't handle any prison, boy.

1879
02:37:05.551 --> 02:37:07.302
You're better off telling them
what you know,

1880
02:37:07.386 --> 02:37:10.472
for your sake, for your family's sake,
and for your pleasure.

1881
02:37:10.556 --> 02:37:13.392
You know something.
Youse is as dumb as a washboard.

1882
02:37:13.475 --> 02:37:14.643
-You know that?
-Am I?

1883
02:37:14.726 --> 02:37:17.896
Yeah, you go on yapping
first chance you get, huh, Blackie?

1884
02:37:17.980 --> 02:37:21.567
We were supposed to be partners.
It ain't my fault that you--

1885
02:37:21.650 --> 02:37:22.651
Partners?

1886
02:37:22.734 --> 02:37:24.987
It ain't my fault you got caught
with the car, you dumbbell.

1887
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:27.781
Call me a goddamn partner?
You didn't give me shit.

1888
02:37:27.865 --> 02:37:30.409
Let me tell you something.
Hale's got a whole plan.

1889
02:37:30.492 --> 02:37:33.328
And I'm gonna talk to him,
make sure you ain't a part of it

1890
02:37:33.412 --> 02:37:35.080
'cause you're so thick in the head.

1891
02:37:35.163 --> 02:37:37.624
He always said you was thick in the head.
You know that?

1892
02:37:37.708 --> 02:37:40.878
This is the plan.
I'm sitting here because of his plan.

1893
02:37:56.560 --> 02:37:57.561
Mollie...

1894
02:38:11.283 --> 02:38:14.536
Are you real?

1895
02:38:18.165 --> 02:38:19.458
I could be real.

1896
02:38:38.769 --> 02:38:40.604
All right, all right. That's enough.

1897
02:38:46.193 --> 02:38:48.362
Ernest, you're a good man, aren't you?

1898
02:38:49.905 --> 02:38:52.908
Yes, sir. I am. I suppose so.

1899
02:38:54.326 --> 02:38:56.828
You suppose so? Are you or aren't you?

1900
02:38:57.788 --> 02:38:59.998
I am, sir. I am.

1901
02:39:00.082 --> 02:39:01.708
You love your wife and children?

1902
02:39:03.043 --> 02:39:04.086
Yes, sir. I do.

1903
02:39:04.169 --> 02:39:05.921
You served your country in infantry,

1904
02:39:06.755 --> 02:39:09.591
and I don't think this is how your life
was meant to turn out.

1905
02:39:13.178 --> 02:39:18.225
Now, it seems to me your family back home,

1906
02:39:19.726 --> 02:39:24.356
they're more of a blessing to you
than your uncle, King Bill Hale.

1907
02:39:27.484 --> 02:39:32.364
You and I both know he presents himself
as a very righteous man.

1908
02:39:35.826 --> 02:39:37.369
And that's just not who he is.

1909
02:39:41.582 --> 02:39:43.250
He's done nothing for you, son...

1910
02:39:45.294 --> 02:39:46.420
except...

1911
02:39:47.629 --> 02:39:52.968
make you do bad things and take advantage
of you because of your... disposition.

1912
02:39:59.391 --> 02:40:01.018
So what do you say we start over?

1913
02:40:05.731 --> 02:40:06.773
I...

1914
02:40:10.277 --> 02:40:12.404
I wanna get home to see my wife,

1915
02:40:14.239 --> 02:40:15.532
so you...

1916
02:40:17.492 --> 02:40:19.244
you tell me what I gotta do.

1917
02:40:22.998 --> 02:40:25.501
You know who killed Henry Roan?

1918
02:40:38.055 --> 02:40:39.264
Don't you run now.

1919
02:40:43.393 --> 02:40:44.645
I'm here to take you in.

1920
02:41:00.452 --> 02:41:02.829
I understand you know something
about the Henry Roan murder?

1921
02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:07.501
Why, I don't know nothing about it.

1922
02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:13.215
Well, I have a man here
who says he's your friend,

1923
02:41:13.298 --> 02:41:15.133
who says you do know something about it.

1924
02:41:16.552 --> 02:41:17.594
Who is he?

1925
02:41:39.741 --> 02:41:41.368
So this is on my neck?

1926
02:41:43.453 --> 02:41:44.496
Yes, sir.

1927
02:41:51.795 --> 02:41:53.088
Get your pencils.

1928
02:42:09.229 --> 02:42:11.732
Where's my husband?

1929
02:42:12.357 --> 02:42:13.734
Does she have a doctor?

1930
02:42:13.817 --> 02:42:15.527
No. She won't see one.

1931
02:42:16.361 --> 02:42:17.779
Let's take her.

1932
02:42:21.033 --> 02:42:22.075
Are you real?

1933
02:42:23.076 --> 02:42:24.077
Ready?

1934
02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:30.959
Ma'am.

1935
02:42:31.877 --> 02:42:34.421
Where's my husband?

1936
02:42:35.547 --> 02:42:36.715
We're gonna get you some help.

1937
02:42:53.565 --> 02:42:55.567
Mrs. Burkhart. Mrs. Burkhart.

1938
02:42:55.651 --> 02:42:56.860
I need heroin, two milligrams.

1939
02:43:02.658 --> 02:43:03.867
You want protection?

1940
02:43:10.666 --> 02:43:11.667
From who?

1941
02:43:13.585 --> 02:43:14.670
From my...

1942
02:43:16.088 --> 02:43:17.297
From my uncle.

1943
02:43:22.302 --> 02:43:23.846
-Hey, Harve.
-Bill.

1944
02:43:25.389 --> 02:43:30.227
I understand I'm wanted.
Well, I'm here to turn myself in.

1945
02:43:30.310 --> 02:43:32.062
What you supposed to have done?

1946
02:43:32.145 --> 02:43:33.689
Killed somebody, if you can believe it.

1947
02:43:33.772 --> 02:43:35.774
Now, Bill, I wouldn't go that far.

1948
02:43:35.858 --> 02:43:36.817
Arrest me, son.

1949
02:43:38.527 --> 02:43:41.280
-We don't need to do that.
-It's all right. Come on, son.

1950
02:43:41.405 --> 02:43:44.449
-Mr. Hale, have you a statement to make?
-Mr. Hale!

1951
02:43:44.533 --> 02:43:48.453
-What do you know about the murders?
-Just a statement? Just, "I'm innocent"?

1952
02:43:48.537 --> 02:43:52.249
Innocent as a newborn baby. Even more.

1953
02:43:52.332 --> 02:43:53.417
Mr. Hale! Mr. Hale!

1954
02:43:53.500 --> 02:43:55.419
When am I gonna get to talk to my wife?

1955
02:43:55.502 --> 02:43:57.546
You told me if I testified,
I could see my wife.

1956
02:43:57.629 --> 02:43:59.923
Well, she is in the hospital in Pawhuska
right now.

1957
02:44:00.007 --> 02:44:02.676
She's in the hospital? Is she all right?

1958
02:44:03.218 --> 02:44:04.428
She doesn't seem it.

1959
02:44:04.970 --> 02:44:07.055
You tell her I wanna get a letter to her.

1960
02:44:07.139 --> 02:44:08.599
Where they taking you, Mr. Burkhart?

1961
02:44:08.682 --> 02:44:11.518
I'm going the other way for a while now.

1962
02:44:11.602 --> 02:44:12.769
Where are they taking you, sir?

1963
02:44:15.856 --> 02:44:17.107
Where are you taking me?

1964
02:44:17.191 --> 02:44:20.485
We're not charging you with anything
because you're going to testify.

1965
02:44:20.569 --> 02:44:22.654
I know you wanna get back
to Mollie and the kids,

1966
02:44:22.779 --> 02:44:25.157
but right now it's best
we take you out of state for a while,

1967
02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:27.159
keep Hale and his wolves at bay.

1968
02:44:27.242 --> 02:44:28.285
Understand?

1969
02:44:40.547 --> 02:44:43.175
Just for the record,
where are you currently residing?

1970
02:44:43.258 --> 02:44:44.676
Penitentiary.

1971
02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:46.220
Serving for how long?

1972
02:44:46.303 --> 02:44:47.554
Got a life sentence.

1973
02:44:47.638 --> 02:44:50.057
-For the Drumright job, right?
-Yes, sir.

1974
02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:53.352
And that was William Hale
that arranged that, right?

1975
02:44:53.435 --> 02:44:57.397
That he did. Yeah, that he did.
Funny, ain't it?

1976
02:44:58.273 --> 02:44:59.274
Take a letter.

1977
02:45:00.359 --> 02:45:03.987
"Judge not" by William K. Hale.

1978
02:45:04.071 --> 02:45:06.740
Who asked you to kill Bill and Reta Smith?

1979
02:45:07.783 --> 02:45:09.535
William Hale and Ernest Burkhart.

1980
02:45:10.494 --> 02:45:12.704
Have you had any recent contact
with Mr. Hale?

1981
02:45:12.788 --> 02:45:15.374
Yeah, I have. Matter of fact, I have.

1982
02:45:15.457 --> 02:45:17.501
He got a note to my jail cell.

1983
02:45:18.210 --> 02:45:20.504
Asked me to kill his nephew, Ernest.

1984
02:45:21.588 --> 02:45:22.589
Mr. Thompson.

1985
02:45:22.673 --> 02:45:25.509
The vilest criminal
may rightfully demand a chance

1986
02:45:25.592 --> 02:45:28.637
to prove his innocence
by a jury of his land. Judge not.

1987
02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:32.307
Yeah, he got a note to my jail cell
saying he could help me exscape.

1988
02:45:32.391 --> 02:45:37.020
And when I got out, take his nephew Ernest
to old Mexico and kill him.

1989
02:45:37.104 --> 02:45:40.691
I sent a note back saying
that I wouldn't testify if he got me out.

1990
02:45:41.316 --> 02:45:42.818
And how did that work out for you?

1991
02:45:42.901 --> 02:45:44.486
How did what work out for me?

1992
02:45:45.195 --> 02:45:47.364
Mr. Hale's promise for a grand escape.

1993
02:45:47.447 --> 02:45:49.992
Shit, I'm sitting here talking to you,
ain't I?

1994
02:45:50.075 --> 02:45:51.743
Damn, it didn't work out too well.

1995
02:45:51.827 --> 02:45:53.829
Judge not.

1996
02:45:54.746 --> 02:45:57.791
Put that in the Pawhuska Daily Journal,
Fairfax Chief,

1997
02:45:57.875 --> 02:45:59.960
The Hominy Journal,
and The Osage County News.

1998
02:46:00.043 --> 02:46:01.044
Yes, Mr. Hale.

1999
02:46:04.214 --> 02:46:05.465
Your mama's walking.

2000
02:46:08.343 --> 02:46:09.761
Doesn't she look wonderful?

2001
02:46:17.519 --> 02:46:18.896
Hold steady, son.

2002
02:46:20.564 --> 02:46:21.815
Narrow is the way.

2003
02:47:02.606 --> 02:47:06.109
I demand to confer privately
with Mr. Burkhart!

2004
02:47:06.193 --> 02:47:07.402
This is unheard of.

2005
02:47:07.486 --> 02:47:10.197
Ernest Burkhart is my client!

2006
02:47:10.280 --> 02:47:11.698
The rules prohibit this.

2007
02:47:11.782 --> 02:47:14.826
I demand the opportunity
to speak with Mr. Burkhart!

2008
02:47:14.910 --> 02:47:18.205
This man cannot represent
both the defendant and the witness.

2009
02:47:18.288 --> 02:47:19.581
It is a conflict.

2010
02:47:19.665 --> 02:47:22.084
He has been missing for two months!

2011
02:47:22.709 --> 02:47:27.172
And I have not had a chance to communicate
with him before he testifies!

2012
02:47:27.256 --> 02:47:29.591
This is tantamount to witness tampering!

2013
02:47:29.675 --> 02:47:33.637
Mr. Burkhart,
is this man really your attorney?

2014
02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:35.389
I don't know.

2015
02:47:37.140 --> 02:47:39.142
I don't have a contract with him,

2016
02:47:41.103 --> 02:47:42.855
but I'm willing to talk to him. Yeah.

2017
02:47:43.647 --> 02:47:46.567
The rules prohibit this, Your Honor.

2018
02:47:46.650 --> 02:47:48.902
The prosecution will not allow

2019
02:47:48.986 --> 02:47:52.114
any conference between Mr. Hamilton
and this witness

2020
02:47:52.197 --> 02:47:54.408
before the beginning of these proceedings!

2021
02:47:56.451 --> 02:47:58.287
The Wahzhazhe people deserve justice!

2022
02:47:58.370 --> 02:48:00.914
Give him to us! I'll be his executioner!

2023
02:48:00.998 --> 02:48:04.376
Mr. Burkhart will be remanded over
to the custody of the marshals.

2024
02:48:04.459 --> 02:48:06.253
Marshals, get him out of here.

2025
02:48:06.336 --> 02:48:09.756
Court is adjourned until
ten o'clock tomorrow. Clear the courtroom.

2026
02:48:48.879 --> 02:48:50.172
I'm sorry...

2027
02:48:52.591 --> 02:48:53.926
for all troubles.

2028
02:49:08.524 --> 02:49:11.026
I'll take you home now.

2029
02:49:26.458 --> 02:49:27.459
Brother.

2030
02:49:28.961 --> 02:49:30.212
Brother.

2031
02:49:33.465 --> 02:49:36.009
Freeling and Hamilton wanna see you
at Hale's tonight.

2032
02:49:36.635 --> 02:49:37.845
Talk things over.

2033
02:50:04.872 --> 02:50:06.290
Sheriff.

2034
02:50:06.373 --> 02:50:07.457
Ernest.

2035
02:50:08.041 --> 02:50:09.293
Aunt Myrtie.

2036
02:50:14.381 --> 02:50:18.844
Ernest, you know Mr. Solowey, Solowey Oil?

2037
02:50:18.927 --> 02:50:22.431
And, of course, Mr. Kraceon, Kraceon Oil.

2038
02:50:25.767 --> 02:50:27.227
Here. Come sit.

2039
02:50:31.899 --> 02:50:33.942
If you testify against your uncle,

2040
02:50:34.026 --> 02:50:38.989
you realize that this can be held
against you for the rest of your life

2041
02:50:39.781 --> 02:50:42.868
and you can be convicted
for the Smith murder,

2042
02:50:42.951 --> 02:50:46.663
spend the rest of your days in prison?
Do you see that?

2043
02:50:48.582 --> 02:50:51.752
No, I suppose I didn't
think that through too much. But...

2044
02:50:51.835 --> 02:50:56.632
They're giving you the rope
to hang yourself. Do you see that?

2045
02:50:56.715 --> 02:51:00.052
He doesn't see that. He doesn't see that.

2046
02:51:00.135 --> 02:51:01.845
-Ernest!
-Yeah. Yeah.

2047
02:51:02.513 --> 02:51:06.099
If you do this,
you will be murdering your uncle.

2048
02:51:06.183 --> 02:51:09.186
Ernest, you wanna do that,

2049
02:51:09.728 --> 02:51:13.357
have him die in prison, do you, Ernest?

2050
02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:17.486
No. Course I don't want that, Myrtie.
You know I don't want that.

2051
02:51:17.569 --> 02:51:21.490
Yes. You have all the power
to save his life.

2052
02:51:21.573 --> 02:51:24.868
He is saving you, dumb boy!

2053
02:51:35.504 --> 02:51:37.297
Do you wanna go home right now?

2054
02:51:37.881 --> 02:51:39.049
Yes. Yes, I do.

2055
02:51:39.132 --> 02:51:41.176
-Wanna see your wife and kids?
-Yes, sir, I do.

2056
02:51:43.554 --> 02:51:45.347
These government men,

2057
02:51:46.807 --> 02:51:50.435
they beat you and they tortured you.

2058
02:51:50.519 --> 02:51:54.064
Well, no. No, they didn't.
But they did keep me up for days.

2059
02:51:54.147 --> 02:51:57.693
No! They beat you! They beat you!

2060
02:51:57.776 --> 02:52:00.445
-Yes, they beat me. They beat me, sir.
-Thank you.

2061
02:52:08.161 --> 02:52:09.371
I had a dream.

2062
02:52:10.038 --> 02:52:11.081
Oh, yeah?

2063
02:52:11.748 --> 02:52:13.625
We went to Colorado Springs.

2064
02:52:15.460 --> 02:52:20.465
You told me all your secrets,
and I held them in a box for you.

2065
02:52:22.134 --> 02:52:25.137
Then we went to the river
and dumped them all away.

2066
02:52:28.140 --> 02:52:29.558
We were happy there.

2067
02:52:32.060 --> 02:52:35.480
Did I tell you how beautiful you look now?
Look at you.

2068
02:52:38.942 --> 02:52:39.985
You're glowing.

2069
02:52:41.987 --> 02:52:44.531
The insulin is working, ain't it?

2070
02:52:45.949 --> 02:52:49.328
I told you. You gotta get worse
before you get better.

2071
02:52:51.538 --> 02:52:52.998
What's gonna come now?

2072
02:52:53.874 --> 02:52:58.504
All I know, Mollie,
is it's real complicated.

2073
02:52:59.254 --> 02:53:02.132
White men's laws, they're ju--

2074
02:53:03.133 --> 02:53:06.553
Sometimes you gotta do one thing,
even though you mean to do another thing.

2075
02:53:08.138 --> 02:53:11.934
And I know that's hard for you
to understand as Osage, but...

2076
02:53:12.017 --> 02:53:16.313
What I have to do is go now
and tell the real truth,

2077
02:53:17.022 --> 02:53:20.651
the real truth about what these government
men have done to make me lie to them.

2078
02:53:22.152 --> 02:53:24.363
You know they beat me, right, Mollie?

2079
02:53:24.446 --> 02:53:26.198
They beat me. They tortured me.

2080
02:53:26.281 --> 02:53:29.868
They kept me up for days
so I would make up these lies

2081
02:53:30.953 --> 02:53:34.248
and say that my uncle did
these awful things. It's...

2082
02:53:35.916 --> 02:53:37.668
I'm in my right way now.

2083
02:53:38.460 --> 02:53:39.920
I'm in my right way,

2084
02:53:40.838 --> 02:53:43.423
and I'm not gonna say those lies.
I'm gonna do the right thing,

2085
02:53:43.507 --> 02:53:46.385
and I'm gonna protect my uncle
'cause he needs protection.

2086
02:53:50.180 --> 02:53:51.181
What?

2087
02:53:53.350 --> 02:53:54.518
What is it?

2088
02:53:57.521 --> 02:53:58.981
When will you come back?

2089
02:54:04.027 --> 02:54:05.237
Couple days.

2090
02:54:06.530 --> 02:54:08.407
I'm gonna come back in a couple days.

2091
02:54:09.616 --> 02:54:11.159
Now, listen,

2092
02:54:11.743 --> 02:54:15.956
they're gonna arrest me and all that
just to make a show of it.

2093
02:54:17.291 --> 02:54:19.459
But I'm not in any kind of trouble at all.

2094
02:54:20.169 --> 02:54:21.253
None at all.

2095
02:54:23.338 --> 02:54:25.549
I haven't done nothing wrong
in this world.

2096
02:54:27.176 --> 02:54:29.219
They can arrest me all they want.

2097
02:54:34.391 --> 02:54:36.101
Just make sure you know the road.

2098
02:54:48.614 --> 02:54:50.449
You gonna testify for us?

2099
02:54:50.532 --> 02:54:51.909
No, sir, I will not.

2100
02:54:53.785 --> 02:54:56.330
You've decided not to testify
for the government?

2101
02:54:56.413 --> 02:54:59.791
That's right.
What I told y'all was a pack of lies.

2102
02:54:59.875 --> 02:55:01.126
All right. You turn around.

2103
02:55:02.586 --> 02:55:05.214
You're under arrest
for the murder of Reta and Bill Smith.

2104
02:55:17.100 --> 02:55:19.478
So how did you come to kill Anna Brown?

2105
02:55:20.521 --> 02:55:22.731
I was hired by W.K. Hale.

2106
02:55:22.814 --> 02:55:24.107
And what did he say to you?

2107
02:55:24.191 --> 02:55:28.403
I was to get a thousand dollars,
plus the money I owed him, which was $600.

2108
02:55:28.987 --> 02:55:33.033
-So you say you killed Anna Brown?
-Yes, sir.

2109
02:55:33.116 --> 02:55:35.077
You took her down into that canyon there

2110
02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:38.705
into what was commonly known
as the Three Mile Canyon, didn't you?

2111
02:55:38.789 --> 02:55:40.374
-Yes, sir.
-What'd you shoot her with?

2112
02:55:41.124 --> 02:55:42.125
Automatic.

2113
02:55:42.209 --> 02:55:43.710
And where'd you shoot her?

2114
02:55:45.254 --> 02:55:47.756
Shot her down through the top of her head.
Guess it killed her.

2115
02:55:49.216 --> 02:55:51.134
Now, you say you were pretty drunk.

2116
02:55:51.218 --> 02:55:52.219
Yes, sir.

2117
02:55:52.302 --> 02:55:55.180
But you knew you were killing her though,
didn't you?

2118
02:55:55.264 --> 02:55:56.265
Yes, sir.

2119
02:55:56.348 --> 02:56:00.978
And how did you get her down into
that place where you killed Anna Brown?

2120
02:56:02.479 --> 02:56:04.398
Byron and I carried her down there.

2121
02:56:04.481 --> 02:56:06.900
And did you make her drunk
so you could kill her?

2122
02:56:07.484 --> 02:56:10.112
-Yes, sir.
-Was she laying down while you killed her?

2123
02:56:10.863 --> 02:56:12.030
No, sir.

2124
02:56:12.155 --> 02:56:13.782
Well, what position was she in?

2125
02:56:15.033 --> 02:56:16.076
Sitting up.

2126
02:56:17.119 --> 02:56:22.249
Byron raised her up, pulled her up,
kind of held her up.

2127
02:56:22.332 --> 02:56:24.376
So you stood there and directed him

2128
02:56:24.459 --> 02:56:27.129
how to hold this drunken,
helpless Indian woman

2129
02:56:27.212 --> 02:56:29.006
down there at the bottom of that canyon

2130
02:56:29.089 --> 02:56:31.884
while you got ready to shoot a bullet
into her brain?

2131
02:56:31.967 --> 02:56:34.219
-Yes, sir.
-Then what happened after that?

2132
02:56:36.638 --> 02:56:38.348
Turned her loose so she fell back down.

2133
02:56:38.432 --> 02:56:39.850
Did she make an outcry?

2134
02:56:40.517 --> 02:56:41.685
No, sir.

2135
02:56:41.768 --> 02:56:44.396
And did you stand there and watch her die?

2136
02:56:45.230 --> 02:56:48.025
-No, sir.
-You were satisfied with your work?

2137
02:56:48.108 --> 02:56:51.153
-Yes, sir.
-And you just turned and left?

2138
02:56:51.987 --> 02:56:53.071
Yes, sir.

2139
02:56:53.906 --> 02:56:57.492
Have you seen that canyon
where you killed Anna Brown?

2140
02:56:58.619 --> 02:57:00.621
I've seen it a hundred times, I suppose.

2141
02:57:00.704 --> 02:57:01.705
A hundred times since.

2142
02:57:01.788 --> 02:57:04.458
You wanted to go back there
and see where you killed Anna Brown?

2143
02:57:04.541 --> 02:57:05.542
No, sir.

2144
02:57:05.626 --> 02:57:07.044
No?

2145
02:57:08.086 --> 02:57:09.087
No, sir.

2146
02:57:09.171 --> 02:57:11.173
Well, what did you wanna
go back there for?

2147
02:57:17.262 --> 02:57:18.555
It's okay.

2148
02:57:19.556 --> 02:57:21.016
You can tell the jury.

2149
02:57:24.061 --> 02:57:25.062
Well, it's a good--

2150
02:57:26.355 --> 02:57:28.815
It's a good place to park and drink,
put on parties.

2151
02:57:28.899 --> 02:57:31.109
It can't be seen from the road, so...

2152
02:57:34.446 --> 02:57:37.032
Where'd you go
after you killed Anna Brown?

2153
02:57:38.075 --> 02:57:39.952
Went to sleep at Bill Hale's.

2154
02:57:40.035 --> 02:57:41.245
What'd you do then?

2155
02:57:41.912 --> 02:57:43.413
We stayed drunk.

2156
02:57:43.497 --> 02:57:44.915
Where did Byron go?

2157
02:57:46.416 --> 02:57:47.751
Back home to Mollie's.

2158
02:58:00.097 --> 02:58:01.181
Thanks, Mollie.

2159
02:58:02.391 --> 02:58:03.475
You're welcome.

2160
02:58:16.363 --> 02:58:17.990
Watch your step right there.

2161
02:58:18.073 --> 02:58:20.909
Watch my step.
If you brought me out here to kill me,

2162
02:58:20.993 --> 02:58:23.078
-I'll kill you.
-No, come on with that.

2163
02:58:23.161 --> 02:58:24.997
Sit down here. You'll be more comfortable.

2164
02:58:25.956 --> 02:58:28.125
Okay, stop. Come on. Get up.

2165
02:58:28.208 --> 02:58:31.170
-Hold her up there. Sit her up straight.
-Sit her up straight now.

2166
02:58:31.712 --> 02:58:33.005
-There you go.
-Get up.

2167
02:58:33.088 --> 02:58:34.840
-Set her up straight now.
-Yeah. I got her.

2168
02:58:34.923 --> 02:58:36.758
You wanna kill me, I'll kill you.

2169
02:58:36.842 --> 02:58:38.093
There you are.

2170
02:59:18.342 --> 02:59:19.635
Ernest.

2171
02:59:20.844 --> 02:59:22.054
Wake up, Son.

2172
02:59:22.971 --> 02:59:23.972
Yeah.

2173
02:59:27.184 --> 02:59:28.352
What? What?

2174
02:59:29.561 --> 02:59:30.729
What is it?

2175
02:59:34.608 --> 02:59:36.318
Well, there's no easy way around it.

2176
02:59:38.737 --> 02:59:40.072
I'm to tell you

2177
02:59:41.156 --> 02:59:42.908
that your child has died.

2178
02:59:47.913 --> 02:59:49.540
What child? What child?

2179
02:59:49.623 --> 02:59:51.458
I don't know the name.

2180
02:59:52.209 --> 02:59:53.752
Who? Is...

2181
02:59:54.837 --> 02:59:56.755
Cowboy? Which one?

2182
02:59:57.464 --> 03:00:00.926
Is there a child
that had some lung trouble?

2183
03:00:01.468 --> 03:00:03.387
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Like the whooping cough?

2184
03:00:03.470 --> 03:00:06.598
No-- No, who told you this?

2185
03:00:06.682 --> 03:00:07.724
Who told you this?

2186
03:00:07.808 --> 03:00:11.186
It was one of our agents there in Fairfax
informed me.

2187
03:00:12.521 --> 03:00:14.231
Mollie went to see to it...

2188
03:00:15.649 --> 03:00:16.817
and take it home.

2189
03:00:21.029 --> 03:00:24.199
-There's no--
-It's Anna. It's Anna, ain't it?

2190
03:00:26.910 --> 03:00:28.495
There's no easy way around it, Son.

2191
03:00:28.579 --> 03:00:31.164
No! Goddamn!

2192
03:00:31.790 --> 03:00:34.585
They took my baby.

2193
03:00:35.669 --> 03:00:37.296
God bless you, Son. I...

2194
03:00:38.922 --> 03:00:40.174
Sorry for your loss.

2195
03:00:43.010 --> 03:00:44.178
What happened?

2196
03:00:45.262 --> 03:00:46.513
The baby died.

2197
03:00:46.597 --> 03:00:48.599
-Which one?
-Little baby.

2198
03:00:48.682 --> 03:00:49.892
The little one?

2199
03:00:51.018 --> 03:00:52.853
Oh, my son. My son...

2200
03:00:58.400 --> 03:00:59.985
Oh, my God.

2201
03:01:00.068 --> 03:01:01.320
They took...

2202
03:01:01.862 --> 03:01:03.113
No.

2203
03:01:06.783 --> 03:01:07.784
Ernest.

2204
03:01:12.122 --> 03:01:14.708
Little Anna's with the Lord now, Son.

2205
03:01:18.754 --> 03:01:19.838
Ernest.

2206
03:01:20.923 --> 03:01:24.343
Lord, have mercy on us.
Lord, have mercy on us.

2207
03:01:24.426 --> 03:01:26.595
Lord, Lord, Lord.

2208
03:03:34.765 --> 03:03:35.849
Hello, King.

2209
03:03:38.435 --> 03:03:39.853
How's everyone?

2210
03:03:42.105 --> 03:03:43.607
They're not good.

2211
03:03:44.149 --> 03:03:46.026
I know, Son. I feel it too.

2212
03:03:50.906 --> 03:03:55.536
You know I'm gonna have to take care
of the two kids and Mollie now.

2213
03:03:57.037 --> 03:03:58.205
So...

2214
03:03:59.581 --> 03:04:01.083
What are you saying?

2215
03:04:01.792 --> 03:04:03.627
You know what that means, right?

2216
03:04:04.920 --> 03:04:07.798
-Well...
-I'm gonna testify.

2217
03:04:12.094 --> 03:04:15.722
Well, that's a strong choice to make
against adversity.

2218
03:04:17.266 --> 03:04:19.017
-Well...
-You sure you wanna do that?

2219
03:04:19.643 --> 03:04:20.853
Yeah.

2220
03:04:22.229 --> 03:04:24.356
I have to, so...

2221
03:04:24.940 --> 03:04:26.525
They gave you a deal?

2222
03:04:27.568 --> 03:04:29.278
They gave me a deal. Yes, they did.

2223
03:04:30.153 --> 03:04:31.780
They won't hold to it.

2224
03:04:32.406 --> 03:04:35.576
Yeah, well, it's the federal government,
and that's what they told me.

2225
03:04:35.659 --> 03:04:38.704
It's the federal government.
That's why I say that.

2226
03:04:40.789 --> 03:04:44.168
All this is not gonna mean anything
except the family's gonna be broke up.

2227
03:04:44.251 --> 03:04:45.502
Is that what you want?

2228
03:04:46.545 --> 03:04:47.963
It's not gonna make a difference.

2229
03:04:48.046 --> 03:04:50.549
I tell you this
from the deepest part of my heart.

2230
03:04:50.632 --> 03:04:53.677
The deepest thing that I ever know
in my life, my experience,

2231
03:04:53.760 --> 03:04:55.971
is that this will not make a difference.

2232
03:04:58.432 --> 03:05:01.435
You know things are different now, right?
You know that?

2233
03:05:01.518 --> 03:05:05.355
The Osage, they ain't gonna stand by you.
No one's gonna stand by you no more.

2234
03:05:05.439 --> 03:05:08.025
-Osage? They love me.
-No, they're not gonna listen.

2235
03:05:08.108 --> 03:05:11.403
No. They know.
They know who gave them the streets,

2236
03:05:11.486 --> 03:05:14.948
who gave them the hospitals,
who gave them the schools. They know.

2237
03:05:15.032 --> 03:05:17.618
I've brought them
into the great 20th century.

2238
03:05:20.495 --> 03:05:21.997
They're not gonna stand by you, Bill.

2239
03:05:22.581 --> 03:05:23.790
-Oh, yeah. No?
-No.

2240
03:05:23.874 --> 03:05:25.751
They're not gonna stand by you, Bill.
It's over.

2241
03:05:25.834 --> 03:05:29.963
I mean, there might be a public outcry
for a while.

2242
03:05:30.047 --> 03:05:32.633
But then you know what happens?
People forget.

2243
03:05:32.716 --> 03:05:34.843
They don't remember. They don't care.

2244
03:05:34.927 --> 03:05:36.345
They just don't care.

2245
03:05:37.387 --> 03:05:40.307
It's just gonna be another
everyday, common tragedy.

2246
03:05:40.390 --> 03:05:43.477
Yeah, it's not common.

2247
03:05:46.980 --> 03:05:50.234
Don't do something you're gonna regret
for the rest of your life.

2248
03:05:52.236 --> 03:05:55.614
-You're gonna regret...
-I ain't got nothing but regret, Bill.

2249
03:05:56.907 --> 03:05:58.325
You have a family.

2250
03:06:00.118 --> 03:06:03.038
Children. You lost one already.
Don't make it more of a tragedy--

2251
03:06:03.121 --> 03:06:05.332
It's already a goddamn tragedy.

2252
03:06:07.167 --> 03:06:08.877
I don't want you near my family.

2253
03:06:10.712 --> 03:06:11.880
Not no more.

2254
03:06:14.174 --> 03:06:16.093
-Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
-Yeah.

2255
03:06:16.176 --> 03:06:19.263
-It's over now.
-Please, don't throw it all away.

2256
03:06:19.346 --> 03:06:23.141
-No, I can't. I can't. No, I can't.
-I'm sorry to hear that. I love you, Son.

2257
03:06:24.434 --> 03:06:25.978
I can't, Bill. Can't.

2258
03:06:30.065 --> 03:06:31.400
Don't throw it away, Son.

2259
03:06:35.779 --> 03:06:38.574
Mr. Burkhart,
you're here of your own accord?

2260
03:06:40.200 --> 03:06:41.201
Yes, sir.

2261
03:06:41.285 --> 03:06:42.953
No one has promised you anything?

2262
03:06:44.580 --> 03:06:45.873
No. No, sir.

2263
03:06:46.915 --> 03:06:51.879
Did you seek out John Ramsey
at your uncle's behest to kill Henry Roan?

2264
03:06:56.091 --> 03:06:57.134
Yes, sir.

2265
03:06:57.217 --> 03:06:59.887
Did you drive from Fairfax to Ripley

2266
03:06:59.970 --> 03:07:04.349
to tell John Ramsey
to tell Asa Kirby to do a job?

2267
03:07:08.437 --> 03:07:10.772
-Yes, sir.
-And who asked you to do all this?

2268
03:07:12.274 --> 03:07:15.152
My uncle, William Hale.

2269
03:07:15.235 --> 03:07:16.320
Can you see him?

2270
03:07:17.821 --> 03:07:18.864
Yes, sir.

2271
03:07:18.947 --> 03:07:20.574
Would you point to him, please?

2272
03:07:21.658 --> 03:07:25.078
Yes, sir. He's right there.

2273
03:07:26.663 --> 03:07:31.835
Let the record reflect the witness has
identified the defendant, William Hale.

2274
03:07:38.175 --> 03:07:42.596
And what was the job
that your uncle wanted Asa Kirby to do?

2275
03:07:45.057 --> 03:07:49.269
To blow up Reta and Bill Smith.

2276
03:07:50.020 --> 03:07:51.855
Why would he want them blown up?

2277
03:07:54.191 --> 03:07:55.609
So to get their money.

2278
03:07:57.319 --> 03:07:58.654
Are you a married man?

2279
03:08:00.781 --> 03:08:02.616
-Yes, sir.
-What's your wife's name?

2280
03:08:05.786 --> 03:08:07.079
Mollie Burkhart.

2281
03:08:07.871 --> 03:08:09.289
She's Reta's sister?

2282
03:08:10.123 --> 03:08:11.124
Yes, sir.

2283
03:08:11.208 --> 03:08:13.961
She's also the sister of Anna Brown,
who was murdered?

2284
03:08:18.215 --> 03:08:19.258
Yes.

2285
03:08:20.133 --> 03:08:22.636
And her mother is Lizzie Q., who is dead?

2286
03:08:25.514 --> 03:08:28.517
-Yes.
-And her sister Minnie is also dead?

2287
03:08:32.062 --> 03:08:33.313
Yes.

2288
03:08:33.397 --> 03:08:38.402
And all these dead women are Indian women,
are they?

2289
03:08:41.446 --> 03:08:42.531
Yes, sir.

2290
03:08:45.534 --> 03:08:48.745
If Mollie, your wife, died,

2291
03:08:50.163 --> 03:08:51.874
who would get her oil money?

2292
03:08:54.501 --> 03:08:57.337
Me and our children.

2293
03:09:00.132 --> 03:09:02.759
Did your uncle present you with a plan

2294
03:09:03.760 --> 03:09:08.098
by which you would benefit
from the deaths of all these Indian women?

2295
03:09:13.353 --> 03:09:14.396
Yes, sir.

2296
03:09:14.938 --> 03:09:18.567
And you helped your uncle
on your own making?

2297
03:09:21.278 --> 03:09:22.279
Yes.

2298
03:09:25.032 --> 03:09:28.994
And was part of this plan
that you would meet and marry Mollie Kyle

2299
03:09:29.077 --> 03:09:33.415
and kill her family and her
for their Indian oil money?

2300
03:09:36.919 --> 03:09:38.128
No, sir.

2301
03:09:41.215 --> 03:09:46.929
I met and married my wife
because I picked her up in my cab.

2302
03:09:48.096 --> 03:09:50.724
You didn't marry her
because your uncle directed you to?

2303
03:09:52.726 --> 03:09:53.727
No, sir.

2304
03:09:57.731 --> 03:09:59.691
I loved my wife from...

2305
03:10:01.276 --> 03:10:05.739
because that's what happened to us
when I picked her up in my cab.

2306
03:10:54.705 --> 03:10:56.540
How's my Cowboy?

2307
03:10:59.459 --> 03:11:00.460
Well.

2308
03:11:07.176 --> 03:11:08.802
He miss his pops?

2309
03:11:10.304 --> 03:11:11.305
Yes.

2310
03:11:13.098 --> 03:11:14.516
Elizabeth too.

2311
03:11:20.981 --> 03:11:24.985
They know what's happened?

2312
03:11:27.321 --> 03:11:28.739
Not so much.

2313
03:11:41.168 --> 03:11:43.253
Have you told all the truths?

2314
03:11:45.547 --> 03:11:46.798
Yes, I have.

2315
03:11:50.427 --> 03:11:52.554
My soul is clean now, Mollie.

2316
03:11:54.139 --> 03:11:58.310
It's a relief to me
to be out from under all this.

2317
03:12:02.022 --> 03:12:05.859
I wasn't gonna let him
get anywhere near you and the children.

2318
03:12:14.535 --> 03:12:16.161
What did you give me?

2319
03:12:20.958 --> 03:12:22.084
What?

2320
03:12:25.003 --> 03:12:26.630
What was in the shots?

2321
03:12:35.514 --> 03:12:37.724
My medicine you gave me.

2322
03:12:41.603 --> 03:12:44.022
What was in it, Sho-mee-kah-see?

2323
03:13:00.414 --> 03:13:01.582
Insulin.

2324
03:13:32.404 --> 03:13:34.156
Right had won.

2325
03:13:44.333 --> 03:13:46.585
True Crime Stories has been brought to you

2326
03:13:46.668 --> 03:13:50.964
through the courtesy of J. Edgar Hoover
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

2327
03:13:51.757 --> 03:13:56.220
This brings to a close the authenticated
story of the Osage Indian murders.

2328
03:13:56.303 --> 03:14:00.098
As we take our leave from Osage County,
we conclude.

2329
03:14:00.182 --> 03:14:04.228
The doctors, the Shoun brothers,
were never pursued by the legal system

2330
03:14:04.311 --> 03:14:06.563
for having certainly helped poison Mollie.

2331
03:14:07.439 --> 03:14:11.944
Ernest's brother, Byron Burkhart, was
tried as an accomplice to Anna's murder.

2332
03:14:12.027 --> 03:14:14.404
Kelsie Morrison said at his trial...

2333
03:14:14.488 --> 03:14:17.908
Byron got her drunk, and I did the rest.

2334
03:14:19.910 --> 03:14:22.204
Byron was released after a hung jury.

2335
03:14:22.287 --> 03:14:25.666
William Hale,
the ringleader of the deadly plots,

2336
03:14:25.749 --> 03:14:28.961
was found guilty
and sent to Leavenworth for life.

2337
03:14:31.004 --> 03:14:33.882
He would write letters back home
to his Osage friends.

2338
03:14:34.800 --> 03:14:36.927
"Dear friends, how are you all?

2339
03:14:37.010 --> 03:14:40.764
I never had better friends in my life
than the Osages,

2340
03:14:40.848 --> 03:14:43.684
and I was a true friend to them.

2341
03:14:44.852 --> 03:14:47.729
I'd rather live at Gray Horse
than any place on earth.

2342
03:14:48.564 --> 03:14:51.400
I will be back with you before many moons.

2343
03:14:52.192 --> 03:14:55.070
How is my friend Dah-kah-hee-ke?

2344
03:14:55.153 --> 03:15:00.075
Your true friend, W.K. Hale."

2345
03:15:00.158 --> 03:15:03.245
Hale was released in 1947.

2346
03:15:03.328 --> 03:15:07.624
The parole board cited his record
as a good prisoner for his early release,

2347
03:15:08.208 --> 03:15:09.626
but not everybody was happy.

2348
03:15:10.252 --> 03:15:14.673
This man, he is being released
because he paid off politicians

2349
03:15:14.756 --> 03:15:17.593
and nobody cares about the Osage lives.

2350
03:15:17.676 --> 03:15:20.971
Hale was not supposed
to set foot in Oklahoma again,

2351
03:15:21.054 --> 03:15:23.640
but according to relatives,
he often visited them.

2352
03:15:27.227 --> 03:15:28.979
What do you want for lunch, William?

2353
03:15:29.938 --> 03:15:34.109
If only that damn thickhead Ernest
had kept his fool trap shut,

2354
03:15:34.193 --> 03:15:35.777
we'd be in clover today.

2355
03:15:35.861 --> 03:15:39.781
William Hale died
in an Arizona nursing home.

2356
03:15:40.365 --> 03:15:41.950
He lived to 87 years.

2357
03:15:45.704 --> 03:15:48.874
Ernest Burkhart was sentenced
to life imprisonment

2358
03:15:48.957 --> 03:15:50.876
at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.

2359
03:15:52.044 --> 03:15:56.340
Aren't you the one who tried to kill
his "Injun" wife for the oil money?

2360
03:15:56.423 --> 03:15:59.301
Years later,
he was granted a pardon for his crimes

2361
03:15:59.384 --> 03:16:01.929
and, once again,
moved back to Osage County

2362
03:16:02.012 --> 03:16:06.934
where he lived out his days with Byron
in a trailer park north of the city.

2363
03:16:07.017 --> 03:16:08.352
Pass me a beer, Brother.

2364
03:16:09.603 --> 03:16:11.438
