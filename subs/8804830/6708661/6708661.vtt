2
00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:14.581
Equalizing
that reach early.

3
00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:16.790
- Mixing things up.
- Oh, she's tagged her!

4
00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:18.165
She's tagged her again!

5
00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.040
- Oh and again.
- Oh, shit.

6
00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:22.665
Katrina's in trouble.
She's in trouble, Mike.

7
00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:23.500
Big trouble.

8
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.915
Can she finish
it, right here, right now?

9
00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:27.873
Oh, she
shot her to the body!

10
00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.331
Katrina's in huge trouble, Mike.

11
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.415
Oh, my! Over and over!

12
00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:34.873
- Boom, that's it!
- Oh, my goodness!

13
00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:36.042
Oh, my goodness! What a fall
from grace!

14
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.373
Katrina the HellKat Bash,
KO'd and it's all over.

15
00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.375
Just like that.

16
00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:29.542
Heavenly.

17
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.333
Beautiful.

18
00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:25.748
Where you headed?

19
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.583
You need a lift?

20
00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:37.833
How about a smoke?

21
00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:43.540
You know, the next town's
60 miles from here.

22
00:03:43.542 --> 00:03:46.833
They got a bus station there,
and a bar.

23
00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:51.540
Hey.

24
00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:54.498
I'm just tryin' to do
a good Samaritan here.

25
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.042
I'm not planning on hurting ya.

26
00:03:57.667 --> 00:03:59.625
I'm not worried about you
hurting me.

27
00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:01.625
Then hop in.

28
00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:03.875
Or not.

29
00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:31.250
Heavenly.

30
00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:34.167
Beautiful, isn't it?

31
00:04:35.292 --> 00:04:38.333
The way everything just
disappears into the darkness.

32
00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:47.083
They say smoking's bad for you.

33
00:04:48.417 --> 00:04:49.248
But if that was true,

34
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.375
why would the good Lord
have created tobacco?

35
00:04:57.583 --> 00:05:00.458
I say indulge in his intelligent
design.

36
00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:06.456
You smoke pot?

37
00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:08.248
You smell of pot.

38
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.417
I got a nose for that.

39
00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:13.790
You like cigarettes.

40
00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:15.248
I bet you like booze.

41
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.875
Yeah, people say I got a sixth
sense.

42
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.748
You're passin' through.

43
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.583
Where you headed?

44
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.250
I'm not sure.

45
00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:26.208
Somewhere.

46
00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:29.456
You're already somewhere,
sister.

47
00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:30.623
Somewhere.

48
00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:32.290
Anywhere.

49
00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:34.831
♪ Doesn't really matter ♪

50
00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:38.040
♪ 'Cause his righteous
hands are always there ♪

51
00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:41.540
♪ To help you up the ladder ♪

52
00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:42.873
That's one of mine.

53
00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.792
I wrote a few songs, sermons and
sets.

54
00:05:45.708 --> 00:05:47.373
That's really interesting.

55
00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:50.000
Just using my talents
to further his work.

56
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.375
You ever heard of the prosperity
gospel?

57
00:05:55.792 --> 00:05:57.375
- Nope.
- Oh, sure you have.

58
00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.998
If you give a little to the
ministry,

59
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.542
you get a lot from the Lord.

60
00:06:03.375 --> 00:06:05.415
Don't ask why. It's a miracle.

61
00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:07.917
Jesus wants you to have
abundance.

62
00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:11.125
Prosperity gospel.

63
00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:13.167
That was my idea.

64
00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:15.958
They stole it from me.

65
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.042
I even designed a coin.

66
00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:21.208
Limited edition.

67
00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:24.665
On one side, you had Jesus,

68
00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:29.667
and on the other, you had
an AR-15 rifle and an eagle,

69
00:06:29.917 --> 00:06:32.292
all wrapped up in the stars and
stripes.

70
00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:36.125
That majestic bird, staring up
to heaven.

71
00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:40.333
How much do you think people
would give for that coin?

72
00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:44.583
Pass it down on their deathbed,
clutch it to their chest.

73
00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:48.331
God knows.

74
00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:49.706
Exactly.

75
00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:51.373
You got a quick wit.

76
00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:53.665
Can I get an Amen?

77
00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:56.498
I'll pass.

78
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.708
Am I annoying you yet?

79
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.792
Now where did you get that scar?

80
00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:06.081
What scar?

81
00:07:06.083 --> 00:07:08.833
Oh, the one between
the wings on your neck.

82
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.625
Did I touch a nerve, sister?

83
00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:55.292
Thanks for the ride.

84
00:07:58.167 --> 00:08:00.000
Now hold on a second,
sister.

85
00:08:02.542 --> 00:08:03.500
Unlock the door.

86
00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:06.875
But wouldn't you like
a smoke for the road?

87
00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:10.456
Unlock the door.

88
00:08:12.042 --> 00:08:15.373
But I've been looking for
you everywhere, Katrina Bash.

89
00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:17.583
And hallelujah, I've found you.

90
00:08:24.458 --> 00:08:25.458
Oh, you like guns?

91
00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:19.958
Destination?

92
00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:27.083
Where can I get to for 80
bucks?

93
00:10:28.208 --> 00:10:29.958
A lot of places better than
here.

94
00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:37.125
When you know where you're
going, I'm right here.

95
00:10:39.042 --> 00:10:40.081
Mine it is.

96
00:10:40.083 --> 00:10:41.833
A rather good choice.

97
00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:43.958
Ladies night!

98
00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:02.248
Fuck everyone else.

99
00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.167
You know, non-alcohol beer...

100
00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:44.500
Is worse for you than alcoholic
beer.

101
00:11:45.667 --> 00:11:47.250
It's full of additives and shit.

102
00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:49.542
It's like cancer in a glass.

103
00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:02.831
What can I get ya?

104
00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:03.708
Water.

105
00:12:19.083 --> 00:12:19.915
You're in luck.

106
00:12:19.917 --> 00:12:21.750
No charge for water on ladies
night.

107
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.583
I'd prefer tequila.

108
00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:28.542
Except, I don't have any money.

109
00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.667
Just another no-good drifter!

110
00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:39.125
I'd buy you a drink, but I
don't need a handjob tonight.

111
00:12:40.917 --> 00:12:43.831
Besides, you stink.

112
00:12:43.833 --> 00:12:46.417
You smell like an ashtray
in a kitty litter box.

113
00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:08.042
Fuck sake, man.

114
00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:20.958
How do you feel about vomit?

115
00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:24.208
And urine.

116
00:13:25.417 --> 00:13:27.125
Bodily fluids in general.

117
00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:29.583
I'll stick with water.

118
00:13:30.917 --> 00:13:31.831
You clean that up,

119
00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:34.831
and I'll fill your glass
to the brim with tequila.

120
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:37.375
And I'll keep it coming. You
drink as much as you want.

121
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.958
And you can stay the night
in the drunk tank out back.

122
00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.623
Oh, drunk tank.

123
00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:47.998
Sounds heavenly.

124
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.792
Well, it's more of a shed,
really.

125
00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:52.665
Little service we offer
for those who wanna

126
00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:54.417
get away from the wife for a
while.

127
00:13:56.042 --> 00:13:57.083
It's vacant tonight.

128
00:13:58.667 --> 00:14:00.167
Unless you're too good for it?

129
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.625
I'm not too good for anything.

130
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.583
Throw in two packs.

131
00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:15.998
I tell ya.

132
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.208
Cans are usually more disgusting
tonight.

133
00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:27.250
Deal's a deal.

134
00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.458
Ain't exactly 100% Agave.

135
00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.417
More like squeezed out
demapo from Tijuana.

136
00:14:58.375 --> 00:14:59.875
As long it helps me forget.

137
00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:02.208
Another one, please.

138
00:18:13.458 --> 00:18:14.375
You like boxing?

139
00:18:20.417 --> 00:18:23.290
Used to.

140
00:18:23.292 --> 00:18:24.540
Don't suppose you've expanded

141
00:18:24.542 --> 00:18:27.165
your tequila selection since
last night?

142
00:18:27.167 --> 00:18:28.000
Nope.

143
00:18:28.917 --> 00:18:30.042
Stayin' another night?

144
00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:32.042
Probably.

145
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.415
You gonna clean up again at
close?

146
00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:36.790
That's the plan.

147
00:18:36.792 --> 00:18:38.583
Can't get any worse than last
night.

148
00:18:53.875 --> 00:18:56.875
So, what's the next move,
drifter?

149
00:18:58.458 --> 00:19:00.748
I don't have any more moves.

150
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.333
Drink herself to death!

151
00:19:03.708 --> 00:19:04.542
That'll work.

152
00:19:08.542 --> 00:19:10.375
Barkeep, could I get an ashtray?

153
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.833
What a clueless bitch.

154
00:19:17.042 --> 00:19:18.750
You can't drink yourself to
death.

155
00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:21.123
If you're already dead.

156
00:19:24.542 --> 00:19:26.500
Oh, you must be some
brain-damaged hoe.

157
00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.873
Oh, we've all got a little hoe
in us,

158
00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:31.165
and we're all on our way to
death.

159
00:19:31.167 --> 00:19:33.042
Barkeep, can you hit me again,
please?

160
00:19:37.708 --> 00:19:39.331
Barkeep.

161
00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:41.042
How do you make a lesbian
vampire?

162
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.248
We don't do that kinda
trendy shit. You know that.

163
00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.542
Nothin' trendy about it.

164
00:19:47.417 --> 00:19:48.956
This is a timeless drink.

165
00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:50.083
Highball glass.

166
00:19:51.042 --> 00:19:53.040
Don't bother washing
it from the last drunk.

167
00:19:53.042 --> 00:19:55.123
Just wipe it with a dirty rag.

168
00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:57.540
Two shots little raw whiskey.

169
00:19:57.542 --> 00:19:59.581
Two shots Russian piss vodka.

170
00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:00.417
And the rest?

171
00:20:01.375 --> 00:20:02.625
Mad Dog, Ripple.

172
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.123
Whatever wino shit you
can get from the gutter.

173
00:20:06.125 --> 00:20:07.706
And no ice.

174
00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:08.833
That's for faggots.

175
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:13.583
Then...

176
00:20:15.458 --> 00:20:18.542
You cut some part of the body.

177
00:20:19.792 --> 00:20:20.625
Your body.

178
00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:24.748
Somebody else's body.

179
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.583
Doesn't matter.

180
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:31.750
Then you drip, drip, drip
the blood in.

181
00:20:32.375 --> 00:20:33.292
That's the cherry.

182
00:20:34.625 --> 00:20:37.917
The coup de grace, like the
frogs say.

183
00:20:39.083 --> 00:20:40.458
You forgot the umbrella.

184
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.458
What did you say?

185
00:20:45.833 --> 00:20:49.915
I said, you're a
mouth-breathing knuckle-dragger.

186
00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:51.498
- What?
- Ah!

187
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.208
And a deaf-mute, too.

188
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.290
Get outta here before you get
hurt.

189
00:20:56.292 --> 00:20:57.917
Before who gets
hurt?

190
00:20:59.792 --> 00:21:03.208
Time to go, Viper.

191
00:21:08.458 --> 00:21:12.498
There ain't no such thing
as a vampire cocktail.

192
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.833
You shut your beak,
you waste-of-life boozer.

193
00:21:15.833 --> 00:21:16.667
Worthless drunk.

194
00:21:18.542 --> 00:21:20.498
They say it's a disease!

195
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.000
You're a fuckin' disease.

196
00:21:25.583 --> 00:21:27.292
What're you gonna do about it,
bitch?

197
00:21:28.792 --> 00:21:29.917
Some vigilante shit?

198
00:21:30.792 --> 00:21:31.873
I don't think so.

199
00:21:47.833 --> 00:21:49.415
Hit the road, Viper.

200
00:21:49.417 --> 00:21:50.750
That's enough for tonight.

201
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.415
You get rid of one worthless
drunk,

202
00:21:55.417 --> 00:21:57.625
another one pops up
right back in his place.

203
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.958
Right, Cucaracha?

204
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.875
Look at me, you dumb broad!

205
00:22:04.667 --> 00:22:06.417
We're gonna match now, sister,
see.

206
00:22:12.708 --> 00:22:14.415
Like I said.

207
00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:17.456
You're already dead, HellKat.

208
00:22:17.458 --> 00:22:19.290
Started from the bottom?

209
00:22:19.292 --> 00:22:20.375
Welcome back.

210
00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:23.500
See you soon.

211
00:22:50.792 --> 00:22:51.625
Again.

212
00:23:23.375 --> 00:23:24.792
What the hell?

213
00:23:30.042 --> 00:23:31.292
Closing time, drifter.

214
00:23:33.917 --> 00:23:36.665
Okay, what is this?

215
00:23:36.667 --> 00:23:38.540
What is what?

216
00:23:38.542 --> 00:23:39.625
Two moons.

217
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.917
Maybe tequila moons.

218
00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:50.667
I think you've got something
to tell me.

219
00:23:52.333 --> 00:23:53.625
Wish I could, kitty cat.

220
00:23:55.458 --> 00:23:56.417
It's not my job.

221
00:23:57.917 --> 00:23:59.958
Okay, what is going on here?

222
00:24:00.958 --> 00:24:02.792
You all know me, I don't know
you.

223
00:24:04.833 --> 00:24:05.667
What's your name?

224
00:24:07.667 --> 00:24:08.750
I don't have a name.

225
00:24:10.208 --> 00:24:11.208
I'm just a barkeep.

226
00:24:57.792 --> 00:25:00.081
Basements don't need cleaning.

227
00:25:00.083 --> 00:25:01.375
Just the bathrooms.

228
00:25:25.792 --> 00:25:27.665
What the hell?

229
00:25:39.833 --> 00:25:41.417
You do good cleaning work.

230
00:25:42.417 --> 00:25:43.250
Right.

231
00:25:45.792 --> 00:25:47.373
Tequila?

232
00:25:48.667 --> 00:25:50.917
You sure can drink,
but last call's over.

233
00:25:52.792 --> 00:25:55.498
I'm not permitted to serve after
closing.

234
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.998
Seriously?

235
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.706
Our deal was I drink whenever I
want.

236
00:25:59.708 --> 00:26:01.706
Not after closing.

237
00:26:01.708 --> 00:26:03.331
Well, isn't this your bar?

238
00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:05.540
- No.
- Well, who owns it then?

239
00:26:05.542 --> 00:26:07.790
I do.

240
00:26:07.792 --> 00:26:10.583
I own your entire world now,
Katrina.

241
00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:17.665
Party's about to begin, HellKat.

242
00:26:17.667 --> 00:26:18.500
Are you ready?

243
00:26:37.083 --> 00:26:39.415
And in the
blue corner, the challenger.

244
00:26:39.417 --> 00:26:41.998
Fighting out of Albuquerque, New
Mexico,

245
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.998
the number one ranked women's
middleweight in the world,

246
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.500
Katrina Bash HellKat!

247
00:27:00.958 --> 00:27:03.081
Oh, look.

248
00:27:03.083 --> 00:27:04.958
How bewitching the moons are
tonight.

249
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.998
You know, you can
tell a lot about a person

250
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.417
by what's in their backpack.

251
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.290
Dope?

252
00:27:19.292 --> 00:27:20.417
Or is it catnip?

253
00:27:22.167 --> 00:27:23.000
Meow.

254
00:27:25.292 --> 00:27:27.542
Oh, look. She's a reader.

255
00:27:28.458 --> 00:27:31.373
Probably that
prosperity gospel shit.

256
00:27:31.375 --> 00:27:33.165
Look at this butch-ass wallet.

257
00:27:33.167 --> 00:27:34.208
What do we have here?

258
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.792
Broke-ass bitch.

259
00:27:45.625 --> 00:27:48.042
Look at this little faggot.

260
00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:24.375
Katrina, are you okay?

261
00:28:27.542 --> 00:28:28.958
Hello, HellKat.

262
00:28:39.458 --> 00:28:42.625
I'd offer you cigarette,
but this is my last one.

263
00:28:44.042 --> 00:28:45.083
The fuck is that?

264
00:28:47.458 --> 00:28:50.417
Evening, kids.

265
00:28:51.917 --> 00:28:52.831
What're you staring at?

266
00:28:52.833 --> 00:28:54.958
You got something on
your shirt, Dominus.

267
00:28:56.208 --> 00:28:57.042
Pocket.

268
00:29:01.667 --> 00:29:04.331
Now the party really has
started.

269
00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:07.542
We even got hors d'oeuvres.

270
00:29:15.292 --> 00:29:17.123
Mm.

271
00:29:17.125 --> 00:29:20.165
Just like an oyster,
except for the aftertaste.

272
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.792
Better than liver, though.

273
00:29:23.792 --> 00:29:27.167
My momma used to make us eat
liver every Friday night.

274
00:29:28.625 --> 00:29:31.083
'Cause that weren't meat,
see, that was an organ,

275
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.081
and I used to keep it
balled up in my cheek.

276
00:29:36.083 --> 00:29:39.417
Looked like a little chipmunk.

277
00:29:40.917 --> 00:29:43.248
And I'd run round the back of
the house,

278
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.665
and I'd spit it in the lake.

279
00:29:45.667 --> 00:29:47.333
Till one day, she caught me.

280
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.331
And then I learned to love
liver.

281
00:29:51.333 --> 00:29:55.000
I learned to love all organs.

282
00:29:56.833 --> 00:29:57.792
Let's play a game.

283
00:29:59.542 --> 00:30:02.831
It's called whoever wins the
fight,

284
00:30:02.833 --> 00:30:05.456
gets to leave the bar alive.

285
00:30:05.458 --> 00:30:09.456
It's a catchy title, isn't it?

286
00:30:09.458 --> 00:30:11.167
You ever seen one of these
before?

287
00:30:12.208 --> 00:30:14.873
Ah, it's enchanting.

288
00:30:14.875 --> 00:30:18.167
Whoever says the magic word gets
it.

289
00:30:37.833 --> 00:30:39.456
Get up, bitch.

290
00:30:39.458 --> 00:30:40.292
Hit me!

291
00:30:41.125 --> 00:30:43.081
Fucking hit me!

292
00:30:51.958 --> 00:30:56.958
Why, that's quite the
statement.

293
00:30:57.542 --> 00:30:59.915
I should kill you.

294
00:30:59.917 --> 00:31:00.792
Kill me?

295
00:31:02.042 --> 00:31:03.958
Oh, you're fuckin' high, sister.

296
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.083
And not on life.

297
00:31:07.083 --> 00:31:09.667
Let's not spend any more
valuable time together.

298
00:31:12.875 --> 00:31:14.292
Keep your distance.

299
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.042
What kind of a mother are you
anyway?

300
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:27.206
The kind who doesn't give
a shit about her own son.

301
00:31:27.208 --> 00:31:28.833
Leaves him to die.

302
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:34.708
A narcissist who put her
career in front of her family.

303
00:31:36.458 --> 00:31:40.708
If you could call that
a career, or a family.

304
00:31:41.917 --> 00:31:47.123
Just feels like a pathetic
waste of space to me.

305
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.540
You made it to the big leagues,

306
00:31:51.542 --> 00:31:54.208
but you couldn't close the deal,
could ya?

307
00:31:55.542 --> 00:31:59.540
And what a heavy price
you paid for failure.

308
00:32:01.833 --> 00:32:03.042
I can't remember.

309
00:32:04.292 --> 00:32:09.250
Have I complemented you on
your neck tattoo?

310
00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:41.956
Do you need a hug?

311
00:32:47.792 --> 00:32:48.625
Atonement.

312
00:32:49.833 --> 00:32:52.125
Oh, how sweet the sound.

313
00:32:53.042 --> 00:32:55.792
"If I could just have another
chance!"

314
00:33:01.542 --> 00:33:05.915
Well, here you are.

315
00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:07.083
Look familiar?

316
00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:11.792
You have no idea.

317
00:33:13.167 --> 00:33:16.248
Keep watchin'.

318
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.831
It's better if you get it in
the full-screen experience.

319
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.833
You gettin' it now?

320
00:34:37.792 --> 00:34:40.542
You might need one of these
when you hear the next bit.

321
00:34:49.833 --> 00:34:51.623
I quit.

322
00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:52.790
Oh.

323
00:34:52.792 --> 00:34:54.167
Congratulations.

324
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.292
Too bad you didn't do it
earlier, though.

325
00:34:58.292 --> 00:35:00.875
'Cause you left one
smoldering in the ashtray.

326
00:35:02.458 --> 00:35:04.000
Burned the whole motel down.

327
00:35:05.417 --> 00:35:07.125
Killed an entire family.

328
00:35:08.042 --> 00:35:09.248
Mommy.

329
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.706
Daddy.

330
00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:12.456
Baby girl.

331
00:35:12.458 --> 00:35:14.165
A little kiddie, too.

332
00:35:15.583 --> 00:35:17.000
Oh, the irony.

333
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.665
See, you can't help it, Katrina.

334
00:35:20.667 --> 00:35:24.042
You destroy everything you
touch.

335
00:35:25.625 --> 00:35:27.706
They were just poor white trash
anyway,

336
00:35:27.708 --> 00:35:31.331
so nobody gave a shit.

337
00:35:31.333 --> 00:35:33.000
Back to more important things.

338
00:35:34.167 --> 00:35:36.956
Like what the hell is going on
here.

339
00:35:36.958 --> 00:35:39.373
Just hold your horses, little
lady.

340
00:35:39.375 --> 00:35:43.375
All I need from you is
a digital signature,

341
00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:47.167
and I'll let the cat out of the
bag.

342
00:35:48.125 --> 00:35:51.333
If we can find the will.

343
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:56.542
What can I do?

344
00:35:59.042 --> 00:36:01.542
The boy gets another
spin at the vida loca.

345
00:36:02.625 --> 00:36:06.125
All you have to do is put on a
good show.

346
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.331
Self-correction.

347
00:36:14.333 --> 00:36:16.292
You gotta win the tournament.

348
00:36:17.583 --> 00:36:20.542
Old-school, O.G. UFC one.

349
00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.248
But I know you can do it,
HellKat.

350
00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:25.292
I'm a believer.

351
00:36:26.208 --> 00:36:29.917
There's a special place inside
me reserved for dark horses.

352
00:36:31.125 --> 00:36:32.625
I'll be looking out for you.

353
00:36:34.833 --> 00:36:39.456
So just stare your eyeball real
close into the screen there.

354
00:36:39.458 --> 00:36:41.290
Retina scan.

355
00:36:41.292 --> 00:36:43.917
State your full name, loud and
clear,

356
00:36:44.958 --> 00:36:46.458
and we'll call that a deal.

357
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.333
Katrina Bash.

358
00:36:55.458 --> 00:36:56.917
Katrina Bashinski.

359
00:37:05.917 --> 00:37:09.958
Doesn't quite roll off the
tongue, does it?

360
00:40:40.792 --> 00:40:41.625
HellKat.

361
00:40:45.167 --> 00:40:46.000
HellKat!

362
00:40:48.792 --> 00:40:52.625
The proud are laid low
and the humble exalted!

363
00:41:10.292 --> 00:41:12.042
You're a bloody mess!

364
00:41:14.583 --> 00:41:15.915
Don't move!

365
00:41:15.917 --> 00:41:17.498
Almost done!

366
00:41:20.708 --> 00:41:23.331
- What the hell?
- Indeed!

367
00:41:35.167 --> 00:41:37.415
You won't feel a thing.

368
00:41:38.917 --> 00:41:42.248
Just kidding of course.

369
00:41:46.083 --> 00:41:48.917
Fixing you up for your next
fight!

370
00:41:56.208 --> 00:41:57.792
You can get up now.

371
00:42:10.625 --> 00:42:11.458
Gratitude?

372
00:42:13.542 --> 00:42:14.748
What about it?

373
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.042
You should try it!

374
00:42:19.875 --> 00:42:21.415
You know where you are?

375
00:42:21.417 --> 00:42:23.331
She has no idea.

376
00:42:23.333 --> 00:42:25.375
I believe she does.

377
00:42:27.542 --> 00:42:28.458
I've gone crazy?

378
00:42:30.625 --> 00:42:31.458
Not yet.

379
00:42:33.583 --> 00:42:34.748
I'm in hell?

380
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:35.792
Not quite.

381
00:42:37.458 --> 00:42:38.417
I'm starving?

382
00:42:39.542 --> 00:42:41.415
We have an infinite supply.

383
00:42:41.417 --> 00:42:43.623
Chips and jerky.

384
00:42:43.625 --> 00:42:45.583
What more could you want in
life?

385
00:42:52.375 --> 00:42:53.208
Fish!

386
00:42:57.792 --> 00:42:58.958
Are you ready?

387
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.956
Are you gonna piss your pants?

388
00:43:09.583 --> 00:43:11.165
Oh.

389
00:43:11.167 --> 00:43:12.667
What a cliche.

390
00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:17.665
Glad I didn't ask if you
were shittin' yourself.

391
00:43:21.542 --> 00:43:25.083
You signed up for this, so
let's not make a biggie of it.

392
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:28.792
- Who am I fighting?
- You mean what.

393
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:32.956
- What?
- Yeah.

394
00:43:32.958 --> 00:43:34.667
What are you fightin'.

395
00:43:36.458 --> 00:43:38.792
A most charming critter, indeed.

396
00:43:40.292 --> 00:43:45.292
Because today's the day the
teddy bears have their picnic.

397
00:46:12.417 --> 00:46:13.250
No!

398
00:46:31.458 --> 00:46:33.748
What the fuck?

399
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:34.583
What happened?

400
00:46:36.792 --> 00:46:39.915
Somebody won, somebody lost.

401
00:46:39.917 --> 00:46:42.248
What happens to somebody who
lost?

402
00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:43.540
That depends.

403
00:46:43.542 --> 00:46:48.206
If somebody is of the
nether, they cease to exist.

404
00:46:48.208 --> 00:46:51.081
If somebody is human,
they become of the nether.

405
00:46:51.083 --> 00:46:53.373
They become a fucking monster?

406
00:46:53.375 --> 00:46:55.498
Not that they are aware of.

407
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.956
Oh, what a relief.

408
00:46:56.958 --> 00:46:59.206
You are here of your own
doings.

409
00:46:59.208 --> 00:47:02.623
Your actions brought you here.

410
00:47:02.625 --> 00:47:05.206
Be grateful you have one last
chance.

411
00:47:05.208 --> 00:47:08.458
And be thankful I'm here to help
you.

412
00:47:11.333 --> 00:47:12.750
Better warm up.

413
00:47:16.208 --> 00:47:17.667
By hitting that meat bag?

414
00:47:18.625 --> 00:47:21.500
How do you prepare for a
giant mother nether fuck?

415
00:47:22.625 --> 00:47:23.458
Lubricate.

416
00:47:24.625 --> 00:47:28.540
Try fuckin' this.

417
00:47:31.792 --> 00:47:33.250
Save your energy, sister.

418
00:47:34.667 --> 00:47:38.375
You're gonna need it and you're
beginning to piss me off.

419
00:47:43.167 --> 00:47:44.375
You're up in five.

420
00:47:45.792 --> 00:47:46.625
Lubricate.

421
00:47:54.125 --> 00:47:55.540
This is it.

422
00:47:55.542 --> 00:47:56.831
Fuck me.

423
00:47:56.833 --> 00:47:58.456
I'm done.

424
00:47:58.458 --> 00:47:59.998
You can do
this.

425
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.206
No.

426
00:48:01.208 --> 00:48:02.456
It's over.

427
00:48:02.458 --> 00:48:03.625
I'm over.

428
00:48:04.583 --> 00:48:05.792
HellKat won her fight.

429
00:48:06.792 --> 00:48:08.790
If she can, you can win.

430
00:48:08.792 --> 00:48:10.290
We can win.

431
00:48:10.292 --> 00:48:11.915
This little shit won?

432
00:48:11.917 --> 00:48:12.915
How?

433
00:48:12.917 --> 00:48:16.873
All you think you know means
nothing.

434
00:48:16.875 --> 00:48:20.706
Ignore your mind, embrace your
spirit.

435
00:48:20.708 --> 00:48:21.873
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

436
00:48:21.875 --> 00:48:24.623
Everything that really
matters is right here.

437
00:48:24.625 --> 00:48:26.915
That's your heart!

438
00:48:26.917 --> 00:48:28.831
I said your spirit!

439
00:48:28.833 --> 00:48:30.706
What difference does it make?

440
00:48:30.708 --> 00:48:32.748
I'm fucked either way.

441
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:35.208
Why the fuck do you think
I'm here to start with?

442
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:38.375
What did you do to get put here?

443
00:48:40.958 --> 00:48:42.208
Do you know why I'm here?

444
00:48:43.792 --> 00:48:45.290
I don't need to know.

445
00:48:45.292 --> 00:48:47.750
You don't want to know.
Believe me.

446
00:48:49.333 --> 00:48:50.958
I am not fit to judge.

447
00:48:54.917 --> 00:48:56.415
And the only way I can save
myself

448
00:48:56.417 --> 00:48:58.706
is by fighting a fucking
monster?

449
00:48:58.708 --> 00:49:00.540
Everyone has their own path.

450
00:49:00.542 --> 00:49:02.623
Oh, spare the Buddha
bullshit. I'm fucked.

451
00:49:02.625 --> 00:49:04.040
- So we've heard!
- Fuck you!

452
00:49:04.042 --> 00:49:05.248
Calm down, Salt.

453
00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:06.540
You calm down!

454
00:49:06.542 --> 00:49:08.206
Shit!

455
00:49:08.208 --> 00:49:10.083
What are they gonna put in front
of me?

456
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.165
What if it's something
I'm really scared of?

457
00:49:13.167 --> 00:49:14.665
They know everything about us.

458
00:49:14.667 --> 00:49:16.665
Our, our pasts, our nightmares.

459
00:49:16.667 --> 00:49:18.456
Okay look, just stop it, okay?

460
00:49:18.458 --> 00:49:19.956
Fuck off!

461
00:49:19.958 --> 00:49:21.373
Oh, my god.

462
00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:22.542
Not here.

463
00:49:24.208 --> 00:49:25.540
Why?

464
00:49:25.542 --> 00:49:26.540
Why?

465
00:49:26.542 --> 00:49:29.081
We all know why we're here.

466
00:49:29.083 --> 00:49:30.956
We've earned it!

467
00:49:30.958 --> 00:49:35.040
Now face it and do what you do
need to do.

468
00:49:35.042 --> 00:49:38.998
This is truly your last chance.

469
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.081
Fuck!

470
00:49:40.083 --> 00:49:40.917
Jesus.

471
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.415
Did somebody say "fuck Jesus?"

472
00:49:46.875 --> 00:49:49.331
Can I get an Amen?

473
00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:56.208
Can you hear that?

474
00:49:58.833 --> 00:49:59.958
What are they saying?

475
00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:03.625
"Kill the bitch."

476
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:05.833
Let's go.

477
00:50:07.083 --> 00:50:08.915
I didn't know what I was
doing.

478
00:50:08.917 --> 00:50:11.373
It wasn't my fault. I was sick.

479
00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:12.581
What do they call it?

480
00:50:12.583 --> 00:50:14.000
Not guilty due to insanity.

481
00:50:15.458 --> 00:50:16.500
I don't deserve this.

482
00:50:19.167 --> 00:50:20.167
Yes, you do.

483
00:50:56.708 --> 00:50:57.542
Oh, no.

484
00:51:02.083 --> 00:51:04.831
You get your fuckin' ass in
there,

485
00:51:04.833 --> 00:51:07.042
or I'll send you straight to
hell.

486
00:51:08.667 --> 00:51:09.458
Get up.

487
00:51:32.542 --> 00:51:34.998
I'm sorry.

488
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.998
I'm sorry for what I did.

489
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.748
Oh, okay.

490
00:51:41.333 --> 00:51:45.250
All is forgiven then.

491
00:52:53.042 --> 00:52:54.206
Yes!

492
00:52:54.208 --> 00:52:55.123
Fuck yes!

493
00:52:55.125 --> 00:52:57.917
Now let me go. I want my reward,
you fuck.

494
00:52:59.667 --> 00:53:01.540
Here she is.

495
00:53:01.542 --> 00:53:02.706
Don't you look divine?

496
00:53:02.708 --> 00:53:05.165
Mm, Jimmy.

497
00:53:05.167 --> 00:53:06.292
Are you singing?

498
00:53:07.958 --> 00:53:10.373
Not yet.

499
00:53:18.875 --> 00:53:20.208
What the fuck?

500
00:53:48.167 --> 00:53:49.083
Oh, fuck.

501
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.873
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose,
man.

502
00:54:00.208 --> 00:54:01.040
Ain't no way.

503
00:54:08.083 --> 00:54:09.083
Fuck this.

504
00:54:10.042 --> 00:54:15.165
There is eternity, there is
oblivion and there is hope.

505
00:54:15.167 --> 00:54:20.083
Where you end up, believe it
or not, is entirely up to you.

506
00:54:27.958 --> 00:54:30.292
Let's get ready to rumble!

507
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:39.542
Whatever you are, I don't
care.

508
00:54:47.958 --> 00:54:51.333
You're really beginning
to piss me off, sister.

509
00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.000
You're up, big boy.

510
00:55:39.875 --> 00:55:41.831
Listen, before you go in,

511
00:55:41.833 --> 00:55:45.248
is there any way you could
lay down on this one?

512
00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:47.415
Because if you lose, we could do
a whole

513
00:55:47.417 --> 00:55:50.498
cat versus dog thing in the next
round.

514
00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.831
That's clever, right?

515
00:56:01.042 --> 00:56:04.081
Jimmy.

516
00:56:35.708 --> 00:56:37.373
Come on, big boy.

517
00:56:37.375 --> 00:56:38.623
Hit him!

518
00:56:38.625 --> 00:56:43.250
Hit him!

519
00:57:17.417 --> 00:57:20.083
Jimmy!

520
00:57:28.167 --> 00:57:29.000
Jimmy!

521
00:58:33.667 --> 00:58:38.748
Oh, fuck.

522
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:40.581
He'll be fine.

523
00:58:40.583 --> 00:58:41.998
Get ready for the...

524
00:58:49.708 --> 00:58:51.998
Congratulations,
big boy.

525
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.833
You beat the tomato can,
and with such style, too.

526
00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.250
You're up next, kit cat.

527
00:59:18.167 --> 00:59:19.875
Oh, do you like my boots?

528
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.333
I'm flattered you noticed.

529
00:59:23.917 --> 00:59:25.540
They're very rare.

530
00:59:25.542 --> 00:59:28.623
Made of 100% human skin.

531
00:59:28.625 --> 00:59:31.248
Just the uppers, of course.

532
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:33.292
They'd make a great present for
somebody.

533
00:59:34.292 --> 00:59:38.333
Unless you'd like a pair
for yourself.

534
01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:10.790
Holy Moses.

535
01:02:12.167 --> 01:02:13.415
I gotta tell ya.

536
01:02:13.417 --> 01:02:15.915
I can't wait for this next
fight.

537
01:02:15.917 --> 01:02:18.873
The crowd is so quiet with
anticipation down there,

538
01:02:18.875 --> 01:02:21.915
you could hear a rat piss in
Hong Kong.

539
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.208
Are you ready?

540
01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:26.748
No.

541
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:27.833
Well, get ready.

542
01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:31.040
One night only.

543
01:02:31.042 --> 01:02:33.123
Last man standing.

544
01:02:33.125 --> 01:02:35.290
John Hancock on the jotted line.

545
01:02:35.292 --> 01:02:36.790
Son of a bitch.

546
01:02:36.792 --> 01:02:38.248
Indeed.

547
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:40.373
She was a bitch.

548
01:02:40.375 --> 01:02:43.998
Her specialty was drinking
and then she'd hit me

549
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.208
with whatever she could get her
hands on.

550
01:02:47.292 --> 01:02:49.917
Took till the time came
for me to hit her back.

551
01:02:51.083 --> 01:02:53.375
And there began the yellow brick
road.

552
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.417
And look at me now.

553
01:02:57.125 --> 01:02:58.331
I'm the wizard.

554
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:02.583
Here we go, big boy.

555
01:03:04.458 --> 01:03:05.417
Gotta tell ya.

556
01:03:06.458 --> 01:03:08.167
I don't fancy your chances.

557
01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:18.873
No one saves us, but
ourselves.

558
01:03:18.875 --> 01:03:21.373
- What about God?
- God?

559
01:03:21.375 --> 01:03:23.581
God grants you free will!

560
01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:27.206
Your own mind, your own spirit,
yourself.

561
01:03:27.208 --> 01:03:30.665
Your being alone has the
power to enlighten you.

562
01:03:30.667 --> 01:03:34.125
Just as it may destroy you.

563
01:03:43.083 --> 01:03:43.917
What?

564
01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:46.706
What's that?

565
01:03:46.708 --> 01:03:48.581
Liquid God.

566
01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:49.417
Come here!

567
01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.915
Turn around!

568
01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:54.750
Trust me.

569
01:03:55.833 --> 01:03:57.581
This will help.

570
01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:04.540
Damn.

571
01:04:04.542 --> 01:04:06.540
That feels good.

572
01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:11.458
No matter what awaits you
below, believe you can prevail.

573
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:24.583
Damn.

574
01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:28.540
Show time.

575
01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:03.790
Come!

576
01:06:03.792 --> 01:06:05.331
Let me work on you!

577
01:06:05.333 --> 01:06:06.167
No.

578
01:06:07.375 --> 01:06:08.750
- Come!
- I said, no!

579
01:06:10.125 --> 01:06:12.873
Then you will face the
repercussions.

580
01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:14.458
I'm done with this shit, man.

581
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:18.331
You know why this is?

582
01:06:18.333 --> 01:06:19.167
Yes.

583
01:06:21.292 --> 01:06:25.415
You must atone to redeem
for what you have done.

584
01:06:25.417 --> 01:06:26.792
I know, shit!

585
01:06:31.167 --> 01:06:33.417
Sounds like someone needs a
reminder.

586
01:06:34.542 --> 01:06:35.375
Damn you.

587
01:06:38.583 --> 01:06:41.248
What about you, Katrina?

588
01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:42.292
What did you do?

589
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:47.792
Cat got your tongue?

590
01:06:49.333 --> 01:06:50.125
Shut up.

591
01:06:51.917 --> 01:06:53.290
Mom of the year?

592
01:06:53.292 --> 01:06:54.375
Shut your mouth!

593
01:06:55.708 --> 01:06:57.081
What happened?

594
01:06:57.083 --> 01:06:58.956
Yeah, Katrina.

595
01:06:58.958 --> 01:07:00.206
What happened?

596
01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:01.042
You know.

597
01:07:03.583 --> 01:07:04.458
Is that it?

598
01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:07.831
Can we not have a bit more
color?

599
01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:12.125
Like, "don't leave mommy's
opiates lying around."

600
01:07:14.042 --> 01:07:17.250
But it goes with the
territory, doesn't it, HellKat?

601
01:07:18.875 --> 01:07:22.456
Blah, blah, blah. All this talk.

602
01:07:22.458 --> 01:07:24.708
We've gotta get on with the
grand finale.

603
01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.583
You're up, HellKat.

604
01:07:31.125 --> 01:07:33.208
And you too, big poppa pump.

605
01:07:43.083 --> 01:07:43.917
I won't do it.

606
01:07:45.542 --> 01:07:46.375
Me neither.

607
01:07:48.292 --> 01:07:49.708
Oh, yes, you will.

608
01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:54.542
You'll do anything to save your
boy.

609
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:59.831
And you?

610
01:07:59.833 --> 01:08:02.790
Your wife and your brother.

611
01:08:04.625 --> 01:08:06.623
Your wife and your brother.

612
01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:11.042
That's some real trailer
park shit.

613
01:08:11.917 --> 01:08:12.750
Oh!

614
01:08:13.625 --> 01:08:18.665
"I'd do anything to
atone for my mistakes."

615
01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:22.583
Oh, yeah.

616
01:08:24.792 --> 01:08:25.667
You'll do it.

617
01:08:26.917 --> 01:08:29.583
I think you'll do just about
anything.

618
01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:38.331
Oh, no!

619
01:08:38.333 --> 01:08:40.873
A chainsaw!

620
01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:44.873
And here's me, sittin' on a
tree!

621
01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:48.790
You will be punished for your
anger!

622
01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:51.665
You will be punished by your
anger!

623
01:08:51.667 --> 01:08:55.415
Come on, then!

624
01:09:54.125 --> 01:09:55.458
What the hell?

625
01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:03.208
God damn it.

626
01:10:06.083 --> 01:10:07.790
Are you gettin' it now?

627
01:10:07.792 --> 01:10:09.500
This is my world!

628
01:10:11.167 --> 01:10:12.456
Time to fight.

629
01:10:25.917 --> 01:10:29.917
They're like two scorpions
in a bottle.

630
01:10:35.708 --> 01:10:37.250
Jimmy, why ain't they fighting?

631
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.583
I think they need a bit of...

632
01:10:42.167 --> 01:10:43.000
Prodding.

633
01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:47.167
Yes, I think they do too.

634
01:11:19.833 --> 01:11:20.667
Matteo.

635
01:11:24.875 --> 01:11:25.708
Matteo?

636
01:14:10.542 --> 01:14:12.250
Come on, finish him.

637
01:14:16.333 --> 01:14:17.542
What're you waiting for?

638
01:14:19.792 --> 01:14:22.623
Kill him, Katrina.

639
01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.373
Kill the cock sucker!

640
01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:25.915
Shut up!

641
01:14:29.333 --> 01:14:30.167
This is it.

642
01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:32.458
Think of your son.

643
01:14:36.875 --> 01:14:39.292
I'll give you another chance.

644
01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.331
I'll make you a champion.

645
01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:44.917
Everybody will know who you are.

646
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.415
You'll be a legend.

647
01:14:47.417 --> 01:14:51.875
Everybody will know the name of
HellKat.

648
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.000
What're you doin'?

649
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.333
Get up.

650
01:15:13.417 --> 01:15:16.417
Stand up and fight for your
soul!

651
01:15:18.458 --> 01:15:19.292
No.

652
01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:24.040
Fight me!

653
01:15:24.042 --> 01:15:25.625
No more fighting.

654
01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:30.000
Fight for your pathetic son!

655
01:15:33.958 --> 01:15:34.792
Then die!

656
01:16:04.869 --> 01:16:09.869
