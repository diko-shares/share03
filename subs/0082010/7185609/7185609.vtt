That's East Proctor, and all about here
are the moors. I go this way.

27
00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.398
Thanks for the ride, sir.
You have lovely sheep.

28
00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:56.111
Boys, keep off the moors.
Stick to the roads, and the best of luck.

29
00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.822
Thanks again.
I'm gonna miss you.

30
00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.365
Bye, girls.

31
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:07.914
- You cold?
- Yeah.

32
00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.167
- Good.
- Jack!

33
00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.670
- David.
- You're not having a good time, are you?

34
00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.465
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, look around.

35
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.550
Isn't this a fun place?

36
00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:21.636
- Well, I like it here.
- Right.

37
00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:24.848
- Northern England first, Italy later.
- Right.

38
00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.726
- I mean, we've got three months.
- Right.

39
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.189
Those sheep shit on my pack.

40
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.362
You think she'll meet me in Rome?

41
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:42.949
I think Debbie Klein's a mediocre person
with a good body.

42
00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:46.244
There's nothing mediocre
about Debbie Klein's body.

43
00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.079
She's a jerk.

44
00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:50.040
You're talking about the woman I love.

45
00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.542
I'm talking about a girl you wanna fuck.
So give me a break.

46
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:56.505
All right.
Well... I have to make love to her.

47
00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.592
It's really very simple.
She has no choice.

48
00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:05.680
It just fascinates me how much energy
you spend on somebody so dull.

49
00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.684
There's nothing dull about that body.

50
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.772
We've known Debbie, what,
since the eighth grade?

51
00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.900
How many years of foreplay is that?

52
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.820
She says she likes me too much.

53
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.616
What are you worried
about Debbie Klein for, anyway?

54
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.743
There are gonna be plenty of girls
on this trip.

55
00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:29.079
Yeah, we're off to a great start!

56
00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.998
- Say, "Knock, knock."
- Knock, knock.

57
00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:34.167
- Who's there?
- Who?

58
00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.044
- Don't you get it?
- What?

59
00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.256
You don't get that joke?
All right, I'll try another.

60
00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.383
- Say, "Knock, knock."
- What?

61
00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.426
- Say, "Knock, knock."
- Who's there?

62
00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:47.681
- No, no, no. You say, "Knock, knock."
- Knock, knock.

63
00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.432
- Who's there?
- Who?

64
00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:51.184
No. You don't...

65
00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.048
You're right. It is a pub.

66
00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:26.177
Okay, what do you say,
we go in for a little food, drink, rest?

67
00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.472
"The Slaughtered Lamb"?

68
00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.643
That's kind of strange.

69
00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:37.564
- Where's the lamb?
- It's probably inside getting cold. Come on.

70
00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.525
No, really.
What kind of ad is that for a pub?

71
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.527
I don't know.
Would you rather the Hilton?

72
00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.155
All right, but whatever happens...

73
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.407
- ...it's your fault.
- It's my fault. All right, come on.

74
00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:01.838
- Hello.
- Hi. Nice to see you.

75
00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:05.675
It's very cold outside. May we come in?

76
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.030
- Yes. Do you have any hot soup?
- No.

77
00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:29.699
- Do you have any coffee, then?
- No.

78
00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.701
Do you have any hot chocolate?

79
00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:34.788
We have spirits and beers. If it's something
hot that you want, you can have tea.

80
00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.581
- Then you have tea?
- No.

81
00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:40.210
- Oh.
- But I can make some for you, if you like.

82
00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:42.379
Oh, yes, please.

83
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:56.017
- Nice-looking group.
- Hey, listen, at least it's warm in here.

84
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.561
Look at that.

85
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:02.649
- Yeah, what about it?
- It's a five-pointed star.

86
00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:05.276
Maybe the owners are from Texas.

87
00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:09.948
- Remember the Alamo.
- I beg your pardon?

88
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.993
- Oh, he was just joking.
- Joking?

89
00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:18.289
I remember "The Alamo". I saw it once
in London, in Leicester Square.

90
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:23.837
She means in the cinema,
that film with John Wayne.

91
00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.964
Oh, yeah, of course.

92
00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:27.674
Checkmate.

93
00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:31.386
Right. With Laurence Harvey.
Everybody dies in it. Very bloody.

94
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:34.889
- Bloody awful, if you ask me.

95
00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:38.560
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear
the one about the crashing plane?

96
00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.729
- Oh, no!
_Nah!

97
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.148
Let me speak!

98
00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:46.359
- Ask him what the candles are for.
- You ask him.

99
00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:50.488
All right, then. I shan't tell it.
No, no, you've had your chance.

100
00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:55.577
It's a pentangle, a five-pointed star.

101
00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.454
It's used in witchcraft.

102
00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:01.207
Ion Chaney Jr. in Universal Studios
maintained that's the mark of the Wolf Man.

103
00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:02.417
I see.

104
00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.754
You want me to ask them if they're
burning candles to ward off monsters?

105
00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.964
- Right.
- Wrong.

106
00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.008
All right, then!

107
00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:15.680
There was this airplane over the Atlantic
on its way to New York,

108
00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:19.934
and it was full of men
from the United Nations. Ha-ha!

109
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.271
- Go on, ask him.
- You ask him.

110
00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:27.400
So halfway over the ocean,
the engines run low on petrol.

111
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:30.028
So they have to lighten the plane.

112
00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:33.323
So they heave out all the baggage,
but it's still too heavy.

113
00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:37.410
So they chuck out all the seats,
but it's still too heavy.

114
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:42.832
Finally, this Frog, he steps up, shouts,
"Vive la France," and leaps out.

115
00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:46.169
- Then an Englishman, he steps up, shouts...
- Hear, hear!

116
00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:49.172
..."God save the Queen," and he leaps out.

117
00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:52.967
But the plane is still too heavy.

118
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:56.846
So the Yank delegate from Texas,
he steps up, shouts,

119
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.015
"Remember the Alamo,"

120
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.851
and chucks out the Mexican! Ha-ha!

121
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.528
Remember the Alamo!

122
00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:19.244
Excuse me.
What's that star on the wall for?

123
00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:32.966
You made me miss.

124
00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.428
Sorry.

125
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:40.807
I've never missed that board before.

126
00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:48.398
- Uh... Jack, we'd better go.
- Are you kidding? I'm starved.

127
00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:50.525
There's no food here.

128
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:56.281
- Shall we go, Jack?
- Apparently so.

129
00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:59.951
- You can't let them go.
- How much do we owe you?

130
00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:04.539
Nothing, lads. Go.
God be with you.

131
00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:10.503
- Er... thank you.
- Wait! You just can't let them go.

132
00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:13.923
Go. Stay on the road.

133
00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:17.093
Keep clear of the moors.

134
00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:23.224
- Thank you.
- Beware the moon, lads.

135
00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.645
Yeah...

136
00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.026
- What the hell was that all about?
- I don't know.

137
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.695
Let's go up the road and see
if there's an inn or something.

138
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.030
"Beware the moon"?

139
00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.991
Yeah, I know, Jack, but come on.
I'm freezing.

140
00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.743
- Where the hell are we going?
- Anywhere.

141
00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.037
I just want to get away
from The Slaughtered Lamb.

142
00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.331
Where to now, Kessler?
The Duck's Breath?

143
00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:49.334
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sure we'll find something else.

144
00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.252
- Weird fucking place.
- It was, man.

145
00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.546
But, boy, they could play darts.

146
00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:55.798
You can't let them go.

147
00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.719
Should the world know our business?

148
00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.597
- It's murder, then!
- Then murder it is.

149
00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:06.517
It's in God's hands now.

150
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:19.697
- What do you think was wrong?
- I have no idea.

151
00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:23.284
Maybe that pentangle was
for something supernatural.

152
00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.119
Oh, I see.

153
00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:29.582
And they were too embarrassed to talk
about it because they just felt so silly.

154
00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:32.252
- They were ashamed.
- Yeah.

155
00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:34.837
Oh, please, don't rain!

156
00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.923

00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:38.860
We must go to them!

172
00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:42.030
I heard nothing.

173
00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.286
Nor I.

174
00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:56.711
Did you hear that?

175
00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:59.672
- I heard that.
- What was it?

176
00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:03.259
Could be a lot of things.

177
00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:05.136
Yeah?

178
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:09.349
- A coyote.
- There aren't any coyotes in England.

179
00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:11.726
- The hound of the Baskervilles?
- Pecos Bill?

180
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.770
- Heathcliff.
- Heathcliff didn't howl.

181
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.938
No, but he was on the moors.

182
00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:19.984
It's a full moon.

183
00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:21.861
"Beware the moon."

184
00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:25.323
"And stick to the road." Oops.

185
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.663
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.

186
00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.248
Yeah.

187
00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:45.134
Hey, wait a minute. We're lost.

188
00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:48.554
- Oh, shit, David. What is that?

189
00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:50.765
- I don't know. Come on.
- "Come on" where?

190
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.559
Anywhere.
I think we should just keep moving.

191
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.493
It's moving.

192
00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.704
It's circling us.

193
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.331
Oh, fuck.

194
00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:19.335
- What's the plan?
- Plan?

195
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.088
Let's just keep walking.

196
00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:25.091
That's right.
A lovely stroll on the moors.

197
00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.760
Tra-la-la-la. Isn't this fun?

198
00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.017
It's in front of us.

199
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.937
Do you think it's a dog?

200
00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:41.023
Oh, shit. What is it?

201
00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:44.819
It's a sheepdog or something.
Come on. Turn slowly. Let's walk away.

202
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.988
Nice doggy. Good boy.

203
00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:49.240
- Come on, Jack. Walk away.
- Walking away. Yes.

204
00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:50.950
Here we are walking away.

205
00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.664
- Can you see anything?
- No.

206
00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:01.878
- Sounds far away.
- Not far enough. Come on.

207
00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.337
- But, Jack.
- What?

208
00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.631
- Where are we going?
- I dunno, I'll tell you when we get there.

209
00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:12.847
- You really scared me, you shithead.
- You gonna help me up or what?

210
00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:18.144
Jesus! Fuck! Jesus!

211
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:23.691
Jesus! Fuck!
Oh, God! Help! Help!

212
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.740
- It's killing me!
- Jack...

213
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:41.584
Jack...

214
00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.256
Jack?

215
00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:32.927
Mr. Kessler?

216
00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.472
Mr. Kessler?

217
00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:39.767
I'm going to look into your eyes.

218
00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:47.984
- Is he all right?
- Yes, I should think.

219
00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:52.029
- He called out just now.
- He's American, you know.

220
00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:55.324
Dr. Hirsch's gonna fetch one of them
embassy fellas to see him.

221
00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:58.661
- His chart says he's from New York.
- Oh, I think he's a Jew.

222
00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:01.581
- What makes you say that?
- I've had a look.

223
00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:04.417
Really, Susan, that wasn't very proper.

224
00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:06.586
Besides, it's common practise now.

225
00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:09.130
Nurse Gallagher,
Nurse Price is quite right.

226
00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:13.134
Dr. Hirsch,
Mr. Kessler called out just now.

227
00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:17.388
Nurse Gallagher, surely you perform
some function here at the hospital?

228
00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:20.141
- Yes, Doctor.
- Then get on with it.

229
00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:21.684
Yes, Doctor.

230
00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.197
Can I be of service, Nurse Price?

231
00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:38.200
- Dr. Hirsch?
- Go about your duties.

232
00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.744
Yes, Doctor.

233
00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.788
- Oh, Nurse Price.
- Yes, Doctor?

234
00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:46.208
- What exactly did he call out?
- He said, "Jack."

235
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.254
That would be Jack Goodman,
the boy who was killed.

236
00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:52.214
What happened to them?

237
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.468
The police report said they were attacked
by an escaped lunatic.

238
00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:57.595
Must've been a very powerful man.

239
00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:03.476
Although I don't see that
it's any concern of yours, Nurse Price.

240
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:06.479
No, sir. Of course, sir.

241
00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:08.314
Good day, Doctor.

242
00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:33.881
Hello, David.

243
00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:41.430
I'm Dr. Hirsch.
This is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.

244
00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:46.686
- Where am I?
- You're in a hospital in London.

245
00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:49.855
London?

246
00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:52.733
Where's Jack?

247
00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:56.737
David, I'd like you to prepare yourself.

248
00:19:57.613 --> 00:19:59.699
Your friend is dead.

249
00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:02.993
What? Ow!

250
00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.495
Shit.

251
00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.582
Jack is dead?

252
00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:13.254
Hi. I'm Mr. Collins of the American
Embassy here in Grosvenor Square.

253
00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:16.841
Both Mr. Goodman's parents
and your parents have been notified

254
00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:19.009
of your injuries,
and everything's in order.

255
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.180
Who are you people?

256
00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:26.726
What's going on here? Where's Jack?
Get your hands off me!

257
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:30.146
- Let go of me. I wanna see Jack!
- Nurse!

258
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:33.274
- I wanna see Jack.
- Mr. Kessler!

259
00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:37.737
I appreciate how upsetting this must be
for you, but please, Mr. Kessler!

260
00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:39.655
Twenty milligrammes Sagittal 1V, please.

261
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.452
I appreciate how upset you are,
but this is no reason for hysterics.

262
00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:48.914
Mr. Kessler?
Mr. Kessler, try not to excite yourself!

263
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.002
I shall come back and check on your
progress and send a report to your parents.

264
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:58.174
The police have requested to interview you,
and I have given them permission to do so.

265
00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.926
Thank you very much, Mr. Collins.
He'll rest now.

266
00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:03.429
I'm sure everything will be fine
once he's adjusted.

267
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:05.431
He's had quite a shock.

268
00:21:05.556 --> 00:21:09.393
These dumb-ass kids. They never
appreciate anything you do for them.

269
00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:13.981
How long have I been here?

270
00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.817
You've been unconscious
since you were brought in three weeks ago.

271
00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:20.196
- Three weeks?
- You've suffered some cuts and bruises.

272
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:23.783
Lost a little blood. Nothing serious.
Black and blue for a while.

273
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.912
You'll have some duelling scars
to boast of.

274
00:21:28.037 --> 00:21:30.247
That lunatic must've been
a very fierce fellow.

275
00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:32.374
They say a madman
has the strength of 10.

276
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.210
Lunatic?

277
00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:36.712
We've given you a pretty strong sedative.
Rest now.

278
00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:40.466
Nurse Price will see to all your needs.
You rest.

279
00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:44.970
- It wasn't a lunatic.
- I beg your pardon?

280
00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:47.515
- It was an animal.
- What?

281
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.185
A wolf.

282
00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:54.230
Did he say a wolf?

283
00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:56.649
Yes, I believe he did.

284
00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:00.236
Oh, I'm sure I shall.

285
00:22:00.361 --> 00:22:03.739
If I survived Rommel, I'm sure
I can survive another excruciating evening

286
00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:06.075
with Roger Matheson!

287
00:22:07.785 --> 00:22:09.870
Be a good girl. Bye, now.

288
00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:16.335
Yes?

289
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.089
'Inspector Villiers and Sergeant
McManus are here to see you, Doctor.'

290
00:22:20.214 --> 00:22:21.841
Send them in.

291
00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:25.761
- Dr. Hirsch.
- Come in. Come in. Please sit down.

292
00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:29.348
- Some tea?
- No, thank you.

293
00:22:29.473 --> 00:22:31.725
Uh... I'd like some tea, please.

294
00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:34.895
Uh... maybe not. No, thanks.
Maybe later.

295
00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:38.524
- No problem.
- No, thank you, Doctor.

296
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.527
Well, then, what can I do
for Scotland Yard?

297
00:22:41.652 --> 00:22:45.781
Uh... we understand the Kessler boy
has regained consciousness.

298
00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:48.450
Uh... sorry. Sorry.

299
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.746
Has Mr. Kessler said anything
regarding the attack on the moors?

300
00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:55.499
- Excuse me. Yes?

301
00:22:55.624 --> 00:22:58.544
- 'Roger Matheson, Doctor.'
- I'm not here.

302
00:22:58.669 --> 00:23:00.504
- 'He's on the telephone.'
- Tell him I'm out.

303
00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:03.048
Tell him I've passed away,
an old war wound.

304
00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:08.429
Just tell him I'm dead!
No more calls.

305
00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:34.288
I'm sorry if I conflict with your report,
Inspector,

306
00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:36.665
but Jack and I were not attacked
by a man!

307
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.543
- Hmm... So you've said.
- He may have a point, sir.

308
00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:44.214
Two strong boys would be able to defend
themselves against one man.

309
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.758
Sergeant McManus,

310
00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:49.261
are you suggesting that David and Jack
were in fact attacked by some animal

311
00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:53.807
and that the officialdom of East Proctor
has conspired to keep it a secret?

312
00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:57.811
We have an autopsy report on the murderer
who was shot in the act by the local police.

313
00:23:57.937 --> 00:24:00.064
We have two witnesses to the crime.

314
00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.276
You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler,
if I consider your testimony

315
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:07.237
as coming from someone
who has gone through a terrible shock.

316
00:24:07.363 --> 00:24:09.573
Inspector, the boy seems
all right to me and...

317
00:24:09.698 --> 00:24:11.700
And what, Sergeant?

318
00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:17.414
- And I don't rightly know, sir.
- That is precisely my point.

319
00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:20.292
David, as far as we're concerned,
the matter is now closed.

320
00:24:20.417 --> 00:24:23.629
We will trouble you no further.
Good day. Doctor.

321
00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.845
<i>- There were witnesses?
- So they said.</i>

322
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:35.391
How could there have been witnesses?
It was so dark.

323
00:24:35.516 --> 00:24:37.267
We were running, and I fell,

324
00:24:37.393 --> 00:24:40.354
and Jack went to help me up,
and this thing came from nowhere.

325
00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:43.065
I don't know what they're talking about.

326
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.943
In time, I'm sure
it'll all come back to you.

327
00:24:46.068 --> 00:24:48.487
Doctor, my memory is fine.

328
00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:50.823
It's my sanity
I'm beginning to worry about.

329
00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:39.204
- Hello, Benjamin.
- No.

330
00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:40.956
- No what?
- No.

331
00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:44.918
Well, all right, then, be like that.
Here. Swallow this.

332
00:25:47.838 --> 00:25:49.798
Want some water?

333
00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:56.430
- Feeling better?
- No!

334
00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:02.269
What a lot of lovely comics you've got.

335
00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.354
- Do you like them?
- No.

336
00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:06.231
Right.

337
00:26:13.655 --> 00:26:16.200
- How's the patient in 217
- The American? Yes, yes, yes.

338
00:26:16.325 --> 00:26:18.410
- How did he look?
- What do you mean how did he look?

339
00:26:18.535 --> 00:26:20.788
Does he seem depressed?
Do you think he'll eat his food?

340
00:26:20.913 --> 00:26:24.458
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist.
I push things around.

341
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:27.252
- What happens to them, I don't know.
- Thank you.

342
00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:44.895
- Mr. Kessler.
-Yes?

343
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.068
- You haven't eaten your lunch.
- Well, I'm not very hungry, thank you.

344
00:26:51.193 --> 00:26:54.363
- I'm afraid you have to eat something.
- What?

345
00:26:55.823 --> 00:26:57.866
You have to eat something.

346
00:26:58.784 --> 00:27:01.036
No, really, thanks, I'm not hungry.

347
00:27:05.249 --> 00:27:07.835
You put me in an awkward position,
Mr. Kessler.

348
00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.963
- How did I do that?
- You're to take these after you've eaten.

349
00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:15.300
What sort of nurse would I be if I failed in
so simple a task as handing out some pills?

350
00:27:16.218 --> 00:27:19.096
- Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
- Sorry.

351
00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:26.937
- Oh, come on, Nurse Price.
- You can call me Alex.

352
00:27:27.062 --> 00:27:29.022
Come on, Alex!

353
00:27:31.108 --> 00:27:33.318
Shall I be forced to feed you,
Mr. Kessler?

354
00:27:33.443 --> 00:27:36.280
You can call me David.

355
00:27:36.405 --> 00:27:39.241
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?

356
00:27:40.659 --> 00:27:44.288
You know, this is absurd.
I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.

357
00:27:44.997 --> 00:27:46.874
Right...

358
00:28:02.556 --> 00:28:06.476
- Let's try a little harder, shall we?
- Would you give me a break?

359
00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:09.354
Ow!

360
00:28:21.783 --> 00:28:25.037
Will I have to take
such drastic action again, David?

361
00:28:54.775 --> 00:28:56.652
You've never had bad dreams before?

362
00:28:56.777 --> 00:29:00.864
Sure, as a kid, but never so real.
Never so weird.

363
00:29:01.782 --> 00:29:03.825
Did you get a good look at the man
who attacked you?

364
00:29:03.951 --> 00:29:06.954
Doctor, I told you. It wasn't a man.

365
00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:10.165
It was an animal.
A big wolf or something.

366
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:14.169
- A rabid dog.
- Let's have a look, shall we?

367
00:29:14.294 --> 00:29:18.757
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I was traumatised,
but Jack was torn apart.

368
00:29:18.882 --> 00:29:23.136
I saw him. A man can't do that
to someone with his bare hands.

369
00:29:23.262 --> 00:29:26.390
You'd be surprised
what horrors a man is capable of.

370
00:29:26.515 --> 00:29:29.142
- Did you see Jack?
- No.

371
00:29:29.268 --> 00:29:32.271
In fact, your wounds had been cleaned
and dressed before you arrived here.

372
00:29:32.396 --> 00:29:36.817
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor?
Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?

373
00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:38.485
I really don't know.

374
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.363
Then why the hell are you so quick
to disbelieve me?

375
00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:46.243
- You think I'm crazy.
- David, please. The police are satisfied.

376
00:29:46.368 --> 00:29:49.746
And I'm certain if there were a monster
roaming around Northern England,

377
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:51.748
we'd have seen it on the telly.

378
00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:54.918
Now you'll be leaving this hospital
in three or four days.

379
00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:57.629
Please, remain sane.

380
00:29:58.839 --> 00:30:01.717
At least until you're no longer
our responsibility.

381
00:30:02.426 --> 00:30:04.344
Dr. Hirsch.

382
00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:07.472
I'd rather not be by myself.

383
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.018
I'll send someone in
to keep you company.

384
00:30:36.168 --> 00:30:38.378
You're a very beautiful girl.

385
00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:44.551
- I thought you were asleep.
- I was.

386
00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:50.807
- Shall I read to you?
- Yeah, okay.

387
00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:55.520
"A Connecticut Yankee
at King Arthur's Court"

388
00:30:55.645 --> 00:30:57.939
by Samuel L. Clemens.

389
00:30:58.065 --> 00:31:00.734
This is after the preface
but before chapter one.

390
00:31:01.193 --> 00:31:03.362
"A Word of Explanation."

391
00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:06.114
"It was in Warwick Castle that
I came across the curious stranger

392
00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:08.492
"who I'm going to talk about.

393
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:12.746
"He attracted me by three things:
his candid simplicity,

394
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:15.374
"his marvellous familiarity
with ancient armour,

395
00:31:15.499 --> 00:31:19.127
"and the restfulness of his company,
for he did all the talking.

396
00:31:19.252 --> 00:31:21.088
"We fell together, as modest people will,

397
00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:23.507
"in the tail of the herd
that was being shown through,

398
00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:26.259
"and he at once began to say things
which interested me."

399
00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:29.763
- ...number tonight.'
- 'Puppetry is an art form, Piggy.'

400
00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:33.850
- "You call that violence "art"?"
- 'Well, violence belongs with puppetry.'

401
00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:36.853
- 'He's hitting her!'
- 'Punch and Judy is always violent.'

402
00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:39.940
- 'Punch and Judy?'
- 'It's a good, aggressive behaviour.'

403
00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:43.402
- 'Better than my act?'

404
00:31:43.527 --> 00:31:45.987
'I was going
to bite you very badly.'

405
00:31:46.113 --> 00:31:49.032
- Get the door!

406
00:31:51.326 --> 00:31:53.203
I'll get it.

407
00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:56.998
- All right, all right. Hold your horses!

408
00:31:58.375 --> 00:32:00.127
All right, already.

409
00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:07.509
Stop!

410
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.389
'And now, ladies and gentlemen...

411
00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:40.292
Hello.
Have you been up long?

412
00:32:41.042 --> 00:32:43.753
I've just had a nightmare.

413
00:32:43.879 --> 00:32:46.465
Not to worry. I have just the thing.

414
00:32:53.597 --> 00:32:55.265
Alex!

415
00:32:58.226 --> 00:32:59.561
Holy shit.

416
00:33:07.444 --> 00:33:11.406
Oh, you're up?
Good morning, and a good day to you.

417
00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:13.408
We have quite a meal here for you.

418
00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:17.329
Bacon and eggs, porridge,
orange juice and toast with jam.

419
00:33:17.454 --> 00:33:22.125
Good stuff there. Now you eat it up, and
I'll be back for the dishes when you finish.

420
00:33:24.628 --> 00:33:26.296
Good morning.

421
00:33:40.435 --> 00:33:42.729
Can I have a piece of toast?

422
00:33:43.647 --> 00:33:47.400
- Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
- Thanks a lot.

423
00:33:49.152 --> 00:33:51.696
No. I can't take this.

424
00:33:52.948 --> 00:33:55.450
Am I asleep now, awake or what?

425
00:33:55.575 --> 00:33:57.869
I realise I don't look so hot, David,

426
00:33:57.994 --> 00:34:00.455
but I thought you'd be glad to see me.

427
00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:06.044
David! You're hurting my feelings.

428
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:08.421
Hurting your feelings?

429
00:34:08.547 --> 00:34:11.007
Has it occurred to you
that it might be unsettling

430
00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:13.760
to see you rise from the grave
to visit me?

431
00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:17.764
Sorry to be upsetting you, David,
but I had to come.

432
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.268
Aren't you supposed to be buried
some place in New York?

433
00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:24.145
Yeah. Your parents came
to my funeral.

434
00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:26.898
I was surprised
at how many people came.

435
00:34:27.023 --> 00:34:30.068
Why should you be surprised?
You were a very well-liked person.

436
00:34:30.193 --> 00:34:32.654
- Yeah. I was, wasn't I?
- Well, I liked you.

437
00:34:33.446 --> 00:34:37.742
- Debbie Klein cried a lot.
- Oh, God. Am I asleep now or what?

438
00:34:37.867 --> 00:34:39.953
So... So you know what she does?

439
00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:44.916
She's so grief-stricken, she runs
to find solace in Mark Levine's bed.

440
00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:47.419
Mark Levine?

441
00:34:47.544 --> 00:34:50.964
An asshole.
Life mocks me even in death.

442
00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:54.759
I'm going completely crazy.

443
00:34:56.303 --> 00:34:58.513
- David!
- What?

444
00:34:59.598 --> 00:35:03.935
Now, I'm really sorry to be upsetting you,
but I have to warn you.

445
00:35:04.644 --> 00:35:07.522
- Warn me?
- We were attacked by a werewolf.

446
00:35:07.647 --> 00:35:09.774
- I'm not listening to this.
- On the moors.

447
00:35:09.899 --> 00:35:13.695
We were attacked
by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.

448
00:35:14.613 --> 00:35:17.282
I was murdered. An unnatural death.

449
00:35:17.741 --> 00:35:21.953
And now I walk the Earth in limbo
until the werewolf's curse is lifted.

450
00:35:22.078 --> 00:35:26.207
- Shut up.
- The wolf's bloodline must be severed.

451
00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:30.420
The last remaining werewolf
must be destroyed.

452
00:35:34.174 --> 00:35:36.217
It's you, David.

453
00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:41.431
- What?
- Please believe me. You'll kill people.

454
00:35:41.556 --> 00:35:44.017
- Nurse!
- Listen to me!

455
00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:45.185
Nurse!

456
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:50.148
The supernatural,
the power of darkness, it's all true.

457
00:35:50.607 --> 00:35:52.359
The undead surround me.

458
00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:55.111
Have you ever talked to a corpse?

459
00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:56.655
It's boring.

460
00:35:57.238 --> 00:35:58.740
I'm lonely.

461
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:02.118
Take your life, David.

462
00:36:02.243 --> 00:36:06.498
Kill yourself before you Kill others.

463
00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:11.461
Please don't cry.

464
00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:21.346
Beware the moon, David.

465
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:28.228
David. David!

466
00:36:29.604 --> 00:36:31.523
David, what's wrong?

467
00:36:37.153 --> 00:36:38.738
I'm a werewolf.

468
00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:41.616
A werewolf?

469
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:48.373
Are you all right now?

470
00:36:48.498 --> 00:36:51.668
I don't know.
I'll let you know the next full moon.

471
00:36:51.793 --> 00:36:56.172
David, you're going to be discharged
tomorrow. Will you be all right?

472
00:36:56.297 --> 00:36:58.174
My friend Jack was just here.

473
00:36:59.968 --> 00:37:02.679
- Your dead friend Jack?
- Yes.

474
00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:07.851
He told me that I will become
a monster in two days.

475
00:37:09.018 --> 00:37:10.854
What do you think?

476
00:37:10.979 --> 00:37:12.897
What do I think?

477
00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:15.525
About the possibility of you
becoming a monster in two days

478
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.069
or about visits from dead friends?

479
00:37:20.613 --> 00:37:22.449
I was dreaming again?

480
00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:26.578
Yes, I would think so.

481
00:37:27.412 --> 00:37:29.414
I think so, too.

482
00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:39.507
Do you have somewhere to stay
in London?

483
00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:45.388
Remember, I'm just a working girl,
so don't expect too much.

484
00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:48.141
- Do you live by yourself?
- Yes.

485
00:37:49.392 --> 00:37:50.727
Good.

486
00:37:51.728 --> 00:37:55.732
Uh... there's a shop on the corner.
We'll get some food.

487
00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:08.328
This stuff's expensive.

488
00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:11.664
It's outrageous. My pay can't
possibly keep up with inflation.

489
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:15.210
- How do you live?
- Carefully.

490
00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:20.942
- This is the, uh living room.
- Ah. You mind if I get rid of this?

491
00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:23.069
- Oh, please.
- Thank you.

492
00:39:34.998 --> 00:39:37.000
- The kitchen.
- Very nice.

493
00:39:41.713 --> 00:39:43.590
- Closet.
- Charming.

494
00:39:47.844 --> 00:39:50.763
- The bathroom.
- Lovely.

495
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.396
The bedroom.

496
00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:02.400
There's only one bed.

497
00:40:05.194 --> 00:40:07.614
I'll be perfectly honest with you, David.

498
00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:11.451
I'm not in the habit of bringing home
stray, young American men.

499
00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:13.286
I should hope not.

500
00:40:15.204 --> 00:40:19.584
I find you very attractive
and a little bit sad.

501
00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.669
Go on.

502
00:40:23.713 --> 00:40:29.218
I've had seven lovers in my life,
three of which were one-night stands.

503
00:40:29.344 --> 00:40:31.888
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

504
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.811
Perhaps you'd like to watch telly

Don't be a putz, David.

523
00:43:24.936 --> 00:43:26.562
Come here.

00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:33.486

525
00:43:35.321 --> 00:43:37.740
Shh! Come on.

526
00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:05.101
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

527
00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:08.688
- Hi, David!
- Put that down.

528
00:44:12.233 --> 00:44:14.735
Okay, you've seen me.
Now go away.

529
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:20.449
I'm sorry I'm upsetting you, David,
but you don't understand what's going on.

530
00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:22.493
I understand, all right.

531
00:44:22.618 --> 00:44:25.538
You're one of the "undead,"
and I'm a werewolf.

532
00:44:26.247 --> 00:44:28.416
Yes. That's right.

533
00:44:28.541 --> 00:44:30.710
Get out of here, Jack.

534
00:44:32.587 --> 00:44:34.964
Tomorrow night's the full moon.

535
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:37.800
You're gonna change. You'll become...

536
00:44:37.925 --> 00:44:41.220
I know. I know. A monster.

537
00:44:43.222 --> 00:44:46.809
You gotta Kill yourself, David,
before it's too |late.

538
00:44:53.816 --> 00:44:55.860
Are you really dead, Jack?

539
00:44:56.402 --> 00:44:58.321
What do you think?

540
00:44:58.446 --> 00:45:00.865
I think I've lost my mind.

541
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:05.995
I think you're not real. I think you're
just another part of a bad dream.

542
00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:08.956
You gotta believe me, David.

543
00:45:09.081 --> 00:45:12.210
Believe what? That tomorrow night
beneath the full moon

544
00:45:12.335 --> 00:45:14.712
I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people?

545
00:45:14.837 --> 00:45:19.383
- Bullshit!
- Oh, God-damn it, David, please believe me.

546
00:45:19.508 --> 00:45:22.053
You'll kill and make others like me.

547
00:45:22.178 --> 00:45:24.138
I'm not having a nice time here.

548

You gotta take your own life.

549
00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:33.814
I will not accept this. Go away.

550
00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:36.567
David?

551
00:45:39.779 --> 00:45:41.739
This is not pretend, David.

552
00:45:41.864 --> 00:45:44.784
I will not be threatened
by a walking meatloaf!

553
00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:48.955
David?

554
00:45:50.039 --> 00:45:52.333
What's wrong? I heard voices.

555
00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:56.045
It was just me, Alex.
Just me being crazy.

556
00:45:56.921 --> 00:46:00.716
- Are you all right?
- No, I don't think so.

557
00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:05.471
Come back to bed now.

558
00:46:08.224 --> 00:46:10.810
Do I seem crazy to you?

559
00:46:10.935 --> 00:46:13.062
David, what is the matter?

560
00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:16.482
I just saw Jack again.

561
00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:18.776
Where? Here?

562
00:46:19.986 --> 00:46:21.362
Yeah.

563
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.366
What did he say?

564
00:46:26.492 --> 00:46:29.578
He said that tomorrow
I'll turn into a monster.

565
00:46:31.163 --> 00:46:32.999
Do you believe him?

566
00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:36.711
Do you believe me?

567
00:46:37.545 --> 00:46:40.047
I believe that you're very upset.

568
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:42.967
I believe that you loved him very much,

569
00:46:43.092 --> 00:46:45.970
and that somehow you blame yourself
for his death.

570
00:46:49.265 --> 00:46:51.225
Did you ever see "The Wolf Man"?

571
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:53.811
- Is that the one with Oliver Reed?
- No, the old one.

572
00:46:53.936 --> 00:46:55.646
I don't think so.

573
00:46:56.105 --> 00:47:00.109
Bela Lugosi bites Ion Chaney Jr.
and he turns into a werewolf.

574
00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:03.988
- Why are you telling me this?
- No, listen.

575
00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:09.160
Claude Rains is Ion Chaney's father,
and he ends up killing him.

576
00:47:09.285 --> 00:47:10.619
So?

577
00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:17.251
Well, I think that a werewolf can only
be killed by someone who loves him.

578
00:47:17.376 --> 00:47:19.420
What are you talking about?

579
00:47:21.005 --> 00:47:23.549
I don't know what I'm talking about.

580
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:30.014
I'm torn between feeling
very sorry for you

581
00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:33.351
and finding you terribly attractive.

582
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.852
- A drink for a very cold man.
- Good afternoon. What can I get you?

583
00:48:57.977 --> 00:49:01.689
Ah... A Campari soda
would do very nice, I think.

584
00:49:01.814 --> 00:49:03.774
Sorry, love.

585
00:49:08.195 --> 00:49:11.824
Oh, well, then a small Guinness
will suffice.

586
00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:20.583
Nasty business with those two
young American boys, wasn't it?

587
00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:25.045
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Yes, I'm sure I'm right.

588
00:49:25.171 --> 00:49:28.299
A few weeks back.
Last full moon, wasn't it?

589
00:49:28.424 --> 00:49:32.094
I mean, the escaped lunatic,
the one who killed the boy.

590
00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:34.680
A thousand thanks, madam.
There we are.

591
00:49:36.182 --> 00:49:38.517
Well, that was around here, wasn't it?

592
00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.478
Where are you from, sir?

593
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.147
London.

594
00:49:43.272 --> 00:49:44.690
Excuse me.

595
00:49:47.943 --> 00:49:49.904
Knight takes pawn.

596
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:53.282
What?

597
00:49:54.074 --> 00:49:55.326
Oh, yeah.

598
00:49:59.538 --> 00:50:01.081
Cheers.

599
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:14.261
- Oh, what's that?
- Oh, that's been there for 200 years, sir.

600
00:50:14.386 --> 00:50:18.974
We were going to paint it out,
but it's traditional, so we left it.

601
00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:21.185
Ah... I see.

602
00:50:23.562 --> 00:50:26.232
So, you've heard nothing
of this incident?

603
00:50:27.233 --> 00:50:29.318
- Incident?
- The murder.

604
00:50:33.197 --> 00:50:36.075
- You a police officer?
- Oh, good Lord, no, no.

605
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:41.330
No, I'm a doctor. I work in the hospital
where they brought the Kessler boy.

606
00:50:41.455 --> 00:50:45.543
He was talking about werewolves.
Monsters.

607
00:50:45.668 --> 00:50:48.087
Well, I happened to be in the area,
so I thought...

608
00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:49.713
You thought what?

609
00:50:51.006 --> 00:50:53.634
I thought I'd look into the boy's story.

610
00:50:53.759 --> 00:50:56.804
- Story about werewolves?
- Hmm...

611
00:50:56.929 --> 00:50:58.264
Really, sir.

612
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.440
Like a game?

613
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.986
- Well?
- I think not.

614
00:51:12.111 --> 00:51:16.657
- Surely I'm not that impressive.
- No. No, sir, you're not.

615
00:51:17.491 --> 00:51:19.994
I don't feel like a game.

616
00:51:22.454 --> 00:51:25.416
- You off now?
- Aye. I'll not be long.

617
00:51:26.292 --> 00:51:30.254
- I just wanna check on the dogs.
- The dogs are fine.

618
00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:34.383
I'll just check.

619
00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:50.065
Quite a long drive to London.
Do you have anything to eat?

620
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:54.111
- No. There's no food here.
- There's nothing for you here, sir.

621
00:51:57.948 --> 00:51:59.241
Well...

622
00:52:01.118 --> 00:52:03.329
I'll be on my way, then.

623
00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:34.777
Hello.

624
00:52:36.278 --> 00:52:39.990
Are you listening? That boy's in danger.

625
00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:47.122
I mean... it were a mistake
to let him leave here.

626
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.002
There's something wrong with this place.

627
00:52:52.127 --> 00:52:54.046
That much I understand.

628
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:56.548
It's the one who lived.

629
00:52:57.341 --> 00:53:00.427
He's the one who's in danger,
and not just him.

630
00:53:00.886 --> 00:53:03.180
Others will be, too.

631
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.018
It's almost full moon.

632
00:53:08.977 --> 00:53:11.021
He'll change.

633
00:53:11.146 --> 00:53:12.981
- He'll...
- That's enough!

634
00:53:15.401 --> 00:53:17.111
That's enough!

635
00:53:35.796 --> 00:53:38.048
If you get too anxious,
call me at the hospital, okay?

636
00:53:38.173 --> 00:53:39.299
Okay.

637
00:53:39.425 --> 00:53:42.636
- I've left those pills for you.
- A doper werewolf.

638
00:53:42.761 --> 00:53:44.972
I'm off.

639
00:53:45.097 --> 00:53:46.515

640
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.227

- Why?

What are we doing?

708
01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:15.899
We're going to creep up round the stairs
and give him a right old scare.

709
01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:20.028
- Hey, did you hear something?
- Just now?

710
01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:22.072
- Yes.

711
01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:30.747
Sean, those hooligans
are in the park again.

712
01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.668
Aren't you ready yet?
They'll be here any minute.

713
01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:38.296
There's something going on out there.

714
01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:43.677
- Is Nurse Price on duty this evening?
- Yes, Doctor.

715
01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:46.805
Nurse Gallagher, do you know if Nurse Price
has seen the Kessler boy since his release?

716
01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:50.350
Uh... I don't know.

717
01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:54.521
- Yes, Doctor, I have.
- Come to my office, Nurse Price.

718
01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:06.241
Is anyone there?

719
01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:14.374
Sit down, Alex.

720
01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:19.129
I was in East Proctor today.

721
01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:22.590
- I'm concerned about David.
- Yes, sir.

722
01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:25.176
There's a full moon. Where is he?

723
01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:28.179
- He's at my flat.
- What's the number?

724
01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:30.515
- I'm off at midnight, and...
- Your number.

725
01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.906
Is that you, Harry?

726
01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:10.138
- No, he's not there.
- He's not?

727
01:04:11.973 --> 01:04:13.391
Alex...

728
01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:17.270
Has David persisted
in his werewolf fantasies?

729
01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:21.858
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong?
Is this more serious than I know?

730
01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:25.195
I tried to investigate the attack.
There are no records.

731
01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:30.784
The case was closed.
Now they've "misplaced" the file.

732
01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:34.079
David's lacerations were cleaned
and dressed before he arrived here.

733
01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:37.582
Yet supposedly, no other doctor
examined him before I did.

734
01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:40.085
The Goodman boy's in the ground already,
he's no use to us.

735
01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:45.090
So, I went to the pub in East Proctor today,
where I was convinced of two things.

736
01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:49.677
They were lying. There were
no witnesses, no escaped lunatic.

737
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.598
The whole community is hiding the truth
of what actually happened up there.

738
01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:55.767
Surely, you don't mean...

739
01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:59.646
David has suffered a severe trauma.

740
01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:04.359
I myself witnessed some form
of mass neurosis in East Proctor.

741
01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.528
If all the villagers believe

742
01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:09.572
that Jack Goodman was killed
by a werewolf, why shouldn't David?

743
01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:13.660
And then it follows that if he survived
an attack by a werewolf,

744
01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:17.330
wouldn't he himself become
a werewolf at the next full moon?

745
01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:22.085
Oh, I don't mean running about
on all fours and howling at the moon,

746
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:25.880
but in such a deranged state, he might
harm himself or perhaps other people.

747
01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:30.009
- What shall we do?
- I think we should call the police.

748
01:05:52.866 --> 01:05:55.660
Here, old Winston smells something.

749
01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:03.918
- Let him go!
- Hey! Find what it is.

750
01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:07.172
- That's it.
- Brave dog, that.

751
01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:09.299
Here! Who's there?

752
01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:14.471
That's not Winston.

753
01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:20.101
Look. There!

754
01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:22.479
What's...

755
01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.148
Mary, mother of God!

756
01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:19.327
Hello?

757
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.872
Is there someone there?

758
01:07:29.254 --> 01:07:32.048
I can assure you that
this is not in the least bit amusing.

759
01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:36.719
I shall report this!

760
01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:16.676
Good Lord.

761
01:10:05.576 --> 01:10:08.913
Uh... hello, wolves. Nice wolves.

762
01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:12.041
Uh... I'm gonna...
I'll be right back, okay?

763
01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:15.002
Just, uh... take any calls.

764
01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:17.088
Uh... Oh, boy!

765
01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:30.768
No, Dr. Hirsch,
he hasn't come back yet.

766
01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:33.688
Yes, I will.

767
01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:38.317
But I feel so helpless
just sitting around here doing nothing.

768
01:10:39.777 --> 01:10:42.572
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.

769
01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:13.603
Excuse me.

770
01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:22.653
Hey, kid!
Little boy with the balloons!

771
01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:27.533
Come over here!

772
01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.537
If you come over here,
I'll give you a pound.

773
01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:34.373
Two pounds.

774
01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.258
I don't know who you are.

775
01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:47.345
I'm the famous balloon thief.

776
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:50.598
Why would a thief want to give me
two pounds?

777
01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.308
Here, I'll explain it to you.

778
01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.563
Thank you.

779
01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:12.787
- Yes, love?
- A naked American man stole my balloons.

780
01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:13.913
What?

781
01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:25.508
Twenty pence, please, sir.

782
01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:28.052
Sorry.

783
01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:02.211
Lot of weather we've been having lately.

784
01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:26.485
Good morning!

785
01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:32.450
- I'm freezing.
- David!

786
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.412
Where on earth have you been?

787
01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:38.789
Alex, you won't believe this.

788
01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:45.129
I've lost my mind. I woke up in the zoo.

789
01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:48.299
- The zoo.
- What did I do last night?

790
01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:49.675
You don't remember?

791
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.845
Well, I remember seeing you
to the door, and then...

792
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:55.556
saying goodbye,
getting locked out of the flat.

793
01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:58.726
Then I came in through the front window,
I started to read,

794
01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:00.728
and then I woke up naked at the zoo.

795
01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:03.481
I was worried about you.
We didn't know where you were.

796
01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:05.024
Oh!

797
01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.319
Where did you get that coat?

798
01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:12.949
I'll get it.

799
01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:17.495
- Hello?
- Alex, have you heard anything?

800
01:14:18.663 --> 01:14:19.872
He's here.

801
01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:21.749
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me?
Where was he?

802
01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:24.210
He doesn't remember.
He woke up at the, uh... zoo.

803
01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:26.462
The zoo? Is he rational?

804
01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:29.465
Yes, he is.
He's very excited and confused.

805
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.842
But he's not crazy,
if that's what you mean.

806
01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:36.222
Have you read the papers today?
Or listened to the radio or the television?

807
01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:39.600
- No. Why?
- Is David behaving strangely?

808
01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:46.023
Uh... No, he's not really.

809
01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:49.276
He's rather enthusiastic.

810
01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:53.990
- Could you get here without any trouble?
- Yes, I should think so.

811
01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:57.243
I want you to bring David here
straightaway. I want him in my care.

812
01:14:57.368 --> 01:14:59.120
I'll notify the police that we've found him,

813
01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:02.248
but it's imperative you bring him
straight to the hospital. You understand?

814
01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:03.457
'Yes, Doctor.'

815
01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:05.167
You're certain he's lucid?
You won't need any help?

816
01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:08.838
No, he's fine. We'll come right over.

817
01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:12.466
- Shall I send a car?
- 'A taxi will be faster.'

818
01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:14.593
I expect you shortly.

819
01:15:18.222 --> 01:15:20.725
- We should be able to get a taxi here.
- You know, I should be committed.

820
01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:24.353
Here we are.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.

821
01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:27.648
I don't know why I feel so good.
I haven't felt this good in a long time.

822
01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:31.777
My body feels great. I feel like an athlete!
Let's go back for a quickie, huh?

823
01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:34.613
- Later.
- Oh, come on. Later, okay.

824
01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:37.450
- Good morning!
- Get in.

825
01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:39.076
I just...

826
01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:45.624
- St. Martin's Hospital.
- Right.

827
01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:53.007
Puts you in mind of the days of the old
Demon Barber of Fleet Street, doesn't it?

828
01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:54.967
- Sorry?
- The murders.

829
01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:57.178
- What murders?
- Haven't you heard?

830
01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:02.725
Last night... six of them.

831
01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:06.729
All in different parts of the city,
all mutilated.

832
01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:09.940
He must be a real right maniac,
this fella.

833
01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:13.194
- Pull over. Pull over!
- David, we're going to the...

834
01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:19.033
- Pay the man.
- We must get... Wait!

835
01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:23.370
David!

836
01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:27.291
- David, stop!
- I'm going to the police!

837
01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.794
- Jack was right.
- Jack is dead!

838
01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:31.921
Jack is dead. And six people are dead.

839
01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:34.465
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.
I'm going to the cops.

840
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:37.510
David, please be rational.
Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

841
01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:41.597
Be rational, sure.
I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!

842
01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:43.933
- David!
- Officer!

843
01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:47.561
Officer, I killed those people last night.

844
01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:50.064
- You did, did you?
- He's playing a silly joke...

845
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:51.982
- You be quiet.
- We had an argument.

846
01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:54.735
- I don't know this girl.
- All right, you two. Move along, then.

847
01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:58.072
- Come on, David...
- I want you to arrest me, you asshole!

848
01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:00.199
There's no call for that kind of language.

849
01:17:01.826 --> 01:17:06.455
Queen Elizabeth is a man!
Prince Charles is a faggot!

850
01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:09.750
- Winston Churchill was full of shit!
- That's enough.

851
01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.210
- No! Let go of me!!
- David, please!

852
01:17:11.335 --> 01:17:14.672
Shakespeare's French!
Fuck! Shit! Cunt! Shit!

853
01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:16.590
- Come on. That's enough.
- David, please!

854
01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:19.677
- Who is this person?
- If you don't stop, I shall arrest you.

855
01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:21.595
That's what I want you to do, you moron!

856
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.140
- He's very upset. His friend was killed.
- Will you shut up?

857
01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:26.684
That's quite enough.
About your business, both of you. Come on.

858
01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.562
You're not gonna arrest me?

859
01:17:30.437 --> 01:17:33.065
- Don't you think he should arrest me?
- I don't know.

860
01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:35.192
- Perhaps he thinks it's a prank.
- A prank?

861
01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:37.820
- David...
- I've had enough of this foolishness.

862
01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:39.530
All right, come on.
There's nothing to see.

863
01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:42.533
- It's hopeless. It's hopeless.
- Let's go.

864
01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:45.536
Leave me alone! You people are crazy!

865
01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:48.956
- I gotta get out of here!
- David, don't lose control!

866
01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:50.708
Control? What control?

867
01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.711
Jack was real. He tried to warn me,
and I thought I was crazy.

868
01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:55.504
- David...
- I love you.

869
01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.883
- What?
- I love you.

870
01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:01.927
But I think I did some terrible things
last night, things I can't remember.

871
01:18:02.052 --> 01:18:04.680
- David, let's go and see Dr. Hirsch.
- No, you gotta stay away from me.

872
01:18:04.805 --> 01:18:07.349
- David, I can help you.
- No, I'm not safe to be with.

873
01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:10.394
You gotta stay away from me...
I love you, Alex.

874
01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:18.485
David!

875
01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:24.617
The forensic lab seemed to feel that some
sort of animal was involved, that's true.

876
01:18:24.742 --> 01:18:27.578
- I hardly think it could be...
- Regardless of what you think, Inspector,

877
01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:30.664
the fact remains that David is missing,
and that we must find him.

878
01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:32.333
- Before nightfall.
- Precisely.

879
01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.043
Gentlemen, please.

880
01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:36.921
We shall find Mr. Kessler
as quickly as we're able.

881
01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:40.883
- He tried to get himself arrested.
- Getting arrested isn't all that difficult.

882
01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:43.135
He wants help. He really...

883
01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.429
- How can we assist you?
- Stay here.

884
01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:48.557
If we need you,
we'll know where to reach you.

885
01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:53.646
I cannot accept a connection between
David Kessler and last night's murders.

886
01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:56.941
We will find him, however.
I can assure you of that.

887
01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:59.735
We'll find him. Not to worry.

888
01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:01.904
I promise.

889
01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:19.588
Yes, operator, I'd like to call
the United States and reverse the charges.

890
01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:21.757
David Kessler, for anyone.

891
01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:25.386
Thank you. I'll wait.

892
01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:34.436
Hello? It's area code 516,
472-3402.

893
01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:38.524
402. Thank you.

894
01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:45.990
Hello, Rachel?
Just say yes, you'll accept the charges.

895
01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:47.866
Say yes, Rachel.

896
01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:53.580
Hi. Is Mom or Dad at home?

897
01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.960
Well, where are they?

898
01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:00.296
Well, where's Max?

899
01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:03.382
You're all alone?

900
01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:08.178
Mom and Dad would never
leave me alone when I was 10.

901
01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:10.639
No, not 10-and-a-half, either.

902
01:20:12.099 --> 01:20:16.603
I'm still in London.
Yes, I'm all better now.

903
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.815
Listen, Rachel...

904
01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:24.695
Tell Mom and Dad
that I love them, okay?

905
01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:28.365
Just do it for me, will you, please?

906
01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:31.327
And, uh...

907
01:20:32.703 --> 01:20:34.538
...don't fight with Max.

908
01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:37.041
Yeah, well, try.

909
01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:41.587
And please don't forget
what I told you about Mom and Dad.

910
01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:43.547
That I love them.

911
01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:48.218
And I love Max, and I love you, too.

912
01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:50.137
No, I do.

913
01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:53.474
No, I'm not being silly, you little creep.

914
01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:55.059
You promise?

915
01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:57.353
Okay.

916
01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:01.440
You be a good girl, then.

917
01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:05.110
Yeah, I love you.

918
01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:08.530
Goodbye.

919
01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:05.087
- How much is it?
- £2.80, sir.

920
01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:36.994
Hi, Jack.

921
01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:39.621
Hi, David.

922
01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:52.885
'What are you doing here?

923
01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:55.179
"You promised never to do
this kind of thing again!'

924
01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:58.640
- 'I never promised you any such thing.'
- 'Not you, you twit. Her.'

925
01:22:58.765 --> 01:23:02.895
- 'I've never seen you before in my life.'
-'Oh, sorry.'

926
01:23:09.026 --> 01:23:10.444
Good movie.

927
01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:12.404
Mmm-hmm.

928
01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:16.325
What can I say, Jack?

929
01:23:17.034 --> 01:23:20.120
You don't have to say anything, David.

930
01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:22.247
Aren't you gonna say, "I told you so"?

931
01:23:22.372 --> 01:23:25.125
If I were still alive, I probably would.

932
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.836
But I did tell you so, you schmuck!

933
01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:33.133
- You look awful.
- Thank you.

934
01:23:33.258 --> 01:23:36.386
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

935
01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:38.263
I don't know what I'm saying.

936
01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:41.099
I don't even know if it was me
that killed those people last night.

937
01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:43.060
I don't remember doing it.

938
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:47.314
What about the zoo?

939
01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:50.484
Well, even if I'm not the Wolf Man,

940
01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:53.362
I'm crazy enough
to do something like that.

941
01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:58.951
Look at me. Here I sit in a porno theatre
in Piccadilly Circus, talking to a corpse.

942
01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:02.371
I'm actually glad to see you, Jack.

943
01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:08.210
I want you to meet some people.

944
01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:11.922
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsley.

945
01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:16.635
Gerald's the man you murdered
on the subway.

946
01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:21.098
We thought it best for you not to see him,
as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.

947
01:24:22.599 --> 01:24:25.602
Yes, I do look most unpleasant.

948
01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:27.604
Why are you doing this to me?

949
01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.856
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea.

950
01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:31.608
He's your good friend,

951
01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:36.280
whereas I am a victim
of your carnivorous lunar activities.

952
01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:40.826
Mr. Bringsley, I'm sorry.

953
01:24:41.994 --> 01:24:44.329
I have absolutely no idea
what to say to you.

954
01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:49.126
You've left my wife a widow
and my children fatherless.

955
01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:53.547
And, I understand, I am to walk the Earth
in limbo, one of the living dead,

956
01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:57.718
until the wolf's bloodline is severed
and the curse lifted.

957
01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:04.850
You must die, David Kessler.

958
01:25:07.477 --> 01:25:12.983
David? This is Harry Berman
and his fiancée, Judith Browns.

959
01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:15.485
- Hello.
- Hello.

960
01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:19.948
And these gentlemen
are Alf, Ted and Joseph.

961
01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:22.659
Can't say we're pleased to meet you,
Mr. Kessler.

962
01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:26.079
What shall I do?

963
01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:28.999
- Suicide.
- You must take your own life.

964
01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:31.543
That's easy for you to say,
you're already dead.

965
01:25:31.668 --> 01:25:36.632
No, David. Harry and I and everyone
you murdered are not dead, the undead.

966
01:25:36.757 --> 01:25:39.301
Why are you doing this to me?

967
01:25:39.426 --> 01:25:42.012
Because this must be stopped.

968
01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:45.557
How shall I do it?

969
01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:48.560
- Sleeping pills?
- Not sure enough.

970
01:25:48.685 --> 01:25:51.647
- I could hang myself.
- No.

971
01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:55.984
No, if you did it wrong, it could be painful.
You'd choke to death.

972
01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:59.821
- So what? Let him choke!
- Do you mind? The man's a friend of mine!

973
01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:03.950
- Well, he ain't no friend to me.
- Gentlemen, please.

974
01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:06.787
- A gun!
- I know where you can get a gun.

975
01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:10.916
- Don't I need a silver bullet or something?
- Oh, be serious, would you?

976
01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:13.168
- Madness.
- No, a gun would be good.

977
01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:15.587
Yes. Just put the gun to your forehead
and pull the trigger.

978
01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:18.590
But if you put it in your mouth,
you'd be sure not to miss.

979
01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:22.969
- Thank you. You're all so thoughtful.
- A knife!

980
01:26:23.095 --> 01:26:25.305
- An electric shock!
- A car crash!

981
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:28.141
- You could throw yourself in front of a Tube.
- Drowning.

982
01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:58.839
'Don't stop!'

983
01:27:13.437 --> 01:27:17.691
Go away. Please, go away.

984
01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:24.948
Please, run!

985
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.127
- What was that?
- I don't know!

986
01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:39.087
I'll check on the house.

987
01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:46.762
'Hello? No, I'm sorry.

988
01:27:46.887 --> 01:27:49.973
'No, nobody of that name.
Okay. Thank you. Bye.'

989
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.147
Help! Help!

990
01:27:57.814 --> 01:27:59.441
- Help!
- What's the matter?

991
01:27:59.566 --> 01:28:01.568
- There's a mad thing in there!
- Where?

992
01:28:01.693 --> 01:28:03.945
- A mad dog is tearing...
- Calm down!

993
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:06.573
- Oh, do something!
- Take it slowly!

994
01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:13.914
'Oh, right there. Yeah, right there.

995
01:28:14.039 --> 01:28:17.918
'Oh, yeah, harder. Oh, yeah.'

996
01:28:24.674 --> 01:28:26.426
Jesus Christ.

997
01:28:48.949 --> 01:28:52.160
For Christ's sake, John,
there's a monster in there!

998
01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:55.205
Call for assistance!
Tell them to bring rifles!

999
01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:00.919
Will you people get out of the way?

1000
01:29:30.574 --> 01:29:33.618
- What the hell's going on here?
- Some kind of animal, sir.

1001
01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:27.088
Sister Hobbs said there's a disturbance
in Piccadilly Circus

1002
01:30:27.213 --> 01:30:29.674
- involving some sort of mad dog.
- David!

1003
01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.108
It's a dead end down there!

1004
01:30:54.032 --> 01:30:55.533
Seal this street off!

1005
01:31:26.773 --> 01:31:28.608
David. It's David.

1006
01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:31.111
Alex. Alex!

1007
01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:03.852
- Let me through!
- Stand aside, Miss!

1008
01:32:03.977 --> 01:32:05.770
You must let me through!

1009
01:32:07.814 --> 01:32:10.525
- Come back!
- Alex!

1010
01:32:23.955 --> 01:32:25.165
David?

1011
