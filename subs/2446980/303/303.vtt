00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,429
HENRY:
<i>I’ll be gone in a week.</i>

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:06,680
Your mother’ll miss you.

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,599
‐ Taking her with me, Alan.
‐ What?

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,142
<i>She barely knows
what year it is.</i>

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,019
Take off your shoes.
You know your father

6
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:13,979
won’t abide
any click‐clacks in the house.

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,564
ALAN:
<i>They call it sundownin’.</i>

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,434
<i>Nights are hard for your mom.</i>

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,823
ALAN:
<i>Warden Lacy,</i>

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,202
he told me the Devil was a boy,

11
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,412
and old Dale said he caught him.

12
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,123
<i>Had locked the Devil in a box.</i>

13
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,084
LACY: <i>To put an end to all
the horrors we’ve seen,</i>

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,003
<i>that’s what God told me.</i>

15
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,630
How long ago was this?

16
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,423
ALAN: <i>Don’t let
that fuckin’ kid out.</i>

17
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,175
Is it time to call Pruitt?

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,261
Hey! I can be your lawyer
if you want me to be.

19
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,472
‐ But you have to say it.
‐ ZALEWSKI: <i>We’re both</i>

20
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,667
gettin’ out of this shithole.

21
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,387
( door unlocking )

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,475
( alarms ringing )

23
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,437
‐ Sit the fuck‐‐ ‐ ( gunshot )

24
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,648
( explosion )

25
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,162
WOMAN:
<i>I’m gonna read you</i>

26
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,726
<i>a list of five words.</i>

27
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,833
I’m gonna ask you to repeat them
in any order.

28
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,703
Once now, and then again
in a few minutes.

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,415
You ready?

30
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,219
Boat, family, church,

31
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:30,467
dog, white.

32
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,265
Boat, white, church...

33
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,695
dog...

34
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:38,068
family.

35
00:01:39,873 --> 00:01:42,292
( machine whirring )

36
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,775
( beeping )

37
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:54,656
( machine clacking, vibrating )

38
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,476
( door opens )

39
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:18,359
WOMAN: You okay?

40
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,431
Yeah.

41
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,164
I’m not supposed
to tell you this, but...

42
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,171
your scan looks clear. To me.

43
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,953
Doctor Green will walk through
your results.

44
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,140
So, what is it?

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,667
Do you listen to loud music
in your earbuds?

46
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,625
It could just be tinnitus.

47
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,797
‐ Do you hear it right now?
‐ Comes and goes.

48
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,210
Used to bother me
when I was a teenager.

49
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,178
Where you from?

50
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,804
I know you’re not a Texan.

51
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,681
New Yorker.

52
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,332
Maine.

53
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:58,168
That’s nice.

54
00:02:58,234 --> 00:02:59,895
Flat houses, snow on Christmas.

55
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,313
( chuckles )

56
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,522
Yeah.

57
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,774
Not exactly.

58
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,518
You get back there much?

59
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,853
No.

60
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,532
I guess everyone thinks
they grew up

61
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,847
in the worst place
on earth, huh?

62
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,540
( sirens wail )

63
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,917
MAN: <i>Five days
after the massacre,</i>

64
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,586
<i>we still have so few answers.</i>

65
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,880
<i>Why did the much‐liked
corrections officer</i>

66
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,507
<i>unleash on his fellow guards?</i>

67
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,217
<i>Along with the shocking...</i>
( voice fades )

68
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,718
WOMAN: <i>...privatizing
of the prison,</i>

69
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,720
<i>along with the suicide
of its beloved warden,</i>

70
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,264
<i>the tragedies at Shawshank
keep piling up.</i>

71
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,808
MAN 2:
<i>In other news, the wildfires</i>

72
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,435
<i>continue to spread across
Black Mountain,</i>

73
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,479
<i>engulfing as many as 200 acres.</i>

74
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,940
<i>Firefighting teams from across
the state are pitching in,</i>

75
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,110
<i>but the residents of dozens
of houses between Castle View</i>

76
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,445
<i>and Castle Lake

77
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,067
( sirens wail )

78
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,621
I know. I already had
a hearing scheduled.

79
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,984
They pushed it
three weeks after‐‐

80
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,960
That’s what I’m trying to tell‐‐
Look, look...

81
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,962
I‐I left two messages
with the judge.

82
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,506
I have a client who’s stuck
in Shawshank, and I‐‐

83
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,541
Hello?

84
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,859
‐ Fuck!
‐ ( distant shouting )

85
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:15,280
Sorry, Father.

86
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,181
‐ Thanks for coming down.
‐ Yeah, sorry for the delay.

87
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,641
Um...

88
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,726
I spoke to the cemetery,
they said they should

89
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,061
have a plot for my dad
ready by tomorrow.

90
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,222
That’s not why I called.

91
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,943
( water dripping )

92
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:52,812
It’s called
exploding casket syndrome.

93
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:57,593
Uh, when there’s no oxygen
to dehydrate the... contents,

94
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:01,984
the casket
becomes a pressure cooker.

95
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,270
Wouldn’t think remains this old
would be susceptible, but,

96
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,856
maybe when they resealed
the casket for transport...

97
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,650
‐ ( Henry grunts )
‐ Are you all right?

98
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,027
( muffled explosion )

99
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,522
( muffled gunshot )

100
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,492
( muffled ) Of course, with
the recent trouble at Shawshank,

101
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:22,913
there is a bit of a queue,
if you still want a service.

102
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,791
MAN ( on speaker phone ):
<i>Let me understand this.</i>

103
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,793
<i>You found
the Count of Monte Cristo</i>

104
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,086
<i>in a septic tank.</i>

105
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,172
<i>He asks for his lawyer,

<i>of justice, not one bit,</i>

109
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,390
<i>so he does
the only logical thing</i>

110
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,893
<i>and pumps two clips
into his coworkers.</i>

111
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,438
<i>And voila!
Our very own Times alert.</i>

112
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,900
<i>And yeah, I’d like to take
a moment of silence,</i>

113
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,361
<i>mourn the dead,
be human for a change,</i>

114
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,571
<i>I really would, but I can’t</i>

115
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,533
<i>because I’m so busy
getting fucked in the ass</i>

116
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,285
<i>by your incompetence.</i>

117
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,371
<i>I don’t care if you make him
vanish into thin air</i>

118
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,040
<i>like Harry fuckin’ Houdini,
I don’t care if you bury him</i>

119
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,751
<i>under the yard or buy him
a ticket to Mallorca‐‐</i>

120
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,629
<i>whatever happens in there,
however it gets handled,</i>

121
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:16,281
<i>I knew nothing.
The board knew nothing.</i>

122
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,085
<i>And if things go wrong, Theresa,</i>

123
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,847
<i>there’s always room
under the bus</i>

124
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,140
<i>for one more rogue employee.</i>

125
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,635
<i>( phone disconnects )</i>

126
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,446
<i>( alarm chimes )</i>

127
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,823
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Front door open.</i>

128
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,101
ALAN:
Who the fuck’s that?

129
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,660
HENRY:
New system.

130
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:45,569
So we can keep an eye on Mom.

131
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:48,399
Both doors are rigged.

132
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:50,614
Had to get creative
with the cameras.

133
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:52,574
Four upstairs and four down.

134
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,963
As soon as I’m done
at Shawshank, I’m leaving.

135
00:06:55,117 --> 00:06:56,965
Meantime, we can both
keep an eye on her

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,335
with a smartphone app.

137
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:05,231
Listen, until we figure out
the long‐term situation,

138
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:06,824
I need to know she’s safe.

139
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,811
Why not just put a chip in her,

140
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,671
like a golden retriever?

141
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,100
( phone chimes )

142
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,146
Hello?

143
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,649
Wait, what?

144
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,529
How soon?

145
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,549
NARRATOR: <i>Three challenges will
face you, the newly paroled,</i>

146
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,468
<i>as you reenter society.</i>

147
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,970
<i>What do I do?
Where will I live?</i>

148
00:07:44,453 --> 00:07:47,375
<i>And, finally, who will I be?</i>

149
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,645
<i>The good news is, you can be
almost anyone you want to be</i>

150
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,230
<i>if you adapt
to your new surroundings.</i>

151
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:57,569
<i>You will face questions
about your time in prison.</i>

152
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,070
<i>When you meet
a potential employer,</i>

153
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,405
<i>a potential landlord,
or even a new friend,</i>

154
00:08:02,742 --> 00:08:06,325
<i>don’t be afraid to reframe
your narrative.</i>

155
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,632
<i>The person you were
when you went in,</i>

156
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:11,890
<i>that’s not the person

157
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,804
<i>You can tell your own story,</i>

158
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,419
<i>be your own hero,</i>

159
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,082
<i>choose the life

<i>I’m Lou Hadley, who are you?</i>

( distant siren wails )

163
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,674
Look at that.

164
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,044
Free man.

165
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,006
( chatter, laughter )

166
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,892
There’s a burn
on Black Mountain.

167
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,310
State uses inmates
during fire season.

168
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,664
Why don’t we...

169
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:18,242
Why don’t we start from scratch?

170
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,978
I’m Henry.

171
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:30,085
I’m‐‐ I’m just asking your name.

172
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,036
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

and this is the fashion
thou shalt make it of."

175
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,045
So I built my ark...

00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,140
and when his voice
came into my dreams

177
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,643
for six nights in a row,

178
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:40,234
he told me exactly where
he would stand at the quarry.

179
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:45,007
The reason, the stain,
the curse on our town,

180
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,190
dragging evil behind you
everywhere you went.

181
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,369
And when I brought you
down here,

182
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:58,492
I was on fire
with the Holy Spirit,

183
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,287
righteous, and so strong.

184
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,207
And‐and you looked...

185
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,130
you looked so small
next to my faith.

186
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:21,346
And now...

187
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:24,890
...now you still look small.

188
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,521
But I look old.

189
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,193
I am old.

190
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,289
After all these years,

191
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,914
I still don’t know
what you really are

192
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,899
or if I did the right thing.

193
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,083
Do you remember that crazy story

194
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,912
you told me
your first night in here?

195
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:45,214
Face.

196
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:50,584
No face.

197
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:53,963
Face.

198
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,776
Face.

199
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,038
WOMAN:
<i>Pure retrograde amnesia.</i>

200
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,415
No sign of impairment
to the short‐term memory

201
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,709
or structural damage
to the brain.

202
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,295
A purely emotional phenomenon.

203
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,256
Now I’m going to read you
a list of five words,

204
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,092
I’m going to ask you
to repeat them to me

205
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:16,141
in any order.

206
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:17,373
Ready?

207
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,516
Face, velvet, church,

208
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:23,172
family, red.

209
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:28,879
Face, velvet, red,

210
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,404
church, family.

211
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:34,779
So, uh...

212
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,532
how do you treat it?

213
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,908
There’s no magic bullet.

214
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,702
Sometimes it’s
a gradual process,

215
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,705
other cases, you put someone
back in their own home

216
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,415
with their own junk
and it’s just like

217
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,617
flipping a light switch.

218
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,086
Best medicine’s to get him home.

219
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,540
Restore the context,
restore the memories.

220
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:58,970
But don’t push it.

221
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,888
These things take time.

222
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,923
Oh, no, no.

223
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,434
No, I’m just his lawyer.

224
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,311
I brought him here so you all
could take care of him.

225
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,605
Well, we’re not
an inpatient facility.

226
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,691
I could pull some strings
at Juniper Hill,

227
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,193
might be able to get him
a bed by Monday.

228
00:14:14,344 --> 00:14:15,537
By Monday?

229
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,691
<i>What’s he supposed to do
until Monday?</i>

230
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,452
( whirring )

231
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,329
MOLLY: So the bathroom
is back that way,

232
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,576
there’s no shower,
just don’t drink the water.

233
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,758
HENRY: You should really
stay in here this weekend, OK?

234
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,468
Nobody in town knows you’re out.

235
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:40,666
Let’s keep it that way.

236
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:47,498
I don’t think
this is a good idea.

237
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,148
I appreciate you
trying to help, but...

238
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,983
He needs a place to sleep,

239
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:55,625
and I’ve got one.

240
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,298
Look, we have no idea who he is.

241
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,187
He could be
the Bangor Strangler.

242
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,077
First of all, you made that up.

243
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,931
Second, you’re the one
who got him out of prison.

244
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,183
Yeah, because I believe
in due process.

245
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,018
Doesn’t mean I want him

246
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:30,708
bunking up with my...

247
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,251
friend.

248
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,151
( exhales ) Listen,
I’ll feel a whole lot better

249
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,354
once he’s out of your hair.

250
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,429
And I’m out of this town.

251
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,950
I’m gonna drive him up
to the hospital tomorrow

252
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,105
and check on that wait‐list.

253
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,181
( door opens )

254
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,350

‐ ALARM: <i>Front door open.</i>

255
00:16:09,455 --> 00:16:10,915
( door closes )

256
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,116
Ruth, you shouldn’t
have waited up for me.

257
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,743
Where in God’s name
have you been?

258
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,536
He’s got a fever.
You’re gonna kill him out there.

259
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,659
Ruthie...

260
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,187
Let me take you back to bed.

261
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,164
Everything’s gonna be fine.

262
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:45,280
You’re just having a bad night.

263
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,377
No.

264
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:55,063
Something terrible’s
gonna happen.

00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:39,359
Hello?

352
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,463
( sniffs )

353
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,683
( sighs )

354
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,189
( grunts )

355
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:06,062
The rabbit goes...

356
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:08,370
into the hole.

357
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,915
No, the fox chases the rabbit.

358
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,531
Oh, please.
What’s the difference?

359
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,343
One’s a carnivore,
the other’s breakfast.

360
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:19,715
God, I haven’t had a tie on

361
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,009
since the day
I turned in my badge.

362
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,011
Mm. You’re so sweet.

363
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,931
It’s not sweet
I can’t tie my tie.

364
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,599
‐ It’s arthritis.
‐ ( chuckles )

365
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,804
Oh, the speech.

366
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,562
You tossed and turned all night.
That’s what kept you up.

367
00:24:35,689 --> 00:24:37,733
There’s no shame in it, Alan.

368
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,612
Stage fright’ll jelly up anyone,

369
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,614
even an Adonis like you.

370
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,783
You’ll do fine, you’ll do fine.

371
00:24:46,037 --> 00:24:48,998
‐ Just picture me naked.
‐ ( laughing )

372
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,412
ALAN:
God, I love you.

373
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,211
Uh... ( clears throat )

374
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,514
I, uh, just need to borrow
the car a few hours.

375
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,600
Oh, sure. You can take it
after Alan’s ceremony.

376
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,769
‐ I wasn’t planning on going.
‐ It’s OK, he doesn’t have to.

377
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,514
I wasn’t askin’.

378
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,123
Now, before we get started,

379
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:37,793
please join me in a moment
of silence for our fallen heroes

380
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,163
at Shawshank.

381
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,808
‐ I wanna testify.
‐ ( gunshot )

382
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,428
( ringing )

383
00:25:58,914 --> 00:26:00,858
Thank you.

384
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,052
Well...

385
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,105
Pangborn Bridge.

386
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,007
Get used to the sound of that.

387
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,785
Here’s a man
who has served this county

388
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:14,578
with honor for decades,

389
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:18,375
who saw us through some of
our most challenging times...

390
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,664
who never asked
for anything in return,

391
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:26,428
even when he faced his own
tremendous challenges.

392
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,679
A man who epitomizes
the very soul

393
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,598
of the great town
of Castle Rock.

394
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:35,184
A man that needs
no introduction from me.

395
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,894
Alan Pangborn, everybody.

396
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,139
( audience clapping )

397
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,614
I guess I oughta
thank the wildfire

398
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,200
for smoking you all
out of your houses.

399
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,694
( mild laughter )

400
00:26:53,658 --> 00:26:54,658
Um...

401
00:26:56,693 --> 00:27:00,038
I wanted to be a magician
when I was a kid.

402
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:04,331
They always seemed to have a
lovely assistant hanging around.

403
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,460
But, a magician
has to tell a little story.

404
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:13,294
Something to distract you
while they...

405
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,433
palm an ace off the deck.

406
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,644
I was never any good at that.

407
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,521
Never any good at the patter.

408
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,357
‐ And...
‐ ( dog barking )

409
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,525
( growling, barking )

410
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:26,105
WOMAN: Quiet!

411
00:27:28,242 --> 00:27:30,757
ALAN: If I’ve done any good
in this town...

412
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,574
‐ ( clears throat )
‐ ( dog continues barking )

413
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,743
If I’ve done any good,
it’s because

414
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,781
of the gift of faith
you people have given me.

415
00:27:39,195 --> 00:27:41,296
‐ ( dog barking )
‐ ALAN: Good people.

416
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,333
I just hope I’ve left
Castle County a little better

417
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:47,299
‐ than I found it.
‐ ( dog barking )

418
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,668
Ruth?

419
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:51,919
Ruth!

420
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,264
( dog continues barking )

421
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,299
Mom!

422
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,144
( crowd gasping )

423
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,604
( splashing )

424
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,439
WOMAN:
Oh, no! Somebody help!

425
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,934
( splashing )

426
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,613
( siren wails )

427
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,150
( bell rings )

428
00:28:14,602 --> 00:28:15,985
Hey.

429
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,279
I’m back.

430
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,373
Hello?

431
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,711
( sirens wail in distance )

432
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,089
( sirens continue )

433
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,011
Hey, I don’t know where you are,
but I thought I should tell you,

434
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,255
the kid, um, wandered off.

435
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,780
So, call me when you get this.

436
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,897
JACKIE: Okay, so then
the next‐door neighbors

437
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,857
got gassed in their house.

438
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,695
Just a freak accident,
supposedly.

439
00:29:31,913 --> 00:29:35,340
Cracked furnace case.
They all died in their sleep

440
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,950
on Christmas Eve.
Shit you not.

441
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,611
( music playing )

442
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,282
Lined up the body bags
right on the lawn.

443
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,583
Plus the dog and cat.

444
00:29:47,023 --> 00:29:48,734
This is before I was born.

445
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:51,299
Just like everything interesting
that’s ever happened here.

446
00:29:56,773 --> 00:29:58,678
I mean, they say
write what you know,

447
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,639
but this town is so blah.

448
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:03,433
I mean, people bitch
about the bad old days

449
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,227
when there were, like,
serial killers

450
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:09,546
and psychopathic dogs,
but I would give my left tit

451
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,109
to go back there.

452
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,603
The eighties, man.

453
00:30:18,768 --> 00:30:20,353
I had this uncle, though.

454
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,787
He was a writer, too.

455
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,872
And then, one winter,
he just flipped his lid

456
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,874
and tried to ax‐murder
his wife and kid

457
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,421
at some fancy ski resort.

458
00:30:30,065 --> 00:30:31,968
And my folks will never
talk to me about it.

459
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:35,773
So I took his name
just to piss them off.

460
00:30:36,421 --> 00:30:38,468
My real name’s Diane.

461
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,262
WOMAN:
<i>We have breaking news.</i>

462
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,305
<i>Less than an hour ago,
a firefighting helicopter</i>

463
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,017
<i>exploded near Castle Lake,
killing the pilot</i>

464
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,977
<i>and two firefighters onboard.</i>

465
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,895
‐ <i>They were attempting...</i>
<i>‐</i> JACKIE: This fucking lighter.

466
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,272
<i>...that originated
on Black Mountain</i>

467
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,982
<i>with flame retardant
when the pilot</i>

468
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,525
<i>apparently lost control
of the aircraft.</i>

469
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,318
( Jackie speaks indistinctly )

470
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,612
<i>This tragedy means
five people have now died</i>

471
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,656
<i>as a result
of these powerful fires.</i>

472
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,742
<i>Multiple others
are at County Hospital</i>

473
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,744
<i>being treated for burns,
many of whom</i>

474
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,155
<i>are in critical condition.</i>

475
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:20,156
It was all they had left
in the machine.

476
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:23,127
( grunts )

477
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,305
She’s usually OK
in the mornings.

478
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,269
( sighs )

479
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,742
I bought her a ring in ’91.

480
00:31:41,931 --> 00:31:45,906
She said it’d be confusing
to her boy.

481
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,484
And she didn’t deserve it.

482
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:52,371
Happiness.

483
00:31:55,095 --> 00:31:57,640
Eventually I quit asking
and moved south.

484
00:31:58,197 --> 00:32:00,366
( clears throat )
Live free or die.

485
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,296
By the time I moved back,
I figured we’d missed our shot.

486
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:09,648
I was an old fuck anyway.

487
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,046
Then I get a phone call.

488
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:18,289
Somebody heard gunfire up
at your mom’s place.

489
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,280
I wasn’t sheriff, but folks
still rang me up time to time.

490
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,483
Gunfire?

491
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,368
What happened?

492
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,328
Your mother came to the door

493
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,734
looking like she’d been
to hell and back,

494
00:32:31,468 --> 00:32:32,916
threw her arms around me,

495
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,078
begged me, "Don’t leave."

496
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,456
( exhales )

497
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:46,312
I thought I could keep her safe.

498
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:52,777
She’s awake.

499
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,367
( knocking )

500
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,359
Oh.

501
00:33:07,454 --> 00:33:09,164
You gotta get back to them.

502
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,507
The naming.

503
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:14,791
I ruined the party.

504
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,459
ALAN: No, you didn’t.

505
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,080
You didn’t ruin anything.

506
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,803
It was the damn dog.

507
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:39,148
Nothing stays dead in this town.

508
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,937
( sighs )

509
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:48,068
It’s like I opened the book
and all the pictures...

510
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,435
someone tore them out.

511
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,555
Rearranged them.

512
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:17,905
You know how it feels,
don’t you?

513
00:34:19,697 --> 00:34:21,074
To forget your own story.

514
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,407
( brakes squeal )

515
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,878
I don’t know what happened.

516
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,296
We were just shooting the shit.

517
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,331
Where is he?

518
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,382
<i>‐ ( couple screaming )
‐ ( dog barking )</i>

519
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,434
<i>‐ ( baby crying )
‐ ( car strikes object )</i>

520
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:12,233
<i>‐ ( mysterious whispering )
‐ ( woman moaning )</i>

521
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,370
ZALEWSKI: <i>We’re both
getting out...</i>

522
00:35:15,421 --> 00:35:18,090
<i>Make a fist
and bump it against mine.</i>

523
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,438
MOLLY: I didn’t know
where you went.

524
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,102
I was‐‐ I was worried about you.

525
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:29,493
<i>‐ ( dog barking )
‐ ( woman screaming )</i>

526
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,942
SHAWSHANK PRISONER:
I shouldn’t be here.

527
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,803
I should still be in the hole.

528
00:35:40,383 --> 00:35:43,023
No, listen to me.

529
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:46,985
Warden Lacy was just
a sick old man.

530
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:49,539
Whatever he said to you,

531
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:52,021
it wasn’t true.

532
00:35:52,257 --> 00:35:55,410
<i>‐ ( panicked shouting )
‐ ( flames erupting )</i>

533
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,996
<i>‐ ( gunshot )
‐ ( indistinct speaking )</i>

534
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,414
LACY:
<i>...the stain.</i>

535
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,042
‐ You’re just a kid.
‐ <i>( screaming )</i>

536
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,412
<i>‐ ( baby crying )
‐ ( people screaming )</i>

537
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,475
‐ MARET: <i>You okay?</i>
‐ HENRY Yeah. Just...

538
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,429
I want Wendell to be able
to remember her when she’s gone,

539
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,351
and I don’t know how much longer

540
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,770
she’ll be able to recognize him.

541
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,730
<i>I guess he could
take a bus up there.</i>

542
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,226
I really appreciate it, Maret.

543
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,196
‐ ( beeps ) ‐ <i>Front door open.</i>

544
00:36:50,937 --> 00:36:52,148
MOLLY:
Henry.

545
00:36:57,991 --> 00:36:58,991
Molly.

546
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:04,456
I tried calling you.

547
00:37:04,492 --> 00:37:05,820
I’m sorry, my phone is‐‐

548
00:37:06,842 --> 00:37:09,010
( sighs )
It’s a long story.

549
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,171
How did you get in?

550
00:37:13,006 --> 00:37:15,384
There’s a key under the frog.

551
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:22,460
So I found him on top
of the old shirt factory...

552
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,625
on, you know, I thought
he was gonna jump.

553
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,660
Whew.

554
00:37:28,078 --> 00:37:29,045
Had to give him an Oxy

555
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,714
just to get him in the car.

556
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,625
He’s still in there.
He’s sleeping it off.

557
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,674
He feels wrong.

558
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:44,640
Well, thank you
for getting him settled down.

559
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,855
I think maybe we just need
to get some rest, and‐‐

560
00:37:47,171 --> 00:37:50,340
OK. Um, so I’m not
explaining it right. Um...

561
00:38:00,517 --> 00:38:04,202
Everyone broadcasts
at their own frequency.

562
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:09,294
Sometimes it’s deafening,
you know, like with you.

563
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:13,298
Sometimes it’s so faint
I can barely hear it.

564
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,920
But after years of this,
I’ve heard it all.

565
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,390
With him, it’s just‐‐

566
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,185
it’s like I was listening
to the pain of everyone

567
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,679
in this town all at once.

568
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,599
OK.

569
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,741
‐ ( sighs )
‐ Oh, you don’t believe me.

570
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,284
No, no, no, I do. I do.

571
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,154
I just...

572
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,116
Look, I don’t know
what to say to that.

573
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,460
Your right ear is ringing.

574
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,656
So loud you can barely
hear yourself think.

575
00:38:58,173 --> 00:39:01,053
You feel guilty about
the clients you couldn’t save,

576
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,306
about those dead prison guards,

577
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,757
about your mom, and your father,

578
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:07,962
and <i>your</i> son,
who barely has a father.

579
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:12,678
And you haven’t eaten yet today.

580
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,359
I’m telling you,

581
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,035
there is something wrong
with that kid.

582
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,322
‐ ( door opens )
‐ <i>Front door open.</i>

583
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,593
Maybe you should
stay here tonight.

584
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,718
Hmm?

585
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:44,971
Come on.

586
00:40:38,738 --> 00:40:40,812
HENRY: My dad spent
a lot of time out here.

587
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:46,140
It’s not the Ritz,
but it has a pull‐out.

588
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,579
At least it used to.

589
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,273
Make yourself at home.

590
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,167
Now...

591
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,843
you need anything...

592
00:41:49,514 --> 00:41:50,898
you just cross the yard.

593
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,310
( plays single note )

594
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,113
( plays simple melody )

595
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:22,373
( plays classical cadence )

596
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,174
( continues playing )

597
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,886
You play piano.

598
00:42:39,585 --> 00:42:41,460
Huh. That’s somethin’.

599
00:42:42,421 --> 00:42:43,984
SHAWSHANK PRISONER:
I remember.

600
00:42:48,876 --> 00:42:51,170
It’ll all come back to you
before you know it.

601
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,389
( Alan grunts )

602
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:15,785
A fuckin’ bridge.

603
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,394
( splashes )

604
00:43:30,617 --> 00:43:33,910
RUTH: <i>Well, I may be half
bombed, but I coulda sworn...</i>

605
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,788
ALAN: <i>You’re still
the smartest person I know.</i>

606
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,081
<i>( Ruth and Alan laughing )</i>

607
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,201
<i>( phone buzzing )</i>

608
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,371
ALAN:
Hey, asshole.

609
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,262
Do you know who I am?

610
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,811
Don’t look at me like that,
fucker. You know me.

611
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,875
You remember.

612
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,066
( siren bleating )

613
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:59,194
<i>That’s right. Lacy.</i>

614
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,640
<i>I pulled him over
in the middle of the night.</i>

615
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,086
( banging, muffled shouting )

616
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:11,424
<i>Wear a badge long enough
in this fuckin’ county,</i>

617
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,551
<i>guy with the Devil
in his Lincoln</i>

618
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:16,262
<i>doesn’t sound half
bug‐shit crazy.</i>

619
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:19,286
He asked me to trust him.

620
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,678
God help me, I did.

621
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,439
I used to dream about you.

622
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:30,526
I can’t remember
my own dead wife’s face,

623
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,695
but I <i>never</i> forgot yours.

624
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,250
Not for 27 fucking years.

625
00:45:42,924 --> 00:45:44,936
Don’t think I didn’t wonder.

626
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,396
<i>Should I let a monster drive
off with a boy in his trunk?</i>

627
00:45:50,432 --> 00:45:52,142
( muffled shouting )

628
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,012
( banging on trunk from inside )

629
00:45:58,695 --> 00:46:00,851
Now I’m an old man,

630
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,234
and you haven’t aged
one goddamn day.

631
00:46:10,296 --> 00:46:11,476
Are you the Devil?

632
00:46:16,156 --> 00:46:17,156
No.

633
00:46:17,592 --> 00:46:19,523
Then what the fuck are you?!

634
00:46:21,174 --> 00:46:22,932
<i>I tried my best.</i>

635
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,664
( clatter )

636
00:46:24,832 --> 00:46:27,351
<i>I tried to keep
the people of this town safe.</i>

637
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,023
<i>Where’s it land you?</i>

638
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:35,015
You wait 30 years
for the woman you love

639
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:37,851
and finally you get her,

640
00:46:38,822 --> 00:46:41,078
and she slips through
your fingers.

641
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:47,804
And here you are,
fuckin’ Rip Van Winkle.

642
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,875
Where’s the justice in that?

643
00:46:55,874 --> 00:46:56,882
( cocks pistol )

644
00:46:56,918 --> 00:46:58,968
I asked you a fuckin’ question.

645
00:47:04,886 --> 00:47:06,242
I can help her.

646
00:47:15,222 --> 00:47:17,562
You have no idea
what’s happening here, do you?

647
