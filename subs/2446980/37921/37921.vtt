00:00:00,032 --> 00:00:02,070
<i>Previously on Pure...</i>

2
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:05,098
I had to tell Voss
that I would take Gerry's place.

3
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:07,091
<i>God wants me to submit to His plan.</i>

4
00:00:07,117 --> 00:00:10,177
Please give your old phone
to Joey. Take a new one.

5
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:12,784
<i>So I can meet everyone
in Voss's business</i>

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,558
<i>and write down their names
and their crimes,</i>

7
00:00:15,584 --> 00:00:18,204
and then I can destroy
this whole satanic mob.

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,785
"Epp, Jeremias."

9
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,043
The arrest report says
that you seized his phone.

10
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,725
Why isn't it on the evidence list?

11
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:25,730
<i>You realize that if that phone is lost,</i>

12
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:29,731
his lawyers will argue that all the
evidence in this case is inadmissible.

13
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:31,372
Show me where the money is counted.

14
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,523
If I bring you into this,
how do I keep you safe?

15
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:37,208
If you don't, how do I keep you safe?

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,598
<i>On your knees!</i>

17
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:10,108
What do you say we stick
to the original deal?

18
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:11,725
Sound like a plan?

19
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:21,569
Holy shit.

20
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:42,985
God.

21
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:20,790
No. We gotta clean this up.

22
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:22,844
But this is murder.

23
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:25,255
If the cops find out,

24
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,424
then Voss finds out
and then we're screwed. Alright?

25
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:33,797
Did you know about this?

26
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:35,766
Did you know this was the plan, Noah?!

27
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:39,570
Chad told me he would help with
Mr. Crowbar, but he didn't say how.

28
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:42,714
Alright, alright. We need
to hide these bodies,

29
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,490
- OK? Abel, look at me.
- Yeah, yeah.

30
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:47,467
No one finds out about this! No one!

31
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,452
What the hell is he doing?
Are you praying?

32
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:51,595
We don't have time to pray!
We need to clean this shit up!

33
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,338
Abel, get in that house right now

34
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:55,476
and find something we can put
these bodies in! Go!

35
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,552
Tina?

36
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:33,071
Tinky?

37
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:40,587
Tina?

38
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:49,745
Noah.

39
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:00,150
<i>Why do we all need to go?</i>

40
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:03,030
Because Wilma is sick and
Walter is hopeless on his own.

41
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:06,071
Go across the fields,
it's quicker that way.

42
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:08,903
And if you're back before 6, I'll know
you didn't do enough to help.

43
00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:13,713
You're pastor's children now. Go!

44
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:20,804
She's trying to get rid of us.

45
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:24,435
You spend too much time
pretending to know things you don't.

46
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:28,772
Just be glad you're so clueless.

47
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:32,253
He's seen more than any of us
and he doesn't say a thing.

48
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:53,223
<i>Gott im Himmel!</i>

49
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:56,391
Bronco!

50
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:58,693
I did nothing.

51
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:01,069
It was Chad and his pals.
The help you called in.

52
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,697
We just have to hide them for a while

53
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,679
until we can figure out
what we're gonna do.

54
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:10,186
Are the children gone?

55
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:11,997
Yes...

56
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,702
The woodpile. Abel, hurry!

57
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:15,813
Hurry!

58
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:18,293
We're gonna need clean clothes.

59
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,836
<i>Jo. Those bodies can't stay here.</i>

60
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:24,731
Yeah, we're gonna stash 'em
until we come up with a plan. Lift!

61
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:33,328
You know, it is your plan
that got us into this mess.

62
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:36,494
Going undercover was your idea,

63
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,969
and going behind their back
was your wife's idea.

64
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:41,429
- You are an evil, stupid man.
- Yeah.

65
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:43,741
<i>Brooda! Help me with this.</i>

66
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,672
Alright.

67
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,683
You got the Demons in play.

68
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:57,336
Voss has got his cash, so we can let
off the heat a little bit, right?

69
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,449
OK? We just need to figure out...

70
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:03,649
to dispose of these bodies
and then figure out a way

71
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:06,151
to get Voss talking business
on the wire.

72
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:07,984
First of all,

73
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:11,666
we do not just "dispose" of the bodies
like they're pigs in a slaughterhouse.

74
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:14,459
These men are standing
before God right now,

75
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:17,153
being judged for their sins,
as we will all be judged!

76
00:06:17,726 --> 00:06:19,489
How are we going
to get Eli Voss up here?

77
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,847
- Football player?
- You tell him the truth.

78
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:24,572
You tell him that killing the Janzens

79
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:27,463
scared our drivers, and the only way

80
00:06:27,498 --> 00:06:29,908
that he can get the cash
is if he comes here in person.

81
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,817
- What?!
- No one

82
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,848
calls Eli Voss.
If he wants to talk, he calls.

83
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,275
And he doesn't just come get the money

84
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,444
like a truck coming to get
the milk. We send it.

85
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:43,007
On time or else.

86
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:45,168
So we come up with another idea, OK?

87
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:47,776
I got a friend in the DEA.

88
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,833
We work with her, and we can
throw a giant net over Eli Voss.

89
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:54,652
The Drug Enforcement Agency,
why them? Why not your own boss?

90
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:57,012
I have some concerns, you know?

91
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:58,601
Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I think.

92
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,214
Voss might have somebody working
on the inside of my shop.

93
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,252
- Among the police?
- Yeah. Maybe. No, I don't know.

94
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:12,642
So you have no help.

95
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,685
It's just you and me

96
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:21,492
against Eli Voss and his entire mob?

97
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:25,390
And also your brother Abel.

98
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,318
There's a hose in the milking barn.

99
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:35,258
Go clean yourself up. We'll finish here.

100
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:28,190
Maybe we shouldn't either.

101
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,115
We put it in the milk!

102
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:37,070
We tell Voss, new idea.

103
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:40,364
We suspend the coke inside
a container-load of milk,

104
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:44,092
ship it across the border
then bake it back to its crystal form.

105
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:50,422
Every time Voss tries to move
a shipment, the DEA is all over him.

106
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:53,452
Trust me. He needs a new way
to move his product.

107
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:54,495
We are farmers.

108
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:57,381
Not scientists. We don't know
how to do such things.

109
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:59,939
You don't have to. I have
a guy that will take care of it.

110
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:02,859
You just make sure that Voss comes north

111
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:06,278
- and sees the process for himself.
- Nobody phones Eli Voss.

112
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:10,027
- Nobody tells him to do anything.
- Well, somebody does.

113
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,388
Voss has to have eyes and ears

114
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:14,701
<i>in the Auslander world
that has a direct line back to him.</i>

115
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:16,483
We find that person,

116
00:10:16,664 --> 00:10:18,623
and we get them to send our message.

117
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:20,804
You understand?

118
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:24,040
What about the bodies?

119
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,851
I will take care of that, OK?

120
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:30,006
Um, thank you for the clothes.

121
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,041
And, the ones

122
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:34,717
- with the blood on them...
- I will burn them.

123
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:36,206
Good.

124
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:53,546
Yeah?

125
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:55,573
<i>Hey, Doc, it's Bronco.
I'll be right over.</i>

126
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:57,009
<i>I got some homework for you.</i>

127
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:09,439
<i>- You got the money?
- Jo.</i>

128
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:11,106
All of it?

129
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,933
I'm number two.
I should have been in on this.

130
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,436
Did you find a driver yet?

131
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:26,367
No. He heard about the Janzens
and got spooked.

132
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:27,972
How did you get the Demons to back off?

133
00:11:27,998 --> 00:11:30,166
You had one job, Joey: Find a driver.

134
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:32,477
If this doesn't get to Voss,
we are all in trouble.

135
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,604
Now, can we trust you

136
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:36,421
to do this one thing or
do we have to find someone else?

137
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,432
<i>Nee. Nee, I'll work on it.</i>

138
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:41,878
<i>If not, someone will have to call Onkel</i>

139
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:43,912
- and explain the delay.
- I said, I'll work on it.

140
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,450
<i>- Besides, no one calls Onkel.
- Someone does.</i>

141
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,583
<i>Someone who knows the Auslanders.
Maybe your brother?</i>

142
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,366
There's one person.
Gerry knows, but he won't say.

143
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:57,428
Find a driver.

144
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:00,153
Do something about those bodies.

145
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:01,266
They're getting ripe.

146
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:07,273
You have to talk to Gerry.

147
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:21,930
<i>Hey, I finished your paperwork.</i>

148
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,029
You're welcome. Still no sign
of Gerry Epp's phone.

149
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:27,871
Kingsley had me rewrite
a chronology of the whole thing.

150
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:30,496
That was my bust.
Why won't she come to me?

151
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:32,053
I don't know. 'Cause you weren't here?

152
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:35,110
- Hard copy's on the desk.
- What does it say?

153
00:12:35,597 --> 00:12:38,836
"Bronco screwed up.
It's not my fault. Love, Jay"?

154
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:42,536
Hey, the phone's a crucial
piece of evidence that you lost, not me.

155
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:46,157
Not that a judge is gonna care,
'cause if this case gets tossed,

156
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:48,479
- the shit lands on all of us.
- Especially me.

157
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:52,203
I didn't lose the phone, Jay,
OK? Somebody lost it for me.

158
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:53,959
Whatever you say, man.

159
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,899
Goddammit!

160
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:11,787
I forgot to bring in the wood.

161
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:15,570
I'll get it! Sit! Sit!

162
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:29,636
I have decided

163
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,615
the funeral will be on Friday

164
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:34,665
for the men in the airplane.

165
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:39,299
Do drug dealers deserve a funeral?

166
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:41,497
They were men with families,

167
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,307
men with souls.

168
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,375
They deserve at least that.

169
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:52,518
I will see Peter Wiebe
tomorrow about coffins.

170
00:14:01,516 --> 00:14:02,835
Being pastor

171
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:05,649
has brought many new responsibilities,

172
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:09,448
and I am blessed to have
a family so willing to help.

173
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:31,781
Do you want me to call you back?

174
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:46,312
Chief, you got a sec?

175
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:50,138
- Yeah. What's going on?
- Gerry Epp's phone,

176
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:53,108
wasn't lost or misplaced.

177
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:56,051
Someone made it disappear
because they were worried

178
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:58,329
that their name might appear
on the contact list.

179
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:00,431
And I believe that "someone"

180
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:02,037
is here in this department.

181
00:16:03,437 --> 00:16:04,462
Ahem!

182
00:16:05,718 --> 00:16:07,420
I found that in Jay's desk.

183
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:16,360
Detective Novak, this is
a very serious allegation.

184
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,704
Yeah, I know.

185
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:21,099
I mean, I can't believe it either.

186
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,342
He's like a brother to me.

187
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,642
Alright. Leave it with me.

188
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:27,669
OK.

189
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:50,064
You OK?

190
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:54,654
It just gets weirder and weirder.

191
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,657
Tell me about it.

192
00:16:58,749 --> 00:16:59,835
You wanna talk?

193
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:03,292
Somewhere that's not school?

194
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:18,328
<i>Voda doesn't like me
wasting time this way.</i>

195
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:20,722
He says it's prideful.

196
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:23,815
You must have sketches too.

197
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:26,442
A few. Not like this.

198
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:28,759
Mostly tagging ideas.

199
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,380
Can I see?

200
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:33,332
I showed you mine.

201
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,791
I keep my sketches in my room
so my dad doesn't realize

202
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:39,786
who's been tagging
the walls all over town.

203
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:43,907
Bring your sketches.

204
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:51,725
One sec.

205
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:41,555
I-I saw it through the doorway...

206
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:43,549
Your drug-dealing parents
send you to scoop

207
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:46,677
whatever evidence my sad excuse
for a dad may have found.

208
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:48,619
No. It's not like that.

209
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:49,895
So there's nothing in your bag?

210
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:52,584
You know what?

211
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:55,515
Take it. I don't care.

212
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:58,378
Ben, please, you don't understand.

213
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:01,467
Just go.

214
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,241
Please tell me you didn't park
the buggy up front.

215
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:11,163
Snowflake is tied up in the park.

216
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:13,518
"Snowflake," I love it!

217
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:15,465
This is the guy I was telling
you about. Doctor. Pastor.

218
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,015
Pastor. Doctor.

219
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:20,691
- You bring the stuff?
- Yeah.

220
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:23,899
The good doctor sacrificed

221
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:26,232
a gram of his own stash
for a little trial run.

222
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,785
And it cooked back up like
the crust of a crème brûlée.

223
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,236
So, we are gonna have to scale this
up in order to impress Eli Voss.

224
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:34,514
So here's the plan.

225
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:36,846
When Voss gets wind
that his merchandise can be

226
00:19:36,872 --> 00:19:38,955
moved in a milk truck,
he's gonna want to see it.

227
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:40,766
So he comes back up into Canada,

228
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:44,129
you engage in some high-tech,
milk-smuggling banter

229
00:19:44,155 --> 00:19:47,745
on the wire, and hello, judge
and jury, we got him in the bag.

230
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:51,216
Voss knows I don't want to
help him. He'll be suspicious.

231
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:53,954
Well, you just tell him you're
doing it to buy back your freedom,

232
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,512
and he'll believe that you're dumb enough
to bargain with him, which you are.

233
00:19:57,688 --> 00:19:58,688
Trust me,

234
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,103
Voss needs this. We have the message;

235
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:02,917
We just need the messenger.

236
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:19,705
Joey tells me Anna

237
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:22,133
pushed her way into my business.

238
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,288
I knew you were weak,

239
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:27,299
- but that is truly pathetic.
- I need to speak to your uncle.

240
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:29,512
I know you don't know how to reach him,

241
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:31,368
but Joey says you know someone who does.

242
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,551
<i>There is one. An Auslander.</i>

243
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:43,964
Voss' connection to every major dealer
this side of the border.

244
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:47,305
If you give me the name,
I will double your family's allowance.

245
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,676
You must really be in a tight spot

246
00:20:55,383 --> 00:20:57,617
to come here begging for my help.

247
00:20:57,848 --> 00:21:01,194
- It's an emergency.
- Out of options?

248
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:03,598
The lives of your brother,

249
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:05,545
your wife and children

250
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:07,159
hanging by a thread?

251
00:21:29,877 --> 00:21:31,578
You son of a bitch!

252
00:21:32,103 --> 00:21:35,005
Hey! Hey! Hey!

253
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,895
Sarge, hey!

254
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:40,419
You bastard! Come here!

255
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:45,592
- Stop it! Stop it!
- You're finished, Novak!

256
00:21:45,626 --> 00:21:46,953
You hear me? You're done!

257
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:48,752
I'm not the one who
made the phone disappear!

258
00:21:48,778 --> 00:21:50,730
Yeah, I found
the evidence bag in your desk!

259
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:52,682
Because you put it there, you loser!

260
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,672
You're pathetic, Novak.
I'm done with you, man.

261
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,606
All the charges against the Mennonites

262
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,480
have been dropped because
of your incompetence, Novak.

263
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:04,177
Not his, yours!

264
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:06,646
So if you can still find

265
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:08,579
your own badge, I want it on my desk.

266
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,896
He said the lives of your children
are hanging by a thread?

267
00:22:22,478 --> 00:22:24,849
<i>Jo,but he doesn't mean that.</i>

268
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,159
<i>Yes, he does, Brooda.</i>

269
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:28,349
I know him.

270
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:31,371
<i>We need to find the name
of the Auslander</i>

271
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:33,188
who can get our message to Voss.

272
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,605
You'll never get that from Gerry Epp.

273
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:42,449
<i>Imagine how trotzich he would be</i>

274
00:22:42,483 --> 00:22:44,695
if it were
his children's lives in danger.

275
00:22:47,692 --> 00:22:48,958
What are you suggesting?

276
00:22:49,657 --> 00:22:51,624
You wouldn't hurt them

277
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,827
<i>- of course.
- Nee. Nee, nee, nee.</i>

278
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,911
Just take them on an outing somewhere.

279
00:22:57,617 --> 00:22:59,472
When they don't come home from school,

280
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,501
Justina picks up the phone,
calls Gerry and..

281
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:05,901
<i>They know you a little from when you used
to buy the drugs from their Voda, jo?</i>

282
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:09,280
They are just boys.

283
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,369
Everyone who mucks out the
barn gets a little dirty, Abel.

284
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,740
Joey, I need to borrow the truck.

285
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:21,051
What?

286
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:22,969
Why?

287
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:26,324
<i>- You can't drive.
- Jo.</i>

288
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:28,902
How different can it be from a tractor?

289
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:31,898
<i>Besides, I am the Bauss,</i>

290
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:33,551
and I need the truck.

291
00:24:13,158 --> 00:24:14,692
Jesus Christ.

292
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:17,276
Ben!

293
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,286
- Novak.
- It's working!

294
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:29,556
I keep retesting because I can't
believe the numbers I'm getting.

295
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,792
Will you write it down?

296
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:34,122
Right.

297
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,951
Shit! Now, I have to do it all again.

298
00:24:37,357 --> 00:24:40,700
<i>Anyway, don't ask me how...
maybe it's the acids in the milk</i>

299
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:43,269
<i>neutralizing the alkaloids
in the coke... but this shit</i>

300
00:24:43,304 --> 00:24:46,365
is now 98.5% pure.

301
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,321
Off the charts!

302
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:53,609
And the driver is certain
he saw them get off the bus?

303
00:24:54,823 --> 00:24:56,850
But that was over two hours ago

304
00:24:56,884 --> 00:24:58,885
and we all look the same to you anyway.

305
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,570
I want to speak to the driver myself.

306
00:25:10,145 --> 00:25:11,991
What are you doing with Joey's truck?

307
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:13,992
Your boys are fine

308
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:18,104
as long as Gerry gives me
what I want. So you call him,

309
00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:21,274
explain the situation
and then you ask him,

310
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:24,125
"Whose life is hanging by a thread now?"

311
00:26:36,016 --> 00:26:38,284
Two coffins. As you ordered.

312
00:26:39,002 --> 00:26:41,237
I'm afraid I have to ask for two more.

313
00:26:41,905 --> 00:26:45,460
Best not to ask why. Just make them.

314
00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:46,535
<i>Bitte.</i>

315
00:26:47,595 --> 00:26:49,729
I know. I know.

316
00:26:49,763 --> 00:26:51,541
It's not how I said it would be.

317
00:26:52,086 --> 00:26:54,077
But we have to have faith in God,

318
00:26:54,268 --> 00:26:56,717
and trust that we are
following His will.

319
00:26:57,226 --> 00:26:59,751
And I say, follow it where?

320
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,186
<i>Jo?</i>

321
00:27:29,303 --> 00:27:31,600
So I heard from my wife.

322
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:34,225
<i>So now you give me what I want.</i>

323
00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:36,584
Or what?

324
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,178
Or something bad will happen.

325
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,748
Naw, you keep 'em.

326
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:44,696
<i>- What?
- How long have we known each other?</i>

327
00:27:44,785 --> 00:27:46,619
<i>When we were kinder,
you couldn't even put</i>

328
00:27:46,654 --> 00:27:48,621
a worm on a hook.
How could you hurt my boys?

329
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:52,179
<i>Also, Justina needs a break so keep 'em.</i>

330
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,438
<i>- Your children?
- And by the way,</i>

331
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:56,245
they're dropping the charges.

332
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,498
See what happens
when you go to outsiders?

333
00:27:59,073 --> 00:28:02,268
<i>I'm coming back, Noah Funk,
and when I do,</i>

334
00:28:02,303 --> 00:28:04,932
I will hurt you in every way I know how.

335
00:28:15,282 --> 00:28:17,190
It is strange to see you driving.

336
00:28:18,695 --> 00:28:20,553
Why should it be any more strange

337
00:28:20,587 --> 00:28:23,062
than seeing me hide bodies
or kidnap children

338
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:24,244
or smuggle drug money?

339
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,269
It did not go well?

340
00:28:37,074 --> 00:28:40,176
Does Abel know?

341
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:43,209
You should call him. And Bronco.

342
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:50,660
I know it's hard for you
to have him involved in our affairs.

343
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,848
I saved you from him a long time ago.

344
00:28:56,183 --> 00:28:57,559
I saved you

345
00:28:57,873 --> 00:28:59,841
<i>from an Auslander life.</i>

346
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:01,777
And now look at us.

347
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,584
Maybe you would have been better off.

348
00:29:08,138 --> 00:29:09,238
Stop.

349
00:29:12,145 --> 00:29:13,306
I love you.

350
00:29:15,304 --> 00:29:16,688
I love our children.

351
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:19,300
I love our life together.

352
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,617
Good and bad.

353
00:29:32,883 --> 00:29:34,984
We should probably get those inside.

354
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:36,731
<i>Jo.</i>

355
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:53,946
Stop, it's my turn.

356
00:29:57,218 --> 00:30:00,087
Let me try!

357
00:30:00,187 --> 00:30:02,653
- Stop!
- Hey, hey!

358
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,426
I'm kind of busy back here
trying to save your brother's life!

359
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,061
- It's my turn!
- Do not destroy the place!

360
00:30:09,096 --> 00:30:12,665
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

361
00:31:05,953 --> 00:31:07,730
Stop it! It's my turn!

362
00:31:09,474 --> 00:31:10,474
Yeah?

363
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,238
You're joking.

364
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:17,842
<i>Na oba.</i>

365
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,687
How do we get our message to Voss?

366
00:31:24,872 --> 00:31:26,084
You know best.

367
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:31,496
OK, boys. It's time to go!

368
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:52,071
What happened to you?

369
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:54,347
I was expecting a call.

370
00:31:55,787 --> 00:31:57,419
Have you got the formula for the,

371
00:31:57,445 --> 00:31:59,794
the, the cocaine process?

372
00:32:00,223 --> 00:32:01,809
As a matter of fact, I do.

373
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,121
Do you have the number for Voss?

374
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,511
I have another plan.

375
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:08,756
We can solve our woodpile problem,

376
00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:11,791
our money-delivery problem and
our message problem all at once.

377
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,995
Look at you, Lex Lutheran.
Criminal mastermind.

378
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,975
<i>Nee. I am not like them.
I am a man of God.</i>

379
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,987
I may have fallen, but I will
find my way back to Him.

380
00:32:21,013 --> 00:32:24,712
Yeah, whatever you say. You know,
I'll just settle for catching Voss.

381
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:28,043
<i>Jo. Well, you settle too easily.</i>

382
00:32:29,518 --> 00:32:31,486
You know I could say
the same about Anna.

383
00:32:31,512 --> 00:32:34,281
Although she is coming
into her own lately,

384
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:35,721
if I do say so myself.

385
00:32:36,577 --> 00:32:39,211
If I did not need your help
to protect my family,

386
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:40,998
you and I would never speak again.

387
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:46,730
I need to know I can depend on you.

388
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,471
I'm ready when you are, Funkytown.

389
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:56,917
<i>All the way through Hoopdale
here and possibly here,</i>

390
00:32:56,943 --> 00:32:59,176
which is going to force
a bubble of product.

391
00:32:59,202 --> 00:33:01,502
Where? We don't know that yet,

392
00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:04,072
but what we do know is, um...

393
00:33:05,044 --> 00:33:08,041
I'm sorry. I need to take this.
This is important.

394
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:10,959
- Alright, I got this.
- Alright. Thank you, sir.

395
00:33:10,985 --> 00:33:12,780
- I'll be right back.
- Alright.

396
00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:15,147
Right.

397
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:16,952
We don't know where that bubble
is gonna come through, but...

398
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:18,128
Canada, what you got for me?

399
00:33:18,316 --> 00:33:20,302
I need two coffins sent to Mexico.

400
00:33:20,328 --> 00:33:23,404
Each one will have a body
and a whack of Menno cash.

401
00:33:23,656 --> 00:33:26,334
The lids gotta stay shut;
Otherwise, Voss will get pissed

402
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,562
<i>- and my C.I.'s will die.
- Bodies?</i>

403
00:33:28,838 --> 00:33:30,334
What the hell's going on up there?

404
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,834
<i>You know, it's starting to heat up.
But I have it under control.</i>

405
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:36,503
<i>- Why can't your people handle it?
- Well,</i>

406
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:40,107
<i>- because as of yesterday, "my people" got me fired.
- They what?!</i>

407
00:33:40,203 --> 00:33:42,738
I was right. Voss bought one of my own.

408
00:33:42,764 --> 00:33:46,756
Geez! And this is
your version of "under control"?

409
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:48,907
If there's a dirty cop up there,
just take it

410
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,951
<i>- to internal affairs.
- I-I would,</i>

411
00:33:50,985 --> 00:33:53,042
but currently, I lack credibility,

412
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:55,237
so the only way to fix this

413
00:33:55,263 --> 00:33:57,332
and turn it around is to get Voss

414
00:33:57,358 --> 00:33:59,653
and prove that my case
was scuttled from the inside.

415
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,929
<i>But listen, I have a plan, OK?</i>

416
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,449
We'll get Voss up to Canada,
and we can throw a net on him up here.

417
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:08,494
If I do this,

418
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,759
<i>I'm gonna have to call in
a massive favour.</i>

419
00:34:10,905 --> 00:34:12,873
I have friends inside the Aduana,

420
00:34:12,907 --> 00:34:15,076
but this is gonna cost me big.

421
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:18,552
And I'm supposed to burn all that
good will on a Mennonite pastor

422
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,581
<i>and an ex-cop who "lacks credibility"?</i>

423
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:24,408
Agent O'Reilly, my ass is hanging out
the window and I need your help.

424
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,995
Emma, I can't find her.

425
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,482
Tina!

426
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,840
We'll have to go without her.

427
00:34:46,153 --> 00:34:47,262
Ezekiel.

428
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:51,048
Ezekiel?

429
00:34:52,778 --> 00:34:53,785
<i>Komme.</i>

430
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:05,759
Komme.

431
00:35:28,983 --> 00:35:32,634
May God have mercy on the souls
of these two men.

432
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:35,418
Ernesto Deckert and the...

433
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,301
pilot "Diego Penner."

434
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:43,269
These men have sinned greatly,

435
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:46,629
<i>as have many others,
even among the Edentaler.</i>

436
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:51,204
We can only hope
for forgiveness and redemption

437
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,240
when we stand in the face of our Lord

438
00:35:53,274 --> 00:35:54,747
as these men do now.

439
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:58,312
If we admit our sins freely

440
00:35:58,683 --> 00:36:00,314
and repent with shame

441
00:36:00,717 --> 00:36:02,199
and humility

442
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:05,496
and sincere regret,

443
00:36:06,753 --> 00:36:08,512
then perhaps there is hope.

444
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,971
And now, for his part in the death
of these two men,

445
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:17,272
Joey Epp will lead us

446
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:20,067
in a prayer of repentance.

447
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:26,955
Dear Lord...

448
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:31,588
I have sinned.

449
00:36:37,134 --> 00:36:39,686
I let my brother lead me away from you.

450
00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:45,452
Please help me find my way back.

451
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:50,308
- Amen.
- Amen.

452
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:02,951
It's done.

453
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:05,939
The bodies are on their way to Voss.

454
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:07,461
Then what?

455
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:10,476
We wait. His move next.

456
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:15,315
<i>Jo?</i>

457
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:18,542
OK.

458
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:22,522
Joey wants his truck back.

459
00:38:22,788 --> 00:38:24,500
Since when did you start using a phone?

460
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,709
Joey gave it to us. It was Gerry's.

461
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:30,286
That's Gerry's phone?

462
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:32,841
What the hell was Joey doing with it?

463
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,568
These are the contacts on it.

464
00:38:38,055 --> 00:38:40,916
First names and numbers of all the
people. I wrote them into my book.

465
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:42,609
I've contacted all of them. Yeah, well,

466
00:38:42,643 --> 00:38:44,623
except for the third one.

467
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,326
What? "Balia"?

468
00:38:47,352 --> 00:38:49,417
- Belial.
- Belial. Why not?

469
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:50,443
Why didn't you call?

470
00:38:51,944 --> 00:38:53,153
It's the name of a devil.

471
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,700
Like, like the real devil?

472
00:38:56,726 --> 00:39:00,460
Someone who walks in the laws
of darkness, pride, idolatry.

473
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:03,587
OK.

474
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,164
Kingsley.

475
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:11,012
<i>Voda.</i>

476
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,061
I've been thinking about Article 9

477
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:16,970
and how it relates to you.

478
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,333
And it commands its leaders

479
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,307
to "provide for all of the wants"

480
00:40:21,342 --> 00:40:23,710
of the Church according
to their abilities."

481
00:40:23,744 --> 00:40:25,608
So I was wondering,

482
00:40:25,713 --> 00:40:29,295
<i>since our Ordnung permits
the use of motorized vehicles</i>

483
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:31,384
and you used one
to provide for the wants

484
00:40:31,418 --> 00:40:33,746
of the Church according
to your abilities,

485
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,222
then you're just doing as God commands,

486
00:40:36,257 --> 00:40:37,479
right?

487
00:40:44,966 --> 00:40:47,578
That is an excellent question

488
00:40:48,944 --> 00:40:52,206
that requires a trip to my library
for an answer.

489
00:41:44,024 --> 00:41:45,024
<i>Jo?</i>

490
00:41:57,671 --> 00:42:00,036
I wanna see it done, in person.

491
00:42:00,545 --> 00:42:01,578
<i>Yes.</i>

492
00:42:02,051 --> 00:42:03,681
And I want to make a trade.

493
00:42:04,414 --> 00:42:06,827
My freedom for the new delivery system,

494
00:42:07,295 --> 00:42:08,681
<i>safety for my family,</i>

495
00:42:08,716 --> 00:42:10,367
<i>protection from Gerry Epp,</i>

496
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:13,853
and I want to go back
to being a normal pastor.

497
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:17,223
You are not a normal pastor.

498
00:42:17,632 --> 00:42:18,988
<i>These are my terms.</i>

499
00:42:20,295 --> 00:42:24,261
You come and I will show you
how to do this new process.

500
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:27,471
<i>Nee. You come show me here.</i>

501
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:29,072
Sunrise,

502
00:42:29,098 --> 00:42:31,232
<i>day after tomorrow.
There will be a plane</i>

503
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:33,627
<i>waiting at the airstrip
outside of Chatham.</i>

504
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:36,616
Bring the chemist
who thought of the idea.

505
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,868
These are my terms.
