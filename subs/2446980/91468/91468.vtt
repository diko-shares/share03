00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,795
You have a honey now?
Since when?

2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,115
Let it ride.

3
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,559
Done stuff with her?

4
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,233
But that guy's a dick.

5
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,032
He's a walking butthole!

6
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,869
l'm killing myself...

7
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,917
Turn on the sex ray.
Walk over and lock lips.

8
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,997
Rape her too? Great advice!

9
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
You may not get the chance again.

10
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,556
Don't you ever make a move?

11
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,712
l'm the Arabic romantic type.
Plus l'm onto Laura.

12
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,679
Ok, here l go!

13
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,519
Hi there. Ok?

14
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,716
Who are you?

15
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,597
l guess you wouldn't want
to go out with me?

16
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,317
No.

17
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,675
Well?

18
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,635
lt looks good.

19
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,717
She just split up with a guy

20
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,799
and isn't ready for anything
too volcanic yet.

21
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,273
You see. Always make a move.
Always.

22
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,592
THE FRENCH KlSSERS

23
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,757
Your hair's really classy.

24
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,915
Yeah?

25
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,192
This is kind of awkward...

26
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,198
Don't let anyone see us.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,831
You can keep a secret, right?

28
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,550
l heard what you said to Leslie.

29
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,957
lt was cute. She doesn't know
what she's missing.

30
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,674
l was thinking we could meet later,

31
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,588
then go to my place and make love.

32
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,350
l want a man's body close to mine.

33
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,230
But only if you want to, ok?

34
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,192
l want to. You bet l do!

35
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,515
See you later.

36
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,629
Laura was supposed to be mine!

37
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,713
Yeah, but l make the moves.
On your advice.

38
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,473
She's dumped Loic?

39
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,233
He'll beat you to a pulp.

40
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,717
She's dumb.

41
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,592
She's so hot.

42
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,030
Her eyes are blue as detergent.

43
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,673
Maybe you'll shag her.

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,118
l'll kill myself if you do.

45
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,551
No, first you, then myself.

46
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,397
Go, Lucky Strike!

47
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,636
The TV mag.

48
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,550
Mahmoud...

49
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,950
What now?

50
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,355
- l blow you in the toilets.
- Yeah?

51
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,119
With a mug like that?

52
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,630
Well?

53
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,716
What's that?

54
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,478
The biology test.

55
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,716
- There's a test?
- Yeah, a test.

56
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,639
''Yeah, a test.''
Stupid cow.

57
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,876
- You knew?
- There's no test.

58
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,833
- There's a test?
- Shit, l forgot!

59
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,508
You jerks, he told us two weeks ago.

60
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,348
lt'll be just another crap grade
for you.

61
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,676
Let me see.

62
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,757
lt's too late to revise now!

63
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,918
''lt's too late now.''
Are you dumb or what?

64
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,679
What a clown!

65
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,716
ln-flight collision
between Hervé and my bag.

66
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,194
Got any cash?

67
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,636
Hey, it's Moumoud!
Moumoud, the class hood!

68
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,068
ls it you, Moumoud?

69
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,035
Think you're tough,
big boy in the 'hood?

70
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,275
He's paying

71
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,517
for massacring innocents
in a previous life.

72
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,068
Hands down.

73
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,478
Who is this brute?

74
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,352
- Loic, ma'am.
- lt wasn't me.

75
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,790
Silence. You're in detention!

76
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,709
Put that cross away!
Very pretty...

77
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,869
l was revising till midnight.
l'm beat.

78
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,593
Let me see the test.

79
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,232
- Yeah, let's see.
- Cut it out.

80
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,510
What's it on? Penetration?

81
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,948
Piss off, will you!

82
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,832
ls there a test today?

83
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,318
Camel, hearing you makes me want
to go back to bed. Sit down.

84
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,114
Sir, you said the test was next week.

85
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,232
- ls it next week?
- Sure, Benjamin. Sit down.

86
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,915
ls there a test?

87
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,597
You're not all going to ask
the same question.

88
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,794
You noted it
and l told you four times.

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,958
Hervé, you only need your pencil case.

90
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,789
Aurore, sit down.

91
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,753
ls there really a test?

92
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,078
Didn't you note it down?

93
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,350
- Yes, l did.
- That's good.

94
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,158
l noted there was a test.

95
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,679
That's good, Océane.

96
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,589
Quiet.

97
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,158
Loic, pass this back.

98
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,439
From all the girls.

99
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,629
Yeah?

100
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,278
UR AN UGLY SHlTHED

101
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,755
What is it?

102
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,430
What is it?

103
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,229
Goodbye.

104
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,272
Come and see, sweetheart.

105
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,039
lt's a disaster. Look.

106
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,959
My washing's filthy.

107
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,710
Boxers, T-shirts, socks...
l'll have to do it all again.

108
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,148
lt stinks of shit!

109
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,311
Don't be so vulgar.

110
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,234
No idea what it is.

111
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,113
lt's from your teacher's balcony
upstairs.

112
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,517
l looked but he says
it's not from his place.

113
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,030
He touched me up in the elevator.

114
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,711
He touched my cock like this.

115
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,877
Stupid, that's not funny.

116
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,158
No one will believe you
if it ever happens

117
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,999
and it'll ruin your life.

118
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,555
Thanks, l can count on you.

119
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,909
l'm sorry.

120
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,237
Hold on, people can see us.

121
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,636
<i>Fifteenth Street</i>

122
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,915
<i>Hello, everybody,
and welcome to your very own show.</i>

123
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,155
<i>This week's class...</i>

124
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,750
Know what l found in my e-mail
at the agency?

125
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,870
No, tell me.

126
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,833
Your report. Sent by e-mail.
Very modern.

127
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,156
You liked it. Was it a blast?

128
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,512
lt's not brilliant.

129
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,233
Can't you get more than 1 0?

130
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,317
1 0 is better than less.

131
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,869
They can't throw me out now anyway.

132
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,389
l wish you'd get 1 1 or 1 2 for once.

133
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,556
l'd see you making progress.

134
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,759
Like a plant growing.

135
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,116
But you creep over the ground.
See what l mean?

136
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,398
You're a poet now?

137
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,637
Your teachers never put
''room for improvement''.

138
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,353
lt's always ''average''.

139
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,039
There's less and less room
for average people.

140
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,993
Nice pasta bake, huh?

141
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,597
l loved that as a kid.

142
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,590
- You're weird.
- That's depression.

143
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,277
You get all nostalgic.

144
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,038
l have to express it.
How else can l share it?

145
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,869
Hervé...

146
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,835
Be nice...

147
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,748
to your mother.

148
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,879
Move your damn feet.

149
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,076
Come right on in!

150
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,959
Sorry.

151
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,754
No, l'm busy.

152
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,713
Calm down,
l just need to put this away.

153
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,355
l want some peace!

154
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,592
- To masturbate?
- Enough!

155
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,234
Get out!

156
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,839
<i>From 6 to 8 daily,</i>

157
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,350
<i>your techno wake-up on Bretunes.</i>

158
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,477
<i>Megamix.</i>

159
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,116
Fuck...

160
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,070
So, remember, if B, D and K
are equal to zero...

161
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,595
l get on the bus, hold the pole,

162
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,348
and l get this really wild hard-on.

163
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,313
Electromagnetic waves cause that.

164
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,754
ln your cock,
you have these receivers

165
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,439
that react to engines.

166
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,077
The waves dilate the veins,

167
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,113
they fill with blood
and you get hard.

168
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,753
lt's hell in construction.

169
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,873
The guys on bulldozers
have wood all day long.

170
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,870
l wouldn't mind driving one.

171
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,553
l have your homework.

172
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,639
From last time.

173
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,958
lt looks as if most of you
don't understand coordinates.

174
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,953
We'll review that.

175
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,032
Can you do it in order?

176
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,792
- Good idea.
- No!

177
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,319
To see our ranking,

178
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,513
how we're evolving.

179
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,875
That requires a debate
but there's no time now.

180
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,238
- l think we want a debate, sir.
- Who asked you?

181
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,271
Sir, Wulfran is class rep.

182
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,712
We elected him.
He can do something for once,

183
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,830
so let him.

184
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,829
Sit down.

185
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,235
Who wants to vote on a debate?

186
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,273
Looks like the majority.
A debate's in order.

187
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,072
Sit down.

188
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,555
- What is this?
- Ranking is good.

189
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,479
- You're nuts.
- You're a total crypto-fascist.

190
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,636
You said it. You're nuts.

191
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,389
Life is all about ranking.
The strong crush the weak.

192
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,072
l like a chick's feet best.

193
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,874
When l look at a shoe's creases,

194
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,640
l know if a chick has pretty feet.

195
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,354
You're a total deviant fetishist.

196
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,198
So who has pretty feet?

197
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,870
- Laura?
- Pretty feet.

198
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,236
- The history teacher.
- So-so.

199
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,431
- Jennifer?
- No, ugly feet.

200
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,196
Aurore.

201
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,356
Yeah, not bad feet l'd say.

202
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,631
Me?

203
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,159
Yours are gross.

204
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,711
Your face tells me that.

205
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,475
Thanks a lot.

206
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,795
No room here!

207
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,435
Get lost.

208
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,992
We could have let him.

209
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,355
We don't have to.

210
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,437
When do we get a chick?

211
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,595
Jennifer,

212
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,315
l love you. And my love, see,

213
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,958
is like an ocean.

214
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,319
And you're the beach.

215
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,673
Will you be my beach?

216
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,748
Yeah.

217
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,039
Fuck, no!

218
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,035
Hello.

219
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,277
Do you have a double-bass score
by Mozart?

220
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,751
Everything's over there.

221
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,314
You again? Stop pissing me off!

222
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,988
What are you staring at?
Get lost!

223
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,555
Move it!

224
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,275
Move it!

225
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,639
Hey, you two apes up there,
cut it out!

226
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,239
For Christ's sake...

227
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,028
- What?
- Excuse me...

228
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,477
Have you seen a man, aged 40,

229
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,113
smoking all the time?

230
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,916
l'm sorry, l don't understand.

231
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,869
My husband went out. There are riots.

232
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,348
De Gaulle has fled.

233
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,074
Didn't you know?
This is the future.

234
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,436
They just thawed you out.

235
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,233
Talk about heartless.

236
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,919
Hey, it's funny.

237
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,912
More mail order?
Can't we get a real porn mag?

238
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,629
These are real girls. lt's good.

239
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,680
Look, it's rare.
A collector's item.

240
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,879
La Redoute 1 986.

241
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,435
l took it from my gran's
after she died.

242
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,556
Noticed?

243
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,993
The photos aren't touched up
like nowadays.

244
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,633
Look, you can see

245
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,712
their pussies and nipples.

246
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,319
Silky soft breasts...

247
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,709
Silky, thick breasts, like your hair!

248
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,069
That's my style.

249
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,670
Hi.

250
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,912
That old woman was weird.

251
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,229
Yeah.

252
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,913
- Think it's Alzheimer's?
- Probably.

253
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,954
lmagine us like that.

254
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,752
Yeah! We'll get cancer!

255
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,795
- Turn your Arab music down.
- Knock!

256
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,956
We share this bathroom.

257
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,833
What were you doing?

258
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,397
Masturbating?
Thinking of what?

259
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,592
Of you!
Jesus, haven't you heard of privacy?

260
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,631
l gave birth to you,
so spare me privacy.

261
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,035
You piss me off, ok!

262
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,629
You piss me off!
l'm sick of it!

263
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,070
You fucking piss me off!

264
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,029
Back off or l'll call
the abused kids' helpline!

265
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,992
So call it. Call it!

266
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,509
You'll have a great life in a home!

267
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,192
You piss me off!

268
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,435
Yes, it'd be great!

269
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,519
Every day, you're here
busting my balls about jerking off!

270
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,551
You piss me off!

271
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,797
You can't jerk off in peace
around here!

272
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,279
l don't believe it.

273
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,072
Shit, it sucks.

274
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,119
- What's up?
- lt's bad.

275
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,435
Yeah?

276
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,794
Why are you crying?

277
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,149
What's going on?

278
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,635
- Good news: Loic's dead.
- No kidding?

279
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,159
What killed him?

280
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,632
The main thing is he's dead.

281
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,513
''My sweet wife,

282
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,188
''l'm writing this on a flat stone

283
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,118
''amid the mud and shells,

284
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,629
''between two showers of icy rain.

285
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,436
''l don't know if it will reach you.
l'd rather not think about that.''

286
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,632
What was it? An overdose?

287
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,195
Meningitis.

288
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,233
He was doing this
like he had a stiff neck.

289
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,353
They'll quarantine us.

290
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,360
l bet loads of us are condemned.

291
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,239
You're losing it, dude.

292
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,469
The gang of four,

293
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,230
you could at least listen
with a little respect.

294
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,434
Are you sensitive?

295
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,396
Deep inside.

296
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,832
Are you totally frozen up?

297
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,877
No, sir, we're not frozen up.

298
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,592
Glad to hear it, Camel.

299
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,915
l'll carry on.

300
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,352
''A new offensive
has led us into battle.''

301
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,954
Hervé, l'll do you a turd burger.

302
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,349
Fuck!

303
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,389
Loic, death is not always the end.

304
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,352
lt can be a beginning too.

305
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,595
Can't it, ma'am?

306
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,279
Yes, that's true.

307
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,155
lt's like your final exam.
You think it's an end

308
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,316
but it's the start of a new era.

309
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,071
Plus, you're a good student.

310
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,354
What happened?

311
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,471
lt was the tap, it's not piss.

312
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,149
Loic's granddad died.

313
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,391
His granddad! l thought...

314
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,793
Are your grandparents dead?

315
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,549
Yeah, in a crash when l was tiny.
l don't remember them.

316
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,591
Crushed, all four in one go.

317
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,714
Mine are alive.

318
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,309
lt'd be weird if they died.
l love them.

319
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,036
Don't worry, they won't die.

320
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,316
They will one day but not yet.

321
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,432
Grandparents usually die
at a really old age.

322
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,319
Are yours average old?

323
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,476
Yeah.

324
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,796
Average means they'll never die.

325
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,672
Well, they will but...

326
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,951

Maybe, but it could be more forceful.

342
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,632
And l'm not sure
50 Cent is a historical figure.

343
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,115
C'mon, he's totally historical!

344
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,672

say anything first?

Faint while you do it!

351
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,109
Follow the cones.
Memorise the path.

Loic just dumped her.

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,355
Camel, pathetic!

364
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,755
- Are you ok?
- Belt up, you ugly cow!

365
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,632
l don't hear the whistle?

366
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,838
Your bag's so heavy!

367
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,635
What's in it?

368
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,439
- You steal stuff?
- No.

369
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,232
Let me see.

370
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,152
l steal. l got this today.

371
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,473
- What for?
- No idea. lt's a buzz.

372
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,238
A really big buzz.

373
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,279
Each time,
l tell myself it's the last.

374
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,516
That's when it gets really good.

375
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,554
l often dump the stuff.
Stealing's the best part.

376
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,549
Don't you get that?

377
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,670
No.

378
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,872
Usually, l prefer to buy
but stealing's cool.

379
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,839
Girls like broken noses.

380
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,555
They're kind of sexy and virile,
like boxers.

381
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,718
l'm no big fan though.

382
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,996
l hope mine's not broken.
lt's huge enough already.

383
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,635
Does it hurt?

384
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,310
- lf l do this, does it hurt?
- Fuck!

385
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,519
Must be tough kissing.

386
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,635
Gotta go.

387
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,033
What's taking so long?

388
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,076
Piss off, asshole.

389
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,270
Hi.

390
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,479
Busy Saturday night?

391
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,590
Saturday? l don't like
going out much on Saturdays.

392
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,758
lt's the only day l get to rest, see.

393
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,715
My sister's having a party
for her business school diploma.

394
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,991
l can invite some pals.

395
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,632
l don't know if l'm busy.
l'll let you know.

396
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,395
Hi.

397
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,313
l'm free. Can l come?

398
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,709
Well, listen...

399
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,636
l'll see.

400
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,230
Are people like Laura going?
ls Laura going?

401
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,755
Well, listen...

402
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,635
l have to go.

403
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,833
She wants your body!

404
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,395
Bullshit.
She can invite pals.

405
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,079
She insisted on ''pals''.

406
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,189
She wants your body.
l'll hook Laura, Arabic-style.

407
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,759
Gimme the banana.

408
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,795
Pass me the brew.

409
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,755
Are you all set?

410
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,476
There's a corpse-like mood...

411
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,788
Let's get started.

412
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,913
Satan, Prince of Darkness,

413
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,473
allow your children
to speak to the dead.

414
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,196
Satan, Prince of Darkness,

415
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,758
allow your children
to speak to the dead.

416
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,108
Who are you, Spirit of the Darkness?

417
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,556
Lucifer?

418
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,199
ls it you, Grandpa?

419
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,397
Hitler?

420
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,510
- Fuck, it's Hitler!
- Stop right there.

421
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,032
Ask him a question.

422
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,876
Hitler, will l get
to lock lips with Laura

423
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,792
or shag her at the party?

424
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,396
N...

425
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,189
O...

426
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,469
W...

427
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,272
A... Y.

428
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,752
Weird, Hitler saying, ''No way.''

429
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,831
Who'll get a chick first?

430
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,109
B...

431
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,710
E...

432
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,957
N.

433
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,831
Jerk!

434
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,268
You're heavy, dude!

435
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,994
l didn't move it.

436
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,997
My heart was pounding!

437
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,912
l wasn't moving it, ok!

438
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,189
This sucks anyway.

439
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,352
We should kill animals.

440
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,955
Let's get chickens from a pet shop.

441
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,992
- Right.
- Let's do the TV thing.

442
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,350
You tune to a scrambled channel,

443
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,996
call up spirits
and they create interference.

444
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,753
- That sucks.
- lt sucks.

445
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,469
All your ideas suck.

446
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,954
- You suck.
- Yeah, you suck.

447
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,919
You suck and you're fat.

448
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,631
My phone!

449
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,838
A phone? You only know us.

450
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,195
Shut up.

451
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,118
Hello, Mum?

452
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,435
''Hello, Mum''...

453
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,673
Could you tell Camel
not to come, please?

454
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,034
He's forcing himself in
and Laura won't come if he does.

455
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,674
lt's because he's an Arab, right?

456
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,393
Rubbish. That's not why.

457
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,751
He'll understand.
l'm like his big brother.

458
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,038
Can we come to Aurore's party?

459
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,117
- We'd like to come too.
- No way.

460
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,074
Try to get us in. Make an effort...

461
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,510
lt's not that big, there's no room.

462
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,196
lt's invitation only.
Some guests can't even come.

463
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,594
lt's touch and go for me.

464
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,392
You shit, you could ask.

465
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,273
Forget it.
They're glad to get rid of us.

466
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,277
l see what hypocrisy is now.

467
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,357
Get outta here. Give us a break.

468
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,633
- What do we do?
- l wanted to tell you...

469
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,673
l mean...

470
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,911
l might not be going.

471
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,358
l bet it'll suck, let's not go.

472
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,711
lt'll be a blast. lf you don't go

473
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,990
give me her address. l'll go.

474
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,429
You're nuts.

475
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,077
Emma on Mondrian.

476
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,754
Excellent. 1 8.

477
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,277
lt's not the end of the world.
You can improve.

478
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,315
''Only tears can heal,''
Oscar Wilde said.

479
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,992
1 4 and she's blubbing. What a joke.

480
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,913
Mahmoud...

481
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,750
Not a bad essay on Jimmy Carter.

482
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,992
1 7. Laura...

483
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,713
''The borderline experiences

484
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,673
''of a teacher
in Brittany's gay underworld.''

485
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,955
What's that?

486
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,629
Can you sign it?

487
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,549
Later.

488
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,155
Put that away.

489
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,155
Hervé...

490
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,277
An essay on an American rap artist...

491
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,873
50 Cents.

492
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,274
A bad start

493
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,153
but the conclusion sheds a new light.
Charming. 1 2.

494
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,639
Holy cow, 1 2 out of 20!

495
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,712
The best day of my life!

496
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,511
Camel, you chose Rocco Siffredi.

497
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,594
No historical relevance:
8 out of 20.

498
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,159
l worked my ass off!

499
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,755
Language.

500
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,193
Get out the soldiers' letters.

501
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,195
We'll carry on reading.

502
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,879
Lend us one, we forgot ours.

503
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,308
- Sure.
- Cool. Thanks.

504
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,555
Or rather no.

505
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,318
This is hypocrisy, see.

506
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,953
Don't be a shit, man.

507
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,037
l think we were up to...

508
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,033
page 1 29.

509
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,108
''A new offensive
has led us into battle.''

510
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,111
- Get down now.
- No, l'm ok.

511
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,959
Three heavy flow packs.
The violet ones.

512
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,718
Who's this l see?

513
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,189
My pal Hervé.

514
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,351
- Check, man. How goes it?
- Hello.

515
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,637
Hello, ma'am.

516
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,555
Mr Jeanquatte, the year supervisor.

517
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,672
- Hello.
- Ma'am.

518
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,918
You must have plenty on your plate
with him.

519
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,957
He's a real hoodlum, Hervé.

520
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,389
Meaning?

521
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,190
lf he's trouble, let me know, ok.

522
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,833
No, he's one of the nicest kids
and he's well-behaved too.

523
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,512
He gets that from his father.
He's in the army.

524
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,508
Everyone has to get out of his way.
Hervé's like that too.

525
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,228
Put him in detention,
it'll do him good.

526
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,873
Hello.

527
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,156
Hervé, 3C. And his mother.

528
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,995
We haven't finished.

529
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,349
We'll leave you to it.

530
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,671
Happy shopping.

531
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,995
- lt's a secret, ok?
- No problem, nigga.

532
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,996
Goodbye.

533
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,960
ls there a girl you're sweet on
at this party?

534
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,275
l bet there is.

535
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,194
You actually asked to come here today.

536
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,354
You want to dress up?

537
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,631
You know life inside out.

538
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,109
l know you.

539
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,436
l'm inside your head!

540
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,835
Look at the sweater!

541
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,872
l need one.
They all have one in my class.

542
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,196
- Please.
- No.

543
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,596
Top quality. lt'll last 5 years.

544
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,032
lt's an Arab thing. Hideous!

545
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,152
l am an Arab. Please...

546
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,673
You're not coming.

547
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,950
Leave your hair.
You're not coming.

548
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,879
- l'll just see where you're going.
- Stay here.

549
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,429
Come on.

550
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,434
Get lost now, ok.

551
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,551
- Sure this is it?
- Yes, l am.

552
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,159
Cut it out!

553
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,239
You're pissing me off!

554
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,840
Véner? What're you doing here?

555
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,359
Aurore invited me.

556
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,994
Don't tell me you believed her?

557
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,239
Brought your woman?

558
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,836
- Who's this?
- My name's Hervé.

559
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,270
Come in. Don't just stand there.

560
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,075
l love your name.

561
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,397
l'm Constance.

562
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,992
Come and get a drink.

563
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,031
Hervé! This is Hervé.

564
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,800
My cousins:
Ludivine, Marie and Suzanne.

565
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,675
- Great sweater!
- Going out with our cousin?

566
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,030
- What? You're nuts!
- She's right.

567
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,310
You're dumb if you don't.

568
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,909
- He's way handsome!
- He's way ugly!

569
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,758
Yeah, he's ugly.

570
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,114
This is Hervé.

571
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,309
The bloody nose...

572
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,719
You're very cute though.
Hello.

573
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,876
Why did you say he was a bit...

574
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,191
Ok? What's wrong?

575
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,836
Nothing. l'm in shock.
The bar hit my nose really hard.

576
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,632
We hear a lot about you.

577
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,354
Hello. Well, good evening.

578
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,636
l'm his mother. My name's Zoé.

579
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,955
Delighted. Véronique.

580
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,553
Tonight's party

581
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,797
is for my daughter's
business school diploma.

582
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,390
Just one child?

583
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,469
He's multiple. lt's like having loads.

584
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,189
How amusing.

585
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,029
Are you multiple too?

586
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,116
No, l'm depressive.

587
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,870
That's sad.

588
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,632
This is Eric, Anas' father.
We were at school together.

589
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,912
And Loic's father.
We went to the same school.

590
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,152
lt all brings back memories...

591
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,914
What does your Mum do?

592
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,556
She's trying to write
and she used to model too.

593
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,755
That's neat.

594
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,996
Want something to eat or drink?

595
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,673
No, no alcohol.

596
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,031
Aurore! Look who's here!

597
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,719
Eudes!

598
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,238
You look fabulous!

599
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,671
l'm hot, let's dance.

600
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,638
You're here, are you?

601
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,757
lt'll be a great night then.

602
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,949
You hunk!

603
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,112
Camel, it can't be here.
We're too far out of town.

604
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,038
Are you sure it's out here?

605
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,313
Yes, this is it.

606
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,510
Where?

607
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,794
Know what? l want you.

608
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,116
Shit!

609
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,312
Another stepmother to add to the list.

610
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,918
Know what we call my dad?

611
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,519
Dickman.

612
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,518
Only natural. He's hot.

613
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,878
- Want to dance?
- Yeah. l dance pretty well too.

614
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,429
St Grégoire shopping mall! Asshole!

615
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,632
You really took me for a ride,
you bastard!

616
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,030
Want a drink?

617
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,549
He gave me the wrong address
on purpose.

618
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,916
Don't go out with this jerk.

619
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,756
They're together?

620
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,838
That's why l didn't want you to come.

621
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,436
Fuck!

622
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,552
La Redoute 1 986, page 320,
lingerie, on the couch.

623
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,756
That one's mine!

624
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,109
That one's mine!

625
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,070
That's Camel!

626
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,989
Want to dance?

627
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,517
What?

628
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,029
l screwed up.
He's a sex addict.

629
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,352
Big problem, he's married...

630
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,439
Ok, we're leaving!

631
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,798
l was an inch from lip-lock.

632
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,991
An inch away isn't spot on.

633
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,350
And Aurore's Mum is old and all.

634
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,358
You're nuts.
Mature women are the hottest.

635
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,913
She's hotmom.com.

636
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,950
What?

637
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,596
Really hot porn with mothers
banging teenage boys.

638
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,995
ls it any good?

639
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,873
My fave, so you can see why l'm happy.

640
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,878
You're going to give up on Laura now?

641
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,433
l can handle both.

642
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,436
Way to go!

643
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,229
- Not taking the bus?
- l'm walking.

644
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,714
On your own?

645
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,831
l don't have to be with people.

646
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,840
lt was a great party. Did it end well?

647
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,950
Yeah, great.

648
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,798
Laura's mad that Camel came.

649
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,992
He kept ogling my Mum's tits.
But it was great.

650
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,109
l was wondering...

651
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,194
Would you like to go out with me?

652
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,238
- With who?
- With me.

653
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,908
With you? Are you crazy?

654
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,793
Guys want to go out
rather than be friends. l'm too young.

655
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,152
When l'm older, ok,
but why bother at our age?

656
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,960
- But it's a great experience.
- No.

657
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,598
The thing is, see,

658
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,190
you need a safe
or you can't keep it at home.

659
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,355
lf you don't use a shooting range,
they can take it back.

660
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,432
lt must be cool having a gun.

661
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,396
Ok...

662
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,190
l'll be going.

663
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,272
l have an appointment at home.

664
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,113
Ok, see you.

665
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,592
You changed your mind?

666
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,319
Turn your tongue.

667
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,836
Hey, it's my snogging style.

668
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,238
We all have our own style.

669
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,318
Thank God everyone's different.

670
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,713
Who else have you kissed?

671
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,958
Other people.

672
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,434
Girls, ltalian girls.

673
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,752
l'm off. He's ogling us.
See you tomorrow.

674
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,679
Doing your homework?

675
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,870
We've seen
how action-reaction works

676
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,992
and how a gas injection
produces an impulse...

677
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,156
Tongue and all? And the drool?

678
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,635
Doesn't it run out the side?

679
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,150
lt just happens naturally.
lt gets sucked back in.

680
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,239
Your mouth's a sucker?

681
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,635
The movement keeps the drool in.

682
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,071
There's a current,
like with a boat's propeller.

683
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,713
What movement?

684
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,229
The tongues turn. l'll show you.

685
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,356
There.

686
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,518
Change direction now.

687
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,275
What's going on?

688
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,434
This part of the nozzle
becomes broader...

689
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,749
Camel...

690
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,678
l'll let you kiss me.

691
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,473
Ok, go on then.

692
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,238
Dare you to kiss her now.

693
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,793
Think l made it up?

694
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,319
A quick kiss is nothing.

695
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,269
What happened?

696
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,959
lt's over.

697
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,788
She's gone off me.
lt didn't last long.

698
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,238
''l'm in hell here.

699
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,474
''Suffering and pain are my companions.

700
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,198
''Perhaps l'll miss them one day
in the same way that l miss you.''

701
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,636
Come on.

702
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,875
What's up?

703
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,192
- You're crying?
- No way.

704
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,669
lt's the candy.

705
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,791
Lemon drops make my eyes water.

706
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,275
You can pretend you're crying.

707
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,310
You were ashamed of me earlier.

708
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,159
No, but l don't want others
to know, ok?

709
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,115
lt's our secret.

710
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,039
lf l was Loic,
you'd tell everyone then.

711
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,357
Loic? Give me a break,
he's like my brother.

712
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,195
You've heard of incest, right?

713
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,749
Let's get married

714
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,599
and have kids.

715
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,430
Then we can go on TV
as France's youngest parents.

716
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,355
l dunno. Kind of soon, isn't it?

717
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,553
l was kidding, stupid!

718
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,473
Having a kid must be fun.
He obeys you...

719
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,240
He does what you say.
He tidies your room...

720
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,393
- What's up?
- Shut it!

721
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,636
Gotta go or my Mum will yell.

722
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,271
You throw a ball and l shut up?

723
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,391
Don't act smart with me!

724
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,670
l just want an apology, ok!

725
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,950
- ln your dreams!
- Apologise!

726
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,631
Hello!

727
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,991
Are you the gay Arab
looking to get it up the ass?

728
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,673
Piss off! Who let you in?

729
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,632
Grumpy little piggy...

730
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,116
You turn up late,
act like this is your place...

731
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,071
Get yourself a chick too.

732
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,789
You're happy.

733
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,513
Happy with your slut!

734
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,638
What's up with him?

735
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,354
Respect me for what l am.

736
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,993
- You shagged her?
- Yeah.

737
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,668
ln a bush, a real S&M scene, man.

738
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,838
- No kidding?
- Moron!

739
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,995
You can do it at our age.
We're not kids anymore.

740
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,315
She's not ready.

741
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,752
She's a bit uptight.

742
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,872
But it's serious.
We talked about having kids.

743
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,670
Locking lips won't make babies.
You have to hide the sausage.

744
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,918
Remember two years ago
when Meryl's sister

745
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,077
got shagged on the beach?

746
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,269
You bet!

747
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,157
You need a honey fast.

748
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,471
Camel, you're such a fag!

749
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,674
You jerk.

750
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,917
Excuse me, ma'am...

751
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,916
lt's ages since my last shag.

752
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,631
Let me show you something.

753
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,714
ls that your dad's?

754
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,550
lt's hidden in his files.
He'll never find it.

755
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,312
l don't want to watch.

756
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,479
Once you can do it for real,
this is kind of degrading.

757
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,877
You've done nothing yet,

758
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,074
so grab a sock.

759
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,191
<i>The site with all the hot Mums</i>

760
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,873
<i>l have a free afternoon.
My kids aren't here.</i>

761
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,359
<i>l'll make the most of it
to rub and scrub.</i>

762
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,554
<i>l love it...</i>

763
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,673
<i>when everything's clean.</i>

764
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,799
<i>Hello, is Stéphane here?
l want to go surfing.</i>

765
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,629
<i>He should be back soon.
Come in, l'm his mother.</i>

766
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,795
<i>Hello.</i>

767
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,079
<i>Do you mind if l keep on scrubbing?</i>

768
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,590
<i>No.</i>

769
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,633
<i>Oh, no!</i>

770
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,072
<i>l just cleaned it.</i>

771
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,756
<i>lt's all dirty now!</i>

772
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:23,952
Yes!

773
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,190
Hi.

774
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,069
See you.

775
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,473
l won't wake her

776
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,439
but tell her...

777
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,189
it was good.

778
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,189
l loved it.

779
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,197
See you, pal.

780
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,794
Know what it is?

781
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,116
You stole all this? What for?

782
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,594
l just leave it here.

783
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,360
l used to collect Pokémon key-rings

784
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,675
but l stopped.

785
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,229
What do your parents do?

786
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,554
Mum works in an insurance agency

787
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,996
and Dad's an air force pilot.

788
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,639
He drops bombs and stuff.

789
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,717
- They're divorced.
- Yeah?

790
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,032
l'd hate it if mine were.

791
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,672
l'd probably leave home.

792
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,677
- Cut it out.
- No one can see us.

793
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,438
Stop it! l don't want to!

794
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,438
- l'm sorry. Chill.
- What did you jump on me for?

795
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,558
What's with your briefs?

796
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,274
- Nothing.
- Why are your hands there?

797
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,038
l know, l'm ugly, l have a big nose,

798
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,993
l have zits, l suck,
l disgust you...

799
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,351
lt's not that.
You just don't jump on a girl.

800
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,592
Why are your pals Loic and Anas,
not Mahmoud or Camel?

801
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,711
You sense these things.

802
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,876
They're more receptive, see.

803
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,239
Things show if a girl's hot for you.

804
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,351
You guys don't see them.

805
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,790
You mean she sort of gurgles?

806
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,029
No, if she does this with her hair,
she's interested.

807
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,878
And the black part in her eye...

808
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,030
When it's wide open,
that means she wants to do it.

809
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,116
No.

810
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,355
No.

811
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,789
No!

812
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,394
What're you doing?

813
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,669
What're you doing?

814
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,995
Nothing.

815
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,679
You jerked off on me?

816
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,518
No. Well, yes...

817
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,073
You jerked off on me!

818
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,759
l'm sorry.

819
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,635
l couldn't stop.
Your pupil was so dilated.

820
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,148
You're sick!

821
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,916
You goddam premature pervert!
Get outta my home!

822
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,838
Get outta here!

823
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,677
Where's your chick gone?

824
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,350
l really screwed up, dude.
l think l traumatised her.

825
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,271
How?

826
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,950
She'll change schools,
call the cops or God knows what.

827
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,195
You raped her?

828
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,119
Want a banana?

829
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,869
Go on.

830
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,230
Hervé...

831
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,149
l wanted to say...

832
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,031
Want to go out? l love you.

833
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,229
Say that again.

834
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,668
l'm in love with you.

835
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,229
Look at yourself! You're a dog!

836
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,274
Poor cow!

837
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,758
What did he say? Will he?

838
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,269
Ok, stop now, that's enough.

839
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,471
You want to screw Aurore?

840
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,277
You're way too ugly, man.
Look at yourself.

841
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,190
Here, let me wipe out
all those zits.

842
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,113
What're you doing?

843
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,280
Get lost!
Are you out of your mind?

844
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,877
Loic said,
''Gimme your dough, fucker.''

845
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,392
He was shaking him down.
Aurore kissed him to defend him.

846
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,629
Aurore gave Hervé 1 0 euros
and Loic wanted to take it.

847
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,671
So she started kissing Hervé.

848
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,474
Hervé lent 20 euros to Aurore

849
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,638
and she gave back 1 0
with a kiss for the rest.

850
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,319
So Loic beat him up.

851
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,468
Hervé kissed her to pay her back.

852
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,478
Loic got mad
and tried to smash his face in.

853
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,717
Keep moving your tongue.

854
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,957
l'm perfecting my technique.

855
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,239
l hear Aurore charges 1 0 euros
to lock lips.

856
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,192
Goulven saw Hervé do it.

857
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,795
Sorry.

858
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,431
No, really, a girl!

859
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,276
No, l've never pressured him.

860
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,153
No pressure, totally cool...

861
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,036
She's cute. Her parents
threw that party we went to.

862
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,879
The way he held her...

863
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,397
He held her like a man.

864
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,034
Like a man.
lt's so weird to see that.

865
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,109
Take care.

866
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,279
Stop telling everyone
my private life!

867
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,755
- My little darling...
- Give me a break!

868
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,678
You never moaned as a kid.

869
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,630
Get rid of that crap picture.

870
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,913
l love it, you look like,
you know... little Maddy...

871
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,036
Did you know?

872
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,709
That you're a dick?

873
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,558
You could've told us.

874
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,512
l'm telling you: you're dicks.

875
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,073
Has Aurore got friends for us?

876
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,875
l get first look.
l'm onto Laura.

877
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,069
So hands off!

878
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,117
Change exercises!

879
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,790
Hold me tighter or l'll fall.

880
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,676
Let me do it, he'll drop you.

881
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,869
Piss off.

882
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,599
Busy tomorrow afternoon?

883
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,034
Come to my place.

884
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,635
And after....

885
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,158
We could do what you wanted.

886
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,272
What was that?

887
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,594
We could fuck like crazy.

888
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,074
l'll have to see.

889
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,919
Aurore, this isn't Club Med!

890
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,759
What's up, Loic?

891
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,952
l banged my nose. l'm ok.

892
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,589
You have two elbows!

893
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,393
There's a problem here!

894
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,792
Serves you right!

895
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,996
Oh, shit. Oh, bugger!

896
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,833
He has two elbows.
You have two elbows?

897
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:32,033
Oh, fucking hell with bells on.
What the fuck is this shit?

898
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,309
Not bad.

899
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,231
How's Caroline? Still on her?

900
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,834
No, it's over.

901
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,152
Gone off girls now?

902
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,519
You go out with your Arab pal, Camel?

903
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,831
No, l have a new girlfriend.

904
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,519
Aurore. She's way hot.

905
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,790
Wow, you're lining them up.

906
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,998
l hope you use condoms.

907
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,592
Sure, l even used two once,
so l'm safe.

908
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,199
l was like that.

909
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,831
Always up to stuff
the others never imagined.

910
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,039
l even slept with two girls at once.

911
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,710
Back in the day,
a kiss was the end of the world.

912
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,834
What's that smell?

913
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,518
You stepped in shit?

914
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,155
lt's my sweater.

915
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,955
This stinky stuff drips down
from the balcony upstairs.

916
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,192
lt's the airliners.

917
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,799
Their toilets leak.

918
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,560
The building must be on a flight path.

919
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,910
She should dry stuff indoors.

920
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,319
- Dad?
- Yeah?

921
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,636
Which one of you chose Hervé?

922
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,750
l did.

923
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,150
lt's a crap name.

924
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,477
Why didn't you call me
Loic or Nicolas, say?

925
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,235
Your gran loved Hervé Villard.

926
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,315
She died so we changed your name
to make her happy.

927
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,397
We'd chosen Yannick for you.

928
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,789
Like Yannick Noah.

929
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,153
But Hervé's a good name.

930
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,109
Wait right here.

931
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,231
- You don't like it?
- l do. Can l put some music on?

932
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,669
l brought a CD.

933
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,317
- Your belly hurts?
- No.

934
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,509
Need the can?

935
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,394
This is really wild.

936
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,959
l have to go.

937
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,195
What's up?

938
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,512
''Go on, harder, l'm coming!''

939
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,113
- Yeah?
- You bet!

940
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,958
- You're sure?
- She said so.

941
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,789
She said, ''Oh, Hervé,
thank you for making me come.''

942
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,996
Sometimes chicks can fake it.

943
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,708
Only in movies or crap plays.

944
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,191
They fake it in real life too.

945
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,833
Mum fooled Dad that way.

946
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,038
What's a pussy like inside?

947
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,198
Well, it's kinda...
lt's kinda soft. Well, no.

948
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,912
lt's hard and dry.
A lot drier than l thought.

949
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,076
lt's kinda like a nostril.

950
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,475
And a pointy thing enters your cock?

951
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,236
We used a whole box of condoms
we did it so much.

952
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,998
A girl on the phone for you.

953
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:36,909
Who is it?

954
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:39,909
Hi, how are you?

955
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,712
She's talking dirty? ls she?

956
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:50,069
Tomorrow...
No, tomorrow's not possible.

957
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,115
No, it's not possible at my place.

958
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,999
Yes, it is!

959
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,955
lt's possible!

960
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,796
Ok, we'll do that then.

961
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,274
See you at school.

962
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,029
Yeah, bye.

963
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,952
Shagging again tomorrow?

964
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,315
Shagging again?

965
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,311
Why do you keep people apart?

966
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,715
Why don't you introduce me?

967
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,669
Are you ashamed?

968
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,035
Why wouldn't you come to my place?

969
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,869
We need a little variety
or we'll get stuck in a rut.

970
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,516
You're scared.

971
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,909
Scared? l've fucked before.

972
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,673
That'll be us
if l stay too long with you.

973
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:37,996
l don't think so.

974
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,198
That's me over there.

975
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,032
Yeah, really classy...

976
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,309
That's us.

977
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,678
l'll have dumped you by then.

978
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,632
That's you and your son.

979
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,399
He's your son too.

980
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,429
Want to do a runner?

981
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,835
What's that?

982
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,189
We don't pay.

983
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,828
This coffee sucks.

984
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,234
Testing me again?

985
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,634
- Dare you.
- Ok.

986
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,115
Let's go. One, two,

987
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,595
three...

988
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,192
What's wit' you, man,
lookin' for a beatin'?

989
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,709
What's wit' you?

990
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,193
Hey, pooch-face, on my mother's life,
l'll waste you.

991
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,719
l've got tongue cramp
from all the sex.

992
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,118
Holy fuck...

993
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,831
That's for us!

994
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,075
Sock time.

995
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,158
She saw us?

996
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,194
- Fucking hell...
- We're in deep shit!

997
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,230
They're there. They'll kill us.

998
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,714
We're sick fucks...

999
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,275
You're the sick one, man.

1000
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,277
l had a woman, a relationship...

1001
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,869
Tell them we weren't watching them.

1002
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,229
l'll talk to them.

1003
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,116
Hello...

1004
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,954
We did nothing.

1005
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,479
Fuck!

1006
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,031
- That was close.
- You said it.

1007
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,833
Dungeons and Dragons...

1008
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,514
No, let's watch porn on your computer.

1009
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,269
No, that sucks.

1010
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,471
- D&D is shit.
- You're shit.

1011
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:02,910
lt's shit.

1012
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,076
Busy today? My parents are out.

1013
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,430
l have to go to Benjamin's.

1014
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:08,834
Can l come?

1015
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,793
We're playing a role game. lt's scary.

1016
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,150
A real game or a computer one?

1017
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,513
- A real game.
- lt'll only freak you out.

1018
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,153
l'm not chicken like you.

1019
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,839
- You know role games?
- Yeah.

1020
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,469
Come along then.

1021
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,432
Yeah, come. Wild.

1022
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,073
Ok, see you later.

1023
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:29,749
What's going on?

1024
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,075
She's not yours.

1025
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,474
She's my chick, ok!

1026
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,398
There'll be more action.

1027
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,433
What action?
We'll be playing D&D!

1028
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:39,791
Get down.

1029
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,796
- l'm class rep.
- Take off the glasses.

1030
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,239
Oh yes, you're blind.

1031
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,948
Partially sighted.

1032
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:50,879
Sorry.

1033
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,075
All right.

1034
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,191
l have some sad news for you.

1035
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,793
Your biology teacher died yesterday.

1036
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:21,071
You may attend his funeral tomorrow
if you wish. Ask for passes.

1037
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,317
ls the test still on?

1038
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:24,956
Of course not.

1039
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,593
Can you tell us how he died or not?

1040
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,670
Not.

1041
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,437
Through the thick mists
of the realm of Hyrius,

1042
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,713
three mercenaries
from the distant blasted plains

1043
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:52,317
arrived at a sacred clearing...

1044
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,593
Move!

1045
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,519
Do you have to smoke?

1046
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,870
Ok, you reach the clearing...

1047
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,877
ln the middle, a chick.

1048
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,356
An elf!

1049
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,756
What're you doing?

1050
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,350
Zounds, an elf! l hate elves.

1051
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,152
Just a second, Camelius.

1052
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:14,035
l want to kill her
with my little dagger.

1053
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:15,389
Are you serious?

1054
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,915
Just kidding.

1055
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,356
l go to greet these gentlemen.

1056
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,197
Hold on.

1057
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,313
Do a vigilance throw first.

1058
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,634
Four isn't enough.

1059
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,514
You go over

1060
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,549
without seeing a venomous schnork.

1061
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:35,357
You step on it, it bites you
and you faint.

1062
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,834
That's dumb.

1063
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,359
What do you guys do?

1064
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:39,590
- l search her.
- Me too.

1065
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,472
Throw the die first.

1066
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,072
1 3, good. Search her,

1067
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,354
take her weapon and clothes

1068
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,988
and now she's nude.

1069
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,476
Strip, Aurore.

1070
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,959
Cut it out or else!

1071
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,639
Just kidding.

1072
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,955
What is this shit game?

1073
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,838
Piss off if you don't like it!

1074
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,348
Why am l nude?

1075
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,120
- Who is this bitch?
- l'm a bitch now?

1076
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,470
Charging 1 0 euros to snog a guy

1077
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,558
and losing your cherry to Hervé
in a park

1078
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,079
lets you ruin this?

1079
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,555
- What?
- Camel told us all that.

1080
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,795
Not true.

1081
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,194
Well, it is true.

1082
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,268
- Fucking kids! l'm going!
- They're joking.

1083
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,277
Very funny. You're all jerks

1084
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,674
but you're worse.

1085
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:24,075
You're a goddam perv, you joker!

1086
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,190
Sorry.

1087
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,628
Great atmosphere.

1088
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,152
Let's start again.

1089
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,955
<i>The bloodied banner is raised</i>

1090
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,195
<i>The bloodied banner is raised</i>

1091
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,116
<i>Do you hear there in our fields</i>

1092
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:50,630
<i>The roar of those fierce fighting men?</i>

1093
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,432
lt's over, totally over.

1094
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,950
lt's ok, you'll find other chicks.

1095
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,477
But she's the woman of my life, see.

1096
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:03,313
l missed the train and my life's a mess.
l'll die alone.

1097
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,752
<i>Form up in serried ranks</i>

1098
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:11,392
Get used to it. When Dad took
the little wheels off my bicycle,

1099
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,558
l couldn't stop crying.

1100
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,473
l know how you feel.

1101
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,512
lt's the end of an era.

1102
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,313
Nostalgia's kicking in.

1103
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,116
Not great. A bit off-key.

1104
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:24,835
Seven.

1105
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,834
Now a piece by Camel that's called...

1106
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,356
''Exoskeleton Total Destruction''.

1107
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,439
So l told him,

1108
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,869
''You're worse.''

1109
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,548
What did he do? Did he feel dumb?

1110
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,512
No, he didn't say a thing.

1111
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,119
He just stared at me.

1112
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,717
Nude and unconscious...
He could've helped you.

1113
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,194
You said it.

1114
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:37,230
When you see Hervé,
with his crap hair, he looks horrible.

1115
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,113
But deep down he's cute.

1116
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,908
l don't believe it.

1117
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:54,916
Hi, Hervé.

1118
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,151
Hi.

1119
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,509
How's it going?

1120
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,916
You're a real ape. You're gross!

1121
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,149
Really cool! Thanks!

1122
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,793
What's her problem?

1123
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,070
Well then, you had reached

1124
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,876
human reproduction, l think,
with Mr Salkarian.

1125
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,115
All right...

1126
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,109
Coitus.

1127
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,352
She got on the bus,
sat down opposite me

1128
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,955
and l could tell there was something.

1129
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,230
She started pushing her hair back

1130
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,637
behind her ear.
l stared into her right eye

1131
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,717
and her pupil was dilated.

1132
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,150
l sat next to her and picked her up.

1133
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,552
Total Tunisian style.

1134
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,749
Yeah.

1135
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,354
Hey, man!

1136
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,154
You dumped Aurore?

1137
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,873
No, she dumped me.

1138
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,509
But l don't care.

1139
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,870
Rubbish, you dumped her.

1140
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,116
You have a new girl now.

1141
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,358
- Was it you or her?
- You wouldn't understand.

1142
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,551
The laundry's filthy.

1143
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,834
Covered in it.

1144
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,879
<i>Wave the flags in the stadium</i>

1145
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,833
<i>And beat the drum for Rennes!</i>

1146
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,913
<i>When the Mordelles end goes wild</i>

1147
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,873
<i>Go, Rennes! We're animals</i>

1148
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,471
Turn your tongue the other way.

1149
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,029
Sorry.

1150
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,912
No smoking.

1151
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,348
lt's not lit.

1152
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,873
- Not afraid of cancer?
- l am.

1153
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,830
l'm afraid. l'm gonna die.

1154
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:54,516
Drink up.

1155
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,470
- Want to do a runner?
- What's that?

1156
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,471
One, two, three...

1157
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,558
Can we pay, please?

1158
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,591
An Arab into heavy metal.
You don't like rap?

1159
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,110
No, it's because l feel
closer to Satan in my mind.

1160
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,638
You played really well.
You take lessons?

1161
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,832
With the Baby Violators' old guitarist.

1162
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,429
No kidding?

1163
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,755
The guys who burn chickens on stage?

1164
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,075
You know them?

1165
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,191
l have all their albums.

1166
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:37,957
Yeah?

1167
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,439
That's your scooter?

1168
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,358
- Hi.
- Since when?

1169
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,549
Yesterday.

1170
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,792
You don't take the bus now?

1171
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,151
No. l'll need a scooter
at high school anyway.

1172
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,316
lt's wicked.

1173
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,636
l keep hitting car doors for now.

1174
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,310
By the way, l wanted to say...

1175
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:08,916
l love you.

1176
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,392
- What?
- l love you.

1177
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,875
l was a jerk and all before

1178
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,071
but l've lived through stuff now

1179
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,759
and so l know.

1180
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,311
Before, l just wasn't used to it
but now...

1181
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:22,915
l love you, like.

1182
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,191
Let's just be friends.

1183
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,630
Coming?

1184
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,714
You're crying? He's crying.

1185
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,239
The big baby!

1186
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,192
Only babies cry, dude.

1187
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,911
You're not a baby, ok.

1188
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:21,995
Next!

1189
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,389
Here, honey.

1190
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,989
Thanks, Mum.

1191
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:43,710
- Who are you?
- Your loyal wife, Sire.

1192
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,036
Swear! Damn yourself in fear!

1193
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,194
Bitch...

1194
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,598
<i>The Greatest No-Global Poems</i>

1195
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,560
No, l said no less than 650,000.

1196
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,473
l'll call you back.

1197
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:14,955
Aurore?

1198
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:16,836
Hervé...

1199
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,150
lt's been ages. What's new?

1200
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,033
As you see, l sell shoes here.

1201
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,155
And you?

1202
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,995
l'm in real estate.

1203
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:32,315
And so l suggest meeting for lunch
near where she works.

1204
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,795
We'll have gone our separate ways

1205
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,754
and then meet up. We leave our lives
and get back together.

1206
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:40,354
We start over.

1207
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,550
- What d'you think?
- l'm texting someone.

1208
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,718
No mobiles in the car.
You'll get brain tumours.

1209
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,036
Mobiles are really dangerous.

1210
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,634
Cut it out.

1211
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,149
You heard her.

1212
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,110
Don't stop at the gate.
Keep driving.

1213
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:05,635
Pain in the ass.

1214
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,869
Kissy!

1215
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,997
Toe the line, ok.

1216
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,469
Wait outside at 5.
Even if we're late, just wait.

1217
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:31,955
See you, kid!

1218
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:44,950
Hi.

1219
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:51,829
How's it going?
