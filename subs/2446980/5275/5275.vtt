1
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,448
Ferg, it's me, Frankie.

2
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,744
Listen, I'm leaving messages
on your phone.

3
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:53,663
I need to talk to you tonight.
It's about midnight your time, now.

4
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,808
Phone me back when you get in.

5
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,913
Fergus, it's me. Listen, lad -
I need to speak to you.

6
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:08,206
I need to speak to you tonight.
Fuckin' phone me back, will you?

7
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,574
It's all gone fuckin' wrong, here.
I need to...

8
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,448
Where the fuck have you gone, eh?

9
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:22,496
On the fuckin' piss?
I need to talk to you tonight! Now!

10
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:34,212
ROUTE IRISH

11
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:13,750
To the front! Go, go, go!

12
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,123
So where we going, then?

13
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,992
- Fuck knows. Africa?
- Africa?

14
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,831
I was thinking somewhere like France.

15
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:41,531
France? It's too close.
What about... Brazil?

16
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,032
Or Australia.

17
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,907
Australia. That's good, that.

18
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,540
- How about lndia?
- India?

19
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,579
India. Still somewhere to go,
isn't it? It's far away.

20
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,332
- New Zealand?
- New Zealand.

21
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,831
Doesn't appeal to me.

22
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,866
It's right by Australia.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,197
I've just decided.
I'm going to Australia.

24
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,824
Rachel.

25
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,490
I need to see him.

26
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,074
Frankie. I need to see him.

27
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,540
I'm really sorry, sir.

28
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:20,080
Even his family haven't seen him.
The coffin's been sealed.

29
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,869
Yeah, I know.

30
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,411
Let them all go. I'll see him then.

31
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:28,500
No, I don't think you do understand.

32
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:32,197
You see, the coffin's been sealed,
because the body...

33
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:36,121
Well, the deceased
was very badly injured.

34
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,162
Very badly injured,
and he's not complete.

35
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,365
Frankie...

36
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,703
They gave you a fuckin' tie...

37
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,082
He hated fuckin' ties.

38
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,498
Get it off.

39
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:12,159
What have they done to you? Eh?

40
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:14,328
What have they done?

41
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,664
Where's your hand?

42
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,908
At least I recognise your hand.

43
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:33,866
With Frankie, you learned always...
to expect the unexpected.

44
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:42,197
But that could never hide
what a terrific soldier he was.

45
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:48,122
Courageous, loyal, funny.

46
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,617
Tough as nails, but always fair.

47
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,290
And I'm here today to tell you...
that Frankie, the man,

48
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,035
didn't change when he left the army,
and came to work with us at Tyree.

49
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:06,535
The skills he learned as a soldier
were used to protect engineers,

50
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,282
bringing water and electricity

51
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:10,658
to the long-suffering people of Baghdad,

52
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:15,741
to protect doctors, surgeons,
experts in child nutrition,

53
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,572
journalists, electoral advisors.

54
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,074
He was a protector,

55
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,790
a nation-builder,

56
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:27,329
a force for good.

57
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,450
And I'm ashamed
to have to say this, but...

58
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,575
there are no memorials
in this country to men like Frankie.

59
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,245
No Union Jacks,

60
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:42,664
no guards of honour, no sympathetic
words from politicians.

61
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:46,080
In fact, precious little respect at all.

62
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:51,123
In my book, these men
are the unsung heroes of our time.

63
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,956
Patriots,

64
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,948
soldiers for peace.

65
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:01,160
And to Rachel, and Frankie's family...

66
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,199
I want to say it was a privilege

67
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,405
to have known this true giant of a man.

68
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,697
He was desperate to speak to you.
Where were you?

69
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,160
I fucked up.

70
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:39,533
I got in a fight.

71
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,909
Two bouncers taking the piss
out of Craig cos he's blind.

72
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:45,749
I told them it happened in Baghdad,
they don't give a fuck.

73
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,618
They ended up in hospital,
I ended up in a police cell.

74
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,702
Why don't you come back
with me to Ibiza for a while?

75
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,280
Huh? No drink, no drugs.

76
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:01,282
They've got me passport.

77
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,040
Listen, when this case is over,
I'll come. I promise you.

78
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,249
- You promise me!
- I promise.

79
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,748
Jamie gave me this.

80
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,618
He came to visit me...
but it came from Frankie.

81
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,575
It has this little note attached.

82
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,411
"Dear Marisol,
please keep this safe for me.

83
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:31,864
"If you see Fergus first, please
give it to him - nobody else.

84
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,370
"Got to rush.
Can't wait to see you, love.

85
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,706
"Frankie."

86
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,871
We don't know everything that happened,

87
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,618
but we have a pretty clear idea
of how it unfolded.

88
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,365
We have some documents here,

89
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,991
which you may want to look over later.

90
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,617
On the 17th of September,
they was on Route Irish...

91
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,490
Sorry... Route Irish?

92
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,581
Route Irish is...

93
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:02,530
It's a codename for the road from
Baghdad airport to the Green Zone.

94
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:05,955
They were on their way to pick up
a Spanish journalist from the BIAP -

95
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,493
the Baghdad International Airport.

96
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,206
His name?

97
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,120
His name was Sergio Perez Minguez.

98
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,573
Which paper?

99
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,620
- Does it really matter?
- Yeah.

100
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,207
Just asking a few questions. It matters.

101
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,369
The paper was El País.

102
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,245
Frankie and three contractors
were ambushed

103
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,573
approximately two kilometres
from the airport by terrorists.

104
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,666
There are no direct
eyewitnesses as such,

105
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:35,657
but we do have signed statements,

106
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:38,158
from another company
of passing contractors,

107
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:41,125
who passed by
within minutes of the incident.

108
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,322
They said the vehicle was in flames,
and it had been immobilised.

109
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,245
So the vehicle -
was it soft-skinned or armoured?

110
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:51,448
It was one of our new fleet.
Just came up from Kuwait.

111
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:55,121
- It was armoured, Fergus.
- Do you have a photograph?

112
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,037
We thought that kind of material
would be a little upsetting,

113
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,032
on a day like this, Fergus.

114
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:03,409
But we can have a copy
sent to you, Rachel, if you want.

115
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,032
Yeah.

116
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:09,455
One of the contractors from the
other company recognised Frankie,

117
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:14,031
who was lying outside
of the vehicle, beside the road.

118
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:17,614
That's when he pulled to a halt,
tried to stabilise him,

119
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,332
and evacuated him to the CSH,
which is the...

120
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,119
What was his name? Which company?

121
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,037
Fergus, will you do me a favour,
mate? Just let...

122
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,658
He's got a right to ask questions.

123
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:30,659
He's part of this family,
as far as I'm concerned.

124
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:34,489
All I'm doing is trying to get to
the bottom of what happened.

125
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,955
I think it's important
that you all understand

126
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:43,452
that Route Irish is the most
dangerous road in the world.

127
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,079
I'm very sorry, but they were just...

128
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,824
in the wrong place, at the wrong time.

129
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:53,701
"The wrong place,
at the wrong time"? No.

130
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,824
No fucking way. Not Frankie.

131
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,449
Frankie was never in the wrong place,

132
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,074
at the wrong fucking time!

133
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,494
You don't fucking understand, do you?

134
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:08,499
He was born lucky. He was born lucky.

135
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,661
- Fergus, fucking hell, mate...
- Sit down!

136
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:13,249
Fucking get out,
before I lose me temper!

137
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,161
All right, I'm going, I'm going.

138
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:16,748
Sit down, Andy.

139
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,116
- He was born lucky.
- I'm sorry.

140
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,662
- So sorry about this.
- It's OK.

141
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:27,283
Don't be sorry. Look...

142
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:30,284
Those boys were like brothers.
They went to school together.

143
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,203
They grew up as brothers, he's just...

144
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,618
He's lost the fuckin' plot.

145
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,947
Does he... ever see his family?

146
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,324
His mother more or less
deserted him, got remarried

147
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,994
and went to London.

148
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,492
Basically, the only family he's ever
known has been Frankie and us.

149
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,490
He's a good man.

150
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,786
Thanks, Andrew.

151
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,449
These are all for you, Rachel.

152
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,407
There is one small thing.

153
00:12:56,917 --> 00:13:00,705
Frankie borrowed a mobile phone
from an Iraqi driver,

154
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,370
and never had time
to hand it back to him.

155
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,491
The driver lost his son a week later,

156
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,116
and he had some photographs
on that phone.

157
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,949
So for sentimental reasons, we're
trying to get it returned to him.

158
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:17,829
God, that's really terrible.
Sorry, he didn't mention it.

159
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,574
- Look at that. Have you seen that?
- What?

160
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,448
That fucking cunt over there.

161
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,416
- Fucking Haynes.
- What's going on?

162
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:44,614
It's fuckin' Haynes, giving out
his card. He's fucking recruiting.

163
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,163
He's fucking recruiting people
at Frankie's funeral.

164
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:51,079
- Fuckin' hell.
- He's going over.

165
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:53,373
Fucking cunt.

166
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,905
Giving out your fucking card
at Frankie's funeral!

167
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:59,203
Fucking cunt!

168
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,914
You fucking scumbag!

169
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:02,373
You fucking toerag!

170
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,912
We approached him.

171
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:07,909
It's a wake.
We approached him. Calm down.

172
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:10,909
- Have a bit of respect.
- Just remember where you are.

173
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:13,374
- Calm down, Fergus.
- Let me go!

174
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:16,453
I'm all right, I'm all right.

175
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,036
Hey, it's me.

176
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,624
Give us a bell. Suppose
you're on the piss, aren 't you?

177
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,822
Give us a bell when you're back. Ta-ra.

178
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,120
Hey, slaphead, it's me.

179
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,572
I left a message on your mobile.
Listen, phone me back.

180
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,165
Phone me back tonight.
Speak to you in a bit.

181
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:06,157
Fergus, me back's against the wall.
I've got no one to turn to.

182
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:11,207
Where the fuckin' hell are you?
Answer your fuckin ' phone!

183
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,708
I've got to deliver this
notice for a non-payment of gas.

184
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,905
Turn up at this house,
the woman comes out the kitchen.

185
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:23,158
This fuckin'... You know?

186
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,453
I said, "Look, I've just got to..."

187
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,996
And I give her this thing.
I said, "It's from the Gas.

188
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,788
"Non-payment of bills.
I've got to serve you this notice."

189
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,828
She went, "Fuck off..."

190
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,032
Next thing, she goes to the back door -
to what I thought was the garden -

191
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,907
opens the door.

192
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,782
Fucking dog.

193
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:47,239
Fucking head on this dog...
like that, honest to God.

194
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,663
Fuckin'... big American fuckin' thing.

195
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,579
- You know these dogs...
- I know exactly what you mean.

196
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,495
- Pit bull, innit?
- This fuckin' thing was like that.

197
00:16:56,625 --> 00:17:00,664
Chasing me down...
fuckin' chasing me down the road!

198
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,996
- He hasn't had a go at you, has he?
- Fuckin' look at that.

199
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,490
Fucking hell, mate!

200
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,956
Aye, aye!

201
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,699
Have a look at his arse!

202
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,075
Didn't know the Chippendales
were coming in, did you?

203
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,324
Eh?

204
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,698
Fuckin' hell...

205
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,371
I'd get me arse bit every day,
if could have a bop at that.

206
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,990
Fuckin' hanging off me arse!

207
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,707
Fuck this. What are you doing this for?

208
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,664
Honestly. Seriously.

209
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,373
Cos I like animals!

210
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,075
No, joking aside,
why don't you come with me to Iraq?

211
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,746
- Ah, no, lad. I've told you...
- Join the circuit with me.

212
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:42,864
No, lad. I said to her, I'm staying.

213
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,367
- This won't last forever.
- Listen to me, look.

214
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,456
Ten grand a month, I'm getting.

215
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,039
Fuck off.

216
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,532
Ten grand a month. Tax free.

217
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,908
And you've been? Ten grand a month?

218
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,873
Ten grand a month, tax free.

219
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,366
One phone call, you could be with me.

220
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,365
On my fuckin' team.

221
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,530
What d'you think?

222
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:11,405
300, two unknown bravos,
left side of road.

223
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,495
500, abandoned vehicle, right side.

224
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,032
Approaching position.

225
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,540
400, stationary vehicle, left side.

226
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,789
RPG left!

227
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,078
Move right!

228
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,540
- Go right!
- Go right!

229
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,077
Come on!

230
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,698
Go, go!

231
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:44,873
What are you doing?

232
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:47,657
Frankie! Frankie!

233
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,790
Fergus! Move!

234
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,623
Move, Fergus, move!

235
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,120
- Thanks, mate.
- Where's Brett?

236
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,332
He's fuckin' gone, mate.

237
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,700
I started sorting
through Frankie's things.

238
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,324
Didn't realise how much stuff he's got.

239
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,369
- There you go.
- Thanks.

240
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,207
Stuff arrived from Iraq.

241
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:47,280
I don't know what's wrong with me -
I found these on the top,

242
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,782
and I couldn't carry on.

243
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:51,283
This was a week after you introduced us.

244
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,328
That half-marathon.

245
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,780
My knee was playing up,
but I really wanted to finish,

246
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:59,750
and he walked
the last three miles with me.

247
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,582
He had this one
on his wall, above his bunk.

248
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,573
- Did he?
- Yeah.

249
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:13,873
I didn't realise there were so...

250
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,323
many photos.

251
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,450
- There's loads of you.
- Let's have a look.

252
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,199
I remember that day.

253
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,789
I remember that.

254
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,499
Frankie looks really happy
in that one.

255
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,616
I've never even looked at these before.

256
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,955
I used to pretend
you were both still in Belize,

257
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,823
in the Caribbean, you know.

258
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,369
Not at war.

259
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,950
If it came on the telly,
I'd just switch it off.

260
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,701
He'd do anything for me,
and I wasn't there for him.

261
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:57,122
I never asked him once
how it was... how he was.

262
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,117
Not once, Fergus, can you believe that?

263
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:03,157
Now, I've got his ashes.

264
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:06,204
Why are you doing this?
Why are you punishing yourself?

265
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,995
Rachel, he loved you so much,
you know that.

266
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,581
Don't do this.

267
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,699
I don't know what to with them.

268
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:20,453
Would you like me to take them?

269
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,289
What did you say?

270
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,706
Would you like me to take them?

271
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:34,159
He's dead, Fergus.

272
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:36,873
You're still clinging on.

273
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,740
Look, I'm sorry.

274
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:42,743
I'm sorry... I didn't think you'd mind.

275
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,740
Oh, I wouldn't mind.

276
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,661
Like I wouldn't mind him going to Iraq!

277
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,453
He only went there because of you,

278
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:51,120
and even now, you want
to take him away from me.

279
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,162
Sometimes I fucking hate you, Fergus.

280
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:55,407
Listen, I'd better go.

281
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:59,535
- Who was that woman in the church?
- What?

282
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:02,500
The woman, at the back of the church.

283
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,331
Who was she?

284
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:08,784
- What woman?
- You know what woman.

285
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,457
Oh, look... She"s from lbiza.

286
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,243
A lot of the single lads go there.
It's a way of coming down.

287
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,490
It's no big thing.

288
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,788
Every fuckin' day out there
could be your last.

289
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:24,784
You try going from that
to shopping at Tesco's.

290
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:25,906
That's all it is.

291
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:28,408
OK, what was her name?

292
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:29,577
Why?

293
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,495
"Why"? I want to know.
What was her name?

294
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,913
Marisol. Her name was Marisol.
She owned a little bar.

295
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:38,499
We used to go there.
She was kind, patient.

296
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,991
- Once you realised...
- What was she, Fergus?

297
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,912
Was she your girlfriend,
or just a friend?

298
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:47,910
Does it matter, Rachel?
Does it matter what she was to me?

299
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:49,623
- Yeah.
- A bit of both.

300
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,615
- What about Frankie?
- No, no.

301
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,162
Look, Frankie... He was never there.

302
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:57,705
- He never came there.
- "He never came there"?

303
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,165
So you did everything else together,

304
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:02,248
- and he'd never met her?
- No.

305
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,244
You shared her! Just tell me.

306
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,240
Yeah, we fucking shared her!

307
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,332
- I can't believe this!
- We fucking shared her!

308
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:14,905
We shared her. We shared
fucking everything, apart from you!

309
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,572
Got to hit me harder than that,
if you're going to fucking hit me.

310
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,822
Hiya. I've got an appointment
with Harim, the Iraqi musician.

311
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,366
- Room 2, upstairs.
- Room 2, upstairs?

312
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:07,409
That's her mother.
I think she's the birthday girl.

313
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:10,624
And that's her brother.

314
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,206
And... Yeah.

315
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:16,579
There are some video clips.
Do you want to see them?

316
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:20,246
Yeah. Yeah. How many videos did you...

317
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,957
There is two video clips,
and those photographs.

318
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,869
- That was everything on the phone?
- Yeah.

319
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,615
Two videos?

320
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:29,203
The first one.

321
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:32,496
That's the same party,
same birthday cake.

322
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:36,454
The same family from the photographs.

323
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,244
They cut the cake.

324
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,823
lce creams.

325
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:53,036
"Taif" - that's one of the boys.
Her brother's name is Taif.

326
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:54,782
- Taif?
- Yeah.

327
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:57,499
The young boy we saw in the photograph.

328
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:01,953
She was here to live a hundred years,

329
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,539
and that's Taif.

330
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,865
They are happy there.

331
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:12,120
- You want to watch the second one?
- Yeah.

332
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,036
He's asking him to go on the bike.

333
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,789
He wants them to come back.

334
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,911
They hit the taxi.

335
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,786
They killed the family.

336
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:11,366
You've killed a family.

337
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,119
Nelson, you stupid bastard!
You've killed a fucking family!

338
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:30,040
Get down! Get down!

339
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,583
They killed those two boys,
and the family as well.

340
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,241
This is murder.

341
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:47,953
Do you know these men?

342
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:55,118
- No.
- Have you ever been to Iraq?

343
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,740
No.

344
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,957
Have you heard of Order 17?

345
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,495
Gives these mercenaries
freedom to act like cowboys.

346
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,115
Total immunity.

347
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,322
They charge through our country,
killing who they want.

348
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,699
No question asked.

349
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:14,370
We detest them
even more than the army.

350
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,949
Who are you?

351
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,039
I told you...

352
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:23,239
I'm a researcher,
working for a journalist.

353
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,620
I'm just trying to find out
what happened here.

354
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,241
Who owned the phone, anything about him.

355
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:34,994
I need you to go into the phone,
get all the text messages,

356
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,740
voicemails, contacts...

357
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:39,207
Just translate everything on the phone.

358
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,950
Look, I'll pay you. I'll pay you well.

359
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,493
I'll pay you £ 700.

360
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,367
What's to stop me copying this
and putting it on the internet?

361
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,740
There's no point.

362
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:53,447
If you do that, you'll jeopardise
the whole investigation.

363
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,699
These contractors
know what they're doing.

364
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,700
They'll close ranks,
they'll falsify records.

365
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:01,074
They'll have
the best lawyers in the country.

366
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,745
Right now, they don't
even know this phone exists.

367
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:08,665
They kill people all the time.
Why are you interested in this case?

368
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,290
The contractor that ran to the taxi -

369
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:18,956
he died ten days ago, and I think
the company that employed him...

370
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,699
I think they're lying,
they're hiding something.

371
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:24,700
- Ah... That's why you care about this.
- It's not...

372
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,414
- How about the Iraqis?
- Listen...

373
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:28,498
Do they count? Do you care about them?

374
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:33,073
Of course, now listen to me.
Does this video have a date on it?

375
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,286
First of September.

376
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:43,578
- That's four weeks ago.
- Exactly.

377
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,908
Why should I trust you?

378
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:49,373
You shouldn't trust anyone.

379
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,748
Oh!

380
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,582
That's a fucking red card, that, ref!

381
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:30,947
Great! Yeah!

382
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:35,283
Penalty!

383
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,408
Don't miss it, you soft twat!

384
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:47,078
Shut up you, you prick.

385
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,706
Frankie called you, yeah?

386
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,370
Yeah, he called me about three times.

387
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,491
He was looking for you,
and he weren 't happy.

388
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:10,035
He was proper fuming.

389
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:12,829
Did he mention Nelson?

390
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,869
Was that that wophead in Baghdad, is it?

391
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,036
- Yeah, Nelson.
- Yeah, he mentioned him,

392
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,783
and them two, that were at the funeral.

393
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:21,532
- Haynes and Walker.
- Yeah. He mentioned them.

394
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:25,034
What did he say about them?
Anything specific?

395
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:27,249
No, nothing. He was just like,
"Where's Fergus?

396
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,616
"They're fucking doing me head in,"
things like that.

397
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,207
He didn't have a good word
to say about them.

398
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,493
He just wanted you.

399
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:37,197
Can you remember the date?
Was it September the first?

400
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:40,200
I remember it being
after you done them doormen in.

401
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,790
- Was it a Saturday?
- D'you know what, it was.

402
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:45,124
You were meant to come round
to watch the Everton game.

403
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,332
What's going on, lad?

404
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,322
Dunno, mate. Something's not right.

405
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,449
Come on, tell me.
You got to fuckin' help me.

406
00:31:56,583 --> 00:32:00,451
You're the only one I trust.
You gonna help me, or what?

407
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:03,996
Listen to me, you've got
to fuckin' help me, OK?

408
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,616
Can you not just come out here yourself?

409
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,366
You think if I could,
I wouldn't already be there?

410
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,788
I can't come out, they've taken me
passport. I've got this court case.

411
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:16,034
Tommy, you're in and out
of the office all the time.

412
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,533
Just check for me...

413
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:20,953
Check the incident reports,
first of September.

414
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,495
Shooting on a taxi.

415
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:26,287
Listen, if they find out
they'll go fucking spare.

416
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:27,907
I understand that.

417
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:31,955
I need you to find anything out,
any handwritten notes,

418
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,914
scan them, send them over.

419
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:37,614
I need to know who was in
the vehicle with Frankie and Nelson.

420
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:41,572
I need names, numbers.
Frankie was really upset that night.

421
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,994
Talk to Peggy, in the bar.
They were close.

422
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,740
She might know something.

423
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:48,332
And I need to find Jamie,
the mechanic. You know Jamie?

424
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:52,246
Jamie's in Afghanistan.
He's gone now.

425
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:57,074
Well get me a number, any kind
of contact for him, if you can.

426
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:01,701
Listen to me, that fuckin' Nelson,
is he still out there?

427
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,661
Yeah, he's fucking here.

428
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,869
When's he coming home? I need to know.

429
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,822
- That's all I'm asking.
- Hold on a minute, Fergus.

430
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:16,031
I'm not getting involved wi' Nelson,
cos the man's a fucking savage.

431
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:18,123
All right? I'm not even having a laugh.

432
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,452
We're talking about my job.
I've got three fucking...

433
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:22,573
Talking about...?

434
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:26,951
Listen, I appreciate you've got kids,
but talking about your fucking job?

435
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,573
"Talking about your job"

436
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:31,074
Have you got a short memory
or something?

437
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:34,450
We fuckin' owe Frankie, both of us.
You fuckin' know that.

438
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,661
What were the dates?

439
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,456
Well, you kept this quiet.

440
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,207
How long have you been here?

441
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:53,330
Months. Lost track.

442
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,871
And it's still empty? What's that about?

443
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,365
Didn't know where to start.

444
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:07,575
So you just curl up in a corner?

445
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,369
It's what you want.

446
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:22,157
Some of Frankie's ashes.

447
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:32,030
It's only right. If he wasn't
with you, he was talking about you.

448
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:42,746
To be honest... I was jealous.

449
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:46,116
I realised that...

450
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:51,578
he didn't really go
to Iraq for the money.

451
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:54,324
He went to be with you.

452
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:56,574
Ah, come on, Rachel. That's daft.

453
00:35:58,292 --> 00:36:01,409
- I think he loved you.
- Fuck off, Rachel.

454
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:06,372
Here.

455
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,207
I think it was just
going through his stuff,

456
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:18,700
I realised that maybe I didn't know him.

457
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,617
No, Rachel, that's wrong.
You did, you knew him.

458
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:28,831
You knew the best part of him,
without a gun in his hand.

459
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:34,614
Did you find his mobile?
Was there any messages?

460
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,832
Yeah, there was a few.
Nothing important.

461
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:39,290
- What about his laptop?
- Think it's broken.

462
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:41,282
It rattled when I picked it up.

463
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,663
- Did you check his e-mail?
- I don't know his password.

464
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,782
I bet you do, don't you?

465
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:54,790
Are you going to tell me, Fergus?

466
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:03,373
Six letters.

467
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:07,702
"Rachel"

468
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:13,368
Same tattoo as Frankie.
What is it with you two?

469
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,283
Can you give me the statement
that Haynes sent you?

470
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:19,657
Yeah, course I can.

471
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:22,659
Did he send any photos
of the burnt-out vehicle?

472
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:26,660
No, not yet.
But the contractor who found them...

473
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,115
He sent these of the vehicle.

474
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,207
They're fucking horrible, Fergus.

475
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,290
There, there, there.

476
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:02,533
Oh yes! Oh, yes! The y're gonna get it.

477
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:09,790
Yes, naughty little boys.

478
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,619
Yes!

479
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:22,997
Yes. Yes... Yes.

480
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,242
Right, gone out of range on it. Roger.

481
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,824
Got him. Good. Second one.
Hit the other one.

482
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:45,495
Go right, see if anyone's
moved by the truck.

483
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,035
Right, store that.

484
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:49,123
There's a guy who moved, right there.

485
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,239
Hit him.

486
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,038
When I was in the SAS,

487
00:40:56,167 --> 00:41:00,160
we used to do
joint operations with the US.

488
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,116
Special Forces.

489
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,868
"The hunt for terrorists"?
Load of fucking bollocks.

490
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,241
Chicken farmers, mostly, these people.

491
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,115
You'd go in, and...

492
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,083
you grabbed them, and you cuffed them.

493
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,073
Put their hands behind their back.

494
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:23,041
And their fucking wrists
would blow up like balloons.

495
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:25,078
They'd be pissing themselves,
shitting themselves,

496
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:29,030
children screaming, women screaming...

497
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:32,749
One night we did eleven houses in a row.

498
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:35,662
Eleven fucking houses - we got nothing.

499
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:38,909
Eleven houses...
And you know, the one thing...

500
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:42,284
it's ironic, but if they didn't
support Al Qaeda before,

501
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,159
then they did after,
I can guarantee you that.

502
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:49,405
And the fuckin' Yanks...
the Yanks would torture them.

503
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:52,124
Fuckin' torture them!

504
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,115
What did they do?

505
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:58,125
One time, I saw this guy
being interrogated.

506
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,161
They used an electric prod on him.

507
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:02,874
They half-drowned him
in a swimming pool.

508
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,162
But what can you do?
They had this motto -

509
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:08,123
"No blood, no foul."

510
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:11,158
What does that mean?

511
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:14,079
Means if they don't fuckin' bleed,
you've done nothing wrong.

512
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,241
- Want another drink?
- Yeah.

513
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:25,197
Hi, love. Pint of lager
and a vodka and tonic, please.

514
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,783
Room clear! One bravo!

515
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,949
Move away! Tell them.

516
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:40,450
Stand away! Move out the fucking way.

517
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,915
Come on, let's get that kid out!

518
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,749
- Get the kid.
- He's taking too long!

519
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:54,079
- Get out!
- Get out the way, I'll get him.

520
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:56,244
Get outside,
you stupid fuckin' rag-head!

521
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:01,490
They had this orchard. They wouldn't
give any information, right?

522
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:05,447
So the Americans threatened them,
to flatten the orchard.

523
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:11,665
So this woman, she's fuckin'
hangin' on to this tree,

524
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:14,329
cos that's her fuckin' life.

525
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:18,531
She's holding on to this tree.
She's not gonna move.

526
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:22,239
So they order this young soldier -
young black kid -

527
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,957
to go in, get her out.

528
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:28,405
But he's nearly fuckin' breaking
her arm, she's struggling so much.

529
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:32,455
The fucking tanks go in,
roots get torn up...

530
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:36,746
This kid's standing there,
he's trying hide his tears.

531
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:42,117
And the thing that got me
more than anything is...

532
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,322
they're fuckin' playing jazz music
on the speakers.

533
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,908
On the tanks, there's jazz music.

534
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:54,697
So I left. I got out the Residents,
that was it.

535
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:59,994
But you didn't get out, did you?

536
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:01,706
You joined up with Haynes.

537
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,207
- You were still there.
- Because Haynes...

538
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:08,040
It was me last chance...
at a big payday.

539
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:12,285
Why did you go on your own,
if it were that good?

540
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:16,035
Cos I wanted my own firm.

541
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:18,704
I wanted a piece for meself.
And why not?

542
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:22,155
And you know what?
Haynes was fucking furious.

543
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:25,364
He couldn't get it in his head,
how a scruff like me -

544
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,207
from fuckin' here - a scruff like me,

545
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:31,120
had an eye for the fuckin'
main chance, as fast as him.

546
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:39,286
What happened, Fergus?

547
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:50,497
I lost three of my lads
in an ambush. Good lads.

548
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:54,290
Got the client out. The golden rule -

549
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:56,954
"The package always comes first."

550
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,412
I left the lads behind.

551
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:03,874
We never did that in the army.

552
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:09,073
I thought I was OK, then I got
a letter from one of the mothers.

553
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:15,244
Things just started falling apart.

554
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:22,782
Slap me.

555
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,911
Come on, Rachel. Slap me.

556
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,373
Come on.

557
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,414
Harder.

558
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:35,872
Harder.

559
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:48,949
Punch me.

560
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,286
I was in the archives. Donald came in.

561
00:48:17,417 --> 00:48:20,580
- I had to drop it.
- He's still out there, is he?

562
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:22,619
Aye, he's a fuckin' arse.

563
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:26,993
Well listen...
did you manage to get anything?

564
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:31,332
The first of September,
tell me what you found.

565
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:35,824
Well, there's nothing happened,
by all accounts.

566
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:39,405
"There's nothing fuckin' happened"?
They shot up a fuckin' taxi!

567
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,705
Well, there's fuck all
in the record about it,

568
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,619
cos I've checked everything.

569
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,206
So...

570
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:50,155
Did you find out who was
on duty with Frankie that day?

571
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:53,659
- Nelson.
- Nelson? Well, that ties up.

572
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,741
And three Colombian guys, as well.

573
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:59,992
Three Colombian guys?
Did you get their names?

574
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,865
Nah, never heard of them.

575
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,164
Look, I need you to get
the fuckin' names, mate.

576
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:09,784
Just get them, and text me with them
as soon as you've got them.

577
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:13,207
What about Jamie? Any word on Jamie?

578
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:17,406
He's in Afghanistan, up some
fuckin' mountain, fixing Jeeps.

579
00:49:17,542 --> 00:49:18,367
- For fuck's sake.
- Look,

580
00:49:18,396 --> 00:49:20,534
I'll try to get a message to him.

581
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,248
Best I can do, man.

582
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:25,617
I appreciate your help,
and I won't forget this.

583
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,331
I won't forget.

584
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:31,326
Right, see you later.

585
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:33,119
Who was that?

586
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,916
Tommy, a contractor in Baghdad.

587
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:39,828
Who's Jamie?

588
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:43,997
Jamie's an old mate from army days.
A mechanic.

589
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:48,869
And what did you mean, when you said
someone shot up a taxi?

590
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,490
Look...

591
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:56,030
Something happened out there.
Something really bad.

592
00:49:57,167 --> 00:50:01,115
First of September,
two weeks before Frankie died.

593
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,159
There's someone I want you to meet.
An Iraqi musician.

594
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:09,329
Has it got something to do with Frankie?

595
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:11,619
I want to know
what's going on, Fergus.

596
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:14,698
I don't know, myself.

597
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:17,165
But I tell you what,
I'm going to find out.

598
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:22,457
This song is from Mesopotamia -

599
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:25,370
which means
"The land between the two rivers" -

600
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,082
the Tigris and the Euphrates,

601
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:31,496
where the homo sapiens
learned to write, to count,

602
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:33,081
and mark the stars.

603
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:37,201
Which anthropologists call
"The Cradle of Civilisations".

604
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:41,871
In my dreams, it may be once again.

605
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:23,035
That's one of the children,
shouting Taif's name.

606
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,115
"Taif is somewhere, here."

607
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:33,907
Oh, Frankie.

608
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:40,533
You've killed a family!

609
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:43,620
- Nelson, you stupid bastard!
- They're all dead.

610
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,536
You've killed a fuckin' family!

611
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:48,625
Frank, get back in the fucking van!

612
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,787
You've killed a fucking family!

613
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,662
Fucking get in the van. Get in!

614
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:00,623
Fuck's sake...

615
00:53:01,042 --> 00:53:02,907
Just get in!

616
00:53:11,417 --> 00:53:13,954
There are several messages
you should hear, as well.

617
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:22,407
"Taif. Ranj.
Answer me please. Where are you?

618
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:25,614
"Why you went out? You didn't tell me.

619
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:29,038
"Who's listening to me?
Where are you now?

620
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:32,575
"I don't have anything else
without them.

621
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:37,450
"Please, they're both clever boys,
they haven't done anyone.

622
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:40,655
"Please, don't touch my boys.

623
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:42,703
"I'll be your servant.

624
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:47,327
"I'll sell my car, I'll sell my house,
give you anything you ask me."

625
00:53:57,958 --> 00:54:00,950
"They are only my sons,
they are my only sons."

626
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,033
Rachel!

627
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:11,039
Rachel.

628
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:14,206
Rachel, wait.

629
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:21,698
Rachel!

630
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:24,745
Look, you don't understand.

631
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,115
Look at Craig -

632
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:32,038
ordered to shoot, hesitates cos
he think she's seen a kid in the car.

633
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:35,614
Bang! Blinded for life.
What about Jason?

634
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,286
No fucking legs!

635
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:39,908
Half a gut, can't even wipe
his own fuckin' arse!

636
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:42,124
It's split-second decisions.

637
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,912
- You saw that film!
- It's fuckin" us or them!

638
00:54:45,042 --> 00:54:46,703
What about that little boy?

639
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:48,869
He had a mobile, he didn't have a gun.

640
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,117
Oh, come on! What d'you think
they use to set off the I EDs?

641
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,663
- I don't even know what an IED is!
- Improvised explosive device.

642
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,614
It's been fucking killing our lads
for the last three years.

643
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:03,366
Come on, Rachel. Fucking wake up.

644
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,038
Why wasn't there an incident report?
At least four people were killed.

645
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:14,534
To avoid a scandal. They don't
want to get a reputation as cowboys.

646
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:16,999
That could jeopardise
millions' worth of contracts.

647
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:19,161
And what about
those poor people in the taxi?

648
00:55:19,292 --> 00:55:21,658
Come on, there's over
a million people dead.

649
00:55:21,792 --> 00:55:27,332
You think they'd give a flying fuck
about a taxi driver and a nosy kid?

650
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,494
Frankie did. He cared.

651
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:34,413
It's a text message from Tommy.

652
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:37,284
The names of the Colombians
that were on duty with Frankie,

653
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,658
the day they shot up the taxi.

654
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:41,328
Show me.

655
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:48,498
It's the same names.

656
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:52,871
The same three boys that were killed
on the 17th, with Frankie.

657
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:56,578
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

658
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,573
Haynes sent them to me.

659
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:03,165
Fuck. That makes Nelson
the only survivor.

660
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:06,790
- Was it him who shot up the taxi?
- Yeah.

661
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:10,659
I was in the Paras with him,
he's a fuckin' arsehole.

662
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:12,248
I'm going to the police.

663
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:15,867
Wait! What are the police
gonna do in Baghdad?

664
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,740
These bastards will run rings round them.

665
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:21,697
I don't give a shit. I'll go
to the police, the MP, the papers...

666
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:24,495
Just stop. Wait a minute.

667
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:27,947
Remember the Iraqi that was
picked up by the soldiers in Basra?

668
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:29,414
Eh?

669
00:56:29,542 --> 00:56:33,330
93 injuries, beaten to death -
they still got off with it!

670
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:36,825
They closed ranks -
they always have, they always will.

671
00:56:39,042 --> 00:56:41,158
- What can we do?
- Give me more time.

672
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:43,829
Just give me some more time.

673
00:56:48,917 --> 00:56:50,999
Fergus.

674
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:55,448
At the funeral, Walker asked me
about an Iraqi mobile.

675
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:58,450
He said Frankie had borrowed
an Iraqi mobile phone,

676
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:00,574
and he'd forgotten to return it.

677
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:07,249
Fuckin' bastard knew all along.

678
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:23,989
- Think he's going to turn up?
- I know he will. Don't ask why.

679
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:28,456
Put that one on silent.

680
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:36,407
Is it working?

681
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:38,533
Yeah, you're ringing me now.

682
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:42,249
I'll hide that in his car.

683
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,036
Put mine on mute.

684
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:47,783
Sometimes the simplest things
work better.

685
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:51,743
What's that?

686
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,911
It's a tracking device.

687
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:58,330
Nothing fancy,
you just buy it over the counter.

688
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,615
There he is.

689
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:06,030
I mean, this taxi
just got way too close.

690
00:59:07,542 --> 00:59:12,332
Our wagon carried out manoeuvres
right down to the letter.

691
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:14,915
They went from the outside lane
down to the inside lane.

692
00:59:15,042 --> 00:59:16,703
Taxi's still coming.

693
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:18,994
They tried to pull away from the taxi.

694
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:20,706
Taxi was still on his tail.

695
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:24,158
One of the Colombian boys
started screaming at Nelson

696
00:59:24,292 --> 00:59:26,283
to take a warning shot.

697
00:59:26,417 --> 00:59:29,284
Nelson fired a mini-flare.
Taxi kept coming.

698
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:32,909
Nelson fired a shot.
Taxi didn't pull back.

699
00:59:33,042 --> 00:59:36,205
Nelson had no option -
he took the taxi out.

700
00:59:37,417 --> 00:59:39,499
What about Frankie?

701
00:59:41,042 --> 00:59:43,704
Well, Frankie forced the driver
to stop the vehicle.

702
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:45,414
Run back to the taxi.

703
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:48,864
He put his own life at risk,
and the entire team's.

704
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,956
Nelson wanted him sacked.

705
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:54,282
What did you do?

706
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:03,540
I'm risking my career here.

707
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:07,370
I should've went through the channels...

708
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,741
but Frankie was beside himself.

709
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:12,412
Especially about the kids.

710
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:15,079
He suggested compensation.

711
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:19,201
We all agreed. We all chipped in,
and we told no one outside of Iraq.

712
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:23,200
- Did he phone you that night?
- Yeah, he did.

713
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,491
I phoned my wife, too.

714
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,291
I went with Hakim,

715
01:00:31,417 --> 01:00:35,205
found the taxi driver's family,
paid 'em in cash.

716
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:39,747
Found the other people's family...
Hakim organised it all.

717
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:41,957
Maybe you should talk to him first.

718
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:50,242
Hello, it's Walker.
I'm in the UK with Fergus.

719
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:54,243
Fergus Molloy.
He's got a few questions for you.

720
01:00:57,458 --> 01:00:58,823
Hakim?

721
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,616
Have you got a photo
of Frankie's vehicle?

722
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:08,824
I do.

723
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:13,744
We had it towed back to base.

724
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:23,954
It's true. They paid the families.

725
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,742
Frankie was too good for Iraq, Rachel.

726
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:37,370
I've just left them.

727
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:44,072
I think it was OK.
She believed me, that's for sure.

728
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:51,956
No, he wasn 't drinking.
Mineral water, the whole time.

729
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:56,622
Well, he spoke to Hakim.
That was a good fuckin' idea.

730
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:00,572
I don't think they've got the mobile,
or they would've asked more questions.

731
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:04,451
It's best if he gets done and they send
him to prison for a couple of years.

732
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:12,451
Have they given
the green light for the takeover yet?

733
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:14,869
That's ex cellent, Andy.

734
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,538
It's all about you and your contracts.
You know that, don 't you?

735
01:02:18,667 --> 01:02:21,784
Listen, we'll open a couple
of bottles when we meet, yeah?

736
01:02:21,917 --> 01:02:22,997
Take care.

737
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:25,867
- They're bastards, Fergus.
- Too fuckin' right, they are.

738
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:34,369
- Peggy.
- Who's Peggy?

739
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,491
She's got a bar
in the Green Zone in Baghdad.

740
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:39,866
She's got some information.

741
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:45,790
Nelson was smashed.
He was absolutely out of his face.

742
01:02:45,917 --> 01:02:47,782
Started calling Frankie names.

743
01:02:47,917 --> 01:02:52,160
Things like "Goody-two-shoes" this.
"Florence Nightingale" that.

744
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:55,329
"Why don't you shag a rag-head
if you love them that much?"

745
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:58,165
Nelson started going on
about a mobile phone.

746
01:02:58,292 --> 01:03:01,125
What did he say about the mobile?

747
01:03:01,292 --> 01:03:04,614
He were going, "Where's
the fucking mobile, Florence?

748
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,331
"I seen you pick it up."

749
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:08,995
Frankie never said anything.
He still ignored him.

750
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:11,867
Then Nelson grabbed Frankie
by the collar.

751
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,082
"Where's the fucking mobile?"

752
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:19,157
Then Frankie punched him.
He went flying across the tables.

753
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:21,123
Christ knows how he got up again.

754
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:24,385
Then Walker and a few of the lads came in.

755
01:03:24,386 --> 01:03:26,415
What did Walker do?

756
01:03:26,542 --> 01:03:31,161
Walker and the lads dragged him
out of there, screaming blue murder.

757
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:35,489
But here's the thing. That night,
I was cleaning out the toilets,

758
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:37,991
and I seen it wrote on the wall.

759
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:40,457
"Florence, you're a dead girl."

760
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:25,780
I feel close to Frankie out here.

761
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:29,787
We used to skip school,
and get a bottle of Buckfast.

762
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:32,283
Go on the upper deck.

763
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:34,032
Nobody to hassle us.

764
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:40,991
Crossed this ferry every day, Rach.
Back and forth, back and forth.

765
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:48,789
Just trying to catch on to how
it was before, do you know what I mean?

766
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:53,658
Have you opened his e-mails?

767
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:55,453
Yeah.

768
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:57,414
Read them.

769
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:02,869
They weren't meant for me to read.

770
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:07,825
Lots from Marisol.
I can see why you liked her.

771
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:11,951
Not the way he was with me.
He was never like that with me.

772
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:13,869
That's how we are.

773
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:18,161
You'd be amazed at what we can do.

774
01:05:19,792 --> 01:05:24,582
Look, Rachel,
I'm a different person with you

775
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:26,198
than I am with anyone else.

776
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:29,780
When we get off this boat,
I won't be the same as I am now.

777
01:05:29,917 --> 01:05:31,657
You too, Rachel.

778
01:05:31,792 --> 01:05:34,408
He was missing me.
He wanted to come home.

779
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:37,204
He was fed up, hated it.

780
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,746
They sent him to the airport
three times in his last week,

781
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:44,490
and there was no one there.

782
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:47,492
Like a fuckin' shooting gallery.

783
01:05:57,417 --> 01:05:59,999
There was more stuff, Fergus.
Not just that.

784
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:03,447
Mostly, it was about the stuff
with Nelson, the argument.

785
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:06,655
Nelson had said something
at breakfast one morning,

786
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:09,625
and Frankie just couldn't
let go of it. He'd said that...

787
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:12,412
"He was going to go
and get himself a rag-head."

788
01:06:12,542 --> 01:06:15,955
Kill an Iraqi. That's what he meant.

789
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:18,039
He wants to kill an Iraqi.

790
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:23,491
Nelson's mate had been shot in Basra,
the night before, and that's when...

791
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:28,455
Frankie had
a massive argument with that Walker.

792
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:32,701
Nearly came to blows. It was
about Nelson, it was about the taxi.

793
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:36,371
It was all related.
You don't think that they....

794
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,366
You think that they killed Frankie.

795
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:25,040
What you doin' here, Fergus?

796
01:07:31,792 --> 01:07:34,158
"Florence, you're a dead girl."

797
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:37,866
That ring any fuckin' bells, Walker?

798
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:42,039
I didn't lie to you, Fergus.

799
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:44,749
I just didn't want to tell you.

800
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:47,207
I was worried about what you might do.

801
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:52,080
I fired Nelson, but Nelson
threatened to go public -

802
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,242
expose all the details
of what happened in the taxi.

803
01:07:57,583 --> 01:08:00,165
All your precious contracts,
up in smoke.

804
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:02,123
Yeah, basically.

805
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:05,617
I had to eat my words,
and take him back.

806
01:08:13,792 --> 01:08:15,623
Why didn't you just pay him off?

807
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:19,163
Don't you think I tried that?
He just laughed at me.

808
01:08:19,292 --> 01:08:23,114
He loves it out there.
All the gear, the adrenalin.

809
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:27,957
You think it was him that slotted Frankie?

810
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:32,072
Well, Nelson had
a temper on him, for sure.

811
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,449
And he hated Frankie.

812
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:37,655
But I can't honestly see how he done it.

813
01:08:39,625 --> 01:08:44,164
I just think that Frankie was in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

814
01:08:44,292 --> 01:08:46,328
It was Route Irish.

815
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:10,203
Hey! What the fuck's going on?

816
01:09:11,792 --> 01:09:12,827
Come on, then!

817
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,491
Whoa, whoa, stop! Wait!

818
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:18,287
Shh, it's all right. It's all right.

819
01:09:18,417 --> 01:09:20,328
You're just having a bad dream.

820
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:39,156
It's all right, mate. Go back to sleep.

821
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:43,282
Fuckin' Nelson...

822
01:09:44,042 --> 01:09:49,412
I don't know who told him,
but he knew I'd been asking questions.

823
01:09:49,542 --> 01:09:51,783
He come round at night,

824
01:09:53,417 --> 01:09:56,784
kicked my door in,
dragged me out of bed,

825
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:59,950
proceeded to boot
the utter fuckin ' shite out o' me.

826
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:03,530
I wouldn't be so bothered,
but he's broke two of my ribs,

827
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:06,864
and it's a fuckin' nightmare
when you're trying to do the toilet.

828
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,913
Sorry, I'm laughing, but...

829
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:13,499
you look like shit, Tommy.

830
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:19,036
- I got fired.
- Ah, fuck, Tommy, no!

831
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:24,994
Nelson told them I'd been
rooting about in the records.

832
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:26,160
They fired me.

833
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:31,288
I had to tell Nelson,

834
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:34,204
that it was for you that I was looking.

835
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:38,781
Listen to me -
he's on the fuckin' warpath.

836
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:43,280
He knows about you,
and what I've heard is...

837
01:10:43,417 --> 01:10:44,953
he's heading back.

838
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,698
Did you get his address?

839
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:50,290
Yeah, I got his fuckin' address.

840
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:52,703
I'm going to te xt it to you, OK?

841
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:55,540
Listen, he's a fuckin' prick.

842
01:10:56,417 --> 01:10:59,614
Listen, I've come back early.
I've got a serious job on.

843
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:02,787
I need two of your top blokes -
and I mean top blokes.

844
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:06,865
They've got to keep their gobs shut.
It's got to run water-tight, mate.

845
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:11,617
Yeah, excellent. Right, listen -
I'm at the airport now.

846
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,662
Soon as I get meself sorted,
I'll give you a bell back.

847
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:43,625
Fergus. Glad you could make it.

848
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,286
Pleasure.

849
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,619
I was having a coffee. Want something?

850
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:58,031
Even after the merger, I'll still be
at the heart of things. Thank you.

851
01:11:58,167 --> 01:12:00,874
Which means I can hire who I want.

852
01:12:02,417 --> 01:12:04,248
We've got major plans, Fergus.

853
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:07,742
We can go for the meaty stuff,
and leave the dross behind.

854
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:11,697
Our new contacts will give us
access to blue-chip clients,

855
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,573
national governments...

856
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:17,451
In time, we can move from
mine clearance and UXOs

857
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:20,746
to delivering entire
country reconstruction packages.

858
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:23,241
That is the big picture.

859
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:28,575
If I had a battalion-size team
of first-class guys -

860
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:29,993
you know who I mean -

861
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:33,367
we could sort out
somewhere like Darfur.

862
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,957
That's how big we're thinking.

863
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:42,573
Iraq is dust. It's time
to move on to pastures new.

864
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:47,329
And I need men like you, Fergus.

865
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:50,905
Or, if I can be frank - like you were.

866
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:57,614
- Like I was.
- Yeah, one of the best.

867
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,365
Why don't you come back in?

868
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:02,665
If it helps, I...

869
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:05,408
I've got a good guy I see myself,
from time to time.

870
01:13:05,542 --> 01:13:09,330
Not a shrink - an executive counsellor.

871
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,240
What do you say?

872
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:17,246
- What about Nelson?
- Forget it.

873
01:13:18,542 --> 01:13:20,828
He's small fry.

874
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:22,664
Do you think he slotted Frankie?

875
01:13:27,417 --> 01:13:31,114
Nelson said he wanted to
"shoot a rag-head" that day.

876
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:33,866
I believe that. He was an arsehole.

877
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,289
After what happened,
Frankie was convinced it was murder.

878
01:13:38,417 --> 01:13:42,114
The Colombian boys who were with him
said it was a fair call.

879
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,036
What can I say?

880
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:47,204
Nelson said that Frankie had
got hold of a mobile from a witness.

881
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:52,282
Now, that seems a bit far-fetched to me.

882
01:13:52,417 --> 01:13:54,373
If there was a mobile,

883
01:13:55,792 --> 01:13:59,034
and Nelson couldn't get it off him,
then maybe he went for Frankie.

884
01:14:03,042 --> 01:14:05,124
I've asked around, Fergus, believe me.

885
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:12,198
Nelson was tight
with that dodgy driver, with a limp.

886
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:15,291
The one they called Mad Max,
cos of the way he drove.

887
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:16,953
- Remember him?
- Yeah.

888
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:19,039
Ex-police. Corrupt as...

889
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,118
Well, it seems that...
two days before Frankie died,

890
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,993
he and Nelson... spent the day together.

891
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:31,037
- Where?
- Green Zone.

892
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,078
And they left together.

893
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:39,707
Now, we owed that guy
a month's wages - plus bonuses -

894
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:42,074
and we never saw him again.

895
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:43,823
Why was that?

896
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:48,414
Did he do Frankie,

897
01:14:48,542 --> 01:14:50,874
at Nelson's say-so, and get out of town?

898
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:54,784
Maybe he was kidnapped.
Got caught up in a car-bomb.

899
01:14:54,917 --> 01:14:57,499
Maybe he joined his family and children.

900
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,331
In Baghdad, who can say?

901
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,782
Maybe you're right.

902
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:13,039
Maybe Frankie was just in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

903
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:32,573
Oh, my God.

904
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:51,539
Oh!

905
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:06,865
Got it, I've got it.

906
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,582
- Check the bedrooms.
- Where d'you want me?

907
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:15,032
Empty in here, mate.

908
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,789
Empty.

909
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:25,165
Could've hidden it anywhere.

910
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,831
It's fuckin' empty!

911
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:33,864
- You sure this cunt lives in here?
- Just keep checking, mate.

912
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,289
Dave, there's messages.

913
01:16:43,417 --> 01:16:45,499
Put it on loudspeaker, mate.

914
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:49,457
Fergus, it's me again.

915
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:51,790
You need to phone me back, please.
Straightaway.

916
01:16:51,917 --> 01:16:56,240
Someone's got into the flat,
and it's a complete mess.

917
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:58,240
Frankie's ashes are everywhere.

918
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:01,822
Fuckin' hell -
so that's what they were, eh?

919
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:03,949
Where the fuck are you? Bye.

920
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:08,947
'Ello, lad. Only me.
Sick of this fuckin ' voicemail.

921
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:13,156
Oh yeah, by the way, Jamie phoned
and said he needed to see you.

922
01:17:13,292 --> 01:17:15,123
Who the fuck's Jamie?

923
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,787
Give us a bell back when you can.
Catch you later.

924
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:23,448
Hello, hi. This is Harim,
calling for Fergus.

925
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:27,906
I have finished the translations,
including text messages. Call me at...

926
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:30,658
The fuckin dirty-rag bastard -
he's got the mobile!

927
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:33,784
..913 218.
Maybe you could call around to my flat.

928
01:17:33,917 --> 01:17:35,703
Replay that, give us the number.

929
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:37,869
I'll send a text, as if I'm Fergus.

930
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:44,283
All right, get up!

931
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:53,700
Get down, get down! Get in! Get in!

932
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,991
Keep fucking moving, over there.

933
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:03,617
Which one of you bastards is Harim?

934
01:18:04,292 --> 01:18:05,247
Is it you?

935
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:06,956
Oi! Is it you?

936
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:10,199
Fucking tell me!

937
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:12,699
Which bastard's Harim?

938
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:14,414
Fucking look at me.

939
01:18:14,542 --> 01:18:15,782
You'll fucking do.

940
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:19,449
- Get him out!
- Get him on his fucking knees.

941
01:18:20,292 --> 01:18:23,705
It's me, it's me. I am him.

942
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:25,414
Fucking get down.

943
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:31,208
Fucking bastard! Fucking get in.

944
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:33,494
Fucking get in there. Fuck off!

945
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:36,703
Get down!
Get on the rug if you wanna pray.

946
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:55,662
- So he is a bit drowsy.
- Can we talk to him?

947
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:57,783
Yeah, but keep it brief.

948
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,910
- How is he?
- Really messed up.

949
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:05,456
They've broken his arm, he's concussed,
he's got to go to theatre later.

950
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:08,325
She said that we can have
five minutes with him.

951
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:11,655
He has had medication for pain,
so he will be drowsy.

952
01:19:11,792 --> 01:19:14,078
So definitely no more than five minutes.

953
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:18,572
- Did he recognise them?
- No, they were wearing masks and gloves.

954
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:20,573
Nelson just got back.

955
01:19:21,292 --> 01:19:22,532
Thanks.

956
01:19:22,667 --> 01:19:24,123
Nelson?

957
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:35,032
I'm really sorry.

958
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:38,330
I'm really, really sorry
this has happened to you.

959
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:43,538
I tried, but I had
to tell them where it was.

960
01:19:43,667 --> 01:19:45,783
They threatened to hurt Avĩn.

961
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:49,659
I had a copy on the computer.

962
01:19:49,792 --> 01:19:51,578
They smashed that, too.

963
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:54,324
On a disk. They got it all.

964
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:58,905
I should have
put the footage on the net.

965
01:19:59,042 --> 01:20:00,657
I am ashamed of myself.

966
01:20:00,792 --> 01:20:03,033
I needed the money.

967
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,162
I have money. I can give you money.

968
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,617
They always, always get off with it.

969
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,615
That's what makes me mad.

970
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:17,992
I had a chance to show
what they are like.

971
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:22,322
I still have
the mother's name and number.

972
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,412
- Where?
- In my head.

973
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:33,117
You promise to phone her?

974
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:35,912
I give you my word. I promise you.

975
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,333
I know who did this to you.

976
01:20:42,458 --> 01:20:44,824
And I know who killed those boys.

977
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:19,907
Hello, Florence.

978
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:22,624
Get this fucking car
on the motorway, now!

979
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,536
- Get on the fucking motorway!
- Fergus...

980
01:21:24,667 --> 01:21:27,830
Come on, fucking move it,
you fucking shit-house!

981
01:21:27,958 --> 01:21:30,540
- What the fuck you doing?
- What the fuck am I doing?

982
01:21:30,667 --> 01:21:35,206
I'm trying to figure out why all you
fucking wankers like fucking golf!

983
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:37,790
Now get this fucking car started, now!

984
01:22:33,875 --> 01:22:36,287
Fergus, what the fuck are you doing?

985
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:40,116
What the fuck are you doing?

986
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:44,415
Ah, fuck.

987
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:47,454
No blood, no foul.

988
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:51,782
It's up to you.

989
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:55,457
Simple question. Look at me.

990
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,788
- Where's the mobile?
- I don't know what you're on about.

991
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:03,457
You don't know
who smashed up Rachel's flat?

992
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:06,325
What the fuck you on about?
I've just come back from Afghanistan.

993
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:09,245
Just let me go. I promise
you'll never hear from me again.

994
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:12,037
Fergus, I'll just disappear, mate.
Fergus, no!

995
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:13,407
Ferg...!

996
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:22,498
Fuck!

997
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:26,574
- Right, I'll tell you everything.
- So, it does work!

998
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:30,371
I'll tell you everything.
I got the mobile from the Iraqi.

999
01:23:32,042 --> 01:23:34,829
I smashed it to pieces, mate.
I threw it in the river.

1000
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:37,415
Fergus, just a fucking big mistake, this.

1001
01:23:37,542 --> 01:23:38,577
Big mistake?

1002
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:40,915
"Get meself a rag-head" - big mistake?

1003
01:23:41,042 --> 01:23:44,739
For fuck's sake, mate. Danny had
just been slaughtered in Basra...

1004
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:49,414
Me head were in bits. I just
come out with some stupid remark.

1005
01:23:49,542 --> 01:23:51,658
That taxi, mate - it were too close.

1006
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:54,454
I were firing warning shots,
every fucker's in me ear,

1007
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:56,164
shouting, "Take him out, take him out!"

1008
01:23:56,292 --> 01:23:58,704
Fergus, it was too fucking near, mate.

1009
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,994
- Ask Walker.
- What about the boys?

1010
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:03,832
Fuckin' hell, one of them was
running around, waving a mobile.

1011
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:06,290
Looked like he was going
to set off a bomb.

1012
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:09,580
- You'd have done the same!
- So you left 'em to rot.

1013
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:12,541
I didn't leave 'em to rot.
Frankie was off his head.

1014
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:15,784
All Frankie was interested in
was having a fucking investigation.

1015
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:18,989
Fuck me, in Baghdad, against me -
I'd have been fucked!

1016
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:20,990
You've been there,
you'd have done the same.

1017
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:23,741
You've seen it all -
it's another day in Baghdad!

1018
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:25,365
Fuck...

1019
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:30,451
So you and Walker
made his life a fucking misery.

1020
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:33,746
Walker tried reasoning with him,
to try and make him see sense.

1021
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:36,457
But Frankie wouldn't have it.
He weren't for listening.

1022
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:38,915
Then Haynes turned up, he got involved.

1023
01:24:39,042 --> 01:24:42,739
Offered Frankie a load of dough
to shut up, but he wouldn't have it.

1024
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:46,743
Just kept making threats to send
the mobile to this Yankee journalist...

1025
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:48,661
So you took him out?

1026
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:51,659
I was over in Afghanistan, mate.
Doing a recce for Haynes.

1027
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:54,115
- You're a fucking liar.
- I'm not.

1028
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,366
You're a fucking liar!

1029
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:57,615
I'm not!

1030
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:59,866
You're a fucking liar!

1031
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,365
Fuck!

1032
01:25:02,417 --> 01:25:03,623
No!

1033
01:25:05,542 --> 01:25:08,033
Fucking get your head down!

1034
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:26,328
It's all right, come on.

1035
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:29,575
Haynes sent me to Afghanistan
to get me out of the way,

1036
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,539
so he'd have time with...

1037
01:25:33,042 --> 01:25:34,248
Come on.

1038
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:37,447
He sent me over to Afghanistan
to get me out the way.

1039
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:39,494
So he'd have time with Frankie.

1040
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:43,245
Haynes was panicking and flapping.

1041
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:46,492
Cos he didn't want the fucker
blabbing off about the taxi.

1042
01:25:46,625 --> 01:25:50,573
In case it fucked up
his precious fucking contracts.

1043
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:52,994
So Walker started sending him out on...

1044
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:57,241
out on crap jobs and stuff.

1045
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:59,457
Hoping he'd crack up, and just fuck off.

1046
01:25:59,583 --> 01:26:01,824
I fucking swear to you, I wasn't there...

1047
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:04,324
- You're a fucking lying bastard!
- I'm not, mate.

1048
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:08,280
You fucking threatened
to fucking kill him!

1049
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:13,201
- It's bullshit...
- "Florence, you're a dead girl!"

1050
01:26:14,042 --> 01:26:16,624
Peggy's bar, written on the fucking wall.

1051
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,832
Just graffiti...

1052
01:26:31,792 --> 01:26:33,407
Fuck...

1053
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:37,540
I was fucking joking,
it was just graffiti!

1054
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:40,290
- Fuck, haven't you done it?
- Didn't you mean it?

1055
01:26:40,417 --> 01:26:43,329
- No, I didn't!
- You fucking did mean it!

1056
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:46,575
Just like you meant
to fucking beat up Tommy.

1057
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:50,415
You fucking broke the Iraqi's arm!

1058
01:26:50,542 --> 01:26:54,239
You fucking emptied Frankie's ashes
on the fucking floor!

1059
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,240
Didn't do it, mate. Wasn't me.

1060
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:58,331
It wasn't me, Fergus...

1061
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:08,865
Fucking stop it!

1062
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:13,740
It's all right.

1063
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:20,242
I didn't do it, mate.
I was in Afghanistan, I swear.

1064
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:22,832
Fucking ask Haynes. Ask Haynes.

1065
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:24,789
Tell me the fucking truth.

1066
01:27:24,917 --> 01:27:27,875
Fergus, just ask Haynes,
I was in Afghanistan, I swear.

1067
01:27:29,667 --> 01:27:32,955
It was the Iraqi driver, wasn't it?
Mad Max?

1068
01:27:33,917 --> 01:27:36,989
Mate, that's bollocks.
It's fucking bollocks!

1069
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:39,958
- Check with Haynes.
- Haynes fucking told me!

1070
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:45,072
You were with Max two days
before Frankie fucking died!

1071
01:27:45,208 --> 01:27:47,119
I wasn't. That's bullshit.

1072
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:49,582
How much did you pay him?

1073
01:27:49,708 --> 01:27:52,950
Haynes sent me to Afghanistan
to get me out of the way.

1074
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:56,119
No, Fergus, don't...

1075
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:57,786
Fuck off!

1076
01:28:19,167 --> 01:28:22,534
I'll say whatever you want me to say.
Is that what you want?

1077
01:28:22,667 --> 01:28:25,454
- Yeah, I did it.
- How? How did you do it?

1078
01:28:26,625 --> 01:28:28,991
How'd you fuckin' do it? Come on.

1079
01:28:30,167 --> 01:28:32,328
I paid Mad Max 10,000.

1080
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:35,416
- Is that enough?
- No. I want the fuckin' truth.

1081
01:28:39,667 --> 01:28:42,374
- I want the truth, come on.
- I tipped him off.

1082
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,741
I let him know they were
leaving the Green Zone -

1083
01:28:44,875 --> 01:28:46,490
sitting ducks on Route Irish.

1084
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:48,616
Fergus, please, that's enough, mate.

1085
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,331
Just let me go.

1086
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:52,790
- I promise...
- You think that's enough?

1087
01:28:52,917 --> 01:28:54,623
You think that's fucking enough?

1088
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:57,366
- It will fucking never be enough!
- Please, please...

1089
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:02,535
- It'll fucking never be fuckin' enough!
- Please!

1090
01:29:02,667 --> 01:29:03,998
Fergus...

1091
01:29:09,917 --> 01:29:12,533
This one's for you, Frankie!

1092
01:29:12,667 --> 01:29:13,907
Fucking dies!

1093
01:29:14,042 --> 01:29:16,203
He'll never fucking hurt anyone.

1094
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:19,450
This fucking animal will never
hurt anyone ever again!

1095
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:22,871
You fucking hear me, Frankie?
He's a fucking goner!

1096
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,036
Fucking die!

1097
01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:43,282
Tell her...

1098
01:29:43,417 --> 01:29:45,328
"Your sons were shot dead

1099
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:48,370
"by a British contractor,
on the first of September."

1100
01:30:02,583 --> 01:30:05,165
I don't know if it was murder...

1101
01:30:05,292 --> 01:30:07,624
"Are you sure about this?" she says.

1102
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:10,617
..or just standard policy
from a foreign contractor

1103
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,490
who thought his life was in danger.

1104
01:30:14,917 --> 01:30:17,624
They died instantly, and were left
by the side of the road.

1105
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:25,533
The first of September
was a bloody day in Baghdad.

1106
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:27,658
They must have been lost in the chaos.

1107
01:30:37,583 --> 01:30:41,906
"What happened to the man
who killed my sons?" she's asking.

1108
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:43,122
He's dead.

1109
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:50,037
Get her personal details.
I want to help her family,

1110
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:52,203
I want to pay compensation for her sons.

1111
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:04,115
"What compensation? There is nothing...

1112
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,866
"that can compensate my sons.

1113
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,286
"I don't want your compensation."

1114
01:32:02,417 --> 01:32:04,874
It's me.

1115
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,831
Open the door.

1116
01:32:14,167 --> 01:32:18,456
Fergus, I know you're in there.
I saw your car outside.

1117
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:21,536
The neighbour let me in.

1118
01:32:24,042 --> 01:32:27,705
I just want to know you're all right.
I've been worried sick.

1119
01:32:27,833 --> 01:32:30,540
You haven't answered any of our calls.

1120
01:32:31,583 --> 01:32:34,074
Look, I know you're in there.

1121
01:32:35,792 --> 01:32:40,240
You don't even have to speak.
Just let me know that you're OK.

1122
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:41,990
Knock the door.

1123
01:32:49,083 --> 01:32:50,948
Fergus?

1124
01:32:53,667 --> 01:32:57,285
That's it, Fergus.
I just want to know you're OK.

1125
01:32:57,417 --> 01:32:59,533
Now open the door, please.

1126
01:33:00,917 --> 01:33:04,114
Please, just... open the door.

1127
01:33:16,292 --> 01:33:17,873
I, erm...

1128
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,072
I saw Harim this morning.

1129
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:23,915
Yeah, he told me about you
phoning the mother up,

1130
01:33:24,042 --> 01:33:26,624
and I know that must have
taken loads of courage,

1131
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:28,661
and I'm really proud of you.

1132
01:33:31,792 --> 01:33:34,829
Jamie's back from Afghanistan,
and he wants to get hold of you.

1133
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:36,414
He's staying at Craig's.

1134
01:33:36,542 --> 01:33:40,205
So they really want to see you
like I want to see you.

1135
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:48,828
I love you, Fergus.

1136
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:54,914
OK.

1137
01:33:56,625 --> 01:33:59,082
OK.

1138
01:34:33,583 --> 01:34:35,665
The fuckin' look in someone's eyes,

1139
01:34:35,792 --> 01:34:38,579
when they've been
in the same place too long.

1140
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:40,198
Frankie had become so stubborn,

1141
01:34:40,333 --> 01:34:42,415
he wasn 't going to let them
drive him out.

1142
01:34:42,542 --> 01:34:45,784
He was saying shit like,
"I'll go under my own steam,

1143
01:34:45,917 --> 01:34:49,159
"If I'm going to do it,
do it proper", shit like that.

1144
01:34:50,292 --> 01:34:52,157
Sounds like Frankie, doesn't it?

1145
01:34:52,292 --> 01:34:53,907
I thought he was exaggerating.

1146
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:57,534
He'd been sent 14 times to the same
place in the same fuckin' month,

1147
01:34:57,667 --> 01:34:59,999
with those fuckin'...
telephone engineers.

1148
01:35:00,125 --> 01:35:03,993
And if that's true,
that's seriously fucking dangerous.

1149
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:06,662
Up and down Route Irish,
like a fuckin' yo-yo.

1150
01:35:06,792 --> 01:35:08,703
And fuckin' Nelson, man -

1151
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:11,700
Nelson was pickin' on him,
every fuckin' meal-time.

1152
01:35:11,833 --> 01:35:16,657
I swear, if that cunt had a hard-on,
it would've been up Frankie's arse.

1153
01:35:16,792 --> 01:35:20,114
I said to him, "Frankie, look, man.
Just go home."

1154
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:23,742
But he was like, "No. I've got
one last thing to sort out."

1155
01:35:23,875 --> 01:35:27,072
That's when he gave me the phone
and asked me to hide it.

1156
01:35:28,083 --> 01:35:29,619
It's mad, isn't it?

1157
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:34,663
What fuckin' car did he die in?
I hope it wasn't one of mine.

1158
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:36,243
No, it was the...

1159
01:35:36,375 --> 01:35:40,197
one of them armoured Nissan Patrols.
You got the photographs, show him.

1160
01:35:45,833 --> 01:35:48,495
That one, back at the base.

1161
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:50,581
Yeah, it's a Nissan Patrol.

1162
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:54,287
These two are... Route Irish.

1163
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:59,455
Just after it happened.
You can hardly see it cos of the smoke.

1164
01:35:59,583 --> 01:36:03,405
No fuckin' way, man.
That's the dodgy old Hyundai.

1165
01:36:03,542 --> 01:36:07,615
Look, I can see there.
I welded on those plates.

1166
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:10,036
I'd recognise that
in my fuckin' sleep, man.

1167
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:12,783
I must have fixed that engine,
what, a dozen times?

1168
01:36:12,917 --> 01:36:14,953
I fuckin' said to them, man -

1169
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:17,574
the plates were too fuckin' heavy
for those old engines.

1170
01:36:17,708 --> 01:36:20,825
I was that paranoid that
I'd get into trouble about it,

1171
01:36:20,958 --> 01:36:24,576
I fuckin' sent Walker an e-mail
and I cc-ed it to Haynes,

1172
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:29,247
saying, "Not to be used under
any circumstances whatsoever."

1173
01:36:29,375 --> 01:36:31,115
It wasn't fuckin' safe.

1174
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:35,994
Please fuckin' tell me that Frankie
did not fuckin' die in that, Fergus.

1175
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:37,956
Don't fuckin' tell me that.

1176
01:36:39,667 --> 01:36:42,830
- Nelson took him out.
- Nah, fuckin' rubbish.

1177
01:36:42,958 --> 01:36:44,368
- I know.
- No, no.

1178
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,456
- Nelson wasn't even in the country.
- Nelson...

1179
01:36:46,583 --> 01:36:48,448
Nelson was on a job to Afghanistan.

1180
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:51,120
No, Nelson took him out.
I know he did.

1181
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:53,036
Fergus, no. He fuckin' didn't.

1182
01:36:53,167 --> 01:36:55,249
He was on a plane to Afghanistan.

1183
01:36:55,375 --> 01:36:58,242
I know, because
my mate was on the plane with him.

1184
01:36:58,375 --> 01:37:02,823
Nelson took him out!
I fuckin' know he did.

1185
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:06,405
Tipped off his driver - ex-cop.

1186
01:37:06,542 --> 01:37:08,874
Ex-fucking cop. Took him out.

1187
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,662
Frankie was leaving the Green Zone.

1188
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:14,158
Paid him ten grand to have him done.

1189
01:37:14,292 --> 01:37:16,908
- Fucking Nelson did it.
- What, fucking Mad Max?

1190
01:37:17,042 --> 01:37:19,749
- With a fuckin' limp?
- Yeah, Mad Max!

1191
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:21,536
Who fuckin' told you that?

1192
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:24,158
Fucking Haynes told me.
Haynes fuckin' told me.

1193
01:37:24,292 --> 01:37:28,456
Fuck off, man. Mad Max was fuckin' killed
coming out of the Green Zone.

1194
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:30,790
He got a fuckin' Baghdad haircut.

1195
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:35,947
Mad Max was fuckin' caught
coming out of the Green Zone,

1196
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:38,699
they fuckin' cut his throat,
it was on the fuckin' net.

1197
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:41,074
And that was a week
before Frankie fuckin' died.

1198
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:43,164
- No, no! Wait!
- I'm telling you...

1199
01:37:43,292 --> 01:37:45,499
Fucking Haynes told me!

1200
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:48,332
- He fucking told me!
- That's not it, man.

1201
01:37:48,458 --> 01:37:51,040
- Fucking Nelson!
- Oi! Sit down, stop shouting.

1202
01:37:51,167 --> 01:37:53,158
- Lads...
- Fergus, please, man.

1203
01:37:53,292 --> 01:37:56,125
- Fuckin' settle down.
- You don't fucking get it.

1204
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:59,742
I'm telling you now -
Mad Max had his fuckin' throat cut,

1205
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:02,912
a week before Frankie died.
It was posted on the internet,

1206
01:38:03,042 --> 01:38:05,829
him screaming for his fucking life.

1207
01:38:05,958 --> 01:38:08,870
- It wasn't fucking Nelson.
- Wait, wait!

1208
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,616
Put two and two together, Fergus.

1209
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:14,036
I don't know where you're
fucking getting this from.

1210
01:38:14,167 --> 01:38:15,998
That's not the fucking case.

1211
01:38:16,125 --> 01:38:21,950
Nelson fuckin' told me himself,
that he paid Max ten fucking grand,

1212
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:25,951
to have Frankie fucking slotted.
He told me himself!

1213
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:27,994
- Nelson told you...
- Yes!

1214
01:38:29,292 --> 01:38:31,328
Nelson was in fuckin' Afghanistan.

1215
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:32,826
Please. Sit down.

1216
01:38:32,921 --> 01:38:34,215
None of yous are makin' any sense.

1217
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,549
Fergus, man. Please, just sit down.

1218
01:38:39,417 --> 01:38:41,578
- Fuck.
- Lad, come on. Sit down.

1219
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:44,290
It was on the internet, right?

1220
01:38:47,208 --> 01:38:49,369
- Fergus, man!
- What are you doing?

1221
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:52,035
Fergus? Fergus!

1222
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:58,075
Fergus, for fuck's sake!
Where you going?

1223
01:38:58,208 --> 01:38:59,948
Fergus!

1224
01:39:00,083 --> 01:39:03,405
Fergus, man. Fuck's sake,
get out the fuckin' car.

1225
01:39:03,542 --> 01:39:05,328
- Fuck off.
- Fuckin' hell, Fergus!

1226
01:39:05,458 --> 01:39:07,494
Don't do anything stupid, Fergus.

1227
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:11,789
Fergus, get out the car!
Fergus! Fuck's sake!

1228
01:39:12,833 --> 01:39:14,414
Fucking hell.

1229
01:39:41,917 --> 01:39:44,408
Inhale, and then exhale.

1230
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:48,699
Lovely. Touch the ceiling.

1231
01:39:56,417 --> 01:39:58,954
And pull it back.

1232
01:39:59,083 --> 01:40:02,325
If you imagine that
you're against a wall,

1233
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:05,950
and if you're against the wall,
keeping flat...

1234
01:40:43,375 --> 01:40:45,787
Raise your glasses...

1235
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:51,206
..and the future.

1236
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:11,017
I'll look forward to it.

1237
01:41:11,106 --> 01:41:12,913
Thank you very much. That was great today.

1238
01:41:13,042 --> 01:41:15,408
Thank you. Bye-bye, have a safe journey.

1239
01:41:20,208 --> 01:41:22,870
All right, gents.
Good to meet you both, at last.

1240
01:41:24,625 --> 01:41:26,581
See you when I get back.

1241
01:41:27,292 --> 01:41:28,998
Look forward to it.

1242
01:41:32,125 --> 01:41:34,741
Hayley, would you like a lift?
We're going your way.

1243
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:36,661
That's very nice. Andrew?

1244
01:41:37,833 --> 01:41:40,449
I'd better not,
I've got lots of work to do. Thanks.

1245
01:41:50,292 --> 01:41:52,203
Andrew...

1246
01:41:56,125 --> 01:41:57,865
Open it.

1247
01:42:02,292 --> 01:42:05,250
- What is it, Alex?
- I'm not sure.

1248
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:14,533
"Wrong place, wrong time."

1249
01:42:56,375 --> 01:42:58,286
It's me, Fergus.

1250
01:42:59,708 --> 01:43:01,323
Listen, I...

1251
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:04,411
I saw you at the studio.

1252
01:43:05,542 --> 01:43:08,534
I really... wish...

1253
01:43:08,667 --> 01:43:10,953
I wanted to speak to you one more time,

1254
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:13,665
But I just... I couldn't.

1255
01:43:13,792 --> 01:43:17,990
Just couldn't... bear it.
Couldn't face it.

1256
01:43:19,917 --> 01:43:21,657
Look, it's, er...

1257
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:27,705
It's hard for a civvy
to understand this, but I just...

1258
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:32,079
just wanted a piece of me old self back.

1259
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:36,162
The way I was.

1260
01:43:36,292 --> 01:43:38,248
Wish you'd known me then.

1261
01:43:39,042 --> 01:43:42,534
There's things I need you to do.

1262
01:43:42,667 --> 01:43:45,374
I've spoken to a solicitor.

1263
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:48,663
He knows what I want,
but I need your help.

1264
01:43:48,792 --> 01:43:50,953
You've got to go and see Harim.

1265
01:43:52,083 --> 01:43:55,655
Make sure that the Iraqi mother
and her family are taken care of.

1266
01:43:56,625 --> 01:43:58,707
Frankie wanted that.

1267
01:44:01,375 --> 01:44:05,914
Criminal sons of bitches on the make,
that's what we've been.

1268
01:44:09,208 --> 01:44:13,406
Look, I never told you this...

1269
01:44:14,417 --> 01:44:15,907
but, er...

1270
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,240
I once saw this...

1271
01:44:20,583 --> 01:44:23,746
...this child pulled from the rubble
by her grandfather.

1272
01:44:25,875 --> 01:44:27,740
She wore a lilac top.

1273
01:44:30,417 --> 01:44:33,124
Her left leg dangled from a sinew.

1274
01:44:34,375 --> 01:44:36,240
Her feet, shredded.

1275
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:44,787
She points at me when I try to sleep.

1276
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:51,990
Heading off, now.

1277
01:44:53,333 --> 01:44:55,198
With Frankie.

1278
01:44:56,583 --> 01:44:58,539
Down by the river.

1279
01:45:00,792 --> 01:45:04,740
Best put a mad dog down
before it savages someone else.

1280
01:45:08,625 --> 01:45:10,536
Look after Craig for me.

1281
01:45:12,333 --> 01:45:14,244
I think he'll make it.

1282
01:45:15,625 --> 01:45:17,741
He just might need help with it.

1283
01:45:25,792 --> 01:45:27,874
Love you, Rachel.

1284
01:45:29,417 --> 01:45:31,499
I love you, Rachel.

1285
