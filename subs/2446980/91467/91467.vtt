"Possum Gully, Australia, 1897.

00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,285
"Dear Fellow Countrymen,

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,788

Get up there!

Sybylla!

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,451
Go on, then. Take that in the house
for Mother.

32
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,328
Go on!
Get in the house!

33
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,750
Sybylla!

34
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,881
Secure the windows!

35
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,635
Sybylla!

36
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,389
Get out here!

37
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,978
I'm coming!

38
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,552
Sybylla, I want to have
a talk with you.

39
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,096
Talk away.

40
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,819
You're a young woman now,

41
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,571
and-

42
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,827
I have been thinking about this
a great deal.

43
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,830
We can't afford to keep you
any longer.

44
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,712
Do you think you could
earn your own living?

45
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,297
Of course.

46
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,591
And how would you do that?

47
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,387
I'd like to be a pianist.

48
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:32,224
Oh, Sybylla.
That takes years of practice.

49
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,811
You know we can't afford it. You've thought
of something already, haven't you?

50
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,815
I've arranged a position for you.

51
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,026
A position?

52
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,944
As a general servant.

53
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,531
Servant?

54
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,993
I won't.
We have no choice.

55
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,413
You just want to get rid of me.
I must do what I feel is right!

56
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,624
Oh, I prayed to God
for guidance.

57
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,959
And this is what
he told you to do?

58
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,003
God be damned!

59
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:08,344
It's a wonder God didn't
strike her dead at my feet.

60
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,764
Same as all your damned family.

61
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,974
Delusions of grandeur.

62
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:23,275
To have such a daughter-
useless, plain and godless.

63
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,361
What can I do?

64
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,452
I want to do great things, Gertie,

65
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,871
not be a servant.

66
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,416
I hate this life.

67
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,378
Should never have left
the mountains.

68
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,964
It's not Father's fault.

69
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,386
You can't blame him for the drought.

70
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:56,642
Gertie, don't you ever dream
there's more to life than this?

71
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:01,063
Don't you want to meet people
who talk about books and words...

72
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,899
and have visions?

73
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,780
Gertie, I can't settle
for a new dress,

74
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,782
a picnic now and then.

75
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:17,163
Living out in the bush for the rest of my life,
I might just as well be dead.

76
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,165
Don't say things like that.

77
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,168
Well, why doesn't Mother
understand?

78
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,836
Why doesn't anyone?

79
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,048
I think you're the nicest, cleverest girl
in the whole entire world.

80
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,176
I'm not.

81
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,178
I'm mad.

82
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,264
It'd be better if I didn't think at all.

83
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:42,813
It's no use for me.
I've no training, no money.

84
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,900
I haven't any time
to study or practice.

85
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,987
Just two states of existence-

86
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,072
work and sleep.

87
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,244
Sybylla!

88
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,459
Sybylla, why do you never answer
when I call?

89
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,547
I want you to fetch your father.

90
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,062
It's all right.
I'll do it.

91
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,169
Looking for your dad, are ya?

92
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,382
Just missed him.
Left with the schoolmaster.

93
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,759
Blind leading the blind!

94
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,469
As usual!

95
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,024
Come on.

96
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,279
Hup! Hup! Come on.

97
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,435
I've had a letter
from your grandmother.

98
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,520
You'd better read it!

99
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:59,158
Says she's sorry to hear you're such a source
of grief and annoyance...

100
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:03,162
and thinks you might be in danger
of forming ties beneath you here.

101
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:08,792
Oh, Syb, you're to go
to Gran at Caddagat!

102
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,759
Gertie!

103
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,361
Good day!
Good day, Jack! How are ya?

104
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,172
Go on.
Good day, Bill!

105
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,050
Good day, Jack.
Had a good trip?

106
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,136
Fine, Bill, just fine.
Not a bad run at all.

107
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,110
I say, driver.
Yes, sir?

108
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:20,072
I believe Mrs. Bossier's granddaughter
was supposed to have been on the coach.
Oh! That's me!

109
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,742
Thank you, Jack.

110
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,707
- Hello.
- Miss Melvyn?

111
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,627
Yes. Where's Uncle J.J.?

112
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,504
Um, he's away.

113
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,673
On business.

114
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm Frank Hawden.

115
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,011
- What are you?
- Ajackaroo.

116
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,515
That's poetry.

117
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,810
Yes.
Thank you.

118
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,520
See you next week, then.
Bye.

119
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,355
Bye-bye, Jack!
Bye, missy.

120
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,277
Go on.

121
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,363
Bye!

122
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,086
You're a new chum, aren't you?
Certainly not.

123
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,131
I've been in the colony
well over three months.
Oh.

124
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,425
Still wet behind the ears.

125
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,599
I was surprised back there...

126
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,684
at your being
Mrs. Bossier's granddaughter.

127
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,561
Really?
Yes.

128
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,565
I mean, you're not at all like them,
Mrs. Bossier or your aunt, Mrs. Bell.

129
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,567
They're so awfully
good-looking.

130
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,736
Indeed!
Yes.

131
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,865
But never mind.
You seem like a good sort.
We'll have some fun.

132
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,327
Well, I'm glad
I meet with your approval,
Mr. Hawden,

133
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,912
in even a small degree.

134
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,920
Caddagat!

135
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,598
Hello! We're here!

136
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,738
Sybylla!
Welcome, my dear!

137
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,699
Welcome!
Oh, Grandma.

138
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,411
Sybylla.

139
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,470
Oh!

140
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,432
I remember this!

141
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,101
Oh!

142
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,822
For the gracious bounties
we are about to receive...

143
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,866
may the good Lord
make us truly thankful.

144
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,827
Amen.
Amen.

145
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,007
Hmm.

146
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,688
Take some more, dear.

147
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:53,660
Will this be sufficient for you, Frank?
Yes, thank you.

148
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,585
Thank you, Mrs. Bossier.

149
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,671
Ah.

150
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:25,275
Helen, have you seen any patterns
in the catalog you like?

151
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,321
Well, there were two, yes.
Yes, I bought two lovely ones for Sybylla.

152
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,239
That's a good idea.

153
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,408
What color, do you think?

154
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,411
Oh, sky blue.
Or pretty pink?

155
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,664
And what would you like,
Sybylla?

156
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,290
Lemon.

157
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:18,328
Thank you, dear.

158
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,919
But, Helen,
you look so beautiful.

159
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,339
Don't you recognize
your own mother?

160
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,175
This was her room
when she was young.

161
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,181
We'll see you in the morning.

162
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,684
Sleep well.
Good night.

163
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,469
Ohh.

164
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,388
Now...

165
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,474
what's all this about?

166
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,311
Mother-

167
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,188
Mother.

168
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,652
And I'm so ugly.

169
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,404
Nobody loves me.

170
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,573
Oh, Sybylla.

171
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,036
Stop all this
and into bed with you.

172
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,746
Come along.

173
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,808
I don't understand you,
Sybylla.

174
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:50,939
There's- There's any amount of love
and good in the world, you know.

175
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:57,404
But it doesn't just come to you.
You have to search for it.

176
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,366
Being misunderstood...

177
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,869
is a trial we must all bear.

178
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:12,252
You have a- a wildness of spirit
which is going to get you
into trouble all your life.

179
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,379
Mm-hmm.

180
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,840
So you must learn
to control it.

181
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,843
And try and cultivate
a little more feminine vanity.

182
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,344
Oh, I've given up.

183
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:25,098
Plain looks never stopped
anyone from being...

184
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,435
intelligent or witty or-
or making friends.

185
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,230
Being beautiful is...

186
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,733
no guarantee of success
in anything.

187
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,986
But it does help a little.

188
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,367
I have a plan.
You'll never make me more than middling ugly.

189
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,913
We'll see. But first of all,
no more looking in mirrors.

190
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,591
And no more thinking
about yourself.

191
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,301
Hmm?

192
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,849
Oh!

193
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,192
Seventy-eight, seventy-nine,

194
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,611
eighty,

195
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:23,698
eighty-one, eighty-two,

196
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,285
eighty-three, eighty-four,

197
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:32,248
eighty-five, eighty-six,
eighty-seven-

198
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:46,763
"I had a dove,
and the sweet dove died,

199
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,766
"and I could have thought
it died of grieving.

200
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,851
Oh, who could it grieve for?"

201
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,374
Oh!

202
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,334
Mr. Hawden!

203
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,877
Frank.

204
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,548
How terribly kind.

205
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,591
Not at all!

206
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,577
Rain! Ohh!

207
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:21,441
Now you see the consequences
ofwild and extravagant behavior.

208
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:25,195
You'd have done the same ifyou hadn't
seen decent rain for over a year.

209
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,240
Well, a few days in bed
will keep you out of mischief.

210
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:32,410
Harry has brought you some apples
all the way from Five Bob Downs.

211
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,162
You remember
Harry, dear?

212
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,081
Oh, Podgy?

213
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:40,502
Sybylla! Harry and Miss Augusta
are the most important people in the district!

214
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:45,507
Too good for me then.
I'm only good for the local boy who has pimples and stinks.

215
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:51,262
I shall make quite sure
my granddaughter will never marry a man unworthy of her.

216
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,264
Don't worry.
I don't.

217
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,351
I'm not marrying anyone.
I'm going to have a career.

218
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,855
A career. What in?

219
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,984
Mmm, literature, music, art.

220
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,861
Maybe the opera.

221
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,947
I've not made up my mind yet.

222
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:22,460
I fear, Helen, we underestimated
her mother's problem.

223
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:25,004
I wish Julius were here.

224
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,257
She needs a man's hand.

225
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,969
Ethel.
Yes, ma'am?

226
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,222
Take this to the kitchen, please.

227
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:59,164
# Maggie Piggins on the wall
Maggie Piggins going to fall #

228
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,790
# Maggie Piggins very tall #

229
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,959
# Maggie Piggins dancin' #

230
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:07,589
# Maggie Piggins had the coo
Brown and white within the brew #

231
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,841
# Open the gate
and let him through #

232
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,926
# Maggie Piggins in tr- #

233
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,518
Do you, um, need a hand?

234
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,270
No, thank you.

235
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,858
You're, uh, new here, aren't you?

236
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,652
Do you work in the kitchen?

237
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:33,198
I'd be obliged to you, sir,
ifyou'd take yourself out of the way,

238
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:36,075
unless you want me foot
in your big, fat face.

239
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:48,463
How about, um, a reward?

240
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,215
Let me go.

241
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,265
You should be ashamed.

242
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,684
A gentleman like yourself...

243
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,270
peepin' and pryin'
on innocent girls.

244
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,774
You'll have me sacked,
you will.

245
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,117
What's your name?

246
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,246
Wouldn't you like to know!

247
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,546
Ah.

248
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,721
Hmm.

249
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,270
Ah, it's a picture, you are!

250
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,897
Can't I look now?

251
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:49,691
What do you think,
Biddy?

252
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,443
Well, ma'am, I don't think
the glass'll break.

253
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,114
Biddy!

254
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,582
I hope you can say something
to your Uncle Julius.

255
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,543
Uncle J.J.?
He's not here!

256
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,586
Mm-hmm.
Oh!

257
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,297
Thank you, Aunt Helen.

258
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,923
It's beautiful.

259
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,052
Oh, Sybylla!

260
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,054
There she is!

261
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,056
Uncle J.J.!

262
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,060
Here.

263
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,564
By George,
you're a good-looking young lady!

264
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,609
Ah. You've changed,
no doubt about that.

265
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:37,864
You haven't. Your kisses
still smell ofwhiskey and cigars.

266
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,325
That's what makes 'em irresistible.

267
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,580
Ah, come in, gentlemen!

268
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,206
Hello, Harry.

269
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,001
Hello, Mrs. Bossier.
I'm delighted you could join us this evening.

270
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,675
Well, for goodness' sake, Frank, get him a drink!

271
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:05,183
Sybylla, this is our dear friend,
Harry Beecham.

272
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,435
Harry, you remember
my granddaughter.

273
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,355
Uh, y-yes, Miss Melvyn.

274
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,023
I...

275
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,025
never would have
recognized you.

276
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,319
No, nor I, Mr. Beecham.

277
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,909
I believe I have to thank you for the apples
you sent to me when I was ill.

278
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,830
And Frank's very good at giving me flowers.
Aren't you, Frank?

279
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,960
Y- Yes.

280
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,552
Well, the drought up country's
not broken yet, Harry.

281
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,555
Saw a lot of unfortunate fellows
on the road heading south.

282
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,558
Yes, we've noticed more
calling in here for food recently.

283
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,477
Very bad. Very bad.

284
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:54,148
Yes, I was approached
by one of them today.

285
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,192
A very ill-mannered sort.

286
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,070
While I was picking blossom.

287
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,823
Goodness, dear!
He was very forward.

288
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,409
He wanted to kiss me.

289
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,412
You should have called me.
I'd have taken care of him.

290
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,748
I'm sure you would.
But I can look after myself, Frank.

291
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,375
Good girl!

292
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,544
That's the sort we want.
Eh, Harry?

293
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,422
Absolutely.

294
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,090
Thank you, Ethel.

295
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:23,052
I fear Mrs. Hickey's decided that now is
an appropriate time to have her baby.

296
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:25,388
I promised to help.
Excuse me.

297
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,558
Mother, can't I go?
No, no, dear. No.

298
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,935
Enjoy yourselves.
Good night.

299
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,271
Good night, Mother.
Good night.

300
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,319
Sybylla.
Thank you.

301
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,203
Are you finished?

302
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,290
Would you like some more, Helen?
Yes. Thanks, Julius.

303
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,668
There you are, Harry.
Help yourself.

304
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:31,037
# Ta-rah-rah-boom-di-ay
Ta-rah-rah-boom-di-ay #

305
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,832
# Ta-rah-rah-boom-di-ay
Ta-rah-rah-boom-di-ay #

306
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,047
Ah, your turn for a song,
Harry.

307
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,715
Ah, um,

308
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,884
I don't know any.

309
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,802
Oh, I can give you
a song.

310
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,434
# There were
three drunken maidens #

311
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,061
# Down the Isle ofWight #

312
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,646
# They drunk from Sunday morning #

313
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,564
# Nor stopped for Saturday night #

314
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,399
# Then Saturday night
did come around #

315
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,318
# The girls
they wouldn't go home #

316
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,863
# And those three drunken maidens
pushed the jug about #

317
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:09,534
- Where on earth did you learn that?
- In the pub, of course.

318
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,786
# Then where are
all your feathered hats #

319
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,996
# Your clothes so rich and fine #

320
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:17,375
# They've all been swallowed up, boys
in tankards of good wine #

321
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,252
# And where are
all your maidenheads #

322
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,504
# Your maidens rich and fine #
Our Sybylla appears to have
hidden talents.

323
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,549
The only trouble is,
you don't know what she'll do next.

324
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,676
I seem to recall
she was always like this.

325
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,722
Ohh!

326
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,724
Sorry, Frank.
I loved it.

327
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:49,448
From what I hear, Julius, last night
was little short of a bacchanalian debauch.

328
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,868
What?
Oh, who told you that, Mother?
Ask Helen.

329
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,371
She has one of her sick headaches.

330
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,623
Ah.

331
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,376
Sybylla.
Good morning, Grandma.

332
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,461
Good morning, Uncle J.J.
Morning.

333
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,131
- Harry?
- He left early.

334
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:13,055
I gather your behavior
last night, young lady, left a lot to be desired.

335
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,851
I'd have said Harry enjoyed himself.
That's not what I heard.

336
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,686
Excuse me.

337
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,983
Anyway, Syb solved
one problem last night.

338
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,110
Indeed.
Her future.

339
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,571
She should be
an actress.

340
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,033
Are you suggesting my granddaughter
should be an actress?

341
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,036
She has a talent for it.
I could introduce her-

342
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,579
Go on the stage?

343
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:41,917
I'd rather see her with her hair shorn off
and shut up in a convent.

344
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,045
Don't ever mention
the subject again.

345
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,663
I enjoyed meself last night.

346
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,749
I thought we got on
jolly well together. Didn't you?

347
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,670
Miss Melvyn- Ahh!

348
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,505
Sybylla.

349
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,256
I've been thinking.

350
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,258
While looks aren't everything,
and, um-

351
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,928
Would you come
to the point, Frank?

352
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,931
Well, now that this-
this fellow Harry has gone,

353
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,933
you should pay some heed
to my attentions.

354
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,061
Do you mean your attentions
or your intentions?

355
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,231
At the conclusion of the coming year
I will be returning to England,

356
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:48,234
and I expect you
to return with me as my wife.

357
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,779
Well, what do you say?
Oh, let me go.

358
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,407
Not until I have your answer.

359
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:14,719
Well, there is this in your favor-
You don't say you're sorry when you are not.

360
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,888
Why should I pretend
about a person like Frank Hawden?

361
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,974
But you are not prepared
to apologize?

362
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,434
What for?

363
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,562
Your aunt and I thought
that you liked him.
Liked him?

364
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,940
He appears to be
extremely fond ofyou.

365
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,942
Now listen to me, Sybylla.

366
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:33,028
In a few years he'll come into
quite a large fortune in England.

367
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:36,741
He comes of a very good family
and will make someone an excellent husband.

368
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,492
Well, it won't be me!

369
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,412
Oh, do be realistic, child.
Well, I am!

370
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,706
To begin with,
I don't love him.

371
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:47,251
That is not the point.
Well, it is to me.

372
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,546
Sybylla, do you want to be
a burden on your family forever...

373
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,466
with no status in decent society
or a home ofyour own?

374
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,053
I will not be married off
to someone I detest, by you or anybody!

375
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,807
At times I fear for you, my girl.

376
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:06,896
You are rude to your elders and betters
and often lack all gentility.

377
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:11,859
Very well.

378
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,072
Though you may not be prepared
to apologize to Frank,

379
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,241
I expect you to apologize to me...

380
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,537
when you have regained
your... humor...

381
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,289
and your manners.

382
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,094
You must learn not to shout
at your grandmother, Sybylla.

383
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,263
I didn't mean to.

384
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,934
It just surges up in me
when she starts on about marriage.

385
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,936
She just doesn't seem
to understand.

386
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,146
Sit down here next to me.

387
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,606
Come on.

388
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,405
Now, believe me, Sybylla,
the best kind of marriage...

389
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,951
is not love marriage
but friendship marriage.

390
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,869
Friendship?
Yes.

391
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,707
You see,

392
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,918
your mother married for love.

393
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,423
And...

394
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,175
I too...

395
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,053
married for love.

396
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,393
My husband isn't dead.

397
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:32,439
He- He left me
for someone else.

398
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:37,695
Left me to live
the rest of my life with the-

399
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:42,199
the shame of being
neither wife nor widow...

400
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,868
nor maid.

401
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,788
But why should you
be ashamed?

402
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,751
Marriage gives us
respectability, dear, as you'll learn.

403
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:56,046
No, that is just
what men want us to believe.

404
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,550
Stupid idiots like-
like Frank Hawden.

405
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,636
Well, I won't be caught up in it,
not by him or anyone.

406
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,897
Aunt Helen, please.

407
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,983
Please stop trying
to marry me off.

408
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,488
Well, I suppose I should...

409
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,828
tear up this invitation, then,
from Miss Augusta...

410
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,998
for you to stay a few days
at Five Bob.

411
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,583
Hmm?

412
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,920
Shall I?

413
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,839
No!

414
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,684
I hear you've made a lot of changes
at Five Bob, Mr. Beecham.

415
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,689
Oh, yes, we have.

416
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,778
Must have been hard for you
when your father died.

417
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:05,741
Can I drive?

418
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,909
Whoa, boy, whoa.

419
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,753
Dear Lucy's daughter.

420
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,463
There's little resemblance.

421
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,591
No. I'm sorry.

422
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,261
A pity.

423
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,222
Well, come in.

424
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,894
Come along, child.
I'm not going to eat you.

425
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,405
Well, I think I'll turn in.

426
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,326
Early start tomorrow.
Good night, Aunt Gussie.

427
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,744
Good night, dear.

428
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,663
Good night, Miss Melvyn.
Good night, Mr. Beecham.

429
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,719
He always seems so quiet
and composed.

430
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,013
You don't have to live with him.

431
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:40,979
This must be the most
beautiful house in the world.

432
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,691
Too big.
Too many corners to dust.

433
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,903
Fancy living in it, do you?

434
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,448
No. I'd get lost.

435
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,409
I wouldn't know what to do
with all those servants.

436
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,496
I wouldn't even know
what groceries to order.

437
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,419
I think another glass of port
won't harm us.

438
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,392
Beautiful creatures.

439
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,645
They're fortunate, aren't they?

440
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,439
Every day they get their food.

441
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,525
As long as I remember.

442
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:34,700
They never have to look for water
in a dried-up creek,

443
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,372
scratch for a living...

444
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,043
like all our countrymen.

445
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,045
Forced on the road to beg.

446
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,632
Perhaps they are meant to
counterbalance the ugly things of life.

447
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,318
Do you read the Australian poets,
Miss Gussie?

448
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:34,009
You know, I think ugly girls should be
strangled at birth by their parents.

449
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:38,013
It's bad enough being born a girl,
but being born ugly and clever-

450
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,766
Oh. Clever, are you?

451
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,559
Well, I hope so.

452
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:44,561
I'm done for if I'm not.

453
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,980
Has to be something
I'm good at.

454
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,275
There's sure to be.

455
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,079
Cool breezes ripples
at the river below...

456
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:05,457
as fleecy clouds float high...

457
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:09,419
and I mark how
the dark green gum trees match...

458
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,881
the bright blue vault of the sky.

459
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:17,719
We wouldn't be out of place
on the Thames in England.

460
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,222
I haven't done this for years.

461
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,622
Oh!
Sybylla!

462
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,836
Race you home!

463
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,728
You didn't stay long
at the river.

464
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:54,149
You washed your hair.
That will never dry by dinner.

465
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,235
Perhaps I should cut it all off.
Well, no, dear.

466
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,864
It'd be a pity to lose
your finest asset.

467
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,033
My only asset,
more like.

468
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,786
Oh, I wouldn't go
quite as far as that.

469
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,415
Hmm.

470
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,376
It must be contagious.

471
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:15,128
What's that?
Washing one's hair.

472
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,383
Or did you, by chance,
have an accident at the river?

473
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,469
No, no. I don't wish
to hear the details.

474
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:28,850
Well, as you both seem able
to entertain yourselves,

475
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,685
I'll see to dinner.

476
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:46,326
I was worried when I couldn't see you
when I came to the surface.

477
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,704
I thought
you might have drowned.

478
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:52,833
What a terrible loss to the world.

479
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,002
Yes, it would have been.

480
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,018
Good night, Miss Melvyn.

481
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,769
Good night, Mr. Beecham.

482
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:56,891
Yaah!

483
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,347
Ohh!

484
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,282
Thank you.

485
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,452
Coffee?

486
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,751
Well?

487
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:49,170
She was
a precocious child.

488
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:52,632
There's an improvement,
but not much.

489
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,094
Still skinny.

490
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:03,143
She's very young, Harry,
and spirited.

491
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,021
Take care.

492
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,149
Don't rush anything.

493
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,028
Very good.

494
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:17,574
Peddle a little faster.
Yes, a little faster.

495
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,285
Very good.

496
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,251
How long will you be away?

497
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:31,171
Oh, quite a few weeks.

498
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:33,506
I've got to go to the Queensland property first...
Oh, God.

499
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,092
and then to the shearing
at the Riverina.

500
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,178
Wait a minute.

501
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:53,526
I'll come over and see you
as soon as I get back.

502
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:57,989
There.

503
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,205
There we are.

504
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:08,917
Well, safe home.
Thank you, Gussie.

505
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:10,877
Bye-bye, J.J.
Bye, Harry.

506
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,337
Good-bye, J.J.
Good-bye, my dear.

507
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:16,132
You be careful with that bicycle, do you hear?
I will. Bye-bye!

508
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,260
Bye-bye.

509
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:45,537
# Last night as I lay sleeping #

510
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:49,332
# There came a dream so fair #

511
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:53,002
# I stood in old Jerusalem #

512
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:57,048
# Beside the temple there #

513
00:52:57,132 --> 00:53:00,510
# I heard the children singing #

514
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:04,013
# And ever as they sang #

515
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,684
# Me thought the voice of angels #

516
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:11,229
# From heaven in answer rang #

517
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:17,694
# Me thought the voice of angels #

518
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:24,325
# From heaven in answer rang #

519
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:32,166
#Jerusalem #

520
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:37,630
# Lift up your voice and sing #

521
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,925
# Hosanna #

522
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:44,095
# In the highest #

523
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:50,643
# Hosanna to your king #

524
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:58,026
It must have been pretty quiet
for you at Five Bob.

525
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,029
Oh, I survived.

526
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,155
Mmm. Such a heavenly scent.

527
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,158
Really, Sybylla, must you play
those vulgar songs?

528
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,286
There are so many nice ones,
aren't there?

529
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,125
Here you are.

530
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:59,087
That should keep you going
for a while.

531
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,172
Thank you.
Good-bye. Good luck.

532
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,257
You too.

533
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:07,178
We'll have to watch her, Helen.
She'll give away half of Caddagat to those fellows.

534
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:14,268
Can't something be done for them?
You see?

535
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:18,314
She'd carve up the place
among them and send me on the wallaby.

536
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:23,111
Frank. And make sure Butler
gives you the right gauge ofwire this time. Hmm?

537
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,154
Of course, Mr. Bossier.
Hmm.

538
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,824
There's our acceptance
for the ball, and make sure you give it to Harry.

539
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,159
Harry. Harry Beecham?
He's back?

540
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,870
Oh, yes. Has been
for a couple ofweeks.

541
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:35,289
That's all
the mail, unless you have
anything to add.

542
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,333
Um, can I take it?

543
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:40,837
Well, I don't suppose Frank
would mind a passenger.

544
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:45,091
- Oh, I'd like to go by myself.
- Not on your life, Syb. Not with those horses.

545
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,859
Strange that Harry's not been over.

546
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:07,739
Can't have much time for you.

547
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,454
Excuse me.
Don't go through the gate.

548
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,622
Hmm. Oh. Whoa!

549
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:20,209
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

550
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,962
You'll soon realize
you can't do better than me.

551
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,799
I'd love to see the looks at home.

552
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:30,678
You'd certainly surprise
those English girls, you know.

553
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:32,680
Yes, sir.

554
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:34,682
Oh, damn.

555
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:43,733
Hey. Hey, wait.

556
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,736
Wait! Damn it!

557
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,238
Wait, damn you! Stop!

558
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,138
How have you been?

559
00:57:14,223 --> 00:57:16,140
I'm well.

560
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:18,309
As I was two weeks ago.

561
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,687
Pleased to hear that.

562
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:25,274
You promised to come to Caddagat
as soon as you got back.

563
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,443
I've been busy.

564
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:29,737
You promised.

565
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:33,366
We haven't got that muslin Mrs. Bossier wanted.
It'll be here next week.

566
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,451
Thanks, Mrs. Butler.
I'll tell her.

567
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:37,620
You're just the same
as all men.

568
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,456
And you're different
from other girls?

569
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:43,376
I've heard how you've been behaving,
flirting with every man within miles.

570
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,461
Who told you that?

571
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:47,547
Who?

572
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:51,676
Frank Hawden?

573
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:54,637
There. That's everything, Miss Melvyn.
And you believed him.

574
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,390
See you next time.
Thank you, Mrs. Butler.

575
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,526
I'm sorry.

576
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,779
So you should be.

577
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:00,995
I- I thought we were mates.
Aren't we?

578
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,548
I'll see you at the ball.
Ahh!

579
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:26,103
And do you mean to say
that Frank had to walk four miles back here?

580
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:30,066
In his tight boots?

581
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,109
It's no joking matter, Julius.

582
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:34,862
No, no, Mother. No, no, no.

583
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,369
Serves him right though.

584
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:44,288
That girl must learn
to behave.

585
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:46,749
I've sent her to her room.

586
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:07,478
Did, uh-

587
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,356
Did you see Harry at Dogtrap?

588
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,358
Yes.

589
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:16,320
Oh.

590
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:18,531
You know, I-

591
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,784
I think you might be in love
with Harry Beecham.

592
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:26,163
We're friends, that's all.
Nothing else.

593
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:31,460
Be careful how you treat him.

594
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,546
What do you mean?

595
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:37,925
Well, you know what they say:
Heed the spark or you may dread the fire.

596
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:41,679
- For heaven's sake.
- Well, Sybylla, he is a man ofthe world.

597
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:45,266
He has quite a reputation
with the ladies in Melbourne.

598
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,393
Yes, I'll bet he has.

599
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:50,271
And it's always
been taken for granted...

600
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:53,107
that he'd marry
into one ofthe best families.

601
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,276
Well, Aunt Gussie
will make sure of that.

602
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,322
Look, Aunt Helen,
you don't have to worry.

603
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:01,615
I know he can marry anyone.

604
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,701
I know.

605
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,495
And I know he wouldn't
want to marry me.

606
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:09,915
Even if I wanted to get married,
which I don't,

607
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,543
he'd never ask me in a million years.

608
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,476
So- So long as you know.

609
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,566
In the box,
there's a surprise for you-

610
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,110
a lovely new dress for the ball.

611
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:37,503
Excuse me, ma'am.
Dinner is served.

612
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,801
Would you come in
to dinner, everyone?

613
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,182
Ah, Gussie. Allow me, huh?
Thank you.

614
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:59,775
What a charming evening
it's turned out to be.

615
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:26,510
At that time it was in a terrible state.
Really shocking. Anyway, I remember-

616
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:34,685
There were people.
They were soldiers.
They actually- Thank you.

617
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,770
Oh, you're welcome.

618
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:40,024
All right.

619
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:44,862
I see that Furlow has
bought himself a very fine bull.

620
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,406
That should make
a few cows happy.

621
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:55,808
Rutherford.
The Duke of Rutherford, of course.

622
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,851
Really?
Almost family.

623
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:06,569
Go in, girls, and dance
with the grown-ups.

624
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:09,363
That was delightful.

625
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:12,366
Thank you.

626
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,577
I'm afraid she's
a bit of a handful.

627
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:17,955
I do hope she behaved herself
while she was with you.

628
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:21,584
Why not? Charming girl.

629
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,640
How you doin', miss?
You havin' a good time?
Will you dance?

630
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:20,851
Sure enough.

631
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,317
They're so stuffy
in there, Joe.

632
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,444
They've forgotten
how to enjoy themselves.

633
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:34,281
# I looked upon the nobles
with their lineages old #

634
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:38,786
- It's so much better to be here.
- # I looked upon their mansions
and their acres and their gold #

635
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:43,248
# I saw their women radiant
in jewelled robes appear #

636
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:47,378
# And then I joined the army
of the outcasts in the rear #

637
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:50,547
# Tramp, tramp #

638
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,502
Harry, let me go.

639
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,389
Didn't you like me
dancing with the peasants?

640
01:08:22,474 --> 01:08:24,475
I'm not going to make
a big thing ofthis.

641
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:27,561
I disgraced you, didn't I?
I have to go away for a few days.

642
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,605
Oh, more shearing somewhere else?

643
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,232
And I must be told-
is it yes or no?

644
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:34,902
- What's the question?
- Bloody woman.

645
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,904
I thought-

646
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:39,990
I thought
we should get married.

647
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:44,244
Well, what a handsome proposal.

648
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,830
How could anyone say no?

649
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:49,541
How dare you.

650
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:40,968
Harry, I- I'm sorry.

651
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:43,762
It was my fault.
It was stupid of me.

652
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:59,069
I should really get back to my guests.

653
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:33,854
Oh!

654
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:39,067
The boy's an idiot,
but you did lead him on.

655
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,153
I didn't mean to.

656
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:46,366
I'm a misfit, a larrikin.

657
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:50,245
My nose is the wrong shape.
True.

658
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,539
Then why me?

659
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:56,209
Because he loves you,
and I think you love him.

660
01:10:57,337 --> 01:10:59,421
And you make all the other misses
who've been through here...

661
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,382
look like so many pale insipid nobodies,
which they undoubtedly are.

662
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:06,303
But why does it always have
to come down to marriage?

663
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,847
Don't be foolish, child.

664
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:11,892
It's natural to want someone
as part ofyou, part ofyour life.

665
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,312
I don't want
to be part of anyone.

666
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:19,650
Do you imagine you're the only female on Earth
to have such notions?

667
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:25,906
Loneliness is a terrible price
to pay for independence.

668
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:30,911
Sybylla, don't throw away reality
for some impossible dream.

669
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:33,580
It's not impossible.

670
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:36,458
It's not.

671
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:58,563
Good-bye!

672
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,211
Hello, Podgy.

673
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,925
Hello, silly Syb.

674
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:30,322
I've got to leave all this, Syb.

675
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,449
We're closing the house.

676
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:36,203
I'm going north
to see to the other properties.

677
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:39,456
Why? What's happened?

678
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:43,418
The bank wants its money,
and I haven't got it.

679
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:45,754
They couldn't take everything.

680
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,839
They could.

681
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,761
How long have you known?

682
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,846
Quite a while.

683
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,309
Why didn't you tell me?

684
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,063
I'm sorry. I should've.

685
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:09,111
I was afraid of losing you as well.

686
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,948
Oh, Harry.

687
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:15,033
I am sorry.

688
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:27,462
Now you know.

689
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:30,590
There's no need to feel tied.

690
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:34,761
I mean, I shouldn't have asked you.
I- I had no right.

691
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:37,055
I'll be a poor man.

692
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:44,896
But we'll be friends...
and mates.

693
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,649
Won't we?

694
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,985
Of course.

695
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:53,446
Do you think I cared for you
just because you were rich?

696
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:55,824
No, Harry.

697
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:04,332
There's something I must say.

698
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:09,212
Um,

699
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:12,382
I- I wish I could help you.

700
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:17,888
Could you-

701
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:20,307
Can you give me a bit oftime?

702
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:22,392
Maybe two years.

703
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:26,980
You see, I'm just not ready yet.

704
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,941
Last night-

705
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:33,987
I don't know.
I think I was trying to hurt you,

706
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:37,991
make you let go, do something.

707
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:45,040
Give me a chance to find out
what's wrong with the world and with me,

708
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:48,376
who I am, everything.

709
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,047
Then I'll marry you,

710
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:55,300
if you need me and I can help.

711
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:00,222
You do understand, don't you?

712
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:06,436
Of course I do.

713
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,648
I knew you would.

714
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:13,628
I don't know what you've been up to now,
but Mrs. Bossier wants to see you.

715
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,922
Oh, Biddy, I've just got to finish this page-
She wants you now.

716
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:18,800
They're all waiting-
Mr. Julius and Mrs. Bell. Hurry.

717
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:22,470
Damn, damn, damn.

718
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,562
Come in, dear,
and sit down.

719
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,986
I'll come straight
to the point, Sybylla.

720
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:42,157
It seems your father has got himself
into difficulties again. Money, of course.

721
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:45,201
He borrowed L500
from a chap called McSwat...

722
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:49,497
and put the farm up as security
at four percent interest.

723
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,958
That's L20 a year. Very fair.

724
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:57,756
- What's this got to do with me?
- Well, your mother says she's tried,
but there is no way they can pay it.

725
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,385
And this McSwat chap's
made a very generous offer.
He'd be worth a few bob, I'd say.

726
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,512
Julius.

727
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:07,599
So it's been arranged
that instead of the interest,

728
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:11,644
he will accept your services
as governess to his children.

729
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:15,565
Arranged? Don't I have a say?

730
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,447
I won't go.

731
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:24,532
I won't.

732
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:33,500
Huh.

733
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:39,464
Life around here will certainly
be uneventful when she's gone.

734
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:43,176
Do her the world of good.

735
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,388
Make her think of other people...

736
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:48,473
instead of herself.

737
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,720
Uh, this is my name- Miss Melvyn.

738
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:31,307
Old boozy Melvyn's daughter.

739
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:33,935
I'll have no more impertinence,
thank you.

740
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:36,146
Now, sit up straight and attend.

741
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:39,983
James, fetch the textbooks, please.

742
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:42,360
Ain't got none.
Rats got 'em.

743
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,737
Pa says you can teach
out ofyour head.

744
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:48,366
Miss Killen couldn't.
She was as mad as a tree full of galahs.

745
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:51,411
And the one before her
only stayed a week...

746
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:53,455
and ran off in the bush,
and we never saw her again.

747
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,540
And the one before her.
Possum!

748
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,542
Possum!
Get down!

749
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:01,171
Possum!

750
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:04,591
Come back!

751
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,759
Come back!

752
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:19,230
Lizer, Sarah, come on.

753
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:23,067
Here you go.
Good girl.

754
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:29,866
Come on.
Tea's ready!

755
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:42,003
Watch it!

756
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:45,632
Save some for me, Jimmy.
Give me a bowl.

757
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:47,675
Here you go.

758
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,136
I don't want any.

759
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:52,889
Mom!

760
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:24,045
Jimmy, I've told you before.

761
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,422
Would you use a fork
to put the food into your mouth.

762
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:29,008
- Didn't give me one.
- Well, use your fingers.

763
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:31,386
Don't use your knife.
Why not? Pa does.

764
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:36,266
- I'm a richer man today than them that don't.
- You're right there, Pa.

765
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:38,601
Yeah, you're right, Pa.

766
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:42,272
- Well, your pa doesn't talk with his mouth full.
- Ma does.

767
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:46,067
You're gonna have your work
cut out with this lot.

768
01:21:57,288 --> 01:22:01,749
Oh. I see you've received
another one ofthese too.

769
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:05,587
Really, how can she expect us
to believe all this nonsense?

770
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:07,755
I won! I won!

771
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,217
Of course you won.
I didn't stand a chance.

772
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:13,386
Oh, yes, you did.
I did not.

773
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:16,264
You did.
I did not.

774
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,266
Ah.

775
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:22,270
Ah, Gertie, Frank.
Just in time for tea.

776
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,772
Did you have a good game?
Yes.

777
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:27,609
Hmm. And who won?
I did.

778
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,694
Oh.

779
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,071
I think Frank
is being rather gallant.

780
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:34,532
Ooh. Sandwiches.

781
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:39,454
Today I want to show you
another very important letter-

782
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:42,373
the letter "H."

783
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:47,295
"H" follows the letter
we learned yesterday- "G."

784
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:52,216
"A "-
Sybylla, we cannot interfere
with your mother's wishes.

785
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,302
The time will soon pass.

786
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,596
You would hardly recognize
your little sister.

787
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,765
She has blossomed
into quite a young lady.

788
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:01,601
Try and do good
where you are, dear.

789
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:04,437
We can't always get
what we would like in this world.

790
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,439
As in "hot."

791
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:12,153
"H."

792
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,031
Good shot, Jimmy.

793
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:27,418
Ma! Ma! Ma!

794
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,798
Hurry, Ma! Quick!

795
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:34,175
Hurry, Ma! Ma!

796
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:46,104
Mom! Mom, get her off me!

797
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:54,320
Ma! Ma!

798
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:12,964
# The day #

799
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:16,300
# Lulled by the moonlight #

800
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:20,304
# Have all passed away #

801
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:23,975
# Beautiful dreamer #

802
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:26,227
"When stooping o'er a thirsty rose,

803
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,814
she murmured,
'Frederick, fetch my hose."'

804
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,402
Page 25.

805
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:39,198
Twenty-four.

806
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,284
Up here.

807
01:24:42,453 --> 01:24:44,829
"The devil is dead.
There is no hell.

808
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,457
The devil is dead,
and all is well." Hmm.

809
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:50,126
"And I,

810
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:54,756
"the one that have
loved him the best,

811
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,049
"have grown...

812
01:24:57,134 --> 01:25:01,053
"to be past caring.

813
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:03,723
"I've grown...

814
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:08,186
"to be past caring,

815
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,772
"past...

816
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:12,774
"waiting...

817
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:15,693
and past wearing."

818
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:20,948
I suppose I should thank God
for one agreeable daughter.

819
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:24,368
If Gertie marries Harry Beecham,
it will be a blessing.

820
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:30,374
Your grandmother says he's come back
and has managed to regain possession
of Five Bob Downs.

821
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:33,336
He seems to spend
most of his time with Gertie,

822
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,505
who must enjoy his company.

823
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:21,634
Who's that?
It's me.

824
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:23,761
You gave me a start.

825
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:27,515
What are you doing out here?
Just thinking, really.

826
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,892
Been over to see Susie again?

827
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:32,228
Yeah.
Third time this week.

828
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:04,218
We wanna have
a serious talk with you, lovey.

829
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:07,722
Now-

830
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:12,268
Well, you see, we want you to know
that we like you...

831
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:14,562
and that you're being
a good girl.

832
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:18,065
It'd be different
ifyou had some property.

833
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,610
You see, our Peter,

834
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:24,238
he's almost as sure as made it
with Susie Duffy.

835
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:26,282
What are you talking about?

836
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:29,952
Oh, we've seen you...
going out at night.

837
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:32,455
We can't say
we blame you.

838
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:34,582
He's a good-lookin' lad.

839
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:37,251
But you don't have any property, you see,
like I said.

840
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:39,921
You don't think that-
You can't.

841
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,507
Oh, no.

842
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:46,844
There, there, lovey.

843
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:49,388
I told you it'd be too much
of a shock for her.

844
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:53,601
Come on.
No one ever really died of a broken heart.

845
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,978
You see, girl,

846
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:59,065
things being as they are,

847
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:01,692
we gotta send you home.

848
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:06,948
I've wrote a bit
of a letter for you.

849
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:09,116
Just to tell your ma.

850
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:13,913
And they don't have
to worry about the money,

851
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,248
not until things look up.

852
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:21,212
Come on.
Don't take it so hard.

853
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,965
There's plenty of other
nice fellas in the world.

854
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:27,760
Oh!

855
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,148
Stanley.

856
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:45,861
Could you see to Maisie
when you've finished separating the milk?

857
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:49,949
Come on. Oh! Oh, dear.

858
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:52,618
Come on.
Let's see how that cake's doing.

859
01:28:52,703 --> 01:28:54,745
Will you bring that in, Aurora?

860
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:58,749
There now.

861
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,477
Hey, you poor, wee thing.

862
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:21,814
You poor, wee thing.
We'll get you out. Come on.

863
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:23,941
Oh, lift up those legs.

864
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:29,030
Now, come on. Out you go.

865
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,282
Come on. Come on.

866
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:33,409
Come on.

867
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:37,329
Come on.
That's the way.

868
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:51,427
Do you need a hand?

869
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,101
Peeping and prying again, are you?

870
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,193
That's the boy.

871
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:09,320
Back to your mother. Come on.

872
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:24,710
It's good to
see you again, Syb.

873
01:30:24,795 --> 01:30:28,672
We heard from Grandmother
that you might be coming down.

874
01:30:30,801 --> 01:30:33,010
I must look a sight.

875
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:38,599
I'm glad
you saved Five Bob.

876
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:40,893
Oh, I was lucky, that's all.

877
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:47,983
Did- Did you find the answers
to all those questions?

878
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:51,320
I mean, what was wrong with the world-
Oh, yes.

879
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:53,989
Partly me.
Oh.

880
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:59,245
Well,

881
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,330
here I am.

882
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:07,169
Yes. I don't suppose you
thought it would be like this.

883
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:14,301
Aunt Gussie sends her love.

884
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:17,346
She's very keen
on me getting married.

885
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:21,142
Yes, I think
it's a good idea too.

886
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:23,144
Oh, Syb, do you?

887
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,312
Yes. Gertie's
just right for you.

888
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:27,398
She's everything I'm not.

889
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:30,568
Look, I've got to change.

890
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,321
Father's down in the paddock.

891
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:38,909
Syb! It's not Gertie I-

892
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:41,370
It's you.

893
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:43,956
It's you I want to marry.

894
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:51,463
Please, please understand.

895
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:54,842
You promised if I needed you-

896
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,011
I do, Syb.

897
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:02,725
I love you.
I want to marry you.

898
01:32:04,186 --> 01:32:06,187
Trust me, Syb.

899
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:09,064
It's me I don't trust.

900
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:11,525
Can't you see?

901
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:19,366
The last thing I want is-
is to be a wife out in the bush,

902
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:21,744
having a baby every year.

903
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:25,164
You can have
anything you want.

904
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,960
We can go to the city
as much as you like.

905
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:33,297
Dear, dear Harry.

906
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:40,387
Maybe I'm ambitious, selfish.

907
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:46,727
But I can't lose myself
in somebody else's life...

908
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:49,063
when I haven't lived my own yet.

909
01:32:53,944 --> 01:32:56,111
I want to be a writer.

910
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:01,408
At least I'm going to try.

911
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:04,161
But I've got to do it now.

912
01:33:06,081 --> 01:33:08,332
And I've got to do it alone.

913
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:13,504
Please try and understand.

914
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,432
I thought you loved me.

915
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:28,269
Harry.

916
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:31,772
Don't you love me even a little?

917
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:36,110
Oh, Harry.

918
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:40,406
I'm so near loving you.

919
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,618
But I'd destroy you.

920
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:46,870
And I can't do that.

921
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:26,035
"So now
I've written it all down.

922
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:30,205
"Why? To try
and make sense of it?

923
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:33,500
"It may come out sounding
like a couple of nails...

924
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:36,170
"in a rusty tin pot.

925
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:41,425
"My ineffectual life may be trod
in the same round oftoil.

926
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:47,097
"But I want to tell everyone
about my own people,

927
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:50,726
"how I love them and pity them,

928
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:52,936
"pity all of us.

929
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:57,900
"The sun is shining
on another day,

930
01:34:57,984 --> 01:35:01,028
"and hope is whispering in my ear.

931
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:05,032
"With love and good wishes to all,

932
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:07,076
"good night.

933
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,620
"Good-bye.

934
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:11,705
Amen."
