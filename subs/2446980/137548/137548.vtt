1
00:00:02,548 --> 00:00:04,277
Number 7.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,482
Number 7.

3
00:00:05,651 --> 00:00:06,174
Number 9.

4
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:08,478
Number 7 and 9.

5
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:11,987
Shall kiss with tongue or whatever.

6
00:00:12,157 --> 00:00:13,886
This is such a coincidence.

7
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:19,087
It's not the same for you and me.

8
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:23,900
How can you, how can you do that.

9
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:24,993
Please stop it.

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,503
Stop it.

11
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:28,301
I was just playing the game.

12
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:32,207
- Come here, you bitch!
- Let go!

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,913
How can you be mad at me
for playing the game?

14
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:40,608
I can't take this anymore.

15
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:44,121
Oh, you asked for it, bitch.

16
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:49,519
You must be number 9, I'm 7.

17
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:55,533
Oh my god, it's blood.
This is just too much.

18
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:58,729
So you think you can
throw a punch, you bitch.

19
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:03,736
Stop it, stop it.

20
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,539
You just broke my nose.

21
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:09,945
Take a look, you bitch!

22
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,952
Stop it, stop it.

23
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:19,957
Stop hitting her, Yoo-mi.

24
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:22,550
Hey, you mindless people.

25
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:28,565
You dirty bastards.

26
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:32,363
Why is this happening to me.

27
00:01:37,643 --> 00:01:39,577
You should learn to control your temper,

28
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:41,875
look at what you've done.

29
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:43,275
Hurry up.

30
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:48,683
Hey.

31
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:55,993
Didn't I tell you to concentrate
when we're working?

32
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:58,291
What is this?

33
00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:02,697
It's breath spray, you idiot.

34
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:06,898
It's for your breath before kissing.

35
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:45,333
I don't care anymore.

36
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:50,045
Fight all you like, but I don't care.

37
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,715
Who is it?

38
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:57,750
Who is it?

39
00:02:57,823 --> 00:03:00,155
- Young-chae.
- Sung-kook.

40
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:01,954
Why did you come here?

41
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:17,865
What are you doing here?

42
00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:25,880
I'm sorry about before.
I didn't mean to cause you trouble.

43
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:28,485
It's okay. It's not your fault.

44
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:30,688
It's just the way he is.

45
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:32,883
I sort of understand him, though.

46
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:35,288
I would be the same
if you were my girlfriend.

47
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:43,701
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

48
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,294
I don't know.

49
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:50,100
I know a really nice girl.

50
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:52,109
Do you want me to set you up?

51
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:57,012
Actually, there's someone I like.

52
00:03:58,283 --> 00:04:02,014
But she's not really interested in me.

53
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:04,214
She has a boyfriend.

54
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:06,120
And they have quite a history together.

55
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:09,420
What do you think I should do?

56
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:13,726
About what?

57
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,132
Do you think I should tell her how I feel?

58
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:20,729
Or should I just keep it to myself?

59
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,933
What would you do?

60
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:31,339
- Kyung-ah.
- Kyung-ah.

61
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,941
Young-chae...

62
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:37,250
If Yoo-mi finds out, she'll kill us both.

63
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:41,256
I'm not scared of her.

64
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:44,561
Open the door!

65
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:46,160
Open the door!

66
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:47,059
She's here!

67
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:50,965
Open the door.

68
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:53,866
Open the damn door.

69
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,974
Go to the porch.

70
00:04:57,142 --> 00:05:00,873
Can't you hear me? Open the door.

71
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:05,476
Open the door.

72
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:10,987
Can't you hear me? Open the door.

73
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:12,987
Open the damn door.

74
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:15,592
I was naked, so I was getting dressed.

75
00:05:16,862 --> 00:05:21,196
Hello. I know you're in here, you bitch.

76
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:23,097
I was all alone.

77
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:28,003
I wasn't finished talking to you, you bitch.

78
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:31,509
I just want to talk to you.

79
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:33,203
Are you in this room?

80
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:38,215
- I was all alone in this room.
- I just want to talk to you.

81
00:05:39,885 --> 00:05:42,217
You must be really uncomfortable in here.

82
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:47,920
Why you...

83
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:49,927
- I got you.
- Yoo-mi,

84
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,429
no There's no one there, Yoo-mi.

85
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:03,440
Gi-joo.

86
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:34,261
I'm so hot.

87
00:06:38,243 --> 00:06:40,268
My back hurts.

88
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:43,175
I wish someone would
undo my bra for me.

89
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,475
I can't seem to reach it
with my hands.

90
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:51,884
It's so hot in here.

91
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:59,397
Somebody must have put a pillow in here.

92
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:02,326
Let me get it.

93
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:05,596
I'm sorry, Sung-kook.

94
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,898
It's okay.

95
00:07:06,972 --> 00:07:09,702
When I heard that Young-chae
had come here,

96
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:11,105
I just lost it.

97
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:13,406
It's so hot in here.

98
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:21,510
Yes, then you should
take your clothes off.

99
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:27,224
I'm sorry I interrupted your shower.

100
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:31,228
Let me help you in the shower.

101
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:34,322
I don't want to shower.

102
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:41,238
- What are you doing?
- A nice cool shower Come on.

103
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:43,740
- A shower? After what you've just done?
- It's been awhile.

104
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:47,437
What's wrong with you? Stop.

105
00:07:47,512 --> 00:07:50,447
I don't want to shower.

106
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:59,047
So this is where it was.

107
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:03,553
It's actually mine. I was going to
wear it to the beach tomorrow.

108
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,554
- It's Young-chae's.
- Young-chae?

109
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:09,564
I was actually waiting for you to come.

110
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,984
Where could Young-chae be hiding?

111
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:00,412
Where is she?

112
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:03,613
The porch, the porch.

113
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:05,417
She went out to the porch.

114
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,149
Eun-sik says he's sorry,

115
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:35,049
and he asked us to bring you here, right?

116
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,350
You should give him another chance.

117
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:38,980
I'm sure he didn't mean to upset you.

118
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:49,693
Eun-sik.

119
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:53,069
Maybe he's sleeping.

120
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:54,435
I don't think so.

121
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:10,444
What the hell happened?
Why are you in my room?

122
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:30,104
That bitch.

123
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:33,105
I'm gonna kill you.

124
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:39,613
I won't let you off.

125
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:43,215
Eun-sik.

126
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:46,121
- Don't you have the key?
- I do.

127
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:47,715
Retard. Open it, then.

128
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:51,428
You prick, you.

129
00:10:53,098 --> 00:10:54,929
I've got you now.

130
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:30,361
So this is where everybody was.

131
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:33,663
You damn bitches.

132
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:00,988
Let's go!

133
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:03,891
Ready.

134
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:48,104
Thank you. Thank you so much.

135
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:51,107
It's nothing. Don't worry too much.

136
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:52,904
They'll take good care of her.

137
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:54,911
I'm counting on you, okay?

138
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:58,410
Eun-sik?

139
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:01,909
Hello.

140
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:06,721
Thank you Thank you so much, Gi-joo.

141
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,725
I really can't thank you enough.

142
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:12,729
It was my pleasure.
Besides, I didn't do much.

143
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:17,525
She ruptured a cross ligament in her knee.

144
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:22,937
She might not be able to swim again.

145
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:27,544
Oh god, my poor baby.

146
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:29,941
Don't worry.

147
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:32,448
I was thinking of taking Kyung-ah with me

148
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:35,145
when I go to study abroad this fall.

149
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,654
In America, they have rehabilitation

150
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:39,952
facilities that specialize in sports injuries.

151
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:43,960
I'll take good care of her and
make sure she gets treated.

152
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:46,460
So you don't need to
worry about a thing.

153
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:56,366
Why? Are you leaving?

154
00:14:56,541 --> 00:15:01,478
You have a guest,
and I have somewhere to go.

155
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:04,877
I have to go and meet a friend.

156
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:06,573
Is it because of my mother?

157
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,187
No, of course not.
I'm going to be late.

158
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:12,982
I'll call you later.

159
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:25,902
Eun-sik.

160
00:15:30,074 --> 00:15:33,510
I love you.

161
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:52,520
What did you and my mom talk about?

162
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:55,225
Why, are you curious?

163
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,927
Well, not really.

164
00:15:58,002 --> 00:16:02,234
I told her about my plan.

165
00:16:02,306 --> 00:16:03,933
What plan?

166
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:08,638
I told her I'd take you with me
when I leave for America this fall.

167
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:09,941
What?

168
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:11,948
You are going to be so busy.

169
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:13,040
You'll have to get a leave of absence,

170
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:14,948
and we'll have to find
a new school for you.

171
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:16,646
Gi-joo.

172
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:18,450
I'm really grateful for
what you've done.

173
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:20,457
I'll never forget about it.

174
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:23,851
But I don't want you to think that
it will change our relationship.

175
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,564
I'm sorry, I have to go.

176
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:31,559
I know you really like him.

177
00:16:32,136 --> 00:16:36,266
But shouldn't you give me a chance?

178
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:59,189
Young-chae.

179
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:05,998
I came because I had to tell you this.

180
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,300
I'm not afraid of Yoo-mi finding out
about this.

181
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:12,900
I don't care if she beats me to death.

182
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:16,003
I don't want to hide my feelings anymore.

183
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:20,614
If anyone asks me
whom I love the most,

184
00:17:20,685 --> 00:17:25,520
I can say this with certainty.

185
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,320
The woman I love the most is...

186
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:38,525
My mother.

187
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:48,709
She gave me life and took care of me...

188
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:50,541
<i>Kyung-ah's birthday!</i>

189
00:17:58,022 --> 00:18:00,047
Why don't you just go with him.

190
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:02,854
Listen to me it'll only do you good.

191
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:07,964
Stop it, I don't see
why I have to go with him.

192
00:18:08,132 --> 00:18:09,963
He's nothing to me.

193
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:13,160
Would you rather stay here with Eun-sik

194
00:18:13,337 --> 00:18:15,567
and be miserable all your life?

195
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,977
Mom, how can you say that?

196
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:22,874
Aren't you at least a little sorry to him?

197
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:24,674
Why should I be?

198
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,976
What has he done for you?

199
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:28,880
All he does is follow
you around like an idiot.

200
00:18:29,053 --> 00:18:33,990
He's the one who stood by my side
when I was at my worst.

201
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:36,991
He doesn't care that I have a past,

202
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:39,894
and he loves me
more than anyone else.

203
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:51,903
That's Kyung-ah.

204
00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:53,603
She's the one who slept
with her coach.

205
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:57,614
Crazy bitch. She's a tramp.

206
00:18:57,682 --> 00:18:59,616
She even tried to seduce her teacher.

207
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:00,708
- Really?
- Yes.

208
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:07,314
I couldn't live if I were her.

209
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:09,453
Crazy bitch.

210
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:10,323
Filthy bitch.

211
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,919
Whore.

212
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,643
<i>Kyung-ah, what are you doing tonight?</i>

213
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,942
<i>Could you come to</i>
<i>the practice room at?</i>

214
00:19:38,723 --> 00:19:40,657
Happy birthday to you,

215
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,249
happy birthday to you

216
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:46,453
Happy birthday dear Kyung-ah,
happy birthday to you.

217
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:53,162
You have to eat your birthday cake.

218
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:18,489
Eun-sik, I wish you would be
how you were in the past.

219
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:21,690
And just be a good friend to my daughter.

220
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,696
Actually, there's someone that

221
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:27,704
I would like Kyung-ah to marry.

222
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:31,498
But I think she's

223
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:34,203
hesitating because of you.

224
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,905
And I know I shouldn't be saying this,

225
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:46,212
but I don't like that you know her past

226
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:52,729
If you really love her.

227
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:59,327
You should let her go
so she can have a good future.

228
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:03,740
One day, you'll have children of your own.

229
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:08,142
And then you'll understand me.

230
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:11,037
I'm sure you'll do the right thing.

231
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,587
Help me, help me!

232
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:11,806
Yesterday was my birthday,
and he didn't even call me.

233
00:22:12,376 --> 00:22:17,006
I gave him a mouthpiece
so he would study hard.

234
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:20,908
I did so much for him...

235
00:22:28,492 --> 00:22:31,120
Does this make any sense to you?

236
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:34,926
Listen to me carefully.

237
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:42,531
I... mouthpiece... My heart...

238
00:22:42,606 --> 00:22:50,138
Does this make any sense to you?

239
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:53,249
Can you understand any of that?

240
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:13,169
Gi-joo, this is Kyung-joo. Yes...

241
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:16,966
Kyung-ah? She passed out.

242
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:30,980
Why did you drink so much?

243
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:35,485
Bad boy, he's a real bad boy.

244
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,687
I agree with you.

245
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:40,889
I didn't think he'd be like that either.

246
00:24:04,188 --> 00:24:06,213
Kyung-ah.

247
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,624
Why have you turned off your cell phone?

248
00:24:10,694 --> 00:24:11,922
I've been studying.

249
00:24:11,996 --> 00:24:13,930
But you never turned it off before.

250
00:24:13,998 --> 00:24:15,226
Is that why you came?

251
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,926
I need to talk to you.

252
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:18,525
I'm really busy.

253
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:20,331
It's important.

254
00:24:21,105 --> 00:24:22,936
What is the problem?

255
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:24,941
What problem?

256
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:26,738
Is it because of sex?

257
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:30,243
Is it because of Gi-joo?

258
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:34,746
Why are you acting like a child?

259
00:24:34,818 --> 00:24:37,651
You know I don't have feelings for him.

260
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:40,349
- Kyung-ah.
- What?

261
00:24:41,025 --> 00:24:43,255
Let's end things here.

262
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:46,061
What?

263
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,061
I've been thinking about it.

264
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:55,171
And I think it's better if we end things here.

265
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:03,570
Okay.

266
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,076
But I need an explanation.

267
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:10,982
Why do you want to break up with me?

268
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:13,180
There's no reason.

269
00:25:13,357 --> 00:25:16,690
I just want to break up with you.

270
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:18,989
It's because of Gi-joo, isn't it?

271
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:20,291
I told you it's not that.

272
00:25:20,364 --> 00:25:22,389
Then what is it?

273
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:27,103
I just don't want to do this anymore.
Why don't you get it?

274
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:31,004
I just don't want to do this.

275
00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:33,009
You just piss me off.

276
00:25:33,077 --> 00:25:36,979
It's okay, all relationships
go through these phases.

277
00:25:38,082 --> 00:25:40,107
Why don't you understand what I'm saying?

278
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:44,018
I just can't do this any more.

279
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:46,318
What are you so afraid of?

280
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:52,284
See, you can't even break up
with me properly.

281
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:57,631
I can date a girl with a past

282
00:25:57,701 --> 00:26:00,226
- But I don't think I can marry you.
- Stop it.

283
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:05,541
You're drunk.

284
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:08,143
Let's go.

285
00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:13,343
I really didn't want to have to say this.

286
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:16,643
Do I look like I'm stupid?

287
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:19,089
Look at me.

288
00:26:20,424 --> 00:26:24,861
How can I marry a girl
who used to sleep with her coach?

289
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:27,859
Think about it.
How can you pretend it didn't happen?

290
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:32,864
You're not even a virgin.
Why do you play so hard to get?

291
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:46,079
I never want to see you again.

292
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:21,935
Not the arm, use the shoulder.

293
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:23,632
What did I tell you?

294
00:29:23,707 --> 00:29:24,731
Swimming is all about feeling.

295
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:27,436
You have to really feel each movement.

296
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:30,446
Feel it.

297
00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:32,038
Get out of the way.

298
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:33,948
Gather around, everyone.

299
00:29:34,017 --> 00:29:36,542
Gather around, everyone.

300
00:29:38,322 --> 00:29:39,687
It's your turn.

301
00:29:40,123 --> 00:29:42,353
The National University K-1

302
00:29:42,526 --> 00:29:45,461
Championships will be held soon

303
00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:48,655
We have volunteered to cheer

304
00:29:48,832 --> 00:29:50,265
for our school's K-1 team.

305
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:52,061
Do you understand?

306
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:56,873
We're not cheerleaders.
Why should we cheer?

307
00:29:57,441 --> 00:29:59,466
Shut up!

308
00:30:00,043 --> 00:30:02,068
Now that your leave of
absence has been approved,

309
00:30:02,346 --> 00:30:03,574
let's get something to eat.

310
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:08,741
Can we eat some other time?

311
00:30:09,052 --> 00:30:10,883
Why?

312
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:13,887
I should say good-bye to my manager.

313
00:30:14,057 --> 00:30:16,582
Today is my last day here.

314
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,390
Okay, but starting tomorrow,
we'll be really busy.

315
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:22,990
So you should meet everyone
you need to meet today, okay?

316
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:24,897
Yes.

317
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:28,597
Bye. Call me.

318
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:49,422
Long time no see.

319
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:52,118
Yes, sure.

320
00:30:52,195 --> 00:30:54,425
I'm taking a leave of absence.

321
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,132
I'm leaving for America next week.

322
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:03,430
Good for you.

323
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:07,033
Congratulations on your exam.

324
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:09,542
Thank you.

325
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:14,043
Take care.

326
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:19,048
Bye.

327
00:31:23,026 --> 00:31:27,895
Eun-sik. Would you like to
have a drink with me?

328
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,579
What am I going to do
when I run out of toilet paper?

329
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:48,074
It was really nice
when you carried me on your back.

330
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:50,378
It was so cozy.

331
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:55,889
It must have been quite a strain on you.

332
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,393
I was such a bad girlfriend.

333
00:31:59,463 --> 00:32:01,693
No, I enjoyed it.

334
00:32:21,985 --> 00:32:23,213
Are you crying?

335
00:32:23,286 --> 00:32:25,516
Who's crying?

336
00:32:26,189 --> 00:32:27,713
You are crying.

337
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:32,928
I'm not crying.
What are you talking about?

338
00:32:32,996 --> 00:32:35,226
You're a man. Suck it up.

339
00:32:40,804 --> 00:32:44,433
Crybaby.

340
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:46,635
Go straight, straight.

341
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,170
Ma'am, this is not acceptable.

342
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:56,549
Gosh my head hurts.
I think the car handle is talking to me.

343
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,747
Just follow my instructions.

344
00:32:58,822 --> 00:33:00,551
Go straight.

345
00:33:00,624 --> 00:33:02,251
Stop!

346
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:05,051
Turn to the right.

347
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:09,556
Tada!

348
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:11,065
<i>Hotel Athens</i>

349
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:15,068
I really want to be with you tonight.

350
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,473
You can't.

351
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:20,971
Why not?

352
00:33:21,144 --> 00:33:22,270
You just can't.

353
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,480
Why?

354
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:28,074
You can eat anywhere you'd like,

355
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:31,687
but you should always sleep in one place.

356
00:33:32,556 --> 00:33:33,989
Don't you trust me?

357
00:33:34,157 --> 00:33:36,182
I promise I'll only hold your hand.

358
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:39,285
- Let's go.
- I do trust you.

359
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:41,592
Then what?

360
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:45,999
I don't have any money.

361
00:33:54,177 --> 00:33:55,508
Where are you going?

362
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:57,206
To the bathroom.

363
00:34:04,588 --> 00:34:06,613
Eun-sik.

364
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:09,520
Yes.

365
00:34:09,593 --> 00:34:11,720
Are you asleep?

366
00:34:13,396 --> 00:34:15,523
Yes.

367
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,329
How can you answer me if you're asleep?

368
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:24,337
- Eun-sik.
- Yes.

369
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:27,137
It's cold, come up here.

370
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,541
It's okay.

371
00:34:28,612 --> 00:34:30,637
Come up here.

372
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:38,044
I can sleep here, it's okay.

373
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:52,345
You have to win.

374
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:55,143
Don't be afraid to show off

375
00:37:55,218 --> 00:37:59,348
all the techniques
that I have taught you.

376
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:02,150
Let's go!

377
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:06,261
Seonjeong, Seonjeong, let's go!

378
00:38:20,243 --> 00:38:21,676
Hold up your guard.

379
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,903
Out!

380
00:38:55,378 --> 00:38:57,312
Turn, turn around the ring.

381
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:06,512
Go! Go! Go!

382
00:39:12,195 --> 00:39:13,127
Wake up, wake up.

383
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:15,426
Get up, get up.

384
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:17,830
Do you have your passport and everything?

385
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:20,228
Yes.

386
00:39:20,603 --> 00:39:23,333
Next up is the special event of the day.

387
00:39:23,406 --> 00:39:26,637
Denis Kang will take part in an invitation match.

388
00:39:26,709 --> 00:39:30,839
This is Denis KANG.

389
00:39:39,923 --> 00:39:41,857
What the hell is she doing there?

390
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:44,550
Denis Kang is entering the rin

391
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:52,426
That mindless bitch

392
00:40:09,252 --> 00:40:15,384
It is time to announce
Denis KANG's opponent

393
00:40:20,964 --> 00:40:21,896
From Seonjeong University...

394
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:25,492
- CHOI Sung-kook!
- I didn't look...

395
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:32,707
In today's super match,

396
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:34,606
Korean Denis KANG will be...

397
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:40,513
Today's match will follow MMA rules.

398
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,016
The match has begun.

399
00:40:44,988 --> 00:40:47,115
Punch him and fall back punch him
and fall back.

400
00:40:49,392 --> 00:40:50,916
Not there, Sung-kook.

401
00:40:51,794 --> 00:40:53,921
Crush him.

402
00:40:55,398 --> 00:40:57,525
Kill him.

403
00:41:09,712 --> 00:41:11,043
That's it.

404
00:41:14,017 --> 00:41:16,952
Hit harder.

405
00:41:30,533 --> 00:41:32,967
Is he dead?

406
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:50,281
Look straight at him.

407
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:55,858
stop it!

408
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:01,557
stop it!

409
00:42:06,269 --> 00:42:09,397
Can't you see the damn towel?

410
00:42:09,472 --> 00:42:12,999
Why did you have to beat him up?

411
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:34,422
Young-chae!

412
00:42:34,497 --> 00:42:37,728
There's something
I want to tell you before I die.

413
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,634
The woman I really love is...

414
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,442
Are you going to live there permanently?

415
00:42:49,512 --> 00:42:52,345
I think so.

416
00:42:52,415 --> 00:42:55,043
Did you say goodbye to Eun-sik?

417
00:42:58,121 --> 00:43:00,146
Oh my god.

418
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:04,853
You and I both have
the worst romances ever, don't we.

419
00:43:06,129 --> 00:43:08,654
Eun-sik asked me to give you this.

420
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:14,867
He texted you on
your birthday to give you this.

421
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:16,571
But your mother turned up instead,

422
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:19,071
and gave him a really hard time.

423
00:43:19,742 --> 00:43:21,175
What are you talking about?

424
00:43:23,146 --> 00:43:26,377
Shit, I'm so stupid.

425
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,280
He told me not to tell you.

426
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:50,305
<i>Kyung-ah, these are for you.</i>

427
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:52,603
<i>Don't ever hurt yourself again!</i>

428
00:43:53,476 --> 00:43:57,105
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't stay by</i>
<i>your side forever.</i>

429
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:01,313
<i>Take care!</i>

430
00:44:13,796 --> 00:44:17,926
<i>I won't say that I'm sorry.</i>

431
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,434
<i>Remember you promised that I could</i>

432
00:44:20,503 --> 00:44:23,233
<i>come back to Korea whenever I want?</i>

433
00:44:23,306 --> 00:44:26,742
<i>I've decided to act on that promise</i>
<i>I hope you understand.</i>

434
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:30,142
<i>You once said that Eun-sik</i>
<i>would never be able to forget me.</i>

435
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:33,740
<i>Well, I feel the same way for him.</i>

436
00:44:33,816 --> 00:44:36,944
<i>If I leave with you now</i>

437
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:39,146
<i>I'd be by your side,</i>

438
00:44:39,222 --> 00:44:41,554
<i>but Eun-sik would always be</i>
<i>on my mind.</i>

439
00:44:41,724 --> 00:44:43,851
<i>I couldn't bear to do that.</i>

440
00:44:44,026 --> 00:44:45,857
<i>I don't know if you have noticed,</i>

441
00:44:46,028 --> 00:44:48,963
<i>but there's someone</i>
<i>who is in love with you.</i>

442
00:44:49,232 --> 00:44:50,563
<i>Take care.</i>

443
00:44:54,036 --> 00:44:56,368
The next match is the
last match of the day.

444
00:44:56,539 --> 00:44:58,268
Please welcome Lee Yoo-han and

445
00:44:58,441 --> 00:45:01,171
Seonjeong University's CHANG Eun-sik.

446
00:45:25,268 --> 00:45:27,702
Thank you, Kyung-joo.

447
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,898
Please tell her I said goodbye.

448
00:45:30,973 --> 00:45:34,966
Sure, don't worry about her.

449
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:39,914
Out of sight, out of mind.

450
00:45:39,982 --> 00:45:44,919
We can make a fresh start once
we get to America.

451
00:45:45,288 --> 00:45:46,312
Excuse me?

452
00:45:46,389 --> 00:45:51,725
I will be visiting America very soon.

453
00:45:54,997 --> 00:46:00,936
You bastard, are you kidding me?

454
00:46:11,113 --> 00:46:14,241
You just made my day.

455
00:46:14,317 --> 00:46:15,944
Kyung-joo.

456
00:46:16,018 --> 00:46:18,248
Couple t-shirts?

457
00:46:18,321 --> 00:46:22,655
We got married. Look at my ring.
Give us your blessing.

458
00:46:25,728 --> 00:46:29,596
You have my blessing.

459
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:38,837
Be good to her.

460
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:43,876
A man is only as good as
how his woman makes him.

461
00:47:54,016 --> 00:47:56,041
Why aren't you getting up?

462
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,945
I am not going to let you off that easy.

463
00:48:00,723 --> 00:48:05,160
Get up.

464
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:10,362
Idiot.

465
00:48:39,762 --> 00:48:41,593
Eun-sik!

466
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:46,401
Eun-sik!

467
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:53,197
- Eun-sik!
- Are you okay?

468
00:48:55,077 --> 00:48:56,908
Are you okay?

469
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:03,211
I'm not going to leave you.

470
00:49:37,586 --> 00:49:40,521
I don't see anything right now.

471
00:49:40,623 --> 00:49:42,147
It's your mind, not your eyes that

472
00:49:42,324 --> 00:49:43,552
help you see in spiritual concentration.

473
00:49:43,726 --> 00:49:47,856
You'll see the real charm
of spiritual concentration today.

474
00:49:49,532 --> 00:49:51,056
Alright, come on.

475
00:49:52,735 --> 00:49:54,464
Wait.

476
00:50:03,245 --> 00:50:03,870
Come with me.

477
00:50:04,046 --> 00:50:07,174
I told you to wait, didn't I?

478
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:10,075
Come here.
Hurry up.

479
00:50:10,252 --> 00:50:12,482
Why are you picking on me?

480
00:50:12,555 --> 00:50:14,489
Are you standing up to me?

481
00:50:14,557 --> 00:50:18,084
Come here.
Hurry up.

482
00:50:35,277 --> 00:50:36,505
Don't you think it's too big?

483
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:37,705
What are you talking about?

484
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,307
In porn movies, they put fists in there.

485
00:50:41,383 --> 00:50:43,510
Eun-sik is not a porn star.

486
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:03,332
Okay.

487
00:51:06,008 --> 00:51:07,134
Get the camera.

488
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:10,142
You are so weird.

489
00:51:20,623 --> 00:51:22,215
It won't come out.

490
00:51:30,332 --> 00:51:31,822
Eun-sik.

491
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,367
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

492
00:51:42,645 --> 00:51:43,873
Do you have hemorrhoids?

493
00:51:44,046 --> 00:51:45,980
No, of course not

494
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:50,575
Eun-sik.

495
00:51:52,655 --> 00:51:55,089
My mom wants you to come visit us.

496
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,287
Okay.

497
00:52:00,963 --> 00:52:02,897
You're scared, aren't you?

498
00:52:04,066 --> 00:52:05,897
I'm not.

499
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:08,598
I can see it in your eyes.

500
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:10,104
You're scared, right?

501
00:52:11,974 --> 00:52:13,305
I'm not.

502
00:52:15,477 --> 00:52:18,412
- Where are you going?
- Bathroom.

503
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,176
Aw, you got nervous Push it out, man!

504
00:52:22,985 --> 00:52:24,213
What is that?

505
00:52:24,286 --> 00:52:26,015
They said it's a sucker.

506
00:52:26,088 --> 00:52:28,420
Why does he have a
sucker stuck up his ass?

507
00:52:29,191 --> 00:52:30,920
I really wouldn't know...

508
00:52:31,393 --> 00:52:33,623
Who the hell is this guy?

509
00:54:33,624 --> 00:54:34,624
