1
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.690
It doesn't make sense.

2
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.480
I don't understand how something
like this happened.

3
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.950
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

4
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.820
This has been my whole life,
and now it's gone.

5
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.870
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

6
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.040
Pendleton Industries is
all I've ever known.

7
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.540
And now it's all been taken away.

8
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.630
When someone sees a weakness in me,
I turn that weakness into a strength.

9
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.300
Danica, you're so strong.

10
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.810
I don't think I could do
anything like this.

11
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.690
You can imagine changing your life...

12
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.350
by fighting for the deed
to the land, Clarinda.

13
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.440
Which is only possible if Bartholomew
is no longer living.

14
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.700
You will never get
the deed to the land again.

15
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.780
I will never allow it.

16
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.290
Put down that gun,
you silly girl.

17
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.160
Watch your step, Bartholomew.

18
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.000
Ridge is on his way.

19
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.170
And he's still in love with Clarinda.

20
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.210
And Jared loves me.

21
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.960
Clarinda...

22
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.970
it's true.

23
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.220
I'm here for you.

24
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.610
This is the story of Joy,
as told by me, her grandmother.

25
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.750
Everybody starts out with some kind of dream
of what life will be.

26
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.380
Joy's dream started at this metal garage
her father ran.

27
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.770
Jackie, Jackie, bo-backie
Banana-fana, fo-fackie

28
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.730
Fee-fi, mo-mackie
Jackie

29
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.400
My granddaughter had a best friend,
Jackie.

30
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.570
Joy, Joy, bo-boy
Banana-fana, fo-foy

31
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.440
While shivering in my shoes

32
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.570
I strike a careless pose

33
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.570
A half-sister, Peggy.

34
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.700
A dog.

35
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.790
It's okay. It's okay, Mitzy.

36
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.460
A father.

37
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.670
A mother...

38
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.760
who is my daughter.

39
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.090
A grandmother. That's me.

40
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.110
She made many beautiful things
in her room.

41
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.490
Magic.

42
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.200
Some people love to make things.

43
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.040
They have the patience and the focus
to figure it out with their hands.

44
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.080
Joy was one of those people
who rejoiced in making things.

45
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.250
And I open the gate
to the big green meadow.

46
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.380
And I went into the forest.

47
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.300
And there, I conquered many dangers.

48
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.100
A wolf...

49
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.430
and other scary things.

50
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.640
And then I started to build
my very own house...

51
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440
where I would live...

52
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.770
and make wonderful creations
for all the world...

53
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.730
to see and have.

54
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.780
And maybe for the prince and princess...

55
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.530
who lived across the forest,
in the castle.

56
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.700
See?

57
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.120
And they were in love.

58
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.790
And maybe they'd invite me over...

59
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.830
because of the things that I made.

60
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.670
You need a handsome prince.
That's what you need. A prince.

61
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.550
No, I don't need a prince.

62
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.800
This is a special power.
I don't need a prince.

63
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.520
My daughter Terry is separated,
and alone in her room...

64
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.390
watching soap operas.

65
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.730
You can imagine changing your life...

66
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.810
by fighting for the deed
to the land, Clarinda.

67
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.900
I have something for you.

68
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.570
Oh, Danica...

69
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.650
You're so strong.

70
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.240
I don't think I could ever do
something like this.

71
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.660
I always felt it was for me
to encourage her.

72
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.290
So I said...

73
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.800
You are going to grow up and be a strong,
smart young woman...

74
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.390
go to school, meet a fine young man,
have beautiful children of your own...

75
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.970
and you're gonna build wonderful things
that you do in your room.

76
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.060
Okay?

77
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.600
What happened to this girl's dreams?

78
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.110
Watch this.

79
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.270
Mother, I can't find my lanyard for work.

80
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.530
They're not gonna let me through
airport security without it.

81
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.240
Joy, you can't find your lanyard?
Can I help you?

82
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320
No, but I...

83
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.450
Honey, listen.

84
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.830
I know life hasn't gone as we discussed
many times, sweetheart.

85
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.620
And you don't exactly have
your whole life ahead of you...

86
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.540
but you still have a good portion
of it, anyway.

87
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.460
Hope springs eternal.

88
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.210
-Thanks, Mimi.
-Sure.

89
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.970
Mother, look what I did find.

90
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.800
What is that?

91
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.850
How can you ask what this is?

92
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.930
The dog collar I invented
in high school.

93
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.060
Remember Mitzy choked a couple of times?

94
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.600
So I invented a dog collar
with a quick release...

95
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.860
so that a dog would never choke...

96
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.610
and I covered it with reflective tape,
plus it's a flea collar.

97
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.490
I probably wouldn't be late to this job
I'm going to...

98
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.240
if you'd gotten me a patent or a lawyer.

99
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.330
Joy the doer, Joy the doer.
You were always doing things, honey.

100
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.660
How could I be expected
to remember everything?

101
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.540
Now the Hartz company
has the patent to that collar.

102
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.620
I don't know how to get a patent.

103
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.880
What is that smell?

104
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.960
How did you get
yogurt down here, Mother?

105
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.670
I was wondering what that odor was.

106
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.840
It's starting to mold for Pete's sake.

107
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.100
Yes, I am, because I feel like I cannot
have the life bled out of me this way.

108
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.100
Joy, look who's back.
Look who's back!

109
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.640
Yes, Bartholomew is back.

110
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.650
No, no.

111
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.850
I thought Bartholomew was dead?

112
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.020
And I'm a ghost.

113
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.070
He came back as a ghost with
even greater powers.

114
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.280
Ghost, you go away!

115
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.360
My powers are even greater now.

116
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.490
I cannot handle this.
How is this possible?

117
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.120
Stay away from him.

118
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.030
Clarinda, you don't know
what a ghost can do to you!

119
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.660
Even from beyond the grave.

120
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.250
Grandma's gonna take you
to the birthday party, okay?

121
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.370
Five minutes.

122
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.420
Hi. What are you doing here?

123
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.800
I'm returning him to you.
I don't want him anymore.

124
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.960
What?

125
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.720
He's damaged.

126
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.340
He has no place else to go.

127
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.590
He's been living
in my house for two years.

128
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.680
Dad, I'm so sorry.

129
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.310
But you know,
Tony's living in the basement.

130
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.480
Your ex-husband shouldn't be living
in your basement.

131
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.440
That's not the proper way to be divorced.

132
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.690
Okay. I don't know
where I'm gonna put you.

133
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.610
Dad, don't go in there. Mom's in there.

134
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.280
You can have him back, Terry.
I don't want him anymore.

135
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.070
What was so much better about
being with Sharon, Rudy?

136
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.370
Dad, don't answer that.

137
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.490
We went to the Metropolitan Museum ofArt.

138
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.080
-What did you like at the museum?
-What did I like? I'll tell you what I like.

139
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.080
I like the ancient Roman statues.
I like the medieval armor.

140
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.920
I like the Etruscan jewelry.

141
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.710
-Museums are full of dust and death.
-I like going to the café...

142
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.880
having an espresso, a nice panini,
that's what I like.

143
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.130
You had a panini in a coffin, Rudy.

144
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.220
-A dusty, boring coffin. Yuck.
-Then why'd you ask me?

145
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.430
What are you, a crazy person?

146
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.220
It's like having a conversation
with an insane asylum person.

147
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.720
What else, Captain Jack?
What else was so great?

148
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.480
Captain Jack, you're calling me. Okay.

149
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.770
Yes, you're Captain Jack,
the flying jackass.

150
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.810
Yeah, and you know what you are?
You're like a gas leak.

151
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.610
-We don't smell you, we don't see you...
-I am not a gas leak!

152
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.270
-but you're killing us all silently.
-You take that back...

153
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.530
and tell me what else you did
with Sharon!

154
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.990
You creature from the Black Lagoon.

155
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.570
No! This conversation is over.

156
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.610
-I'm leaving. Good luck.
-Oh, my God. Here it goes.

157
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.570
Watch out, Joy. He's gonna snap!

158
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.830
Please. You want me to snap.
That's your whole routine. You...

159
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.990
Guard the china!

160
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.120
-Hey, Terry, you like this?
-Dad, no!

161
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.870
How's this for snapping?

162
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.630
-No! No.
-How's this?

163
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.290
This is snapping!

164
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.800
-Dad! Stop!
-He's disturbed, Joy!

165
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.260
He's a disturbed man!

166
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.220
-I'm disturbed?
-He's a damaged man!

167
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.010
You're right, I am disturbed.

168
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.640
You're the great disturber!

169
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.600
I'm sorry, honey.

170
00:08:58.770 --> 00:08:59.810
I don't like this.

171
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.560
You're not supposed to see
this kind of thing.

172
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.980
I'm very, very sorry.
I apologize sincerely.

173
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.150
lt's not gonna happen, okay?
We have other...

174
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.900
I'm gonna clean all this up.

175
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.650
Dad, no. Don't clean it up.

176
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.820
Dad, stop. Just don't, okay?

177
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.820
Stop. I'll do it.
I just want to get you out of this room.

178
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:19.950
Thank you.

179
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.700
Hi, guys.
I'm sorry about all the yelling.

180
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.910
Mimi's gonna take you
to the birthday party, okay?

181
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.540
Hi, my sweethearts.

182
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.710
-You broke things again.
-He did break stuff.

183
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.500
I did break some things,
but Grandma was wrong.

184
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.880
So I was a little wrong,
but she was really wrong.

185
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.170
But Grandpa's gonna come stay with us
for a little while.

186
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.680
Yay!

187
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.600
A sleepover with Grandpa! Yay!

188
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.270
Sharon never separated the wash.
The whites were always gray.

189
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.730
But you have that magic touch, sweetheart,
so could I give this to you, please?

190
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.730
Yeah, I'll take care of it, yeah.
Just get your bag.

191
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.440
What about my ledgers and all that stuff?
My accounting books?

192
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.730
I got them.
I'll get them to you later today.

193
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.400
-I love you, Grandpa.
-Love you.

194
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.940
-I did your taxes, I did your W-2s.
-Okay. Very important.

195
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.210
You suck!

196
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:11.800
What is he doing here?

197
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.050
Sharon brought him back...

198
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.220
so he's gonna stay with us until he finds
a new love or a new place to live.

199
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.640
You know how this goes.

200
00:10:19.464 --> 00:10:20.864
Joy, I can't have your dad here.

201
00:10:20.988 --> 00:10:23.688
What do you want me to do, Tony?
I have to work.

202
00:10:23.712 --> 00:10:26.612
I know, honey, but he's a nightmare,
we'll kill each other. I can't.

203
00:10:26.636 --> 00:10:29.036
I can't take any more of this.
Period!

204
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.190
Dad, up.

205
00:10:30.214 --> 00:10:32.714
We'll end up killing each other.
I don't like this!

206
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.860
This is not the proper way to be divorced,
the two of you.

207
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.490
You're gonna tell me how to be divorced?

208
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.070
I'm a provider, Tom Jones.
I have my own business.

209
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.740
I help Joy with the mortgage.
What do you do?

210
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.080
You sing all night
at Angela Starpoli's club.

211
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.330
You get repeatedly fired
from Campbell's Soup.

212
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.410
Okay, well I'm gonna divide
the basement.

213
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.330
I'm divorced.
I can do whatever I want, Rudy.

214
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.880
This is not the proper way to be divorced.

215
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.630
And I'm about to be late for work.

216
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.380
So please try not to fight
in front of the children, okay?

217
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.590
Especially not physically.

218
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.260
Rudy, you see this?
This microphone here?

219
00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.510
You touch it, and I kill you.

220
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:05.930
Okay. I'm leaving.

221
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.100
Please try not to kill each other
while I'm gone.

222
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.350
You've gone mad. This is all your fault!

223
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.270
Clarinda. Clarinda! Don't.

224
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.230
Clarinda, something terrible happened!
Stay away from him!

225
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.700
Oh, my God.
I thought I fixed this thing.

226
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.780
Nice job, Joy. Nice job.

227
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.910
Peggy? What are you doing here?

228
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.420
What's the matter with you?
Sending Grandma Mimi with her arthritis...

229
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.210
to take them to their friend's birthday?

230
00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.540
I'm fine.

231
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.800
They have a much better time
with me anyway, with Aunt Peggy.

232
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.090
But I wasn't stupid enough to get into
a bad marriage and have a couple of kids.

233
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.430
Don't bother your sister, Peggy.

234
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.010
I'm gonna talk to Dad about business.
All right?

235
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.810
You gonna come bring the books
by the garage later?

236
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.480
Yeah, I'm gonna bring them later.
He's in the basement.

237
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.640
I'm joking with you.

238
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.940
Yeah. I know.

239
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.270
Kids, we're gonna do
something fun later, okay?

240
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.110
We're doing something fun now.

241
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.160
Oh, we found your luggage
but it's in Cleveland.

242
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.950
So now we just need to get it back
to New York City.

243
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.240
I'm filing a complaint.

244
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.250
My husband needs his medication.

245
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.210
What's your name? Joy?

246
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.170
You don't seem joyous to me today.

247
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.130
Perhaps I am not so joyous today.

248
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.050
-Joy, I think you're getting demoted.
-Hi, how you doing?

249
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.090
Listen, I need you to speak
to the supervisor.

250
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.890
We're gonna be having some changes,
and you're gonna be going to the night hours.

251
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.800
-Night hours? Tom, I can't work night hours.
-And we're having cutbacks.

252
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.470
-I've got two kids.
-Joy, I'm sorry.

253
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.680
Good luck.

254
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:29.810
Bye, Susan.

255
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.660
I'm not paying for metal
that I haven't gotten.

256
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.710
On top of me send...
You know, he wants to get paid.

257
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.960
He doesn't send an invoice,
and he hasn't even sent the metal.

258
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.050
But why doesn't he just send the invoice?
Send the invoice, I'll pay him.

259
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.630
Yep. That's it. Send the invoice.

260
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.180
Hi. Dad, I want to thank you again
for helping with the mortgage.

261
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Yeah.

262
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.270
I settled the accounts, balanced the books.

263
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.310
Thank you.

264
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.980
I'm sorry business is so bad, Dad.

265
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.560
I don't think that
that crazy gun range is helping.

266
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.520
How is that still legal?

267
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.400
-What can I do?
-After all these years?

268
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.280
They keep to themselves.

269
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.320
It's their property.
The police leave them alone.

270
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.200
Why? You think it's costing us business?

271
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.700
I don't think it's helping.

272
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.080
Well, if you wanna help, why don't you
come here and manage this place?

273
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.920
You know, I'd like to go the next level.
Put on a nice suit.

274
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.040
You know, go out there
and get some accounts.

275
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.880
Yeah, this is 9873.
Just checking my mailbox.

276
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.220
What is that?

277
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.510
Yeah, I have a pen. What is it?

278
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.180
13-14. That's it?

279
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:49.600
Thank you.

280
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.100
What was that?

281
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.390
It's a 900 number.

282
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.850
What's a 900 number?

283
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.110
It's, you know, a dating service
for widows and widowers.

284
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.440
Dating service?

285
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.860
You're not a widow or a widower.

286
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.280
What's the difference? I'm single.

287
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.280
I meet nice ladies.
Maybe we fall in love.

288
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.910
I have to fall in love or I'm not interested.
You know me.

289
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080
I know, Dad.

290
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.910
Sharon was no good for him.
It's nice for him to meet somebody new.

291
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.080
-I got him some new clothes, you know?
-Okay. Okay.

292
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.710
-Hello? Is this 7633?
-It's good., THEN JOY TO PEGGY

293
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.830
-Okay. I love you. See you later.
-Yes?

294
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.880
Bye.

295
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.710
Hi. This is 9833.

296
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.300
Hi! Hi, how are you?

297
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.880
What a nice voice you have.

298
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:28.470
Thank you.

299
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.640
-Oh, an accent.
-Yes.

300
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.060
I am from Italy.

301
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.810
Oh! Continental.

302
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.640
What is your name?

303
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.480
My name is Rudy, what's yours?

304
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:38.480
Trudy.

305
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.690
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

306
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.900
Your name is Trudy?

307
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.070
Yes!

308
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.480
Rudy and Trudy. I love it.

309
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.360
Let's figure out when we're gonna meet.

310
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.570
That's a good idea. Let's have dinner.

311
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.240
-I could come pick you up.
-Yeah.

312
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:52.740
I have a green Mercedes.

313
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.870
Okay, 6:30? I'll be ready.

314
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.160
Ciao.

315
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.670
Good luck with your date, Dad.

316
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.080
Thank you. I'm excited.

317
00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.750
What do you think you're gonna wear?

318
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.380
Polo by Ralph Lauren.

319
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.340
Did you have to use
the whole bottle of cologne?

320
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.430
Tony!

321
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.140
You smell like my grandmother.
He smells like my grandmother.

322
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.850
Hey, please. Don't make me tense.

323
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.060
Don't stress me out.
I gotta stay nice and loose.

324
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.850
-Now you're tense?
-I'm tense. You're making me tense.

325
00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.270
-Guys, stop. Please.
-I'm making you tense?

326
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:20.940
My carriage awaits.

327
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.360
Have a great date.

328
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.520
Wish me luck.

329
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.770
You don't need it.

330
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.320
Joy, water!

331
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:28.490
Where are my cufflinks?

332
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.410
Mommy, come read to me!

333
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.530
Five minutes, Cristy.

334
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.910
Mother, again?

335
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.490
Yeah, you just sit right there.
Are you comfortable?

336
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:42.170
How many times do I have to tell you
not to clean your brushes out in the sink!

337
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.710
Danica thinks it's unladylike
to toss things in the toilet.

338
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.050
And I happen to agree.

339
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.510
Yeah? Well, why don't you have
Danica do your plumbing then?

340
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.220
Danica can direct her power
anywhere Danica chooses.

341
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.850
That is the power of Danica.

342
00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.770
Oh, my God.

343
00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.190
If this problem gets any worse...

344
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.440
we're gonna have to move you
into a different room.

345
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.070
That means no TV.

346
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.440
That could be very scary for you.

347
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.320
Don't let that happen, Joy.
This is my comfort nest.

348
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.330
We're gonna need to get
a plumber in here.

349
00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.580
What?

350
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.040
There's gonna... A man in my room?

351
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.420
Well, I don't know any female plumbers
other than me.

352
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.960
Well, can't you fix it, Joy?

353
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.590
This has surpassed my capabilities.

354
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.880
Thanks, Joy.

355
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.720
"The cicada is a large flying insect
two to three inches long.

356
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.430
"It makes a sound of up to 120 decibels,
louder than some telephones.

357
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.850
"It lives half of its life above ground
evading predators.

358
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.640
This is the book you wanted me
to read to you, Cristy?

359
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.230
How did this book even get in the house?

360
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.270
Aunt Peggy got it for me.

361
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.860
She said the reason I like cicadas
is because they fill the air with sound...

362
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.110
which makes the house less lonelier for me.

363
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.120
Aunt Peggy tells you how you feel
about the house being lonely?

364
00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.780
Aunt Peggy tells me a lot of things.

365
00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.330
Keep reading, please.

366
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.290
I don't want you
listening to Aunt Peggy too much.

367
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.830
Okay. Why?

368
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.500
"The cicada,
a symbol of rebirth in many countries...

369
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.340
"digs into the ground and stays buried
for up to 17 years."

370
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.050
That's such a random number.
Why 17 years?

371
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:17.970
It doesn't even say why.

372
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.140
I understand the four seasons in a year...

373
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.730
but why would something
stay hidden for 17 years?

374
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.600
That's just unsettling.
I'm not reading this.

375
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.820
You're sleepy anyway.
We gotta go to bed.

376
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.820
I wanna sleep with Nana.

377
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:33.490
No, you should sleep upstairs
in your room.

378
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.200
I want Nana.

379
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.950
All right. Well, watch out.
There's a hole here.

380
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.130
Just going to lay down for a second.

381
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.340
I feel like I'm in a prison.

382
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.090
No, Bartholomew's the ex-con
in the story.

383
00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.220
And Clarinda doesn't even know about it.

384
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.010
But Danica's onto him.

385
00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.850
They all blame Clarinda
but Danica's gonna get to the bottom of it.

386
00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.100
No. No.

387
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.690
Yes. It was you Clarinda.

388
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.190
I will get to the bottom of this.

389
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.860
You've made terrible mistakes.

390
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.440
It was Clarinda!

391
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.280
Oh.

392
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400
Look who's here.

393
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:16.700
Look who's here.

394
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.070
Look who's here.

395
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.390
We are here today
to remember what was lost...

396
00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.850
seventeen years ago.

397
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.060
Do you remember?

398
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.650
Peggy comes with me.

399
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.860
Joy spends half the time with us.

400
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.070
We'll take her paper forest.

401
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.400
That's Joy's special thing,
and it belongs in this house.

402
00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:58.660
No, I...

403
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.960
Joy.

404
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.960
Joy, wake up!

405
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.420
Someone's been ringing the doorbell.

406
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.650
Jackie!

407
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.150
Oh, thank God! It's you.

408
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.690
What happened? I'm worried about you.
I don't see you any more.

409
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.610
You don't come to the PTA.

410
00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.990
You know how my mom's always clogging the sink
with her hair from the brushes?

411
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.450
With the pipes in her room?

412
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.410
Yeah. She did it again.

413
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.540
Again?

414
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.790
Yes, and I had to
bash open a hole in the floor.

415
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.750
There's a huge hole in the floor
of my mother's room and I'm broke.

416
00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.010
My father works hard.
He's had some bad breaks.

417
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.890
I hope he gets another girlfriend,
and he'll move out of the basement.

418
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.680
He's in the basement with Tony?

419
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.560
Yes. And they hate each other.

420
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.520
Yes.

421
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.860
It's a disaster.
They won't stop fighting.

422
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.570
I don't know.

423
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.530
But how are you?
How's the family? How is everybody?

424
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.740
Everybody's okay.

425
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.030
How's work?

426
00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.990
My job, I could take it or leave it.

427
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.000
What happened to us, Jackie?

428
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.670
All the things
that we used to dream about.

429
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.790
I feel like they just keep getting
farther and farther away.

430
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.920
Remember the night of the party
where everything started?

431
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.840
The band was playing.

432
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.930
Everything was so exciting.

433
00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.430
Joy, you came!

434
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.100
I'm so glad you came!
This is my boyfriend, Andre.

435
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:51.520
-Hi, Andre.
-Nice to meet you.

436
00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.390
Andre, this is my childhood friend, Joy.

437
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.020
Come inside!

438
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.520
-Wow.
-Check my music class, accountant girl.

439
00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:58.820
This is a class?

440
00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.940
Yes!

441
00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.820
Don't turn on the lights
'cause I don't wanna see

442
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.280
Mama told me not to come

443
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.370
-They're so good!
-They are! The teacher's band.

444
00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.870
Mama told me not to come

445
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.370
Mama told me not to come

446
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.040
She said,
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"

447
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.960
"That ain't the way to have fun"

448
00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.380
Mama told me not to come

449
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.260
Mama told me not to come

450
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.300
-Who's the bald guy?
-That's our music teacher.

451
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.510
And he has all this...
This is his house?

452
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.020
-Yeah, this is his house.
-Wow.

453
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.430
He's from Venezuela.

454
00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.140
-Who is that guy?
-Yeah.

455
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.400
That's the music teacher's son.

456
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.610
Oh, my gosh.

457
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.240
You're dancing. Here you go.

458
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.330
What am I doing now?

459
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.580
-You're dancing.
-No.

460
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.120
-Let me show you my father's house.
-What?

461
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:54.410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

462
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.120
I'm gonna be a singer.

463
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.420
Really?

464
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.090
Yeah. I'm gonna be
the next Tom Jones.

465
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.420
That's a big ambition.
There's only one Tom Jones.

466
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:07.090
I know, but you can't let the practical
get you down.

467
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.180
You gotta keep going to what you love.

468
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.100
That's true.

469
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.890
That's what my father taught me.

470
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.600
What about you?

471
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:26.860
I invented a dog collar that I want to get patented,
but I don't think it ever will.

472
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.660
I was valedictorian in high school.

473
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.250
I got into a college in Boston...

474
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.460
but I'm staying here
because my parents are getting divorced...

475
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.790
and I'm staying to help my mom.

476
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.760
And I help my dad with business stuff.
Accountant.

477
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.590
Maybe your dreams are on hold right now.

478
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.050
No?

479
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.810
That's a nice way of putting it.

480
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.890
This song is going to be
in the town musical.

481
00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.640
We should sing it together.

482
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.440
I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time

483
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.530
To spend an evening with me

484
00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:07.820
That's really nice.

485
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.110
Okay, go.

486
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.490
-No.
-Okay.

487
00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.830
And if we go someplace to dance

488
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.910
I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me

489
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.660
He gave my girl a spring in her step,
just when she needed it.

490
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.000
What are we doing? Tony.

491
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.670
He got her to do the musical,
something she never would have done.

492
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:39.310
I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time

493
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.770
To spend an evening with me

494
00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.650
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance

495
00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.160
You won't be leaving with me

496
00:23:54.030 --> 00:24:01.040
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two

497
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:10.300
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid like "I love you"

498
00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.310
I can see it in your eyes
That you despise the same old lies

499
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:19.730
You heard the night before

500
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.150
You're so smart, you're so beautiful,
I... I just...

501
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.400
You could have married anybody.

502
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.900
You could have married a doctor, a lawyer,
a nice man instead of this...

503
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.490
I don't even know what to call this guy.

504
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.320
Are you seriously talking about this right now?

505
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.410
It's still not too late.

506
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.700
Dad.

507
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:41.750
Let's go.

508
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.210
Think about it.

509
00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.380
Dad!

510
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.940
We are a loving family, a solid family.

511
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:10.400
I've been married to my wife...

512
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:11.740
Now I have a speech.

513
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.360
He wasn't finished, Dad.

514
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:14.950
He's finished now.

515
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.240
I had two failed marriages.

516
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.620
The daughter from my first marriage, Peggy...

517
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.960
has a lot of tension with the daughter
from my second marriage, Joy.

518
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:30.670
I was married to Joy's mother
for 18 miserable fucking years.

519
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.880
Dad! That's just mean! Sit down!

520
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.380
But I got out of all that.

521
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.640
And I finally met the light of my life, Sharon.

522
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.310
-To you, baby.
-Dad!

523
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:40.510
You're my guy.

524
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.680
I toast you.

525
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.140
Dad! Stop!

526
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.140
-Will you stop it?
-Rudolph, please! Enough.

527
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.150
-Are you happy now?
-Fairly happy, yes.

528
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.900
Look what I found.

529
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.190
The divorce glass.

530
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.820
Salud.

531
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.280
I give these kids 50-50 odds.

532
00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.780
Salud, everybody. Have a good time.

533
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.870
Tony, wake up!

534
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.370
Please! Cristy hasn't eaten,
Tommy needs to be changed.

535
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.090
Oh, Cristy. What are you doing?

536
00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.670
-Get up. I just told your boss you're going to work!
-But what did you lie for?

537
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.880
-Because you're gonna lose anotherjob!
-No, honey, I'm sick!

538
00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.880
You're not sick, you're hungover!

539
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.390
That's not who I am!
I'm a singer, that's what I do!

540
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:19.970
You're not making any money singing!

541
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.890
Get in your car right now
and go get yourjob!

542
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.850
You're trying to turn me
into someone I'm not!

543
00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.390
I can't do this!
I can't do this, Tony!

544
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.060
I am losing my mind!

545
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.320
I don't wanna end up like my family.

546
00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:00.760
Time moves forward.

547
00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.140
Time moves backwards.

548
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.310
Time stands still.

549
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.530
Do I live up to my profile
or do I fall short?

550
00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.910
Are you kidding?
You're a banana flambé with extra rum.

551
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:26.040
You're a trip to the moon
on gossamer wings.

552
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.370
Wow! You're so poetic and romantic.

553
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.460
It's true!

554
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.290
Just like my late Morris.

555
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.460
Morris. Now, he was American and you're Italian,
and your name originated how?

556
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:38.720
My name. My Italian name is Geltrude.

557
00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.800
Geltrude.

558
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.510
And then he called me "Trude,"
and then became more American. "Trudy."

559
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:44.970
Trudy.

560
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:49.560
Why don't you come with your entire family,
on my late Morris' boat?

561
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.100
Bring the children,
bring the grandchildren.

562
00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.610
Like a motorboat?

563
00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.440
No, no, it's a sailboat. 55 feet.

564
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:57.610
-Wow. That's big. That is big.
-Yeah. Yeah.

565
00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:58.940
Yeah, I would love to.

566
00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.070
We'd bring some nice food,
something to drink, that would be great.

567
00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.120
Yeah, but not red wine,
because it might stain the teakwood deck.

568
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.410
It's very precious.

569
00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.160
Okay, understood. No red wine.

570
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.250
I got the red wine!

571
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.460
No, no, no, I'm sorry,
you can't have red wine on the boat.

572
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.630
No red wine, Tony. No red wine.

573
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.380
Why? It's a beautiful wine!

574
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.720
What's Tom Jones doing here anyway?
Who invited him?

575
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.300
He's here to help me with the kids.

576
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.180
I brought Peggy to help.

577
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.930
Peggy says mean things
about me to my children, so...

578
00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.430
I say nice things about you, too.

579
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600
It's a beautiful wine.

580
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.810
You have an accent, too!

581
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:29.810
Yes.

582
00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.190
Where are you from, paesano?

583
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.600
Paesano? Don't encourage him, please.

584
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:34.900
I'm from Venezuela, darling.

585
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.110
Do you know this song?

586
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.040
I can see why she still loves him!

587
00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:54.460
Come on. Come on board.

588
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.420
-This is gonna be a disaster.
-Dad.

589
00:28:57.544 --> 00:28:58.549
Welcome everyone.

590
00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:59.550
Cheers!

591
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.220
I dressed for boating but I didn't realize
how cold it was gonna be.

592
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:08.510
My late husband Morris, I met him in Milano
for a trade show for his swimwear line.

593
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.430
He used to say, "Sailing in the winter...

594
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.100
"is the best comparison
to life in the world of commerce."

595
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.200
Oh, no!

596
00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.210
Morris' teakwood deck!

597
00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.920
Yeah. Grand adventure. Great.

598
00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.710
Nice work, Tom Jones.

599
00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:44.510
Trudy, I know that it's upsetting,
but wouldn't Morris say, "What a grand adventure?"

600
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.760
Yeah, you're right. No big deal.
He's probably laughing up in heaven.

601
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.600
We should have used paper cups.

602
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.270
No, but it's not the same thing.

603
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.680
You need a nice glass
for a beautiful wine, you know?

604
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.400
Oh, boy.

605
00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.610
Look. It's a piece of glass
right in her hand.

606
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.950
Are you all right, honey?

607
00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.160
Yeah, she's thinking of something, Tony.

608
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:14.750
One loop. One continuous thing.

609
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.880
She's talking to herself. It's strange.

610
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.420
Honey, you should go to bed.

611
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:24.130
If it was all one continuous loop. Yeah.

612
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.470
Hi, I'm Touissant.

613
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.510
Touissant? Who's this guy?

614
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:31.470
It's not for me. Is it for you?

615
00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.640
No, it's not for me, man.

616
00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:33.930
The plumber.

617
00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.270
What's he here for?

618
00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:37.060
What do you think? Terry.

619
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.850
Terry. Oh, Terry.

620
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.400
Oh, no, wait. What's going on?
What is this man doing in my room?

621
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.730
This is...

622
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.740
-Touissant.
-Touissant.

623
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.030
Terry, Touissant.

624
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.160
Well, I mean, I've taped my show...

625
00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.540
and then, well,
exactly how long is this going to take?

626
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.460
Well, it shouldn't take more than a day.

627
00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.000
What accent is that, Joy?

628
00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:01.590
What country is that from?

629
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.300
-Haiti.
-Haiti.

630
00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.510
Haiti?

631
00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.130
It's French and Creole.

632
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:08.550
French and Creole.

633
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.390
Well, is there any way...
Could you please put a curtain up here...

634
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.600
so that I can come and go in my room
and watch my show while he's still working?

635
00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.480
Of course. I have a stapler.

636
00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.980
Thank you, sir.

637
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.650
You're welcome, mademoiselle.

638
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:20.940
Mademoiselle?

639
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.360
Good luck in here
and good luck with the... that.

640
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.650
Why don't you go to bed?

641
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.990
Keep going up the stairs.
Go to bed.

642
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:35.160
I don't want to go to sleep.
I don't want to have that horrible dream.

643
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:38.580
Come on! You can't have the same dream twice.
It never happens.

644
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.920
-It's impossible.
-That's not true.

645
00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.420
I had the Peggy dream so many times
when I was younger...

646
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:44.840
with the masks and the robe.

647
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.460
It doesn't make sense. No, no.

648
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.970
You can't have the same dream twice.
Maybe it's the...

649
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:50.380
Rudy, she's thinking about something.

650
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:53.050
Maybe it's a good dream,
and she's working something out.

651
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.600
I don't wanna work anything out.
I just want a nice, dumb sleep.

652
00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.230
Let's knock her out.
Give her a children's cough medicine.

653
00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:00.690
-That's what does it.
-Is that safe?

654
00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:02.060
No. It's not safe.

655
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.310
It's expired.

656
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.860
Go on, there. Knock it back, honey.

657
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:09.030
-No.
-Okay, one more. Knock it down. Come on.

658
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:10.780
-Rudy!
-Do it, Tony.

659
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:12.530
-I don't know.
-Just do it. One more.

660
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:13.620
Okay, one more.

661
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.080
Enough with this! That's it.
I'm gonna make her a hot toddy.

662
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.370
That's what she needs.

663
00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.580
You're gonna intoxicate her.

664
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.460
It's all natural, it's all herbal.
Nothing strong.

665
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:27.880
I was kidnapped by another monk,
who was from Switzerland.

666
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:36.390
And it turned out that this monk
was a duke of a royal family.

667
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.810
I shouldn't say "was,"
because he still is.

668
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:42.690
Leave me alone.

669
00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:45.520
I don't think we should let her
sleep on the stairs.

670
00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.570
Let's just put it here in the couch, okay?

671
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:03.710
Seventeen years.

672
00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.500
Think about it. We've been hiding...

673
00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.420
for seventeen years.

674
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.680
Seventeen years.

675
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:16.600
We used to make things.
Seventeen years ago.

676
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.430
Then, that all stopped.
What happened?

677
00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.350
When you're hiding, you're safe...

678
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.480
because people can't see you.

679
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.780
But, funny thing about hiding...

680
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.570
you're even hidden from yourself.

681
00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.630
Baby, what's the matter?

682
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.840
Tony, you need to move out
of the basement.

683
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.590
You need to get your own house.

684
00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.220
What? Why?

685
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.300
Because I go out at night
and sing at Angela's club?

686
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.600
-Is that it?
-No.

687
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.060
Because we've been divorced
for two years.

688
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:03.730
We need to move on.

689
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.190
You need to move out.

690
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.730
Rudy, you need to move out, too.

691
00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.770
What?

692
00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.980
There's more room in the basement
for me now.

693
00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:12.690
And another thing, Rudy.

694
00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.110
Tomorrow, I would like to have a meeting
with you and Trudy at your office...

695
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.820
to discuss her investing
in the manufacturing of my new idea.

696
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.200
No.

697
00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.120
I'm still getting to know her
and falling in love.

698
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:24.500
I can't do that. I won't do that.

699
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.370
And what manufacturing idea?
What are you talking about?

700
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.170
I have always been there for you,
no matter what.

701
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:33.800
I didn't go away to school.

702
00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:36.590
I stayed to help you and Mom
through the divorce and do your accounting.

703
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:39.390
I let you live here whenever you want...

704
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.640
no matter what it is.

705
00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:46.850
I am respectfully asking
for the favor that you owe me.

706
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.980
If you look into your heart,
you'll know that I'm right.

707
00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:00.780
Cristy, I need to use your crayons,
your colored pencils and your paper.

708
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.040
Let's go to my room.

709
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.110
You're not gonna believe this.

710
00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.410
So, you know that plumber
that you recommended?

711
00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:43.620
Yeah, Touissant.

712
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:47.410
So I hire him, Terry freaks out,
completely disoriented.

713
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.080
Hasn't had a man in her room
for eight years, since Rudy.

714
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.920
Makes me hang a drop cloth.

715
00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:53.090
The way I look at it...

716
00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:56.590
is that this is an opportunity
for you to invest in a new business...

717
00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.260
...that'll mean more money for you.

718
00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:03.510
Tell Rico, Dad. Number five's gotta go off.

719
00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.470
Rico, number five, no, off.

720
00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.890
Go off! Thank you!

721
00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.270
It's a standard handle, 53 inches.

722
00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.440
The sleeve connects to the mop head.

723
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:16.780
Now, this is where it gets complicated.

724
00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:20.200
There's a clip
that connects the sleeve to the...

725
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.280
I don't even know what to call it.
The "cup. "

726
00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.330
Which is connected to the mop head.

727
00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:28.950
So, when you pull up on the sleeve,
the mop head stretches...

728
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.670
so you can wring it
without ever touching it with your hands.

729
00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:35.210
The only thing we see
is this crayon drawings.

730
00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.750
We can't make heads or tails.

731
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.760
We don't know what it is.

732
00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.510
So, the mop doesn't hang loose, like hair?
Like a string?

733
00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.800
It hangs, but not on loose,
open ends like hair.

734
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.600
It's one continuous loop.

735
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.850
-I don't get it.
-I don't get it.

736
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:50.310
-I don't get it. What's he doing here?
-What's he doing here?

737
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.480
He is the father of our children,
and my friend, and he looks out for me.

738
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:03.490
We're doing an invention.

739
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:05.030
Cheers.

740
00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:06.700
Right.

741
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:10.620
Yes we are, Cristy.

742
00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.170
It's very serious.

743
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:15.330
It's priority.

744
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.840
Yes it is.

745
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.840
And I'm helping.

746
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.590
Yes you are.

747
00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.600
It's done like that, in Haiti.

748
00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:34.020
Touissant is teaching me
how to speak French.

749
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.560
And the word for "industrious" is...

750
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.320
Yes.

751
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.190
At first I thought maybe
something scary would happen...

752
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.280
like what happened with Danica
while she was kidnapped by a man...

753
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:48.030
who turned out to be in hiding
from the royal family in Switzerland...

754
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.410
and then she moved to Switzerland.

755
00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.790
Of course, she befriended that man
and more.

756
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.170
Don't ever try and limit me, Joy.

757
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.330
And let me know if you want some
of this Chakalaka.

758
00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.460
Chaka. Say "chaka."

759
00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.460
Chaka.

760
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:00.500
It's very good.

761
00:38:02.024 --> 00:38:04.224
- See you soon.
- Goodbye.

762
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.180
Hey, Rocky. Hey, Tom!

763
00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.230
Take her inside the office.

764
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.600
-Hey, Tino.
-Hey, Joy.

765
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.650
I wanted to show you something.

766
00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.230
So, will you help me figure this out?

767
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.490
I know that it has to be welded.
This part is supposed to twist.

768
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:53.890
1... 2... 3...

769
00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:57.100
4, 5, 6...

770
00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:58.770
What are you doing?

771
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:07.780
38, 39, 40.

772
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.120
All right. All right, Dad,
come over here and grab this.

773
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.950
Grab it right in the middle.

774
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.540
Okay. There.

775
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.250
And go up, Jackie go down. You see it?

776
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.420
Not yet.

777
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.550
All right. Here.

778
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:26.800
-How about now?
-No.

779
00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.840
Well you're going to.

780
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:31.220
I don't see it yet, I mean...

781
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.640
-You ready?
-Yeah.

782
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.320
300 feet of continuous cotton loops.

783
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.320
That's what I drew.

784
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:54.490
This is why I would like to ask you
for your investment, Trudy.

785
00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.460
Morris worked 50 years
to earn his fortune, Joy.

786
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.880
Before he passed on to the next world,
he made me promise on his deathbed...

787
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:09.050
that I would never be neglectful
with one dollar of the money...

788
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.300
that he so carefully earned.

789
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:17.310
Therefore you have to answer Morris's
four questions of financial worthiness.

790
00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.600
Are you ready?

791
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.100
I think so. Yes.

792
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:24.310
Question number one:

793
00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.230
Where did you go to high school?

794
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.990
Plainfield Public High.

795
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:33.370
Question number two:
Who were you in high school?

796
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.580
I was valedictorian.

797
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.080
The smartest student in the school.

798
00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:40.540
That's good, right?

799
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.620
Perhaps.

800
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:48.920
Joy might be a brilliant,
unrealized creator of commerce.

801
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.470
But on the other hand...

802
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:54.390
it's equally possible that she is
a fatally flawed underachiever...

803
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:59.680
doomed to a lifetime of failure,
disappointment, unfulfilled expectations.

804
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:02.350
You must admit, Joy...

805
00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.560
that your life, to date,
makes a stronger case for...

806
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:07.900
...disappointment.

807
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:11.530
I don't care about any of this.

808
00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:14.450
It's not only risky,
but it's fiscally irresponsible...

809
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.950
and doesn't make any sense, whatsoever.

810
00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.450
Joy's never run a business in her life.

811
00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.950
I've been running my father's garage
for the last 10 years.

812
00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.250
Our father.

813
00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.790
I have ventures that I'm planning
to launch here...

814
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.920
at this existing business.

815
00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:31.420
You never mentioned any of this...

816
00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.760
until I came to Trudy
to ask for an investment.

817
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:36.890
What's Morris's third question?

818
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.430
Are you prepared...

819
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.980
within six months of commencing
this venture...

820
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.140
to show adequate returns?

821
00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.610
I accept your terms.

822
00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:48.110
Don't do it, Joy.

823
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.110
What's the fourth question?

824
00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:54.700
You are in a room,
and there is a gun on the table.

825
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:59.450
And the only other person in the room
is an adversary in commerce.

826
00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.870
Only one of you can prevail.

827
00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:07.790
Yet, you have protected your business
and Morris's money.

828
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.960
Do you pick up the gun, Joy?

829
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:15.720
That's a very strange question.

830
00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.720
There is nothing strange
about this question at all.

831
00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.810
This is money.

832
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:26.810
Do you pick up the gun?

833
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:29.230
I pick up the gun.

834
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.520
Good.

835
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.900
I'm going to remember that you said that...

836
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.360
when I speak to my lawyer.

837
00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:40.660
What did Trudy's lawyer say?

838
00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.790
He did a worldwide patent search.

839
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:44.370
What's a patent?

840
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.750
A patent is like a law
that you get to protect your idea.

841
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.250
A lot of people patent their ideas...

842
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.090
but only a few of them
actually get their ideas made.

843
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.840
So Trudy just wanted to be careful...

844
00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:58.260
Joy...

845
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:02.260
I just wanted to let you know that
Touissant has almost finished his work.

846
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:03.770
And, um...

847
00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.520
You know, we really need to find
some more work for him.

848
00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:09.850
-You want more work in the house?
-Yeah.

849
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.820
I have another big job I have to go to.

850
00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.190
-What?
-Yes.

851
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.490
-Well, but we have real issues here.
-Sorry.

852
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:18.950
-We don't have money for that work, Mom.
-Well...

853
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:20.700
Okay.

854
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:23.450
Joy...

855
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:25.250
What is happening to you, Mother?

856
00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:27.120
I don't know what's going on.

857
00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:28.870
Are you in love with Touissant?

858
00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.380
I was feeling alone.

859
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.920
And I didn't even realize it,
you know?

860
00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:38.260
And then...

861
00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.890
What did the patent search find?

862
00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.230
Trudy just wanted to be careful.

863
00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:52.110
And this guy found a man that's in Texas...

864
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:54.900
who worked for another guy
in another country...

865
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:59.900
where they have an idea
that might be similar to my mop.

866
00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.320
What country?

867
00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.620
Hong Kong.

868
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:06.580
The Hong Kong man
has a representative in Dallas, Texas.

869
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:10.420
The Dallas man was very reasonable
with my lawyer.

870
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:12.750
Hey.

871
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.380
So, this guy in Texas...

872
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.970
We're supposed to pay him a royalty
on the patent as a protection, right?

873
00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.020
Right.

874
00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.640
To be safe from any claims.

875
00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:29.810
Is that correct?

876
00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.940
Please stop using the word "we."

877
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.440
None of this is your money
or your business.

878
00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:38.360
But the same guy
also owns a manufacturing plant...

879
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.450
that you guys say that it's cheaper
than any other place?

880
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.200
-Yes. In California.
-Yes.

881
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:45.780
A metal and plastic injection mold factory.

882
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:46.950
Okay, so it's the same guy.

883
00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.750
-He owns the patent...
-This happens all the time in business.

884
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:51.160
You find the best partner. It's smart.

885
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:53.580
He doesn't understand business.
He doesn't know business.

886
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:56.040
-No, no, I'm the first to say that.
-I understand business.

887
00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:59.460
Dad and I, we buy parts for the trucks
all the time at the garage.

888
00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.300
Morris did it all the time.

889
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:03.760
One-stop shopping. It's the cheapest.

890
00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:05.220
-But is that normal?
-That's how he made his money.

891
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:06.430
-Yeah, that's normal.
-Yes!

892
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.220
But is it normal, the same guy
who has the patent...

893
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:09.970
is the same guy who has the manufacturing?

894
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.350
-Yeah. Make it best.
-Yeah.

895
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.310
-Yeah?
-Better if it's that way.

896
00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.480
Okay, and the lawyer?
Right? Morris's lawyer?

897
00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:17.230
-He's good. Let's not make trouble.
-He's very good.

898
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:21.650
But he specialized in garment business, no?
Not manufacturing business.

899
00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.410
Tony. Let's quit while we're ahead.

900
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:31.830
I know that you want Tony
to be your counselor, if you will...

901
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.920
and I will respect that...

902
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.420
as Tony and you should respect
what we're proposing...

903
00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:41.920
as the lawyer
for this whole business endeavor.

904
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.600
All right. The parts have arrived
from California...

905
00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.020
and we can start manufacturing here.

906
00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.850
I have the first assembled mop.

907
00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.860
I told you it was gonna be more refined.

908
00:45:58.650 --> 00:45:59.860
And it is.

909
00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.320
Father Martinez is here.

910
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.610
You need to set those women up right now
and get going.

911
00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:06.820
They're gonna be so grateful
for the jobs, Joy.

912
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:08.490
Okay. All right.
I'll go talk to those ladies.

913
00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.910
Now I finally have jobs for them.

914
00:46:13.734 --> 00:46:16.934
- Hi, thanks for coming, Father.
- Hi, Joy.

915
00:46:18.458 --> 00:46:21.458
There are many people in our
church that need work.

916
00:46:21.482 --> 00:46:23.482
- And my cousins.
- How are they?

917
00:46:23.506 --> 00:46:26.406
I have work for you people.

918
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:29.730
and it consists of sewing

919
00:46:31.254 --> 00:46:34.454
these cotton heads.

920
00:46:34.678 --> 00:46:37.478
Like so... Look.

921
00:46:38.702 --> 00:46:40.702
Very easy.

922
00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.900
And I'll show you guys how to assemble...

923
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.970
I'm a little proud of you.
I gotta admit it.

924
00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:16.480
But, it costs much more than $15,000
to make the first run.

925
00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:17.730
I know, Trudy.

926
00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:19.980
But with all due respect,
that actually wasn't my fault.

927
00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.400
Look at this. More bills.

928
00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:26.860
-What?
-Another bill from Gerhardt.

929
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.610
This guy keeps billing me
for his mistakes.

930
00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.740
-That's business.
-No.

931
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:33.580
That's not the way I do business.

932
00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:35.250
I'm calling this guy.

933
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:42.590
Gerhardt, I'm not gonna
keep paying for these parts...

934
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:44.250
that it's taking you four times to get right.

935
00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.300
That was your design.
You have to pay for those parts.

936
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:50.220
That's mold-making.
That's the process.

937
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.640
My clients pay when we figure it out.

938
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:54.350
It was not my design, Gerhardt.

939
00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.930
It was your mistake. I'm not paying it.

940
00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.480
That was your design.
You have to pay.

941
00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:01.480
Did you just hang up on him?

942
00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:04.980
This guy was supposed to be easy
and inexpensive.

943
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.780
He keeps overbilling us.
I'm not paying for it.

944
00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.610
Nobody pay it.

945
00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.830
I'm gonna fight it out with this guy.

946
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:16.870
Just assemble them and try to sell them.

947
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.500
Just put it in your window.
Let your customers decide.

948
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:21.080
My family's been going to you
my whole life.

949
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:24.170
Look, the big companies,
they pay me for my shelf space.

950
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.130
Maybe you can sell one of your mops
to those big companies.

951
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.920
And maybe they'll put it on my shelf.

952
00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:35.470
lt's expensive, at $19.95,
but it's the only mop you'll ever have to buy.

953
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.770
But I don't want people
to buy one mop for $20...

954
00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.560
and never have to buy another mop again.

955
00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:46.690
I'd rather they keep buying our mops at $5,
50 times, 100 times.

956
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:51.990
Look, you were broke and bored.
You had an idea.

957
00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.320
So what? Lots of people have ideas.

958
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.450
Go home.
Please, take care of your family.

959
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.370
Hi. Would you like to try a new mop?

960
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:03.710
It's the only mop
you'll ever have to buy.

961
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:06.880
-Hi. Would you like to try a new mop?
-No.

962
00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.340
It's self-wringing.

963
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:10.800
You can remove the mop head,
throw it in the washing machine.

964
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:12.010
-No germs.
-No.

965
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:13.220
No.

966
00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:15.220
-No?
-Look at that.

967
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:17.310
You want to just try it?
You could just try.

968
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:20.600
It can self-wring. See?
No other mop does this.

969
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:44.250
Come and try the brand-new mop!

970
00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.340
-It's the mop of the future.
-No, thanks.

971
00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.590
Want to try this mop, ladies?

972
00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.920
-What's this?
-Hey, miss.

973
00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:52.420
It's a brand-new mop.

974
00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:55.430
You could wring it
without getting your hands dirty.

975
00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:56.590
I don't think so.

976
00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.680
Come on. Try it.
It's the mop of the future.

977
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:02.480
Self-wringing, huh?

978
00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:03.560
Yeah.

979
00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.940
All right. I do like the idea of that.

980
00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:09.940
I hate having to touch the mop head
after I get done cleaning the bathroom floor.

981
00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:11.360
I always think that's disgusting,
you know?

982
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:12.570
It's so gross.

983
00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.610
Wow. It really does get all the corners
that my sponge mop won't get.

984
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:20.080
All those crannies
where my kids spill theirjuice.

985
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:23.040
I really like it. Can we buy it?

986
00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:24.620
Take it easy, Cristy.

987
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.960
Wow. I mean, that's just amazing.
You really don't have to touch it.

988
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.210
Look at that.

989
00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:30.500
You know what would make this perfect...

990
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:32.960
if you could remove the mop head,
put it in the washing machine...

991
00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:34.800
-Really get it clean.
-That'd be great.

992
00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:36.630
-You can.
-What?

993
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.800
Are you serious?

994
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:40.140
-Well how much is this mop?
-It's $19.95.

995
00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:41.310
No, that's too much.

996
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:44.140
But I guess, I mean, if it is the only mop
that you ever have to buy...

997
00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:45.310
I mean we keep buying those
$5 mops.

998
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.640
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, sweetie.

999
00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:51.770
You, you remember Angela?
And her two brothers, right?

1000
00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:53.610
I do. Hello.

1001
00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.490
-Mommy, the policeman.
-Ma'am?

1002
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:56.780
Did we break the law?

1003
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:59.160
-I'm taking this merchandise.
-No, no. We're leaving. We're leaving.

1004
00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.910
-Now, I'm gonna let you off with a warning.
-We were just leaving.

1005
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.370
No. Sir...

1006
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.250
If the customers can just see
what the mop can do...

1007
00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:06.040
But if I catch you out here again,
you will be prosecuted!

1008
00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:07.290
Well, where do I go?
Sir, please!

1009
00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.500
-You cannot sell on Kmart property!
-I made those mops myself.

1010
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:11.340
-I paid for them. Please.
-It took a lot of work.

1011
00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.460
I won't come back,
but you don't have to take my stuff!

1012
00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:14.760
Please!

1013
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.920
-Are you even allowed to do this?
-How embarrassing for you...

1014
00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:18.590
to be seen here like this
with your daughter.

1015
00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.720
-What kind of parent are you, huh?
-Yeah, Tony.

1016
00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:21.890
-Enough.
-Hey.

1017
00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:23.010
Hey, hey, guys. Guys...

1018
00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:24.100
-All right.
-Come on.

1019
00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:25.520
-Let's go.
-Tony, let's go.

1020
00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.230
Yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming.

1021
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.070
Cristy, honey, it's okay.
Your mommy's okay.

1022
00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.790
This stupid thing.
This place is falling apart!

1023
00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.630
No... No.

1024
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:53.540
Honey, the telephone isn't working.

1025
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:55.000
I know. I just got the notice.

1026
00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:58.380
I had to go next door to use the phone.
Tommy's got a fever.

1027
00:51:58.550 --> 00:51:59.550
Tommy has a fever?

1028
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.510
Simple cold with a cough.
It's going around. All the kids have it.

1029
00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.060
Thank God the heat's still working.

1030
00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.390
Mommy, why isn't the phone working?

1031
00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.230
Because I'm late on paying the bill.

1032
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:10.850
-Are we gonna lose our house?
-Not you too.

1033
00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.610
No, we're not gonna lose our house.

1034
00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:15.150
Come on. Get upstairs. Get in the bath.

1035
00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.650
Listen to your mom and get
right in that tub.

1036
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.490
-I don't want a hot bath.
-I don't care.

1037
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:20.700
Cristy, you get in that hot bath.
Listen to your mother.

1038
00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.740
I don't want you getting sick too.

1039
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:27.120
Lauren Wells said you're a cleaning lady
and sell used mops.

1040
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:30.500
Lauren Wells said that?

1041
00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.250
Yeah. And it really hurt my feelings.

1042
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.170
First of all, even if I was
a cleaning lady, so what?

1043
00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.130
There's no shame in hard work.

1044
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:43.340
And second of all, you know, I'm...

1045
00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:48.600
I'm trying to sell a new mop,
not used mops.

1046
00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:54.400
And third of all,
don't take any guff from anybody.

1047
00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:58.110
You know, don't let it in.

1048
00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.900
I know it's hard.
And I'm sorry that happened.

1049
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:04.820
Now get in the bath.

1050
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:14.500
Come on. Go to sleep, honey.

1051
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:30.100
Joy?

1052
00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:31.730
Not now, Mimi.

1053
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:34.810
Joy, wait, wait.
Just tell me what happened today.

1054
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:37.360
I want to know how it went.
Please, I want to know.

1055
00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:41.030
It was a disaster.

1056
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:43.030
But you must never give up.

1057
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.780
Ever since you were little,
you were born to bear...

1058
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:47.160
Born to bear what, Mimi?

1059
00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.490
Failure? Disgrace?

1060
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:54.000
Humiliation in front of my daughter?

1061
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:58.750
You were born to be
the unanxious presence in the room.

1062
00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:01.800
And I know that I'm gonna live
to see you grow...

1063
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:05.220
to be the successful matriarch
that you were born to be.

1064
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:06.390
Matriarch...

1065
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.930
To be a mother with courage.

1066
00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.970
Who can't even support her children.

1067
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:12.480
Sweetheart.

1068
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.270
What are you doing here?

1069
00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.070
I have this idea.

1070
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.820
-A guy I know.
-What guy?

1071
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:26.990
He used to work with me.
And now he works at this big retailer.

1072
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.370
A new way of doing business.

1073
00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:31.330
I mean, it's worth a try.

1074
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.620
You would do that for me?

1075
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:35.870
Of course.

1076
00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.540
They were the best divorced couple
in America.

1077
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.210
Much better friends than they were
husband and wife.

1078
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:44.670
I can get you a meeting with him.

1079
00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:48.470
Where is it?

1080
00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.180
But I don't understand
what we're doing in Amish country.

1081
00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:56.890
They don't even have electricity out here.
How could they sell anything on TV?

1082
00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.310
It has nothing to do with Amish people.

1083
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.900
It just happens to be located here.
I looked it up.

1084
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:03.690
In Amish country.

1085
00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:04.780
Amish.

1086
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:05.780
What?

1087
00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:07.860
-Amish.
-Amish.

1088
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:21.090
Sign in, please.

1089
00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.590
We're here to see Marv Brickman.

1090
00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:27.380
Okay.

1091
00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:31.100
Marv Brickman, does he know who you are
if I call his office?

1092
00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:32.760
Of course he knows.

1093
00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:34.680
We're friends. We used to work together.

1094
00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.100
QVC, please hold.

1095
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.910
But Tom was wrong about that.
He was wrong about the numbers...

1096
00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.160
Tony.

1097
00:55:57.330 --> 00:55:58.500
Marv. How are you?

1098
00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:00.000
I can't see you today.

1099
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:01.460
Why?

1100
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:03.500
Maybe tomorrow if you can stay in town.

1101
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:05.960
No, we left the kids at home.
We can't.

1102
00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:07.920
We can't stay until tomorrow.

1103
00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:11.050
Listen, you can't just expect
to come in here and see someone.

1104
00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:12.510
Hey, did you take care
of that advertising thing?

1105
00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.760
-Yes, I did.
-Good. All right.

1106
00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:15.930
What's going on here?

1107
00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.810
-This is my good friend, Tony.
-Tony Miranda.

1108
00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:19.310
We worked together at Campbell's.

1109
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:20.390
Neil Walker.

1110
00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.020
-And this is his ex-wife.
-Good to meet you.

1111
00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:23.520
-Joy.
-Hi. Neil.

1112
00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:24.730
She's an inventor.

1113
00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.900
She wanted two minutes of your time today,
but, Neil, don't worry about this.

1114
00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:29.360
-Maybe tomorrow.
-You know what?

1115
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:32.160
Why don't you come in for five minutes
while the sales group's still here.

1116
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.740
-Okay. Hold my bag.
-Neil, are you sure?

1117
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:35.120
-Yeah.
-Yeah, absolutely.

1118
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:36.540
Thank you.

1119
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.750
-Got everything?
-Yeah.

1120
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:39.330
Great. Thank you, man.

1121
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:41.500
Thank you.

1122
00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:51.260
So tell us your name, please.

1123
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:56.180
I'm Joy.

1124
00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:00.180
And what would you like
to show us today?

1125
00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:02.650
I have a self-wringing mop.

1126
00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:05.020
Just...

1127
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:06.070
Do you need some help?

1128
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:07.320
No. No, no.

1129
00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:08.860
All right.

1130
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:11.700
That's my shoe.

1131
00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.700
Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry, sir.

1132
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:17.370
Sock's wet.

1133
00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.700
Do you mind?

1134
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:20.960
Sorry.

1135
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.040
Is that plastic?

1136
00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:27.130
Yes.

1137
00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:29.000
Arnold, why don't you give it a try?
Is that okay?

1138
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:30.260
Yes, of course.

1139
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.050
Just dunk it.

1140
00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:33.720
-I dip it?
-Yes.

1141
00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.550
And then I... twist it?

1142
00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.060
But you pull...
You have to pull it first.

1143
00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:39.470
-Pull it and twist it.
-You got to pull it first before you twist it.

1144
00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.770
-I'm pulling it and...
-Pull and twist.

1145
00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:41.930
and I am twisting it.

1146
00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:44.350
Pull and twist,
just like when you're on the road.

1147
00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:50.190
We don't mean to be disrespectful, Joy.
It's the end of a long day for us.

1148
00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:54.820
I feel like I want to tell you
a little bit about who I am.

1149
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:58.280
Because I have a feeling you don't know
exactly where you are right now.

1150
00:57:58.410 --> 00:57:59.410
Am I right?

1151
00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.410
Ten months ago...

1152
00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:06.080
a man named Barry Diller
called me from Los Angeles.

1153
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.920
He started a television network.
Fox television channel.

1154
00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:15.720
And prior to that, he ran 20th Century Fox,
among other studios.

1155
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:18.970
And he acquired a little cable channel...

1156
00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:21.600
right here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

1157
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:23.730
And he hired me to run it...

1158
00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:26.520
as a bigger idea.

1159
00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:30.690
Now, I'm from Detroit, Michigan.

1160
00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:36.570
I ran America's largest, most affordable...

1161
00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.580
successful, value-driven retailer.

1162
00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:41.490
Chain called Kmart.

1163
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:45.000
Prior to that, I was a buyer for Kmart.

1164
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:50.130
And prior to that,
I managed seven separate Kmart stores.

1165
00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:53.800
I decide what products
we let into our stores here...

1166
00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:59.010
into people's homes, 24 hours a day,
for our valued customers.

1167
00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:04.180
I choose very carefully
and very conservatively.

1168
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:09.360
I spend most of my day deflecting
incoming shots from people like yourself.

1169
00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:13.110
You see that chart?

1170
00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:23.830
This green line either rises
or stays the same each month.

1171
00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:27.500
There's no problem
with my product choice.

1172
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.590
Do you know what QVC stands for, Joy?

1173
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:34.670
No, I don't.

1174
00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:38.760
Quality, Value, Convenience.

1175
00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:43.720
I sell product affordably,
but I don't sell cheap product.

1176
00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:46.390
And your mop is plastic
and it looks strange.

1177
00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:51.230
I don't know anything about charts.

1178
00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.400
Or...

1179
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:55.860
...business, frankly.

1180
00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:58.700
But I do clean my own home.

1181
00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.700
And I made this mop...

1182
01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:05.040
because it is better
than anything else out there.

1183
01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:09.870
Please give me a chance.

1184
01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:13.540
I like that it's plastic...

1185
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.630
because it's so light in my hands,
it's like nothing.

1186
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:20.550
It's also ten times more absorbent
than any other mop on the market.

1187
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.680
Why?

1188
01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:27.390
Because of 300 feet of continuous
cotton loop that I looped myself.

1189
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.270
That is an enormous amount of absorbent cotton...

1190
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.150
on a very small mop head.

1191
01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:35.770
Now I'm done with the bathroom,
and I haven't wrung the mop once.

1192
01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.570
Let me ask you a question.

1193
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.740
Would you take this mop...

1194
01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.240
where you were
just cleaning the bathroom...

1195
01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:43.280
and around the toilet,
and all of those germs...

1196
01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.830
and take it into the kitchen...

1197
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:48.450
where your family eats,
where you feed your children?

1198
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:52.670
I take this mop head,
I put it in the washing machine...

1199
01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:54.460
it comes out clean like new.

1200
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.960
You can't do that with any other mop.

1201
01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.920
-So...
-Stop.

1202
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:08.270
Can you make 50,000
of these mops by next week?

1203
01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.100
Yeah, I think so.

1204
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:16.690
David Selznick, the son of immigrants...

1205
01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.940
married Jennifer Jones from Oklahoma,
America's sweetheart.

1206
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:22.320
That just goes to show you
that in America...

1207
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:26.200
the ordinary meets the extraordinary
every single day.

1208
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:28.540
Thomas. Where are you going with that?

1209
01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.290
The skinny pants you wanted.

1210
01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:33.000
I never said "skinny pants."
I said, "stovepipe." Classic look.

1211
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:34.500
I heard "skinny pants"

1212
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:36.840
You know how much I love the stovepipe.

1213
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.800
-Stovepipe. Classic. Got it.
-Got it.

1214
01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.630
-Fine, we'll go for stovepipe.
-Thank you.

1215
01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:46.100
See those guys? I told them so many times
and they still don't understand.

1216
01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:48.010
A very smart guy once said...

1217
01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.480
"You tell somebody something once, they don't listen.
You tell somebody four times, they don't listen.

1218
01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.650
"By the ninth time you say it,
they begin to hear you."

1219
01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:56.560
That's why we're on 24 hours a day.

1220
01:01:56.730 --> 01:01:59.190
That's why, with the people who I have
to tell about the stovepipe.

1221
01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:02.070
Music in the makeup rooms?

1222
01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.610
Yeah, I thought it'd
give a sense of place, Todd.

1223
01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.990
But if you don't want it,
you can always turn it down.

1224
01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.200
You're our biggest seller, Todd.

1225
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:09.370
Whatever you need to make you comfortable.
You're who we care about.

1226
01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:10.580
You're our number-one seller.

1227
01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.870
-What?
-Oh, no.

1228
01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:14.580
He's your number-one seller?

1229
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:17.960
No, no, no. Cindy, please.
You know that we love you.

1230
01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.050
Oh, for heaven sake.

1231
01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:24.430
She's never had a professional attitude.
Clearly, she's jealous.

1232
01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.590
But could you do me a favor?
Make her your friend.

1233
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.010
Could you just do me that favor, Todd?
Please?

1234
01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.180
For me?

1235
01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.230
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

1236
01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:36.480
This is Joy. She has a very exciting new mop
that we're gonna introduce next week.

1237
01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:38.810
I would like you to launch it.
You're my first choice.

1238
01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:40.230
A mop?

1239
01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.900
You want me to bring this newborn
into the world?

1240
01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:50.240
That newborn that you're holding is
every cent, every dollar, even debt...

1241
01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:51.450
that I've ever made.

1242
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.330
Every cent you've ever made?

1243
01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:54.660
That's right.

1244
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.790
That kind of pressure is not helpful.

1245
01:02:57.250 --> 01:02:58.630
-What?
-No

1246
01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:01.000
It's not part of my process, either.

1247
01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:02.590
Oh.

1248
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.260
-Todd...
-I didn't mean to pressure you, Todd.

1249
01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.640
-Performers can be finicky creatures.
-He's very sensitive.

1250
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.060
He is our number-one seller.
He is selling everything through the roof...

1251
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:16.390
in numbers we've never seen before.

1252
01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:17.940
I take it very seriously.

1253
01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:20.190
I see it as a privilege that we have
to go into people's homes.

1254
01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.980
And I despise anybody
who's cynical about that.

1255
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:25.530
Jack Warner wasn't cynical about that.
Darryl Zanuck wasn't cynical about that.

1256
01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.400
And Neil Walker is not cynical about that.

1257
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.410
Let me show you the stage.

1258
01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.620
I believe eventually, one day...

1259
01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:37.620
television will even be
by and about actual regular people.

1260
01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:41.000
Maybe even on computers,
24 hours a day.

1261
01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.750
Who knows?
Nobody thought this network would be real.

1262
01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.170
And here we are.

1263
01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:48.760
-By the way, stock's going through the roof.
-What...?

1264
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:52.930
Must be mindful of Joan's dog.

1265
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:56.270
Who's... Who's Joan?

1266
01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:59.310
Thank you, darling.

1267
01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.110
You're never gonna make it
in a man's world dressed like that.

1268
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:05.650
Mr. Peepers, you were almost
a Peepers pancake.

1269
01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:09.530
It's a round stage that has four
or five different sets that rotate...

1270
01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.370
depending on what we're selling
at a given moment.

1271
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:13.830
The clasp is part of the necklace. See?

1272
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:16.790
Look at the quality in this clasp.
That's what we do.

1273
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.960
Absolutely exquisite.

1274
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.330
Here comes Joan and Cindy.
Watch this.

1275
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:23.210
These guys are major.

1276
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:24.880
Joan's the original seller.

1277
01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:28.300
If you're just starting yourjewelry wardrobe,
can you do anything better than this?

1278
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:30.880
You're gonna mix in your blacks,
your golds, your pearls.

1279
01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:32.050
-Everything.
-Everything.

1280
01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:33.390
Look at it against the peach. Okay?

1281
01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.060
-Look at that.
-Morning.

1282
01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:36.680
-Look at that.
-Green. Afternoon.

1283
01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:38.310
-Look. Black, night.
-Black, evening.

1284
01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.690
-Of course at night.
-I mean, can you be more elegant?

1285
01:04:40.850 --> 01:04:43.020
So it's functional. Elegant.

1286
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:45.730
You can wear it alone.
You can wear it... What I love....

1287
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.990
See. Stars and people,
they always make the mistake.

1288
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.030
They think it's about the face,
but it's not.

1289
01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.660
It's about the hands.

1290
01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:53.070
Because that's what people use.

1291
01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.910
They hold things they care about.

1292
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.410
And her hands are gonna become
their hands.

1293
01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.830
And that becomes them.

1294
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.330
And then their voice,
and then their eyes.

1295
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.000
Stars always make the mistake.

1296
01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:06.500
It's really about the hands and the voice.
That's the heart of it.

1297
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:09.590
Number J-6276.

1298
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:11.220
A $100 value.

1299
01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.760
Are they not phenomenal?

1300
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.180
-Now watch this.
-These can be yours.

1301
01:05:15.350 --> 01:05:17.850
-Cindy's gonna lay this down right...
-But you need to call in right now.

1302
01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:19.060
$39.99.

1303
01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:20.770
...now!

1304
01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.940
You need this. You can get this.

1305
01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.690
You need to call right now, though.

1306
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:27.520
-I'm being told we have limited quantity left.
-Watch the calls come in.

1307
01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.360
Watch them. Here they come.

1308
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:31.900
For $39.99,
you might as well get several.

1309
01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:34.240
Calls coming in now.

1310
01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:36.070
Calls. Calls.

1311
01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.410
Calls. Calls. Calls. Calls.

1312
01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:41.620
Look at the count.
I guarantee we're gonna go over twenty.

1313
01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:43.460
Those are FTC standards.
Those are legal.

1314
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:45.960
Those are coming in. Keep your eyes...
Those are actual sales, Joy.

1315
01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:47.380
Lines are busy?

1316
01:05:47.550 --> 01:05:49.050
-Is the queue full?
-Queue's full.

1317
01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.260
Okay. We need a phone call right now.

1318
01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:53.430
When they can't call through,
we gotta keep them watching.

1319
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:55.090
Did we get a call? Did we get a call?

1320
01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:56.300
Okay. Got it.

1321
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:57.760
Keep this going. Phone call right now.

1322
01:05:57.930 --> 01:05:59.810
Wait, wait, wait!
We have a caller! We have a caller!

1323
01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.430
Sharon from Colorado. Hi, Sharon.

1324
01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.480
Hi, Sharon.

1325
01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.900
Cindy and Joan!
I can't believe I'm talking to you!

1326
01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.320
Are you happy with your necklace?

1327
01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.900
These necklaces are so gorgeous
and timeless.

1328
01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:15.110
-My great-grandmother had things like this.
-Yes, yes. Keep it going.

1329
01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.330
I am so excited to have these.

1330
01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:21.750
Keep it going. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1331
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:23.830
Get one for your mother.
Get one for your sister.

1332
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.330
Watch the counter, Joy. Joy.

1333
01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.960
-You will not regret owning this.
-No, you will not.

1334
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:29.290
See those numbers?

1335
01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.170
We're gonna wind up at 25,000.

1336
01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:33.920
Cindy knows how to close it.

1337
01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.180
Wow.

1338
01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:38.100
Okay, I want you to go home,
I want you to call your lawyer.

1339
01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.510
Look at your contract.

1340
01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.140
Make sure your product factory
is in line.

1341
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:45.190
-Okay?
-Okay.

1342
01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:48.270
Okay, Godspeed, good luck.
Here we go. I'll walk you out.

1343
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:56.030
You can't expect Trudy to write a check
for $200,000 for 50,000 mops...

1344
01:06:56.490 --> 01:07:00.370
when you already owe her $18,000
to make mops you haven't even sold yet.

1345
01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:07.960
Do you understand that there is a business
that wants to sell my mop on television?

1346
01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:09.790
It's going to sell.

1347
01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:14.010
Fine. You feel so strongly about it,
you put up half the money.

1348
01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:17.630
Yes. It's only fair that you share
the financial risk, too.

1349
01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.260
How's she gonna do that?
She's got nothing. She's got no money.

1350
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:25.930
What, do you want me to take out
a second mortgage on my house?

1351
01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.320
They want me to take out
a second mortgage on my house.

1352
01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.940
A second mortgage?

1353
01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:36.450
But the house, the kids, Joy.

1354
01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:38.660
What's gonna happen, Joy?
How would you do that?

1355
01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.740
I don't know.

1356
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:56.210
-Hey. How you doing?
-Hey.

1357
01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:58.840
You know I've been watching you
through that fence since you were a little girl?

1358
01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:00.340
-Yeah.
-I've been watching you grow up.

1359
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:01.680
-Hey, listen.
-What?

1360
01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:03.810
You think it would be okay if I...

1361
01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:05.680
-You wanna fire a few rounds?
-I do.

1362
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:06.850
Yeah. Might make you feel better.

1363
01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.020
Thank you. I think it will.

1364
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:09.690
-You know how to hold it?
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1365
01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:11.980
Okay. Sure.

1366
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:15.530
Good.

1367
01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:17.190
Good.

1368
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:19.070
Good.

1369
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:20.950
Good.

1370
01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:39.840
This is it! Oh, my gosh.

1371
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:43.680
Get ready. This is definitely
gonna change the holidays...

1372
01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:46.720
for anyone who has a floor
or a bathroom...

1373
01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:49.890
because we have the most exciting
new home product in years.

1374
01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:51.190
Yeah!

1375
01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:54.610
This is the new self-wringing mop.

1376
01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:55.770
Okay, okay, okay!

1377
01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:58.690
lt's the new standard in homes,
right here.

1378
01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:01.860
Let's take a look at this.
This is brought to you only by QVC.

1379
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:07.580
Now, this is clearly extremely
soft and absorbent cotton.

1380
01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:09.580
There we go.

1381
01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:13.040
You just take this, and you...

1382
01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:14.750
start...

1383
01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:18.550
I'm not sure.
This is a little trickier than it looks.

1384
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:19.630
Put it...

1385
01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.430
Well, it's getting my arm wet, here.

1386
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:25.260
Let's see. We got no sales here.

1387
01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:26.930
What happened?

1388
01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:28.310
Is there a call?

1389
01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.140
So there... So there are no calls.

1390
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:34.770
All right.

1391
01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:41.530
And we do not have any sales still
so here's what we're gonna do.

1392
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:44.240
We're gonna move on.
Now, we're gonna move on.

1393
01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:48.700
Cindy is gonna talk to Sarina Kimball,
former star from Falcon Crest and Dynasty...

1394
01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:54.080
and she is gonna tell us
all about her new line of gowns.

1395
01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:58.500
These are my special occasion gowns...

1396
01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.840
"Special." How apropos.

1397
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:07.510
...that were inspired by all of the times
that I was in Dynasty and Falcon Crest.

1398
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.930
That is absolutely amazing.

1399
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.270
I want you to pan in. Look at these.

1400
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.310
-Look at the detail.
-Look at the detail.

1401
01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.150
Look at the value in that.

1402
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:18.320
About how many sequins
would you say that is?

1403
01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.480
That's it?

1404
01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:20.650
-That's all?
-No, it's over.

1405
01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.030
That's how fast it happens.

1406
01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:23.360
No, they're gonna give her
a second chance.

1407
01:10:23.530 --> 01:10:25.200
No, they're not gonna give her
a second chance.

1408
01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.320
That's not what's gonna happen.

1409
01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:29.660
They're going to give her
a second chance.

1410
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:31.660
-Why do you have to be so negative?
-They will.

1411
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:33.660
$200,000!

1412
01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.330
50,000 mops.

1413
01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.250
Now, this is easily one of my favorites.

1414
01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:41.920
She's wearing the black and gold...

1415
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:10.120
Joy.

1416
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:16.960
Hello?

1417
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:21.960
5,107 sequins for...

1418
01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.170
Get this. How much?

1419
01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:25.340
$299.

1420
01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:31.220
I'm sorry the product didn't sell.

1421
01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:37.310
That man didn't know
what he was doing, Neil.

1422
01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:42.230
Well, it wasn't the man, Joy.
It was the product.

1423
01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.740
I made 50,000 units
because you told me to.

1424
01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.410
I mortgaged my house,
I'm in $200,000 of debt. More.

1425
01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.670
Well, it's your business.
It's your debt.

1426
01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.920
And we indemnify up to a third,
if you read your contract.

1427
01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.420
To be honest,
that's even gonna be hard to get.

1428
01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.680
Neil, you gotta give us another chance.

1429
01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.760
I'm so sorry, Joy.

1430
01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:16.730
I just can't bring it to my boss.
I can't.

1431
01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.600
I can't accept your answer.

1432
01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:26.110
I can't, and I won't.

1433
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:31.450
Joy, you have to let Trudy
report this loss in bankruptcy...

1434
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.410
because otherwise she's gonna
hemorrhage even more money.

1435
01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:36.290
You have to file, too...

1436
01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:39.120
because you mortgaged your children's future
and you lost...

1437
01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:41.790
and you have to
prepare yourself for that.

1438
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:43.630
You have to file for bankruptcy.

1439
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:45.750
I warned you so many times, Joy!

1440
01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.420
Dad, I warned you
to not spend her money!

1441
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:50.630
Come on! You've been plotting against her
from the very beginning, Peggy!

1442
01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.340
Now we're bankrupt, Tony!

1443
01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.220
I'm in a meeting with our lawyers.

1444
01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:58.270
What do you think you're doing?

1445
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:05.320
"Go home, Joy, and watch the numbers
roll in on television.

1446
01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:08.610
"Make 50,000 mops...

1447
01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:12.450
"borrowing and owing every dollar,
including your home."

1448
01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.620
It could have been handled better.

1449
01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:16.160
I'll let Todd have another shot.

1450
01:13:16.330 --> 01:13:19.330
I don't want Todd
or anyone else to try it.

1451
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.160
It should be me.

1452
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:22.500
We don't have regular people.

1453
01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:25.790
We have celebrities or spokesmodels
do the selling.

1454
01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.420
I told you this.

1455
01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.840
Who showed you the mop?

1456
01:13:30.010 --> 01:13:32.090
Who sold it to you?
Who taught you how to use it?

1457
01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:35.680
And who convinced you that it was great
after you thought it was worthless?

1458
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.600
Excuse me, can you give us a second?

1459
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:45.150
Come with me.

1460
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.120
You ever been in front of a TV camera?
You comfortable in front of a TV camera?

1461
01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:02.160
Because when you get there, there's lights
and there's camera, and people freeze up.

1462
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:05.710
You said to me that David Selznick,
the son of immigrants...

1463
01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:09.380
married Jennifer Jones,
an all-American girl from Oklahoma...

1464
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:13.380
because in America,
all races and all classes...

1465
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:16.720
can meet and make
whatever opportunities they can.

1466
01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:22.140
And that is what you feel when you reach
into people's homes with what you sell.

1467
01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.150
You said that.

1468
01:14:29.190 --> 01:14:31.860
What do you think? Looks great, right?

1469
01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:35.320
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

1470
01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:36.910
Very vogue, very classic.

1471
01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:39.910
All right, if you come back next time...
Lori? Lori?

1472
01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.170
I just want you to just put the hair a little bit forward,
just like that, if she comes back again.

1473
01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.710
Okay? Not with the comb,
not with the comb.

1474
01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.380
-Try the black.
-Okay.

1475
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:50.670
Okay?

1476
01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.840
It's gonna be perfect.

1477
01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.600
Wow.

1478
01:15:09.190 --> 01:15:11.610
Beautiful. What do you think?
How do you feel?

1479
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:15.740
I'd like to change just one thing.
Would you mind?

1480
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:18.280
-Okay, surprise me.
-Small thing.

1481
01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:19.370
I'll surprise you.

1482
01:15:19.450 --> 01:15:20.620
Okay, surprise me.

1483
01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:26.460
What would the small thing be
that she changes?

1484
01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:31.460
What?

1485
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.710
You undid the whole thing.

1486
01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:35.720
This is me.

1487
01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.930
This is you?

1488
01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:39.470
You've got the exact same outfit
you had when you came in here.

1489
01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.800
I wear a blouse and I wear pants.

1490
01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:43.640
That's who I am.

1491
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.770
I want to go on as me.

1492
01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.440
Gonna go on as you.

1493
01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:50.650
I hope you make it back.

1494
01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.520
Joan, Cindy. Say good luck to Joy.

1495
01:15:53.610 --> 01:15:54.690
-Wow.
-Wow.

1496
01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:55.990
You look great. Good luck today.

1497
01:15:56.150 --> 01:15:57.150
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

1498
01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.490
That's her, that's how she is.

1499
01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:00.950
Blouse and... She should be in a skirt.
She's got nice long legs.

1500
01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.200
Show her legs.

1501
01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.330
Good luck.

1502
01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:06.580
Joan Rivers wants me in a skirt,
but I'm gonna do pants.

1503
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:08.160
Do what you want to do.

1504
01:16:08.670 --> 01:16:10.080
Come on, let's go upstairs.

1505
01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:20.970
Are you nervous?

1506
01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:22.140
Yes.

1507
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:24.100
Just be yourself.

1508
01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:25.680
Just remember, it's all about the hands.

1509
01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:27.850
Here we go.

1510
01:16:43.370 --> 01:16:46.370
Ready... Stage is moving!

1511
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:51.040
Household product 375 in three, two...

1512
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:59.050
What are you doing? Come on.

1513
01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:01.550
Go! Go!

1514
01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:04.550
She's freezing.

1515
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:08.980
Sorry, these lights are so bright.

1516
01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:14.360
Nobody tells you how bright these lights...
Well, Neil did tell me.

1517
01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:19.400
Neil is my boss. Here.

1518
01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:23.410
I should thank him
for letting me be up here.

1519
01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.200
-Sorry.
-You're Joy.

1520
01:17:26.370 --> 01:17:27.370
I am Joy.

1521
01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:30.410
Just say something!
Talk about the mop!

1522
01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:31.580
Oh, my God.

1523
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:32.920
We have to do something.

1524
01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.590
We have to do something.

1525
01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:37.590
Do we have a call?

1526
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.760
-Could we go to a call?
-We have a call.

1527
01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.090
-It's a friendly call?
-It's a friendly call.

1528
01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:42.430
Okay. Take it. Take it.

1529
01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:43.930
Joy, we have a call.

1530
01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:46.220
A call? How did that happen?

1531
01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:48.600
Well, we have a call.

1532
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:50.390
Hi. Joanne from New York.

1533
01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.560
Joanne from New York.

1534
01:17:51.730 --> 01:17:54.190
We have a call coming in
from Joanne from New York.

1535
01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:58.900
Yeah, I'm calling in because I would love a mop
that I don't have to touch when I wring it.

1536
01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:02.030
You know, my hands get raw
and when I mop broken glass...

1537
01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.950
and I wring the mop, I cut my hands.

1538
01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:09.080
Do you ever cut your hands
when you're wringing?

1539
01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:11.580
Joanne, that is so funny
that you said that.

1540
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:16.130
That is actually exactly how
I was inspired to invent this mop.

1541
01:18:16.290 --> 01:18:21.380
There was glass shattered everywhere.
I was with my two kids, with my father, and I...

1542
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:24.800
Every time I would wring the mop,
I would get glass shards in my hands.

1543
01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:28.300
And the old mop
just wasn't very absorbent.

1544
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:33.560
So I went to my daughter's room,
and I borrowed her crayons...

1545
01:18:33.730 --> 01:18:36.310
and I designed this mop.

1546
01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.110
Make sure you get down there.
Yeah, that's it.

1547
01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.820
It's made of plastic, so it's lightweight,
but very durable.

1548
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:42.400
Go in. Go in to the hands.

1549
01:18:42.490 --> 01:18:43.490
It's extremely absorbent...

1550
01:18:43.570 --> 01:18:45.990
with 300 continuous cotton loops...

1551
01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.490
that I looped myself
when I designed it.

1552
01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:51.790
-How much is it?
-It is $19.95.

1553
01:18:52.330 --> 01:18:54.330
I like that price.
I want a whole bunch of them.

1554
01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.330
Thank you.

1555
01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:58.420
H375. That's the order number.

1556
01:18:58.590 --> 01:19:00.670
Household item 375.

1557
01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.840
I guarantee you...

1558
01:19:02.010 --> 01:19:03.170
That's it. Stay right there.

1559
01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:05.430
...you are not going to find
another mop like this that exists.

1560
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:08.930
If there was, I would have bought it
and I wouldn't have cut my hands up.

1561
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:13.810
You can get across the whole kitchen
with one wring. Just imagine that.

1562
01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.310
Watch this.

1563
01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.940
Chocolate syrup.

1564
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:21.270
Go the syrup. Go the syrup.

1565
01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.030
Baby food.
A very big spill at my house.

1566
01:19:24.190 --> 01:19:25.490
Very common spill for me.

1567
01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:27.200
No. Hands, hands.

1568
01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:31.620
Now, the biggest difference,
I don't have to touch this disgusting mop head.

1569
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:33.660
There's not another mop on the market...

1570
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:38.370
that has as much absorbent cotton
as this mop right here.

1571
01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:42.340
And I guarantee you,
there will be no regrets, no returns.

1572
01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:45.550
I have been mopping for most of my life,
every single day.

1573
01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:46.720
Phones are ringing!

1574
01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.010
I cannot tell you how much
this mop has changed my life.

1575
01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:51.140
-Phones are ringing! Phones are ringing!
-The phones are ringing. The phones are ringing.

1576
01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.220
Go.

1577
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:55.310
This is gonna be the greatest mop
to have around Christmas time...

1578
01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.350
when you have family over...

1579
01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:01.480
I am a mother of two.
There is just spill after spill.

1580
01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:03.320
Family comes to town.

1581
01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:05.900
You can mop your entire kitchen
with one wring!

1582
01:20:06.150 --> 01:20:08.910
Oh, my God! 29,000!

1583
01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.660
This is very special!

1584
01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:13.410
I haven't even told you about
my personal favorite feature...

1585
01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.580
which is the removable mop head...

1586
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:20.580
that I can put into the washing machine
and it will come out clean as new.

1587
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:22.130
Yes! Yes!

1588
01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:24.630
Oh, my God, these numbers keep climbing!

1589
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:26.760
Thank you. I...

1590
01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.130
Yes, that's right. Keep it going.

1591
01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:29.430
Thank you.

1592
01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.470
This is the most absorbent
mop on the market. It's lightweight.

1593
01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:36.930
It's the only mop that you're ever gonna buy,
the best mop you're ever gonna use.

1594
01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:41.400
It is lightweight and durable, and that is
just me speaking from my experience.

1595
01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:45.610
As someone who mops their house
every single day, from my heart.

1596
01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:50.110
This woman's gonna be
a whole new business.

1597
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.990
No way.

1598
01:20:58.410 --> 01:20:59.750
Oh, my God.

1599
01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:23.310
Can you believe it?
Can you believe it?

1600
01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.860
I thought for sure you were gonna tell me
that your counting machine was broken.

1601
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:28.690
I listened to you. You were right.

1602
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:31.360
I just can't believe
that actually happened.

1603
01:21:31.530 --> 01:21:32.530
I know.

1604
01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:35.120
I guess you could say
we're friends in commerce.

1605
01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.280
Friends in commerce.

1606
01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:37.410
Yeah.

1607
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:41.000
Let's promise each other that if, one day,
and that day may come...

1608
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.500
that we become adversaries in commerce,
that we remain friends.

1609
01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:46.290
Because that's a true friendship indeed.

1610
01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:47.710
Friends in commerce.

1611
01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:50.340
I agree. Let's shake on it.

1612
01:22:31.090 --> 01:22:32.920
We've got 10 looms...

1613
01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:36.640
and then when they're completed,
this is where the mop heads are sewn.

1614
01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:40.180
Who makes your parts?

1615
01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.390
A factory out in California.

1616
01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:45.230
It was cheaper and faster
than any place around here.

1617
01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.730
Smart. Are they gonna be able
to stay on schedule?

1618
01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:50.230
Yeah.

1619
01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.450
One time.

1620
01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:19.140
-Right there.
-Thank you.

1621
01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:20.350
-You're welcome.
-Right here?

1622
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:23.270
Hello?

1623
01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:25.450
Mimi.

1624
01:24:28.290 --> 01:24:29.370
Mimi.

1625
01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:47.020
I so hated to leave her that day.

1626
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:50.770
I had so much I wanted to say to her.

1627
01:24:51.690 --> 01:24:53.730
And to my great granddaughter.

1628
01:24:56.490 --> 01:25:01.570
I felt I wanted to stay near her
and watch over her.

1629
01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.310
Cristy.

1630
01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.230
There's a problem in California.

1631
01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:21.530
There can't be a problem in California.
I told Neil that everything was fine.

1632
01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:24.700
Gerhardt keeps raising his price.
He just did it again.

1633
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:25.870
More money per unit.

1634
01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.200
He can't do that.
We're gonna lose money.

1635
01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:31.500
I sent a representative to handle him.

1636
01:26:32.710 --> 01:26:34.540
Representative?
We don't have a representative.

1637
01:26:34.710 --> 01:26:36.250
What representative?

1638
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:38.000
Peggy went.

1639
01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:39.420
Peggy?

1640
01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.840
I don't want to talk about this
right now.

1641
01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:56.060
She wanted to be part of it.

1642
01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:58.230
How could you send Peggy?

1643
01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.900
She wanted to be part of it.

1644
01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:09.830
You both are blood relatives.
You're half-sisters.

1645
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:13.750
It's very, very important
that you love and respect each other.

1646
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:20.540
I paid them the 20
that you owed them. I had to.

1647
01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:25.800
I got them to fill the order
of the 100,000...

1648
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:28.470
with a price increase
of only two dollars per unit.

1649
01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:33.220
We can't increase at all, Peggy.
Don't you understand?

1650
01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:38.190
We sold at a certain price.

1651
01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:42.650
Any hikes,
especially the ones he's asking for...

1652
01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:44.690
mean that I will lose so much money...

1653
01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:49.110
that I'll be in even more debt
than I was before.

1654
01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.790
You're gonna make it back.

1655
01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:55.750
I'm gonna make it back?

1656
01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:57.580
How?

1657
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:04.840
I've got ideas, you know.

1658
01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:09.130
There are things that I'd like to do.

1659
01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:12.970
I spoke to him about a project
that Dad and I have been designing.

1660
01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:14.310
Right, Dad?

1661
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:15.930
Yes, we did.

1662
01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:22.730
Do you have any idea
how much your idea will cost?

1663
01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.980
How or where you'll sell it?

1664
01:28:25.650 --> 01:28:28.820
If you can even manufacture it
after it's taken everything we've got...

1665
01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:32.490
to sell this one product that now,
thanks to you...

1666
01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:34.660
is going to cost more money?

1667
01:28:35.290 --> 01:28:38.000
Maybe my product
is better than your product.

1668
01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:40.580
I can do what you did on TV.
It's not that hard.

1669
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:44.340
Isn't that the whole purpose of that channel?
It's that everybody could do it?

1670
01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:50.380
What your sister does is not easy...

1671
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:54.390
but what we were planning to do...

1672
01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:58.230
is not that difficult.

1673
01:28:59.230 --> 01:29:00.980
Listen to me.

1674
01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:07.400
Never speak on my behalf...

1675
01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:13.490
about my business again.

1676
01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:18.120
Now I have to go to California.

1677
01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:20.430
Can I help you?

1678
01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.600
I'm Joy. I'm here to see Gerhardt.

1679
01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:24.690
He's not available.

1680
01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.150
I'll wait.

1681
01:30:30.610 --> 01:30:32.900
She says she's here to see Gerhardt.

1682
01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:34.860
Gerhardt!

1683
01:30:42.710 --> 01:30:44.670
Hey. I'm Gerhardt.

1684
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:46.210
I'm Joy.

1685
01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:47.630
Come on in.

1686
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:49.090
Derek Markham is my boss.

1687
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:50.340
He lives in Texas.

1688
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:54.800
Fabri-Pac is one of several companies
he owns or collects royalties for.

1689
01:30:54.970 --> 01:30:58.350
I report to him.
He makes pricing decisions.

1690
01:30:58.510 --> 01:31:01.470
Well, I've never met or talked
to this Derek Markham...

1691
01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:03.310
but I've talked to you many times
on the phone.

1692
01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:04.890
And I do find it very curious...

1693
01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:08.020
that the second I'm on television,
with a lot of success...

1694
01:31:08.190 --> 01:31:10.480
the price for our products goes up.

1695
01:31:10.650 --> 01:31:13.320
Seems very unfair to me,
to say the least.

1696
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:16.280
Seems like you're shaking us down.

1697
01:31:16.450 --> 01:31:18.740
You met Gregory, our plant foreman.

1698
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:21.200
It's very hard for us to lower the cost
at this point.

1699
01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:23.870
We're already losing a lot of money.

1700
01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:27.080
How could that possibly be,
with the $500,000 that we've given you...

1701
01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:29.420
on top of the
$50,000 of advance royalties...

1702
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:32.710
that have gone to a Derek Markham
in Dallas.

1703
01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.010
And that's not even counting
what my sister paid you...

1704
01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:36.720
without my authority, by the way...

1705
01:31:36.890 --> 01:31:39.600
for your overcharges and your mistakes.

1706
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:43.930
Your sister paid the increase
that you refused to pay.

1707
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:48.100
Well, she had no authority to do that.
She's not an officer of my corporation.

1708
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:53.610
You and I could both spend a lot of time
and money in court to prove that I'm right...

1709
01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:56.400
but that would just make
our lawyers wealthy...

1710
01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:58.990
while my product dies
instead of being on television...

1711
01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.950
like it could be right now.

1712
01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.660
You can pay more.

1713
01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:06.790
I can't pay more. I won't.

1714
01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.750
Costs are higher.
Wear and tear on the molds.

1715
01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.880
We have to remake them every other week.

1716
01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:14.880
Is that so? Can I see the molds?

1717
01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:16.470
They're in the machines.

1718
01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:19.470
It'll take some time
to prepare them for you.

1719
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:26.390
Is there a bathroom I could use?

1720
01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.900
Yeah, it's down the hall.
Gregory will show you.

1721
01:32:40.110 --> 01:32:41.200
Thanks.

1722
01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:03.320
What?

1723
01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:08.700
What are you doing in here?

1724
01:34:09.330 --> 01:34:10.620
What is this?

1725
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:13.670
These are my designs,
these are my molds!

1726
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:14.830
Those are ours!

1727
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.960
And we knew you'd be trouble.
The cops are on their way.

1728
01:34:17.130 --> 01:34:19.250
-We called 'em as soon as you showed up!
-These are my molds!

1729
01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:20.510
Those are ours!

1730
01:34:20.670 --> 01:34:22.550
I'm taking these with me.

1731
01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.010
I'm taking all of these with me.

1732
01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:26.470
I want all of these boxed up,
and I'm taking them.

1733
01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:27.760
You're trespassing!

1734
01:34:27.930 --> 01:34:29.180
It's not your patent!

1735
01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.520
These are my designs!

1736
01:34:32.850 --> 01:34:35.190
I'm not going anywhere without my molds.

1737
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:37.690
What? No. No.

1738
01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:40.150
This is not stealing,
this is my property!

1739
01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:41.440
This is my property.

1740
01:34:41.610 --> 01:34:44.950
I have all of these designs.
These are all mine. They belong to me!

1741
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:48.740
She's from out of state, John!
You've known me 15 years!

1742
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:50.540
All right, come on, ma'am.
You're trespassing.

1743
01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:52.290
-What?
-Yeah. Come on.

1744
01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:53.830
-I'm not trespassing.
-Yeah, you're trespassing.

1745
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
I was in his office.

1746
01:34:55.170 --> 01:34:56.540
-You don't know. Come on.
-He let me into his...

1747
01:34:56.710 --> 01:34:58.090
Gerhardt, you're not gonna
get away with this.

1748
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:59.670
-You're not gonna get away with this!
-Be careful what you're saying.

1749
01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.760
-You're a thief! You're a thief, Gerhardt!
-Be careful, come on, come on.

1750
01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:03.130
Be careful. Come on, stop it.

1751
01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:05.380
-This is stealing!
-Hey, hey, stop it. Come on.

1752
01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:06.550
All right.

1753
01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:11.600
Watch your step. All right.

1754
01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:20.900
What about Trudy's money, Joy?

1755
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:23.070
You have to pay back Trudy's money.

1756
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.780
This is only getting worse.

1757
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:26.820
I predicted tragedy, Joy.

1758
01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.200
You're racking up quite a steep bill.

1759
01:35:29.370 --> 01:35:32.490
We had to fly out here, bail you out.

1760
01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:35.660
Plus it cost us an extra $10,000
for Ray Cagney...

1761
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:38.210
this California patent attorney,
to get us to this point.

1762
01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:40.880
We got the state to decline prosecution.

1763
01:35:41.050 --> 01:35:43.130
They see it's a contract dispute.

1764
01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:46.800
When you paid royalties
to Derek Markham in Texas...

1765
01:35:46.970 --> 01:35:50.930
it put all your parts and molds
under the umbrella of their patent.

1766
01:35:51.930 --> 01:35:55.060
I see you brought your drawings
and hung them to prove your design.

1767
01:35:55.230 --> 01:35:57.730
But it's impossible to fight it now.

1768
01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:00.360
You were not properly advised.

1769
01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:03.070
Cristy, please!

1770
01:36:03.230 --> 01:36:04.230
Tony, take her to bed.

1771
01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.530
I don't wanna go to bed.
I wanna stay here.

1772
01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:08.070
I paid those royalties...

1773
01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:09.240
because you told me to.

1774
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:12.120
Because your lawyer told me to.

1775
01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:16.040
Our lawyer was mistaken.
This happens sometimes in business.

1776
01:36:16.210 --> 01:36:17.410
It didn't work out for you.

1777
01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:18.620
It happens sometimes.

1778
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:20.130
Trudy's lawyer is not a patent attorney.

1779
01:36:20.290 --> 01:36:21.630
Which I said!

1780
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:25.760
And you said I had no business
being Joy's advisor.

1781
01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:27.670
-And now it turns out that I was right!
-This is not helpful, Tony!

1782
01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.760
-That's enough, Tony. Please.
-It's enough, now?

1783
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:32.550
I'm very sorry.
I wish there was more I could do.

1784
01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:35.850
But when your sister Peggy paid
the unjustified bills...

1785
01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:37.680
that you refused to pay...

1786
01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:39.310
it closed the door on that.

1787
01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:41.190
What about Neil Walker and QVC?

1788
01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.860
Wouldn't they pay the expenses
on defending the patent?

1789
01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:45.610
Be careful, Joy.

1790
01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:49.400
You could be sued for misrepresentation
and failure to deliver your product.

1791
01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:50.570
That's breach.

1792
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:54.780
QVC requires that you deliver
a fully patented product.

1793
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:57.330
I've been doing this for a long time.

1794
01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:01.460
You're in for a long court process
that will stall your product.

1795
01:37:01.630 --> 01:37:03.080
And you will probably lose.

1796
01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:04.670
I wish I could do more.

1797
01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:07.670
Take care, now.

1798
01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:10.090
You're gonna have to accept
the facts, Joy.

1799
01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:11.720
I mean, that's...

1800
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:14.300
You're most of half a million dollars
in debt.

1801
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:16.310
I don't know how you're gonna pay it.

1802
01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.310
We have to declare bankruptcy.

1803
01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:20.890
You're gonna have to declare bankruptcy.

1804
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:22.440
I have to declare bankruptcy.

1805
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:23.610
She has to.

1806
01:37:23.770 --> 01:37:25.190
-To try to contain my losses.
-Yeah.

1807
01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:26.530
I have to write it off.

1808
01:37:26.690 --> 01:37:28.610
It just seems so wrong.

1809
01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:30.320
We've worked so hard.

1810
01:37:30.490 --> 01:37:32.570
We've come so far
for us to just give up now.

1811
01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:34.200
It just seems so unfair!

1812
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:36.870
Business is unfair. That's it.

1813
01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.040
It's not working out.
Well, that's what happens.

1814
01:37:39.210 --> 01:37:42.920
That's why people don't go around
making invention every other day.

1815
01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:44.130
Wake up!

1816
01:37:44.210 --> 01:37:45.210
It's my fault.

1817
01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:48.170
I gave her the confidence to think she was
more than just an unemployed housewife...

1818
01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:51.050
selling plastic kitchen stuff
to other unemployed housewives...

1819
01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:52.300
on a junk cable channel.

1820
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:55.180
It's my fault.
It's not your fault, honey.

1821
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:57.850
It was my mistake to make her think
that she was more than she was.

1822
01:37:58.390 --> 01:38:00.850
She pressured herself into doing
something she shouldn't have done.

1823
01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:03.060
It was wrong of you
to put that pressure on yourself.

1824
01:38:03.230 --> 01:38:05.440
It was wrong of us
to put that pressure on you.

1825
01:38:05.610 --> 01:38:07.070
I need more vodka.

1826
01:38:07.230 --> 01:38:12.860
It was wrong of us to think that you'd be
an instant business person overnight.

1827
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:15.570
Of course, this is not who you are.

1828
01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:21.500
It takes a kind of toughness,
a certain acumen...

1829
01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:24.460
that you simply don't have.

1830
01:38:25.130 --> 01:38:26.460
Sign the paper.

1831
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:33.470
You have to sign
these bankruptcy papers, honey.

1832
01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:36.180
The notary's right outside.
Let me get her.

1833
01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:42.270
You're gonna have to move
out of your house immediately.

1834
01:38:43.190 --> 01:38:44.600
You're gonna have to move
into an apartment.

1835
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:47.440
Maybe you can move into a room
in Trudy's house.

1836
01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:48.730
With the children?

1837
01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.280
Yeah. You have room.

1838
01:38:51.190 --> 01:38:52.610
She's my daughter. Why not?

1839
01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:55.530
Let's talk about it.

1840
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:57.530
Trudy, we have to offer her something.

1841
01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:58.700
Again?

1842
01:38:58.870 --> 01:39:00.080
Why me?

1843
01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.460
Please sign, honey.

1844
01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:36.910
Thank you.

1845
01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:45.080
Mimi said you were the one born
to help carry the family to success.

1846
01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:51.420
No, Cristy. Mimi was wrong.

1847
01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:55.090
The world does not give you opportunities.

1848
01:39:55.260 --> 01:40:00.010
The world destroys your opportunity
and it breaks your heart.

1849
01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:04.270
I should have listened to my mother
when I was 10 years old.

1850
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:05.980
I should have spent the rest of my life...

1851
01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:09.190
watching TV and hiding from the world
like my mother.

1852
01:40:10.110 --> 01:40:12.690
So I don't wanna hear
any more about Mimi.

1853
01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.320
She was wrong.

1854
01:40:14.490 --> 01:40:17.950
She had her head in the clouds
and it was full of stupid ideas.

1855
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:20.280
And it gave me stupid ideas.

1856
01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:23.830
Like this.

1857
01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:28.830
This stupid, stupid idea!

1858
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:34.340
Mommy, don't tear them! No!

1859
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:58.240
Cristy, I'm so sorry.

1860
01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.490
I'm sorry, Cristy.

1861
01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:02.200
I'm so sorry.

1862
01:41:02.370 --> 01:41:04.830
Please go to bed.
Everybody just go to bed.

1863
01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.830
Good night, Mommy.

1864
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.170
Good night, sweetheart. Just go to bed.

1865
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:15.250
I'm so sorry I failed you, Joy.
I'm so sorry.

1866
01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:17.090
Just, just don't.

1867
01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:50.970
Joy? Joy?

1868
01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:53.060
Joy, where are you?

1869
01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:56.810
Joy, where are you?

1870
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:11.800
It's open.

1871
01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:20.900
You can leave the door open.

1872
01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.880
No one knows I'm here.

1873
01:44:49.890 --> 01:44:51.890
You don't even know who I am.

1874
01:44:52.050 --> 01:44:57.560
I could be Derek Markham or I might be someone
Derek Markham sent to handle you.

1875
01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:00.060
You have no case.

1876
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:04.440
Maybe people think you came to Dallas
in despair to take your own life...

1877
01:45:04.610 --> 01:45:09.570
because you were in such deep financial trouble
suddenly from your little venture.

1878
01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:19.540
I made a phone call this morning
to Hong Kong.

1879
01:45:20.210 --> 01:45:25.250
It was 1:00 a.m. in California but it was
5:00 p.m. the following afternoon in Hong Kong.

1880
01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:29.760
I always think it's amazing
how time works like that.

1881
01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:34.600
And I was fortunate enough to get
on the phone with Mr. Christopher...

1882
01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:37.810
who I found to be very friendly,
which was surprising...

1883
01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:41.100
because I really haven't found
the gentlemen in California to be very nice...

1884
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:43.650
considering we're all
in business together.

1885
01:45:43.810 --> 01:45:47.610
Welcome to the world of business,
I guess.

1886
01:45:48.650 --> 01:45:50.950
I told Mr. Christopher
that the reason that I was calling...

1887
01:45:51.110 --> 01:45:55.120
was to discuss the differences
in the designs of our products.

1888
01:45:55.780 --> 01:46:00.120
But I quickly learned
that Mr. Christopher has no idea...

1889
01:46:00.290 --> 01:46:06.460
if his Hong Kong patent for a self-wringing mop
is worth anything or if it even works.

1890
01:46:07.090 --> 01:46:12.130
Because they have not made
or sold a single mop.

1891
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:16.140
Unlike us, who have sold over 200,000.

1892
01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:22.020
And I've paid you over $50,000
in advanced royalties...

1893
01:46:22.190 --> 01:46:24.150
on behalf of Mr. Christopher.

1894
01:46:24.690 --> 01:46:29.610
Blood money from my family
and my second mortgage.

1895
01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:35.160
Turns out Mr. Christopher doesn't know
anything about those royalties.

1896
01:46:35.370 --> 01:46:36.820
So it seems...

1897
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:41.620
we have a case of fraud and embezzlement.

1898
01:46:44.670 --> 01:46:47.840
And, as if that weren't bad enough...

1899
01:46:48.710 --> 01:46:54.220
I also discovered in the paperwork that our mops
actually don't bear any similarities.

1900
01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:57.510
So I never did owe you
any royalties for your patent.

1901
01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.520
That's another case of fraud.

1902
01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:07.060
My lawyers really could go after you,
but I told them, "Give me a day."

1903
01:47:07.230 --> 01:47:13.190
To see if maybe
you might've made a mistake...

1904
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:17.990
that you would correct,
given the chance.

1905
01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:36.380
We'll pay you back all the royalties
you paid us.

1906
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:46.060
I'll give you $20,000
on top of paying you back the 50.

1907
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:59.240
Okay.

1908
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:04.700
I'll give you $50,000
on top of paying you back the 50.

1909
01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:18.380
Plus interest.

1910
01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:25.810
I want all of my molds back.

1911
01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:28.770
I want you to sign
this piece of paper...

1912
01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:33.110
saying that you have
no rights, financially.

1913
01:48:34.110 --> 01:48:37.610
I'm just gonna add...
I said the 50...

1914
01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.660
plus the 50...

1915
01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:46.120
plus the interest.

1916
01:48:46.290 --> 01:48:50.420
So I just want you to initial
next to those two numbers as well.

1917
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:57.970
So just sign there.

1918
01:49:05.970 --> 01:49:08.480
She put up with just about anything.

1919
01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:11.940
Until when she had to
bring the hammer down...

1920
01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.150
she brought the hammer down.

1921
01:49:17.490 --> 01:49:20.150
She couldn't know what was to come.

1922
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:25.120
That she'd go on to make
another 100 record-setting patents.

1923
01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:29.620
Skinny velvet hangers
make neater closets.

1924
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:32.120
That's a big deal to a lot of people.

1925
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:35.710
I mean, who thinks of things like that?

1926
01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.170
Joy did.

1927
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:47.680
She didn't know any of this would happen
as she walked down the street that day.

1928
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:52.350
Yes, sir, tonight's the night for Ol' Saint Nick
to make his yearly visit...

1929
01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.520
to all the folks all over the world.

1930
01:49:54.690 --> 01:49:58.190
There's fun and expectation
in every house across the land.

1931
01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:02.450
And speaking of houses, what do you say
we take a little look-in on a typical one?

1932
01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:10.870
Now I'll admit that what you see right now
is just a small piece of the front of the house...

1933
01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:14.830
but all you grownups and kids alike,
this is the time for Santa's magic...

1934
01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.170
so I think we can make it
become a real house.

1935
01:50:19.050 --> 01:50:20.510
Even a house with love in it.

1936
01:50:20.670 --> 01:50:23.720
Mr. Santa Claus, can we have
a little snow, please?

1937
01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:27.720
Thank you. That's fine.

1938
01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:32.060
Now, Santa, let me see what it
really looks like inside this house.

1939
01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:05.930
She couldn't know that one day
she would move into a big beautiful home.

1940
01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:10.770
Her mother was happy.

1941
01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:15.770
She remained close to her,
and with the rest of her family...

1942
01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:18.690
which was, as always, complicated.

1943
01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:26.030
She would pay for products made by
Rudy, Trudy, and Peggy.

1944
01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:28.280
Even when they failed.

1945
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:33.700
Even when they wrongly sued
for ownership of her company.

1946
01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:39.290
As Rudy got older,
Joy continued to take care of him and love him.

1947
01:51:45.130 --> 01:51:50.810
As Neil Walker predicted,
Joy did become a whole new business.

1948
01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:53.220
And even outgrew QVC.

1949
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:55.140
-She's talking to her children.
-Is Tony in there?

1950
01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.730
Yes, Tony's in there.
The family's in there.

1951
01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:03.070
Her ex-husband and her best friend
would remain her steadfast advisers.

1952
01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:04.570
Please be patient.

1953
01:52:10.330 --> 01:52:12.490
I love you.
You guys go and pack your rooms.

1954
01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:14.450
-Good night, Mom.
-I love you.

1955
01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:24.590
-Hi.
-Hi.

1956
01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:26.420
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

1957
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:30.180
What do you have?

1958
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:32.010
A traveling clothes cleaner.

1959
01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:33.180
Let's see it.

1960
01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:35.310
So you're from Memphis?

1961
01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:36.680
Yes, I am.

1962
01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:38.020
You work as a waitress?

1963
01:52:38.190 --> 01:52:39.350
Yes, ma'am.

1964
01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:42.020
All right. Let's see it.

1965
01:52:43.530 --> 01:52:44.690
You made this yourself?

1966
01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:45.860
Yes, I did, ma'am.

1967
01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:49.110
I made my first invention myself, too.

1968
01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:52.530
I like this, it's a very good design.

1969
01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:53.740
Thank you.

1970
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:56.330
Can you stay an extra day,
meet with our designers?

1971
01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:58.370
No, because of your boss?

1972
01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.790
What hotel are you staying in right now?

1973
01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:03.540
-The Holiday Inn, ma'am.
-Holiday Inn.

1974
01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:05.670
Let's move them over to the Radisson,
get them a suite.

1975
01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:07.380
You'll be more comfortable
with your baby.

1976
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:10.340
I'll call your boss and get it taken care of,
give you an extra day...

1977
01:53:10.510 --> 01:53:12.510
so that tomorrow you can come in,
meet with the designers.

1978
01:53:12.970 --> 01:53:14.720
-We can take it step by step, all right?
-Thank you.

1979
01:53:14.970 --> 01:53:16.640
We'll work on your idea,
see if we can do something.

1980
01:53:16.810 --> 01:53:18.640
This means so much to me.

1981
01:53:18.890 --> 01:53:20.390
I know what it feels like.

1982
01:53:20.850 --> 01:53:22.900
I know what it feels like
to be in that chair.

1983
01:53:23.570 --> 01:53:25.520
-We'll see you tomorrow, okay?
-Thank you, ma'am.

1984
01:53:25.650 --> 01:53:26.900
And good luck.

1985
01:53:27.190 --> 01:53:28.530
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

1986
01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:31.410
-Go get the next person, Tony.
-Okay.

1987
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:32.910
Neil.

1988
01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:37.160
Sorry, we have legal stuff
with Barry, now.

1989
01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:41.920
Yes, we do.

1990
01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:44.750
Here we are.

1991
01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:46.090
Here we are.

1992
01:53:47.710 --> 01:53:49.760
Adversaries in commerce.

1993
01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:52.760
Adversaries in commerce.

1994
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:55.720
-And friends.
-Yes.

1995
01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:57.390
And friends.

1996
01:53:58.810 --> 01:54:01.270
I'm gonna tell you something
but you didn't hear it from me.

1997
01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:03.730
I don't know who you are
or what you're talking about.

1998
01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:05.520
That's what I wanted to hear.

1999
01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:09.240
Barry's gonna come after you, hard.

2000
01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:12.780
But that's just business.
That's the way Barry is. He's a negotiator.

2001
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:15.120
UItimately, he needs you.

2002
01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:18.450
He's buying HSN.

2003
01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:21.960
It's all about HSN now,
and he wants you to come with him.

2004
01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:25.920
He needs you.

2005
01:54:26.710 --> 01:54:28.800
You're going to be very big over there.

2006
01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:31.260
That's what's going to happen.

2007
01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:34.470
But, you didn't hear it from me, right?

2008
01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:39.270
No, I sure didn't.
But thank you.

2009
01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:44.520
It's nice to see you.

2010
01:54:44.690 --> 01:54:46.270
It's good to see you.

2011
01:54:48.570 --> 01:54:50.610
I'll see you around, pal.

2012
01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:52.740
Yeah.

2013
01:54:59.910 --> 01:55:01.000
It's been a long journey.

2014
01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:02.160
Yes, it has.

2015
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:03.330
I'm proud of you.

2016
01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:04.710
Thank you, Neil.

2017
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:42.410
This right here,
this is a special power.

2018
01:55:44.290 --> 01:55:46.170
This is a special power.

2019
01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.170
And then I started to build my very own house...

2020
01:55:55.930 --> 01:55:58.550
where I would live
and make wonderful creations...

2021
01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:02.060
for all the world to see and love.

2022
01:56:07.730 --> 01:56:10.230
She didn't know any of this would happen...

2023
01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:13.280
as she walked that day.
