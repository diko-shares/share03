(soap opera music playing)

2
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.631
It doesn't make sense. I don't understand

3
00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.467
how something like this happened.

4
00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.928
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

5
00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.930
This has been my whole life,
and now it's gone.

6
00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:57.849
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

7
00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:02.020
Pendleton Industries is all I've ever known.

8
00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:04.522
And now it's all been taken away.

9
00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.109
DANICA: When someone
sees a weakness in me,

10
00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:10.612
I turn that weakness into a strength.

11
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.991
(gasps)

12
00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.286
Danica, you're so strong.

13
00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.791
I don't think I could do
anything like this.

14
00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:25.668
You can imagine changing your life...

15
00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:28.338
by fighting for the deed
to the land, Clarinda.

16
00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:32.425
Which is only possible if Bartholomew
is no longer living.

17
00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.802
(door opens)

18
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.681
You will never get
the deed to the land again.

19
00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:40.767
I will never allow it.

20
00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.269
Put down that gun,
you silly girl.

21
00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:46.106
Watch your step, Bartholomew.

22
00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.982
Ridge is on his way.

23
00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.151
And he's still in love with Clarinda.

24
00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.154
And Jared loves me.

25
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.948
Clarinda...

26
00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.950
it's true.

27
00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.201
I'm here for you.

It's okay. It's okay, Mitzy.

MIMI: <i>A father.</i>

<i>Joy was one of those people</i>
<i>who rejoiced in making things.</i>

52
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:58.238
And I open the gate
to the big green meadow.

53
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.366
And I went into the forest.

54
00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:04.285
And there, I conquered many dangers.

55
00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.080
A wolf...

56
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.415
and other scary things.

57
00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:12.627
And then I started to build
my very own house...

58
00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.420
where I would live...

59
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:17.757
and make wonderful creations
for all the world...

60
00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.717
to see and have.

61
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:21.761
And maybe for the prince and princess...

62
00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.514
who lived across the forest,
in the castle.

63
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:25.682
See?

64
00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.101
And they were in love.

65
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.769
And maybe they'd invite me over...

66
00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.813
because of the things that I made.

67
00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.816
YOUNG PEGGY: <i>You need</i>

68

70
00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:43.783

75
00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:59.924
I have something for you.

76
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.551
Oh, Danica...

77
00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:03.636
You're so strong.

78
00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:06.222
I don't think I could ever do
something like this.

79
00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:13.646
MIMI: <i>I always felt it was</i>
<i>for me to encourage her.</i>

80
00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.274
<i>So I said...</i>

81
00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:21.779
You are going to grow up and be a strong,
smart young woman...

82
00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:27.368
go to school, meet a fine young man,
have beautiful children of your own...

83
00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:32.999
and you're gonna build wonderful things
that you do in your room.

84
00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:34.083
Okay?

85
00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.586

Mother, I can't find my lanyard for work.

89
00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.593
They're not gonna let me through
airport security without it.

90
00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.053
Joy, you can't find your lanyard?

91
00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:47.221
-Can I help you?
-No, but I...

92
00:05:47.388 --> 00:05:48.473
Honey, listen.

93
00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.810
I know life hasn't gone as we discussed
many times, sweetheart.

94
00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:55.605
And you don't exactly have
your whole life ahead of you...

95
00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:58.524
but you still have a good portion
of it, anyway.

96
00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.486
Hope springs eternal.

97
00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:04.197
-Thanks, Mimi.
-Sure.

98
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.949
Mother, look what I did find.

99
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.786
What is that?

100
00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:11.829
How can you ask what this is?

101
00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.791
The dog collar I invented
in high school.

102
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.043
Remember Mitzy choked a couple of times?

103
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.587
So I invented a dog collar
with a quick release...

104
00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:20.838
so that a dog would never choke...

105
00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:24.592
and I covered it with reflective tape,
plus it's a flea collar.

106
00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.470
I probably wouldn't be late to this job
I'm going to...

107
00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.222
if you'd gotten me a patent or a lawyer.

108
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.266
Joy the doer, Joy the doer.
You were always doing things, honey.

109
00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.685
How could I be expected
to remember everything?

110
00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:37.522
JOY: Now the Hartz company
has the patent to that collar.

111
00:06:37.688 --> 00:06:39.607
I don't know how to get a patent.

112
00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:41.901
What is that smell? (sniffs)

113
00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:44.946
Oh! How did you get
yogurt down here, Mother?

114
00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.657
TERRY: I was wondering
what that odor was.

115
00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:49.826
JOY: It's starting to mold for Pete's sake.

116
00:06:49.992 --> 00:06:54.080
Yes, I am, because I feel like I cannot
have the life bled out of me this way.

117
00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.083
Joy, look who's back.
Look who's back!

118
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.793
Yes, Bartholomew is back.

119
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.545
CLARINDA: No, no.

120
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.838
I thought Bartholomew was dead?

121
00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:03.005
BARTHOLOMEW: And I'm a ghost.

122
00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:05.049
He came back as a ghost with
even greater powers.

123
00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:06.259
CLARINDA: Ghost, you go away!

124
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.344
BARTHOLOMEW: My powers
are even greater now.

125
00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.555
CLARINDA: I cannot handle this.
How is this possible?

126
00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.056
RODERICK: Stay away from him.

127
00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.058
Clarinda, you don't know
what a ghost can do to you!

128
00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.643
BARTHOLOMEW:
Even from beyond the grave.

-(doorbell rings)
-(knocking on door)

130
00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.230
Grandma's gonna take you
to the birthday party, okay?

131
00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:20.398
Five minutes.

132
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.402
Hi. What are you doing here?

133
00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.779
I'm returning him to you.
I don't want him anymore.

134
00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:27.947
What?

135
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:29.699
He's damaged.

136
00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.325
He has no place else to go.

137
00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:33.578
He's been living
in my house for two years.

138
00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:35.663
Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry.

139
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.291
But you know,
Tony's living in the basement.

140
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.460
Your ex-husband shouldn't be living
in your basement.

141
00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:42.462
That's not the proper way to be divorced.

142
00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:45.673
Okay. I don't know
where I'm gonna put you.

143
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.592
Dad, don't go in there. Mom's in there.

144
00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:48.676
(gasps)

145
00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:51.345
SHARON: You can have him back, Terry.
I don't want him anymore.

146
00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.055
What was so much better about
being with Sharon, Rudy?

147
00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:54.348
Dad, don't answer that.

148
00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:56.476
We went to
the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

149
00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:57.727
TERRY: What did you like at the museum?

150
00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.145
RUDY: What did I like?
I'll tell you what I like.

151
00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:03.149
I like the ancient Roman statues.
I like the medieval armor.

152
00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.026
I like the Etruscan jewelry.

153
00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.737
-Museums are full of dust and death.
-RUDY: I like going to the café...

154
00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:10.031
having an expresso, a nice panini,
that's what I like.

155
00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:12.200
You had a panini in a coffin, Rudy.

156
00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:15.244
-A dusty, boring coffin. Yuck.
-RUDY: Then why'd you ask me?

157
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:16.871
What are you, a crazy person?
It's like having

158
00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.206
a conversation
with an insane asylum person.

159
00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:19.749
What else, Captain Jack?
What else was so great?

160
00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.501
Captain Jack, you're calling me. Okay.

161
00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:22.710
Yes, you're Captain Jack,
the flying jackass.

162
00:08:22.793 --> 00:08:23.794
Yeah, and you know what you are?

163
00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.338
You're like a gas leak.
We don't smell you,

164
00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:26.964
-we don't see you, but you're...
-I am not a gas leak!

165
00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.382
-...killing us all silently.
-You take that back...

166
00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:29.467
and tell me what else you did
with Sharon!

167
00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.010
You creature from the Black Lagoon.

168
00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.553
No! This conversation is over.

169
00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:33.679
SHARON: I'm leaving. Good luck.

170
00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:35.556
TERRY: Oh, my God. Here it goes.
Watch out, Joy.

171
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.682
-He's gonna snap!
-(door closes)

00:08:36.724 --> 00:08:38.893
Oh, please. You want me to snap.
That's your whole routine. You...

173
00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.019
TERRY: Guard the china!

174
00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.188
-Hey, Terry, you like this?
-JOY: Dad, no!

175
00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.898
-How's this for snapping?
-(gasps)

176
00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:45.691
-No! No.
-How's this?

177
00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.319
This is snapping!

178
00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:50.821
JOY: Dad! Stop!
TERRY: He's disturbed, Joy!

179
00:08:50.988 --> 00:08:52.240
He's a disturbed man!

180
00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:54.242
-I'm disturbed?
-He's a damaged man!

181
00:08:54.408 --> 00:08:56.077
You're right, I am disturbed.

182
00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.662
You're the great disturber!

183
00:08:58.579 --> 00:08:59.580
I'm sorry, honey.

184
00:08:59.747 --> 00:09:00.873
I don't like this.

185
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.583
You're not supposed to see
this kind of thing.

186
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.002
I'm very, very sorry.
I apologize sincerely.

187
00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:08.172
RIDGE (on TV): It's not gonna happen, okay?
We have other...

188
00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:09.840
I'm gonna clean all this up.

189
00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:11.717
Dad, no. Don't clean it up.

190
00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:13.886
Dad, stop. Just don't, okay?

191
00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:17.890
Stop. I'll do it.
I just want to get you out of this room.

192
00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:20.935
Thank you.

193
00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.728
Hi, guys.
I'm sorry about all the yelling.

194
00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.939
Mimi's gonna take you
to the birthday party, okay?

195
00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:26.566
Hi, my sweethearts.

196
00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.734
-You broke things again.
-He did break stuff.

197
00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.570
I did break some things,
but Grandma was wrong.

198
00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.947
So I was a little wrong,
but she was really wrong.

199
00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:35.116
But Grandpa's gonna come
stay with us for a little while.

200
00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.742
ALL: Yay!

201
00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:39.620
A sleepover with Grandpa! Yay!

202
00:09:39.787 --> 00:09:43.291
Sharon never separated the wash.
The whites were always grey.

203
00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:44.625
But you have that magic touch, sweetheart,

204
00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:45.751
so could I give this to you, please?

205
00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:46.794
Yeah, I'll take care of it, yeah.

206
00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.462
-Just get your bag.
-What about my ledgers

207
00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:49.630
and all that stuff? My accounting books?

208
00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:50.798
I got them.
I'll get them to you later today.

209
00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.425
-I love you, Grandpa.
-RUDY: Love you.

210
00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.885
JOY: I did your taxes, I did your W-2s.
RUDY: Okay. Very important.

211
00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:58.306
(Tony singing in Spanish)

212
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.652
-RUDY: You suck!
-(music stops)

213
00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:12.820
What is he doing here?

214
00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.071
Sharon brought him back...

215
00:10:14.238 --> 00:10:18.242
so he's gonna stay with us until he finds
a new love or a new place to live.

216
00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:19.660
You know how this goes.

217
00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.163
(both speaking Spanish)

218
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:31.172
Dad, up.

219
00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.673
(Tony continues in Spanish)

220
00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.843
This is not the proper way to be divorced,
the two of you.

221
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.511
You're gonna tell me how to be divorced?

222
00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:38.846
I'm a provider, Tom Jones.

223
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.097
-I have my own business.
-(laughs)

224
00:10:40.264 --> 00:10:41.766
I help Joy with the mortgage.
What do you do?

225
00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:44.018
You sing all night
at Angela Starpoli's club.

226
00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.354
You get repeatedly fired
from Campbell's Soup.

227
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.439
Okay, well, I'm gonna divide the basement.

228
00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:50.358
I'm divorced.
I can do whatever I want, Rudy.

229
00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:51.859
RUDY: This is not
the proper way to be divorced.

230
00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.694
JOY: And I'm about to be late for work.

231
00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:56.364
So please try not to fight
in front of the children, okay?

232
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.657
Especially not physically.

233
00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:00.284
TONY: Rudy, you see this?
This microphone here?

234
00:11:00.868 --> 00:11:03.537
You touch it, and I kill you.

235
00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:06.874
Okay. I'm leaving.

236
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:09.168
Please try not to kill each other
while I'm gone.

237
00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.379
RODERICK: You've gone mad.
This is all your fault!

238
00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:13.297
Clarinda. Clarinda! Don't.

239
00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:16.217
Clarinda, something terrible happened!
Stay away from him!

240
00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:22.723
Oh, my God.
I thought I fixed this thing.

241
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.809
PEGGY: Nice job, Joy. Nice job.

242
00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:27.895
Peggy? What are you doing here?

243
00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:31.399
What's the matter with you?
Sending Grandma Mimi with her arthritis...

244
00:11:31.565 --> 00:11:33.234
to take them to their friend's birthday?

245
00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:34.568
Oh, I'm fine.

246
00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:38.030
PEGGY: They have a much better time
with me anyway, with Aunt Peggy.

247
00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:40.032
-MIMI: Uh-uh.
-But I wasn't stupid enough

248
00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.076
to get into a bad marriage
and have a couple of kids.

249
00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.411
MIMI: Don't bother your sister, Peggy.

250
00:11:43.577 --> 00:11:46.080
I'm gonna talk to Dad about business.
All right?

251
00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:47.832
You gonna come bring the books
by the garage later?

252
00:11:47.998 --> 00:11:49.500
Yeah, I'm gonna bring them later.
He's in the basement.

253
00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:50.668
I'm joking with you.

254
00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:51.919
(sighs) Yeah. I know.

255
00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:54.255
PEGGY: Kids, we're gonna do
something fun later, okay?

256
00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.090
MIMI: We're doing something fun now.

257
00:12:02.763 --> 00:12:05.182
JOY: Oh, we found your luggage
but it's in Cleveland.

258
00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:06.934
So now we just need to get it back
to New York City.

259
00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:08.269
WOMAN: I'm filing a complaint.

260
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.272
My husband needs his medication.

261
00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:13.274
What's your name? Joy?

262
00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.192
You don't seem joyous to me today.

263
00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:17.111
Perhaps I am not so joyous today.

264
00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.405
-Joy, I think you're getting demoted.
-Hi, how you doing?

265
00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.115
Listen, I need you to speak
to the supervisor.

266
00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.117
We're gonna be having some changes,

267
00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:24.910
and you're gonna be
going to the night hours.

268
00:12:24.952 --> 00:12:26.787
Night hours? Tom, I can't work night hours.

269
00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:28.289
-And we're having cutbacks.
-I've got two kids.

270
00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:29.582
SUSAN: Joy, I'm sorry. Good luck.

271
00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:30.708
Bye, Susan.

272
00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:33.294
WOMAN:
<i>♪ I want to be happy ♪</i>

273
00:12:33.377 --> 00:12:35.296
<i>♪ But I won't be happy ♪</i>

274
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:36.464
(men laughing)

275
00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:38.257
<i>♪ Till I make you happy, too ♪</i>

276
00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.800

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:44.472

280
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.647
RUDY: I'm not paying for metal
that I haven't gotten.

281
00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.733
On top of me send...
You know, he wants to get paid.

282
00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:57.943
He doesn't send an invoice,
and he hasn't even sent the metal.

283
00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:02.156
But why doesn't he just send the invoice?
Send the invoice, I'll pay him.

284
00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.658
Yep. That's it. Send the invoice.

285
00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:09.163
Hi. Dad, I want to thank you again
for helping with the mortgage.

286
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.748
Yeah.

287
00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:12.333
I settled the accounts,

288
00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:14.126
-balanced the books.
-Thank you.

289
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:15.920
I'm sorry business is so bad, Dad.

290
00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:18.589
I don't think that
that crazy gun range is helping.

291
00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:20.508
How is that still legal?

292
00:13:20.674 --> 00:13:22.468
-What can I do?
-After all these years?

293
00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.303
They keep to themselves.

294
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.347
It's their property.
The police leave them alone.

295
00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.182
Why? You think it's costing us business?

296
00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:29.683
-I don't think it's helping.
-(door opens)

297
00:13:30.684 --> 00:13:33.103
Well, if you wanna help, why don't you
come here and manage this place?

298
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.940
You know, I'd like to go the next level.
Put on a nice suit.

299
00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:38.025
You know, go out there
and get some accounts.

300
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.610
Shh.

301
00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:43.823
Yeah, this is 9873.
Just checking my mailbox.

302
00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:45.199
What is that?

303
00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:46.534
Yeah, I have a pen. What is it?

304
00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:49.203
13-14. That's it?

305
00:13:49.453 --> 00:13:50.621
Thank you.

306
00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:52.164
What was that?

307
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.375
It's a 900 number.

308
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:55.876
What's a 900 number?

309
00:13:56.544 --> 00:14:00.172
It's, you know, a dating service
for widows and widowers.

310
00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:01.465
JOY: Dating service?

311
00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:02.883
You're not a widow or a widower.

312
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.301
What's the difference? I'm single.

313
00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:07.346
I meet nice ladies.
Maybe we fall in love.

314
00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:09.890
I have to fall in love or I'm not interested.
You know me.

315
00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:11.976
-I know, Dad.
-Shh.

316
00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:14.937
(whispering) Sharon was no good for him.
It's nice for him to meet somebody new.

317
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.064
-I got him some new clothes, you know?
-Okay. Okay.

318
00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:18.732
-RUDY: Hello? Is this 7633?
-It's good.

319
00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:19.900
Okay. I love you. See you later.

320
00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.819
-WOMAN (on phone): Yes?
-Bye.

321
00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.737
Hi. This is 9833.

322
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:26.323
Oh! Hi! Hi, how are you?

323
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.908
-What a nice voice you have.
-(door closes)

324
00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.243
Oh, thank you.

325
00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:31.662
RUDY: Oh, an accent.
WOMAN: Yes.

326
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:33.080
I am from Italy.

327
00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:35.416
-RUDY: Oh! Continental.
-Mmm-hmm.

328
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.584
What is your name?

329
00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:37.751
My name is Rudy,

330
00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:39.420
-what's yours?
-Trudy.

331
00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:41.755
-Are you kidding me?
-(laughing) No.

332
00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:42.923
Your name is Trudy?

333
00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:44.049
Yes!

334
00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:45.551
Rudy and Trudy. I love it.

335
00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:48.387
Let's figure out when we're gonna meet.

336
00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.598
That's a good idea. Let's have dinner.

337
00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:52.266
-I could come pick you up.
-Yeah.

338
00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:53.767
I have a green Mercedes.

339
00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:55.936
Okay, 6:30? I'll be ready.

340
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.021
Ciao.

341
00:14:57.104 --> 00:14:58.230
(hangs up)

342
00:14:58.272 --> 00:14:59.690
Good luck with your date, Dad.

343
00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:01.108
RUDY: Thank you. I'm excited.

344
00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:02.776
What do you think you're gonna wear?

345
00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:06.405
Polo by Ralph Lauren.

346
00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:07.573
Did you have to use the whole

347
00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:09.158
-bottle of cologne? Huh?
-JOY: Tony!

348
00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:11.076
You smell like my grandmother.
He smells like my grandmother.

349
00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:12.912
Hey, please. Don't make me tense.

350
00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:15.915
Don't stress me out.
I gotta stay nice and loose.

351
00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:18.292
TONY: Now you're tense?
RUDY: I'm tense. You're making me tense.

352
00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.460
Guys, stop. Please.

353
00:15:19.543 --> 00:15:20.753
-TONY: I'm making you tense?
-(car horn honking)

354
00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:21.962
My carriage awaits.

355
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:23.422
Have a great date.

356
00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:24.590
Wish me luck.

357
00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:25.799
You don't need it.

358
00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.009
(door closes)

359
00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:28.302
Joy, water!

360
00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:29.470
TONY: Where are my cufflinks?

361
00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.430
CRISTY: Mommy, come read to me!

362
00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:32.556
Five minutes, Cristy.

363
00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:33.974
Mother, again?

364
00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:37.478
(groans) Yeah, you just sit right there.
Are you comfortable?

365
00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:43.150
How many times do I have to tell you
not to clean your brushes out in the sink!

366
00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:45.778
Danica thinks it's unladylike
to toss things in the toilet.

367
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.112
And I happen to agree.

368
00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:49.490
Yeah? Well, why don't you have
Danica do your plumbing then?

369
00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:53.285
Danica can direct her power
anywhere Danica chooses.

370
00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.829
-That is the power of Danica.
-(floorboards creaking)

371
00:15:55.996 --> 00:15:57.331
(grunts)

372
00:15:58.499 --> 00:15:59.792
JOY: Oh, my God.

373
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.169
If this problem gets any worse...

374
00:16:03.253 --> 00:16:05.464
we're gonna have to move you
into a different room.

375
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.132
That means no TV.

376
00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:09.510
That could be very scary for you.

377
00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:13.347
Don't let that happen, Joy.
This is my comfort nest.

378
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.350
(sighs) We're gonna need to get
a plumber in here.

379
00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:17.601
TERRY: What?

380
00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:21.021
(stammers) There's gonna...
A man in my room?

381
00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:23.440
JOY: Well, I don't know
any female plumbers other than me.

382
00:16:23.607 --> 00:16:25.025
Well, can't you fix it, Joy?

383
00:16:25.192 --> 00:16:27.611
This has surpassed my capabilities.

384
00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:28.862
Thanks, Joy.

385
00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:32.700
"The cicada is a large flying insect
two to three inches long.

386
00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:36.453
"It makes a sound of up to 120 decibels,
louder than some telephones.

387
00:16:37.287 --> 00:16:40.874
"It lives half of its life above ground
evading predators."

388
00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:42.668
This is the book you wanted me
to read to you, Cristy?

389
00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.211
How did this book even get in the house?

390
00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:46.296
Aunt Peggy got it for me.

391
00:16:46.463 --> 00:16:50.884
She said the reason I like cicadas
is because they fill the air with sound...

392
00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:53.137
which makes the house less lonelier for me.

393
00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:57.182
Aunt Peggy tells you how you feel
about the house being lonely?

394
00:16:57.349 --> 00:16:58.809
Aunt Peggy tells me a lot of things.

395
00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:00.352
Keep reading, please.

396
00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:04.314
I don't want you
listening to Aunt Peggy too much.

397
00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:05.858
Okay. Why?

398
00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:09.528
"The cicada,
a symbol of rebirth in many countries...

399
00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:13.365
"digs into the ground and stays buried
for up to 17 years."

400
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:17.077
That's such a random number.
Why 17 years?

401
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:18.996
It doesn't even say why.

402
00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:22.166
I understand the four seasons in a year...

403
00:17:22.332 --> 00:17:24.752
but why would something
stay hidden for 17 years?

404
00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:27.588
That's just unsettling.
I'm not reading this.

405
00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:29.840
You're sleepy anyway.
We gotta go to bed.

406
00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:32.885
I wanna sleep with Nana.

407
00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:34.511
No, you should sleep upstairs
in your room.

408
00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:36.263
I want Nana.

409
00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:38.015
(Joy sighs)

410
00:17:38.098 --> 00:17:39.933
All right. Well, watch out.
There's a hole here.

411
00:17:46.273 --> 00:17:48.108
Just going to lay down for a second.

412
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.362
I feel like I'm in a prison.

413
00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:55.115
No, Bartholomew's the ex-con
in the story.

414
00:17:55.282 --> 00:17:57.242
And Clarinda doesn't even know about it.

415
00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:59.078
But Danica's onto him.

416
00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:02.873
They all blame Clarinda
but Danica's gonna get to the bottom of it.

417
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.124
No. No.

418
00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:06.710
-Yes. It was you Clarinda.
-(Joy breathing heavily)

419
00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:08.128
I will get to the bottom of this.

420
00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:09.922
You've made terrible mistakes.

421
00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:11.465
It was Clarinda!

422
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.926
(hymn playing)

423
00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:15.302
Oh.

424
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:16.470
Look who's here.

425
00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:17.638
Look who's here.

426
00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.139
Look who's here.

427
00:18:20.307 --> 00:18:21.308
(continues breathing heavily)

428
00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:27.314
(tires screeching)

429
00:18:40.327 --> 00:18:43.413
YOUNG JOY: We are here today
to remember what was lost...

430
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.833
seventeen years ago.

431
00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:48.085
Do you remember?

432
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.672
RUDY: Peggy comes with me.

433
00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:53.841
Joy spends half the time with us.

434
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:56.093
We'll take her paper forest.

435
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.470
TERRY: That's Joy's special thing,
and it belongs in this house.

436
00:18:58.637 --> 00:18:59.680
RUDY: No, I...

437
00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:12.985
-(doorbell ringing)
-TERRY: Joy.

438
00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:16.029
Joy, wake up!

439
00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.490
Someone's been ringing the doorbell.

440
00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:20.200
(ringing continues)

441
00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:30.878
(knocking on door)

442
00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:33.714
Jackie!

443
00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:35.215
Oh, thank God! It's you.

444
00:19:35.382 --> 00:19:37.384
What happened? I'm worried about you.

445
00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:38.802
-I don't see you any more.
-(exhales)

446
00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:40.679
You don't come to the PTA.

447
00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:43.056
You know how my mom's
always clogging the sink

448
00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.058
with her hair from the brushes?

449
00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:46.518
JACKIE: With the pipes in her room?

450
00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:47.978
Yeah. She did it again.

451
00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:49.396
Again?

452
00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:51.815
Yes, and I had to
bash open a hole in the floor.

453
00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:55.819
There's a huge hole in the floor
of my mother's room and I'm broke.

454
00:19:57.362 --> 00:20:01.074
My father works hard.
He's had some bad breaks.

455
00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:06.914
I hope he gets another girlfriend,
and he'll move out of the basement.

456
00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:08.749
He's in the basement with Tony?

457
00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:11.585
Yes. And they hate each other.

458
00:20:12.252 --> 00:20:13.587
Yes.

459
00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:16.924
It's a disaster.
They won't stop fighting.

460
00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:19.593
I don't know.

461
00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:23.597
But how are you?
How's the family? How is everybody?

462
00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:24.765
Everybody's okay.

463
00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.099
How's work?

464
00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:29.061
My job, I could take it or leave it.

465
00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:32.105
What happened to us, Jackie?

466
00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:34.775
All the things
that we used to dream about.

467
00:20:34.942 --> 00:20:37.903
I feel like they just keep getting
farther and farther away.

468
00:20:38.111 --> 00:20:40.948
JACKIE: Remember the night of the party
where everything started?

469
00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:42.908
-The band was playing.
-(Latin music playing)

470
00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:45.035
<i>Everything was so exciting.</i>

471
00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.578

472
00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.455
Joy, you came!

473
00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:51.208
I'm so glad you came!
This is my boyfriend, Andre.

474
00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:52.584
-Hi, Andre.
-Nice to meet you.

475
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:54.461
Andre, this is my childhood friend, Joy.

476
00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:56.088
Come inside!

477
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.590
-Wow.
-Check my music class, accountant girl.

478
00:20:58.757 --> 00:20:59.800
This is a class?

479
00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:00.968

JOY: And he has all this...
This is his house?

492
00:21:30.747 --> 00:21:32.082
-Yeah, this is his house.
-Wow.

493
00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:33.500
He's from Venezuela.

-Who is that guy?
-Yeah.

495
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.463
That's the music teacher's son.

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.966
Oh, my gosh. (squeals)

497
00:21:42.843 --> 00:21:44.303
You're dancing. Here you go.

498
00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:46.096
(Joy laughing)

499
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.351
What am I doing now?

500
00:21:51.518 --> 00:21:52.686
-You're dancing.
-No.

501
00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:54.021
Let me show you my father's house.

502
00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:55.522
-What?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

503
00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:57.190
TONY: <i>I'm gonna be a singer.</i>

504
00:21:57.357 --> 00:21:58.358
Really?

505
00:21:58.525 --> 00:22:01.153
Yeah. I'm gonna be
the next Tom Jones.

506
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.489
That's a big ambition.
There's only one Tom Jones.

507
00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:08.201
I know, but you can't
let the practical get you down.

508
00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:11.204
You gotta keep going to what you love.

509
00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:13.165
That's true.

510
00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:14.958
That's what my father taught me.

511
00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:19.671
What about you?

512
00:22:21.631 --> 00:22:26.011
I invented a dog collar
that I want to get patented,

513
00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:27.888
but I don't think it ever will.

514
00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:29.556
Uh...

515
00:22:29.639 --> 00:22:32.726
I was valedictorian in high school.

516
00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:37.314
I got into a college in Boston...

517
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:40.567
but I'm staying here
because my parents are getting divorced...

518
00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:42.861
and I'm staying to help my mom.

519
00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:46.823
And I help my dad with business stuff.
Accountant.

520
00:22:46.907 --> 00:22:47.908
Hmm.

521
00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:50.660
Maybe your dreams are on hold right now.

00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:52.162
No?

573
00:25:26.399 --> 00:25:31.738

-Rudolph, please! Enough.

It's true!

Just like my late Morris.

623
00:27:33.526 --> 00:27:35.945
Morris. Now, he was American
and you're Italian,

624
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:37.530
and your name originated how?

625
00:27:37.697 --> 00:27:39.866
My name. My Italian name is Geltrude.

626
00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:41.034
Geltrude.

627
00:27:41.117 --> 00:27:44.537
And then he called me "Trude,"
and then became more American. "Trudy."

628
00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:45.789
Trudy.

629
00:27:45.955 --> 00:27:50.460
Why don't you come with your entire family,

Bring the children,
bring the grandchildren.

631
00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:54.631
Like a motorboat?

632
00:27:54.798 --> 00:27:56.508
No, no, it's a sailboat. 55 feet.

-Wow. That's big. That is big.
-Yeah. Yeah.

634
00:27:58.843 --> 00:28:00.720

We'd bring some nice food,

635
00:28:00.804 --> 00:28:02.138
something to drink, that would be great.

636
00:28:02.305 --> 00:28:07.185
Yeah, but not red wine,
because it might stain the teakwood deck.

637
00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:08.478
It's very precious.

638

for a trade show for his swimwear line.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.942
She's talking to herself. It's strange.

683
00:30:19.108 --> 00:30:20.485
Honey, you should go to bed.

684
00:30:21.277 --> 00:30:23.696
If it was all one continuous loop. Yeah.

685
00:30:23.863 --> 00:30:25.198
(doorbell rings)

686
00:30:27.158 --> 00:30:28.535
Hi, I'm Touissant.

687
00:30:28.701 --> 00:30:30.537
RUDY: Touissant? Who's this guy?

688
00:30:31.538 --> 00:30:32.539
It's not for me. Is it for you?

689
00:30:32.705 --> 00:30:33.706
TONY: No, it's not for me, man.

690
00:30:33.873 --> 00:30:34.958
Oh. The plumber.

691
00:30:35.124 --> 00:30:36.292
What's he here for?

692
00:30:36.459 --> 00:30:38.127
What do you think? Terry.

693
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.879
Terry. Oh, Terry.

694
00:30:40.213 --> 00:30:43.466
Oh, no, wait. What's going on?
What is this man doing in my room?

695
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.801
This is...

696
00:30:45.134 --> 00:30:46.719
-Touissant.
-Touissant.

697
00:30:47.637 --> 00:30:49.055
Terry, Touissant.

698
00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:52.225
Well, I mean, I've taped my show...

699
00:30:52.392 --> 00:30:55.562
and then, well,
exactly how long is this going to take?

700
00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:58.523
Well, it shouldn't take more than a day.

701
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.067
TERRY: What accent is that, Joy?

702
00:31:01.234 --> 00:31:02.652
What country is that from?

703
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:04.320
TOUISSANT: Haiti.
JOY: Haiti.

704
00:31:04.487 --> 00:31:05.572
Haiti?

705
00:31:05.738 --> 00:31:07.198
It's French and Creole.

706
00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:09.576
French and Creole.

707
00:31:09.742 --> 00:31:12.412
Well, is there any way...
Could you please put a curtain up here...

708
00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:13.913
so that I can come and go in my room

709
00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:15.665
and watch my show
while he's still working?

710
00:31:15.832 --> 00:31:17.542
TOUISSANT: Of course. I have a stapler.

711
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:19.002
Thank you, sir.

712
00:31:19.168 --> 00:31:20.712
You're welcome, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

713
00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:22.005
<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

714
00:31:22.088 --> 00:31:23.339
(stapling sheet)

715
00:31:24.507 --> 00:31:27.427
Good luck in here
and good luck with the... that.

716
00:31:28.261 --> 00:31:29.721
RUDY: Why don't you go to bed?

717
00:31:31.097 --> 00:31:33.016
Keep going up the stairs.
Go to bed.

718
00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:36.227
I don't want to go to sleep.
I don't want to have that horrible dream.

719
00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:38.438
Come on! You can't have
the same dream twice.

720
00:31:38.521 --> 00:31:39.606
It never happens.

721
00:31:39.772 --> 00:31:42.025
-It's impossible.
-That's not true.

722
00:31:42.191 --> 00:31:44.444
I had the Peggy dream so many times
when I was younger...

723
00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:45.862
with the masks and the robe.

724
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:47.447
It doesn't make sense. No, no.

725
00:31:47.614 --> 00:31:50.033
You can't have the same dream twice.
Maybe it's the...

726
00:31:50.199 --> 00:31:51.451
MIMI: Rudy, she's thinking
about something.

727
00:31:51.618 --> 00:31:54.120
TONY: Maybe it's a good dream,
and she's working something out.

728
00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:57.624
I don't wanna work anything out.
I just want a nice, dumb sleep.

729
00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.293
Let's knock her out.
Give her a children's cough medicine.

730
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.753
-That's what does it.
-TONY: Is that safe?

731
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.129
MIMI: No. It's not safe.

732
00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:04.380
It's expired.

733
00:32:05.298 --> 00:32:07.467
Go on, there. Knock it back, honey.

734
00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:10.053
-MIMI: No.
-Okay, one more. Knock it down. Come on.

735
00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:11.804
-Rudy!
-Do it, Tony.

736
00:32:11.971 --> 00:32:13.556
-I don't know.
-Just do it. One more.

737
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.641
Okay, one more.

738
00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:17.143
Enough with this! That's it.
I'm gonna make her a hot toddy.

739
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:18.436
That's what she needs.

740
00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:19.646
TONY: You're gonna intoxicate her.

741
00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:22.482
RUDY: It's all natural, it's all herbal.
Nothing strong.

742
00:32:22.649 --> 00:32:28.947
I was kidnapped by another monk,
who was from Switzerland.

743
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:37.413
And it turned out that this monk
was a duke of a royal family.

744
00:32:38.581 --> 00:32:41.834
I shouldn't say "was," because he still is.

745
00:32:42.251 --> 00:32:43.753
Leave me alone.

746
00:32:44.754 --> 00:32:46.464
I don't think we should let her
sleep on the stairs.

747
00:32:47.173 --> 00:32:49.634
TONY: Let's put her here
on the couch, okay?

748
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.765
(hymn playing)

749
00:32:59.102 --> 00:33:00.186
(door closes)

750
00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:04.774
YOUNG JOY: Seventeen years.

751
00:33:04.941 --> 00:33:07.527
Think about it. We've been hiding...

752
00:33:07.694 --> 00:33:10.446
for seventeen years.

753
00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:13.700
Seventeen years.

754
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.662
We used to make things.
Seventeen years ago.

755
00:33:18.121 --> 00:33:20.498
Then, that all stopped.
What happened?

756
00:33:22.291 --> 00:33:25.378
When you're hiding, you're safe...

757
00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:28.548
because people can't see you.

758
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:31.843
But, funny thing about hiding...

759
00:33:32.218 --> 00:33:34.637
you're even hidden from yourself.

760
00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:49.694
Baby, what's the matter?

761
00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:50.820
(sighs)

762
00:33:50.903 --> 00:33:52.905
Tony, you need to move out
of the basement.

763
00:33:53.072 --> 00:33:54.657
You need to get your own house.

764
00:33:54.824 --> 00:33:56.242
What? Why?

765
00:33:56.826 --> 00:33:59.370
Because I go out at night
and sing at Angela's club?

766
00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:00.663
-Is that it?
-No.

767
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.082
Because we've been divorced
for two years.

768
00:34:03.249 --> 00:34:04.751
We need to move on.

769
00:34:04.917 --> 00:34:06.252
You need to move out.

770
00:34:07.086 --> 00:34:08.421
Rudy, you need to move out, too.

771
00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:09.756
RUDY: What?

772
00:34:09.922 --> 00:34:12.050
There's more room in the basement
for me now.

773
00:34:12.592 --> 00:34:13.676
JOY: And another thing, Rudy.

774
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.429
Tomorrow, I would like to have a meeting
with you and Trudy at your office...

775
00:34:16.512 --> 00:34:20.016
to discuss her investing
in the manufacturing of my new idea.

776
00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:21.184
No.

777
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.186
I'm still getting to know her
and falling in love.

778
00:34:23.352 --> 00:34:25.563
I can't do that. I won't do that.

779
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:28.441
And what manufacturing idea?
What are you talking about?

780
00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:33.237
I have always been there for you,
no matter what.

781
00:34:33.613 --> 00:34:34.781
I didn't go away to school.

782
00:34:34.947 --> 00:34:37.617
I stayed to help you and Mom
through the divorce and do your accounting.

783
00:34:38.117 --> 00:34:40.453
I let you live here whenever you want...

784
00:34:40.787 --> 00:34:42.705
no matter what it is.

785
00:34:43.456 --> 00:34:47.919
I am respectfully asking
for the favor that you owe me.

786
00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:52.048
If you look into your heart,
you'll know that I'm right.

787
00:34:56.636 --> 00:35:01.808
Cristy, I need to use your crayons,
your colored pencils and your paper.

788
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.102
Let's go to my room.

789
00:35:40.012 --> 00:35:41.180
JOY: You're not gonna believe this.

790
00:35:41.347 --> 00:35:43.474
So, you know that plumber
that you recommended?

791
00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:44.684
JACKIE: Yeah, Touissant.

792
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:48.437
So I hire him, Terry freaks out,
completely disoriented.

793
00:35:48.604 --> 00:35:51.149
Hasn't had a man in her room
for eight years, since Rudy.

794
00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:52.984
Makes me hang a drop cloth.

795
00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:54.152
The way I look at it...

796
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.613
is that this is an opportunity
for you to invest in a new business...

797
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.284
...that'll mean more money for you.

798
00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:04.537
Tell Rico, Dad. Number five's gotta go off.

799
00:36:04.704 --> 00:36:07.540
Rico, number five, no, off.

800
00:36:07.707 --> 00:36:09.876
(mouthing) Go off! Thank you!

801
00:36:11.043 --> 00:36:13.296
It's a standard handle, 53 inches.

802
00:36:13.462 --> 00:36:15.506
The sleeve connects to the mop head.

803
00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.800
Now, this is where it gets complicated.

804
00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:21.220
There's a clip
that connects the sleeve to the...

805
00:36:21.804 --> 00:36:24.348
I don't even know what to call it.
The "cup. "

806
00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:26.392
Which is connected to the mop head.

807
00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:29.979
So, when you pull up on the sleeve,
the mop head stretches...

808
00:36:30.062 --> 00:36:32.732
so you can wring it
without ever touching it with your hands.

809
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:36.235
The only thing we see
is this crayon drawings.

810
00:36:36.402 --> 00:36:37.820
We can't make heads or tails.

811
00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:39.822
We don't know what it is.

812
00:36:40.406 --> 00:36:43.576
So, the mop doesn't hang loose, like hair?
Like a string?

813
00:36:43.743 --> 00:36:45.870
It hangs, but not on loose,
open ends like hair.

814
00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:47.705
It's one continuous loop.

815
00:36:47.747 --> 00:36:48.873
-I don't get it.
-PEGGY: I don't get it.

816
00:36:48.915 --> 00:36:51.334
-I don't get it. What's he doing here?
-What's he doing here?

817
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.503
He is the father of our children,
and my friend, and he looks out for me.

818
00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:04.513
We're doing an invention.

819
00:37:04.931 --> 00:37:06.098
Cheers.

820
00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:07.767
Right.

821
00:37:09.852 --> 00:37:11.604
Yes we are, Cristy.

822
00:37:12.438 --> 00:37:14.232
It's very serious.

823
00:37:14.857 --> 00:37:16.400
It's priority.

824
00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:17.610
JOY: Yes it is.

825
00:37:17.777 --> 00:37:18.778
CRISTY: And I'm helping.

826
00:37:18.945 --> 00:37:20.613
JOY: Yes you are.

827
00:37:30.623 --> 00:37:32.625
<i>Ça se fait comme ça</i> in Haiti.

828
00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:35.086
Touissant is teaching me
how to speak French.

829
00:37:35.711 --> 00:37:37.630
And the word for "industrious" is...

830
00:37:38.214 --> 00:37:39.590
(speaks French)

831
00:37:39.715 --> 00:37:42.260
Yes. At first I thought
maybe something scary would happen...

832
00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:46.305
like what happened with Danica
while she was kidnapped by a man...

833
00:37:46.472 --> 00:37:49.100
who turned out to be in hiding
from the royal family in Switzerland...

834
00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:51.477
and then she moved to Switzerland.

835
00:37:51.644 --> 00:37:53.813
Of course, she befriended that man
and more.

836
00:37:54.313 --> 00:37:56.232
Don't ever try and limit me, Joy.

837
00:37:56.399 --> 00:37:58.401
And let me know if you want some
of this Chakalaka.

838
00:37:58.567 --> 00:37:59.568
Chaka. Say "chaka."

839
00:37:59.735 --> 00:38:01.404
-Chaka.
-It's very good.

840
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.491
(both saying goodbye in French)

841
00:38:06.158 --> 00:38:08.077
(hammering)

842
00:38:09.495 --> 00:38:11.247
Hey, Rocky. Hey, Tom!

843
00:38:12.915 --> 00:38:14.250
Take her inside the office.

844
00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:17.670
-Hey, Tino.
-Hey, Joy.

845
00:38:17.837 --> 00:38:19.672
I wanted to show you something.

846
00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:21.299
So, will you help me figure this out?

847
00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:24.510
I know that it has to be welded.
This part is supposed to twist.

848
00:38:51.037 --> 00:38:54.874
JOY: <i>1... 2... 3...</i>

849
00:38:55.207 --> 00:38:58.127
BOTH: 4, 5, 6...

850
00:38:58.711 --> 00:38:59.712
RUDY: What are you doing?

851
00:39:00.046 --> 00:39:01.464
(both continue counting)

852
00:39:05.551 --> 00:39:08.804
JOY: 38, 39, 40.

853
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.183
All right. All right, Dad,
come over here and grab this.

854
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:13.976
Grab it right in the middle.

855
00:39:18.564 --> 00:39:19.565
Okay. There.

856
00:39:19.732 --> 00:39:22.360
And go up, Jackie go down. You see it?

857
00:39:22.401 --> 00:39:23.486
Not yet.

858
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:25.571
All right. Here.

859
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.865
-How about now?
-No.

860
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.909
JOY: Well, you're going to.

861
00:39:30.076 --> 00:39:32.244
I don't see it yet, I mean...

862
00:39:36.582 --> 00:39:38.751
-You ready?
-Yeah.

863
00:39:40.336 --> 00:39:42.088
ALL: Oh!

864
00:39:45.758 --> 00:39:48.344
300 feet of continuous cotton loops.

865
00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:50.388
That's what I drew.

866
00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:55.518
This is why I would like to ask you
for your investment, Trudy.

867
00:39:56.769 --> 00:40:00.606
Morris worked 50 years
to earn his fortune, Joy.

868
00:40:01.565 --> 00:40:06.028
Before he passed on to the next world,
he made me promise on his deathbed...

869
00:40:06.195 --> 00:40:10.199
that I would never be neglectful
with one dollar of the money...

870
00:40:10.366 --> 00:40:12.451
that he so carefully earned.

871
00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:18.457
Therefore you have to answer Morris's
four questions of financial worthiness.

872
00:40:18.624 --> 00:40:19.750
Are you ready?

873
00:40:20.876 --> 00:40:22.253
I think so. Yes.

874
00:40:23.796 --> 00:40:25.464
Question number one:

875
00:40:26.215 --> 00:40:28.384
Where did you go to high school?

876
00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:30.094
Plainfield Public High.

877
00:40:30.219 --> 00:40:34.473
Question number two:
Who were you in high school?

878
00:40:35.224 --> 00:40:37.059
-I was valedictorian.
-Ah.

879
00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:40.187
The smartest student in the school.

880
00:40:40.354 --> 00:40:41.647
That's good, right?

881
00:40:42.565 --> 00:40:43.732
Perhaps.

882
00:40:44.316 --> 00:40:50.030
Joy might be a brilliant,
unrealized creator of commerce.

883
00:40:50.489 --> 00:40:51.490
But on the other hand...

884
00:40:51.657 --> 00:40:55.494
it's equally possible that she is
a fatally flawed underachiever...

885
00:40:55.661 --> 00:41:00.749
doomed to a lifetime of failure,
disappointment, unfulfilled expectations.

886
00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:03.461
You must admit, Joy...

887
00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:06.672
that your life, to date,
makes a stronger case for...

888
00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:09.008
...disappointment.

889
00:41:11.218 --> 00:41:12.595
I don't care about any of this.

890
00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:15.556
It's not only risky,
but it's fiscally irresponsible...

891
00:41:15.723 --> 00:41:18.058
and doesn't make any sense, whatsoever.

892
00:41:18.225 --> 00:41:19.560
Joy's never run a business in her life.

893
00:41:19.727 --> 00:41:22.062
I've been running my father's garage
for the last 10 years.

894
00:41:22.771 --> 00:41:24.356
Our father.

895
00:41:25.566 --> 00:41:27.902
I have ventures that I'm planning
to launch here...

896
00:41:28.068 --> 00:41:30.029
at this existing business.

897
00:41:30.196 --> 00:41:32.490
You never mentioned any of this...

898
00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:34.825
until I came to Trudy
to ask for an investment.

899
00:41:35.701 --> 00:41:37.995
What's Morris's third question?

900
00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.538
TRUDY: Are you prepared...

901
00:41:39.705 --> 00:41:43.083
within six months of commencing
this venture...

902
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.252
to show adequate returns?

903
00:41:46.086 --> 00:41:47.671
I accept your terms.

904
00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:49.215
Don't do it, Joy.

905
00:41:49.381 --> 00:41:51.217
What's the fourth question?

906
00:41:51.425 --> 00:41:55.804
You are in a room,
and there is a gun on the table.

907
00:41:55.971 --> 00:42:00.559
And the only other person in the room
is an adversary in commerce.

908
00:42:00.726 --> 00:42:02.978
Only one of you can prevail.

909
00:42:03.145 --> 00:42:08.901
Yet, you have protected your business
and Morris's money.

910
00:42:10.819 --> 00:42:13.030
Do you pick up the gun, Joy?

911
00:42:14.657 --> 00:42:16.784
That's a very strange question.

912
00:42:16.951 --> 00:42:20.829
There is nothing strange
about this question at all.

913
00:42:20.996 --> 00:42:22.915
This is money.

914
00:42:24.124 --> 00:42:27.920
Do you pick up the gun?

915
00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.339
I pick up the gun.

916
00:42:30.506 --> 00:42:31.632
Good.

917
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.010
I'm going to remember that you said that...

918
00:42:36.011 --> 00:42:38.472
when I speak to my lawyer.

919
00:42:39.515 --> 00:42:41.725
CRISTY: <i>What did Trudy's lawyer say?</i>

920
00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:43.852
He did a worldwide patent search.

921
00:42:44.019 --> 00:42:45.479
What's a patent?

922
00:42:46.355 --> 00:42:49.817
A patent is like a law
that you get to protect your idea.

923
00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:52.319
A lot of people patent their ideas...

924
00:42:52.486 --> 00:42:55.197
but only a few of them
actually get their ideas made.

925
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.950
So Trudy just wanted to be careful...

926
00:42:58.117 --> 00:42:59.326
TERRY: Joy...

927
00:42:59.493 --> 00:43:03.372
I just wanted to let you know that
Touissant has almost finished his work.

928
00:43:03.539 --> 00:43:04.873
And, um...

929
00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:06.208
(both chuckle)

930
00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:08.627
You know, we really need to find
some more work for him.

931
00:43:08.794 --> 00:43:11.046
-JOY: You want more work in the house?
-Yeah.

932
00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:12.923
I have another big job I have to go to.

933
00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:15.301
-What?
-Yes.

934
00:43:15.467 --> 00:43:17.595
-Well, but we have real issues here.
-Sorry.

935
00:43:18.053 --> 00:43:20.180
-We don't have money for that work, Mom.
-Well...

936
00:43:20.806 --> 00:43:21.807
Okay.

937
00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:24.518
Joy...

938
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.353
What is happening to you, Mother?

939
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.188
TERRY: I don't know what's going on.

940
00:43:28.355 --> 00:43:29.940
Are you in love with Touissant?

941
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.444
I was feeling alone.

942
00:43:34.903 --> 00:43:38.032
And I didn't even realize it, you know?

943
00:43:38.198 --> 00:43:39.366
And then...

944
00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:46.957
What did the patent search find?

945
00:43:48.208 --> 00:43:50.294
Trudy just wanted to be careful.

946
00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:53.213
And this guy found a man that's in Texas...

947
00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.966
who worked for another guy
in another country...

948
00:43:56.133 --> 00:44:00.971
where they have an idea
that might be similar to my mop.

949
00:44:01.138 --> 00:44:02.389
What country?

950
00:44:02.556 --> 00:44:03.557
Hong Kong.

951
00:44:04.016 --> 00:44:07.645
TRUDY: <i>The Hong Kong man</i>
<i>has a representative in Dallas, Texas.</i>

952
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:11.482
<i>The Dallas man was very reasonable</i>
<i>with my lawyer.</i>

953
00:44:12.775 --> 00:44:13.817
JOY: Hey.

954
00:44:20.866 --> 00:44:22.451
TONY: So, this guy in Texas...

955
00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:27.039
We're supposed to pay him a royalty
on the patent as a protection, right?

956
00:44:27.122 --> 00:44:28.123
Right.

957
00:44:28.207 --> 00:44:29.708
-To be safe from any claims.
-Yeah.

958
00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:30.876
Is that correct?

959
00:44:31.043 --> 00:44:33.045
Please stop using the word "we."

960
00:44:33.212 --> 00:44:35.506
None of this is your money
or your business.

961
00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:39.426
But the same guy
also owns a manufacturing plant...

962
00:44:39.593 --> 00:44:42.554
that you guys say that
it's cheaper than any other place?

963
00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:44.306
-Yes. In California.
-RUDY: Yes.

964
00:44:44.473 --> 00:44:46.850
A metal and plastic injection mold factory.

965
00:44:47.017 --> 00:44:48.519
Okay, so it's the same guy.
He owns the patent...

966
00:44:48.602 --> 00:44:49.812
This happens all the time in business.

967
00:44:49.978 --> 00:44:52.231
You find the best partner. It's smart.

968
00:44:52.398 --> 00:44:54.650
He doesn't understand business.
He doesn't know business.

969
00:44:54.817 --> 00:44:55.984
TONY: No, no, I'm the first to say that.

970
00:44:56.068 --> 00:44:57.111
PEGGY: I understand business.

971
00:44:57.277 --> 00:45:00.531
Dad and I, we buy parts for the trucks
all the time at the garage.

972
00:45:00.698 --> 00:45:02.366
TRUDY: Morris did it all the time.

973
00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.535
One-stop shopping. It's the cheapest.

974
00:45:04.576 --> 00:45:06.412
-TONY: But is that normal?
-That's how he made his money.

975
00:45:06.453 --> 00:45:07.496
-Yeah, that's normal.
-Yes!

976
00:45:07.663 --> 00:45:09.331
But is it normal, the same guy
who has the patent...

977
00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:11.041
is the same guy
who has the manufacturing?

978
00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:12.418
-Yeah. Make it best.
-Yeah.

979
00:45:12.584 --> 00:45:14.420
-Yeah?
-Better if it's that way.

980
00:45:14.586 --> 00:45:16.588
TONY: And the lawyer?
Right? Morris's lawyer?

981
00:45:16.672 --> 00:45:18.799
RUDY: He's good. Let's not make trouble.
TRUDY: He's very good.

982
00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:22.720
But he specialized in garment business, no?
Not manufacturing business.

983
00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:26.473
Tony. Let's quit while we're ahead.

984
00:45:28.642 --> 00:45:32.896
I know that you want
Tony to be your counselor, if you will...

985
00:45:33.063 --> 00:45:34.982
and I will respect that...

986
00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:39.486
as Tony and you should respect
what we're proposing...

987
00:45:39.653 --> 00:45:42.990
as the lawyer
for this whole business endeavor.

988
00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:50.664
JOY: All right.
The parts have arrived from California...

989
00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:53.083
and we can start manufacturing here.

990
00:45:53.625 --> 00:45:55.961
I have the first assembled mop.

991
00:45:56.628 --> 00:45:58.922
I told you it was gonna be more refined.

992
00:45:59.715 --> 00:46:00.924
And it is.

993
00:46:02.301 --> 00:46:03.302
PEGGY: Father Martinez is here.

994
00:46:03.469 --> 00:46:05.679
You need to set those women up right now
and get going.

995
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.890
They're gonna be so grateful
for the jobs, Joy.

996
00:46:08.056 --> 00:46:09.558
Okay. All right.
I'll go talk to those ladies.

997
00:46:09.725 --> 00:46:11.977
Now I finally have jobs for them.

998
00:46:14.897 --> 00:46:16.482
(all speaking Spanish)

999
00:46:43.926 --> 00:46:45.969
And I'll show you guys how to assemble...

1000
00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:48.263
(all speaking Spanish)

1001
00:47:08.867 --> 00:47:11.036
I'm a little proud of you.
I gotta admit it.

1002
00:47:12.246 --> 00:47:17.584
But, it costs much more than $15,000
to make the first run.

1003
00:47:17.751 --> 00:47:18.794
I know, Trudy.

1004
00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:21.129
But with all due respect,
that actually wasn't my fault.

1005
00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.465
RUDY: Look at this. More bills.

1006
00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:27.928
-What?
-TRUDY: Another bill from Gerhardt.

1007
00:47:28.095 --> 00:47:30.681
This guy keeps billing me
for his mistakes.

1008
00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:32.808
-TRUDY: That's business.
-No.

1009
00:47:32.975 --> 00:47:34.643
That's not the way I do business.

1010
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.311
I'm calling this guy.

1011
00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:43.652
Gerhardt, I'm not gonna
keep paying for these parts...

1012
00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:45.320
that it's taking you four times to get right.

1013
00:47:45.487 --> 00:47:48.365
GERHARDT: That was your design.
You have to pay for those parts.

1014
00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:51.285
That's mold-making.
That's the process.

1015
00:47:51.451 --> 00:47:53.704
My clients pay when we figure it out.

1016
00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:55.455
It was not my design, Gerhardt.

1017
00:47:55.622 --> 00:47:58.000
It was your mistake. I'm not paying it.

1018
00:47:58.166 --> 00:48:00.586
That was your design.
You have to pay.

1019
00:48:00.752 --> 00:48:02.588
TRUDY: Did you just hang up on him?

1020
00:48:02.754 --> 00:48:06.049
This guy was supposed to be easy
and inexpensive.

1021
00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:08.844
He keeps overbilling us.
I'm not paying for it.

1022
00:48:10.429 --> 00:48:12.681
Nobody pay it.

1023
00:48:12.848 --> 00:48:14.892
I'm gonna fight it out with this guy.

1024
00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:17.853
Just assemble them and try to sell them.

1025
00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:20.564
Just put it in your window.
Let your customers decide.

1026
00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:22.149
My family's been going to you
my whole life.

1027
00:48:22.316 --> 00:48:25.277
Look, the big companies,
they pay me for my shelf space.

1028
00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:28.196
Maybe you can sell one of your mops
to those big companies.

1029
00:48:28.363 --> 00:48:30.991
And maybe they'll put it on my shelf.

1030
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.538
JOY: <i>It's expensive, at $19.95,</i>
<i>but it's the only mop you'll ever have to buy.</i>

1031
00:48:36.705 --> 00:48:40.834
But I don't want people
to buy one mop for $20...

1032
00:48:41.001 --> 00:48:42.628
and never have to buy another mop again.

1033
00:48:42.794 --> 00:48:47.758
I'd rather they keep buying our mops at $5,
50 times, 100 times.

1034
00:48:48.634 --> 00:48:53.055
Look, you were broke and bored.
You had an idea.

1035
00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:55.390
So what? Lots of people have ideas.

1036
00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:58.518
Go home.
Please, take care of your family.

1037
00:48:59.645 --> 00:49:01.438
JOY: <i>Hi. Would you like to try a new mop?</i>

1038
00:49:02.064 --> 00:49:04.149
It's the only mop
you'll ever have to buy.

1039
00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:08.028
-Hi. Would you like to try a new mop?
-WOMAN 1: No.

1040
00:49:08.195 --> 00:49:09.404
It's self-wringing.

1041
00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:11.865
You can remove the mop head,
throw it in the washing machine.

1042
00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:13.075
-No germs.
-No.

1043
00:49:13.241 --> 00:49:14.576
No.

1044
00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:16.286
-No?
-WOMAN 2: Look at that.

1045
00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:18.372
You want to just try it?
You could just try.

1046
00:49:18.538 --> 00:49:21.667
It can self-wring. See?
No other mop does this.

1047
00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:24.795
(sighs)

1048
00:49:42.854 --> 00:49:45.315
Come and try the brand-new mop!

1049
00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:48.402
-It's the mop of the future.
-WOMAN 3: No, thanks.

1050
00:49:49.444 --> 00:49:50.696
JACKIE: Want to try this mop, ladies?

1051
00:49:50.862 --> 00:49:51.989
-What's this?
-Hey, miss.

1052
00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:53.407
It's a brand-new mop.

1053
00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:54.574
Oh.

1054
00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:56.493
You could wring it
without getting your hands dirty.

1055
00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:57.703
I don't think so.

1056
00:49:57.869 --> 00:50:00.747
Come on. Try it.
It's the mop of the future.

1057
00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:01.832
(exhales)

1058
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:04.543
-Self-wringing, huh?
-Yeah.

1059
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:07.004
All right. I do like the idea of that.

1060
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:11.008
I hate having to touch the mop head
after I get done cleaning the bathroom floor.

1061
00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:12.426
I always think that's disgusting,
you know?

1062
00:50:12.592 --> 00:50:13.635
WOMAN 4: It's so gross.

1063
00:50:13.802 --> 00:50:17.764
Wow. It really does get all the corners
that my sponge mop won't get.

1064
00:50:17.973 --> 00:50:21.143
All those crannies
where my kids spill their juice.

1065
00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.104
I really like it. Can we buy it?

1066
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:25.689
-Take it easy, Cristy.
-(women laugh)

1067
00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:29.026
Wow. I mean, that's just amazing.
You really don't have to touch it.

1068
00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:30.193
Look at that.

1069
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.570
You know what would make this perfect...

1070
00:50:31.737 --> 00:50:34.031
if you could remove the mop head,
put it in the washing machine...

1071
00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:35.866
-Really get it clean.
-WOMAN 5: That'd be great.

1072
00:50:36.616 --> 00:50:37.701
-You can.
-WOMAN 5: What?

1073
00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:38.869
Are you serious?

1074
00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:41.204
-Well how much is this mop?
-JACKIE: It's $19.95.

1075
00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:42.372
WOMAN 6: No, that's too much.

1076
00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:44.082
JOY: But I guess, I mean,
if it is the only mop

1077
00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:45.208
that you ever have to buy...

1078
00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:46.376
I mean we keep buying those
$5 mops.

1079
00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:47.753
-Hi, Daddy.
-TONY: Hi, sweetie.

1080
00:50:47.919 --> 00:50:52.841
You, you remember Angela?
And her two brothers, right?

1081
00:50:53.008 --> 00:50:54.676
I do. Hello.

1082
00:50:54.843 --> 00:50:56.553
-CRISTY: Mommy, the policeman.
-Ma'am?

1083
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.846
CRISTY: Did we break the law?

1084
00:50:58.013 --> 00:51:00.223
-I'm taking this merchandise.
-No, no. We're leaving. We're leaving.

1085
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:01.975
Now, I'm gonna let you off with a warning.

1086
00:51:02.142 --> 00:51:03.435
We were just leaving. No. Sir...

1087
00:51:03.602 --> 00:51:05.312
If the customers can just see
what the mop can do...

1088
00:51:05.437 --> 00:51:07.105
But if I catch you out here again,
you will be prosecuted!

1089
00:51:07.272 --> 00:51:08.356
Well, where do I go?
Sir, please!

1090
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.441
You cannot sell on Kmart property!

1091
00:51:09.524 --> 00:51:11.026
I made those mops myself.
I paid for them. Please.

1092
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:12.319
JACKIE: It took a lot of work.

1093
00:51:12.402 --> 00:51:13.445
-I won't come back,
-(Cristy sobbing)

1094
00:51:13.528 --> 00:51:14.571
but you don't have to take my stuff!

1095
00:51:14.654 --> 00:51:15.697
Please!

1096
00:51:15.864 --> 00:51:18.075
-Are you even allowed to do this?
-How embarrassing for you...

1097
00:51:18.158 --> 00:51:19.618
to be seen here like this
with your daughter.

1098
00:51:19.701 --> 00:51:21.870
-What kind of parent are you, huh?
-MAN: Yeah, Tony.

1099
00:51:21.953 --> 00:51:22.996
-TONY: Enough.
-Hey.

1100
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.122
TONY: Hey, hey, guys. Guys...

1101
00:51:24.206 --> 00:51:25.248
MAN 1: All right.
MAN 2: Come on.

1102
00:51:25.332 --> 00:51:26.541
-Let's go.
-Tony, let's go.

1103
00:51:26.708 --> 00:51:28.293
Yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming.

1104
00:51:38.178 --> 00:51:39.221
(Cristy crying)

1105
00:51:39.304 --> 00:51:42.140
JACKIE: Cristy, honey, it's okay.
Your mommy's okay.

1106
00:51:44.017 --> 00:51:45.102
(grunts)

1107
00:51:45.685 --> 00:51:48.855
This stupid thing.
This place is falling apart!

1108
00:51:49.022 --> 00:51:50.607
No... No.

1109
00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:54.528
TERRY: Honey, the telephone isn't working.

1110
00:51:54.694 --> 00:51:56.071
I know. I just got the notice.

1111
00:51:56.238 --> 00:51:59.449
I had to go next door to use the phone.
Tommy's got a fever.

1112
00:51:59.616 --> 00:52:00.617
Tommy has a fever?

1113
00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.578
Simple cold with a cough.
It's going around. All the kids have it.

1114
00:52:03.745 --> 00:52:05.122
Thank God the heat's still working.

1115
00:52:05.288 --> 00:52:07.457
Mommy, why isn't the phone working?

1116
00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:09.126
Because I'm late on paying the bill.

1117
00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:10.252
(Cristy coughing)

1118
00:52:10.335 --> 00:52:11.920
-Are we gonna lose our house?
-Not you too.

1119
00:52:12.087 --> 00:52:13.672
No, we're not gonna lose our house.

1120
00:52:14.756 --> 00:52:16.216
Come on. Get upstairs. Get in the bath.

1121
00:52:16.383 --> 00:52:17.717
Listen to your mom and get
right in that tub.

1122
00:52:17.884 --> 00:52:19.553
-I don't want a hot bath.
-I don't care.

1123
00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:21.847
Cristy, you get in that hot bath.
Listen to your mother.

1124
00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:23.849
I don't want you getting sick too.

1125
00:52:24.516 --> 00:52:28.186
Lauren Wells said you're a cleaning lady
and sell used mops.

1126
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:29.312
(sighs)

1127
00:52:29.855 --> 00:52:31.565
Lauren Wells said that?

1128
00:52:32.607 --> 00:52:35.318
Yeah. And it really hurt my feelings.

1129
00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:39.239
First of all, even if I was
a cleaning lady, so what?

1130
00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:41.199
There's no shame in hard work.

1131
00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:44.411
And second of all, you know, I'm...

1132
00:52:46.079 --> 00:52:49.624
I'm trying to sell a new mop,
not used mops.

1133
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:55.463
And third of all,
don't take any guff from anybody.

1134
00:52:55.964 --> 00:52:59.176
You know, don't let it in.

1135
00:52:59.926 --> 00:53:02.971
I know it's hard.
And I'm sorry that happened.

1136
00:53:04.598 --> 00:53:05.891
Now get in the bath.

1137
00:53:09.728 --> 00:53:11.646
(Tommy coughing)

1138
00:53:12.647 --> 00:53:13.690
JOY: Oh...

1139
00:53:13.773 --> 00:53:15.567
Come on. Go to sleep, honey.

1140
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:17.068
(kisses)

1141
00:53:21.281 --> 00:53:22.574
(sighs)

1142
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.166
Joy?

1143
00:53:31.458 --> 00:53:32.792
Not now, Mimi.

1144
00:53:32.959 --> 00:53:35.879
Joy, wait, wait.
Just tell me what happened today.

1145
00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:38.423
I want to know how it went.
Please, I want to know.

1146
00:53:40.675 --> 00:53:42.093
It was a disaster.

1147
00:53:43.011 --> 00:53:44.095
But you must never give up.

1148
00:53:44.262 --> 00:53:45.847
Ever since you were little,
you were born to bear...

1149
00:53:46.014 --> 00:53:48.266
Born to bear what, Mimi?

1150
00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.561
Failure? Disgrace?

1151
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:55.023
Humiliation in front of my daughter?

1152
00:53:55.815 --> 00:53:59.819
You were born to be
the unanxious presence in the room.

1153
00:53:59.986 --> 00:54:02.864
And I know that I'm gonna live
to see you grow...

1154
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:06.284
to be the successful matriarch
that you were born to be.

1155
00:54:06.451 --> 00:54:07.494
-Matriarch...
-(doorbell rings)

1156
00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:09.996
To be a mother with courage.

1157
00:54:10.163 --> 00:54:12.040
Who can't even support her children.

1158
00:54:12.457 --> 00:54:13.541
MIMI: Sweetheart.

1159
00:54:17.504 --> 00:54:19.339
What are you doing here?

1160
00:54:19.506 --> 00:54:21.132
TONY: I have this idea.

1161
00:54:21.299 --> 00:54:22.884
-A guy I know.
-What guy?

1162
00:54:23.051 --> 00:54:28.056
He used to work with me.
And now he works at this big retailer.

1163
00:54:28.223 --> 00:54:30.433
A new way of doing business.

1164
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.394
I mean, it's worth a try.

1165
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.689
You would do that for me?

1166
00:54:35.855 --> 00:54:36.982
Of course.

1167
00:54:37.148 --> 00:54:39.609
MIMI: <i>They were the best divorced couple</i>
<i>in America.</i>

1168
00:54:40.568 --> 00:54:43.280
<i>Much better friends than</i>
<i>they were husband and wife.</i>

1169
00:54:44.197 --> 00:54:45.740
I can get you a meeting with him.

1170
00:54:48.201 --> 00:54:49.536
Where is it?

1171
00:54:52.831 --> 00:54:55.250
JOY: But I don't understand
what we're doing in Amish country.

1172
00:54:55.333 --> 00:54:58.044
They don't even have electricity out here.
How could they sell anything on TV?

1173
00:54:58.128 --> 00:55:00.422
It has nothing to do with Amish people.

1174
00:55:00.547 --> 00:55:03.008
It just happens to be located here.
I looked it up.

1175
00:55:03.174 --> 00:55:04.759
In Amish country.

1176
00:55:04.926 --> 00:55:06.636
-Amish.
-What?

1177
00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:08.805
-Amish.
-Amish.

1178
00:55:20.859 --> 00:55:22.193
Sign in, please.

1179
00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:26.656
We're here to see Marv Brickman.

1180
00:55:27.282 --> 00:55:28.450
Okay.

1181
00:55:28.616 --> 00:55:32.162
Marv Brickman, does he know who you are
if I call his office?

1182
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:33.872
Of course he knows.

1183
00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:35.749
We're friends. We used to work together.

1184
00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:37.459
(phone ringing)

1185
00:55:37.542 --> 00:55:39.169
RECEPTIONIST: QVC, please hold.

1186
00:55:48.345 --> 00:55:50.347
-(door opens)
-(men laughing)

1187
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.974
MAN: But Tom was wrong about that.
He was wrong about the numbers...

1188
00:55:57.145 --> 00:55:58.229
MARV: Tony.

1189
00:55:58.396 --> 00:55:59.564
TONY: Marv. How are you?

1190
00:55:59.731 --> 00:56:01.107
MARV: I can't see you today.

1191
00:56:01.274 --> 00:56:02.525
TONY: Why?

1192
00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:04.569
MARV: Maybe tomorrow
if you can stay in town.

1193
00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:07.030
TONY: No, we left the kids at home.
We can't.

1194
00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:08.990
We can't stay until tomorrow.

1195
00:56:09.157 --> 00:56:12.118
MARV: Listen, you can't just expect
to come in here and see someone.

1196
00:56:12.285 --> 00:56:13.787
NEIL: Hey, did you take care
of that advertising thing?

1197
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.789
MARV: Yes, I did.
NEIL: Good. All right.

1198
00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:16.915
What's going on here?

1199
00:56:16.998 --> 00:56:19.167
MARV: This is my good friend, Tony.
TONY: Tony Miranda.

1200
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:20.377
MARV: We worked together at Campbell's.

1201
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:21.503
NEIL: Neil Walker.

1202
00:56:21.586 --> 00:56:23.129
MARV: And this is his ex-wife.
NEIL: Good to meet you.

1203
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.589
-Joy.
-Hi. Neil.

1204
00:56:24.756 --> 00:56:25.799
MARV: She's an inventor.

1205
00:56:25.965 --> 00:56:27.300
She wanted two minutes
of your time today,

1206
00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:28.968
but, Neil, don't worry about this.

1207
00:56:29.135 --> 00:56:30.428
-Maybe tomorrow.
-NEIL: You know what?

1208
00:56:30.595 --> 00:56:33.223
Why don't you come in for five minutes
while the sales group's still here.

1209
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:34.808
-Okay. Hold my bag.
-MARV: Neil, are you sure?

1210
00:56:34.974 --> 00:56:36.184
TONY: Yeah.
NEIL: Yeah, absolutely.

1211
00:56:36.351 --> 00:56:37.602
TONY: Thank you.

1212
00:56:37.769 --> 00:56:38.812
NEIL: Got everything?
JOY: Yeah.

1213
00:56:38.978 --> 00:56:40.438
Great. Thank you, man.

1214
00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:42.565
Thank you.

1215
00:56:50.657 --> 00:56:52.325
So tell us your name, please.

1216
00:56:56.121 --> 00:56:57.247
I'm Joy.

1217
00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:01.251
And what would you like
to show us today?

1218
00:57:01.418 --> 00:57:03.503
I have a self-wringing mop.

1219
00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:04.712
Mmm.

1220
00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:07.048
-Just...
-Do you need some help?

1221
00:57:07.215 --> 00:57:08.383
-JOY: No. No, no.
-(water splashing)

1222
00:57:08.883 --> 00:57:10.301
-All right.
-(water spills)

1223
00:57:11.052 --> 00:57:12.846
-MAN: Uh, that's my shoe.
-(people laughing)

1224
00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:14.764
JOY: Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry, sir.

1225
00:57:17.016 --> 00:57:18.435
MAN: Sock's wet.

1226
00:57:18.601 --> 00:57:19.769
JOY: Do you mind?

1227
00:57:20.979 --> 00:57:22.021
Sorry.

1228
00:57:25.733 --> 00:57:26.818
Is that plastic?

1229
00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:28.027
JOY: Yes.

1230
00:57:28.153 --> 00:57:30.029
Arnold, why don't you give it a try?
Is that okay?

1231
00:57:30.196 --> 00:57:31.364
JOY: Yes, of course.

1232
00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:33.116
-Just dunk it.
-(man laughing)

1233
00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:34.784
-I dip it?
-Yes.

1234
00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:37.454
And then I... twist it?

1235
00:57:37.495 --> 00:57:38.580
JOY: But you pull...
You have to pull it first.

1236
00:57:38.663 --> 00:57:39.706
-Pull it and twist it.
-(all laughing)

1237
00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:40.874
You got to pull it first before you twist it.

1238
00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:42.000
-I'm pulling it and...
-Pull and twist.

1239
00:57:42.083 --> 00:57:43.126
...and I am twisting it.

1240
00:57:43.877 --> 00:57:45.420
MAN: Pull and twist,
just like when you're on the road.

1241
00:57:45.628 --> 00:57:47.255
(all laughing)

1242
00:57:47.755 --> 00:57:51.259
We don't mean to be disrespectful, Joy.
It's the end of a long day for us.

1243
00:57:52.594 --> 00:57:55.889
I feel like I want to tell you
a little bit about who I am.

1244
00:57:56.055 --> 00:57:59.350
Because I have a feeling you don't know
exactly where you are right now.

1245
00:57:59.434 --> 00:58:00.477
Am I right?

1246
00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:03.480
Ten months ago...

1247
00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:07.150
a man named Barry Diller
called me from Los Angeles.

1248
00:58:08.067 --> 00:58:12.030
He started a television network.
Fox television channel.

1249
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:16.784
And prior to that, he ran 20th Century Fox,
among other studios.

1250
00:58:17.452 --> 00:58:20.079
And he acquired a little cable channel...

1251
00:58:20.246 --> 00:58:22.665
right here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

1252
00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:24.792
And he hired me to run it...

1253
00:58:25.502 --> 00:58:27.587
as a bigger idea.

1254
00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:31.758
Now, I'm from Detroit, Michigan.

1255
00:58:33.218 --> 00:58:37.639
I ran America's largest, most affordable...

1256
00:58:37.805 --> 00:58:40.642
successful, value-driven retailer.

1257
00:58:40.808 --> 00:58:42.602
Chain called Kmart.

1258
00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:46.064
Prior to that, I was a buyer for Kmart.

1259
00:58:46.731 --> 00:58:51.194
And prior to that,
I managed seven separate Kmart stores.

1260
00:58:51.653 --> 00:58:54.906
I decide what products
we let into our stores here...

1261
00:58:55.073 --> 00:59:00.078
into people's homes, 24 hours a day,
for our valued customers.

1262
00:59:01.329 --> 00:59:05.291
I choose very carefully
and very conservatively.

1263
00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:10.421
I spend most of my day deflecting
incoming shots from people like yourself.

1264
00:59:13.132 --> 00:59:14.175
You see that chart?

1265
00:59:20.848 --> 00:59:24.894
This green line either rises
or stays the same each month.

1266
00:59:25.812 --> 00:59:28.565
There's no problem
with my product choice.

1267
00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:32.694
Do you know what QVC stands for, Joy?

1268
00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:35.738
No, I don't.

1269
00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:39.867
Quality, Value, Convenience.

1270
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:44.831
I sell product affordably,
but I don't sell cheap product.

1271
00:59:44.998 --> 00:59:47.417
And your mop is plastic
and it looks strange.

1272
00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:52.338
I don't know anything about charts.

1273
00:59:52.505 --> 00:59:53.548
Or...

1274
00:59:55.216 --> 00:59:56.968
...business, frankly.

1275
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.762
But I do clean my own home.

1276
01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:02.765
And I made this mop...

1277
01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:06.102
because it is better
than anything else out there.

1278
01:00:09.355 --> 01:00:10.982
Please give me a chance.

1279
01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:14.611
I like that it's plastic...

1280
01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:17.739
because it's so light in my hands,
it's like nothing.

1281
01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:21.659
It's also ten times more absorbent
than any other mop on the market.

1282
01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:22.827
Why?

1283
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:28.499
Because of 300 feet of continuous
cotton loop that I looped myself.

1284
01:00:28.666 --> 01:00:31.377
That is an enormous amount
of absorbent cotton...

1285
01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:33.254
on a very small mop head.

1286
01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:36.883
Now I'm done with the bathroom,
and I haven't wrung the mop once.

1287
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.676
Let me ask you a question.

1288
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:40.845
Would you take this mop...

1289
01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:42.305
where you were
just cleaning the bathroom...

1290
01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:44.390
and around the toilet,
and all of those germs...

1291
01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:46.934
and take it into the kitchen...

1292
01:00:47.101 --> 01:00:49.562
where your family eats,
where you feed your children?

1293
01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:53.775
I take this mop head,
I put it in the washing machine...

1294
01:00:53.941 --> 01:00:55.568
it comes out clean like new.

1295
01:00:56.611 --> 01:01:00.073
You can't do that with any other mop.

1296
01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:02.033
-So...
-Stop.

1297
01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:09.374
Can you make 50,000
of these mops by next week?

1298
01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.211
Yeah, I think so.

1299
01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:17.632
NEIL: David Selznick,
the son of immigrants...

1300
01:01:17.882 --> 01:01:20.927
married Jennifer Jones from Oklahoma,
America's sweetheart.

1301
01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:23.304
That just goes to show you
that in America...

1302
01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:27.225
the ordinary meets the extraordinary
every single day.

1303
01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:29.560
Thomas. Where are you going with that?

1304
01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:31.270
The skinny pants you wanted.

1305
01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:33.981
NEIL: I never said "skinny pants."
I said, "stovepipe." Classic look.

1306
01:01:34.148 --> 01:01:35.483
(stammers) I heard "skinny pants."

1307
01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:37.819
You know how much I love the stovepipe.

1308
01:01:37.985 --> 01:01:39.737
-Stovepipe. Classic. Got it.
-Got it.

1309
01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:41.614
-Fine, we'll go for stovepipe.
-Thank you.

1310
01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:47.078
See those guys? I told them so many times
and they still don't understand.

1311
01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:48.996
A very smart guy once said...

1312
01:01:49.163 --> 01:01:50.832
"You tell somebody something
once, they don't listen.

1313
01:01:50.915 --> 01:01:52.458
"You tell somebody four times,
they don't listen.

1314
01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:55.628
"By the ninth time you say it,
they begin to hear you."

1315
01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:57.588
That's why we're on 24 hours a day.

1316
01:01:57.755 --> 01:02:00.174
That's why, with the people who I have
to tell about the stovepipe.

1317
01:02:01.592 --> 01:02:03.094
Music in the makeup rooms?

1318
01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:04.595
Yeah, I thought it'd
give a sense of place, Todd.

1319
01:02:04.762 --> 01:02:06.973
But if you don't want it,
you can always turn it down.

1320
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.182
You're our biggest seller, Todd.

1321
01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:10.435
Whatever you need
to make you comfortable.

1322
01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:12.061
You're who we care about.
You're our number-one seller.

1323
01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:13.312
-CINDY: What?
-Oh, no.

1324
01:02:14.188 --> 01:02:15.606
He's your number-one seller?

1325
01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:18.943
No, no, no. Cindy, please.
You know that we love you.

1326
01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:21.028
-(door slams)
-Oh, for heaven sake.

1327
01:02:21.362 --> 01:02:25.450
She's never had a professional attitude.
Clearly, she's jealous.

1328
01:02:25.783 --> 01:02:27.618
But could you do me a favor?
Make her your friend.

1329
01:02:27.785 --> 01:02:30.997
Could you just do me that favor, Todd?
Please?

1330
01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.165
For me?

1331
01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:34.125
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

1332
01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.127
This is Joy. She has
a very exciting new mop

1333
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:37.462
that we're gonna introduce next week.

1334
01:02:37.795 --> 01:02:39.797
I would like you to launch it.
You're my first choice.

1335
01:02:39.964 --> 01:02:41.215
A mop?

1336
01:02:41.382 --> 01:02:44.886
You want me to bring this
newborn into the world?

1337
01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:51.225
That newborn that you're holding is
every cent, every dollar, even debt...

1338
01:02:51.392 --> 01:02:52.393
that I've ever made.

1339
01:02:52.977 --> 01:02:54.312
Every cent you've ever made?

1340
01:02:54.645 --> 01:02:55.646
That's right.

1341
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.815
That kind of pressure is not helpful.

1342
01:02:58.191 --> 01:02:59.650
-What?
-No.

1343
01:02:59.817 --> 01:03:01.986
It's not part of my process, either.

1344
01:03:02.403 --> 01:03:03.571
Oh.

1345
01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:07.241
-NEIL: Todd...
-I didn't mean to pressure you, Todd.

1346
01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.412
-NEIL: Performers can be finicky creatures.
-He's very sensitive.

1347
01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:14.999
He is our number-one seller.
He is selling everything through the roof

1348
01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:17.376
in numbers we've never seen before.

1349
01:03:17.835 --> 01:03:18.920
I take it very seriously.

1350
01:03:19.086 --> 01:03:21.172
I see it as a privilege that we have
to go into people's homes.

1351
01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:23.007
And I despise anybody
who's cynical about that.

1352
01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:26.511
Jack Warner wasn't cynical about that.
Darryl Zanuck wasn't cynical about that.

1353
01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:28.346
And Neil Walker is not cynical about that.

1354
01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:30.389
Let me show you the stage.

1355
01:03:31.682 --> 01:03:33.601
I believe eventually, one day...

1356
01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:38.606
television will even be
by and about actual regular people.

1357
01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:42.026
Maybe even on computers,
24 hours a day.

1358
01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:44.737
Who knows?
Nobody thought this network would be real.

1359
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.698
-And here we are.
-(rumbling)

1360
01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:50.076
-By the way, stock's going through the roof.
-What...?

1361
01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:52.370
(dog barking)

1362
01:03:52.453 --> 01:03:53.913
Must be mindful of Joan's dog.

1363
01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.915
Who's... Oh.

1364
01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.208
-Who's Joan?
-(gasps)

1365
01:03:58.042 --> 01:04:00.294
Thank you, darling.

1366
01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:04.090
Oh, you're never gonna make it
in a man's world dressed like that.

1367
01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:06.717
Oh, Mr. Peepers, you were
almost a Peepers pancake.

1368
01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:10.555
NEIL: It's a round stage that has four
or five different sets that rotate...

1369
01:04:10.721 --> 01:04:13.391
depending on what we're selling
at a given moment.

1370
01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:14.809
JOAN: The clasp is part
of the necklace. See?

1371
01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:17.603
Look at the quality in this glass.
That's what we do.

1372
01:04:17.728 --> 01:04:19.063
CINDY: Absolutely exquisite.

1373
01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:22.316
Here comes Joan and Cindy.
Watch this.

1374
01:04:23.067 --> 01:04:24.235
These guys are major.

1375
01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:25.903
Joan's the original seller.

1376
01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:27.738
JOAN: If you're just starting
your jewelry wardrobe,

1377
01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:29.240
can you do anything better than this?

1378
01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:31.909
You're gonna mix in your blacks,
your golds, your pearls.

1379
01:04:32.076 --> 01:04:33.077
-Everything.
-Everything.

1380
01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:34.412
Look at it against the peach. Okay?

1381
01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:36.080
-Look at that.
-Morning.

1382
01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:37.665
-Look at that.
-Green. Afternoon.

1383
01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.292
-Look. Black, night.
-Black, evening.

1384
01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:41.669
-Of course at night.
-I mean, can you be more elegant?

1385
01:04:41.836 --> 01:04:44.005
So it's functional. Elegant.

1386
01:04:44.171 --> 01:04:46.757
You can wear it alone.
You can wear it... What I love...

1387
01:04:46.924 --> 01:04:48.926
See. Stars and people,
they always make the mistake.

1388
01:04:49.093 --> 01:04:51.012
They think it's about the face,
but it's not.

1389
01:04:51.178 --> 01:04:52.597
It's about the hands.

1390
01:04:52.763 --> 01:04:54.098
Because that's what people use.

1391
01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:55.933
They hold things they care about.

1392
01:04:56.017 --> 01:04:58.436
And her hands are gonna become
their hands.

1393
01:04:58.603 --> 01:04:59.770
And that becomes them.

1394
01:04:59.937 --> 01:05:02.273
And then their voice,
and then their eyes.

1395
01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.983
Stars always make the mistake.

1396
01:05:04.358 --> 01:05:07.486
It's really about the hands and the voice.
That's the heart of it.

1397
01:05:08.362 --> 01:05:10.615
Number J-6276.

1398
01:05:10.948 --> 01:05:12.199
A $100 value.

1399
01:05:12.366 --> 01:05:13.784
Are they not phenomenal?

1400
01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:16.120
-Now watch this.
-CINDY: These can be yours.

1401
01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:18.831
Cindy's gonna lay this down right...

1402
01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:20.124
CINDY: $39.99.

1403
01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:21.459
...now!

1404
01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:23.961
You need this. You can get this.

1405
01:05:24.128 --> 01:05:25.630
You need to call right now, though.

1406
01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.298
I'm being told we have limited quantity left.

1407
01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.466
NEIL: Watch the calls come in.

1408
01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:30.301
Watch them. Here they come.

1409
01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:32.887
CINDY: For $39.99,
you might as well get several.

1410
01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:35.222
-Calls coming in now.
-(indistinct chattering)

1411
01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:37.058
Calls. Calls.

1412
01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:40.394
Calls. Calls. Calls. Calls.

1413
01:05:40.561 --> 01:05:42.647
Look at the count.
I guarantee we're gonna go over twenty.

1414
01:05:42.813 --> 01:05:44.482
Those are FTC standards.
Those are legal.

1415
01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:46.984
Those are coming in. Keep your eyes...
Those are actual sales, Joy.

1416
01:05:47.151 --> 01:05:48.361
Lines are busy?

1417
01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:49.987
-Is the queue full?
-MAN: Queue's full.

1418
01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:52.239
Okay. We need a phone call right now.

1419
01:05:52.406 --> 01:05:54.408
When they can't call through,
we gotta keep them watching.

1420
01:05:54.575 --> 01:05:56.077
Did we get a call? Did we get a call?

1421
01:05:56.243 --> 01:05:57.328
Okay. Got it.

1422
01:05:57.495 --> 01:05:58.829
Keep this going. Phone call right now.

1423
01:05:58.913 --> 01:05:59.997
CINDY: Wait, wait, wait!
We have a caller!

1424
01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:01.040
We have a caller!

1425
01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:03.417
Ah, Sharon from Colorado. Hi, Sharon.

1426
01:06:03.584 --> 01:06:04.585
JOAN: Hi, Sharon.

1427
01:06:04.669 --> 01:06:06.963
SHARON (on phone): Cindy and Joan!
I can't believe I'm talking to you!

1428
01:06:07.546 --> 01:06:09.340
CINDY: Are you happy with your necklace?

1429
01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:13.844
SHARON: These necklaces
are so gorgeous and timeless.

1430
01:06:14.011 --> 01:06:15.012
My great-grandmother had things like this.

1431
01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:16.180
Yes, yes. Keep it going.

1432
01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:19.350
I am so excited to have these.

1433
01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:22.728
NEIL: Keep it going. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1434
01:06:22.853 --> 01:06:25.022
CINDY: Get one for your mother.
Get one for your sister.

1435
01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:26.357
NEIL: Watch the counter, Joy. Joy.

1436
01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:28.943
JOAN: You will not regret owning this.
CINDY: No, you will not.

1437
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.277
See those numbers?

1438
01:06:30.444 --> 01:06:32.196
We're gonna wind up at 25,000.

1439
01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:34.865
Cindy knows how to close it.

1440
01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:36.200
Wow.

1441
01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:39.078
Okay, I want you to go home,
I want you to call your lawyer.

1442
01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:40.538
Look at your contract.

1443
01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:43.124
Make sure your product factory
is in line.

1444
01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:46.210
-Okay?
-Okay.

1445
01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:49.213
Okay, Godspeed, good luck.
Here we go. I'll walk you out.

1446
01:06:52.216 --> 01:06:54.051
RUDY: You can't expect Trudy
to write a check

1447
01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:57.054
for $200,000 for 50,000 mops...

1448
01:06:57.471 --> 01:07:01.392
when you already owe her $18,000
to make mops you haven't even sold yet.

1449
01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:08.899
Do you understand that there is a business
that wants to sell my mop on television?

1450
01:07:09.066 --> 01:07:10.735
It's going to sell.

1451
01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:14.989
RUDY: Fine. You feel so strongly about it,
you put up half the money.

1452
01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:18.617
Yes. It's only fair that you share
the financial risk, too.

1453
01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:22.246
How's she gonna do that?
She's got nothing. She's got no money.

1454
01:07:24.248 --> 01:07:26.917
What, do you want me to take out
a second mortgage on my house?

1455
01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:34.258
They want me to take out
a second mortgage on my house.

1456
01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:35.926
A second mortgage?

1457
01:07:36.093 --> 01:07:37.428
JACKIE: But the house, the kids, Joy.

1458
01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:39.597
TONY: What's gonna happen, Joy?
How would you do that?

1459
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.765
JOY: I don't know.

1460
01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:43.267
MAN:
<i>♪ A little less conversation♪</i>

1461
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:45.102
<i>♪ A little more action, please ♪</i>

1462
01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:49.023
<i>♪ All this aggravation</i>

1463
01:07:49.982 --> 01:07:52.151

1464
01:07:52.276 --> 01:07:54.028

1465
01:07:54.111 --> 01:07:55.488
<i>♪ Close your mouth and open up your heart... ♪</i>

1466
01:07:55.613 --> 01:07:57.156
-Hey. How you doing?
-Hey.

1467
01:07:57.281 --> 01:07:58.574
You know I've been
watching you through that fence

1468
01:07:58.616 --> 01:07:59.992
-since you were a little girl?
-Yeah.

1469
01:08:00.117 --> 01:08:01.452
I've been watching you grow up.

1470
01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:02.620
-Hey, listen.
-What?

1471
01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:04.789
You think it would be okay if I...

1472
01:08:04.955 --> 01:08:06.624
-You wanna fire a few rounds?
-I do.

1473
01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:07.833
Yeah. Might make you feel better.

1474
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.001
Thank you. I think it will.

1475
01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:10.628
-You know how to hold it?
-Yeah.

1476
01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:12.963
Okay. Sure.

1477
01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:15.633
(glass shattering)

1478
01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:16.884
Good.

1479
01:08:17.134 --> 01:08:18.219
Good.

1480
01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:20.805
Good.

1481
01:08:20.888 --> 01:08:21.889
Good.

1482
01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:26.310
(sighs)

1483
01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:30.397
(exhales)

1484
01:08:38.155 --> 01:08:40.825
This is it! Oh, my gosh.

1485
01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:44.662
TODD (on TV): Get ready. This is definitely
gonna change the holidays...

1486
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:47.665
for anyone who has a floor
or a bathroom...

1487
01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:50.835
because we have the most exciting
new home product in years.

1488
01:08:51.168 --> 01:08:52.169
-TONY: Yeah!
-(all cheering)

1489
01:08:52.336 --> 01:08:55.589
This is the new self-wringing mop.

1490
01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:56.757
Okay, okay, okay!

1491
01:08:56.924 --> 01:08:59.677
It's the new standard in homes,
right here.

1492
01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:02.847
Let's take a look at this.
This is brought to you only by QVC.

1493
01:09:03.013 --> 01:09:08.561
Now, this is clearly extremely
soft and absorbent cotton.

1494
01:09:09.353 --> 01:09:10.521
There we go.

1495
01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:14.024
You just take this, and you, uh...

1496
01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:15.693
start...

1497
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:17.945
I'm not sure.
This is a little trickier than it looks.

1498
01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:20.030
Put it...

1499
01:09:20.906 --> 01:09:23.367
Well, it's getting my arm wet, here.

1500
01:09:24.034 --> 01:09:26.203
Uh, let's see. We got no sales here.

1501
01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:27.913
What happened?

1502
01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.290
Is there a call?

1503
01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:33.127
So there... So there are no calls.

1504
01:09:34.753 --> 01:09:35.754
All right.

1505
01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:42.595
And we do not have any sales still
so here's what we're gonna do. Um...

1506
01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:45.181
We're gonna move on.
Now, we're gonna move on.

1507
01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:50.394
Cindy is gonna talk to Sarina Kimball,
former star from <i>Falcon Crest</i> and <i>Dynasty...</i>

1508
01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:55.065
and she is gonna tell us,
uh, all about her new line of gowns.

1509
01:09:55.482 --> 01:09:59.403
These are my special occasion gowns...

1510
01:09:59.486 --> 01:10:01.739
Uh... "Special." How apropos.

1511
01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:08.370
...that were inspired by all of the times
that I was in <i>Dynasty</i> and <i>Falcon Crest.</i>

1512
01:10:08.829 --> 01:10:10.789
CINDY: That is absolutely amazing.

1513
01:10:10.956 --> 01:10:13.125
I want you to pan in. Look at these.

1514
01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:15.169
-SARINA: Look at the detail.
-Look at the detail.

1515
01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:17.004
SARINA: Look at the value in that.

1516
01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:19.215
CINDY: About how many sequins
would you say that is?

1517
01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.382
That's it?

1518
01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:21.717
-That's all?
-PEGGY: No, it's over.

1519
01:10:21.759 --> 01:10:22.927
That's how fast it happens.

1520
01:10:23.093 --> 01:10:24.303
MIMI: No, they're gonna give
her a second chance.

1521
01:10:24.428 --> 01:10:26.096
No, they're not gonna give her
a second chance.

1522
01:10:26.263 --> 01:10:28.182
That's not what's gonna happen.

1523
01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:30.517
They're going to give her
a second chance.

1524
01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:32.603
-TONY: Why do you have to be so negative?
-They will.

1525
01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:34.104
$200,000!

1526
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.233
50,000 mops.

1527
01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:41.111
SARINA: Now, this is easily
one of my favorites.

1528
01:10:41.278 --> 01:10:42.780
She's wearing the black and gold...

1529
01:10:42.863 --> 01:10:43.948
(turns off TV)

1530
01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:02.591
(phone ringing)

1531
01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:10.975
Joy.

1532
01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:17.815
Hello?

1533
01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:22.820
5,107 sequins for...

1534
01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:25.030
Get this. How much?

1535
01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:26.907
-$299.
-(gasps)

1536
01:11:30.077 --> 01:11:32.079
I'm sorry the product didn't sell.

1537
01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:38.168
That man didn't know
what he was doing, Neil.

1538
01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:43.132
Well, it wasn't the man, Joy.
It was the product.

1539
01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:52.641
I made 50,000 units
because you told me to.

1540
01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:57.313
I mortgaged my house,
I'm in $200,000 of debt. More.

1541
01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:01.525
Well, it's your business.
It's your debt.

1542
01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:04.778
And we indemnify up to a third,
if you read your contract.

1543
01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:08.324
To be honest,
that's even gonna be hard to get.

1544
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.536
Neil, you gotta give us another chance.

1545
01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:14.663
I'm so sorry, Joy.

1546
01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:17.583
I just can't bring it to my boss.
I can't.

1547
01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.504
I can't accept your answer.

1548
01:12:23.797 --> 01:12:26.967
(whispers) I can't, and I won't.

1549
01:12:28.802 --> 01:12:32.348
RUDY: Joy, you have to let Trudy
report this loss in bankruptcy...

1550
01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:35.267
because otherwise she's gonna
hemorrhage even more money.

1551
01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:37.144
You have to file, too...

1552
01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:39.980
<i>because you mortgaged</i>
<i>your children's future and you lost...</i>

1553
01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:42.649
<i>and you have to</i>
<i>prepare yourself for that.</i>

1554
01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:44.526
TRUDY: <i>You have to file for bankruptcy.</i>

1555
01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:46.612
PEGGY: <i>I warned you so many times, Joy!</i>

1556
01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:48.280
<i>Dad, I warned you</i>
<i>to not spend her money!</i>

1557
01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:50.157
TONY: <i>Come on! You've been</i>
<i>plotting against her</i>

1558
01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.533
<i>from the very beginning, Peggy!</i>

1559
01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.327
PEGGY: <i>Now we're bankrupt, Tony!</i>

1560
01:12:55.412 --> 01:12:57.081
I'm in a meeting with our lawyers.

1561
01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:59.124
What do you think you're doing?

1562
01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:06.215
"Go home, Joy, and watch the numbers
roll in on television.

1563
01:13:07.007 --> 01:13:09.468
"Make 50,000 mops...

1564
01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:13.305
"borrowing and owing every dollar,
including your home."

1565
01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:15.474
It could have been handled better.

1566
01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:17.059
I'll let Todd have another shot.

1567
01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:20.187
I don't want Todd
or anyone else to try it.

1568
01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:22.064
It should be me.

1569
01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.357
We don't have regular people.

1570
01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:26.652
We have celebrities or spokesmodels
do the selling.

1571
01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:28.278
I told you this.

1572
01:13:29.154 --> 01:13:30.697
Who showed you the mop?

1573
01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:32.950
Who sold it to you?
Who taught you how to use it?

1574
01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:36.537
And who convinced you that it was great
after you thought it was worthless?

1575
01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.460
Excuse me, can you give us a second?

1576
01:13:44.628 --> 01:13:46.004
Come with me.

1577
01:13:56.014 --> 01:13:58.976
You ever been in front of a TV camera?
You comfortable in front of a TV camera?

1578
01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:03.021
Because when you get there, there's lights
and there's camera, and people freeze up.

1579
01:14:03.647 --> 01:14:06.608
You said to me that David Selznick,
the son of immigrants...

1580
01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:10.279
married Jennifer Jones,
an all-American girl from Oklahoma...

1581
01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:14.283
because in America,
all races and all classes...

1582
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:17.619
can meet and make
whatever opportunities they can.

1583
01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:23.000
And that is what you feel when you reach
into people's homes with what you sell.

1584
01:14:27.045 --> 01:14:28.046
You said that.

1585
01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:32.718
LORI: What do you think?
Looks great, right?

1586
01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:36.180
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

1587
01:14:36.346 --> 01:14:37.764
Very vogue, very classic.

1588
01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.767
All right, if you come back next time...
Lori? Lori?

1589
01:14:40.934 --> 01:14:43.228
I just want you to just put
the hair a little bit forward,

1590
01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:46.023
just like that, if she comes back again.

1591
01:14:46.398 --> 01:14:48.567
Okay? Not with the comb,
not with the comb.

1592
01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:50.235
-Try the black.
-Okay.

1593
01:14:50.402 --> 01:14:51.528
Okay?

1594
01:14:51.695 --> 01:14:52.696
It's gonna be perfect.

1595
01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:01.288
(indistinct conversations)

1596
01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:04.208
(door opens)

1597
01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:06.460
Wow.

1598
01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:12.466
Beautiful. What do you think?
How do you feel?

1599
01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:16.595
I'd like to change just one thing.
Would you mind?

1600
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:19.181
-Okay, surprise me.
-Small thing.

1601
01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.475
-I'll surprise you.
-Okay, surprise me.

1602
01:15:24.436 --> 01:15:27.356
What would the small thing be
that she changes?

1603
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:29.691
(sighs)

1604
01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:32.319
What?

1605
01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:34.571
You undid the whole thing.

1606
01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:37.783
-This is me.
-This is you?

1607
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:40.327
You've got the exact same outfit
you had when you came in here.

1608
01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:42.663
I wear a blouse and I wear pants.

1609
01:15:42.829 --> 01:15:44.540
That's who I am.

1610
01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:46.625
I want to go on as me.

1611
01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.294
Gonna go on as you.

1612
01:15:49.836 --> 01:15:51.547
(chuckles) I hope you make it back.

1613
01:15:52.297 --> 01:15:54.383
Joan, Cindy. Say good luck to Joy.

1614
01:15:54.466 --> 01:15:55.551
-Wow.
-Wow.

1615
01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:56.885
You look great. Good luck today.

1616
01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:58.053
-Oh, thank you.
-Good luck.

1617
01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.388
NEIL: That's her, that's how she is.

1618
01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.807
Blouse and... She should be in a skirt.
She's got nice long legs.

1619
01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:03.058
Show her legs.

1620
01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:04.226
Good luck.

1621
01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:07.437
Joan Rivers wants me in a skirt,
but I'm gonna do pants.

1622
01:16:07.604 --> 01:16:09.022
NEIL: Do what you want to do.

1623
01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:10.941
Come on, let's go upstairs.

1624
01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.610
(indistinct conversations)

1625
01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:21.827
Are you nervous?

1626
01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:22.995
Yes.

1627
01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:24.955
Just be yourself.

1628
01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:26.582
Just remember, it's all about the hands.

1629
01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:28.750
Here we go.

1630
01:16:44.224 --> 01:16:47.227
MALE QVC COORDINATOR:
Ready... Stage is moving!

1631
01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:51.898
Household product 375 in three, two...

1632
01:16:51.982 --> 01:16:53.650
(bell rings)

1633
01:16:57.571 --> 01:16:59.948
(whispers) What are you doing? Come on.

1634
01:17:00.198 --> 01:17:02.409
Go! Go!

1635
01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:05.412
She's freezing.

1636
01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:09.833
Sorry, these lights are so bright.

1637
01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:11.376
Um...

1638
01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:15.213
Nobody tells you how bright these lights...
Well, Neil did tell me.

1639
01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:16.423
Um...

1640
01:17:17.215 --> 01:17:20.260
Neil is my boss. Here.

1641
01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:25.223
I should thank him
for letting me be up here. Uh...

1642
01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.059
-Sorry.
-NEIL: You're Joy.

1643
01:17:27.225 --> 01:17:28.226
I am Joy.

1644
01:17:28.393 --> 01:17:31.271
(whispers) Just say something!
Talk about the mop!

1645
01:17:31.438 --> 01:17:32.439
Oh, my God.

1646
01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:33.774
We have to do something.

1647
01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:36.443
We have to do something.

1648
01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:38.445
Do we have a call?

1649
01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:39.655
-Could we go to a call?
-We have a call.

1650
01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:40.989
-It's a friendly call?
-It's a friendly call.

1651
01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:43.325
Okay. Take it. Take it.

1652
01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:44.826
Joy, we have a call.

1653
01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:47.079
A call? How did that happen?

1654
01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:49.498
Well, we have a call.

1655
01:17:49.748 --> 01:17:51.249
JACKIE: Hi. Joanne from New York.

1656
01:17:51.416 --> 01:17:52.417
Joanne from New York.

1657
01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:55.045
We have a call coming in
from Joanne from New York.

1658
01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:58.298
JACKIE: Yeah, uh, I'm calling in because
I would love a mop that

1659
01:17:58.382 --> 01:17:59.758
I don't have to touch when I wring it.

1660
01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:02.886
You know, my hands get raw,
and when I mop broken glass...

1661
01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:05.847
and I wring the mop, I cut my hands.

1662
01:18:07.599 --> 01:18:09.935
Do you ever cut your hands
when you're wringing?

1663
01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:12.771
Joanne, that is so funny
that you said that.

1664
01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:17.234
That is actually exactly how
I was inspired to invent this mop.

1665
01:18:17.401 --> 01:18:19.361
There was glass shattered everywhere.

1666
01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:22.447
I was with my two kids,
with my father, and I...

1667
01:18:22.614 --> 01:18:25.909
Every time I would wring the mop,
I would get glass shards in my hands.

1668
01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:29.413
And the old mop
just wasn't very absorbent.

1669
01:18:29.579 --> 01:18:34.626
So I went to my daughter's room,
and I borrowed her crayons...

1670
01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:37.421
and I designed this mop.

1671
01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:39.423
Make sure you get down there.
Yeah, that's it.

1672
01:18:39.589 --> 01:18:41.925
It's made of plastic, so it's lightweight,
but very durable.

1673
01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:43.468
Go in. Go in to the hands.

1674
01:18:43.593 --> 01:18:44.594
It's extremely absorbent...

1675
01:18:44.636 --> 01:18:47.097
with 300 continuous cotton loops...

1676
01:18:47.264 --> 01:18:49.599
that I looped myself
when I designed it.

1677
01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:52.894
-How much is it?
-It is $19.95.

1678
01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:55.439
I like that price.
I want a whole bunch of them.

1679
01:18:55.939 --> 01:18:57.232
Thank you.

1680
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:59.484
(whispers) H375. That's the order number.

1681
01:18:59.651 --> 01:19:01.778
Household item 375.

1682
01:19:01.945 --> 01:19:02.946

1683
01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:04.281
That's it. Stay right there.

1684
01:19:04.448 --> 01:19:06.575
...you are not going to find
another mop like this that exists.

1685
01:19:06.658 --> 01:19:09.995
If there was, I would have bought it
and I wouldn't have cut my hands up.

1686
01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:14.916
You can get across the whole kitchen
with one wring. Just imagine that.

1687
01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:16.418
Watch this.

1688

(whispers) No. Hands, hands.

1693
01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:30.307
Now, the biggest difference,

1694
01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.684
I don't have to touch this
disgusting mop head.

1695
01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:34.770
There's not another mop on the market...

1696
01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:39.483
that has as much absorbent cotton
as this mop right here.

1697
01:19:39.649 --> 01:19:43.445
And I guarantee you,
there will be no regrets, no returns.

1698
01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:46.656

every single day.

this mop has changed my life.

1704
01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:56.374
This is gonna be the greatest mop
to have around Christmas time...

1705
01:19:56.541 --> 01:19:58.460
when you have family over...

1706
01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:02.547
I am a mother of two.
There is just spill after spill.

I haven't even told you about
my personal favorite feature...

1712
01:20:14.684 --> 01:20:16.686
which is the removable mop head...

1713
01:20:16.853 --> 01:20:21.691
that I can put into the washing machine
and it will come out clean as new.

1714

-NEIL: Yes, that's right. Keep it going.
-Thank you.

1718
01:20:31.701 --> 01:20:34.621
This is the most absorbent
mop on the market. It's lightweight.

1719
01:20:34.704 --> 01:20:36.540
It's the only mop that
you're ever gonna buy,

1720
01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:37.999
the best mop you're ever gonna use.

1721
01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:42.420
It is lightweight and durable, and that is
just me speaking from my experience.

1722
01:20:42.587 --> 01:20:46.675
As someone who mops their house
every single day, from my heart.

1723
01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:51.179
This woman's gonna be
a whole new business.

1724

Can you believe it?

1730
01:21:24.504 --> 01:21:27.924
I thought for sure you were gonna tell me
that your counting machine was broken.

1731
01:21:28.091 --> 01:21:29.759
I listened to you. You were right.

1732
01:21:29.926 --> 01:21:32.429
I just can't believe
that actually happened.

1733
01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:33.597
I know.

1734
01:21:33.763 --> 01:21:36.141
I guess you could say
we're friends in commerce.

1735
01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:37.350
Friends in commerce.

1736
01:21:37.434 --> 01:21:38.476
Yeah.

1737
01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:42.063
Let's promise each other that if, one day,
and that day may come...

1738
01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:45.525
that we become adversaries in commerce,
that we remain friends.

1739
01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:47.319
Because that's a true friendship indeed.

1740
01:21:47.485 --> 01:21:48.778
Friends in commerce.

of only two dollars per unit.

We can't increase at all, Peggy.
Don't you understand?

We sold at a certain price.

especially the ones he's asking for...

1818

mean that I will lose so much money...

I spoke to him about a project
that Dad and I have been designing.

1826
01:28:13.997 --> 01:28:15.164
Right, Dad?

1827
01:28:15.331 --> 01:28:16.833
Yes, we did.

how much your idea will cost?

1829

How or where you'll sell it?

1830
01:28:26.509 --> 01:28:29.679

after it's taken everything we've got...

1832

1833
01:28:36.185 --> 01:28:38.855
Maybe my product
is better than your product.

sister does is not easy...

MAN 2: Gerhardt!

1853
01:30:37.348 --> 01:30:38.975
(door opens)

1854
01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:45.523
Hey. I'm Gerhardt.

1855
01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:47.108
I'm Joy.

1856
01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:48.484
Come on in.

1857
01:30:48.651 --> 01:30:49.986
<i>Derek Markham is my boss.</i>

1858
01:30:50.153 --> 01:30:51.279
He lives in Texas.

1859
01:30:51.446 --> 01:30:55.658
Fabri-Pac is one of several companies
he owns or collects royalties for.

1860
01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:59.203
I report to him.
He makes pricing decisions.

1861
01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:02.331
Well, I've never met or talked
to this Derek Markham...

1862
01:31:02.498 --> 01:31:04.167
but I've talked to you many times
on the phone.

1863
01:31:04.333 --> 01:31:05.793
And I do find it very curious...

1864
01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.880
that the second I'm on television,
with a lot of success...

1865
01:31:09.046 --> 01:31:11.340
the price for our products goes up.

1866
01:31:11.507 --> 01:31:14.177
Seems very unfair to me,
to say the least.

1867
01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:17.180
Seems like you're shaking us down.

1868
01:31:17.346 --> 01:31:19.640
GERHARDT: You met Gregory,
our plant foreman.

1869
01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:22.059
GREGORY: It's very hard for us
to lower the cost at this point.

1870
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.729
We're already losing a lot of money.

1871
01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:28.024
How could that possibly be,
with the $500,000 that we've given you...

1872
01:31:28.191 --> 01:31:30.318
on top of the
$50,000 of advance royalties...

1873
01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:33.571
that have gone to a Derek Markham
in Dallas.

1874
01:31:33.738 --> 01:31:35.865
And that's not even counting
what my sister paid you...

1875
01:31:36.032 --> 01:31:37.575
without my authority, by the way...

1876
01:31:37.742 --> 01:31:40.495
for your overcharges and your mistakes.

1877
01:31:41.204 --> 01:31:44.832
Your sister paid the increase
that you refused to pay.

1878
01:31:45.208 --> 01:31:49.003
Well, she had no authority to do that.
She's not an officer of my corporation.

1879
01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:54.509
You and I could both spend a lot of time
and money in court to prove that I'm right...

1880
01:31:55.676 --> 01:31:57.261
but that would just make
our lawyers wealthy...

1881
01:31:57.428 --> 01:31:59.889
while my product dies
instead of being on television...

1882
01:32:00.056 --> 01:32:01.849
like it could be right now.

1883
01:32:02.892 --> 01:32:04.560
You can pay more.

1884
01:32:05.061 --> 01:32:07.688
I can't pay more. I won't.

1885
01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:10.608
GREGORY: Costs are higher.
Wear and tear on the molds.

1886
01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:12.735
We have to remake them every other week.

1887
01:32:12.902 --> 01:32:15.738
Is that so? Can I see the molds?

1888
01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:17.365
GERHARDT: They're in the machines.

1889
01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:20.368
It'll take some time
to prepare them for you.

1890
01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:27.250
Is there a bathroom I could use?

1891
01:32:30.461 --> 01:32:32.755
Yeah, it's down the hall.
Gregory will show you.

1892
01:32:40.972 --> 01:32:42.098
Thanks.

What is this?

1913
01:34:11.687 --> 01:34:14.523
These are my designs,
these are my molds!

1914
01:34:14.690 --> 01:34:15.816
Those are ours!

1915
01:34:15.858 --> 01:34:17.860
And we knew you'd be trouble.
The cops are on their way.

1916
01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:20.196
-We called 'em as soon as you showed up!
-These are my molds!

1917
01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:21.489
Those are ours!

1918
01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:23.407
I'm taking these with me.

1919
01:34:23.699 --> 01:34:24.867
I'm taking all of these with me.

1920
01:34:25.034 --> 01:34:27.370
I want all of these boxed up,
and I'm taking them.

1921
01:34:27.536 --> 01:34:28.663
You're trespassing!

1922
01:34:28.829 --> 01:34:30.039
It's not your patent!

1923
01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:32.375
These are my designs!

1924
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:36.045
I'm not going anywhere without my molds.

1925
01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:38.547
What? No. No.

1926
01:34:38.714 --> 01:34:41.050
This is not stealing.
This is my property!

1927
01:34:41.217 --> 01:34:42.343
This is my property.

1928
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:45.846
I have all of these designs.
These are all mine. They belong to me!

1929
01:34:46.013 --> 01:34:49.600
She's from out of state, John!
You've known me 15 years!

1930
01:34:49.767 --> 01:34:51.394
All right, come on, ma'am.
You're trespassing.

1931
01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.187
-What?
-Yeah. Come on.

1932
01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:54.730
-I'm not trespassing.
-Yeah, you're trespassing.

1933
01:34:54.897 --> 01:34:55.940
I was in his office.

1934
01:34:56.065 --> 01:34:57.400
-You don't know. Come on.
-He let me into his...

1935
01:34:57.566 --> 01:34:58.859
Gerhardt, you're not gonna
get away with this.

1936
01:34:58.901 --> 01:35:01.195
-You're not gonna get away with this!
-Be careful what you're saying.

1937
01:35:01.237 --> 01:35:02.279
You're a thief! You're a thief, Gerhardt!

1938
01:35:02.405 --> 01:35:04.073
Be careful, come on, come on.
Be careful. Come on, stop it.

1939
01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:06.242
-This is stealing!
-Hey, hey, stop it. Come on.

1940
01:35:06.409 --> 01:35:07.451
All right.

1941
01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:12.456
Watch your step. All right.

1942
01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:21.757
RUDY: <i>What about Trudy's money, Joy?</i>

1943
01:35:21.924 --> 01:35:23.926
You have to pay back Trudy's money.

1944
01:35:24.093 --> 01:35:25.636
This is only getting worse.

1945
01:35:25.803 --> 01:35:27.722
I predicted tragedy, Joy.

1946
01:35:28.139 --> 01:35:30.099
You're racking up quite a steep bill.

1947
01:35:30.266 --> 01:35:33.394
We had to fly out here, bail you out.

1948
01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.564
RUDY: Plus it cost us an extra
$10,000 for Ray Cagney...

1949
01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:39.108
this California patent attorney,
to get us to this point.

1950
01:35:39.275 --> 01:35:41.777
RAY: We got the state
to decline prosecution.

1951
01:35:41.944 --> 01:35:43.988
They see it's a contract dispute.

1952
01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:47.658
When you paid royalties
to Derek Markham in Texas...

1953
01:35:47.825 --> 01:35:51.871
it put all your parts and molds
under the umbrella of their patent.

1954
01:35:52.788 --> 01:35:55.958
I see you brought all your drawings
and hung them to prove your design.

1955
01:35:56.125 --> 01:35:58.627
But it's impossible to fight it now.

1956
01:35:58.794 --> 01:36:01.255
You were not properly advised.

1957
01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:03.966
Cristy, please!

1958
01:36:04.133 --> 01:36:05.176
Tony, take her to bed.

1959
01:36:05.301 --> 01:36:07.428
I don't wanna go to bed.
I wanna stay here.

1960
01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:08.971
I paid those royalties...

1961
01:36:09.138 --> 01:36:10.181
because you told me to.

1962
01:36:10.306 --> 01:36:12.975
Because your lawyer told me to.

1963
01:36:13.142 --> 01:36:16.937
TRUDY: Our lawyer was mistaken.
This happens sometimes in business.

1964
01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:18.314
It didn't work out for you.

1965
01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:19.482
It happens sometimes.

1966
01:36:19.648 --> 01:36:20.983
Trudy's lawyer is not a patent attorney.

1967
01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:22.485
Which I said!

1968
01:36:22.651 --> 01:36:26.447
And you said I had no business
being Joy's advisor.

1969
01:36:26.489 --> 01:36:28.824
-And now it turns out that I was right!
-This is not helpful, Tony!

1970
01:36:28.866 --> 01:36:30.701
-That's enough, Tony. Please.
-It's enough, now?

1971
01:36:30.826 --> 01:36:33.454
RAY: I'm very sorry.
I wish there was more I could do.

1972
01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:36.707
But when your sister Peggy paid
the unjustified bills...

1973
01:36:36.874 --> 01:36:38.542
that you refused to pay...

1974
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:40.169
it closed the door on that.

1975
01:36:40.336 --> 01:36:42.046
What about Neil Walker and QVC?

1976
01:36:42.213 --> 01:36:44.715
Wouldn't they pay the expenses
on defending the patent?

1977
01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:46.550
RUDY: Be careful, Joy.

1978
01:36:46.675 --> 01:36:50.304
You could be sued for misrepresentation
and failure to deliver your product.

1979
01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:51.514
That's breach.

1980
01:36:52.389 --> 01:36:55.684
QVC requires that you deliver
a fully patented product.

1981
01:36:55.851 --> 01:36:58.187
RAY: I've been doing this for a long time.

1982
01:36:58.354 --> 01:37:02.358
You're in for a long court process
that will stall your product.

1983
01:37:02.525 --> 01:37:03.984
And you will probably lose.

1984
01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:05.528
I wish I could do more.

1985
01:37:07.196 --> 01:37:08.531
Take care, now.

1986
01:37:08.697 --> 01:37:10.991
Uh, you're gonna have to
accept the facts, Joy.

1987
01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:12.576
I mean, that's...

1988
01:37:13.202 --> 01:37:15.204
You're most of half a million dollars
in debt.

1989
01:37:15.371 --> 01:37:17.206
I don't know how you're gonna pay it.

1990
01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.208
We have to declare bankruptcy.

1991
01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:21.752
You're gonna have to declare bankruptcy.

1992
01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:23.337
I have to declare bankruptcy.

1993
01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:24.547
She has to.

1994
01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:26.048
-To try to contain my losses.
-Yeah.

1995
01:37:26.215 --> 01:37:27.383
I have to write it off.

1996
01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:29.510
It just seems so wrong.

1997
01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.220
We've worked so hard.

1998
01:37:31.387 --> 01:37:33.430
We've come so far
for us to just give up now.

1999
01:37:33.597 --> 01:37:35.057
It just seems so unfair!

2000
01:37:35.224 --> 01:37:37.726
Business is unfair. That's it.

2001
01:37:37.893 --> 01:37:39.895
It's not working out.
Well, that's what happens.

2002
01:37:40.062 --> 01:37:43.774
That's why people don't go around
making invention every other day.

2003
01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:45.025
Wake up!

2004
01:37:45.067 --> 01:37:46.193
RUDY: It's my fault.

2005
01:37:46.235 --> 01:37:49.321
I gave her the confidence to think she was
more than just an unemployed housewife...

2006
01:37:49.405 --> 01:37:52.032
selling plastic kitchen stuff
to other unemployed housewives...

2007
01:37:52.074 --> 01:37:53.200
on a junk cable channel.

2008
01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:56.078
It's my fault.
It's not your fault, honey.

2009
01:37:56.245 --> 01:37:58.747
It was my mistake to make her think
that she was more than she was.

2010
01:37:59.248 --> 01:38:01.792
She pressured herself into doing something
she shouldn't have done.

2011
01:38:01.917 --> 01:38:03.919
It was wrong of you
to put that pressure on yourself.

2012
01:38:04.086 --> 01:38:06.297
It was wrong of us
to put that pressure on you.

2013
01:38:06.463 --> 01:38:07.923
-(ice cubes rattling)
-I need more vodka.

2014
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:13.762
It was wrong of us to think that you'd be
an instant business person overnight.

2015
01:38:13.929 --> 01:38:16.432
Of course, this is not who you are.

2016
01:38:17.433 --> 01:38:22.396
It takes a kind of toughness,
a certain acumen...

2017
01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:25.316
that you simply don't have.

2018
01:38:25.983 --> 01:38:27.318
Sign the paper.

2019
01:38:31.906 --> 01:38:34.325
RUDY: You have to sign
these bankruptcy papers, honey.

2020
01:38:34.491 --> 01:38:36.994
The notary's right outside.
Let me get her.

2021
01:38:40.998 --> 01:38:43.125
You're gonna have to move
out of your house immediately.

2022
01:38:44.084 --> 01:38:45.461
You're gonna have to move
into an apartment.

2023
01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:48.297
Maybe you can move into a room
in Trudy's house.

2024
01:38:48.464 --> 01:38:49.632
With the children?

2025
01:38:49.798 --> 01:38:51.592
RUDY: Yeah. You have room.

2026
01:38:52.009 --> 01:38:53.469
She's my daughter. Why not?

2027
01:38:54.803 --> 01:38:56.347
Let's talk about it.

2028
01:38:56.847 --> 01:38:58.349
RUDY: Trudy,
we have to offer her something.

2029
01:38:58.515 --> 01:38:59.642
TRUDY: Again?

2030
01:38:59.683 --> 01:39:00.976
Why me?

2031
01:39:08.525 --> 01:39:10.319
RUDY: Please sign, honey.

2032
01:39:31.382 --> 01:39:32.466
(stamp clicks)

2033
01:39:36.679 --> 01:39:37.721
Thank you.

2034
01:39:41.517 --> 01:39:45.896
Mimi said you were the one born
to help carry the family to success.

2035
01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:52.236
No, Cristy. Mimi was wrong.

2036
01:39:53.696 --> 01:39:55.906
The world does not give you opportunities.

2037
01:39:56.073 --> 01:40:00.869
The world destroys your opportunity
and it breaks your heart.

2038
01:40:01.537 --> 01:40:05.082
I should have listened to my mother
when I was 10 years old.

2039
01:40:05.249 --> 01:40:06.875
I should have spent the rest of my life...

2040
01:40:07.042 --> 01:40:10.045
watching TV and hiding from the world
like my mother.

2041
01:40:11.005 --> 01:40:13.549
So I don't wanna hear
any more about Mimi.

2042
01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.217
(sniffles) She was wrong.

2043
01:40:15.384 --> 01:40:18.846
She had her head in the clouds.
And it was full of stupid ideas.

2044
01:40:19.013 --> 01:40:21.181
And it gave me stupid ideas.

2045
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:22.558
(sobs)

2046
01:40:23.726 --> 01:40:24.727
Like this.

2047
01:40:27.563 --> 01:40:29.732
This stupid, stupid idea!

2048
01:40:29.898 --> 01:40:31.608
-(mop clatters)
-(Joy crying)

2049
01:40:32.693 --> 01:40:35.237
CRISTY: Mommy, don't tear them! No!

2050
01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:39.867
(yells)

2051
01:40:42.953 --> 01:40:44.621
(continues crying)

2052
01:40:56.925 --> 01:40:59.094
(whispers) Cristy, I'm so sorry.

2053
01:40:59.261 --> 01:41:01.305
I'm sorry, Cristy.

2054
01:41:01.472 --> 01:41:03.098
I'm so sorry.

2055
01:41:03.265 --> 01:41:05.642
Please go to bed.
Everybody just go to bed.

2056
01:41:07.102 --> 01:41:08.729
Good night, Mommy.

2057
01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:10.981
JOY: Good night, sweetheart.
Just go to bed.

2058
01:41:13.609 --> 01:41:16.236
RUDY: I'm so sorry I failed you, Joy.
I'm so sorry.

2059
01:41:16.403 --> 01:41:17.946
JOY: Just, just don't.

2060
01:41:19.948 --> 01:41:21.241
(door closes)

2061
01:42:49.621 --> 01:42:51.874
Joy? Joy?

2062
01:42:52.541 --> 01:42:53.917
Joy, where are you?

2063
01:42:55.919 --> 01:42:57.713
Joy, where are you?

2064
01:44:07.366 --> 01:44:08.492
(knocking on door)

2065
01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:12.663
It's open.

2066
01:44:20.462 --> 01:44:21.797
You can leave the door open.

2067
01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:49.741
No one knows I'm here.

2068
01:44:50.784 --> 01:44:52.786
You don't even know who I am.

2069
01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:55.122
I could be Derek Markham

2070
01:44:55.163 --> 01:44:58.458
or I might be someone Derek Markham sent
to handle you.

2071
01:44:58.917 --> 01:45:00.961
You have no case.

2072
01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:05.340
Maybe people think you came to Dallas
in despair to take your own life...

2073
01:45:05.507 --> 01:45:07.426
because you were
in such deep financial trouble

2074
01:45:07.509 --> 01:45:10.429
suddenly from your little venture.

2075
01:45:17.102 --> 01:45:20.397
I made a phone call this morning
to Hong Kong.

2076
01:45:21.064 --> 01:45:23.066
It was 1:00 a.m. in California

2077
01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:26.153
but it was 5:00 p.m.
the following afternoon in Hong Kong.

2078
01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:30.615
I always think it's amazing
how time works like that.

2079
01:45:32.367 --> 01:45:35.495
And I was fortunate enough to get
on the phone with Mr. Christopher...

2080
01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:38.707
who I found to be very friendly,
which was surprising...

2081
01:45:38.874 --> 01:45:42.002
because I really haven't found
the gentlemen in California to be very nice...

2082
01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:44.546
considering we're all
in business together.

2083
01:45:44.713 --> 01:45:48.508
Welcome to the world of business,
I guess.

2084
01:45:49.551 --> 01:45:51.803
I told Mr. Christopher
that the reason that I was calling...

2085
01:45:51.970 --> 01:45:56.016
was to discuss the differences
in the designs of our products.

2086
01:45:56.641 --> 01:46:01.021
But I quickly learned that
Mr. Christopher has no idea...

2087
01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:04.483
if his Hong Kong patent
for a self-wringing mop

2088
01:46:04.566 --> 01:46:07.319
is worth anything or if it even works.

2089
01:46:07.944 --> 01:46:13.033
Because they have not made
or sold a single mop.

2090
01:46:13.283 --> 01:46:16.995
Unlike us, who have sold over 200,000.

2091
01:46:18.121 --> 01:46:22.918
And I've paid you over $50,000
in advanced royalties...

2092
01:46:23.085 --> 01:46:25.045
on behalf of Mr. Christopher.

2093
01:46:25.587 --> 01:46:30.467
Blood money from my family
and my second mortgage.

2094
01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:36.014
Turns out Mr. Christopher doesn't know
anything about those royalties.

2095
01:46:36.264 --> 01:46:37.724
So it seems...

2096
01:46:38.892 --> 01:46:42.479
we have a case of fraud and embezzlement.

2097
01:46:45.524 --> 01:46:48.735
And, as if that weren't bad enough...

2098
01:46:49.611 --> 01:46:51.738
I also discovered in the paperwork

2099
01:46:51.822 --> 01:46:55.117
that our mops actually
don't bear any similarities.

2100
01:46:55.283 --> 01:46:58.412
So I never did owe you
any royalties for your patent.

2101
01:46:59.454 --> 01:47:01.415
That's another case of fraud.

2102
01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:07.963
My lawyers really could go after you,
but I told them, "Give me a day."

2103
01:47:08.130 --> 01:47:14.094
To see if maybe
you might've made a mistake...

2104
01:47:15.929 --> 01:47:18.849
that you would correct,
given the chance.

2105
01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:37.242
We'll pay you back all the royalties
you paid us.

2106
01:47:41.455 --> 01:47:46.960
(stammering) I'll give you $20,000
on top of paying you back the 50.

2107
01:47:58.889 --> 01:48:00.140
Okay.

2108
01:48:01.850 --> 01:48:05.562
I'll give you $50,000
on top of paying you back the 50.

2109
01:48:17.657 --> 01:48:19.242
Plus interest.

2110
01:48:24.706 --> 01:48:26.708
I want all of my molds back.

2111
01:48:27.375 --> 01:48:29.669
I want you to sign this piece of paper...

2112
01:48:30.712 --> 01:48:33.965
saying that you have
no rights, financially.

2113
01:48:35.008 --> 01:48:38.470
I'm just gonna add...
I said the 50...

2114
01:48:40.597 --> 01:48:42.557
plus the 50...

2115
01:48:44.351 --> 01:48:47.020
plus the interest.

2116
01:48:47.187 --> 01:48:51.274
So I just want you to initial
next to those two numbers as well.

2117
01:48:57.322 --> 01:48:58.865
So just sign there.

2118
01:49:06.831 --> 01:49:09.376
MIMI: <i>She put up with just about anything.</i>

2119
01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:12.796
<i>Until when she had to</i>
<i>bring the hammer down...</i>

2120
01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:16.049
<i>she brought the hammer down.</i>

2121
01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:21.012
<i>She couldn't know what was to come.</i>

2122
01:49:21.930 --> 01:49:25.976
<i>That she'd go on to make</i>
<i>another 100 record-setting patents.</i>

2123
01:49:26.935 --> 01:49:30.480
<i>Skinny velvet hangers</i>
<i>make neater closets.</i>

2124
01:49:30.647 --> 01:49:32.983
<i>That's a big deal to a lot of people.</i>

2125
01:49:34.150 --> 01:49:36.611
<i>I mean, who thinks of things like that?</i>

2126
01:49:37.779 --> 01:49:39.030
<i>Joy did.</i>

2127
01:49:43.326 --> 01:49:48.540
<i>She didn't know any of this would happen</i>
<i>as she walked down the street that day.</i>

2128
01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:50.250
MAN: Yes, sir.

2129
01:49:50.333 --> 01:49:53.253
Tonight's the night for Ol' Saint Nick
to make his yearly visit

2130
01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:55.380
to all the folks all over the world.

2131
01:49:55.547 --> 01:49:59.050
There's fun and expectation
in every house across the land.

2132
01:49:59.217 --> 01:50:03.305
And speaking of houses, what do you say
we take a little look-in on a typical one?

2133
01:50:03.388 --> 01:50:05.307
(music box playing
"Winter Wonderland")

2134
01:50:06.308 --> 01:50:11.730
Now I'll admit that what you see right now
is just a small piece of the front of a house,

2135
01:50:11.896 --> 01:50:15.692
but all you grownups and kids alike,
this is the time for Santa's magic.

2136
01:50:15.859 --> 01:50:19.029
So I think we can make it
become a real house.

2137
01:50:19.904 --> 01:50:21.448
Even a house with love in it.

2138
01:50:21.531 --> 01:50:24.618
Mr. Santa Claus, can we have
a little snow, please?

2139
01:50:26.661 --> 01:50:28.622
Thank you. That's fine.

2140
01:50:28.872 --> 01:50:32.959
Now, Santa, let me see what it
really looks like inside this house.

2141
01:50:33.168 --> 01:50:35.962
("A House With Love In It" playing)

2142
01:50:44.471 --> 01:50:45.722
See what I mean?

2143
01:50:46.931 --> 01:50:49.643
♪ A house with love in it ♪

2144
01:50:51.686 --> 01:50:54.230
♪ Is rich indeed ♪

2145
01:50:55.315 --> 01:50:58.860
♪ Although there are a thousand things ♪

2146
01:50:59.611 --> 01:51:01.863
♪ That house may need ♪

2147
01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:06.826
MIMI: <i>She couldn't know that one day</i>
<i>she would move into a big beautiful home.</i>

2148
01:51:09.371 --> 01:51:11.623
<i>Her mother was happy.</i>

2149
01:51:12.415 --> 01:51:16.670
<i>She remained close to her,</i>
<i>and with the rest of her family...</i>

2150
01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:19.547
<i>which was, as always, complicated.</i>

2151
01:51:21.716 --> 01:51:26.888
<i>She would pay for products</i>
<i>made by Rudy, Trudy, and Peggy.</i>

2152
01:51:27.097 --> 01:51:29.182
<i>Even when they failed.</i>

2153
01:51:29.849 --> 01:51:34.562
<i>Even when they wrongly sued</i>
<i>for ownership of her company.</i>

2154
01:51:35.438 --> 01:51:36.981
<i>As Rudy got older,</i>

2155
01:51:37.065 --> 01:51:40.193
<i>Joy continued to take care</i>
<i>of him and love him.</i>

2156
01:51:46.032 --> 01:51:51.746
<i>As Neil Walker predicted,</i>
<i>Joy did become a whole new business.</i>

2157
01:51:52.122 --> 01:51:53.957
<i>And even outgrew QVC.</i>

2158
01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.167
-She's talking to her children.
-Is Tony in there?

2159
01:51:56.251 --> 01:51:57.585
Yes, Tony's in there.
The family's in there.

2160
01:51:57.752 --> 01:52:03.925
MIMI: <i>Her ex-husband and her best friend</i>
<i>would remain her steadfast advisers.</i>

2161
01:52:04.092 --> 01:52:05.427
Please be patient.

2162
01:52:11.224 --> 01:52:13.351
I love you.
You guys go and pack your rooms.

2163
01:52:13.518 --> 01:52:15.311
-Good night, Mom.
-I love you.

2164
01:52:16.271 --> 01:52:19.357
(both speaking Spanish)

2165
01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:25.447
-Hi.
-Hi.

2166
01:52:25.613 --> 01:52:27.282
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

2167
01:52:28.199 --> 01:52:29.784
(baby gurgles)

2168
01:52:29.951 --> 01:52:31.035
What do you have?

2169
01:52:31.202 --> 01:52:32.912
A traveling clothes cleaner.

2170
01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:34.080
Let's see it.

2171
01:52:34.998 --> 01:52:36.166
So you're from Memphis?

2172
01:52:36.332 --> 01:52:37.584
Yes, I am.

2173
01:52:37.751 --> 01:52:38.877
You work as a waitress?

2174
01:52:39.043 --> 01:52:40.253
Yes, ma'am.

2175
01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:42.881
All right. Let's see it.

2176
01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:45.592
You made this yourself?

2177
01:52:45.759 --> 01:52:46.760
Yes, I did, ma'am.

2178
01:52:47.719 --> 01:52:49.971
I made my first invention myself, too.

2179
01:52:51.431 --> 01:52:53.391
I like this, it's a very good design.

2180
01:52:53.475 --> 01:52:54.601
Thank you.

2181
01:52:54.684 --> 01:52:57.187
Can you stay an extra day,
meet with our designers?

2182
01:52:58.021 --> 01:52:59.272
No, because of your boss?

2183
01:53:00.857 --> 01:53:02.650
What hotel are you staying in right now?

2184
01:53:02.817 --> 01:53:04.444
-Uh, the Holiday Inn.
-Holiday Inn.

2185
01:53:04.527 --> 01:53:06.696
Let's move them over to the Radisson,
get them a suite.

2186
01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:08.323
You'll be more comfortable
with your baby.

2187
01:53:08.406 --> 01:53:11.201
I'll call your boss and get it taken care of,
give you an extra day...

2188
01:53:11.367 --> 01:53:13.536
so that tomorrow you can come in,
meet with the designers.

2189
01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:15.747
-We can take it step by step, all right?
-Thank you. (sobs)

2190
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:17.499
We'll work on your idea,
see if we can do something.

2191
01:53:17.665 --> 01:53:19.501
This means so much to me.

2192
01:53:19.751 --> 01:53:21.252
I know what it feels like.

2193
01:53:21.711 --> 01:53:23.797
I know what it feels like
to be in that chair.

2194
01:53:24.464 --> 01:53:26.382
-We'll see you tomorrow, okay?
-Thank you, ma'am.

2195
01:53:26.508 --> 01:53:27.801
And good luck.

2196
01:53:28.051 --> 01:53:29.385
-TONY: Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

2197
01:53:29.552 --> 01:53:32.263
-Go get the next person, Tony.
-Okay.

2198
01:53:32.806 --> 01:53:33.807
Neil.

2199
01:53:35.892 --> 01:53:38.019
NEIL: Sorry, we have legal stuff
with Barry, now.

2200
01:53:41.356 --> 01:53:42.816
JOY: Yes, we do.

2201
01:53:44.192 --> 01:53:45.652
Here we are.

2202
01:53:45.819 --> 01:53:46.945
JOY: Here we are.

2203
01:53:48.571 --> 01:53:50.615
Adversaries in commerce.

2204
01:53:51.449 --> 01:53:53.660
Adversaries in commerce.

2205
01:53:54.828 --> 01:53:56.579
-And friends.
-Yes.

2206
01:53:57.038 --> 01:53:58.248
And friends.

2207
01:53:59.791 --> 01:54:02.126
I'm gonna tell you something
but you didn't hear it from me.

2208
01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:04.587
I don't know who you are
or what you're talking about.

2209
01:54:04.754 --> 01:54:06.381
That's what I wanted to hear.

2210
01:54:08.174 --> 01:54:10.093
Barry's gonna come after you, hard.

2211
01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:13.638
But that's just business.
That's the way Barry is. He's a negotiator.

2212
01:54:13.805 --> 01:54:16.015
Ultimately, he needs you.

2213
01:54:16.182 --> 01:54:19.310
He's buying HSN.

2214
01:54:19.477 --> 01:54:22.814
It's all about HSN now,
and he wants you to come with him.

2215
01:54:25.233 --> 01:54:26.776
He needs you.

2216
01:54:27.569 --> 01:54:29.696
You're going to be very big over there.

2217
01:54:30.196 --> 01:54:32.115
That's what's going to happen.

2218
01:54:32.532 --> 01:54:35.326
But, you didn't hear it from me, right?

2219
01:54:35.952 --> 01:54:40.123
No, I sure didn't.
But thank you.

2220
01:54:43.459 --> 01:54:45.378
It's nice to see you.

2221
01:54:45.545 --> 01:54:47.130
It's good to see you.

2222
01:54:49.424 --> 01:54:51.467
I'll see you around, pal.

2223
01:54:51.634 --> 01:54:53.595
Yeah.

2224
01:55:00.768 --> 01:55:01.853
It's been a long journey.

2225
01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:03.021
Yes, it has.

2226
01:55:03.187 --> 01:55:04.188
I'm proud of you.

2227
01:55:04.355 --> 01:55:05.565
Thank you, Neil.
