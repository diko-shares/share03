00:13:14.407 --> 00:13:18.503
Every man in that army idolizes
you, Your Majesty.

159
00:13:18.578 --> 00:13:20.375
Don't mollycoddle me.

160
00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:25.042
I understand how difficult it
must be to befriend a king.

when you gave the order

descend upon their heads,

We'll start with this.

521
00:44:20.471 --> 00:44:24.036
Make way for the King!
Make way!

Make way!

525
00:44:35.319 --> 00:44:38.481
Godfrey, my friend.
It's so good to see you.

526
00:44:38.556 --> 00:44:41.490
How were your travels?
Good, Sire.

527
00:44:41.692 --> 00:44:44.052
What happened to your face?

528
00:44:44.095 --> 00:44:47.224
A hunting accident.
It's nothing.

529
00:44:47.231 --> 00:44:48.926
Frightening.
Your Majesty.

530
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.292
Call it a dueling scar.
The ladies will love you all the more.

531
00:44:53.337 --> 00:44:55.498
I bow to your knowledge
of the ladies, Sire.

Answer me.

4 men, 5 horses, one gray.

Have you seen them?
That way.

561
00:48:44.501 --> 00:48:48.597
The living king of sermons

562

By Christ! Can you not
sing a happy tune?

567
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:11.853
Sing a foot-stomper about adventure
and daring and courage.

I think something is owed
for this good fortune,

576
00:49:37.721 --> 00:49:39.211
and I mean to pay it back.

577
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:41.484
How so?

578
00:49:41.925 --> 00:49:45.922
The inscription on the sword,
it taunts my memory.

579
00:49:45.996 --> 00:49:49.331
Maybe it's just my imagination,
I don't know.

580
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.494
But I intend to take that
sword back to its owner

581

Marshal, you speak for the money.

601

I do, Sire.

602
00:52:20.451 --> 00:52:24.709
But to disband the army
could cost more than to keep it.

603

King Richard's campaigns were costly.
And the expected returns.. .

604

What is that to me, Marshal?

605
00:52:34.665 --> 00:52:38.056
My brother's troubles are over!

606
00:52:38.402 --> 00:52:40.729

The crown is owed money at home.

619

The northern barons plead poverty,
but that's always been the song of rich men.

620
00:53:30.621 --> 00:53:33.786
So, what's to be done?

621
00:53:48.305 --> 00:53:51.731
Give me leave, Sire, to go north
with a company of mounted men.

622
00:53:51.808 --> 00:53:54.699
I'll have the merchants and
landowners fill your coffers

623
00:53:54.711 --> 00:53:56.338

No man loyal to the crown
has anything to fear.

626
00:54:02.519 --> 00:54:08.413
And loyalty means paying your
share in the defense of the realm.

627
00:54:08.725 --> 00:54:10.749
That's well said.

628
00:54:11.261 --> 00:54:13.756
Don't you think, Marshal?

630
00:54:15.566 --> 00:54:20.863
Richard commanded loyalty
not by threats but by example.

631
00:54:20.871 --> 00:54:24.231
Mother, your sainted
son was an imbecile.

632
00:54:24.308 --> 00:54:29.971
And you supported his every folly
from here to Jerusalem and back.

633
00:54:30.047 --> 00:54:33.175
Yes, you worshipped him

634

hard won by his father.

635
00:54:37.354 --> 00:54:39.447

he was captured.

I think you've spent enough
time with my family

645
00:55:32.643 --> 00:55:35.903
and no doubt, would like
to spend more with your own.

646

No, so if I say this is my son,

783
01:07:58.955 --> 01:08:04.621

And so, as your husband?

belongs to His Majesty.

867

These things are God's gifts first
before the King's possessions.

868
01:16:48.317 --> 01:16:52.117

to fend for himself

869
01:16:52.187 --> 01:16:54.087

man in his own right?

870

874

Tom Chamberlain. Pig farmer.

875
01:17:12.775 --> 01:17:14.299
You don't look a day older, Tom.

876
01:17:15.311 --> 01:17:17.176
Sir Robert.

877
01:17:17.313 --> 01:17:19.611
When will our young
lads come back to us?

878
01:17:20.182 --> 01:17:23.117
Will you find my Jamie,
tell him to come home?

879
01:17:25.888 --> 01:17:29.722
With no work and little food,
the village boys have gone.

880
01:17:29.792 --> 01:17:32.192
To be soldiers?
Poachers.

881
01:17:37.566 --> 01:17:38.999
Look at that, mate.

882
01:17:42.037 --> 01:17:43.732
Still here then?

883
01:17:45.708 --> 01:17:49.804
For the time being, refer to me
as Sir Robert. I'll explain later.

884
01:17:50.212 --> 01:17:54.046

This is about as courtly as they get.

885
01:17:54.483 --> 01:17:57.884

and Little John.

886
01:17:57.953 --> 01:17:59.079
Lady Marion.

887
01:18:05.894 --> 01:18:08.920
I trust you had an historic evening.

888
01:18:09.465 --> 01:18:10.625
For sure.

889
01:18:15.204 --> 01:18:18.469
Lady Marion Loxley.
My wife.

890
01:18:19.241 --> 01:18:20.708
Well played.

891
01:18:21.243 --> 01:18:24.576
A bit rash but well
played nonetheless.

892
01:18:24.646 --> 01:18:26.238
Right you are, Robin.

893
01:18:26.448 --> 01:18:27.745

894
01:18:27.816 --> 01:18:29.408

Sir.. .

895
01:18:30.019 --> 01:18:31.816
Sir. Sir.

896
01:18:31.887 --> 01:18:33.548
Sir Bob.
Sir Robert.

897
01:18:40.863 --> 01:18:42.125
Friar.

898
01:18:43.699 --> 01:18:48.363
Marion. Good news travels
from Peper Harow this morning.

899
01:18:49.171 --> 01:18:51.662
Sir Robert, nice to see you again.

900
01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:55.437
You should've made yourself known
when we met in the field. Welcome home.

901
01:18:56.145 --> 01:18:58.807
Yes, I should've.
Forgive me, Friar.

902
01:19:00.049 --> 01:19:01.516
What happens here?

903
01:19:01.583 --> 01:19:04.051
We're moving the Church's grain to York.

904
01:19:04.119 --> 01:19:05.882
Politics out of London, I hear.

905
01:19:05.954 --> 01:19:08.923
This is our grain.
It belongs in this soil.

906
01:19:08.991 --> 01:19:12.017
Lady Marion, I but follow
the orders of my superiors

907
01:19:12.094 --> 01:19:14.494
and abide by their
saying and rule.

908
01:19:19.535 --> 01:19:22.026
Does His Holiness know
about your wealth of honey?

909
01:19:23.972 --> 01:19:28.204
There are wolves in York, Sir Robert.
Voracious wolves.

910
01:19:29.611 --> 01:19:31.306
The bees are my family.

911
01:19:31.747 --> 01:19:33.908
I'm a procreator by design.

912
01:19:34.616 --> 01:19:37.380
I'm not a churchy friar.
Never was.

913
01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:39.983
My bees give life.

914
01:19:40.689 --> 01:19:42.452
They are my life, Sir Robert.

915
01:19:42.524 --> 01:19:44.424
Should not the Bishop be told

916
01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.688
so the clergy can spread
Nottingham honey on Nottingham bread?

917
01:19:50.999 --> 01:19:53.900
What if the grain were
not to reach York?

918
01:19:55.337 --> 01:19:58.704
Then the bees need
not be spoken of.

919
01:20:07.816 --> 01:20:11.047
I was an old maid
when Robert courted me.

920
01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:15.489
I was a daughter of a respectable widow
with a thimbleful of noble blood.

921
01:20:15.924 --> 01:20:19.655
We were wed and
then a week later

922
01:20:20.062 --> 01:20:23.828
he left to join ship for
France and the Holy Lands.

923
01:20:23.899 --> 01:20:26.925
And that was my
married life to a man

924
01:20:28.937 --> 01:20:30.632
I hardly knew.

925
01:20:33.675 --> 01:20:36.109
A good knight. Short, but sweet.

926
01:20:37.179 --> 01:20:40.307
I mean, he was a good knight.

927
01:20:40.883 --> 01:20:42.874
A good knight-at-arms, a soldier.

928
01:20:42.951 --> 01:20:45.283
Oh yes, my knight-in-arms,
even so.

929
01:20:45.354 --> 01:20:47.117

Nicely done, sir.

And to see Lady Marion Loxley's legs,
beyond my wildest hopes this morning.

know my husband,

Welcome home, Sir Robert.

947
01:22:52.514 --> 01:22:56.382
You make your mark quickly by
rescuing the King's ram from drowning.

948
01:22:56.885 --> 01:22:57.943
What's this?

949
01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:02.252

I thought as much.

Why is that, good friar?

it as a miracle from God.

He was a visionary.

01:45:35.442 --> 01:45:38.104
That kings have a need
of their subjects

1190
01:45:38.178 --> 01:45:42.046

He had a way of speaking

that took you by the ears
and by the heart.

1194
01:45:51.258 --> 01:45:54.125
None of these things
can be written down, Robin.

1195
01:45:54.194 --> 01:45:56.958
