1
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.934
What's going on?

2
00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:29.830
Don't be foolish, Walter.
Get him back to bed.

3
00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:31.540
- Bar the door.
- I'm still the master of this house.

4
00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:33.001
Richard, up.

5
00:02:35.713 --> 00:02:37.171
Who is there?

6
00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:38.836
Wake up, Thomas.

7
00:02:44.513 --> 00:02:46.055
Open the gates!

8
00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:57.019
Bastards.

9
00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.022
Arrow.

10
00:03:03.114 --> 00:03:04.526
The lantern.

11
00:03:15.252 --> 00:03:17.080
I see you, you little bastards.

12
00:03:17.671 --> 00:03:19.000
I see you!

13
00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.393
Thieving maggots.

14
00:03:33.896 --> 00:03:36.303
They've taken all our seed grain.

15
00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:39.640
What are we going to do for planting?

16
00:03:40.485 --> 00:03:41.600
Pray.

17
00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:47.879
Hello, there!

18
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:03.479
- Here you go, lad.
- Thank you, Robin.

19
00:05:03.944 --> 00:05:05.105
Robin.

20
00:05:05.654 --> 00:05:07.028
The archers been called to ranks.

21
00:05:07.114 --> 00:05:08.986
Bloody typical. I'm starving.

22
00:05:10.408 --> 00:05:11.606
Hide these well.

23
00:05:11.993 --> 00:05:14.484
We'll have them for supper instead.

24
00:05:31.136 --> 00:05:32.251
Sire.

25
00:05:33.556 --> 00:05:35.133
Your bath, Sire.

26
00:05:53.117 --> 00:05:55.787
For the love of Christ, Loxley,
would you stop them doing that!

27
00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:57.411
They love you, Sire.

28
00:05:57.497 --> 00:06:00.069
My head. It's going like the bells of hell.

29
00:06:03.043 --> 00:06:04.123
Is that it?

30
00:06:04.212 --> 00:06:08.589
One more castle to sack,
then we're home to England.

31
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:11.959
Hail King Richard!

32
00:06:17.183 --> 00:06:18.428
Release!

33
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.090
Push!

34
00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:22.770
Push!

35
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.315
Hey, archer!

36
00:06:25.733 --> 00:06:26.978
Stay alive!

37
00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:28.265
I'll see you tonight.

38
00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:30.396
Don't forget your money this time, little man.

39
00:06:30.487 --> 00:06:32.481
It will be my pleasure to take it off you.

40
00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:35.488
Push!

41
00:06:40.164 --> 00:06:41.409
Move up!

42
00:06:46.963 --> 00:06:49.001
Cover the King! Cover the King!

43
00:06:52.884 --> 00:06:55.007
Barricades prepare!

44
00:07:03.854 --> 00:07:05.846
Let us put these French to bed!

45
00:07:10.318 --> 00:07:12.359
Raise the barricades!

46
00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:26.621
Jimmy.

47
00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:28.953
Calm and careful. Make it count.

48
00:07:29.212 --> 00:07:30.243
Go!

49
00:07:53.153 --> 00:07:54.184
Help!

50
00:07:55.823 --> 00:07:56.985
Cover!

51
00:08:08.794 --> 00:08:09.873
Now.

52
00:08:13.298 --> 00:08:14.329
Go!

53
00:08:23.642 --> 00:08:24.970
Move back!

54
00:08:26.436 --> 00:08:28.144
Blood for France!

55
00:08:29.939 --> 00:08:30.971
Go!

56
00:08:32.442 --> 00:08:34.316
Lt'll make a fine pin cushion!

57
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:36.442
King Philip's arse!

58
00:08:50.627 --> 00:08:56.374
Look what they do for the Lion Heart!

59
00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:00.381
Push!

60
00:09:01.013 --> 00:09:02.341
Push!

61
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.467
That'll burn all night, lads.
Don't let them put it out.

62
00:09:05.558 --> 00:09:08.974
These pricks will smash through
in the morning, take all the credit.

63
00:09:09.062 --> 00:09:10.605
Well done, Jimmy boy.

64
00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:32.912
John...

65
00:09:33.002 --> 00:09:34.461
Your Majesty.

66
00:09:35.088 --> 00:09:38.124
An English princess
shut out of her husband's bedchamber

67
00:09:38.216 --> 00:09:40.339
by a piece of French pastry!

68
00:09:40.426 --> 00:09:41.968
Aren't you ashamed?

69
00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:43.880
The shame is surely his.

70
00:09:43.971 --> 00:09:45.964
Then go in and tell him.

71
00:09:46.057 --> 00:09:49.675
Mewling at his keyhole
is neither one thing nor the other.

72
00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:51.891
John.

73
00:09:57.318 --> 00:09:59.061
Oh, God! What in heaven...

74
00:09:59.152 --> 00:10:03.482
Mademoiselle, you will excuse me.
My son has need of my advice.

75
00:10:03.573 --> 00:10:05.365
No, I don't. Ask her.

76
00:10:07.495 --> 00:10:09.203
Mother, please, have you no decency?

77
00:10:09.287 --> 00:10:13.830
I happen to be in a condition
that no mother should see her son in.

78
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:20.541
- Yes, I know, but it's my mother.
- That's enough.

79
00:10:20.633 --> 00:10:25.296
On second thoughts, I think it better
that you do hear what I have to say.

80
00:10:25.388 --> 00:10:28.223
Though I will not have you in my presence.

81
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:29.922
Mother.

82
00:10:30.017 --> 00:10:33.885
The purpose of my being in this room
is to save the realm

83
00:10:33.979 --> 00:10:38.060
from the consequences
of this unsuitable amusement.

84
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.772
Her uncle is the bloody King of France.

85
00:10:42.029 --> 00:10:43.986
- My uncle is...
- Get down.

86
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.734
Her uncle wants her back.

87
00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:50.493
Philip wants an excuse to cross

88
00:10:52.873 --> 00:10:54.664
the Channel with an army.

89
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.323
And you have given him that excuse.

90
00:10:58.295 --> 00:11:01.249
Take up your lawful wife and save England.

91
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.005
My lawful wife is as barren as a brick.

92
00:11:05.344 --> 00:11:08.048
Is that truly the wife you want for me?

93
00:11:08.472 --> 00:11:09.634
Hmm?

94
00:11:09.723 --> 00:11:13.010
You, who honoured your husband
with eight children

95
00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:15.639
so that even now
when death has taken the rest

96
00:11:15.729 --> 00:11:20.687
you have a king and the runt of the litter
to call you "Mother."

97
00:11:21.193 --> 00:11:23.434
Better the bastard of a servant girl

98
00:11:23.528 --> 00:11:26.102
than bed the niece
of England's jealous enemy.

99
00:11:26.198 --> 00:11:28.771
Or bed her and wed her, Mother.

100
00:11:28.867 --> 00:11:31.440
I've asked the Pope's men
to arrange an annulment.

101
00:11:31.536 --> 00:11:33.280
And do you think the Pope

102
00:11:33.371 --> 00:11:36.954
will favour England's royal runt
over the King of France?

103
00:11:37.042 --> 00:11:40.126
He might see his way
for the son of Eleanor of Aquitaine.

104
00:11:40.253 --> 00:11:42.625
And for the future King of England.

105
00:11:42.714 --> 00:11:46.498
Richard the Lion Heart is 40-years-old,
if not more.

106
00:11:47.802 --> 00:11:49.296
And no babies.

107
00:11:50.514 --> 00:11:52.590
I am a queen in the making.

108
00:11:54.852 --> 00:11:56.595
Yes. Yes.

109
00:11:58.272 --> 00:11:59.470
You see?

110
00:12:00.691 --> 00:12:03.016
She is my Eleanor.

111
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.649
Now, you do understand,
this game is not about luck.

112
00:12:09.742 --> 00:12:12.659
It's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.

113
00:12:12.745 --> 00:12:14.452
Who'd like to take
a bit of fresh meat home?

114
00:12:14.538 --> 00:12:16.614
Caught this morning. We have a pheasant.

115
00:12:16.707 --> 00:12:19.198
Three choices. Right, left or middle?

116
00:12:19.293 --> 00:12:20.372
Middle.

117
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.867
"The middle," he says. The middle.

118
00:12:22.963 --> 00:12:27.008
I'm sorry about those onions, young man.
You lose.

119
00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:28.633
Robin! Over here, they're needed for the pot.

120
00:12:28.719 --> 00:12:30.129
Feisty one!

121
00:12:31.013 --> 00:12:33.764
Aye, what else we got, what else we got?

122
00:12:33.849 --> 00:12:35.509
The fire will do its work.

123
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.174
We break through at first light.

124
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.887
With a fair wind,
we can be home in three days.

125
00:12:43.191 --> 00:12:44.389
You return to Nottingham?

126
00:12:45.151 --> 00:12:48.271
I have a wife who waits for me.

127
00:12:49.614 --> 00:12:52.236
I have a mother that won't die

128
00:12:52.909 --> 00:12:55.031
and a brother who wishes me dead.

129
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.692
First thing I'm going to do is lock them up.

130
00:12:57.788 --> 00:13:00.458
Your people will rejoice
to see you return home.

131
00:13:00.542 --> 00:13:03.114
And that is a condition
I would like to keep them in.

132
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.204
To be remembered as I was.

133
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.419
My army knows better.

134
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.501
Lion Heart is mangy.

135
00:13:14.138 --> 00:13:18.219
Every man in that army idolises you,
Your Majesty.

136
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.101
Don't mollycoddle me.

137
00:13:21.229 --> 00:13:24.764
I understand how difficult it must be
to befriend a king.

138
00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:29.399
Come on, Loxley.
Let us find some ruffians, drink and laugh.

139
00:13:30.322 --> 00:13:32.991
Let us see if we can find an honest man.

140
00:13:33.074 --> 00:13:34.189
Yes.

141
00:13:35.243 --> 00:13:36.274
Let's do that.

142
00:13:47.422 --> 00:13:50.256
Well, that's the thing, little man.
This is not a game of luck.

143
00:13:50.341 --> 00:13:53.674
It's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.

144
00:13:53.762 --> 00:13:57.593
I've got a quick eye. I'll be watching you.

145
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:11.728
Three choices.

146
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.110
Right, left, or middle.

147
00:14:15.617 --> 00:14:18.071
I think I'll take a fourth choice.

148
00:14:19.037 --> 00:14:21.028
- A fourth?
- Hmm.

149
00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:24.205
I've been watching you
for a while now, Longstride.

150
00:14:24.291 --> 00:14:26.616
There is no pea.

151
00:14:27.836 --> 00:14:30.042
This game is a trick!

152
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:34.258
You take out the pea when you're doing
your slidings and your turnings.

153
00:14:34.342 --> 00:14:35.623
I got you.

154
00:14:40.807 --> 00:14:42.634
Don't touch it again.

155
00:14:43.518 --> 00:14:44.894
I'll do it!

156
00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.203
You lose.

157
00:15:26.186 --> 00:15:27.811
You're doing better than you think.

158
00:15:27.896 --> 00:15:29.640
Get in there, Robin.

159
00:15:39.031 --> 00:15:41.819
Kneel, you ignorant bastards!

160
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.737
Kneel before the King!

161
00:15:46.289 --> 00:15:47.949
All of you, move back, now.

162
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.120
No, no, Loxley.
These men are soldiers at play.

163
00:15:52.212 --> 00:15:54.370
Sinners after mine own heart.

164
00:15:55.215 --> 00:15:57.706
Which one of you started the fight?

165
00:16:00.053 --> 00:16:01.428
I did, Sire.

166
00:16:02.806 --> 00:16:04.882
I threw the first punch.

167
00:16:04.974 --> 00:16:06.303
Ah, honest man.

168
00:16:07.268 --> 00:16:08.549
And who're you fighting?

169
00:16:09.854 --> 00:16:12.690
He was fighting me, Your Majesty.

170
00:16:12.775 --> 00:16:14.898
I thought him to be a lesser man.

171
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.443
He was showing me different.

172
00:16:19.156 --> 00:16:21.481
An enemy that shows his respect.

173
00:16:22.076 --> 00:16:24.364
Stand up, the pair of you.

174
00:16:24.452 --> 00:16:25.697
Not you.

175
00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:33.294
Brave and honest.

176
00:16:34.713 --> 00:16:39.375
Are you honest enough to tell a king
something that he does not want to hear?

177
00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:42.250
What is your opinion on my crusade?

178
00:16:44.597 --> 00:16:47.883
Will God be pleased with my sacrifice?

179
00:16:57.402 --> 00:16:58.861
No, he won't.

180
00:17:00.655 --> 00:17:02.398
Why do you say that?

181
00:17:03.241 --> 00:17:05.364
The massacre at Acre, Sire.

182
00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:07.614
Speak up!

183
00:17:09.581 --> 00:17:14.077
When you had us herd 2,500 Muslim men,
women, and children together,

184
00:17:14.168 --> 00:17:18.415
the young woman at my feet,
with her hands bound, she looked up at me.

185
00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:22.507
There wasn't fear in her eyes.
There wasn't anger.

186
00:17:23.428 --> 00:17:25.219
There was only pity.

187
00:17:27.764 --> 00:17:30.600
For she knew that when you gave the order

188
00:17:31.602 --> 00:17:34.687
and our blades
would descend upon their heads,

189
00:17:35.148 --> 00:17:37.899
that, in that moment, we would be godless.

190
00:17:38.694 --> 00:17:40.021
All of us.

191
00:17:42.406 --> 00:17:43.604
Godless.

192
00:17:48.287 --> 00:17:49.448
Honest,

193
00:17:50.788 --> 00:17:51.867
brave

194
00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:54.452
and naïve.

195
00:17:56.627 --> 00:17:58.787
There is your Englishman.

196
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.291
Right there.

197
00:18:03.634 --> 00:18:06.043
- Well done, Robin.
- You showed him.

198
00:18:06.512 --> 00:18:08.006
The whipping will be the worst of it.

199
00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.467
The branding iron, that will be the worst.

200
00:18:09.558 --> 00:18:10.756
Unless they hang us.

201
00:18:10.851 --> 00:18:13.389
No. No, this will be the worst of it.

202
00:18:13.477 --> 00:18:17.806
And this will be the end of it.
As soon as I get out of here, I'm gone.

203
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.105
I don't owe God or any other man here
one more minute of service.

204
00:19:23.088 --> 00:19:25.924
We go all the way back to the same breast.

205
00:19:28.219 --> 00:19:29.464
Wet nurse.

206
00:19:29.553 --> 00:19:30.716
Indeed.

207
00:19:32.514 --> 00:19:33.676
We've been close ever since.

208
00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:36.923
Good.

209
00:19:39.355 --> 00:19:42.558
Because England, under your friend John,

210
00:19:44.068 --> 00:19:46.689
is a country with no fighting spirit.

211
00:19:47.404 --> 00:19:50.108
I can take London with an army of cooks.

212
00:19:50.949 --> 00:19:53.237
But Richard is on his way home.

213
00:19:53.952 --> 00:19:58.116
And under Richard,
England is a different animal altogether.

214
00:19:58.957 --> 00:20:02.373
Richard will return home
through the Forest of Broceliande.

215
00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:05.413
We know the exact place.

216
00:20:05.922 --> 00:20:11.877
He always travels ahead of his army
with only a few trusted knights around him.

217
00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.391
With Richard dead, it will be easy for you
to turn the country against John.

218
00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:20.509
There'll never be a better moment to invade.

219
00:20:25.066 --> 00:20:27.604
Even dying animals can be obstinate.

220
00:20:30.656 --> 00:20:33.610
Kill the Lion Heart
and you will be richly rewarded.

221
00:20:52.301 --> 00:20:53.465
Heave!

222
00:20:54.805 --> 00:20:55.967
Heave!

223
00:21:12.531 --> 00:21:13.692
Heave!

224
00:21:14.699 --> 00:21:16.324
For England!

225
00:21:21.038 --> 00:21:22.450
For England!

226
00:21:32.174 --> 00:21:33.834
I need a physician here!

227
00:21:33.927 --> 00:21:35.883
A physician! Quickly!

228
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.677
Give us cover! Give us cover, now!

229
00:21:41.058 --> 00:21:42.089
Cover him!

230
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.599
Cover the King.

231
00:21:45.395 --> 00:21:47.637
Physician!

232
00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.234
Why, Loxley? Are you not feeling well?

233
00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:52.400
Physician!

234
00:21:58.826 --> 00:21:59.907
Wine.

235
00:22:23.017 --> 00:22:24.392
What's this?

236
00:22:25.561 --> 00:22:27.719
- The King is dead!
- Dead?

237
00:22:28.564 --> 00:22:29.643
Dead.

238
00:22:30.024 --> 00:22:34.686
All right, then, Jimmy. Knock the pegs out.
We make our own fate from now on!

239
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.569
I'll come with you.

240
00:22:39.659 --> 00:22:42.576
No, you're not. We don't take strays.

241
00:22:42.662 --> 00:22:43.692
The more the merrier.

242
00:22:43.787 --> 00:22:45.614
The road will be dangerous.
He might be useful.

243
00:22:45.706 --> 00:22:46.785
Where we going?

244
00:22:46.874 --> 00:22:50.492
To the coast and to a boat
before 3,000 desperate soldiers get there

245
00:22:50.586 --> 00:22:52.958
and the price for a Channel crossing
goes up a hundredfold.

246
00:22:53.047 --> 00:22:54.422
What about our wages?

247
00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:57.543
If you thought it was hard getting wages
while he was alive,

248
00:22:57.634 --> 00:22:59.460
try getting paid by a dead king.

249
00:22:59.553 --> 00:23:02.756
All right, boys,
collect your gear as quick as you can.

250
00:23:08.519 --> 00:23:10.394
I like the new church.

251
00:23:13.483 --> 00:23:14.812
Lady Marion.

252
00:23:14.901 --> 00:23:20.191
I would have been sorry to leave
without your farewell. Thank you.

253
00:23:21.283 --> 00:23:23.691
I'm glad to speed you on your way,
Father Tancred,

254
00:23:23.786 --> 00:23:27.120
but it was to seek out our new shepherd.

255
00:23:27.206 --> 00:23:31.666
You have lately been missed
at Sunday worship and my sermons.

256
00:23:32.461 --> 00:23:36.411
I like a quiet church, Father,
when I pray for a miracle.

257
00:23:43.639 --> 00:23:47.767
Your new flock is women,
children and old folk.

258
00:23:47.852 --> 00:23:49.974
Our men have gone to war
or returned broken.

259
00:23:50.437 --> 00:23:53.142
Their orphans run wild in the greenwood.

260
00:23:56.693 --> 00:23:59.979
Our fields are ready for planting
but we've no seed corn.

261
00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:03.192
And the church barn is full of grain.

262
00:24:03.283 --> 00:24:05.904
Surely, you do not expect the church

263
00:24:05.994 --> 00:24:08.912
to let its corn be used to plant your fields?

264
00:24:08.997 --> 00:24:11.784
That grain is bound for York.

265
00:24:13.001 --> 00:24:14.626
I am Friar Tuck.

266
00:24:15.337 --> 00:24:17.163
Father Tancred is elevated to York

267
00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:20.007
where I know he will remind the Bishop
that the people of Nottingham...

268
00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:23.840
The Bishop does not need reminding
that the people of Nottingham

269
00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:28.009
should reap what they sow
and repent of their sins.

270
00:24:28.308 --> 00:24:32.306
The miracle I pray for is that
the Bishop show some Christian charity.

271
00:24:36.106 --> 00:24:39.475
As I said, Father,
I like a quiet church when I pray.

272
00:24:56.377 --> 00:24:59.664
You will have trouble
from the Loxleys of Peper Harow.

273
00:25:03.426 --> 00:25:05.835
You keep bees, Tuck?

274
00:25:05.929 --> 00:25:08.088
I keep them and they keep me.

275
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.616
Stop!

276
00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:37.246
Ambush!

277
00:26:54.995 --> 00:26:56.157
You're a knight?

278
00:26:57.122 --> 00:26:58.996
Where is King Richard?

279
00:26:59.667 --> 00:27:00.865
Oh, God.

280
00:27:01.334 --> 00:27:02.414
Where is the King?

281
00:27:03.587 --> 00:27:05.165
- Dead.
- Dead?

282
00:27:06.423 --> 00:27:07.621
Really?

283
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.961
If the King's dead, where are you going?

284
00:27:14.515 --> 00:27:15.593
Deliver the crown.

285
00:27:17.475 --> 00:27:19.053
Richard's crown.

286
00:27:19.686 --> 00:27:20.766
Richard's crown.

287
00:27:24.608 --> 00:27:26.730
How do we assassinate a king
who's already dead?

288
00:27:35.702 --> 00:27:38.323
Bring back the crown!
Kill the horse!

289
00:27:41.958 --> 00:27:43.537
You are English.

290
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.295
When it suits me.

291
00:27:48.215 --> 00:27:49.246
Who are you?

292
00:27:50.759 --> 00:27:52.752
Robert Loxley.

293
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.562
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

294
00:28:13.532 --> 00:28:15.488
That's the King's horse.

295
00:28:20.581 --> 00:28:22.490
Jimmy! Move!

296
00:28:32.968 --> 00:28:34.083
Jimmy!

297
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:48.725
Robin, they're French.

298
00:28:48.816 --> 00:28:49.980
Ambush.

299
00:29:08.544 --> 00:29:09.623
Go.

300
00:29:47.542 --> 00:29:48.656
John.

301
00:29:50.003 --> 00:29:51.165
Don't know.

302
00:29:51.337 --> 00:29:52.665
He's dead.

303
00:29:52.838 --> 00:29:53.953
Help.

304
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:03.962
My sword.

305
00:30:14.276 --> 00:30:16.269
Its value to me is great.

306
00:30:17.529 --> 00:30:19.522
It belonged to my father,

307
00:30:20.783 --> 00:30:21.945
Sir Walter Loxley

308
00:30:23.202 --> 00:30:24.696
of Nottingham.

309
00:30:26.705 --> 00:30:28.034
Do you know it?

310
00:30:28.123 --> 00:30:30.875
Aye, I've heard of Nottingham.

311
00:30:34.505 --> 00:30:35.963
Then the fate...

312
00:30:36.048 --> 00:30:38.172
The fates have smiled on me.

313
00:30:41.471 --> 00:30:45.931
You must take the sword to my father.

314
00:30:47.143 --> 00:30:49.052
It will bring me peace.

315
00:30:52.398 --> 00:30:56.016
I took it in anger and without his consent.

316
00:30:57.444 --> 00:31:00.565
You must understand the bond of love

317
00:31:00.656 --> 00:31:02.863
between a father and his son.

318
00:31:03.326 --> 00:31:07.323
My father abandoned me to the world of men
when I was six years old.

319
00:31:07.413 --> 00:31:10.034
I know little of the love
between father and son.

320
00:31:10.708 --> 00:31:12.036
I beg you.

321
00:31:12.459 --> 00:31:14.119
Longstride,

322
00:31:14.211 --> 00:31:15.670
say you will.

323
00:31:20.717 --> 00:31:21.916
I will.

324
00:31:42.656 --> 00:31:44.779
It's a pact sworn in blood, Robin.

325
00:31:45.075 --> 00:31:48.658
It's a scratch, Allan, and that's all it is.

326
00:32:08.975 --> 00:32:10.136
Robin!

327
00:32:17.148 --> 00:32:20.315
Loxley was making for the coast
to meet the ship.

328
00:32:24.322 --> 00:32:25.982
That crown could be our passage home.

329
00:32:26.409 --> 00:32:27.903
We're common archers, Robin.

330
00:32:27.992 --> 00:32:30.828
If we arrive at the King's ship
with his crown, we'll be accused of murder.

331
00:32:31.247 --> 00:32:33.156
How do you know

332
00:32:33.249 --> 00:32:37.411
that the knights you see walking about
are actually knights at all?

333
00:32:37.503 --> 00:32:39.993
There is no difference between a knight

334
00:32:40.089 --> 00:32:43.124
and any other man
aside from what he wears.

335
00:32:44.217 --> 00:32:46.174
All we need is about us.

336
00:32:46.886 --> 00:32:50.053
Armour, helmets, swords,

337
00:32:52.016 --> 00:32:55.516
and we make England wealthy men

338
00:32:57.063 --> 00:32:59.352
with horses and gold.

339
00:33:00.234 --> 00:33:03.483
Fate has smiled upon us at last.

340
00:33:04.404 --> 00:33:07.191
And I, for one, shall not turn my back on her.

341
00:33:09.367 --> 00:33:11.858
Take that crown off your head, Will,

342
00:33:11.953 --> 00:33:13.032
and fill it to the brim.

343
00:33:18.209 --> 00:33:20.498
We commit the soul of this boy
to your keeping, Lord.

344
00:33:20.586 --> 00:33:24.169
We would ask, when he arrives
at the gates of eternity,

345
00:33:24.257 --> 00:33:25.799
if you could let him in.

346
00:33:39.647 --> 00:33:43.811
Goliath's got the soil turning nicely.
But for what?

347
00:33:44.444 --> 00:33:47.114
- Nettles?
- Nettle soup and dandelion salad,

348
00:33:47.196 --> 00:33:48.228
that'll keep us alive.

349
00:33:48.323 --> 00:33:49.402
Come, Goliath. This way.

350
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.115
Until we get a miracle.

351
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:53.154
This way.

352
00:34:00.251 --> 00:34:01.912
Marion, Sheriff.

353
00:34:08.926 --> 00:34:13.387
Marion, I've been at Peper Harow,
waiting in vain

354
00:34:13.723 --> 00:34:15.929
for Sir Walter to receive me.

355
00:34:17.768 --> 00:34:20.853
Kindly tell him I have better things to do
than haunt his threshold.

356
00:34:20.938 --> 00:34:23.607
That you have,
while robbers are roaming free in Sherwood.

357
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.933
That's sheriff's business.
Why don't you look to it?

358
00:34:26.026 --> 00:34:28.268
Tell the old fool that next time,
I'll break his door down.

359
00:34:28.487 --> 00:34:32.070
- And if he's too proud to pay...
- No, no, no, no. He's not too proud.

360
00:34:32.157 --> 00:34:33.652
He's too poor.

361
00:34:33.742 --> 00:34:36.115
In the name of King Richard,
you have stripped our wealth

362
00:34:36.203 --> 00:34:37.578
to pay for foreign adventures.

363
00:34:37.913 --> 00:34:40.368
Whilst at home, the Church,
in the name of the merciful God,

364
00:34:40.457 --> 00:34:44.870
has reaped, without mercy, the largest share
of what we had set aside to feed ourselves.

365
00:34:45.879 --> 00:34:48.452
Between a sheriff and a bishop,
I wouldn't care to judge

366
00:34:48.548 --> 00:34:50.790
who's the greater curse
on honest English folk.

367
00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:54.130
Marion,

368
00:34:54.221 --> 00:34:57.258
why, oh, why do you make an enemy of me

369
00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:59.473
when you have the means
to make me your protector?

370
00:34:59.852 --> 00:35:01.263
What means?

371
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.811
If you leave now,

372
00:35:07.984 --> 00:35:10.441
I will lengthen your life
by not telling my husband

373
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:13.067
of your visit when he returns home.

374
00:35:13.157 --> 00:35:16.028
Your husband? After 10 years?

375
00:35:17.828 --> 00:35:21.611
If he's not dead, he's rutting his way
through the brothels of the Barbary Coast.

376
00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:24.158
So speaks a man of experience.

377
00:35:24.251 --> 00:35:26.043
Well, think on it, Marion.

378
00:35:26.544 --> 00:35:29.001
Sir Walter is dying without an heir.

379
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:33.038
Peper Harow will fall to the crown,
and you will be living in the hedgerow.

380
00:35:33.344 --> 00:35:35.086
You'll be glad to come to me then.

381
00:36:09.338 --> 00:36:10.961
Captain, there.

382
00:36:30.233 --> 00:36:34.065
Sir, we were told
to expect 12 riders and the King.

383
00:36:35.072 --> 00:36:37.064
Our beloved King is dead.

384
00:36:39.117 --> 00:36:42.243
Long live the King.

385
00:36:42.746 --> 00:36:43.908
And you are, sir?

386
00:36:45.582 --> 00:36:49.995
Sir Robert Loxley of Nottingham. And you?

387
00:36:50.587 --> 00:36:52.580
I'm the King's equerry, Sir.

388
00:36:52.672 --> 00:36:56.088
Come aboard, gentlemen,
before the tide floats her. It's coming in fast.

389
00:37:07.395 --> 00:37:12.057
And it's row, me bully boys
We're in a hurry, boys

390
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:15.353
We got a long way to go

391
00:37:15.444 --> 00:37:19.359
Where we'll sing and we'll dance
And bid farewell to France

392
00:37:19.448 --> 00:37:23.398
And row, me bully boys, row

393
00:37:23.869 --> 00:37:28.448
And it's row, me bully boys
We're in a hurry boys

394
00:37:28.541 --> 00:37:31.910
We got a long way to go

395
00:37:32.002 --> 00:37:35.585
We'll sing and we'll dance
And bid farewell to France

396
00:37:35.673 --> 00:37:39.505
And row, me bully boys, row

397
00:37:45.224 --> 00:37:47.133
So what's the plan in the morning?

398
00:37:48.352 --> 00:37:51.437
The boat stops at Gravesend
on the way to London.

399
00:37:51.523 --> 00:37:54.939
We'll leave the honour of returning
the crown to them, and we'll be gone.

400
00:37:55.361 --> 00:37:56.522
Where?

401
00:37:57.404 --> 00:37:58.602
North.

402
00:37:59.989 --> 00:38:02.196
Well, that suits me.

403
00:38:02.283 --> 00:38:05.984
Row, me bully boys, row

404
00:38:06.078 --> 00:38:08.914
But now we're returning
So lock up your daughters

405
00:38:29.185 --> 00:38:32.850
We'll sing and we'll dance
And bid farewell to France

406
00:38:32.938 --> 00:38:36.853
And it's row, me bully boys, row

407
00:39:19.152 --> 00:39:22.272
Make ready, Sir Robert.
We dock in 20 minutes.

408
00:39:22.905 --> 00:39:23.985
Gravesend?

409
00:39:24.072 --> 00:39:27.488
No, My Lord.
The palace docks, Tower of London.

410
00:39:36.878 --> 00:39:37.957
Will.

411
00:39:39.504 --> 00:39:40.749
John. Allan.

412
00:39:42.466 --> 00:39:44.625
- Where are we?
- London.

413
00:39:44.926 --> 00:39:46.303
Holy Christ!

414
00:39:47.888 --> 00:39:49.761
We dock in 10 minutes.

415
00:39:50.308 --> 00:39:52.384
When this is done, be ready to ride.

416
00:39:52.476 --> 00:39:54.385
What if... What if Loxley is known

417
00:39:54.477 --> 00:39:56.554
to the King's mother or brother
or any of them?

418
00:39:56.646 --> 00:39:58.603
Then we'll be riding for our lives.

419
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:02.107
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Peter and Paul and Mary!

420
00:40:02.193 --> 00:40:03.688
I knew it! I knew it!

421
00:40:05.614 --> 00:40:06.812
Good morning, My Lord.

422
00:40:06.906 --> 00:40:10.359
Some words of advice
on this tragic occasion.

423
00:40:11.036 --> 00:40:13.705
You appreciate
everything must be done correctly,

424
00:40:14.497 --> 00:40:16.869
so you will present the crown
to Lady Eleanor.

425
00:40:16.958 --> 00:40:18.500
You will go down on the right knee.

426
00:40:18.585 --> 00:40:22.452
Do not look in her eyes
when you tell her the King is no more.

427
00:40:22.547 --> 00:40:26.295
And do not rise until all others rise.
Do you understand?

428
00:40:26.384 --> 00:40:27.463
Yes.

429
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:40.392
Agnes.

430
00:40:41.608 --> 00:40:43.233
My blue and gold brocade.

431
00:40:43.319 --> 00:40:44.433
Yes, My Lady.

432
00:41:06.299 --> 00:41:09.504
Part for the Queen.

433
00:41:34.535 --> 00:41:35.698
Cease.

434
00:41:57.475 --> 00:41:59.052
What's this? What's happening?

435
00:41:59.143 --> 00:42:01.349
King Richard returns from France, My Lord.

436
00:42:06.108 --> 00:42:07.982
Did Loxley deceive us?

437
00:42:43.146 --> 00:42:44.259
Kneel.

438
00:42:50.862 --> 00:42:52.522
Long life, my son.

439
00:42:54.115 --> 00:42:55.394
Rise now.

440
00:42:58.326 --> 00:43:01.079
A king is dead.

441
00:43:02.123 --> 00:43:04.614
Long live the King.

442
00:43:06.252 --> 00:43:08.290
Long live the King!

443
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.877
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

444
00:43:11.297 --> 00:43:13.042
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

445
00:43:13.801 --> 00:43:14.879
Rise.

446
00:43:20.056 --> 00:43:21.220
You...

447
00:43:22.851 --> 00:43:24.475
I don't know you.

448
00:43:25.145 --> 00:43:27.815
Robert Loxley, Sire, of Nottingham.

449
00:43:28.816 --> 00:43:30.309
Welcome then.

450
00:43:31.192 --> 00:43:33.315
And how did my brother die?

451
00:43:34.654 --> 00:43:36.813
In battle, Your Majesty, as was his way.

452
00:43:38.117 --> 00:43:39.492
As was his way.

453
00:43:40.327 --> 00:43:41.491
You deserve a reward...

454
00:43:41.579 --> 00:43:42.610
Let's get the horses.

455
00:43:42.705 --> 00:43:44.163
For bringing home the news.

456
00:43:46.375 --> 00:43:47.538
Kneel.

457
00:43:54.717 --> 00:43:56.460
Did you say you were from Nottingham?

458
00:43:57.886 --> 00:43:59.001
Yes.

459
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.798
Your father, Sir Walter,

460
00:44:05.269 --> 00:44:07.142
owes tax to the crown.

461
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.685
My crown.

462
00:44:11.775 --> 00:44:14.100
Tell him it's bloody expensive
running a country

463
00:44:14.194 --> 00:44:16.103
and everyone's got to pay their way.

464
00:44:16.697 --> 00:44:18.025
We'll start with this.

465
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:22.116
Make way for the King!

466
00:44:22.786 --> 00:44:23.817
Make way!

467
00:44:23.912 --> 00:44:25.027
Your Majesty.

468
00:44:25.122 --> 00:44:26.995
Make way for the King!

469
00:44:32.462 --> 00:44:34.206
- Make way!
- Godfrey.

470
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:37.759
Godfrey, my friend. It's so good to see you.

471
00:44:38.343 --> 00:44:40.252
- How were your travels?
- Good, Sire.

472
00:44:41.471 --> 00:44:42.633
What happened to your face?

473
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.598
A hunting accident. It's nothing.

474
00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:48.726
- Frightening.
- Your Majesty.

475
00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:52.262
Call it a duelling scar.
The ladies will love you all the more.

476
00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:55.265
I bow to your knowledge of the ladies, Sire.

477
00:44:59.698 --> 00:45:01.406
You can get up now.

478
00:45:09.916 --> 00:45:11.292
Sir Robert.

479
00:45:15.755 --> 00:45:19.208
You will know of me, perhaps.
I'm William Marshal.

480
00:45:20.468 --> 00:45:23.303
Your father and I were young men together.

481
00:45:23.722 --> 00:45:27.589
Tell him I'm coming to visit him soon,
on spring's first black night.

482
00:45:29.728 --> 00:45:31.601
I may have need of him.

483
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.853
I will. I'll tell him.

484
00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:39.983
Whoever he is and whatever he is,
he knows too much.

485
00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:44.491
Get rid of him.

486
00:45:57.672 --> 00:45:59.544
Come on, let's follow.

487
00:47:02.736 --> 00:47:04.444
Forfeit what you got.

488
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.567
Victuals, coin, clothing

489
00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:09.158
or your life.

490
00:47:11.036 --> 00:47:13.575
Thomas Cooper.

491
00:47:14.373 --> 00:47:15.748
Is that you?

492
00:47:20.046 --> 00:47:21.872
Are you sick, Thomas?

493
00:47:22.714 --> 00:47:24.208
We're all sick.

494
00:47:25.343 --> 00:47:28.212
- Where are the rest of you?
- Don't... Don't tell her.

495
00:47:28.303 --> 00:47:29.715
Loop will be angry.

496
00:47:29.805 --> 00:47:31.631
No, it's your mother
who's going to be angry.

497
00:47:31.723 --> 00:47:35.721
Now, either you come with me,
or I come with you.

498
00:47:35.811 --> 00:47:37.186
You choose.

499
00:47:38.396 --> 00:47:40.887
Well, come on then. Where are they?

500
00:47:42.192 --> 00:47:43.520
Answer me.

501
00:48:32.325 --> 00:48:34.995
Four men, five horses, one grey.

502
00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:37.653
- Have you seen them?
- That way.

503
00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:48.335
The living king of sermons

504
00:48:48.424 --> 00:48:50.998
Was delivered from his evil

505
00:48:52.011 --> 00:48:54.965
But he couldn't talk his last

506
00:48:55.056 --> 00:48:57.346
Because God took out his throat

507
00:48:58.519 --> 00:49:02.052
God's crossbow took out his throat

508
00:49:02.146 --> 00:49:05.515
By Christ! Can you not sing a happy tune?

509
00:49:06.025 --> 00:49:11.612
Sing a foot-stomper about adventure
and daring and courage.

510
00:49:11.697 --> 00:49:15.197
No. Sing something about a woman.

511
00:49:16.244 --> 00:49:17.868
A large woman.

512
00:49:17.953 --> 00:49:21.619
Fancy army, darling
I loves you all to bits

513
00:49:21.707 --> 00:49:24.958
I'll climb up to your chamber
And under your mountainous...

514
00:49:25.045 --> 00:49:27.618
Right. I'm done. The money's divided.

515
00:49:28.507 --> 00:49:29.917
And so should we be.

516
00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:31.498
Where will you go?

517
00:49:34.387 --> 00:49:37.388
I think something is owed
for this good fortune,

518
00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:38.968
and I mean to pay it back.

519
00:49:39.059 --> 00:49:40.221
How so?

520
00:49:41.686 --> 00:49:44.888
The inscription on the sword,
it taunts my memory.

521
00:49:45.732 --> 00:49:48.686
Maybe it's just my imagination, I don't know.

522
00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:52.235
But I intend to take that sword
back to its owner

523
00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:54.065
and fulfil the request of his dying son.

524
00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:55.320
Are you mad?

525
00:49:55.867 --> 00:49:57.906
You just said we were in danger, Robin.

526
00:49:57.994 --> 00:50:00.911
Now you choose to step back
in to harm's way?

527
00:50:01.748 --> 00:50:03.954
They're bound to go there and find you.

528
00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:08.085
We can't repay our good luck
with bad grace. It invites darkness.

529
00:50:13.091 --> 00:50:14.799
- I'm going with you.
- And I, Robin.

530
00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.505
- Yes.
- No.

531
00:50:17.804 --> 00:50:19.880
Tonight is our last in company.

532
00:50:19.973 --> 00:50:22.927
Tomorrow, we go our separate ways.

533
00:50:24.604 --> 00:50:27.439
Pack up your share. We eat and sleep.

534
00:50:28.149 --> 00:50:30.556
Will, you're on first watch.

535
00:51:32.755 --> 00:51:33.785
Will.

536
00:52:04.203 --> 00:52:05.779
Watch your step!

537
00:52:06.704 --> 00:52:07.783
One of them got away.

538
00:52:09.333 --> 00:52:11.871
Bastards! They've stolen my fortune.

539
00:52:13.337 --> 00:52:15.625
Richard's army is coming home.

540
00:52:15.713 --> 00:52:18.882
It costs money to keep it together.
Marshal, you speak for the money.

541
00:52:18.967 --> 00:52:20.130
I do, Sire.

542
00:52:20.219 --> 00:52:23.670
But to disband the army
could cost more than to keep it.

543
00:52:26.975 --> 00:52:31.305
King Richard's campaigns were costly.
And the expected returns...

544
00:52:31.396 --> 00:52:33.638
What is that to me, Marshal?

545
00:52:34.399 --> 00:52:36.890
My brother's troubles are over!

546
00:52:38.153 --> 00:52:39.777
They're over!

547
00:52:42.032 --> 00:52:43.111
Clear the room.

548
00:52:55.253 --> 00:52:57.826
So... Taxation.

549
00:52:57.922 --> 00:52:59.085
Taxation?

550
00:52:59.174 --> 00:53:03.551
Milking a dry udder gets you nothing
but kicked off the milking stool.

551
00:53:03.887 --> 00:53:05.760
Mother, spare me your farmyard memories.

552
00:53:05.847 --> 00:53:08.468
You have none,
and I don't understand them.

553
00:53:08.558 --> 00:53:10.301
These are difficult times.

554
00:53:10.602 --> 00:53:12.262
We can buy time.

555
00:53:12.353 --> 00:53:14.975
I can send envoys to secure loans.

556
00:53:15.106 --> 00:53:18.141
There are money chests from Sicily
to Normandy if you know where to look.

557
00:53:18.401 --> 00:53:20.109
Cap-in-hand to moneylenders?

558
00:53:20.611 --> 00:53:21.987
Your master's a king.

559
00:53:22.697 --> 00:53:25.022
The crown is owed money at home.

560
00:53:25.116 --> 00:53:29.326
The northern barons plead poverty,
but that's always been the song of rich men.

561
00:53:30.371 --> 00:53:32.245
So, what's to be done?

562
00:53:48.055 --> 00:53:51.093
Give me leave, Sire, to go north
with a company of mounted men.

563
00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.051
I'll have the merchants and landowners
fill your coffers

564
00:53:54.478 --> 00:53:56.104
or their coffins.

565
00:53:56.188 --> 00:53:58.561
Englishmen killing Englishmen.

566
00:53:58.649 --> 00:54:01.686
No man loyal to the crown
has anything to fear.

567
00:54:02.279 --> 00:54:07.272
And loyalty means paying your share
in the defence of the realm.

568
00:54:08.492 --> 00:54:09.986
That's well said.

569
00:54:10.995 --> 00:54:12.703
Hmm? Don't you think, Marshal?

570
00:54:14.081 --> 00:54:15.244
Mother?

571
00:54:15.332 --> 00:54:20.409
Richard commanded loyalty
not by threats but by example.

572
00:54:20.629 --> 00:54:23.666
Mother, your sainted son was an imbecile.

573
00:54:24.049 --> 00:54:29.126
And you supported his every folly
from here to Jerusalem and back.

574
00:54:29.805 --> 00:54:32.925
Yes, you worshipped him

575
00:54:33.017 --> 00:54:36.885
when the warrior lost territories
hard won by his father.

576
00:54:37.105 --> 00:54:39.181
You kissed his picture

577
00:54:39.273 --> 00:54:42.523
while England had to pay
four years' revenue

578
00:54:42.609 --> 00:54:44.317
to ransom him when he was captured.

579
00:54:44.403 --> 00:54:46.858
You are just as much to blame as anyone

580
00:54:46.947 --> 00:54:49.699
for the wreckage which is my inheritance.

581
00:55:03.338 --> 00:55:06.043
I broke her skin more than she did mine.

582
00:55:13.599 --> 00:55:14.975
Chancellor.

583
00:55:21.231 --> 00:55:22.429
Marshal,

584
00:55:24.234 --> 00:55:27.853
you served my brother faithfully
and my father before him.

585
00:55:29.407 --> 00:55:32.277
I think you've spent enough time
with my family

586
00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:34.948
and, no doubt,
would like to spend more with your own.

587
00:55:36.914 --> 00:55:39.321
Therefore, and with regret,

588
00:55:39.916 --> 00:55:43.285
I accept your resignation
of all your offices and matters of state.

589
00:55:46.716 --> 00:55:47.961
The ring.

590
00:55:56.017 --> 00:55:57.474
Your Majesty.

591
00:56:16.619 --> 00:56:20.284
Choose carefully, Godfrey, the spot
where you would place your dagger.

592
00:56:29.173 --> 00:56:31.711
For I will choose carefully, as well.

593
00:56:54.992 --> 00:56:56.534
Open the gates!

594
00:57:32.654 --> 00:57:34.029
Nottingham.

595
00:57:35.281 --> 00:57:38.068
- Is this your people, Robin?
- I don't know. Might be.

596
00:57:38.534 --> 00:57:41.903
They don't look much,
these Middle Englanders.

597
00:57:41.996 --> 00:57:44.665
Well, they've been keeping your lot
in place easy enough, haven't they?

598
00:57:44.748 --> 00:57:47.583
I hear that you Welsh boys,
you live on leeks.

599
00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.918
You co-habit with sheep.

600
00:57:52.507 --> 00:57:54.380
Bloody Scottish mule.

601
00:57:55.968 --> 00:57:59.420
You wouldn't want to annoy a bee hive
with your noise, would you?

602
00:57:59.513 --> 00:58:01.423
Your swords would be
no good then, gentlemen.

603
00:58:01.682 --> 00:58:02.762
You're the town beekeeper?

604
00:58:03.977 --> 00:58:06.847
Bless you, no. I'm the friar. Tuck's the name.

605
00:58:07.438 --> 00:58:10.854
Well, Friar Tuck, can you tell me
where I might find Sir Walter Loxley?

606
00:58:11.609 --> 00:58:13.401
If he's not up at Peper Harow...

607
00:58:15.989 --> 00:58:17.269
How long will your business take?

608
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:23.401
Stay safe.

609
00:58:24.122 --> 00:58:25.402
God be with you all.

610
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:33.745
That's it?

611
00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.250
After 10 years?

612
00:58:36.801 --> 00:58:39.755
Good Friar, where can a man get, well,

613
00:58:39.846 --> 00:58:41.884
moderately insensible
on a drink around here?

614
00:58:42.265 --> 00:58:45.431
Allan, he's a man of the cloth.
I'm sorry, Friar.

615
00:58:46.727 --> 00:58:48.934
- Have you coin?
- I have coin.

616
00:58:49.647 --> 00:58:51.022
Two pieces.

617
00:58:51.816 --> 00:58:52.930
Each.

618
00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:57.026
Have you tried the honey liquor
we call mead?

619
00:58:59.073 --> 00:59:00.532
Come with me.

620
00:59:01.199 --> 00:59:03.442
Gives a man a halo, does mead.

621
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:36.183
Girl.

622
00:59:36.277 --> 00:59:38.269
Girl?

623
00:59:42.826 --> 00:59:45.695
Either you're going blind
or you're looking for charity.

624
00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:48.154
Are you the keeper of this house?

625
00:59:48.248 --> 00:59:50.405
In a manner of speaking, yes.

626
00:59:50.834 --> 00:59:52.624
I wish to see Sir Walter Loxley.

627
00:59:55.003 --> 00:59:56.118
And you are?

628
00:59:56.463 --> 00:59:57.708
Robin Longstride.

629
00:59:57.798 --> 00:59:59.755
Plain Robin Longstride? No Sir?

630
01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.336
No, ma'am. No Sir.

631
01:00:06.056 --> 01:00:07.431
Are you here about the tax?

632
01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:12.679
No, I'm here to bring him his sword.
His son's dead.

633
01:00:14.898 --> 01:00:16.178
This way.

634
01:00:38.087 --> 01:00:39.961
He'll take your horse.

635
01:00:51.893 --> 01:00:53.091
Marion!

636
01:00:53.811 --> 01:00:55.009
Marion!

637
01:00:55.271 --> 01:00:57.478
Maggie, where is she?

638
01:00:58.734 --> 01:01:00.276
Ma'am, Sir Walter calls for you.

639
01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.768
I know, Margaret. I can hear him.

640
01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.273
Tell him we have a guest.

641
01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:18.076
I'm Marion Loxley. Robert's wife.

642
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.341
My Lady, I owe you an apology.
If I'd have known...

643
01:01:25.427 --> 01:01:28.676
Bad news is bad news
no matter how it comes.

644
01:01:29.972 --> 01:01:34.434
Indeed, I owe you thanks for taking the time
to deliver it here yourself.

645
01:01:35.228 --> 01:01:37.719
Did you fight alongside my husband?

646
01:01:39.398 --> 01:01:40.478
Yes.

647
01:01:41.859 --> 01:01:43.057
Did he die well?

648
01:01:47.323 --> 01:01:48.651
In an ambush, ma'am.

649
01:01:48.908 --> 01:01:52.241
He was the man chosen
to bring home Richard's crown.

650
01:01:52.495 --> 01:01:54.534
Marion, who is here?

651
01:01:55.915 --> 01:01:57.658
A traveller, Walter.

652
01:02:03.214 --> 01:02:05.669
This news will go very hard on him.

653
01:02:05.758 --> 01:02:06.837
Bring him in.

654
01:02:06.926 --> 01:02:08.171
Yes, yes.

655
01:02:08.719 --> 01:02:11.922
Tell him Robert is in the Holy Land,
sends his love and will return soon.

656
01:02:12.807 --> 01:02:15.380
Marion, our traveller will be thirsty.

657
01:02:16.018 --> 01:02:19.517
Travellers are always thirsty. Is that not so?

658
01:02:19.605 --> 01:02:20.720
Your name, sir?

659
01:02:21.815 --> 01:02:23.939
Longstride. Robin Longstride.

660
01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:27.686
Do you mock me?

661
01:02:29.573 --> 01:02:30.605
Sir?

662
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:33.189
Your son,

663
01:02:34.954 --> 01:02:36.746
he asked me to bring you this.

664
01:02:45.381 --> 01:02:49.711
And how does Robert defend himself
if he has no sword?

665
01:02:51.346 --> 01:02:54.215
The prodigal son will not return after all.

666
01:02:56.892 --> 01:03:01.055
So, no tears, no forgiveness from his father.

667
01:03:05.317 --> 01:03:07.108
No amends to be made.

668
01:03:15.702 --> 01:03:17.447
Did you see him die?

669
01:03:19.791 --> 01:03:22.031
I was with him when he passed.

670
01:03:23.084 --> 01:03:26.038
His final words were for the love and bond
between a father and son.

671
01:03:27.172 --> 01:03:28.584
Forgive my rudeness.

672
01:03:30.175 --> 01:03:32.881
My grief has been waiting for this day.

673
01:03:34.095 --> 01:03:37.096
So come, so that I may see you.

674
01:03:52.531 --> 01:03:54.571
Robin Longstride.

675
01:03:55.785 --> 01:03:59.118
A common enough but noble Saxon name.

676
01:04:01.457 --> 01:04:04.411
So, you will dine with us.

677
01:04:05.794 --> 01:04:08.285
But first, you must bathe, sir.

678
01:04:08.756 --> 01:04:09.835
You stink.

679
01:04:16.763 --> 01:04:22.054
I've laid out some of my husband's clothes.
I hope you don't find that too discomforting.

680
01:04:23.437 --> 01:04:24.682
My Lady,

681
01:04:27.149 --> 01:04:28.809
I'll need some help with the chain mail.

682
01:04:31.027 --> 01:04:32.308
Winifred.

683
01:04:33.905 --> 01:04:35.150
Winifred.

684
01:04:43.748 --> 01:04:47.282
The coif has a clasp at the nape of the neck.

685
01:04:56.719 --> 01:05:00.717
If you take off the coif,
you'll find lacings in the back of the tabard.

686
01:05:37.427 --> 01:05:38.838
Thank you.

687
01:05:38.928 --> 01:05:40.672
I'll have it washed.

688
01:05:58.113 --> 01:05:59.773
Marion, more wine.

689
01:06:04.621 --> 01:06:07.657
You've taken a long road to bring this to me.

690
01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:11.159
I cannot decide
whether that makes you trustworthy...

691
01:06:11.251 --> 01:06:12.830
Or manipulative.

692
01:06:13.296 --> 01:06:18.502
Marion, I'm merely trying to gauge
the quality of the man we have as our guest.

693
01:06:18.967 --> 01:06:20.461
Is he handsome?

694
01:06:21.012 --> 01:06:22.126
Yes.

695
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:27.880
In the way that yeomen sometimes are
when they are sober.

696
01:06:27.976 --> 01:06:30.848
Entertain us
with a tale of your life, sir.

697
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.231
We don't get many visitors any more.

698
01:06:34.317 --> 01:06:37.020
Except tax collectors and other beggars.

699
01:06:37.819 --> 01:06:41.106
I don't know where I'm from.
Only know where I've been.

700
01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:44.532
So, Marion,
what colour are his eyes?

701
01:06:49.665 --> 01:06:51.291
I don't yet know.

702
01:06:52.044 --> 01:06:56.669
I have a proposal for you, young man.

703
01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:01.335
You brought me this sword,
which has great meaning.

704
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:03.337
If you give me your time,

705
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:05.758
it is yours.

706
01:07:07.433 --> 01:07:10.599
I could stay for a day, or more.

707
01:07:13.314 --> 01:07:16.932
- I have a question to ask you.
And what is your question?

708
01:07:17.026 --> 01:07:20.026
The words on the hilt of the sword,
what do they mean?

709
01:07:20.988 --> 01:07:25.864
Well, I think I have much to tell you
about history. About your history.

710
01:07:33.041 --> 01:07:34.370
That's very kind.

711
01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:37.626
Well, you haven't heard the other half
of my proposal yet.

712
01:07:37.713 --> 01:07:41.710
I want you to stay in Nottingham
and, for the time being,

713
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.880
become my returned son,
and therefore Marion's spouse.

714
01:07:46.012 --> 01:07:47.210
Oh, that's enough!

715
01:07:47.305 --> 01:07:48.883
- You've had too much to drink.
- Listen. Listen. Listen.

716
01:07:48.974 --> 01:07:53.267
We both know that without a husband
you will lose this land when I die.

717
01:07:53.645 --> 01:07:55.851
Do you dispute that? Hmm?

718
01:07:55.939 --> 01:07:58.644
- No.
- No, so if I say this is my son,

719
01:07:58.733 --> 01:08:04.403
he will be seen as that.
And, so, as your husband. Huh?

720
01:08:04.489 --> 01:08:06.197
It is a fair contract.

721
01:08:06.408 --> 01:08:10.489
It is not as if I expect you
to have children or...

722
01:08:11.247 --> 01:08:15.409
No, the sword for your time, Longstride.

723
01:08:15.876 --> 01:08:17.121
Are you in agreement?

724
01:08:18.753 --> 01:08:21.588
- Yes.
Marion, go tell the staff

725
01:08:21.881 --> 01:08:26.094
that my son has arrived
and our home is now whole again.

726
01:08:27.096 --> 01:08:29.847
Tell them to ring the church bells
in celebration.

727
01:08:30.682 --> 01:08:32.556
And more wine, please.

728
01:08:42.945 --> 01:08:44.605
Hey! Hey!

729
01:08:49.742 --> 01:08:51.118
I rose up in the morning

730
01:08:51.203 --> 01:08:53.409
And I felt a dire need

731
01:08:53.497 --> 01:08:56.995
To dream away the dreary day
and down a cup of mead

732
01:08:57.083 --> 01:08:59.123
I felt the sting of honeybees

733
01:08:59.586 --> 01:09:00.914
Home brew.

734
01:09:02.255 --> 01:09:06.632
If I wasn't the village priest,
I'd try for the village drunkard.

735
01:09:08.886 --> 01:09:09.918
Oh, great.

736
01:09:10.972 --> 01:09:13.427
A man could get
very affectionate here.

737
01:09:13.516 --> 01:09:18.972
I haven't seen so many women
for so few men outside a nunnery.

738
01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:24.149
The secret to success
is never go for the prettiest one.

739
01:09:24.986 --> 01:09:27.144
Start with the homely one on the left.

740
01:09:31.158 --> 01:09:32.321
Right there.

741
01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:35.821
She's about my size.
I'm going to make her smile.

742
01:09:36.790 --> 01:09:39.161
I'm going to make you smile!

743
01:09:39.668 --> 01:09:40.746
Come over here!

744
01:09:40.918 --> 01:09:43.837
So, why do they call you Little John?

745
01:09:43.921 --> 01:09:45.203
What are you trying to get at?

746
01:09:46.258 --> 01:09:47.456
I'm proportionate.

747
01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:50.586
So roll another barrel to the bar

748
01:09:50.679 --> 01:09:54.379
And pour another cup or two
so I can soak my heart

749
01:10:43.438 --> 01:10:44.683
Stop it.

750
01:10:48.068 --> 01:10:49.443
What did I tell you?

751
01:10:59.329 --> 01:11:01.867
It seems we are to share my chamber.

752
01:11:02.834 --> 01:11:05.704
A ruse to convince the servants.

753
01:11:06.546 --> 01:11:09.582
Well, if the aim is deception,

754
01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:15.507
should you not be addressing me as
"My husband," or, "My dear"?

755
01:11:16.264 --> 01:11:18.719
Don't be ridiculous.

756
01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:24.934
Well, are you coming or not?

757
01:11:28.859 --> 01:11:30.104
Ask me nicely.

758
01:11:38.077 --> 01:11:41.825
Please, dear husband,
will you share my chamber?

759
01:12:18.658 --> 01:12:19.689
Here.

760
01:12:23.704 --> 01:12:25.496
I sleep with a dagger.

761
01:12:25.582 --> 01:12:29.497
If you so much as move to touch me,
I will sever your manhood.

762
01:12:29.587 --> 01:12:30.832
You understand?

763
01:12:31.172 --> 01:12:32.202
Thanks for the warning.

764
01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:40.382
Hello, dogs.

765
01:14:36.170 --> 01:14:37.368
Godfrey.

766
01:14:47.973 --> 01:14:49.681
Where are your men?

767
01:14:50.684 --> 01:14:51.929
They're dead, My Lord.

768
01:14:53.061 --> 01:14:54.176
And Loxley?

769
01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.642
Alive.

770
01:14:59.318 --> 01:15:00.693
Then fate has left him to me.

771
01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.037
I hear a man's steps. Good morning, my son.

772
01:15:17.878 --> 01:15:19.253
Morning, Walter.

773
01:15:20.505 --> 01:15:21.584
Father.

774
01:15:21.965 --> 01:15:23.211
Father.

775
01:15:23.926 --> 01:15:26.298
So what is it that you know of my history?

776
01:15:26.387 --> 01:15:27.667
Patience.

777
01:15:28.097 --> 01:15:31.762
You must show yourself today.
Wear your sword.

778
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:34.259
Marion.

779
01:15:35.312 --> 01:15:36.557
I'm here, Walter.

780
01:15:36.647 --> 01:15:40.597
Reacquaint your husband
with his village and his people.

781
01:15:42.486 --> 01:15:44.774
I'll see to the horses.

782
01:15:45.072 --> 01:15:46.566
I feel invigorated.

783
01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:50.156
I woke this morning with a tumescent glow.

784
01:15:50.828 --> 01:15:52.026
Eighty-four.

785
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:54.205
A miracle.

786
01:15:55.791 --> 01:15:59.409
I've always wondered
at the private conversations of men.

787
01:16:00.212 --> 01:16:01.492
Husband.

788
01:16:21.858 --> 01:16:23.685
This is rich country.

789
01:16:24.277 --> 01:16:26.270
Where's your cattle and your sheep?

790
01:16:26.363 --> 01:16:30.277
Sold, eaten, stolen, traded.
We've had seven lean years.

791
01:16:30.825 --> 01:16:33.197
Our meat now is rabbit

792
01:16:33.286 --> 01:16:35.955
or wild pig on a lucky day.

793
01:16:36.039 --> 01:16:37.318
And deer?

794
01:16:37.665 --> 01:16:41.580
If you're willing to risk your neck
to the King's executioner.

795
01:16:41.961 --> 01:16:44.631
Every deer in the land
belongs to His Majesty.

796
01:16:44.714 --> 01:16:47.466
These things are God's gifts first
before the King's possessions.

797
01:16:48.092 --> 01:16:51.876
If it's illegal for a man to fend for himself

798
01:16:51.971 --> 01:16:53.846
how then can he be a man in his own right?

799
01:16:53.933 --> 01:16:55.805
Welcome home, sir.

800
01:16:55.893 --> 01:16:59.059
Sir Robert.
Good morning, Joseph. Emma.

801
01:17:00.648 --> 01:17:04.596
Sir Walter is our Lord, and you
are Robert returned and you should act so.

802
01:17:07.321 --> 01:17:09.610
Sir Robert. You remember me?

803
01:17:09.697 --> 01:17:12.188
Tom Chamberlain. Pig farmer.

804
01:17:12.533 --> 01:17:14.075
You don't look a day older, Tom.

805
01:17:15.077 --> 01:17:16.454
Sir Robert.

806
01:17:17.079 --> 01:17:19.368
When will our young lads come back to us?

807
01:17:19.957 --> 01:17:22.876
Will you find my Jamie,
tell him to come home?

808
01:17:25.671 --> 01:17:29.503
With no work and little food,
the village boys have gone.

809
01:17:29.593 --> 01:17:31.964
- To be soldiers?
- Poachers.

810
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:38.760
Look at that, mate.

811
01:17:41.812 --> 01:17:43.520
Still here then?

812
01:17:45.483 --> 01:17:49.564
For the time being, refer to me as Sir Robert.
I'll explain later.

813
01:17:49.987 --> 01:17:53.819
My men-at-arms.
This is about as courtly as they get.

814
01:17:54.241 --> 01:17:57.657
Allan A'Dayle, Will Scarlet and Little John.

815
01:17:57.746 --> 01:17:58.859
Lady Marion.

816
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:08.706
I trust you had an historic evening.

817
01:18:09.214 --> 01:18:10.377
For sure.

818
01:18:14.970 --> 01:18:18.221
Lady Marion Loxley. My wife.

819
01:18:19.017 --> 01:18:20.476
Well played.

820
01:18:21.019 --> 01:18:24.352
A bit rash but well played nonetheless.

821
01:18:24.439 --> 01:18:26.016
Right you are, Robin.

822
01:18:26.232 --> 01:18:27.512
Sir Robert.

823
01:18:27.609 --> 01:18:29.186
- Sir Robert.
- Sir...

824
01:18:29.777 --> 01:18:31.568
- Sir.
- Sir.

825
01:18:31.654 --> 01:18:33.314
- Sir Bob.
- Sir Robert.

826
01:18:40.622 --> 01:18:41.902
Friar.

827
01:18:43.457 --> 01:18:48.120
Ah, Marion. Good news travels
from Peper Harow this morning.

828
01:18:48.921 --> 01:18:51.412
Sir Robert, nice to see you again.

829
01:18:51.507 --> 01:18:55.207
You should've made yourself known
when we met in the field. Welcome home.

830
01:18:55.928 --> 01:18:58.597
Yes, I should've. Forgive me, Friar.

831
01:18:59.807 --> 01:19:01.265
What happens here?

832
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:03.805
We're moving
the Church's grain to York.

833
01:19:03.894 --> 01:19:05.638
Politics out of London, I hear.

834
01:19:05.729 --> 01:19:08.683
This is our grain. It belongs in this soil.

835
01:19:08.774 --> 01:19:11.775
Lady Marion, I but follow the orders
of my superiors

836
01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:14.268
and abide by their saying and rule.

837
01:19:19.284 --> 01:19:21.775
Does His Holiness
know about your wealth of honey?

838
01:19:23.747 --> 01:19:27.958
There are wolves in York, Sir Robert.
Voracious wolves.

839
01:19:29.378 --> 01:19:31.086
The bees are my family.

840
01:19:31.505 --> 01:19:33.663
I'm a procreator by design.

841
01:19:34.383 --> 01:19:37.134
I'm not a churchy friar. Never was.

842
01:19:37.969 --> 01:19:39.760
My bees give life.

843
01:19:40.472 --> 01:19:42.215
They are my life, Sir Robert.

844
01:19:42.307 --> 01:19:44.181
Should not the Bishop be told

845
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:47.477
so the clergy can spread
Nottingham honey on Nottingham bread?

846
01:19:50.774 --> 01:19:53.645
What if the grain were not to reach York?

847
01:19:55.112 --> 01:19:58.481
Then the bees need not be spoken of.

848
01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:10.833
I was an old maid
when Robert courted me.

849
01:20:10.919 --> 01:20:15.249
I was a daughter of a respectable widow
with a thimbleful of noble blood.

850
01:20:15.674 --> 01:20:19.423
We were wed, and then a week later

851
01:20:19.845 --> 01:20:23.592
he left to join ship
for France and the Holy Lands.

852
01:20:23.682 --> 01:20:26.683
And that was my married life to a man

853
01:20:28.687 --> 01:20:30.395
I hardly knew.

854
01:20:33.442 --> 01:20:35.848
- A good knight.
- Short, but sweet.

855
01:20:36.945 --> 01:20:40.065
I mean, he was a good knight.

856
01:20:40.656 --> 01:20:42.650
A good knight-at-arms, a soldier.

857
01:20:42.743 --> 01:20:45.030
Oh, yes,
my knight-in-arms, even so.

858
01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:46.862
And I in his.

859
01:21:17.736 --> 01:21:20.191
Stop! You'll break its neck.

860
01:21:33.251 --> 01:21:34.496
Marion.

861
01:21:43.594 --> 01:21:44.709
Easy.

862
01:21:48.433 --> 01:21:49.631
I'm all right.

863
01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:53.811
I can't move me legs.

864
01:21:54.856 --> 01:21:56.231
I can't move me legs.

865
01:21:58.609 --> 01:21:59.854
Thank you.

866
01:22:03.113 --> 01:22:04.442
My Lord?

867
01:22:17.461 --> 01:22:19.252
Oh, is it my turn now?

868
01:22:28.472 --> 01:22:29.634
Thank you.

869
01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.138
Nicely done, sir.

870
01:22:34.228 --> 01:22:39.021
And to see Lady Marion Loxley's legs,
beyond my wildest hopes this morning.

871
01:22:41.235 --> 01:22:45.185
I don't believe you know my husband,

872
01:22:45.698 --> 01:22:46.729
Sir Robert.

873
01:22:46.824 --> 01:22:50.408
Allow me to introduce
the Sheriff of Nottingham.

874
01:22:50.495 --> 01:22:52.202
Welcome home, Sir Robert.

875
01:22:52.288 --> 01:22:56.155
You make your mark quickly
by rescuing the King's ram from drowning.

876
01:22:56.667 --> 01:22:57.699
What's this?

877
01:22:57.793 --> 01:23:02.040
What's mine in coin I have the right
to take in goods or livestock.

878
01:23:03.215 --> 01:23:05.042
If it's God's will.

879
01:23:08.637 --> 01:23:11.128
Here's a ram's worth of tax
for the Exchequer.

880
01:23:11.223 --> 01:23:15.684
Your insolence to Lady Marion,
I'll consider a debt between us.

881
01:23:41.670 --> 01:23:43.912
Mead and grain alcohol?

882
01:23:44.005 --> 01:23:46.294
I thought as much.

883
01:23:49.428 --> 01:23:51.586
There's something that we need to do.

884
01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.423
At your service.

885
01:24:05.987 --> 01:24:07.185
All right, lads.

886
01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:11.572
Should've left while you had the chance.
Something's afoot. Off we go.

887
01:24:27.173 --> 01:24:29.296
Stop. Stop the horses.

888
01:24:31.427 --> 01:24:35.093
You there! Move aside!
We're on Church business!

889
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:38.009
None shall pass

890
01:24:38.102 --> 01:24:40.722
unless they can answer the riddle.

891
01:24:41.145 --> 01:24:42.972
Moon-mad!

892
01:24:43.065 --> 01:24:46.648
And what is the riddle, you insolent wretch?

893
01:24:47.485 --> 01:24:51.981
What has 18 legs and isn't going anywhere?

894
01:24:55.034 --> 01:24:57.359
Your next move will be your last.

895
01:24:58.621 --> 01:24:59.866
Evening, friend.

896
01:25:01.916 --> 01:25:04.324
I demand to know who you are.

897
01:25:04.836 --> 01:25:05.998
We are men of the hood.

898
01:25:08.631 --> 01:25:10.173
Merry now, at your expense.

899
01:25:11.634 --> 01:25:12.962
"The Lord taketh..."

900
01:25:13.052 --> 01:25:14.427
And we shall giveth back.

901
01:25:14.513 --> 01:25:17.004
My advice is to plant it now, by moonlight.

902
01:25:17.348 --> 01:25:18.427
Why is that, good friar?

903
01:25:18.516 --> 01:25:21.600
When it sprouts,
I can claim it as a miracle from God.

904
01:25:21.686 --> 01:25:24.686
The Church in York
would never deny a miracle.

905
01:25:28.859 --> 01:25:31.612
How much further?
About 11 miles.

906
01:26:21.996 --> 01:26:24.035
I thought you had left.

907
01:26:25.082 --> 01:26:27.241
The fields have been planted.

908
01:26:28.043 --> 01:26:30.084
I didn't want to wake you.

909
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:32.289
How did you find the seed?

910
01:26:33.007 --> 01:26:35.379
If you have to ask, it's not a gift.

911
01:26:37.469 --> 01:26:38.928
Thank you.

912
01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.928
Pikemen, at the ready!

913
01:27:26.018 --> 01:27:27.347
Arms to ready!

914
01:27:27.937 --> 01:27:29.431
Prepare!

915
01:27:30.231 --> 01:27:32.722
This King John is no king of mine!

916
01:27:34.318 --> 01:27:37.153
You! Are you Baldwin? Open these gates!

917
01:27:37.238 --> 01:27:38.981
In whose name do you come against us?

918
01:27:39.073 --> 01:27:41.064
In the name of King John.

919
01:27:41.492 --> 01:27:44.030
Pay or burn.

920
01:27:44.118 --> 01:27:47.619
We have paid in money
and men for King Richard's wars!

921
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:49.953
And we have no more to give!

922
01:27:50.084 --> 01:27:51.909
- Burn it.
- Archers!

923
01:28:11.979 --> 01:28:13.177
Come on.

924
01:28:25.203 --> 01:28:26.993
My Lord, this way!

925
01:28:31.334 --> 01:28:33.325
In the name of John,

926
01:28:33.418 --> 01:28:36.586
by the Grace of God, King of England,

927
01:28:36.671 --> 01:28:42.177
let it be known to all who abide here
that a tax is warranted!

928
01:28:47.892 --> 01:28:51.176
Those persons
refusing to abide by the law

929
01:28:51.269 --> 01:28:54.685
will hereby be subject
to severe punishment.

930
01:28:59.569 --> 01:29:02.570
By order of His Majesty, King John.

931
01:29:14.084 --> 01:29:15.411
Father Tancred!

932
01:29:33.061 --> 01:29:34.389
Your Majesty.

933
01:29:37.774 --> 01:29:39.351
Your Majesty.

934
01:29:42.278 --> 01:29:45.029
I have lost the confidence of King John,

935
01:29:45.447 --> 01:29:47.239
but he may still listen to you.

936
01:29:47.324 --> 01:29:49.781
Allow me to know better, William.

937
01:29:50.036 --> 01:29:52.361
You are much wiser than your owl.

938
01:29:52.455 --> 01:29:55.576
I dare say. I've lived longer.

939
01:29:56.919 --> 01:29:58.627
Edward, take him.

940
01:29:58.711 --> 01:29:59.743
Your Majesty.

941
01:30:03.258 --> 01:30:06.591
John is no Richard, alas, Your Majesty.

942
01:30:08.763 --> 01:30:13.425
But I serve the throne,
and the throne will endure.

943
01:30:16.104 --> 01:30:19.104
Speak plainly, Marshal.
What's troubling you?

944
01:30:19.816 --> 01:30:21.808
The crown is in peril.

945
01:30:23.027 --> 01:30:26.277
Godfrey has been plotting
with Philip of France.

946
01:30:27.323 --> 01:30:29.362
French troops have already landed
on our shores,

947
01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:32.155
and they are murdering Englishmen
in the name of King John.

948
01:30:33.037 --> 01:30:37.035
The northern barons
will make civil war against the throne.

949
01:30:37.291 --> 01:30:40.624
Leaving our coast defenceless
against the invasion

950
01:30:41.337 --> 01:30:43.376
which is certainly coming.

951
01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:50.794
So it's left to John's mother to scold him
like a child and point him to his duty.

952
01:30:56.643 --> 01:31:01.186
My son has an enemy in his court
closer to him than any friend.

953
01:31:01.315 --> 01:31:04.850
An English traitor. A paid agent of France.

954
01:31:06.028 --> 01:31:09.064
Why are you telling me
when you must tell the King?

955
01:31:09.156 --> 01:31:10.567
Isabella!

956
01:31:11.657 --> 01:31:13.865
It is you who must do that.

957
01:31:14.453 --> 01:31:18.582
Tell King John that you've had word
from France, from Philip himself, if you like.

958
01:31:18.666 --> 01:31:21.833
Why not tell him the truth?
That William Marshal...

959
01:31:21.918 --> 01:31:26.580
Oh! A mother he mistrusts
bearing the word of a man in dishonour?

960
01:31:26.674 --> 01:31:27.789
No.

961
01:31:28.676 --> 01:31:33.052
If you wish to be queen,
you must save John.

962
01:31:34.599 --> 01:31:36.008
And England.

963
01:31:37.476 --> 01:31:38.675
No!

964
01:31:39.562 --> 01:31:41.352
No! No!

965
01:31:44.317 --> 01:31:47.233
Godfrey! The bloody Judas!

966
01:31:47.987 --> 01:31:50.607
By the bowels of Christ, it's a lie.

967
01:31:50.698 --> 01:31:52.488
You lie!

968
01:32:11.217 --> 01:32:13.376
I'm sorry, my love.

969
01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.354
- Sheriff.
- Up there.

970
01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:38.486
Man won't give his name.
Demands audience with the sheriff.

971
01:32:39.037 --> 01:32:40.365
Demands?

972
01:32:43.292 --> 01:32:45.368
- Go away.
- My Lord.

973
01:33:07.565 --> 01:33:10.235
Tax collections proceed apace.

974
01:33:11.194 --> 01:33:12.985
Nottingham's turn is coming.

975
01:33:13.322 --> 01:33:15.279
Good. Good.

976
01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:19.238
Tell Sir Godfrey
that the Sheriff of Nottingham is his man.

977
01:33:19.328 --> 01:33:22.079
May he put his stamp on my authority.

978
01:33:22.164 --> 01:33:26.908
I see trouble
coming from Loxley of Peper Harow.

979
01:33:27.502 --> 01:33:29.328
A blind old man gives you trouble?

980
01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.579
Aye, and his son will give more.

981
01:33:31.756 --> 01:33:35.967
The crusader, Robert Loxley,
has returned this past week.

982
01:34:13.548 --> 01:34:14.746
Marion.

983
01:35:18.487 --> 01:35:20.562
Go on! Go on.

984
01:35:26.035 --> 01:35:27.614
Has he spoken yet?

985
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:28.991
He was spying, Loop.

986
01:35:29.455 --> 01:35:30.832
Spying?

987
01:35:32.376 --> 01:35:34.831
Robert, I'm ashamed of you.

988
01:35:35.295 --> 01:35:36.625
Hello, Marion.

989
01:35:37.047 --> 01:35:38.507
I've come to save you.

990
01:35:39.758 --> 01:35:40.874
Know him?

991
01:35:41.552 --> 01:35:46.178
Boys, this is Sir Robert Loxley, my husband.

992
01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.761
Sir Robert, the runaways of Sherwood.

993
01:35:50.727 --> 01:35:52.057
Untie him.

994
01:35:52.146 --> 01:35:55.930
No, I don't think spies should be let off
so easily.

995
01:35:56.526 --> 01:35:57.900
That was unkind.

996
01:35:57.985 --> 01:35:59.776
You were a crusader?

997
01:35:59.903 --> 01:36:00.982
Yes.

998
01:36:01.071 --> 01:36:04.025
Did you hear that, boys?
You bested a crusader.

999
01:36:05.409 --> 01:36:07.697
- My men are good fighters.
- I don't know about that.

1000
01:36:07.786 --> 01:36:10.194
I think the weight of numbers
might have been in their favour.

1001
01:36:10.289 --> 01:36:12.993
But they do move silently
like the creatures of the forest.

1002
01:36:13.083 --> 01:36:15.206
But that's only a skill if you stay as a man.

1003
01:36:15.293 --> 01:36:17.370
You don't become the creatures you hunt.

1004
01:36:17.462 --> 01:36:19.751
- We're soldiers.
No, you're not.

1005
01:36:19.923 --> 01:36:22.959
Soldiers fight for a cause. What's yours?

1006
01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:28.173
You don't have one.
That makes you poachers.

1007
01:36:29.515 --> 01:36:32.885
Common thieves with a lot to learn.

1008
01:36:32.978 --> 01:36:34.057
Like what?

1009
01:36:34.146 --> 01:36:36.387
I could teach you how to tie knots.

1010
01:36:36.481 --> 01:36:39.352
I could teach you which wood to get
to make your bows stronger.

1011
01:36:39.442 --> 01:36:43.653
I could teach you how to make arrows
that fly more than 20 feet.

1012
01:36:44.071 --> 01:36:47.406
And I can help Marion to teach you
how to stay clean

1013
01:36:47.575 --> 01:36:49.533
so you won't get sick.

1014
01:36:49.995 --> 01:36:54.620
I don't know who you're fighting, son,
but it's not me. I'm not your enemy.

1015
01:36:55.542 --> 01:36:58.625
If you want to chat,
you know where to find me.

1016
01:37:12.893 --> 01:37:14.007
Wife?

1017
01:37:21.651 --> 01:37:23.145
Marshal.

1018
01:37:23.737 --> 01:37:26.109
Stand aside! Make way for the King!

1019
01:37:26.197 --> 01:37:27.691
Your Majesty.

1020
01:37:29.492 --> 01:37:32.446
What the devil are you doing here? Hmm?

1021
01:37:32.537 --> 01:37:33.616
Sire?

1022
01:37:33.706 --> 01:37:36.540
Will you keep that animal still?
What's it got, palsy?

1023
01:37:39.043 --> 01:37:41.119
Do you think I haven't noticed
how you've deserted me?

1024
01:37:41.212 --> 01:37:43.621
If Your Majesty recalls,
our last conversation...

1025
01:37:43.715 --> 01:37:45.125
At our last conversation,

1026
01:37:45.216 --> 01:37:48.466
Philip of France wasn't coming our way
with an invasion fleet.

1027
01:37:49.138 --> 01:37:50.880
Was he, Marshal?

1028
01:37:54.642 --> 01:37:56.469
My friend Godfrey

1029
01:37:57.395 --> 01:38:00.230
is not the friend I thought he was.

1030
01:38:01.023 --> 01:38:03.775
He's stirred up
the northern barons against me.

1031
01:38:04.318 --> 01:38:06.643
They come south with an army.

1032
01:38:08.322 --> 01:38:10.730
Marshal, how dare they? How dare they?

1033
01:38:10.825 --> 01:38:13.660
Sire, forgotten men are dangerous men.

1034
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:18.403
The barons need to be told

1035
01:38:18.999 --> 01:38:22.415
that when the French come,
we are all Englishmen.

1036
01:38:23.504 --> 01:38:25.746
- Fitzrobert.
- Baldwin.

1037
01:38:26.799 --> 01:38:30.133
We'll make an army of the north
and march on London.

1038
01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.843
The barons need leadership.

1039
01:38:33.138 --> 01:38:37.054
Wiser kings know
they must let men look them in the eye,

1040
01:38:37.936 --> 01:38:39.809
hear their voice.

1041
01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:44.063
Together, let us ride north to meet them.

1042
01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:49.483
They march against their king, Marshal.

1043
01:38:51.824 --> 01:38:53.319
Their king.

1044
01:38:54.786 --> 01:38:58.783
We will meet them with the pikes
of our militia in their gizzards.

1045
01:38:59.457 --> 01:39:01.699
You have lost your touch, Marshal.

1046
01:39:03.961 --> 01:39:06.334
Perhaps we'll look to the barons
without you.

1047
01:39:17.516 --> 01:39:20.682
Saddle up with a spare horse.
I leave immediately.

1048
01:39:20.770 --> 01:39:22.312
I want to know where to find Godfrey.

1049
01:39:22.396 --> 01:39:23.677
My Lord.

1050
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:41.444
- I found him, My Lord.
Where?

1051
01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:45.786
Nottingham.
In plain sight, living as Walter Loxley's son.

1052
01:39:51.675 --> 01:39:53.714
Then we go to Nottingham.

1053
01:39:54.219 --> 01:39:57.256
Take no prisoners.
Leave no stone un-scorched.

1054
01:40:00.684 --> 01:40:02.511
Take two men, four horses.

1055
01:40:02.603 --> 01:40:06.849
Ride hard for the coast, then on to Paris
and give a message to the King.

1056
01:40:24.583 --> 01:40:26.871
I'll make the place famous.

1057
01:40:30.381 --> 01:40:31.875
Come, Allan!

1058
01:40:31.965 --> 01:40:35.085
I'll get them drinking. You get them dancing!

1059
01:40:35.219 --> 01:40:36.249
All right.

1060
01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:12.374
Music, laughter,
the crackle of a bonfire and a roasting pig.

1061
01:41:12.673 --> 01:41:16.206
Life has returned.
You have returned it, Robin.

1062
01:43:16.421 --> 01:43:18.377
How did you know it was me?

1063
01:43:18.464 --> 01:43:22.046
Who else would sit by me uninvited

1064
01:43:22.843 --> 01:43:25.464
like a friend from the old days?

1065
01:43:26.013 --> 01:43:27.673
How are you, William?

1066
01:43:28.515 --> 01:43:31.350
I'm well and troubled.

1067
01:43:31.435 --> 01:43:33.891
Ah. And what brings you?

1068
01:43:34.188 --> 01:43:37.023
I'm riding on to Barnsdale tonight.

1069
01:43:37.191 --> 01:43:41.438
I've heard something of the barons' anger
against the crown's tax collector...

1070
01:43:41.528 --> 01:43:43.900
The anger has turned into action.

1071
01:43:44.072 --> 01:43:46.148
They assemble to march against the King.

1072
01:43:46.492 --> 01:43:48.864
You think you can persuade the barons
to turn back?

1073
01:43:48.952 --> 01:43:50.032
Turn back, no.

1074
01:43:51.205 --> 01:43:55.154
To join King John against a French invasion.

1075
01:43:56.376 --> 01:43:58.499
- A what?
- Help me, Walter.

1076
01:43:58.879 --> 01:44:00.787
I cannot go with you.

1077
01:44:01.757 --> 01:44:03.499
I cannot speak for this king.

1078
01:44:03.592 --> 01:44:05.169
He is the only king we have.

1079
01:44:05.259 --> 01:44:06.635
But not the only hope.

1080
01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:08.884
Explain.

1081
01:44:10.474 --> 01:44:12.715
- Marion.
- I'm here, Walter.

1082
01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:15.302
This is my old friend,
William Marshal.

1083
01:44:15.395 --> 01:44:17.886
Lady Marion Loxley, my son's wife.

1084
01:44:17.981 --> 01:44:20.816
Lady, I was glad to see Sir Robert
when he disembarked in London.

1085
01:44:20.902 --> 01:44:23.393
I think you know better, Marshal.

1086
01:44:23.488 --> 01:44:28.232
Sir William, I know,
would like to meet Robin Longstride again.

1087
01:44:39.419 --> 01:44:40.830
We've met before.

1088
01:44:40.921 --> 01:44:43.294
Yes, Sir, I know. In London.

1089
01:44:45.133 --> 01:44:47.542
No, when you were a child.

1090
01:44:49.429 --> 01:44:51.054
Hobby-horse age.

1091
01:44:51.806 --> 01:44:55.722
Sir Walter and I returned from the Holy Land
to fetch you home.

1092
01:44:56.269 --> 01:44:57.514
But you'd gone.

1093
01:44:57.604 --> 01:45:00.723
We had lost Thomas Longstride's son.

1094
01:45:03.276 --> 01:45:06.811
It was a wound that never healed.

1095
01:45:13.786 --> 01:45:16.787
You need to know what I know.

1096
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:20.708
Your father was a stonemason.

1097
01:45:21.919 --> 01:45:23.912
Is that pleasing to you?

1098
01:45:26.132 --> 01:45:28.290
Yes. It is.

1099
01:45:29.010 --> 01:45:32.176
But he was more than that.
He was a visionary.

1100
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:34.590
What did he see?

1101
01:45:35.182 --> 01:45:37.852
That kings have a need of their subjects

1102
01:45:37.935 --> 01:45:41.767
no less than their subjects
have need of kings.

1103
01:45:41.856 --> 01:45:43.517
A dangerous idea.

1104
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:47.359
Your father was a philosopher.
He had a way of speaking

1105
01:45:47.446 --> 01:45:50.564
that took you by the ears and by the heart.

1106
01:45:50.991 --> 01:45:53.860
None of these things
can be written down, Robin.

1107
01:45:53.952 --> 01:45:56.704
You must commit them to your very soul.

1108
01:45:57.455 --> 01:45:59.281
This is the science of memory.

1109
01:45:59.791 --> 01:46:05.165
"Rise and rise again
until lambs become lions."

1110
01:46:07.631 --> 01:46:12.839
Finally, hundreds listened,
thousands, who took up his call

1111
01:46:13.096 --> 01:46:16.346
for the rights of all ranks from baron to serf.

1112
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:20.970
"Rise and rise again

1113
01:46:23.231 --> 01:46:25.473
"until lambs become lions."

1114
01:46:30.571 --> 01:46:32.398
What happened to him?

1115
01:46:33.241 --> 01:46:34.949
Close your eyes.

1116
01:46:41.165 --> 01:46:45.377
...foundation is set on
the rights of liberty for all people!

1117
01:46:50.007 --> 01:46:53.423
Longstride, give up the charter
and their names!

1118
01:46:53.678 --> 01:46:55.171
You were there.

1119
01:46:55.512 --> 01:46:56.757
You saw it.

1120
01:47:00.017 --> 01:47:01.427
I will not.

1121
01:47:25.626 --> 01:47:27.002
Not dead.

1122
01:47:28.462 --> 01:47:29.743
Not now.

1123
01:47:32.633 --> 01:47:33.878
Not now.

1124
01:47:38.221 --> 01:47:41.923
Here is my copy
of the main contract.

1125
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:45.885
This charter of rights
was written by your father.

1126
01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:49.978
And here are... There are the names
of all the barons that signed the charter.

1127
01:47:50.066 --> 01:47:53.435
Fitzrobert, Baldwin, Marshal and myself.

1128
01:47:53.988 --> 01:47:57.273
What he wanted
was a charter for every man...

1129
01:47:57.365 --> 01:47:59.903
- Wait there.
To have the same rights.

1130
01:47:59.994 --> 01:48:03.113
Sir Walter? A messenger for you.

1131
01:48:03.204 --> 01:48:04.747
Bring him in.

1132
01:48:05.416 --> 01:48:07.158
Step forward, sir.

1133
01:48:08.251 --> 01:48:10.742
- My Lord.
I'm listening.

1134
01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:13.120
Peterborough's been burned
by the King's men.

1135
01:48:13.673 --> 01:48:16.508
Fitzrobert gathers an army
to slay King John in London.

1136
01:48:16.594 --> 01:48:20.092
Marshal requests your presence
at counsel in Barnsdale.

1137
01:48:21.764 --> 01:48:24.091
Wait outside, will you?

1138
01:48:25.393 --> 01:48:27.801
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

1139
01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:31.686
The time for pretence is over.

1140
01:48:32.984 --> 01:48:35.691
Now, hold me like a son.

1141
01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:44.151
Go.

1142
01:48:45.747 --> 01:48:48.665
Maggie. Where's my lady?

1143
01:48:48.792 --> 01:48:50.251
I could not find her, sir.

1144
01:49:16.277 --> 01:49:21.105
Whether we fight for our lives,
our family and our honour,

1145
01:49:21.199 --> 01:49:22.942
we must fight till the death.

1146
01:49:23.952 --> 01:49:26.787
You've spent too long in the palace, William.

1147
01:49:26.913 --> 01:49:30.246
Spending time in the palace
gives me perspective.

1148
01:49:31.376 --> 01:49:33.036
As we speak,

1149
01:49:34.128 --> 01:49:36.880
King Philip sails for our coast.

1150
01:49:37.924 --> 01:49:42.420
Godfrey and his marauders are French!

1151
01:49:44.097 --> 01:49:46.966
Every minute that we waste in disunity

1152
01:49:47.058 --> 01:49:50.308
brings closer the destruction of our country!

1153
01:49:50.770 --> 01:49:52.644
We have been bled

1154
01:49:53.272 --> 01:49:54.980
by the King long before Godfrey.

1155
01:49:56.234 --> 01:49:59.021
Go back to London and tell the King

1156
01:49:59.736 --> 01:50:03.486
that we will meet him
on a field of his choice.

1157
01:50:03.574 --> 01:50:04.950
Make way!

1158
01:50:05.035 --> 01:50:07.324
We will not fight
to save John's crown.

1159
01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:10.618
Rather let him bend the knee to us.

1160
01:50:11.666 --> 01:50:14.039
I'll give you more,
Sir Baldwin.

1161
01:50:15.504 --> 01:50:17.829
My breast for your sword point.

1162
01:50:19.549 --> 01:50:21.126
Use mine.

1163
01:50:25.263 --> 01:50:26.461
Go on.

1164
01:50:27.849 --> 01:50:29.177
No?

1165
01:50:29.559 --> 01:50:33.508
Oh, this is what you want, isn't it?
This is what he wants.

1166
01:50:33.604 --> 01:50:37.554
Fine, I'd rather give it to you
than have it taken by the French.

1167
01:50:38.526 --> 01:50:40.815
You mistake me, Sire.

1168
01:50:40.987 --> 01:50:44.854
I have no right and no ambition
to wear the crown.

1169
01:50:45.491 --> 01:50:47.982
But let the rightful wearer beware.

1170
01:50:48.411 --> 01:50:52.539
From now we will be subject only
to laws that we have a hand in making.

1171
01:50:52.623 --> 01:50:57.332
We are not sheep
to be made mutton of by your butchers.

1172
01:50:59.130 --> 01:51:02.795
Godfrey set himself to turn you against me.

1173
01:51:02.883 --> 01:51:06.050
Then he did more than was needed
to accomplish that.

1174
01:51:10.598 --> 01:51:12.758
A very important decision.

1175
01:51:13.601 --> 01:51:17.220
Don't you think that we've paid
too much taxes for far too long...

1176
01:52:25.131 --> 01:52:26.958
This is where I was born.

1177
01:52:41.106 --> 01:52:44.557
- What does it mean?
- It means never give up.

1178
01:52:46.027 --> 01:52:50.523
We will not be loyal to a crown
that robs and starves us!

1179
01:52:50.698 --> 01:52:54.114
The King must listen to what we have to say!

1180
01:52:54.202 --> 01:52:58.948
A king does not bargain for the loyalty
that every subject owes him.

1181
01:52:59.249 --> 01:53:03.792
Without loyalty there is no kingdom.
There is nothing.

1182
01:53:05.256 --> 01:53:07.414
I'm here to speak for Sir Walter Loxley.

1183
01:53:09.468 --> 01:53:11.626
Let the man speak.
Let him speak!

1184
01:53:12.763 --> 01:53:14.589
Speak! Speak!

1185
01:53:14.806 --> 01:53:16.965
Speak, if you must.

1186
01:53:18.602 --> 01:53:21.353
If you're trying to build for the future,

1187
01:53:22.063 --> 01:53:24.601
you must set your foundation strong.

1188
01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:30.862
The laws of this land
enslave people to its king,

1189
01:53:32.531 --> 01:53:36.825
a king who demands loyalty
but offers nothing in return.

1190
01:53:38.371 --> 01:53:41.242
I have marched from France

1191
01:53:41.332 --> 01:53:43.823
to Palestine and back.

1192
01:53:44.835 --> 01:53:46.211
And I know

1193
01:53:46.837 --> 01:53:50.005
in tyranny lies only failure.

1194
01:53:51.593 --> 01:53:54.130
You build a country
like you build a cathedral,

1195
01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:55.299
from the ground up.

1196
01:53:56.555 --> 01:53:58.678
Empower every man

1197
01:53:59.934 --> 01:54:01.843
and you will gain strength.

1198
01:54:01.936 --> 01:54:03.644
Hmm.

1199
01:54:03.730 --> 01:54:06.813
Well, who could object
to such reasonable words?

1200
01:54:09.235 --> 01:54:12.900
If Your Majesty were to offer justice,

1201
01:54:14.156 --> 01:54:16.612
justice in the form of a charter of liberties,

1202
01:54:17.201 --> 01:54:20.901
allowing every man to forage for his hearth,

1203
01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:25.413
to be safe from conviction without cause

1204
01:54:25.502 --> 01:54:27.210
or prison without charge,

1205
01:54:27.962 --> 01:54:32.209
to work, eat and live
on the sweat of his own brow

1206
01:54:33.134 --> 01:54:36.549
- and be as merry as he can...
- Sir, Godfrey's men are on to Nottingham.

1207
01:54:36.846 --> 01:54:39.717
...then that king would be great.

1208
01:54:40.225 --> 01:54:44.057
Not only would he receive
the loyalty of his people

1209
01:54:45.396 --> 01:54:47.188
but their love, as well.

1210
01:54:48.483 --> 01:54:51.021
So what would you have? Hmm?

1211
01:54:51.236 --> 01:54:52.979
Castle for every man?

1212
01:54:55.323 --> 01:54:57.446
Every Englishman's home is his castle.

1213
01:54:58.910 --> 01:55:01.661
What we would ask, Your Majesty,

1214
01:55:03.081 --> 01:55:04.575
is liberty.

1215
01:55:04.916 --> 01:55:07.039
Liberty by law!

1216
01:55:08.961 --> 01:55:11.334
Your Majesty, My Lords,

1217
01:55:12.048 --> 01:55:14.586
the French fleet is in the Channel.

1218
01:55:14.759 --> 01:55:19.752
Sire, you have a chance
to unify your subjects high and low.

1219
01:55:21.474 --> 01:55:23.465
It falls on your nod.

1220
01:55:23.935 --> 01:55:25.926
I only have to nod?

1221
01:55:29.981 --> 01:55:31.774
I can do better than that.

1222
01:55:34.195 --> 01:55:35.985
I give my word

1223
01:55:36.489 --> 01:55:39.607
that such a charter will be written.

1224
01:55:39.699 --> 01:55:43.115
On my mother's life, I swear it.

1225
01:55:48.124 --> 01:55:51.541
Godfrey makes for Nottingham.
I must stay with the King.

1226
01:55:51.630 --> 01:55:53.668
I will send Baldwin and Fitzrobert with you.

1227
01:55:53.756 --> 01:55:57.540
We will meet again at the White Horse
when you are finished.

1228
01:55:57.636 --> 01:56:00.635
Robin, your father was a great man.

1229
01:56:01.972 --> 01:56:04.214
And you are your father's son.

1230
01:56:15.152 --> 01:56:16.694
Maggie, who's at the house?

1231
01:56:18.363 --> 01:56:19.608
Long live the King!

1232
01:56:55.859 --> 01:56:56.973
Gentlemen.

1233
01:57:11.708 --> 01:57:13.784
I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham.

1234
01:57:18.882 --> 01:57:20.755
I'm French on my mother's side.

1235
01:57:41.946 --> 01:57:44.864
Sir Walter! Sir Walter!

1236
01:57:53.041 --> 01:57:54.321
Loxley!

1237
01:57:54.584 --> 01:57:56.244
Show yourself!

1238
01:57:58.379 --> 01:57:59.624
Loxley!

1239
01:58:02.592 --> 01:58:04.050
Who calls here?

1240
01:58:04.552 --> 01:58:06.508
I call for Robert Loxley.

1241
01:58:06.763 --> 01:58:08.720
My son is not here to answer you.

1242
01:58:08.806 --> 01:58:10.265
That is the truth.

1243
01:58:10.516 --> 01:58:12.343
Because he's dead in a French ditch.

1244
01:58:14.479 --> 01:58:16.021
And who are you, sir, to say so?

1245
01:58:17.732 --> 01:58:19.274
Who am I?

1246
01:58:27.867 --> 01:58:29.741
I'm the one who killed him.

1247
01:58:31.536 --> 01:58:33.281
Fight me if you dare.

1248
01:58:34.123 --> 01:58:35.582
Lord have mercy.

1249
01:59:24.007 --> 01:59:26.045
Leave it on the table. Leave it! Next!

1250
01:59:27.010 --> 01:59:28.670
Next! Come on!

1251
01:59:30.512 --> 01:59:32.172
- Name?
- Loxley.

1252
01:59:32.639 --> 01:59:34.217
Christian name?

1253
01:59:34.516 --> 01:59:35.927
Marion.

1254
01:59:36.768 --> 01:59:38.476
Land?

1255
01:59:38.645 --> 01:59:40.389
5,000 acres.

1256
01:59:41.441 --> 01:59:43.183
Lady Marion Loxley?

1257
01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:45.478
I am.

1258
02:00:14.682 --> 02:00:17.766
Gentlemen, enjoy!

1259
02:00:51.218 --> 02:00:53.294
No one should have 4,000 acres.

1260
02:00:53.386 --> 02:00:55.379
5,000 acres.

1261
02:02:33.610 --> 02:02:35.651
Baldwin! Fitzrobert!

1262
02:02:35.737 --> 02:02:38.312
Take the southern flank
and circle in from the west.

1263
02:02:38.825 --> 02:02:41.575
Will and Allan,
get on the rooftops and pick your targets.

1264
02:03:02.765 --> 02:03:04.176
Lady Marion.

1265
02:03:25.663 --> 02:03:26.742
Quickly.

1266
02:03:53.106 --> 02:03:54.565
Follow me.

1267
02:04:16.504 --> 02:04:20.751
Somebody, please take the baby!
Save the baby, please!

1268
02:04:30.186 --> 02:04:31.810
John, down!

1269
02:04:38.027 --> 02:04:39.225
It's all right.

1270
02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:40.482
Go around.

1271
02:04:40.570 --> 02:04:41.816
Stand back!

1272
02:04:43.615 --> 02:04:44.695
Make way!

1273
02:04:45.784 --> 02:04:49.912
Hurry. It's all right. It's all right.
Please, hurry! Hurry!

1274
02:05:01.592 --> 02:05:02.706
Sword!

1275
02:05:22.487 --> 02:05:24.563
Get down,
you bastard French dogs!

1276
02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:18.081
Where will King Philip land
and when?

1277
02:06:31.932 --> 02:06:33.889
This is my last arrow.

1278
02:06:35.769 --> 02:06:39.433
Dungeness! Dungeness. Two days.

1279
02:06:43.442 --> 02:06:45.980
There we have it. We have two days.

1280
02:08:12.614 --> 02:08:15.864
Once before I said goodbye
to a man going to war.

1281
02:08:16.159 --> 02:08:17.951
He never came back.

1282
02:08:23.875 --> 02:08:25.619
Ask me nicely.

1283
02:09:00.329 --> 02:09:01.788
I love you, Marion.

1284
02:11:26.474 --> 02:11:27.967
Longstride!

1285
02:11:58.923 --> 02:12:01.081
What news of Walter and Nottingham?

1286
02:12:02.009 --> 02:12:04.630
Sir Walter is dead. Godfrey's hand.

1287
02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:07.425
Gentlemen, we go to war.

1288
02:12:07.681 --> 02:12:11.181
It is my first time. I shall lead.

1289
02:12:11.268 --> 02:12:12.513
Forward!

1290
02:13:52.618 --> 02:13:54.362
That's a lot of French.

1291
02:13:56.622 --> 02:13:58.200
What's to be done?

1292
02:13:59.625 --> 02:14:01.167
Archers to the cliff top.

1293
02:14:01.752 --> 02:14:04.374
Cavalry to the beach. We'll await you there.

1294
02:14:04.797 --> 02:14:06.920
- With me!
- Archers!

1295
02:14:09.385 --> 02:14:11.176
Excellent plan.

1296
02:14:32.867 --> 02:14:34.065
Cavalry!

1297
02:14:46.339 --> 02:14:47.749
Ready!

1298
02:15:07.359 --> 02:15:10.111
Raise arrows!
Raise arrows!

1299
02:15:11.197 --> 02:15:12.228
Ready!

1300
02:15:15.951 --> 02:15:17.860
Raise arrows!

1301
02:15:18.245 --> 02:15:20.119
Release! Release!

1302
02:15:32.676 --> 02:15:33.707
Release!

1303
02:16:10.881 --> 02:16:12.126
For the love of God, Marion!

1304
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:17.799
Loxley,

1305
02:16:18.139 --> 02:16:21.093
circle your troops and then join the charge.

1306
02:16:26.230 --> 02:16:27.309
With me!

1307
02:16:32.236 --> 02:16:33.515
Release!

1308
02:16:44.540 --> 02:16:45.619
Release!

1309
02:17:33.214 --> 02:17:35.371
Forward!

1310
02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:54.977
Archers, forward!

1311
02:18:22.052 --> 02:18:23.844
Let's go, Marshal.

1312
02:18:23.929 --> 02:18:25.423
We're close enough, Sire.

1313
02:18:26.099 --> 02:18:27.925
This was not
close enough for Richard.

1314
02:18:28.017 --> 02:18:29.843
And look what happened to him.

1315
02:18:30.894 --> 02:18:32.305
Forward!

1316
02:18:32.814 --> 02:18:34.355
Protect the King!

1317
02:19:05.596 --> 02:19:07.389
This is for you, Walter.

1318
02:19:20.486 --> 02:19:23.487
No!

1319
02:19:30.788 --> 02:19:32.033
Marion!

1320
02:21:15.433 --> 02:21:16.892
Marion!

1321
02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:45.618
Surrender!

1322
02:22:08.611 --> 02:22:10.770
Sire! Sire!

1323
02:22:10.906 --> 02:22:12.982
They've surrendered, Sire!

1324
02:22:13.324 --> 02:22:15.482
Yes! To whom?

1325
02:22:19.498 --> 02:22:20.528
To him.

1326
02:22:20.624 --> 02:22:22.497
Longstride!

1327
02:22:24.168 --> 02:22:25.912
Longstride!

1328
02:22:33.969 --> 02:22:36.211
Longstride!

1329
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:39.175
Longstride!

1330
02:23:17.055 --> 02:23:19.676
I did not make myself king.

1331
02:23:22.101 --> 02:23:23.512
God did.

1332
02:23:24.395 --> 02:23:26.388
King by divine right.

1333
02:23:27.690 --> 02:23:30.940
Now you come to me with this document

1334
02:23:32.487 --> 02:23:36.354
seeking to limit the authority
given to me by God!

1335
02:23:36.449 --> 02:23:38.940
Sire, you gave your word!

1336
02:23:39.035 --> 02:23:40.114
No.

1337
02:23:40.201 --> 02:23:44.070
- Sire, you give us our word, Sire!
- Did I command you to speak, sir?

1338
02:23:44.290 --> 02:23:46.615
- John...
- Or you, madam?

1339
02:23:46.709 --> 02:23:48.785
Sire, we looked to you!

1340
02:23:48.878 --> 02:23:52.081
Look to your estates, instead.

1341
02:23:55.134 --> 02:23:56.508
Archers!

1342
02:23:57.136 --> 02:24:00.256
You are fortunate
that I am in a merciful mood.

1343
02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:05.809
But as for Robin Longstride,
that mason's son,

1344
02:24:06.979 --> 02:24:11.307
for the crimes of theft
and incitement to cause unrest,

1345
02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:15.694
who pretended to be a knight of the realm,
a crime punishable by death,

1346
02:24:15.778 --> 02:24:20.690
I declare him,
from this day forth, to be an outlaw!

1347
02:24:22.619 --> 02:24:26.237
To be hunted all the days of his life...

1348
02:24:26.331 --> 02:24:30.375
- We will not stand for this!
... until his corpse, unburied, is carrion

1349
02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:33.164
for foxes and crows!

1350
02:24:56.236 --> 02:24:58.193
Hear me! Hear me!

1351
02:25:01.199 --> 02:25:02.859
By royal decree,

1352
02:25:03.452 --> 02:25:06.951
Robin Longstride,
also known as Robin of the Hood,

1353
02:25:07.247 --> 02:25:10.367
and all who shelter him or aid him

1354
02:25:10.459 --> 02:25:12.119
are declared outlaws of the realm,

1355
02:25:13.336 --> 02:25:14.960
Their properties forfeit,

1356
02:25:15.047 --> 02:25:19.209
and their lives shall be taken
by any Englishman on sight.

1357
02:25:25.140 --> 02:25:27.845
A nail please? And a hammer.

1358
02:25:28.559 --> 02:25:29.805
A nail!

1359
02:26:20.778 --> 02:26:23.067
Off you go. Come on.

1360
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:25.153
Hey, boys.

1361
02:26:25.241 --> 02:26:27.198
- You've been practising tying your knots?
- Yes.

1362
02:26:27.285 --> 02:26:29.113
Have you been shooting
your bow and arrows?

1363
02:26:29.203 --> 02:26:30.781
Who hit something? Anyone?

1364
02:26:30.872 --> 02:26:33.659
The greenwood is the outlaw's friend.

1365
02:26:33.791 --> 02:26:36.496
Now, the orphan boys make us welcome.

1366
02:26:37.420 --> 02:26:38.795
No tax, no tithe.

1367
02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:43.292
Nobody rich, nobody poor.
Fair shares for all at nature's table.

1368
02:26:43.634 --> 02:26:47.762
Many wrongs to be righted
in the country of King John.

1369
02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:53.258
Watch over us, Walter.
