Simon! Simon,
I got your breakfast.

16
00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.612
- <i>(Knocking)</i>
- Simon, you up?

17
00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:20.908
Give me a couple of minutes.

18
00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:23.704
<i>(Pounding)</i> Simon Boggs,
there are children in Mexico...

19
00:01:23.746 --> 00:01:27.084
who've already been up for three hours
making clothes for corporate America.

20
00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:30.506
- Leave me alone.
- That's it. I'm spitting in your juice.

21
00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:34.846
- <i>(Hocking)</i>
- <i>(Groaning)</i>

22
00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:38.059
I got a big loogie,
and I'll spit it right in your juice.

23
00:01:38.142 --> 00:01:40.563
<i>(Hocking)</i>

24
00:01:42.148 --> 00:01:44.736
<i>(Sucks up saliva)</i>
Good morning.

25
00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.906
Good morning, Laney.

26
00:01:53.374 --> 00:01:56.588
<i>(Boy on radio) Yeah, yeah, yeah,
earthquakes, Spring Break is officially over.</i>

27
00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:59.634
<i>Only two months left at Harrison High
until summer vacation.</i>

28
00:01:59.717 --> 00:02:03.089
<i>Until then, here's a little
welcome back music.</i>

29
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:15.867
Okay, I got a pump replacement
this afternoon out in Manhattan Beach...

30
00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.372
...so I'll try not to be late
picking you guys up.

31
00:02:18.913 --> 00:02:20.758
- Laney?
- Got it, Dad.

32
00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:24.128
Okay, have a good day, pumpkin-nose.

33
00:02:42.364 --> 00:02:44.660
<i>(Girls giggling)</i>

34
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.566
<i>(Girl #1) I know.</i>

35
00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:51.787
- <i>(Girl #2) Hey, Zack.</i>
- Hey.

36
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.382
- <i>(Girl #3) Hi.</i>
- Hello.

37
00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:59.214
What's happening, Connie?

38
00:02:59.256 --> 00:03:01.117
He spoke to me.

39
00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.687
- He called you Connie.
- So?

40
00:03:03.813 --> 00:03:05.299
Your name is Melissa.

41
00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:10.323
- Hey, Jesse.
- Hey, Laney.

42
00:03:10.407 --> 00:03:14.078
See that <i>Dateline</i> on sewage dumpers
last night? I taped it.

43
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.416
What happened to dropping
ten pounds before graduation?

44
00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:17.016
I'm looking into it.

45
00:03:17.058 --> 00:03:19.629
- Jesse, do not eat that.
- Twinkie Lite, see?

46
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.091
- Hey, yo!
- Hey, what's up, Siler?

47
00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:25.679
- What's up, Preston?
- What's up, bitch?

48
00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:28.000
How's it going, man?
Hey, guys, check it.

49
00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.785
Guess who jammed
a 30-year-old flight attendant...

50
00:03:29.852 --> 00:03:32.132
at 25,000 feet en route to Cancun?

51
00:03:32.157 --> 00:03:35.035
- Bullshit.
- I swear to God.

52
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.538
Come on, man. How was Vail?

53
00:03:36.563 --> 00:03:40.409
Fine. You know, skiing with
my parents, whatever. It was cool.

54
00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:41.612
Cool?

55
00:03:42.537 --> 00:03:47.211
Has it occurred to anyone that we have
eight weeks left in our high school careers?

56
00:03:47.253 --> 00:03:49.590
Shit. Only like every five minutes.

57
00:03:49.673 --> 00:03:51.293
- Well, it's weird, you know?
- No.

58
00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:53.497
See, I'm driving through the gate
this morning, and it hit me.

59
00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.895
Suddenly tomorrow is not just tomorrow.
It's like the future, you know?

60
00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:01.733
- No.
- Hey, guys, check it.

61
00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:05.614
Then could I please speak to somebody
who <i>doesn't</i> have his head up his ass?

62
00:04:05.655 --> 00:04:08.109
Well, well, well, check
who's back from spring break

63
00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:10.112
looking all fine and shit.

64
00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:12.703
Look, Dean, on behalf of
every black person, shut up.

65
00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:15.913
- Scusi! On the phone here.
- How you doing, baby?

66
00:04:15.938 --> 00:04:18.016
Yes, I'll hold. Get off me.

67
00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.194
Hey, you guys seen Taylor?

68
00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:22.889
Um... no.

69
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:27.104
- What?
- Taylor? My girlfriend?

70
00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:28.507
Yeah, come on, you know.

71
00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:32.654
- Tall, kind of yells at everybody.
- No. Why?

72
00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:35.659
Why? Uh, I don't know.

73
00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.780
Maybe because I haven't spoken to her
since you guys left for Daytona.

74
00:04:38.784 --> 00:04:41.083
Excuse me.

75
00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:44.130
- Hey, party people.
- Hi, Taylor.

76
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:46.341
Oh, my gosh, I've got total Diet Coke mouth.

77
00:04:46.425 --> 00:04:49.606
- Does anybody have any gum?
- <i>(Girls) I got it. Me too. Here.</i>

78
00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:52.452
<i>(Bell rings)</i>

79
00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:00.121
Listen, Zack, I've been
doing some thinking.

80
00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:04.744
I'm sorry. This?
It just isn't working for me anymore.

81
00:05:09.334 --> 00:05:11.212
New tattoo?

82
00:05:14.049 --> 00:05:15.927
Damn.

83
00:05:16.052 --> 00:05:20.851
So you show up after a week with
a tattoo and suddenly want to break up?

84
00:05:20.893 --> 00:05:23.397
What happened in Florida, Taylor?

85
00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:26.443
Look, if you want to
torture yourself...

86
00:05:28.237 --> 00:05:30.024
Oh, whatever. Okay.

87
00:05:30.107 --> 00:05:33.012
So we're at this club one night
and Chandler gets totally ploughed,

88
00:05:33.012 --> 00:05:36.417
and she starts making out with this old guy
for, like, 20 minutes on the dance floor.

89
00:05:36.484 --> 00:05:42.217
Well, imagine our surprise when this old guy
turns out to be Warren G.'s hairdresser.

90
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.920
- Isn't he gay?
- Whatever.

91
00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:47.450
So he sets us up with passes to
the spring break beach house, so we go.

92
00:05:48.192 --> 00:05:50.947
<i>(Deejay) Hey, hey.
What's up? How's it going?</i>

93
00:05:50.988 --> 00:05:54.728
<i>Welcome to spring break, live from
the beach house of Daytona, Florida.</i>

94
00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:56.231
<i>Beautiful weather, slamming bands,</i>

95
00:05:56.272 --> 00:06:00.807
<i>and, of course, 300 relative strangers from
all around this great nation of ours.</i>

96
00:06:00.812 --> 00:06:04.660
<i>Cutting loose, ha ha ha, half naked...</i>

97
00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:07.971
<i>and generally having a good time. Uh!</i>

98
00:06:09.358 --> 00:06:13.401
<i>(Taylor) The next thing I know,
Taylor Vaughan is handpicked by the director</i>

99
00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:16.894
- <i>to dance on her very own raft.
- (Partier) Hey!</i>

100
00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:26.134
This is all fascinating, Taylor,

101
00:06:26.217 --> 00:06:29.905
but, uh, could you maybe skip to the
part where you decide to screw me over?

102
00:06:29.947 --> 00:06:31.708
Hold on.
I'm getting there. Okay.

103
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.331
So I've been dancing for maybe
five minutes, right? And I nearly fell off,

104
00:06:35.373 --> 00:06:39.119
which would have been so embarrassing,
and, you know, being on cable and everything.

105
00:06:39.144 --> 00:06:42.432
So I turn around to see what I've hit,
and <i>that's</i> when it happened.

106
00:06:42.474 --> 00:06:46.855
Hey, I'm Brock Hudson! Hey!

107
00:06:46.897 --> 00:06:49.860
Brock Hudson?
What kind of a name is that?

108
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:53.159
What kind of name is Zack?
Okay, Brock is from <i>The Real World.</i>

109
00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:54.459
What, like Reseda?

110
00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:59.082
No, like the TV show, okay?
<i>Real World, L.A.</i> Second season. Hello.

111
00:07:00.368 --> 00:07:02.754
The dyslexic volleyball guy?

112
00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.424
They kicked him out of the house.

113
00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:07.219
The next three days
were kind of a blur.

114
00:07:09.344 --> 00:07:12.143
I mean, it was like we had known
each other for weeks.

115
00:07:12.227 --> 00:07:16.149
He knew exactly what I was thinking,
and I didn't even have to say a word.

116
00:07:18.144 --> 00:07:21.365
So before I left, Brock said
he had a surprise for me...

117
00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:24.954
Something to record the wonderment
of our first days together.

118
00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:27.125
- <i>(Moaning)</i>
- <i>(Whirring)</i>

119
00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:29.562
- So that's it?
- Pretty much, yeah.

120
00:07:29.745 --> 00:07:32.116
Oh, but don't worry, Zack. I mean,
I'll still go to the prom with you.

121
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:37.064
I mean, we're going to be elected. It's only
appropriate for the king and queen to go together.

122
00:07:38.766 --> 00:07:40.853
I-- I don't know what to say.

123
00:07:40.936 --> 00:07:43.157
Oh, so don't then, Zack.
I mean, it's been fun.

124
00:07:43.198 --> 00:07:47.822
But did you honestly think that I was going
to leave for college still dating you?

125
00:07:47.863 --> 00:07:49.908
Oh, my God, you did.

126
00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:54.081
No way. That is so sweet. Ow!

127
00:07:54.164 --> 00:07:56.919
Do you believe
this thing still hurts?

128
00:08:00.841 --> 00:08:03.220
<i>(Students suddenly start chattering)</i>

129
00:08:05.056 --> 00:08:07.184
Great.

130
00:08:09.896 --> 00:08:13.026
That's a very nice use
of color, Misty.

131
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.229
Thanks.

132
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:24.419
I read about this riot
in Mogadishu.

133
00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:29.551
- This represents the pain of that night.
- <i>That's wonderful, Laney.</i>

134
00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.679
But tell me something.

135
00:08:31.762 --> 00:08:34.725
Which part represents you?

136
00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:44.031
Laney,

137
00:08:44.673 --> 00:08:47.161
Savannah and I were just talking
about your stuff.

138
00:08:47.244 --> 00:08:52.252
Just about how you're not--
I don't know, you're not afraid to be dark.

139
00:08:52.377 --> 00:08:54.155
Darkness rocks.

140
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.877
But I'll be honest. I don't think
anybody here really appreciates that.

141
00:08:57.919 --> 00:09:01.557
- Uh-uh.
- Sav and I, we toured the Prado over break, and--

142
00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.136
That's in Spain.

143
00:09:03.536 --> 00:09:06.582
And, um, we got in this discussion
one day at the cafe...

144
00:09:06.665 --> 00:09:11.022
just about-- about how many artists are really
only truly appreciated posthumously.

145
00:09:11.105 --> 00:09:13.909
And we got Van Gogh, Pissarro.

146
00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:15.554
- Basquait.
- Basquait. Thank you.

147
00:09:15.579 --> 00:09:17.157
A-And then your name came up.

148
00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:20.419
And Sav thought--
Actually, we both thought that...

149
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:23.089
it might be a good idea for you if, um--

150
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:25.218
You killed yourself.

151
00:09:27.329 --> 00:09:29.182
Think about it.

152
00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:39.239
- <i>(Bell rings)</i>
- <i>(Students chattering)</i>

153
00:09:39.322 --> 00:09:42.008
Well, check it out.
That's it for another day, earthquakes.

154
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:47.268
By the way, my condolences go out to a certain
individual who got dissed and dismissed...

155
00:09:47.268 --> 00:09:50.881
<i>by his long-time,
magically delicious girlfriend.</i>

156
00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:53.176
Relax, man.
No one knows it's you.

157
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.081
<i>(Deejay) Hey, hang in there, Zack.
It happens to the best of us.</i>

158
00:09:56.165 --> 00:09:57.833
<i>Keep that head up, all right, son?</i>

159
00:09:57.843 --> 00:10:02.703
As far as the other dude, if it doesn't kill you,
it only makes you stronger. All right?

160
00:10:02.858 --> 00:10:05.855
Yeah. You better do something, man,
'cause your legacy's in jeopardy here.

161
00:10:05.896 --> 00:10:09.802
I mean, one second
you're Zack Siler, Class President,

162
00:10:09.827 --> 00:10:12.906
standout athlete,
all-around bad-ass mamba-jahamba.

163
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:15.752
The next thing you know,
you're Zack Siler, bitch-boy.

164
00:10:20.842 --> 00:10:24.765
Hey, how are you guys?
Hey. Hey.

165
00:10:24.932 --> 00:10:27.686
- Brock.
- Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

166
00:10:27.853 --> 00:10:30.399
- Hi!
- Hey. Hey, baby.

167
00:10:40.414 --> 00:10:43.376
<i>(Chuckles)</i>
What's up? How's it going?

168
00:10:43.918 --> 00:10:46.457
Who the hell does
she think she is?

169
00:10:46.482 --> 00:10:50.554
There are 2,000 girls in this school, and I
can bump monkeys with every one of them.

170
00:10:50.637 --> 00:10:54.085
- Taylor Vaughan is totally replaceable.
- Spare me this wax shit...

171
00:10:54.169 --> 00:10:56.688
about replaceable, because we're
talking about Taylor Vaughan here.

172
00:10:56.772 --> 00:10:59.159
- Sorry, man. He's-- He's right.
- Of course I'm right.

173
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.862
I mean, the girl's
an institution in this place.

174
00:11:00.903 --> 00:11:03.516
Every girl wants to be her,
and every guy wants to nail her.

175
00:11:03.558 --> 00:11:07.621
- Basically, she's you... with tits.
- <i>(Laughs)</i>

176
00:11:08.463 --> 00:11:10.167
Nah, nah, you're wrong, you see.

177
00:11:10.534 --> 00:11:14.590
The Taylor Vaughan you just described
is an illusion, a myth.

178
00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.708
You strip away all that
attitude and makeup...

179
00:11:16.735 --> 00:11:19.498
and basically all you have is
a C minus G.P.A. with a Wonder Bra.

180
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.401
Oh, give it up.

181
00:11:21.643 --> 00:11:25.147
Take, uh--
Take her for example.

182
00:11:25.189 --> 00:11:26.892
Short, decent rack,

183
00:11:26.976 --> 00:11:30.280
kind of a Chelsea Clinton thing going on.

184
00:11:30.405 --> 00:11:33.034
But given the right look,

185
00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:34.562
the right boyfriend, bam!

186
00:11:34.846 --> 00:11:37.875
In six weeks, she's the one
being crowned prom queen.

187
00:11:37.917 --> 00:11:40.821
- You're serious?
- As a heart attack.

188
00:11:40.863 --> 00:11:44.728
You're clearly delusional. But how
about a chance to prove me wrong?

189
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.783
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Dean, Dean, Dean. The boy's bugging here.

190
00:11:48.967 --> 00:11:51.771
You're taking advantage of a friend
in a vulnerable situation.

191
00:11:51.855 --> 00:11:55.010
Gee, that's swell, Preston. A fifth of Chivas
and a uterus and you could be my mom.

192
00:11:55.051 --> 00:11:58.842
No, seriously. The guy thinks he
could do anything. Let him prove it.

193
00:12:00.325 --> 00:12:03.121
- What do you say, Zack?
- A bet?

194
00:12:03.163 --> 00:12:06.710
Yeah. Unless, of course,
you're too heartbroken.

195
00:12:07.937 --> 00:12:10.658
- Just name the terms.
- All right, it's simple.

196
00:12:10.742 --> 00:12:16.099
I'll pick the girl, and you got six weeks
to turn her into the prom queen.

197
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:19.039
Okay, okay, we get it, okay?

198
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.942
- <i>(Preston) Everybody has a big jimmy. Now can we just--</i>
- You got it.

199
00:12:23.568 --> 00:12:28.043
- All right. Let's go shopping.
- <i>(Laughing)</i>

200
00:12:28.784 --> 00:12:31.706
Oh, man, this is
going to be so much fun.

201
00:12:31.831 --> 00:12:33.822
- <i>(Preston) What about her?
- (Dean) Nah, I don't think so.</i>

202
00:12:33.835 --> 00:12:36.031
<i>(Girl) I mean it's still scabbing.
See, I saved it.</i>

203
00:12:36.081 --> 00:12:37.581
Hey, how about this one?

204
00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:39.551
A-Are you sure about Bubbles?

205
00:12:39.635 --> 00:12:41.655
Nah, we can do better than that.

206
00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:45.268
<i>(Zack) What about her?</i>

207
00:12:45.351 --> 00:12:48.856
Rectal archaeology. Very nice.

208
00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:53.590
Stupid, stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid.

209
00:12:53.715 --> 00:12:55.001
<i>(Gasps)</i>

210
00:12:57.345 --> 00:13:00.415
Gentlemen, we have a winner.

211
00:13:00.857 --> 00:13:02.628
<i>(Zack) What, Laney Boggs?</i>

212
00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:04.439
Nuh-uh! No. No, no, no, no.

213
00:13:04.523 --> 00:13:06.526
Hey, a bet's a bet, bro. Right, Preston?

214
00:13:06.667 --> 00:13:09.929
Hey, man, this is between you guys.

215
00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:13.226
- <i>(Laughing)
- (Exhales)</i>

216
00:13:15.455 --> 00:13:17.683
L-L-Look, fat I can handle.

217
00:13:17.708 --> 00:13:20.737
Weird boobs, bad personality,
maybe some sort of fungus.

218
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.453
Come on. Scary and inaccessible
is another story.

219
00:13:25.894 --> 00:13:28.558
Hey, man, if I were you,
I wouldn't be wasting my time.

220
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:31.337
'Cause by my calculations
you got six weeks until the prom.

221
00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:33.583
And if-- if Laney Boggs
is going to be queen,

222
00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:36.187
I'd say you pretty much got
your work cut out for you.

223
00:13:40.225 --> 00:13:43.104
- Hi, Laney. You got a second?
- <i>(Boy) Here comes Zack.</i>

224
00:13:43.688 --> 00:13:45.942
What's up, Spaz?

225
00:13:46.584 --> 00:13:47.795
He knows my name.

226
00:13:47.837 --> 00:13:50.900
That's not your name.
That's not his name.

227
00:13:50.941 --> 00:13:53.244
Oh. Sorry.

228
00:13:55.188 --> 00:13:56.317
So, Laney, listen.

229
00:13:56.384 --> 00:14:00.255
- I was wondering if maybe you'd want to...
- Let's go, Simon.

230
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.593
embarrass me horribly
in front of all these people?

231
00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:07.124
- Laney--
- Come on. Dad's waiting. Let's go.

232
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.438
<i>(Laughter)</i>

233
00:14:14.502 --> 00:14:17.356
Wait! Watch this.

234
00:14:17.498 --> 00:14:21.105
- <i>(Farts)</i>
- Oh! Damn it, Brock.

235
00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:23.395
Yeah! Good.

236
00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:27.221
Relax, man. Smells like roses.

237
00:14:27.321 --> 00:14:30.426
I will not relax.
You-- You are being disrespectful.

238
00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:33.422
You are disrespecting me
and you are disrespecting Harmony.

239
00:14:33.547 --> 00:14:36.151
It's not about disrespect.
It's just gas.

240
00:14:36.235 --> 00:14:41.050
- That's about enough of this.
- How's the queen of The Real World?

241
00:14:41.092 --> 00:14:43.046
How did you know about that?

242
00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:47.951
Please. They've only run that
spring break thing like a zillion times.

243
00:14:47.993 --> 00:14:50.602
So, uh, who's the lucky rebound skank?

244
00:14:50.775 --> 00:14:52.075
Rebound skank?

245
00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:57.591
- Well, there's got to be somebody, right?
- Well, I wouldn't say somebody, but...

246
00:14:57.674 --> 00:15:00.262
there is sort of a project.

247
00:15:00.387 --> 00:15:02.640
- "Project"?
- Yeah.

248
00:15:02.682 --> 00:15:07.105
To tell you the truth, she kind of, uh--
she kind of blew me off.

249
00:15:07.147 --> 00:15:08.633
I like her already.

250
00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:11.846
Well, the only thing I can figure
is it's got to be some kind of mistake.

251
00:15:11.887 --> 00:15:14.449
Zack, I realize it's a difficult concept

252
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.412
for a bitch magnet
such as yourself to grasp, but...

253
00:15:17.754 --> 00:15:21.661
did it ever occur to you
to make a little effort?

254
00:15:21.686 --> 00:15:23.257
What do you mean?

255
00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:25.257
Find out where she hangs out.

256
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:28.053
- Find out what she likes.
- <i>(Door closes)</i>

257
00:15:28.437 --> 00:15:30.558
Oh, crap.
Mom and Dad are home.

258
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:33.979
lf they ask, I'm at Ashley's.

259
00:15:34.062 --> 00:15:36.850
Her brother's home.
He's so cute.

260
00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:40.948
He just got kicked out
of military school.

261
00:15:43.994 --> 00:15:46.315
Zachary, how was the first day back?

262
00:15:46.457 --> 00:15:48.918
Ah. School is school.

263
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.372
Taylor and the girls
have a good time in Florida?

264
00:15:51.514 --> 00:15:55.035
- I guess so.
- There's still no word on the Dartmouth application?

265
00:15:55.077 --> 00:15:56.380
Obviously not.

266
00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.284
You haven't heard from
a single university yet.

267
00:15:58.284 --> 00:16:01.139
Isn't that a bit unusual
at this point in the year?

268
00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:02.639
Not really.

269
00:16:02.764 --> 00:16:05.284
You know, maybe I ought to give
Ken Wortham in the Alumni office a buzz.

270
00:16:05.368 --> 00:16:10.909
- I owe him a call anyway.
- Nah, nah. Let's give it a couple of days.

271
00:16:10.951 --> 00:16:13.914
Probably hear something by Friday.

272
00:16:15.158 --> 00:16:18.170
We'll give it until the end of the week.

273
00:16:57.229 --> 00:16:59.733
Does my tattoo look red to you?

274
00:16:59.833 --> 00:17:02.456
Come on, girl. Don't you care
about anything anymore?

275
00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:04.656
What are we spewing about?

276
00:17:04.698 --> 00:17:09.113
Well, two weeks ago, we were helping you
plan your prom queen acceptance speech.

277
00:17:09.255 --> 00:17:12.044
Now, all of a sudden, everything's, like,
"Brock this" and "Brock that"...

278
00:17:12.068 --> 00:17:13.730
and "my tattoo."

279
00:17:14.171 --> 00:17:17.318
Taylor, the last thing you want to do
five weeks before the election...

280
00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:19.046
is alienate people.

281
00:17:19.129 --> 00:17:21.483
- And what is <i>that</i> supposed to mean?
- I think...

282
00:17:21.524 --> 00:17:25.938
what she's trying to say is
you should be careful. Right?

283
00:17:26.063 --> 00:17:27.541
Careful of what? Okay.

284
00:17:27.566 --> 00:17:29.412
I can win this thing
in fluorescent lighting...

285
00:17:29.495 --> 00:17:33.058
on the first day of my period,
cloaked in T.J. Maxx. Okay?

286
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.695
My mother was prom queen in '71.

287
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.674
My cousin, prom queen in '82.

288
00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:40.169
And my sister would have been
prom queen in '94...

289
00:17:40.211 --> 00:17:42.714
if it wasn't for that scandal
on the Color Me Badd tour bus, okay?

290
00:17:42.714 --> 00:17:45.109
I am a goddamn legacy, all right?

291
00:17:45.234 --> 00:17:48.865
And besides, not to be a bitch,
but who's going to beat Taylor Vaughan?

292
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.061
God, I hope that's not
your acceptance speech.

293
00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:57.545
Okay, sir, that will be one tahina kebab
with a side of spiced hummus salad.

294
00:17:57.645 --> 00:18:00.156
Would you like to super-size
those falafel balls?

295
00:18:00.198 --> 00:18:03.954
Hmm. Let me see.

296
00:18:03.954 --> 00:18:09.170
- Laney.
- Exactly what does this super-size entail?

297
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:12.091
Stalking is illegal in all 50 states.

298
00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:15.071
- Come on. I just want to talk.
- I find myself torn.

299
00:18:15.171 --> 00:18:17.549
Perhaps I could see
a sample ball...

300
00:18:17.633 --> 00:18:20.580
to better equip myself
for such a decision.

301
00:18:20.705 --> 00:18:25.277
- Don't you have a break coming up?
- One moment, sir.

302
00:18:25.361 --> 00:18:27.781
Uh, uh, miss?

303
00:18:27.864 --> 00:18:29.993
One moment, sir.

304
00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:32.196
I'm not smart.

305
00:18:32.222 --> 00:18:32.810
What?

306
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.310
What? You figure I could--
I could tutor you or something?

307
00:18:35.351 --> 00:18:38.360
- You think, "Oh, well, there's Laney Boggs. She's a dork.
- Look, Laney. Laney.

308
00:18:38.364 --> 00:18:40.626
She must at least be smart."
Well, guess what, I'm not.

309
00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:45.182
Laney! I have the fourth
highest G.P.A. in our class.

310
00:18:47.176 --> 00:18:48.805
Mm-hmm.

311
00:18:49.588 --> 00:18:53.903
Oh. What is this, some kind of new dork
outreach program? I'm just not, uh--

312
00:18:53.945 --> 00:18:56.308
- No, it-- Are you always like this?
- No.

313
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.450
Yes.

314
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.697
Come on. Five minutes.

315
00:19:00.781 --> 00:19:03.710
- <i>(Customer) Miss?</i>
- Five seconds.

316
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.308
Okay. Um, I really
wanted to talk to you about...

317
00:19:10.161 --> 00:19:11.972
- Art.
- Art?

318
00:19:12.097 --> 00:19:15.127
- You don't take art.
- How do you know?

319
00:19:15.152 --> 00:19:17.856
How come I haven't seen you
in any of my classes?

320
00:19:17.898 --> 00:19:20.302
Well, 'cause I'm-- I'm busy
with soccer and stuff.

321
00:19:20.344 --> 00:19:23.298
So they let me take
one of those, uh-- the, uh--

322
00:19:23.398 --> 00:19:26.211
- Independent studies?
- Yes.

323
00:19:28.956 --> 00:19:33.021
But listen, I saw some of your stuff
in class. It's really good.

324
00:19:33.063 --> 00:19:36.802
So... any kind of help you could give me,
I'd appreciate it.

325
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:43.144
- Sure. I-- Maybe sometime.
- How about tonight?

326
00:19:44.872 --> 00:19:47.609
The show at the Jester.
You can have my ticket.

327
00:19:47.992 --> 00:19:49.446
That's great!

328
00:19:50.071 --> 00:19:52.366
One moment, please.

329
00:19:53.952 --> 00:19:56.197
- Ow!
- Look. I kicked your ass in third grade.

330
00:19:56.222 --> 00:19:59.503
- I'll do it again.
- Okay. One, I was sick that day.

331
00:19:59.528 --> 00:20:01.406
And two, are you crazy?

332
00:20:01.431 --> 00:20:03.409
I mean, the best-looking guy
in school's stalking you,

333
00:20:03.434 --> 00:20:05.314
and you're not the least bit curious?

334
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:15.752
Okay, here's the deal. The show's at 7:30.
Parking can be a problem.

335
00:20:15.893 --> 00:20:19.115
Meet me there at 7:00.
Don't be late.

336
00:20:20.659 --> 00:20:22.620
7:00 it is.

337
00:20:22.662 --> 00:20:24.267
Hey, do you want to maybe go
have some dinner before--

338
00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:25.467
No.

339
00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:28.629
I'll see you at 7:00.

340
00:20:28.671 --> 00:20:30.601
I'm sorry, sir.
Have you made your decision?

341
00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:34.288
Yes, I have.
Super-size my balls.

342
00:21:07.872 --> 00:21:13.196
<i>(Male actor's voice) Snug in the
putrid womb of a mother he never knew.</i>

343
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.369
The fetus...
rising, floating.

344
00:21:17.452 --> 00:21:21.175
That's Mitch.
Brilliant, isn't he?

345
00:21:21.258 --> 00:21:25.673
- <i>(Explosion)</i>
- Bursting forth! Rushing forward!

346
00:21:25.714 --> 00:21:28.795
Surging! Emerging!

347
00:21:34.478 --> 00:21:36.940
<i>(Gagging)</i>

348
00:21:40.987 --> 00:21:45.202
My soul is an island.
My car is a Ford.

349
00:21:46.579 --> 00:21:48.582
I want to be like Mike.

350
00:21:50.084 --> 00:21:54.007
<i>(Mitch) Falling! Plunging!
Nay, expunging!</i>

351
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.010
<i>(All laughing)</i>

352
00:21:56.093 --> 00:21:58.514
Whoo-hoo!
Aah-ah-ah!

353
00:22:30.995 --> 00:22:33.691
Be silent, be still.

354
00:22:33.733 --> 00:22:37.572
<i>(Together)
Be silent, be still.</i>

355
00:22:37.614 --> 00:22:41.077
<i>Be silent, be still.</i>

00:22:41.161 --> 00:22:44.708
<i>Be silent, be still.</i>

357
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.630
<i>Be silent, be still.</i>

358
00:22:48.714 --> 00:22:52.261
<i>Be silent, be still.</i>

359
00:22:52.386 --> 00:22:55.224
<i>(Applause)</i>

360
00:23:04.087 --> 00:23:06.407
Oh!

361
00:23:07.659 --> 00:23:09.620
Thank you very much.

362
00:23:09.662 --> 00:23:11.748
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

363
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.161
<i>Um, before you leave,
our performer, Laney,</i>

364
00:23:14.186 --> 00:23:18.007
has just informed me that there is
an exciting new voice among us.

365
00:23:18.009 --> 00:23:20.338
Is there a Zack Siler
in the house?

366
00:23:23.222 --> 00:23:25.286
- <i>(Audience murmuring)</i>
- Come on. Don't be shy.

367
00:23:26.108 --> 00:23:27.590
We're all friends here.

368
00:23:29.893 --> 00:23:33.281
Look, you don't have to go
if you're not interested.

369
00:23:33.448 --> 00:23:36.744
Art is love, people.
Art is love.

370
00:23:40.976 --> 00:23:43.212
Welcome, friend.

371
00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:48.971
<i>(Exhales)</i>

372
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:03.660
How's it going?

373
00:24:06.914 --> 00:24:08.876
<i>(Clears throat)</i>

374
00:24:19.808 --> 00:24:21.979
<i>(Chuckles)</i>
It's a hacky sack.

375
00:24:22.104 --> 00:24:25.651

- <i>(Clears throat)</i>

<i>(Drum continues)</i>

377
00:24:30.317 --> 00:24:34.998
Whew! Hacky sack.

378
00:24:36.293 --> 00:24:39.255
Hacky sack.

379
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.512
<i>Bounce.</i>

380
00:24:45.496 --> 00:24:46.725
<i>Bounce.</i>

381
00:24:47.308 --> 00:24:49.537
<i>You got to keep bouncing.</i>

382
00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:54.611
Can't let it drop.

383
00:24:56.447 --> 00:24:58.485
Never let it drop.

384
00:25:02.021 --> 00:25:04.109
<i>Come on, Zack.</i>

385
00:25:04.709 --> 00:25:06.072
<i>Everyone's watching.</i>

386
00:25:08.791 --> 00:25:10.669
Expecting.

387
00:25:12.588 --> 00:25:16.310
Never... let it...

388
00:25:20.542 --> 00:25:22.112
drop.

389
00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:28.204
Everyone's counting on you, Zack!

390
00:25:34.212 --> 00:25:35.573
Don't let it drop!

391
00:25:37.425 --> 00:25:40.596
Don't... ever...

392
00:25:40.638 --> 00:25:42.599
let it...

393
00:25:45.646 --> 00:25:47.732
drop!

394
00:25:47.774 --> 00:25:51.780
<i>(Breathing heavily)</i>

395
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.007
Sooner or later...

396
00:26:07.019 --> 00:26:09.682
it has to drop.

397
00:26:25.914 --> 00:26:28.853
Oh, man, I can't believe
I just did that!

398
00:26:28.978 --> 00:26:31.691
Well, I'd be lying if I didn't say
I was a little surprised myself.

399
00:26:31.775 --> 00:26:36.097
- So, tell me the truth. How bad did I suck?
- You were good.

400
00:26:36.181 --> 00:26:39.118
Come on! That thing you did
with the paint and all the garbage,

401
00:26:39.202 --> 00:26:40.721
that was really good.

402
00:26:40.805 --> 00:26:43.508
All I did was kick around a beanbag.

403
00:26:43.792 --> 00:26:45.278
All right, a little.

404
00:26:45.903 --> 00:26:49.491
A lot. You sucked a lot.
Boy, you really blew.

405
00:26:49.533 --> 00:26:51.512
- You feel better now?
- I don't care.

406
00:26:51.595 --> 00:26:54.015
Oh, man, I-I've given,
speeches and stuff,

407
00:26:54.099 --> 00:26:57.312
but, being up there and not knowing
what to do, it--

408
00:26:57.496 --> 00:27:00.017
- Bit of a rush, isn't it?
- Yeah.

409
00:27:00.758 --> 00:27:02.071
Whew!

410
00:27:08.937 --> 00:27:10.135
What?

411
00:27:10.635 --> 00:27:12.735
Do you always wear those glasses?

412
00:27:12.818 --> 00:27:14.141
Yeah. Why?

413
00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:16.741
No reason.

414
00:27:19.044 --> 00:27:21.122
You ever think about contacts?

415
00:27:22.207 --> 00:27:25.963
Mm, I have them.
I just never wear 'em.

416
00:27:26.088 --> 00:27:28.517
I don't know.
The idea of touching my eye is--

417
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.224
Because your eyes
are really... beautiful.

418
00:27:33.707 --> 00:27:37.522
- Oh, please.
- What?

419
00:27:37.647 --> 00:27:40.735
"Your eyes are really beautiful"?

420
00:27:41.118 --> 00:27:44.031
You really broke out the big guns
with that one, didn't you?

421
00:27:44.115 --> 00:27:47.395
- Laney, I was just--
- No. I had an instinct. I went against it.

422
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.748
This is my fault.

423
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.586
Wha-- Laney, I'm not following.

424
00:27:53.629 --> 00:27:55.216
You want to know about art?

425
00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:59.322
When the class president starts touching
my face on darkened street corners

426
00:27:59.322 --> 00:28:02.326
and talking about my eyes,
there's a word for it.

427
00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:05.873
There's an entire movement in the '20s.
It's called "surreal".

428
00:28:05.998 --> 00:28:10.112
- Laney, wait. Can't we just--
- You go. I'm going to catch a ride with Mitch.

429
00:28:10.196 --> 00:28:11.757
The underwear guy?

430
00:28:14.202 --> 00:28:18.667
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
It's on. It's on.

431
00:28:18.708 --> 00:28:21.146
Hey, this is great. Listen.

432
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.092
<i>(On TV)
I got a question for you. Oh!</i>

433
00:28:24.633 --> 00:28:26.136
<i>All right, this guy--</i>

434
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.784
<i>Would you kiss him for like, say, 500 bucks on,
like, a public access channel?</i>

435
00:28:29.826 --> 00:28:32.230
Oh, wait, wait, wait. This is
where I get sensitive.

436
00:28:32.896 --> 00:28:36.819
<i>My whole problem in the house
is that I was an only child.</i>

437
00:28:36.944 --> 00:28:38.823
<i>I didn't have a lot of friends,
never had roommates before.</i>

438
00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:42.028
<i>So I don't know how to, like,
deal with everyone.</i>

439
00:28:42.153 --> 00:28:45.191
<i>A lot of people here in this house
think I'm cold and insensitive.</i>

440
00:28:45.233 --> 00:28:48.304
<i>But underneath that, I've got,
like, a big-- This is big.</i>

441
00:28:48.346 --> 00:28:51.257
- Hey, you ho.
- <i>(Girl, off camera): (Beep)-off.</i>

442
00:28:51.999 --> 00:28:53.719
<i>See what I mean?</i>

443
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:56.091
Ah! Uh, baby, can you not
do that right now?

444
00:28:56.174 --> 00:28:58.653
I'm, like, I'm reading for
the new Spelling drama at 2:00,

445
00:28:58.687 --> 00:29:01.043
and I really-- you know,
I don't want to smell like your spit.

446
00:29:01.282 --> 00:29:06.631
It's like all over.
So... just stop. Thank you. Watch.

447
00:29:07.156 --> 00:29:09.552
- Oh, God.
- <i>(Brock, on TV) ...from my mom's sister...</i>

448
00:29:09.594 --> 00:29:11.155

00:29:11.197 --> 00:29:14.059
- <i>(Brock, on TV) Yes. Yes, yes, my aunt.</i>
- This is where I-- Watch this.

450
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.256
This is where I get
Brando on them. Watch.

451
00:29:18.298 --> 00:29:19.015
Very Brando.

452
00:29:19.316 --> 00:29:24.015
<i>Do me a favor. Why don't you all
just stay out of my closet!</i>

453
00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.727
<i>God!</i>

00:29:30.083 --> 00:29:31.644
- Mornin'.
- Morning.

456
00:29:31.686 --> 00:29:33.040
Zack Siler.

457
00:29:33.047 --> 00:29:34.047
Pleasure.

458
00:29:34.189 --> 00:29:36.509
- Nice truck.
- Thanks.

459
00:29:36.693 --> 00:29:40.002
Yuck! I get a lot of stuff
out of people's pool drains.

460
00:29:40.014 --> 00:29:43.653
You never know what you're going to find.
I got this over at the university.

461
00:29:43.736 --> 00:29:45.753
At one of the fraternities, I found this.
Belonged to a football player,

462
00:29:45.756 --> 00:29:49.970
- who's actually a Heisman trophy runner-up.
- No kidding.

463
00:29:50.095 --> 00:29:53.225
- Zack, my man.
- Simon, hey.

464
00:29:53.392 --> 00:29:56.105
Hey, you want to play
some Sega? Sega!

465
00:29:57.189 --> 00:29:59.852
- Maybe later.
- Loves Sega.

466
00:29:59.952 --> 00:30:01.382
Would you excuse us a minute?

467
00:30:01.582 --> 00:30:02.982
What did <i>I</i> do?

468
00:30:03.407 --> 00:30:04.621
Not you, him.

469
00:30:04.721 --> 00:30:06.121
What did <i>I</i> do?

470
00:30:07.204 --> 00:30:09.750
- Hey, give me a hand here, will you?
- <i>(Simon) Yeah, sure.</i>

471
00:30:09.792 --> 00:30:13.014
Look, you can't just keep
showing up like this.

472
00:30:13.055 --> 00:30:16.468
And you can't keep avoiding me.
Like the other night. What was that?

473
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.240
- I was busy.
- Yeah. Busy wigging.

474
00:30:19.323 --> 00:30:22.895
- Excuse me. I did not wig.
- There was major wiggage.

475
00:30:23.978 --> 00:30:28.027
- So, you want to go to the beach?
- No.

476
00:30:28.153 --> 00:30:31.709
- You hate the beach?
- Yes. No.

477
00:30:31.872 --> 00:30:33.996
- I don't have time for this.
- Fine.

478
00:30:34.046 --> 00:30:36.016
- I'm leaving.
- Fine.

479
00:30:38.209 --> 00:30:42.007
- Simon, how about that Sega?
- Yeah.

480
00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:44.428
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting ready to play some Sega.

481
00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:46.390
- No, you're not.
- Look, I believe I was invited.

482
00:30:46.473 --> 00:30:47.680
I am uninviting you.

483
00:30:47.685 --> 00:30:49.385
You're not the boss of him.

484
00:30:50.829 --> 00:30:54.317
The man does have a point.

485
00:30:54.442 --> 00:30:59.950
<i>(Exhales)</i> Yep, looks like
a long afternoon of Sega.

486
00:30:59.992 --> 00:31:04.457
And, hey, maybe your dad
can show me some more pool stuff.

487
00:31:04.999 --> 00:31:07.128
I'll get my suit.

488
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:14.292
<i>(Zack) Well, once the clouds lifted,</i>

489
00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:16.926
<i>it turned out to be
a pretty okay day.</i>

490
00:31:19.104 --> 00:31:20.890
Check out that water.

491
00:31:21.232 --> 00:31:25.981
Do you know how many gallons of chemicals
are dumped into the oceans each year?

492
00:31:26.007 --> 00:31:28.994
Don't you ever just kick back?

493
00:31:29.035 --> 00:31:31.807
I mean, I know the world
has its problems.

494
00:31:32.049 --> 00:31:34.296
But would it hurt you
to smile once in a while?

495
00:31:35.296 --> 00:31:36.496
I smile.

496
00:31:36.622 --> 00:31:39.998
It's just you mentioned the ocean,
and I saw this thing on CNN--

497
00:31:40.011 --> 00:31:44.016
- No, forget CNN.
- <i>(Dean) Hey, yo, Siler, what's up?</i>

498
00:31:44.016 --> 00:31:45.978
<i>(Zack) Great. Okay.</i>

499
00:31:46.078 --> 00:31:50.752
Listen. lf we're going to be friends, we have
to deal with them sooner or later, right?

500
00:31:54.031 --> 00:31:55.193
Come on.

501
00:31:58.295 --> 00:31:59.809
Yeah, so I called your house,

502
00:31:59.849 --> 00:32:00.744
and they said
you were at the beach,

503
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:04.257
so I figured...
you must be at your spot.

504
00:32:05.341 --> 00:32:08.011
- You know, many a woman has lost it here.
- Shut up, Dean.

505
00:32:08.136 --> 00:32:11.541
Uh, you, uh, have to forgive our man here.
His shorts are kind of tight.

506
00:32:11.624 --> 00:32:14.701
Cuts off the circulation to his brain.
I'm Preston.

507
00:32:14.705 --> 00:32:16.691
I know who you are.

508
00:32:17.233 --> 00:32:20.323
Hey, Laney. It <i>is</i> Laney, right?

509
00:32:20.823 --> 00:32:21.623
Yeah.

510
00:32:21.648 --> 00:32:24.118
Well, come on, Zack, help us get
the rest of the stuff from the car.

511
00:32:24.201 --> 00:32:25.621
Yeah.

512
00:32:32.172 --> 00:32:35.510
Sooo... think the mourning
period's over yet?

513
00:32:35.552 --> 00:32:38.139
Please. It's way over.

514
00:32:38.264 --> 00:32:40.267
"Mourning period"?

515
00:32:40.267 --> 00:32:42.918
Yeah, without Taylor, uh,
Zack's available now.

516
00:32:43.031 --> 00:32:47.153
Yeah, but what's the deal? I mean,
don't tell me you guys are on a date.

517
00:32:47.236 --> 00:32:50.242
- No, we're just--
- Friends?

518
00:32:55.916 --> 00:32:58.630
Hey, now, check out
the bobos on super freak.

519
00:32:59.713 --> 00:33:03.928
You know, Zack, from up here,
she almost looks normal.

520
00:33:08.476 --> 00:33:10.948
So, is this what you ladies
gonna do all day?

521
00:33:11.132 --> 00:33:15.237
No. In 15 minutes, I have
every intention of turning over.

522
00:33:15.337 --> 00:33:17.993
All right. Just thought
you all might want to play.

523
00:33:18.288 --> 00:33:19.693
No, thanks.

524
00:33:21.035 --> 00:33:25.669
- So, what about you, Laney?
- No, um, I don't think so.

525
00:33:25.752 --> 00:33:30.301
- Is your name Laney?
- No. Thank God. No offense.

526
00:33:30.726 --> 00:33:32.004
None taken.

527
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:35.217
It's just I've seen you in gym class.
You run like a girl.

528
00:33:35.258 --> 00:33:37.005
I am a girl.

529
00:33:37.105 --> 00:33:39.105
Oh, you know what I mean.

530
00:33:39.189 --> 00:33:41.034
Obviously, I don't.

531
00:33:43.338 --> 00:33:46.742
So, uh, you in or out?

532
00:33:50.139 --> 00:33:51.116
In.

533
00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:53.252
Ah, lovely. Ha ha ha!

534
00:33:54.454 --> 00:33:57.550
- Me too.
- <i>(Girl) Really?</i>

535
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.991
- Got it!
- Mine! Mine!

536
00:34:15.093 --> 00:34:17.206
Just like that.

537
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.993
So, Zack, my house tonight?

538
00:34:43.118 --> 00:34:45.205
Uh... yeah.

539
00:34:45.346 --> 00:34:47.901
So what about you, Laney?
See you at Preston's tonight?

540
00:34:47.926 --> 00:34:50.705
- I don't think so.
- Aw, come on. You got to be.

541
00:34:50.747 --> 00:34:52.876
Yeah, you should.
Preston's parties are the best.

542
00:34:52.959 --> 00:34:55.279
- Booze, tunes, hotties.
- Dean--

543
00:34:55.362 --> 00:34:58.208
No, seriously. His house is enormous.
His dad owns Harrison Ford.

544
00:34:58.233 --> 00:35:00.520
- The actor?
- No, the car dealership.

545
00:35:00.762 --> 00:35:03.482
So, what do you say?

546
00:35:03.524 --> 00:35:06.236
Uh, sure.

547
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.448
Good things.

548
00:35:09.492 --> 00:35:12.488
- Well, this should be interesting.
- Will you shut up?

549
00:35:12.513 --> 00:35:18.463
What? Even if they are broken up, if Zack shows
up with her, Taylor's going to shit Frisbees.

550
00:35:18.504 --> 00:35:21.225
<i>(Dean) Zack, Laney,
always a pleasure.</i>

551
00:35:21.267 --> 00:35:24.063
- Okay, man, see you.
- Later.

552
00:35:24.063 --> 00:35:25.776
- <i>See you guys later.
- See you.</i>

553
00:35:25.783 --> 00:35:28.045
<i>(Girl) Bye. See you later. Bye.</i>

554
00:35:32.025 --> 00:35:35.822
Well, we survived, right?

555
00:35:38.409 --> 00:35:42.207
So, about Preston's thing tonight...

556
00:35:42.248 --> 00:35:45.045
- I can't.
- But you just said that--

557
00:35:45.128 --> 00:35:48.174
I-- I know. I just...

558
00:35:48.257 --> 00:35:50.928
forgot I have to clean the house.

559
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:55.936
It's really dirty.
Almost... unliveable.

560
00:35:57.521 --> 00:35:59.691
Sorry to hear that.

561
00:36:11.643 --> 00:36:15.432
<i>(Alex Trebek) Thomas Welch

563

- What is non-alcoholic wine?
- <i>(Contestant) What is grape juice?</i>

564
00:36:20.072 --> 00:36:21.550
- No.
- <i>(Trebek) That's right.</i>

565
00:36:21.675 --> 00:36:24.529
- <i>(Jesse) You said no?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

566
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:27.333
- <i>Why?</i>
- I said I had stuff to do.

567
00:36:27.375 --> 00:36:29.370
Laney, sitting around
with your father

568
00:36:29.395 --> 00:36:33.993
while he watches <i>Jeopardy!</i> in his
underwear hardly qualifies as "stuff to do".

569
00:36:34.034 --> 00:36:37.407
- Who is Lou Rawls?
- You know me too well.

570
00:36:37.448 --> 00:36:40.211
I think you're afraid to let
anything good happen to you.

571
00:36:40.253 --> 00:36:43.499
I mean, did it ever occur to you
that maybe Zack <i>really</i> likes you?

572
00:36:43.524 --> 00:36:45.961
- Trust me. He doesn't.
- <i>(Knocking at door)</i>

573

- I got to go.

- Who is Lamo?

- <i>(Contestant) Who is Zeppo?
- (Trebek) That's correct. Pick again.</i>

576
00:36:56.889 --> 00:36:57.858
Hello.

Zack. <i>Mi compadre con queso.</i>

- I, uh-- I believe you said you were cleaning.
- I am.

I was. I... will be.

How about I save you some time?

- Isn't... that... the soccer... team?
- It's J.V.

584
00:37:25.278 --> 00:37:27.448
- I need the vacuum cleaner.
- <i>It's over there in the corner.</i>

585
00:37:28.525 --> 00:37:32.239
- Go get dressed.
- I can't. I mean-- look at you.

Oh, God.

I'm a mess.

That's where I come in.

You can call me Mack.

591

You know, if you guys need us,
we'll be upstairs.

592
00:37:57.785 --> 00:37:59.913
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

597
00:38:13.284 --> 00:38:16.071
- What?
- As in your eyebrows?

598
00:38:16.138 --> 00:38:17.216
Never. Why?

599
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:21.087

So, Zack, can I get you a drink?

603
00:38:28.623 --> 00:38:31.335
Yeah, sure.
What do you got?

604
00:38:32.229 --> 00:38:33.974

822

What was up out there today, Zack?

823
00:53:22.942 --> 00:53:24.342
Didn't have it, man.

824
00:53:25.284 --> 00:53:29.059
Maybe. Or could it possibly
be a symptom of withdrawal?

825
00:53:29.459 --> 00:53:30.559
Excuse me?

826
00:53:31.401 --> 00:53:35.024
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but it has been
a little while since you've gotten any, right?

827
00:53:35.166 --> 00:53:38.296
And you know something like that can
really screw up a guy's concentration.

828
00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.002

you know, now that Taylor's free--

Whatever, Dean.

830
00:53:43.929 --> 00:53:46.375

831

You wanna know the weird part about it?

862
00:55:55.776 --> 00:55:58.323
I don't remember crying at all.

863
00:55:59.665 --> 00:56:01.703
I remember the funeral.

864
00:56:02.286 --> 00:56:05.174
And I remember afterwards
everyone went to my grandma's house,

865
00:56:05.174 --> 00:56:10.015
and I sat on this big green chair
with Simon in my lap.

866
00:56:11.157 --> 00:56:14.012
And I remember knowing...

867
00:56:14.095 --> 00:56:16.809
that things were never
going to be the same.

868
00:56:21.858 --> 00:56:23.919
Laney, you can't keep doing this.

869
00:56:26.498 --> 00:56:28.283
Doing what?

870
00:56:29.126 --> 00:56:31.046
Shutting everybody out.

871
00:56:31.788 --> 00:56:34.084
Sitting here with 19 locks on your door.

872
00:56:34.184 --> 00:56:36.130
So I shut people out.

873
00:56:37.755 --> 00:56:40.744
At least I make decisions,
which is more than I can say for you.

874
00:56:41.386 --> 00:56:43.639
- Look, I make decisions.
- Oh, yeah?

875
00:56:43.764 --> 00:56:45.501
Where are you going to college, Zack?

876
00:56:45.627 --> 00:56:49.691
I was by the counsellor's office yesterday.
I believe next to your name it said "Undecided".

877
00:56:49.874 --> 00:56:51.519
Look, there's stuff you don't understand.

878
00:56:51.702 --> 00:56:53.023
You don't live with my dad.

879
00:56:53.323 --> 00:56:54.823
Explain it to me.

880
00:56:58.001 --> 00:57:00.114
My dad went to Dartmouth.

881
00:57:00.498 --> 00:57:04.138
It was the best four years
of his life, so he says.

882
00:57:04.579 --> 00:57:07.001
So ever since I was born--

883
00:57:13.392 --> 00:57:16.223
There's a picture of me
in his office when I'm five.

884
00:57:16.664 --> 00:57:19.302
We're at the zoo or- or someplace.

885
00:57:19.485 --> 00:57:22.824
I'm sitting on his shoulders
wearing a Dartmouth sweatshirt.

886
00:57:24.176 --> 00:57:26.697
- So?
- So it's emblematic.

887
00:57:27.199 --> 00:57:29.684
I get it from him every day.

888
00:57:29.709 --> 00:57:32.029
"Pick a college, Zack.
Pick a future."

889
00:57:32.113 --> 00:57:36.236
But what he's really saying is,
"Pick <i>my</i> college. Choose <i>my</i> future."

890
00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.098
Are you listening to yourself?

891
00:57:39.198 --> 00:57:43.505
Do you realize how lucky you are?
You can go to Dartmouth. You can go to N.Y.U.

892
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:45.692
You can go to Borneo
and study squid fishing.

893
00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:49.464
The point is, you're 18, and that's
old enough to start making your own choices.

894
00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:53.620
O-Okay, okay.
Chill, Tony Robbins.

895
00:57:57.291 --> 00:57:59.003
What about you?

896
00:57:59.545 --> 00:58:02.091
Shouldn't you be looking in the mirror
when you say some of this stuff?

897
00:58:03.133 --> 00:58:05.322
Trust me. I'm working on it.

898
00:58:08.099 --> 00:58:10.562
So, are you always this smart?

899
00:58:10.862 --> 00:58:13.607
- Well, I have my moments.
- <i>(Chuckling)</i>

900

come here, Zack?

901

I forget.

902
00:58:36.124 --> 00:58:39.055

- Uh, I-- I got to run.

905
00:58:51.539 --> 00:58:53.001
I kind of wanted to talk
to you about it.

906
00:58:53.285 --> 00:58:55.379
Yeah, but I-- I have this sprinkler
thing to do for my dad.

907
00:58:55.604 --> 00:58:56.643
Now?

908
00:58:56.943 --> 00:58:58.543
Can I call you later?

909
00:58:59.785 --> 00:59:02.090
- Sure.
- All right, great.

<i>Weh, weh, weh. Huh?
What's her problem?</i>

913
00:59:11.689 --> 00:59:16.478
She doesn't like her million dollar makeover
or her overnight popularity? What is it?

914
00:59:16.578 --> 00:59:18.973
No, that's not the point, man.
I cared about her.

915
00:59:19.014 --> 00:59:23.213
I've got to hand it to you, Taylor.
Zack did <i>exactly</i> what you said he would.

916
00:59:23.396 --> 00:59:26.345
Of course he did.
I created him.

917

00:59:28.529 --> 00:59:30.248

- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Relax, man. All right?

920
00:59:35.264 --> 00:59:37.835
Besides, he did have
his entertaining moments.

Okay. For your information,
I was about to eat a Snack Time chip.

Snack Time owns Captain Peg-Leg Tuna

dolphin friendly.

- A guy tried that last year.

No way, man.
Those are his pubes.

1002
01:04:17.138 --> 01:04:19.317

thought about that

my friend Simon, huh?

Yeah. I'll take it from here.

Listen, uh, I stopped by.

01:05:28.537 --> 01:05:31.691
Well, look, I was-- I was
hoping maybe we could talk.

1017
01:05:34.003 --> 01:05:36.440
I know I-I don't come off
as the nicest guy in the world,

1018
01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:39.020
but I was hoping maybe you could
just forget about that for a second.

1019
01:05:39.261 --> 01:05:41.748
Because, uh, I was thinking--

1020
01:05:41.831 --> 01:05:43.735
well, actually I was hoping--

1021
01:05:44.418 --> 01:05:45.938
that...

1022
01:05:46.021 --> 01:05:47.541
maybe we can go out sometime.

1024
01:05:50.027 --> 01:05:52.081
And not just "out" out.

1025
01:05:52.406 --> 01:05:55.285
A specific out.
Like the prom, maybe?

1026
01:05:55.311 --> 01:05:56.898
<i>(Sarcastically)</i>
Yeah, right.

1027
01:05:58.123 --> 01:05:59.335
So that's a no?

1028
01:05:59.545 --> 01:06:01.235
That's a hell no.

1029
01:06:03.306 --> 01:06:07.053
Well, that's fair. I mean,
why should you say yes, right?

1030
01:06:08.063 --> 01:06:11.053
I just hope this isn't
about Zack, because--

1031
01:06:12.979 --> 01:06:14.156
Why?

1032
01:06:16.676 --> 01:06:20.431
Well... he doesn't care
about you like that.

1033
01:06:22.017 --> 01:06:25.146
<i>He told everybody he still
has this thing for Taylor.</i>

1034
01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.903
But I don't know.
I mean, maybe I got it all wrong.

1035
01:06:29.945 --> 01:06:31.906
Has the guy asked you to the prom?

<i>(Chops)</i>

1037
01:06:35.161 --> 01:06:38.158
Well, just-- just head's up, okay?

1038
01:06:38.183 --> 01:06:40.970
I mean, there's no sense
in getting hurt for no reason.

1039
01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:49.099
Oh, yeah, and, Laney?
Think about the prom some more.

1040

<i>'Cause, uh, we'd have
an okay time, I think.</i>

<i>(Continues chopping)</i>

1043
01:07:12.417 --> 01:07:14.872
- Dad.
- You want to explain this to me?

1044
01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:17.534
- Aw, could we talk about this--
- Have you got any idea...

1045
01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:19.662
how much you are jeopardizing
your future?

1046
01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:23.626
- Half of these acceptance deadlines have lapsed!
- It's not that easy, Dad.

1047
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:26.505
I'm not like you. I just can't
pick a letter out of a stack.

1048
01:07:26.631 --> 01:07:30.536
Of course you can. That's what being
an adult is all about. Making choices.

1049
01:07:30.619 --> 01:07:32.330
- Really.
- Yeah.

1050
01:07:32.414 --> 01:07:34.033
What about your choices, Dad?

1051
01:07:34.117 --> 01:07:36.145
- This is not about me.
- Aw, come on.

1052
01:07:36.228 --> 01:07:38.256
Look, you're never home.
You're pissed off half the time!

1053
01:07:38.382 --> 01:07:39.667
That's enough!

1054
01:07:42.488 --> 01:07:46.485
Look, I'm sorry. But you can't
fix your mistakes through me.

1055
01:07:48.947 --> 01:07:51.302
Is that what you think I'm doing?

1056
01:07:52.002 --> 01:07:55.040
Well, I'm sorry, but that
was never my intention.

1057
01:07:57.176 --> 01:08:00.372
And blaming me isn't going
to change the fact...

1058
01:08:00.414 --> 01:08:02.626
that the future is going to happen,

1059
01:08:02.667 --> 01:08:05.421
whether you are ready for it or not.

1060
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:21.505

Welcome to the homestretch, earthquakes.

Oh, out of my way, fool.

I think I touched her boob!

1076

Top of the stairs, please.

1077
01:09:09.869 --> 01:09:12.072
- Zack?
- What do you want, Taylor?

1078
01:09:12.097 --> 01:09:15.000
Well, I was trying on this little
Richard Tyler dress the other day,

1079
01:09:15.001 --> 01:09:17.964
and I remembered that we
haven't finalized our plans.

1080
01:09:18.006 --> 01:09:20.410
- What plans?
- For the prom, silly.

1081
01:09:20.535 --> 01:09:24.165
I mean, we said we'd always go together, right?
Even if we were just friends?

1082
01:09:24.265 --> 01:09:26.244
What happened to Lord of the Dance?

1083
01:09:26.369 --> 01:09:30.074
That is so over. I mean, God,
don't even get me started.

1084
01:09:31.927 --> 01:09:34.680
Actually, Taylor,
I had other plans in mind.

1085
01:09:34.722 --> 01:09:36.179
Oh?

1086
01:09:36.679 --> 01:09:39.179
You're not talking
about Laney Boggs, are you?

1087
01:09:40.104 --> 01:09:41.399
What if I am?

1088
01:09:41.641 --> 01:09:46.098
Well, if I'm not mistaken, Zack,
she's already taken.

1089
01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:50.714
- <i>(Dean) So what do you think?
- (Laney) Yeah, what do you think?</i>

1090
01:09:50.839 --> 01:09:55.253
- I think it would be cool.
- Well, this goes up here.

1091
01:09:55.378 --> 01:09:58.424
- <i>(Laney) It definitely lights--</i>
- Dean? What the hell are you trying to pull?

1092
01:09:58.966 --> 01:10:00.509
Well, it's nice to see you, too, brother.

1093
01:10:00.689 --> 01:10:02.039
Did he ask you to the prom?

1094
01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:04.433
- Yes, I did.
- I--

1095
01:10:04.558 --> 01:10:05.546
It's bullshit!

1096
01:10:05.586 --> 01:10:07.939
Wait, wait.
Someone asking me is bullshit?

1097
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.046
I thought we were going together.

1098
01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:15.033
All right, Zack, enough's enough.
This isn't cool anymore. I like this girl

1099
01:10:15.217 --> 01:10:17.512
<i>and you got to stop
this whole bet thing.</i>

1100
01:10:22.377 --> 01:10:25.565
- Bet?
- Yeah. It was so stupid, Laney.

1101
01:10:25.691 --> 01:10:28.697
Look, Zack said he can make any girl
prom queen, and you were the one picked.

1102
01:10:28.728 --> 01:10:31.834
So he thinks that if he takes you
to the prom, it'll help you win.

1103
01:10:35.038 --> 01:10:36.941
People have feelings, man.

1104
01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.962
Is that true?

1105
01:10:48.041 --> 01:10:53.056
Am I a bet? Am I a bet?
Am I a fucking bet!?

1106
01:10:57.697 --> 01:10:59.175
Yes.

1107
01:11:03.773 --> 01:11:07.036

<i>(Sighs)</i>

1131
01:12:42.479 --> 01:12:45.025
Did you know that some people
think being a pool man

1132
01:12:45.066 --> 01:12:47.846
is not a very respectable way
to earn a living?

1133
01:12:48.029 --> 01:12:49.434
People suck, Dad.

1134
01:12:49.634 --> 01:12:51.934
I don't get it, personally.

1135
01:12:51.976 --> 01:12:54.688
I own my own company
and my own home...

1136
01:12:54.772 --> 01:12:56.092
put the food on the table.

01:12:57.059 --> 01:12:59.696
Granted, you and Simon help out.

We're a team.

1139
01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:08.485
Right. Maybe this "team" thing
is helping to create confusion

1140
01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:11.423
as to who the real parent is
around here.

1141
01:13:11.564 --> 01:13:13.052
What do you mean, Dad?

1142
01:13:14.135 --> 01:13:18.850
Well, you know I appreciate
everything you do, pumpkin-nose.

1143
01:13:18.933 --> 01:13:23.857
It's just that sometimes
I think you take on so much

1144
01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:27.956
so you don't have to deal with
the business of being a kid.

1145
01:13:30.493 --> 01:13:35.041
I can't imagine being 17 is easy...

1146

especially with your mom not around.

1147
01:13:39.173 --> 01:13:44.555

01:24:53.022 --> 01:24:54.978
You did the right thing.

1308
01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:57.581
As for the rest of you...

1309
01:24:57.623 --> 01:24:59.584
- <i>(Microphone turns off)</i>
- Okay, what were you thinking?

1310
01:24:59.626 --> 01:25:03.197
<i>(Panting)</i>
Dean-- Th-The key--

1311
01:25:03.239 --> 01:25:04.642
- Say it.
- A ho-hotel--

1312
01:25:04.842 --> 01:25:07.313
- He's taking Laney somewhere.
- <i>Room 4-0-9!</i>

1313
01:25:07.555 --> 01:25:10.575
<i>(Taylor, microphone off) This isn't
funny anymore! Who turned this thing off?</i>

1314
01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:21.125
Yeah, Beverly Hills Hotel?

1315
01:25:21.408 --> 01:25:24.630
Yeah, do you have a Dean Sampson
registered in room 4-0-9?

1316
01:25:26.349 --> 01:25:28.485
You <i>have</i> a room 4-0-9?

1317
01:25:30.823 --> 01:25:32.202
- Shit.
- <i>(Dialing)</i>

1318
01:25:36.748 --> 01:25:38.210
Yeah, Sunset Marquee, please.

1319
01:25:41.522 --> 01:25:46.170
And that is the kidney-shaped pool.

1320
01:25:46.296 --> 01:25:47.773
- Hello?
- Mmm?

1321
01:25:47.999 --> 01:25:50.810
lf you're going to help me out this summer,
you're going to have to know this stuff, okay?

1322
01:25:50.935 --> 01:25:52.780
Wh-what shape is that?

1323
01:25:52.822 --> 01:25:54.483
- Kidney?
- Thank you.

1324
01:25:54.625 --> 01:25:58.050
<i>They come in a lot of different
shapes and sizes. Here's--</i>

1325
01:26:00.091 --> 01:26:02.345
Hey, pumpkin-nose, how did it go?

1326
01:26:03.605 --> 01:26:07.462
Fine. You were right.
I did have fun.

1327
01:26:08.503 --> 01:26:10.982
Well, hey, uh,
come here a second, will you?

1328
01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:18.143
I don't know, Dad. I'd really
just rather go upstairs and--

1329
01:26:25.296 --> 01:26:27.825
Okay, well, <i>(Grunts)</i> I got
to get up pretty early.

1330
01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:31.931
<i>We're</i> getting up early
to, uh, install a spa.

1331
01:26:32.056 --> 01:26:34.209
So, we'll head to bed now.

1332
01:26:34.293 --> 01:26:37.809
lf you two want to talk, maybe you can go
in the backyard, hmm? <i>(Kiss)</i>

1333
01:26:37.873 --> 01:26:40.001
- Sure, Dad.
- Good night.

1334
01:26:44.433 --> 01:26:49.741
Listen, Zack. Uh, sorry about
that whole asshole thing.

1335
01:26:50.083 --> 01:26:52.087
It's cool.

1336
01:26:59.706 --> 01:27:01.125
Are you all right?

1337
01:27:05.106 --> 01:27:07.695
Jesse told me he heard Dean
talking about how he wanted to--

1338
01:27:07.817 --> 01:27:11.139
I just figured it out
a little late is all.

1339
01:27:20.487 --> 01:27:23.417
You know, sexual harassment
is still a big issue these days.

1340
01:27:23.701 --> 01:27:25.920
It's on my walls downstairs.

1341
01:27:28.724 --> 01:27:30.861
That's why...

1342
01:27:31.228 --> 01:27:33.415
why I carry this.

1343
01:27:33.857 --> 01:27:37.195
You push a little button,
and it makes a noise like a foghorn.

1344
01:27:37.279 --> 01:27:40.092
You can hear it
about half a mile away.

1345
01:27:40.575 --> 01:27:42.896
I put it up to his ear.

1346
01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:47.904
I just hope it doesn't
cause any permanent damage.

1347
01:27:58.293 --> 01:28:00.463
So how long have you
been here anyway?

1348
01:28:00.905 --> 01:28:02.466
A while.

1349
01:28:04.319 --> 01:28:05.932
You missed your prom?

1350
01:28:06.182 --> 01:28:07.932
Yeah.

1351
01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:15.444
You know, I made that bet
before I knew you, Laney.

1352
01:28:16.196 --> 01:28:18.515
Before I really knew <i>me.</i>

1353
01:28:20.853 --> 01:28:25.041
What was it for anyway?
I mean, what did you end up losing?

1354
01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:28.590
My best friend.

1355
01:28:32.028 --> 01:28:34.005
She taught me a lot.

1356
01:28:34.431 --> 01:28:36.893
Before her...

1357
01:28:36.976 --> 01:28:39.939
I thought we had to have
all the answers right now.

1358
01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:42.444
And now?

1359
01:28:43.486 --> 01:28:47.008
I'm kind of liking the fact
that I don't.

1360
01:28:50.347 --> 01:28:51.710
So...

1361
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:54.010
Can I have the last dance?

1362
01:28:57.424 --> 01:28:58.902
No.

1363
01:29:03.283 --> 01:29:05.286
You can have the first.

1364
01:29:38.494 --> 01:29:42.459
I feel just like Julia Roberts
in <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

1365
01:29:42.642 --> 01:29:45.245
You know, except for
the whole hooker thing.

1366
01:29:49.419 --> 01:29:51.863
So... what now?

1367
01:29:53.341 --> 01:29:56.821
I don't know.
Art school. You?

1368
01:29:57.263 --> 01:29:59.808
I've been kind of thinking
about art school myself.

1369
01:30:00.869 --> 01:30:02.148
- Art?
- Yeah.

1370
01:30:02.548 --> 01:30:04.148
You don't take art.

1371
01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:07.554
Yeah, but I'm thinkin' more
along the lines of <i>performance</i> art.

1372
01:30:07.838 --> 01:30:10.992
- Be silent, be still. Be silent--
- Zack.

1373
01:30:11.117 --> 01:30:12.431
What?

1374
01:30:12.831 --> 01:30:14.531
Shut up.

1375
01:30:31.006 --> 01:30:33.585
- <i>Zack?
- What?</i>

1376
01:30:33.626 --> 01:30:36.088
- <i>About the bet...
- Yeah.</i>

1377
01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:39.594
- <i>What were the terms, anyway?
- You'll see.</i>

1378
01:30:39.635 --> 01:30:41.496
