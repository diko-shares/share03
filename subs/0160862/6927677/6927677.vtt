Simon! Simon,
I got your breakfast.

16
00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.612
Simon, you up?

17
00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:20.908
Give me a couple of minutes.

18
00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:23.704
Simon Boggs, there are
children in Mexico...

19
00:01:23.746 --> 00:01:27.084
who've already been up for three hours
making clothes for corporate America.

20
00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:30.506
- Leave me alone.
- That's it. I'm spitting in your juice.

21
00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:38.059
I got a big loogie,
and I'll spit it right in your juice.

22
00:01:42.148 --> 00:01:44.736
Good morning.

23
00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.906
Good morning, Laney.

24
00:01:53.374 --> 00:01:56.588
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, earthquakes,
Spring Break is officially over.</i>

25
00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:59.634
<i>Only two months left at Harrison High
until summer vacation.</i>

26
00:01:59.717 --> 00:02:03.089
<i>Until then, here's a little
welcome back music.</i>

27
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:15.867
Okay, I got a pump replacement
this afternoon out in Manhattan Beach...

28
00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.372
...so I'll try not to be late
picking you guys up.

29
00:02:18.913 --> 00:02:20.758
- Laney?
- Got it, Dad.

30
00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:24.128
Okay, have a good day, pumpkin-nose.

31
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.566
<i>I know.</i>

32
00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:51.787
- <i>Hey, Zack.</i>
- Hey.

33
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.382
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hello.

34
00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:59.214
What's happening, Connie?

35
00:02:59.256 --> 00:03:01.117
He spoke to me.

36
00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.687
- He called you Connie.
- So?

37
00:03:03.813 --> 00:03:05.299
Your name is Melissa.

38
00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:10.323
- Hey, Jesse.
- Hey, Laney.

39
00:03:10.407 --> 00:03:14.078
See that <i>Dateline</i> on sewage dumpers
last night? I taped it.

40
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.416
What happened to dropping
ten pounds before graduation?

41
00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:17.016
I'm looking into it.

42
00:03:17.058 --> 00:03:19.629
- Jesse, do not eat that.
- Twinkie Lite, see?

43
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.091
- Hey, yo!
- Hey, what's up, Siler?

44
00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:25.679
- What's up, Preston?
- What's up, bitch?

45
00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:28.000
How's it going, man?
Hey, guys, check it.

46
00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.785
Guess who jammed
a 30-year-old flight attendant...

47
00:03:29.852 --> 00:03:32.132
at 25,000 feet en route to Cancun?

48
00:03:32.157 --> 00:03:35.035
- Bullshit.
- I swear to God.

49
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.538
Come on, man. How was Vail?

50
00:03:36.563 --> 00:03:40.409
Fine. You know, skiing with
my parents, whatever. It was cool.

51
00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:41.612
Cool?

52
00:03:42.537 --> 00:03:47.211
Has it occurred to anyone that we have
eight weeks left in our high school careers?

53
00:03:47.253 --> 00:03:49.590
Shit. Only like every five minutes.

54
00:03:49.673 --> 00:03:51.293
- Well, it's weird, you know?
- No.

55
00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:53.497
See, I'm driving through the gate
this morning, and it hit me.

56
00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.895
Suddenly tomorrow is not just tomorrow.
It's like the future, you know?

57
00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:01.733
- No.
- Hey, guys, check it.

58
00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:05.614
Then could I please speak to somebody
who <i>doesn't</i> have his head up his ass?

59
00:04:05.655 --> 00:04:08.109
Well, well, well, check
who's back from spring break

60
00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:10.112
looking all fine and shit.

61
00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:12.703
Look, Dean, on behalf of
every black person, shut up.

62
00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:15.913
- Scusi! On the phone here.
- How you doing, baby?

63
00:04:15.938 --> 00:04:18.016
Yes, I'll hold. Get off me.

64
00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.194
Hey, you guys seen Taylor?

65
00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:22.889
Um... no.

66
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:27.104
- What?
- Taylor? My girlfriend?

67
00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:28.507
Yeah, come on, you know.

68
00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:32.654
- Tall, kind of yells at everybody.
- No. Why?

69
00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:35.659
Why? Uh, I don't know.

70
00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.780
Maybe because I haven't spoken to her
since you guys left for Daytona.

71
00:04:38.784 --> 00:04:41.083
Excuse me.

72
00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:44.130
- Hey, party people.
- Hi, Taylor.

73
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:46.341
Oh, my gosh, I've got total Diet Coke mouth.

74
00:04:46.425 --> 00:04:49.606
- Does anybody have any gum?
- <i>I got it. Me too. Here.</i>

75
00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:00.121
Listen, Zack, I've been
doing some thinking.

76
00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:04.744
I'm sorry. This?
It just isn't working for me anymore.

77
00:05:09.334 --> 00:05:11.212
New tattoo?

78
00:05:14.049 --> 00:05:15.927
Damn.

79
00:05:16.052 --> 00:05:20.851
So you show up after a week with
a tattoo and suddenly want to break up?

80
00:05:20.893 --> 00:05:23.397
What happened in Florida, Taylor?

81
00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:26.443
Look, if you want to
torture yourself...

82
00:05:28.237 --> 00:05:30.024
Oh, whatever. Okay.

83
00:05:30.107 --> 00:05:33.012
So we're at this club one night
and Chandler gets totally ploughed,

84
00:05:33.012 --> 00:05:36.417
and she starts making out with this old guy
for, like, 20 minutes on the dance floor.

85
00:05:36.484 --> 00:05:42.217
Well, imagine our surprise when this old guy
turns out to be Warren G.'s hairdresser.

86
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.920
- Isn't he gay?
- Whatever.

87
00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:47.450
So he sets us up with passes to
the spring break beach house, so we go.

88
00:05:48.192 --> 00:05:50.947
<i>Hey, hey. What's up?
How's it going?</i>

89
00:05:50.988 --> 00:05:54.728
<i>Welcome to spring break, live from
the beach house of Daytona, Florida.</i>

90
00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:56.231
<i>Beautiful weather, slamming bands,</i>

91
00:05:56.272 --> 00:06:00.807
<i>and, of course, 300 relative strangers from
all around this great nation of ours.</i>

92
00:06:00.812 --> 00:06:04.660
<i>Cutting loose, ha ha ha, half naked...</i>

93
00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:07.971
<i>and generally having a good time. Uh!</i>

94
00:06:09.358 --> 00:06:13.401
<i>The next thing I know, Taylor Vaughan
is handpicked by the director</i>

95
00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:16.894
- <i>to dance on her very own raft.
- Hey!</i>

96
00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:26.134
This is all fascinating, Taylor,

97
00:06:26.217 --> 00:06:29.905
but, uh, could you maybe skip to the
part where you decide to screw me over?

98
00:06:29.947 --> 00:06:31.708
Hold on.
I'm getting there. Okay.

99
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.331
So I've been dancing for maybe
five minutes, right? And I nearly fell off,

100
00:06:35.373 --> 00:06:39.119
which would have been so embarrassing,
and, you know, being on cable and everything.

101
00:06:39.144 --> 00:06:42.432
So I turn around to see what I've hit,
and <i>that's</i> when it happened.

102
00:06:42.474 --> 00:06:46.855
Hey, I'm Brock Hudson! Hey!

103
00:06:46.897 --> 00:06:49.860
Brock Hudson?
What kind of a name is that?

104
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:53.159
What kind of name is Zack?
Okay, Brock is from <i>The Real World.</i>

105
00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:54.459
What, like Reseda?

106
00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:59.082
No, like the TV show, okay?
<i>Real World, L.A.</i> Second season. Hello.

107
00:07:00.368 --> 00:07:02.754
The dyslexic volleyball guy?

108
00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.424
They kicked him out of the house.

109
00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:07.219
The next three days
were kind of a blur.

110
00:07:09.344 --> 00:07:12.143
I mean, it was like we had known
each other for weeks.

111
00:07:12.227 --> 00:07:16.149
He knew exactly what I was thinking,
and I didn't even have to say a word.

112
00:07:18.144 --> 00:07:21.365
So before I left, Brock said
he had a surprise for me...

113
00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:24.954
Something to record the wonderment
of our first days together.

114
00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:29.562
- So that's it?
- Pretty much, yeah.

115
00:07:29.745 --> 00:07:32.116
Oh, but don't worry, Zack. I mean,
I'll still go to the prom with you.

116
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:37.064
I mean, we're going to be elected. It's only
appropriate for the king and queen to go together.

117
00:07:38.766 --> 00:07:40.853
I-- I don't know what to say.

118
00:07:40.936 --> 00:07:43.157
Oh, so don't then, Zack.
I mean, it's been fun.

119
00:07:43.198 --> 00:07:47.822
But did you honestly think that I was going
to leave for college still dating you?

120
00:07:47.863 --> 00:07:49.908
Oh, my God, you did.

121
00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:54.081
No way. That is so sweet. Ow!

122
00:07:54.164 --> 00:07:56.919
Do you believe
this thing still hurts?

123
00:08:05.056 --> 00:08:07.184
Great.

124
00:08:09.896 --> 00:08:13.026
That's a very nice use
of color, Misty.

125
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.229
Thanks.

126
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:24.419
I read about this riot
in Mogadishu.

127
00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:29.551
- This represents the pain of that night.
- <i>That's wonderful, Laney.</i>

128
00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.679
But tell me something.

129
00:08:31.762 --> 00:08:34.725
Which part represents you?

130
00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:44.031
Laney,

131
00:08:44.673 --> 00:08:47.161
Savannah and I were just talking
about your stuff.

132
00:08:47.244 --> 00:08:52.252
Just about how you're not--
I don't know, you're not afraid to be dark.

133
00:08:52.377 --> 00:08:54.155
Darkness rocks.

134
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.877
But I'll be honest. I don't think
anybody here really appreciates that.

135
00:08:57.919 --> 00:09:01.557
- Uh-uh.
- Sav and I, we toured the Prado over break, and--

136
00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.136
That's in Spain.

137
00:09:03.536 --> 00:09:06.582
And, um, we got in this discussion
one day at the cafe...

138
00:09:06.665 --> 00:09:11.022
just about-- about how many artists are really
only truly appreciated posthumously.

139
00:09:11.105 --> 00:09:13.909
And we got Van Gogh, Pissarro.

140
00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:15.554
- Basquait.
- Basquait. Thank you.

141
00:09:15.579 --> 00:09:17.157
A-And then your name came up.

142
00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:20.419
And Sav thought--
Actually, we both thought that...

143
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:23.089
it might be a good idea for you if, um--

144
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:25.218
You killed yourself.

145
00:09:27.329 --> 00:09:29.182
Think about it.

146
00:09:39.322 --> 00:09:42.008
Well, check it out.
That's it for another day, earthquakes.

147
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:47.268
By the way, my condolences go out to a certain
individual who got dissed and dismissed...

148
00:09:47.268 --> 00:09:50.881
<i>by his long-time,
magically delicious girlfriend.</i>

149
00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:53.176
Relax, man.
No one knows it's you.

150
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.081
<i>Hey, hang in there, Zack.
It happens to the best of us.</i>

151
00:09:56.165 --> 00:09:57.833
<i>Keep that head up, all right, son?</i>

152
00:09:57.843 --> 00:10:02.703
As far as the other dude, if it doesn't kill you,
it only makes you stronger. All right?

153
00:10:02.858 --> 00:10:05.855
Yeah. You better do something, man,
'cause your legacy's in jeopardy here.

154
00:10:05.896 --> 00:10:09.802
I mean, one second
you're Zack Siler, Class President,

155
00:10:09.827 --> 00:10:12.906
standout athlete,
all-around bad-ass mamba-jahamba.

156
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:15.752
The next thing you know,
you're Zack Siler, bitch-boy.

157
00:10:20.842 --> 00:10:24.765
Hey, how are you guys?
Hey. Hey.

158
00:10:24.932 --> 00:10:27.686
- Brock.
- Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

159
00:10:27.853 --> 00:10:30.399
- Hi!
- Hey. Hey, baby.

160
00:10:40.414 --> 00:10:43.376
What's up? How's it going?

161
00:10:43.918 --> 00:10:46.457
Who the hell does
she think she is?

162
00:10:46.482 --> 00:10:50.554
There are 2,000 girls in this school, and I
can bump monkeys with every one of them.

163
00:10:50.637 --> 00:10:54.085
- Taylor Vaughan is totally replaceable.
- Spare me this wax shit...

164
00:10:54.169 --> 00:10:56.688
about replaceable, because we're
talking about Taylor Vaughan here.

165
00:10:56.772 --> 00:10:59.159
- Sorry, man. He's-- He's right.
- Of course I'm right.

166
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.862
I mean, the girl's
an institution in this place.

167
00:11:00.903 --> 00:11:03.516
Every girl wants to be her,
and every guy wants to nail her.

168
00:11:03.558 --> 00:11:07.621
Basically, she's you...
with tits.

169
00:11:08.463 --> 00:11:10.167
Nah, nah, you're wrong, you see.

170
00:11:10.534 --> 00:11:14.590
The Taylor Vaughan you just described
is an illusion, a myth.

171
00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.708
You strip away all that
attitude and makeup...

172
00:11:16.735 --> 00:11:19.498
and basically all you have is
a C minus G.P.A. with a Wonder Bra.

173
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.401
Oh, give it up.

174
00:11:21.643 --> 00:11:25.147
Take, uh--
Take her for example.

175
00:11:25.189 --> 00:11:26.892
Short, decent rack,

176
00:11:26.976 --> 00:11:30.280
kind of a Chelsea Clinton thing going on.

177
00:11:30.405 --> 00:11:33.034
But given the right look,

178
00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:34.562
the right boyfriend, bam!

179
00:11:34.846 --> 00:11:37.875
In six weeks, she's the one
being crowned prom queen.

180
00:11:37.917 --> 00:11:40.821
- You're serious?
- As a heart attack.

181
00:11:40.863 --> 00:11:44.728
You're clearly delusional. But how
about a chance to prove me wrong?

182
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.783
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Dean, Dean, Dean. The boy's bugging here.

183
00:11:48.967 --> 00:11:51.771
You're taking advantage of a friend
in a vulnerable situation.

184
00:11:51.855 --> 00:11:55.010
Gee, that's swell, Preston. A fifth of Chivas
and a uterus and you could be my mom.

185
00:11:55.051 --> 00:11:58.842
No, seriously. The guy thinks he
could do anything. Let him prove it.

186
00:12:00.325 --> 00:12:03.121
- What do you say, Zack?
- A bet?

187
00:12:03.163 --> 00:12:06.710
Yeah. Unless, of course,
you're too heartbroken.

188
00:12:07.937 --> 00:12:10.658
- Just name the terms.
- All right, it's simple.

189
00:12:10.742 --> 00:12:16.099
I'll pick the girl, and you got six weeks
to turn her into the prom queen.

190
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:19.039
Okay, okay, we get it, okay?

191
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.942
- <i>Everybody has a big jimmy. Now can we just--</i>
- You got it.

192
00:12:23.568 --> 00:12:28.043
All right. Let's go shopping.

193
00:12:28.784 --> 00:12:31.706
Oh, man, this is
going to be so much fun.

194
00:12:31.831 --> 00:12:33.822
- <i>What about her?
- Nah, I don't think so.</i>

195
00:12:33.835 --> 00:12:36.031
<i>I mean it's still scabbing.
See, I saved it.</i>

196
00:12:36.081 --> 00:12:37.581
Hey, how about this one?

197
00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:39.551
A-Are you sure about Bubbles?

198
00:12:39.635 --> 00:12:41.655
Nah, we can do better than that.

199
00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:45.268
<i>What about her?</i>

200
00:12:45.351 --> 00:12:48.856
Rectal archaeology. Very nice.

201
00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:53.590
Stupid, stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid.

202
00:12:57.345 --> 00:13:00.415
Gentlemen, we have a winner.

203
00:13:00.857 --> 00:13:02.628
<i>What, Laney Boggs?</i>

204
00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:04.439
Nuh-uh! No. No, no, no, no.

205
00:13:04.523 --> 00:13:06.526
Hey, a bet's a bet, bro. Right, Preston?

206
00:13:06.667 --> 00:13:09.929
Hey, man, this is between you guys.

207
00:13:15.455 --> 00:13:17.683
L-L-Look, fat I can handle.

208
00:13:17.708 --> 00:13:20.737
Weird boobs, bad personality,
maybe some sort of fungus.

209
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.453
Come on. Scary and inaccessible
is another story.

210
00:13:25.894 --> 00:13:28.558
Hey, man, if I were you,
I wouldn't be wasting my time.

211
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:31.337
'Cause by my calculations
you got six weeks until the prom.

212
00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:33.583
And if-- if Laney Boggs
is going to be queen,

213
00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:36.187
I'd say you pretty much got
your work cut out for you.

214
00:13:40.225 --> 00:13:43.104
- Hi, Laney. You got a second?
- <i>Here comes Zack.</i>

215
00:13:43.688 --> 00:13:45.942
What's up, Spaz?

216
00:13:46.584 --> 00:13:47.795
He knows my name.

217
00:13:47.837 --> 00:13:50.900
That's not your name.
That's not his name.

218
00:13:50.941 --> 00:13:53.244
Oh. Sorry.

219
00:13:55.188 --> 00:13:56.317
So, Laney, listen.

220
00:13:56.384 --> 00:14:00.255
- I was wondering if maybe you'd want to...
- Let's go, Simon.

221
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.593
embarrass me horribly
in front of all these people?

222
00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:07.124
- Laney--
- Come on. Dad's waiting. Let's go.

223
00:14:14.502 --> 00:14:17.356
Wait! Watch this.

224
00:14:17.498 --> 00:14:21.105
Oh! Damn it, Brock.

225
00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:23.395
Yeah! Good.

226
00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:27.221
Relax, man. Smells like roses.

227
00:14:27.321 --> 00:14:30.426
I will not relax.
You-- You are being disrespectful.

228
00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:33.422
You are disrespecting me
and you are disrespecting Harmony.

229
00:14:33.547 --> 00:14:36.151
It's not about disrespect.
It's just gas.

230
00:14:36.235 --> 00:14:41.050
- That's about enough of this.
- How's the queen of The Real World?

231
00:14:41.092 --> 00:14:43.046
How did you know about that?

232
00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:47.951
Please. They've only run that
spring break thing like a zillion times.

233
00:14:47.993 --> 00:14:50.602
So, uh, who's the lucky rebound skank?

234
00:14:50.775 --> 00:14:52.075
Rebound skank?

235
00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:57.591
- Well, there's got to be somebody, right?
- Well, I wouldn't say somebody, but...

236
00:14:57.674 --> 00:15:00.262
there is sort of a project.

237
00:15:00.387 --> 00:15:02.640
- "Project"?
- Yeah.

238
00:15:02.682 --> 00:15:07.105
To tell you the truth, she kind of, uh--
she kind of blew me off.

239
00:15:07.147 --> 00:15:08.633
I like her already.

240
00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:11.846
Well, the only thing I can figure
is it's got to be some kind of mistake.

241
00:15:11.887 --> 00:15:14.449
Zack, I realize it's a difficult concept

242
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.412
for a bitch magnet
such as yourself to grasp, but...

243
00:15:17.754 --> 00:15:21.661
did it ever occur to you
to make a little effort?

244
00:15:21.686 --> 00:15:23.257
What do you mean?

245
00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:25.257
Find out where she hangs out.

246
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:28.053
Find out what she likes.

247
00:15:28.437 --> 00:15:30.558
Oh, crap.
Mom and Dad are home.

248
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:33.979
lf they ask, I'm at Ashley's.

249
00:15:34.062 --> 00:15:36.850
Her brother's home.
He's so cute.

250
00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:40.948
He just got kicked out
of military school.

251
00:15:43.994 --> 00:15:46.315
Zachary, how was the first day back?

252
00:15:46.457 --> 00:15:48.918
Ah. School is school.

253
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.372
Taylor and the girls
have a good time in Florida?

254
00:15:51.514 --> 00:15:55.035
- I guess so.
- There's still no word on the Dartmouth application?

255
00:15:55.077 --> 00:15:56.380
Obviously not.

256
00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.284
You haven't heard from
a single university yet.

257
00:15:58.284 --> 00:16:01.139
Isn't that a bit unusual
at this point in the year?

258
00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:02.639
Not really.

259
00:16:02.764 --> 00:16:05.284
You know, maybe I ought to give
Ken Wortham in the Alumni office a buzz.

260
00:16:05.368 --> 00:16:10.909
- I owe him a call anyway.
- Nah, nah. Let's give it a couple of days.

261
00:16:10.951 --> 00:16:13.914
Probably hear something by Friday.

262
00:16:15.158 --> 00:16:18.170
We'll give it until the end of the week.

263
00:16:57.229 --> 00:16:59.733
Does my tattoo look red to you?

264
00:16:59.833 --> 00:17:02.456
Come on, girl. Don't you care
about anything anymore?

265
00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:04.656
What are we spewing about?

266
00:17:04.698 --> 00:17:09.113
Well, two weeks ago, we were helping you
plan your prom queen acceptance speech.

267
00:17:09.255 --> 00:17:12.044
Now, all of a sudden, everything's, like,
"Brock this" and "Brock that"...

268
00:17:12.068 --> 00:17:13.730
and "my tattoo."

269
00:17:14.171 --> 00:17:17.318
Taylor, the last thing you want to do
five weeks before the election...

270
00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:19.046
is alienate people.

271
00:17:19.129 --> 00:17:21.483
- And what is <i>that</i> supposed to mean?
- I think...

272
00:17:21.524 --> 00:17:25.938
what she's trying to say is
you should be careful. Right?

273
00:17:26.063 --> 00:17:27.541
Careful of what? Okay.

274
00:17:27.566 --> 00:17:29.412
I can win this thing
in fluorescent lighting...

275
00:17:29.495 --> 00:17:33.058
on the first day of my period,
cloaked in T.J. Maxx. Okay?

276
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.695
My mother was prom queen in '71.

277
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.674
My cousin, prom queen in '82.

278
00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:40.169
And my sister would have been
prom queen in '94...

279
00:17:40.211 --> 00:17:42.714
if it wasn't for that scandal
on the Color Me Badd tour bus, okay?

280
00:17:42.714 --> 00:17:45.109
I am a goddamn legacy, all right?

281
00:17:45.234 --> 00:17:48.865
And besides, not to be a bitch,
but who's going to beat Taylor Vaughan?

282
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.061
God, I hope that's not
your acceptance speech.

283
00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:57.545
Okay, sir, that will be one tahina kebab
with a side of spiced hummus salad.

284
00:17:57.645 --> 00:18:00.156
Would you like to super-size
those falafel balls?

285
00:18:00.198 --> 00:18:03.954
Hmm. Let me see.

286
00:18:03.954 --> 00:18:09.170
- Laney.
- Exactly what does this super-size entail?

287
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:12.091
Stalking is illegal in all 50 states.

288
00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:15.071
- Come on. I just want to talk.
- I find myself torn.

289
00:18:15.171 --> 00:18:17.549
Perhaps I could see
a sample ball...

290
00:18:17.633 --> 00:18:20.580
to better equip myself
for such a decision.

291
00:18:20.705 --> 00:18:25.277
- Don't you have a break coming up?
- One moment, sir.

292
00:18:25.361 --> 00:18:27.781
Uh, uh, miss?

293
00:18:27.864 --> 00:18:29.993
One moment, sir.

294
00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:32.196
I'm not smart.

295
00:18:32.222 --> 00:18:32.810
What?

296
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.310
What? You figure I could--
I could tutor you or something?

297
00:18:35.351 --> 00:18:38.360
- You think, "Oh, well, there's Laney Boggs. She's a dork.
- Look, Laney. Laney.

298
00:18:38.364 --> 00:18:40.626
She must at least be smart."
Well, guess what, I'm not.

299
00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:45.182
Laney! I have the fourth
highest G.P.A. in our class.

300
00:18:47.176 --> 00:18:48.805
Mm-hmm.

301
00:18:49.588 --> 00:18:53.903
Oh. What is this, some kind of new dork
outreach program? I'm just not, uh--

302
00:18:53.945 --> 00:18:56.308
- No, it-- Are you always like this?
- No.

303
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.450
Yes.

304
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.697
Come on. Five minutes.

305
00:19:00.781 --> 00:19:03.710
- <i>Miss?</i>
- Five seconds.

306
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.308
Okay. Um, I really
wanted to talk to you about...

307
00:19:10.161 --> 00:19:11.972
- Art.
- Art?

308
00:19:12.097 --> 00:19:15.127
- You don't take art.
- How do you know?

309
00:19:15.152 --> 00:19:17.856
How come I haven't seen you
in any of my classes?

310
00:19:17.898 --> 00:19:20.302
Well, 'cause I'm-- I'm busy
with soccer and stuff.

311
00:19:20.344 --> 00:19:23.298
So they let me take
one of those, uh-- the, uh--

312
00:19:23.398 --> 00:19:26.211
- Independent studies?
- Yes.

313
00:19:28.956 --> 00:19:33.021
But listen, I saw some of your stuff
in class. It's really good.

314
00:19:33.063 --> 00:19:36.802
So... any kind of help you could give me,
I'd appreciate it.

315
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:43.144
- Sure. I-- Maybe sometime.
- How about tonight?

316
00:19:44.872 --> 00:19:47.609
The show at the Jester.
You can have my ticket.

317
00:19:47.992 --> 00:19:49.446
That's great!

318
00:19:50.071 --> 00:19:52.366
One moment, please.

319
00:19:53.952 --> 00:19:56.197
- Ow!
- Look. I kicked your ass in third grade.

320
00:19:56.222 --> 00:19:59.503
- I'll do it again.
- Okay. One, I was sick that day.

321
00:19:59.528 --> 00:20:01.406
And two, are you crazy?

322
00:20:01.431 --> 00:20:03.409
I mean, the best-looking guy
in school's stalking you,

323
00:20:03.434 --> 00:20:05.314
and you're not the least bit curious?

324
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:15.752
Okay, here's the deal. The show's at 7:30.
Parking can be a problem.

325
00:20:15.893 --> 00:20:19.115
Meet me there at 7:00.
Don't be late.

326
00:20:20.659 --> 00:20:22.620
7:00 it is.

327
00:20:22.662 --> 00:20:24.267
Hey, do you want to maybe go
have some dinner before--

328
00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:25.467
No.

329
00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:28.629
I'll see you at 7:00.

330
00:20:28.671 --> 00:20:30.601
I'm sorry, sir.
Have you made your decision?

331
00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:34.288
Yes, I have.
Super-size my balls.

332
00:21:07.872 --> 00:21:13.196
<i>Snug in the putrid womb of
a mother he never knew.</i>

333
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.369
The fetus...
rising, floating.

334
00:21:17.452 --> 00:21:21.175
That's Mitch.
Brilliant, isn't he?

335
00:21:21.258 --> 00:21:25.673
Bursting forth!
Rushing forward!

336
00:21:25.714 --> 00:21:28.795
Surging! Emerging!

337
00:21:40.987 --> 00:21:45.202
My soul is an island.
My car is a Ford.

338
00:21:46.579 --> 00:21:48.582
I want to be like Mike.

339
00:21:50.084 --> 00:21:54.007
<i>Falling! Plunging!
Nay, expunging!</i>

340
00:21:56.093 --> 00:21:58.514
Whoo-hoo!
Aah-ah-ah!

341
00:22:30.995 --> 00:22:33.691
Be silent, be still.

342
00:22:33.733 --> 00:22:37.572
<i>Be silent, be still.</i>

343
00:22:37.614 --> 00:22:41.077
<i>Be silent, be still.</i>

344
00:22:41.161 --> 00:22:44.708
<i>Be silent, be still.</i>

345
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.630
<i>Be silent, be still.</i>

346
00:22:48.714 --> 00:22:52.261
<i>Be silent, be still.</i>

347
00:23:04.087 --> 00:23:06.407
Oh!

348
00:23:07.659 --> 00:23:09.620
Thank you very much.

349
00:23:09.662 --> 00:23:11.748
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

350
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.161
<i>Um, before you leave,
our performer, Laney,</i>

351
00:23:14.186 --> 00:23:18.007
has just informed me that there is
an exciting new voice among us.

352
00:23:18.009 --> 00:23:20.338
Is there a Zack Siler
in the house?

353
00:23:23.222 --> 00:23:25.286
Come on. Don't be shy.

354
00:23:26.108 --> 00:23:27.590
We're all friends here.

355
00:23:29.893 --> 00:23:33.281
Look, you don't have to go
if you're not interested.

356
00:23:33.448 --> 00:23:36.744
Art is love, people.
Art is love.

357
00:23:40.976 --> 00:23:43.212
Welcome, friend.

358
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:03.660
How's it going?

359
00:24:19.808 --> 00:24:21.979
It's a hacky sack.

360
00:24:30.317 --> 00:24:34.998
Whew! Hacky sack.

361
00:24:36.293 --> 00:24:39.255
Hacky sack.

362
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.512
<i>Bounce.</i>

363
00:24:45.496 --> 00:24:46.725
<i>Bounce.</i>

364
00:24:47.308 --> 00:24:49.537
<i>You got to keep bouncing.</i>

365
00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:54.611
Can't let it drop.

366
00:24:56.447 --> 00:24:58.485
Never let it drop.

367
00:25:02.021 --> 00:25:04.109
<i>Come on, Zack.</i>

368
00:25:04.709 --> 00:25:06.072
<i>Everyone's watching.</i>

369
00:25:08.791 --> 00:25:10.669
Expecting.

370
00:25:12.588 --> 00:25:16.310
Never... let it...

371
00:25:20.542 --> 00:25:22.112
drop.

372
00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:28.204
Everyone's counting on you, Zack!

373
00:25:34.212 --> 00:25:35.573
Don't let it drop!

374
00:25:37.425 --> 00:25:40.596
Don't... ever...

375
00:25:40.638 --> 00:25:42.599
let it...

376
00:25:45.646 --> 00:25:47.732
drop!

377
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.007
Sooner or later...

378
00:26:07.019 --> 00:26:09.682
it has to drop.

379
00:26:25.914 --> 00:26:28.853
Oh, man, I can't believe
I just did that!

380
00:26:28.978 --> 00:26:31.691
Well, I'd be lying if I didn't say
I was a little surprised myself.

381
00:26:31.775 --> 00:26:36.097
- So, tell me the truth. How bad did I suck?
- You were good.

382
00:26:36.181 --> 00:26:39.118
Come on! That thing you did
with the paint and all the garbage,

383
00:26:39.202 --> 00:26:40.721
that was really good.

384
00:26:40.805 --> 00:26:43.508
All I did was kick around a beanbag.

385
00:26:43.792 --> 00:26:45.278
All right, a little.

386
00:26:45.903 --> 00:26:49.491
A lot. You sucked a lot.
Boy, you really blew.

387
00:26:49.533 --> 00:26:51.512
- You feel better now?
- I don't care.

388
00:26:51.595 --> 00:26:54.015
Oh, man, I-I've given,
speeches and stuff,

389
00:26:54.099 --> 00:26:57.312
but, being up there and not knowing
what to do, it--

390
00:26:57.496 --> 00:27:00.017
- Bit of a rush, isn't it?
- Yeah.

391
00:27:00.758 --> 00:27:02.071
Whew!

392
00:27:08.937 --> 00:27:10.135
What?

393
00:27:10.635 --> 00:27:12.735
Do you always wear those glasses?

394
00:27:12.818 --> 00:27:14.141
Yeah. Why?

395
00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:16.741
No reason.

396
00:27:19.044 --> 00:27:21.122
You ever think about contacts?

397
00:27:22.207 --> 00:27:25.963
Mm, I have them.
I just never wear 'em.

398
00:27:26.088 --> 00:27:28.517
I don't know.
The idea of touching my eye is--

399
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.224
Because your eyes
are really... beautiful.

400
00:27:33.707 --> 00:27:37.522
- Oh, please.
- What?

401
00:27:37.647 --> 00:27:40.735
"Your eyes are really beautiful"?

402
00:27:41.118 --> 00:27:44.031
You really broke out the big guns
with that one, didn't you?

403
00:27:44.115 --> 00:27:47.395
- Laney, I was just--
- No. I had an instinct. I went against it.

404
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.748
This is my fault.

405
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.586
Wha-- Laney, I'm not following.

406
00:27:53.629 --> 00:27:55.216
You want to know about art?

407
00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:59.322
When the class president starts touching
my face on darkened street corners

408
00:27:59.322 --> 00:28:02.326
and talking about my eyes,
there's a word for it.

409
00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:05.873
There's an entire movement in the '20s.
It's called "surreal".

410
00:28:05.998 --> 00:28:10.112
- Laney, wait. Can't we just--
- You go. I'm going to catch a ride with Mitch.

411
00:28:10.196 --> 00:28:11.757
The underwear guy?

412
00:28:14.202 --> 00:28:18.667
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
It's on. It's on.

413
00:28:18.708 --> 00:28:21.146
Hey, this is great. Listen.

414
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.092
<i>I got a question for you. Oh!</i>

415
00:28:24.633 --> 00:28:26.136
<i>All right, this guy--</i>

416
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.784
<i>Would you kiss him for like, say, 500 bucks on,
like, a public access channel?</i>

417
00:28:29.826 --> 00:28:32.230
Oh, wait, wait, wait. This is
where I get sensitive.

418
00:28:32.896 --> 00:28:36.819
<i>My whole problem in the house
is that I was an only child.</i>

419
00:28:36.944 --> 00:28:38.823
<i>I didn't have a lot of friends,
never had roommates before.</i>

420
00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:42.028
<i>So I don't know how to, like,
deal with everyone.</i>

421
00:28:42.153 --> 00:28:45.191
<i>A lot of people here in this house
think I'm cold and insensitive.</i>

422
00:28:45.233 --> 00:28:48.304
<i>But underneath that, I've got,
like, a big-- This is big.</i>

423
00:28:48.346 --> 00:28:51.257
- Hey, you ho.
- <i>-off.</i>

424
00:28:51.999 --> 00:28:53.719
<i>See what I mean?</i>

425
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:56.091
Ah! Uh, baby, can you not
do that right now?

426
00:28:56.174 --> 00:28:58.653
I'm, like, I'm reading for
the new Spelling drama at 2:00,

427
00:28:58.687 --> 00:29:01.043
and I really-- you know,
I don't want to smell like your spit.

428
00:29:01.282 --> 00:29:06.631
It's like all over.
So... just stop. Thank you. Watch.

429
00:29:07.156 --> 00:29:09.552
- Oh, God.
- <i>...from my mom's sister...</i>

430
00:29:09.594 --> 00:29:11.155
- <i>who once went to a--
- Uhh, your aunt?</i>

431
00:29:11.197 --> 00:29:14.059
- <i>Yes. Yes, yes, my aunt.</i>
- This is where I-- Watch this.

432
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.256
This is where I get
Brando on them. Watch.

433
00:29:18.298 --> 00:29:19.015
Very Brando.

434
00:29:19.316 --> 00:29:24.015
<i>Do me a favor. Why don't you all
just stay out of my closet!</i>

435
00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.727
<i>God!</i>

436
00:29:30.083 --> 00:29:31.644
- Mornin'.
- Morning.

437
00:29:31.686 --> 00:29:33.040
Zack Siler.

438
00:29:33.047 --> 00:29:34.047
Pleasure.

439
00:29:34.189 --> 00:29:36.509
- Nice truck.
- Thanks.

440
00:29:36.693 --> 00:29:40.002
Yuck! I get a lot of stuff
out of people's pool drains.

441
00:29:40.014 --> 00:29:43.653
You never know what you're going to find.
I got this over at the university.

442
00:29:43.736 --> 00:29:45.753
At one of the fraternities, I found this.
Belonged to a football player,

443
00:29:45.756 --> 00:29:49.970
- who's actually a Heisman trophy runner-up.
- No kidding.

444
00:29:50.095 --> 00:29:53.225
- Zack, my man.
- Simon, hey.

445
00:29:53.392 --> 00:29:56.105
Hey, you want to play
some Sega? Sega!

446
00:29:57.189 --> 00:29:59.852
- Maybe later.
- Loves Sega.

447
00:29:59.952 --> 00:30:01.382
Would you excuse us a minute?

448
00:30:01.582 --> 00:30:02.982
What did <i>I</i> do?

449
00:30:03.407 --> 00:30:04.621
Not you, him.

450
00:30:04.721 --> 00:30:06.121
What did <i>I</i> do?

451
00:30:07.204 --> 00:30:09.750
- Hey, give me a hand here, will you?
- <i>Yeah, sure.</i>

452
00:30:09.792 --> 00:30:13.014
Look, you can't just keep
showing up like this.

453
00:30:13.055 --> 00:30:16.468
And you can't keep avoiding me.
Like the other night. What was that?

454
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.240
- I was busy.
- Yeah. Busy wigging.

455
00:30:19.323 --> 00:30:22.895
- Excuse me. I did not wig.
- There was major wiggage.

456
00:30:23.978 --> 00:30:28.027
- So, you want to go to the beach?
- No.

457
00:30:28.153 --> 00:30:31.709
- You hate the beach?
- Yes. No.

458
00:30:31.872 --> 00:30:33.996
- I don't have time for this.
- Fine.

459
00:30:34.046 --> 00:30:36.016
- I'm leaving.
- Fine.

460
00:30:38.209 --> 00:30:42.007
- Simon, how about that Sega?
- Yeah.

461
00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:44.428
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting ready to play some Sega.

462
00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:46.390
- No, you're not.
- Look, I believe I was invited.

463
00:30:46.473 --> 00:30:47.680
I am uninviting you.

464
00:30:47.685 --> 00:30:49.385
You're not the boss of him.

465
00:30:50.829 --> 00:30:54.317
The man does have a point.

466
00:30:54.442 --> 00:30:59.950
Yep, looks like
a long afternoon of Sega.

467
00:30:59.992 --> 00:31:04.457
And, hey, maybe your dad
can show me some more pool stuff.

468
00:31:04.999 --> 00:31:07.128
I'll get my suit.

469
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:14.292
<i>Well, once the clouds lifted,</i>

470
00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:16.926
<i>it turned out to be
a pretty okay day.</i>

471
00:31:19.104 --> 00:31:20.890
Check out that water.

472
00:31:21.232 --> 00:31:25.981
Do you know how many gallons of chemicals
are dumped into the oceans each year?

473
00:31:26.007 --> 00:31:28.994
Don't you ever just kick back?

474
00:31:29.035 --> 00:31:31.807
I mean, I know the world
has its problems.

475
00:31:32.049 --> 00:31:34.296
But would it hurt you
to smile once in a while?

476
00:31:35.296 --> 00:31:36.496
I smile.

477
00:31:36.622 --> 00:31:39.998
It's just you mentioned the ocean,
and I saw this thing on CNN--

478
00:31:40.011 --> 00:31:44.016
- No, forget CNN.
- <i>Hey, yo, Siler, what's up?</i>

479
00:31:44.016 --> 00:31:45.978
<i>Great. Okay.</i>

480
00:31:46.078 --> 00:31:50.752
Listen. lf we're going to be friends, we have
to deal with them sooner or later, right?

481
00:31:54.031 --> 00:31:55.193
Come on.

482
00:31:58.295 --> 00:31:59.809
Yeah, so I called your house,

483
00:31:59.849 --> 00:32:00.744
and they said
you were at the beach,

484
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:04.257
so I figured...
you must be at your spot.

485
00:32:05.341 --> 00:32:08.011
- You know, many a woman has lost it here.
- Shut up, Dean.

486
00:32:08.136 --> 00:32:11.541
Uh, you, uh, have to forgive our man here.
His shorts are kind of tight.

487
00:32:11.624 --> 00:32:14.701
Cuts off the circulation to his brain.
I'm Preston.

488
00:32:14.705 --> 00:32:16.691
I know who you are.

489
00:32:17.233 --> 00:32:20.323
Hey, Laney. It <i>is</i> Laney, right?

490
00:32:20.823 --> 00:32:21.623
Yeah.

491
00:32:21.648 --> 00:32:24.118
Well, come on, Zack, help us get
the rest of the stuff from the car.

492
00:32:24.201 --> 00:32:25.621
Yeah.

493
00:32:32.172 --> 00:32:35.510
Sooo... think the mourning
period's over yet?

494
00:32:35.552 --> 00:32:38.139
Please. It's way over.

495
00:32:38.264 --> 00:32:40.267
"Mourning period"?

496
00:32:40.267 --> 00:32:42.918
Yeah, without Taylor, uh,
Zack's available now.

497
00:32:43.031 --> 00:32:47.153
Yeah, but what's the deal? I mean,
don't tell me you guys are on a date.

498
00:32:47.236 --> 00:32:50.242
- No, we're just--
- Friends?

499
00:32:55.916 --> 00:32:58.630
Hey, now, check out
the bobos on super freak.

500
00:32:59.713 --> 00:33:03.928
You know, Zack, from up here,
she almost looks normal.

501
00:33:08.476 --> 00:33:10.948
So, is this what you ladies
gonna do all day?

502
00:33:11.132 --> 00:33:15.237
No. In 15 minutes, I have
every intention of turning over.

503
00:33:15.337 --> 00:33:17.993
All right. Just thought
you all might want to play.

504
00:33:18.288 --> 00:33:19.693
No, thanks.

505
00:33:21.035 --> 00:33:25.669
- So, what about you, Laney?
- No, um, I don't think so.

506
00:33:25.752 --> 00:33:30.301
- Is your name Laney?
- No. Thank God. No offense.

507
00:33:30.726 --> 00:33:32.004
None taken.

508
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:35.217
It's just I've seen you in gym class.
You run like a girl.

509
00:33:35.258 --> 00:33:37.005
I am a girl.

510
00:33:37.105 --> 00:33:39.105
Oh, you know what I mean.

511
00:33:39.189 --> 00:33:41.034
Obviously, I don't.

512
00:33:43.338 --> 00:33:46.742
So, uh, you in or out?

513
00:33:50.139 --> 00:33:51.116
In.

514
00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:53.252
Ah, lovely. Ha ha ha!

515
00:33:54.454 --> 00:33:57.550
- Me too.
- <i>Really?</i>

516
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.991
- Got it!
- Mine! Mine!

517
00:34:15.093 --> 00:34:17.206
Just like that.

518
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.993
So, Zack, my house tonight?

519
00:34:43.118 --> 00:34:45.205
Uh... yeah.

520
00:34:45.346 --> 00:34:47.901
So what about you, Laney?
See you at Preston's tonight?

521
00:34:47.926 --> 00:34:50.705
- I don't think so.
- Aw, come on. You got to be.

522
00:34:50.747 --> 00:34:52.876
Yeah, you should.
Preston's parties are the best.

523
00:34:52.959 --> 00:34:55.279
- Booze, tunes, hotties.
- Dean--

524
00:34:55.362 --> 00:34:58.208
No, seriously. His house is enormous.
His dad owns Harrison Ford.

525
00:34:58.233 --> 00:35:00.520
- The actor?
- No, the car dealership.

526
00:35:00.762 --> 00:35:03.482
So, what do you say?

527
00:35:03.524 --> 00:35:06.236
Uh, sure.

528
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.448
Good things.

529
00:35:09.492 --> 00:35:12.488
- Well, this should be interesting.
- Will you shut up?

530
00:35:12.513 --> 00:35:18.463
What? Even if they are broken up, if Zack shows
up with her, Taylor's going to shit Frisbees.

531
00:35:18.504 --> 00:35:21.225
<i>Zack, Laney, always a pleasure.</i>

532
00:35:21.267 --> 00:35:24.063
- Okay, man, see you.
- Later.

533
00:35:24.063 --> 00:35:25.776
- <i>See you guys later.
- See you.</i>

534
00:35:25.783 --> 00:35:28.045
<i>Bye. See you later. Bye.</i>

535
00:35:32.025 --> 00:35:35.822
Well, we survived, right?

536
00:35:38.409 --> 00:35:42.207
So, about Preston's thing tonight...

537
00:35:42.248 --> 00:35:45.045
- I can't.
- But you just said that--

538
00:35:45.128 --> 00:35:48.174
I-- I know. I just...

539
00:35:48.257 --> 00:35:50.928
forgot I have to clean the house.

540
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:55.936
It's really dirty.
Almost... unliveable.

541
00:35:57.521 --> 00:35:59.691
Sorry to hear that.

542
00:36:11.643 --> 00:36:15.432
<i>Thomas Welch invented
this drink in 1869</i>

543
00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:17.443
<i>as an alternative to wine.</i>

544
00:36:17.569 --> 00:36:20.047
- What is non-alcoholic wine?
- <i>What is grape juice?</i>

545
00:36:20.072 --> 00:36:21.550
- No.
- <i>That's right.</i>

546
00:36:21.675 --> 00:36:24.529
- <i>You said no?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

547
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:27.333
- <i>Why?</i>
- I said I had stuff to do.

548
00:36:27.375 --> 00:36:29.370
Laney, sitting around
with your father

549
00:36:29.395 --> 00:36:33.993
while he watches <i>Jeopardy!</i> in his
underwear hardly qualifies as "stuff to do".

550
00:36:34.034 --> 00:36:37.407
- Who is Lou Rawls?
- You know me too well.

551
00:36:37.448 --> 00:36:40.211
I think you're afraid to let
anything good happen to you.

552
00:36:40.253 --> 00:36:43.499
I mean, did it ever occur to you
that maybe Zack <i>really</i> likes you?

553
00:36:43.524 --> 00:36:45.961
Trust me. He doesn't.

554
00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:48.916
- I got to go.
- <i>The youngest of the Marx brothers,</i>

555
00:36:48.916 --> 00:36:52.821
- <i>he retired from the act following 1933's.</i>
- Who is Lamo?

556
00:36:52.888 --> 00:36:56.727
- <i>Who is Zeppo?
- That's correct. Pick again.</i>

557
00:36:56.889 --> 00:36:57.858
Hello.

558
00:36:58.858 --> 00:37:01.158
I thought I said I was busy.

559
00:37:01.284 --> 00:37:04.330
Zack. <i>Mi compadre con queso.</i>

560
00:37:06.041 --> 00:37:09.212
- I, uh-- I believe you said you were cleaning.
- I am.

561
00:37:09.254 --> 00:37:11.508
I was. I... will be.

562
00:37:11.608 --> 00:37:15.006
Tell you what.
How about I save you some time?

563
00:37:16.348 --> 00:37:20.020
- <i>I'll take the kitchen.
- All right, then I got the bathroom.</i>

564
00:37:20.062 --> 00:37:23.692
- Isn't... that... the soccer... team?
- It's J.V.

565
00:37:25.278 --> 00:37:27.448
- I need the vacuum cleaner.
- <i>It's over there in the corner.</i>

566
00:37:28.525 --> 00:37:32.239
- Go get dressed.
- I can't. I mean-- look at you.

567
00:37:32.306 --> 00:37:36.629
You look great.
I-- I have nothing--

568
00:37:37.212 --> 00:37:39.132
Oh, God.

569
00:37:42.804 --> 00:37:44.041
I'm a mess.

570
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:50.041
That's where I come in.
Mackenzie Siler, hair and makeup.

571
00:37:50.182 --> 00:37:51.644
You can call me Mack.

572
00:37:51.685 --> 00:37:55.448
You know, if you guys need us,
we'll be upstairs.

573
00:37:57.785 --> 00:37:59.913
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

574
00:38:00.333 --> 00:38:04.962
<i>This city's French Quarter
encompasses about 70 blocks.</i>

575
00:38:05.004 --> 00:38:07.124
- What is Paris, France?
- <i>What is New Orleans?</i>

576
00:38:07.208 --> 00:38:08.627
Ow!

577
00:38:08.711 --> 00:38:13.117
Laney, no offence, but...
when was the last time you tweezed?

578
00:38:13.284 --> 00:38:16.071
- What?
- As in your eyebrows?

579
00:38:16.138 --> 00:38:17.216
Never. Why?

580
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:21.087
Well... do you ever
watch <i>Sesame Street?</i>

581
00:38:21.129 --> 00:38:23.090
Uh-huh.

582
00:38:23.232 --> 00:38:25.493
- You know Bert?
- Ow!

583
00:38:25.535 --> 00:38:28.539
So, Zack, can I get you a drink?

584
00:38:28.623 --> 00:38:31.335
Yeah, sure.
What do you got?

585
00:38:32.229 --> 00:38:33.974
Let me check.

586
00:38:34.858 --> 00:38:38.046
<i>Along with presidents Washington,
Jefferson and Lincoln,</i>

587
00:38:38.071 --> 00:38:41.117
<i>his face appears on South Dakota's
Mount Rushmore.</i>

588
00:38:41.242 --> 00:38:43.721
- <i>Who is President Rushmore?
- Who is Roosevelt?</i>

589
00:38:43.746 --> 00:38:46.433
<i>All right, that's right.
Now you select again.</i>

590
00:38:46.775 --> 00:38:48.028
<i>The Cinema for 300.</i>

591
00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.576
<i>Here's the clue:
This 1961 Elia Kazan film</i>

592
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.196
<i>marked Warren Beatty's screen debut.</i>

593
00:38:55.238 --> 00:38:58.167
- What is <i>Shampoo?</i>
- <i>What is</i> Splendor in the Grass?

594
00:38:58.251 --> 00:38:59.754
You really never wear makeup?

595
00:38:59.854 --> 00:39:03.634
No. My mom died before I was
old enough for this stuff.

596
00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:05.540
- I'm sorry.
- It was a long time ago,

597
00:39:05.546 --> 00:39:08.675
I mean, God, Simon
was practically a baby.

598
00:39:08.717 --> 00:39:12.981
Nothing personal, Laney,
but this particular coif...

599
00:39:13.023 --> 00:39:16.027
doesn't really go with your face shape.

600
00:39:16.727 --> 00:39:18.240
What do you have in mind?

601
00:39:18.381 --> 00:39:21.243
Well, I have an idea.

602
00:39:21.285 --> 00:39:23.288
What kind of idea?

603
00:39:23.572 --> 00:39:25.093
You'd really have to trust me.

604
00:39:25.934 --> 00:39:29.999
<i>In 1987, a copy of the Old Testament
attributed to this printer</i>

<i>sold for $5.3 million.</i>

606
00:39:32.961 --> 00:39:35.001
- Who is Hewlett-Packard?
- Who is Gutenberg?

607
00:39:35.015 --> 00:39:36.959
- <i>Who is Gutenberg?
- Yes.</i>

608
00:39:37.026 --> 00:39:38.446
<i>1880's for 400.</i>

609
00:39:38.529 --> 00:39:41.791
- <i>According to the 1880 census,</i>
- Who are you people?

610
00:39:41.875 --> 00:39:45.029
<i>it was the first state with a
population exceeding 5 million.</i>

611
00:39:46.064 --> 00:39:49.426
- <i>Zack owes us big-time.
- So hard.</i>

612
00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:55.095
You sure this is a margarita?

613
00:39:55.837 --> 00:39:57.341
Yeah.

Hey, hey, hey, hey,
welcome, my friends...

00:41:38.249 --> 00:41:41.796
Yeah. At least until my folks
get back from Vegas.

00:41:42.138 --> 00:41:46.294
- Who are all these people?
- <i>I have no idea.</i>

631
00:41:46.578 --> 00:41:47.739
I have to check on you
in a second.

632
00:41:47.781 --> 00:41:50.802
Have a good time, all right?
Damn.

633
00:41:56.476 --> 00:41:59.581
Laney. Oh, my God, you look great.

634
00:41:59.623 --> 00:42:02.878
Zack, do you mind if I borrow her
for just a second?

635
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.549
There is amazing looking
twins over there.

636
00:42:05.632 --> 00:42:08.327
I think they're Costa Rican or something.

637
00:42:08.769 --> 00:42:11.457
Uh, sure.

638
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:13.398
Go ahead.

639
00:42:13.452 --> 00:42:17.049
Well, <i>gracias, papi.</i>

640
00:42:17.174 --> 00:42:20.011
Oh, my God, I'm so glad you came here.

641
00:42:20.411 --> 00:42:22.866
Damn, look at the look you have.

642
00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:26.354
So what's going on, man?
You guys come here together or what?

643
00:42:26.838 --> 00:42:29.043
Well, I brought her here
if that's what you mean.

644
00:42:29.626 --> 00:42:32.498
"I brought her here if that's what you mean."
Come on, man, let's get real.

645
00:42:32.681 --> 00:42:36.595
You're with her 24-7. You know I may
be wasted, but I'm not blind here.

646
00:42:36.637 --> 00:42:40.860
So what's going on? Mixing a little
business with pleasure or what?

647
00:42:41.544 --> 00:42:46.252
I hate to break it to you, man,
but, uh, it's just a bet.

648
00:42:47.452 --> 00:42:49.013
Yeah, right.

649
00:42:49.413 --> 00:42:50.783
Whoot-whoot!

650
00:42:50.825 --> 00:42:52.786
<i>Let's party!</i>

651
00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:56.534
Well, well, if it isn't Taylor Vaughan.

652
00:42:57.276 --> 00:42:58.598
What a surprise.

653
00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:01.023
Yeah, I mean, we almost didn't make it,

654
00:43:01.048 --> 00:43:06.331
but then I thought, you know, why not
put in one last sentimental... whatever.

655
00:43:06.656 --> 00:43:09.961
Honey! I want a beer.

656
00:43:10.045 --> 00:43:14.485
- You've got a drink right there.
- But I <i>want</i> a beer.

657
00:43:14.569 --> 00:43:15.965
Okay.

658
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:20.870
Excuse me.

659
00:43:26.828 --> 00:43:28.090
Hello?

660
00:43:28.631 --> 00:43:32.286
- Oh. Sorry.
- Splatter girl?

661
00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.001
Misty?

662
00:43:41.383 --> 00:43:43.204
Are... you okay?

663
00:43:45.514 --> 00:43:47.685
I think I'm going to vomit.

664
00:43:48.269 --> 00:43:50.522
I think you already did.

665
00:44:00.287 --> 00:44:02.290
Can I get you something?

666
00:44:12.179 --> 00:44:13.657
Here.

667
00:44:17.522 --> 00:44:18.922
Hey, Laney.

668
00:44:20.066 --> 00:44:22.181
<i>How does it feel?</i>

669
00:44:22.481 --> 00:44:24.081
Excuse me?

670
00:44:24.364 --> 00:44:26.260
You heard me.

671
00:44:26.385 --> 00:44:29.606
I said, "How does it feel?"

672
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:34.338
Rich girl like me...

673
00:44:34.463 --> 00:44:38.219
gets a scholarship to her
first-choice art school,

674
00:44:39.302 --> 00:44:41.056
and here you are...

675
00:44:41.181 --> 00:44:43.643
cleaning up my puke.

676
00:44:56.297 --> 00:44:58.374
- Taylor.
- <i>Zack.</i>

677
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.795
Hey, you know, Brock
will be back in a minute.

678
00:45:00.836 --> 00:45:04.041
I can get you an introduction
or maybe an autograph.

679
00:45:04.066 --> 00:45:08.305
No, that's okay.
I saw him on a rerun last night.

680
00:45:08.347 --> 00:45:12.045
He ate his own toenail clippings
for ten bucks. Very impressive.

681
00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:14.425
Jump up my ass, Zack.

682
00:45:14.725 --> 00:45:18.525
- I've been there, done that.
- <i>Go, deejay! Get funky, deejay!</i>

683
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.041
Can you guys back up a little?

684
00:45:21.183 --> 00:45:25.665
- Speaking of ass-jumping, isn't that your boy now?
- <i>You guys back up a little.</i>

685
00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:28.444
Oh, God, not again. Brock!

686
00:45:28.469 --> 00:45:30.089
- Go, deejay!
- Brock!

687
00:45:30.115 --> 00:45:33.054

- I was invited.

714
00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:35.985
Really? Isn't your dad my pool man?

715
00:47:36.155 --> 00:47:37.755
I really wouldn't know.

716
00:47:39.249 --> 00:47:41.636
Oopsy.

717
00:47:41.761 --> 00:47:47.294
- Ah!
- You really should be more careful with silk.

718
00:47:52.776 --> 00:47:54.054
Thank you.

719
00:47:54.379 --> 00:47:56.850
- Excuse me?
- Thank you.

720
00:47:57.217 --> 00:48:01.767
For a minute there, I forgot why I avoided
places like this and people like you.

721
00:48:01.892 --> 00:48:06.080
Avoided us?
Honey, look around you.

722
00:48:06.164 --> 00:48:08.927
To everyone here who matters, you're vapor.

723
00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:13.500
You're Spam, a waste of
perfectly good yearbook space.

724
00:48:13.541 --> 00:48:16.013
Nothing's gonna change that.

725
00:48:17.256 --> 00:48:21.345
Oh. You're not gonna cry,
are you?

726
00:48:36.367 --> 00:48:38.287
- Laney--
- Don't touch me!

727
00:48:42.858 --> 00:48:44.296
Laney.

728
00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:48.745
I promised myself...

729
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:53.810
I would never, ever... ever--

730
00:48:56.055 --> 00:48:57.317
Never what?

731
00:49:04.227 --> 00:49:07.540
Never let them see me cry.

732
00:49:12.546 --> 00:49:14.066
God.

733
00:49:16.311 --> 00:49:20.017
- It's okay.
- No, it's <i>not</i> okay.

734
00:49:21.059 --> 00:49:23.664
I never should've come here.

735
00:49:28.863 --> 00:49:30.091
Laney--

736
00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:38.211
Laney, we were having fun today.

737
00:49:38.394 --> 00:49:42.091
<i>You... you were having fun.</i>

738
00:49:44.278 --> 00:49:48.600
Sometimes, wh- when you open up to people,

739
00:49:50.162 --> 00:49:53.709
you let the bad in with the good,
that's all.

740
00:50:02.246 --> 00:50:04.666
I want to go home.

741
00:50:06.477 --> 00:50:08.338
Okay.

742
00:50:41.763 --> 00:50:43.058
So the party was that bad?

743
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.262
Can we <i>please</i> talk
about something else?

744
00:50:45.387 --> 00:50:49.159
C'mon, you didn't have a little fun?
Not even an M&M's worth of fun?

745
00:50:49.284 --> 00:50:50.904
You go, girl.

746
00:50:52.488 --> 00:50:56.118
- Maybe one of those brown M&Ms.
- Awesome.

747
00:50:56.844 --> 00:51:00.959
- Jesse, is it me or is there something very--
- You rock.

748
00:51:01.042 --> 00:51:04.297
Since when do <i>you</i> rock?

749
00:51:05.139 --> 00:51:07.853
<i>Well, well, earthquakes,
straight up and, uh, listen up.</i>

750
00:51:07.953 --> 00:51:12.252
Ballots are out. Looks like Terminal Taylor's
got herself a little dark horse competition...

751
00:51:12.277 --> 00:51:15.031
in the form of the falafel fairy herself.

752
00:51:15.273 --> 00:51:20.405
To be honest, I think the question on every
Harrison student's mind has got to be--

753
00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.976
Who the hell would nominate <i>me</i>?

754
00:51:23.001 --> 00:51:26.281
- Laney, just heard. Congrats.
- Thanks.

755
00:51:26.306 --> 00:51:28.092
You totally deserve it.

756
00:51:31.698 --> 00:51:32.800
Me.

757
00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:38.265
- Uh-oh.
- Taylor?

758
00:51:38.307 --> 00:51:40.594
- 9-1-1.
- Oh, God, big deal.

759
00:51:40.677 --> 00:51:44.008
- She's our friend.
- And things change.

760
00:51:47.822 --> 00:51:50.175
<i>He...

761
00:51:50.217 --> 00:51:51.202
broke...

762
00:51:51.282 --> 00:51:52.982
up...

763
00:51:52.982 --> 00:51:55.082
with me!

764
00:51:55.123 --> 00:51:56.494
You're kidding.

765
00:51:56.536 --> 00:52:00.482
Oh, Brock Hudson! I mean,
what kind of a name is that anyway?

766
00:52:00.607 --> 00:52:05.197
And that dancing.
Oh, my God, that dancing.

767
00:52:06.264 --> 00:52:07.809
What happened?

768
00:52:07.809 --> 00:52:11.566
I don't know.
I don't know.

769
00:52:11.708 --> 00:52:13.569
Hey, Taylor, it's been fun.

770
00:52:13.611 --> 00:52:18.776
But did you honestly think I'd leave for
All-Star Road Rules still dating you?

771
00:52:19.018 --> 00:52:21.280
Oh, you did?

772
00:52:21.622 --> 00:52:22.633
That's sweet.

773
00:52:22.833 --> 00:52:26.546
- <i>You want to know what I think?</i>
- Why not?

774
00:52:27.087 --> 00:52:29.041
You're better off without him.

775
00:52:30.878 --> 00:52:33.474
You know, you guys are the best.

776
00:52:39.517 --> 00:52:43.821
- <i>All right, all right.</i>
- See you guys.

777
00:52:45.324 --> 00:52:47.320
Did I miss something?

778
00:52:49.203 --> 00:52:51.333
All right, let's see what you got!

779
00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:53.670
<i>Come on! Let's go, Zack!</i>

780
00:52:53.753 --> 00:52:54.674

What was up out there today, Zack?

789
00:53:22.942 --> 00:53:24.342
Didn't have it, man.

790
00:53:25.284 --> 00:53:29.059
Maybe. Or could it possibly
be a symptom of withdrawal?

791
00:53:29.459 --> 00:53:30.559
Excuse me?

792
00:53:31.401 --> 00:53:35.024
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but it has been
a little while since you've gotten any, right?

793
00:53:35.166 --> 00:53:38.296
And you know something like that can
really screw up a guy's concentration.

794
00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.002
Or maybe now you're thinking,
you know, now that Taylor's free--

795
00:53:41.183 --> 00:53:42.645
Whatever, Dean.

796
00:53:43.929 --> 00:53:46.375
I don't know. Maybe it's
the Boggster's ass you want to tap.

797
00:53:47.917 --> 00:53:49.421
It's not about that.

798
00:53:49.846 --> 00:53:52.049
Oh, hey, man, I'm not baggin'.

799
00:53:52.049 --> 00:53:53.719
I mean, if you're not going to partake,
do you mind if I do?

800
00:53:53.803 --> 00:53:55.783
'Cause I'm thinking she
might be a great little jam.

802
00:53:57.266 --> 00:54:00.328

804
00:54:02.373 --> 00:54:04.193
You know, for four years,
I've watched you fool people

805
00:54:04.194 --> 00:54:06.389
into thinking you're
some sort of god in this place.

806
00:54:07.173 --> 00:54:08.638
Well, guess what?

807
00:54:08.738 --> 00:54:11.538
This is one contest you're gonna lose.

808
00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.042
You're going down, asshole.

809
00:54:19.866 --> 00:54:21.586
<i>I want you to take yours,

810
00:54:21.769 --> 00:54:23.768
Hygiene squad, put yours over here.

811
00:54:24.068 --> 00:54:26.668
Gay students, why don't you
put yours on the senior patio.

812
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:30.098
Prisoner's Club, all right. Put it
around the other side of this building.

813
00:54:30.281 --> 00:54:32.585
- <i>Yeah, I'll have one.
- Have a latte, vote for Taylor.</i>

814
00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.188
<i>Sure. I'll have one.</i>

815
00:54:34.672 --> 00:54:36.491
Have a latte, vote for Taylor.

816
00:54:45.128 --> 00:54:47.057
No one's allowed down here.

817
00:54:58.365 --> 00:55:00.177
This is amazing.

818
00:55:16.509 --> 00:55:18.096
Is that your mom?

819
00:55:19.221 --> 00:55:20.224
Yeah.

820
00:55:21.308 --> 00:55:24.280
She was an artist too.
Photography.

821
00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:26.825
<i>She's beautiful.</i>

822
00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:31.866
Yeah, well, not everything's hereditary.

823
00:55:40.211 --> 00:55:41.789
How did she die?

824
00:55:43.733 --> 00:55:44.895
Cancer.

825
00:55:46.796 --> 00:55:48.257
Leukemia.

826
00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:54.392
You wanna know the weird part about it?

827
00:55:55.776 --> 00:55:58.323
I don't remember crying at all.

828
00:55:59.665 --> 00:56:01.703
I remember the funeral.

829
00:56:02.286 --> 00:56:05.174
And I remember afterwards
everyone went to my grandma's house,

830
00:56:05.174 --> 00:56:10.015
and I sat on this big green chair
with Simon in my lap.

831
00:56:11.157 --> 00:56:14.012
And I remember knowing...

832
00:56:14.095 --> 00:56:16.809
that things were never
going to be the same.

833
00:56:21.858 --> 00:56:23.919
Laney, you can't keep doing this.

834
00:56:26.498 --> 00:56:28.283
Doing what?

835
00:56:29.126 --> 00:56:31.046
Shutting everybody out.

836
00:56:31.788 --> 00:56:34.084
Sitting here with 19 locks on your door.

837
00:56:34.184 --> 00:56:36.130
So I shut people out.

838
00:56:37.755 --> 00:56:40.744
At least I make decisions,
which is more than I can say for you.

839
00:56:41.386 --> 00:56:43.639
- Look, I make decisions.
- Oh, yeah?

840
00:56:43.764 --> 00:56:45.501
Where are you going to college, Zack?

841
00:56:45.627 --> 00:56:49.691
I was by the counsellor's office yesterday.
I believe next to your name it said "Undecided".

842
00:56:49.874 --> 00:56:51.519
Look, there's stuff you don't understand.

843
00:56:51.702 --> 00:56:53.023
You don't live with my dad.

844
00:56:53.323 --> 00:56:54.823
Explain it to me.

845
00:56:58.001 --> 00:57:00.114
My dad went to Dartmouth.

846
00:57:00.498 --> 00:57:04.138
It was the best four years
of his life, so he says.

847
00:57:04.579 --> 00:57:07.001
So ever since I was born--

848
00:57:13.392 --> 00:57:16.223
There's a picture of me
in his office when I'm five.

849
00:57:16.664 --> 00:57:19.302
We're at the zoo or- or someplace.

850
00:57:19.485 --> 00:57:22.824
I'm sitting on his shoulders
wearing a Dartmouth sweatshirt.

851
00:57:24.176 --> 00:57:26.697
- So?
- So it's emblematic.

852
00:57:27.199 --> 00:57:29.684
I get it from him every day.

853
00:57:29.709 --> 00:57:32.029
"Pick a college, Zack.
Pick a future."

854
00:57:32.113 --> 00:57:36.236
But what he's really saying is,
"Pick <i>my</i> college. Choose <i>my</i> future."

855
00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.098
Are you listening to yourself?

856
00:57:39.198 --> 00:57:43.505
Do you realize how lucky you are?
You can go to Dartmouth. You can go to N.Y.U.

857
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:45.692
You can go to Borneo
and study squid fishing.

858
00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:49.464
The point is, you're 18, and that's
old enough to start making your own choices.

859
00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:53.620
O-Okay, okay.
Chill, Tony Robbins.

860
00:57:57.291 --> 00:57:59.003
What about you?

861
00:57:59.545 --> 00:58:02.091
Shouldn't you be looking in the mirror
when you say some of this stuff?

862
00:58:03.133 --> 00:58:05.322
Trust me. I'm working on it.

863
00:58:08.099 --> 00:58:10.562
So, are you always this smart?

864
00:58:10.862 --> 00:58:13.607
Well, I have my moments.

865
00:58:17.614 --> 00:58:20.026
Why did you really
come here, Zack?

866
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:23.631
I forget.

867
00:58:36.124 --> 00:58:39.055
You're not just trying to get my vote
for prom king, are you?

868
00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.021
Zack?

869
00:58:47.408 --> 00:58:51.414
- This whole prom thing, I--
- Uh, I-- I got to run.

870
00:58:51.539 --> 00:58:53.001
I kind of wanted to talk
to you about it.

871
00:58:53.285 --> 00:58:55.379
Yeah, but I-- I have this sprinkler
thing to do for my dad.

872
00:58:55.604 --> 00:58:56.643
Now?

873
00:58:56.943 --> 00:58:58.543
Can I call you later?

874
00:58:59.785 --> 00:59:02.090
- Sure.
- All right, great.

875
00:59:07.106 --> 00:59:09.233
She made it bad.
What's she bitchin' about?

876
00:59:09.275 --> 00:59:11.564
<i>Weh, weh, weh. Huh?
What's her problem?</i>

877
00:59:11.689 --> 00:59:16.478
She doesn't like her million dollar makeover
or her overnight popularity? What is it?

878
00:59:16.578 --> 00:59:18.973
No, that's not the point, man.
I cared about her.

879
00:59:19.014 --> 00:59:23.213
I've got to hand it to you, Taylor.
Zack did <i>exactly</i> what you said he would.

880
00:59:23.396 --> 00:59:26.345
Of course he did.
I created him.

881
00:59:26.945 --> 00:59:27.945
Pay up.

882
00:59:28.529 --> 00:59:30.248
Oh, right.

883
00:59:30.532 --> 00:59:35.139
- Laney, Laney! W-Wait, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Relax, man. All right?

884
00:59:35.264 --> 00:59:37.835
Besides, he did have
his entertaining moments.

885
00:59:40.096 --> 00:59:43.767
"Your eyes are really beautiful."

886
00:59:43.809 --> 00:59:46.716
Hey, you know. Not to get,
like, all mellow on ya,

887
00:59:47.099 --> 00:59:49.936
but your eyes really <i>are</i> beautiful.

888
01:00:00.852 --> 01:00:03.006
- Hey, guys. Vote for Taylor.
- <i>No way!</i>

889
01:00:03.031 --> 01:00:05.709
<i>Okay. Don't vote for Taylor.

So what shouldn't I eat?

908
01:00:57.729 --> 01:00:59.306
Eat whatever you want.

909
01:01:01.218 --> 01:01:05.791
Okay. For your information,
I was about to eat a Snack Time chip.

910
01:01:05.974 --> 01:01:08.439
Snack Time owns Captain Peg-Leg Tuna

911
01:01:08.446 --> 01:01:11.850
which isn't-- all together now--
dolphin friendly.

912
01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:14.797
- Screw the dolphins.
- A guy tried that last year.

913
01:01:14.801 --> 01:01:17.200
He's banned from Sea World for life.

914
01:01:20.663 --> 01:01:22.341
What's wrong with you?

915
01:01:23.651 --> 01:01:25.112
Jesse, am I kissable?

916
01:01:25.154 --> 01:01:27.632
Okay, about these chips.

917
01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:33.908
I don't know, Laney.
You're... you.

918
01:01:35.311 --> 01:01:39.200
But maybe if I didn't know
you my whole life,

919
01:01:39.284 --> 01:01:42.337
- <i>and I just met--</i>
- Fresh ground pepper?

920
01:01:50.517 --> 01:01:53.454
- <i>Fresh ground pepper?</i>
- He must be crazy.

921
01:01:53.896 --> 01:01:55.399
Who, Simon?

922
01:01:56.024 --> 01:01:57.252
Zack.

923
01:01:57.477 --> 01:01:59.355
<i>Fresh ground pepper, anyone?</i>

924
01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:03.078
Fresh ground pepper?

925
01:02:04.713 --> 01:02:07.333
What? Too cold?

926
01:02:10.991 --> 01:02:12.394
Whoa!

927
01:02:12.994 --> 01:02:15.898
If it isn't the little
Rain-- Rain-- Rain Man himself.

928
01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:17.901
What's up, Semen? Huh?

929
01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:20.322
State your purpose or die.

930
01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:22.525
- I've got work to do.
- Sure you do.

931
01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:24.662
But I want to show you
something first.

932
01:02:25.446 --> 01:02:27.116
You're going to love this one.

933
01:02:29.168 --> 01:02:33.122
Checking this out.
Calm down. It's all right.

934
01:02:33.482 --> 01:02:35.028
Come on. You don't like that?

935
01:02:35.653 --> 01:02:38.641
<i>Ooh. Ooh!
Look, look, look, look, look!</i>

936
01:02:38.724 --> 01:02:42.354
<i>Ooh, look at her.
Ooh. What about that one?</i>

937
01:02:42.696 --> 01:02:44.442
Isn't that your mommy?

938
01:02:45.267 --> 01:02:47.570
- My mom's dead.
- Let him go.

939
01:02:50.324 --> 01:02:52.911
Let me tell you guys
what you're going to do.

940
01:02:52.953 --> 01:02:54.858
You're going to get up...

941
01:02:56.183 --> 01:02:58.061
and get over there...

942
01:03:01.984 --> 01:03:03.688
take your magazine...

943
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:09.394
and apologize to
my friend Simon here.

944
01:03:12.358 --> 01:03:13.853
Sorry.

945
01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.906
Sorry.

946
01:03:17.031 --> 01:03:19.827
You, pube boy...

947
01:03:21.312 --> 01:03:22.873
grab the pizza.

948
01:03:30.509 --> 01:03:31.795
Well?

949
01:03:33.222 --> 01:03:34.502
What?

950
01:03:36.244 --> 01:03:39.398
What do you think?
Hoover it.

951
01:03:48.862 --> 01:03:50.156
Now!

952
01:03:53.168 --> 01:03:55.171
<i>Dove right in.</i>

953
01:03:56.471 --> 01:03:57.933
<i>Yuck!</i>

954
01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:00.447
<i>He's chewing it and everything.</i>

955
01:04:00.788 --> 01:04:04.494
That's it.
Chew, chew, chew.

956
01:04:08.325 --> 01:04:11.362
Hold on.
Don't finish that.

957
01:04:12.965 --> 01:04:14.760
Munge here wants a piece
of the action, too.

958
01:04:14.843 --> 01:04:17.113
No way, man.
Those are his pubes.

959
01:04:17.138 --> 01:04:19.317
Well, I guess you should've
thought about that

960
01:04:19.317 --> 01:04:21.721
before you picked on
my friend Simon, huh?

961
01:04:27.529 --> 01:04:28.990
Thanks.

962
01:04:31.894 --> 01:04:33.130
Hoover it.

963
01:04:41.115 --> 01:04:42.744
Think this is bad?

964
01:04:43.669 --> 01:04:45.506
Try messing with him again.

965
01:04:47.542 --> 01:04:49.245
Everything copasetic?

966
01:04:49.429 --> 01:04:51.758
Yeah. I'll take it from here.

967
01:04:54.736 --> 01:04:58.283
Anybody want to try messing with me again?
Either of you? Both of you?

968
01:04:58.408 --> 01:05:01.145
- <i>You hear what he said?
- You were listening.</i>

969
01:05:20.817 --> 01:05:22.305
<i>Hey, Laney!</i>

970
01:05:25.432 --> 01:05:28.095
Listen, uh, I stopped by.

971
01:05:28.537 --> 01:05:31.691
Well, look, I was-- I was
hoping maybe we could talk.

972
01:05:34.003 --> 01:05:36.440
I know I-I don't come off
as the nicest guy in the world,

973
01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:39.020
but I was hoping maybe you could
just forget about that for a second.

974
01:05:39.261 --> 01:05:41.748
Because, uh, I was thinking--

975
01:05:41.831 --> 01:05:43.735
well, actually I was hoping--

976
01:05:44.418 --> 01:05:45.938
that...

977
01:05:46.021 --> 01:05:47.541
maybe we can go out sometime.

978
01:05:50.027 --> 01:05:52.081
And not just "out" out.

979
01:05:52.406 --> 01:05:55.285
A specific out.
Like the prom, maybe?

980
01:05:55.311 --> 01:05:56.898
Yeah, right.

981
01:05:58.123 --> 01:05:59.335
So that's a no?

982
01:05:59.545 --> 01:06:01.235
That's a hell no.

983
01:06:03.306 --> 01:06:07.053
Well, that's fair. I mean,
why should you say yes, right?

984
01:06:08.063 --> 01:06:11.053
I just hope this isn't
about Zack, because--

985
01:06:12.979 --> 01:06:14.156
Why?

986
01:06:16.676 --> 01:06:20.431
Well... he doesn't care
about you like that.

987
01:06:22.017 --> 01:06:25.146
<i>He told everybody he still
has this thing for Taylor.</i>

988
01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.903
But I don't know.
I mean, maybe I got it all wrong.

989
01:06:29.945 --> 01:06:31.906
Has the guy asked you to the prom?

990
01:06:35.161 --> 01:06:38.158
Well, just-- just head's up, okay?

991
01:06:38.183 --> 01:06:40.970
I mean, there's no sense
in getting hurt for no reason.

992
01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:49.099
Oh, yeah, and, Laney?
Think about the prom some more.

993
01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.754
<i>'Cause, uh, we'd have
an okay time, I think.</i>

994
01:06:52.496 --> 01:06:54.099
<i>I'll see ya.</i>

995
01:07:12.417 --> 01:07:14.872
- Dad.
- You want to explain this to me?

996
01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:17.534
- Aw, could we talk about this--
- Have you got any idea...

997
01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:19.662
how much you are jeopardizing
your future?

998
01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:23.626
- Half of these acceptance deadlines have lapsed!
- It's not that easy, Dad.

999
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:26.505
I'm not like you. I just can't
pick a letter out of a stack.

1000
01:07:26.631 --> 01:07:30.536
Of course you can. That's what being
an adult is all about. Making choices.

1001
01:07:30.619 --> 01:07:32.330
- Really.
- Yeah.

1002
01:07:32.414 --> 01:07:34.033
What about your choices, Dad?

1003
01:07:34.117 --> 01:07:36.145
- This is not about me.
- Aw, come on.

1004
01:07:36.228 --> 01:07:38.256
Look, you're never home.
You're pissed off half the time!

1005
01:07:38.382 --> 01:07:39.667
That's enough!

1006
01:07:42.488 --> 01:07:46.485
Look, I'm sorry. But you can't
fix your mistakes through me.

1007
01:07:48.947 --> 01:07:51.302
Is that what you think I'm doing?

1008
01:07:52.002 --> 01:07:55.040
Well, I'm sorry, but that
was never my intention.

1009
01:07:57.176 --> 01:08:00.372
And blaming me isn't going
to change the fact...

1010
01:08:00.414 --> 01:08:02.626
that the future is going to happen,

1011
01:08:02.667 --> 01:08:05.421
whether you are ready for it or not.

1012
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:21.505
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Welcome to the homestretch, earthquakes.

1013
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:23.674
A special shout out to all my seniors.

1014
01:08:23.758 --> 01:08:27.454
Just two weeks left until the time-honored
combination of crepe paper...

1015
01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:30.034
cleavage... and crys-tal.

1016
01:08:30.117 --> 01:08:31.637
The prom. You know what
I'm talking' about.

1017
01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.616
And, speaking of the big night,
word has it the recent support

1018
01:08:34.641 --> 01:08:38.328
<i>of Simon's big sister has left
the prom queen race</i>

1019
01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:41.234
<i>tighter than those little dresses
Taylor's been wearing around campus.</i>

1020
01:08:42.098 --> 01:08:44.398
<i>So vote early, vote often.</i>

1021
01:08:44.498 --> 01:08:46.968
<i>Here's a little, uh,
campaign music for you.</i>

1022
01:08:53.469 --> 01:08:55.956
Aw, come on, hon.
In the name of sportsmanship.

1023
01:08:56.081 --> 01:08:58.877
Big smile. Great.

1024
01:09:00.392 --> 01:09:02.502
Oh, out of my way, fool.

1025
01:09:03.275 --> 01:09:04.745
I think I touched her boob!

1026
01:09:07.765 --> 01:09:09.805
Top of the stairs, please.

1027
01:09:09.869 --> 01:09:12.072
- Zack?
- What do you want, Taylor?

1028
01:09:12.097 --> 01:09:15.000
Well, I was trying on this little
Richard Tyler dress the other day,

1029
01:09:15.001 --> 01:09:17.964
and I remembered that we
haven't finalized our plans.

1030
01:09:18.006 --> 01:09:20.410
- What plans?
- For the prom, silly.

1031
01:09:20.535 --> 01:09:24.165
I mean, we said we'd always go together, right?
Even if we were just friends?

1032
01:09:24.265 --> 01:09:26.244
What happened to Lord of the Dance?

1033
01:09:26.369 --> 01:09:30.074
That is so over. I mean, God,
don't even get me started.

1034
01:09:31.927 --> 01:09:34.680
Actually, Taylor,
I had other plans in mind.

1035
01:09:34.722 --> 01:09:36.179
Oh?

1036
01:09:36.679 --> 01:09:39.179
You're not talking
about Laney Boggs, are you?

1037
01:09:40.104 --> 01:09:41.399
What if I am?

1038
01:09:41.641 --> 01:09:46.098
Well, if I'm not mistaken, Zack,
she's already taken.

1039
01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:50.714
- <i>So what do you think?
- Yeah, what do you think?</i>

1040
01:09:50.839 --> 01:09:55.253
- I think it would be cool.
- Well, this goes up here.

1041
01:09:55.378 --> 01:09:58.424
- <i>It definitely lights--</i>
- Dean? What the hell are you trying to pull?

1042
01:09:58.966 --> 01:10:00.509
Well, it's nice to see you, too, brother.

1043
01:10:00.689 --> 01:10:02.039
Did he ask you to the prom?

1044
01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:04.433
- Yes, I did.
- I--

1045
01:10:04.558 --> 01:10:05.546
It's bullshit!

1046
01:10:05.586 --> 01:10:07.939
Wait, wait.
Someone asking me is bullshit?

1047
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.046
I thought we were going together.

1048
01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:15.033
All right, Zack, enough's enough.
This isn't cool anymore. I like this girl

1049
01:10:15.217 --> 01:10:17.512
<i>and you got to stop
this whole bet thing.</i>

1050
01:10:22.377 --> 01:10:25.565
- Bet?
- Yeah. It was so stupid, Laney.

1051
01:10:25.691 --> 01:10:28.697
Look, Zack said he can make any girl
prom queen, and you were the one picked.

1052
01:10:28.728 --> 01:10:31.834
So he thinks that if he takes you
to the prom, it'll help you win.

1053
01:10:35.038 --> 01:10:36.941
People have feelings, man.

1054
01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.962
Is that true?

1055
01:10:48.041 --> 01:10:53.056
Am I a bet? Am I a bet?
Am I a fucking bet!?

1056
01:10:57.697 --> 01:10:59.175
Yes.

1057
01:11:03.773 --> 01:11:07.036
You didn't think you became
popular for <i>real</i>, did you?

1058
01:11:08.463 --> 01:11:09.726
Oh, you did.

1059
01:11:09.926 --> 01:11:11.626
That's so sweet.

1060

Sounds good.

1080
01:12:42.479 --> 01:12:45.025
Did you know that some people
think being a pool man

1081
01:12:45.066 --> 01:12:47.846
is not a very respectable way
to earn a living?

1082
01:12:48.029 --> 01:12:49.434
People suck, Dad.

1083
01:12:49.634 --> 01:12:51.934
I don't get it, personally.

1084
01:12:51.976 --> 01:12:54.688
I own my own company
and my own home...

1085
01:12:54.772 --> 01:12:56.092
put the food on the table.

1086
01:12:57.059 --> 01:12:59.696
Granted, you and Simon help out.

1087
01:13:00.448 --> 01:13:01.977
We're a team.

1088
01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:08.485
Right. Maybe this "team" thing
is helping to create confusion

1089
01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:11.423
as to who the real parent is
around here.

1090
01:13:11.564 --> 01:13:13.052
What do you mean, Dad?

1091
01:13:14.135 --> 01:13:18.850
Well, you know I appreciate
everything you do, pumpkin-nose.

1092
01:13:18.933 --> 01:13:23.857
It's just that sometimes
I think you take on so much

1093
01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:27.956
so you don't have to deal with
the business of being a kid.

1094
01:13:30.493 --> 01:13:35.041
I can't imagine being 17 is easy...

1095
01:13:35.267 --> 01:13:37.989
especially with your mom not around.

1096
01:13:39.173 --> 01:13:44.555
I'm just afraid that if you keep
putting off your life like this...

1097
01:13:46.099 --> 01:13:49.175
you're gonna wake up
85 years old

1098
01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:53.944
sitting' on a porch somewhere...
lookin' for your teeth.

1099
01:13:54.654 --> 01:13:56.810
Thanks, Dad.
That was, um...

1100
01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.010
graphic.

1101
01:14:01.932 --> 01:14:04.853
Don't you have a-- a prom
or something to go to tonight?

1102
01:14:04.978 --> 01:14:08.466
- Ah, I'm not going.
- Oh, you're not. No.

1103
01:14:08.591 --> 01:14:11.830
- What, do you got laundry to do?
- Worse. I don't have a date.

1104
01:14:12.072 --> 01:14:15.827
No date?
See, now, that's weird, because...

1105
01:14:16.053 --> 01:14:19.691
I'm pretty sure there's a handsome
young man actually upstairs

1106
01:14:19.733 --> 01:14:22.546

waiting for you <i>now</i>.

1107
01:14:27.912 --> 01:14:30.335
Have fun, Laney.
And...

1108
01:14:32.018 --> 01:14:35.632
For you, not for someone else.

1109
01:14:50.546 --> 01:14:52.007
Hi, Laney.

1110
01:14:56.705 --> 01:14:58.337
Look, um...

1111
01:14:59.337 --> 01:15:01.337
You don't trust me...

1112
01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:03.549

<i>But just look at it this way...</i>

1114
01:15:06.088 --> 01:15:07.572
I didn't ask anyone else

1115
01:15:07.607 --> 01:15:10.726
on the chance that I'd come here tonight
and you'd say yes.

1116
01:15:11.603 --> 01:15:14.190
I mean, that's got to count
for something, right?

1117

You don't even have to change
if you don't want to.

1179
01:19:42.567 --> 01:19:43.614
Good song.

1180
01:19:44.314 --> 01:19:46.014
It's my favorite.

1181
01:19:48.184 --> 01:19:51.148
I'm Jesse Jackson.
I'm not a good dancer.

1182
01:19:51.689 --> 01:19:55.146
I'm Mack.
I go to school with 500 chicks.

1183
01:19:56.454 --> 01:19:58.241
Look, I'll be back in one minute.

1184
01:20:11.569 --> 01:20:16.043
Laney! I wanted you to know.
Your final project...

1185
01:20:16.326 --> 01:20:18.073
that picture of your mother...

1186
01:20:18.473 --> 01:20:19.973
extremely moving.

1187
01:20:20.098 --> 01:20:24.172
May be the best piece that I have
seen all year from anyone.

1188
01:20:24.655 --> 01:20:28.786
At least that's what I told all of your
art schools when I faxed them last Monday.

1189
01:20:28.811 --> 01:20:29.592
You're kidding.

1190
01:20:29.592 --> 01:20:32.792
I have spent four years trying
to open you up, Laney Boggs.

1191
01:20:32.959 --> 01:20:36.965
Whatever's responsible for
this change, don't let it go.

1192
01:20:57.054 --> 01:20:59.082
All right, boys.
Check it out.

1193
01:20:59.124 --> 01:21:03.697
Room number 4-0-9 is about to become
a historical landmark.

1194
01:21:04.023 --> 01:21:06.185
Why, are you getting
murdered there later?

1195
01:21:06.568 --> 01:21:08.721
No, man. I'm this close
to closing the deal.

1196
01:21:08.863 --> 01:21:10.991
She's eating up every word I say.

1197
01:21:11.075 --> 01:21:13.078
I don't know, Dean.
I feel a bet coming on,

1198
01:21:13.079 --> 01:21:15.690
but... I'm going to have to resist.

1199
01:21:15.832 --> 01:21:18.294
Laney Boggs is not
going to give you any.

1200
01:21:22.409 --> 01:21:28.351
- Hey, man. Tonight is the night.
- Hmm. Yeah, right.

1201
01:21:28.392 --> 01:21:30.829
I shelled out 300 bucks
for this room!

1202
01:21:33.717 --> 01:21:35.971
Tonight is definitely my night.

1203
01:22:02.508 --> 01:22:03.562
What?

1204
01:22:04.766 --> 01:22:06.066
Yeah, what?

1205
01:22:22.417 --> 01:22:23.517
People?

1206
01:22:23.658 --> 01:22:26.688
Attention, Harrison students.
People.

1207
01:22:26.772 --> 01:22:29.025
We're going to start, people.

1208
01:22:29.267 --> 01:22:31.225
I'll begin the presentation with, uh,

1209
01:22:31.225 --> 01:22:35.225
the announcement of your 1999 prom king.

1210
01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.893
<i>Well, it's no surprise here.</i>

1211
01:22:39.393 --> 01:22:40.793
<i>Zack Siler!</i>

1212
01:22:59.587 --> 01:23:03.476
And now for your 1999 prom queen.

1213
01:23:04.328 --> 01:23:07.440
<i>In the closest vote
in the school's history...</i>

1214
01:23:08.443 --> 01:23:11.564
<i>54% to 46%.</i>

1215
01:23:12.148 --> 01:23:15.452
Your 1999 prom queen is...

1216
01:23:17.681 --> 01:23:19.510
<i>Taylor Vaughan!</i>

1217
01:23:25.635 --> 01:23:26.813
Zack!

1218
01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:42.078
It should have been you up there.

1219
01:23:43.161 --> 01:23:45.482
I think the right person won.

1220
01:23:50.755 --> 01:23:51.826
Zack!

1221
01:23:53.068 --> 01:23:54.913
You wanna get out of here?

1222
01:23:55.638 --> 01:23:56.992
Yeah.

1223
01:23:58.576 --> 01:24:03.730
- Excuse me, pardon me.
- <i>Zack, uh, would like to say a few words.</i>

1224
01:24:04.401 --> 01:24:06.321
<i>I voted for you, Laney.</i>

1225
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:13.072
<i>You know, for a lot of us,
this is as good as it gets.</i>

1226
01:24:13.456 --> 01:24:17.212
We aced the test,
made the big shot...

1227
01:24:18.982 --> 01:24:20.701
got a crown.

1228
01:24:23.914 --> 01:24:26.068
- But the truth is...
- Excuse me, excuse me.

1229
01:24:26.393 --> 01:24:28.479
- <i>we're just getting started.</i>
- Zack!

1230
01:24:28.721 --> 01:24:32.377
- We can be anything we want to be.
- <i>Zack!</i>

1231
01:24:32.903 --> 01:24:36.391
- And I don't know about the rest of you,
- <i>Zack, over here!</i>

1232
01:24:36.691 --> 01:24:38.453
but I'm hoping' I never forget that.

1233
01:24:38.653 --> 01:24:39.957
Zack!

1234
01:24:41.999 --> 01:24:44.312
- Zack!
- <i>Hello? Can you hear me?</i>

1235
01:24:44.362 --> 01:24:46.015
- I was--
- Tell him!

1236
01:24:46.198 --> 01:24:52.481
Okay. First of all, I'd just like to thank
all of you who voted for me, okay?

1237
01:24:53.022 --> 01:24:54.978
You did the right thing.

1238
01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:57.581
As for the rest of you...

1239
01:24:57.623 --> 01:24:59.584
Okay, what were you thinking?

1240
01:24:59.626 --> 01:25:03.197
Dean-- Th-The key--

1241
01:25:03.239 --> 01:25:04.642
- Say it.
- A ho-hotel--

1242
01:25:04.842 --> 01:25:07.313
- He's taking Laney somewhere.
- <i>Room 4-0-9!</i>

1243
01:25:07.555 --> 01:25:10.575
<i>This isn't funny anymore!
Who turned this thing off?</i>

1244
01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:21.125
Yeah, Beverly Hills Hotel?

1245
01:25:21.408 --> 01:25:24.630
Yeah, do you have a Dean Sampson
registered in room 4-0-9?

1246
01:25:26.349 --> 01:25:28.485
You <i>have</i> a room 4-0-9?

1247
01:25:30.823 --> 01:25:32.202
Shit.

1248
01:25:36.748 --> 01:25:38.210
Yeah, Sunset Marquee, please.

1249
01:25:41.522 --> 01:25:46.170
And that is the kidney-shaped pool.

1250
01:25:46.296 --> 01:25:47.773
- Hello?
- Mmm?

1251
01:25:47.999 --> 01:25:50.810
lf you're going to help me out this summer,
you're going to have to know this stuff, okay?

1252
01:25:50.935 --> 01:25:52.780
Wh-what shape is that?

1253
01:25:52.822 --> 01:25:54.483
- Kidney?
- Thank you.

1254
01:25:54.625 --> 01:25:58.050
<i>They come in a lot of different
shapes and sizes. Here's--</i>

1255
01:26:00.091 --> 01:26:02.345
Hey, pumpkin-nose, how did it go?

1256
01:26:03.605 --> 01:26:07.462
Fine. You were right.
I did have fun.

1257
01:26:08.503 --> 01:26:10.982
Well, hey, uh,
come here a second, will you?

1258
01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:18.143
I don't know, Dad. I'd really
just rather go upstairs and--

1259
01:26:25.296 --> 01:26:27.825
Okay, well, I got to
get up pretty early.

1260
01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:31.931
<i>We're</i> getting up early
to, uh, install a spa.

1261
01:26:32.056 --> 01:26:34.209
So, we'll head to bed now.

1262
01:26:34.293 --> 01:26:37.809
lf you two want to talk, maybe you
can go in the backyard, hmm?

1263
01:26:37.873 --> 01:26:40.001
- Sure, Dad.
- Good night.

1264
01:26:44.433 --> 01:26:49.741
Listen, Zack. Uh, sorry about
that whole asshole thing.

1265
01:26:50.083 --> 01:26:52.087
It's cool.

1266
01:26:59.706 --> 01:27:01.125
Are you all right?

1267
01:27:05.106 --> 01:27:07.695
Jesse told me he heard Dean
talking about how he wanted to--

1268
01:27:07.817 --> 01:27:11.139
I just figured it out
a little late is all.

1269
01:27:20.487 --> 01:27:23.417
You know, sexual harassment
is still a big issue these days.

1270
01:27:23.701 --> 01:27:25.920
It's on my walls downstairs.

1271
01:27:28.724 --> 01:27:30.861
That's why...

1272
01:27:31.228 --> 01:27:33.415
why I carry this.

1273
01:27:33.857 --> 01:27:37.195
You push a little button,
and it makes a noise like a foghorn.

1274
01:27:37.279 --> 01:27:40.092
You can hear it
about half a mile away.

1275
01:27:40.575 --> 01:27:42.896
I put it up to his ear.

1276
01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:47.904
I just hope it doesn't
cause any permanent damage.

1277
01:27:58.293 --> 01:28:00.463
So how long have you
been here anyway?

1278
01:28:00.905 --> 01:28:02.466
A while.

1279
01:28:04.319 --> 01:28:05.932
You missed your prom?

1280
01:28:06.182 --> 01:28:07.932
Yeah.

1281
01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:15.444
You know, I made that bet
before I knew you, Laney.

1282
01:28:16.196 --> 01:28:18.515
Before I really knew <i>me.</i>

1283
01:28:20.853 --> 01:28:25.041
What was it for anyway?
I mean, what did you end up losing?

1284
01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:28.590
My best friend.

1285
01:28:32.028 --> 01:28:34.005
She taught me a lot.

1286
01:28:34.431 --> 01:28:36.893
Before her...

1287
01:28:36.976 --> 01:28:39.939
I thought we had to have
all the answers right now.

1288
01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:42.444
And now?

1289
01:28:43.486 --> 01:28:47.008
I'm kind of liking the fact
that I don't.

1290
01:28:50.347 --> 01:28:51.710
So...

1291
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:54.010
Can I have the last dance?

1292
01:28:57.424 --> 01:28:58.902
No.

1293
01:29:03.283 --> 01:29:05.286
You can have the first.

1294
01:29:38.494 --> 01:29:42.459
I feel just like Julia Roberts
in <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

1295
01:29:42.642 --> 01:29:45.245
You know, except for
the whole hooker thing.

1296
01:29:49.419 --> 01:29:51.863
So... what now?

1297
01:29:53.341 --> 01:29:56.821
I don't know.
Art school. You?

1298
01:29:57.263 --> 01:29:59.808
I've been kind of thinking
about art school myself.

1299
01:30:00.869 --> 01:30:02.148
- Art?
- Yeah.

1300
01:30:02.548 --> 01:30:04.148
You don't take art.

1301
01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:07.554
Yeah, but I'm thinkin' more
along the lines of <i>performance</i> art.

1302
01:30:07.838 --> 01:30:10.992
- Be silent, be still. Be silent--
- Zack.

1303
01:30:11.117 --> 01:30:12.431
What?

1304
01:30:12.831 --> 01:30:14.531
Shut up.

1305
01:30:31.006 --> 01:30:33.585
- <i>Zack?
- What?</i>

1306
01:30:33.626 --> 01:30:36.088
- <i>About the bet...
- Yeah.</i>

1307
01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:39.594
- <i>What were the terms, anyway?
- You'll see.</i>

1308
01:30:39.635 --> 01:30:41.496
<i>I never back out on a bet.</i>

1309
01:30:41.638 --> 01:30:43.751
<i>Darius Payne Oakes.</i>

1310
01:30:44.434 --> 01:30:46.755
