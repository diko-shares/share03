1
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:37,541
THE DISCREET CHARM
OF THE BOURGEOISIE

2
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,249
- Should I wait, your Excellency?
- Yes.

3
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:05,666
Good evening.

4
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,166
The fire isn't lit.

5
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,374
And the table isn't set.

6
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:18,541
Yet it's past eight o'clock.

7
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:22,999
Good evening, dear Alice.

8
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:25,083
Don Raphael!
How are you?

9
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,458
I'm fine.

10
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,708
Delighted to see you again.

11
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,499
Good evening.

12
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,416
What a surprise...

13
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,333
to see you tonight!

14
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,749
- You didn't expect us?
- Not tonight.

15
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:40,958
Not tonight?

16
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,624
I was expecting you tomorrow.

17
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,791
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

18
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,833
But Henri made it for tonight.

19
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,458
I'm positive.

20
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,458
That's impossible.

21
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,291
Henri is out
attending a business dinner.

22
00:03:58,459 --> 00:03:59,541
That's surprising.

23
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,958
I was there when he invited us.

24
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,333
Anyway, tomorrow I'm busy.

25
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:08,249
I couldn't have accepted.

26
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:10,583
I'm dining at the Colombian Embassy.

27
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,166
I really don't know what to say.

28
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,833
I'd ask you to share my dinner,

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,291
only I have nothing ready.

30
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:21,833
I really am sorry.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,249
Don't be sorry.
It doesn't matter.

32
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:26,416
A slight misunderstanding.

33
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:28,208
Won't you sit down

34
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,749
and have a drink?
- Yes. No?

35
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:35,041
Don't trouble yourself.
We're off.

36
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,499
By the way, I know a very nice inn
a few miles away.

37
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:41,249
I ate there once or twice.

38
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:43,791
- Come as my guest.
- Good idea.

39
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,666
Won't you come along?

40
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:47,999
You're sweet, but I'm not dressed.

41
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:51,583
Don't worry.
It's a very informal place.

42
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,791
I'll still go and change.

43
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,416
No, come as you are.

44
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:40,916
Not very cheerful.

45
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:42,708
Put that on, Alice.

46
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,874
Maybe it's closed.

47
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:48,041
I'll find out.

48
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,749
Doesn't look too good.

49
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,583
Shall I throw it away?

50
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:02,124
What's up?

51
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,666
- Is the restaurant closed?
- No, Sir.

52
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:05,791
May we come in?

53
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,583
Of course. One moment.

54
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,333
What does this mean?

55
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,083
Call the proprietor, Mr Manuel.

56
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,916
There's new management.

57
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,833
Then good night, Madam.

58
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,208
No, do come in.

59
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,583
Let's go in.

60
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,333
It's not crowded.

61
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:36,999
- A bad sign.
- Maybe it's too early.

62
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,624
Shall we sit here?

63
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:45,666
You go there.

64
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:53,458
Let's start with the wine.

65
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,333
It depends on what we order.

66
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,374
What do you like?
Claret? Burgundy?

67
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,291
Burgundy.

68
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:03,583
Even if I eat oysters or fish,

69
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,083
I prefer red wine.

70
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,458
Well?

71
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:13,916
Snails Chablis style.

72
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:15,791
I don't like snails.

73
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,958
I fancy hare pâté,

74
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:23,291
but in restaurants,
it's always too salty.

75
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:26,583
There's melon.

76
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,833
Good idea.
I'll have melon with port.

77
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:35,958
I'd have caviar,
but it might be of poor quality

78
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,458
and in small helpings.
I like mine better.

79
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,374
What fish is there?

80
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,291
I'm fond of fish.

81
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:46,458
Grilled sardines, filet of sole,

82
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,083
fried whiting, brown buttered skate,

83
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,541
quenelles of pike Nantua style,
boiled trout...

84
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,624
It's not expensive here.

85
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,583
Cheap, and no customers,
that's weird.

86
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,083
Think so?

87
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:03,083
Then I'll forget about the melon
and have a dry martini.

88
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,708
Out of the question.
Red wine, that's all...

89
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,999
if that.

90
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,124
And a good Crémant to please Picard.

91
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,124
- What's all this?
- Where are you off to?

92
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,499
Stay here.

93
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,833
You shouldn't pry.

94
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:30,499
So, we'll have...

95
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:34,333
one melon with port,
one melon...

96
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,499
One rollmops...

97
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,666
What's this?

98
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,958
It's the proprietor.
He died suddenly this afternoon.

99
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,666
We all loved him.

100
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,958
- He died in that suit?
- Why do you keep him there?

101
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,124
We're expecting the undertaker.

102
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,374
Of course,
we remain at your service.

103
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,833
No, I'm off.
I don't want to eat here.

104
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,208
But why?

105
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,583
Raphael, are you crazy?

106
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,583
I don't mind.

107
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,916
I can assure you that
you'll have an excellent dinner.

108
00:09:15,084 --> 00:09:18,208
- I'm leaving.
- As you like.

109
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,874
- And where do we go?
- Somewhere else.

110
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:24,583
If you don't mind, I'll go home.
Can you give me a lift?

111
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,958
With pleasure.

112
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:45,791
Republic of Miranda
Embassy

113
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:02,208
Yes?

114
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,458
Mr Sénéchal and Mr Thévenot are here.

115
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,458
Show them in.

116
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:17,166
Hello, Henri. François.
After you.

117
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,874
What was the idea last night?

118
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,833
- Coming to my house?
- You asked us.

119
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,583
Your mistake!
It was for today!

120
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,749
I couldn't have accepted!
Today, I have an engagement.

121
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,583
I don't get it...

122
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,624
Are you free for lunch Saturday?

123
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,999
Saturday? One moment...

124
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:45,291
It's OK with François.
One o'clock would be perfect.

125
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:48,166
Saturday's fine.
I've nothing planned.

126
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:50,291
We'll expect you, then.

127
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:55,083
Say...
There's a pretty girl over there.

128
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,249
Well, well...

129
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:29,583
What are you doing?

130
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,958
Put that gun down!

131
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,624
I know what I'm doing.

132
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,374
Who is she?

133
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:51,666
A girl from Miranda.

134
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,208
From Miranda?

135
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:57,333
Yes.
She belongs to a group of terrorists.

136
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,083
They've been after me.

137
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,041
- What for?
- What for?!

138
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:04,583
To shut me up or to murder me.

139
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,666
Who knows with terrorists?

140
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,791
Did you notify the police?

141
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,333
Right now, I'd rather not.

142
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,333
No doubt you understand why.

143
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,583
I had some trouble at the airport.

144
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:21,833
They wanted to search
my diplomatic bag.

145
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,374
I had to call the Minister.

146
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:26,666
Search the...
That's unthinkable!

147
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,333
Yes, well...

148
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,458
A month ago,
they arrested the Ambassador of...

149
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,499
An Ambassador
with 40 kilos of cocaine.

150
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,874
An Ambassador?

151
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,999
Which one?

152
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:44,041
The matter was hushed up.

153
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:46,166
There are 15 kilos.

154
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:52,124
The press didn't mention it.
It was the US Ambassador.

155
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:54,249
The US Ambassador?

156
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,458
It's the fourth Ambassador arrested.

157
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,083
We'll have to find some other means.

158
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,749
Want to test it?

159
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,333
The Harrison-Srauder?

160
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,541
It's the best.

161
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:07,374
I have a sample. Come...

162
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:10,791
Hold out your hand.

163
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,166
It's pure.

164
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:26,749
Excellent.

165
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,541
I brought the first payment.

166
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:35,374
You may check it.

167
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:37,749
I trust you.

168
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:41,541
The Marseilles gang suspects us.

169
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:44,124
They'd like to know
who our supplier is.

170
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:45,916
That's a nuisance.

171
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:48,416
No use worrying now.

172
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,958
Where do you intend
to invest that money?

173
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,291
Not in Miranda.

174
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,166
Same place as you.

175
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:58,999
What's the rate of the Deutschmark?

176
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,166
3.17 to the dollar.

177
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,541
- Should I wait here?
- Yes.

178
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:24,541
Wait, wait.

179
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:38,041
- Are your masters home?
- I'll tell them you're here.

180
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:47,666
Smells good.

181
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:50,541
I bet it's a vol-au-vent.

182
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:53,124
You said
the demographic explosion...

183
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:55,749
- What?
- That's it.

184
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:57,499
I'll explain...

185
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:01,416
- This is the earth.
- And here, the zodiac.

186
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,708
Come here.

187
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,833
Wait.

188
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:14,083
- What is it?
- The guests are here, Sir.

189
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,249
Tell them we'll be down.
Serve them drinks.

190
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:22,583
They can wait 5 minutes.
Come on...

191
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,291
Not here. We can't.

192
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:25,583
But why?

193
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,958
You scream too loud, you know it.

194
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:34,083
What are we to do?

195
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,666
Put on your dress.

196
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,458
They'll be down shortly.
Help yourselves to drinks.

197
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,916
Very well.

198
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:58,916
- What may I offer you?
- Anything you like.

199
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:02,166
- Same here.
- And you, Florence?

200
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,999
I'd like...

201
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:06,499
dry martini.

202
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,499
My sister had better not drink.

203
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:12,374
When we brought her home
last night...

204
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:13,874
She was dead-drunk.

205
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:18,166
She threw up everywhere...
The lift, the taxi... It was ghastly.

206
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:20,124
Her fingernails were filthy.

207
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:24,291
It isn't true. They weren't filthy.
You're the one...

208
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,333
Dry martinis for everybody?

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,583
There is no better tranquilliser.

210
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,708
I read it in a woman's paper.

211
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,166
Let me do it. I'll mix it.

212
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,333
These glasses aren't right.
Fashion changed.

213
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,708
For a dry martini,
the ideal is a cone-shaped glass.

214
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,083
Here it is!

215
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,291
That's about it.

216
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:56,749
The main thing is the ice.

217
00:17:56,917 --> 00:18:01,083
It's got to be first-rate.
Very cold, very hard.

218
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,708
15° or 16°C below.
Like this one.

219
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:42,583
What are you doing?

220
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,208
You pour the gin...

221
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:02,124
You shake it to cool it,
and serve.

222
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:05,291
Raphael knows that dry martini,
like champagne,

223
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:07,249
should be sipped.

224
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,541
Look...

225
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:12,499
Let's do an experiment.
Get your chauffeur.

226
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:13,791
My chauffeur?

227
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:17,166
- What do you want with him?
- You'll see.

228
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:23,499
Darling, like they did in New York
in the 30's,

229
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,666
you can add
a few drops of Pernod.

230
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,791
Maurice...

231
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,541
- Can you come a minute?
- Right away, Your Excellency.

232
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,291
This way.

233
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:54,208
We'd like you to have
a drink with us.

234
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,958
Thank you, Sir.

235
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,374
- Cheers, ladies and gents.
- Cheers, Maurice.

236
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:10,416
Very well, Maurice.
You may go. Thanks.

237
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,541
Good afternoon.

238
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,916
See that?

239
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,166
This is exactly

240
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,583
what shouldn't be done
with a dry martini.

241
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,374
Don't be nasty.
Maurice is a commoner.

242
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,416
He's had no education.

243
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:30,624
No system will ever enable the masses
to acquire refinement.

244
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:34,874
And yet, you know me.
I'm no reactionary.

245
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,958
But where are your masters?

246
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,291
I don't know. They've gone.

247
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:43,874
Gone? What do you mean?

248
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,666
I saw them run out to the garden.

249
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,166
How long ago?

250
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:50,666
Four or five minutes.

251
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,666
- Where were they off to?
- I don't know.

252
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:54,958
Excuse me, Madam.

253
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,208
What's the meaning of this?

254
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,958
I don't know.

255
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:03,583
Maybe we were denounced...
The police, a raid...

256
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,916
Think so?

257
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:07,999
Yes, otherwise,
why should they run away?

258
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:11,499
- They could've warned us!
- What if they had no time?

259
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,083
- Let's not stay here.
- You're right.

260
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,083
Come on, hurry!

261
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,583
Let's go!

262
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,166
It's cosy, here.

263
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,791
We must leave.

264
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,124
Where can we go?

265
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:33,583
Never mind, come on.

266
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,708
On your way.

267
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,083
Quick!

268
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,541
Sir?

269
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:22,374
Good day.

270
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:26,124
I'm Msgr Dufour,
bishop of your diocese.

271
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:28,833
Are Mr and Mrs Sénéchal home?

272
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,708
No, my Lord, they're out.

273
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,374
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

274
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:37,833
They had guests for lunch
then they all left.

275
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,458
- Will they be back?
- I suppose so, my Lord.

276
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,083
May I wait for them?

277
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,583
Certainly.

278
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:50,499
I'd like to sit down a minute,
if you don't mind.

279
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:54,749
- I'm a bit tired.
- Please do.

280
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:57,083
- You walked?
- Yes.

281
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,916
I had a car, but I sold it
for the benefit of the poor.

282
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:04,041
- Do you want a drink?
- Thank you.

283
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:05,166
I don't drink.

284
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:08,916
Tell me, my dear,
what's your name, please?

285
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:10,708
Ines.

286
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,041
Tell me, dear Ines:

287
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:15,791
is that the gardener's shed
I saw on the left?

288
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:18,249
Yes, my Lord.

289
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:20,833
But the gardener was fired last week.

290
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,166
Yes, I know that.

291
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:25,916
If you'll excuse me,
I have some work...

292
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:27,749
Go ahead, please.

293
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,791
What shall we tell them?

294
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:40,249
- Ines?
- Madam?

295
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,541
- Where are they?
- Who, Madam?

296
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:49,083
The guests!

297
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,541
- They've gone.
- Gone?!

298
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:54,041
What does that mean?

299
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:57,166
We were only gone for 20 minutes.

300
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:59,541
They had all sorts of drinks.

301
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:02,041
One doesn't leave like that!

302
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,583
You didn't stop them?

303
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,249
They looked scared
and left hurriedly.

304
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:08,499
Scared of what?

305
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:20,041
Hello.

306
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:22,499
Mr and Mrs Sénéchal?

307
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,791
I'm Bishop Dufour,
in charge of your diocese.

308
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,624
I wish to talk to you.

309
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,666
What's that?

310
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:32,583
His Lordship came by a moment ago.

311
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,208
- I asked him in and...
- Are you taking me for a fool?

312
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:37,916
Come on, clear off!

313
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:40,041
Go on, out!

314
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:44,791
What got into you?
You let anybody in?

315
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,749
He said he was a bishop.

316
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:48,458
And you believed him?

317
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:51,041
When we're out,
beware of strangers.

318
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:53,041
Is that clear?

319
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:54,583
Very well, Madam.

320
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,916
Come, let's tidy up a bit.

321
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,333
They looked scared.
That puzzles me.

322
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,374
Thévenot is always scared.

323
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:11,124
I'll call the Embassy.
Perhaps they can explain...

324
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:13,666
Wait a bit.
I'll bet they'll turn up.

325
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:17,374
You're right.
The day's ruined anyway.

326
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,291
Here they are.

327
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:37,416
Good afternoon.

328
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:41,708
You see?
Do you believe me, now?

329
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,374
I don't get it.

330
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,749
We are embarrassed.

331
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,041
- Never mind.
- Will you forgive us?

332
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:50,333
I gladly forgive you.

333
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,041
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

334
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,083
Excuse me.

335
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,374
Haven't we met before?

336
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,249
It's quite possible.

337
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:04,916
To what do we owe
the honour of your visit?

338
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:08,374
It's very simple:
I'd like to be your gardener.

339
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:09,624
I beg your pardon?

340
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:10,958
Your gardener.

341
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,999
To tend your garden,

342
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:16,333
the vegetables,
the flowers, the lawn.

343
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,374
You need a gardener, don't you?

344
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:22,458
- Yes, indeed.
- Well, I'm applying for the job.

345
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:25,791
- But really, my Lord...
- Don't be surprised,

346
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:28,874
the Church has changed a lot.

347
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:31,374
You've heard of the worker-priests?

348
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:34,374
It goes for bishops as well.

349
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:39,249
Are you skilled in gardening?

350
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:41,124
I should say!

351
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,833
As a child,
I lived in a large house...

352
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,458
rather similar to this one.

353
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:52,374
My parents - God rest their souls,
they both died a violent death -

354
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:54,166
had a very good gardener.

355
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:56,624
I learned everything from him.

356
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:58,708
They died a violent death?

357
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:01,291
Arsenic poisoning, both of them.

358
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,208
Who did it?

359
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,958
The culprit was never found.

360
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,999
How much would you earn?

361
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:10,499
Union rate, nothing more nor less.

362
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,874
Our last gardener was non-union.

363
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,291
Maybe.

364
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:17,958
But I live by the rules.

365
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,416
So, do you agree?

366
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:22,291
Well...

367
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:25,541
Alright.

368
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:27,749
- When can you start?
- Right now.

369
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:30,124
If you will show me your garden.

370
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,999
Let's go.

371
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:33,541
Excuse me...

372
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:36,708
a blade of grass in your hair.

373
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,791
Oh, yes. It's nothing.

374
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:40,791
Let's go.

375
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,708
See you later, Madam.

376
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,249
What will it be, ladies?

377
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:57,291
Three teas, please.

378
00:29:57,459 --> 00:29:59,249
- Milk or lemon?
- Lemon for me.

379
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:01,041
Same for me.

380
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:02,874
Milk, please.

381
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:04,541
Very good.

382
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:12,249
I can't stand the sight
of that musician.

383
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:15,249
- Which one?
- The cellist.

384
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:21,666
- Don't you like the cello?
- I hate it.

385
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,999
Will you change places with me?

386
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:25,666
Why not.

387
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:35,708
The cello is an instrument
of which I'm very fond.

388
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,916
The tone...

389
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:39,958
Most orchestras have dismissed them.

390
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,041
Look at that...

391
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,458
If only they were young...

392
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,416
- Did you notice?
- What?

393
00:30:58,584 --> 00:31:01,166
The soldier sitting over there.

394
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:05,249
He's a lieutenant.

395
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:08,333
- You know him?
- No, why?

396
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,291
He's been staring at us
since we came in.

397
00:31:11,459 --> 00:31:12,916
I don't know him.

398
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:14,458
Neither do I.

399
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,249
He looks so sad.

400
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:25,374
True.
But lieutenants often look that way.

401
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:26,999
I've always wondered why.

402
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:30,291
Terribly sorry, ladies.
We have no more tea.

403
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:32,749
What? No more tea?
What do you mean?

404
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:34,624
We had quite a crowd

405
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,708
and we've just run out.

406
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:39,416
- No tea at all?
- Not at all, Madam.

407
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:41,208
Something else?

408
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,083
I'll have coffee.

409
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,458
- Me too.
- Me too, with cognac.

410
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:47,791
We don't sell liquor.

411
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:51,416
- Then bring us 3 coffees.
- Very well.

412
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:01,666
Excuse me.

413
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:04,624
I'm Hubert de Rochecahin,
cavalry lieutenant.

414
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,583
May I sit at this table?

415
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,791
- But... certainly.
- Thank you.

416
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:14,374
Madam, did you have
a happy childhood?

417
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:16,833
Yes, very happy.

418
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,499
- And you, Madam?
- Me too...

419
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:23,541
- I have but happy memories.
- I haven't.

420
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:27,166
I've several complexes.
The Euclid complex...

421
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:29,416
My own childhood was tragic.

422
00:32:29,584 --> 00:32:31,458
Shall I tell you about it?

423
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:32,624
Here? Now?

424
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:35,541
It may be a bit long,
but it's interesting.

425
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:37,833
Well, if you like...

426
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,166
I remember, I was eleven...

427
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,083
I was about to enter military school.

428
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:48,166
Alright?
Not too tight under the arms?

429
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,291
Button up your tunic.

430
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:53,583
There you are, it's over.

431
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:56,333
Very nice.

432
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,624
Your father wants to see you.

433
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:00,624
Come on.

434
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:06,583
Your son, Sir.

435
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,333
Please, leave us.

436
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:10,666
Turn around.

437
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,624
Take a few steps.

438
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:21,333
Very well.

439
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,833
Now, listen to me.

440
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,374
Your mother's dead.
I'm responsible for your education.

441
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:31,083
At military school,
discipline is strict.

442
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,041
But it's for your own good.

443
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:37,374
I hope you'll do credit
to the name I gave you.

444
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,458
That's all I have to say to you.

445
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:15,833
Mother!

446
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,833
MOTHER, I...

447
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:42,124
Hubert, my son...

448
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:43,708
It's me.

449
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,874
Don't be afraid.

450
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,499
Come.

451
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,749
Don't be afraid.

452
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:51,666
Listen to me.

453
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,291
Come closer.

454
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,041
The man who lives here
and calls you his son

455
00:34:57,209 --> 00:34:58,791
is not your father.

456
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,583
You understand?

457
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,833
Look...

458
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,749
This is your real father.

459
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:05,999
The other one killed him

460
00:35:06,209 --> 00:35:09,374
in a duel, long ago.
We were very much in love.

461
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,749
Now, listen to me.
Don't be afraid.

462
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,291
Your so-called father

463
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,791
wakes up every night
and drinks a glass of milk.

464
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,708
In the bathroom cabinet,
you'll find a blue phial.

465
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:27,874
Take this phial tonight,
when he's asleep...

466
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,874
and empty it into his glass.

467
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:32,791
It's the last thing I ask of you.

468
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,999
Adieu, my son.

469
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:08,541
A few days later,
I was off to military school,

470
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:11,374
where an exciting life
was in store for me.

471
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:18,291
Sorry, ladies.
No more coffee.

472
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:21,041
- What's this?
- And no more milk.

473
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:23,624
- Are you kidding?
- Not at all.

474
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:26,833
But we've been
extraordinarily busy today.

475
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,124
There's no more coffee nor milk.

476
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:31,374
What can we drink?

477
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:34,166
- Do you have verbena?
- Sorry.

478
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:36,583
No more herb teas.

479
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,124
You have water?

480
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,333
Of course!
That I can promise.

481
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,874
So, bring some.

482
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:48,124
It is hard to believe.

483
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:50,916
Thank you for listening.

484
00:37:51,084 --> 00:37:53,124
With your permission, I'll leave.

485
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:54,999
Suit yourself.

486
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:56,499
And thank you.

487
00:37:57,084 --> 00:37:59,583
My God!
I just remembered!

488
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:03,916
I have an appointment.
I must go.

489
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:06,124
Excuse me.

490
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:09,583
- We'll meet again.
- Sure. See you soon.

491
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:38,833
Sorry I'm late, darling.

492
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,499
Not too much.

493
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:44,708
- Champagne?
- With pleasure.

494
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:45,958
No...

495
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:48,458
Afterwards.

496
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:00,999
No...

497
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:04,833
- Take off your clothes.
- Switch off the light.

498
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,166
- Why?
- It hasn't healed yet.

499
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:10,249
What?

500
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:11,833
Nothing on your hands.

501
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,249
On my hands, no, but elsewhere...

502
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:17,416
My God! If you saw it!

503
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:19,874
In that case...

504
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:26,916
This dress! What a nuisance!

505
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:36,874
Turn off the light!

506
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:47,249
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

507
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:51,124
Who can it be?

508
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,124
Wait.

509
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,208
Oh, it's you!

510
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:08,499
Very good.

511
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,916
Come. After you.

512
00:41:21,084 --> 00:41:22,541
What's up?

513
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:25,333
I saw Sénéchal, this morning.

514
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,583
He's sorry about
the missed luncheon.

515
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,624
A misunderstanding, it seems.

516
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:32,791
- He asked us to dinner tonight.
- Tonight?

517
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:34,291
Who is it?

518
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,499
Your husband.

519
00:41:37,084 --> 00:41:39,499
- My wife's in your room?
- Yes.

520
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:42,208
She's been there five minutes.

521
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,541
That's odd.

522
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:49,083
She didn't tell you?

523
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:51,916
You're here? What a coincidence!

524
00:41:52,084 --> 00:41:55,458
I also came to invite Raphael.

525
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:58,749
- Are you free tonight?
- Entirely free.

526
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:01,708
- Shall we go together, as usual?
- Gladly.

527
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:04,374
- A drop of champagne?
- No, I've got to leave.

528
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:06,624
Coming home with me?

529
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:08,833
No, wait...

530
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,958
Let her stay just two minutes.

531
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:15,458
- What for?
- I must show her the sursiks.

532
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,666
- The what?
- The sursiks.

533
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:19,624
Oh, yes...

534
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:21,624
I'll wait in the car.

535
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,541
I'll come right away.

536
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:32,083
- What are sursiks?
- I don't know. It doesn't matter...

537
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,208
Come!

538
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,083
You're out of your mind!

539
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,166
He might come up again!

540
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:39,083
Just a minute...

541
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,333
No.
Let go of me! Let me go!

542
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,833
See you tonight, darling.

543
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,041
Goodbye.

544
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,541
Stand still.

545
00:44:16,709 --> 00:44:18,291
Hands up.

546
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,208
Any weapons?

547
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:32,999
You're better suited for love
than for war games.

548
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,208
Come on, girl.

549
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,416
Come on!

550
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:48,708
You think I'm a bastard.

551
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:51,374
I'd even be a socialist...

552
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:53,083
if socialists believed in God.

553
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:55,666
How old are you?

554
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:06,083
You and your friends
don't stand a chance.

555
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,041
Violence leads nowhere.

556
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:10,166
I keep saying so.

557
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,708
You're a good little housewife.

558
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:14,874
You've bread, lettuce...

559
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:17,291
The key to your dreams...

560
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:23,791
Caramba!

561
00:45:26,084 --> 00:45:29,208
Forewarned is forearmed.
Don't you agree?

562
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:32,624
Champagne?

563
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,916
Do you have any brothers?

564
00:45:47,084 --> 00:45:49,958
In our heart of hearts,
we think alike.

565
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,833
The bomb and pollution,
for instance.

566
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,416
You're against them.
Well, so am I.

567
00:45:55,584 --> 00:45:58,208
You're in favour of free love?
So am I.

568
00:45:59,042 --> 00:46:00,624
You have no right to touch me...

569
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:01,958
Mao Tse Tung is right.

570
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:05,333
Bastards like you must be eliminated.

571
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,708
No, I don't agree.

572
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:11,499
If Mao said that,
it means he doesn't understand Freud.

573
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:14,333
In fact, if you think about it,

574
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,291
the only solution
to starvation and poverty

575
00:46:17,459 --> 00:46:19,958
is in the hands of the Army.

576
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,874
You'll realize it in Miranda,

577
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,791
when you have to open
your pretty thighs

578
00:46:24,959 --> 00:46:27,291
to an infantry battalion.

579
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:29,166
You disagree?

580
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,208
And now?

581
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,708
Surely, your gun must be loaded.

582
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:39,083
Since you came to kill me,

583
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:42,083
I could easily get rid of you.

584
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,083
Self-defence.

585
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,499
But I'll show you I can be generous.

586
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:51,041
The door is open. Get out.

587
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,583
Go!

588
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,833
I've a dinner party tonight.
I must get ready.

589
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,666
Go.

590
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,916
You don't know what W.I.M. means?

591
00:48:12,084 --> 00:48:13,624
To me, initials, you know...

592
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:16,541
Women's International Movement.

593
00:48:16,709 --> 00:48:19,541
You know the rallying sign
of the W.I.M.?

594
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:21,208
It's this.

595
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,041
An idiotic sign like all the others.

596
00:48:24,209 --> 00:48:27,749
Fascists, communists, victory...

597
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:31,624
and Christ is our Lord.
- And Morituri te salutant.

598
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:34,249
Raphael, can you come a minute?

599
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:40,124
May I introduce Don Raphael Acosta,

600
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,291
Ambassador of Miranda.

601
00:48:42,459 --> 00:48:44,666
Bishop Dufour.

602
00:48:44,834 --> 00:48:46,416
- Your Lordship.
- Your Excellency.

603
00:48:46,584 --> 00:48:48,541
We'll start dinner soon.

604
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:51,208
In the meantime,
will you have a drink?

605
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:53,749
I don't normally,
but I'll have a spot of whisky,

606
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:55,958
with soda.

607
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,583
- Raphael?
- Nothing, thank you.

608
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,916
I'm delighted to meet you.

609
00:49:01,084 --> 00:49:04,791
You know we have
an important mission in Bogota.

610
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:06,666
Bogota is in Colombia.

611
00:49:06,834 --> 00:49:09,666
That's right, it's in Colombia.

612
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:12,541
I got mixed up.
I don't know Miranda

613
00:49:12,709 --> 00:49:15,208
but I hear
it's a magnificent country.

614
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:18,041
The Andes cordillera, the pampas...

615
00:49:18,209 --> 00:49:21,291
The pampas are in Argentina.

616
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,416
You're right.
The pampas... of course.

617
00:49:24,584 --> 00:49:25,708
I should know.

618
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:29,083
Recently, I saw a book
on Latin America.

619
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,333
There were photos
of your ancient pyramids.

620
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,749
- Our pyramids?
- Yes.

621
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:37,208
We have no pyramids in Miranda.

622
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,666
Mexico and Guatemala have pyramids.

623
00:49:39,834 --> 00:49:41,833
- We don't.
- You're sure?

624
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,583
Absolutely sure.

625
00:49:45,042 --> 00:49:46,541
Dinner is served.

626
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:51,166
Please...

627
00:49:51,334 --> 00:49:53,666
We can go in to dinner now.

628
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:24,458
My Lord, please...

629
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:26,874
After you, Madam.

630
00:50:27,042 --> 00:50:28,666
Then, Raphael, you start first.

631
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:30,458
If you insist.

632
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:40,999
Who can it be at this time?

633
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:43,833
Rosalie, answer the door.

634
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:01,333
Ladies and Gentlemen, good evening.

635
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,166
We apologize.

636
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:06,708
I was expecting you tomorrow.

637
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,749
Manoeuvres start one day earlier.

638
00:51:09,917 --> 00:51:12,583
But Colonel,
you arrive unexpectedly...

639
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,749
I'm really sorry.
It isn't my fault, believe me.

640
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:18,208
Tonight we happen to have guests.

641
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,541
- Have you eaten?
- No.

642
00:51:20,709 --> 00:51:23,833
Give me five minutes.
I'll see what I can do.

643
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,249
In the meantime, have a drink,

644
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,374
and get acquainted with our friends.

645
00:51:28,542 --> 00:51:30,541
With pleasure.

646
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:34,083
My Lord, could you give us a hand?
We need chairs.

647
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,333
At your service.

648
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:45,249
What's in the fridge?

649
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,166
A pâté, some ham...

650
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:55,166
Whisky? Dry martini? Vodka?

651
00:51:55,334 --> 00:51:57,458
Anything you like.

652
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:59,666
A martini?

653
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:03,166
I'm really sorry.
Mr Sénéchal had agreed

654
00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:05,583
to let us stay during manoeuvres.

655
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,791
I never thought he'd have guests.

656
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,083
- Mexican?
- Congo.

657
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,374
- Very good.
- Infantry?

658
00:52:13,542 --> 00:52:16,291
- No, cavalry.
- I'm sorry.

659
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:18,541
What are you smoking, Colonel?

660
00:52:18,709 --> 00:52:21,541
- Marijuana. You want some?
- No, thank you.

661
00:52:21,709 --> 00:52:23,416
- Excellency?
- Certainly not.

662
00:52:23,584 --> 00:52:25,166
I'd love some.

663
00:52:40,084 --> 00:52:42,124
- Not those chairs!
- Oh.

664
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:44,999
I'll get some others.

665
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:48,416
My Lord...

666
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,124
It's alright...

667
00:52:54,584 --> 00:52:57,583
Unbelievable what they smoke
in the Army.

668
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:02,249
My country's army
is remarkably strict.

669
00:53:02,417 --> 00:53:04,916
Marijuana is nothing.

670
00:53:05,084 --> 00:53:07,666
It's the first step.

671
00:53:07,834 --> 00:53:10,749
- I loathe drug addicts.
- So do I.

672
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:14,583
Lately, 6000 US Marines
were discharged

673
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,583
for being drug addicts.

674
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,333
- My Lord...
- No, please...

675
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,083
I insist.

676
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,541
Very kind of you.

677
00:53:21,709 --> 00:53:24,541
Marijuana isn't a drug.

678
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:27,041
Look at what goes on in Vietnam.

679
00:53:27,209 --> 00:53:29,999
From the General down to the private,
they all smoke.

680
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:33,791
The result is, once a week,
they bomb their own troops.

681
00:53:34,042 --> 00:53:37,833
They must have their reasons.

682
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,208
Remember, during World War 1,

683
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:44,249
French troops had to drink
3 bottles of wine per day.

684
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:47,166
- You're exaggerating.
- I'm not.

685
00:53:47,334 --> 00:53:50,833
And in spite of that,
there still were runaways.

686
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,749
These were machine-gunned
by the gendarmes.

687
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:55,791
There were hundreds of dead.

688
00:53:55,959 --> 00:53:57,208
Never heard of it.

689
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:01,374
It's notorious. It's history.
They say it happened at Verdun.

690
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:03,333
We can start dinner now.

691
00:54:03,542 --> 00:54:06,999
If we sit close,
we can all squeeze in.

692
00:54:07,167 --> 00:54:10,208
Helpings will be limited.

693
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:13,374
But there are still some eggs,
ham and cheese.

694
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:16,833
I'm sure everything will be alright.
I'm very sorry.

695
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,041
Please, sit as best you can.

696
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:34,666
- A little foie gras, Colonel?
- Gladly.

697
00:54:34,834 --> 00:54:36,958
- May I help you?
- Please do.

698
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,499
Thanks.

699
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:40,583
The manoeuvres go on for...?

700
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:41,708
About a week.

701
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,999
Message from the GHQ
for the Colonel.

702
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,666
- Sir!
- What's that?

703
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:02,083
Please excuse me.

704
00:55:04,584 --> 00:55:06,541
- Now what!
- What's the matter?

705
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:09,958
The Green Army's attacked
ahead of time. We must go.

706
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:14,208
- But you didn't eat!
- Sorry, Madam, orders are orders.

707
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:16,958
Ladies, Gentlemen.

708
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:18,749
Gentlemen, we are off.

709
00:55:18,917 --> 00:55:20,499
- Sir!
- Yes.

710
00:55:22,792 --> 00:55:24,166
Ah, yes...

711
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:28,083
The Sergeant has
a very nice dream to relate.

712
00:55:31,334 --> 00:55:32,583
We're listening.

713
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:38,124
I had a dream, last week.

714
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,458
I was taking a stroll at dusk

715
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:43,666
along a very busy street.

716
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,166
You, around here?

717
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:08,124
And you?

718
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:09,958
I live here.

719
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,499
Since when?

720
00:56:13,334 --> 00:56:15,583
Six years, I believe.

721
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:19,249
- And you?
- I just arrived.

722
00:56:26,709 --> 00:56:29,583
What's the matter?
You're so pale!

723
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,416
And you!
If you could see yourself!

724
00:56:32,584 --> 00:56:35,916
- You smell of earth.
- So do you.

725
00:56:36,084 --> 00:56:39,791
- Going to stay here long?
- Forever.

726
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,999
Wait here a minute.

727
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:55,749
I have to buy something.

728
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:57,499
I'll wait.

729
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:03,708
Well, hello.

730
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:04,958
Hello.

731
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:07,916
Weren't you with Ramirez,
just now?

732
00:57:08,084 --> 00:57:09,083
Yes.

733
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:12,041
It was him?
Are you sure?

734
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:15,583
Ramirez has been dead
for more than six years.

735
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:19,458
Yes, of course!
You're right.

736
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:22,124
- How can that be?
- I don't know.

737
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:23,666
I came across him.

738
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:26,833
He told me he lives here.

739
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:30,583
But now, I remember.
He died long ago.

740
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:31,791
He went in there.

741
00:57:31,959 --> 00:57:34,374
I'll call him. Wait for me.

742
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:49,999
- Is it you?
- Yes, it's me.

743
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:51,333
You recognize me?

744
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,541
How could I fail to?

745
00:57:53,709 --> 00:57:56,583
- You didn't forget me?
- Forget you?!

746
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:04,374
Every time I tried to talk to you,

747
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:08,333
you kept aloof.
You spurned me.

748
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,166
- Remember?
- I remember.

749
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:14,041
The last time,
you returned to the ground.

750
00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:17,666
Now, I meet you here
and you come to me.

751
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:19,124
Why so late?

752
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:22,833
I don't know.
I wanted to see you again.

753
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,791
I looked for you in that crowd.

754
00:58:25,959 --> 00:58:28,249
Since I came here,
I've been looking for you.

755
00:58:28,959 --> 00:58:32,083
- We'll never part again.
- Never.

756
00:58:37,917 --> 00:58:41,416
Three minutes ago,
I bumped into an old friend.

757
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:44,166
I'll bring him to meet you.

758
00:58:44,334 --> 00:58:46,249
I'll wait for you.

759
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,916
Ramirez!

760
00:59:30,709 --> 00:59:32,666
Where are you, mother?

761
00:59:35,334 --> 00:59:37,749
I look for you among the shadows.

762
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:43,583
Mother?

763
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:53,291
I went, looking for my mother

764
00:59:53,959 --> 00:59:55,791
in the street full of shadows.

765
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,374
But no one answered.

766
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:04,916
Tell us about the train dream, too.

767
01:00:05,084 --> 01:00:05,958
Yes!

768
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:09,374
No. The train we'll keep
for some other time.

769
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:11,333
Let's go.

770
01:00:11,834 --> 01:00:13,333
My respects.

771
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,249
Ladies, Gentlemen.

772
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:03,958
When Lazarus rose from the dead,

773
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:06,291
he had no memories.

774
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:16,708
What's that?

775
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:18,624
The manoeuvres are starting.

776
01:01:18,792 --> 01:01:21,166
I hope they'll spare the house.

777
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:28,041
I'll prepare a hot drink.

778
01:01:35,709 --> 01:01:36,999
Good evening.

779
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:38,749
It's me again.

780
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:43,041
No, please, sit down.

781
01:01:43,209 --> 01:01:45,249
I hope the noise doesn't disturb you.

782
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:47,124
No, it's quite normal.

783
01:01:47,292 --> 01:01:49,124
It's an artillery preparation.

784
01:01:49,292 --> 01:01:51,666
The cavalry will attack
in 20 minutes.

785
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,291
I see.

786
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,249
Mrs Sénéchal isn't here?

787
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:58,583
So it was you, Colonel.

788
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,416
- Have a cup of coffee.
- Thanks, I don't have time.

789
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:04,291
I wanted to apologize again.

790
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:08,124
I'd be delighted
if you, and of course your friends,

791
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:11,458
agreed to come to my house
for dinner next Friday.

792
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:13,708
The manoeuvres will be over.

793
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:16,583
If my friends agree.

794
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:18,333
Splendid!

795
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,666
I hope his Lordship
will grace us with his presence.

796
01:02:20,834 --> 01:02:24,166
- I'll consider it an honour.
- Next Friday, then.

797
01:02:24,334 --> 01:02:27,249
My wife will be delighted
to meet you.

798
01:02:29,167 --> 01:02:29,999
We live

799
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:32,708
at 17, rue du Parc.

800
01:03:18,042 --> 01:03:20,541
The masters won't be long.

801
01:03:33,084 --> 01:03:37,208
"Hat worn by Napoleon
the day of the battle of Wagram."

802
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:38,999
I want to see that!

803
01:03:41,709 --> 01:03:43,583
Doesn't fit me. Too small.

804
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,999
But I feel it's made for you.

805
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:48,416
Henri! That's bad taste!

806
01:03:48,584 --> 01:03:50,666
What did I tell you?
It fits you to a T.

807
01:03:50,834 --> 01:03:53,083
What a child you are!

808
01:03:59,459 --> 01:04:02,041
- Would you like more?
- No, thank you.

809
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:04,416
- Add some soda!
- No, thanks.

810
01:04:04,584 --> 01:04:06,999
Cheers!

811
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,499
- Is it whisky?
- The bottle says so.

812
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:16,666
- Tastes like quasi-cola.
- It is quasi-cola.

813
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:20,916
If the meal is like the drink,
I'm not looking forward to it!

814
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:54,499
Is this a joke?

815
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,999
To prove your courage,
you invited to dinner

816
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:26,583
the Commander's ghost.

817
01:05:27,292 --> 01:05:29,916
And to prove your courage...

818
01:05:30,084 --> 01:05:33,749
you invited to dinner...

819
01:05:46,334 --> 01:05:48,833
And to make us believe
that he had come...

820
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:51,083
What am I doing here?

821
01:05:51,292 --> 01:05:53,833
You drugged us.

822
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:59,291
I don't know the lines.

823
01:06:20,542 --> 01:06:22,374
What's eating you?

824
01:06:22,542 --> 01:06:23,916
Nothing.

825
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:25,416
A preposterous dream.

826
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:29,624
At the Colonel's,
we found ourselves on a stage.

827
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:31,166
What?

828
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:37,999
Hello?

829
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:41,083
Good evening. What?

830
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:44,083
What are you doing?

831
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,124
We're at the Colonel's.

832
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:49,041
We feared something had happened.

833
01:06:49,584 --> 01:06:52,333
I overslept.

834
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,249
We are leaving.

835
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:03,416
How do I look, Raphael?

836
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:06,958
Dreadful.
The hat's a bit effeminate.

837
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,999
Excellency!

838
01:07:09,167 --> 01:07:10,708
You mean Napoleon was a...?

839
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:15,124
I've already seen 3 hats Napoleon
wore at the battle of Wagram.

840
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:16,791
I'm surprised.

841
01:07:16,959 --> 01:07:19,041
Another whisky?

842
01:07:19,209 --> 01:07:20,791
Excuse me.

843
01:07:24,084 --> 01:07:25,583
Some more port?

844
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,499
I still have some.

845
01:07:36,834 --> 01:07:39,249
Glad to see you.
We were getting worried.

846
01:07:39,417 --> 01:07:41,833
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

847
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,416
Good evening.

848
01:07:43,584 --> 01:07:45,791
Come and sit down.
Have a drink.

849
01:07:45,959 --> 01:07:47,833
I'll have a scotch.

850
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,583
- And you?
- A drop of port.

851
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,208
I hope you'll like it.
It's very old port.

852
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,958
Please...

853
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:11,166
Good evening.
Any news from Miranda?

854
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:13,874
- What's the situation?
- Quite calm.

855
01:08:14,042 --> 01:08:15,083
And the guerrillas?

856
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:18,708
There are a few left.
They're part of our folklore.

857
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:21,249
You have problems
with the students.

858
01:08:21,417 --> 01:08:24,583
Students are young.
They must have some fun.

859
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:29,958
How's your government treating them?

860
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:35,166
We are not against the students.

861
01:08:35,334 --> 01:08:38,958
But what can you do when your room
is swarming with flies?

862
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:41,791
You take a fly-swatter and bang!

863
01:08:41,959 --> 01:08:43,374
No more flies.

864
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:45,708
One moment.

865
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:49,916
I don't know your country
but I hear it's beautiful.

866
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,374
Indeed.

867
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:54,083
Of course, you have no caviar
and no champagne.

868
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:59,166
No, but we have things that are
just as good, if not better.

869
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:01,083
Excuse me.

870
01:09:08,792 --> 01:09:14,166
Is it true that in certain areas in
Miranda there's still dire poverty?

871
01:09:14,334 --> 01:09:19,166
I can hardly believe that the gap
between rich and poor is widening.

872
01:09:19,334 --> 01:09:20,999
You've been misled.

873
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:23,749
Our economy is expanding.

874
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:26,166
There are figures to prove it.

875
01:09:26,334 --> 01:09:28,458
Excuse me.

876
01:09:33,542 --> 01:09:35,291
Excuse me, your Excellency...

877
01:09:35,459 --> 01:09:37,541
I heard you talk about your country.

878
01:09:37,709 --> 01:09:40,791
I'm interested
in administrative problems.

879
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:42,874
What are you referring to?

880
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:46,999
For instance, I'm told
it's common in your country

881
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:49,541
to bribe a judge or a policeman.

882
01:09:50,834 --> 01:09:54,749
Maybe in the past, like everywhere.

883
01:09:54,917 --> 01:09:57,624
But today we are a true democracy.

884
01:09:57,792 --> 01:10:00,083
Corruption no longer exists.

885
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:01,874
Excuse me.

886
01:10:08,042 --> 01:10:10,666
I don't think I belong here.

887
01:10:11,584 --> 01:10:14,249
- What's up?
- Nothing.

888
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:16,124
I'll tell you.

889
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:17,874
See you tomorrow.

890
01:10:28,209 --> 01:10:30,083
Your Excellency!

891
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:35,791
- Leaving already?
- No, Madam. Why?

892
01:10:35,959 --> 01:10:39,083
My husband would like
to talk with you.

893
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,708
I'd like to drink to your health.

894
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:44,166
Gladly, Colonel.

895
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,249
Here...

896
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:52,916
- Your health.
- Cheers.

897
01:10:56,167 --> 01:10:59,583
Your country draws a lot of attention
these days,

898
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:00,791
especially here.

899
01:11:00,959 --> 01:11:03,916
I read that Miranda holds
the world record

900
01:11:04,084 --> 01:11:07,208
for the number of homicides
per capita.

901
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:09,916
You're mistaken, Colonel.

902
01:11:10,084 --> 01:11:13,416
Not at all. They say
people kill at the drop of a hat.

903
01:11:13,584 --> 01:11:15,541
There are at least
30 killed a day.

904
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,458
No, Colonel.

905
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,541
I think you're trying
to offend me.

906
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:23,541
Me? Not at all.
I'm telling you what I know.

907
01:11:23,709 --> 01:11:27,624
I read it recently
in a very reliable report.

908
01:11:27,792 --> 01:11:30,249
I refuse to take your word for it.

909
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:33,833
I know what I'm talking about.

910
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,916
If I weren't your guest,
I'd demand satisfaction.

911
01:11:38,834 --> 01:11:42,249
I didn't know that chivalry
still existed

912
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:45,208
in your semi-savage country.

913
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,166
Sir, you just insulted
the Republic of Miranda.

914
01:11:50,334 --> 01:11:54,083
I don't give a damn
about the Republic of Miranda.

915
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:59,249
And I shit on your entire army.

916
01:12:08,459 --> 01:12:10,666
What happened?
I didn't hear a thing.

917
01:12:10,834 --> 01:12:12,833
Calm down, Colonel.

918
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,374
He's a charming man.

919
01:12:14,584 --> 01:12:17,333
The ambassador is a cad.
I treated him like one.

920
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,333
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Be calm, Colonel.

921
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,916
Tell us what happened.

922
01:12:22,834 --> 01:12:24,499
Nothing important.

923
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:25,958
Excuse me.

924
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:33,749
Colonel...

925
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:46,291
What's the matter?

926
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:51,249
I was dreaming that I...

927
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,833
I dreamed that Sénéchal dreamed...

928
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,291
that we were going to a theatre.

929
01:12:57,459 --> 01:13:00,916
Then, that we were invited
to the Colonel's,

930
01:13:01,542 --> 01:13:04,124
who quarrelled with Raphael.

931
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,999
You're silly.
Go to sleep.

932
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,666
Relax, go to sleep.

933
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:32,499
- Good day, my Lord.
- Madam.

934
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,999
The flowers are gorgeous.
The garden has never looked better.

935
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:38,624
That's very kind of you.

936
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:43,874
By the way, we're having
a few friends for lunch today.

937
01:14:44,209 --> 01:14:46,041
I hope you'll join us.

938
01:14:46,209 --> 01:14:49,999
- I'd love to, but I have work.
- I'd be delighted.

939
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:53,041
Just close friends.

940
01:14:53,209 --> 01:14:55,124
Come whenever you can.

941
01:14:55,292 --> 01:15:00,124
I'll finish what I have to do,
and then I'll come.

942
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:02,416
I suggest planting

943
01:15:02,584 --> 01:15:05,833
a border of hydrangeas
on each side of the door.

944
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,458
Would you come and take a look?

945
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,083
I plan laying out
two paths of hydrangeas

946
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:18,958
from the door to the house.

947
01:15:20,334 --> 01:15:22,749
- Good day to you.
- What do you want?

948
01:15:22,917 --> 01:15:24,874
Where can I find a priest?

949
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:27,916
You ought to go to the parish church.

950
01:15:28,084 --> 01:15:31,624
But Madam, I am a priest.

951
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:33,541
What is it about?

952
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:37,166
An old man who's dying
needs absolution.

953
01:15:37,334 --> 01:15:39,624
Wait for me.
I'll be back.

954
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:41,916
Who is it?

955
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:44,916
The man is very old and very poor.

956
01:15:45,084 --> 01:15:47,166
He lives in a farm nearby.

957
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:51,083
He used to be a gardener.
He is very ill.

958
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,708
Then a doctor is what he needs.

959
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:55,083
He says it's too late for a doctor.

960
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,958
A priest is what he needs.

961
01:15:57,125 --> 01:15:59,166
Wait here.

962
01:16:35,917 --> 01:16:37,666
Father...

963
01:16:39,042 --> 01:16:41,083
I want to tell you something.

964
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:43,083
Speak up.

965
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:46,208
I don't like Jesus Christ at all.

966
01:16:47,084 --> 01:16:50,999
Ever since a little girl,
I've hated him.

967
01:16:51,167 --> 01:16:52,374
How come?

968
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:56,499
Such a kind, gentle God?
How is it possible?

969
01:16:56,667 --> 01:16:58,791
You want to know why?

970
01:17:00,709 --> 01:17:03,916
I have to see this invalid.
We'll talk about it later.

971
01:17:04,084 --> 01:17:06,166
I have carrots to deliver.

972
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:09,333
I'll tell you when I come back.

973
01:17:32,667 --> 01:17:35,999
You asked for a priest.
Here I am.

974
01:17:36,167 --> 01:17:38,708
I bring you the solace of religion.

975
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:42,374
- Do you wish to confess?
- Yes, confess.

976
01:17:42,542 --> 01:17:44,416
I'm listening.

977
01:17:44,584 --> 01:17:46,333
Tell me your sins.

978
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,958
Father...

979
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:50,749
years ago,
I committed a crime.

980
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:53,666
I killed a man and a woman.

981
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:55,499
Who?

982
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:56,958
My employers.

983
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:58,749
I killed them both.

984
01:17:58,917 --> 01:18:01,666
They were so hard on me.

985
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:05,791
Look there, the photo.
That's them.

986
01:18:06,209 --> 01:18:07,874
Him and her.

987
01:18:08,042 --> 01:18:12,624
The man behind them
with a rake is me.

988
01:18:13,584 --> 01:18:15,749
I was a gardener...

989
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:17,999
Such a long time ago.

990
01:18:20,709 --> 01:18:22,833
And you know this little boy?

991
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,624
That was their son.

992
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:28,583
Yes... That was me.

993
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:33,458
I remember this photo.
I saw it often.

994
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:36,583
The couple you killed
was my father and mother.

995
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:40,083
The culprit was never found.

996
01:18:43,417 --> 01:18:45,124
That was me.

997
01:18:45,709 --> 01:18:48,583
They treated me like an animal.

998
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:51,374
He was beastly.

999
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:53,499
And she... she...

1000
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,249
Calm down.

1001
01:18:57,667 --> 01:19:00,791
You want absolution
before you appear before God?

1002
01:19:00,959 --> 01:19:03,041
Yes, for pity's sake.

1003
01:19:03,209 --> 01:19:04,583
God, in His kindness,

1004
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:07,624
forgives the most hardened sinners.

1005
01:19:07,792 --> 01:19:11,958
What an example,
His bringing us together here.

1006
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:13,374
Close your eyes.

1007
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:15,499
Collect yourself...

1008
01:19:15,667 --> 01:19:17,416
and pray.

1009
01:19:17,959 --> 01:19:20,874
May Jesus Christ forgive you.

1010
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,458
And I, on His authority,
forgive your sins.

1011
01:19:25,542 --> 01:19:29,708
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1012
01:19:36,334 --> 01:19:38,458
Go in peace, now.

1013
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:35,666
Do you want to drink,
or would you rather eat?

1014
01:20:35,834 --> 01:20:37,458
I'm starving.

1015
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,624
Then let's eat.

1016
01:20:39,917 --> 01:20:42,583
We have omelette with truffles...

1017
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,916
and a guinea-fowl with morels.

1018
01:20:45,542 --> 01:20:47,666
Ines, you may serve dinner.

1019
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:52,041
The bishop should be here,
but he had to see a dying man.

1020
01:20:52,209 --> 01:20:53,833
Should we wait for him?

1021
01:20:54,042 --> 01:20:57,916
No.
He said to start without him.

1022
01:20:58,084 --> 01:21:00,249
Any plans for this summer?

1023
01:21:00,417 --> 01:21:03,624
- No.
- We haven't either, why?

1024
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:06,208
What about coming to Miranda?

1025
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:09,041
- Miranda?
- All of you, as my guests.

1026
01:21:09,209 --> 01:21:12,541
You'd have a chance
to discover my country.

1027
01:21:12,959 --> 01:21:15,666
Summer over there
must be terribly hot.

1028
01:21:16,209 --> 01:21:19,999
Miranda's in the southern hemisphere.
Summer here is winter there.

1029
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:22,416
- Isn't that so?
- Naturally.

1030
01:21:22,584 --> 01:21:25,583
We French know nothing
about geography.

1031
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,041
That's true.

1032
01:21:27,417 --> 01:21:31,124
Ines, answer the door.
It must be his Lordship.

1033
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:35,708
Rumour has it that you're going
to be a Minister.

1034
01:21:35,917 --> 01:21:37,874
Police! Open the door!

1035
01:21:39,292 --> 01:21:41,541
In the name of the law!

1036
01:21:41,709 --> 01:21:43,791
Police!

1037
01:21:48,709 --> 01:21:50,583
Raphael Acosta?

1038
01:21:51,334 --> 01:21:52,999
Yes?

1039
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:54,583
Inspector Delecluse.

1040
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:57,749
You are Raphael Acosta,
Ambassador of Miranda?

1041
01:21:57,917 --> 01:21:58,749
That's me.

1042
01:21:58,917 --> 01:22:00,583
You're under arrest.

1043
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:02,499
- What?
- Under arrest.

1044
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:03,833
You can't.

1045
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,833
I can. You're not in your Embassy.

1046
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,374
Here's the warrant.

1047
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:10,124
What about immunity?

1048
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:13,999
I don't give a fig about it.
Take him away.

1049
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:17,291
lnspector, there must be a mistake.

1050
01:22:17,459 --> 01:22:19,083
He can't have done...

1051
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:21,541
- You are Henri Sénéchal?
- I am.

1052
01:22:21,709 --> 01:22:23,541
You're under arrest.

1053
01:22:23,709 --> 01:22:26,333
This is intolerable.
I want to call my lawyer.

1054
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,458
Nothing doing.
Take him away.

1055
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:32,666
lnspector Delecluse?

1056
01:22:32,834 --> 01:22:35,416
What a coincidence!
We're neighbours.

1057
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:37,999
I know your charming little girl.

1058
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:41,249
Are you François Thévenot?

1059
01:22:41,417 --> 01:22:43,999
- I am.
- You're under arrest.

1060
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:45,291
What's the charge?

1061
01:22:45,459 --> 01:22:48,458
You'll know at the police station.
A nice catch!

1062
01:22:49,292 --> 01:22:51,874
You can't arrest people
just like that.

1063
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:54,458
Take the women as well.
Quick!

1064
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:55,458
Come on.

1065
01:22:55,625 --> 01:22:58,458
Don't touch me!

1066
01:22:59,959 --> 01:23:01,833
Let go of me!

1067
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,333
You can't...

1068
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,416
Leave me alone!
How dare you!

1069
01:23:06,584 --> 01:23:08,833
Take your hands off me!

1070
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,416
Search the whole house,
the bedrooms, the cellar...

1071
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,791
- What is it?
- Drug traffic.

1072
01:23:36,959 --> 01:23:38,749
Big shots, it seems.

1073
01:23:38,917 --> 01:23:40,791
Good evening.

1074
01:23:46,334 --> 01:23:48,083
What's the hurry?

1075
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:50,833
- What day's today?
- June 14th.

1076
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,583
I forgot.

1077
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:55,124
- Obviously you're new here.
- Why?

1078
01:23:55,292 --> 01:23:58,374
June 14th is
the bloody sergeant's day.

1079
01:23:58,542 --> 01:24:00,874
Never heard of it?

1080
01:24:01,042 --> 01:24:02,083
Never.

1081
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,791
Listen...
It happened at the time

1082
01:24:04,959 --> 01:24:08,999
the police were desperately trying
to win the love of the people.

1083
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:11,999
- Remember?
- I remember very well.

1084
01:24:16,209 --> 01:24:18,499
Did you call the Home Secretary?

1085
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:20,624
When can I get my lawyer?

1086
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:23,416
- It's shameful!
- We're women.

1087
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:27,666
- Are you staying?
- A bit longer.

1088
01:24:27,834 --> 01:24:31,666
- It's June 14th, don't forget.
- I won't forget.

1089
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:38,041
As I was telling you...

1090
01:24:38,917 --> 01:24:42,624
at the time,
there was a sergeant so strict...

1091
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:44,708
That's him, up there.

1092
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:47,499
He was ruining our efforts
to be loved.

1093
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:50,999
But even so, he was a decent sort.

1094
01:25:02,417 --> 01:25:03,833
Well?

1095
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,791
Still silent?

1096
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:08,333
Will you talk?

1097
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:17,041
So, you won't talk?

1098
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:27,499
Look...
I'll give you one last chance.

1099
01:25:27,667 --> 01:25:29,666
Will you talk or not?

1100
01:25:32,042 --> 01:25:33,583
Carry on.

1101
01:25:34,084 --> 01:25:36,166
- How's your wife?
- So-so.

1102
01:25:36,334 --> 01:25:37,708
Will it be a boy or a girl?

1103
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:40,333
I hope it'll be a girl.
I already have two sons...

1104
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,999
No! None of that!

1105
01:25:47,834 --> 01:25:50,416
You didn't plant
the plastic charge?

1106
01:25:50,584 --> 01:25:53,749
You're a nice boy.
Your views are sound.

1107
01:25:53,917 --> 01:25:56,416
But you know who did it.
So, talk.

1108
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:59,291
And tomorrow,
you'll see your girlfriend.

1109
01:25:59,459 --> 01:26:01,583
I have no girlfriend.

1110
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,958
You enjoy making an ass of me?

1111
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:06,333
Too bad. You asked for it.

1112
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,583
We'll have him play the piano.

1113
01:26:27,959 --> 01:26:29,458
No!

1114
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:31,499
We won't kill you.

1115
01:26:45,084 --> 01:26:47,624
Now will you talk?

1116
01:26:47,792 --> 01:26:49,416
Nothing to say?

1117
01:26:59,459 --> 01:27:01,583
So one day, June 14th,

1118
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:03,999
he was murdered
during a demonstration.

1119
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:08,416
Ever since, on that date, every year,
he returns to redeem himself.

1120
01:27:08,584 --> 01:27:10,833
- Tonight?
- Definitely.

1121
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,541
Stay if you like. I'm off.
I don't want to meet him.

1122
01:27:14,709 --> 01:27:16,874
I'm going too.
Wait for me.

1123
01:28:40,417 --> 01:28:41,791
No!

1124
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,124
Stop!

1125
01:28:44,292 --> 01:28:46,374
Don't let them get away!

1126
01:28:46,542 --> 01:28:47,416
No.

1127
01:28:47,584 --> 01:28:51,124
What's going on, Sir?

1128
01:28:52,917 --> 01:28:54,291
Oh, it's you.

1129
01:28:54,459 --> 01:28:56,833
I was washing my hands.
I thought you called me.

1130
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,583
Just imagine: I dreamt
that you had released the prisoners.

1131
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:04,124
Me?

1132
01:29:04,584 --> 01:29:07,874
What a face you had!
Like a slaughtered ox!

1133
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:11,958
Sometimes dreams are really...

1134
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,999
Yes?

1135
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:18,374
Hold on.

1136
01:29:18,542 --> 01:29:19,416
It's for you.

1137
01:29:19,584 --> 01:29:22,208
The Home Secretary to talk to you.

1138
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:31,208
Yes, speaking.

1139
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,874
Yes, I'll wait.

1140
01:29:38,959 --> 01:29:40,624
lnspector Delecluse?

1141
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,624
Listen.

1142
01:29:42,792 --> 01:29:46,083
You arrested the Ambassador
of Miranda and his friends.

1143
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:47,958
Release them immediately.

1144
01:29:48,834 --> 01:29:50,166
But, Minister,

1145
01:29:50,334 --> 01:29:52,499
it's already on record.
I can't...

1146
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,541
Forget that. Do as I tell you.

1147
01:29:55,709 --> 01:29:56,916
Release them immediately.

1148
01:29:57,917 --> 01:30:00,708
May I know at least the reasons?

1149
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:06,958
Our diplomatic relations...

1150
01:30:15,209 --> 01:30:16,541
I beg your pardon?

1151
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:18,916
I didn't hear.

1152
01:30:19,542 --> 01:30:22,291
You didn't hear me?

1153
01:30:32,042 --> 01:30:33,624
Yes...

1154
01:30:34,209 --> 01:30:35,833
Very well.

1155
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,083
I got it.

1156
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:42,958
Sergeant!

1157
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:47,666
Yes, Sir?

1158
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:51,166
Release the prisoners.

1159
01:30:57,834 --> 01:30:59,958
Right away.

1160
01:31:22,167 --> 01:31:25,166
And... you spoke to the Minister?

1161
01:31:25,334 --> 01:31:26,666
Of course!

1162
01:31:26,834 --> 01:31:28,499
I called to thank him.

1163
01:31:28,667 --> 01:31:31,583
- I invited him to Miranda next year.
- And?

1164
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:33,499
He'll do his best to come.

1165
01:31:33,667 --> 01:31:35,374
What time is it?

1166
01:31:35,542 --> 01:31:37,083
Quarter to nine.

1167
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:40,916
I hope they won't be late.
My leg of lamb will be overdone.

1168
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:44,708
Here they are.

1169
01:31:50,959 --> 01:31:53,624
Are we late?

1170
01:31:53,792 --> 01:31:57,416
- Not at all. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

1171
01:31:59,959 --> 01:32:02,833
- What a lovely dress.
- Thank you.

1172
01:32:03,917 --> 01:32:05,624
Good evening.

1173
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,958
- Good to see you, Raphael.
- Likewise.

1174
01:32:09,959 --> 01:32:11,958
What incredible traffic jams.

1175
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:15,124
- It's Saturday.
- I should've set out earlier.

1176
01:32:15,292 --> 01:32:18,124
We ran across
150 or 200 cyclists, at least.

1177
01:32:18,542 --> 01:32:20,374
Let's skip cocktails.

1178
01:32:20,542 --> 01:32:24,166
We'll start with dinner
or my lamb will be overdone.

1179
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:26,541
Good! I'm starving.

1180
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:28,083
So am I.

1181
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:33,708
I prepared a soup
with herbs from the garden.

1182
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:35,124
A very good idea.

1183
01:32:35,292 --> 01:32:37,249
I cooked it myself.

1184
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:40,083
Sit where you want.

1185
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:41,958
François on my right,

1186
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:44,166
Raphael, here.

1187
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:51,499
I nearly didn't make soup.
Then I thought:

1188
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:54,958
is a meal without soup
really a meal?

1189
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:11,791
Well, Ines, how's your fiancé?

1190
01:33:11,959 --> 01:33:13,749
We broke off, Madam.

1191
01:33:13,917 --> 01:33:15,458
Why?

1192
01:33:15,625 --> 01:33:17,333
He left for the army
for 2 years.

1193
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:20,333
- You could wait for him.
- He didn't want that.

1194
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,333
He said I'm already too old.

1195
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:25,124
- How old are you?
- 52, Madam.

1196
01:33:25,292 --> 01:33:26,833
Well, I understand.

1197
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,458
She was my parents' servant
when I was a child.

1198
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:33,291
I read that in Miranda,
they arrested a Nazi.

1199
01:33:33,459 --> 01:33:37,916
Von what's-his-name... A former
concentration camp commander.

1200
01:33:38,084 --> 01:33:40,874
It seems he was a real butcher.

1201
01:33:41,959 --> 01:33:45,916
Calling him a butcher
seems a bit extreme to me.

1202
01:33:46,084 --> 01:33:49,333
I met him once.

1203
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,874
I tell you that
he's a perfect gentleman.

1204
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:54,958
It's not incompatible.
One can be poor and a thief.

1205
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:57,583
And rich and honest, darling.

1206
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:01,374
What clothes did this
von what's-his-name wear?

1207
01:34:02,792 --> 01:34:04,124
Did he like animals?

1208
01:34:04,292 --> 01:34:07,166
He always went for a walk
with a big dog.

1209
01:34:07,334 --> 01:34:11,124
There are lots of Nazis in Miranda.
True?

1210
01:34:11,292 --> 01:34:13,958
- You like the soup?
- Delicious.

1211
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:15,999
Add some salt, if you like.

1212
01:34:16,167 --> 01:34:18,583
I'm sure it's perfect, as usual.

1213
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:20,249
I'll be right back.

1214
01:34:20,417 --> 01:34:22,499
Just going to check the lamb.

1215
01:34:29,584 --> 01:34:31,666
- What time is it?
- 9:10, Madam.

1216
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:34,416
Take it out of the oven.
25 minutes per pound

1217
01:34:34,584 --> 01:34:36,583
is long enough.

1218
01:34:48,667 --> 01:34:50,083
Very good.

1219
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:09,041
Many people don't know it,
but to carve lamb,

1220
01:35:09,209 --> 01:35:11,416
you have to stand up,
isn't that so?

1221
01:35:11,584 --> 01:35:13,791
It's more proper.
Bear that in mind.

1222
01:35:13,959 --> 01:35:15,541
Thanks for the lesson.

1223
01:35:15,709 --> 01:35:17,874
Tell me Raphael,
when were you born?

1224
01:35:18,042 --> 01:35:21,458
February 22, 1920.

1225
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:23,208
Then you're a Pisces.

1226
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:24,916
Sagittarius ascendant.

1227
01:35:25,084 --> 01:35:26,916
That's very interesting.

1228
01:35:27,084 --> 01:35:29,833
- Shall I serve you, Simone?
- Please do.

1229
01:35:31,042 --> 01:35:33,833
- Thank you.
- Hand me Raphael's plate.

1230
01:35:34,292 --> 01:35:36,541
Pisces - Sagittarius.

1231
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:39,499
The coming together
of these two signs

1232
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:43,541
enhances your personality.

1233
01:35:44,667 --> 01:35:47,374
By nature, you try to go
beyond your ego.

1234
01:35:47,959 --> 01:35:49,499
You think so?

1235
01:35:50,542 --> 01:35:52,416
François, some beans?

1236
01:35:52,584 --> 01:35:54,374
Especially in olive oil.
I love that!

1237
01:35:54,542 --> 01:35:57,124
- I put some in.
- Just for me.

1238
01:35:57,459 --> 01:35:59,791
- Raphael?
- With pleasure.

1239
01:35:59,959 --> 01:36:01,583
Excellent lamb.

1240
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:03,083
- Not overdone?
- Perfect.

1241
01:36:03,792 --> 01:36:07,291
You like to participate in life.

1242
01:36:07,459 --> 01:36:09,583
You feel driven by great thoughts

1243
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,541
and noble plans.

1244
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:16,083
Your open mind has
a global view of the world.

1245
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:18,708
Next time you dine with me.

1246
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:20,708
You'll taste caviar with a spoon.

1247
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:22,749
You like that.

1248
01:36:22,917 --> 01:36:26,249
Florence will mix her famous drink,
vodka and aquavit.

1249
01:36:26,417 --> 01:36:27,833
Yes!

1250
01:36:28,542 --> 01:36:33,499
Your sensitivity is in harmony
with your humanitarian conscience.

1251
01:36:33,667 --> 01:36:36,666
But if you reject approved ideas,

1252
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:40,458
you must replace them
with your own morals.

1253
01:36:42,584 --> 01:36:45,833
I always followed
the dictates of my conscience.

1254
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,416
More lamb, Raphael?

1255
01:36:47,584 --> 01:36:48,833
With pleasure.

1256
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,541
- You like it medium?
- I don't care.

1257
01:36:51,709 --> 01:36:52,958
It's delicious.

1258
01:36:53,125 --> 01:36:54,541
Maybe I'm a bit perverse,

1259
01:36:54,709 --> 01:36:58,333
but I've a weakness
for American canned beans.

1260
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:12,749
Everybody stand up!

1261
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:15,874
Ladies too!

1262
01:37:17,084 --> 01:37:20,416
- What is this?
- Hands behind your head!

1263
01:37:20,584 --> 01:37:23,791
Move over there... quickly!

1264
01:37:27,542 --> 01:37:29,541
At least, let us explain.

1265
01:37:29,709 --> 01:37:30,916
You're misinformed.

1266
01:37:31,084 --> 01:37:32,333
Everybody to the rear!

1267
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,583
To the rear!

1268
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:37,874
And quickly!

1269
01:37:38,959 --> 01:37:41,208
When we've searched the house,

1270
01:37:41,375 --> 01:37:43,916
then we'll have time to talk.

1271
01:37:47,167 --> 01:37:49,333
What are you going to do?

1272
01:38:11,209 --> 01:38:12,124
Look!

1273
01:38:35,667 --> 01:38:37,833
Are you ill, Sir?

1274
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:40,874
You shouted.

1275
01:38:41,042 --> 01:38:43,708
- Do you want anything?
- No.

1276
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:44,958
Nothing.

1277
01:38:45,125 --> 01:38:47,541
Go to bed.
