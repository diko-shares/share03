<i>Bast...</i>

2
00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:08.883
<i>time is running out.</i>

3
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:12.428
<i>Please allow me to heal my brother
of this illness...</i>

4
00:00:13.137 --> 00:00:15.765
and I will never
question your existence again.

5
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:18.309
His heart rate is dropping fast.
Where are we?

6
00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:19.727
We are finishing a sequence now.

7
00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:21.437
GRIOT, give me the controls.

8
00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:22.897
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

9
00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.196
What is the confidence rate?

10
00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:31.822
<i>25%.</i>

11
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.492
We'll have to try another way.

12
00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.995
<i>King T'Challa's heart rate
has fallen to 31 beats per minute.</i>

13
00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:40.706
Princess, you should go be by his side.

14
00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:43.292
I have to think.
Everyone, get out.

15
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.711
Get out!

16
00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:53.010
What is the confidence rate?

17
00:00:53.177 --> 00:00:54.554
<i>29. 1 %.</i>

18
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.721
Print it!

19
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:04.355
<i>Princess, I am aware of the urgency,
but I must warn you...</i>

20
00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:06.315
<i>this synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...</i>

21
00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:08.776
<i>has a minimal chance of
producing the desired effects.</i>

22
00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:12.029
I don't care! Has to work.

23
00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.300
GRIOT.

24
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:33.467
<i>Yes, Princess?</i>

25
00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:35.886
What's my brother's heart rate?

26
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:45.730
Your brother is with the ancestors.

27
00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.196
No.

28
00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:05.333
We give thanks for the gift of King T'Challa.

29
00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:11.005
The Black Panther.

30
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.343
Son of King T'Chaka.

31
00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:16.927
My son.

32
00:02:17.094 --> 00:02:22.433
Descendant of the most revered King Bashenga,

33
00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:25.394
the first Black Panther.

34
00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.647
We release you.

35
00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:29.899
Praise the ancestors.

36
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.007
<i>T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa</i>

37
00:02:56.008 --> 00:03:00.012

43
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.249
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:37.062
It is an honor for me...

45
00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.815
to invite her majesty, Queen Ramonda...

46
00:06:40.024 --> 00:06:43.485
daughter of Lumumba,
sovereign ruler of the kingdom of Wakanda.

47
00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:59.710
Mr. Chairperson...

48
00:06:59.877 --> 00:07:04.381
I believe I speak for
all the member states here...

49
00:07:04.548 --> 00:07:08.302
when I say that
I am deeply disappointed in Wakanda's...

50
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:13.265
failure to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts...

51
00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:17.603
to tackle international challenges,
to share resources...

52
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.313
and full cooperation...

53
00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:21.649
concerning vibranium.

54
00:07:21.815 --> 00:07:28.822
France has information that vibranium can be
used to make weapons of mass destruction.

55
00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:32.743
It does not trigger any known metal detector.

56
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:39.249
It is a threat to global security
and the non-proliferation regime.

57
00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:42.753
I now give the floor to
Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda.

58
00:07:49.885 --> 00:07:52.680
It has always been our policy...

59
00:07:52.846 --> 00:07:57.810
to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.

60
00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:02.856
Not because of the dangerous potential
of vibranium...

61
00:08:03.023 --> 00:08:07.528
but because of
the dangerous potential of you.

62
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.166
I just lost security visuals.

63
00:08:25.754 --> 00:08:28.424
Down on your stomachs right now!

64
00:08:28.549 --> 00:08:30.050
Face to the floor! Go! Go!

65
00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:32.386
Where are the vibranium tools?

66
00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:37.266
Who has access?

67
00:08:48.235 --> 00:08:52.698
You perform civility here.

68
00:08:53.157 --> 00:08:55.492
But we know what you whisper...

69
00:08:55.659 --> 00:08:59.997
in your halls of leadership
and in your military facilities.

70
00:09:04.918 --> 00:09:07.713
"The King is dead.

71
00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:12.468
"The Black Panther is gone.

72
00:09:14.386 --> 00:09:17.639
"They have lost their protector.

73
00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:26.774
<i>"Now is our time...</i>

74
00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:29.401
"to strike."

75
00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:58.597
Aneka, where is your spear?

76
00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:00.099
Shuri gave me these to try.

77
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:04.561
You know, I like them better.

78
00:10:04.728 --> 00:10:06.230
Our foremothers gave us the spear...

79
00:10:06.396 --> 00:10:09.191
because it is precise, elegant...

80
00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:12.027
and deadly.

81
00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:17.199
It will not change under my watch.

82
00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:20.577
Yes, General.

83
00:10:21.161 --> 00:10:22.996
I told you not to bring them.

84
00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.712
Last night there was another attack
on one of our outreach facilities.

85
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.217
Proof of the involvement of a member state...

86
00:10:35.384 --> 00:10:39.429
is being uploaded to your mobile devices
as we speak.

87
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:43.559
And as for the identity of the attackers...

88
00:10:56.113 --> 00:10:57.698
Kneel!

89
00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:02.536
You're welcome.

90
00:11:03.328 --> 00:11:09.293
Let our gracious response to this incursion
be an olive branch.

91
00:11:11.086 --> 00:11:14.173
Further attempts on our resources...

92
00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:17.426
will be considered an act of aggression...

93
00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:21.346
and met with a much steeper response.

94
00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:25.517
We mourn the loss of our king.

95
00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:31.106
But do not think for a second
that Wakanda has lost her ability...

96
00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:33.817
to protect our resources.

97
00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:37.988
We are aware
of the ongoing efforts by some...

98
00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:41.408
to find vibranium outside of Wakanda...

99
00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:45.704
and wish you the best of luck.

100
00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:53.962
<i>This is Rotor 625
requesting clearance to land.</i>

101
00:11:58.175 --> 00:11:59.176
All right. Meet you down there.

102
00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:00.344
Yeah.

103
00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:03.972
Hey!

104
00:12:04.723 --> 00:12:05.933
I thought you retired!

105
00:12:06.099 --> 00:12:07.142
I thought I had too.

106
00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:10.646
They said that machine had a one
in a billion chance of finding vibranium.

107
00:12:10.812 --> 00:12:12.022
Oh, less than that.

108
00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:35.087
Here we go.

109
00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:39.091
<i>Cabin pressure is stable
at negative one P-S-I.</i>

110
00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:45.806
<i>At 800 feet...</i>

111
00:12:45.973 --> 00:12:47.933
<i>passing through thermocline.</i>

112
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.768
<i>All my life supports in the green.</i>

113
00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:52.980
Copy you.

114
00:13:02.322 --> 00:13:03.699
<i>We've touched down.</i>

115
00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:14.876
Perfect. So, Salazar,
you are near the site right there.

116
00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:18.213
<i>Yeah, it's astonishing.</i>

117
00:13:20.215 --> 00:13:23.051
<i>The drill seemed to make contact
with a metallic substance.</i>

118
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:26.013
<i>Whatever it is, it's solid.</i>

119
00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:28.682
<i>I've never seen a drill bit
chewed up like this before.</i>

120
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:33.353
I'll be.

121
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:35.605
Vibranium in the ocean.

122
00:13:35.772 --> 00:13:37.482
Let's go ahead
and get the detector out of there...

123
00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:39.568
since it's the only one we've got.

124
00:13:40.527 --> 00:13:42.904
<i>Heading towards the vibranium detector.</i>

125
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:55.917
Okay, Salazar, we just went dark.

126
00:13:56.084 --> 00:13:57.669
<i>Yeah. The rig lost power.</i>

127
00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.088
Copy that. I'm gonna fix it up here.

128
00:14:16.104 --> 00:14:17.105
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

129
00:14:30.994 --> 00:14:32.329
<i>Jackson...</i>

130
00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:34.247
<i>Tell me you're seeing this?</i>

131
00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:36.375
Hang on. Salazar's heart rate.

132
00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:38.710
Hey, Salazar, can you give me a visual?

133
00:14:40.587 --> 00:14:42.714
<i>It's a phantom jellyfish.</i>

134
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:44.341
<i>I've never seen one this color.</i>

135
00:14:45.133 --> 00:14:46.635
Emergency dive team, stand by.

136
00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:49.554
Salazar, we just lost Jackson's vitals.

137
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:50.847
<i>Can you see him?</i>

138
00:14:58.855 --> 00:15:00.649
<i>No. He's gone.</i>

139
00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:02.734
Can you clarify?
What do you mean by, "He's gone"?

140
00:15:04.694 --> 00:15:05.987
Salazar, do you copy?

141
00:15:07.531 --> 00:15:08.532
Salazar?

142
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.287
<i>Smitty, we got a situation out here.</i>

143
00:15:26.216 --> 00:15:27.300
What's that sound?

144
00:15:27.634 --> 00:15:29.428
West, you got a visual on
what's making that sound?

145
00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:37.436
West, how copy, over?

146
00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:41.982
<i>West, you got a visual?</i>

147
00:16:01.209 --> 00:16:02.627
It's some kind of sonic attack.

148
00:16:02.794 --> 00:16:04.588
Hey, Smitty, earplugs.

149
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.846
We are under attack.

150
00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:14.764
You need to send in
a strike team immediately.

151
00:16:14.931 --> 00:16:17.934
Copy.
Mayday, mayday, this is Rotor 625.

152
00:16:18.018 --> 00:16:19.436
We are requesting assistance immediately.

153
00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:20.604
It's the Wakandans.

154
00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:24.149
It has to be.

155
00:16:40.081 --> 00:16:41.082
Henderson.

156
00:16:41.249 --> 00:16:42.501
Smitty, we gotta go.

157
00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:44.085
Henderson!

158
00:16:45.045 --> 00:16:46.046
Let's go.

159
00:16:48.882 --> 00:16:49.925
What's going on?

160
00:16:50.717 --> 00:16:51.718
Get off the edge.

161
00:17:08.401 --> 00:17:09.444
Go!

162
00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:31.216
Go, go, go!

163
00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:39.641
Now! Go!

164
00:17:39.808 --> 00:17:41.351
Spin! Spin them off!

165
00:17:43.019 --> 00:17:44.271
Okay. They're gone!

166
00:17:44.437 --> 00:17:45.564
Oh, my God!

167
00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:06.126
Just get us out.

168
00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:07.669
We're good.

169
00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:08.962
We're good.

170
00:18:09.129 --> 00:18:10.338
Where is the strike team?

171
00:18:10.505 --> 00:18:12.674
It wasn't the Wakandans. They were blue.

172
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:13.967
Everyone is dead...

173
00:18:15.802 --> 00:18:17.596
Shit.
What is going on?

174
00:18:17.762 --> 00:18:18.888
We're getting pulled backwards.

175
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.391
Oh, my God.

176
00:18:27.772 --> 00:18:28.898
Oh, God! Hang on!

177
00:19:03.975 --> 00:19:05.644
<i>Queen Ramonda of the nation of Wakanda...</i>

<i>A year has passed since Queen Ramonda...</i>

182
00:19:14.903 --> 00:19:16.821
<i>was reinstated as ruler of Wakanda...</i>

183
00:19:16.988 --> 00:19:20.492
<i>after King T'Challa's sudden death
from an undisclosed illness last year.</i>

184
00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.661
<i>All eyes are on the tiny, powerful nation...</i>

185
00:19:22.827 --> 00:19:25.372
<i>as it finds itself increasingly isolated...</i>

186
00:19:25.538 --> 00:19:27.248
My Queen.

187
00:19:27.832 --> 00:19:29.751
Approaching the river border.

188
00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:38.009
We are home.

189
00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:28.935
<i>Princess.</i>

190
00:20:29.102 --> 00:20:31.563
Just a moment.
I'm in the middle of something.

191
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.022
<i>I understand, Princess, however...</i>

192
00:20:33.189 --> 00:20:34.941
You're disrupting my train of thought.

193
00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:39.446
Shuri.

194
00:20:39.988 --> 00:20:40.989
Mother.

195
00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:44.033
<i>I was trying to tell you.
The Queen is here.</i>

196
00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:46.202
-Thank you.
-That thing unnerves me.

197
00:20:46.703 --> 00:20:50.206
I think that one clay artificial intelligence
is going to kill us all.

198
00:20:50.373 --> 00:20:54.919
My Al isn't like the movies, Mother.
It does exactly what I tell it to do.

199
00:20:55.086 --> 00:20:57.547
Yeah, if only children were the same.

200
00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:01.509
Everyone seems to be working diligently.

201
00:21:02.093 --> 00:21:05.722
Yes. Rapid emergency response task.

202
00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:07.515
There could be any number of...

203
00:21:07.682 --> 00:21:11.019
unknown threats on the horizon,
and they're creating solutions.

204
00:21:12.061 --> 00:21:14.063
Oh, what is this?

205
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.857
Exo Suits for our army.

206
00:21:16.024 --> 00:21:20.570
It grants the user super-human strength,
speed, and durability.

207
00:21:20.737 --> 00:21:23.198
But, as always, Okoye had notes.

208
00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:24.532
What were her notes?

209
00:21:24.741 --> 00:21:25.992
She hates them.

210
00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:33.708
What about recreating the Heart-Shaped Herb?

211
00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:35.877
Have you made any progress on that?

212
00:21:36.044 --> 00:21:37.253
<i>Excuse me, Princess.</i>

213
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.465
<i>Nakia, daughter of Yaa,
is trying to reach you again.</i>

214
00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:41.633
<i>Maybe you should...</i>

215
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.510
Maybe you should
continue your calculations...

216
00:21:43.676 --> 00:21:44.677
as I instructed.

217
00:21:44.844 --> 00:21:46.554
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

218
00:21:47.847 --> 00:21:52.310
We do not need the Herb, Mother.
We need new technology.

219
00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:53.770
What of the Black Panther?

220
00:21:57.065 --> 00:22:00.527
The mantle has unified our nation
for centuries.

221
00:22:00.693 --> 00:22:02.904
The Black Panther is a relic, Mother.

222
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:05.448
I wasn't trying to save the mantle
with the Herb...

223
00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:07.742
I was trying to save my brother.

224
00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:10.912
Oh, Shuri.

225
00:22:24.884 --> 00:22:26.302
Do you know what day it is?

226
00:22:27.053 --> 00:22:28.263
Tuesday.

227
00:22:29.055 --> 00:22:30.557
The date, child.

228
00:22:36.729 --> 00:22:38.106
Brother's passing.

229
00:22:38.606 --> 00:22:40.191
One year ago today.

230
00:22:49.993 --> 00:22:50.994
Have you planned anything?

231
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.081
Yes. It involves you
taking your mother for a drive.

232
00:22:55.748 --> 00:22:57.083
-Right now?
-Right now.

233
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.335
And you can leave your Kimoyo Beads here.

234
00:22:59.502 --> 00:23:00.503
-Mother.
-No, no.

235
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.755
You won't need them where we are going.

236
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.305
And the other two. Yes.

237
00:23:34.162 --> 00:23:38.041
You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.

238
00:23:38.207 --> 00:23:40.585
It is the only way
you are going to heal...

239
00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:43.004
from the wound caused
by T'Challa's death.

240
00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:44.464
I'm fine, Mother.

241
00:23:45.882 --> 00:23:47.842
You don't have to worry about me.

242
00:23:49.093 --> 00:23:52.722
He's gone, but I'm moving forward.

243
00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:57.602
T'Challa is dead,
but that doesn't mean he is gone.

244
00:23:58.102 --> 00:24:00.980
When that illness
took your brother from us...

245
00:24:01.147 --> 00:24:05.652
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

246
00:24:05.818 --> 00:24:08.529
But I still took time in the bush.

247
00:24:08.696 --> 00:24:11.950
I wandered until I found water.

248
00:24:12.116 --> 00:24:13.493
And I sat.

249
00:24:15.119 --> 00:24:16.788
Then I did this ritual...

250
00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:19.374
that I am about to show you now.

251
00:24:21.918 --> 00:24:26.130
I found your brother in the breeze...

252
00:24:27.423 --> 00:24:30.802
pushing me gently, but firm.

253
00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:33.972
Like his hand on my shoulder.

254
00:24:36.474 --> 00:24:37.809
It took some time...

255
00:24:39.185 --> 00:24:41.145
but he was there.

256
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.778
He wasn't there, Mother.

257
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:51.948
The presence that you felt...

258
00:24:52.115 --> 00:24:54.033
was just a construct of your mind.

259
00:24:56.244 --> 00:24:59.998
Brought on so you could feel
some comfort or joy.

260
00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.125
That's all.

261
00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:11.884
What construct
does your mind create...

262
00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:14.012
when you think of your brother?

263
00:25:14.971 --> 00:25:16.931
Does it offer you comfort?

264
00:25:18.307 --> 00:25:19.684
Or torment?

265
00:25:33.364 --> 00:25:34.449
Come, child.

266
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:47.211
How did you get this?

267
00:25:47.378 --> 00:25:48.504
What does it matter?

268
00:25:49.338 --> 00:25:51.132
What does this have to do with your ritual?

269
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.635
Burning of the funeral garments...

270
00:25:54.802 --> 00:25:57.055
marks the end
of the mourning period...

271
00:25:57.221 --> 00:26:00.058
and the beginning
of a new relationship...

272
00:26:00.224 --> 00:26:02.477
with our loved ones that have passed on...

273
00:26:02.977 --> 00:26:04.562
I'm not doing this, Mother.

274
00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:07.273
If I sit...

275
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.984
and think about my brother
for too long...

276
00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:14.280
it won't be these clothes I'll burn.

277
00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:17.075
It will be the world...

278
00:26:18.493 --> 00:26:20.036
and everyone in it.

279
00:26:21.245 --> 00:26:22.371
Shuri...

280
00:26:26.834 --> 00:26:29.754
Shuri, there's something
that I need to tell you...

281
00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:31.589
about your brother.

282
00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:37.095
Mother, wait!

283
00:26:37.678 --> 00:26:39.097
What are you doing?

284
00:27:04.413 --> 00:27:06.249
This better not be a part of your ritual.

285
00:27:06.415 --> 00:27:07.750
It isn't.

286
00:27:09.377 --> 00:27:11.045
Stop! Right there!

287
00:27:11.712 --> 00:27:14.549
Who are you?
And how did you get in here?

288
00:27:16.092 --> 00:27:17.593
This place is amazing.

289
00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:20.596
The air is pristine.

290
00:27:22.056 --> 00:27:23.057
And the water...

291
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.727
My mother told stories
about a place like this.

292
00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:30.231
A protected land with people
that never have to leave.

293
00:27:30.398 --> 00:27:32.733
That never have to change who they were.

294
00:27:34.318 --> 00:27:37.321
What reason do you have
to reveal your secret to the world?

295
00:27:37.488 --> 00:27:40.324
I am not a woman
who enjoys repeating herself.

296
00:27:40.491 --> 00:27:42.368
Who are you?

297
00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:43.744
I have many names.

298
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.456
My people call me K'uk'ulkan...

299
00:27:50.376 --> 00:27:52.086
but my enemies call me Namor.

300
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.092
The American military detected vibranium
under my nation's domain.

301
00:27:59.093 --> 00:28:02.638
I was able to
stop them from minin' it...

302
00:28:03.556 --> 00:28:06.684
but we need Wakanda's help
to prevent it from happenin' again.

303
00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.771
They use a machine
designed by an American scientist.

304
00:28:10.938 --> 00:28:13.441
Vibranium only exists here.

305
00:28:13.608 --> 00:28:14.942
In Wakanda.

306
00:28:15.109 --> 00:28:16.485
Mother, he's covered in it.

307
00:28:20.364 --> 00:28:24.118
Your son exposed the power of vibranium
to the world.

308
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.497
In response, other nations have begun
searching the planet for it.

309
00:28:28.664 --> 00:28:32.084
His choice has compromised us.

310
00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:36.631
I think Wakanda could find the scientist
and bring them to me?

311
00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:41.385
It is only fair that Wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.

312
00:28:41.552 --> 00:28:46.807
You do not sneak into my country
and tell me what is fair.

313
00:28:48.267 --> 00:28:51.354
I have more soldiers
than this land has blades of grass.

314
00:28:52.146 --> 00:28:54.857
And they have incomparable strength.

315
00:28:55.358 --> 00:28:58.486
I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.

316
00:29:04.492 --> 00:29:06.953
When you have the scientist,
blow into this...

317
00:29:07.119 --> 00:29:08.454
place it in the ocean.

318
00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:10.915
I'll be there shortly afterwards.

319
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.670
For your own sake...

320
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.966
don't mention anything about me
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

321
00:29:28.683 --> 00:29:30.601
Did you see the wings on his ankles?

322
00:29:46.993 --> 00:29:48.202
How did he do that?

323
00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:50.579
We must convene the Council.

324
00:29:52.707 --> 00:29:56.002
Heaven Scrapers had no evidence
of any activity at all.

325
00:29:58.087 --> 00:30:02.049
Oh, the river border has been breached?

326
00:30:03.009 --> 00:30:04.468
If my soldiers were present...

327
00:30:04.885 --> 00:30:07.096
this "fish man"...

328
00:30:07.263 --> 00:30:09.015
would be bound before us
as we speak.

329
00:30:09.181 --> 00:30:11.434
If your muscle brains were present...

330
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.687
they would still be there
choking on their fuzzy adornments.

331
00:30:14.854 --> 00:30:16.022
You bald-headed demon...

332
00:30:16.188 --> 00:30:17.982
Show some respect, you two.

333
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:19.150
Respect?

334
00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:21.819
These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!

335
00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:22.987
Watch your tone, Jabari!

336
00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:37.960
As I was saying...

337
00:30:38.127 --> 00:30:40.838
there was no aerial surveillance
footage of him.

338
00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:42.340
And nothing on the radar as well.

339
00:30:42.506 --> 00:30:45.968
So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.

340
00:30:46.135 --> 00:30:49.930
He was not alone.
And claims to command a massive army.

341
00:30:50.097 --> 00:30:54.393
He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?

342
00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.561
So he can kill them?

343
00:30:55.686 --> 00:30:56.687
Do it.

344
00:30:58.981 --> 00:31:02.610
We never had to face an enemy
with access to vibranium before.

345
00:31:03.569 --> 00:31:05.488
And we have no Black Panther to protect us.

346
00:31:05.654 --> 00:31:09.950
That is because this wise Council
allowed Killmonger to take the throne...

347
00:31:10.117 --> 00:31:11.994
and burn up all of
your precious Heart-Shaped Herb.

348
00:31:12.161 --> 00:31:14.663
M'Baku, what would you have us do?

349
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.208
We should find the fish man and kill him.

350
00:31:18.501 --> 00:31:21.962
If we do what he is asking for now...

351
00:31:22.129 --> 00:31:26.425
what is to stop him from coming back
and asking for more?

352
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:36.811
As you were.

353
00:31:38.604 --> 00:31:42.733
Is it just me,
or does this keep getting uglier?

354
00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:44.068
It's you.

355
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.779
-So, does it work?
-Yes.

356
00:31:46.946 --> 00:31:50.658
This thing can detect
the altered frequency of vibranium...

357
00:31:50.825 --> 00:31:55.830
through water, stones, even heavy metals.
Whoever built this is brilliant.

358
00:31:56.163 --> 00:31:57.581
Come, look.

359
00:31:58.165 --> 00:32:00.835
Some are custom parts
and others look like...

360
00:32:01.001 --> 00:32:02.753
they gathered it from a junkyard.

361
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.506
I am still struggling to believe...

362
00:32:05.673 --> 00:32:08.217
that vibranium exists
outside of Wakanda.

363
00:32:08.384 --> 00:32:10.636
Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

364
00:32:10.803 --> 00:32:13.597
Our planet is covered of mostly water,
so it's reasonable...

365
00:32:13.764 --> 00:32:15.808
that the other one just landed there.

366
00:32:15.975 --> 00:32:18.060
This changes everything that we know.

367
00:32:18.227 --> 00:32:21.689
The Great Mound.
All of the legends and fables.

368
00:32:22.398 --> 00:32:24.275
Those stories are seared in my mind.

369
00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:26.235
That sounds very painful.

370
00:32:28.529 --> 00:32:30.531
So we have to find this scientist after all.

371
00:32:32.158 --> 00:32:33.325
I do have an idea.

372
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.995
I'm going to need the princess.

373
00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:38.164
Out of the question.

374
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.374
She is in no state to be in the field.

375
00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:41.792
My Queen,

376
00:32:42.835 --> 00:32:45.379
it may do her some good to get out.

377
00:32:45.838 --> 00:32:48.507
It might just be exactly what she needs.

378
00:32:49.049 --> 00:32:53.095
Besides, I can do this American operation
with my eyes closed.

379
00:32:53.262 --> 00:32:56.474
It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.

380
00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.058
This Namor...

381
00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:00.394
he snuck past our defenses.

382
00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:02.480
That will never happen again.

383
00:33:02.646 --> 00:33:04.231
He was not alone.

384
00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:06.150
She'll be with me.

385
00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:08.402
So...

386
00:33:09.361 --> 00:33:10.446
when are we leavin'...

387
00:33:10.613 --> 00:33:12.656
so I can see my favorite colonizer?

388
00:33:41.852 --> 00:33:42.853
Come on.

389
00:33:44.855 --> 00:33:46.315
Yeah, I got it.

390
00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:48.609
I got it.

391
00:33:50.778 --> 00:33:52.112
Will you slow down?

392
00:33:59.078 --> 00:34:00.371
You didn't think to call?

393
00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:02.623
Now, why would I have your number?

394
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.670
We are looking for the scientist
who built the vibranium detector.

395
00:34:08.087 --> 00:34:09.380
So it was you guys in the Atlantic?

396
00:34:10.422 --> 00:34:12.091
Come on. Mining ship.

397
00:34:12.258 --> 00:34:13.509
Lot of casualties.

398
00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:15.219
What happened?

399
00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:16.428
Seriously?

400
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:21.308
It was a joint operation.
Us and the SEALs.

401
00:34:21.475 --> 00:34:24.436
Thirty of their top guys,
two of our best officers...

402
00:34:24.603 --> 00:34:25.604
friends of mine.

403
00:34:26.063 --> 00:34:27.064
Gone.

404
00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:28.274
Just like that.

405
00:34:29.066 --> 00:34:30.734
You throw in the fact that
they were tracking vibranium...

406
00:34:30.901 --> 00:34:33.571
I can assure you
Wakanda had nothing to do with this.

407
00:34:34.488 --> 00:34:35.573
So who was it?

408
00:34:37.157 --> 00:34:39.034
God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work...

409
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:41.203
is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.

410
00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:43.998
For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.

411
00:34:44.164 --> 00:34:46.250
It's imperative that
we get to the scientist...

412
00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:47.918
before anything else happens.

413
00:34:48.752 --> 00:34:50.504
You owe me, Ross.

414
00:34:50.671 --> 00:34:52.172
You owe my brother.

415
00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.011
Okay, look.

416
00:34:57.803 --> 00:35:00.055
There are agents
who have been sentenced to death...

417
00:35:00.222 --> 00:35:02.308
for less than I'm about to give you now.

418
00:35:02.474 --> 00:35:03.726
And we got a new director.

419
00:35:04.393 --> 00:35:05.769
She's watching me like a hawk.

420
00:35:05.936 --> 00:35:08.522
We will be very, very careful.

421
00:35:08.689 --> 00:35:10.691
Not just careful, you gotta be fast.

422
00:35:10.858 --> 00:35:12.359
The US needs another machine...

423
00:35:12.526 --> 00:35:14.028
and this kid is the only person
in the world...

424
00:35:14.153 --> 00:35:15.154
who knows how to build one.

425
00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:16.363
So they're comin' for her.

426
00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:17.448
A kid?

427
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:28.751
Hey.

428
00:35:28.917 --> 00:35:29.960
You forgot to Venmo me.

429
00:35:30.127 --> 00:35:33.088
It slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

430
00:35:33.255 --> 00:35:36.133
Eight hundred was yesterday's price.
It's a band today.

431
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.885
That's predatory.

432
00:35:39.261 --> 00:35:40.929
I built the whole robotic hand.

433
00:35:41.096 --> 00:35:43.557
You just corrected the grip algorithm.

434
00:35:43.724 --> 00:35:45.100
And what grade did you get?

435
00:35:51.565 --> 00:35:52.566
Thanks.

436
00:35:55.569 --> 00:35:56.654
Is that an iPhone I see?

437
00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:57.821
Primitive.

438
00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:00.324
My Queen.

439
00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:03.035
We have located the scientist.

440
00:36:03.285 --> 00:36:06.872
She is in the American equivalent
of a Wakandan village school.

441
00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:08.165
<i>A school?</i>

442
00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:11.085
<i>Please tell me it is a professor.</i>

443
00:36:11.251 --> 00:36:13.045
It's a student, Mother.

444
00:36:13.212 --> 00:36:14.630
We can't give her to Namor.

445
00:36:15.464 --> 00:36:18.133
<i>Bring this student back to Wakanda.</i>

446
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.220
Yes, my Queen.

447
00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:24.765
I've got it from here.

448
00:36:25.391 --> 00:36:27.184
Wait. Maybe I should speak with her.

449
00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:28.644
It will be more discreet.

450
00:36:29.937 --> 00:36:31.063
I can be discreet.

451
00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:35.818
What?

452
00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:37.319
-Nothing.
-Is it the makeup?

453
00:36:37.486 --> 00:36:38.487
No.

454
00:36:38.654 --> 00:36:40.781
-It's the wrong shade, isn't it?
-It's the right shade.

455
00:36:40.948 --> 00:36:42.533
Fenty 440. You look good.

456
00:36:44.159 --> 00:36:46.120
I can blend in as a student.

457
00:36:47.246 --> 00:36:48.247
I can do this.

458
00:36:52.084 --> 00:36:53.585
-You get five minutes.
-Yes!

459
00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:06.849
Yo!

460
00:37:07.015 --> 00:37:08.100
Riri Williams?

461
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.064
Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more.
You gotta go to the website.

462
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:17.609
It's an encrypted file.

463
00:37:17.776 --> 00:37:18.944
I wanted to airdrop it.

464
00:37:20.154 --> 00:37:21.280
You the...

465
00:37:23.907 --> 00:37:25.492
You're Princess Shuri.

466
00:37:27.077 --> 00:37:28.662
What the hell are you doing here?

467
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:30.456
Oh, shit, am I getting recruited?

468
00:37:32.249 --> 00:37:33.250
No.

469
00:37:33.792 --> 00:37:37.171
I'm here about the vibranium detector
that you built for the CIA.

470
00:37:38.672 --> 00:37:42.593
I ain't built no detector for no CIA.
I made that for my metallurgy class.

471
00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.762
-A school project?
-Yeah.

472
00:37:45.137 --> 00:37:46.930
My professor said I'd never be able to do it.

473
00:37:48.474 --> 00:37:50.601
To be young, gifted, and Black though, right?

474
00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:55.898
Y'all probably don't say that in Wakanda.

475
00:37:58.192 --> 00:37:59.234
How old are you?

476
00:38:00.194 --> 00:38:01.487
Nineteen.

477
00:38:01.945 --> 00:38:05.783
Brilliance at a young age
is not always accepted by the elders.

478
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:08.786
How long did it take you?

479
00:38:08.952 --> 00:38:10.037
Couple months.

480
00:38:10.204 --> 00:38:11.830
-Couple months?
-The hardest part was...

481
00:38:11.997 --> 00:38:13.791
finding big enough mylar sheets
to cover the...

482
00:38:15.542 --> 00:38:17.085
Wait, did I piss off Wakanda?

483
00:38:17.252 --> 00:38:18.253
Not just us.

484
00:38:18.837 --> 00:38:20.339
This place is no longer safe for you.

485
00:38:21.131 --> 00:38:23.634
Gather your things and come with me.
Right now.

486
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.513
I got Differential Equations class in,
like, 15 minutes.

487
00:38:30.015 --> 00:38:31.016
Okay.

488
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.310
Okay.

489
00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:35.687
You wait right here.

490
00:38:36.522 --> 00:38:39.191
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...

491
00:38:42.653 --> 00:38:44.279
I had it under control.

492
00:38:45.197 --> 00:38:47.699
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

493
00:38:47.866 --> 00:38:49.535
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

494
00:38:50.202 --> 00:38:51.370
Get out!

495
00:38:51.537 --> 00:38:52.538
Hey.

496
00:38:52.704 --> 00:38:56.500
I'm warning you!
Do not take another step toward me!

497
00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:58.752
See how they teach the children
to treat their guests?

498
00:39:04.341 --> 00:39:05.592
You brought a spear in here?

499
00:39:05.759 --> 00:39:08.136
You brought a spear in here.

500
00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:09.972
I like her.

501
00:39:10.472 --> 00:39:12.766
Hey, hey, hey. Put it down, put it...

502
00:39:12.933 --> 00:39:14.434
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

503
00:39:14.977 --> 00:39:16.562
It's all right, Princess.

504
00:39:16.728 --> 00:39:18.063
Small, small girl.

505
00:39:19.147 --> 00:39:22.067
I am going to give you two options.

506
00:39:22.234 --> 00:39:24.403
You can come to Wakanda...

507
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.864
conscious or unconscious.

508
00:39:27.656 --> 00:39:30.409
You need to be conscious
of the way that you look.

509
00:39:30.576 --> 00:39:32.578
Walking round here,
all that ash on your head.

510
00:39:34.454 --> 00:39:36.498
-Oh, it's funny?
-No, it's not.

511
00:39:37.207 --> 00:39:39.042
-I told you!
-You look good.

512
00:39:39.209 --> 00:39:40.711
Calm down. We'll leave, okay?

513
00:39:41.336 --> 00:39:45.465
And she can deal with that merman
with the winged ankles...

514
00:39:45.632 --> 00:39:48.552
who wants to kill her
all by herself.

515
00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.888
-You got this.
-With your heater.

516
00:39:51.054 --> 00:39:52.180
Come on. Let's go.

517
00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:53.891
What?

518
00:40:01.189 --> 00:40:02.941
What exactly is this place?

519
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.652
I fixed a few trucks
for the head of sanitation.

520
00:40:06.445 --> 00:40:10.240
He lets me work out of this garage
in exchange.

521
00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:12.326
I just have to grab my work laptop.

522
00:40:15.037 --> 00:40:17.831
Please don't touch anything.

523
00:40:17.998 --> 00:40:20.125
You don't have to worry about that.

524
00:40:20.292 --> 00:40:23.921
It may not look like much,
but it's my life's work in here.

525
00:40:24.963 --> 00:40:28.383
So, the design for the machine
is on that laptop?

526
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:29.551
Yeah.

527
00:40:29.718 --> 00:40:32.596
And you just leave it on a desk
in a car garage?

528
00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:35.724
I got 2065-byte encryption
on that thing.

529
00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:39.019
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

530
00:40:39.186 --> 00:40:41.104
Took me the whole semester to get back in.

531
00:40:41.271 --> 00:40:43.315
Had to build a functional quantum computer...

532
00:40:43.482 --> 00:40:45.400
just to crack my own encryption.

533
00:40:45.567 --> 00:40:47.945
What is it you're building here?
Is it Stark Tech?

534
00:40:48.111 --> 00:40:50.030
I said don't touch anything.

535
00:40:50.197 --> 00:40:52.699
<i>Princess, American law enforcement

536
00:40:52.866 --> 00:40:54.242
-Shit.
-Who was that?

537
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.661
My AI.

538
00:40:57.287 --> 00:40:58.747
They are surrounding us.

539
00:41:02.751 --> 00:41:05.379
I thought you said a merman was after me.

540
00:41:05.545 --> 00:41:06.588
That's the feds.

541
00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:22.479
I do not need this shit right now!

542
00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:24.773
I swear to God, I was doing so well!

543
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.567
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

544
00:41:27.734 --> 00:41:30.362
Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of Wakanda...

545
00:41:30.529 --> 00:41:33.740
is gonna show up at my doorstep
and then shit about to pop off.

546
00:41:33.907 --> 00:41:37.577
I think that I'm actually gonna
take my chances with this merman...

547
00:41:37.744 --> 00:41:41.373
because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!

548
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.876
Hey. Namor sank an entire ship
of CIA operatives...

549
00:41:45.043 --> 00:41:48.588
<i>-This is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</i>
-...because of your little machine.

550
00:41:48.755 --> 00:41:50.716
-So those popo out there...
<i>-We have surrounded the premises.</i>

551
00:41:50.882 --> 00:41:52.426
...are the very least of your worries.

552
00:41:52.592 --> 00:41:55.137
Listen, we need to work together
to get out of here.

553
00:41:55.303 --> 00:41:57.723
General, they've got us surrounded.

554
00:41:57.889 --> 00:41:59.474
Maybe we should just split up.

555
00:41:59.933 --> 00:42:01.059
Out of the question.

556
00:42:01.226 --> 00:42:02.352
Does this vehicle work?

557
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:04.938
No.

558
00:42:05.939 --> 00:42:09.234
Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.

559
00:42:09.401 --> 00:42:13.405
Don't even think about it.
Besides, there are three of us.

560
00:42:13.572 --> 00:42:16.033
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

561
00:42:17.743 --> 00:42:18.994
I knew it.

562
00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:21.580
Don't tell me that you built this
in two months.

563
00:42:21.997 --> 00:42:24.708
I spent years on this. On and off.

564
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:27.669
Nice. Have you flown it yet?

565
00:42:27.836 --> 00:42:28.879
That thing can fly?

566
00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:32.424
There's an entire YouTube channel
dedicated to sightings of me.

567
00:42:32.966 --> 00:42:34.051
That's awesome.

568
00:42:34.509 --> 00:42:36.178
<i>-We have a warrant to detain...</i>
-Come.

569
00:42:36.344 --> 00:42:37.554
<i>...the student Riri Williams.</i>

570
00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:38.930
Wireless transmitter...

571
00:42:39.097 --> 00:42:41.308
-so we can communicate.
-Don't try to scurry off.

572
00:42:41.475 --> 00:42:43.518
<i>General Okoye, Princess Shuri...</i>

573
00:42:43.685 --> 00:42:45.729
<i>come out with your hands up.</i>

574
00:42:46.438 --> 00:42:47.481
What a hunk of junk.

575
00:42:47.647 --> 00:42:49.775
Hey, please be careful.

576
00:42:49.983 --> 00:42:51.985
<i>-You will not be placed under arrest.</i>
-Keys are on the seat.

577
00:42:52.152 --> 00:42:53.695
Once we get to
the other side of the bridge...

578
00:42:53.862 --> 00:42:55.030
we can lose them in Boston traffic.

579
00:42:55.197 --> 00:42:56.990
General, we really need to split up.

580
00:42:57.157 --> 00:43:00.410
Listen to me. We are not in your lab.
We are in the field.

581
00:43:00.577 --> 00:43:01.995
Now, get her in the car.

582
00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:03.705
Always shouting at me.

583
00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:15.634
<i>The tactical unit will breach the entrance
in three, two...</i>

584
00:43:15.801 --> 00:43:17.135
<i>one.</i>

585
00:43:18.512 --> 00:43:20.138
FBI! Don't move!

586
00:43:20.806 --> 00:43:21.807
What the hell is that?

587
00:43:21.973 --> 00:43:24.851
Oh, shit! She got an Iron Man suit?
Fall back!

588
00:43:25.018 --> 00:43:26.353
Stay where you are!

589
00:43:29.898 --> 00:43:31.024
Guess it can fly.

590
00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:32.442
-GRIOT!
<i>-Yes, Princess.</i>

591
00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:34.194
<i>-Now!
-Remote piloting activated.</i>

592
00:43:34.361 --> 00:43:35.529
Shuri! No!

593
00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.915
Let's go!

594
00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:49.126
GRIOT.

595
00:43:50.293 --> 00:43:51.586
Give me a visual.

596
00:43:59.678 --> 00:44:01.012
-GRIOT...
<i>-Yes, General?</i>

597
00:44:01.179 --> 00:44:03.056
...take me to the princess...

598
00:44:03.223 --> 00:44:05.892
or I will drive my spear
so deep into your CPU...

599
00:44:06.059 --> 00:44:09.229
you will not be able to process
basic input for a millennia.

600
00:44:09.396 --> 00:44:10.564
<i>Just one moment, General.</i>

601
00:44:10.939 --> 00:44:12.190
Okoye, I'm on my way to you.

602
00:44:23.326 --> 00:44:26.454
GRIOT, give me control of this vehicle
right now!

603
00:44:26.621 --> 00:44:28.665
<i>I am clearing you a path.</i>

604
00:44:33.461 --> 00:44:34.713
<i>She's all yours, General.</i>

605
00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.756
<i>Manual drive engaged.</i>

606
00:44:53.481 --> 00:44:54.941
We need to find an extraction point.

607
00:44:55.108 --> 00:44:56.610
There's one across the river.

608
00:45:02.824 --> 00:45:04.367
Hey, yo, they cuttin' off the bridge.

609
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.499
<i>Princess, there is a surveillance drone
locked onto you.</i>

610
00:45:11.583 --> 00:45:12.584
How high?

611
00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:14.085
<i>Thirty-thousand feet.</i>

612
00:45:20.091 --> 00:45:21.092
Hang on.

613
00:45:21.801 --> 00:45:22.802
I got it.

614
00:45:26.473 --> 00:45:27.474
Come on, Riri.

615
00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:30.143
You gotta find these differential equations.

616
00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:32.103
Once the relative velocity evens out...

617
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:34.064
Riri, I'm not sure
you can reach that drone...

618
00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:35.232
without an oxygen mask.

619
00:45:37.859 --> 00:45:40.528
<i>Oxygen level is now 55%.</i>

620
00:45:41.488 --> 00:45:43.365
Twenty-eight thousand feet.

621
00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:47.327
<i>Oxygen level is now 30%.</i>

622
00:45:50.455 --> 00:45:53.458
Maximum acceleration. I just need to
adjust my Euler angles and that should...

623
00:45:54.209 --> 00:45:55.460
drop it right on the...

624
00:46:01.967 --> 00:46:03.802
<i>Oxygen, 0%.</i>

625
00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.140
<i>The drone is no longer tracking you.</i>

626
00:46:10.058 --> 00:46:12.060
<i>Altitude, 500 feet and falling.</i>

627
00:46:12.227 --> 00:46:13.395
<i>Riri! Are you okay?</i>

628
00:46:14.729 --> 00:46:15.772
<i>-Riri!</i>
-Yeah.

629
00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:20.443
<i>I'm good.</i>

630
00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:22.404
-Incoming!
-Get out of the way!

631
00:46:22.654 --> 00:46:23.655
Oh my!

632
00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.781
<i>-Shit!
-And no worries.</i>

633
00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:26.950
<i>I got a special delivery for y'all
in three.</i> ..

634
00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:28.535
<i>Two, one...</i>

635
00:46:30.078 --> 00:46:31.204
Nice one, Riri!

636
00:46:40.171 --> 00:46:41.172
Riri!

637
00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:11.578
What just happened?
Shuri!

638
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.121
Shuri!

639
00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.473
<i>The Princess's vitals are stable, General.</i>

640
00:47:31.639 --> 00:47:34.225
<i>She should regain consciousness
momentarily.</i>

641
00:48:08.676 --> 00:48:10.762
Take another step closer...

642
00:48:11.554 --> 00:48:13.056
and I will kill you all.

643
00:48:13.765 --> 00:48:14.766
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

644
00:48:17.602 --> 00:48:18.770
Kill the scientist.

645
00:48:18.937 --> 00:48:20.563
I'll deal with the witnesses.

646
00:48:20.814 --> 00:48:21.815
OK.

647
00:48:23.566 --> 00:48:24.692
Hey, is she blue?

648
00:48:26.653 --> 00:48:28.363
Kill that woman first.

649
00:48:29.572 --> 00:48:30.573
Drop your weapon!

650
00:49:04.649 --> 00:49:06.693
Go to Namora.

651
00:50:15.803 --> 00:50:18.306
You're not worth my blade.

652
00:50:30.944 --> 00:50:32.487
What's taking so long?

653
00:50:32.862 --> 00:50:35.490
This is not a time for games.

654
00:50:44.666 --> 00:50:45.750
Okoye!

655
00:50:47.252 --> 00:50:48.253
Wait!

656
00:50:48.419 --> 00:50:49.712
<i>Activating interpretation.</i>

657
00:50:49.879 --> 00:50:50.880
I'm Shuri.

658
00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:52.340
Princess of Wakanda.

659
00:50:52.799 --> 00:50:54.592
I demand that you take me to Namor.

660
00:50:54.759 --> 00:50:56.844
Do not bring harm to this girl.

661
00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:01.641
<i>Do we take them both alive?</i>

662
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.227
<i>Yes, Attuma.</i>

663
00:51:20.535 --> 00:51:21.661
<i>Breathe.</i>

664
00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:31.588
Shuri!

665
00:51:50.023 --> 00:51:52.692
Ross, from the Agency. You got any witnesses?

666
00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:55.069
None. But we think it was the Wakandans.

667
00:51:55.486 --> 00:51:56.487
Excuse me?

668
00:51:56.654 --> 00:51:58.740
Our field office got a tip from Langley
that they were coming.

669
00:51:58.906 --> 00:52:00.700
Right. Who made that call?

670
00:52:01.743 --> 00:52:03.119
-She did.
-Director de Fontaine.

671
00:52:05.538 --> 00:52:06.748
Director de Fontaine.

672
00:52:06.914 --> 00:52:07.915
Really?

673
00:52:08.082 --> 00:52:09.083
Well...

674
00:52:10.084 --> 00:52:11.961
Agent thinks it was the Wakandans.

675
00:52:12.503 --> 00:52:15.006
Yeah, we've been on every one of them
since they took out our ship.

676
00:52:15.173 --> 00:52:16.591
That's why I wanted you here.

677
00:52:17.675 --> 00:52:18.676
You're lookin' good.

678
00:52:19.218 --> 00:52:20.428
Well, I try.

679
00:52:20.595 --> 00:52:22.013
You put that home gym in?

680
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:23.181
Yeah. Last year.

681
00:52:23.348 --> 00:52:26.059
Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your Peloton.

682
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:27.810
Howdy.

683
00:52:27.894 --> 00:52:28.895
I'm special agent in charge.

684
00:52:29.062 --> 00:52:31.898
Oh, good for you. You wanna walk me
through the evidence here, or what?

685
00:52:32.065 --> 00:52:34.233
-Yeah. Okay. After you.
-Yeah. Okay.

686
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.526
-All right.
-So, what happened here?

687
00:52:36.152 --> 00:52:37.737
We think it was a car crash...

688
00:52:37.904 --> 00:52:39.697
but we're having trouble finding the cars.

689
00:52:39.989 --> 00:52:42.075
What do you mean?
It was just like this when you found it?

690
00:52:42.241 --> 00:52:44.702
Yes. We think someone involved
got rid of the vehicles.

691
00:52:44.869 --> 00:52:47.747
-Got rid of them how?
-They dumped them into the river.

692
00:52:47.914 --> 00:52:49.123
You're kidding me.

693
00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:51.751
It's got an MIT sticker on it.

694
00:52:51.918 --> 00:52:54.295
I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.

695
00:52:54.462 --> 00:52:56.547
Hey, Ross? You got a full tank of gas?

696
00:52:56.714 --> 00:52:58.383
Can you give me a ride back to Langley?

697
00:52:59.133 --> 00:53:00.677
It's an eight-hour drive.

698
00:53:00.843 --> 00:53:02.136
Yeah. We can talk about the case.

699
00:53:02.303 --> 00:53:03.680
Actually, wouldn't mind...

700
00:53:04.764 --> 00:53:08.059
apologizing to you for a couple of things
I said during our marriage.

701
00:53:11.437 --> 00:53:12.689
They were blue.

702
00:53:13.731 --> 00:53:15.566
And they had superhuman strength.

703
00:53:16.484 --> 00:53:19.320
And they came from the water
on the backs of whales.

704
00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:23.324
I struck down three of them
with blows that should've killed them...

705
00:53:23.491 --> 00:53:25.201
but they rose again.

706
00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:28.621
I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our princess.

707
00:53:40.425 --> 00:53:41.634
Okoye...

708
00:53:42.009 --> 00:53:46.431
you will be stripped of your rank
as General of Wakanda's armies...

709
00:53:46.597 --> 00:53:49.559
and your status as Dora Milaje.

710
00:53:54.272 --> 00:53:55.398
Permission to speak...

711
00:53:55.481 --> 00:53:56.482
my Queen?

712
00:53:57.859 --> 00:53:58.901
You may.

713
00:53:59.402 --> 00:54:00.862
I beg of you.

714
00:54:02.864 --> 00:54:04.323
I have given everything.

715
00:54:05.283 --> 00:54:09.078
Let me die saving my country and that throne.

716
00:54:09.245 --> 00:54:11.247
I'm asking you, mother.

717
00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:13.207
Allow me to make this right.

718
00:54:13.374 --> 00:54:14.584
"Make it right"?

719
00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:19.338
I do not know
if my daughter is alive or dead.

720
00:54:19.505 --> 00:54:22.759
Perhaps we are being too hasty.

721
00:54:24.844 --> 00:54:29.223
She raised a spear
against her own husband for Wakanda.

722
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:31.934
Where is her treacherous husband now...

723
00:54:32.101 --> 00:54:36.397
but in a place where she can visit
if she wished? Mine...

724
00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:39.567
is with the ancestors.

725
00:54:39.734 --> 00:54:44.447
I am Queen of the most powerful nation
in the world...

726
00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:47.825
and my entire family is gone!

727
00:54:48.659 --> 00:54:51.454
Have I not given everything?

728
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.548
On your feet, General.

729
00:55:08.721 --> 00:55:10.932
I stood by you...

730
00:55:11.098 --> 00:55:14.727
after Killmonger took the throne...

731
00:55:14.894 --> 00:55:18.481
and you and the elders in this room
stood by him...

732
00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:22.276
while I ran begging to the Jabari
for protection.

733
00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:28.032
And I warned you
about taking my daughter on this mission...

734
00:55:28.199 --> 00:55:30.117
and you lost her.

735
00:55:30.868 --> 00:55:32.370
So, today...

736
00:55:33.287 --> 00:55:34.622
I am done.

737
00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:24.088
Are you here, GRIOT?

738
00:56:25.423 --> 00:56:26.674
<i>Yes, my Queen.</i>

739
00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:31.095
Were you with Shuri when she was abducted?

740
00:56:31.262 --> 00:56:32.555
<i>I was.</i>

741
00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:35.474
Are you able to track her Kimoyo Beads?

742
00:56:35.641 --> 00:56:38.144
Ballistics found slugs all over Cambridge.

743
00:56:38.311 --> 00:56:40.646
Those Wakandans really
took a tour of the city.

744
00:56:40.813 --> 00:56:43.065
I can't see how they figured out
who built it.

745
00:56:43.232 --> 00:56:45.651
That information is highly classified.

746
00:56:49.405 --> 00:56:51.407
-What is that? That's a new ringtone?
-Oh, shit.

747
00:56:52.992 --> 00:56:54.827
Director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

748
00:56:54.994 --> 00:56:56.954
It's enough with the titles.
Just take it. I don't care.

749
00:56:57.121 --> 00:56:58.706
Hey, honey sweetheart.

750
00:57:00.458 --> 00:57:03.002
No, I'm with my boss. Now.

751
00:57:03.711 --> 00:57:05.087
Actually, she's leaving.

752
00:57:05.254 --> 00:57:06.255
All right.

753
00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:08.883
I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.

754
00:57:16.265 --> 00:57:17.767
Everett Ross.

755
00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:19.060
Queen Ramonda?

756
00:57:19.226 --> 00:57:21.187
What are you doing with Shuri's Kimoyo Beads?

757
00:57:21.354 --> 00:57:23.147
I didn't know they were hers. All right?

758
00:57:23.314 --> 00:57:25.566
I just found them
at a pretty ugly crime scene.

759
00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:27.735
Do you have the student?

760
00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:31.572
Shuri was trying to save her
when they were both taken.

761
00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:33.950
What? Taken by who?

762
00:57:35.534 --> 00:57:37.578
My agency assumes it was you.

763
00:57:37.745 --> 00:57:39.705
And I'm worried
they might be onto the fact...

764
00:57:39.872 --> 00:57:42.041
that I pointed Shuri and Okoye
in the right direction.

765
00:57:42.208 --> 00:57:43.834
Look, if they're in danger, I wanna help.

766
00:57:44.001 --> 00:57:45.920
But I can't if I don't know what's going on.

767
00:57:46.087 --> 00:57:48.798
I am afraid there is
a new world power at play.

768
00:57:49.215 --> 00:57:52.176
A country that's already on our radar?
Or you mean someone else?

769
00:57:52.343 --> 00:57:54.345
<i>That is all I can say for now.</i>

770
00:57:54.512 --> 00:57:55.513
Please...

771
00:57:55.930 --> 00:58:00.309
alert me if your government
decides to act on their suspicions.

772
00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:02.144
Yeah. Sure.

773
00:58:02.353 --> 00:58:06.107
Look, if there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.

774
00:58:06.273 --> 00:58:08.067
I owe Shuri my life.

775
00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:12.738
GRIOT, did Shuri have her earrings with her?

776
00:58:12.905 --> 00:58:15.449
<i>I lost track of them in the North Atlantic...</i>

777
00:58:15.616 --> 00:58:18.786
<i>but the people who took her
spoke Yucatec Mayan.</i>

778
00:58:28.754 --> 00:58:29.755
Hello.

779
00:58:36.387 --> 00:58:37.972
You're here for the headmistress?

780
00:58:45.146 --> 00:58:46.147
She's there.

781
00:58:47.064 --> 00:58:48.816
Very good.

782
00:58:56.198 --> 00:58:57.199
Hello.

783
00:59:03.372 --> 00:59:06.876
Please excuse us for a moment.

784
00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:12.048
Hello.

785
00:59:12.131 --> 00:59:13.132
Hello.

786
00:59:13.215 --> 00:59:14.216
Hello.

787
00:59:19.305 --> 00:59:20.556
Queen Mother.

788
00:59:22.391 --> 00:59:24.685
Everything is a lesson here for the children.

789
00:59:24.852 --> 00:59:27.855
They painted the walls, they feed the fish...

790
00:59:28.022 --> 00:59:30.316
and they grow everything we eat here.

791
00:59:30.483 --> 00:59:33.110
I recognize some of the concepts here.

792
00:59:33.277 --> 00:59:35.237
But you are using different material.

793
00:59:35.404 --> 00:59:38.741
Yes, we use strictly
what we can find here in Haiti.

794
00:59:40.743 --> 00:59:44.080
You were missed at T'Challa's funeral.

795
00:59:55.841 --> 00:59:57.051
Queen Mother.

796
00:59:57.218 --> 01:00:00.179
It's been six years since you left us.

797
01:00:00.346 --> 01:00:03.516
I thought you would at least come back
for the ceremony.

798
01:00:06.268 --> 01:00:08.562
I was afraid...

799
01:00:08.729 --> 01:00:12.441
of how final the funeral would be.

800
01:00:12.608 --> 01:00:15.569
Nakia, daughter of Yaa...

801
01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:20.825
wherever you go,
you are still Wakandan...

802
01:00:20.991 --> 01:00:24.620
and you know death is not the end.

803
01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:31.001
Thank you.

804
01:00:35.756 --> 01:00:37.508
How is everyone at home?

805
01:00:37.675 --> 01:00:40.010
Shuri has been taken.

806
01:00:40.719 --> 01:00:41.720
What?

807
01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:45.141
You have infiltrated many nations before.

808
01:00:45.558 --> 01:00:47.476
That was a long time ago.

809
01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:48.811
I was a different person then.

810
01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:52.022
I need someone who can find
where she is being held...

811
01:00:52.189 --> 01:00:55.234
and rescue her, without being seen.

812
01:00:55.609 --> 01:00:58.445
Who on earth would risk war with Wakanda?

813
01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:01.824
Oh, my God.

814
01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:03.284
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

815
01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:04.827
Don't tell me to breathe.

816
01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:05.995
Where the hell are we?

817
01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:08.205
We're in a cave. I'm not sure where.

818
01:01:08.372 --> 01:01:09.373
Oh, my God!

819
01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:11.500
What is that?

820
01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:14.461
Glow worms. Their larva gives off light.

821
01:01:15.421 --> 01:01:16.422
Just calm down.

822
01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:18.716
Okay, is there, like, a new Black Panther...

823
01:01:18.883 --> 01:01:21.051
-that you can call to come and get us?
-No.

824
01:01:21.218 --> 01:01:22.219
Why not?

825
01:01:22.386 --> 01:01:24.096
Because it doesn't work like that anymore.

826
01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:26.432
The Black Panther is gone.

827
01:01:27.099 --> 01:01:29.268
So y'all stopped having Black Panthers
when I get kidnapped?

828
01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:35.733
Princess.

829
01:01:36.942 --> 01:01:39.069
Here royalty wears traditional clothing.

830
01:01:39.486 --> 01:01:41.655
We had this made for you.

831
01:01:42.364 --> 01:01:44.533
Do you understand her?

832
01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.202
Not completely.

833
01:01:48.287 --> 01:01:49.496
Nuh-uh.

834
01:01:49.663 --> 01:01:51.999
That is some supervillain shit right there.

835
01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:53.500
That's in every movie.

836
01:01:53.667 --> 01:01:54.919
Princess Leia.

837
01:01:55.085 --> 01:01:56.337
Belle from <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

838
01:01:56.503 --> 01:01:59.048
That white chick from <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

839
01:01:59.173 --> 01:02:00.174
It's fine.

840
01:02:00.341 --> 01:02:02.885
You should see what I have to wear
at Warrior Falls.

841
01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:10.309
Come with me.

842
01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:12.645
Wait.

843
01:02:12.811 --> 01:02:15.272
You're not leaving me in here, are you?

844
01:02:15.439 --> 01:02:16.815
I'm coming back.

845
01:02:17.483 --> 01:02:18.692
I'm coming back.

846
01:02:18.859 --> 01:02:20.778
Stay calm.

847
01:02:27.826 --> 01:02:28.827
Eat?

848
01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:45.052
Hello Ma'am. It's nice to meet you.

849
01:02:45.219 --> 01:02:46.262
What can I help you with?

850
01:02:47.638 --> 01:02:50.349
My name is Maria Aldana.
I'm a student from Merida...

851
01:02:50.683 --> 01:02:52.393
I'm not interested. Go away. Please.

852
01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:56.563
Yes, of course. I don't mean to bother you.
Just give me a second...

853
01:02:57.022 --> 01:02:59.024
My professor mentioned a study

854
01:02:59.191 --> 01:03:03.737
where you told researchers that
you encountered something...

855
01:03:04.571 --> 01:03:06.824
Someone unimaginable.

856
01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.244
Nothing good came of speaking
with those outsiders.

857
01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:11.829
I'm begging you.

858
01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:13.163
Leave. Now.

859
01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:16.959
I've encountered him too.

860
01:03:28.512 --> 01:03:32.433
Sometimes we would catch a
glimpse of a man with winged feet...

861
01:03:33.684 --> 01:03:35.352
...on the shore of the beach.

862
01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:37.980
We thought he was a spirit.

863
01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:40.399
The K'uk'ulkan.

864
01:03:40.899 --> 01:03:43.360
Our Feathered Serpent God,

865
01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:47.114
...of this realm and the realm below.

866
01:03:47.948 --> 01:03:50.617
I would very much like to visit that beach.

867
01:03:51.368 --> 01:03:52.369
Be warned...

868
01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:58.917
K'uk'ulkan has been here for
much longer than you and I.

869
01:03:59.251 --> 01:04:01.337
Others who have searched for him

870
01:04:01.587 --> 01:04:03.213
with ill in their hearts...

871
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:04.631
have never returned.

872
01:04:05.883 --> 01:04:07.343
Lost to the depths...

873
01:04:08.802 --> 01:04:10.763
forever...

874
01:04:29.823 --> 01:04:31.450
Princess.

875
01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:32.618
Welcome.

876
01:04:34.578 --> 01:04:37.039
Please, feel free.

877
01:04:44.296 --> 01:04:45.589
This is beautiful.

878
01:04:46.423 --> 01:04:48.175
That was my mother's.

879
01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.771
These are all Mesoamerican artifacts.

880
01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:04.108
Most likely 16th century.

881
01:05:05.317 --> 01:05:07.528
Have you been alive since then?

882
01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:11.031
Your mother was human.

883
01:05:12.491 --> 01:05:13.492
She was.

884
01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:15.869
Then she became something else.

885
01:05:16.036 --> 01:05:18.080
-How?
-"How?"

886
01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:21.125
"How" is never as important as "why."

887
01:05:32.386 --> 01:05:35.514
<i>My mother and her village
were driven from their farms...</i>

888
01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:39.435
by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox...

889
01:05:39.601 --> 01:05:42.479
a hateful language,
and dogma from another world.

890
01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.983
Facing starvation...

891
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:47.985
war, and disease...

892
01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:50.237
my people turned to Chaac...

893
01:05:51.905 --> 01:05:53.782
our god of rain and abundance.

894
01:05:55.993 --> 01:05:58.871
<i>Chaac gave our shaman a vision...</i>

895
01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:02.040
<i>a way to save his people.</i>

896
01:06:05.586 --> 01:06:09.965
<i>Chaac led him to a plant
sprouting from a blue rock.</i>

897
01:06:23.437 --> 01:06:25.647
<i>My mother was pregnant with me
at the time...</i>

898
01:06:25.814 --> 01:06:28.066
and she did not want to
ingest the plant...

899
01:06:28.233 --> 01:06:30.444
for fear of what it may do to me.

900
01:06:30.944 --> 01:06:32.112
No. My baby.

901
01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:34.490
But the Shaman was convincing.

902
01:06:43.081 --> 01:06:45.000
Your baby is sick.

903
01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:47.294
Only this can heal him.

904
01:06:47.794 --> 01:06:51.423
Your baby will be the first to be born
in our new home.

905
01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:54.259
Take this gift as a promise...

906
01:06:54.426 --> 01:06:57.930
He will be our new king.

907
01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:08.190
<i>They all fell sick.</i>

908
01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:11.193
<i>And their lives...</i>

909
01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.487
<i>their existence there...</i>

910
01:07:13.654 --> 01:07:14.947
<i>ended.</i>

911
01:07:26.833 --> 01:07:29.086
<i>The plant took away their ability
to breathe air...</i>

912
01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:33.048
but enabled them to draw oxygen from the sea.

913
01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:38.136
<i>They settled in the ocean...</i>

914
01:07:38.804 --> 01:07:41.932
away from war and diseases.

915
01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:45.602
Let's go!

916
01:08:11.086 --> 01:08:13.255
My mother gave birth to me there...

917
01:08:13.547 --> 01:08:16.800
<i>and I became the firstborn son of Talokan.</i>

918
01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:19.344
<i>The plant gave me wings on my ankles...</i>

919
01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:21.930
<i>and ears that pointed to the clouds.</i>

920
01:08:22.389 --> 01:08:23.640
I was a mutant.

921
01:08:24.558 --> 01:08:27.811
I could swim in the sky and age slower.

922
01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:30.480
Breathe the air our ancestors breathed.

923
01:08:31.732 --> 01:08:33.317
<i>As she grew older...</i>

924
01:08:34.651 --> 01:08:38.238
<i>my mother mourned the life on land
that she once knew...</i>

925
01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:41.908
and died with a broken heart.

926
01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:48.624
She made me promise to bury her
in the soil of her homeland.

927
01:08:53.754 --> 01:08:57.090
Nothing could prepare me
for what I found there.

928
01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:04.931
Whose child is this?

929
01:09:20.572 --> 01:09:21.573
Shoot!

930
01:09:22.032 --> 01:09:23.033
Fire!

931
01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:40.801
Thou art a demon.

932
01:09:41.593 --> 01:09:42.844
Son of Satan.

933
01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:45.013
A Spanish man of faith cursed me.

934
01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.057
As he died by my hand...

935
01:09:47.224 --> 01:09:48.266
<i>he called me...</i>

936
01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:49.643
Thou art a child without love.

937
01:09:50.477 --> 01:09:51.645
The child without love.

938
01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.899
The child without love.

939
01:09:56.441 --> 01:09:57.901
And I took my name from there.

940
01:10:03.281 --> 01:10:04.991
<i>"Namor."</i>

941
01:10:05.158 --> 01:10:07.994
<i>Because I have no love for the surface world.</i>

942
01:10:09.996 --> 01:10:12.082
Why are you telling me all of this?

943
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.628
So that you can understand why
I have to kill the scientist.

944
01:10:16.795 --> 01:10:18.380
What if we took her to Wakanda?

945
01:10:19.756 --> 01:10:20.966
Let us go.

946
01:10:21.925 --> 01:10:23.385
I give you my word.

947
01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.011
She will remain in my country.

948
01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.680
I cannot risk that, Princess.

949
01:10:26.847 --> 01:10:28.473
Then keep me instead.

950
01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:32.060
I'd love to see your nation.

951
01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:36.022
Well, you can't go down there in that.

952
01:10:38.066 --> 01:10:41.528
Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.

953
01:10:41.695 --> 01:10:43.947
Your blood will become toxic...

954
01:10:44.114 --> 01:10:47.951
and the pressure of the ocean
will break every bone in your body.

955
01:10:51.037 --> 01:10:52.289
Or you can wear a suit.

956
01:10:52.706 --> 01:10:54.458
We have some of them. Come on.

957
01:10:57.544 --> 01:10:58.545
Stay close.

958
01:12:02.901 --> 01:12:04.569
<i>Hey! Namor, wait!</i>

959
01:14:08.151 --> 01:14:09.611
<i>Hello.</i>

960
01:14:38.181 --> 01:14:39.307
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

961
01:14:41.142 --> 01:14:42.477
<i>It's made of vibranium.</i>

962
01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:43.645
Yes.

963
01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:45.313
In the depths of the ocean...

964
01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:47.983
I brought the sun to my people.

965
01:14:50.068 --> 01:14:53.530
I know you wished me
to spare the life of the scientist.

966
01:14:53.905 --> 01:14:56.157
But now you see what I have to protect.

967
01:15:20.974 --> 01:15:23.059
<i>Nakia, your hunch was correct.</i>

968
01:15:23.226 --> 01:15:26.229
<i>I have picked up a location
on Shuri's Kimoyo earrings.</i>

969
01:15:59.596 --> 01:16:02.223
<i>The signal is coming
from an underwater cavern...</i>

970
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:05.852
<i>approximately 140 meters below the surface.</i>

971
01:16:06.478 --> 01:16:08.772
Queen Mother, I've found her signal.

972
01:16:08.938 --> 01:16:11.941
It's coming from an underwater cave.

973
01:16:12.108 --> 01:16:14.778
If she's down there,
I'm sure I'll encounter resistance.

974
01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:18.406
<i>How would you like me to proceed?</i>

975
01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:22.952
Retrieve the princess by any means necessary.

976
01:16:23.119 --> 01:16:26.331
I will attempt to draw Namor out.

977
01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:04.494
You are the first person from the surface
to come to Talokan.

978
01:17:05.495 --> 01:17:07.539
Please take this as a token of our gratitude.

979
01:17:14.712 --> 01:17:17.298
It was made with the plant
that saved Talokan.

980
01:17:20.093 --> 01:17:21.469
You are young, Princess.

981
01:17:22.345 --> 01:17:25.265
When you age as I do, you realize...

982
01:17:25.431 --> 01:17:28.184
we all lose everyone we love.

983
01:17:28.351 --> 01:17:29.936
But when I lost my brother...

984
01:17:30.103 --> 01:17:31.729
it just felt different.

985
01:17:31.896 --> 01:17:33.565
He suffered in silence.

986
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:37.152
When he finally asked me to help him,
I couldn't.

987
01:17:38.236 --> 01:17:40.738
How does that make sense...

988
01:17:40.905 --> 01:17:44.576
that the ancestors would give me
gifts and skills...

989
01:17:44.742 --> 01:17:47.495
to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?

990
01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:49.998
Why?

991
01:17:52.458 --> 01:17:54.961
I don't have an answer for that question.

992
01:17:57.088 --> 01:17:59.632
My ancestors would often say...

993
01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:03.428
"Only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

994
01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:09.350
I admire what you have built here.

995
01:18:11.644 --> 01:18:14.105
And how you've protected your people.

996
01:18:14.898 --> 01:18:17.942
But as princess of Wakanda...

997
01:18:18.109 --> 01:18:20.570
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

998
01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.366
My nation will not rest until I'm returned.

999
01:18:26.784 --> 01:18:28.912
I'm not leaving without her.

1000
01:18:29.662 --> 01:18:33.374
We need to find
a peaceful way to resolve this.

1001
01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:38.755
It is no longer about the scientist.

1002
01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:45.345
For centuries, the surface nations
have conquered and enslaved people like us.

1003
01:18:46.012 --> 01:18:47.472
Over resources.

1004
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:51.142
Since the day I buried my mother...

1005
01:18:51.309 --> 01:18:55.146
I have prepared my people
for the time they will come for us.

1006
01:18:55.313 --> 01:18:59.525
And that machine
is the sign that the time is now.

1007
01:19:01.402 --> 01:19:06.741
I need to know if Wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

1008
01:19:07.158 --> 01:19:09.035
There is no in-between.

1009
01:19:11.162 --> 01:19:14.874
So you plan to wage war
on the entire world...

1010
01:19:15.458 --> 01:19:17.794
and you want Wakanda to help you?

1011
01:19:18.711 --> 01:19:19.879
That's madness.

1012
01:19:20.046 --> 01:19:24.676
There isn't a nation that wouldn't
plunder Wakanda if given a chance.

1013
01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:27.929
If we make an alliance...

1014
01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:30.807
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

1015
01:19:31.349 --> 01:19:35.603
Then, when the threat of these nations
has been eliminated...

1016
01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:38.398
the scientist will be returned to Wakanda.

1017
01:19:38.815 --> 01:19:41.609
And if Wakanda does not accept, what then?

1018
01:19:42.694 --> 01:19:44.654
The scientist will die.

1019
01:19:45.655 --> 01:19:48.574
And Wakanda will be the first nation to fall.

1020
01:19:48.825 --> 01:19:50.368
An attack on my people?

1021
01:19:50.702 --> 01:19:52.161
Yes.

1022
01:19:52.328 --> 01:19:54.706
And I want you to listen to me.

1023
01:19:54.872 --> 01:19:58.751
Wakanda cannot win a war with Talokan.

1024
01:20:01.921 --> 01:20:04.048
You have been summoned...

1025
01:20:04.215 --> 01:20:05.425
K'uk'ulkan.

1026
01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:13.975
I heard you that night,
with your mother at the river.

1027
01:20:15.268 --> 01:20:18.021
You said you wanted to burn the world.

1028
01:20:24.193 --> 01:20:26.529
Let us burn it together.

1029
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:37.415
Queen Ramonda won't sell us any vibranium.

1030
01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:40.877
And now they abducted a young woman
who built the machine.

1031
01:20:41.044 --> 01:20:44.005
Yeah, with all due respect,
Riri Williams is a child prodigy...

1032
01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.341
who was running circles around
all of her professors.

1033
01:20:46.507 --> 01:20:49.385
The Wakandans were recruiting her
as part of their outreach program.

1034
01:20:49.552 --> 01:20:50.970
Nothing more. And then...

1035
01:20:51.137 --> 01:20:53.514
you guys send in a SWAT team
under cover of night...

1036
01:20:53.681 --> 01:20:57.101
to arrest the Crown Princess
of an international superpower.

1037
01:21:00.271 --> 01:21:03.107
The President wants to
take offensive action against Wakanda.

1038
01:21:04.484 --> 01:21:06.361
What type of offensive action?

1039
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:08.613
Destabilization.

1040
01:21:09.781 --> 01:21:13.117
Well, Special Officer Ross is our expert.

1041
01:21:13.284 --> 01:21:15.495
So, Ross, what do you think?

1042
01:21:15.661 --> 01:21:18.456
My sources are telling me
that there's someone else out there.

1043
01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:21.209
-Another nation?
-Could be. I don't know.

1044
01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:23.503
You've gotta give me enough time
to investigate this properly...

1045
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:25.755
otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war...

1046
01:21:25.922 --> 01:21:27.673
with a country whose military capacity...

1047
01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.801
we can't even comprehend.

1048
01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.387
Director?

1049
01:21:32.845 --> 01:21:35.098
I think he's the expert.

1050
01:21:35.264 --> 01:21:38.184
I think it would be a mistake
to attack Wakanda.

1051
01:21:44.816 --> 01:21:45.817
<i>Yes?</i>

1052
01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:46.901
We have a problem.

1053
01:22:08.631 --> 01:22:10.967
Is my daughter alive?

1054
01:22:11.134 --> 01:22:13.094
The princess is alive and well.

1055
01:22:13.803 --> 01:22:16.639
She requested to be taken to Talokan.

1056
01:22:16.806 --> 01:22:19.183
She will remain there for the time being.

1057
01:22:22.812 --> 01:22:26.065
What can I offer you in exchange?

1058
01:22:26.482 --> 01:22:27.483
Nothing.

1059
01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:29.652
I beg to differ.

1060
01:22:29.819 --> 01:22:33.197
The Americans are preparing
to blame Wakanda...

1061
01:22:33.364 --> 01:22:36.117
for your attack on their mining ship.

1062
01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:39.245
Return my daughter and the scientist...

1063
01:22:39.412 --> 01:22:42.999
or I will inform them of your existence.

1064
01:22:49.714 --> 01:22:51.841
If you tell the Americans about us...

1065
01:22:53.342 --> 01:22:55.511
if you try to find us...

1066
01:22:56.596 --> 01:23:00.391
or if I discover
a single Wakandan ship in the ocean...

1067
01:23:01.184 --> 01:23:02.643
I will kill the princess.

1068
01:23:04.187 --> 01:23:05.980
I will come to Wakanda...

1069
01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:08.107
and I will kill you.

1070
01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:18.493
So, what happened?

1071
01:23:20.369 --> 01:23:23.372
He wants to go to war
with the surface world...

1072
01:23:23.539 --> 01:23:25.333
and asked me to help him.

1073
01:23:29.837 --> 01:23:31.964
I need to think.

1074
01:23:32.131 --> 01:23:34.091
We ain't never gettin' out of here.

1075
01:23:46.395 --> 01:23:47.688
Drop your spear!

1076
01:23:47.855 --> 01:23:49.315
Kill the Princess!

1077
01:23:55.404 --> 01:23:56.739
Drop your knife.

1078
01:23:57.156 --> 01:23:58.157
You...

1079
01:23:58.991 --> 01:24:00.117
You killed her.

1080
01:24:00.993 --> 01:24:02.286
Let her go

1081
01:24:02.495 --> 01:24:04.455
and you don't have to die.

1082
01:24:07.458 --> 01:24:08.459
Shuri...

1083
01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.045
Move your left arm.

1084
01:24:15.675 --> 01:24:16.801
Are you okay?

1085
01:24:17.593 --> 01:24:18.970
Are you okay?

1086
01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.471
-Give me your Beads!
-Let's go.

1087
01:24:20.638 --> 01:24:23.099
-Give me your Beads. I can save her.
-We have to go.

1088
01:24:23.266 --> 01:24:25.560
Shuri, I don't know who this lady is,
but we need to listen to her.

1089
01:24:25.726 --> 01:24:26.894
Listen, I hit her with a sonic round.

1090
01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:29.105
It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.

1091
01:24:29.272 --> 01:24:31.274
You don't understand. This will mean war.

1092
01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.818
-We have to go.
-Wait!

1093
01:25:17.403 --> 01:25:18.404
Did they hurt you?

1094
01:25:18.571 --> 01:25:20.114
No. No.

1095
01:25:21.657 --> 01:25:22.867
Thank you.

1096
01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:24.869
You're welcome.

1097
01:25:26.370 --> 01:25:27.496
-GRIOT.
<i>-Yes, my Queen.</i>

1098
01:25:27.663 --> 01:25:29.707
Return us to Wakanda at once.

1099
01:25:33.544 --> 01:25:35.379
What happened my child?

1100
01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:39.175
The Wakandans.

1101
01:25:39.967 --> 01:25:41.761
They came for her.

1102
01:25:44.388 --> 01:25:46.432
K'uk'ulkan...

1103
01:25:48.934 --> 01:25:52.396
can you save me?

1104
01:26:05.743 --> 01:26:07.119
Is she dead?

1105
01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:10.581
Yes.

1106
01:26:19.256 --> 01:26:21.592
Rest child.

1107
01:26:24.136 --> 01:26:25.554
They came...

1108
01:26:26.013 --> 01:26:29.975
while you spoke to the Queen?

1109
01:26:31.394 --> 01:26:34.814
We should not have trusted her.

1110
01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:38.526
The Princess has seen our home.

1111
01:26:38.984 --> 01:26:41.195
What is stopping them

1112
01:26:41.612 --> 01:26:43.739
from coming for Talokan?

1113
01:26:45.991 --> 01:26:47.284
I will.

1114
01:27:22.153 --> 01:27:23.612
Rise Talokan!

1115
01:27:26.115 --> 01:27:27.742
Rise Talokan!

1116
01:27:33.038 --> 01:27:35.082
I was blinded

1117
01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:36.625
by hope

1118
01:27:36.792 --> 01:27:38.502
of partnership.

1119
01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:41.422
And...

1120
01:27:42.047 --> 01:27:44.300
I have compromised

1121
01:27:44.884 --> 01:27:47.011
all of us.

1122
01:27:47.803 --> 01:27:48.929
Talokan

1123
01:27:49.346 --> 01:27:50.806
will not move

1124
01:27:50.973 --> 01:27:52.391
again.

1125
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:54.351
Namora.

1126
01:27:55.352 --> 01:27:56.353
Attuma.

1127
01:27:58.481 --> 01:28:01.484
When we are done with them

1128
01:28:04.403 --> 01:28:06.739
they will never think

1129
01:28:06.906 --> 01:28:08.949
of approaching

1130
01:28:09.116 --> 01:28:10.576
Talokan!

1131
01:28:12.953 --> 01:28:14.288
Rise Talokan!

1132
01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:29.053
Princess, it is good to have you back.

1133
01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.388
The city has been on edge since you left.

1134
01:28:32.306 --> 01:28:33.307
Go.

1135
01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:36.060
Fortify the sonic barriers for all waterways.

1136
01:28:36.227 --> 01:28:37.228
Princess?

1137
01:28:38.145 --> 01:28:39.146
Neka.

1138
01:28:41.106 --> 01:28:43.484
Thank the ancestors.

1139
01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:47.029
I just wanted to return these.

1140
01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:50.407
No. Keep them.

1141
01:28:50.574 --> 01:28:52.076
Might need them soon.

1142
01:28:52.993 --> 01:28:54.995
Did you get that from down there?

1143
01:28:57.957 --> 01:29:01.335
Is it true you saw an underwater empire?

1144
01:29:02.586 --> 01:29:03.712
Yes.

1145
01:29:05.005 --> 01:29:06.590
It is beautiful.

1146
01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:10.469
But these people are dangerous, Aneka.

1147
01:29:30.656 --> 01:29:33.450
So, Miss Riri Williams...

1148
01:29:34.201 --> 01:29:36.370
what do you think of Wakanda?

1149
01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:39.456
The stories just don't do this place justice.

1150
01:29:41.667 --> 01:29:42.710
It's great.

1151
01:29:42.877 --> 01:29:44.628
But I really would like to go home.

1152
01:29:46.088 --> 01:29:47.673
You will need to be patient.

1153
01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:49.884
Can I at least call my mom?

1154
01:29:56.307 --> 01:29:59.602
The Princess has been brought home
by the War Dog Nakia.

1155
01:29:59.768 --> 01:30:01.145
Glory to Hanuman.

1156
01:30:01.312 --> 01:30:02.688
Glory to Hanuman.

1157
01:30:03.856 --> 01:30:07.318
The spy saves Wakanda once again.

1158
01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:09.361
The Queen will reward her...

1159
01:30:09.528 --> 01:30:12.031
with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.

1160
01:30:14.491 --> 01:30:15.951
Okoye.

1161
01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:19.413
Thank you, my sister.

1162
01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:22.833
<i>After Thanos' attack...</i>

1163
01:30:23.292 --> 01:30:25.419
when you left without saying a word...

1164
01:30:26.045 --> 01:30:27.212
it hurt.

1165
01:30:31.175 --> 01:30:34.595
I regret not being there with all of you.

1166
01:30:36.096 --> 01:30:37.389
It was not easy.

1167
01:30:38.182 --> 01:30:39.183
He was...

1168
01:30:39.850 --> 01:30:43.687
King and Black Panther to everyone.

1169
01:30:44.355 --> 01:30:45.940
But to me...

1170
01:30:52.279 --> 01:30:53.989
he was everything.

1171
01:30:55.866 --> 01:30:57.826
My T'Challa.

1172
01:30:59.161 --> 01:31:02.122
When he was taken away from me,
just like that, I...

1173
01:31:02.873 --> 01:31:04.750
I had to step away...

1174
01:31:05.668 --> 01:31:07.294
and let myself break.

1175
01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:11.966
I couldn't just...

1176
01:31:12.132 --> 01:31:15.511
keep going as if nothing had happened,
you know.

1177
01:31:33.362 --> 01:31:34.363
We are under attack.

1178
01:31:42.037 --> 01:31:43.038
Here.

1179
01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:51.005
Take this one.

1180
01:31:51.964 --> 01:31:53.549
Are you okay? Are you all right?

1181
01:31:53.716 --> 01:31:55.592
GRIOT, activate the Sunbird.

1182
01:31:55.759 --> 01:31:56.927
Shuri, where are you?

1183
01:31:57.094 --> 01:31:58.554
Making my way to the city right now.

1184
01:31:58.721 --> 01:32:00.180
Stand down! That is an order!

1185
01:32:00.347 --> 01:32:02.641
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

1186
01:32:02.808 --> 01:32:05.394
<i>-Aneka, do not let her leave the lab.</i>
-Mother, you're breaking up.

1187
01:32:05.477 --> 01:32:06.478
-We can't hear you.
<i>-Shuri!</i>

1188
01:32:06.562 --> 01:32:07.563
Love you. Bye!

1189
01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:10.941
You just hung up on the Queen.

1190
01:32:11.108 --> 01:32:12.109
I just hung up on my mom.

1191
01:32:12.276 --> 01:32:13.861
There's a difference. Come. Let's go!

1192
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:48.187
Invaders!

1193
01:32:53.776 --> 01:32:56.987
Mama! Mama!

1194
01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:01.450
Let us turn! Turn around!

1195
01:33:05.412 --> 01:33:08.332
<i>EMTs are suffering a form of sonic hypnosis.</i>

1196
01:33:11.001 --> 01:33:12.127
Take the child.

1197
01:33:12.294 --> 01:33:14.129
<i>General, plug your ears.</i>

1198
01:33:14.296 --> 01:33:15.380
Yes, my Queen.

1199
01:34:01.552 --> 01:34:02.553
Can I help?

1200
01:34:02.719 --> 01:34:03.929
Come, quickly.

1201
01:34:10.853 --> 01:34:12.396
Warrior!

1202
01:34:14.314 --> 01:34:15.315
Cross your arms...

1203
01:34:15.399 --> 01:34:16.400
...my child.

1204
01:34:21.196 --> 01:34:22.197
Nakia.

1205
01:34:22.281 --> 01:34:23.282
Yes.

1206
01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:24.741
We'll find your mama, OK?

1207
01:34:36.753 --> 01:34:38.046
The fish man.

1208
01:34:42.342 --> 01:34:45.012
The defenses have been lured
away from the palace.

1209
01:34:45.304 --> 01:34:47.347
It is up to you now.

1210
01:36:06.093 --> 01:36:07.094
Mayday!

1211
01:36:07.552 --> 01:36:08.553
Mayday!

1212
01:36:26.405 --> 01:36:28.365
-Shit, he's too fast.
-He's even faster in the water.

1213
01:36:54.433 --> 01:36:55.851
-Activating system override.
-No.

1214
01:36:56.018 --> 01:36:58.020
-Wait! I'll fix it.
-Can't leave you here, Shuri!

1215
01:37:15.412 --> 01:37:16.413
Do you see her?

1216
01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:17.998
Yes. Right there.

1217
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:32.471
Go, child.

1218
01:37:33.930 --> 01:37:35.390
Wait, what? And leave you here?

1219
01:37:35.557 --> 01:37:36.600
Run!

1220
01:37:51.239 --> 01:37:52.699
Okoye, move now!

1221
01:38:53.385 --> 01:38:54.386
Help the child.

1222
01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:01.518
She did this.

1223
01:39:05.564 --> 01:39:09.484
In one week's time,
I will return with my entire army...

1224
01:39:09.651 --> 01:39:12.904
and you will join us
against the surface world...

1225
01:39:13.071 --> 01:39:16.032
or I will wash Wakanda
from the face of the Earth.

1226
01:39:16.825 --> 01:39:17.826
Come on, my Queen.

1227
01:39:18.994 --> 01:39:19.995
Mother.

1228
01:39:20.454 --> 01:39:22.164
-Keep her back!
-Mother!

1229
01:39:22.497 --> 01:39:25.208
-Mama! Mama!
-Bury your dead.

1230
01:39:25.959 --> 01:39:27.544
Mourn your losses.

1231
01:39:30.839 --> 01:39:32.424
You are queen now.

1232
01:39:32.674 --> 01:39:33.675
Mother!

1233
01:39:34.384 --> 01:39:35.385
No!

1234
01:39:38.555 --> 01:39:40.098
Get off of me!
Mother!

1235
01:39:40.849 --> 01:39:42.726
Mama!

1236
01:39:49.566 --> 01:39:51.067
Mama!

1237
01:39:51.693 --> 01:39:53.111
Mama!

1238
01:39:53.695 --> 01:39:54.863
Mother!

1239
01:39:55.447 --> 01:39:56.448
Wake up, my Queen.

1240
01:39:58.617 --> 01:39:59.743
Let me see.

1241
01:40:00.368 --> 01:40:01.369
Wake up.

1242
01:40:02.412 --> 01:40:03.747
Help me!

1243
01:40:03.914 --> 01:40:05.207
Mama!

1244
01:40:08.710 --> 01:40:09.878
Wake up, Mother.

1245
01:40:10.545 --> 01:40:11.755
She has passed.

1246
01:40:12.714 --> 01:40:14.132
Mama!

1247
01:40:55.549 --> 01:41:00.720
Jabariland offers you their comfort
for your loss.

1248
01:41:07.352 --> 01:41:09.020
You must mourn her...

1249
01:41:09.187 --> 01:41:13.108
in accordance to the rituals
of your ancestors.

1250
01:41:15.068 --> 01:41:16.903
Do not bury yourself in your technology.

1251
01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:18.321
Why are you here?

1252
01:41:20.198 --> 01:41:21.908
I promised your brother...

1253
01:41:22.075 --> 01:41:24.369
that I would provide you with counsel...

1254
01:41:24.536 --> 01:41:25.954
and protection.

1255
01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:30.625
But I am in need of your advice today.

1256
01:41:34.462 --> 01:41:38.091
Your tribal elders have approached me
with a proposition.

1257
01:41:39.509 --> 01:41:42.762
They wish to evacuate the city
and set up camp...

1258
01:41:42.929 --> 01:41:44.431
in Jabariland.

1259
01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:47.767
So, now you are keen
to hear from a child...

1260
01:41:48.435 --> 01:41:50.103
who scoffs at tradition?

1261
01:41:54.316 --> 01:41:55.317
The world...

1262
01:41:57.235 --> 01:41:59.904
The world has taken too much from you...

1263
01:42:00.655 --> 01:42:03.908
for you to still be considered a child.

1264
01:42:07.037 --> 01:42:08.913
It is in my people's interest to know...

1265
01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.499
which way your mind is leaning.

1266
01:42:13.376 --> 01:42:15.086
The elders are desperate.

1267
01:42:16.713 --> 01:42:18.632
The city is vulnerable.

1268
01:42:20.842 --> 01:42:23.011
If you are to provide for them...

1269
01:42:24.137 --> 01:42:26.389
they will be in great debt to you.

1270
01:42:28.475 --> 01:42:30.185
And what of your heart?

1271
01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:35.732
Which way is your heart leaning?

1272
01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:40.570
I just buried the last person
who truly knew me.

1273
01:42:44.074 --> 01:42:45.742
My heart was buried with her.

1274
01:43:22.737 --> 01:43:23.738
Oh, man.

1275
01:43:24.614 --> 01:43:26.533
Yeah, your olive oil's about to go bad.

1276
01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:27.701
What are you doing here?

1277
01:43:27.867 --> 01:43:30.537
I'm hungry. And...

1278
01:43:30.954 --> 01:43:32.956
<i>Tragedy strikes the international community.</i>

1279
01:43:33.123 --> 01:43:37.252
<i>Sources can now confirm that Queen Ramonda,
daughter of Lumumba, has died.</i>

1280
01:43:37.877 --> 01:43:41.589
<i>Western allies say that civil conflict
was the likely cause of the Queen's...</i>

1281
01:43:44.134 --> 01:43:45.135
So...

1282
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:46.845
You have any comment?

1283
01:43:49.013 --> 01:43:52.183
I wonder what else your friends
are keeping from you.

1284
01:43:52.851 --> 01:43:54.018
What are you talking about?

1285
01:43:54.185 --> 01:43:57.731
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the kingdom of Wakanda.

1286
01:44:00.108 --> 01:44:02.277
What about the Beads?

1287
01:44:03.445 --> 01:44:04.571
What?

1288
01:44:04.738 --> 01:44:05.739
The Beads.

1289
01:44:05.905 --> 01:44:07.031
I had them bugged...

1290
01:44:07.198 --> 01:44:08.867
before you ever even got there.

1291
01:44:09.033 --> 01:44:12.871
I've been privy to
every conversation you've had...

1292
01:44:13.037 --> 01:44:15.623
including that treasonous call
with the Queen.

1293
01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:17.167
May she rest in peace.

1294
01:44:17.584 --> 01:44:18.877
But it's good.

1295
01:44:19.043 --> 01:44:20.086
Well, for us.

1296
01:44:20.253 --> 01:44:22.964
All right. You know what?
The Wakandans saved my life.

1297
01:44:23.465 --> 01:44:24.549
They're a good people.

1298
01:44:25.175 --> 01:44:27.218
You ever thought for a second...

1299
01:44:27.385 --> 01:44:29.012
what they could be doing?

1300
01:44:29.179 --> 01:44:30.513
Ever thought what we would be doing...

1301
01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:33.892
if the US was the only country in the world
with vibranium?

1302
01:44:35.185 --> 01:44:38.438
I actually dream about that.

1303
01:44:41.274 --> 01:44:42.942
Val. Val, please.

1304
01:44:43.318 --> 01:44:44.903
It's Director de Fontaine.

1305
01:44:47.822 --> 01:44:50.992
Your mother protected me
like I was one of her own.

1306
01:44:52.285 --> 01:44:54.746
The least that I could do
is try to return the favor.

1307
01:44:57.081 --> 01:44:59.459
We need to find a way to weaken Namor.

1308
01:44:59.626 --> 01:45:01.795
Even weakened,
he's still gonna be a problem.

1309
01:45:01.961 --> 01:45:05.381
The Black Panther has never
failed to protect Wakanda.

1310
01:45:06.132 --> 01:45:08.134
I thought the Black Panther was gone.

1311
01:45:17.852 --> 01:45:19.187
My brother is dead.

1312
01:45:20.939 --> 01:45:23.525
But it doesn't mean
the Black Panther is gone.

1313
01:45:41.292 --> 01:45:42.836
GRIOT?

1314
01:45:43.002 --> 01:45:45.630
Let's start by running
a comparative analysis...

1315
01:45:45.797 --> 01:45:49.384
between our attempts at creating
a synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

1316
01:45:52.095 --> 01:45:54.055
and the fibers from this bracelet.

1317
01:45:54.639 --> 01:45:55.932
<i>Yes, Princess.</i>

1318
01:45:59.227 --> 01:46:01.980
Since this was grown
from vibranium-rich soil...

1319
01:46:03.231 --> 01:46:06.693
they may share some base-level similarities
that we can exploit.

1320
01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:08.152
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

1321
01:46:12.448 --> 01:46:14.868
Please upload my brother's DNA also.

1322
01:46:15.034 --> 01:46:16.160
<i>Uploading now.</i>

1323
01:46:47.734 --> 01:46:49.068
Why doesn't he look like them?

1324
01:46:49.235 --> 01:46:51.446
His physiology is completely different.

1325
01:46:51.613 --> 01:46:54.282
None of them fly
or have pointed ears like him.

1326
01:46:54.782 --> 01:46:56.784
The women that were guarding us,
they had water over their mouths...

1327
01:46:56.951 --> 01:46:58.661
and on their necks.

1328
01:46:58.745 --> 01:46:59.746
He didn't have that.

1329
01:46:59.913 --> 01:47:05.335
Several organisms don't need gills
to extract oxygen from the water, so...

1330
01:47:05.501 --> 01:47:07.045
It's like a jellyfish.

1331
01:47:07.211 --> 01:47:11.007
He just absorbs the oxygen
from his skin.

1332
01:47:12.425 --> 01:47:14.636
-It's a process called diffusion.
-Diffusion.

1333
01:47:38.952 --> 01:47:41.746
Every day that passes
without selecting the ruler...

1334
01:47:41.913 --> 01:47:43.289
is a day wasted.

1335
01:47:43.456 --> 01:47:46.876
We must deal with Namor
before he brings his warriors back here.

1336
01:47:47.043 --> 01:47:49.712
And how are we to deal with a man
with that much power?

1337
01:47:50.588 --> 01:47:52.298
In that attack,
before he took out your plane...

1338
01:47:52.465 --> 01:47:53.716
he jumped back into the water.

1339
01:47:53.883 --> 01:47:55.635
What if that's what makes him strong?

1340
01:47:55.802 --> 01:47:59.347
He's breathing air and getting oxygen
from the water on his skin.

1341
01:47:59.514 --> 01:48:02.767
If we could find a way to dry his ass out,
he won't be as strong.

1342
01:48:03.101 --> 01:48:04.268
Yo, that's it.

1343
01:48:04.394 --> 01:48:05.395
GRIOT.

1344
01:48:05.561 --> 01:48:09.273
We need to convert the Royal Talon Fighter
into a pervaporation chamber.

1345
01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.525
Is that even possible?

1346
01:48:10.692 --> 01:48:11.859
Yes.

1347
01:48:13.361 --> 01:48:15.279
You're going to help us trap him.

1348
01:48:16.114 --> 01:48:18.116
Please show Miss Williams
where she's working.

1349
01:48:18.282 --> 01:48:19.826
Right this way.

1350
01:48:23.705 --> 01:48:26.165
<i>How old were you
when you built your first machine?</i>

1351
01:48:26.332 --> 01:48:27.417
<i>Three.</i>

1352
01:48:27.583 --> 01:48:31.045
<i>My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes.</i>

1353
01:48:31.212 --> 01:48:33.673
<i>He gave me these tools
and let me just work it out.</i>

1354
01:48:37.593 --> 01:48:39.887
<i>So who taught you how to do
all that you do?</i>

1355
01:48:40.221 --> 01:48:41.472
<i>My big brother.</i>

1356
01:48:44.517 --> 01:48:47.854
I was the tip of the spear
of Wakanda's army.

1357
01:48:48.021 --> 01:48:50.440
This is not me.

1358
01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:53.109
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1359
01:48:54.193 --> 01:48:55.570
I turned in my weapon.

1360
01:48:56.195 --> 01:48:57.864
I built you a new spear as well.

1361
01:48:59.741 --> 01:49:00.742
A new one?

1362
01:49:00.908 --> 01:49:01.951
Yes.

1363
01:49:03.286 --> 01:49:05.663
What is this contraption's name anyway?

1364
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:07.290
The Midnight Angel.

1365
01:49:07.457 --> 01:49:08.833
Midnight Angel?

1366
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.752
Listen to me.

1367
01:49:11.836 --> 01:49:14.047
This will even the odds against them.

1368
01:49:14.213 --> 01:49:16.674
Sister, I need you to
be ready when I call you.

1369
01:49:18.509 --> 01:49:19.719
Please.

1370
01:49:24.307 --> 01:49:25.516
Shuri.

1371
01:49:26.184 --> 01:49:27.351
Yes.

1372
01:49:28.978 --> 01:49:30.563
How many of these did you make?

1373
01:49:32.690 --> 01:49:34.650
I looked for you at the Jabari outpost.

1374
01:49:34.817 --> 01:49:36.486
I won't be forced out of my home.

1375
01:49:36.652 --> 01:49:39.197
You have such a rebellious spirit.

1376
01:49:39.363 --> 01:49:40.740
Why did you join the Dora?

1377
01:49:41.783 --> 01:49:42.950
Why do you care?

1378
01:49:50.208 --> 01:49:52.710
I still have a lot of fight left in me.

1379
01:49:53.211 --> 01:49:56.339
Tell me, Aneka, daughter of Kyana...

1380
01:49:57.006 --> 01:49:59.217
do you still have some fight left in you?

1381
01:49:59.383 --> 01:50:01.803
What do you have in mind?

1382
01:50:26.452 --> 01:50:27.453
GRIOT...

1383
01:50:28.996 --> 01:50:30.456
what's the confidence rate?

1384
01:50:31.082 --> 01:50:33.376
<i>98.7%, Princess.</i>

1385
01:50:33.751 --> 01:50:37.421
<i>Would you like me to print
the Heart-Shaped Herb?</i>

1386
01:50:40.466 --> 01:50:42.969
Hey, Shuri.

1387
01:50:43.719 --> 01:50:46.013
Thought you'd be back in Haiti by now.

1388
01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:48.683
I'm still Wakandan, you know.

1389
01:50:52.728 --> 01:50:53.729
So...

1390
01:50:55.022 --> 01:50:57.984
this is what you've been up to.

1391
01:50:58.776 --> 01:50:59.944
Yes.

1392
01:51:00.111 --> 01:51:02.029
What you have here, now...

1393
01:51:03.281 --> 01:51:07.493
is a chance to restore Wakanda's protector.

1394
01:51:08.744 --> 01:51:12.999
It would be the greatest gift...

1395
01:51:13.457 --> 01:51:15.793
since Bashenga's discovery.

1396
01:51:20.923 --> 01:51:23.176
We'll soon find out. Come.

1397
01:51:26.304 --> 01:51:27.763
-GRIOT?
<i>-Yes, Princess.</i>

1398
01:51:27.930 --> 01:51:28.931
Print it.

1399
01:51:33.102 --> 01:51:34.812
How will we know if it works?

1400
01:51:35.605 --> 01:51:36.856
If it glows.

1401
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:47.158
You did it!

1402
01:51:51.996 --> 01:51:54.373
I mean, shouldn't we be burning incense
or something?

1403
01:51:54.999 --> 01:51:58.169
Only Bast knows how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.

1404
01:52:08.512 --> 01:52:10.348
Are you sure you don't want me to bury you?

1405
01:52:10.514 --> 01:52:11.515
No.

1406
01:52:12.099 --> 01:52:14.143
Need you to have access to my chest...

1407
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:16.354
just in case I go through cardiac arrest.

1408
01:52:16.938 --> 01:52:18.481
"Cardiac arrest"?

1409
01:52:19.565 --> 01:52:20.608
She's joking...

1410
01:52:21.150 --> 01:52:22.401
right?

1411
01:52:24.403 --> 01:52:25.404
Right?

1412
01:52:30.368 --> 01:52:34.205
Allow this Heart-Shaped Herb...

1413
01:52:34.580 --> 01:52:37.625
to give you the strength
of the Black Panther...

1414
01:52:38.042 --> 01:52:40.461
and take you to the Ancestral Plane.

1415
01:52:42.964 --> 01:52:44.340
Ramonda.

1416
01:52:44.715 --> 01:52:49.720
We beg of you, come to your daughter.

1417
01:53:59.749 --> 01:54:00.750
Mother?

1418
01:54:14.096 --> 01:54:15.348
N'Jadaka.

1419
01:54:15.931 --> 01:54:17.099
Lil' cousin.

1420
01:54:17.475 --> 01:54:18.476
How?

1421
01:54:18.684 --> 01:54:21.395
How is never as important as why, right?

1422
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:24.440
You chose me.

1423
01:54:24.607 --> 01:54:27.485
Impossible. I would never choose you.

1424
01:54:27.651 --> 01:54:29.320
Why did you take the Herb?

1425
01:54:30.196 --> 01:54:31.197
To see my family.

1426
01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:32.281
No, that's bullshit.

1427
01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:36.243
You didn't believe the Ancestral Plane
was real, did you?

1428
01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:40.373
No.

1429
01:54:41.123 --> 01:54:42.375
So, why did you take it, then?

1430
01:54:44.085 --> 01:54:45.461
You don't have to lie to me.

1431
01:54:46.295 --> 01:54:47.797
So I can be strong.

1432
01:54:48.172 --> 01:54:49.673
Strong to do what?

1433
01:54:52.551 --> 01:54:53.552
See?

1434
01:54:55.096 --> 01:54:57.056
We're more alike than you think.

1435
01:54:58.974 --> 01:55:00.935
I took it to avenge my ancestors too.

1436
01:55:01.102 --> 01:55:02.269
I'm nothing like you.

1437
01:55:03.729 --> 01:55:05.481
You took it for yourself...

1438
01:55:05.648 --> 01:55:07.191
then destroyed the rest.

1439
01:55:08.692 --> 01:55:09.902
Unworthy king...

1440
01:55:10.736 --> 01:55:12.238
afraid of being replaced.

1441
01:55:13.322 --> 01:55:14.323
Just a coward.

1442
01:55:14.490 --> 01:55:15.491
No.

1443
01:55:15.658 --> 01:55:18.244
I had the courage to do
what was necessary to change Wakanda.

1444
01:55:19.662 --> 01:55:21.080
How many people like your scientist...

1445
01:55:21.247 --> 01:55:23.624
did Wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

1446
01:55:24.667 --> 01:55:25.668
Cowards.

1447
01:55:25.835 --> 01:55:28.921
That was the Panthers
that came before me...

1448
01:55:29.088 --> 01:55:30.089
and before T'Challa.

1449
01:55:30.256 --> 01:55:32.091
Don't mention my brother.

1450
01:55:32.425 --> 01:55:34.093
You're the reason why he's dead.

1451
01:55:34.593 --> 01:55:37.847
You burnt the Herb,
left us with no protector.

1452
01:55:38.013 --> 01:55:40.266
Then Namor struck and killed my mother.

1453
01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:42.268
Their blood is on your hands.

1454
01:55:43.436 --> 01:55:44.770
That ain't on me.

1455
01:55:45.312 --> 01:55:46.689
And don't you dare...

1456
01:55:46.856 --> 01:55:48.691
take that away from your mother.

1457
01:55:48.858 --> 01:55:52.361
She sacrificed her life to protect
a young girl from the lost tribe.

1458
01:55:53.737 --> 01:55:56.407
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

1459
01:55:57.908 --> 01:55:59.660
He would've killed that girl.

1460
01:56:00.369 --> 01:56:02.288
Shit, he killed his own brother.

1461
01:56:03.873 --> 01:56:06.542
T'Challa was too noble.

1462
01:56:08.711 --> 01:56:11.046
He let the man who murdered your father live.

1463
01:56:13.174 --> 01:56:14.842
And here you stand.

1464
01:56:20.514 --> 01:56:22.641
Are you gonna be noble like your brother...

1465
01:56:22.808 --> 01:56:24.894
or take care of business...

1466
01:56:25.603 --> 01:56:26.729
like me?

1467
01:56:29.565 --> 01:56:30.566
Are you okay?

1468
01:56:32.735 --> 01:56:33.903
Are you OK?

1469
01:56:36.447 --> 01:56:37.531
Who did you see?

1470
01:56:43.037 --> 01:56:44.038
No one.

1471
01:56:47.291 --> 01:56:48.292
What's going on?

1472
01:56:48.918 --> 01:56:50.336
I failed.

1473
01:56:50.503 --> 01:56:51.504
It didn't work.

1474
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:52.630
Hey, Shuri.

1475
01:56:55.716 --> 01:56:56.717
They abandoned me.

1476
01:56:56.884 --> 01:56:58.052
They would never do that.

1477
01:56:58.219 --> 01:56:59.720
I did everything I was supposed to do.

1478
01:56:59.887 --> 01:57:01.180
I re-created the Herb.

1479
01:57:01.347 --> 01:57:03.807
-Okay.
-I just did your stupid ritual, and for what?

1480
01:57:03.974 --> 01:57:05.434
-Relax.
-Why didn't they come for me?

1481
01:57:05.601 --> 01:57:06.727
Just relax.

1482
01:57:13.817 --> 01:57:15.110
Shit.

1483
01:57:19.448 --> 01:57:20.783
Can I get some of that too?

1484
01:57:28.207 --> 01:57:29.250
I think...

1485
01:57:30.793 --> 01:57:32.253
you're going to need a suit.

1486
01:58:03.867 --> 01:58:05.786
There are more people coming from the city.

1487
01:58:05.953 --> 01:58:07.580
They need more space.

1488
01:58:07.746 --> 01:58:08.747
So what?

1489
01:58:09.623 --> 01:58:11.875
You are visitors.

1490
01:58:12.042 --> 01:58:15.379
It is a wonder how anything gets done
with you people.

1491
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:42.698
The princess!

1492
01:59:16.231 --> 01:59:17.524
She has done it!

1493
01:59:18.233 --> 01:59:21.278
The Black Panther lives!

1494
01:59:39.088 --> 01:59:41.507
Namor believes Wakanda is on her knees.

1495
01:59:43.967 --> 01:59:45.427
Our Queen murdered.

1496
01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:49.473
Our capital destroyed.

1497
01:59:51.141 --> 01:59:52.976
He believes we have no protector.

1498
01:59:54.978 --> 01:59:55.979
But now...

1499
01:59:57.773 --> 01:59:59.775
now is our time to strike.

1500
01:59:59.942 --> 02:00:03.529
How, when we don't even know
how to find him?

1501
02:00:04.113 --> 02:00:05.823
We'll bring Namor to us.

1502
02:00:05.989 --> 02:00:07.533
-Here, again?
-No.

1503
02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:10.035
A distant location at sea.

1504
02:00:10.119 --> 02:00:11.120
All right.

1505
02:00:11.704 --> 02:00:13.163
Let's say this does work.

1506
02:00:15.582 --> 02:00:17.209
Assuming we can kill this man...

1507
02:00:17.376 --> 02:00:20.421
who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the Hulk...

1508
02:00:23.173 --> 02:00:25.592
is murdering him the right solution?

1509
02:00:26.051 --> 02:00:28.011
You were calling for his head...

1510
02:00:28.178 --> 02:00:30.514
when his only crime was intimidation.

1511
02:00:30.681 --> 02:00:32.474
What has changed, Lord M'Baku?

1512
02:00:32.641 --> 02:00:33.851
His soldiers...

1513
02:00:34.017 --> 02:00:35.644
did not call him General or King.

1514
02:00:35.811 --> 02:00:38.480
They called him K'uk'ulkan.

1515
02:00:38.647 --> 02:00:39.857
What is that?

1516
02:00:40.023 --> 02:00:42.151
The feather serpent god.

1517
02:00:42.735 --> 02:00:43.736
What?

1518
02:00:43.902 --> 02:00:45.821
Do you think because
we are living in the mountains...

1519
02:00:45.988 --> 02:00:47.865
we do not have access to books?

1520
02:00:48.323 --> 02:00:49.616
Elders...

1521
02:00:50.033 --> 02:00:51.410
with your permission...

1522
02:00:51.577 --> 02:00:55.289
I would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku alone.

1523
02:00:56.206 --> 02:00:57.207
Yes.

1524
02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:58.584
Yes.

1525
02:01:05.424 --> 02:01:06.759
Namor's not finished.

1526
02:01:08.177 --> 02:01:11.263
He promised to destroy the surface world.

1527
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:13.766
Now is our opportunity to take him.

1528
02:01:13.932 --> 02:01:16.185
-What are you afraid of?
-War.

1529
02:01:16.602 --> 02:01:19.938
If Namor is indeed a god to his people...

1530
02:01:20.105 --> 02:01:22.733
killing him will risk eternal war.

1531
02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:23.984
And so what?

1532
02:01:24.526 --> 02:01:26.862
Was my mother's life not worth eternal war?

1533
02:01:27.029 --> 02:01:28.405
Of course it was.

1534
02:01:29.406 --> 02:01:33.494
Of course she was.

1535
02:01:35.496 --> 02:01:38.707
But it is not what she would
have wanted for you.

1536
02:01:44.171 --> 02:01:45.881
And it is not what I want...

1537
02:01:48.509 --> 02:01:50.260
for my people.

1538
02:02:00.604 --> 02:02:03.649
You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.

1539
02:02:04.566 --> 02:02:06.568
Of what she would've wanted for me.

1540
02:02:07.653 --> 02:02:09.947
Her hopes and her dreams.

1541
02:02:13.116 --> 02:02:14.618
But she's dead.

1542
02:02:15.661 --> 02:02:16.662
She's gone!

1543
02:02:18.372 --> 02:02:22.251
Namor drowned her, right in front of me!

1544
02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:24.962
So, her dreams...

1545
02:02:25.128 --> 02:02:28.215
her goals, her hopes for me...

1546
02:02:31.552 --> 02:02:32.803
it doesn't exist.

1547
02:02:35.514 --> 02:02:37.057
It doesn't matter anymore.

1548
02:02:39.142 --> 02:02:42.020
What matters is what I want...

1549
02:02:42.187 --> 02:02:44.898
and what I want is Namor dead!

1550
02:02:48.902 --> 02:02:51.530
And you're going to help me get it.

1551
02:02:58.120 --> 02:02:59.288
Are we clear?

1552
02:03:06.837 --> 02:03:08.463
We leave in the morning.

1553
02:03:34.281 --> 02:03:35.282
Hi.

1554
02:03:35.449 --> 02:03:36.450
Good morning.

1555
02:03:39.077 --> 02:03:40.287
If we survive this...

1556
02:03:41.955 --> 02:03:45.167
I want you to know
you have a home with me in Haiti.

1557
02:03:48.003 --> 02:03:50.339
Here. Take my hands.

1558
02:03:53.634 --> 02:03:54.635
Breathe.

1559
02:03:59.014 --> 02:04:01.516
Shuri, I want you to be honest with me.

1560
02:04:01.683 --> 02:04:04.728
Who did you see when you took the Herb?

1561
02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:11.610
If you go to war for vengeance...

1562
02:04:11.777 --> 02:04:14.196
it will not fill the hole left from her loss.

1563
02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:16.657
It will only grow larger...

1564
02:04:16.823 --> 02:04:18.283
and it will consume you.

1565
02:04:20.535 --> 02:04:21.912
It already has.

1566
02:04:27.292 --> 02:04:34.049
K'uk'ulkan, another machine to
detect vibranium is in use in the ocean.

1567
02:04:34.883 --> 02:04:35.884
Where?

1568
02:05:05.455 --> 02:05:06.623
Get out of the water!

1569
02:05:51.293 --> 02:05:52.586
For the Queen.

1570
02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:08.411
<i>Riri, how's it going up there?</i>

1571
02:07:08.912 --> 02:07:10.080
<i>Hey, Mr. GRIOT.</i>

1572
02:07:10.247 --> 02:07:11.706
I could really use that backup right now.

1573
02:07:11.873 --> 02:07:13.834
<i>I thought you'd never ask.</i>

1574
02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:20.632
<i>Shit.</i>

1575
02:07:25.095 --> 02:07:26.471
<i>Shit, he's fast.</i>

1576
02:07:27.139 --> 02:07:28.348
<i>But I'm faster.</i>

1577
02:07:48.326 --> 02:07:49.369
<i>I got you.</i>

1578
02:07:55.709 --> 02:07:57.043
<i>It's on you now, Shuri.</i>

1579
02:08:06.219 --> 02:08:07.929
-Princess.
-No.

1580
02:08:08.096 --> 02:08:11.600
I am the Black Panther,
and I'm here for retribution!

1581
02:08:12.267 --> 02:08:15.270
<i>Pervaporation cells activated.</i>

1582
02:08:24.696 --> 02:08:25.697
What's wrong?

1583
02:08:26.448 --> 02:08:27.741
You need a glass of water?

1584
02:08:31.745 --> 02:08:32.746
Yo, we got him.

1585
02:08:32.913 --> 02:08:34.539
-Good!
-Namor has been captured.

1586
02:08:34.915 --> 02:08:36.082
Retreat back!

1587
02:08:40.962 --> 02:08:42.464
Back to Wakanda!

1588
02:08:48.178 --> 02:08:49.179
Move out!

1589
02:09:14.246 --> 02:09:15.413
What is going on?

1590
02:09:16.248 --> 02:09:18.124
The sonic emitter has been destroyed.

1591
02:09:40.355 --> 02:09:41.856
That can't be good.

1592
02:10:13.972 --> 02:10:16.141
<i>Panther, the Sea Leopard has lost power...</i>

1593
02:10:16.308 --> 02:10:18.268
<i>and they are experiencing
significant casualties.</i>

1594
02:10:19.811 --> 02:10:20.812
Okoye.

1595
02:10:20.979 --> 02:10:22.314
<i>Panther.</i>

1596
02:10:23.398 --> 02:10:24.482
Aneka.

1597
02:10:25.734 --> 02:10:26.735
Okoye.

1598
02:10:26.901 --> 02:10:28.153
It is time.

1599
02:10:39.039 --> 02:10:40.081
For Wakanda!

1600
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:42.000
<i>Wakanda!</i>

1601
02:10:50.342 --> 02:10:51.968
GRIOT, what's the damage?

1602
02:10:52.135 --> 02:10:54.429
<i>Catastrophic. His spear is
made of raw vibranium.</i>

1603
02:10:54.596 --> 02:10:57.015
<i>-The ship could explode at any second.
-Get us to the desert.</i>

1604
02:11:15.825 --> 02:11:16.826
<i>No!</i>

1605
02:11:45.438 --> 02:11:46.981
Sink the ship!

1606
02:12:14.551 --> 02:12:15.552
I got you, sis.

1607
02:12:15.718 --> 02:12:16.719
<i>Hold on.</i>

1608
02:13:21.034 --> 02:13:22.368
Warrior!

1609
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:28.124
You speak the mother tongue?

1610
02:13:28.416 --> 02:13:30.793
You can greet your ancestors with it...

1611
02:14:00.907 --> 02:14:02.116
<i>Get off me!</i>

1612
02:14:14.170 --> 02:14:15.380
<i>All right, come here.</i>

1613
02:14:18.675 --> 02:14:22.053
You will greet your ancestors.

1614
02:14:45.994 --> 02:14:47.662
May the ancestors save us...

1615
02:14:47.829 --> 02:14:49.372
if the princess does not hurry.

1616
02:14:49.539 --> 02:14:51.249
We may be going to join them.

1617
02:14:52.166 --> 02:14:53.251
If so, hey...

1618
02:14:53.418 --> 02:14:55.670
let us take as many of them with us
as we can.

1619
02:15:25.783 --> 02:15:27.201
It could've been different.

1620
02:15:31.789 --> 02:15:33.249
I need water.

1621
02:15:50.016 --> 02:15:52.143
<i>Are you gonna be noble like your brother...</i>

1622
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:53.686
<i>or take care of business...</i>

1623
02:15:53.853 --> 02:15:54.896
like me?

1624
02:15:55.063 --> 02:15:56.606
I'm not my brother.

1625
02:15:58.024 --> 02:16:00.026
Namor will beg me for mercy...

1626
02:16:00.693 --> 02:16:03.237
as I stand and watch as he dies.

1627
02:16:42.151 --> 02:16:44.529
Imperius Rex.

1628
02:16:47.198 --> 02:16:48.408
Wakanda forever!

1629
02:18:37.058 --> 02:18:38.559
Shuri.

1630
02:18:40.102 --> 02:18:41.103
Mama.

1631
02:18:44.065 --> 02:18:45.358
Show him...

1632
02:18:45.733 --> 02:18:47.276
who you are.

1633
02:18:54.116 --> 02:18:55.117
Yield...

1634
02:18:56.327 --> 02:18:58.663
and Wakanda will protect your oceans.

1635
02:18:58.830 --> 02:19:01.082
We will protect your secrets.

1636
02:19:01.249 --> 02:19:02.250
Yield...

1637
02:19:03.501 --> 02:19:05.211
and your people will live.

1638
02:19:09.298 --> 02:19:11.634
Vengeance has consumed us.

1639
02:19:12.093 --> 02:19:14.720
We cannot let it consume our people.

1640
02:19:23.521 --> 02:19:25.273
I yield.

1641
02:19:50.256 --> 02:19:52.425
Talokanile'ex!

1642
02:19:54.343 --> 02:19:55.887
Let us return home.

1643
02:19:56.429 --> 02:19:57.847
Our fight here is done.

1644
02:20:10.735 --> 02:20:12.612
Wakanda forever!

1645
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:14.655
Wakanda forever!

1646
02:20:59.033 --> 02:21:00.534
Thank you, my love.

1647
02:21:24.350 --> 02:21:25.518
Yo.

1648
02:21:30.022 --> 02:21:31.148
All set to head home?

1649
02:21:31.315 --> 02:21:33.859
As long as you're sure the police
won't be waiting for me at the airport.

1650
02:21:34.026 --> 02:21:35.653
Don't worry. Took care of that.

1651
02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:39.448
But you might want to slow down
on your homework-for-hire business.

1652
02:21:39.615 --> 02:21:41.909
Get caught slipping,
I can't help you with that.

1653
02:21:43.202 --> 02:21:45.037
They said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

1654
02:21:45.204 --> 02:21:46.205
Yes.

1655
02:21:46.539 --> 02:21:49.750
Your suit.
It's a great design...

1656
02:21:50.292 --> 02:21:51.544
but can't let you leave with it.

1657
02:21:51.711 --> 02:21:52.920
It's all good.

1658
02:21:53.087 --> 02:21:56.048
Figured the least I could do
is help Wakanda clean up my mess.

1659
02:21:57.299 --> 02:21:58.801
I have one more thing to show you.

1660
02:21:59.218 --> 02:22:00.219
Come.

1661
02:22:04.223 --> 02:22:07.309
Took me a while to find
all the parts from the river...

1662
02:22:07.476 --> 02:22:08.853
but it was worth it.

1663
02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:10.521
How did you...

1664
02:22:11.856 --> 02:22:13.399
It's my dad's car.

1665
02:22:14.650 --> 02:22:16.360
We used to work on it before...

1666
02:22:22.324 --> 02:22:24.201
-You sure this is her?
-Every part.

1667
02:22:24.368 --> 02:22:25.828
Have it shipped to Boston.

1668
02:22:25.995 --> 02:22:27.288
Be there before you arrive.

1669
02:22:32.877 --> 02:22:33.878
Bring it in, man.

1670
02:22:37.423 --> 02:22:41.719
<i>Panther, Miss Williams' transport
has arrived.</i>

1671
02:22:42.344 --> 02:22:43.888
Look after yourself.

1672
02:22:44.221 --> 02:22:46.640
Sure you're not trying to slide to Chicago?

1673
02:22:46.807 --> 02:22:47.892
Catch a Bulls game?

1674
02:22:49.143 --> 02:22:53.606
Sounds fun, but I have something
I need to take care of.

1675
02:23:18.339 --> 02:23:20.800
And now I present to you...

1676
02:23:20.966 --> 02:23:22.134
Princess Shuri...

1677
02:23:22.301 --> 02:23:23.594
the Black Panther!

1678
02:23:42.071 --> 02:23:44.907
The Black Panther sends her regards...

1679
02:23:45.699 --> 02:23:47.701
but she will not be joining us today.

1680
02:23:48.828 --> 02:23:50.788
I, M'Baku...

1681
02:23:50.955 --> 02:23:53.499
leader of the Jabari Tribe...

1682
02:23:53.666 --> 02:23:55.126
son of Wakanda...

1683
02:23:56.627 --> 02:23:58.379
wish to challenge...

1684
02:23:59.463 --> 02:24:00.589
for the throne.

1685
02:24:06.303 --> 02:24:07.972
What is troubling you, my child?

1686
02:24:09.849 --> 02:24:16.856
I looked forward to fighting
alongside you my entire life...

1687
02:24:17.815 --> 02:24:22.903
The thought of you
kneeling to the Wakandans...

1688
02:24:23.279 --> 02:24:28.117
The Black Panther
had every reason to kill me.

1689
02:24:28.951 --> 02:24:32.079
Why do you think
she didn't go through with it?

1690
02:24:33.914 --> 02:24:38.419
The Black Panther is the most powerful person

1691
02:24:38.794 --> 02:24:44.508
in the most powerful nation on the surface.

1692
02:24:44.758 --> 02:24:47.761
But she has no allies.

1693
02:24:48.137 --> 02:24:52.725
Now she has empathy
for the people of Talokan.

1694
02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:56.645
With this alliance...

1695
02:24:57.354 --> 02:25:04.361
Talokan will be stronger than ever.

1696
02:25:04.820 --> 02:25:08.699
The surface world will come for Wakanda

1697
02:25:09.533 --> 02:25:12.411
and Wakanda will turn to us.

1698
02:25:14.079 --> 02:25:15.706
Trust me.

1699
02:25:32.431 --> 02:25:33.682
What the hell is this?

1700
02:25:33.849 --> 02:25:35.059
Can we turn around?

1701
02:25:36.685 --> 02:25:38.646
I don't know, man. We'll lose an hour.

1702
02:25:40.064 --> 02:25:41.482
Why don't you go check it out?

1703
02:25:41.649 --> 02:25:42.858
Okay.

1704
02:25:45.653 --> 02:25:46.946
Yeah, this is Shauver.

1705
02:25:47.363 --> 02:25:49.365
Yeah, looks like we got
a tree blocking our way.

1706
02:25:49.531 --> 02:25:51.283
How do you want us to proceed?

1707
02:25:51.784 --> 02:25:52.785
What the...

1708
02:26:04.797 --> 02:26:07.132
A colonizer in chains.

1709
02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:09.885
Now I have seen everything.

1710
02:26:10.052 --> 02:26:11.053
Funny.

1711
02:26:11.804 --> 02:26:12.805
Let's go.

1712
02:26:39.623 --> 02:26:40.624
Thank you.

1713
02:26:40.708 --> 02:26:41.709
You're welcome.

1714
02:26:46.714 --> 02:26:47.715
Hey.

1715
02:26:49.049 --> 02:26:50.592
Welcome!

1716
02:26:52.386 --> 02:26:53.804
It's good to see you.

1717
02:26:54.555 --> 02:26:55.764
Everything is ready.

1718
02:26:55.931 --> 02:26:57.308
Just give me one moment, eh?

1719
02:26:57.474 --> 02:26:58.809
Actually...

1720
02:26:58.976 --> 02:27:00.853
I think I should do it on my own.

1721
02:27:02.062 --> 02:27:03.439
Of course.

1722
02:31:38.463 --> 02:31:39.464
Shuri...

1723
02:31:40.799 --> 02:31:42.509
can we join you now?

1724
02:31:45.596 --> 02:31:48.640
This is my son, Toussaint.

1725
02:31:49.808 --> 02:31:50.809
Toussaint...

1726
02:31:51.476 --> 02:31:54.605
this is your aunty, Shuri.

1727
02:31:56.023 --> 02:31:57.024
Hi.

1728
02:32:17.961 --> 02:32:20.631
We agreed it was better for him
to grow up here.

1729
02:32:20.797 --> 02:32:23.884
Away from the pressure of the throne.

1730
02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:26.470
Your father...

1731
02:32:27.095 --> 02:32:28.847
your <i>baba...</i>

1732
02:32:29.014 --> 02:32:31.683
prepared us for his death, didn't he?

1733
02:32:36.355 --> 02:32:38.398
But he didn't want us to go to the funeral...

1734
02:32:39.232 --> 02:32:42.152
because he felt the time was not yet right.

1735
02:32:42.861 --> 02:32:45.656
So we had our own ceremony for him here.

1736
02:32:47.407 --> 02:32:48.992
Did my mother meet him?

1737
02:32:49.076 --> 02:32:50.077
She did.

1738
02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:00.712
It's nice to meet you.

1739
02:33:00.879 --> 02:33:02.172
Nice to meet you.

1740
02:33:02.339 --> 02:33:03.882
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

1741
02:33:04.383 --> 02:33:06.510
It holds a great history.

1742
02:33:06.677 --> 02:33:09.971
Thanks. Yours is cool, too, I guess.

1743
02:33:13.266 --> 02:33:15.394
My mom says you are good
at keeping secrets.

1744
02:33:15.519 --> 02:33:16.520
Is that true?

1745
02:33:17.771 --> 02:33:20.565
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

1746
02:33:23.568 --> 02:33:25.862
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

1747
02:33:28.824 --> 02:33:29.991
Who are you?

1748
02:33:30.909 --> 02:33:35.122
My name is Prince T'Challa,
son of King T'Challa.
