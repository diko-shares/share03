1
00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:05.333
We give thanks for the gift of King T'Challa.

2
00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:11.005
The Black Panther.

3
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.343
Son of King T'Chaka.

4
00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:16.927
My son.

5
00:02:17.094 --> 00:02:22.433
Descendant of the most revered King Bashenga,

6
00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:25.394
the first Black Panther.

7
00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.647
We release you.

8
00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:29.899
Praise the ancestors.

9
00:07:21.815 --> 00:07:28.822
France has information that vibranium can be
used to make weapons of mass destruction.

10
00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:32.743
It does not trigger any known metal detector.

11
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:39.249
It is a threat to global security
and the non-proliferation regime.

12
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.166
I just lost security visuals.

13
00:08:25.754 --> 00:08:28.424
Down on your stomachs right now!

14
00:08:28.549 --> 00:08:30.050
Face to the floor! Go! Go!

15
00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:32.386
Where are the vibranium tools?

16
00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:37.266
Who has access?

17
00:10:56.113 --> 00:10:57.698
Kneel!

18
00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:02.536
You're welcome.

19
00:17:08.401 --> 00:17:09.444
Go!

20
00:19:25.538 --> 00:19:27.248
My Queen.

21
00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:41.792
My Queen,

22
00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:00.324
My Queen.

23
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.220
Yes, my Queen.

24
00:46:22.654 --> 00:46:23.655
Oh my!

25
00:48:17.602 --> 00:48:18.770
Kill the scientist.

26
00:48:18.937 --> 00:48:20.563
I'll deal with the witnesses.

27
00:48:20.814 --> 00:48:21.815
OK.

28
00:48:26.653 --> 00:48:28.363
Kill that woman first.

29
00:49:04.649 --> 00:49:06.693
Go to Namora.

30
00:50:15.803 --> 00:50:18.306
You're not worth my blade.

31
00:50:30.944 --> 00:50:32.487
What's taking so long?

32
00:50:32.862 --> 00:50:35.490
This is not a time for games.

33
00:53:54.272 --> 00:53:55.398
Permission to speak...

34
00:53:55.481 --> 00:53:56.482
my Queen?

35
00:53:59.402 --> 00:54:00.862
I beg of you.

36
00:54:09.245 --> 00:54:11.247
I'm asking you, mother.

37
00:58:28.754 --> 00:58:29.755
Hello.

38
00:58:36.387 --> 00:58:37.972
You're here for the headmistress?

39
00:58:45.146 --> 00:58:46.147
She's there.

40
00:58:47.064 --> 00:58:48.816
Very good.

41
00:58:56.198 --> 00:58:57.199
Hello.

42
00:59:03.372 --> 00:59:06.876
Please excuse us for a moment.

43
00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:12.048
Hello.

44
00:59:12.131 --> 00:59:13.132
Hello.

45
00:59:13.215 --> 00:59:14.216
Hello.

46
01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:31.001
Thank you.

47
01:00:45.558 --> 01:00:47.476
That was a long time ago.

48
01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:35.733
Princess.

49
01:01:36.942 --> 01:01:39.069
Here royalty wears traditional clothing.

50
01:01:39.486 --> 01:01:41.655
We had this made for you.

51
01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:10.309
Come with me.

52
01:02:27.826 --> 01:02:28.827
Eat?

53
01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:45.052
Hello Ma'am. It's nice to meet you.

54
01:02:45.219 --> 01:02:46.262
What can I help you with?

55
01:02:47.638 --> 01:02:50.349
My name is Maria Aldana.
I'm a student from Merida...

56
01:02:50.683 --> 01:02:52.393
I'm not interested. Go away. Please.

57
01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:56.563
Yes, of course. I don't mean to bother you.
Just give me a second...

58
01:02:57.022 --> 01:02:59.024
My professor mentioned a study

59
01:02:59.191 --> 01:03:03.737
where you told researchers that
you encountered something...

60
01:03:04.571 --> 01:03:06.824
Someone unimaginable.

61
01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.244
Nothing good came of speaking
with those outsiders.

62
01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:11.829
I'm begging you.

63
01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:13.163
Leave. Now.

64
01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:16.959
I've encountered him too.

65
01:03:28.512 --> 01:03:32.433
Sometimes we would catch a
glimpse of a man with winged feet...

66
01:03:33.684 --> 01:03:35.352
...on the shore of the beach.

67
01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:37.980
We thought he was a spirit.

68
01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:40.399
The K'uk'ulkan.

69
01:03:40.899 --> 01:03:43.360
Our Feathered Serpent God,

70
01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:47.114
...of this realm and the realm below.

71
01:03:47.948 --> 01:03:50.617
I would very much like to visit that beach.

72
01:03:51.368 --> 01:03:52.369
Be warned...

73
01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:58.917
K'uk'ulkan has been here for
much longer than you and I.

74
01:03:59.251 --> 01:04:01.337
Others who have searched for him

75
01:04:01.587 --> 01:04:03.213
with ill in their hearts...

76
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:04.631
have never returned.

77
01:04:05.883 --> 01:04:07.343
Lost to the depths...

78
01:04:08.802 --> 01:04:10.763
forever...

79
01:06:30.944 --> 01:06:32.112
No. My baby.

80
01:06:43.081 --> 01:06:45.000
Your baby is sick.

81
01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:47.294
Only this can heal him.

82
01:06:47.794 --> 01:06:51.423
Your baby will be the first to be born
in our new home.

83
01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:54.259
Take this gift as a promise...

84
01:06:54.426 --> 01:06:57.930
He will be our new king.

85
01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:45.602
Let's go!

86
01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:04.931
Whose child is this?

87
01:09:20.572 --> 01:09:21.573
Shoot!

88
01:09:22.032 --> 01:09:23.033
FIRE!

89
01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:40.801
Thou art a demon.

90
01:09:41.593 --> 01:09:42.844
Son of Satan.

91
01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:49.643
Thou art a child without love.

92
01:09:50.477 --> 01:09:51.645
The child without love.

93
01:20:01.921 --> 01:20:04.048
You have been summoned...

94
01:20:04.215 --> 01:20:05.425
K'uk'ulkan.

95
01:23:46.395 --> 01:23:47.688
Drop your spear!

96
01:23:47.855 --> 01:23:49.315
Kill the Princess!

97
01:23:55.404 --> 01:23:56.739
Drop your knife.

98
01:23:57.156 --> 01:23:58.157
You...

99
01:23:58.991 --> 01:24:00.117
You killed her.

100
01:24:00.993 --> 01:24:02.286
Let her go

101
01:24:02.495 --> 01:24:04.455
and you don't have to die.

102
01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.045
Move your left arm.

103
01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:24.869
You're welcome.

104
01:25:33.544 --> 01:25:35.379
What happened my child?

105
01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:39.175
The Wakandans.

106
01:25:39.967 --> 01:25:41.761
They came for her.

107
01:25:44.388 --> 01:25:46.432
K'uk'ulkan...

108
01:25:48.934 --> 01:25:52.396
can you save me?

109
01:26:05.743 --> 01:26:07.119
Is she dead?

110
01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:10.581
Yes.

111
01:26:19.256 --> 01:26:21.592
Rest child.

112
01:26:24.136 --> 01:26:25.554
They came...

113
01:26:26.013 --> 01:26:29.975
while you spoke to the Queen?

114
01:26:31.394 --> 01:26:34.814
We should not have trusted her.

115
01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:38.526
The Princess has seen our home.

116
01:26:38.984 --> 01:26:41.195
What is stopping them

117
01:26:41.612 --> 01:26:43.739
from coming for Talokan?

118
01:26:45.991 --> 01:26:47.284
I will.

119
01:27:22.153 --> 01:27:23.612
Rise Talokan!

120
01:27:26.115 --> 01:27:27.742
Rise Talokan!

121
01:27:33.038 --> 01:27:35.082
I was blinded

122
01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:36.625
by hope

123
01:27:36.792 --> 01:27:38.502
of partnership.

124
01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:41.422
And...

125
01:27:42.047 --> 01:27:44.300
I have compromised

126
01:27:44.884 --> 01:27:47.011
all of us.

127
01:27:47.803 --> 01:27:48.929
Talokan

128
01:27:49.346 --> 01:27:50.806
will not move

129
01:27:50.973 --> 01:27:52.391
again.

130
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:54.351
Namora.

131
01:27:55.352 --> 01:27:56.353
Attuma.

132
01:27:58.481 --> 01:28:01.484
When we are done with them

133
01:28:04.403 --> 01:28:06.739
they will never think

134
01:28:06.906 --> 01:28:08.949
of approaching

135
01:28:09.116 --> 01:28:10.576
Talokan!

136
01:28:12.953 --> 01:28:14.288
Rise Talokan!

137
01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:51.005
Take this one.

138
01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:01.450
Let us turn! Turn around!

139
01:33:11.001 --> 01:33:12.127
Take the child.

140
01:34:10.853 --> 01:34:12.396
Warrior!

141
01:34:15.399 --> 01:34:16.400
...my child.

142
01:34:22.281 --> 01:34:23.282
Yes.

143
01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:24.741
We'll find your mama, OK?

144
01:34:42.342 --> 01:34:45.012
The defenses have been lured
away from the palace.

145
01:34:45.304 --> 01:34:47.347
It is up to you now.

146
01:36:06.093 --> 01:36:07.094
Mayday!

147
01:36:07.552 --> 01:36:08.553
Mayday!

148
01:39:16.825 --> 01:39:17.826
Come on, my Queen.

149
01:39:55.447 --> 01:39:56.448
Wake up, my Queen.

150
01:39:58.617 --> 01:39:59.743
Let me see.

151
01:40:00.368 --> 01:40:01.369
Wake up.

152
01:40:08.710 --> 01:40:09.878
Wake up, Mother.

153
01:40:10.545 --> 01:40:11.755
She has passed.

154
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.752
Listen to me.

155
01:50:40.466 --> 01:50:42.969
Hey, Shuri.

156
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:47.158
You did it!

157
01:52:42.964 --> 01:52:44.340
Ramonda.

158
01:52:44.715 --> 01:52:49.720
We beg of you, come to your daughter.

159
01:56:32.735 --> 01:56:33.903
Are you OK?

160
01:56:47.291 --> 01:56:48.292
What's going on?

161
02:00:56.206 --> 02:00:57.207
Yes.

162
02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:58.584
Yes.

163
02:02:58.120 --> 02:02:59.288
Are we clear?

164
02:03:53.634 --> 02:03:54.635
Breathe.

165
02:04:27.292 --> 02:04:34.049
K'uk'ulkan, another machine to
detect vibranium is in use in the ocean.

166
02:04:34.883 --> 02:04:35.884
Where?

167
02:05:05.455 --> 02:05:06.623
Get out of the water!

168
02:08:34.915 --> 02:08:36.082
Retreat back!

169
02:11:45.438 --> 02:11:46.981
Sink the ship!

170
02:13:21.034 --> 02:13:22.368
Warrior!

171
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:28.124
You speak the mother tongue?

172
02:13:28.416 --> 02:13:30.793
You can greet your ancestors with it...

173
02:14:18.675 --> 02:14:22.053
You will greet your ancestors.

174
02:15:31.789 --> 02:15:33.249
I need water.

175
02:16:42.151 --> 02:16:44.529
Imperius Rex.

176
02:19:23.521 --> 02:19:25.273
I yield.

177
02:19:50.256 --> 02:19:52.425
Talokanile'ex!

178
02:19:54.343 --> 02:19:55.887
Let us return home.

179
02:19:56.429 --> 02:19:57.847
Our fight here is done.

180
02:24:06.303 --> 02:24:07.972
What is troubling you, my child?

181
02:24:09.849 --> 02:24:16.856
I looked forward to fighting
alongside you my entire life...

182
02:24:17.815 --> 02:24:22.903
The thought of you
kneeling to the Wakandans...

183
02:24:23.279 --> 02:24:28.117
The Black Panther
had every reason to kill me.

184
02:24:28.951 --> 02:24:32.079
Why do you think
she didn't go through with it?

185
02:24:33.914 --> 02:24:38.419
The Black Panther is the most powerful person

186
02:24:38.794 --> 02:24:44.508
in the most powerful nation on the surface.

187
02:24:44.758 --> 02:24:47.761
But she has no allies.

188
02:24:48.137 --> 02:24:52.725
Now she has empathy
for the people of Talokan.

189
02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:56.645
With this alliance...

190
02:24:57.354 --> 02:25:04.361
Talokan will be stronger than ever.

191
02:25:04.820 --> 02:25:08.699
The surface world will come for Wakanda

192
02:25:09.533 --> 02:25:12.411
and Wakanda will turn to us.

193
02:25:14.079 --> 02:25:15.706
