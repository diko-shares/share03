Pumbaa, look at that little guy!

28
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.141
A chip off the old block. And you
gotta know who's gonna raise him.

29
00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.643
His parents?

30
00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.561
Okay, sure. Get technical.

31
00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:09.439
But who's gonna teach him
the really important stuff?

32
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.817
Like how to belch.

33
00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:13.610
And dig for grubs.

34
00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.823
I'm telling you, buddy,
it's gonna be like old times.

35
00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:20.283
You, me and the little guy.

36
00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.287
-It is a girl.
-Girl.

37
00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:26.123
-Girl?
-Girl?

38
00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:44.891
Wow!

39
00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:54.693
Where do you think you're going
in such a hurry?

40
00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.738
Daddy. Let go.

41
00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:00.991
Well, I just want you to be careful.

42
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:07.581
Kiara, are you listening?
Accidents can happen.

43
00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:12.836
-You could easily get hurt...
-Hurt or stepped on or even get lost.

44
00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.755
And remember,

45
00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.631
I want you to stay in sight
of Pride Rock at all times.

46
00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.091
At all times.

47
00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:22.512
I know. And if I see any strangers,
don't talk to them,

48
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.389
come straight home.

49
00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:27.851
Okay, okay. Can I go now? Please?

50
00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.812
Very funny.

51
00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:32.773
Mind your father, Kiara.

52
00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.399
Yes, Mom.

53
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.735
And stay away from the Outlands.

54
00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:41.573
Nothing there but a bunch
of backstabbing, murderous Outsiders.

55
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:45.202
Zazu's right.
You can't turn your back on them.

56
00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:47.662
Really? How come?

57
00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.040
Never mind.

58
00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.208
Just run along now.

59
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:52.584
But, Dad, I...

60
00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.544
You'll understand someday.

61
00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.171
-Go on.
-Dad!

62
00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:05.806
And stay on the path
I've marked for you.

63
00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.101
Simba, who does she remind you of?

64
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.771
What? Who?

65
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.941
She's just like you were
when you were young.

66
00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.359
Exactly.

67
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.612
Do you realise the dangers
we put ourselves in?

68
00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:23.990
You mean the dangers you put us in.

69
00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:30.997
She'll be fine.

70
00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.713
Hey, Timon, Pumbaa. Come here.

71
00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.675
Good morning, <i>mon capitaine!</i>

72
00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.135
I want you to keep
a close watch on Kiara.

73
00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:46.596
You know she's bound to run off.

74
00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:49.599
Don't worry, Simba.
We're on her like stink on a warthog.

75
00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:52.185
-Hey!
-It's a hard truth, Pumbaa. Live with it.

76
00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:54.479
Guys, I'm counting on you.

77
00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:57.566
Danger could be lurking
behind every rock.

78
00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:08.493
Hey, wait. Come back.

79
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.706
I just wanna play.

80
00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:18.712
The mighfy hunter

81
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.673
has cornered her prey.

82
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.269
Cool.

83
00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.521
The Outlands.

84
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.817
I wonder what's out there.

85
00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:04.007
Don't worry, Kiara.
Uncle Pumbaa's coming.

86
00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:07.010
No!

87
00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:12.599
Let's see. "Gee, Simba, the good news
is we found your daughter.

88
00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.143
"The bad news is we dropped
a warthog on her.

89
00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:16.686
"Is there a problem with that?"

90
00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:18.980
Kiara? Kiara!

91
00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:23.109
Pumbaa! Let me define "baby-sitting."

92
00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.075
Sorry.

93
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:34.037
Now, Princess Kiara,
as Simba's daughter,

94
00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.998
you know better than to go off all alone.

95
00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.334
-You could have been hurt.
-But...

96
00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.543
Hurt?

97
00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:42.754
Simba would kill us!

98
00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.589
-You didn't slip a disc, did you?
-But...

99
00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:48.301
-Catch a fever? Get a hangnail?
-Timon...

100
00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:49.970
-I had one once.
-Very painful.

101
00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.388
Excruciating.

102
00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:55.558
Darling, with your complexion,
you should stay out of the sun.

103
00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.895
What? Do you wanna wrinkle?

104
00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:01.356
Will somebody please just listen to me?

105
00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.526
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
Did you say something, Princess?

106
00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:07.112
I'm not just a princess, you know.

107
00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.239
That's only half of who I am.

108
00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:10.991
Who's the other half?

109
00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:13.952
Well, I...

110
00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.997
Well, while you're figuring it out,

111
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.373
let's eat!

112
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.961
Grubs.

113
00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.171
The other white meat.

114
00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:26.798
And so high in protein.

115
00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.592
Gross!

116
00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:32.387
No? How about you, big boy?

117
00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:37.517
-Love grubs.
-Not like.

118
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.102
-Love!
-Love!

119
00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.941
You always do that!

120
00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:47.569
You take a bite out of every one,
and then put it back.

121
00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:48.862
It drives me crazy.

122
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:53.575
But you can't tell from the outside
which are the real slimy ones.

123
00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:57.078
Slimy? Pumbaa,
my corpulent <i>com padre,</i>

124
00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.289
it's the crunchy ones
that make the meal.

125
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:07.255
-Slimy.
-Crunchy.

126
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.258
-Less filling.
-Tastes good.

127
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.827
Who are you, Pridelander?

128
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.293
What are you doing?

129
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:48.797
My father says
to never turn your back on an Outsider.

130
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.591
-You always do what Daddy says?
-No!

131
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:55.553
Bet you do.
Bet you're Daddy's little girl.

132
00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:59.849
An Outsider doesn't need anybody.

133
00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.310
I take care of myself.

134
00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.354
Really?

135
00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.398
Cool.

136
00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.070
Run!

137
00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:17.951
This way!

138
00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.212
-That was a close one.
-Yeah.

139
00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.931
Hey, what about me?

140
00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.308
I'll distract them. Run!

141
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.573
Look out!

142
00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:01.953
Move it!

143
00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:22.432
I did it.

144
00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:29.898
Man! Did you see
the size of those teeth?

145
00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:32.525
They were going...

146
00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:35.904
He just totally ate me up right there,

147
00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:39.073
and I jumped on his head,
and I bopped him so good...

148
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.327
We make such a good team. And you...

149
00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:45.747
You were really brave.

150
00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:49.209
Yeah? You were pretty brave, too.

151
00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.462
-My name's Kovu.
-I'm Kiara.

152
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.427
Tag! You're it!

153
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.640
Tag! You're it! You're it!

154
00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:11.481
Hello? You run, I tag. Get it?

155
00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.734
What's the matter?
Don't you know how to play?

156
00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.376
-Zira.
-Simba.

157
00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.342
-Nala.
-Zira.

158
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.094
Timon. Pumbaa.

159
00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.680
Great. Now that we all know each other,

160
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.224
get out of our Pride Lands!

161
00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:48.226
Your Pride Lands?

162
00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:55.233
These lands belong to Scar.

163
00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:57.694
I banished you from the Pride Lands.

164
00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:00.488
Now you and your young cub, get out.

165
00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:06.786
Haven't you met my son, Kovu?

166
00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:09.831
He was hand-chosen by Scar

167
00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.292
to follow in his paw prints

168
00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:15.545
and become king.

169
00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.927
That's not a king.
That's a fuzzy maraca.

170
00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:25.555
Kovu was the last born

171
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:29.225
before you exiled us to the Outlands,

172
00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:33.521
where we have little food, less water.

173
00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:37.025
You know the penalty
for returning to the Pride Lands.

174
00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:39.402
But the child does not.

175
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:43.281
However,
if you need your pound of flesh,

176
00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:44.490
here.

177
00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.206
Take him and get out.

178
00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.584
We're finished here.

179
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.297
No, Simba.

180
00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:02.759
We have barely begun.

181
00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:15.104
Bye.

182
00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.941
Bye.

183
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:31.329
Simba?

184
00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.012
Kiara,
what did you think you were doing?

185
00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.597
You could've been killed today.

186
00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:52.016
But, Daddy, I didn't mean to...

187
00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:55.103
I'm telling you this because I love you.

188
00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:58.231
-I don't wanna lose you.
-I know.

189
00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:01.984
If something happened to you,
I don't know what I'd do.

190
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.196
One day, I won't be here,

191
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.782
and I need you to carry on in my place.

192
00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:12.662
-You are part of the great Circle of...
-Circle of Life. I know.

193
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:15.415
Exactly. And you need to be careful.

194
00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:17.166
As future queen...

195
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.711
What if I don't wanna be queen?
It's no fun.

196
00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:23.923
That's like saying
you don't wanna be a lion.

197
00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:26.551
It's in your blood, as I am.

198
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.345

it's who you are.

You'll understand someday.

237
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.663
Kovu, Kovu, Kovu.

238
00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:27.291
Scar wasn't even his father.
He just took him in.

239
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.672
Hey, Vitani.
Where's the little termite Kovu?

240
00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:35.007
The Chosen One.

241
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:40.596
Nuka, where's Kovu?

242
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.516
Did you leave him out there
on his own again?

243
00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:46.394
Hey! It's every lion for himself out here.

244
00:19:46.477 --> 00:19:48.896
That little termite's gotta learn
to be on his own.

245
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:52.274
Mother's gonna be mad.
She told you to watch him.

246
00:19:52.483 --> 00:19:55.027
Who cares?
I should've been The Chosen One.

247
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:59.407
I'm the oldest. I'm the strongest.
I'm the smartest... These termites!

248
00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:07.415
I could be a leader
if she'd just give me a chance.

249
00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:11.127
Yeah, right.
Why don't you tell that to her?

250
00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.629
Yeah? Don't think I won't.

251
00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:16.424
Yeah? Here's your chance.

252
00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.552
What? Mother. Mother! Hi!

253
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.722
Mother, I caught
some field mice for your dinner.

254
00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:25.474
I left them by the... Okay.

255
00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:29.228
Hey, Kovu.

256
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.522
Wanna fight?

257
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:36.277
You were supposed to be watching him!

258
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:39.780
It's not his fault. I went off on my own.

259
00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:41.949
-What were you doing?
-Nothing.

260
00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:44.618
-Who has made us Outsiders?
-Simba.

261
00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:47.329
-Who killed Scar?
-Simba.

262
00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:51.709
What have I told you about them?

263
00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:54.044
I'm sorry, Mother.

264
00:20:54.128 --> 00:20:56.255
She didn't seem so bad.

265
00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:59.341
-I thought we could be...
-Friends?

266
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.928
You thought you'd get to the daughter,

267
00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:06.640
and Simba would welcome you
with open arms?

268
00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.310
What an idea!

269
00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:13.606
What an idea.

270
00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:17.359
You brilliant child.

271
00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:20.154
I'm so proud of you.

272
00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:26.994
You have the same conniving mind
that made Scar so powerful.

273
00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:42.551
Chosen One.

274
00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:53.729
I now see the path

275
00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:58.901
to our glorious return to power!

276
00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:01.570
-But I don't want...
-Hush!

277
00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:04.490
Hush, my little one.

278
00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:09.161

into a queen that will someday
make us all very proud.

319
00:25:11.093 --> 00:25:14.555
But this cub Kovu grows stronger,

320
00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:17.391
and Zira fills his heart with hate.

321
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.144
I'm very worried, Mufasa.

322
00:25:20.227 --> 00:25:22.604
Things are not going well, no.

323
00:25:26.942 --> 00:25:28.694
You have a plan?

324
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.614
What?

325
00:25:37.327 --> 00:25:42.082
Kovu. Kiara. Together?

326
00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:45.127
This is the plan?

327
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:48.130
Are you crazy? This will never work.

328
00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:51.800
Mufasa, you been up there too long.
Your head is in the clouds.

329
00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:57.347
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, all right, okay!

330
00:25:57.431 --> 00:26:00.809
I don't think this is going to work,
but I trust you.

331
00:26:00.893 --> 00:26:03.645
I just hope you know
what you are doing.

332
00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:15.282
You are ready.

333
00:26:17.785 --> 00:26:19.328
Nice.

334
00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:21.330
Very nice.

335
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:28.545
You have the same blackness
in your soul that Scar had.

336
00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:31.006
What is your destiny?

337
00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:35.677
I will avenge Scar.
Take his place in the Pride Lands.

338
00:26:35.886 --> 00:26:38.097
Yes. What have I taught you?

339
00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:40.432
Simba is the enemy.

340
00:26:40.516 --> 00:26:43.894
And what must you do?

341
00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:46.814
I must kill him.

342
00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:03.997
This is Kiara's first hunt.

343
00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:07.292
There she is!

344
00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:10.129
Kiara.

345
00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:17.594
-You can do it.
-It's your day.

346
00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:21.223
-Your first time.
-My, how you've grown.

347
00:27:26.436 --> 00:27:28.605
You'll do just fine.

348
00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:34.403
Daddy? You have to promise
to let me do this on my own. Promise?

349
00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:40.200
All right. I promise.

350
00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:10.439
Make sure she doesn't get hurt.

351
00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.967
This place is even creepier
since the hyenas ran off.

352
00:28:41.261 --> 00:28:44.181
I'm not scared, okay?

353
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.978
I just don't know why
we have to be here, that's all.

354
00:28:50.103 --> 00:28:54.149
If Kovu is so special,
why does he need us?

355
00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:55.817
I never even had a chance.

356
00:29:01.823 --> 00:29:04.576
That's it! Come on.

357
00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:07.537
Kiara has started her hunt.
We have to move quickly.

358
00:29:12.334 --> 00:29:13.835
Fire!

359
00:29:43.949 --> 00:29:46.243
Tango Charlie Alpha,
what's your position?

360
00:29:47.661 --> 00:29:51.707
Upright, head turned
slightly to the left, tail erect.

361
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.500
Why do I bother?

362
00:30:20.569 --> 00:30:22.696
This must be where
the deer and the antelope play.

363
00:30:28.368 --> 00:30:30.412
Timon, what are you doing here?

364
00:30:30.579 --> 00:30:31.997
Shopping!

365
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.751
We thought a nice pelt for the den,
some throw pillows, a little potpourri...

366
00:30:35.917 --> 00:30:37.336
My father sent you.

367
00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:40.047
After he promised
to let me do this on my own. He lied!

368
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:43.008
No. He just doesn't want you to get hurt.

369
00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:45.385
I should have known
he'd never give me a real chance.

370
00:30:46.595 --> 00:30:47.971
I'll do this on my own!

371
00:30:48.055 --> 00:30:50.182
Away from the Pride Lands.

372
00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:54.936
-Hey! Wait! Come back!
-Come back here! Kiara!

373
00:30:55.062 --> 00:30:56.605
Kiara, come back!

374
00:30:57.773 --> 00:30:59.191
She's gone again.

375
00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:02.069
Somebody's gotta get
a beeper for this kid.

376
00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.624
Let's light fires!

377
00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:25.717
<i>♪ Roasty toasty princess
Roasty toasty princess ♪</i>

378
00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:29.054
Hey, is it hot in here or is that just me?

379
00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:30.847
Fire!

380
00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:35.394
Come on.

381
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.049
The plan is in motion.

382
00:32:06.133 --> 00:32:07.300
Go!

383
00:32:13.056 --> 00:32:16.268
Don't worry, Simba. She'll be fine.

384
00:32:16.351 --> 00:32:17.811
What could happen?

385
00:32:19.354 --> 00:32:22.065
No. No! Kiara!

386
00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:26.528
Zazu, fly ahead. Find her.

387
00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:02.457
I must tell Simba!

388
00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:14.469
Where am I?

389
00:34:15.178 --> 00:34:18.348
You're safe. In the Pride Lands.

390
00:34:18.515 --> 00:34:21.393
The Pride Lands? No!

391
00:34:21.518 --> 00:34:24.062
Why'd you bring me here?
Who do you think you are?

392
00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:27.524
I think I'm the one
that just saved your life.

393
00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:30.026
Look, I had everything under control.

394
00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:31.653
Not from where I'm standing.

395
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.154
Then move downwind.

396
00:34:43.665 --> 00:34:45.417
What are you doing?

397
00:34:47.127 --> 00:34:48.169
Kovu?

398
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:51.172
Kiara!

399
00:34:52.674 --> 00:34:54.634
Kiara, you're all right.

400
00:34:54.718 --> 00:34:56.428
Father, how could you
break your promise?

401
00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:59.055
It's a good thing I did. I almost lost you.

402
00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:00.932
No more hunts for you, not ever.

403
00:35:01.141 --> 00:35:03.852
But I was doing just fine.
Even before Kovu...

404
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.687
Kovu?

405
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.024
Simba!

406
00:35:09.524 --> 00:35:11.610
Hey! You!

407
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.363
How dare you save
the king's daughter?

408
00:35:15.822 --> 00:35:18.199
You saved her? Why?

409
00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:21.745
-I humbly ask to join your pride.
-No!

410
00:35:21.828 --> 00:35:23.955
You were banished
with the other Outsiders.

411
00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:27.250
I have left the Outsiders. I'm a rogue.

412
00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:30.045
Judge me now for who I am.

413
00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:34.716
Or am I to be blamed
for a crime I didn't commit?

414
00:35:38.637 --> 00:35:41.556
Simba, you owe him
your daughter's life.

415
00:35:42.849 --> 00:35:45.977
Yes, sire. Clearly we are in his debt.

416
00:35:46.061 --> 00:35:49.397
And royal protocol demands
that all debts be paid.

417
00:35:49.481 --> 00:35:52.317
Though in this case,
you might want to make an exception.

418
00:35:57.447 --> 00:36:00.325
My father's law will prevail.

419
00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:03.328
For now, I reserve judgement.

420
00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:05.455
We'll see who you really are.

421
00:36:09.084 --> 00:36:11.127
Riffraff.

422
00:36:59.175 --> 00:37:00.635
Hey.

423
00:37:01.928 --> 00:37:03.972
Thanks for saving me today.

424
00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:07.392
What kind of hunter
are you anyway, Princess?

425
00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:09.060
You almost got yourself killed out there.

426
00:37:09.144 --> 00:37:10.145
What?

427
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:13.022
You wouldn't last
three days on your own.

428
00:37:13.857 --> 00:37:16.317
And I suppose you could teach me?

429
00:37:16.693 --> 00:37:18.236
Yeah.

430
00:37:18.737 --> 00:37:20.822
-Kiara!
-Coming.

431
00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:26.745
All right! Impress me.

432
00:37:26.828 --> 00:37:28.413
We start at dawn.

433
00:37:32.459 --> 00:37:34.669
I look forward to it.

434
00:37:40.508 --> 00:37:43.094
Did you see that? He let her go!

435
00:37:43.178 --> 00:37:44.721
-If that were me, I...
-Hush.

436
00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:46.848
The fire rescue worked perfectly,

437
00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:48.266
and Simba fell for it.

438
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:51.811
Now, the closer Kovu
gets to the daughter,

439
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.356
the closer he gets to Simba.

440
00:37:56.191 --> 00:37:59.778
And once he has Simba alone...

441
00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:14.417
Simba! Simba!

442
00:38:15.043 --> 00:38:17.462
-Help me!
-Father!

443
00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:25.053
No! Dad!

444
00:38:26.095 --> 00:38:28.348
Just a little farther...

445
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.812
Gotcha! Trust me.

446
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:35.980
Simba!

447
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.068
No!

448
00:38:40.568 --> 00:38:42.612
Scar.

449
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.283
Kovu?

450
00:38:48.201 --> 00:38:50.119
No!

451
00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:39.752
Good morning.

452
00:39:40.128 --> 00:39:42.297
I'm ready for my first lesson.

453
00:39:42.422 --> 00:39:44.048
I surprised you, huh?

454
00:39:46.134 --> 00:39:48.469
Hey, come on. Let's go.

455
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.411
Three, two, one...

456
00:40:13.786 --> 00:40:15.538
Gotcha!

457
00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:19.375
You could hear me, huh?

458
00:40:19.751 --> 00:40:21.836
Only a lot.

459
00:40:23.004 --> 00:40:26.007
You're still breathing too hard. Relax.

460
00:40:26.215 --> 00:40:30.970
Feel the earth under your paws,
so it doesn't shift and make noise.

461
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:39.395
Watch the master and learn.

462
00:40:46.819 --> 00:40:48.446
Don't eat me, please.

463
00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:52.283
I never really met your tyrant...
I mean, Scar. Scar.

464
00:40:52.367 --> 00:40:54.035
Heck of a guy. A little moody, but...

465
00:40:54.535 --> 00:40:57.372
Timon, what are you doing here?

466
00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.249
Kiara, thank goodness!

467
00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:02.835
Hey, for once, we're not following you.

468
00:41:02.919 --> 00:41:06.214
This just happens to be the best
smorgasbord in the Pride Lands.

469
00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:08.466
Bugs everywhere.

470
00:41:08.549 --> 00:41:11.719
But you don't call
for a reservation and...

471
00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:15.556
Get outta here, you scavengers!
Go on! Shoo! Shoo!

472
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:31.447
Timon! I'm getting tired.

473
00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:33.282
I gotta lose some pounds.

474
00:41:34.075 --> 00:41:36.369
Shoo! Go on! Shoo! Shoo!

475
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:39.789
Hey, maybe he could help.
Do you think?

476
00:41:39.872 --> 00:41:42.667
Shoo! Yeah, there's an idea.

477
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.752
Right. Let the vicious Outsider...

478
00:41:45.086 --> 00:41:47.922
Hey! Wait! I have an idea.

479
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:51.217
-What if he helps?
-What?

480
00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:52.635
You wanna lend a voice?

481
00:41:56.264 --> 00:41:57.932
Roar! Work with me!

482
00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:00.601
Like this.

483
00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:06.441
Come on. Do it again. Do it again.

484
00:42:10.778 --> 00:42:14.198
Why are we doing this?
What's the point of this training?

485
00:42:14.282 --> 00:42:17.160
Training? This is just for fun!

486
00:42:18.453 --> 00:42:19.495
Fun?

487
00:42:20.621 --> 00:42:23.916
Kid, you gotta get out more often. Fun!

488
00:43:00.661 --> 00:43:02.413
Hey, rhino!

489
00:43:10.296 --> 00:43:12.006
What a blast!

490
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.674
Sorry.

491
00:43:14.801 --> 00:43:16.135
You're okay, kid.

492
00:43:16.219 --> 00:43:18.221
-Hey!
-You're okay.

493
00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:23.893
Pardon me.
That's it, that's it, that's it!

494
00:43:29.649 --> 00:43:31.317
Sorry.

495
00:43:33.569 --> 00:43:35.530
Hey. Are you two coming or what?

496
00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:45.123
-Do you see that?
-What?

497
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:48.751
-Wow. Look at that. It's really pretty.
-Yeah.

498
00:43:49.752 --> 00:43:52.130
You're right. Look!

499
00:43:52.547 --> 00:43:54.215
There's one
that looks like a baby rabbit.

500
00:43:54.841 --> 00:43:57.343
-See the fluffy tail?
-Yeah.

501
00:43:57.927 --> 00:43:59.470
Hey! There's one that looks like

502
00:43:59.554 --> 00:44:02.223
two lions killing each other
for a scrap of meat.

503
00:44:03.224 --> 00:44:06.394
-I've never done this before.
-Really?

504
00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:09.438
My father and I
used to do this all the time.

505
00:44:10.565 --> 00:44:14.694
He says all the great kings
of the past are up there.

506
00:44:16.154 --> 00:44:17.822
Do you think Scar's up there?

507
00:44:25.163 --> 00:44:29.083
He wasn't my father,
but he was still part of me.

508
00:44:31.419 --> 00:44:34.505
My father has said there was

509
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:38.009
a darkness in Scar
that he couldn't escape.

510
00:44:38.926 --> 00:44:41.429
Maybe there's a darkness in me, too.

511
00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:56.152
Father, I am lost.

512
00:44:56.235 --> 00:44:58.196
Kovu is one of them.

513
00:44:58.279 --> 00:44:59.947
Scar's heir.

514
00:45:00.615 --> 00:45:03.367
-How can I accept him?
-Simba?

515
00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:09.874
I was seeking counsel
from the great kings.

516
00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:11.167
Did they help?

517
00:45:12.752 --> 00:45:14.754
Silent as stars.

518
00:45:14.837 --> 00:45:17.256
-My father would never...
-My Simba.

519
00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:20.801
You want so much
to walk the path expected of you.

520
00:45:21.594 --> 00:45:24.555
-Perhaps Kovu does not.
-What? How do you know...

521
00:45:26.098 --> 00:45:30.061
I can see them down there
just as easily as you can.

522
00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:32.104
Get to know him and see.

523
00:45:45.243 --> 00:45:47.995
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

524
00:45:49.538 --> 00:45:51.040
Kovu...

525
00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:54.210
It's just that my whole life
I've been trained to...

526
00:45:54.293 --> 00:45:56.504
Nothing. I gotta go.

527
00:45:56.837 --> 00:45:58.339
Kovu, wait.

528
00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:06.889
And where are you going?

529
00:46:06.973 --> 00:46:09.183
Nowhere.

530
00:46:09.684 --> 00:46:11.769
That's what you think.

531
00:46:13.479 --> 00:46:14.522
Who was that?

532
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.067
Friend of the family.

533
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.989
Come on! You follow old Rafiki.
He knows the way.

534
00:46:24.699 --> 00:46:26.075
The way to where?

535
00:46:26.951 --> 00:46:29.161
You follow, you'll see!

536
00:46:30.371 --> 00:46:31.497
Hurry now!

537
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.709
Kovu, come on!

538
00:46:38.713 --> 00:46:40.172
Where's he taking us?

539
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.968

It's kind of cold tonight. Come on in.

592
00:50:16.263 --> 00:50:18.098
Get him.

593
00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:21.268
What are you waiting for, Kovu?
Get him.

594
00:50:28.442 --> 00:50:31.612
-You're sure?
-Affirmative. I saw it with my own eyes.

595
00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:35.449
No. Kovu cannot betray us.

596
00:50:44.416 --> 00:50:46.669
Okay, I have to tell her today.

597
00:50:47.628 --> 00:50:49.463
Where do I start?

598
00:50:50.005 --> 00:50:53.133
Kiara, Zira had a plot.

599
00:50:53.217 --> 00:50:57.179
I was part of it,
but I don't wanna be because...

600
00:50:57.263 --> 00:50:59.265
It's because I love you.

601
00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.935
She'll never believe me.

602
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:06.397
But I gotta try.

603
00:51:07.106 --> 00:51:09.775
Kiara, I need to talk to you.

604
00:51:09.942 --> 00:51:12.319
Kiara, I don't want you
talking with him.

605
00:51:13.654 --> 00:51:15.614
I want to talk with him.

606
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:36.051
Scar couldn't let go of his hate,

607
00:51:36.135 --> 00:51:38.095
and in the end, it destroyed him.

608
00:51:38.345 --> 00:51:41.390
I've never heard
the story of Scar that way.

609
00:51:42.182 --> 00:51:43.601
He truly was a killer.

610
00:51:45.853 --> 00:51:47.646
Fire is a killer.

611
00:51:47.855 --> 00:51:51.692
Sometimes what's left behind can grow
better than the generation before.

612
00:51:54.028 --> 00:51:56.363
If given the chance.

613
00:52:02.703 --> 00:52:05.164
No. No!

614
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.249
No.

615
00:52:08.459 --> 00:52:10.586
-Why, Simba.
-Zira.

616
00:52:10.878 --> 00:52:15.257
What are you doing out here
and so alone?

617
00:52:19.553 --> 00:52:21.347
Well done, Kovu.

618
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.766
Just like we always planned.

619
00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:25.684
-You!
-No!

620
00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:27.394
I didn't have anything to do with this!

621
00:52:27.603 --> 00:52:28.729
Attack!

622
00:52:30.898 --> 00:52:32.566
No!

623
00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:48.123
Yes! We've got him.

624
00:52:49.583 --> 00:52:53.128
Remember your training. As a unit.

625
00:53:07.518 --> 00:53:10.145
-Simba!
-Get him, Kovu. Get him!

626
00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:12.022
Do it. Now!

627
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.734
I'll do it for you, Mother!

628
00:53:19.488 --> 00:53:21.365
Mother, are you watching?

629
00:53:21.615 --> 00:53:24.493
I'm doing it for you,
and I'm doing it for me.

630
00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:31.041
This is my moment of glory!

631
00:53:32.793 --> 00:53:33.836
No!

632
00:54:03.699 --> 00:54:04.742
Nuka.

633
00:54:05.325 --> 00:54:09.747
I'm sorry, Mother. I tried.

634
00:54:19.798 --> 00:54:20.841
Nuka.

635
00:54:27.848 --> 00:54:30.642
Father? Father! Zazu, get help!

636
00:54:31.059 --> 00:54:32.978
Yes, help. At once. Of course.

637
00:54:36.732 --> 00:54:37.775
Father.

638
00:54:40.402 --> 00:54:43.155
Simba, talk to me! What happened?

639
00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:46.700
Kovu. Ambush.

640
00:54:48.744 --> 00:54:49.828
No.

641
00:54:52.039 --> 00:54:54.875
It's all right, buddy. We're here for you.

642
00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:03.258
Scar, watch over my poor Nuka.

643
00:55:04.843 --> 00:55:06.762
You! You!

644
00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:18.398
What have you done?

645
00:55:18.482 --> 00:55:20.943
I didn't... I didn't mean to.

646
00:55:21.026 --> 00:55:22.694
It wasn't my fault. I...

647
00:55:23.862 --> 00:55:25.823
I did nothing.

648
00:55:25.906 --> 00:55:31.537
Exactly. And in doing so,
you betrayed your pride.

649
00:55:31.662 --> 00:55:33.580
Betrayed Scar.

650
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:35.916
I want nothing more to do with him.

651
00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:38.085
You cannot escape it.

652
00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:41.171
-Nuka is dead because of you!
-No.

653
00:55:41.588 --> 00:55:43.882
You've killed your own brother!

654
00:55:44.216 --> 00:55:45.425
No!

655
00:55:47.636 --> 00:55:51.765
Let him go.
Simba has hurt me for the last time.

656
00:55:52.099 --> 00:55:54.518
Now he has corrupted Kovu!

657
00:55:55.102 --> 00:55:58.522
Listen to me.
Simba is injured and weak.

658
00:55:58.605 --> 00:56:01.149
Now is the time to attack!

659
00:56:01.233 --> 00:56:04.152
We will take his entire kingdom

660
00:56:04.236 --> 00:56:06.780
by force!

661
00:56:16.456 --> 00:56:18.333
Daddy, it can't be true.

662
00:56:18.458 --> 00:56:20.043
It's Kovu!

663
00:56:21.128 --> 00:56:22.170
It's Kovu!

664
00:56:24.256 --> 00:56:26.049
Kovu!

665
00:56:33.473 --> 00:56:36.310
Why, I ought a...
Let me at him, let me at him!

666
00:56:36.393 --> 00:56:37.978
-Here. Hold me back.
-Okay.

667
00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:40.647
-Let me at him, let me at him!
-Okay.

668
00:56:41.982 --> 00:56:43.609
I think you're missing
the basic point here.

669
00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.322
-What's he doing?
-Look at that scar on his face.

670
00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:52.534
Why have you come back?

671
00:56:52.826 --> 00:56:55.913
Simba, I had nothing to do with...

672
00:56:55.996 --> 00:56:57.372
You don't belong here.

673
00:56:57.497 --> 00:57:00.000
Please. I ask your forgiveness.

674
00:57:00.334 --> 00:57:02.669
Daddy, please. Listen to him.

675
00:57:03.003 --> 00:57:04.087
Silence!

676
00:57:04.171 --> 00:57:06.757
When you first came here
you asked for judgement.

677
00:57:07.132 --> 00:57:08.675
And I pass it now!

678
00:57:12.179 --> 00:57:14.056
-Exile!
-No!

679
00:57:25.901 --> 00:57:27.402
No!

680
00:57:28.195 --> 00:57:29.529

714
00:59:54.299 --> 00:59:56.468
Father, please reconsider.

715
00:59:56.551 --> 00:59:59.054
You will not go anywhere
without an escort from now on.

716
00:59:59.304 --> 01:00:01.848
-No, that's not...
-He used you to get to me.

717
01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:05.435
No! He loves me. For me.

718
01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:06.853
Because you are my daughter.

719
01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.606
You will not leave Pride Rock.

720
01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:13.026
You will stay where I can keep
an eye on you, away from him.

721
01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:14.611
You don't know him.

722
01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:17.405
I know he's following
in Scar's paw prints.

723
01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:19.741
And I must follow in my father's.

724
01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:22.369
You will never be Mufasa!

725
01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:56.903
Kovu?

726
01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:05.912
Kovu?

727
01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:18.633

Hey.

764
01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:28.948
Hey, look.

765
01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:31.409
We are one.

766
01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:35.914
-What?
-Let's get outta here.

767
01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:40.877
We'll run away together
and start a pride all our own.

768
01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:45.173
Kovu, we have to go back.

769
01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:47.675
You're kidding.
But we're finally together.

770
01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:50.804
Our place is with our pride.

771
01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:56.434
If we run away,
they'll be divided forever.

772
01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:27.132
I can't believe we lost her again.
This is the eight thousandth time!

773
01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:29.801
-I thought you were gonna watch her.
-Me? You were gonna watch her.

774
01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:32.470
-I thought you were gonna watch her.
-No, you were gonna watch her.

775
01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:37.016
-Watch this!
-Take that, you creepy warthog!

776
01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:41.104
-Say it! Say it!
-Fat! Fatty! Fat! Fat!

777
01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:42.689
What are you doing?

778
01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.817
Good question. Let me ask you one.

779
01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:48.903
-Hypothetically.
-Very hypothetical.

780
01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:50.780
-There's this guy...
-But he's not a lion.

781
01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.824
No! No, he's not a lion.

782
01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:55.034
Definitely not a lion!

783
01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:59.497
And his daughter, say, vanished.

784
01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:00.832
Kiara's gone?

785
01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:03.293
Sire, the Outsiders are on the attack,

786
01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:06.045
heading this way. It's war!

787
01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:09.257
Zazu, find Kiara.
We'll assemble the lionesses.

788
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.800
Move now.

789
01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:58.097
It's over, Simba.

790
01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:03.186
I have dreamed
of nothing else for years.

791
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.188
Does she need a hobby.

792
01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:07.607
Last chance, Zira. Go home.

793
01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:09.776
I am home.

794
01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:13.947
Attack!

795
01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:29.963
Go for the eyes!

796
01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:31.965
Break his jaw!

797
01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:33.967
Hit him low!

798
01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:37.554
Get them! Do what you must!

799
01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:50.441
What do we do? What do we do?

800
01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:52.735
There's only one thing
we can do, Pumbaa.

801
01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:56.990
When the going gets tough,
the tough get going. That's our motto.

802
01:07:57.282 --> 01:08:00.159
I thought our motto was,
<i>"Hakuna matata."</i>

803
01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:02.203
Pumbaa, stop living in the past.

804
01:08:02.453 --> 01:08:03.830
We need a new motto.

805
01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:12.880
Like I said, let's get going!

806
01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:25.977
-Where's your pretty daughter, Nala?
-Vitani!

807
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:47.832
Don't anybody move.
This thing's loaded. I'll let you have it.

808
01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:50.877
Yeah!

809
01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:54.881
Talk about your winds of war.

810
01:08:57.884 --> 01:08:59.927
Simba.

811
01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:03.389
You're mine.

812
01:09:28.748 --> 01:09:30.416
Kiara?

813
01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:33.002
Kovu!

814
01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:34.962
Move.

815
01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.423
Stand aside.

816
01:09:37.882 --> 01:09:39.759
Daddy, this has to stop.

817
01:09:41.427 --> 01:09:45.181
You're even weaker than I thought.
Get out of the way.

818
01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:49.018
You'll never hurt Kiara or Simba.

819
01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:50.895
Not while I'm here.

820
01:09:52.105 --> 01:09:53.523
Stay out of this.

821
01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:57.944
A wise king once told me, "We are one."

822
01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:00.738
I didn't understand him then.

823
01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:03.282
Now I do.

824
01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:05.118
-But they...
-Them?

825
01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:07.954
Us? Look at them.

826
01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:10.373
They are us.

827
01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:13.084
What differences do you see?

828
01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:39.318
Vitani, now!

829
01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:41.654
No, Mother.

830
01:10:44.198 --> 01:10:46.200
Kiara's right.

831
01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:50.496
Enough.

832
01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.917
If you will not fight,

833
01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:58.087
then you will die as well.

834
01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:05.011
Where are you going?

835
01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:06.345
Get back here!

836
01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:10.349
Let it go, Zira.
It's time to put the past behind us.

837
01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:13.102
I'll never let it go!

838
01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:17.732
This is for you, Scar!

839
01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:22.945
Kiara!

840
01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:26.324
Kiara!

841
01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:30.077
Kiara!

842
01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:45.176
Hold on, Kiara!

843
01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:51.641
Simba!

844
01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:53.976
Simba, the river!

845
01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.740
Zira, give me your paw.

846
01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:16.874
Zira, come on!

847
01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:20.586
I'll help you.

848
01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:50.116
Kiara.

849
01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.784
Daddy.

850
01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:53.786
I tried.

851
01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:58.082
Kiara!

852
01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:02.044
Wow! That was really brave!

853
01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:06.382
-Kovu.
-Kiara.

854
01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:08.968
Kovu?

855
01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:14.098
I was wrong. You belong here.

856
01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:22.356
Let's go home.

857
01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:25.651
All of us.

858
01:13:56.557 --> 01:13:59.685
-I love moments like this!
-Yeah.

859
01:14:00.019 --> 01:14:02.355
-Love, not like.
-Love, not like.

860
01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:04.690
-Love!
-Love!

861
01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:04.583
<i>Well done, my son.</i>

862
01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:16.887
<i>We are one.</i>
