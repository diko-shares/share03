00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:31.855
* LEGACY OF LIES *

2
00:01:41.998 --> 00:01:43.683
Red Star is on sight.

3
00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:46.963
Headed due south.
Payload is onboard.

4
00:01:57.021 --> 00:02:01.236
"KYIV, UKRAINE, 12 YEARS AGO".

5
00:02:04.713 --> 00:02:06.308
Stepanenko has arrived.

6
00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:08.658
Wait a second.

7
00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:13.508
You have the address
of the bank, right?

8
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.967
Yes. Oh, shit.

9
00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:20.604
Do you have the code?
Here it is.

10
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.542
Don't give anyone the address.

11
00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:26.725
Stepanenko is not alone.
Repeat, he's not...

12
00:02:29.368 --> 00:02:30.542
Ahh!

13
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:36.603
Red Star is down.
I need backup.

14
00:02:36.988 --> 00:02:38.143
Ah!...

15
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.774
They have the payload.
Where the fuck is my backup?

16
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.091
Olga. It's me, it's me!
No! No!

17
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.137
Martin? You okay?

18
00:03:21.177 --> 00:03:24.071
What are you doing here?
You stay in the car, don't move.

19
00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.401
Give me the bag.

20
00:04:51.807 --> 00:04:53.576
Throw me the bag.

21
00:04:54.318 --> 00:04:57.641
Let her go.
Do you hear what I'm saying?

22
00:04:57.667 --> 00:04:59.370
I'll throw the bag
when you let her go.

23
00:04:59.396 --> 00:05:01.739
I'll kill this damn bitch now!

24
00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:03.488
Just listen to me, all right?

25
00:05:03.514 --> 00:05:06.296
You let her go, and you walk away,
that will be the end of it.

26
00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:08.771
But if you do not,
you are a dead man.

27
00:05:08.938 --> 00:05:11.209
Throw me the fucking bag!

28
00:05:11.235 --> 00:05:13.803
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

29
00:05:20.767 --> 00:05:22.029
Come on!

30
00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:27.965
Come on, do it!

31
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.736
"PECKHAM, LONDON, PRESENT DAY".

32
00:05:59.131 --> 00:06:01.086
Twenty minutes. You all set?

33
00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:02.643
Yeah, I'm good.

34
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.479
What the hell is that?

35
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.147
Avocado salad, low-fat yogurt.

36
00:06:10.197 --> 00:06:11.489
I'm detoxing.

37
00:06:12.054 --> 00:06:14.004
You're detoxing. What for?

38
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.281
You're 12 years old.
So amazing.

39
00:06:17.307 --> 00:06:18.668
You can clean out
your whole body.

40
00:06:18.694 --> 00:06:21.750
It works on your mind
and your feelings and your life.

41
00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:23.753
Everything changes
for the better.

42
00:06:23.844 --> 00:06:25.873
It's so powerful,
do you know what I mean?

43
00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:31.908
Sorry, am I boring you?

44
00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:34.584
What did you say, sweetheart?

45
00:06:35.486 --> 00:06:36.690
Never mind.

46
00:06:37.102 --> 00:06:40.242
Listen. This Richie May.

47
00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:44.580
He's got the range,
but you got the power.

48
00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:46.523
He's really tricky.

49
00:06:47.153 --> 00:06:49.558
He's gonna keep you dancing
at the end of his jab,

50
00:06:49.584 --> 00:06:53.467
so you need to use your legs,
create space and bide your time.

51
00:06:53.576 --> 00:06:56.508
And when he gets tired,
move in for the knockout.

52
00:06:57.586 --> 00:07:01.388
Lees, I'm gonna do
what I always do, okay?

53
00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:04.299
I'm gonna walk him down,
smash straight through him.

54
00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.130
I don't think that will
work, Dad.

55
00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:08.046
Don't you worry about it,
you leave it up to me.

56
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.538
You're sure?
'Course I'm sure.

57
00:07:14.564 --> 00:07:16.944
Anyway, what is this,
20 Questions? Go on.

58
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.523
Okay

59
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.889
What are the odds
on the next match?

60
00:07:34.072 --> 00:07:37.031
Bully Boy, 2.8. Richie May, 1.9.

61
00:07:37.103 --> 00:07:39.668
2.8 for the Bull?
You kidding me?

62
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.200
Richie May won
the last K1 Grand Prix.

63
00:07:42.226 --> 00:07:45.030
He kicked the shit out of The Fly
and almost choked Garry Newman.

64
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.029
Bully Boy should be
way over three.

65
00:07:48.055 --> 00:07:49.824
2.8 it is.

66
00:07:52.227 --> 00:07:54.434
What's the minimum bet?
Fifty.

67
00:07:55.158 --> 00:07:57.783
Oh, you're a real high roller,
aren't you?

68
00:07:59.214 --> 00:08:01.827
Here's 500. Richie May.

69
00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:34.916
Are you ready?
Are you ready? Fight!

70
00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:02.239
Haymaker! Haymaker!

71
00:09:23.234 --> 00:09:25.544
He's got the range,
use your legs!

72
00:09:43.804 --> 00:09:44.958
Dad!

73
00:09:52.854 --> 00:09:55.555
Can you fight? Look at me.
Can you fight?

74
00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:57.424
Yeah!

75
00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:09.585
Stop! Come on, Dad!
Come on!

76
00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:13.155
It's time to stop!

77
00:10:14.567 --> 00:10:15.694
Dad!

78
00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:19.350
Dad!

79
00:10:45.463 --> 00:10:46.688
You all right?

80
00:10:53.499 --> 00:10:55.035
For the lady.

81
00:10:56.552 --> 00:10:59.404
Better luck next time,
Bully Boy.

82
00:11:02.698 --> 00:11:04.043
What the fuck is that?

83
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.023
Did you bet against me?

84
00:11:07.995 --> 00:11:11.302
I tried to warn you,
but you were clearly not listening.

85
00:11:11.887 --> 00:11:13.206
Why would you do that?

86
00:11:15.347 --> 00:11:16.521
Huh?

87
00:11:17.045 --> 00:11:18.935
I don't know what's
been up with you lately.

88
00:11:19.457 --> 00:11:22.116
You've just not been...
focused.

89
00:11:23.506 --> 00:11:26.802
Lees. Lees!

90
00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:50.824
Oh, my God, I gotta see you.

91
00:12:59.023 --> 00:13:00.654
Babe, are you all right?

92
00:13:07.983 --> 00:13:09.573
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to turn it on.

93
00:13:09.599 --> 00:13:11.478
Just go, all right? Just go.

94
00:13:11.967 --> 00:13:13.137
Baby.

95
00:13:14.165 --> 00:13:16.791
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't...
Just fucking leave!

96
00:13:16.866 --> 00:13:18.593
Just go! All right.

97
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.332
Ready?

98
00:14:03.858 --> 00:14:05.271
Remember what I told you.

99
00:14:07.172 --> 00:14:09.874
Dad, I've been thinking.
You like it here, right?

100
00:14:11.799 --> 00:14:13.035
It's all right.

101
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.997
I'm tired of moving
all the time.

102
00:14:16.304 --> 00:14:17.738
I think we should settle
down here.

103
00:14:17.764 --> 00:14:19.325
Open a restaurant or something.

104
00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:20.618
What do you think?

105
00:14:24.726 --> 00:14:26.620
You know what I think, Lees.

106
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:29.133
I think we should keep moving.
You know?

107
00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:31.410
That's the way we do it, right?
Me and you, we're a team.

108
00:14:31.887 --> 00:14:33.036
But why?

109
00:14:34.358 --> 00:14:36.171
Look, you're not concentrating,
are you?

110
00:14:36.197 --> 00:14:38.218
Do you remember what I said
about aiming the gun?

111
00:14:38.888 --> 00:14:41.000
Use these gun sights to aim.
All right?

112
00:14:41.026 --> 00:14:43.847
You don't look at the target,
target's in the background, blurry.

113
00:14:43.873 --> 00:14:45.696
You're still aiming at it,
but it's these.

114
00:14:45.722 --> 00:14:47.415
That's what you use to focus.
Yeah?

115
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:49.369
Come on, you know what to do.
Have another go.

116
00:14:50.798 --> 00:14:52.525
I want to start school this fall.

117
00:14:54.673 --> 00:14:55.855
What?

118
00:14:57.338 --> 00:15:00.712
Lees, you're not concentrating,
are you? Focus.

119
00:15:01.396 --> 00:15:04.921
Dad, I have to think about my future.
I have to have a profession.

120
00:15:05.066 --> 00:15:06.811
What, you want an office job?
Come on.

121
00:15:06.837 --> 00:15:08.084
I'm not saying that.

122
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.498
I could be, like,
a writer or an artist.

123
00:15:11.524 --> 00:15:13.383
Oh, yeah.
That's just what the world needs,

124
00:15:13.409 --> 00:15:15.604
is another artist begging
on the street for money.

125
00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.316
"Please, please pay me,

126
00:15:17.342 --> 00:15:19.777
pay me to express
my innermost thoughts".

127
00:15:19.803 --> 00:15:23.151
What have I always told you, Lees?
It's to be independent.

128
00:15:23.266 --> 00:15:25.211
Don't have to rely
on anyone else.

129
00:15:25.627 --> 00:15:27.666
But to be independent,
I have to have skills.

130
00:15:27.692 --> 00:15:29.321
You got plenty of skills.

131
00:15:29.638 --> 00:15:31.274
I taught you everything
you need to know.

132
00:15:32.334 --> 00:15:34.464
After this summer,
I'm starting school.

133
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:35.709
That's it.

134
00:15:41.162 --> 00:15:43.565
Police are investigating
the sudden illness

135
00:15:43.591 --> 00:15:47.499
of a Russian opposition
activist named Sergei Skuratov.

136
00:15:47.525 --> 00:15:49.064
Skuratov and his wife

137
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.512
were found unconscious Sunday
in New York's Central Park,

138
00:15:52.635 --> 00:15:55.257
after attending
the international summit...

139
00:15:55.283 --> 00:15:57.697
on regime evolution in Russia.

140
00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.431
This is a major incident.

141
00:15:59.457 --> 00:16:02.857
We have determined
that it was attempted murder

142
00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:05.407
by administration
of a nerve agent.

143
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:06.981
I will not...

144
00:16:07.456 --> 00:16:09.616
Lees, I'm off to work.

145
00:16:11.793 --> 00:16:13.472
Lees, off to work.

146
00:16:13.498 --> 00:16:16.534
Be back late, okay?
I've put you a pizza in the oven.

147
00:16:16.728 --> 00:16:18.423
Frozen pizza again?

148
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.623
Do you ever listen
to anything I say?

149
00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:22.423
I'm detoxing.

150
00:16:41.547 --> 00:16:45.215
All right, break it up, lads!
Right! I said break it up!

151
00:16:49.123 --> 00:16:51.845
Enough! Okay? Break it up!

152
00:16:51.871 --> 00:16:53.217
Get the fuck out of here!

153
00:16:54.456 --> 00:16:56.858
Mate, what the fuck was
that all about?

154
00:16:57.327 --> 00:16:59.318
You want the police
to turn up here again?

155
00:17:02.823 --> 00:17:04.179
Sorry, I'm all right.

156
00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:06.266
Listen to me.

157
00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:09.406
Get your shit together.
You hear me?

158
00:17:11.675 --> 00:17:12.935
Sorry, mate.

159
00:17:21.932 --> 00:17:23.736
Okay. Next.

160
00:17:24.925 --> 00:17:28.723
That was quite an impressive display
of anger management, Martin.

161
00:17:31.965 --> 00:17:33.403
Purse on the tray.

162
00:17:39.264 --> 00:17:42.712
Did you know that anger is always
preceded by feelings of pain?

163
00:17:44.681 --> 00:17:47.531
You should probably mind
your own business, don't you, love?

164
00:17:47.596 --> 00:17:48.760
Next.

165
00:17:49.246 --> 00:17:51.435
We are in the same business.
We need to talk.

166
00:18:29.121 --> 00:18:30.360
You forgot this.

167
00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.691
I'd be a bit more careful
with my belongings

168
00:18:35.717 --> 00:18:38.464
if I was you, Ms. Stepanenko.

169
00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:44.676
Interesting name, huh?
What is it? Russian?

170
00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.439
Ukrainian.

171
00:18:49.404 --> 00:18:52.669
You do remember my father,
Egor, don't you?

172
00:18:53.414 --> 00:18:56.760
You worked with him.
The Gazette?

173
00:18:56.786 --> 00:18:58.358
Kiev, 12 years ago?

174
00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:01.793
He told me you were the best
investigative reporter he'd ever met.

175
00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:05.787
I think you might have me
confused with somebody else.

176
00:19:09.795 --> 00:19:11.804
This was taken
on my father's cell phone.

177
00:19:11.898 --> 00:19:14.194
It was taken just a few days
before he died.

178
00:19:17.208 --> 00:19:20.979
My father,
his colleague Olga...

179
00:19:22.063 --> 00:19:23.947
and this is you, right?

180
00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:37.476
How did you find me?

181
00:19:39.316 --> 00:19:42.582
I'm a journalist,
just like my dad.

182
00:19:44.563 --> 00:19:45.850
What do you want?

183
00:19:46.882 --> 00:19:48.603
My father's mission is mine now.

184
00:19:48.967 --> 00:19:50.729
Nothing has changed
since he died.

185
00:19:51.528 --> 00:19:53.153
Have you seen the latest news?

186
00:19:53.564 --> 00:19:56.020
Look, what happened to your father,
that was a tragedy, but...

187
00:19:56.046 --> 00:19:57.727
I need your help to get the files.

188
00:20:04.974 --> 00:20:06.108
Down!

189
00:20:15.861 --> 00:20:17.024
Ah!...

190
00:20:48.316 --> 00:20:49.513
Sasha!

191
00:22:00.166 --> 00:22:03.309
Martin! You old fox.

192
00:22:03.387 --> 00:22:07.257
Home at last.
Been a long time, huh?

193
00:22:14.885 --> 00:22:16.445
What's going on, Trevor?

194
00:22:17.647 --> 00:22:19.822
Old lady throw you out again?

195
00:22:20.519 --> 00:22:22.616
Or CIA starting another war?

196
00:22:23.634 --> 00:22:26.229
Just craving a little chitchat
with an old buddy.

197
00:22:27.011 --> 00:22:28.250
Why don't you sit down?

198
00:22:36.886 --> 00:22:38.295
See you found the beer.

199
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.860
Pleased to meet you.
John Edwards, MI6.

200
00:22:44.023 --> 00:22:45.300
Heard a lot about you.

201
00:22:48.582 --> 00:22:51.095
You're bleeding.
Oh, don't worry.

202
00:22:51.121 --> 00:22:54.511
Nothing serious,
just a little intranasal tumor.

203
00:22:54.537 --> 00:22:55.944
Comes and goes.

204
00:22:56.184 --> 00:22:59.704
Just can't seem to find the time
to schedule the surgery, though.

205
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.114
I'd get on to that if I was you.
Can't be too careful.

206
00:23:07.576 --> 00:23:10.134
Wanna tell me what you're doing here
in the middle of the night?

207
00:23:10.207 --> 00:23:12.163
Alrighty.
Let's get down to it.

208
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.024
We're here because of your little
tête-à-tête with that cute reporter.

209
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.648
What exactly did you two discuss?

210
00:23:22.925 --> 00:23:25.620
I don't know what to tell you, Trevor.
I mean, I'm a bouncer.

211
00:23:25.646 --> 00:23:28.593
You know, part of the job description
is you gotta talk to people.

212
00:23:30.666 --> 00:23:34.116
When you quit MI6,
we had an agreement.

213
00:23:35.479 --> 00:23:38.262
You don't mess with our business,
we don't mess with yours.

214
00:23:38.649 --> 00:23:39.965
I told you then.

215
00:23:41.845 --> 00:23:45.735
If you try to get back in the game,
I'd take you out.

216
00:23:50.268 --> 00:23:53.747
Now...
did she mention the files?

217
00:23:55.507 --> 00:23:57.282
It's 12 years ago, Trevor.

218
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.206
Why the fuck are you
bringing it up now?

219
00:24:00.841 --> 00:24:03.513
You know what happened.
The Russians got the files.

220
00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:05.652
Mission not accomplished.

221
00:24:05.678 --> 00:24:06.774
Well...

222
00:24:07.307 --> 00:24:10.901
the reality turns out to be
a bit more complicated than that.

223
00:24:11.437 --> 00:24:12.572
Ah!...

224
00:24:13.542 --> 00:24:14.838
Please, enlighten me.

225
00:24:19.984 --> 00:24:21.979
We're all worried
about your health, Martin.

226
00:24:23.235 --> 00:24:24.716
What's that supposed
to mean?

227
00:24:26.939 --> 00:24:30.627
They will find you.
The Hilton, yesterday morning.

228
00:24:32.226 --> 00:24:33.919
He was less fortunate than you.

229
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.253
Who is he?
One of our chaps.

230
00:24:39.684 --> 00:24:43.049
Got too close to her.
They nabbed him by surprise.

231
00:24:43.785 --> 00:24:45.554
The stakes have gone up,
Martin.

232
00:24:45.588 --> 00:24:48.551
The Russians have repeatedly
used nerve agent in the UK.

233
00:24:48.577 --> 00:24:50.777
Now they've done
it on our turf as well.

234
00:24:53.842 --> 00:24:56.067
We consider this an act of war.

235
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.272
Work with us Martin,
we'll protect you.

236
00:25:01.646 --> 00:25:03.570
Otherwise, well...

237
00:25:04.744 --> 00:25:06.921
you could end up
with a new smile too.

238
00:25:08.372 --> 00:25:09.528
Dad?

239
00:25:10.129 --> 00:25:11.967
Lees, back to bed, please.

240
00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:14.581
Back to bed. Lees!

241
00:25:17.521 --> 00:25:21.873
Last time I saw you,
you were wearing a poopy diaper.

242
00:25:21.899 --> 00:25:22.990
Can't sleep.

243
00:25:23.016 --> 00:25:25.174
You need to go back to bed,
sweetheart, okay?

244
00:25:26.039 --> 00:25:27.860
Some daughter you got there.

245
00:25:28.995 --> 00:25:32.432
She's growing up fast.
Looks just like her mother.

246
00:25:33.093 --> 00:25:34.897
I look like myself.

247
00:25:37.363 --> 00:25:38.612
Listen, Martin,

248
00:25:39.122 --> 00:25:41.816
I get you don't give
a rat's ass about the Russians.

249
00:25:41.842 --> 00:25:44.352
Fine.
But you realize those files

250
00:25:44.378 --> 00:25:47.886
would probably expose the scumbag
who betrayed us in Kiev.

251
00:25:50.396 --> 00:25:52.482
If we find the rat
in our network,

252
00:25:52.683 --> 00:25:56.287
I promise you,
he will face a firing squad.

253
00:25:58.495 --> 00:26:01.856
Don't you want to know who's
responsible for her mother's death?

254
00:26:03.319 --> 00:26:05.196
My mother was in an accident.

255
00:26:05.592 --> 00:26:08.720
An accident? Trevor...
A car accident.

256
00:26:09.843 --> 00:26:11.251
You didn't tell her?

257
00:26:11.658 --> 00:26:13.216
Tell me...
Right, that's enough.

258
00:26:13.242 --> 00:26:15.301
Get out. Lees! Lees!

259
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.334
Think about the traitor,
Martin.

260
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.809
Wouldn't you just love to
encourage his disappearance?

261
00:26:23.859 --> 00:26:27.938
Trevor, I told you before,
I'm out. Now, fuck off!

262
00:26:28.216 --> 00:26:29.354
Very well.

263
00:26:29.656 --> 00:26:32.239
If there's ever anything
you'd like to share with me,

264
00:26:32.643 --> 00:26:36.006
you know where to find me.
Good seeing you again, Martin.

265
00:26:49.813 --> 00:26:52.989
I'm sorry, Lees.
I was gonna tell you.

266
00:26:53.306 --> 00:26:55.849
Go away.
Lees, honey, just...

267
00:26:55.875 --> 00:26:59.515
Will listen to me, please?
You lied to me.

268
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.522
I was gonna tell you
when you were older.

269
00:27:03.398 --> 00:27:05.595
Go away. Leave me alone.

270
00:27:05.621 --> 00:27:07.688
Please, honey, just...

271
00:27:11.675 --> 00:27:13.103
You lied to me.

272
00:27:41.974 --> 00:27:44.761
Promise me it will always
be like this.

273
00:27:45.764 --> 00:27:48.331
Promise!
All right, I promise.

274
00:27:48.897 --> 00:27:51.468
I promise.
I don't believe you.

275
00:27:55.848 --> 00:27:56.967
Hey!...

276
00:28:22.635 --> 00:28:25.328
Today, American
counterterrorism forces

277
00:28:25.354 --> 00:28:27.411
took over the investigation.

278
00:28:27.437 --> 00:28:32.191
There is widespread speculation
that the Skuratovs were poisoned.

279
00:28:32.271 --> 00:28:34.911
Military toxicologists
have concluded,

280
00:28:34.937 --> 00:28:38.391
that the Kremlin was most
likely responsible

281
00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:43.232
for this heinous act of terrorism
on American soil.

282
00:28:43.258 --> 00:28:45.001
Lees, pack your stuff, please.

283
00:28:45.958 --> 00:28:47.102
What?

284
00:28:48.434 --> 00:28:49.647
We're leaving.

285
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:51.836
Why do we have to leave?

286
00:28:53.032 --> 00:28:55.307
Dad?
Just do as I say, okay?

287
00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.035
I don't want to leave.
I want to stay here.

288
00:28:59.659 --> 00:29:02.148
Why is it always about...
I haven't got time to argue with you!

289
00:29:02.182 --> 00:29:03.505
Just pack your stuff!

290
00:29:21.913 --> 00:29:23.004
Humm!...

291
00:29:56.274 --> 00:29:57.543
Bring him here.

292
00:30:28.063 --> 00:30:29.319
Wonderful.

293
00:30:29.764 --> 00:30:32.785
Perfect profile
for a secret agent.

294
00:31:13.576 --> 00:31:14.759
Ah!...

295
00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.299
Ah! Ah!...

296
00:31:45.329 --> 00:31:48.675
All right, slow down.
Just slow down, okay? You...

297
00:31:49.457 --> 00:31:52.112
Whatever you wanna know...
I want the files.

298
00:31:58.022 --> 00:32:00.120
What files?
What are you talking about?

299
00:32:01.158 --> 00:32:03.129
I don't know what files!
Ah!

300
00:32:03.183 --> 00:32:04.303
Ah!...

301
00:32:06.814 --> 00:32:07.872
Oh!...

302
00:32:09.565 --> 00:32:10.669
Fuck!...

303
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.567
Where does she hide them?

304
00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.757
You've got the fucking files!

305
00:32:19.864 --> 00:32:22.531
I saw the guy take the shoulder bag
with my own fucking eyes!

306
00:32:22.557 --> 00:32:23.908
You've got the files!

307
00:32:24.268 --> 00:32:27.018
No! No! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No! Ah!...

308
00:32:28.526 --> 00:32:29.613
Fuck!...

309
00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:32.076
Ah! Maybe this...

310
00:32:32.755 --> 00:32:35.022
refreshes your memory.

311
00:32:49.077 --> 00:32:51.734
Okay, okay.

312
00:32:54.324 --> 00:32:57.313
Sasha knows where the files are.
I can get them for you.

313
00:32:58.265 --> 00:32:59.910
She thinks I'm a journalist.

314
00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:03.462
I used to work with her father.
You know that, right?

315
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.335
I can get you files.

316
00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.356
You will get them.
Yes.

317
00:33:18.965 --> 00:33:22.467
The files and the journalist.
24 hours.

318
00:33:26.976 --> 00:33:29.964
I want the files
and the reporter.

319
00:33:32.205 --> 00:33:34.667
Dead or alive, I don't care.

320
00:33:35.482 --> 00:33:38.920
You've got 24 hours.

321
00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:46.535
Ah!...

322
00:34:10.273 --> 00:34:11.708
You will get her out.

323
00:34:12.097 --> 00:34:15.791
Promise me. Promise me.
Promise me.

324
00:34:59.675 --> 00:35:00.751
Lees.

325
00:35:02.236 --> 00:35:05.164
Your father is collecting
a present for me.

326
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.744
If you are nice,
we will be nice.

327
00:35:11.535 --> 00:35:13.558
You can order all candy,

328
00:35:13.584 --> 00:35:15.647
chips, soda you want, okay?

329
00:35:19.469 --> 00:35:21.070
I want a berry smoothie.

330
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.561
Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries
and two cups of spinach.

331
00:35:28.951 --> 00:35:31.091
Bring her a berry smoothie.

332
00:35:34.647 --> 00:35:36.284
Do you like cartoons?

333
00:35:56.853 --> 00:35:59.987
He's just parked
at Shaftesbury Avenue, Soho.

334
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.557
Maxi Million Club.

335
00:36:10.558 --> 00:36:13.467
He's in.
Go check it out.

336
00:36:15.834 --> 00:36:18.800
When I tell you I'm out,
that means I'm out.

337
00:36:31.967 --> 00:36:33.659
Hey, mate.
Hey.

338
00:36:33.893 --> 00:36:37.123
Maxim around?
Who's asking?

339
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.708
Tell him Bully Boy's
here to see him.

340
00:36:44.036 --> 00:36:46.067
Wow. Bully Boy.

341
00:36:48.431 --> 00:36:49.523
Have a seat.

342
00:36:52.104 --> 00:36:54.867
Cognac? I'm good.

343
00:36:58.195 --> 00:37:02.600
So, what brings you down here
in the middle of the night?

344
00:37:04.289 --> 00:37:06.165
Are we okay to talk business?

345
00:37:07.096 --> 00:37:08.634
Yeah, sure.

346
00:37:09.987 --> 00:37:11.118
Go ahead.

347
00:37:11.535 --> 00:37:15.167
I got a fight coming up
with this Armenian guy.

348
00:37:15.689 --> 00:37:18.353
And the funny thing is that
the Russians are talking about

349
00:37:18.379 --> 00:37:20.953
the Armenian guy kicking
the bucket during the bout.

350
00:37:22.126 --> 00:37:25.099
Bucket kicking?
Like, you mean...

351
00:37:25.534 --> 00:37:26.548
On?

352
00:37:29.289 --> 00:37:31.552
Apparently, there's a girl
mixed up in this as well.

353
00:37:31.578 --> 00:37:35.655
Ukrainian girl, blonde hair,
phoenix tattoo on her neck.

354
00:37:35.681 --> 00:37:37.341
Says she's a journalist.

355
00:37:37.536 --> 00:37:39.167
Know anything about that?

356
00:37:40.648 --> 00:37:42.109
Why should I know about her?

357
00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:46.509
Well, because I found this.

358
00:37:47.764 --> 00:37:48.939
In her wallet.

359
00:37:56.559 --> 00:37:57.657
So?

360
00:37:58.981 --> 00:38:01.526
So I think it's about time
you quit the bullshit, Maxim.

361
00:38:01.552 --> 00:38:02.643
Don't you? Where is she?

362
00:38:02.779 --> 00:38:05.012
I don't like your tone, Bully Boy.

363
00:38:07.232 --> 00:38:09.696
Sit down. Calm down.

364
00:38:10.334 --> 00:38:12.740
How the fuck did you
get that in here?

365
00:38:14.795 --> 00:38:18.253
Came to see you, didn't she?
That's how she found me.

366
00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.540
You are a dead man walking.

367
00:38:23.765 --> 00:38:25.021
Get your phone out.

368
00:38:27.162 --> 00:38:30.110
Get your fucking phone out.
I'm not gonna ask you again. Do it.

369
00:38:50.579 --> 00:38:51.636
Ah!...

370
00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:13.348
Ah!...

371
00:39:42.455 --> 00:39:46.018
Look at that. He's in close,
but he can't get a punch in,

372
00:39:46.044 --> 00:39:48.968
so he ties his opponent's arms
and pushes him back at the same time.

373
00:39:49.532 --> 00:39:51.600
See how he pushes Spence
back on the ropes?

374
00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:54.209
A lot of fighters get uncomfortable
in that situation,

375
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.057
especially Shawn Spence.

376
00:40:05.813 --> 00:40:08.433
So you think
this Smokin' Joe will win?

377
00:40:08.667 --> 00:40:10.624
Oh, yeah. I'd put cash on him,

378
00:40:10.978 --> 00:40:13.242
70/30 odds, at least.

379
00:40:13.939 --> 00:40:15.022
There he goes.

380
00:40:15.436 --> 00:40:17.634
Oh! That hurt!

381
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.767
What did I tell you?
Wish I'd put money on that.

382
00:40:25.779 --> 00:40:27.287
You put money?

383
00:41:08.908 --> 00:41:10.267
I'm here to help you.

384
00:41:14.456 --> 00:41:15.820
Your father was my friend.

385
00:41:15.846 --> 00:41:17.927
I'm not gonna let
the same thing happen to you.

386
00:41:18.307 --> 00:41:20.300
Give me your phone.
Why?

387
00:41:22.052 --> 00:41:23.519
How do you think I found you?

388
00:41:25.399 --> 00:41:27.904
Take this. It's safe.

389
00:41:32.058 --> 00:41:33.833
You do know what we're up
against, right?

390
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:36.704
They don't scare me.

391
00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:39.545
I want those files published.

392
00:41:41.045 --> 00:41:42.691
To avenge your father's death?

393
00:41:44.011 --> 00:41:46.845
Yes. And all the others.

394
00:41:53.884 --> 00:41:55.229
I found his log book.

395
00:41:55.637 --> 00:41:57.230
The last entry was about
a meeting

396
00:41:57.256 --> 00:41:58.756
with a woman he called
Red Star.

397
00:42:01.248 --> 00:42:02.988
Red Star had collected evidence

398
00:42:03.014 --> 00:42:04.579
of a chemical weapons program.

399
00:42:04.717 --> 00:42:07.188
She had gotten hold
of the formula for Novichok.

400
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.967
She even had samples of it.

401
00:42:11.277 --> 00:42:13.033
Your father didn't tell me that.

402
00:42:14.454 --> 00:42:16.311
Red Star thought it
was too risky to bring

403
00:42:16.337 --> 00:42:18.396
the files to the meeting,
so she put them in a bank.

404
00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.622
She put them in a bank?
Yes.

405
00:42:22.692 --> 00:42:26.335
Where is this bank, Sasha?
I'm the only one who knows.

406
00:42:28.282 --> 00:42:30.353
The address of the bank
was in his log book.

407
00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.690
I burned it.

408
00:42:36.756 --> 00:42:39.214
You have
the address of the bank, right?

409
00:42:39.461 --> 00:42:42.860
Red Star wanted to give my father
the code to the safe deposit box.

410
00:42:43.114 --> 00:42:44.396
Do you have the code?

411
00:42:45.073 --> 00:42:48.335
Shit. Very smart.

412
00:42:50.098 --> 00:42:51.960
I need your help
to get the code.

413
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.024
For fuck's sake,
taking a nap while on duty?

414
00:43:12.581 --> 00:43:13.708
Let it ring.

415
00:43:14.652 --> 00:43:16.334
Turn around,
don't you look at me.

416
00:43:17.026 --> 00:43:18.321
Let me see your hands.

417
00:43:19.835 --> 00:43:22.599
Who are you?
Don't you worry about that.

418
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.307
Log into the CIA system.

419
00:43:26.037 --> 00:43:28.320
We're just a trading company.
Don't know what you think...

420
00:43:28.346 --> 00:43:30.148
If you don't want me
to blow your brains out

421
00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:32.136
all over this nice monitor,
I'd do as you're told.

422
00:43:40.586 --> 00:43:42.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What you doing?

423
00:43:42.106 --> 00:43:44.755
What you doing?
I know your game.

424
00:43:45.536 --> 00:43:47.705
You got a real password
and a fake one, yeah?

425
00:43:48.324 --> 00:43:51.376
Let me suggest something.
Put the real one in.

426
00:43:56.499 --> 00:43:59.987
Okay. Operation Red Star.
I wanna see everything you've got.

427
00:44:04.436 --> 00:44:06.768
Keep going. 12 years ago, Kiev.

428
00:44:17.799 --> 00:44:18.896
Okay.

429
00:44:24.247 --> 00:44:25.441
All right, stop.

430
00:44:25.618 --> 00:44:29.002
There's a handwritten note.
Yellow handwritten note.

431
00:44:35.022 --> 00:44:37.237
Yeah?
A van just pulled up outside.

432
00:44:37.377 --> 00:44:39.843
Men with guns.
Get out of there.

433
00:44:43.248 --> 00:44:45.247
It's encrypted.
I don't have access.

434
00:44:48.634 --> 00:44:50.104
Print it. Everything.

435
00:44:56.407 --> 00:44:57.505
Is it printing or not?

436
00:44:57.531 --> 00:44:59.701
Yeah, it's coming.
Come on.

437
00:45:09.397 --> 00:45:10.694
Get up! Move!

438
00:45:11.007 --> 00:45:13.263
Where's the escape route?
The what?

439
00:45:13.289 --> 00:45:15.389
The fucking escape route!
On the back wall!

440
00:45:18.687 --> 00:45:20.388
Where is it? Stop!...

441
00:45:35.343 --> 00:45:36.491
Martin!

442
00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:45.090
What's going on?
I've got a hostage here.

443
00:45:47.149 --> 00:45:49.921
Martin, let's talk about this,
shall we?

444
00:45:51.117 --> 00:45:53.536
Come on. If you have a gun,
just put it down.

445
00:45:53.562 --> 00:45:55.205
We don't want
anyone getting hurt.

446
00:45:55.231 --> 00:45:56.297
You hear me?

447
00:45:58.066 --> 00:45:59.205
Martin?

448
00:46:02.162 --> 00:46:03.671
Martin, I'm coming in.

449
00:46:11.952 --> 00:46:13.740
Two! Down! Let's go.

450
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:47.339
Game over, mate.
Slowly up.

451
00:46:54.559 --> 00:46:55.605
Ah!...

452
00:47:19.774 --> 00:47:20.865
Ah!...

453
00:47:27.667 --> 00:47:28.858
Ah!...

454
00:48:02.565 --> 00:48:03.888
Ah!... Humm!...

455
00:48:29.793 --> 00:48:31.249
Ah!...
What do you want?

456
00:48:44.176 --> 00:48:45.745
Jig's up, Martin.

457
00:48:46.568 --> 00:48:48.696
Ah, ah!...

458
00:48:49.517 --> 00:48:50.605
Ah!...

459
00:48:57.051 --> 00:48:58.210
Ah!...

460
00:49:01.375 --> 00:49:02.581
One on him.

461
00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:08.684
What took you so long?
Drive.

462
00:49:38.901 --> 00:49:40.770
10 hours have passed.

463
00:49:43.919 --> 00:49:45.403
Turn up the pressure.

464
00:49:47.752 --> 00:49:49.335
Yes, I will comply.

465
00:49:54.237 --> 00:49:57.260
You're telling me MI6, CIA,
they're all after us?

466
00:49:59.597 --> 00:50:01.287
It's not even our main concern.

467
00:50:02.083 --> 00:50:03.207
Ah!...

468
00:50:14.187 --> 00:50:16.304
You're not like any reporter
I've ever met.

469
00:50:18.536 --> 00:50:20.148
That's 'cause I'm
the best, right?

470
00:50:21.288 --> 00:50:22.834
Isn't that what
your father said?

471
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.900
Fuck! What's wrong?

472
00:50:50.254 --> 00:50:51.685
They've changed the encryption.

473
00:51:00.836 --> 00:51:01.998
Martin!

474
00:51:03.954 --> 00:51:05.061
You're surrounded!

475
00:51:06.009 --> 00:51:07.956
Come out with your hands
above your head.

476
00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:09.554
We will use force.

477
00:51:13.312 --> 00:51:14.981
Final warning, Martin.

478
00:51:21.782 --> 00:51:24.337
Good. Very good.

479
00:51:25.284 --> 00:51:26.617
Now move forward.

480
00:51:29.488 --> 00:51:30.589
Slowly.

481
00:51:34.454 --> 00:51:36.409
Tell your men
to put their guns down.

482
00:51:36.523 --> 00:51:38.190
Do as I say or I'll kill him.

483
00:51:38.712 --> 00:51:41.381
The files you're looking for
are in a bank.

484
00:51:41.555 --> 00:51:44.044
Martin has the code
to the vault in his head.

485
00:51:44.588 --> 00:51:46.247
He's the only one who knows it.

486
00:51:47.334 --> 00:51:50.479
Now you tell me,
shall I blow his brains out?

487
00:51:50.505 --> 00:51:53.213
That would just break my heart
there, Sasha.

488
00:51:53.239 --> 00:51:56.147
Am I?
For chrissake, Trevor!

489
00:51:59.478 --> 00:52:01.863
Tell them to put their guns
down, now!

490
00:52:02.611 --> 00:52:04.606
Come on, please.

491
00:52:13.543 --> 00:52:15.774
I'm the only one who knows
the location of the bank.

492
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.844
Calm down.

493
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:19.351
Three...

494
00:52:22.745 --> 00:52:23.846
You're bluffing.

495
00:52:25.832 --> 00:52:27.871
Two...
Sasha. Sasha.

496
00:52:28.202 --> 00:52:29.337
What are you doing?

497
00:52:38.338 --> 00:52:39.803
One! Okay, okay.

498
00:52:57.537 --> 00:53:00.456
I told you, he wants those
files more than anything.

499
00:53:07.068 --> 00:53:08.134
Wake up!

500
00:53:13.545 --> 00:53:14.770
What did he want?

501
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:17.955
You guys seem to know
each other pretty well.

502
00:53:18.873 --> 00:53:19.978
Who?

503
00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:22.579
Don't play games with
me, Martin.

504
00:53:22.676 --> 00:53:24.389
You know who I'm talking about.

505
00:53:29.443 --> 00:53:33.816
He said it was a handwritten note.
Yellow paper.

506
00:53:34.524 --> 00:53:36.588
I could only print
the encrypted version.

507
00:53:37.297 --> 00:53:39.253
I'm sure you got
a lot of questions, Sasha,

508
00:53:39.279 --> 00:53:41.345
but you're just gonna
have to trust me, okay?

509
00:53:41.777 --> 00:53:43.749
When was the encryption
last updated?

510
00:53:43.775 --> 00:53:46.892
Uh, six months ago.
Huh. Ok!...

511
00:53:47.068 --> 00:53:49.048
Then he doesn't have
what he was looking for.

512
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.307
Look, believe me,
I'm as scared as you are.

513
00:53:53.333 --> 00:53:54.570
I'm not scared.

514
00:53:55.648 --> 00:53:57.587
Did anyone ever follow up
on this?

515
00:53:57.623 --> 00:54:00.706
Yeah, but the number is not
registered to any network.

516
00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:11.110
Hey, mate. Fancy a joyride?

517
00:54:12.464 --> 00:54:15.898
Not a phone number.
The fucking code to the vault.

518
00:54:15.924 --> 00:54:16.956
Print it out.

519
00:54:18.598 --> 00:54:19.842
What do we do now?

520
00:54:24.468 --> 00:54:26.729
Got a credit card?
Yes.

521
00:54:26.916 --> 00:54:28.097
Get it out.

522
00:54:29.014 --> 00:54:30.477
Time to set a trap.

523
00:54:30.893 --> 00:54:32.329
A trap? Yes.

524
00:54:32.355 --> 00:54:33.787
Trevor's got the code
to the vault.

525
00:54:33.813 --> 00:54:35.667
So let's lead him
to the honeypot.

526
00:54:36.512 --> 00:54:39.258
Give me status.
He's close.

527
00:54:50.442 --> 00:54:51.537
We've lost him.

528
00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:06.969
Oh, sorry! Excuse me.

529
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:09.720
Sorry, I really wasn't looking
where I was going, was I?

530
00:55:09.746 --> 00:55:10.808
Sorry.

531
00:55:20.196 --> 00:55:23.094
It's British.
Gonna be all right with that?

532
00:55:28.034 --> 00:55:29.138
We got a hit.

533
00:55:29.889 --> 00:55:32.005
Sasha just booked two
tickets to Moscow.

534
00:55:33.094 --> 00:55:35.994
A hotel in the city center.
I'll make some calls.

535
00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.428
Don't bother,
they're not going to Moscow.

536
00:55:38.454 --> 00:55:39.781
He's not that stupid.

537
00:55:42.091 --> 00:55:45.400
Check all outbound flights from every
airport within a hundred mile radius

538
00:55:45.426 --> 00:55:47.649
for a passenger named
Sasha Stepanenko.

539
00:55:47.675 --> 00:55:50.263
Check the trains too.
What about Martin?

540
00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.847
You seriously think he'd travel
under his own name?

541
00:55:59.579 --> 00:56:02.106
Give me all the
security camera footage

542
00:56:02.132 --> 00:56:03.915
from every airport in London.

543
00:56:16.223 --> 00:56:18.655
That's pretty. Is it really yours?

544
00:56:19.257 --> 00:56:20.417
Your bracelet.

545
00:56:34.078 --> 00:56:38.443
It is now clear that Sergei
Skuratov and his wife Yulia

546
00:56:38.469 --> 00:56:41.603
were poisoned
by a military grade nerve agent

547
00:56:41.636 --> 00:56:44.967
of a type Russia
has developed in the past.

548
00:56:45.624 --> 00:56:49.050
It's one of a group of nerve agents
known as Novichok.

549
00:56:49.276 --> 00:56:51.604
I hope you have
good news for me.

550
00:56:52.031 --> 00:56:53.624
I know where the files are.

551
00:56:53.798 --> 00:56:57.304
I'm gonna need more time.
Listen, if you're trying to trick me,

552
00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:59.483
you will not win.
You understand me?

553
00:56:59.927 --> 00:57:02.248
Nobody's trying
to trick anyone here, okay?

554
00:57:02.274 --> 00:57:05.086
The files are in Kiev.
Sasha is taking me there now.

555
00:57:05.112 --> 00:57:07.086
We're close.
I just need a little more time.

556
00:57:07.112 --> 00:57:09.258
How do I know this is true?
Sure!...

557
00:57:10.551 --> 00:57:12.160
Well, do you want
the files or not?

558
00:57:13.982 --> 00:57:15.834
Say hello to your father.

559
00:57:17.231 --> 00:57:19.908
Dad?
Sweetheart, you all right?

560
00:57:20.161 --> 00:57:21.269
How are you doing?

561
00:57:21.815 --> 00:57:24.987
Okay, I guess.
I'm having a pedicure.

562
00:57:25.171 --> 00:57:26.916
When will you come?
That's enough.

563
00:57:28.356 --> 00:57:31.240
I want to speak
to him more. He misses me.

564
00:57:32.928 --> 00:57:33.959
Ah!...

565
00:57:35.156 --> 00:57:36.854
I'm sure he does.

566
00:57:38.041 --> 00:57:39.835
You have no children, do you?

567
00:57:42.427 --> 00:57:44.480
If you were a mother,
you wouldn't do this.

568
00:57:45.796 --> 00:57:47.440
You think you know me?

569
00:57:51.101 --> 00:57:53.017
If you had kids,
I bet they'd hate you.

570
00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:01.064
You think you are
an intelligent girl, right?

571
00:58:03.983 --> 00:58:04.988
Good!...

572
00:58:05.014 --> 00:58:08.042
Let me tell you a story about
your father and your mother.

573
00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:11.530
You know what he did?

574
00:58:13.717 --> 00:58:16.919
Your father told her he was a journalist.

575
00:58:18.091 --> 00:58:22.249
He pretended to love her,
but he was really a spy.

576
00:58:24.659 --> 00:58:29.475
So my question is, intelligent girl,
what are you for him?

577
00:58:30.734 --> 00:58:32.337
Accident, maybe?

578
00:58:33.523 --> 00:58:35.256
Or maybe you good for cover.

579
00:58:35.282 --> 00:58:37.930
You don't know shit.
I was born out of love.

580
00:58:37.956 --> 00:58:40.630
He told me.
Okay, we are finished.

581
00:58:41.666 --> 00:58:43.689
We can't be late for the fight.

582
00:58:46.999 --> 00:58:49.250
Bingo!
They're on a flight to Kiev.

583
00:58:51.927 --> 00:58:53.111
All right.

584
00:58:53.535 --> 00:58:55.812
Get in touch with our
Ukrainian friends.

585
00:58:58.994 --> 00:59:01.830
Ask for Colonel Zelenko,
send him that picture.

586
00:59:01.856 --> 00:59:04.871
Tell him I want him
to keep a close eye on them.

587
00:59:04.994 --> 00:59:06.930
Come on, get your ass in gear.
Let's go.

588
00:59:20.643 --> 00:59:23.055
Greetings!
How can I help you?

589
00:59:23.101 --> 00:59:24.609
We'd like to rent a car.

590
00:59:34.941 --> 00:59:36.357
Exact match.

591
01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:16.163
Is something wrong?

592
01:00:19.265 --> 01:00:21.135
I haven't been
here since he died.

593
01:00:36.685 --> 01:00:40.407
We ended our chemical
weapons program in 1992.

594
01:00:40.575 --> 01:00:44.060
We eliminated all the chemical
weapons that existed in Russia.

595
01:00:44.086 --> 01:00:45.091
Martin, look.

596
01:00:45.706 --> 01:00:48.260
But at the same time
we are very suspicious

597
01:00:48.286 --> 01:00:52.236
of everything that's happened
around this provocation against Russia.

598
01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.933
And naturally,
we want to know the truth.

599
01:00:56.121 --> 01:00:59.372
The Russians' position in this case
is becoming increasingly bizarre.

600
01:00:59.398 --> 01:01:00.989
You know what the next step is?

601
01:01:01.478 --> 01:01:03.553
They're gonna start blaming
the Americans.

602
01:01:07.724 --> 01:01:09.476
You remind me of my father.

603
01:01:18.195 --> 01:01:20.077
Your father
was a very brave man.

604
01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:22.709
And very stubborn.

605
01:01:26.357 --> 01:01:27.640
Little bit like you.

606
01:01:33.701 --> 01:01:35.121
Why did you leave Kiev?

607
01:01:43.616 --> 01:01:45.139
I lost someone too.

608
01:01:47.949 --> 01:01:49.027
A woman?

609
01:01:57.019 --> 01:01:58.100
She died?

610
01:02:10.429 --> 01:02:13.875
Never get personally involved
during a mission, Martin.

611
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.528
That leads to failure, remember?

612
01:02:17.175 --> 01:02:18.670
We don't want that.

613
01:02:26.794 --> 01:02:28.152
You were right.

614
01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.368
He won with a knockout
in the third round.

615
01:02:33.173 --> 01:02:34.635
How do you know that?

616
01:02:37.516 --> 01:02:39.098
What happened to my mother?

617
01:02:40.472 --> 01:02:41.833
Forget about that.

618
01:02:42.975 --> 01:02:45.977
No, tell me. I want to know.

619
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:50.870
I can't tell you.
You should ask your father.

620
01:02:53.392 --> 01:02:54.495
Tell me.

621
01:02:58.949 --> 01:03:01.904
Your mother was
in a dangerous situation.

622
01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:04.949
Your father tried to save her.

623
01:03:06.657 --> 01:03:09.446
She got hit. Hit?

624
01:03:10.456 --> 01:03:13.354
By a bullet. Who did it?

625
01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:19.915
Did he?

626
01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:24.954
It was an accident, Lees.

627
01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:49.439
Sorry, I can't
get to the phone right now,

628
01:04:49.465 --> 01:04:50.951
but please leave a message.

629
01:04:51.123 --> 01:04:53.870
I'm in Kiev,
waiting for your call.

630
01:05:20.111 --> 01:05:21.815
So far, so good.

631
01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:27.736
You sure you're ready for this?

632
01:05:59.746 --> 01:06:01.894
Hello! How can I help you?

633
01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.870
I'd like to access
my deposit box in the vault.

634
01:06:04.414 --> 01:06:05.900
Your documents, please.

635
01:06:11.068 --> 01:06:12.234
Just a moment.

636
01:06:18.915 --> 01:06:21.643
Hello, Ms. Stepanenko.
Please follow me.

637
01:06:32.717 --> 01:06:34.080
Good morning.

638
01:06:42.383 --> 01:06:44.443
Good morning.
Please unlock the door.

639
01:07:12.956 --> 01:07:16.897
First fill in the box
number, then your code.

640
01:07:17.303 --> 01:07:18.893
I'll leave you to it.

641
01:07:18.919 --> 01:07:21.883
If you need any assistance,
please call me.

642
01:07:21.909 --> 01:07:24.153
Thanks.
You have 15 minutes.

643
01:07:31.153 --> 01:07:33.725
First corridor on the left
after the security gates,

644
01:07:33.751 --> 01:07:36.622
then down the stairs,
second right, then third right.

645
01:07:36.649 --> 01:07:38.337
There's a security guard.
Yeah.

646
01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:41.055
Looks like the bait worked,
stay where you are.

647
01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.712
Take me to the safe deposit box.

648
01:07:45.738 --> 01:07:46.929
What happened?

649
01:07:47.149 --> 01:07:49.847
Take me to the safe deposit box.

650
01:07:50.842 --> 01:07:53.295
Sure. Follow me.

651
01:07:53.493 --> 01:07:54.760
Your pass, please.

652
01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.042
You can't come in without a pass.

653
01:07:57.535 --> 01:07:58.637
Stop!

654
01:07:59.494 --> 01:08:01.084
Ah, ah!...Do not do it!...

655
01:08:04.764 --> 01:08:07.593
What's going on? We'll take care
of it, sir. It won't take long.

656
01:08:07.619 --> 01:08:09.149
Whoa, whoa. Show me the vault.

657
01:08:09.175 --> 01:08:11.825
But there's an emergency, sir.
Take me to the fucking vault.

658
01:08:25.842 --> 01:08:29.050
I'll take it from here.
Stay here.

659
01:08:31.153 --> 01:08:33.555
Nice of you to turn up
to the picnic, Trevor.

660
01:08:36.231 --> 01:08:37.761
Well, well, well.

661
01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.822
You're getting predictable,
buddy.

662
01:08:41.583 --> 01:08:43.482
Put the gun on her
and shoot her if you have to.

663
01:08:43.508 --> 01:08:44.513
Get inside.

664
01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:48.890
Nice of you to bring it
in person, Trevor.

665
01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:52.069
Punch in the code.
I know you've got it on you.

666
01:08:52.506 --> 01:08:56.066
You give me too much credit.
You want me to feel you up?

667
01:08:57.515 --> 01:08:58.697
What is it, Martin?

668
01:08:59.650 --> 01:09:01.313
Quick trade with the Russians?

669
01:09:02.983 --> 01:09:05.557
A little revenge
on your former employer?

670
01:09:05.701 --> 01:09:07.407
What? Just do it.

671
01:09:12.619 --> 01:09:16.302
Your new girlfriend, she recruited you
to the people's cause.

672
01:09:18.262 --> 01:09:20.764
Cozy little bedtime
publishing deal?

673
01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:23.128
Look, enough of your bullshit.
Just open it.

674
01:09:41.945 --> 01:09:43.550
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

675
01:09:43.931 --> 01:09:46.612
What if it's set as a trap?
Think about it.

676
01:09:47.133 --> 01:09:50.478
Red Star was FSB.
What if she wanted to fuck us over?

677
01:09:51.237 --> 01:09:54.259
Stop!
There's Novichok inside!

678
01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.493
Sasha? We good?

679
01:10:09.476 --> 01:10:10.839
Tell them to back up!

680
01:10:11.193 --> 01:10:12.978
All the way down the hallway!

681
01:10:13.165 --> 01:10:15.104
Do it or I'll fucking kill him!

682
01:10:17.348 --> 01:10:19.594
You just signed
your own death warrant, man.

683
01:10:20.469 --> 01:10:22.609
Agency's gonna have
a hard-on for you.

684
01:10:22.642 --> 01:10:25.347
You think so, do you?
I'll take my chances.

685
01:10:25.772 --> 01:10:28.922
Hey, Sasha.
You trust this guy?

686
01:10:29.533 --> 01:10:30.884
Like your father did?

687
01:10:30.921 --> 01:10:32.962
You know, 12 years...
Ooh!

688
01:10:49.738 --> 01:10:50.952
This way.

689
01:12:18.521 --> 01:12:20.697
This looks bad.
It's a scratch.

690
01:12:20.789 --> 01:12:22.944
Bullet went straight through.
I was lucky.

691
01:12:23.408 --> 01:12:25.983
Ukrainian medicine,
best there is.

692
01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.581
This might sting a bit,
but you're a big boy, right?

693
01:12:28.607 --> 01:12:30.452
Yah!... Do it. Ah!...

694
01:12:32.926 --> 01:12:34.457
Sasha, what are you doing?

695
01:12:35.168 --> 01:12:36.279
You're one of them.

696
01:12:36.305 --> 01:12:37.876
I can explain.
Don't move.

697
01:12:38.523 --> 01:12:39.708
I swear I'll shoot you.

698
01:12:39.734 --> 01:12:42.616
If you shoot me,
you're gonna Kill my daughter too.

699
01:12:43.606 --> 01:12:44.930
The Russians have got her.

700
01:12:45.952 --> 01:12:47.232
Ah!...
Don't move!

701
01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.169
You're full of shit.
It's the truth.

702
01:12:55.366 --> 01:12:59.068
I need those files, okay?
My daughter's life depends on it.

703
01:12:59.094 --> 01:13:01.547
I know you want to expose the
people that killed your father.

704
01:13:01.573 --> 01:13:03.871
And I get that, I really do.

705
01:13:04.362 --> 01:13:06.642
But do the ends justify
the means?

706
01:13:07.166 --> 01:13:08.982
You seriously think I believe you?

707
01:13:09.879 --> 01:13:11.718
Just ask yourself this, okay?

708
01:13:12.617 --> 01:13:14.765
Would your father sacrifice
the life of a little girl?

709
01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:16.506
You don't know shit about
my father!

710
01:13:16.638 --> 01:13:17.691
Oh!

711
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:45.938
 Never get personally
involved during the mission.

712
01:13:47.665 --> 01:13:51.427
You will get her out.
We don't want that.

713
01:13:51.714 --> 01:13:54.223
Promise me? Promise me?

714
01:13:58.881 --> 01:14:01.991
That leads to failure.
Olga?

715
01:14:03.752 --> 01:14:07.324
We don't want that, failure.
Olga.

716
01:14:13.203 --> 01:14:14.383
Failure.

717
01:14:34.783 --> 01:14:37.708
Yeah? Martin.

718
01:14:39.409 --> 01:14:41.096
You have what I want?

719
01:14:44.934 --> 01:14:46.162
Yeah.

720
01:14:47.131 --> 01:14:48.752
Yeah, I've got what you want.

721
01:14:48.922 --> 01:14:51.356
Files and reporter?

722
01:14:52.323 --> 01:14:55.732
Yeah.
Yeah, I wanna talk to Lees.

723
01:14:57.764 --> 01:15:01.263
Here, talk to your father.
Dad.

724
01:15:04.761 --> 01:15:06.284
When are you coming to get me?

725
01:15:13.145 --> 01:15:14.667
I love you, sweetheart.

726
01:15:17.441 --> 01:15:19.667
Dad, you sound weird.

727
01:15:29.415 --> 01:15:31.600
Just don't ever forget
that I love you, all right?

728
01:15:34.148 --> 01:15:37.570
Dad? You're worrying me.

729
01:15:39.195 --> 01:15:42.231
All right, Martin.
We meet at 10pm.

730
01:15:42.257 --> 01:15:43.899
No funny games.

731
01:16:02.128 --> 01:16:03.256
Ah!...

732
01:16:25.808 --> 01:16:27.796
Why do you always have
to ruin my day?

733
01:16:31.182 --> 01:16:32.833
Trevor, I need your help.

734
01:16:33.997 --> 01:16:36.299
Martin Baxtor, asking for help?

735
01:16:37.783 --> 01:16:40.686
This is a treat.
They've got her.

736
01:16:40.712 --> 01:16:43.507
The Russians have got Lisa,
and they're gonna kill her.

737
01:16:43.823 --> 01:16:47.312
If I don't get the case to them
by 10pm tonight, she's dead.

738
01:16:49.731 --> 01:16:50.960
Where's the case?

739
01:16:53.725 --> 01:16:55.657
She fucked you over, didn't she?

740
01:16:57.495 --> 01:16:59.740
And now you want me
to help you,

741
01:17:00.264 --> 01:17:02.622
get it back and give it
to the Russians?

742
01:17:18.128 --> 01:17:19.782
Deal is still on the table.

743
01:17:20.926 --> 01:17:22.771
But you know how
the game is played.

744
01:17:24.543 --> 01:17:26.034
Tell me where you are.

745
01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.844
Martin?

746
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:50.014
Miss.
I need to know if you have got

747
01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.283
a tracking device
installed in your vehicles.

748
01:17:51.309 --> 01:17:52.982
In this case, we should call...
Please, calm down.

749
01:17:53.008 --> 01:17:55.398
Are there tracking devices
installed in the vehicles? Ah!...

750
01:17:55.424 --> 01:17:57.632
Tell me where the fucking
thing is now! Okay!

751
01:17:57.992 --> 01:18:00.754
In the name of Tyner.
Alison Jane Tyner.

752
01:18:01.001 --> 01:18:03.694
It's parked at Pasazhyrskyi,
the central train station.

753
01:18:30.776 --> 01:18:31.904
Move!

754
01:18:35.001 --> 01:18:36.162
Sasha!

755
01:18:38.039 --> 01:18:39.235
Sorry.

756
01:19:07.151 --> 01:19:09.076
Ah!, ah!...

757
01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:14.898
Ah!...
Shh! Shh! Shh!

758
01:19:15.185 --> 01:19:18.401
Shh! Shh! Shh!

759
01:19:18.659 --> 01:19:20.754
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

760
01:19:39.178 --> 01:19:41.403
You've done well, Martin.

761
01:19:42.189 --> 01:19:45.798
You've used all your skills
to get what we want.

762
01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:53.276
I know you have feelings
for the reporter.

763
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:55.976
But she's not important.

764
01:19:56.987 --> 01:19:59.081
Just collateral damage.

765
01:19:59.647 --> 01:20:02.375
Testing, testing. Check, check.
Do you hear that?

766
01:20:03.961 --> 01:20:05.153
Testing.

767
01:20:18.695 --> 01:20:20.533
What is important is you,

768
01:20:20.743 --> 01:20:23.518
our daughter, and our mission.

769
01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:29.636
I love you so much, Martin.

770
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:04.956
I'm not armed.

771
01:21:10.339 --> 01:21:13.027
I'm gonna get my phone
out of my pocket, okay?

772
01:21:13.226 --> 01:21:15.985
What did I tell you?
No fucking games.

773
01:21:16.402 --> 01:21:17.986
I'm gonna send you a link.

774
01:21:20.443 --> 01:21:23.070
It's a link to a video stream.
Just open it.

775
01:21:26.719 --> 01:21:28.618
The files are in that case.

776
01:21:29.158 --> 01:21:31.696
Once Lisa is safe,
I'll send you the address.

777
01:21:37.775 --> 01:21:39.160
She can hear you.

778
01:21:42.146 --> 01:21:43.342
Sasha.

779
01:21:44.225 --> 01:21:47.198
I heard you have
a nice present for me.

780
01:22:04.537 --> 01:22:06.859
It was the bracelet
of my daughter.

781
01:22:09.984 --> 01:22:11.258
What does it say?

782
01:22:14.074 --> 01:22:15.338
Masha.

783
01:22:23.693 --> 01:22:24.982
Thank you.

784
01:22:35.342 --> 01:22:38.644
Now go.
Take her to him!

785
01:22:46.086 --> 01:22:50.069
It's all gonna be over soon,
sweetheart. I promise.

786
01:22:57.712 --> 01:22:58.987
He's clean!

787
01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:16.315
Saksahanskoho Street 97, first floor.

788
01:23:21.273 --> 01:23:22.945
You go together.

789
01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:53.611
Now!

790
01:23:54.914 --> 01:23:56.066
Move!

791
01:24:03.287 --> 01:24:04.394
Ah!...

792
01:24:05.846 --> 01:24:07.222
Stay down!

793
01:24:25.562 --> 01:24:28.061
She is empty. What?

794
01:24:28.501 --> 01:24:29.948
She's out of bullets.

795
01:24:40.866 --> 01:24:42.414
You all right, sweetheart?

796
01:24:53.654 --> 01:24:55.668
Martin, you know what I want.

797
01:25:11.512 --> 01:25:13.896
I've got it!
Don't do it, Martin!

798
01:25:13.922 --> 01:25:15.407
Shut the fuck up!
Publish the files!

799
01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.697
No matter what happens to me...

800
01:25:36.777 --> 01:25:39.005
you stay here, all right,
sweetheart?

801
01:25:40.632 --> 01:25:42.273
Dad, no. Don't.

802
01:25:47.859 --> 01:25:49.200
You stay here.

803
01:25:57.227 --> 01:25:59.817
Dad! Stop!

804
01:26:02.142 --> 01:26:03.433
Let her go,

805
01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.246
and I'll throw you the case!
Throw me the fuckin' files!

806
01:26:07.272 --> 01:26:08.430
Don't do it!

807
01:26:14.859 --> 01:26:16.356
Ah! Dad!

808
01:26:20.617 --> 01:26:23.236
Dad, Dad, my!

809
01:26:24.448 --> 01:26:28.134
On your knees.
I said on your knees!

810
01:26:31.829 --> 01:26:34.579
Say hi to your daddy.

811
01:27:00.744 --> 01:27:03.793
Lees, are you all right? Lees.

812
01:27:05.756 --> 01:27:07.416
We need to get him to a doctor.

813
01:27:25.901 --> 01:27:29.063
Sasha!
Hold out the case

814
01:27:29.352 --> 01:27:31.000
and walk over here slowly.

815
01:27:35.733 --> 01:27:37.577
There's no way out, Sasha.

816
01:30:20.096 --> 01:30:22.660
Hi Dad. Listen to me.

817
01:30:38.811 --> 01:30:39.959
Dad?

818
01:30:46.062 --> 01:30:47.302
Are you okay?

819
01:30:48.751 --> 01:30:49.960
I'm okay.

820
01:30:57.242 --> 01:30:59.201
I'm okay now, seeing you.

821
01:31:01.147 --> 01:31:05.133
So how they treating you?
Your foster mom?

822
01:31:05.458 --> 01:31:07.252
Good. Yeah?

823
01:31:07.371 --> 01:31:09.434
She makes me soup for lunch.

824
01:31:09.766 --> 01:31:13.237
Borscht. It's pretty good.

825
01:31:14.122 --> 01:31:15.653
I bought her a TV.

826
01:31:16.159 --> 01:31:18.458
And a laptop. Yeah?

827
01:31:18.728 --> 01:31:21.225
Her daughter Marina
lives in Moldavia.

828
01:31:21.439 --> 01:31:23.667
They can now talk online
to each other.

829
01:31:24.098 --> 01:31:27.534
Marina's really sweet.
Hang on a second.

830
01:31:28.605 --> 01:31:31.852
You bought her a TV and a laptop?

831
01:31:33.236 --> 01:31:34.762
Where'd you get that kind
of money?

832
01:31:34.788 --> 01:31:37.200
I earned it. You earned it?

833
01:31:37.670 --> 01:31:41.766
Well, that Russian lady,
she was kinda weird.

834
01:31:42.042 --> 01:31:43.512
She was crazy about gambling,

835
01:31:43.547 --> 01:31:45.377
but she didn't know
anything about boxing.

836
01:31:45.601 --> 01:31:48.572
So I offered my services, 50/50.

837
01:31:50.337 --> 01:31:53.167
You partnered up with her?
Yeah.

838
01:31:53.611 --> 01:31:55.914
I ran the numbers and
she put up the money.

839
01:31:56.130 --> 01:31:59.260
And we won...
a lot, actually.

840
01:32:04.781 --> 01:32:06.992
You always were the cleverest.

841
01:32:09.131 --> 01:32:10.738
Ah, come here.

842
01:32:12.739 --> 01:32:17.223
I've missed you. I missed you.

843
01:32:19.529 --> 01:32:22.290
Dad? Yeah?

844
01:32:23.937 --> 01:32:26.071
She told me what really
happened to Mom.

845
01:32:30.517 --> 01:32:32.267
She said you tried to save her.

846
01:32:35.875 --> 01:32:37.611
Ah, it was an accident.

847
01:32:40.823 --> 01:32:44.840
I just didn't know how
to tell you that.

848
01:32:49.523 --> 01:32:51.339
I didn't want you to hate me.

849
01:32:51.683 --> 01:32:54.543
It's okay, Dad, it's okay.

850
01:32:55.202 --> 01:32:57.632
I haven't been a very good
father, have I?

851
01:32:58.261 --> 01:32:59.575
You're not that bad.

852
01:33:00.088 --> 01:33:02.713
I love you.
I love you too.

853
01:33:02.957 --> 01:33:05.597
We're a team, remember?
You and me.

854
01:33:06.087 --> 01:33:09.347
We're a team. We are.

855
01:33:15.845 --> 01:33:17.897
Taxi for Boryspil Airport.

856
01:33:19.212 --> 01:33:21.736
Get me out
of this godforsaken place.

857
01:33:26.405 --> 01:33:27.568
Lees?

858
01:33:28.635 --> 01:33:29.814
You all right?

859
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:44.828
Does that name look familiar?

860
01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.217
That's just a copy.
The original is in a safe place.

861
01:33:48.291 --> 01:33:50.759
If anything happens
to me or my dad,

862
01:33:50.785 --> 01:33:52.624
it'll be sent
to all the right people.

863
01:33:55.897 --> 01:33:57.861
I know you'll find a way
to get him out of here.

864
01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.000
Dear Lees,
I hope you're doing fine

865
01:34:10.026 --> 01:34:12.200
and the foster mother
takes good care of you.

866
01:34:12.764 --> 01:34:15.769
I will always be grateful
to you for saving my life.

867
01:34:17.052 --> 01:34:18.854
Inside this envelope, you will find

868
01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:22.203
the name of the double agent
in the CIA-MI6 network.

869
01:34:22.775 --> 01:34:24.316
Please be careful.

870
01:34:24.791 --> 01:34:27.212
Remember,
when you live among wolves,

871
01:34:27.238 --> 01:34:28.665
you must behave like one.

872
01:34:30.499 --> 01:34:32.933
Your friend, Sasha Stepanenko.

873
01:34:43.522 --> 01:34:46.168
Online publication
of the files in Russia

874
01:34:46.381 --> 01:34:49.963
has led to the largest
public protests in years.

875
01:34:50.876 --> 01:34:52.472
Sasha Stepanenko,

876
01:34:52.498 --> 01:34:54.700
you've made these files public.

877
01:34:55.013 --> 01:34:56.838
The first response from the Kremlin

878
01:34:56.864 --> 01:34:59.496
is that the files are "fake news".

879
01:34:59.522 --> 01:35:02.947
What is your response to that?
If it's fake news,

880
01:35:03.265 --> 01:35:05.201
why don't they
permit inspections

881
01:35:05.236 --> 01:35:07.846
of the chemical weapons lab
in central Russia?

882
01:35:08.867 --> 01:35:10.971
It's like we're back
in Communist times.

883
01:35:11.670 --> 01:35:14.825
The extermination program
was focusing on opposition activists

884
01:35:14.851 --> 01:35:17.365
and journalists, like my father.

885
01:35:20.593 --> 01:35:22.801
But this isn't just
a Russian problem.

886
01:35:23.483 --> 01:35:27.034
The concept of objective truth
is being threatened everywhere.

887
01:35:27.697 --> 01:35:31.225
It is really important that we,
the international press,

888
01:35:31.251 --> 01:35:34.228
stand together
and unified for free speech.

889
01:35:34.856 --> 01:35:38.546
If not, lies will be our history.

890
01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:03.087
You all right, Lees?
Yeah

891
01:36:03.113 --> 01:36:05.155
You hungry? Yeah?
Yeah.

892
01:36:05.615 --> 01:36:08.906
So what about journalism?
It's a pretty cool profession, isn't it?

893
01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:12.112
I don't know,
it's mainly behind a desk.

894
01:36:12.147 --> 01:36:13.383
I mean, at the end of the day

895
01:36:13.409 --> 01:36:15.656
you're just gonna be stuck
behind a computer, aren't you?

896
01:36:15.682 --> 01:36:18.013
Yeah. But you get to travel,
get to meet people,

897
01:36:18.039 --> 01:36:19.813
things like that.
Travel?

898
01:36:19.839 --> 01:36:22.225
Yeah.
What's the pay like?

899
01:36:22.349 --> 01:36:24.989
Oh, come on, Lees!
It's not all about money, is it?

900
01:36:25.082 --> 01:36:27.909
could cover boxing.
Yeah, you could.

901
01:36:27.935 --> 01:36:31.037
And you could also cover,
I don't know, the National Ballet.

902
01:36:55.233 --> 01:36:57.805
Kitchen is closed.
We shut at 11.

903
01:36:58.642 --> 01:37:00.049
We're open again...

904
01:37:10.755 --> 01:37:14.155
Phoenix is in position.
Proceed with the operation.
