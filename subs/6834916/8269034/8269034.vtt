00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:43.908
<i>Red Star is on sight.</i>

2
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.075
<i>Headed due south.
Payload is on board.</i>

3
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.367
<i>Stepanenko has arrived.</i>

4
00:02:07.658 --> 00:02:08.950
Wait a second.

5
00:02:11.794 --> 00:02:13.794
You have the address of the bank, right?

6
00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:15.542
Yes.

7
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.117
Oh, shit.

8
00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:20.991
- You have the code?
- Here it is.

9
00:02:20.993 --> 00:02:22.993
Don't give this address to anyone.

10
00:02:23.575 --> 00:02:25.033
Stepanenko is not alone.

11
00:02:25.075 --> 00:02:26.700
<i>Repeat, he's not...</i>

12
00:02:33.908 --> 00:02:36.867
Red Star is down.
I need backup.

13
00:03:05.867 --> 00:03:07.117
They have the payload.

14
00:03:07.158 --> 00:03:09.075
<i>Where the fuck is my backup?</i>

15
00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:19.367
- Olga. It's me, it's me!
- No! No!

16
00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:21.492
- Martin?
- You okay?

17
00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:24.367
- What are you doing here?
- You stay in the car, don't move.

18
00:04:47.872 --> 00:04:49.706
Give me the bag.

19
00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:54.492
Throw me the bag.

20
00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:55.867
Let her go.

21
00:04:56.164 --> 00:04:57.839
Are you listening to me?

22
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.658
I'll throw the bag
when you let her go.

23
00:04:59.662 --> 00:05:01.662
I'll kill this bitch right now!

24
00:05:02.192 --> 00:05:03.567
Just listen to me, all right?

25
00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.849
You let her go,
and you walk away,

26
00:05:04.858 --> 00:05:06.525
that will be the end of it.

27
00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:08.483
But if you do not,
you are a dead man.

28
00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:11.533
Throw me the fucking bag!

29
00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.930
Come on!

30
00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:28.565
Come on, do it!

31
00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:01.117
Twenty minutes.
You all set?

32
00:06:01.158 --> 00:06:03.367
Yeah, I'm good.

33
00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:10.492
- What the hell is that?
- Avocado salad, low-fat yogurt.

34
00:06:10.533 --> 00:06:14.033
- I'm detoxing.
- You're detoxing. What for?

35
00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:17.033
- You're 12 years old.
- So amazing.

36
00:06:17.075 --> 00:06:18.950
You can clean out
your whole body.

37
00:06:18.992 --> 00:06:22.450
It works on your mind and
your feelings and your life.

38
00:06:22.492 --> 00:06:23.950
Everything changes
for the better.

39
00:06:23.992 --> 00:06:26.367
It's so powerful,
do you know what I mean?

40
00:06:29.575 --> 00:06:32.658
Sorry, am I boring you?

41
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.742
What did you say,
sweetheart?

42
00:06:35.867 --> 00:06:37.367
Never mind.

43
00:06:37.408 --> 00:06:40.367
Listen. This Richie May.

44
00:06:42.492 --> 00:06:45.033
He's got the range,
but you got the power.

45
00:06:45.075 --> 00:06:46.825
He's really tricky.

46
00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:49.867
He's gonna keep you dancing
at the end of his jab,

47
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:53.868
so you need to use your legs,
create space and bide your time.

48
00:06:53.908 --> 00:06:56.867
And when he gets tired,
move in for the knockout.

49
00:06:56.908 --> 00:07:01.783
Lees, I'm gonna do
what I always do, okay?

50
00:07:01.825 --> 00:07:04.867
I'm gonna walk him down,
smash straight through him.

51
00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:08.271
- I don't think that will work, Dad.
- Don't you worry about it, you leave it up to me.

52
00:07:12.033 --> 00:07:14.533
- You're sure?
- 'Course I'm sure.

53
00:07:14.575 --> 00:07:17.533
Anyway, what is this,
20 Questions? Go on.

54
00:07:31.908 --> 00:07:34.117
What are the odds
on the next match?

55
00:07:34.158 --> 00:07:37.117
Bully Boy, 2.8.
Richie May, 1.9.

56
00:07:37.158 --> 00:07:40.033
2.8 for the Bull?
You kidding me?

57
00:07:40.075 --> 00:07:42.396
Richie May won
the last K1 Grand Prix.

58
00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:44.942
He kicked the shit out of The Fly
and almost choked Garry Newman.

59
00:07:46.158 --> 00:07:48.300
Bully Boy should
be way over three.

60
00:07:48.324 --> 00:07:50.149
2.8 it is.

61
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.075
- What's the minimum bet?
- Fifty.

62
00:07:55.117 --> 00:07:57.825
Oh, you're a real high
roller, aren't you?

63
00:07:59.158 --> 00:08:02.075
Here's 500. Richie May.

64
00:08:32.492 --> 00:08:34.700
Are you ready?
Are you ready? Fight!

65
00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:02.533
Haymaker! Haymaker!

66
00:09:23.533 --> 00:09:25.992
He's got the range,
use your legs!

67
00:09:43.825 --> 00:09:46.033
Dad!

68
00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.967
Can you fight? Look at me.
Can you fight?

69
00:09:56.608 --> 00:09:59.192
Yeah!

70
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.575
Stop! Come on, Dad!
Come on!

71
00:10:11.617 --> 00:10:13.617
It's time to stop!

72
00:10:14.925 --> 00:10:16.133
Dad!

73
00:10:18.033 --> 00:10:21.075
Dad!

74
00:10:45.533 --> 00:10:47.450
You all right?

75
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.450
For the lady.

76
00:10:56.492 --> 00:10:59.867
Better luck next time,
Bully Boy.

77
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.617
What the fuck is that?

78
00:11:05.992 --> 00:11:07.575
Did you bet against me?

79
00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:09.759
I tried to warn you,

80
00:11:09.783 --> 00:11:11.458
but you were clearly not listening.

81
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.808
Why would you do that?

82
00:11:16.783 --> 00:11:19.617
I don't know what's
been up with you lately.

83
00:11:19.658 --> 00:11:22.117
You've just not
been... focused.

84
00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:26.867
Lees. Lees!

85
00:12:48.992 --> 00:12:51.033
Oh, my God, I gotta see you.

86
00:12:58.992 --> 00:13:01.033
Babe, are you all right?

87
00:13:08.033 --> 00:13:09.783
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to turn it on.

88
00:13:09.825 --> 00:13:12.408
Just go, all right?
Just go.

89
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.408
Baby.

90
00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.992
- Look, I'm sorry, I didn't...
- Just fucking leave!

91
00:13:17.033 --> 00:13:19.075
- Just go!
- All right.

92
00:14:00.533 --> 00:14:01.783
Ready?

93
00:14:03.908 --> 00:14:05.492
Remember what I told you.

94
00:14:07.575 --> 00:14:09.825
Dad, I've been thinking.
You like it here, right?

95
00:14:11.992 --> 00:14:13.533
It's all right.

96
00:14:14.742 --> 00:14:16.533
I'm tired of moving
all the time.

97
00:14:16.534 --> 00:14:17.909
I think we should
settle down here.

98
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.494
Open a restaurant or something.

99
00:14:19.533 --> 00:14:20.867
What do you think?

100
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.367
You know what I think, Lees.

101
00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:29.492
I think we should
keep moving. You know?

102
00:14:29.533 --> 00:14:31.742
That's the way we do it, right?
Me and you, we're a team.

103
00:14:32.158 --> 00:14:33.617
But why?

104
00:14:33.658 --> 00:14:36.450
Look, you're not
concentrating, are you?

105
00:14:36.492 --> 00:14:38.617
Do you remember what I said
about aiming the gun?

106
00:14:38.658 --> 00:14:41.075
Use these gun sights to aim.
All right?

107
00:14:41.117 --> 00:14:43.908
You don't look at the target,
target's in the background, blurry.

108
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.825
You're still aiming
at it, but it's these.

109
00:14:45.867 --> 00:14:47.533
That's what you use
to focus. Yeah?

110
00:14:47.575 --> 00:14:49.575
Come on, you know what to do.
Have another go.

111
00:14:50.992 --> 00:14:52.783
I want to start school
this fall.

112
00:14:55.075 --> 00:14:56.075
What?

113
00:14:57.742 --> 00:15:01.617
Lees, you're not
concentrating, are you? Focus.

114
00:15:01.658 --> 00:15:04.617
Dad, I have to think about my future.
I have to have a profession.

115
00:15:04.658 --> 00:15:06.992
What, you want an office job?
Come on.

116
00:15:07.033 --> 00:15:08.533
I'm not saying that.

117
00:15:08.534 --> 00:15:11.743
I could be, like,
a writer or an artist.

118
00:15:11.783 --> 00:15:14.533
Oh, yeah. That's just what the world
needs, is another artist.

119
00:15:14.534 --> 00:15:15.743
Begging on the street for money.

120
00:15:15.783 --> 00:15:17.533
"Please, please pay me,

121
00:15:17.534 --> 00:15:19.909
pay me to express
my innermost thoughts."

122
00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.075
What have I always told you,
Lees? It's to be independent.

123
00:15:23.117 --> 00:15:25.033
Don't have to rely
on anyone else.

124
00:15:25.034 --> 00:15:27.699
But to be independent,
I have to have skills.

125
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.700
You got plenty of skills.

126
00:15:29.742 --> 00:15:32.033
I taught you everything
you need to know.

127
00:15:32.075 --> 00:15:35.658
After this summer,
I'm starting school. That's it.

128
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.825
<i>Police are
investigating the sudden illness</i>

129
00:15:43.867 --> 00:15:47.783
<i>of a Russian opposition
activist named Sergei Skuratov.</i>

130
00:15:47.825 --> 00:15:52.617
<i>Skuratov and his wife were found unconscious
Sunday in New York's Central Park,</i>

131
00:15:52.658 --> 00:15:55.533
<i>after attending
the international summit...</i>

132
00:15:55.534 --> 00:15:57.909
<i>on regime evolution in Russia.</i>

133
00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.700
<i>This is a major incident.</i>

134
00:15:59.742 --> 00:16:03.033
<i>We have determined
that it was attempted murder</i>

135
00:16:03.075 --> 00:16:05.992
<i>by administration
of a nerve agent.</i>

136
00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:07.700
<i>I will not...</i>

137
00:16:07.742 --> 00:16:09.867
Lees, I'm off to work.

138
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.658
Lees, off to work.

139
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.742
Be back late, okay?
I've put you a pizza in the oven.

140
00:16:16.783 --> 00:16:18.575
Frozen pizza again?

141
00:16:18.617 --> 00:16:20.617
Do you ever listen
to anything I say?

142
00:16:20.658 --> 00:16:22.742
I'm detoxing.

143
00:16:41.742 --> 00:16:45.700
All right, break it up, lads!
Right! I said break it up!

144
00:16:49.492 --> 00:16:52.033
Enough! Okay? Break it up!

145
00:16:52.033 --> 00:16:53.533
Get the fuck out of here!

146
00:16:54.742 --> 00:16:57.075
Mate, what the fuck
was that all about?

147
00:16:57.117 --> 00:16:59.617
You want the police
to turn up here again?

148
00:17:03.033 --> 00:17:04.033
Sorry, I'm all right.

149
00:17:05.033 --> 00:17:06.533
Listen to me.

150
00:17:06.534 --> 00:17:09.618
Get your shit together.
You hear me?

151
00:17:11.867 --> 00:17:13.367
Sorry, mate.

152
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.908
Okay. Next.

153
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.450
That was quite an impressive
display of anger management, Martin.

154
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.700
Purse on the tray.

155
00:17:39.533 --> 00:17:43.075
Did you know that anger is always
preceded by feelings of pain?

156
00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:47.600
You should probably mind your own
business, don't you, love?

157
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.450
Next.

158
00:17:49.492 --> 00:17:51.700
We are in the same business.
We need to talk.

159
00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:30.867
You forgot this.

160
00:18:34.033 --> 00:18:38.533
I'd be a bit more careful with my
belongings if I was you, Ms. Stepanenko.

161
00:18:41.992 --> 00:18:43.783
Interesting name, huh?
What is it?

162
00:18:43.825 --> 00:18:45.033
Russian?

163
00:18:46.158 --> 00:18:47.450
Ukrainian.

164
00:18:49.742 --> 00:18:52.742
You do remember my father,
Egor, don't you?

165
00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:56.992
You worked with him.
The Gazette?

166
00:18:57.033 --> 00:18:59.575
Kiev, 12 years ago?
He told me you were

167
00:18:59.617 --> 00:19:01.533
the best investigative reporter
he'd ever met.

168
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.825
I think you might have me
confused with somebody else.

169
00:19:09.992 --> 00:19:11.908
This was taken
on my father's cell phone.

170
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.367
It was taken just a few days
before he died.

171
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.100
My father,

172
00:19:19.101 --> 00:19:21.268
his colleague Olga...

173
00:19:22.158 --> 00:19:24.033
and this is you, right?

174
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.825
How did you find me?

175
00:19:39.492 --> 00:19:42.783
I'm a journalist,
just like my dad.

176
00:19:44.867 --> 00:19:46.700
What do you want?

177
00:19:46.742 --> 00:19:49.492
My father's mission is mine now.

178
00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:51.867
Nothing has changed
since he died.

179
00:19:51.868 --> 00:19:53.701
Have you seen the latest news?

180
00:19:53.702 --> 00:19:55.910
Look, what happened to your
father, that was a tragedy, but...

181
00:19:55.911 --> 00:19:58.036
I need your help
to get the files.

182
00:20:05.258 --> 00:20:06.967
Down!

183
00:20:48.592 --> 00:20:50.658
Sasha!

184
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.533
Martin! You old fox.

185
00:22:03.534 --> 00:22:07.368
Home at last.
Been a long time, huh?

186
00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:17.742
What's going on, Trevor?

187
00:22:17.783 --> 00:22:23.158
Old lady throw you out again?
Or CIA starting another war?

188
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.033
Just craving a little
chitchat with an old buddy.

189
00:22:27.075 --> 00:22:28.617
Why don't you sit down?

190
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.575
See you found the beer.

191
00:22:39.617 --> 00:22:42.825
Pleased to meet you.
John Edwards, MI6.

192
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.783
Heard a lot about you.

193
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.367
- You're bleeding.
- Oh, don't worry.

194
00:22:51.408 --> 00:22:56.367
Nothing serious, just a little
intranasal tumor. Comes and goes.

195
00:22:56.408 --> 00:22:59.867
Just can't seem to find the time
to schedule the surgery, though.

196
00:22:59.868 --> 00:23:03.118
I'd get on to that if I was you.
Can't be too careful.

197
00:23:07.742 --> 00:23:10.450
Wanna tell me what you're doing
here in the middle of the night?

198
00:23:10.492 --> 00:23:12.433
Alrighty.
Let's get down to it.

199
00:23:14.533 --> 00:23:19.158
We're here because of your little
tête-à-tête with that cute reporter.

200
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.033
What exactly
did you two discuss?

201
00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:25.868
I don't know what to tell you, Trevor.
I mean, I'm a bouncer.

202
00:23:25.908 --> 00:23:28.700
You know, part of the job description
is you gotta talk to people.

203
00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:33.825
When you quit MI6,
we had an agreement.

204
00:23:35.783 --> 00:23:38.950
You don't mess with our business,
we don't mess with yours.

205
00:23:38.992 --> 00:23:41.367
I told you then.

206
00:23:41.408 --> 00:23:44.575
If you tried to get back
in the game,

207
00:23:44.617 --> 00:23:45.783
I'd take you out.

208
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.742
Now, did she mention the files?

209
00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:58.617
It's 12 years ago, Trevor.

210
00:23:58.658 --> 00:24:00.992
Why the fuck are you
bringing it up now?

211
00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:03.158
You know what happened.
The Russians got the files.

212
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.033
Mission not accomplished.

213
00:24:06.034 --> 00:24:09.034
Well, the reality turns out to be

214
00:24:09.035 --> 00:24:11.077
a bit more complicated than that.

215
00:24:13.533 --> 00:24:14.700
Please, enlighten me.

216
00:24:19.908 --> 00:24:22.033
We're all worried
about your health, Martin.

217
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.700
What's that supposed to mean?

218
00:24:27.408 --> 00:24:28.825
They will find you.

219
00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:30.908
The Hilton,
yesterday morning.

220
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:33.867
He was less fortunate than you.

221
00:24:36.868 --> 00:24:39.368
- Who is he?
- One of our chaps.

222
00:24:39.408 --> 00:24:41.533
Got too close to her.

223
00:24:41.575 --> 00:24:42.992
They nabbed him by surprise.

224
00:24:44.033 --> 00:24:45.700
The stakes have gone up, Martin.

225
00:24:45.742 --> 00:24:47.492
The Russians
have repeatedly used

226
00:24:47.533 --> 00:24:48.825
nerve agent in the UK.

227
00:24:48.867 --> 00:24:50.950
Now they've done it
on our turf as well.

228
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.575
We consider this an act of war.

229
00:24:59.033 --> 00:25:01.783
Work with us Martin,
we'll protect you.

230
00:25:01.825 --> 00:25:03.700
Otherwise, well...

231
00:25:05.033 --> 00:25:07.033
you could end up
with a new smile too.

232
00:25:08.658 --> 00:25:10.533
Dad?

233
00:25:10.534 --> 00:25:12.076
Lees, back to bed, please.

234
00:25:12.117 --> 00:25:14.867
- Back to bed.
- Lisa!

235
00:25:17.783 --> 00:25:22.033
Last time I saw you,
you were wearing a poopy diaper.

236
00:25:22.034 --> 00:25:26.368
- Can't sleep.
- You need to go back to bed, sweetheart, okay?

237
00:25:26.408 --> 00:25:29.033
Some daughter you got there.

238
00:25:29.034 --> 00:25:33.151
She's growing up fast.
Looks just like her mother.

239
00:25:33.174 --> 00:25:35.299
I look like myself.

240
00:25:37.658 --> 00:25:39.033
Listen, Martin,

241
00:25:39.034 --> 00:25:42.034
I get you don't give
a rat's ass about the Russians.

242
00:25:42.075 --> 00:25:44.575
Fine. But you realize
those files

243
00:25:44.617 --> 00:25:48.033
would probably expose the
scumbag who betrayed us in Kiev.

244
00:25:50.617 --> 00:25:52.783
If we find the rat
in our network,

245
00:25:52.825 --> 00:25:56.533
I promise you,
he will face a firing squad.

246
00:25:58.867 --> 00:26:01.742
Don't you want to know who's
responsible for her mother's death?

247
00:26:03.533 --> 00:26:06.575
- My mother was in an accident.
- An accident?

248
00:26:06.617 --> 00:26:09.700
- Trevor...
- A car accident.

249
00:26:09.742 --> 00:26:12.408
- You didn't tell her?
- Tell me...

250
00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.408
Right, that's enough.
Get out. Lees! Lees!

251
00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:18.492
Think about the traitor, Martin.

252
00:26:20.158 --> 00:26:23.867
Wouldn't you just love to
encourage his disappearance?

253
00:26:23.908 --> 00:26:28.367
Trevor, I told you before,
I'm out. Now, fuck off!

254
00:26:28.408 --> 00:26:32.533
Very well. If there's ever anything
you'd like to share with me,

255
00:26:32.575 --> 00:26:34.408
you know where to find me.

256
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.033
Good seeing you again, Martin.

257
00:26:49.992 --> 00:26:53.617
I'm sorry, Lees.
I was gonna tell you.

258
00:26:53.658 --> 00:26:55.992
- Go away.
- Lees, honey, just...

259
00:26:56.033 --> 00:27:00.075
- Will listen to me, please?
- You lied to me.

260
00:27:00.117 --> 00:27:03.700
I was gonna tell you
when you were older.

261
00:27:03.701 --> 00:27:05.701
Go away. Leave me alone.

262
00:27:05.742 --> 00:27:07.867
Please, honey, just...

263
00:27:11.742 --> 00:27:13.783
You lied to me.

264
00:27:42.175 --> 00:27:44.808
Promise me it will
always be like this.

265
00:27:46.033 --> 00:27:48.492
<i>- Promise!
- All right, I promise.</i>

266
00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:51.533
- I promise.
- I don't believe you.

267
00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:25.575
<i>Today, American
counterterrorism forces</i>

268
00:28:25.617 --> 00:28:27.700
<i>took over the investigation.</i>

269
00:28:27.742 --> 00:28:29.783
<i>There is widespread speculation</i>

270
00:28:29.825 --> 00:28:32.492
<i>that the Skuratovs
were poisoned.</i>

271
00:28:32.533 --> 00:28:35.117
<i>Military toxicologists have concluded</i>

272
00:28:35.158 --> 00:28:38.450
<i>that the Kremlin was most
likely responsible</i>

273
00:28:38.492 --> 00:28:43.533
<i>for this heinous act of
terrorism on American soil.</i>

274
00:28:43.534 --> 00:28:45.034
Lees, pack your stuff, please.

275
00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.700
What?

276
00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.065
We're leaving.

277
00:28:50.783 --> 00:28:52.408
Why do we have to leave?

278
00:28:53.092 --> 00:28:55.533
- Dad?
- Just do as I say, okay?

279
00:28:56.908 --> 00:28:59.783
I don't want to leave.
I want to stay here.

280
00:28:59.825 --> 00:29:02.450
- Why is it always about...
- I haven't got time to argue with you!

281
00:29:02.492 --> 00:29:04.367
Just pack your stuff!

282
00:29:56.526 --> 00:29:58.390
Bring him here.

283
00:30:28.825 --> 00:30:30.033
Wonderful.

284
00:30:30.075 --> 00:30:32.950
Perfect profile for a secret agent.

285
00:31:45.617 --> 00:31:48.533
All right, slow down.
Just slow down, okay? You...

286
00:31:49.617 --> 00:31:50.658
Whatever you wanna know...

287
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.575
I want the files.

288
00:31:58.033 --> 00:31:59.950
What files?
What are you talking about?

289
00:32:01.158 --> 00:32:02.742
I don't know what files!

290
00:32:09.658 --> 00:32:11.450
Fuck!

291
00:32:14.825 --> 00:32:16.867
Where does she hide them?

292
00:32:18.492 --> 00:32:20.033
You've got the fucking files!

293
00:32:20.075 --> 00:32:21.867
I saw the guy
take the shoulder bag

294
00:32:21.868 --> 00:32:24.118
with my own fucking eyes!
You've got the files!

295
00:32:24.158 --> 00:32:26.450
No! No! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! No!

296
00:32:28.533 --> 00:32:30.783
Fuck!

297
00:32:30.825 --> 00:32:35.033
Maybe this refreshes your memory.

298
00:32:48.992 --> 00:32:51.867
Okay, okay.

299
00:32:53.867 --> 00:32:57.367
Sasha knows where the files are.
I can get them for you.

300
00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.433
She thinks I'm a journalist.

301
00:33:00.575 --> 00:33:03.408
I used to work with her father.
You know that, right?

302
00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.575
I can get you files.

303
00:33:07.825 --> 00:33:09.700
- You will get them.
- Yes.

304
00:33:19.056 --> 00:33:21.056
The files and the reporter.

305
00:33:21.095 --> 00:33:23.095
24 hours.

306
00:33:27.033 --> 00:33:30.033
I want the files
and the reporter.

307
00:33:32.617 --> 00:33:35.700
Dead or alive, I don't care.

308
00:33:35.701 --> 00:33:38.951
You've got 24 hours.

309
00:34:10.408 --> 00:34:12.533
<i>You will get her out.</i>

310
00:34:12.575 --> 00:34:15.867
<i>Promise me. Promise me. Promise me.</i>

311
00:34:59.783 --> 00:35:00.908
Lisa.

312
00:35:02.658 --> 00:35:05.450
Your father is collecting
a present for me.

313
00:35:07.075 --> 00:35:10.075
If you are nice,
we will be nice.

314
00:35:11.867 --> 00:35:15.867
You can order all candy,
chips, soda you want, okay?

315
00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:21.033
I want a berry smoothie.

316
00:35:22.867 --> 00:35:26.700
Strawberries, blueberries,
raspberries and two cups of spinach.

317
00:35:29.094 --> 00:35:31.359
Bring her a strawberry milkshake.

318
00:35:34.783 --> 00:35:36.950
Do you like cartoons?

319
00:35:56.867 --> 00:36:00.117
<i>He's just parked at
Shaftesbury Avenue, Soho.</i>

320
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:01.658
<i>Maxi Million Club.</i>

321
00:36:10.867 --> 00:36:11.950
He's in.

322
00:36:11.992 --> 00:36:13.700
Go check it out.

323
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.992
When I tell you I'm out,
that means I'm out.

324
00:36:31.492 --> 00:36:34.033
- Hey, mate.
- Hey.

325
00:36:34.034 --> 00:36:37.118
- Maxim around?
- Who's asking?

326
00:36:37.158 --> 00:36:39.575
Tell him Bully Boy's here to see him.

327
00:36:44.033 --> 00:36:46.367
Wow. Bully Boy.

328
00:36:48.742 --> 00:36:49.825
Have a seat.

329
00:36:52.075 --> 00:36:54.992
- Cognac?
- I'm good.

330
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.617
So, what brings you down here
in the middle of the night?

331
00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.033
Are we okay to talk business?

332
00:37:07.033 --> 00:37:08.867
Yeah, sure.

333
00:37:10.033 --> 00:37:11.825
Go ahead.

334
00:37:11.867 --> 00:37:15.700
I got a fight coming up
with this Armenian guy.

335
00:37:15.742 --> 00:37:19.192
And the funny thing is that the Russians
are talking about the Armenian guy

336
00:37:19.195 --> 00:37:21.029
kicking the bucket
during the bout.

337
00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:26.533
Bucket kicking?
Like, you mean... die?

338
00:37:29.533 --> 00:37:31.617
Apparently, there's a girl
mixed up in this as well.

339
00:37:31.658 --> 00:37:35.783
Ukrainian girl, blonde hair,
phoenix tattoo on her neck.

340
00:37:35.825 --> 00:37:37.533
Says she's a journalist.

341
00:37:37.534 --> 00:37:39.118
Know anything about that?

342
00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.367
Why should I know about her?

343
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.825
Well, because I found this.

344
00:37:47.867 --> 00:37:49.832
In her wallet.

345
00:37:56.817 --> 00:37:58.383
So?

346
00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.208
So I think it's about time
you quit the bullshit, Maxim.

347
00:38:01.211 --> 00:38:02.619
Don't you? Where is she?

348
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.117
I don't like your tone, Bully Boy.

349
00:38:07.533 --> 00:38:09.950
Sit down. Calm down.

350
00:38:09.992 --> 00:38:12.450
How the fuck did you
get that in here?

351
00:38:14.825 --> 00:38:16.950
Came to see you, didn't she?

352
00:38:16.992 --> 00:38:18.658
That's how she found me.

353
00:38:20.117 --> 00:38:21.950
You are a dead man walking.

354
00:38:23.908 --> 00:38:25.492
Get your phone out.

355
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:30.075
Get your fucking phone out.
I'm not gonna ask you again. Do it.

356
00:39:42.575 --> 00:39:46.075
Look at that. He's in close,
but he can't get a punch in,

357
00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:49.742
so he ties his opponent's arms and
pushes him back at the same time.

358
00:39:49.783 --> 00:39:51.992
See how he pushes Spence
back on the ropes?

359
00:39:52.033 --> 00:39:54.450
A lot of fighters get
uncomfortable in that situation.

360
00:39:54.492 --> 00:39:56.075
Especially Shawn Spence.

361
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.867
So you think this
Smokin' Joe will win?

362
00:40:08.908 --> 00:40:10.950
Oh, yeah.
I'd put cash on him,

363
00:40:10.992 --> 00:40:13.658
70/30 odds, at least.

364
00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.367
There he goes. Oh!

365
00:40:16.408 --> 00:40:18.033
That hurt!

366
00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:23.367
What did I tell you?
Wish I'd put money on that.

367
00:40:25.867 --> 00:40:27.617
You put money?

368
00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:11.033
I'm here to help you.

369
00:41:14.617 --> 00:41:17.950
Your father was my friend. I'm not
gonna let the same thing happen to you.

370
00:41:17.992 --> 00:41:20.408
- Give me your phone.
- Why?

371
00:41:22.033 --> 00:41:23.575
How do you think I found you?

372
00:41:25.533 --> 00:41:28.314
Take this. It's safe.

373
00:41:32.075 --> 00:41:33.867
You do know what we're
up against, right?

374
00:41:35.567 --> 00:41:37.150
They don't scare me.

375
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:39.700
I want those files published.

376
00:41:41.158 --> 00:41:42.950
To avenge your father's death?

377
00:41:44.492 --> 00:41:46.867
Yes. And all the others.

378
00:41:53.908 --> 00:41:55.867
I found his log book.

379
00:41:55.908 --> 00:41:58.742
The last entry was about a meeting
with a woman he called Red Star.

380
00:42:01.492 --> 00:42:05.033
Red Star had collected evidence
of a chemical weapons program.

381
00:42:05.034 --> 00:42:07.909
She had gotten hold
of the formula for Novichok.

382
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:10.742
She even had samples of it.

383
00:42:10.783 --> 00:42:12.825
Your father didn't tell me that.

384
00:42:14.767 --> 00:42:16.892
Red Star thought it was too risky
to bring the files to the meeting,

385
00:42:16.933 --> 00:42:19.433
so she put them in a bank.

386
00:42:19.575 --> 00:42:22.533
- She put them in a bank?
- Yes.

387
00:42:22.534 --> 00:42:26.451
- Where is this bank, Sasha?
- I'm the only one who knows.

388
00:42:28.658 --> 00:42:30.783
The address of the bank
was in his log book.

389
00:42:32.533 --> 00:42:33.825
I burned it.

390
00:42:36.875 --> 00:42:38.875
You have the address of the bank, right?

391
00:42:39.617 --> 00:42:43.617
Red Star wanted to give my father
the code to the safe deposit box.

392
00:42:45.533 --> 00:42:46.825
Shit.

393
00:42:47.067 --> 00:42:49.108
Very smart.

394
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.533
I need your help to get the code.

395
00:43:02.033 --> 00:43:05.408
For fuck's sake,
taking a nap while on duty?

396
00:43:12.742 --> 00:43:14.783
Let it ring.

397
00:43:14.825 --> 00:43:17.158
Turn around,
don't you look at me.

398
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.617
Let me see your hands.

399
00:43:20.075 --> 00:43:23.033
- Who are you?
- Don't you worry about that.

400
00:43:23.034 --> 00:43:25.368
Log into the CIA system.

401
00:43:25.408 --> 00:43:27.867
We're just a trading company.

402
00:43:27.868 --> 00:43:30.076
- Don't know what you think...
- If you don't want me to blow your brains out

403
00:43:30.077 --> 00:43:32.119
all over this nice monitor,
I'd do as you're told.

404
00:43:40.617 --> 00:43:42.075
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What you doing?

405
00:43:42.117 --> 00:43:44.575
What you doing?
I know your game.

406
00:43:45.867 --> 00:43:48.117
You got a real password
and a fake one, yeah?

407
00:43:48.158 --> 00:43:51.950
Let me suggest something.
Put the real one in.

408
00:43:56.825 --> 00:43:58.742
Okay. Operation Red Star.

409
00:43:58.783 --> 00:44:00.117
I wanna see everything you've got.

410
00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:06.867
Keep going. 12 years ago, Kiev.

411
00:44:17.992 --> 00:44:19.492
Okay.

412
00:44:24.158 --> 00:44:25.700
All right, stop.

413
00:44:25.742 --> 00:44:29.367
There's a handwritten note.
Yellow handwritten note.

414
00:44:34.468 --> 00:44:35.509
Yeah?

415
00:44:35.533 --> 00:44:37.658
A van just pulled up outside.

416
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:38.908
Men with guns.

417
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:40.533
<i>Get out of there.</i>

418
00:44:43.533 --> 00:44:45.658
It's encrypted.
I don't have access.

419
00:44:48.742 --> 00:44:50.033
Print it. Everything.

420
00:44:56.408 --> 00:44:57.575
Is it printing or not?

421
00:44:57.617 --> 00:44:59.867
- Yeah, it's coming.
- Come on.

422
00:45:09.492 --> 00:45:11.033
Get up! Move!

423
00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:13.408
- Where's the escape route?
- The what?

424
00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.617
- The fucking escape route!
- On the back wall!

425
00:45:18.867 --> 00:45:20.950
Where is it?

426
00:45:35.617 --> 00:45:37.408
Martin!

427
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:43.867
What's going on?

428
00:45:43.908 --> 00:45:45.617
I've got a hostage here.

429
00:45:47.617 --> 00:45:49.867
Martin, let's talk
about this, shall we?

430
00:45:51.492 --> 00:45:53.492
Come on. If you have a gun,
just put it down.

431
00:45:53.533 --> 00:45:55.492
We don't want anyone
getting hurt.

432
00:45:55.533 --> 00:45:59.033
You hear me? Martin?

433
00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:03.950
Martin, I'm coming in.

434
00:46:12.158 --> 00:46:13.950
Two! Down! Let's go.

435
00:46:44.825 --> 00:46:47.617
Game over, mate. Slowly up.

436
00:48:44.533 --> 00:48:46.367
Jig's up, Martin.

437
00:49:01.575 --> 00:49:02.867
One on him.

438
00:49:07.408 --> 00:49:09.142
- What took you so long?
- Drive.

439
00:49:38.946 --> 00:49:40.822
Ten hours have passed.

440
00:49:43.908 --> 00:49:45.751
Increases the pressure.

441
00:49:47.862 --> 00:49:49.660
Yes, I will do it.

442
00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.492
You're telling me MI6, CIA,
they're all after us?

443
00:50:00.033 --> 00:50:02.117
It's not even our main concern.

444
00:50:14.575 --> 00:50:16.533
You're not like any
reporter I've ever met.

445
00:50:18.867 --> 00:50:21.533
That's 'cause
I'm the best, right?

446
00:50:21.575 --> 00:50:23.575
Isn't that
what your father said?

447
00:50:46.533 --> 00:50:48.950
- Fuck!
- What's wrong?

448
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.150
They've changed the encryption.

449
00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:02.450
Martin!

450
00:51:03.783 --> 00:51:05.350
You're surrounded!

451
00:51:06.158 --> 00:51:07.867
Come out with your hands
above your head.

452
00:51:07.908 --> 00:51:09.867
We will use force.

453
00:51:13.492 --> 00:51:15.367
Final warning, Martin.

454
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:24.950
Good. Very good.

455
00:51:24.992 --> 00:51:26.575
Now move forward.

456
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:31.033
Slowly.

457
00:51:34.533 --> 00:51:36.867
Tell your men
to put their guns down.

458
00:51:36.868 --> 00:51:38.784
Do as I say or I'll kill him.

459
00:51:38.825 --> 00:51:41.825
The files you're looking
for are in a bank.

460
00:51:41.867 --> 00:51:44.075
Martin has the code
to the vault in his head.

461
00:51:44.117 --> 00:51:46.075
He's the only one who knows it.

462
00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.742
Now you tell me,
shall I blow his brains out?

463
00:51:50.783 --> 00:51:53.367
That would just
break my heart there, Sasha.

464
00:51:53.408 --> 00:51:56.367
- Am I?
- For christ sake, Trevor!

465
00:51:59.725 --> 00:52:02.642
Tell them to put
their guns down, now!

466
00:52:02.783 --> 00:52:04.783
Come on, please.

467
00:52:13.658 --> 00:52:15.955
I'm the only one who knows
the location of the bank.

468
00:52:16.075 --> 00:52:17.117
Calm down.

469
00:52:18.575 --> 00:52:19.825
Three...

470
00:52:22.958 --> 00:52:24.750
You're bluffing.

471
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:26.593
Two...

472
00:52:26.617 --> 00:52:29.033
Sasha. Sasha.
What are you doing?

473
00:52:38.408 --> 00:52:40.017
- One!
- Okay, okay.

474
00:52:57.833 --> 00:53:00.925
I told you, he wants those
files more than anything.

475
00:53:07.375 --> 00:53:08.500
Wake up!

476
00:53:13.783 --> 00:53:15.033
What did he want?

477
00:53:16.042 --> 00:53:18.250
You guys seem to know
each other pretty well.

478
00:53:18.992 --> 00:53:20.417
Who?

479
00:53:20.858 --> 00:53:22.683
Don't play games
with me, Martin.

480
00:53:22.825 --> 00:53:25.492
You know who I'm talking about.

481
00:53:29.825 --> 00:53:34.700
He said it was a handwritten note.
Yellow paper.

482
00:53:34.742 --> 00:53:36.450
I could only print
the encrypted version.

483
00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.492
I'm sure you got a lot
of questions, Sasha,

484
00:53:39.533 --> 00:53:41.283
but you're just gonna
have to trust me, okay?

485
00:53:42.158 --> 00:53:43.908
When was the encryption
last updated?

486
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:47.367
- Uh, six months ago.
- Good.

487
00:53:47.408 --> 00:53:49.358
Then he doesn't have
what he was looking for.

488
00:53:51.533 --> 00:53:53.533
Look, believe me,
I'm as scared as you are.

489
00:53:53.575 --> 00:53:54.783
I'm not scared.

490
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:57.742
Did anyone ever
follow up on this?

491
00:53:57.783 --> 00:54:00.617
Yeah, but the number is not
registered to any network.

492
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.033
Hey, mate. Fancy a joyride?

493
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.700
Not a phone number.
The fucking code to the vault.

494
00:54:15.701 --> 00:54:17.576
Print it out.

495
00:54:19.033 --> 00:54:20.533
What do we do now?

496
00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.908
- Got a credit card?
- Yes.

497
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:28.417
Get it out.

498
00:54:29.117 --> 00:54:30.867
Time to set a trap.

499
00:54:30.908 --> 00:54:32.533
<i>- A trap?
- Yes.</i>

500
00:54:32.575 --> 00:54:33.992
<i>Trevor's got
the code to the vault.</i>

501
00:54:34.033 --> 00:54:36.700
<i>So let's lead him
to the honeypot.</i>

502
00:54:36.702 --> 00:54:39.660
- Give me status.
- He's close.

503
00:54:50.658 --> 00:54:52.033
We've lost him.

504
00:55:04.658 --> 00:55:07.367
Oh, sorry! Excuse me.

505
00:55:07.408 --> 00:55:09.867
Sorry, I really wasn't looking
where I was going, was I?

506
00:55:09.908 --> 00:55:11.117
Sorry.

507
00:55:20.492 --> 00:55:23.408
It's British.
Gonna be all right with that?

508
00:55:28.117 --> 00:55:29.950
We got a hit.

509
00:55:29.992 --> 00:55:31.825
Sasha just booked
two tickets to Moscow.

510
00:55:33.533 --> 00:55:36.033
A hotel in the city center.
I'll make some calls.

511
00:55:36.034 --> 00:55:38.743
Don't bother.
They're not going to Moscow.

512
00:55:38.783 --> 00:55:40.033
He's not that stupid.

513
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:44.408
Check all outbound flights
from every airport

514
00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:47.867
within a hundred mile radius for a
passenger named Sasha Stepanenko.

515
00:55:47.868 --> 00:55:50.451
- Check the trains too.
- What about Martin?

516
00:55:52.158 --> 00:55:55.034
You seriously think he'd
travel under his own name?

517
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:01.783
Give me all the security
camera footage

518
00:56:01.825 --> 00:56:04.117
from every airport in London.

519
00:56:16.658 --> 00:56:19.033
That's pretty. Is it really yours?

520
00:56:19.034 --> 00:56:20.368
Your bracelet.

521
00:56:34.158 --> 00:56:38.575
<i>It is now clear that
Sergei Skuratov and his wife Yulia</i>

522
00:56:38.617 --> 00:56:41.867
<i>were poisoned by
a military grade nerve agent</i>

523
00:56:41.908 --> 00:56:45.783
<i>of a type Russia has
developed in the past.</i>

524
00:56:45.825 --> 00:56:49.533
<i>It's one of a group of nerve
agents known as Novichok.</i>

525
00:56:49.534 --> 00:56:52.409
<i>I hope you
have good news for me.</i>

526
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:53.700
I know where the files are.

527
00:56:53.742 --> 00:56:55.117
<i>I'm gonna need more time.</i>

528
00:56:55.158 --> 00:56:57.533
Listen, if you're trying
to trick me,

529
00:56:57.575 --> 00:56:59.783
you will not win.
You understand me?

530
00:56:59.825 --> 00:57:02.033
Nobody's trying
to trick anyone here, okay?

531
00:57:02.075 --> 00:57:05.408
<i>The files are in Kiev.
Sasha is taking me there now.</i>

532
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:07.075
<i>We're close.
I just need a little more time.</i>

533
00:57:07.117 --> 00:57:10.533
<i>How do I know this is true?</i>

534
00:57:10.575 --> 00:57:11.950
Well, do you want
the files or not?

535
00:57:14.075 --> 00:57:15.950
Say hello to your father.

536
00:57:17.492 --> 00:57:19.992
- Dad?
- <i>Sweetheart, you all right?</i>

537
00:57:20.033 --> 00:57:21.950
How are you doing?

538
00:57:21.992 --> 00:57:24.992
Okay, I guess.
I'm having a pedicure.

539
00:57:25.033 --> 00:57:27.075
- When will you come?
- That's enough.

540
00:57:28.575 --> 00:57:31.450
I want to speak
to him more. He misses me.

541
00:57:35.158 --> 00:57:37.658
I'm sure he does.

542
00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:39.908
You have no children, do you?

543
00:57:42.617 --> 00:57:44.700
If you were a mother,
you wouldn't do this.

544
00:57:46.033 --> 00:57:47.908
You think you know me?

545
00:57:51.408 --> 00:57:53.450
If you had kids,
I bet they'd hate you.

546
00:57:58.533 --> 00:58:01.533
You think you are
an intelligent girl, right?

547
00:58:04.158 --> 00:58:07.908
Good. Let me tell you a story
about your father and your mother.

548
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.408
You know what he did?

549
00:58:13.867 --> 00:58:16.867
Your father told her
he was a journalist.

550
00:58:18.533 --> 00:58:22.367
He pretended to love her,
but he was really a spy.

551
00:58:24.783 --> 00:58:28.367
So my question is,
intelligent girl,

552
00:58:28.408 --> 00:58:29.533
what are you for him?

553
00:58:30.908 --> 00:58:32.658
Accident, maybe?

554
00:58:33.867 --> 00:58:35.533
Or maybe you good for cover.

555
00:58:35.533 --> 00:58:38.367
You don't know shit.
I was born out of love.

556
00:58:38.408 --> 00:58:41.825
- He told me.
- Okay, we are finished.

557
00:58:41.867 --> 00:58:43.867
We can't be late for the fight.

558
00:58:47.408 --> 00:58:49.575
Bingo! They're on a flight to Kiev.

559
00:58:52.408 --> 00:58:53.908
All right.

560
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:55.992
Get in touch
with our Ukrainian friends.

561
00:58:59.117 --> 00:59:02.075
Ask for Colonel Zelenko,
send him that picture.

562
00:59:02.117 --> 00:59:05.158
Tell him I want him
to keep a close eye on them.

563
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.950
Come on.
Get your ass in gear. Let's go.

564
00:59:20.749 --> 00:59:22.749
Hi! How can I help you?

565
00:59:23.133 --> 00:59:24.700
We'd like to rent a car.

566
00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:36.681
It's them.

567
01:00:14.867 --> 01:00:16.617
Is something wrong?

568
01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:21.783
I haven't been here since he died.

569
01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:40.825
<i>We ended our
chemical weapons program in 1992.</i>

570
01:00:40.867 --> 01:00:44.177
<i>We eliminated all the chemical
weapons that existed in Russia.</i>

571
01:00:44.201 --> 01:00:45.618
Martin, look.

572
01:00:45.867 --> 01:00:48.533
<i>But at the same time
we are very suspicious</i>

573
01:00:48.534 --> 01:00:52.826
<i>of everything that's happened around
this provocation against Russia.</i>

574
01:00:52.867 --> 01:00:56.142
<i>And naturally,
we want to know the truth.</i>

575
01:00:56.283 --> 01:00:59.617
The Russians' position in this case
is becoming increasingly bizarre.

576
01:00:59.658 --> 01:01:01.825
You know what the next step is?

577
01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:03.950
They're gonna start
blaming the Americans.

578
01:01:07.825 --> 01:01:09.908
You remind me of my father.

579
01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:20.658
Your father was a very brave man.

580
01:01:21.733 --> 01:01:23.250
And very stubborn.

581
01:01:26.533 --> 01:01:28.450
Little bit like you.

582
01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.700
Why did you leave Kiev?

583
01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:45.658
I lost someone too.

584
01:01:48.033 --> 01:01:49.408
A woman?

585
01:01:57.117 --> 01:01:58.700
She died?

586
01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:14.617
<i>Never get personally
involved during a mission, Martin.</i>

587
01:02:14.658 --> 01:02:17.492
<i>That leads to failure, remember?</i>

588
01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:19.700
<i>We don't want that.</i>

589
01:02:26.867 --> 01:02:28.700
You were right.

590
01:02:30.092 --> 01:02:33.008
He won with a knockout
in the third round.

591
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:35.742
How do you know that?

592
01:02:37.867 --> 01:02:40.492
What happened to my mother?

593
01:02:40.533 --> 01:02:43.033
Forget about that.

594
01:02:43.033 --> 01:02:46.783
No, tell me. I want to know.

595
01:02:46.825 --> 01:02:50.700
I can't tell you.
You should ask your father.

596
01:02:53.575 --> 01:02:55.033
Tell me.

597
01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:02.825
Your mother was
in a dangerous situation.

598
01:03:02.867 --> 01:03:06.492
Your father tried to save her.

599
01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:09.575
- She got hit.
- Hit?

600
01:03:10.867 --> 01:03:13.700
- By a bullet.
- Who did it?

601
01:03:18.992 --> 01:03:20.408
Did he?

602
01:03:22.908 --> 01:03:25.367
It was an accident, Lisa.

603
01:04:47.533 --> 01:04:49.575
<i>Sorry, I can't get
to the phone right now,</i>

604
01:04:49.617 --> 01:04:51.367
<i>but please leave a message.</i>

605
01:04:51.408 --> 01:04:54.075
I'm in Kiev, waiting for your call.

606
01:05:20.433 --> 01:05:22.017
So far, so good.

607
01:05:26.533 --> 01:05:28.417
You sure you're ready for this?

608
01:06:00.183 --> 01:06:02.004
Hi, how can I help you?

609
01:06:02.008 --> 01:06:04.008
I wish to see my
safe deposit box in the vault.

610
01:06:04.512 --> 01:06:06.358
Your documents, please.

611
01:06:11.214 --> 01:06:12.792
One moment.

612
01:06:18.964 --> 01:06:21.740
Hello, Miss Stepanenko.
Follow me please.

613
01:06:33.125 --> 01:06:34.872
Good morning.

614
01:06:42.473 --> 01:06:44.473
Good day. Open the door, please.

615
01:07:13.236 --> 01:07:16.968
First enter the number
of the box and then your code.

616
01:07:17.523 --> 01:07:19.044
I leave you.

617
01:07:19.063 --> 01:07:21.761
If you need assistance,
please call me.

618
01:07:21.894 --> 01:07:23.894
- Thank you.
- You have 15 minutes.

619
01:07:31.408 --> 01:07:33.867
First corridor on the left
after the security gates,

620
01:07:33.908 --> 01:07:35.408
then down the stairs,

621
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:36.867
<i>second right,
then third right.</i>

622
01:07:36.868 --> 01:07:38.618
- <i>There's a security guard.</i>
- Yeah.

623
01:07:38.658 --> 01:07:40.992
Looks like the bait worked,
stay where you are.

624
01:07:44.372 --> 01:07:46.037
Take me to the safe deposit box.

625
01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.363
What happened?

626
01:07:47.387 --> 01:07:49.863
Take me to the safe deposit box.

627
01:07:50.998 --> 01:07:53.319
Sure. Follow me.

628
01:07:53.738 --> 01:07:55.361
Your pass, please.

629
01:07:55.736 --> 01:07:57.736
You can't enter without a pass.

630
01:08:04.375 --> 01:08:06.009
What's going on?

631
01:08:06.033 --> 01:08:07.625
We'll take care of it, sir.
It won't take long.

632
01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:09.200
Whoa, whoa.
Show me the vault.

633
01:08:09.224 --> 01:08:11.890
- But there's an emergency, sir.
- Take me to the fucking vault.

634
01:08:26.067 --> 01:08:27.942
I'll take it from here.

635
01:08:28.045 --> 01:08:29.610
Stay here.

636
01:08:31.408 --> 01:08:33.867
Nice of you to turn up
to the picnic, Trevor.

637
01:08:36.533 --> 01:08:38.450
Well, well, well.

638
01:08:38.492 --> 01:08:41.367
You're getting
predictable, buddy.

639
01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:43.676
Put the gun on her
and shoot her if you have to.

640
01:08:43.678 --> 01:08:44.861
Get inside.

641
01:08:47.033 --> 01:08:49.450
Nice of you to bring it
in person, Trevor.

642
01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:52.742
Punch in the code.
I know you've got it on you.

643
01:08:52.783 --> 01:08:54.117
You give me too much credit.

644
01:08:54.158 --> 01:08:56.658
You want me to fill you up?

645
01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.783
What is it, Martin?

646
01:08:59.825 --> 01:09:01.700
Quick trade with the Russians?

647
01:09:02.908 --> 01:09:05.533
A little revenge
on your former employer?

648
01:09:05.534 --> 01:09:07.118
- What?
- Just do it.

649
01:09:12.992 --> 01:09:16.033
Your new girlfriend,
she recruited you to the people's cause.

650
01:09:18.492 --> 01:09:20.992
Cozy little bedtime
publishing deal?

651
01:09:21.033 --> 01:09:23.117
Look, enough of your bullshit.
Just open it.

652
01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.492
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

653
01:09:43.533 --> 01:09:46.908
What if it's set as a trap?
Think about it.

654
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:50.492
Red Star was FSB.
What if she wanted to fuck us over?

655
01:09:51.533 --> 01:09:54.783
Stop! There's Novichok inside!

656
01:10:00.825 --> 01:10:01.992
Sasha?

657
01:10:02.033 --> 01:10:03.867
We good?

658
01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.033
Tell them to back up!

659
01:10:11.075 --> 01:10:13.075
All the way down the hallway!

660
01:10:13.117 --> 01:10:14.950
Do it or I'll fucking kill him!

661
01:10:17.575 --> 01:10:20.492
You just signed
your own death warrant, man.

662
01:10:20.533 --> 01:10:22.700
Agency's gonna have
a hard-on for you.

663
01:10:22.701 --> 01:10:23.909
You think so, do you?

664
01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:25.992
I'll take my chances.

665
01:10:26.033 --> 01:10:29.450
Hey, Sasha.
You trust this guy?

666
01:10:29.492 --> 01:10:32.908
Like your father did?
You know, 12 years...

667
01:10:50.292 --> 01:10:51.833
This way.

668
01:12:18.575 --> 01:12:20.950
- This looks bad.
- It's a scratch.

669
01:12:20.992 --> 01:12:23.533
Bullet went straight through.
I was lucky.

670
01:12:23.534 --> 01:12:26.701
Ukrainian medicine,
best there is.

671
01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:28.658
This might sting a bit,
but you're a big boy, right?

672
01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.700
Do it.

673
01:12:33.075 --> 01:12:34.533
Sasha, what are you doing?

674
01:12:34.575 --> 01:12:36.450
You're one of them.

675
01:12:36.492 --> 01:12:38.617
- I can explain.
- Don't move.

676
01:12:38.658 --> 01:12:40.158
I swear I'll shoot you.

677
01:12:40.182 --> 01:12:42.515
If you shoot me,
you're gonna kill my daughter too.

678
01:12:43.908 --> 01:12:46.450
The Russians have got her.

679
01:12:46.492 --> 01:12:48.492
Don't move!

680
01:12:48.533 --> 01:12:50.033
You're full of shit.

681
01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:51.867
It's the truth.

682
01:12:55.658 --> 01:12:57.700
I need those files, okay?

683
01:12:57.742 --> 01:12:59.533
My daughter's life depends on it.

684
01:12:59.534 --> 01:13:01.699
I know you want to expose the
people that killed your father.

685
01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:04.575
And I get that, I really do.

686
01:13:04.617 --> 01:13:06.492
But do the ends
justify the means?

687
01:13:07.575 --> 01:13:09.450
You seriously
think I believe you?

688
01:13:09.492 --> 01:13:12.700
Just ask yourself this, okay?

689
01:13:12.742 --> 01:13:14.825
Would your father sacrifice
the life of a little girl?

690
01:13:14.867 --> 01:13:16.867
You don't know shit
about my father!

691
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:45.867
<i>Never get personally
involved during the mission.</i>

692
01:13:47.992 --> 01:13:51.992
<i>You will get
her out. We don't want that.</i>

693
01:13:52.033 --> 01:13:54.950
<i>Promise me? Promise me?</i>

694
01:14:01.492 --> 01:14:05.950
<i>- That leads to failure.
- Olga?</i>

695
01:14:05.992 --> 01:14:08.992
<i>- We don't want that. Failure.
- Olga.</i>

696
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:15.783
<i>Failure.</i>

697
01:14:34.867 --> 01:14:36.950
Yeah?

698
01:14:36.992 --> 01:14:38.367
<i>Martin.</i>

699
01:14:39.767 --> 01:14:41.933
You have what I want?

700
01:14:45.117 --> 01:14:46.633
Yeah.

701
01:14:47.575 --> 01:14:49.533
Yeah, I've got what you want.

702
01:14:49.534 --> 01:14:52.076
Files and reporter?

703
01:14:52.117 --> 01:14:55.658
Yeah. Yeah,
I wanna talk to Lees.

704
01:14:57.950 --> 01:15:00.533
Here, talk to your father.

705
01:15:00.575 --> 01:15:01.658
Dad.

706
01:15:04.908 --> 01:15:06.408
<i>When are you coming to get me?</i>

707
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:15.033
I love you, sweetheart.

708
01:15:17.617 --> 01:15:19.950
Dad, you sound weird.

709
01:15:29.575 --> 01:15:31.908
Just don't ever forget
that I love you, all right?

710
01:15:34.533 --> 01:15:36.117
Dad?

711
01:15:36.158 --> 01:15:37.700
You're worrying me.

712
01:15:39.033 --> 01:15:42.075
All right, Martin.
We meet at 10 p.m.

713
01:15:42.117 --> 01:15:44.533
<i>No funny games.</i>

714
01:16:26.075 --> 01:16:28.492
Why do you always
have to ruin my day?

715
01:16:31.408 --> 01:16:33.492
Trevor, I need your help.

716
01:16:34.533 --> 01:16:36.533
Martin Baxter, asking for help?

717
01:16:37.908 --> 01:16:40.575
- This is a treat.
- <i>They've got her.</i>

718
01:16:40.617 --> 01:16:41.908
<i>The Russians have got Lisa,</i>

719
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:44.033
<i>and they're gonna kill her.</i>

720
01:16:44.035 --> 01:16:47.660
<i>If I don't get the case to them
by 10 p.m. tonight, she's dead.</i>

721
01:16:49.992 --> 01:16:51.575
Where's the case?

722
01:16:53.867 --> 01:16:55.825
<i>She fucked you over, didn't she?</i>

723
01:16:57.667 --> 01:17:00.917
And now you want me
to help you get it back

724
01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:03.075
and give it to the Russians?

725
01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:20.700
Deal is still on the table.

726
01:17:20.701 --> 01:17:23.409
But you know
how the game is played.

727
01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:26.533
Tell me where you are.

728
01:17:28.992 --> 01:17:30.450
Martin?

729
01:17:48.617 --> 01:17:51.408
Miss. I need to know if you have got a
tracking device installed in your vehicles.

730
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:52.952
- In this case, we should call...
- Please, calm down.

731
01:17:52.992 --> 01:17:55.700
Are there tracking devices
installed in the vehicles?

732
01:17:55.701 --> 01:17:57.743
- Tell me where the fucking thing is now!
- Okay!

733
01:17:57.783 --> 01:18:01.033
In the name of Tyner.
Alison Jane Tyner.

734
01:18:01.034 --> 01:18:03.784
It's parked at Pasazhyrskyi,
the central train station.

735
01:18:30.992 --> 01:18:32.567
Move!

736
01:18:35.158 --> 01:18:36.733
Sasha!

737
01:18:38.492 --> 01:18:40.000
Sorry.

738
01:19:18.825 --> 01:19:20.992
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

739
01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.033
<i>You've done well, Martin.</i>

740
01:19:42.035 --> 01:19:45.619
<i>You've used all your skills
to get what we want.</i>

741
01:19:51.075 --> 01:19:53.867
<i>I know you have feelings
for the reporter.</i>

742
01:19:53.908 --> 01:19:57.075
<i>But she's not important.</i>

743
01:19:57.117 --> 01:19:59.825
<i>Just collateral damage.</i>

744
01:19:59.867 --> 01:20:02.658
Testing, testing. Check, check.
Do you hear that?

745
01:20:04.075 --> 01:20:05.908
Testing.

746
01:20:18.658 --> 01:20:20.992
<i>What is important is you,</i>

747
01:20:21.033 --> 01:20:23.867
<i>our daughter, and our mission.</i>

748
01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.033
I love you so much, Martin.

749
01:21:04.033 --> 01:21:05.867
I'm not armed.

750
01:21:10.533 --> 01:21:13.492
I'm gonna get my phone
out of my pocket, okay?

751
01:21:13.533 --> 01:21:16.492
What did I tell you?
No fucking games.

752
01:21:16.533 --> 01:21:18.533
I'm gonna send you a link.

753
01:21:20.117 --> 01:21:21.742
It's a link to a video stream.

754
01:21:21.783 --> 01:21:23.867
Just open it.

755
01:21:26.867 --> 01:21:29.533
The files are in that case.

756
01:21:29.534 --> 01:21:32.076
Once Lisa is safe,
I'll send you the address.

757
01:21:37.908 --> 01:21:39.700
She can hear you.

758
01:21:42.533 --> 01:21:43.783
Sasha.

759
01:21:44.474 --> 01:21:47.139
I know you have a present for me.

760
01:22:04.533 --> 01:22:06.908
It was the bracelet
of my daughter.

761
01:22:10.450 --> 01:22:11.967
What does it say?

762
01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.992
Masha.

763
01:22:23.908 --> 01:22:25.575
Thank you.

764
01:22:35.533 --> 01:22:37.292
Now go.

765
01:22:37.396 --> 01:22:39.396
Take her to him.

766
01:22:46.575 --> 01:22:49.075
It's all gonna be
over soon, sweetheart.

767
01:22:49.117 --> 01:22:50.783
I promise.

768
01:22:57.794 --> 01:22:59.559
He's unarmed!

769
01:23:13.533 --> 01:23:16.867
Saksahanskoho Street 97, first floor.

770
01:23:21.604 --> 01:23:23.604
Go together.

771
01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:53.742
Now!

772
01:23:55.075 --> 01:23:56.533
Move!

773
01:24:06.033 --> 01:24:07.825
Stay down!

774
01:24:25.873 --> 01:24:27.360
She's out.

775
01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:28.513
What?

776
01:24:28.744 --> 01:24:30.744
She ran out of bullets.

777
01:24:40.908 --> 01:24:42.450
You all right, sweetheart?

778
01:24:53.850 --> 01:24:55.775
Martin, you know what I want.

779
01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.908
- I've got it!
- Don't do it, Martin!

780
01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:15.742
Publish the files!

781
01:25:32.908 --> 01:25:35.033
No matter what happens to me...

782
01:25:36.825 --> 01:25:38.992
you stay here,
all right, sweetheart?

783
01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.575
Dad, no. Don't.

784
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:50.025
You stay here.

785
01:25:57.033 --> 01:25:59.950
Dad! Stop!

786
01:26:02.408 --> 01:26:06.075
Let her go,
and I'll throw you the case!

787
01:26:06.117 --> 01:26:07.450
Throw me the fuckin' files!

788
01:26:07.492 --> 01:26:08.783
Don't do it!

789
01:26:15.392 --> 01:26:16.983
Dad!

790
01:26:20.825 --> 01:26:24.000
Dad, Dad!

791
01:26:24.671 --> 01:26:26.506
On your knees.

792
01:26:26.509 --> 01:26:28.990
I said on your knees.

793
01:26:32.039 --> 01:26:34.615
My regards to your dad.

794
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:03.033
Lisa, are you all right?

795
01:27:03.075 --> 01:27:04.367
Lisa.

796
01:27:05.742 --> 01:27:07.867
We need to get him to a doctor.

797
01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:27.450
Sasha!

798
01:27:27.492 --> 01:27:29.492
Hold out the case

799
01:27:29.533 --> 01:27:31.533
and walk over here slowly.

800
01:27:35.908 --> 01:27:37.700
There's no way out, Sasha.

801
01:30:20.075 --> 01:30:22.867
Hi, Dad. It's me.

802
01:30:39.075 --> 01:30:40.450
Dad?

803
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:47.533
Are you okay?

804
01:30:48.908 --> 01:30:50.742
I'm okay.

805
01:30:57.492 --> 01:30:59.825
I'm okay now, seeing you.

806
01:31:01.617 --> 01:31:05.700
So how they treating you?
Your foster mom?

807
01:31:05.742 --> 01:31:07.533
- Good.
- Yeah?

808
01:31:07.534 --> 01:31:09.868
She makes me soup for lunch.

809
01:31:09.869 --> 01:31:13.369
Borscht. It's pretty good.

810
01:31:14.533 --> 01:31:17.617
I bought her a TV.
And a laptop.

811
01:31:17.658 --> 01:31:21.825
- Yeah?
- Her daughter Marina lives in Moldovia.

812
01:31:21.867 --> 01:31:24.450
They can now talk online
to each other.

813
01:31:24.492 --> 01:31:27.992
- Marina's really sweet.
- Hang on a second.

814
01:31:28.033 --> 01:31:31.908
You bought her a TV
and a laptop?

815
01:31:33.575 --> 01:31:34.825
Where'd you get
that kind of money?

816
01:31:34.867 --> 01:31:37.992
- I earned it.
- You earned it?

817
01:31:38.033 --> 01:31:42.492
Well, that Russian lady,
she was kinda weird.

818
01:31:42.533 --> 01:31:45.783
She was crazy about gambling,
but she didn't know anything about boxing.

819
01:31:45.825 --> 01:31:49.158
So I offered my services, 50/50.

820
01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:52.517
You partnered up with her?

821
01:31:52.658 --> 01:31:56.450
Yeah. I ran the numbers
and she put up the money.

822
01:31:56.492 --> 01:31:59.408
And we won...
a lot, actually.

823
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:07.533
You always were the cleverest.

824
01:32:09.867 --> 01:32:11.492
Come here.

825
01:32:13.867 --> 01:32:15.950
I've missed you.

826
01:32:15.992 --> 01:32:17.700
I missed you.

827
01:32:19.917 --> 01:32:21.434
Dad?

828
01:32:21.458 --> 01:32:23.250
Yeah?

829
01:32:24.450 --> 01:32:26.575
She told me what
really happened to Mom.

830
01:32:30.742 --> 01:32:32.783
She said you tried to save her.

831
01:32:36.492 --> 01:32:38.117
It was an accident.

832
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:44.950
I just didn't know
how to tell you that.

833
01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:52.075
I didn't want you to hate me.

834
01:32:52.117 --> 01:32:54.783
It's okay, Dad, it's okay.

835
01:32:54.825 --> 01:32:58.575
I haven't been a very good
father, have I?

836
01:32:58.617 --> 01:32:59.908
You're not that bad.

837
01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:03.033
- I love you.
- I love you too.

838
01:33:03.034 --> 01:33:06.076
We're a team, remember?
You and me.

839
01:33:06.117 --> 01:33:08.617
We're a team.

840
01:33:08.658 --> 01:33:10.033
We are.

841
01:33:15.908 --> 01:33:18.658
Taxi for Boryspil Airport.

842
01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:21.908
Get me out
of this godforsaken place.

843
01:33:26.867 --> 01:33:28.742
Lisa?

844
01:33:28.783 --> 01:33:30.617
You all right?

845
01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:45.783
Does that name look familiar?

846
01:33:45.825 --> 01:33:48.533
That's just a copy.
The original is in a safe place.

847
01:33:48.534 --> 01:33:50.993
If anything happens
to me or my dad,

848
01:33:51.033 --> 01:33:52.950
it'll be sent
to all the right people.

849
01:33:55.658 --> 01:33:58.492
I know you'll find a way
to get him out of here.

850
01:34:07.492 --> 01:34:10.158
<i>Dear Lisa,
I hope you're doing fine</i>

851
01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:12.908
<i>and the foster mother
takes good care of you.</i>

852
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:17.117
<i>I will always be grateful
to you for saving my life.</i>

853
01:34:17.158 --> 01:34:19.367
<i>Inside this envelope,
you will find the name</i>

854
01:34:19.408 --> 01:34:22.950
<i>of the double agent
in the CIA-MI6 network.</i>

855
01:34:22.992 --> 01:34:24.908
<i>Please be careful.</i>

856
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:27.450
<i>Remember,
when you live among wolves,</i>

857
01:34:27.492 --> 01:34:29.075
<i>you must behave like one.</i>

858
01:34:30.658 --> 01:34:33.450
<i>Your friend, Sasha Stepanenko.</i>

859
01:34:43.867 --> 01:34:46.367
<i>Online publication
of the files in Russia</i>

860
01:34:46.408 --> 01:34:50.700
<i>has led to the largest
public protests in years.</i>

861
01:34:50.701 --> 01:34:52.576
Sasha Stepanenko,

862
01:34:52.617 --> 01:34:54.992
you've made these files public.

863
01:34:55.033 --> 01:34:56.908
The first response
from the Kremlin

864
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:59.700
is that the files are "fake news."

865
01:34:59.701 --> 01:35:01.701
What is your response to that?

866
01:35:01.742 --> 01:35:03.158
If it's fake news,

867
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.950
why don't they
permit inspections

868
01:35:04.992 --> 01:35:08.908
of the chemical weapons lab
in central Russia?

869
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:11.867
It's like we're back
in Communist times.

870
01:35:11.908 --> 01:35:14.992
The extermination program was
focusing on opposition activists

871
01:35:15.033 --> 01:35:17.575
and journalists, like my father.

872
01:35:20.783 --> 01:35:22.825
But this isn't just
a Russian problem.

873
01:35:22.867 --> 01:35:27.867
The concept of objective truth
is being threatened everywhere.

874
01:35:27.868 --> 01:35:31.574
It is really important that we,
the international press,

875
01:35:31.617 --> 01:35:35.033
stand together,
unified for free speech.

876
01:35:35.034 --> 01:35:38.826
If not, lies will be our history.

877
01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.075
- You all right, Lees?
- Yeah.

878
01:36:03.117 --> 01:36:05.533
- You hungry? Yeah?
- Yeah.

879
01:36:05.534 --> 01:36:09.868
So what about journalism?
It's a pretty cool profession, isn't it?

880
01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:12.078
I don't know,
it's mainly behind a desk.

881
01:36:12.117 --> 01:36:14.158
I mean, at the end of the day
you're just gonna be stuck

882
01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:16.158
behind a computer, aren't you?

883
01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:18.158
Yeah. But you get to travel,
get to meet people,

884
01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.033
- things like that.
- Travel?

885
01:36:20.035 --> 01:36:22.452
- Yeah.
- What's the pay like?

886
01:36:22.492 --> 01:36:25.575
Oh, come on, Lees!
It's not all about money, is it?

887
01:36:25.617 --> 01:36:28.033
- I could cover boxing.
- Yeah, you could.

888
01:36:28.075 --> 01:36:31.075
And you could also cover,
I don't know, the National Ballet.

889
01:36:55.617 --> 01:36:58.783
Kitchen is closed.
We shut at 11.

890
01:36:58.825 --> 01:37:00.408
We're open again...

891
01:37:10.984 --> 01:37:12.984
Phoenix in position.

892
01:37:13.190 --> 01:37:15.190
Proceed with the operation.
