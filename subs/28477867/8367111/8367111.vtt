[sighs] Come on,
Rollnir. We can do this.

180
00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:14.208
[grunts]

181
00:08:15.416 --> 00:08:16.708
- [Avengers cheer]
- Yes!

182
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:18.916
[chuckling] Yeah,
Thor! All right.

183
00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:33.500
Man, I am good.

184
00:08:33.583 --> 00:08:35.125
But we knew that already.

185
00:08:35.208 --> 00:08:36.791
Out of the way, Tony.

186
00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:39.416
Come on, Hulk.

187
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.750
Don't throw it this time!

188
00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:44.333
[strains, grunts]

189
00:08:44.416 --> 00:08:45.458
- What?
- Huh?

190
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.500
[giggles]

191
00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:50.833
- [pins clattering]
- Yes! Strike!

192
00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:55.833
Oh, man. Nat only
needs one more pin.

193
00:08:55.916 --> 00:08:57.833
Oh, look at that. I'm up next.

194
00:08:57.916 --> 00:08:59.375
With a chance to win.

195
00:08:59.458 --> 00:09:01.333
[chuckles] Pardon me.

196
00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:07.375
[breathes heavily]

197
00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:10.500
Uh, that ball looks heavy.

198
00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.250
I don't want you to get hurt.

199
00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:14.583
Maybe you should
try a different one.

200
00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:16.208
Dad.

201
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:17.916
And focus.

202
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Block out all
distractions and focus.

203
00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:24.041
Dad, back up. Please.

204
00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:27.500
[inhales deeply, blows]

205
00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:31.958
- Block out distractions!
- [grunts, stammers]

206
00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:38.833
Oopsie. You see?

207
00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:40.333
The ball was heavy.

208
00:09:40.416 --> 00:09:41.750
But that's okay.

209
00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:43.208
You can try again!

210
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.625
- [laughs]
- Oh, boy.

211
00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:50.375
Little Natasha, don't be
sad. And don't give up.

212
00:09:50.458 --> 00:09:51.708
You'll get it next time.

213
00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:54.541
And your papa can
be here to help you.

214
00:09:54.625 --> 00:09:55.666
Right behind you.

215
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.125
Right there with
you all the time.

216
00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:01.541
[laughs] Oh, my baby
girl. Always being so...

217
00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:04.416
Dad, stop it! Stop
pretending to be an Avenger!

218
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.500
Stop hovering over me all the
time and getting in my way!

219
00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:11.875
I-I... I'm sorry.

220
00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.500
Let me make it up to you.

221
00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:17.791
Uh, this weekend, you and your papa
can both make pancakes together.

222
00:10:17.875 --> 00:10:20.250
[stammers] Just like when
you were little, huh?

223
00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:23.250
I am not a little kid anymore.

224
00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:36.083
Hmm. That anger's
gonna eat her up.

225
00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:43.750
I can explain how to build a
quantum field Ping-Pong table,

226
00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:46.416
but I can't explain
how dads work.

227
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.166
'Cause my pops was both my biggest fan
and the biggest pain in my iron butt.

228
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.875
You wanna talk about it?

229
00:10:53.833 --> 00:10:55.750
Your angry death
glare says, "Go away."

230
00:10:55.833 --> 00:10:58.666
But you know talking about
it will make you feel better.

231
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.583
My angry death glare
doesn't work anymore?

232
00:11:01.666 --> 00:11:03.916
Oh, no. It's still a
great angry death glare.

233
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.375
Very scary.

234
00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:08.541
We're friends, Nat. You can
tell me what's going on.

235
00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:09.875
[sighs]

236
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.500
I shouldn't have yelled at him.

237
00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:15.458
But he keeps telling me
what to do, how to do it.

238
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:18.875
Treating me like a little kid.
It just makes me so angry.

239
00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.458
It's not always easy to see
where they're coming from.

240
00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:23.791
I never understood
that about my dad.

241
00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:26.416
At least not until
after he was gone.

242
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:29.583
[sighs] I didn't mean
to blow up at him.

243
00:11:29.666 --> 00:11:32.291
But he has to realize
I'm grown-up now.

244
00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:34.708
Maybe you need to tell him that.

245
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.500
[sighs]

246
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:51.541
[sighs] Why did you
have to grow up?

247
00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:53.791
Things were easier then.

248
00:11:55.416 --> 00:11:57.916
Ah, yes. I could use a hug.

249
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.833
Wait a minute. What is this?

250
00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:02.750
[grunting]

251
00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:05.208
[straining] Someone! Anyone!

252
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.291
I can't...

253
00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.833
Natasha!

254
00:12:08.916 --> 00:12:10.583
Dad. Dad!

255
00:12:10.666 --> 00:12:13.000
We need to... Dad?

256
00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:18.875
Dad?

257
00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:23.041
Dad!

258
00:12:23.833 --> 00:12:27.125
Sorry, how did we get on
the subject of Santa Claus?

259
00:12:27.208 --> 00:12:29.916
Ah, yes. The legend
of Kris Kringle.

260
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.458
One of my father's
favorite bedtime tales.

261
00:12:32.541 --> 00:12:36.958
Putting tiny little swords and axes under
the pillows of all the children of Asgard.

262
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.791
Whoa! Yeah, well, Steve over
here still believes in Santa.

263
00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:44.125
I might still hold
a candle. [chuckles]

264
00:12:44.208 --> 00:12:46.541
Please tell me you still
leave out milk and cookies.

265
00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:49.000
Let me get this straight.
We have a Norse god,

266
00:12:49.083 --> 00:12:52.125
a man whose heart powers his
armor suit, a giant green man,

267
00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:53.791
but Santa is the reach?

268
00:12:53.875 --> 00:12:55.208
That's the bridge too far?

269
00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:57.291
[grunts]

270
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:01.125
- Isn't that against the rules?
- Nope.

271
00:13:01.208 --> 00:13:02.666
Something happened to my dad.

272
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.541
I-I found his phone on the floor,
but there's no sign of him.

273
00:13:05.625 --> 00:13:08.041
Tower security didn't
log Red Guardian leaving.

274
00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:10.250
But it did just log
someone arriving.

275
00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:13.625
Red Guardian did not
leave. He was taken.

276
00:13:13.708 --> 00:13:15.041
T'Challa?

277
00:13:15.125 --> 00:13:17.125
Apologies for my
unannounced arrival.

278
00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:19.291
But I fear my most
recent investigation

279
00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:21.750
may be connected with
Black Widow's father.

280
00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:24.750
<i>I was pursuing the villain
known as Red Ghost.</i>

281
00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:30.375
Here to stop me, Black Panther?

282
00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:33.583
[laughs] Another game
of cat and mouse, is it?

283
00:13:33.666 --> 00:13:36.208
Except this time,
there is no mouse.

284
00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:39.000
There is only I, the Red Ghost.

285
00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:40.708
Drop the vibranium.

286
00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:43.291
I have better idea. Hear me out.

287
00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:45.833
- You run for your life.
- [weapon powering up]

288
00:13:45.916 --> 00:13:48.208
[laughs]

289
00:13:48.833 --> 00:13:51.458
Oh. You were so close.

290
00:13:51.541 --> 00:13:55.458
But no one gets the
drop on the Red Ghost.

291
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:57.583
- [laughs]
- [Black Panther grunts]

292
00:14:00.916 --> 00:14:04.541
By the time he gets downstairs,
I will be long gone.

293
00:14:04.625 --> 00:14:06.375
- [window shatters]
- What?

294
00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:09.000
Are you serious?

295
00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:12.750
[panting]

296
00:14:13.458 --> 00:14:14.791
[panting] Huh?

297
00:14:15.916 --> 00:14:20.083
[grunts, panting] No
one gets the drop on...

298
00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:22.333
[screams]

299
00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:30.291
[Black Panther] Red Ghost
could not have escaped

300
00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:33.000
under such mysterious
circumstances.

301
00:14:33.083 --> 00:14:36.500
And he would not have left the
vibranium behind. Not willingly.

302
00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:38.625
And you didn't see who got him?

303
00:14:38.708 --> 00:14:43.291
No. But whoever or whatever
took him left behind this.

304
00:14:43.375 --> 00:14:47.541
The material is technologically beyond
anything that we have seen on Earth.

305
00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:50.041
Red Ghost disappeared,
so did Red Guardian.

306
00:14:50.125 --> 00:14:52.500
And no one's seen any
sign of Red Skull.

307
00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:54.500
Weird coincidence.

308
00:14:54.583 --> 00:14:57.250
- [beeps]
- I have discovered a peculiar commonality

309
00:14:57.333 --> 00:14:59.291
beyond the three
missing individuals.

310
00:14:59.375 --> 00:15:00.708
- Observe.
- Whoa!

311
00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:02.625
Omega Red, Red Raven,

312
00:15:02.708 --> 00:15:05.333
Red 9, Red Stone, Red Shift,

313
00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:06.500
Red King?

314
00:15:06.583 --> 00:15:09.291
So, what's the connection?

315
00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.625
Hulk, they all have the
word "red" in their names.

316
00:15:11.708 --> 00:15:13.083
And they're all marked missing.

317
00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:15.000
- Not all of them.
- [beeps]

318
00:15:15.083 --> 00:15:16.291
[Iron Man] Red She-Hulk?

319
00:15:16.375 --> 00:15:19.125
The only superpowered individual
with "red" in their name

320
00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:20.541
who has not vanished.

321
00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:23.541
Um… I might know
where to find her.

322
00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:26.916
Good. She might be our only
lead to finding my dad.

323
00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:29.208
[Red Guardian grunting]

324
00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:31.184
- [punches landing]
- [Red Ghost] Can you get out?

325
00:15:31.208 --> 00:15:34.583
- [Red Skull grunts] No!
- [grunts]

326
00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:37.041
What is this? Where are we?

327
00:15:37.125 --> 00:15:40.375
Ah, good. You're awake.

328
00:15:40.458 --> 00:15:43.208
Red Ghost, Red
Guardian, Red Skull.

329
00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:45.875
It's nice to finally
meet you in person.

330
00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.500
And you've met my
robots already.

331
00:15:49.291 --> 00:15:50.291
Huh?

332
00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:53.291
Broken?

333
00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:54.375
Broken?

334
00:15:55.083 --> 00:15:59.666
[sighs] Bumps you down from
near mint to very fine.

335
00:16:00.166 --> 00:16:02.583
- [grunts] Not worth keeping.
- [device beeps]

336
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.875
Red Guardian.

337
00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:10.625
Not exactly a spring chicken
anymore, but I like the look of you.

338
00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:12.541
Oh, thank you.

339
00:16:12.625 --> 00:16:15.583
People think it's about
exercise, but, uh… [chuckles]

340
00:16:15.666 --> 00:16:19.291
…it really comes down to
calories in, calories out.

341
00:16:19.375 --> 00:16:23.625
Yes, you are in
magnificent condition.

342
00:16:23.708 --> 00:16:29.625
[laughing]

343
00:16:29.708 --> 00:16:31.208
[grunting]

344
00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:36.166
- [Red Skull] Stop!
- [all screaming]

345
00:16:37.916 --> 00:16:39.458
[hawk cries]

346
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.666
[Iron Man] Old West ghost town. Charming.
Didn't know these were still around.

347
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:48.166
All right, guys. When we get to Red
She-Hulk, let me do the talking.

348
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.416
Before today, I did not know
there were other Hulks out there.

349
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.083
Are you close to Red She-Hulk?

350
00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:54.791
She's my ex-girlfriend.

351
00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:57.333
Sorry. She's your ex?

352
00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:58.916
No, no, no. It's fine.

353
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.083
Betty and I ended
things on good terms.

354
00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:04.458
- [grunts]
- [Iron Man] That good, huh?

355
00:17:04.541 --> 00:17:06.791
Uh, looks like you missed
me, Betts. [chuckles]

356
00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:09.333
Maybe next time I won't, Bruce.

357
00:17:09.416 --> 00:17:10.750
What are you doing here?

358
00:17:10.833 --> 00:17:12.791
Well, um, uh...

359
00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:15.235
Well, the thing is... [stammers]
You look great, by the way.

360
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:17.416
Uh, that... Um, well…

361
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.458
[sighs] You're starting
to make me angry, Bruce.

362
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:22.041
Spit it out. [grunts]

363
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:30.500
Whatever. I'm on demo duty for my dad,
so I'm gonna get back to smashing.

364
00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:33.041
I'll go talk to her.

365
00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:35.791
Do you want me to go with you?

366
00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:37.916
- No.
- Ah, that's probably a good idea.

367
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.125
Betty, people with the word "red"
in their name are disappearing.

368
00:17:41.208 --> 00:17:42.458
Possibly being taken.

369
00:17:42.541 --> 00:17:44.000
What's that got to do with me?

370
00:17:44.083 --> 00:17:45.750
Red She-Hulk?

371
00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:47.375
- Red?
- Yeah?

372
00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:50.166
Well, nobody's disappearing me.

373
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.916
My dad is one of
the ones missing.

374
00:17:58.041 --> 00:17:59.166
Red Guardian.

375
00:17:59.666 --> 00:18:02.833
He and I got into this big
argument, and I blew up at him.

376
00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:05.791
I'm going to find
him, but... [sighs]

377
00:18:05.875 --> 00:18:08.166
Honestly, I'm still
a little mad at him.

378
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.958
Look, it's not always easy
to talk to your old man.

379
00:18:12.041 --> 00:18:13.750
My dad can be a real hothead.

380
00:18:14.291 --> 00:18:16.916
Always trying to boss me
around. Telling me what to do.

381
00:18:17.583 --> 00:18:18.875
No, my dad's different.

382
00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:23.375
He's... [stammers] He's supportive
and positive and always around.

383
00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:25.750
Then what's the problem?

384
00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:28.958
Problem is he treats
me like a little girl.

385
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.958
I'm not a kid anymore, and I don't
think my dad can accept that.

386
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:34.916
Listen, you're not perfect.
Neither is your dad.

387
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.833
You have to accept
that he's human.

388
00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:38.916
So what if he still
sees you as a kid?

389
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.916
Why does that
bother you so much?

390
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.291
[whooshing]

391
00:18:47.916 --> 00:18:49.208
Are these with you?

392
00:18:49.708 --> 00:18:51.458
- No.
- [chuckles] Good.

393
00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.625
Those would be mine.

394
00:18:53.708 --> 00:18:55.666
Sorry they aren't in
the best of shape.

395
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.541
[scoffs] Too scuffed
up to be collectibles.

396
00:18:58.625 --> 00:19:01.458
But they can do my dirty work.

397
00:19:01.541 --> 00:19:03.708
[laughs, sighs]

398
00:19:03.791 --> 00:19:06.875
What a magnificent hue.

399
00:19:07.666 --> 00:19:10.291
You're the one
responsible. Who are you?

400
00:19:10.375 --> 00:19:12.125
And what did you do with my dad?

401
00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:18.958
Oh, I'm just an extraordinary fellow who
has it all, and it's still not enough.

402
00:19:19.583 --> 00:19:21.750
I'm the Collector.

403
00:19:22.416 --> 00:19:26.333
As for the other question,
Red Guardian is now part

404
00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:31.750
of the most magnificent
collection in the known universe.

405
00:19:31.833 --> 00:19:33.416
I want him back. Now.

406
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.791
[grunts, shouts]

407
00:19:36.416 --> 00:19:37.625
[grunts]

408
00:19:38.666 --> 00:19:40.458
I love the anger.

409
00:19:40.541 --> 00:19:42.291
That is so mint.

410
00:19:42.375 --> 00:19:46.041
Don't damage the red one,
but the rest? Take 'em apart!

411
00:19:47.875 --> 00:19:49.666
- [both grunt]
- [Hulk grunts]

412
00:19:56.125 --> 00:19:57.250
All righty then.

413
00:19:57.333 --> 00:19:59.583
I'll crank up the juice
and bring the pain.

414
00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:00.875
[weapons hum]

415
00:20:03.208 --> 00:20:05.500
[grunts] Ow.

416
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.666
Keep it busy.

417
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.250
I'm gonna try something.

418
00:20:12.291 --> 00:20:15.625
[grunting, sighs]

419
00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:16.833
That all you've got?

420
00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:19.916
I've fought grandmas with
tougher stuff than you.

421
00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:22.333
[grunts]

422
00:20:23.416 --> 00:20:24.750
[grunts, shouts]

423
00:20:28.583 --> 00:20:29.583
Hey, Collector!

424
00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:31.958
Nice look. Very alt-rock.

425
00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:35.541
- How do you feel about heavy metal?
- [thunder rumbling]

426
00:20:39.166 --> 00:20:41.791
[grunts] Always
fashionably late.

427
00:20:41.875 --> 00:20:44.416
[grunting]

428
00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:47.291
[grunts]

429
00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:50.666
I'm gonna smash your ugly
face. Then your ugly face!

430
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.666
And then... Yikes,
there are a lot of you.

431
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.708
[straining]

432
00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:58.250
Don't worry, Betts!

433
00:20:58.333 --> 00:20:59.916
I got ya... [shouts]

434
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.250
[bricks clattering]

435
00:21:01.333 --> 00:21:02.791
[sighs] Typical.

436
00:21:02.875 --> 00:21:03.958
[grunts]

437
00:21:04.458 --> 00:21:05.625
[laughs]

438
00:21:06.208 --> 00:21:07.208
We need a plan.

439
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.833
Thor, call a lightning strike,
aimed at this exact location.

440
00:21:11.916 --> 00:21:13.708
But lightning? Right here?

441
00:21:13.791 --> 00:21:15.541
Won't that vaporize us?

442
00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:17.583
I mean, not me. I'd
obviously be fine.

443
00:21:17.666 --> 00:21:19.166
But the rest of you?

444
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.458
- Now, Thor!
- [grunts]

445
00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:32.125
[chuckles]

446
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.250
Nice.

447
00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:34.333
[grunts]

448
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.500
Wait. They're gone?

449
00:21:38.083 --> 00:21:41.083
And so is my only chance
at finding my dad.

450
00:21:45.041 --> 00:21:46.500
[beeps]

451
00:21:46.583 --> 00:21:48.791
No sign of the Collector
on any of our scanners.

452
00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:51.291
And nothing on the
Wakandan channels as well.

453
00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:52.791
Anyone have any ideas?

454
00:21:52.875 --> 00:21:55.875
To find him, we need
someone with special skills.

455
00:21:56.625 --> 00:21:57.625
A tracker.

456
00:21:57.708 --> 00:21:59.625
Steve and I worked
with him a while back.

457
00:21:59.708 --> 00:22:02.000
Yep. S.H.I.E.L.D. file 268.

458
00:22:02.083 --> 00:22:03.333
He can find anyone.

459
00:22:03.416 --> 00:22:05.500
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no.

460
00:22:05.583 --> 00:22:08.541
No, not that guy.
Anyone but that guy.

461
00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:10.083
He's the best at what he does.

462
00:22:10.166 --> 00:22:12.666
And what he does
isn't very nice.

463
00:22:16.416 --> 00:22:18.666
- [sizzling]
- [snikt]

464
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:19.750
[Black Widow] Wolverine.

465
00:22:21.666 --> 00:22:25.125
[groans] Guess I'm not
gonna get to eat my lunch.

466
00:22:29.625 --> 00:22:31.000
[sniffs, groans]

467
00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:32.166
Stay on this heading.

468
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:36.041
You can track the Collector from
this high up, at this distance?

469
00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:37.875
My nose doesn't lie.

470
00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:42.541
Collector might be untraceable,
but Red She-Hulk leaves a scent.

471
00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:44.958
I can smell a Hulk
from a mile away.

472
00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:46.750
- [growls]
- What?

473
00:22:46.833 --> 00:22:50.416
Maybe try smashing a deodorant
factory once in a while.

474
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.041
[sniffs] Take us down
here. This is it.

475
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:04.791
[sniffs]

476
00:23:05.375 --> 00:23:06.375
Over here.

477
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.500
[sniffs]

478
00:23:11.583 --> 00:23:13.250
Do you have a lock on my dad?

479
00:23:13.333 --> 00:23:16.041
[sniffs] Picking
up multiple scents.

480
00:23:16.125 --> 00:23:17.333
Red She-Hulk and...

481
00:23:17.416 --> 00:23:19.166
[sniffs] Wait a second...

482
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.000
[sniffs] Red Skull?

483
00:23:21.083 --> 00:23:24.833
The plan is to free everyone
from the Collector. Everyone.

484
00:23:24.916 --> 00:23:27.875
You didn't say anything
about saving villains.

485
00:23:27.958 --> 00:23:32.791
For all I care, the Collector can
keep the Red Ghost and Red Skull and…

486
00:23:32.875 --> 00:23:34.541
[sniffs, grunts]

487
00:23:34.625 --> 00:23:35.916
Omega Red?

488
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.916
- You know him?
- [grunts]

489
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.166
Omega Red is the worst.

490
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.625
He just sucks the
life out of you.

491
00:23:42.708 --> 00:23:44.125
Just get us to the Collector.

492
00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:46.041
[groans] Follow me.

493
00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:51.333
The place is called Mom's
Diner. That's just adorable.

494
00:23:51.416 --> 00:23:53.250
It's probably a death trap.

495
00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:55.213
Can't be worse than where
you get your hair cut.

496
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.250
[groans]

497
00:23:56.333 --> 00:23:58.666
- [bell dings]
- Scent ends here.

498
00:24:03.083 --> 00:24:04.083
Spread out.

499
00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:06.166
Look for a hidden door or exit.

500
00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:24.416
- Anybody want lemonade?
- [clicks]

501
00:24:29.583 --> 00:24:31.583
Collector'll be down there,

502
00:24:31.666 --> 00:24:33.083
in Mom's basement.

503
00:24:37.916 --> 00:24:39.851
[Iron Man] Definitely
doesn't look like Earth tech.

504
00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:42.458
Hmm. I don't see any way down.

505
00:24:44.291 --> 00:24:46.750
[Iron Man] That's
convenient. And ominous.

506
00:24:49.666 --> 00:24:51.791
My scanners have picked
up a hidden passageway

507
00:24:51.875 --> 00:24:53.875
to a deeper sublevel beneath us.

508
00:24:53.958 --> 00:24:54.958
This way.

509
00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:01.541
I'm coming, Dad.

510
00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:05.375
There better not
be any secret door.

511
00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:07.791
I hate secret doors.

512
00:25:07.875 --> 00:25:09.476

complete. Identify and sort.</i>

528
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.291
<i>Two armored robots with
scratches and surface damage.</i>

529
00:25:53.375 --> 00:25:55.375
- <i>Imperfect.</i>
- [Iron Man] Imperfect?

530
00:25:55.458 --> 00:25:56.708
- [shouts]
- [Black Widow] Tony!

531
00:25:56.791 --> 00:25:59.500
[computer voice] <i>Identify
and sort. Four humans.</i>

532
00:25:59.583 --> 00:26:01.250
<i>Identify and sort.</i>

533
00:26:01.333 --> 00:26:02.375
<i>Two animals.</i>

534
00:26:02.458 --> 00:26:04.125
[both] Excuse me?

535
00:26:04.208 --> 00:26:05.750
[all shouting]

536
00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:07.375
[grunts]

537
00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:09.791
- [Hulk grunts]
- [groans]

538
00:26:13.916 --> 00:26:17.541
[groans] This entire
room stinks like…

539
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.458
[sniffs] Oh, no.

540
00:26:19.541 --> 00:26:21.166
[growling]

541
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.583
Is that a…

542
00:26:22.666 --> 00:26:25.500
Wendigo! [growls]

543
00:26:26.041 --> 00:26:27.083
[Wolverine grunts]

544
00:26:27.166 --> 00:26:30.083
- [growls]
- [roars]

545
00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:31.458
[both grunting]

546
00:26:35.833 --> 00:26:37.416
- [chuckles] Soft.
- [growling]

547
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.458
- Like wrestling a big, fluffy pillow.
- [groans]

548
00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:43.000
- [Wendigo growls]
- Uh-oh.

549
00:26:43.083 --> 00:26:44.791
Fluffy pillow's fightin' back.

550
00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:46.458
- [Wendigo growling]
- [groans]

551
00:26:49.666 --> 00:26:52.458
Hate stupid fluffy pillow!

552
00:26:52.541 --> 00:26:55.083
- [growls]
- [Wolverine grunts]

553
00:26:55.166 --> 00:26:56.458
[Wendigo growls]

554
00:26:56.541 --> 00:26:58.041
[groans, grunts]

555
00:27:01.875 --> 00:27:03.916
- [snikt]
- [growls]

556
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.333
Okay, bub, you've
taken your best shot.

557
00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:08.958
Now, it's my turn.

558
00:27:09.041 --> 00:27:11.416
[Wendigo growling]

559
00:27:12.625 --> 00:27:14.750
[Wolverine groaning, grunting]

560
00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.208
[growls]

561
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:17.375
[Wendigo yelps]

562
00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:18.666
[grunts]

563
00:27:19.958 --> 00:27:22.666
[both panting]

564
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.750
[Hulk] Wasn't as
bad as I remembered.

565
00:27:24.833 --> 00:27:26.833
- [groans]
- You did pretty good there.

566
00:27:26.916 --> 00:27:29.875
[groans] Aw, thanks, man.

567
00:27:29.958 --> 00:27:32.916
[chuckles] I think I
pulled a muscle, but...

568
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.416
[growling]

569
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.666
[Hulk] More fluffy pillows!

570
00:27:38.166 --> 00:27:39.875
I hate fluffy pillows.

571
00:27:41.541 --> 00:27:42.791
[both screaming]

572
00:27:42.875 --> 00:27:44.500
[both groan]

573
00:27:45.416 --> 00:27:47.291
I did not see that coming.

574
00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:50.375
[machinery humming]

575
00:27:50.458 --> 00:27:51.958
Where's the rest of our team?

576
00:27:52.041 --> 00:27:55.125
- And why did the Collector send us here?
- We were scanned.

577
00:27:55.208 --> 00:27:58.583
The computer said we were
scratched and damaged.

578
00:27:58.666 --> 00:28:00.541
They thought we were scrap.

579
00:28:00.625 --> 00:28:01.916
They underestimated us.

580
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.625
My scanners cannot find an exit.

581
00:28:04.708 --> 00:28:07.250
[scanner beeping]

582
00:28:09.666 --> 00:28:11.625
No exit? Not a problem.

583
00:28:11.708 --> 00:28:13.083
We're gonna build our way out.

584
00:28:13.708 --> 00:28:15.833
[all screaming, groan]

585
00:28:15.916 --> 00:28:18.208
[groans] What are these things?

586
00:28:18.291 --> 00:28:20.208
Power-inhibiting manacles.

587
00:28:20.291 --> 00:28:21.750
Uh, they jam our powers.

588
00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:24.125
These must be a newer model.

589
00:28:24.958 --> 00:28:27.791
What? Have you never been
captured, thrown in prison

590
00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:30.000
and had your powers
taken away before?

591
00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:31.791
- Nope.
- Nuh-uh.

592
00:28:31.875 --> 00:28:32.958
Can't say that I have.

593
00:28:33.041 --> 00:28:34.708
Just me? Huh.

594
00:28:34.791 --> 00:28:37.416
It's happened to me more
times than I care to...

595
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.458
Really? Like, never?

596
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:41.291
[footsteps approaching]

597
00:28:46.833 --> 00:28:49.666
Well, we found robots,
but not our friends.

598
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.000
[Collector] Friends?

599
00:28:51.083 --> 00:28:52.916
Who cares about them?

600
00:28:53.708 --> 00:28:56.500
Check out my advanced bots.

601
00:28:56.583 --> 00:28:59.583
You may have bested my
old ones in the desert,

602
00:28:59.666 --> 00:29:02.208
but these are a bit more sturdy.

603
00:29:03.083 --> 00:29:06.916
Oh, the rare treasures
you're about to see.

604
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.875
I don't care about any of this.

605
00:29:08.958 --> 00:29:10.416
I want my dad.

606
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.916
I'll take you to him.

607
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.333
Maybe along the way, you
could learn some manners.

608
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:20.500
This is the magic.

609
00:29:20.583 --> 00:29:23.416
You see, when you get to
be as big a deal as I am,

610
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.541
it's all about
rare, one-of-a-kind,

611
00:29:27.625 --> 00:29:30.958
never made available
to the public before.

612
00:29:31.041 --> 00:29:31.916
- [all gasp]
- Whoa.

613
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.291
Behold, my collection.

614
00:29:36.375 --> 00:29:37.500
[lights clicking]

615
00:29:37.583 --> 00:29:39.226
The greatest ever,
complete, mint-condition,

616
00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.541
sealed and climate-controlled
acid-free Mylar.

617
00:29:43.083 --> 00:29:45.250
My good stuff is in storage,

618
00:29:45.333 --> 00:29:48.625
but this is the best of what
I've acquired here on Earth.

619
00:29:48.708 --> 00:29:52.041
[giggling] Oh, you are going
to be impressed by this.

620
00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:57.250
My mythical creatures of legend!

621
00:29:57.333 --> 00:29:58.333
Are they dead?

622
00:29:58.416 --> 00:30:00.625
[scoffs] Of course not.

623
00:30:00.708 --> 00:30:03.208
Suspended animation.

624
00:30:03.291 --> 00:30:08.791
Hibernation stasis, in
absolute mint condition.

625
00:30:11.458 --> 00:30:13.916
You kidnapped Santa Claus?

626
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.083
I knew he was real.

627
00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:17.375
Come on, come on. I have
so much more to show you.

628
00:30:17.458 --> 00:30:19.750
[groans] Hey, wait. Don't
you know who that is?

629
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.125
After completing those, I
tried collecting musicians,

630
00:30:23.208 --> 00:30:25.500
but you have no
idea how hard it is

631
00:30:25.583 --> 00:30:27.875
to find rock stars in
halfway-decent condition.

632
00:30:27.958 --> 00:30:29.500
So, I branched out.

633
00:30:29.583 --> 00:30:34.000
Feast your eyes on my
latest and greatest.

634
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.833
My Red Collection!

635
00:30:39.541 --> 00:30:40.916
[Black Widow gasps]

636
00:30:42.791 --> 00:30:43.791
Dad!

637
00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:45.791
[groaning, grunting]

638
00:30:45.875 --> 00:30:46.875
Let go of me!

639
00:30:46.958 --> 00:30:49.583
The first color of the rainbow.

640
00:30:49.666 --> 00:30:51.416
Soon to be followed by others.

641
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.041
Although, it thins out
between green and purple.

642
00:30:54.541 --> 00:30:56.041
Not sure why.

643
00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:58.208
Collector, you're
completely mad.

644
00:30:58.291 --> 00:31:02.666
I'm super mad at you
ungrateful casuals.

645
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:06.541
You don't appreciate the
greatness in my collection.

646
00:31:07.375 --> 00:31:11.125
That's why I've
decided to collect you.

647
00:31:11.208 --> 00:31:14.083
[all groaning]

648
00:31:14.166 --> 00:31:15.583
Relax.

649
00:31:15.666 --> 00:31:18.041
You'll be in a protective slab.

650
00:31:18.125 --> 00:31:20.125
Frozen in stasis.

651
00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:24.041
[grunts] Perfect forever.

652
00:31:26.583 --> 00:31:29.000
- Sam, can you fly out?
- [Sam straining]

653
00:31:29.083 --> 00:31:32.416
No can do! These inhibitors
have everything shut down.

654
00:31:33.583 --> 00:31:36.250
- [thud]
- [groans] Huh?

655
00:31:39.083 --> 00:31:41.541
You'll be part of my
latest collection.

656
00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:43.750
My Avengers Collection.

657
00:31:46.125 --> 00:31:47.125
Dad.

658
00:31:47.541 --> 00:31:50.125
What about Red Guardian? Where
are you going to put him?

659
00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:52.708
He's already in
my Red Collection.

660
00:31:52.791 --> 00:31:54.833
Then your collection's
incomplete.

661
00:31:54.916 --> 00:31:56.708
If Red Guardian's with the Reds,

662
00:31:56.791 --> 00:31:59.583
then your Avengers Collection
will always have a hole in it.

663
00:31:59.666 --> 00:32:01.833
What? What are
you talking about?

664
00:32:01.916 --> 00:32:03.916
Red Guardian is red.

665
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.416
Red Guardian is an Avenger.

666
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.083
No, he can't be...
You... [scoffs]

667
00:32:09.166 --> 00:32:10.958
But he just... Fine, whatever.

668
00:32:11.041 --> 00:32:13.625
- I'll just put him in both sets.
- Well, you can't do that.

669
00:32:13.708 --> 00:32:15.791
He's either in one
collection or the other,

670
00:32:15.875 --> 00:32:18.625
but one of them will
never be complete.

671
00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:21.291
No! I have to file
him under something!

672
00:32:21.375 --> 00:32:25.875
Do you have any idea how many spreadsheets
I have to keep track of all this?

673
00:32:27.375 --> 00:32:29.625
[rumbling]

674
00:32:29.708 --> 00:32:31.458
Wait, that's not the machine.

675
00:32:34.625 --> 00:32:36.333
Nobody puts us in the trash.

676
00:32:37.958 --> 00:32:40.583
- [shouts]
- At worst, we belong in recycling.

677
00:32:42.416 --> 00:32:43.833
Told you they were here.

678
00:32:43.916 --> 00:32:45.916
The nose never lies.

679
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.875
- What happened?
- [spits]

680
00:32:47.958 --> 00:32:51.208
I don't wanna talk
about it. [grunting]

681
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:52.833
[Wolverine grunting]

682
00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:55.750
[groans]

683
00:32:59.875 --> 00:33:02.458
I think it's time to
collect a little payback.

684
00:33:03.875 --> 00:33:06.500
- [all grunting]
- Strike!

685
00:33:26.208 --> 00:33:27.416
Do your thing, Wolverine.

686
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.083
[grunting]

687
00:33:30.166 --> 00:33:32.458
[groans] Where are we?

688
00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:35.708
Okay, you're inside the lair of
an alien who... No, you know what?

689
00:33:35.791 --> 00:33:38.791
Someone will explain later. Right
now, we just need you to smash.

690
00:33:38.875 --> 00:33:39.875
I can manage that.

691
00:33:41.125 --> 00:33:43.250
Oh, and Santa is real!

692
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.583
Santa's real, everybody.

693
00:33:48.125 --> 00:33:49.416
[gasps] Dad.

694
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.375
[laser blasting]

695
00:33:53.458 --> 00:33:54.458
[beeps]

696
00:34:00.875 --> 00:34:03.375
[blades whirring]

697
00:34:04.541 --> 00:34:07.375
[roars]

698
00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:08.875
Uh-oh.

699
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.291
[roars]

700
00:34:16.166 --> 00:34:17.916
And that's how it's done.

701
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.125
You miss me, Betts?

702
00:34:19.208 --> 00:34:22.000
[giggles] Maybe. Just a little.

703
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.625
Rescuing you feels wrong.

704
00:34:27.708 --> 00:34:29.666
Omega Red?

705
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.041
Forget it. [groans]

706
00:34:32.125 --> 00:34:35.250
You're gonna try to convince me
this is the right thing to do.

707
00:34:35.333 --> 00:34:37.666
I don't have to.
You already know it.

708
00:34:40.125 --> 00:34:41.125
[grunts]

709
00:34:41.916 --> 00:34:45.625
[gasps] My greatest foe!

710
00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:47.708
I knew you'd come!

711
00:34:47.791 --> 00:34:49.625
[laughs, snorts]

712
00:34:50.291 --> 00:34:54.291
Wait till I tell Sabretooth,
Deathstrike and Cyber, huh?

713
00:34:54.375 --> 00:34:56.375
They're never going
to believe it.

714
00:34:56.458 --> 00:35:00.333
Old Wolvie has a heart
after all, am I right?

715
00:35:00.416 --> 00:35:04.125
[giggles] We should take a
picture to commemorate this.

716
00:35:04.208 --> 00:35:06.583
Hey, does anyone have
a phone we can borrow

717
00:35:06.666 --> 00:35:08.666
and maybe, like, a selfie stick?

718
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.750
[groans] You are so exhausting.

719
00:35:11.833 --> 00:35:15.208
[gasps] My collection!

720
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:17.166
My life's work!

721
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.916
They're... They're opening it!

722
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.250
[groans] Wish I had time
to do an unboxing video,

723
00:35:23.333 --> 00:35:26.708
but I need to stop them
before they ruin everything!

724
00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:29.125
[grunting]

725
00:35:32.458 --> 00:35:33.458
There.

726
00:35:34.791 --> 00:35:36.125
[grunting]

727
00:35:38.291 --> 00:35:41.208
- [weapon powering up]
- [grunting]

728
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.125
Hold on, Dad. [groaning]

729
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:50.500
Whoa.

730
00:35:50.583 --> 00:35:53.625
Natasha, you managed to save me?

731
00:35:53.708 --> 00:35:55.291
Dad, I...

732
00:35:55.375 --> 00:35:56.375
What is it?

733
00:35:56.458 --> 00:35:57.916
- [rumbling]
- [groans]

734
00:35:58.708 --> 00:36:00.000
[Red Guardian groans]

735
00:36:00.083 --> 00:36:02.375
- Dad! [grunts]
- [groans]

736
00:36:03.333 --> 00:36:05.833
[Black Widow grunting]

737
00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:08.791
[grunts] Drop me. I'm too heavy.

738
00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:11.083
No! I can rescue you.

739
00:36:11.166 --> 00:36:14.250
[pants] Why... Why
won't you trust me?

740
00:36:14.333 --> 00:36:16.375
Of course I trust you.

741
00:36:16.458 --> 00:36:20.208
But I'm your papa. It's
my job to protect you.

742
00:36:20.291 --> 00:36:22.291
And I'm scared for you.

743
00:36:22.375 --> 00:36:23.583
I'm scared too.

744
00:36:24.083 --> 00:36:27.166
Papa, I think you liked me
better when I was little,

745
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.791
but I'm not a kid anymore.

746
00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:31.833
And I'm scared you don't
love me for who I am now.

747
00:36:31.916 --> 00:36:35.125
Natasha, I could
never stop loving you.

748
00:36:35.208 --> 00:36:39.000
I know I hover around like a
helicopter, but I can't help it.

749
00:36:39.083 --> 00:36:43.166
You're so grown up, and
you don't need me anymore.

750
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:45.916
I don't know how else
to spend time with you.

751
00:36:48.291 --> 00:36:50.333
- [straining]
- [groans]

752
00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:52.250
It was so much simpler then.

753
00:36:52.875 --> 00:36:54.708
Remember when you were little?

754
00:36:55.208 --> 00:36:58.166
[laughing] You and I used
to make pancakes together.

755
00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:59.625
We still can.

756
00:36:59.708 --> 00:37:02.458
But, Papa, you need to let go.

757
00:37:02.541 --> 00:37:04.083
You want me to let go?

758
00:37:04.166 --> 00:37:05.583
No! No, no.

759
00:37:05.666 --> 00:37:08.750
You have to let go of the
idea that I'm a little girl.

760
00:37:08.833 --> 00:37:10.250
[beeping]

761
00:37:10.333 --> 00:37:11.666
[weapons powering up]

762
00:37:12.958 --> 00:37:14.375
Coming through!

763
00:37:15.583 --> 00:37:18.416
- [Black Widow grunting, groans]
- [Red Guardian grunts]

764
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.833
Goodness, you're so strong now.

765
00:37:22.458 --> 00:37:25.500
[laughing] My Natasha.

766
00:37:28.916 --> 00:37:31.083
Must be something
else I can use.

767
00:37:31.166 --> 00:37:32.375
Something that'll...

768
00:37:32.458 --> 00:37:34.208
Oh, this will do.

769
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.500
[beeps]

770
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:41.000
[roars]

771
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
[groans]

772
00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:46.291
Is this the right way?

773
00:37:46.375 --> 00:37:47.375
[shouts]

774
00:37:48.416 --> 00:37:49.500
[Hulk grunts]

775
00:37:51.291 --> 00:37:52.291
[Wolverine] Heads up!

776
00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:58.875
- [grunts]
- [dragon roaring]

777
00:37:58.958 --> 00:38:00.083
What the...

778
00:38:00.583 --> 00:38:02.166
- [shouts]
- [grunts]

779
00:38:04.916 --> 00:38:06.166
[roars]

780
00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.250
Get down!

781
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.666
[roaring]

782
00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:14.541
- [interface beeps]
- Game on.

783
00:38:19.916 --> 00:38:22.541
[grunting]

784
00:38:22.625 --> 00:38:25.333
[Santa] Ho ho ho!

785
00:38:25.416 --> 00:38:26.916
Hi-yah!

786
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.833
[gasps] Did you like the
milk and cookies, Santa?

787
00:38:32.916 --> 00:38:35.500
Of course, I did, Steven.

788
00:38:35.583 --> 00:38:37.875
You've always been a good boy.

789
00:38:38.375 --> 00:38:39.708
Now, come along.

790
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:43.041
Time to kick some
butt, North Pole style.

791
00:38:43.125 --> 00:38:44.833
For the elves!

792
00:38:44.916 --> 00:38:47.791
- [groans]
- Santa! No!

793
00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:52.625
Ho! Nice try, dragon!

794
00:38:52.708 --> 00:38:54.416
But you've met your match.

795
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.166
If I tamed Rudolph,
I can tame you!

796
00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:02.958
- [grunting, laughs] Ho ho!
- [dragon growls]

797
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.250
Do you want to
finish this together?

798
00:39:11.333 --> 00:39:12.583
Are you sure?

799
00:39:12.666 --> 00:39:14.416
I'm not intruding?

800
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:15.958
You're not intruding, Papa.

801
00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:18.291
Like I told the Collector,
you're an Avenger.

802
00:39:20.333 --> 00:39:21.916
[pants, grunting]

803
00:39:22.625 --> 00:39:24.708
[grunting] Yeah!

804
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:29.375
[laughs] Flip it, flatten it,
just like making pancakes!

805
00:39:29.458 --> 00:39:31.500
Oh, you're doing great, Natasha!

806
00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:33.458
You make me proud!

807
00:39:34.333 --> 00:39:36.208
[Collector] Get away from there!

808
00:39:36.291 --> 00:39:37.333
[groans]

809
00:39:37.416 --> 00:39:38.458
Let him go!

810
00:39:38.541 --> 00:39:40.125
- [grunts]
- [Collector groans]

811
00:39:40.833 --> 00:39:46.583
[grunts] That machine is more
important than life itself.

812
00:39:46.666 --> 00:39:48.791
All it does is lock people up.

813
00:39:48.875 --> 00:39:51.291
No! It protects them!

814
00:39:51.375 --> 00:39:52.916
Can't you see?

815
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.833
If we don't keep things in
mint condition, they change.

816
00:39:56.916 --> 00:39:59.791
But locked in a bubble,
they won't change!

817
00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:01.916
They stay perfect!

818
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.458
Stay perfect?

819
00:40:06.166 --> 00:40:08.583
So what if it changes?

820
00:40:08.666 --> 00:40:10.375
Still perfect.

821
00:40:11.125 --> 00:40:13.000
[grunts]

822
00:40:13.083 --> 00:40:14.583
No, no, no!

823
00:40:18.708 --> 00:40:19.708
My stuff!

824
00:40:22.208 --> 00:40:24.958
[groans] I hate this place!

825
00:40:25.041 --> 00:40:27.000
I hate this planet!

826
00:40:27.083 --> 00:40:29.291
I hate everything!

827
00:40:30.125 --> 00:40:32.958
Computer, we're leaving!

828
00:40:34.166 --> 00:40:36.125
[rumbling, cracking]

829
00:40:37.208 --> 00:40:39.708
[all screaming, panting]

830
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:41.541
[Omega Red] I have
to get out of here!

831
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:45.291
Huh?

832
00:40:45.875 --> 00:40:47.875
[rumbling]

833
00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:54.750
Am I dizzy, or is
the room moving?

834
00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:57.958
Worse than that. It's rising.
We need to get out of here.

835
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.291
Panther and I have it.

836
00:41:05.125 --> 00:41:06.708
Hit the eject... Now!

837
00:41:12.583 --> 00:41:14.291
- [Black Panther giggles]
- Path is clear!

838
00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:15.625
Everybody, out!

839
00:41:28.583 --> 00:41:29.833
[groaning]

840
00:41:40.875 --> 00:41:42.125
[all cheer]

841
00:41:42.208 --> 00:41:44.041
Whoa! You can't touch this.

842
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.875
[shutter clicks]

843
00:41:53.833 --> 00:41:55.416
[Steve] All the
bad guys secured.

844
00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.666
You did the right
thing by saving them.

845
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.166
And you made a new friend.

846
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.666
Yoo-hoo! Wolvie!

847
00:42:02.833 --> 00:42:04.833
- [groans]
- [both chuckling]

848
00:42:08.333 --> 00:42:09.791
[both laugh]

849
00:42:15.958 --> 00:42:18.041
[Hulk giggles] Yeah.

850
00:42:19.125 --> 00:42:21.958
- [Avengers chattering]
- Actually, this was, uh, Jarvis's recipe.

851
00:42:22.583 --> 00:42:23.583
More, please.

852
00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:25.416
Whoa, you got chocolate
chips in this?

853
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.250
- They're amazing.
- What is your recipe?

854
00:42:27.333 --> 00:42:29.583
These are the best pancakes
we've ever made, Dad.

855
00:42:30.625 --> 00:42:34.000
- [burps, laughs]
- [laughs]

856
00:42:34.083 --> 00:42:37.750
Have some more! There is
plenty for all. [laughs]

857
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.416
It's mine! I don't wanna share!

858
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.166
No. I'm not done with it yet.

859
00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.041
You're the worst!

860
00:42:49.125 --> 00:42:51.416
- No, you're the worst!
- [bells jingle]

861
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.250
- [gasps]
- Santa!

862
00:42:53.333 --> 00:42:54.875
It's Santa Cl... [groans]

863
00:42:54.958 --> 00:42:58.458
Fighting over toys will get
you on the naughty list!

864
00:42:58.541 --> 00:43:01.625
- Ho ho ho!
- [roars]

865
00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.125
[both scream]
