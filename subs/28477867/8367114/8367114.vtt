1
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:30.041
Your usual.

2
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.500
With ghost peppers
and extra sriracha.

3
00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:35.125
Hooray! My hot, hot dog.

4
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:41.958
Milk will put out that fire.

5
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.666
See you again tomorrow.

6
00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:49.291
Give it!

7
00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:50.708
Let go!

8
00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:55.000
Oh, great! Thanks a lot.

9
00:00:55.083 --> 00:00:56.666
Look what you did!

10
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.083
You were
the one pulling.

11
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.833
This is your fault.

12
00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:02.583
Well, it's broken now.

13
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.708
I don't want it.

14
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:05.083
Just leave it.

15
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.125
It's ruined.

16
00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:08.541
Huh? Whoa!

17
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.958
Oh, what on Earth?

18
00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:27.541
Citizens of New York, surrender!

19
00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:29.333
For we have…

20
00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:32.096
All I'm hearing is mumbles.

21
00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.767
- I don't hear anything.
- I can't hear anything!

22
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:36.476
What's he saying?

23
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.708
Now, bow before your new
overlords, Red Skull and Hydra!

24
00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:46.125
Uh, sorry! Uh, we couldn't
hear you down here!

25
00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:47.750
What'd you say your name was?

26
00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:50.625
I am the Red Skull!

27
00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:52.291
Ooh, isn't it obvious?

28
00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:55.166
From the red? And the skull?

29
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.083
My skull, look,
it's red. Red Skull!

30
00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:00.416
What? Louder!

31
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.458
We can't hear you!

32
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:03.875
Quickly, the megaphone.

33
00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.375
Ow!

34
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:08.833
Not for throwing.

35
00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:10.625
For talking, dummkopf.

36
00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:11.875
Ah! Never mind!

37
00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.833
Attack!

38
00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:26.750
I am Red Skull! And
this city is now mine.

39
00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:28.333
Your newspapers are mine.

40
00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:30.125
Your phones are mine.

41
00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:32.333
Your hot dogs are mine!

42
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500
You put ghost peppers on this.

43
00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:42.625
What is wrong with you people?

44
00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:43.750
Water!

45
00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:45.083
Water!

46
00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:47.458
Ooh, boss. Water will just make it worse.

47
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:48.625
Milk then!

48
00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:51.125
Someone blew up the milk truck.

49
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:57.458
Attack again!

50
00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:03.958
Ah, the sweet sound of victory.

51
00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:06.250
Huh? What is that?

52
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:09.291
Oof! Ooh.

53
00:03:17.083 --> 00:03:18.750
Again with the Hydra?

54
00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:21.041

We'll get him next time.

118

00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:50.833
Yes! Strike!

157
00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:55.833
Oh, man. Nat only
needs one more pin.

158
00:08:55.916 --> 00:08:57.833
Oh, look at that. I'm up next.

159

With a chance to win.

160
00:08:59.458 --> 00:09:01.333
Pardon me.

161
00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:10.500
Uh, that ball looks heavy.

162
00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.250
I don't want you to get hurt.

163
00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:14.583
Maybe you should
try a different one.

164
00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:16.208
Dad.

165
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:17.916
And focus.

166
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Block out all
distractions and focus.

167
00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:24.041
Dad, back up. Please.

168
00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:31.958

170
00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:40.333

171
00:09:40.416 --> 00:09:41.750
But that's okay.

Oh, boy.

174
00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:50.375
Little Natasha, don't be
sad. And don't give up.

You'll get it next time.

00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:17.791
Uh, this weekend, you and your papa
can both make pancakes together.

185
00:10:17.875 --> 00:10:20.250
Just like when
you were little, huh?

186
00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:23.250
I am not a little kid anymore.

187
00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:36.083
Hmm. That anger's
gonna eat her up.

188
00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:43.750
I can explain how to build a
quantum field Ping-Pong table,

189
00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:46.416
but I can't explain
how dads work.

190
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.166
'Cause my pops was both my biggest fan
and the biggest pain in my iron butt.

191
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.875
You wanna talk about it?

192
00:10:53.833 --> 00:10:55.750
Your angry death
glare says, "Go away."

193
00:10:55.833 --> 00:10:58.666
But you know talking about
it will make you feel better.

194
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.583
My angry death glare
doesn't work anymore?

195
00:11:01.666 --> 00:11:03.916
Oh, no. It's still a
great angry death glare.

196
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.375
Very scary.

197
00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:08.541
We're friends, Nat. You can
tell me what's going on.

198
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.500
I shouldn't have yelled at him.

199
00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:15.458
But he keeps telling me
what to do, how to do it.

200
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:18.875
Treating me like a little kid.
It just makes me so angry.

201
00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.458
It's not always easy to see
where they're coming from.

202
00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:23.791
I never understood
that about my dad.

203
00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:26.416
At least not until
after he was gone.

204
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:29.583
I didn't mean
to blow up at him.

205
00:11:29.666 --> 00:11:32.291
But he has to realize
I'm grown-up now.

206
00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:34.708
Maybe you need to tell him that.

207
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:51.541
Why did you
have to grow up?

208
00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:53.791
Things were easier then.

209
00:11:55.416 --> 00:11:57.916
Ah, yes. I could use a hug.

210
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.833
Wait a minute. What is this?

211
00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:05.208
Someone! Anyone!

212
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.291
I can't...

213
00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.833
Natasha!

214
00:12:08.916 --> 00:12:10.583
Dad. Dad!

215
00:12:10.666 --> 00:12:13.000
We need to... Dad?

216
00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:18.875
Dad?

217
00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:23.041
Dad!

218
00:12:23.833 --> 00:12:27.125
Sorry, how did we get on
the subject of Santa Claus?

219
00:12:27.208 --> 00:12:29.916
Ah, yes. The legend
of Kris Kringle.

220
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.458
One of my father's
favorite bedtime tales.

221
00:12:32.541 --> 00:12:36.958
Putting tiny little swords and axes under
the pillows of all the children of Asgard.

222
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.791
Whoa! Yeah, well, Steve over
here still believes in Santa.

223
00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:44.125
I might still hold
a candle.

224
00:12:44.208 --> 00:12:46.541
Please tell me you still
leave out milk and cookies.

225
00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:49.000
Let me get this straight.
We have a Norse god,

226
00:12:49.083 --> 00:12:52.125
a man whose heart powers his
armor suit, a giant green man,

227
00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:53.791
but Santa is the reach?

228
00:12:53.875 --> 00:12:55.208
That's the bridge too far?

229
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:01.125
- Isn't that against the rules?
- Nope.

230
00:13:01.208 --> 00:13:02.666
Something happened to my dad.

231
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.541
I-I found his phone on the floor,
but there's no sign of him.

232
00:13:05.625 --> 00:13:08.041
Tower security didn't
log Red Guardian leaving.

233
00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:10.250
But it did just log
someone arriving.

234
00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:13.625
Red Guardian did not
leave. He was taken.

235
00:13:13.708 --> 00:13:15.041
T'Challa?

236
00:13:15.125 --> 00:13:17.125
Apologies for my
unannounced arrival.

237
00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:19.291
But I fear my most
recent investigation

238
00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:21.750
may be connected with
Black Widow's father.

239
00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:24.750
<i>I was pursuing the villain
known as Red Ghost.</i>

240
00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:30.375
Here to stop me, Black Panther?

241
00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:33.583
Another game
of cat and mouse, is it?

242
00:13:33.666 --> 00:13:36.208
Except this time,
there is no mouse.

243
00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:39.000
There is only I, the Red Ghost.

244
00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:40.708
Drop the vibranium.

245
00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:43.291
I have better idea. Hear me out.

246
00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:45.833
You run for your life.

247
00:13:48.833 --> 00:13:51.458
Oh. You were so close.

248
00:13:51.541 --> 00:13:55.458
But no one gets the
drop on the Red Ghost.

249
00:14:00.916 --> 00:14:04.541
By the time he gets downstairs,
I will be long gone.

250
00:14:04.625 --> 00:14:06.375
What?

251
00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:09.000
Are you serious?

252
00:14:13.458 --> 00:14:14.791
Huh?

253
00:14:15.916 --> 00:14:20.083
No
one gets the drop on...

254
00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:30.291
Red Ghost
could not have escaped

255
00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:33.000
under such mysterious
circumstances.

256
00:14:33.083 --> 00:14:36.500
And he would not have left the
vibranium behind. Not willingly.

257
00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:38.625
And you didn't see who got him?

258
00:14:38.708 --> 00:14:43.291
No. But whoever or whatever
took him left behind this.

259
00:14:43.375 --> 00:14:47.541
The material is technologically beyond
anything that we have seen on Earth.

260
00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:50.041
Red Ghost disappeared,
so did Red Guardian.

261
00:14:50.125 --> 00:14:52.500
And no one's seen any
sign of Red Skull.

262
00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:54.500
Weird coincidence.

263
00:14:54.583 --> 00:14:57.250
I have discovered a peculiar commonality

264
00:14:57.333 --> 00:14:59.291
beyond the three
missing individuals.

265
00:14:59.375 --> 00:15:00.708
- Observe.
- Whoa!

266
00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:02.625
Omega Red, Red Raven,

267
00:15:02.708 --> 00:15:05.333
Red 9, Red Stone, Red Shift,

268
00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:06.500
Red King?

269
00:15:06.583 --> 00:15:09.291
So, what's the connection?

270
00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.625
Hulk, they all have the
word "red" in their names.

271
00:15:11.708 --> 00:15:13.083
And they're all marked missing.

272
00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:15.000
Not all of them.

273
00:15:15.083 --> 00:15:16.291
Red She-Hulk?

274
00:15:16.375 --> 00:15:19.125
The only superpowered individual
with "red" in their name

275
00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:20.541
who has not vanished.

276
00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:23.541
Um… I might know
where to find her.

277
00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:26.916
Good. She might be our only
lead to finding my dad.

278
00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:31.184
Can you get out?

279
00:15:31.208 --> 00:15:34.583
No!

280
00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:37.041
What is this? Where are we?

281
00:15:37.125 --> 00:15:40.375
Ah, good. You're awake.

282
00:15:40.458 --> 00:15:43.208
Red Ghost, Red
Guardian, Red Skull.

283
00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:45.875
It's nice to finally
meet you in person.

284
00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.500
And you've met my
robots already.

285
00:15:49.291 --> 00:15:50.291
Huh?

286
00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:53.291
Broken?

287
00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:54.375
Broken?

288
00:15:55.083 --> 00:15:59.666
Bumps you down from
near mint to very fine.

289
00:16:00.166 --> 00:16:02.583
Not worth keeping.

290
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.875
Red Guardian.

291
00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:10.625
Not exactly a spring chicken
anymore, but I like the look of you.

292
00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:12.541
Oh, thank you.

293
00:16:12.625 --> 00:16:15.583
People think it's about
exercise, but, uh…

294
00:16:15.666 --> 00:16:19.291
…it really comes down to
calories in, calories out.

295
00:16:19.375 --> 00:16:23.625
Yes, you are in
magnificent condition.

296
00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:36.166
Stop!

297
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.666
Old West ghost town. Charming.
Didn't know these were still around.

298
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:48.166
All right, guys. When we get to Red
She-Hulk, let me do the talking.

299
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.416
Before today, I did not know
there were other Hulks out there.

300
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.083
Are you close to Red She-Hulk?

301
00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:54.791
She's my ex-girlfriend.

302
00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:57.333
Sorry. She's your ex?

303
00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:58.916
No, no, no. It's fine.

304
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.083
Betty and I ended
things on good terms.

305
00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:04.458
That good, huh?

306
00:17:04.541 --> 00:17:06.791
Uh, looks like you missed
me, Betts.

307
00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:09.333
Maybe next time I won't, Bruce.

308
00:17:09.416 --> 00:17:10.750
What are you doing here?

309
00:17:10.833 --> 00:17:12.791
Well, um, uh...

310
00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:15.235
Well, the thing is...
You look great, by the way.

311
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:17.416
Uh, that... Um, well…

312
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.458
You're starting
to make me angry, Bruce.

313
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:22.041
Spit it out.

314
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:30.500
Whatever. I'm on demo duty for my dad,
so I'm gonna get back to smashing.

315
00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:33.041
I'll go talk to her.

316
00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:35.791
Do you want me to go with you?

317
00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:37.916
- No.
- Ah, that's probably a good idea.

318
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.125
Betty, people with the word "red"
in their name are disappearing.

319
00:17:41.208 --> 00:17:42.458
Possibly being taken.

320
00:17:42.541 --> 00:17:44.000
What's that got to do with me?

321
00:17:44.083 --> 00:17:45.750
Red She-Hulk?

322
00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:47.375
- Red?
- Yeah?

323
00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:50.166
Well, nobody's disappearing me.

324
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.916
My dad is one of
the ones missing.

325
00:17:58.041 --> 00:17:59.166
Red Guardian.

326
00:17:59.666 --> 00:18:02.833
He and I got into this big
argument, and I blew up at him.

327
00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:05.791
I'm going to find
him, but...

328
00:18:05.875 --> 00:18:08.166
Honestly, I'm still
a little mad at him.

329
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.958
Look, it's not always easy
to talk to your old man.

330
00:18:12.041 --> 00:18:13.750
My dad can be a real hothead.

331
00:18:14.291 --> 00:18:16.916
Always trying to boss me
around. Telling me what to do.

332
00:18:17.583 --> 00:18:18.875
No, my dad's different.

333
00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:23.375
He's... He's supportive
and positive and always around.

334
00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:25.750
Then what's the problem?

335
00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:28.958
Problem is he treats
me like a little girl.

336
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.958
I'm not a kid anymore, and I don't
think my dad can accept that.

337
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:34.916
Listen, you're not perfect.
Neither is your dad.

338
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.833
You have to accept
that he's human.

339
00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:38.916
So what if he still
sees you as a kid?

340
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.916
Why does that
bother you so much?

341
00:18:47.916 --> 00:18:49.208
Are these with you?

342
00:18:49.708 --> 00:18:51.458
- No.
- Good.

343
00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.625
Those would be mine.

344
00:18:53.708 --> 00:18:55.666
Sorry they aren't in
the best of shape.

345
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.541
Too scuffed
up to be collectibles.

346
00:18:58.625 --> 00:19:01.458
But they can do my dirty work.

347
00:19:03.791 --> 00:19:06.875
What a magnificent hue.

348
00:19:07.666 --> 00:19:10.291
You're the one
responsible. Who are you?

349
00:19:10.375 --> 00:19:12.125
And what did you do with my dad?

350
00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:18.958
Oh, I'm just an extraordinary fellow who
has it all, and it's still not enough.

351
00:19:19.583 --> 00:19:21.750
I'm the Collector.

352
00:19:22.416 --> 00:19:26.333
As for the other question,
Red Guardian is now part

353
00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:31.750
of the most magnificent
collection in the known universe.

354
00:19:31.833 --> 00:19:33.416
I want him back. Now.

355
00:19:38.666 --> 00:19:40.458
I love the anger.

356
00:19:40.541 --> 00:19:42.291
That is so mint.

357
00:19:42.375 --> 00:19:46.041
Don't damage the red one,
but the rest? Take 'em apart!

358
00:19:56.125 --> 00:19:57.250
All righty then.

359
00:19:57.333 --> 00:19:59.583
I'll crank up the juice
and bring the pain.

360
00:20:03.208 --> 00:20:05.500
Ow.

361
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.666
Keep it busy.

362
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.250
I'm gonna try something.

363
00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:16.833
That all you've got?

364
00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:19.916
I've fought grandmas with
tougher stuff than you.

365
00:20:28.583 --> 00:20:29.583
Hey, Collector!

366
00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:31.958
Nice look. Very alt-rock.

367
00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:35.541
How do you feel about heavy metal?

368
00:20:39.166 --> 00:20:41.791
Always
fashionably late.

369
00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:50.666
I'm gonna smash your ugly
face. Then your ugly face!

370
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.666
And then... Yikes,
there are a lot of you.

371
00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:58.250
Don't worry, Betts!

372
00:20:58.333 --> 00:20:59.916
I got ya...

373
00:21:01.333 --> 00:21:02.791
Typical.

374
00:21:06.208 --> 00:21:07.208
We need a plan.

375
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.833
Thor, call a lightning strike,
aimed at this exact location.

376
00:21:11.916 --> 00:21:13.708
But lightning? Right here?

377
00:21:13.791 --> 00:21:15.541
Won't that vaporize us?

378
00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:17.583
I mean, not me. I'd
obviously be fine.

379
00:21:17.666 --> 00:21:19.166
But the rest of you?

380
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.458
Now, Thor!

381
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.250
Nice.

382
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.500
Wait. They're gone?

383
00:21:38.083 --> 00:21:41.083
And so is my only chance
at finding my dad.

384
00:21:46.583 --> 00:21:48.791
No sign of the Collector
on any of our scanners.

385
00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:51.291
And nothing on the
Wakandan channels as well.

386
00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:52.791
Anyone have any ideas?

387
00:21:52.875 --> 00:21:55.875
To find him, we need
someone with special skills.

388
00:21:56.625 --> 00:21:57.625
A tracker.

389
00:21:57.708 --> 00:21:59.625
Steve and I worked
with him a while back.

390
00:21:59.708 --> 00:22:02.000
Yep. S.H.I.E.L.D. file 268.

391
00:22:02.083 --> 00:22:03.333
He can find anyone.

392
00:22:03.416 --> 00:22:05.500
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no.

393
00:22:05.583 --> 00:22:08.541
No, not that guy.
Anyone but that guy.

394
00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:10.083
He's the best at what he does.

395
00:22:10.166 --> 00:22:12.666
And what he does
isn't very nice.

396
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:19.750
Wolverine.

397
00:22:21.666 --> 00:22:25.125
Guess I'm not
gonna get to eat my lunch.

398
00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:32.166
Stay on this heading.

399
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:36.041
You can track the Collector from
this high up, at this distance?

400
00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:37.875
My nose doesn't lie.

401
00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:42.541
Collector might be untraceable,
but Red She-Hulk leaves a scent.

402
00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:44.958
I can smell a Hulk
from a mile away.

403
00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:46.750
What?

404
00:22:46.833 --> 00:22:50.416
Maybe try smashing a deodorant
factory once in a while.

405
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.041
Take us down
here. This is it.

406
00:23:05.375 --> 00:23:06.375
Over here.

407
00:23:11.583 --> 00:23:13.250
Do you have a lock on my dad?

408
00:23:13.333 --> 00:23:16.041
Picking
up multiple scents.

409
00:23:16.125 --> 00:23:17.333
Red She-Hulk and...

410
00:23:17.416 --> 00:23:19.166
Wait a second...

411
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.000
Red Skull?

412
00:23:21.083 --> 00:23:24.833
The plan is to free everyone
from the Collector. Everyone.

413
00:23:24.916 --> 00:23:27.875
You didn't say anything
about saving villains.

414
00:23:27.958 --> 00:23:32.791
For all I care, the Collector can
keep the Red Ghost and Red Skull and…

415
00:23:34.625 --> 00:23:35.916
Omega Red?

416
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.916
You know him?

417
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.166
Omega Red is the worst.

418
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.625
He just sucks the
life out of you.

419
00:23:42.708 --> 00:23:44.125
Just get us to the Collector.

420
00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:46.041
Follow me.

421
00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:51.333
The place is called Mom's
Diner. That's just adorable.

422
00:23:51.416 --> 00:23:53.250
It's probably a death trap.

423
00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:55.213
Can't be worse than where
you get your hair cut.

424
00:23:56.333 --> 00:23:58.666
Scent ends here.

425
00:24:03.083 --> 00:24:04.083
Spread out.

426
00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:06.166
Look for a hidden door or exit.

427
00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:24.416
Anybody want lemonade?

428
00:24:29.583 --> 00:24:31.583
Collector'll be down there,

429
00:24:31.666 --> 00:24:33.083
in Mom's basement.

430
00:24:37.916 --> 00:24:39.851
Definitely
doesn't look like Earth tech.

431
00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:42.458
Hmm. I don't see any way down.

432
00:24:44.291 --> 00:24:46.750
That's
convenient. And ominous.

433
00:24:49.666 --> 00:24:51.791
My scanners have picked
up a hidden passageway

434
00:24:51.875 --> 00:24:53.875
to a deeper sublevel beneath us.

435
00:24:53.958 --> 00:24:54.958
This way.

436
00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:01.541
I'm coming, Dad.

437
00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:05.375
There better not
be any secret door.

438
00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:07.791
I hate secret doors.

439
00:25:07.875 --> 00:25:09.476
Always where you least expe...

440
00:25:12.333 --> 00:25:14.625
<i>Potential
new collectibles detected.</i>

441
00:25:14.708 --> 00:25:17.541
<i>Activate, clean, scan
and sort functions.</i>

442
00:25:21.083 --> 00:25:23.000
<i>Initializing power wash.</i>

443
00:25:23.708 --> 00:25:25.833
Did that just say power wash?

444
00:25:32.333 --> 00:25:33.458
Whoa.

445
00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:42.541
Wow, this is a
really nice blowout.

446
00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:44.000
Whew! Same.

447
00:25:46.625 --> 00:25:49.500
<i>Scanning
complete. Identify and sort.</i>

448
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.291
<i>Two armored robots with
scratches and surface damage.</i>

449
00:25:53.375 --> 00:25:55.375
- <i>Imperfect.</i>
- Imperfect?

450
00:25:55.458 --> 00:25:56.708
Tony!

451
00:25:56.791 --> 00:25:59.500
<i>Identify
and sort. Four humans.</i>

452
00:25:59.583 --> 00:26:01.250
<i>Identify and sort.</i>

453
00:26:01.333 --> 00:26:02.375
<i>Two animals.</i>

454
00:26:02.458 --> 00:26:04.125
Excuse me?

455
00:26:13.916 --> 00:26:17.541
This entire
room stinks like…

456
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.458
Oh, no.

457
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.583
Is that a…

458
00:26:22.666 --> 00:26:25.500
Wendigo!

459
00:26:35.833 --> 00:26:37.416
Soft.

460
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.458
Like wrestling a big, fluffy pillow.

461
00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:43.000
Uh-oh.

462
00:26:43.083 --> 00:26:44.791
Fluffy pillow's fightin' back.

463
00:26:49.666 --> 00:26:52.458
Hate stupid fluffy pillow!

464
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.333
Okay, bub, you've
taken your best shot.

465
00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:08.958
Now, it's my turn.

466
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.750
Wasn't as
bad as I remembered.

467
00:27:24.833 --> 00:27:26.833
You did pretty good there.

468
00:27:26.916 --> 00:27:29.875
Aw, thanks, man.

469
00:27:29.958 --> 00:27:32.916
I think I
pulled a muscle, but...

470
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.666
More fluffy pillows!

471
00:27:38.166 --> 00:27:39.875
I hate fluffy pillows.

472
00:27:45.416 --> 00:27:47.291
I did not see that coming.

473
00:27:50.458 --> 00:27:51.958
Where's the rest of our team?

474
00:27:52.041 --> 00:27:55.125
- And why did the Collector send us here?
- We were scanned.

475
00:27:55.208 --> 00:27:58.583
The computer said we were
scratched and damaged.

476
00:27:58.666 --> 00:28:00.541
They thought we were scrap.

477
00:28:00.625 --> 00:28:01.916
They underestimated us.

478
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.625
My scanners cannot find an exit.

479
00:28:09.666 --> 00:28:11.625
No exit? Not a problem.

480
00:28:11.708 --> 00:28:13.083
We're gonna build our way out.

481
00:28:15.916 --> 00:28:18.208
What are these things?

482
00:28:18.291 --> 00:28:20.208
Power-inhibiting manacles.

483
00:28:20.291 --> 00:28:21.750
Uh, they jam our powers.

484
00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:24.125
These must be a newer model.

485
00:28:24.958 --> 00:28:27.791
What? Have you never been
captured, thrown in prison

486
00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:30.000
and had your powers
taken away before?

487
00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:31.791
- Nope.
- Nuh-uh.

488
00:28:31.875 --> 00:28:32.958
Can't say that I have.

489
00:28:33.041 --> 00:28:34.708
Just me? Huh.

490
00:28:34.791 --> 00:28:37.416
It's happened to me more
times than I care to...

491
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.458
Really? Like, never?

492
00:28:46.833 --> 00:28:49.666
Well, we found robots,
but not our friends.

493
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.000
Friends?

494
00:28:51.083 --> 00:28:52.916
Who cares about them?

495
00:28:53.708 --> 00:28:56.500
Check out my advanced bots.

496
00:28:56.583 --> 00:28:59.583
You may have bested my
old ones in the desert,

497
00:28:59.666 --> 00:29:02.208
but these are a bit more sturdy.

498
00:29:03.083 --> 00:29:06.916
Oh, the rare treasures
you're about to see.

499
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.875
I don't care about any of this.

500
00:29:08.958 --> 00:29:10.416
I want my dad.

501
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.916
I'll take you to him.

502
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.333
Maybe along the way, you
could learn some manners.

503
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:20.500
This is the magic.

504
00:29:20.583 --> 00:29:23.416
You see, when you get to
be as big a deal as I am,

505
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.541
it's all about
rare, one-of-a-kind,

506
00:29:27.625 --> 00:29:30.958
never made available
to the public before.

507
00:29:31.041 --> 00:29:31.916
Whoa.

508
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.291
Behold, my collection.

509
00:29:37.583 --> 00:29:39.226
The greatest ever,
complete, mint-condition,

510
00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.541
sealed and climate-controlled
acid-free Mylar.

511
00:29:43.083 --> 00:29:45.250
My good stuff is in storage,

512
00:29:45.333 --> 00:29:48.625
but this is the best of what
I've acquired here on Earth.

513
00:29:48.708 --> 00:29:52.041
Oh, you are going
to be impressed by this.

514
00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:57.250
My mythical creatures of legend!

515
00:29:57.333 --> 00:29:58.333
Are they dead?

516
00:29:58.416 --> 00:30:00.625
Of course not.

517
00:30:00.708 --> 00:30:03.208
Suspended animation.

518
00:30:03.291 --> 00:30:08.791
Hibernation stasis, in
absolute mint condition.

519
00:30:11.458 --> 00:30:13.916
You kidnapped Santa Claus?

520
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.083
I knew he was real.

521
00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:17.375
Come on, come on. I have
so much more to show you.

522
00:30:17.458 --> 00:30:19.750
Hey, wait. Don't
you know who that is?

523
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.125
After completing those, I
tried collecting musicians,

524
00:30:23.208 --> 00:30:25.500
but you have no
idea how hard it is

525
00:30:25.583 --> 00:30:27.875
to find rock stars in
halfway-decent condition.

526
00:30:27.958 --> 00:30:29.500
So, I branched out.

527
00:30:29.583 --> 00:30:34.000
Feast your eyes on my
latest and greatest.

528
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.833
My Red Collection!

529
00:30:42.791 --> 00:30:43.791
Dad!

530
00:30:45.875 --> 00:30:46.875
Let go of me!

531
00:30:46.958 --> 00:30:49.583
The first color of the rainbow.

532
00:30:49.666 --> 00:30:51.416
Soon to be followed by others.

533
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.041
Although, it thins out
between green and purple.

534
00:30:54.541 --> 00:30:56.041
Not sure why.

535
00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:58.208
Collector, you're
completely mad.

536
00:30:58.291 --> 00:31:02.666
I'm super mad at you
ungrateful casuals.

537
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:06.541
You don't appreciate the
greatness in my collection.

538
00:31:07.375 --> 00:31:11.125
That's why I've
decided to collect you.

539
00:31:14.166 --> 00:31:15.583
Relax.

540
00:31:15.666 --> 00:31:18.041
You'll be in a protective slab.

541
00:31:18.125 --> 00:31:20.125
Frozen in stasis.

542
00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:24.041
Perfect forever.

543
00:31:26.583 --> 00:31:29.000
Sam, can you fly out?

544
00:31:29.083 --> 00:31:32.416
No can do! These inhibitors
have everything shut down.

545
00:31:33.583 --> 00:31:36.250
Huh?

546
00:31:39.083 --> 00:31:41.541
You'll be part of my
latest collection.

547
00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:43.750
My Avengers Collection.

548
00:31:46.125 --> 00:31:47.125
Dad.

549
00:31:47.541 --> 00:31:50.125
What about Red Guardian? Where
are you going to put him?

550
00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:52.708
He's already in
my Red Collection.

551
00:31:52.791 --> 00:31:54.833
Then your collection's
incomplete.

552
00:31:54.916 --> 00:31:56.708
If Red Guardian's with the Reds,

553
00:31:56.791 --> 00:31:59.583
then your Avengers Collection
will always have a hole in it.

554
00:31:59.666 --> 00:32:01.833
What? What are
you talking about?

555
00:32:01.916 --> 00:32:03.916
Red Guardian is red.

556
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.416
Red Guardian is an Avenger.

557
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.083
- No, he can't be...
- You...

558
00:32:09.166 --> 00:32:10.958
But he just... Fine, whatever.

559
00:32:11.041 --> 00:32:13.625
- I'll just put him in both sets.
- Well, you can't do that.

560
00:32:13.708 --> 00:32:15.791
He's either in one
collection or the other,

561
00:32:15.875 --> 00:32:18.625
but one of them will
never be complete.

562
00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:21.291
No! I have to file
him under something!

563
00:32:21.375 --> 00:32:25.875
Do you have any idea how many spreadsheets
I have to keep track of all this?

564
00:32:29.708 --> 00:32:31.458
Wait, that's not the machine.

565
00:32:34.625 --> 00:32:36.333
Nobody puts us in the trash.

566
00:32:37.958 --> 00:32:40.583
At worst, we belong in recycling.

567
00:32:42.416 --> 00:32:43.833
Told you they were here.

568
00:32:43.916 --> 00:32:45.916
The nose never lies.

569
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.875
What happened?

570
00:32:47.958 --> 00:32:51.208
I don't wanna talk
about it.

571
00:32:59.875 --> 00:33:02.458
I think it's time to
collect a little payback.

572
00:33:03.875 --> 00:33:06.500
Strike!

573
00:33:26.208 --> 00:33:27.416
Do your thing, Wolverine.

574
00:33:30.166 --> 00:33:32.458
Where are we?

575
00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:35.708
Okay, you're inside the lair of
an alien who... No, you know what?

576
00:33:35.791 --> 00:33:38.791
Someone will explain later. Right
now, we just need you to smash.

577
00:33:38.875 --> 00:33:39.875
I can manage that.

578
00:33:41.125 --> 00:33:43.250
Oh, and Santa is real!

579
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.583
Santa's real, everybody.

580
00:33:48.125 --> 00:33:49.416
Dad.

581
00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:08.875
Uh-oh.

582
00:34:16.166 --> 00:34:17.916
And that's how it's done.

583
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.125
You miss me, Betts?

584
00:34:19.208 --> 00:34:22.000
Maybe. Just a little.

585
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.625
Rescuing you feels wrong.

586
00:34:27.708 --> 00:34:29.666
Omega Red?

587
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.041
Forget it.

588
00:34:32.125 --> 00:34:35.250
You're gonna try to convince me
this is the right thing to do.

589
00:34:35.333 --> 00:34:37.666
I don't have to.
You already know it.

590
00:34:41.916 --> 00:34:45.625
My greatest foe!

591
00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:47.708
I knew you'd come!

592
00:34:50.291 --> 00:34:54.291
Wait till I tell Sabretooth,
Deathstrike and Cyber, huh?

593
00:34:54.375 --> 00:34:56.375
They're never going
to believe it.

594
00:34:56.458 --> 00:35:00.333
Old Wolvie has a heart
after all, am I right?

595
00:35:00.416 --> 00:35:04.125
We should take a
picture to commemorate this.

596
00:35:04.208 --> 00:35:06.583
Hey, does anyone have
a phone we can borrow

597
00:35:06.666 --> 00:35:08.666
and maybe, like, a selfie stick?

598
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.750
You are so exhausting.

599
00:35:11.833 --> 00:35:15.208
My collection!

600
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:17.166
My life's work!

601
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.916
They're... They're opening it!

602
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.250
Wish I had time
to do an unboxing video,

603
00:35:23.333 --> 00:35:26.708
but I need to stop them
before they ruin everything!

604
00:35:32.458 --> 00:35:33.458
There.

605
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.125
Hold on, Dad.

606
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:50.500
Whoa.

607
00:35:50.583 --> 00:35:53.625
Natasha, you managed to save me?

608
00:35:53.708 --> 00:35:55.291
Dad, I...

609
00:35:55.375 --> 00:35:56.375
What is it?

610
00:36:00.083 --> 00:36:02.375
Dad!

611
00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:08.791
Drop me. I'm too heavy.

612
00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:11.083
No! I can rescue you.

613
00:36:11.166 --> 00:36:14.250
Why... Why
won't you trust me?

614
00:36:14.333 --> 00:36:16.375
Of course I trust you.

615
00:36:16.458 --> 00:36:20.208
But I'm your papa. It's
my job to protect you.

616
00:36:20.291 --> 00:36:22.291
And I'm scared for you.

617
00:36:22.375 --> 00:36:23.583
I'm scared too.

618
00:36:24.083 --> 00:36:27.166
Papa, I think you liked me
better when I was little,

619
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.791
but I'm not a kid anymore.

620
00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:31.833
And I'm scared you don't
love me for who I am now.

621
00:36:31.916 --> 00:36:35.125
Natasha, I could
never stop loving you.

622
00:36:35.208 --> 00:36:39.000
I know I hover around like a
helicopter, but I can't help it.

623
00:36:39.083 --> 00:36:43.166
You're so grown up, and
you don't need me anymore.

624
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:45.916
I don't know how else
to spend time with you.

625
00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:52.250
It was so much simpler then.

626
00:36:52.875 --> 00:36:54.708
Remember when you were little?

627
00:36:55.208 --> 00:36:58.166
You and I used
to make pancakes together.

628
00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:59.625
We still can.

629
00:36:59.708 --> 00:37:02.458
But, Papa, you need to let go.

630
00:37:02.541 --> 00:37:04.083
You want me to let go?

631
00:37:04.166 --> 00:37:05.583
No! No, no.

632
00:37:05.666 --> 00:37:08.750
You have to let go of the
idea that I'm a little girl.

633
00:37:12.958 --> 00:37:14.375
Coming through!

634
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.833
Goodness, you're so strong now.

635
00:37:22.458 --> 00:37:25.500
My Natasha.

636
00:37:28.916 --> 00:37:31.083
Must be something
else I can use.

637
00:37:31.166 --> 00:37:32.375
Something that'll...

638
00:37:32.458 --> 00:37:34.208
Oh, this will do.

639
00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:46.291
Is this the right way?

640
00:37:51.291 --> 00:37:52.291
Heads up!

641
00:37:58.958 --> 00:38:00.083
What the...

642
00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.250
Get down!

643
00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:14.541
Game on.

644
00:38:22.625 --> 00:38:25.333
Ho ho ho!

645
00:38:25.416 --> 00:38:26.916
Hi-yah!

646
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.833
Did you like the
milk and cookies, Santa?

647
00:38:32.916 --> 00:38:35.500
Of course, I did, Steven.

648
00:38:35.583 --> 00:38:37.875
You've always been a good boy.

649
00:38:38.375 --> 00:38:39.708
Now, come along.

650
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:43.041
Time to kick some
butt, North Pole style.

651
00:38:43.125 --> 00:38:44.833
For the elves!

652
00:38:44.916 --> 00:38:47.791
Santa! No!

653
00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:52.625
Ho! Nice try, dragon!

654
00:38:52.708 --> 00:38:54.416
But you've met your match.

655
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.166
If I tamed Rudolph,
I can tame you!

656
00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:02.958
Ho ho!

657
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.250
Do you want to
finish this together?

658
00:39:11.333 --> 00:39:12.583
Are you sure?

659
00:39:12.666 --> 00:39:14.416
I'm not intruding?

660
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:15.958
You're not intruding, Papa.

661
00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:18.291
Like I told the Collector,
you're an Avenger.

662
00:39:22.625 --> 00:39:24.708
Yeah!

663
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:29.375
Flip it, flatten it,
just like making pancakes!

664
00:39:29.458 --> 00:39:31.500
Oh, you're doing great, Natasha!

665
00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:33.458
You make me proud!

666
00:39:34.333 --> 00:39:36.208
Get away from there!

667
00:39:37.416 --> 00:39:38.458
Let him go!

668
00:39:40.833 --> 00:39:46.583
That machine is more
important than life itself.

669
00:39:46.666 --> 00:39:48.791
All it does is lock people up.

670
00:39:48.875 --> 00:39:51.291
No! It protects them!

671
00:39:51.375 --> 00:39:52.916
Can't you see?

672
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.833
If we don't keep things in
mint condition, they change.

673
00:39:56.916 --> 00:39:59.791
But locked in a bubble,
they won't change!

674
00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:01.916
They stay perfect!

675
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.458
Stay perfect?

676
00:40:06.166 --> 00:40:08.583
So what if it changes?

677
00:40:08.666 --> 00:40:10.375
Still perfect.

678
00:40:13.083 --> 00:40:14.583
No, no, no!

679
00:40:18.708 --> 00:40:19.708
My stuff!

680
00:40:22.208 --> 00:40:24.958
I hate this place!

681
00:40:25.041 --> 00:40:27.000
I hate this planet!

682
00:40:27.083 --> 00:40:29.291
I hate everything!

683
00:40:30.125 --> 00:40:32.958
Computer, we're leaving!

684
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:41.541
I have
to get out of here!

685
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:45.291
Huh?

686
00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:54.750
Am I dizzy, or is
the room moving?

687
00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:57.958
Worse than that. It's rising.
We need to get out of here.

688
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.291
Panther and I have it.

689
00:41:05.125 --> 00:41:06.708
Hit the eject... Now!

690
00:41:12.583 --> 00:41:14.291
Path is clear!

691
00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:15.625
Everybody, out!

692
00:41:42.208 --> 00:41:44.041
Whoa! You can't touch this.

693
00:41:53.833 --> 00:41:55.416
All the
bad guys secured.

694
00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.666
You did the right
thing by saving them.

695
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.166
And you made a new friend.

696
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.666
Yoo-hoo! Wolvie!

697
00:42:15.958 --> 00:42:18.041
Yeah.

698
00:42:19.125 --> 00:42:21.958
Actually, this was, uh, Jarvis's recipe.

699
00:42:22.583 --> 00:42:23.583
More, please.

700
00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:25.416
Whoa, you got chocolate
chips in this?

701
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.250
- They're amazing.
- What is your recipe?

702
00:42:27.333 --> 00:42:29.583
These are the best pancakes
we've ever made, Dad.

703
00:42:34.083 --> 00:42:37.750
Have some more! There is
plenty for all.

704
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.416
It's mine! I don't wanna share!

705
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.166
No. I'm not done with it yet.

706
00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.041
You're the worst!

707
00:42:49.125 --> 00:42:51.416
No, you're the worst!

708
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.250
Santa!

709
00:42:53.333 --> 00:42:54.875
It's Santa Cl...

710
00:42:54.958 --> 00:42:58.458
Fighting over toys will get
you on the naughty list!

711
00:42:58.541 --> 00:43:01.625
Ho ho ho!
