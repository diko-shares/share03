Thank you.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.600
Hey!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.400
Hey, you're holding people up here!

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.400
How you doing today?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.900
Not so good.

Roll. You know that's it, come on.

You be careful today,

20
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.500
Anybody selling

How you doing, ma'am?

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.800
I like that oriental
jacket you got on.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.000
That's $20 each, ma'am.

27
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.300
Two for $20!
No, no, you got...

28
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.400
That's $20 right

You got to give me
another $20.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.500
Ma'am, you got two
of them right there.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.200
How you doing,
young lady?

32
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.900
How much is this
Harry Potter book?

33
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.900
$20. Kids love them things,
that Harry Potter stuff.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.300
You got kids,
they gonna love that.

35
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.600
Yo, move your shit, man.

IPods, $20!

37
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.300
Move your shit, man.
How much is your book?

38
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.500
I'm just trying to
make some money, man.

39
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.300
Harry Potter Versus
the Hipopotamus?

40
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.500
This is misspelled.

41
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.800
No, that's how
you spell it.

42
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.000
Where do you
put the tape?

43
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.200
No, it's not a Walkman,
it's an iPod, sir.

44
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.400
Move all this shit, man.
Move all this shit.

45
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.500
Excuse me, can I have
my money back?

46
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.200
I want my money back.

47
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.200
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?

48
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.100
Get off me!
Get off me!

49
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.400
Come on, stop!

50
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.300
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

51
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.400
Drop this, man!

52
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.300
Get off me, I said!

53
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.400
Don't run, bitch!

54
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.900
Watch yourself!

55
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.300
Get off me, man!

56
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.100
Look, I'm sorry. I'm
not trying anything.

57
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.600
Grab that.
Grab that. Grab that.

58
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.200
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Come here.

59
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.400
Hey, what are you doing?
Just watch yourself.

60
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.500
Give me
back my money!

61
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.400
Somebody ought
to call the cops on you.

62
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.500
Walk this way, walk.

63
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.000
Pay your fare!

64
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.600
Hey, Mr. Sou.

65
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.500
How you doing, Mr. Sou?

66
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.600
Good? You know that
Radio Music Hall up there?

67
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.800
Man, I'll tell you, they
tried to kill me up there, man.

68
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.500
I bought some stuff
from downtown.

69
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.500
It was a fake book. I don't
even know how you do a fake book.

70
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.900
I'm gonna get some umbrellas
from you, is that okay?

71
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.900
Can I get some umbrellas from you? Yeah?

72
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.000
You said $100
last time, right?

73
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.200
I got in a fight, lost all my
money. This is all I got left.

74
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.600
Is that okay?

75
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.300
That's $100 right there. I
got one $20 left, all right?

76
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.300
Man, I had my stuff at
Radio City Music Hall.

77
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.700
I ain't gonna go down
there no more, though.

78
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.900
They're a bunch of crooks down
there. I'll see you later, Mr. Sou.

79
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.300
It's that kid from before,
Harvey. He's coming in here.

80
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.800
Can I help you?

81
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.100
Come on, look, I want
my money back, okay?

82
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.400
What money are you
talking about?

83
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.600
You know what I'm talking
about. Look, I don't mean no...

84
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.900
Come on.
He took it.

85
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.500
No, he did not... Okay,
I want it back right now.

86
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.100
He took your money? Okay.
Same shirt and everything.

87
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.800
This is Z and
as you can tell,

88
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.400
he's a little retarded
sometimes, okay?

89
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.100
Harvey.
Look, listen.

90
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.200
How much are we talking about
here? Don't give him shit.

91
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.800
No, no, listen. I've
got this. How much...

92
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.500
Hey, that's not nice.
That's not nice.

93
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.000
Here, thank you very much.

94
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.300
I should call the police on
you, you know? You should.

95
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.300
That's exactly what you should do.
I'll wait here for you if you want.

96
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.900
You know, you shouldn't be
robbing people, you know that?

97
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.300
And especially ones that
can come and find you.

98
00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.300
Why don't you sit down and
talk to me for a second?

99
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.400
I just want to have
a conversation with you.

100
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.800
I was talking
about you earlier.

101
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.300
Look, try some of these bread
things, they're terrible.

102
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400
You're going to
go after this kid?

103
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.600
Hey, wait up a second.
Where you going?

104
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.400
You know, that was some show
you put on out there today.

105
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.800
In the streets, you
know, the fisticuff thing.

106
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.800
Can I ask you one
question, though?

107
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.700
I'd much rather you
just stop following me.

108
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.500
I'm not following you, I'm
walking down the street.

109
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.800
But look, if you
want to make money...

110
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.100
You know...

111
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.300
Sorry, buddy.

112
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.000
There ain't
no friends here.

113
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.600
Think sitting behind a desk,
sucking ass all day, is making money.

114
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.500
Look, I'm Harvey Boarden,
all right?

115
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.400
Let me introduce myself,
I'm Harvey Boarden.

116
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.100
Shawn MacArthur.

117
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.900
Good to meet you.
You like to fight?

118
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.500
If I have to.

119
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.200
I can make you $5,000.

120
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.200
Got you interested, huh?

121
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.900
You see that store
right there?

122
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.800
You ever wonder how little
places like that stay in business?

123
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.100
BMW parked in front of it.
People dressed nicely.

124
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.100
They like people
that like to fight.

125
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.100
You want to make
some money at it?

126
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.500
Huh?

127
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.000
Yes or no?

128
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.600
You don't want to make no
money, you don't have to go.

129
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.100
You can go on
with your life.

130
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.300
I can make $5,000 with
you on one fight alone.

131
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.900
You can stay there
and go home if you like

132
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
or you can come
and get $5,000.

133
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.200
Wait, hey.

134
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.200
You ain't got no place to
go, go where you're going.

135
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.300
You better give me $5,000
if I walk across the street.

136
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.800
Come on, break out
one of them umbrellas.

137
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.100
It ain't raining.

138
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.400
You're right.

139
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.600
You know these guys, you
ever seen these guys before?

140
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.000
I'm like an agent for them,
I get them talent and stuff.

141
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.800
Hey, Christopher,
Jack.

142
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.300
Hey, Harvey.

143
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.700
Hey, Claudette, Martinez.

144
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.500
Chinese guy
named Martinez.

145
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.700
What?

146
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.200
Go figure.

147
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.300
That guy was Chinese?

148
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.000
Yeah, his mother
or something.

149
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.100
But those guys, they run every
bet place in this whole city.

150
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.900
And that's what matters
'cause that's how you get paid.

151
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.600
Hey, Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson.

152
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.100
Harvey, I have to thank you so
much for those Billy Joel tickets.

153
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.000
I'm so glad you enjoyed it.
You look lovely tonight, ma'am.

154
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.700
Did he do my favorite song,
the "Downtown Alexa" thing?

155
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.800
Okay. Hey!

156
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.400
What are you doing,
Harvey? No way.

157
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.200
No way. I gotta go to 38th
Street to get some juice.

158
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.700
It's about to rain.

159
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.400
Get in the car, drive.
Get in the car, Z.

160
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.900
I got an umbrella for you
anyway. Come on, get in.

161
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.600
Get rid of the box, you
don't need that anymore.

162
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.500
Where are we going?

163
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.400
We're in a $100,000 Mercedes.
That's where we're going.

164
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.500
Okay, so what
happened to the $5,000?

165
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.400
Hey, here's your boy.

166
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.500
Good morning.

167
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.700
Thanks for showing.

168
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.500
I got your text,
so here I am.

169
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.800
You need a soda or anything?

170
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.300
No, I'm cool.

171
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.700
Do me a favor. Go get me
a orange soda or something.

172
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.600
So what goes on here?

173
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.500
Well, we're going to get you an
opportunity. You want to fight, right?

174
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.300
I want to make money.

175
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.600
Okay, first thing, we got
to make you presentable.

176
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.600
Put this on. I don't
want to wear your jacket.

177
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.900
Presentation is everything. Come on.

178
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
It's about making money. I'm
going to give you an opportunity.

179
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.900
Real nice smile.

180
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.700
This thing
don't even fit me.

181
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.900
Where's my change?

182
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.200
It was $3.

183
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.900
You know, I can get that
for $1 across the street.

184
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.800
Yeah, and you could have gotten
it for 50 cents at the supermarket.

185
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.600
Comedians.

186
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.600
Come on.
I don't...

187
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.900
We're going to
make some money?

188
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.300
Yeah.

189
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.800
I feel stupid.

190
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.100
If they invite you over,
tell them you can fight,

191
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.400
'cause you can,
you know?

192
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.400
Better yet, don't even say nothing
to them, let me do the talking

193
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.900
and I'll take care
of everything.

194
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.100
Yo, Harvey,
you want a stove?

195
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.200
Hey, Christopher, you guys are
still doing the fight stuff, right?

196
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.900
I've got a guy right here.
Hey, Z, bring him over here!

197
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.700
This kid right here is
an incredible fighter.

198
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.800
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, yeah?

199
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.200
Jack. Jack.

200
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.600
Tell me, when was the last
time that you had a white guy

201
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.300
that looked like this
in one of your fights?

202
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.200
And you did college
and everything, right?

203
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.300
You went to college?

204
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.100
That is remarkable.

205
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.400
He's the real thing.

206
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.300
A white kid who went to
college, that's amazing.

207
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.000
How come I never
heard of you?

208
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.100
Well, he's from...

209
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.200
No offense, but I've
never heard of you either.

210
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.000
Look, I'm sorry, you know,
sometimes he's a wiseass.

211
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.400
But he's...
I'm not joking here.

212
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.900
I'll give him a peep.

213
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.500
Yeah,
I'll give him a peep.

214
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.500
White boy who
went to college.

215
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.400
Thanks, Jack.

216
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.300
Can I get my jacket back, please?

217
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.600
Why'd you go
talking to him?

218
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.100
He asked me a question.

219
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.300
You got to let me do the talking
from now on, okay? Please.

220
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.900
Okay.
Please.

221
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.300
You know, I'll beep you
if he calls me. Come on.

222
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.400
Beep me?

223
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.800
Well, I'll page you,
text you, whatever.

224
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.000
Where are y'all going?

225
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.100
What, you lonely,
you need a friend?

226
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.700
We got things to do.
We'll text you.

227
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.400
Now there's these junk stores and
these vendors and these big signs and

228
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.000
overhead construction
cranes and all this...

229
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.000
Lady! What are you
yelling about?

230
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.500
You know, they used to
sell drugs in that building.

231
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.000
Well, that's okay,
but now they've got

232
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.800
men riding elevators
to wash the windows...

233
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.400
Well, let them...
Move on, it's okay.

234
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.400
And you take your life in your
hands just crossing the street,

235
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.100
there's so much demolition
stuff all around. Look at it...

236
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.100
After you.

237
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.000
Hey, Giovanni, you got
a refrigerator in there?

238
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.500
Last one, baby,
get it while it's hot.

239
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.500
Baby, come and get one,
buy one, get one free.

240
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.700
Come on over.

241
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.700
They had money on you
not making it.

242
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.800
So this thing's
for real?

243
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.000
Yes, it's very real.
Very real.

244
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.100
$5,000?

245
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.800
Yes, but minus costs.

246
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.600
Hey, be careful with
those shoes there.

247
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.800
Minus what?

248
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.100
Costs. This is Alexander.

249
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.000
Ray, Alexander.
Ray, Shawn.

250
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.100
You roughed them up
the other day,

251
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.400
so they're gonna ride
in the front and drive

252
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.700
and you're going to be
in the back with me.

253
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.400
No, no, I'm driving,
this is my car.

254
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.600
And it's
a very nice car.

255
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.300
You know, if your boy
wants to go, we can go.

256
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.000
Wait a second.
Come on, man, look,

257
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.200
I wasn't interested in no trouble
with you, so you need to relax, okay?

258
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.700
Where's this
hostility coming from?

259
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.700
Text me again, and I swear
to God I'm gonna hurt you.

260
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.700
He keeps sending me these
stupid little things, you know.

261
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.000
Just costing me money.
Come on, Harvey.

262
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.700
Why am I sitting in the
car and it ain't moving?

263
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.100
Come on, these little texts
that you keep sending me

264
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.800
are costing me $1 a minute.

265
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.600
So, what, I'm going to fight
this guy, then what happens?

266
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.900
Well, we go in,
you win, you get $5,000.

267
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.300
You lose, you get nothing.

268
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.500
So we get
paid tonight?

269
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.700
Yes,
we will get paid.

270
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.500
You keep asking me
the same question.

271
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.700
All right, Harvey.

272
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.500
So what, they got rules or something?

273
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.000
They don't like scared,
okay. There's the church.

274
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.600
Yeah, if you kick him
in the nuts, you win.

275
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.700
Right.
There's Sydney up there.

276
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.400
Gouge the eyes,
everything.

277
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.800
Come on. Come on, Z.

278
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.200
This is Brooklyn, huh?

279
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.200
Yeah,
as you can see.

280
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.800
Hey, there, Sydney.
How you doing?

281
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're late.

282
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.700
We have to have this place cleaned
up by the morning, so hurry up.

283
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.900
Okay.

284
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.600
Excuse me.

285
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.300
Here you go, do what you got to do.

286
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.200
Excuse me.

287
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.000
Scratch, bite.

288
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.100
Thank you.

289
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.900
Yo, smells like farts and
ass in here, you smell that?

290
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.500
Smell like pure vodka.

291
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.900
The place is a
playground, but, like, bad.

292
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.200
Filled with bad people.

293
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.600
Fighter.

294
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.800
You ready?

295
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.800
Go make some money.

296
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.100
Hey, Jack.

297
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.400
Harvey, you running on
Caucasian people time, huh?

298
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.700
I'm running. I'm running.

299
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.300
You're running?
Yeah.

300
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.300
Yeah,
you keep running.

301
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.300
Na zdorovie, brother.

302
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.000
Let's see what
you got, Shawn!

303
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.700
Let's see it, Shawn!

304
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.500
Go, go, go, go!

305
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.700
Ow!

306
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.700
Yeah.

307
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.800
Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

308
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.200
Hey, come here.
It's over, it's over.

309
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.000
Come on, have a seat.
Don't smile at nobody.

310
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.500
Just sit down.
Watch yourselves.

311
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.900
You got some tissue in your
pocket? Anybody got tissue?

312
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.800
Give him some tissue.

313
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.500
He can fight, right?

314
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.600
On the water fountain.

315
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.200
Told you
he could fight.

316
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.500
So you both should come to the
club. He's going to need a jacket.

317
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.400
I got to get out of here.
Give him your jacket.

318
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.400
I can't stand Brooklyn.

319
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.300
You tell Jack I know
what I'm doing.

320
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.600
Yeah.

321
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.800
No, we're special guests of Mr. Dancing.

322
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.000
Could you just
see for me?

323
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.800
I'm telling you,
we're on the list.

324
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.900
Will you let Renee know
I'm on the list, please?

325
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.500
Let them through.
Two of you.

326
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.400
Now, come on, Harvey.
Harvey!

327
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.300
I feel like a bum.

328
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.400
No, you look great.

329
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.400
Cordell!
Cordell, Harvey Boarden.

330
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.000
We're VIP.
We're VIP. Hi.

331
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.200
We got VIP.

332
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.700
That's reserved for us. Right
here. They ain't gonna tell us.

333
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.900
Try to ink out. Come here, have a drink.

334
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.800
You gonna introduce me to your friend?

335
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.300
Shawn, this is
Shevonne Dubai.

336
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.300
Am I pronouncing
that right?

337
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.500
Mmm-hmm.

338
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.600
Have a seat.
Have a seat.

339
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.200
Yo, yo, yo!

340
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.900
Come here,
where you going?

341
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.500
Yo, man. I heard you were great
out there in Brooklyn today, man!

342
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.300
He's a winner,
he's a real winner.

343
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.000
Yeah, look, I meant
to say hi to you

344
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.700
the other day on the
street, but with Harvey,

345
00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.800
you never know when anybody's
anybody, you know what I'm saying?

346
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.200
Yeah, I think
I saw you out there.

347
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.200
Yeah, yeah, you guys are just coming
from dinner, right, something like that?

348
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.700
Right?
No.

349
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.100
Yeah, listen, man, you ever want
to dine, I'll take you to a place

350
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.000
where you don't have to sit at a
counter, you know what I'm saying?

351
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.100
Shawn, right?

352
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.400
Yeah, that's his name.
Listen.

353
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.800
It seems we're going to be
working together, okay?

354
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,
I heard he'd already lined up

355
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.600
to fight big boy
over there.

356
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.100
Yeah, yeah, well, I was
talking to him about that.

357
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.400
What is this, Harvey,
$10,000?

358
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.400
Since when are you into
this kind of stakes?

359
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.700
Can he just rest for a
minute? He just had a fight.

360
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.900
You want some water?

361
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.900
Yeah, yeah.

362
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Can I get you some
water? Poor Harvey, man.

363
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.200
Let me ask you something.

364
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.200
You think you could beat
big boy over there?

365
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.200
Do we think
he can win?

366
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.900
MARTINEZ: Harvey,
I wasn't asking you.

367
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I was asking your friend here in
the nice blazer, with the blonde.

368
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.600
Can I do that?

369
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.600
Can you all pardon
me for a second?

370
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

371
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.800
Hey, Harvey, you're gonna
lose that real quick. Watch.

372
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.700
Excuse me,
Harry Potter book.

373
00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.900
You got to be kidding.

374
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.500
Okay.

375
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.800
I knew I was going
to see you again.

376
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.400
Look, I feel bad
about that book.

377
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.900
Look, you remember me?

378
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
You remember me,
don't you?

379
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.400
I remember you.
We spoke, you...

380
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.100
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah?

381
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.900
Hey, look, I just wanted to
take you to dinner or something.

382
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.700
I'm good, thank you.

383
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.900
No, I was thinking
maybe sometime

384
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.900
something without
a counter. That's all.

385
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.400
That's good. I like that,
without a counter.

386
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.000
I just heard somebody
say that upstairs.

387
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.800
You heard somebody
say that. Okay.

388
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.300
No, look, I just feel
bad about the book,

389
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.000
kind of want to, I don't
know, make it up to you. Hey.

390
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Hey. Thank you. Looking
beautiful as usual.

391
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.500
I'm Shawn.

392
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.400
Zulay.
Zulay.

393
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.900
That's pretty.
Thank you.

394
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.200
I believe in fate, so...

395
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.400
I don't.
Oh, no.

396
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.500
What do you think?

397
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.200
If I see you again,
then we'll call it fate.

398
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.500
Okay. One more time.
Okay.

399
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.900
Goodbye.

400
00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.300
Counting on it. All right.

401
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.500
Okay.

402
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.900
Zulay.

403
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.400
Bunch of losers
in here, man!

404
00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.700
Someone tell that idiot the
whole place is filled with losers.

405
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.300
Right, Harvey?

406
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.200
Hey, so we got
another fight, huh?

407
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.400
Yeah, we are, but we're gonna
talk about it in a second.

408
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.500
I'm going to meet you
over there.

409
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.200
So what did you say,
$10,000, right?

410
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.100
$10,000, that's like
a hundred $100s.

411
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.400
There he is.

412
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.600
Shawn, this is Jerry.
Jerry.

413
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.400
Nice to meet you.
This is Jim.

414
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.300
And that's Joel right there,
and these are their dates.

415
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.600
Look, I'm going to
meet you over there

416
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.800
and we're going to
talk about everything.

417
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.000
Shawn.

418
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.800
You know, we lost a lot of money
betting on your ass to get beat tonight.

419
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.200
Well, maybe you'll bet
the right way next time.

420
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.700
And what's the
right way to bet?

421
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.500
'Cause, you know, I wipe
my ass with a hundred $100s.

422
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.100
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, hey. Just have a seat.

423
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.800
I'll be over
there in a second.

424
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.500
Come on, Jerry.

425
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.200
Excuse me,
we're sitting here.

426
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.300
You're Evan Hailey,
right?

427
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.800
Yeah, and you're
wearing contacts.

428
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.100
Holy shit.
Shawn MacArthur.

429
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.900
I'm sorry,
man, is this your girl?

430
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.100
No. Uh-uh.

431
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.200
So what brings you
to New York, man?

432
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.000
Well, just...

433
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.800
Martinez.
How you doing, man?

434
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.400
Hi, bud, I know who you are. But
you have to excuse me for a second,

435
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.300
I'm just... I'm bugging
out a little bit right now.

436
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.600
You all two
know each other?

437
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.600
I know who you are.

438
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.200
Yeah. Yeah,
we know each other.

439
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.000
I used to wrestle for Shawn's
father back in Birmingham, Alabama.

440
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.500
So how is your father?
Yeah? I'm sure he's fine.

441
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.700
Mmm-hmm.

442
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.700
You know, I'm going to let you
all have a good night, okay?

443
00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.800
I'm gonna go ahead
and get out of here.

444
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.000
Hey, come on, man.

445
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.900
Relax, man,
come on, sit down.

446
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.400
Hey. Don't touch me.

447
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.100
"Don't touch."
You know what...

448
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.300
You worried about your jacket?
Huh? That's the problem?

449
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.400
I'll buy you a new one,
how's that?

450
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.500
I don't need your jacket. No?

451
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.300
Hey, is everything
okay over here?

452
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.400
Harvey.

453
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.100
These two guys are
old friends, man.

454
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.000
Evan just was offering
to buy him a new jacket.

455
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.600
I said I didn't
need a jacket.

456
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.700
Come on, Shawn, look.

457
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.100
You guys.
I'm Harvey Boarden.

458
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.700
Harvey Boarden,
go wash my car, man.

459
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.300
You know, somebody
might hurt you

460
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.800
for doing something
like that.

461
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.100
That somebody
going to be you?

462
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.400
Come on, let's go.

463
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.600
MARTINEZ:
You should go, Harvey.

464
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.200
You're bad, man.

465
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.400
Yeah, Harvey,
you can go now.

466
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.300
Neolithic-looking idiot.
Always saying my damn name.

467
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.400
My daddy used to tell me, "Nothing
good happens after 10:00 p. M."

468
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.000
It's got to be damn
near 2:00 now.

469
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.500
Right?
Yeah.

470
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.700
You knew that guy, huh?

471
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.600
Yeah, he used to wrestle
for my dad's team.

472
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.700
Really?

473
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.600
You know,
I'm gonna go, okay?

474
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.400
Well, where you going?

475
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.600
What, you need
a friend now?

476
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.600
What?

477
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.900
I'm just gonna
go for a walk.

478
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.000
Okay.

479
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.800
Good night, Zulay.
Good night, Zulay.

480
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.500
Good night.

481
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.400
Zulay. Like July?

482
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.100
Yeah, that's right.
I say that right?

483
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.300
You did.

484
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.600
I figured I'd take fate
into my own hands, you know.

485
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.300
And you did.
I have to go. I...

486
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.700
Nice seeing you, Shawn.

487
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.200
Oh, you called me
Shawn. That's cool.

488
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.300
Hey, you make sure
she gets home okay.

489
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.300
Okay. Thank you.

490
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.800
All right?

491
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800
Thank you, Shawn.

492
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.800
Uh-oh! Don't use it again.

493
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.800
My name. That's good.
Good night.

494
00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.600
Hey, King Arthur,
it's Merlin.

495
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.200
Hey, man.

496
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.200
What you doing here?

497
00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.500
That's what I was
gonna ask you.

498
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.100
What time is it?

499
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.500
You fell asleep
on the bench.

500
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.400
You look like a crackhead.

501
00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.400
I just sat down
for a second. And...

502
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.200
Wow.

503
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.400
I can't believe you just
saw me sleeping on the...

504
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.900
I just sat down,
just for a minute

505
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.200
and I don't know, I just
kind of went to sleep.

506
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.100
I can't believe it.

507
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.100
I've got an extra room at
my place. You can stay there.

508
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.300
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, I'm okay.

509
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.900
If you like.
No, you're not okay.

510
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.600
I was just about to
go to a hotel, man.

511
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.200
Yeah, 7:00 in
the morning.

512
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.100
They don't even check
you in until 1:00.

513
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.600
You don't have to
stay at a hotel,

514
00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.600
I've got a place
right around the corner.

515
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.200
But you can stay there
until you find another place.

516
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.500
All right, look,
I'm gonna pay you.

517
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.500
Yeah, you're going to
pay me back for sure.

518
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.400
Come on,
grab your stuff.

519
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.500
If somebody saw you sleeping out
here, you know what they'd think?

520
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.900
We wouldn't make
no more money.

521
00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.000
Nothing's free
in this world.

522
00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.900
I just was there
for a minute or two.

523
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.500
Well, you're in deep
with Harvey Boarden now.

524
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.200
So we're going
to work it out.

525
00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.800
Make sure you wipe your feet
on that carpet right there.

526
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.900
I'll shut the door.

527
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.500
Okay, so here we are.

528
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.100
Fresh paint job, new lamps.
It's all right for now.

529
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.500
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

530
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.800
You know, for now, at least.
But anyway, here's your area.

531
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.000
That's a Sealy ostropedic.
I got that new.

532
00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.100
You like Broadway? You know? Yeah.

533
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.900
'Cause I got tickets, you know,
like Legally Blonde and Wicked.

534
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.700
Wicked's a very good one.
I don't go too often,

535
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.400
but when I do,
I go and see that one.

536
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.300
Is that you?

537
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.900
Yeah, don't mind those,

538
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.100
that's me, Jack and
Martinez, you know, and...

539
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.100
Well, we were going to be
these moguls, you know?

540
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.000
We used to sell tickets
at the Garden.

541
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.700
It was when
we first got here.

542
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.200
So you ain't
from here, either?

543
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.500
Are you kidding me? I'm from
a place with some culture.

544
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.400
Chicago, you know?

545
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.200
But I guess you've got
your own story, too, right?

546
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.600
You left your suitcase
out here.

547
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.300
What, you got
gold in there?

548
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.600
My father used to always say, "Stay
business, ready for business."

549
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.200
Well, you got to...

550
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.400
So you got a plan
or something?

551
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.500
You know, like a big plan
with this fight stuff?

552
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.300
Yeah, I didn't travel all the way
to New York just to be some hustler.

553
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.300
I figured I'd save up some cash,
play some professional ball.

554
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.000
Open up a IHOP. You know,
with an office in it

555
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.600
and my name on the door.

556
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.900
What, like an International
House of Pancakes?

557
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.300
Turns out all I ever was
was a two-bit hustler.

558
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.400
Well. Guess that's not
so bad though, right?

559
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.600
Well, by definition, that's just
somebody who can't win, that wins.

560
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.300
We just won.

561
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.400
I'm just saying.
You know, if that's...

562
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.400
Get you some rest,
Shawn MacArthur.

563
00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.900
Go to sleep. We got
a big fight coming up.

564
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.300
$10,000, right?

565
00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.500
Yup.

566
00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.700
Jerome. This
is Jerome, right?

567
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.600
Looks like
we're here.

568
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.000
Yeah. Look at this tough.

569
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.500
I bet they won't complain about somebody

570
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.700
putting up new buildings
around here.

571
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.800
Come on, you guys,
get in.

572
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.900
It took you
long enough, man.

573
00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.900
That guy's
waiting on you.

574
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Shawn, ready to
get your ass busted?

575
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.500
This is where you take me,
Harvey? That's for suckers, man.

576
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.200
Hello, ladies. This is
what I'm talking about.

577
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.200
What's up, girls? Yeah.

578
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.700
How you doing?
She's cute, yo.

579
00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.200
I like that.

580
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.700
You're cute, why you got a mad face?

581
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.900
Put a smile on your
face. Not my fault.

582
00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.100
I wonder why I don't come
to the Bronx that often.

583
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.100
You know this
kid, right?

584
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.900
Yeah, man,
he's a big dude.

585
00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.600
Don't get too close.

586
00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.600
Yeah, thanks for that.

587
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.200
There you go,
there comes the king.

588
00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.700
Yeah. Get a good
look at that, all.

589
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.600
Bring out the cash, papa.
Bring out the cash.

590
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.100
Do it.

591
00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.500
Whoop his ass.

592
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.200
Come on.
Come on, Shawn.

593
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.000
Move, Shawn! Move, Shawn!
Stick and move!

594
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.800
Work it! That's what
I'm talking about!

595
00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.800
Ah! My throat!

596
00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.100
Come on, Shawn.

597
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.600
Shawn! Shawn!

598
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.300
No, no! No, Shawn! Shawn!

599
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.100
What are you doing?

600
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.900
He knocked my shit over!

601
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.400
My ear!

602
00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.200
Hey, what are you doing?

603
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.700
We don't want no trouble!
We don't want no trouble!

604
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.700
Hey, come on, move!
We don't want no trouble!

605
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
I don't want no trouble!

606
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.900
I swear to God,
I don't want no trouble!

607
00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.600
Come on, open the door!

608
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.100
Push gas!

609
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.700
Yo, my ear, man!

610
00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.500
He's okay, right?

611
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.000
Yeah, his ear's a little
messed up, but he's all right.

612
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.600
He didn't... Did he
say it was a dog?

613
00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.900
You know, he didn't fill out
no police report or nothing?

614
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.800
A dog?
Yeah, a dog.

615
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.700
Can you call him?

616
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.000
Yeah. Nobody's
getting paid.

617
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.600
I'm going inside.

618
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.900
You should put some ice on that hand.

619
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Gotcha.

620
00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.900
It was a good
fight, man.

621
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.300
Thanks, man.

622
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.800
Hey.
All right.

623
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.200
We really ain't
getting paid?

624
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.300
We ain't getting
nothing

625
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.200
'cause of them damn
maniacs in the Bronx.

626
00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.100
I really need money,
you know.

627
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.100
Really.

628
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.000
Look, I'm gonna work
something out, okay?

629
00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.200
Okay.

630
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.900
I'm late every day
for work.

631
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.600
It doesn't matter.
Go, do your job.

632
00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.500
I will, and the last
time, it wasn't done.

633
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.000
Please, let me do the job. Okay.

634
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.500
Lila, you're going to be good,
okay? Remember what I told you.

635
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.600
Abuela, I know,
I'm just telling you.

636
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.700
I'm telling you,
I'm reminding you

637
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.900
because you forget a lot
of things, you know?

638
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.400
Take it easy, young lady.
Let me go.

639
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.100
Out? Okay, out.

640
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.600
Let me go.
You relax.

641
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.400
Are you sure you know
how to get home safely?

642
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.700
You make me excited.
I know how to drive

643
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.000
better than you,
you know that.

644
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.300
Okay. Bye.
You know better.

645
00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.500
Oh, my goodness,
what kind of lady?

646
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.400
Be good, Lila.

647
00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.300
Oh, my God.

648
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.000
Huh?

649
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.800
It's a funny thing, us
keeping meeting like this.

650
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.400
Are you going
into work now?

651
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.100
Yeah. What are
you doing here?

652
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.200
I was just walking by, for the past
two hours, hoping you'd show up.

653
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.600
Oh, stalking? Okay.

654
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.800
No, I just wanted to see
if you wanted to come

655
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.800
get something
to eat with me.

656
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.000
I have to work.
I have 20 minutes.

657
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.100
Just like...

658
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.000
Twenty minutes? You're the
first one here anyway, come on.

659
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.600
Remember, I've been here for
a while. So you want to go?

660
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.100
Yeah? I have to be back, though,

661
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.500
'cause I work here. I'll
get you back, come on.

662
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.100
Twenty minutes.
Twenty minutes.

663
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.500
Like, you don't have to
go if you don't want to go.

664
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.900
Twenty minutes.
Okay, let's go.

665
00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.100
Twenty minutes.

666
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.300
If my boss calls me,
I have to go.

667
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.800
Okay, let's go.

668
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.100
Thank you.

669
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.000
Here, let me get that for you. Oh, okay.

670
00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.400
I'll get you some sparkling water, okay?

671
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.100
Okay, thanks.
Is that good?

672
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.400
Yeah, yeah.
No, that's good.

673
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.600
So, is this
okay for you?

674
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.000
No, this is good, this
is good. This is...

675
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.100
It's good? Okay.

676
00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.200
I'm trying to figure out
what I'm gonna eat.

677
00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.600
I think I'm just gonna
have a calamari.

678
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:01.700
Okay.
By: BackFire

679
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.600
You know,
I ain't that hungry.

680
00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.900
WAITRESS: All right.

681
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.800
You're not hungry?

682
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:10.500
No, not really. Thank
you, though. I'm good.

683
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.200
So, that little girl in the
car, that was your daughter?

684
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.000
Yeah.

685
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.600
She seems sweet. I saw the
way she was looking at you.

686
00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.500
Yeah, she's sweet.

687
00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.800
What? I'm sorry.
There's a big pink thing

688
00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.000
coming down the road.

689
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.300
Yes.

690
00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.800
That's pink bunny man.

691
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.900
You think that's funny?

692
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.300
Wow. That's a lot of
bunnies right there.

693
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.800
You want one of them things? No.

694
00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.200
You know, I'm gonna go get
you one, hold on a sec.

695
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.600
No. He's really
gonna go get one.

696
00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.900
Excuse me, sir.

697
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Can I get one
of these bunnies?

698
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.200
Yeah, right on, my man.

699
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.400
How much are they?
$5.

700
00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.400
$5? Here you go. Thank
you very much, sir.

701
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.000
You have a good day, okay?
You too.

702
00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.400
Excuse me.

703
00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.100
Pink bunny.

704
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.200
Thank you.

705
00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.000
You didn't want
that thing, did you?

706
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.200
My daughter's
going to love this.

707
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.400
She thinks the guy's from
outer space or something.

708
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.500
So what's her name?

709
00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.700
Lila.

710
00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:14.900
Lila?
That's a good name.

711
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.600
Oh!

712
00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:18.900
That must be my boss.

713
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
I can't stay. I can't be
late for work again, so...

714
00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.700
Well, you just ordered.

715
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.300
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm
just late. No, no, no, no.

716
00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.600
This is our date.
This is our date.

717
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.900
Don't even worry about it,
I'll wait for the check.

718
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.900
Date?
Yeah, it's a date.

719
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.400
Date, okay.
All right, well...

720
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.400
Yeah, get out of here.

721
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.500
Don't be late.
See you later.

722
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.800
Okay. You're in
a rush always.

723
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.100
Sorry, I know.

724
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.500
Here you go.

725
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.700
Thank you.

726
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.400
Harv.

727
00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.000
What the hell is
wrong with you?

728
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.300
What is this?

729
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.100
What happened to the
whole, I don't know,

730
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.200
"be ready for business,
business ready" thing, huh?

731
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.400
When I'm not being chased
out of the damn Bronx

732
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.300
trying to hustle up you some
money, I'll be a little more alert.

733
00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.200
That ain't my fault.

734
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.800
In fact, they actually want you
for another fight this Friday.

735
00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.700
Are you up for that?

736
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.000
Yeah. How'd you do that?

737
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.400
Well, I told you, I got
my connections, you know.

738
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.200
It wasn't easy either.

739
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.600
How much this time?

740
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.100
Well, that's what I want
to talk to you about,

741
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.100
but give me a second, I
need to put my clothes on.

742
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.900
It's about this guy you're
about to go up against.

743
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.400
You know, I know you're a
tough guy and everything, Shawn,

744
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.100
but you're not
going to beat him.

745
00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.100
But he's gonna... Come
on, I can handle myself.

746
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.500
I know you can, that's why,

747
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.000
when he puts you
in the choke move,

748
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.200
you're gonna go to
sleep, it's that easy.

749
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.100
What are you saying?

750
00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.500
I think you know
what I'm saying.

751
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.800
No, I don't know what
you're saying.

752
00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.000
Sounds like you're saying
you want me to throw it.

753
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.800
Well, whatever you want
to call it, you know?

754
00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.300
We're gonna make some money,
not like up in the Bronx.

755
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.800
You're complaining about
that whole thing, right?

756
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.800
No, I'm not losing.

757
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.400
I know you're
not gonna lose,

758
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.700
you're gonna do what
I'm telling you to do.

759
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.800
I appreciate everything
you did for me.

760
00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:49.100
But, you know, the only way I'm
going to lose is if somebody beats me.

761
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.800
Okay, then, whatever,
let him beat you.

762
00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.100
I'm serious.

763
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.200
Martinez came up
to me, he said,

764
00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.500
"You know, hey, if you go around
with me, that's fine, man."

765
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.600
I don't know.

766
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.800
What?

767
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.000
You and Martinez what?

768
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.200
What do you mean, "what"?

769
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.200
I want to hear why, you
know, you said, "Martinez..."

770
00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.100
I didn't say I was
gonna do anything.

771
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.600
No, I want to know what
you're gonna do, 'cause...

772
00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:19.300
I mean, here I'm trying to talk
to you about making you some money,

773
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.100
and, you know, nobody made
anything up in the Bronx, right?

774
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.200
You know that.

775
00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.400
I know that. I understand. I know.

776
00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.100
And you're gonna threaten me now, right?

777
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.200
What? I'm not
threatening you.

778
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.500
You're not threatening me? I
take you off of a park bench,

779
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.500
and you're going to
threaten me in my house?

780
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.800
Harvey, I ain't
threatening you.

781
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.300
No, I know you're
not threatening me,

782
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.400
'cause you know why?

783
00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.400
'Cause you're gonna get
out of my house now, Shawn.

784
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.000
Look, hold on.
I'm sorry, okay?

785
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.100
No.

786
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.000
No, no.
Get out of my house.

787
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.500
Grab your garbage
and go. Okay?

788
00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.600
Okay.

789
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.500
Hey, there,
Ms. Florence.

790
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.300
Dog's got a demon in it.

791
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.700
Demons.

792
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.300
You know, I gave you
a place to stay, Shawn,

793
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.600
'cause that's
what you needed.

794
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.500
It was a place to stay, it didn't
have any of this other stuff.

795
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.200
I understand that.

796
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.400
You saw that picture I showed
you of Martinez and Jack and me?

797
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.600
I didn't say I was
gonna go with him.

798
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.100
I had a whole
lot then, Shawn.

799
00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:59.900
He broke my leg for $100.
That's crazy, right?

800
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.600
$100.

801
00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.600
All I was saying is,
I wanted to win.

802
00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.100
That's it,
that's all I wanted.

803
00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.000
It's funny, you lose
one step in this game

804
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.500
and everybody leaves you.

805
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.800
At one point, there was
a whole lot of people

806
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.600
that would put a whole
lot of money on me.

807
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.200
You really think you
can beat this kid, huh?

808
00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.800
I hear he's fierce,
you know?

809
00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.800
'Cause if you lose,
you get nothing.

810
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.600
You win, you get...

811
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.000
You get $30,000.

812
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.200
Hmm.

813
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.500
Okay.

814
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.100
Okay, we'll do it.

815
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.800
Hi.

816
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.400
Hey, sweetie.

817
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.100
Hi.
Hi.

818
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.700
How are you?

819
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.500
So what are you
doing here?

820
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.900
Waiting for you
the whole time.

821
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.700
That's a man, bro.

822
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.200
You're a man?

823
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.700
Hell, no.

824
00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.800
Sit.

825
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.000
Thank you.

826
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.200
I'll be right back.

827
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.000
Z, fold this up.

828
00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:23.900
Harvey, you know you got no
business in a place like this, right?

829
00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.900
Come on, Shawn.

830
00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:40.800
Shit!

831
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.500
Holy shit!

832
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.900
Yeah! Yeah!

833
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.100
Get out of there!

834
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.400
Get out!

835
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Pick his ass up!
Come on! Get up!

836
00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.800
Yeah! Yeah!

837
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.300
There it is!

838
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.300
Yeah!

839
00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.700
Yo, Shawn, get up.

840
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.800
We won!

841
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:37.100
Yeah, baby! We won!
Get up, get up, yeah!

842
00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:40.000
No more deliveries tonight, man. You!

843
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.400
Your man
got knocked out!

844
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.700
What, baby! That's us!

845
00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.700
What! You saw that!
You saw that! That's us!

846
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.500
Yeah, baby!

847
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.200
Well, looks like
Harvey's got a winner.

848
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:02.000
That's us, baby,
all the way!

849
00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.600
Get out of the car...

850
00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.300
No, no.
I'm proud of you.

851
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.700
You put the works on
Bruce Lee, though, man!

852
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.900
I got to give
it to you.

853
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.400
Get out of my car.

854
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.700
Come on, Harv. Let me out.

855
00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:17.900
Come on,
Harvey, let's go.

856
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.600
Let's get a drink,
Harvey.

857
00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.600
Aren't you going
to have one?

858
00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.000
No, I don't want to. Go, it's
your night, have a good night.

859
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.400
Man, it's raining,
come on.

860
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.900
I'm going to go home and
count my money. Leave me alone.

861
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.800
All right, grandpa.

862
00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.600
Don't get in no trouble.
I'm serious, though.

863
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.600
Come on, serious.
Come in, just have one.

864
00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.200
I ain't got nothing, go.

865
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.000
Thanks for tonight.

866
00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.700
Thanks, Renee,
I appreciate it.

867
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.900
Yes, sir.

868
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.700
Please tell me you're not still
putting money in your sock.

869
00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:00.400
What'd your father
used to call that?

870
00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:04.400
Niggerish, that's what
it was, right?

871
00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.100
So this is who you hanging
out with these days, Shawn?

872
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.700
These your boys?

873
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.300
Saw you step out your fancy
stretch limousine there.

874
00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:20.200
What, did you all pass
around a hat to get that?

875
00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.000
Take up a collection?

876
00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.800
You know, the only enjoyment
I got back in college, Shawn,

877
00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:27.300
was watching
your asshole father

878
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.700
humiliate your shit
all over the place.

879
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.000
Really?

880
00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.400
Until your bitch-ass cold-clocked
him in front of the whole gym.

881
00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.500
Come on!

882
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.800
I'm right here!

883
00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.900
Do something!
I'm right here!

884
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.200
Shawn! Look at me!

885
00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:49.500
Like your bitch-ass daddy.

886
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.900
Shawn, Shawn,
what are you doing?

887
00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.600
I ain't your father.

888
00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.300
You can't go to
a club and have fun.

889
00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.400
That's right. I'm cool.
I'll see you around.

890
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.900
Let's get out of here.

891
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:12.600
It's ridiculous. I don't
even... I can't stand him.

892
00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.300
I just... It's not late.

893
00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:25.200
This guy's always putting
these notes on people's doors.

894
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.000
It's not late,
though. Sorry.

895
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.500
It's okay.

896
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.300
I hit you with
the door. So...

897
00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.500
This is my living room.

898
00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.900
I have to go and check
on Lila, so have a seat.

899
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.500
It's nice, right?

900
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.700
It's really nice.

901
00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.100
Thank you.

902
00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.600
Big TV.

903
00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.500
It is, right?
Yeah.

904
00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:49.200
Okay.
Okay.

905
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.900
Hi, I'm Shawn.

906
00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.000
I'm Zulay's friend.

907
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:04.600
She brought
me over to...

908
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.700
Zulay. Zulay.

909
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:10.400
What happened?

910
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.100
This is...
I'm sorry, this is...

911
00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.400
This is Shawn.
Shawn, this is...

912
00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:14.700
I don't care
who is he.

913
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.400
I care why you bring anybody
at this time to the house.

914
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:19.500
He look like
a criminal.

915
00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:20.600
I know...

916
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:22.700
You're not supposed to bring
nobody at this time to the house.

917
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.700
I'm sorry... Don't be sorry.
Don't do that to me no more.

918
00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:25.900
Okay?

919
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.500
Please,
don't say "por favor."

920
00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.200
I don't want to hear nobody
in the house at this time.

921
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.100
Hi. What are you
doing up this late?

922
00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:37.900
What's that?

923
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.100
My pink bunny.

924
00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.800
Sorry. What are
you doing up?

925
00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:42.500
My grandma thinks
you killed someone.

926
00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.900
He didn't kill somebody.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

927
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.100
Why are you up, baby?

928
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.300
LILA: I want to see
the scary man.

929
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.500
I hear that I'm gonna
cook for you.

930
00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:57.000
I'm gonna do it, but as soon as
you eat, please, you got to go.

931
00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:58.500
Okay?
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

932
00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.500
Look at the way you are.
Look at you.

933
00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.700
Please, it's okay.

934
00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:02.700
I'm sorry, actually, you
know what? Look at you. Look!

935
00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:04.400
You know what?
I need some thread.

936
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:05.700
What a shirt.

937
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:06.900
I'm going to
fix it for him.

938
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.900
I'm gonna take a needle and do some job.

939
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.900
That way he don't
gotta stay like that.

940
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.300
You don't feel bad?
I do.

941
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.300
What kind of men look
like that on the street?

942
00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.500
Thank you so
much for the...

943
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:20.300
Come on, no. Back.
Back, let's go back.

944
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.900
LILA: I don't want
to go to bed.

945
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.300
Let's go back,
back to sleep.

946
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.600
Mmm-hmm.

947
00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.100
Uh-huh?

948
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:36.700
Shawn has something
he wants to tell you.

949
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:37.900
What?

950
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.200
I don't understand what you
talk. Talk English, Spanish?

951
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.100
Okay.

952
00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.500
She's wide awake.

953
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.700
This is going good.

954
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I don't know, so... Hey, that
notice that was on your door,

955
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.900
everything all right?

956
01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.300
Like, if you...

957
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.900
You know,
if you need anything.

958
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.600
Just let me know.

959
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:17.800
So...

960
01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.200
That guy, Evan, from
the club, you know him?

961
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.700
Yeah. I mean,
yeah, I know him.

962
01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.300
How do you know him?

963
01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.700
Well, I don't, I just...

964
01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.700
People were talking about
him at the club all night.

965
01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.200
I guess he's a pro or something?
What, does he fight? A boxer?

966
01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.800
Yeah, I mean,
a couple, you know,

967
01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.900
the guys at the club
or whatever,

968
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.800
we just came back
from this...

969
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.600
You know, it's not a
professional thing, but...

970
01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.300
Out in, like, you know,
Korea land,

971
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.800
we just came
from a fight, too.

972
01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.600
You know,
it went pretty well.

973
01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.500
So you're a fighter?

974
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.900
No, I mean, yeah.

975
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.100
But not professional. Just,
you know... I don't know...

976
01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.900
I got this guy, he's an
agent/coach sort of thing.

977
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I mean, it's been going
pretty good, though.

978
01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.700
What?
I don't know.

979
01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.800
So how do you know all
those guys at the club?

980
01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.400
I don't. I...

981
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.800
I don't even know
your name, really.

982
01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.300
What's your name?
Your last name?

983
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.100
MacArthur.

984
01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.900
Shawn MacArthur. Like
a knight. I like it.

985
01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.400
What are you
thinking about?

986
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.600
So...

987
01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:56.700
Simple as that.

988
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.300
I can fix this for you.

989
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.700
Hmm?

990
01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.700
I want to fix
this for you.

991
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.500
It's not so bad.
You want to fix it?

992
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.700
Mmm-hmm.

993
01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.600
I want to kiss you.

994
01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.700
Come on...

995
01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:25.900
Why are you shaking?

996
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.200
Because I lied about
being able to sew.

997
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.700
It looks like
you're doing a good job.

998
01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.800
Look at that mess.

999
01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.000
Wow, I am shaking.

1000
01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.000
Wait, come here for a second.

1001
01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.400
Give me your finger.

1002
01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.600
Make a wish.

1003
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.500
I got mine,
you got yours?

1004
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.700
Mmm-hmm.

1005
01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.500
I do.

1006
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.900
Excuse me! You got to go.
I'm sorry. I know.

1007
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.200
Enough is enough.
Please go.

1008
01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:12.300
Yes, ma'am.

1009
01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.000
I believe it's enough
for today.

1010
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.600
You can meet
later today.

1011
01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:16.700
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

1012
01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.700
Just a second to say bye.

1013
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.700
No second. Come in.
You come in.

1014
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.900
Thank you so much, Mrs.
Valez, I appreciate it.

1015
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.500
I'm no Mrs. Valez,
I'm Mrs. Guzman. Okay?

1016
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.700
And you got to go. Go.

1017
01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.300
Give me one second
to say bye, please.

1018
01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.800
Oh, my goodness, you give
me so much trouble today.

1019
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.300
I'm sorry.

1020
01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.900
She could have come a little
bit later, that's for sure.

1021
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
That would have
been nice.

1022
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.100
Totally. I know.

1023
01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.700
Okay, so...

1024
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.100
Okay.

1025
01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.600
Good night, yeah...

1026
01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.300
So I'm going to
see you again?

1027
01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.700
Yeah.
Yeah. When?

1028
01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.800
You sleeping?

1029
01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:05.000
Who can sleep with all
that banging up there?

1030
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.300
Told you we'd win, huh?

1031
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.500
Did you get our money?

1032
01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.600
Right at it, huh?

1033
01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:15.800
Yes, sir.

1034
01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.800
Look, I know we already had a
fight, but any word on another one?

1035
01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:21.300
I just want to make sure
we're capitalizing

1036
01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.100
on everything we got
going on here.

1037
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.800
I told you, if you like,
anything I got,

1038
01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.000
the tickets, the hats,
the sneakers,

1039
01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.600
you can sell those until
I get you another fight,

1040
01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.000
if that's what
you want to do.

1041
01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:34.300
Go ahead,
turn around.

1042
01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.500
Huh?

1043
01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.400
You wanna get paid,
right?

1044
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.200
Go ahead, man, get it,
I ain't gonna rob you.

1045
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.500
I know you're not
gonna rob me,

1046
01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.700
'cause you're gonna
turn around.

1047
01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:43.200
After tonight,
you don't trust me?

1048
01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.700
Okay, fine.
I've turned around.

1049
01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.000
This is me,
all right?

1050
01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.300
I've turned around,
go ahead.

1051
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.000
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

1052
01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:51.000
I've turned around, go.

1053
01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.900
I was with this girl
from the club tonight.

1054
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.200
Keep looking and you're
going to be with her now.

1055
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.400
You can turn around now.

1056
01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.200
Man, she got a daughter.

1057
01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:13.100
She's kind of having a little
trouble with the rent, I think.

1058
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.700
I kinda wanted
to help her.

1059
01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.200
Stop smiling at me, I know
what you're going to say.

1060
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.800
Yeah, I bet...

1061
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.500
Why wouldn't I
help her, then?

1062
01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:27.000
Beyond the kid and
the need for money...

1063
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.700
Why you gotta break
everything down?

1064
01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.700
That's your problem, man,
you don't trust nobody.

1065
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800
Here you go.

1066
01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.400
I'm never trusting you,
you and your suitcase.

1067
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.700
My suitcase?

1068
01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.800
Yeah, your suitcase
don't trust nobody either.

1069
01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.200
There's $10,000 right here.

1070
01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.400
Yeah. Nice, isn't it?

1071
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.100
I was right, wasn't I?

1072
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.700
Look, I just...

1073
01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:53.200
We shouldn't be selling
tickets and sneakers no more.

1074
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.800
I tell you, we gotta... This
is what we're doing right now.

1075
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.100
So...

1076
01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:04.700
This girl. She works
over at the Marquee?

1077
01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.700
Yeah, Zulay.

1078
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.300
Zulay. She's nice, man.

1079
01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.000
Zulay.
Yeah.

1080
01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.800
Okay.

1081
01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.000
You get some rest,
all right?

1082
01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.300
There's $10,000
right here.

1083
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.200
Yeah. Get some rest,
all right?

1084
01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.800
Hey, you know
where Zulay is?

1085
01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.400
What do you want
to talk about?

1086
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.600
Isn't there something
you should be telling me?

1087
01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.700
What are you talking
about, Harvey?

1088
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.000
You're gonna
make me say it?

1089
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.000
Why didn't you tell me that
you were sleeping with him?

1090
01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.400
Why couldn't
you tell me that?

1091
01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.500
'Cause I don't have to tell
you everything. That's why.

1092
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.200
Now you want him
paying your bills?

1093
01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:55.800
I did not ask him
to pay my bills.

1094
01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.900
Are you kidding me?

1095
01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:01.000
You're bringing him around your
daughter, you like him like that?

1096
01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.400
What, you think he's
better than me, right?

1097
01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.400
No. That's...

1098
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.500
You think you're
better than me,

1099
01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:10.000
that's why you fill his
head with all this garbage.

1100
01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.100
About riding off
into the sunset,

1101
01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.300
like this is a movie
or something, huh?

1102
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.400
No, no, come here I'm talking
to you. Don't touch me.

1103
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.400
I'm talking to you.

1104
01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.500
Don't touch me.
Stop it.

1105
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.600
If he decides to up
and leave you tomorrow,

1106
01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.300
you think you're
part of his plans?

1107
01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.600
You think
your daughter is?

1108
01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.400
Maybe. What about your grandmother?

1109
01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.500
You're always so paranoid.

1110
01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:33.900
Yeah, that's what I am,
I'm paranoid. I'm paranoid.

1111
01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.400
You still believe
in fairy tales.

1112
01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.100
But you think
I'm paranoid, okay.

1113
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.500
Does he know
how we met?

1114
01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:47.900
You in the back seat,
sleeping in your car,

1115
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.200
with your daughter
in the front seat?

1116
01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:54.300
Is that something
to be paranoid about?

1117
01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.600
Okay.

1118
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.600
You think that little thing
right here between your legs

1119
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.500
is gonna make everything
okay, don't you?

1120
01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.400
That's what you think.

1121
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.800
It isn't.

1122
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.900
You use that on him.

1123
01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.000
Don't put no more
garbage in his head.

1124
01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.800
Yo, check this out, yo.

1125
01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:30.300
Check what out, this
dirty-ass crib you got?

1126
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.000
There are bare wires
laying around, man.

1127
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Clean this shit up.

1128
01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.600
When was the last time
you cleaned this shit?

1129
01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:38.400
Shut up, bro, I'm about to kick you out.

1130
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:42.800
Evan Hailey KO's Richards.
It's your man from the club.

1131
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.900
This dude's corny.

1132
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.500
No, check it. A dude like this
man, you got to take serious, man.

1133
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.300
Yeah, look
how he punches.

1134
01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.200
He look like he's punching like a
girl, but those punches hurt, man.

1135
01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:54.600
It's your man, Shawn.
Who is that?

1136
01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.100
That's that dude
from the club, bro.

1137
01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.800
No, man, he's the real deal.
Yo, Shawn, no disrespect, man,

1138
01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.400
he's fighting for real
money in real venues.

1139
01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:04.100
Shawn over here
bullshitting with us.

1140
01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.900
Look at you, Harvey.

1141
01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:57.000
You know, you've been doing
that for some time now.

1142
01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:10.000
It's called bi-polar
or manic depressive.

1143
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.600
What? What?

1144
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.300
Oh, my God.

1145
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.300
Harvey, come in. Come
in, sit down. Come in.

1146
01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.600
We were just talking about
you. Come in, come in.

1147
01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:23.200
Special occasion, you
got the suit broke out.

1148
01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.500
Nice suit.

1149
01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.800
Jacket, at least.

1150
01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.600
CHRISTOPHER: That's nice.

1151
01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.200
Beautiful,
you're looking good.

1152
01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.300
MARTINEZ: Not bad, Harvey.

1153
01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.700
Listen, I didn't
come here, you know,

1154
01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:34.900
to take up a whole
lot of your time.

1155
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.100
I'm just here
to tell you

1156
01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.900
that if you've got
something for Shawn...

1157
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Look at little Harvey,
he's like a little kid.

1158
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.200
He's very excited, like he
has a secret to share with us.

1159
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.300
What's the secret,
Harvey?

1160
01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.300
I'm just saying, if you...

1161
01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.800
If you got something for us,
we're ready to go, you know.

1162
01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.300
He's the biggest draw
in this town,

1163
01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.800
and if you're ready for
something, we're ready for it.

1164
01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.000
Wow.

1165
01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.200
It must be very hard for you
to come in here and grovel

1166
01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:05.900
in front of all of us
here. Especially Martinez.

1167
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.600
You know, Jack, I don't have to
stay here and take this from you.

1168
01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.500
Guess what, Harvey?

1169
01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.600
We were talking about
you and we said that

1170
01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.700
maybe we should put your
man in one of our fights.

1171
01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:24.200
A big fight. $100,000
to the winner, Harvey.

1172
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.000
MARTINEZ: Harvey's excited, huh, Harvey?

1173
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.800
You excited, Harvey?

1174
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:31.900
$100,000.

1175
01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.400
Evan Hailey's going to
rock your boy's world.

1176
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.800
Time out. He couldn't
wait to tell you that one.

1177
01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:40.400
See, this is the way
it's going to be.

1178
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:43.400
Evan Hailey versus
Shawn MacArthur.

1179
01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.900
And we're going to play
up this whole thing

1180
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.100
about how they went
to the same school,

1181
01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.700
you know,
the education rivalry.

1182
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.700
Rivalry for education.

1183
01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.000
Okay.
I know.

1184
01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:07.800
As soon as we
get the word out,

1185
01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:10.100
the phone's just going
to ring off the hook.

1186
01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:14.200
We'll let both
of you know.

1187
01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.300
Harvey, you sure you're
ready for this, Harvey?

1188
01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.900
Can't help but keep
calling my name, huh?

1189
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.800
I don't know, Harvey,
maybe I'm stupid, you know?

1190
01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:49.000
But I'm not stupid enough to think
that Shawn's going to win this.

1191
01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.400
That's stupid, Harvey.
Yeah, really.

1192
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.900
Really?

1193
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
You just don't know how
good he is, you know?

1194
01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.800
Yeah, I do.
That's why I got Evan.

1195
01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.200
And the loser gets shit,
Harvey. And you still get shit.

1196
01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.500
Hey, man.

1197
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.100
We need to take a walk
and talk for a second.

1198
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.700
Okay.

1199
01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.000
So you gonna tell me?

1200
01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:32.300
Well, I got you
another fight.

1201
01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.700
Yeah? How much?

1202
01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:39.300
$100,000.

1203
01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:42.400
What?

1204
01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.500
Yeah.

1205
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.600
They want us to fight
Evan Hailey.

1206
01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.000
He's your opponent.

1207
01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:58.500
Great.

1208
01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:06.800
I'm taking all my money and
I'm placing it against us.

1209
01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.600
You ain't got no money.

1210
01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.100
You have any idea
how much money

1211
01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:16.500
I can raise for
something like this?

1212
01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.800
Then raise it and
put it on us to win.

1213
01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:21.000
People like a guarantee,
Shawn.

1214
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.500
Then guarantee it.

1215
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.800
You saw Jerry,
those Wall Street guys,

1216
01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.700
even Martinez would
get in on this.

1217
01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.900
We're talking
real money.

1218
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.400
No, you're talking
about money.

1219
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:30.800
No, come on, Shawn.

1220
01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.400
What do you think, there's a
trophy involved in all of this?

1221
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.800
Nobody cares about it.

1222
01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:40.000
And if we lose, you know we get
nothing. You get that, right?

1223
01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.700
What? Come on, Shawn.

1224
01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:44.500
Look, all right, look...

1225
01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.800
You think I don't
understand that I'm nothing?

1226
01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.100
I'm nothing, I get it.
I ain't worth nothing.

1227
01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.300
Nobody said anything like
that. I mean, come on.

1228
01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.100
All I'm saying is that
I don't want to lose.

1229
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.900
That's all I'm saying
is I don't want to lose.

1230
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I'm telling you, Shawn...

1231
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.700
Look, I know it sounds
stupid to you.

1232
01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.800
It's stupid.
But that's what I...

1233
01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:02.600
I don't want to do it,
so I won't. Okay?

1234
01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:03.800
Cut all that stuff,
man, listen to me.

1235
01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:05.000
I mean it.

1236
01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.200
Listen, listen.
I'm talking to you.

1237
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:08.300
Harvey.

1238
01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.900
What, you gonna hit me?

1239
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
No, I'm not gonna
hit you... I'm sorry.

1240
01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.500
You think I'm your
father?

1241
01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.300
You're going to slap me around
like I'm your father, huh?

1242
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.100
Okay, okay, I get it.

1243
01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:19.300
You think I don't know
who you are, Shawn.

1244
01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.200
What?
I know all about you.

1245
01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:24.900
I said, can the moral
garbage with me, Shawn.

1246
01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.200
It don't work here.

1247
01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:31.400
Harvey, you don't ever
talk about my father, okay?

1248
01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.100
You gonna hit me?

1249
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.600
You don't ever
talk about my father.

1250
01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.200
Hey.

1251
01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:56.400
So you came back.

1252
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.000
You know me, the stalker.

1253
01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.200
You caught me
taking a shower.

1254
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.200
So, what are you
doing here?

1255
01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:09.300
Nothing, I was just... I don't
know, just kinda wanted to see you.

1256
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.200
Okay, well, come in.

1257
01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.200
My grandmother has
Lila, so, come in.

1258
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.500
I know it's really
hot in here, so,

1259
01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.900
if you want, just grab a
seat and I'll be right back.

1260
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.800
Hey, listen.
Look, I made some money

1261
01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.300
and I kinda wanted to help
you with the notice that I saw

1262
01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.800
on the door the other day.

1263
01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:34.300
That's really... No...
That's sweet, but...

1264
01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.400
No. For Lila.

1265
01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.600
No, I don't need it.

1266
01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.900
Listen, hold on, hold on.
Just for Lila.

1267
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.400
Hold on a second. Just,
please, just listen.

1268
01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:44.000
I don't know what
I'm trying to say...

1269
01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.700
The last thing I want
to do is upset you.

1270
01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.800
All I want...

1271
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:53.000
You came in here
offering me money.

1272
01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:58.100
Just don't...
It's no big deal, okay?

1273
01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:04.300
I don't know how to...

1274
01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:09.000
What?

1275
01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.500
Your hair smells good.

1276
01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.800
Thank you.

1277
01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.200
You know, when you wash
your hair in the sink,

1278
01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.200
they call it
a Puerto Rican shower.

1279
01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.400
My grandfather used to hate
when people called it that.

1280
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.400
Of course, he can say it.

1281
01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:32.300
I like this,
this is nice.

1282
01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:37.000
I know what
happened with your dad.

1283
01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:39.900
Oh.

1284
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Is that okay?

1285
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:43.900
I read... Me and Lila
were on the computer,

1286
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.100
and we just kinda
stumbled across...

1287
01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.200
Wow...
I'm sorry...

1288
01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:54.700
No... Checking up on me?
That's all right.

1289
01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.000
It's okay?

1290
01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:57.200
Yeah.

1291
01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.400
So you think
I'm crazy now?

1292
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:02.800
No.

1293
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.200
Well, I mean...
You'd be right.

1294
01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:09.100
I mean, I did. I went
a little crazy, so...

1295
01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:14.100
You know that guy Evan,
the other night,

1296
01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.600
at the club, you know,
after the whole thing?

1297
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:16.800
Yeah.

1298
01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.900
We were on the same team
and my dad coached us.

1299
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.800
Man, he loved Evan.

1300
01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.600
I was a freshman, and they
always used to mess with me.

1301
01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:30.200
And I just couldn't take it
no more. I kind of lost it.

1302
01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:34.900
And me and Evan went at it.
And my dad got between us

1303
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.600
and I didn't even
see him, you know.

1304
01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:39.000
I just kinda...
I hit him.

1305
01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.500
I hit my father.

1306
01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:44.600
And I just didn't stop.

1307
01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.000
You know?
I just couldn't stop.

1308
01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.500
My father never forgave
me. 'Cause he shouldn't.

1309
01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.300
I got to go get that.

1310
01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.400
Okay, I have
to get going

1311
01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.300
because I have to go do something
at the club, I realized. I'm sorry.

1312
01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.200
I have to go and do
something at the club

1313
01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.000
that I completely
forgot about. So...

1314
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:21.100
Okay...
Please hurry up.

1315
01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.200
I'll walk you.
I'm hurrying.

1316
01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.700
We do have to go.
I'm sorry, I just...

1317
01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.500
Okay. I heard you the first
time, I'm going, I'm going.

1318
01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:27.700
I'm sorry.

1319
01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.900
It's okay.

1320
01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:33.000
I just forgot I had to
go get this stuff done.

1321
01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:36.400
You okay?

1322
01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.200
Yeah, I'm fine, why?

1323
01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:39.800
Just wondering.

1324
01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:43.600
You're good?
Yeah.

1325
01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.100
Hey, Harvey.

1326
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.300
Wait. What?
What's going on here?

1327
01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.400
Um...

1328
01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:56.200
I was going to tell
you, I know Harvey.

1329
01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:59.700
Wait, hold on. You all know each other?

1330
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.100
Yeah, I know her.
I know her.

1331
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:07.600
Listen...
Wait, how do you know...

1332
01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:10.300
I mean, how do you
know each other?

1333
01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:14.600
What's going on, 'cause, are
you together or something?

1334
01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.400
No.
Listen, Shawn...

1335
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.900
No, no, no...
I'm talking to her...

1336
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
I'm talking...

1337
01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.900
No, no, let me... I just
want to hear it from her.

1338
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.200
Let me talk
to you, okay?

1339
01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.700
What did I say? I said
I'm talking... What now?

1340
01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.700
Shawn...
I want to talk to her.

1341
01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.300
I'm talking to you.
I want to talk to her!

1342
01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.400
Get your hands off me!
Shut up!

1343
01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.900
Get your hands off of
me! Get out of my head!

1344
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.300
Look, everything
isn't what you think.

1345
01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.400
You're not the only one
that worked with me.

1346
01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:37.600
She works with me, too.

1347
01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.500
It's what I was explaining
at the apartment.

1348
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:43.200
Nobody knows we know each
other. She places bets for me.

1349
01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.200
Okay, that's
what it is.

1350
01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:47.500
I was going to
tell you, Shawn.

1351
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:50.700
You asked about my...
You asked about my father.

1352
01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.800
Shawn...
Why would you do that?

1353
01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:04.000
You better learn
to answer your phone.

1354
01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:05.400
Why didn't you answer?
That's all you had to do.

1355
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.400
Why did you call?

1356
01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.400
Why didn't you text me
and say something?

1357
01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.900
Listen, Harvey and I have been
friends for a really long time.

1358
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.100
Listen to me. I should
have told you, I know that.

1359
01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.100
I don't know what I
might say to you, okay.

1360
01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:58.600
Wait. Just listen
to me, okay?

1361
01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.000
Look, I make $11
an hour, okay?

1362
01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:02.300
Is that what you
want to know?

1363
01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.400
I make $11 an hour,
I'm broke.

1364
01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:07.000
I pick up glasses from people
that I hate all night long,

1365
01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:10.900
and I'm not really supposed
to be doing this right now.

1366
01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.000
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

1367
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.600
Because.

1368
01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:25.800
Harvey... We're just friends.
He just gives me this money,

1369
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:29.700
and I just go place bets for him
and that's all there is to it.

1370
01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.300
Nobody even knows that
we know each other.

1371
01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.200
Then why couldn't you
just say that to me?

1372
01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.200
Is this thing still on?

1373
01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:00.000
Listen, man...

1374
01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:01.300
Yeah, I understand.

1375
01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:05.200
Throw it. No one will
ever know the better.

1376
01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:10.700
And you're going to tell me
you're okay with that, huh?

1377
01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:14.200
Yeah.

1378
01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:17.600
Whatever you raise,
I want half.

1379
01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.600
We ain't talking about
anything here, you know.

1380
01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:25.400
No, forget it, then.

1381
01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:27.700
Okay.

1382
01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:29.300
Just like that,
though, huh?

1383
01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.900
Yeah. Just like that.

1384
01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:36.700
All right.

1385
01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:40.300
Then, you know once
you get out there,

1386
01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.500
all those eyes are
going to be on you.

1387
01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:47.200
And if there's even a hint that
you're throwing this thing...

1388
01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:49.400
And that's
both of us dead.

1389
01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.300
You understand
how much money they...

1390
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:56.600
They don't scare me, Harvey.
This city doesn't scare me.

1391
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.100
I'm gonna do what you want. And
you're never going to see me again.

1392
01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:06.000
None of you.

1393
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.000
This isn't tickets,
Harvey.

1394
01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:30.100
You understand there's
$250,000 in this bag.

1395
01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:38.700
And, Harvey, don't make
us come looking for you.

1396
01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:55.700
Nice office, Harvey.

1397
01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.600
Glad you could
make it.

1398
01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:00.200
Yeah, you should
get a receptionist.

1399
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.800
Is he going to listen
to you, Harvey?

1400
01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:09.000
If you don't believe me, he's right
out there, you can ask him yourself.

1401
01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:11.000
I'm asking you,
Harvey.

1402
01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.200
There's $250,000
in here.

1403
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.700
And if he decides
he don't like losing,

1404
01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.400
and by some miracle he wins,
I still want my money, Harvey.

1405
01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:33.400
I don't get my money,
Harvey, I'll kill you.

1406
01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:51.800
Lot of money.

1407
01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.700
Come on in.

1408
01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.200
Zulay, did you have
another dream?

1409
01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.400
It's a lot of money,
Jack.

1410
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.800
Oh, yeah?

1411
01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.700
How much are we
talking about?

1412
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.900
Half a million dollars.

1413
01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:10.500
Hmm?

1414
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.500
So what are you doing
walking around the street

1415
01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.800
with half a million dollars
in your bag?

1416
01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.900
I have investors.

1417
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.100
Investors.

1418
01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:24.500
If it's too much
money, I can...

1419
01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:25.800
Too much?

1420
01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.200
Listen to that.

1421
01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:32.200
She's cleaning up the
dumpster, now she's in the club.

1422
01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.900
Tell your rich-ass and your
drunk-ass investor friends

1423
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.200
that I will be happy
to pay them off.

1424
01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.000
And happier not to.

1425
01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.600
Count it.

1426
01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:44.100
The man
is here. Outside.

1427
01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:50.900
We need to get everybody out on
the terrace so we can do this thing.

1428
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.400
People, the show's
going to start. Outside.

1429
01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:55.500
You have a nice place here. Of course.

1430
01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:58.100
City Hall, I've got
the Woolworth Building.

1431
01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.000
My meditation room.

1432
01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.200
Let's go, people.

1433
01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:13.900
Look, I'll meet you out.

1434
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.800
Let me talk to you
for a second.

1435
01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:17.400
You know what we're
dealing with here, right?

1436
01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:20.200
Let's just go.
Let's get it over with.

1437
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.800
Look at this, Harvey.

1438
01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.500
Now you see how far
you've come?

1439
01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.800
Hey, everybody,

1440
01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:59.900
Jerry invited us all
up here so we could

1441
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.500
catch a glimpse of
his bank account.

1442
01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.100
That's nice, huh?

1443
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.100
Here's to Jerry.

1444
01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.300
But what
the thing is...

1445
01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.400
I mean, the real shit
of this thing is,

1446
01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.600
is what's going on
right here.

1447
01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.200
So, Jerry, right now,
you should step off.

1448
01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:23.100
And gentlemen,
you should step up.

1449
01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.400
Let's go baby, let's go!

1450
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.400
We're going
to sit down, people.

1451
01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:37.400
And these two gentlemen are going
to go toe to toe, blow to blow.

1452
01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:42.000
Whatever goes on
up here, whatever.

1453
01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:47.100
Whatever you do to
each other, whatever.

1454
01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.400
Whatever you say to
each other, whatever.

1455
01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:59.800
In the words of the late,
great, American poet,

1456
01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:02.100
Mr. Marvin Gaye,

1457
01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:07.200
"Let's get it on!"

1458
01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:14.400
Let's go, baby,
let's go! Yeah!

1459
01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:19.000
You froze? Huh?

1460
01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.300
It's a stare-down.

1461
01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.000
Oh.

1462
01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:27.100
It's the evil eye.

1463
01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:33.900
Is that what you gave
your old man? Huh?

1464
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.200
Knock that smile
off his face, let's go!

1465
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.400
Yeah, baby!

1466
01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:56.200
All right. Let's play.
Let's play, Shawn.

1467
01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:59.000
Show him what
you got! Do it!

1468
01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:01.800
Do it, baby!

1469
01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.400
Go on, Shawn! Yeah!

1470
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.400
Get him, Shawn!
Get him! Get him!

1471
01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:51.600
Right here, Shawn.

1472
01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.400
He's talking shit!

1473
01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:02.700
You can't stay there,
Shawn!

1474
01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:23.400
Oh, shit!

1475
01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.600
Hey, hey,
that's it! That's it!

1476
01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:38.700
That's it! That's it!
That's enough! Call it!

1477
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.900
That's it! That's it!

1478
01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.400
Go on, Shawn!
Get up! Get up, bro!

1479
01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:56.400
Get up! Get up!

1480
01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:03.100
Get out of it! Get out of it! Get out!

1481
01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.800
Come on, Shawn!

1482
01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:12.500
You got to fight!
Come on! Get out of it!

1483
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.200
Fight!

1484
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.700
Come on, Shawn! Yeah!

1485
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.400
No! No!

1486
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.800
Harvey, what's
going on, Harvey?

1487
01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:47.900
No!

1488
01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.000
Come on! Yeah!

1489
01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:52.800
Holy shit!

1490
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
No!

1491
01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:51.700
Yeah, boy!

1492
01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.000
Yeah, Shawn!
Yeah, Shawn!

1493
01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:01.200
You got it, Shawn.
Let's start moving, boys.

1494
01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:06.000
Yeah!

1495
01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:07.800
What up now, bitch?

1496
01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:11.200
Harvey, I'd like to
shake your hand, man.

1497
01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:16.800
You're a dead man.

1498
01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:20.100
You're a dead man,
Harvey. Dead man.

1499
01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:21.300
Thank you.

1500
01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.400
You're welcome.

1501
01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.100
What up now, bitch?

1502
01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:31.700
Yeah, baby!

1503
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.700
I'll need a drink
after that, man, right!

1504
01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:03.800
Thank you, Evan,
you fight like a bitch.

1505
01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:07.300
Harvey, we're going out,
VIP Harvey, we out of here.

1506
01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:09.900
Whoa, there he is!

1507
01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:13.300
You're the shit, man.

1508
01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:16.400
Yeah, last night was
great, man. Thanks a lot.

1509
01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:17.600
Thanks for the ride.

1510
01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:19.000
Thanks for
being there.

1511
01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:21.200
Yo, we're going to the club
tonight, kid. You wanna come?

1512
01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:22.900
VIP all night,
drinks all night.

1513
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.200
Come on. Let's go.

1514
01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.200
No, I'm beat up.

1515
01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:27.300
VIP, Harvey. VIP.

1516
01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:30.100
VIP, you all
be careful.

1517
01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:40.000
Well, tonight,
show your butt off.

1518
01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:47.700
You know, I'd be lying if I didn't
say, secretly I wanted you to win.

1519
01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:51.200
That's crazy, right?

1520
01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:55.100
If I wasn't a dead man,
I'd be happy, you know.

1521
01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:58.600
But you killed me
with that, Shawn.

1522
01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:04.100
You know, you do what
you do, you know.

1523
01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:07.500
Look, Shawn,
in a couple of minutes

1524
01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:10.000
there's going to be some men
that's going to come here,

1525
01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:13.200
and you can't be here
when they get here, okay?

1526
01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:37.100
Me and Zulay,
we put it on us to win.

1527
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.100
Yeah.

1528
01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:41.500
We knew you'd
never go for it,

1529
01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:44.200
so we didn't say
nothing, but...

1530
01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:53.900
There's $1 million
in there.

1531
01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:03.000
Business ready
for business, huh?

1532
01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.800
Business ready.

1533
01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:06.200
You taught me that.

1534
01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:07.800
Okay.

1535
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.300
That's a lot of
money in there.

1536
01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:19.800
Mmm-hmm.

1537
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:23.100
No, I'm not kidding, Shawn.
That's a lot of money.

1538
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.900
That's a lot of IHOPs.
We're going to Birmingham.

1539
01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:29.500
Okay...

1540
01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:32.000
You know, we're going
to go and see my family.

1541
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
See what's left of it.
You know what I mean?

1542
01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:38.800
Maybe stop by Chicago,
or something.

1543
01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:43.000
On your way to
Birmingham, Chicago.

1544
01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:44.500
Right. Yeah.

1545
01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:46.100
Mmm-hmm.

1546
01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.300
Why don't you come?

1547
01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.800
So Birmingham is
where you're thinking?

1548
01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:11.000
Yeah.
It's where I'm from.

1549
01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.800
Okay, what we
should do, then...

1550
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.100
Hear me out.

1551
01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:21.600
I think we should go past
Birmingham to some place warm.

1552
01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:23.300
If you're going all the way to Chicago,

1553
01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:25.600
through Birmingham,
whatever...

1554
01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:26.800
Take it to California.

1555
01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:29.600
You know, they've got a whole lot
of great opportunities out there.

1556
01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:31.100
I've been doing
a lot of reading,

1557
01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:33.100
I'm not giving those
people this money.

1558
01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.300
I don't give...
Unless...

1559
01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:39.300
We shouldn't give nobody none
of this. We should just go.

1560
01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:40.800
"'I believe in love,'
said Grandma,

1561
01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:43.700
"I'm going to go to Africa
because my boyfriend is there.

1562
01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:47.700
"And then I change my mind,
maybe. Because love is beautiful."

1563
01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.000
Oh, my God.
It's amazing, Alabama.

1564
01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:54.500
Alabama. Alabama. All the
time, Alabama, Alabama, Alabama.

1565
01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:55.600
Would you
all shut up already?

1566
01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:56.700
You're driving me crazy.

1567
01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:59.400
You're making
my ears bleed in here.

1568
01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:26.100
It's raining,
Harvey. It's raining.

1569
01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:30.800
Harvey, it's always raining.
It's raining, Harvey.

1570
01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.800
It's just rain, rain.

1571
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.200
It's always raining
in this raining town.

1572
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:40.600
Always raining. What am I
supposed to do with the rain?

1573
01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:42.500
Harvey, it's raining.

1574
01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:44.500
It's raining, Harvey.

1575
01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.500
Harvey, it's raining.
