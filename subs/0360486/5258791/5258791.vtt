1
00:01:58.491 --> 00:01:59.319
Manuel?

2
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.703
Manuel?

3
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.183
Decontracte!

4
00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:17.234
Manuel.

5
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.618
I think...

6
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.193
I think I found you one.

7
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.396
Look I called you,

8
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.518
right?

9
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.066
Soon as I couldn't pull it out myself,

10
00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.904
I called you John.

11
00:04:28.955 --> 00:04:30.342
It's ok, it's ok.

12
00:04:30.344 --> 00:04:32.172
We had to tie her down, ok?

13
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.300
It's ok.

14
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.972
This is Constantine.

15
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.890
John Constantine.

16
00:05:34.102 --> 00:05:35.205
Asshole.

17
00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:44.511
Sure.

18
00:06:08.088 --> 00:06:09.140
What the hell?

19
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.652
I need a mirror.

20
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.866
Now.

21
00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:31.711
At least 3 feet high.

22
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.140
Move!
Go, now!

23
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.130
This is Kramer.

24
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.500
Chas Kramer, asshole.

25
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:55.661
Asshole.

26
00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:57.083
What?

27
00:06:58.447 --> 00:06:59.550
This is Kramer.

28
00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.721
Chas Kramer, asshole.

29
00:07:01.846 --> 00:07:02.658
Chas!

30
00:07:03.324 --> 00:07:03.950
What?

31
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:05.263
Move the car.

32
00:07:05.966 --> 00:07:06.729
Why?

33
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.110
Move the damn car!

34
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.907
Chas, move the car.

35
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.874
There, car's moved.

36
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.530
Lift it up over the bed.

37
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.972
Tie that end off.

38
00:07:34.435 --> 00:07:36.379
Hennessy, over the top.

39
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.626
Close your eyes.

40
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.298
And whatever happens,

41
00:07:42.088 --> 00:07:43.199
don't look.

42
00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:56.233
No!

43
00:08:03.814 --> 00:08:05.402
Show yourself.

44
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.338
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

45
00:08:20.564 --> 00:08:21.767
For your boss.

46
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.830
Pull it!

47
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.624
Mamá?

48
00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:53.693
Mamá?

49
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.042
Like I said I found you something,
didn't I John?

50
00:09:32.181 --> 00:09:32.978
Didn't I?

51
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:35.420
What happened in there?

52
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.417
Going to a lot of meetings, I see.

53
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.629
Keeps the voices out so I can sleep.

54
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.864
I have to sleep, John.

55
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.842
I need some help, Father.

56
00:09:55.378 --> 00:09:56.259
You do?

57
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.243
From me?

58
00:09:58.987 --> 00:10:00.055
What kind of...

59
00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:06.750
Hey, listen, I...
That exorcism wasn't right.

60
00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:11.590
Listen to the ether.

61
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.853
Anything unusual,

62
00:10:15.425 --> 00:10:16.761
you let me know.

63
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.205
Come on, you don't
need its protection.

64
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.379
It'll be like back in the day.

65
00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:26.558
A few days.

66
00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:28.531
Ok.

67
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.008
Ok.

68
00:10:30.658 --> 00:10:31.810
For you, John.

69
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.639
John, why would you do that
if you know it's not my car?

70
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.217
I told you to move it.

71
00:10:41.219 --> 00:10:42.724
Right John, you did tell me to move it,

72
00:10:42.738 --> 00:10:44.608
but if you would have told me
there was a 300 pound mirror

73
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.052
you were dropping
with a pissed-off demon,

74
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.600
I would have moved it further, John!

75
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.983
Take Alvarado.
Yeah John I know what to take.

76
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.843
You ever think if you told me more now
that maybe I could help out?

77
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.437
No?
Nope.

78
00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.440
Nope?

79
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.410
Of course it's a nope.

80
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.613
Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

81
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.389
<i>It's been...</i>

82
00:11:47.301 --> 00:11:49.165
<i>two weeks since my last confession.</i>

83
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.927
I killed a man today.

84
00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.022
Another one.

85
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.172
I didn't even...

86
00:12:05.521 --> 00:12:07.271
see his face, I just...

87
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.848
pulled the trigger and he went away.

88
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.747
<i>Most cops go 20 years,</i>

89
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.789
<i>without firing their guns.</i>

90
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.990
<i>Why do I always know
where these guys are?</i>

91
00:12:24.073 --> 00:12:26.487
<i>Where to aim, when to fire.</i>

92
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.992
<i>I'm wondering, is there
something wrong with me, Father?</i>

93
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.594
<i>Something damned?</i>

94
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.952
<i>God has a plan for you.</i>

95
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:39.411
<i>He has a plan for us all.</i>

96
00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:44.041
<i>You mustn't let your faith
be overshadowed by guilt.</i>

97
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.463
<i>Yeah, I'm trying.</i>

98
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.660
<i>I'm trying real hard.</i>

99
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.625
<i>Isabel.</i>

100
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.310
<i>Isabel.</i>

101
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.603
Things I've beaten.

102
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.697
Things most people
never even heard of.

103
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.139
And now I'm gonna be done in by this.

104
00:14:54.178 --> 00:14:56.008
Wouldn't be the first, John.

105
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.918
Come on, Les.

106
00:15:00.908 --> 00:15:02.833
You saved me before,
you can do it again, right?

107
00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.477
This is aggressive.

108
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.593
Twenty years ago,
you didn't wanna be here.

109
00:15:11.153 --> 00:15:12.705
Now you don't wanna leave.

110
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.439
Yeah, that's a good idea.

111
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.040
John, you really need to prepare.

112
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.524
Make arrangements.

113
00:15:27.139 --> 00:15:28.071
No need.

114
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.234
I already know exactly where I'm going.

115
00:15:36.258 --> 00:15:37.273
Morning.
Good morning.

116
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:40.385
Good morning.
Detective.

117
00:15:41.272 --> 00:15:43.250
No, no, no.
Angela, wait.

118
00:15:43.383 --> 00:15:45.086
You don't need to see this, ok?
No.

119
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.491
Give us the room, please.

120
00:16:19.991 --> 00:16:21.236
Isabel.

121
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.448
She fell from the roof?

122
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.198
She jumped.

123
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.410
No.
Look...

124
00:16:37.025 --> 00:16:38.544
I know it's hard to accept.

125
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.102
She was sick.

126
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.618
Isabel would not kill herself.

127
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.511
Angie.

128
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.584
She would not kill herself.

129
00:16:55.586 --> 00:16:56.331
Detective.

130
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.400
Period.
Detective.

131
00:16:57.402 --> 00:16:58.532
Period!

132
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:00.990
Angie,

133
00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:03.141
there were security cameras.

134
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:14.481
Hold the door,

135
00:17:14.483 --> 00:17:16.419
you going down?
Not if I can help it.

136
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.670
A new case?

137
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.659
The big score?

138
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:11.799
The mother lode?

139
00:18:12.402 --> 00:18:14.212
The one you've been waiting for?

140
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.253
Humor me.

141
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.280
Don't I always?

142
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.093
Oh, yeah, that's much obliged.

143
00:18:25.095 --> 00:18:25.917
Thank you.

144
00:18:28.688 --> 00:18:29.918
How you feeling, John?

145
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.920
So, what's new?

146
00:18:36.638 --> 00:18:39.996
Bullet shavings from
the assassination attempt on the pope,

147
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.055
holy-water ampoules,
from the River Jordan,

148
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.226
and, you'll love this,

149
00:18:46.228 --> 00:18:48.372
screech beetle from Amityville.

150
00:18:51.559 --> 00:18:53.077
Yeah, it's funny to you,

151
00:18:53.079 --> 00:18:55.300
but to the fallen that's
like nails on a chalkboard.

152
00:18:55.516 --> 00:18:57.684
What is it, exactly, with you and bugs?

153
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.086
I just like them.

154
00:19:01.931 --> 00:19:02.564
Yeah.

155
00:19:03.154 --> 00:19:04.130
Who doesn't?

156
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.595
Yeah, easy there, hero.

157
00:19:08.072 --> 00:19:09.459
That's dragon's breath.

158
00:19:10.283 --> 00:19:11.908
I thought you couldn't get it anymore.

159
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.982
Yeah, well, I...

160
00:19:14.423 --> 00:19:16.080
know a guy who knows a guy.

161
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:24.058
So...

162
00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:25.691
what's the action?

163
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:28.899
I just pulled a soldier demon

164
00:19:28.983 --> 00:19:30.100
out of a little girl.

165
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.403
Looked like it was trying
to come through.

166
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.343
Yeah, I know how it sounds.

167
00:19:37.369 --> 00:19:39.905
No, we're finger
puppets to them John,

168
00:19:39.907 --> 00:19:41.101
not doorways.

169
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.794
They can work us but...

170
00:19:43.233 --> 00:19:45.342
they can't come
through onto our plane.

171
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.920
Check the scrolls anyway.
See if there is any precedent.

172
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.385
Sure thing, John.

173
00:19:51.432 --> 00:19:52.592
Anything else?

174
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.657
Wouldn't happen to have anything for a...

175
00:19:57.954 --> 00:19:58.843
On the house.

176
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.080
Alright, question.

177
00:20:01.711 --> 00:20:03.678
How much longer do I have
to be your slave John?

178
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.520
You're not my slave, Chas.

179
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.971
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

180
00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.171
Like Tonto or Robin.

181
00:20:14.575 --> 00:20:17.016
Or that skinny fellow with the fat friend.

182
00:20:17.018 --> 00:20:18.008
Right so,

183
00:20:18.212 --> 00:20:20.764
then why don't I apprentice
something besides driving then John?

184
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.792
John?

185
00:20:25.265 --> 00:20:25.995
John?

186
00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.659
I love our little talks, John.

187
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.010
May I take your coat, Mr. Constantine?

188
00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:47.364
No, thanks,
I'm not gonna be staying long.

189
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:49.274
How about you, ma'am?

190
00:20:49.573 --> 00:20:51.706
Oh, no, I'm not staying long either.

191
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.370
I really need to speak with him.
It's very important.

192
00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.430
First come, first served.

193
00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.501
So you're rude no matter where you are.

194
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.566
Father.
Hi.

195
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.775
You have news.
Yes, I spoke with the bishop.

196
00:21:18.955 --> 00:21:19.640
Yes.

197
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.700
I know what you want, son.

198
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.400
Still keeping your all-seeing
eye on me, Gabriel?

199
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:34.567
I'm flattered.

200
00:21:36.601 --> 00:21:37.281
Well,

201
00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:39.379
I could offer something about

202
00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:42.188
how a shepherd leads even
the most wayward of his flock,

203
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.390
but it might sound disingenuous.

204
00:21:45.606 --> 00:21:48.504
She has to have a Catholic funeral, Father.
She has to.

205
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.605
Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin.

206
00:21:51.607 --> 00:21:52.991
She didn't commit suicide.

207
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.839
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules Angela.

208
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.060
Oh, rules.

209
00:21:57.945 --> 00:21:58.798
Father.

210
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.170
David.

211
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.495
This is Isabel.

212
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.201
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

213
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:11.310
Please.

214
00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:13.609
I'm sorry.

215
00:22:17.117 --> 00:22:20.077
I've been seeing some unusual
soul traffic lately.

216
00:22:20.836 --> 00:22:23.066
You might consider
giving me an extension.

217
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.930
I could do your side some good
these days.

218
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.830
You still trying
to buy your way into heaven?

219
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.918
What about the minions I've sent back?

220
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.231
That alone should guarantee my entry.
How many times have I told you?

221
00:22:37.093 --> 00:22:39.005
That's not the way this works.

222
00:22:39.317 --> 00:22:41.332
Why, haven't I served him enough?

223
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.290
What does he want from me?

224
00:22:44.526 --> 00:22:45.785
Only the usual.

225
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.445
Self-sacrifice,

226
00:22:48.142 --> 00:22:49.014
belief.

227
00:22:49.332 --> 00:22:52.334
Oh, I believe, for christ sake.
No, no, you know.

228
00:22:52.719 --> 00:22:53.954
And there is a difference.

229
00:22:54.003 --> 00:22:55.187
You've seen.

230
00:22:55.189 --> 00:22:56.904
I never asked to see.

231
00:22:57.522 --> 00:22:59.706
I was born with this curse.

232
00:22:59.966 --> 00:23:01.526
A gift, John.

233
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.583
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

234
00:23:04.845 --> 00:23:07.461
I'm pulling demons out of little girls.

235
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.070
Who's that for?

236
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.156
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

237
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.723
To earn your way
back into his good graces.

238
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.410
Impossible rules, endless regulations,

239
00:23:20.658 --> 00:23:23.689
who goes up, who goes down and why.

240
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.688
You don't even understand us.

241
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.833
You're the one who should go
to hell, half-breed.

242
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.310
Why me, Gabriel?

243
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.955
It's personal, isn't it?

244
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.310
I didn't...

245
00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.745
go to church enough,
I didn't pray enough I...

246
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.458
I was 5 bucks short
in the collection plate.

247
00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.359
Why?

248
00:24:06.207 --> 00:24:08.005
You are going to die young because,

249
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.140
you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 15.

250
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.180
And you're going to go to hell,

251
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.274
because of the life you took.

252
00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.605
You're fucked.

253
00:24:37.773 --> 00:24:39.286
At least it's nice out.

254
00:24:42.783 --> 00:24:45.149
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

255
00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:54.272
And his punch lines are killers.

256
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.550
John!

257
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.327
Constantine, it's raining! John!

258
00:25:05.727 --> 00:25:06.605
Hey!

259
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:23.691
<i>Twenty-two women were found buried
in the assailant's back yard.</i>

260
00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:27.227
<i>So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match...</i>

261
00:25:27.235 --> 00:25:32.212
<i>Police report she had been physically
penetrated over 100 times and buried alive.</i>

262
00:25:32.316 --> 00:25:36.486
<i>Found locked in a storage freezer,
his head severed and his organs...</i>

263
00:25:36.519 --> 00:25:40.754
<i>He stuffed Holly's body into...</i>

264
00:25:40.855 --> 00:25:43.989
<i>The bodies ravished by the unknown...
He used a small handsaw...</i>

265
00:25:43.991 --> 00:25:46.736
<i>Had nearly decapitated...
Even his eyes were gouged out.</i>

266
00:25:46.738 --> 00:25:48.020
<i>Isabel.</i>

267
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.011
I'm so sorry, lzzy.

268
00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.530
<i>Constantine.</i>

269
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:51.890
Dodson.

270
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:53.961
Hello?

271
00:26:55.466 --> 00:26:56.440
Hello.

272
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.960
Hello?

273
00:28:06.937 --> 00:28:08.994
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

274
00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.985
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

275
00:29:07.044 --> 00:29:08.546
I know where you're going, John.

276
00:29:08.976 --> 00:29:10.615
I know where you're going,
you're going to Midnite's.

277
00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.070
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

278
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.810
It's a haven for those who rise and fall.
I remember reading about this, John.

279
00:29:17.085 --> 00:29:18.889
You read too much kid, it's a bar.

280
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.825
It's a bar?

281
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:21.045
It's a bar.

282
00:29:21.047 --> 00:29:24.081
Papa Midnite is a crusader for good.
He swore the oath of neutrality.

283
00:29:24.625 --> 00:29:26.201
John, the man's a legend.

284
00:29:26.203 --> 00:29:26.882
Yeah.

285
00:29:27.493 --> 00:29:29.634
Can you please get me into
this bar John, please?

286
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.775
I'm begging you John, please?
Please?

287
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:33.749
Sure, you can get in.

288
00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:34.791
I can get in?

289
00:29:35.158 --> 00:29:36.162
If you can get in.

290
00:29:37.929 --> 00:29:39.941
If I can get...
It's a bear though, right?

291
00:29:40.267 --> 00:29:41.895
Or two ducks in, two ducks in a cloud?

292
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:47.228
Two frogs on a bench.

293
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.640
Two frogs on a bench.

294
00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.047
No, no, no.
I'm with the guy you just...

295
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.700
John! John!

296
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.840
I'm with him, though.

297
00:30:01.334 --> 00:30:02.621
Rat in a dress.

298
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.098
Of course it is.
Rat in a dress.

299
00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.955
I'm just testing.
I'm just testing.

300
00:31:03.271 --> 00:31:04.350
Don't get up.

301
00:31:06.194 --> 00:31:08.009
You've been absent some time.

302
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.175
Have you come here with relics to sell?

303
00:31:12.412 --> 00:31:14.794
No, I'm out of that now.
I've been too busy.

304
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:19.670
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up
being bad for your health.

305
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.370
Midnite, Jesus.

306
00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.439
I thought the thing was authentic.

307
00:31:28.222 --> 00:31:29.452
I see now.

308
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.078
Your health is bad for other reasons.

309
00:31:32.369 --> 00:31:33.370
How long?

310
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.255
A few months, maybe a year.

311
00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.566
I thought I heard thunder last night.

312
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.681
Must have been
Satan's stomach growling.

313
00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.699
You're the one soul he'd come
up here himself to collect.

314
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.620
So I've heard.

315
00:31:49.126 --> 00:31:49.699
Well,

316
00:31:50.075 --> 00:31:53.986
I am most certain you did not come
here for a sympathetic shoulder to cry.

317
00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.024
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

318
00:32:01.648 --> 00:32:02.990
They don't like you, John.

319
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.640
How many have you
deported back to hell?

320
00:32:05.853 --> 00:32:07.713
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.

321
00:32:07.715 --> 00:32:10.309
A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.

322
00:32:10.618 --> 00:32:13.443
Clearly I do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

323
00:32:13.538 --> 00:32:14.444
And yesterday,

324
00:32:14.446 --> 00:32:18.146
I saw a soldier demon trying to
chew its way out through a little girl.

325
00:32:18.413 --> 00:32:19.479
Listen John,

326
00:32:19.817 --> 00:32:21.372
demons stay in hell,

327
00:32:21.694 --> 00:32:22.894
angels in heaven.

328
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.986
The great detente of
the original superpowers.

329
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:28.388
Thanks for the
history lesson, Midnite.

330
00:32:28.944 --> 00:32:30.590
You've been a tremendous help.

331
00:32:31.351 --> 00:32:32.186
Now...

332
00:32:35.162 --> 00:32:36.722
I need to use the chair.

333
00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:40.311
John,

334
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.855
forgetting the fact that it
would almost certainly kill you,

335
00:32:44.578 --> 00:32:45.808
you know I am neutral.

336
00:32:46.402 --> 00:32:49.629
And as long as the balance
is maintained, I take no sides.

337
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.193
Before you were,

338
00:32:52.616 --> 00:32:53.756
a bartender.

339
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:57.290
You were one witch doctor against what,

340
00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:58.908
30 Ashgar?

341
00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.147
And I...
You were,

342
00:33:01.774 --> 00:33:02.798
Constantine.

343
00:33:03.653 --> 00:33:05.640
The John Constantine.

344
00:33:07.308 --> 00:33:08.211
Once.

345
00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:12.837
This isn't the usual game, I can feel it.

346
00:33:13.823 --> 00:33:15.263
Something's coming.

347
00:33:17.018 --> 00:33:17.841
Spooky.

348
00:33:19.295 --> 00:33:20.555
Balthazar.

349
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:22.731
That expression alone has...

350
00:33:23.566 --> 00:33:25.422
made my entire night.

351
00:33:25.896 --> 00:33:26.986
I'll make your night.

352
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.960
I'll deport your sorry ass right where
you stand, you half-breed shit!

353
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:34.770
You know the rules of my house.

354
00:33:35.489 --> 00:33:37.502
While here, you will abide by them.

355
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.032
Johnny boy.

356
00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:43.646
Word is,

357
00:33:44.397 --> 00:33:45.812
you're on your way down.

358
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.187
Fresh meat.

359
00:33:52.418 --> 00:33:53.521
Finger-licking good.

360
00:33:55.143 --> 00:33:56.420
We have a meeting now, John.

361
00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:05.618
What?

362
00:34:06.197 --> 00:34:07.247
I didn't catch that.

363
00:34:50.492 --> 00:34:51.954
Welcome to my life.

364
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:03.895
Mr. Constantine.

365
00:35:06.105 --> 00:35:07.373
I saw you...
I remember.

366
00:35:08.897 --> 00:35:10.918
And then I saw you at the...
Regular kismet.

367
00:35:13.132 --> 00:35:15.023
I'd like to ask you a few questions,

368
00:35:15.408 --> 00:35:16.551
if that would be ok.

369
00:35:16.931 --> 00:35:19.008
I'm not really in the talking mood
right now.

370
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.410
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

371
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.359
Please?

372
00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.822
Always a catch.

373
00:35:45.783 --> 00:35:47.698
My sister was murdered yesterday.

374
00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:49.718
Sorry to hear.

375
00:35:49.767 --> 00:35:50.593
Thanks.

376
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.865
She was a patient at Ravenscar.

377
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.997
She jumped off the roof.

378
00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.102
Thought you said she was murdered.

379
00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:00.616
Yeah well,

380
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.463
Isabel would not
have taken her own life.

381
00:36:02.716 --> 00:36:05.450
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

382
00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.518
That's just crazy.

383
00:36:13.466 --> 00:36:14.586
Look, I've...

384
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.679
heard your name around the precinct.

385
00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:19.303
I know the circles you travel in.

386
00:36:19.594 --> 00:36:22.124
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

387
00:36:22.858 --> 00:36:26.725
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

388
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:28.306
She started talking about...

389
00:36:29.002 --> 00:36:30.046
demons,

390
00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:31.379
angels.

391
00:36:31.668 --> 00:36:33.330
Now, I think someone got to her,

392
00:36:33.605 --> 00:36:34.669
Mr. Constantine.

393
00:36:34.671 --> 00:36:37.816
I think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

394
00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:39.414
Some kind of...

395
00:36:39.627 --> 00:36:40.922
legion or...

396
00:36:41.236 --> 00:36:42.037
cult.

397
00:36:43.249 --> 00:36:45.106
Sounds like a theory, detective.

398
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:47.330
Good luck.

399
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.291
Well I thought with your
background, you could at least...

400
00:36:52.745 --> 00:36:54.185
point me in the right direction.

401
00:36:54.535 --> 00:36:55.742
Yeah, ok, sure.

402
00:37:00.231 --> 00:37:01.549
It wasn't a suicide.

403
00:37:02.391 --> 00:37:04.051
My sister was a devout Catholic.

404
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.418
Do you understand that means?
That means if she took her own life...

405
00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.464
Her soul would go straight to hell.

406
00:37:10.453 --> 00:37:11.865
Where she'd be ripped apart,

407
00:37:11.867 --> 00:37:14.947
over and over in
screaming brutal agony,

408
00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.042
for all eternity,

409
00:37:17.434 --> 00:37:18.419
that it.

410
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.211
That about right?

411
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:29.216
Goddamn you.

412
00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:01.670
Detective.

413
00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.700
What if I told you that God
and the devil made a wager,

414
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.360
a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

415
00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.719
I'd tell you to stay on your meds.

416
00:38:11.609 --> 00:38:12.419
Humor me.

417
00:38:13.066 --> 00:38:14.880
No direct contact with humans.

418
00:38:14.882 --> 00:38:15.917
That would be the rule.

419
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.407
Just influence.

420
00:38:17.409 --> 00:38:18.510
See who would win.

421
00:38:18.535 --> 00:38:20.547
Ok, I'm humoring you.

422
00:38:20.549 --> 00:38:21.362
Why?

423
00:38:21.912 --> 00:38:22.803
Who knows.

424
00:38:22.805 --> 00:38:24.623
Maybe just for the fun of it, no telling.

425
00:38:24.867 --> 00:38:25.801
So it's fun.

426
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:28.470
It's fun when a man
beats his wife to death,

427
00:38:28.817 --> 00:38:30.891
when a mother drowns her baby.

428
00:38:31.248 --> 00:38:32.332
And you think...

429
00:38:32.651 --> 00:38:34.476
the devil is responsible?

430
00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.397
People are evil, Mr. Constantine.

431
00:38:37.496 --> 00:38:38.063
People.

432
00:38:38.099 --> 00:38:38.933
You're right.

433
00:38:38.935 --> 00:38:41.323
We're born capable of terrible things.

434
00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.005
Then sometimes
something else comes along

435
00:38:44.007 --> 00:38:45.651
and gives us just the right nudge.

436
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.942
Well, this has been real educational but...

437
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:50.910
I don't believe in the devil.

438
00:38:51.061 --> 00:38:51.941
You should.

439
00:38:52.505 --> 00:38:53.758
He believes in you.

440
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:16.316
It's a power outage.

441
00:39:17.084 --> 00:39:18.199
Not likely.

442
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:23.373
What? We should go.

443
00:39:23.671 --> 00:39:24.498
Now.

444
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.541
What is that?

445
00:39:33.326 --> 00:39:34.556
Wings.

446
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:37.211
Maybe talons.

447
00:39:38.398 --> 00:39:39.505
You're kidding.

448
00:39:39.881 --> 00:39:40.964
Of what?

449
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.287
Something that's not supposed
to be here.

450
00:39:49.062 --> 00:39:50.671
That's really not going to help.

451
00:39:56.186 --> 00:39:57.203
Close your eyes.

452
00:39:57.641 --> 00:39:58.383
Why?

453
00:39:59.593 --> 00:40:00.494
Suit yourself.

454
00:40:22.947 --> 00:40:24.703
Demons stay in hell?

455
00:40:27.368 --> 00:40:28.637
Tell them that.

456
00:40:31.603 --> 00:40:32.673
Don't worry.

457
00:40:33.616 --> 00:40:35.426
Happens to everyone the first time.

458
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:38.039
It's the sulfur.

459
00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.544
Sulfur.

460
00:40:43.551 --> 00:40:44.943
What were those things?

461
00:40:47.245 --> 00:40:48.122
Demons.

462
00:40:50.699 --> 00:40:52.429
Scavengers of the damned.

463
00:40:52.431 --> 00:40:55.037
No, no. It's impossible.

464
00:40:55.342 --> 00:40:56.199
Yeah.

465
00:40:56.481 --> 00:40:58.718
And I don't think they were after me.

466
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:03.801
You really believe
she would not commit suicide.

467
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.470
Isabel?

468
00:41:06.754 --> 00:41:08.450
Never in a million years.

469
00:41:09.249 --> 00:41:10.655
Well, let's be sure.

470
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.040
Let's see if she's in hell.

471
00:41:38.442 --> 00:41:40.514
Oh, was it supposed to be hot or cold?

472
00:41:41.164 --> 00:41:42.532
In front of the chair.

473
00:41:46.048 --> 00:41:47.620
I can't believe I'm doing this.

474
00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:50.076
These are all Isabel's things?
Yeah.

475
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.765
How about the cat?
Duck?

476
00:41:54.581 --> 00:41:55.774
Yeah, why?

477
00:41:57.745 --> 00:41:58.403
Duck.

478
00:41:59.191 --> 00:42:00.809
Oh, you think that's strange.

479
00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:02.740
Cats are good.

480
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:04.735
Half in, half out anyway.

481
00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.060
If this is some kind of spell
or something,

482
00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.642
don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

483
00:42:29.837 --> 00:42:30.992
Why, do you have any?

484
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:33.815
This is crazy.

485
00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:34.655
Yes.

486
00:42:39.039 --> 00:42:40.467
I need you to leave.

487
00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.273
I'm sorry?

488
00:42:43.275 --> 00:42:44.711
Angela, please.

489
00:42:49.371 --> 00:42:50.632
The apartment.

490
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:54.297
Ok.

491
00:43:01.583 --> 00:43:03.320
Be careful with that cat.

492
00:43:08.346 --> 00:43:10.356
God, I hate this part.

493
00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:14.867
<i>Isabel.</i>

494
00:45:15.222 --> 00:45:16.425
<i>Constantine.</i>

495
00:46:02.382 --> 00:46:03.312
Angela.

496
00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.140
Jesus.

497
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:14.120
Constantine, what...
Twins.

498
00:46:14.626 --> 00:46:15.629
Jesus.

499
00:46:16.209 --> 00:46:16.901
What?

500
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:19.215
You were twins.
What did you say?

501
00:46:20.146 --> 00:46:21.677
She killed herself.
What?

502
00:46:24.045 --> 00:46:25.339
And she's damned for it.

503
00:46:39.557 --> 00:46:40.997
How is this possible?

504
00:46:43.916 --> 00:46:45.236
I need to eat.

505
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.552
Hey! Hey!

506
00:48:34.851 --> 00:48:36.368
What are you doing in here?

507
00:48:39.022 --> 00:48:40.124
Relax, man.

508
00:48:41.335 --> 00:48:42.465
Slow down!

509
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:09.070
What the hell kind of place is this?

510
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:01.450
<i>John.</i>

511
00:50:32.294 --> 00:50:33.452
When I was a kid,

512
00:50:33.945 --> 00:50:35.368
I could see things.

513
00:50:36.658 --> 00:50:38.479
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

514
00:50:40.301 --> 00:50:42.137
Things you should not have to see.

515
00:51:00.747 --> 00:51:02.214
My parents were normal.

516
00:51:02.672 --> 00:51:04.373
They did what most parents would do.

517
00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.000
They made it worse.

518
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.068
You think you're crazy long enough,

519
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:14.645
you find a way out.

520
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:16.695
You tried to kill yourself.

521
00:51:16.697 --> 00:51:18.288
I didn't try anything.

522
00:51:22.784 --> 00:51:25.150
Officially, I was dead for two minutes.

523
00:51:26.808 --> 00:51:28.366
But when you cross over,

524
00:51:30.292 --> 00:51:31.792
time stops.

525
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.798
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

526
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:40.390
When I came back...

527
00:51:43.143 --> 00:51:44.277
I knew...

528
00:51:45.342 --> 00:51:47.572
all the things I could see were real.

529
00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:51.226
Heaven and hell are right here.

530
00:51:51.603 --> 00:51:53.981
Behind every wall, every window.

531
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:56.394
The world behind the world,

532
00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:58.938
and we're smack in the middle.

533
00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:03.044
Angels and demons
can't cross over onto our plane.

534
00:52:03.489 --> 00:52:06.252
So instead we get what I call half-breeds.

535
00:52:07.596 --> 00:52:09.440
The influence peddlers.

536
00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.504
They can only whisper in our ears,

537
00:52:12.586 --> 00:52:15.165
but a single word
can give you courage

538
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:19.042
or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.

539
00:52:19.785 --> 00:52:22.027
Those with the demon's touch...

540
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.880
like those part angel,

541
00:52:25.759 --> 00:52:27.474
living alongside us.

542
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.058
They call it the balance.

543
00:52:31.198 --> 00:52:33.485
I call it hypocritical bullshit.

544
00:52:35.837 --> 00:52:38.319
So when a half-breed breaks the rules,

545
00:52:38.968 --> 00:52:41.943
I deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

546
00:52:43.555 --> 00:52:45.420
I don't get them all but...

547
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:49.727
I've been hoping to get enough
to ensure my...

548
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.748
retirement.

549
00:52:53.038 --> 00:52:54.371
I don't understand.

550
00:52:56.504 --> 00:52:58.194
I'm a suicide, Angela.

551
00:52:58.939 --> 00:53:02.130
When I die, the rules say
I've got just one place to go.

552
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:04.630
You're trying to buy your way into heaven.

553
00:53:04.871 --> 00:53:07.639
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison

554
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.866
where half the inmates
were put there by you?

555
00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.470
I guess God has a plan for all of us.

556
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.371
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

557
00:53:18.555 --> 00:53:20.085
He's not planning anything.

558
00:53:21.027 --> 00:53:22.295
When we were little...

559
00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:25.883
Isabel saw things too.

560
00:53:31.928 --> 00:53:32.888
Dodson.

561
00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:39.090
Guard spotted him groping the body,
then he ran across the street.

562
00:53:39.645 --> 00:53:41.978
Came in here and he had a go
at the entire stock.

563
00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:45.244
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

564
00:53:46.778 --> 00:53:48.608
Could've been a member of my fraternity.

565
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:53.420
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

566
00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.390
He's ok.

567
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.759
Why didn't you call me,
you son of a bitch?

568
00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:44.454
Yes?

569
00:54:46.075 --> 00:54:47.235
What do you mean?

570
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:49.714
What?

571
00:54:50.369 --> 00:54:51.218
How?

572
00:55:03.517 --> 00:55:04.410
Got it.

573
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:05.803
Bye.

574
00:55:13.153 --> 00:55:15.076
I need to see where Isabel died.

575
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.100
Séances, Ouija boards, channeling.

576
00:55:20.116 --> 00:55:22.778
Our father thought she was
just trying to get attention.

577
00:55:23.931 --> 00:55:25.582
She certainly did that.

578
00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:29.298
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

579
00:55:30.285 --> 00:55:32.967
She'd scare my mother, half to death.

580
00:55:35.838 --> 00:55:38.080
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

581
00:55:38.666 --> 00:55:40.287
So you had her committed.

582
00:55:41.025 --> 00:55:41.825
Yeah.

583
00:55:42.574 --> 00:55:43.480
How long?

584
00:55:44.629 --> 00:55:45.688
Two weeks.

585
00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:47.846
This time.

586
00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:50.575
She'd get better,
and then she'd get worse.

587
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:52.484
Recently, a lot worse.

588
00:55:55.319 --> 00:55:56.790
That symbol that was...

589
00:55:57.131 --> 00:55:58.627
cut in the dead guy's hand,

590
00:55:58.991 --> 00:56:00.634
does it have something
to do with this?

591
00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:03.015
I'm a cop, John,

592
00:56:03.131 --> 00:56:03.933
remember?

593
00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:08.810
You don't walk off the roof of a building
without leaving something behind.

594
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:11.984
And I showed you everything
she left behind in that box,

595
00:56:11.986 --> 00:56:12.743
but...

596
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:13.908
feel free.

597
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:15.900
Maybe she left something else.

598
00:56:16.794 --> 00:56:18.637
Not something a cop would find.

599
00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:22.730
Something just for you.

600
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.348
You were her twin, Angela.

601
00:56:26.925 --> 00:56:28.562
Twins tend to think alike.

602
00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:30.300
I'm not like my sister.

603
00:56:30.513 --> 00:56:31.872
But you were once.

604
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:34.008
When you were kids.

605
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:37.465
When you'd spend every second
with each other.

606
00:56:37.833 --> 00:56:39.885
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.

607
00:56:39.887 --> 00:56:41.389
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

608
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:43.055
That was a long time ago.

609
00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.373
That kind of bond doesn't just disappear.

610
00:56:45.375 --> 00:56:46.812
There is nothing here.

611
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:50.682
Hey. Come on.
She planned her death in this room.

612
00:56:51.263 --> 00:56:54.560
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

613
00:56:55.146 --> 00:56:58.366
She knew you'd come. She counted
on you to see what she saw,

614
00:56:58.381 --> 00:57:00.650
feel what she felt, know what she knew.

615
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:03.527
What did she do, Angela?

616
00:57:03.747 --> 00:57:04.752
How should I know?

617
00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:07.013
What did she do, Angela?
I don't know.

618
00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.421
What would you do?
I don't know.

619
00:57:10.463 --> 00:57:11.838
What would you do?
I don't know.

620
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:13.435
What did she do, Angela?
I don't know.

621
00:57:13.451 --> 00:57:14.939
You know what she did.
I don't know.

622
00:57:14.941 --> 00:57:16.757
What did she do, Angela?
I don't know.

623
00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.946
You know what she did.
What are you afraid of?

624
00:57:19.174 --> 00:57:20.322
What did she do Angela?

625
00:57:20.324 --> 00:57:22.463
What did she do?
I don't know!

626
00:57:40.232 --> 00:57:41.735
When we were girls...

627
00:57:45.418 --> 00:57:47.414
we would leave each other messages.

628
00:57:50.903 --> 00:57:52.263
In light.

629
00:57:55.373 --> 00:57:56.663
In breath.

630
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.760
On the windows.

631
00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.055
John, there is no 17th act in Corinthians.

632
00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.605
Corinthians goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

633
00:58:18.143 --> 00:58:19.550
They have Bibles in hell.

634
00:58:20.537 --> 00:58:22.625
Paints a different view of Revelations.

635
00:58:23.209 --> 00:58:25.430
Says the world will not end by God's hand,

636
00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:27.763
but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.

637
00:58:28.608 --> 00:58:29.862
Though if you ask me,

638
00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.021
fire's fire.

639
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:36.197
<i>16:29, 16:30.</i>

640
00:58:37.414 --> 00:58:38.437
Oh my...

641
00:58:38.923 --> 00:58:40.521
this is certainly not good.

642
00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:45.309
The sins of the father would only
be exceeded by the sins of the son.

643
00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.003
Whose son?

644
00:58:47.262 --> 00:58:48.917
But he can't cross over, B.

645
00:58:49.758 --> 00:58:52.340
Impossible to cross over.
Whose son? God's son?

646
00:58:52.431 --> 00:58:53.528
No, the other one.

647
00:58:54.206 --> 00:58:55.722
Devil had a son too.

648
00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:57.253
Here it is.

649
00:58:57.923 --> 00:58:59.538
This is the sign of Mammon,

650
00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:01.654
the son of the devil.

651
00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.993
Well, hold on, it says here...

652
00:59:05.011 --> 00:59:05.811
<i>Beeman?</i>

653
00:59:06.328 --> 00:59:07.257
Yeah.

654
00:59:07.551 --> 00:59:09.743
Sorry, I'm...
I'm sorry, no, I'm right here.

655
00:59:11.371 --> 00:59:12.635
It says...

656
00:59:12.996 --> 00:59:15.084
Mammon has no patience...

657
00:59:15.448 --> 00:59:16.787
for his father's rule,

658
00:59:17.274 --> 00:59:20.166
and yearns to forge his own kingdom,

659
00:59:20.659 --> 00:59:22.618
of fire and blood.

660
00:59:28.218 --> 00:59:29.133
Yeah.

661
00:59:29.255 --> 00:59:33.610
Mammon, would be the last demon
we'd ever want crossing over to our plane.

662
00:59:33.942 --> 00:59:36.058
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm reading.

663
00:59:36.575 --> 00:59:37.743
Seems to be a loophole.

664
00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:39.231
Always a catch.

665
00:59:40.433 --> 00:59:41.514
It says first,

666
00:59:41.761 --> 00:59:42.774
Mammon,

667
00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:45.367
would have to possess a very, very,

668
00:59:45.486 --> 00:59:46.632
powerful psychic.

669
00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:47.854
Isabel.

670
00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.706
<i>But that would not be enough.</i>

671
00:59:50.306 --> 00:59:51.400
To cross over,

672
00:59:51.402 --> 00:59:52.824
Mammon would need...

673
00:59:53.093 --> 00:59:54.699
divine assistance.

674
00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:57.115
To cross over,

675
00:59:57.835 --> 01:00:00.263
Mammon would need the help of God.

676
01:00:01.341 --> 01:00:02.660
The help of God?

677
01:00:03.662 --> 01:00:04.372
<i>It says...</i>

678
01:00:10.195 --> 01:00:10.906
Who?

679
01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.138
<i>Beeman?</i>

680
01:00:12.374 --> 01:00:13.867
John, look...

681
01:00:14.628 --> 01:00:16.776
I know you've never had much faith,

682
01:00:16.778 --> 01:00:18.688
you've never had much reason to,

683
01:00:19.294 --> 01:00:22.196
<i>but that doesn't mean
that we don't have faith...</i>

684
01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.090
in you.

685
01:00:28.855 --> 01:00:29.884
Beeman?

686
01:00:30.711 --> 01:00:31.695
Beeman?

687
01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.021
Drive. Fast.

688
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:51.902
Beeman!

689
01:00:53.192 --> 01:00:54.392
Sulfur.

690
01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:57.263
Beeman!

691
01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:03.324
Beeman!

692
01:02:13.912 --> 01:02:15.211
Wasn't just Isabel.

693
01:02:17.387 --> 01:02:18.796
I used to see things too.

694
01:02:20.966 --> 01:02:21.782
But...

695
01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.827
you already knew that, didn't you?

696
01:02:25.093 --> 01:02:26.356
Go home, Angela.

697
01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.116
I need to understand.

698
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:30.732
You don't wanna know
what's out there, trust me.

699
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.029
I'm stronger than Isabel.

700
01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:35.069
Your sister embraced her gift,

701
01:02:35.071 --> 01:02:37.485
you denied yours.
Denial is a better idea.

702
01:02:37.553 --> 01:02:39.880
It's why you're still alive.
Stick with me...

703
01:02:40.828 --> 01:02:41.981
that will change.

704
01:02:42.564 --> 01:02:44.475
I don't need another
ghost following me around.

705
01:02:44.477 --> 01:02:46.287
John, they killed my sister.

706
01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.510
I'd trade places with her if I could.

707
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:59.436
I used to pretend that I didn't.

708
01:03:00.483 --> 01:03:01.934
That I didn't see things.

709
01:03:03.159 --> 01:03:03.903
And...

710
01:03:05.977 --> 01:03:09.339
by the time we were 10,
they started forcing her to take,

711
01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.408
antipsychotics and...

712
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:16.493
treatments and they would come for her

713
01:03:16.495 --> 01:03:18.109
and she'd look at me,
and she'd say to me.

714
01:03:18.791 --> 01:03:19.698
Tell them.

715
01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:23.914
Why don't you tell them, Angie,
that you can see them too?

716
01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:26.490
But I lied.

717
01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:28.835
I said.

718
01:03:31.286 --> 01:03:32.786
I don't see anything.

719
01:03:34.576 --> 01:03:35.869
Until one day...

720
01:03:37.738 --> 01:03:39.303
I finally stopped seeing.

721
01:03:41.868 --> 01:03:43.316
I abandoned her, John.

722
01:03:45.138 --> 01:03:46.627
I left her all alone.

723
01:03:54.785 --> 01:03:56.426
I need to see what she saw.

724
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.107
Please.

725
01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:07.641
You do this, there is no turning back.

726
01:04:10.766 --> 01:04:11.999
You see them,

727
01:04:13.651 --> 01:04:14.788
they see you.

728
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.511
Understand?

729
01:04:19.285 --> 01:04:20.269
Yeah.

730
01:04:27.054 --> 01:04:27.813
Sure.

731
01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.892
So do I have to take
the rest of my clothes off,

732
01:05:09.894 --> 01:05:11.263
or can I leave them on?

733
01:05:18.335 --> 01:05:19.264
John?

734
01:05:20.321 --> 01:05:21.485
I'm thinking.

735
01:05:26.229 --> 01:05:27.009
John?

736
01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.532
On is fine.

737
01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.823
So why water?

738
01:05:45.206 --> 01:05:46.737
It's a universal conduit.

739
01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.977
Lubricates the transition
from one plane to another.

740
01:05:51.097 --> 01:05:53.018
Now ask me if there is water in hell.

741
01:05:53.248 --> 01:05:54.590
Is there water in hell?

742
01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:57.925
Sit.

743
01:05:59.991 --> 01:06:03.134
Normally only a portion of the body
has to be suspended but,

744
01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.619
you wanted the crash course.

745
01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:10.970
Yeah, I wanted the crash course.

746
01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.070
So...

747
01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:15.850
So what's gonna happen?

748
01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.758
Lie down.

749
01:06:18.690 --> 01:06:20.217
What do you mean lie down?

750
01:06:20.437 --> 01:06:22.182
You have to be fully submerged.

751
01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:25.560
For how long?

752
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.030
As long as it takes.

753
01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.876
Take a deep one.

754
01:08:23.045 --> 01:08:24.076
Oh, God.

755
01:08:25.839 --> 01:08:27.860
Oh, God, all those people.

756
01:08:29.816 --> 01:08:31.171
Oh, Isabel.

757
01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:33.834
I've always known.

758
01:08:34.495 --> 01:08:36.107
I've always known where they are.

759
01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:37.311
I've always known where...

760
01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.173
where to find them, where...

761
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.012
where to aim and where...

762
01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:43.776
to duck and I've always
known where they were.

763
01:08:43.778 --> 01:08:45.470
I've always known that it wasn't luck.

764
01:08:46.058 --> 01:08:47.823
I've always known that it wasn't luck.

765
01:08:47.825 --> 01:08:49.663
I've always known that I've always...

766
01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:51.392
known that I could...

767
01:08:51.685 --> 01:08:53.409
see I've always...

768
01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.327
known that I could see.

769
01:09:02.595 --> 01:09:03.492
Angela.

770
01:09:08.273 --> 01:09:09.680
Someone was here.

771
01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.140
It was his.

772
01:09:39.732 --> 01:09:40.789
Rolling.

773
01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.830
Not a ball.

774
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.085
Something smaller.

775
01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.360
Shiny.

776
01:10:26.599 --> 01:10:28.025
Balthazar.

777
01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:02.114
Sorry.

778
01:11:09.931 --> 01:11:11.210
Can you just kill him?

779
01:11:13.016 --> 01:11:14.098
What about the balance?

780
01:11:14.477 --> 01:11:17.514
Half-breed tipped the scales
when he started killing my friends.

781
01:11:18.318 --> 01:11:20.116
I'm just adding some counterweight.

782
01:11:54.617 --> 01:11:56.019
John, I really want...

783
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.231
Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

784
01:12:13.638 --> 01:12:14.732
I'm coming with you.

785
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:18.517
You're staying in the car.

786
01:12:43.806 --> 01:12:46.677
Fire?
I was born of this.

787
01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.168
How's Mammon crossing over,

788
01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:51.419
you half-breed piece of shit?

789
01:12:55.433 --> 01:12:56.766
That's better.

790
01:12:56.963 --> 01:12:58.359
Au naturel.

791
01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.890
Stay in the car.

792
01:13:08.497 --> 01:13:09.781
Wait here.

793
01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:12.460
Men.

794
01:13:26.564 --> 01:13:27.988
Don't fight it, Johnny boy.

795
01:13:29.649 --> 01:13:30.932
Enjoy it.

796
01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:07.653
We'll see you very soon.

797
01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:10.641
Not really, no.

798
01:14:11.296 --> 01:14:13.467
You can't cheat it this time.

799
01:14:13.961 --> 01:14:16.458
You're going back to hell.

800
01:14:16.573 --> 01:14:17.603
True.

801
01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.441
But you're not.

802
01:14:20.851 --> 01:14:22.082
What are you doing?

803
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:23.909
I'm reading you your last rites.

804
01:14:24.136 --> 01:14:27.968
Spare me your remedial incantations.

805
01:14:28.022 --> 01:14:30.368
You do know what it is
to truly be forgiven?

806
01:14:30.486 --> 01:14:33.073
To be welcomed into the Kingdom of God.

807
01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.310
Demon in heaven.

808
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:39.393
I'd love to be a fly on that wall.

809
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:40.780
You're not a priest.

810
01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:43.806
You have no power.

811
01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:49.451
Just tell me how Mammon is crossing over
and you can go back to your shithole.

812
01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.244
Ok, Bally.

813
01:14:55.558 --> 01:14:56.653
Enjoy it.

814
01:15:06.761 --> 01:15:08.687
May God have mercy on you,

815
01:15:09.217 --> 01:15:11.581
and grant you the pardon
of all your sins.

816
01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.546
Whose soever sins you remit on Earth,

817
01:15:14.548 --> 01:15:16.613
they are remitted unto them in heaven.

818
01:15:18.846 --> 01:15:20.241
How? How's he doing it?

819
01:15:20.454 --> 01:15:21.240
No.

820
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:22.941
No, I can't.

821
01:15:24.781 --> 01:15:28.196
Grant your child entry into thy kingdom,

822
01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:30.602
in the name of the Father

823
01:15:30.604 --> 01:15:33.669
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

824
01:15:34.312 --> 01:15:37.023
Amen!
Sanguis Deos!

825
01:15:38.872 --> 01:15:41.066
The blood of God.

826
01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.667
He found it, man.

827
01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.236
Whatever killed,

828
01:15:45.448 --> 01:15:47.891
the son of God,

829
01:15:48.203 --> 01:15:49.434
will give birth,

830
01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:52.835
to the son of the devil.

831
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.993
By the way,

832
01:15:59.705 --> 01:16:02.845
you have to ask for absolution
to be forgiven...

833
01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:05.470
asshole.

834
01:16:09.762 --> 01:16:11.050
My work here,

835
01:16:11.419 --> 01:16:12.421
is done.

836
01:16:14.666 --> 01:16:15.745
What are you laughing at?

837
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:18.898
She was my only mission,

838
01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.562
and you brought her right...

839
01:16:22.297 --> 01:16:23.319
to us.

840
01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:29.375
So does this walking fast
mean you've found something?

841
01:16:30.304 --> 01:16:32.493
Jesus didn't die
from being nailed to a cross.

842
01:16:32.557 --> 01:16:34.354
He was killed by a soldier's spear.

843
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:36.056
The Spear of Destiny.

844
01:16:37.325 --> 01:16:39.887
I'm a Catholic, John.
I know the Crucifixion story.

845
01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:49.563
I...

846
01:16:50.043 --> 01:16:51.525
drew out the sister,

847
01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.034
as you asked.

848
01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:55.138
She's been made,

849
01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:58.491
flush and ready.

850
01:16:59.712 --> 01:17:02.587
So much power.

851
01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:04.743
Now,

852
01:17:05.073 --> 01:17:07.208
if you grant me my resurrection,

853
01:17:07.733 --> 01:17:08.936
I shall serve.

854
01:17:11.373 --> 01:17:12.189
Wait!

855
01:17:12.302 --> 01:17:14.235
But I did as we agreed.

856
01:17:15.201 --> 01:17:16.093
No.

857
01:17:16.677 --> 01:17:17.676
Please.

858
01:17:17.701 --> 01:17:18.535
No!

859
01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:25.541
Beeman said Mammon needed
divine assistance to cross over.

860
01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.316
How's the blood of God's only son?

861
01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:33.020
The stains on the spear.

862
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.099
Yeah.

863
01:17:36.312 --> 01:17:37.922
So he gets the spear.

864
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:40.300
He still has to locate a powerful psychic.

865
01:17:41.551 --> 01:17:42.541
Not really.

866
01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:47.170
Twins.

867
01:17:49.447 --> 01:17:50.607
Where's the amulet?

868
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.413
I don't know, I must have left it in the...

869
01:17:57.194 --> 01:17:58.080
What's wrong?

870
01:17:59.079 --> 01:18:00.570
I don't know, I just feel...

871
01:18:07.728 --> 01:18:08.455
Fuck!

872
01:18:32.687 --> 01:18:34.053
Bird on a ladder.
Sorry.

873
01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:41.690
Wait here.
Yeah.

874
01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.213
Who's a rat in a dress now, bitch?

875
01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:04.890
Have you lost what little mind you have?

876
01:19:05.112 --> 01:19:06.011
Don't.

877
01:19:07.318 --> 01:19:09.299
I need to use the chair.

878
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:13.950
I offer no aid to one side or the other.

879
01:19:15.381 --> 01:19:16.459
The balance.

880
01:19:16.529 --> 01:19:18.157
Screw the balance.

881
01:19:24.536 --> 01:19:27.048
You dare? In my house?

882
01:19:29.568 --> 01:19:31.030
Is this neutral?

883
01:19:31.414 --> 01:19:32.863
Bullshit.

884
01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.729
You're the only one still playing
by the rules, Midnite.

885
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:38.880
And while you've been imitating
Switzerland, people are dying.

886
01:19:40.387 --> 01:19:42.109
Hennessy, Beeman,

887
01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:44.291
they were your friends
once too, remember?

888
01:19:45.558 --> 01:19:47.425
I need your help!

889
01:19:50.530 --> 01:19:52.590
Consider it a last request.

890
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:58.674
You play a dangerous game.

891
01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:08.862
Two-hundred-dollar shirt by the way.

892
01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:14.931
That little shit has been trying to climb
out of his father's shadow for eons.

893
01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.852
I'd hate to think what
he would do to this world,

894
01:20:18.129 --> 01:20:19.702
if he ever broke through.

895
01:20:23.612 --> 01:20:25.057
Forgot how big it was.

896
01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:30.053
Two hundred souls passed through
this wood and steel at Sing Sing.

897
01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:32.049
Yeah.

898
01:20:35.886 --> 01:20:37.129
Which way's east?

899
01:20:55.727 --> 01:20:57.474
How many years since you've surfed?

900
01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:01.340
Like riding a bike.

901
01:21:01.906 --> 01:21:03.196
No, not really.

902
01:21:06.592 --> 01:21:09.379
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

903
01:21:10.684 --> 01:21:14.339
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

904
01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.360
Cold.

905
01:21:22.959 --> 01:21:24.195
Little flavor?

906
01:21:48.393 --> 01:21:49.503
Sure about this?
No.

907
01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:41.900
Midnite!

908
01:22:47.946 --> 01:22:48.943
Any luck?

909
01:22:49.389 --> 01:22:50.990
That's a word for it.

910
01:22:51.334 --> 01:22:52.541
Holy shit.

911
01:22:53.227 --> 01:22:54.666
You're Papa Midnite, aren't you?

912
01:23:02.674 --> 01:23:05.759
And how exactly do you intend
on getting close enough to use these?

913
01:23:09.019 --> 01:23:09.816
Well,

914
01:23:10.131 --> 01:23:11.830
they did not leave her unguarded.

915
01:23:12.404 --> 01:23:14.277
Half-breeds are most
vulnerable when, their...

916
01:23:14.944 --> 01:23:16.985
outer skin is breached by holy water.

917
01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:19.696
Certain objects,

918
01:23:20.281 --> 01:23:22.496
most notably either
of the two crosses of Isteria,

919
01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:26.036
have been used by even the unordained
to bless commonly occurring waters,

920
01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.779
even rain.

921
01:23:29.242 --> 01:23:30.102
Maybe if...

922
01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.497
There's no use sitting on the bench
if you're not ready to play, right?

923
01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.675
So you would not have one of those
enchanted crosses here in a cabinet,

924
01:23:42.677 --> 01:23:44.113
or something maybe
we could take with us?

925
01:23:45.105 --> 01:23:46.470
Look John, no offense,

926
01:23:46.472 --> 01:23:49.745
I just don't think
it's a great idea you know,

927
01:23:49.781 --> 01:23:51.358
you going on a solo mission
to save the world.

928
01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.272
That's, that's where I place my vote.

929
01:23:53.314 --> 01:23:54.918
I don't know what pops thinks but that's...

930
01:23:57.293 --> 01:23:58.320
Take him, John.

931
01:23:59.009 --> 01:24:00.189
Kill him after.

932
01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:06.662
If you get back,

933
01:24:07.023 --> 01:24:08.556
see me about membership.

934
01:24:09.036 --> 01:24:09.907
Maybe.

935
01:24:09.972 --> 01:24:10.472
Ok.

936
01:24:10.919 --> 01:24:11.814
I will.

937
01:24:17.501 --> 01:24:18.462
What are you doing?

938
01:24:18.784 --> 01:24:19.800
Praying.

939
01:24:20.052 --> 01:24:20.822
Praying.

940
01:24:21.464 --> 01:24:22.165
Ok.

941
01:24:23.907 --> 01:24:24.955
Come on.

942
01:25:22.602 --> 01:25:23.602
Half-breeds, right?

943
01:25:27.044 --> 01:25:29.588
A birth like this, they're
definitely gonna be guarding her,

944
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:30.735
right? Definitely.

945
01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:32.935
Yeah.

946
01:25:36.485 --> 01:25:37.616
We can get through them.

947
01:25:38.404 --> 01:25:40.476
I mean, that cross has got
to work, right?

948
01:25:41.392 --> 01:25:42.091
Right?

949
01:25:43.194 --> 01:25:45.569
It's not always like it is in the books.

950
01:26:34.749 --> 01:26:35.846
What is that?

951
01:26:37.145 --> 01:26:38.397
Hellspeak.

952
01:26:41.697 --> 01:26:43.096
You know what to do.

953
01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:47.724
Ok.

954
01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.466
Sure.

955
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:05.968
One last show.

956
01:27:40.563 --> 01:27:41.438
Hi.

957
01:27:43.081 --> 01:27:44.159
My name's John.

958
01:27:46.608 --> 01:27:49.085
You are in violation of the balance.

959
01:27:50.908 --> 01:27:52.452
Leave immediately...

960
01:27:53.618 --> 01:27:55.293
or I will deport you.

961
01:27:58.085 --> 01:27:59.186
All of you.

962
01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:08.615
Go to hell.

963
01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.070
Holy water?

964
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:35.819
Angela.

965
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:09.454
John?

966
01:30:12.687 --> 01:30:13.417
John.

967
01:30:19.711 --> 01:30:20.652
Shit.

968
01:30:46.690 --> 01:30:47.590
Pull!

969
01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:30.105
Angela.

970
01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:55.103
Angela, what is it?

971
01:32:02.473 --> 01:32:03.516
Get it out.

972
01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:19.500
Get it out.

973
01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:21.390
Get it...

974
01:33:06.687 --> 01:33:07.420
Oh, my God.

975
01:33:15.099 --> 01:33:16.189
Not bad, kid.

976
01:33:19.670 --> 01:33:20.975
Not bad. You hear that?

977
01:33:21.812 --> 01:33:23.145
You know why that is?
It's because

978
01:33:23.382 --> 01:33:24.593
this is Kramer.

979
01:33:24.853 --> 01:33:25.890
Chas Kramer, ass...

980
01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:35.186
Chas.

981
01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:45.739
You're right, John.

982
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.404
It's not like the books.

983
01:33:50.761 --> 01:33:51.385
No...

984
01:33:53.332 --> 01:33:54.228
it isn't.

985
01:34:16.105 --> 01:34:17.965
Into the light, I command thee.

986
01:34:19.921 --> 01:34:22.717
Into the light, I command thee.

987
01:34:24.553 --> 01:34:27.132
Into the light, I command thee.

988
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:35.818
Into the light, I command thee.

989
01:34:40.039 --> 01:34:42.065
Your ego is astounding.

990
01:34:43.102 --> 01:34:44.222
Gabriel.

991
01:34:45.330 --> 01:34:46.289
Figures.

992
01:34:47.596 --> 01:34:50.658
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

993
01:34:51.119 --> 01:34:52.611
You judging me now, John?

994
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.738
Betrayal, murder, genocide,

995
01:34:57.738 --> 01:34:59.055
call me provincial.

996
01:34:59.170 --> 01:35:01.702
I am simply seeking to inspire mankind

997
01:35:01.752 --> 01:35:02.823
to all that was intended.

998
01:35:03.436 --> 01:35:06.017
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

999
01:35:07.781 --> 01:35:08.953
Help me here.

1000
01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:14.562
You're handed this...

1001
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:17.329
precious gift, right?

1002
01:35:18.749 --> 01:35:19.859
Each one of you...

1003
01:35:20.303 --> 01:35:22.351
granted redemption from the Creator.

1004
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:25.890
Murderers, rapists and molesters,

1005
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:28.513
all of you, you just have to repent

1006
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:30.931
and God takes you into his bosom.

1007
01:35:34.073 --> 01:35:36.250
In all the worlds in all the universe,

1008
01:35:36.461 --> 01:35:39.080
no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

1009
01:35:42.046 --> 01:35:42.953
It's not fair.

1010
01:35:47.482 --> 01:35:50.168
If sweet, sweet God loves you so,

1011
01:35:51.487 --> 01:35:54.017
then I'll make you worthy of his love.

1012
01:35:56.289 --> 01:35:58.418
I've been watching you for a long time.

1013
01:35:59.630 --> 01:36:01.350
It's only in the face of horror,

1014
01:36:01.609 --> 01:36:03.918
that you truly find your nobler selves.

1015
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:07.040
And you can be so noble.

1016
01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:11.820
So...

1017
01:36:13.123 --> 01:36:14.472
I'll bring you pain.

1018
01:36:16.194 --> 01:36:17.704
I'll bring you horror.

1019
01:36:20.265 --> 01:36:22.312
So that you may rise above it.

1020
01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:29.996
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth

1021
01:36:30.796 --> 01:36:33.113
will be worthy of God's love.

1022
01:36:33.936 --> 01:36:35.105
Gabriel...

1023
01:36:36.370 --> 01:36:38.140
you're insane.

1024
01:36:40.328 --> 01:36:43.058
The road to salvation begins tonight.

1025
01:36:44.269 --> 01:36:45.499
Right now.

1026
01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:30.220
I know I'm not one of your favorites.

1027
01:37:32.490 --> 01:37:34.449
I'm not even welcome in your house.

1028
01:37:36.665 --> 01:37:38.995
But I could use a little attention.

1029
01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:43.860
Please.

1030
01:38:30.925 --> 01:38:32.400
Come forth.

1031
01:38:53.170 --> 01:38:54.570
Hurry.

1032
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:13.410
Mammon,

1033
01:39:14.174 --> 01:39:15.924
son of Satan,

1034
01:39:16.787 --> 01:39:20.323
I unleash you unto this world.

1035
01:40:15.190 --> 01:40:16.020
Lu.

1036
01:40:16.690 --> 01:40:18.280
What took you so long?

1037
01:40:18.874 --> 01:40:20.204
Hello, John.

1038
01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.928
John, hello.

1039
01:40:29.999 --> 01:40:32.016
You're the one soul

1040
01:40:33.353 --> 01:40:35.809
I would come up here to collect myself.

1041
01:40:40.254 --> 01:40:41.585
So I've heard.

1042
01:40:43.650 --> 01:40:44.569
You mind?

1043
01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:48.120
Oh, go... Go right ahead.
I've got stock.

1044
01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:50.220
Coffin nail.

1045
01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:52.590
Very fitting, John.

1046
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.659
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons...

1047
01:40:59.629 --> 01:41:01.649
finger movement goes out the window.

1048
01:41:02.544 --> 01:41:03.751
Let me help you.

1049
01:41:16.026 --> 01:41:16.963
See?

1050
01:41:19.377 --> 01:41:20.277
Sonny...

1051
01:41:21.042 --> 01:41:23.009
I've got a whole...

1052
01:41:23.238 --> 01:41:25.781
theme park full of red delights for you.

1053
01:41:26.912 --> 01:41:28.345
Well, aren't you a peach.

1054
01:41:30.213 --> 01:41:33.393
I didn't think you would
make the same mistake twice.

1055
01:41:38.892 --> 01:41:39.944
And you didn't,

1056
01:41:41.654 --> 01:41:42.884
did you?

1057
01:41:43.607 --> 01:41:45.037
So how's the family?

1058
01:41:45.444 --> 01:41:47.310
Family's doing just fine.

1059
01:41:47.436 --> 01:41:48.964
Busy, busy, busy, busy.

1060
01:41:49.333 --> 01:41:50.784
Need a vacation.

1061
01:41:51.890 --> 01:41:55.274
Word is that kid of yours
is a chip off the old block.

1062
01:41:55.427 --> 01:41:56.071
Well,

1063
01:41:56.073 --> 01:41:57.948
one does what one can.

1064
01:41:58.713 --> 01:42:00.143
He's in the other room.

1065
01:42:00.325 --> 01:42:02.595
Boys will be boys.

1066
01:42:04.391 --> 01:42:05.531
With Gabriel.

1067
01:42:08.576 --> 01:42:10.836
No accounting for taste, really.

1068
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:13.917
They have the Spear of Destiny.

1069
01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.763
They have the Spear of Destiny.

1070
01:42:29.090 --> 01:42:31.256
Or is it another one of your cons?

1071
01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.730
Go look for yourself.

1072
01:42:39.606 --> 01:42:42.206
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu...

1073
01:42:43.551 --> 01:42:45.590
what's another 20 seconds?

1074
01:43:51.353 --> 01:43:52.207
Lucifer.

1075
01:43:52.718 --> 01:43:56.225
This world is mine in time.

1076
01:43:56.707 --> 01:44:00.994
You, best of all of us Gabriel
should understand.

1077
01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:04.201
Ambition.

1078
01:44:04.832 --> 01:44:06.356
Son of perdition.

1079
01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:09.678
Little horn.

1080
01:44:11.657 --> 01:44:13.156
Most unclean.

1081
01:44:14.082 --> 01:44:16.212
I do miss the old names.

1082
01:44:17.583 --> 01:44:19.536
Time to go home, son.

1083
01:44:19.842 --> 01:44:21.602
I will smite thee...

1084
01:44:22.612 --> 01:44:25.140
in his honor.

1085
01:44:30.725 --> 01:44:35.355
Looks like somebody doesn't
have your back anymore.

1086
01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:54.400
Father?

1087
01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:19.860
So.

1088
01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:28.481
So.

1089
01:45:28.982 --> 01:45:30.715
Yeah, what do you want?

1090
01:45:31.138 --> 01:45:32.634
An extension?

1091
01:45:37.610 --> 01:45:38.806
The sister...

1092
01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:41.562
Isabel.

1093
01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:45.292
What about her?

1094
01:45:47.494 --> 01:45:49.212
Let her go home.

1095
01:45:52.704 --> 01:45:56.764
You're willing to give up your life
so she can go to heaven?

1096
01:46:07.210 --> 01:46:08.138
Fine.

1097
01:46:08.194 --> 01:46:09.444
It's done.

1098
01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.170
Time to go,

1099
01:46:14.827 --> 01:46:15.841
John.

1100
01:46:16.609 --> 01:46:17.483
Yeah.

1101
01:47:15.925 --> 01:47:18.202
The sacrifice.

1102
01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:30.573
No.

1103
01:47:31.136 --> 01:47:34.628
This one belongs to me.

1104
01:47:45.562 --> 01:47:48.029
No. You will live,

1105
01:47:48.813 --> 01:47:51.362
John Constantine.

1106
01:47:54.650 --> 01:47:55.960
You will live.

1107
01:47:58.650 --> 01:48:00.371
So you will have...

1108
01:48:02.767 --> 01:48:04.707
the chance to prove...

1109
01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:12.493
that your soul truly belongs in hell.

1110
01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.573
Oh, you will live.

1111
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:26.717
You will live.

1112
01:49:41.590 --> 01:49:42.553
Thank you.

1113
01:49:45.849 --> 01:49:46.890
No problem.

1114
01:50:03.822 --> 01:50:04.884
Human.

1115
01:50:07.571 --> 01:50:10.163
You don't deserve to be human.

1116
01:50:11.588 --> 01:50:12.909
Do you want revenge?

1117
01:50:13.527 --> 01:50:15.241
Is that what you're thinking right now?

1118
01:50:18.867 --> 01:50:19.833
Do it.

1119
01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:22.820
Do it.

1120
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:26.060
Seek revenge.

1121
01:50:27.129 --> 01:50:28.560
End my life.

1122
01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:31.260
Go on.

1123
01:50:33.771 --> 01:50:35.185
Be the hand of God.

1124
01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:36.660
It's your choice.

1125
01:50:37.766 --> 01:50:39.269
It's always been your choice.

1126
01:50:45.564 --> 01:50:46.504
Yeah.

1127
01:50:52.730 --> 01:50:54.255
That's called pain.

1128
01:50:55.151 --> 01:50:56.425
Get used to it.

1129
01:51:02.925 --> 01:51:04.972
You could've shot me, John!

1130
01:51:07.252 --> 01:51:09.168
You chose a higher path!

1131
01:51:11.554 --> 01:51:13.395
Look how well you're doing!

1132
01:51:39.854 --> 01:51:41.100
Nice spot.

1133
01:51:46.147 --> 01:51:47.740
I have something for you.

1134
01:51:50.667 --> 01:51:53.226
Something tells me
you're not a flowers kind of guy.

1135
01:51:56.458 --> 01:51:58.485
Oh, how thoughtful.

1136
01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:05.234
John.

1137
01:52:07.707 --> 01:52:09.204
Why are you giving me this?

1138
01:52:10.131 --> 01:52:11.091
Rules.

1139
01:52:12.010 --> 01:52:13.000
Hide it.

1140
01:52:13.513 --> 01:52:15.807
Somewhere no one
will ever be able to find it.

1141
01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:18.910
Not even me.

1142
01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:24.880
Always a catch.

1143
01:52:26.850 --> 01:52:27.910
Yeah.

1144
01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:42.488
So.

1145
01:52:44.857 --> 01:52:47.178
I've got some cleaning up to do.

1146
01:52:51.615 --> 01:52:52.793
I'll...

1147
01:52:53.908 --> 01:52:55.188
see you around.

1148
01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:00.075
I'd like that.
