1
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.399
Manuel.

2
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.439
Manuel!

3
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.718
Manuel.

4
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.951
I think...

5
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.154
I think I found you one.

6
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.470
Look, I called you, right?

7
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.593
Soon as I couldn't pull it out myself,
I called you, John.

8
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.868
It's okay, it's okay.
We had to tie her down, okay?

9
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.838
It's okay.

10
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.434
This is Constantine.

11
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.515
John Constantine, asshole.

12
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.631
Sure.

13
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.832
What the hell?

14
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.034
I need a mirror.

15
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.192
Now. At least 3 feet high.

16
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.920
Move! Go, now!

17
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.157
This is Kramer.

18
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.553
Chas Kramer, asshole.

19
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.358
Asshole.

20
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.514
What? Oh, this is Kramer.
Chas Kramer, asshole.

21
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.716
- Chas!
- What?

22
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.519
- Move the car.
- Why?

23
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.356
Move the damn car!

24
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.599
"Chas, move the car".

25
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.994
There, car's moved.

26
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.591
Lift it up over the bed.

27
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.433
Tie that end off.
Hennessy, over the top.

28
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.840
Close your eyes.
And whatever happens, don't look.

29
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.311
No!

30
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.355
Show yourself.

31
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.236
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

32
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.670
For your boss.

33
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.679
Pull it!

34
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.911
Ma? Ma?

35
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.633
Like I said, I found you something,
didn't I, John? Didn't I?

36
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.398
What happened in there?

37
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.676
Going to a lot of meetings, I see.

38
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.876
Keeps the voices out so I can sleep.

39
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.356
I have to sleep, John.

40
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.434
I need some help, father.

41
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.639
You do?

42
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.479
From me?

43
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.278
What kind of...

44
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.433
- Hey, listen, I...
- That exorcism wasn't right.

45
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.072
Listen to the ether.

46
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.476
Anything unusual, you let me know.

47
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.790
Come on, you don't need its protection.
It'll be like back in the day.

48
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.951
A few days.

49
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.394
Okay.

50
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.836
Okay. For you, John.

51
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.510
John, why would you do that
if you know it's not my car?

52
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.154
- I told you to move it.
- Right John, you did tell me to move it

53
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.676
but if you'd have told me there's 300-pound mirror
you were dropping with a pised-off demon

54
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.592
I would've moved it further, John.

55
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.907
Take Alvarado.

56
00:10:21.933 --> 00:10:24.495
Yeah John, thank you.
I know what to take.

57
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.109
You ever think if you told me more now
that maybe I could help out?

58
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.554
- No?
- Nope.

59
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.994
Nope?

60
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.151
Of course it's a nope.

61
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.238
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

62
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.278
<i>It's been...</i>

63
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.318
<i>two weeks since my last confession.</i>

64
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.635
I killed a man today.

65
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.312
Another one.

66
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.350
I didn't even see his face, I just

67
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.629
pulled the trigger, and he went away.

68
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:47.716
<i>Most cops go 20 years
without firing their guns.</i>

69
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.754
<i>Why do I always know
where these guys are?</i>

70
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.117
<i>Where to aim, when to fire.</i>

71
00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.513
<i>I'm wondering, is there
something wrong with me, father?</i>

72
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.232
<i>Something damned?</i>

73
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.520
<i>God has a plan for you.
He has a plan for us all.</i>

74
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.913
<i>You mustn't let your faith
be overshadowed by guilt.</i>

75
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.036
<i>Yeah, I'm trying.</i>

76
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.149
<i>I'm trying real hard.</i>

77
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.954
<i>Isabel.</i>

78
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.996
<i>Isabel.</i>

79
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.510
Things I've beaten.

80
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.236
Things most people
never even heard of.

81
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.671
And now I'm gonna be done in by this.

82
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.990
Wouldn't be the first, John.

83
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.756
Come on, Les.

84
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.150
You saved me before,
you can do it again, right?

85
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.073
This is aggressive.

86
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.153
Twenty years ago,
you didn't wanna be here.

87
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.195
Now you don't wanna leave.

88
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.910
Yeah, that's a good idea.

89
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.671
John, you really need to prepare.

90
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.915
- Make arrangements.
- No need.

91
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.112
I already know exactly where I'm going.

92
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.837
- Morning.
- Good morning.

93
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.835
- Good morning.
- Detective.

94
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.752
- No, no, no.
- Angela, wait.

95
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.480
You don't need to see this, okay? No.

96
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.039
Give us the room, please.

97
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.951
Isabel.

98
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.595
She fell from the roof?

99
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.512
She jumped.

100
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.119
- No.
- Look...

101
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.273
I know it's hard to accept.
She was sick.

102
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.830
- Isabel wouldn't kill herself.
- Angie.

103
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.431
- She wouldn't kill herself.
- Detective.

104
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.874
- Period.
- Detective.

105
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.598
Period!

106
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.148
Angie, there were security cameras.

107
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.437
- Hold the door. You going down?
- Not if I can help it.

108
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.593
A new case?

109
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:29.279
The big score? The mother lode?
The one you've been waiting for?

110
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.353
- Humor me.
- Don't I always?

111
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.590
Oh, yeah, that's...
Much obliged. Thank you.

112
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.152
How you feeling, John?

113
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.913
So, what's new?

114
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.635
Bullet shavings from
the assassination attempt on the pope

115
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.270
holy-water ampoules
from the river Jordan

116
00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.602
and... oh, you'll love this.

117
00:17:59.628 --> 00:18:02.175
Screech beetle from Amityville.

118
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.154
Yeah, it's funny to you, but to the fallen,
that's like nails on a chalkboard.

119
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.312
What is it, exactly,
with you and bugs?

120
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.270
I just like them.

121
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.237
Yeah. Who doesn't?

122
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.276
Yeah, easy there, hero.

123
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.876
- That's dragon's breath.
- I thought you couldn't get it anymore.

124
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.636
Yeah, well, I know a guy
who knows a guy.

125
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.996
So, what's the action?

126
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.069
I just pulled a soldier demon
out of a little girl.

127
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.199
Looked like it was trying
to come through.

128
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.114
Yeah, I know how it sounds.

129
00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.475
No, we're finger puppets
to them, John

130
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.959
not doorways.

131
00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.033
They can work us, but they
can't come through onto our plane.

132
00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.714
Check the scrolls anyway.
See if there's any precedent.

133
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.711
Sure thing, John.

134
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.352
Anything else?

135
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.432
Wouldn't happen to have
anything for a...

136
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.314
On the house.

137
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.162
All right, question.

138
00:19:11.188 --> 00:19:13.794
How much longer do I have
to be your slave, John?

139
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.596
You're not my slave, Chas.

140
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.312
You're my very appreciated
apprentice.

141
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.550
Like Tonto or Robin.

142
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.309
Or that skinny fellow
with the fat friend.

143
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.189
Right. So then why don't I apprentice
something besides driving, then, John?

144
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.598
John? John.

145
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.360
I love our little talks, John!

146
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.152
May I take your coat,
mr. Constantine?

147
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.993
No, thanks,
I'm not gonna be staying long.

148
00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.551
- How about you, ma'am?
- Oh, no, I'm not staying long either.

149
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.115
I really need to speak with him.
It's very important.

150
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.874
First come, first served.

151
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.872
So you're rude no matter
where you are.

152
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.037
- Father.
- Hi.

153
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.157
- You have news. Yes.
- Yes, I spoke with the bishop.

154
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.474
I know what you want, son.

155
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.030
Still keeping your all-seeing eye
on me, Gabriel?

156
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.471
I'm flattered.

157
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.756
Well, I could offer something

158
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.993
about how a shepherd leads
even the most wayward of His flock

159
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.151
but it might sound disingenuous.

160
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.357
She has to have
a Catholic funeral, father.

161
00:20:53.383 --> 00:20:54.184
She has to.

162
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.259
- Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin.
- She didn't commit suicide.

163
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.834
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules, Angela.

164
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.991
Oh, rules!

165
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.912
Father.

166
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.594
David...

167
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.031
This is Isabel.

168
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.795
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

169
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.312
Please.

170
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.792
I'm sorry.

171
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.870
I've been seeing some
unusual soul traffic lately.

172
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.679
You might consider
giving me an extension.

173
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.308
I could do your side
some good these days.

174
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.630
You still trying to buy
your way into Heaven?

175
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.392
What about the minions
I've sent back?

176
00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.553
- That alone should guarantee my entry.
- How many times have I told you?

177
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.631
That's not the way this works.

178
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.394
Why, haven't I served him enough?

179
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.158
- What does he want from me?
- Only the usual.

180
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.278
Self-sacrifice, belief.

181
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.512
- Oh, I believe, for chrissake.
- No, no, you know.

182
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.830
And there's a difference.
You've seen.

183
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.471
I never asked to see.
I was born with this curse.

184
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.631
A gift, John.

185
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.189
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

186
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.750
I'm pulling demons out of little girls.

187
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.672
Who's that for?

188
00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.189
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

189
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.510
To earn your way
back into His good graces.

190
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.194
Impossible rules,
endless regulations

191
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.319
who goes up,
who goes down and why.

192
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.119
You don't even understand us.

193
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.274
You're the one
who should go to hell, half-breed.

194
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.397
Why me, Gabriel?

195
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.069
It's personal, isn't it?

196
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.720
I didn't go to church enough,
I didn't pray enough

197
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.158
I was 5 bucks short
in the collection plate. Why?

198
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.719
You are going to die young

199
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.634
because you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 15.

200
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.549
And you're going to go to hell

201
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.639
because of the life you took.

202
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.232
You're fucked.

203
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.715
At least it's nice out.

204
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.351
He always had a rotten
sense of humor.

205
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.197
And His punch lines are killers.

206
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.553
John!

207
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.709
Constantine, it's raining!
John! Hey!

208
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.235
<i>Twenty-two women were found buried
in the assailant's back yard.</i>

209
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.949
<i>So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match...</i>

210
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.475
<i>Police report she had been
physically penetrated</i>

211
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.279
<i>over 100 times and buried alive.</i>

212
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.035
<i>Found locked in a storage freezer,
his head severed and his organs...</i>

213
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.918
<i>He stuffed Holly's body into...</i>

214
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.914
<i>The bodies ravished by the unknown...
He used a small handsaw...</i>

215
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.390
<i>Had nearly decapitated...
Even his eyes were gouged out...</i>

216
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.152
<i>Isabel.</i>

217
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.156
I'm so sorry, Izzy.

218
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.312
<i>Constantine.</i>

219
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.837
Dodson.

220
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.712
Hello?

221
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.072
Hello.

222
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.032
Hello?

223
00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.798
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

224
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.514
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

225
00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.176
I know where you're going, John.

226
00:27:56.202 --> 00:27:58.658
I know where you're going.
You're going to Midnite's.

227
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.392
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

228
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.189
It's a haven for those who rise and fall.
I remember reading about this, John.

229
00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.999
- You read too much, kid. It's a bar.
- It's a bar?

230
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.000
It's a bar.

231
00:28:08.026 --> 00:28:11.383
Papa Midnite is a crusader for good.
He swore the oath of neutrality.

232
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.034
- John, the man's a legend.
- Yeah.

233
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.589
Can you please get me
into this bar, John, please?

234
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.439
I'm begging you, John, please?
Please?

235
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.435
- Sure, you can get in.
- I can get in?

236
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.716
If you can get in.

237
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.994
If I can get?.. It's a bear, though, right?
Or two ducks in... two ducks in a cloud?

238
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.512
Two frogs on a bench.

239
00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.558
Two frogs on a bench.

240
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.631
No, no, I'm with the guy you just...

241
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.597
John! John!

242
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.671
I'm with him, though.

243
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.637
Rat in a dress.

244
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.034
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

245
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.077

You've been absent some time.

260
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.473
Have you come here
with relics to sell?

261
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.912
No, I'm out of that now.
I've been too busy.

262
00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.797
Perhaps peddling forgeries
has ended up being bad for your health.

263
00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.837
Midnite, Jesus!

264
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.276
I thought the thing was authentic.

265
00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.712
I see now.

266
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.077
Your health is bad for other reasons.
How long?

267
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.958
A few months, maybe a year.

268
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.680
I thought I heard thunder last night.

269
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.832
Must have been
satan's stomach growling.

270
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.959
You're the one soul he'd come
up here himself to collect.

271
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.350
So I've heard.

272
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.680
Well, I am most certain
you did not come here

273
00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.877
for a sympathetic shoulder
to cry on.

274
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.710
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

275
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.036
They don't like you, John.

276
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.997
How many have you
deported back to hell?

277
00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.517
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.
A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.

278
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.319
Clearly I do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

279
00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.710
And yesterday I saw a soldier demon

280
00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.269
trying to chew its way out
through a little girl.

281
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.991
Listen, John, demons stay in hell,
angels in Heaven

282
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.594
the great détente
of the original superpowers.

283
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:10.476
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite.
You've been a tremendous help.

284
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.153
Now

285
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.639
I need to use the chair.

286
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.111
John, forgetting the fact that it would
almost certainly kill you

287
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.918
you know I am neutral.

288
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.153
And as long as the balance
is maintained, I take no sides.

289
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.791
Before you were a bartender

290
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.148
you were one witch doctor
against, what, 30 Ashgar?

291
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.878
- And I...
- You were... Constantine.

292
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.273
The John Constantine.

293
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.632
Once.

294
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.196
This isn't the usual game,
I can feel it.

295
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.669
Something's coming.

296
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.357
Spooky.

297
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.278
Balthazar.

298
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.353
That expression alone
has made my entire night.

299
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.393
I'll make your night.

300
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.109
I'll deport your sorry ass right
where you stand, you half-breed shit!

301
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.350
You know the rules of my house.
While here, you will abide by them.

302
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.397
Johnny boy.

303
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.799
Word is you're on your way down.

304
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.076
Fresh meat.

305
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.470
Finger-licking good.

306
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.552
We have a meeting now, John.

307
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.430
What? I didn't catch that.

308
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.355
Welcome to my life.

309
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.794
Mr. Constantine.

310
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.150
- I saw you...
- I remember.

311
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.638
- And then I saw you at the...
- Regular kismet.

312
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.156
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that would be okay.

313
00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.278
I'm not really in the talking mood
right now.

314
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.989
Well, maybe you could
just listen then.

315
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.192
Please?

316
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.758
Always a catch.

317
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.594
My sister was murdered yesterday.

318
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.593
- Sorry to hear.
- Thanks.

319
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.636
She was a patient at Ravenscar.
She jumped off the roof.

320
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.157
Thought you said she was murdered.

321
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.198
Yeah, well, Isabel wouldn't
have taken her own life.

322
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.875
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

323
00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.830
That's just crazy.

324
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.388
Look, I've heard your name
around the precinct.

325
00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:52.554
I know the circles you travel in.
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

326
00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.190
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

327
00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:00.876
She started talking
about demons, angels.

328
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.679
Now, I think someone got to her,
mr. Constantine.

329
00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.469
I think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

330
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.918
Some kind of legion or cult.

331
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.919
Sounds like a theory, detective.

332
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.433
Good luck.

333
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.114
I thought with your background,
you could at least

334
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.872
point me in the right direction.

335
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.270
Yeah, okay, sure.

336
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.391
It wasn't a suicide.

337
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.630
My sister was a devout Catholic.

338
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.189
Do you understand what that means?
That means If she took her own life...

339
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.033
Her soul would go straight to hell

340
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:43.115
where she'd be ripped apart over
and over in screaming, brutal agony

341
00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.397
for all eternity. That it?

342
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.516
That about right?

343
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.236
Goddamn you.

344
00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.753
Detective.

345
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.639
What if I told you that God
and the devil made a wager

346
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.156
a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

347
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.709
I'd tell you to stay on your meds.

348
00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.704
Humor me.

349
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:41.023
No direct contact with humans.
That would be the rule.

350
00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:45.359
- Just influence. See who would win.
- Okay, I'm humoring you.

351
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.511
- Why?
- Who knows.

352
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.638
- Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling.
- Oh, so it's fun.

353
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:55.590
It's fun when a man beats his wife to death,
it's fun when a mother drowns her baby.

354
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.355
And you think
the devil is responsible?

355
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.159
People are evil, mr. Constantine.
People.

356
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.630
You're right. We're born
capable of terrible things.

357
00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.395
Then sometimes something else comes
along and gives us just the right nudge.

358
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.870
Well, this has been real educational

359
00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.678
but I don't believe in the devil.

360
00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.150
You should. He believes in you.

361
00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.596
It's a power outage.

362
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.637
Not likely.

363
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.436
- What?
- We should go. Now.

364
00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.271
What is that?

365
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.992
Wings.

366
00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.795
Maybe talons.

367
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.714
You're kidding. Of what?

368
00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.558
Something that's not supposed
to be here.

369
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.834
That's really not going to help.

370
00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.800
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

371
00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.234
Suit yourself.

372
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.837
Demons stay in hell?

373
00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.111
Tell them that.

374
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.836
Don't worry.
Happens to everyone the first time.

375
00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.036
It's the sulfur.

376
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.511
Sulfur.

377
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.949
What were those things?

378
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.878
Demons.

379
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.832
- Scavengers of the damned.
- No, no. It's impossible.

380
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.629
Yeah. And I don't think
they were after me.

381
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.592
You really believe
she wouldn't commit suicide.

382
00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.113
Isabel?

383
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.871
Never in a million years.

384
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.231
Well, let's be sure.

385
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.829
Let's see if she's in hell.

386
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.390
Was it supposed to be hot or cold?

387
00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.910
In front of the chair.

388
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.432
I can't believe I'm doing this.

389
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.114
- These are all Isabel's things?
- Yeah.

390
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.032
- How about the cat?
- Duck?

391
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.711
Yeah, why?

392
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.994
Duck.

393
00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.390
Oh, you think that's strange.

394
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.959
Cats are good.

395
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.678
Half in, half out anyway.

396
00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.312
If this is some kind of spell
or something

397
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.517
don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

398
00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.910
Why, do you have any?

399
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.033
- This is crazy.
- Yes.

400
00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.675
I need you to leave.

401
00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.199
- I'm sorry?
- Angela, please.

402
00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.231
The apartment.

403
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.912
Okay.

404
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.434
Be careful with that cat.

405
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.994
God, I hate this part.

406
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.473
- Isabel.
- Constantine.

407
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.813
Angela...

408
00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.319
Jesus!

409
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.032
- Constantine, what...
- Twins.

410
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.031
Jesus. What?

411
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.309
- You were twins.
- What did you say?

412
00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.040
- She killed herself.
- What?

413
00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.634
And she's damned for it.

414
00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.752
How is this possible?

415
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.952
I need to eat.

416
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.669
Hey! Hey, what are you doing in here?

417
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.392
Relax, man.

418
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.712
Slow down!

419
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.798
What the hell kind of place is this?

420
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.038
John.

421
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.949
When I was a kid, I could see things.

422
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.396
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

423
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.673
<i>Things you shouldn't have to see.</i>

424
00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.678
My parents were normal.
They did what most parents would do.

425
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.235
<i>They made it worse.</i>

426
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.273
You think you're crazy long enough

427
00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:07.994
you find a way out.

428
00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.075
<i>- You tried to kill yourself.
- I didn't try anything.</i>

429
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.678
<i>Officially, I was
dead for two minutes.</i>

430
00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.829
But when you cross over

431
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.190
time stops.

432
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.313
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

433
00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.355
When I came back

434
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.918
I knew

435
00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.879
all the things I could see were real.

436
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:46.075
Heaven and hell are right here.
Behind every wall, every window.

437
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:51.030
The world behind the world,
and we're smack in the middle.

438
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.590
Angels and demons
can't cross over onto our plane.

439
00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.558
So instead we get
what I call half-breeds.

440
00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.790
<i>The influence peddlers.</i>

441
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:06.193
<i>They can only whisper in our ears,
but a single word can give you courage</i>

442
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:10.239
<i>or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.</i>

443
00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.312
<i>Those with the demon's touch</i>

444
00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:18.315
<i>like those part angel,
living alongside us.</i>

445
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.869
They call it the balance.

446
00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.272
I call it hypocritical bullshit.

447
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.228
So when a half-breed breaks the rules

448
00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:32.508
I deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

449
00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.634
I don't get them all

450
00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.911
but I've been hoping
to get enough to ensure my

451
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.758
- ...retirement.
- I don't understand.

452
00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.756
I'm a suicide, Angela.

453
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.310
When I die, the rules say
I've got just one place to go.

454
00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.436
You're trying to buy
your way into Heaven.

455
00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.034
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison

456
00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.430
where half the inmates
were put there by you?

457
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.154
I guess God has a plan for all of us.

458
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.552
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

459
00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.676
He's not planning anything.

460
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.951
When we were little

461
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.388
Isabel saw things too.

462
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.953
Dodson.

463
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:26.796
Guard spotted him groping the body,
then he ran across the street.

464
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.918
Came in here, and he had a go
at the entire stock.

465
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.197
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

466
00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.274
Could've been a member
of my fraternity.

467
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.517
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

468
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.233
He's okay.

469
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.790
Why didn't you call me,
you son of a bitch?

470
00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.678
Yes?

471
00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:32.352
What do you mean?

472
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.673
What?

473
00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.319
How?

474
00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:50.352
Got it. Bye.

475
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.478
I need to see where Isabel died.

476
00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.677
<i>Séances, ouija boards, channeling.</i>

477
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.716
Our father thought she was
just trying to get attention.

478
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.315
She certainly did that.

479
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.876
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

480
00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.589
She'd scare my mother half to death.

481
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.880
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

482
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.190
So you had her committed.

483
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.634
Yeah.

484
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.392
How long?

485
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.398
Two weeks.

486
00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.552
This time.

487
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.604
She'd get better,
and then she'd get worse.

488
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:35.136
Recently, a lot worse.

489
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.510
That symbol that was cut
in the dead guy's hand

490
00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.875
does it have something
to do with this?

491
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.350
I'm a cop, John, remember?

492
00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:50.275
You don't walk off the roof of a building
without leaving something behind.

493
00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:55.116
And I showed you everything
she left behind in that box, but feel free.

494
00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:00.400
Maybe she left something else.
Not something a cop would find.

495
00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.592
Something just for you.

496
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:09.079
You were her twin, Angela.
Twins tend to think alike.

497
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.437
- I'm not like my sister.
- But you were once.

498
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.716
When you were kids.

499
00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.679
When you'd spend
every second with each other.

500
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.435
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

501
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.999
That was a long time ago.

502
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.037
That kind of bond doesn't
just disappear.

503
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.191
There is nothing here.

504
00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.797
- Hey. Come on.
- She planned her death in this room.

505
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.236
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

506
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.517
She knew you'd come.
She counted on you to see what she saw

507
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.592
feel what she felt,
know what she knew.

508
00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.474
- What did she do, Angela?
- How should I know?

509
00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.949
- What did she do, Angela?
- I don't know.

510
00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:50.272
- What would you do?
- I don't know.

511
00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:53.432
What did she do, Angela?
You know what she did.

512
00:54:53.458 --> 00:54:55.216
What did she do, Angela?

513
00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:57.574
You know what she did.
What are you afraid of?

514
00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.636
What did she do, Angela?

515
00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.910
- What did she do?
- I don't know!

516
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.796
When we were girls

517
00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.359
we would leave each other messages.

518
00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.717
In light.

519
00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:33.958
In breath.

520
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.598
On the windows.

521
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.868
John, there is no 17th act
in 'Corinthians'.

522
00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:52.555
'Corinthians' goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

523
00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.757
They have Bibles in hell?..

524
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.669
<i>Paints a different view of Revelations.</i>

525
00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.876
<i>Says the world will not end
by God's hand</i>

526
00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.918
<i>but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.</i>

527
00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.513
<i>Though if you ask me</i>

528
00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.997
fire's fire.

529
00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.233
<i>16:29, 16:30...</i>

530
00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.268
Oh, my, this is certainly not good.

531
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:20.149
"The sins of the father would only
be exceeded by the sins of the son."

532
00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:24.110
- Whose son?
- But he can't cross over, B.

533
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.794
- Impossible to cross over.
- Whose son? God's Son?

534
00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.270
No, the other one.
Devil had a son too.

535
00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.073
Here it is.

536
00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.196
This is the sign of Mammon

537
00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:38.638
the son of the devil.
Well, hold on, it says here...

538
00:56:39.399 --> 00:56:41.469
<i>- Beeman?</i>
- Yeah.

539
00:56:41.639 --> 00:56:44.517
Sorry, I'm...
I'm sorry, no, I'm right here.

540
00:56:45.479 --> 00:56:50.997
It says Mammon has no patience
for his father's rule

541
00:56:51.159 --> 00:56:56.836
and yearns to forge
his own kingdom of fire and blood.

542
00:57:01.559 --> 00:57:03.868
Mammon would be the last demon

543
00:57:04.039 --> 00:57:06.792
we'd ever want
crossing over to our plane.

544
00:57:06.959 --> 00:57:10.429
No, wait, wait, wait. I'm reading.
Seems to be a loophole.

545
00:57:10.599 --> 00:57:12.829
Always a catch.

546
00:57:13.239 --> 00:57:19.269
It says first Mammon would have
to possess a very, very powerful psychic.

547
00:57:19.439 --> 00:57:21.953
- Isabel.
<i>- But that wouldn't be enough.</i>

548
00:57:22.679 --> 00:57:26.957
To cross over, Mammon would need
divine assistance.

549
00:57:28.319 --> 00:57:32.312
To cross over, Mammon would need
the help of God.

550
00:57:33.319 --> 00:57:36.117
- The help of God?
<i>- It says...</i>

551
00:57:42.599 --> 00:57:45.955
<i>- Beeman?</i>
- John, look...

552
00:57:46.119 --> 00:57:50.431
I know you've never had much faith,
you've never had much reason to

553
00:57:50.599 --> 00:57:54.194
<i>but that doesn't mean
that we don't have faith</i>

554
00:57:55.039 --> 00:57:56.711
in you.

555
00:57:59.719 --> 00:58:02.279
Beeman? Beeman?

556
00:58:02.799 --> 00:58:05.188
Drive. Fast.

557
00:58:20.679 --> 00:58:22.556
Beeman!

558
00:58:22.959 --> 00:58:24.597
Sulfur.

559
00:58:25.719 --> 00:58:27.550
Beeman!

560
00:58:31.639 --> 00:58:33.197
Beeman!

561
00:59:40.359 --> 00:59:42.509
Wasn't just Isabel.

562
00:59:43.759 --> 00:59:45.238
I used to see things too.

563
00:59:47.239 --> 00:59:48.831
But

564
00:59:48.999 --> 00:59:52.708
- ...you already knew that, didn't you?
- Go home, Angela.

565
00:59:52.879 --> 00:59:54.278
I need to understand.

566
00:59:54.439 --> 00:59:56.828
You don't wanna know
what's out there, trust me.

567
00:59:56.999 --> 00:59:58.990
I'm stronger than Isabel.

568
00:59:59.159 --> 01:00:01.667
Your sister embraced her gift,
you denied yours.

569
01:00:01.693 --> 01:00:03.372
Denial is a better idea.

570
01:00:03.419 --> 01:00:07.815
It's why you're still alive.
Stick with me, that will change.

571
01:00:07.879 --> 01:00:09.756
I don't need another ghost
following me.

572
01:00:09.919 --> 01:00:12.353
John, they killed my sister.

573
01:00:16.359 --> 01:00:18.748
I'd trade places with her if I could.

574
01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:24.353
I used to pretend that I didn't.

575
01:00:24.999 --> 01:00:27.308
That I didn't see things.

576
01:00:27.679 --> 01:00:29.192
And

577
01:00:30.279 --> 01:00:34.431
by the time we were 10,
they started forcing her to take

578
01:00:34.759 --> 01:00:37.148
antipsychotics

579
01:00:38.119 --> 01:00:40.394
and have treatments.
They would come for her

580
01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:44.154
and she'd look at me,
and she'd say to me "Tell them."

581
01:00:44.319 --> 01:00:47.994
"Why don't you tell them, Angie,
that you can see them too?"

582
01:00:49.119 --> 01:00:50.393
But I lied.

583
01:00:51.239 --> 01:00:53.150
I said:

584
01:00:54.599 --> 01:00:56.829
"I don't see anything."

585
01:00:57.759 --> 01:00:59.875
Until one day

586
01:01:00.799 --> 01:01:02.357
I finally stopped seeing.

587
01:01:04.719 --> 01:01:07.074
I abandoned her, John.

588
01:01:07.879 --> 01:01:10.234
I left her all alone.

589
01:01:17.159 --> 01:01:19.389
I need to see what she saw.

590
01:01:21.159 --> 01:01:22.797
Please.

591
01:01:26.999 --> 01:01:30.548
You do this,
there's no turning back.

592
01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:34.270
You see them

593
01:01:35.239 --> 01:01:36.991
they see you.

594
01:01:37.839 --> 01:01:39.750
Understand?

595
01:01:40.559 --> 01:01:42.117
Yeah.

596
01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:49.797
Sure.

597
01:02:26.759 --> 01:02:31.071
So do I have to take the rest
of my clothes off, or can I leave them on?

598
01:02:37.239 --> 01:02:38.831
John?

599
01:02:39.159 --> 01:02:40.990
I'm thinking.

600
01:02:44.839 --> 01:02:46.397
John?

601
01:02:46.959 --> 01:02:48.950
On is fine.

602
01:03:01.119 --> 01:03:04.475
- So why water?
- It's a universal conduit.

603
01:03:04.879 --> 01:03:08.508
Lubricates the transition
from one plane to another.

604
01:03:08.679 --> 01:03:12.797
- Now ask me if there's water in hell.
- Is there water in hell?

605
01:03:14.519 --> 01:03:15.918
Sit.

606
01:03:17.239 --> 01:03:21.312
Normally, only a portion of the body
has to be suspended

607
01:03:23.879 --> 01:03:25.756
but you wanted the crash course.

608
01:03:25.919 --> 01:03:28.513
Yeah, I wanted the crash course.

609
01:03:28.719 --> 01:03:30.675
So...

610
01:03:31.079 --> 01:03:33.035
So, what's gonna happen?

611
01:03:33.199 --> 01:03:34.791
Lie down.

612
01:03:35.039 --> 01:03:38.748
- What do you mean lie down?
- You have to be fully submerged.

613
01:03:40.759 --> 01:03:42.112
For how long?

614
01:03:42.799 --> 01:03:44.471
As long as it takes.

615
01:03:54.199 --> 01:03:56.190
Take a deep one.

616
01:05:34.439 --> 01:05:36.475
Oh, God.

617
01:05:37.119 --> 01:05:40.111
Oh, God, all those people.

618
01:05:40.999 --> 01:05:43.035
Oh, Isabel.

619
01:05:43.479 --> 01:05:44.753
I've always known.

620
01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:49.278
I've always known where they are.
I've always known where to find them

621
01:05:49.439 --> 01:05:52.431
where... where to aim
and where... where to duck

622
01:05:52.599 --> 01:05:54.430
and I've always known
where they were.

623
01:05:54.599 --> 01:05:56.555
I've always known
that it wasn't luck.

624
01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:59.333
Always known that it wasn't luck.
I've always known that it wasn't...

625
01:05:59.399 --> 01:06:02.436
I've always known that I could see.

626
01:06:02.599 --> 01:06:07.719
I've always known that I could see.

627
01:06:12.399 --> 01:06:14.071
Angela.

628
01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:20.029
Someone was here.

629
01:06:45.319 --> 01:06:46.798
It was his.

630
01:06:48.039 --> 01:06:49.836
Rolling.

631
01:06:51.839 --> 01:06:53.670
Not a ball.

632
01:06:55.399 --> 01:06:57.151
Something smaller.

633
01:06:59.839 --> 01:07:01.397
Shiny.

634
01:07:32.839 --> 01:07:35.034
Balthazar.

635
01:08:05.959 --> 01:08:07.517
Sorry.

636
01:08:14.439 --> 01:08:16.509
Can you just kill him?

637
01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:18.713
What about the balance?

638
01:08:18.879 --> 01:08:22.394
Half-breed tipped the scales
when he started killing my friends.

639
01:08:22.559 --> 01:08:24.914
I'm just adding some counterweight.

640
01:08:57.359 --> 01:08:59.395
John, I really want...

641
01:09:05.239 --> 01:09:08.197
Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

642
01:09:15.559 --> 01:09:17.515
I'm coming with you.

643
01:09:18.799 --> 01:09:21.154
You're staying in the car.

644
01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:47.312
Fire? I was born of this.

645
01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:51.831
How's Mammon crossing over,
you half-breed piece of shit?

646
01:09:55.679 --> 01:09:58.989
That's better. Au naturel.

647
01:10:05.839 --> 01:10:07.955
"Stay in the car."

648
01:10:08.119 --> 01:10:10.394
"Wait here."

649
01:10:11.079 --> 01:10:12.353
Men.

650
01:10:25.519 --> 01:10:26.872
Don't fight it, Johnny boy.

651
01:10:28.399 --> 01:10:30.310
Enjoy it.

652
01:11:02.399 --> 01:11:06.028
We'll see you very soon.

653
01:11:06.439 --> 01:11:08.191
Not really, no.

654
01:11:08.359 --> 01:11:13.308
You can't cheat it this time.
You're going back to hell.

655
01:11:13.479 --> 01:11:14.912
True.

656
01:11:15.079 --> 01:11:16.353
But you're not.

657
01:11:17.959 --> 01:11:20.632
- What are you doing?
- I'm reading you your last rites.

658
01:11:20.799 --> 01:11:24.314
Spare me your remedial
incantations.

659
01:11:24.479 --> 01:11:26.709
You do know what it is
to truly be forgiven?

660
01:11:26.879 --> 01:11:29.313
To be welcomed
into the Kingdom of God?

661
01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.791
Demon in Heaven.

662
01:11:32.439 --> 01:11:35.272
I'd love to be a fly on that wall.

663
01:11:35.439 --> 01:11:39.512
You're not a priest.
You have no power.

664
01:11:40.839 --> 01:11:42.750
Just tell me how Mammon
is crossing over

665
01:11:42.919 --> 01:11:45.877
and you can go back
to your shithole.

666
01:11:48.519 --> 01:11:51.829
Okay, Bally, enjoy it.

667
01:11:54.613 --> 01:11:58.713
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

668
01:12:01.639 --> 01:12:06.315
"May God have mercy on you
and grant you the pardon of all your sins."

669
01:12:06.879 --> 01:12:11.111
"Whosesoever sins you remit on Earth,
they are remitted unto them in Heaven."

670
01:12:13.199 --> 01:12:15.667
- How? How's he doing it?
- No.

671
01:12:15.839 --> 01:12:17.113
No, I can't.

672
01:12:18.919 --> 01:12:22.116
Grant Your child entry
into Thy Kingdom

673
01:12:22.759 --> 01:12:27.514
in the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

674
01:12:27.799 --> 01:12:29.337
Ame...!

675
01:12:29.362 --> 01:12:30.762
Sangre de Dio!

676
01:12:32.439 --> 01:12:35.511
The blood of God.

677
01:12:35.679 --> 01:12:36.953
He found it.

678
01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:41.198
Whatever killed the Son of God

679
01:12:41.359 --> 01:12:46.672
will give birth
to the son of the devil.

680
01:12:48.719 --> 01:12:50.471
By the way

681
01:12:52.399 --> 01:12:56.153
you have to ask for absolution
to be forgiven

682
01:12:56.999 --> 01:12:58.227
asshole.

683
01:13:01.999 --> 01:13:05.309
My work here is done.

684
01:13:06.639 --> 01:13:11.269
- What are you laughing at?
- She was my only mission

685
01:13:11.439 --> 01:13:15.478
and you brought her right to us.

686
01:13:18.319 --> 01:13:21.516
So does this walking fast
mean you've found something?

687
01:13:21.679 --> 01:13:24.011
Jesus didn't die
 from being nailed to a cross.

688
01:13:24.037 --> 01:13:25.922
He was killed by a soldier's spear.

689
01:13:25.959 --> 01:13:28.029
The Spear of Destiny.

690
01:13:28.439 --> 01:13:31.033
I'm a Catholic, John.
I know the crucifixion story.

691
01:13:39.559 --> 01:13:44.189
I drew out the sister as you asked.

692
01:13:44.519 --> 01:13:49.752
She's been made flush and ready.

693
01:13:49.919 --> 01:13:53.514
So much power.

694
01:13:53.799 --> 01:13:58.793
Now, if you grant me my resurrection,
I shall serve.

695
01:14:01.279 --> 01:14:04.669
Wait... But I did as we agreed.

696
01:14:04.839 --> 01:14:08.309
No. Please. No!

697
01:14:10.999 --> 01:14:15.834
Beeman said Mammon needed
divine assistance to cross over.

698
01:14:16.799 --> 01:14:20.189
How's the blood of God's only son?

699
01:14:20.479 --> 01:14:22.754
The stains on the spear.

700
01:14:23.999 --> 01:14:26.752
- Yeah.
- So he gets the Spear.

701
01:14:26.919 --> 01:14:28.989
He still has to locate
a powerful psychic.

702
01:14:30.119 --> 01:14:31.552
Not really.

703
01:14:34.519 --> 01:14:35.793
Twins.

704
01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.231
Where's the amulet?

705
01:14:40.439 --> 01:14:43.397
I don't know,
I must have left it in the...

706
01:14:44.999 --> 01:14:46.273
What's wrong?

707
01:14:46.799 --> 01:14:48.437
I don't know, I just feel...

708
01:15:19.079 --> 01:15:20.637
- Bird on a ladder.
- Sorry.

709
01:15:25.999 --> 01:15:28.069
- Wait here.
- Yeah.

710
01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.957
Who's a rat in a dress now, bitch?

711
01:15:47.359 --> 01:15:49.748
Have you lost
what little mind you have?

712
01:15:49.999 --> 01:15:51.512
Don't.

713
01:15:52.359 --> 01:15:54.998
I need to use the chair.

714
01:15:55.159 --> 01:15:59.038
I offer no aid to one side
or the other.

715
01:15:59.999 --> 01:16:02.638
- The balance.
- Screw the balance.

716
01:16:08.479 --> 01:16:10.868
You dare?! In my house?!

717
01:16:13.679 --> 01:16:16.796
Is this neutral? Bullshit.

718
01:16:16.999 --> 01:16:19.797
You're the only one still playing
by the rules, Midnite.

719
01:16:19.959 --> 01:16:23.554
And while you've been imitating
Switzerland, people are dying.

720
01:16:24.039 --> 01:16:27.952
Hennessy, Beeman, they were
your friends once too, remember?

721
01:16:28.999 --> 01:16:31.593
I need your help!

722
01:16:33.639 --> 01:16:36.073
Consider it a last request.

723
01:16:39.719 --> 01:16:42.438
You play a dangerous game.

724
01:16:49.319 --> 01:16:51.230
Two-hundred-dollar shirt,
by the way.

725
01:16:53.159 --> 01:16:57.630
That little shit has been trying to climb
out of his father's shadow for eons.

726
01:16:57.799 --> 01:17:02.509
I'd hate to think what he would do
to this world if he ever broke through.

727
01:17:05.479 --> 01:17:07.754
Forgot how big it was.

728
01:17:08.119 --> 01:17:12.351
Two hundred souls passed through
this wood and steel at Sing Sing.

729
01:17:12.519 --> 01:17:14.111
Yeah.

730
01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:19.269
Which way's east?

731
01:17:36.359 --> 01:17:38.919
How many years since you've surfed?

732
01:17:40.119 --> 01:17:41.996
Like riding a bike.

733
01:17:42.159 --> 01:17:44.070
No, not really.

734
01:17:46.679 --> 01:17:49.352
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

735
01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:54.672
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

736
01:18:00.799 --> 01:18:02.152
Cold.

737
01:18:02.319 --> 01:18:04.355
Little flavor?

738
01:18:26.799 --> 01:18:28.710
- Sure about this?
- No.

739
01:19:16.839 --> 01:19:18.431
Midnite!

740
01:19:23.919 --> 01:19:26.911
- Any luck?
- That's a word for it.

741
01:19:27.239 --> 01:19:30.515
Holy shit. You're Papa Midnite,
aren't you?

742
01:19:37.959 --> 01:19:42.157
And how exactly do you intend
on getting close enough to use these?

743
01:19:44.159 --> 01:19:47.196
Well, they did not leave her
unguarded.

744
01:19:47.359 --> 01:19:48.951
Half-breeds are most vulnerable

745
01:19:49.119 --> 01:19:52.907
when their outer skin
is breached by holy water.

746
01:19:53.359 --> 01:19:56.556
Certain objects, most notably
either of the two crosses of Isteria

747
01:19:56.719 --> 01:19:59.108
have been used by even
the unordained to bless

748
01:19:59.279 --> 01:20:01.076
commonly occurring waters

749
01:20:01.239 --> 01:20:02.911
even rain.

750
01:20:03.439 --> 01:20:04.758
Maybe if...

751
01:20:09.199 --> 01:20:12.509
There's no use sitting on the bench
if you're not ready to play, right?

752
01:20:12.679 --> 01:20:16.388
You wouldn't have one of those
enchanted crosses here in a cabinet

753
01:20:16.559 --> 01:20:18.550
maybe we could take with us?

754
01:20:18.759 --> 01:20:23.071
Look, John, no offense, I just don't think
that it's a great idea, you know

755
01:20:23.239 --> 01:20:26.436
you going on a solo mission
to save the world. That's my vote.

756
01:20:26.599 --> 01:20:29.159
I don't know what pops thinks,
but that's...

757
01:20:30.439 --> 01:20:33.351
Take him, John. Kill him after.

758
01:20:38.279 --> 01:20:42.397
If you get back, see me
about membership. Maybe.

759
01:20:42.559 --> 01:20:45.357
Okay. I will.

760
01:20:49.919 --> 01:20:52.114
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

761
01:20:52.279 --> 01:20:55.112
Praying. Okay.

762
01:20:55.999 --> 01:20:57.591
Come on.

763
01:21:52.279 --> 01:21:53.758
Half-breeds, right?

764
01:21:56.519 --> 01:22:00.831
A birth like this, they're definitely
gonna be guarding her, right? Definitely.

765
01:22:01.239 --> 01:22:02.672
Yeah.

766
01:22:05.559 --> 01:22:07.304
We need through.

767
01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:10.096
I mean, that cross 
has gotta work, right?

768
01:22:10.279 --> 01:22:11.632
Right?

769
01:22:11.959 --> 01:22:15.190
It's not always like it is in the books.

770
01:23:01.599 --> 01:23:03.271
What is that?

771
01:23:03.759 --> 01:23:05.670
Hellspeak.

772
01:23:08.199 --> 01:23:10.190
You know what to do.

773
01:23:13.319 --> 01:23:14.911
I'm okay.

774
01:23:16.679 --> 01:23:18.351
Sure.

775
01:23:29.679 --> 01:23:32.193
One last show.

776
01:24:04.719 --> 01:24:06.277
Hi.

777
01:24:06.839 --> 01:24:08.113
My name's John.

778
01:24:10.279 --> 01:24:13.635
You are in violation of the balance.

779
01:24:14.439 --> 01:24:16.714
Leave immediately

780
01:24:16.999 --> 01:24:19.559
or I will deport you.

781
01:24:21.439 --> 01:24:23.191
All of you.

782
01:24:30.279 --> 01:24:32.110
Go to hell.

783
01:24:37.519 --> 01:24:38.918
Holy water?

784
01:25:53.439 --> 01:25:55.555
Angela...

785
01:26:26.559 --> 01:26:28.117
John?

786
01:26:30.319 --> 01:26:31.593
John.

787
01:26:37.119 --> 01:26:38.598
Shit.

788
01:27:02.919 --> 01:27:04.238
Pull!

789
01:27:43.479 --> 01:27:44.753
Angela.

790
01:28:07.319 --> 01:28:09.355
Angela, what is it?

791
01:28:15.799 --> 01:28:17.994
Get it out.

792
01:28:18.019 --> 01:28:24.519
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

793
01:28:30.919 --> 01:28:32.398
Get it out.

794
01:28:32.959 --> 01:28:34.915
Get it...

795
01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:54.940
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

796
01:28:55.765 --> 01:29:05.765
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

797
01:29:17.079 --> 01:29:18.353
Oh, my God.

798
01:29:25.319 --> 01:29:26.832
Not bad, kid.

799
01:29:29.719 --> 01:29:31.630
"Not bad". You hear that?

800
01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:33.233
You know why that is?

801
01:29:33.259 --> 01:29:36.056
It's because this is Kramer.
Chas Kramer, ass...

802
01:29:43.599 --> 01:29:45.430
Chas...

803
01:29:53.119 --> 01:29:55.587
You're right, John.

804
01:29:56.799 --> 01:29:58.437
It's not like the books.

805
01:29:59.559 --> 01:30:01.151
No

806
01:30:02.039 --> 01:30:03.791
it isn't.

807
01:30:23.879 --> 01:30:26.552
Into the light, I command thee.

808
01:30:27.559 --> 01:30:30.869
Into the light, I command thee.

809
01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:35.918
Into the light, I command thee.

810
01:30:40.279 --> 01:30:43.749
Into the light, I command thee.

811
01:30:46.839 --> 01:30:49.592
Your ego is astounding.

812
01:30:49.759 --> 01:30:51.477
Gabriel.

813
01:30:51.639 --> 01:30:52.913
Figures.

814
01:30:54.079 --> 01:30:57.355
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

815
01:30:57.519 --> 01:30:59.828
You judging me now, John?

816
01:31:01.039 --> 01:31:04.873
Betrayal, murder, genocide,
call me provincial.

817
01:31:05.039 --> 01:31:08.827
I am simply seeking to inspire mankind
to all that was intended.

818
01:31:09.239 --> 01:31:12.754
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

819
01:31:13.439 --> 01:31:14.713
Help me here.

820
01:31:18.599 --> 01:31:22.717
You're handed
this precious gift, right?

821
01:31:23.879 --> 01:31:27.758
Each one of you granted redemption
from the Creator.

822
01:31:28.719 --> 01:31:31.153
Murderers, rapists and molesters

823
01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:33.549
all of you, you just have to repent

824
01:31:33.719 --> 01:31:36.438
and God takes you into His bosom.

825
01:31:38.679 --> 01:31:40.829
In all the worlds in all the universe

826
01:31:40.999 --> 01:31:43.797
no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

827
01:31:46.159 --> 01:31:47.433
It's not fair.

828
01:31:51.439 --> 01:31:55.227
If sweet, sweet God loves you so

829
01:31:55.399 --> 01:31:58.277
then I'll make you worthy of His love.

830
01:31:59.879 --> 01:32:02.871
I've been watching you
for a long time.

831
01:32:03.039 --> 01:32:07.510
It's only in the face of horror
that you truly find your nobler selves.

832
01:32:07.679 --> 01:32:11.354
And you can be so noble.

833
01:32:13.959 --> 01:32:15.472
So

834
01:32:16.119 --> 01:32:18.349
I'll bring you pain.

835
01:32:18.999 --> 01:32:21.274
I'll bring you horror.

836
01:32:22.919 --> 01:32:25.877
So that you may rise above it.

837
01:32:29.199 --> 01:32:32.953
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth

838
01:32:33.119 --> 01:32:35.952
will be worthy of God's love.

839
01:32:36.119 --> 01:32:37.837
Gabriel

840
01:32:38.279 --> 01:32:40.429
you're insane.

841
01:32:42.279 --> 01:32:45.351
The road to salvation begins tonight.

842
01:32:46.119 --> 01:32:47.757
Right now.

843
01:33:27.719 --> 01:33:30.597
I know I'm not one of your favorites.

844
01:33:32.079 --> 01:33:34.718
I'm not even welcome in your house.

845
01:33:36.239 --> 01:33:38.958
But I could use a little attention.

846
01:33:42.119 --> 01:33:43.757
Please.

847
01:34:28.239 --> 01:34:30.514
Come forth.

848
01:34:49.479 --> 01:34:51.276
Hurry.

849
01:35:07.799 --> 01:35:09.596
Mammon

850
01:35:09.759 --> 01:35:12.114
son of satan

851
01:35:12.279 --> 01:35:16.557
I unleash you unto this world.

852
01:36:08.119 --> 01:36:09.393
Lu.

853
01:36:09.559 --> 01:36:11.550
What took you so long?

854
01:36:11.719 --> 01:36:13.914
Hello, John.

855
01:36:14.599 --> 01:36:17.796
John, hello.

856
01:36:22.439 --> 01:36:25.272
You're the one soul

857
01:36:25.639 --> 01:36:29.109
I would come up here
to collect myself.

858
01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:34.594
So I've heard.

859
01:36:35.319 --> 01:36:36.593
You mind?

860
01:36:37.599 --> 01:36:39.874
Oh, go... Go right ahead.
I've got stock.

861
01:36:40.839 --> 01:36:42.192
Coffin nail.

862
01:36:42.679 --> 01:36:44.476
Very fitting, John.

863
01:36:47.239 --> 01:36:50.629
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons

864
01:36:50.799 --> 01:36:53.472
finger movement goes out the window.

865
01:36:53.639 --> 01:36:55.630
Let me help you.

866
01:37:06.559 --> 01:37:08.072
See?

867
01:37:09.839 --> 01:37:11.192
Sonny

868
01:37:11.359 --> 01:37:16.274
I've got a whole theme park
full of red delights for you.

869
01:37:16.999 --> 01:37:18.478
Well, aren't you a peach?

870
01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:23.874
I didn't think you would make
the same mistake twice.

871
01:37:28.519 --> 01:37:30.396
And you didn't

872
01:37:31.119 --> 01:37:32.791
did you?

873
01:37:33.079 --> 01:37:34.637
So how's the family?

874
01:37:34.799 --> 01:37:38.561
Family's doing just fine.
Busy, busy, busy, busy.

875
01:37:38.587 --> 01:37:40.435
Need a vacation.

876
01:37:40.839 --> 01:37:44.195
Word is that kid of yours
is a chip off the old block.

877
01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:47.271
Well, one does what one can.

878
01:37:47.439 --> 01:37:48.997
He's in the other room.

879
01:37:49.159 --> 01:37:51.832
Boys will be boys.

880
01:37:52.999 --> 01:37:54.273
With Gabriel.

881
01:37:56.999 --> 01:37:59.672
No accounting for taste, really.

882
01:38:00.039 --> 01:38:02.348
They have the Spear of Destiny.

883
01:38:04.999 --> 01:38:08.548
"They have the Spear of Destiny".

884
01:38:16.519 --> 01:38:19.591
Or is it another one of your cons?

885
01:38:21.599 --> 01:38:23.794
Go look for yourself.

886
01:38:26.719 --> 01:38:30.189
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu

887
01:38:30.559 --> 01:38:33.471
what's another 20 seconds?

888
01:39:35.559 --> 01:39:40.553
- Lucifer.
- This world is mine. In time.

889
01:39:40.719 --> 01:39:43.187
You, best of all of us, Gabriel

890
01:39:43.359 --> 01:39:48.353
should understand ambition.

891
01:39:48.519 --> 01:39:50.908
Son of perdition.

892
01:39:51.759 --> 01:39:53.033
Little horn.

893
01:39:55.079 --> 01:39:57.195
Most unclean.

894
01:39:57.359 --> 01:39:59.873
I do miss the old names.

895
01:40:00.719 --> 01:40:02.835
Time to go home, son.

896
01:40:02.999 --> 01:40:05.354
I will smite thee

897
01:40:05.519 --> 01:40:08.317
in His honor.

898
01:40:13.239 --> 01:40:18.154
Looks like somebody
doesn't have your back anymore.

899
01:40:35.239 --> 01:40:36.991
Father?

900
01:40:59.439 --> 01:41:00.792
So...

901
01:41:07.519 --> 01:41:08.793
So?

902
01:41:09.159 --> 01:41:12.754
Yeah, what do you want?
An extension?

903
01:41:17.319 --> 01:41:19.230
The sister

904
01:41:20.119 --> 01:41:21.393
Isabel.

905
01:41:23.239 --> 01:41:25.070
What about her?

906
01:41:26.999 --> 01:41:29.308
Let her go home.

907
01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:36.310
You're willing to give up your life
so she can go to Heaven?

908
01:41:45.719 --> 01:41:48.631
Fine. It's done.

909
01:41:51.159 --> 01:41:54.469
Time to go, John.

910
01:41:54.799 --> 01:41:56.357
Yeah.

911
01:42:51.839 --> 01:42:53.750
The sacrifice.

912
01:43:04.879 --> 01:43:10.636
No. This one belongs to me.

913
01:43:20.199 --> 01:43:25.796
No. You will live, John Constantine.

914
01:43:28.759 --> 01:43:30.112
You will live.

915
01:43:32.599 --> 01:43:34.954
So you will have

916
01:43:36.599 --> 01:43:39.113
the chance to prove

917
01:43:41.639 --> 01:43:46.793
that your soul truly belongs in hell.

918
01:43:49.719 --> 01:43:52.677
Oh, you will live.

919
01:43:56.839 --> 01:44:00.548
You will live.

920
01:45:11.319 --> 01:45:13.230
Thank you.

921
01:45:15.559 --> 01:45:17.436
No problem.

922
01:45:32.839 --> 01:45:34.511
Human.

923
01:45:36.359 --> 01:45:38.793
You don't deserve to be human.

924
01:45:40.239 --> 01:45:44.755
Do you want revenge?
Is that what you're thinking right now?

925
01:45:47.119 --> 01:45:48.632
Do it.

926
01:45:49.879 --> 01:45:51.358
Do it.

927
01:45:52.839 --> 01:45:54.909
Seek revenge.

928
01:45:55.079 --> 01:45:57.274
End my life.

929
01:45:57.959 --> 01:45:59.438
Go on.

930
01:46:01.479 --> 01:46:02.912
Be the hand of God.

931
01:46:03.079 --> 01:46:05.354
It's your choice.

932
01:46:05.519 --> 01:46:07.669
It's always been your choice.

933
01:46:12.759 --> 01:46:14.112
Yeah.

934
01:46:19.559 --> 01:46:21.834
That's called pain.

935
01:46:21.999 --> 01:46:23.318
Get used to it.

936
01:46:29.479 --> 01:46:31.549
You could've shot me, John!

937
01:46:33.599 --> 01:46:36.352
You chose a higher path!

938
01:46:37.719 --> 01:46:40.392
Look how well you're doing!

939
01:47:04.879 --> 01:47:06.835
Nice spot.

940
01:47:10.919 --> 01:47:12.352
I have something for you.

941
01:47:15.279 --> 01:47:17.918
Something tells me
you're not a flowers kind of guy.

942
01:47:20.839 --> 01:47:23.273
Oh, how thoughtful.

943
01:47:28.359 --> 01:47:30.111
John

944
01:47:31.519 --> 01:47:33.714
why are you giving me this?

945
01:47:33.879 --> 01:47:35.278
Rules.

946
01:47:35.559 --> 01:47:36.992
Hide it.

947
01:47:37.159 --> 01:47:40.071
Somewhere no one
will ever be able to find it.

948
01:47:41.079 --> 01:47:42.671
Not even me.

949
01:47:46.679 --> 01:47:48.397
Always a catch.

950
01:47:49.799 --> 01:47:51.312
Yeah.

951
01:48:03.879 --> 01:48:05.631
So...

952
01:48:07.199 --> 01:48:10.111
I've got some cleaning up to do.

953
01:48:13.799 --> 01:48:15.710
I'll...

954
01:48:15.879 --> 01:48:18.074
see you around.

955
01:48:20.479 --> 01:48:22.310
I'd like that.

956
01:48:51.079 --> 01:48:53.832
<i>I guess there's a plan for all of us.</i>

957
01:48:53.999 --> 01:48:55.512
<i>I had to die</i>

958
01:48:55.679 --> 01:48:56.953
<i>twice</i>

959
01:48:57.119 --> 01:48:59.235
<i>just to figure that out.</i>

960
01:48:59.399 --> 01:49:04.189
<i>Like the Book says, He works His work
in mysterious ways.</i>

961
01:49:04.359 --> 01:49:06.429
<i>Some people like it</i>

962
01:49:06.599 --> 01:49:09.033
<i>some people don't.</i>

963
01:54:47.959 --> 01:54:49.995
You did good, kid.
