<i>Should be prosecuted.</i>

2
00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:27.650
<i>And then he doubled down on that</i>

3
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:29.401
<i>just before the election took place.</i>

4
00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:31.402
<i>And then talked about it again last week.</i>

5
00:00:31.403 --> 00:00:33.608
<i>Really extraordinary the circumstances.</i>

6
00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:36.317
<i>Remember Hillary Clinton,
Secretary Clinton,</i>

7
00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:39.608
<i>just recently came out and
said the Jim Comey letters</i>

8
00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:41.900
<i>and what he said was one of the reasons</i>

9
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:43.191
<i>she lost the election.</i>

10
00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:45.066
<i>Now we're saying that he's been fired</i>

11
00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:46.900
<i>for basically those decisions.</i>

12
00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:48.607
<i>I want to read a letter</i>

13
00:00:48.608 --> 00:00:52.565
<i>from President Trump,
uh, released just moments ago.</i>

14
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.524

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.468
This is my partner Wa...
Partner, Wally Taylor.

31
00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:10.720
Hey. How are you?

32
00:03:19.343 --> 00:03:20.968
<i>Hi.</i>

33
00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.717
Reality Winner: <i>Hey.</i>

34
00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:23.967
Wally Taylor: <i>How are you?</i>

35
00:03:23.968 --> 00:03:25.343
<i>Uh...</i>

36
00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:27.924
Good.
H-how are you doing?

37
00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:29.008
Good.

38
00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.384
How's your day today?

39
00:03:31.218 --> 00:03:34.467
Uh, it's pretty good.
Just got some groceries.

40
00:03:36.384 --> 00:03:37.549
Alright.

41
00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:44.300
Let's show you who we are.

42
00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:06.338
Okay. Well, the reason
we're here today

43
00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.005
is that we have a search
warrant for your house.

44
00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:12.628
- Okay.
- Justin Garrick: Alright.

45
00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.005
Uh, do you know
what this might be about?

46
00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:18.962
I have no idea.

47
00:04:19.296 --> 00:04:20.378
Okay.

48
00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:22.836
This is about, uh,
possible mishandling

49
00:04:22.837 --> 00:04:24.712
of classified information.

50
00:04:25.713 --> 00:04:26.837
Oh, my goodness. Okay.

51
00:04:26.838 --> 00:04:27.961
Mm-hmm.

52
00:04:28.628 --> 00:04:32.543
So what we've got is,
uh, again, g-got a warrant.

53
00:04:32.544 --> 00:04:34.002
And, uh,

54
00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:35.545
I'm happy to show it to you.

55
00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.584
<i>What I'd like to do is sit down,</i>

56
00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:40.128
<i>talk you with, uh,
talk with you about it.</i>

57
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.001
Kind of go over what,
what's going on.

58
00:04:44.002 --> 00:04:46.585
Uh, kind of get your,
your side of it.

59
00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:48.750
And, of course,
you're completely voluntary

60
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:49.834
to talk to me.

61
00:04:49.835 --> 00:04:51.917
Uh, we can talk here

62
00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:55.125
or, uh, our office is
about five minutes away,

63
00:04:55.126 --> 00:04:57.084
uh, if you want to,
if you'd rather talk there.

64
00:04:57.085 --> 00:04:58.915
Then we can do either one.

65
00:04:58.916 --> 00:05:00.459
It makes no difference to me.

66
00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:04.416
Okay.
Do you have any pets?

67
00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:07.998
- I do. I have two pets. - 'Cause
you-you've been gone a while.

68
00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:10.165
So do, do we maybe need
to let 'em out,

69
00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:12.041
use the bathroom,
stuff like that?

70
00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:13.956
I, uh, I-I do.

71
00:05:13.957 --> 00:05:16.040
Um, would you mind

72
00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:17.997
if I at least get some
perishables into the fridge?

73
00:05:17.998 --> 00:05:19.122
And we can do that, too.

74
00:05:19.123 --> 00:05:20.749
But what we're gonna
have to do is, uh...

75
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.497
Do you live by yourself?

76
00:05:25.873 --> 00:05:27.081
Yes.

77
00:05:27.082 --> 00:05:28.329
Okay. What we're
gonna have to do is

78
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.204
we're gonna have to go
into the house first,

79
00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:32.330
make sure it's, it's safe.

80
00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:35.705
We have a search warrant,
so we-we're, uh,

81
00:05:35.706 --> 00:05:37.371
we're going to.

82
00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:40.078
Absolutely.
Okay.

83
00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.495
And what we'll do is

84
00:05:41.496 --> 00:05:43.077
we'll keep you out here
until we do that

85
00:05:43.078 --> 00:05:45.162
and once we secure it,
we'll, uh...

86
00:05:45.163 --> 00:05:46.746
then we can kind of
go from there, okay?

87
00:05:46.747 --> 00:05:48.120
Of course.

88
00:05:53.578 --> 00:05:55.162
So is your dog friendly?

89
00:05:57.328 --> 00:05:59.619
Okay, well, uh, so...

90
00:06:00.578 --> 00:06:03.534
she doesn't... like men.

91
00:06:03.535 --> 00:06:05.243
- Okay.
- So...

92
00:06:05.244 --> 00:06:07.326
- So that's a problem.
- Yeah.

93
00:06:07.327 --> 00:06:10.075
- Um, she may come towards you, but...
- Okay.

94
00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:12.367
She's never bitten anybody.
She's not aggressive.

95
00:06:12.368 --> 00:06:14.408
She's just got, you know,
a really good growl going.

96
00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.617
- Okay.
- She'll probably hide under my desk.

97
00:06:16.618 --> 00:06:18.575
Do you have a, a leash or...

98
00:06:18.576 --> 00:06:19.700
- I have a leash.
- Okay.

99
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:21.285
I can, I can get her leashed up.

100
00:06:22.408 --> 00:06:24.907
So what we might want to do is
maybe let you go in there with her.

101
00:06:24.908 --> 00:06:26.116
You're not to touch
anything else.

102
00:06:26.117 --> 00:06:28.157
You're not to do anything
else but get the dog

103
00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:29.365
and bring it out here.

104
00:06:29.366 --> 00:06:31.449
- We cool? We...
- Of course. I understand.

105
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.698
Because otherwise,
if, if we have a problem,

106
00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:34.865
we're not gonna do that.

107
00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:36.574
I can move her
straight to the backyard.

108
00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:37.822
Okay.
Okay.

109
00:06:37.823 --> 00:06:39.282
Uh, house key?

110
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.781
House key.

111
00:06:44.406 --> 00:06:46.072
We also have a warrant
to search the car too.

112
00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:47.405
Do you have a cell phone?

113
00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:59.238
We'll take that, and we'll, uh,
kind of go from there, okay?

114
00:06:59.697 --> 00:07:01.988
Uh, but like he said,
we're completely voluntary,

115
00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:03.361
completely up to you on...

116
00:07:03.362 --> 00:07:05.571
But, you know, I think maybe
it'd be worth your time...

117
00:07:05.572 --> 00:07:07.360
- No, definitely. - ...to listen,
at least for a little bit.

118
00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:08.861
- Um, definitely here...
- Okay?

119
00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:09.945
And we can kind of figure out

120
00:07:09.946 --> 00:07:11.070
what's, what's going on.

121
00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:13.444
- To, uh, comply.
- Okay.

122
00:07:13.445 --> 00:07:16.069
Her leash is two feet
inside the door

123
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.194
where I left it this morning.

124
00:07:17.195 --> 00:07:19.110
I can move her
straight to the backyard.

125
00:07:19.111 --> 00:07:21.154
Are there any weapons in the car?
In the house?

126
00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:25.736
- In the house, yes.
- What do you have?

127
00:07:28.651 --> 00:07:30.444
I have an AR-15.

128
00:07:33.526 --> 00:07:34.610
Is it pink?

129
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:38.858
- It's pink.
- Okay.

130
00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:40.735
How'd you know?

131
00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:46.901
Uh, I have a Glock Nine
under the bed

132
00:07:46.902 --> 00:07:51.191
and a, uh, a 15-gauge.
Okay.

133
00:07:51.192 --> 00:07:53.023
You sound like my house.

134
00:07:53.024 --> 00:07:55.066
Okay, we're good, then.

135
00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:56.941
Alright.
Just don't make any,

136
00:07:56.942 --> 00:07:59.274
any movements for those
and then we're...

137
00:08:00.107 --> 00:08:02.107
Yeah.
Yeah.

138
00:08:02.108 --> 00:08:03.481
I mean, we're all cool.

139
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:05.690
Yeah.
Yeah.

140
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.647
I mean, kind of obvious.

141
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:10.522
Yeah.
You can put, put...

142
00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:13.230
There's a little fenced-in
area where you can put her?

143
00:08:14.148 --> 00:08:15.938
Uh, yes, yes.

144
00:08:15.939 --> 00:08:17.395
And you won't even
take your eyes off me.

145
00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:19.229
And we'll get water
and stuff like that.

146
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.897
And this other guy, uh,
is with us as well.

147
00:08:21.898 --> 00:08:23.228
And we'll probably have
a few more people

148
00:08:23.229 --> 00:08:24.730
showing up here directly.

149
00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:35.686
<i>Is that the only pet?</i>

150
00:08:35.687 --> 00:08:36.729
<i>There is a cat.</i>

151
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.727
<i>She will go
straight under the bed.</i>

152
00:08:38.728 --> 00:08:40.353
<i>Okay.</i>

153
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.269
Jen doesn't like men.

154
00:08:43.644 --> 00:08:45.060
Starting to see a trend here.

155
00:08:45.061 --> 00:08:47.269
Yeah. Y'all can come on out.
We found her.

156
00:08:47.852 --> 00:08:48.893
What's her name?

157
00:08:48.894 --> 00:08:50.810
Uh, Mickey.

158
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:51.977
Hey, Mickey.

159
00:08:51.978 --> 00:08:53.059
Hey there.

160
00:08:57.392 --> 00:08:59.435
She doesn't know
what's going on, though.

161
00:09:07.225 --> 00:09:08.725
<i>There you go.</i>

162
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.141
You don't have any weapons
or anything on you, do you?

163
00:09:20.683 --> 00:09:22.556
- No.
- None in the car?

164
00:09:22.557 --> 00:09:24.431
Um, in the car? No.

165
00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:26.475
Hey.

166
00:09:27.765 --> 00:09:29.389
Hang on.
Hang on, hang on just...

167
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.265
Can I close the door for my cat?

168
00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:34.598
Alright.

169
00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:41.473
'Cause that-that's all
I care about right now.

170
00:09:45.347 --> 00:09:48.887
Okay, uh, so the only thing
in there now that's alive

171
00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:50.013
is the cat?

172
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.970
Yes.
There's not a person?

173
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:55.263
No person.

174
00:09:56.597 --> 00:09:57.677
They're on their way?

175
00:09:57.678 --> 00:09:58.970
Yeah, they're pulling up.

176
00:10:20.844 --> 00:10:22.342
Why don't we, uh...

177
00:10:23.051 --> 00:10:25.384
Do you want to wait out here
with her for a minute?

178
00:10:25.385 --> 00:10:26.635
And Joe and I will walk through.

179
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:29.717
Again, just to explain,
we have a search warrant.

180
00:10:29.718 --> 00:10:31.092
It's...

181
00:10:31.093 --> 00:10:33.091
I-I understand.
It's en route. So...

182
00:11:16.672 --> 00:11:18.211
It's alright.

183
00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:19.961
They're just making sure, uh,
just checking to make sure

184
00:11:19.962 --> 00:11:21.712
there's nobody else in there

185
00:11:21.713 --> 00:11:23.753
or nothing... surprise!

186
00:11:23.754 --> 00:11:25.669
Surprise us
or anything like that.

187
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.460
- Yup.
- So...

188
00:11:27.461 --> 00:11:28.877
I'm gonna make this

189
00:11:28.878 --> 00:11:31.045
as easy as possible
for you guys.

190
00:11:31.046 --> 00:11:33.084
Okay. Likewise.

191
00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:35.002
So hopefully explain things,

192
00:11:35.003 --> 00:11:37.667
get to, uh, figure this all out

193
00:11:37.668 --> 00:11:39.544
and, uh, wrap it up.

194
00:11:45.835 --> 00:11:47.374
How, uh,

195
00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:48.542
how, how old is she?

196
00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.041
We don't know.
She's one of those.

197
00:11:53.042 --> 00:11:54.916
Oh yeah. Yeah.
My, uh,

198
00:11:54.917 --> 00:11:56.543
one of my dogs is a rescue.

199
00:11:57.084 --> 00:11:59.833
And when I got him,
he wouldn't, uh...

200
00:12:00.459 --> 00:12:02.623
I was the only guy
who could touch him.

201
00:12:02.624 --> 00:12:03.624
Huh?

202
00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:05.207
Anybody else came in the house,

203
00:12:05.208 --> 00:12:09.123
especially male,
he'd pee all over the place.

204
00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:10.708
But I could touch him,
and it was fine.

205
00:12:13.498 --> 00:12:16.915
So whoever had him
before was a real, uh,

206
00:12:16.916 --> 00:12:19.081
phew, real piece of work.

207
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.247
Yeah. She was left in a kennel
and neglected her whole life.

208
00:12:25.998 --> 00:12:27.704
Why don't we, uh...

209
00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:30.038
Let's get the groceries, throw
'em in the fridge real quick,

210
00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:31.748
then we'll bring you
back out here, okay?

211
00:13:18.783 --> 00:13:20.116
<i>Is that...</i>

212
00:13:20.117 --> 00:13:22.242
<i>Uh, no, that's it
for the perishables.</i>

213
00:13:24.617 --> 00:13:25.658
Should be.

214
00:13:32.282 --> 00:13:34.657
The neighbors.

215
00:13:44.364 --> 00:13:46.864
Alright. If you could
just, uh, step over.

216
00:13:46.865 --> 00:13:47.906
Just here.

217
00:13:48.405 --> 00:13:50.323
Yeah.
Just stop right there.

218
00:13:54.447 --> 00:13:55.446
Look up here.

219
00:14:03.654 --> 00:14:04.696
Just...

220
00:14:18.028 --> 00:14:20.402
There's a cat in the house,
in the bed,

221
00:14:20.403 --> 00:14:22.028
- or it's on the bed.
- On the bed?

222
00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:24.193
- Or was on the bed.
- It's...

223
00:14:24.194 --> 00:14:26.527
It-it'll probably go
under the bed at some point.

224
00:14:26.528 --> 00:14:29.402
The dog is in
the backyard in the fence.

225
00:14:31.694 --> 00:14:32.734
Does...

226
00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:37.274
does she need water?

227
00:14:37.275 --> 00:14:38.441
She'll be fine.

228
00:14:38.442 --> 00:14:40.651
She's been inside all day
with her water.

229
00:14:41.818 --> 00:14:42.941
Okay.

230
00:14:43.858 --> 00:14:46.067
Alrighty.

231
00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:48.733
Alright.

232
00:14:48.734 --> 00:14:50.524
So would you like to talk here

233
00:14:50.525 --> 00:14:52.439
or talk, uh,

234
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.524
talk at the office?

235
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.107
Uh, we can go ahead
and talk here.

236
00:14:56.108 --> 00:14:57.773
Do you want to talk here?

237
00:14:57.774 --> 00:14:59.647
- Sure.
- Okay.

238
00:14:59.648 --> 00:15:01.399
Uh, let's, uh...

239
00:15:02.814 --> 00:15:04.773
I'm trying to think
if we have any

240
00:15:04.774 --> 00:15:07.271
private place, uh,
there in the house that...

241
00:15:07.272 --> 00:15:08.688
D-do you have anything
there in the house

242
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:10.981
that we can kind of sit
that's away...

243
00:15:13.355 --> 00:15:14.647
Away?

244
00:15:21.439 --> 00:15:23.853
There's one bedroom
that's empty.

245
00:15:23.854 --> 00:15:26.146
I don't...

246
00:15:26.147 --> 00:15:29.396
I-I don't, I don't really like
to go in there...

247
00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:32.519
other than...

248
00:15:33.395 --> 00:15:36.853
I guess I don't really have
anything else other than that,

249
00:15:36.854 --> 00:15:38.518
that back room.

250
00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:39.603
That back room?

251
00:15:42.187 --> 00:15:45.143
Okay. And it's, uh,
it's completely empty?

252
00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:46.394
Yeah. You'll go in there.

253
00:15:46.395 --> 00:15:47.601
There's, uh,

254
00:15:47.602 --> 00:15:49.477
there's one dog kennel cage.

255
00:15:50.102 --> 00:15:51.852
Other than that, I don't use it.

256
00:15:51.853 --> 00:15:53.933
Okay. Alright. Um,

257
00:15:53.934 --> 00:15:57.059
y-y-you said you don't like
to go in there. But, uh...

258
00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.683
Oh, gosh.
No, it's just... weird.

259
00:15:59.684 --> 00:16:00.892
It's just creepy.

260
00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.143
It's like an addition to the,

261
00:16:02.641 --> 00:16:04.099
the back of the house
behind the kitchen,

262
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.392
and it's always dirty.

263
00:16:06.393 --> 00:16:07.474
Okay. Alright.

264
00:16:07.475 --> 00:16:08.891
We, we can talk back there

265
00:16:08.892 --> 00:16:10.434
if, if you're fine
going back there.

266
00:16:11.392 --> 00:16:13.723
- It's, uh...
- Yeah, we can go back there.

267
00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:17.514
Okay. Alright. There's a,
uh, there's a back room there

268
00:16:17.515 --> 00:16:19.015
that we can... Kind
of like the laundry?

269
00:16:19.016 --> 00:16:20.015
That she'd like to talk in.

270
00:16:20.016 --> 00:16:21.682
Yeah, that'll work.

271
00:16:21.683 --> 00:16:23.097
It's too hot out here for...

272
00:16:23.098 --> 00:16:24.264
Oh, well, I can make a pitstop

273
00:16:24.265 --> 00:16:27.057
and take out the AC
if you need that.

274
00:16:27.848 --> 00:16:29.847
Well, there's,
they've gotta do their thing

275
00:16:29.848 --> 00:16:30.972
for a minute,
and then we can go in.

276
00:16:30.973 --> 00:16:31.932
We can go in.

277
00:16:31.933 --> 00:16:33.347
Oh, get the password.

278
00:16:33.348 --> 00:16:35.138
Oh, what's the, uh,
how do you open this?

279
00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:36.556
- Uh...
- Just hang on.

280
00:16:38.013 --> 00:16:40.097
What kind is it?
An iPhone?

281
00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:09.094
How long you lived in Augusta?

282
00:17:10.886 --> 00:17:13.592
Uh... I was out here

283
00:17:13.593 --> 00:17:17.718
October 2015 to April 2016,

284
00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:21.510
um, TDY, and then moved back
this past December.

285
00:17:21.719 --> 00:17:23.551
What do...
What do you think of it?

286
00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:26.842
Well, I willingly moved
back here as a civilian,

287
00:17:26.843 --> 00:17:28.049
so I guess it must be alright.

288
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.175
Willingly.

289
00:17:29.176 --> 00:17:30.734
You say that,
you say that begrudgingly.

290
00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:33.841
Yeah. I, I mean,
originally, I...

291
00:17:34.175 --> 00:17:37.007
My big plan is to deploy
as a Pashto linguist

292
00:17:37.008 --> 00:17:38.298
and be in Bagram for a bit.

293
00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:41.007
But then they hired me
out here for Farsi, so...

294
00:17:41.008 --> 00:17:42.881
Wait, you're-you're
Farsi and Pashto?

295
00:17:42.882 --> 00:17:44.965
Farsi, Dari, Pashto.

296
00:17:44.966 --> 00:17:46.632
Wow! That's...

297
00:17:46.633 --> 00:17:48.506
that's impressive.

298
00:17:49.132 --> 00:17:51.925
I can barely, I-I'm barely
able to speak English.

299
00:17:53.547 --> 00:17:54.548
English is hard.

300
00:17:55.715 --> 00:17:56.924
Hmm.

301
00:17:58.214 --> 00:18:00.340
Uh, but yeah,
I noticed that with...

302
00:18:04.047 --> 00:18:05.713
Especially here at Augusta,

303
00:18:05.714 --> 00:18:07.171
it's, uh,
it's great for families.

304
00:18:07.172 --> 00:18:10.296
But, uh, single, it's,
it's kind of tough.

305
00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:14.045
Like, I can't imagine
coming back.

306
00:18:14.046 --> 00:18:15.671
What's the, um...

307
00:18:16.005 --> 00:18:18.502
Do you, uh, do you have
a password or anything?

308
00:18:18.503 --> 00:18:20.920
- No password.
- How do we, how do we do it?

309
00:18:20.921 --> 00:18:22.418
Show me how to do it
or tell me how to do it.

310
00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:23.543
Swipe that?

311
00:18:23.544 --> 00:18:25.085
Uh, yeah.

312
00:18:25.086 --> 00:18:26.378
No security?

313
00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:28.127
No security.

314
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:31.294
You don't have a password
or anything that...

315
00:18:31.295 --> 00:18:33.584
No password. Nothing.
Just anytime it locks,

316
00:18:33.585 --> 00:18:36.418
- you just press the side there...
- Okay.

317
00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:38.960
Until you see the circle
and just slide up a bit.

318
00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:41.211
Okay, so it...

319
00:18:44.168 --> 00:18:45.627
Did you already show her
the warrant?

320
00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.459
Uh, no, I haven't.

321
00:18:50.959 --> 00:18:53.958
I was going to. We're going to, we're
going to sit down and show it to her.

322
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.041
What made you
get out of the Air Force?

323
00:19:13.539 --> 00:19:16.041
I, I wanted to deploy.

324
00:19:16.956 --> 00:19:19.371
I mean, I learned Pashto
for a reason

325
00:19:19.372 --> 00:19:21.706
and those opportunities aren't
in the Air Force right now.

326
00:19:21.707 --> 00:19:22.954
Mm.

327
00:19:22.955 --> 00:19:24.246
You figure that
with that language,

328
00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:26.122
you could just
raise your hand and they'd go,

329
00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:27.871
- Right here!
- "Yeah, go."

330
00:19:28.371 --> 00:19:30.246
Yeah. No.
Where I was in Maryland,

331
00:19:30.247 --> 00:19:32.286
they only had one billet
per year for Afghanistan,

332
00:19:32.287 --> 00:19:34.412
and it was all always airborne.

333
00:19:34.413 --> 00:19:35.830
Not even language.

334
00:19:36.164 --> 00:19:38.078
So I imagine people
are just crawling for it.

335
00:19:38.621 --> 00:19:41.413
Yeah. And I don't have
my airborne physical. So...

336
00:19:43.412 --> 00:19:44.828
Is your dog okay?

337
00:19:44.829 --> 00:19:46.704
- Does it need anything?
- She's fine.

338
00:19:47.162 --> 00:19:49.160
- She?
- Yeah, she's...

339
00:19:49.161 --> 00:19:51.329
If you can tell
we're all dog people.

340
00:19:53.786 --> 00:19:55.369
Yeah, I can, I can tell.

341
00:20:01.203 --> 00:20:02.408
Is she destructive at all

342
00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:04.326
when she, when you
leave her alone?

343
00:20:04.327 --> 00:20:06.910
Yeah, she's just
a nervous chewer.

344
00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:10.909
Whoa!

345
00:20:28.157 --> 00:20:29.491
Where do you CrossFit at?

346
00:20:32.074 --> 00:20:35.574
Uh, I'm at SEC.

347
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.822
It used to be
on, uh, Enterprise Court...

348
00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:41.073
- Mm-hmm.
- off of Bobby Jones,

349
00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:43.031
and then we moved to Wheeler.

350
00:20:45.323 --> 00:20:48.196
Uh, but my-my friend's
reopening the Under Box.

351
00:20:48.197 --> 00:20:50.946
You, you going to go off?

352
00:20:50.947 --> 00:20:52.653
Yeah. I'm just, I'm just
waiting for her gym

353
00:20:52.654 --> 00:20:54.322
to open to, to jump ship.

354
00:20:56.447 --> 00:20:57.986
I did it for, like, six months,

355
00:20:57.987 --> 00:20:59.278
and I hurt myself.

356
00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:02.153
- Oh.
- Just every single day was just pain.

357
00:21:02.154 --> 00:21:03.861
- Yeah.
- So, I don't know.

358
00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:05.988
I guess I'm just too old
and broken.

359
00:21:10.321 --> 00:21:12.860
Yeah, I always say that
I, I don't do CrossFit,

360
00:21:12.861 --> 00:21:14.235
I do competitive powerlifting.
Okay.

361
00:21:14.236 --> 00:21:16.153
And then I do CrossFit
when it's convenient.

362
00:21:16.154 --> 00:21:17.486
No. Uh-huh.

363
00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:20.610
What's your, uh...

364
00:21:20.611 --> 00:21:22.027
Powerlifting?

365
00:21:23.777 --> 00:21:25.818
What's your,
y-your preference on?

366
00:21:25.819 --> 00:21:27.691
What's your favorite stuff?

367
00:21:27.692 --> 00:21:31.110
Oh, I'm just all upper body.

368
00:21:31.653 --> 00:21:33.150
So, bench.

369
00:21:33.151 --> 00:21:35.108
It's kind of sad.
I tested my lifts this week

370
00:21:35.109 --> 00:21:36.983
because I have a competition
on June 24th,

371
00:21:36.984 --> 00:21:40.983
and my max bench is 180,
and then my max back squat...

372
00:21:40.984 --> 00:21:42.815
I have a, I have a back injury,

373
00:21:42.816 --> 00:21:45.066
so my max back squat is 195.

374
00:21:45.067 --> 00:21:46.940
- But I don't...
- Still!

375
00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:48.357
Still not shabby.

376
00:21:48.358 --> 00:21:50.523
No, it should not be that close.

377
00:21:50.524 --> 00:21:52.190
How'd you hurt your back?

378
00:21:54.483 --> 00:21:56.273
Uh, doing power cleans.

379
00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:59.022
My, uh, pelvis wasn't rotating,

380
00:21:59.023 --> 00:22:01.607
so I separated that joint.

381
00:22:01.608 --> 00:22:03.231
Sounds painful.
Yeah.

382
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.773
I did, um, I was doing box jumps

383
00:22:05.774 --> 00:22:07.147
and this hand just...

384
00:22:07.148 --> 00:22:10.022
I was doing it by myself.
It hit the box.

385
00:22:10.023 --> 00:22:13.687
And, I-I mean, I thought
I just fractured every bone

386
00:22:13.688 --> 00:22:16.855
in the body,
in the, in the hand.

387
00:22:17.438 --> 00:22:20.063
And I went to, I had to go
to the doctor to get the x-ray.

388
00:22:20.064 --> 00:22:22.770
They said, "So how did
you do this?" CrossFit.

389
00:22:22.771 --> 00:22:24.604
Four times they asked me.

390
00:22:24.605 --> 00:22:27.228
I said, "No, I didn't get
in a fight. It was CrossFit."

391
00:22:30.021 --> 00:22:31.354
I, I, um, I thought I could see

392
00:22:31.355 --> 00:22:33.477
the bone on my shin
from that one.

393
00:22:33.478 --> 00:22:35.019
Wow. What was that?

394
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.477
Box jumps.
Just missed the box.

395
00:22:37.478 --> 00:22:39.810
That's a moment you really
hope, did anybody see that?

396
00:22:39.811 --> 00:22:42.019
I really hope nobody saw that.

397
00:22:58.975 --> 00:23:01.518
So I do have to ask just

398
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.350
however this goes, and I don't
want to make any assumptions,

399
00:23:05.351 --> 00:23:08.766
but this is going to be
a thing where, like,

400
00:23:08.767 --> 00:23:10.225
I brought my phone
into the building

401
00:23:10.226 --> 00:23:12.516
and I don't see that phone
for three weeks or...

402
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.474
- So, we'll go over the...
- So, we have a warrant for the phone.

403
00:23:15.475 --> 00:23:16.766
Yeah, no, and I don't,
I don't want to make

404
00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:18.306
any assumptions
or anything like that.

405
00:23:18.307 --> 00:23:19.432
Just, uh...

406
00:23:20.099 --> 00:23:23.139
I'm, I'm teaching yoga tomorrow,

407
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.182
and my phone has
the music on it.

408
00:23:33.805 --> 00:23:35.181
Okay.

409
00:23:36.598 --> 00:23:39.721
I mean, there are...
bigger problems in the world.

410
00:23:39.722 --> 00:23:41.597
So I, I can make do, I guess.

411
00:23:41.598 --> 00:23:45.680
Yeah. And, uh, we'll, we'll talk
about that once we sit down.

412
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.928
Is there, uh, do you have
just a few chairs?

413
00:23:48.929 --> 00:23:51.471
Like, kitchen table chairs
we can pull into that,

414
00:23:51.472 --> 00:23:54.094
that back room or are we
gonna be sitting on the floor?

415
00:23:54.095 --> 00:23:56.012
No. Uh...

416
00:23:56.596 --> 00:24:01.137
yeah, if you want to sit.
I'm not too big on furniture.

417
00:24:54.798 --> 00:24:56.631
Would it be too much
to ask if I can get

418
00:24:56.632 --> 00:24:58.463
the cat on a leash and tied up?

419
00:24:58.464 --> 00:25:00.255
Just, um...

420
00:25:01.714 --> 00:25:04.587
I just don't want to be, like,
asking someone in the FBI

421
00:25:04.588 --> 00:25:07.836
to keep the front door closed
if you guys are doing a search.

422
00:25:07.837 --> 00:25:09.921
I don't see,
I don't see an issue.

423
00:25:09.922 --> 00:25:13.169
Uh, uh, where is
the cat right now?

424
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:14.669
- In the bedroom.
- Uh, on the bed.

425
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:15.796
In the bed.

426
00:25:15.797 --> 00:25:18.669
- Okay.
- Still in the bed?

427
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:19.669
Yeah, I think so.

428
00:25:27.502 --> 00:25:29.960
Where... um,
just safety's sake,

429
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:32.292
where are the, uh... there's
your weapon and the...

430
00:25:32.293 --> 00:25:34.293
The weapon, it's right by
the little table

431
00:25:34.294 --> 00:25:36.252
with the lamp
right under the bed.

432
00:25:36.753 --> 00:25:38.084
Your cat's under there.

433
00:25:38.085 --> 00:25:40.710
He's under the bed,
or she's under the bed.

434
00:25:41.378 --> 00:25:43.124
The AR is in the case in here?

435
00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:43.918
Yes.

436
00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:45.250
Where's the other gun?

437
00:25:45.251 --> 00:25:46.875
It's behind it,
more against the wall

438
00:25:46.876 --> 00:25:47.957
in the black case.

439
00:25:47.958 --> 00:25:49.541
Can you get your cat?

440
00:25:49.542 --> 00:25:51.292
Do you want to get your cat?
Can you...

441
00:25:51.293 --> 00:25:52.624
Do you want to get your cat?

442
00:25:52.625 --> 00:25:53.749
Do you want to get your cat?

443
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.042
Just... Get your cat.

444
00:26:23.538 --> 00:26:25.455
<i>Alright. She's good.</i>

445
00:26:25.456 --> 00:26:27.829
(sighs) <i>Okay.</i>
<i>Alright.</i>

446
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.245
<i>Uh, you wanna go back here?</i>

447
00:26:30.246 --> 00:26:32.579
<i>Yeah, you can go ahead
and go back in there.</i>

448
00:27:13.325 --> 00:27:15.992
This room is dirty.
I'm so sorry.

449
00:27:29.658 --> 00:27:30.991
Alrighty.

450
00:27:32.948 --> 00:27:35.823
So, uh, again,
my name is Justin.

451
00:27:36.366 --> 00:27:38.280
You probably don't re-remember
any idea of who I am.

452
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:41.324
So, Justin Garrick with the FBI.

453
00:27:41.781 --> 00:27:44.156
Uh, this is Wally.
He's my partner.

454
00:27:44.781 --> 00:27:46.489
Um, so what I want to do
is kind of explain

455
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.613
that, you know, we do have
a search warrant.

456
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.655
Uh, you're welcome
to see the warrant.

457
00:27:50.656 --> 00:27:52.071
You're welcome
to read the warrant.

458
00:27:52.072 --> 00:27:53.737
And then explain
a little bit about it.

459
00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:56.697
Now, if you're willing
to talk to me,

460
00:27:57.195 --> 00:28:00.028
I'd like to kind of go through
just how this started

461
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:02.444
and, you know,
give your, your side of it.

462
00:28:02.445 --> 00:28:04.319
We'll figure out
what's going on here.

463
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.319
Does that sound, uh,
sound good to you?

464
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:10.862
Okay.

465
00:28:12.361 --> 00:28:13.444
Okay?

466
00:28:15.695 --> 00:28:16.986
Yes.

467
00:28:18.528 --> 00:28:20.194
Now I'm gonna take, uh...

468
00:28:21.777 --> 00:28:22.777
Right here.

469
00:28:23.151 --> 00:28:25.486
I'm gonna take, uh, notes,

470
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:27.816
uh, just random basis.

471
00:28:27.817 --> 00:28:28.859
You gotta take notes.

472
00:28:33.651 --> 00:28:34.900
Now, do you need water
or anything?

473
00:28:34.901 --> 00:28:36.610
Ar-are you thirsty?

474
00:28:39.359 --> 00:28:41.318
You're what? If you need
water, shout it out.

475
00:28:43.191 --> 00:28:46.400
Uh... okay.
I'll let you know. Thanks.

476
00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.689
Are you thirsty?

477
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.149
Uh, not right now.

478
00:28:50.358 --> 00:28:51.857
Okay. Alright.

479
00:28:54.107 --> 00:28:55.565
Um, if you need
to use the restroom,

480
00:28:55.566 --> 00:28:56.607
any of that, let me know.

481
00:28:56.608 --> 00:28:58.773
It's not a big deal. Okay?

482
00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.772
Okay. So currently,
you're employed

483
00:29:01.773 --> 00:29:04.480
as a contract, uh, linguist

484
00:29:04.481 --> 00:29:06.524
with Pluribus?

485
00:29:07.104 --> 00:29:08.104
Yes.

486
00:29:08.105 --> 00:29:10.355
I'm sorry, what languages
you said?

487
00:29:10.356 --> 00:29:11.522
Um, I-I heard...

488
00:29:11.523 --> 00:29:13.480
Uh, Farsi, Dari, Pashto.

489
00:29:17.521 --> 00:29:18.770
Okay.

490
00:29:18.771 --> 00:29:20.230
Any other?

491
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.605
No.

492
00:29:26.687 --> 00:29:27.978
I think that's enough.

493
00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.812
That's really impressive.

494
00:29:30.813 --> 00:29:33.478
Uh, and you live here,
uh, sorry, by yourself?

495
00:29:34.937 --> 00:29:37.268
Yes.
Okay.

496
00:29:38.936 --> 00:29:41.145
It's really hard
without a table and chairs.

497
00:29:43.102 --> 00:29:45.311
- I-I'm so sorry.
- It's...

498
00:29:45.936 --> 00:29:48.102
You don't have to apol...
It's your house.

499
00:29:49.143 --> 00:29:51.018
Um, if you do feel like,
you know,

500
00:29:51.019 --> 00:29:53.058
you want to sit
or anything, we'll sit.

501
00:29:53.059 --> 00:29:54.809
Okay? I mean,
if you sit on the floor,

502
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.059
I'll sit on the floor,
I don't care.

503
00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.475
Hmm?
Mm-hmm.

504
00:29:58.767 --> 00:30:00.017
Okay.

505
00:30:01.143 --> 00:30:02.807
Um, and I'm serious about that.

506
00:30:02.808 --> 00:30:03.808
If you want to sit, please.

507
00:30:03.809 --> 00:30:05.351
I'll, I'll sit down too.

508
00:30:07.432 --> 00:30:08.807
Okay.

509
00:30:08.808 --> 00:30:10.516
Um, so, again.

510
00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:12.390
We have a warrant,

511
00:30:12.391 --> 00:30:13.807
and it's...
do you...

512
00:30:13.808 --> 00:30:15.558
Would you like to see it?

513
00:30:16.642 --> 00:30:18.973
Yes, please.
Okay.

514
00:30:21.349 --> 00:30:22.930
That just gave us
the authority to search

515
00:30:22.931 --> 00:30:24.973
the residence,
the car, and then you.

516
00:30:33.764 --> 00:30:36.598
125 pounds.
You guys flatter me.

517
00:30:39.639 --> 00:30:41.471
Sorry, I have a sense of humor.

518
00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:44.221
That was on your driver's license.
That's right.

519
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.637
Okay, well, I lied.

520
00:30:48.762 --> 00:30:50.262
Don't we all?

521
00:30:52.261 --> 00:30:54.678
Attachment "B"
just explains the property

522
00:30:54.679 --> 00:30:56.761
that we're authorized
to search for and seize.

523
00:30:56.762 --> 00:30:58.469
Any questions about any of that?

524
00:31:00.553 --> 00:31:01.553
Um...

525
00:31:04.427 --> 00:31:05.470
No.

526
00:31:05.678 --> 00:31:06.677
Okay.

527
00:31:07.134 --> 00:31:09.177
We'll just leave
a copy of that for you.

528
00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:11.302
Yeah, we'll leave a copy.

529
00:31:49.715 --> 00:31:51.214
<i>So, uh,</i>

530
00:31:51.215 --> 00:31:53.588
<i>all this stems from
a report that we received</i>

531
00:31:53.589 --> 00:31:56.590
<i>that you had mishandled
classified information.</i>

532
00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.921
<i>Uh, my, uh, question is,</i>

533
00:31:59.922 --> 00:32:02.338
<i>does that ring any bells
to you whatsoever?</i>

534
00:32:09.004 --> 00:32:12.086
It-it does now. Um...

535
00:32:12.087 --> 00:32:15.046
When I started working
at White Law, I...

536
00:32:16.878 --> 00:32:18.962
Do you guys know PKI passwords?
Mm-hmm.

537
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.001
So I had a printed-out email,
and I put it in a folder.

538
00:32:23.002 --> 00:32:25.585
I didn't have a desk yet,
so I, I took it with me

539
00:32:25.586 --> 00:32:28.168
and passed through security
and went to Starbucks.

540
00:32:28.169 --> 00:32:31.918
And when I came back,
they searched through it.

541
00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:33.417
And unfortunately,

542
00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:36.043
the email I had printed out
was classified,

543
00:32:36.044 --> 00:32:37.917
and, uh, they, they
filed a report for that.

544
00:32:37.918 --> 00:32:39.251
Okay. Alright.

545
00:32:39.252 --> 00:32:40.918
And, uh, what's
your work role there

546
00:32:40.919 --> 00:32:42.043
at, at White Law?

547
00:32:42.459 --> 00:32:46.502
Currently, I translate
graphics documents, and, um...

548
00:32:48.209 --> 00:32:50.292
Yeah, that's all I do.
Okay.

549
00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:52.042
From Farsi to English.

550
00:32:52.874 --> 00:32:56.083
So you're assigned
to a specific section,

551
00:32:56.084 --> 00:32:57.414
I guess, or group?
Yes.

552
00:32:57.415 --> 00:33:00.582
Uh, it's the Iranian
Aerospace Forces Office.

553
00:33:00.583 --> 00:33:03.165
Have you been assigned there
your entire time there?

554
00:33:03.541 --> 00:33:05.083
Yes, since February.

555
00:33:06.583 --> 00:33:07.622
Okay.

556
00:33:07.623 --> 00:33:08.997
Uh, is there any other issues

557
00:33:08.998 --> 00:33:10.915
or anything you're aware of
that might explain

558
00:33:10.916 --> 00:33:12.704
why that report was generated?

559
00:33:12.705 --> 00:33:15.873
Like, ah, maybe this,
maybe that.

560
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.081
No.

561
00:33:19.498 --> 00:33:20.581
No. Okay.

562
00:33:21.082 --> 00:33:24.746
Um, so you currently hold
Top Secret/SCI clearance?

563
00:33:24.747 --> 00:33:26.081
Yes.

564
00:33:27.246 --> 00:33:29.870
How long have you had that?

565
00:33:29.871 --> 00:33:34.663
Uh, I would say
since January 2013.

566
00:33:34.996 --> 00:33:37.203
While you were in the Air Force?
Yes.

567
00:33:38.453 --> 00:33:39.954
So you kept it through...

568
00:33:42.411 --> 00:33:43.453
through the...

569
00:33:44.203 --> 00:33:45.287
Did you...

570
00:33:46.454 --> 00:33:49.410
<i>I guess when you left the
Air Force, you kept the...</i>

571
00:33:49.411 --> 00:33:50.453
<i>When did you lea...</i>

572
00:33:51.078 --> 00:33:53.201
When did you process
out of the Air Force?

573
00:33:53.202 --> 00:33:55.701
Uh, I processed out
of the Air Force,

574
00:33:55.702 --> 00:33:57.826
um, December,

575
00:33:57.827 --> 00:34:01.867
uh, December 14th, um, 2016.

576
00:34:01.868 --> 00:34:04.367
And up until that time,
I was looking for contracts

577
00:34:04.368 --> 00:34:06.284
to try and get
my clearance renewed.

578
00:34:06.285 --> 00:34:08.783
So your, uh, clearance
just kind of passed through?

579
00:34:08.784 --> 00:34:10.493
It passed through. Yeah.

580
00:34:12.991 --> 00:34:14.408
Okay. Alright.

581
00:34:14.784 --> 00:34:18.281
Um, so, again,
as far as you're aware,

582
00:34:18.282 --> 00:34:20.616
you haven't committed
any security violations

583
00:34:20.617 --> 00:34:21.990
or anything you're aware of

584
00:34:21.991 --> 00:34:23.865
other than this, this

585
00:34:23.866 --> 00:34:25.949
PKI thing?

586
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:29.282
Other than the PKI thing, no.

587
00:34:36.698 --> 00:34:37.989
I mean...

588
00:34:39.365 --> 00:34:43.196
I-I do print out
documents at work

589
00:34:43.197 --> 00:34:46.737
because it's easier for me
to translate them by hand.

590
00:34:46.738 --> 00:34:49.196
Hmm. But then I put
them in the box,

591
00:34:49.197 --> 00:34:50.905
and then I don't get it mixed up

592
00:34:50.906 --> 00:34:52.861
with, like, my,
my classified notes

593
00:34:52.862 --> 00:34:54.321
because they, uh...

594
00:34:55.947 --> 00:34:58.529
I use pretty paper.

595
00:34:59.154 --> 00:35:01.363
<i>So I don't take out white paper.</i>

596
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.278
Mm. Got it.

597
00:35:05.862 --> 00:35:07.276
An-and I know it sounds
really dumb,

598
00:35:07.277 --> 00:35:10.986
but it's just, uh,
it's how I can do it now.

599
00:35:11.445 --> 00:35:14.527
And after this stupid
PKI thing, I was like,

600
00:35:14.528 --> 00:35:17.317
no more white paper
out of the building.

601
00:35:17.318 --> 00:35:20.360
You, you said
you printed out stuff.

602
00:35:20.361 --> 00:35:21.734
Yeah, I printed out...

603
00:35:21.735 --> 00:35:23.234
Is there a, a...

604
00:35:23.235 --> 00:35:26.152
why did that come to mind
as far as security?

605
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.360
I guess

606
00:35:31.984 --> 00:35:34.484
I'm, um, just trying
to think about

607
00:35:35.609 --> 00:35:36.817
actual paper.

608
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.441
Um, I can't imagine
any other way

609
00:35:39.442 --> 00:35:42.108
to get things out
of the building, I guess.

610
00:35:42.399 --> 00:35:46.066
I mean, I-I'm old fashioned,
so thinking about that.

611
00:35:46.067 --> 00:35:50.148
And just with this PKI thing,

612
00:35:50.149 --> 00:35:51.856
just making sure I don't
accidentally have anything

613
00:35:51.857 --> 00:35:53.398
in my lunch box
or anything like...

614
00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:55.231
Nothing got out of the building?
Nothing.

615
00:35:55.232 --> 00:35:57.063
You didn't carry anything
out of the building?

616
00:35:57.064 --> 00:36:00.272
No. No. And I definitely let
everything get searched all the time.

617
00:36:00.273 --> 00:36:02.855
So I haven't had
any other accidents.

618
00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:07.271
Do you work
on any other matters?

619
00:36:07.689 --> 00:36:08.605
No.

620
00:36:08.606 --> 00:36:09.939
Okay.

621
00:36:11.147 --> 00:36:14.229
Have you ever inadvertently,
either by accident

622
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.397
or, or intentionally
or whatever,

623
00:36:16.398 --> 00:36:20.271
uh, gone outside your
need to know on items?

624
00:36:20.814 --> 00:36:24.144
Outside my
need to know on items?

625
00:36:24.145 --> 00:36:25.270
Um...

626
00:36:26.728 --> 00:36:28.894
I do from time to time

627
00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:30.937
look at a website
called My Online.

628
00:36:31.312 --> 00:36:34.268
It's, uh, drone feeds.
Okay.

629
00:36:34.269 --> 00:36:37.851
I used to work a drone mission,
so it's all Afghan stuff.

630
00:36:37.852 --> 00:36:40.853
But other than that, just, uh...

631
00:36:41.894 --> 00:36:44.518
reading basic
news articles on NSA Net.

632
00:36:44.519 --> 00:36:46.684
But I've never accessed
anything that's outside of...

633
00:36:46.685 --> 00:36:49.809
Okay. Have you ever
gone searching for stuff

634
00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:52.975
that's not related to your,
uh, your work role?

635
00:36:52.976 --> 00:36:54.101
No.

636
00:36:54.685 --> 00:36:56.060
Okay.

637
00:36:58.141 --> 00:36:59.474
You kind of already
answered this.

638
00:36:59.475 --> 00:37:03.723
But outside of the PKI,
have you ever taken anything

639
00:37:03.724 --> 00:37:06.557
outside of the,
uh, uh, the NSA facility?

640
00:37:06.558 --> 00:37:08.306
No.
No?

641
00:37:08.307 --> 00:37:10.974
Uh, have you downloaded anything?
Emailed anything out?

642
00:37:10.975 --> 00:37:13.348
No.
No? Okay.

643
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:16.015
Have you ever discussed,
uh, any classified material

644
00:37:16.016 --> 00:37:17.222
with anybody who wouldn't have

645
00:37:17.223 --> 00:37:19.514
the, uh, prior
US government authorization?

646
00:37:19.515 --> 00:37:21.390
Who wouldn't have the clearance
or anything like that?

647
00:37:21.391 --> 00:37:23.555
Who wouldn't have the clearance
and the need to know?

648
00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:24.932
No.

649
00:37:25.598 --> 00:37:28.055
No? Okay.

650
00:37:28.722 --> 00:37:31.763
Not many people ask
about Iranian aerospace,

651
00:37:31.764 --> 00:37:34.264
so, uh... I lucked out.

652
00:37:34.889 --> 00:37:36.720
So you never discussed,
uh, discussed work

653
00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:38.554
or anything classified
with anybody?

654
00:37:41.222 --> 00:37:42.262
Uh-uh.

655
00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:46.554
How's the neighborhood?

656
00:37:50.388 --> 00:37:53.010
I, I did not look at a map
when I signed the lease.

657
00:37:53.011 --> 00:37:56.053
But I am well armed.

658
00:37:56.054 --> 00:37:57.968
You seem to be.

659
00:37:57.969 --> 00:37:59.426
What's your plans?

660
00:37:59.427 --> 00:38:00.719
You gonna stay in the house

661
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.843
or you gonna move
somewhere else or...

662
00:38:01.844 --> 00:38:03.717
Di-did you sign
a lease, I guess?

663
00:38:03.718 --> 00:38:05.885
I signed a lease,
and I would only break it

664
00:38:05.886 --> 00:38:06.884
if I get a deployment.

665
00:38:06.885 --> 00:38:08.093
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

666
00:38:08.593 --> 00:38:11.717
Have you had any issues here
since you moved here?

667
00:38:11.718 --> 00:38:13.425
I did, yeah.

668
00:38:13.426 --> 00:38:14.552
What happened?

669
00:38:15.134 --> 00:38:19.008
I was coming home from a concert
in Atlanta and it was 3:00 a.m.,

670
00:38:19.009 --> 00:38:23.840
and, uh, there was a, a guy
standing on the street.

671
00:38:23.841 --> 00:38:26.425
And I wanted to make sure
that he didn't see me go

672
00:38:26.426 --> 00:38:27.882
from like my car to my, my door.

673
00:38:27.883 --> 00:38:29.507
And I thought
I'd timed it out well.

674
00:38:29.508 --> 00:38:31.924
But then I was standing
at the sink getting water

675
00:38:31.925 --> 00:38:34.322
and then someone starts knocking
at the door and I was like...

676
00:38:36.133 --> 00:38:38.423
Do you have a toothpick?
Huh?

677
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.880
Uh, it's, uh, 3:00 a.m.,

678
00:38:46.881 --> 00:38:50.214
and, uh, my-my-my keys
and my phone were by the door

679
00:38:50.215 --> 00:38:51.839
'cause that's where
I dropped them,

680
00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.548
'cause I had to pee, so, uh,

681
00:38:54.381 --> 00:38:57.045
very glad to have a,
a Glock Nine in the back.

682
00:38:57.046 --> 00:38:58.379
Oh, yeah.

683
00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.256
Did not sleep.

684
00:38:59.257 --> 00:39:00.589
I'm sure.

685
00:39:02.088 --> 00:39:03.796
Anything other than that?

686
00:39:05.505 --> 00:39:07.962
Other than that? Um...

687
00:39:09.546 --> 00:39:10.879
There's this...

688
00:39:11.421 --> 00:39:15.128
People always ask
if you want your lawn done.

689
00:39:15.129 --> 00:39:17.752
And, uh, someone came
and mowed my lawn

690
00:39:17.753 --> 00:39:19.211
while I was in Belize last week,

691
00:39:19.212 --> 00:39:21.669
so, uh, not really cool
with that.

692
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:23.418
- I imagine not.
- Yeah.

693
00:39:23.419 --> 00:39:24.669
They're probably gonna come by,

694
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.086
knock on the door,
and ask for compensation.

695
00:39:26.087 --> 00:39:27.501
Yeah.

696
00:39:27.502 --> 00:39:28.709
I mean, if it's the same guy

697
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:29.876
I paid last time,

698
00:39:29.877 --> 00:39:31.751
he's like this little old man,

699
00:39:31.752 --> 00:39:34.543
like, in his 80s,
so I won't really be mad.

700
00:39:34.544 --> 00:39:36.625
- But...
- When, uh,

701
00:39:36.626 --> 00:39:38.459
when did you go to Belize?

702
00:39:40.001 --> 00:39:43.541
I left on Saturday morning
and flew back

703
00:39:43.542 --> 00:39:45.126
Monday morning, uh,

704
00:39:45.876 --> 00:39:47.166
last weekend.

705
00:39:48.667 --> 00:39:49.906
That was a quick trip to Belize.

706
00:39:52.582 --> 00:39:54.083
It was a quick trip.

707
00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:56.041
What you go down there for?

708
00:39:56.042 --> 00:39:59.456
I wanted to see
the Mayan pyramids.

709
00:39:59.457 --> 00:40:00.582
Okay.

710
00:40:00.583 --> 00:40:02.163
<i>So, yeah.</i>

711
00:40:02.164 --> 00:40:03.956
<i>That's pretty cool.</i>

712
00:40:03.957 --> 00:40:05.498
I-I didn't have any leave,

713
00:40:05.499 --> 00:40:08.997
so I was tired of waiting
for the stars to align.

714
00:40:08.998 --> 00:40:11.039
So I just said...
Sure.

715
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.663
Got three days,
let's do it.

716
00:40:12.664 --> 00:40:13.996
That's cool.
Fair enough.

717
00:40:13.997 --> 00:40:16.082
Spur of the moment,
that's pretty cool.

718
00:40:17.038 --> 00:40:19.081
Did you go down there
by yourself or...

719
00:40:19.747 --> 00:40:21.913
Yeah, by myself.

720
00:40:21.914 --> 00:40:23.703
Okay. Did you

721
00:40:23.704 --> 00:40:25.872
do any tours or anything
down there?

722
00:40:26.496 --> 00:40:27.537
I did.

723
00:40:27.538 --> 00:40:29.662
Um, I...

724
00:40:29.663 --> 00:40:31.787
The, the first day,
I went on, like,

725
00:40:31.788 --> 00:40:34.036
a Altun Ha tour.

726
00:40:34.037 --> 00:40:36.619
Uh... that was one of
the first sites.

727
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:39.619
And then the second day,
we did, um,

728
00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.619
uh, we took a boat on a river

729
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.077
down to the Lamanai pyramids.

730
00:40:43.078 --> 00:40:44.495
And then we came back and...

731
00:40:46.328 --> 00:40:47.494
Yeah.

732
00:40:48.786 --> 00:40:50.578
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

733
00:40:51.452 --> 00:40:53.244
Saw a bunch of monkeys.

734
00:40:54.411 --> 00:40:57.783
So you're positive you've
never printed anything out

735
00:40:57.784 --> 00:40:59.910
that was outside
of your work role?

736
00:41:04.368 --> 00:41:06.201
Uh, I'm trying to think.

737
00:41:06.202 --> 00:41:07.325
Um...

738
00:41:08.242 --> 00:41:09.449
uh...

739
00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:12.365
because there's, um, there's,

740
00:41:12.366 --> 00:41:13.824
there's NSA Pulse,

741
00:41:13.825 --> 00:41:17.241
and, uh, from time to time,
I, I do print out articles

742
00:41:17.907 --> 00:41:20.949
from that and use
as scratch paper.

743
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:23.781
Uh, th-that sounds really dumb.

744
00:41:23.782 --> 00:41:26.032
Uh, (laughs) now that
I'm thinking about it,

745
00:41:26.033 --> 00:41:28.948
the things that I, I did
were r-r-r-really dumb, uh.

746
00:41:28.949 --> 00:41:31.323
But then, I always threw it out
in the burn bin.

747
00:41:31.324 --> 00:41:32.571
Okay.

748
00:41:32.572 --> 00:41:34.491
<i>What kind of articles
from Pulse do you pull out?</i>

749
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:38.322
<i>Uh, usually reference
material about, like...</i>

750
00:41:39.781 --> 00:41:42.070
<i>uh, just making sure,
like, so many references</i>

751
00:41:42.071 --> 00:41:44.113
<i>that I keep having
to re-look up,</i>

752
00:41:44.114 --> 00:41:47.987
so that's probably a fraud,
waste, and abuse right there.

753
00:41:47.988 --> 00:41:50.489
We're not worried about
fraud, waste, and abuse.

754
00:41:51.364 --> 00:41:52.444
Okay.

755
00:41:52.445 --> 00:41:53.570
No.

756
00:41:55.947 --> 00:41:58.027
I use a lot of papers,

757
00:41:58.028 --> 00:42:01.985
but nothing outside
of Iranian stuff or anything

758
00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:04.611
other than that, and never
outside of the building.

759
00:42:04.612 --> 00:42:05.821
Okay.

760
00:42:06.403 --> 00:42:07.486
Reality,

761
00:42:08.236 --> 00:42:10.278
what if I said that I have
the information

762
00:42:10.279 --> 00:42:12.025
to suggest that
you did print out stuff

763
00:42:12.026 --> 00:42:13.902
that was outside of that scope?

764
00:42:17.485 --> 00:42:19.235
I mean, I would...

765
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:21.485
I would try to remember.

766
00:42:22.734 --> 00:42:23.775
Okay.

767
00:42:23.776 --> 00:42:24.900
What if I said

768
00:42:24.901 --> 00:42:27.525
that you printed out information

769
00:42:27.526 --> 00:42:29.609
related to, uh, reports on...

770
00:42:37.358 --> 00:42:38.400
Reality?

771
00:42:39.567 --> 00:42:40.816
Uh...

772
00:42:40.817 --> 00:42:42.898
we obviously know
a lot more than,

773
00:42:42.899 --> 00:42:44.816
than what we're
telling you at this point.

774
00:42:46.191 --> 00:42:47.939
And I think, I think
you know a lot more

775
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.732
than what you're telling us
at this point.

776
00:42:50.441 --> 00:42:52.814
I don't want you
to go down the wrong road.

777
00:42:52.815 --> 00:42:55.231
I think you need to, to stop

778
00:42:55.232 --> 00:42:57.854
and think about
what you're saying

779
00:42:57.855 --> 00:42:59.189
and what you're doing.

780
00:42:59.856 --> 00:43:02.479
I think it-it-it's an,
an opportunity

781
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.729
to maybe tell the truth.

782
00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.855
Because t-telling a,

783
00:43:05.856 --> 00:43:09.020
telling a lie to an FBI agent

784
00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:10.897
is not going to be
the right thing.

785
00:43:11.647 --> 00:43:12.563
Okay?

786
00:43:12.564 --> 00:43:15.105
Uh, you know, uh, again,

787
00:43:15.897 --> 00:43:18.103
we're here voluntarily.

788
00:43:18.104 --> 00:43:20.980
You're talking voluntarily.

789
00:43:21.313 --> 00:43:24.687
I'm not asking you,
forcing you to do anything

790
00:43:24.688 --> 00:43:25.980
but think.

791
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.311
That-that-that's what
I'm asking you to do is think.

792
00:43:30.728 --> 00:43:32.476
So...

793
00:43:32.477 --> 00:43:34.687
think about
what he just asked you

794
00:43:35.019 --> 00:43:36.311
and let, you know...

795
00:43:47.518 --> 00:43:48.975
There's one I, uh, printed out

796
00:43:48.976 --> 00:43:50.518
because I wanted to read it.

797
00:43:56.102 --> 00:43:58.016
Can you remember
what day that was?

798
00:43:59.308 --> 00:44:01.891
I might mess up
the dates, but, um...

799
00:44:02.975 --> 00:44:06.225
late, late March, early, uh...

800
00:44:07.307 --> 00:44:09.474
early April.
And what was it?

801
00:44:11.225 --> 00:44:13.182
It was an
NSA Pulse article about...

802
00:44:17.722 --> 00:44:20.141
Okay.
And, uh...

803
00:44:21.431 --> 00:44:22.764
I did print that one out.

804
00:44:25.557 --> 00:44:26.555
Okay.

805
00:44:27.805 --> 00:44:29.514
Why...

806
00:44:30.014 --> 00:44:31.430
Why did you print that one out?

807
00:44:33.055 --> 00:44:35.596
Um, because I wanted to read it.

808
00:44:35.597 --> 00:44:38.679
Uh, the way I, I downloaded
it, it was hard to read,

809
00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.304
so, um...

810
00:44:40.305 --> 00:44:42.219
uh, just,

811
00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.719
it looked like a, a piece
of history, you know?

812
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.178
And I, I wanted it on my desk
for, like, a day.

813
00:44:48.303 --> 00:44:50.179
Did you, uh...
H-how did you find it?

814
00:44:51.845 --> 00:44:53.844
Uh, so if you go on Pulse,

815
00:44:53.845 --> 00:44:56.011
there's a...

816
00:44:56.012 --> 00:44:58.510
uh, the top right,
they have a tab

817
00:44:58.511 --> 00:45:01.718
that says "articles,"
and I, I scroll through those.

818
00:45:01.719 --> 00:45:03.843
Uh...

819
00:45:03.844 --> 00:45:04.926
I don't know
if you guys saw the one

820
00:45:04.927 --> 00:45:07.008
about the
miniature ponies, but...

821
00:45:07.009 --> 00:45:08.384
We missed that one.
Yeah.

822
00:45:08.385 --> 00:45:09.592
No, that was,

823
00:45:09.593 --> 00:45:10.926
uh, that was number one
for, like, a year,

824
00:45:10.927 --> 00:45:12.800
so obviously I go
to check to see

825
00:45:12.801 --> 00:45:13.967
if there's any other gems.

826
00:45:13.968 --> 00:45:16.092
And then there was,
there was that one,

827
00:45:16.093 --> 00:45:19.174
and I saw it on the news
and I was just like,

828
00:45:19.175 --> 00:45:21.966
yeah, I, uh,
I wanted to read it.

829
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.217
So, yeah.

830
00:45:24.758 --> 00:45:26.425
- Okay.
- What did you do with the article?

831
00:45:27.007 --> 00:45:30.217
I kept it on my desk
for, like, three days.

832
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:36.965
I'm going to be honest.

833
00:45:40.216 --> 00:45:42.214
I only read, like, half of it.

834
00:45:43.048 --> 00:45:45.089
It was the stupidest thing ever.

835
00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.839
Uh, and then, and then
I burned bagged it

836
00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.506
in the box with the slat,
uh, next to the fridge.

837
00:45:50.132 --> 00:45:53.212
Okay. Uh, did you
print out any other articles?

838
00:45:53.213 --> 00:45:55.505
No, no, I just,
just, only the one.

839
00:45:55.506 --> 00:45:57.170
Okay.

840
00:45:57.171 --> 00:45:58.255
Talking around it.

841
00:45:59.004 --> 00:46:01.213
You're pretty sure it was
late April, early March.

842
00:46:01.214 --> 00:46:03.003
Think about, uh,
try to remember, like,

843
00:46:03.004 --> 00:46:04.212
details in your personal life.

844
00:46:04.213 --> 00:46:07.419
I know! I-I'm trying.
I d... I don't...

845
00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.712
<i>I don't, I don't remember.</i>

846
00:46:08.713 --> 00:46:10.545
<i>Um, I got in a fight</i>

847
00:46:10.546 --> 00:46:13.335
<i>with the boyfriend that week.</i>

848
00:46:13.336 --> 00:46:15.838
God, when did I break up with him?
I-I don't remember.

849
00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.502
God, I'm, I'm really
blanking on what week,

850
00:46:18.503 --> 00:46:20.293
what the, what the weekend
was like before that.

851
00:46:20.294 --> 00:46:21.835
I-I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

852
00:46:21.836 --> 00:46:24.294
Uh, I'm trying. God.

853
00:46:24.794 --> 00:46:27.667
Yeah. Mid-, mid-April
is all I'm thinking.

854
00:46:27.668 --> 00:46:28.710
Okay. Alright.

855
00:46:28.711 --> 00:46:30.334
What if I tell you that I know

856
00:46:30.335 --> 00:46:32.500
that you searched for
and printed out a document

857
00:46:32.501 --> 00:46:34.210
on the ninth of May?

858
00:46:35.585 --> 00:46:36.959
The ninth of May?

859
00:46:38.209 --> 00:46:39.710
<i>Uh, let me see.</i>

860
00:46:40.251 --> 00:46:44.001
The CrossFit competition
was on the 12th.

861
00:46:44.959 --> 00:46:47.957
God, was it really that late?
Um...

862
00:46:47.958 --> 00:46:49.416
I-I-I mean, I can't argue that.

863
00:46:49.417 --> 00:46:52.081
If-if you know, you know,
I mean, obviously you know.

864
00:46:52.082 --> 00:46:54.749
- I mean, I-I just, I can't imagine.
- Okay, uh...

865
00:46:55.375 --> 00:46:58.374
I mean, I guess
we're already June already.

866
00:47:00.624 --> 00:47:03.080
It's, it's been a really
bad month for me.

867
00:47:03.081 --> 00:47:04.622
Do you remember what you did

868
00:47:04.623 --> 00:47:06.040
to get to that article?

869
00:47:07.164 --> 00:47:09.497
Other than seeing it on the,

870
00:47:09.498 --> 00:47:10.706
on the front page
or linking it...

871
00:47:10.707 --> 00:47:12.579
Uh, do you remember
what search terms

872
00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:13.664
you might have put in?

873
00:47:22.997 --> 00:47:24.871
Probably...

874
00:47:27.495 --> 00:47:29.662
I'm not very sophisticated.

875
00:47:29.663 --> 00:47:31.329
Okay. So...

876
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:33.494
you did print out a document,

877
00:47:33.495 --> 00:47:35.495
uh, an intelligence report.

878
00:47:35.496 --> 00:47:36.995
Y-you do recall that?

879
00:47:37.828 --> 00:47:39.870
Yeah, I do remember now. Yeah.

880
00:47:40.245 --> 00:47:42.452
Okay. What did you do
with that report?

881
00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:47.659
I kept it on my desk
for three days,

882
00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.660
and, um, I thought it was
interesting and I would read it.

883
00:47:50.661 --> 00:47:53.659
And then I said, no, I sh... I
should not have this on my desk.

884
00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:55.368
And so I put it in the burn bag.

885
00:47:55.369 --> 00:47:56.868
Where's the burn bag?

886
00:47:57.325 --> 00:47:58.950
Okay, uh,

887
00:47:58.951 --> 00:48:01.326
it's in the, uh, break room.

888
00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:05.284
Uh, it's the white box
with the little slat on it,

889
00:48:05.285 --> 00:48:06.242
one over from the fridge.

890
00:48:06.243 --> 00:48:08.449
So you just
slide it in there and...

891
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:10.158
- And it's taken care of?
- Yeah.

892
00:48:12.157 --> 00:48:13.908
Okay, Reality...

893
00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.657
are you sure that's what
you did with it?

894
00:48:16.658 --> 00:48:17.949
Yes.

895
00:48:18.907 --> 00:48:20.241
You're positive?

896
00:48:21.158 --> 00:48:23.531
Yes. You didn't take
it out of the building?

897
00:48:23.532 --> 00:48:24.823
No.

898
00:48:24.824 --> 00:48:25.865
You didn't take it
out of the building

899
00:48:25.866 --> 00:48:26.989
and give it to anybody?

900
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:28.822
No.
You didn't send it?

901
00:48:28.823 --> 00:48:31.115
No. You didn't
send it to anyone?

902
00:48:31.116 --> 00:48:32.197
No.

903
00:48:33.072 --> 00:48:34.697
Reality, can you guess
how many people

904
00:48:34.698 --> 00:48:36.281
might have printed out
that article?

905
00:48:38.322 --> 00:48:39.530
No.

906
00:48:39.531 --> 00:48:41.115
It's not many.

907
00:48:41.613 --> 00:48:43.988
That article has made it
outside of NSA.

908
00:48:43.989 --> 00:48:46.530
Okay? Obviously,
because we're here.

909
00:48:48.113 --> 00:48:49.904
And the most likely candidate

910
00:48:49.905 --> 00:48:52.904
by far and away is you.

911
00:48:54.529 --> 00:48:56.278
So now,

912
00:48:56.279 --> 00:48:58.819
I-I-I don't think...

913
00:48:58.820 --> 00:48:59.987
I don't think you're a,
you know,

914
00:48:59.988 --> 00:49:02.819
a, a big bad master spy
or anything.

915
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.861
Okay? I don't.
I don't think that.

916
00:49:04.862 --> 00:49:06.402
I think that I've looked
at the evidence,

917
00:49:06.403 --> 00:49:08.777
and it's compelling.

918
00:49:09.987 --> 00:49:11.693
Now, I'm not sure
why you did it,

919
00:49:11.694 --> 00:49:13.734
and I'm curious as to that,

920
00:49:13.735 --> 00:49:14.985
but I think

921
00:49:14.986 --> 00:49:16.818
you might have been angry
over everything

922
00:49:16.819 --> 00:49:18.860
that's going on politics-wise.

923
00:49:19.777 --> 00:49:21.235
Because you can't turn on the...

924
00:49:22.192 --> 00:49:24.484
you can't turn on the TV
without getting pissed off.

925
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.401
Or at least I can't.

926
00:49:27.859 --> 00:49:30.192
I think you might have
just made a mistake.

927
00:49:30.985 --> 00:49:32.940
Now, why I'm here
and why I want to talk to you

928
00:49:32.941 --> 00:49:35.442
is to figure out
the why behind this.

929
00:49:35.443 --> 00:49:37.314
Okay?

930
00:49:37.315 --> 00:49:39.733
So... I ask you again.

931
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:42.774
Did you take it out and send it?

932
00:49:45.275 --> 00:49:47.356
I... I didn't.

933
00:49:48.648 --> 00:49:50.481
I-I-I put it in the burn bag.

934
00:49:50.482 --> 00:49:52.480
I mean, I'm trying to deploy.

935
00:49:52.481 --> 00:49:54.522
I'm not trying to be a whistleblower.
That's crazy.

936
00:49:54.523 --> 00:49:56.814
So how would you think that a
document would end up getting out?

937
00:49:56.815 --> 00:49:59.063
Uh, I mean...

938
00:49:59.064 --> 00:50:00.481
I, I mean...

939
00:50:03.439 --> 00:50:04.938
Let's be honest, there's,

940
00:50:04.939 --> 00:50:07.895
there's little to no security
on the documents.

941
00:50:07.896 --> 00:50:09.855
I mean, nobody pats you down.
Mm-hmm.

942
00:50:09.856 --> 00:50:11.478
We talk about it all the time
at work, like,

943
00:50:11.479 --> 00:50:12.603
"Oh, you have to show our lunch.

944
00:50:12.604 --> 00:50:13.687
Oh, you eat so healthy,"

945
00:50:13.688 --> 00:50:15.438
like every day, all the time.

946
00:50:15.439 --> 00:50:16.812
And people just, they...

947
00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:20.186
I mean, we, we have a building
full of geniuses, right?

948
00:50:20.187 --> 00:50:22.977
And, I mean, I guess I'm just...

949
00:50:22.978 --> 00:50:25.019
I'm, I'm, I'm talking
and I'm nervous,

950
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.686
but I-I didn't,
I didn't do anything with it.

951
00:50:28.311 --> 00:50:30.144
I mean, I-I'm trying
to go somewhere else.

952
00:50:30.145 --> 00:50:32.309
I'm trying to increase my clearance.
Okay.

953
00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:34.518
I mean, I... and I know
it was sensitive

954
00:50:34.519 --> 00:50:35.768
and I thought it
would be cool to have

955
00:50:35.769 --> 00:50:37.017
on my desk for a couple days.

956
00:50:37.018 --> 00:50:38.226
Okay. But do you remember,
you said you remember

957
00:50:38.227 --> 00:50:40.143
putting it in the,
in the, the burn bag.

958
00:50:40.144 --> 00:50:41.309
Yeah.
Just sliding it in there.

959
00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:42.434
Okay.

960
00:50:42.435 --> 00:50:44.018
I remember that.
Folded in half.

961
00:50:45.477 --> 00:50:47.017
Folded in half?

962
00:50:50.351 --> 00:50:52.350
Yeah. Yeah, um...

963
00:50:53.308 --> 00:50:54.517
Because it didn't...

964
00:50:56.392 --> 00:50:57.808
Yeah, uh, folded in half.

965
00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.224
What if I tell you
that that document

966
00:51:03.141 --> 00:51:04.266
folded in half

967
00:51:05.017 --> 00:51:07.306
made its way outside of NSA?

968
00:51:09.141 --> 00:51:10.974
I, I don't, I don't...
Made its way out

969
00:51:10.975 --> 00:51:13.515
in an envelope
postmarked Augusta, Georgia.

970
00:51:14.306 --> 00:51:17.347
See, things are starting
to get a little specific.

971
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:22.263
Yeah. Made its way to
an online news source

972
00:51:22.264 --> 00:51:23.930
that you subscribe to.

973
00:51:23.931 --> 00:51:25.723
Getting really specific.

974
00:51:28.139 --> 00:51:29.848
So I'm going to ask you again.

975
00:51:34.888 --> 00:51:37.846
What is very, very...

976
00:51:39.179 --> 00:51:40.847
very compelling...

977
00:51:44.345 --> 00:51:45.636
I'd like to know the reason

978
00:51:45.637 --> 00:51:48.011
because I, I-I don't think

979
00:51:48.012 --> 00:51:51.053
you make a habit
out of this at all.

980
00:51:51.054 --> 00:51:52.926
At all.

981
00:51:52.927 --> 00:51:56.261
I think you just...
messed up.

982
00:51:57.302 --> 00:51:58.801
Now, I'm not sure
why you did it,

983
00:51:58.802 --> 00:52:01.012
and I'd like to hear
from you on that.

984
00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:05.135
But the what and the how

985
00:52:05.136 --> 00:52:08.051
would you agree...
looks awfully bad?

986
00:52:09.635 --> 00:52:11.052
It looks really bad. Yeah.

987
00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.968
If you're angry
about what's going on,

988
00:52:15.968 --> 00:52:17.341
if there's anything that...

989
00:52:20.509 --> 00:52:22.132
Look, you've had a good career.

990
00:52:22.133 --> 00:52:23.258
You have.

991
00:52:23.883 --> 00:52:26.173
If there's something
that just pushed you

992
00:52:26.174 --> 00:52:27.340
over the edge on this...

993
00:52:29.008 --> 00:52:30.717
now is the perfect time.

994
00:52:32.173 --> 00:52:33.340
This is a podium.

995
00:52:37.631 --> 00:52:39.506
You know,

996
00:52:39.507 --> 00:52:42.506
like... like he said,

997
00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.589
I, I don't think
we're coming in here to say

998
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:49.380
you're some big, bad mastermind,
prolific spy kind of thing.

999
00:52:49.381 --> 00:52:53.129
I think what we both think is
that maybe you made a mistake.

1000
00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:55.005
Maybe you weren't thinking
for a minute.

1001
00:52:55.006 --> 00:52:56.879
Maybe you got angry,
like he said.

1002
00:52:58.255 --> 00:53:00.839
I mean,
th-that's what I'm hoping.

1003
00:53:01.629 --> 00:53:02.794
If th-that's the case,

1004
00:53:02.795 --> 00:53:04.253
then that makes us feel
a little better

1005
00:53:04.254 --> 00:53:08.961
knowing we don't have a,
a real serious problem here.

1006
00:53:08.962 --> 00:53:11.919
You know, that's something
that concerns us, too.

1007
00:53:12.628 --> 00:53:15.587
That, that this isn't
an, an ongoing problem.

1008
00:53:16.211 --> 00:53:17.918
But we need to figure it out.

1009
00:53:17.919 --> 00:53:20.211
And if it was a mistake...

1010
00:53:21.835 --> 00:53:23.127
let's deal with it.

1011
00:53:24.878 --> 00:53:26.459
Is this...

1012
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.043
is this a room?

1013
00:53:29.793 --> 00:53:31.168
Agent 2:
Is that a room?

1014
00:53:43.834 --> 00:53:45.750
So how'd you get it
out of the office?

1015
00:54:04.123 --> 00:54:06.248
Folded in half in my pantyhose.

1016
00:54:21.204 --> 00:54:22.288
Okay.

1017
00:54:23.496 --> 00:54:24.705
And what did you do with it?

1018
00:54:34.454 --> 00:54:37.118
I put it in an envelope
and sent it to...

1019
00:54:37.119 --> 00:54:39.120
Anybody specifically there?

1020
00:54:39.744 --> 00:54:41.578
I don't think I put a name.
I just put...

1021
00:54:42.119 --> 00:54:44.118
Had you communicated with them
prior to you doing that? With...

1022
00:54:44.119 --> 00:54:46.785
No, I wasn't trying to be
a Snowden or anything.

1023
00:54:46.786 --> 00:54:48.409
And that's what...
I don't think you were either.

1024
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:49.701
I really don't.

1025
00:54:49.702 --> 00:54:52.492
But I, I, I think
you made a mistake.

1026
00:54:52.493 --> 00:54:54.659
But...

1027
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.117
I don't think either one of us

1028
00:54:56.118 --> 00:54:58.284
think you were trying
to be Snowden.

1029
00:54:59.118 --> 00:55:02.032
No, it was, it was just
the one document.

1030
00:55:02.033 --> 00:55:03.783
And like you said, because...
Right.

1031
00:55:03.784 --> 00:55:07.323
I've had, um, a,
a really hard time at work.

1032
00:55:07.324 --> 00:55:10.199
Uh, I've, I've, I've filed
formal complaints

1033
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.615
about them having
Fox News on all the time

1034
00:55:13.616 --> 00:55:16.741
<i>and, and, like, for God's
sake, put Al-Jazeera on</i>

1035
00:55:16.742 --> 00:55:18.698
or a slideshow of people's pets.

1036
00:55:18.699 --> 00:55:19.990
Like, I've tried everything
to get that changed.

1037
00:55:19.991 --> 00:55:21.406
It would probably
be a good thing.

1038
00:55:21.407 --> 00:55:22.448
Unfortunately, it doesn't matter

1039
00:55:22.449 --> 00:55:23.448
which side you're watching,

1040
00:55:23.449 --> 00:55:24.823
they're all pretty bad.

1041
00:55:24.824 --> 00:55:26.574
Yeah.
But...

1042
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:30.115
<i>uh, I think the pets may be
the way to go.</i>

1043
00:55:32.572 --> 00:55:34.322
<i>The pets would have been great.</i>

1044
00:55:35.157 --> 00:55:36.197
<i>Uhm...</i>

1045
00:55:37.113 --> 00:55:39.448
<i>but just having that
every day and then...</i>

1046
00:55:45.322 --> 00:55:46.987
Where'd you mail it from?

1047
00:55:54.738 --> 00:55:56.611
Uh, mailbox

1048
00:55:56.612 --> 00:55:59.528
on, uh, Baston Road.

1049
00:55:59.529 --> 00:56:00.862
Okay.

1050
00:56:00.863 --> 00:56:03.068
It's, uh, it's,
uh, the shopping center

1051
00:56:03.069 --> 00:56:06.942
with the bank and the Earth
Fare gro-gro-grocery store.

1052
00:56:06.943 --> 00:56:08.484
Okay, I know
where you're talking about.

1053
00:56:08.485 --> 00:56:10.360
At the intersection
of Baston Road

1054
00:56:10.361 --> 00:56:11.817
and F-Fury's Ferry.

1055
00:56:11.818 --> 00:56:13.109
Fury's Ferry. Okay.
Mm-hmm.

1056
00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:16.276
I never could say that right.
Fur-Fury's Ferry.

1057
00:56:16.277 --> 00:56:17.817
And it was just
a mailbox sittin' out

1058
00:56:17.818 --> 00:56:19.526
in the middle
of the parking lot?

1059
00:56:19.527 --> 00:56:21.276
<i>Mm-hmm.
Just a metal box, yeah.</i>

1060
00:56:23.609 --> 00:56:25.359
Okay.
Okay.

1061
00:56:33.567 --> 00:56:34.984
Do you remember what day it was?

1062
00:56:36.815 --> 00:56:39.733
What day of the week
was the ninth?

1063
00:56:40.317 --> 00:56:42.148
Let's see. Um...

1064
00:56:42.149 --> 00:56:43.316
Uh, we'll check.

1065
00:56:44.649 --> 00:56:45.982
Need some water or something?

1066
00:56:45.983 --> 00:56:47.564
I'd like some water
once we figure out

1067
00:56:47.565 --> 00:56:48.605
what day of the week it was.

1068
00:56:48.606 --> 00:56:49.565
Okay.
Let's see.

1069
00:56:49.566 --> 00:56:51.522
I want to say it was, uh,

1070
00:56:51.523 --> 00:56:53.605
if I can figure out
this crazy phone,

1071
00:56:53.606 --> 00:56:54.981
I want to say it was a Tuesday.

1072
00:56:54.982 --> 00:56:56.481
Tuesday?
Yeah.

1073
00:56:57.272 --> 00:56:59.397
Is there something
significant about the ninth

1074
00:56:59.398 --> 00:57:01.646
- in other ways?
- No. Uh, it was,

1075
00:57:01.647 --> 00:57:03.812
it was just
the first day I saw it, uh.

1076
00:57:03.813 --> 00:57:05.521
If it... if, if...

1077
00:57:05.522 --> 00:57:07.437
It might have been
the 11th or the 12th

1078
00:57:07.438 --> 00:57:10.438
if, if I subbed yoga on the,

1079
00:57:10.439 --> 00:57:11.769
on the night of the 11th,

1080
00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:13.478
then, uh, the yoga studio
is right there.

1081
00:57:13.479 --> 00:57:15.687
So it would have been
a Thursday or Friday?

1082
00:57:15.688 --> 00:57:17.478
Thursday or Friday.
Okay.

1083
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.437
What yoga studio?

1084
00:57:20.438 --> 00:57:23.436
Uh, it's called Oh Yeah Yoga.

1085
00:57:23.437 --> 00:57:24.936
So, you said maybe

1086
00:57:24.937 --> 00:57:27.435
you mailed it
Thursday or Friday?

1087
00:57:27.436 --> 00:57:29.602
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

1088
00:57:29.603 --> 00:57:33.603
How did you know to,
uh, mail it to...

1089
00:58:06.931 --> 00:58:09.182
So you wanted
to be able to publish it?

1090
00:58:10.474 --> 00:58:11.472
Yeah.

1091
00:58:12.056 --> 00:58:13.598
Did you send it anywhere else?

1092
00:58:13.599 --> 00:58:15.141
No.
No?

1093
00:58:15.849 --> 00:58:17.138
No other publications

1094
00:58:17.139 --> 00:58:19.097
you've shown it to
or given it to?

1095
00:58:19.098 --> 00:58:20.930
No.

1096
00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:22.096
Is there gonna be anything here

1097
00:58:22.097 --> 00:58:23.597
that we're gonna be
surprised to find?

1098
00:58:23.598 --> 00:58:25.346
No, I, I never took the
document out of my car.

1099
00:58:25.347 --> 00:58:27.805
Is there anything
on your phone or your computer?

1100
00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:30.929
On my, on my phone, you might,

1101
00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:32.386
I don't, I don't know
if I deleted it,

1102
00:58:32.387 --> 00:58:34.095
but you guys are probably going
to be able to see it anyway,

1103
00:58:34.096 --> 00:58:37.804
but there will be
a screenshot of the address.

1104
00:58:41.721 --> 00:58:43.928
Okay.
Okay.

1105
00:58:45.013 --> 00:58:46.927
Uh, you mentioned
you wanted some water?

1106
00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:49.927
Yeah.

1107
00:58:49.928 --> 00:58:51.969
- Yeah. Why don't we, uh...
- No, I'll make it.

1108
00:58:52.594 --> 00:58:55.178
Uh, I'm just gonna
get somebody out here.

1109
00:58:58.177 --> 00:59:00.510
Hey, can I, can I have
somebody in here, please?

1110
00:59:00.511 --> 00:59:02.676
Uh, do you want
a bottle of water?

1111
00:59:03.718 --> 00:59:04.969
Um...

1112
00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:07.800
Do you have
a filter in the fridge

1113
00:59:07.801 --> 00:59:09.301
or do you just want
tap water or...

1114
00:59:09.302 --> 00:59:10.426
Ta-tap water.

1115
00:59:10.427 --> 00:59:13.258
There's, um, a,
a mason jar glass

1116
00:59:13.259 --> 00:59:14.467
next to the sink.

1117
00:59:15.509 --> 00:59:17.424
Can I get one person
to stand here, please,

1118
00:59:17.425 --> 00:59:19.134
so I can go to the kitchen?

1119
00:59:46.505 --> 00:59:48.129
You guys, uh,

1120
00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:49.839
you're not going
to fit in there anymore.

1121
00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.439
She's not going to fit
in there anymore.

1122
01:00:00.088 --> 01:00:01.503
She's still under the bed?

1123
01:00:01.504 --> 01:00:03.503
Huh?
The cat.

1124
01:00:03.504 --> 01:00:05.671
Is the cat still under the bed?

1125
01:00:07.336 --> 01:00:08.754
She's a big girl.

1126
01:00:16.752 --> 01:00:18.418
Oh yeah, we-we're trying.

1127
01:00:18.419 --> 01:00:20.086
How old is she?

1128
01:00:23.752 --> 01:00:25.711
She's three years now.

1129
01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.750
But girl likes to eat.

1130
01:00:32.751 --> 01:00:34.084
Oh yeah.

1131
01:00:34.585 --> 01:00:35.917
She likes carbs.

1132
01:00:35.918 --> 01:00:37.957
She's got
a little slim fit on her.

1133
01:00:37.958 --> 01:00:39.126
Mm-hmm.

1134
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.291
She came out, I was like...

1135
01:00:41.292 --> 01:00:42.624
Whoa!

1136
01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:45.583
Yeah.

1137
01:00:45.584 --> 01:00:47.623
She'll snatch bread
right out of my mouth.

1138
01:00:47.624 --> 01:00:48.749
Like...
Wow.

1139
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:50.750
Girl,
you do not need those.

1140
01:01:15.122 --> 01:01:16.164
Water.

1141
01:01:22.537 --> 01:01:23.787
Thanks.

1142
01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.952
So other than the screenshot
on the phone,

1143
01:01:31.953 --> 01:01:33.119
there shouldn't be
anything else?

1144
01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.453
And there should be nothing
on the laptop?

1145
01:01:35.454 --> 01:01:36.827
Nothing on the laptop.

1146
01:01:40.495 --> 01:01:42.118
I do have a Tor browser.

1147
01:01:47.035 --> 01:01:51.076
Which probably looks bad, but...

1148
01:01:52.492 --> 01:01:54.909
Okay.

1149
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:57.783
What do you... use, what do
you use the Tor browser for?

1150
01:02:26.157 --> 01:02:28.156
Have you had any contact
with anyone from...

1151
01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:39.864
The Intercept?

1152
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:42.862
Have you tried to reach out?

1153
01:02:42.863 --> 01:02:45.987
Like you said,
I saw the article,

1154
01:02:45.988 --> 01:02:48.154
and I couldn't believe
it wasn't a thing.

1155
01:02:49.113 --> 01:02:50.280
It made you mad.

1156
01:02:51.862 --> 01:02:53.820
It made me very mad.

I just thought that...
that week

1211
01:05:26.263 --> 01:05:29.263
there was just too much to sit
back and watch it and think,

1212
01:05:30.055 --> 01:05:33.387
why do I have this job
if I'm going to be helpless?

I'm sorry.

1215
01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.220

1216
01:05:45.054 --> 01:05:47.136
Was there something that just

1217
01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:50.095
just... did it.

1218
01:05:51.636 --> 01:05:53.552
Because you don't seem
the type to do this.

1219
01:05:54.219 --> 01:05:56.509
I-I-I'm not. I-I-I believe in it.
I wanna believe in it.

1220
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:57.885
I'm not. I...

1221
01:05:59.552 --> 01:06:02.384
I want to go out
With our Special Forces.

1222
01:06:03.052 --> 01:06:05.259
I mean, that's why I got
out of the Air Force.

1223
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.217
I-I-I...

1224
01:06:06.218 --> 01:06:08.216
It's wh...
It's why I'm here in Augusta.

1225
01:06:08.217 --> 01:06:09.884
I-I was trying to get
my clearance back

1226
01:06:09.885 --> 01:06:11.550
so I could get deployments.

1227
01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:14.634
I... It just was at a time I wasn't
applying for deployments. I...

1228
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.758
I had seven, eight months
left of a job

1229
01:06:18.759 --> 01:06:20.216
that didn't mean anything to me

1230
01:06:20.217 --> 01:06:22.631
because it's, it's Iran,
and I'm a Pashto linguist.

1231
01:06:22.632 --> 01:06:25.007
Like, what am I doing
translating Farsi?

1232
01:06:25.008 --> 01:06:26.299
I-I just...

1233
01:06:28.257 --> 01:06:29.590
I felt hopeless.

1234
01:06:29.591 --> 01:06:31.631
And seeing that information

1235
01:06:31.632 --> 01:06:33.756
be contested back and forth,

1236
01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:35.715
back and forth
in the public domain

1237
01:06:35.716 --> 01:06:37.713
with everything else
that just keeps getting released

1238
01:06:37.714 --> 01:06:39.714
and everything that keeps
getting leaked, like,

1239
01:06:39.715 --> 01:06:42.379
why can't this get out there?

1240
01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.089
Why can't this be public?

1241
01:06:50.464 --> 01:06:52.755
Were you surprised
to see us today?

1242
01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:58.588
Yeah. Actually, I thought

1243
01:06:59.171 --> 01:07:00.629
you were here to ask
about the house

1244
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:02.878
because it's still
for lease online.

1245
01:07:02.879 --> 01:07:05.463
Because you didn't seem
surprised when we pulled up.

1246
01:07:05.962 --> 01:07:09.378
Oh, God. That's just because
I have a resting bitch face.

1247
01:07:10.129 --> 01:07:14.127
You guys turn around
and, and "FBI."

1248
01:07:14.128 --> 01:07:16.710
I was like, what is going on,
you know?

1249
01:07:17.294 --> 01:07:20.793
And then you showed
your badge right up and, uh...

1250
01:07:23.918 --> 01:07:26.833
I submitted my
security packet yesterday

1251
01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:28.208
for my clearance on E-QIP.

1252
01:07:28.209 --> 01:07:29.293
So I thought

1253
01:07:30.376 --> 01:07:31.874
that was what it's for.

1254
01:07:31.875 --> 01:07:33.708
I was like,
why are you guys questioning me

1255
01:07:33.709 --> 01:07:34.791
for my own clearance?

1256
01:07:34.792 --> 01:07:36.417
But...
Okay.

1257
01:07:38.375 --> 01:07:40.084
That's, that's not going
to happen.

1258
01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:42.624
Uh...

1259
01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:44.125
Anything else you can think of?

1260
01:07:45.083 --> 01:07:47.206
What we have to do is
we have to do the search.

1261
01:07:47.207 --> 01:07:48.457
Of course.

1262
01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:51.082
Uh, you said...

1263
01:07:52.874 --> 01:07:54.831
Sorry, I have a sinus infection,

1264
01:07:54.832 --> 01:07:56.123
- so I sound...
- It's okay?

1265
01:07:57.123 --> 01:07:59.039
I sound awful.

1266
01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.798
Well, this is the best room
to be in it with.

1267
01:08:02.039 --> 01:08:03.998
Do you remember
the site from memory?

1268
01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:08.788
Uh, if you scroll down
to the bottom, there's contact,

1269
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:10.705
but it-it's not as obvious
as you think

1270
01:08:10.706 --> 01:08:12.203
because it's closer.

1271
01:08:12.204 --> 01:08:13.079
Mm-hmm.

1272
01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.747
How long did it
take you to find it?

1273
01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:20.163
<i>About probably three minutes
of scrolling,</i>

1274
01:08:20.164 --> 01:08:23.329
which felt like an eternity
sitting in my car.

1275
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:26.203
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

1276
01:08:26.204 --> 01:08:27.828
Yeah.
Uh...

1277
01:08:28.579 --> 01:08:30.745
you said the documents
stayed in your car.

1278
01:08:32.828 --> 01:08:35.745
Yeah. Where did you
get the envelope?

1279
01:08:37.744 --> 01:08:40.244
The box of envelopes is...

1280
01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:44.534
it's on the back seat in the car

1281
01:08:44.535 --> 01:08:46.410
behind the driver's seat.
I...

1282
01:08:47.243 --> 01:08:50.576
I had a bunch of forms
I had to mail out last December,

1283
01:08:50.577 --> 01:08:52.408
so it's been in my car
since December.

1284
01:08:52.409 --> 01:08:54.409
Okay.

1285
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:55.743
And the stamps?

1286
01:08:56.409 --> 01:08:57.742
Stamps.

1287
01:08:58.867 --> 01:09:01.615
I think I have about one
or two left in there,

1288
01:09:01.616 --> 01:09:03.824
uh, but I-I keep stamps
in the glove box

1289
01:09:03.825 --> 01:09:06.115
in case I have
to mail anything out,

1290
01:09:06.116 --> 01:09:07.698
like bills and stuff.

1291
01:09:07.699 --> 01:09:10.199
Okay. In, in your glove box?

1292
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.325
In the glove box, yeah.

1293
01:09:12.073 --> 01:09:14.823
Alright. Uh, I'm trying to
think if I have anything else.

1294
01:09:14.824 --> 01:09:18.032
Uh, the search, the, the guys
will continue the search.

1295
01:09:18.574 --> 01:09:20.573
Search the vehicle
and the house,

1296
01:09:20.574 --> 01:09:22.907
and they'll photograph everything.

1297
01:09:23.364 --> 01:09:25.822
Um, you, uh,
the search team leader,

1298
01:09:25.823 --> 01:09:28.198
uh, is gonna sit down with you
and go through things...

1299
01:09:34.697 --> 01:09:36.530
My passport...

1300
01:09:39.947 --> 01:09:42.321
<i>Do you have, uh,
any questions for me?</i>

1301
01:09:43.571 --> 01:09:45.071
<i>So many, um.</i>

1302
01:09:47.445 --> 01:09:49.821
This sounds really bad.

1303
01:09:51.778 --> 01:09:53.612
Am I going to jail tonight?

1304
01:09:56.278 --> 01:09:58.611
I don't know
how to answer that yet.

1305
01:09:58.612 --> 01:10:00.110
Okay.
What was the question?

1306
01:10:00.111 --> 01:10:02.693
- Uh, if she's going to jail tonight.
- Oh.

1307
01:10:02.694 --> 01:10:04.736
Said I don't have the answer
to that quite yet.

1308
01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:09.235
Of course, the, the search
is still going on, uh.

1309
01:10:09.903 --> 01:10:11.235
In the case that...

1310
01:10:12.485 --> 01:10:14.525
I don't have memorized...

1311
01:10:14.526 --> 01:10:16.816
The woman, her name is Cathy.

1312
01:10:16.817 --> 01:10:19.317
She works at
the Augusta Humane Society.

1313
01:10:19.318 --> 01:10:22.191
Okay. She can come and pick
up the dog in the case that

1314
01:10:22.192 --> 01:10:23.191
I-I-I-I'm not here tonight.

1315
01:10:23.192 --> 01:10:26.232
Well, let's don't...
Okay.

1316
01:10:26.233 --> 01:10:27.523
It's just...

1317
01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:28.608
Let's don't put the cart

1318
01:10:28.609 --> 01:10:30.068
before the horse right now.

1319
01:10:30.567 --> 01:10:32.190
Okay.

1320
01:10:32.191 --> 01:10:34.149
Okay?

1321
01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:35.691
That's just, um...
I understand.

1322
01:10:35.692 --> 01:10:37.148
My only concern
is getting her

1323
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:39.690
and then maybe one more phone
call to get the cat covered.

1324
01:10:39.691 --> 01:10:41.190
We'll, we'll figure that out.

1325
01:10:41.191 --> 01:10:43.273
If, if it comes to that,

1326
01:10:43.774 --> 01:10:45.523
we'll, we'll figure that out.

1327
01:10:45.524 --> 01:10:47.855
And I don't have the answer to that yet.
And I'm going to...

1328
01:10:47.856 --> 01:10:50.189
We'll, we'll cross that bridge
when we get to it. Okay?

1329
01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:51.563
Okay.

1330
01:10:51.564 --> 01:10:54.023
Uh, what else?

1331
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:46.807
You turn it off?

1332
01:11:46.808 --> 01:11:48.184
It's still recording.

1333
01:12:07.348 --> 01:12:08.681
<i>Copy.</i>

1334
01:12:18.597 --> 01:12:20.181
Would you like
to sit down somewhere?

1335
01:12:20.722 --> 01:12:22.680
- I'm fine.
- You're fine?

1336
01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:24.222
Yeah.

1337
01:12:46.511 --> 01:12:47.761
Reality.

1338
01:13:47.338 --> 01:13:49.962
Automated voice: <i>Hello. This
is a prepaid collect call</i>

1339
01:13:49.963 --> 01:13:51.836
<i>from an inmate
at Lincoln County Jail</i>

1340
01:13:51.837 --> 01:13:53.337
<i>in Lincolnton, Georgia.</i>

1341
01:13:53.338 --> 01:13:56.045
<i>This call is subject
to recording and monitoring.</i>

1342
01:13:56.046 --> 01:13:58.253
<i>To accept charges, press one.</i>

1343
01:13:58.254 --> 01:14:00.003
<i>As soon as Mom
and Gary get to Georgia,</i>

1344
01:14:00.004 --> 01:14:01.336
<i>they're going
to pick up Mina at least,</i>

1345
01:14:01.337 --> 01:14:04.252
<i>and Mickey will stay back
with the shelter,</i>

1346
01:14:04.253 --> 01:14:06.378
<i>but they're safe in the house.</i>

1347
01:14:07.252 --> 01:14:10.128
<i>Everyone was really worried about
them when they searched my house.</i>

1348
01:14:11.253 --> 01:14:12.877
<i>Bunch of dog people.</i>

1349
01:14:13.753 --> 01:14:15.503
<i>Yeah. I mean, that was
the one thing, like,</i>

1350
01:14:15.504 --> 01:14:17.167
<i>when the FBI
was interrogating me,</i>

1351
01:14:17.168 --> 01:14:18.542
<i>they were just like,</i>

1352
01:14:18.543 --> 01:14:20.377
<i>look, we have everything.
We're just...</i>

1353
01:14:20.877 --> 01:14:22.335
<i>we just want to know why.</i>

1354
01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:24.627
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

1355
01:14:25.834 --> 01:14:27.291
<i>They didn't care
about anything else.</i>

1356
01:14:27.292 --> 01:14:29.626
<i>They were just straight-up
curious to know why.</i>

1357
01:14:29.627 --> 01:14:31.791
They say Reality Winner
has two faces.

1358
01:14:31.792 --> 01:14:33.583
One an Air Force veteran,

1359
01:14:33.584 --> 01:14:35.334
a loving daughter,
and a yoga instructor.

1360
01:14:35.335 --> 01:14:38.041
The other, a person who
had taken a keen interest

1361
01:14:38.042 --> 01:14:40.374
in the Middle East
with suspicious motives.

1362
01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:42.248
When asked by the FBI,

1363
01:14:42.249 --> 01:14:45.500
Winner stated that she knew
the intelligence report

1364
01:14:45.501 --> 01:14:49.208
revealed sources and methods

1365
01:14:49.625 --> 01:14:52.372
used by the U.S.
intelligence agencies,

1366
01:14:52.373 --> 01:14:55.955
and she knew that compromising
those sources and methods

1367
01:14:55.956 --> 01:14:58.663
could be valuable
to our adversaries

1368
01:14:58.664 --> 01:15:00.831
and damage the United States.

1369
01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:04.247
<i>She claimed to hate America.</i>

1370
01:15:04.956 --> 01:15:09.497
<i>When asked, "You don't really
hate America, right?"</i>

1371
01:15:09.498 --> 01:15:12.454
She responded,
"I mean, yeah, I do.

1372
01:15:12.455 --> 01:15:16.788
It's literally the worst thing
to happen on the planet."

1373
01:15:17.829 --> 01:15:20.496
She was the
quintessential example

1374
01:15:20.497 --> 01:15:22.245
<i>of an insider threat.</i>

1375
01:15:22.579 --> 01:15:25.079
<i>Obviously an intemperate
political activist,</i>

1376
01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.327
<i>how did she get
a security clearance?</i>

1377
01:15:27.328 --> 01:15:28.911
<i>We could ask the same question</i>

1378
01:15:28.912 --> 01:15:32.285
<i>about a lot of people working
in government right now...</i>

1379
01:15:32.286 --> 01:15:34.535
<i>I keep telling myself
to act more like I think</i>

1380
01:15:34.536 --> 01:15:36.119
<i>I did something wrong.</i>

1381
01:15:36.951 --> 01:15:38.785
<i>We are more concerned
with the leaks</i>

1382
01:15:38.786 --> 01:15:41.409
<i>than we are with the fact
that the Russians</i>

1383
01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:43.034
<i>attacked our democracy</i>

1384
01:15:43.035 --> 01:15:44.659
<i>and that
the President's campaign</i>

1385
01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:45.825
<i>may have participated in it.</i>

1386
01:15:45.826 --> 01:15:47.533
<i>They didn't attack
our democracy.</i>

1387
01:15:47.534 --> 01:15:48.950
<i>- They did.
- That's a meaningful...</i>

1388
01:15:48.951 --> 01:15:50.451
<i>If you look at this,
this is sort of like</i>

1389
01:15:50.452 --> 01:15:53.742
<i>The Intercept knowingly
or unknowingly</i>

1390
01:15:53.743 --> 01:15:55.908
<i>outed their own source.</i>

1391
01:15:55.909 --> 01:15:57.407
<i>I mean, it made no sense.</i>

1392
01:15:57.408 --> 01:15:59.325
<i>It's like, is it that,
are you that...</i>

1393
01:15:59.326 --> 01:16:01.823
<i>Sloppy? Irresponsible?
What is it?</i>

1394
01:16:01.824 --> 01:16:02.699
<i>Both.</i>

1395
01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:03.949
As a journalist,
we count on people

1396
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:06.366
to leak us information
that's vital

1397
01:16:06.367 --> 01:16:07.990
for our democracy to function.

1398
01:16:07.991 --> 01:16:09.823
Knowing what happened
with the Russian hack

1399
01:16:09.824 --> 01:16:11.864
<i>was a very important thing.</i>

1400
01:16:11.865 --> 01:16:15.282
<i>Now, she did violate
the rules of her employment.</i>

1401
01:16:15.283 --> 01:16:18.198
<i>But this penalty
that she's gotten, five years,</i>

1402
01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:21.322
<i>is exceedingly long,
one of the longest penalties.</i>

1403
01:16:21.323 --> 01:16:23.572
<i>And it's obviously there
to create</i>

1404
01:16:23.573 --> 01:16:25.988
a, you know, a chilling effect.

1405
01:16:25.989 --> 01:16:28.321
Right? So that
other people don't do this

1406
01:16:28.322 --> 01:16:29.946
and k... we stay in the dark.

1407
01:16:29.947 --> 01:16:32.321
Automated voice: <i>You have one
minute remaining on your call.</i>

1408
01:16:32.322 --> 01:16:33.488
<i>You have one minute left.</i>

1409
01:16:33.489 --> 01:16:34.654
<i>If you could just get</i>

1410
01:16:34.655 --> 01:16:35.695
<i>that message to Lane.</i>

1411
01:16:35.696 --> 01:16:37.029
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

1412
01:16:37.529 --> 01:16:39.613
<i>Alright.
I really appreciate it.</i>

1413
01:16:39.614 --> 01:16:40.695
<i>Yeah, of course.
I'm just worried that...</i>

1414
01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:41.861
<i>Oh, and one more name.</i>

1415
01:16:41.862 --> 01:16:44.362
<i>Don Z.
Last name starts with a Z.</i>

1416
01:16:44.363 --> 01:16:46.944
<i>Okay. Tell him I'm
probably not gonna</i>

1417
01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.613
<i>talk to him again, but, um,</i>

1418
01:16:50.154 --> 01:16:52.902
<i>I'm doin' pushups like crazy
and I'm going to miss him.</i>

1419
01:16:52.903 --> 01:16:54.486
<i>Just let him know that...</i>

1420
01:16:54.487 --> 01:16:56.653
<i>Obviously been recording.</i>

1421
01:16:57.486 --> 01:16:58.861
<i>I'm going to...</i>

1422
01:16:59.944 --> 01:17:01.942
<i>What's up? Going to
end the recording.</i>

1423
01:17:01.943 --> 01:17:03.318
<i>I think so.</i>

1424
01:17:03.319 --> 01:17:04.485
<i>I think so.</i>

1425
01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:07.442
<i>So this is at, uh, five,</i>

1426
01:17:07.443 --> 01:17:10.027
<i>let's call it 5:17 p.m.,</i>

1427
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:13.735
<i>ceasing recording on June third.</i>
