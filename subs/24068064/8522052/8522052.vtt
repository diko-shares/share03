00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:29.479
<i>And then he doubled down on that
just before the election took place</i>

2
00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:31.500
<i>and then talked about it again last week.</i>

3
00:00:31.583 --> 00:00:34.000
<i>Really extraordinary, the circumstances.</i>

4
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:35.625
<i>Remember, Hillary Clinton</i>

5
00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:37.833
<i>Secretary Clinton, just recently came out</i>

6
00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:41.041
<i>and said the Jim Comey letters
and what he said</i>

7
00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:43.292
<i>was one of the reasons
she lost the election.</i>

8
00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.834
<i>Now we're saying that he's been
fired for basically those decisions.</i>

9
00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:50.416
<i>I wanna read a letter
from President Trump</i>

10
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500
<i>released just moments ago.</i>

11
00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:55.549
<i>"Dear Director Comey, I have
received the attached letters</i>

12
00:00:55.584 --> 00:00:56.668
<i>from the Attorney General</i>

13
00:00:56.751 --> 00:00:58.605
<i>the Deputy Attorney General
of the United States</i>

14
00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.210
<i>recommending your dismissal</i>

15
00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:02.772
<i>as the Director of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</i>

16
00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:04.668
<i>I have accepted their recommendation</i>

17
00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:07.917
<i>and you are hereby terminated
and removed from office</i>

18
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.459
<i>effective immediately.</i>

19
00:01:09.543 --> 00:01:12.168
<i>While I greatly appreciate
you informing me</i>

20
00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:13.919
<i>on three separate occasions</i>

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.835
<i>that I am not under investigation</i>

22
00:01:16.502 --> 00:01:18.710
<i>I nevertheless concur with the judgment</i>

23
00:01:18.793 --> 00:01:20.252
<i>of the Department of Justice</i>

24
00:01:20.335 --> 00:01:22.835
<i>that you are not able
to effectively lead the Bureau.</i>

25
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:26.877
<i>It is essential that we find
new leadership for the FBI..."</i>

26
00:03:07.298 --> 00:03:09.381
This is my partner...
partner, Wally Taylor.

27
00:03:09.465 --> 00:03:10.673
Hey, how are you?

28
00:03:21.048 --> 00:03:22.248
<i>Hey.</i>

29
00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:23.956
<i>How are you?</i>

30
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.506
- Good. How you doing?
- Good.

31
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.290
How's your day today?

32
00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:34.382
It's pretty good.
Just got some groceries.

33
00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:37.583
All right.

34
00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:44.204
Let's show you who we are.

35
00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:06.325
Okay, well, the reason we're here today

36
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:08.790
is that we have a search warrant
for your house.

37
00:04:10.758 --> 00:04:11.800
Okay.

38
00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:14.675
All right. Do you know
what this might be about?

39
00:04:16.425 --> 00:04:18.176
I have no idea.

40
00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:20.426
Okay.

41
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.300
This is about possible mishandling
of classified information.

42
00:04:25.634 --> 00:04:26.925
Oh, my goodness. Okay.

43
00:04:28.843 --> 00:04:32.133
So, what we've got is,
again, got a warrant.

44
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.093
And I'm happy to show it to you.

45
00:04:41.592 --> 00:04:44.010
Kind of go over what's going on.

46
00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:46.510
Kind of get your side of it.

47
00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:49.593
And of course, you're completely
voluntary to talk to me.

48
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.678
We can talk here, or...

49
00:04:53.177 --> 00:04:54.987
Our office is about five minutes away.

50
00:04:55.636 --> 00:04:57.615
If you want to...
if you'd rather talk there

51
00:04:57.635 --> 00:04:58.874
then we can do either one.

52
00:04:59.177 --> 00:05:00.558
It makes no difference to me.

53
00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.148
- Okay.
- Do you have any pets?

54
00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.115
- I do. I have two pets.
- Because you've been gone awhile

55
00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:10.261
so do we maybe need to let them out

56
00:05:10.344 --> 00:05:12.159
and use the bathroom and stuff like that?

57
00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:13.844
I... do.

58
00:05:15.302 --> 00:05:18.073
Would you mind if I at least get
some perishables into the fridge?

59
00:05:18.093 --> 00:05:20.903
And we can do that too
but what we're gonna have to do is...

60
00:05:23.137 --> 00:05:24.337
Do you live by yourself?

61
00:05:26.053 --> 00:05:27.095
Yes.

62
00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:28.491
Okay. What we're gonna
have to do is

63
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:30.409
we're gonna have to go
into the house first

64
00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:32.096
make sure it's safe.

65
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.053
We have a search warrant,
so we're... we're going to.

66
00:05:39.094 --> 00:05:40.596
- Absolutely.
- Okay. And...

67
00:05:41.095 --> 00:05:43.284
What we'll do is we'll keep you
out here until we do that

68
00:05:43.304 --> 00:05:44.804
and once we secure it, we'll...

69
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.784
then we can kind of go from there, okay?

70
00:05:46.804 --> 00:05:48.004
Of course.

71
00:05:53.513 --> 00:05:54.888
So, is your dog friendly?

72
00:05:57.804 --> 00:06:01.221
Okay, well...
So... she doesn't...

73
00:06:02.638 --> 00:06:04.138
- like men.
- Okay.

74
00:06:04.514 --> 00:06:06.513
- So...
- So that's a problem.

75
00:06:06.597 --> 00:06:07.797
Yeah.

76
00:06:08.513 --> 00:06:10.180
- She may come towards you
- Okay.

77
00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:12.576
But she's never bitten anybody.
She's not aggressive.

78
00:06:12.596 --> 00:06:14.660
She's just got, you know,
a really good growl going.

79
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.743
- Okay.
- She'll probably hide under my desk.

80
00:06:16.763 --> 00:06:18.554
Do you have a leash or something...

81
00:06:18.638 --> 00:06:19.680
- I have a leash.
- Okay.

82
00:06:19.763 --> 00:06:21.138
I can get her leashed up.

83
00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:25.119
So what we might wanna do is
maybe let you go in there with her.

84
00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.286
You're not to touch anything else,
you're not to do anything else

85
00:06:27.306 --> 00:06:29.035
but get the dog and bring it out here.

86
00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.430
Are we cool?

87
00:06:31.472 --> 00:06:32.613
- Of course. I understand.
- Because otherwise

88
00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.972
if we have a problem,
we're not gonna do that.

89
00:06:35.056 --> 00:06:36.619
I can move her straight to the backyard.

90
00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:37.839
- Okay.
- Okay.

91
00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:39.465
House key?

92
00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:44.431
House key.

93
00:06:44.515 --> 00:06:46.202
We also have a warrant
to search the car, too.

94
00:06:46.222 --> 00:06:47.422
Do you have a cellphone?

95
00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:57.724
And we'll take that

96
00:06:57.807 --> 00:06:59.617
and we'll kind of go from there, okay?

97
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:02.120
But like he said,
we're completely voluntary

98
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.514
completely up to you on...

99
00:07:03.598 --> 00:07:05.995
But, you know, I think
maybe it'd be worth your time

100
00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:07.453
to listen at least for a little bit.

101
00:07:07.473 --> 00:07:08.933
- Definitely here...
- Okay?

102
00:07:09.016 --> 00:07:11.159
And we can kind of figure out
what's going on.

103
00:07:11.183 --> 00:07:13.807
- To comply.
- Okay.

104
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.283
Her leash is two feet inside the door
where I left it this morning.

105
00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:19.246
I can move her straight to the backyard.

106
00:07:19.266 --> 00:07:21.552
Are there any weapons
in the car or in the house?

107
00:07:23.266 --> 00:07:24.474
In the house, yes.

108
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:26.091
What do you have?

109
00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:30.184
I have an AR-15.

110
00:07:33.434 --> 00:07:34.634
Is it pink?

111
00:07:36.933 --> 00:07:38.133
It's pink.

112
00:07:38.392 --> 00:07:39.592
Okay.

113
00:07:39.933 --> 00:07:41.133
How'd you know?

114
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:46.976
I have a Glock 9 under the bed.

115
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.260
- And...
- Okay.

116
00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:50.725
A 15-gauge.

117
00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:52.767
You sound like my house.

118
00:07:53.184 --> 00:07:55.142
Okay. We're good then.

119
00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:58.309
All right. Just don't make
any movements for those

120
00:07:58.393 --> 00:07:59.593
and then we're...

121
00:08:00.142 --> 00:08:01.559
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

122
00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:03.467
I mean, we're all cool.

123
00:08:04.268 --> 00:08:05.518
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

124
00:08:06.934 --> 00:08:09.559
- I mean, kind of obvious.
- Yeah.

125
00:08:10.059 --> 00:08:13.298
You can put... There's a little
fenced-in area where you can put her.

126
00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:17.518
Yes, yes, and you won't even
take your eyes off me.

127
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:19.455
And we'll get water and stuff like that.

128
00:08:19.475 --> 00:08:21.851
And this other guy is with us as well.

129
00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:25.077
And we'll probably have a few more
people showing up here directly.

130
00:08:41.393 --> 00:08:43.143
Again, doesn't like men.

131
00:08:43.644 --> 00:08:45.229
Starting to see a trend here.

132
00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:47.359
Yeah, you all can come on out.
We found her.

133
00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:50.852
- What's her name?
- Mickey.

134
00:08:51.018 --> 00:08:52.935
- Hey, Mickey.
- Hey, there.

135
00:08:57.645 --> 00:08:59.598
She doesn't know what's going on, though.

136
00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:08.679
<i>There you go.</i>

137
00:09:17.562 --> 00:09:20.086
You don't have any weapons
or anything on you, do you?

138
00:09:20.645 --> 00:09:22.480
- No.
- None in the car?

139
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.437
In the car, no.

140
00:09:25.938 --> 00:09:27.138
Hey.

141
00:09:27.771 --> 00:09:30.979
- Hang on. Hang on just a second.
- Can I close the door for my cat?

142
00:09:33.438 --> 00:09:34.638
All right.

143
00:09:39.605 --> 00:09:41.606
'Cause that's all I care about right now.

144
00:09:45.438 --> 00:09:46.638
Okay.

145
00:09:47.104 --> 00:09:49.866
So the only thing in there now
and that's alive is the cat?

146
00:09:50.604 --> 00:09:51.647
Yes.

147
00:09:51.731 --> 00:09:52.931
There's not a person?

148
00:09:54.023 --> 00:09:55.223
No person.

149
00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:58.802
- They on their way?
- Yeah, they're pulling up.

150
00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:22.099
Why don't we...

151
00:10:23.107 --> 00:10:25.606
You wanna wait out here
with her for a minute?

152
00:10:25.689 --> 00:10:27.451
And then Joe and I will walk through.

153
00:10:28.189 --> 00:10:30.856
Again, just to explain,
we have a search warrant. It's...

154
00:10:31.315 --> 00:10:32.792
- I understand.
- It's en route.

155
00:11:16.816 --> 00:11:18.016
It's all right.

156
00:11:18.484 --> 00:11:19.584
They're just making sure...

157
00:11:19.609 --> 00:11:21.839
Just checking to make sure
there's nobody else in there.

158
00:11:21.859 --> 00:11:23.650
Nothing "surprise".

159
00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:25.714
Nothing surprise us,
or anything like that.

160
00:11:25.734 --> 00:11:26.934
- Yup.
- So.

161
00:11:27.525 --> 00:11:31.193
I wanna make this as easy
as possible for you guys.

162
00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:32.475
Okay, likewise.

163
00:11:33.317 --> 00:11:37.693
So hopefully, explain things,
get to figure this all out

164
00:11:37.776 --> 00:11:39.734
and wrap it up.

165
00:11:46.192 --> 00:11:48.402
How... how old is she?

166
00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:53.234
We don't know. She's one of those.

167
00:11:53.317 --> 00:11:56.484
Oh, yeah, yeah, my...
one of my dogs was a rescue.

168
00:11:57.236 --> 00:11:59.860
And when I got him, he wouldn't...

169
00:12:00.652 --> 00:12:02.510
I was the only guy who could touch him.

170
00:12:04.068 --> 00:12:06.319
Anybody else came in the house,
especially male

171
00:12:06.985 --> 00:12:08.403
he'd pee all over the place.

172
00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:11.219
But I could touch him, and it was fine.

173
00:12:13.777 --> 00:12:16.694
So whoever had him before was a real...

174
00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:19.395
real piece of work.

175
00:12:19.737 --> 00:12:23.028
Yeah, she was left in a kennel
and neglected her whole life.

176
00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:27.312
Why don't we...

177
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:30.217
Let's get the groceries,
throw them in the fridge real quick.

178
00:12:30.237 --> 00:12:32.190
Then we'll bring you back out here, okay?

179
00:13:18.904 --> 00:13:20.104
<i>Is that...</i>

180
00:13:20.572 --> 00:13:22.192
<i>No, that's it for the perishables.</i>

181
00:13:24.698 --> 00:13:25.898
Should be.

182
00:13:33.698 --> 00:13:34.898
The neighbors.

183
00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.948
All right, if you could
just step over. Just there.

184
00:13:48.739 --> 00:13:50.238
Yup, just stop right there.

185
00:13:54.531 --> 00:13:55.731
Look up here.

186
00:14:18.198 --> 00:14:19.484
There's a cat in the house.

187
00:14:20.116 --> 00:14:21.555
In the bed, or it's on the bed.

188
00:14:21.575 --> 00:14:23.741
- It's on the bed?
- Or it was on the bed.

189
00:14:24.532 --> 00:14:26.675
It'll probably go
under the bed at some point.

190
00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:29.283
And the dog is
in the backyard in the fence.

191
00:14:31.742 --> 00:14:32.942
Does...

192
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.900
Does she need water?

193
00:14:37.324 --> 00:14:38.524
She'll be fine.

194
00:14:38.909 --> 00:14:40.862
She's been inside all day with her water.

195
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:43.150
Okay.

196
00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:46.034
All righty.

197
00:14:48.075 --> 00:14:51.575
All right. So would you like
to talk here or talk...

198
00:14:52.534 --> 00:14:53.734
talk at the office?

199
00:14:54.409 --> 00:14:55.867
We can go ahead and talk here.

200
00:14:56.325 --> 00:14:57.525
You wanna talk here?

201
00:14:57.991 --> 00:14:59.191
- Sure.
- Okay.

202
00:15:00.327 --> 00:15:01.527
Let's...

203
00:15:02.992 --> 00:15:06.450
I'm trying to think if we have
any private place

204
00:15:06.534 --> 00:15:07.783
there in the house that...

205
00:15:07.867 --> 00:15:08.967
Do you have anything there in the house

206
00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:10.707
that we can kind of sit that's away?

207
00:15:13.285 --> 00:15:14.743
Away?

208
00:15:21.703 --> 00:15:24.577
There's one bedroom that's empty.
I don't...

209
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.326
I don't really like to go in there.

210
00:15:31.118 --> 00:15:32.318
Other than...

211
00:15:33.618 --> 00:15:37.993
I guess I don't really have anything
else other than that back room.

212
00:15:38.744 --> 00:15:39.944
That back room?

213
00:15:42.619 --> 00:15:44.869
Okay. And it's completely empty?

214
00:15:45.453 --> 00:15:47.494
Yeah. You'll go in there. There's...

215
00:15:47.786 --> 00:15:49.536
There's one dog kennel cage.

216
00:15:50.327 --> 00:15:51.994
Other than that, I don't use it.

217
00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:53.277
Okay. All right.

218
00:15:55.036 --> 00:15:57.243
You said you don't like to go in there?

219
00:15:57.327 --> 00:16:00.786
Oh, gosh, no, it's just weird.
It's just creepy.

220
00:16:01.203 --> 00:16:03.703
It's like an addition
to the back of the house

221
00:16:03.786 --> 00:16:06.203
behind the kitchen,
and it's always dirty.

222
00:16:06.577 --> 00:16:10.621
Okay. We can talk back there
if you're fine going back there.

223
00:16:11.745 --> 00:16:13.994
- It's...
- Yeah, we can go back there.

224
00:16:14.246 --> 00:16:17.830
Okay. All right.
There's a back room there

225
00:16:17.913 --> 00:16:19.267
- that we can...
- Kind of like the laundry?

226
00:16:19.287 --> 00:16:21.668
- That she'd like to talk in.
- Yeah, that'll work.

227
00:16:21.954 --> 00:16:23.288
It's too hot out here for...

228
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:27.080
Oh, I can make a pit stop
and take out the AC if you need that.

229
00:16:27.996 --> 00:16:29.080
Well, there's...

230
00:16:29.163 --> 00:16:31.184
They've gotta do their thing
for a minute and then we can go in.

231
00:16:31.204 --> 00:16:32.404
We can go in.

232
00:16:32.496 --> 00:16:33.786
Oh, get the password.

233
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.788
What's the... How do you open this?

234
00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:37.071
Just hang on.

235
00:16:38.205 --> 00:16:40.080
What kind, is it the iPhone?

236
00:17:07.957 --> 00:17:09.386
How long you lived in Augusta?

237
00:17:12.496 --> 00:17:17.705
I was out here October 2015
to April 2016.

238
00:17:18.748 --> 00:17:21.997
TDY, and then moved back
this past December.

239
00:17:22.123 --> 00:17:23.647
What... what do you think of it?

240
00:17:24.581 --> 00:17:27.081
Well, I willingly moved
back here as a civilian

241
00:17:27.164 --> 00:17:28.306
so I guess it must be all right.

242
00:17:28.331 --> 00:17:30.874
"Willingly."
You say that begrudgingly.

243
00:17:31.498 --> 00:17:32.698
Yeah. I mean...

244
00:17:33.123 --> 00:17:37.207
Originally, my big plan
is to deploy as a Pashto linguist

245
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.665
and be in Baghram for a bit.

246
00:17:38.748 --> 00:17:41.290
But then they hired me
out here for Farsi, so...

247
00:17:41.374 --> 00:17:43.124
Wait, you're Farsi and Pashto?

248
00:17:43.207 --> 00:17:45.082
Farsi, Dari, Pashto.

249
00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:46.541
Wow. That's...

250
00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:48.666
that's impressive.

251
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.833
I can barely...
I'm barely able to speak English.

252
00:17:53.582 --> 00:17:54.782
English is hard.

253
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.790
But yeah, I noticed that with...

254
00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:05.531
Especially here in Augusta

255
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.500
it's great for families

256
00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:10.208
but single, it's kind of tough.

257
00:18:10.624 --> 00:18:13.126
Like, I can't imagine coming back.

258
00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:15.993
What's the...

259
00:18:16.209 --> 00:18:18.833
Do you have a password or anything?

260
00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:21.124
- No password.
- How do we do it?

261
00:18:21.208 --> 00:18:22.647
Show me how to do it,
or tell me how to do it.

262
00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:24.751
- Swipe that?
- Yeah.

263
00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:26.575
No security?

264
00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:28.325
No security.

265
00:18:29.792 --> 00:18:31.355
You don't have a password
or anything that...

266
00:18:31.375 --> 00:18:33.876
No password, nothing.
Just anytime it locks

267
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.585
you just press the side there
until you see the circle

268
00:18:37.668 --> 00:18:39.042
and just slide up a bit.

269
00:18:40.125 --> 00:18:41.325
Okay, so it's...

270
00:18:44.501 --> 00:18:46.263
Did you already show her the warrant?

271
00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:48.576
No, I haven't.

272
00:18:51.376 --> 00:18:52.476
I was going to. We're gonna...

273
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:54.406
We're gonna sit down and show it to her.

274
00:19:08.252 --> 00:19:10.110
What made you get out of the Air Force?

275
00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:16.002
I... I wanted to deploy.

276
00:19:17.128 --> 00:19:19.253
I mean, I learned Pashto for a reason.

277
00:19:19.835 --> 00:19:22.550
And those opportunities
aren't in the Air Force right now.

278
00:19:23.253 --> 00:19:24.608
You'd figure that with that language

279
00:19:24.628 --> 00:19:26.524
- you could just... raise your hand
- Right?

280
00:19:26.544 --> 00:19:27.836
And they'd go, "Yeah, go."

281
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.545
Yeah, no, where I was in Maryland

282
00:19:30.629 --> 00:19:32.566
they only had one billet per year
for Afghanistan

283
00:19:32.586 --> 00:19:34.503
and it was all always airborne.

284
00:19:34.586 --> 00:19:35.920
Not even language.

285
00:19:36.377 --> 00:19:38.520
So I imagine people
were just crawling for it.

286
00:19:39.003 --> 00:19:41.587
Yeah, and I don't have
my airborne physical, so...

287
00:19:44.003 --> 00:19:46.044
Is your dog okay?
Does it need anything?

288
00:19:46.128 --> 00:19:47.328
She's fine.

289
00:19:47.545 --> 00:19:49.421
- She?
- Yeah. She's...

290
00:19:49.504 --> 00:19:51.463
If you can tell, we're all dog people.

291
00:19:53.879 --> 00:19:55.420
Yeah, I can... I can tell.

292
00:20:01.504 --> 00:20:04.457
Is she destructive at all when she...
when you leave her alone?

293
00:20:04.629 --> 00:20:06.920
Yeah. She's just a nervous chewer.

294
00:20:28.421 --> 00:20:29.621
Where do you CrossFit at?

295
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.755
I'm at SEC.

296
00:20:36.505 --> 00:20:40.256
I used to be on Enterprise Court

297
00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:43.089
off of Bobby Jones,
and then we moved to Wheeler.

298
00:20:46.006 --> 00:20:48.173
But my friend's re-opening the UnderBox.

299
00:20:48.589 --> 00:20:49.964
You... you gonna go off?

300
00:20:51.256 --> 00:20:53.903
Yeah. I'm just... I'm just waiting
for her gym to open to...

301
00:20:53.923 --> 00:20:55.123
to jump ship.

302
00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:59.673
I did it for, like, six months,
and I hurt myself.

303
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:02.465
Just every single day was just pain.

304
00:21:02.548 --> 00:21:04.048
- Yeah.
- So, I don't know.

305
00:21:04.132 --> 00:21:05.752
Guess I'm just too old and broken.

306
00:21:10.673 --> 00:21:13.048
Yeah, I always say that
I don't do CrossFit.

307
00:21:13.131 --> 00:21:14.779
- I do competitive power lifting.
- Okay.

308
00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:16.444
And then I do CrossFit
when it's convenient.

309
00:21:16.464 --> 00:21:17.664
No.

310
00:21:18.466 --> 00:21:19.666
What's your...

311
00:21:20.798 --> 00:21:21.998
Power lifting?

312
00:21:23.923 --> 00:21:27.008
What's your preference on?
What's your favorite stuff?

313
00:21:28.633 --> 00:21:31.049
I'm just all upper body.

314
00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:33.041
So, bench.

315
00:21:33.507 --> 00:21:35.446
It's kind of sad.
I tested my lifts this week

316
00:21:35.466 --> 00:21:37.405
because I have a competition
on June 24th.

317
00:21:37.425 --> 00:21:40.051
And my max bench is 180.

318
00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:41.404
And then my max back squat...

319
00:21:41.424 --> 00:21:45.383
I have... I have a back injury,
so my max back squat is 195.

320
00:21:45.465 --> 00:21:48.758
- But I don't...
- Still, still not shabby.

321
00:21:48.841 --> 00:21:50.758
No, it should not be that close.

322
00:21:50.841 --> 00:21:52.041
How'd you hurt your back?

323
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.551
Doing power cleans.

324
00:21:56.633 --> 00:22:00.676
My pelvis wasn't rotating,
so I separated that joint.

325
00:22:01.884 --> 00:22:03.300
- Sounds painful.
- Yeah.

326
00:22:04.092 --> 00:22:07.425
I did... I was doing box jumps,
and this hand just...

327
00:22:07.509 --> 00:22:11.758
I was doing it by myself,
hit the box and, I mean, I thought

328
00:22:11.842 --> 00:22:14.759
I just fractured every bone in the body.

329
00:22:15.301 --> 00:22:17.051
In the hand.

330
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.406
And I went to... I had to go
to the doctor to get the X-ray.

331
00:22:20.426 --> 00:22:22.046
They said, "So how'd you do this?"

332
00:22:22.426 --> 00:22:23.467
"CrossFit."

333
00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:25.011
Four times they asked me.

334
00:22:25.093 --> 00:22:27.570
Said, "No, I didn't get in a fight,
it was CrossFit."

335
00:22:30.301 --> 00:22:33.761
I thought I could see the bone
in my shin from that one.

336
00:22:34.303 --> 00:22:35.969
- Wow, what was that?
- Box jumps.

337
00:22:36.051 --> 00:22:37.843
Just missed the box.

338
00:22:37.927 --> 00:22:40.499
That's a moment you really hope,
"Did anybody see that?

339
00:22:40.678 --> 00:22:42.155
I really hope nobody saw that."

340
00:22:59.302 --> 00:23:01.594
So I do have to ask, just...

341
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.219
however this goes, I don't wanna
make any assumptions, but...

342
00:23:07.678 --> 00:23:09.157
is this gonna be a thing where, like

343
00:23:09.177 --> 00:23:10.657
I brought my phone into the building

344
00:23:10.677 --> 00:23:12.916
and I don't see that phone
for three weeks or...

345
00:23:13.763 --> 00:23:15.784
- We'll go over the warrant itself...
- We have a warrant for the phone.

346
00:23:15.804 --> 00:23:17.658
Yeah, no, and I don't...
I don't wanna make any assumptions

347
00:23:17.678 --> 00:23:19.302
or anything like that, just...

348
00:23:20.386 --> 00:23:23.512
I'm teaching yoga tomorrow

349
00:23:23.595 --> 00:23:25.263
and my phone has the music on it.

350
00:23:34.013 --> 00:23:35.213
Okay.

351
00:23:36.972 --> 00:23:39.929
I mean, there are
bigger problems in the world

352
00:23:40.012 --> 00:23:42.054
so I can make do, I guess.

353
00:23:42.138 --> 00:23:43.804
Yeah. And, we'll...

354
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.288
we'll talk about that once we sit down.

355
00:23:46.554 --> 00:23:49.554
Is there a... Do you have
just a few chairs, like

356
00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:52.951
kitchen table chairs that we can pull
into that... that back room?

357
00:23:52.971 --> 00:23:54.493
Or are we gonna be sitting on the floor?

358
00:23:54.513 --> 00:23:55.713
No.

359
00:23:57.055 --> 00:23:58.255
Yeah, I...

360
00:23:58.763 --> 00:24:01.139
If you wanna sit,
I'm not too big on furniture.

361
00:24:54.974 --> 00:24:58.556
Would it be too much to ask if I can
get the cat on a leash and tied up?

362
00:24:58.641 --> 00:24:59.841
Just...

363
00:25:02.225 --> 00:25:05.058
I just don't wanna be, like,
asking someone in the FBI

364
00:25:05.141 --> 00:25:07.999
to keep the front door closed
if you guys are doing a search.

365
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.558
I don't see an issue.

366
00:25:11.434 --> 00:25:13.475
Where is the cat right now?

367
00:25:13.558 --> 00:25:14.955
- In the bedroom.
- On the bed.

368
00:25:14.975 --> 00:25:16.766
- In the bed.
- Okay.

369
00:25:17.016 --> 00:25:19.517
- Still in the bed?
- Yeah, I think so.

370
00:25:27.934 --> 00:25:31.100
Where... Just safety's sake,
where are the...

371
00:25:31.767 --> 00:25:33.081
- There's your weapon and the...
- The weapon.

372
00:25:33.101 --> 00:25:35.391
It's right by the little table
with the lamp

373
00:25:35.475 --> 00:25:36.675
right under the bed.

374
00:25:37.141 --> 00:25:39.289
- Your cat's under there.
- He's under the bed.

375
00:25:39.309 --> 00:25:40.934
Or she's under the bed.

376
00:25:41.727 --> 00:25:43.976
- The AR's in the case in here?
- Yes.

377
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.600
Where's the other gun?

378
00:25:45.684 --> 00:25:48.304
It's behind it, more against
the wall in the black case.

379
00:25:48.601 --> 00:25:49.809
Can you get your cat?

380
00:25:50.393 --> 00:25:51.997
- Do you wanna get your cat?
- Can you...

381
00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:53.997
- Do you wanna get your cat?
- Do you wanna get your cat?

382
00:25:54.017 --> 00:25:55.217
Get your cat.

383
00:26:23.935 --> 00:26:25.135
<i>All right, she's good.</i>

384
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.311
<i>Okay.</i>

385
00:26:27.478 --> 00:26:28.678
<i>All right.</i>

386
00:26:29.144 --> 00:26:30.344
<i>You wanna go back here?</i>

387
00:26:30.644 --> 00:26:32.728
<i>Yeah, you can go ahead
and go back in there.</i>

388
00:27:13.687 --> 00:27:15.980
This room is dirty. I'm so sorry.

389
00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:31.139
All righty.

390
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.979
So, again, my name is Justin.

391
00:27:36.772 --> 00:27:39.397
You probably don't remember
any idea of who I am. So...

392
00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.439
Justin Garrick with the FBI.

393
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.106
This is Wally. He's my partner.

394
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.335
So what I wanna do
is kind of explain that

395
00:27:47.355 --> 00:27:49.165
you know, we do have a search warrant.

396
00:27:49.688 --> 00:27:52.420
You're welcome to see the warrant,
you're welcome to read the warrant

397
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.295
and then explain a little bit about it.

398
00:27:54.315 --> 00:27:56.772
Now, if you're willing to talk to me...

399
00:27:57.564 --> 00:28:00.855
like to kind of go through
just how this started and, you know

400
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.440
give your... your side of it.

401
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.750
We'll figure out what's going on here.

402
00:28:04.773 --> 00:28:07.481
Does that sound...
sound good to you?

403
00:28:10.065 --> 00:28:11.265
Okay.

404
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:13.849
Okay?

405
00:28:15.899 --> 00:28:17.099
Yes.

406
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:19.890
Now, I'm gonna take...

407
00:28:22.065 --> 00:28:23.265
Right here...

408
00:28:23.483 --> 00:28:25.524
I'm gonna take notes.

409
00:28:26.482 --> 00:28:29.064
Just random basis.
You got to take notes.

410
00:28:33.859 --> 00:28:36.233
Do you need water or anything?
Are you thirsty?

411
00:28:39.732 --> 00:28:41.923
You're what...
If you need water, shout it out.

412
00:28:45.192 --> 00:28:46.716
Okay. I'll let you know. Thanks.

413
00:28:47.609 --> 00:28:49.898
- Are you thirsty?
- Not right now.

414
00:28:50.525 --> 00:28:51.776
Okay. All right.

415
00:28:54.651 --> 00:28:56.881
If you need to use the restroom,
any of that, let me know.

416
00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:58.942
It's not a big deal. Okay?

417
00:28:59.817 --> 00:29:04.525
Okay. So, currently, you're employed
as a contract linguist

418
00:29:05.108 --> 00:29:07.650
- with Pluribus?
- Yes.

419
00:29:08.484 --> 00:29:10.360
I'm sorry, what languages you said?

420
00:29:10.901 --> 00:29:13.651
- I heard...
- Farsi, Dari, Pashto.

421
00:29:17.735 --> 00:29:20.193
Okay. Any other?

422
00:29:23.651 --> 00:29:24.692
No.

423
00:29:24.776 --> 00:29:27.859
I'm kidding. I think that's enough.

424
00:29:29.652 --> 00:29:31.027
That's really impressive.

425
00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:33.859
And you live here, sorry, by yourself?

426
00:29:35.234 --> 00:29:37.443
- Yes.
- Okay.

427
00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:41.510
This is really hard
without a table and chairs.

428
00:29:43.444 --> 00:29:44.693
I'm so sorry.

429
00:29:45.026 --> 00:29:47.860
It's... You don't have to apol...
It's your house.

430
00:29:49.778 --> 00:29:52.527
If you do feel like, you know,
you wanna sit or anything

431
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.320
we'll sit, okay?

432
00:29:54.402 --> 00:29:57.260
If you sit on the floor,
I'll sit on the floor, I don't care.

433
00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.270
Okay.

434
00:30:02.028 --> 00:30:03.127
And I'm serious about that.

435
00:30:03.152 --> 00:30:05.444
If you wanna sit, please,
I'll sit down too.

436
00:30:07.611 --> 00:30:08.811
Okay.

437
00:30:09.654 --> 00:30:13.736
So, again, we have a warrant.
And it's... Do you...

438
00:30:14.319 --> 00:30:15.519
Would you like to see it?

439
00:30:16.986 --> 00:30:18.695
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

440
00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:23.925
That just gave us the authority
to search the residence

441
00:30:23.945 --> 00:30:25.145
the car, and then you.

442
00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:36.779
"125 pounds." You guys flatter me.

443
00:30:39.946 --> 00:30:41.946
Sorry. I have a sense of humor.

444
00:30:42.487 --> 00:30:44.821
- It was on your driver's license.
- That's right.

445
00:30:46.238 --> 00:30:47.863
Okay, well, I lied.

446
00:30:48.987 --> 00:30:50.187
Don't we all?

447
00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.029
Attachment B just explains the property

448
00:30:55.113 --> 00:30:57.177
that we're authorized
to search for and seize.

449
00:30:57.197 --> 00:30:58.739
Any questions about any of that?

450
00:31:04.613 --> 00:31:06.572
- No.
- Okay.

451
00:31:07.571 --> 00:31:09.476
We'll just leave a copy of that for you.

452
00:31:10.072 --> 00:31:11.280
Yeah, we'll leave a copy.

453
00:31:50.032 --> 00:31:54.033
So, all this stems
from a report that we received

454
00:31:54.116 --> 00:31:56.741
that you had mishandled
classified information.

455
00:31:58.325 --> 00:32:00.241
My question is

456
00:32:00.324 --> 00:32:02.407
does that ring
any bells to you whatsoever?

457
00:32:09.324 --> 00:32:10.616
It does now.

458
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.950
When I started working at White Law, I...

459
00:32:17.157 --> 00:32:19.201
Do you guys know PKI passwords?

460
00:32:19.991 --> 00:32:21.741
So I had a printed out email

461
00:32:22.199 --> 00:32:24.472
and I put it in a folder,
I didn't have a desk yet

462
00:32:24.492 --> 00:32:25.782
so I took it with me.

463
00:32:26.242 --> 00:32:28.616
And passed through security,
and went to Starbucks

464
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:32.325
and when I came back,
they searched through it.

465
00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:36.158
And unfortunately, the email
I had printed out was classified.

466
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:38.325
And they filed a report for that.

467
00:32:38.699 --> 00:32:39.742
Okay. All right.

468
00:32:39.826 --> 00:32:42.409
And what's your work role there
at White Law?

469
00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:46.575
Currently, I translate
graphics documents. And...

470
00:32:48.576 --> 00:32:50.493
- Yeah, that's all I do.
- Okay.

471
00:32:50.992 --> 00:32:52.202
From Farsi to English.

472
00:32:53.285 --> 00:32:57.451
So you're assigned to a specific
section, I guess, or a group?

473
00:32:57.534 --> 00:33:01.201
Yes. It's the Iranian
Aerospace Forces Office.

474
00:33:01.285 --> 00:33:03.714
Have you been assigned there
your entire time there?

475
00:33:03.827 --> 00:33:05.027
Yes, since February.

476
00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.110
Okay.

477
00:33:08.368 --> 00:33:10.555
Is there any other issues
or anything you're aware of

478
00:33:10.575 --> 00:33:12.861
that might explain
why that report was generated?

479
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.910
Like, maybe this, maybe that?

480
00:33:17.118 --> 00:33:18.318
No.

481
00:33:19.785 --> 00:33:20.985
No? Okay.

482
00:33:21.619 --> 00:33:25.161
So you currently hold
Top Secret-SCI clearance?

483
00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:26.610
Yes.

484
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.946
How long have you had that?

485
00:33:31.077 --> 00:33:34.869
I would say since January 2013.

486
00:33:35.411 --> 00:33:37.316
- While you were in the Air Force?
- Yes.

487
00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.995
So you kept it through...

488
00:33:42.619 --> 00:33:43.819
Through the...

489
00:33:44.287 --> 00:33:45.487
Did you...

490
00:33:51.537 --> 00:33:53.536
When did you process
out of the Air Force?

491
00:33:53.619 --> 00:33:56.120
I processed out of the Air Force...

492
00:33:57.204 --> 00:33:58.404
December...

493
00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:02.162
December 14, 2016.

494
00:34:02.496 --> 00:34:04.911
And up until that time,
I was looking for contracts

495
00:34:04.994 --> 00:34:06.788
to try and get my clearance renewed.

496
00:34:06.871 --> 00:34:09.204
So your clearance
just kind of passed through.

497
00:34:09.288 --> 00:34:10.496
It passed through, yeah.

498
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:14.570
Okay. All right.

499
00:34:15.871 --> 00:34:18.788
So, again, as far as you're aware

500
00:34:18.872 --> 00:34:20.968
you haven't committed
any security violations

501
00:34:20.997 --> 00:34:25.079
or anything you're aware of,
other than this... this PKI thing?

502
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:29.497
Other than the PKI thing, no.

503
00:34:36.955 --> 00:34:38.155
I mean...

504
00:34:39.831 --> 00:34:43.289
I do print out documents at work

505
00:34:43.663 --> 00:34:47.455
because it's easier for me
to translate them by hand.

506
00:34:47.538 --> 00:34:49.015
But then I put them in the box.

507
00:34:49.498 --> 00:34:51.290
And then I don't get it mixed up

508
00:34:51.372 --> 00:34:54.164
with, like, my classified notes
because they...

509
00:34:56.289 --> 00:34:58.665
I use pretty paper.

510
00:34:59.623 --> 00:35:01.373
So I don't take out white paper.

511
00:35:04.997 --> 00:35:06.197
Got it.

512
00:35:06.289 --> 00:35:08.623
And I know it sounds really dumb,
but it's just...

513
00:35:09.749 --> 00:35:11.332
how I can do it now.

514
00:35:11.957 --> 00:35:15.081
And after that stupid
PKI thing, I was like

515
00:35:15.164 --> 00:35:17.582
"No more white paper
out of the building."

516
00:35:17.873 --> 00:35:20.666
You... said you printed out stuff?

517
00:35:20.874 --> 00:35:22.957
- Yeah. I printed out...
- Is there...

518
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.249
Why did that come to mind
as far as security?

519
00:35:30.289 --> 00:35:31.489
I guess...

520
00:35:32.373 --> 00:35:34.707
I'm just trying to think about...

521
00:35:35.957 --> 00:35:37.166
actual paper.

522
00:35:38.832 --> 00:35:40.016
I can't imagine any other way

523
00:35:40.041 --> 00:35:42.041
to get things
out of the building, I guess.

524
00:35:42.833 --> 00:35:44.833
I mean, I'm old-fashioned.

525
00:35:44.915 --> 00:35:46.666
So, thinking about that

526
00:35:48.166 --> 00:35:50.248
and just with this PKI thing

527
00:35:50.666 --> 00:35:52.897
just making sure I don't accidentally
have anything in my lunchbox

528
00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:53.958
or anything like that.

529
00:35:54.042 --> 00:35:55.898
- Nothing got out of the building?
- Nothing.

530
00:35:55.918 --> 00:35:57.605
You didn't carry anything
out of the building?

531
00:35:57.625 --> 00:36:00.750
No, and I definitely let everything
get searched all the time.

532
00:36:00.833 --> 00:36:03.208
So I haven't had any other accidents.

533
00:36:06.042 --> 00:36:07.614
Do you work on any other matters?

534
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.200
No.

535
00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:10.492
Okay.

536
00:36:11.542 --> 00:36:14.668
Have you ever inadvertently,
either by accident

537
00:36:14.751 --> 00:36:16.585
or intentionally, or whatever

538
00:36:17.626 --> 00:36:20.583
gone outside your need-to-know on items?

539
00:36:21.458 --> 00:36:23.708
Outside my need-to-know on items?

540
00:36:27.001 --> 00:36:31.167
I do, from time to time,
look at a website called "My Online."

541
00:36:31.792 --> 00:36:34.709
- It's drone feeds.
- Okay.

542
00:36:34.793 --> 00:36:38.501
I used to work a drone mission,
so it's all Afghan stuff, but...

543
00:36:39.126 --> 00:36:40.793
other than that, just...

544
00:36:42.251 --> 00:36:45.169
reading basic news articles on NSA Net.

545
00:36:45.252 --> 00:36:47.024
But I've never accessed
anything that's outside of...

546
00:36:47.044 --> 00:36:50.169
Okay. Have you ever
gone searching for stuff

547
00:36:50.252 --> 00:36:53.169
that's not related
to your... your work role?

548
00:36:53.253 --> 00:36:54.453
No.

549
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.160
Okay.

550
00:36:58.586 --> 00:37:02.293
You've kind of already answered this,
but outside of the PKI

551
00:37:02.377 --> 00:37:06.878
have you ever taken anything
outside of the NSA facility?

552
00:37:07.628 --> 00:37:08.828
- No.
- No?

553
00:37:09.335 --> 00:37:11.649
Have you downloaded anything?
Emailed anything out?

554
00:37:11.669 --> 00:37:13.586
- No.
- No? Okay.

555
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.419
Have you ever discussed
any classified material

556
00:37:16.503 --> 00:37:19.795
with anybody who wouldn't have the
prior US government authorization?

557
00:37:20.295 --> 00:37:21.984
Who wouldn't have the clearance
or anything like that?

558
00:37:22.004 --> 00:37:23.983
Who wouldn't have the clearance
and the need to know?

559
00:37:24.003 --> 00:37:25.203
No.

560
00:37:25.837 --> 00:37:27.037
No?

561
00:37:27.628 --> 00:37:28.828
Okay.

562
00:37:29.211 --> 00:37:32.047
Not many people ask
about Iranian aerospace.

563
00:37:32.129 --> 00:37:34.254
So, I lucked out.

564
00:37:35.254 --> 00:37:38.836
So you never discussed work
or anything classified with anybody?

565
00:37:41.339 --> 00:37:42.539
Nuh-uh.

566
00:37:45.505 --> 00:37:46.705
How's the neighborhood?

567
00:37:50.879 --> 00:37:53.380
I did not look at a map
when I signed the lease

568
00:37:53.463 --> 00:37:55.504
but I am well armed.

569
00:37:56.338 --> 00:37:57.538
You seem to be.

570
00:37:58.462 --> 00:37:59.662
What's your plans?

571
00:37:59.796 --> 00:38:00.897
You gonna stay in the house

572
00:38:00.922 --> 00:38:02.064
or you gonna move somewhere else, or...

573
00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:04.005
Did you sign a lease, I guess?

574
00:38:04.089 --> 00:38:07.338
I signed a lease, and I would
only break it if I get a deployment.

575
00:38:07.421 --> 00:38:08.621
Yeah.

576
00:38:09.129 --> 00:38:11.510
Have you had any issues here,
since you moved here?

577
00:38:12.131 --> 00:38:14.339
- I did, yeah.
- What happened?

578
00:38:15.631 --> 00:38:18.421
I was coming home
from a concert in Atlanta.

579
00:38:18.505 --> 00:38:20.006
It was 3.00am, and...

580
00:38:21.131 --> 00:38:24.257
there was a guy standing on the street

581
00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.674
and I wanted to make sure
that he didn't see me go

582
00:38:26.755 --> 00:38:29.803
from, like, my car to my door.
And I thought I timed it out well.

583
00:38:30.131 --> 00:38:32.417
But then I was standing
at the sink getting water

584
00:38:32.464 --> 00:38:34.673
and then someone starts
knocking at the door...

585
00:38:36.548 --> 00:38:37.748
Do you have a toothpick?

586
00:38:45.216 --> 00:38:47.299
It's 3.00am

587
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:50.757
and my keys and my phone were by the door

588
00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.236
'cause that's where I dropped them,
because I had to pee.

589
00:38:53.256 --> 00:38:57.507
So... very glad to have
a Glock 9 in the back.

590
00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:58.633
Oh, yeah.

591
00:38:58.717 --> 00:39:00.799
- Did not sleep.
- I'm sure.

592
00:39:02.465 --> 00:39:03.923
Anything other than that?

593
00:39:05.758 --> 00:39:06.958
Other than that...

594
00:39:09.883 --> 00:39:11.083
There's this...

595
00:39:13.049 --> 00:39:15.548
People always ask
if you want your lawn done

596
00:39:15.632 --> 00:39:17.757
and someone came and mowed my lawn

597
00:39:18.217 --> 00:39:19.737
while I was in Belize last week.

598
00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:22.216
So... not really cool with that.

599
00:39:22.549 --> 00:39:23.591
I imagine not.

600
00:39:23.758 --> 00:39:25.779
They're probably gonna
come by and knock on the door

601
00:39:25.799 --> 00:39:27.419
- and ask for compensation.
- Yeah.

602
00:39:27.884 --> 00:39:30.217
I mean, if it's the same guy
I paid last time

603
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.009
he's, like, this little old man,
like, in his eighties

604
00:39:33.092 --> 00:39:34.966
so I won't really be mad.

605
00:39:35.424 --> 00:39:36.624
- But...
- When...

606
00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:38.676
When did you go to Belize?

607
00:39:40.385 --> 00:39:44.799
I left on Saturday morning,
and flew back Monday morning.

608
00:39:46.258 --> 00:39:47.458
Last weekend.

609
00:39:48.968 --> 00:39:50.492
That was a quick trip to Belize.

610
00:39:52.884 --> 00:39:54.216
It was a quick trip.

611
00:39:54.925 --> 00:39:56.306
What'd you go down there for?

612
00:39:56.676 --> 00:39:59.760
I wanted to see the Mayan pyramids.

613
00:39:59.843 --> 00:40:01.043
Okay.

614
00:40:01.593 --> 00:40:03.550
- So, yeah.
- That's pretty cool.

615
00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:06.009
I didn't have any leave

616
00:40:06.093 --> 00:40:09.469
so I was tired of waiting
for the stars to align

617
00:40:09.552 --> 00:40:11.468
- so I just said...
- Sure.

618
00:40:11.552 --> 00:40:13.093
"Got three days, let's do it."

619
00:40:13.176 --> 00:40:14.510
- That's cool.
- Fair enough.

620
00:40:14.718 --> 00:40:16.528
Spur of the moment.
That's pretty cool.

621
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:19.368
Did you go down there by yourself or...

622
00:40:20.094 --> 00:40:21.677
Yeah. By myself.

623
00:40:22.385 --> 00:40:25.886
Okay. Did you do any tours
or anything down there?

624
00:40:26.928 --> 00:40:28.128
I did.

625
00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:34.427
The first day, I went on,
like, an Altun Ha tour.

626
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:36.994
That was one of the first sites.

627
00:40:37.053 --> 00:40:39.928
And then the second day we did...

628
00:40:40.385 --> 00:40:43.553
we took a boat on a river
down to the Lemani Pyramids

629
00:40:43.636 --> 00:40:45.017
and then we came back, and...

630
00:40:46.553 --> 00:40:47.753
Yeah.

631
00:40:49.137 --> 00:40:50.337
Okay.

632
00:40:51.719 --> 00:40:53.387
Saw a bunch of monkeys.

633
00:40:54.929 --> 00:40:56.262
So you're positive

634
00:40:56.678 --> 00:40:59.917
you've never printed anything out
that was outside of your work role?

635
00:41:05.262 --> 00:41:06.513
I'm trying to think.

636
00:41:10.138 --> 00:41:12.553
Because there's... there's...

637
00:41:12.887 --> 00:41:14.264
There's NSA Pulse

638
00:41:14.347 --> 00:41:18.679
and from time to time,
I do print out articles from that

639
00:41:18.762 --> 00:41:20.304
and use as scratch paper.

640
00:41:21.678 --> 00:41:24.012
That sounds really dumb.

641
00:41:25.472 --> 00:41:26.572
Now that I'm thinking about it

642
00:41:26.597 --> 00:41:29.054
the things that I did were really dumb.

643
00:41:29.554 --> 00:41:31.659
But then I always threw it out
in the burn bin.

644
00:41:31.679 --> 00:41:32.721
Okay.

645
00:41:32.804 --> 00:41:35.090
What kind of articles
from Pulse do you pull out?

646
00:41:36.388 --> 00:41:38.971
<i>Usually reference material about, like...</i>

647
00:41:40.471 --> 00:41:41.680
<i>Just making sure, like</i>

648
00:41:41.762 --> 00:41:44.637
<i>so many references that
I keep having to relook up...</i>

649
00:41:44.721 --> 00:41:48.014
So that's probably fraud,
waste, and abuse right there.

650
00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:50.711
We're not worried about
fraud, waste, and abuse.

651
00:41:51.597 --> 00:41:52.797
Okay.

652
00:41:52.931 --> 00:41:54.131
No.

653
00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:58.098
I use a lot of papers.

654
00:41:58.556 --> 00:42:00.513
But nothing outside of Iranian stuff

655
00:42:00.597 --> 00:42:03.098
or anything other than that.

656
00:42:03.182 --> 00:42:05.014
And never outside of the building.

657
00:42:05.098 --> 00:42:06.298
Okay.

658
00:42:06.681 --> 00:42:07.881
Reality

659
00:42:08.723 --> 00:42:11.222
what if I said that I have
the information to suggest

660
00:42:11.306 --> 00:42:14.116
that you did print out stuff
that was outside of that scope?

661
00:42:17.765 --> 00:42:19.473
I mean, I would...

662
00:42:20.514 --> 00:42:21.766
I would try to remember.

663
00:42:23.141 --> 00:42:24.182
Okay.

664
00:42:24.264 --> 00:42:27.848
What if I said that
you printed out information

665
00:42:27.931 --> 00:42:30.182
related to reports on...

666
00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:38.841
Reality...

667
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:44.808
we obviously know a lot more than
what we're telling you at this point.

668
00:42:46.724 --> 00:42:48.495
And I think... I think
you know a lot more

669
00:42:48.515 --> 00:42:50.468
than what you're telling us
at this point.

670
00:42:51.017 --> 00:42:53.017
I don't want you to go down
the wrong road.

671
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:55.434
I think you need to stop

672
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:59.224
and think about what you're saying
and what you're doing.

673
00:43:00.434 --> 00:43:04.767
I think it's an opportunity
to maybe tell the truth. Because...

674
00:43:05.934 --> 00:43:08.933
telling a... telling a lie
to an FBI agent

675
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.124
is not gonna be the right thing.

676
00:43:11.935 --> 00:43:13.135
Okay?

677
00:43:13.392 --> 00:43:15.309
You know, and again

678
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:17.767
we're here voluntarily.

679
00:43:18.683 --> 00:43:21.393
You're talking voluntarily.

680
00:43:21.892 --> 00:43:25.018
I'm not asking you,
forcing you to do anything.

681
00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.300
But think.

682
00:43:27.059 --> 00:43:29.601
That's what I'm asking you
to do, is think.

683
00:43:31.142 --> 00:43:32.342
So...

684
00:43:32.894 --> 00:43:34.810
think about what he just asked you

685
00:43:35.434 --> 00:43:36.634
and let... you know.

686
00:43:47.851 --> 00:43:50.519
There was one I printed out
because I wanted to read it.

687
00:43:56.519 --> 00:43:58.186
Can you remember what day that was?

688
00:43:59.853 --> 00:44:01.768
I might mess up the dates, but...

689
00:44:03.435 --> 00:44:06.395
late... late March, early...

690
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:09.644
- early April?
- And what was it?

691
00:44:11.768 --> 00:44:13.686
It was an NSA Pulse article about...

692
00:44:18.144 --> 00:44:19.344
Okay.

693
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.720
And...

694
00:44:21.687 --> 00:44:22.937
I did print that one out.

695
00:44:25.936 --> 00:44:27.136
Okay.

696
00:44:28.271 --> 00:44:29.471
Why...

697
00:44:30.603 --> 00:44:32.080
Why did you print that one out?

698
00:44:34.228 --> 00:44:35.603
'Cause I wanted to read it.

699
00:44:36.853 --> 00:44:39.771
The way I downloaded it,
it was hard to read so...

700
00:44:42.854 --> 00:44:45.270
It looked like a piece of history,
you know?

701
00:44:45.353 --> 00:44:47.401
And I wanted it on my desk
for, like, a day.

702
00:44:48.813 --> 00:44:50.479
Did you... How did you find it?

703
00:44:52.645 --> 00:44:55.271
So if you go on Pulse, there's a...

704
00:44:56.604 --> 00:44:59.980
At the top right, they have
a tab that says "Articles."

705
00:45:00.063 --> 00:45:02.564
And I scroll through those from...

706
00:45:04.354 --> 00:45:07.001
I don't know if you guys saw the one
about the miniature ponies.

707
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:08.396
- But...
- I missed that one.

708
00:45:08.479 --> 00:45:11.396
Yeah, no, that was number one
for, like, a year.

709
00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.479
So, obviously, I go to check
to see if there's any other gems.

710
00:45:14.563 --> 00:45:17.730
And... and then there was that one,
and I saw it on the news

711
00:45:17.813 --> 00:45:19.013
and I was just...

712
00:45:19.438 --> 00:45:22.105
Like, yeah, I wanted to read it.

713
00:45:23.231 --> 00:45:24.431
So, yeah.

714
00:45:25.106 --> 00:45:27.106
- Okay.
- What did you do with the article?

715
00:45:27.481 --> 00:45:30.314
I kept it on my desk
for, like, three days.

716
00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.140
I'm gonna be honest...

717
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:42.357
I only read, like, half of it.

718
00:45:43.564 --> 00:45:45.232
It was the stupidest thing ever.

719
00:45:45.689 --> 00:45:47.928
And then... and then
I burn bagged it in the box

720
00:45:47.981 --> 00:45:49.898
with the slat next to the fridge.

721
00:45:50.649 --> 00:45:51.849
Okay.

722
00:45:52.315 --> 00:45:53.879
Did you print out any other articles?

723
00:45:53.899 --> 00:45:55.816
No, no, I just... only the one.

724
00:45:55.899 --> 00:45:58.273
Okay, talking around it.

725
00:45:59.481 --> 00:46:01.815
You're pretty sure it was
late April, early March?

726
00:46:01.856 --> 00:46:03.571
Think about... try to remember, like

727
00:46:03.607 --> 00:46:05.171
- details in your personal life.
- I know.

728
00:46:05.191 --> 00:46:06.732
I... I'm trying. I... I don't...

729
00:46:08.107 --> 00:46:09.565
I don't... I don't remember.

730
00:46:09.982 --> 00:46:13.691
I got in a fight with the boyfriend
that week.

731
00:46:13.774 --> 00:46:16.358
God, when did I break up with him?
I don't remember.

732
00:46:16.983 --> 00:46:19.031
God, I'm... I'm really
blanking on what week

733
00:46:19.107 --> 00:46:20.837
what the weekend was like before that.

734
00:46:20.857 --> 00:46:22.273
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

735
00:46:22.356 --> 00:46:24.317
I'm trying. God.

736
00:46:25.358 --> 00:46:27.942
Yeah, mid-April is all I'm thinking.

737
00:46:28.399 --> 00:46:29.440
Okay. All right.

738
00:46:29.524 --> 00:46:31.921
What if I tell you that
I know that you searched for

739
00:46:31.941 --> 00:46:34.401
and printed out a document
on the 9th of May?

740
00:46:35.983 --> 00:46:37.192
9th of May.

741
00:46:39.192 --> 00:46:40.392
Let me see.

742
00:46:40.816 --> 00:46:44.108
The CrossFit competition was on the 12th.

743
00:46:45.401 --> 00:46:47.151
God, was it really that late?

744
00:46:48.484 --> 00:46:50.714
I mean, I can't argue that.
If you know, you know.

745
00:46:50.734 --> 00:46:52.609
- Okay.
- I mean, obviously, you know.

746
00:46:52.692 --> 00:46:55.068
I mean, I just... I can't imagine.

747
00:46:55.983 --> 00:46:58.567
I mean, I guess
we're already June already.

748
00:47:00.983 --> 00:47:03.610
It's been a really bad month for me.

749
00:47:03.694 --> 00:47:06.276
Do you remember
what you did to get to that article?

750
00:47:07.735 --> 00:47:11.276
Other than seeing it
on the front page or linking it...

751
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:14.231
Do you remember what search terms
you might have put in?

752
00:47:23.526 --> 00:47:24.726
Probably...

753
00:47:27.859 --> 00:47:29.611
I'm not very sophisticated.

754
00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:31.310
Okay. So...

755
00:47:32.278 --> 00:47:33.659
you did print out a document.

756
00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:37.110
An intelligence report.
You do recall that?

757
00:47:38.318 --> 00:47:40.320
Yeah, I do remember now, yeah.

758
00:47:40.778 --> 00:47:42.736
Okay. What did you do
with that report?

759
00:47:45.485 --> 00:47:47.818
I kept it on my desk for three days

760
00:47:48.444 --> 00:47:51.362
and I thought it was interesting,
and I would read it

761
00:47:51.445 --> 00:47:54.153
and then I said, "No, I should
not have this on my desk"

762
00:47:54.236 --> 00:47:55.760
and so I put it in the burn bag.

763
00:47:55.986 --> 00:47:57.186
Where's the burn bag?

764
00:47:57.778 --> 00:47:58.978
Okay...

765
00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:01.445
It's in the break room.

766
00:48:03.071 --> 00:48:06.778
It's the white box with the little
slat on it, one over from the fridge.

767
00:48:06.862 --> 00:48:08.815
So you just slide it in there,
and then...

768
00:48:08.862 --> 00:48:10.386
- And it's taken care of?
- Yeah.

769
00:48:12.488 --> 00:48:14.113
Okay, Reality.

770
00:48:15.446 --> 00:48:17.175
Are you sure that's what you did with it?

771
00:48:17.195 --> 00:48:18.395
Yes.

772
00:48:19.404 --> 00:48:20.604
You're positive?

773
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.009
- Yes.
- You didn't take it

774
00:48:23.029 --> 00:48:24.655
- out of the building?
- No.

775
00:48:25.195 --> 00:48:27.509
You didn't take it out of
the building and give it to anybody?

776
00:48:27.529 --> 00:48:28.863
- No.
- You didn't send it?

777
00:48:29.446 --> 00:48:31.362
- No.
- You didn't send it to anyone?

778
00:48:31.445 --> 00:48:32.645
No.

779
00:48:33.613 --> 00:48:35.260
Reality, can you guess how many people

780
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.995
might have printed out that article?

781
00:48:38.738 --> 00:48:40.737
- No.
- It's not many.

782
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:45.029
That article has made it
outside of NSA, okay?

783
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:46.959
Obviously, because we're here.

784
00:48:48.655 --> 00:48:51.738
And the most likely candidate,
by far and away

785
00:48:52.446 --> 00:48:53.646
is you.

786
00:48:54.864 --> 00:48:58.323
So... now, I... don't think...

787
00:48:59.364 --> 00:49:00.822
I don't think you're, you know

788
00:49:00.905 --> 00:49:03.738
a big bad master spy or anything, okay?

789
00:49:03.821 --> 00:49:05.323
I don't. I don't think that.

790
00:49:05.406 --> 00:49:06.803
I think that I've looked at the evidence

791
00:49:06.823 --> 00:49:08.906
and it's compelling.

792
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.014
Now, I'm not sure why you did it

793
00:49:12.447 --> 00:49:14.155
and I'm curious as to that

794
00:49:14.239 --> 00:49:16.698
but I think you might've been angry

795
00:49:16.782 --> 00:49:18.948
over everything
that's going on politics-wise.

796
00:49:20.156 --> 00:49:21.490
Because you can't turn on...

797
00:49:22.698 --> 00:49:25.127
You can't turn on the TV
without getting pissed off.

798
00:49:25.697 --> 00:49:26.897
Or at least I can't.

799
00:49:28.366 --> 00:49:30.319
I think you might've just made a mistake.

800
00:49:31.449 --> 00:49:33.512
Now, why I'm here
and why I wanna talk to you

801
00:49:33.532 --> 00:49:36.449
is to figure out
the why behind this, okay?

802
00:49:37.825 --> 00:49:39.741
So, I ask you again.

803
00:49:41.658 --> 00:49:43.182
Did you take it out and send it?

804
00:49:46.949 --> 00:49:48.149
I didn't.

805
00:49:49.033 --> 00:49:50.866
I put it in the burn bag.

806
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:53.199
I mean, I'm trying to deploy.

807
00:49:53.282 --> 00:49:55.222
I'm not trying to be
a whistleblower. That's crazy.

808
00:49:55.242 --> 00:49:58.242
So how would you think that
a document would end up getting out?

809
00:49:58.534 --> 00:49:59.734
I mean...

810
00:49:59.783 --> 00:50:00.983
I mean...

811
00:50:03.783 --> 00:50:05.069
Let's be honest, there's...

812
00:50:05.449 --> 00:50:08.201
there's little to no security
on documents.

813
00:50:08.282 --> 00:50:10.284
I... I mean, nobody pats you down.

814
00:50:10.366 --> 00:50:11.597
We talk about it all the time at work.

815
00:50:11.617 --> 00:50:14.138
Like, oh, you have to show our lunch.
Oh, "You eat so healthy."

816
00:50:14.158 --> 00:50:16.908
Like, every day, all the time,
and people just... this...

817
00:50:17.658 --> 00:50:20.783
I mean, we have a building
full of geniuses, right?

818
00:50:20.867 --> 00:50:22.908
And, I mean, I guess, I'm just...

819
00:50:23.534 --> 00:50:25.534
I'm talking and I'm nervous

820
00:50:25.617 --> 00:50:28.034
but I didn't...
I didn't do anything with it.

821
00:50:28.909 --> 00:50:30.764
I mean, I'm trying to go somewhere else.

822
00:50:30.784 --> 00:50:32.659
I'm trying to increase my clearance.

823
00:50:33.034 --> 00:50:34.993
I mean... and I know it was sensitive

824
00:50:35.077 --> 00:50:36.806
and I thought it would be cool
to have on my desk

825
00:50:36.826 --> 00:50:38.347
- for a couple of days.
- Okay. But do you remember...

826
00:50:38.367 --> 00:50:40.700
You said you remember
putting it in the burn bag?

827
00:50:40.783 --> 00:50:41.885
- Yeah.
- Just sliding it in there?

828
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:44.243
- Okay.
- I remember that. Folded it in half.

829
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:47.110
Folded in half?

830
00:50:50.701 --> 00:50:51.901
Yeah.

831
00:50:52.035 --> 00:50:53.235
Yeah.

832
00:50:53.661 --> 00:50:54.861
Because it didn't...

833
00:50:56.744 --> 00:50:57.994
Yeah, I folded it in half.

834
00:51:00.659 --> 00:51:02.661
What if I tell you that that document

835
00:51:03.453 --> 00:51:04.653
folded in half

836
00:51:05.537 --> 00:51:07.411
made its way outside of NSA?

837
00:51:09.785 --> 00:51:10.884
I don't... I don't know that.

838
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:13.958
It made its way out in an envelope,
post-marked Augusta, Georgia.

839
00:51:14.912 --> 00:51:17.494
See, things are starting
to get a little specific.

840
00:51:20.452 --> 00:51:21.493
- Yeah.
- It made its way

841
00:51:21.577 --> 00:51:23.768
to an online news source
that you subscribe to.

842
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:25.828
Getting really specific.

843
00:51:28.702 --> 00:51:30.036
So, I'm gonna ask you again.

844
00:51:35.371 --> 00:51:38.078
What is very, very...

845
00:51:39.495 --> 00:51:40.995
What's very compelling...

846
00:51:44.662 --> 00:51:46.746
I'd like to know the reason, because I...

847
00:51:47.746 --> 00:51:50.037
I don't think you make
a habit out of this.

848
00:51:50.954 --> 00:51:52.154
At all. At all.

849
00:51:53.496 --> 00:51:54.696
I think you just...

850
00:51:55.828 --> 00:51:57.028
messed up.

851
00:51:58.079 --> 00:51:59.392
Now, I'm not sure why you did it

852
00:51:59.412 --> 00:52:01.246
and I'd like to hear from you on that.

853
00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:04.704
But the what and the how

854
00:52:05.746 --> 00:52:08.329
would you agree, it looks awfully bad?

855
00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.319
It looks really bad, yeah.

856
00:52:13.622 --> 00:52:15.527
If you're angry about what's going on...

857
00:52:16.538 --> 00:52:17.824
if there's anything that...

858
00:52:20.872 --> 00:52:23.121
Look, you've had a good career.
You have.

859
00:52:24.414 --> 00:52:27.538
If there's something that just
pushed you over the edge on this

860
00:52:29.581 --> 00:52:30.790
now is the perfect time.

861
00:52:32.539 --> 00:52:33.739
This is a podium.

862
00:52:38.081 --> 00:52:39.281
You know...

863
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.240
like...

864
00:52:42.123 --> 00:52:43.323
like he said...

865
00:52:44.373 --> 00:52:46.331
I don't think we're coming in here to say

866
00:52:46.414 --> 00:52:49.665
you're some big bad mastermind,
prolific spy kind of thing.

867
00:52:50.082 --> 00:52:52.892
I think what we both think is that
maybe you made a mistake.

868
00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:55.686
Maybe you weren't thinking for a minute.

869
00:52:55.706 --> 00:52:57.326
Maybe you got angry, like he said.

870
00:52:58.916 --> 00:53:00.958
I mean, that's what I'm hoping.

871
00:53:02.082 --> 00:53:03.312
If that... that's the case

872
00:53:03.332 --> 00:53:04.895
then that makes us feel a little better

873
00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:08.249
knowing we don't have
a real serious problem here.

874
00:53:09.624 --> 00:53:12.166
You know, that's something
that concerns us, too

875
00:53:13.082 --> 00:53:15.958
that this isn't an ongoing problem.

876
00:53:16.791 --> 00:53:18.172
But we need to figure it out.

877
00:53:18.541 --> 00:53:20.416
And if it was a mistake

878
00:53:22.625 --> 00:53:23.825
let's deal with it.

879
00:53:25.208 --> 00:53:26.408
Is this...

880
00:53:27.291 --> 00:53:28.491
Is this a room?

881
00:53:30.375 --> 00:53:31.575
Is that a room?

882
00:53:44.417 --> 00:53:46.227
So how'd you get it out of the office?

883
00:54:04.626 --> 00:54:06.210
Folded in half in my pantyhose.

884
00:54:21.543 --> 00:54:22.743
Okay.

885
00:54:23.917 --> 00:54:25.251
And what did you do with it?

886
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:37.212
I put it in an envelope and sent it to...

887
00:54:37.753 --> 00:54:39.253
Anybody specifically there?

888
00:54:40.169 --> 00:54:42.074
I don't think I put a name.
I just put...

889
00:54:43.085 --> 00:54:45.107
Had you communicated with them
prior to you doing that once?

890
00:54:45.127 --> 00:54:47.316
No. I wasn't trying to be
a Snowden or anything.

891
00:54:47.336 --> 00:54:48.857
And that's what...
I don't think you were either.

892
00:54:48.877 --> 00:54:50.336
I really don't, but...

893
00:54:50.877 --> 00:54:52.335
I think you made a mistake.

894
00:54:53.002 --> 00:54:56.503
But I don't think either one of us

895
00:54:56.587 --> 00:54:58.587
think you're trying to be Snowden.

896
00:54:59.711 --> 00:55:02.628
No, it was just the one document

897
00:55:02.711 --> 00:55:04.569
- and like you said, because...
- Right.

898
00:55:04.878 --> 00:55:08.045
I've had a really hard time at work.

899
00:55:08.754 --> 00:55:10.837
I've filed formal complaints

900
00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:14.129
about them having <i>Fox News</i> on
all the time.

901
00:55:14.379 --> 00:55:17.045
And... and, like, for God's sake,
put Al Jazeera on

902
00:55:17.128 --> 00:55:19.128
or a slideshow of people's pets.

903
00:55:19.211 --> 00:55:20.860
Like, I've tried everything
to get that changed.

904
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.943
That would probably be a good thing.
Unfortunately, it doesn't matter

905
00:55:22.963 --> 00:55:25.344
which side you're watching,
they're all pretty bad.

906
00:55:26.046 --> 00:55:27.246
But...

907
00:55:45.713 --> 00:55:46.999
Where did you mail it from?

908
00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:59.505
A mailbox on Baston Road.

909
00:56:00.172 --> 00:56:01.372
Okay.

910
00:56:01.463 --> 00:56:04.381
It's the shopping center with the bank

911
00:56:04.465 --> 00:56:07.506
and the Earth Fare grocery store.

912
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:09.235
Okay. I know
where you're talking about.

913
00:56:09.255 --> 00:56:12.297
At the intersection of Baston Road
and Fury's Ferry.

914
00:56:12.381 --> 00:56:15.173
- Fury's Ferry. Okay.
- I never could say that right.

915
00:56:15.673 --> 00:56:16.923
Fury's Ferry.

916
00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:20.278
And it was just a mailbox sitting out
in the middle of the parking lot?

917
00:56:20.298 --> 00:56:21.498
Just a metal box.

918
00:56:24.049 --> 00:56:25.715
- Okay.
- Okay.

919
00:56:34.007 --> 00:56:35.531
Do you remember what day it was?

920
00:56:38.256 --> 00:56:39.840
What day of the week was the 9th?

921
00:56:40.799 --> 00:56:41.999
Let's see...

922
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:43.749
We'll check.

923
00:56:45.216 --> 00:56:46.488
Do you need some water or something?

924
00:56:46.508 --> 00:56:47.550
I'd like some water

925
00:56:47.633 --> 00:56:49.154
once we figure out
what day of the week it was.

926
00:56:49.174 --> 00:56:51.466
- Okay.
- Let's see, I wanna say it was...

927
00:56:52.008 --> 00:56:53.866
If I can figure out this crazy phone...

928
00:56:54.174 --> 00:56:56.300
- I wanna say it was a Tuesday.
- Tuesday.

929
00:56:57.883 --> 00:56:59.906
Is there something significant
about the 9th

930
00:56:59.926 --> 00:57:01.008
- in other ways?
- No.

931
00:57:01.092 --> 00:57:03.799
It was probably
just the first day I saw it.

932
00:57:04.465 --> 00:57:08.258
If... It might've been
the 11th or the 12th.

933
00:57:08.716 --> 00:57:12.383
If I subbed yoga on the night of the 11th

934
00:57:12.467 --> 00:57:14.258
then the yoga studio is right there.

935
00:57:14.342 --> 00:57:16.295
So it would've been a Thursday or Friday?

936
00:57:16.383 --> 00:57:17.966
- Thursday or Friday.
- Okay.

937
00:57:19.008 --> 00:57:20.208
What yoga studio?

938
00:57:21.592 --> 00:57:23.300
It's called, "Oh, Yeah Yoga".

939
00:57:24.009 --> 00:57:27.092
So, you said maybe
you mailed it Thursday or Friday?

940
00:57:28.718 --> 00:57:29.918
Okay.

941
00:57:30.134 --> 00:57:31.551
How did you know to...

942
00:57:33.468 --> 00:57:34.668
mail it to...

943
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:09.635
So you wanted to be able to publish it?

944
00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:12.170
Yeah.

945
00:58:12.636 --> 00:58:14.094
Did you send it anywhere else?

946
00:58:14.178 --> 00:58:15.426
- No.
- No?

947
00:58:16.427 --> 00:58:19.427
No other publications
you've shown it to or given it to?

948
00:58:19.511 --> 00:58:20.711
No.

949
00:58:21.678 --> 00:58:22.819
Is there gonna be anything here

950
00:58:22.844 --> 00:58:24.158
that we're gonna be surprised to find?

951
00:58:24.178 --> 00:58:26.115
No, I never took the document
out of my car.

952
00:58:26.135 --> 00:58:28.421
Is there anything on your phone
or your computer?

953
00:58:29.595 --> 00:58:33.053
On my phone, you might...
I don't know if I deleted it

954
00:58:33.137 --> 00:58:36.137
but you guys are probably gonna
be able to see it anyway, but...

955
00:58:36.219 --> 00:58:38.172
there will be a screenshot
of the address.

956
00:58:42.262 --> 00:58:43.887
- Okay.
- Okay.

957
00:58:45.845 --> 00:58:47.465
You mentioned you want some water?

958
00:58:48.345 --> 00:58:49.545
Yeah.

959
00:58:50.679 --> 00:58:52.679
- Yeah, why don't we...
- No, I'll make it.

960
00:58:53.095 --> 00:58:55.471
I'm just gonna get somebody out here.

961
00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:00.883
Hey, can I have somebody in here, please?

962
00:59:01.303 --> 00:59:02.845
Do you want a bottle of water?

963
00:59:07.222 --> 00:59:09.867
Do you have a filter in the fridge,
or do you just want tap water?

964
00:59:09.887 --> 00:59:14.720
Tap water. There's a mason jar
or glass next to the sink.

965
00:59:16.306 --> 00:59:17.951
Can I get one person
to just stand here, please

966
00:59:17.971 --> 00:59:19.257
so I can go to the kitchen?

967
00:59:47.097 --> 00:59:48.297
Do you guys...

968
00:59:48.848 --> 00:59:50.658
You're not gonna fit in there anymore.

969
00:59:52.472 --> 00:59:54.234
She's not gonna fit in there anymore.

970
01:00:00.723 --> 01:00:02.057
She still under the bed?

971
01:00:03.014 --> 01:00:04.214
The cat?

972
01:00:04.473 --> 01:00:05.950
Is the cat still under the bed?

973
01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.090
She's a big girl.

974
01:00:17.265 --> 01:00:19.849
- Oh, yeah. We're trying.
- How old is she?

975
01:00:24.267 --> 01:00:25.932
She's three years now.

976
01:00:31.932 --> 01:00:34.141
- But girl likes to eat.
- Oh, yeah.

977
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:36.349
She likes carbs.

978
01:00:36.642 --> 01:00:38.432
She's got a little slim fit on her.

979
01:00:40.016 --> 01:00:41.540
When she came out, I was like...

980
01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:48.475
Yeah, she will snatch bread
right out of my mouth, like...

981
01:00:49.434 --> 01:00:51.391
"Girl, you do not need those."

982
01:01:15.518 --> 01:01:16.718
Water.

983
01:01:23.059 --> 01:01:24.259
Thanks.

984
01:01:30.227 --> 01:01:32.560
So other than the screenshot on the phone

985
01:01:32.643 --> 01:01:34.215
there shouldn't be anything else?

986
01:01:34.311 --> 01:01:35.999
And there should be
nothing on the laptop?

987
01:01:36.019 --> 01:01:37.219
Nothing on the laptop.

988
01:01:40.977 --> 01:01:42.394
I do have a TOR browser.

989
01:01:47.645 --> 01:01:51.477
Which probably looks bad, but...

990
01:01:52.978 --> 01:01:54.178
Okay.

991
01:01:55.561 --> 01:01:58.061
What do you use a TOR browser for?

992
01:02:26.853 --> 01:02:28.901
Have you had any contact
with anyone from...

993
01:02:38.814 --> 01:02:40.014
The Intercept?

994
01:02:41.688 --> 01:02:43.022
Have you tried to reach out?

995
01:02:43.605 --> 01:02:46.271
Like you said, I saw the article

996
01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:48.682
and I couldn't believe it wasn't a thing.

997
01:02:49.521 --> 01:02:50.721
It made you mad.

998
01:02:52.439 --> 01:02:53.771
It made me very mad.

999
01:02:56.730 --> 01:03:00.314

that week...

1045
01:05:26.985 --> 01:05:29.652
It was just too much to sit back
and watch it and think..

1046
01:05:30.737 --> 01:05:33.820
"Why do I have this job
if I'm going to be helpless?"

1047
01:05:35.486 --> 01:05:36.686
It was just...

1048
01:05:38.777 --> 01:05:39.977
Sorry.

1049
01:05:42.279 --> 01:05:43.613
It was just the final straw.

1050
01:05:45.695 --> 01:05:47.528
Was there something that just...

1051
01:05:49.027 --> 01:05:50.319
just did it?

1052
01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.280
Because you don't seem
the type to do this.

1053
01:05:54.988 --> 01:05:56.188
I'm not.

1054
01:05:57.113 --> 01:05:58.313
I'm not.

1055
01:06:00.361 --> 01:06:02.738
I wanna go out with our Special Forces.

1056
01:06:03.821 --> 01:06:06.446
I mean, that's why
I got out of the Air Force. I...

1057
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:09.125
That's why...
that's why I'm here in Augusta.

1058
01:06:09.195 --> 01:06:12.321
I was trying to get my clearance back
so I could get deployments.

1059
01:06:12.405 --> 01:06:15.263
It just was at a time I wasn't
applying for deployments. I...

1060
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:19.947
I had seven, eight months
left of a job that

1061
01:06:20.031 --> 01:06:22.155
didn't mean anything to me,
because it's Iran

1062
01:06:22.238 --> 01:06:23.320
and I'm a Pashto linguist.

1063
01:06:23.362 --> 01:06:25.446
Like, what am I doing translating Farsi?

1064
01:06:25.864 --> 01:06:27.064
I just...

1065
01:06:29.113 --> 01:06:30.198
I felt hopeless.

1066
01:06:30.281 --> 01:06:34.197
And just seeing that information
be contested back and forth...

1067
01:06:34.406 --> 01:06:36.406
back and forth in the public domain

1068
01:06:36.489 --> 01:06:38.552
with everything else that just
keeps getting released

1069
01:06:38.572 --> 01:06:40.715
and everything that
keeps getting leaked, like

1070
01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:42.906
why can't this get out there?

1071
01:06:42.989 --> 01:06:44.447
Why can't this be public?

1072
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:52.657
Were you surprised to see us today?

1073
01:06:57.490 --> 01:06:59.073
Yeah. Actually, I thought

1074
01:06:59.948 --> 01:07:03.425
you were here to ask about the house,
because it's still for lease online.

1075
01:07:03.656 --> 01:07:06.085
Because you didn't seem surprised
when we pulled up.

1076
01:07:06.615 --> 01:07:09.699
Oh, God, that's just 'cause
I have a resting bitch face.

1077
01:07:10.824 --> 01:07:12.823
And you guys turned around, and...

1078
01:07:14.156 --> 01:07:17.115
then, "FBI!" I was like,
"What is going on," you know?

1079
01:07:18.158 --> 01:07:20.949
And then you showed
your badge right up, and...

1080
01:07:24.616 --> 01:07:27.449
I submitted my security packet yesterday

1081
01:07:27.533 --> 01:07:29.617
for my clearance on E-QIP.
So I thought...

1082
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:32.366
that was what's it for.

1083
01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:35.429
I was like, "Why are you guys
questioning me for my own clearance?"

1084
01:07:35.449 --> 01:07:36.649
- But...
- Okay.

1085
01:07:38.909 --> 01:07:40.284
That's not gonna happen.

1086
01:07:43.283 --> 01:07:44.760
Anything else you can think of?

1087
01:07:45.824 --> 01:07:47.804
What we have to do is
we have to do the search.

1088
01:07:47.824 --> 01:07:49.024
Of course.

1089
01:07:49.243 --> 01:07:50.443
You said...

1090
01:07:53.909 --> 01:07:55.575
Sorry. I have a sinus infection

1091
01:07:55.658 --> 01:07:56.944
- so I sound...
- It's okay.

1092
01:07:57.784 --> 01:07:58.984
I sound awful.

1093
01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:01.838
Well, this is the best room
to be in it with.

1094
01:08:02.742 --> 01:08:04.504
Do you remember the site from memory?

1095
01:08:06.034 --> 01:08:09.450
If you scroll down to the bottom,
there's "Contact"

1096
01:08:09.534 --> 01:08:12.409
but it's not as obvious as you think
because it's closer.

1097
01:08:13.783 --> 01:08:15.498
How long did it take you to find it?

1098
01:08:18.159 --> 01:08:21.285
About probably
three minutes of scrolling, which...

1099
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.065
felt like an eternity sitting in my car.

1100
01:08:25.952 --> 01:08:27.152
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1101
01:08:29.118 --> 01:08:31.071
You said the document stayed in your car.

1102
01:08:33.452 --> 01:08:36.035
- Yeah.
- Where did you get the envelope?

1103
01:08:38.452 --> 01:08:40.535
The box of envelopes is...

1104
01:08:42.534 --> 01:08:44.160
It's on the back seat in the car

1105
01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:46.702
behind the driver's seat. I...

1106
01:08:47.953 --> 01:08:51.119
I had a bunch of forms
I had to mail out last December.

1107
01:08:51.202 --> 01:08:53.012
So it's been in my car since December.

1108
01:08:53.494 --> 01:08:54.694
Okay.

1109
01:08:55.079 --> 01:08:56.279
And the stamps?

1110
01:08:56.953 --> 01:08:58.153
Stamps.

1111
01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:02.160
I think I have about
one or two left in there

1112
01:09:02.244 --> 01:09:04.454
but I keep stamps in the glove box

1113
01:09:04.538 --> 01:09:08.078
in case I have to mail anything out,
like bills and stuff.

1114
01:09:08.411 --> 01:09:10.119
Okay. In your glove box?

1115
01:09:10.745 --> 01:09:11.945
In the glove box, yeah.

1116
01:09:12.786 --> 01:09:13.986
All right.

1117
01:09:14.204 --> 01:09:15.934
I'm trying to think
if I have anything else.

1118
01:09:15.954 --> 01:09:18.412
The search,
the guys will continue the search.

1119
01:09:19.245 --> 01:09:21.150
They'll search the vehicle and the house

1120
01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:23.163
and they'll photograph everything.

1121
01:09:24.703 --> 01:09:26.496
You... The search team leader

1122
01:09:26.788 --> 01:09:28.836
is gonna sit down with you
and go through...

1123
01:09:40.704 --> 01:09:42.580
Do you have any questions for me?

1124
01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:45.446
So many.

1125
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.079
This sounds really bad.

1126
01:09:52.414 --> 01:09:53.831
Am I going to jail tonight?

1127
01:09:57.037 --> 01:09:58.752
I don't know how to answer that yet.

1128
01:09:59.288 --> 01:10:00.913
- Okay.
- What was the question?

1129
01:10:00.997 --> 01:10:02.914
If she's going to jail tonight.

1130
01:10:03.372 --> 01:10:05.563
Said I don't have
the answer to that quite yet.

1131
01:10:07.538 --> 01:10:09.538
Of course, the search is still going on.

1132
01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:11.780
In the case that...

1133
01:10:13.123 --> 01:10:14.372
I don't have memorized...

1134
01:10:15.205 --> 01:10:16.955
The woman, her name is Cathy

1135
01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:20.164
she works at the Augusta Humane Society.

1136
01:10:20.247 --> 01:10:21.854
- Okay.
- She can come and pick up the dog

1137
01:10:21.874 --> 01:10:24.040
in the case that I'm not here tonight.

1138
01:10:24.123 --> 01:10:25.414
Well, let's don't...

1139
01:10:25.998 --> 01:10:27.414
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1140
01:10:28.164 --> 01:10:30.593
Let's don't put the cart
before the horse right now.

1141
01:10:31.166 --> 01:10:32.366
Okay.

1142
01:10:32.831 --> 01:10:34.031
Okay?

1143
01:10:34.957 --> 01:10:36.157
I just...

1144
01:10:36.414 --> 01:10:37.935
- My only concern is getting her
- I understand.

1145
01:10:37.955 --> 01:10:40.353
And then maybe one more phone call
to get the cat covered.

1146
01:10:40.373 --> 01:10:41.708
We'll figure that out.

1147
01:10:41.791 --> 01:10:43.749
If it comes to that...

1148
01:10:44.457 --> 01:10:46.374
well, we'll figure that out.

1149
01:10:46.456 --> 01:10:48.603
And I don't have the answer
to that yet. And I'm going to...

1150
01:10:48.623 --> 01:10:51.104
We'll... we'll cross that bridge
when we get to it, okay?

1151
01:10:51.124 --> 01:10:52.324
Okay.

1152
01:10:53.707 --> 01:10:54.907
What else?

1153
01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:47.034
You turn it off?

1154
01:11:47.583 --> 01:11:48.783
It's still recording.

1155
01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.014
Would you like to sit down somewhere?

1156
01:12:21.419 --> 01:12:22.961
- I'm fine.
- You're fine?

1157
01:12:23.752 --> 01:12:24.952
Yeah.

1158
01:12:47.128 --> 01:12:48.328
Reality.

1159
01:13:48.381 --> 01:13:50.714
<i>Hello. This is a prepaid collect call</i>

1160
01:13:50.797 --> 01:13:54.173
<i>from an inmate at Lincoln County Jail
in Lincolnton, Georgia.</i>

1161
01:13:54.257 --> 01:13:56.839
<i>This call is subject to recording
and monitoring.</i>

1162
01:13:56.923 --> 01:13:59.172
<i>To accept charges, press 1.</i>

1163
01:13:59.256 --> 01:14:00.861
<i>As soon as Mom and Gary get to Georgia</i>

1164
01:14:00.881 --> 01:14:02.596
<i>they're gonna pick up Mina at least.</i>

1165
01:14:03.298 --> 01:14:04.904
<i>And Mickey will stay back
with the shelter</i>

1166
01:14:04.924 --> 01:14:06.673
<i>but they're safe in the house.</i>

1167
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:09.445
<i>Everyone was really worried about them</i>

1168
01:14:09.465 --> 01:14:10.799
<i>when they searched my house.</i>

1169
01:14:11.755 --> 01:14:13.007
<i>Bunch of dog people.</i>

1170
01:14:14.466 --> 01:14:16.196
<i>Yeah, I mean,
that was the one thing, like</i>

1171
01:14:16.216 --> 01:14:17.788
<i>when the FBI was interrogating me</i>

1172
01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.745
<i>they were just like, "Look,
we have everything. We're just..."</i>

1173
01:14:21.674 --> 01:14:22.874
<i>We just wanna know why."</i>

1174
01:14:23.882 --> 01:14:25.082
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

1175
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:28.195
<i>They didn't care about anything else</i>

1176
01:14:28.215 --> 01:14:30.195
<i>they were just straight-up
curious to know why.</i>

1177
01:14:30.215 --> 01:14:31.415
<i>They say Reality Winner</i>

1178
01:14:31.465 --> 01:14:32.507
<i>has two faces.</i>

1179
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:34.091
<i>One, an Air Force veteran</i>

1180
01:14:34.174 --> 01:14:35.216
<i>a loving daughter</i>

1181
01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.342
<i>and a yoga instructor.</i>

1182
01:14:36.425 --> 01:14:37.466
<i>The other, a person</i>

1183
01:14:37.549 --> 01:14:38.821
<i>who had taken a keen interest</i>

1184
01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:39.882
<i>in the Middle East</i>

1185
01:14:39.966 --> 01:14:41.008
<i>with suspicious motives.</i>

1186
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:42.425
<i>When asked by the FBI</i>

1187
01:14:43.258 --> 01:14:46.174
<i>Winner stated that
she knew the intelligence report</i>

1188
01:14:46.257 --> 01:14:49.592
<i>revealed sources and methods</i>

1189
01:14:50.341 --> 01:14:52.925
<i>used by the US intelligence agencies</i>

1190
01:14:53.425 --> 01:14:56.882
<i>and she knew that compromising
those sources and methods</i>

1191
01:14:57.175 --> 01:14:59.425
<i>could be valuable to our adversaries</i>

1192
01:14:59.508 --> 01:15:01.259
<i>and damage the United States.</i>

1193
01:15:02.009 --> 01:15:04.509
<i>She claimed to hate America.</i>

1194
01:15:05.674 --> 01:15:09.217
<i>When asked, "You don't really
hate America, right?"</i>

1195
01:15:10.259 --> 01:15:11.459
<i>She responded</i>

1196
01:15:11.967 --> 01:15:13.342
<i>"I mean, yeah, I do.</i>

1197
01:15:13.425 --> 01:15:17.175
<i>It's literally the worst thing
to happen on the planet."</i>

1198
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:20.509
<i>She was a quintessential example</i>

1199
01:15:21.178 --> 01:15:22.676
<i>of an insider threat.</i>

1200
01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:25.884
<i>She's obviously
an intemperate political activist.</i>

1201
01:15:25.968 --> 01:15:28.009
<i>How did she get a security clearance?</i>

1202
01:15:28.092 --> 01:15:29.531
<i>Well, you could ask the same question</i>

1203
01:15:29.551 --> 01:15:32.075
<i>about a lot of people
working in government right now.</i>

1204
01:15:33.177 --> 01:15:36.426
<i>I keep telling myself to act more
like I think I did something wrong.</i>

1205
01:15:37.718 --> 01:15:39.677
<i>We are more concerned with the leaks</i>

1206
01:15:39.885 --> 01:15:43.844
<i>than we are with the fact that
the Russians attacked our democracy</i>

1207
01:15:43.927 --> 01:15:46.656
<i>and that the president's campaign
may have participated in it.</i>

1208
01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:49.010
<i>- They didn't attack our democracy.
- They did.</i>

1209
01:15:49.761 --> 01:15:52.190
<i>If you look at this,</i>
<i>it's sort of like</i> The Intercept

1210
01:15:52.885 --> 01:15:54.553
<i>knowingly or unknowingly</i>

1211
01:15:54.636 --> 01:15:56.802
<i>outed their own source.</i>

1212
01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:58.177
<i>I mean, it made no sense.</i>

1213
01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.866
<i>Like, is it that...
Are you that inept?</i>

1214
01:15:59.886 --> 01:16:02.970
<i>- Sloppy, irresponsible, what is it?
- Both.</i>

1215
01:16:03.345 --> 01:16:04.825
{\an5}<i>As a journalist, we count on people</i>

1216
01:16:04.845 --> 01:16:05.886
{\an5}<i>to leak us information</i>

1217
01:16:05.969 --> 01:16:08.552
<i>that's vital for our democracy
to function.</i>

1218
01:16:08.845 --> 01:16:10.845
<i>Knowing what happened
with the Russian hack</i>

1219
01:16:10.886 --> 01:16:12.595
<i>was a very important thing.</i>

1220
01:16:12.679 --> 01:16:16.095
<i>Now, she did violate
the rules of her employment</i>

1221
01:16:16.178 --> 01:16:18.052
<i>but this penalty that she's gotten</i>

1222
01:16:18.136 --> 01:16:20.345
<i>five years, is exceedingly long</i>

1223
01:16:20.429 --> 01:16:21.844
<i>one of the longest penalties.</i>

1224
01:16:21.928 --> 01:16:24.846
<i>And it's obviously there to create a...</i>

1225
01:16:25.261 --> 01:16:27.011
<i>you know, a chilling effect, right?</i>

1226
01:16:27.095 --> 01:16:29.013
<i>So that other people don't do this</i>

1227
01:16:29.095 --> 01:16:30.596
<i>and we stay in the dark.</i>

1228
01:16:30.679 --> 01:16:32.679
<i>You have one minute remaining
on your call.</i>

1229
01:16:33.012 --> 01:16:34.096
<i>You have one minute left.</i>

1230
01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:36.429
<i>If you could just
get that message to Lane.</i>

1231
01:16:36.512 --> 01:16:37.712
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

1232
01:16:38.138 --> 01:16:40.304
<i>All right.
I really appreciate it, Brittany.</i>

1233
01:16:40.388 --> 01:16:41.430
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

1234
01:16:41.513 --> 01:16:43.942
<i>- I'm just sorry that...
- Oh, one more name, Don Z.</i>

1235
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:45.887
<i>- Last name starts with a Z.
- Okay.</i>

1236
01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:48.805
<i>Tell him I'm probably
not gonna talk to him again</i>

1237
01:16:48.887 --> 01:16:50.087
<i>but that I'm...</i>

1238
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:53.692
<i>I'm doing push-ups like crazy,
and that I'm gonna miss him.</i>

1239
01:16:54.013 --> 01:16:55.096
<i>Just let him know that.</i>

1240
01:16:55.179 --> 01:16:56.721
<i>Obviously been recording.</i>

1241
01:16:58.097 --> 01:16:59.297
<i>I'm going to...</i>

1242
01:17:00.763 --> 01:17:02.701
<i>- What's up?
- Going to end the recording.</i>

1243
01:17:02.721 --> 01:17:04.846
<i>- And stop the interview.
- I think so.</i>

1244
01:17:05.055 --> 01:17:10.556
<i>So this is at five...
let's call it 5.17pm</i>

1245
01:17:11.347 --> 01:17:14.305
<i>ceasing recording on June third.</i>
