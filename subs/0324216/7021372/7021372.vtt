00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:56.963
The film which you are about to see...

2
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.804
...Is an account of the tragedy
which befell a group of five youths.

3
00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:05.931
It is all the more tragic
in that they were young.

4
00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:10.443
But had they lived very, very long lives,
they could not have expected...

5
00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:14.276
...nor would they have wished to see
as much of the mad and macabre...

6
00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:16.565
...as they were to see that day.

7
00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.828
For them, an idyllic summer afternoon
became a nightmare.

8
00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:25.158
For 30 years, the files collected dust...

9
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:29.249
...in the Cold Cases division
of the Travis County Police Department.

10
00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:37.011
Over 1300 pieces of evidence
were collected from the crime scene...

11
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.012
...al the Hewitt residence.

12
00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:49.857
Yet none of the evidence
was more compelling...

13
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:54.820
...than the classified police footage
of the crime-scene walkthrough.

14
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.322
Test, test, test.

15
00:01:57.492 --> 00:02:01.030
Okay, this is August 20th, 1973.

16
00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.912
The time is 3:47 p.m.

17
00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:08.201
Location is the Hewitt residence
on Route 17.

18
00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.915
It's where victim one was found.

19
00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:12.375
Gonna do a walkthrough.

20
00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.964
And we're now descending the stairs
into the furnace room.

21
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.423
Uh...

22
00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:22.261
There's-- Over here.
There's scratch marks along the wall.

23
00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:24.425
There's some more over here.

24
00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:25.718
Right along here and--

25
00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:28.354
Oh, there's something over here
it seems.

26
00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:31.436
Looks like a clot of hair...

27
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.069
...and an embedded fingernail.

28
00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:39.107
All right, we're gonna go move
into the actual furnace room.

29
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.618
The events of that day were to lead
to one of the most bizarre crimes...

30
00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:45.075
...In the annals of American history:

31
00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:47.080
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

32
00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:53.837
Go. Hold on, hold on.
Don't let go. Not yet, not yet, not yet.

33
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.418
Yeah, now, now. Let go.

34
00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.251
Turn it up.

35
00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:05.383
Whoo!

36
00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.692
Somebody please make her stop singing.

37
00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.538
- I think you got a beautiful voice, baby.
-Thank you.

38
00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:41.461
Can you believe
we didn't even know each other yesterday?

39
00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:47.182
I know. It's just amazing.

40
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.766
You know what's even more amazing?

41
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.975
Hello?

42
00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:56.901
Hello? Can we get a pause or halftime?

43
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.687
Okay, the fact that 33,000 Americans
each day...

44
00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:02.357
...are infected
with a sexually transmitted disease...

45
00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.492
...and two thirds of them
are just about your age.

46
00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:14.668
Hey, Morgan. How are you the expert
on the dumbest shit?

47
00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.510
What are the odds
of you guys passing through El Paso...

48
00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.391
...just as I started to hitch?

49
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:32.144
I mean, it's like synchronicity.

50
00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:37.688
It's like LSD.
It's like this shit does not just happen.

51
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.612
Oh, baby, they gotta play "Freebird."

52
00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:48.118
They have to.
We paid a fortune for these tickets.

53
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.155
Yo, Kemp, can you do something
about the AC back here? I'm melting.

54
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:53.702
No.

55
00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:58.371
But if you or Pepper get too hot,
you could always take your clothes off.

56
00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:03.209
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- You are such a perv.

57
00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.676
-Don't listen to him, Pepper.
-Why not? I think he's funny.

58
00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.051
She's only known you for 19 hours.

59
00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.893
I've lived with him for three years,
and trust me, he is not funny.

60
00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:29.160
- Morgan, hey, let me see that.
- Hey.

61
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:30.819
-Careful, man.
-Thank you.

62
00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:34.160
I think I can manage, college boy. Erin.

63
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.701
Oh, no, thank you. I'm nauseous.

64
00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.243
Montezuma's revenge.

65
00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:41.254
-I was, like, "Erin, don't drink the water."
-I didn't.

66
00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:44.257
And she didn't drink the tequila,
she didn't drink the weed--

67
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.259
Smoke the weed.

68
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:51.845
Well, maybe I didn't go to Mexico
to watch you get shitfaced for four days.

69
00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.305
That is what people do
when they go to Mexico.

70
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.641
-What did you expect?
-I don't know.

71
00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.432
A tear-cut diamond ring...

72
00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:02.943
...that goes right here
on my beautiful little finger?

73
00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:06.940
-We are gonna get you a ring someday.
-I heard that one before.

74
00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.108
Peace offering.

75
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.368
Oops. Oh.

76
00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.537
- That was so not so cool.
- Hey, guys, take it down.

77
00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:24.715
Guys, relax, it's not like
we don't have 2 pounds of--

78
00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:27.297
Oh, great.

79
00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.470
-What did you say?
-I don't remember.

80
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.257
Look, I'm sorry. I got bad brain cells.

81
00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.893
Two pounds of pot.
Does that refresh your memory?

82
00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.770
Don't listen to him.
He's baked and he's stupid.

83
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.649
Baby, will you please tell me
that we did not go to Mexico to buy pot?

84
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.152
We did not go to Mexico to buy pot.

85
00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.314
Hey, come on, baby.

86
00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:53.326
Look at me.
I am not a dope smuggler, okay?

87
00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.662
-Tell me how much you love me.
-That much.

88
00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.994
-How much? That much?
-That much. This much.

89
00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.658
That's it. That's it.

90
00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.668
-Give me a kiss.
-That much.

91
00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:07.257
- Can you drive responsibly?
- I gotta drive.

92
00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:09.509
-Look out.
-Shit.

93
00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.716
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, fuck.

94
00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.306
You almost hit her.

95
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:22.564
What the fuck was she doing
walking in the middle of the road?

96
00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.027
Asshole.

97
00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.363
Hello?

98
00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.618
Hey, are you okay?

99
00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:39.373
Boys, that's a bad acid trip
walking right there.

100
00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.160
Hello? Can you hear us?

101
00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:44.044
You're gonna get killed doing that.

102
00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:46.542
Kemp, stop the van.

103
00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.673
Fuck that, we got a concert to go to.

104
00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:52.302
We're still three fucking hours
from Dallas. Where are you going?

105
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.133
We'll get there.

106
00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.263
- I've gotta get away.
- Hey.

107
00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.978
I just need to get away.

108
00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.183
What?

109
00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.395
-Gotta get away.
-From who?

110
00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.310
I wanna go home.

111
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.071
Okay, we can't leave her
out here like this.

112
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.278
Hey, let us help you, okay?

113
00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.033
Come on.

114
00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:18.662
- Come on. It's okay.
- It's okay.

115
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:23.329
It's okay, man, we'll give you a ride
wherever you wanna go.

116
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.244
I wanna go home.

117
00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.254
Okay, we can take you home.

118
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.142
Um, what's your name?

119
00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:50.936
They're all dead.

120
00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:57.280
Oh, my God.
I am way too stoned for this.

121
00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.780
Baby, let's find a hospital, okay?

122
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:06.043
You know what? Give me the vaguest idea
where there is one, we'll go there.

123
00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.044
Um, who's dead?

124
00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:15.549
Kemper, didn't your mother ever tell you
not to pick up hitchhikers?

125
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.892
No.

126
00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:26.305
You're going the wrong way.

127
00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:29.141
Stop. You're going the wrong way.

128
00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.606
- Hey.
- You're going the wrong way.

129
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.066
Sit down.

130
00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.989
- Jesus Christ.
- I can't go back there.

131
00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:42.162
You can't make me go back there.

132
00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.827
I won't go back there.

133
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.617
Back where?

134
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.338
She's all fucked up.

135
00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:53.965
No.

136
00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:56.718
He's a bad man.

137
00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.754
He's a really bad man.

138
00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:07.975
He's a bad man.

139
00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.399
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, God.

140
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.647
You're all gonna die.

141
00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.156
Grab it. Grab it.

142
00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.540
Oh, my God!

143
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.826
Oh, my God!

144
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:33.375
Let me out!

145
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.712
Oh, my God!

146
00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:42.217
Oh, my God.

147
00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.903
-You all right?
-That's too much. I'm okay, I'm okay.

148
00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:05.162
-Oh, my God!
-Take it easy. Let me see it.

149
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.242
-It's all over.
-There's nothing there.

150
00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:10.034
-It's gone. Look.
-I could have fucking died out there.

151
00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.202
We all could have, Morgan.

152
00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.126
That didn't just happen.

153
00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.927
I've never seen anybody die before.

154
00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.714
Yeah, most people never do.

155
00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:26.591
I don't see
how that's helping us right now.

156
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.352
I don't know why we had to pick her up.

157
00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.730
Why the fuck did we have to stop?

158
00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:36.936
-She needed help.
-Yeah, a lot of fucking help we did her.

159
00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:38.945
Leave her alone.

160
00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.065
Fuck.

161
00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.823
I just don't understand.

162
00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:50.199
Why did she do it?
And why did she have to pick us?

163
00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.619
Why did she have to pick us?

164
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.051
What are we gonna do?

165
00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:08.721
I don't know. We're gonna...

166
00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:12.888
We're gonna have to call the cops,
I guess.

167
00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:16.400
Yeah, on the list of bad ideas,
that one goes way up there.

168
00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:17.775
Are you kidding me?

169
00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:21.280
Officers, as you inspect the crime scene,
which is now our van...

170
00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:25.113
...please ignore the pinata filled
with marijuana you happen to come across.

171
00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:29.905
It played no part whatsoever in the demise
of this unfortunate young woman.

172
00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:33.997
Listen, keep your goddamn voice down.

173
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.956
Easy, easy, easy.

174
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.337
Goddamn it.

175
00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:47.013
You're not gonna listen to him.

176
00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.220
What the fuck are you doing?

177
00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:57.524
It's over.

178
00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:00.936
Kemper,
you just can't throw the shit out.

179
00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:09.077
You okay?

180
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:13.831
Baby, I'm sorry, okay?

181
00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.622
I did it for us.

182
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:19.879
I did it so we could start a life,
you know.

183
00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:22.131
I'm sorry.

184
00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.384
Okay?

185
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:36.729
I'll tell you this, there's no possible way
I'm ever getting back in that van.

186
00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:52.074
I guess that's what brains look like, huh?

187
00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.166
Sort of like...

188
00:13:57.587 --> 00:14:00.579
...lasagna, kind of.

189
00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:04.583
All right, I'll shut up now.

190
00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:14.346
I'll tell you this much...

191
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.683
...the next hitchhiker is shit out of luck,
I swear to God.

192
00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.190
Dude, gas station.

193
00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.091
Come on, Erin, let's find a bathroom.

194
00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:07.319
Well, I'll be damned.

195
00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:12.485
Ma'am, we need to report a suicide.

196
00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.328
Something like this comes along...

197
00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:20.117
...makes folks realize
how crazy the world is out there.

198
00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:21.784
Right.

199
00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:23.670
Would you mind calling the sheriff?

200
00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:26.414
It's gonna cost you 10 cents.

201
00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:35.803
You want some pig?

202
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.018
Shit.

203
00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.948
Big brothers.

204
00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:57.199
I just feel so disgusting.

205
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:04.958
Well, there's about six of them altogether
counting the dead one.

206
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:08.669
Poor thing. It's awful.

207
00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.214
Well, why don't you ask them yourself?

208
00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:14.095
Right.

209
00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:16.176
Where'd you say you found her again?

210
00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:20.677
Ma'am, I already told you.
About 10 minutes west of here.

211
00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:24.060
About five miles west.

212
00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:30.229
Ma'am, excuse me,
when is the sheriff gonna be here?

213
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.823
Sheriff said
he's headed over to the old Crawford Mill.

214
00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:35.988
I'm sorry, the what?

215
00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:37.743
The old Crawford Mill.

216
00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:41.873
He wants to know if you wouldn't mind
driving over there to make your report.

217
00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:44.660
Yes. Yes, we goddamn mind.

218
00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:51.379
I'm sorry, but how often do girls just
blow their heads off in this shit-hole town?

219
00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.088
Just calm down, okay? Let me--

220
00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:56.425
I'm sorry, I apologize.
But, ma'am, I don't understand.

221
00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:59.057
Why the hell won't the sheriff
just come out here?

222
00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:00.683
Didn't say.

223
00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.971
He said it'd be about two hours
before he could get here.

224
00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:08.392
We're not gonna drive around this town
with a dead girl in the back of our van.

225
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.567
Young man...

226
00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:17.071
...what you do is your own business.

227
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:33.875
Come on.

228
00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.886
Get in.

229
00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:42.350
I just wanna go home, okay?

230
00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:44.477
That's fine.

231
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.807
She's starting to stink back here.

232
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.097
No worse than the inside
of that fucking store.

233
00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.312
Did you smell that nasty beef shit?

234
00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:36.020
Oh, my God.

235
00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:42.819
Guys.

236
00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:09.474
Hello?

237
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:13.850
Hello?

238
00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:25.741
Ain't no sheriff here.

239
00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:30.409
I think we should drop off the body
and get the hell out of here.

240
00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:36.419
-Maybe we should vote on it.
-Kemper, no.

241
00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:41.011
Why not, Erin? It is a democracy.

242
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.968
How would you like it
if we just dumped your body out here?

243
00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:46.929
I'm sorry, nobody asked her
to blow her head off in our van.

244
00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:48.764
My van.

245
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.021
I say we dump her.

246
00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:58.440
Pig.

247
00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:02.440
Cool. All right, fine. Two votes.

248
00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:04.529
Now we just need one more.

249
00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.240
Kemper?

250
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:08.871
One more and we're out of here.

251
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:11.078
Kemper, please.

252
00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:20.375
Baby, she's dead.

253
00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:23.465
I just...

254
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.802
I really don't think it matters
where we leave her.

255
00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.638
Well, it matters to me,
if that means anything.

256
00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:30.847
Erin, look, I-

257
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:33.433
That girl has got parents
who's gonna want her back.

258
00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:37.771
Not just dumped on the side of the road
like a piece of trash.

259
00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:47.069
You see our Lone Ranger anywhere?

260
00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.871
Maybe this isn't the Crawford Mill.

261
00:20:57.506 --> 00:20:58.621
It's unbelievable.

262
00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:03.005
This is a joke. There's nobody here.

263
00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:05.386
There's no sheriff here.

264
00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:09.344
What?

265
00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:11.850
-I just saw something move.
-I just saw something.

266
00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:14.058
I swear to God
I saw something move in there.

267
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:16.814
-You're trying to scare me into leaving.
-Erin, come on.

268
00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:18.315
Go to hell.

269
00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:20.477
Erin, come on, quit screwing around.

270
00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:50.889
- Kemper!
- Erin.

271
00:21:51.894 --> 00:21:53.510
Erin.

272
00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:55.894
Erin, where are you?

273
00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:02.234
What's up, you?

274
00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:06.610
All right, you guys.

275
00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:09.241
- All right.
- Go.

276
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:16.908
- I got it.
-Okay.

277
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:30.547
Damn it. Give me--

278
00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:34.429
- Give me something to hold this shit.
- It's a possum.

279
00:22:34.603 --> 00:22:36.594
- Oh, dude, it's a possum.
- Indigenous to the--

280
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.101
You think this is a--?

281
00:22:40.568 --> 00:22:42.434
I didn't do that.

282
00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:51.404
All right, that's it.

283
00:22:51.579 --> 00:22:54.446
If somebody's out there,
just stop fucking around, all right?

284
00:22:54.874 --> 00:22:56.740
I mean it. Just come on out.

285
00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:10.674
Who are you?

286
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.767
What'd you do to her?

287
00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:19.303
Huh?

288
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:23.308
The girl out there in the van.

289
00:23:24.278 --> 00:23:26.189
We didn't do anything to her.

290
00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:28.320
She did that to herself.

291
00:23:36.206 --> 00:23:37.822
Oh, my God.

292
00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:43.377
Promise you won't hurt me?

293
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.802
Hey, you make these?

294
00:24:05.569 --> 00:24:06.900
Hey, buddy.

295
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:08.607
Hey.

296
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:11.364
This is the old Crawford Mill, right?

297
00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:16.110
My name's Erin.

298
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.030
Jedidiah.

299
00:24:24.838 --> 00:24:25.873
Yo, junior.

300
00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:30.007
So we're waiting here for the sheriff.
Do you know where he is?

301
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.881
Okay, well, where?

302
00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:35.554
Home.

303
00:24:35.724 --> 00:24:37.055
Getting drunk.

304
00:24:37.226 --> 00:24:39.058
Cool. Let's split.

305
00:24:39.228 --> 00:24:42.721
If the sheriff doesn't give a shit,
then why should we?

306
00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:45.556
Does he live around here?

307
00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:50.979
You know,
front-row tickets to a big concert.

308
00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:53.072
Can we drive there from here?

309
00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:55.323
Road don't go there.

310
00:24:55.786 --> 00:24:56.821
Short walk though.

311
00:24:57.413 --> 00:25:00.997
I think we should go, like, now.
Like, right now.

312
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.917
How do I get to the sheriff's?

313
00:25:39.705 --> 00:25:41.946
Whoa. Hey, you sick little mutant.

314
00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:48.369
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on, now, let go. Get out of here.

315
00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:50.458
That's police evidence.

316
00:26:26.627 --> 00:26:28.834
Is anybody home?

317
00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:32.667
- Hello?
- What do you want?

318
00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:34.711
Are you the sheriff?

319
00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:37.593
Do I look like a sheriff?

320
00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:41.506
- I don't know, I can't see you.
- Stand back from the door.

321
00:26:50.484 --> 00:26:52.851
Sheriff don't live here.

322
00:26:53.362 --> 00:26:55.319
You can call him if you want to.

323
00:26:55.697 --> 00:26:58.189
Thanks, we'd really appreciate it.

324
00:27:00.369 --> 00:27:01.530
Wipe your feet.

325
00:27:02.204 --> 00:27:04.821
I like to keep a clean house.

326
00:27:10.087 --> 00:27:11.577
I said she could call him.

327
00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:14.213
-You wait outside.
-Okay, chief.

328
00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:17.378
- I ain't looking for trouble.
-Don't shoot.

329
00:27:18.554 --> 00:27:20.420
Terrible.

330
00:27:42.452 --> 00:27:44.693
I'll dial him for you.

331
00:28:06.185 --> 00:28:09.428
- Hello?
- Hi, is this the sheriff's office?

332
00:28:11.273 --> 00:28:12.604
Can I speak to him, please?

333
00:28:27.748 --> 00:28:28.909
Oh, thank God.

334
00:28:53.482 --> 00:28:55.314
It's just an educated guess...

335
00:28:55.484 --> 00:29:00.650
...but my money says
your dead body's right there in that van.

336
00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:04.232
Sheriff's gonna be there
in about 30 minutes.

337
00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:07.447
Thirty minutes?
Believe me, we will be there.

338
00:29:11.959 --> 00:29:13.666
Thanks. I'm all set.

339
00:29:15.629 --> 00:29:19.668
Wait, wait.
Can you help me out back here?

340
00:29:34.273 --> 00:29:35.809
Are you okay?

341
00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:38.645
-Could you just...?
-Okay.

342
00:29:50.205 --> 00:29:52.947
Excuse me. Erin?

343
00:29:54.084 --> 00:29:55.870
Excuse me.

344
00:30:07.347 --> 00:30:08.929
Erin?

345
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.433
Excuse me, you mind
getting the fuck out of my way, son?

346
00:30:23.697 --> 00:30:27.156
We picked her up
on the side of the road, like...

347
00:30:27.326 --> 00:30:31.035
Wow. Look at that mess.

348
00:30:41.631 --> 00:30:43.247
Who does this belong to?

349
00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:48.882
- She had that on her, sir.
- You don't say.

350
00:30:49.348 --> 00:30:52.932
-Had it on her?
-Yes, Sir.

351
00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:05.937
Okay, you can just relax,
because you're not helping.

352
00:31:11.745 --> 00:31:14.112
Good girl. Good girl.

353
00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:22.669
Pigsty.

354
00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:40.475
Oh, Jesus.

355
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.391
What the hell was that?

356
00:32:28.738 --> 00:32:30.445
Kemper?

357
00:32:31.408 --> 00:32:33.149
Kemp?

358
00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:45.210
Well, let's get her wrapped up.

359
00:32:52.888 --> 00:32:54.879
Oh, pretty little thing.

360
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:58.553
How about giving me a hand here,
asshole?

361
00:33:00.562 --> 00:33:03.475
You don't expect me
to do this by myself?

362
00:33:04.024 --> 00:33:06.061
I need some help.

363
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.062
Always getting yanked into this shit.
What am I doing?

364
00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:14.482
Lift her up and just kind of
pull her over your way there.

365
00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:17.242
She ain't gonna bite you.
She's deader than a doornail.

366
00:33:17.412 --> 00:33:21.121
-Get a hold of her and pick her up.
-Yes, sir.

367
00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:26.543
Yeah. There you go.

368
00:33:27.923 --> 00:33:29.334
I'll bet she's real unhappy.

369
00:33:29.508 --> 00:33:34.753
Real sorry that you're getting fucking
her blood all over your goddamn arm.

370
00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:39.049
You know,
back when I was a young patrolman...

371
00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:41.467
...I used to love wrapping up
these young honeys.

372
00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:42.680
I'll bet you did.

373
00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:46.392
Cop me a little bit of a feel
every now and then, you know?

374
00:33:47.651 --> 00:33:48.891
Oh, shit.

375
00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:51.648
Look at that.
She's kind of wet down there.

376
00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:54.438
What you boys been doing
with this dead body, anyway?

377
00:33:54.616 --> 00:33:56.903
Can we please finish this?

378
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.207
Kemper?

379
00:34:07.921 --> 00:34:09.503
Kemp?

380
00:34:36.825 --> 00:34:37.986
Something wrong?

381
00:34:38.785 --> 00:34:41.322
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

382
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:43.327
But he's not in my house.

383
00:34:44.624 --> 00:34:46.160
Thanks.

384
00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:55.590
Kemper?

385
00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:01.388
Kemp?

386
00:35:05.687 --> 00:35:07.724
Goddamn him.

387
00:35:08.732 --> 00:35:11.315
Okay, boys, there you go. There she is.

388
00:35:11.693 --> 00:35:13.354
Let's get her out of there now.

389
00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:15.360
You, four-eyes, get a hold of her legs.

390
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.522
-Get after that part of her.
-Push, go.

391
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.743
-Okay. Come on.
-Ow!

392
00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:24.532
Jesus.

393
00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:27.664
- This is ridiculous.
- We'll just stick her in the back seat.

394
00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:30.955
It just seems so wrong.

395
00:35:32.255 --> 00:35:34.792
Don't give me any crap, young lady.

396
00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:39.210
Goddamn it, I got just as much respect
for a dead body as anybody around here.

397
00:35:40.513 --> 00:35:46.179
Hey, get that nasty goddamn thing
out of the back seat of my goddamn car.

398
00:35:46.353 --> 00:35:49.596
Put it in the trunk.
What the hell's the matter with you?

399
00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:53.516
-Don't break my-- Don't break my stuff.
-Get the legs.

400
00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:55.354
Put the legs in.

401
00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:05.486
Y'all gonna be able
to find your way out of here?

402
00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:08.326
- Yeah. Yeah, we'll be fine.
- All right, then.

403
00:36:10.502 --> 00:36:13.790
Protect and serve. That's what we do.

404
00:36:13.963 --> 00:36:15.920
That you did, sir.

405
00:36:22.764 --> 00:36:24.471
Kemp.

406
00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:33.764
Kemper?

407
00:37:24.993 --> 00:37:26.825
Kemper.

408
00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:39.459
Poor Kemp. He ain't ever
gonna get the stink out of this van.

409
00:37:39.632 --> 00:37:42.215
You think we should we try to clean it
for him?

410
00:37:42.886 --> 00:37:44.718
Be my guest.

411
00:37:51.686 --> 00:37:53.472
Are you okay?

412
00:37:53.646 --> 00:37:55.307
It's too much. I'm gonna be sick.

413
00:37:55.482 --> 00:37:58.474
Okay, good news. Sheriff's on his way.

414
00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:01.234
Sheriff already came.

415
00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:04.153
He took the body.

416
00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:07.194
Where's Kemper?

417
00:38:07.368 --> 00:38:09.029
Wasn't he with you?

418
00:38:13.374 --> 00:38:16.708
- Kemper?
- What the hell is that?

419
00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:19.035
Come here.

420
00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:23.081
Kemper.

421
00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:26.335
Kemp.

422
00:38:39.943 --> 00:38:42.059
There's nobody even here.

423
00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:46.238
- Kemp.
- What was that all about?

424
00:38:49.077 --> 00:38:50.533
Kemper.

425
00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:52.986
What is that?

426
00:38:53.706 --> 00:38:56.573
-Oh, what the--?
-It's somebody's fucking teeth, isn't it?

427
00:38:56.751 --> 00:39:00.335
-Pepper, calm down, all right?
-Erin, find your boyfriend. It's time to go.

428
00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:03.831
Kemper.

429
00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:09.420
Kemp.

430
00:39:17.939 --> 00:39:19.600
Morgan, what are you doing?

431
00:39:24.112 --> 00:39:26.069
Oh, my God.

432
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:30.778
- Pull him out.
- Oh, my God.

433
00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:33.280
- I can't.
- Oh, my God.

434
00:39:34.747 --> 00:39:36.863
- Asshole.
- It's not funny.

435
00:39:41.838 --> 00:39:44.580
Oh, what the hell is that?

436
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.303
Is that the girl from our van?

437
00:39:52.015 --> 00:39:53.505
That's her.

438
00:39:57.103 --> 00:39:59.185
Is that her family?

439
00:40:01.691 --> 00:40:04.058
What were they all doing here?

440
00:40:05.153 --> 00:40:07.235
They were probably
looking for the sheriff.

441
00:40:08.615 --> 00:40:09.821
This is fucking weird.

442
00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:15.240
All right, you know what? Let's find Kemper
and get the hell out of here.

443
00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:19.994
Where are you going?

444
00:40:20.668 --> 00:40:22.250
To find him.

445
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:25.458
Well, where are the keys for the van?

446
00:40:29.177 --> 00:40:31.339
Well, who put you in charge?

447
00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.963
If you guys wanna take off, that's fine.

448
00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:37.758
But I am not getting in that van
and leaving without him.

449
00:40:37.936 --> 00:40:40.974
-Give me the keys.
-Don't even think about it.

450
00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:43.017
Andy.

451
00:40:43.191 --> 00:40:47.185
I don't know about you guys, but I happen
to like my teeth right where they are.

452
00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:50.524
We can't leave him. Let's go.

453
00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:52.856
We'll meet you back at the van.

454
00:41:35.118 --> 00:41:37.735
- I know Kemp's in there.
- Wonderful.

455
00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:40.028
All right, keep him busy.

456
00:41:49.632 --> 00:41:52.750
Hi, it's me again.
I'm really sorry to bother you...

457
00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:55.259
...but I can't find my boyfriend,
Kemper, anywhere.

458
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:56.886
I thought I would just come and--

459
00:41:57.056 --> 00:41:59.093
Ain't you supposed to meet the sheriff?

460
00:42:12.905 --> 00:42:14.441
Kemper.

461
00:42:19.787 --> 00:42:21.949
Kemp, don't mess around.

462
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.918
Wow, what a wonderful garden you have.

463
00:42:28.087 --> 00:42:31.751
It's just so plentiful.

464
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:36.353
Andy?

465
00:43:36.697 --> 00:43:39.530
Hey, you can't just go in my house.

466
00:43:40.493 --> 00:43:42.200
Andy.

467
00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:46.537
Are you okay?

468
00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:48.873
Yeah.

469
00:43:53.047 --> 00:43:55.379
What the hell are you doing in my house?

470
00:43:57.885 --> 00:44:00.718
We're just looking for our friend,
then we'll be out of here.

471
00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:04.848
You ain't running things, boy,
except your mouth.

472
00:44:05.017 --> 00:44:06.553
He sounds crazy.

473
00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:09.386
You little turd.

474
00:44:09.564 --> 00:44:11.726
You're so dead, you don't even know it.

475
00:44:15.403 --> 00:44:18.316
Come on, boy. Bring it.

476
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.071
Bring it.

477
00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:22.528
-Bring what?
-Bring it.

478
00:44:27.582 --> 00:44:28.572
Oh, shit.

479
00:44:33.546 --> 00:44:34.877
Shit.

480
00:44:35.923 --> 00:44:37.038
Erin!

481
00:44:38.259 --> 00:44:40.250
-Come on.
-Andy.

482
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.011
Get the fuck out of here. Run.

483
00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:35.347
Shit! God!

484
00:45:56.337 --> 00:45:57.623
Please.

485
00:45:58.089 --> 00:45:59.500
Please. Stop.

486
00:45:59.674 --> 00:46:02.462
No, please. Please.

487
00:46:02.635 --> 00:46:03.670
Stop.

488
00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:08.839
Shit. Erin! Erin!

489
00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:10.385
Erin!

490
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.023
Kemper really owes us for this.

491
00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:26.359
- What's wrong, Erin?
- Are you okay?

492
00:46:26.534 --> 00:46:27.524
Where's the gun?

493
00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:30.777
-Come on.
-Erin, what's going on?

494
00:46:30.955 --> 00:46:32.366
Where's the gun?

495
00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.531
The sheriff took it.

496
00:46:34.709 --> 00:46:36.040
Shit.

497
00:46:36.877 --> 00:46:38.788
Erin, what the fuck's going on?
Calm down.

498
00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:39.998
-Erin.
-Fuck.

499
00:46:40.172 --> 00:46:41.333
-What?
-What?

500
00:46:44.385 --> 00:46:46.467
- Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.
- Take it easy.

501
00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:48.219
-Thank God.
-Take it easy.

502
00:46:48.389 --> 00:46:49.675
My friend needs help.

503
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:52.762
My friend, right now. My friend's dying.
My friend's being hurt.

504
00:46:52.935 --> 00:46:54.972
Settle down.
Take a couple of deep breaths.

505
00:46:55.146 --> 00:46:57.012
- There's some guy--
- Shh, shh.

506
00:46:57.898 --> 00:46:59.229
Just quiet down.

507
00:47:01.027 --> 00:47:02.734
-Please.
-What's wrong with your car?

508
00:47:02.903 --> 00:47:05.395
There's nothing wrong with my car.

509
00:47:05.573 --> 00:47:07.940
- Whoa.
- It's my friend.

510
00:47:08.326 --> 00:47:11.990
Please help him.
I don't know where he is anymore.

511
00:47:12.163 --> 00:47:14.200
Somebody wanna explain this?

512
00:47:16.751 --> 00:47:20.665
-It's not mine, sir.
-You kids taking drugs?

513
00:47:21.047 --> 00:47:22.833
- No.
- No.

514
00:47:23.007 --> 00:47:24.918
It's not our van.

515
00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:31.672
I smell bullshit.

516
00:47:32.767 --> 00:47:33.882
No.

517
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.892
-My friend--
-Get out of the van.

518
00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:37.389
Out.

519
00:47:41.484 --> 00:47:45.352
On your faces. All three of you.

520
00:47:46.947 --> 00:47:48.233
Get on the ground.

521
00:48:03.297 --> 00:48:05.083
No. No.

522
00:49:00.688 --> 00:49:02.599
Arizona.

523
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:04.931
Colorado.

524
00:49:06.235 --> 00:49:08.818
-New York.
-Please, you've gotta help him.

525
00:49:08.988 --> 00:49:11.605
There's a-- He's fucking killing him.

526
00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:14.315
- Now we're getting some place.
- Come on. Please.

527
00:49:14.493 --> 00:49:15.779
Who's killing who?

528
00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:18.786
There's a fucking guy
with a fucking chainsaw.

529
00:49:18.956 --> 00:49:24.827
Get your sweet little ass back in the dirt
until I say otherwise.

530
00:49:28.716 --> 00:49:30.002
You know what I think?

531
00:49:30.176 --> 00:49:34.545
I think your boyfriend shot that little girl
and then he ran off.

532
00:49:34.722 --> 00:49:37.339
He did not. Some fucking guy with a--

533
00:49:39.894 --> 00:49:42.852
-Stop, stop.
-We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die!

534
00:49:43.022 --> 00:49:46.890
You girls better get yourselves under
control or I'm gonna have to do it for you.

535
00:49:47.067 --> 00:49:48.978
Why won't you listen to her?

536
00:49:50.404 --> 00:49:51.815
Get on your feet.

537
00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.355
Get over by the van.

538
00:49:54.742 --> 00:49:57.279
- Please, stop.
- We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

539
00:49:57.453 --> 00:49:58.818
We're gonna die, we're--

540
00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:02.576
I wanna know exactly
what happened inside that van.

541
00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:07.168
-We already told you what happened.
-And now you're gonna show me.

542
00:50:08.881 --> 00:50:10.246
Get in.

543
00:50:57.638 --> 00:50:59.379
Is that where she was sitting?

544
00:50:59.974 --> 00:51:04.889
Because the angle don't add up for me
with the blood on that back window.

545
00:51:14.697 --> 00:51:17.109
Maybe she was a bit more in the middle.

546
00:51:17.408 --> 00:51:21.902
Well, maybe you ought to move
a little more over to the middle.

547
00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:24.077
But...

548
00:51:26.458 --> 00:51:29.246
What, are you afraid of a little blood?

549
00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:33.917
Get the fuck over there!

550
00:51:40.639 --> 00:51:43.427
I don't have much of an imagination.

551
00:51:43.601 --> 00:51:48.016
So I need to get a distinct image...

552
00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.471
...of what went down here.

553
00:51:50.983 --> 00:51:52.599
What'd she do next?

554
00:51:54.194 --> 00:51:55.559
She...

555
00:51:57.072 --> 00:52:00.531
-She shot herself.
-Oh, she shot herself.

556
00:52:00.993 --> 00:52:02.028
You don't say.

557
00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:05.578
-How?
-What do you mean, "how"?

558
00:52:08.334 --> 00:52:09.665
Take the gun.

559
00:52:10.419 --> 00:52:13.753
Take the gun
and show me how she did it.

560
00:52:13.922 --> 00:52:15.378
Come on.

561
00:52:15.716 --> 00:52:17.502
Take the gun.

562
00:52:17.676 --> 00:52:20.293
Take the gun and show me.

563
00:52:20.888 --> 00:52:22.219
Take the goddamn gun!

564
00:52:29.897 --> 00:52:31.353
Is that how she did it?

565
00:52:32.941 --> 00:52:34.147
Yes.

566
00:52:34.318 --> 00:52:36.184
-Yes, Sir.
-You're a fucking liar.

567
00:52:36.362 --> 00:52:39.900
There ain't no hole
in the bottom of her chin. I looked.

568
00:52:40.074 --> 00:52:46.411
She stuck the goddamn weapon
into her mouth, didn't she?

569
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.537
Show me how she did it.

570
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.246
-Please.
-Do it.

571
00:52:54.421 --> 00:52:55.957
Show me.

572
00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.256
Please, please, please.

573
00:52:59.426 --> 00:53:01.918
-Attaboy. There you go.
-Please, please, don't.

574
00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:04.591
And then what'd she do?

575
00:53:05.265 --> 00:53:06.755
She shot herself.

576
00:53:06.934 --> 00:53:09.266
-You ain't lying to me again, are you?
-No.

577
00:53:09.436 --> 00:53:12.895
Because I have never seen a weapon go off
without somebody's finger...

578
00:53:13.065 --> 00:53:14.772
...on the fucking trigger.

579
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:17.271
Morgan, what's going on?

580
00:53:17.444 --> 00:53:18.434
You okay?

581
00:53:18.612 --> 00:53:21.070
You girls stay in the dirt
till I tell you different.

582
00:53:22.616 --> 00:53:25.950
You motherfucker.
Get on the fucking floor.

583
00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.237
- I said, get on the floor!
-What the hell are you doing?

584
00:53:30.165 --> 00:53:32.953
- What are you gonna do, shoot me?
- Morgan, please, please.

585
00:53:33.127 --> 00:53:35.915
Just please put the gun down, okay?
Please don't do it.

586
00:53:36.088 --> 00:53:37.123
Oh, my God, Morgan.

587
00:53:37.297 --> 00:53:40.255
-You lying fuck.
-You could kill me right now.

588
00:53:40.426 --> 00:53:42.463
Get out of here scot-free, couldn't you?

589
00:53:42.636 --> 00:53:44.968
Morgan, please. Just put it down.

590
00:53:45.139 --> 00:53:47.972
He shoots me,
you're accomplice to murder.

591
00:53:49.059 --> 00:53:50.845
- Morgan, please.
- You two...

592
00:53:51.019 --> 00:53:53.101
-...you're just as guilty as him.
-Please. Come on.

593
00:53:53.272 --> 00:53:56.890
-Morgan!
-Do it! Fucking shoot him!

594
00:53:57.484 --> 00:53:59.646
- You put the gun down.
- Morgan, shoot him.

595
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:03.484
-Don't fucking do it, please.
-You don't have the fucking balls, do you?

596
00:54:03.657 --> 00:54:06.570
- Morgan, don't shoot him!
- Shoot him, shoot him!

597
00:54:06.744 --> 00:54:08.075
Pull the fucking trigger!

598
00:54:08.704 --> 00:54:09.910
Fuck you.

599
00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:17.331
Well, well, well. Lookie here.

600
00:54:18.005 --> 00:54:20.918
-Oh, my God, Morgan.
-We got ourselves a killer.

601
00:54:21.341 --> 00:54:25.460
Only this time, you killed a sheriff.

602
00:54:31.059 --> 00:54:34.927
I ought to blow your fucking brains out
right now, asshole.

603
00:54:35.355 --> 00:54:38.438
Get out of the van. Get out.

604
00:54:39.067 --> 00:54:40.978
Get out of the van.

605
00:54:42.863 --> 00:54:44.649
Morgan.

606
00:54:46.867 --> 00:54:50.110
Where are you taking him?
What are you doing?

607
00:54:50.287 --> 00:54:54.121
- Why are you taking the keys?
- Get the fuck away from me.

608
00:55:47.553 --> 00:55:48.759
Man, this is bullshit.

609
00:55:54.977 --> 00:55:56.888
I have rights.

610
00:55:58.564 --> 00:56:00.350
Yeah, you got rights. Okay.

611
00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:04.062
Where were y'all headed?

612
00:56:04.236 --> 00:56:05.897
Dallas.

613
00:56:06.572 --> 00:56:07.937
Skynyrd concert.

614
00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:11.778
Skynyrd? Hell, I like Skynyrd.

615
00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:16.783
By God, how about that?
We got something in common, don't we?

616
00:56:17.457 --> 00:56:21.416
Well, what are you gonna do
with your tickets now, hotshot?

617
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.507
You can have them.

618
00:56:28.677 --> 00:56:30.634
Is that bribery?

619
00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:38.968
Oh, that was really rude, wasn't it?

620
00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:42.976
Oh, look at you.

621
00:56:45.527 --> 00:56:46.983
How about that?

622
00:56:50.616 --> 00:56:54.610
Look at that shit.
We got something else in common now.

623
00:56:56.163 --> 00:56:57.745
See that?

624
00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:08.831
Get on over to the damn Crawford Mill.

625
00:57:09.009 --> 00:57:10.966
Those two fillies are good to go.

626
00:57:19.227 --> 00:57:21.594
-Shit.
-What do you think he's doing to Morgan?

627
00:57:21.772 --> 00:57:24.389
I don't wanna think about it, okay?

628
00:57:30.697 --> 00:57:32.438
Oh, shit.

629
00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:37.242
Pepper, I need you to hold that light
really steady.

630
00:57:37.412 --> 00:57:38.652
Can you do that?

631
00:57:49.883 --> 00:57:52.625
-Where did you learn how to do that?
-In juvie.

632
00:57:52.803 --> 00:57:55.010
They called my youth misspent.

633
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:56.841
Oh, thank God.

634
00:58:16.576 --> 00:58:18.533
-Get out of the car.
-Where are we?

635
00:58:18.704 --> 00:58:20.991
It's none of your goddamn business,
faggot.

636
00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:23.656
Just get out of the goddamn car.

637
00:58:32.092 --> 00:58:34.550
You kids shouldn't have messed
with that little girl.

638
00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:40.297
You brought this all on yourself.

639
00:58:40.475 --> 00:58:43.558
Now get the hell in the house.

640
00:58:46.064 --> 00:58:48.396
-Come on, please.
-Come on.

641
00:58:51.486 --> 00:58:53.102
-Come on, please.
-Come on, Erin, come on.

642
00:58:54.781 --> 00:58:55.771
-Yes.
-Yes.

643
00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:01.610
Go, go, go.

644
00:59:17.512 --> 00:59:19.469
Go! Go!

645
00:59:53.507 --> 00:59:55.248
Get out, Pepper, now.

646
01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:06.767
Pepper.

647
01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.519
Run.

648
01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:20.656
No! No, Pepper.

649
01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.493
Please, please. Please, let me in.

650
01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.749
Please. Help me, please.

651
01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.026
Why don't you have a seat?

652
01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:42.525
It's okay. Sit down.

653
01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.365
Have a seat.

654
01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:48.778
Turn that thing off.
He's gonna fucking hear it.

655
01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:03.884
There's nothing a good old cup of tea
won't settle.

656
01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:09.807
Nobody's gonna come through that door.

657
01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:13.310
I really need to use your phone.

658
01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:15.429
I don't have one.

659
01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:17.602
No.

660
01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:21.109
Phones are a hassle.

661
01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:24.487
No. Don't you get it?

662
01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:27.150
He's gonna kill you.
He's gonna kill all of us.

663
01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:32.322
-Oh, no, he won't.
-Yes, he will.

664
01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:36.743
He knows better
than to be messing around here.

665
01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:43.086
Everyone around here
knows that poor, sweet boy.

666
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.500
Sweet boy.

667
01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.839
He's no harm.

668
01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:49.505
He always keeps to himself.

669
01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.475
Skin disease.

670
01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.513
He was just a little boy when it started.

671
01:02:57.691 --> 01:03:00.103
Didn't you look at his face?

672
01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:04.311
I couldn't. I couldn't look.

673
01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:07.072
Oh, sweetie.

674
01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:08.824
Here.

675
01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:12.194
Here, it's just right.

676
01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:16.206
Come drink some before it gets cold.

677
01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:18.788
You have no idea.

678
01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:24.214
-Hush, now.
-I don't wanna drink any more tea.

679
01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:25.465
I just need a phone.

680
01:03:27.012 --> 01:03:29.049
-Please.
-Now see what you've done?

681
01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.094
Oh. Heh-heh.

682
01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:35.054
That wasn't a good idea.

683
01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:44.355
Now drink up your tea.

684
01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:46.653
It'll help you relax.

685
01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:49.064
I'll be right back.

686
01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:57.164
You're a little tense.

687
01:03:57.459 --> 01:03:58.824
You should relax.

688
01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:44.415
I better go now.

689
01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:51.802
You okay, child? You don't look so good.

690
01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:56.928
I thought you said
you didn't have a have a phone.

691
01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:01.304
It's okay. It's okay.

692
01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:06.892
That's not your baby.

693
01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.272
You stole her!

694
01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:16.319
She's mine.

695
01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:39.342
Oh, my.

696
01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:41.135
Oh, my, my, my.

697
01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:44.304
Everything's gonna be fine real soon.

698
01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:46.810
I promise.

699
01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:04.370
Give her some room.

700
01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:07.957
Maybe she'd like to stay for supper.

701
01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:11.381
Messed up everything already.
Stop bothering her.

702
01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:13.713
Grandma. Let me in now.

703
01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:19.553
You best stay out there with them dogs
till you learn how to play by the rules.

704
01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:23.515
You're not going nowhere, honey.

705
01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:29.395
Please. Please, just let me go.

706
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:31.901
I know your kind.

707
01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:36.232
Nothing but cruelty and ridicule
for my boy...

708
01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:39.618
...all the time he was growing up.

709
01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:45.916
Does anybody care
about me and my boy?

710
01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:50.086
- Huh?
- Don't hurt her.

711
01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:52.714
-Please, Grandma, don't--
-You shut up out there.

712
01:06:52.884 --> 01:06:56.297
Help me!
Please, will you make them stop?

713
01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:59.589
- Lookie, Mama, she likes me.
- Stop!

714
01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:03.426
What's wrong with you fucking people?

715
01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:05.435
Nothing wrong with us.

716
01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:08.226
- Tommy.
- Help me, please.

717
01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:12.518
Thomas Brown Hewitt,
you get in here right now.

718
01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:16.112
No!

719
01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.398
- No!
- Get her out of my sight.

720
01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:20.442
No, please, no. Please.

721
01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:23.323
Please.

722
01:07:23.498 --> 01:07:26.286
- Will you cut out that racket?
- No! No!

723
01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.075
No!

724
01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:30.039
Here's your pants.

725
01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.625
Thank you, Mama.

726
01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.633
No.

727
01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:17.499
Oh, my God.

728
01:08:58.092 --> 01:08:59.548
Erin.

729
01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.047
I can't...

730
01:09:02.597 --> 01:09:03.632
Erin, no. No.

731
01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:05.717
- Okay.
- No.

732
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.892
Lift your body.

733
01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:11.053
Lift your body up.

734
01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:13.729
- Stop!
- Push.

735
01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:19.728
Stop!

736
01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:24.574
Lift your-- Lift your body.

737
01:09:33.878 --> 01:09:35.414
Sorry.

738
01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:40.711
Erin, please.

739
01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:44.086
Please, finish it.

740
01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:47.179
Erin, do it.

741
01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:49.924
I can't.

742
01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:53.269
I can't.

743
01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.555
-I can't.
-There's a knife.

744
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:28.551
Erin.

745
01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:33.968
Erin.

746
01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:38.397
Do it. Do it.

747
01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:42.736
-I can't.
-Do it.

748
01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.566
I can't do it.

749
01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:47.357
Do it.

750
01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.329
Do it. Do it.

751
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:18.021
Please forgive me.

752
01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.853
Please forgive me.

753
01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:14.243
Morgan, it's me.

754
01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:17.910
No!

755
01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:22.078
Morgan, it's Erin.
Morgan, it's me. It's Erin.

756
01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:24.212
It's Erin. Come on.

757
01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:36.098
- Come on. Over here.
- Okay.

758
01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:38.514
We gotta go.

759
01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.263
Come on, now.

760
01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:44.398
- Now.
- Okay, Morgan.

761
01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:46.936
Come on. Morgan, get up.

762
01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:53.112
- Over here.
- Let's go. Walk.

763
01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:55.118
I need you to lean on me.

764
01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:08.585
Run. Faster.

765
01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:10.625
- Hurry. Come on.
- Keep going, keep going.

766
01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:18.098

767
01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:19.976

771
01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:36.659
Come on. Don't let him get you.
Come on.

772
01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:38.445
- Come on, Morgan.
- Get up there.

773
01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:48.124
-Come on.
-Go, go, go.

774
01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:18.451
Come on, Morgan. Come on.

775
01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:03.162
Morgan, the couch.

776
01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:05.240
The couch.

777
01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:31.224
Come on.

778
01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:33.814
Quick.

779
01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:35.695
Shit.

780
01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:39.106
Come on.

781
01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:42.743
Shit.

782
01:15:59.764 --> 01:16:01.129
Come on.

783
01:17:49.456 --> 01:17:52.289
No! No!

784
01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:06.261
Run! Run!

785
01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.431
Erin.

786
01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:13.932
Morgan!

787
01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:23.692
Get off him!

788
01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:25.948
Get off him!

789
01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:36.553
No. Stop.

790
01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.346
Stop. Please.

791
01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:41.399
Stop.

792
01:19:41.568 --> 01:19:43.275
Help me. Please.

793
01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.106
Please, I need help.

794
01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:46.692
Help. Help.

795
01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:49.065
Let me in.

796
01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:04.500
Oh, my God.

797
01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:51.432
Hey!

798
01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:57.609
Hey!

799
01:25:42.262 --> 01:25:44.378
Goddamn it.

800
01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:46.714
Come on.

801
01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.153
Stop!

802
01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:06.859
Stop!

803
01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:09.404
Please, stop!

804
01:26:21.218 --> 01:26:24.586
Hey there. You all right?

805
01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:27.588
Are you okay?

806
01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:32.560
Here. Come on,
let's get in my truck over here.

807
01:26:45.617 --> 01:26:47.608
You in a car wreck?

808
01:26:50.497 --> 01:26:52.283
Where are we going?

809
01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:55.290
I'm gonna get you some help.

810
01:26:55.627 --> 01:26:57.584
Honey, what's your name?

811
01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:03.458
Huh?

812
01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:06.586
I just wanna go home.

813
01:27:07.013 --> 01:27:08.549
You live around here?

814
01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:12.216
No.

815
01:27:16.773 --> 01:27:18.263
No. No.

816
01:27:18.859 --> 01:27:20.395
-No.
-Hey.

817
01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:23.561
-I can't go back there.
-Get off of me.

818
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:28.108
-Keep going.
-Stop it.

819
01:27:30.704 --> 01:27:32.615
No. Keep going.

820
01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:39.668
-What the hell--?
-Please, don't stop.

821
01:27:44.301 --> 01:27:47.510
I don't know what your problem is,
but I can't take this.

822
01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:50.922
Don't get out. Don't get out!

823
01:28:15.457 --> 01:28:17.619
Hello in there. Hello. Help.

824
01:28:17.793 --> 01:28:20.285
- Ma'am, help. I need some help out here.
- What is it?

825
01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:22.203
- What do you want?
- I picked up a girl.

826
01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.997
She's bloody. She's out here in my truck.

827
01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:28.835
Junior. Junior, come on out here.

828
01:28:31.932 --> 01:28:33.514
Come on.

829
01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:37.100
Henrietta, get me my raincoat.

830
01:28:38.855 --> 01:28:41.017
I need some help out here. Let's see.

831
01:28:41.191 --> 01:28:42.852
Henrietta?

832
01:28:43.026 --> 01:28:44.312
I gave her a ride.

833
01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:46.568
I found her
right down the highway.

834
01:28:46.738 --> 01:28:48.445
I don't know her name.

835
01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:54.159
Yeah. Well, she grabbed the steering wheel
and dang near ran me off the road.

836
01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:57.663
She nearly caused us to crash.
Yeah, she grabbed it while I was driving.

837
01:28:58.959 --> 01:29:02.577
She's out there.
She's out there in the truck.

838
01:29:13.431 --> 01:29:15.297
Well, I think she's there.

839
01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:17.432
She's out there in the truck.

840
01:29:17.602 --> 01:29:19.184
The baby's gone.

841
01:29:30.323 --> 01:29:32.064
Come on, come on.

842
01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:33.698
Come on.

843
01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:39.075
Come on.

844
01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:02.810
Come on, you little bitch, start.

845
01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:18.151
Fuck you!

846
01:30:52.405 --> 01:30:54.567
You asshole!

847
01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:47.704
This is August 20th, 1973.

848
01:31:47.877 --> 01:31:50.209
Location is the Hewitt residence.

849
01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:53.247
We're gonna go move
into the actual furnace room.

850
01:31:53.425 --> 01:31:54.915
Watch yourself.

851
01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:57.167
Look out.

852
01:31:57.345 --> 01:32:00.679
Oh, man. Ugh.

853
01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:03.682
Look out. You got it?

854
01:32:04.436 --> 01:32:05.471
All right.

855
01:32:05.645 --> 01:32:09.684
This is the actual furnace room
we're going into...

856
01:32:09.858 --> 01:32:13.317
...where they expected to perpetrated--

857
01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:15.773
Got a bit of a jump there.

858
01:32:16.281 --> 01:32:19.023
- Got it?
- That's okay. Don't worry.

859
01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.487
Come on back here. Follow me.

860
01:32:31.755 --> 01:32:35.589
The crime scene was not
properly secured by Travis County police.

861
01:32:35.759 --> 01:32:38.842
Two investigating officers
were fatally wounded that day.

862
01:32:40.138 --> 01:32:43.051
This is the only known image
of Thomas Hewitt...

863
01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:46.307
...the man they call Leatherface.

864
01:32:46.811 --> 01:32:49.052
The case today still remains open.
