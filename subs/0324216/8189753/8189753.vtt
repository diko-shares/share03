00:00:54.097 --> 00:00:55.963
The film which you are about to see...

2
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.804
...Is an account of the tragedy
which befell a group of five youths.

3
00:01:01.813 --> 00:01:04.931
It is all the more tragic
in that they were young.

4
00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:09.443
But had they lived very, very long lives,
they could not have expected...

5
00:01:09.612 --> 00:01:13.276
...nor would they have wished to see
as much of the mad and macabre...

6
00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:15.565
...as they were to see that day.

7
00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.828
For them, an idyllic summer afternoon
became a nightmare.

8
00:01:21.416 --> 00:01:24.158
For 30 years, the files collected dust...

9
00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:28.249
...in the Cold Cases division
of the Travis County Police Department.

10
00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:36.011
Over 1300 pieces of evidence
were collected from the crime scene...

11
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.012
...al the Hewitt residence.

12
00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:48.857
Yet none of the evidence
was more compelling...

13
00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:53.820
...than the classified police footage
of the crime-scene walkthrough.

14
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.322
Test, test, test.

15
00:01:56.492 --> 00:02:00.030
Okay, this is August 20th, 1973.

16
00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:02.912
The time is 3:47 p.m.

17
00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:07.201
Location is the Hewitt residence
on Route 17.

18
00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:09.915
It's where victim one was found.

19
00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:11.375
Gonna do a walkthrough.

20
00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.964
And we're now descending the stairs
into the furnace room.

21
00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:17.423
Uh...

22
00:02:17.597 --> 00:02:21.261
There's-- Over here.
There's scratch marks along the wall.

23
00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:23.425
There's some more over here.

24
00:02:23.603 --> 00:02:24.718
Right along here and--

25
00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:27.354
Oh, there's something over here
it seems.

26
00:02:27.523 --> 00:02:30.436
Looks like a clot of hair...

27
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.069
...and an embedded fingernail.

28
00:02:34.864 --> 00:02:38.107
All right, we're gonna go move
into the actual furnace room.

29
00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:41.618
The events of that day were to lead
to one of the most bizarre crimes...

30
00:02:41.788 --> 00:02:44.075
...In the annals of American history:

31
00:02:44.248 --> 00:02:46.080
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

32
00:02:49.754 --> 00:02:52.837
Go. Hold on, hold on.
Don't let go. Not yet, not yet, not yet.

33
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:54.418
Yeah, now, now. Let go.

34
00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:58.251
Turn it up.

35
00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:04.383
Whoo!

36
00:03:16.906 --> 00:03:18.692
Somebody please make her stop singing.

37
00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:26.538
- I think you got a beautiful voice, baby.
-Thank you.

38
00:03:36.968 --> 00:03:40.461
Can you believe
we didn't even know each other yesterday?

39
00:03:42.348 --> 00:03:46.182
I know. It's just amazing.

40
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.766
You know what's even more amazing?

41
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.975
Hello?

42
00:03:52.692 --> 00:03:55.901
Hello? Can we get a pause or halftime?

43
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.687
Okay, the fact that 33,000 Americans
each day...

44
00:03:58.865 --> 00:04:01.357
...are infected
with a sexually transmitted disease...

45
00:04:01.534 --> 00:04:04.492
...and two thirds of them
are just about your age.

46
00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:13.668
Hey, Morgan. How are you the expert
on the dumbest shit?

47
00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:26.510
What are the odds
of you guys passing through El Paso...

48
00:04:26.684 --> 00:04:28.391
...just as I started to hitch?

49
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:31.144
I mean, it's like synchronicity.

50
00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:36.688
It's like LSD.
It's like this shit does not just happen.

51
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.612
Oh, baby, they gotta play "Freebird."

52
00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:47.118
They have to.
We paid a fortune for these tickets.

53
00:04:47.288 --> 00:04:50.155
Yo, Kemp, can you do something
about the AC back here? I'm melting.

54
00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:52.702
No.

55
00:04:53.628 --> 00:04:57.371
But if you or Pepper get too hot,
you could always take your clothes off.

56
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:02.209
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- You are such a perv.

57
00:05:03.012 --> 00:05:06.676
-Don't listen to him, Pepper.
-Why not? I think he's funny.

58
00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.051
She's only known you for 19 hours.

59
00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.893
I've lived with him for three years,
and trust me, he is not funny.

60
00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:28.160
- Morgan, hey, let me see that.
- Hey.

61
00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:29.819
-Careful, man.
-Thank you.

62
00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:33.160
I think I can manage, college boy. Erin.

63
00:05:33.334 --> 00:05:35.701
Oh, no, thank you. I'm nauseous.

64
00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:37.243
Montezuma's revenge.

65
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:40.254
-I was, like, "Erin, don't drink the water."
-I didn't.

66
00:05:40.424 --> 00:05:43.257
And she didn't drink the tequila,
she didn't drink the weed--

67
00:05:43.427 --> 00:05:45.259
Smoke the weed.

68
00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:50.845
Well, maybe I didn't go to Mexico
to watch you get shitfaced for four days.

69
00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:53.305
That is what people do
when they go to Mexico.

70
00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.641
-What did you expect?
-I don't know.

71
00:05:55.815 --> 00:05:58.432
A tear-cut diamond ring...

72
00:05:58.609 --> 00:06:01.943
...that goes right here
on my beautiful little finger?

73
00:06:02.572 --> 00:06:05.940
-We are gonna get you a ring someday.
-I heard that one before.

74
00:06:07.618 --> 00:06:09.108
Peace offering.

75
00:06:16.252 --> 00:06:18.368
Oops. Oh.

76
00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:20.537
- That was so not so cool.
- Hey, guys, take it down.

77
00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:23.715
Guys, relax, it's not like
we don't have 2 pounds of--

78
00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:26.297
Oh, great.

79
00:06:27.763 --> 00:06:29.470
-What did you say?
-I don't remember.

80
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.257
Look, I'm sorry. I got bad brain cells.

81
00:06:32.435 --> 00:06:34.893
Two pounds of pot.
Does that refresh your memory?

82
00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:37.770
Don't listen to him.
He's baked and he's stupid.

83
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.649
Baby, will you please tell me
that we did not go to Mexico to buy pot?

84
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.152
We did not go to Mexico to buy pot.

85
00:06:46.198 --> 00:06:48.314
Hey, come on, baby.

86
00:06:48.492 --> 00:06:52.326
Look at me.
I am not a dope smuggler, okay?

87
00:06:52.705 --> 00:06:54.662
-Tell me how much you love me.
-That much.

88
00:06:54.832 --> 00:06:56.994
-How much? That much?
-That much. This much.

89
00:06:57.168 --> 00:06:58.658
That's it. That's it.

90
00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.668
-Give me a kiss.
-That much.

91
00:07:02.798 --> 00:07:06.257
- Can you drive responsibly?
- I gotta drive.

92
00:07:07.178 --> 00:07:08.509
-Look out.
-Shit.

93
00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:10.716
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, fuck.

94
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.306
You almost hit her.

95
00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:21.564
What the fuck was she doing
walking in the middle of the road?

96
00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:30.027
Asshole.

97
00:07:30.952 --> 00:07:32.363
Hello?

98
00:07:32.536 --> 00:07:34.618
Hey, are you okay?

99
00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:38.373
Boys, that's a bad acid trip
walking right there.

100
00:07:38.793 --> 00:07:41.160
Hello? Can you hear us?

101
00:07:41.337 --> 00:07:43.044
You're gonna get killed doing that.

102
00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:45.542
Kemp, stop the van.

103
00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:47.673
Fuck that, we got a concert to go to.

104
00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:51.302
We're still three fucking hours
from Dallas. Where are you going?

105
00:07:51.472 --> 00:07:53.133
We'll get there.

106
00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:57.263
- I've gotta get away.
- Hey.

107
00:07:58.646 --> 00:08:00.978
I just need to get away.

108
00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:02.183
What?

109
00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:05.395
-Gotta get away.
-From who?

110
00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:07.310
I wanna go home.

111
00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:10.071
Okay, we can't leave her
out here like this.

112
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:12.278
Hey, let us help you, okay?

113
00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:14.033
Come on.

114
00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:17.662
- Come on. It's okay.
- It's okay.

115
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:22.329
It's okay, man, we'll give you a ride
wherever you wanna go.

116
00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:24.244
I wanna go home.

117
00:08:24.422 --> 00:08:26.254
Okay, we can take you home.

118
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.142
Um, what's your name?

119
00:08:48.446 --> 00:08:49.936
They're all dead.

120
00:08:52.867 --> 00:08:56.280
Oh, my God.
I am way too stoned for this.

121
00:08:57.788 --> 00:09:00.780
Baby, let's find a hospital, okay?

122
00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:05.043
You know what? Give me the vaguest idea
where there is one, we'll go there.

123
00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:07.044
Um, who's dead?

124
00:09:10.885 --> 00:09:14.549
Kemper, didn't your mother ever tell you
not to pick up hitchhikers?

125
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.892
No.

126
00:09:23.439 --> 00:09:25.305
You're going the wrong way.

127
00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:28.141
Stop. You're going the wrong way.

128
00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:30.606
- Hey.
- You're going the wrong way.

129
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.066
Sit down.

130
00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:38.989
- Jesus Christ.
- I can't go back there.

131
00:09:39.455 --> 00:09:41.162
You can't make me go back there.

132
00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:43.827
I won't go back there.

133
00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:45.617
Back where?

134
00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:51.338
She's all fucked up.

135
00:09:51.634 --> 00:09:52.965
No.

136
00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:55.718
He's a bad man.

137
00:09:56.013 --> 00:09:57.754
He's a really bad man.

138
00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:06.975
He's a bad man.

139
00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:10.399
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, God.

140
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:15.647
You're all gonna die.

141
00:10:15.825 --> 00:10:17.156
Grab it. Grab it.

142
00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:26.540
Oh, my God!

143
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.826
Oh, my God!

144
00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:32.375
Let me out!

145
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.712
Oh, my God!

146
00:10:40.182 --> 00:10:41.217
Oh, my God.

147
00:10:55.865 --> 00:10:58.903
-You all right?
-That's too much. I'm okay, I'm okay.

148
00:11:01.704 --> 00:11:04.162
-Oh, my God!
-Take it easy. Let me see it.

149
00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:06.242
-It's all over.
-There's nothing there.

150
00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:09.034
-It's gone. Look.
-I could have fucking died out there.

151
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:11.202
We all could have, Morgan.

152
00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:14.126
That didn't just happen.

153
00:11:18.095 --> 00:11:19.927
I've never seen anybody die before.

154
00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:22.714
Yeah, most people never do.

155
00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:25.591
I don't see
how that's helping us right now.

156
00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:28.352
I don't know why we had to pick her up.

157
00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:31.730
Why the fuck did we have to stop?

158
00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:35.936
-She needed help.
-Yeah, a lot of fucking help we did her.

159
00:11:36.113 --> 00:11:37.945
Leave her alone.

160
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:40.065
Fuck.

161
00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:44.823
I just don't understand.

162
00:11:45.456 --> 00:11:49.199
Why did she do it?
And why did she have to pick us?

163
00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:52.619
Why did she have to pick us?

164
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.051
What are we gonna do?

165
00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:07.721
I don't know. We're gonna...

166
00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:11.888
We're gonna have to call the cops,
I guess.

167
00:12:12.066 --> 00:12:15.400
Yeah, on the list of bad ideas,
that one goes way up there.

168
00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:16.775
Are you kidding me?

169
00:12:16.946 --> 00:12:20.280
Officers, as you inspect the crime scene,
which is now our van...

170
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:24.113
...please ignore the pinata filled
with marijuana you happen to come across.

171
00:12:24.286 --> 00:12:28.905
It played no part whatsoever in the demise
of this unfortunate young woman.

172
00:12:29.083 --> 00:12:32.997
Listen, keep your goddamn voice down.

173
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.956
Easy, easy, easy.

174
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.337
Goddamn it.

175
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:46.013
You're not gonna listen to him.

176
00:12:46.183 --> 00:12:48.220
What the fuck are you doing?

177
00:12:54.817 --> 00:12:56.524
It's over.

178
00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:59.936
Kemper,
you just can't throw the shit out.

179
00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:08.077
You okay?

180
00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:12.831
Baby, I'm sorry, okay?

181
00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:15.622
I did it for us.

182
00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:18.879
I did it so we could start a life,
you know.

183
00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:21.131
I'm sorry.

184
00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:23.384
Okay?

185
00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:35.729
I'll tell you this, there's no possible way
I'm ever getting back in that van.

186
00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:51.074
I guess that's what brains look like, huh?

187
00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:56.166
Sort of like...

188
00:13:56.587 --> 00:13:59.579
...lasagna, kind of.

189
00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:03.583
All right, I'll shut up now.

190
00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:13.346
I'll tell you this much...

191
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.683
...the next hitchhiker is shit out of luck,
I swear to God.

192
00:14:17.608 --> 00:14:19.190
Dude, gas station.

193
00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:53.091
Come on, Erin, let's find a bathroom.

194
00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:06.319
Well, I'll be damned.

195
00:15:09.118 --> 00:15:11.485
Ma'am, we need to report a suicide.

196
00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:14.328
Something like this comes along...

197
00:15:14.498 --> 00:15:19.117
...makes folks realize
how crazy the world is out there.

198
00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:20.784
Right.

199
00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:22.670
Would you mind calling the sheriff?

200
00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:25.414
It's gonna cost you 10 cents.

201
00:15:33.392 --> 00:15:34.803
You want some pig?

202
00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:42.018
Shit.

203
00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:50.948
Big brothers.

204
00:15:54.288 --> 00:15:56.199
I just feel so disgusting.

205
00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:03.958
Well, there's about six of them altogether
counting the dead one.

206
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:07.669
Poor thing. It's awful.

207
00:16:09.052 --> 00:16:11.214
Well, why don't you ask them yourself?

208
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.095
Right.

209
00:16:13.265 --> 00:16:15.176
Where'd you say you found her again?

210
00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:19.677
Ma'am, I already told you.
About 10 minutes west of here.

211
00:16:20.898 --> 00:16:23.060
About five miles west.

212
00:16:25.736 --> 00:16:29.229
Ma'am, excuse me,
when is the sheriff gonna be here?

213
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.823
Sheriff said
he's headed over to the old Crawford Mill.

214
00:16:33.577 --> 00:16:34.988
I'm sorry, the what?

215
00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:36.743
The old Crawford Mill.

216
00:16:36.914 --> 00:16:40.873
He wants to know if you wouldn't mind
driving over there to make your report.

217
00:16:41.043 --> 00:16:43.660
Yes. Yes, we goddamn mind.

218
00:16:46.465 --> 00:16:50.379
I'm sorry, but how often do girls just
blow their heads off in this shit-hole town?

219
00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:52.088
Just calm down, okay? Let me--

220
00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:55.425
I'm sorry, I apologize.
But, ma'am, I don't understand.

221
00:16:55.599 --> 00:16:58.057
Why the hell won't the sheriff
just come out here?

222
00:16:58.227 --> 00:16:59.683
Didn't say.

223
00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:02.971
He said it'd be about two hours
before he could get here.

224
00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:07.392
We're not gonna drive around this town
with a dead girl in the back of our van.

225
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.567
Young man...

226
00:17:11.907 --> 00:17:16.071
...what you do is your own business.

227
00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:32.875
Come on.

228
00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:35.886
Get in.

229
00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.350
I just wanna go home, okay?

230
00:17:41.645 --> 00:17:43.477
That's fine.

231
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.807
She's starting to stink back here.

232
00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:28.097
No worse than the inside
of that fucking store.

233
00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:30.312
Did you smell that nasty beef shit?

234
00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:35.020
Oh, my God.

235
00:18:40.329 --> 00:18:41.819
Guys.

236
00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:08.474
Hello?

237
00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:12.850
Hello?

238
00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:24.741
Ain't no sheriff here.

239
00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:29.409
I think we should drop off the body
and get the hell out of here.

240
00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:35.419
-Maybe we should vote on it.
-Kemper, no.

241
00:19:36.677 --> 00:19:40.011
Why not, Erin? It is a democracy.

242
00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.968
How would you like it
if we just dumped your body out here?

243
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:45.929
I'm sorry, nobody asked her
to blow her head off in our van.

244
00:19:46.103 --> 00:19:47.764
My van.

245
00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.021
I say we dump her.

246
00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:57.440
Pig.

247
00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:01.440
Cool. All right, fine. Two votes.

248
00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:03.529
Now we just need one more.

249
00:20:03.704 --> 00:20:05.240
Kemper?

250
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:07.871
One more and we're out of here.

251
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.078
Kemper, please.

252
00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:19.375
Baby, she's dead.

253
00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:22.465
I just...

254
00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.802
I really don't think it matters
where we leave her.

255
00:20:25.976 --> 00:20:28.638
Well, it matters to me,
if that means anything.

256
00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:29.847
Erin, look, I-

257
00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:32.433
That girl has got parents
who's gonna want her back.

258
00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:36.771
Not just dumped on the side of the road
like a piece of trash.

259
00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:46.069
You see our Lone Ranger anywhere?

260
00:20:50.459 --> 00:20:52.871
Maybe this isn't the Crawford Mill.

261
00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:57.621
It's unbelievable.

262
00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:02.005
This is a joke. There's nobody here.

263
00:21:02.179 --> 00:21:04.386
There's no sheriff here.

264
00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:08.344
What?

265
00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:10.850
-I just saw something move.
-I just saw something.

266
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:13.058
I swear to God
I saw something move in there.

267
00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:15.814
-You're trying to scare me into leaving.
-Erin, come on.

268
00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:17.315
Go to hell.

269
00:21:17.486 --> 00:21:19.477
Erin, come on, quit screwing around.

270
00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:49.889
- Kemper!
- Erin.

271
00:21:50.894 --> 00:21:52.510
Erin.

272
00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:54.894
Erin, where are you?

273
00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:01.234
What's up, you?

274
00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:05.610
All right, you guys.

275
00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:08.241
- All right.
- Go.

276
00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:15.908
- I got it.
-Okay.

277
00:22:27.931 --> 00:22:29.547
Damn it. Give me--

278
00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:33.429
- Give me something to hold this shit.
- It's a possum.

279
00:22:33.603 --> 00:22:35.594
- Oh, dude, it's a possum.
- Indigenous to the--

280
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.101
You think this is a--?

281
00:22:39.568 --> 00:22:41.434
I didn't do that.

282
00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:50.404
All right, that's it.

283
00:22:50.579 --> 00:22:53.446
If somebody's out there,
just stop fucking around, all right?

284
00:22:53.874 --> 00:22:55.740
I mean it. Just come on out.

285
00:23:08.138 --> 00:23:09.674
Who are you?

286
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.767
What'd you do to her?

287
00:23:17.063 --> 00:23:18.303
Huh?

288
00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:22.308
The girl out there in the van.

289
00:23:23.278 --> 00:23:25.189
We didn't do anything to her.

290
00:23:25.363 --> 00:23:27.320
She did that to herself.

291
00:23:35.206 --> 00:23:36.822
Oh, my God.

292
00:23:40.045 --> 00:23:42.377
Promise you won't hurt me?

293
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.802
Hey, you make these?

294
00:24:04.569 --> 00:24:05.900
Hey, buddy.

295
00:24:06.071 --> 00:24:07.607
Hey.

296
00:24:07.781 --> 00:24:10.364
This is the old Crawford Mill, right?

297
00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:15.110
My name's Erin.

298
00:24:16.289 --> 00:24:18.030
Jedidiah.

299
00:24:23.838 --> 00:24:24.873
Yo, junior.

300
00:24:25.298 --> 00:24:29.007
So we're waiting here for the sheriff.
Do you know where he is?

301
00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.881
Okay, well, where?

302
00:24:33.098 --> 00:24:34.554
Home.

303
00:24:34.724 --> 00:24:36.055
Getting drunk.

304
00:24:36.226 --> 00:24:38.058
Cool. Let's split.

305
00:24:38.228 --> 00:24:41.721
If the sheriff doesn't give a shit,
then why should we?

306
00:24:42.565 --> 00:24:44.556
Does he live around here?

307
00:24:46.736 --> 00:24:49.979
You know,
front-row tickets to a big concert.

308
00:24:50.365 --> 00:24:52.072
Can we drive there from here?

309
00:24:52.867 --> 00:24:54.323
Road don't go there.

310
00:24:54.786 --> 00:24:55.821
Short walk though.

311
00:24:56.413 --> 00:24:59.997
I think we should go, like, now.
Like, right now.

312
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.917
How do I get to the sheriff's?

313
00:25:38.705 --> 00:25:40.946
Whoa. Hey, you sick little mutant.

314
00:25:44.377 --> 00:25:47.369
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on, now, let go. Get out of here.

315
00:25:47.547 --> 00:25:49.458
That's police evidence.

316
00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:27.834
Is anybody home?

317
00:26:29.005 --> 00:26:31.667
- Hello?
- What do you want?

318
00:26:32.175 --> 00:26:33.711
Are you the sheriff?

319
00:26:33.885 --> 00:26:36.593
Do I look like a sheriff?

320
00:26:36.763 --> 00:26:40.506
- I don't know, I can't see you.
- Stand back from the door.

321
00:26:49.484 --> 00:26:51.851
Sheriff don't live here.

322
00:26:52.362 --> 00:26:54.319
You can call him if you want to.

323
00:26:54.697 --> 00:26:57.189
Thanks, we'd really appreciate it.

324
00:26:59.369 --> 00:27:00.530
Wipe your feet.

325
00:27:01.204 --> 00:27:03.821
I like to keep a clean house.

326
00:27:09.087 --> 00:27:10.577
I said she could call him.

327
00:27:10.755 --> 00:27:13.213
-You wait outside.
-Okay, chief.

328
00:27:13.716 --> 00:27:16.378
- I ain't looking for trouble.
-Don't shoot.

329
00:27:17.554 --> 00:27:19.420
Terrible.

330
00:27:41.452 --> 00:27:43.693
I'll dial him for you.

331
00:28:05.185 --> 00:28:08.428
- Hello?
- Hi, is this the sheriff's office?

332
00:28:10.273 --> 00:28:11.604
Can I speak to him, please?

333
00:28:26.748 --> 00:28:27.909
Oh, thank God.

334
00:28:52.482 --> 00:28:54.314
It's just an educated guess...

335
00:28:54.484 --> 00:28:59.650
...but my money says
your dead body's right there in that van.

336
00:29:00.114 --> 00:29:03.232
Sheriff's gonna be there
in about 30 minutes.

337
00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:06.447
Thirty minutes?
Believe me, we will be there.

338
00:29:10.959 --> 00:29:12.666
Thanks. I'm all set.

339
00:29:14.629 --> 00:29:18.668
Wait, wait.
Can you help me out back here?

340
00:29:33.273 --> 00:29:34.809
Are you okay?

341
00:29:34.983 --> 00:29:37.645
-Could you just...?
-Okay.

342
00:29:49.205 --> 00:29:51.947
Excuse me. Erin?

343
00:29:53.084 --> 00:29:54.870
Excuse me.

344
00:30:06.347 --> 00:30:07.929
Erin?

345
00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:19.433
Excuse me, you mind
getting the fuck out of my way, son?

346
00:30:22.697 --> 00:30:26.156
We picked her up
on the side of the road, like...

347
00:30:26.326 --> 00:30:30.035
Wow. Look at that mess.

348
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:42.247
Who does this belong to?

349
00:30:44.093 --> 00:30:47.882
- She had that on her, sir.
- You don't say.

350
00:30:48.348 --> 00:30:51.932
-Had it on her?
-Yes, Sir.

351
00:31:01.319 --> 00:31:04.937
Okay, you can just relax,
because you're not helping.

352
00:31:10.745 --> 00:31:13.112
Good girl. Good girl.

353
00:31:19.837 --> 00:31:21.669
Pigsty.

354
00:31:38.064 --> 00:31:39.475
Oh, Jesus.

355
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.391
What the hell was that?

356
00:32:27.738 --> 00:32:29.445
Kemper?

357
00:32:30.408 --> 00:32:32.149
Kemp?

358
00:32:41.377 --> 00:32:44.210
Well, let's get her wrapped up.

359
00:32:51.888 --> 00:32:53.879
Oh, pretty little thing.

360
00:32:55.391 --> 00:32:57.553
How about giving me a hand here,
asshole?

361
00:32:59.562 --> 00:33:02.475
You don't expect me
to do this by myself?

362
00:33:03.024 --> 00:33:05.061
I need some help.

363
00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.062
Always getting yanked into this shit.
What am I doing?

364
00:33:10.239 --> 00:33:13.482
Lift her up and just kind of
pull her over your way there.

365
00:33:13.659 --> 00:33:16.242
She ain't gonna bite you.
She's deader than a doornail.

366
00:33:16.412 --> 00:33:20.121
-Get a hold of her and pick her up.
-Yes, sir.

367
00:33:23.085 --> 00:33:25.543
Yeah. There you go.

368
00:33:26.923 --> 00:33:28.334
I'll bet she's real unhappy.

369
00:33:28.508 --> 00:33:33.753
Real sorry that you're getting fucking
her blood all over your goddamn arm.

370
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:38.049
You know,
back when I was a young patrolman...

371
00:33:38.226 --> 00:33:40.467
...I used to love wrapping up
these young honeys.

372
00:33:40.645 --> 00:33:41.680
I'll bet you did.

373
00:33:41.854 --> 00:33:45.392
Cop me a little bit of a feel
every now and then, you know?

374
00:33:46.651 --> 00:33:47.891
Oh, shit.

375
00:33:48.611 --> 00:33:50.648
Look at that.
She's kind of wet down there.

376
00:33:50.821 --> 00:33:53.438
What you boys been doing
with this dead body, anyway?

377
00:33:53.616 --> 00:33:55.903
Can we please finish this?

378
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.207
Kemper?

379
00:34:06.921 --> 00:34:08.503
Kemp?

380
00:34:35.825 --> 00:34:36.986
Something wrong?

381
00:34:37.785 --> 00:34:40.322
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

382
00:34:40.871 --> 00:34:42.327
But he's not in my house.

383
00:34:43.624 --> 00:34:45.160
Thanks.

384
00:34:53.509 --> 00:34:54.590
Kemper?

385
00:34:58.806 --> 00:35:00.388
Kemp?

386
00:35:04.687 --> 00:35:06.724
Goddamn him.

387
00:35:07.732 --> 00:35:10.315
Okay, boys, there you go. There she is.

388
00:35:10.693 --> 00:35:12.354
Let's get her out of there now.

389
00:35:12.528 --> 00:35:14.360
You, four-eyes, get a hold of her legs.

390
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.522
-Get after that part of her.
-Push, go.

391
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.743
-Okay. Come on.
-Ow!

392
00:35:22.371 --> 00:35:23.532
Jesus.

393
00:35:23.706 --> 00:35:26.664
- This is ridiculous.
- We'll just stick her in the back seat.

394
00:35:27.543 --> 00:35:29.955
It just seems so wrong.

395
00:35:31.255 --> 00:35:33.792
Don't give me any crap, young lady.

396
00:35:33.966 --> 00:35:38.210
Goddamn it, I got just as much respect
for a dead body as anybody around here.

397
00:35:39.513 --> 00:35:45.179
Hey, get that nasty goddamn thing
out of the back seat of my goddamn car.

398
00:35:45.353 --> 00:35:48.596
Put it in the trunk.
What the hell's the matter with you?

399
00:35:50.024 --> 00:35:52.516
-Don't break my-- Don't break my stuff.
-Get the legs.

400
00:35:52.693 --> 00:35:54.354
Put the legs in.

401
00:36:02.119 --> 00:36:04.486
Y'all gonna be able
to find your way out of here?

402
00:36:04.664 --> 00:36:07.326
- Yeah. Yeah, we'll be fine.
- All right, then.

403
00:36:09.502 --> 00:36:12.790
Protect and serve. That's what we do.

404
00:36:12.963 --> 00:36:14.920
That you did, sir.

405
00:36:21.764 --> 00:36:23.471
Kemp.

406
00:36:31.524 --> 00:36:32.764
Kemper?

407
00:37:23.993 --> 00:37:25.825
Kemper.

408
00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:38.459
Poor Kemp. He ain't ever
gonna get the stink out of this van.

409
00:37:38.632 --> 00:37:41.215
You think we should we try to clean it
for him?

410
00:37:41.886 --> 00:37:43.718
Be my guest.

411
00:37:50.686 --> 00:37:52.472
Are you okay?

412
00:37:52.646 --> 00:37:54.307
It's too much. I'm gonna be sick.

413
00:37:54.482 --> 00:37:57.474
Okay, good news. Sheriff's on his way.

414
00:37:58.277 --> 00:38:00.234
Sheriff already came.

415
00:38:01.697 --> 00:38:03.153
He took the body.

416
00:38:04.533 --> 00:38:06.194
Where's Kemper?

417
00:38:06.368 --> 00:38:08.029
Wasn't he with you?

418
00:38:12.374 --> 00:38:15.708
- Kemper?
- What the hell is that?

419
00:38:16.545 --> 00:38:18.035
Come here.

420
00:38:19.965 --> 00:38:22.081
Kemper.

421
00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:25.335
Kemp.

422
00:38:38.943 --> 00:38:41.059
There's nobody even here.

423
00:38:43.656 --> 00:38:45.238
- Kemp.
- What was that all about?

424
00:38:48.077 --> 00:38:49.533
Kemper.

425
00:38:50.871 --> 00:38:51.986
What is that?

426
00:38:52.706 --> 00:38:55.573
-Oh, what the--?
-It's somebody's fucking teeth, isn't it?

427
00:38:55.751 --> 00:38:59.335
-Pepper, calm down, all right?
-Erin, find your boyfriend. It's time to go.

428
00:39:00.965 --> 00:39:02.831
Kemper.

429
00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:08.420
Kemp.

430
00:39:16.939 --> 00:39:18.600
Morgan, what are you doing?

431
00:39:23.112 --> 00:39:25.069
Oh, my God.

432
00:39:27.366 --> 00:39:29.778
- Pull him out.
- Oh, my God.

433
00:39:30.619 --> 00:39:32.280
- I can't.
- Oh, my God.

434
00:39:33.747 --> 00:39:35.863
- Asshole.
- It's not funny.

435
00:39:40.838 --> 00:39:43.580
Oh, what the hell is that?

436
00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.303
Is that the girl from our van?

437
00:39:51.015 --> 00:39:52.505
That's her.

438
00:39:56.103 --> 00:39:58.185
Is that her family?

439
00:40:00.691 --> 00:40:03.058
What were they all doing here?

440
00:40:04.153 --> 00:40:06.235
They were probably
looking for the sheriff.

441
00:40:07.615 --> 00:40:08.821
This is fucking weird.

442
00:40:10.576 --> 00:40:14.240
All right, you know what? Let's find Kemper
and get the hell out of here.

443
00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:18.994
Where are you going?

444
00:40:19.668 --> 00:40:21.250
To find him.

445
00:40:22.421 --> 00:40:24.458
Well, where are the keys for the van?

446
00:40:28.177 --> 00:40:30.339
Well, who put you in charge?

447
00:40:32.097 --> 00:40:33.963
If you guys wanna take off, that's fine.

448
00:40:34.141 --> 00:40:36.758
But I am not getting in that van
and leaving without him.

449
00:40:36.936 --> 00:40:39.974
-Give me the keys.
-Don't even think about it.

450
00:40:40.606 --> 00:40:42.017
Andy.

451
00:40:42.191 --> 00:40:46.185
I don't know about you guys, but I happen
to like my teeth right where they are.

452
00:40:46.862 --> 00:40:49.524
We can't leave him. Let's go.

453
00:40:50.115 --> 00:40:51.856
We'll meet you back at the van.

454
00:41:34.118 --> 00:41:36.735
- I know Kemp's in there.
- Wonderful.

455
00:41:36.912 --> 00:41:39.028
All right, keep him busy.

456
00:41:48.632 --> 00:41:51.750
Hi, it's me again.
I'm really sorry to bother you...

457
00:41:51.927 --> 00:41:54.259
...but I can't find my boyfriend,
Kemper, anywhere.

458
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:55.886
I thought I would just come and--

459
00:41:56.056 --> 00:41:58.093
Ain't you supposed to meet the sheriff?

460
00:42:11.905 --> 00:42:13.441
Kemper.

461
00:42:18.787 --> 00:42:20.949
Kemp, don't mess around.

462
00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.918
Wow, what a wonderful garden you have.

463
00:42:27.087 --> 00:42:30.751
It's just so plentiful.

464
00:43:33.612 --> 00:43:35.353
Andy?

465
00:43:35.697 --> 00:43:38.530
Hey, you can't just go in my house.

466
00:43:39.493 --> 00:43:41.200
Andy.

467
00:43:43.705 --> 00:43:45.537
Are you okay?

468
00:43:46.166 --> 00:43:47.873
Yeah.

469
00:43:52.047 --> 00:43:54.379
What the hell are you doing in my house?

470
00:43:56.885 --> 00:43:59.718
We're just looking for our friend,
then we'll be out of here.

471
00:44:00.139 --> 00:44:03.848
You ain't running things, boy,
except your mouth.

472
00:44:04.017 --> 00:44:05.553
He sounds crazy.

473
00:44:06.645 --> 00:44:08.386
You little turd.

474
00:44:08.564 --> 00:44:10.726
You're so dead, you don't even know it.

475
00:44:14.403 --> 00:44:17.316
Come on, boy. Bring it.

476
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:19.071
Bring it.

477
00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:21.528
-Bring what?
-Bring it.

478
00:44:26.582 --> 00:44:27.572
Oh, shit.

479
00:44:32.546 --> 00:44:33.877
Shit.

480
00:44:34.923 --> 00:44:36.038
Erin!

481
00:44:37.259 --> 00:44:39.250
-Come on.
-Andy.

482
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.011
Get the fuck out of here. Run.

483
00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:34.347
Shit! God!

484
00:45:55.337 --> 00:45:56.623
Please.

485
00:45:57.089 --> 00:45:58.500
Please. Stop.

486
00:45:58.674 --> 00:46:01.462
No, please. Please.

487
00:46:01.635 --> 00:46:02.670
Stop.

488
00:46:04.596 --> 00:46:07.839
Shit. Erin! Erin!

489
00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:09.385
Erin!

490
00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.023
Kemper really owes us for this.

491
00:46:23.448 --> 00:46:25.359
- What's wrong, Erin?
- Are you okay?

492
00:46:25.534 --> 00:46:26.524
Where's the gun?

493
00:46:27.911 --> 00:46:29.777
-Come on.
-Erin, what's going on?

494
00:46:29.955 --> 00:46:31.366
Where's the gun?

495
00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.531
The sheriff took it.

496
00:46:33.709 --> 00:46:35.040
Shit.

497
00:46:35.877 --> 00:46:37.788
Erin, what the fuck's going on?
Calm down.

498
00:46:37.963 --> 00:46:38.998
-Erin.
-Fuck.

499
00:46:39.172 --> 00:46:40.333
-What?
-What?

500
00:46:43.385 --> 00:46:45.467
- Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.
- Take it easy.

501
00:46:45.637 --> 00:46:47.219
-Thank God.
-Take it easy.

502
00:46:47.389 --> 00:46:48.675
My friend needs help.

503
00:46:48.849 --> 00:46:51.762
My friend, right now. My friend's dying.
My friend's being hurt.

504
00:46:51.935 --> 00:46:53.972
Settle down.
Take a couple of deep breaths.

505
00:46:54.146 --> 00:46:56.012
- There's some guy--
- Shh, shh.

506
00:46:56.898 --> 00:46:58.229
Just quiet down.

507
00:47:00.027 --> 00:47:01.734
-Please.
-What's wrong with your car?

508
00:47:01.903 --> 00:47:04.395
There's nothing wrong with my car.

509
00:47:04.573 --> 00:47:06.940
- Whoa.
- It's my friend.

510
00:47:07.326 --> 00:47:10.990
Please help him.
I don't know where he is anymore.

511
00:47:11.163 --> 00:47:13.200
Somebody wanna explain this?

512
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:19.665
-It's not mine, sir.
-You kids taking drugs?

513
00:47:20.047 --> 00:47:21.833
- No.
- No.

514
00:47:22.007 --> 00:47:23.918
It's not our van.

515
00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.672
I smell bullshit.

516
00:47:31.767 --> 00:47:32.882
No.

517
00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.892
-My friend--
-Get out of the van.

518
00:47:35.354 --> 00:47:36.389
Out.

519
00:47:40.484 --> 00:47:44.352
On your faces. All three of you.

520
00:47:45.947 --> 00:47:47.233
Get on the ground.

521
00:48:02.297 --> 00:48:04.083
No. No.

522
00:48:59.688 --> 00:49:01.599
Arizona.

523
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:03.931
Colorado.

524
00:49:05.235 --> 00:49:07.818
-New York.
-Please, you've gotta help him.

525
00:49:07.988 --> 00:49:10.605
There's a-- He's fucking killing him.

526
00:49:11.199 --> 00:49:13.315
- Now we're getting some place.
- Come on. Please.

527
00:49:13.493 --> 00:49:14.779
Who's killing who?

528
00:49:14.953 --> 00:49:17.786
There's a fucking guy
with a fucking chainsaw.

529
00:49:17.956 --> 00:49:23.827
Get your sweet little ass back in the dirt
until I say otherwise.

530
00:49:27.716 --> 00:49:29.002
You know what I think?

531
00:49:29.176 --> 00:49:33.545
I think your boyfriend shot that little girl
and then he ran off.

532
00:49:33.722 --> 00:49:36.339
He did not. Some fucking guy with a--

533
00:49:38.894 --> 00:49:41.852
-Stop, stop.
-We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die!

534
00:49:42.022 --> 00:49:45.890
You girls better get yourselves under
control or I'm gonna have to do it for you.

535
00:49:46.067 --> 00:49:47.978
Why won't you listen to her?

536
00:49:49.404 --> 00:49:50.815
Get on your feet.

537
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.355
Get over by the van.

538
00:49:53.742 --> 00:49:56.279
- Please, stop.
- We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

539
00:49:56.453 --> 00:49:57.818
We're gonna die, we're--

540
00:49:58.413 --> 00:50:01.576
I wanna know exactly
what happened inside that van.

541
00:50:02.959 --> 00:50:06.168
-We already told you what happened.
-And now you're gonna show me.

542
00:50:07.881 --> 00:50:09.246
Get in.

543
00:50:56.638 --> 00:50:58.379
Is that where she was sitting?

544
00:50:58.974 --> 00:51:03.889
Because the angle don't add up for me
with the blood on that back window.

545
00:51:13.697 --> 00:51:16.109
Maybe she was a bit more in the middle.

546
00:51:16.408 --> 00:51:20.902
Well, maybe you ought to move
a little more over to the middle.

547
00:51:21.746 --> 00:51:23.077
But...

548
00:51:25.458 --> 00:51:28.246
What, are you afraid of a little blood?

549
00:51:30.255 --> 00:51:32.917
Get the fuck over there!

550
00:51:39.639 --> 00:51:42.427
I don't have much of an imagination.

551
00:51:42.601 --> 00:51:47.016
So I need to get a distinct image...

552
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.471
...of what went down here.

553
00:51:49.983 --> 00:51:51.599
What'd she do next?

554
00:51:53.194 --> 00:51:54.559
She...

555
00:51:56.072 --> 00:51:59.531
-She shot herself.
-Oh, she shot herself.

556
00:51:59.993 --> 00:52:01.028
You don't say.

557
00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:04.578
-How?
-What do you mean, "how"?

558
00:52:07.334 --> 00:52:08.665
Take the gun.

559
00:52:09.419 --> 00:52:12.753
Take the gun
and show me how she did it.

560
00:52:12.922 --> 00:52:14.378
Come on.

561
00:52:14.716 --> 00:52:16.502
Take the gun.

562
00:52:16.676 --> 00:52:19.293
Take the gun and show me.

563
00:52:19.888 --> 00:52:21.219
Take the goddamn gun!

564
00:52:28.897 --> 00:52:30.353
Is that how she did it?

565
00:52:31.941 --> 00:52:33.147
Yes.

566
00:52:33.318 --> 00:52:35.184
-Yes, Sir.
-You're a fucking liar.

567
00:52:35.362 --> 00:52:38.900
There ain't no hole
in the bottom of her chin. I looked.

568
00:52:39.074 --> 00:52:45.411
She stuck the goddamn weapon
into her mouth, didn't she?

569
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.537
Show me how she did it.

570
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:52.246
-Please.
-Do it.

571
00:52:53.421 --> 00:52:54.957
Show me.

572
00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.256
Please, please, please.

573
00:52:58.426 --> 00:53:00.918
-Attaboy. There you go.
-Please, please, don't.

574
00:53:01.429 --> 00:53:03.591
And then what'd she do?

575
00:53:04.265 --> 00:53:05.755
She shot herself.

576
00:53:05.934 --> 00:53:08.266
-You ain't lying to me again, are you?
-No.

577
00:53:08.436 --> 00:53:11.895
Because I have never seen a weapon go off
without somebody's finger...

578
00:53:12.065 --> 00:53:13.772
...on the fucking trigger.

579
00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:16.271
Morgan, what's going on?

580
00:53:16.444 --> 00:53:17.434
You okay?

581
00:53:17.612 --> 00:53:20.070
You girls stay in the dirt
till I tell you different.

582
00:53:21.616 --> 00:53:24.950
You motherfucker.
Get on the fucking floor.

583
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:28.237
- I said, get on the floor!
-What the hell are you doing?

584
00:53:29.165 --> 00:53:31.953
- What are you gonna do, shoot me?
- Morgan, please, please.

585
00:53:32.127 --> 00:53:34.915
Just please put the gun down, okay?
Please don't do it.

586
00:53:35.088 --> 00:53:36.123
Oh, my God, Morgan.

587
00:53:36.297 --> 00:53:39.255
-You lying fuck.
-You could kill me right now.

588
00:53:39.426 --> 00:53:41.463
Get out of here scot-free, couldn't you?

589
00:53:41.636 --> 00:53:43.968
Morgan, please. Just put it down.

590
00:53:44.139 --> 00:53:46.972
He shoots me,
you're accomplice to murder.

591
00:53:48.059 --> 00:53:49.845
- Morgan, please.
- You two...

592
00:53:50.019 --> 00:53:52.101
-...you're just as guilty as him.
-Please. Come on.

593
00:53:52.272 --> 00:53:55.890
-Morgan!
-Do it! Fucking shoot him!

594
00:53:56.484 --> 00:53:58.646
- You put the gun down.
- Morgan, shoot him.

595
00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:02.484
-Don't fucking do it, please.
-You don't have the fucking balls, do you?

596
00:54:02.657 --> 00:54:05.570
- Morgan, don't shoot him!
- Shoot him, shoot him!

597
00:54:05.744 --> 00:54:07.075
Pull the fucking trigger!

598
00:54:07.704 --> 00:54:08.910
Fuck you.

599
00:54:13.418 --> 00:54:16.331
Well, well, well. Lookie here.

600
00:54:17.005 --> 00:54:19.918
-Oh, my God, Morgan.
-We got ourselves a killer.

601
00:54:20.341 --> 00:54:24.460
Only this time, you killed a sheriff.

602
00:54:30.059 --> 00:54:33.927
I ought to blow your fucking brains out
right now, asshole.

603
00:54:34.355 --> 00:54:37.438
Get out of the van. Get out.

604
00:54:38.067 --> 00:54:39.978
Get out of the van.

605
00:54:41.863 --> 00:54:43.649
Morgan.

606
00:54:45.867 --> 00:54:49.110
Where are you taking him?
What are you doing?

607
00:54:49.287 --> 00:54:53.121
- Why are you taking the keys?
- Get the fuck away from me.

608
00:55:46.553 --> 00:55:47.759
Man, this is bullshit.

609
00:55:53.977 --> 00:55:55.888
I have rights.

610
00:55:57.564 --> 00:55:59.350
Yeah, you got rights. Okay.

611
00:56:01.025 --> 00:56:03.062
Where were y'all headed?

612
00:56:03.236 --> 00:56:04.897
Dallas.

613
00:56:05.572 --> 00:56:06.937
Skynyrd concert.

614
00:56:07.615 --> 00:56:10.778
Skynyrd? Hell, I like Skynyrd.

615
00:56:11.619 --> 00:56:15.783
By God, how about that?
We got something in common, don't we?

616
00:56:16.457 --> 00:56:20.416
Well, what are you gonna do
with your tickets now, hotshot?

617
00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.507
You can have them.

618
00:56:27.677 --> 00:56:29.634
Is that bribery?

619
00:56:34.475 --> 00:56:37.968
Oh, that was really rude, wasn't it?

620
00:56:39.564 --> 00:56:41.976
Oh, look at you.

621
00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:45.983
How about that?

622
00:56:49.616 --> 00:56:53.610
Look at that shit.
We got something else in common now.

623
00:56:55.163 --> 00:56:56.745
See that?

624
00:57:04.839 --> 00:57:07.831
Get on over to the damn Crawford Mill.

625
00:57:08.009 --> 00:57:09.966
Those two fillies are good to go.

626
00:57:18.227 --> 00:57:20.594
-Shit.
-What do you think he's doing to Morgan?

627
00:57:20.772 --> 00:57:23.389
I don't wanna think about it, okay?

628
00:57:29.697 --> 00:57:31.438
Oh, shit.

629
00:57:32.283 --> 00:57:36.242
Pepper, I need you to hold that light
really steady.

630
00:57:36.412 --> 00:57:37.652
Can you do that?

631
00:57:48.883 --> 00:57:51.625
-Where did you learn how to do that?
-In juvie.

632
00:57:51.803 --> 00:57:54.010
They called my youth misspent.

633
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.841
Oh, thank God.

634
00:58:15.576 --> 00:58:17.533
-Get out of the car.
-Where are we?

635
00:58:17.704 --> 00:58:19.991
It's none of your goddamn business,
faggot.

636
00:58:20.164 --> 00:58:22.656
Just get out of the goddamn car.

637
00:58:31.092 --> 00:58:33.550
You kids shouldn't have messed
with that little girl.

638
00:58:37.181 --> 00:58:39.297
You brought this all on yourself.

639
00:58:39.475 --> 00:58:42.558
Now get the hell in the house.

640
00:58:45.064 --> 00:58:47.396
-Come on, please.
-Come on.

641
00:58:50.486 --> 00:58:52.102
-Come on, please.
-Come on, Erin, come on.

642
00:58:53.781 --> 00:58:54.771
-Yes.
-Yes.

643
00:58:58.619 --> 00:59:00.610
Go, go, go.

644
00:59:16.512 --> 00:59:18.469
Go! Go!

645
00:59:52.507 --> 00:59:54.248
Get out, Pepper, now.

646
01:00:04.185 --> 01:00:05.767
Pepper.

647
01:00:10.108 --> 01:00:11.519
Run.

648
01:00:16.823 --> 01:00:19.656
No! No, Pepper.

649
01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.493
Please, please. Please, let me in.

650
01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:11.749
Please. Help me, please.

651
01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.026
Why don't you have a seat?

652
01:01:40.114 --> 01:01:41.525
It's okay. Sit down.

653
01:01:42.909 --> 01:01:44.365
Have a seat.

654
01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:47.778
Turn that thing off.
He's gonna fucking hear it.

655
01:02:00.426 --> 01:02:02.884
There's nothing a good old cup of tea
won't settle.

656
01:02:05.473 --> 01:02:08.807
Nobody's gonna come through that door.

657
01:02:10.603 --> 01:02:12.310
I really need to use your phone.

658
01:02:13.314 --> 01:02:14.429
I don't have one.

659
01:02:15.191 --> 01:02:16.602
No.

660
01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:20.109
Phones are a hassle.

661
01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:23.487
No. Don't you get it?

662
01:02:23.658 --> 01:02:26.150
He's gonna kill you.
He's gonna kill all of us.

663
01:02:26.953 --> 01:02:31.322
-Oh, no, he won't.
-Yes, he will.

664
01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:35.743
He knows better
than to be messing around here.

665
01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:42.086
Everyone around here
knows that poor, sweet boy.

666
01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:43.500
Sweet boy.

667
01:02:43.928 --> 01:02:45.839
He's no harm.

668
01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:48.505
He always keeps to himself.

669
01:02:50.017 --> 01:02:52.475
Skin disease.

670
01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:56.513
He was just a little boy when it started.

671
01:02:56.691 --> 01:02:59.103
Didn't you look at his face?

672
01:03:01.195 --> 01:03:03.311
I couldn't. I couldn't look.

673
01:03:03.489 --> 01:03:06.072
Oh, sweetie.

674
01:03:06.242 --> 01:03:07.824
Here.

675
01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:11.194
Here, it's just right.

676
01:03:11.872 --> 01:03:15.206
Come drink some before it gets cold.

677
01:03:15.376 --> 01:03:17.788
You have no idea.

678
01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:23.214
-Hush, now.
-I don't wanna drink any more tea.

679
01:03:23.384 --> 01:03:24.465
I just need a phone.

680
01:03:26.012 --> 01:03:28.049
-Please.
-Now see what you've done?

681
01:03:30.558 --> 01:03:32.094
Oh. Heh-heh.

682
01:03:32.268 --> 01:03:34.054
That wasn't a good idea.

683
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:43.355
Now drink up your tea.

684
01:03:43.946 --> 01:03:45.653
It'll help you relax.

685
01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:48.064
I'll be right back.

686
01:03:53.581 --> 01:03:56.164
You're a little tense.

687
01:03:56.459 --> 01:03:57.824
You should relax.

688
01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:43.415
I better go now.

689
01:04:47.218 --> 01:04:50.802
You okay, child? You don't look so good.

690
01:04:53.015 --> 01:04:55.928
I thought you said
you didn't have a have a phone.

691
01:04:57.061 --> 01:05:00.304
It's okay. It's okay.

692
01:05:03.651 --> 01:05:05.892
That's not your baby.

693
01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.272
You stole her!

694
01:05:12.827 --> 01:05:15.319
She's mine.

695
01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:38.342
Oh, my.

696
01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:40.135
Oh, my, my, my.

697
01:05:40.312 --> 01:05:43.304
Everything's gonna be fine real soon.

698
01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:45.810
I promise.

699
01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:03.370
Give her some room.

700
01:06:04.545 --> 01:06:06.957
Maybe she'd like to stay for supper.

701
01:06:07.673 --> 01:06:10.381
Messed up everything already.
Stop bothering her.

702
01:06:10.551 --> 01:06:12.713
Grandma. Let me in now.

703
01:06:12.887 --> 01:06:18.553
You best stay out there with them dogs
till you learn how to play by the rules.

704
01:06:18.726 --> 01:06:22.515
You're not going nowhere, honey.

705
01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:28.395
Please. Please, just let me go.

706
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:30.901
I know your kind.

707
01:06:31.739 --> 01:06:35.232
Nothing but cruelty and ridicule
for my boy...

708
01:06:35.409 --> 01:06:38.618
...all the time he was growing up.

709
01:06:41.582 --> 01:06:44.916
Does anybody care
about me and my boy?

710
01:06:46.754 --> 01:06:49.086
- Huh?
- Don't hurt her.

711
01:06:49.256 --> 01:06:51.714
-Please, Grandma, don't--
-You shut up out there.

712
01:06:51.884 --> 01:06:55.297
Help me!
Please, will you make them stop?

713
01:06:55.471 --> 01:06:58.589
- Lookie, Mama, she likes me.
- Stop!

714
01:06:58.933 --> 01:07:02.426
What's wrong with you fucking people?

715
01:07:02.603 --> 01:07:04.435
Nothing wrong with us.

716
01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:07.226
- Tommy.
- Help me, please.

717
01:07:07.399 --> 01:07:11.518
Thomas Brown Hewitt,
you get in here right now.

718
01:07:13.906 --> 01:07:15.112
No!

719
01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:17.398
- No!
- Get her out of my sight.

720
01:07:17.576 --> 01:07:19.442
No, please, no. Please.

721
01:07:21.288 --> 01:07:22.323
Please.

722
01:07:22.498 --> 01:07:25.286
- Will you cut out that racket?
- No! No!

723
01:07:25.459 --> 01:07:27.075
No!

724
01:07:27.253 --> 01:07:29.039
Here's your pants.

725
01:07:29.338 --> 01:07:31.625
Thank you, Mama.

726
01:07:33.801 --> 01:07:35.633
No.

727
01:08:14.508 --> 01:08:16.499
Oh, my God.

728
01:08:57.092 --> 01:08:58.548
Erin.

729
01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:01.047
I can't...

730
01:09:01.597 --> 01:09:02.632
Erin, no. No.

731
01:09:02.806 --> 01:09:04.717
- Okay.
- No.

732
01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:07.892
Lift your body.

733
01:09:08.062 --> 01:09:10.053
Lift your body up.

734
01:09:10.397 --> 01:09:12.729
- Stop!
- Push.

735
01:09:16.737 --> 01:09:18.728
Stop!

736
01:09:20.741 --> 01:09:23.574
Lift your-- Lift your body.

737
01:09:32.878 --> 01:09:34.414
Sorry.

738
01:09:37.549 --> 01:09:39.711
Erin, please.

739
01:09:40.344 --> 01:09:43.086
Please, finish it.

740
01:09:44.723 --> 01:09:46.179
Erin, do it.

741
01:09:47.434 --> 01:09:48.924
I can't.

742
01:09:50.938 --> 01:09:52.269
I can't.

743
01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:54.555
-I can't.
-There's a knife.

744
01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:27.551
Erin.

745
01:10:31.478 --> 01:10:32.968
Erin.

746
01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:37.397
Do it. Do it.

747
01:10:39.153 --> 01:10:41.736
-I can't.
-Do it.

748
01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:43.566
I can't do it.

749
01:10:44.867 --> 01:10:46.357
Do it.

750
01:10:54.418 --> 01:10:56.329
Do it. Do it.

751
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:17.021
Please forgive me.

752
01:11:21.612 --> 01:11:23.853
Please forgive me.

753
01:12:12.037 --> 01:12:13.243
Morgan, it's me.

754
01:12:15.249 --> 01:12:16.910
No!

755
01:12:17.084 --> 01:12:21.078
Morgan, it's Erin.
Morgan, it's me. It's Erin.

756
01:12:21.255 --> 01:12:23.212
It's Erin. Come on.

757
01:12:32.891 --> 01:12:35.098
- Come on. Over here.
- Okay.

758
01:12:36.103 --> 01:12:37.514
We gotta go.

759
01:12:39.773 --> 01:12:41.263
Come on, now.

760
01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:43.398
- Now.
- Okay, Morgan.

761
01:12:43.569 --> 01:12:45.936
Come on. Morgan, get up.

762
01:12:48.949 --> 01:12:52.112
- Over here.
- Let's go. Walk.

763
01:12:52.286 --> 01:12:54.118
I need you to lean on me.

764
01:13:04.923 --> 01:13:07.585
Run. Faster.

765
01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:09.625
- Hurry. Come on.
- Keep going, keep going.

766
01:13:15.642 --> 01:13:17.098
- Run, fast.
- Run.

767
01:13:17.269 --> 01:13:18.976
Run, Morgan.

768
01:13:19.146 --> 01:13:21.934
- Come on.

769
01:13:28.405 --> 01:13:30.112
- Hurry.

770
01:13:30.282 --> 01:13:31.488
Hurry.

771
01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:35.659
Come on. Don't let him get you.
Come on.

772
01:13:35.829 --> 01:13:37.445
- Come on, Morgan.
- Get up there.

773
01:13:45.213 --> 01:13:47.124
-Come on.
-Go, go, go.

774
01:14:14.242 --> 01:14:17.451
Come on, Morgan. Come on.

775
01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:02.162
Morgan, the couch.

776
01:15:02.624 --> 01:15:04.240
The couch.

777
01:15:28.608 --> 01:15:30.224
Come on.

778
01:15:31.278 --> 01:15:32.814
Quick.

779
01:15:32.988 --> 01:15:34.695
Shit.

780
01:15:36.616 --> 01:15:38.106
Come on.

781
01:15:40.287 --> 01:15:41.743
Shit.

782
01:15:58.764 --> 01:16:00.129
Come on.

783
01:17:48.456 --> 01:17:51.289
No! No!

784
01:18:04.055 --> 01:18:05.261
Run! Run!

785
01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.431
Erin.

786
01:18:11.396 --> 01:18:12.932
Morgan!

787
01:18:21.156 --> 01:18:22.692
Get off him!

788
01:18:22.866 --> 01:18:24.948
Get off him!

789
01:19:33.687 --> 01:19:35.553
No. Stop.

790
01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:37.346
Stop. Please.

791
01:19:38.817 --> 01:19:40.399
Stop.

792
01:19:40.568 --> 01:19:42.275
Help me. Please.

793
01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:44.106
Please, I need help.

794
01:19:44.281 --> 01:19:45.692
Help. Help.

795
01:19:46.199 --> 01:19:48.065
Let me in.

796
01:20:02.465 --> 01:20:03.500
Oh, my God.

797
01:23:49.442 --> 01:23:50.432
Hey!

798
01:23:54.572 --> 01:23:56.609
Hey!

799
01:25:41.262 --> 01:25:43.378
Goddamn it.

800
01:25:43.723 --> 01:25:45.714
Come on.

801
01:26:02.992 --> 01:26:04.153
Stop!

802
01:26:04.619 --> 01:26:05.859
Stop!

803
01:26:06.037 --> 01:26:08.404
Please, stop!

804
01:26:20.218 --> 01:26:23.586
Hey there. You all right?

805
01:26:24.722 --> 01:26:26.588
Are you okay?

806
01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:31.560
Here. Come on,
let's get in my truck over here.

807
01:26:44.617 --> 01:26:46.608
You in a car wreck?

808
01:26:49.497 --> 01:26:51.283
Where are we going?

809
01:26:52.083 --> 01:26:54.290
I'm gonna get you some help.

810
01:26:54.627 --> 01:26:56.584
Honey, what's your name?

811
01:27:00.717 --> 01:27:02.458
Huh?

812
01:27:03.094 --> 01:27:05.586
I just wanna go home.

813
01:27:06.013 --> 01:27:07.549
You live around here?

814
01:27:09.726 --> 01:27:11.216
No.

815
01:27:15.773 --> 01:27:17.263
No. No.

816
01:27:17.859 --> 01:27:19.395
-No.
-Hey.

817
01:27:19.944 --> 01:27:22.561
-I can't go back there.
-Get off of me.

818
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:27.108
-Keep going.
-Stop it.

819
01:27:29.704 --> 01:27:31.615
No. Keep going.

820
01:27:36.461 --> 01:27:38.668
-What the hell--?
-Please, don't stop.

821
01:27:43.301 --> 01:27:46.510
I don't know what your problem is,
but I can't take this.

822
01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:49.922
Don't get out. Don't get out!

823
01:28:14.457 --> 01:28:16.619
Hello in there. Hello. Help.

824
01:28:16.793 --> 01:28:19.285
- Ma'am, help. I need some help out here.
- What is it?

825
01:28:19.462 --> 01:28:21.203
- What do you want?
- I picked up a girl.

826
01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.997
She's bloody. She's out here in my truck.

827
01:28:24.467 --> 01:28:27.835
Junior. Junior, come on out here.

828
01:28:30.932 --> 01:28:32.514
Come on.

829
01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:36.100
Henrietta, get me my raincoat.

830
01:28:37.855 --> 01:28:40.017
I need some help out here. Let's see.

831
01:28:40.191 --> 01:28:41.852
Henrietta?

832
01:28:42.026 --> 01:28:43.312
I gave her a ride.

833
01:28:43.486 --> 01:28:45.568
I found her
right down the highway.

834
01:28:45.738 --> 01:28:47.445
I don't know her name.

835
01:28:48.574 --> 01:28:53.159
Yeah. Well, she grabbed the steering wheel
and dang near ran me off the road.

836
01:28:53.329 --> 01:28:56.663
She nearly caused us to crash.
Yeah, she grabbed it while I was driving.

837
01:28:57.959 --> 01:29:01.577
She's out there.
She's out there in the truck.

838
01:29:12.431 --> 01:29:14.297
Well, I think she's there.

839
01:29:14.475 --> 01:29:16.432
She's out there in the truck.

840
01:29:16.602 --> 01:29:18.184
The baby's gone.

841
01:29:29.323 --> 01:29:31.064
Come on, come on.

842
01:29:31.242 --> 01:29:32.698
Come on.

843
01:29:36.539 --> 01:29:38.075
Come on.

844
01:29:59.478 --> 01:30:01.810
Come on, you little bitch, start.

845
01:30:15.661 --> 01:30:17.151
Fuck you!

846
01:30:51.405 --> 01:30:53.567
You asshole!

847
01:31:44.417 --> 01:31:46.704
This is August 20th, 1973.

848
01:31:46.877 --> 01:31:49.209
Location is the Hewitt residence.

849
01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:52.247
We're gonna go move
into the actual furnace room.

850
01:31:52.425 --> 01:31:53.915
Watch yourself.

851
01:31:54.677 --> 01:31:56.167
Look out.

852
01:31:56.345 --> 01:31:59.679
Oh, man. Ugh.

853
01:31:59.849 --> 01:32:02.682
Look out. You got it?

854
01:32:03.436 --> 01:32:04.471
All right.

855
01:32:04.645 --> 01:32:08.684
This is the actual furnace room
we're going into...

856
01:32:08.858 --> 01:32:12.317
...where they expected to perpetrated--

857
01:32:12.486 --> 01:32:14.773
Got a bit of a jump there.

858
01:32:15.281 --> 01:32:18.023
- Got it?
- That's okay. Don't worry.

859
01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:20.487
Come on back here. Follow me.

860
01:32:30.755 --> 01:32:34.589
The crime scene was not
properly secured by Travis County police.

861
01:32:34.759 --> 01:32:37.842
Two investigating officers
were fatally wounded that day.

862
01:32:39.138 --> 01:32:42.051
This is the only known image
of Thomas Hewitt...

863
01:32:42.224 --> 01:32:45.307
...the man they call Leatherface.

864
01:32:45.811 --> 01:32:48.052
The case today still remains open.
