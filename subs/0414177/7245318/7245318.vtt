00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:07.139
Well, future failures
of America,

3
00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.808
I hope you're all prepared
for tomorrow's big science fair.

4
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:11.743
This year's theme is...

5
00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.046
transportation.

6
00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.914
I am ready with my project,

7
00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.617
my solar-powered
audiovisual cart.

8
00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:22.054
I can go from zero to geek
in 2.6 seconds.

9
00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:26.758
Look at me,
I am working the machine!

10
00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.727
I'm ready with
my laser-powered boil lancer

11
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.133
because nobody should have
to travel with an unlanced boil.

12
00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:35.667
I ripped off--
I mean, invented--

13
00:00:36.337 --> 00:00:38.170
this high-tech robot decoy.

14
00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:39.571
That way, when the cops come

15
00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.874
the robot will travel
to jail instead of me.

16
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.643
MECHANICAL VOICE:
I didn't do it.

17
00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.378
I didn't do it.

18
00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:50.149
And I'm ready with my totally
souped-up mobile home

19
00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:51.850
because they can't take
your home from you

20
00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:53.419
if it's on the moon.

21
00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:54.520
Yee-hah!

22
00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:57.789
I'm ready...
and so are my clones

23
00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.192
because no one
should have to travel alone.

24
00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:04.129
Why didn't I finish my project?!

25
00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:05.164
<i>Why!</i>

26

Timmy, shouldn't you
be working

28
00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:13.439
on your travel-related
science fair project?

29
00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:14.906
This<i> is</i> my travel-related

32

35

About travel.

36
00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:30.655
Oh, right.

37
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:31.923
Not ready, eh, Turner?

38
00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.725
The only way you could
even hope to be ready

39
00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:35.694
is if you received
help from...

40
00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:38.130

41
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.232
I'm watching you,
Turner.

42
00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.667
Uh, look,

43
00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:43.902

44
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:49.408
Hey, there's
no child in pain here.

45
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.577

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:03.054
Cosmo, Wanda, you guys
got to get out of here

48
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.323
before Crocker sees you!

49
00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:06.325
Okay, but keep
your Auto Poofer with you.

50
00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:09.928
Once we leave,
just push the little star

51
00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.431
and you'll automatically
be poofed back to your room.

52
00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:16.835
Cool. Since I need to finish
my science fair project fast

53
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.539

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.436
Another experiment
must have gone
horribly wrong!

183
00:07:51.472 --> 00:07:53.872
This time he shrunk
his own head!

184
00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:56.240
My name's not Jimmy,
it's Timmy.

185
00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:58.577
Oh, you
scientifically altered

186
00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:00.679
the first letter
of your name?

187
00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:01.646
Huh?

188
00:08:01.682 --> 00:08:03.715
You maniacal genius!

189
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.817
Hey, I'll let
you two hang out

190
00:08:05.853 --> 00:08:08.653
if you show me
how to work this stuff.

191
00:08:13.494 --> 00:08:15.393
(<i> explosion</i> )

192
00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:16.094
We could do that.

193
00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:17.596
Sheen, no.

194
00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:18.763
Big-headed Jimmy said

195
00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:20.532
we should never
touch his stuff.

196
00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:23.568
Quiet, Carl,
the small-headed are
easily manipulated.

197
00:08:23.604 --> 00:08:24.936
This could be
our chance

198
00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.004
to play with some
of the coolest,

199
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.874
slightly more
dangerous experiments.

200
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:32.811
That I could use to win first
prize in the science fair!

201
00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.046
Let's get experimental.

202
00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:37.616
I love this new
small-headed Jimmy.

203
00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:42.921
Oh, yeah, I'm bad.

204
00:08:42.956 --> 00:08:44.890
I'm in the robo-walker.

205
00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:48.994
I feel nauseous,
but I'm bad... bad!

206
00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:51.329
Huzzah!

207
00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.498
Let evildoers beware

208
00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:55.133
the wrath of
Guy-in-a-bubbleman!

209
00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:58.837
Hey, where'd
Small-Headed Jimmy go?

210
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:02.473
(<i> yelling</i> )

211
00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:07.378
(<i> coughing</i> )

212
00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:11.416
Small-Headed Jimmy,
are you okay?

213
00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:13.752
My new bulgy skull
might be cracked,

214
00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:15.620
but my new bulgy mind
doesn't care!

215
00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:18.089
Let's do it again!

216
00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:19.090
Wow, this
new Jimmy puts

217
00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:21.526
the "mental"
in "experimental"!

218
00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.029
James Isaac Neutron!

219
00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.163
Look at this mess.

220
00:09:25.198 --> 00:09:26.230
Honestly, Jimmy...

221
00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:27.365
My name is Timmy!

222
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.499
Timmy!

223
00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:29.968
I think people
in your dimension

224
00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:32.170
use "J" instead
of a "T."

225
00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:34.405
Gee, what a jwit.

226
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.207
Oh, so now we're
a Mr. Smartymouth.

227
00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.543
Well, that's it, young man,
you're grounded!

228
00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:40.144
What'd I do?!

229
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.047
Hmm, might I suggest
a hypno-beam?

230
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.815
Ooh, excellent choice.

231
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.850
JUDY:
Didn't you hear me?

232
00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:47.852
I said you're...

233
00:09:47.888 --> 00:09:51.389
I can bend others
to my will-- cool!

234
00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.893
You think
that you're,
um, Mighty Mom!

235
00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.360
Quickly
spinning around,

236
00:09:56.396 --> 00:09:58.897
Judy Neutron transforms
herself into...

237
00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.632
Mighty Mom!

238
00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:02.366
Super-powered defender
of domestic order!

239
00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:05.203
My hyper-domestic senses
detect dirt

240
00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:06.972
and danger and dirt.

241
00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:09.774
Vacuum-powered flying
abilities, activate!

242
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.942
Whoosh!

243
00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:12.477
(<i> crash</i> )

244
00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:13.979
I'll clean that up.

245
00:10:14.014 --> 00:10:15.680
Uh, I don't know,
new Jimmy,

246
00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:16.915
maybe this stuff
<i>is</i> too dangerous.

247
00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.118
Aren't you worried
that we're tampering

248
00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:22.621
with forces we can
never hope to control?

249
00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:24.322
Don't you mean
"jampering"?

250
00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:25.456
And no, I'm not.

251
00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:27.025
So, about
this skateboard...

252
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.494
I think I'm finally
getting the hang of it.

253
00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:31.129
(<i> screams</i> )

254
00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:33.865
Wow, look at
Small-Headed Jimmy go!

255
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.299
Yeah!

256
00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:36.434
His lack of concern

257
00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.503
for the safety
of himself and others

258
00:10:38.538 --> 00:10:39.370
is bold and refreshing.

259
00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.741
Dust bunnies, surrender!

260
00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:45.043
(<i> struggling</i> )

261
00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:46.544
HUGH:
Yeah, Butterbiscuit,
I can't tell,

262
00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.480
is this a mole
or just a scaly patch?

263
00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:52.283
Why, it's
my faithful sidekick, Lintboy.

264
00:10:53.787 --> 00:10:55.153
It's "Lintman."

265
00:10:55.188 --> 00:10:56.888
Into your Spandex leotards,
Lintboy.

266
00:10:57.724 --> 00:11:00.491
We've got to scour
this town of evil.

267
00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:02.160
"Spandex..." I get it.

268
00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:04.696
You want to play one of
those special games, eh?

269
00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:06.931
All right, but let me
chase you this time.

270
00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:09.668
Behind the refrigerator
and beyond!

271
00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.235
Whoosh!

272
00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:13.538
All right, I'm coming
right behind you,

273
00:11:13.573 --> 00:11:14.773
my mistress of meticulousness.

274
00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:17.275
Look at me, I'm flying!

275
00:11:35.062 --> 00:11:36.627
CINDY:
I'm telling you,

276
00:11:36.663 --> 00:11:40.065
Susan B. Anthony
could totally kick
Madame Curie's butt.

277
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.034
Not if she
was tag-teamed
with Harriet Tubman.

278
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.436
Incoming!

279
00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:48.239
That could have
gone better.

280
00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:48.840
Neutron, you dolt!

281
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.710
Why don't you look
where you're flying?

282
00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:52.811
That's not Neutron--

283
00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:54.145
the head's too small.

284
00:11:54.181 --> 00:11:55.914
And that overbite
could crack open

285
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:56.915
a sea turtle.
Hey!

286
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:57.582
Let me guess,
you must be

287
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.252
one of Neutron's
online, 3-D chess club pals.

288
00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:03.454
Gr-eat, just
what this town needs--

289
00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:04.789
another big-brained
chess geek.

290
00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:07.391
Look, I said I was sorry!

291
00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:09.027
Too late,
Pawn-to-king-duh!

292
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.628
It wasn't my fault.

293
00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:12.263
The controls are
very complicated.

294
00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:13.832
Maybe to a hamster.

295
00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:16.201
Looks like all
you have to do

296
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.368
is press the studs.

297
00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:18.436
Really?

298
00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:19.871
Whoo-hoo, look at me!

299
00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.572
I'm doing it...

300
00:12:21.608 --> 00:12:23.441
and not crashing into stuff.

301
00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:25.509
Although, I kind of miss
the crashing into stuff.

302
00:12:26.146 --> 00:12:27.712
Hey, you're pretty smart.

303
00:12:28.615 --> 00:12:30.915
Want to help me with
my science project?

304
00:12:30.951 --> 00:12:32.784
You're asking
for a girl's help?

305
00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:34.518
You actually value
my opinion?

306
00:12:34.554 --> 00:12:34.986
Sort of.

307
00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:37.588
Careful, Cindy,
it's a trick.

308
00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:39.323
I'll bet Neutron
put him up to it.

309
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.927
No... I think
he actually means it.

310
00:12:42.963 --> 00:12:45.997
Looking good,
Small-Headed Jimmy.

311
00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:48.366
Cindy, Libby,
have you met

312
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:50.601
new Small-Headed Jimmy?

313
00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:52.804
You can call him
"new Jimmy" for short.

314
00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:54.305
This isn't Jimmy.

315
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:54.939
This is one of his friends--

316
00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:59.577
one of his much cooler,
better-looking friends.

317
00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.212
I love this universe!

318
00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:01.780
Are you mad, woman?

319
00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:03.347
Look at his head!

320
00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:04.883
Tell her,
Small-Headed Jimmy.

321
00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:07.318
Tell her how you shrunk
your own living head!

322
00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:09.988
Uh, I'm going to go
with what she said.

323
00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:13.191
What's the most challenging
part of 3-D chess?

324
00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.659
Uh, trying
to remember

325
00:13:14.694 --> 00:13:16.527
how that horsie
thing goes?

326
00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:18.296
CINDY (<i> giggling</i> ):
You're so funny!

327
00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:20.865
Hey, Jimmy,
where are you going?

328
00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:22.834
I think we've
just been flat left.

329
00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:23.902
Oh, man!

330
00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:26.437
I hate new Small-Headed Jimmy!

331
00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:38.716
(<i> mechanical roar</i> )

332
00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.585
(<i> camera whirring</i> )

333
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:46.224
JUDY:
Lintboy, quick!

334
00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:47.792
To the Mom Lair!

335
00:13:47.828 --> 00:13:49.393
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Now you're talking.

336
00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:50.028
Hey!

337
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.496
(<i> servos whirring</i> )

338
00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:54.332
(<i> Hugh grunting</i> )

339
00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:55.834
Hey, Mighty Mom!

340
00:13:55.869 --> 00:13:57.768
Household Avenger, open up!

341
00:13:57.804 --> 00:14:00.504
Lintboy needs to recharge
his power pack.

342
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.707
(<i> Goddard growling</i> )

343
00:14:02.742 --> 00:14:03.975
Goddard?

344
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.611
Player One, your future
is canceled.

345
00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:09.080
Down boy, no...

346
00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:11.382
No, down... down!

347
00:14:13.453 --> 00:14:14.853
Puking plutonium!

348
00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:16.487
My hands.

349
00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:19.090
My arms.

350
00:14:20.727 --> 00:14:21.759
My depth!

351
00:14:22.128 --> 00:14:23.828
It's gone!

352
00:14:23.864 --> 00:14:25.596
Where... where am I?

353
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:27.665
That bucktooth kid
must've used this

354
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.500
to teleport me
out of my own lab.

355
00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:31.336
I've got to get back to Goddard!

356
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:32.536
If I'm not there
to monitor his tune-up,

357
00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:34.572
the atomic transmutation
could run wild!

358
00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.775
There's got to be some sort
of instruction manual

359
00:14:38.578 --> 00:14:40.678
to this teleportation pen
in here.

360
00:14:42.249 --> 00:14:43.214
No manual.

361
00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:44.749
No fish.

362
00:14:48.488 --> 00:14:49.520
(<i> screams</i> )

363
00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:51.655
No... Hmm...

364
00:14:52.192 --> 00:14:54.092
Maybe under the bed.

365
00:14:57.931 --> 00:14:59.497
BOTH:
Aloha, Timmy!

366
00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:00.331
Timmy? Who's Timmy?

367
00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:02.833
I'm Jimmy-- Jimmy Neutron.

368
00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:05.803
(<i> screaming</i> )

369
00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:07.906
I'm not familiar with
how you greet people

370
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:09.374
in this dimension,
but okay...

371
00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:10.608
(<i> screaming</i> )

372
00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.076
(<i> screaming</i> )

373
00:15:12.112 --> 00:15:13.077
(<i> all screaming</i> )

374
00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:14.345
(<i> bike bell rings</i> )

375
00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:15.413
ALL:
Hi, Timmy.

376
00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:18.082
(<i> screaming</i> )

377
00:15:18.118 --> 00:15:19.517
SOLO:
Scream all you want.

378
00:15:19.552 --> 00:15:21.552
ALL:
We're still going
to kick your butt

379
00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:22.586
at the science fair tomorrow.

380
00:15:23.123 --> 00:15:23.454
(<i> all laughing</i> )

381
00:15:24.157 --> 00:15:26.490
Oh, no, that kid
isn't Timmy.

382
00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:28.859
His swirly, fudgey hair
is way too perfect.

383
00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:31.796
Worse, if he finds out
that we're Timmy's
fairies,

384
00:15:31.831 --> 00:15:33.631
we'll have to
go away forever.

385
00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:35.266
What are you?

386
00:15:35.302 --> 00:15:37.001
I'm Cosmo!

387
00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:38.436
And I'm Wanda.

388
00:15:38.471 --> 00:15:41.306
BOTH:
And we're... um...

389
00:15:41.341 --> 00:15:43.174
Holograms,
of course.

390
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.575
Hey, hands off
the wife!

391
00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:46.577
Oh, and capable

392
00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.379
of independent rational thought.

393
00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:51.382
You must have been programmed
for super-intelligence.

394
00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:52.883
Did you hear that?

395
00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.752
He called me
super-intelligent!

396
00:15:55.422 --> 00:15:56.787
This looks like a job for...

397
00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:58.556
my brain!

398
00:15:58.591 --> 00:16:00.491
Go ahead, go ahead,
ask me something.

399
00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:02.260
Why are you still talking?!

400
00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:03.294
Seven!

401
00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:04.728
Hey, Timmy!

402
00:16:05.665 --> 00:16:08.666
Ready for school
and the big science fair?

403
00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:10.868
It's not Timmy, it's Jimmy.

404
00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:12.003
Jimmy Neutron.

405
00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:13.037
Oh, sure it is, son.

406
00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:14.572
I'm sure this
amazing disguise

407
00:16:14.607 --> 00:16:16.174
has nothing to do
with the fact

408
00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:18.042
that you don't want
to go to school

409
00:16:18.078 --> 00:16:19.277
because you didn't
finish

410
00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:21.980
your science fair
experiment.

411
00:16:22.015 --> 00:16:24.282
I remember the time
you wanted to avoid

412
00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.684
that math exam
and you were Kent Quasar.

413
00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:28.886
When you didn't want
to go to the dentist

414
00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:29.887
you were Buzz Adams.

415
00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:31.122
(<i> laughing</i> )

416
00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:32.523
Oh, it's rich!

417
00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:35.059
I don't have time to do
a science fair project,

418
00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:36.060
and I'm not Timmy!

419
00:16:36.096 --> 00:16:37.295
Of course you're not.

420
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.463
That's why we
brought not-Vicky,

421
00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:39.497
your not-baby-sitter

422
00:16:40.233 --> 00:16:41.332
to not bring you
to not-school.

423
00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:43.434
Don't worry, Mr. Turner.

424
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:47.238
I'll make sure Jimmy here
gets to school safe and sound.

425
00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:49.007
(<i> loud smack</i> )

426
00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:51.742
(<i> straining</i> ):
As soon as I get
this fake head off.

427
00:16:53.613 --> 00:16:55.446
Aren't you going a little fast?

428
00:16:55.482 --> 00:16:57.581
You'll never stop in time
at this velocity.

429
00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:58.516
Stopping?

430
00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:00.151
That's funny.

431
00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.820
(<i> Jimmy screams</i> )

432
00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:05.556
Different world, same physics.

433
00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:06.757
BOTH:
Hi, Not-Timmy!

434
00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:08.393
You two!

435
00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:10.228
You got to help me
get back to my world

436
00:17:10.263 --> 00:17:11.262
and get that other kid
back here.

437
00:17:11.898 --> 00:17:13.264
We can't
do that, Jimmy.

438
00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:14.865
Timmy's got
to wish for it.

439
00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:16.567
So you only respond
to a voice command

440
00:17:17.337 --> 00:17:19.337
from a specific
human frequency?

441
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.805
I still have no idea
what you're saying.

442
00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:24.909
Kent Quasar didn't choke cats.

443
00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:28.112
You seem to be able
to alter your appearance

444
00:17:28.681 --> 00:17:30.181
and location at will.

445
00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:33.084
Well, Timmy doesn't want
anybody to know about us.

446
00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:34.452
We have to be careful.

447
00:17:34.487 --> 00:17:37.955
That's probably because
you're imperfect prototypes.

448
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.989
Well, she might not
be perfect,

449
00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:41.492
but she's the one
who said yes.

450
00:17:41.528 --> 00:17:42.527
Aw...

451
00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:43.594
Hey!

452
00:17:44.597 --> 00:17:46.664
JIMMY:
Science fair?

453
00:17:46.699 --> 00:17:47.798
That means
fellow scientists.

454
00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:50.334
Maybe one of them
is smart enough

455
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.403
to explain
this dimension's technology.

456
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.874
ALL:
Hey, it's Kent Quasar!

457
00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.376
I'm not Kent Quasar!

458
00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:01.512
Oh, right-- Buzz Adams.

459
00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:03.347
No, Jimmy Neutron!

460
00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:05.849
ALL (<i> sarcastically</i> ):
Right...

461
00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:07.585
Nice new big-head disguise,
Timmy.

462
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:10.788
Didn't do your science fair
project, huh?

463
00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:11.456
Huh?

464
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:12.090
Huh?

465
00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:12.756
Huh?

466
00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:13.458
Huh?

467
00:18:13.493 --> 00:18:14.024
Huh?

468
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:14.392
Huh?

469
00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:17.661
No, I'm not Timmy!

470
00:18:17.697 --> 00:18:18.662
I'm Jimmy!

471
00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:19.263
Jimmy Neutron.

472
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.866
And I am not Sanjay,
I am Yogi Bear,

473
00:18:22.902 --> 00:18:25.736
and I am smarter
than the average bear.

474
00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:32.343
Another reality avoidance
costume, eh, Turner?

475
00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:33.411
Very well.

476
00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:36.013
Since you're clearly
Timmy Turner,

477
00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:37.715
here's your daily "F"!

478
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.083
Ah, an "F"!

479
00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.184
It burns!

480
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.819
(<i> screaming</i> )

481
00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:44.755
Oh, but that's not all.

482
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.390
Plus, since
you're Turner,

483
00:18:46.426 --> 00:18:48.826
you get the series
of vicious beatings

484
00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:50.694
I had planned
for you today.

485
00:18:54.534 --> 00:18:57.801
Hey, there's no skull
in this fake head.

486
00:18:57.837 --> 00:19:00.505
And there's still more.

487
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.007
You still have to do
your science fair project,

488
00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:04.742
which you haven't
even started.

489
00:19:04.777 --> 00:19:06.110
I'm not Timmy Turner!

490
00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:08.812
And what do you mean
he hasn't started yet?

491
00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:10.848
He invented this
teleporting pen.

492
00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:12.650
He's a genius.

493
00:19:19.058 --> 00:19:20.324
Egad!

494
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:23.227
Uh, finger-paint!

495
00:19:23.263 --> 00:19:26.063
You are not
the boss of me!

496
00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.032
At last, at last!

497
00:19:34.274 --> 00:19:35.306
Fairies!

498
00:19:47.153 --> 00:19:48.986
Gigantic craniums...

499
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.488
teleporting pens...

500
00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:53.257
children claiming to be smarter
than the average bear.

501
00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:55.326
There's only one
logical explanation

502
00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:57.094
for Turner's head
becoming that large:

503
00:19:57.597 --> 00:19:59.263
fairy godparents!

504
00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:02.833
I knew it was only
a matter of time

505
00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.236
before my diabolical
transportation science fair

506
00:20:06.239 --> 00:20:08.138
caused one of those children
to invent a device

507
00:20:09.442 --> 00:20:14.645
that I could use to teleport me
to the legendary... Fairy World!

508
00:20:19.018 --> 00:20:22.353
Home of fairy godparents!

509
00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:25.656
I must get that magic pen.

510
00:20:25.692 --> 00:20:26.724
Pen!

511
00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:28.826
I mean, fairies!

512
00:20:31.364 --> 00:20:32.896
What am I doing back here?

513
00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:36.100
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )
Oh, no!

514
00:20:36.135 --> 00:20:38.769
Something's wrong with
Goddard's molecular structure!

515
00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:40.471
These readings
are off the scale.

516
00:20:40.506 --> 00:20:43.674
Maybe it responds to voice
commands like Cosmo and Wanda.

517
00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:46.143
Uh, actually...

518
00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:48.246
To Retroville!

519
00:20:49.616 --> 00:20:52.316
Hmm, why didn't it work?

520
00:20:52.352 --> 00:20:54.652
There's probably so much
technology in this room

521
00:20:55.488 --> 00:20:57.821
it's interfering
with the teleporter.

522
00:20:57.857 --> 00:20:59.757
I should get farther away.

523
00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:01.726
To Retroville!

524
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:05.229
Darn it!

525
00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:07.732
To Retroville!

526
00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:11.335
Hey, your head
looks smaller!

527
00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:14.204
What? I'm just trying
to be supportive.

528
00:21:15.675 --> 00:21:18.041
<i>Llevame a Retroville!</i>

529
00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:22.045
<i>Hola, Señor Fudge-head.</i>

530
00:21:22.081 --> 00:21:23.414
(<i> donkey braying</i> )

531
00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:25.182
What's the deal with this thing?

532
00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:27.318
It only teleports me
back to this room.

533
00:21:27.353 --> 00:21:28.452
Sorry, amigo.

534
00:21:28.488 --> 00:21:30.187
It's specifically
designed

535
00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:32.089
to teleport Timmy
back to his room.

536
00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.759
Aw, that's limited.

537
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:35.826
Hmm...

538
00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:39.863
Hey, a Game Buddy!

539
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.766
If this pen's
technology

540
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:43.401
is as adaptive
as you guys are,

541
00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:45.503
I should be able to combine it
with this

542
00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:46.937
so I can teleport anywhere--

543
00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:49.006
even home.

544
00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:51.442
Retroville, all right!

545
00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:52.677
I'm out of here!

546
00:21:52.712 --> 00:21:54.878
You're not going anywhere,
Turner.

547
00:21:57.483 --> 00:22:00.685
Now that I have
this magic pen,<i> I</i> am!

548
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.952
(<i> cackling</i> )

549
00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:02.920
Magic?

550
00:22:02.955 --> 00:22:03.921
Are you nuts?

551
00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:05.889
There's no such thing as magic.

552
00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:08.659
You're not fooling me, Turner.

553
00:22:08.695 --> 00:22:09.927
No magic, eh?

554
00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:18.436
Then what do you make
of this?

555
00:22:18.471 --> 00:22:19.704
(<i> cackling</i> )

556
00:22:19.739 --> 00:22:22.239

557
00:22:22.809 --> 00:22:24.208
(<i> stops abruptly</i> )

558
00:22:24.243 --> 00:22:25.209
Oh, no!

559
00:22:25.244 --> 00:22:26.944
We're in Fairy World!

560
00:22:26.979 --> 00:22:28.713
Way to go, genius!

561
00:22:33.786 --> 00:22:37.087
Tell me more about
your interests,
Timmy Turner.

562
00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:38.389
What makes you tick?

563
00:22:38.424 --> 00:22:39.523
(<i> slurping</i> )

564
00:22:39.559 --> 00:22:40.324
Stuff makes me tick.

565
00:22:40.926 --> 00:22:42.460
Junk makes me tick, too.

566
00:22:42.495 --> 00:22:44.194
But wicked-awesome stuff,

567
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.430
that's what really
makes me tick.

568
00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:47.631
Incredible.

569
00:22:48.434 --> 00:22:50.334
The technology
you're talking about

570
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.769
must be on
the cutting edge

571
00:22:51.804 --> 00:22:54.004
of the very latest
scientific paradigms.

572
00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:54.872
You talk funny.

573
00:22:54.907 --> 00:22:55.873
Small-Headed Jimmy!

574
00:22:55.908 --> 00:22:56.841
Small-Headed Jimmy!

575
00:22:56.876 --> 00:22:57.875
Come quickly!

576
00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.276
Goddard's gone berserk!

577
00:22:59.912 --> 00:23:01.211
You have to fix everything

578
00:23:01.247 --> 00:23:03.814
just like you used to
when you had a big head.

579
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:04.548
What?

580
00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:06.450
Come see for yourself.

581
00:23:08.488 --> 00:23:10.053
(<i> Goddard roaring</i> )

582
00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:11.622
Heel, boy-- stay!

583
00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.891
Stay... Down!

584
00:23:13.926 --> 00:23:15.526
Good, giant
mechanical Goddard.

585
00:23:15.561 --> 00:23:16.494
Good, good. Stay.

586
00:23:16.529 --> 00:23:19.196

588
00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:24.869
Wow! Cool, the dog-box
became the Decimator!

589
00:23:24.904 --> 00:23:29.172
It took a long time to download,
but I think it paid off.

590
00:23:29.208 --> 00:23:31.074
You mean you did this?

591
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.777
Well, it is my game.

592
00:23:32.812 --> 00:23:34.378
You design software, too?

593
00:23:34.947 --> 00:23:37.548
Timmy, you're amazing.

594
00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:39.316
(<i> Goddard's servos whirring</i> )

595
00:23:41.487 --> 00:23:42.820
New Jimmy--
do something!

596
00:23:42.855 --> 00:23:44.688
Your dad's about
to get stomped!

597
00:23:44.724 --> 00:23:46.791
Aw, relax, it's just
a harmless game.

598
00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:49.393
Besides, at this level,
Decimator is so slow

599
00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:52.696
you'd have to stand absolutely
still for him to get you.

600
00:23:52.732 --> 00:23:54.698
(<i> shouting</i> )

601
00:23:54.734 --> 00:23:56.500
Oh! Ow!

602
00:23:56.536 --> 00:23:59.136
Does your game have
a lot of cool features?

603
00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:02.139
Basically,
Decimator locks on
to moving targets,

604
00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:05.743
then, every time
he defeats a player,
he gets bigger.

605
00:24:09.849 --> 00:24:10.915
Ha-ha-ha!

606
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.750
Ooh! Ooh! Show me
how to play!

607
00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:13.884
Show me how to play!

608
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.218
Me next, me next!

609
00:24:15.254 --> 00:24:17.788
Look, guys, you're cramping
my style--

610
00:24:17.824 --> 00:24:19.990
which apparently I have
in this universe.

611
00:24:20.726 --> 00:24:22.960
I think Cindy actually likes me.

612
00:24:22.995 --> 00:24:25.095
Eww!
Eww!

So, I'll see
you guys later.

622
00:24:43.616 --> 00:24:44.214
Me and Cindy
are going

623
00:24:45.084 --> 00:24:47.618
to try out some
more science projects.

624
00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:48.686
Ready, Cindy?

625
00:24:48.721 --> 00:24:50.087
You bet.

626
00:24:50.122 --> 00:24:51.522
Ugh, I may be sick.

627
00:24:51.557 --> 00:24:53.156
Oh, it's okay, Libby.

628
00:24:53.192 --> 00:24:55.493
You can be new best friends
with us.

629
00:24:55.962 --> 00:24:57.561
I may be sicker!

630
00:24:57.597 --> 00:24:59.897
Don't worry kids, I got...

Let's get my video camera.

Sheen, no.

646
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.540
It's up to us
to stop it.

647
00:25:42.575 --> 00:25:44.307
Jimmy's gone,
new Jimmy's useless,

648
00:25:44.343 --> 00:25:46.376
and Cindy's acting
like a complete snob--

649
00:25:46.412 --> 00:25:47.110
I mean, what's up
with that?

650
00:25:47.847 --> 00:25:49.713
Tell me about it,
girlfriend.

651
00:25:49.749 --> 00:25:51.715
You're right, Libby,
it's up to us,

652
00:25:51.751 --> 00:25:55.019
which is why I have
comformulated a bold plan.

To the emergency space pods!

654
00:25:58.591 --> 00:26:00.390
Why don't we just
go after the dog?

655
00:26:00.426 --> 00:26:01.692
That works, too.

656
00:26:04.997 --> 00:26:08.131
So, Dr. Mildew, once again

657
00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:10.534
I've foiled your insidious plan.

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:24.048
You were right,
Cindy,

660
00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:26.016
mutating stuff is fun.

661
00:26:26.052 --> 00:26:27.017
And easy.

662
00:26:27.053 --> 00:26:28.052
Just remember:

663
00:26:28.087 --> 00:26:29.787
the left button is
for animal DNA,

664
00:26:29.822 --> 00:26:30.955
the right button is

for plants
and some algae.

00:26:33.125 --> 00:26:34.992
Cool! You're
the smartest girl

a lot of girls
talk to me,

to take our relationship
to the next level.

are smart and pretty.

still like me

even if I weren't smart,

700
00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:05.182
wouldn't you?

701
00:28:05.217 --> 00:28:06.349
Ha-- of course not.

702
00:28:06.886 --> 00:28:08.018
But it's irrelevant,

703
00:28:08.054 --> 00:28:10.387
because you're

724
00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:57.467
He gave his life to save us.

725
00:28:58.337 --> 00:29:00.503
I won't let his sacrifice
be in vain!

726
00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:04.041
(<i> groaning</i> )

727
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.944
I am going to have to punish
that dog.

728
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.347
I'm going to need
a really big newspaper.

729
00:29:10.382 --> 00:29:11.782
I'll wait till Sunday.

730
00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:14.985
(<i> coughs</i> )

731
00:29:15.988 --> 00:29:19.256
Oh, man... can't take
these fumes much longer.

732
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:20.557
Whoa!

733
00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.592
Uh... uh...

734
00:29:22.628 --> 00:29:24.228
I wish I could see Cindy
one more time--

735
00:29:24.897 --> 00:29:25.462
I never got a picture of her

736
00:29:26.365 --> 00:29:28.365
to prove to my friends
she really exists!

737
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.700
CINDY (<i> over radio</i> ):
Timmy, can you read me?

738
00:29:30.736 --> 00:29:31.701
Are you okay?

739
00:29:31.737 --> 00:29:32.936
Cindy? Where are you...

740
00:29:32.972 --> 00:29:34.571
and do you have a digital camera

741
00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:37.841
and a computer that can send a
picture to a parallel universe?

742
00:29:37.877 --> 00:29:39.309
CINDY:
Um, no.

743
00:29:39.344 --> 00:29:42.512
I managed to tap in to
your mini-laser's frequency.

744
00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:43.647
It's not my poofer?

745
00:29:43.682 --> 00:29:45.682
Then I'm going to be dipped
in acid!

746
00:29:47.086 --> 00:29:50.220
Try using the mini-laser
to cut that rail you're on.

747
00:29:52.258 --> 00:29:53.023
(<i> humming</i> )

748
00:29:53.058 --> 00:29:55.659
(<i> moaning</i> )

749
00:29:57.263 --> 00:29:58.929
Wow, it worked.

750
00:29:58.964 --> 00:30:00.497
All right!

751
00:30:00.532 --> 00:30:03.233
I took a girl's advice
and it worked!

752
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:05.135
(<i> moaning</i> )

753
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:07.404
I did it, Cindy, now what?

754
00:30:07.439 --> 00:30:08.672
I have an idea.

755
00:30:08.707 --> 00:30:10.841
If I can guide you
to Goddard's power core,

756
00:30:10.876 --> 00:30:11.241
we might shut him down.

757
00:30:12.211 --> 00:30:13.877
Sounds good to me,
just tell me where to go.

758
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.479
Down the corridor
and left, quick!

759
00:30:20.686 --> 00:30:23.854
(<i> Decimator roaring</i> )

760
00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:29.759
He's targeting
the Purple Flurp
factory!

761
00:30:29.795 --> 00:30:31.228
Oh, no, if
he destroys it

762
00:30:31.263 --> 00:30:32.762
he might cause
a Flurp spill!

763
00:30:32.798 --> 00:30:34.898
That much corrosive sugar
could dissolve

764
00:30:34.934 --> 00:30:35.999
all of Retroville--

765
00:30:36.035 --> 00:30:37.868
just look what it did
to my molars.

766
00:30:37.903 --> 00:30:38.869
Shut it.

767
00:30:38.904 --> 00:30:39.837
Sorry.

768
00:30:39.872 --> 00:30:41.771
Timmy, we're out of time.

769
00:30:41.807 --> 00:30:43.240
You'll never make it.

770
00:30:43.275 --> 00:30:44.474
Think of something!

771
00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:45.642
CINDY:
Um, um, um...

772
00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:46.710
try a brain blast!

773
00:30:46.745 --> 00:30:47.744
A what?

774
00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:48.712
A sudden burst

775
00:30:48.747 --> 00:30:49.913
of intuitive insight.

776
00:30:49.949 --> 00:30:51.915
Something to save our butts now!

777
00:30:51.951 --> 00:30:53.416
I don't know
what she's talking about,

778
00:30:54.053 --> 00:30:55.352
but she's counting on me.

779
00:30:55.387 --> 00:30:56.920
Got to think. Think. Think!

780
00:30:56.956 --> 00:30:57.454
I'm bored again.

781
00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.123
I wish I could just
pop the disk out

782
00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:02.559
and quit before I lose,
just like I do at home.

783
00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:04.494
TIMMY:
Quitting always works.

784
00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:05.795
Timmy, that's it!

785
00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:08.332
If you can disconnect the drive,
it's game over.

786
00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:12.936
New Player, you have dared
to challenge Decimator?

787
00:31:12.972 --> 00:31:15.472
Your future is canceled!

788
00:31:15.507 --> 00:31:16.373
Find the green terminal box

789
00:31:16.976 --> 00:31:18.242
and pull the red switch.

790
00:31:18.277 --> 00:31:19.343
Got it!

791
00:31:20.412 --> 00:31:22.545
He's arming
his rockets!

792
00:31:22.581 --> 00:31:25.249
Timmy, get that box open!

793
00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:28.618
Oh, no-- my laser's
out of juice!

794
00:31:29.255 --> 00:31:31.521
You can do it,
new Jimmy.

795
00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:33.023
Use your giant teeth!

796
00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:37.460
(<i> spits</i> )

797
00:31:42.101 --> 00:31:43.566
Whoo-hoo, yes!

798
00:31:43.602 --> 00:31:45.335
Victory is mine!

799
00:31:45.371 --> 00:31:46.669
Who says quitters never win?

800
00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:48.972
I'm the king of the...

801
00:31:49.008 --> 00:31:50.374
Whoa... whoa!

802
00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.646
I'm okay.

803
00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:57.948
You did it, Cindy,

804
00:31:57.983 --> 00:31:58.949
you and Timmy saved the town!

805
00:31:59.785 --> 00:32:02.585
Too bad about
Jimmy's dad,
though.

806
00:32:02.621 --> 00:32:06.423
Green... leftovers...
my one... weakness.

807
00:32:06.458 --> 00:32:08.025
Quick, Lintboy...

808
00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.094
help me reach my...
utility belt.

809
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.562
Oh, not tonight,
Sugar Booger,

810
00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:14.932
Lintboy needs
to spend time

811
00:32:14.967 --> 00:32:16.633
in his fortress
of iodine.

812
00:32:16.668 --> 00:32:18.035
Door closed.

813
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.970
Strength returning.

814
00:32:20.005 --> 00:32:22.439
Mighty Mom lives!

(<i> glass shattering</i> )

816
00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:25.775
I'll clean that up.

817
00:32:31.016 --> 00:32:32.249
Way to go, Cindy!

818
00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:33.516
I knew you could do it!

819
00:32:33.552 --> 00:32:36.219
You don't fool me
for one second, Timmy,

820
00:32:36.255 --> 00:32:37.854
I'm smart enough
to see through

821
00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:38.888
your little
shammy-sham.

822
00:32:39.158 --> 00:32:39.489
Huh?

823
00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:41.024
What are you
talking about?

824
00:32:41.593 --> 00:32:42.725
You made it seem like

825
00:32:42.761 --> 00:32:44.727
you didn't know
what you were doing.

826
00:32:44.763 --> 00:32:46.263
You created
this whole crisis

827
00:32:46.298 --> 00:32:47.597
just so I could
solve it.

828
00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:49.166
Well, for your
information, Mister,

829
00:32:50.002 --> 00:32:53.770
I think that was
unbelievably sweet.

830
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:56.974
Ah, gross!

831
00:32:57.009 --> 00:32:58.842
Who's up for
a group hurl?

832
00:32:58.877 --> 00:33:00.610
Hey-- Goddard's
shrinking.

833
00:33:06.118 --> 00:33:07.951
His normal program
is rebooting.

834
00:33:07.987 --> 00:33:09.819
He should be
his old self again.

835

(<i> barks</i> )

836
00:33:10.956 --> 00:33:12.189
Whoo-hoo!

837
00:33:12.224 --> 00:33:13.857
Good job,
Goddard!

838
00:33:13.892 --> 00:33:16.826
Look, something's coming up
on his screen.

839
00:33:16.862 --> 00:33:17.827
Calling Goddard.

840
00:33:17.863 --> 00:33:18.795
Can you hear me?

841
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:19.829
Come in, boy.

842
00:33:19.865 --> 00:33:20.897
My readings indicate

843
00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:22.299
you're now back to normal.

Hey, it's that kid,

845
00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:25.802
CINDY:
It's Neutron.

846
00:33:28.807 --> 00:33:30.173
But I thought that...

847
00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:30.974
Then you're not...

848
00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:34.478
Everything I know
is a lie!

849
00:33:34.513 --> 00:33:36.980
Hey, what are you doing
in Fairy World?

850
00:33:37.016 --> 00:33:40.884
Well, some lunatic sucked me
into your computer simulation.

851
00:33:40.919 --> 00:33:41.551
What lunatic?

852
00:33:42.021 --> 00:33:43.186
(<i> laughing</i> )

853
00:33:43.455 --> 00:33:44.787
No!

854
00:33:47.826 --> 00:33:49.759
(<i> Crocker laughing</i>
<i>hysterically</i> )

855
00:33:52.731 --> 00:33:55.332
Finally, I'm in!

856
00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:58.435
I've made it to
the legendary Fairy World!

857
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.536
(<i> laughing</i> )

858
00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:00.937
They said it didn't exist.

859
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.772
They said I was crazy...

860
00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:03.273
and I am!

861
00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:06.976
Crazy like a guy who was right
about Fairy World!

862
00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:10.514
I think I'll take the VIP tour.

863
00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:12.815
BOTH:
Crocker!

864
00:34:15.087 --> 00:34:18.088
Ladies and gentlemen,
girls and boys,

865
00:34:18.123 --> 00:34:20.323
welcome to Fairy World's
VIP tour.

866
00:34:20.359 --> 00:34:22.725
Uh, excuse me,
are you a human?

867
00:34:22.761 --> 00:34:24.227
No...

868
00:34:24.263 --> 00:34:25.529
Uh, I'm a nymph.

869
00:34:25.564 --> 00:34:27.864
Anyone but a nymph
wear a hat this stupid?

870
00:34:28.934 --> 00:34:31.268
Oh. It looks good on you,
though.

871
00:34:31.303 --> 00:34:32.102
Then welcome aboard.

872
00:34:32.604 --> 00:34:34.071
On with the tour.

873
00:34:34.106 --> 00:34:36.139
You brought Mr. Crocker
to Fairy World?

874
00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:38.542
What kind of genius
are you?

875
00:34:38.577 --> 00:34:41.978
You scrambled my dog's atoms
and let a girl in my lab?

876
00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:43.346
What kind of genius are<i> you?</i>

877
00:34:43.882 --> 00:34:45.348
Back off, Nerdtron.

878
00:34:45.384 --> 00:34:47.784
Timmy here has already
saved the day--

879
00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:48.885
and saved your dog--

880
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.954
in half the time
you would have.

881
00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:52.489
Look, I need you to...

882
00:34:52.524 --> 00:34:54.891
Uh, like I care about
what you need.

883
00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.326
As long as my dog's okay,

884
00:34:56.728 --> 00:34:57.794
we are done.

885
00:34:59.498 --> 00:35:01.531
TOUR GUIDE:
And that's
the Fairy Academy,

886
00:35:01.567 --> 00:35:03.700
where we train
fairy godparents.

887
00:35:03.735 --> 00:35:04.901
Fire!

888
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.803
(<i> coughs</i> )

889
00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:08.505
That's okay,
we're here to learn.

890
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.341
TOUR GUIDE:
And over there is
the Fairy Armory,

891
00:35:11.376 --> 00:35:15.212
where we store every magical
fairy weapon known to fairies.

892
00:35:15.247 --> 00:35:17.013
It's the only place
in Fairy World

893
00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:18.615
that, in case of an emergency,

894
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.184
has its own power supply.

895
00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.085
Any questions?

896
00:35:22.121 --> 00:35:23.453
I have a question!

897
00:35:23.489 --> 00:35:25.655
Let's say I was this human.

898
00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.991
If I somehow stole
that magical weaponry,

899
00:35:28.693 --> 00:35:31.161
would I be able to, say, oh...

900
00:35:31.196 --> 00:35:33.029
force the surrender
of Fairy World

901
00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:34.897
and be made king of all fairies?

902
00:35:34.933 --> 00:35:35.999
Oh, absolutely--

903
00:35:36.034 --> 00:35:38.067
especially if
you were evil enough

904
00:35:38.103 --> 00:35:38.901
to destroy the Big Wand;

905
00:35:39.771 --> 00:35:42.372
that's what powers
all our magic wands.

906
00:35:42.407 --> 00:35:44.707
If you took that out,
we'd have to surrender.

907
00:35:44.743 --> 00:35:45.408
Since there's
no chance of that,

908
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:49.513
let's talk about
the exciting world of crowds.

909
00:35:49.548 --> 00:35:51.881
Thank you for your
very informative tour.

910
00:35:53.285 --> 00:35:54.251
Ah!

911
00:35:54.286 --> 00:35:55.619
The Fairy Armory.

912
00:35:56.888 --> 00:35:59.389
Just think of the fairy havoc
I can wreak

913
00:35:59.424 --> 00:36:00.923
with these fairy weapons!

914
00:36:00.959 --> 00:36:01.924
Think!

915
00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.627
I mean... fairies!

916
00:36:03.662 --> 00:36:04.861
Crocker's gone!

917
00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:06.463
That means I'm stuck here?

918
00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:08.931
I got to get that teleportation
device and get out of here.

919
00:36:09.535 --> 00:36:11.067
Can this get any worse?

920
00:36:13.772 --> 00:36:15.071
If by worse you mean

921
00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:17.541
somebody's knocking over
the Big Wand, then yes.

922
00:36:17.576 --> 00:36:19.108
(<i> screaming</i> )

923
00:36:21.513 --> 00:36:22.912
(<i> laughing maniacally</i> )

924
00:36:23.582 --> 00:36:25.815
I knocked over the Big Wand!

925
00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:33.690
(<i> laughing</i> )

926
00:36:33.725 --> 00:36:35.925
Freeze!

927
00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.260
Magic or not,

928
00:36:37.296 --> 00:36:39.362
I am still powerful enough
to defeat you

929
00:36:39.398 --> 00:36:42.098
with my special brand
of fairy justice.

930
00:36:45.571 --> 00:36:46.536
Woof!

931
00:36:46.572 --> 00:36:47.571
Woof, woof!

932
00:36:47.606 --> 00:36:48.572
Bark, bark.

933
00:36:48.607 --> 00:36:49.105
Woof!

934
00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:50.940
I will defeat you...

935
00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:54.311
after I defeat this
evil stump of a tail!

936
00:36:54.346 --> 00:36:55.679
(<i> laughing</i> )

937
00:36:57.316 --> 00:36:59.082
What's wrong with you guys?

938
00:36:59.117 --> 00:37:00.717
Oh, he's cut off
our supply of magic.

939
00:37:01.587 --> 00:37:04.254
That's right--
I'm in charge here now.

940
00:37:04.656 --> 00:37:05.922
Get ready...

941
00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:08.592
to make me your king!

942
00:37:08.627 --> 00:37:10.627
If we're going to get
that teleportation pen,

943
00:37:11.096 --> 00:37:12.429
now's my chance.

944
00:37:12.464 --> 00:37:13.663
Hey, what are you doing?

945
00:37:14.266 --> 00:37:15.265
Making an electromagnet.

946
00:37:16.268 --> 00:37:18.835
By wrapping this wire
around this metal crown,

947
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.570
and attaching it
to this power source,

948
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.374
I can create an
electromagnetic coil!

949
00:37:26.144 --> 00:37:28.311
Steady.

950
00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:31.848
Voilà!

951
00:37:32.784 --> 00:37:35.785
Thank you, electromagnetic
valence bonding.

952
00:37:39.224 --> 00:37:40.390
(<i> laughs maniacally</i> )

953
00:37:49.033 --> 00:37:50.734
(<i> laughing maniacally</i> )

954
00:37:52.003 --> 00:37:52.935
Good luck with
your new king.

955
00:37:53.438 --> 00:37:53.903
Wait, fudge-head.

956
00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:55.405
You can't leave us.

957
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.374
Crocker's going to...

958
00:37:57.409 --> 00:37:58.375
Zap the memory?

959
00:37:58.410 --> 00:37:59.509
Wipe the C drive?

960
00:37:59.544 --> 00:38:00.477
So what?

961
00:38:00.512 --> 00:38:02.011
You're computer programs.

962
00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:03.780
You're not really real, right?

963
00:38:03.815 --> 00:38:06.349
If we weren't real,
could I do this?

964
00:38:06.685 --> 00:38:07.850
Or this?

965
00:38:07.886 --> 00:38:10.787
Or could I do this?

966
00:38:10.822 --> 00:38:13.456
Cosmo, Wanda, finally!

967
00:38:13.492 --> 00:38:14.056
Timmy, you have
to stop him.

968
00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:17.294
He's going to let
Crocker wipe
our C drive,

969
00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:18.495
whatever that means,

970
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:19.028
and I like to wipe my own stuff.

971
00:38:20.198 --> 00:38:23.032
How many times do
I have to tell you,
you aren't real.

972
00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:24.033
TIMMY:
Yes.

973
00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:25.268
Yes, they are.

974
00:38:25.304 --> 00:38:26.536
They are real.

975
00:38:26.571 --> 00:38:28.237
What do you mean "real"?

976
00:38:28.273 --> 00:38:28.738
You're holograms.

977
00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:31.341
All of this is
a big computer game.

978
00:38:31.376 --> 00:38:33.310
How do you care
so much about them?

979
00:38:33.345 --> 00:38:35.912
(<i> whimpering</i> )

980
00:38:35.947 --> 00:38:36.413
Goddard?

981
00:38:36.948 --> 00:38:38.481
Of course-- Goddard.

982
00:38:38.517 --> 00:38:40.784
He's computerized, isn't he?

983
00:38:40.819 --> 00:38:43.620
Well, Cosmo and Wanda
are as real to me

984
00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:45.221
as Goddard is to you.

985
00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:48.057
Look, I'm sorry
I broke into your lab.

986
00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:49.726
I'm sorry I almost
broke Goddard.

987
00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:53.029
What about the girl
in my lab?!

988
00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.698
I'm sorry about that, too.

989
00:38:54.733 --> 00:38:55.932
CINDY:
Hey!

990
00:38:55.967 --> 00:38:57.934
(<i> whispering</i> );
Play along, toots.

991
00:38:57.969 --> 00:39:00.303
Jimmy, you have to save
Cosmo and Wanda.

992
00:39:00.339 --> 00:39:01.404
They're my
best friends.

993
00:39:01.807 --> 00:39:02.806
You have to!

994
00:39:04.409 --> 00:39:05.908
CROCKER:
Oh, fiddlesticks!

995
00:39:05.944 --> 00:39:07.243
How could I miss that?

996
00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:08.745
I was aiming for
his big fake head.

997
00:39:09.414 --> 00:39:10.814
Do something,
Fudge-head.

998
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:12.181
Do something...

999
00:39:12.217 --> 00:39:13.316
Fudge-head.

1000
00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:17.186
Wow, they're really upset.

1001
00:39:17.222 --> 00:39:19.222
Maybe these are more
than just holograms.

1002
00:39:19.257 --> 00:39:20.056
(<i> barking</i> )

1003
00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:21.290
So if they disappear,

1004
00:39:21.326 --> 00:39:22.525
they're gone for good.

1005
00:39:22.561 --> 00:39:23.860
I can't let that happen.

1006
00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:25.995
I've got to do something.

1007
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.996
But what?

1008
00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:28.164
Come on, think.

1009
00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:29.566
<i>Think!</i>

1010
00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:37.039
Hey, Timmy, are you ready
for the big science fair?

1011
00:39:37.075 --> 00:39:40.777
(<i> laughing maniacally</i> )

1012
00:39:43.348 --> 00:39:44.947
Brain blast!

1013
00:39:44.983 --> 00:39:47.183
You guys do what you can
to stall Crocker.

1014
00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:48.651
I'll be right back.

1015
00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:51.721
Oh, no!

1016
00:39:51.757 --> 00:39:53.022
Fudge-head left us.

1017
00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:55.425
I always knew you couldn't trust
a fudge-head.

1018
00:39:57.161 --> 00:40:00.963
I need raw, uncompromised
technology, and fast.

1019
00:40:05.169 --> 00:40:06.202
(<i> sniffs</i> )

1020
00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:07.771
Ah, silicone and test tubes.

1021
00:40:08.306 --> 00:40:10.373
I missed that smell.

1022
00:40:21.386 --> 00:40:23.887
One solar-powered laser...

1023
00:40:26.324 --> 00:40:28.257
A fully equipped double-wide,

1024
00:40:28.293 --> 00:40:29.926
and presto.

1025
00:40:57.589 --> 00:41:00.990
After I take care
of one little detail.

1026
00:41:02.694 --> 00:41:04.461
Ah, the fairy capitol building.

1027
00:41:04.496 --> 00:41:05.762
It looks so beautiful

1028
00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:08.865
and so... not ruled by me!

1029
00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.399
We'll have to fix that.

1030
00:41:12.871 --> 00:41:14.471
Freeze, sucker.

1031
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.547
Hey, I should force them
to make me their king.

1032
00:41:24.583 --> 00:41:26.483
Maybe I'll have a court jester.

1033
00:41:26.518 --> 00:41:28.685
I hope he tells jokes
and not riddles.

1034
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.386
Jokes have punch lines.

1035
00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:34.323
You better have punch lines!

1036
00:41:37.696 --> 00:41:38.828
Well, okay,

1037
00:41:38.864 --> 00:41:41.364
but only because you asked.

1038
00:41:43.902 --> 00:41:45.067
(<i> screams</i> )

1039
00:41:46.471 --> 00:41:47.470
You again.

So, Turner,

1044
00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:08.525
that fake-headed
robot suit

1045
00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.894
might intimidate
some other people,

1046
00:42:10.929 --> 00:42:11.928
but you're
still going down.

1047
00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:16.132
And then, I'm going
to give you an F...

I have to tell you?

I'm not Timmy Turner.

1057
00:43:04.649 --> 00:43:07.316
Technically, he's not
even Jimmy Neutron.

1058
00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:11.554
Pay no attention to the fairies
operating the fudge-head suit.

Fairies!

1060
00:43:14.158 --> 00:43:16.059
Ordinarily, this would be
a good thing, but...

1061
00:43:16.628 --> 00:43:18.795
Turner! Where'd he go?

1062

Now!

I don't understand.

You can...

1077
00:44:23.962 --> 00:44:25.995
you can trust
a fudge-head.

Hey, that's my big

(<i> screams</i> )

1088
00:44:50.155 --> 00:44:53.756
Hey, no fair using magic
against me.

1089
00:44:53.792 --> 00:44:55.958
I don't know if I believe
in magic,

1090
00:44:55.994 --> 00:44:58.527
but I do believe
in virtual programming.

1091
00:44:58.563 --> 00:45:01.297
Time to override
your hard drive!

1092
00:45:01.332 --> 00:45:02.298
Hey!

(<i> squealing</i> )

1094
00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:07.570
I surrender!

1095
00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:08.604
Enough!

1096

DOG:
No, it is not enough.

1097
00:45:14.212 --> 00:45:18.181
Get ready, tiny human,
as I shred your memory to bits

1098
00:45:18.216 --> 00:45:20.449
with my muscular canine teeth.

1099

Nice doggy.

1102
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:27.423
And if you'll look to your left,

1103
00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:30.392
you'll see a puny
adult human male
being shredded

1104
00:45:30.428 --> 00:45:31.427
by a buff
magical schnauzer...

1105
00:45:32.363 --> 00:45:34.931
and having his internal
organs rearranged.

Jimmy, you did it!

1108
00:45:37.936 --> 00:45:40.269
And not a hair
out of place.

1109
00:45:40.304 --> 00:45:43.572
Well, I couldn't let anything
happen to my new virtual pals,

1110
00:45:43.608 --> 00:45:44.107
could I?

1111

Ah, don't worry, boy.

1118

All I have to do
is reverse the polarity

1119
00:45:56.755 --> 00:45:58.121
and I can get back home.

1120
00:45:58.156 --> 00:45:59.122
Yeah, yeah.

1121
00:45:59.157 --> 00:46:00.022
I can handle this.

1124

I wish we were both back
in our own hometowns.

1133

Sure, fairy programs.

1134
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.452
Sorry I was such a jerk.

1135
00:46:30.488 --> 00:46:31.687
No problem.

1136
00:46:31.722 --> 00:46:34.957
We<i> geniuses</i> have
to stick together.

Uh, between you and me,
I'm not really all that smart.

1138

I know-- I kind of figured that
out when I saw all the Fs.

1139

(<i> gasps</i> ):
I'll never forget you,
Timmy Turner.

1140

Never!

00:46:46.537 --> 00:46:47.636
Wait for me.

Wait for me!

Cindy, I know you've
been through a lot
the past few hours,

1144

but, um... get out of my lab!

1145
00:47:01.252 --> 00:47:02.618
Well, children,

1146
00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:04.486
since Mr. Crocker
lost his memory,

1147
00:47:04.522 --> 00:47:07.656
apparently in some sort of
bizarre schnauzer incident...

1148
00:47:07.692 --> 00:47:09.758
Schnauzers... No!

1149
00:47:09.794 --> 00:47:10.993
No!

1150
00:47:11.029 --> 00:47:13.229
I'll be judging
the science fair tonight.

1151

(<i> whoops</i> )

1152
00:47:15.533 --> 00:47:18.034
Well, Crocker lost,
Goddard's safe...

1153
00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:21.237
And I met a nice young man
with fudgy hair.

1154
00:47:21.973 --> 00:47:22.705
Not a bad way
to spend a day.

1155
00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:26.275
But I never got my
science fair project done.

1156
00:47:26.311 --> 00:47:27.910
I'm still going to get an F.

1157
00:47:27.946 --> 00:47:31.881
Timmy, where's your
science fair project?

1158
00:47:31.916 --> 00:47:35.184
Well, I... um, you see, I...

1159
00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:42.158
Oh, my.

1160
00:47:47.165 --> 00:47:50.833
Look, it is a flying hound
of robotic descent.

1161
00:47:50.869 --> 00:47:52.034
Why didn't you think of that?

1162
00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:53.602
Hey, I'm just one
of 11 guys.

1163
00:47:54.472 --> 00:47:56.339

I knew I'd figure out

1164

sooner or later.

Timmy, what
an astounding project!

1167
00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.881
You get an "A"
and first prize.

1168
00:48:04.916 --> 00:48:07.917
You're clearly smarter
than A.J. or his clones.

1169
00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:09.986
Thanks, boy genius.

1170
00:48:10.021 --> 00:48:13.256
Ah, don't mention it, average
kid who no one understands.

Is that Timmy?

Timmy!

Hi!

1174
00:48:16.261 --> 00:48:17.260
Tell him I said hi.
