You can't beat me.

36
00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:55.937
You're never gonna be
a Spartan, never.

37

Who the hell is Mr. Bond?

44
00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.291
I'm Leonidas.

45
00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.301
You're testing my patience,
Double-Oh.

46
00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.337
But I am not Double-

This is bullshit!

66
00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:28.939

You dead, Leonidas.

My ass hurt! Oh!

98
00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:04.736
Why you wanna do me like that?

99
00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.897
Come on, man, I could hook you up.

100
00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.133
We could work it out.

101
00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.698

(laughs): What's that?

133
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.426
The combination to my chastity belt.

134
00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:41.559
(excited shuddering):
Oh-

135
00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:45.670
(cheering, whooping)

136
00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.000
PEOPLE: Leonidas!

<i>He wed Margo,</i>
<i>and she bore him a fine son.</i>

140
00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:07.822
<i>And life in the land</i>

(both grunting)

142
00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:12.191
Yes! Yes! Good!

143
00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.493
Thanks, Dad.

Give me your hand.

147
00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:22.036
Remember, Son: A warrior...

148
00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.735
must learn to take a hit.

149
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.778
(grunts, groans)

150
00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:28.006
Fight with your head;

151
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.877
think with your heart.

152
00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:30.916
Huh?

153
00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:32.917
Give him the pile driver, honey.

154
00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.046
Pile driver?

155
00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.090

157
00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:42.423
That's my boy.

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:46.090
(distorted, slow-motion yell)

159
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.762
(both grunt)

160

- My queen.
- (loud slaps)

161
00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:52.428
BOY: No!

162
00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:53.938
- Captain.
- No!

163
00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:56.770
I see Leonidas is molding
our future king of Sparta...

164
00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.242
to be a man.

165
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:02.145
(chain saw roaring)

166
00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.911
I remember when
my father used to beat me.

167
00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:08.252
Traditional rites of passage.

168
00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.748
No. My father was an alcoholic.

169
00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:13.257
(paint gun firing,
pellets ricocheting)

170
00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.122
Ow!

171
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.086
Aah!

172
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.827
Xerxes' messenger awaits, my king.

173
00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.491
(exhales)

174
00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:22.727
(gun fires)

175
00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.439
Greetings, Leonidas.

176
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.136
Greetings, messenger.

177
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.235
(loud kiss)

178
00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:35.780
(spitting): What the hell was that?

179
00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:36.780
What?

180
00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:37.941
You just kissed me!

181
00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:41.009
That is how men of Sparta
greet one another.

182
00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:43.487
High fives for the women...

183
00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:46.354
and open-mouth tongue
kisses for the men.

184
00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.699
Ooh.

185
00:08:56.769 --> 00:08:58.134
I get it.

186
00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.193
Get what?

187
00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:01.866
Uh... y-you have a...

188
00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:03.772
"free society" here.

189
00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:06.004
Yes. The freest.

190
00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:07.807
Uh, not that there's
anything wrong with that.

191
00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:16.279
(whispers): I dig big black dudes.

192
00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:17.788
Yeah.

193
00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:22.658
Come, messenger, let us walk.

194
00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:28.867
The great Xerxes has
taken over the world...

195
00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:30.698
with his vast Persian army...

196
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.933
and has set his sights
on his final conquest-

197
00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.496
Sparta.

198
00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:41.812
Let us talk
by the giant pit of death.

199
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:43.473
Okay.

200
00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.312
Xerxes is a kind god-king...

201
00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:46.817
and offers these...

202
00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:49.184
peaceful alternatives to war.

203
00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:53.020
No blood will be shed...

204
00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:56.186
as long as you Spartan
men build his pyramids...

205
00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.823
your women become his sex slaves...

206
00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.628
and your children...

207
00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:03.430
work at sweatshops...

208
00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:05.265
making Nikes.

209
00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:09.440
That sounds reasonable.

210
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.770
CAPTAI N: I'm sure you would...

211
00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:13.744
think so, Councilman Traitoro.

212
00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:17.882
(woman sings slow,
exotic, ethereal theme)

213
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.919
(wind whistling softly)

214
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.894
##

215
00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:45.570
Tell Xerxes...

216
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.237
(passionate moaning)

217
00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:50.077
...to take his proposal...

218
00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:52.310
and shove it!

219
00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:54.080
What the hell?!

220
00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:56.212
What? He came on to me!

221
00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:57.482
I did not.

222
00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:59.751
Dawg, your wife's a ho.

223
00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:04.158
This means war!

224
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.425
Hey, hey, hey, it's cool, it's cool.

225
00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.023
Uh, we got San Francisco...

226
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.328
and West Hollywood.

227
00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:11.336
We don't need Sparta.
(chuckles)

228
00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:13.634
I'll just tell Xerxes
it's a "no go."

229
00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:16.234
(chuckles)

230
00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:22.911
Kick his ass in.

231
00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:27.145
This is madness!

232
00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:29.244
Madness?

233
00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:34.822
This is Sparta!

234
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.298
Why did you do that?

235
00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.666
He was backing down.

236
00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:47.138
(yells)

237
00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:51.609
My lord, he will
tell Xerxes that Sparta...

238
00:11:51.677 --> 00:11:53.645
is not for them,
so, whatever you do...

239
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.374
don't kick him
into the pit of death.

240
00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:57.973
Stop kicking people
into the pit of death. Really!

241
00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:00.812
WOMAN:
# Oh, no #

242
00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.513
# Oh, yeah #

243
00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:05.113
# Uh-huh, yeah. #

244
00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:06.385
I don't know why y'all...

245
00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.723
have to always get on
my back for everything.

246
00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:10.386
I'm a responsible adult.

247
00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:12.488
Look at me-
I'm booby-feeding my baby.

248
00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.396
Sometimes I like to
give him fried milk.

249
00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:15.661
I call 'em milk poppers.

250
00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:16.963
It's just like breast milk,
but it's fried.

251
00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:18.264
And you just pop 'em in your mouth.

252
00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:19.395
He loves 'em.
Don't you, baby!

253
00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:21.633
# Goo-goo, gah-gah #

254
00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:24.574
# Gah-gah, gah-gah-gah-gah. #

255
00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:26.543
(raspy panting)

256
00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:28.341
I'm a smart shopper.

257
00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:31.247
I got this entire outfit in
an alleyway from a Mexico woman.

258
00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:32.443
# Bargain #

259
00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:33.678
# Shopping #

260
00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.050
#Yeah. #

261
00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:36.679
Why do y'all think I'm messed up?

262
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.247
Shit! Do I look crazy to you?

263
00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:47.231
(echoing): Oh...

264
00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:49.995
my God!

265
00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:51.829
Aw, damn, cuz!

266
00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:53.303
There goes my palimony!

267
00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:54.964
K-Fed ain't havin' it, yo.

268
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.372
K-Fed, come back to me, please!

269
00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.843
Please? I'll let you under my skirt.

270
00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:01.539
There goes K-Fed's cheddar, yo.

271
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.309
(screaming)

272
00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.050
MAN:
# Oh, yeah! #

273
00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:09.315
#Ah-ah-ah, yeah! #

274
00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:12.824
(singing off-key):
# Ooh-ooh-ooh! #

275
00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:14.189
(screeching):
#Yeah! #

276
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.852
(sobbing)

277
00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:16.895
#Yeah! #

278
00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:17.986
(shrieks)

279
00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:22.056
# I'm not gay! #

280
00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:23.895
(groans)

281
00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:26.267
Leonidas.

282
00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:27.566
Ryan Seacrest?

283
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.337
How did you feel about that kick?

284
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.004
Let's see what the judges
have to say.

285
00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:36.013
- Randy?
- Yo, Leo, dawg, man...

286
00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:38.879
I, I wasn't really feelin' you
on that kick, dawg.

287
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:40.851
I don't know what happened, man.

288
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.717
It was just
all right for me, dawg.

289
00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:45.450
- I mean, just all right, dawg.
- Paula?

290
00:13:45.524 --> 00:13:49.255
Leonidas...

291
00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:51.853
you...

292
00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:53.694
move me.

293
00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:55.427
(voice breaking):
Y-

294
00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:58.966
I don't-

295
00:13:59.038 --> 00:13:59.970
Simon?

296
00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.097
Leonidas...

297
00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:03.641
I thought the kick...

298
00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:07.042
was utterly... dreadful.

299
00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:08.136
Oh... Simon-

300
00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:09.579
In fact, I've seen better kicks...

301
00:14:09.648 --> 00:14:11.275
from a geriatric donkey.

302
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.442
Oh- (sputters)

303
00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.543
And I'm not talking
about you, Paula.

304
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.054
I am sorry, King...

305
00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:21.525
but your journey ends here.

306
00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:24.660
Oh, go (bleep) yourselves!

307
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.893
- What are y?
- (judges screaming)

308
00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:30.401
(screams echoing)

309
00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:40.845
(sniveling)

310
00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:42.904
(whimpering)

311
00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:53.186
(echoing): Seacrest out!

312
00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:55.284
Excellent work, my king.

313
00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:58.728
It's time to consult
with the prophets.

314
00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:01.391
(sighs)

315
00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:09.240
(screams echoing)

316
00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:15.372
NARRATOR:
<i>The ancient prophets were advisers to the king.</i>

317
00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:20.908
<i>Grotesque swine, their consult</i>
<i>came with a bribe.</i>

318
00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:24.213
(excited grunting)

319
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.191
Oh. Oh, Oxy 10.

320
00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:29.352
Oh, Neutrogena.

321
00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:30.895
This has an SPF.

322
00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.225
Th-This is all-day protection.

323
00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:33.856
Look at this.

324
00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.525
Exfoliator with alpha hydroxy.

325
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.568
This is good for you, Glenn.

326
00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:38.603
Rub it all over
your disgusting face.

327
00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:43.569
What need you, King Leonidas?

328
00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:45.075
Ancient prophets...

329
00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:47.044
I need your guidance.

330
00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:50.741
I'm assembling an army
of 300 to go to war with Persia.

331
00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:55.185
I'm going to take them in the rear.

332
00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:57.484
Here, here.

333
00:15:57.556 --> 00:15:58.545
(snickers)

334
00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.524
And then I'm gonna reach around...

335
00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:01.684
(chuckles)

336
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.785
...and I'm gonna take them again
from the front!

337
00:16:03.862 --> 00:16:04.920
(snickering)

338
00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:05.929
What?!

339
00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:07.295
Why are you sniggering?!

340
00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:09.061
Nothing.

341
00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:10.658
It's- no-nothing-

342
00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:11.668
- (clears throat)
- (snickering continues)

343
00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:13.034
What's so damn funny?!

344
00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:15.039
Look, it's all there for you to see!

345
00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:16.438
These are battle formations!

346
00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:17.440
(chuckling): Battle form-

347
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:18.635
That's what he calls them!

348
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:22.203
It looks like backstage
at an Elton John concert!

349
00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:23.441
Cut it out!
This isn't funny!

350
00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:25.005
This is serious business!

351
00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:26.073
(moans)

352
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:28.312
No Spartan goes to war...

353
00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:30.617
without first consulting...

354
00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:32.850
the oracle!

355
00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.955
(ethereal, ominous music plays)

356
00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:55.403
NARRATOR:
<i>The prophets chose only the most beautiful...</i>

357
00:16:55.481 --> 00:17:00.544
<i>of Spartan girls to be their oracle.</i>

358
00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:04.316
Oh-

359
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.085
Ugly Betty?

360
00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:08.558
She has a great personality.

361
00:17:08.627 --> 00:17:10.026
##

362
00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:13.190
Eww!

363
00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:14.630
I look likeJabba the Hutt.

364
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.065
That is hot to me.

365
00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:18.330
(sneezing)

366
00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:20.736
(exotic techno melody playing)

367
00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:29.103
(slurping)

368
00:17:35.854 --> 00:17:37.412
Oh-

369
00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:39.950
(whispering): See-nah skah-nah...

370
00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:43.290
labwana no-cho dame.

371
00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:46.763
"Fo' shizel my nizzel."

372
00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:49.768
(indistinct whispering)

373
00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:53.271
"Save the cheerleader...
save the world."

374
00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:56.068
Actually, I'm, I'm not into <i>Heroes.</i>

375
00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:58.234
"Douche bag says what?"

376
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.106
What?

377
00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:00.577
(snickering)

378
00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:02.773
(prophets snickering)

379
00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:03.780
(whispering indistinctly)

380
00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:05.407
"Chest waxer says what?"

381
00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:06.382
- What?
- (snickering)

382
00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:07.646
(chortling)

383
00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:10.381
(chuckling):
He walked into that one.

384
00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:12.651
What, what are you saying to me?
I don't understand.

385
00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:15.989
Go to war with Persia
and you will surely die.

386
00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:21.656
You're screwed, dude.

387
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.362
(exotic, ethereal theme plays)

388
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:46.789
(women laughing)

389
00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:47.883
What?!

390
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.689
(laughter continuing)

391
00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:54.566
He looks like a Ken doll!

392
00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:58.262
(laughter continues)

393
00:18:58.337 --> 00:18:59.599
It's cold!

394
00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:20.590
Tommy Lee?

395
00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:26.297
Shaq?

396
00:19:30.035 --> 00:19:31.434
Borat?

397
00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:34.071
(whispering): Oakland Raiders?

398
00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:41.377
Why is my king so restless?

399
00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:44.745
Can't sleep.

400
00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:48.684
It's this whole Battle
ofThermopylae thing.

401
00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:52.656
Are you still thinking about
what that young oracle said?

402
00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:54.157
(sighs)

403
00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:56.990
There's only one woman whose
words you should listen to.

404
00:19:58.263 --> 00:19:59.321
Oprah.

405
00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:00.695
Your wife?

406
00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:02.859
Right, right.

407
00:20:02.935 --> 00:20:05.130
How will I be tried...

408
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.796
in the court of public opinion?

409
00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:11.837
Well, Harry Knowles
at "Ain't It Cool News"...

410
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.471
says this movie is just
a cheap rip-off of <i>300.</i>

411
00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:20.775
(woman laughing)

412
00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:22.183
- (grunts)
- (other women gasp)

413
00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:25.018
Even if the oracle
doesn't support you, I do.

414
00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.388
And Sparta does.

415
00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:29.484
This could be
our last night together.

416
00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:32.154
You wanna do it?

417
00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:34.131
Like we've never done it before.

418
00:20:34.199 --> 00:20:36.360
(exhales)

419
00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:42.799
(passionate, breathy moaning)

420
00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:57.379
(sighs)

421
00:20:57.456 --> 00:21:00.823
...97... 98...

422
00:21:00.892 --> 00:21:03.360
...99...

423
00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:04.986
(grunting):100!

424
00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:08.123
Beat my record.

425
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.428
- (grunts)
- (shrieks)

426
00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:15.398
Captain.

427
00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:16.736
My king.

428
00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:26.044
Have you assembled
my army who are ready...

429
00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:28.985
to fight to the death
for the freedom of Sparta?

430
00:21:29.054 --> 00:21:30.180
Yes, King.

431
00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:39.159
I wanted 300.

432
00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:41.995
This seems like... less.

433
00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:44.001
These were the only men
who met with your stringent...

434
00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:46.003
specifications.

435
00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:48.335
"Hunky with deep
Mediterranean tans...

436
00:21:48.407 --> 00:21:49.806
"hot bods..."

437
00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:51.775
and, uh...

438
00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:52.673
Yes?

439
00:21:52.744 --> 00:21:54.006
"...well endowed."

440
00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:55.341
SPARTANS: Haawoo! Haawoo!

441
00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:56.540
Haawoo!

442
00:21:56.615 --> 00:21:58.173
Ready to fight for you, my king!

443
00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.218
Never give up!
Never surrender!

444
00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:03.448
To infinity and beyond!

445
00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:07.751
CAPTAI N:
He has a lot of heart, my king.

446
00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:09.487
And nice man boobs.

447
00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:16.593
Indeed.

448
00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:18.932
These men will do.

449
00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:22.872
You are a fine captain, Captain.

450
00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:26.104
But a better friend...
there is none.

451
00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:27.805
Thank you.

452
00:22:40.058 --> 00:22:42.686
Thank you.

453
00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:43.989
Thank you.

454
00:22:44.062 --> 00:22:45.120
Mm-hm.

455
00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.129
Damn!

456
00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:50.401
He's got a huge package.

457
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.004
I brought you some fudge.
Mom said that you like to pack it.

458
00:22:58.076 --> 00:22:59.805
She's a good woman.

459
00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:01.971
Good-bye, Father.

460
00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:03.409
(sighs): Farewell, my son.

461
00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:05.143
(Leonidas clears throat)

462
00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:07.412
Introductions?

463
00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:09.818
King Leonidas,
this is my son, Sonio.

464
00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:11.412
My king.

465
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.924
Why is he not fighting?

466
00:23:13.992 --> 00:23:15.186
Well, he is not a warrior.

467
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.454
And he's my only son...

468
00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:18.996
destined to carry on my name.

469
00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:22.190
What do you think?

470
00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:24.360
Yummy.

471
00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:26.427
Work it, sister.

472
00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:28.598
I think he's fierce.

473
00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:29.935
(rap beat plays)

474
00:23:30.008 --> 00:23:31.566
# Come and give it 2 me #

475
00:23:31.643 --> 00:23:34.544
#You know you want my body,
need my body #

476
00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:35.841
# Show me them goodies... #

477
00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:37.176
And if you don't like it...

478
00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:39.774
you can kiss my fat ass!

479
00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:41.978
(smacks)

480
00:23:42.053 --> 00:23:43.020
Ooh!
Oh!

481
00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:44.020
#... Watchin' your curves #

482
00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.078
#Thinking of words, baby #

483
00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:46.124
# My vision is blurred... #

484
00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:48.182
Congratulations, Sonio.

485
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.319
You're now on your way
to becoming Sparta's...

486
00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:51.828
(whispering): Next top warrior!

487
00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:52.864
#... right where my mind is #

488
00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:54.592
# Gimme your goody
and your body #

489
00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:55.894
# Uh! Come and give it 2 me #

490
00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:58.231
#You know you want my body,
need my body #

491
00:23:58.303 --> 00:23:59.930
# Show me them goodies #

492
00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:03.065
#You're gonna love my body,
touch my body... #

493
00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:04.836
QUEEN MARGO: Spartan!

494
00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:15.052
(sighs): My child...

495
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.384
I shall never forget you.

496
00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:19.788
You are so small now...

497
00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:23.191
but one day you will grow
to be big and strong...

498
00:24:23.261 --> 00:24:24.558
like your father.

499
00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:25.994
That's not your son.

500
00:24:27.632 --> 00:24:29.497
You asshole.

501
00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:38.366
Take care of your mother.

502
00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:43.505
Stay tough, Son.

503
00:24:49.488 --> 00:24:51.388
Come back with your shield...

504
00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:53.287
or on it.

505
00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:56.885
And if I come back on it,
I want you to move on.

506
00:24:56.962 --> 00:24:58.930
I would never.

507
00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:01.090
Hell, if you died,
I'd play the field.

508
00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:02.690
To be honest...

509
00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:06.203
I've always wanted
to do a fat chick.

510
00:25:15.814 --> 00:25:17.805
(gentle theme plays)

511
00:25:28.059 --> 00:25:30.050
##

512
00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:36.601
The men are ready, my king.

513
00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:39.933
Good. We'll head south
to the Hot Gates...

514
00:25:40.005 --> 00:25:42.269
where we'll intercept
the Persian army.

515
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.705
Where are you going?

516
00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:46.744
The oracle said if we went
to war, we'd be screwed.

517
00:25:46.811 --> 00:25:51.373
The oracle also said that
our painted-on abs look fake.

518
00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:53.314
But I beg to differ.

519
00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:57.651
(spray nozzle hissing)

520
00:25:57.722 --> 00:25:59.815
(giggling)

521
00:26:01.993 --> 00:26:04.086
Give the order, Captain.

522
00:26:05.163 --> 00:26:07.757
- (keypad beeping)
- Spartans! In formation!

523
00:26:07.832 --> 00:26:09.163
OTHERS: Ah-ooh!

524
00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:12.101
(whispering) Spartans heading south.

525
00:26:19.878 --> 00:26:21.175
Move out!

526
00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.976
(lively disco beat plays)

527
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:25.573
SPARTANS:
# Oh, no, not I #

528
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.379
# I will survive #

529
00:26:27.452 --> 00:26:30.216
# Oh, as long
as I know how to love #

530
00:26:30.288 --> 00:26:32.119
# I know I'll stay alive #

531
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.021
# I've got all my life to live #

532
00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:36.151
# I've got all
my love to give #

533
00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:37.888
#And I'll survive #

534
00:26:37.963 --> 00:26:40.158
# I will survive #

535
00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:42.028
# Hey, hey #

536
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.727
Woo!

537
00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:45.793
(melody continues)

538
00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:54.544
WOMAN:
# I'll survive #

539
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:56.478
# I will survive #

540
00:26:56.548 --> 00:26:58.675
# I will survive! #

541
00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.342
#Yeah #

542
00:27:00.418 --> 00:27:01.476
# Ooh... #

543
00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:03.180
NARRATOR: <i>The fearless Spartans...</i>

544
00:27:03.254 --> 00:27:05.950
<i>reached the Hot Gates...</i>

545
00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:09.687
<i>where danger lurked</i>
<i>around every corner.</i>

546
00:27:09.894 --> 00:27:11.521
(ominous theme plays)

547
00:27:11.596 --> 00:27:14.394
Halt skipping!

548
00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:16.661
(exhausted groans)

549
00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:20.070
<i>Exhausted from thejourney...</i>

550
00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:24.040
<i>the Spartans replenished</i>

551
00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:27.010
(exciting, dramatic music playing)

552

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:36.215
(music finishes with a flourish)

554
00:27:36.287 --> 00:27:39.188
(chomping, grunting)

555
00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:42.425
What do you think, my king?

556
00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:45.122
We'll use the narrow
passageway of the Hot Gates...

557
00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:46.993
to funnel the Persians in...

558
00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:50.466
where their vast numbers
won't count for shit.

559
00:27:50.535 --> 00:27:53.060
Captain, have the men found
any other trails...

560
00:27:53.138 --> 00:27:55.538
that the Persians
could use to attack us?

561
00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:57.040
None, sir.

562
00:27:57.108 --> 00:28:00.635
WOMAN (in low, distorted voice):
I know such a road, my king.

563
00:28:07.552 --> 00:28:09.986
Back off, hideous creature.

564
00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:12.216
There's a secret goat path
just above the Hot Gates.

565
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.884
If the Persians found it,
they could outflank you.

566
00:28:14.959 --> 00:28:16.426
Slow your roll, Captain.

567
00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:20.287
Reveal yourself, creature.

568
00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:25.329
Paris Hilton?

569
00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:26.427
Hey, fellas.

570
00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:27.994
What happened to you?

571
00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:30.564
(chuckles): Oh.
You mean the hump?

572
00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:33.167
Yeah. The hump.

573
00:28:33.244 --> 00:28:35.007
It was all that,
"You're going to jail.

574
00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.604
"Now you can get out of jail.

575
00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:37.978
Now you're going back to jail."

576
00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:41.314
And on and on and on and on- Ugh.

577
00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:43.081
It's just been really confusing.

578
00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:45.213
I mean, even Tinkerbell's
affected by it.

579
00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:46.655
She hasn't moved since Saturday.

580
00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:48.625
But she still poops, which is weird.

581
00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:50.251
(sighs): And me...

582
00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:52.956
they've turned me into this, like...

583
00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:55.625
totally grotesque monster!

584
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.668
(crying): And I don't
even know... oh.

585
00:28:57.736 --> 00:28:59.761
(hip-hop ringtone plays):
# Do tha hump-de-hump... #

586
00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:01.829
Hang on a minute.

587
00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:05.171
Oh- (groans)

588
00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:07.268
Hello?

589
00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:08.505
Oh, hey, Nicole.

590
00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.514
Nothing. Just some guys with swords.

591
00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.709
No, I'm talking about their
actual swords, Nicole.

592
00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:14.046
You're gross.

593
00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:15.711
Yeah, I'm hungry.
Did you eat?

594
00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:17.152
Oh, you ate an almond?

595
00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:19.315
Oh, yeah, you're done
eating for the day.

596
00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.325
Okay. And then let's go to Pinkberry.

597
00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:23.553
Bye, sexy.

598
00:29:23.628 --> 00:29:24.617

Look...

601
00:29:27.232 --> 00:29:29.666
it's my dream to be a Spartan.

602
00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:35.036
I want to fight for you,
my king.

603
00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:41.545
- What can you do?
- Well- Mmm.

604
00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:45.276
Have you seen my video?

605
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.683
I don't like the way
you handle a spear.

606
00:29:48.753 --> 00:29:51.551
You grip the shaft firmly.

607
00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.750
Then with one hand on the base...

608
00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:57.124
you slide the other
all the way up to the tip.

609
00:29:58.296 --> 00:30:01.060
That's hot.

610
00:30:03.234 --> 00:30:05.759
I'm sorry,
but we cannot use you.

611
00:30:05.837 --> 00:30:07.668
(groans, pants)

612
00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:08.967
No!

613
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.235
It's not fair!

614
00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:14.904
Mom!

615
00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:21.349
You'll be sorry!
You're making a terrible mistake!

come to accept your surrender.

628

and get yourself a whistle and #

732
00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:37.267

- (groaning) Eee! Ooh!

733
00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:38.563
(grunts)

734
00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:40.035
(crack)

735
00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:41.366
(exhales)

736
00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:42.906
You got served!

737
00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:45.007
(cheers, shouts, whooping)

738
00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:48.239
(lively swing music plays)

739
00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:52.572

740
00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:55.379

741
00:35:57.355 --> 00:36:00.153
(crowd cheering, whistling)

742
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:04.788
You telling me we lost?

743
00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:07.023
Dance them to the cliffs!

744
00:36:07.098 --> 00:36:08.793
LEONI DAS: No mercy!

745
00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:10.390
Come on, man,
can we talk about this?

746
00:36:10.468 --> 00:36:11.958
Yo, I just met
these dudes right here.

747
00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:12.968
I don't even know them.

748
00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:16.336
CAPTAI N: Onward! Keep dancing, boys!

749
00:36:16.407 --> 00:36:18.034
(fierce yell)

750
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:20.077
(echoing scream)

751
00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:23.413
(shrieking)

752
00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:26.473
(ominous, dramatic theme plays)

753
00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:37.022
- Last one in is a rotten egg!
- Cannonball!

754
00:36:37.094 --> 00:36:38.254
Marco!

755
00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:41.492
(splash)

756
00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:44.160
(echoing): Polo!

757
00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:45.532
(splash)

758
00:36:45.603 --> 00:36:47.400
ALL: Hyah!

759
00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:48.096
(scattered laughter)

760
00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:53.004
We may have won the battle,
but they will win the war!

761
00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:54.510
ALL: Hyah! What?

762
00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:55.739
##

763
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.811
MALE ANNOUNCER:
Buttmeister presents...

764
00:36:57.882 --> 00:36:59.907
"Real Men of Genius."

765
00:36:59.984 --> 00:37:02.509
MALE SI NGER:
# Real men of genius! #

766
00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:04.020
Today we salute you...

767
00:37:04.088 --> 00:37:06.556
Mr. Warmongering Latent Homosexual.

768
00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:10.025
# Mr. Warmongering
Latent Homosexual! #

769
00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:12.426
Wearing nothing but
leather underwear and a cape...

770
00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:15.522
you charge your enemy like
an oiled-up hairless wonder.

771
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.592
# Spray-on tan! #

772
00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:20.034
Sure, there's danger-

773
00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:22.072
charging rhinos,
stampeding elephants...

774
00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:26.098
and that cute toga-wearing guy
named Chad.

775
00:37:26.177 --> 00:37:27.474
# Ooh! #

776
00:37:27.545 --> 00:37:29.240
You only went out on one date...

777
00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:30.541
but you'll remember it...

778
00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:32.583
(echoing): Forever, forever...

779
00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:35.551
#Take your daily Valtrex! #

780
00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.714
Your keen instincts tell you
to cut, slice and chop...

781
00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:40.416
every man you see.

782
00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:43.119
But enough about your career
as a hair stylist...

783
00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:44.923
let's talk war.

784
00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:47.624
# Ow! That curling
iron is hot! #

785
00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:50.166
So this Butt's for you,
King Leonidas...

786
00:37:50.234 --> 00:37:52.065
because when the going gets tough...

787
00:37:52.136 --> 00:37:53.797
the tough go antiquing.

788
00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:58.308
# Mr. Warmongering
Latent Homosexual... #

789
00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:01.510
#Yeah. #

790
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.404
Queen Margo...

791
00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:06.507
we must speak.

792
00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:08.074
(exhales)

793
00:38:08.152 --> 00:38:10.382
Loyalist, what do you want?

794
00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.524
Nice tomatoes.

795
00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:18.153
Your husband needs you.

796
00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:19.992
(sighs)

797
00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.691
You must convince the council...

798
00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:24.166
to send more troops
to support your husband.

799
00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:25.725
My husband is dead.

800
00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.566
He told me to move on.

801
00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:30.539
Besides, I'm already
registered on J Date.

802
00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:32.235
A little to the right.

803
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.709
- (soft crunching)
- That's it.

804
00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:36.474
If Leonidas fails,
Xerxes will take over...

805
00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:39.175
and you will be stripped
of your crown.

806
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.684
I won't be queen?

807
00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:43.845
- (masseuse grunts)
- Ow! That's too hard.

808
00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:45.684
You will lose everything.

809
00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:47.747
Ow! Ooh, stop.

810
00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:50.191
Your palace, your Mercedes...

811
00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:51.387
Hi-yah!

812
00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:53.259
- Ow!
...your Nintendo Wii...

813
00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:54.423
- (grunts)
- No, no, no, no, no.

814
00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:55.590
- (grunts)
- Ow!

815
00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:58.032
...your vaginal regeneration surgeon...

816
00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.364
Hi... yah!

817
00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:00.699
...your gardener.

818
00:39:00.771 --> 00:39:01.567
(gasps)

819
00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:05.604
Antonio?

820
00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:09.073
(leaf blower whirring)

821
00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:11.637
(lively Latin disco music playing)

822
00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:12.978
(passionate sigh)

823
00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.541
(music continues)

824
00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:19.255
(kisses, blows)

825
00:39:21.525 --> 00:39:23.322
My husband needs me.

826
00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:24.986
I'll do whatever it takes.

827
00:39:25.062 --> 00:39:26.222
I will set...

828
00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:28.026
the meeting with the council.

829
00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:29.999
But in order to win their vote...

830
00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:32.934
you will need to get
Traitoro's support.

831
00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:37.336
He holds great influence...

832
00:39:37.408 --> 00:39:39.171
with the council.

833
00:39:39.243 --> 00:39:40.437
(masseuse yells)

834
00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:43.139
QUEEN MARGO:
There better be a happy ending.

835
00:39:43.347 --> 00:39:45.747
(indistinct chatter)

836
00:39:52.923 --> 00:39:55.118
King Leonidas!

837
00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:56.784
Xerxes approaches.

838
00:39:57.828 --> 00:39:59.159
NARRATOR: <i>Xerxes.</i>

839
00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:02.461
<i>He looked a lot like</i>
<i>that fat guy from</i> Borat.

840
00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:05.627
(exotic theme plays)

841
00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:11.202
I am the great god-king Xerxes.

842
00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:12.435
- (loud rip)
- Ooh!

843
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.340
ALL: Ooh!

844
00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:16.312
(groans, hisses in pain)

845
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.779
Ow, ow, ow!

846
00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:19.611
Not again!
That always happens.

847
00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:22.443
- (stapler clacks)
- OTHERS: Ow!

848
00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.953
(groans)

849
00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:25.454
(stapler clatters)

850
00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:26.615
Whew!

851
00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:30.120
(exhales sharply)

852
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.392
- (cracking)
- (men groaning)

853
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.528
(yells, thuds)

854
00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:41.866
ALL: Damn!

855
00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:46.737
- Oh, s-sorry, Xerxes.
- It's cool.

856
00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:48.506
It's cool, cool. I'm fine.

857
00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:50.570
I meant to do that.
(chuckles)

858
00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:51.842
- (gunshot)
- (grunts)

859
00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:53.247
ALL: Oh, shit!

860
00:40:53.317 --> 00:40:54.944
I'll tell you, kid, you got balls.

861
00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:56.611
I come over here with a big army.

862
00:40:56.687 --> 00:40:58.245
We going to shish kebab your ass.

863
00:40:58.322 --> 00:41:00.984
Before this battle is over...

864
00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:02.650
people will know...

865
00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:04.751
that even a god-king can fall.

866
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:07.354
Listen, Leo, I came here to talk.

867
00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:09.763
Just listen to my deal.

868
00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:13.830
Ladies!

869
00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:16.338
WOMEN: Hi, Xerxes.

870
00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:17.704
(laughter)

871
00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:20.073
- (phone ringing)
- Ah, that's probably for me.

872
00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:22.372
Hello?

873
00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:24.038
Really?

874
00:41:24.114 --> 00:41:26.082
Okay.

875
00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:28.345
That was the banker.

876
00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:29.613
He's offering...

877
00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:31.712
to buy back your briefcase...

878
00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:33.882
for a weekend getaway for two...

879
00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:36.051
in Las Vegas, Nevada...

880
00:41:36.126 --> 00:41:37.753
at the Palms Hotel and Casino!

881
00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:39.386
WOMEN: Ooh...

882
00:41:39.463 --> 00:41:40.725
I've always wanted to go there!

883
00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:44.199
All you have to do
is bow down to me...

884
00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:47.363
...and surrender Sparta.

885
00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.033
Deal...

886
00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:51.597
or no deal?

887
00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:52.972
(Spartans shouting advice)

888
00:41:53.043 --> 00:41:54.601
- Deal!
- Deal!
- Take it!

889
00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:55.940
Take the deal!

890
00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:57.605
You think I should? No!

891
00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:58.841
- Take the deal!
- It's simple.

892
00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:00.144
- Take the deal!
- Come on!

893
00:42:00.217 --> 00:42:01.616
What about Sparta?

894
00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:02.709
- Hit the button!
- Come on!

895
00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:04.754
WOMEN: Take the deal! Take it!

896
00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:06.619
- Take it!
- Take the deal!

897
00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:07.782
Hit the button!

898
00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:09.621
(shouting continues)

899
00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:10.489
Take it!

900
00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:13.257
No deal!

901
00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.764
- (groans, angry grunts)
- Oh, great!

902
00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:18.063
By the time I'm finished with you...

903
00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:20.103
Sparta will be annihilated.

904
00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.798
It will be as though
you never existed.

905
00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.602
I will see to it that you are...

906
00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:26.165
written out of the history books.

907
00:42:27.511 --> 00:42:30.947
Well, that's fine by me, Xerxes...

908
00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:33.483
because I can't read.

909
00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:35.584
(slow, ominous theme plays)

910
00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:39.020
NARRATOR:
<i>Xerxes didn't take rejection well.</i>

911
00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:42.183
<i>From every corner ofhis empire...</i>

912
00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:45.422
<i>he sent his most</i>
<i>vicious warriors to fight.</i>

913
00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:47.896
Yo mama's so ghetto,
when she breast-feeds...

914
00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.933
Kool-Aid comes out!

915
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.264
(derisive shouts, laughter)

916
00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:59.601
Yo mama's so stupid,
she thought Tupac Shakur...

917
00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:01.645
was a Jewish holiday!

918
00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:04.442
(derisive shouts, laughter)

919
00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:06.642
(clucking like a chicken)

920
00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:10.512
Get her, Dilio!

921
00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:14.024
Yo mama's so fat, her
pants size is, um, um, um...

922
00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:15.854
"Bitch, lose some weight"!

923
00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:17.655
(laughter, shouts)

924
00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:18.956
Your mama's so butch...

925
00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:21.054
Rosie O'Donnell
wouldn't even date her.

926
00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:23.725
Uh-uh! No, you didn't!
No, you didn't!

927
00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:25.132
- Whoa!
- No, you didn't!

928
00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:28.228
Well, yo mama titties
is smaller than yours.

929
00:43:28.305 --> 00:43:31.138
(others hooting)

930
00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:33.472
Bounce some D's on that bitch!

931
00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:36.138
Your mama's so fat,
Sir Mix-A-lot decided...

932
00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:37.908
he doesn't like big butts!

933
00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:40.382
And he ain't lyin'!
Kiss that!

934
00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:43.644
Oh! Ow!

935
00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:45.188
Oh, my eyes!

936
00:43:45.255 --> 00:43:47.416
Oh! Oh!

937
00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:48.651
LEONI DAS: Walk it off.

938
00:43:48.726 --> 00:43:50.023
- How you like that, huh?
- Sit down.

939
00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:55.327
Yo, yo mama's so fat,
that when she farts...

940
00:43:55.399 --> 00:43:57.959
Al Gore accuses her
of global warming, dawg.

941
00:43:58.035 --> 00:43:59.195
Whew!

942
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:01.601
Cranking it up!

943
00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:05.472
Yes, well, that may be the case,
but your mama's so hairy...

944
00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:07.373
the only language she speaks...

945
00:44:07.444 --> 00:44:09.071
is Wookiee!

946
00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:11.410
- (roars like a Wookiee)
- (laughter) Oh!

947
00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.915
(roaring like a Wookiee)

948
00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:14.712
That's it!

949
00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:16.116
- Well, yo mama-
- (imitates Wookiee roar)

950
00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:17.676
Yo ma-

951
00:44:19.023 --> 00:44:20.888
- (roaring like a Wookiee)
- (Spartans laughing, talking)

952
00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:22.016
Yes!

953
00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:23.753
- (Spartans hooting)
- CAPTAI N: Bye-bye!

954
00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:25.419
Back to the hood!

955
00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:28.897
<i>Xerxes watched</i>
<i>as his warriors were defeated.</i>

956
00:44:28.966 --> 00:44:32.629
<i>It sent an all-too-human chill</i>
<i>up his spine.</i>

957
00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:35.638
<i>Or perhaps that was</i>
<i>the Dentyne Ice...</i>

958
00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:37.401
<i>with cool mint crystals.</i>

959
00:44:37.474 --> 00:44:39.965
(crackling)

960
00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:48.779
Loyalist said you wanted to see me.

961
00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:52.283
That's my urine sample.

962
00:44:54.658 --> 00:44:55.989
Tastes like asparagus.

963
00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.823
Leonidas needs more troops.

964
00:44:57.895 --> 00:45:02.559
Without reinforcements,
Sparta will fall and-

965
00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:04.760
(horn playing quiet mock gibberish)

966
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.662
(horn continues playing mock gibberish)

967
00:45:11.742 --> 00:45:13.471
I'll do anything...

968
00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:16.104
(softly): For my husband.

969
00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.841
Anything?

970
00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:22.177
(exhales seductively)

971
00:45:22.252 --> 00:45:23.844
- (boinging)
- Awesome!

972
00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.479
I'm so getting laid!

973
00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:28.024
Good-bye, virginity.

974
00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:30.356
I promise you,
you're not going to enjoy this.

975
00:45:30.427 --> 00:45:33.089
But I suffer from premature eja-

976
00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:37.128
Oh-

977
00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:38.361
Mmm.

978
00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:40.869
It's okay; I have crabs.

979
00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:45.635
(playing melody)

980
00:45:51.381 --> 00:45:53.542
(both giggle)

981
00:45:58.255 --> 00:46:00.314
WOMAN:
Ooh- (laughs)

982
00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:06.851
(percussive music continues)

983
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:09.023
(woman's echoing laughter)

984
00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:12.364
XERXES:
Betray your beloved Spartans-

985
00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:18.140
Nice.

986
00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:23.012
And I will give you
anything you desire.

987
00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.604
That's hot.

988
00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:26.478
Bow down to me.

989
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.609
(barking)

990
00:46:28.685 --> 00:46:30.949
Bow down to the great god-king...

991
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.682
Xerxes.

992
00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:34.348
I'm a Hilton.

993
00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:35.948
I don't bow.

994
00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:37.288
(exasperated groan)

995
00:46:37.361 --> 00:46:38.760
But I do bend over.

996
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:40.956
Ah, good.

997
00:46:41.031 --> 00:46:43.864
There's a secret goat path
into the Hot Gates.

998
00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:47.165
You could totally use it
to defeat Leonidas.

999
00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:50.263
Ah- (laughs)

1000
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.604
And what do you desire?

1001
00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:54.837
I want my record expunged.

1002
00:46:55.879 --> 00:46:57.676
Oh, and I want
that new Chanel purse.

1003
00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:00.509
Thank you.

1004
00:47:00.584 --> 00:47:03.314
I want throwing up to be fun.

1005
00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:05.981
You got something to say,
say it- I got things to do.

1006
00:47:06.056 --> 00:47:08.115
(quietly): What was it?

1007
00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:09.489
I can't remem-

1008
00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.289
Oh, God, geez, yeah.
(groans)

1009
00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:13.158
I want to get this hump removed.

1010
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:16.063
(chuckles)

1011
00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:21.866
Mmm!

1012
00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:31.105
Will you please just do it?
It's really heavy and really hard to keep clean.

1013
00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:33.376
Done.

1014
00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:37.112
- (loud pop)
- Aah!

1015
00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:47.455
(slurping)

1016
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:48.691
(exhales)

1017
00:47:48.765 --> 00:47:50.699
As long as Xerxes doesn't find...

1018
00:47:50.767 --> 00:47:53.065
the secret path to the Hot Gates...

1019
00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:57.236
...their vast numbers
won't count for shit.

1020
00:47:57.307 --> 00:47:58.774
(panting)

1021
00:47:58.842 --> 00:48:00.275
My king!

1022
00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:04.346
Catch your breath.

1023
00:48:04.414 --> 00:48:06.245
Vanilla blended.

1024
00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:08.614
What is it, boy?

1025
00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:13.522
Xerxes has found
the secret goat path...

1026
00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:14.682
through the Hot Gates.

1027
00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:15.782
Aw, shit!

1028
00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:18.157
Damn that Paris Hilton.

1029
00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:20.093
(panting): I hate her.

1030
00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:21.653
He's deployed thousands
of Persian soldiers...

1031
00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:22.994
that'll be here any minute.

1032
00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:25.057
(panting)

1033
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.367
(slurps)

1034
00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:32.272
Dilio...

1035
00:48:32.342 --> 00:48:33.832
how bad are your injuries?

1036
00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:37.142
Oh, it's, uh- it's
just a scratch, my king.

1037
00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:39.944
(dramatic, eerie theme plays)

1038
00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:42.983
You've got no eyes.

1039
00:48:43.053 --> 00:48:45.453
The gods blessed me with a spare.

1040
00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:47.114
No, they haven't.

1041
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:48.919
You just had the two.

1042
00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:50.926
Jeremy has the spare.

1043
00:48:55.699 --> 00:48:58.224
I can still fight!

1044
00:48:58.302 --> 00:48:59.963
(grunting)

1045
00:49:00.037 --> 00:49:00.969
Whoa! No!

1046
00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:02.562
- Dilio! Dilio!
- (shouting angrily)

1047
00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:06.666
- Di- Dilio! Dilio! Dilio.
- (shouting)

1048
00:49:06.743 --> 00:49:08.142
Walk with me.

1049
00:49:09.813 --> 00:49:11.804
No. No. No.

1050
00:49:15.052 --> 00:49:17.885
Your fate is the most important.

1051
00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:23.086
You must go back to Sparta...

1052
00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.593
and tell of our tale.

1053
00:49:24.661 --> 00:49:26.822
Yes, my king.

1054
00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:29.127
Any message for the queen?

1055
00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:41.875
(wistful, gentle theme plays)

1056
00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:44.004
None that need be said.

1057
00:49:45.415 --> 00:49:47.178
Now go, Dilio.

1058
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:50.447
Tell how 13 Spartans
fought for honor...

1059
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.512
for glory...
for freedom!

1060
00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.887
(grunts)

1061
00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:57.518
Good luck, Dilio.

1062
00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:06.529
(blades scraping)

1063
00:50:06.603 --> 00:50:10.039
(low growling)

1064
00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:11.802
(steam hissing)

1065
00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:14.537
(growling)

1066
00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:17.171
Spartans!

1067
00:50:24.454 --> 00:50:26.046
XERXES: This is your final chance.

1068
00:50:26.123 --> 00:50:29.217
Bow down to me or you will die.

1069
00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:32.625
I bow for no man!

1070
00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:39.364
Take a knee.

1071
00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:40.562
No!

1072
00:50:40.637 --> 00:50:43.231
- Curtsey.
- Enough!

1073
00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:47.570
Well, your sandal is untied.

1074
00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:50.204
Oh... thanks very much.

1075
00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.872
See?
Was that that difficult?

1076
00:50:51.948 --> 00:50:53.848
- No, wait, no!
- Ah-tah-tah-tah-tah-

1077
00:50:53.917 --> 00:50:56.249
- No, I wasn't bowing.
- No, no, no.

1078
00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:57.513
I was just doing my shoe!

1079
00:50:57.587 --> 00:50:59.919
No, you acknowledged me
as your god-king.

1080
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.854
High-five!

1081
00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:04.257
- (laughter)
- Ooh.

1082
00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:05.760
What?

1083
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:08.195
(mocking, girlish laughter)

1084
00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:10.096
What-What-What the hell is so funny?

1085
00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:11.930
- You!
- Me?

1086
00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:13.697
You greet like women.

1087
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.795
You idiots are
wearing banana hammocks...

1088
00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:16.998
and you're laughing at me?

1089
00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:18.564
Now you're pissing me off.

1090
00:51:18.642 --> 00:51:19.870
I'm getting everybody.

1091
00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:22.639
- (phone beeps)
- Hello. Where you at?

1092
00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:23.940
I know where I'm at.

1093
00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:25.777
Bring in my vast army.

1094
00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:26.941
You 13...

1095
00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:28.541
putz are no match...

1096
00:51:28.618 --> 00:51:30.210
for my massive Persian army.

1097
00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:32.016
They number in the millions!

1098
00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:39.127
That's just a blue screen.

1099
00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:40.595
Stupid.

1100
00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:42.598
It's a visual effect.

1101
00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:44.531
It's going to be digitally
inserted later.

1102
00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:47.536
And the army is quite
impressive, as you can imagine.

1103
00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:49.572
- (electronic whir)
- (warriors grunt at once)

1104
00:51:49.639 --> 00:51:54.042
(gasping)

1105
00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:55.905
Gentlemen, may I present...

1106
00:51:55.979 --> 00:51:58.345
Queen Margo.

1107
00:51:58.415 --> 00:52:02.146
(dance beat plays)

1108
00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:05.586
(indistinct chatter)

1109
00:52:05.655 --> 00:52:10.183
- (laughter)
- (whistling)

1110
00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.922
(men whooping)

1111
00:52:12.996 --> 00:52:17.933
(rhythmic vocals join beat)

1112
00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:20.799
(whooping, indistinct chatter)

1113
00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.999
Come on, baby.
I'm gettin' a chubby.

1114
00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:31.043
Boner alert. Boner alert.

1115
00:52:31.114 --> 00:52:32.979
Okay, boys, make it rain!

1116
00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:35.017
# Do the D-A-N-C-E,
1-2-3-4 fight #

1117
00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:39.784
# Stick to the B-E-A-T,
get ready to ignite #

1118
00:52:39.856 --> 00:52:43.314
#You were such a P-Y-T,
catching all the light #

1119
00:52:43.393 --> 00:52:46.885
#Just easy as A-B-C, that's how
you make it right... #

1120
00:52:46.963 --> 00:52:48.260
(music fades out)

1121
00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:49.730
(whooping and chatter fades)

1122
00:52:51.535 --> 00:52:54.231
Good councilmen...

1123
00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:55.737
I implore you.

1124
00:52:55.805 --> 00:53:00.833
Your king, my dear
husband, needs your help.

1125
00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:02.640
Sparta will fall...

1126
00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:06.011
if you don't agree
to send the rest of our army.

1127
00:53:06.082 --> 00:53:09.882
(Traitoro clapping slowly)

1128
00:53:09.953 --> 00:53:13.218
(clapping rhythmically)

1129
00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:20.663
Gentlemen, our only
hope for survival...

1130
00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:23.460
is to surrender to Xerxes
and beg for his forgiveness.

1131
00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:27.731
Do not be swayed by the words
of this common prick-tease...

1132
00:53:27.804 --> 00:53:29.897
with crabs all up in her coochie.

1133
00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:32.134
- MEN: Ooh-
- (scoffs)

1134
00:53:32.209 --> 00:53:34.404
Oh, no, you didn't.

1135
00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:36.536
Yes. Yes, I did.

1136
00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:40.379
(huffing, grunting)

1137
00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:41.747
(yells)

1138
00:53:41.818 --> 00:53:45.584
NARRATOR: <i>Queen Margo unleashed</i>
<i>a venomous rage...</i>

1139
00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:47.418
(squirming)

1140
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:51.654
<i>... much like Tobey Maguire</i>
<i>in</i> Spider-Man 3.

1141
00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:55.393
- (grunting)
- (men gasping)

1142
00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:01.136
(laughing)

1143
00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:02.569
I'm evil.

1144
00:54:08.345 --> 00:54:09.369
Made of sand.

1145
00:54:09.446 --> 00:54:12.938
(grunts)

1146
00:54:13.016 --> 00:54:14.779
(coughing)

1147
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:21.147
Ohh!

1148
00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:22.786
(growls)

1149
00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:25.919
(yells)

1150
00:54:25.996 --> 00:54:26.860
Oh, no.

1151
00:54:28.865 --> 00:54:30.196
- Ooh!
- (groaning, gasping)

1152
00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.998
(meows)

1153
00:54:36.072 --> 00:54:37.767
Oh... cute.

1154
00:54:37.841 --> 00:54:40.207
- (meows, farts)
- Gross.

1155
00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:44.505
(whooshing)

1156
00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:49.375
(laughs)

1157
00:54:51.254 --> 00:54:53.313
- What is it?
- (councilmen laughing)

1158
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:54.516
Oh! Oh!

1159
00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:57.526
Oh, God!
Oh! Oh, my God.

1160
00:54:57.594 --> 00:54:59.494
(laughing)

1161
00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:02.992
How you like me now, Sandman?

1162
00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:04.658
Oh, no.

1163
00:55:04.734 --> 00:55:06.793
(vacuum whirring)

1164
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.031
Dust-busting bitch! No!

1165
00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:13.064
(groaning, yelling)

1166
00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:16.044
(yells): No!

1167
00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:21.714
(grunting)

1168
00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:27.185
- Ah-
- (councilmen murmuring)

1169
00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:31.489
- (phone beeps)
- (gasps)

1170
00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:33.358
Well, tickle my nipples
with a feather.

1171
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.024
Xerxes is in Traitoro's top five.

1172
00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:38.090
ALL:
Grumble, grumble, grumble-

1173
00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:40.602
Traitoro was a... traitor?

1174
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:42.501
- (gasps)
- Duh!

1175
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.498
All in favor...

1176
00:55:44.574 --> 00:55:47.042
of sending more troops...
say aye.

1177
00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:51.843
ALL: Aye! Aye! Aye!
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye-

1178
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:03.959
(bowstrings creaking)

1179
00:56:14.938 --> 00:56:16.235
Spartans!

1180
00:56:16.306 --> 00:56:17.238
(all grunt)

1181
00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:19.434
(swords scraping, clanging)

1182
00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:20.942
We have you surrounded.

1183
00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:23.137
Lay down your weapons!

1184
00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:25.044
Come and get them!

1185
00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:26.776
Formation!

1186
00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:29.717
(grunting)

1187
00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:34.416
Um-

1188
00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:37.927
A Spartan always protects
another man's rear.

1189
00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:42.921
(grunts)

1190
00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:44.728
Adjust your sword, boy.

1191
00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.325
It's digging into my back.

1192
00:56:49.172 --> 00:56:50.503
But I'm not wearing my sword.

1193
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:54.503
Carry on then.

1194
00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:56.408
CAPTAI N: My son.

1195
00:56:56.479 --> 00:57:01.246
Today...
you are truly a Spartan.

1196
00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:02.306
Thanks, Father.

1197
00:57:04.687 --> 00:57:05.654
Attack!

1198
00:57:05.722 --> 00:57:08.953
(shouting, yelling)

1199
00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:11.186
Steady, Spartans!

(chuckles)

1202
00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:23.599
Remember this day, boys!

1203
00:57:23.673 --> 00:57:26.870
For today is the day you die!

1204
00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:29.503
- Huh?
- What? Huh?

1205
00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:30.273
What?

1206
00:57:30.346 --> 00:57:32.337
L- I mean they die.

1207
00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:35.213
Today's the day they die-
that's what I meant to say.

1208
00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:38.118
(shouting, whooping)

1209
00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:39.280
Go!

1210
00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:41.983
(yelling)

1211
00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:47.461
(crashing rumble)

1212
00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:55.970
Oh, what a bunch of dumb shits.

1213
00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:58.906
(groaning, grunting)

1214
00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:00.499
God, that smarts.

1215
00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:03.410
I am gonna go Hercules on your ass!

1216
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:04.469
(groaning)

1217
00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:08.483

(engine rumbles, tires squeal)

1229
00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:33.498
Ghost Rider!

(chain rattling)

1231
00:59:36.873 --> 00:59:39.433
You're going to hell.

Stop, drop and roll!

1237

No!

Yo, Sonio.

1246
01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:26.550
I'm gonna knock your block off.

1247
01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.454
- Oh, shit.
- (grunts)

1248
01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.491
Sonio!

(yells)

1250
01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:47.035
You'll pay for this, Balboa.

1251
01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.077
Go for it.

1252
01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:50.840
(grunting)

1253
01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.483
Adult diapers?

Yes!

Yes!

1266

Xerxes!

(coughing)

1268
01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:11.257
It's a- a beautiful death.

1269
01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.730
It's actually not that attractive.

1270
01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:22.728

But...

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:22.953
the joke's on them,
because they don't know...

1525

that dying in battle
is the greatest honor...

1526
01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:28.454

PRESI DENT GEORGE W. BUSH:
Look, Leonidas...

Heh-heh.

1532

Trust me, I know.

Spidey, you're fired.

How are you, Leonidas?

(chuckles): Ellen.

1542
01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:22.139
Listen, I don't know
why you're so upset.

1543
01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:23.946
You look great.
You know, the cape is great.

1544
01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:25.111
Love the... diaper.

1545
01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:26.313
L-I'd wear something very similar...

1546
01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:27.548
for Portia on Friday nights.

1547
01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:28.783
We get frisky.

1548
01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.848
Hello, Leonidas.
(laughs)

1549
01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:33.554
Wow, is it hot in here?
(laughs)

1550
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:36.757
Okay, Portia, Portia,
women, women, women.

1551
01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:38.561
Women, you like
women. (laughs)

1552
01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:39.760
I can see by your-

1553
01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:41.393
your reaction, you're not amused.

1554
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:44.462
It's the same reaction anyone
who went to see <i>Mr. Wrong</i> had.

1555
01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.906
Uh, let's play a game-
maybe we could play a game.

1556
01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:48.135
How about "Who Sneezed?"
(laughs)

1557
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.234
It's a real easy game.

1558
01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:50.744
We close our eyes
and someone sneezes...

1559
01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:52.245
and you guess who.
(laughs)

1560
01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:54.441
If it was you, you win- 'cause
obviously, you know. (laughs)

1561
01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:55.540
Listen, chill out.

1562
01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:57.278
Let's just dance, shall we? Come on.

1563
01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:59.843
- (dance music playing)
- That's right. Oh, boy.

1564
01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:01.219
(laughs): Okay.

1565
01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.621
There you go, you're
getting the hang of it.

1566
01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:05.251
- You know, back and forth-
- No, I can't do this!

1567
01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:06.658
(screams)

1568
01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.218
Yo mama's so ugly, if she was...

1569
01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:10.094
on the Spice Girls,
her name would be...

1570
01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:12.497
Dookie Spice!

1571
01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.229
Doo-doo!

1572
01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:16.100
Leonidas. (chuckling)

1573
01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:20.099
You should try Scientology.

1574
01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:22.006
I'm gonna set Katie free.

1575
01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:24.668
BOTH: Yes!

1576
01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:26.475
I had to buy
a million and one glitters...

1577
01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:28.277
with my own money,
and I had to buy-

1578
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:30.818
(quavering):
I put them on by hand, Simon...

1579
01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:34.754
and my reputation is all I have,
and for you to sit here...

1580
01:16:34.823 --> 01:16:37.451
telling me that
I'm not intennigent-

1581
01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:39.289
inte-
that I'm not intenni-

1582
01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:40.919
- Let me start over.
- Intelligent. Yeah.

1583
01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:42.156
- Hang on.
- Intelligent. Yeah.

1584
01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:44.095
- DANE COOK: I looked everywhere.
- (groans)

1585
01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:46.225
Don't you hate when you're
on an airplane, you know...

1586
01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:48.394
and the captain's, like,
"If you look out the window...

1587
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:50.267
to your left, you're gonna
see another plane"?

1588
01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:52.204
Am I right? See what
I'm talking about?

1589
01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:53.605
Another plane? Right?

1590
01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:55.165
Don't you hate when you're
in the supermarket...

1591
01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:56.608
you know, and you're in aisle three.

1592
01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:57.975
And, like, "Clean up
on aisle three."

1593
01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.536
You know? And you're, like,
"What am I doing here?"

1594
01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:01.014
I'm in aisle three, huh? Right?

1595
01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:03.517
You're all my fans, right?
You all love me, right?

1596
01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:05.052
Who saw <i>Employee of the Month?</i>

1597
01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.519
Okay, that's cool.

1598
01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:07.816
Right? Yeah, what's up, Leonidas?

1599
01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:09.686
Super fingers to you.

1600
01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:10.725
No.

1601
01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.157
(smacking, whooshing)

1602
01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:13.319
Super fingers...

1603
01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:15.192
to you, Dane Cook!

1604
01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:16.662
(grunts)

1605
01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:19.223
This is a metaphor for my career.

1606
01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:20.563
You're off my MySpace page.

1607
01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.604
I'm really 42.

1608
01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:25.196
(relieved sigh)

1609
01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:26.570
Sorry, I didn't hear
what you said...

1610
01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:27.939
(British accent): Because
I can't understand you...

1611
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:29.705
'cause you talk like this.

1612
01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:32.076
Your mama's such
an old sloppy drunk...

1613
01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:34.547
I thought she was David Hasselhoff.

1614
01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:36.641
- (laughter)
- Yeah!

1615
01:17:38.453 --> 01:17:39.886
From <i>Knight Rider.</i>

1616
01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:41.081
Dinaladas, do-

1617
01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:42.646
Dot- Dingalidas, Dingalidas...

1618
01:17:42.724 --> 01:17:44.658
Dingledangle, do...

1619
01:17:44.726 --> 01:17:47.718
leg squats, and then
you will be a star...

1620
01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.388
you will be a star.

1621
01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:51.932
(whispering inaudibly)

1622
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.164
The last episode of <i>Sopranos</i>
was most disappointing.

1623
01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:59.264
I mean, did Tony get whacked
or live or what?

1624
01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:05.171
What happens in Vegas...

1625
01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:07.772
stays in Vegas.

1626
01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:12.183
You just-You keep doing
the thing you do...

1627
01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:15.587
'cause... the do is thing you do.

1628
01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:19.426
# Hey, DJ, turn me out #

1629
01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:21.894
#You gotta keep me movin'
till the moon goes down #

1630
01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:24.659
# If you want to show me,
get below me #

1631
01:18:24.733 --> 01:18:27.133
# Shake your thing
till you don't feel lonely #

1632
01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:29.102
# Hey, mister, break it down #

1633
01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:31.571
#You're a B-Boy
that nearly hit the ground #

1634
01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.370
#You could play it real cool,
act the old school #

1635
01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:37.105
#Jump around until
your act is so cool #

1636
01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:48.555
# Clap your hands
if you're feelin' me #

1637
01:18:48.623 --> 01:18:51.421
# One to the two,
two to the three #

1638
01:18:51.493 --> 01:18:53.688
# Clap your hands
if you're in the mix #

1639
01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:56.560
# Four to the five,
five to the six #

1640
01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:09.166
##

1641
01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:12.677
# Hey, DJ, turn me out #

1642
01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:15.216
#You gotta keep me movin'
till the moon goes down #

1643
01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:17.911
# If you want to show me,
get below me #

1644
01:19:17.986 --> 01:19:20.420
# Shake your thing
till you don't feel lonely #

1645
01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:22.423
# Hey, mister, break it down #

1646
01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:24.925
#You're a B-Boy
that nearly hit the ground #

1647
01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:27.689
#You could play it real cool,
act the old school #

1648
01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:30.493
#Jump around until
your act is so cool. #

1649
01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:40.871
(song ends)

1650
01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:44.878
(chorus sings noble,
triumphant theme)

1651
01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:48.939
(orchestration joins in,
accompanying chorus)

1652
01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.953
##

1653
01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:16.967
(orchestra playing suite
of dramatic themes)

1658

1659

1662

##

1663
01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:37.074
##

1664
01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:51.088

##

1679
01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.061
(rifle cocking,
blade scraping)

1680
01:26:11.132 --> 01:26:13.362
(low voice): When you're pushed,
killing's as easy as...

1681
01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:15.425
(higher pitch): Dancin'.

1682
01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:21.669
(dance music plays)
