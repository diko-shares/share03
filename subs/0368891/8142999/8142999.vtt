1
00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:30.257
Grandpa!

2
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.177
You're not supposed to be up here,
looking at that.

3
00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.513
I just wanted to know.

4
00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:40.559
You're old enough, I suppose.

5
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.645
You should know the story.

6
00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.482
Okay, here we go.

7
00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:52.029
It was 1832.

8
00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:56.199
On a night much like this.

9
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.127
<i>Charles Carroll
was the last surviving signer</i>

10
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.297
<i>of the Declaration of Independence.</i>

11
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.509
<i>He was also a member of
a secret society known as the Masons.</i>

12
00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:17.888
<i>And he knew he was dying.</i>

13
00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.891
<i>He woke up his stable boy
in the middle of the night</i>

14
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.143
<i>and ordered him to take him
to the White House</i>

15
00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:25.562
<i>to see Andrew Jackson,</i>

16
00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.066
<i>because it was urgent
that he speak to the president.</i>

17
00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:34.279
- Did he talk to him?
- No. He never got the chance.

18
00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:37.407
<i>The president wasn't there that night.</i>

19
00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:41.328
But Charles Carroll had a secret.

20
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:46.249
So he took into his confidence
the one person he could,

21
00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.211
my grandfather's grandfather,

22
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.713
Thomas Gates.

23
00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:53.590
What was the secret?

24
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.512
A treasure.

25
00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:02.974
A treasure beyond all imagining.

26
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.315
<i>A treasure that had been
fought over for centuries</i>

27
00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:14.736
<i>by tyrants, pharaohs,
emperors, warlords.</i>

28
00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.907
<i>And every time it changed hands
it grew larger.</i>

29
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.704
And then suddenly…

30
00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:25.997
It vanished.

31
00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:31.545
<i>It didn't reappear
for more than a thousand years,</i>

32
00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.255
<i>when knights from the First Crusade</i>

33
00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:37.050
<i>discovered secret vaults
beneath the Temple of Solomon.</i>

34
00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:39.720
<i>You see,
the knights who found the vaults</i>

35
00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:44.141
<i>believed that the treasure
was too great for any one man,</i>

36
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.268
<i>not even a king.</i>

37
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:50.063
<i>They brought the treasure back
to Europe and took the name</i>

38
00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:52.274
<i>"the Knights Templar."</i>

39
00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.988
<i>Over the next century
they smuggled it out of Europe</i>

40
00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:01.158
<i>and they formed a new brotherhood
called the Freemasons,</i>

41
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.161
<i>in honour of the builders
of the great temple.</i>

42
00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:06.872
<i>War followed.</i>

43
00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:09.166
<i>By the time
of the American Revolution</i>

44
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.001
<i>the treasure had been hidden again.</i>

45
00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.044
<i>By then the Masons included</i>

46
00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:16.590
<i>George Washington,
Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere.</i>

47
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.177
<i>They knew they had to make sure</i>

48
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.889
<i>the treasure would never fall
Into the hands of the British.</i>

49
00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:28.018
So they devised a series of clues
and maps to its location.

50
00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.979
Over time the clues were
lost or forgotten,

51
00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:34.941
<i>until only one remained,
and that was the secret</i>

52
00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:39.196
<i>that Charles Carroll entrusted
to young Thomas Gates.</i>

53
00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:46.661
Charlotte.

54
00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:50.540
"The secret lies with Charlotte."

55
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.876
Who's Charlotte?

56
00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.130
Not even Mr Carroll knew that.

57
00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:58.799
Now look here, Ben.

58
00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:03.303
The Freemasons among our
Founding Fathers left us clues.

59
00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:04.721
Like these.

60
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:08.558
The unfinished pyramid.
The all-seeing eye.

61
00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:12.812
Symbols of the Knights Templar,
guardians of the treasure.

62
00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:18.693
- They're speaking to us through these.
- You mean laughing at us.

63
00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:21.738
You know what that dollar represents?

64
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:24.157
The entire Gates family fortune.

65
00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:28.703
Six generations of fools.
Chasing after fool's gold.

66
00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.830
It's not about the money, Patrick.

67
00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.374
It's never been about the money.

68
00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:34.584
Come on, son. Time to go.

69
00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:37.671
You can say your goodbyes.

70
00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:46.972
Grandpa?

71
00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:51.810
Are we knights?

72
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.690
Do you want to be?

73
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.694
All right. Kneel.

74
00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.541
Benjamin Franklin Gates,

75
00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:20.088
you take upon yourself the duty
of the Templars, the Freemasons

76
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.424
and the family Gates.

77
00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.594
Do you so swear?

78
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:27.637
I so swear.

79
00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:54.789
I was thinking about Henson
and Peary, crossing this kind of terrain

80
00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:57.876
with nothing more
than dog sleds and on foot.

81
00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.837
- Can you imagine?
- It's extraordinary.

82
00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.470
We getting closer?

83
00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:12.599
Assuming Ben's theory's correct
and my tracking model's accurate,

84
00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.310
we should be getting very close.

85
00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:19.147
But don't go by me,
I broke a shoelace this morning.

86
00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:26.112
- It's… It's a bad omen.
- Shall we turn around and go home?

87
00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:29.449
Or we could pull over
and just throw him out here.

88
00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:32.118
Okay.

89
00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.704
Riley, you're not missing
that little windowless cubicle

90
00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:38.583
- we found you in, are you?
- No, no. Absolutely not.

91
00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:59.396
Why are we stopping?
I thought we were looking for a ship.

92
00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:02.857
- I don't see any ship.
- She's out there.

93
00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:17.205
Look… This is a waste of time.

94
00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:20.166
How could a ship wind up
way out here?

95
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.086
Well, I'm no expert, but…

96
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.090
It could be that the hydrothermic
properties of this region

97
00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.175
produce hurricane-force ice storms

98
00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:33.430
that cause the ocean to freeze
and then melt and then refreeze,

99
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:38.101
resulting in a semisolid
migrating land mass

100
00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:41.938
that would land a ship right
around here.

101
00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:32.614
Hello, beautiful.

102
00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:43.291
Have Viktor check the fuel
in the generators.

103
00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:49.756
Two years ago, if you hadn't shown up,
hadn't believed the treasure was real,

104
00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.092
I don't know if I ever
would have found <i>Charlotte.</i>

105
00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.928
You would have found it,
I have no doubt.

106
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:59.724
That's why I didn't think it was as crazy
an investment as everyone said.

107
00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:02.477
I'm just relieved that
I'm not as crazy as everyone says.

108
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.312
Or said my dad was.

109
00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:07.315
Or my granddad,
or my great-granddad.

110
00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:12.362
Okay! Let's go!

111
00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:17.283
- Let's go find some treasure.
- Yeah, bring us back something.

112
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.907
Oh, God!

113
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.746
You handled that well.

114
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:06.082
This is it.

115
00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:09.210
It's the cargo hold.

116
00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.267
Do you think it's in the barrels?

117
00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.871
Gunpowder.

118
00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:49.542
Okay.

119
00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:57.550
Why would the captain
be guarding this barrel?

120
00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.494
I found something!

121
00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:32.794
What is it?

122
00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.189
Do you guys know what this is?

123
00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:56.025
Is it a billion dollar pipe?

124
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.197
It's a meerschaum pipe.
That is beautiful.

125
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.409
Look at the intricacy
of the scrollwork on the stem.

126
00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:09.080
- Is it a million dollar pipe?
- No, it's a clue.

127
00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:10.748
Let me see that.

128
00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:15.044
No, what, don't break it!

129
00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.630
We are one step closer
to the treasure, gentlemen.

130
00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:20.359
Ben, I thought you said that
the treasure would be on the <i>Charlotte.</i>

131
00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:24.721
No, "The secret lies with Charlotte."
I said it could be here.

132
00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:44.157
It's Templar symbols.

133
00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.249
"The legend writ."

134
00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:55.293
"The stain effected."

135
00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:58.546
"The key in Silence undetected."

136
00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:03.092
"Fifty-five in iron pen."

137
00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.553
"Mr Matlack can't offend."

138
00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:10.683
It's a riddle.

139
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.105
I need to think.

140
00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.402
"The legend writ."

141
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.821
"The stain effected."

142
00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:26.783
What legend?

143
00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:29.994
There's the legend
of the Templar treasure,

144
00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:32.038
and the stain effects the legend.

145
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:33.206
How?

146
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.626
"The key in Silence undetected."

147
00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:38.836
Wait.

148
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.592
The legend and the key…
Now there's something.

149
00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:46.219
A map.

150
00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:49.013
Maps have legends, maps have keys.

151
00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:51.349
It's a map, an invisible map. So now…

152
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:54.727
Wait a minute. What do you mean,
"invisible," "an invisible map"?

153
00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:59.565
"The stain effected"
could refer to a dye or a reagent

154
00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:02.068
used to bring about a certain result.

155
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:05.071
Combined with
"The key in Silence undetected,"

156
00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:07.031
the implication is that the effect

157
00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:10.243
is to make what was
undetectable detectable.

158
00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:14.956
Unless…
"The key in Silence" could be…

159
00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:16.249
Prison.

160
00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.002
Albuquerque.

161
00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:23.047
See, I can do it, too. Snorkel.

162
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.567
That's where the map is.
Like he said, "Fifty-five in iron pen."

163
00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:27.135
"Iron pen" is a prison.

164
00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:32.014
Or it could be, since the primary writing
medium of the time was iron gall ink,

165
00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:35.852
the "pen" is… Just a pen.

166
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:40.064
But then why not say a pen?
Why… Why say "iron pen"?

167
00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.359
'Cause it's a prison.

168
00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:44.569
Wait a minute. "Iron pen,"

169
00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:48.197
the "iron" does not describe
the ink in the pen,

170
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:51.075
it describes what was penned.

171
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:54.370
It was "iron,"
it was firm, it was mineral…

172
00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:56.122
No, no, no, that's stupid.

173
00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:57.915
It was…

174
00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:01.878
It was firm, it was adamant,
it was resolved.

175
00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:05.131
It was resolved.

176
00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:08.384
"Mr Matlack can't offend."

177
00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:12.346
Timothy Matlack was the official scribe
of the Continental Congress.

178
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.473
Calligrapher, not writer.

179
00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.309
And to make sure
he could not offend the map,

180
00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:20.354
it was put on the back of a resolution
that he transcribed,

181
00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:24.609
a resolution that 55 men signed.

182
00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:29.238
The Declaration of Independence.

183
00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:38.247
Come on, there's no invisible map

184
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:41.000
on the back
of the Declaration of Independence.

185
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.210
That's clever, really.

186
00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:45.671
A document of that importance
would ensure the map's survival.

187
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:48.674
And you said there were several
Masons signed it, yeah?

188
00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:52.011
Yeah. Nine, for sure.

189
00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:56.182
We'll have to arrange
a way to examine it.

190
00:16:56.933 --> 00:17:00.186
This is one of the most important
documents in history.

191
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:04.649
They're not just gonna let us waltz
in there and run chemical tests on it.

192
00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:07.902
- Then what do you propose we do?
- I don't know!

193
00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.657
We could borrow it.

194
00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:15.451
Steal it?

195
00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:19.997
- I don't think so.
- Ben…

196
00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:24.126
The treasure of the Knights Templar
is the treasure of all treasures.

197
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.462
I didn't know that. Really?

198
00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:29.507
Look, Ben…

199
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.301
I understand your bitterness.
I really do.

200
00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.530
You've spent your entire life
searching for this treasure,

201
00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.681
only to have the respected
historical community

202
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:40.059
treat you and your family
with mockery and contempt.

203
00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:43.521
You should be able to rub this treasure
in their arrogant faces,

204
00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:46.065
and I want you to have
the chance to do that.

205
00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.192
How?

206
00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:51.779
We all have our areas of expertise.

207
00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:56.367
You don't think mine are limited
to writing cheques, do you?

208
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.119
In another life,

209
00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:03.332
I arranged a number of operations of

210
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.960
questionable legality.

211
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.339
I'd take his word for it, if I were you.

212
00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:16.178
So don't worry.
I'll make all the arrangements.

213
00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.098
No.

214
00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:27.440
I'd really need your help here.

215
00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:33.070
Ian, I'm not gonna let you steal
the Declaration of Independence.

216
00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:34.447
Okay.

217
00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:39.201
From this point on,
all you're going to be is a hindrance.

218
00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:42.455
Hey!

219
00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:46.000
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me, Shaw?

220
00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:50.171
Well, you can't shoot me.
There's more to the riddle.

221
00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:53.174
Information you don't have. I do.

222
00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:56.093
I'm the only one who can figure it out,
and you know that.

223
00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:57.678
He's bluffing.

224
00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:01.557
We played poker together, Ian.
You know I can't bluff.

225
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:06.145
Tell me what I need to know, Ben,
or I'll shoot your friend.

226
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.233
Quiet, Riley! Your job's finished here.

227
00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:19.075
Look where you're standing.
All that gunpowder.

228
00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:23.245
You shoot me, I drop this, we all go up.

229
00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:25.915
Ben…

230
00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:30.002
What happens
when the flare burns down?

231
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:34.507
Tell me what I need to know, Ben.

232
00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:37.593
You need to know

233
00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:39.470
if Shaw can catch.

234
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.478
Nice try, though.

235
00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:00.658
Get out, Shaw!

236
00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:11.085
Fool!

237
00:20:15.798 --> 00:20:17.591
Riley, get over here!

238
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.975
- What is this?
- Smuggler's hold. Get in!

239
00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:32.440
Move! Get out of here!

240
00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:34.650
- What?
- Move! Get out!

241
00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:36.527
Follow me.

242
00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:43.451
Let's go, let's go! She's gonna blow!

243
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.333
Get down.

244
00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:26.368
Okay, let's go.
Before someone sees the smoke.

245
00:21:57.399 --> 00:22:00.402
There's an Inuit village
about nine miles east of here.

246
00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:04.156
- It's popular with bush pilots.
- All right.

247
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.915
- Then what are we gonna do?
- Start making our way back home.

248
00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:17.670
No, I meant about Ian. He's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence, Ben.

249
00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:20.130
We stop him.

250
00:22:38.566 --> 00:22:39.817
Is it really so hard to believe

251
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.379
that someone's gonna try to steal
the Declaration of Independence?

252
00:22:42.403 --> 00:22:44.697
The FBI gets 10,000 tips a week.

253
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.180
They're not gonna worry about
something they're sure is safe.

254
00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:49.910
But anyone that can do anything
is gonna think we're crazy.

255
00:22:49.994 --> 00:22:53.205
Anyone crazy enough to believe us
isn't gonna want to help.

256
00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:54.665
We don't need someone crazy.

257
00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:57.793
But one step short of crazy,
what do you get?

258
00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.461
Obsessed.

259
00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:01.130
Passionate.

260
00:23:09.263 --> 00:23:10.598
Excuse me.

261
00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:18.564
Dr Chase can see you now,
Mr Brown.

262
00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:20.274
- Thank you.
- Mr Brown?

263
00:23:20.357 --> 00:23:23.652
The family name doesn't get a lot
of respect in the academic community.

264
00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:26.322
Being kept down by the man.

265
00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:30.409
A very cute man.

266
00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:31.827
Thank you.

267
00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:35.372
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Hi.

268
00:23:35.456 --> 00:23:37.625
- Abigail Chase.
- Paul Brown.

269
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:40.461
- Nice to meet you.
- Bill.

270
00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:42.630
Nice to meet you, Bill.

271
00:23:42.713 --> 00:23:45.966
- How may I help you?
- Your accent. Pennsylvania Dutch?

272
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.510
Saxony German.

273
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:51.889
- You're not American?
- I am an American.

274
00:23:51.972 --> 00:23:55.100
I just wasn't born here.
Please don't touch that!

275
00:23:55.184 --> 00:23:56.685
Sorry. A neat collection.

276
00:23:56.769 --> 00:23:58.687
George Washington's
campaign buttons.

277
00:23:58.771 --> 00:24:01.440
You're missing
the 1789 inaugural, though.

278
00:24:01.523 --> 00:24:04.485
- I found one once.
- That's very fortunate for you.

279
00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:07.571
Now, you told my assistant
that this was an urgent matter.

280
00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:09.198
Yes, ma'am.

281
00:24:09.907 --> 00:24:12.493
I'm gonna get straight to the point.

282
00:24:14.203 --> 00:24:17.539
Someone's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

283
00:24:20.084 --> 00:24:21.460
It's true.

284
00:24:23.837 --> 00:24:26.024
I think I'd better put you gentlemen
in touch with the FBI.

285
00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:27.967
- We've been to the FBI.
- And?

286
00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.637
They assured us that the Declaration
cannot possibly be stolen.

287
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.889
- They're right.
- My friend and I are less certain.

288
00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:38.143
However, if we were given the privilege
of examining the document…

289
00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:42.940
We would be able to tell you for certain
if it were actually in any danger.

290
00:24:43.023 --> 00:24:45.025
What do you think you're gonna find?

291
00:24:45.109 --> 00:24:50.990
We believe that there's
an encryption on the back.

292
00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:55.077
- An encryption, like a code?
- Yes, ma'am.

293
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.581
- Of what?
- A cartograph.

294
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.251
- A map.
- Yes, ma'am.

295
00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:04.420
A map of what?

296
00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:10.634
The location of… Of hidden items

297
00:25:10.718 --> 00:25:16.098
of historic and intrinsic value.

298
00:25:17.975 --> 00:25:21.645
- A treasure map?
- That's where we lost the FBI.

299
00:25:21.729 --> 00:25:24.565
You're treasure-hunters, aren't you?

300
00:25:24.648 --> 00:25:27.443
We're more like treasure protectors.

301
00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:30.362
Mr Brown,
I have personally seen the back

302
00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:32.197
of the Declaration of Independence,

303
00:25:32.281 --> 00:25:36.243
and I promise you, the only thing there
is a notation that reads,

304
00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:38.620
"Original Declaration
of Independence, dated…"

305
00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:41.457
"Four of July, 1776." Yes, ma'am.

306
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.916
But no map.

307
00:25:56.638 --> 00:26:00.893
- It's invisible.
- Oh, right.

308
00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:04.688
And that's where we lost
the Department of Homeland Security.

309
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.859
What led you to assume
there's this invisible map?

310
00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:12.071
We found an engraving
on the stem of a 200-year-old pipe.

311
00:26:12.154 --> 00:26:14.323
Owned by Freemasons.

312
00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:18.327
- May I see the pipe?
- We don't have it.

313
00:26:20.788 --> 00:26:23.999
- Did Bigfoot take it?
- It was nice meeting you.

314
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:26.835
Nice to meet you, too.

315
00:26:27.503 --> 00:26:30.089
And, you know,
that really is a nice collection.

316
00:26:30.172 --> 00:26:34.051
Must have taken you a long time
to hunt down all that history.

317
00:26:37.513 --> 00:26:40.516
If it's any consolation,
you had me convinced.

318
00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:42.184
It's not.

319
00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:47.105
I was thinking, what if we go public,
plaster the story all over the Internet?

320
00:26:47.189 --> 00:26:51.443
It's not like
we have our reputations to worry about.

321
00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:55.531
Although I don't think
that's exactly gonna scare Ian away.

322
00:26:56.824 --> 00:26:59.910
180 years of searching,
and I'm three feet away.

323
00:27:00.702 --> 00:27:03.288
Of all the words written here
about freedom,

324
00:27:03.372 --> 00:27:06.458
there's a line
that's at the heart of all the others.

325
00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:10.295
"But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations,

326
00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:12.965
"pursuing invariably the same Object,

327
00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:16.969
"evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute Despotism,

328
00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:20.973
"it is their right, it is their duty
to throw off such government

329
00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:24.685
"and provide new Guards
for their future security."

330
00:27:26.395 --> 00:27:28.814
People don't talk that way anymore.

331
00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:30.440
Beautiful.

332
00:27:32.276 --> 00:27:35.320
- No idea what you said.
- It means, if there's something wrong,

333
00:27:35.404 --> 00:27:37.114
those who have the ability
to take action

334
00:27:37.197 --> 00:27:39.908
have the responsibility to take action.

335
00:27:44.872 --> 00:27:46.582
I'm gonna steal it.

336
00:27:50.127 --> 00:27:51.753
What?

337
00:27:51.962 --> 00:27:54.673
I'm gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

338
00:28:00.429 --> 00:28:01.805
Ben?

339
00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:05.434
This is huge.

340
00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:08.854
It's prison huge.

341
00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:11.023
You are gonna go to prison,
you know that?

342
00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:12.608
Yeah, probably.

343
00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:16.236
So that would bother most people.

344
00:28:16.778 --> 00:28:18.405
Ian's gonna try and steal it.

345
00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:21.575
And if he succeeds,
he'll destroy the Declaration.

346
00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:25.203
The fact is, the only way to protect
the Declaration is to steal it.

347
00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:26.955
It's upside down.

348
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:31.376
I don't think there's a choice.

349
00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:34.671
Ben, for God's sakes,

350
00:28:34.755 --> 00:28:38.717
it's like stealing a national monument.
Okay?

351
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.302
It's like stealing him.

352
00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:45.432
It can't be done. Not shouldn't be done.
It can't be done.

353
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.977
Let me prove it to you.

354
00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:51.980
Okay, Ben, pay attention.

355
00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:54.900
I've brought you to the
Library of Congress.

356
00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:58.654
Why? Because it's the biggest library
in the world.

357
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.822
Over 20 million books.

358
00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:03.617
And they're all saying
the same exact thing.

359
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.869
Listen to Riley.

360
00:29:05.953 --> 00:29:11.041
What we have here, my friend,
is an entire layout of the archives.

361
00:29:11.124 --> 00:29:13.293
Short of builders' blueprints.

362
00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:18.090
You've got construction orders,
phone lines,

363
00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:21.343
water and sewage, it's all here.

364
00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:24.471
Now, when the Declaration
is on display, okay,

365
00:29:24.554 --> 00:29:27.933
it is surrounded by guards
and video monitors

366
00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:29.768
<i>and little families from Iowa</i>

367
00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:32.020
<i>and little kids
on their eighth-grade field trip.</i>

368
00:29:32.104 --> 00:29:34.356
<i>And beneath an inch
of bulletproof glass</i>

369
00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:36.858
<i>is an army of sensors
and heat monitors</i>

370
00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:40.988
<i>that will go off if someone
gets too close with a high fever.</i>

371
00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:44.408
Now, when it's not on display,

372
00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:51.415
<i>it is lowered into a four-foot-thick
concrete, steel-plated vault…</i>

373
00:29:52.582 --> 00:29:56.920
That happens to be equipped
with an electronic combination lock

374
00:29:57.004 --> 00:29:59.256
and biometric access-denial systems.

375
00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:03.093
You know, Thomas Edison tried
and failed nearly 2,000 times

376
00:30:03.176 --> 00:30:05.595
to develop the carbonised
cotton-thread filament

377
00:30:05.679 --> 00:30:08.307
- for the incandescent light bulb.
- Edison?

378
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:09.641
When asked about it, he said,

379
00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:13.437
"I didn't fail, I found out 2,000 ways
how not to make a light bulb."

380
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.732
But he only needed to find one way
to make it work.

381
00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:22.612
The Preservation Room.
Enjoy. Go ahead.

382
00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:26.825
Do you know
what the Preservation Room is for?

383
00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:28.994
Delicious jams and jellies?

384
00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:32.331
No. That's where they clean,
repair and maintain

385
00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:34.332
all the documents
and the storage housings

386
00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:36.501
when they're not on display
or in the vault.

387
00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:39.463
Now, when the case needs work
they take it out of the vault,

388
00:30:39.546 --> 00:30:42.674
<i>directly across the hall
and into the Preservation Room.</i>

389
00:30:42.758 --> 00:30:46.887
<i>The best time for us, or Ian, to steal it
would be during the gala this weekend</i>

390
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.890
<i>when the guards are distracted
by the VIPs upstairs.</i>

391
00:30:49.973 --> 00:30:52.601
<i>But we'll make our way
to the Preservation Room,</i>

392
00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:55.729
where there's much less security.

393
00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:01.318
Well, if Ian…

394
00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:05.989
Preservation…

395
00:31:06.073 --> 00:31:07.949
The gala.

396
00:31:10.327 --> 00:31:12.245
This might be possible.

397
00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:14.790
It might.

398
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.243
And we are in.

399
00:32:03.213 --> 00:32:06.007
There you are. Hello.

400
00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:11.972
The hallway.

401
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.313
That's what I want.

402
00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:34.870
Game on.

403
00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:12.157
I'll buy that.

404
00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:17.871
Cool.

405
00:33:49.945 --> 00:33:51.947
This just came for you.

406
00:33:53.114 --> 00:33:55.283
I hope it's not from Stan.

407
00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:59.537
"For the woman who has
everything else…"

408
00:33:59.621 --> 00:34:01.915
"Thanks for listening. Paul Brown."

409
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:48.420
Abigail Chase.

410
00:35:04.519 --> 00:35:05.854
Hey, Mike.

411
00:35:10.483 --> 00:35:12.944
{\an8}<i>- Let's do this by the book.
- Hallway is secure.</i>

412
00:35:13.028 --> 00:35:15.071
{\an8}<i>- Keep the document level.
- No problem.</i>

413
00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:17.032
<i>What have you got?</i>

414
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:18.968
<i>The heat sensor went off
in the Declaration frame.</i>

415
00:35:18.992 --> 00:35:22.454
<i>Run full diagnostics,
then I want them all changed out.</i>

416
00:35:22.537 --> 00:35:24.539
Our evil plan is working.

417
00:36:04.871 --> 00:36:08.291
Ben, are you sure that we should…

418
00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:11.920
<i>Riley.</i>

419
00:36:12.379 --> 00:36:15.215
- Can you hear me?
<i>- Unfortunately, yeah.</i>

420
00:36:15.298 --> 00:36:16.466
<i>We're all set in here.</i>

421
00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:20.261
You want to go around to the front
and present your invitation.

422
00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:23.515
You're gonna have to show ID.
Go ahead, man.

423
00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.936
- How's it going?
- Howdy.

424
00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:36.861
I need your invitation
and your ID, please.

425
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.715
<i>How do you look?</i>

426
00:36:57.799 --> 00:37:00.468
- Not bad.
<i>- Mazel tov.</i>

427
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:09.728
This is it.

428
00:37:43.011 --> 00:37:44.220
For you.

429
00:37:45.805 --> 00:37:48.099
- Mr Brown.
- Dr Chase.

430
00:37:48.183 --> 00:37:51.686
<i>- What are you doing here?</i>
- Is that that hot girl?

431
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:52.896
<i>How does she look?</i>

432
00:37:52.979 --> 00:37:56.691
I made a last-minute donation.
Pretty big one.

433
00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:59.486
Well, on that subject,
thank you for your wonderful gift.

434
00:37:59.569 --> 00:38:02.489
- Oh, you did get it? Good.
- Yes, thank you.

435
00:38:02.572 --> 00:38:06.701
You know, I really couldn't accept
something like that normally, but…

436
00:38:06.785 --> 00:38:08.411
I really want it.

437
00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:11.956
- Well, you needed it.
<i>- Come on, Romeo, get out of there.</i>

438
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.627
I have been wondering, though,
what the engraving indicated

439
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.713
- on the pipe that Bigfoot took.
- Hi.

440
00:38:19.881 --> 00:38:23.718
- Here you go.
- Dr Herbert, this is Mr Brown.

441
00:38:24.219 --> 00:38:25.512
- Hi.
- Hi there.

442
00:38:25.595 --> 00:38:29.140
<i>- Who's the stiff?</i>
- Here, why don't you let me take that?

443
00:38:29.224 --> 00:38:32.977
- So you can take that off his hands.
- Thank you.

444
00:38:33.937 --> 00:38:35.980
A toast, yeah?

445
00:38:36.064 --> 00:38:37.649
To high treason.

446
00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:41.694
That's what these men were committing
when they signed the Declaration.

447
00:38:41.778 --> 00:38:44.322
Had we lost the war,
they would have been hanged,

448
00:38:44.405 --> 00:38:49.202
beheaded, drawn and quartered,
and, oh, my personal favourite,

449
00:38:49.285 --> 00:38:51.955
had their entrails cut out and burnt!

450
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:58.294
So, here's to the men
who did what was considered wrong

451
00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:01.589
in order to do
what they knew was right.

452
00:39:03.258 --> 00:39:05.260
What they knew was right.

453
00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:18.481
Well, good night.

454
00:39:18.565 --> 00:39:20.608
- Good night.
- Good night.

455
00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:38.626
Yeah!

456
00:39:41.087 --> 00:39:42.630
Okay, go! Go!

457
00:39:55.101 --> 00:39:56.853
This better work.

458
00:40:02.817 --> 00:40:03.943
Clear!

459
00:40:09.198 --> 00:40:12.285
- On.
- Door one. 30 seconds.

460
00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:23.004
How does it look?

461
00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:29.093
It's working. It's working.

462
00:40:29.177 --> 00:40:30.637
Unbelievable.

463
00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:53.493
Second door. 90 seconds.

464
00:41:06.214 --> 00:41:08.383
Well done, boys. Let's go.

465
00:41:21.854 --> 00:41:23.231
We're in the elevator.

466
00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:24.565
Okay.

467
00:41:24.649 --> 00:41:27.402
I'm gonna turn off
the surveillance cameras. Ready?

468
00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:32.573
In five, four, three… Now.

469
00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:37.078
{\an8}Ben Gates,
you are now the Invisible Man.

470
00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:45.084
- I'm here.
<i>- Give me the letters for her password.</i>

471
00:41:45.837 --> 00:41:46.921
What do you got for me?

472
00:41:50.717 --> 00:41:52.427
Hit me with it.

473
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:57.724
A-E-F-G-L-O-R-V-Y.

474
00:41:57.807 --> 00:41:59.767
<i>Anagrams being listed.</i>

475
00:42:01.269 --> 00:42:02.603
Okay.

476
00:42:03.438 --> 00:42:06.190
Top results, "A glove fry."

477
00:42:06.274 --> 00:42:08.025
"A very golf."

478
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:09.777
"Fargo levy."

479
00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:11.988
"Gravy floe. Valey frog."

480
00:42:12.071 --> 00:42:14.991
<i>Also "Ago fly rev."</i>

481
00:42:15.908 --> 00:42:17.410
"Grove fly a."

482
00:42:17.493 --> 00:42:19.328
"Are fly gov."

483
00:42:19.412 --> 00:42:21.622
"Era fly gov."

484
00:42:21.706 --> 00:42:24.542
<i>- "Elf gov ray."</i>
- It's "Valley Forge."

485
00:42:25.043 --> 00:42:27.712
"Valley Forge."
I don't have that on my computer.

486
00:42:27.795 --> 00:42:29.940
It's "Valley Forge,"
she pressed the "E" and "L" twice.

487
00:42:29.964 --> 00:42:32.592
Valley Forge was a turning point
in the American Revolution.

488
00:42:32.884 --> 00:42:34.260
Can I marry your brain?

489
00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:41.517
<i>We're in.</i>

490
00:42:45.605 --> 00:42:47.398
Hello.

491
00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:54.655
Ben, you're doing great.

492
00:43:03.664 --> 00:43:05.291
<i>Ben, pick it up.</i>

493
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.344
You got about one…

494
00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:22.892
We own video.

495
00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:25.937
- I lost my feed.
- What?

496
00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.772
I lost my feed, Ben.

497
00:43:27.855 --> 00:43:29.857
<i>I don't know where anyone is.
I have nothing.</i>

498
00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:31.984
Ben, I have no… Ben, I have nothing.

499
00:43:32.068 --> 00:43:34.445
Get out of there. Get out of there now.

500
00:43:34.529 --> 00:43:36.889
I'm taking the whole thing.
I'll get it out in the elevator.

501
00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:39.659
What are you talking… Is it heavy?

502
00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:48.209
Shaw. Door three, one minute.

503
00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:04.892
Gates.

504
00:44:09.647 --> 00:44:11.315
What was that?

505
00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:15.653
Who's shooting?

506
00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:20.158
- Damn.
- He's got the bloody map!

507
00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:22.952
Are you still there? Ben?

508
00:44:23.077 --> 00:44:24.829
I'm in the elevator.

509
00:44:25.413 --> 00:44:29.041
Ian's here. There was shooting.

510
00:44:29.125 --> 00:44:30.459
I hate that guy.

511
00:44:35.423 --> 00:44:39.385
Rebecca.
Do you have a Paul Brown on that list?

512
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.930
Paul Brown? No. Not here.

513
00:44:56.694 --> 00:44:58.613
Have a good night.

514
00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.830
Are you trying to steal that?

515
00:45:13.628 --> 00:45:15.296
It's $35.

516
00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:19.175
- For this?
- Yeah.

517
00:45:19.258 --> 00:45:22.637
- That's a lot.
- I don't make the prices.

518
00:45:25.473 --> 00:45:26.849
It's…

519
00:45:28.935 --> 00:45:31.771
I have $32…

520
00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:37.443
57.

521
00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:39.779
We take Visa.

522
00:45:50.081 --> 00:45:52.625
This is Mike. Sublevel three.
I have an alert.

523
00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:55.461
Where are you, Ben?

524
00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:23.155
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Stop talking.

525
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:25.533
Start the van.

526
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:37.920
Ben, the mean Declaration lady's
behind you.

527
00:46:44.093 --> 00:46:46.554
It's you. Hello.

528
00:46:47.013 --> 00:46:50.182
Mr Brown, what's going on?
What's that?

529
00:46:50.266 --> 00:46:52.935
- It's a souvenir.
- Really?

530
00:46:53.019 --> 00:46:55.563
Stop chatting and get in the van.

531
00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:02.695
Code red. Code red.
We have a break-in.

532
00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:04.613
Lock it down.
Nobody leaves the building.

533
00:47:04.697 --> 00:47:06.824
Get the FBI on the phone.

534
00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:13.581
- Did you enjoy the party?
- Yeah.

535
00:47:17.585 --> 00:47:21.172
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! You did not…

536
00:47:21.255 --> 00:47:23.507
- No…
- Security! Over here!

537
00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:25.801
- Give me that!
- It's yours. Take it.

538
00:47:25.885 --> 00:47:27.970
Security!

539
00:47:28.054 --> 00:47:31.724
- Over here! Security!
- Got you.

540
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.851
Go.

541
00:47:33.934 --> 00:47:35.686
Viktor! Move!

542
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.522
- We can't just let her go!
- We can. Go!

543
00:47:38.939 --> 00:47:42.026
- Security, over here!
- Wait. No, hold it.

544
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:43.319
Hold it!

545
00:47:45.946 --> 00:47:46.947
- What…
- Oh, bad.

546
00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:48.425
- What do you want? Get away.
- Give me the document.

547
00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:50.117
Bad, bad, bad!

548
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.165
- Let me go!
- Just bring her!

549
00:47:56.248 --> 00:47:57.666
No! No!

550
00:48:04.507 --> 00:48:07.093
- That's…
- Go! Go!

551
00:48:16.477 --> 00:48:18.395
And just who might you be?

552
00:48:21.857 --> 00:48:25.444
- Once we catch them what do we do?
- I'm working on it.

553
00:48:27.113 --> 00:48:29.156
Right turn, right turn.

554
00:48:29.949 --> 00:48:31.784
Why don't you just pass me
that document?

555
00:48:31.867 --> 00:48:33.661
Then we can all go home.

556
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:47.091
Oh, no.

557
00:49:02.148 --> 00:49:03.858
Skidding, skidding, skidding.

558
00:49:10.239 --> 00:49:12.700
- Oh, no!
- Holy Lord!

559
00:49:17.037 --> 00:49:18.873
- Help!
- No!

560
00:49:18.956 --> 00:49:21.041
If she falls, the document falls.

561
00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:24.044
Get me next to her.

562
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:47.026
- Thank you.
- No!

563
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:48.652
Got it. Go on.

564
00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:52.072
Abigail!

565
00:49:54.033 --> 00:49:56.452
Come on. Jump.

566
00:50:05.461 --> 00:50:07.463
- We lost them.
- That's all right.

567
00:50:07.546 --> 00:50:10.007
This is what we need.

568
00:50:19.975 --> 00:50:22.478
Well done, Gates. Well done.

569
00:50:25.231 --> 00:50:27.775
- Are you all right?
- No! Those lunatics…

570
00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:30.653
- You're not hurt, are you?
- You are all lunatics!

571
00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:32.154
- Are you hungry?
- What?

572
00:50:32.238 --> 00:50:33.656
Are you all right?

573
00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:37.618
Still a little on edge from being shot at,
but I'll be okay. Thanks for asking.

574
00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:38.901
Yeah, well, I'm not all right.

575
00:50:38.953 --> 00:50:41.413
Those men have
the Declaration of Independence!

576
00:50:41.497 --> 00:50:45.167
- She lost it?
- They don't have it.

577
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.214
See? Okay?
Now could you please stop shouting?

578
00:50:51.131 --> 00:50:53.551
- Give me that!
- You're still shouting.

579
00:50:53.634 --> 00:50:54.994
And it's really starting to annoy.

580
00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:58.973
You'd do well, Dr Chase, to be
a bit more civilised in this instance.

581
00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:01.892
If this is the real one,
what did they get?

582
00:51:01.976 --> 00:51:03.769
A souvenir.

583
00:51:03.852 --> 00:51:06.313
I thought it'd be a good idea
to have a duplicate.

584
00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:07.898
It turned out I was right.

585
00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:10.859
I actually had to pay for the souvenir
and the real one,

586
00:51:10.943 --> 00:51:14.738
so you owe me $35, plus tax.

587
00:51:14.822 --> 00:51:17.741
- Genius.
- Who were those men?

588
00:51:17.825 --> 00:51:20.452
Just the guys we warned you
were gonna steal the Declaration.

589
00:51:20.536 --> 00:51:22.288
And you didn't believe us.

590
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:25.833
We did the only thing we could do
to keep it safe.

591
00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:27.626
<i>Verdammt!</i> Give me that!

592
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:30.087
You know something?
You're shouting again.

593
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:31.922
I'm pretty sure she was swearing, too.

594
00:51:32.006 --> 00:51:34.300
Well, we probably deserve that.

595
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.934
Ladies and gentlemen…

596
00:51:44.018 --> 00:51:48.522
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is
Peter Sadusky. I'm the agent in charge.

597
00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:51.608
I wanna reassure you,
you are not in danger in any way.

598
00:51:51.692 --> 00:51:53.152
If we all cooperate,

599
00:51:53.235 --> 00:51:56.655
we'll get through this
with as little frustration as possible.

600
00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:58.282
Thank you.

601
00:52:00.034 --> 00:52:04.163
Get positive IDs. Search everyone,
including the security staff.

602
00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:07.666
If they refuse,
detain them and get warrants.

603
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.753
Yes, Agent Hendricks?
You have something?

604
00:52:11.086 --> 00:52:13.714
- Um…
- This isn't a day for "Um…"

605
00:52:14.548 --> 00:52:16.175
We got a tip several days ago

606
00:52:16.258 --> 00:52:19.595
that someone was going to steal
the Declaration of Independence.

607
00:52:19.678 --> 00:52:21.764
Do we have a name on the tipster?

608
00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:26.685
There was no file opened.
We didn't find the information credible.

609
00:52:27.686 --> 00:52:29.229
How about now?

610
00:52:29.563 --> 00:52:31.523
There is not a treasure map

611
00:52:31.607 --> 00:52:33.447
on the back
of the Declaration of Independence.

612
00:52:33.525 --> 00:52:37.404
And there's no chance
anyone can steal this either.

613
00:52:38.739 --> 00:52:41.909
I levelled with you 100%.
Everything I told you was the truth.

614
00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:44.536
I want that document, Mr Brown.

615
00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.289
Okay, my name's not Brown. It's Gates.

616
00:52:47.373 --> 00:52:49.667
I levelled with you 98%.

617
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:52.461
Wait a minute,
did you just say "Gates"?

618
00:52:53.754 --> 00:52:55.172
Gates?

619
00:52:55.255 --> 00:52:58.842
You're that family with the conspiracy
theory about the Founding Fathers?

620
00:52:58.926 --> 00:53:02.262
- It's not a conspiracy theory.
- Per se.

621
00:53:02.346 --> 00:53:06.100
You know what? I take it back.
You're not liars. You're insane.

622
00:53:06.183 --> 00:53:08.435
There's a copy of the Declaration
on display now?

623
00:53:08.519 --> 00:53:10.687
- Yes, we decided to…
- Leave it there.

624
00:53:10.771 --> 00:53:13.565
The guests know something happened,
but they don't know what.

625
00:53:13.649 --> 00:53:15.609
They got him
with a Taser at the service entrance.

626
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:16.753
He doesn't remember a thing.

627
00:53:16.777 --> 00:53:18.821
Also, we found bullet casings.

628
00:53:18.904 --> 00:53:20.674
Did we get a description
from the other guards?

629
00:53:20.698 --> 00:53:23.701
- Which guards?
- The guards that were fired upon.

630
00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:27.121
There weren't any other guards
on patrol down here.

631
00:53:28.288 --> 00:53:29.415
So,

632
00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:33.627
who was shooting,
who were they shooting at,

633
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:36.130
and why weren't they getting along?

634
00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:39.091
You can't seriously intend
to run chemical tests

635
00:53:39.174 --> 00:53:42.136
on the Declaration of Independence
in the back of a moving van.

636
00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:43.939
We have a clean-room environment
all set up.

637
00:53:43.971 --> 00:53:46.056
EDS suits,
a particulate air filtration system,

638
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.349
the whole shebang.

639
00:53:47.433 --> 00:53:49.768
- Really?
- We can't go back there.

640
00:53:49.852 --> 00:53:51.812
What? Why not?

641
00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:52.980
This is the guy.

642
00:53:53.063 --> 00:53:55.774
Dr Herbert said Dr Chase
introduced him as Mr Brown.

643
00:53:55.858 --> 00:53:57.025
Not on the guest list.

644
00:53:57.109 --> 00:54:01.238
Now, the gift-store clerk, she said,
he seemed… Well, she said "flustered."

645
00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:04.241
He tried to walk out with a copy
of the Declaration of Independence

646
00:54:04.324 --> 00:54:05.909
without paying.

647
00:54:06.577 --> 00:54:08.537
He paid with a Visa.

648
00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.873
"Charge to Benjamin Gates."

649
00:54:12.124 --> 00:54:14.585
A credit-card slip?

650
00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:16.253
Dude, we're on the grid.

651
00:54:16.336 --> 00:54:17.921
They'll have your records from forever.

652
00:54:18.005 --> 00:54:20.066
- They'll have my records from forever.
- I know. I know.

653
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:22.861
It's only a matter of minutes before
the FBI shows up at my front door.

654
00:54:22.885 --> 00:54:24.386
What do we do?

655
00:54:25.012 --> 00:54:27.681
- We need those letters.
- What letters?

656
00:54:30.184 --> 00:54:32.102
You know, get off the road, take a right.

657
00:54:32.186 --> 00:54:34.104
What letters?

658
00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:38.275
You have the original
Silence Dogood letters?

659
00:54:38.358 --> 00:54:40.068
Did you steal those, too?

660
00:54:40.152 --> 00:54:42.196
We have scans of the originals.

661
00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:45.532
- Quiet, please.
- How'd you get scans?

662
00:54:45.616 --> 00:54:48.911
I know the person
who has the originals. Now shush.

663
00:54:51.872 --> 00:54:53.207
Why do you need them?

664
00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:56.210
She really can't shut her mouth,
can she?

665
00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:57.461
I'll tell you what, look.

666
00:54:57.544 --> 00:55:02.841
I will let you hold onto this
if you'll promise to shut up, please.

667
00:55:02.925 --> 00:55:04.259
Thank you.

668
00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:08.639
- Ben, you know what you have to do.
- I know what to do.

669
00:55:08.722 --> 00:55:11.433
I'm just trying to think
of anything else we could do.

670
00:55:11.517 --> 00:55:13.977
Well, not to be a noodge,

671
00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:17.397
but you do realise
how many people we have after us.

672
00:55:18.273 --> 00:55:21.068
We probably have
our own satellite by now.

673
00:55:22.736 --> 00:55:25.322
It took you all of two seconds

674
00:55:25.405 --> 00:55:28.283
to decide to steal
the Declaration of Independence.

675
00:55:28.367 --> 00:55:32.162
Yeah, but I didn't think I was gonna
personally have to tell my dad about it.

676
00:55:32.246 --> 00:55:36.583
- Hey, not cool! Not cool!
- Let me go!

677
00:55:37.251 --> 00:55:39.503
Okay. You're let go. Go.

678
00:55:39.586 --> 00:55:41.922
I'm not going.
Not without the Declaration.

679
00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:44.925
You're not going with the Declaration.

680
00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:48.679
Yes, I am. I'm not letting it
out of my sight, so I'm going.

681
00:55:48.762 --> 00:55:51.932
Wait. You're not going with us
with the Declaration.

682
00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:54.601
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

683
00:55:56.311 --> 00:55:58.522
Look,
if you wanted to leave me behind,

684
00:55:58.605 --> 00:56:01.859
you shouldn't have told me
where you were going.

685
00:56:17.708 --> 00:56:18.876
Clear.

686
00:56:20.335 --> 00:56:21.753
What the…

687
00:56:24.298 --> 00:56:26.967
Now we're getting somewhere.

688
00:56:27.843 --> 00:56:29.052
They're digital scans

689
00:56:29.136 --> 00:56:31.888
of letters to the editor
of <i>The New England Courant.</i>

690
00:56:31.972 --> 00:56:34.057
Written 1722.

691
00:56:34.641 --> 00:56:36.101
They're all from the same person.

692
00:56:36.184 --> 00:56:39.062
"Your humble servant,
Silence Dogood."

693
00:56:54.536 --> 00:56:55.954
Gentlemen,

694
00:56:56.663 --> 00:57:00.334
why is this word capitalised?

695
00:57:01.877 --> 00:57:03.795
Because it's important?

696
00:57:06.924 --> 00:57:08.759
Because it's a name.

697
00:57:09.718 --> 00:57:12.512
Okay, I got it. When Ben Franklin was
only 15 years old

698
00:57:12.596 --> 00:57:15.432
he secretly wrote 14 letters
to his brother's newspaper

699
00:57:15.515 --> 00:57:18.935
pretending to be a middle-aged widow
named Silence Dogood.

700
00:57:19.019 --> 00:57:21.855
These letters were written
by Benjamin Franklin.

701
00:57:29.196 --> 00:57:31.239
Looks okay.

702
00:57:31.323 --> 00:57:33.950
- Park a couple of blocks away.
- How long do you think we got?

703
00:57:34.034 --> 00:57:37.663
I'm gonna give them a couple of hours
at least. I hope.

704
00:57:37.746 --> 00:57:41.792
What do we do about her?
I've got some duct tape in the back.

705
00:57:41.875 --> 00:57:44.252
No, that won't be necessary.
She won't be any trouble.

706
00:57:44.336 --> 00:57:47.506
- Promise you won't be any trouble?
- I promise.

707
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:49.466
See? She's curious.

708
00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:54.429
<i>Here's what I got on Gates.</i>

709
00:57:54.513 --> 00:57:57.599
A degree in American History
from Georgetown,

710
00:57:57.683 --> 00:57:59.977
a degree in Mechanical Engineering
at MIT,

711
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:03.605
Navy ROTC and Naval Diving
and Salvage Training Centre.

712
00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:07.984
What in the world did this guy
want to be when he grew up?

713
00:58:08.068 --> 00:58:10.153
We keep our focus on Gates.

714
00:58:10.237 --> 00:58:11.905
Run him to ground.

715
00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:15.909
Compile a family-and-friends list.
Closest relative first.

716
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:19.413
I want to find out who this guy is.

717
00:58:28.255 --> 00:58:29.339
Dad.

718
00:58:31.925 --> 00:58:33.593
Where's the party?

719
00:58:34.594 --> 00:58:35.762
Well…

720
00:58:36.763 --> 00:58:39.182
I'm in a little trouble.

721
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:41.184
Is she pregnant?

722
00:58:41.268 --> 00:58:44.021
If she is, are you gonna leave
the woman carrying your grandchild

723
00:58:44.104 --> 00:58:46.523
standing out in the cold?

724
00:58:46.606 --> 00:58:48.233
I look pregnant?

725
00:58:53.613 --> 00:58:56.616
This better not be
about that dumb treasure.

726
00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:05.042
Well, have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

727
00:59:05.125 --> 00:59:08.086
There's some pizza.
It's still warm, I think.

728
00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.088
Dad.

729
00:59:12.424 --> 00:59:14.593
I need the Silence Dogood letters.

730
00:59:15.635 --> 00:59:17.471
Yeah, it's about the treasure.

731
00:59:17.554 --> 00:59:19.514
And he dragged you two
into this nonsense?

732
00:59:19.598 --> 00:59:22.142
- Literally.
- I volunteered.

733
00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:25.228
Well, unvolunteer,
before you waste your life.

734
00:59:25.312 --> 00:59:26.354
Knock it off, Dad.

735
00:59:26.438 --> 00:59:28.523
Sure, sure, I know, I'm the family kook.

736
00:59:28.607 --> 00:59:30.859
I have a job, a house, health insurance.

737
00:59:30.942 --> 00:59:33.904
At least I had your mother,
for however brief a time.

738
00:59:33.987 --> 00:59:35.447
At least I had you.

739
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:37.407
What do you have? Him?

740
00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:42.746
Look, if you just give us the letters,
we're gone.

741
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:44.831
You disappoint me, Ben.

742
00:59:44.915 --> 00:59:46.875
Well, maybe
that's the real Gates-family legacy.

743
00:59:46.958 --> 00:59:49.336
Sons who disappoint their fathers.

744
00:59:51.505 --> 00:59:54.132
Get out. Take your troubles with you.

745
00:59:59.513 --> 01:00:01.097
I found the <i>Charlotte.</i>

746
01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:07.896
The <i>Charlotte?</i>

747
01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:12.108
- You mean she was a ship?
- Yeah, and she was beautiful.

748
01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:13.485
It was amazing, Dad.

749
01:00:13.568 --> 01:00:14.945
And the treasure?

750
01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:18.949
No, no. But we found another clue
that led us here.

751
01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:21.743
Yeah, and that'll lead you
to another clue.

752
01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:23.346
And that's all you'll ever find,
is another clue.

753
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:24.370
Don't you get it, Ben?

754
01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:26.123
I finally figured it out.

755
01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:29.251
The legend says that the treasure
was buried to keep it from the British.

756
01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:32.128
But what really happened
was the legend was invented,

757
01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:36.299
to keep the British occupied
searching for buried treasure.

758
01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:38.176
Treasure is a myth.

759
01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.847
I refuse to believe that.

760
01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:49.938
Well, you can believe what you want.
You're a grown person.

761
01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:51.815
What am I doing?

762
01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:54.734
Do what you want, Ben.
Do what you want.

763
01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:57.696
He's probably right.

764
01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:00.740
You don't even know
if there is another clue.

765
01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:05.537
Well, I can think of a way
where we could find out.

766
01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.581
And we can find out right now.

767
01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:28.518
Looks like animal skin.

768
01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:30.604
How old is it?

769
01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:31.813
At least 200 years.

770
01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:34.024
Really? You sure?

771
01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:35.525
Pretty darn.

772
01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:38.486
Now if this thing's in invisible ink,
how do we look at it?

773
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:39.654
Throw it in the oven.

774
01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:41.239
No!

775
01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:44.034
Ferrous sulphate inks
can only be brought out with heat.

776
01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:47.370
- Yes, but this…
- It's very old.

777
01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:51.833
This is very old, and we can't risk
compromising the map.

778
01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.169
You need a reagent.

779
01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:57.047
Dad, it's really late.
Why don't you get some rest?

780
01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.423
I'm fine.

781
01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:00.800
Lemons.

782
01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:10.310
- You can't do that.
- But it has to be done.

783
01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:14.814
Then someone who is trained to handle
antique documents is gonna do it.

784
01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:16.983
Okay.

785
01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:20.820
Okay.

786
01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:25.867
Now, if there is a secret message,

787
01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:31.248
it'll probably be marked by a symbol
in the upper right-hand corner.

788
01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:32.791
That's right.

789
01:02:36.336 --> 01:02:38.713
I am so getting fired for this.

790
01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:12.747
I told you. You need heat.

791
01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:32.183
See?

792
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:37.647
- We need more juice.
- We need more heat.

793
01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.621
That's not a map.

794
01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:57.751
- Is it?
- More clues. What a surprise.

795
01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.377
Are those latitudes and longitudes?

796
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:01.880
That's why we need
the Silence Dogood letters.

797
01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:02.964
That's the key?

798
01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:05.008
Yeah. "The key in Silence undetected."

799
01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.885
Dad, can we have the letters now?

800
01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:11.431
Will somebody please explain to me
what these magic numbers are?

801
01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.850
- It's an Ottendorf cipher.
- That's right.

802
01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:15.185
Okay.

803
01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:18.855
- What's an Ottendorf cipher?
- They're just codes.

804
01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:23.193
Each of these three numbers
corresponds to a word in a key.

805
01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:26.154
Usually a random book
or a newspaper article.

806
01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:28.281
In this case,
the Silence Dogood letters.

807
01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:30.867
So it's like the page number
of the key text,

808
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:33.787
the line on the page,
and the letter in that line.

809
01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.873
So, Dad, where are the letters?

810
01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:39.876
You know,
it's just by sheer happenstance

811
01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:42.087
that his grandfather…

812
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.380
- Dad.
- …even found them.

813
01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.799
They were in an antique desk
from the press room…

814
01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:47.384
- Dad.
- …of <i>The New England Courant.</i>

815
01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:50.595
- That's a newspaper.
- Dad, where are the letters?

816
01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:52.597
I don't have them, son.

817
01:04:53.515 --> 01:04:55.850
- What?
- I don't have them.

818
01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.567
Where are they?

819
01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:07.821
I donated them to the Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia.

820
01:05:08.696 --> 01:05:10.115
Time to go.

821
01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:13.785
I still can't believe it. All…

822
01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:16.788
All this time
no one knew what was on the back.

823
01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:17.997
- The back of what?
- Whoa!

824
01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:19.165
No!

825
01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.085
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

826
01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:23.586
- I know.
- Oh, my God.

827
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.797
- What have you done? This is…
- I know!

828
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.425
This is the
Declaration of Independence.

829
01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:31.678
Yes. And it's very delicate.

830
01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:33.680
You stole it?

831
01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.723
Dad, I can explain,
but I don't have time.

832
01:05:35.807 --> 01:05:38.059
It was necessary.

833
01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:39.185
And you saw the cipher…

834
01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:42.039
And that will lead to another clue,
and that will lead to another clue!

835
01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:45.316
There is no treasure.
I wasted 20 years of my life.

836
01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.735
And now you've destroyed yours.

837
01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:51.364
And you pulled me into all this.

838
01:05:52.073 --> 01:05:53.867
We can't have that.

839
01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:00.623
Come in!

840
01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:03.668
I'm in here.

841
01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:06.713
FBI, right?

842
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:12.886
You gonna untie me?

843
01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:18.683
And you have no idea
where he's going?

844
01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:21.019
Well, wouldn't I have told you if I did?

845
01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:22.812
Would you?

846
01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:25.231
He tied me to a chair.

847
01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:26.316
The garage is empty,

848
01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:27.835
but there's
a Cadillac DeVille registered

849
01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:29.194
to Patrick Gates.

850
01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:31.070
And he stole my car.

851
01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:34.949
Don't worry, Mr Gates,
we'll find your car and your son.

852
01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:40.371
Your dad's got a sweet ride.

853
01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:42.999
I think we should change clothes.

854
01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:45.960
We look kind of conspicuous,
don't you think?

855
01:06:46.044 --> 01:06:49.297
I'd love to go shopping, too,
but we have no money.

856
01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.341
Here, I took this from his house.

857
01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:54.844
He usually tucks a few hundred dollars
somewhere between those pages.

858
01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:57.013
<i>"Common Sense."</i> How appropriate.

859
01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:00.350
When are we gonna get there?
I'm hungry.

860
01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:03.018
This car smells weird.

861
01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:48.648
Excuse me.

862
01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:52.360
Excuse me. Sorry, sir. Excuse me.

863
01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:53.820
That's okay.

864
01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:02.787
S-S-A-N-D.

865
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:03.997
Okay.

866
01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.209
You're sure this is right?

867
01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:11.588
Okay.

868
01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:14.382
S-S-A…

869
01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:16.551
No, "N."

870
01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:19.512
- That is an "N."
- It doesn't look like an "N."

871
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:24.684
You know what? Here. Last one. Okay?

872
01:08:26.311 --> 01:08:28.479
- One more dollar.
- Thank you.

873
01:08:29.147 --> 01:08:31.274
Go get the last four letters.

874
01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:33.526
Go get them, chief. Come on.

875
01:08:51.753 --> 01:08:56.424
Okay. "The vision to see
the treasured past

876
01:08:56.507 --> 01:09:02.388
"comes as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of pass and…"

877
01:09:02.847 --> 01:09:04.724
"Pass and…" what?

878
01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:20.782
"Pass and…"

879
01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:49.310
What's going on?

880
01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:54.482
- I'm not sure.
- What's up?

881
01:09:56.984 --> 01:10:00.113
So you show up at your father's door
and say you're in trouble

882
01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:03.449
and the first thing he assumes
is I'm pregnant.

883
01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:06.703
Is there a question in there?

884
01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:09.288
I think there's an interesting story
in there.

885
01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:13.418
Well, my father thinks I've been
a little too cavalier in my personal life.

886
01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:16.254
- I see.
- Let me ask you something.

887
01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:19.215
Have you ever told someone,
not a relative, "I love you"?

888
01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:20.383
Yes.

889
01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.761
More than one someone?

890
01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:26.389
Yes.

891
01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:30.119
Well, then my father would say
you've been a little too cavalier

892
01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:32.061
in your personal life, too.

893
01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:35.565
So you get your sense
of absolute certainty from him, do you?

894
01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:37.608
Well, I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

895
01:10:37.692 --> 01:10:42.447
Well, you're certain the treasure is real,
despite what anyone else thinks.

896
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:43.906
No, but I hope it's real.

897
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:48.661
I mean, I've dreamt it's real
since my grandfather told me about it.

898
01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:51.873
But I want to hold it.
I feel like I'm so close, I can taste it.

899
01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:53.541
But I just want to know

900
01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:56.836
it's not just something
in my head or in my heart.

901
01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:03.968
People don't really talk that way,
you know?

902
01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:06.679
I know. But they think that way.

903
01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:14.312
Hey.

904
01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:16.606
- Did you get it? Riley?
- I got it.

905
01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:19.609
"The vision to see the treasured past

906
01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:25.698
"comes as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of Pass and Stow."

907
01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:28.451
Now, "Pass and Stow," of course,
referring to…

908
01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:30.012
- The Liberty Bell.
- The Liberty Bell.

909
01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:31.579
Why do you have to do that?

910
01:11:31.662 --> 01:11:34.123
Well, John Pass and John Stow
cast the bell.

911
01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:37.418
Okay, well, then,
what does the rest of this mean?

912
01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:40.213
Wait. "The vision
to see the treasured past"

913
01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.298
must refer to a way to read the map.

914
01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:43.901
Well, I thought the cipher was the map.

915
01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:46.636
No, the cipher was a way
to find the way to read the map.

916
01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:48.721
And the way to read the map
can be found

917
01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:52.433
where the "timely shadow" crosses
in front of the Liberty Bell.

918
01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:56.562
Crosses in front of the "house"
of the Liberty Bell. Independence Hall.

919
01:11:56.646 --> 01:12:00.483
Right, so "timely shadow,"
it's a specific time.

920
01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:02.652
- Right.
- What time?

921
01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:05.404
What time? What time?

922
01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:09.617
Wait a minute, wait.
You're gonna love this.

923
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.246
Excuse me. Can I see one of those
$100 bills I paid you with?

924
01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:14.372
No.

925
01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:18.960
Well, here, I have this diver's watch.

926
01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:20.043
It's called a Submariner.

927
01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:21.730
I dive with it.
It's actually quite valuable.

928
01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.756
- You can use it as collateral.
- Whatever.

929
01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.383
Thank you.

930
01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:28.344
On the back of a $100 bill
is an etching of Independence Hall

931
01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:29.905
- based on a painting done in…
- Hello.

932
01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:32.139
Thank you. In the 1780s, who…

933
01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:35.810
The artist was actually a friend
of Benjamin Franklin's. It's wonderful.

934
01:12:35.893 --> 01:12:37.562
- Fascinating.
- Hold this.

935
01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:38.813
Okay.

936
01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:41.983
I'm not going anywhere.

937
01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:45.903
Now, I think that
if we look at this clock tower

938
01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:49.866
we may find the specific time.

939
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:55.997
- What do you see?
- 2:22.

940
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.125
- What time is it now?
- Almost three.

941
01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.420
We missed it.

942
01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:04.088
No, we didn't.

943
01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:06.340
We didn't miss it because…

944
01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:08.968
You don't know this?

945
01:13:09.677 --> 01:13:11.405
I know something
about history that you don't know.

946
01:13:11.429 --> 01:13:13.514
I'd be very excited
to learn about it, Riley.

947
01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:16.809
Well, hold on one second,
let me just take in this moment.

948
01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:19.562
This is cool.

949
01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:22.273
Is this how you feel all the time?
Because, you know…

950
01:13:22.356 --> 01:13:23.566
Except for now, of course.

951
01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:25.568
- Riley!
- All right.

952
01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:31.073
What I know is that daylight savings
wasn't established until World War I.

953
01:13:31.157 --> 01:13:33.576
If it's 3:00 p.m. now, okay,

954
01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:36.704
that means in 1776,
it would be 2:00 p.m.

955
01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:38.706
- Let's go.
- Riley, you're a genius.

956
01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:39.874
Yeah.

957
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:42.919
Do you actually know
who the first person

958
01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:44.754
to suggest daylight savings was?

959
01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:46.631
- Benjamin Franklin.
- Benjamin Franklin.

960
01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:49.675
Is this real?

961
01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:52.637
Just tell me what you told my friend.

962
01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.681
Just a bunch of letters.
I can't remember.

963
01:13:56.515 --> 01:14:00.186
Can you remember which ones
you were gonna tell him next?

964
01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:03.731
Yeah, here. S-T-O-W.

965
01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:15.660
Top results, Liberty Bell
and Independence Hall.

966
01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:23.417
Imagine its impact
back in the 18th century.

967
01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:25.461
It could have been seen
for miles around,

968
01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:27.380
which was exactly its purpose,

969
01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.423
because it served as a beacon,
as it were,

970
01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:31.592
for people to collect and hear…

971
01:14:46.947 --> 01:14:48.031
Good stuff.

972
01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:52.869
It gained a place in history
on July 8th, 1776,

973
01:14:53.036 --> 01:14:55.664
when the Liberty Bell tolled
for the first public reading

974
01:14:55.747 --> 01:14:58.000
of the Declaration of Independence.

975
01:14:58.083 --> 01:15:02.129
Eventually, it was moved from its place,
in Independence Hall steeple,

976
01:15:02.212 --> 01:15:03.588
- and given its own…
- Idiot.

977
01:15:03.672 --> 01:15:05.507
- Who?
- Any questions?

978
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:07.175
- Me.
- What?

979
01:15:07.259 --> 01:15:10.178
It's not here. It's there.

980
01:15:11.054 --> 01:15:12.305
Come on.

981
01:15:21.732 --> 01:15:23.984
- What bell is this?
- It's the Centennial Bell.

982
01:15:24.067 --> 01:15:26.361
It replaced the Liberty Bell in 1876.

983
01:15:34.995 --> 01:15:36.413
There it is.

984
01:15:37.289 --> 01:15:40.751
All right. I'm gonna go down there,
and you meet me in the signing room.

985
01:15:40.834 --> 01:15:43.128
- Okay? All right.
- Okay.

986
01:15:43.211 --> 01:15:45.046
All right, let's go.

987
01:15:45.839 --> 01:15:48.592
3:22. My idea.

988
01:16:54.741 --> 01:16:56.535
In 1778…

989
01:16:56.618 --> 01:16:58.620
Hey. What'd you score?

990
01:16:58.703 --> 01:17:00.163
I found this.

991
01:17:00.247 --> 01:17:02.040
Some kind of ocular device.

992
01:17:02.791 --> 01:17:05.126
"The vision to see the treasured past."

993
01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:06.294
Let me take this.

994
01:17:06.378 --> 01:17:10.132
They're like early American
X-ray specs.

995
01:17:10.215 --> 01:17:13.385
Benjamin Franklin invented
something like these.

996
01:17:14.302 --> 01:17:16.388
I think he invented these.

997
01:17:17.097 --> 01:17:19.266
So, what do we do with them?

998
01:17:19.349 --> 01:17:21.059
We look through it.

999
01:17:24.271 --> 01:17:25.814
Here, help me.

1000
01:17:27.566 --> 01:17:30.235
- Careful.
- You think?

1001
01:17:36.741 --> 01:17:40.245
- What?
- It's just that the last time this was here

1002
01:17:41.037 --> 01:17:42.914
it was being signed.

1003
01:17:46.168 --> 01:17:49.337
- Ben, there's another tour coming.
- Turn it over.

1004
01:17:49.838 --> 01:17:52.966
- Careful.
- Spectacles.

1005
01:18:04.436 --> 01:18:06.021
What do you see?

1006
01:18:09.274 --> 01:18:11.443
What is it? Is it a treasure map?

1007
01:18:12.152 --> 01:18:17.866
It says, "Heere at the wall,"
spelled with two "E'"s. Take a look.

1008
01:18:23.163 --> 01:18:24.497
Wow!

1009
01:18:24.581 --> 01:18:26.100
Why can't they just say,
"Go to this place,

1010
01:18:26.124 --> 01:18:29.002
"and here's the treasure,
spend it wisely"?

1011
01:18:29.586 --> 01:18:31.129
Oh, no.

1012
01:18:32.631 --> 01:18:34.216
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1013
01:18:36.092 --> 01:18:37.385
How did they find us?

1014
01:18:37.469 --> 01:18:41.389
Well, Ian has nearly
unlimited resources. And he's smart.

1015
01:18:41.473 --> 01:18:43.808
I don't think we can get out of here
without being spotted.

1016
01:18:43.892 --> 01:18:46.853
Well, we don't want them to have
the Declaration, or the glasses.

1017
01:18:46.937 --> 01:18:49.564
But we especially don't want them
to have them both together.

1018
01:18:49.648 --> 01:18:52.692
- So what do we do?
- We separate the lock from the key.

1019
01:18:52.776 --> 01:18:54.819
- We're splitting up.
- Good idea.

1020
01:18:54.903 --> 01:18:56.071
Really?

1021
01:18:56.154 --> 01:18:58.114
I'll take this.

1022
01:18:58.198 --> 01:19:00.075
And those. You keep that.

1023
01:19:00.158 --> 01:19:02.345
Meet me at the car
and call me if you have any problems.

1024
01:19:02.369 --> 01:19:05.121
Like if we get caught and killed?

1025
01:19:05.205 --> 01:19:08.750
Yeah. That would be a big problem.
Take care of her.

1026
01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:10.418
- I will.
- I will.

1027
01:19:19.761 --> 01:19:21.304
We're on him.

1028
01:19:24.015 --> 01:19:25.392
There he is.

1029
01:19:29.854 --> 01:19:32.941
- Let's walk this way.
- Wait up.

1030
01:19:33.024 --> 01:19:36.027
- Shaw, look. There's the others.
- I got it.

1031
01:19:37.904 --> 01:19:41.032
Viktor, meet me at Fifth and Chestnut.
Fifth and Chestnut.

1032
01:19:41.116 --> 01:19:42.826
They're heading your way.

1033
01:20:08.059 --> 01:20:09.769
- Look out! Look out!
- Riley!

1034
01:20:09.853 --> 01:20:11.855
- There they are! Move!
- Move!

1035
01:20:13.523 --> 01:20:16.651
- Time to run.
- Keep up, Viktor! Move. Come on.

1036
01:20:23.241 --> 01:20:24.534
In here.

1037
01:20:30.373 --> 01:20:32.292
- Come on.
- Follow me.

1038
01:20:37.797 --> 01:20:39.090
That way.

1039
01:20:46.848 --> 01:20:49.768
If you're not a steak,
you don't belong here.

1040
01:20:50.643 --> 01:20:53.897
I'm just trying to hide
from my ex-husband.

1041
01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:56.191
- Who, baldy?
- Yes.

1042
01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.694
Honey, stay as long as you like.

1043
01:20:59.778 --> 01:21:01.946
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1044
01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:03.823
You want something?

1045
01:21:09.913 --> 01:21:12.749
- Do you want something?
- Shut up.

1046
01:21:15.752 --> 01:21:17.379
I see why you left him.

1047
01:21:22.967 --> 01:21:24.761
Go around. Go around.

1048
01:21:30.475 --> 01:21:31.726
Gates!

1049
01:21:58.586 --> 01:21:59.963
Come on!

1050
01:22:10.598 --> 01:22:12.725
- Where were you?
- Hiding.

1051
01:22:12.809 --> 01:22:14.936
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

1052
01:22:20.316 --> 01:22:23.444
Ian. Ian, I've got them.
They're heading toward City Hall.

1053
01:22:23.528 --> 01:22:26.156
- Okay, I'm on my way.
- Out of the way!

1054
01:22:55.393 --> 01:22:57.204
They're headed for the breezeway
on the north side.

1055
01:22:57.228 --> 01:22:58.271
I'll be right there.

1056
01:23:07.655 --> 01:23:09.073
Hey, Gates!

1057
01:23:15.496 --> 01:23:18.458
Enough, man! Give me the document.

1058
01:23:20.001 --> 01:23:21.586
All right, Phil.

1059
01:23:38.937 --> 01:23:40.522
Watch out! Get out of my way!

1060
01:23:40.605 --> 01:23:42.106
Watch it!

1061
01:23:45.610 --> 01:23:46.903
Watch it!

1062
01:24:29.571 --> 01:24:31.531
Leave them! Let them go.

1063
01:24:34.826 --> 01:24:36.369
We've got it.

1064
01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:40.748
- FBI. Have you seen this guy?
- No.

1065
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.751
Nope, I haven't seen him.

1066
01:24:43.835 --> 01:24:46.879
Ted. Philadelphia police
found Gates' car.

1067
01:24:46.963 --> 01:24:49.299
It's close.
We got surveillance there now.

1068
01:24:49.382 --> 01:24:52.010
Let's go. Tell the boss we got the car.

1069
01:24:54.679 --> 01:24:56.264
- What?
<i>- We lost it.</i>

1070
01:24:56.347 --> 01:24:59.392
- What?
<i>- We lost the Declaration. Ian took It.</i>

1071
01:25:02.186 --> 01:25:04.355
Yeah, okay. You all right?

1072
01:25:04.439 --> 01:25:07.734
<i>- You both all right?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, we're all right.

1073
01:25:07.817 --> 01:25:10.695
- Ben, I'm sorry.
<i>- We'll be fine.</i>

1074
01:25:10.778 --> 01:25:12.655
Meet me at the car.

1075
01:25:19.537 --> 01:25:21.289
Suspect has arrived.

1076
01:25:24.876 --> 01:25:26.544
Hello, Mr Gates.

1077
01:25:27.670 --> 01:25:28.950
Mr Gates, face your father's car

1078
01:25:29.005 --> 01:25:31.007
and put your hands
behind your back, please.

1079
01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:34.552
- We got one in custody.
- Gates, you're a hard man to find.

1080
01:25:34.636 --> 01:25:37.555
- Could you please be careful?
- I've got it.

1081
01:25:50.568 --> 01:25:53.696
Riley, do you know
how to get in touch with Ian?

1082
01:25:56.115 --> 01:25:57.450
Excuse me?

1083
01:26:02.497 --> 01:26:03.665
That's some story.

1084
01:26:03.748 --> 01:26:05.833
Well, it's the same story
I tried to tell you guys

1085
01:26:05.917 --> 01:26:07.502
before the Declaration was stolen.

1086
01:26:07.585 --> 01:26:11.381
- By you?
- No, by Ian. I stole it to stop him.

1087
01:26:11.464 --> 01:26:14.425
I did it alone.
Dr Chase was not involved.

1088
01:26:15.259 --> 01:26:18.513
And Ian still ended up
with the Declaration of Independence.

1089
01:26:18.596 --> 01:26:20.098
Because of you.

1090
01:26:21.599 --> 01:26:23.559
So here's your options.

1091
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:28.147
Door number one,
you go to prison for a very long time.

1092
01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.691
Door number two,

1093
01:26:30.775 --> 01:26:33.945
we are going to get back
the Declaration of Independence.

1094
01:26:34.028 --> 01:26:38.282
You help us find it, and you still
go to prison for a very long time,

1095
01:26:38.991 --> 01:26:41.452
but you feel better inside.

1096
01:26:41.536 --> 01:26:44.455
Is there a door
that doesn't lead to prison?

1097
01:26:45.623 --> 01:26:48.459
- Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.
- Yeah.

1098
01:26:51.337 --> 01:26:53.548
So what are these for?

1099
01:26:53.631 --> 01:26:55.883
It's a way to read the map.

1100
01:26:55.967 --> 01:26:57.385
Right.

1101
01:26:57.468 --> 01:26:59.178
Knights Templar.

1102
01:26:59.262 --> 01:27:00.555
Freemasons.

1103
01:27:00.638 --> 01:27:02.598
Invisible treasure map.

1104
01:27:03.724 --> 01:27:06.477
- So what'd it say?
- "Heere at the wall."

1105
01:27:07.645 --> 01:27:09.188
Nothing else.

1106
01:27:10.273 --> 01:27:12.608
It's just another clue.

1107
01:27:12.692 --> 01:27:15.236
It looks like Ian Howe
could be a false identity.

1108
01:27:15.319 --> 01:27:17.572
Follow up with ATF and INS.

1109
01:27:18.656 --> 01:27:20.408
There's more to it.

1110
01:27:21.492 --> 01:27:23.554
- Standard tap procedure…
- Let's check the signal, folks.

1111
01:27:23.578 --> 01:27:25.830
- Lock it in.
- Are we set?

1112
01:27:25.913 --> 01:27:28.332
- Checking source.
- Unknown number.

1113
01:27:32.503 --> 01:27:33.754
Yes.

1114
01:27:33.838 --> 01:27:36.466
<i>Hello, Ben. How are you?</i>

1115
01:27:37.216 --> 01:27:40.428
- Chained to a desk.
<i>- Sorry to hear that.</i>

1116
01:27:40.511 --> 01:27:43.097
I want you to meet me
on the flight deck of the <i>USS Intrepid.</i>

1117
01:27:43.181 --> 01:27:45.725
<i>- You know where that is?</i>
- New York.

1118
01:27:45.808 --> 01:27:48.144
Meet me there at 10:00
tomorrow morning.

1119
01:27:48.227 --> 01:27:51.272
And bring those glasses
you found at Independence Hall.

1120
01:27:51.355 --> 01:27:53.691
<i>Yeah, I know about the glasses.</i>

1121
01:27:54.775 --> 01:27:58.613
We can take a look at the Declaration,
and then you can be on your way.

1122
01:27:58.696 --> 01:28:00.448
And I'm supposed to believe that.

1123
01:28:00.531 --> 01:28:03.743
<i>I told you from the start,
I only wanted to borrow It.</i>

1124
01:28:03.826 --> 01:28:05.912
You can have it. And the glasses.

1125
01:28:05.995 --> 01:28:09.040
<i>I'll even throw In the pipe
from the</i> Charlotte.

1126
01:28:09.749 --> 01:28:11.459
I'll be there.

1127
01:28:11.542 --> 01:28:14.879
<i>And tell the FBI agents
listening In on this call</i>

1128
01:28:14.962 --> 01:28:18.883
<i>if they want the Declaration back,
and not just a box of confetti,</i>

1129
01:28:18.966 --> 01:28:20.885
then you'll come alone.

1130
01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:35.358
<i>Take positions.</i>

1131
01:28:35.441 --> 01:28:37.193
<i>Perimeter looks normal.</i>

1132
01:28:37.276 --> 01:28:38.361
<i>Can I get a status report?</i>

1133
01:28:38.444 --> 01:28:40.863
<i>Crow's nest in position.
Port side is quiet.</i>

1134
01:28:40.947 --> 01:28:42.240
<i>Copy that.</i>

1135
01:28:51.999 --> 01:28:55.670
- Gates is on the flight deck.
- Eyes on Gates.

1136
01:28:55.753 --> 01:28:58.965
<i>- Do not lose sight of primary mark.
- Brian, you're clear with NYPD.</i>

1137
01:28:59.048 --> 01:29:01.300
- I have a visual.
- Gates.

1138
01:29:01.384 --> 01:29:02.718
<i>Stay with the programme.</i>

1139
01:29:02.802 --> 01:29:05.012
I hope your agents
are all under four feet tall

1140
01:29:05.096 --> 01:29:06.472
and wearing little scarves.

1141
01:29:06.556 --> 01:29:08.224
Otherwise,
Ian's gonna know they're here.

1142
01:29:08.307 --> 01:29:11.060
<i>As soon as he shows you
the Declaration, we'll move in.</i>

1143
01:29:11.143 --> 01:29:14.021
Don't try anything. Just let us handle it.

1144
01:29:14.105 --> 01:29:18.192
You know, Agent Sadusky,
something I've noticed about fishing,

1145
01:29:18.276 --> 01:29:20.987
it never works out so well for the bait.

1146
01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:31.956
Sir, we've got some traffic incoming.
Looks like a sightseeing helicopter.

1147
01:29:32.582 --> 01:29:35.084
Unit two,
get an eyeball on that chopper.

1148
01:29:35.167 --> 01:29:38.462
Agent Michaels, get FAA flight plans
and authorisation records on that craft.

1149
01:29:38.546 --> 01:29:41.632
If that's not Mr Howe,
I want to know who it is.

1150
01:29:41.716 --> 01:29:44.260
I got him. He's coming from the north.

1151
01:29:44.343 --> 01:29:46.053
Gates, are you with me?

1152
01:29:46.137 --> 01:29:49.473
Well, I'm sure not against you,
if that's what you're asking.

1153
01:30:12.955 --> 01:30:15.708
We've got some interference
on Gates' mike, sir.

1154
01:30:15.791 --> 01:30:17.251
This I know.

1155
01:30:18.419 --> 01:30:20.129
Hello, Ben.

1156
01:30:21.005 --> 01:30:24.592
Thomas Edison needed only one way
to make a light bulb.

1157
01:30:24.675 --> 01:30:26.260
Sound familiar?

1158
01:30:28.846 --> 01:30:30.222
<i>Keep sightlines clear.</i>

1159
01:30:30.306 --> 01:30:31.974
<i>What the devil's going on up there?</i>

1160
01:30:32.058 --> 01:30:33.225
<i>I can't see Gates.</i>

1161
01:30:33.309 --> 01:30:36.479
Go to the starboard observation point
behind the F-16

1162
01:30:36.562 --> 01:30:38.522
and here's what you do.

1163
01:30:39.315 --> 01:30:40.942
Gates? Gates?

1164
01:30:41.025 --> 01:30:44.111
<i>Air Tour helicopter,
you are in controlled airspace.</i>

1165
01:30:44.195 --> 01:30:46.155
<i>Vacate immediately.</i>

1166
01:30:46.238 --> 01:30:47.740
<i>Who's got him? Who's got Gates?</i>

1167
01:30:47.823 --> 01:30:49.468
<i>- All agents, report in.
- I can't see anything.</i>

1168
01:30:49.492 --> 01:30:52.036
<i>- My position is taken.
- Did Gates speak to anybody?</i>

1169
01:30:52.119 --> 01:30:53.496
Target is moving.

1170
01:30:53.579 --> 01:30:55.331
He's heading towards the stern.

1171
01:30:55.414 --> 01:30:57.792
<i>I've got him. He's coming this way.</i>

1172
01:30:57.875 --> 01:30:59.835
Anyone got a view
of our friend Ian Howe?

1173
01:30:59.919 --> 01:31:01.837
Ian Howe is not at the stern, sir.

1174
01:31:01.921 --> 01:31:04.298
<i>Then why is he heading there?</i>

1175
01:31:05.174 --> 01:31:07.385
<i>He's at the observation deck.</i>

1176
01:31:08.552 --> 01:31:09.929
Sadusky.

1177
01:31:10.012 --> 01:31:11.972
<i>I'm still not against you.</i>

1178
01:31:12.056 --> 01:31:15.559
But I found door number three.
And I'm taking it.

1179
01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:17.978
- What's he talking about?
- Move in!

1180
01:31:18.062 --> 01:31:20.106
<i>Move in! Move in on Gates!</i>

1181
01:31:30.282 --> 01:31:31.927
<i>- Divers are a go.</i>
- Snipers, go to action zebra.

1182
01:31:31.951 --> 01:31:34.120
All teams, move in. Pursue at own risk.

1183
01:31:34.203 --> 01:31:36.872
<i>- I repeat, pursue at own risk.</i>
- You first.

1184
01:31:36.956 --> 01:31:39.417
Holy mackerel. He set us up.

1185
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:05.860
<i>Agent Dawes, do you have a visual?
Can you see Gates in the water?</i>

1186
01:32:05.943 --> 01:32:08.779
Sir, it's the Hudson. Nothing is visible.

1187
01:32:09.697 --> 01:32:11.073
Smart fish.

1188
01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.385
Hello, Ben.

1189
01:32:31.469 --> 01:32:33.304
Welcome to New Jersey.

1190
01:32:34.138 --> 01:32:36.724
- What'd you do with Abigail and Riley?
- Hope these fit.

1191
01:32:36.807 --> 01:32:38.559
We had to guess your sizes.

1192
01:32:38.642 --> 01:32:40.728
I said, what'd you do
with Abigail and Riley?

1193
01:32:40.811 --> 01:32:43.248
He's the only one who could've
told you that line about Edison.

1194
01:32:43.272 --> 01:32:44.899
Did you bring the glasses?

1195
01:32:44.982 --> 01:32:47.193
I don't know.
Tell me what's happening here.

1196
01:32:47.276 --> 01:32:49.403
Ask your girlfriend.

1197
01:32:49.487 --> 01:32:52.156
She's the one calling all the shots now.

1198
01:32:52.239 --> 01:32:53.908
She won't shut up.

1199
01:32:58.287 --> 01:32:59.663
Yeah, hello.

1200
01:33:00.831 --> 01:33:02.291
It's for you.

1201
01:33:03.501 --> 01:33:05.669
- Hello.
<i>- Hi, sweetie.</i>

1202
01:33:05.753 --> 01:33:07.463
How's your day going?

1203
01:33:08.005 --> 01:33:09.757
Interesting, dear.

1204
01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:12.718
So, what, you working with Ian now?

1205
01:33:12.802 --> 01:33:16.722
It turns out helping someone escape
from FBI custody is a criminal act.

1206
01:33:16.806 --> 01:33:18.557
And he's the only criminal we knew.

1207
01:33:18.641 --> 01:33:21.519
<i>- So we called him and made a deal.</i>
- Well, you're…

1208
01:33:23.729 --> 01:33:25.564
You're all right, yeah?
I mean you're safe?

1209
01:33:25.648 --> 01:33:27.316
<i>Yeah, we both are.</i>

1210
01:33:28.025 --> 01:33:31.487
Riley's right here, doing
something clever with a computer.

1211
01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:32.947
I'm tracking him through the…

1212
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:35.950
Hey! I'm tracking you
through the GPS in Shaw's phone.

1213
01:33:36.033 --> 01:33:38.452
They take a turn anywhere
we don't want, we'll know it.

1214
01:33:38.536 --> 01:33:39.536
So don't worry.

1215
01:33:39.578 --> 01:33:41.622
If Ian tries to double-cross us,

1216
01:33:41.705 --> 01:33:45.000
we can call the FBI
and tell them right where you are.

1217
01:33:45.084 --> 01:33:48.128
- And where to find Ian.
<i>- And where is that?</i>

1218
01:33:48.212 --> 01:33:50.256
Right across the street
from where we're hiding,

1219
01:33:50.339 --> 01:33:52.675
at the intersection
of Wall Street and Broadway.

1220
01:33:52.758 --> 01:33:55.261
Well, you figured out the clue.

1221
01:33:55.344 --> 01:33:58.722
<i>Simple. "Heere at the wall."
Wall Street and Broadway.</i>

1222
01:34:01.767 --> 01:34:03.978
Ben, there is a catch.

1223
01:34:04.061 --> 01:34:06.772
We made Ian believe
he could have the treasure.

1224
01:34:06.856 --> 01:34:09.149
<i>It was the only way
we could get this far.</i>

1225
01:34:09.233 --> 01:34:10.734
He's here.

1226
01:34:18.868 --> 01:34:20.244
Here we go.

1227
01:34:25.499 --> 01:34:27.334
Ben. You all right?

1228
01:34:28.294 --> 01:34:30.254
No broken bones?

1229
01:34:30.337 --> 01:34:31.755
A jump like that could kill a man.

1230
01:34:31.839 --> 01:34:34.758
No, it was cool.
You should try it sometime.

1231
01:34:37.094 --> 01:34:40.681
The Declaration of Independence.
And the meerschaum pipe.

1232
01:34:41.432 --> 01:34:42.766
All yours.

1233
01:34:44.351 --> 01:34:46.604
- That's it?
- That's it.

1234
01:34:47.855 --> 01:34:50.274
I knew you'd keep your promise.

1235
01:34:50.357 --> 01:34:52.234
Now, where is it?
Where's my treasure?

1236
01:34:52.318 --> 01:34:53.903
It's right here.

1237
01:34:53.986 --> 01:34:57.198
The map said "Heere at the wall,"
spelled with two "E'"s.

1238
01:34:57.281 --> 01:34:59.992
Wall Street follows the path
of an actual wall

1239
01:35:00.075 --> 01:35:03.621
that the original Dutch settlers built
as a defence to keep the British out.

1240
01:35:03.704 --> 01:35:07.833
The main gate was located at a street
called de Heere, also two "E'''s.

1241
01:35:07.917 --> 01:35:10.562
Later de Heere Street was renamed
Broadway after the British got in.

1242
01:35:10.586 --> 01:35:12.546
So, "Heere at the wall."

1243
01:35:13.297 --> 01:35:15.215
Broadway, Wall Street.

1244
01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.010
Cheerio.

1245
01:35:20.054 --> 01:35:21.722
Just a moment, Ben.

1246
01:35:21.805 --> 01:35:26.602
Ian, if you break our deal, the FBI
will be only a few minutes behind you.

1247
01:35:26.685 --> 01:35:29.146
You might get away, you might not.

1248
01:35:33.067 --> 01:35:35.152
Is that all the map said?

1249
01:35:37.154 --> 01:35:38.530
Every word.

1250
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:42.743
Oh, Ben.

1251
01:35:43.827 --> 01:35:47.081
You know the key
to running a convincing bluff?

1252
01:35:47.164 --> 01:35:50.960
Every once in a while
you've got to be holding all the cards.

1253
01:36:01.804 --> 01:36:03.013
Dad.

1254
01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:09.061
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

1255
01:36:13.023 --> 01:36:16.443
Trinity Church.
We have to go inside Trinity Church.

1256
01:36:19.738 --> 01:36:21.365
Good. Excellent.

1257
01:36:22.157 --> 01:36:25.160
Well, why don't you ask
Dr Chase and Riley to join us?

1258
01:36:25.244 --> 01:36:27.913
I'm sure
they're around here somewhere.

1259
01:36:33.627 --> 01:36:35.296
Are you all right?

1260
01:36:36.213 --> 01:36:38.632
What do you think? I'm a hostage.

1261
01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:41.802
Sit. Sit down.

1262
01:36:42.428 --> 01:36:45.514
- Let him go, Ian.
- When we find the treasure.

1263
01:36:45.597 --> 01:36:50.227
No, now. Or you can figure out
the clues for yourself.

1264
01:36:50.311 --> 01:36:52.062
Good luck.

1265
01:36:52.146 --> 01:36:53.564
Ben.

1266
01:36:53.647 --> 01:36:57.609
I don't think you fully appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

1267
01:37:06.118 --> 01:37:08.370
Let's have a look at that map.

1268
01:37:44.782 --> 01:37:46.033
{\an8}It's...

1269
01:37:48.118 --> 01:37:50.245
It's really quite something.

1270
01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:53.665
It really is remarkable. Take a look.

1271
01:37:59.922 --> 01:38:03.008
- "Parkington Lane."
- "Beneath Parkington Lane."

1272
01:38:03.967 --> 01:38:08.138
But why would the map lead us here,
then take us somewhere else?

1273
01:38:08.222 --> 01:38:10.516
- What's the purpose?
- Just another clue.

1274
01:38:10.599 --> 01:38:11.642
Dad.

1275
01:38:11.725 --> 01:38:15.479
No, you're right. Parkington Lane
has to be here somewhere.

1276
01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.066
A street inside the church?

1277
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:21.318
Not inside. Beneath.

1278
01:38:22.069 --> 01:38:23.529
Beneath the church.

1279
01:38:28.325 --> 01:38:30.828
- I'm so sorry, Ben.
- None of this is your fault.

1280
01:38:30.911 --> 01:38:32.703
- I could…
- Come on.

1281
01:38:41.672 --> 01:38:42.798
Look.

1282
01:38:44.633 --> 01:38:48.595
Cooperation only lasts as long
as the status quo is unchanged.

1283
01:38:48.679 --> 01:38:52.015
As soon as this guy
gets to wherever this thing ends,

1284
01:38:52.099 --> 01:38:54.935
he won't need you anymore
or any of us.

1285
01:38:55.018 --> 01:38:58.814
So we find a way to make sure
the status quo changes in our favour.

1286
01:38:58.897 --> 01:38:59.982
How?

1287
01:39:01.275 --> 01:39:03.068
I'm still working on it.

1288
01:39:03.152 --> 01:39:05.988
Well, I guess I better
work on it too, then.

1289
01:39:06.071 --> 01:39:08.782
Hey! Par… Hey, I found it!

1290
01:39:08.866 --> 01:39:10.200
- Him!
- Ben!

1291
01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.536
It's a name.

1292
01:39:16.165 --> 01:39:17.875
Parkington Lane.

1293
01:39:17.958 --> 01:39:21.587
He was a third-degree master mason
of the Blue…

1294
01:39:21.670 --> 01:39:23.172
Hey! Stop!

1295
01:39:38.061 --> 01:39:39.146
Easy.

1296
01:39:40.731 --> 01:39:42.065
Whoa!

1297
01:39:43.317 --> 01:39:45.152
Careful no one steps in him.

1298
01:39:45.235 --> 01:39:47.196
All right, put it down.

1299
01:39:54.578 --> 01:39:59.124
Okay. Who wants to go down
the creepy tunnel inside the tomb first?

1300
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:02.044
Right.

1301
01:40:02.127 --> 01:40:05.130
McGregor, Viktor, you stay here.

1302
01:40:05.214 --> 01:40:08.467
And if anyone
should come out without me,

1303
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:10.844
well, use your imagination.

1304
01:40:13.847 --> 01:40:15.265
Shall we?

1305
01:40:33.617 --> 01:40:35.285
You got a light?

1306
01:40:53.136 --> 01:40:54.388
Careful.

1307
01:40:55.305 --> 01:40:57.015
Watch your step.

1308
01:41:03.522 --> 01:41:04.982
Come here.

1309
01:41:14.825 --> 01:41:17.244
Why does that never happen to me?

1310
01:41:23.292 --> 01:41:24.793
What's this?

1311
01:41:40.851 --> 01:41:42.519
It's a chandelier.

1312
01:41:52.195 --> 01:41:53.447
Here.

1313
01:42:09.379 --> 01:42:11.506
- Wow.
- Look at the elevators.

1314
01:42:12.215 --> 01:42:13.508
A dumbwaiter system.

1315
01:42:13.592 --> 01:42:16.428
How do a bunch of guys
with hand tools build all this?

1316
01:42:16.511 --> 01:42:20.390
Same way they built the pyramids
and the Great Wall of China.

1317
01:42:20.474 --> 01:42:23.393
Yeah. The aliens helped them.

1318
01:42:23.477 --> 01:42:25.854
Right, let's go.
What are we waiting for?

1319
01:42:25.937 --> 01:42:30.275
I'm not going out on that thing.
200 years of termite damage and rot.

1320
01:42:30.359 --> 01:42:32.402
Dad, do what he says.

1321
01:42:52.506 --> 01:42:54.299
Watch your step.

1322
01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.512
We're right under the Trinity graveyard.

1323
01:42:58.595 --> 01:43:01.765
That's probably why
no one ever found this.

1324
01:43:05.936 --> 01:43:07.521
What is that?

1325
01:43:12.526 --> 01:43:13.777
Subway.

1326
01:43:19.825 --> 01:43:22.285
No! Shaw! Oh, God, Shaw!

1327
01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:34.798
Oh, my God.

1328
01:43:39.761 --> 01:43:41.513
Hold on! Hold on!

1329
01:43:44.724 --> 01:43:47.060
Okay, get on the elevator. Jump!

1330
01:43:50.355 --> 01:43:52.482
Ben! Grab my hand.

1331
01:43:54.735 --> 01:43:56.570
- Come on.
- Ian!

1332
01:43:56.653 --> 01:43:58.321
Abigail! Get on!

1333
01:44:02.868 --> 01:44:03.994
Jump!

1334
01:44:14.379 --> 01:44:15.505
Here.

1335
01:44:23.889 --> 01:44:24.973
Ben!

1336
01:44:26.016 --> 01:44:28.477
Get down there. Get down there!

1337
01:44:33.899 --> 01:44:35.525
The Declaration.

1338
01:44:38.945 --> 01:44:40.989
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

1339
01:44:55.212 --> 01:44:56.713
Oh, no! Ben!

1340
01:45:03.428 --> 01:45:04.846
Hang on!

1341
01:45:13.772 --> 01:45:14.856
Son!

1342
01:45:22.906 --> 01:45:26.576
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I dropped you.
I had to save the Declaration.

1343
01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:30.497
No, don't be. I would have done
exactly the same thing to you.

1344
01:45:31.414 --> 01:45:32.707
Really?

1345
01:45:33.542 --> 01:45:36.169
I would have dropped you both.

1346
01:45:36.253 --> 01:45:37.546
Freaks.

1347
01:45:44.719 --> 01:45:45.929
Get on.

1348
01:45:47.097 --> 01:45:48.306
Ian,

1349
01:45:49.307 --> 01:45:51.309
it's not worth it.

1350
01:45:51.393 --> 01:45:56.314
Do you imagine any one of your lives
is more valuable to me than Shaw's?

1351
01:45:56.398 --> 01:45:57.649
We go on.

1352
01:45:59.317 --> 01:46:00.902
The status quo.

1353
01:46:01.945 --> 01:46:03.697
Keep the status quo.

1354
01:46:10.954 --> 01:46:12.789
- Now what?
- This is…

1355
01:46:14.291 --> 01:46:16.376
This is where it all leads.

1356
01:46:26.595 --> 01:46:28.138
Okay, let's go.

1357
01:47:11.556 --> 01:47:13.016
What is this?

1358
01:47:14.184 --> 01:47:16.144
So where's the treasure?

1359
01:47:19.481 --> 01:47:20.565
Well?

1360
01:47:22.525 --> 01:47:23.902
This is it?

1361
01:47:24.861 --> 01:47:27.364
We came all this way for a dead end?

1362
01:47:28.531 --> 01:47:29.699
Yes.

1363
01:47:33.244 --> 01:47:35.955
- There's gotta be something more.
- Riley, there's nothing more.

1364
01:47:36.039 --> 01:47:38.500
- Another clue…
- No, there are no more clues!

1365
01:47:38.583 --> 01:47:40.377
That's it, okay? It's over!

1366
01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:44.673
End of the road. The treasure's gone.
Moved. Taken somewhere else.

1367
01:47:45.674 --> 01:47:48.718
You're not playing games with me,
are you, Ben?

1368
01:47:49.719 --> 01:47:51.554
You know where it is.

1369
01:47:52.847 --> 01:47:53.890
No.

1370
01:47:58.186 --> 01:47:59.479
Okay, go.

1371
01:48:00.605 --> 01:48:02.357
Hey, wait a minute.

1372
01:48:03.733 --> 01:48:06.027
- Hey! Ian, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1373
01:48:06.111 --> 01:48:07.821
- Ian…
- We'll be trapped.

1374
01:48:07.904 --> 01:48:10.323
- Don't do this.
- You can't just leave us here.

1375
01:48:10.407 --> 01:48:14.327
Yes, I can.
Unless Ben tells me the next clue.

1376
01:48:14.411 --> 01:48:16.705
There isn't another clue.

1377
01:48:16.788 --> 01:48:19.582
Ian, listen, why don't you
come back down here

1378
01:48:19.666 --> 01:48:21.251
and we can talk through this together?

1379
01:48:21.334 --> 01:48:23.420
- Don't speak again.
- Okay.

1380
01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:28.466
The clue. Where's the treasure?

1381
01:48:30.552 --> 01:48:31.761
Ben?

1382
01:48:34.681 --> 01:48:36.599
- The lantern.
- Dad…

1383
01:48:38.601 --> 01:48:40.645
The status quo has changed, son.

1384
01:48:40.729 --> 01:48:41.938
Don't.

1385
01:48:45.108 --> 01:48:47.485
It's part of Freemason teachings.

1386
01:48:49.446 --> 01:48:52.532
In King Solomon's temple
there was a winding staircase.

1387
01:48:52.615 --> 01:48:57.203
It signified the journey that had to be
made to find the light of truth.

1388
01:48:58.747 --> 01:49:01.916
- The lantern is the clue.
- And what does it mean?

1389
01:49:02.625 --> 01:49:04.919
Boston. It's Boston.

1390
01:49:05.003 --> 01:49:06.755
The Old North Church in Boston,

1391
01:49:06.838 --> 01:49:10.550
where Thomas Newton
hung a lantern in the steeple,

1392
01:49:10.633 --> 01:49:13.053
to signal Paul Revere
that the British were coming.

1393
01:49:13.136 --> 01:49:15.805
"One if by land, two if by sea."
One lantern.

1394
01:49:15.889 --> 01:49:17.891
Under the winding staircase
of the steeple,

1395
01:49:17.974 --> 01:49:19.726
that's where we have to look.

1396
01:49:19.809 --> 01:49:23.354
- Thank you.
- Hey, you have to take us with you.

1397
01:49:23.438 --> 01:49:26.441
Why? So you can escape in Boston?

1398
01:49:26.524 --> 01:49:30.070
Besides, with you out of the picture
there's less baggage to carry.

1399
01:49:30.153 --> 01:49:31.988
What if we lied?

1400
01:49:32.614 --> 01:49:33.615
Did you?

1401
01:49:33.698 --> 01:49:35.992
What if there's another clue?

1402
01:49:36.785 --> 01:49:39.579
Then I'll know right where to find you.

1403
01:49:40.497 --> 01:49:41.998
See you, Ben.

1404
01:49:45.126 --> 01:49:46.920
- No!
- There's no other way out!

1405
01:49:47.003 --> 01:49:49.839
- Come back!
- You're gonna need us, Ian!

1406
01:49:49.964 --> 01:49:51.716
We're all gonna die.

1407
01:49:52.509 --> 01:49:56.262
It's gonna be okay, Riley.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1408
01:49:56.346 --> 01:49:58.681
It's okay, kiddo.

1409
01:49:58.765 --> 01:50:00.600
Okay, boys, what's going on?

1410
01:50:00.683 --> 01:50:04.312
The British came by sea.
It was two lanterns, not one.

1411
01:50:04.395 --> 01:50:07.607
Ian needed another clue,
so we gave it to him.

1412
01:50:07.690 --> 01:50:10.360
It was a fake. It was a fake clue.

1413
01:50:11.027 --> 01:50:12.737
The all-seeing eye.

1414
01:50:13.530 --> 01:50:15.782
"Through the all-seeing eye."

1415
01:50:16.574 --> 01:50:19.619
That means by the time Ian
figures it out and comes back here,

1416
01:50:19.702 --> 01:50:23.039
we'll still be trapped,
and he'll shoot us then.

1417
01:50:23.957 --> 01:50:26.084
Either way we're gonna die.

1418
01:50:27.418 --> 01:50:30.547
Nobody's gonna die.
There's another way out.

1419
01:50:31.297 --> 01:50:32.549
Where?

1420
01:50:32.632 --> 01:50:34.384
Through the treasure room.

1421
01:50:41.891 --> 01:50:42.976
Here.

1422
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:54.737
Riley.

1423
01:51:21.973 --> 01:51:25.018
Looks like someone got here first.

1424
01:51:26.686 --> 01:51:28.229
I'm sorry, Ben.

1425
01:51:29.272 --> 01:51:30.607
It's gone.

1426
01:51:33.651 --> 01:51:35.195
Listen, Ben…

1427
01:51:35.278 --> 01:51:36.404
It may have even been gone

1428
01:51:36.487 --> 01:51:39.949
before Charles Carroll
told the story to Thomas Gates.

1429
01:51:41.534 --> 01:51:43.202
It doesn't matter.

1430
01:51:43.745 --> 01:51:45.830
I know. 'Cause you were right.

1431
01:51:46.789 --> 01:51:48.499
No, I wasn't right.

1432
01:51:49.709 --> 01:51:51.669
This room is real, Ben.

1433
01:51:52.462 --> 01:51:55.215
And that means the treasure is real.

1434
01:51:55.298 --> 01:51:57.902
We're in the company of some
of the most brilliant minds in history,

1435
01:51:57.926 --> 01:52:02.096
because you found
what they left behind for us to find

1436
01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:04.682
and understood the meaning of it.

1437
01:52:04.766 --> 01:52:07.185
You did it, Ben. For all of us.

1438
01:52:08.686 --> 01:52:11.648
Your grandfather, and all of us.

1439
01:52:12.482 --> 01:52:15.652
And I've never been so happy
to be proven wrong.

1440
01:52:26.829 --> 01:52:28.122
I just

1441
01:52:29.123 --> 01:52:32.043
really thought
I was gonna find the treasure.

1442
01:52:34.170 --> 01:52:35.296
Okay.

1443
01:52:36.089 --> 01:52:38.508
Then we just keep looking for it.

1444
01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:43.429
I'm in.

1445
01:52:48.935 --> 01:52:50.061
Okay.

1446
01:52:52.355 --> 01:52:55.608
Not to be Johnny Rain Cloud here,
but that's not gonna happen.

1447
01:52:55.692 --> 01:52:59.070
Because as far as I can see,
we're still trapped down here.

1448
01:52:59.153 --> 01:53:00.822
- Yeah.
- Hell.

1449
01:53:01.489 --> 01:53:03.283
Now, Ben, where is this other way out?

1450
01:53:03.366 --> 01:53:05.451
Well, that's it.
It doesn't make any sense,

1451
01:53:05.535 --> 01:53:07.745
because the first thing the builders
would have done

1452
01:53:07.829 --> 01:53:11.958
after getting down here was cut
a secondary shaft back out for air…

1453
01:53:12.041 --> 01:53:14.460
- Right.
- …in case of cave-ins.

1454
01:53:37.442 --> 01:53:39.736
Could it really be that simple?

1455
01:53:44.824 --> 01:53:47.243
"The secret lies with Charlotte."

1456
01:55:14.997 --> 01:55:17.917
Scrolls from the library at Alexandria.

1457
01:55:20.253 --> 01:55:22.171
Could this be possible?

1458
01:55:41.691 --> 01:55:45.528
It's a big bluish-green man,

1459
01:55:46.821 --> 01:55:49.907
with a strange-looking goatee.

1460
01:55:49.991 --> 01:55:52.368
I'm guessing that's significant.

1461
01:56:41.751 --> 01:56:42.793
Yes!

1462
01:56:54.764 --> 01:56:56.766
Riley, are you crying?

1463
01:56:57.475 --> 01:56:58.601
Look.

1464
01:56:59.644 --> 01:57:00.937
Stairs.

1465
01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:19.247
Hi.

1466
01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:22.457
Do you have a cell phone
I could borrow?

1467
01:57:35.471 --> 01:57:37.807
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1468
01:57:38.474 --> 01:57:41.560
You do know you just handed me
your biggest bargaining chip?

1469
01:57:41.644 --> 01:57:45.231
The Declaration of Independence
is not a bargaining chip.

1470
01:57:45.314 --> 01:57:47.066
Not to me.

1471
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:48.526
Have a seat.

1472
01:57:49.277 --> 01:57:50.820
So what's your offer?

1473
01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:54.198
How about a bribe?

1474
01:57:54.282 --> 01:57:57.451
Say $10 billion?

1475
01:57:59.662 --> 01:58:01.330
I take it you found the treasure?

1476
01:58:01.414 --> 01:58:04.250
It's about five stories
beneath your shoes.

1477
01:58:07.753 --> 01:58:10.006
You know, the Templars
and the Freemasons believed

1478
01:58:10.089 --> 01:58:13.217
that the treasure
was too great for any one man to have,

1479
01:58:13.301 --> 01:58:14.594
not even a king.

1480
01:58:14.677 --> 01:58:18.347
That's why they went to such lengths
to keep it hidden.

1481
01:58:18.431 --> 01:58:19.890
That's right.

1482
01:58:20.808 --> 01:58:24.603
The Founding Fathers believed
the same thing about government.

1483
01:58:24.687 --> 01:58:28.274
I figure their solution
will work for the treasure too.

1484
01:58:28.357 --> 01:58:29.358
Give it to the people.

1485
01:58:29.442 --> 01:58:33.529
Divide it amongst the Smithsonian,
the Louvre, the Cairo museum…

1486
01:58:34.864 --> 01:58:37.783
There's thousands of years
of world history down there.

1487
01:58:37.867 --> 01:58:41.037
And it belongs to the world,
and everybody in it.

1488
01:58:42.455 --> 01:58:46.626
You really don't understand
the concept of a bargaining chip.

1489
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:49.170
Okay, here's what I want.

1490
01:58:49.253 --> 01:58:51.630
Dr Chase gets off completely clean,

1491
01:58:51.714 --> 01:58:53.525
not even a little Post-it
on her service record.

1492
01:58:53.549 --> 01:58:54.592
Okay.

1493
01:58:54.675 --> 01:59:00.890
I want the credit for the find
to go to the entire Gates family,

1494
01:59:00.973 --> 01:59:03.809
with the assistance of Mr Riley Poole.

1495
01:59:03.893 --> 01:59:05.645
And what about you?

1496
01:59:06.228 --> 01:59:08.230
I'd really love not to go to prison.

1497
01:59:08.314 --> 01:59:10.650
I can't even begin to describe

1498
01:59:10.733 --> 01:59:13.569
how much
I would love not to go to prison.

1499
01:59:14.570 --> 01:59:17.073
Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.

1500
01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:21.660
Well, if you've got a helicopter,
I think I can help with that.

1501
01:59:31.170 --> 01:59:33.214
- Freeze! FBI!
- FBI!

1502
01:59:35.758 --> 01:59:39.637
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Show me your hands!

1503
01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:42.390
- Put your hands up.
- Move, move, move.

1504
01:59:46.936 --> 01:59:48.646
You're under arrest, Mr Howe.

1505
01:59:48.729 --> 01:59:52.108
We've got you on kidnapping,
attempted murder

1506
01:59:52.191 --> 01:59:54.902
and trespassing
on government property.

1507
02:00:03.577 --> 02:00:06.539
Yeah. You got it, Chief.
Thank you. Bye.

1508
02:00:07.665 --> 02:00:10.709
They want us in Cairo next week
for the opening of the exhibit.

1509
02:00:10.793 --> 02:00:12.545
They're sending a private jet.

1510
02:00:12.628 --> 02:00:14.922
- That's fun.
- Yeah, big whoop.

1511
02:00:15.005 --> 02:00:17.883
We could have had
a whole fleet of private jets.

1512
02:00:17.967 --> 02:00:19.301
Ten percent, Ben.

1513
02:00:19.385 --> 02:00:21.512
They offered you 10%
and you turned it down.

1514
02:00:21.595 --> 02:00:24.932
Riley, we've been over this.
It was too much. I couldn't accept it.

1515
02:00:25.015 --> 02:00:27.852
I still have this splinter
that's been festering for three months

1516
02:00:27.935 --> 02:00:30.122
- from an old piece of wood.
- Okay, I'll tell you what.

1517
02:00:30.146 --> 02:00:34.024
Next time we find a treasure
that redefines history for all mankind,

1518
02:00:34.108 --> 02:00:36.110
you make the call on the finder's fee.

1519
02:00:36.193 --> 02:00:37.987
That's not as funny.

1520
02:00:38.737 --> 02:00:41.532
What do you care? You got the girl.

1521
02:00:41.615 --> 02:00:43.534
- It's true.
- It's true.

1522
02:00:46.662 --> 02:00:49.123
Rub it in. Enjoy your spoils

1523
02:00:49.206 --> 02:00:51.000
while I sit on one percent.

1524
02:00:53.169 --> 02:00:56.130
One stinking percent.
Half of one percent, actually.

1525
02:00:56.213 --> 02:00:58.758
One percent. Unbelievable.

1526
02:00:58.841 --> 02:01:01.469
I'm sorry for your suffering, Riley.

1527
02:01:01.552 --> 02:01:04.889
For the record, Ben, I like the house.

1528
02:01:05.765 --> 02:01:09.059
You know, I chose this estate
because in 1812 Charles Carroll met…

1529
02:01:09.143 --> 02:01:11.604
Yeah, someone that did something
in history and had fun.

1530
02:01:11.687 --> 02:01:13.355
That's great. Wonderful.

1531
02:01:14.064 --> 02:01:16.609
Could have had a bigger house.

1532
02:01:24.533 --> 02:01:27.328
- I made something for you.
- You did? What?

1533
02:01:28.329 --> 02:01:29.997
- A map.
- A map?

1534
02:01:31.207 --> 02:01:33.083
Where does it lead to?

1535
02:01:33.793 --> 02:01:35.753
You'll figure it out.

1536
02:10:34.683 --> 02:10:36.684
English
