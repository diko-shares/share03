Well, I'm no expert, but...

110
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.090
It could be that the hydrothermic
properties of this region

111
00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.175
produce hurricane-force ice storms

112
00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:33.430

migrating land mass

114
00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:41.938

175
00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:59.565

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:10.243
is to make what was
undetectable detectable.

180
00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:14.956
Unless...
"The key in Silence" could be...

181
00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:16.249
Prison.

182
00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.002
Albuquerque.

183
00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:23.047
See, I can do it, too. Snorkel.

184
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.567
That's where the map is.
Like he said, "Fifty-five in iron pen."

185
00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:27.135
"Iron pen" is a prison.

186
00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:32.014
Or it could be, since the primary writing
medium of the time was iron gall ink,

187
00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:35.852
the "pen" is... Just a pen.

188
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:40.064
But then why not say a pen?
Why... Why say "iron pen"?

189
00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.359
'Cause it's a prison.

190
00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:44.569
Wait a minute. "Iron pen,"

191
00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:48.197
the "iron" does not describe
the ink in the pen,

192
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:51.075
it describes what was penned.

193
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:54.370
It was "iron,"
it was firm, it was mineral...

194
00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.122
No, no, no, that's stupid.

195
00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:57.915
It was...

196
00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:01.878
It was firm, it was adamant,
it was resolved.

197
00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:05.131
It was resolved.

198
00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:08.384
"Mr Matlack can't offend."

199
00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:12.346
Timothy Matlack was the official scribe
of the Continental Congress.

200
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.473
Calligrapher, not writer.

201
00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.309
And to make sure
he could not offend the map,

202
00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:20.354
it was put on the back of a resolution
that he transcribed,

203
00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:24.609
a resolution that 55 men signed.

204
00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:29.238
The Declaration of Independence.

205
00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:38.247
Come on, there's no invisible map

206
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:41.000
on the back
of the Declaration of Independence.

207
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.210
That's clever, really.

208
00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:45.671
A document of that importance
would ensure the map's survival.

209
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:48.674
And you said there were several
Masons signed it, yeah?

210
00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:52.011
Yeah. Nine, for sure.

211
00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:56.182
We'll have to arrange
a way to examine it.

212
00:16:56.933 --> 00:17:00.186
This is one of the most important
documents in history.

213
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:04.649
They're not just gonna let us waltz
in there and run chemical tests on it.

214
00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:07.902
- Then what do you propose we do?
- I don't know!

215
00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.657
We could borrow it.

216
00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:15.451
Steal it?

217
00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:19.997
- I don't think so.
- Ben...

218
00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:24.126
The treasure of the Knights Templar
is the treasure of all treasures.

219
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.462
I didn't know that. Really?

220
00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:29.507
Look, Ben...

221
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.301
I understand your bitterness.
I really do.

222
00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.530
You've spent your entire life
searching for this treasure,

223
00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.681
only to have the respected
historical community

224
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:40.059
treat you and your family
with mockery and contempt.

225
00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:43.521
You should be able to rub this treasure
in their arrogant faces,

226
00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:46.065
and I want you to have
the chance to do that.

227
00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.192
How?

228
00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:51.779
We all have our areas of expertise.

You don't think mine are limited
to writing cheques, do you?

In another life,

231
00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:03.332
I arranged a number of operations of

232
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.960
questionable legality.

233
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.339

So don't worry.
I'll make all the arrangements.

No.

236
00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:27.440
I'd really need your help here.

237

Ian, I'm not gonna let you steal
the Declaration of Independence.

238
00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:34.447

You know I can't bluff.

256
00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:39.470
if Shaw can catch.

is a notation that reads,

there's this invisible map?

00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:42.184
It's not.

351
00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:47.106
I was thinking, what if we go public,
plaster the story all over the Internet?

352
00:26:47.189 --> 00:26:51.443
It's not like
we have our reputations to worry about.

353
00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:55.572
Although I don't think
that's exactly gonna scare Ian away.

354
00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:59.701
180 years of searching,
and I'm three feet away.

355
00:27:00.744 --> 00:27:03.372
Of all the words written here
about freedom,

356
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:06.500
there's a line
that's at the heart of all the others.

357
00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:10.254
"But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations,

358
00:27:10.337 --> 00:27:12.881
"pursuing invariably the same Object,

to throw off such government

361
00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:24.601
"and provide new Guards

362
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:28.772
People don't talk that way anymore.

363
00:27:28.856 --> 00:27:30.399
Beautiful.

364
00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:35.237
- No idea what you said.
- It means, if there's something wrong,

365
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.030
those who have the ability
to take action

366
00:27:37.114 --> 00:27:39.867
have the responsibility to take action.

367
00:27:44.788 --> 00:27:46.540
I'm gonna steal it.

(SCOFFS)

369
00:27:50.085 --> 00:27:51.712
What?

370
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.590
I'm gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

Ben?

373
00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:05.434
RILEY: This is huge.

374
00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:08.854
It's prison huge.

375
00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:11.023
You are gonna go to prison,
you know that?

376
00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:12.608
Yeah, probably.

377
00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:16.236
So that would bother most people.

378
00:28:16.778 --> 00:28:18.405
Ian's gonna try and steal it.

379
00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:21.575
And if he succeeds,
he'll destroy the Declaration.

380
00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:25.204
The fact is, the only way to protect
the Declaration is to steal it.

381
00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:26.955
It's upside down.

382
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:31.376
I don't think there's a choice.

383
00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:34.671
Ben, for God's sakes,

384
00:28:34.755 --> 00:28:38.717
it's like stealing a national monument.
Okay?

385
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.302
It's like stealing him.

386
00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:45.432
It can't be done. Not shouldn't be done.
It can't be done.

387
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.977
Let me prove it to you.

388
00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:51.980
RILEY: Okay, Ben, pay attention.

389
00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:54.900
I've brought you to the
Library of Congress.

390
00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:58.654
Why? Because it's the biggest library
in the world.

391
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.822
Over 20 million books.

392
00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:03.617
And they're all saying
the same exact thing.

393
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.869
Listen to Riley.

394
00:29:05.953 --> 00:29:11.041
What we have here, my friend,
is an entire layout of the archives.

395
00:29:11.124 --> 00:29:13.293
Short of builders' blueprints.

396
00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:18.090
You've got construction orders,
phone lines,

397
00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:21.343
water and sewage, it's all here.

398
00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:24.471
Now, when the Declaration
is on display, okay,

399
00:29:24.554 --> 00:29:27.933
it is surrounded by guards
and video monitors

400
00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:29.768
<i>and little families from Iowa</i>

401
00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:32.020
<i>and little kids
on their eighth-grade field trip.</i>

402
00:29:32.104 --> 00:29:34.356
<i>And beneath an inch
of bulletproof glass</i>

403
00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:36.858
<i>is an army of sensors
and heat monitors</i>

404
00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:40.988
<i>that will go off if someone
gets too close with a high fever.</i>

405
00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:44.408
Now, when it's not on display,

406
00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:51.415
<i>it is lowered into a four-foot-thick
concrete, steel-plated vault...</i>

407
00:29:52.582 --> 00:29:56.920
That happens to be equipped
with an electronic combination lock

408
00:29:57.004 --> 00:29:59.256
and biometric access-denial systems.

409
00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:03.093
You know, Thomas Edison tried
and failed nearly 2,000 times

410
00:30:03.176 --> 00:30:05.595
to develop the carbonized
cotton-thread filament

411
00:30:05.679 --> 00:30:08.307
- for the incandescent light bulb.
- Edison?

412
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:09.641
When asked about it, he said,

413
00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:13.437
"I didn't fail, I found out 2,000 ways
how not to make a light bulb."

414
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.732
But he only needed to find one way
to make it work.

415
00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:22.612
The Preservation Room.
Enjoy. Go ahead.

416
00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:26.825
Do you know
what the Preservation Room is for?

417
00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:28.994
Delicious jams and jellies?

418
00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:32.331
No. That's where they clean,
repair and maintain

419
00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:34.333
all the documents
and the storage housings

420
00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:36.501
when they're not on display
or in the vault.

421
00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:39.463
Now, when the case needs work
they take it out of the vault,

422
00:30:39.546 --> 00:30:42.674
<i>directly across the hall
and into the Preservation Room.</i>

423
00:30:42.758 --> 00:30:46.887
<i>The best time for us, or Ian, to steal it
would be during the gala this weekend</i>

424
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.890
<i>when the guards are distracted
by the VIPs upstairs.</i>

425
00:30:49.973 --> 00:30:52.601
<i>But we'll make our way
to the Preservation Room,</i>

426
00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:55.729
where there's much less security.

427
00:30:57.189 --> 00:30:58.231
Huh.

428
00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:02.486

00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:14.790

but you do realise
how many people we have after us.

We probably have
our own satellite by now.

to decide to steal
the Declaration of Independence.

Yeah, but I didn't think I was gonna
personally have to tell my dad about it.

Because it's important?

754
00:57:06.924 --> 00:57:08.759
Because it's a name.

01:38:22.090 --> 01:38:23.550
Beneath the church.

1368
01:38:28.346 --> 01:38:30.849
- I'm so sorry, Ben.
- None of this is your fault.

1369
01:38:30.932 --> 01:38:32.716
- I could...
- Come on.

1370
01:38:41.693 --> 01:38:42.819
Look.

1371
01:38:44.653 --> 01:38:48.615
Cooperation only lasts as long
as the status quo is unchanged.

1372
01:38:48.699 --> 01:38:52.035
As soon as this guy
gets to wherever this thing ends,

1373
01:38:52.119 --> 01:38:54.955
he won't need you anymore
or any of us.

1374
01:38:55.038 --> 01:38:58.834
So we find a way to make sure
the status quo changes in our favour.

1375
01:38:58.917 --> 01:39:00.002
How?

1376
01:39:01.295 --> 01:39:03.088
I'm still working on it.

1377
01:39:03.172 --> 01:39:06.008
Well, I guess I better
work on it too, then.

1378
01:39:06.091 --> 01:39:08.802
Hey! Par... Hey, I found it!

1379
01:39:08.886 --> 01:39:10.220
- Him!
- Ben!

1380
01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:12.556
It's a name.

1381
01:39:16.185 --> 01:39:17.895
Parkington Lane.

1382
01:39:17.978 --> 01:39:21.607
He was a third-degree master mason
of the Blue...

1383
01:39:21.690 --> 01:39:23.192
Hey! Stop!

1384
01:39:38.081 --> 01:39:39.166
Easy.

1385
01:39:40.751 --> 01:39:42.085
ALL: Whoa!

1386
01:39:43.337 --> 01:39:45.172
Careful no one steps in him.

1387
01:39:45.255 --> 01:39:47.216
All right, put it down.

1388
01:39:54.597 --> 01:39:59.143
Okay. Who wants to go down
the creepy tunnel inside the tomb first?

1389
01:40:00.728 --> 01:40:02.063
IAN: Right.

1390
01:40:02.146 --> 01:40:05.149
McGregor, Viktor, you stay here.

1391
01:40:05.233 --> 01:40:08.486
And if anyone
should come out without me,

1392
01:40:08.569 --> 01:40:10.863
well, use your imagination.

1393
01:40:13.866 --> 01:40:15.284
Shall we?

1394
01:40:33.636 --> 01:40:35.304
You got a light?

1395
01:40:53.155 --> 01:40:54.407
BEN: Careful.

1396
01:40:55.324 --> 01:40:57.034
Watch your step.

1397
01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:05.000
Come here.

1398
01:41:14.843 --> 01:41:17.262
Why does that never happen to me?

1399
01:41:23.268 --> 01:41:24.769
IAN: What's this?

1400
01:41:40.827 --> 01:41:42.495
BEN: It's a chandelier.

1401
01:41:52.213 --> 01:41:53.423
Here.

1402
01:42:09.355 --> 01:42:11.482
RILEY: Wow.
BEN: Look at the elevators.

1403
01:42:12.232 --> 01:42:13.484
PATRICK: A dumbwaiter system.

1404
01:42:13.567 --> 01:42:16.403
How do a bunch of guys
with hand tools build all this?

1405
01:42:16.487 --> 01:42:20.366
Same way they built the pyramids
and the Great Wall of China.

1406
01:42:20.449 --> 01:42:23.369
Yeah. The aliens helped them.

1407
01:42:23.452 --> 01:42:25.829
Right, let's go.
What are we waiting for?

1408
01:42:25.913 --> 01:42:30.250
I'm not going out on that thing.
200 years of termite damage and rot.

1409
01:42:30.334 --> 01:42:32.378
Dad, do what he says.

1410
01:42:52.481 --> 01:42:54.274
PATRICK: Watch your step.

1411
01:42:56.735 --> 01:42:58.487
We're right under the Trinity graveyard.

1412
01:42:58.570 --> 01:43:01.782
That's probably why
no one ever found this.

1413
01:43:02.324 --> 01:43:03.951
(RUMBLING)

1414
01:43:05.953 --> 01:43:07.496
What is that?

1415
01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:13.751
Subway.

1416
01:43:19.799 --> 01:43:22.260
IAN: No! Shaw! Oh, God, Shaw!

1417
01:43:25.346 --> 01:43:26.764
(YELLS)

1418
01:43:33.354 --> 01:43:34.772
ABIGAIL: Oh, my God.

1419
01:43:39.736 --> 01:43:41.487
ABIGAIL: Hold on! Hold on!

1420
01:43:44.699 --> 01:43:47.034
Okay, get on the elevator. Jump!

1421
01:43:50.329 --> 01:43:52.457
ABIGAIL: Ben! Grab my hand.

1422
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:56.544
- Come on.
- PATRICK: Ian!

1423
01:43:56.627 --> 01:43:58.296
BEN: Abigail! Get on!

1424
01:44:02.842 --> 01:44:03.968
Jump!

1425
01:44:14.353 --> 01:44:15.480
Here.

1426
01:44:15.855 --> 01:44:18.064
(SCREAMING)

1427
01:44:23.862 --> 01:44:24.946
ABIGAIL: Ben!

1428
01:44:25.989 --> 01:44:28.450
Get down there. Get down there!

1429
01:44:33.872 --> 01:44:35.499
The Declaration.

1430
01:44:38.919 --> 01:44:40.962
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

1431
01:44:55.227 --> 01:44:56.728
Oh, no! Ben!

1432
01:45:03.401 --> 01:45:04.820
Hang on!

1433
01:45:13.745 --> 01:45:14.830
PATRICK: Son!

1434
01:45:22.879 --> 01:45:26.549
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I dropped you.
I had to save the Declaration.

1435
01:45:26.632 --> 01:45:30.469
No, don't be. I would have done
exactly the same thing to you.

1436
01:45:31.387 --> 01:45:32.680
Really?

1437
01:45:33.514 --> 01:45:36.141
I would have dropped you both.

1438
01:45:36.225 --> 01:45:37.518
Freaks.

1439
01:45:44.692 --> 01:45:45.943
Get on.

1440
01:45:47.069 --> 01:45:48.279
Ian,

1441
01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:51.282
it's not worth it.

1442
01:45:51.365 --> 01:45:56.287
Do you imagine any one of your lives
is more valuable to me than Shaw's?

1443
01:45:56.370 --> 01:45:57.621
We go on.

1444
01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:00.875
The status quo.

1445
01:46:01.917 --> 01:46:03.669
Keep the status quo.

1446
01:46:10.968 --> 01:46:12.803
RILEY: Now what?
PATRICK: This is...

1447
01:46:14.263 --> 01:46:16.348
This is where it all leads.

1448
01:46:26.567 --> 01:46:28.110
Okay, let's go.

1449
01:47:11.527 --> 01:47:13.029
What is this?

1450
01:47:14.155 --> 01:47:16.115
So where's the treasure?

1451
01:47:19.452 --> 01:47:20.536
Well?

1452
01:47:22.538 --> 01:47:23.873
RILEY: This is it?

1453
01:47:24.874 --> 01:47:27.377
We came all this way for a dead end?

1454
01:47:28.503 --> 01:47:29.712
Yes.

1455
01:47:30.463 --> 01:47:32.006
(LAUGHS)

1456
01:47:33.216 --> 01:47:34.360
RILEY:
There's gotta be something more.

1457
01:47:34.384 --> 01:47:35.969
BEN: Riley, there's nothing more.

1458
01:47:36.052 --> 01:47:38.470
- Another clue...
- No, there are no more clues!

1459
01:47:38.553 --> 01:47:40.347
That's it, okay? It's over!

1460
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:44.643
End of the road. The treasure's gone.
Moved. Taken somewhere else.

1461
01:47:45.644 --> 01:47:48.730
You're not playing games with me,
are you, Ben?

1462
01:47:49.731 --> 01:47:51.525
You know where it is.

1463
01:47:52.818 --> 01:47:53.860
No.

1464
01:47:58.156 --> 01:47:59.449
Okay, go.

1465
01:48:00.575 --> 01:48:02.369
Hey, wait a minute.

1466
01:48:03.745 --> 01:48:06.039
RILEY: Hey! Ian, wait!
PATRICK: Wait, wait, wait!

1467
01:48:06.123 --> 01:48:07.843
ABIGAIL: Ian...
RILEY: We'll be trapped.

1468
01:48:07.916 --> 01:48:10.335
- BEN: Don't do this.
- You can't just leave us here.

1469
01:48:10.419 --> 01:48:14.339
Yes, I can.
Unless Ben tells me the next clue.

1470
01:48:14.423 --> 01:48:16.717
There isn't another clue.

1471
01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.594
Ian, listen, why don't you
come back down here

1472
01:48:19.678 --> 01:48:21.263
and we can talk through this together?

1473
01:48:21.346 --> 01:48:23.432
- Don't speak again.
- Okay.

1474
01:48:25.392 --> 01:48:28.478
The clue. Where's the treasure?

1475
01:48:30.564 --> 01:48:31.773
Ben?

1476
01:48:33.608 --> 01:48:34.609
(GUN COCKS)

1477
01:48:34.693 --> 01:48:36.611
- The lantern.
- Dad...

1478
01:48:38.613 --> 01:48:40.657
The status quo has changed, son.

1479
01:48:40.741 --> 01:48:41.950
Don't.

1480
01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:47.496
It's part of Freemason teachings.

1481
01:48:49.457 --> 01:48:52.543
In King Solomon's temple
there was a winding staircase.

1482
01:48:52.626 --> 01:48:57.214
It signified the journey that had to be
made to find the light of truth.

1483
01:48:58.758 --> 01:49:01.927
- The lantern is the clue.
- IAN: And what does it mean?

1484
01:49:02.636 --> 01:49:04.930
Boston. It's Boston.

1485
01:49:05.014 --> 01:49:06.766
The Old North Church in Boston,

1486
01:49:06.849 --> 01:49:10.561
where Thomas Newton
hung a lantern in the steeple,

1487
01:49:10.644 --> 01:49:13.064
to signal Paul Revere
that the British were coming.

1488
01:49:13.147 --> 01:49:15.816
"One if by land, two if by sea."
One lantern.

1489
01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.902
Under the winding staircase
of the steeple,

1490
01:49:17.985 --> 01:49:19.737
that's where we have to look.

1491
01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:23.365
- Thank you.
- Hey, you have to take us with you.

1492
01:49:23.449 --> 01:49:26.452
Why? So you can escape in Boston?

1493
01:49:26.535 --> 01:49:30.081
Besides, with you out of the picture
there's less baggage to carry.

1494
01:49:30.164 --> 01:49:31.999
What if we lied?

1495
01:49:32.625 --> 01:49:33.626
Did you?

1496
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:36.003
What if there's another clue?

1497
01:49:36.796 --> 01:49:39.590
Then I'll know right where to find you.

1498
01:49:40.508 --> 01:49:42.009
See you, Ben.

1499
01:49:45.137 --> 01:49:46.931
- No!
- RILEY: There's no other way out!

1500
01:49:47.014 --> 01:49:49.850
- ABIGAIL: Come back!
- You're gonna need us, Ian!

1501
01:49:49.975 --> 01:49:51.727
We're all gonna die.

1502
01:49:52.519 --> 01:49:56.272
It's gonna be okay, Riley.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1503
01:49:56.356 --> 01:49:58.691
PATRICK: It's okay, kiddo.

1504
01:49:58.775 --> 01:50:00.610
ABIGAIL: Okay, boys, what's going on?

1505
01:50:00.693 --> 01:50:04.322
The British came by sea.
It was two lanterns, not one.

1506
01:50:04.405 --> 01:50:07.617
Ian needed another clue,
so we gave it to him.

1507
01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:10.370
It was a fake. It was a fake clue.

1508
01:50:11.037 --> 01:50:12.747
The all-seeing eye.

1509
01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:15.792
"Through the all-seeing eye."

1510
01:50:16.584 --> 01:50:19.629
That means by the time Ian
figures it out and comes back here,

1511
01:50:19.712 --> 01:50:23.049
we'll still be trapped,
and he'll shoot us then.

1512
01:50:23.967 --> 01:50:26.094
Either way we're gonna die.

1513
01:50:27.428 --> 01:50:30.557
Nobody's gonna die.
There's another way out.

1514
01:50:31.307 --> 01:50:32.559
Where?

1515
01:50:32.642 --> 01:50:34.394
Through the treasure room.

1516
01:50:41.901 --> 01:50:42.986
Here.

1517
01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:54.747
Riley.

1518
01:51:21.982 --> 01:51:25.027
Looks like someone got here first.

1519
01:51:26.695 --> 01:51:28.238
I'm sorry, Ben.

1520
01:51:29.281 --> 01:51:30.616
It's gone.

1521
01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:35.204
Listen, Ben...

1522
01:51:35.287 --> 01:51:36.413
It may have even been gone

1523
01:51:36.496 --> 01:51:39.958
before Charles Carroll
told the story to Thomas Gates.

1524
01:51:41.543 --> 01:51:43.212
It doesn't matter.

1525
01:51:43.754 --> 01:51:45.839
I know. 'Cause you were right.

1526
01:51:46.798 --> 01:51:48.508
PATRICK: No, I wasn't right.

1527
01:51:49.718 --> 01:51:51.678
This room is real, Ben.

1528
01:51:52.471 --> 01:51:55.224
And that means the treasure is real.

1529
01:51:55.307 --> 01:51:57.911
We're in the company of some
of the most brilliant minds in history,

1530
01:51:57.935 --> 01:52:02.105
because you found
what they left behind for us to find

1531
01:52:02.189 --> 01:52:04.691
and understood the meaning of it.

1532
01:52:04.775 --> 01:52:07.193
You did it, Ben. For all of us.

1533
01:52:08.694 --> 01:52:11.656
Your grandfather, and all of us.

1534
01:52:12.490 --> 01:52:15.660
And I've never been so happy
to be proven wrong.

1535
01:52:26.837 --> 01:52:28.130
I just

1536
01:52:29.131 --> 01:52:32.051
really thought
I was gonna find the treasure.

1537
01:52:34.178 --> 01:52:35.304
Okay.

1538
01:52:36.097 --> 01:52:38.516
Then we just keep looking for it.

1539
01:52:42.228 --> 01:52:43.437
I'm in.

1540
01:52:48.943 --> 01:52:50.069
Okay.

1541
01:52:52.363 --> 01:52:55.616
Not to be Johnny Rain Cloud here,
but that's not gonna happen.

1542
01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:59.078
Because as far as I can see,
we're still trapped down here.

1543
01:52:59.161 --> 01:53:00.830
- ABIGAIL: Yeah.
- Hell.

1544
01:53:01.497 --> 01:53:03.291
RILEY: Now, Ben,
where is this other way out?

1545
01:53:03.374 --> 01:53:05.459
BEN: Well, that's it.
It doesn't make any sense,

1546
01:53:05.543 --> 01:53:07.753
because the first thing the builders
would have done

1547
01:53:07.837 --> 01:53:11.966
after getting down here was cut
a secondary shaft back out for air...

1548
01:53:12.049 --> 01:53:14.467
- Right.
- ...in case of cave-ins.

1549
01:53:37.449 --> 01:53:39.743
Could it really be that simple?

1550
01:53:44.831 --> 01:53:47.250
"The secret lies with Charlotte."

1553
01:55:20.259 --> 01:55:22.177
Could this be possible?

(GASPS)

1555
01:55:41.696 --> 01:55:45.533
It's a big bluish-green man,

1556
01:55:46.826 --> 01:55:49.912
with a strange-looking goatee.

1557
01:55:49.996 --> 01:55:52.373
I'm guessing that's significant.

1558
01:56:41.755 --> 01:56:42.797
Yes!

1559
01:56:54.768 --> 01:56:56.770
Riley, are you crying?

1560
01:56:57.479 --> 01:56:58.605
Look.

1561
01:56:59.648 --> 01:57:00.941
Stairs.

(COUGHS)

1564
01:57:18.124 --> 01:57:19.251
Hi.

1565
01:57:20.335 --> 01:57:22.462
Do you have a cell phone
I could borrow?

1566
01:57:35.475 --> 01:57:37.811
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1567
01:57:38.478 --> 01:57:41.564
You do know you just handed me
your biggest bargaining chip?

1568
01:57:41.647 --> 01:57:45.234
The Declaration of Independence
is not a bargaining chip.

1569
01:57:45.317 --> 01:57:47.027
Not to me.

1570
01:57:47.111 --> 01:57:48.487
Have a seat.

1571
01:57:49.238 --> 01:57:50.823
So what's your offer?

1572
01:57:52.241 --> 01:57:54.159
How about a bribe?

1573
01:57:54.243 --> 01:57:57.413
Say $10 billion?

1574
01:57:59.665 --> 01:58:01.292
I take it you found the treasure?

1575
01:58:01.375 --> 01:58:04.211
It's about five storeys
beneath your shoes.

1576
01:58:07.715 --> 01:58:09.967
You know, the Templars
and the Freemasons believed

1577
01:58:10.050 --> 01:58:13.178
that the treasure
was too great for any one man to have,

1578
01:58:13.262 --> 01:58:14.597
not even a king.

1579
01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:18.309
That's why they went to such lengths
to keep it hidden.

1580
01:58:18.392 --> 01:58:19.852
That's right.

1581
01:58:20.769 --> 01:58:24.565
The Founding Fathers believed
the same thing about government.

1582
01:58:24.648 --> 01:58:28.235
I figure their solution
will work for the treasure too.

1583
01:58:28.319 --> 01:58:29.320
Give it to the people.

1584
01:58:29.403 --> 01:58:33.490
Divide it amongst the Smithsonian,
the Louvre, the Cairo museum...

1585
01:58:34.825 --> 01:58:37.786
There's thousands of years
of world history down there.

1586
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:41.040
And it belongs to the world,
and everybody in it.

1587
01:58:42.416 --> 01:58:46.587
You really don't understand
the concept of a bargaining chip.

1588
01:58:46.670 --> 01:58:49.130
Okay, here's what I want.

1589
01:58:49.213 --> 01:58:51.591
Dr Chase gets off completely clean,

1590
01:58:51.716 --> 01:58:53.527
not even a little Post-it
on her service record.

I'd really love not to go to prison.

I would love not to go to prison.

I think I can help with that.

We've got you on kidnapping,
attempted murder

1606

and trespassing
on government property.

02:00:03.537 --> 02:00:06.498
Yeah. You got it, Chief.
Thank you. Bye.

1608

They want us in Cairo next week
for the opening of the exhibit.

1609
02:00:10.752 --> 02:00:12.546
They're sending a private jet.

1610
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:14.881
- That's fun.
- Yeah, big whoop.

1611
02:00:14.965 --> 02:00:17.884
We could have had
a whole fleet of private jets.

1612
02:00:17.968 --> 02:00:19.261
Ten percent, Ben.

1613
02:00:19.344 --> 02:00:21.471
They offered you 10%
and you turned it down.

1614
02:00:21.555 --> 02:00:24.891
Riley, we've been over this.
It was too much. I couldn't accept it.

1615
02:00:24.975 --> 02:00:27.811
I still have this splinter
that's been festering for three months

1616
02:00:27.894 --> 02:00:30.081
- from an old piece of wood.
- Okay, I'll tell you what.

that redefines history for all mankind,
