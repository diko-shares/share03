1
00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:39.284
<i>Yes, yes. How's it looking?</i>

2
00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:41.411
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.831
It is here, bruv.

4
00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:46.416
This is insane.

5
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.045
I can't believe
this is actually happening. Yes.

6
00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:52.047
<i>-What's it saying?
</i>-Oh, bruv, it's beautiful.

7
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.424
<i>Dude, how many months
of selling underwear did you have to do</i>

8
00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:56.385
<i>to afford the new wheel? Be honest.</i>

9
00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:59.346
<i>I just know this means
you'll be at the gaming cafe less.</i>

10
00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.182
Yeah, bruv, I'm bored of the cafe.

11
00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:05.352
Yo, I'm 99% sure
that I've beaten every single person

12
00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.604
that's ever stepped foot in the cafe.

13
00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:10.732
Also, for your information,

14
00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.652
it only took me a month
of saving up at the knickers store

15
00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:14.862
to afford the new wheel.

16
00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:18.073
Not months, plural. Month, singular.

17
00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.741
Moment of truth.

18
00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:21.285
Oh, she's perfect.

19
00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:25.414
This is so much better than my old setup.

20
00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:28.292
I'm sorry, I'm unstoppable now.
I'm unstoppable.

21
00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.044
<i>All right, Big Dog.
I'm looking at Rory right now</i>

22
00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:32.880
<i>and he says to meet in the lobby.</i>

23
00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:34.381
<i>Race Le Mans. Yeah?</i>

24
00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:36.842
Fine. I'll play Rory.

25
00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.677
-Jann.
-But tell him to bring his own coffin.

26
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.595
Jann.

27
00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:41.597
Hey. Sorry, Dad.

28
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.973
We're headed to the field.

29
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.267
You wanna get outside
and kick it around a bit?

30
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.311
Get some air? It'll do you good.

31
00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:50.689
No, I'm okay.

32
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.817
Sooner or later you're gonna have
to leave this room, right?

33
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.820
Dad! Come on, let's go!

34
00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.282
You could learn from your younger brother.

35
00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.993
If you'd practice football half as much
as you play this damn game--

36
00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:06.330
I don't like football, Dad.
We've been over this.

37
00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.085
'Sup, man, you still there?

38
00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:13.837
<i>Yeah.</i>

39
00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:16.964
<i>Jeez, your dad's not into your lifestyle,
my bro.</i>

40
00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:19.510
God, yeah, no shit.

41
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.599
Bruv, I'm just gonna do
a quick custom job.

42
00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:28.936
<i>Where'd you go?</i>

43
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.812
<i>Janny.</i>

44
00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:37.653
<i>Janny, where'd you go?</i>

45
00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:40.948
{\an8}Sorry, I'm just adjusting the rear wing.

46
00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:44.326
Giving it more downforce. More rake.

47
00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.161
<i>Janny, Rory's waiting.</i>

48
00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:48.789
Sorry, this car is ridiculous.

49
00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:51.959
At this point this is actually a waste
of my time, but you know what?

50
00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.670
Go on, I'll play Rory. Why not?

51
00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:58.215
<i>-The anticipation is killing me, bruv.
</i>-I'm loading him into the Le Mans race.

52
00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.132
Okay.

53
00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:03.053
-Ready.
<i>-Go, Speed Racer.</i>

54
00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:06.014
Let's go.

55
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.594
Hi. Good to see you again.

56
00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.233
{\an8}<i>How may I help you, sir?</i>

57
00:05:58.317 --> 00:06:02.654
{\an8}I'm Danny Moore with Marketing.
I have a meeting with Motorsports.

58
00:06:02.738 --> 00:06:06.742
-Yes. Perfect. Here is your pass, sir.
-Thank you so much.

59
00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:14.541
Well, thank you again for having me.

60
00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.630
This is Yamauchi Kazunori,

61
00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.216
creator of <i>Gran Turismo,</i>

62
00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:25.302
a racing game so accurate...

63
00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:31.266
it's inspired a love of driving
in 80 million players.

64
00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:35.646
The realism, the physics,

65
00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.481
the fidelity of the cars.

66
00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:40.692
And recreated
the world's most famous racetracks

67
00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:42.778
with meticulous attention to detail.

68
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.573
They test these cars over and over again.

69
00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:48.575
All of this comes together

70
00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:52.037
to give the player
the most realistic driving experience.

71
00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:55.457
So when I came to Nissan...

72
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.085
my job was...

73
00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:01.922
to call people who defaulted
on their car payments.

74
00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:07.052
Most of them said,
"Go ahead, take it. I don't want it."

75
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.514
They'd rather be on their phones
in the back of an Uber

76
00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.015
than driving themselves.

77
00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:16.311
Car buyers today don't dream
of the open road.

78
00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:19.606
They don't associate their cars
with adventure.

79
00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:22.901
But <i>Gran Turismo</i> players do.

80
00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:28.073
This is an untapped demographic of buyers

81
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:30.826
that we should be reaching.

82
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.997
And how do you suggest we do that?

83
00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:37.291
By creating a contest

84
00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:41.753
that offers the best video game players
in the world a chance

85
00:07:41.837 --> 00:07:44.256
to compete in professional racing.

86
00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:47.301
If we can take one driver

87
00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:50.137
from the virtual world,
from behind their console,

88
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.309
and put them into a race car, onto a track
and turn them into a champion...

89
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:02.024
Nissan will reignite the dream to drive

90
00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:05.194
in 80 million others.

91
00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:13.994
Thank you.

92
00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:22.961
Mr. Moore.

93
00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:26.089
You left these upstairs.

94
00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:32.888
You really believe
one of these players could compete.

95
00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:37.433
I do. Absolutely, yeah.

96
00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:41.938
I've played the game
and it's remarkable, actually.

97
00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:46.818
You understand if we put them in our cars
and somebody was hurt,

98
00:08:46.902 --> 00:08:48.779
we would all be responsible.

99
00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.490
Yes, I understand. Yes. Yeah.

100
00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:56.036
The board has agreed to move forward
with your program under one condition.

101
00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:59.289
You find a certified chief engineer
to ensure that it's safe.

102
00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:01.500
There can be no mistakes.

103
00:09:02.793 --> 00:09:05.295
Absolutely. Of course.

104
00:09:05.921 --> 00:09:06.922
I wish you luck.

105
00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:09.716
Thank you.

106
00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:13.762
Holy shit.

107
00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:18.725
<i>Yeah, of course I understand.
It is. It's a very steep learning curve.</i>

108
00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:21.436
But with the right instructor,
you know, like you...

109
00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:25.107
Yeah.

110
00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:26.733
Yeah, I do.

111
00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.738
Thank you again for your time.

112
00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:48.797
Holy shit.

113
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.425
Jack Salter.

114
00:10:38.764 --> 00:10:39.765
Jack.

115
00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:42.267
Jack!

116
00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:46.855
Salter!

117
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.111
Got a visitor. Make it quick.

118
00:10:53.195 --> 00:10:55.113
Capa wants that fixed yesterday.

119
00:11:04.623 --> 00:11:05.958
It's a contest.

120
00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:10.462
The fastest SIM racers in the world...

121
00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:13.257
get to compete in a camp.

122
00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:16.635
And the winner gets to race
for Team Nissan.

123
00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:23.100
Wow. What do you get out of this?
You get a bigger office or something?

124
00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.351
I wish.

125
00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.396
It's insane. It's not gonna work.
It's far too dangerous.

126
00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:28.313
Why?

127
00:11:28.814 --> 00:11:31.191
You really think
that you're gonna put some kid

128
00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:33.902
who's been playing a game in his bedroom

129
00:11:33.986 --> 00:11:36.780
into a 200-mile-an-hour rocket?

130
00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:38.740
It'll tear him to pieces.

131
00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.910
These players have clocked more track time

132
00:11:41.994 --> 00:11:44.538
than you have in your entire career.

133
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:47.124
On, what do you call it, a console?

134
00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:51.503
You know that if you get in a wreck
out here, you can't hit reset, right?

135
00:11:51.587 --> 00:11:54.047
How many guys you go to
before you went to me?

136
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:56.049
-A few.
-Yeah. "A few."

137
00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:57.593
A lot.

138
00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:01.305
But nobody
with your particular experience.

139
00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:04.016
Oh, God. Come on, man.

140
00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:07.102
I haven't been chief engineer in 15 years.

141
00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:12.691
These kids, they're outsiders too.

142
00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:17.154
I know it's unprecedented,
but so was a kid from Iowa racing Le Mans.

143
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.657
Yeah. Look how that turned out.

144
00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:25.412
Don't you wanna take racing back
from these pricks

145
00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.039
who think they can just buy it?

146
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:32.669
I'm talking about a chance
to compete again.

147
00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:34.838
Don't you want one last shot?

148
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.927
I think
those days are in my rearview, friend.

149
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.887
Then what are you doing here?

150
00:12:42.471 --> 00:12:44.640
Somewhere out there, there's a kid

151
00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:48.101
who's faster than all these assholes...

152
00:12:49.311 --> 00:12:52.981
that's just never gotten a chance
to show the world what they're capable of.

153
00:12:53.065 --> 00:12:54.983
I'm gonna find them!

154
00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:56.318
Yeah, cool.

155
00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:21.844
Here we go.

156
00:13:21.927 --> 00:13:23.762
Oh, yum, get excited.

157
00:13:23.846 --> 00:13:26.557
Lentil salad. My favorite.

158
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.227
-No sarcasm at the table, please.
-No having fun at the table, please.

159
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.689
You're a dedicated athlete.
Diet matters. Yeah? Eat up.

160
00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:36.191
You're starting on the wing tomorrow.
Plenty of eyes on you.

161
00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:40.737
Sorry. I'm sorry.

162
00:13:42.698 --> 00:13:45.742
When I go pro,
I'll eat at a steakhouse every night.

163
00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:47.452
You'll be there too, Jann.

164
00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.538
You could be our waiter.

165
00:13:50.122 --> 00:13:51.123
Very funny.

166
00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:54.042
But I'm not gonna be a waiter.
I've got plans.

167
00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:57.296
Says the dude who sells stockings
at the department store.

168
00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:58.881
-Coby.
-Coby, that's enough.

169
00:13:58.964 --> 00:14:00.799
-On a roll tonight.
-Okay.

170
00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:04.011
Have you thought at all
about going back to university?

171
00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:06.430
Mum, we've been over this so many times.

172
00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:09.349
Motorsports Engineering is a step
in that direction.

173
00:14:09.433 --> 00:14:12.561
And I told you, at university,
they didn't let us drive the cars.

174
00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.272
Not again about the race cars.

175
00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:18.150
Didn't you say
"Always do something you love"?

176
00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:24.323
Yes. Yes. I did,
but I meant within the realm of reality.

177
00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:27.784
I played grassroots football for years
before my first professional contract.

178
00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:31.914
Well, I can start at the bottom.
Work in the pits. Do car maintenance.

179
00:14:31.997 --> 00:14:34.124
Yeah, but that's not our world, son.

180
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:38.462
-You know what racing cars cost?
-It's what I love.

181
00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:41.173
It's what I'm good at.

182
00:14:45.177 --> 00:14:47.888
These lentils are quite nice.

183
00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:50.807
I'm not hungry.

184
00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:12.454
Throughout my life,
I've invested in talent

185
00:15:12.538 --> 00:15:14.915
that guarantees me
a front-row seat to greatness,

186
00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:17.709
and this is what we endeavor towards
this season.

187
00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:20.295
To be elite.

188
00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:26.385
No? Nicky, my boy,
last year we had a rough start.

189
00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:27.803
But this year,

190
00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:32.099
everything from the cars to the team
will be best in class.

191
00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:34.393
This year will be our greatest.

192
00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:35.519
Hear, hear.

193
00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:39.690
This season is going to be great,
but it comes down to dedication.

194
00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:41.441
Talent.

195
00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:46.989
So no messing around. I'll demand
as much from you as I do of myself,

196
00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:49.241
so make sure you keep up or you're gone.

197
00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:52.160
Nick, you looked good out there today.

198
00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.039
You have something to say?

199
00:15:56.123 --> 00:16:00.252
You're not carrying enough speed
into turn four.

200
00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:04.923
You know that, right? You're braking early
and you should push it.

201
00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:07.676
Oh, you're giving me advice right now?

202
00:16:13.432 --> 00:16:15.225
You're a good driver, Nick.

203
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:17.769
I don't know how many times
you need to hear that.

204
00:16:17.853 --> 00:16:21.148
But you get a little emotional.
And when you get emotional--

205
00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:27.321
You're a mechanic.

206
00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:31.617
If I want driving advice,
I'll talk to my team leader.

207
00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:35.245
Not some flamed-out has-been
who couldn't back it up 50 years ago.

208
00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:44.254
<i>Hello, you've reached the voicemail
of Danny Moore. Leave a message.</i>

209
00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:46.048
Tell Nissan I'll do it.

210
00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:48.842
I'm not spending another minute
with this pretentious clown show.

211
00:16:48.926 --> 00:16:50.969
I'll teach your gamer kids how to drive.

212
00:16:51.053 --> 00:16:53.347
They just gotta prove to me
that they can do it.

213
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:56.767
If I feel like it's unsafe,
I'm gonna walk.

214
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.852
Not gonna have blood on my hands.

215
00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:04.441
How we doing, gamers?

216
00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.864
My favorite sound in the world.
Sound of clicking. How we doing, brother?

217
00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.282
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

218
00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:18.622
Excuse me.

219
00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:21.124
-Can I get your help here, please?
-Yes. Of course you can.

220
00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:23.544
Hey.

221
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.632
You are joking.

222
00:17:29.258 --> 00:17:32.845
Bruv, you gotta see this.

223
00:17:37.266 --> 00:17:39.059
Dude, I've only got a minute. What's up?

224
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.907
Dude.

225
00:17:57.494 --> 00:18:00.122
-What is this?
-I saw this message on the screen.

226
00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:02.374
It says that the account
that was last logged in on this console

227
00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:04.585
got one of the fastest lap times
in the UK.

228
00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:05.794
Dude, it was your account.

229
00:18:05.878 --> 00:18:08.547
-Wait, this is a joke.
-No. It's a contest.

230
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.051
Press play, dude.

231
00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:18.640
<i>If you're one of the very, very few people
getting this message,</i>

232
00:18:18.724 --> 00:18:23.562
<i>it means that you set
the fastest lap time in </i>Gran Turismo.

233
00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:27.065
<i>There's a virtual race happening tomorrow.</i>

234
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:30.527
<i>Win it and a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity awaits you.</i>

235
00:18:30.611 --> 00:18:32.613
<i>We've created an academy</i>

236
00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:35.782
<i>to take the best SIM racers in the world</i>

237
00:18:35.866 --> 00:18:38.702
<i>and train them to race real race cars.</i>

238
00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:43.707
<i>We want to prove to the whole world
that the impossible dream can happen.</i>

239
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:47.711
Dude, this is real?

240
00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:50.506
It's as real as a ten-car pileup
on the M4. Bad example.

241
00:18:50.589 --> 00:18:52.424
You need to practice now.

242
00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:08.649
-Why don't you follow the race line?
-Just experimenting.

243
00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:13.820
See, the other drivers,
they follow that line.

244
00:19:13.904 --> 00:19:17.533
So if I go wide like this,

245
00:19:18.617 --> 00:19:20.410
sometimes I beat them.

246
00:19:20.494 --> 00:19:21.495
Like that.

247
00:19:23.664 --> 00:19:25.582
And if it doesn't work, I just reset.

248
00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:26.917
Night-night, son.

249
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.001
Night, Dad.

250
00:19:29.086 --> 00:19:32.005
<i>If you're getting this message,
it means that you're one</i>

251
00:19:32.089 --> 00:19:35.968
<i>of the best </i>Gran Turismo<i> players
in the world right now.</i>

252
00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:37.719
What?

253
00:19:38.637 --> 00:19:39.888
Looking at porn?

254
00:19:39.972 --> 00:19:41.640
-No. I'm not.
-Liar.

255
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.768
Come on.
We're throwing a party at the pier.

256
00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:46.144
Dude, you took the keys?

257
00:19:47.938 --> 00:19:50.941
Coby, you're on your last strike.
Mum will kill you if you get in trouble.

258
00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.776
That's why we're using your window.

259
00:19:53.402 --> 00:19:56.029
Sorry, man. I've gotta practice.

260
00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.867
I heard Audrey will be there.

261
00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:03.370
Come on.

262
00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:16.341
Coby, give me the keys.

263
00:20:16.425 --> 00:20:17.426
Nope.

264
00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:19.720
Let me drive.

265
00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:21.263
I'm a better driver, bruv.

266
00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:25.100
This is bullshit, Coby.
I can't believe I'm letting you drive.

267
00:20:25.184 --> 00:20:27.811
I can't believe I invited you.
Get in, Jann.

268
00:20:27.895 --> 00:20:29.897
You better not screw up Dad's car.

269
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:34.860
Drop the clutch.
I thought you could drive.

270
00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:39.656
Cheers, bruv.

271
00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.743
Simulate me, Janny!

272
00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.166
Hey.

273
00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:50.792
Hey.

274
00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:53.003
You having fun over here?

275
00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:58.509
Yeah, I was coming over in a sec.

276
00:20:58.592 --> 00:20:59.593
Yeah?

277
00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:01.929
We were just talking about traveling.

278
00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.139
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

279
00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:06.391
I don't know, do you ever just...

280
00:21:06.475 --> 00:21:10.479
wanna pack a bag
and leave here and never look back?

281
00:21:11.355 --> 00:21:12.397
All the time.

282
00:21:12.481 --> 00:21:13.690
-Yeah?
-Yes.

283
00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:15.692
Me too.

284
00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:21.323
You know, if there was one place
in the world that I could go,

285
00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:23.659
I think it would be New York.

286
00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:24.993
Why?

287
00:21:25.077 --> 00:21:26.995
I've heard they have good pizza.

288
00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:29.164
Yes. I've heard that too.

289
00:21:29.248 --> 00:21:30.666
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

290
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.001
What about you?

291
00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:36.588
This is stressful.

292
00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:41.426
Gun to your head, what's one place
you wanna go before you die?

293
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:42.928
Tokyo. Done.

294
00:21:43.512 --> 00:21:45.514
-Okay. Tokyo.
-Tokyo.

295
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.310
Is that because of the guy
who created your game?

296
00:21:50.394 --> 00:21:54.439
Yes, but technically it's not a game.

297
00:21:56.233 --> 00:21:58.569
I mean,
technically it's a racing simulator.

298
00:21:58.652 --> 00:22:00.612
Right. Okay.

299
00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.032
Sorry.

300
00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:08.036
What is it about racing
that you love so much?

301
00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.288
Well...

302
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:13.917
Sometimes when I'm driving,

303
00:22:14.001 --> 00:22:16.670
I can be going so fast,

304
00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:21.133
and everything else is moving so slow,

305
00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:25.470
and it's like the rest of the world
just falls away.

306
00:22:25.554 --> 00:22:28.307
It's just you and the car...

307
00:22:29.558 --> 00:22:30.809
and that's it.

308
00:22:30.893 --> 00:22:32.269
It's kind of magic.

309
00:22:32.352 --> 00:22:33.187
Magic.

310
00:22:34.688 --> 00:22:36.064
Put out the fire!

311
00:22:36.148 --> 00:22:37.316
Put it out!

312
00:22:38.984 --> 00:22:42.112
-I should probably get going.
-Yeah.

313
00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:43.530
My train leaves early.

314
00:22:45.115 --> 00:22:47.826
I bet Brighton is better than here.

315
00:22:48.619 --> 00:22:50.871
Yes. It is.

316
00:22:52.372 --> 00:22:55.584
DM me sometime, Jann.
I'll be watching for you.

317
00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:58.045
Good luck with the simulating.

318
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.423
-Bye.
-Thank you. Bye.

319
00:23:01.507 --> 00:23:02.841
Audrey, let's go!

320
00:23:06.929 --> 00:23:08.305
Oh, come on!

321
00:23:08.388 --> 00:23:10.516
You drive slower
than my grandmother! Let's go!

322
00:23:11.433 --> 00:23:13.977
Yeah, well, there's a reason
that I'm driving.

323
00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:15.479
I'm the sober one. Chill.

324
00:23:15.562 --> 00:23:17.439
Let's see if these guys got a beer for me.

325
00:23:17.523 --> 00:23:18.774
Hey!

326
00:23:18.857 --> 00:23:19.775
Hey!

327
00:23:21.068 --> 00:23:22.277
You got more beers there?

328
00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:25.447
Are you still thirsty, mate? I got you!

329
00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:28.116
Couple o' pints on me!

330
00:23:32.704 --> 00:23:34.289
You are kidding me.

331
00:23:34.373 --> 00:23:36.291
Oh, sit down. Stop.

332
00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:38.544
I'm done. Like, finished!

333
00:23:39.044 --> 00:23:40.879
The uni captain will pull my scholarship--

334
00:23:40.963 --> 00:23:42.005
Yo, shut up, shut up.

335
00:23:42.089 --> 00:23:43.340
Shush, shush, shush.

336
00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:46.969
All right, belts on. Get your belt on.

337
00:23:50.013 --> 00:23:51.890
My football career's over.

338
00:23:51.974 --> 00:23:53.600
What are we gonna do?

339
00:23:54.935 --> 00:23:56.645
We'll spend the night in jail
if they catch us now.

340
00:23:56.728 --> 00:23:57.563
Jail?

341
00:23:57.646 --> 00:24:00.190
No, what? No, we can't.

342
00:24:00.274 --> 00:24:01.108
Shut up!

343
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:05.946
They're pulling them over, not us.

344
00:24:07.364 --> 00:24:09.366
I'm not missing my race tomorrow.

345
00:24:13.954 --> 00:24:15.747
What the bloody hell are you doing?

346
00:24:22.629 --> 00:24:24.298
Oh, Jesus Christ!

347
00:24:26.049 --> 00:24:28.427
-I'm gonna puke.
-Yo, don't puke in my dad's car.

348
00:24:39.104 --> 00:24:40.230
Jann!

349
00:24:54.203 --> 00:24:55.913
Be chill, be chill, be chill.

350
00:25:02.127 --> 00:25:03.128
Have they gone?

351
00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:09.676
Yes, we're not going to jail!

352
00:25:20.229 --> 00:25:23.982
Bollocks. Oh, man.
He'll know I was drinking if you drove.

353
00:25:24.066 --> 00:25:26.193
-He could tell my coach.
-He's not telling him nothing.

354
00:25:26.276 --> 00:25:28.946
He wants you on the team
more than you wanna be on the team.

355
00:25:31.406 --> 00:25:33.700
Okay, say I'm the better driver
and I'll take the blame.

356
00:25:34.284 --> 00:25:37.496
Say I'm the better driver
and I'll take the blame. Say it.

357
00:25:37.579 --> 00:25:39.790
-Say I'm the better driver. Say it.
-You're the better driver.

358
00:25:46.713 --> 00:25:49.675
We couple the lead engine
with the cars, yeah?

359
00:25:49.758 --> 00:25:51.510
-Yes.
-Connect the rod.

360
00:25:52.553 --> 00:25:53.679
The pneumatics.

361
00:25:53.762 --> 00:25:54.638
Yep.

362
00:25:56.098 --> 00:25:57.391
Release.

363
00:25:58.934 --> 00:26:01.937
What's up? You in a hurry?
You got someplace to be?

364
00:26:02.563 --> 00:26:04.982
-Sorry. No.
-Yeah. Bring that up.

365
00:26:05.774 --> 00:26:07.401
Dad, obviously I'm happy to pay

366
00:26:07.484 --> 00:26:10.988
for the damage to the mirror
and the paintwork and stuff,

367
00:26:11.071 --> 00:26:16.451
but I was just wondering how many
of these sessions I have to do. You know?

368
00:26:16.535 --> 00:26:18.495
You think that's why you're here?

369
00:26:18.579 --> 00:26:19.830
Is it not?

370
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.126
You're not here
because you broke the mirror on the car,

371
00:26:24.209 --> 00:26:26.253
or because you took it without asking me.

372
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.505
Then why am I here?

373
00:26:28.589 --> 00:26:33.177
Because this is where you end up
when you don't have a plan.

374
00:26:34.803 --> 00:26:35.804
I'm sorry, wait.

375
00:26:37.973 --> 00:26:40.350
Am I here because I play <i>Gran Turismo?</i>

376
00:26:40.434 --> 00:26:43.061
You think you're gonna play
stupid video games about cars

377
00:26:43.145 --> 00:26:45.189
and you're gonna become a race car driver?

378
00:26:46.273 --> 00:26:49.443
Either you go back to school
and find something achievable,

379
00:26:49.985 --> 00:26:52.112
or you can join me here now.

380
00:26:52.196 --> 00:26:54.281
But there's no future in racing.

381
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:57.951
I'm done.

382
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.928
Pick up, pick up.

383
00:27:16.011 --> 00:27:17.930
<i>-I'm coming.
</i>-Dude, the race starts in two minutes.

384
00:27:18.013 --> 00:27:19.348
I need you to sign me in.

385
00:27:19.431 --> 00:27:21.558
<i>I have signed you in, but it's
a rolling start. I can't control it.</i>

386
00:27:21.642 --> 00:27:23.393
If I'm not there when the lights go green,
start the race.

387
00:27:23.477 --> 00:27:25.479
No. What? That's illegal, I can't do that.

388
00:27:25.562 --> 00:27:28.315
<i>-It's gotta be you that drives.
</i>-If I don't get this, I'm done.

389
00:27:28.398 --> 00:27:32.611
<i>We are moments away from the start
of the European qualifying race.</i>

390
00:27:32.694 --> 00:27:36.156
Come on, come on, come on.
Bruv, it's starting. It's starting!

391
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.242
<i>Best of luck to all you gamers out there.</i>

392
00:27:38.325 --> 00:27:39.243
Go, go, go!

393
00:27:39.326 --> 00:27:42.579
<i>Three, two, one...</i>

394
00:27:42.663 --> 00:27:43.872
<i>And we're off!</i>

395
00:27:45.207 --> 00:27:47.584
-Can you catch up?
-I think so.

396
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.964
-Persol, how many am I up against?
-It is you against the 19 best in Europe.

397
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.096
Okay, bro, you're in 17th position,
but you got ten laps to come back.

398
00:27:59.179 --> 00:28:01.390
We need a win
to go to GT Academy. Come on.

399
00:28:03.934 --> 00:28:05.811
Loosey-goosey, baby. Loosey-goosey.

400
00:28:09.189 --> 00:28:12.109
He's boxing you out.
You gotta do something.

401
00:28:12.818 --> 00:28:14.027
Time's running out.

402
00:28:24.496 --> 00:28:27.165
I'm taking the outside.
There's no time to dance.

403
00:28:49.813 --> 00:28:51.648
Yes, Jann. That's my boy.

404
00:28:52.524 --> 00:28:54.067
Two seconds back from the next car.

405
00:28:58.155 --> 00:28:59.698
This is it. Last lap, you gotta go.

406
00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:03.744
Come on, Jann!

407
00:29:03.827 --> 00:29:06.496
-Okay, second position just spun out.
-Oh, shit!

408
00:29:09.333 --> 00:29:10.834
I'm six seconds behind the leader.

409
00:29:12.169 --> 00:29:13.253
Final turn now.

410
00:29:13.337 --> 00:29:14.463
{\an8}Come on, Jann.

411
00:29:14.546 --> 00:29:15.547
Push it!

412
00:29:18.425 --> 00:29:19.760
Yes. Yes. Yes.

413
00:29:20.511 --> 00:29:22.054
That's him, that's him. There he is.

414
00:29:43.158 --> 00:29:46.370
<i>You'll let him walk out
without knowing who's operating this camp?</i>

415
00:29:46.453 --> 00:29:48.914
He's only off to Northampton.

416
00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:52.626
He's off to race cars. Do you have
any idea how dangerous that is?

417
00:29:52.709 --> 00:29:55.963
Dad, I'm sorry, you're the one that said,
"Go and do something real."

418
00:29:56.046 --> 00:29:58.549
Now I am, and it's too dangerous.
Make up your mind.

419
00:29:58.632 --> 00:30:01.176
Look, this has never
been done before, Jann.

420
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.470
It's a gimmick.
You've barely driven a real car.

421
00:30:03.554 --> 00:30:05.764
Dad, I've raced thousands of hours.

422
00:30:05.848 --> 00:30:07.891
But it's not the same, son.

423
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.354
Real drivers,
they're professional athletes. Not like--

424
00:30:14.565 --> 00:30:15.941
Dad, do you remember this day?

425
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.444
You took this of me when I was 5.

426
00:30:20.237 --> 00:30:23.782
All I've wanted to do since then
is be a racer.

427
00:30:28.704 --> 00:30:29.913
I am doing it.

428
00:30:32.749 --> 00:30:34.376
Whether you believe in me or not.

429
00:30:44.469 --> 00:30:47.014
<i>Welcome to the GT Academy.</i>

430
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.980
Hi.

431
00:30:58.317 --> 00:30:59.484
<i>The ten of you...</i>

432
00:31:01.653 --> 00:31:04.448
<i>hailing from eight different countries,</i>

433
00:31:04.531 --> 00:31:07.409
<i>are the best SIM racers</i>

434
00:31:08.327 --> 00:31:09.870
<i>in the world.</i>

435
00:31:12.831 --> 00:31:15.334
<i>You've overcome incredible odds
to be here.</i>

436
00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.253
<i>Now you stand on this track...</i>

437
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:22.341
<i>with enormous opportunity.</i>

438
00:31:22.424 --> 00:31:25.719
<i>The winner will earn a seat</i>

439
00:31:25.802 --> 00:31:27.679
<i>on Team Nissan...</i>

440
00:31:30.224 --> 00:31:33.894
and a place in racing history.

441
00:31:35.312 --> 00:31:39.149
Now, please meet our chief engineer,

442
00:31:39.233 --> 00:31:42.402
the man who's gonna teach you all
how to do it, Jack Salter.

443
00:31:42.486 --> 00:31:44.029
Dude's a fricking legend.

444
00:31:44.112 --> 00:31:46.698
So all these folks behind me are...

445
00:31:47.574 --> 00:31:51.703
keen on y'all proving
you can do the impossible.

446
00:31:52.704 --> 00:31:54.790
I'm here to prove that you can't.

447
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.674
Hi. What's your name?

448
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.926
Jann Mardenborough.

449
00:32:06.009 --> 00:32:08.220
Jann. Wow, you're tall.

450
00:32:08.303 --> 00:32:09.721
You fit in a race car?

451
00:32:10.347 --> 00:32:11.473
I don't know.

452
00:32:12.432 --> 00:32:15.018
I guess in the game I do.

453
00:32:17.938 --> 00:32:19.356
This is not a game.

454
00:32:27.531 --> 00:32:28.532
Racing.

455
00:32:29.116 --> 00:32:31.910
It takes strength,
it takes tremendous will,

456
00:32:33.203 --> 00:32:35.163
intelligence, sensitivity.

457
00:32:35.247 --> 00:32:38.625
There's only a handful of people
in the entire world

458
00:32:38.709 --> 00:32:41.837
who can do it at the level
that you're gonna be asked to do it.

459
00:32:42.588 --> 00:32:45.883
When you're in a race,
the g-forces will be twice

460
00:32:45.966 --> 00:32:49.720
what an astronaut experiences
upon liftoff.

461
00:32:50.345 --> 00:32:52.890
And it's under these conditions
that you're gonna be forced

462
00:32:52.973 --> 00:32:57.311
to make split-second decisions
that could cost you your life.

463
00:32:57.394 --> 00:32:58.729
Or worse...

464
00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:01.440
you could kill someone else.

465
00:33:02.524 --> 00:33:04.193
These are incredible stakes.

466
00:33:04.776 --> 00:33:07.112
And if you're not willing to risk it,

467
00:33:07.196 --> 00:33:09.323
I want you to walk away.

468
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.992
There's absolutely no shame.

469
00:33:12.659 --> 00:33:16.747
'Cause if you stay, I'm gonna push you
harder than you have ever been pushed,

470
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:20.334
and I am gonna prove
that you don't have what it takes.

471
00:33:20.417 --> 00:33:23.003
Because to take one look at any of you,

472
00:33:24.087 --> 00:33:26.256
I can already tell that you don't.

473
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.968
Welcome.

474
00:33:35.724 --> 00:33:37.559
Great pep talk, Churchill.

475
00:33:37.643 --> 00:33:39.061
I think they got the point.

476
00:33:39.144 --> 00:33:40.145
Look.

477
00:33:41.021 --> 00:33:42.481
This was my dream.

478
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.150
To take SIM racers,

479
00:33:46.276 --> 00:33:47.736
put them into real cars,

480
00:33:48.445 --> 00:33:51.907
<i>and have them race
against professional drivers.</i>

481
00:33:52.616 --> 00:33:57.037
<i>Now is your chance
to turn dreams into reality.</i>

482
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.163
<i>Let's go!</i>

483
00:34:03.919 --> 00:34:06.421
<i>This is the first time
you've been in a race car,</i>

484
00:34:06.505 --> 00:34:09.967
as opposed to sitting
in front of a computer screen.

485
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:13.428
{\an8}There's a lot of similarities
when it comes to throttle, braking.

486
00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.514
{\an8}How to take turns, how to use brakes,

487
00:34:16.598 --> 00:34:17.891
find your line on the track.

488
00:34:17.975 --> 00:34:20.601
I think this is the chance
we've all been looking for,

489
00:34:20.686 --> 00:34:22.688
{\an8}to become what we wanted to.

490
00:34:22.771 --> 00:34:25.399
{\an8}You never know how high you can achieve.

491
00:34:25.482 --> 00:34:27.734
-Dreams can come true.
-All right, Jann.

492
00:34:27.818 --> 00:34:29.194
{\an8}-Jann?
-Yes.

493
00:34:29.277 --> 00:34:32.906
And just remember this whole thing
is about press readiness, okay?

494
00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:35.449
When did you know
that you wanted to be a racer?

495
00:34:37.034 --> 00:34:39.496
{\an8}Well, I liked cars since I was a kid.

496
00:34:43.667 --> 00:34:45.043
Go, go, go. Come on.

497
00:34:45.127 --> 00:34:47.754
You're going
to compete in different exercises

498
00:34:47.838 --> 00:34:52.301
<i>so that we can determine whose SIM skills
translate to driving a real car.</i>

499
00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:57.097
<i>I wasn't prepared for just how physical</i>

500
00:34:57.181 --> 00:34:58.974
{\an8}the demands of the car were gonna be.

501
00:34:59.057 --> 00:35:01.602
{\an8}<i>-What do you think about your competitors?
-They're great.</i>

502
00:35:02.227 --> 00:35:03.270
<i>How about Matty?</i>

503
00:35:03.896 --> 00:35:06.565
{\an8}To each his own. He's obviously
very confident. Good for him.

504
00:35:06.648 --> 00:35:07.649
What do you think about Jann?

505
00:35:07.733 --> 00:35:11.820
{\an8}Jann is the same as any other driver
on the track. Just another car to pass.

506
00:35:11.904 --> 00:35:12.946
Matty with the answers.

507
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:15.073
Better strap in too, man.
We're about to go fast.

508
00:35:15.157 --> 00:35:16.158
Let's see it.

509
00:35:17.034 --> 00:35:17.951
<i>We're gamers.</i>

510
00:35:18.035 --> 00:35:19.494
{\an8}We're competitive people.

511
00:35:19.578 --> 00:35:21.330
<i>Let's go, keep it clean. Come on!</i>

512
00:35:23.123 --> 00:35:24.166
Oh, God.

513
00:35:24.249 --> 00:35:26.293
This entire thing is
a marketing extravaganza.

514
00:35:26.376 --> 00:35:28.587
Get in the chopper.
Let us get a few shots.

515
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.464
-Doing what?
-Follow the kids around the track,

516
00:35:30.547 --> 00:35:33.717
make some notes,
act like an engineer, look cool.

517
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.803
There's no way I would evaluate
race car drivers from a helicopter.

518
00:35:36.887 --> 00:35:39.640
It's the dumbest thing
I have ever heard in my whole life.

519
00:35:40.432 --> 00:35:41.850
I'm not getting in that thing.

520
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:52.694
Looking good, Matty.
You're looking good on the straight there.

521
00:35:52.778 --> 00:35:53.737
<i>Nice line.</i>

522
00:35:57.574 --> 00:35:59.326
<i>Come on, you gotta go. Punch it!</i>

523
00:36:00.244 --> 00:36:03.705
<i>I will be your judge. I will be your jury.</i>

524
00:36:04.289 --> 00:36:06.875
All right, come on, you gamer kids.

525
00:36:06.959 --> 00:36:09.253
This must be a new experience for you.

526
00:36:09.336 --> 00:36:11.171
Last time you stretched your legs

527
00:36:11.255 --> 00:36:15.175
was to go get another packet
of Hot Pockets from the freezer.

528
00:36:15.259 --> 00:36:16.927
You get tired, you get sloppy.

529
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.554
You get sloppy, you get hurt.

530
00:36:18.637 --> 00:36:20.430
Then you lose races!

531
00:36:20.514 --> 00:36:23.684
{\an8}I heard your trainer Jack can be
a little hard on the team.

532
00:36:23.767 --> 00:36:25.394
{\an8}I mean, he means it well.

533
00:36:25.477 --> 00:36:27.229
<i>He's tough, but it's like tough love.</i>

534
00:36:27.312 --> 00:36:29.022
I need you to be faster than this.

535
00:36:29.106 --> 00:36:31.400
Don't think, just react.

536
00:36:31.483 --> 00:36:34.862
You're gonna be hot in the car.
You're gonna be tired. Focus!

537
00:36:36.822 --> 00:36:38.448
{\an8}Jack thinks we just suck.

538
00:36:38.532 --> 00:36:41.743
Grabbed a bunch of cones back there.
Extra points!

539
00:36:41.827 --> 00:36:44.121
And I will decide who is eliminated.

540
00:36:47.291 --> 00:36:49.251
Close that gap. Let's close that gap.

541
00:36:57.134 --> 00:36:58.552
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

542
00:36:58.635 --> 00:36:59.761
No!

543
00:37:01.054 --> 00:37:02.556
Jesus Christ.

544
00:37:05.684 --> 00:37:07.269
Sorry about the car.

545
00:37:08.353 --> 00:37:09.188
Good luck.

546
00:37:09.271 --> 00:37:11.064
<i>We'll cut you down to five.</i>

547
00:37:11.148 --> 00:37:13.066
<i>Those five will compete in a final race.</i>

548
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.818
Bye!

549
00:37:15.861 --> 00:37:17.654
Keep going! Keep going!

550
00:37:17.738 --> 00:37:21.283
<i>If your name's below the red line
at the end of this, you're out.</i>

551
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.079
You're ruining my enjoyment
of these chips.

552
00:37:28.999 --> 00:37:29.833
Hello.

553
00:37:30.584 --> 00:37:33.795
{\an8}I didn't think it was gonna be
so physically demanding.

554
00:37:35.839 --> 00:37:37.466
You puked on my lawn.

555
00:37:37.549 --> 00:37:39.051
<i>Goodbye, Henry.</i>

556
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:47.434
No, no, no. Come on, come on!

557
00:37:51.396 --> 00:37:53.065
Goodbye, Chloe.

558
00:37:53.148 --> 00:37:58.028
I wasn't into sports and I didn't know
that we had so much working out.

559
00:37:58.111 --> 00:37:59.196
Klaus.

560
00:38:00.739 --> 00:38:01.949
Can I have a word?

561
00:38:02.783 --> 00:38:05.661
Good effort, son.
Here's a cap and a shirt for you.

562
00:38:05.744 --> 00:38:08.080
See that car? That'll take you home.

563
00:38:10.666 --> 00:38:11.834
Bye, Klaus.

564
00:38:12.459 --> 00:38:14.086
<i>What's your biggest fear?</i>

565
00:38:15.128 --> 00:38:18.340
{\an8}I guess going home
and proving everybody right.

566
00:38:21.718 --> 00:38:22.761
<i>You know, that...</i>

567
00:38:23.345 --> 00:38:27.474
{\an8}that this, it was impossible
and this wasn't meant to be.

568
00:38:27.558 --> 00:38:30.894
Passing is the art of conviction.

569
00:38:30.978 --> 00:38:32.604
<i>You're coming into turn 15.</i>

570
00:38:32.688 --> 00:38:35.774
It's got a late apex. The exit tightens.

571
00:38:35.858 --> 00:38:37.484
You gotta find your moment to pass.

572
00:38:37.568 --> 00:38:38.944
Come on. What you got? What you got?

573
00:38:39.027 --> 00:38:41.029
Come on, there's a gap. Go, go, go.

574
00:38:41.113 --> 00:38:42.364
<i>Wait for the window.</i>

575
00:38:43.198 --> 00:38:45.659
Come on, turn it! Go! Go, go, go, go!

576
00:38:51.748 --> 00:38:52.958
Not today.

577
00:38:56.587 --> 00:38:58.547
-Brake! Brake!
-I'm trying!

578
00:39:03.343 --> 00:39:04.344
Good night.

579
00:39:08.432 --> 00:39:09.433
You okay?

580
00:39:09.516 --> 00:39:11.310
Jesus Christ.

581
00:39:11.977 --> 00:39:12.978
I braked.

582
00:39:16.315 --> 00:39:17.149
Jesus.

583
00:39:17.232 --> 00:39:19.026
But I braked. I braked, I braked.

584
00:39:19.902 --> 00:39:21.987
-I'm so sorry.
-You can't be afraid in the car.

585
00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.531
I wasn't afraid. I braked.
I don't know what happened.

586
00:39:24.615 --> 00:39:25.866
Gotta commit!

587
00:39:25.949 --> 00:39:27.451
You okay? You okay?

588
00:39:28.368 --> 00:39:29.411
It work in your game?

589
00:39:29.494 --> 00:39:31.413
Are you okay? Are you okay?

590
00:39:43.592 --> 00:39:45.302
<i>Dude, you crashed a car with Jack inside.</i>

591
00:39:46.929 --> 00:39:48.222
That was insane.

592
00:39:48.889 --> 00:39:49.973
Terrifying.

593
00:39:50.057 --> 00:39:52.017
Listen, you gotta commit.

594
00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.646
You know if you don't commit
in the turn, it's our lives on the line.

595
00:39:55.729 --> 00:39:56.647
Uncanny.

596
00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.484
I don't know if I was more scared
of the crash or of Jack.

597
00:40:01.235 --> 00:40:04.321
-You actually got a bit lucky.
-Yeah, I think I did.

598
00:40:04.905 --> 00:40:08.534
Clearly, I mean, you haven't been
behind the wheel before, have you?

599
00:40:08.617 --> 00:40:10.953
No, I don't think any of us have.

600
00:40:11.036 --> 00:40:13.497
The whole point is
to find someone who hasn't.

601
00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.416
Well, I think
the point is to win. Isn't it?

602
00:40:17.626 --> 00:40:18.919
Is there a problem?

603
00:40:19.002 --> 00:40:20.379
I don't know. Is there?

604
00:40:22.256 --> 00:40:23.757
I'm in first place, baby.

605
00:40:23.841 --> 00:40:25.300
-He's humble too.
-Yeah.

606
00:40:25.384 --> 00:40:26.885
But you heard Jack.

607
00:40:26.969 --> 00:40:28.637
I mean, there's no shame
in going home, right?

608
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.682
-Yeah, did you hear that?
-That's exactly what I heard.

609
00:40:37.938 --> 00:40:40.274
If you're not gonna commit to a pass...

610
00:40:43.235 --> 00:40:48.156
If you, in the moment,
you decide, "I'm not gonna go"...

611
00:40:50.075 --> 00:40:52.077
I mean, you gotta fall back,
you gotta brake early...

612
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.413
I tried. The brakes didn't respond.

613
00:40:54.496 --> 00:40:55.330
Excuse me?

614
00:40:59.251 --> 00:41:01.587
I tried to brake and the brakes didn't--

615
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:03.213
Brakes not working?

616
00:41:03.297 --> 00:41:05.382
That's not what I said.
But I felt like they were glazed.

617
00:41:05.465 --> 00:41:08.635
Oh, they were glazed. Yeah.
They were glazed.

618
00:41:08.719 --> 00:41:11.096
How do you know?
How do you know something like that?

619
00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.056
'Cause I've been driving
these cars for years.

620
00:41:14.308 --> 00:41:15.475
In a video game.

621
00:41:16.977 --> 00:41:19.271
We're in real life now, okay?

622
00:41:19.354 --> 00:41:20.606
This is reality.

623
00:41:22.983 --> 00:41:24.443
If you're not gonna commit,

624
00:41:24.526 --> 00:41:28.280
if you're not gonna have conviction
on that track...

625
00:41:29.948 --> 00:41:31.992
<i>you make mistakes like that,</i>

626
00:41:32.075 --> 00:41:34.286
next time we might not be so lucky.

627
00:41:37.706 --> 00:41:39.750
That's it. Get out.

628
00:41:49.259 --> 00:41:52.346
Why do you think we're here?
Because we know how these cars work.

629
00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:54.598
I know what I'm talking about.
I'm not afraid.

630
00:41:59.269 --> 00:42:00.312
Come on, man.

631
00:42:00.979 --> 00:42:03.565
Been doing this for 25 years.

632
00:42:04.441 --> 00:42:06.652
I know when someone's afraid.

633
00:42:06.735 --> 00:42:10.697
Best-case scenario, that guy doesn't win.

634
00:42:14.034 --> 00:42:15.827
And that's what we got here.

635
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.165
There's no shame in that. It's okay.

636
00:42:20.249 --> 00:42:24.336
It's a small percentage of the population
that can do this, all right?

637
00:42:24.419 --> 00:42:25.420
I get it.

638
00:42:26.046 --> 00:42:27.923
But it's time to quit.

639
00:42:28.006 --> 00:42:29.591
If those brakes don't turn out
to be glazed,

640
00:42:29.675 --> 00:42:30.843
you're going home anyways.

641
00:42:59.496 --> 00:43:02.040
He was right. The brakes are glazed.

642
00:43:24.229 --> 00:43:25.063
Hey.

643
00:43:34.156 --> 00:43:35.866
How'd you know that about the car?

644
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:41.330
I've spent hours setting up cars in <i>GT.</i>

645
00:43:42.539 --> 00:43:46.251
You know, I know you think
it's just a simulator, but it's good.

646
00:43:50.422 --> 00:43:51.715
Tomorrow's your shot.

647
00:43:52.758 --> 00:43:54.134
Marcel's out.

648
00:43:55.093 --> 00:43:56.803
<i>You're in the final five.</i>

649
00:43:56.887 --> 00:43:58.430
Final race in the morning.

650
00:44:05.395 --> 00:44:08.315
Yes!

651
00:44:08.398 --> 00:44:09.566
Yes!

652
00:44:34.842 --> 00:44:36.009
Do you hear this?

653
00:44:36.844 --> 00:44:37.678
Yeah.

654
00:44:41.098 --> 00:44:41.932
Dude.

655
00:44:42.516 --> 00:44:44.226
-Jann.
-What?

656
00:44:45.769 --> 00:44:47.437
What the hell is that?

657
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:49.022
It's Kenny G.

658
00:44:49.982 --> 00:44:50.983
Who's Kenny G?

659
00:44:51.066 --> 00:44:53.694
Dude, we have a huge race tomorrow.
It's just chilling me out.

660
00:44:54.278 --> 00:44:55.279
I'll turn it down.

661
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.114
Sorry.

662
00:44:58.740 --> 00:44:59.575
Dude.

663
00:45:40.073 --> 00:45:41.491
<i>All right. This is it.</i>

664
00:45:44.828 --> 00:45:46.455
<i>This is what it's all been leading to.</i>

665
00:45:50.959 --> 00:45:52.461
<i>This is not a game.</i>

666
00:45:53.879 --> 00:45:55.214
<i>This is a race.</i>

667
00:45:57.758 --> 00:46:01.053
<i>All your weeks here at the GT Academy
have led to this,</i>

668
00:46:01.136 --> 00:46:03.805
<i>and I've imparted to you
everything I know about racing.</i>

669
00:46:05.057 --> 00:46:08.727
<i>Now it's time for you
to show me what you've got</i>

670
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:11.021
{\an8}<i>and what kind of competitors you are.</i>

671
00:46:14.316 --> 00:46:16.026
<i>There will be a winner.</i>

672
00:46:17.319 --> 00:46:18.695
And there will be...

673
00:46:19.905 --> 00:46:20.906
losers.

674
00:46:21.615 --> 00:46:22.699
Good luck.

675
00:46:30.499 --> 00:46:31.500
It's a...

676
00:46:32.918 --> 00:46:36.338
It's a family thing.
It's the team my dad used to play for.

677
00:46:52.896 --> 00:46:54.106
It's just a game.

678
00:46:56.316 --> 00:46:58.026
<i>Course is green. Track is all clear.</i>

679
00:46:59.403 --> 00:47:03.156
<i>All cars on the grid.
Safety vehicles released to the track.</i>

680
00:47:03.949 --> 00:47:05.951
You're playing a game. It's just a game.

681
00:47:06.034 --> 00:47:08.537
When in doubt, throttle out.

682
00:47:14.042 --> 00:47:15.127
You got this.

683
00:47:27.347 --> 00:47:29.349
<i>These cars are heavy and fast.</i>

684
00:47:31.977 --> 00:47:33.437
<i>Control those vehicles.</i>

685
00:47:48.118 --> 00:47:48.994
Yes!

686
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.373
No!

687
00:47:55.375 --> 00:47:57.961
Yes. Yes!

688
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.177
<i>Completed lap 2.</i>

689
00:48:07.304 --> 00:48:08.847
<i>Three laps to go.</i>

690
00:48:10.224 --> 00:48:11.391
<i>Those are nice splits.</i>

691
00:48:13.268 --> 00:48:14.561
Try harder, Jann.

692
00:48:22.819 --> 00:48:23.904
Damn it!

693
00:48:25.531 --> 00:48:26.573
Yes.

694
00:48:31.537 --> 00:48:32.955
Oh, there you are. Okay.

695
00:48:44.591 --> 00:48:46.385
<i>This is it. Final lap.</i>

696
00:48:46.468 --> 00:48:47.511
Come on, Jann.

697
00:48:49.179 --> 00:48:50.264
Commit.

698
00:48:51.515 --> 00:48:52.641
Commit!

699
00:49:03.402 --> 00:49:05.445
Okay, you came to drive, Stretch!

700
00:49:21.211 --> 00:49:22.045
No.

701
00:49:25.549 --> 00:49:26.592
No!

702
00:49:27.342 --> 00:49:28.760
No! No.

703
00:49:29.386 --> 00:49:30.387
Come on, Jann.

704
00:49:45.277 --> 00:49:47.029
Come on, Matty. Do it, baby. Come on.

705
00:49:51.158 --> 00:49:52.326
Yes. Come on.

706
00:49:59.583 --> 00:50:01.418
-Matty took it.
-No, wait, wait, wait.

707
00:50:01.502 --> 00:50:03.128
No, no, no, hang on, hang on.

708
00:50:03.212 --> 00:50:06.256
We gotta watch that back.
Can I get playback?

709
00:50:08.425 --> 00:50:09.426
Guys.

710
00:50:10.135 --> 00:50:11.261
<i>Was that me that--?</i>

711
00:50:14.056 --> 00:50:16.016
Did I win? Who had that?

712
00:50:31.198 --> 00:50:32.449
Mate, who won?

713
00:50:32.533 --> 00:50:34.451
I don't know. I don't know.

714
00:50:37.079 --> 00:50:38.121
Rewind a little.

715
00:50:40.499 --> 00:50:41.500
Zoom in there.

716
00:50:44.711 --> 00:50:47.172
No. Mardenborough won.

717
00:50:48.215 --> 00:50:50.801
-Announce it.
-Hold on. Hold on.

718
00:50:50.884 --> 00:50:52.427
Jack. Jack.

719
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:58.100
Is this really what we want?

720
00:50:59.017 --> 00:51:02.855
Just look at this from
a high-level marketing perspective, okay?

721
00:51:03.647 --> 00:51:05.732
Does Jann give us the best shot?

722
00:51:05.816 --> 00:51:07.860
I don't know what that means. He won.

723
00:51:07.943 --> 00:51:09.278
By a thousandth of a second.

724
00:51:09.361 --> 00:51:11.822
Yeah, that's the difference
between winning and losing. Jann won.

725
00:51:12.698 --> 00:51:13.532
<i>Jann...</i>

726
00:51:14.199 --> 00:51:17.661
Look, he stumbles in front of the camera.
He's not press-ready. He's not confident.

727
00:51:17.744 --> 00:51:19.955
The whole idea of this thing, Jack,

728
00:51:20.038 --> 00:51:22.666
it hangs on one
of these two kids' shoulders.

729
00:51:23.917 --> 00:51:26.753
Matty's a millionth of a second behind.
I mean, who cares?

730
00:51:26.837 --> 00:51:30.299
He is ultimately our best pick
when you take him out into the world.

731
00:51:35.095 --> 00:51:36.096
-Who won?
-Right.

732
00:51:37.848 --> 00:51:39.224
Yep. Copy that.

733
00:51:39.308 --> 00:51:40.934
The winner is...

734
00:51:45.355 --> 00:51:47.608
-You are the winner.
-Yes!

735
00:51:50.611 --> 00:51:52.154
Way to go, Jann!

736
00:51:54.573 --> 00:51:56.491
Well, and so it begins.

737
00:52:40.035 --> 00:52:41.745
<i>-Hello, sweetheart.
</i>-Mum.

738
00:52:42.663 --> 00:52:45.123
I kind of won GT Academy.

739
00:52:45.207 --> 00:52:48.752
<i>Really? That's amazing. I'm happy for you.</i>

740
00:52:48.836 --> 00:52:49.920
Yeah, it was amazing.

741
00:52:50.003 --> 00:52:53.298
It was incredible.
You would have loved it.

742
00:52:53.382 --> 00:52:55.425
-I wish you were here.
<i>-I wish I was there too.</i>

743
00:52:56.301 --> 00:52:58.512
Where's Dad? I wanna tell him.

744
00:52:58.595 --> 00:53:01.223
<i>He's just left for Coby's game.</i>

745
00:53:01.306 --> 00:53:02.683
<i>But I'll let him know.</i>

746
00:53:02.766 --> 00:53:04.434
<i>I'm really proud of you.</i>

747
00:53:04.518 --> 00:53:06.562
Yeah. It's mental.

748
00:53:07.437 --> 00:53:10.357
Yeah, they're taking me
on a Learjet to Vienna tomorrow.

749
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.692
<i>I'll be watching.</i>

750
00:53:11.775 --> 00:53:13.026
<i>And I love you.</i>

751
00:53:13.777 --> 00:53:14.778
I love you back.

752
00:53:21.535 --> 00:53:22.703
A little bit of bubbly.

753
00:53:23.328 --> 00:53:25.789
First time on a private jet.
Here, have a glass.

754
00:53:25.873 --> 00:53:27.916
-Sweet. Thanks.
-Ah, sorry.

755
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.170
Champagne is for the podium only.

756
00:53:32.004 --> 00:53:33.964
We'll take a couple beers.
Thank you very much.

757
00:53:34.047 --> 00:53:36.258
That's fair. Let's save it for a win.

758
00:53:37.509 --> 00:53:41.597
Nissan has agreed to fund you
through the Dubai enduro,

759
00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.682
under the condition
you get your racing license.

760
00:53:43.765 --> 00:53:46.435
So we'll start in the European series.
You following?

761
00:53:46.518 --> 00:53:47.519
Yes.

762
00:53:47.603 --> 00:53:50.939
You've gotta finish fourth place or better
in just one race of the series

763
00:53:51.023 --> 00:53:52.649
to get your FIA license.

764
00:53:52.733 --> 00:53:55.611
When you get that license,
Nissan will give you a contract.

765
00:53:56.445 --> 00:53:58.864
You're not gonna be racing against gamers.

766
00:53:58.947 --> 00:54:01.491
These guys are
legit professional athletes.

767
00:54:02.326 --> 00:54:04.119
You don't have
the strength and the stamina

768
00:54:04.203 --> 00:54:08.165
to compete at this level at this point,
but we'll get into all that.

769
00:54:08.248 --> 00:54:11.752
For this one, though,
you gotta prove that you belong.

770
00:54:11.835 --> 00:54:14.546
And nobody's gonna welcome you
into this world.

771
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:17.508
The other drivers, your pit crew,

772
00:54:17.591 --> 00:54:19.426
nobody wants you there.

773
00:54:20.302 --> 00:54:24.473
If you have any feedback about anything,

774
00:54:24.556 --> 00:54:26.058
you're gonna tell me.

775
00:54:26.642 --> 00:54:30.270
'Cause the mechanics are going
to hate you.

776
00:54:34.566 --> 00:54:35.567
Okay.

777
00:54:36.401 --> 00:54:39.821
I'm gonna get some sleep
'cause I can't stand flying.

778
00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:42.783
Get some rest.

779
00:54:43.617 --> 00:54:44.701
He's fun.

780
00:54:48.038 --> 00:54:49.039
Seriously...

781
00:54:50.123 --> 00:54:51.500
Jack was a great racer.

782
00:54:52.167 --> 00:54:53.502
I mean, possibly...

783
00:54:54.169 --> 00:54:58.048
could have been one of the best Americans
of his generation, actually.

784
00:54:59.341 --> 00:55:00.342
He quit.

785
00:55:01.093 --> 00:55:01.927
Why?

786
00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:05.389
Well, that's between you and him.

787
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.686
Yes.

788
00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:20.320
Welcome to Vienna, Jann.

789
00:56:24.635 --> 00:56:26.929
<i>Welcome to Spielberg in Austria.</i>

790
00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:29.306
<i>This one's got a bit of everything.</i>

791
00:56:29.389 --> 00:56:31.934
<i>Heavy braking zones
but also a lot of fast sections.</i>

792
00:57:09.221 --> 00:57:10.722
I'll be on comms the whole time.

793
00:57:13.559 --> 00:57:15.894
You'll be fine. Stay with me.

794
00:57:18.105 --> 00:57:22.526
Good news. No one thinks we can do this,
so low expectations.

795
00:57:27.906 --> 00:57:28.740
Hey.

796
00:57:31.702 --> 00:57:32.703
You got this.

797
00:58:22.085 --> 00:58:24.213
-Blankets off.
-Copy.

798
00:58:31.595 --> 00:58:32.596
Comms check.

799
00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.765
Yeah, got you.

800
00:59:00.874 --> 00:59:05.087
<i>All right, it's a rolling start.
Let's get those tires nice and warm.</i>

801
00:59:06.588 --> 00:59:11.009
<i>They're trying to generate as much heat
in the tires as they possibly can.</i>

802
00:59:11.093 --> 00:59:14.346
<i>I don't know exactly how much bandwidth
you have for this right now,</i>

803
00:59:14.429 --> 00:59:15.639
<i>but I feel like we should talk</i>

804
00:59:15.722 --> 00:59:17.599
about some of the players
on the field today.

805
00:59:17.683 --> 00:59:22.604
<i>First of all, my favorite is the guy
in the gold lamé monstrosity over there.</i>

806
00:59:22.688 --> 00:59:23.814
<i>That's Team Capa.</i>

807
00:59:23.897 --> 00:59:26.900
The guy in the white Audi
with the rainbows on it, that's Schulin.

808
00:59:26.984 --> 00:59:28.819
<i>He's gonna be the other bully
on the track today.</i>

809
00:59:32.281 --> 00:59:34.199
I think the thing you have to remember--

810
00:59:34.283 --> 00:59:37.703
This is a first, a world first,
so we're already winning.

811
00:59:37.786 --> 00:59:40.539
<i>You gotta have nerves of steel
coming down into turn one,</i>

812
00:59:40.622 --> 00:59:42.541
<i>as we approach the start line.</i>

813
00:59:42.624 --> 00:59:45.043
<i>Okay, Jann, when that light turns green,
it's go time.</i>

814
00:59:45.127 --> 00:59:48.172
<i>Green, green! Go, go, go!</i>

815
00:59:54.386 --> 00:59:57.598
<i>All right, come on,
keep your nose in it. Let's do this.</i>

816
00:59:57.681 --> 00:59:59.850
<i>Whoa, welcoming committee.</i>

817
01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:05.522
<i>-On your left!
</i>-What the--? Shit.

818
01:00:11.153 --> 01:00:13.071
You're all right.
You're all right. Just breathe.

819
01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:15.240
<i>-Just breathe.
</i>-Okay, come on, Jann.

820
01:00:16.116 --> 01:00:18.160
Focus, focus, focus.

821
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:22.664
Let's go.

822
01:00:26.126 --> 01:00:29.087
<i>Heading into turn one,
they're tipping on 300 kilometers an hour.</i>

823
01:00:35.552 --> 01:00:37.346
<i>Get out from behind him.</i>

824
01:00:39.515 --> 01:00:41.934
Take the inside! You'll be fine.

825
01:00:42.017 --> 01:00:45.771
<i>Cars explode all the time.
This is normal. Stay focused.</i>

826
01:00:45.854 --> 01:00:48.190
{\an8}<i>It's a disaster for the red Ferrari.</i>

827
01:00:55.239 --> 01:00:58.242
{\an8}<i>He's not used to this kind of stuff,
so he needs to focus.</i>

828
01:00:58.325 --> 01:01:00.536
Jack, how am I doing for fuel?

829
01:01:04.164 --> 01:01:07.084
<i>All right, low fuel.
Next time around, come in to gas up.</i>

830
01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:09.962
<i>First pit stop
for Jann Mardenborough and Nissan.</i>

831
01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:11.755
Let's go, go, go!

832
01:01:12.714 --> 01:01:14.091
Come on, come on!

833
01:01:19.429 --> 01:01:21.431
It's much easier with a joystick,
isn't it?

834
01:01:22.266 --> 01:01:23.600
Noob!

835
01:01:23.684 --> 01:01:24.852
Hey, hey! Listen to me!

836
01:01:25.561 --> 01:01:27.396
Keep it together out there, all right?

837
01:01:27.479 --> 01:01:29.731
Breathe! I don't want you to oversteer!

838
01:01:29.815 --> 01:01:31.817
I want you to keep it together!

839
01:01:34.695 --> 01:01:37.281
<i>That was pretty textbook
from the Nissan pit crew.</i>

840
01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.542
<i>You've got a good run on him.
Pass him on the right.</i>

841
01:01:51.503 --> 01:01:52.796
Watch out for Nismo, coming up behind you!

842
01:01:53.922 --> 01:01:56.508
No! You let him take the inside!

843
01:01:58.802 --> 01:01:59.803
Shit! Damn gamer!

844
01:01:59.887 --> 01:02:02.347
<i>That's a great job
from Jann Mardenborough.</i>

845
01:02:02.431 --> 01:02:04.975
Hey. That was actually pretty great.

846
01:02:11.732 --> 01:02:14.067
<i>You're coming up on Capa.
He's right ahead.</i>

847
01:02:27.539 --> 01:02:31.710
<i>Fourth place! All we gotta do is hold
and we got that license.</i>

848
01:02:36.882 --> 01:02:38.634
Where do you think you're going, amateur?

849
01:02:43.597 --> 01:02:46.141
All right, watch out for Capa.
He's coming on your outside.

850
01:02:46.225 --> 01:02:48.644
<i>This guy plays dirty. Watch out for that.</i>

851
01:02:49.186 --> 01:02:51.188
I'm gonna nerf you, gamer.

852
01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:52.898
<i>Four back. Three back.</i>

853
01:03:19.925 --> 01:03:21.426
Goddamn it.

854
01:03:38.318 --> 01:03:41.572
<i>So it's a P-27 over the line
for Jann Mardenborough.</i>

855
01:03:41.655 --> 01:03:43.615
<i>Possible naivete through the final...</i>

856
01:03:48.912 --> 01:03:52.833
Well, at least you finished.
I didn't even think you'd do that.

857
01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:55.002
Noob.

858
01:04:05.596 --> 01:04:07.097
It's an okay start.

859
01:04:07.181 --> 01:04:10.976
There's still six more events this season,
so we'll qualify, all right?

860
01:04:19.193 --> 01:04:20.819
So how are we feeling?

861
01:04:20.903 --> 01:04:23.822
Are you still happy about
the choice we made?

862
01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.241
Gotta give him some time.

863
01:04:27.534 --> 01:04:29.036
All right. It's on you.

864
01:04:33.624 --> 01:04:34.708
I'm sorry, man.

865
01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:38.462
It's okay. First race. First race.

866
01:04:39.046 --> 01:04:39.880
Yeah.

867
01:04:39.963 --> 01:04:41.590
Crazy out there, isn't it?

868
01:04:42.633 --> 01:04:43.634
It's insane.

869
01:04:45.177 --> 01:04:46.428
All right, well...

870
01:04:48.096 --> 01:04:51.433
We're gonna focus on strength,
we're gonna focus on endurance.

871
01:04:51.517 --> 01:04:53.894
You're gonna feel better,
you're gonna feel stronger with each race.

872
01:05:19.461 --> 01:05:21.922
Jack. Jack, hello? Is this working?

873
01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.633
<i>Jack! Hello? Jack! Hello.</i>

874
01:05:24.716 --> 01:05:26.969
Jack? Are you--?
Shit. I think my radio's broken.

875
01:05:27.052 --> 01:05:29.429
Hello, Jack? Someone answer me!

876
01:05:39.523 --> 01:05:41.233
I got a good feeling about this one.

877
01:05:41.942 --> 01:05:42.943
You got this.

878
01:05:46.446 --> 01:05:49.700
<i>Another disappointing finish
for Mardenborough.</i>

879
01:06:07.467 --> 01:06:09.052
Come on. Run, run, run!

880
01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:22.024
Look alive, look alive!
Hey, watch the gravel trap.

881
01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:46.381
Nicholas, Nicholas! Nicholas!
What's your take on SIM racers?

882
01:06:46.465 --> 01:06:49.134
I'm worried, you know? They make it
less safe for the real drivers.

883
01:06:49.218 --> 01:06:51.303
Do you think a SIM racer can ever win?

884
01:06:51.386 --> 01:06:53.013
You won't see them on a podium.

885
01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:56.517
Okay, that's enough for now.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

886
01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.644
Come on.
Let us through, let us through.

887
01:06:58.727 --> 01:07:01.438
Hey. Hey.
Don't worry about him, all right?

888
01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:03.941
He's not a better driver than you.

889
01:07:06.818 --> 01:07:08.153
He's got a bigger allowance.

890
01:07:22.543 --> 01:07:23.544
Shit!

891
01:07:23.627 --> 01:07:25.379
<i>Whoa, don't let him take that line.</i>

892
01:07:25.462 --> 01:07:27.381
-Come on, he's pushing you wide.
-Bullshit.

893
01:07:27.464 --> 01:07:28.799
<i>Do it!</i>

894
01:07:31.718 --> 01:07:33.136
Whoopsie.

895
01:07:34.596 --> 01:07:35.514
Shit!

896
01:07:36.765 --> 01:07:39.768
<i>The Dubai Autodrome, here in the UAE.</i>

897
01:07:45.691 --> 01:07:47.442
<i>Is the car functioning all right?</i>

898
01:07:47.526 --> 01:07:50.529
Jann, is the car functioning okay?

899
01:07:50.612 --> 01:07:52.614
<i>Fine! The car's okay.</i>

900
01:07:52.698 --> 01:07:53.907
It's functioning, yes.

901
01:07:53.991 --> 01:07:56.702
Okay. Okay, get back in the fight, then.

902
01:07:56.785 --> 01:08:00.414
<i>This is the last chance you have
to qualify for your license.</i>

903
01:08:00.497 --> 01:08:03.166
<i>We have to finish at least fourth.</i>

904
01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:04.918
You're still in this race.

905
01:08:05.836 --> 01:08:07.087
<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

906
01:08:07.713 --> 01:08:08.589
<i>Focus.</i>

907
01:08:08.672 --> 01:08:10.299
<i>I know you can do this, Jann.</i>

908
01:08:37.033 --> 01:08:38.660
Capa and Schulin are up ahead.

909
01:08:40.412 --> 01:08:41.330
<i>You're gaining back.</i>

910
01:08:43.832 --> 01:08:46.835
{\an8}<i>He's threading the needle
between Capa and Schulin.</i>

911
01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.296
You back for more?

912
01:08:51.673 --> 01:08:52.841
Jack, what is he doing?!

913
01:08:55.469 --> 01:08:57.888
<i>Easy. Don't lose that line.
Don't lose that line.</i>

914
01:08:57.970 --> 01:08:59.348
Jack, they're boxing me in.

915
01:09:01.015 --> 01:09:03.100
Well, then do something about it.

916
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:08.314
{\an8}<i>Hits the brakes, goes down to third!</i>

917
01:09:08.398 --> 01:09:09.274
What the--?

918
01:09:17.366 --> 01:09:19.326
See you. Bye!

919
01:09:19.408 --> 01:09:21.203
That's what I'm talking about!

920
01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:23.663
Aw, shit!

921
01:09:27.209 --> 01:09:28.252
<i>Watch your six.</i>

922
01:09:34.174 --> 01:09:36.844
Oh, my God, he's gaining way
too much speed. What is he doing?

923
01:09:55.237 --> 01:09:58.365
Shit! Capa's tire just shattered
my windscreen.

924
01:09:58.448 --> 01:10:00.993
Okay, pit now. Pit. Yellow's out.

925
01:10:07.708 --> 01:10:08.709
Hey, you all right?

926
01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:14.464
-Can you see through this thing?
-Yeah.

927
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.136
Are you okay? Come this way, please.

928
01:10:19.219 --> 01:10:21.471
Let's get you checked. How do you feel?

929
01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:23.265
{\an8}<i>The safety team arriving...</i>

930
01:10:23.348 --> 01:10:27.060
{\an8}<i>It is all clear for Nick Capa.
He's absolutely furious.</i>

931
01:10:29.438 --> 01:10:31.023
Stay calm, all right?

932
01:10:33.150 --> 01:10:35.027
-Ready to go!
-All right. Green. Go!

933
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:41.575
Stay ahead of Schulin!

934
01:10:46.496 --> 01:10:50.083
<i>Racing once again.
And we're right into the final lap.</i>

935
01:10:50.167 --> 01:10:51.502
<i>You gotta hold Schulin off.</i>

936
01:10:51.585 --> 01:10:54.421
You're in fourth place,
but you gotta play defense.

937
01:11:04.014 --> 01:11:06.683
<i>Do not let him get under you
in these turns.</i>

938
01:11:12.564 --> 01:11:15.025
This is it. Last turn and final straight.

939
01:11:15.108 --> 01:11:16.652
-Drop the hammer!
-Roger that.

940
01:11:25.118 --> 01:11:27.579
{\an8}<i>Will the German get the better
of the young rookie?</i>

941
01:11:29.498 --> 01:11:31.208
<i>Watch that checkered flag!</i>

942
01:11:40.384 --> 01:11:42.135
-Yes!
-Yes!

943
01:11:42.219 --> 01:11:43.470
-Fuck!
-Yes!

944
01:11:43.554 --> 01:11:45.305
Whoa, fourth!

945
01:11:45.389 --> 01:11:47.516
<i>That's your FIA license, kid.</i>

946
01:11:47.599 --> 01:11:49.476
Yes! Yes!

947
01:11:51.603 --> 01:11:52.437
Yeah, baby!

948
01:11:57.526 --> 01:11:59.027
Dude, what is your problem?!

949
01:11:59.111 --> 01:12:00.863
It's part of the game. It's called racing.

950
01:12:00.946 --> 01:12:03.740
Are you for real? You almost killed me!
You almost killed me!

951
01:12:03.824 --> 01:12:07.578
Do that again and watch what happens.
Try that shit again. I'm serious.

952
01:12:07.661 --> 01:12:09.621
You almost killed me and yourself!

953
01:12:10.289 --> 01:12:11.540
I'm serious!

954
01:12:11.623 --> 01:12:14.751
Hey! Hey! You came in fourth!

955
01:12:15.878 --> 01:12:17.462
You came in fourth!

956
01:12:17.546 --> 01:12:20.132
-FIA license, baby!
-You got your license!

957
01:12:20.215 --> 01:12:23.719
You did it! You did it! Forget that guy.

958
01:12:24.261 --> 01:12:26.138
You broke your cherry!

959
01:12:26.221 --> 01:12:28.640
You got your license!

960
01:12:40.777 --> 01:12:41.612
Hey.

961
01:12:45.532 --> 01:12:46.783
Got you a beer.

962
01:12:47.618 --> 01:12:48.619
Thank you.

963
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:51.663
-So.
-Yes?

964
01:12:51.747 --> 01:12:55.792
You were pretty damn good today.

965
01:12:56.835 --> 01:12:59.796
-Don't sound so surprised.
-I am surprised.

966
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.840
I'm very surprised.

967
01:13:03.592 --> 01:13:06.887
You got instincts. That can't be taught.

968
01:13:07.721 --> 01:13:09.681
Did you feel it when you were out there?

969
01:13:10.849 --> 01:13:14.645
That thing where time slows down,

970
01:13:14.728 --> 01:13:17.356
and you feel like the car's on rails.

971
01:13:17.439 --> 01:13:19.691
You feel like you can't make a mistake.

972
01:13:19.775 --> 01:13:22.069
Feels like nothing and everything
at the same time.

973
01:13:27.616 --> 01:13:29.660
Jesus, I miss that so much.

974
01:13:29.743 --> 01:13:31.912
That's the only thing
I miss about being in the car.

975
01:13:31.995 --> 01:13:35.791
Now I only get it when I, you know, listen
to early Black Sabbath or something.

976
01:13:35.874 --> 01:13:38.001
Just, like, the bullshit fades away.

977
01:13:38.085 --> 01:13:40.003
That's what you're listening to
on this thing?

978
01:13:40.087 --> 01:13:41.922
-Black Sabbath?
-Yeah.

979
01:13:42.005 --> 01:13:44.967
You know, they make these
that hold more than eight songs.

980
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:47.094
I'm nostalgic, what do you want?

981
01:13:47.177 --> 01:13:51.348
Hey, what are you gonna do
with that big ol' signing bonus?

982
01:13:51.431 --> 01:13:52.266
I don't know.

983
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:55.811
I'll probably put it towards a flat.

984
01:13:56.562 --> 01:13:57.729
You're such a nerd.

985
01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:01.650
Why don't you take a bunch of it
and blow it on a first-class ticket

986
01:14:01.733 --> 01:14:05.529
for that girl you're obsessed with
and fly her out here

987
01:14:05.612 --> 01:14:07.781
to be there
for the signing event with you.

988
01:14:07.865 --> 01:14:08.866
I don't have a girl.

989
01:14:08.949 --> 01:14:11.493
You don't have a girl?
Who's the girl that you're looking at,

990
01:14:11.577 --> 01:14:14.496
like, hundreds of pictures
on your phone all day long?

991
01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:15.956
Who's that girl?

992
01:14:16.039 --> 01:14:17.457
-You rookie.
-Danny...

993
01:14:18.876 --> 01:14:21.170
Danny told me
you were an incredible driver.

994
01:14:22.087 --> 01:14:22.921
Yeah?

995
01:14:24.089 --> 01:14:26.675
Yeah. What was your favorite track?

996
01:14:26.758 --> 01:14:28.135
Le Mans. Hands down.

997
01:14:28.218 --> 01:14:29.845
-Really?
-Yes.

998
01:14:29.928 --> 01:14:31.972
-Why?
-It's a perfect track.

999
01:14:32.598 --> 01:14:34.141
Nowhere tests you like that.

1000
01:14:34.808 --> 01:14:37.769
You podium at Le Mans
and you live forever.

1001
01:14:37.853 --> 01:14:40.147
-You become immortal.
-Did you?

1002
01:14:40.772 --> 01:14:44.109
No. I did not. I am still mortal.

1003
01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:46.695
But I did race it. Once.

1004
01:14:46.778 --> 01:14:47.905
What happened?

1005
01:14:47.988 --> 01:14:49.573
You're the racer from today, right?

1006
01:14:49.656 --> 01:14:51.200
Can we get your autograph?

1007
01:14:55.287 --> 01:14:56.288
Yeah, sure.

1008
01:14:56.997 --> 01:14:59.666
-You were amazing, by the way.
-Thank you so much.

1009
01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:01.251
Can I get a selfie as well?

1010
01:15:01.335 --> 01:15:02.669
-For sure.
-Thanks.

1011
01:15:17.809 --> 01:15:19.895
Jann. This is a surprise.

1012
01:15:19.978 --> 01:15:22.481
<i>You know, I was just watching
your story on Insta.</i>

1013
01:15:22.564 --> 01:15:23.565
Oh, really?

1014
01:15:24.399 --> 01:15:25.442
Well, that's crazy.

1015
01:15:25.526 --> 01:15:28.111
<i>I was wondering how many times
I'd have to like them</i>

1016
01:15:28.195 --> 01:15:29.446
before you'd call me.

1017
01:15:30.072 --> 01:15:33.075
Fifty, sixty times?

1018
01:15:33.158 --> 01:15:37.788
Yeah, sorry.
I should have called sooner, but--

1019
01:15:37.871 --> 01:15:40.499
It's okay. You've been busy.

1020
01:15:40.582 --> 01:15:43.001
I was thinking about
that night that you left and...

1021
01:15:43.085 --> 01:15:44.127
Yeah?

1022
01:15:44.211 --> 01:15:46.505
I wish we'd got more time, you know?

1023
01:15:46.588 --> 01:15:48.966
Jann, we have all the time in the world.

1024
01:15:49.925 --> 01:15:51.260
Where do you wanna go?

1025
01:16:24.877 --> 01:16:26.003
How is everybody?

1026
01:16:31.175 --> 01:16:33.552
It's an absolute honor to meet you, sir.

1027
01:16:35.304 --> 01:16:40.893
It took me a decade to prove
that <i>Gran Turismo</i> could work.

1028
01:16:40.976 --> 01:16:45.480
This young man has proven it
in just one year.

1029
01:16:45.564 --> 01:16:46.690
Jann.

1030
01:16:46.773 --> 01:16:49.193
By signing this contract

1031
01:16:49.276 --> 01:16:51.111
as a professional driver,

1032
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:54.573
you're showing not only gamers...

1033
01:16:55.532 --> 01:16:58.076
but any kid who had a dream...

1034
01:16:58.744 --> 01:17:00.329
that anything is possible.

1035
01:17:00.412 --> 01:17:02.706
Welcome to Team Nissan.

1036
01:17:07.336 --> 01:17:08.212
This way!

1037
01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:12.466
-Jann-san. This way, please.
-Jann-san, please! Look this way.

1038
01:17:13.884 --> 01:17:16.303
Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you.

1039
01:17:16.887 --> 01:17:18.138
-Hey.
-Hey.

1040
01:17:18.722 --> 01:17:19.806
Hey.

1041
01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:20.933
Man of the hour.

1042
01:17:21.016 --> 01:17:23.602
-Yeah, you came.
-Thanks for bringing me here.

1043
01:17:23.685 --> 01:17:27.189
Do you have any time to enjoy Tokyo?
And what sights would you like to see?

1044
01:17:27.814 --> 01:17:30.400
Yeah, I would like to see more of Tokyo.
I would love to.

1045
01:17:30.484 --> 01:17:34.238
Guys, thank you so much. I think we've had
more than enough questions for now.

1046
01:17:34.321 --> 01:17:37.407
Now get out while you can, guys, go.

1047
01:17:37.908 --> 01:17:40.077
Quick, make a run for it. Enjoy the city.

1048
01:17:47.251 --> 01:17:49.461
<i>You and me dreamed of this in Wales,
and now...</i>

1049
01:17:50.587 --> 01:17:51.588
<i>it's real.</i>

1050
01:17:52.506 --> 01:17:53.590
We manifested this.

1051
01:17:57.803 --> 01:17:58.971
Yeah, maybe we did.

1052
01:18:07.271 --> 01:18:08.564
Oh, cool.

1053
01:18:10.566 --> 01:18:11.984
What are you looking at?

1054
01:18:12.776 --> 01:18:14.945
Might buy a gift for a friend.

1055
01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.197
<i>Sake?</i>

1056
01:18:18.031 --> 01:18:19.032
After you.

1057
01:18:19.116 --> 01:18:21.618
Or we could order something else.

1058
01:18:21.702 --> 01:18:22.703
What is there?

1059
01:18:22.786 --> 01:18:24.872
Champagne, maybe?
Celebrate your big signing?

1060
01:18:24.955 --> 01:18:26.206
Champagne's for the podium.

1061
01:18:26.748 --> 01:18:28.000
-Oh, okay.
-Sorry.

1062
01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:29.751
Noted, Mr. Big Shot.

1063
01:18:29.835 --> 01:18:31.086
Thank you so much.

1064
01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:32.254
Thank you.

1065
01:18:36.842 --> 01:18:38.302
That's amazing.

1066
01:18:40.137 --> 01:18:42.806
Man, that is amazing. That is so good.

1067
01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:44.516
More, more, more.

1068
01:19:41.865 --> 01:19:45.202
<i>Most challenging circuit in the world.
So hard to remember.</i>

1069
01:19:45.285 --> 01:19:48.914
<i>It is the most feared circuit
on planet Earth.</i>

1070
01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:52.751
<i>It is, of course,
the Nürburgring Nordschleife.</i>

1071
01:20:07.015 --> 01:20:09.560
Why don't you check out
those numbers over there, all right?

1072
01:20:22.281 --> 01:20:23.115
Hey.

1073
01:20:24.449 --> 01:20:25.284
Hey.

1074
01:20:26.994 --> 01:20:27.995
It's time.

1075
01:20:30.414 --> 01:20:31.540
Yeah.

1076
01:20:32.708 --> 01:20:33.542
You okay?

1077
01:20:35.085 --> 01:20:35.919
Yeah.

1078
01:20:37.087 --> 01:20:37.921
Here.

1079
01:20:40.215 --> 01:20:41.550
What is this, my birthday?

1080
01:20:42.092 --> 01:20:44.970
It's just, I don't know, something I saw.

1081
01:20:45.888 --> 01:20:46.722
Open it later.

1082
01:21:08.035 --> 01:21:09.536
Have a good one, mate.

1083
01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:12.039
<i>It's been an impressive start
to the season</i>

1084
01:21:12.122 --> 01:21:14.625
<i>for the young lad from Wales,
Jann Mardenborough,</i>

1085
01:21:14.708 --> 01:21:19.129
<i>who just a month ago
placed fourth at Dubai Autodrome.</i>

1086
01:21:19.796 --> 01:21:21.048
He looks so young.

1087
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:24.510
{\an8}<i>Yeah, the Nordschleife is
the most challenging circuit</i>

1088
01:21:24.593 --> 01:21:27.679
{\an8}<i>and it's gonna be the biggest challenge
of Jann's career so far.</i>

1089
01:21:37.814 --> 01:21:38.982
All clear. Drop the car.

1090
01:21:42.361 --> 01:21:43.445
You hear me in there?

1091
01:21:44.947 --> 01:21:46.323
Loud and clear.

1092
01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.216
<i>Looking good, Jann. Smooth is fast.</i>

1093
01:22:04.299 --> 01:22:05.676
<i>Smooth is fast.</i>

1094
01:22:09.888 --> 01:22:11.515
<i>Very nice! Schulin down.</i>

1095
01:22:11.598 --> 01:22:14.935
{\an8}<i>Showing fantastic pace
from Jann Mardenborough</i>

1096
01:22:15.018 --> 01:22:17.312
{\an8}<i>as he's working his way up
through the field.</i>

1097
01:22:29.616 --> 01:22:31.618
Pit for fuel when you come around.

1098
01:22:32.244 --> 01:22:33.161
Copy.

1099
01:23:01.648 --> 01:23:03.066
What the hell?

1100
01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:05.235
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

1101
01:23:30.677 --> 01:23:31.929
Was that his car?

1102
01:23:49.196 --> 01:23:50.781
Oh, no!

1103
01:23:50.864 --> 01:23:53.200
<i>That is a terrifying accident
for Jann Mardenborough,</i>

1104
01:23:53.283 --> 01:23:55.827
<i>and all we can do at this moment
is hope he's okay.</i>

1105
01:23:55.911 --> 01:23:58.288
<i>We aren't sure of his condition.
May be still in the car.</i>

1106
01:23:58.372 --> 01:24:01.375
<i>But we hope
that he and the spectators are okay.</i>

1107
01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:02.960
<i>It's a horrible accident.</i>

1108
01:24:28.443 --> 01:24:29.903
Hey, wait!

1109
01:24:29.987 --> 01:24:31.363
Stop, stop!

1110
01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:38.620
Oh, no. Oh, Jann.

1111
01:24:39.413 --> 01:24:41.248
My baby.

1112
01:25:45.812 --> 01:25:47.606
I don't know how we're gonna
explain this to Nissan.

1113
01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:48.815
There's got to be an investigation.

1114
01:25:48.899 --> 01:25:50.526
That's what
you're thinking about right now?

1115
01:25:53.403 --> 01:25:54.863
They could shut us down over this.

1116
01:25:54.947 --> 01:25:57.783
-Okay. Somebody died.
-I understand.

1117
01:26:02.287 --> 01:26:03.121
Hey.

1118
01:26:06.208 --> 01:26:07.376
No, whoa, whoa.

1119
01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:10.504
Hey. Come on.
You need to rest, you need to rest.

1120
01:26:10.587 --> 01:26:11.588
I'm okay.

1121
01:26:19.805 --> 01:26:20.889
What happened?

1122
01:26:22.099 --> 01:26:24.268
It's not your fault, okay?

1123
01:26:27.271 --> 01:26:28.730
It was a freak accident.

1124
01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:33.026
Was someone hurt?

1125
01:26:34.945 --> 01:26:35.946
A spectator.

1126
01:26:36.029 --> 01:26:37.322
Did they die?

1127
01:26:44.997 --> 01:26:47.958
It was an accident.
It is certainly not on you.

1128
01:26:48.584 --> 01:26:49.585
It is on me.

1129
01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:52.754
I should've pitted you sooner.

1130
01:26:52.838 --> 01:26:54.298
-Oh, my God.
-Hey.

1131
01:26:55.632 --> 01:26:57.926
You know why they call
that section <i>Flugplatz?</i>

1132
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:59.344
It means "airfield."

1133
01:27:00.095 --> 01:27:01.805
Cars lift off there.

1134
01:27:01.889 --> 01:27:05.184
With that headwind, it was like a sail.
It was a freak accident, Jann.

1135
01:27:06.435 --> 01:27:07.603
Come on.

1136
01:27:07.686 --> 01:27:09.688
I shouldn't have been there.

1137
01:27:09.771 --> 01:27:12.691
Someone's dead
because racing is dangerous.

1138
01:27:12.774 --> 01:27:16.195
-I was driving.
-Jann, you can't be blamed for this.

1139
01:27:16.278 --> 01:27:18.947
Can you go? Can you go? I'm done.

1140
01:27:19.031 --> 01:27:20.574
Jann, listen to me, okay?

1141
01:27:20.657 --> 01:27:21.992
Get out!

1142
01:28:02.032 --> 01:28:05.786
I'd like to start
by saying everybody at Nissan

1143
01:28:06.662 --> 01:28:09.957
would like to extend their deepest
condolences to the family of the deceased.

1144
01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:13.418
<i>This was a tragic accident,</i>

1145
01:28:14.253 --> 01:28:15.963
<i>and our hearts go out to them.</i>

1146
01:28:16.797 --> 01:28:18.257
<i>Do you want me to come down there?</i>

1147
01:28:20.259 --> 01:28:21.260
<i>I can.</i>

1148
01:28:23.887 --> 01:28:26.890
That's okay.
I'm not much fun at the moment.

1149
01:28:27.975 --> 01:28:30.060
What about your family?
Have you spoken to them?

1150
01:28:40.571 --> 01:28:44.157
<i>We are, of course,
cooperating with the investigation,</i>

1151
01:28:44.241 --> 01:28:47.536
{\an8}<i>and we will provide racing officials
and the DMSB</i>

1152
01:28:47.619 --> 01:28:51.248
<i>with any information that would help
prevent this from happening again.</i>

1153
01:28:51.331 --> 01:28:53.041
He should have never been on that track.

1154
01:28:56.628 --> 01:28:58.422
And you should have stayed
where you belong.

1155
01:28:58.505 --> 01:28:59.506
Under the hood.

1156
01:29:21.904 --> 01:29:25.365
<i>The hospital said
you were discharged with no injuries.</i>

1157
01:29:25.449 --> 01:29:27.367
<i>Please let us come and see you.</i>

1158
01:29:29.119 --> 01:29:31.121
I'm not sure if I can do this.

1159
01:29:31.747 --> 01:29:34.291
<i>But, sweetheart,
you know it wasn't your fault, right?</i>

1160
01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:37.044
<i>This could've happened to anybody.</i>

1161
01:29:37.586 --> 01:29:39.296
Yeah, but it happened to me.

1162
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:44.301
<i>Do you wanna speak to your dad? Or Coby?</i>

1163
01:29:45.385 --> 01:29:47.888
What, so they can just say
they were right?

1164
01:29:47.971 --> 01:29:50.349
<i>He just wants to know you're okay.</i>

1165
01:29:51.391 --> 01:29:53.602
<i>So do I, my baby.</i>

1166
01:30:35.602 --> 01:30:36.603
Let's go.

1167
01:31:20.063 --> 01:31:21.940
You had asked me
what happened at Le Mans.

1168
01:31:25.777 --> 01:31:27.070
I was in a wreck.

1169
01:31:56.683 --> 01:31:58.310
It was a beautiful day.

1170
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:02.648
It was getting late in that first day,

1171
01:32:02.731 --> 01:32:05.817
and I was coming out
of the Tertre Rouge corner.

1172
01:32:06.527 --> 01:32:08.070
I was coming up on a Ford.

1173
01:32:08.153 --> 01:32:10.906
As I passed him, I saw his car twitch.

1174
01:32:11.490 --> 01:32:12.950
It was like a shiver.

1175
01:32:15.911 --> 01:32:17.704
And then he lost control.

1176
01:32:20.249 --> 01:32:23.085
Car flipped three times
before it hit the barrier.

1177
01:32:23.836 --> 01:32:26.380
Caught on fire like that.
Medics came, pulled me out.

1178
01:32:26.463 --> 01:32:29.091
My gloves were on fire,
but everything else...

1179
01:32:29.174 --> 01:32:30.175
not a scratch.

1180
01:32:30.843 --> 01:32:33.554
But that Ford was in a thousand pieces.

1181
01:32:34.304 --> 01:32:37.099
Tony, the driver,
he died on the way to the hospital.

1182
01:32:39.017 --> 01:32:42.187
They said it wasn't my fault.

1183
01:32:43.897 --> 01:32:46.650
I never got behind the wheel
of a race car ever again.

1184
01:32:49.152 --> 01:32:50.571
I lost my nerve.

1185
01:32:52.447 --> 01:32:56.243
More than that, I lost the chance
to find out how good I could have been.

1186
01:32:59.538 --> 01:33:00.539
I quit.

1187
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:05.252
I've had to live with that...

1188
01:33:06.503 --> 01:33:07.588
my whole life.

1189
01:33:12.342 --> 01:33:13.802
You wanna walk away...

1190
01:33:15.762 --> 01:33:17.264
nobody would blame you.

1191
01:33:17.347 --> 01:33:18.849
Most people would.

1192
01:33:20.225 --> 01:33:22.311
I got a feeling you're not most people.

1193
01:33:25.022 --> 01:33:28.233
I think you could be the best.

1194
01:33:29.067 --> 01:33:31.528
But if you wanna prove it,
if you wanna be a driver,

1195
01:33:32.154 --> 01:33:34.406
then you gotta get back on that track
and you gotta do it right now.

1196
01:33:34.489 --> 01:33:37.075
Because if you don't, you never will.

1197
01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:41.163
That crash is not gonna define
who you are.

1198
01:33:42.206 --> 01:33:44.166
But how you respond to it...

1199
01:33:45.167 --> 01:33:46.168
will.

1200
01:33:51.924 --> 01:33:53.091
Finish your lap.

1201
01:35:06.248 --> 01:35:07.916
All right, nice and easy.

1202
01:35:08.625 --> 01:35:10.586
-Just hold the line.
-Okay.

1203
01:35:28.854 --> 01:35:31.607
Give it a little speed.
Let's have some fun.

1204
01:35:47.998 --> 01:35:49.041
You're okay.

1205
01:35:55.005 --> 01:35:56.006
What's next?

1206
01:36:13.565 --> 01:36:17.361
The racing commission has finally
come to their decision.

1207
01:36:17.444 --> 01:36:19.655
Good news is they've cleared you.

1208
01:36:20.822 --> 01:36:23.033
Yeah, it's great news.
What's the bad news?

1209
01:36:23.951 --> 01:36:25.452
You looked at your phone lately?

1210
01:36:25.536 --> 01:36:26.787
No.

1211
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:29.498
Capa and some of the other boys
have taken to Twitter

1212
01:36:29.581 --> 01:36:31.834
to demand we have our license revoked.

1213
01:36:32.793 --> 01:36:37.339
They even started
an anti-SIM driver campaign.

1214
01:36:37.422 --> 01:36:40.384
Several of the other teams have jumped
on the bandwagon

1215
01:36:40.467 --> 01:36:45.055
and are independently
launching cases against us.

1216
01:36:45.138 --> 01:36:46.765
Gotta be kidding me.

1217
01:36:46.849 --> 01:36:48.475
Could that work?

1218
01:36:48.559 --> 01:36:53.021
Let's face it, it doesn't make it easy
for our sponsor to keep carrying us.

1219
01:36:53.105 --> 01:36:56.483
Nissan is considering shutting us down.

1220
01:36:58.485 --> 01:36:59.319
So...

1221
01:37:04.157 --> 01:37:08.579
We gotta prove to them, we gotta prove
to everyone, that we belong.

1222
01:37:09.246 --> 01:37:10.247
How?

1223
01:37:11.039 --> 01:37:16.378
By placing on the podium at Le Mans
with a team of SIM drivers.

1224
01:37:16.461 --> 01:37:18.422
I'm sorry. You're serious?

1225
01:37:18.505 --> 01:37:19.965
Le Mans. You...

1226
01:37:20.799 --> 01:37:23.302
-Podium at Le Mans.
-Yeah.

1227
01:37:24.678 --> 01:37:27.389
I mean, first thing is,
we'd need two other drivers.

1228
01:37:27.472 --> 01:37:29.892
Matty and Antonio, they've both
been racing the lower circuits

1229
01:37:29.975 --> 01:37:32.352
since GT Academy.
I mean, they can do it.

1230
01:37:33.228 --> 01:37:34.479
I believe in you, Jann.

1231
01:37:34.563 --> 01:37:37.274
You've driven this
a thousand times before in the game.

1232
01:37:37.357 --> 01:37:39.026
You can do this in your sleep.

1233
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:41.361
You've done some amazing things, kid.

1234
01:37:42.905 --> 01:37:44.364
But Le Mans is...

1235
01:37:44.448 --> 01:37:45.866
It's a different animal.

1236
01:37:47.326 --> 01:37:48.660
It's the most physically demanding,

1237
01:37:48.744 --> 01:37:51.079
technically challenging race
in the entire world.

1238
01:37:53.165 --> 01:37:54.416
It's dangerous.

1239
01:37:55.334 --> 01:37:56.752
It tests you.

1240
01:37:59.213 --> 01:38:00.506
I couldn't do it.

1241
01:38:02.341 --> 01:38:03.884
But I know that you can.

1242
01:38:05.802 --> 01:38:07.304
Do you know that you can?

1243
01:38:13.477 --> 01:38:15.229
Let's be immortal.

1244
01:38:20.317 --> 01:38:21.652
We in?

1245
01:38:34.957 --> 01:38:38.210
Are you ready for it, Jann?
It's the big time, baby.

1246
01:38:40.254 --> 01:38:41.964
-Yo.
-How's it going?

1247
01:38:47.594 --> 01:38:48.679
Been watching the tour.

1248
01:38:49.429 --> 01:38:50.639
You look good, Stretch.

1249
01:38:51.139 --> 01:38:53.767
I don't feel so bad
for losing to you anymore.

1250
01:38:53.851 --> 01:38:55.310
Hey, man, look.

1251
01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.106
That wreck? It wasn't your fault.

1252
01:38:59.189 --> 01:39:00.357
We got your back.

1253
01:39:01.358 --> 01:39:02.609
I appreciate that.

1254
01:39:04.319 --> 01:39:05.529
-Thank you, man.
-Yeah, bro.

1255
01:39:05.612 --> 01:39:08.073
-Hey, guys.
-Are you boys ready for this?

1256
01:39:13.912 --> 01:39:15.247
This car...

1257
01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:20.502
it's a lot lighter, a lot faster
than the GT-Rs you've been driving.

1258
01:39:22.171 --> 01:39:24.381
It's quicker in the corners,

1259
01:39:25.090 --> 01:39:27.426
it requires more finesse, all right?

1260
01:39:28.135 --> 01:39:31.263
You gotta get the feel
or you'll lock up, you'll spin out.

1261
01:39:32.055 --> 01:39:34.850
Ah, whatever. You're gonna be fine.

1262
01:39:58.498 --> 01:40:02.836
<i>With millions tuning in,
it's the 24 Hours of Le Mans,</i>

1263
01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:05.297
<i>the greatest race in the world.</i>

1264
01:40:07.132 --> 01:40:09.384
Are you ready? I'm excited.

1265
01:40:09.468 --> 01:40:11.970
Good to see you, sir. How are you?

1266
01:40:35.202 --> 01:40:36.203
Ready.

1267
01:40:57.432 --> 01:40:58.475
Noobie.

1268
01:41:01.728 --> 01:41:03.063
Thank you for coming.

1269
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:14.032
I...

1270
01:41:24.668 --> 01:41:26.628
I didn't support you properly.

1271
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:39.892
I was trying to protect you. You know?

1272
01:41:40.726 --> 01:41:43.312
So many fathers, so many parents...

1273
01:41:46.148 --> 01:41:49.651
they have these kids
with these big, crazy dreams, you know?

1274
01:41:53.655 --> 01:41:57.326
And that damn PlayStation thing,
I just don't understand that shit, Jann.

1275
01:41:57.409 --> 01:41:58.410
I mean...

1276
01:42:01.330 --> 01:42:02.164
But, hey,

1277
01:42:03.415 --> 01:42:04.625
you did this.

1278
01:42:08.754 --> 01:42:10.881
I'm so goddamn proud of you.

1279
01:42:12.466 --> 01:42:14.051
I did this for you.

1280
01:42:24.061 --> 01:42:25.646
I'm proud of you.

1281
01:42:38.825 --> 01:42:40.577
I've got your back, my boy.

1282
01:42:43.872 --> 01:42:47.209
<i>Just to go over it again,
it's a 24-hour race.</i>

1283
01:42:47.292 --> 01:42:49.586
<i>We start at 3 in the afternoon, daytime.</i>

1284
01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:52.172
<i>We race all night into the next day.</i>

1285
01:42:52.256 --> 01:42:54.007
<i>Race ends at 3.</i>

1286
01:42:54.675 --> 01:42:57.553
We start with three-hour shifts
instead of the normal four.

1287
01:42:57.636 --> 01:42:58.804
Three, six, nine.

1288
01:42:58.887 --> 01:43:01.139
No driver in Le Mans can race
more than 14 hours.

1289
01:43:01.223 --> 01:43:02.432
I just wanna say something.

1290
01:43:02.516 --> 01:43:06.186
When he came to me and said
he was gonna start this GT Academy,

1291
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:10.190
I thought all of you were completely nuts.

1292
01:43:14.027 --> 01:43:15.654
But you made me a believer.

1293
01:43:20.909 --> 01:43:22.119
Let's go show the world.

1294
01:43:27.082 --> 01:43:29.459
-These guys were in the Academy with Jann.
-Right. Hi.

1295
01:43:29.543 --> 01:43:31.461
-Hey, guys. This is Audrey.
-Hey.

1296
01:43:31.545 --> 01:43:33.172
-Hi!
-Hey.

1297
01:43:33.255 --> 01:43:35.883
-Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Leah.
-Audrey.

1298
01:43:56.445 --> 01:44:01.450
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please rise
for the French national anthem.</i>

1299
01:44:19.343 --> 01:44:21.345
<i>The French army has just arrived</i>

1300
01:44:21.428 --> 01:44:26.725
<i>to deliver the flag which will be used
to give the start of the Le Mans 24 Hours.</i>

1301
01:45:11.311 --> 01:45:14.231
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines.</i>

1302
01:45:14.815 --> 01:45:15.649
Let's go.

1303
01:45:16.692 --> 01:45:19.653
<i>One of the world's most iconic races,
the Le Mans 24,</i>

1304
01:45:19.736 --> 01:45:23.240
<i>stands just moments away
at the Circuit de la Sarthe.</i>

1305
01:45:23.323 --> 01:45:26.493
<i>And, Chenny, so many great stories
the length and breadth of this field,</i>

1306
01:45:26.577 --> 01:45:29.204
<i>but for me the one that's taking
my focus right now</i>

1307
01:45:29.288 --> 01:45:31.415
<i>is the incredible story at Nissan.</i>

1308
01:45:31.498 --> 01:45:35.586
<i>Is the last chance the SIM racers get
in professional motorsport?</i>

1309
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:37.254
<i>There's an awful lot of pressure
on their shoulders.</i>

1310
01:45:37.337 --> 01:45:40.048
Nobody wins this thing
on the first lap, okay?

1311
01:45:41.258 --> 01:45:45.053
You make your day, survive the night,
you live to fight tomorrow.

1312
01:45:48.891 --> 01:45:49.892
Good luck.

1313
01:46:40.692 --> 01:46:43.487
<i>As the cars now leave the grid
for the formation lap</i>

1314
01:46:43.570 --> 01:46:45.656
<i>here at the Circuit de la Sarthe,</i>

1315
01:46:45.739 --> 01:46:49.284
<i>we are just moments away
from the start of this iconic race.</i>

1316
01:47:11.265 --> 01:47:14.810
<i>We're underway already and, listen,
you've gotta be smart going into turn one.</i>

1317
01:47:14.893 --> 01:47:17.437
<i>The tires are still cold.
Contact! Contact in the back!</i>

1318
01:47:17.521 --> 01:47:19.356
<i>We've seen the BMW and the Aston Martin--</i>

1319
01:47:35.497 --> 01:47:38.083
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

1320
01:47:38.166 --> 01:47:40.127
Mulsanne Straight.

1321
01:47:40.210 --> 01:47:43.463
<i>You could hit a high of 340 kph here.</i>

1322
01:47:43.547 --> 01:47:46.008
<i>You gotta build in enough time
to brake before chicane one.</i>

1323
01:47:46.091 --> 01:47:49.219
Yes, yes. Okay.
I've done this a thousand times.

1324
01:47:49.303 --> 01:47:51.054
<i>Well, not in reality.</i>

1325
01:47:51.138 --> 01:47:52.639
Watch your speed.

1326
01:47:59.771 --> 01:48:02.149
<i>Into the first chicane,
around the outside,</i>

1327
01:48:02.232 --> 01:48:05.068
<i>and it's a lovely move put on there
by Jann Mardenborough.</i>

1328
01:48:05.903 --> 01:48:08.947
<i>Watch those GT3s.
You're way faster than them.</i>

1329
01:48:13.744 --> 01:48:15.037
I see Schulin.

1330
01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:16.997
<i>Come on, Jann! Stay on him!</i>

1331
01:48:21.251 --> 01:48:23.962
<i>On your left!
Ferrari's too slow. Watch out!</i>

1332
01:48:24.046 --> 01:48:24.963
No, no, no. No!

1333
01:48:27.090 --> 01:48:30.385
<i>He gets tapped by the Ferrari!
Schulin up in the air!</i>

1334
01:48:37.976 --> 01:48:39.186
Is he okay?!

1335
01:48:55.619 --> 01:48:58.288
{\an8}What's he saying? Was it Jann?

1336
01:49:02.084 --> 01:49:05.003
<i>Schulin! Get out, get out, get out!</i>

1337
01:49:06.755 --> 01:49:08.924
<i>Schulin climbs out of the car.</i>

1338
01:49:09.007 --> 01:49:11.760
<i>Making his way out, and that's good
to see from the fire marshals.</i>

1339
01:49:12.636 --> 01:49:14.513
<i>Safety car's out on the track.</i>

1340
01:49:20.227 --> 01:49:21.436
<i>Stay focused.</i>

1341
01:49:22.312 --> 01:49:25.440
All right, they're pulling him out.
He seems all right. He seems all right.

1342
01:49:26.275 --> 01:49:29.236
<i>After that impact,
it's a miracle the car is in one piece</i>

1343
01:49:29.319 --> 01:49:30.988
<i>and the driver could walk away.</i>

1344
01:49:33.991 --> 01:49:35.701
Get behind that safety car.

1345
01:49:43.125 --> 01:49:45.127
<i>Okay, keep your head in, all right? Focus.</i>

1346
01:49:52.885 --> 01:49:56.638
<i>All right, safety's out, race back on.
Let's go, let's go!</i>

1347
01:49:56.722 --> 01:49:57.723
<i>Come on!</i>

1348
01:50:01.768 --> 01:50:02.978
Come on, you hear me?

1349
01:50:05.314 --> 01:50:08.317
<i>Hey, buddy? Hey. Hey, Jann?</i>

1350
01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:11.153
Hey, stay with me.
Stay with me, okay? Stay with me.

1351
01:50:12.446 --> 01:50:15.532
<i>Look, safety's left, okay?
We gotta make up some time.</i>

1352
01:50:16.283 --> 01:50:17.117
<i>Jann.</i>

1353
01:50:19.119 --> 01:50:20.913
Jann, talk to me, pal.

1354
01:50:20.996 --> 01:50:22.581
Jann. Hey, hey, hey.

1355
01:50:22.664 --> 01:50:24.041
Hey, Jann.

1356
01:50:24.124 --> 01:50:26.793
<i>Is it a car problem
or is it a head issue, Will?</i>

1357
01:50:26.877 --> 01:50:30.005
<i>It would be early for anything
to be wrong with that car,</i>

1358
01:50:30.088 --> 01:50:31.423
<i>which has shown good pace.</i>

1359
01:50:37.262 --> 01:50:38.305
Bitch.

1360
01:50:39.473 --> 01:50:40.891
Shit.

1361
01:50:40.974 --> 01:50:42.017
<i>Jack!</i>

1362
01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:43.727
We need to bring him in.

1363
01:50:45.771 --> 01:50:47.147
Then do something.

1364
01:50:47.231 --> 01:50:49.566
Just get his head back in this game.

1365
01:51:07.543 --> 01:51:08.377
Dude.

1366
01:51:09.378 --> 01:51:11.380
Dude, what the hell? Turn it off.

1367
01:51:15.926 --> 01:51:17.219
Turn it off!

1368
01:51:17.302 --> 01:51:19.096
<i>Now! Turn it off!</i>

1369
01:51:19.847 --> 01:51:23.100
Okay, let me just--
Oh, God, I don't know how to--

1370
01:51:23.183 --> 01:51:25.310
I told you,
I don't how to work these things.

1371
01:51:26.061 --> 01:51:29.147
<i>Shit, Jack, turn it off now!</i>

1372
01:51:30.482 --> 01:51:31.692
Shit.

1373
01:51:32.401 --> 01:51:33.610
Off.

1374
01:51:40.576 --> 01:51:41.577
You mad, bro?

1375
01:51:42.119 --> 01:51:43.662
Fucking yes!

1376
01:51:43.745 --> 01:51:45.414
Yes, I'm mad!

1377
01:51:45.497 --> 01:51:46.832
Yeah!

1378
01:51:46.915 --> 01:51:49.668
Well, get mad! It's about time!

1379
01:51:49.751 --> 01:51:52.212
Come on! Get in the fight!

1380
01:51:52.296 --> 01:51:54.131
I know you're scared.

1381
01:51:54.798 --> 01:51:56.341
I've been scared.

1382
01:51:57.050 --> 01:52:00.387
Whether you like it or not,
you are in this race.

1383
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:04.349
So you take all that Kenny G anger
and you unleash it!

1384
01:52:04.433 --> 01:52:05.976
<i>You hear me?</i>

1385
01:52:06.059 --> 01:52:07.269
Yes, sir.

1386
01:52:07.352 --> 01:52:09.313
<i>All right.</i>

1387
01:52:09.396 --> 01:52:10.397
<i>Go get 'em!</i>

1388
01:52:22.534 --> 01:52:24.953
<i>It's like he suddenly remembered
he was a racing driver.</i>

1389
01:52:25.037 --> 01:52:29.917
<i>Absolutely phenomenal display
by the debutante here in that Nissan.</i>

1390
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.793
All right, all right.

1391
01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:39.468
All right, coming up on Lotus.
Three seconds ahead.

1392
01:52:42.054 --> 01:52:43.639
<i>Let's make up some ground.</i>

1393
01:52:44.139 --> 01:52:45.724
<i>You have the same power on the straight,</i>

1394
01:52:45.807 --> 01:52:48.435
but if you get in the corner,
you'll be able to pass him, all right?

1395
01:52:49.019 --> 01:52:51.063
Okay, copy. Let me concentrate, old man.

1396
01:52:51.146 --> 01:52:52.731
Yeah, all right. Roger that. Copy.

1397
01:53:10.374 --> 01:53:12.709
Yes! Yes!

1398
01:53:12.793 --> 01:53:16.588
<i>Beautiful stuff from Jann Mardenborough
and from this Nissan team.</i>

1399
01:53:19.967 --> 01:53:21.051
Yes!

1400
01:53:21.718 --> 01:53:22.803
All right.

1401
01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:26.223
Now we only got 150 laps to go.

1402
01:53:26.932 --> 01:53:31.019
<i>He pulled that first stint back,
and Jann Mardenborough into the pits</i>

1403
01:53:31.103 --> 01:53:33.188
<i>for the first driver change for Nissan.</i>

1404
01:53:33.272 --> 01:53:35.148
Fast out there, man. Let's go, Matty!

1405
01:53:35.232 --> 01:53:36.733
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1406
01:53:41.822 --> 01:53:42.990
Adiós!

1407
01:53:44.074 --> 01:53:46.618
<i>As the sun goes down,
it's a whole new ballgame.</i>

1408
01:53:48.745 --> 01:53:49.913
Don't rush it.

1409
01:53:49.997 --> 01:53:51.748
<i>I'm gonna take the inside line, Jack.</i>

1410
01:53:54.251 --> 01:53:55.669
-Yeah! Yes!
-Yo, son!

1411
01:53:55.752 --> 01:53:56.670
Yes!

1412
01:53:56.753 --> 01:53:59.214
-Maybe you boys can actually drive.
-You know we can drive.

1413
01:53:59.298 --> 01:54:00.924
<i>Oh, yeah, jury's still out.</i>

1414
01:54:08.891 --> 01:54:09.892
<i>You're in P-9.</i>

1415
01:54:13.645 --> 01:54:17.232
Get tires ready. Here we go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1416
01:54:19.234 --> 01:54:20.986
<i>All leaders are on full wets.</i>

1417
01:54:35.042 --> 01:54:36.793
<i>Jann's doing great, isn't he?</i>

1418
01:54:36.877 --> 01:54:39.505
-Do you think so?
-You joking? Mate, he's razing it!

1419
01:54:39.588 --> 01:54:41.048
I can't believe it. He's doing amazing.

1420
01:54:42.174 --> 01:54:44.885
Nice and softly, nice and smooth.

1421
01:55:38.856 --> 01:55:39.898
<i>Hey, boys!</i>

1422
01:55:39.982 --> 01:55:41.692
-How are you boys doing?
-Hey, man.

1423
01:55:41.775 --> 01:55:43.861
-Jann, how you feeling?
-I feel good.

1424
01:55:43.944 --> 01:55:45.195
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1425
01:55:46.071 --> 01:55:47.072
Rest up.

1426
01:56:00.419 --> 01:56:05.215
<i>First light at Circuit de la Sarthe
at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

1427
01:56:05.299 --> 01:56:06.758
Here you are, Audrey. Got you a coffee.

1428
01:56:06.842 --> 01:56:08.135
-Thanks.
-No worries.

1429
01:56:08.886 --> 01:56:10.137
How's it looking?

1430
01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:13.849
In fourth, but Antonio is losing ground.

1431
01:56:13.932 --> 01:56:15.267
Not a lot of time left.

1432
01:56:15.809 --> 01:56:18.353
<i>Yeah,
Antonio Cruz clearly struggling there.</i>

1433
01:56:27.446 --> 01:56:28.864
-Hey.
-Hey.

1434
01:56:28.947 --> 01:56:31.658
Antonio's cramping up.
We're gonna pit him early.

1435
01:56:32.659 --> 01:56:34.077
You ready to bring this home?

1436
01:56:36.163 --> 01:56:37.289
Let's go.

1437
01:56:42.794 --> 01:56:43.795
How we looking?

1438
01:56:45.005 --> 01:56:46.673
He's fallen back to fifth.

1439
01:56:49.051 --> 01:56:50.928
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1440
01:56:52.721 --> 01:56:53.889
Get him in and get him out!

1441
01:56:54.473 --> 01:56:56.308
You. Check the radiator.

1442
01:56:59.978 --> 01:57:01.188
Come on, let's go!

1443
01:57:01.855 --> 01:57:02.940
Son, take a seat.

1444
01:57:03.023 --> 01:57:05.609
Change those tires!
Come on, we're losing time!

1445
01:57:05.692 --> 01:57:07.069
Guys, what's going on?

1446
01:57:07.861 --> 01:57:10.155
-I dropped it!
-Oh, my God, what is happening?

1447
01:57:10.239 --> 01:57:12.574
Felix! What are you doing?

1448
01:57:12.658 --> 01:57:15.035
-Guys!
-Felix, come on! Where's the spare?

1449
01:57:15.953 --> 01:57:18.497
Damn it, we just lost our position.
What is happening?

1450
01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:20.958
-Where's the spare? Where's the spare?
-Are you shitting me?!

1451
01:57:26.046 --> 01:57:27.798
Oh, my God.

1452
01:57:27.881 --> 01:57:28.966
Come on!

1453
01:57:29.049 --> 01:57:31.844
<i>Look at that, it's Jack Salter
who comes to the rescue.</i>

1454
01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:43.021
-Always carry a spare.
-Sorry, sir.

1455
01:57:48.861 --> 01:57:50.696
How much did that hurt us?

1456
01:57:50.779 --> 01:57:53.699
We're running ninth, but...

1457
01:58:20.434 --> 01:58:21.977
<i>You're on great pace.</i>

1458
01:58:37.701 --> 01:58:39.453
Why don't you follow the race line?

1459
01:58:39.536 --> 01:58:42.873
You see, the other guys,
they follow that line.

1460
01:58:42.956 --> 01:58:46.793
So if I go wide like this,

1461
01:58:47.461 --> 01:58:48.921
sometimes I beat them.

1462
01:58:49.004 --> 01:58:49.838
Like that.

1463
01:58:59.348 --> 01:59:02.851
Jack, do you remember where this
whole GT Academy idea thing comes from?

1464
01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:04.561
Yeah, I'm listening.

1465
01:59:04.645 --> 01:59:09.358
The whole point of this thing was
to show that <i>GT</i> drivers can drive.

1466
01:59:09.441 --> 01:59:12.444
<i>Okay? I know this track. I know the lines.</i>

1467
01:59:12.528 --> 01:59:15.781
The line is not optimal.
Let me drive it my way.

1468
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:18.992
-Now, wait a minute. The car won't hold.
-Wait, what's he saying?!

1469
01:59:19.076 --> 01:59:21.578
<i>Yes, it will, Jack, okay?</i>

1470
01:59:21.662 --> 01:59:23.038
I need you to trust me.

1471
01:59:24.081 --> 01:59:25.499
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

1472
01:59:25.582 --> 01:59:28.001
-Please go back to the box.
-What's happening?

1473
01:59:28.085 --> 01:59:29.586
-Jann! Listen.
-Get him out of here!

1474
01:59:29.670 --> 01:59:31.630
Just finish the race.

1475
01:59:31.713 --> 01:59:34.466
There's too much at stake.
It's too big of a risk.

1476
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:36.468
-You cannot be here. Let's go.
-All right!

1477
01:59:36.552 --> 01:59:38.971
Danny, I didn't come here to finish.

1478
01:59:39.054 --> 01:59:40.848
Sir, this is your last warning.

1479
01:59:40.931 --> 01:59:42.683
I've got this, Danny.

1480
01:59:43.517 --> 01:59:45.143
-Don't push me, pal.
-Yeah.

1481
01:59:45.978 --> 01:59:47.354
You know what, fuck it.

1482
01:59:47.938 --> 01:59:49.398
<i>Follow your line, Jann.</i>

1483
02:00:00.492 --> 02:00:01.326
Come on.

1484
02:00:09.877 --> 02:00:12.504
-Holy shit!
-Yeah, Jann! Let's go!

1485
02:00:13.839 --> 02:00:14.965
<i>That's six.</i>

1486
02:00:17.926 --> 02:00:19.094
{\an8}<i>Five.</i>

1487
02:00:23.182 --> 02:00:24.183
{\an8}<i>Four.</i>

1488
02:00:25.851 --> 02:00:27.644
Come on, baby. Come on!

1489
02:00:29.605 --> 02:00:31.648
<i>It's like he's got a cheat mode engaged.</i>

1490
02:00:31.732 --> 02:00:33.567
{\an8}<i>He does. It's a new lap record!</i>

1491
02:00:34.067 --> 02:00:35.402
{\an8}Holy shit!

1492
02:00:35.485 --> 02:00:37.196
{\an8}That's a new lap record for us!

1493
02:00:37.279 --> 02:00:39.489
{\an8}No, no, no.
That's a new lap record, full stop.

1494
02:00:39.573 --> 02:00:41.700
<i>Mardenborough is on a flyer.</i>

1495
02:00:43.327 --> 02:00:49.541
<i>And we're just shy of 24 hours completed.
We find ourselves now on the final lap.</i>

1496
02:00:53.045 --> 02:00:56.048
<i>You're P-4.
You're six seconds behind Capa.</i>

1497
02:01:16.902 --> 02:01:19.321
You're only four seconds out
from standing on that podium.

1498
02:01:27.329 --> 02:01:29.665
-All right, you see him?
-Yes, I see him.

1499
02:01:31.917 --> 02:01:33.126
<i>Defend your position.</i>

1500
02:01:33.210 --> 02:01:34.878
Defend the podium.

1501
02:01:37.422 --> 02:01:38.549
Buckle up.

1502
02:01:53.522 --> 02:01:54.773
Don't try it, kid.

1503
02:01:59.862 --> 02:02:02.114
Last turn, then straight to the finish.

1504
02:02:02.197 --> 02:02:04.157
<i>Come on, do your thing. Commit.</i>

1505
02:02:04.241 --> 02:02:05.534
<i>Commit!</i>

1506
02:02:10.998 --> 02:02:12.833
Come on, punch it! Come on!

1507
02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:17.671
<i>Here they come!
Within sight of the grandstands as well.</i>

1508
02:02:17.754 --> 02:02:19.381
<i>This is absolutely phenomenal.</i>

1509
02:02:19.464 --> 02:02:21.925
<i>-It is far from over, this race.
</i>-Come on!

1510
02:02:22.009 --> 02:02:23.719
-He's gonna do it!
-Come on! Come on!

1511
02:02:51.288 --> 02:02:53.582
Yes! Yes!

1512
02:02:53.665 --> 02:02:55.501
<i>It's Mardenborough! Mardenborough!</i>

1513
02:02:55.584 --> 02:03:00.881
<i>That is a phenomenal finish
to this year's 24 Hours of Le Mans!</i>

1514
02:03:00.964 --> 02:03:02.883
<i>-I cannot believe it.
-I am speechless.</i>

1515
02:03:02.966 --> 02:03:04.551
Holy shit!

1516
02:03:04.635 --> 02:03:06.970
You did it!

1517
02:03:07.054 --> 02:03:08.555
You did it!

1518
02:03:12.184 --> 02:03:13.894
Holy shit!

1519
02:03:24.071 --> 02:03:25.072
Yes!

1520
02:03:54.101 --> 02:03:56.770
Listen, I will run your pit any day, noob.

1521
02:03:57.479 --> 02:03:58.689
There you are.

1522
02:04:30.053 --> 02:04:34.308
You're not just a SIM racer anymore.
You're one of the best in the world.
