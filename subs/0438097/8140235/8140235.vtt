1
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.144
This global warming is killing me.

2
00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:09.057
This is too hot,
the Ice Age was too cold.

3
00:03:09.143 --> 00:03:12.020
What would it take to make you happy?

4
00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:15.540
This I like.

5
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.899
Oh, no, you won't catch me.

6
00:03:57.018 --> 00:03:59.856
No running, James. Camp rules.

7
00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:03.980
Make me, sloth.

8
00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:07.261
Make me, sir. It's all about respect.

9
00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:10.819
Water ball.

10
00:04:10.906 --> 00:04:13.182
Sammy, you just ate. Wait an hour.

11
00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:15.623
Hector, no, no, no,
you can't pee-pee there.

12
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.501
OK, there is fine.
Ashley, stop picking your...

13
00:04:18.577 --> 00:04:20.102
PiЕ„ata!

14
00:04:20.179 --> 00:04:23.257
Stop! You're supposed to wear blindfolds.

15
00:04:23.343 --> 00:04:25.184
OK.

16
00:04:25.261 --> 00:04:27.783
- Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth.
- Mine.

17
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.778
- Mine.
- Mine.

18
00:04:35.063 --> 00:04:37.584
Hey, you didn't have any candy in you.

19
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:39.944
- Let's bury him.
- Yeah!

20
00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.540
Hey, whoa. Who said you kids
could torture the sloth?

21
00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:50.302
Manny, don't squash their creativity.

22
00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:54.138
Hey, Manny, Diego,
my bad mammals-jammals.

23
00:04:54.224 --> 00:04:56.257
Wanna give a sloth a hand?

24
00:04:57.743 --> 00:05:02.299
Look, I opened my camp.
"Campo del Sid". It means Camp of Sid.

25
00:05:02.376 --> 00:05:06.097
Congratulations.
You're now an idiot in two languages.

26
00:05:06.184 --> 00:05:10.663
Not in front of the k-i-d-z.
These little guys love me. Right, Billy?

27
00:05:10.739 --> 00:05:12.896
Don't make me eat you.

28
00:05:12.983 --> 00:05:16.060
They kid. That's why they're called kids.

29
00:05:16.137 --> 00:05:19.782
I told you, Sid.
You're not qualified to run a camp.

30
00:05:19.859 --> 00:05:22.497
What do qualifications
have to do with childcare?

31
00:05:22.582 --> 00:05:26.937
Besides, these kids look up to me.
I'm a role model to them.

32
00:05:28.336 --> 00:05:30.658
I can see that.

33
00:05:30.744 --> 00:05:35.060
You guys never think I can do anything,
but I'm an equal member of this herd.

34
00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:40.498
I made this herd, so you need
to start treating me with some respect.

35
00:05:42.224 --> 00:05:45.379
- Come on, Sid.
- Sid, we were just kidding.

36
00:05:45.455 --> 00:05:48.303
Hey, let's play
pin-the-tail-on-the-mammoth.

37
00:05:48.338 --> 00:05:49.781
Yeah!

38
00:05:50.298 --> 00:05:51.737
Sid!

39
00:05:51.823 --> 00:05:53.741
I can do stuff.

40
00:05:54.815 --> 00:05:57.702
Won't give me their stupid respect.

41
00:06:01.136 --> 00:06:02.659
I'll show 'em.

42
00:06:03.657 --> 00:06:09.258
And so, in the end,
the little burro reached his mommy.

43
00:06:09.334 --> 00:06:12.222
And they lived happily ever after.

44
00:06:14.822 --> 00:06:17.018
- Good job.
- Question.

45
00:06:17.104 --> 00:06:20.421
Why does the burro go home?
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbits?

46
00:06:20.498 --> 00:06:24.219
Because... because he wanted
to be with his family.

47
00:06:24.296 --> 00:06:27.537
He should go with the girl burro.
That's a better love story.

48
00:06:27.614 --> 00:06:31.096
OK, well, when you tell your burro story,
that's what he'll do.

49
00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:34.941
Burro is a demeaning name.
Technically, it's called a wild ass.

50
00:06:35.018 --> 00:06:39.534
Fine. The wild ass boy
came home to his wild ass mother.

51
00:06:40.858 --> 00:06:43.457
See, that's why I called it a burro.

52
00:06:44.857 --> 00:06:48.338
Could the burro have a grazing problem?
Then he'd be more relatable.

53
00:06:48.415 --> 00:06:50.822
- Boring.
- It's not believable.

54
00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:53.335
- Do burros eat their young?
- It's not a good ending.

55
00:06:53.422 --> 00:06:55.656
Sometimes I throw up.

56
00:06:56.261 --> 00:07:00.538
They lived happily ever after.
You can't get more satisfying than that.

57
00:07:00.615 --> 00:07:04.374
One big, happy family.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

58
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.021
Where's your big, happy family?

59
00:07:11.614 --> 00:07:15.699
Then the hungry tiger
ate the pesky little kids.

60
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.977
- You OK, buddy?
- Sure. Why not?

61
00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:22.499
- I thought...
- Story time's over. The end.

62
00:07:22.902 --> 00:07:25.741
- Run for your lives!
- Where's everybody going?

63
00:07:25.818 --> 00:07:28.781
- The world's coming to an end.
- What are you talking about?

64
00:07:28.857 --> 00:07:32.022
Fast Tony - he says
the world's gonna flood.

65
00:07:32.098 --> 00:07:34.697
Folks, I hold in my hand
a device so powerful,

66
00:07:34.774 --> 00:07:37.019
it can actually pull air
right out of the sky.

67
00:07:37.054 --> 00:07:38.056
Yeah, right.

68
00:07:38.142 --> 00:07:40.415
Gather round, gather round.

69
00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:42.899
Pardon me, do you have gills, ma'am?

70
00:07:42.976 --> 00:07:45.420
So you can't breathe underwater?

71
00:07:45.497 --> 00:07:47.741
My assistant here will demonstrate.

72
00:07:47.818 --> 00:07:50.177
Hey, I can smell the ocean.

73
00:07:50.253 --> 00:07:53.380
What are you doing?
I can't sell that now.

74
00:07:53.457 --> 00:07:56.257
You suck air through your mouth,
you moron.

75
00:07:56.334 --> 00:07:59.335
Through its design
and sturdy construction,

76
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.337
you'll have plenty of air
for eons to come.

77
00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:05.013
Of course, results may vary.

78
00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:08.973
Why are you scaring everybody
with this doomsday stuff?

79
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.774
I'm trying to make a living here, pal.

80
00:08:13.098 --> 00:08:17.135
It's my weather forecast. The five-day
outlook calls for intense flooding

81
00:08:17.222 --> 00:08:19.696
followed by the end of the world.

82
00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:23.417
And a slight chance of patchy sunshine
later in the week.

83
00:08:23.494 --> 00:08:28.097
Come on, don't listen to him. Fast Tony
would sell his own mother for a grape.

84
00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:32.576
Are you making an offer?
I mean, no, I would not.

85
00:08:32.662 --> 00:08:35.098
Haven't you heard? The ice is melting.

86
00:08:35.175 --> 00:08:37.418
You see this ground,
it's covered in ice.

87
00:08:37.495 --> 00:08:39.816
A thousand years ago,
it was covered in ice.

88
00:08:39.893 --> 00:08:42.540
A thousand years from now,
it will still be ice.

89
00:08:42.617 --> 00:08:46.779
Say, buddy, not to cast aspersions
on your survival instincts or nothing,

90
00:08:46.856 --> 00:08:50.021
but haven't mammoths
pretty much gone extinct?

91
00:08:50.098 --> 00:08:54.019
- What are you talking about?
- About you being the last of your kind.

92
00:08:54.096 --> 00:08:56.820
Your breath smells like ants.

93
00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:03.975
Be that as it may, when's the last time
you saw another mammoth?

94
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.938
Don't pay any attention to him.

95
00:09:07.015 --> 00:09:09.902
Mammoths can't go extinct.
They're the biggest things on Earth.

96
00:09:09.978 --> 00:09:11.822
What about the dinosaurs?

97
00:09:11.857 --> 00:09:14.178
The dinosaurs got cocky
and made enemies.

98
00:09:14.255 --> 00:09:17.420
Look. Some idiot's
going down the Eviscerator.

99
00:09:17.497 --> 00:09:20.421
Please tell me that's not our idiot.

100
00:09:21.054 --> 00:09:25.533
OK, I'm gonna jump
on the count of three.

101
00:09:26.694 --> 00:09:28.621
One,

102
00:09:29.292 --> 00:09:30.452
two...

103
00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:33.858
Sid, don't move a muscle.
We're coming up.

104
00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:35.612
Jump! Jump! Jump!

105
00:09:35.814 --> 00:09:37.732
Jump! Jump! Jump!

106
00:09:37.818 --> 00:09:39.256
Sorry.

107
00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:42.941
Two and three one-thousandths,
two and four one-thousandths...

108
00:09:43.017 --> 00:09:45.576
Sid, what are you doing?
Get down from there.

109
00:09:45.653 --> 00:09:48.454
No. I'm gonna be the first
to jump off the Eviscerator

110
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.773
and then you guys are gonna have to
show me some respect.

111
00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:54.898
The only respect you'll get
is respect for the dead.

112
00:09:54.975 --> 00:09:57.853
Come on, Manny, he's not that stupid.

113
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.177
- But I've been wrong before.
- Geronimo!

114
00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:07.452
Hey, watch it.

115
00:10:13.053 --> 00:10:17.858
I can't breathe.
I think I just coughed up my spleen.

116
00:10:31.573 --> 00:10:36.252
- Diego, retract the claws, please.
- Right. Sorry.

117
00:10:36.337 --> 00:10:40.577
If I didn't know you better, Diego,
I'd think you were afraid of the water.

118
00:10:40.654 --> 00:10:43.100
OK, OK. Good thing I know you better.

119
00:10:43.177 --> 00:10:44.739
Guys.

120
00:10:44.816 --> 00:10:46.897
Fast Tony was right.

121
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:50.493
Everything is melting.

122
00:11:14.095 --> 00:11:18.257
It's all gonna flood.
Come on, we gotta warn them.

123
00:11:18.334 --> 00:11:21.135
Maybe we can rapidly evolve
into water creatures.

124
00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:25.172
- That's genius, Sid.
- Call me Squid.

125
00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:31.655
This whole thing's a piece ofjunk.
I can't believe I live here.

126
00:11:33.093 --> 00:11:34.532
What?

127
00:11:39.893 --> 00:11:44.697
Forget reeds. I present you with this
revolutionary gizmo we call bark.

128
00:11:44.774 --> 00:11:49.896
- It's so buoyant, it actually floats.
- I'll show you something that floats.

129
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.936
All right, it's your funeral.

130
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:04.731
See? This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

131
00:12:04.818 --> 00:12:08.616
Giants balls of furry lava the size of
mammoths raining from the sky.

132
00:12:08.692 --> 00:12:11.339
Go suck air through a reed.

133
00:12:11.416 --> 00:12:14.658
Listen to him.
He's right about the flood.

134
00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.739
I am? I mean, yes, I am.

135
00:12:16.816 --> 00:12:21.217
Wait. You said there wasn't going to be
a flood. Why should we listen to you?

136
00:12:21.294 --> 00:12:25.178
Because we saw what's up there.
The dam's gonna break.

137
00:12:25.213 --> 00:12:27.095
The entire valley's gonna flood.

138
00:12:29.417 --> 00:12:33.053
Flood's real, all right.
And it's coming fast.

139
00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:36.092
Look around. You're in a bowl.

140
00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:41.175
BowI's gonna fill up. Ain't no way out.

141
00:12:41.971 --> 00:12:44.055
What are we gonna do?

142
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.651
Unless you make it
to the end of the valley.

143
00:12:46.738 --> 00:12:49.375
There's a boat. It can save you.

144
00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:52.291
- I don't see anything.
- But

145
00:12:52.377 --> 00:12:54.611
y'all better hurry.

146
00:12:54.697 --> 00:12:59.013
Ground's melting,
walls tumbling, rocks crumbling.

147
00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.976
Survive that
and you'll be racing the water,

148
00:13:02.052 --> 00:13:06.216
cos in three days' time,
it's gonna hit the geyser fields.

149
00:13:06.292 --> 00:13:08.210
Boom!

150
00:13:09.217 --> 00:13:11.730
There is some good news, though.

151
00:13:11.816 --> 00:13:13.772
The more of you die,

152
00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:15.777
the better I eat.

153
00:13:17.014 --> 00:13:20.370
I didn't say it was good news for you.

154
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:27.017
He must have been
a real pleasure to have in class.

155
00:13:50.091 --> 00:13:51.654
Dam.

156
00:13:52.057 --> 00:13:56.296
All right, you heard the scary vulture.
Let's move out.

157
00:13:56.373 --> 00:13:58.771
Manny, you really think there's a boat?

158
00:13:58.857 --> 00:14:02.337
I don't know, but in a few days,
this place is gonna be underwater.

159
00:14:02.414 --> 00:14:05.291
If there's any hope, it's that way.

160
00:14:25.095 --> 00:14:27.176
Manny, let's go.

161
00:14:47.489 --> 00:14:49.948
Overturned glyptodont
in the far right lane.

162
00:14:49.983 --> 00:14:52.408
Traffic backed up
as far as the eye can see.

163
00:14:52.494 --> 00:14:55.889
And it looks like
there might be a fatality.

164
00:14:55.976 --> 00:14:57.855
I call the dark meat.

165
00:14:58.652 --> 00:15:03.812
Come on, everybody, let's go.
Come on, come, come, come. Get in.

166
00:15:04.655 --> 00:15:08.051
- Come on, Grandpa, come on.
- We have to go.

167
00:15:08.137 --> 00:15:13.890
Well, I'm not leaving. I was born
in this hole and I'll die in this hole.

168
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:23.011
Do we have to bring this crap?

169
00:15:23.098 --> 00:15:28.209
- I'm sure there's crap where we're going.
- This was a gift from my mother.

170
00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:30.251
OK, keep it moving, keep it moving.

171
00:15:30.328 --> 00:15:33.014
Manny,
I just heard you're going extinct.

172
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.850
Hey, if you ever master hygiene,
try working on sensitivity.

173
00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:42.211
- I'm not going extinct.
- Kids, look. The last mammoth.

174
00:15:43.975 --> 00:15:47.092
Well, you probably won't see
another one of those again.

175
00:15:47.169 --> 00:15:48.367
See?

176
00:15:48.453 --> 00:15:51.935
OK, one, two, three... Where is James?

177
00:16:28.848 --> 00:16:31.131
Stu. Come on, Stu.

178
00:16:31.208 --> 00:16:33.855
Let's blow this ice-cube stand.

179
00:16:35.254 --> 00:16:36.855
Stu.

180
00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:47.253
Folks, be the first in the valley
to have your very own mobile home.

181
00:18:55.493 --> 00:18:57.689
- Shut up, Sid.
- OK.

182
00:19:02.571 --> 00:19:04.806
Stop singing, Sid.

183
00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:13.292
Sid, I'm going to fall on you again
and this time I will kill you.

184
00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:16.448
OK, someone doesn't like the classics.

185
00:19:26.728 --> 00:19:28.733
What if you're right?

186
00:19:28.809 --> 00:19:30.728
What if I am the last mammoth?

187
00:19:30.805 --> 00:19:33.969
But Manny, look at the bright side,
you have us.

188
00:19:34.046 --> 00:19:37.288
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid.

189
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.732
- Mammoths?
- I knew I couldn't be the last one.

190
00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:46.206
I felt it in my gut.

191
00:19:57.245 --> 00:19:59.327
Extinct? Come on.

192
00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:05.732
He's up by a couple of fifths,
ahead by a tusk.

193
00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:09.607
And he's beating Diego
as Diego's coming round the corner.

194
00:20:16.129 --> 00:20:19.888
Sorry. My stomach hates me.

195
00:20:22.334 --> 00:20:26.045
Well, don't that put
the "stink" in extinction?

196
00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:29.612
Nasty.

197
00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.286
Manny.

198
00:20:35.049 --> 00:20:37.524
I need to be alone for a while.

199
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.286
You go on ahead. I'll catch up.

200
00:20:47.009 --> 00:20:49.771
One truly is the loneliest number.

201
00:20:53.204 --> 00:20:55.324
These work great.

202
00:20:56.091 --> 00:20:57.885
Cool.

203
00:20:58.969 --> 00:21:02.690
- Missed me, now you gotta kiss me.
- I'll get 'em.

204
00:21:03.649 --> 00:21:06.813
- Which end is up?
- I'd hide that face too.

205
00:21:07.168 --> 00:21:10.573
- Hey, ugly.
- I gotta sit on that.

206
00:21:15.051 --> 00:21:16.566
Gotcha.

207
00:21:23.011 --> 00:21:24.890
OK, I'm going in.

208
00:21:25.724 --> 00:21:27.968
- Sid.
- What?

209
00:21:28.045 --> 00:21:29.771
- Nice miss.
- Cover your side.

210
00:21:29.848 --> 00:21:32.610
- I felt some breeze in that one.
- Smile.

211
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.651
- Out of my way.
- Hello.

212
00:21:40.169 --> 00:21:42.087
Over here.

213
00:21:43.649 --> 00:21:45.328
- Surrender?
- Never.

214
00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:47.044
Cool.

215
00:21:47.687 --> 00:21:49.125
Smoke them.

216
00:21:55.810 --> 00:22:00.691
If anyone asks, there were 50 of 'em
and they were rattlesnakes.

217
00:22:01.324 --> 00:22:04.248
- Here, kitty, kitty.
- Big mistake, you miscreants.

218
00:22:04.325 --> 00:22:06.723
Miscreants?

219
00:22:06.809 --> 00:22:09.005
Diego, they're possums.

220
00:22:12.286 --> 00:22:14.204
Retreat.

221
00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.651
I guess it's just you and me now.

222
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.844
I knew it.
I knew I wasn't the only one.

223
00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:59.883
Everyone falls out of the tree now
and then. They just don't admit it.

224
00:22:59.969 --> 00:23:01.485
Wait. What?

225
00:23:01.571 --> 00:23:04.131
Some of us have a tough time
holding on to branches.

226
00:23:04.208 --> 00:23:08.130
It's not like we're bats or something.
We don't have wings to keep us up.

227
00:23:08.207 --> 00:23:12.244
And you were in the tree because...?

228
00:23:12.331 --> 00:23:15.610
I was looking for my brothers.
They are always in trouble.

229
00:23:15.687 --> 00:23:18.123
Brothers? You mean there's more?

230
00:23:18.209 --> 00:23:20.127
Sure.

231
00:23:20.885 --> 00:23:22.890
- There's lots of us.
- Where?

232
00:23:23.686 --> 00:23:26.927
Everywhere.
Under rocks. In holes in the ground.

233
00:23:27.004 --> 00:23:30.082
Usually we come out at night
so birds don't carry us off.

234
00:23:30.168 --> 00:23:32.249
Help! Help!

235
00:23:32.326 --> 00:23:34.244
Help!

236
00:23:38.282 --> 00:23:42.444
Well, shave me down and call me
a mole rat. You found another mammoth.

237
00:23:42.531 --> 00:23:46.088
Where? Wait a minute.
I thought mammoths were extinct.

238
00:23:47.691 --> 00:23:52.246
- What are you looking at me for?
- I don't know. Because you're a mammoth.

239
00:23:52.323 --> 00:23:56.687
Me? Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not a mammoth. I'm a possum.

240
00:23:56.763 --> 00:24:00.608
Right. Good one. I'm a newt.
This is my friend, the badger.

241
00:24:00.685 --> 00:24:02.651
And my other friend, the platypus.

242
00:24:02.727 --> 00:24:06.247
Why do I gotta be the platypus?
Make him the platypus.

243
00:24:06.323 --> 00:24:09.489
- This guy giving you trouble, sis?
- Sis?

244
00:24:09.565 --> 00:24:14.447
That's right. These are my brothers.
Possum, possum, possum.

245
00:24:14.927 --> 00:24:19.366
I don't think her tree
goes all the way to the top branch.

246
00:24:20.641 --> 00:24:23.529
Manny, brink of extinction's
a bad time to be picky.

247
00:24:23.606 --> 00:24:25.726
Hey, she should come with us.

248
00:24:25.802 --> 00:24:28.286
Are you insane? No way.

249
00:24:28.363 --> 00:24:29.849
OK.

250
00:24:29.926 --> 00:24:33.848
Manny wants me to ask you
if you'd like to escape the flood with us.

251
00:24:33.925 --> 00:24:37.243
- I'd rather be road kill.
- That can be arranged.

252
00:24:37.329 --> 00:24:41.722
Funny. Let me have a little word
with my brothers.

253
00:24:41.808 --> 00:24:44.685
Ellie, are you crazy?
We're not going with them.

254
00:24:44.762 --> 00:24:47.965
Look, we'll never make it in time
if we only travel at night.

255
00:24:48.042 --> 00:24:52.290
These guys can protect us out in the open.
What do you say?

256
00:24:53.565 --> 00:24:55.080
Why did you invite them?

257
00:24:55.167 --> 00:24:58.245
Cos you might be
the only two mammoths left on Earth.

258
00:24:58.322 --> 00:24:59.534
He has a point.

259
00:24:59.569 --> 00:25:02.446
Sorry, when did I join
this dating service?

260
00:25:02.523 --> 00:25:06.609
My brothers and I
would be delighted to come with you.

261
00:25:06.686 --> 00:25:08.881
If you treat us nicely.

262
00:25:08.967 --> 00:25:11.442
See that?
That's the total opposite of nice.

263
00:25:11.528 --> 00:25:14.089
Maybe we'll have a snack
before we hit the road.

264
00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:17.206
You want a piece of us? Let's go.

265
00:25:17.283 --> 00:25:19.009
Banzai!

266
00:25:19.086 --> 00:25:21.407
- I got 'em.
- Back! Back!

267
00:25:23.046 --> 00:25:27.121
You know the best part?
We're carrying diseases.

268
00:25:32.607 --> 00:25:36.242
OK, thanks to Sid,
we're now travelling together.

269
00:25:36.328 --> 00:25:39.887
And like it or not,
we're going to be one big, happy family.

270
00:25:39.964 --> 00:25:42.687
I'll be the daddy,
Ellie will be the mommy.

271
00:25:42.763 --> 00:25:46.523
And Diego will be the uncle
who eats the kids who get on my nerves.

272
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.321
Now, let's move it before the ground
falls out from under our feet.

273
00:25:50.407 --> 00:25:53.208
I thought fat guys
were supposed to be jolly.

274
00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:57.322
I'm not fat. It's this fur,
it makes me look big.

275
00:25:57.409 --> 00:26:00.208
- It's poofy.
- OK.

276
00:26:00.285 --> 00:26:02.366
He's fat.

277
00:26:35.204 --> 00:26:39.126
Escaping the flood is the perfect time
to shed those unsightly pounds

278
00:26:39.203 --> 00:26:41.926
with Fast Tony's Disaster Diet.

279
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.962
You, ma'am, you look
like a big, fat, hairy beast.

280
00:26:47.048 --> 00:26:49.926
How would you like
to lose a ton or two?

281
00:26:50.002 --> 00:26:51.526
Would I ever.

282
00:26:51.603 --> 00:26:56.168
Don't listen to him, Vera.
You're already thin as a twig.

283
00:26:56.244 --> 00:27:01.088
I also have the perfect cure
for your eyesight, my blind friend.

284
00:27:29.245 --> 00:27:31.163
We'll never make it at this pace.

285
00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.488
Ellie, it's OK, you can
lose the camouflage. You're safe.

286
00:27:35.565 --> 00:27:38.327
OK. Safe? Please.

287
00:27:38.404 --> 00:27:40.360
Crash, Eddie, you two go scope it out.

288
00:27:40.447 --> 00:27:42.565
- What you got?
- Perimeter all clear.

289
00:27:42.642 --> 00:27:47.399
- Roger that. One-niner, over.
- Roger, over, victor...

290
00:27:47.485 --> 00:27:49.279
- Guys.
- All clear.

291
00:27:55.561 --> 00:27:57.239
Hawk!

292
00:28:04.239 --> 00:28:07.520
- What are you doing?
- Playing dead.

293
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.759
- Manny, why don't you do that?
- Because I'm a mammoth.

294
00:28:11.845 --> 00:28:14.128
But you'd do it for treats, right?

295
00:28:14.962 --> 00:28:17.119
Is he gone?

296
00:28:19.325 --> 00:28:21.320
You're safe. Get up.

297
00:28:22.327 --> 00:28:23.401
Man.

298
00:28:23.487 --> 00:28:27.764
If you weren't here, that hawk would have
swooped down and snatched me for dinner.

299
00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:30.402
That's how cousin Wilton went.

300
00:28:33.403 --> 00:28:35.600
Boy, I really feel for you. I do.

301
00:28:35.687 --> 00:28:39.801
I can't even imagine what it'd be like
to be the last one of your species.

302
00:28:39.887 --> 00:28:44.164
- I'm not the last one.
- You brave, brave soul.

303
00:28:44.241 --> 00:28:47.128
That's right. Don't give up hope.

304
00:28:48.566 --> 00:28:50.522
Ellie.

305
00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:53.322
Look at our footprints.

306
00:28:53.399 --> 00:28:55.567
They're the same shape.

307
00:28:56.085 --> 00:28:58.646
Well, how do I know
those aren't your footprints?

308
00:28:58.722 --> 00:29:00.679
Well, then,

309
00:29:00.765 --> 00:29:02.961
look at our shadows.

310
00:29:03.038 --> 00:29:05.244
We match.

311
00:29:05.321 --> 00:29:07.919
You're right. They're the same.

312
00:29:08.005 --> 00:29:10.086
You must be part possum.

313
00:29:13.127 --> 00:29:15.045
You wish.

314
00:29:27.598 --> 00:29:30.687
Diego, there are whole continents
moving faster than you.

315
00:29:30.763 --> 00:29:33.641
We gotta catch up with the others.

316
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.844
Hey. Knock it off.

317
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:49.925
Cry me a river, blubber-tooth tiger.
Have some fun.

318
00:29:50.002 --> 00:29:53.041
The ice is thin enough
without you two wearing it down.

319
00:29:53.118 --> 00:29:55.199
Diego, come on. The ice may be thin,

320
00:29:55.285 --> 00:30:00.925
but it's strong enough to hold
a ten-ton mammoth and a nine-ton possum.

321
00:30:22.359 --> 00:30:24.239
Mammal overboard!

322
00:30:37.962 --> 00:30:41.559
Ellie, get up.
If you play dead, you'll be dead.

323
00:30:41.645 --> 00:30:43.602
Look at me.

324
00:30:49.845 --> 00:30:51.801
Diego.

325
00:30:59.483 --> 00:31:00.797
Diego.

326
00:31:09.965 --> 00:31:12.084
Come on, Diego. Come on.

327
00:31:13.599 --> 00:31:16.198
This may sting a little.

328
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.279
- What in the animal kingdom was that?
- I don't know.

329
00:32:21.365 --> 00:32:25.076
From now on,
land - safe, water - not safe.

330
00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.679
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

331
00:32:33.755 --> 00:32:36.555
- It was nothing. I...
- It's not a compliment.

332
00:32:36.641 --> 00:32:38.598
To a possum, bravery is just dumb.

333
00:32:38.674 --> 00:32:41.523
- Yeah, we're spineless.
- Lily-livered.

334
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.880
Maybe mammoths are going extinct
because they get in danger.

335
00:32:44.957 --> 00:32:47.844
Maybe you should run away more.

336
00:32:47.921 --> 00:32:50.116
Good point. Thanks for the advice.

337
00:32:50.202 --> 00:32:52.121
Happy to help.

338
00:32:52.955 --> 00:32:57.319
Do you believe her? "Bravery is dumb.
Maybe you should run away more".

339
00:32:57.395 --> 00:33:00.359
She's infuriating
and stubborn and narrow-minded.

340
00:33:00.436 --> 00:33:02.603
You like her.

341
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:07.043
- I do not.
- Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

342
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.680
- And so is yours.
- What secret?

343
00:33:09.757 --> 00:33:12.395
You know, the one where you can't swim.

344
00:33:12.481 --> 00:33:13.721
That's ridiculous.

345
00:33:13.756 --> 00:33:16.115
Fine. But we're living
in a melting world.

346
00:33:16.202 --> 00:33:20.517
You're going to have to
face your fear sooner or later.

347
00:34:17.235 --> 00:34:19.479
Almost there.

348
00:34:20.322 --> 00:34:22.595
- OK. Ready, Eddie?
- Set.

349
00:34:22.682 --> 00:34:24.601
Let's roll.

350
00:34:26.883 --> 00:34:28.955
Wait for me.

351
00:34:39.234 --> 00:34:42.879
No brakes. Gotta roll.
Meet you at the other end.

352
00:34:42.956 --> 00:34:45.756
So you think she's the girl for me?

353
00:34:45.842 --> 00:34:48.882
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at all.

354
00:34:48.958 --> 00:34:51.481
She completes you.

355
00:34:53.563 --> 00:34:55.039
Yeah.

356
00:34:55.116 --> 00:34:59.203
Hey, Manny. Can you pull back the tree
and shoot me into the pond?

357
00:34:59.278 --> 00:35:01.524
- No.
- Come on.

358
00:35:01.916 --> 00:35:04.122
You expect to impress
with that attitude?

359
00:35:04.157 --> 00:35:05.561
I don't want to impress.

360
00:35:05.638 --> 00:35:08.399
Why are you trying
to convince her she's a mammoth?

361
00:35:08.476 --> 00:35:11.995
Because that's what she is.
I don't care if she thinks she's a possum.

362
00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:16.282
- You can't be two things.
- Au contraire, Man-fered.

363
00:35:16.359 --> 00:35:18.919
Tell that to the bullfrog,
chicken hawk or turtledove.

364
00:35:18.996 --> 00:35:21.244
He's never gonna let up on you.

365
00:35:21.279 --> 00:35:24.759
It'll be easier on all of us
if you just go with it.

366
00:35:26.313 --> 00:35:28.561
So what do you want me to do?

367
00:35:28.596 --> 00:35:30.955
Pull the tree
and shoot me into the pond.

368
00:35:31.041 --> 00:35:32.560
I don't know.

369
00:35:32.595 --> 00:35:35.396
If you're too lame to do it,
we can get Ellie.

370
00:35:35.483 --> 00:35:38.082
No, no, no. No, I can do it.
I can do it.

371
00:35:38.159 --> 00:35:40.037
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.

372
00:35:40.114 --> 00:35:43.681
- Have you done this before?
- Only a million times.

373
00:35:44.113 --> 00:35:46.194
Farther, farther, farther.

374
00:35:46.837 --> 00:35:49.081
Perfect. Fire!

375
00:35:51.162 --> 00:35:53.435
Yeah! I can fly!

376
00:36:04.914 --> 00:36:06.592
Crash!

377
00:36:08.396 --> 00:36:10.841
Crash! Crash!

378
00:36:10.917 --> 00:36:13.401
- Crash, are you OK?
- What happened?

379
00:36:13.478 --> 00:36:16.317
- Manny shot him out of a tree.
- What's wrong with you?

380
00:36:16.394 --> 00:36:19.598
- He said he could do it.
- And you listened to him?

381
00:36:19.674 --> 00:36:22.915
Crash, whatever you do,
don't go into the light.

382
00:36:23.002 --> 00:36:25.073
Can I help in any way here?

383
00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.999
You've done enough.

384
00:36:28.517 --> 00:36:32.716
- Are you happy now?
- Crash, Crash, don't leave me.

385
00:36:32.793 --> 00:36:35.076
Who's gonna watch my back?

386
00:36:35.152 --> 00:36:38.595
Who's gonna be my wingman of mayhem?

387
00:36:38.681 --> 00:36:42.758
Who's gonna roll
in that dung patch with me?

388
00:36:42.835 --> 00:36:44.714
Dung patch?

389
00:36:44.801 --> 00:36:49.355
- Wait. My legs. I can stand.
- He can stand.

390
00:36:49.432 --> 00:36:52.999
- I can run.
- He can run. It's a miracle.

391
00:36:53.076 --> 00:36:54.994
Hallelujah!

392
00:37:00.999 --> 00:37:05.794
What can I say? They're boys.
They make my life a little adventure.

393
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.996
You guys are so dead.
Thanks for embarrassing me.

394
00:37:09.073 --> 00:37:11.154
Not the face.

395
00:37:21.436 --> 00:37:23.679
Ellie, Ellie, me too.

396
00:37:23.756 --> 00:37:25.837
She's not half bad.

397
00:37:27.035 --> 00:37:30.392
Crazy and confused, but sweet.

398
00:37:30.479 --> 00:37:32.397
So?

399
00:37:33.873 --> 00:37:36.280
So what's holding you back?

400
00:37:38.515 --> 00:37:40.434
My family.

401
00:37:43.838 --> 00:37:46.313
You can have that again, you know.

402
00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:48.480
No, Sid, I can't.

403
00:37:49.756 --> 00:37:53.112
OK, OK, but think about it.
I mean, if you let this chance go,

404
00:37:53.199 --> 00:37:58.031
you're letting your whole species go
and that's just... that's just selfish.

405
00:38:04.351 --> 00:38:07.632
I think I'm starting
to get through to him.

406
00:38:08.715 --> 00:38:11.679
- Wait, wait. I got you.
- Slowpoke.

407
00:38:15.352 --> 00:38:19.274
- Need help?
- No, no. Just catching my breath.

408
00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.960
- You're stuck.
- I am not.

409
00:38:22.037 --> 00:38:24.598
All right, then, let's go.

410
00:38:26.161 --> 00:38:27.800
I can't.

411
00:38:28.434 --> 00:38:29.997
I'm stuck.

412
00:38:30.073 --> 00:38:34.513
Don't you think that picking them up
like this would be easier?

413
00:38:50.432 --> 00:38:51.996
Ellie?

414
00:39:13.757 --> 00:39:15.876
I know this place.

415
00:41:14.672 --> 00:41:18.517
You know, deep down,
I knew I was different.

416
00:41:20.991 --> 00:41:24.951
I was a little bigger
than the other possum kids.

417
00:41:25.038 --> 00:41:27.435
OK, a lot bigger.

418
00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:32.998
Now I understand why the possum boys
didn't find me appealing.

419
00:41:33.075 --> 00:41:38.752
That's too bad,
because as far as mammoths go, you're,

420
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:41.072
- you know.
- What?

421
00:41:45.474 --> 00:41:47.115
Attractive.

422
00:41:47.191 --> 00:41:50.154
- Really?
- Sure.

423
00:41:50.231 --> 00:41:53.349
What about me is attractive?

424
00:41:55.392 --> 00:41:57.309
I don't know.

425
00:41:57.395 --> 00:41:59.553
Well, there's your

426
00:42:00.916 --> 00:42:02.949
butt.

427
00:42:03.678 --> 00:42:05.989
What about it?

428
00:42:06.076 --> 00:42:08.118
It's

429
00:42:08.195 --> 00:42:10.353
big.

430
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:12.472
You're just saying that.

431
00:42:13.038 --> 00:42:15.875
No, no, no, I mean it.

432
00:42:15.952 --> 00:42:20.028
It's huge.
Biggest darn butt I've ever seen.

433
00:42:20.114 --> 00:42:22.953
That is really sweet.

434
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:25.188
What a crazy day.

435
00:42:25.274 --> 00:42:30.395
This morning I woke up a possum
and now I'm a mammoth.

436
00:44:12.351 --> 00:44:14.949
Boy, Manny sure took a big leap
with Ellie today.

437
00:44:15.035 --> 00:44:17.270
Sure did.

438
00:44:17.356 --> 00:44:21.950
He stood on the shore of uncertainty
and dove right in. Splash.

439
00:44:22.027 --> 00:44:25.354
Kind of brave, huh?
The way he faced his fear.

440
00:44:25.431 --> 00:44:28.510
I wouldn't know.
Sabres don't feel fear.

441
00:44:28.596 --> 00:44:32.950
Come on, all animals feel fear.
It's what separates us from, say, rocks.

442
00:44:33.026 --> 00:44:35.434
Rocks have no fear.

443
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.866
- And they sink.
- What are you getting at, Sid?

444
00:44:38.953 --> 00:44:43.634
It may surprise you to know
that I, too, have experienced fear.

445
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:45.427
No. You?

446
00:44:45.514 --> 00:44:47.949
Yeah. Yes, as impossible as it seems,

447
00:44:48.035 --> 00:44:53.473
the sloth has natural enemies that would
like to harm or otherwise "kill" us.

448
00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.188
- I wonder why?
- Jealousy, mostly.

449
00:44:56.274 --> 00:44:59.113
But the point is that fear is natural.

450
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.632
Fear is for prey.

451
00:45:02.709 --> 00:45:06.266
Well, then, you're letting
the water make you its prey.

452
00:45:06.352 --> 00:45:10.112
Justjump in and trust your instincts.

453
00:45:10.189 --> 00:45:12.788
You know, most animals
can swim as babies.

454
00:45:12.875 --> 00:45:18.628
And for a tiger, it's like crawling
on your belly to stalk helpless prey.

455
00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:23.587
But faster, OK?
Now, claw, kick, claw, kick.

456
00:45:23.673 --> 00:45:26.551
I'm stalking the prey. Claw, kick.

457
00:45:26.627 --> 00:45:29.427
I look back over my shoulder
to see if I'm being followed.

458
00:45:29.513 --> 00:45:31.748
And I'm breathing.

459
00:45:31.834 --> 00:45:35.115
And I'm stalking
and I'm stalking and I'm...

460
00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:40.667
- I'm falling.
- Correction. You're sinking.

461
00:45:40.753 --> 00:45:43.150
Kind of like a rock.

462
00:45:47.754 --> 00:45:50.430
Hey, do we do any special tricks
like roll over?

463
00:45:50.506 --> 00:45:53.470
Or do we just throw our weight around?

464
00:45:53.547 --> 00:45:55.235
Whoops. Sorry.

465
00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:57.785
I don't know my own strength yet.

466
00:45:57.871 --> 00:46:02.072
Ellie, do you realise that now
we have a chance to save our species?

467
00:46:02.148 --> 00:46:06.628
- Really? How are we gonna do that?
- Well, you know...

468
00:46:06.715 --> 00:46:08.508
Did you just...?

469
00:46:08.594 --> 00:46:12.268
I'm not a mammoth for five minutes
and you're hitting on me?

470
00:46:12.354 --> 00:46:15.911
I wasn't saying...
Not right now. In time.

471
00:46:15.988 --> 00:46:18.510
I was just saying that
it's our responsibility.

472
00:46:18.545 --> 00:46:19.834
What?

473
00:46:19.911 --> 00:46:22.586
All right, that came out wrong. I...

474
00:46:22.672 --> 00:46:24.667
You're very pretty, but we just met...

475
00:46:24.753 --> 00:46:27.986
Responsibility?
Just doing your duty? Is that it?

476
00:46:28.072 --> 00:46:31.907
Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice
to save your species.

477
00:46:31.993 --> 00:46:37.508
I got some news for you. You're not saving
the species tonight or any other night.

478
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:50.791
- So, how did it go?
- Not bad.

479
00:46:55.788 --> 00:46:58.387
OK, let's go.
We travelled with you all day,

480
00:46:58.422 --> 00:47:00.948
now you're coming with us at night.

481
00:47:01.034 --> 00:47:03.106
But we can't see at night.

482
00:47:03.192 --> 00:47:05.311
Then enjoy the flood.

483
00:47:05.387 --> 00:47:07.987
I can't even look at him.

484
00:47:08.073 --> 00:47:09.991
Pervert.

485
00:47:14.546 --> 00:47:19.351
Making friends everywhere you go.
Just making friends.

486
00:47:42.425 --> 00:47:45.551
- Watch out, there's a stump.
- Not anymore.

487
00:47:47.269 --> 00:47:49.705
I thought we could walk together.

488
00:47:49.791 --> 00:47:52.313
Crash,
ask the mammoth why he thinks that.

489
00:47:52.389 --> 00:47:55.544
She said she thinks you're ajerk
and to go away.

490
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:57.548
She didn't say...

491
00:47:58.431 --> 00:48:01.309
Look, maybe if we spend more time...

492
00:48:01.385 --> 00:48:05.231
Tell him that I need
a little personal space right now.

493
00:48:05.308 --> 00:48:10.027
- She said go jump in a lake.
- And possums rule.

494
00:48:10.113 --> 00:48:12.990
- I can hear her, you know.
- What do you want? A medal?

495
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:26.349
Stop moving.

496
00:48:29.465 --> 00:48:31.307
Thank you.

497
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:40.706
Manny, Ellie. Lock trunks.

498
00:48:43.429 --> 00:48:45.423
Now!

499
00:48:49.672 --> 00:48:53.067
Crash, Eddie. Grab on to that ledge.

500
00:48:58.227 --> 00:49:01.632
- Funny. Now what's your real plan?
- Just do it.

501
00:49:01.708 --> 00:49:03.665
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Crash.

502
00:49:03.751 --> 00:49:05.986
- Bye, Ellie.
- Go now.

503
00:49:10.225 --> 00:49:13.792
I'm sorry if what I said before
offended you.

504
00:49:13.869 --> 00:49:16.305
What do you mean "if" it offended me?

505
00:49:17.552 --> 00:49:19.873
That it offended her!

506
00:49:19.949 --> 00:49:22.672
I mean that, that it offended you.

507
00:49:26.384 --> 00:49:28.945
- You just overreacted, that's all.
- What?

508
00:49:29.031 --> 00:49:31.783
- Take it back.
- There are other lives at stake here.

509
00:49:31.869 --> 00:49:34.066
- He's got a point.
- He's got nothing.

510
00:49:34.152 --> 00:49:36.905
- It was a misunderstanding.
- It was insensitive.

511
00:49:36.992 --> 00:49:39.666
- Apologise.
- Why me? She overreacted.

512
00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:41.911
- Just apologise.
- No.

513
00:49:41.987 --> 00:49:44.788
- Do it.
- OK, I'm sorry.

514
00:49:44.865 --> 00:49:46.265
What?

515
00:49:46.351 --> 00:49:48.749
- He's right. I overreacted.
- You mean...

516
00:49:48.825 --> 00:49:53.227
Not another word or I'll come down there
and push you over myself.

517
00:49:53.947 --> 00:49:56.392
I got it. I got it.

518
00:49:56.469 --> 00:49:58.386
I got it.

519
00:50:04.064 --> 00:50:06.231
Manny, Ellie, run! Run!

520
00:50:18.507 --> 00:50:21.912
I guess we finally
did something right together.

521
00:50:21.989 --> 00:50:26.833
Hey, don't mind me.
Just hanging off the edge of a cliff here.

522
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:48.985
- Remember the good old days?
- Which good old days?

523
00:50:49.071 --> 00:50:52.427
You know. Yesterday, last week.

524
00:50:52.504 --> 00:50:57.751
Back when the trees went up and down
and the ground stayed under our feet.

525
00:50:57.828 --> 00:51:00.264
Yep. Those were the good days.

526
00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:04.627
Possums were possums
and mammoths were mammoths.

527
00:51:04.703 --> 00:51:07.063
- We should get some sleep.
- Yeah.

528
00:51:07.149 --> 00:51:11.944
Tomorrow's the day
the vulture said we're all going to die.

529
00:52:23.546 --> 00:52:25.867
Wait a minute.

530
00:52:25.944 --> 00:52:28.351
Can I help you?

531
00:52:38.544 --> 00:52:41.422
Now, that's what I call respect.

532
00:52:43.541 --> 00:52:44.865
Nice.

533
00:52:50.628 --> 00:52:53.668
Somebody here likes Sid.

534
00:52:54.186 --> 00:52:58.022
Who is your decorator?
I mean, this is fabulous.

535
00:53:02.866 --> 00:53:05.388
Fire King.

536
00:53:11.103 --> 00:53:16.743
Fire King? Well, you know, it's about time
someone recognised my true potential.

537
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:18.901
Let there be fire.

538
00:54:25.745 --> 00:54:28.468
If only the guys could see me now.

539
00:54:30.022 --> 00:54:33.187
This is either really good
or really bad.

540
00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:36.227
No, no, no.

541
00:54:36.303 --> 00:54:38.704
Me Fire King. Why kill Fire King?

542
00:54:38.739 --> 00:54:42.020
A thousand years' bad juju
for killing Fire King.

543
00:54:42.106 --> 00:54:45.022
Super-heated rock from Earth's core
is surging to the crust,

544
00:54:45.108 --> 00:54:47.342
melting ice built up
over thousands of years.

545
00:54:47.428 --> 00:54:51.341
You're a very advanced race.
Together, we can look for a solution.

546
00:54:51.427 --> 00:54:53.940
We have one - sacrifice the Fire King.

547
00:54:54.027 --> 00:54:56.865
- Well, that's not very advanced.
- Worth a shot.

548
00:54:57.661 --> 00:54:59.579
No! No!

549
00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.265
Bad juju!

550
00:55:37.863 --> 00:55:40.021
Water? Water!

551
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:48.163
Crash, I told you not to drink
before bed.

552
00:55:48.198 --> 00:55:50.907
I didn't do this.
At least, not all of it.

553
00:55:50.984 --> 00:55:54.263
- What's happening?
- We overslept. We need to move.

554
00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:56.546
What if we're the last creatures
left alive?

555
00:55:56.581 --> 00:55:58.742
We'll have to repopulate the Earth.

556
00:55:58.819 --> 00:56:02.021
How? Everyone's either
a dude or our sister.

557
00:56:02.943 --> 00:56:05.666
Hi. Hey, Manny.

558
00:56:05.743 --> 00:56:08.581
Wow. What a night.
You'll never guess what happened.

559
00:56:08.668 --> 00:56:11.026
You were sleepwalking.

560
00:56:11.103 --> 00:56:14.546
No, no, no. I was kidnapped
by a tribe of mini sloths.

561
00:56:14.623 --> 00:56:17.778
- That was gonna be my second guess.
- And they worshiped me.

562
00:56:17.864 --> 00:56:21.902
I mean, sure, they tossed me into a
flaming tar pit, but they worshiped me.

563
00:56:21.979 --> 00:56:25.825
You were dreaming. Come on, the water's
rising faster than we're moving.

564
00:56:25.901 --> 00:56:30.859
I'm telling you, I was kidnapped.
I was worshiped. Guys.

565
00:56:30.945 --> 00:56:32.864
Fine.

566
00:56:39.386 --> 00:56:43.145
Can we slow down a little?
I'm dying here.

567
00:56:47.067 --> 00:56:49.426
It was just a figure of speech.

568
00:56:54.222 --> 00:56:57.904
They just sit there, watching us.

569
00:56:57.981 --> 00:57:00.705
I wish I knew what they were thinking.

570
00:58:30.104 --> 00:58:32.857
There. Now you know
what they were thinking.

571
00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:40.942
- Sid!
- What? It's catchy.

572
00:58:52.863 --> 00:58:56.383
- We made it.
- Yeah, we showed those scary vultures.

573
00:59:21.423 --> 00:59:25.537
It's just a little hot water and steam.
How bad could it be?

574
00:59:31.857 --> 00:59:35.579
I just did something
involuntary and messy.

575
00:59:36.584 --> 00:59:38.502
OK, come on.

576
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.061
Manny. Get back.
It's a minefield out there.

577
00:59:42.138 --> 00:59:44.977
There's only one way to go.
Straight through.

578
00:59:45.063 --> 00:59:48.861
Straight through? We'd like to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you.

579
00:59:48.937 --> 00:59:52.103
- We'll head back and go around.
- There's no time.

580
00:59:52.179 --> 00:59:54.738
The dam will burst before we make it.
We'll drown.

581
00:59:54.815 --> 00:59:57.184
If we go through this,
we get blown to bits.

582
00:59:57.261 --> 00:59:59.103
- We go forward.
- We go back.

583
00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:01.576
- Forward.
- Back.

584
01:00:01.663 --> 01:00:03.821
- Can I say something?
- No.

585
01:00:03.898 --> 01:00:08.578
- You are so stubborn and hard-headed.
- Well, I guess that proves it.

586
01:00:08.665 --> 01:00:10.583
I am a mammoth.

587
01:00:12.059 --> 01:00:15.177
- Come on.
- Fine.

588
01:00:15.263 --> 01:00:18.504
I don't know. Drowning sounds like
a much gentler way to go.

589
01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:22.024
Blown to bits sounds so sudden.

590
01:00:32.218 --> 01:00:35.220
He's going to get himself killed.
Manny, wait.

591
01:00:35.297 --> 01:00:36.975
Manny.

592
01:00:58.976 --> 01:01:01.660
Kids, look, the last mammoth.

593
01:01:01.736 --> 01:01:03.980
I just heard you're going extinct.

594
01:01:04.057 --> 01:01:07.539
- You can't be two things.
- She thinks you're ajerk.

595
01:01:07.616 --> 01:01:10.263
Where's your big, happy family?

596
01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.824
What's wrong with you?

597
01:01:12.901 --> 01:01:15.222
Manny, come on. We gotta go. Now!

598
01:01:22.183 --> 01:01:23.622
That way.

599
01:02:01.656 --> 01:02:07.421
Do not leave your children unattended.
All unattended children will be eaten.

600
01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.338
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No, sorry.

601
01:02:13.415 --> 01:02:15.457
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No.

602
01:02:15.534 --> 01:02:18.536
Possum? About 11 foot tall?

603
01:02:20.138 --> 01:02:23.380
- Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?
- I sure have. Big as life.

604
01:02:23.456 --> 01:02:25.461
- Where?
- I'm looking at him.

605
01:02:25.537 --> 01:02:27.694
Not me.

606
01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:29.862
Poor guy doesn't know he's a mammoth.

607
01:03:26.981 --> 01:03:31.661
- I don't see her anywhere.
- Maybe she's already on board.

608
01:03:44.101 --> 01:03:46.019
Hurry, this way. Come on.

609
01:03:48.215 --> 01:03:51.735
- There it is.
- Ellie! Help!

610
01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.581
Come on, come on, run!

611
01:04:08.421 --> 01:04:10.339
Push.

612
01:04:12.938 --> 01:04:16.219
- You guys gotta go.
- We're not leaving you.

613
01:04:16.295 --> 01:04:18.655
- I'm not asking.
- Ellie, no.

614
01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.700
Ellie, don't worry.
We're going for help.

615
01:04:23.776 --> 01:04:25.541
Stay here.

616
01:04:39.494 --> 01:04:43.215
- Help us.
- Help! Somebody help.

617
01:04:43.301 --> 01:04:45.295
Manny.

618
01:04:45.497 --> 01:04:47.578
Manny.

619
01:04:51.136 --> 01:04:54.177
- Manny.
- It's Ellie, she's trapped in a cave.

620
01:05:52.141 --> 01:05:53.732
Ellie.

621
01:05:53.819 --> 01:05:55.737
Manny.

622
01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:02.018
- Help!
- I'll save you.

623
01:06:06.257 --> 01:06:08.453
Great. Who's gonna save him?

624
01:06:10.975 --> 01:06:13.017
You really need to brush.

625
01:06:18.053 --> 01:06:21.536
OK, OK, OK. Jump in now.

626
01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:25.180
Come on, 'fraidy cat. Come on.

627
01:06:25.256 --> 01:06:29.015
You can do this, you can do this,
you can do this.

628
01:06:29.091 --> 01:06:31.375
Trust your instincts. Attack the water.

629
01:06:31.451 --> 01:06:33.494
I am not your prey. I am not your prey.

630
01:06:33.571 --> 01:06:35.892
I am not your prey.

631
01:06:58.016 --> 01:07:00.413
Attack the water. Stalking the prey.

632
01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:03.895
Claw, kick. Even babies can do it.
Come on.

633
01:07:03.971 --> 01:07:07.818
Claw, kick, claw, kick.

634
01:07:07.895 --> 01:07:10.896
Hey. I'm stalking the prey.

635
01:07:16.536 --> 01:07:18.453
Eddie.

636
01:07:31.572 --> 01:07:35.370
You did it, buddy.
You kicked water's butt.

637
01:07:35.456 --> 01:07:38.736
Nothing to it. Most animals
can swim as babies, you know.

638
01:07:38.812 --> 01:07:41.930
Yeah, but not tigers.
I left that part out.

639
01:07:56.575 --> 01:07:59.413
There he is.

640
01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:01.811
Ellie, hold on to me.

641
01:08:32.413 --> 01:08:34.734
Manny, Manny, behind you.

642
01:09:10.209 --> 01:09:12.137
There they are.

643
01:09:13.172 --> 01:09:15.177
They made it.

644
01:09:25.256 --> 01:09:28.171
We thought we'd never see you again.

645
01:09:37.128 --> 01:09:39.209
We're gonna live.

646
01:09:42.691 --> 01:09:45.491
We're gonna die.

647
01:11:34.609 --> 01:11:36.252
Well, I'm not leaving.

648
01:11:36.287 --> 01:11:39.212
Grandpa, let go of the boat.
The flood's over.

649
01:11:39.289 --> 01:11:44.056
- This is my boat now.
- Come on, let's go. Come on, come on.

650
01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:48.055
Stu. We made it. We're gonna live.

651
01:11:48.132 --> 01:11:50.328
Well, I am anyway.

652
01:11:52.772 --> 01:11:55.574
I'm thinking about starting
a swim school.

653
01:11:55.651 --> 01:11:58.010
Sid's Squids.

654
01:12:02.729 --> 01:12:05.769
All hail Fire King.

655
01:12:10.774 --> 01:12:12.491
Hi.

656
01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:21.813
Fire King avert flood.
Join us, O great and noble flaming one.

657
01:12:24.967 --> 01:12:28.967
No, not so fast there, OK.
You make a quality offer.

658
01:12:29.052 --> 01:12:34.414
But Fire King has a prior commitment.
His herd needs him.

659
01:12:34.894 --> 01:12:40.888
He is the gooey, sticky stuff
that holds us together.

660
01:12:41.973 --> 01:12:47.572
He made this herd,
and we'd be nothing without him.

661
01:12:47.649 --> 01:12:51.131
- You mean it?
- Sid. Sid.

662
01:12:51.207 --> 01:12:54.008
That doesn't mean "want to touch".

663
01:12:59.406 --> 01:13:01.449
Don't ask.

664
01:13:59.326 --> 01:14:02.291
We're not the last ones anymore.

665
01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:08.926
You're not coming?

666
01:14:09.013 --> 01:14:11.171
You wanna go with them?

667
01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:13.328
I am a mammoth.

668
01:14:13.405 --> 01:14:15.928
I should probably be with a mammoth.

669
01:14:16.014 --> 01:14:18.412
Don't you think?

670
01:14:18.488 --> 01:14:20.406
Yeah, unless...

671
01:14:22.132 --> 01:14:24.051
Unless?

672
01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.771
Unless I...

673
01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:32.845
I just wanna say...

674
01:14:33.726 --> 01:14:35.971
I need to tell you...

675
01:14:37.688 --> 01:14:41.447
I hope you find everything
you're looking for.

676
01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:46.607
You too.

677
01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:25.170
Manny, you've come a long way since we
met and I'll take full credit for that,

678
01:15:25.247 --> 01:15:30.052
but you need to let go of the past
so you can have a future.

679
01:15:33.925 --> 01:15:36.764
- Go after her.
- It's OK.

680
01:15:37.647 --> 01:15:39.804
We'll always be here for you.

681
01:15:40.486 --> 01:15:44.168
- I'll keep in touch.
- Yeah, yeah. You're a good friend.

682
01:15:44.245 --> 01:15:46.806
Point made. Now, go on. Scat.

683
01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:55.685
Our Manny's growing up.

684
01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:59.051
Ellie! Ellie!

685
01:16:03.166 --> 01:16:05.084
Manny.

686
01:16:06.532 --> 01:16:10.407
Ellie, I don't want us
to be together because we have to.

687
01:16:10.484 --> 01:16:13.006
I want us to be together
because we want to.

688
01:16:13.092 --> 01:16:15.164
And I wanna be with you, Ellie.

689
01:16:16.804 --> 01:16:21.369
- What do you say?
- Manny, I thought you were going...

690
01:16:25.204 --> 01:16:27.525
You're possum enough for me.

691
01:16:41.172 --> 01:16:46.811
Well, it's just you and me now.
Two bachelors knocking about in the wild.

692
01:16:47.205 --> 01:16:49.450
Fine. But I'm not gonna carry you.

693
01:16:49.526 --> 01:16:54.053
- I still have my pride, you know.
- Come on, buddy, for old time's sake.

694
01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:56.528
I'll carry him.

695
01:16:58.004 --> 01:17:00.804
- But your herd's leaving.
- We are now.

696
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:02.290
Shotgun!

697
01:17:04.448 --> 01:17:07.047
Manny, who do you like better?
Me or Diego?

698
01:17:07.124 --> 01:17:10.289
- Diego. It's not even close.
- Told you.

699
01:17:10.366 --> 01:17:13.166
Manny, you can't choose
between your kids.

700
01:17:13.252 --> 01:17:16.167
He's not my kid. Not even my dog.

701
01:17:16.244 --> 01:17:18.731
If I had a dog and my dog had a kid...

702
01:17:18.766 --> 01:17:21.288
and the dog's kid had a pet,
that would be Sid.

703
01:17:21.365 --> 01:17:23.849
- Can I have a dog, Manny?
- No.

704
01:17:23.926 --> 01:17:26.726
- Ellie, can I have a dog?
- Of course you can, sweetie.

705
01:17:26.802 --> 01:17:30.169
Ellie,
we have to be consistent with him.

706
01:19:43.724 --> 01:19:45.968
I saved you, little buddy.

707
01:19:57.850 --> 01:20:01.724
Calm down.
I saved you, little buddy. Remember?
