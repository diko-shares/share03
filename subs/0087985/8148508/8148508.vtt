THE ROUGH RIDER

12
00:02:41.214 --> 00:02:43.251
FAR BETTER IT IS
TO DARE MIGHTY THINGS...

13
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:46.176
THAN TO TAKE RANK WITH THOSE
POOR, TIMID SPIRTIS WHO KNOW

14
00:02:46.376 --> 00:02:49.001
NEITHER VICTORY NOR DEFEAT.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT- 1899

15
00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:53.590
Thanks for the ride.

16
00:02:53.663 --> 00:02:56.097
Get going.
You don't have time for breakfast.

17
00:02:56.167 --> 00:02:57.759
Are you working or what?

18
00:02:57.835 --> 00:03:01.134
Yeah, I'll be at the station all day,
so hitch a ride home.

19
00:03:01.206 --> 00:03:04.664
- You got practice today?
- After that, man, we're on double time.

20
00:03:04.744 --> 00:03:07.941
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You'd think they'd take it down.

21
00:03:08.014 --> 00:03:11.575
Come on, bud.
You lost a football game once yourself.

22
00:03:11.652 --> 00:03:13.643
What? I don't remember.

23
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:15.712
I do.

24
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.724
I think you're lying.

25
00:03:17.793 --> 00:03:20.728
- I don't know when to believe your mouth.
- Likewise.

26
00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:27.902
- Later, bud.
- See you, Jed.

27
00:03:27.972 --> 00:03:31.100
- Did you do your history?
- Yeah. Some of it.

28
00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:33.804
<i>The Great Hunt would always begin...</i>

29
00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.007
<i>with the armies spread out
in a semicircle...</i>

30
00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:40.143
<i>I would say about
the size of Rhode Island.</i>

31
00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:42.519
Then they would ride forward...

32
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.684
driving everything before them:

33
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.890
beasts, men... even bugs.

34
00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:56.168
<i>Now the ends would kind of close
in to form a shrinking circle.</i>

35
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.801
And everything within that circle
panicked to get out.

36
00:03:59.878 --> 00:04:02.745
When the Mongols
could see each other...

37
00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:06.581
they had worked themselves up
into a pretty good frenzy.

38
00:04:07.954 --> 00:04:11.253
<i>Now when this killing started...</i>

39
00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:15.091
<i>it'd last for days, weeks...</i>

40
00:04:15.163 --> 00:04:16.960
even months.

41
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.195
And it went on...

42
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.263
until the young son of the Khan...

43
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:28.209
asked his father
that the last creature alive...

44
00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:35.918
be allowed to...

45
00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:37.957
go free.

46
00:04:39.393 --> 00:04:41.486
well now, my friend.

47
00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:44.997
- well, now.
- They're all over!

48
00:04:45.067 --> 00:04:47.729
<i>- Check it out.
- All right!</i>

49
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.735
<i>They look pretty cool, though.</i>

50
00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.744
<i>I would say they were
way off course.</i>

51
00:04:57.281 --> 00:04:59.613
<i>This is very unusual.</i>

52
00:05:01.653 --> 00:05:03.518
<i>Better do something,
Mr. Teasdale.</i>

53
00:05:23.113 --> 00:05:25.047
What's going on, my friend?

54
00:05:49.712 --> 00:05:51.771
Come on!
Let's go!

55
00:06:24.723 --> 00:06:26.350
Get in!

56
00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:28.256
Get down! Get down!

57
00:06:30.396 --> 00:06:32.591
- Get in!
- Wait!

58
00:06:41.242 --> 00:06:43.039
Run! Get in!

59
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.810
THEY CAN HAVE MY GUN WHEN THEY
PRY IT FROM MY COLD DEAD FINGERS

60
00:07:56.636 --> 00:07:58.433
Dad!

61
00:07:58.504 --> 00:08:00.529
What's happening?
What's happening?

62
00:08:00.607 --> 00:08:03.804
- They're shooting at everybody!
- Shooting?

63
00:08:07.015 --> 00:08:10.382
- We're going to the mountains.
- Can you tell who they are?

64
00:08:10.452 --> 00:08:12.943
I heard some of them
speaking Spanish, Mr. Morris.

65
00:08:13.022 --> 00:08:15.320
Did you see any of them?

66
00:08:18.462 --> 00:08:20.396
Oh, my God.

67
00:08:22.868 --> 00:08:24.130
Boys...

68
00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:27.639
get in there and get
sleeping bags and food right now.

69
00:08:27.707 --> 00:08:30.039
Come on.
Hurry up, boys.

70
00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:32.236
Come on, son.

71
00:08:32.313 --> 00:08:36.079
- Take the dry stuff.
- Get the dehydrated stuff.

72
00:08:37.085 --> 00:08:38.518
Get plenty of Kleenex.

73
00:08:38.587 --> 00:08:40.919
- Get some lanterns.
- .38 Specials.

74
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.823
Grab some toilet paper.
I ain't gonna use no leaves.

75
00:08:43.893 --> 00:08:45.952
Bring a lot of that.

76
00:08:49.767 --> 00:08:51.792
Be sure to take
a lot of batteries.

77
00:08:54.073 --> 00:08:55.700
Get a shotgun.

78
00:08:55.774 --> 00:08:57.708
Get those down jackets.

79
00:08:58.578 --> 00:09:00.205
Matt, look!

80
00:09:01.281 --> 00:09:03.181
Get down! Get down!

81
00:09:04.852 --> 00:09:06.581
Lay down.

82
00:09:12.295 --> 00:09:13.728
Is it ours?

83
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.634
Son, I love you.

84
00:09:18.702 --> 00:09:21.933
I love you, Dad.
Tell Mom I love her.

85
00:09:22.007 --> 00:09:25.966
- I'll take care of him.
- Boys, just get out of here.

86
00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:28.479
And don't come back here.

87
00:09:28.548 --> 00:09:30.982
No matter what you see or hear,
don't come back.

88
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:33.485
I'll come and get you soon enough.

89
00:09:39.995 --> 00:09:42.429
Open the glove compartment.

90
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:47.362
- Is it there?
- Yeah.

91
00:09:47.438 --> 00:09:49.133
Load it.

92
00:09:53.178 --> 00:09:55.840
- It's already loaded.
- Give it here.

93
00:09:57.684 --> 00:10:00.676
- Want these also, Jed?
- Put them in my pocket.

94
00:10:07.997 --> 00:10:09.430
Jesus Christ.

95
00:10:09.498 --> 00:10:11.329
Oh, Jesus, Jesus.

96
00:10:12.336 --> 00:10:14.031
I'm gonna turn off.

97
00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:33.089
It's a helicopter!

98
00:10:47.045 --> 00:10:48.808
It's ours!

99
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.911
Get in! Get in!

100
00:11:05.067 --> 00:11:08.764
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

101
00:11:08.838 --> 00:11:12.365
Only thing is, we got one problem.
We don't have any water.

102
00:11:13.477 --> 00:11:15.411
How about pissing in it?

103
00:11:19.184 --> 00:11:22.847
- That's a good idea.
- How do you know it'll work?

104
00:11:22.922 --> 00:11:25.288
- How old are you, kid?
- Fifteen.

105
00:11:25.358 --> 00:11:27.792
And the name's Danny, not " kid."

106
00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:31.888
well, when you grow up,
you'll know these things, Danny.

107
00:11:31.966 --> 00:11:34.730
Now get up here
and piss in the radiator.

108
00:12:37.747 --> 00:12:40.841
We've got Yankee Tanks
coming in from the plains.

109
00:12:40.918 --> 00:12:43.045
We've lost most of
our night vision...

110
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.578
and have only a few
antitank missiles left.

111
00:12:46.658 --> 00:12:50.651
Put your best men into hunter
groups armed with RPG's.

112
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.666
Have your men dig holes
100 meters apart.

113
00:12:54.735 --> 00:12:58.136
Wait until the Yankees
approach to strike...

114
00:12:58.206 --> 00:13:00.667
you have to know where
they attack them from.

115
00:13:00.867 --> 00:13:03.979
Then gather your
group and face them.

116
00:13:04.179 --> 00:13:05.612
Yes, Sir, Bella.

117
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.075
I want some antiaircraft here.

118
00:13:09.152 --> 00:13:11.484
We're working on it, sir.

119
00:13:11.556 --> 00:13:14.457
This...this is a madhouse!

120
00:13:14.526 --> 00:13:16.255
Do you want to see me?

121
00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:20.731
Yes...yes.
Go to the sporting goods store.

122
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.169
From the files, obtain form 4473.

123
00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:28.766
These will contain
descriptions of weapons...

124
00:13:28.843 --> 00:13:31.311
and lists of private ownership.

125
00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:42.047
But our families, huh?
What about them, huh?

126
00:13:43.461 --> 00:13:46.157
We gotta stay up here
and hide awhile.

127
00:13:47.232 --> 00:13:50.030
I just want to go home.

128
00:13:50.103 --> 00:13:53.368
I don't want to hide.
If I hide, they'll never find me.

129
00:13:59.848 --> 00:14:01.406
Check it out.

130
00:14:01.483 --> 00:14:04.384
Stopped a bullet
that would have hit somebody.

131
00:14:05.455 --> 00:14:07.685
I got these.

132
00:14:07.758 --> 00:14:11.592
Those will do us a lot of good.
We've got no radio.

133
00:14:11.663 --> 00:14:14.496
How long do you think we can survive
on olives and Rice Krispies?

134
00:14:15.835 --> 00:14:17.769
What else are we gonna do?

135
00:14:21.608 --> 00:14:24.975
As Calumet Student Body President...

136
00:14:25.046 --> 00:14:27.742
I forward the motion
that we give ourselves up.

137
00:14:27.815 --> 00:14:29.840
I second the motion.

138
00:14:29.918 --> 00:14:32.113
We can't stay here.
We need stuff and--

139
00:14:32.187 --> 00:14:33.415
Sit down, Danny.

140
00:14:37.193 --> 00:14:39.559
It's too dangerous
to go into town.

141
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.497
- I say we vote on it.
- No.

142
00:14:42.567 --> 00:14:46.367
It isn't the big game, Mr. Quarterback.
He can go wherever he wants.

143
00:14:47.573 --> 00:14:49.666
You're such a goddamn jock.

144
00:14:52.046 --> 00:14:54.480
Come on, guys!
Knock it off!

145
00:14:57.485 --> 00:15:00.545
If you want to go so bad,
take your shit!

146
00:15:01.657 --> 00:15:03.682
That goes for the rest of you.

147
00:15:05.295 --> 00:15:06.762
This is your chance.
Get walk in.

148
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:10.393
It's World War III down there.

149
00:15:10.468 --> 00:15:13.335
People are being killed.

150
00:15:16.175 --> 00:15:17.608
Those could be Russians.

151
00:15:18.645 --> 00:15:22.342
Jed, what about your family?

152
00:15:29.524 --> 00:15:32.186
I don't know.

153
00:15:32.261 --> 00:15:34.559
But I'm alive.

154
00:15:34.631 --> 00:15:39.330
And I'm staying here.
My family would want me to stay alive.

155
00:15:39.404 --> 00:15:41.964
Your family would
want you to stay alive.

156
00:15:43.743 --> 00:15:48.077
You think you're so smart, man,
but you're just a bunch of scared kids.

157
00:15:52.386 --> 00:15:53.944
What do you think you are?

158
00:15:56.492 --> 00:15:58.221
Alone, I guess.

159
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.891
No, you're not.

160
00:16:04.735 --> 00:16:06.168
Hey, bud.

161
00:16:09.207 --> 00:16:11.038
What do you say?

162
00:16:24.726 --> 00:16:26.159
I'm with you.

163
00:16:31.301 --> 00:16:33.360
Now the rest of you get going.

164
00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:42.613
all right, but if you stay...

165
00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:45.650
you're gonna do
exactly what I say, okay?

166
00:16:51.325 --> 00:16:53.555
So come on over here
and get warm.

167
00:16:54.462 --> 00:16:55.724
Daryl.

168
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.611
I'm sorry.

169
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.047
Me too, man.

170
00:17:20.328 --> 00:17:24.287
Matt and I have been coming up to these
mountains with our dad our whole lives.

171
00:17:24.366 --> 00:17:28.700
We can hunt, we can fish.
We can stay up here a long, long time.

172
00:17:30.673 --> 00:17:32.607
How long, Jed?

173
00:17:36.748 --> 00:17:39.012
Until we don't hear that no more.

174
00:17:39.451 --> 00:17:42.147
OCTOBER

175
00:17:53.502 --> 00:17:55.094
I got him!

176
00:17:56.672 --> 00:17:58.435
You got him.

177
00:18:05.016 --> 00:18:07.644
He's still breathing!

178
00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:10.984
Never shoot twice.
If you shoot twice, they can find you.

179
00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:15.058
- He's dead anyway.
- How do you know?

180
00:18:19.701 --> 00:18:23.865
I used to read a lot about
Jedediah Smith and Jim Bridger.

181
00:18:24.774 --> 00:18:29.006
The Blackfeet, if you shot twice,
would know right where you were.

182
00:18:29.846 --> 00:18:32.110
My dad named me after Jed Smith.

183
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.654
This is your first time, isn't it?

184
00:18:38.724 --> 00:18:40.658
Yeah. Why?

185
00:18:40.726 --> 00:18:43.661
You gotta drink if it's your first.
We did.

186
00:18:45.265 --> 00:18:46.698
What's it taste like?

187
00:18:46.767 --> 00:18:48.792
It's not too bad.

188
00:18:48.869 --> 00:18:52.270
It's kind of salty, like a steak
or when you get a nosebleed.

189
00:18:52.341 --> 00:18:55.208
You gotta do it, Robert.
It's the spirit of the deer.

190
00:18:59.683 --> 00:19:02.948
When you drink it,
you'll be a real hunter.

191
00:19:07.392 --> 00:19:09.121
Bottoms up.

192
00:19:12.032 --> 00:19:13.693
Go. Go ahead.

193
00:19:17.905 --> 00:19:20.533
Go for it, buddy.

194
00:19:22.211 --> 00:19:23.803
All right! All right!

195
00:19:25.849 --> 00:19:27.282
You did it.

196
00:19:28.785 --> 00:19:31.879
His blood is yours.
My dad said that once you do that...

197
00:19:31.956 --> 00:19:35.892
there's gonna be something
different about you... always.

198
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.064
It wasn't so bad.

199
00:19:45.472 --> 00:19:47.406
It wasn't that bad.

200
00:19:50.578 --> 00:19:52.443
It wasn't so bad.

201
00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:03.984
That's the last of it,
except for the olives.

202
00:20:04.062 --> 00:20:05.620
We still got
plenty of meat left.

203
00:20:05.697 --> 00:20:07.164
Just stuff you shot.

204
00:20:07.232 --> 00:20:10.201
So tell me, dork, where do you suppose
hamburgers come from?

205
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.760
Nobody shoots them.

206
00:20:11.838 --> 00:20:13.499
We need food.

207
00:20:15.376 --> 00:20:16.809
We need to know.

208
00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.042
We do.

209
00:20:27.024 --> 00:20:28.958
We'll go into town.

210
00:20:59.462 --> 00:21:01.726
There's no one here, either.

211
00:21:04.068 --> 00:21:06.593
Looks like it's been here
for a thousand years.

212
00:21:13.977 --> 00:21:15.569
Come on.

213
00:21:27.363 --> 00:21:29.388
The stores are open.

214
00:21:29.466 --> 00:21:31.730
There's people everywhere!
Maybe it's over!

215
00:21:33.437 --> 00:21:35.871
- Don't go anywhere.
- Those aren't our troops.

216
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.431
You can't tell from here, Jed.

217
00:21:40.445 --> 00:21:43.881
What is that? I've never seen
a tank like that before.

218
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.942
Yeah, but they're packed.
That means something.

219
00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:51.151
Let's stash our stuff.
Leave it all here.

220
00:21:55.932 --> 00:21:58.457
That's the Mayor's car.

221
00:21:58.534 --> 00:22:02.664
- They got Daryl's dad's car.
- Look at the size of that tank.

222
00:22:08.514 --> 00:22:11.642
Lewis. Lewis, how you doing?

223
00:22:15.722 --> 00:22:17.883
Was he scared of us?

224
00:22:36.047 --> 00:22:38.641
Hey, let's ask Alicia.
She'll know.

225
00:22:50.164 --> 00:22:52.155
Six toothbrushes, please.

226
00:22:54.236 --> 00:22:56.670
- Jed!
- How's your sister?

227
00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.641
- Where did you come from?
- We've been hiding in the mountains.

228
00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.235
Are you crazy?
You gotta get out of here.

229
00:23:02.313 --> 00:23:06.113
We will, but first we gotta
find out what's going--

230
00:23:10.456 --> 00:23:13.857
They know who all of you are.
They're looking for you.

231
00:23:13.927 --> 00:23:15.986
- Who?
- The KGB.

232
00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:18.463
- The Russians?
- And the Cubans.

233
00:23:21.136 --> 00:23:23.434
Look, have you seen my father?

234
00:23:23.506 --> 00:23:26.929
I called, there was no answer.
The station was empty.

235
00:23:28.912 --> 00:23:30.539
Okay, listen.

236
00:23:30.615 --> 00:23:34.244
I'm gonna tell you something
nobody's supposed to talk about, but--

237
00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:35.783
But what?

238
00:23:36.488 --> 00:23:40.356
But they took a lot of people away,
people they thought would make trouble.

239
00:23:40.427 --> 00:23:43.419
people who had guns or things
they wanted, they just took them away.

240
00:23:43.497 --> 00:23:44.780
Where?

241
00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.060
Reeducation camps.
That's what they call it.

242
00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:51.435
The drive-in.
I heard they took a lot of people to--

243
00:23:53.076 --> 00:23:55.010
I pray for you.

244
00:23:56.346 --> 00:23:58.644
<i>America is a whorehouse...</i>

245
00:23:58.716 --> 00:24:01.651
<i>where the revolutionary ideals
of your forefathers...</i>

246
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:06.316
<i>are corrupted and sold in alleys
by vendors of capitalism.</i>

247
00:24:06.969 --> 00:24:09.833
<i>You grow fat on the flesh
of freedom fighters...</i>

248
00:24:33.174 --> 00:24:35.940
- Hey.
- Yeah?

249
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.290
Could you find my dad,
Tom Eckert? I'm Jed.

250
00:24:38.364 --> 00:24:42.134
- Jed? Matt?
- Mr. Barnes?

251
00:24:43.537 --> 00:24:46.131
I'll go find your dad.
I know right where he is.

252
00:24:48.443 --> 00:24:50.843
You know Morris' Market
out on the highway?

253
00:24:50.913 --> 00:24:53.006
Can you see if Mr. Morris
is in there too?

254
00:24:53.083 --> 00:24:55.517
I'll look around for him too, son.

255
00:25:14.575 --> 00:25:15.769
Daddy?

256
00:25:19.816 --> 00:25:21.750
I can stand up.

257
00:25:22.159 --> 00:25:23.421
Boys.

258
00:25:33.232 --> 00:25:37.066
Don't talk. Don't say anything.
Let me look at you.

259
00:25:38.538 --> 00:25:42.941
<i>well, I knew I was right.
I knew it.</i>

260
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.944
You're alive.

261
00:25:46.048 --> 00:25:47.982
I was tough on both of you.

262
00:25:49.318 --> 00:25:52.913
<i>And I did things that made you--</i>

263
00:25:52.989 --> 00:25:54.923
<i>that made you hate me sometimes.</i>

264
00:25:56.327 --> 00:25:58.386
But you understand now,
don't you?

265
00:26:00.398 --> 00:26:03.663
What happened, Dad?
Why are you here? What did they do?

266
00:26:04.971 --> 00:26:06.905
It doesn't matter.

267
00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:10.709
One way or another...

268
00:26:11.946 --> 00:26:14.471
for one reason or another,
we're all gone.

269
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:17.279
<i>It's all gone.</i>

270
00:26:20.055 --> 00:26:21.488
Remember...

271
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.295
remember when you used to go
in the park and play...

272
00:26:27.932 --> 00:26:30.662
and I used to
put you on the swings...

273
00:26:30.736 --> 00:26:33.068
and both of you were...

274
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.700
so damn little?

275
00:26:41.282 --> 00:26:44.649
I remember.
I remember all of it.

276
00:26:44.719 --> 00:26:47.620
I ain't gonna be around
to pick you up when you fall now.

277
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.022
Both of you got to
take care of each other now.

278
00:26:52.429 --> 00:26:54.624
We'll never see you again, Dad.

279
00:26:54.698 --> 00:26:57.223
Yes, you will.
I don't want to hear that, Mattie.

280
00:26:58.136 --> 00:27:01.333
What happened to Mom, Dad?
Where is she?

281
00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:13.824
We can't afford
to be crying anymore.

282
00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:18.592
I don't want either one of you
to ever cry for me again.

283
00:27:20.129 --> 00:27:24.065
Don't ever do it
not as long as you live.

284
00:27:24.902 --> 00:27:26.836
Where's my dad, Mr. Eckert?

285
00:27:29.574 --> 00:27:31.337
I don't know, son.

286
00:27:32.411 --> 00:27:33.844
I don't know.

287
00:27:36.483 --> 00:27:38.713
You all get going now.

288
00:27:39.787 --> 00:27:41.414
Get out before they find you.

289
00:27:49.599 --> 00:27:51.123
I love you.

290
00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.038
I know you do, son.
I love you too.

291
00:28:13.294 --> 00:28:14.727
Boys!

292
00:28:16.532 --> 00:28:18.864
Avenge me!

293
00:28:42.898 --> 00:28:45.128
I'll be damned.
Get in here.

294
00:28:45.201 --> 00:28:48.136
Mr. Mason, how are you doing?
Good to see you.

295
00:28:52.476 --> 00:28:54.740
We got us some outlaws here.

296
00:28:56.881 --> 00:28:59.145
Wow, a house.

297
00:28:59.218 --> 00:29:01.015
Go on and find a chair.

298
00:29:01.087 --> 00:29:04.022
Last time we were in a house
was five weeks.

299
00:29:04.091 --> 00:29:05.524
You look it.

300
00:29:10.866 --> 00:29:12.925
Who you got out there with you?

301
00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:15.333
We got Danny, we got Daryl.

302
00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.471
We all figured you boys
had headed for F.A. by now.

303
00:29:20.544 --> 00:29:21.738
What's F.A.?

304
00:29:21.812 --> 00:29:24.042
Free America.
That's the safe zone.

305
00:29:24.116 --> 00:29:25.174
Where are we?

306
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:29.414
Hell, you boys is in
occupied territory.

307
00:29:29.489 --> 00:29:31.753
You're 40 miles
behind the enemy lines.

308
00:29:31.824 --> 00:29:34.987
Right smack dab
in the middle of World War III.

309
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.996
What are you boys doing
fooling around town anyway?

310
00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:44.539
We've been looking for news,
Mr. Mason.

311
00:29:44.607 --> 00:29:48.168
We haven't even seen or talked
to anybody since it all started.

312
00:29:49.179 --> 00:29:51.113
Wait here just a minute.

313
00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.586
I wish there was more.

314
00:29:58.658 --> 00:29:59.750
I'm sorry.

315
00:29:59.826 --> 00:30:02.420
Thank you, Mrs. Mason.
We really appreciate it.

316
00:30:09.304 --> 00:30:11.238
This'll keep you boys warm.

317
00:30:12.508 --> 00:30:14.635
Use this to see
where you're standing.

318
00:30:16.647 --> 00:30:19.639
A radio?
We can't take this.

319
00:30:21.052 --> 00:30:24.180
That's all right.
I got another one.

320
00:30:24.255 --> 00:30:25.916
You boys listen to me.

321
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:29.825
- Don't go to Calumet no more.
- How come?

322
00:30:29.896 --> 00:30:33.332
Because there's been
some attacks up there.

323
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:36.962
people waking up
with their throats cut.

324
00:30:38.707 --> 00:30:40.299
Word has it, it's you.

325
00:30:48.686 --> 00:30:51.120
What happened to my dad and mom?

326
00:30:52.724 --> 00:30:54.521
Your daddy's dead, Robert.

327
00:30:55.728 --> 00:30:57.662
They shot him.

328
00:30:59.031 --> 00:31:01.499
Russians found some guns missing...

329
00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:04.503
so they shot him
for aiding guerrillas.

330
00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.603
What do you mean, aiding guerrillas?
He never aided anybody.

331
00:31:09.678 --> 00:31:12.806
- We took the stuff!
- We killed him!

332
00:31:12.883 --> 00:31:14.851
They killed him, son.

333
00:31:14.918 --> 00:31:17.716
Made him an example.

334
00:31:17.788 --> 00:31:21.315
Now you boys listen to me
and let that burn in real good.

335
00:31:23.161 --> 00:31:25.629
I don't know where
your mother is, Robert.

336
00:31:25.698 --> 00:31:27.165
I got nobody now.

337
00:31:27.233 --> 00:31:31.192
If you boys need food, a bed,
anything, you come here.

338
00:31:37.245 --> 00:31:40.737
I got a couple of heirlooms
I want to hide with you.

339
00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:42.249
Jack, no.

340
00:31:50.461 --> 00:31:52.156
My granddaughters.

341
00:31:52.231 --> 00:31:55.359
They spent two days
sneaking here.

342
00:31:56.469 --> 00:31:59.499
Those sons-of-bitches
tried having their way with them.

343
00:32:03.978 --> 00:32:06.676
Toni...
Erica.

344
00:32:06.748 --> 00:32:09.876
This is Matt and Jed Eckert.
They're gonna take care of you.

345
00:32:12.088 --> 00:32:14.682
And I don't wanna know
where they're going.

346
00:32:15.926 --> 00:32:17.518
Bye, Grandpa.

347
00:32:33.381 --> 00:32:35.372
Good luck, son.

348
00:32:35.451 --> 00:32:39.979
Here. Here's a box of ammo
for your granddaddy's pistol.

349
00:32:40.056 --> 00:32:42.217
- Thanks.
- Good luck to you.

350
00:32:42.292 --> 00:32:44.817
I'll take care of them.
Don't worry.

351
00:32:57.644 --> 00:33:00.408
<i>It's 11:59 at Radio Free America.</i>

352
00:33:00.481 --> 00:33:03.177
<i>This is Uncle Sam with
music and the truth until dawn.</i>

353
00:33:03.251 --> 00:33:05.913
<i>We've got a few words for some
of our brothers and sisters...</i>

354
00:33:05.988 --> 00:33:07.979
<i>in the occupied zone.</i>

355
00:33:08.057 --> 00:33:11.458
<i>The chair is against the wall.
The chair is against the wall.</i>

356
00:33:11.528 --> 00:33:15.555
<i>John has a long mustache.
John has a long mustache.</i>

357
00:33:15.633 --> 00:33:18.158
<i>It's 12:00,
another day closer to victory.</i>

358
00:33:18.236 --> 00:33:21.330
<i>For all of you out there
on or behind the lines...</i>

359
00:33:21.407 --> 00:33:23.637
<i>this is your song.</i>

360
00:33:47.505 --> 00:33:49.598
Things are different now.

361
00:34:10.667 --> 00:34:12.601
They're coming up.

362
00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.474
Let's go tell the others.

363
00:34:32.193 --> 00:34:34.127
Oh, how beautiful.

364
00:34:46.211 --> 00:34:48.372
What is written here?

365
00:34:49.381 --> 00:34:52.475
You studied English. Translate.

366
00:34:53.319 --> 00:34:56.288
American history...
I know this well.

367
00:35:00.295 --> 00:35:03.128
Arapaho National Battlefield.

368
00:35:03.198 --> 00:35:06.395
Here was a great peasant uprising...

369
00:35:06.469 --> 00:35:10.929
in 1908 of wild Indians.

370
00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:14.876
They were crushed by
President Theodore Roosevelt...

371
00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:20.009
leading imperialist armies
and cowboys.

372
00:35:20.085 --> 00:35:24.920
The battle lasted all winter.
More than 35,000 were killed.

373
00:35:24.991 --> 00:35:29.428
It was the greatest battle
of the American West.

374
00:35:29.497 --> 00:35:31.431
Bravo!

375
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.663
Yuri, stay here.
I'll take a photo of you.

376
00:35:39.643 --> 00:35:41.634
African baboon.

377
00:35:43.014 --> 00:35:44.447
Now you.

378
00:35:46.618 --> 00:35:48.552
Come here, my friend.

379
00:35:52.392 --> 00:35:54.451
Hurry up, you fool.

380
00:36:06.476 --> 00:36:08.410
Look at me, Yuri.

381
00:36:13.852 --> 00:36:17.948
Look. Look what I've found.
An arrow.

382
00:36:18.024 --> 00:36:19.787
An Indian arrow.

383
00:36:19.859 --> 00:36:22.487
What a philosopher you are.

384
00:36:22.563 --> 00:36:25.031
I did not know
the Indians used steel.

385
00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:28.762
Sure, you fool. They used the melted
sabers of Federalist Cossacks.

386
00:36:28.837 --> 00:36:32.830
Did these Indians
work in plastic, too?

387
00:36:32.908 --> 00:36:36.708
You idiot. This is bone,
polished to a high sheen.

388
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.873
There must be more.

389
00:36:42.654 --> 00:36:43.746
Look.

390
00:36:47.893 --> 00:36:51.192
Watch out! She has a weapon.

391
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.534
Stop, damn it!

392
00:36:59.541 --> 00:37:01.133
Quickly, catch him!

393
00:37:09.286 --> 00:37:10.719
Take cover!

394
00:37:13.458 --> 00:37:14.736
Stop!

395
00:37:21.902 --> 00:37:23.870
Help me, comrades.

396
00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.440
Grab him!

397
00:37:27.509 --> 00:37:29.340
I got him!

398
00:37:30.346 --> 00:37:31.679
I'm dying.

399
00:38:32.088 --> 00:38:34.079
Help!

400
00:38:34.158 --> 00:38:35.819
Help!

401
00:39:18.212 --> 00:39:19.645
They were people.

402
00:39:19.713 --> 00:39:22.011
Yeah, well, so was my dad.

403
00:39:23.785 --> 00:39:25.719
What was it like?

404
00:39:29.091 --> 00:39:30.786
It was good.

405
00:39:34.365 --> 00:39:36.731
One thing is for sure now.

406
00:39:37.802 --> 00:39:40.100
No one can ever
go home again.

407
00:39:41.139 --> 00:39:42.899
Never.

408
00:39:46.212 --> 00:39:48.476
Why don't you
make yourself useful?

409
00:39:48.549 --> 00:39:50.540
You wash it!

410
00:39:50.618 --> 00:39:52.776
We ain't never doing
your washing again.

411
00:39:52.976 --> 00:39:54.918
Me and her is as
good as any of you.

412
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:56.423
So what's up your ass?

413
00:39:56.492 --> 00:39:58.221
Shut up!

414
00:39:59.295 --> 00:40:02.162
Don't you ever say that again!

415
00:40:02.232 --> 00:40:04.860
Hear me?
You say that again, I'll kill you.

416
00:40:04.936 --> 00:40:06.699
<i>Hear me?</i>

417
00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:08.363
I'll kill you.

418
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.244
So what did I do?

419
00:40:14.314 --> 00:40:16.714
What you said was wrong.

420
00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.198
From now on...

421
00:41:04.442 --> 00:41:08.606
all troops
are forbidden to travel...

422
00:41:08.806 --> 00:41:12.449
in any group
smaller than squad size.

423
00:41:12.649 --> 00:41:17.045
- outside secured areas...
- Yes, sir, Bella.

424
00:41:17.245 --> 00:41:19.217
Then call Bratchenko.

425
00:41:19.294 --> 00:41:25.392
Tell him Sector Eight is now active.

426
00:41:25.468 --> 00:41:27.095
Right away, Colonel Bella.

427
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.333
And I want some interrogations made...

428
00:41:30.407 --> 00:41:32.637
starting with the Mayor.

429
00:41:33.778 --> 00:41:37.509
I'm sick of his...pleasantries.

430
00:41:37.583 --> 00:41:39.574
Consider it done.

431
00:41:41.655 --> 00:41:44.488
Daryl, he wouldn't hurt a fly.

432
00:41:44.558 --> 00:41:46.651
I know my son, Colonel.

433
00:41:46.727 --> 00:41:48.957
He's not the guerrilla type.

434
00:41:49.031 --> 00:41:51.022
According to records, Mayor...

435
00:41:51.099 --> 00:41:55.092
your son is a prominent
student leader.

436
00:41:55.171 --> 00:41:59.608
Ahh, yes, well, he's a leader,
but not in a violent or physical way.

437
00:41:59.677 --> 00:42:04.239
No, you see, Daryl, he's more of
a politician, like his father.

438
00:42:06.317 --> 00:42:09.878
A member of an elite
paramilitary organization:

439
00:42:09.955 --> 00:42:11.388
Eagle Scout.

440
00:42:11.458 --> 00:42:14.359
Yes, but that's not military.

441
00:42:14.428 --> 00:42:17.090
If he's alive,
he's scared, he's hungry...

442
00:42:17.165 --> 00:42:19.793
and he's just as anxious
to avoid conflicts as you and me.

443
00:42:19.868 --> 00:42:21.301
He's not a troublemaker.

444
00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:22.667
Then who is?

445
00:42:27.577 --> 00:42:29.511
Well, let's just say
it runs in some of the families.

446
00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:35.443
This community is indeed fortunate
to have a shepherd like him.

447
00:42:41.094 --> 00:42:44.700
well, I just want to see
this thing through, Colonel.

448
00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.196
If you have any more problems,
you call me--

449
00:42:47.268 --> 00:42:48.844
Thank you.

450
00:42:50.506 --> 00:42:52.269
We're finished...

451
00:42:53.509 --> 00:42:54.942
for now.

452
00:44:34.233 --> 00:44:37.168
<i>Oh, beautiful</i>

453
00:44:37.237 --> 00:44:39.728
<i>For spacious skies</i>

454
00:44:39.807 --> 00:44:43.903
<i>For amber waves of grain</i>

455
00:44:43.979 --> 00:44:49.315
<i>For purple mountains majesty</i>

456
00:44:49.385 --> 00:44:53.617
<i>Above the fruited plain</i>

457
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.954
<i>America--</i>

458
00:45:33.706 --> 00:45:35.674
Don't cry!

459
00:45:35.742 --> 00:45:37.676
Hold it back!

460
00:45:40.715 --> 00:45:42.979
Let it turn to something else.

461
00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:48.456
Just let it turn to
something else, okay?

462
00:45:54.966 --> 00:45:56.900
Listen to me. Listen.

463
00:45:58.036 --> 00:46:01.904
Don't you ever cry again
as long as you live.

464
00:46:01.975 --> 00:46:04.273
As long as you live,
never do it.

465
00:46:04.344 --> 00:46:05.936
Do you hear me?

466
00:46:16.292 --> 00:46:18.283
They're gonna kill us!

467
00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:20.124
All of us!

468
00:46:20.197 --> 00:46:22.791
So why should we be different?

469
00:46:28.574 --> 00:46:31.270
Let it turn to
something else, Mattie.

470
00:46:31.343 --> 00:46:33.868
Let it turn.
Let it turn.

471
00:47:02.883 --> 00:47:04.874
Take gasoline.

472
00:47:11.325 --> 00:47:14.419
Hey, girl,
what are you doing here?

473
00:47:14.496 --> 00:47:17.090
Hey, beautiful,
where are you going?

474
00:47:18.234 --> 00:47:21.169
Forget the broad,
just get her stuff.

475
00:47:25.377 --> 00:47:27.538
Where are you going?

476
00:47:27.612 --> 00:47:31.070
You're so beautiful.
Wait, what's wrong with you?

477
00:47:41.296 --> 00:47:42.729
Let's get her!

478
00:48:06.127 --> 00:48:07.924
Run! This way!

479
00:48:45.808 --> 00:48:47.571
Wolverines!

480
00:48:51.248 --> 00:48:53.341
It's cut...it's cut!

481
00:49:53.559 --> 00:49:55.812
I've seen this before.

482
00:49:56.962 --> 00:49:59.556
Nicaragua, El Salvador...

483
00:49:59.633 --> 00:50:03.797
Cambodia, Angola, and Mexico.

484
00:50:05.072 --> 00:50:07.370
But these are my men!

485
00:50:21.259 --> 00:50:23.750
Miss, maybe you speak at me
for a minute.

486
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:27.526
- I'll be right back, okay?
- You bring girlfriend?

487
00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.296
Okay, I be right here. Bye.

488
00:50:32.106 --> 00:50:34.267
What is a "Wolverine"?

489
00:50:34.342 --> 00:50:39.780
A small animal...like a badger,
but terribly ferocious.

490
00:50:39.848 --> 00:50:44.615
It is also the name of the local
school sports collective.

491
00:50:44.688 --> 00:50:46.417
They're beasts, Ernesto.

492
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:50.517
You must kill
every one of them eventually.

493
00:50:50.595 --> 00:50:54.190
It's the same as Afghanistan.

494
00:50:54.267 --> 00:50:56.667
They'll never stop.

495
00:50:56.736 --> 00:51:01.764
Look...I was always
on the side of the insurgents.

496
00:51:01.842 --> 00:51:04.504
I have no experience
in these matters.

497
00:51:04.579 --> 00:51:09.414
But it would seem necessary
to win the support of the people.

498
00:51:09.485 --> 00:51:13.421
As our opponents
used to say in Vietnam:

499
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:16.516
"Win their hearts and minds."

500
00:51:16.594 --> 00:51:18.960
And they lost, Ernesto.

501
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:20.793
Of course, General.

502
00:51:20.866 --> 00:51:24.996
Things are paralyzed
at the front, Ernesto.

503
00:51:25.071 --> 00:51:28.302
Morale is crucial right now.

504
00:51:28.375 --> 00:51:31.242
Keep the men in the secured areas.

505
00:51:31.312 --> 00:51:35.214
You'll see how they forget
about these "Wolverines."

506
00:51:38.554 --> 00:51:40.249
Are you all right?

507
00:51:43.394 --> 00:51:46.090
- You were saying, comrade?
- Shut up!

508
00:52:02.049 --> 00:52:04.847
What's going on here?!

509
00:52:07.289 --> 00:52:09.985
NOVEMBER

510
00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.143
You American?

511
00:53:25.452 --> 00:53:27.079
Red-blooded.

512
00:53:27.154 --> 00:53:30.089
Yeah, well,
what's the capital of Texas?

513
00:53:30.893 --> 00:53:32.114
Austin.

514
00:53:32.314 --> 00:53:34.326
Wrong, commie!
It's Houston!

515
00:53:34.396 --> 00:53:37.593
Please, darling.
I'm cold.

516
00:53:39.637 --> 00:53:41.901
You've seen too many movies.

517
00:53:49.515 --> 00:53:51.676
Well, are you hungry?

518
00:53:53.253 --> 00:53:54.686
I could eat, yeah.

519
00:53:54.755 --> 00:53:57.019
What kind of plane you fly?

520
00:53:58.526 --> 00:54:00.790
well, I did fly an F-15.

521
00:54:07.137 --> 00:54:09.071
I'm an Eagle driver.

522
00:54:15.147 --> 00:54:17.342
Here, take this.

523
00:54:17.416 --> 00:54:20.476
I got this off
a dead Russian major.

524
00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.154
Major, huh?

525
00:54:24.358 --> 00:54:26.622
Well, I guess
it oughta fit on a colonel.

526
00:54:34.403 --> 00:54:36.837
You the honcho, sport?

527
00:54:36.907 --> 00:54:38.932
Who are you?

528
00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:41.739
Andrew Tanner,
Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Air Force.

529
00:54:41.813 --> 00:54:44.077
How'd you get yourself
shot down, Colonel?

530
00:54:44.148 --> 00:54:46.673
It was five to one.
I got four.

531
00:54:51.424 --> 00:54:54.655
- I'm Jed.
- How you doing, Jed?

532
00:54:54.729 --> 00:54:56.663
Good as can be.

533
00:55:08.912 --> 00:55:12.973
West coast... east coast.

534
00:55:13.051 --> 00:55:14.985
Down here is Mexico.

535
00:55:16.122 --> 00:55:18.113
The first wave of the attack...

536
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:22.490
came in disguised as commercial charter
flights, like Afghanistan in '80.

537
00:55:22.562 --> 00:55:25.292
only they were
crack airborne outfits.

538
00:55:25.366 --> 00:55:28.267
They took these passes
in the Rockies.

539
00:55:28.336 --> 00:55:30.099
So that's what hit Calumet.

540
00:55:30.172 --> 00:55:32.037
I guess so.

541
00:55:32.107 --> 00:55:35.770
They coordinated with nuke strikes,
using surprisingly accurate missiles.

542
00:55:35.845 --> 00:55:39.611
They took out the silos in the Dakotas
and key points of communication.

543
00:55:39.684 --> 00:55:41.345
Like what?

544
00:55:41.419 --> 00:55:45.082
Oh, like Omaha, Washington,
Kansas City.

545
00:55:45.157 --> 00:55:46.089
Gone?

546
00:55:46.159 --> 00:55:48.093
Yeah, that's right.

547
00:55:48.161 --> 00:55:51.892
Infiltrators came up illegal
from Mexico.

548
00:55:51.965 --> 00:55:53.557
Cubans, mostly.

549
00:55:53.634 --> 00:55:55.397
They managed to infiltrate...

550
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:58.268
SAC bases in the midwest,
several down in Texas...

551
00:55:58.339 --> 00:56:00.899
and wreaked a hell of a lot of havoc,
I'm here to tell you.

552
00:56:00.976 --> 00:56:04.241
They opened up the door down here...

553
00:56:04.314 --> 00:56:06.680
and the whole Cuban
and Nicaraguan armies...

554
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:09.048
come walking right through...

555
00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:11.486
rolled right up here
through the Great Plains.

556
00:56:11.556 --> 00:56:13.319
How far did they get?

557
00:56:13.392 --> 00:56:15.417
Cheyenne...

558
00:56:15.494 --> 00:56:17.894
across to Kansas.

559
00:56:17.964 --> 00:56:21.422
We held them at the Rockies
and at the Mississippi.

560
00:56:21.502 --> 00:56:25.768
Anyway, the Russians reinforced
with 60 divisions.

561
00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:29.470
Sent three whole army groups
across the Bering Strait into Alaska...

562
00:56:29.544 --> 00:56:31.842
cut the pipeline,
came across Canada...

563
00:56:31.914 --> 00:56:35.350
to link up here in the middle,
but we stopped their butt cold.

564
00:56:39.657 --> 00:56:43.286
The lines have
pretty much stabilized now.

565
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:46.063
What about Europe?

566
00:56:46.132 --> 00:56:48.225
I guess they figured...

567
00:56:49.636 --> 00:56:52.070
twice in one century was enough.

568
00:56:56.278 --> 00:56:59.805
They're sitting this one out.
all except England.

569
00:57:01.217 --> 00:57:04.243
And they won't last very long.

570
00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:08.222
The Russians need to take us in one
piece, and that's why they're here now.

571
00:57:08.292 --> 00:57:11.318
That's why they won't use nukes anymore
and we won't either.

572
00:57:11.396 --> 00:57:14.365
The whole damn thing's
pretty conventional now.

573
00:57:15.501 --> 00:57:19.528
Who knows?
Maybe next week will be swords.

574
00:57:19.606 --> 00:57:21.267
What started it?

575
00:57:21.341 --> 00:57:25.607
I don't know.
Two toughest kids on the block, I guess.

576
00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.614
Sooner or later,
they're gonna fight.

577
00:57:27.683 --> 00:57:29.674
That simple?

578
00:57:32.022 --> 00:57:34.456
Maybe somebody just
forgot what it was like.

579
00:57:35.993 --> 00:57:37.927
Well, who is on our side?

580
00:57:39.531 --> 00:57:41.931
Six hundred million
screaming Chinamen.

581
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.128
Last I heard, there were
a billion screaming Chinamen.

582
00:57:46.339 --> 00:57:47.601
There were.

583
00:57:53.682 --> 00:57:55.115
You got a family?

584
00:57:59.856 --> 00:58:01.483
I don't know.

585
00:58:04.328 --> 00:58:07.855
They got caught
behind the lines down in Texas.

586
00:58:10.236 --> 00:58:13.205
I'd like to think
they're alive, but...

587
00:58:13.272 --> 00:58:16.207
I hear stories about
what they're doing to civilians.

588
00:58:21.949 --> 00:58:23.974
Colonel, get up.

589
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:27.288
We're gonna go shoot up
an armored column.

590
00:58:29.859 --> 00:58:32.123
Let's go.
The early bird gets the worm.

591
00:58:45.679 --> 00:58:47.647
Early bird gets the worm.

592
00:59:16.116 --> 00:59:18.243
Watch those claymores in the trees.

593
00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:30.093
Matt, RPG!

594
00:59:42.615 --> 00:59:45.641
What do you think?
Not bad for a bunch of kids, huh?

595
00:59:47.321 --> 00:59:49.448
Your mom would be real proud.

596
00:59:55.965 --> 00:59:59.901
You think you're tough
for eating beans every day?

597
00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:03.929
The scarecrows in Denver would give
anything for a taste of what you got.

598
01:00:05.844 --> 01:00:08.779
They've been under siege
for about three months.

599
01:00:10.116 --> 01:00:13.608
They live off rats
and sawdust bread and sometimes...

600
01:00:13.687 --> 01:00:15.655
on each other.

601
01:00:19.327 --> 01:00:21.989
At night, the...

602
01:00:22.064 --> 01:00:24.362
pyres for the dead
light up the sky.

603
01:00:27.037 --> 01:00:28.971
It's medieval.

604
01:00:50.031 --> 01:00:51.965
All that hate's
gonna burn you up.

605
01:00:53.469 --> 01:00:55.403
It keeps me warm.

606
01:01:07.786 --> 01:01:09.754
Are we doing right?

607
01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:00.841
You made a new friend.

608
01:02:05.558 --> 01:02:07.492
She doesn't say much, does she?

609
01:02:10.964 --> 01:02:12.898
Something happened to her.

610
01:02:20.576 --> 01:02:23.238
DECEMBER

611
01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:35.688
All right.
Plane, plane, plane, plane.

612
01:02:35.761 --> 01:02:40.198
Cuban bunker, Russian bunker,
munitions dump, troop tents.

613
01:02:40.267 --> 01:02:43.430
Machine gun bunkers
here, here, here and here.

614
01:02:43.504 --> 01:02:47.167
<i>Back here by the drive-in screen
are your political prisoners.</i>

615
01:02:47.242 --> 01:02:49.267
<i>We'll cause a diversion over here...</i>

616
01:02:49.345 --> 01:02:53.441
<i>cut holes in the wire here,
fire on all these machine gun positions.</i>

617
01:02:53.517 --> 01:02:57.351
The B Group comes across this area
in a flanking maneuver...

618
01:02:57.421 --> 01:03:01.687
and when you reach this bunker, you
lay down grazing fire in this defilade.

619
01:03:02.595 --> 01:03:05.155
I think that's pretty simple.

620
01:03:05.231 --> 01:03:06.926
Anybody got any questions so far?

621
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.831
What's a flank?

622
01:03:08.902 --> 01:03:10.893
A duffle-A?

623
01:03:11.973 --> 01:03:15.238
- What's grazing fire?
- I need a drink.

624
01:03:16.511 --> 01:03:18.206
Step into the line--

625
01:03:33.699 --> 01:03:37.863
Help...the "Wolverines" are attacking.

626
01:03:37.938 --> 01:03:39.371
Follow me...quickly.

627
01:03:42.644 --> 01:03:44.077
Wolverines!

628
01:04:10.944 --> 01:04:12.912
Come on! Here's your chance!

629
01:04:12.981 --> 01:04:15.916
We're all gonna die!
Die standing up!

630
01:04:27.999 --> 01:04:29.261
Grenade!

631
01:05:07.881 --> 01:05:10.543
Children did this.

632
01:05:10.618 --> 01:05:12.142
It's rebels.

633
01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:15.280
What rebels? They're bandits.

634
01:05:18.661 --> 01:05:21.789
Every time they shoot,
the revolution grows.

635
01:05:21.866 --> 01:05:24.562
I know. I was a partisan.

636
01:05:25.336 --> 01:05:28.430
And what are you now?

637
01:05:30.142 --> 01:05:32.076
Now I'm like you...

638
01:05:33.312 --> 01:05:35.075
a policeman.

639
01:05:41.156 --> 01:05:42.680
All right, Colonel!

640
01:05:47.998 --> 01:05:51.126
And he's down.
Great play by Matt Eckert.

641
01:05:54.539 --> 01:05:56.803
Huddle up, folks.

642
01:05:56.875 --> 01:06:00.470
- That was a pretty big hit.
- You cover Matt this play.

643
01:06:00.546 --> 01:06:02.241
Are you okay?

644
01:06:05.853 --> 01:06:08.014
A little harder
down on the ground, isn't it?

645
01:06:09.223 --> 01:06:11.384
Come on, old man.

646
01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.394
Well, you come down here.

647
01:06:18.402 --> 01:06:23.035
How old's your wife?

648
01:06:23.107 --> 01:06:24.665
Eighty.

649
01:06:25.443 --> 01:06:27.001
What's she like?

650
01:06:27.079 --> 01:06:29.377
Old, like me.

651
01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:31.040
What's she really like?

652
01:06:32.652 --> 01:06:35.348
Feisty, like you.

653
01:06:40.062 --> 01:06:41.620
Where'd you meet her?

654
01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:44.131
You really want to know this stuff?

655
01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:48.827
I met her in a closet at a party.

656
01:06:48.906 --> 01:06:51.374
I couldn't stand her at first.

657
01:06:51.442 --> 01:06:53.376
But once it took...

658
01:06:54.479 --> 01:06:56.743
I loved her so bad it hurt.

659
01:06:58.351 --> 01:07:00.615
You still love her like that?

660
01:07:03.457 --> 01:07:05.220
Are you quitters playing or what?

661
01:07:07.462 --> 01:07:08.724
Fine.

662
01:07:09.597 --> 01:07:11.531
Good catch, Robert.

663
01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.534
Matt, let's go!

664
01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:17.268
They brought their kids.

665
01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:20.832
Said they didn't have food enough
to feed them through the winter.

666
01:07:20.912 --> 01:07:23.813
They want to give them to you, Jed.

667
01:07:23.882 --> 01:07:26.476
This is enough, Mr. Mason.
I don't want any more.

668
01:07:27.686 --> 01:07:31.986
You're a leader now.
They've heard of you on the other side.

669
01:07:32.058 --> 01:07:34.492
Maybe all the way to California.

670
01:07:35.596 --> 01:07:37.530
And there's some that say...

671
01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:40.727
they're gonna drop in some Special
Forces in the spring to help you out.

672
01:07:43.139 --> 01:07:44.470
Green Berets.

673
01:07:50.214 --> 01:07:52.648
Spring's a long time away.

674
01:07:54.253 --> 01:07:56.517
It's a lot of talk until then.

675
01:07:57.957 --> 01:08:00.482
JANUARY

676
01:08:23.588 --> 01:08:26.113
It's ours! It's ours!

677
01:08:26.192 --> 01:08:27.557
How can you tell?

678
01:08:28.461 --> 01:08:29.519
It's ours.

679
01:08:37.038 --> 01:08:38.300
Fry 'em.

680
01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:16.451
Jesus.

681
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:21.524
You gotta cross that?

682
01:09:22.995 --> 01:09:24.428
Just part of it.

683
01:09:25.464 --> 01:09:27.728
I hope our guys are still there.

684
01:09:31.338 --> 01:09:33.272
So this is the battlefield?

685
01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:38.874
<i>It's a real war, kid.
It's here every day.</i>

686
01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:42.642
Come with me, Jed.

687
01:09:45.122 --> 01:09:47.056
You can quit now.

688
01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.887
Could you?

689
01:09:50.962 --> 01:09:53.021
Don't give me that crap.

690
01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.634
Wake up in the morning...

691
01:09:56.703 --> 01:09:58.364
grow old.

692
01:10:03.511 --> 01:10:05.672
Move it!
Come on! Let's go!

693
01:10:14.792 --> 01:10:17.352
Get down!
Down! Down! Down!

694
01:10:27.541 --> 01:10:29.475
Stay down! He can't see us!

695
01:10:51.570 --> 01:10:53.800
He's looking for us!

696
01:10:56.075 --> 01:10:57.508
He sure is.

697
01:11:03.084 --> 01:11:06.212
I can't stand it!
I can't stand it!

698
01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:09.021
Get down!

699
01:11:09.091 --> 01:11:11.025
Shut up!

700
01:11:25.545 --> 01:11:27.877
Run! Everybody get outta here!

701
01:11:27.949 --> 01:11:30.577
What are you doing?
Goddammit!

702
01:11:34.756 --> 01:11:36.451
I'm going up there!

703
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:47.904
I got it!

704
01:11:49.174 --> 01:11:52.075
Get outta here, kid!
There's a world of hurt coming down!

705
01:11:52.144 --> 01:11:54.078
I'm staying with you, Colonel!

706
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.454
Take him out with your RPG!

707
01:12:01.522 --> 01:12:04.889
- It won't launch!
- Get another rocket!

708
01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:09.498
Give me another rocket!

709
01:12:20.346 --> 01:12:21.472
Aardvark!

710
01:12:30.659 --> 01:12:32.251
Eat me!

711
01:12:57.591 --> 01:13:00.116
Come on, buddies!
Come and get 'em!

712
01:13:02.064 --> 01:13:05.431
Shoot straight, for once...

713
01:13:05.501 --> 01:13:08.902
you Army...pukes.

714
01:13:13.712 --> 01:13:16.647
It's useless! He's dead!
Let's go!

715
01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.666
I'll never love anybody.

716
01:14:01.737 --> 01:14:04.934
I'll never love anybody again.

717
01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:09.936
If you didn't love anybody,
you'd never even be here.

718
01:14:16.088 --> 01:14:18.113
Where we gonna bury him?

719
01:14:19.192 --> 01:14:21.387
There's not much left to bury.

720
01:14:27.536 --> 01:14:30.027
These were good friends.

721
01:14:30.105 --> 01:14:33.233
Take them away from here...

722
01:14:33.309 --> 01:14:35.903
someplace safe...

723
01:14:35.979 --> 01:14:38.573
where this world's never happened.

724
01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:42.619
And as we remember...

725
01:14:43.721 --> 01:14:46.281
please let them forget, O Lord...

726
01:14:50.564 --> 01:14:52.964
so they can be little again.

727
01:15:08.919 --> 01:15:11.285
What are you whispering for?

728
01:15:11.356 --> 01:15:13.756
It feels quiet.

729
01:15:13.825 --> 01:15:16.817
You should get some sleep.
It's getting late.

730
01:15:16.896 --> 01:15:18.261
I'm okay.

731
01:15:25.073 --> 01:15:27.007
It's kind of strange, isn't it?

732
01:15:27.075 --> 01:15:29.805
How the mountains
pay us no attention at all.

733
01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.848
You laugh or you cry...

734
01:15:32.916 --> 01:15:35.476
the wind just keeps on blowing.

735
01:15:40.893 --> 01:15:43.453
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

736
01:15:44.596 --> 01:15:47.360
You're getting pretty lean
on feelings, aren't you?

737
01:15:47.433 --> 01:15:49.526
I can't afford them.

738
01:15:49.603 --> 01:15:51.935
Even if that had been me?

739
01:15:55.944 --> 01:15:58.310
I was talking to the group, Jed.

740
01:15:58.381 --> 01:16:00.815
It doesn't look good.
They're all talking about quitting.

741
01:16:00.883 --> 01:16:04.944
It seems like they lost stomach for it,
except for Robert.

742
01:16:06.958 --> 01:16:08.619
And you?

743
01:16:08.693 --> 01:16:12.094
I'm your brother.
Just make it count.

744
01:16:16.303 --> 01:16:18.965
FEBRUARY

745
01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:18.505
Attention!

746
01:17:29.826 --> 01:17:32.158
Be seated, comrades.

747
01:17:38.837 --> 01:17:41.465
What I despise most
about warfare...

748
01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:44.134
is the hypocrisy it often breeds.

749
01:17:44.210 --> 01:17:47.873
I've heard euphemisms
that we are containing the enemy...

750
01:17:47.948 --> 01:17:51.884
that our sector
of pacification is growing.

751
01:17:52.688 --> 01:17:54.815
These are the tactics of the lie.

752
01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:58.485
Lies have the stench
of death and defeat.

753
01:18:01.465 --> 01:18:04.263
You can only win a war...

754
01:18:04.335 --> 01:18:07.566
by exterminating the enemy.

755
01:18:09.275 --> 01:18:11.869
Do you know who we are fighting?

756
01:18:14.214 --> 01:18:17.308
We are fighting Wolverines...

757
01:18:18.553 --> 01:18:21.488
small, ferocious animals.

758
01:18:22.524 --> 01:18:25.584
For them, you need a hunter.

759
01:18:25.661 --> 01:18:28.027
And you know...

760
01:18:28.098 --> 01:18:29.861
I am a hunter.

761
01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:37.638
From this moment on...

762
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:42.476
there will be no further
reprisals against civilians.

763
01:18:42.548 --> 01:18:44.573
This was stupid.

764
01:18:47.287 --> 01:18:49.312
Impotence.

765
01:18:52.862 --> 01:18:54.693
Comrades...

766
01:18:54.764 --> 01:18:58.791
if a fox stole your chickens...

767
01:18:58.869 --> 01:19:03.397
would you slaughter your pig
because he saw the fox? No.

768
01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:07.473
You would hunt the fox...

769
01:19:07.546 --> 01:19:12.313
find where it lives
and destroy it!

770
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:18.959
And how do we do this?

771
01:19:21.263 --> 01:19:23.493
Become a fox.

772
01:21:44.572 --> 01:21:47.234
Danny, your bolt's open.
It's jammed.

773
01:21:58.189 --> 01:22:00.123
So what if he does?
You don't.

774
01:22:00.192 --> 01:22:02.126
We'd better get out of here.

775
01:22:03.228 --> 01:22:04.490
Shoot him!

776
01:22:04.564 --> 01:22:07.556
- What is this thing?
- What is it?

777
01:22:07.634 --> 01:22:10.330
Who's coming after us?
Where are they?

778
01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:15.306
Rub a butt on him.

779
01:22:16.778 --> 01:22:19.042
Suck at you!
Goddamn for your mother!

780
01:22:19.115 --> 01:22:23.381
I hear a chopper, and I'm
going to blow your brains out.

781
01:22:23.453 --> 01:22:26.149
Go die, Yankee. Die.

782
01:22:27.291 --> 01:22:29.851
Gorsky, Stepan Yevgenyvitch.

783
01:22:29.927 --> 01:22:32.418
No one gives a damn who you are!

784
01:22:32.498 --> 01:22:34.398
- They're gonna hurt him!
- Good!

785
01:22:34.466 --> 01:22:36.331
Hey! Look!

786
01:22:37.303 --> 01:22:40.966
This thing's got an arrow.
It's pointing.

787
01:22:41.042 --> 01:22:42.475
Where?

788
01:22:44.813 --> 01:22:46.838
Right here.

789
01:23:05.405 --> 01:23:07.100
Where is it?

790
01:23:08.208 --> 01:23:09.937
Where is it?

791
01:23:10.778 --> 01:23:12.871
Goddammit, where's the bug?

792
01:23:12.947 --> 01:23:16.314
- They made me swallow it.
- Daryl, what have you done?

793
01:23:16.385 --> 01:23:18.649
I went into town.

794
01:23:18.722 --> 01:23:22.954
And got caught?
And went and got caught?

795
01:23:23.027 --> 01:23:24.517
Why?

796
01:23:24.595 --> 01:23:26.927
Because you said we couldn't.

797
01:23:26.997 --> 01:23:30.125
You told them where we were,
didn't you?

798
01:23:30.202 --> 01:23:31.965
You told them!

799
01:23:33.106 --> 01:23:35.040
My father turned me in.

800
01:23:37.144 --> 01:23:39.578
Oh, God, they did things
you can't imagine.

801
01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:47.982
You son of a bitch!

802
01:23:49.993 --> 01:23:51.927
You want blindfolds?

803
01:23:51.995 --> 01:23:55.761
- This violates the Geneva Convention.
- I never heard of it!

804
01:23:55.833 --> 01:23:58.495
Dog face!
I show you how Soviet dies!

805
01:23:58.570 --> 01:24:00.629
I've seen it before, pal.

806
01:24:00.706 --> 01:24:02.537
This isn't happening!

807
01:24:02.609 --> 01:24:03.974
Jed, let him go!

808
01:24:04.043 --> 01:24:06.102
- Shut up, Danny!
- He was one of us!

809
01:24:06.179 --> 01:24:07.544
Shut up!

810
01:24:07.615 --> 01:24:09.515
He told them where we were!

811
01:24:10.719 --> 01:24:13.688
He did.
Now get your rifles.

812
01:24:16.125 --> 01:24:19.356
- What did you say?
- I said no! We're not doing it!

813
01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:23.627
Boy, say at me you are friend,
so I will not die alone.

814
01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:25.793
What's the difference, Jed?

815
01:24:25.870 --> 01:24:28.168
- I'll do it.
- Shut up, Robert!

816
01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.868
Tell me what's the difference
between us and them!

817
01:24:36.783 --> 01:24:39.479
Because we live here.

818
01:24:45.027 --> 01:24:47.018
Don't shoot me.
Don't shoot.

819
01:24:47.096 --> 01:24:49.860
Don't shoot, Jed.
Don't shoot, Jed.

820
01:28:22.027 --> 01:28:24.962
How many of those you got left?

821
01:28:25.031 --> 01:28:26.123
Four.

822
01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:31.135
Ready...

823
01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:36.975
No, wait. Stop.

824
01:28:46.591 --> 01:28:49.219
What do you say?
You hungry?

825
01:29:03.478 --> 01:29:04.911
Go, Toni.

826
01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:23.808
Let's get it fast
and get back to the rock.

827
01:30:25.178 --> 01:30:26.668
Come on.

828
01:30:51.543 --> 01:30:53.477
It's been so long.

829
01:31:22.449 --> 01:31:24.110
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

830
01:31:44.343 --> 01:31:45.776
Oh, my God!

831
01:31:47.479 --> 01:31:49.071
Holy shit!

832
01:31:52.485 --> 01:31:53.918
Stay down!

833
01:32:00.995 --> 01:32:03.862
Get on your horses!
Let's get out of here!

834
01:32:08.972 --> 01:32:11.907
Erica, come on! Get on!

835
01:32:14.145 --> 01:32:16.579
Let's go! Let's go!

836
01:32:51.024 --> 01:32:53.356
Go on! Go on!

837
01:34:45.531 --> 01:34:47.158
Wolverines!

838
01:35:42.334 --> 01:35:44.029
I'm killed, Jed.

839
01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:52.401
Don't let them get me,
because they'll make me talk.

840
01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:04.925
Where's a gun?

841
01:36:07.565 --> 01:36:09.430
I want you to do it.

842
01:36:27.489 --> 01:36:28.922
I can't.

843
01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.890
I can't, Toni.
I can't.

844
01:36:32.963 --> 01:36:34.555
It's okay.

845
01:36:39.871 --> 01:36:41.361
Give me a grenade.

846
01:36:44.978 --> 01:36:47.446
I don't wanna be too cold.

847
01:36:57.159 --> 01:36:59.093
Pull the pin for me.

848
01:37:09.575 --> 01:37:11.167
Go.

849
01:37:11.244 --> 01:37:14.771
I'm just gonna stay here...

850
01:37:14.848 --> 01:37:17.442
and listen to the
wind awhile, okay?

851
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:22.622
Now go.

852
01:38:44.692 --> 01:38:46.626
Comrade Colonel.

853
01:38:50.398 --> 01:38:54.494
I would estimate
the enemy body count at...

854
01:38:56.106 --> 01:38:57.539
Twelve.

855
01:38:58.475 --> 01:39:00.602
wouldn't you agree?

856
01:39:01.813 --> 01:39:03.246
Twelve?

857
01:39:04.516 --> 01:39:06.006
Twelve?

858
01:39:09.823 --> 01:39:12.815
I saw only one.

859
01:39:15.897 --> 01:39:18.365
But they carry off their dead.

860
01:39:18.433 --> 01:39:20.765
Of course. Why not?

861
01:39:24.607 --> 01:39:26.575
What do you think?

862
01:40:09.395 --> 01:40:11.659
All right, now listen to me.

863
01:40:11.732 --> 01:40:14.701
You two are gonna wait up here
until the troops pull back into town.

864
01:40:14.769 --> 01:40:18.466
You'll know when that happens.
When they do, head out for the plains.

865
01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:19.802
What about you?

866
01:40:19.875 --> 01:40:22.241
I gotta stick around...

867
01:40:22.311 --> 01:40:24.575
and stir things up a little
bit so you can make it out.

868
01:40:24.648 --> 01:40:26.240
We're going with you, Mattie.

869
01:40:26.316 --> 01:40:28.250
Will you listen to me?

870
01:40:29.554 --> 01:40:31.488
We're all that's left.

871
01:40:31.556 --> 01:40:34.525
Somebody's gotta live.
Somebody's gotta make it.

872
01:40:40.568 --> 01:40:42.502
Me and Jed, we're all used up.

873
01:40:54.885 --> 01:40:56.819
I'm never gonna forget...

874
01:40:57.856 --> 01:41:00.051
as long as I live.

875
01:41:06.032 --> 01:41:07.465
Don't.

876
01:41:14.976 --> 01:41:16.910
You're never gonna know who won.

877
01:41:19.381 --> 01:41:21.110
Who will?

878
01:41:23.486 --> 01:41:27.650
We could make it, Jed.
We've done a lot tougher than this.

879
01:41:27.725 --> 01:41:31.786
We could cause a diversion,
get out, head back to the mountains.

880
01:41:35.902 --> 01:41:37.335
I love you, Mattie.

881
01:41:40.074 --> 01:41:41.769
I know.

882
01:41:41.843 --> 01:41:44.107
I love you too, Jed.

883
01:42:06.739 --> 01:42:08.673
It's hard being brothers,
isn't it?

884
01:42:25.597 --> 01:42:26.689
Let's go.

885
01:42:32.771 --> 01:42:36.400
<i>I can't remember
what it was to be warm.</i>

886
01:42:38.246 --> 01:42:43.445
<i>It seems a thousand years
since I was a small boy in the sun.</i>

887
01:42:45.154 --> 01:42:48.681
<i>How did I come to this high,
desolate place...</i>

888
01:42:49.792 --> 01:42:52.192
<i>where there is
nothing but loneliness?</i>

889
01:42:55.199 --> 01:42:56.860
<i>So much is lost.</i>

890
01:42:58.503 --> 01:43:02.667
<i>I want to look into
your eyes and forget.</i>

891
01:43:04.711 --> 01:43:07.976
<i>It all seems so far away...</i>

892
01:43:08.048 --> 01:43:12.712
<i>a warm house
where my shadow never falls...</i>

893
01:43:14.056 --> 01:43:18.356
<i>your long, black hair in my hands.</i>

894
01:43:21.031 --> 01:43:23.932
<i>There is no more revolution...</i>

895
01:43:24.001 --> 01:43:26.561
<i>only you to come back to.</i>

896
01:43:27.839 --> 01:43:30.103
<i>I will post my resignation.</i>

897
01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:51.535
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

898
01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:33.123
They're attacking the station.

899
01:45:35.863 --> 01:45:38.127
Everybody to the station.

900
01:46:05.333 --> 01:46:07.494
Hurry! Hurry!

901
01:47:12.448 --> 01:47:14.380
You lose.

902
01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:05.591
Go with god.

903
01:48:20.499 --> 01:48:22.467
You can rest now.

904
01:48:26.172 --> 01:48:28.106
Just hang on, Mattie.

905
01:48:32.747 --> 01:48:36.148
Oh, Mattie.
It's okay, Mattie. It's okay.

906
01:48:36.218 --> 01:48:40.314
Just hang on, Mattie.
Daddy'll be here soon, Mattie.

907
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:42.324
Hang on, Mattie.

908
01:48:44.929 --> 01:48:47.921
Come on, Mattie.
Daddy'll be here soon.

909
01:48:58.613 --> 01:49:00.547
Come on, Mattie.

910
01:49:08.024 --> 01:49:12.427
I'll hold you as long as I can, Mattie.
I'll hold you as long as I can.

911
01:49:12.496 --> 01:49:14.293
You can lean on me.

912
01:49:18.203 --> 01:49:20.137
I'm so tired.

913
01:49:23.710 --> 01:49:25.541
I'm so tired.

914
01:50:06.228 --> 01:50:07.661
We're free now.

915
01:50:09.166 --> 01:50:10.599
Free.

916
01:50:24.719 --> 01:50:27.017
<i>I never saw the brothers again.</i>

917
01:50:27.088 --> 01:50:31.354
<i>In time, this war,
like every other war, ended.</i>

918
01:50:31.426 --> 01:50:33.121
<i>But I never forgot.</i>

919
01:50:33.195 --> 01:50:37.222
<i>And I come to this place often,
when no one else does.</i>

920
01:50:39.303 --> 01:50:42.033
<i>"In the early days
of World War III...</i>

921
01:50:42.107 --> 01:50:45.304
<i>guerrillas, mostly children...</i>

922
01:50:45.376 --> 01:50:48.675
<i>placed the names of their lost
upon this rock.</i>

923
01:50:48.748 --> 01:50:52.844
<i>They fought here alone
and gave up their lives...</i>

924
01:50:52.919 --> 01:50:56.548
<i>so that this nation
shall not perish from the earth."</i>
