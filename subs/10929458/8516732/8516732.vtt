00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
<i>Dad?</i>

2
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.400
<i>Yes, Anna?</i>

3
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.000
<i>Can you tell me</i>
<i>a scary story?</i>

4
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.200
- Once upon a time,

5
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.100
there was a little girl
called... Anna.

6
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.500
And she lived in
a big house in the countryside.

7
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.600
One dark and very creepy night,
she was asleep in bed.

8
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.400
All of a sudden, she woke up.

9
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.200
From downstairs,
she heard a noise,

10
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.300
the floorboards creaking.

11
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.100
Creak, creak, creak.

12
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.800
And then a voice began talking.

13
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.300
"Anna!

14
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.100
"Anna!

15
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.300
I'm coming to get you."

16
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
Then silence.

17
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.300
- What happened?

18
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.300
- Beneath the blanket,
Anna heard breathing.

19
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.800
She felt
the thing moving closer.

20
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.200
Long fingers on the blanket.

21
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.200
And when Anna thought
she couldn't take anymore,

22
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.500
the voice said...

23
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.300
"I'm right here,

24
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.600
"and I've...

25
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.700
got you!"

26
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.600
That was a good one.

27
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.500
- Okay you, time to sleep.

28
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.600
Nana's going to bed too,
so no wandering around, okay?

29
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.700
Okay.

30
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.400
- Lights on or off?

31
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.800
- On.

32
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.200
- Sleep tight.

33
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.500
- Don't let the bed bugs bite.

34
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.200
- Dad?

35
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.200
Dad?

36
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.700
Daddy? Nana?

37
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.900
Anna!

38
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.000
I thought I heard the door.
It's so lovely to see you.

39
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.800
- Yeah and you.

40
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.500
- That's one of you
nan's favorites.

41
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.600
- Yeah mine, too.

42
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.500
- So, so sorry to
hear about your dad.

43
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.800
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.
- I so enjoyed his visits.

44
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.100
Your nan loved him being here.

45
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.700
Such a lovely, lovely guy.

46
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.200
- Yeah, he really was.

47
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.100
- How was the journey?

48
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.000
- Yeah, lovely, fine, yeah.

49
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.900
- Oh, good.

50
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.500
- Wow, this place never changes.

51
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.000
- I know. I know.

52
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.300
Well, she's so
excited to see you.

53
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.900
Lucy.

54
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.800
Lucy darling,
look who I've got here.

55
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.000
- Hey, Nan.

56
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.800
- Maggie?

57
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.600
- No, it's-it's Anna,
sweetheart.

58
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.700
It's Anna,
your gorgeous granddaughter.

59
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.900
- Anna?

60
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.100
- That's right, darling.

61
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.700
I'll go put the kettle on

62
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.500
and give you
a chance to catch up.

63
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.300
- Hi, Nan.

64
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.900
- Is Maggie here, too?

65
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.200
- No.

66
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.600
Maggie's not here.

67
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.200
It's just me.

68
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.800
- That's a shame.

69
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.600
- I'm here to look after you.

70
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.100
- Hmm.

71
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.600
- Bet you need that
after your long drive.

72
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.300
You must try not to
take it personally, Anna.

73
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.900
- Hmm.

74
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.800
She doesn't even remember me.

75
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.800
It's just that,
sometimes she's lost in the fog

76
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.300
and sometimes
she's finds her way out,

77
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.000
but she's still the same
person you grew up loving.

78
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.900
She's so happy you're here.

79
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.200
- Hmm.

80
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.700
Hmm.

81
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.900
Strange being back.

82
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.200
I have so many memories
tied to this house.

83
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.500
Hmm.

84
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.500
Hmm.

85
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.800
<i>Anna.</i>

86
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.200
Ready or not
here I come.

87
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.200
You can't hide forever.

88
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.100
I'm coming to get you.

89
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.600
I wonder where Anna is?

90
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.300
Lets get another one.
- Okay.

91
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.500
- Where could she be?

92
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.400
I wonder if she's here!

93
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.900
- You want to play another one?

94
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.900
- Yes.

95
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.100
- Ten. Nine.

96
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.000
Eight. Seven. Six. Five...

97
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.100
- It's really good you're here.

98
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.700
You know, it's important
being around family,

99
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.100
it's going to
do your gran a lot of good.

100
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.400
- Yeah, well, I hope so.

101
00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.900
- Um, and I'll be back
about ten in the morning

102
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.400
- Yeah, great.
- if that's alright with you?

103
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.100
- Alright darling, everything will be okay.
- Alright.

104
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.100
- Night, darling.
- Bye. Night.

105
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.100
- Get home safe.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

106
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.600
- You look
just like your father.

107
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.500
Same eyes.

108
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.700
You've got Harry's eyes.

109
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.000
- Have I?

110
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.500
- Where is Harry?

111
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.000
Will he be staying here, too?

112
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.000
- No, Nan.

113
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.500
He's not with us anymore.

114
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.700
- Where did he go?

115
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.600
- He's gone.

116
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.100
Dad...

117
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Harry died, Nan.

118
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.200
- Yes. No. Of course.

119
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.500
I knew that, I knew that.

120
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.200
Such a shame.

121
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.600
Lovely man.

122
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.400
Hm.

123
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.600
He used to dance with me,
insisted on it.

124
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.300
He knew how much
I enjoy dancing.

125
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.200
Lovely man.

126
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.300
- Hmm. He was.

127
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.600
- I remember the wedding.

128
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.700
Happiest day of Maggie's life.

129
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.800
Oh, they loved
each other so much.

130
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.200
- Do you remember
much about Maggie?

131
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.200
- She loved your father,

132
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.500
loved him with all her heart.

133
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.300
My Maggie.

134
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.800
How happy she was.

135
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.200
Harry danced with me
at the wedding.

136
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.700
He was always
playing the same song.

137
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.700
Erm, what was it?

138
00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.500
He played it all the time.

139
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.100
I can hear it now.

140
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.800
Ooh...

141
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:09.000
I can hear it now.
Erm, what was it called?

142
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.100
Everyone knew
it was Harry's song.

143
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.800
We danced to it together.
- Nan, it's alright.

144
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.200
- What was it? What was it?
- Nan, it's okay. Nan. Nan. Nan.

145
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.100
- What was it? What was it?
- It's okay, it's okay.

146
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.500
Nan! I know the song,
I know the song.

147
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.400
It's okay, I know the song.

148
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.700

<i>But I don't care dd</i>

152
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.800
- My Maggie.

153
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.400
- It's Anna,
not Maggie, you remember.

154
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.500
- Nonsense.

155
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.500
- Maggie died a long time ago.

156
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.700
- Go to sleep.
It's your bed time.

157
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.200
We don't want to
wake up your father

158
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.600
otherwise he'll get angry.

159
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.200
Give me a kiss then.

160
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.200
- Goodnight.

161
00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.000
Nan?

162
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.300
Nana?

163
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.400
Nan?

164
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.600
Nan?

165
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.700
Nan?

166
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:28.800
Oh, Nan.

167
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.100
Are you okay, Nan?

168
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.000
Here, let me help you up.

169
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.100
Here, hold on to me.

170
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.200
Oh, Nan.

171
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.000
- Wh... Where are we?

172
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
- We're in the kitchen, at home.

173
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.800
What you doing?

174
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.000
- I'm clearing up the mess.

175
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.000
Do I know you?

176
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.600
- I'm your granddaughter, Anna.

177
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.400
- Oh, yes. Anna.

178
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.500
She's my granddaughter.

179
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.000
Such a clever girl.

180
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.900
- Oh, Nan.

181
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.500
Let's get you back to bed, okay?

182
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.000
Hold on to me.

183
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.900
That's it, slowly.

184
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.700
<i>She's okay.</i>

185
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.700
Let her sleep a bit longer.

186
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

187
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.900
<i>She's the only</i>
<i>family I have, you know?</i>

188
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.600
I just want to keep her safe.

189
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.200
- Of course you do.

190
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.700
That's what family's all about.

191
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.800
Protecting each other.
Looking out for each other.

192
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.100
I mean, in effect
you're the parent now.

193
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.600
- Oh god, Karen.
Then we're in big trouble.

194
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.500
Oh.

195
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.100
Hey, buddy.

196
00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.900
- He won't talk to
anyone else but me.

197
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.700
Very rude.

198
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.300
I told him,
I said, "That's rude."

199
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.200
That's very rude.

200
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.700
- Morning, Nan.

201
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.300
- I didn't know.
I would've stopped it.

202
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.700
Always at night,

203
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.300
creeping around,
hidden in the shadows.

204
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.800
- Oh yeah.

205
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.300
- It's good to get
out the house for a bit.

206
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.100
What do you reckon, Nan?

207
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.300
Do you remember we used to
pick the fruit off the trees?

208
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.700
- I'm not supposed
to be out here.

209
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.300
- Yeah, course you are, Nan,
it's your garden.

210
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.800
- Oh, sweet birdies.

211
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.100
- Yeah, they're lovely.

212
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.800
- They fly wherever they want.

213
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.400
Free to see everything.

214
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.200
- Yeah, they do.

215
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.200
- Little birds.

216
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.900
- Lovely.

217
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.100
Alright, come on.

218
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.700
- Maggie loved this garden.

219
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.300
She used to play
hopscotch just over there.

220
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.800
Drew on the stones with chalk.

221
00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.200
- What was she like?
My mother?

222
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.900
- My sweet Maggie.

223
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.000
She loved your father.

224
00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.800
She would've
loved you even more.

225
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.100
When she was ten
or maybe eleven...

226
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.800
She tried to run away.

227
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.400
She was gone for a day or two,
I was worried sick.

228
00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.000
William found her,
hiding in the orchard.

229
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.400
She'd been eating the fruit.

230
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.800
William adores her.

231
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.100
- Nan. Grandad, he's--

232
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:36.500
- I wish he'd visit more often
but he's a very busy man.

233
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.300
Keeps an eye on
the house, though.

234
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.800
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

235
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:52.400
- Nan. Grandad, he's...

236
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.100
He died. Long time ago.

237
00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.800
Just after mum, when I was born.
You remember.

238
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.900
- He loved her.

239
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.400
We both did.

240
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.700
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

241
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.800
- Why?

242
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.300
- Little birds see everything.

243
00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.300
Oh... oh... oh...

244
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.100
- What is it, Nan?

245
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.400
- Look.

246
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.300
- There's nothing there, Nan.

247
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.900
- Let me
get you back inside, okay.

248
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.900
- Let's see if you're
going to work today.

249
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Ooh!

250
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.900
- <i>No, that's not fair.</i>
<i>- You said you wouldn't.</i>

251
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.200
<i>Please don't.</i>

252
00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:46.000
<i>I won't say anything.</i>
<i>I won't talk.</i>

253
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.000
<i>No!</i>

254
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.100
<i>No, you listen to me for once.</i>

255
00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.600
<i>Stay away from her.</i>

256
00:32:59.000 --> 00:32:59.800
- Ah!

257
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.300
- <i>I won't let you.</i>
<i>- You've done enough.</i>

258
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.400
<i>Leave her alone.</i>
<i>Leave her alone.</i>

259
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.100
<i>Leave her alone.</i>
<i>Leave her alone.</i>

260
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.600
- Ah, bloody thing.

261
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.000
- You didn't hear her?

262
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.400
- Hear what?

263
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.200
Anna, what's happening?

264
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.100
- What's happening?

265
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.400
- I heard her talking.

266
00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.500
- Well, she does
talk to herself sometimes.

267
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.300
- No, I mean there was
someone in here with her.

268
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.200
I heard another voice, Karen.

269
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.400
Excuse me.

270
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.200
So you didn't hear anything?

271
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.500
- Well no,
I mean I was hoovering,

272
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.000
I was trying to hoover.

273
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.400
- I just, I don't understand,

274
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.700
I heard another voice
on the receiver, I know I did.

275
00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.700
- Maybe it picked up
a radio station or something.

276
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.400
I mean, that thing's
got to be as old as the house,

277
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.400
I'm surprised it works at all.

278
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.200
- Yeah, maybe. I--

279
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.200
- And you know,
it might sound silly,

280
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.700
but the first few days in this
house are bound to be muddling.

281
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:17.100
Your gran's symptoms
can really mess with your head.

282
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.000
Yeah.

283
00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.700
Look at you you're freezing.
- Yeah.

284
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.800
- Go and get warm
and dry, darling.

285
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.600
<i>So sudden.</i>

286
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.600
At least it felt sudden.

287
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.800
But I wasn't ready
to lose Dad you know?

288
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.600
- Yeah, I know.

289
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.400
I don't think
you can ever really be ready.

290
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.800
Both my parents faded slowly
so I had ages to prepare,

291
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.700
but it's still
devastating when they die.

292
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.500
- When I was about
twelve or thirteen

293
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.700
I had this pet goldfish.

294
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.900
I begged Dad
for weeks to get one

295
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.400
and finally he gave in.

296
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.100
I called him Nibbles,

297
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.500
because he used to eat
the food out of my hand.

298
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:49.300
One day I came home
and Nibbles just seemed strange.

299
00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.500
My-- A goldfish.
It was a goldfish,

300
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.400
but something
just seemed different.

301
00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:00.400
Well, a couple of months ago,
about a week before Dad passed,

302
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.800
he told me that one day
whilst I was at school,

303
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.800
Nibbles had died.

304
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.400
He found him floating
at the top of the tank,

305
00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.200
but instead of telling me,

306
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.300
he went out
and bought another fish,

307
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.500
buried Nibbles
in the back garden,

308
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.600
covered up his death

309
00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.800
and kept it a secret from me
for over twenty years.

310
00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.900
Because he knew how
devastated I would've been.

311
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.300
- Your gran talks about
your dad all the time,

312
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.900
your mum too, actually.

313
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.600
- She keeps mistaking me
for her which is weird.

314
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:39.900
Knowing that my life
caused her death

315
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.700
has always kind of
haunted me really.

316
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.400
- No, Anna, no.

317
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.600
You can't,
you can't think of it like that.

318
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.500
- It's hard not to,
though really.

319
00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.500
- From what your
gran says to me,

320
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.400
you know, your mum and dad,

321
00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.700
they wanted you more than
anything else in the world.

322
00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.200
- Yeah.

323
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.800
- Isn't that amazing?

324
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.200
- Whenever I hear that sound
it sends a shiver down my spine.

325
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:50.500
Makes me think that Dad
is still watching over me.

326
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.900
Silly, I know.

327
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.600
- Not silly.

328
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.900
You must be
still just awash with grief

329
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.800
and there's
no deadline for that.

330
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:10.300
- I just feel really lost
without him, you know?

331
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.300
Do you believe in
life after death--

332
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.300
- Ah! Uh! Beast!

333
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.000
Oh, this house will
be the death of me.

334
00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.500
More wine, right now.

335
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.900
Oh, wow.

336
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.600
Bye, love. See you tomorrow.

337
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.000
Nana?

338
00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.900
Is that you?

339
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:19.500
d <i>A love no one understands</i>

340
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.500
Nan?

341
00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:25.800
Let's get you back to bed, okay?

342
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.800
It's not safe
for you to be out...

343
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.900
<i>Anna?</i>

344
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.900
<i>Anna, are you there?</i>

345
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.200
He's here.

346
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.800
<i>I think I'm losing my mind.</i>

347
00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.400
- No, you're not.

348
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.200
You're just really,
really tired.

349
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.800
And stress can do really
curious things to us, too.

350
00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.800
<i>But what you've got to remember,</i>

351
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.900
<i>is that most of the time</i>

352
00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.000
<i>she's kind of in a world</i>
<i>of her own, you know,</i>

353
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.700
<i>and what seems like</i>
<i>weird behavior to us</i>

354
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.000
<i>is perfectly normal to her</i>
<i>and if we try to correct it</i>

355
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.300
<i>or question her,</i>
<i>it's like saying to her</i>

356
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.800
<i>that everything</i>
<i>she knows is a lie.</i>

357
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.800
- I just don't want
to be in this house.

358
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.200
- No.

359
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.100
- I've never liked it
and I don't even know why.

360
00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.900
I need to be here for Nan.

361
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.100
I want to keep her safe
and I love her so much,

362
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.800
and I don't--

363
00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.000
- Do you want me
to stay tonight?

364
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.300
Would that be a thing?
- Oh god, would you?

365
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.100
- Yes. Of course I would.

366
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.900
- Okay.
- It's okay, it's okay.

367
00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.000
- Karen?

368
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.800
- That hairstyle
was all the rage back then.

369
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
- It really suited you, Nan.

370
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.200
- Young and care free.

371
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.200
Old and cared for now.

372
00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.100
- Happens to the best of us.

373
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.300
- Oh. Little Anna.

374
00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.400
Just like her mother.

375
00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.300
- I remember that
rope swing in the garden.

376
00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.200
- <i>Your father climbed</i>
<i>to the very top of that tree</i>

377
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.400
<i>so you could have</i>
<i>a swing in the garden.</i>

378
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.200
Up and up he went,
until I could hardly see him.

379
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.900
I was terrified
he was going to fall.

380
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.100
You were the apple of his eye.

381
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.000
He would've done
anything for you.

382
00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.500
So innocent.

383
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.100
I should've...

384
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.900
- Should've what, Nan?

385
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.300
- I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

386
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.300
- You're not supposed to
talk about what, Nan?

387
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.900
- Oh.

388
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.200
No!

389
00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.100
- Nan?

390
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.900
Nan? Nan?

391
00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:45.300
Nan! Nan!!

392
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.900
Nan, stop! Nan!

393
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.600
Stop!
Nan, please stop!

394
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.100
Nan, stop please!
- No!

395
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.300
- Calm down.
Nan, please.

396
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.600
- No! No! No!!
- Nan, please! Stop!

397
00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.000
Look at me,
you're going to hurt yourself.

398
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.600
Stop, please!
- Leave! Leave!

399
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.200
- Nan.
- Leave! Leave!

400
00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.600
- It's okay. It's okay, Lucy.

401
00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.600
It's okay, Lucy.
- You have to leave!

402
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.900
- It's okay, Lucy.
It's okay, love.

403
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.600
Try to calm down.
- You have to leave!

404
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.400
No, no she has to go!
No, no, no, no...

405
00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.500
Hello.

406
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.300
- I didn't mean to startle you.

407
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.500
- No, it's okay.

408
00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.100
- It's Anna, isn't it?

409
00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.700
- Yeah, that's right.

410
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.700
- Well, I haven't seen you in...

411
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:53.600
I don't know,
it must be twenty years.

412
00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.400
- I'm sorry I haven't
been over to say hello.

413
00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.600
- It's not a sin to be busy.

414
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.600
How's your grandmother?

415
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:06.300
- Yeah, she's, erm, managing.

416
00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.100
That's why I'm back
to help look after her.

417
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.500
Although I don't know
how much I'm actually helping.

418
00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.500
- I'm sure she's
very happy to have you here.

419
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.200
Spending time with loved ones
is always a blessing,

420
00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.700
especially as we get older.

421
00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.200
At least your mother
is always nearby.

422
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.600
I imagine Lucy
finds comfort in that.

423
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.600
And your grandfather, too.

424
00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.600
I'm sure William
is looking over the house,

425
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.600
despite the circumstances.

426
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.200
- Circumstances?

427
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.800
- That he could
see no other way.

428
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.200
Such a tragedy.

429
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.600
- What do you mean?

430
00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.200
- Well, I thought...

431
00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:59.300
It's not my place.
- No, please.

432
00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.500
- Your grandfather...

433
00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.700
took his own life.

434
00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.500
- No. No, he didn't.

435
00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.600
- I'm so sorry, Anna.

436
00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.600
I presumed you knew.

437
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.700
- But that's not true.

438
00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.600
He... he died
from a heart attack

439
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.500
from the stress
of my mother's death.

440
00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.700
I think William
was so overcome with sadness

441
00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:36.500
that he felt
there was no other choice.

442
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:41.700
You mother's death
was too much for him.

443
00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:08.300
Karen?

444
00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.500
Karen?

445
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.700
Where are you?

446
00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:33.900
Come on. Come on.

447
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.800
Nan?

448
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.900
Oh my god.

449
00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:34.400
Nan?

450
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:43.900
Nan?

451
00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.000
Nana?

452
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.100
Nana?

453
00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.100
Lucy?

454
00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:16.000
Nana? Nan?

455
00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.800
Nan?

456
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.100
Nan?!

457
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.000
Nan?!

458
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.000
Nan!
Nan, is that you?

459
00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.500
Nan?

460
00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:29.400
Ah!

461
00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.800
- Oh...

462
00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.800
- Lucy, it's Karen.
Are you okay?

463
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.500
- Help! Help!

464
00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:51.800
Nan! Karen! Help!

465
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:56.500
Help! Nana! Karen!

466
00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.200
- Lucy?

467
00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:06.100
- Help!

468
00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:13.200
- Anna, are you in here?

469
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.600
Lucy?

470
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.600
Is that you, my love?

471
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.500
- Oh, Anna.

472
00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:36.200
If this is you being jokey,
it's not funny.

473
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.200
<i>Anna!</i>

474
00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.000
- Who's there?

475
01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:13.100
- Oh! Oh! Oh god, Lucy.

476
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.900
Oh, Lucy. Darling.

477
01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.800
Where have you been?

478
01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:21.000
- He's here.

479
01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.200
Oh god.

480
01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.300
What...

481
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.200
- Oh, Anna.
Oh my god.

482
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.300
Oh my god, Anna. Anna.

483
01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.000
Are you okay?
Come on.

484
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.200
Anna. Anna.

485
01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.700
Come on.

486
01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.300
Come on, baby.
Up we go.

487
01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:33.800
It's alright.

488
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.200
Why's the car on?
Why's the car on, darling?

489
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.900
Why's the car on?

490
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.500
Oh god, Anna.

491
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.400
What's happening, sweetheart?
- Where's Nana?

492
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.100
- She's upstairs.

493
01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.800
- Sweetheart.
Why was the car on, darling?

494
01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.100
Sweetheart.

495
01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.200
Stop.

496
01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.000
What's happening?!

497
01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.500
- There is something
happening in this house,

498
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.700
and I don't know what it is,
and I can't explain it,

499
01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.300
but Nana
knows something about it.

500
01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.400
- Sweetheart, darling,

501
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.900
now I know
you've been stressed.

502
01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.200
- Stressed?! Stressed?

503
01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:13.100
You think stress
locked me in the garage?

504
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.300
Come on on, Karen,
she knows something.

505
01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.700
I think she's been trying
to tell us this whole time,

506
01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.000
and we've just dismissed it
because of her illness.

507
01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:48.400
It's Dad. It's Dad.

508
01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.500
Anna! Anna! Anna!

509
01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.300
<i>The wallpaper's changed.</i>

510
01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.500
<i>We're at Karen's house.</i>

511
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.100
- I know where we are.

512
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:41.200
The wallpaper used to be yellow,
it was better then.

513
01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.300
Karen said we can
stay here for a little while.

514
01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.500
- Well, how long are we staying?

515
01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.000
I don't know, Nan.

516
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.000
- Can we see
the birds again soon?

517
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.800
- Karen probably has birds
that visit her garden.

518
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:04.300
- They fly wherever they want,
but they always come back.

519
01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.100
- Nan...

520
01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:16.000
I have to ask you something
and it might upset you, okay?

521
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.600
I know about Grandad,
about what he did.

522
01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.500
- What he did?

523
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.100
- Taking his own life, Nan.

524
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:41.500
Was it something to do with Mum,
because she died?

525
01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:47.100
- You remind me
of her so much.

526
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.000
I didn't know.

527
01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.000
- You didn't know what, Nan?

528
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.900
- William was sick.

529
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.500
He...

530
01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:17.500
he...

531
01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:21.600
hurt our little girl.

532
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.200
I didn't know.

533
01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.000
I didn't know
until it was too late.

534
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I never would've
let him hurt my Maggie.

535
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.300
When your mother died...

536
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.500
...your father learnt the truth.

537
01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.100
She was your daughter.

538
01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.200
Your daughter!

539
01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:58.500
You're sick!!

540
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.000
- Mum's death...

541
01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:10.200
My birth...

542
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.100
It exposed him.

543
01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.700
- My daughter
won't ever know you exist.

544
01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.600
You're never coming near Anna!

545
01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.300
- His secret was out.

546
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.200
<i>He got blind drunk.</i>

547
01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:17.800
- He got drunk and killed
himself after Maggie's funeral,

548
01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:21.100
because he was a coward.

549
01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:56.600
- William destroyed our family.

550
01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.500
- Nan.

551
01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:24.400
- <i>"Behold, I was</i>
<i>brought forth in iniquity,</i>

552
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.300
<i>and in sin</i>
<i>my mother conceived me."</i>

553
01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:33.400
We are all born
with the capacity to sin,

554
01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.400
but each one of us
is ultimately responsible

555
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.700
for our own sins

556
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.700
and for the choices we make.

557
01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:48.500
God said,
"Let us make man in our image,

558
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.800
after our likeness."

559
01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:54.500
"And let them have dominion
over the fish of the sea,

560
01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.200
"the birds of the heavens,

561
01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:01.700
and every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth."

562
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.300
Dominion, an interesting word...

563
01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:13.100
power and control,
the authority to rule over.

564
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Dominion implies ownership,
the power to impose our will,

565
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.300
to exploit
for self-serving desires.

566
01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:27.900
It is none of these things.

567
01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:32.000
Having dominion over something
is a grave responsibility,

568
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.500
the responsibility
not to impose our power,

569
01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:41.400
but to allow all living things
the choice to be good.

570
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.800
What makes us human
is not being good,

571
01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.800
but choosing to be good.

572
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:53.800
Choosing to reject evil
and repent our sins.

573
01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:59.600
Choosing wisdom over fear,
love over hate,

574
01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:07.300
because through wisdom and love
all things are possible.

575
01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:11.300
When we recognize
our sins and repent,

576
01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:17.300
only then are we free
to move forward,

577
01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.200
be at peace,

578
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.300
and live in
the light of God's love.

579
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:37.300
- d <i>Guide me</i>
<i>O thou great Redeemer</i>

580
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.800
d <i>Pilgrim through</i>
<i>This barren land</i> dd

581
01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:48.300
- Lovely to see you
in church, Anna.

582
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.000
May I?
- Please.

583
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:01.600
Do you believe in evil?

584
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.300
- Well, yes.
I somewhat have to.

585
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.700
Good goes hand in hand with bad.

586
01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:16.800
If I believe in God, I have to
believe in the other guy.

587
01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.900
I have no doubt
evil exists in this world.

588
01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.300
- I need your help.

589
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.600
- Anna, you're obviously
under a lot of pressure.

590
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:48.100
Looking after someone
like your grandmother,

591
01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.900
with her symptoms,

592
01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:53.900
it's a very stressful situation.

593
01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.600
If you're happy to,

594
01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.900
I'd like us to pray together.

595
01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.500
<i>What happens now?</i>

596
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.100
- I do not know.

597
01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.400
- I'm so sorry
I was a bit dismissive,

598
01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.600
I know I shouldn't have been,
and I'm so sorry.

599
01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.700
- I wouldn't have
believed me, either.

600
01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.900
- With your dad's death
and your gran's condition,

601
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.800
I just thought you were--
- Stressed.

602
01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.800
- Yeah.

603
01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:08.500
- Karen, you of all people do
not need to apologize to me.

604
01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.000
I don't know what
I would've done without you.

605
01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.900
- Your gran's right,
you're so like your mum.

606
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.600
She used to babysit me,
you know?

607
01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.800
- Mum did?
- Yeah.

608
01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.900
You know, thinking about it now.

609
01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.900
She always seemed
to be so relieved

610
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.900
to get away from the house.

611
01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.800
Can't even begin to imagine
what she was going through.

612
01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:36.800
William was such a stern man,
he was scary,

613
01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.700
he used to scare me actually,
but...

614
01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:45.900
You know you can stay here

615
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
for as long as you need to,
don't you?

616
01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:16.200
- It's okay. Shh. It's okay.
It's okay, Nan.

617
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.600
It's okay, Nan.

618
01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.100
Nan?

619
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.600
Nan?

620
01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:49.900
Nan?

621
01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:51.300
- I mean,
I was downstairs the whole time,

622
01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.700
I just don't know
how she got past me.

623
01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.100
- No, it's fine.
We just need to find her.

624
01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.600
Oh my god.

625
01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.700
- Just in case.
- Okay.

626
01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:28.700
Nan?
- Lucy?

627
01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:32.700
- Nana?
- Lucy?

628
01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:35.800
- Nana?
- It's only us, darling.

629
01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.100
Lucy?

630
01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:43.200
- It's my fault.

631
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.700
- Oh, Nan.

632
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.900
Here you go, Nan.

633
01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.700
We can't stay here.

634
01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.300
- We have to go, now.

635
01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.800
- Fine by me.

636
01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:32.700
It's alright, sweetheart.

637
01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.800
This way, darling.

638
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.700
- No!

639
01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.100
Leave them alone.

640
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.900
Just take me.

641
01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.200
- Lucy!

642
01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.700
- Just take me. Just take me.

643
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.900
- I've got you.

644
01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.400
- Okay, this way.
It's okay.

645
01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.800
It's alright, sweetheart.

646
01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.400
Anna, we've got to
get her in the chair.

647
01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:04.800
I'll get the door.

648
01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.800
- Here you go, Nan.
I've got you now.

649
01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.100
I've got it.

650
01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.300
Come on! Come on!!

651
01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.000
- Karen! Karen.

652
01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.000
Karen, can you hear me?
Karen?

653
01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.200
Karen...

654
01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:43.300
- You hurt our little girl.

655
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.900
- Leave us alone!

656
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.400
- William, you were
supposed to protect us,

657
01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.300
but you destroyed out family.

658
01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.800
I hate you.

659
01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.800
- No!

660
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.900
Stop.

661
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.500
- She was your daughter.

662
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.000
Your daughter!

663
01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.100
You're sick!

664
01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.300
- Please stop.

665
01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:22.100
I buried my daughter today.

666
01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.900
- Tell her.

667
01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:27.100
- Tell me what?

668
01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.400
No. Oh...

669
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.000
- William?

670
01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:14.600
It isn't true, is it?

671
01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:27.700
- William.

672
01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.400
Lucy.

673
01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.500
Lucy?

674
01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.700
- No!

675
01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.500
- Lucy!

676
01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.200
Lucy!

677
01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.800
- Lucy!

678
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.900
Lucy.

679
01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:49.500
What?

680
01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.600
Somehow, despite you,
my mother found happiness.

681
01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:04.000
I'm living proof
of my parents love, real love,

682
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.400
not the sick ordeal
you put her through,

683
01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.200
you deserve to die.

684
01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:12.300
No! You do not get to
play this song anymore.

685
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.300
- Dad?
- Mm-hmm.

686
01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.700
- What was Mum like?

687
01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:35.400
- Your mother was beautiful,

688
01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:37.300
and clever,

689
01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:39.600
kind,

690
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.500
and so brave,
just like you.

691
01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:05.700
Nan. Nan.

692
01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.600
Oh, Nan.

693
01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.700
No, Nan.

694
01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:21.800
Oh, no. No, no.

695
01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:46.600
<i>A love no one understands</i>

696
01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:51.100

697
01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:55.700
<i>Some say its wrong</i>
<i>But I don't care</i>

698
01:31:55.900 --> 01:32:00.100
<i>A love like ours</i>

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:05.800

705
01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:30.200
<i>I'm by your side</i>
<i>Yes, I'm always near</i>

<i>No, not a tear</i>

707
01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:39.800
<i>I'll be right here</i>
<i>So you've nothing to fear</i>

<i>I was lost</i>
<i>In a cloud of confusion</i>

709
