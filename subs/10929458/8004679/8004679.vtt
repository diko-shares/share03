00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.588
- [clicking]
- [beeping]

3
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:30.532
- [Anna] <i>Dad?</i>

4
00:00:30.565 --> 00:00:31.498
- [Harry] <i>Yes, Anna?</i>

5
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.034
- [Anna] <i>Can you tell me</i>
<i>a scary story?</i>

6
00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:36.370
[thunder cracks]

7
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:42.209
- Once upon a time,

8
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.181
there was a little girl
called... Anna.

9
00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:53.588
And she lived in
a big house in the countryside.

10
00:00:53.888 --> 00:01:00.628
One dark and very creepy night,
she was asleep in bed.

11
00:01:01.563 --> 00:01:04.498
All of a sudden, she woke up.

12
00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.202
From downstairs,
she heard a noise,

13
00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:12.306
the floorboards creaking.

14
00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:18.145
Creak, creak, creak.

15
00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:20.815
And then a voice began talking.

16
00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:23.350
"Anna!

17
00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:26.153
"Anna!

18
00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:29.389
I'm coming to get you."

19
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.260
Then silence.

20
00:01:33.828 --> 00:01:35.362
- What happened?

21
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:40.300
- Beneath the blanket,
Anna heard breathing.

22
00:01:40.668 --> 00:01:43.605
[gasping sounds]

23
00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:49.844
She felt
the thing moving closer.

24
00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:53.280
Long fingers on the blanket.

25
00:01:55.717 --> 00:01:59.286
And when Anna thought
she couldn't take anymore,

26
00:01:59.854 --> 00:02:01.522
the voice said...

27
00:02:02.757 --> 00:02:05.392
"I'm right here,

28
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:08.663
"and I've...

29
00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:10.765
got you!"
- [Anna screams]

30
00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:13.333
[both laugh]

31
00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:16.604
That was a good one.

32
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.540
- Okay you, time to sleep.

33
00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:27.682
Nana's going to bed too,
so no wandering around, okay?

34
00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.717
[thunder cracks]
- Okay.

35
00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:32.486
[smooch]

36
00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:37.491
- Lights on or off?

37
00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:38.893
- On.

38
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:41.228
- Sleep tight.

39
00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:43.531
- Don't let the bed bugs bite.

40
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:45.165
- [chuckles]

41
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.442

- [ghostly hiss]

46
00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:20.200
- Dad?

47
00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:24.237
Dad?

48
00:03:24.672 --> 00:03:27.207

[door opens]
- Anna!

77
00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:47.094
I thought I heard the door.
It's so lovely to see you.

78
00:08:47.128 --> 00:08:48.863
- Yeah and you.

79
00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:50.564

nan's favorites.

Such a lovely, lovely guy.

00:09:01.742 --> 00:09:03.277

86
00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:06.147

Lucy.

94
00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:27.868
Lucy darling,
look who I've got here.

95
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.038
- Hey, Nan.

96
00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:33.874
- Maggie?

97
00:09:33.908 --> 00:09:36.644
- No, it's-it's Anna,
sweetheart.

98
00:09:36.677 --> 00:09:39.780
It's Anna,
your gorgeous granddaughter.

99
00:09:40.848 --> 00:09:41.982
- Anna?

100
00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:44.118
- That's right, darling.

101
00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:48.789
I'll go put the kettle on

102
00:09:48.823 --> 00:09:50.591
and give you
a chance to catch up.

103
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:56.330
- Hi, Nan.

104
00:09:57.098 --> 00:09:59.633
[clock ticking]

105
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.912

106
00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:15.282
- No.

107
00:10:15.584 --> 00:10:17.618
Maggie's not here.

108
00:10:18.686 --> 00:10:20.287
It's just me.

109
00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:22.823
- That's a shame.

110
00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:27.628
- I'm here to look after you.

111
00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:31.165
- Hmm.

112
00:10:50.985 --> 00:10:53.654
- Bet you need that
after your long drive.

113
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.360
You must try not to
take it personally, Anna.

114
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.928
- Hmm.

115
00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:06.834
She doesn't even remember me.

116
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:08.969
- [sighs]

117
00:11:09.003 --> 00:11:11.805
It's just that,
sometimes she's lost in the fog

118
00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:13.374
and sometimes
she's finds her way out,

119
00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:16.043
but she's still the same
person you grew up loving.

120
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.945
She's so happy you're here.

121
00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:19.246
- Hmm.

122
00:11:21.282 --> 00:11:22.750

[deep sigh]

124
00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:28.989
Strange being back.

125
00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:33.294
I have so many memories
tied to this house.

[birds cooing]

139
00:14:20.427 --> 00:14:21.596
Hmm.

140
00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:23.897
- [Harry] <i>Anna.</i>

141
00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:27.201
[echoes] Ready or not
here I come.

142
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.206
[echoes] You can't hide forever.

143
00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:36.143
I'm coming to get you.

144
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.613
I wonder where Anna is?

145
00:14:38.747 --> 00:14:40.381
Lets get another one.
- Okay.

146
00:14:40.414 --> 00:14:42.584
- Where could she be?

147
00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:46.453
I wonder if she's here!

- You want to play another one?

151
00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:54.962
- Yes.

152
00:14:54.995 --> 00:14:57.131
- Ten. Nine.

153

[ghostly laughing]

158
00:15:35.202 --> 00:15:36.136
- It's really good you're here.

159
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.739
You know, it's important
being around family,

160
00:15:37.772 --> 00:15:40.174
it's going to
do your gran a lot of good.

161
00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:42.443
- Yeah, well, I hope so.

162
00:15:42.476 --> 00:15:46.980
- Um, and I'll be back
about ten in the morning

163
00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:48.415
- Yeah, great.

[wind chime jingles]

169
00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:10.638
- You look
just like your father.

170
00:16:11.004 --> 00:16:12.540
Same eyes.

171
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.742
You've got Harry's eyes.

172
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.010
- Have I?

173
00:16:17.712 --> 00:16:19.547
- Where is Harry?

174
00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:22.049
Will he be staying here, too?

175
00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:24.084
- No, Nan.

176
00:16:24.652 --> 00:16:26.521
He's not with us anymore.

177
00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:28.723
- Where did he go?

178
00:16:29.022 --> 00:16:30.658
- He's gone.

179
00:16:32.426 --> 00:16:34.161
Dad...

180
00:16:35.062 --> 00:16:37.097
Harry died, Nan.

181
00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:44.271
- Yes. No. Of course.

182
00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:47.575
I knew that, I knew that.

183
00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:51.278
Such a shame.

184
00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:53.615
Lovely man.

185
00:16:55.315 --> 00:16:56.483
Hm.

186
00:16:57.719 --> 00:17:02.657
He used to dance with me,
insisted on it.

187
00:17:03.223 --> 00:17:06.326

Nibbles had died.

at the top of the tank,

but instead of telling me,

428
00:35:56.256 --> 00:35:58.392
he went out
and bought another fish,

429
00:35:58.626 --> 00:36:00.595

in the back garden,

for over twenty years.

he was going to fall.

548
00:47:30.918 --> 00:47:33.187
You were the apple of his eye.

549
00:47:33.487 --> 00:47:36.090
He would've done
anything for you.

550
00:47:44.699 --> 00:47:46.500
So innocent.

551
00:47:48.302 --> 00:47:50.137
I should've...

552
00:47:51.438 --> 00:47:52.973
- Should've what, Nan?

553
00:47:54.609 --> 00:47:57.344
- I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

554
00:47:57.812 --> 00:48:00.381
- You're not supposed to
talk about what, Nan?

555
00:48:04.318 --> 00:48:05.919
- Oh.

556
00:48:17.599 --> 00:48:20.100
[whimpering]

557
00:48:21.368 --> 00:48:23.203
No!

558
00:48:24.238 --> 00:48:25.105
- Nan?

559
00:48:25.205 --> 00:48:27.975
- [screaming]
- Nan? Nan?

560
00:48:28.108 --> 00:48:30.310
Nan! Nan!!

561
00:48:30.411 --> 00:48:32.913
Nan, stop! Nan!

562
00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.650
Stop!
Nan, please stop!

563
00:48:36.016 --> 00:48:38.185
Nan, stop please!
- No!

564
00:48:38.218 --> 00:48:40.320
- Calm down.
Nan, please.

565
00:48:40.354 --> 00:48:42.657
- No! No! No!!
- Nan, please! Stop!

566
00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:45.092
Look at me,
you're going to hurt yourself.

567
00:48:45.125 --> 00:48:48.630
Stop, please!
- Leave! Leave!

568
00:48:48.663 --> 00:48:50.297
- Nan.
- Leave! Leave!

569
00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:51.666
- It's okay. It's okay, Lucy.

570
00:48:51.699 --> 00:48:53.601
It's okay, Lucy.
- You have to leave!

571
00:48:53.635 --> 00:48:55.969
- It's okay, Lucy.
It's okay, love.

572
00:48:56.003 --> 00:48:57.672
Try to calm down.
- You have to leave!

573
00:48:57.772 --> 00:49:01.475
No, no she has to go!
No, no, no, no...

574
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:04.011
[dramatic piano music]

575
00:49:11.351 --> 00:49:14.121
- [breathing heavily]

576
00:49:21.295 --> 00:49:24.465
[dramatic music]

577
00:49:50.057 --> 00:49:52.092
[bird squawking]

578
00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.763
[wind howling]

00:49:58.165 --> 00:50:00.668
[eerie music building]

580
00:50:09.677 --> 00:50:11.579
[bird squawking]

581
00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.523
- Hello.
- [gasps]

582
00:50:21.556 --> 00:50:23.423
[exhales]

583
00:50:23.457 --> 00:50:25.392
- I didn't mean to startle you.

584
00:50:26.828 --> 00:50:28.530
- No, it's okay.

585
00:50:28.796 --> 00:50:30.163
- It's Anna, isn't it?

586
00:50:30.197 --> 00:50:31.766
- Yeah, that's right.

587
00:50:32.366 --> 00:50:34.736
- Well, I haven't seen you in...

588
00:50:35.135 --> 00:50:38.673
I don't know,
it must be twenty years.

589
00:50:38.773 --> 00:50:41.475
- I'm sorry I haven't
been over to say hello.

590
00:50:41.576 --> 00:50:43.645
- It's not a sin to be busy.

591
00:50:44.478 --> 00:50:45.647
How's your grandmother?

592
00:50:47.649 --> 00:50:51.318
- Yeah, she's, erm, managing.

593
00:50:51.418 --> 00:50:54.121
That's why I'm back
to help look after her.

594
00:50:54.556 --> 00:50:56.524
Although I don't know
how much I'm actually helping.

595
00:50:56.858 --> 00:50:59.561
- I'm sure she's
very happy to have you here.

596
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:03.297
Spending time with loved ones
is always a blessing,

597
00:51:03.698 --> 00:51:05.733
especially as we get older.

598
00:51:06.601 --> 00:51:09.236
At least your mother
is always nearby.

599
00:51:10.004 --> 00:51:12.674
I imagine Lucy
finds comfort in that.

600
00:51:13.073 --> 00:51:16.644
And your grandfather, too.

601
00:51:18.178 --> 00:51:20.682
I'm sure William
is looking over the house,

602
00:51:20.982 --> 00:51:23.618
despite the circumstances.

603
00:51:24.819 --> 00:51:26.286
- Circumstances?

604
00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:28.823
- That he could
see no other way.

605
00:51:29.657 --> 00:51:31.224
Such a tragedy.

606
00:51:32.827 --> 00:51:34.696
- What do you mean?

607
00:51:35.128 --> 00:51:37.297
- Well, I thought...

608
00:51:40.467 --> 00:51:44.338
It's not my place.
- No, please.

609
00:51:47.307 --> 00:51:49.510
- Your grandfather...

610
00:51:50.778 --> 00:51:52.747
took his own life.

611
00:51:56.249 --> 00:51:58.586
- No. No, he didn't.

612
00:52:00.722 --> 00:52:03.625
- I'm so sorry, Anna.

613
00:52:04.391 --> 00:52:06.661
I presumed you knew.

614
00:52:07.461 --> 00:52:08.763
- But that's not true.

615
00:52:08.796 --> 00:52:12.634
He... he died
from a heart attack

616
00:52:12.667 --> 00:52:15.502
from the stress
of my mother's death.

617
00:52:16.136 --> 00:52:18.706
I think William
was so overcome with sadness

618
00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.542
that he felt
there was no other choice.

619
00:52:23.343 --> 00:52:26.714
You mother's death
was too much for him.

620
00:52:31.519 --> 00:52:34.221
[mournful music]

621

636
00:55:03.838 --> 00:55:05.740
Where are you?

637
00:55:14.849 --> 00:55:16.083
[smacking light]

638
00:55:16.117 --> 00:55:18.986
Come on. Come on.
