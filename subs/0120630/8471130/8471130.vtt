will it take?

167
00:16:55.577 --> 00:17:00.365
{\an4}Perhaps it wouldn't be empty if she'd
spent more time layin' and less time escapin'.

168
00:17:00.406 --> 00:17:02.404
So laying eggs all your life...

169
00:17:02.446 --> 00:17:06.026
{\an4}and then getting plucked,
stuffed and roasted is good enough for you, is it?

170
00:17:06.068 --> 00:17:07.690
{\an8}It's a livin'.

171
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:10.480
{\an7}You know what the problem is?

172
00:17:10.522 --> 00:17:14.851
{\an4}The fences aren't just round the farm.
They're up here in your heads.

173
00:17:14.893 --> 00:17:19.097
{\an4}There's a better place out
there somewhere beyond that hill,

174
00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:23.801
and it has wide open spaces
and lots of trees...

175
00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:26.131
{\an8}and grass.

176
00:17:26.173 --> 00:17:31.045
Can you imagine that?
Cool, green grass.

177
00:17:31.086 --> 00:17:34.540
- Who feeds us?
- We feed ourselves.

178
00:17:34.582 --> 00:17:36.914
- <i>Well, where's the farm?</i>
- There is no farm.

179
00:17:36.955 --> 00:17:40.576
{\an5}- Then where does the farmer live?
- There is no farmer, Babs.

180
00:17:40.618 --> 00:17:44.364
{\an5}- Is he on holiday?
- He isn't anywhere. Don't you get it?

181
00:17:44.406 --> 00:17:47.945
{\an4}There's no morning head count,
no farmers, no dogs and coops and keys...

182
00:17:47.987 --> 00:17:50.150
{\an8}<i>and no fences.</i>

183

{\an5}The chances of us gettin' out
of here are a million to one.

187

{\an4}Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

{\an4}No. What's on the poster, Babs.
What's on the poster. We'll fly out!

207
00:19:57.364 --> 00:20:01.402
{\an4}He must be very important to have
his picture taken. What do you suppose he does?

208
00:20:01.444 --> 00:20:04.358
{\an5}Isn't it obvious?
He's a professional flying rooster.

209

He flies from farm to farm,
giving demonstrations.

- Oh, absolutely.

{\an7}You took a rather nasty fall.

218

{\an4}And sprained the anterior tendon
connecting your radius to your humerus.

219
00:20:29.792 --> 00:20:32.123
{\an4}I gave it a wee bit of a

- She said you sprained your wing. She fixed it.

- I-I carried you in.

{\an5}[Chuckles] Let's back up and
start from the top. Where am I?

{\an5}You're right. How rude of us.
We're just very excit...

{\an8}And we're the chickens.

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:56.516
Yeah, with you so far.
Chicken farm, chickens...

- Father, please.
- And he's a Yank!

{\an5}Easy, Pops.
Cockfighting's illegal where I come from.

{\an8}And where is that exactly?

232
00:21:07.381 --> 00:21:10.295
{\an5}Just a little place I call the land
of the free and the home of the brave.

- Scotland!
- No! America.

Oh! America.

{\an8}Uh, who wants to know?

243
00:21:44.555 --> 00:21:46.594

desperate chickens.

244
00:21:46.636 --> 00:21:50.674
{\an5}You see, if it is you, then you just
might be the answer to our prayers.

{\an5}Well, then, call me a miracle,

247
00:22:00.456 --> 00:22:03.370
And what brings you
to England, Mr. Rhodes?

248
00:22:03.411 --> 00:22:06.908
Why, all the beautiful

249

You see, I'm
a traveler by nature.

251
00:22:12.319 --> 00:22:15.942

for a while, but I couldn't really get into it.

- Ooh!
- <i>Isn't that great?</i>

258
00:22:36.631 --> 00:22:38.960
{\an1}- Oh, it's possible, all right.
- I knew it was possible.

259
00:22:39.002 --> 00:22:41.167
{\an5}I knew the answer
would come. Amen!

260
00:22:41.209 --> 00:22:45.289
{\an4}We're all going to fly over that fence,
and Mr. Rhodes is going to show us how, right?

261
00:22:45.331 --> 00:22:49.950
That's... What?
Did you say "fly"?

262
00:22:49.992 --> 00:22:52.574
- You can teach us.
- No, I can't.

263
00:22:52.616 --> 00:22:56.860
{\an1}- Listen. Shh. You hear that?
- [Silence]

264
00:22:56.902 --> 00:23:00.525
{\an4}That's the open road calling my name,
and I was born to answer that call. Bye.

266
00:23:05.437 --> 00:23:08.558
{\an5}Okay, okay, where's the exit?
Ah, this way.

267
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.512
{\an5}Mr. Rhodes, um, perhaps I didn't
explain our situation properly.

268
00:23:12.554 --> 00:23:15.261
We lay eggs day in and day out,

269
00:23:15.303 --> 00:23:18.466
and when we can't lay
any more, they kill us.

270
00:23:18.507 --> 00:23:22.545
{\an4}It's a cruel world, doll face.
You might as well get used to it.

271
00:23:22.587 --> 00:23:25.168
Which part of "they kill us"
do you not understand?

272
00:23:25.209 --> 00:23:27.707
I got my own set
of problems to worry about.

273
00:23:27.748 --> 00:23:30.080
Besides, this birdcage can't
be that hard to bust out of.

{\an8}In fact, watch me.

275
00:23:33.535 --> 00:23:36.490
{\an4}It's not so hard to get one
chicken out of here or even two,

276
00:23:36.532 --> 00:23:38.363
{\an8}but this is about all of us.

277
00:23:40.777 --> 00:23:43.233
{\an5}- All of you?
- That's what I've been trying to tell you.

Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

in this place out of here at the same time?

- Of course.
- You're certifiable.

You can't pull off a stunt
like that. That's suicide.

there's a way.

- Hard work.
- You said hard work twice!

Hatches into the first chicken.</i>

1140
01:22:55.069 --> 01:22:58.024
{\an8}[Fetcher] <i>Yeah, but where'd
the egg come from, then?</i>

01:22:58.065 --> 01:22:59.896
{\an8}[Nick] <i>What do you mean,
where'd it come from?</i>

no egg to come rollin' along.</i>

1145
01:23:09.011 --> 01:23:11.966
{\an7}[Nick] <i>Well, conversely, without
an egg to hatch into the chicken,</i>

1146
01:23:12.008 --> 01:23:14.379
{\an7}<i>there will be no chicken to lay
the other egg that hatches into the chicken...</i>

1147
01:23:14.421 --> 01:23:16.376
{\an7}<i>that lays the egg
I mentioned in the first place.</i>

1149
01:23:17.916 --> 01:23:20.538

talking about the very first egg.

1150
01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:23.285
{\an7}[Fetcher] <i>But what happened about
the very first chicken? He's in the very first egg!</i>
