- Hard work.
- You said hard work twice!

342
00:27:38.429 --> 00:27:41.259

twice as much work as perseverance.

{\an8}[Nick]
<i>The egg, obviously.</i>

1138
01:22:50.325 --> 01:22:52.613
{\an8}<i>Rollin' along, happy as Larry.</i>

1139
01:22:52.655 --> 01:22:55.028
{\an7}<i>Then, crack!
Hatches into the first chicken.</i>

1140
01:22:55.069 --> 01:22:58.024
{\an8}[Fetcher] <i>Yeah, but where'd
the egg come from, then?</i>

1141
01:22:58.065 --> 01:22:59.896
{\an8}[Nick] <i>What do you mean,
where'd it come from?</i>

1142
01:22:59.938 --> 01:23:02.185
{\an8}[Fetcher] <i>Egg comes
rollin' along, happy as Larry.</i>

1143
01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:05.182
{\an8}<i>It's wonderin',
where'd it come from?</i>

1144
01:23:05.224 --> 01:23:08.969
{\an8}<i>Without a chicken, you get
no egg to come rollin' along.</i>

1145
01:23:09.011 --> 01:23:11.966
{\an7}[Nick] <i>Well, conversely, without
an egg to hatch into the chicken,</i>

1146
01:23:12.008 --> 01:23:14.379
{\an7}<i>there will be no chicken to lay
the other egg that hatches into the chicken...</i>

1147
01:23:14.421 --> 01:23:16.376
{\an7}<i>that lays the egg
I mentioned in the first place.</i>

1148
01:23:16.418 --> 01:23:17.874
{\an8}<i>So we got two eggs now?</i>

1149
01:23:17.916 --> 01:23:20.538
{\an8}[Nick] No, we're still
talking about the very first egg.

1150
01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:23.285
{\an7}[Fetcher] <i>But what happened about
the very first chicken? He's in the very first egg!</i>

1151
01:23:23.326 --> 01:23:27.321
{\an8}- <i>Aren't you listenin'?</i>
- [Rocky] <i>Uh, guys. Guys?</i>

1152
01:23:27.363 --> 01:23:29.568
{\an8}<i>Tryin' to enjoy paradise
over here.</i>

1153
01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:32.108
- Oh, sorry, guv.
- Beg your pardon.

1154
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:35.146
[Rocky] Thanks. Won't happen again.
[Chuckles]

1155
01:23:35.187 --> 01:23:37.601
- [Mutters] Gitface.
- [Mutters] Pillock.

1156
01:23:37.643 --> 01:23:41.263
{\an8}[Nick] <i>Thinks he's such a big shot
'cause he's got his name on a poster.</i>

1157
01:23:41.304 --> 01:23:43.677
{\an8}<i>These show biz folk
are all the same.</i>

1158
01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:46.590
{\an8}[Fetcher] <i>Yeah, the rats are the stars,
actually. Yeah, of course they are.</i>

1159
01:23:46.632 --> 01:23:49.461
{\an4}<i>But he does get all the birds.
We do all the work, he gets all the credit.</i>

1160
01:23:49.503 --> 01:23:51.251
{\an8}<i>He gets everything.
Yes, he does. Everything.</i>

1161
01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:53.041
{\an8}- <i>You said it, mate.</i>
- <i>I know.</i>
