1
00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:18.956
Shush!

2
00:02:26.595 --> 00:02:28.554
I'm stuck!

3
00:02:37.152 --> 00:02:39.672
Get back.

4
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:46.310
Hmm!

5
00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:24.583
- Mr. Tweedy.
- Eh?

6
00:03:24.623 --> 00:03:28.223
What is that chicken
doing outside the fence?

7
00:03:28.262 --> 00:03:30.543
Oh!
I don't know, love. I-

8
00:03:30.582 --> 00:03:34.021
Just deal with it.
Now!

9
00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:46.020
I'll teach you to make
a fool out of me.

10
00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.778
Now let that be a lesson
to the lot of ya!

11
00:03:51.858 --> 00:03:57.258
No chicken escapes
from Tweedy's farm!

12
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.239
Oh!

13
00:07:06.142 --> 00:07:09.541
Morning, Ginger.
Back from holiday?

14
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.461
I wasn't on holiday,
Babs.

15
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.580
I was in
solitary confinement.

16
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.500
Oh, it's nice to get a bit
of time to yourself, isn't it?

17
00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:23.618
Roll call!

18
00:07:23.698 --> 00:07:25.578
Come along now.
You'll be late for parade.

19
00:07:25.618 --> 00:07:28.778
Pip, pip. Quick march.
Left, right, left, right.

20
00:07:28.857 --> 00:07:32.177
- Left, right, left, right! Come on. Smarten up.
- Ooh!

21
00:07:32.257 --> 00:07:34.136
Discipline! Order!

22
00:07:34.217 --> 00:07:37.855
Back in my R.A.F. days when the
senior officer called for a scramble,

23
00:07:37.936 --> 00:07:40.335
you'd hop in the old crate
and tallyho.

24
00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:44.614
- Chocks away!
- Give over, you old fool. They just want to count us.

25
00:07:44.694 --> 00:07:47.453
Oh, how dare you talk back
to a senior ranking officer.

26
00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:51.254
- Why, back in my R.A.F. days-
- Fowler, they're coming. Back in line.

27
00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:53.293
- Oh, right, right.
- Oh!

28
00:07:54.692 --> 00:07:58.332
There will be a stern reprimand
for you, lad. You're grounded.

29
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:01.731
Attention!

30
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.489
Welcome back, hen.
Is there a new plan?

31
00:08:25.407 --> 00:08:28.726
I thought we tried
goin' under.

32
00:08:28.807 --> 00:08:31.286
Ah! Over. Right.

33
00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:43.924
How's the egg count?

34
00:08:43.963 --> 00:08:45.923
I've laid five eggs
this morning. Five!

35
00:08:46.003 --> 00:08:48.202
- Well-chuffed with that, I was-
- Shush!

36
00:08:56.401 --> 00:09:00.201
Oh, no. Edwina.

37
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.119
Bunty, why didn't you
give her some of yours?

38
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.078
I would have. She didn't tell me.
She didn't tell anyone.

39
00:09:17.037 --> 00:09:20.316
Oh, is Edwina
off on holiday?

40
00:10:15.346 --> 00:10:19.065
We've got to get out of here.

41
00:10:19.145 --> 00:10:21.864
Ginger!
Are we still on?

42
00:10:21.945 --> 00:10:24.425
Oh, we're on, all right.

43
00:10:24.504 --> 00:10:28.264
Spread the word, Mac.
Meeting tonight in hut 17.

44
00:10:48.259 --> 00:10:50.139
Oh!

45
00:10:54.538 --> 00:10:56.498
You called? Nick and-

46
00:10:56.578 --> 00:10:59.337
- Fetcher.
- At your service.

47
00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:05.256
Over here.

48
00:11:08.136 --> 00:11:10.015
We need some
more things.

49
00:11:10.055 --> 00:11:12.415
Right you are, miss.

50
00:11:12.495 --> 00:11:14.654
- How about this quality handcrafted tea set?
- Uh, no.

51
00:11:14.734 --> 00:11:16.574
- Or this lovely necklace and pendant?
- It's love-

52
00:11:16.654 --> 00:11:20.813
Or this beautiful little number, all the rage
in the fashionable chicken coops of Paris.

53
00:11:20.893 --> 00:11:22.893
Simply pop it on like so,

54
00:11:22.973 --> 00:11:25.093
and as the French hens say,
''Voila!''

55
00:11:25.173 --> 00:11:26.332
That's French.

56
00:11:26.413 --> 00:11:30.851
That's two hats in one, miss.
For parties, for weddings.

57
00:11:30.932 --> 00:11:34.850
Oh, but madame, this makes you
look like a vision, like a dream.

58
00:11:34.891 --> 00:11:37.771
- Like a duck.
- No, thank you.

59
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.050
We're making this. We need these things.
Can you get them?

60
00:11:41.129 --> 00:11:44.729
Oh, oh, oh,
this is a big job, miss.

61
00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:48.008
Oh, bigger than the others.
No, no. This is gonna cost.

62
00:11:48.089 --> 00:11:50.887
Same as always.
One bag of seed.

63
00:11:50.968 --> 00:11:53.528
- You call this pay?
- It's chicken feed.

64
00:11:53.606 --> 00:11:55.406
- What else could we give you?
- Eggs.

65
00:11:55.487 --> 00:11:57.326
- Eggs?
- Eggs.

66
00:11:57.407 --> 00:12:01.206
- We can't give you our eggs. They're too valuable.
- And so are we.

67
00:12:02.846 --> 00:12:04.685
After you, Fetcher.

68
00:12:05.965 --> 00:12:07.804
After I what?

69
00:12:07.884 --> 00:12:09.964
- Move!
- Ooh!

70
00:12:16.643 --> 00:12:19.242
Hmm.

71
00:12:19.323 --> 00:12:21.442
Twenty-two and nine.

72
00:12:21.523 --> 00:12:24.242
Fourteen shillings
and three pence.

73
00:12:24.321 --> 00:12:27.481
Seven and six pence times three.

74
00:12:27.561 --> 00:12:29.401
Two and nine.

75
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.599
Four pence halfpenny.

76
00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:36.159
D- oh! Stupid,
worthless creatures!

77
00:12:36.239 --> 00:12:41.719
I'm sick and tired of
making minuscule profits.

78
00:12:50.477 --> 00:12:52.916
Hmm.

79
00:12:58.195 --> 00:12:59.355
Hmm!

80
00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:02.874
Oh, yes.

81
00:13:02.914 --> 00:13:05.114
Those chickens
are up to something.

82
00:13:05.194 --> 00:13:07.874
Quiet.
I'm onto something.

83
00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:10.112
They're organized. I know it.

84
00:13:10.192 --> 00:13:12.472
- I said, quiet.
- That ginger one.

85
00:13:12.512 --> 00:13:14.392
I reckon she's their leader.

86
00:13:14.473 --> 00:13:16.552
Mr. Tweedy!

87
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:20.191
I may finally have found a way
to make us some real money around here,

88
00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:22.111
and what are you on about?

89
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.031
Ridiculous notions
Of escaping chickens.

90
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:28.908
- But- But- - It's all in
your head, Mr. Tweedy. Say it!

91
00:13:28.989 --> 00:13:31.309
It's all in me head.
It's all in me head.

92
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:34.509
Now, you keep telling
yourself that,

93
00:13:34.588 --> 00:13:37.228
because I don't want to hear
another word about it.

94
00:13:37.307 --> 00:13:40.467
- Is that clear?
- Yes, love.

95
00:13:40.548 --> 00:13:42.387
But you know that ginger one-

96
00:13:42.467 --> 00:13:45.186
They're chickens,
you dolt!

97
00:13:45.266 --> 00:13:48.785
Apart from you, they're the most
stupid creatures on this planet.

98
00:13:48.826 --> 00:13:53.944
They don't plot, they don't scheme,
and they are not organized!

99
00:13:54.024 --> 00:13:57.784
Order! Order!

100
00:13:57.864 --> 00:14:01.863
Quiet, everyone. Settle down.

101
00:14:01.943 --> 00:14:06.582
I would like to call to order-
Please, if you could just settle-

102
00:14:06.662 --> 00:14:09.022
Let's have some discipline
in the ranks! What, what!

103
00:14:09.102 --> 00:14:11.301
- Thank you, Fowler.
- In my R.A.F. days,

104
00:14:11.381 --> 00:14:14.141
we were never allowed to waste time
with unnecessary chitchat.

105
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.300
Yes, thank you, Fowler.

106
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.980
I-

107
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.300
Right!

108
00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:26.978
Carry on.

109
00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:32.778
Now, I know our last escape
attempt was a bit of a fiasco,

110
00:14:32.817 --> 00:14:35.737
but Mac and I have come up
with a brand-new plan.

111
00:14:35.818 --> 00:14:37.937
- Show 'em, Mac.

112
00:14:37.938 --> 00:14:40.056
- Right. We tried going under
the wire and that didn't work.

113
00:14:40.136 --> 00:14:44.255
So, the plan is,
we go over it.

114
00:14:44.335 --> 00:14:46.934
This is us, right?

115
00:14:47.014 --> 00:14:49.174
We get in like this.

116
00:14:49.214 --> 00:14:52.254
Wind her up
and... let her go!

117
00:14:57.213 --> 00:15:00.893
Good grief!
The turnip's bought it!

118
00:15:02.692 --> 00:15:06.171
Farmer's coming!

119
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.169
Operation Cover-up!

120
00:15:14.089 --> 00:15:15.048
Whee!

121
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.208
Ouch!

122
00:15:23.368 --> 00:15:25.328
Hmm.

123
00:15:29.567 --> 00:15:30.606
Huh?

124
00:15:37.445 --> 00:15:41.004
- Mr. Tweedy!
- Ooh. Ouch.

125
00:15:41.045 --> 00:15:44.883
- Where are you?
- Ooh. It's all in your head.

126
00:15:44.963 --> 00:15:47.043
It's all in your head.
It's all in your head.

127
00:15:50.243 --> 00:15:53.522
Think, everyone, think.
What haven't we tried yet?

128
00:15:53.602 --> 00:15:55.442
Uh-

129
00:15:55.522 --> 00:15:57.841
We haven't tried
not trying to escape.

130
00:15:57.921 --> 00:15:59.761
Hmm. That might work.

131
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:02.360
What about Edwina?

132
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.120
How many more empty nests
will it take?

133
00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:11.079
Perhaps it wouldn't be empty if she'd spent
more time layin' and less time escapin'.

134
00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:13.038
So laying eggs
all your life...

135
00:16:13.118 --> 00:16:15.438
and then getting plucked, stuffed
and roasted is good enough for you?

136
00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:17.677
It's a livin'.

137
00:16:17.717 --> 00:16:20.397
You know what the problem is?

138
00:16:20.477 --> 00:16:24.876
The fences aren't just round the farm.
They're up here in your heads.

139
00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:28.956
There's a better place out there
somewhere beyond that hill,

140
00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:33.714
and it has wide open spaces
and lots of trees...

141
00:16:33.794 --> 00:16:35.675
and grass.

142
00:16:35.754 --> 00:16:40.273
Can you imagine that?
Cool, green grass.

143
00:16:40.353 --> 00:16:43.633
- Who feeds us?
- We feed ourselves.

144
00:16:43.713 --> 00:16:45.792
- Well, where 's the farm?
- There is no farm.

145
00:16:45.872 --> 00:16:49.311
- Then where does the farmer live?
- There is no farmer, Babs.

146
00:16:49.392 --> 00:16:53.352
- Is he on holiday?
- He isn't anywhere. Don't you get it?

147
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.990
There's no morning head count, no
farmers, no dogs and coops and keys...

148
00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.989
and no fences.

149
00:17:00.029 --> 00:17:04.749
In all my life I've never
heard such a fantastic...

150
00:17:04.828 --> 00:17:06.468
load of tripe!

151
00:17:07.948 --> 00:17:10.028
Oh, face the facts, ducks.

152
00:17:10.068 --> 00:17:13.467
The chances of us gettin' out of here
are a million to one.

153
00:17:14.506 --> 00:17:16.906
Then there's still a chance.

154
00:17:37.862 --> 00:17:41.381
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.
What am I doing?

155
00:17:41.422 --> 00:17:45.741
Who are you trying to fool?
You can't lead this bunch of-

156
00:17:45.821 --> 00:17:49.820
Oh, heaven help us.

157
00:17:59.258 --> 00:18:02.257
Freedom!

158
00:18:02.338 --> 00:18:04.818
Huh?

159
00:18:18.215 --> 00:18:19.734
Whoa!

160
00:18:19.814 --> 00:18:23.054
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
You've been a wonderful audience.

161
00:18:24.373 --> 00:18:27.533
- Ouch!
- Oh, yes.

162
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.570
That's it.

163
00:18:42.651 --> 00:18:44.889
Get him inside quickly.

164
00:18:51.368 --> 00:18:53.687
This is our way out of here.

165
00:18:53.768 --> 00:18:55.487
We'll make posters?

166
00:18:55.567 --> 00:19:00.567
No. What's on the poster, Babs.
What's on the poster. We'll fly out!

167
00:19:00.646 --> 00:19:04.526
He must be very important to have his
picture taken. What do you suppose he does?

168
00:19:04.606 --> 00:19:07.566
Isn't it obvious?
He's a professional flying rooster.

169
00:19:07.645 --> 00:19:09.925
He flies from farm to farm,
giving demonstrations.

170
00:19:10.005 --> 00:19:12.564
- Do you suppose?
- Oh, absolutely.

171
00:19:12.604 --> 00:19:14.804
Not in the dark, no.
No, not in there. No.

172
00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:17.364
Get out. Good.
Gotta get-

173
00:19:22.082 --> 00:19:25.002
Who are you?
Where am I? What's goin' on?

174
00:19:25.082 --> 00:19:27.401
Ouch! What happened
to my wing?

175
00:19:27.482 --> 00:19:29.321
You took a rather nasty fall.

176
00:19:29.402 --> 00:19:31.721
And sprained the anterior tendon
connecting your radius to your humerus.

177
00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:33.641
I gave it a wee bit of a tweak,
Jimmy, and wrapped her up.

178
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.760
- Was that English?
- She said you sprained your wing. She fixed it.

179
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.479
- I made the bandage.
- I-I carried you in.

180
00:19:40.558 --> 00:19:43.279
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! Whoa.

181
00:19:43.359 --> 00:19:47.438
Let's back up
and start from the top. Where am I?

182
00:19:47.518 --> 00:19:50.357
You're right. How rude of us.
We're just very excit-

183
00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.277
This is a chicken farm.

184
00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:54.277
And we're the chickens.

185
00:19:54.357 --> 00:19:56.956
Yeah, with you so far.
Chicken farm, chickens-

186
00:19:57.036 --> 00:20:00.556
I don't like the look of this one.
His eyes are too close together.

187
00:20:00.636 --> 00:20:03.355
- Father, please.
- And he's a Yank!

188
00:20:03.395 --> 00:20:05.794
Easy, Pops. Cockfighting's
illegal where I come from.

189
00:20:05.874 --> 00:20:07.754
And where is that exactly?

190
00:20:07.794 --> 00:20:10.674
Just a little place I call the land
of the free and the home of the brave.

191
00:20:10.753 --> 00:20:13.713
- Scotland!
- No! America.

192
00:20:13.752 --> 00:20:16.193
Oh! America.

193
00:20:16.273 --> 00:20:21.392
Poppycock. Pushy Americans.
Always showing up late for every war.

194
00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:25.830
Overpaid, oversexed
And over here!

195
00:20:25.911 --> 00:20:27.630
What's eatin' Grandpa?

196
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.030
Oh, don't mind him,
Mister- Mister?

197
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.589
The name's Rocky. Rocky the
Rhode Island Red. Rhodes for short.

198
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:37.228
- Rocky Rhodes?
- Catchy, ain't it?

199
00:20:37.268 --> 00:20:40.067
Um, Mr. Rhodes,
is this you?

200
00:20:40.148 --> 00:20:43.787
Uh, who wants to know?

201
00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:45.948
A group of rather
desperate chickens.

202
00:20:45.987 --> 00:20:50.945
You see, if it is you, then you just
might be the answer to our prayers.

203
00:20:53.105 --> 00:20:57.544
Well, then, call me a miracle,
doll face, 'cause that's me.

204
00:20:58.944 --> 00:21:01.544
And what brings you
to England, Mr. Rhodes?

205
00:21:01.624 --> 00:21:04.823
Why, all the beautiful
English chicks, of course.

206
00:21:04.902 --> 00:21:07.863
Give over!

207
00:21:07.942 --> 00:21:10.182
You see, I'm
a traveler by nature.

208
00:21:10.262 --> 00:21:14.181
I did that whole barnyard thing for a
while, but I couldn't really get into it.

209
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:17.182
Hi. How are you? Nope.

210
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:19.220
The open road.
That's more my style.

211
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.381
Yep, just give me a pack on my back
and point me where the wind blows.

212
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.339
In fact, you know what
they call me back home?

213
00:21:26.419 --> 00:21:30.178
You're gonna love this.
The Lone Free Ranger.

214
00:21:30.258 --> 00:21:33.017
- Ooh!
- Isn't that great?

215
00:21:33.057 --> 00:21:35.497
- I knew it was possible.
- Oh, it's possible, all right.

216
00:21:35.578 --> 00:21:37.417
- I knew the answer would come.
- Amen!

217
00:21:37.498 --> 00:21:42.096
We're all going to fly over that fence, and
Mr. Rhodes is going to show us how, right?

218
00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:46.335
That's- What?
Did you say ''fly''?

219
00:21:46.376 --> 00:21:49.174
- You can teach us.
- No, I can't.

220
00:21:49.255 --> 00:21:52.494
Listen. Shh. You hear that?

221
00:21:52.534 --> 00:21:56.974
That's the open road calling my name,
and I was born to answer that call. Bye.

222
00:21:57.053 --> 00:22:00.253
He must have
very good hearing.

223
00:22:00.292 --> 00:22:04.252
Okay, okay, where's the exit?
Ah, this way.

224
00:22:04.332 --> 00:22:08.372
Mr. Rhodes, um, perhaps I didn't
explain our situation properly.

225
00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:10.691
We lay eggs
day in and day out,

226
00:22:10.771 --> 00:22:13.131
and when we can't lay
any more, they kill us.

227
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:17.289
It's a cruel world, doll face.
You might as well get used to it.

228
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.569
Which part of ''they kill us''
do you not understand?

229
00:22:20.649 --> 00:22:22.609
I got my own set
of problems to worry about.

230
00:22:22.649 --> 00:22:24.808
Besides, this birdcage can't
be that hard to bust out of.

231
00:22:24.888 --> 00:22:27.248
In fact, watch me.

232
00:22:27.288 --> 00:22:31.607
It's not so hard to get one
chicken out of here or even two,

233
00:22:31.687 --> 00:22:34.126
but this is about all of us.

234
00:22:34.206 --> 00:22:37.806
- All of you?
- That's what I've been trying to tell you.

235
00:22:37.886 --> 00:22:39.726
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

236
00:22:39.805 --> 00:22:43.284
You want to get every chicken in this
place out of here at the same time?

237
00:22:43.364 --> 00:22:46.604
- Of course.
- You're certifiable.

238
00:22:46.684 --> 00:22:49.044
You can't pull off a stunt
like that. That's suicide.

239
00:22:49.084 --> 00:22:50.523
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

240
00:22:50.604 --> 00:22:54.482
- Couldn't agree more. I will
be leaving that way. - But-

241
00:22:54.517 --> 00:22:55.961
- Mr. Rhodes?
- # I'm the type of guy #

242
00:22:56.042 --> 00:23:00.761
- Please! - # That likes to
roam around I'm never in one- #

243
00:23:17.998 --> 00:23:21.318
So that's it.
You're from the circus.

244
00:23:21.357 --> 00:23:23.238
Shh!

245
00:23:23.277 --> 00:23:25.158
You're on the run,
aren't you?

246
00:23:25.197 --> 00:23:27.156
You wanna keep it down?

247
00:23:27.236 --> 00:23:29.596
I'm trying to lay low here.

248
00:23:29.677 --> 00:23:32.635
I should turn you in
right now.

249
00:23:32.715 --> 00:23:36.354
- You wouldn't. Would you?
- Give me one reason why I shouldn't.

250
00:23:36.434 --> 00:23:38.474
Because I'm... cute?

251
00:23:42.394 --> 00:23:45.113
Hey, hey, hey!
What kind of crazy chick are you?

252
00:23:45.193 --> 00:23:48.273
- Do you know what'll happen if he finds me?
- It's a cruel world.

253
00:23:48.313 --> 00:23:50.192
I just decided.
I don't like you.

254
00:23:50.272 --> 00:23:52.832
I just decided. I don't care.
Now, show us how to fly.

255
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:55.471
- With this wing?
- Teach us then.

256
00:23:55.551 --> 00:23:56.870
No!

257
00:23:56.951 --> 00:24:00.430
He's valuable, you say?

258
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:02.590
- Sure.
- Get the torch.

259
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.909
Now you listen here, sister.
I'm not going back to that life.

260
00:24:05.948 --> 00:24:08.549
I'm a Lone Free Ranger.
Emphasis on free!

261
00:24:08.629 --> 00:24:11.308
And that's what we want.
Freedom!

262
00:24:13.988 --> 00:24:17.067
- Fancy that.
- They're coming this way.

263
00:24:17.146 --> 00:24:19.386
Oh, oh, no. No. Oh, no.
They're on to me.

264
00:24:19.467 --> 00:24:21.467
Teach us to fly
and we'll hide you.

265
00:24:21.545 --> 00:24:24.186
And if I don't?

266
00:24:24.226 --> 00:24:26.744
Was your father
by any chance a vulture?

267
00:24:26.825 --> 00:24:28.664
Do we have a deal?

268
00:24:47.501 --> 00:24:49.341
Time to make good
on that deal, doll-

269
00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:52.180
The name is Ginger.

270
00:25:08.377 --> 00:25:10.776
- Comfortable?
- Not really.

271
00:25:10.817 --> 00:25:15.576
- Maybe this will help.
- Nice hideout.

272
00:25:15.656 --> 00:25:17.855
Ouch. I had
more room in my egg.

273
00:25:17.935 --> 00:25:21.334
We've held up our end of the deal.
Tomorrow you hold up yours.

274
00:25:21.415 --> 00:25:23.294
- What deal?
- The flying!

275
00:25:23.375 --> 00:25:25.334
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right, right, right. Don't worry.

276
00:25:25.415 --> 00:25:27.293
I'll teach you
everything I know.

277
00:25:27.334 --> 00:25:30.252
Now, which bunk is mine?

278
00:25:32.973 --> 00:25:36.212
Absolutely outrageous!

279
00:25:36.292 --> 00:25:39.092
Asking a senior officer
to share his quarters...

280
00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:41.891
and with a non commissioned
Yank, no less.

281
00:25:41.971 --> 00:25:44.251
- Why, back in my day, I'd never-
- Hey!

282
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.610
You weren't exactly
my first choice either.

283
00:25:47.689 --> 00:25:49.970
And scoot over.
Your wing's on my side of the bunk.

284
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.329
Your side of the bunk?
The whole bunk is my side of the bunk!

285
00:25:54.408 --> 00:25:58.848
Just- What's that smell?
Is that your breath?

286
00:25:58.927 --> 00:26:01.687
It's absolutely
outrageous.

287
00:26:07.247 --> 00:26:10.526
So you wanna fly, huh?

288
00:26:10.606 --> 00:26:14.325
Well, it ain't gonna be easy, and it
ain't gonna happen overnight either.

289
00:26:14.404 --> 00:26:16.285
You see, flying
takes three things.

290
00:26:16.364 --> 00:26:20.284
Hard work,
perseverance and-

291
00:26:20.363 --> 00:26:23.284
- Hard work.
- You said hard work twice!

292
00:26:23.363 --> 00:26:28.002
That's because it takes
twice as much work as perseverance.

293
00:26:28.082 --> 00:26:31.481
Codswallop!

294
00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:37.961
Now, the most important thing is
we have to work as a team,

295
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.039
which means... you do
everything I tell you.

296
00:26:43.879 --> 00:26:47.559
Right! Let's rock and roll.

297
00:26:54.398 --> 00:26:57.397
- Oh. Oh, oh.
- Oh. Oh, oh.

298
00:27:24.431 --> 00:27:29.111
Mrs. Tweedy!
The chickens are-

299
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.750
Pecking?

300
00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:36.429
And left, two, three.
And right, two, three.

301
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:40.428
And... stop right there.
Oh, yeah, down.

302
00:27:40.469 --> 00:27:43.948
Down. Yeah, yeah, make little circles.
That's it. Faster.

303
00:27:44.028 --> 00:27:48.868
Faster.
Oh, yes. Perfect.

304
00:27:48.947 --> 00:27:52.786
Oh, that's the spot.

305
00:28:01.504 --> 00:28:04.384
I thought you were going
to teach us how to fly.

306
00:28:04.464 --> 00:28:06.863
That's what I'm doing.

307
00:28:06.944 --> 00:28:09.863
Isn't there usually
some flapping involved?

308
00:28:09.943 --> 00:28:13.143
Hey, do I tell you
how to lay eggs?

309
00:28:13.222 --> 00:28:15.582
Relax.
We're making progress.

310
00:28:15.623 --> 00:28:20.740
Really? I can't help feeling
we're going around in circles.

311
00:28:20.781 --> 00:28:24.661
What the- Hey! Cut it out!
You're making me dizzy.

312
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.305
I think they're
ready to fly now.

313
00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.300
Good, because they
certainly can't walk anymore.

314
00:28:32.259 --> 00:28:34.898
Up and at 'em, gals.
Let's flap.

315
00:28:39.618 --> 00:28:43.857
Watch, Fetcher. Let's see if old
Attila the Hen has come to her senses.

316
00:28:50.535 --> 00:28:54.255
It's raining hen!

317
00:28:57.414 --> 00:28:59.894
- What's this caper, love?
- We're flying.

318
00:28:59.973 --> 00:29:01.813
Obviously.

319
00:29:01.893 --> 00:29:06.853
- Flippin 'hell. Look at this, Fetch.
- They're gonna kill themselves.

320
00:29:06.932 --> 00:29:10.332
- Wanna watch?
- Yeah, all right.

321
00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:17.490
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

322
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.610
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

323
00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:24.089
Hey! Careful
of those eggs!

324
00:29:27.848 --> 00:29:30.608
Sunny-side up.

325
00:29:32.647 --> 00:29:34.927
Now they're over easy!

326
00:29:36.567 --> 00:29:38.407
Definitely scrambled.

327
00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:42.085
Go! Go! Go!

328
00:29:42.165 --> 00:29:44.885
Go, go, go, go! Go!

329
00:29:44.924 --> 00:29:47.405
Poultry in motion!

330
00:30:00.962 --> 00:30:03.122
Birds of a feather
flop together.

331
00:30:08.761 --> 00:30:10.681
Great work, ladies.
Great work!

332
00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.999
The pain you're feeling
is a good thing. It's good.

333
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.960
Pain is your friend, okay?
It's a positive thing.

334
00:30:15.999 --> 00:30:17.698
Just keep the faith there, uh

335
00:30:17.699 --> 00:30:19.398
- What was your name?
Agnes! You'll get there.

336
00:30:19.478 --> 00:30:21.358
Ducky, I think you
flew four feet today.

337
00:30:21.398 --> 00:30:25.437
Right, four feet!
From the roof to the ground.

338
00:30:25.517 --> 00:30:28.117
It's all part of the process, ladies.
Nothing to worry about.

339
00:30:28.157 --> 00:30:30.076
Ya cheese-eating little-

340
00:30:30.157 --> 00:30:31.996
Whoa!

341
00:30:33.037 --> 00:30:35.675
That doesn't sound good.
Ha, ha, ha.

342
00:30:35.756 --> 00:30:38.355
Okay, the ground's shaking.
Are we worried?

343
00:30:38.394 --> 00:30:40.675
Are we worried?

344
00:30:46.834 --> 00:30:49.913
The circus.
Quick. Hide me.

345
00:30:49.953 --> 00:30:51.952
- Hide me.
- Come on.

346
00:30:52.032 --> 00:30:56.871
One isn't awarded a medal like this for
flapping about like a lunatic, what.

347
00:30:56.951 --> 00:31:00.070
Now, see here!
This is an officer's quarters.

348
00:31:00.151 --> 00:31:02.471
- Quick. In here.
- Get out of here immediately, sir!

349
00:31:02.511 --> 00:31:04.670
Give it a rest, Pops.

350
00:31:04.749 --> 00:31:08.429
Out of here! I shall have you
on a charge within the week.

351
00:31:45.102 --> 00:31:47.101
Cheers, mate.

352
00:31:52.021 --> 00:31:55.901
It's all in your head.
It's all in your head.

353
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.939
It's all in your head.

354
00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.939
Ooh!

355
00:32:04.018 --> 00:32:07.378
What- What-
What's all this then?

356
00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:09.658
This is our future,
Mr. Tweedy.

357
00:32:09.738 --> 00:32:13.857
No more wasting time with petty
egg collection and minuscule profits.

358
00:32:13.897 --> 00:32:17.737
No more eggs?
But we've always been egg farmers.

359
00:32:17.815 --> 00:32:20.856
Me father and his father and all
their fathers. They was always-

360
00:32:20.935 --> 00:32:24.575
Poor! Worthless.
Nothings.

361
00:32:24.655 --> 00:32:26.494
But all that's about to change.

362
00:32:26.575 --> 00:32:29.854
This will take Tweedy's farm
out of the dark ages...

363
00:32:29.894 --> 00:32:33.493
and into full-scale
automated production.

364
00:32:33.573 --> 00:32:38.252
Melisha Tweedy will be poor no longer.

365
00:32:38.332 --> 00:32:40.932
Ooh!

366
00:32:41.012 --> 00:32:43.972
I'll put it together
then, shall I?

367
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.530
This isn't good, Mac.

368
00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.528
Whatever's in those boxes is for us,
and I don't think it's softer hay.

369
00:32:55.609 --> 00:32:58.009
Aye, hen. And I hate
to be the voice of doom,

370
00:32:58.089 --> 00:33:02.328
but I've been calculating my figures, and
I just don't think we're built for flyin'.

371
00:33:02.408 --> 00:33:05.887
But I saw him.
He flew in over that fence.

372
00:33:05.967 --> 00:33:07.806
Aye, aye, I believe you,

373
00:33:07.886 --> 00:33:12.126
but if we could just see it for
ourselves, that may answer some questions.

374
00:33:12.206 --> 00:33:14.325
You're right. I'm sorry.

375
00:33:14.405 --> 00:33:16.766
We've been at this all week,
and we're getting nowhere.

376
00:33:16.805 --> 00:33:21.964
If his wing were better, he could-
Oh! I'll have a word with him.

377
00:33:27.683 --> 00:33:29.323
Where is he?

378
00:33:29.403 --> 00:33:33.162
They didn't give me this medal
for being a Yank nanny.

379
00:33:33.202 --> 00:33:35.482
A simple ''I don't know''
would suffice.

380
00:33:35.522 --> 00:33:39.200
Beware of that one,
young Ginger.

381
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.640
That Yank is not
to be trusted.

382
00:33:41.721 --> 00:33:45.840
That Yank is our ticket
out of here.

383
00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:49.719
And the pig says to the horse,
''Hey, fella, why the long face?''

384
00:33:51.558 --> 00:33:54.438
Oh, oh, look, look.

385
00:33:54.518 --> 00:33:57.678
Oh. Cocktail!

386
00:33:57.718 --> 00:33:59.238
Give over!

387
00:34:03.276 --> 00:34:07.995
So, um, anyway-

388
00:34:08.075 --> 00:34:11.874
Remember those flying tips tomorrow.
They're very important.

389
00:34:11.954 --> 00:34:14.714
Keep thinking
those flighty thoughts.

390
00:34:14.794 --> 00:34:16.993
Oh, yeah.

391
00:34:17.033 --> 00:34:18.913
They're swell chicks.
They really are.

392
00:34:18.953 --> 00:34:23.673
Look at what Babs made me.
A beakwarmer. Isn't that the cutest?

393
00:34:23.752 --> 00:34:27.431
And that bunty.
She really packs a punch.

394
00:34:27.466 --> 00:34:29.791
Is there a problem here?

395
00:34:29.872 --> 00:34:31.871
- Have we flown over that fence?
- Not quite.

396
00:34:31.951 --> 00:34:35.110
- Then there's a problem.
- Good things come to those who wait, doll face.

397
00:34:35.191 --> 00:34:37.070
Ginger!

398
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:47.828
- Okay, how long did it take you?
- To do what?

399
00:34:47.908 --> 00:34:49.787
To learn how to fly.

400
00:34:49.827 --> 00:34:52.627
Apples and oranges, baby doll.
I'm gifted. They're not.

401
00:34:52.707 --> 00:34:55.187
You can't compare
the two, okay?

402
00:34:55.267 --> 00:34:57.305
The point is,
these things take time.

403
00:34:57.386 --> 00:34:59.265
Which we are rapidly
running out of.

404
00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:01.305
- We haven't even lifted off the ground. Why?
- Thrust.

405
00:35:01.386 --> 00:35:05.785
I went over my calculations, and I figured
the key element we're missing is thrust.

406
00:35:08.944 --> 00:35:10.864
I- I didn't get
a word of that.

407
00:35:10.944 --> 00:35:15.223
Thrust! Other birds like ducks and geese,
when they take off, what do they have? Thrust.

408
00:35:15.303 --> 00:35:17.982
I swear she ain't
usin' real words.

409
00:35:18.062 --> 00:35:20.901
- She said we need more thrust.
- Oh, thrust.

410
00:35:20.982 --> 00:35:23.501
Well, of course, we need thrust.

411
00:35:23.502 --> 00:35:26.021
Thrust and flying are like this.
That's flying and that's thrust.

412
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.781
- Would you excuse us?
- Aye.

413
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.100
Ah, the wing,
the wing, the wing.

414
00:35:32.179 --> 00:35:34.738
If we don't see some results by tomorrow,
the deal is off, and you're on your own.

415
00:35:34.778 --> 00:35:39.297
No more hiding. The farmers will find
you, and it's back to the circus, flyboy.

416
00:35:39.378 --> 00:35:44.417
You're the first chick I ever met
with the shell still on.

417
00:35:44.497 --> 00:35:49.216
Sleep tight, angel face. The Rock's
on the case.

418
00:35:49.257 --> 00:35:52.215
Ginger!

419
00:35:52.295 --> 00:35:54.135
Whew!

420
00:35:55.735 --> 00:36:00.974
Cock-a-doodle-doo! What, what.

421
00:36:02.254 --> 00:36:05.454
- Oh, it was a beaut, guv'nor.
- Hmm?

422
00:36:05.534 --> 00:36:08.813
A fine piece of work,
If I do says so meself.

423
00:36:08.893 --> 00:36:10.732
- I say so meself too.
- I wish I could have seen it.

424
00:36:10.812 --> 00:36:14.131
We slipped into the farmer's room,
all quiet like.

425
00:36:14.212 --> 00:36:17.171
- Like a fish.
- Yeah, and we-

426
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:21.450
'' Like a fish''?
You stupid Norbert.

427
00:36:21.529 --> 00:36:23.569
Anyway, guv, here it is.

428
00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:26.409
- El merchandiso.
- That's Spanish.

429
00:36:26.489 --> 00:36:30.288
- What are these two crooks doing here?
- So, you know each other.

430
00:36:30.369 --> 00:36:32.568
She don't think
we're valuable.

431
00:36:32.648 --> 00:36:35.208
Guys, you are
without a doubt the sneakiest,

432
00:36:35.288 --> 00:36:37.808
most light-fingered
thieving parasites I've ever met.

433
00:36:37.887 --> 00:36:41.886
- Oh, don't, don't. Stop it.
- I've gone bright red.

434
00:36:41.966 --> 00:36:43.806
So, uh, how about them eggs?

435
00:36:43.886 --> 00:36:46.565
- Eggs? Don't tell me
you promised them- - Yep!

436
00:36:46.605 --> 00:36:48.525
Promised them every egg
I lay this month.

437
00:36:48.605 --> 00:36:51.724
And when can we expect
the first installment?

438
00:36:51.805 --> 00:36:55.004
I'm brewing one up as we speak, guys.
I'll keep you posted.

439
00:36:56.523 --> 00:36:58.962
Pleasure doing business
with you, sir.

440
00:36:59.043 --> 00:37:00.882
Sucker.

441
00:37:02.763 --> 00:37:04.803
- What?
- You've lied to them.

442
00:37:04.882 --> 00:37:08.841
I didn't lie, doll face.
I just... omitted certain truths.

443
00:37:08.921 --> 00:37:10.761
I'll give them exactly
what I promised.

444
00:37:10.841 --> 00:37:13.321
- Which is nothing.
- Which is what I'll give them.

445
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.399
And what
will you give us?

446
00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.079
Thrust!

447
00:37:20.399 --> 00:37:22.919
You okay, sweetheart?Good, good.

448
00:37:25.239 --> 00:37:27.038
Now this is just
a little helper.

449
00:37:27.077 --> 00:37:28.958
Something to get you going.
It's a thrust exercise.

450
00:37:28.997 --> 00:37:32.597
- The tension's killing me.
- It's gonna kill her!

451
00:37:32.637 --> 00:37:35.196
- Release!
- Whoa!

452
00:37:39.276 --> 00:37:41.355
Come on! Flap!

453
00:37:44.434 --> 00:37:47.393
You can do it.
Flap, flap, flap!

454
00:37:51.034 --> 00:37:53.952
Yes, yes, yes!

455
00:37:55.632 --> 00:37:58.712
Is that your first offense?

456
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:12.150
Oops.

457
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:17.188
Roll call!
I haven't laid any eggs.

458
00:38:17.268 --> 00:38:19.388
- Hide me.
- Three days and no tone.

459
00:38:19.468 --> 00:38:22.107
- Oh, no! - Why didn't you
tell us, Babs? - Hide me!

460
00:38:22.187 --> 00:38:23.707
We've been so busy
with the flying-

461
00:38:23.787 --> 00:38:25.467
- They're coming!
- Hide me!

462
00:38:25.507 --> 00:38:28.106
Hide yourself!

463
00:38:35.466 --> 00:38:37.384
Oh!

464
00:39:26.815 --> 00:39:28.695
Double their food rations,
Mr. Tweedy.

465
00:39:28.775 --> 00:39:31.934
I want them all
as fat as this one.

466
00:39:33.014 --> 00:39:34.894
Oh!

467
00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:40.372
All of me life flashed
before me eyes!

468
00:39:40.453 --> 00:39:42.412
It was really borin'.

469
00:39:44.293 --> 00:39:48.331
Chicken feed.
My favorite!

470
00:39:48.411 --> 00:39:50.091
Wait. Wait.

471
00:39:53.611 --> 00:39:55.449
Ooh!

472
00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:58.130
No. Wait!

473
00:40:01.329 --> 00:40:05.288
Babs, please! Bunty!
Stop it! Wait!

474
00:40:05.368 --> 00:40:07.208
Stop!

475
00:40:11.927 --> 00:40:14.446
Stop it!

476
00:40:15.606 --> 00:40:20.325
Something is wrong here.
Can't you see that?

477
00:40:20.365 --> 00:40:22.244
Strange boxes
arrive in the barn.

478
00:40:24.325 --> 00:40:26.603
..and now they're giving us
extra food.

479
00:40:26.644 --> 00:40:29.923
Don't you see what's happening?
They're fattening us up.

480
00:40:30.003 --> 00:40:33.683
They're going to kill us all.

481
00:40:33.763 --> 00:40:37.601
Whoa, whoa! Heavy alert.

482
00:40:37.681 --> 00:40:40.002
- She didn't mean that, gals.
- Do you mind?

483
00:40:40.041 --> 00:40:42.162
Keep eating.
Save some for me.

484
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.802
What are you doing?
How dare you! Let go of me!

485
00:40:43.837 --> 00:40:45.365
Listen. I've met some
hard-boiled eggs in my day,

486
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:50.479
What's that supposed to mean? -
It means you got to lighten up.

487
00:40:53.559 --> 00:40:55.479
Over in America,
we have this rule.

488
00:40:55.518 --> 00:40:58.238
If you want to motivate someone,
don't mention death.

489
00:40:58.318 --> 00:41:01.997
Funny. Over here, the rule is:
Always tell the truth.

490
00:41:02.038 --> 00:41:04.677
That's been working like
a real charm, hasn't it?

491
00:41:04.716 --> 00:41:08.237
Here's some free advice. You want them to
perform? Tell them what they wanna hear.

492
00:41:08.316 --> 00:41:10.676
You mean lie.

493
00:41:10.716 --> 00:41:14.195
Here we go again.
You know what your problem is?

494
00:41:16.315 --> 00:41:20.314
Why? Because I'm honest?
I care about what happens to them,

495
00:41:20.394 --> 00:41:23.633
something I wouldn't expect a lone
free ranger to know anything about.

496
00:41:23.713 --> 00:41:26.313
If this is the way you show it,
I hope you never care about me.

497
00:41:26.353 --> 00:41:29.552
- I can assure you, I
never will. - Good! - Fine!

498
00:42:16.263 --> 00:42:18.103
What's all this?

499
00:42:18.183 --> 00:42:22.222
Well, here she is.
Ask and you shall receive.

500
00:42:22.262 --> 00:42:25.941
- That's biblical.
- That's real craftsmanship is what it is.

501
00:42:25.982 --> 00:42:28.620
- Solid as a rock.
- Ooh!

502
00:42:28.701 --> 00:42:31.461
It's supposed to do that.

503
00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:35.700
- It's perfect, guys.
- And how's that egg coming?

504
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.979
This is a double yolker.

505
00:42:46.818 --> 00:42:49.017
- I don't see what this has to do with-

506
00:42:49.097 --> 00:42:51.377
You will.

507
00:42:51.417 --> 00:42:53.416
We've been workin' too hard.

508
00:42:53.496 --> 00:42:56.056
Time to kick back a bit,
shake those tail feathers.

509
00:42:56.096 --> 00:42:59.614
Look at him.
Nelly podging around like a-

510
00:42:59.695 --> 00:43:01.974
Oh, good heavens.
What's happenin'?

511
00:43:02.055 --> 00:43:06.294
That's called a beat, sister.
Feel it pulsing through your body?

512
00:43:06.373 --> 00:43:09.773
Oh, yes. Pulsing.
Fancy that.

513
00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:12.773
Hey, well,
then go with it, baby.

514
00:43:12.853 --> 00:43:17.252
Oh, my. Look!
I'm going with it!

515
00:43:17.331 --> 00:43:19.971
Bunty, what's got into you?

516
00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.091
Same thing that's got
into you apparently.

517
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.531
# Flip, flop, fly #

518
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:26.810
- # I don't care if I die #
- Just go with the flow, gal!

519
00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:29.250
- # Flip, flop, fly #
- Let it go!

520
00:43:29.289 --> 00:43:31.689
# I don't care if I die #

521
00:43:31.769 --> 00:43:34.809
# Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-bye #

522
00:43:34.888 --> 00:43:37.887
Now, see here. I don't
recall authorizing a hop.

523
00:43:37.968 --> 00:43:39.888
Oh, shut up and dance.

524
00:43:39.968 --> 00:43:43.247
Oh! Oh!

525
00:43:45.486 --> 00:43:50.206
What are you sobbing about, you nancy?

526
00:43:50.285 --> 00:43:55.924
Little moments like this, mate.
It's what makes the job all worthwhile.

527
00:43:59.084 --> 00:44:00.963
Wanna dance?

528
00:44:03.003 --> 00:44:04.843
Yeah, all right.

529
00:44:04.923 --> 00:44:08.361
#Now, give me one more kiss
Hold it along, long time#

530
00:44:08.442 --> 00:44:09.961
Huh?

531
00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:15.080
# Give me one more kiss
Hold it along, long time #

532
00:44:15.161 --> 00:44:17.361
# Love me, baby, till the feelin'
hits my head like wine #

533
00:44:17.441 --> 00:44:19.400
# So fine
So glad you're mine #

534
00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.680
# Flip, flop, fly #

535
00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.359
# I don't care if I die #

536
00:44:24.439 --> 00:44:28.478
# Flip, flop, fly
I don't care if I die #

537
00:44:28.559 --> 00:44:33.118
# Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-bye#

538
00:44:33.198 --> 00:44:36.716
# Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-bye #

539
00:44:36.797 --> 00:44:40.797
# Yeah, don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-bye #

540
00:44:40.876 --> 00:44:43.595
- # Yeah #
- Ooh!

541
00:44:46.395 --> 00:44:50.874
Did ya see that? I flew!

542
00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:53.354
Atta girl, Babsy.
Atta girl.

543
00:44:53.433 --> 00:44:56.792
- Oh! Your wing. It's better.
- Well-

544
00:44:56.872 --> 00:44:59.713
- How about that?
- Fantastic.

545
00:44:59.752 --> 00:45:01.832
You can fly for us
tomorrow.

546
00:45:01.912 --> 00:45:05.271
Uh, uh, yeah, so it seems.

547
00:45:05.352 --> 00:45:07.071
I flew! I flew!

548
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:10.711
Looks like I owe you
an apology.

549
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:14.029
I didn't think you cared about us,
but after all this-

550
00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:16.470
Well, it seems I was wrong.

551
00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:19.469
Hey, easy, Miss Hard-boiled.

552
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:21.707
I might think
you're turning soft.

553
00:45:26.148 --> 00:45:30.346
Uh, listen, there's
something I got to tell ya.

554
00:45:30.427 --> 00:45:32.546
I-

555
00:45:35.586 --> 00:45:40.544
No. You'd better wait here.

556
00:46:02.941 --> 00:46:07.019
Ooh, that's champion,
that is. What is it?

557
00:46:07.099 --> 00:46:09.900
It's a pie machine,
you idiot.

558
00:46:09.979 --> 00:46:12.499
Chickens go in,
pies come out.

559
00:46:12.578 --> 00:46:14.459
Ooh!
What kind of pies?

560
00:46:14.498 --> 00:46:17.097
- Apple.
- My favorite!

561
00:46:17.178 --> 00:46:22.177
Chicken pies, you great lummox!
Imagine it.

562
00:46:22.257 --> 00:46:25.177
In less than a fortnight,
every grocers' in the county...

563
00:46:25.256 --> 00:46:27.655
will be stocked
with box upon box...

564
00:46:27.695 --> 00:46:31.095
of Mrs. Tweedy's
Homemade Chicken Pies.

565
00:46:31.175 --> 00:46:32.655
Just Missus?

566
00:46:32.734 --> 00:46:35.694
Woman's touch. Makes the public
feel more comfortable.

567
00:46:35.774 --> 00:46:39.053
Oh, right.
How does it work?

568
00:46:43.093 --> 00:46:45.612
I know just the one.

569
00:46:48.692 --> 00:46:52.531
I've got a score
to settle with you.

570
00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.651
Bloomin' heck!
They've got Ginger!

571
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.369
We mustn't panic.
We mustn't panic!

572
00:47:03.649 --> 00:47:05.528
Quiet there!

573
00:47:05.569 --> 00:47:09.527
Quiet, I say!
Let's have some discipline, what, what.

574
00:47:09.608 --> 00:47:13.167
The enemy has taken a prisoner.
This calls for retaliation!

575
00:47:13.247 --> 00:47:16.527
- Retaliation!
- What's going on? What's happening?

576
00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:20.366
They got Ginger, Mr. Rhodes.
They're taking her to the chop!

577
00:47:20.445 --> 00:47:24.645
Well, what are you waiting for, laddie?
Fly over there. Save her!

578
00:47:24.686 --> 00:47:28.684
Of course- No, no!
No, that's just what they'd expect.

579
00:47:28.764 --> 00:47:31.004
But I say we give them
the old element of surprise.

580
00:47:31.084 --> 00:47:33.923
And catch Jerry
with his trousers down.

581
00:47:33.964 --> 00:47:36.362
I like the sound of that.
What's the plan?

582
00:47:36.443 --> 00:47:38.722
The plan- The plan.

583
00:47:38.763 --> 00:47:40.682
The plan- Uh, Babs!

584
00:47:40.761 --> 00:47:43.562
Give me that thing.
Bunty, give me a boost.

585
00:47:54.999 --> 00:47:56.839
Whoa.

586
00:47:56.919 --> 00:47:59.359
Look at the size
of that thing.

587
00:48:02.997 --> 00:48:04.598
Oh, no!

588
00:48:05.836 --> 00:48:08.197
Chickens go in,

589
00:48:08.237 --> 00:48:10.236
pies come out.

590
00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:15.156
Chicken pies.

591
00:48:15.235 --> 00:48:17.035
Not-
Not apple pies.

592
00:48:17.115 --> 00:48:18.555
Chicken!

593
00:48:25.674 --> 00:48:27.753
Oh, great.
Brilliant!

594
00:48:27.833 --> 00:48:30.153
- Yo, baby doll!
- Rocky!

595
00:48:30.233 --> 00:48:31.873
- I'm coming!
- Hurry!

596
00:48:32.952 --> 00:48:35.432
- I'm still coming!
- Come on!

597
00:48:35.511 --> 00:48:38.951
- Stop this thing!
- I'm gettin' there!

598
00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:42.991
Oh, shoot!

599
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:45.310
Rocky!

600
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:47.590
I'll be down before you can say...

601
00:48:48.229 --> 00:48:49.709
mixed vegetables!

602
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:52.349
Aaaah!

603
00:48:54.348 --> 00:48:56.628
Aaah! Ohh!

604
00:48:59.067 --> 00:49:02.266
Whoa-ohh-ohh-ohh!

605
00:49:08.465 --> 00:49:10.345
Whoa-ohh-ohh!

606
00:49:10.425 --> 00:49:12.105
D- oh!
Get it?

607
00:49:12.185 --> 00:49:14.464
- Dough!
- I'm stuck!

608
00:49:14.543 --> 00:49:16.384
Nothing to it.
Oops.

609
00:49:25.502 --> 00:49:27.142
Ohh! Oh!

610
00:49:32.021 --> 00:49:33.660
Hang on!

611
00:49:38.019 --> 00:49:39.260
Look out!

612
00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.858
Whoa!

613
00:49:54.217 --> 00:49:56.776
Hey! Aha!

614
00:50:02.015 --> 00:50:03.855
Yes!

615
00:50:11.014 --> 00:50:12.893
Oh, it's like
an oven in here.

616
00:50:21.691 --> 00:50:23.291
Come on!

617
00:50:23.371 --> 00:50:25.531
Wait up!
I'm com-

618
00:50:26.651 --> 00:50:28.050
Don't leave-

619
00:50:28.691 --> 00:50:30.810
Get over to the-

620
00:50:40.687 --> 00:50:43.007
The door! Come on!

621
00:51:05.483 --> 00:51:07.563
She's gonna blow!
Run!

622
00:51:10.202 --> 00:51:12.883
Huh?

623
00:51:12.922 --> 00:51:15.281
What did you do,
you great pudding?

624
00:51:15.361 --> 00:51:17.201
I didn't do 'owt!

625
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.079
- Turn it off!
- It won't turn off!

626
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:51.810
- Ouch!

627
00:51:52.111 --> 00:51:53.610
- We've got to show
the others. Come on.

628
00:52:02.913 --> 00:52:05.152
Look! I fixed it!

629
00:52:05.192 --> 00:52:06.872
Huh?

630
00:52:09.511 --> 00:52:12.391
- Chicken pies?
- Ohh! - Oh, no!

631
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:15.271
- Yes, but-
- I don't want to be a pie.

632
00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:18.430
I don't like gravy.

633
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:21.590
Ladies, please.
Let's not lose our heads.

634
00:52:21.669 --> 00:52:23.548
Lose our heads?

635
00:52:31.226 --> 00:52:34.987
What I meant to say was, Rocky sabotaged
the machine and bought us more time.

636
00:52:36.986 --> 00:52:39.745
And better still,
he's going to fly for us tomorrow.

637
00:52:39.786 --> 00:52:43.065
And once we've seen how's it done,
we'll get it.

638
00:52:43.145 --> 00:52:44.985
So don't worry,

639
00:52:45.065 --> 00:52:48.864
because tomorrow everything's going
to go much, much smoother.

640
00:52:57.701 --> 00:53:00.182
All right, Pops,
what did I do now?

641
00:53:00.262 --> 00:53:02.581
A very brave
and honorable deed, sir.

642
00:53:04.621 --> 00:53:08.061
In the light
of your action this evening, I-

643
00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:11.779
I dutifully admit that
I have misjudged your character.

644
00:53:13.339 --> 00:53:17.379
So I present you with this
medal for bravery.

645
00:53:17.418 --> 00:53:19.299
And...

646
00:53:19.338 --> 00:53:21.658
I salute you.

647
00:53:23.818 --> 00:53:25.457
In honor
of the occasion,

648
00:53:25.498 --> 00:53:28.577
I surrender the bunk
entirely.

649
00:53:28.617 --> 00:53:31.616
I shall sleep under the stars.

650
00:53:33.536 --> 00:53:37.375
Oh, uh, I await tomorrow's
flying demonstration...

651
00:53:37.454 --> 00:53:39.933
with great anticipation.

652
00:53:42.494 --> 00:53:44.853
You and me both, Pops.

653
00:53:53.412 --> 00:53:55.411
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. Were you-

654
00:53:55.491 --> 00:53:57.811
- Is this your- I'll get down.
- No, no, it's just-

655
00:53:57.891 --> 00:53:59.891
- Since you're here-
- No, I'm glad you're here, because-

656
00:53:59.971 --> 00:54:01.810
- I'm sorry. You go first.
- You go ahead. I'll-

657
00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:06.170
Um, I just wanted
to say...

658
00:54:06.249 --> 00:54:09.049
I may have been
a bit harsh at first.

659
00:54:09.129 --> 00:54:12.369
Well,
what I really mean is,

660
00:54:12.408 --> 00:54:14.287
thank you...

661
00:54:14.327 --> 00:54:16.687
for saving my life.

662
00:54:16.768 --> 00:54:19.406
For saving our lives.

663
00:54:19.487 --> 00:54:21.486
You know,

664
00:54:21.527 --> 00:54:23.406
I come up here
every night...

665
00:54:23.446 --> 00:54:27.405
and look out to that hill and just imagine
what it must be like on the other side.

666
00:54:27.486 --> 00:54:29.844
It's funny, I've-

667
00:54:29.925 --> 00:54:33.244
I've never actually felt
grass beneath my feet.

668
00:54:33.324 --> 00:54:35.164
I'm sorry.

669
00:54:35.244 --> 00:54:38.444
Here I am rambling on about hills
and grass, and you had something to say.

670
00:54:38.483 --> 00:54:40.363
Uh, y-y-yeah.

671
00:54:40.403 --> 00:54:44.322
Um, it's just that,
y- you know,

672
00:54:44.402 --> 00:54:48.442
life as I've experienced it,
you know, out there,

673
00:54:48.522 --> 00:54:50.761
lone free rangin' and stuff,
it's, uh,

674
00:54:50.841 --> 00:54:53.760
it's full of disappointments
and, uh-

675
00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.560
What, you mean grass isn't
all it's cracked up to be?

676
00:54:56.599 --> 00:54:58.480
Grass!
Exactly. Grass.

677
00:54:58.519 --> 00:55:01.359
It's always greener
on the other side.

678
00:55:01.398 --> 00:55:05.797
And then you get there
and it's brown and prickly.

679
00:55:05.878 --> 00:55:07.837
You see
what I'm tryin' to say?

680
00:55:10.917 --> 00:55:13.756
What I'm trying to say is,

681
00:55:16.036 --> 00:55:19.355
you're welcome.

682
00:55:19.396 --> 00:55:21.275
You know,

683
00:55:21.316 --> 00:55:26.073
that hill is looking closer tonight
than it ever has before.

684
00:55:27.593 --> 00:55:29.633
Oh!

685
00:55:29.714 --> 00:55:33.753
Well, good night... Rocky.

686
00:55:35.273 --> 00:55:37.632
Good night... Ginger.

687
00:56:00.708 --> 00:56:04.227
Company, attention!

688
00:56:09.026 --> 00:56:11.665
Well, today's the day, girls.
We're going to fly!

689
00:56:14.425 --> 00:56:17.624
Finally, we get to see
a real professional in action.

690
00:56:17.704 --> 00:56:20.504
Better start warming up.
I'll go and get him.

691
00:56:20.584 --> 00:56:22.863
Rocky. Knock-knock.

692
00:56:22.944 --> 00:56:25.742
Everyone's waiting,
so I told them to-

693
00:56:30.302 --> 00:56:32.181
R- Rocky?

694
00:58:11.284 --> 00:58:13.723
Oh, a cannon.

695
00:58:13.762 --> 00:58:15.722
Aye, that would
give you thrust.

696
00:58:15.803 --> 00:58:17.762
I knew he was fake
all along.

697
00:58:17.841 --> 00:58:21.761
In fact, I'm not even certain
he was American.

698
00:58:21.841 --> 00:58:24.480
So, what's
the next plan, hen?

699
00:58:24.561 --> 00:58:26.400
Let's face it.

700
00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.279
The only way out of here
is wrapped in pastry.

701
00:58:30.959 --> 00:58:33.119
Perhaps he just
went on holiday.

702
00:58:33.199 --> 00:58:36.319
Perhaps he just went to get away
from your infernal knitting!

703
00:58:36.359 --> 00:58:39.198
Ohh! Ohh!

704
00:58:39.238 --> 00:58:42.437
You were the one that was always
hitting him. See how you like it.

705
00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:45.237
Don't push me, four-eyes!

706
00:58:45.316 --> 00:58:48.276
Quiet there!

707
00:58:48.356 --> 00:58:50.236
Quiet, I say!

708
00:58:50.276 --> 00:58:53.795
Dissension in the ranks.
Precisely what Jerry would have wanted.

709
00:58:53.875 --> 00:58:55.474
The old
divide and conquer.

710
00:58:55.555 --> 00:58:59.554
A proper squadron work together,
like we did in my R.A.F. days.

711
00:58:59.634 --> 00:59:02.434
Jocko at the stick,
Flappy at the map...

712
00:59:02.513 --> 00:59:04.832
and old Whizzbang
at the tail-end Charlie.

713
00:59:04.913 --> 00:59:08.032
WingCo would give the call,
hop in the old crate, chocks away!

714
00:59:08.112 --> 00:59:11.231
Wizard show it was.
That's how you get medals.

715
00:59:11.271 --> 00:59:15.231
Will you shut up about
your stupid blooming medals!

716
00:59:15.311 --> 00:59:17.470
Ooh!

717
00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:21.949
Ohh!

718
00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:24.029
How dare you!

719
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:26.349
Madam, forgive me.

720
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:28.388
A- As an officer,
I offer my most-

721
00:59:44.185 --> 00:59:46.025
Fowler?

722
00:59:49.065 --> 00:59:51.424
Everyone, shut up!

723
00:59:52.824 --> 00:59:54.464
Eh?

724
00:59:59.942 --> 01:00:02.223
Fowler.

725
01:00:02.302 --> 01:00:04.461
What exactly is
the R.A.F.?

726
01:00:04.542 --> 01:00:06.862
What do you mean,
what is it?

727
01:00:06.941 --> 01:00:09.380
The Royal Air Force is what.

728
01:00:09.461 --> 01:00:12.700
Then what's
the ''old crate''?

729
01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.939
Ahh!
There she is.

730
01:00:18.939 --> 01:00:20.739
Gorgeous,
isn't she?

731
01:00:20.778 --> 01:00:23.618
You mean, you flew
in one of these?

732
01:00:23.658 --> 01:00:26.977
Beautifully built. In fact, there's
a bit of a story to that as well.

733
01:00:27.058 --> 01:00:28.897
We were out on a ''recce,''
you see.

734
01:00:28.977 --> 01:00:31.777
Ops had given the go-ahead,
but the weather duffed up.

735
01:00:31.857 --> 01:00:34.616
Yes. Of course.

736
01:00:34.656 --> 01:00:37.495
We might actually be able
to pull this off.

737
01:00:37.576 --> 01:00:40.774
- We're still going to fly out of here.
- What, what?

738
01:00:40.815 --> 01:00:42.615
Fowler's
provided the answer.

739
01:00:42.694 --> 01:00:44.534
I have?

740
01:00:44.613 --> 01:00:47.373
Uh, yes, yes, yes.
Of course I have.

741
01:00:47.454 --> 01:00:49.292
Uh, how have I?

742
01:00:49.373 --> 01:00:51.252
We'll make...

743
01:00:51.293 --> 01:00:53.172
a crate.

744
01:00:53.213 --> 01:00:55.852
Mac, you'll handle the engineering.

745
01:00:56.892 --> 01:00:58.572
Babs, manufacturing.

746
01:00:58.651 --> 01:01:00.771
Fowler will be
Chief aviation advisor.

747
01:01:00.851 --> 01:01:02.411
Bunty, eggs.

748
01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:04.010
- Eggs?
- Eggs.

749
01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:07.090
Right, just like the ones
that rooster was gonna lay.

750
01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:09.969
Only roosters don't lay eggs,
do they?

751
01:01:10.049 --> 01:01:12.849
- Don't they?
- No, it's a lady thing, apparently.

752
01:01:12.928 --> 01:01:14.769
Ask your mum.

753
01:01:14.848 --> 01:01:18.048
One egg for every item on the list.
First payment in advance.

754
01:01:18.128 --> 01:01:20.167
Right! When do we start?

755
01:01:20.248 --> 01:01:22.086
Come on!

756
01:01:23.127 --> 01:01:25.007
Hey.

757
01:01:25.047 --> 01:01:27.405
- Oh!

758
01:01:30.485 --> 01:01:33.044
Huh?

759
01:01:33.084 --> 01:01:34.964
What the dickens?

760
01:01:36.404 --> 01:01:39.243
Oh, gnomes now.

761
01:01:43.683 --> 01:01:46.043
Voila!

762
01:01:46.082 --> 01:01:48.922
Give me.

763
01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.240
Hmm?

764
01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.359
Aah!

765
01:02:16.357 --> 01:02:19.757
- Ohh!
- All right, here.

766
01:02:28.714 --> 01:02:30.793
Eggs from heaven!

767
01:02:30.874 --> 01:02:33.912
No! From her bum!

768
01:03:00.149 --> 01:03:01.988
Mmm?

769
01:03:03.788 --> 01:03:07.067
- Idiot!
- That was close.

770
01:03:07.106 --> 01:03:09.067
Too close.

771
01:03:09.147 --> 01:03:11.866
We can't stop now.
Come on, everyone! Go for it!

772
01:03:11.946 --> 01:03:14.866
Really go for it!
Go, go, go, go!

773
01:03:17.145 --> 01:03:19.464
- Mac, we need those
calculations quickly. - Uh-huh.

774
01:03:19.545 --> 01:03:22.145
Agnes, that has to be
really secure.

775
01:03:22.225 --> 01:03:24.504
- Careful up there, Fowler!
- Roger!

776
01:03:25.543 --> 01:03:27.383
Bunty,
give him a hand.

777
01:03:27.463 --> 01:03:29.182
Well done, Babs.
Keep it up.

778
01:03:29.263 --> 01:03:31.503
No problem, doll face.

779
01:03:46.059 --> 01:03:48.899
# Oh, I'm the type of guy #

780
01:03:48.979 --> 01:03:50.858
# That likes
to roam around #

781
01:03:50.939 --> 01:03:52.818
# I'm never in one place #

782
01:03:52.899 --> 01:03:55.498
# I roam from town to town #

783
01:03:55.537 --> 01:03:58.937
# And when I found myself
fallin' for some girl #

784
01:03:59.017 --> 01:04:00.897
# I'd hop
right in that car- #

785
01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:02.817
# And travel 'round the world #

786
01:04:02.857 --> 01:04:05.056
# 'Cause I'm a wanderer #

787
01:04:05.136 --> 01:04:06.936
# Yeah
A wanderer #

788
01:04:07.016 --> 01:04:09.335
# I roam around and 'round
Around and 'round #

789
01:04:11.335 --> 01:04:12.694
# 'Cause
I'm a wanderer #

790
01:04:12.775 --> 01:04:14.254
# Yeah, a wanderer #

791
01:04:14.334 --> 01:04:15.734
Oh, boy.

792
01:04:15.774 --> 01:04:18.054
# I roam around and 'round
Around and 'round, around #

793
01:04:21.653 --> 01:04:23.372
Come on.

794
01:04:25.692 --> 01:04:27.532
Please.

795
01:04:30.771 --> 01:04:34.051
Oh, no.
He's fixed it.

796
01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:41.889
Get the chickens.

797
01:04:41.969 --> 01:04:43.528
Which ones?

798
01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:46.128
All of them.

799
01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:55.487
Me tools!

800
01:04:55.527 --> 01:04:58.206
Why, you thieving
little buggers!

801
01:04:58.246 --> 01:05:00.606
What's the plan?

802
01:05:03.964 --> 01:05:05.644
- Attack!
- Huh?

803
01:05:07.524 --> 01:05:08.764
Nice plan.

804
01:05:10.283 --> 01:05:12.483
Mrs. Tweedy!

805
01:05:14.843 --> 01:05:17.803
Aaaah!
Mrs. Tweedy!

806
01:05:17.882 --> 01:05:20.242
The chickens
are revolting!

807
01:05:20.282 --> 01:05:22.482
Finally,
something we agree on.

808
01:05:23.481 --> 01:05:25.201
Help! Mrs.-

809
01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.920
Mmm- Mmm?

810
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.600
Under the hut.

811
01:05:31.641 --> 01:05:35.358
- Come on!

812
01:05:39.159 --> 01:05:41.797
- What have we done?
- This is it, everyone.

813
01:05:41.878 --> 01:05:43.757
We're escaping.

814
01:05:43.798 --> 01:05:46.037
- What, now?
- Now!

815
01:05:46.117 --> 01:05:49.076
- But, Ginger, she's not ready.
- Listen.

816
01:05:49.156 --> 01:05:52.157
We'll either die free chickens
or die trying.

817
01:05:54.356 --> 01:05:56.475
Are those
the only choices?

818
01:05:56.556 --> 01:05:58.915
- Let's do it.
- Scramble!

819
01:06:11.752 --> 01:06:13.592
This way!

820
01:06:45.705 --> 01:06:48.505
Mrs. Tweedy!

821
01:06:49.666 --> 01:06:52.465
The exits are located
here and here.

822
01:06:52.545 --> 01:06:55.384
In the quite likely event
of an emergency,

823
01:06:55.424 --> 01:06:57.304
put your head
between your knees and-

824
01:06:57.344 --> 01:06:59.343
Kiss your bum good-bye.

825
01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:01.463
All right, Fowler,
ready for takeoff.

826
01:07:01.543 --> 01:07:04.182
Behind you
all the way.

827
01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:07.941
But you're
supposed to be up there.

828
01:07:08.022 --> 01:07:09.621
You're the pilot.

829
01:07:09.662 --> 01:07:13.781
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I can't fly this contraption.

830
01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:16.820
Back in your day-
the Royal Air Force-

831
01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.659
6-4-4 Squadron,
poultry division.

832
01:07:19.699 --> 01:07:21.579
We were the mascots.

833
01:07:21.619 --> 01:07:24.099
You mean you never
actually flew the plane?

834
01:07:24.179 --> 01:07:26.017
Good heavens, no.

835
01:07:26.098 --> 01:07:28.458
I'm a chicken.

836
01:07:28.538 --> 01:07:33.418
The Royal Air Force doesn't let chickens
behind the controls of a complex aircraft.

837
01:07:33.497 --> 01:07:35.857
We're all gonna die!

838
01:07:35.896 --> 01:07:37.776
Fowler,
you have to fly it.

839
01:07:37.816 --> 01:07:40.936
You're always talking about back
in your day. Well, today is your day.

840
01:07:43.334 --> 01:07:46.334
You can do it,
You old sausage.

841
01:07:48.093 --> 01:07:50.173
Wing Commander
T.I. Fowler...

842
01:07:50.254 --> 01:07:52.093
reporting for duty.

843
01:07:54.613 --> 01:07:57.412
Well, come on.
What are you waiting for?

844
01:07:57.492 --> 01:08:01.172
We haven't got all day.
Let's get this crate off the ground.

845
01:08:01.212 --> 01:08:02.571
Fowler! Now!

846
01:08:02.651 --> 01:08:04.931
Roger! Contact!

847
01:08:16.409 --> 01:08:18.249
Cleared for takeoff!

848
01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:28.646
Chocks away!

849
01:08:28.726 --> 01:08:30.726
Whoa!

850
01:08:35.806 --> 01:08:39.524
- Full throttle!
- Full throttle!

851
01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.040
We need more power!

852
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:06.239
I cannot work miracles, Cap'n!
We're givin' her all she's got!

853
01:09:14.918 --> 01:09:18.117
- Gotcha!
- Hard right!

854
01:09:19.877 --> 01:09:21.357
Oh, mother!

855
01:09:26.435 --> 01:09:28.996
Turn her around.
I'll get the ramp.

856
01:09:37.514 --> 01:09:40.114
Aaah!

857
01:09:42.072 --> 01:09:44.592
Put the ramp down.

858
01:09:47.632 --> 01:09:49.711
You are going to be
a pie!

859
01:09:53.391 --> 01:09:57.429
Ginger!

860
01:09:57.509 --> 01:10:00.588
Rocky!

861
01:10:07.108 --> 01:10:08.667
Heads up!

862
01:10:20.985 --> 01:10:23.310
Look out!

863
01:10:23.345 --> 01:10:25.824
- Aah!
- Clear the runway!

864
01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.660
Ginger! Let's go!

865
01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.699
We're flying!

866
01:11:05.657 --> 01:11:08.297
- Aah!
- That's for leaving.

867
01:11:08.336 --> 01:11:09.695
Eew.

868
01:11:09.776 --> 01:11:12.696
And this
is for coming back.

869
01:11:14.335 --> 01:11:16.215
- Whoa!
- Uhh!

870
01:11:16.255 --> 01:11:19.254
Great Scot! What was that?

871
01:11:19.334 --> 01:11:23.653
A cling-on, Cap'n!
And the engines can't take it!

872
01:11:27.252 --> 01:11:28.932
Oh, goodness.

873
01:11:28.973 --> 01:11:30.332
Babs! Scissors!

874
01:11:32.492 --> 01:11:33.851
Bingo.

875
01:11:33.932 --> 01:11:35.491
Lower me down.

876
01:11:35.572 --> 01:11:37.131
- But, Ginger, I-
- Just do it.

877
01:11:37.211 --> 01:11:39.490
Increase velocity!

878
01:11:39.571 --> 01:11:43.170
- What does that mean?
- It means pedal your flippin' giblets out!

879
01:11:55.527 --> 01:11:57.767
- Lower!
- I'm trying!

880
01:12:01.846 --> 01:12:04.005
- Aah!
- Aaah!

881
01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:06.406
Fowler, look out!

882
01:12:13.964 --> 01:12:16.683
- Whoa!
- Oh! Ginger!

883
01:12:25.682 --> 01:12:27.440
Fire! Fire!

884
01:12:29.881 --> 01:12:32.280
Me eggs.

885
01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.280
No!

886
01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:40.599
Blea-aah!

887
01:12:40.639 --> 01:12:42.398
More ammo!
Hurry!

888
01:12:42.479 --> 01:12:44.597
- We got no more eggs!
- Ginger!

889
01:12:44.678 --> 01:12:47.197
Look out!

890
01:12:54.196 --> 01:12:57.556
No!

891
01:13:08.753 --> 01:13:11.192
- Huh?
- Bye-bye.

892
01:13:11.273 --> 01:13:14.272
- Aaah!
- Bombs away!

893
01:13:14.352 --> 01:13:17.073
Mr. Tweedy!

894
01:13:17.152 --> 01:13:19.551
Oh, that was good.
That was good!

895
01:13:21.832 --> 01:13:24.191
The old bird bought it!

896
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:27.790
Mrs. Tweedy!
Mrs. Twee-

897
01:13:45.067 --> 01:13:46.946
Whoa!

898
01:13:58.664 --> 01:14:02.223
I told you
they was organized.

899
01:14:12.261 --> 01:14:14.141
We did it, everyone!

900
01:14:26.459 --> 01:14:27.979
Ha, ha, ha, ha-

901
01:14:33.057 --> 01:14:34.418
Aww! 106201:17:42.899->
01:17:45.197- Whoa!

902
01:14:36.777 --> 01:14:39.617
Keep peddling! We 're not there yet!

903
01:14:43.215 --> 01:14:46.654
You can't see paradise
if you don't pedal!

904
01:14:48.974 --> 01:14:51.454
Put your drumsticks
into it!

905
01:14:55.134 --> 01:14:57.492
That's what I told him,
what, what.

906
01:14:57.573 --> 01:15:01.133
We were losing altitude, you see,
and heading for a fearful prang.

907
01:15:01.212 --> 01:15:03.531
This is a lovely holiday.

908
01:15:03.612 --> 01:15:05.451
I'll be sad to go back.

909
01:15:05.532 --> 01:15:08.330
Safety at all times
is imperative.

910
01:15:08.371 --> 01:15:10.250
Now,
wind 'er up and...

911
01:15:10.291 --> 01:15:12.170
- Whee!
- let 'er go!

912
01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:14.171
So...

913
01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:16.089
is it as good
as you imagined?

914
01:15:16.169 --> 01:15:18.209
No.

915
01:15:18.289 --> 01:15:21.328
It's better.

916
01:15:21.409 --> 01:15:24.688
Come on. I'll show you
how to play cricket.

917
01:15:28.367 --> 01:15:30.526
'Ey, 'ey, here 's a thought.

918
01:15:30.567 --> 01:15:33.686
Why don't we get an egg
And start our own chicken farm?

919
01:15:33.766 --> 01:15:36.565
That way we'll have
all the eggs we could eat.

920
01:15:36.646 --> 01:15:39.006
Right.
We'll need a chicken then.

921
01:15:39.085 --> 01:15:40.845
No.
No, we'll need an egg.

922
01:15:40.925 --> 01:15:44.204
You have the egg first.
That's where you get the chicken from.

923
01:15:44.243 --> 01:15:47.084
No, that's cobblers. If you don't have
a chicken, where you gonna get an egg?

924
01:15:47.163 --> 01:15:49.964
From the chicken
that comes from the egg.

925
01:15:50.043 --> 01:15:52.843
Yeah, but you have to have
an egg to have a chicken.

926
01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:55.722
Yeah, but you gotta get
the chicken first to get the egg,

927
01:15:55.802 --> 01:15:58.602
and then the egg-
you get the chicken out.

928
01:15:58.681 --> 01:16:01.001
Hang on.
Let's go over this again.

929
01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.639
Yeow!

930
01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.358
All right.

931
01:16:12.439 --> 01:16:14.479
Yeah.

932
01:16:14.558 --> 01:16:17.798
# When I get the blues
gon' get me a rockin 'chair#

933
01:16:19.198 --> 01:16:20.937
# When I get the blues
gon' get me a rockin 'chair#

934
01:16:20.938 --> 01:16:28.476
When the blues overtake me#
# Gonna rock on away from here, Ohh #

935
01:16:28.556 --> 01:16:31.555
# Here comes my baby
flashin 'a new gold tooth #

936
01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:36.354
# Here comes my baby
flashin 'anew gold tooth #

937
01:16:37.474 --> 01:16:38.673
# Yeah, she's so small #

938
01:16:38.754 --> 01:16:40.913
# She can rumba
in a pay phone booth #

939
01:16:40.994 --> 01:16:42.473
That's the truth.
Ha-ha!

940
01:16:42.513 --> 01:16:44.633
# Flip, flop, fly #

941
01:16:44.673 --> 01:16:46.992
# I don't care if I die #

942
01:16:47.072 --> 01:16:49.272
# Flip, flop, fly#

943
01:16:49.312 --> 01:16:51.391
# I don't care if I die #

944
01:16:51.471 --> 01:16:55.231
# Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-bye #

945
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:56.631
Yeow!

946
01:17:24.625 --> 01:17:26.905
#Now, give me one more kiss#

947
01:17:26.985 --> 01:17:30.144
# And hold it
along, long time #

948
01:17:30.185 --> 01:17:31.544
# Give me one more kiss#

949
01:17:31.624 --> 01:17:35.063
# And hold it
along, long time#

950
01:17:35.143 --> 01:17:37.743
# Love me, baby, till the feelin'
hits my head like wine#

951
01:17:37.823 --> 01:17:39.822
# So fine
So glad you're mine #

952
01:17:39.902 --> 01:17:42.062
# Flip, flop, fly #

953
01:17:42.142 --> 01:17:44.301
# I don't care if I die #

954
01:17:44.341 --> 01:17:46.581
# Flip, flop, fly #

955
01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:48.901
# I don't care if I die #

956
01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:53.500
# Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-bye #

957
01:17:53.541 --> 01:17:56.219
# Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-bye#

958
01:17:58.259 --> 01:18:01.419
# Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-bye##

959
01:18:01.498 --> 01:18:02.538
Yeah!

960
01:18:02.618 --> 01:18:03.977
Bye-bye!

961
01:19:20.403 --> 01:19:22.283
The egg, obviously.

962
01:19:22.323 --> 01:19:24.202
Rollin 'along,
happy as Larry.

963
01:19:24.242 --> 01:19:27.082
Then, crack!
Hatches into the first chicken.

964
01:19:27.122 --> 01:19:29.961
Yeah, but where 'd
the egg come from, then?

965
01:19:30.042 --> 01:19:32.321
What do you mean,
where 'd it come from?

966
01:19:32.361 --> 01:19:34.681
Egg comes rollin' along, happy as Larry.

967
01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:37.120
It's wonderin'
where 'd it come from?

968
01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.960
Without a chicken, you get
no egg to come rollin 'along.

969
01:19:40.039 --> 01:19:42.840
Well, conversely, without
an egg to hatch into the chicken,

970
01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.719
there will be no chicken to lay the
other egg that hatches into the chicken...

971
01:19:45.799 --> 01:19:48.158
that lays the egg
I mentioned in the first place.

972
01:19:48.198 --> 01:19:51.478
- So w e got two eggs now?
- - No, we 're still talking about the very first egg.

973
01:19:51.558 --> 01:19:54.877
- But what happened about the very first chicken?
- He's in the very first egg!

974
01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:57.757
- Aren't you listenin'?
- Uh, guys. Guys?

975
01:19:57.836 --> 01:20:00.155
Tryin' to enjoy paradise
Over here.

976
01:20:00.236 --> 01:20:02.195
- Oh, sorry, guv.
- Beg your pardon.

977
01:20:02.276 --> 01:20:05.275
- Won't happen again.
- Thanks.

978
01:20:05.354 --> 01:20:07.515
- Git face.
- Pillock.

979
01:20:07.595 --> 01:20:10.914
Thinks he's such a big shot
'cause he's go this name on a poster.

980
01:20:10.955 --> 01:20:13.274
These showbiz folk
are all the same.

981
01:20:13.353 --> 01:20:16.153
- Yeah, the rats are the stars, actually.
- Yeah, of course they are.

982
01:20:16.233 --> 01:20:19.032
- We do all the work, he gets all the credit.
- But he does get all the birds.

983
01:20:19.112 --> 01:20:21.111
- He gets everything.
- Yes, he does. Everything.

984
01:20:21.192 --> 01:20:23.072
- You said it, mate.
- I know.
