00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.407
Hi.

2
00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:51.177
Hi. Good to see you. Yeah. Welcome
to the club. Good to see you again.

3
00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:52.979
Yes. How are you?

4
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.715
Thank you for coming.

5
00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:56.970
- Hi, guys.
- Congratulations.

6
00:01:56.984 --> 00:02:00.587
- Enjoy tonight, will you? Thanks.
- Wonderful. Great.

7
00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:02.689
Good to see you. Glad you could make it.

8
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.715
Come on in. Have a good time.

9
00:02:27.548 --> 00:02:30.779
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

10
00:02:34.088 --> 00:02:37.190
Twenty years ago, these people
wouldn't even let me in their homes.

11
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:39.726
Now they'd elect me governor.

12
00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:43.930
Smile for the newspapers, Quentin.
It's the only thing in Tampa I don't own.

13
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:45.799
Well, not yet.

14
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.868
- How's your drink?
- Perfect.

15
00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.359
Where are the twins?

16
00:02:57.278 --> 00:03:01.703
There's some idle chit-chat about you
and a Russian boat.

17
00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:06.411
Father would disapprove.

18
00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:11.224
Well, Father doesn't need to know.

19
00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:14.817
- Go with him.
- No.

20
00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:20.793
It's my deal.

21
00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:55.869
So I'm gonna get a 3-to-1 return
on my money?

22
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.404
Bobby, he's the real deal.

23
00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:00.607
I met him at a hash bar in Amsterdam.

24
00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:05.411
He speaks Russian, German, Arabic...

25
00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:09.449
Mr. Astrov's trust is not gained easily.

26
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.953
Two years it took me.
You see, Micky, he doesn't like new faces.

27
00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:17.857
So tell me, why am I looking at a new face?

28
00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.326
Otto Krieg, meet my friend, Bobby.

29
00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:25.728
He's helping me with the financing.
He's not a cop.

30
00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:52.483
Let's see the money.

31
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.175
You like it?

32
00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:44.110
Yeah, I like it.

33
00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:45.712
We have deal?

34
00:05:45.813 --> 00:05:49.180
We have deal.

35
00:06:00.494 --> 00:06:02.028
- Bring them down!
- Move!

36
00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:05.121
Move in!

37
00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:14.634
<i>This is the FBI. Put your hands in the air.</i>

38
00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:15.842
What is this?

39
00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:18.578
You brought a cop, Micky,
and he brought his fucking friends!

40
00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:19.912
Don't look at me.

41
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.245
This is not good. My father's gonna kill me.

42
00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:28.518
You're under arrest for the importation
and sale of contraband firearms.

43
00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.625
- Gun! Gun!
- Drop the gun!

44
00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:37.026
- Drop the gun!
- Shoot him!

45
00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:41.464
Otto!

46
00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:44.637
This is not my deal.

47
00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:49.436
This is not my deal!
I don't even know these guys!

48
00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:56.683
Cease fire!

49
00:06:56.784 --> 00:07:00.584
Team Two, let's go.

50
00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:05.425
Holy shit.

51
00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:09.121
Holy shit.

52
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.665
Bobby.

53
00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:15.134
Bobby.

54
00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:18.432
Stay down.

55
00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:32.352
I'm calling it. It's 1:37 a.m.

56
00:07:32.453 --> 00:07:36.116
Bag him and ship him.

57
00:07:56.743 --> 00:08:00.304
God, I hate this job.

58
00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:05.184
- Give me a hand, fellows.
- Yeah.

59
00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:07.620
Hurry up, Frank,
we gotta get you out of here.

60
00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:11.057
- What the hell happened? Who's the kid?
- Well, it was definitely not in the plan.

61
00:08:11.058 --> 00:08:13.159
- But we beat the spread.
- This isn't football.

62
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:19.332
- Yeah, it's a figure of speech.
- People weren't supposed to die out there.

63
00:08:19.433 --> 00:08:22.135
Get them ID'd and get them to the morgue.

64
00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:27.006
- And get me my pants!
- Can we get some pants over here?

65
00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:32.704
- Ah, shit.
- Surprise!

66
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.885
To Frank Castle...

67
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.789
the finest soldier, the finest undercover op,
the finest man I've ever known.

68
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.825
What am I gonna do without you?

69
00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:49.395
Get a girlfriend.

70
00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:52.131
You son of a bitch. Never do that again.

71
00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:54.267
Remember that watch you gave me
13 years ago?

72
00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:56.035
Small payment for saving my life.

73
00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:58.104
Hell, that Iraqi would have missed anyway.

74
00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:01.774
It was sweet for you to wait, Jim.

75
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:05.478
Here. Now we both have one, Frank.

76
00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:11.176
Jesus, Jimmy.

77
00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:15.087
Have fun in Puerto Rico, man.
Say hello to your folks.

78
00:09:15.188 --> 00:09:18.350
Thanks.

79
00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:22.491
Agent Weeks.

80
00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:27.490
He's Robert Saint. Howard Saint's son.

81
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.636
More paperwork for Tampa PD.

82
00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.738
No, we can handle this.

83
00:09:32.839 --> 00:09:35.274
- Stay out of the casino!
- What, me?

84
00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:37.510
- See you, fellas!
- See you, buddy!

85
00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:40.637
Come on.

86
00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:37.796
Bail him out. Bring him to the club.

87
00:10:50.717 --> 00:10:52.084
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

88
00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:56.178
- Hey, Micky.
- Don't hit me.

89
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.806
You sell homegrown pot by the ounce,
Micky, not by the barrel.

90
00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:17.009
You sell badly forged fake passports
to Haitians.

91
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.778
So what inspired you to become

92
00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:23.249
the Mr. Universe
of international arms dealers?

93
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.153
Micky, you should apologize for the death
of Mr. Saint's youngest child.

94
00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:29.288
Okay, I know how it looks.

95
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:31.657
But Bobby, he buys pot from me.

96
00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:35.127
And when he found out what I was doing,
he insisted on coming in.

97
00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:40.120
He put up half the cash.
He came of his own free will.

98
00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:47.437
If you're gonna kill me, will you
leave my face alone, for my mother?

99
00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:49.208
We just made your bail.

100
00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:52.712
Now if I wanted to kill you, I would have
left you in jail where we have friends.

101
00:11:52.813 --> 00:11:55.448
And in some way that I can only describe
as deeply pornographic,

102
00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:58.117
you would have been killed.
But you're a small piece of shit,

103
00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:03.519
and I don't want the karma of your death
on my soul.

104
00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:08.628
But on the other hand, maybe I don't
believe in karma, so, guys...

105
00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:10.630
No, no,
I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

106
00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:11.931
Okay, then this'll be quick.

107
00:12:12.032 --> 00:12:14.100
I wanna know one thing only.
Who brokered the deal?

108
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:15.968
His name is Otto Krieg.

109
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:19.839
And if it's any comfort to Mr. Saint,
he's dead, too.

110
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.407
Well, it's not.

111
00:12:21.508 --> 00:12:24.243
It's actually no comfort at all.

112
00:12:24.344 --> 00:12:26.345
But what might be comforting to me

113
00:12:26.446 --> 00:12:30.616
is to watch the slow death of the man who
was supposed to be taking care of my son

114
00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:33.486
and making sure
that he did not get into trouble.

115
00:12:33.587 --> 00:12:36.422
Now, Micky.

116
00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:39.058
What would your father think of this?

117
00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:43.295
Your father, who gave his life for me,
what would he say?

118
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.365
I didn't know it was gonna happen like this.
Please.

119
00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:51.758
Well, ignorance is no excuse.

120
00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:58.400
The man who's responsible
for my son's death must die.

121
00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:01.847
I told you to never let him out of your sight.

122
00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:05.351
Mr. Saint, Bobby told me to stay.

123
00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:09.547
Tell him, John. John!

124
00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:13.225
Mr. Saint, it was Bobby's idea.

125
00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:16.696
He wanted to go alone. He thought
he could impress you or something.

126
00:13:16.797 --> 00:13:20.961
Thank you for that explanation.

127
00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:27.470
My son didn't need to impress me.

128
00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:43.979
More boxes, guys.

129
00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:09.641
This was a hard one.

130
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.981
This was the last one.

131
00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:27.500
It's over.

132
00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:31.203
Tell that to your son.
He doesn't believe me.

133
00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:35.570
- Where is he?
- You know.

134
00:14:40.947 --> 00:14:45.651
You know what I miss most about Buck?
He could catch a ball.

135
00:14:45.752 --> 00:14:48.554
No matter how hard you threw it,

136
00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:50.356
he was right there.

137
00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:54.927
- Why are we always moving?
- This is the last time.

138
00:14:55.028 --> 00:14:57.663
You said that last time.

139
00:14:57.764 --> 00:15:00.790
I did?

140
00:15:01.167 --> 00:15:02.735
Yeah.

141
00:15:02.836 --> 00:15:05.738
You said we were leaving California

142
00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:10.843
and we were gonna move to Virginia,
and you'd work in Washington...

143
00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:14.647
and we'd never move again.

144
00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:17.850
I guess I've said a lot of things, huh?

145
00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:19.318
So why London?

146
00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:22.521
London's a safe place
where we can all be together.

147
00:15:22.622 --> 00:15:26.786
No more moving around, I promise.

148
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:31.891
Someday when you're older, Will...

149
00:15:31.998 --> 00:15:36.389
I'll tell you why we had to move so much.

150
00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:44.577
He was such a special boy.

151
00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:47.813
Mr. Saint, are you identifying this body
as your son, Robert Saint?

152
00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:50.616
He deserved better.

153
00:15:50.717 --> 00:15:52.585
Somebody lied to him.

154
00:15:52.686 --> 00:15:57.817
Promised him one thing, gave him another.

155
00:15:57.924 --> 00:16:01.393
Do you know that I used to have
to dress him till he was 13?

156
00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:06.298
I would tie his ties, comb his hair.

157
00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:10.597
I'll have to get him a new suit.

158
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:16.709
Who is Otto Krieg?

159
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.579
Who are the people who work for him?

160
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.581
Who are his friends?

161
00:16:22.682 --> 00:16:25.851
Who would stand to make money
from this deal? Tell me.

162
00:16:25.952 --> 00:16:28.120
We can't talk about the case, Mr. Saint.

163
00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:30.856
Now, I understand your grief,
but for your own safety,

164
00:16:30.957 --> 00:16:32.958
leave this to professionals.

165
00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:36.428
Professionals? Yes.

166
00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:39.862
I'll do that.

167
00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:44.100
I'll do that.

168
00:16:45.638 --> 00:16:49.005
Goodbye, Son.

169
00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.249
We called New York, we called Las Vegas,
we called Europe and Hong Kong,

170
00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.219
we even got the Sicilians in it
for old times' sake.

171
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.420
What about Weeks?

172
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:06.425
FBI Special Agent James Weeks,
age 37, former Green Beret.

173
00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:09.461
Recruited by the FBI eight years ago.

174
00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:12.865
Recently assigned
to the Bureau's Florida division.

175
00:17:12.966 --> 00:17:17.202
Divorced. Pays his taxes, avoids hookers.
No drug problems.

176
00:17:17.303 --> 00:17:18.837
One note of interest.

177
00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:22.408
He frequents an establishment in Ybor City
owned by two of our clients,

178
00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:23.676
the Toro brothers.

179
00:17:23.777 --> 00:17:24.843
He gambles?

180
00:17:24.944 --> 00:17:27.346
Roulette when he's up.
Blackjack when he's down.

181
00:17:27.447 --> 00:17:29.615
It sounds like fate to me.

182
00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:32.785
As far as Weeks is concerned,
a man who gambles has a history.

183
00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.286
I can guarantee you that.

184
00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:37.447
Let's go.

185
00:17:59.045 --> 00:18:02.281
Hoyo de Monterrey.

186
00:18:02.382 --> 00:18:03.615
The best.

187
00:18:03.716 --> 00:18:06.151
For 10 years, we've done business.

188
00:18:06.152 --> 00:18:11.050
Ten years you've handled our money and
this is the first time you come to my office.

189
00:18:11.057 --> 00:18:14.960
This is actually the first time you guys
have seen where the money comes from.

190
00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:17.596
You never invited me
to your house, Howard.

191
00:18:17.697 --> 00:18:21.000
And I know you're not a silver spooner
any more than me.

192
00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:25.196
So why not be social?

193
00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:28.340
My son is dead.

194
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:29.908
We didn't kill him.

195
00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:32.177
I didn't say you did.

196
00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.246
I can't bring him back, Howard.

197
00:18:34.347 --> 00:18:39.978
So, if you think I'm Jesus Christ,
you came to the wrong church.

198
00:18:55.602 --> 00:19:00.801
That man knows who killed my son.

199
00:19:08.281 --> 00:19:11.517
We can kill him right now, Howard,
if that's what you want.

200
00:19:11.618 --> 00:19:16.681
Just talk. Just talk to him, that's all.

201
00:19:23.263 --> 00:19:24.797
Good. Can I get in here?

202
00:19:24.898 --> 00:19:27.299
Let's go here.

203
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.335
Let's share that spot.

204
00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:35.737
Hey! That's it. We're good.

205
00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:44.416
You lay one hand on me,

206
00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:46.952
and 50 Federal agents will be here
in the morning with warrants.

207
00:19:46.953 --> 00:19:49.021
- No shit.
- No shit.

208
00:19:49.122 --> 00:19:50.389
Go get your warrants.

209
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.560
"Hey, your honor, we wanna bust
this illegal gambling joint,

210
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:58.586
"'cause I lost 200 grand."

211
00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:00.999
You'll be a meter maid before breakfast.

212
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.669
They'll suspend me for a month,
slap me on the wrist.

213
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.537
That's what you get the first time.

214
00:20:05.638 --> 00:20:08.874
What are you talking about?

215
00:20:08.975 --> 00:20:12.778
Clipped a couple of paychecks,
everything's hunky-dory, huh?

216
00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:18.647
But twice, not so hunky, not so dory.

217
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.996
Read the numbers, Joe.

218
00:20:31.097 --> 00:20:34.733
Jimmy Weeks. May 3, you lost 27 grand.

219
00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:37.703
May 17, 43.

220
00:20:37.804 --> 00:20:40.839
June 12, 134 grand.

221
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.810
You've already sold everything you own.
So how did you pay?

222
00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:49.803
Yeah. How did you pay?

223
00:20:50.216 --> 00:20:54.620
A friend of ours downtown works
in the Federal evidence locker,

224
00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:57.656
where all the seized cash and drugs go.

225
00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:01.293
This guy says there is 200 Gs missing.

226
00:21:01.394 --> 00:21:05.230
Wait a minute, Joe. This is a coincidence.

227
00:21:05.331 --> 00:21:10.257
Yeah, but wait. Aren't you
the supervising agent down there?

228
00:21:11.571 --> 00:21:13.872
I think you're going to jail.

229
00:21:13.973 --> 00:21:17.576
You don't get a wrist slap in jail,
Agent Weeks.

230
00:21:17.677 --> 00:21:20.976
You get a bitch slap.

231
00:21:27.253 --> 00:21:28.887
Sit down.

232
00:21:28.988 --> 00:21:33.254
If I wanted you killed,
it would have been done.

233
00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:37.362
I need you.

234
00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:41.767
A couple of nights ago,
I asked you about Otto Krieg.

235
00:21:41.868 --> 00:21:46.134
May I pose that question again?

236
00:21:46.572 --> 00:21:51.908
Now, I'm no fool.
So don't treat me like one.

237
00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:57.112
Otto Krieg.

238
00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:07.824
That's not his name.

239
00:22:15.935 --> 00:22:19.132
Fives.

240
00:22:20.873 --> 00:22:22.741
- Come on.
- That was cool.

241
00:22:22.842 --> 00:22:24.676
Leave it. We'll be back.

242
00:22:24.777 --> 00:22:26.378
- Race you?
- Yeah.

243
00:22:26.479 --> 00:22:28.046
Got anything left?

244
00:22:28.147 --> 00:22:32.017
I don't see it. Come on.

245
00:22:32.118 --> 00:22:34.953
He did his free ascent on the first try.

246
00:22:35.054 --> 00:22:36.755
I've seen Navy SEALs do worse.

247
00:22:36.756 --> 00:22:38.890
- All right, great, honey.
- That's what we like to hear.

248
00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:41.627
- I'm so proud of you.
- Good job, babe.

249
00:22:41.728 --> 00:22:44.730
Hey, Frank, is that that Candelaria?

250
00:22:44.831 --> 00:22:47.065
Yeah, Manuel.

251
00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:52.070
People around here call him a witch doctor.
He lives on that island way off the point.

252
00:22:52.171 --> 00:22:55.874
Only one damn fool I know
crazy enough to swim over there.

253
00:22:55.975 --> 00:22:59.502
Gee, let me guess.

254
00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:11.290
This is the first family reunion we've had
in five years.

255
00:23:11.391 --> 00:23:14.159
And that's too long. That's too long.

256
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.328
Amen.

257
00:23:16.429 --> 00:23:19.898
Two families that,
when you put them together, you get...

258
00:23:19.999 --> 00:23:24.459
You get this, my grandson!

259
00:23:26.873 --> 00:23:32.641
I just wanna say that
I'm very happy that you're all here.

260
00:23:32.779 --> 00:23:35.013
I'm very proud that you're all here.

261
00:23:35.114 --> 00:23:37.582
And that I love you.

262
00:23:37.683 --> 00:23:41.119
- We love you, too.
- Love you, too, Dad.

263
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.816
- <i>Salud.</i>
- <i>Salud!</i> Cheers!

264
00:24:10.082 --> 00:24:12.718
Hey.

265
00:24:12.819 --> 00:24:16.188
- Hey.
- What happened? What's wrong?

266
00:24:16.289 --> 00:24:19.891
I... You know...

267
00:24:19.992 --> 00:24:25.521
I can't believe I'm home.

268
00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:31.436
And that I could ever be so lucky.

269
00:24:31.537 --> 00:24:35.273
Because there were times, Maria,
I gotta tell you...

270
00:24:35.374 --> 00:24:38.468
Frank.

271
00:24:47.453 --> 00:24:50.355
I lost so much time, with both of you.

272
00:24:50.456 --> 00:24:53.558
- And I'm really sorry...
- Stop. Hey, hey, hey.

273
00:24:53.659 --> 00:24:57.996
I married you. I knew what I was doing.

274
00:24:58.097 --> 00:25:01.760
And I'd do it again.

275
00:25:02.068 --> 00:25:05.771
You and I, we're not lucky.

276
00:25:05.872 --> 00:25:09.364
We are blessed.

277
00:25:31.197 --> 00:25:34.792
I'll see you at home, Son.

278
00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:48.680
His name's Frank Castle.

279
00:25:48.781 --> 00:25:52.717
Senior agent.
Just got the Bureau's London desk.

280
00:25:52.818 --> 00:25:56.721
His alias, connections,
apartments in Europe,

281
00:25:56.822 --> 00:26:00.759
none of it was real, not even his death.

282
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:05.063
Well, maybe it was.
Maybe he died and came back to life

283
00:26:05.164 --> 00:26:09.225
so he could die again.

284
00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:11.803
You have your chance.

285
00:26:11.904 --> 00:26:18.104
He's leaving for England next week
and he's at a family reunion in Puerto Rico.

286
00:26:18.678 --> 00:26:20.111
I think you should be there,

287
00:26:20.212 --> 00:26:24.583
so you can come back
and tell Livia how he died.

288
00:26:24.684 --> 00:26:28.609
- All right.
- Wait.

289
00:26:33.893 --> 00:26:37.226
His family.

290
00:26:37.463 --> 00:26:40.955
His whole family.

291
00:26:42.335 --> 00:26:45.964
Is that what you want?

292
00:27:08.995 --> 00:27:12.556
- Morning.
- Hey.

293
00:27:12.765 --> 00:27:18.123
- We should have another.
- I'm ready.

294
00:27:19.205 --> 00:27:21.606
Another what?

295
00:27:21.707 --> 00:27:23.708
Morning, Will.

296
00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:27.040
Come here.

297
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:34.412
They were selling T-shirts in town.
One of them was really scary.

298
00:27:35.388 --> 00:27:38.590
The guy in the shop said
it wards off evil spirits.

299
00:27:38.691 --> 00:27:42.286
It's really intense.

300
00:27:42.662 --> 00:27:46.359
You know about this?

301
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.534
Let's see here...

302
00:27:53.472 --> 00:27:56.508
- This is interesting.
- Like it?

303
00:27:56.609 --> 00:27:59.411
Like it?

304
00:27:59.512 --> 00:28:05.007
I love it. Thanks.

305
00:28:35.915 --> 00:28:38.941
Thanks.

306
00:29:03.609 --> 00:29:06.277
- Here you go. Where's the camera? Okay.
- Come on, Mom. Come on.

307
00:29:06.378 --> 00:29:10.644
- Come on, Mom. You gotta see this.
- What?

308
00:29:38.677 --> 00:29:43.637
Your 1911 Colts.
You've done something to them.

309
00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:47.919
You could say that.

310
00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.989
I bored the chambers
and customized the triggers

311
00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.425
and added some compensators.

312
00:29:53.526 --> 00:29:56.461
They used to be pretty good,
but now they're nail drivers.

313
00:29:56.562 --> 00:29:58.096
Well, let's see.

314
00:29:58.197 --> 00:30:01.155
Hey, Mom.

315
00:30:01.634 --> 00:30:05.704
- Look.
- Wow. Look at that. It's a stingray.

316
00:30:05.805 --> 00:30:08.729
Yeah.

317
00:30:12.444 --> 00:30:16.014
- Mom?
- God, no, no!

318
00:30:16.115 --> 00:30:19.818
Get down, honey. Get down.

319
00:30:19.919 --> 00:30:25.118
Get over here.
Get under the boat. Get under it.

320
00:31:46.105 --> 00:31:49.131
Jesus.

321
00:31:57.616 --> 00:32:01.920
Okay, I'm gonna count to three, and we're
gonna run to the jeep. Okay, honey?

322
00:32:02.021 --> 00:32:06.583
- What about Dad?
- Dad'll be okay.

323
00:32:17.903 --> 00:32:22.931
One, two, three.

324
00:32:26.745 --> 00:32:29.080
Dad.

325
00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:32.480
Go, honey.

326
00:32:56.875 --> 00:33:00.208
You hang on, honey.

327
00:33:30.109 --> 00:33:33.237
Mom.

328
00:33:43.088 --> 00:33:46.182
You okay?

329
00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:05.870
Mom's gonna get help, okay?

330
00:34:25.364 --> 00:34:28.356
No!

331
00:34:48.554 --> 00:34:51.055
Come on, baby.

332
00:34:51.156 --> 00:34:53.891
- Get out of the car.
- Mom, my arm.

333
00:34:53.992 --> 00:34:56.060
Come on, honey, you can do it. Come on.

334
00:34:56.161 --> 00:34:59.163
- My arm. Mom, my arm.
- I know, baby.

335
00:34:59.264 --> 00:35:01.599
But we have to keep moving, okay?

336
00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.769
I need you to be a big boy,
and you have to keep moving, okay?

337
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:07.105
Okay.

338
00:35:07.206 --> 00:35:11.131
Help!

339
00:35:11.243 --> 00:35:14.012
Help!

340
00:35:14.113 --> 00:35:17.981
Somebody help me!

341
00:35:18.917 --> 00:35:21.219
Come on, baby!

342
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:26.656
Mom, here. Grandpa's boat.

343
00:35:34.399 --> 00:35:37.630
Run, honey!

344
00:36:00.025 --> 00:36:04.985
No. Maria!

345
00:38:07.753 --> 00:38:12.281
My mother and father send their regards.

346
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.297
This time they're not blanks.

347
00:38:19.398 --> 00:38:22.424
Maria...

348
00:39:56.061 --> 00:40:01.588
It's me, Castle. Candelaria.
I'll take care of you.

349
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.923
Palmer, you gonna make love to that car,
or are you gonna park it?

350
00:40:25.924 --> 00:40:28.459
Get that junk out of here!

351
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.594
Thank you.

352
00:40:30.695 --> 00:40:34.187
Come on, fellows.

353
00:40:39.738 --> 00:40:42.039
Big crowd tonight, Mr. Saint.

354
00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:46.941
- You look beautiful, Mrs. Saint.
- Little prick.

355
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:52.739
Holy shit.

356
00:41:02.394 --> 00:41:05.629
- To Bobby.
- To Bobby.

357
00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:09.495
To a score settled.

358
00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:23.608
Quentin, dance with Liv.

359
00:41:29.688 --> 00:41:33.090
- When did you speak to him?
- About an hour ago, Mr. Saint.

360
00:41:33.191 --> 00:41:37.355
He just said the Toros are starting...

361
00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:47.001
Try the Grand Turk.

362
00:42:09.294 --> 00:42:12.855
I got something for you.

363
00:42:18.436 --> 00:42:22.065
Harry Winston.

364
00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:27.878
Beautiful.

365
00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:32.313
Without you, they're just diamonds.

366
00:42:32.617 --> 00:42:37.748
I asked you to avenge our son,
and you did.

367
00:44:53.591 --> 00:44:56.788
Thank you.

368
00:44:58.763 --> 00:45:01.999
<i>Vaya con Dios</i>, Castle.

369
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.802
Go with God.

370
00:45:04.903 --> 00:45:08.964
God's gonna sit this one out.

371
00:47:00.785 --> 00:47:04.021
You are insignificant.

372
00:47:04.122 --> 00:47:07.291
You are a coward.

373
00:47:07.392 --> 00:47:13.456
You are a great disappointment
to your mother and I!

374
00:47:14.933 --> 00:47:17.968
Yes! Die! Die! Die!

375
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:24.269
I am the most amazing man in the world!

376
00:47:41.826 --> 00:47:45.462
It's really loud.
Is it supposed to be that loud?

377
00:47:45.563 --> 00:47:47.498
Oh, it's beautiful.

378
00:47:47.599 --> 00:47:49.600
He hasn't slept all week.

379
00:47:49.701 --> 00:47:53.103
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I haven't slept all week.

380
00:47:53.204 --> 00:47:56.006
What do you think he does?

381
00:47:56.107 --> 00:48:00.544
- Maybe he's an artist.
- Wow! Our neighbor is an artist.

382
00:48:00.645 --> 00:48:03.247
Yeah, and you're the expert on artists?

383
00:48:03.348 --> 00:48:05.449
I've known a few.

384
00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:07.885
So what do you think he's doing?

385
00:48:07.986 --> 00:48:10.120
Ask him.

386
00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:13.590
Oh, yeah, right. "Ask him."

387
00:48:13.691 --> 00:48:15.659
I'm late for work.

388
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.694
- Bye, Joan.
- Bye, Joan.

389
00:48:17.795 --> 00:48:20.719
Bye.

390
00:48:49.594 --> 00:48:53.223
This is undignified.

391
00:48:54.532 --> 00:48:58.491
You're supposed to be dead.

392
00:49:01.873 --> 00:49:04.241
Let's talk.

393
00:49:04.342 --> 00:49:07.144
Stay away from me, Castle.
I have friends, you know?

394
00:49:07.245 --> 00:49:09.246
Let's talk about your friends.

395
00:49:09.347 --> 00:49:12.182
Make your own friends, buddy.
I'm not saying nothing.

396
00:49:12.283 --> 00:49:16.253
I talk to you, they'll kill me.

397
00:49:16.354 --> 00:49:21.052
You don't help me, I'll kill you now, Mick.

398
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:25.596
The Saints tell me nothing.

399
00:49:25.697 --> 00:49:28.928
Nothing?

400
00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:35.733
They pay your rent...

401
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.435
your legal bills.

402
00:49:40.244 --> 00:49:44.135
You should know something.

403
00:49:47.118 --> 00:49:49.920
What's the torch for?

404
00:49:50.021 --> 00:49:56.551
2,000 degrees, Mick.
Enough to turn steel into butter.

405
00:50:00.498 --> 00:50:04.768
It won't hurt at first. It's too hot, you see?

406
00:50:04.869 --> 00:50:10.007
The flame sears the nerve endings shut,
killing them.

407
00:50:10.108 --> 00:50:14.912
You'll go into shock and all you'll feel is...

408
00:50:15.013 --> 00:50:18.039
cold.

409
00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:23.518
Isn't science fun, Micky?

410
00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:29.059
I don't know shit!

411
00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.229
You'll smell burning meat, and then...

412
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:34.431
Then it'll hurt.

413
00:50:34.532 --> 00:50:38.662
I swear I'm telling the truth!

414
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:46.465
Son of a bitch!

415
00:50:49.013 --> 00:50:51.248
Oh, my God.

416
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:53.150
Should we call the police?

417
00:50:53.251 --> 00:50:57.921
Let's stay out of it. He's a very scary man.

418
00:50:58.022 --> 00:51:02.159
- He's killing someone, and we're next.
- Exactly.

419
00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:06.560
No, no... Wait, wait...

420
00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:13.566
Smell that, Mick?
I'm burning off some of your fat.

421
00:51:17.942 --> 00:51:21.278
I'll tell you anything, anything,
anything you want to know.

422
00:51:21.379 --> 00:51:23.814
- That's a good boy.
- Okay, okay.

423
00:51:23.915 --> 00:51:27.617
Any discussion of Howard Saint's business
involves two Cubans,

424
00:51:27.718 --> 00:51:28.919
<i>the Toro brothers.</i>

425
00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:33.457
<i>They control all the prostitution</i>
<i>and gambling up and down the Gulf Coast.</i>

426
00:51:33.558 --> 00:51:34.958
<i>Tons of cash.</i>

427
00:51:35.059 --> 00:51:37.694
<i>They give their dirty money</i>
<i>to Howard Saint,</i>

428
00:51:37.795 --> 00:51:41.698
<i>who transports it in cigarette boats</i>
<i>to his banks in Grand Cayman,</i>

429
00:51:41.799 --> 00:51:46.827
<i>washes it and wires it back,</i>
<i>clean as a whistle.</i>

430
00:51:51.242 --> 00:51:55.007
For the love of God...

431
00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:15.565
You are not a nice person.

432
00:52:15.666 --> 00:52:19.269
So what's up, you're gonna string up
Howard Saint and blowtorch him?

433
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:22.239
I like that idea...

434
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.341
but I have something better.

435
00:52:24.442 --> 00:52:26.910
And guess what?

436
00:52:27.011 --> 00:52:28.345
You're gonna help me.

437
00:52:28.446 --> 00:52:31.548
Unless you wanna stay Howard Saint's
lackey for the rest of your life.

438
00:52:31.649 --> 00:52:34.317
I hate the Saints, all of them.

439
00:52:34.418 --> 00:52:39.389
Tell me about them.
What they do, where, when.

440
00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:41.491
Howard Saint's a man of strict habits.

441
00:52:41.592 --> 00:52:45.429
<i>He has first tee time five days a week</i>
<i>at Tampa Springs.</i>

442
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:47.831
<i>Never fails.</i>

443
00:52:47.932 --> 00:52:50.233
<i>He likes money, he likes power.</i>

444
00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:55.172
<i>But the thing this guy covets most?</i>
<i>The wife, Livia.</i>

445
00:52:55.273 --> 00:52:58.909
<i>What happened to your family,</i>
<i>Howard did that for her.</i>

446
00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:02.045
<i>She's just like him,</i>
<i>and she's just as predictable.</i>

447
00:53:02.146 --> 00:53:06.616
<i>Every Thursday she works out,</i>
<i>gets her nails done and goes to the movies.</i>

448
00:53:06.717 --> 00:53:09.286
<i>Howard knows</i>
<i>every move this broad makes.</i>

449
00:53:09.387 --> 00:53:14.654
<i>Any man who looks at her wrong,</i>
<i>he ends up in Tampa Bay.</i>

450
00:53:19.297 --> 00:53:23.266
<i>Let's not forget Johnny boy,</i>
<i>the son you didn't kill.</i>

451
00:53:23.367 --> 00:53:25.669
<i>What a putz.</i>

452
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:29.072
<i>Last but not least, Quentin Glass.</i>

453
00:53:29.173 --> 00:53:30.807
<i>Been with Howard 20 years.</i>

454
00:53:30.908 --> 00:53:34.244
<i>The family</i> consigliere, <i>lawyer, CPA,</i>

455
00:53:34.345 --> 00:53:36.113
<i>and a sadist.</i>

456
00:53:36.214 --> 00:53:40.639
<i>Who knows what's going on with this guy?</i>

457
00:54:09.213 --> 00:54:14.879
- Yes?
- <i>Pop, you're not gonna believe this.</i>

458
00:54:15.353 --> 00:54:18.982
Oh, I think I might.

459
00:54:20.091 --> 00:54:22.893
Chief Morris, will the budget cuts mean
less officers on the street?

460
00:54:22.994 --> 00:54:25.262
- How will this affect your ability...
- Thank you. No comment.

461
00:54:25.363 --> 00:54:29.266
What impact will all this have
on police layoffs?

462
00:54:29.367 --> 00:54:31.034
- Castle?
- Just a minute, the Frank Castle?

463
00:54:31.135 --> 00:54:32.836
Hey, I thought you were dead.

464
00:54:32.937 --> 00:54:37.101
Hold on. Hold on. Whoa, hold...

465
00:54:38.042 --> 00:54:40.343
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Jesus, Frank.

466
00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:42.279
Where have you been?

467
00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:48.185
I got shot. I woke up.
That's what I remember.

468
00:54:48.286 --> 00:54:51.221
You subpoena me, that's what I'll say.

469
00:54:51.322 --> 00:54:56.560
It's been five months since my family
was killed. I don't see one man in jail.

470
00:54:56.661 --> 00:54:58.461
Obviously you're upset.

471
00:54:58.562 --> 00:55:02.726
Upset? Is that the word?

472
00:55:03.768 --> 00:55:06.770
I used to get upset when I had a flat tire.

473
00:55:06.871 --> 00:55:09.139
I used to get upset
when a plane was delayed.

474
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:14.578
I used to get upset
when the Yankees won the Series.

475
00:55:14.679 --> 00:55:17.514
So if that's what "upset" means,

476
00:55:17.615 --> 00:55:20.217
then how do I feel now?

477
00:55:20.318 --> 00:55:23.653
If you know the word, tell me,
because I don't.

478
00:55:23.754 --> 00:55:27.190
Castle, if you're not gonna cooperate,
we're gonna have to...

479
00:55:27.291 --> 00:55:28.825
Wait, wait. This man has been through hell.

480
00:55:28.926 --> 00:55:31.761
Who's he supposed to trust right now?
Let's get him to a safe house.

481
00:55:31.862 --> 00:55:33.763
I don't want a safe house, Jimmy.

482
00:55:33.864 --> 00:55:38.927
I don't want Witness Protection.
I don't want anything.

483
00:55:40.037 --> 00:55:44.107
All I wanna know is who gave me up.

484
00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:46.209
Don't be a stranger, Jim.

485
00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:50.269
Castle, where have you been?

486
00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.678
Taxi!

487
00:57:07.158 --> 00:57:11.720
Get up. Wheel the money out.

488
00:57:20.271 --> 00:57:23.536
Fill that up.

489
00:57:26.844 --> 00:57:30.647
You know whose money this is?

490
00:57:30.748 --> 00:57:34.784
- You know whose building this is?
- Howard Saint's.

491
00:57:34.885 --> 00:57:37.420
He's gonna fuck your life up.

492
00:57:37.521 --> 00:57:41.358
He already fucked my life up.

493
00:57:41.459 --> 00:57:44.461
Now, out the window.

494
00:57:44.562 --> 00:57:47.520
What?

495
00:57:48.532 --> 00:57:51.922
Out the window.

496
00:58:33.644 --> 00:58:36.913
Good business, murder?

497
00:58:37.014 --> 00:58:43.146
Does Saint pay you for each one,
or does he get a group-rate discount?

498
00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:56.392
<i>Our top story this morning,</i>
<i>a double homicide in downtown Tampa.</i>

499
00:59:56.493 --> 00:59:58.695
<i>Two men were gunned down</i>
<i>in the lobby of the Saint Building...</i>

500
00:59:58.796 --> 01:00:00.463
<i>Now to our other breaking story...</i>

501
01:00:00.564 --> 01:00:03.132
<i>Francis Castle is alive and back in Tampa.</i>

502
01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:06.336
<i>You may remember,</i>
<i>Castle's the FBI agent presumed dead...</i>

503
01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:09.072
- <i>after his family's gangland killing.</i>
- He speaks six languages,

504
01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:13.601
he did two tours
with 12th Special Ops CTU.

505
01:00:13.702 --> 01:00:16.037
- What's CTU?
- Counter Terrorism Unit.

506
01:00:16.138 --> 01:00:19.040
<i>...at this hour. Right now,</i>
<i>Tampa police do not have a motive</i>

507
01:00:19.141 --> 01:00:20.474
<i>and no arrests have been made.</i>

508
01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:23.911
<i>That's the latest news at this hour.</i>
<i>We'll have more on this developing story...</i>

509
01:00:24.012 --> 01:00:27.174
It's him.

510
01:00:43.865 --> 01:00:47.096
Hi there.

511
01:01:03.985 --> 01:01:07.355
<i>I just wanna say that</i>
<i>I'm very happy that you're all here.</i>

512
01:01:07.456 --> 01:01:11.392
<i>I'm very proud that you're all here.</i>

513
01:01:11.493 --> 01:01:14.261
<i>I guess I've said a lot of things.</i>

514
01:01:14.362 --> 01:01:18.399
<i>We're not lucky. We are blessed.</i>

515
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:22.095
Maria!

516
01:01:28.443 --> 01:01:32.380
How is he still alive?
I don't know, Quentin. I wasn't there.

517
01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:36.450
Why is he still alive?
Now that, that's an interesting question.

518
01:01:36.551 --> 01:01:40.688
Maybe he's still alive because he was
meant to suffer more. I don't know.

519
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:45.920
But how can we make him suffer
if we can't find him?

520
01:01:46.895 --> 01:01:48.362
He's daring us.

521
01:01:48.463 --> 01:01:52.233
No, no.
He misses his family and he wants to die.

522
01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:56.725
He's asking for help, so let's help him.

523
01:02:00.442 --> 01:02:02.643
The Toros called?

524
01:02:02.744 --> 01:02:06.680
They'll be here tomorrow morning.

525
01:02:06.781 --> 01:02:09.350
You invited them to this house?

526
01:02:09.451 --> 01:02:13.649
They invited themselves, Howard.

527
01:02:13.822 --> 01:02:16.991
Mike, Joe. Welcome.

528
01:02:17.092 --> 01:02:20.027
- Let's get a drink.
- We don't have time for that, Howard.

529
01:02:20.128 --> 01:02:21.896
Oh, my God, this weather.

530
01:02:21.997 --> 01:02:24.098
Yeah, just a little polluted,
don't you think so?

531
01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:26.133
I've seen hurricanes.

532
01:02:26.234 --> 01:02:28.702
I've seen it rain like cats and dogs.

533
01:02:28.803 --> 01:02:31.806
But never in all my years
have I seen it rain $100 bills.

534
01:02:31.907 --> 01:02:35.776
Yeah, this rainmaker, Castle,
he was supposed to be dead, no?

535
01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:39.080
- Yeah.
- Guys, look.

536
01:02:39.181 --> 01:02:40.481
Come on.

537
01:02:40.582 --> 01:02:44.885
Working together for 10 years,
first time anything like this ever happened.

538
01:02:44.986 --> 01:02:48.689
At a personal loss to us
of $50 million, Howard,

539
01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:50.758
that's one time too many.

540
01:02:50.859 --> 01:02:54.061
Do you want us to find another banker?

541
01:02:54.162 --> 01:02:55.930
No.

542
01:02:56.031 --> 01:02:57.598
Okay.

543
01:02:57.699 --> 01:03:00.734
Look, we want our money back, all right?

544
01:03:00.835 --> 01:03:03.104
And we want protection
on the next shipment.

545
01:03:03.205 --> 01:03:06.173
Do you guarantee our money this time?

546
01:03:06.274 --> 01:03:09.869
With everything I've got.

547
01:03:16.151 --> 01:03:22.112
In 48 hours, Castle's a memory.
A pro from Memphis. The best.

548
01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:28.294
You know, I spoke at your funeral.

549
01:03:28.863 --> 01:03:32.287
What did you say?

550
01:03:33.201 --> 01:03:35.803
I said it was hard to imagine you dead.

550
01:03:35.904 --> 01:03:38.906
Anything you can imagine, Jimmy,

550
01:03:39.007 --> 01:03:42.643
there's always something worse.

550
01:03:42.744 --> 01:03:45.646
You called to tell me that?

550
01:03:45.747 --> 01:03:50.885
Frank, I need you to get out of town.

551
01:03:50.986 --> 01:03:52.319
Let me handle this.

552
01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:55.289
Let me find out who set you up
before they find you.

553
01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:57.224
I'm hoping they find me.

554
01:03:57.325 --> 01:03:59.093
You're not thinking straight.

555
01:03:59.194 --> 01:04:02.823
You're gonna end up a dead man.

556
01:04:03.098 --> 01:04:06.829
I'm already dead.

557
01:04:16.444 --> 01:04:19.580
So, listen, guy. Take care.

558
01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:22.049
Think about what I said.

559
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:25.786
What happened to your Porsche, Jimmy?
You used to love that car.

560
01:04:25.887 --> 01:04:30.984
Hey, man.
Patriotic, I wanted to buy American.

561
01:04:45.206 --> 01:04:46.607
Come on, Joanie.

562
01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:51.679
Open up the goddamn door, or I'll kill you.
I'm fucking freezing, bitch!

563
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.881
You're hurting my feelings.

564
01:04:53.982 --> 01:04:58.619
I wanna talk with you now, honey.
You're hurting my feelings.

565
01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:04.258
Joanie, open up the goddamn door!
You're hurting my feelings, you bitch!

566
01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:07.027
Dude?

567
01:05:07.128 --> 01:05:08.762
It's kind of late.

568
01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:11.565
Yeah? What time is it in Hawaii?

569
01:05:11.666 --> 01:05:13.334
You should leave right now.

570
01:05:13.435 --> 01:05:17.667
Shut your face, you lardass.

571
01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:20.441
Joanie, come on, baby, let me in.

572
01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:24.103
I'm gonna call the cops.

573
01:05:31.786 --> 01:05:33.554
Are you?

574
01:05:33.655 --> 01:05:36.156
You'll call the cops?
You wanna call the cops?

575
01:05:36.257 --> 01:05:39.393
Call them, call them, call them!

576
01:05:39.494 --> 01:05:43.631
- Call them, call them, call them!
- Hey.

577
01:05:43.732 --> 01:05:46.860
Get out.

578
01:05:47.369 --> 01:05:49.136
What, what, what?

579
01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:52.506
Mikey don't have his tricks anymore?

580
01:05:52.607 --> 01:05:55.242
And the speed? Huh?

581
01:05:55.343 --> 01:05:58.676
What, what, what...

582
01:06:03.451 --> 01:06:07.319
You shouldn't play with knives.

583
01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:22.100
No one's ever stood up for me before.

584
01:06:29.644 --> 01:06:32.112
Come on, champ.
Let's get some ice on that.

585
01:06:32.213 --> 01:06:36.517
Come on. Frank kicked his ass, huh?

586
01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:40.577
He's fine. He's all right.

587
01:06:42.524 --> 01:06:45.448
I...

588
01:06:46.327 --> 01:06:50.664
I've lived in seven cities in seven years,

589
01:06:50.765 --> 01:06:56.670
and in each one, I've managed to find
the one guy who will treat me the worst.

590
01:06:56.771 --> 01:07:00.207
But I'm trying to fix that.

591
01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:03.675
You're Castle.

592
01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:06.213
Used to be.

593
01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:08.349
We saw you on TV.

594
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:11.452
I don't have one.

595
01:07:11.553 --> 01:07:13.287
I'm Joan.

596
01:07:13.388 --> 01:07:17.458
Dave's the one with all the metal.

597
01:07:17.559 --> 01:07:20.260
And Bumpo's the...

598
01:07:20.361 --> 01:07:25.389
Well, you can probably figure out
which one Bumpo is.

599
01:07:26.067 --> 01:07:29.336
We're really sorry.

600
01:07:29.437 --> 01:07:31.605
About what?

601
01:07:31.706 --> 01:07:35.233
About your family.

602
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:38.712
Did you know them?

603
01:07:38.813 --> 01:07:41.702
No.

604
01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:45.949
I'm over it.

605
01:07:56.431 --> 01:08:00.390
Don't let your memories kill you.

606
01:08:04.639 --> 01:08:07.938
They won't kill me.

607
01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:19.112
- Glass.
- Quentin Glass?

608
01:09:19.213 --> 01:09:20.214
Who is this?

609
01:09:20.315 --> 01:09:23.984
<i>I have certain photographic studies</i>
<i>of you and your boyfriend.</i>

610
01:09:24.085 --> 01:09:25.953
<i>Meet me at the bar at the Wyndham Hotel.</i>

611
01:09:26.054 --> 01:09:29.990
<i>Bring $5,000, and I'll give you the photos.</i>

612
01:09:30.091 --> 01:09:35.188
<i>You wouldn't want Howard Saint</i>
<i>to see them, Mr. Glass.</i>

613
01:10:37.725 --> 01:10:41.718
Thank you, sir. Have a good night.

614
01:10:46.267 --> 01:10:48.101
Quentin's late. Do you know where he is?

615
01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:50.137
I have no idea.

616
01:10:50.238 --> 01:10:51.738
Have you seen your mother?

617
01:10:51.839 --> 01:10:55.042
It's Thursday, Pop.

618
01:10:55.143 --> 01:10:57.311
Right. Movies.

619
01:10:57.412 --> 01:11:00.614
Mr. Saint? I know where Mr. Glass is.

620
01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:06.051
I saw him pulling into the Wyndham Hotel
a couple of hours ago.

621
01:11:08.823 --> 01:11:14.159
That was good. I never...

622
01:11:17.598 --> 01:11:19.232
Howard? Come here.

623
01:11:19.333 --> 01:11:21.835
I was just telling Quentin about the movie.

624
01:11:21.936 --> 01:11:24.171
Where have you been, Quentin?

625
01:11:24.272 --> 01:11:26.306
I've been looking for you.

626
01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.075
I dozed off out by the pool.

627
01:11:28.176 --> 01:11:29.509
That's funny.

628
01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:30.711
What's funny?

629
01:11:30.812 --> 01:11:32.879
Micky said that he saw you
at the Wyndham.

630
01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:35.115
Micky should have his eyes checked.

631
01:11:35.216 --> 01:11:37.050
So he's mistaken?

632
01:11:37.151 --> 01:11:40.916
Yes, Howard, he's mistaken.

633
01:11:46.994 --> 01:11:52.261
Oh, my goodness.
These pancakes are really good, Joan.

634
01:11:54.268 --> 01:11:57.738
What's he been doing for the last few days?

635
01:11:57.839 --> 01:11:59.906
Drinking.

636
01:12:00.007 --> 01:12:03.033
A lot.

637
01:12:08.983 --> 01:12:13.317
Good morning, sir. Sit anywhere you like.

638
01:13:02.537 --> 01:13:06.840
<i>I can hear what you're thinking</i>

639
01:13:06.941 --> 01:13:11.244
<i>All your doubts and fears</i>

640
01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:13.380
<i>And if you look in my eye</i>

641
01:13:13.481 --> 01:13:19.519
<i>In time you'll find the reason I'm here</i>

642
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:23.757
<i>And in time all things shall pass away</i>

643
01:13:23.858 --> 01:13:30.092
<i>In time you may come back someday</i>

644
01:13:30.464 --> 01:13:34.127
<i>To live once more</i>

645
01:13:34.468 --> 01:13:38.700
<i>Or die once more</i>

646
01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:47.170
<i>But in time your time will be no more</i>

647
01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:11.037
- Do I know you?
- I know you.

648
01:14:11.138 --> 01:14:15.408
You're that boy in the newspaper.
Came back from the dead.

649
01:14:15.509 --> 01:14:19.104
I didn't catch your name.

650
01:14:25.353 --> 01:14:27.788
You like that song?

651
01:14:27.889 --> 01:14:31.552
I wrote that for you.

652
01:14:36.998 --> 01:14:41.298
I'm gonna sing it at your funeral.

653
01:16:13.561 --> 01:16:16.463
You are one dumb son of a bitch,

654
01:16:16.564 --> 01:16:20.728
bringing a knife to a gunfight.
  
655
01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:54.801
Frank, what are you doing here?

656
01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:57.437
I've come to a conclusion.

657
01:16:57.538 --> 01:17:01.942
If I wanna find peace,
I'm not gonna find it in Tampa.

658
01:17:02.043 --> 01:17:03.710
So I'm going.

659
01:17:03.811 --> 01:17:06.846
- Where?
- I don't know.

660
01:17:06.947 --> 01:17:10.250
Come on, man. You can tell me.

661
01:17:10.351 --> 01:17:15.652
- I'll send you a post card.
- Cool.

662
01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:29.002
Listen, I got to run.
You going somewhere, you need a ride?

663
01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.938
No.

664
01:17:32.039 --> 01:17:34.341
I'm gonna go smoke some cigarettes.

665
01:17:34.442 --> 01:17:38.071
You don't smoke.

666
01:17:45.486 --> 01:17:50.719
Come on, let's move. Let's move!

667
01:18:47.882 --> 01:18:51.384
All of it? All?

668
01:18:51.485 --> 01:18:53.453
Look at this, Joe.

669
01:18:53.554 --> 01:18:59.390
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Don't fucking touch me, <i>cojones</i>.

170
01:18:59.727 --> 01:19:01.828
Don't tell the Toros till we have a plan.

671
01:19:01.929 --> 01:19:04.464
Look at this place. Isn't it beautiful?

672
01:19:04.565 --> 01:19:08.101
Howard,
we had chicken <i>a la Havana</i> tonight.

673
01:19:08.202 --> 01:19:10.236
Very tasty.
 
674
01:19:10.337 --> 01:19:13.864
Don't touch the Cubans.

675
01:19:18.445 --> 01:19:19.913
Have you heard the news?

676
01:19:20.014 --> 01:19:23.516
A shipment of cash was torched
on Mullet Key.

677
01:19:23.617 --> 01:19:25.552
Whose money was it, huh?

678
01:19:25.653 --> 01:19:28.788
Our mother always put her cash
in the mattress,

679
01:19:28.889 --> 01:19:30.924
which I thought it was a good idea.

680
01:19:31.025 --> 01:19:33.259
Till the house burned down.

681
01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:38.298
It was a big fire. She lost everything.

682
01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:42.368
That's what happens
when you don't watch your money.

683
01:19:42.469 --> 01:19:44.871
You lose everything, Howard. Everything.

684
01:19:44.972 --> 01:19:47.574
Fourteen shipments are perfect.

685
01:19:47.675 --> 01:19:51.611
One went bad and I get this.
Why? Because you want to scare me?

686
01:19:51.712 --> 01:19:54.781
There's no insurance in this business,
you know that.

687
01:19:54.882 --> 01:19:57.450
So I'm not covering your fucking losses.

688
01:19:57.551 --> 01:20:00.787
And, Mike, if you don't like it,
just remember one thing.

689
01:20:00.888 --> 01:20:05.052
I've got more guns than you do.

690
01:20:06.193 --> 01:20:08.928
It's not even Cuban, Howard.

691
01:20:09.029 --> 01:20:12.396
It's Honduran.

692
01:20:15.569 --> 01:20:18.204
They're animals.

693
01:20:18.305 --> 01:20:20.507
With all due respect,
we don't have more guns.

694
01:20:20.608 --> 01:20:24.043
- It's my duty to...
- It's your duty to make Castle dead!

695
01:20:24.144 --> 01:20:26.846
I don't care what it takes, what it costs.

696
01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:29.836
Call The Russian.

697
01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:53.037
Here. Now we both have one, Frank.

698
01:21:13.494 --> 01:21:16.296
Hi.

699
01:21:16.397 --> 01:21:18.665
Mr. Castle, we need your help right now,

700
01:21:18.766 --> 01:21:25.330
because the guy who's after Joan
is in her apartment right now.
 
701
01:21:48.162 --> 01:21:52.189
We want you to have dinner with us.

702
01:22:18.025 --> 01:22:20.026
I know it's not Thanksgiving,

703
01:22:20.127 --> 01:22:26.225
but I'd like us to all say
what we're thankful for.

704
01:22:27.134 --> 01:22:30.365
I'll start.

705
01:22:32.473 --> 01:22:36.500
I'm thankful to be alive this year.

706
01:22:36.777 --> 01:22:40.304
And to have a job.

707
01:22:40.848 --> 01:22:44.306
And to be sober.

708
01:22:45.052 --> 01:22:50.423
Yeah, I'm thankful
for my mom getting out of jail.

709
01:22:50.524 --> 01:22:54.627
You know, it's cool.

710
01:22:54.728 --> 01:22:58.798
And this girl gave me her number,

711
01:22:58.899 --> 01:23:02.494
which is also cool.

712
01:23:02.803 --> 01:23:06.072
Thanks for leftovers. I'm full.

713
01:23:06.173 --> 01:23:08.207
Thanks for Diet Pepsi.

714
01:23:08.308 --> 01:23:12.108
And thanks for good neighbors.

715
01:23:21.655 --> 01:23:25.113
Thanks for dinner.

716
01:23:27.194 --> 01:23:29.395
There's dessert.

717
01:23:29.496 --> 01:23:32.632
Ice Florentine.

718
01:23:32.733 --> 01:23:36.602
You have to try my Ice Florentine.
Come on, Dave.

719
01:23:36.703 --> 01:23:40.833
Come on. I need your help.

720
01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:56.981
No, no. I'll do that.

721
01:24:18.946 --> 01:24:22.677
I know what it's like.

722
01:24:25.252 --> 01:24:30.679
I know what it's like
to try and make your memories go away.

723
01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:41.801
You can make new memories.

724
01:24:41.902 --> 01:24:45.099
Good ones.

725
01:24:49.343 --> 01:24:53.575
Good memories can save your life.

726
01:25:08.862 --> 01:25:13.026
I'm not what you're looking for.

727
01:28:21.188 --> 01:28:24.453
Did you feel that?

728
01:29:00.594 --> 01:29:04.325
No, no, no.

729
01:30:55.775 --> 01:30:57.843
Mr. Castle?

730
01:30:57.944 --> 01:31:00.936
Frank?

731
01:31:01.481 --> 01:31:04.609
I'm fine.

732
01:31:05.986 --> 01:31:09.114
He's not.

733
01:31:18.899 --> 01:31:21.433
- We've gotta get him to a hospital.
- He needs a doctor.

734
01:31:21.534 --> 01:31:24.904
- You need a doctor.
- No hospital, no police.

735
01:31:25.005 --> 01:31:29.738
- Okay, all right. All right.
- I know what he wants.

736
01:31:57.170 --> 01:32:00.503
Okay. Okay.

737
01:32:02.108 --> 01:32:05.066
Jesus.

738
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:20.259
Well, it sure looks like
you know what you're doing, Joan.

739
01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:23.562
I don't know much,
but I'm good with a needle.

740
01:32:23.663 --> 01:32:28.464
Don't ask. This will hurt.

741
01:32:31.371 --> 01:32:33.539
He looks weak.

742
01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.973
Is he gonna die?

743
01:32:37.277 --> 01:32:39.812
Appearances aren't everything.

744
01:32:39.913 --> 01:32:43.542
You can let go now.

745
01:32:58.064 --> 01:33:01.166
- We have to move him.
- Where? There's no place to go.

746
01:33:01.267 --> 01:33:04.395
What do we do?

747
01:33:09.309 --> 01:33:12.301
Elevator.

748
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:25.491
Nice.

749
01:33:25.592 --> 01:33:29.426
Okay, come on. Let's go.

750
01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:34.257
Careful.

751
01:34:13.073 --> 01:34:15.374
Where's Castle?

752
01:34:15.475 --> 01:34:20.435
Frank Castle, who lives here.

753
01:34:21.047 --> 01:34:23.749
I asked you a question, fat man.

754
01:34:23.850 --> 01:34:25.617
Leave him alone.

755
01:34:25.718 --> 01:34:27.920
Then I'll ask you.

756
01:34:28.021 --> 01:34:31.411
Where's Castle?

757
01:34:31.958 --> 01:34:34.360
He's not here.

758
01:34:34.461 --> 01:34:36.662
Really?

759
01:34:36.763 --> 01:34:40.096
Are you sure?

760
01:34:45.105 --> 01:34:47.639
What did you say?

761
01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:50.142
I'm having a difficult time hearing you.

762
01:34:50.243 --> 01:34:53.112
I said...

763
01:34:53.213 --> 01:34:54.880
I'm not saying shit.

764
01:34:54.981 --> 01:34:59.952
Well, I don't want you to say shit,
I want you to answer me.

765
01:35:00.053 --> 01:35:05.286
You don't wanna say anything
about anything you might know?

766
01:35:42.128 --> 01:35:44.730
Maybe we should get to know each other
a little better.

767
01:35:44.831 --> 01:35:47.733
What's your name?

768
01:35:47.834 --> 01:35:49.301
Dave.

769
01:35:49.402 --> 01:35:52.471
You go to school around here?

770
01:35:52.572 --> 01:35:56.675
- You don't go to school?
- No.

771
01:35:56.776 --> 01:35:58.277
No, I dropped out.

772
01:35:58.378 --> 01:36:01.836
You dropped out?

773
01:36:01.981 --> 01:36:04.149
You're not doing drugs, are you?

774
01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:07.319
Not right now.

775
01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:10.756
And what are you doing with all this stuff?
What is that?

776
01:36:10.857 --> 01:36:12.391
Piercings.

777
01:36:12.492 --> 01:36:16.895
Piercings? Did it hurt when you do that?

778
01:36:16.996 --> 01:36:18.263
Little bit.

779
01:36:18.364 --> 01:36:20.432
You like that?

780
01:36:20.533 --> 01:36:25.402
- When it hurt a little bit?
- No.

781
01:36:26.573 --> 01:36:31.043
That's a special one there, isn't it?
Is that your favorite?

782
01:36:31.144 --> 01:36:35.239
- That's hard to get.
- Yeah.

783
01:36:54.734 --> 01:36:58.397
Answer my question, please.

784
01:36:59.405 --> 01:37:02.294
No.

785
01:37:08.081 --> 01:37:10.883
- Come here. Come here.
- No.

786
01:37:10.984 --> 01:37:14.215
What's the matter?

787
01:37:18.891 --> 01:37:24.557
Your friend's about to have a bad day.
You can save him by talking.

788
01:37:29.435 --> 01:37:33.303
It doesn't have to be this way.

789
01:37:33.706 --> 01:37:36.942
You think you know about pain, boy?

790
01:37:37.043 --> 01:37:41.002
You think you know about pain?

791
01:37:46.619 --> 01:37:49.054
That's okay. That's okay.

792
01:37:49.155 --> 01:37:51.490
Are you gonna tell me?

793
01:37:51.591 --> 01:37:54.826
Dave? Little Dave?

794
01:37:54.927 --> 01:37:57.663
- Are you gonna tell me?
- No!

795
01:37:57.764 --> 01:38:01.700
Okay, why don't you and I just see
if we can discover the true nature of pain?

796
01:38:01.801 --> 01:38:02.834
Stop.

797
01:38:02.935 --> 01:38:04.336
Come here, Dave.

798
01:38:04.437 --> 01:38:06.371
Come on. Dave, come on.

799
01:38:06.472 --> 01:38:08.207
- You wanna talk to me?
- No!

800
01:38:08.308 --> 01:38:11.610
You can talk to me.

801
01:38:11.711 --> 01:38:15.272
- Talk to me, Dave.
- No!

802
01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:28.227
If they knew, they would have talked.

803
01:38:28.328 --> 01:38:31.263
They must not have known.

804
01:38:31.364 --> 01:38:35.033
If... When he shows up,

805
01:38:35.134 --> 01:38:38.262
kill him.

806
01:38:44.844 --> 01:38:49.907
- Go ahead.
- <i>Castle's alive. The Russian's dead.</i>

807
01:38:50.483 --> 01:38:53.752
- Where's Quentin?
- <i>Home. I'm at the office.</i>

808
01:38:53.853 --> 01:38:57.389
Close the club. Get everyone in.

809
01:38:57.490 --> 01:39:00.492
We're going hunting.

810
01:39:00.593 --> 01:39:03.962
I'll be back after 10:00.

811
01:39:04.063 --> 01:39:08.932
Darling? It's Thursday.

812
01:39:10.236 --> 01:39:13.569
Bye, sweetie.

813
01:40:31.651 --> 01:40:35.246
Look what they did to him.

814
01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:41.849
They tried to make me talk.

815
01:40:42.028 --> 01:40:45.759
I gave them nothing.

816
01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:50.936
You don't know me.

817
01:40:51.037 --> 01:40:55.273
You don't owe me anything.
I've brought you nothing but trouble.

818
01:40:55.374 --> 01:40:57.642
Why are you ready to die for me?

819
01:40:57.743 --> 01:41:02.476
'Cause you're one of us.

820
01:41:02.982 --> 01:41:06.349
You're family.

821
01:41:18.164 --> 01:41:21.622
Get him to a hospital.

822
01:41:22.335 --> 01:41:26.795
Come on, champ,
they'll get you all fixed up.

823
01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:56.735
Say you kill them all.

824
01:41:56.836 --> 01:42:02.297
Then what?
What makes you any different from them?

825
01:42:04.043 --> 01:42:07.740
They have something to lose.

826
01:42:13.653 --> 01:42:17.851
You're gonna die tonight, aren't you?

827
01:42:19.025 --> 01:42:22.449
Is that what you want?

828
01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:39.444
<i>I leave this as a declaration of intent,</i>
<i>so no one will be confused.</i>

829
01:42:39.545 --> 01:42:42.914
<i>One,</i>"Si vis pacem, para bellum."

830
01:42:43.015 --> 01:42:44.115
<i>Latin.</i>

831
01:42:44.216 --> 01:42:47.519
<i>The boot camp sergeant made us</i>
<i>recite it like a prayer.</i>

832
01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.721
"Si vis pacem, para bellum."

833
01:42:49.822 --> 01:42:55.283
<i>"If you want peace, prepare for war."</i>

834
01:43:31.197 --> 01:43:32.163
Glass.

835
01:43:32.264 --> 01:43:34.599
<i>Quentin, those pictures of you,</i>
<i>I changed my mind.</i>

836
01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:36.601
<i>The number's now $10,000.</i>

837
01:43:36.702 --> 01:43:39.437
<i>Be at McNab's,</i>
<i>the men's store on Broadway, at 9:00 p.m.,</i>

838
01:43:39.538 --> 01:43:40.939
<i>or they'll have their own website.</i>

839
01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:44.309
- Listen to me, you son of...
- <i>Remember, 9:00 p.m.</i>

840
01:43:44.410 --> 01:43:47.868
<i>Just do it, Glass.</i>

841
01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:12.498
- Duka speaking.
- You're on.

842
01:44:20.279 --> 01:44:23.882
Mr. Saint,
how do you want me to pay for this?

843
01:44:23.983 --> 01:44:24.983
Pay for what?

844
01:44:25.084 --> 01:44:28.687
I was detailing Mrs. Saint's car
and I found this ticket.

845
01:44:28.788 --> 01:44:31.389
Just take care of it. Where was it?

846
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:33.925
The Wyndham Hotel.

847
01:44:34.026 --> 01:44:36.661
- What's that date?
- September 5.

848
01:44:36.762 --> 01:44:39.798
Last Thursday.

849
01:44:39.899 --> 01:44:42.167
Where did you say Quentin was
last Thursday?

850
01:44:42.268 --> 01:44:43.635
The Wyndham Hotel.

851
01:44:43.736 --> 01:44:48.773
But Mrs. Saint was at the movies
last Thursday. I mean, wasn't she?

852
01:44:48.874 --> 01:44:52.010
- Do you have a key for Quentin's house?
- Sure.

853
01:44:52.111 --> 01:44:55.478
I do his laundry.

854
01:44:56.182 --> 01:44:58.149
Micky?

855
01:44:58.250 --> 01:45:01.753
Get me last month's phone bill.

856
01:45:01.854 --> 01:45:04.812
Yes, sir.

857
01:45:43.095 --> 01:45:47.156
Need help with some underpants, sir?

858
01:45:48.434 --> 01:45:51.767
Go fuck yourself.

859
01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:43.388
Evening, Quentin.

860
01:46:43.489 --> 01:46:45.757
Howard.

861
01:46:45.858 --> 01:46:49.627
- What are you doing here?
- Jim Bowie.

862
01:46:49.728 --> 01:46:51.029
Excuse me?

863
01:46:51.130 --> 01:46:54.466
You know, Jim Bowie, the colonel,

864
01:46:54.567 --> 01:46:56.835
the man who died in the Alamo.

865
01:46:56.936 --> 01:46:59.938
Had a knife named after him.
He was a gambler.

866
01:47:00.039 --> 01:47:01.806
And when he was accused
of cheating at cards,

867
01:47:01.907 --> 01:47:05.677
what he would do is,
he would take the guy in the other room,

868
01:47:05.778 --> 01:47:09.514
move the furniture like so.

869
01:47:09.615 --> 01:47:12.350
Then he'd take his knife.

870
01:47:12.451 --> 01:47:15.620
He'd throw it in the ground.

871
01:47:15.721 --> 01:47:18.923
And the one that left

872
01:47:19.024 --> 01:47:20.492
got the money.

873
01:47:20.593 --> 01:47:21.793
Gee, I didn't know that, Howard.

874
01:47:21.894 --> 01:47:26.164
The only problem is
that you have too much furniture.

875
01:47:26.265 --> 01:47:27.565
I'm not following this.

876
01:47:27.666 --> 01:47:32.103
- I'm accusing you.
- Of what?

877
01:47:32.204 --> 01:47:34.272
Cheating.

878
01:47:34.373 --> 01:47:38.366
I've never taken a cent from you.

879
01:47:39.812 --> 01:47:42.614
Where were the two of you
gonna do it next time, the Wyndham?

880
01:47:42.715 --> 01:47:45.617
- Two who?
- You and the whore.

881
01:47:45.718 --> 01:47:49.984
I don't know what you're talking about.

882
01:47:52.157 --> 01:47:55.627
You're good.
You should have been a stage actor.

883
01:47:55.728 --> 01:47:57.929
Maybe next lifetime.

884
01:47:58.030 --> 01:48:00.632
What are you doing?

885
01:48:00.733 --> 01:48:04.435
You better pick up the knife, Quentin,
'cause if you don't, I will.

886
01:48:04.536 --> 01:48:08.666
I don't need to grab a knife, Howard.

887
01:48:09.041 --> 01:48:12.636
This isn't funny, Howard.

888
01:48:14.246 --> 01:48:16.681
What...

889
01:48:16.782 --> 01:48:18.483
What...

890
01:48:18.584 --> 01:48:23.121
How long have you worked for me?
Do you think I'm an idiot?

891
01:48:23.222 --> 01:48:26.783
Have you lost your mind...

892
01:48:28.661 --> 01:48:32.363
You were my brother.
I gave you everything, denied you nothing.

893
01:48:32.464 --> 01:48:34.465
But it wasn't enough.

894
01:48:34.566 --> 01:48:36.201
My Liv.

895
01:48:36.302 --> 01:48:39.470
What has she told you?

896
01:48:39.571 --> 01:48:42.707
Don't do this... Don't...

897
01:48:42.808 --> 01:48:44.042
Don't do this!

898
01:48:44.143 --> 01:48:48.313
Don't, don't, don't do this. Howard!

899
01:48:48.414 --> 01:48:51.883
Howard, Howard, you're killing me.

900
01:48:51.984 --> 01:48:54.752
You're killing me. Why?

901
01:48:54.853 --> 01:48:59.483
Why are you killing me?
Why are you killing me?

902
01:49:43.202 --> 01:49:44.936
How was work?

903
01:49:45.037 --> 01:49:47.605
Why is that gun pointed at me?

904
01:49:47.706 --> 01:49:51.540
It's how I say hi to everyone these days.

905
01:49:52.578 --> 01:49:55.613
What did happen to your Porsche, Jimmy?

906
01:49:55.714 --> 01:49:59.050
I told you, "buy American."

907
01:49:59.151 --> 01:50:01.586
I didn't see your fishing boat outside.

908
01:50:01.687 --> 01:50:04.656
Well, you know what they say
about owning boats.

909
01:50:04.757 --> 01:50:07.592
The two happiest days are the day
you buy it and the day you sell it.

910
01:50:07.693 --> 01:50:11.763
They say that about TVs and stereos?

911
01:50:11.864 --> 01:50:15.857
Wristwatches?

912
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:20.338
I had my money in hi-tech stocks.

913
01:50:20.439 --> 01:50:23.074
Broker kept telling me,
"Don't sell. Don't sell."

914
01:50:23.175 --> 01:50:28.146
I'm an old soldier. I follow orders.
And now I'm broke. Get off my back.

915
01:50:28.247 --> 01:50:31.883
Okay, Jimmy.

916
01:50:31.984 --> 01:50:35.249
I get it.

917
01:50:46.331 --> 01:50:50.358
Why did you call me the other day, Jimmy?

918
01:50:51.136 --> 01:50:55.869
Why didn't you run
when you saw that I was still alive?

919
01:50:56.375 --> 01:51:00.611
- How long have you known?
- You mean for certain?

920
01:51:00.712 --> 01:51:04.876
Enough to, say, bet on?

921
01:51:05.250 --> 01:51:08.419
Not till now.

922
01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:13.878
- I'm sorry, Frank.
- Me, too.

923
01:51:24.636 --> 01:51:27.271
I'm not a betting man, Jimmy.

924
01:51:27.372 --> 01:51:29.574
- I'll tell you who did it.
- You did it.

925
01:51:29.675 --> 01:51:33.511
- Saint did it!
- No, you did it.

926
01:51:33.612 --> 01:51:36.547
You called the other day 'cause you're sick.

927
01:51:36.648 --> 01:51:39.450
You need my help.

928
01:51:39.551 --> 01:51:43.254
That's what friends are for, right?

929
01:51:43.355 --> 01:51:47.086
Well, here I am.

930
01:51:48.994 --> 01:51:52.828
I'm here to help.

931
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:10.145
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm not gonna do anything.

932
01:52:11.250 --> 01:52:14.378
You are.

933
01:52:19.091 --> 01:52:22.060
Frank, I...

934
01:52:22.161 --> 01:52:28.623
Let's say goodbye like the friends
we were, huh? Not like animals.

935
01:52:43.215 --> 01:52:49.814
- I can't do it.
- You can and you will.

936
01:52:50.589 --> 01:52:54.787
- You do it.
- No.

937
01:53:58.123 --> 01:54:00.424
What the hell are you doing?

938
01:54:00.525 --> 01:54:02.793
I know about you and Quentin.

939
01:54:02.894 --> 01:54:04.428
Quentin?

940
01:54:04.529 --> 01:54:07.732
You went to the movies
last Thursday, 8:00?

941
01:54:07.833 --> 01:54:08.833
Yes.

942
01:54:08.934 --> 01:54:11.469
Then at 9:00 you called him from your car?

943
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:13.704
Must have been a short movie.

944
01:54:13.805 --> 01:54:15.973
Howard, there's an explanation.

945
01:54:16.074 --> 01:54:18.509
Oh, I know.

946
01:54:18.610 --> 01:54:21.112
You're fucking him.

947
01:54:21.213 --> 01:54:23.181
You're fucking my best friend.

948
01:54:23.282 --> 01:54:25.950
That would be
a little hard to accomplish, Howard.

949
01:54:26.051 --> 01:54:29.253
Oh, so true.

950
01:54:29.354 --> 01:54:32.812
So true.

951
01:54:35.761 --> 01:54:36.794
Howard.

952
01:54:36.895 --> 01:54:41.662
You should really learn
to pay your parking tickets.

953
01:54:42.768 --> 01:54:44.802
I don't know what...

954
01:54:44.903 --> 01:54:47.538
You thought we...

955
01:54:47.639 --> 01:54:50.608
Howard, Quentin was gay.

956
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:54.474
You'd say anything!

957
01:54:55.681 --> 01:54:59.417
I don't know what happened.
Would you just talk to me?

958
01:54:59.518 --> 01:55:03.886
Howard, Howard.

959
01:55:20.505 --> 01:55:22.373
Howard.

960
01:55:22.474 --> 01:55:24.609
You have to listen to me.

961
01:55:24.710 --> 01:55:26.377
Please, Howard.

962
01:55:26.478 --> 01:55:28.412
Please, Howard.

963
01:55:28.513 --> 01:55:31.449
Do you recognize the neighborhood?

964
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:34.118
Little Cuba?

965
01:55:34.219 --> 01:55:35.753
Just think,

966
01:55:35.854 --> 01:55:38.923
the first time I saw you
was only three blocks from here.

967
01:55:39.024 --> 01:55:40.958
Look at me, Howard.

968
01:55:41.059 --> 01:55:45.630
Of course, then the neighborhood was
so much more colorful.

969
01:55:45.731 --> 01:55:48.566
Look at me. Howard, please.

970
01:55:48.667 --> 01:55:49.867
Please, Howard.

971
01:55:49.968 --> 01:55:54.530
Now it's just for whores. You'll fit right in.

972
01:56:07.619 --> 01:56:10.254
Look at that rock! Look at it! Take a look!

973
01:56:10.355 --> 01:56:14.058
I gave you that when I had nothing.
And all I asked for in return was loyalty.

974
01:56:14.159 --> 01:56:17.161
I have been loyal to you, Howard.
You're not making any sense!

975
01:56:17.262 --> 01:56:19.864
I'm not making sense? Here, look at this.

976
01:56:19.965 --> 01:56:25.494
I found that in Quentin's bed.
Does that make enough sense for you?

977
01:56:25.771 --> 01:56:29.366
- No. No.
- No?

978
01:56:30.642 --> 01:56:33.873
Me neither.

979
01:56:56.168 --> 01:56:58.569
I'd like to go to the club.

980
01:56:58.670 --> 01:57:02.197
I need a martini.

981
01:57:18.590 --> 01:57:21.058
$50,000 apiece.

982
01:57:21.159 --> 01:57:24.495
And $50,000 more to the man who kills him.

983
01:57:24.596 --> 01:57:29.988
If you accept this money,
you're in till it's over.

984
01:57:36.374 --> 01:57:39.741
Where have you been?

985
01:57:41.179 --> 01:57:44.148
- Where's Quentin?
- Oh, well,

986
01:57:44.249 --> 01:57:46.884
he's wrapped up in something.

987
01:57:46.985 --> 01:57:52.022
- I called home, no one was there.
- Your mother's gone.

988
01:57:52.123 --> 01:57:56.514
- What?
- She took the train.

989
01:58:01.933 --> 01:58:06.670
<i>Number two, Frank Castle is dead.</i>

990
01:58:06.771 --> 01:58:10.605
<i>He died with his family.</i>

991
01:58:11.443 --> 01:58:13.043
<i>Number three,</i>

992
01:58:13.144 --> 01:58:16.847
<i>in certain extreme situations,</i>

993
01:58:16.948 --> 01:58:20.084
<i>the law is inadequate.</i>

994
01:58:20.185 --> 01:58:26.357
<i>In order to shame its inadequacy,</i>
<i>it is necessary to act outside the law,</i>

995
01:58:26.458 --> 01:58:30.895
<i>to pursue natural justice.</i>

996
01:58:30.996 --> 01:58:33.230
<i>This is not vengeance.</i>

997
01:58:33.331 --> 01:58:37.968
<i>Revenge is not a valid motive,</i>
<i>it's an emotional response.</i>

998
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:41.994
<i>No, not vengeance.</i>

999
01:58:42.173 --> 01:58:45.597
<i>Punishment.</i>

1000
02:00:03.121 --> 02:00:07.387
Hey, Eddie,
more champagne on the double.

1001
02:00:09.995 --> 02:00:13.226
Coming right up.

1002
02:02:34.339 --> 02:02:37.467
Stop!

1003
02:03:23.621 --> 02:03:26.890
You look like a strong kid.
You must work out.

1004
02:03:26.991 --> 02:03:29.093
Ever try isometrics?

1005
02:03:29.194 --> 02:03:32.129
This antipersonnel mine weighs
eight pounds.

1006
02:03:32.230 --> 02:03:34.565
Not much.

1007
02:03:34.666 --> 02:03:40.127
But try holding it with an outstretched arm.

1008
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:48.937
Hell of a workout.

1009
02:03:51.749 --> 02:03:53.684
Don't leave me like this.

1010
02:03:53.785 --> 02:03:56.520
Don't leave me like this!

1011
02:03:56.621 --> 02:04:00.921
Help, please.

1012
02:04:05.096 --> 02:04:08.398
Howard Saint.

1013
02:04:08.499 --> 02:04:12.424
Howard Saint!

1014
02:04:13.905 --> 02:04:17.602
You took everything from me.

1015
02:04:20.545 --> 02:04:22.346
You killed my son.

1016
02:04:22.447 --> 02:04:25.507
No!

1017
02:04:26.985 --> 02:04:30.318
Both of them.

1018
02:05:05.823 --> 02:05:09.782
I made you kill your best friend.

1019
02:05:13.598 --> 02:05:17.193
I made you kill your wife.

1020
02:05:17.802 --> 02:05:20.637
Oh, God.

1021
02:05:20.738 --> 02:05:24.401
And now I've killed you.

1022
02:08:52.083 --> 02:08:56.954
You're right.
Good memories can save your life.

1023
02:08:57.055 --> 02:08:59.690
When Dave gets out of the hospital,
check the cupboard.

1024
02:08:59.791 --> 02:09:03.527
I left something. For all of you.

1025
02:09:03.628 --> 02:09:05.362
You're leaving.

1026
02:09:05.463 --> 02:09:08.955
I have work to do.

1027
02:09:09.434 --> 02:09:13.537
Read your newspaper every day.
You'll understand.

1028
02:09:13.638 --> 02:09:16.607
Which section?

1029
02:09:16.708 --> 02:09:19.939
Obituaries.

1030
02:10:35.587 --> 02:10:39.790
<i>Those who do evil to others,</i>
<i>the killers, the rapists,</i>

1031
02:10:39.891 --> 02:10:42.393
<i>psychos, sadists,</i>

1032
02:10:42.494 --> 02:10:45.062
<i>you will come to know me well.</i>

1033
02:10:45.163 --> 02:10:48.198
<i>Frank Castle is dead.</i>

1034
02:10:48.299 --> 02:10:51.201
<i>Call me</i>

1035
02:10:51.302 --> 02:10:54.635
<i>The Punisher.</i>
