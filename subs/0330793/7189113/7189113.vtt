the Mr. Universe of

199
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:23.110
international arms dealers?

200
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.040
Micky, you should

201
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.040
apologize for the death

202
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.880
of Mr. Saint's

203
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.880
youngest child.

204
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.030
Ok, I know

205
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.030
how it looks.

206
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.450
But Bobby,

207
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.450
he buys pot from me.

208
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.870
And--and when he found out

209
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.870
what I was doing,

210
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.870
he insisted on coming in.

211
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.970
He put up half the cash.

212
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.970
He came of his own free will.

213
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.260
If you're gonna

214
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.260
kill me,

215
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.260
will you leave my face alone,

216
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.260
for my mother?

217
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.250
We just made your bail.

218
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.500
Now if I wanted

219
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.500
to kill you,

220
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.440
I would have left you in jail

221
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.440
where we have friends.

222
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.170
And in some way

223
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.170
that I can only describe

224
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.170
as deeply pornographic,

225
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.930
you would have been killed.

226
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.930
But you're

227
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.930
a small piece of shit,

228
00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.380
and I don't want

229
00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.380
the karma of your death

230
00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.380
on my soul.

231
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.350
But on the other hand,

232
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.350
maybe I don't believe

233
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.350
in karma, so, guys...

234
00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.320
No, no,

235
00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.320
I'll tell you anything

236
00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.320
you wanna know.

237
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.690
Ok, then this'll be quick.

238
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.690
I wanna know

239
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.690
one thing only.

240
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.830
Who brokered the deal?

241
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.680
His name is Otto Krieg.

242
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.670
And if it's

243
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.670
any comfort to Mr. Saint,

244
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.670
he's dead, too.

245
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.150
Well, it's not.

246
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.990
It's actually

247
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.990
no comfort at all.

248
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.070
But what might be

249
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.070
comforting to me

250
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.940
is to watch

251
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.940
the slow death of the man

252
00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.490
who was supposed to be

253
00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.490
taking care of my son

254
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.300
and making sure

255
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.300
that he did not

256
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.300
get into trouble.

257
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.010
Now, Micky.

258
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.780
What would your father

259
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.780
think of this?

260
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.040
Your father,

261
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.040
who gave his life for me,

262
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.040
what would he say?

263
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.040
I didn't know

264
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.040
it was gonna happen

265
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.040
like this. Please.

266
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.600
Well,

267
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.600
ignorance is no excuse.

268
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.100
The man who's responsible

269
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.100
for my son's death must die.

271
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.770
HOWARD:

272
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.770
I told you to never let him

273
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.770
out of your sight.

274
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.080
Mr. Saint,

275
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.080
Bobby told me to stay.

276
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.510
Tell him, John. John!

277
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.970
Mr. Saint,

278
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.970
it was Bobby's idea.

279
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.370
He wanted to go alone.

280
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.470
He thought he could impress

281
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.470
you or something.

282
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.360
Thank you for

283
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.360
that explanation.

284
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.310
My son didn't need

285
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.310
to impress me.

286
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.960
More boxes, guys.

287
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:07.470
This was a hard one.

288
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.680
This was the last one.

It's over.

292
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.940
Tell that to your son.

293
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.950
He doesn't believe me.

294
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.380
Where is he?

295
00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.580
You know.

296
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.640
You know what I miss most

297
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.640
about Buck?

298
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.440
He could catch a ball.

299
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.560
No matter how hard

300
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.560
you threw it,

301
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.220
he was right there.

302
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.130
WILL:

303
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.130
Why are we always moving?

304
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.650
This is the last time.

305
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.690
You said that last time.

306
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.640
I did?

307
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.480
Yeah.

308
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.460
You said we were

309
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.460
leaving California

310
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.720
and we were gonna

311
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.720
move to Virginia,

312
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.700
and you'd work

313
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.700
in Washington

314
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.690
and we'd never move again.

315
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.790
I guess I’ve said

316
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.790
a lot of things, huh?

317
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.040
So why London?

318
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.260
London's a safe place

319
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.260
where we can all be together.

320
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.720
No more moving around,

321
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.720
I promise.

322
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.810
Someday when you're older,

323
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.810
Will,

324
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.360
I'll tell you

325
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.360
why we had to move

326
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.360
so much.

327
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.300
He was such a special boy.

328
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.560
Mr. Saint,

329
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.560
are you identifying this body

330
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.560
as your son, Robert Saint?

331
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.360
He deserved better.

332
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.330
Somebody lied to him.

333
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.660
Promised him one thing,

334
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.660
gave him another.

335
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.140
Do you know that

336
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.140
I used to have to dress him

337
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.140
till he was 13?

338
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.920
I would tie his ties,

339
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.920
comb his hair.

340
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.440
I'll have to get him

341
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.440
a new suit.

342
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.440
Who is Otto Krieg?

343
00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.040
Who are the people

344
00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.040
who work for him?

345
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.310
Who are his friends?

346
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.610
Who would stand to make

347
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.610
money from this deal?

348
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.610
Tell me.

349
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.950
We can't talk

350
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.950
about the case,

351
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.950
Mr. Saint.

352
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.600
Now, I understand your grief,

353
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.600
but for your own safety,

354
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.700
leave this to professionals.

355
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.940
Professionals? Yes.

356
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.690
I'll do that.

357
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.930
I'll do that.

358
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.930
Goodbye, son.

359
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.520
QUENTIN:

360
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.520
We called New York,

361
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.520
we called Las Vegas,

362
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.030
we called Europe

363
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.030
and Hong Kong,

364
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.830
we even got

365
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.830
the Sicilians in on it

366
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.830
for old times' sake.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.830

Recently assigned

Florida division.

377
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.210
Divorced. Pays his taxes,

avoids hookers.

379
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.950
No drug problems.

380
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.880
One note of interest.

381
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.150
He frequents

382
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.150
an establishment in Ybor City

383
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.150
owned by two of our clients,

the Toro brothers.

385
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.820
He gambles?

386
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:27.090
Roulette when he's up.

387
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:27.090
Blackjack when he's down.

388
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.360
It sounds like fate to me.

389
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.860
As far as

390
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.860
Weeks is concerned,

391
00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.530
a man who gambles

392
00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.530
