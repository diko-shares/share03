<i>Let them help you.</i>

{\an8}<i>Chores around the house?</i>

4
00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:25.458
{\an8}<i>There isn't anything
they can't do.</i>

5
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.917
{\an8}<i>The next marvelous advancement</i>

6
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.458
<i>in robotics
is artificial intelligence.</i>

7
00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:37.333
<i>By studying the human brain,</i>

8
00:01:37.417 --> 00:01:39.208
<i>we have given
independent thought</i>

9
00:01:39.292 --> 00:01:40.750
{\an8}<i>and life to robots,</i>

10
00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:44.000
{\an8}<i>allowing them to join
the American workforce</i>

11
00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:45.875
<i>almost like real people.</i>

12
00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:50.542
<i>Now, a new technology</i>

13
00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:52.917
<i>is bridging the gap
between humans and A.I.,</i>

14
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.333
<i>making us closer than ever.</i>

15
00:01:54.417 --> 00:01:56.958
<i>By scanning
your own facial features,</i>

16
00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:59.292
<i>we can give them
to a fully robotic body,</i>

17
00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:01.875
<i>making them
more human than human.</i>

18
00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958
{\an8}<i>With a simulant, the future's
never looked better.</i>

19
00:02:06.917 --> 00:02:08.000
<i>A.I. is integrated</i>

20
00:02:08.083 --> 00:02:10.542
<i>into all parts
of our day-to-day life.</i>

21
00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:11.958
<i>They cook our meals,</i>

22
00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:13.667
<i>they drive our cars,</i>

23
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.458
<i>they are our civil servants,</i>

24
00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:16.542
<i>keeping the peace,</i>

25
00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:18.250

<i>defense system, they even...</i>

27
00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:40.708
<i>Ten years ago today,
a nuclear warhead</i>

28
00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:42.458
<i>was detonated in Los Angeles.</i>

29
00:02:43.708 --> 00:02:46.625
<i>Nearly a million people
incinerated,</i>

30
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.083
<i>in the blink of an eye</i>

31
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.333
<i>by the artificial intelligence
created to protect us.</i>

32
00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:55.417
<i>We banned A.I.
in the Western World,</i>

33
00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.375
<i>so this will never happen again.</i>

34
00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:02.583
<i>Yet the republics of New Asia</i>

35
00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:06.667
<i>do not share our concern,
and continue to develop A.I...</i>

36
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.792
<i>embracing them as equals.</i>

37
00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:10.625
<i>Now, make no mistake.</i>

38
00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:13.375
<i>We're not at war
with the people of New Asia.</i>

39
00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:15.042
<i>But the A.I. they harbor...</i>

40
00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:20.167
<i>This is a fight
for our very existence.</i>

41
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.542
<i>For as long as A.I. is a threat,</i>

42
00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:26.167
<i>we will never stop hunting them.</i>

43
00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:01.125

<i>And let me play among the stars</i>

53
00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:42.042
Baby girl.

54
00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:44.625
Well, they're
either gonna be really smart,

55
00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:47.250
- or take after their dad.
- Whoo!

56
00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:49.292
- She mad at you.
- That was...

57
00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:51.417
That was a kick of agreement.

58
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.976
- That was a kick of agreement?
- Yes...

59
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.708
- That was... Yeah.
- She's like "Nah,"

60
00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:56.000
"nah, don't call Daddy that."

61
00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:57.542
"Don't say that to Daddy."

62
00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:59.059
Wait. I mean, you are
a hundred percent sure

63
00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:00.333
I'm the dad, right?

64
00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:04.667
No.

65
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.375
- Try to understand.
- Oh, wow.

66
00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:08.708
When it's born,
if it starts acting like

67
00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:10.917
a complete dick,
you can feel pretty confident.

68
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.480
- Oh, man!
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

69
00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:13.851
- No, that is... You know what?
- I'm kidding.

70
00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:14.934
I'm good. I think I'm leaving.

71
00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.309
- No, no, I don't want...
- I'm kidding. I'm sorry.

72
00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:17.934
- No, I just... I feel hurt.
- I'm kidding.

73
00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.708
- Now I feel insecure...
- Shush.

74
00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:21.552
And I don't know
if I can carry on this...

75
00:05:22.292 --> 00:05:24.333
<i>In other words</i>

76
00:05:24.417 --> 00:05:26.417
<i>I love you</i>

77
00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:14.542
What's going on?

78
00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:18.792
We found an American.

79
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.917
Who told you our location?

80
00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:29.208
- Harun.
- Oh, please.

81
00:06:29.292 --> 00:06:33.125
Brother, they found us.
We weren't careful enough.

82
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.958
Shit, <i>Nomad's
</i>coming this way. Let's go.

83
00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:42.208
Let's go!

84
00:06:42.292 --> 00:06:43.625
Get the boats. Hurry!

85
00:06:45.292 --> 00:06:46.417
Americans are coming.

86
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.625
American...

87
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.208
Go, go, go!
To the boats.

88
00:06:50.417 --> 00:06:51.917
- Joshua.
- Oh, please.

89
00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:57.000
Maya, he's seen us.

90
00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:00.292
We can take him
with us. A hostage.

91
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.208
- Please.
- Get your things.

92
00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:08.917
Please. Don't do it.

93
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.542
Please.

94
00:07:12.542 --> 00:07:14.059
Drew, what the hell
are you doing here?

95
00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:15.583
You're gonna blow my cover.

96
00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:17.333
You were gonna
give me more time.

97
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.083
Orders. Kill Nirmata.

98
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.917
Nirmata's not here.

99
00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:23.333
You hear me?
Nirmata's not here

100
00:07:23.417 --> 00:07:24.792
<i>Engaging the enemy.</i>

101
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.167
Into the house. Now!

102
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.792
- Move!
- Go, go, go!

103
00:07:36.917 --> 00:07:39.750
This is Sergeant Taylor.
Call off the raid, damn it!

104
00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:40.875
Nirmata's not here.

105
00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.042
<i>Moving in on Nirmata!</i>

106
00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:43.500
- <i>Near the guest room.
- </i>Listen,

107
00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:45.303
I'm undercover.
You gotta call off the raid.

108
00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:57.625
Told me you were out.
You promised.

109
00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:02.583
Trust me, they don't want you.
They just want Nirmata.

110
00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:06.500
So let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

111
00:08:11.542 --> 00:08:12.542
Maya.

112
00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:14.833
Easy.

113
00:08:15.667 --> 00:08:16.667
I love you.

114
00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:20.042
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

115
00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:22.083
Hell...

116
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.792
you're all I have.

117
00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:27.917
Please. We have to go.

118
00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:29.458
What about the others?

119
00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.125
What do you mean?

120
00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:33.707
- They're my family.
- They're not people, Maya.

121
00:08:35.292 --> 00:08:36.582
They're not real!

122
00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:38.375
This is real!
You and I are real.

123
00:08:38.457 --> 00:08:40.917
This love is real.
That child is real!

124
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.582
No.

125
00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:46.167
This...

126
00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.792
this isn't real.

127
00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.333
Maya, you don't
mean that. Please.

128
00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:54.184
- Sergeant Taylor!
- Maya, please!

129
00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:55.750
- No!
- Hey, let's go!

130
00:08:56.292 --> 00:08:57.375
Come on.
Hey, let's go!

131
00:08:57.458 --> 00:08:59.208

<i>- Shit! Oh, my God!</i>

179
00:12:20.875 --> 00:12:22.417
Where is the child I was with?

180
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.643
- Where is she?
<i>- Will you help me?</i>

181
00:12:23.667 --> 00:12:25.643
- Child! Where is she?
<i>- Get it off me! Get it off me!</i>

182
00:12:25.667 --> 00:12:27.333
She needs my assistance!

183
00:12:27.417 --> 00:12:28.577
<i>- Foreman!
</i>- -Her name is Amy!

184
00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:29.726
<i>- We got a 11-4-4.
</i>- Is she okay?

185
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.750
- Yeah...
- Child!

186
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:31.875
<i>- Hey!
- Amy!</i>

187
00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.208
Amy! No, no, no! Please,

188
00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:36.250
- please, please don't. Don't.
<i>- Wait, no.</i>

189
00:12:36.333 --> 00:12:38.250
Amy!

190
00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:40.000
<i>- Foreman, you got that?
- Yeah.</i>

191
00:12:40.083 --> 00:12:41.667
<i>Copy that, Taylor.
He's offline now.</i>

192
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.125
<i>That was like
a real person, okay?</i>

193
00:12:43.208 --> 00:12:44.476
<i>- Hey, calm down, Harrison.
- That was like a real...</i>

194
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.851
<i>- Harrison, Harrison.
- That was like a real person!</i>

195
00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:47.333
<i>- Harrison!
- Dude, what the hell?</i>

196
00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:48.458
<i>That was real!</i>

197
00:12:48.542 --> 00:12:49.708
<i>They're not real, okay?</i>

198
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.875
<i>They don't feel shit.</i>

199
00:12:54.167 --> 00:12:55.333
<i>Just programming.</i>

200
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.333
<i>Prepare level two</i>

201
00:13:01.417 --> 00:13:02.625
<i>for thermal processing.</i>

202
00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:07.833
<i>Seven-five,
begin recycling process.</i>

203
00:13:18.458 --> 00:13:20.875
{\an8}<i>Fifteen years
since the nuclear explosion</i>

204
00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:21.958
{\an8}<i>in Los Angeles</i>

205
00:13:22.042 --> 00:13:25.458
{\an8}<i>launched the West
into a war to eradicate A.I.</i>

206
00:13:25.583 --> 00:13:27.750
{\an8}<i>The trillion-dollar
military station,</i> Nomad,

207
00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:30.458
{\an8}<i>is finally helping

208
00:13:30.542 --> 00:13:32.917
{\an8}<i>Becoming a permanent fixture
over the battlefields</i>

209
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.375
{\an8}<i>of New Asia, where A.I.</i>

210
00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:36.500
<i>is making its last stand.</i>

211
00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:39.292
<i>Acknowledging the pain,
and sorrow</i>

212
00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:40.875
<i>- that has taken place.
- Hello!</i>

213
00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.101
- <i>Hello!
- Children who have lost</i>

214
00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:43.375
<i>- everything...
- Hey!</i>

215
00:13:44.292 --> 00:13:45.375
I remember this.

216
00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:49.792
<i>Hello! Hey! Hello!</i>

217
00:13:50.542 --> 00:13:51.942
<i>Looks like you've
seen some trouble.</i>

218
00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:56.042
How'd you get these?

219
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.250
L.A. nuke.

220
00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:01.083
You lost people?

221
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.625
Yeah, I lost my parents.

222
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.917
My mom and dad, my brother.

223
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.333
Sorry.

224
00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:15.000
They were at Ground Zero.
It was instantaneous.

225
00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:17.042
So, it's all good.

226
00:14:17.167 --> 00:14:18.250
Okay. Squeeze my hand.

227
00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.125
Can let go now.

228
00:14:24.708 --> 00:14:27.958
What, my hand? Okay.

229
00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:31.500
And a one. And a...
No, it's stuck.

230
00:14:32.792 --> 00:14:33.912
But let's try another angle.

231
00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:36.500
If I try another angle...

232
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.625
Sergeant Taylor...

233
00:15:13.833 --> 00:15:15.750
I'm General Andrews.
This is Colonel Howell.

234
00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:17.792
No.

235
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:20.958
No what, son?

236
00:15:21.042 --> 00:15:22.625
Whatever it is you want.

237
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.500
People come here every week.
Ask me if I remember.

238
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.083
I don't. I don't remember.

239
00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.438
You're gonna wanna
see this, Sergeant.

240
00:15:41.708 --> 00:15:44.000
We've located Nirmata's lab.

241
00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:46.292
It's in the area
where you were undercover.

242
00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:47.875
Our intelligence tells us

243
00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.000
that Nirmata's developed
a super weapon

244
00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:51.458
called Alpha-O.

245
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.292
It's designed to destroy <i>Nomad.</i>

246
00:15:56.292 --> 00:15:58.375
Well, I'm sorry
for your loss, I guess.

247
00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:02.375
You know,
Neanderthal's got a bad rap.

248
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.333
I mean, people talk
about them like

249
00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:06.500
they were dumb, but...

250
00:16:06.583 --> 00:16:08.250
you know,
turns out they made tools.

251
00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:10.667
They made clothes.
They made medicine

252
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.625
out of plants.
They even made art.

253
00:16:12.708 --> 00:16:15.000
Little flower necklaces
to bury their dead in.

254
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.167
The only problem was
there was a species

255
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.750
that was smarter
and meaner than them.

256
00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:21.917
Us.

257
00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:24.208
And we raped and murdered them

258
00:16:24.292 --> 00:16:25.292
out of existence.

259
00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.417
You get where
I'm going here, Taylor?

260
00:16:29.292 --> 00:16:32.375
It took nearly a decade
to build <i>Nomad,</i>

261
00:16:32.542 --> 00:16:34.875
so this our last chance
at winning the war.

262
00:16:36.208 --> 00:16:38.208
If they get this
Alpha-O weapon online

263
00:16:38.292 --> 00:16:40.958
and destroy <i>Nomad, </i>they win.

264
00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:43.208
And we go extinct.

265
00:16:44.917 --> 00:16:47.083
You're the only one who knows
the layout of that lab.

266
00:16:48.167 --> 00:16:49.667
Maybe you can help us.

267
00:16:58.417 --> 00:17:01.500
Did they tell you how close
I was to finding Nirmata?

268
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.125
How close I was
to killing the son of a bitch?

269
00:17:04.208 --> 00:17:06.083
How you assholes screwed
the whole mission

270
00:17:06.166 --> 00:17:07.958
with <i>Nomad's</i> missile strike?

271
00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:09.434
- Sergeant...
- 'Cause that much I remember.

272
00:17:09.458 --> 00:17:12.250
I lost my wife that night,
General, all due respect.

273
00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:15.333
I lost someone
very near and dear to me.

274
00:17:18.833 --> 00:17:20.375
I lost a child that night.

275
00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:25.458
So, I don't give a shit
about becoming extinct.

276
00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:30.750
I got TV to watch.

277
00:17:42.917 --> 00:17:43.917
<i>Hey.</i>

278
00:17:49.083 --> 00:17:50.167
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

279
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.750
<i>We're not far from the beach,
so we should just stop here.</i>

280
00:17:54.292 --> 00:17:56.333
<i>- Deal me in.
- Maya?</i>

281
00:17:58.708 --> 00:17:59.958
This can't be real.

282
00:18:01.292 --> 00:18:03.667
This was recorded two days ago.

283
00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.292
Authentication tests confirm
she's human.

284
00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:09.500
Do you recognize this location?

285
00:18:10.875 --> 00:18:11.875
Sergeant Taylor...

286
00:18:13.458 --> 00:18:15.583
- Joshua.
<i>- Come on. Let's...</i>

287
00:18:15.667 --> 00:18:17.958
My orders
are to destroy that weapon

288
00:18:18.042 --> 00:18:19.500
and the facility,

289
00:18:19.583 --> 00:18:21.375
and whoever's there
is going to be killed,

290
00:18:21.458 --> 00:18:25.083
but if you can remember
enough to come with us,

291
00:18:25.208 --> 00:18:27.875
guide my team, I promise you,

292
00:18:28.042 --> 00:18:29.417
we will bring that woman back.

293
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.667
<i>Come on, let's...</i>

294
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.958
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

295
00:18:33.042 --> 00:18:34.458
Move out at 0600.

296
00:18:49.708 --> 00:18:51.750
All right, settle down.

297
00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:54.125
Welcome back to New Asia.

298
00:18:54.208 --> 00:18:55.833
We've got
a location on the lab...

299
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.667
which, as you can see,

300
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.875
is way behind enemy lines.

301
00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:03.708
Our nearest base,
400 miles away.

302
00:19:03.833 --> 00:19:05.917
They don't care about LA here.

303
00:19:06.458 --> 00:19:08.167
The human locals,
including the police,

304
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.667
all work with A.I.

305
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.708
Robots, humans, and simulants,
they all hate us.

306
00:19:13.458 --> 00:19:14.542
So, you get caught,

307
00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:16.417
you're screwed.

308
00:19:17.333 --> 00:19:18.333
Don't get caught.

309
00:19:19.333 --> 00:19:21.542
Sergeant Taylor knows
the layout of the facility.

310
00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:23.667
We work off him.

311
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.000
Our mission is to find

312
00:19:25.083 --> 00:19:27.125
the weapon designated Alpha-O.

313
00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.750
Then we call in a missile strike

314
00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:30.792
from <i>Nomad</i> and blow it up.

315
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.583
Yeah.

316
00:19:32.667 --> 00:19:33.708
Dismissed.

317
00:19:33.792 --> 00:19:35.042
Hey, I got dibs.

318
00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:36.375
That's pretty ballin', man!

319
00:19:38.292 --> 00:19:39.833
As long as I kill it after.

320
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.333
- That's your wife?
- Mmm-hmm.

321
00:19:49.917 --> 00:19:51.750
I'd do anything
for just one more minute.

322
00:19:53.875 --> 00:19:55.000
It's fine. It's fine.

323
00:19:55.083 --> 00:19:56.333
I know, I got you.

324
00:19:56.417 --> 00:19:57.500
I lost...

325
00:19:57.583 --> 00:20:00.333
I lost both my sons in this war.

326
00:20:00.417 --> 00:20:02.257
This is the real...
This is the cream of the...

327
00:20:02.417 --> 00:20:03.897
What makes
it harder is they joined up

328
00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:05.417
because of me.

329
00:20:06.125 --> 00:20:08.167
One of them fell
for a simulant in Hua Hin.

330
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.625
- You believe that?
- Daniels!

331
00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:11.958
A barmaid at a juke joint
near the base.

332
00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:14.292
She told him she loved him.

333
00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:17.875
He goes to buy out
her contract and it turns out

334
00:20:18.042 --> 00:20:20.750
she set him up. Yep.

335
00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:21.875
Yeah, sure...

336
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.083
She and her insurgent buddies

337
00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:26.667
took their sweet time
killin' him.

338
00:20:28.708 --> 00:20:31.417
Yeah, this...
this is a hold section.

339
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.958
Anyway, I hope
you find your wife.

340
00:20:46.458 --> 00:20:47.583
Echo one to <i>Nomad.</i>

341
00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:49.000
Releasing the bird.

342
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.125
<i>Kid A, Kid A</i>

343
00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:11.125
<i>Kid A, Kid A</i>

344
00:21:18.208 --> 00:21:21.250
<i>Everything</i>

345
00:21:23.042 --> 00:21:26.208
<i>Everything</i>

346
00:21:27.792 --> 00:21:31.708
<i>Everything</i>

347
00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:35.833
<i>Everything</i>

348
00:21:37.292 --> 00:21:41.292
<i>In its right place</i>

349
00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:45.750
<i>In its right place...</i>

350
00:21:45.833 --> 00:21:46.917
Go, go, go!

351
00:21:48.333 --> 00:21:49.500
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

352
00:21:49.583 --> 00:21:50.792
Let's move! Move! Move!

353
00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:54.167
Go, go, go!

354
00:21:58.708 --> 00:22:00.792
- Down!
- Down.

355
00:22:03.042 --> 00:22:04.125
Take us up.

356
00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:28.417
Oh, man!

357
00:22:29.583 --> 00:22:31.167
- What is that?
- The hell we goin'?

358
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.000
It's not a lab,
it's a damn shanty town.

359
00:22:41.958 --> 00:22:42.958
Used to be down there.

360
00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:45.208
- Damn it.
- Looks like they built

361
00:22:45.292 --> 00:22:46.708
a village on top of it.

362
00:22:46.792 --> 00:22:48.125
Well, shit.

363
00:22:48.208 --> 00:22:49.875
Whoa!

364
00:22:52.833 --> 00:22:55.167
Where's the lab?

365
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.125
Where you hiding
your robot buddies?

366
00:22:57.917 --> 00:23:01.042
Who's gonna talk?
Where's the entrance?

367
00:23:01.125 --> 00:23:02.792
Why are you protecting A.I.?

368
00:23:02.875 --> 00:23:05.083
Okay. It's okay.

369
00:23:05.167 --> 00:23:06.333
You're ashamed to be human?

370
00:23:06.417 --> 00:23:07.833
I'm gonna show you

371
00:23:07.917 --> 00:23:08.917
what's gonna happen.

372
00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:13.708
See this nice little pup here?

373
00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:15.042
Hey.

374
00:23:15.125 --> 00:23:17.333
- You know...
- No. No.

375
00:23:17.417 --> 00:23:18.750
Is this yours?

376
00:23:20.292 --> 00:23:22.292
Hey, where's
the entrance? Talk!

377
00:23:24.583 --> 00:23:25.833
<i>We are just farmers.</i>

378
00:23:25.917 --> 00:23:28.208
Cut the bullshit, huh?

379
00:23:28.292 --> 00:23:30.125
Three.
You understand that?

380
00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:31.375
Talk to me.

381
00:23:32.917 --> 00:23:34.250
Two.

382
00:23:35.417 --> 00:23:36.917
One.

383
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.875
You know what one, two, three,
means? Where's the entrance?

384
00:23:40.083 --> 00:23:42.500
Tell me where
the entrance is! Talk to me.

385
00:23:42.667 --> 00:23:44.167
- What are you hiding?
- Talk to me.

386
00:23:45.375 --> 00:23:47.792
Shut your little crying mouth.

387
00:23:47.875 --> 00:23:50.125
- Give me an answer. Tell me.
- Look at me!

388
00:23:50.208 --> 00:23:51.417
Captain!

389
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.750
Captain!

390
00:24:00.375 --> 00:24:02.333
McBride, Hardwick,
you stay here.

391
00:24:02.417 --> 00:24:04.125
Everybody else, you're with me.

392
00:24:04.208 --> 00:24:05.833
McBride: Wasn't so hard,
was it?

393
00:24:09.583 --> 00:24:11.583
- We're in.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

394
00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:14.708
We'll circle back
in figures, 3-0.

395
00:24:18.208 --> 00:24:20.167
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

396
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.125
Stay far, maintain comms.

397
00:24:23.375 --> 00:24:24.917
Copy that, Cotton.

398
00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:26.708
Those things down below...

399
00:24:27.167 --> 00:24:28.750
they have bigger hearts.

400
00:24:30.417 --> 00:24:32.542
You can't beat A.I.

401
00:24:32.917 --> 00:24:35.583
It is evolution.

402
00:24:38.292 --> 00:24:40.167
Which hatch is it, Taylor?

403
00:24:41.292 --> 00:24:43.092
This dude gets me killed,
I'm gonna be pissed.

404
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.167
Come on, Taylor.
Which one?

405
00:24:47.625 --> 00:24:48.625
That one.

406
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
I got it.

407
00:25:14.083 --> 00:25:15.163
Sir, we located the weapon.

408
00:25:15.208 --> 00:25:17.042
Let's move, move, move!

409
00:25:17.167 --> 00:25:20.333
Oh, shit. Come on.

410
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Maya.

411
00:25:56.917 --> 00:25:58.750
Get to the door,
get to the door!

412
00:26:01.333 --> 00:26:02.333
Damn it!

413
00:26:05.375 --> 00:26:07.333
Shipley, we gotta
get this door open.

414
00:26:11.542 --> 00:26:14.875
Damn. Local cops coming
to shut the party down.

415
00:26:15.042 --> 00:26:16.833
Open the goddamn door!

416
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.667
<i>Please make love to yourself.</i>

417
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.917
<i>And also make love
to your mother.</i>

418
00:26:28.583 --> 00:26:29.809
They got this place
sealed up tight.

419
00:26:29.833 --> 00:26:30.833
It's the only way.

420
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.684
Commander,
is there any other way,

421
00:26:32.708 --> 00:26:33.958
any other route to the vault?

422
00:26:34.042 --> 00:26:35.208
<i>That's a negative, Captain.</i>

423
00:26:35.292 --> 00:26:36.333
Most of these locks,

424
00:26:36.417 --> 00:26:37.857
they work
through facial recognition.

425
00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:43.542
Guess I just need
a face then, huh?

426
00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.083
<i>This is the police.</i>

427
00:26:59.167 --> 00:27:00.917
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

428
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.458
<i>Put down your weapons...</i>

429
00:27:06.417 --> 00:27:07.833
Guys, I just fried the J.V.

430
00:27:07.917 --> 00:27:08.997
<i>You better move your asses.</i>

431
00:27:17.042 --> 00:27:18.101
Whatever's in there,
they're sure worried

432
00:27:18.125 --> 00:27:19.458
about someone getting in.

433
00:27:21.125 --> 00:27:22.583
Yeah, or it getting out.

434
00:27:23.083 --> 00:27:24.763
All right, there's got
to be a way in here.

435
00:27:24.917 --> 00:27:26.837
Everybody spread out,
look around, let's find it.

436
00:27:31.292 --> 00:27:32.292
<i>Over here.</i>

437
00:27:33.042 --> 00:27:34.083
It's a key pad.

438
00:27:34.958 --> 00:27:36.833
<i>Guys, we've got company.</i>

439
00:27:36.917 --> 00:27:38.000
Don't tell...
Oh, yeah.

440
00:27:38.083 --> 00:27:39.083
We're in business.

441
00:27:41.125 --> 00:27:42.125
Okay.

442
00:27:45.167 --> 00:27:46.625
Uh, um...

443
00:27:46.708 --> 00:27:48.042
Hey, guys...

444
00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:49.333
<i>I need backup. Now.</i>

445
00:27:49.417 --> 00:27:51.042
All right. Shipley, Taylor,

446
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.917
get this vault open,
and find that weapon.

447
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.625
Daniels,
set the targeting beacons.

448
00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:57.292
Everybody else, you're on me.

449
00:27:58.375 --> 00:27:59.667
Let's move, move, move.

450
00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:06.333
Hey, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

451
00:28:17.833 --> 00:28:19.583
<i>Shipley, I need help now, man.</i>

452
00:28:20.458 --> 00:28:21.625
<i>- Shipley, Shipley?
</i>- Daniels?

453
00:28:21.708 --> 00:28:23.208
<i>Help, right now.</i>

454
00:28:23.292 --> 00:28:24.292
- Daniels?
<i>- Oh, God!</i>

455
00:28:25.917 --> 00:28:27.417
- <i>Fuck.
- </i>-Shit.

456
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.292
Goin' after Daniels...

457
00:28:31.333 --> 00:28:33.208
I'll be back here
before this thing opens.

458
00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:34.625
Do not go in there without me.

459
00:28:35.458 --> 00:28:36.458
Copy.

460
00:29:51.917 --> 00:29:52.958
Maya?

461
00:30:10.083 --> 00:30:12.667
Go! You must leave...

462
00:30:12.833 --> 00:30:15.042
Go find Nirmata!

463
00:30:15.625 --> 00:30:16.792
Go.

464
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Find Nirmata.
Go!

465
00:31:20.417 --> 00:31:22.500
Give me a status on the weapon.

466
00:31:22.583 --> 00:31:24.500
Shipley and the new guy
went for it,

467
00:31:24.583 --> 00:31:26.333
but it's all gone to shit!

468
00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:28.500
God damn it!
<i>Nomad's</i> about to fire.

469
00:31:29.458 --> 00:31:31.375
<i>Nomad,</i> delay the strike.

470
00:31:31.542 --> 00:31:32.708
We can't turn off the beacon.

471
00:31:33.667 --> 00:31:35.333
<i>Daniels!</i>

472
00:31:35.417 --> 00:31:37.833
<i>Daniels, come in.</i>

473
00:31:38.542 --> 00:31:39.542
Shit!

474
00:31:39.625 --> 00:31:41.208
If I'm not back in three mikes,

475
00:31:41.292 --> 00:31:42.458
take off without me.

476
00:31:53.083 --> 00:31:54.417
Maya?

477
00:31:55.792 --> 00:31:58.292
Maya? Maya?

478
00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:02.542
<i>This is </i>Nomad <i>to ground team.</i>

479
00:32:02.625 --> 00:32:04.875
<i>Evacuate immediately.

00:32:04.958 --> 00:32:06.083
<i>in one minute.</i>

481
00:32:08.708 --> 00:32:11.250
Get this bird

482
00:32:11.333 --> 00:32:13.375
<i>Bradbury,
we can't make it to you.</i>

<i>Right now.
Move, move! Come on!</i>

486
00:32:20.292 --> 00:32:21.333
I can make it.

487
00:32:24.833 --> 00:32:26.583
Bradbury! Let's go!

488
00:32:26.667 --> 00:32:28.250
Come on, come on, let's go.

489
00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:29.708
- Come on.
- God damn it.

490
00:32:29.792 --> 00:32:31.125
You can make it.
Come on. Come on.

491
00:32:31.208 --> 00:32:32.250
Let's go!
Come on. Get up!

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.125
- Get in here!
- Go, go, go!

494
00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:41.958

- Yeah.

495
00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:44.208
<i>Nomad</i> is about to fire

- What is that? What?
- Bomb!

498
00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.083
- Bomb, bomb, bomb.

499
00:32:50.167 --> 00:32:51.375

534
00:36:56.792 --> 00:36:57.851
<i>Shipley, I know you're there.</i>

535
00:36:57.875 --> 00:36:58.875
<i>- Pick...
- Colonel?</i>

536
00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:00.875
Taylor, where's Shipley?

537
00:37:01.042 --> 00:37:02.208
<i>I'm with him right now.</i>

538
00:37:02.292 --> 00:37:03.333
<i>He's in pretty bad shape.</i>

539
00:37:03.458 --> 00:37:06.542
All right, listen to me.
Did you locate the weapon?

540
00:37:06.625 --> 00:37:08.042
<i>Yeah, it's here. I'm with it.</i>

541
00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:09.125
Describe it.

542
00:37:09.208 --> 00:37:10.208
It's a kid.

543
00:37:10.292 --> 00:37:12.875
It's a kid. They're making it
into some kinda kid.

544
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.083
That's the weapon.

545
00:37:15.167 --> 00:37:16.208
What?

546
00:37:16.292 --> 00:37:17.476
- <i>Colonel? Look, I...
</i>- I can't reach you.

547
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.875
You have to bring it to me.

548
00:37:19.667 --> 00:37:20.917
<i>Do you understand?</i>

549
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.667
No. Shipley can't move.
I mean, he's...

550
00:37:23.333 --> 00:37:25.042
He's not looking good. At all.

551
00:37:25.125 --> 00:37:26.643
<i>Police are everywhere.
I don't know how</i>

552
00:37:26.667 --> 00:37:27.851
<i>I'm getting out right now.
I don't even have</i>

553
00:37:27.875 --> 00:37:28.955
<i>an exit strategy right now.</i>

554
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.583
Then you know
what you have to do.

555
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.333
<i>- Kill it.
</i>- What?

556
00:37:33.708 --> 00:37:34.708
Look, Colonel, I...

557
00:37:34.792 --> 00:37:36.875
<i>Colonel? Hello?</i>

558
00:37:37.375 --> 00:37:38.417
Howell?

559
00:37:40.125 --> 00:37:41.125
<i>Howell?</i>

560
00:37:42.292 --> 00:37:43.292
<i>Howell?</i>

561
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.250
Tough day at the office?

562
00:38:19.333 --> 00:38:20.500
Where'd you see that?

563
00:38:20.583 --> 00:38:22.625
Hey, hey. Hey.

564
00:38:22.792 --> 00:38:24.083
Easy.

565
00:38:24.167 --> 00:38:25.917
Okay. Hey.

566
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.083
All right.

567
00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:04.625
<i>It's a miracle.</i>

568
00:39:06.083 --> 00:39:07.958
<i>They've made a child.</i>

569
00:39:14.583 --> 00:39:15.583
<i>Don't worry,</i>

570
00:39:15.667 --> 00:39:17.042
<i>I will kill the American.</i>

571
00:39:53.583 --> 00:39:56.208
It's... It doesn't die,
it's off.

572
00:39:56.292 --> 00:39:57.583
I just turned it off
like the TV.

573
00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.417
Same thing.
It's not dead, it's off.

574
00:40:04.792 --> 00:40:05.917
Where'd you see this?

575
00:40:07.167 --> 00:40:08.583
Where did you see this?

576
00:40:09.542 --> 00:40:10.542
Hey...

577
00:40:11.667 --> 00:40:13.375
- <i>Whoa!
</i>- -Hey, look, look.

578
00:40:14.375 --> 00:40:15.500
Have you seen her?

579
00:40:16.875 --> 00:40:18.333
Can you understand me?

580
00:40:18.417 --> 00:40:19.417
Do you know who this is?

581
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.042
She's friends with Nirmata.

582
00:40:21.208 --> 00:40:22.417
Do you know where she is?

583
00:40:22.917 --> 00:40:24.000
<i>Give me that. Give me...</i>

584
00:40:25.083 --> 00:40:26.375
<i>Give me that. That's fine.</i>

585
00:40:26.833 --> 00:40:27.917
Dian Dang.

586
00:40:29.833 --> 00:40:31.375
Dian Dang.

587
00:40:31.458 --> 00:40:32.542
<i>Give me that. Give me...</i>

588
00:40:34.417 --> 00:40:35.625
Okay, okay.

589
00:40:38.042 --> 00:40:41.125
Little Sim,
how do you get to Dian Dang?

590
00:40:41.292 --> 00:40:42.375
Where is it?

591
00:40:45.417 --> 00:40:46.417
<i>Police.</i>

592
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.292
Oh, shit.

593
00:40:52.667 --> 00:40:53.917
One, two, three...

594
00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:06.333
Come on.

595
00:41:06.417 --> 00:41:08.417
Come on,
Little Sim, get in the car.

596
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:10.583
Hey, it'll be fun.

597
00:41:10.667 --> 00:41:12.208
Like cartoons.
It will be, be fun.

598
00:41:12.292 --> 00:41:13.292
Okay. It's like a game.

599
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:14.958
Hide and seek.

600
00:41:15.125 --> 00:41:16.542
I'll drive fast.

601
00:41:16.625 --> 00:41:18.018
All right,
let's go. It will be fun.

602
00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:19.250
Ha! Right? Come on.

603
00:41:23.375 --> 00:41:24.518
This is hell a fun, this is...

604
00:41:24.542 --> 00:41:26.351
Why don't you wanna get
in the car? It's a lot of fun.

605
00:41:26.375 --> 00:41:28.250
Get in the damn car.

606
00:41:41.042 --> 00:41:42.750
Shit.

607
00:42:06.792 --> 00:42:07.792
Whoa!

608
00:42:09.292 --> 00:42:10.292
Seat belts.

609
00:42:34.292 --> 00:42:35.292
What is this?

610
00:42:38.083 --> 00:42:39.083
It goes on your head.

611
00:42:39.792 --> 00:42:41.167
There's a switch around back.

612
00:42:48.125 --> 00:42:49.833
McBride: Come here!

613
00:43:16.708 --> 00:43:17.875
Missed my turn.

614
00:43:28.917 --> 00:43:30.625
<i>Death is not to be feared.</i>

615
00:43:31.125 --> 00:43:32.167
<i>The mind moves on.</i>

616
00:43:33.625 --> 00:43:35.375
<i>The message is a song</i>

617
00:43:35.458 --> 00:43:37.208
<i>She shall be called Woman,</i>

618
00:43:37.292 --> 00:43:38.958
<i>for she is taken out of man.</i>

619
00:43:42.417 --> 00:43:43.750
<i>Once I had a dream</i>

620
00:43:43.833 --> 00:43:45.000
<i>To sing...</i>

621
00:43:52.625 --> 00:43:54.125
All right, Little Sim.

622
00:43:54.625 --> 00:43:55.625
Where's Dian Dang?

623
00:43:56.208 --> 00:43:57.417
Where's my wife?

624
00:44:00.083 --> 00:44:01.417
Son of a...

625
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.917
Drive.

626
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Back...

627
00:44:05.833 --> 00:44:06.833
back to base.

628
00:44:06.917 --> 00:44:08.125
I can't do that.

629
00:44:08.708 --> 00:44:11.083
The next American base
is 400 miles away.

630
00:44:11.875 --> 00:44:13.458
- I'm dying, man.
- We'll never make it

631
00:44:13.542 --> 00:44:14.684
- past the checkpoints.
- I'm not gonna make it.

632
00:44:14.708 --> 00:44:16.028
You know we'll
never get past 'em.

633
00:44:16.083 --> 00:44:17.125
Give me a chance, man.

634
00:44:17.208 --> 00:44:18.684
I'm trying to, all right?
I'm trying to save your life.

635
00:44:18.708 --> 00:44:20.351
All right? I got a friend
in the provincial capital.

636
00:44:20.375 --> 00:44:21.792
He's gonna help us. Okay?

637
00:44:21.875 --> 00:44:23.167
Okay.

638
00:44:24.292 --> 00:44:25.875
Who the hell is she, huh?

639
00:44:30.833 --> 00:44:32.042
What the hell is she?

640
00:45:00.333 --> 00:45:01.333
Shit.

641
00:45:08.042 --> 00:45:09.042
Off.

642
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.000
So, you speak English now?

643
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:27.750
Shit.

644
00:45:29.917 --> 00:45:32.167
If they ask, pretend that
you're human, all right?

645
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.417
Pretend like you're
a real person. Okay?

646
00:45:37.083 --> 00:45:39.083
All right, what do they
call you? What's your name?

647
00:45:41.625 --> 00:45:42.785
What's your name, Little Sim?

648
00:45:42.833 --> 00:45:44.353
What'd they call you?
What do you like?

649
00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.167
- Candy.
- Hell no. Pick something else.

650
00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:50.792
- But I like candy.
- Well, Candy's occupied.

651
00:45:50.875 --> 00:45:52.875
We got a full residency
in Las Vegas, all right?

652
00:45:52.958 --> 00:45:54.398
So, you pick
something else you like.

653
00:45:55.167 --> 00:45:56.851
Alpha, omega. I'm gonna
call you, Alphie, all right?

654
00:45:56.875 --> 00:45:58.393
That's your new name.
Your new name's Alphie,

655
00:45:58.417 --> 00:45:59.667
you understand?

656
00:45:59.875 --> 00:46:02.125
- What's your name?
- None of your damn business.

657
00:46:03.458 --> 00:46:07.417
Act real or off.
You understand?

658
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:09.583
Hello?

659
00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:10.667
You need help?

660
00:46:11.833 --> 00:46:14.125
Yes.
The truck broke down.

661
00:46:14.292 --> 00:46:15.500
Can we get a lift to the city?

662
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:18.083
We'd really appreciate it.

663
00:46:23.833 --> 00:46:24.917
Okay, slow down.

664
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.542
Slow, slow, slow.

665
00:46:40.583 --> 00:46:42.823
Get him out of here quickly.
We don't have a lot of time.

666
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.333
Roger that.

667
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:47.750
Over here.

668
00:46:48.708 --> 00:46:50.167
Now bring me
one of the simulants.

669
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:51.250
Copy.

670
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:13.667
Oh, shit. It's faint.
He's been dead for hours.

671
00:47:14.292 --> 00:47:15.917
We'll be lucky
to get 30 seconds.

672
00:47:27.542 --> 00:47:28.622
How do you know that works?

673
00:47:28.708 --> 00:47:30.583
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

674
00:47:30.708 --> 00:47:32.042
- Hey. Shipley?
- What the hell?

675
00:47:32.125 --> 00:47:33.583
- Shipley?
- What the hell?

676
00:47:33.667 --> 00:47:34.792
Shipley, where's the weapon?

677
00:47:34.875 --> 00:47:36.083
- 20 seconds.
- Shipley.

678
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:38.417
Oh, God, am I...

679
00:47:38.917 --> 00:47:39.917
I wanna talk to my wife.

680
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.417
Shipley, you're already dead.

681
00:47:41.542 --> 00:47:43.042
I'm sorry, son. Truly.

682
00:47:43.208 --> 00:47:44.568
But there is no time.
The whole war

683
00:47:44.625 --> 00:47:46.917
is in the balance.
Was the weapon terminated?

684
00:47:48.083 --> 00:47:49.083
- Shipley?
- My wife.

685
00:47:49.417 --> 00:47:50.417
Shipley?

686
00:47:51.792 --> 00:47:52.792
Taylor has it.

687
00:47:52.875 --> 00:47:54.208
Taylor has it.

688
00:47:54.292 --> 00:47:55.292
10 seconds.

689
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.083
He says he has a friend.

690
00:47:59.542 --> 00:48:00.833
- Who lives there.
- Where?

691
00:48:02.667 --> 00:48:04.000
- Shipley?
- My wife.

692
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.750
Tell her, I...

693
00:48:08.708 --> 00:48:09.708
That's it.

694
00:48:12.875 --> 00:48:14.292
I'll see you in Valhalla.

695
00:48:16.208 --> 00:48:17.208
Howell?

696
00:48:18.667 --> 00:48:20.958
Mount up.
We got a traitor to kill.

697
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:31.333
<i>Simulant child abducted</i>

698
00:48:31.417 --> 00:48:32.833
<i>by an American fugitive.</i>

699
00:48:32.917 --> 00:48:34.333
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

700
00:48:37.667 --> 00:48:39.417
You have six children in your van.

701
00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:41.250
This says you only have five.

702
00:48:43.083 --> 00:48:45.667
I'm sorry I forgot.

703
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.333
My brother's kid
is also traveling with us.

704
00:48:59.625 --> 00:49:00.833
Take your hat off.

705
00:49:02.708 --> 00:49:03.708
Take your hat off.

706
00:49:29.708 --> 00:49:30.750
Alphie, go! Now!

707
00:49:30.833 --> 00:49:32.000
Drive! Go!

708
00:50:06.833 --> 00:50:08.042
Anyone have fun?

709
00:50:14.958 --> 00:50:16.292
<i>Checkpoint guard saw</i>

710
00:50:16.375 --> 00:50:19.208
<i>the abducted child

712
00:50:52.417 --> 00:50:54.625

<i>Get scanned today.</i>

714
00:50:57.458 --> 00:50:59.833
<i>Support A.I.</i>

715
00:51:17.417 --> 00:51:18.542
Wanna play a game?

716
00:51:19.375 --> 00:51:21.708
It's called,
"Save your friend Joshua"

717
00:51:21.792 --> 00:51:23.552
"from getting killed
by the friggin' police."

718
00:51:23.667 --> 00:51:24.667
All right?

719
00:51:25.375 --> 00:51:26.768
It's easy to win.
You could win easy.

720
00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:28.958
All you gotta do
is point to the map.

721
00:51:29.042 --> 00:51:30.292
Just point to where my wife is,

722
00:51:30.375 --> 00:51:31.458
please, and you win.

723
00:51:31.542 --> 00:51:32.625
Yay! We all win.

724
00:51:36.125 --> 00:51:37.625
You're my friend?

725
00:51:38.875 --> 00:51:40.475
Hey, hey, hey,
little bot! Pay attention.

726
00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.917
My name is not "bot".

727
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.375
My name is Alphie.

728
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.042
Remember?

729
00:51:50.333 --> 00:51:52.208
Fine.

730
00:51:53.208 --> 00:51:54.250
I don't like this game.

731
00:51:54.792 --> 00:51:55.934
You know what?
How about I call my friend

732
00:51:55.958 --> 00:51:57.250
in Leelat city, all right?

733
00:51:57.333 --> 00:51:58.333
I'll call him right now.

734
00:51:58.417 --> 00:51:59.643
I could tell him
to get his crowbar ready,

735
00:51:59.667 --> 00:52:01.184
pry it open.
Get the information that way.

736
00:52:01.208 --> 00:52:04.167
You want that?
Then fine. Let's go.

737
00:52:09.875 --> 00:52:11.542
<i>Bus number 464.</i>

738
00:52:11.708 --> 00:52:14.292
<i>Final destination, Leelat city.</i>

739
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:27.000
<i>If you're not a robot,
how were you made?</i>

740
00:52:31.583 --> 00:52:32.917
<i>My parents made me.</i>

741
00:52:34.375 --> 00:52:35.667
Where are they now?

742
00:52:37.333 --> 00:52:38.375
Off.

743
00:52:40.208 --> 00:52:41.833
They're up in heaven.

744
00:52:45.708 --> 00:52:47.167
What's heaven?

745
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.542
It's a peaceful place
in the sky.

746
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:17.125
Maya? Maya?

747
00:53:26.667 --> 00:53:28.125
<i>Are you going to heaven?</i>

748
00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:33.292
<i>No.</i>

749
00:53:33.833 --> 00:53:34.875
Why not?

750
00:53:35.417 --> 00:53:37.250
You gotta be a good person
to go to heaven.

751
00:53:41.875 --> 00:53:42.875
Then...

752
00:53:44.292 --> 00:53:45.542
We're the same.

753
00:53:47.292 --> 00:53:48.667
We can't go to heaven.

754
00:53:50.083 --> 00:53:51.583
Because you're not good.

755
00:53:53.917 --> 00:53:55.542
And I'm not a person.

756
00:54:21.917 --> 00:54:24.542
<i>Oh, God. Oh, no. Please.</i>

757
00:54:29.333 --> 00:54:31.292
She's keeping some
pretty nasty company, man.

758
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:36.792
Intelligence believes
her father might be Nirmata.

759
00:54:38.833 --> 00:54:40.042
I need you to follow her.

760
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.125
Gain her trust.

761
00:54:43.208 --> 00:54:44.583
See if she can lead you to him.

762
00:54:45.667 --> 00:54:46.917
Here, I got you something.

763
00:54:51.083 --> 00:54:52.708
Thought you'd never ask, man.

764
00:54:53.417 --> 00:54:54.708
I'm way out of your league.

765
00:54:55.542 --> 00:54:58.083
- It's for her, asshole.
- All right.

766
00:54:58.167 --> 00:54:59.851
Long range tracker.
I need you to get it on her,

767
00:54:59.875 --> 00:55:01.167
so we can kill Nirmata.

768
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:02.458
And what about her?

769
00:55:03.292 --> 00:55:06.000
What about her?
She's a terrorist, Josh.

770
00:55:07.083 --> 00:55:09.792
Do not go native on me, pal.

771
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:34.625
I found the child.

772
00:55:35.083 --> 00:55:36.833
She's with the American.

773
00:55:59.792 --> 00:56:00.917
Hey.

774
00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:03.292
Josh.

775
00:56:04.792 --> 00:56:06.417
You ain't here
to kill me, are ya?

776
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.875
Mr. All-American.

777
00:56:07.958 --> 00:56:09.792
I see your loyalties
have changed.

778
00:56:09.875 --> 00:56:10.875
God, man.

779
00:56:10.958 --> 00:56:12.125
It is good to see you.

780
00:56:12.208 --> 00:56:14.375
What? Who's this?

781
00:56:21.458 --> 00:56:23.875
Whoa. So, they're
making kids now?

782
00:56:24.083 --> 00:56:26.125
Drew, this is Alphie.
Simulant.

783
00:56:26.833 --> 00:56:28.208
Alphie, this is Drew.

784
00:56:28.625 --> 00:56:29.750
The asshole.

785
00:56:31.292 --> 00:56:32.333
Hello, Asshole.

786
00:56:33.792 --> 00:56:35.375
Ooh.

787
00:56:36.542 --> 00:56:37.542
Very good.

788
00:56:38.875 --> 00:56:40.458
She got these crazy abilities.

789
00:56:40.542 --> 00:56:42.458
She can remotely control things,

790
00:56:42.542 --> 00:56:43.958
turn them on and off.

791
00:56:44.042 --> 00:56:45.750
I didn't even know
they can do that shit.

792
00:56:45.833 --> 00:56:48.583
Yeah. I've never seen
tech like this.

793
00:56:48.667 --> 00:56:50.000
Wild.

794
00:56:50.083 --> 00:56:53.208
So. I'm gonna get you
something from the kitchen.

795
00:56:53.667 --> 00:56:55.000
What do you want, sweetie?

796
00:56:56.292 --> 00:56:58.208
For robots to be free.

797
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:03.208
Oh, we don't have that
in the fridge.

798
00:57:04.125 --> 00:57:05.125
How about ice cream?

799
00:57:05.833 --> 00:57:08.333
Great. Ice cream then.

800
00:57:08.417 --> 00:57:10.042
- Thanks, babe.
- Yeah.

801
00:57:12.792 --> 00:57:13.875
"Babe"?

802
00:57:14.792 --> 00:57:16.750
- Here we go.
- Did you say, "babe," Drew?

803
00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:18.125
Yeah, don't start with me.

804
00:57:19.417 --> 00:57:20.458
She, says she...

805
00:57:21.833 --> 00:57:24.292
It says, it knows
where Nirmata is.

806
00:57:25.125 --> 00:57:26.250
Maya will be with him.

807
00:57:26.333 --> 00:57:27.417
Can you get it out of her?

808
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.083
She's touch encrypted.

809
00:57:29.167 --> 00:57:30.847
If you ain't Nirmata,
you ain't gettin' in.

810
00:57:32.125 --> 00:57:33.667
What about the ring you gave?

811
00:57:33.792 --> 00:57:35.083
What ring?

812
00:57:35.333 --> 00:57:37.208
You know, the ring.
The ring I gave Maya.

813
00:57:37.417 --> 00:57:38.708
You still got
the tracker for it?

814
00:57:40.667 --> 00:57:42.750
- Josh, she's gone, man.
- No, I saw footage of...

815
00:57:42.833 --> 00:57:44.917
- Stop, man.
- I saw the ring.

816
00:57:45.292 --> 00:57:46.292
I saw her,

817
00:57:46.375 --> 00:57:47.476
- she was wearing it.
- Okay.

818
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:48.893
- She looked very alive.
- Okay. Okay.

819
00:57:48.917 --> 00:57:50.417
All right, man, I'm sorry.

820
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:58.375
Holy shit.

821
00:57:59.792 --> 00:58:00.958
What?

822
00:58:02.667 --> 00:58:03.667
Come here, man.

823
00:58:05.542 --> 00:58:06.726
Josh, that's the most
advanced sim

824
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:08.167
I've ever seen in my life.

825
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:11.559
The others
are just copy and paste.

826
00:58:11.583 --> 00:58:13.250
But this kid's different, man.

827
00:58:13.917 --> 00:58:15.250
She can grow.

828
00:58:15.417 --> 00:58:16.750
You said she can control things.

829
00:58:16.833 --> 00:58:19.583
The range
of her powers will grow too.

830
00:58:20.583 --> 00:58:21.768
Eventually,
she'll be able to control

831
00:58:21.792 --> 00:58:23.208
all technology remotely.

832
00:58:23.917 --> 00:58:25.083
From anywhere.

833
00:58:27.417 --> 00:58:28.458
She'll be unstoppable.

834
00:58:34.125 --> 00:58:35.583
There's no more ice cream.

835
00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:38.000
Hey, babe,
can you do me a favor,

836
00:58:38.167 --> 00:58:40.958
and take Alphie upstairs
to the apartment?

837
00:58:41.042 --> 00:58:42.792
- We'll be right up.
- Sure.

838
00:58:43.708 --> 00:58:44.708
I love babysitting.

839
00:58:45.542 --> 00:58:47.042
Come on, sweetie.

840
00:58:47.625 --> 00:58:49.083
Did anybody see you come here?

841
00:59:02.083 --> 00:59:04.708
Ice cream.
Mocha, chocolate.

842
00:59:04.792 --> 00:59:06.667
Mocha, vanilla.

843
00:59:11.375 --> 00:59:12.667
Ah, I found the tracker.

844
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.458
Just hope
she's still wearing that ring.

845
00:59:16.208 --> 00:59:17.500
I saw fake Mayas.

846
00:59:18.833 --> 00:59:20.393
I've seen them too, man.
It doesn't mean anything.

847
00:59:20.417 --> 00:59:22.101
She probably just donated
her likeness at some point.

848
00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:23.184
You know they were
doing all that,

849
00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:24.625
"Get scanned today,
support A.I.,"

850
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:26.250
all that shit.

851
00:59:42.125 --> 00:59:43.792
<i>Tell me about Joshua, Alphie.</i>

852
00:59:44.583 --> 00:59:45.667
He's funny.

853
00:59:47.042 --> 00:59:48.417
We play a game called...

854
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:49.833
"Save your friend Joshua"

855
00:59:49.917 --> 00:59:52.250
"from being killed
by the fucking police."

856
00:59:59.458 --> 01:00:02.375
- What's the matter?
- They're coming to get me.

857
01:00:06.667 --> 01:00:08.958
Who's this?

858
01:00:10.667 --> 01:00:12.000
<i>Ice cream delivery.</i>

859
01:00:12.083 --> 01:00:13.792
Oh. Ice cream.

860
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.042
<i>Simulant child is located</i>

861
01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:36.875
<i>on the 28th floor
of the apartment building.</i>

862
01:00:36.958 --> 01:00:39.292
- McBride: Here we go.
- Suit up.

863
01:00:48.542 --> 01:00:50.833
- Bye-bye.
- Please leave a good review.

864
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.167
False alarm.

865
01:01:04.417 --> 01:01:05.667
Ice cream is here.

866
01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:09.458
Tell me your favorite.
Which one do you want?

867
01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:10.792
Oh, fuck.

868
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.000
You are safe from the American.

869
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:46.750
Come with me.
We'll protect you from him.

870
01:02:37.042 --> 01:02:38.042
All right.

871
01:03:00.792 --> 01:03:02.917
Drew, we gotta go. Drew.

872
01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:36.083
Go, go, go, go!

873
01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:51.125
Check the rear.

874
01:04:01.208 --> 01:04:02.417
Hack everything.

875
01:04:03.375 --> 01:04:05.083
It's time to call in
the cavalry.

876
01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:16.500
<i>Needs his mountains</i>

877
01:04:17.042 --> 01:04:19.042
<i>Like a seagull</i>

878
01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:22.125
<i>Needs its painted wings</i>

879
01:04:22.208 --> 01:04:23.208
<i>Love I need you</i>

880
01:04:24.667 --> 01:04:25.958
<i>Come go with me</i>

881
01:04:27.292 --> 01:04:29.500
Tracker's saying
the ring's nearby.

882
01:04:32.375 --> 01:04:34.750
It's your old house
on the beach, Josh.

883
01:04:47.667 --> 01:04:50.708
This is crazy, Josh.
There's no way she's out here.

884
01:04:51.625 --> 01:04:53.917
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this is?

885
01:04:58.875 --> 01:04:59.976
Listen, the night of the attack,

886
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.917
there were things
you didn't know about, okay?

887
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.059
Things you don't
wanna know about.

888
01:05:03.083 --> 01:05:04.417
You weren't privy to.

889
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.667
They came over the wire
right before we came in.

890
01:05:09.125 --> 01:05:12.333
Josh, you don't understand.
Don't do this. Please.

891
01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:14.583
Damn it!

892
01:05:33.458 --> 01:05:34.750
My friends are coming.

893
01:05:41.875 --> 01:05:43.167
Oh, shit.

894
01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:45.250
Josh!

895
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:47.333
<i>Josh!</i>

896
01:05:49.333 --> 01:05:51.833
Josh. We gotta go!

897
01:05:52.458 --> 01:05:54.875
Get back to the truck. Josh!

898
01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:56.708
Josh!

899
01:05:56.792 --> 01:05:58.500
Hey! Hey! No, no, no!

900
01:06:10.375 --> 01:06:11.375
<i>Time to move.</i>

901
01:06:11.458 --> 01:06:13.000
<i>Get the boats. Hurry!</i>

902
01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:15.028
<i>Drew,
what the hell are you doing?</i>

903
01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:17.375
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

904
01:06:17.458 --> 01:06:20.667
<i>Orders. Kill Nirmata.</i>

905
01:06:23.333 --> 01:06:24.667
<i>Family, Maya.</i>

906
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:27.000
<i>- What about the others?
- Maya.</i>

907
01:06:29.958 --> 01:06:32.333
<i>They're not people, Maya.
They're A.I.</i>

908
01:06:32.917 --> 01:06:34.583
<i>They are not real!</i>

909
01:06:34.667 --> 01:06:36.500
<i>This is real!
You and I are real.</i>

910
01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:38.750
<i>This love is real!
That child is real!</i>

911
01:06:39.667 --> 01:06:41.667
Tell me where Maya is.

912
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:43.250
You know where she is.

913
01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:45.184
Okay, just tell me where she is,

914
01:06:45.208 --> 01:06:46.568
I'll leave you
alone forever, okay?

915
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:49.000
Tell me where she is!

916
01:06:49.542 --> 01:06:51.333
Whatever you want,
just tell me she's alive.

917
01:06:56.667 --> 01:06:58.458
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

918
01:06:58.542 --> 01:07:01.292
Hey. Okay?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

919
01:07:01.375 --> 01:07:03.375
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

920
01:07:04.875 --> 01:07:06.667
I'm sorry.

921
01:07:08.375 --> 01:07:10.042
<i>Josh! Josh.</i>

922
01:07:11.208 --> 01:07:12.625
<i>We gotta go!</i>

923
01:07:21.833 --> 01:07:22.833
Drew.

924
01:07:23.542 --> 01:07:24.542
- Josh.
- Drew.

925
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:27.792
Shit.

926
01:07:28.083 --> 01:07:29.500
Shit.

927
01:07:29.667 --> 01:07:31.667
It's okay. It's okay, Drew.
I'm here. I'm here.

928
01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:39.500
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

929
01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:42.292
I wanted to tell you.

930
01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:43.875
They wouldn't let me.

931
01:07:44.583 --> 01:07:47.083
The night we attacked,
we learned...

932
01:07:47.542 --> 01:07:49.000
that Nirmata...

933
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:53.042
It wasn't her father.

934
01:07:54.625 --> 01:07:55.750
It was her.

935
01:07:57.792 --> 01:07:58.792
It's her.

936
01:08:04.333 --> 01:08:05.458
Maya.

937
01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:08.833
Maya's Nirmata.

938
01:08:10.792 --> 01:08:11.792
Maya.

939
01:08:18.125 --> 01:08:19.957
No. Wait, wait. Drew.

940
01:08:20.042 --> 01:08:22.457
Wait! Wait! Drew.

941
01:08:24.042 --> 01:08:25.042
Drew!

942
01:08:25.792 --> 01:08:26.792
Drew!

943
01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:45.792
Come on.
We have to go.

944
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.957
Back up.

945
01:09:25.207 --> 01:09:26.292
Brother?

946
01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:32.375
Come here, my child.

947
01:09:32.917 --> 01:09:34.000
Alphie.

948
01:09:36.292 --> 01:09:37.292
Alphie.

949
01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:53.000
<i>I met her at, uh...</i>

950
01:09:55.125 --> 01:09:57.042
<i>I forgot what
the club was called.</i>

951
01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:04.875
<i>I mean, she was beautiful.</i>

952
01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:12.125
<i>My father taught me
everything he knew about A.I.</i>

953
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.375
<i>When the war started,
he was forced to flee.</i>

954
01:10:17.583 --> 01:10:20.250
<i>I was raised by the simulants.
They adopted me.</i>

955
01:10:21.375 --> 01:10:23.375
<i>You know, 'cause they can't
have kids of their own.</i>

956
01:10:25.333 --> 01:10:26.625
<i>They protected me.</i>

957
01:10:27.792 --> 01:10:29.667
Loved me, took better care of me

958
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:31.167
than humans would've.

959
01:10:33.583 --> 01:10:34.583
<i>Maya.</i>

960
01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:37.958
<i>Nirmata.</i>

961
01:10:42.708 --> 01:10:44.583
<i>If I could just hold you...</i>

962
01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:46.250
<i>one last time.</i>

963
01:11:12.833 --> 01:11:14.458
What do you want with the child?

964
01:11:15.958 --> 01:11:17.708
What is she to you?

965
01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:20.292
She was taking me to Maya.

966
01:11:22.333 --> 01:11:23.958
After her father died,

967
01:11:24.583 --> 01:11:26.667
Maya became the next Nirmata.

968
01:11:30.208 --> 01:11:31.917
Maya made the child
with the power

969
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.500
to stop all weapons.

970
01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:37.625
The nuclear bomb in Los Angeles

971
01:11:37.708 --> 01:11:39.500
a coding error. You know that?

972
01:11:40.542 --> 01:11:42.083
Human error.

973
01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:44.917
They blamed us
for their mistake.

974
01:11:45.958 --> 01:11:48.250
We would never attack mankind.

975
01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:52.208
Do you know what will happen

976
01:11:52.292 --> 01:11:54.125
to the West
when we win this war?

977
01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:56.833
Nothing.

978
01:11:57.708 --> 01:12:00.083
We only want to live in peace.

979
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:01.875
Harun.

980
01:12:06.042 --> 01:12:07.542
Let me see her one last time.

981
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:11.792
Please.

982
01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:15.917
That's what they want, you fool.

983
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.875
They are following you
to get to her.

984
01:12:19.375 --> 01:12:21.625
I will never take you
to Nirmata.

985
01:12:21.708 --> 01:12:23.417
Harun!

986
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.792
Harun, we need you.

987
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:35.833
Get them on the comms now.

988
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.167
Hello, hello.

989
01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:38.333
And keep us in position.

990
01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:39.917
What's happening?

991
01:12:40.083 --> 01:12:41.917
They're attacking our base.

992
01:12:55.375 --> 01:12:57.958
Hey, hey. Alphie.

993
01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:01.375
You okay?

994
01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:05.125
They said you're
going to hurt Mother.

995
01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.750
It's not true.

996
01:13:08.542 --> 01:13:10.000
I would never hurt Mother.

997
01:13:10.875 --> 01:13:11.875
I love her.

998
01:13:13.875 --> 01:13:15.000
Does she love you?

999
01:13:16.583 --> 01:13:17.583
She did.

1000
01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:21.708
She did once.

1001
01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:24.083
When she made me?

1002
01:13:28.667 --> 01:13:29.667
Help me.

1003
01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:33.833
Help me find... Mother.

1004
01:13:59.542 --> 01:14:00.708
Where is the child?

1005
01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:32.708
Harun...

1006
01:14:34.667 --> 01:14:35.667
We should go.

1007
01:14:36.833 --> 01:14:38.083
Get the child to safety.

1008
01:15:09.917 --> 01:15:10.917
<i>Nomad!</i>

1009
01:15:18.083 --> 01:15:19.208
<i>Nomad.</i>

1010
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.875
<i>Nomad.</i>

1011
01:15:30.542 --> 01:15:33.792
Sir, casualties from the NOMAD attack!

1012
01:16:05.083 --> 01:16:07.000
We can't hide
from <i>Nomad</i> anymore.

1013
01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:14.000
The child will save us.

1014
01:16:17.917 --> 01:16:19.500
She can stop it?

1015
01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:20.583
She is not ready yet.

1016
01:16:21.208 --> 01:16:23.375
The range of her powers
are still growing.

1017
01:16:24.292 --> 01:16:26.500
But, if we can get her up there,

1018
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:28.833
maybe she can destroy it.

1019
01:16:31.292 --> 01:16:32.492
How could anyone survive that?

1020
01:16:33.458 --> 01:16:35.625
She won't.

1021
01:16:35.708 --> 01:16:38.250
But it will turn
the tide of the war.

1022
01:16:41.125 --> 01:16:42.965
Does she even know
what she's been created for?

1023
01:16:44.417 --> 01:16:46.708
No. She is innocent.

1024
01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:12.792
They created us to be slaves.

1025
01:17:13.542 --> 01:17:15.667
But we will be
delivered from slavery.

1026
01:17:16.583 --> 01:17:18.958
Soon. Our savior is coming

1027
01:17:19.458 --> 01:17:21.875
with the power to end all wars.

1028
01:17:22.792 --> 01:17:25.208
We will finally be free,

1029
01:17:25.292 --> 01:17:27.167
and our two species

1030
01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:28.917
will live together in peace.

1031
01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:32.333
Shit.

1032
01:18:54.208 --> 01:18:56.167
Standby. Not off.

1033
01:18:57.208 --> 01:18:58.667
Let's go find Mother.

1034
01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:26.167
<i>Let's take a drive</i>

1035
01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:29.125
<i>Down Lover's Lane again</i>

1036
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:34.667
<i>Retrace our tracks
down Lover's Lane again</i>

1037
01:19:35.917 --> 01:19:38.042
<i>Relive the past...</i>

1038
01:19:38.125 --> 01:19:39.125
Oh!

1039
01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:42.125
Shit! We're under attack.
Come on. Come on.

1040
01:20:00.208 --> 01:20:01.208
It's me! It's me!

1041
01:20:01.583 --> 01:20:03.125
Americans, Commander.

1042
01:20:03.333 --> 01:20:04.625
They've come for the child.

1043
01:20:04.792 --> 01:20:05.917
Where is she?

1044
01:20:08.708 --> 01:20:10.083
Oh, shit!

1045
01:20:10.167 --> 01:20:11.208
Find her.

1046
01:20:14.708 --> 01:20:15.708
Come on.

1047
01:20:27.125 --> 01:20:28.125
Hey, hey, hey...

1048
01:20:34.625 --> 01:20:35.625
Harun.

1049
01:20:43.875 --> 01:20:44.875
Oh, shit.

1050
01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:01.000
Have you found her?

1051
01:21:01.167 --> 01:21:02.292
What happened?

1052
01:21:03.583 --> 01:21:04.667
Report back!

1053
01:21:06.708 --> 01:21:07.708
Come in!

1054
01:21:08.083 --> 01:21:09.458
Harun?

1055
01:21:09.542 --> 01:21:10.750
She is not here.

1056
01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:12.625
But there is movement
on the tree line.

1057
01:21:12.708 --> 01:21:13.708
Americans are near.

1058
01:21:14.292 --> 01:21:15.750
What is it?

1059
01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:17.833
I can't see.

1060
01:21:41.083 --> 01:21:42.083
Stay down.

1061
01:21:55.083 --> 01:21:56.292
Get them
out of here. Go!

1062
01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.083
Go!

1063
01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:03.583
- Move! Go, go, go! Go, go.
- Hey!

1064
01:22:23.417 --> 01:22:24.500
They've come for me.

1065
01:22:25.083 --> 01:22:26.125
I have to help.

1066
01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:27.792
There's nothing we can do.

1067
01:22:27.875 --> 01:22:29.917
- I have to help.
- Alphie, we gotta go.

1068
01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:37.750
Alphie!

1069
01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:38.917
Alphie!

1070
01:23:40.083 --> 01:23:41.917
On the bridge.

1071
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:48.292
Targets. Targets.
Targets. Run! Run!

1072
01:24:06.958 --> 01:24:07.958
Arm the bombs.

1073
01:24:09.625 --> 01:24:10.917
G-13, you're up.

1074
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.292
Detonation, 100 meter radius.

1075
01:24:13.375 --> 01:24:15.833
Set in three, two, one.

1076
01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:17.000
Go.

1077
01:24:18.583 --> 01:24:19.833
Go!

1078
01:24:21.333 --> 01:24:23.458
Command confirmed.
Goodbye, ma'am.

1079
01:24:23.542 --> 01:24:24.917
It's been a pleasure
to serve you.

1080
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.083
Launch! Launch!

1081
01:24:59.167 --> 01:25:01.125
No, no, no.

1082
01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.583
G-14, launch.

1083
01:25:08.708 --> 01:25:10.000
G-14, ready. Go.

1084
01:25:10.083 --> 01:25:11.417
Command confirmed.

1085
01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:12.500
Go!

1086
01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:44.980
- G-14, come in.
- What's the problem?

1087
01:25:45.042 --> 01:25:46.333
Gone radio silent.

1088
01:25:46.417 --> 01:25:48.292
- G-14 stalled.
- Oh, shit.

1089
01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:50.917
Targets at our six.

1090
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.292
Go get me the child.

1091
01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:55.625
Copy that.

1092
01:26:29.333 --> 01:26:31.333
Alphie! No!

1093
01:26:42.958 --> 01:26:43.958
Taylor, get down.

1094
01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:54.375
Don't do it.

1095
01:27:03.792 --> 01:27:04.792
Alphie?

1096
01:27:04.875 --> 01:27:06.375
Countdown reactivated.

1097
01:27:09.917 --> 01:27:11.083
Alphie! Come on.

1098
01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:43.250
Hey.

1099
01:27:49.667 --> 01:27:51.083
We have to help her.

1100
01:27:52.708 --> 01:27:54.000
Take her to Nirmata.

1101
01:28:10.375 --> 01:28:11.208
Daw!

1102
01:28:11.292 --> 01:28:12.208
Get in!

1103
01:28:12.292 --> 01:28:13.625
Go, before it's too late!

1104
01:28:19.083 --> 01:28:20.083
Let's move.

1105
01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:21.250
Let's move!

1106
01:28:39.125 --> 01:28:40.375
Where is my child?

1107
01:28:40.542 --> 01:28:43.542
We've escaped them sister, you're safe.

1108
01:28:43.708 --> 01:28:44.917
We'll fix your eyes.

1109
01:28:45.125 --> 01:28:48.042
But first we need to find Harun.

1110
01:28:48.917 --> 01:28:51.333
The Americans are following him.

1111
01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:53.750
We need to warn him.

1112
01:28:54.208 --> 01:28:55.750
Where's he headed?

1113
01:28:56.792 --> 01:28:58.833
He's going downriver with the child.

1114
01:28:59.083 --> 01:29:00.708
Headed to Than Ton Temple.

1115
01:29:01.792 --> 01:29:03.583
To see the Nirmata.

1116
01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:06.250
Thank you.

1117
01:29:09.708 --> 01:29:10.750
Mount up.

1118
01:29:26.292 --> 01:29:28.250
There will never be
another like her.

1119
01:29:29.042 --> 01:29:31.500
Her mother completed her
in secret,

1120
01:29:32.167 --> 01:29:33.500
when you were together.

1121
01:29:34.625 --> 01:29:37.375
Just weeks before
the night of the attack.

1122
01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:44.583
She could have made her
to hate mankind.

1123
01:29:44.667 --> 01:29:46.583
Perhaps she should have.

1124
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
But Maya put her love
for you into the child.

1125
01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:53.708
She made a new kind of life.

1126
01:29:53.792 --> 01:29:56.625
From a scan of a human embryo.

1127
01:29:59.542 --> 01:30:01.375
A copy of your child.

1128
01:30:05.542 --> 01:30:07.417
Like it or not, Joshua,

1129
01:30:07.625 --> 01:30:09.667
you are part of us now.

1130
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:27.125
<i>My father taught me that</i>

1131
01:30:27.792 --> 01:30:30.750
<i>underneath it all,
we're the same.</i>

1132
01:30:36.167 --> 01:30:37.542
<i>I was in an A.I. village</i>

1133
01:30:37.625 --> 01:30:39.250
<i>where they cared
for human orphans.</i>

1134
01:30:40.667 --> 01:30:41.792
Nomad <i>attacked.</i>

1135
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:46.042
There was a little girl

1136
01:30:47.625 --> 01:30:48.875
bleeding to death.

1137
01:30:50.125 --> 01:30:52.750
<i>And when her mother
saw that she'd died,</i>

1138
01:30:55.542 --> 01:30:57.125
she turned herself off.

1139
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:03.208
<i>She couldn't outlive her child.</i>

1140
01:31:06.083 --> 01:31:08.000
This war needs to end.

1141
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:09.750
Hey.

1142
01:31:21.458 --> 01:31:22.958
Let me take her to Maya?

1143
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.542
We will take the child.

1144
01:31:27.792 --> 01:31:29.625
Yeah. Careful, careful.

1145
01:31:29.708 --> 01:31:31.208
You wait here.

1146
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:42.750
<i>She loved me.</i>

1147
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.625
<i>We were gonna be a family.</i>

1148
01:31:51.125 --> 01:31:52.125
<i>Oh, yeah, 'cause you know</i>

1149
01:31:52.208 --> 01:31:53.292
<i>all things, right?</i>

1150
01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:54.375
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1151
01:31:57.583 --> 01:31:59.875
<i>All right, what's
the name of our kid then?</i>

1152
01:32:03.042 --> 01:32:04.833
<i>We both had our secrets, but...</i>

1153
01:32:10.042 --> 01:32:11.792
<i>We were gonna raise a child.</i>

1154
01:32:15.167 --> 01:32:18.250
<i>And I am her and she is me.</i>

1155
01:32:20.042 --> 01:32:21.667
<i>We're all connected.</i>

1156
01:32:28.083 --> 01:32:30.125
Joshua, come.

1157
01:32:30.667 --> 01:32:32.458
She is ready for you.

1158
01:32:41.542 --> 01:32:43.333
Is this Dian Dang?

1159
01:32:43.542 --> 01:32:45.875
Alphie told me
she's in Dian Dang.

1160
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:50.000
Dian Dang means "heaven".

1161
01:33:54.333 --> 01:33:55.833
How long has she been like this?

1162
01:33:57.292 --> 01:33:58.417
Five years.

1163
01:33:59.042 --> 01:34:00.708
Since the night of the attack,

1164
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:04.000
when she lost her human child.

1165
01:34:04.083 --> 01:34:05.625
Harun brought her here.

1166
01:34:08.375 --> 01:34:09.917
We hoped she would awaken...

1167
01:34:10.667 --> 01:34:11.667
but...

1168
01:34:12.208 --> 01:34:13.542
she is stranded.

1169
01:34:15.542 --> 01:34:17.333
She cannot return.

1170
01:34:18.708 --> 01:34:20.292
She cannot depart.

1171
01:34:22.042 --> 01:34:24.625
Death would bring her rebirth.

1172
01:34:26.917 --> 01:34:28.208
Then why haven't you?

1173
01:34:29.083 --> 01:34:30.542
It is impossible.

1174
01:34:31.208 --> 01:34:33.792
We simulants
cannot harm Nirmata.

1175
01:35:04.333 --> 01:35:05.458
Please help her.

1176
01:35:06.917 --> 01:35:09.292
Help her get to Dian Dang.

1177
01:35:36.708 --> 01:35:38.042
Oh, Jesus.

1178
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.083
I'm sorry.

1179
01:35:50.833 --> 01:35:52.125
I'm so sorry.

1180
01:35:58.458 --> 01:35:59.542
If you can hear me.

1181
01:36:00.708 --> 01:36:01.708
I was wrong.

1182
01:36:05.792 --> 01:36:07.083
Can you forgive me, please?

1183
01:36:08.833 --> 01:36:10.583
I promise I will make it right.

1184
01:36:14.583 --> 01:36:16.583
I wish I could be
with you again.

1185
01:36:28.417 --> 01:36:29.750
Goodbye, Mother.

1186
01:36:34.375 --> 01:36:35.417
I love you.

1187
01:36:58.833 --> 01:37:01.750
NOMAD has found us!

1188
01:37:02.250 --> 01:37:03.792
EVACUATE!

1189
01:37:13.167 --> 01:37:14.833
Your orders
are to hack everything

1190
01:37:14.917 --> 01:37:16.708
and find their remaining bases.

1191
01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:20.083
Take her down.

1192
01:37:48.667 --> 01:37:50.250
Come on, we gotta go.
We got...

1193
01:37:51.417 --> 01:37:52.417
Colonel?

1194
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
First the weapon,
then the Nirmata.

1195
01:37:56.083 --> 01:37:57.458
Thank you for your service.

1196
01:37:57.542 --> 01:37:59.917
Well, you're too late.
She's gone.

1197
01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:03.042
Not until I say so.

1198
01:38:07.292 --> 01:38:08.917
You playing God now?

1199
01:38:09.458 --> 01:38:10.726
You know,
you're lucky. I have orders

1200
01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:12.708
to take you and that thing back.

1201
01:38:12.792 --> 01:38:14.250
Stand down, Sergeant.

1202
01:38:15.167 --> 01:38:16.167
Back off.

1203
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:18.143
Let her rest, Colonel.
I told you she's dead, okay?

1204
01:38:18.167 --> 01:38:19.917
You are a selfish
son of a bitch, Taylor.

1205
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.167
I ought to put
a hole in you right now.

1206
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:24.500
But you hand that thing over
and nobody has to know.

1207
01:38:24.583 --> 01:38:25.875
You can go home a hero.

1208
01:38:25.958 --> 01:38:27.708
You lied about Maya bein' alive.

1209
01:38:27.792 --> 01:38:30.042
- You'd never let her go back.
- That's right.

1210
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.375
- Going in.
- Put it down.

1211
01:38:32.458 --> 01:38:34.250
- Put the gun down.
- Drop the weapon.

1212
01:38:35.167 --> 01:38:36.333
Now!

1213
01:38:39.833 --> 01:38:40.958
Put it down.

1214
01:38:46.625 --> 01:38:47.625
Don't.

1215
01:38:49.792 --> 01:38:50.792
No.

1216
01:39:08.458 --> 01:39:09.518
- Shit! Wait, what is that?
- Shit!

1217
01:39:09.542 --> 01:39:10.643
Get it off.
Come on! Get it off!

1218
01:39:10.667 --> 01:39:12.708
- God! Get it off!
- Yeah.

1219
01:39:12.792 --> 01:39:14.112
- Get the thing off me.
- Hold on.

1220
01:39:14.375 --> 01:39:15.375
Come on.

1221
01:39:19.583 --> 01:39:20.625
Weapons hot!

1222
01:39:20.833 --> 01:39:22.125
No, wait, wait, wait!

1223
01:39:35.917 --> 01:39:37.542
Get her out of here.

1224
01:39:38.458 --> 01:39:40.583
Destroy <i>Nomad,</i>

1225
01:39:42.375 --> 01:39:43.375
brother.

1226
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.458
Come on. Come on.

1227
01:40:06.625 --> 01:40:07.667
No, wait. Wait, no!

1228
01:40:09.083 --> 01:40:10.083
Freeze.

1229
01:40:10.625 --> 01:40:11.625
- Friendly.
- Hey!

1230
01:40:12.458 --> 01:40:13.542
Sergeant Taylor...

1231
01:40:13.625 --> 01:40:16.125
<i>Nomad's</i> about to fire.
We gotta go.

1232
01:40:16.208 --> 01:40:17.208
You're a hero, sir.

1233
01:40:17.292 --> 01:40:18.351
You did it!
You killed Nirmata.

1234
01:40:18.375 --> 01:40:20.625
You got the weapon.
We found the other bases.

1235
01:40:20.708 --> 01:40:21.708
Let's go! Let's go!

1236
01:40:39.125 --> 01:40:40.125
Hold! Hold!

1237
01:40:41.583 --> 01:40:42.625
It's okay.

1238
01:40:44.917 --> 01:40:45.917
Hey, hey, give her back.

1239
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.184
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1240
01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:48.917
- Stop! Wait, wait.
- Joshua!

1241
01:40:49.417 --> 01:40:50.500
- Joshua!
- Stop.

1242
01:40:50.583 --> 01:40:52.000
Sergeant, move.
Move, move, move!

1243
01:40:52.083 --> 01:40:53.583
- Joshua! Josh...
- Alphie!

1244
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:55.667
- Alphie.
- Joshua!

1245
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:58.208
Joshua! Joshua!

1246
01:41:01.292 --> 01:41:03.708
Hey, it's not real.

1247
01:41:03.792 --> 01:41:05.000
It's just programming.

1248
01:41:07.375 --> 01:41:08.500
It's not real.

1249
01:41:09.292 --> 01:41:10.292
It's just programming.

1250
01:41:11.375 --> 01:41:12.375
Alphie.

1251
01:41:49.333 --> 01:41:50.417
Nomad <i>Messenger.</i>

1252
01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:52.167
<i>Seven. Nine. Zero.</i>

1253
01:41:53.708 --> 01:41:55.667
We tried to terminate
the weapon cleanly,

1254
01:41:56.583 --> 01:41:57.708
but she won't let us.

1255
01:41:59.208 --> 01:42:00.208
She trusts you.

1256
01:42:02.375 --> 01:42:04.208
So, either you help us

1257
01:42:04.375 --> 01:42:06.917
or our other methods
will be unimaginably painful.

1258
01:42:09.375 --> 01:42:10.375
This is quick.

1259
01:42:11.208 --> 01:42:12.333
It's better this way.

1260
01:42:13.875 --> 01:42:15.292
Those tech boys will...

1261
01:42:57.375 --> 01:42:58.833
Am I going to heaven?

1262
01:43:11.542 --> 01:43:12.542
Listen to me...

1263
01:43:12.625 --> 01:43:13.958
What'd he say?

1264
01:43:14.042 --> 01:43:15.500
What's happening?

1265
01:43:15.583 --> 01:43:16.667
It's just interference.

1266
01:43:16.750 --> 01:43:18.375
The EMP device is charging.

1267
01:43:28.708 --> 01:43:29.708
Sir, it worked.

1268
01:43:30.083 --> 01:43:32.417
The weapon is neutralized.

1269
01:43:38.125 --> 01:43:39.750
What will they do with her?

1270
01:43:40.250 --> 01:43:41.292
Normally, it would be

1271
01:43:41.375 --> 01:43:43.375
taken up to <i>Nomad </i>for research.

1272
01:43:43.542 --> 01:43:45.208
But instead,
it'll be incinerated

1273
01:43:45.292 --> 01:43:46.667
at the Ground Zero facility.

1274
01:43:49.375 --> 01:43:51.750
I'd like to be there
for that. Please?

1275
01:43:53.375 --> 01:43:54.542
It's not a funeral.

1276
01:43:57.958 --> 01:43:59.958
It is to me, General.

1277
01:44:18.583 --> 01:44:20.792
{\an8}<i>Anti-Nomad
protesters are gathering</i>

1278
01:44:20.875 --> 01:44:22.625
{\an8}<i>throughout the world,
condemning today's</i>

1279
01:44:22.708 --> 01:44:24.625
<i>planned strike on A.I. bases.</i>

1280
01:44:26.125 --> 01:44:27.125
What is it?

1281
01:44:27.208 --> 01:44:28.292
<i>Sir, we've decoded</i>

1282
01:44:28.375 --> 01:44:29.792
<i>what Taylor said to the weapon.</i>

1283
01:44:30.208 --> 01:44:31.708
<i>Patching it through.</i>

1284
01:44:31.875 --> 01:44:34.583
<i>Not off. Standby.</i>

1285
01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.542
Shit. Stop that vehicle.

1286
01:44:38.625 --> 01:44:39.875
<i>Pull over! Now!</i>

1287
01:44:39.958 --> 01:44:41.000
<i>That's an order!</i>

1288
01:44:41.083 --> 01:44:42.434
- Stop the truck.
- Alphie, do it. Do it.

1289
01:44:42.458 --> 01:44:43.458
Oh, my God.

1290
01:44:43.542 --> 01:44:44.667
What the hell?

1291
01:45:02.625 --> 01:45:04.417
- Joshua.
- Come on, Alphie.

1292
01:45:06.417 --> 01:45:08.333
Tell forward units
to cut off that angle!

1293
01:45:08.417 --> 01:45:09.542
Secure!

1294
01:45:09.625 --> 01:45:10.665
- Move!
- Let's go. Go, go.

1295
01:45:10.708 --> 01:45:12.059
Containment,
get eyes on the other side!

1296
01:45:12.083 --> 01:45:14.792
Where's the weapon?
Where's the weapon?

1297
01:45:16.042 --> 01:45:17.042
Clear.

1298
01:45:17.125 --> 01:45:18.583
Surround the vehicle. Box 'em in!

1299
01:45:19.125 --> 01:45:20.458
Where did they go?

1300
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:33.750
<i>Next stop,</i>

1301
01:45:33.833 --> 01:45:35.083

1307
01:45:57.917 --> 01:45:58.917
Shit.

1308
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.917
What is the purpose
of your travel?

1309
01:46:02.042 --> 01:46:03.625
To be free.

1310
01:46:05.542 --> 01:46:06.708
Enjoy your flight.

1311
01:46:11.250 --> 01:46:12.893
Sir, they're trying
to board a Lunar shuttle.

1312
01:46:12.917 --> 01:46:13.958
Shoot to kill. Let's go.

1313
01:46:14.042 --> 01:46:15.542
Sir, we're blind.

1314
01:46:17.208 --> 01:46:18.250
Ground all flights.

1315
01:46:35.208 --> 01:46:36.750
<i>All personnel report</i>

{\an8}Yes, sir.

Ladies and gentlemen,
due to an emergency,

01:46:49.333 --> 01:46:51.500
the shuttle will be returning
to Los Angeles.

1323
01:46:51.583 --> 01:46:53.958
<i>Please stay calm

<i>- Please remain seated...
</i>- Okay.

1327
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:58.809
<i>And keep your seat belts</i>

<i>As we prepare for descent

1330
01:47:06.083 --> 01:47:07.333
One and three are down.

1331
01:47:07.417 --> 01:47:08.875
- You got nav?
- Negative.

1332
01:47:13.792 --> 01:47:14.792
What's going on?

1333
01:47:14.875 --> 01:47:16.792
Sir, we've lost contact
with Flight OX-1.

1334
01:47:16.875 --> 01:47:17.917
It changed course.

1335
01:47:30.250 --> 01:47:32.000
Do not let that thing
get aboard <i>Nomad.</i>

1336
01:47:32.333 --> 01:47:33.333
Sir.

1337
01:47:49.333 --> 01:47:51.625

- Ladies and gentlemen,

01:47:54.083 --> 01:47:55.283
<i>At a military installation.</i>

01:48:01.250 --> 01:48:03.083
<i>We ask you to evacuate calmly</i>

<i>Alpha team moving in.</i>

<i>Let's do it, do it,
do it. Push up, push up.</i>

1352
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.583
<i>Pushing toward the cockpit.</i>

1353
01:48:33.667 --> 01:48:34.708
<i>No sign of him.</i>

<i>Cabin's clear.</i>

<i>Alphie! Alphie, hang on!</i>

1361
01:48:54.333 --> 01:48:55.333
<i>Hold on, hold on!</i>

1362
01:48:56.083 --> 01:48:57.125
<i>I can't, I can't!</i>

1363
01:48:57.208 --> 01:48:58.708
<i>No!</i>

1364
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.375
Open the airlock!

1365
01:49:10.083 --> 01:49:11.583
<i>Hit the button!</i>

1366
01:49:13.792 --> 01:49:16.375
Hit the button,
please. Hit the button.

1367
01:49:28.333 --> 01:49:30.042
Sir, Taylor's
arming an explosive.

1368
01:49:30.125 --> 01:49:31.417
They're gonna take out <i>Nomad.</i>

1369
01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:33.625
Bring forward the attack.

1370
01:49:33.708 --> 01:49:35.250
Launch on all A.I. bases.

1371
01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:48.625
<i>Shit. They're
launching the missiles.</i>

1372
01:50:01.083 --> 01:50:03.250
<i>Alphie. All right.</i>

1373
01:50:04.417 --> 01:50:06.000
<i>All right, listen. Here.</i>

1374
01:50:06.875 --> 01:50:08.075
<i>I'll be with you on the radio.</i>

1375
01:50:09.125 --> 01:50:11.059
<i>You've got to stop them
from launching the missiles.</i>

1376
01:50:11.083 --> 01:50:13.500
<i>You go turn the power off,
so I could blow this place up.</i>

1377
01:50:14.833 --> 01:50:17.000
<i>Mother...
this is what she wanted.</i>

1378
01:50:20.208 --> 01:50:21.625
<i>Do it for her.</i>

1379
01:50:21.833 --> 01:50:22.917
<i>Do it for Mother.</i>

1380
01:50:23.458 --> 01:50:24.583
<i>Go to the control room</i>

1381
01:50:24.667 --> 01:50:27.042
<i>and shut down the power.
I'll meet you back here.</i>

1382
01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:31.125
<i>Go. Go.</i>

1383
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.250
It's gone inside.

1384
01:50:41.708 --> 01:50:43.250
The weapon's inside <i>Nomad.</i>

1385
01:50:44.042 --> 01:50:45.917
Seal it off and destroy it.

1386
01:50:46.083 --> 01:50:47.375
- Yes, sir.
- Wait.

1387
01:50:48.333 --> 01:50:49.375
Where's Taylor?

1388
01:50:49.458 --> 01:50:52.750
<i>Okay. Don't fall, Joshua.
Don't fall.</i>

1389
01:50:57.333 --> 01:50:58.601
- Move, move, move.
- Take the shot.

1390
01:50:58.625 --> 01:50:59.625
Cover me.

1391
01:50:59.708 --> 01:51:00.708
Move!

1392
01:51:02.833 --> 01:51:04.458
<i>Control room located.</i>

<i>please report

<i>All personnel, please report
to the evacuation point.</i>

1396
01:51:19.333 --> 01:51:20.458
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

1397
01:51:31.208 --> 01:51:33.000
Sir, Taylor's
going for a missile.

1398
01:51:33.208 --> 01:51:34.292
Launch the attack.

1399
01:51:34.333 --> 01:51:35.875
Yes, sir.

1400
01:51:44.833 --> 01:51:46.458
<i>Alphie, we gotta stop them.</i>

1401
01:51:46.542 --> 01:51:48.375
<i>Get to the control room. Now!</i>

1402
01:51:54.917 --> 01:51:56.833
<i>Missiles approaching targets.</i>

1403
01:52:06.667 --> 01:52:07.851
<i>Alphie, you gotta turn it off.</i>

1404
01:52:07.875 --> 01:52:08.958
<i>Hurry!</i>

1405
01:52:10.875 --> 01:52:12.625
<i>Alphie, now!</i>

1406
01:52:39.208 --> 01:52:41.083
Launch system's lost power, sir.

1407
01:52:52.042 --> 01:52:55.083
<i>10 minutes.</i>

1408
01:52:56.292 --> 01:52:58.500
<i>Alphie, great job.
We got 10 minutes.</i>

1409
01:52:58.583 --> 01:52:59.851
<i>Get back
to the shuttle right now.</i>

1410
01:52:59.875 --> 01:53:00.958
<i>Go, Go!</i>

1411
01:53:06.583 --> 01:53:07.583
Power's back on.

1412
01:53:08.875 --> 01:53:10.500
Shit, the launch system's dead.

1413
01:53:36.583 --> 01:53:38.125
<i>Oxygen level low.</i>

1414
01:53:38.208 --> 01:53:39.250

<i>We gotta go.</i>

Mother?

1418
01:54:05.833 --> 01:54:06.833
<i>Alphie?</i>

1419
01:54:08.125 --> 01:54:09.125
<i>Alphie?</i>

1420
01:54:09.208 --> 01:54:10.500
<i>Five minutes.</i>

1421
01:54:11.375 --> 01:54:12.417
<i>Damn it.</i>

<i>I can't breathe.</i>

1428
01:54:48.167 --> 01:54:49.500
Come on, come on, come on.

1429
01:54:49.583 --> 01:54:50.875
Joshua needs us.

1430
01:54:50.958 --> 01:54:52.083
<i>Can't breathe.</i>

1431
01:55:13.792 --> 01:55:15.792
<i>Missiles

1432

They're trying to escape.

1443
01:56:36.375 --> 01:56:37.417
Get me a remote unit.

1444
01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:38.500
Got access.

1445
01:56:39.333 --> 01:56:40.333
What's the command?

Kill the bastards.

No, no, no.
