[police radio chatter]

3
00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.762
That wasn't a store robbery.

4
00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:56.806
That was an assassination.

5
00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.434
That wasn't a clerk. That was a wise guy.

6
00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:01.978
How do I know?

7
00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:07.150
I spent a little time
with the FBI's organized crime unit.

8
00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:10.028
I guess you could say
that I'm intimately knowledgeable

9
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:12.030
with the seedy
and rancorous workings of the mob

10
00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:13.907
in the Midwest section of this country.

11
00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:18.369
I know a gangland slaying when I see one,
and that's exactly what this baby is.

12
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.873
I'd look into it myself personally,
but I got a date tonight.

13
00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:26.211
I think I'll take the private jet out
and fly to Spain,

14
00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.004
pick up the little lady,

15
00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:30.465
do the subsonic tummy bump at 30,000 feet,

16
00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:33.051
then glide back into the US of A by dawn.

17
00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:38.431
I know what you're gonna say,
"Jim. Jim Dodge, settle down.

18
00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.683
Relax. You owe it
to yourself." [chuckling]

19
00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:42.977
I'll tell you what I tell everybody else.

20
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:46.648
Any little <i>Fräulein</i>
that expects anything more from me

21
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.067
than a little bit of pleasure and danger

22
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.777
and a great set of pectorals,

23
00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:52.737
she's looking for a fall right on her ass.

24

[Jim] Hubie, Hubie, Hubie, Hubie!

27
00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:01.454
Get out of here!
Let me tell you something.

28
00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:04.207
If you know what's good for you,
don't you ever come back!

29
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.376
Wait a minute, now, Hubie.

30
00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.461
You won't find someone
who has the relationship

31
00:02:08.544 --> 00:02:10.380
with those animals that I do.

32
00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.423
-[barking continues]
-Listen to the dogs, Hubie.

33
00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:13.424
They love me!

34
00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.262
It all started when I was 15.

35
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.682
That's when I invented
the artificial cow heart.

36
00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:22.892
Oh, that was a big thing.

37
00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:27.230
A little before your time,
but it made all the newspapers.

38
00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:30.066
ABC, NBC, CBS, they all picked up on it.

39
00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:33.069
But it's more or less
a hobby for me, boys.

40
00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:35.738
[boy] Scoot over!

41
00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.783
[groans] Actually,

42
00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:43.788
today I decided that I've gone
just about as far I can go

43
00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.874
in the animal health-care business.

44
00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:49.460
But to answer your question, the reason
that I'm not at work this afternoon,

45
00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:52.463
is because I was made an offer
that I simply cannot refuse.

46
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:53.923
I sold.

47
00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:55.800
Whatcha gonna do with the cash, Jim?

48
00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.844
I don't know. Maybe invest it overseas.

49
00:02:57.927 --> 00:02:59.762
I've got some projects
in eastern Europe now.

50
00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.556
I dunno. I've got everything a man needs.

51
00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:04.684
Jim, you just bought the animal hospital.

52
00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:06.811
How come you sold it so fast?

53
00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.273
Tax problem.

54
00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.192
And here's my accountant right now.

55
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.279
Earl, take a bow. [laughs]

56
00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:19.449
Take 20 minutes for lunch, Earl, okay?
Go buy another suit.

57
00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.409
[laughs] He works for me.

58
00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:23.995
He's scouting
some real estate for me right now.

59
00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:25.788
Yeah, but the market's real tight.

60
00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.419
I like the new uniform, Lorraine.

61
00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:36.466
You know,
with the right shoes and handbag,

62
00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.676
that might be suitable
for a cocktail party.

63
00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:41.346
So… question.

64
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.515
When in the world are you going
to start serving sashimi?

65
00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.268
Maybe when I find out what it is.

66
00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.439
[chuckles] You've never heard of sashimi?

67
00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:53.274
You've got to be kidding.

68
00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:57.320
It's this special Japanese fish
you eat raw.

69
00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.197
With a little butter sauce,

70
00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:00.990
and you're ready to go to heaven.

71
00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:06.663
I'd hire you in a minute if I hadn't
already fired you so many times.

72
00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:09.666
Did you ever think of leaving town?

73
00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.254
Thousands of people over in St. Louis

74
00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.714
got no idea how full of shit you are.

75
00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:22.971
You've been alive for 21 years, my friend.

76
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:27.433
Plenty of time for most people
to find a place for themselves.

77
00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.144
Well…

78
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.939
I'm not like everybody else.

79
00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:36.109
-You know what I'm saying? [chuckles]
-Yeah, that's for sure.

80
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.196
How about if I…

81
00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.532
I work for you for free?

82
00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:44.867
[bell rings]

83
00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.661
No.

84
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.122
I'm afraid not, Jimmy.

85

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.296
You got fired again, didn't you?

91
00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.630
-Yeah.
-Didn't you?

92
00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.799
[spluttering] Who told you that?

93
00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.718
Hubie Marshall called me at work.

94
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.220
He called you at work?

95
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:47.889
That's… That's it. Okay.

96
00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:49.766
I'm gonna… I'll speak… What'd he say?

97
00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:51.601
He said he fired ya!

98
00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.438
He said that? And you believed him?

99
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.939
Damn straight, I do!

100
00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:59.859
All due respect, Dad,
you're Mr. Gullible, sometimes.

101
00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.363
The truth of the matter is,
Dad, I resigned.

102
00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.908
I'll tell you something else, Dad.

103
00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.868
-Shut up, Jimmy!
-When I took the job,

104
00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:11.954
I had no idea it was
gonna be a hire-fire situation.

105
00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.541
Luther Betenhauser's boy is
doing much better.

106
00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.919
-What's wrong with him?
-Fell off his grandfather's silo.

107
00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:19.045
He's got brain damage.

108
00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:20.546
He does not.

109
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.758
He does, too. Hoover Fey says
his tongue's gonna hang out

110
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:25.843
of the side of his mouth
the rest of his life.

111
00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.428
And when he dies and they bury him,

112
00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.639
at the funeral they're gonna
put a mask on him.

113
00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:32.141
Do I have to listen
to this while I'm eating?

114

Let's talk about something else.

115
00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:42.110
Josie McClellan moved to New York.

116
00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.612
She did not. I just saw her today.

117
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.240
Well, I don't know how you could.

118
00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:50.618
I heard at the bank that she got tired
of taking care of her father,

119
00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:52.120
and she told him to jump in a lake,

120
00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:55.289
and then she left for New York
to get her MBA in high-fashion design

121
00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.166
at the University of New York City.

122
00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:01.629
I just saw her down
at the gas station in living color.

127
00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.894
you sure are handy with the tongue sword.

128
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.438
You got canned again?

129
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.107
Well, he didn't get… canned.

130
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.151
He got fired.

131
00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:26.404

-You did pay rent.

Dad, you mean you're cutting my rent?

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.305
Hell, no!

141
00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:56.184
You're not paying a rent 'cause you don't
have a job or any money.

00:10:02.351 --> 00:10:04.061
They're very good, they're fresh.

175
00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.565
-No, I'm fine.
-You don't want one, and I don't need one.

176
00:10:07.648 --> 00:10:09.525
-[laughing]
-Right!

177
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.861
Love the darn things, though,
I tell you. You know,

178
00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.697
I got a sweet tooth, I could eat
those things by the dozen.

179
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.574
By the looks of it, I have. [laughs]

180
00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:17.867
Right.

181
00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.828
I tell ya, I'm so excited that you're

182
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:24.206
considering joining the Target team.
We all are.

183
00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:27.043
I appreciate that.

184
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:30.630
Good. Then, let's cut
right to the chase, shall we?

185
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:35.384
We're prepared
to offer you forty-two five a year,

186
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:37.553
with a full benefit package.

187
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.306
That's dental, medical,

188
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:41.974
profit sharing, pension,

189
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:45.227
expense account, car allowance,

190
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.104
vacation, of course,

191
00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:50.608
and any and all relocating expenses.

192
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:53.361
This is our first, best, and last offer.

193
00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:55.363
What do you think?

194
00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:57.573
Well… [clears throat]

195
00:10:58.032 --> 00:10:59.992
CD, with all due respect,

196
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.536
I came in here

197
00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:05.581
with the number 45 in my mind, and…

198
00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:15.883
[exhales]

199
00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:24.809
Hmm.

200
00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:30.272
[chuckling] You've got me.

201
00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:32.817
Forty-five it is.

202
00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:37.071
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

203
00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:38.406
I'd like to buy you lunch.

204
00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:40.574
No, no, no. Your money's no good here.

205
00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:41.867
Lunch is mine, all right?

206
00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.912
-I'm not going to argue with you.
-You better not. I'm bigger than you are.

207
00:11:44.995 --> 00:11:46.288
[intercom buzzing]

208
00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:48.582
Hang on a second?
I told her to hold my calls.

209
00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:51.168
-Get it.
-Yeah, Peg. Uh-huh.

210
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.672
[chuckling] No, it's okay.

211
00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:56.799
-No, he's right here with me now.
-Hi, Peg.

212
00:11:58.008 --> 00:12:00.511
Yeah, we just closed the deal. Uh-huh.

213
00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:04.723
Oh, it was a slam-dunk, too.
I got him for 45.

214
00:12:09.937 --> 00:12:11.480
No, he's right here.

215
00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:14.984
What do you mean, he missed the plane?

216
00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.281
Then who the hell am I talking to?

217
00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:24.577
[sighs] Oh, Lord!

218
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.663
I'll…

219
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:29.707
I'll get back to you.

220
00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:32.918
Hey, I know a great little Italian place

221
00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:35.713
that has the best pasta primatonis in the…

222
00:12:35.796 --> 00:12:37.298
Excuse me a minute, will you, please?

223
00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:40.384
-Lovely wife you have there.
-Dodge, James?

224
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.344
Mm-hmm.

225
00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.055
[sighs]

226
00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:47.933
James, I'm afraid we have
a little misunderstanding here.

227
00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:50.436
You see, I thought you came in for the…

228
00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:52.771
Operations Manager's job.

229
00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:56.734
I have you down here as night cleanup boy.

230
00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.697
Well, I'm a little overpaid

231
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.408
for night cleanup boy,
wouldn't you say, CD?

232
00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:10.331
The truth is, James,
I can offer you $4.44 per hour.

233
00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:16.962
Uh, four, four… $4.44…

234
00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:18.631
$4.44.

235
00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:20.466
What about the benefits?

236
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:22.927
Two fifteen-minute breaks
and a half hour for lunch.

237
00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:28.140
And the title is night… cleanup boy?

238
00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:30.184
Yes.

239
00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:33.812
I'll take it.

240
00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.191
Oh, and, uh, lose the curl.

241
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.277
-Welcome to the Target team.
-Thank you.

242
00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:45.157
[Bosenbeck] So the parrot says,
"Of course, I can talk. Can you fly?"

[all laughing]

244
00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:53.749
I don't want any damn
Japanese automobile plant in this town.

245
00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.546
It… it means jobs.

246
00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:01.131
I don't need a job.

247
00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:04.468
Your governor's trying to use
my town as a political chip.

248
00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.095
Gentlemen, I resent that.

249
00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:10.015
Well, there could be
some specific benefits for you personally.

250
00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:15.854
[Roger] Josie!

251
00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.776
-Yeah?
-Come here.

252
00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:23.988
I want you to meet these gentlemen
from the governor's office.

253
00:14:25.447 --> 00:14:26.907
Come on in here, honey.

254
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.214
[clears throat]

00:14:44.174 --> 00:14:46.719
-Honey, I want you to meet Bill, uh…
-[Bosenbeck] Uh, Bob.

256
00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:49.346
Bob Bosenbeck.

257
00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:53.934

My pleasure, Dave.

261
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:20.336
Right. Dave Hockner. [clears throat]

262
00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:23.756
I don't want to interrupt your meeting.

263
00:15:24.673 --> 00:15:26.300
Very nice to meet both of you.

264
00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:28.302
Bye.

265
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.304
[Hockner] Bye.

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:36.685

You pull another stunt like you did today,

I'll beat the living daylights outta you!

281
00:16:45.212 --> 00:16:46.088
Right on time.

282
00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:51.176
Everything's going as planned.

283
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.762
You ordered a limousine?

284
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:57.474
Of course. [chuckles]

285
00:16:58.392 --> 00:16:59.601
My first day at work.

286
00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:02.021
How's it gonna look if my dad drives me?

287
00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:04.772
A little treat to myself
for getting the job.

288
00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.525
It was only 50 bucks.

289
00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:09.194
[Jim whistling]

290
00:17:09.444 --> 00:17:10.654

291
00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:12.156
Yes, sir.

292
00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:13.781
Henry, the sign.

293
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:15.992
-Very well, sir.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

Hey, Jim, where are you going?

296
00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:32.384
Hello, boys.

297
00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:35.763
Going to Paris on an F-14.

298
00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:38.682
Got a little peace meeting
with the Vice-President of Bulgaria.

299
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:41.560
Business, you know?
Then I'm going to Venice,

300
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.188
for a big spaghetti dinner
with the princess of Austria.

301
00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:47.107
Beautiful lady. Really big bones.

302
00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:49.485
Remember to brush your teeth, Melvin!

00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:32.849
Boyfriends?

515
00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:36.352
Would you just get in the car
so we can go look for the girl, please?

516
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.063
I'm tired, I had to get out of the bed,

517
00:31:39.188 --> 00:31:41.065
I haven't had any coffee.
I don't feel good.

518
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:42.442
I dunno where my daughter is.

519
00:31:42.525 --> 00:31:44.068
And you're standing by the car there,

520
00:31:44.152 --> 00:31:46.029
sounding like some goddamn preacher!

521
00:31:46.112 --> 00:31:47.363
Come on. Get in the car!

522
00:31:49.449 --> 00:31:50.658
Prick.

523
00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.206
Are you sure you didn't hurt yourself?

524
00:31:57.916 --> 00:32:00.418
Oh, no. Are you kidding?

525
00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:02.462
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

526
00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:04.464
Can I ask what you were doing?

527
00:32:04.547 --> 00:32:06.466
Uh… Oh, I was roller-skating.

528
00:32:07.467 --> 00:32:09.052
I know, but why?

529
00:32:09.677 --> 00:32:10.762
Oh, why not?

530
00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.388
I got bored.

531
00:32:13.139 --> 00:32:16.392
One thing led to another
and I'm roller-skating in my shorts.

532
00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:20.438
A better question would be,
"What are you doing here?"

533
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:21.814
Shopping.

534
00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:25.068
Well, we've been closed for five hours.

535
00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:26.861
Yeah. I fell asleep.

536
00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:28.613
While shopping?

537
00:32:28.905 --> 00:32:30.323
No, in the ladies' dressing room.

538
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.035
That makes no sense.
You're a high-profile young ingénue.

539
00:32:34.243 --> 00:32:35.954
-I was debating.
-What?

540
00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:38.206
Whether or not
to get arrested for shoplifting.

541
00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:42.460
Doesn't your father own $10 million
worth of real estate in this town?

542
00:32:42.543 --> 00:32:43.711
Well, it's not my fault.

543
00:32:44.337 --> 00:32:46.047
No, no, I didn't imply such.

544
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:49.342
It just seems funny that someone of your…

545
00:32:49.425 --> 00:32:50.259
Wealth?

546
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.261
If you will, would be shoplifting.

547
00:32:53.012 --> 00:32:55.181
I didn't do it. I chickened out.

548
00:32:56.265 --> 00:32:57.892
Would consider shoplifting.

549
00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:02.480
It's a long, dull, self-indulgent,
highly unromantic story

550
00:33:02.563 --> 00:33:04.774
about an overbearing father,

551
00:33:05.274 --> 00:33:09.278
deceased mother and brother
and… a completely confused girl

552
00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:10.863
who looks a little like me.

553
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.586
[sighs]

554
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.737
I sure am glad you dropped by.

555
00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:54.157
I was getting pretty tired
of being with myself.

556
00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:01.414
I guess… I guess
I'm what you call a people person.

557
00:34:04.417 --> 00:34:06.794
-What are you cooking?
-Hobo Chicken.

558
00:34:06.961 --> 00:34:09.255
It's a glazed chicken in wine sauce

559
00:34:09.338 --> 00:34:11.549
with vegetables and skin-on potatoes.

560
00:34:12.341 --> 00:34:13.967
Silverware… silverware.

561
00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:19.556
It's only 210 calories.

562
00:34:19.681 --> 00:34:22.726
And I don't know if you're watching
your figure, but I sure am.

563
00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:27.648
Uh, if you could just grab a serving spoon
over there, I think we'll be set.

564
00:34:33.987 --> 00:34:35.656
Uh, keep your distance from these things.

565
00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:37.699
I think it's safe to keep five feet.

566
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:39.534
[bell dings]

567
00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:44.581
I think they're about done.

568
00:34:47.543 --> 00:34:49.504
Well, dining room's right this way.

569
00:34:52.547 --> 00:34:53.716
Mm!

570
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.135
Mm. Oh.

571
00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.389
I think my father poured
the cement for your pool.

572
00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:03.643
He's a cement contractor.

573
00:35:04.477 --> 00:35:05.478
Good man.

574
00:35:06.395 --> 00:35:07.647
Bud Dodge?

575
00:35:07.855 --> 00:35:10.316
My mother works at Hoenicker's
over Christmas, part time.

576
00:35:10.691 --> 00:35:12.318
My sister's a teller at the bank.

577
00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:15.113
My brother's in grade school.
He's not employed at the moment.

578
00:35:15.363 --> 00:35:17.573
I used to work at the animal shelter.

579
00:35:18.241 --> 00:35:21.536
But I was terminated.
And… now I'm working here.

580
00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:25.498
Do you always talk this much?

581
00:35:28.334 --> 00:35:29.752
Yeah, I guess I do.

582
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.672
I like talking to people.

583
00:35:35.007 --> 00:35:37.051
I was thinking
maybe you should go into sales.

584
00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:38.427
I've actually tried that.

585
00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:47.395
Some fresh ground pepper?

586
00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:49.647
Please.

587
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.026
Some people don't like a lot of pepper.

588
00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:55.528
-Say when.
-That's fine.

589
00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:58.698
I happen to really like it a lot.

590
00:35:58.781 --> 00:36:01.284
I think it enhances
the natural flavor of the chicken.

591
00:36:06.205 --> 00:36:08.040
I hope you don't take this the wrong way.

592
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.252
I've had dreams about you.

593
00:36:11.961 --> 00:36:13.588
You've had dreams about me?

594
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.674
Well, not recently.

595
00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:18.926
I've had dreams about you in the past.

596
00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:21.512
I've had dreams
about entire cheerleading squads,

597
00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:23.139
so don't get me wrong.

598
00:36:23.723 --> 00:36:25.558
It's kid stuff, you know. How about you?

599
00:36:26.225 --> 00:36:27.351
-Do I dream?
-Mm.

600
00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:31.230
That's about all I do.

601
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.164
[Roger] Raisin' a kid's hard work.
You got any kids?

602
00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.959
[officer] No, sir. No, sir.
And from listening to you talking

603
00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:53.794
and from observing this, I…

604
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:57.465
I'm kinda grateful
old Emily turned up infertile.

605
00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:16.484
Shouldn't you be cleaning up the store?

606
00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:19.445
I got plenty of time.

607
00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:22.323
-Big store.
-Huge.

608
00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:25.409
Always smoke cigars?

609
00:37:27.245 --> 00:37:29.163
I enjoy a good one after a fine meal.

610
00:37:29.538 --> 00:37:30.831
It settles the stomach.

611
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.210
You're the town liar, right?

612
00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:41.133
-What?
-I'm sorry.

613
00:37:41.217 --> 00:37:43.636
That really came out wrong.

614
00:37:44.262 --> 00:37:46.013
I don't see how that could come out right.

615
00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:47.682
I guess I meant people call you that.

616
00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:48.891
I didn't imply it's true.

617
00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:49.934
People call me that?

618
00:37:50.184 --> 00:37:51.018
I thought you knew.

619
00:37:51.477 --> 00:37:53.980
-Know what? That I was the town liar?
-You didn't?

620
00:37:54.563 --> 00:37:55.564
No. I'm not.

621
00:37:55.648 --> 00:37:57.275
You might have the wrong information.

622
00:37:57.358 --> 00:37:58.567
I didn't mean to offend you.

623
00:37:59.735 --> 00:38:01.112
You think that was a compliment?

624
00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:03.239
No. No. And I apologize.

625
00:38:03.364 --> 00:38:05.992
You know, I can't repeat things like that.

626
00:38:06.075 --> 00:38:08.619
Don't think about it. It's all right.

627
00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.871
As I said, you've got
the wrong information.

628
00:38:11.247 --> 00:38:12.790
But, if people are calling me that,

629
00:38:12.873 --> 00:38:15.835
[hesitates] it's only because they're
small, cheap, petty, and jealous.

630
00:38:15.918 --> 00:38:17.128
Small towns are notorious

631
00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:18.587
-for that kinda thing.
-Oh, yeah.

632
00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:20.756
-I'm sure there's a word for me.
-Sure.

633
00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.384
-What do they call me?
-A tease.

634
00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:24.802
Tease?

635
00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:29.140
Yeah, I can see that.

636
00:38:29.265 --> 00:38:30.266
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

637
00:38:30.725 --> 00:38:33.060
Actually, I never teased.

638
00:38:33.436 --> 00:38:35.313
This is becoming amusing.

639
00:38:35.396 --> 00:38:37.815
Who exactly calls me a liar?

640
00:38:38.774 --> 00:38:40.026
-Everybody.
-Everybody.

641
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:42.278
No, not everybody.
I'm sure there's some old people

642
00:38:42.403 --> 00:38:43.696
-in town.
-Right.

643
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:51.370
What do you think?

644
00:38:51.704 --> 00:38:53.456
Wh… what do I think?

645
00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:57.251
Do you think I'm a liar?

646
00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.337
Well, I don't know you well enough.

647
00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:03.215
You've known me for almost 17 years.

648
00:39:03.299 --> 00:39:05.509
We went to the same schools
from kindergarten on up.

649
00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:08.387
I knew of you,
but I didn't know you personally.

650
00:39:09.889 --> 00:39:11.223
That's always bothered me.

651
00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:15.394
I mean, that old "in-out, us-them" thing.

652
00:39:15.478 --> 00:39:16.479
The way it's always been.

653
00:39:16.562 --> 00:39:18.189
I know. It's always bothered me.

654
00:39:18.272 --> 00:39:20.608
Sure, but it's water over the dam now.

655
00:39:20.816 --> 00:39:23.569
[sighs] Yeah, but it's your dam
and my water.

656
00:39:24.153 --> 00:39:25.696
I got crapped on a lot of years.

657
00:39:25.821 --> 00:39:27.782
I just meant that it's in the past.

658
00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:30.659
Well, the present is a result of the past.

659
00:39:30.993 --> 00:39:32.578
I look at my high-school yearbook,

660
00:39:32.661 --> 00:39:35.414
and I don't see four fabulous years.

661
00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:38.584
Actually, what I'm reminded of
is what it feels like

662
00:39:38.667 --> 00:39:40.628
to have my underwear yanked up my ass

663
00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:42.963
by a football player
with arms like telephone poles.

664
00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:45.341
Okay, and where are those guys now?

665
00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:50.054
I know they're not working nights
at Target. I'll tell you that.

666
00:39:51.847 --> 00:39:53.766
Yeah. You know,

667
00:39:54.517 --> 00:39:56.143
I look at my yearbook

668
00:39:56.602 --> 00:39:59.855
and I see four fabulous years

669
00:40:01.357 --> 00:40:03.150
that are gonna be
the highlight of my life.

670
00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:04.485
Here's what it's like.

671
00:40:05.444 --> 00:40:08.447
First, you feel a hand going down
the back of your pants

672
00:40:08.781 --> 00:40:10.491
and tighten around the elastic waistband--

673
00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:11.909
Highlight.

674
00:40:11.992 --> 00:40:13.494
Sometimes I'd actually see stars.

675
00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:15.204
It's not going to get any better.

676
00:40:15.704 --> 00:40:17.164
And if I was particularly unlucky,

677
00:40:17.498 --> 00:40:20.418
my shorts would, like rip completely free

678
00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:23.212
-and I would get this really drastic--
-Jim, do you hear me?

679
00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:27.133
Yeah.

680
00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:32.513
I don't care about a graphic description

681
00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:33.514
of a childhood prank.

682
00:40:34.557 --> 00:40:36.517
Hey, that prank was a motif in my life.

683
00:40:41.313 --> 00:40:44.024
You know, I'm… locked in this store here

684
00:40:44.984 --> 00:40:47.611
because I didn't have
the guts to steal a skirt,

685
00:40:47.903 --> 00:40:50.614
so I could get arrested
and embarrass my father

686
00:40:50.698 --> 00:40:53.159
in this stupid, desperate, childish,

687
00:40:53.242 --> 00:40:54.910
pathetic attempt to leave home.

688
00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:57.997
[smirks] And you have
your underwear yanked up your ass.

689
00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.874
I have my entire life yanked up
my ass.

690
00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:04.920
Well, you're speaking figuratively.

691
00:41:05.004 --> 00:41:06.881
-I was speaking literally.
-And you're happy.

692
00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:08.257
You know, you're happy.

693
00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:10.634
I'm not happy.

694
00:41:11.177 --> 00:41:14.930
I'm working nights.
Uh, everybody thinks I'm a liar.

695
00:41:15.389 --> 00:41:16.932
My whole family's laughing at me.

696
00:41:17.016 --> 00:41:19.185
Reverend Harwell gave me
the finger last week.

697
00:41:19.268 --> 00:41:21.896
You're not happy,
but you have some control over your life.

698
00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:24.273
-So do you.
-My father controls my life.

699
00:41:25.191 --> 00:41:28.360
You're over 18. You can tell him
to drop dead, and get on a plane.

700
00:41:28.444 --> 00:41:31.071
-So can you.
-I don't want to.

701
00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:35.451
-I like living at home.
-No, you don't.

702
00:41:35.534 --> 00:41:38.787
What am I, a garden snail?

703
00:41:39.955 --> 00:41:41.582
An involuntary muscle in a janitor suit?

704
00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:43.501
I, uh, I know what I want to do.

705
00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:47.838
What could you possibly like
about living at home at your age?

706
00:41:48.714 --> 00:41:52.801
The meals are great. I mean,
there's the, uh… There's cable.

707
00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:57.097
Um, the accommodations
are excellent, five-star.

708
00:41:57.223 --> 00:41:59.099
What do you care if I'm
living at home or not?

709
00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:03.229
Hey, I didn't come here to irritate you.

710
00:42:03.312 --> 00:42:04.980
Well, you're beginning to.

711
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.361
[sighs] Great. That's really great.

712
00:42:11.445 --> 00:42:13.656
I gotta stop saying those kinds of things.

713
00:42:14.448 --> 00:42:16.909
Those freakin' kids!
I knew I couldn't trust 'em.

714
00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:19.870
Town liar. That's a nice rep. Nice rep.

715
00:42:20.246 --> 00:42:21.997
I bet it was Gregory, that little weasel.

716
00:42:22.081 --> 00:42:25.501
Top secret, top secret, I tell 'em,
and they still shoot off their mouths!

717
00:42:25.584 --> 00:42:27.211
If I'd really been a French spy…

718
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.089
those little tots
would've gotten me killed!

719

Piano wire wrapped around my neck.

720
00:42:32.132 --> 00:42:35.427
My testicles shoved down my throat,
a piece of dynamite stuck up my ass.

[chuckles] Let's analyze that remark.

758
00:45:39.445 --> 00:45:42.990
First, I don't have a dog,
my brother's not named Billy,

759
00:45:43.115 --> 00:45:45.159
and I don't even have a rumpus room.

760

-So I don't even--
-[Josie] You know what I mean.

You said something that wasn't true.

No.

766
00:46:12.644 --> 00:46:15.439
No, I said that I can have…

767
00:46:16.356 --> 00:46:18.400
sex when I want to, and I do. I do.

768
00:46:19.985 --> 00:46:22.946
However, I was looking forward to a nice,
quiet evening of janitoring.

769
00:46:25.574 --> 00:46:27.701
I don't think you see what I'm getting at.

770
00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:29.578
I see what you're getting at.

771
00:46:30.204 --> 00:46:33.832
I'm a lying monk with an Oedipus complex
and an appetite for home cooking.

772
00:46:33.916 --> 00:46:35.751
You're the indecisive shoplifter.

773
00:46:35.876 --> 00:46:39.630
Yes! Exactly! I would do
anything to be in your shoes.

774
00:46:40.547 --> 00:46:41.840
These are Darnell's shoes.

775

You know, you have freedom,
and you're not using it.

776
00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:48.263
It makes me sad.

777
00:46:49.056 --> 00:46:51.433
Well, you have the collective wealth
of the entire town,

778
00:46:51.517 --> 00:46:54.144
and you're trying to get yourself
arrested. That makes me sad.

00:46:54.228 --> 00:46:55.521
That makes me sad, too.

-That's pretty stupid.
-It's very stupid.

Are you serious?

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:05.781

This isn't the bottle talking?

No.

784
00:47:09.243 --> 00:47:12.079
Then why don't you just talk to the guy?

785
00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:16.250
For the same reason
that you can't leave home…

786
00:47:17.042 --> 00:47:18.919
I can't tell my father to go to hell.

00:47:20.462 --> 00:47:21.463
Why not?

788
00:47:24.591 --> 00:47:27.719
Because… I don't want to be alone.

-Where?
-Florida?

796
00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:22.190
Wyoming? Spain?

00:48:23.025 --> 00:48:25.527
It doesn't really matter,
just away somewhere.

798

I'd love to.

00:48:28.947 --> 00:48:30.657

-It's an end.

Maybe if you had, like,
a destination in mind,

805
00:48:49.343 --> 00:48:51.637
that would make all
the difference in the world.

806

Why?

807
00:48:55.015 --> 00:48:57.017
Well, uh, I'm, uh, I'm just not

Well…

811
00:49:05.525 --> 00:49:07.444
I was thinking about Los Angeles.

Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

813
00:49:10.989 --> 00:49:13.283
-What for?
-Live. Work.

814
00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:16.244
-At what?
-Whatever.

815
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:19.373
And what about your father?

816
00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:25.420
When I don't die, he'll realize
that I can make it on my own.

817
00:49:26.213 --> 00:49:29.549
If I do, he'll have the satisfaction
of knowing that I can't. [chuckles]

818
00:49:30.384 --> 00:49:33.595
If I run and he brings me back,
or if I go back on my own,

819
00:49:33.679 --> 00:49:35.305
he's gonna beat the shit out of me.

820
00:49:35.389 --> 00:49:38.642
-So it doesn't really make a difference.
-What, uh, literally?

821
00:49:42.354 --> 00:49:43.772
Yeah.

822
00:49:44.856 --> 00:49:45.857
Sad.

823
00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:50.862
Yeah, it's sad. Until he throws you
across the room, it's sad.

824
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:55.117
I'm just afraid to live with him,
and I'm afraid to live without-- You know,

825
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.245
you didn't come to work
to hear this stuff. I'm really sorry.

826
00:49:58.328 --> 00:50:00.664
-That's all right.
-I'm gonna clean this up.

827
00:50:08.922 --> 00:50:12.926
I'm, uh, I'm just surprised.
I thought everything was okay, you know.

828
00:50:13.802 --> 00:50:16.430
I figured you got a nice car,
a nice house, you got some money.

829
00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:17.931
Everything's okay.

830
00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:20.475
It should be, but it's not.

831
00:50:21.226 --> 00:50:23.228
It's twisted, and it's distorted,

832
00:50:23.311 --> 00:50:26.064
and it can't be changed,
and it cannot be saved.

833
00:50:33.572 --> 00:50:34.573
I'll go with you.

834
00:50:40.287 --> 00:50:41.371
Really?

835
00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:44.124
Yeah.

836
00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:47.294
We have to get a car.

837
00:50:48.837 --> 00:50:50.756
Let's get through the night, first.

838
00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:52.841
-I have money.
-How much?

839
00:50:52.924 --> 00:50:54.968
$52,000.

840
00:50:57.471 --> 00:50:58.472
On you?

841
00:51:00.432 --> 00:51:01.892
[whispers] In my purse.

842
00:51:04.436 --> 00:51:05.771
[gulps]

843
00:51:15.614 --> 00:51:17.365
[Jim] $52,000. Wow.

844
00:51:18.784 --> 00:51:22.996
I've never seen so much money in my life.
[sniffs] This is more than my house cost.

845
00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:25.832
Jim…

846
00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:30.629
now that I'm spending the night,
how can I pay you back

847
00:51:30.712 --> 00:51:32.589
for being so cold to you in high school?

848
00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:38.553
-Do you need an answer right away?
-No.

849
00:51:40.222 --> 00:51:41.598
Sometime before the sun comes up.

850
00:51:45.519 --> 00:51:46.812
Well, uh…

851
00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:51.399
you're probably not going
to remember this, but, uh…

852
00:51:52.567 --> 00:51:54.820
there was a homecoming dance
our sophomore year.

853
00:51:54.903 --> 00:51:57.739
-Mmm-hmm.
-Uh, do you remember Mrs. Noble?

854
00:51:59.032 --> 00:52:03.286
Large, hairy gym teacher with

That's right. A full-scale PMS.

Ned, they're putting down the guns.

I think everybody at one time
in their life is full of shit.

1069

I'll throw on a couple of corn dogs
and we'll get to know each other.

1070

No.

1073
01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:58.074
Sorry. I could've sworn
you had the big one.

1074
01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.367
Ha!

1075
01:08:02.453 --> 01:08:03.579
I lied.

1076
01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:11.295
These are the men
that killed that guy in Saltburg.

1077

I'm fairly sure that we're gonna die.

1078

I want to tell you how disappointed I am

1079
01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:19.345
-we're not going to California together.
-We're not dead yet.

1080

-Pretty darn close.
-No.

1081

If I can get them to take me with them,

1082
01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:28.813
maybe I can get away
and come back for you.

1083

-No.
-Well, then don't knock ours.

1094
01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:22.658
Crime isn't a job. It's a sickness.

1095

-This one?

I'm not helping you load your car.

1117

Think again, boy.

1118
01:11:59.523 --> 01:12:03.402
[Jim] You're not going to take the stolen
merchandise out of the store. No.

-I'm not gonna let you.
-Get out.

It's stolen. All of it!

-[Jim] No!

-Yeah.

anything about him.
