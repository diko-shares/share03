1
00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:55.985
That wasn't a store robbery.

2
00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:58.087
That was an assassination.

3
00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.323
That wasn't a clerk.
That was a wise guy.

4
00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:04.759
How do I know?

5
00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:08.362
I spent a little time with the
FBI's organized crime unit.

6
00:01:08.364 --> 00:01:10.764
I guess you could say that
I'm intimately knowledgeable

7
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.866
with the seedy and rancorous
workings of the mob

8
00:01:12.868 --> 00:01:15.435
in the Midwest section of this country.

9
00:01:15.437 --> 00:01:17.603
I know a gangland slaying when I see one,

10
00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:19.738
and that's exactly what this baby is.

11
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.541
I'd look into it myself personally,
but I got a date tonight.

12
00:01:23.543 --> 00:01:26.277
<i>Think I'll take the private jet out</i>

13
00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:29.079
<i>and fly to Spain, pick up the little lady.</i>

14
00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:31.881
Do the subsonic tummy bump at 30,000 feet.

15
00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:34.683
Then glide back into the U.S.
of A. By dawn.

16
00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:39.286
I know what you're gonna say,
"Jim. Jim Dodge, settle down."

17
00:01:39.288 --> 00:01:41.621
<i>"Relax. You owe it to
yourself."</i>

18
00:01:41.623 --> 00:01:43.789
I'll tell you what I tell everybody else.

19
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:47.793
Any little <i>Fraulein</i> that
expects anything more from me

20
00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:49.427
than a little bit of pleasure
and a little bit of danger

21
00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.695
and a great set of pectorals,

22
00:01:51.697 --> 00:01:53.657
she's looking for a fall right on her ass.

23
00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.369
Hubie, Hubie, Hubie, Hubie!

24
00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:02.371
Get out of here!
Let me tell you something.

25
00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:05.006
If you know what's good for
you, don't you ever come back!

26
00:02:05.742 --> 00:02:07.608
Wait a minute, now, Hubie.

27
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.910
You're not gonna find someone who has
the relationship with those animals

28
00:02:09.912 --> 00:02:11.611
that I do.

29
00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:14.313
Listen to the dogs, Hubie.
They love me!

30
00:02:15.883 --> 00:02:19.050
It all started when I was 15.

31
00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:22.086
That's when I invented
the artificial cow heart.

32
00:02:22.088 --> 00:02:24.755
That was a big thing.

33
00:02:24.757 --> 00:02:28.058
A little before your time, but
it made all the newspapers,

34
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.727
ABC, NBC, CBS, they all picked up on it,

35
00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:34.063
but it's more or less a hobby for me, boys.

36
00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.299
Scoot over!

37
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:39.634
Actually,

38
00:02:40.837 --> 00:02:44.605
today I decided that I've gone
just about as far I can go

39
00:02:44.607 --> 00:02:46.807
in the animal
health-care business.

40
00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:50.076
But that's your question. The reason
that I'm not at work this afternoon,

41
00:02:50.078 --> 00:02:54.847
is because I was made an offer that
I simply cannot refuse. I sold.

42
00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.615
Whatcha gonna do with the cash, Jim?

43
00:02:56.617 --> 00:02:58.583
I don't know. Maybe
I'll invest it overseas.

44
00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:00.618
I've got some projects
in eastern Europe right now.

45
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.419
I don't know. I've got
everything a man needs.

46
00:03:02.421 --> 00:03:05.455
Jim, you just bought the animal hospital.

47
00:03:05.457 --> 00:03:08.156
How come you sold it so fast?

48
00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.259
Tax problem.

49
00:03:12.261 --> 00:03:14.628
And here's my accountant right now.

50
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.030
Earl, take a bow.

51
00:03:17.032 --> 00:03:20.299
20 minutes for lunch, okay?
Go buy another suit.

52
00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:22.467
He works for me.

53
00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.802
He's scouting some
real estate for me right now.

54
00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:27.337
Yeah, but the market's real tight.

55
00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:32.574
I like the new uniform, Lorraine.

56
00:03:35.045 --> 00:03:37.311
You know, with the right shoes and handbag,

57
00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:39.546
that might be suitable for a cocktail party.

58
00:03:40.115 --> 00:03:42.548
So... Question.

59
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.018
When in the world are you going
to start serving sashimi?

60
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.053
Maybe when I find out what it is.

61
00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.956
You've never heard of sashimi?

62
00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.158
You've got to be kidding.

63
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.461
It's this special Japanese fish you eat raw.

64
00:03:58.463 --> 00:04:00.029
With a little butter sauce,

65
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:03.132
and you're ready to go to heaven.

66
00:04:03.134 --> 00:04:08.170
I'd hire you in a minute if I hadn't
already fired you so many times.

67
00:04:08.172 --> 00:04:10.872
Did you ever think of leaving town?

68
00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:15.309
Thousands of people
over in St. Louis...

69
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.478
Got no idea how full of shit you are.

70
00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:23.816
You've been alive for 21 years, my friend.

71
00:04:23.818 --> 00:04:28.052
Plenty of time for most people
to find a place for themselves.

72
00:04:29.488 --> 00:04:32.155
Well, I'm not like everybody else.

73
00:04:32.157 --> 00:04:34.724
You know what I'm saying?

74
00:04:34.726 --> 00:04:36.892
Yeah, that's for sure.

75
00:04:39.363 --> 00:04:41.663
How about if I...

76
00:04:41.665 --> 00:04:43.898
I work for you for free?

77
00:04:45.835 --> 00:04:48.268
No.

78
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.803
I'm afraid not, Jimmy.

79
00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:54.171
Think about St. Louis.

80
00:04:55.707 --> 00:04:57.239
- Hey, Josie.
- Hi.

81
00:04:57.241 --> 00:04:58.506
Fill her up?

82
00:04:58.508 --> 00:04:59.740
Fill her up.

83
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.926
How you doin'?

84
00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:39.542
You got fired again,
didn't you? Didn't you?

85
00:05:39.544 --> 00:05:41.243
Yeah.

86
00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:42.611
Who told you that?

87
00:05:42.613 --> 00:05:45.046
Hubie Marshall called me at work.

88
00:05:45.048 --> 00:05:47.214
He called you at work?

89
00:05:47.216 --> 00:05:51.050
That's it. Okay, I'm gonna... I'll speak...
What'd he say?

90
00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:53.886
He said he fired ya!

91
00:05:53.888 --> 00:05:56.255
He said that?
And you believed him?

92
00:05:56.257 --> 00:05:58.090
Damn straight I do!

93
00:05:58.092 --> 00:06:03.061
With all due respect, Dad, you're Mr.
Gullible, sometimes.

94
00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:05.296
The truth of the matter is, Dad, I resigned.

95
00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:07.397
I'll tell you something else, Dad.

96
00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.431
Shut up, Jimmy!

97
00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:10.633
When I took the job, I had no idea

98
00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:13.669
it was gonna be
a hire-fire situation.

99
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:16.138
Luther Betenhauser's boy
is doing much better.

100
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.439
What's wrong with him?

101
00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:18.740
Fell off his grandfather's silo.

102
00:06:18.742 --> 00:06:20.074
He's got brain damage.

103
00:06:20.076 --> 00:06:21.308
He does not.

104
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.942
He does, too.

105
00:06:22.944 --> 00:06:24.743
Hoover Fey says his tongue's gonna hang out

106
00:06:24.745 --> 00:06:26.444
the side of his mouth the rest of his life.

107
00:06:26.446 --> 00:06:28.245
And when he dies and they bury him,

108
00:06:28.247 --> 00:06:30.580
at the funeral they're
gonna put a mask on him.

109
00:06:30.582 --> 00:06:33.015
Do I have to listen to
this while I'm eating?

110
00:06:33.684 --> 00:06:35.717
Let's talk about something else.

111
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.290
Josie McClellan moved to New York.

112
00:06:43.292 --> 00:06:46.259
She did not. I saw her today.

113
00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:48.261
Well, I don't know how you could.

114
00:06:48.263 --> 00:06:51.197
I heard at the bank that she got
tired of taking care of her father,

115
00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.965
and she told him to jump in a lake,

116
00:06:52.967 --> 00:06:56.034
and then she left for New York to
get her MBA in high-fashion design

117
00:06:56.036 --> 00:06:58.703
at the University of New York City.

118
00:06:58.705 --> 00:07:02.472
I just saw her down at the
gas station in living color.

119
00:07:02.474 --> 00:07:05.107
We had a cup of java together.

120
00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:09.177
Well, I'm gonna take Lou Selby's
word over yours any day.

121
00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.947
Lou Selby.
Lou Selby's a drunk.

122
00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:15.716
You know, for a guy who's just
lost his umpteenth job,

123
00:07:15.718 --> 00:07:17.684
you sure are handy with the tongue sword.

124
00:07:17.686 --> 00:07:19.786
You got canned again?

125
00:07:19.788 --> 00:07:21.788
Well, he didn't get canned.

126
00:07:22.724 --> 00:07:23.889
He got fired.

127
00:07:25.225 --> 00:07:27.105
That's gotta be some kind of a record.

128
00:07:31.496 --> 00:07:33.462
Not only are you an obnoxious slug,

129
00:07:33.464 --> 00:07:36.231
but you're a freeloading obnoxious slug.

130
00:07:36.233 --> 00:07:38.132
Well, you should talk.

131
00:07:38.134 --> 00:07:40.654
What are you? In your mid-forties
and still living at home.

132
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.537
I'm 24, and I pay rent.

133
00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:46.237
So do I.

134
00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:47.371
You did pay rent.

135
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.640
Dad, you mean you're cutting my rent?

136
00:07:51.642 --> 00:07:53.708
Hell, no!

137
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.476
You're not paying a rent
'cause you don't have a job

138
00:07:55.478 --> 00:07:57.077
and you don't have any money.

139
00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.779
You're out of school and you live
in this house, you pay rent!

140
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:21.900
Jim! Yo, Jim!

141
00:08:21.902 --> 00:08:23.935
Jim, wake up!

142
00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:26.271
Hey, get up!

143
00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.574
Get up!

144
00:08:35.013 --> 00:08:38.147
You know, getting this job,

145
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:40.282
restoring your faith and pride in me

146
00:08:40.284 --> 00:08:42.350
is a number-one
priority right now, Dad.

147
00:08:42.352 --> 00:08:45.720
Priority ought to be making
something of yourself.

148
00:08:45.722 --> 00:08:47.455
That's right up there.

149
00:08:47.457 --> 00:08:51.691
When I was your age, I couldn't
wait to get out of my folks' house.

150
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:55.193
I love living at home.

151
00:09:05.838 --> 00:09:09.238
I don't think this is such a
great place for me to work, Dad.

152
00:09:11.875 --> 00:09:13.541
Okay,

153
00:09:13.543 --> 00:09:16.744
say I don't get this job, hypothetically.

154
00:09:17.379 --> 00:09:18.911
Are you gonna be upset?

155
00:09:18.913 --> 00:09:22.313
You don't get this job,
you're on a bus to St. Louis.

156
00:09:22.315 --> 00:09:24.081
St. Louis?

157
00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:26.817
Uncle Jeff's offered to put you
to work in his garden shop.

158
00:09:26.819 --> 00:09:28.718
I don't know anything about gardening.

159
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.153
You will learn!

160
00:09:31.155 --> 00:09:34.523
I'm getting a distinct feeling
that you want me out of your life.

161
00:09:34.525 --> 00:09:37.558
I don't want you out of my life.
I want you out of my house.

162
00:09:39.428 --> 00:09:41.060
Wow.
Out!

163
00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:42.895
Okay, okay, okay.

164
00:09:58.845 --> 00:10:01.612
Are you sure I can't offer you
a coffee and a bear claw?

165
00:10:01.614 --> 00:10:03.180
No, thanks.

166
00:10:03.182 --> 00:10:04.915
They're very good, they're fresh.

167
00:10:04.917 --> 00:10:06.683
No, I'm fine.

168
00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:08.685
You don't want one, and I don't need one.

169
00:10:10.121 --> 00:10:11.453
Right!

170
00:10:11.455 --> 00:10:13.254
I love the darn things, though, I tell you.

171
00:10:13.256 --> 00:10:15.556
You know, I got a sweet tooth, I
could eat those things by the dozen.

172
00:10:15.558 --> 00:10:17.257
By the looks of it, I have.

173
00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:18.891
Right.

174
00:10:18.893 --> 00:10:22.561
I tell ya, I'm so excited
that you're considering

175
00:10:22.563 --> 00:10:25.096
joining the Target team.
We all are.

176
00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:28.032
I appreciate that.

177
00:10:28.034 --> 00:10:31.535
Good, then, let's cut
right to the chase, shall we?

178
00:10:32.704 --> 00:10:36.105
We're prepared to offer you $42,500 a year,

179
00:10:36.107 --> 00:10:38.273
with a full benefit package.

180
00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:41.041
That's dental, medical,

181
00:10:41.043 --> 00:10:43.143
profit sharing, pension,

182
00:10:43.145 --> 00:10:45.979
expense account, car allowance,

183
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:47.914
vacation, of course,

184
00:10:47.916 --> 00:10:51.284
and any and all relocating expenses.

185
00:10:51.286 --> 00:10:55.821
This is our first, best, and last offer.
What do you think?

186
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.623
Well...

187
00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:01.826
C.D., with all due respect,

188
00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.561
I came in here

189
00:11:03.563 --> 00:11:06.463
with the number 45 in my mind, and...

190
00:11:28.582 --> 00:11:31.115
You've got me.

191
00:11:32.184 --> 00:11:33.750
45 it is.

192
00:11:35.253 --> 00:11:36.652
Welcome aboard.

193
00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.086
Thank you.

194
00:11:38.088 --> 00:11:39.253
I'd like to buy you lunch.

195
00:11:39.255 --> 00:11:40.654
No, no, no.

196
00:11:40.656 --> 00:11:42.822
Your money's no good here.
Lunch is mine, all right?

197
00:11:42.824 --> 00:11:44.323
I'm not going to argue with you.

198
00:11:44.325 --> 00:11:46.205
You better not.
I'm bigger than you are.

199
00:11:47.294 --> 00:11:49.260
Hang on a second, will you?
I told her to hold my calls.

200
00:11:49.262 --> 00:11:50.794
Get it.

201
00:11:50.796 --> 00:11:52.328
Yeah, Peg.

202
00:11:53.264 --> 00:11:55.931
No, it's okay.

203
00:11:55.933 --> 00:11:57.465
No, he's right here with me now.

204
00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:58.966
Hi, Peg.

205
00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:01.268
We just closed the deal.

206
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.504
It was a slam-dunk, too.
I got him for 45.

207
00:12:10.644 --> 00:12:12.510
No, he's right here.

208
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.679
What do you mean, he missed the plane?

209
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.416
Then who the hell am I talking to?

210
00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:25.352
Lord!

211
00:12:26.988 --> 00:12:30.355
I'll...
I'll get back to you.

212
00:12:31.891 --> 00:12:33.690
Hey, I know a great little Italian place

213
00:12:33.692 --> 00:12:36.626
that has the best pasta primatonis in the...

214
00:12:36.628 --> 00:12:38.461
Excuse me a minute, will you, please?

215
00:12:38.463 --> 00:12:39.895
Lovely wife you have there.

216
00:12:39.897 --> 00:12:41.296
Dodge, James?

217
00:12:45.967 --> 00:12:48.701
James, I'm afraid we have a
little misunderstanding here.

218
00:12:48.703 --> 00:12:51.370
You see, I thought you came in for the...

219
00:12:51.372 --> 00:12:54.706
Operations Manager's job.

220
00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:57.208
I have you down here as night cleanup boy.

221
00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:02.345
Well, I'm a little overpaid

222
00:13:02.347 --> 00:13:05.247
for night cleanup boy,
wouldn't you say, C.D.?

223
00:13:06.984 --> 00:13:10.518
The truth is, James, I can
offer you $4.44 per hour.

224
00:13:14.056 --> 00:13:17.523
Four, four... $4.44...

225
00:13:17.525 --> 00:13:19.324
$4.44.

226
00:13:19.326 --> 00:13:21.259
What about the benefits?

227
00:13:21.261 --> 00:13:23.661
Two fifteen-minute breaks
and a half hour for lunch.

228
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:28.899
And the title is, night cleanup boy?

229
00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:30.899
Yes.

230
00:13:33.403 --> 00:13:35.202
I'll take it.

231
00:13:35.204 --> 00:13:37.337
And, lose the curl.

232
00:13:38.873 --> 00:13:40.973
Welcome to the Target team.
Thank you.

233
00:13:42.676 --> 00:13:45.943
So the parrot says, "Of course, I can talk.
Can you fly?"

234
00:13:50.515 --> 00:13:54.349
I don't want any damn Japanese
automobile plant in this town.

235
00:13:57.187 --> 00:13:59.187
It means jobs.

236
00:14:00.356 --> 00:14:02.289
I don't need a job.

237
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:05.358
Your governor's tryin' to use
my town as a political chip.

238
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.093
Gentlemen, I resent that.

239
00:14:07.095 --> 00:14:10.996
Well, there could be some specific
benefits for you personally.

240
00:14:14.934 --> 00:14:16.799
Josie!

241
00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.570
Yeah?
Come here.

242
00:14:21.572 --> 00:14:24.772
I want you to meet these gentlemen
from the governor's office.

243
00:14:25.941 --> 00:14:28.107
Come on in here, honey.

244
00:14:44.623 --> 00:14:45.989
Honey, I want you to meet Bill...

245
00:14:45.991 --> 00:14:47.323
Bob.

246
00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:50.292
Bob Bosenbeck.

247
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:54.794
Bob.

248
00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:11.976
Dave.

249
00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:17.414
My pleasure, Dave.

250
00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:21.117
Right.
Dave Hockner.

251
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.354
I don't want to interrupt your meeting.

252
00:15:25.356 --> 00:15:27.456
Very nice to meet both of you.

253
00:15:27.758 --> 00:15:29.524
Bye.

254
00:15:29.526 --> 00:15:31.192
Bye.

255
00:15:36.032 --> 00:15:37.831
Josie?

256
00:15:39.234 --> 00:15:40.800
Josie!

257
00:15:48.373 --> 00:15:51.607
You pull another stunt like you did today,

258
00:15:51.609 --> 00:15:54.443
I'll beat the livin' daylights outta you!

259
00:16:15.729 --> 00:16:16.894
All right, out!

260
00:16:20.232 --> 00:16:24.000
Out of here, man.
Get out of here!

261
00:16:24.002 --> 00:16:25.134
Get out of the car!

262
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:46.982
Right on time!

263
00:16:50.354 --> 00:16:52.253
Everything's going as planned.

264
00:16:53.422 --> 00:16:54.654
You ordered a limousine?

265
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.223
Of course.

266
00:16:59.025 --> 00:17:00.424
My first day at work.

267
00:17:00.426 --> 00:17:03.493
How's it gonna look if my dad drives me?

268
00:17:03.495 --> 00:17:05.595
A little treat to
myself for getting the job.

269
00:17:05.597 --> 00:17:07.496
It was only 50 bucks.

270
00:17:09.999 --> 00:17:11.331
Right on time, Henry.

271
00:17:11.333 --> 00:17:12.999
Yes, sir.

272
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:14.767
Henry, the sign...

273
00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:16.435
Very well, sir.

274
00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:21.838
Ciao!

275
00:17:28.345 --> 00:17:30.845
Hey, Jim, where are you going?

276
00:17:31.714 --> 00:17:34.281
Hello, boys.

277
00:17:34.283 --> 00:17:36.716
Going to Paris on an F-14.

278
00:17:36.718 --> 00:17:39.618
Got a little peace meeting with
the Vice-President of Bulgaria.

279
00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.454
Business, you know?
Then I'm going to Venice,

280
00:17:42.456 --> 00:17:45.123
for a big spaghetti dinner
with the princess of Austria.

281
00:17:45.125 --> 00:17:47.792
A beautiful lady...
Really big bones.

282
00:17:47.794 --> 00:17:50.561
Remember to brush your teeth, Melvin!

283
00:17:50.563 --> 00:17:53.797
You, too, Sidney! <i>Adios!</i>

284
00:17:55.901 --> 00:17:58.268
Jim is so cool!

285
00:19:25.125 --> 00:19:26.241
Bobby.

286
00:19:27.642 --> 00:19:29.958
Got a loose tile here.
First thing in the morning,

287
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.427
I want you to take some epoxy
cement and take care of this.

288
00:19:32.429 --> 00:19:34.562
I don't need a lawsuit, okay?

289
00:19:34.564 --> 00:19:37.064
I've got enough to worry about.

290
00:19:38.767 --> 00:19:40.066
Who's he?

291
00:19:40.068 --> 00:19:41.667
<i>Attention shoppers.</i>

292
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:43.502
<i>The store will be closing in five minutes.</i>

293
00:19:43.504 --> 00:19:46.805
<i>Please bring all your purchases
to the front. Thank you.</i>

294
00:20:25.645 --> 00:20:26.877
Are you a slacker?

295
00:20:27.813 --> 00:20:31.047
No, Presbyterian.

296
00:20:31.049 --> 00:20:33.349
What did you say?
What did you say?

297
00:20:33.351 --> 00:20:35.451
I'm askin' you a simple question.

298
00:20:35.453 --> 00:20:37.686
Are you lazy?
No, sir.

299
00:20:37.688 --> 00:20:40.021
'Cause the last guy that wore
that uniform was a lazy slacker,

300
00:20:40.023 --> 00:20:41.856
and I fired his no-good butt.

301
00:20:43.226 --> 00:20:45.993
About the uniform,

302
00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.627
will I be getting my own?

303
00:20:47.629 --> 00:20:50.062
You work out, which I doubt,

304
00:20:50.064 --> 00:20:51.797
you can have yourself a new name patch.

305
00:20:56.869 --> 00:20:59.502
Would I be able to have it laundered?

306
00:20:59.504 --> 00:21:01.470
It smells a little bit like Darnell.

307
00:21:01.472 --> 00:21:04.473
I don't think you know
who you're messin' with, boy.

308
00:21:04.475 --> 00:21:06.975
Right, after you clean the
ladies' and men's crappers,

309
00:21:06.977 --> 00:21:09.143
I'm talking about you'd better
be able to eat off those bowls.

310
00:21:09.145 --> 00:21:10.978
Sure.
You clean my coffeemaker,

311
00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.546
then you wax my desk.

312
00:21:12.548 --> 00:21:14.814
Clean what?

313
00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:16.549
You clean my coffeemaker and wax my desk!

314
00:21:16.551 --> 00:21:18.584
I got it!

315
00:21:18.586 --> 00:21:20.819
You, sweep the aisles, startin'
with health and beauty,

316
00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:22.687
and you work your way over
to juniors and misses.

317
00:21:22.689 --> 00:21:25.656
Ups and downs, leaving your
debris in the cross aisles.

318
00:21:25.658 --> 00:21:26.823
So I start with health and beauty...

319
00:21:26.825 --> 00:21:28.157
What did I just say?

320
00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:30.192
I just said to start
with health and beauty, okay?

321
00:21:30.194 --> 00:21:31.826
Then you do your cross aisles.

322
00:21:31.828 --> 00:21:33.661
That'll bring your dustbin into play.

323
00:21:33.663 --> 00:21:35.929
You take the debris.
You load it into the dustbin.

324
00:21:35.931 --> 00:21:38.831
You take the dustbin out
to the loading dock area

325
00:21:38.833 --> 00:21:40.732
and you empty it into the receptacle.

326
00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:42.033
You got that? Easy as pie.

327
00:21:42.035 --> 00:21:43.667
Yeah.

328
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:45.669
Now, I was employed for a brief
period at Del Taco, and...

329
00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:48.505
I don't care about your
Del Taco experiences, boy.

330
00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:51.007
All right. Now, we've got this little
problem in this store with grazers.

331
00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:52.775
You know what a grazer is, boy?

332
00:21:52.777 --> 00:21:55.010
Is that some sort of farm term?

333
00:21:55.012 --> 00:21:56.778
A grazer is a customer or an employee

334
00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.513
that eats off the shelves, okay?

335
00:21:58.515 --> 00:22:01.349
Sort of similar to a cow
grazing in a field of grass.

336
00:22:01.351 --> 00:22:03.951
Only this isn't a field of grass,
okay, and you're not a cow.

337
00:22:03.953 --> 00:22:06.586
There's no eatin'. You're not
being paid to eat, so don't!

338
00:22:06.588 --> 00:22:08.054
You got any questions?

339
00:22:08.056 --> 00:22:09.455
Not right offhand, no.

340
00:22:09.457 --> 00:22:10.956
You think you can handle it?

341
00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:12.390
I'll give it the old college try.

342
00:22:12.392 --> 00:22:13.991
Don't touch me!

343
00:22:14.927 --> 00:22:17.360
Well, despite our age difference,

344
00:22:17.362 --> 00:22:19.028
I think I'm really gonna
enjoy working with you.

345
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.230
Let's get something straight, boy.
You ain't workin' with me.

346
00:22:21.232 --> 00:22:23.198
You're working for me.

347
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.867
Still, I think it's gonna
be fun being around you.

348
00:22:25.869 --> 00:22:27.435
Yeah, I ain't gonna be anywhere near you.

349
00:22:27.437 --> 00:22:29.937
I'm gonna be home pumping the
pasties out of Colleen Jackson.

350
00:22:29.939 --> 00:22:31.371
You're not going to be here?

351
00:22:31.373 --> 00:22:32.705
Hell, no.

352
00:22:34.308 --> 00:22:37.976
I'm gonna be here by myself?

353
00:22:37.978 --> 00:22:41.712
Yeah, that's right! And you'd better
stay out of the ladies' undergoods.

354
00:22:43.248 --> 00:22:46.616
Wait a minute. Nobody told
me I'd be here alone.

355
00:22:46.618 --> 00:22:48.050
What are you doing?

356
00:22:48.052 --> 00:22:49.418
Saving money.

357
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.386
Wait a minute. Are you
turning off the lights?

358
00:22:51.388 --> 00:22:53.888
In 25 seconds, you got light
in every third aisle.

359
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.122
When the sun comes up, you turn off

360
00:22:55.124 --> 00:22:56.964
all the lights.
You understand?

361
00:22:57.259 --> 00:23:00.226
No, I don't understand.
Just hold on a second!

362
00:23:00.228 --> 00:23:01.994
I'm locking you in.

363
00:23:01.996 --> 00:23:05.363
When I come back at 7:00 to
open up, I'll let you out.

364
00:23:07.633 --> 00:23:09.633
You're locking me in?

365
00:23:09.635 --> 00:23:11.234
What do you take me for, a fool?

366
00:23:11.236 --> 00:23:14.737
Nobody gets a set of keys
on their first night. Nobody!

367
00:23:14.739 --> 00:23:16.705
Now, get to work!

368
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.639
What if there's a fire?

369
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:20.401
Then the fire department will come.

370
00:23:20.676 --> 00:23:21.975
I could perish!

371
00:23:21.977 --> 00:23:23.443
Boo!

372
00:23:23.445 --> 00:23:26.946
You can't do this. I'm locked
in, alone, in the dark.

373
00:23:26.948 --> 00:23:29.014
That was not a part
of my employment agreement.

374
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.782
9:17?

375
00:25:50.418 --> 00:25:53.118
Time for a break.

376
00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:20.142
<i>Hello.</i>

377
00:26:22.412 --> 00:26:24.044
<i>Anybody out there?</i>

378
00:26:24.046 --> 00:26:26.012
<i>When I accepted the...</i>

379
00:26:26.014 --> 00:26:29.281
<i>The post of President,
grand Pooh-Bah of Target,</i>

380
00:26:31.084 --> 00:26:33.651
<i>realizing that I have brought</i>

381
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.120
<i>meaningfulness and peace and happiness,</i>

382
00:26:37.122 --> 00:26:39.489
<i>into the lives of thousands of people.</i>

383
00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:42.858
Jim Dodge, of Monroe,

384
00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.860
top moneymaker on the tour.

385
00:26:44.862 --> 00:26:47.362
His father's here today, Bud Dodge,

386
00:26:47.364 --> 00:26:49.230
and sister Penny, a sad, sad story,

387
00:26:49.232 --> 00:26:52.366
was just admitted to university hospital.

388
00:26:52.368 --> 00:26:56.203
While trying to pop a zit, her
head mysteriously exploded.

389
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.289
<i>Dad! Hi!</i>

390
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:24.224
Jim, do you know what time it is?

391
00:27:24.226 --> 00:27:28.094
You know, I'm starting to think
about Christmas and gifts,

392
00:27:28.096 --> 00:27:31.563
<i>because I'm in a big store and I'm
starting to get a lot of gift ideas.</i>

393
00:27:31.565 --> 00:27:32.897
Hi.

394
00:27:32.899 --> 00:27:34.431
Mom, hi!

395
00:27:34.433 --> 00:27:36.399
How's it going?

396
00:27:36.401 --> 00:27:39.568
Well, I finished all my janitor
stuff, I've finished most of it.

397
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.436
I've got to save some stuff for later.

398
00:27:41.438 --> 00:27:43.504
<i>But it's easy as hell.</i>

399
00:27:43.506 --> 00:27:46.240
Honey, it's a little late.

400
00:27:46.242 --> 00:27:49.343
Yeah, it is kind of late.
Well, sleep tight.

401
00:27:50.679 --> 00:27:52.779
See you in the morning.

402
00:27:52.781 --> 00:27:54.347
Love you, too.

403
00:27:59.586 --> 00:28:01.752
Mr. James Dodge!

404
00:28:57.575 --> 00:29:00.709
He can't be happy as the night cleanup boy.

405
00:29:02.546 --> 00:29:04.279
Sweetheart...

406
00:29:05.181 --> 00:29:07.814
He wants us to call him a janitor.

407
00:29:10.318 --> 00:29:14.586
Maybe I should have spent less time
harping and more time helping.

408
00:29:15.488 --> 00:29:17.888
Harpin' and helpin' him what?

409
00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:23.326
Harpin' on him to leave,
and helpin' him become the...

410
00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:26.429
Good, mature, productive person he could be.

411
00:30:56.585 --> 00:30:58.318
Are you all right?

412
00:30:59.988 --> 00:31:01.854
Yes, I'm fine, thanks.

413
00:31:01.856 --> 00:31:02.921
And you?

414
00:31:04.524 --> 00:31:05.990
What are you doing here?

415
00:31:07.593 --> 00:31:09.926
I work here.

416
00:31:09.928 --> 00:31:11.861
Have a good one, Officer Don.

417
00:31:11.863 --> 00:31:15.830
Okay, Carl. Keep in touch. Let
me know if you hear anything.

418
00:31:15.832 --> 00:31:17.398
You bet.

419
00:31:19.301 --> 00:31:21.634
Well, sir, she didn't leave on the bus.

420
00:31:21.636 --> 00:31:24.837
Apparently, she isn't here. Let's
go look for her someplace else.

421
00:31:24.839 --> 00:31:28.273
She wouldn't be dumb
enough to thumb, would she?

422
00:31:28.275 --> 00:31:31.775
Does she have any friends that
she might have run off with?

423
00:31:32.344 --> 00:31:34.110
Boyfriends?

424
00:31:34.112 --> 00:31:37.613
Would you just get in the car so we
can go look for the girl, please?

425
00:31:37.615 --> 00:31:39.648
I'm tired, I had to get out of the bed,

426
00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.683
I haven't had any coffee.
I don't feel good.

427
00:31:41.685 --> 00:31:43.051
My daughter, I don't know
where the hell she is.

428
00:31:43.053 --> 00:31:44.819
And you're standing by the car there,

429
00:31:44.821 --> 00:31:46.654
sounding like some goddamn
preacher or something!

430
00:31:46.656 --> 00:31:48.288
Come on. Get in the car!

431
00:31:50.058 --> 00:31:51.290
Prick.

432
00:31:56.163 --> 00:31:58.463
Are you sure you didn't hurt yourself?

433
00:31:58.465 --> 00:32:01.165
No. Are you kidding?

434
00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:03.700
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

435
00:32:03.702 --> 00:32:05.134
Can I ask what you were doing?

436
00:32:05.136 --> 00:32:07.136
I was roller-skating.

437
00:32:08.005 --> 00:32:09.671
I know, but why?

438
00:32:09.673 --> 00:32:11.806
Why not?

439
00:32:11.808 --> 00:32:15.476
I got bored. One thing
led to another and...

440
00:32:15.478 --> 00:32:18.579
And I'm roller-skating
in my shorts.

441
00:32:18.581 --> 00:32:20.881
Better question would be,
"What are you doing here?"

442
00:32:21.583 --> 00:32:23.316
Shopping.

443
00:32:23.318 --> 00:32:25.918
Well, we've been closed for five hours.

444
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.186
Yeah. I fell asleep.

445
00:32:28.188 --> 00:32:29.687
While shopping?

446
00:32:29.689 --> 00:32:31.321
No, in the ladies' dressing room.

447
00:32:31.323 --> 00:32:34.891
That makes no sense. You're a
high-profile young ingenue.

448
00:32:34.893 --> 00:32:36.692
I was debating...
What?

449
00:32:36.694 --> 00:32:40.095
Whether or not to get
arrested for shoplifting.

450
00:32:40.097 --> 00:32:43.264
Doesn't your father own, like, $10 million
worth of real estate in this town?

451
00:32:43.266 --> 00:32:45.065
Well, it's not my fault.

452
00:32:45.067 --> 00:32:46.833
No, no, I didn't imply such.

453
00:32:46.835 --> 00:32:50.069
It just seems funny that someone of your...

454
00:32:50.071 --> 00:32:51.837
Wealth?

455
00:32:51.839 --> 00:32:53.505
If you will.
Would be shoplifting...

456
00:32:53.507 --> 00:32:55.974
I didn't do it.
I chickened out.

457
00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:59.610
Would consider shoplifting.

458
00:32:59.612 --> 00:33:03.346
It's a long, dull, self-indulgent,
highly unromantic story

459
00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:05.848
about an overbearing father,

460
00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.050
deceased mother and brother

461
00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:11.686
and a completely confused girl
who looks a little like me.

462
00:33:49.455 --> 00:33:52.255
I sure am glad you dropped by.

463
00:33:52.257 --> 00:33:55.057
I was getting pretty
tired of being with myself.

464
00:33:58.095 --> 00:34:01.896
I guess... I guess, I'm what
you call a people person.

465
00:34:05.067 --> 00:34:06.299
What are you cooking?

466
00:34:06.301 --> 00:34:07.466
Hobo Chicken.

467
00:34:07.468 --> 00:34:09.835
It's a glazed chicken in wine sauce

468
00:34:09.837 --> 00:34:12.771
with vegetables
and skin-on potatoes.

469
00:34:12.773 --> 00:34:14.973
Silverware... Silverware...

470
00:34:18.278 --> 00:34:20.244
It's only 210 calories.

471
00:34:20.246 --> 00:34:22.512
And I don't know if you're watching

472
00:34:22.514 --> 00:34:24.747
your figure, but I sure am.

473
00:34:24.749 --> 00:34:26.949
If you can just grab a serving spoon

474
00:34:26.951 --> 00:34:29.084
over there, I think we'll be set.

475
00:34:34.357 --> 00:34:36.523
Keep your distance from these things.

476
00:34:36.525 --> 00:34:38.758
I think it's safe to keep five feet.

477
00:34:43.764 --> 00:34:45.929
I think they're about done.

478
00:34:48.099 --> 00:34:50.498
Well, dining room's right this way.

479
00:34:57.671 --> 00:35:01.271
I think my father poured
the cement for your pool.

480
00:35:02.707 --> 00:35:05.707
He's a cement contractor.
Good man.

481
00:35:06.843 --> 00:35:08.375
Bud Dodge?

482
00:35:08.377 --> 00:35:11.177
My mother works at Hoenicker's
over Christmas, part time.

483
00:35:11.179 --> 00:35:13.045
My sister's a teller at the bank.

484
00:35:13.047 --> 00:35:15.947
My brother's in grade school.
He's not employed at the moment.

485
00:35:15.949 --> 00:35:18.683
I used to work at the animal shelter.

486
00:35:18.685 --> 00:35:22.186
But I was terminated. And now...
Now I'm working here.

487
00:35:24.657 --> 00:35:26.289
Do you always talk this much?

488
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.561
Yeah, I guess I do.

489
00:35:31.563 --> 00:35:33.629
I like talking to people.

490
00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:38.066
I was thinking maybe
you should go into sales.

491
00:35:38.068 --> 00:35:39.333
I've actually tried that.

492
00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:49.108
Some fresh ground pepper?

493
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:50.542
Please.

494
00:35:53.013 --> 00:35:54.846
Some people don't like a lot of pepper.

495
00:35:54.848 --> 00:35:56.647
Say when.
That's fine.

496
00:35:57.850 --> 00:35:59.616
I happen to really like it a lot.

497
00:35:59.618 --> 00:36:03.152
I think it enhances the natural
flavor of the chicken.

498
00:36:06.757 --> 00:36:09.491
I hope you don't take this the wrong way.

499
00:36:10.327 --> 00:36:12.460
I've had dreams about you.

500
00:36:12.462 --> 00:36:14.661
You've had dreams about me?

501
00:36:16.264 --> 00:36:17.763
Not recently.

502
00:36:17.765 --> 00:36:19.931
I've had dreams about you in the past.

503
00:36:19.933 --> 00:36:22.433
I've had dreams about
entire cheerleading squads,

504
00:36:22.435 --> 00:36:24.501
so don't get me wrong.

505
00:36:24.503 --> 00:36:26.769
It's kid stuff, you know.
How 'bout you?

506
00:36:26.771 --> 00:36:28.237
Do I dream?

507
00:36:30.608 --> 00:36:32.541
That's about all I do.

508
00:36:46.489 --> 00:36:50.023
- Raisin' a kid's hard work.
- You got any kids?

509
00:36:50.025 --> 00:36:52.892
No, sir. No, sir. And from
listening to you talking

510
00:36:52.894 --> 00:36:54.793
and from observin' this,

511
00:36:54.795 --> 00:36:58.029
I'm kinda grateful old Emily
turned up infertile.

512
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.980
Shouldn't you be cleaning up the store?

513
00:37:18.816 --> 00:37:20.315
I got plenty of time.

514
00:37:20.884 --> 00:37:22.916
Big store.
Huge.

515
00:37:24.819 --> 00:37:26.285
Always smoke cigars?

516
00:37:27.855 --> 00:37:30.222
I enjoy a good one after a fine meal.

517
00:37:30.224 --> 00:37:32.224
It settles the stomach.

518
00:37:33.393 --> 00:37:35.059
You're the town liar, right?

519
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:41.096
What?

520
00:37:41.098 --> 00:37:45.166
I'm sorry.
That really came out wrong.

521
00:37:45.168 --> 00:37:46.834
I don't see how something like
that could come out right.

522
00:37:46.836 --> 00:37:48.268
I guess I meant that's what people call you.

523
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:49.669
But I didn't mean to imply
that it's actually true.

524
00:37:49.671 --> 00:37:50.870
People are actually calling me that?

525
00:37:50.872 --> 00:37:52.504
I thought you knew.

526
00:37:52.506 --> 00:37:54.005
Know what?
That I was the town liar?

527
00:37:54.007 --> 00:37:55.239
You didn't?

528
00:37:55.241 --> 00:37:56.573
No. I'm not.

529
00:37:56.575 --> 00:37:58.174
I think that you might have
the wrong information.

530
00:37:58.176 --> 00:37:59.341
I didn't mean to offend you.

531
00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:02.076
Did you think that was a compliment?

532
00:38:02.078 --> 00:38:04.244
No. No. And I apologize.

533
00:38:04.246 --> 00:38:06.879
You know, I can't repeat things like that.

534
00:38:06.881 --> 00:38:09.448
Don't think about it.
It's all right.

535
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:12.050
As I said, I think you've got
the wrong information.

536
00:38:12.052 --> 00:38:14.052
But, if people are calling me that,

537
00:38:14.054 --> 00:38:16.687
it's only because they're small,
cheap, petty, and jealous.

538
00:38:16.689 --> 00:38:19.189
Small towns are notorious
for that kinda thing.

539
00:38:19.191 --> 00:38:20.423
I'm sure there's a word for me.

540
00:38:20.425 --> 00:38:21.857
Yeah. Sure.

541
00:38:21.859 --> 00:38:23.058
What do they call me?

542
00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.292
A tease.

543
00:38:24.294 --> 00:38:25.693
Tease?

544
00:38:27.563 --> 00:38:29.963
Yeah, I can see that.

545
00:38:31.366 --> 00:38:33.966
Actually, I never teased.

546
00:38:33.968 --> 00:38:36.301
This is becoming amusing.

547
00:38:36.303 --> 00:38:38.202
Who exactly calls me a liar?

548
00:38:38.204 --> 00:38:40.070
Everybody.

549
00:38:40.072 --> 00:38:41.704
Everybody.
No, not everybody.

550
00:38:41.706 --> 00:38:43.205
I'm sure there's some old people in town.

551
00:38:43.207 --> 00:38:44.639
Right.

552
00:38:50.913 --> 00:38:52.612
Well, what do you think?

553
00:38:52.614 --> 00:38:54.279
What do I think?

554
00:38:56.216 --> 00:38:58.082
Do you think I'm a liar?

555
00:38:58.084 --> 00:39:00.283
Well, I don't know you well enough.

556
00:39:01.986 --> 00:39:03.986
You've known me for almost 17 years.

557
00:39:03.988 --> 00:39:06.388
We went to the same schools
from kindergarten on up.

558
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.123
I knew of you, but I didn't
know you personally.

559
00:39:10.493 --> 00:39:12.459
That's always bothered me.

560
00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:16.128
I mean, that old "in-out,
us-them" thing.

561
00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:17.596
That's the way it's been.

562
00:39:17.598 --> 00:39:18.997
I know.
It's always bothered me.

563
00:39:18.999 --> 00:39:21.432
Sure, but it's water over the dam now.

564
00:39:21.434 --> 00:39:24.735
Yeah, but it's your dam and my water.

565
00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:26.503
I got crapped on a lot of years.

566
00:39:26.505 --> 00:39:28.738
I just meant that it's in the past.

567
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.574
Well, the present is a result of the past.

568
00:39:31.576 --> 00:39:33.809
I look at my high school yearbook,

569
00:39:33.811 --> 00:39:36.912
and I don't see four fabulous years.

570
00:39:36.914 --> 00:39:39.114
Actually, what I'm reminded of
is what it feels like

571
00:39:39.116 --> 00:39:41.249
to have my underwear yanked up my ass

572
00:39:41.251 --> 00:39:43.618
by some big football player
with arms like telephone poles.

573
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.153
Okay, and where are those guys now?

574
00:39:47.756 --> 00:39:52.291
I know they're not working nights at Target.
I'll tell you that.

575
00:39:52.293 --> 00:39:55.093
Yeah. You know,

576
00:39:55.095 --> 00:39:57.095
I look at my yearbook

577
00:39:57.097 --> 00:40:00.397
and I see four fabulous years

578
00:40:01.867 --> 00:40:03.800
that are gonna be the highlight of my life.

579
00:40:03.802 --> 00:40:05.935
Here's what it's like...

580
00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:09.204
First, you feel a hand going
down the back of your pants

581
00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:10.939
and tighten around the elastic waistband...

582
00:40:10.941 --> 00:40:12.607
Highlight.

583
00:40:12.609 --> 00:40:14.442
Sometimes I'd actually see stars.

584
00:40:14.444 --> 00:40:16.143
It's not going to get any better.

585
00:40:16.145 --> 00:40:18.678
And if I was particularly unlucky,

586
00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.147
my shorts would like rip completely free

587
00:40:21.149 --> 00:40:22.548
and I would get this
really drastic fabric...

588
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.882
Jim? Do you hear me?

589
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.019
Yeah.

590
00:40:31.124 --> 00:40:35.025
I don't really care about a graphic
description of a childhood prank.

591
00:40:35.027 --> 00:40:37.360
Hey, that prank was a motif in my life.

592
00:40:41.832 --> 00:40:45.500
You know, I'm locked in this store here

593
00:40:45.502 --> 00:40:48.503
because I didn't have
the guts to steal a skirt,

594
00:40:48.505 --> 00:40:51.339
so I could get arrested
and embarrass my father

595
00:40:51.341 --> 00:40:53.908
in this stupid, desperate, childish,

596
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.076
pathetic attempt to leave home.

597
00:40:56.078 --> 00:40:58.645
And you have your underwear
yanked up your ass.

598
00:40:58.647 --> 00:41:01.581
I have my entire life yanked up my ass.

599
00:41:03.351 --> 00:41:05.517
Well, you're speaking figuratively.

600
00:41:05.519 --> 00:41:07.585
I was speaking literally.
And you're happy.

601
00:41:07.587 --> 00:41:08.886
You know, you're happy.

602
00:41:10.089 --> 00:41:11.655
I'm not happy.

603
00:41:11.657 --> 00:41:13.323
I'm working nights.

604
00:41:13.325 --> 00:41:15.825
Everybody thinks I'm a liar.

605
00:41:15.827 --> 00:41:17.526
My whole family's laughing at me.

606
00:41:17.528 --> 00:41:19.728
Reverend Harwell gave me
the finger last week.

607
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.096
Okay, okay, you're not happy,

608
00:41:21.098 --> 00:41:22.831
but at least you have
some control over your life.

609
00:41:22.833 --> 00:41:24.799
So do you.
My father controls my life.

610
00:41:25.668 --> 00:41:27.334
You're over 18.

611
00:41:27.336 --> 00:41:29.269
You can tell him to drop dead,
and get on a plane.

612
00:41:29.271 --> 00:41:30.503
So can you.

613
00:41:30.505 --> 00:41:31.637
I don't want to.

614
00:41:33.374 --> 00:41:35.240
I like living at home.

615
00:41:35.242 --> 00:41:36.541
No, you don't.

616
00:41:36.543 --> 00:41:39.410
What am I, a garden snail?

617
00:41:40.513 --> 00:41:42.513
An involuntary muscle in a janitor suit?

618
00:41:42.515 --> 00:41:44.248
I, I know what I want to do.

619
00:41:45.084 --> 00:41:46.683
What could you possibly like

620
00:41:46.685 --> 00:41:49.085
about living at home at your age?

621
00:41:49.087 --> 00:41:53.254
The meals are great. I mean, there's the...
There's cable.

622
00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.924
The accommodations
are excellent, five-star.

623
00:41:57.926 --> 00:42:00.046
What do you care if I'm
living at home or not?

624
00:42:01.195 --> 00:42:03.929
Hey, I didn't come here to irritate you.

625
00:42:03.931 --> 00:42:05.597
Well, you're beginning to.

626
00:42:08.868 --> 00:42:11.869
Great.
That's really great.

627
00:42:11.871 --> 00:42:14.872
I gotta stop saying those kinds of things.

628
00:42:14.874 --> 00:42:17.541
Those freakin' kids!
I knew I couldn't trust 'em.

629
00:42:17.543 --> 00:42:20.710
Town liar.
That's a nice rep. Nice rep.

630
00:42:20.712 --> 00:42:22.578
I bet it was Gregory, that little weasel.

631
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.446
Top secret, top secret, I tell 'em,

632
00:42:24.448 --> 00:42:26.214
and they still shoot off their mouths!

633
00:42:26.216 --> 00:42:28.282
If I'd really been a French spy,

634
00:42:28.284 --> 00:42:30.651
those little tots would've gotten me killed!

635
00:42:30.653 --> 00:42:32.619
Piano wire wrapped around my neck.

636
00:42:32.621 --> 00:42:34.287
My testicles shoved down my throat,

637
00:42:34.289 --> 00:42:36.355
a piece of dynamite stuck up my ass.

638
00:42:42.328 --> 00:42:43.693
She's so beautiful.

639
00:42:46.097 --> 00:42:47.663
And I'm the town liar.

640
00:44:31.266 --> 00:44:35.934
<i>Jim, there's no reason to lie right now.</i>

641
00:44:35.936 --> 00:44:38.436
<i>There's no one to impress.</i>

642
00:44:38.438 --> 00:44:40.137
<i>You know, I'm not impressed by a man</i>

643
00:44:40.139 --> 00:44:41.938
<i>telling me he likes living at home.</i>

644
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:45.341
Excuse me. I'm not lying,

645
00:44:45.343 --> 00:44:47.509
and I'm not trying to impress you.

646
00:44:47.511 --> 00:44:49.711
So, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

647
00:44:49.713 --> 00:44:52.180
I have to clean dead flies
out of the lighting fixtures.

648
00:44:52.182 --> 00:44:55.449
<i>Okay, okay, my error.
I apologize.</i>

649
00:44:55.451 --> 00:44:59.386
<i>It's just that I can't imagine a man,</i>

650
00:44:59.388 --> 00:45:02.755
giving up his independence,
his right to mate,

651
00:45:03.457 --> 00:45:05.290
to have a family,

652
00:45:05.292 --> 00:45:08.726
<i>to have children,
to build a life for himself,</i>

653
00:45:08.728 --> 00:45:09.960
<i>for good cooking.</i>

654
00:45:09.962 --> 00:45:11.294
Hold on.

655
00:45:11.296 --> 00:45:14.130
I have not given up my right to mate.

656
00:45:14.132 --> 00:45:16.465
I have the right to mate

657
00:45:16.467 --> 00:45:19.534
anytime I feel like mating.

658
00:45:20.236 --> 00:45:22.002
<i>You go out with someone.</i>

659
00:45:22.004 --> 00:45:23.803
You bring her home.

660
00:45:23.805 --> 00:45:25.838
You introduce her to...

661
00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.907
<i>Mom, Dad, sis, Billy,</i>

662
00:45:29.509 --> 00:45:31.141
<i>Woofie the dog.</i>

663
00:45:31.143 --> 00:45:33.042
Cocktails in the rumpus room, and then

664
00:45:33.911 --> 00:45:35.577
do it on the bunk bed?

665
00:45:37.513 --> 00:45:39.312
Let's analyze that remark.

666
00:45:39.981 --> 00:45:41.847
First, I don't have a dog,

667
00:45:41.849 --> 00:45:43.515
my brother's not named Billy,

668
00:45:43.517 --> 00:45:46.684
and I don't even have a rumpus room.
So I don't even...

669
00:45:46.686 --> 00:45:48.218
You know what I mean.

670
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:55.957
Yeah, I know what you mean.

671
00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.893
Spit on me, make me feel lousy.

672
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.066
Jim?

673
00:46:08.436 --> 00:46:10.669
You said something that wasn't true.

674
00:46:11.538 --> 00:46:13.170
No.

675
00:46:13.172 --> 00:46:17.773
No, I said that I can
have sex when I want to,

676
00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:20.609
and I do. I do.

677
00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:23.677
However, I was looking forward to a
nice, quiet evening of janitoring.

678
00:46:26.348 --> 00:46:28.388
I don't think you see what I'm getting at.

679
00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:30.783
I see what you're getting at.

680
00:46:30.785 --> 00:46:33.385
I'm a lying monk with an Oedipus complex

681
00:46:33.387 --> 00:46:34.686
and an appetite for home cooking.

682
00:46:34.688 --> 00:46:36.287
Don't forget. You're
the indecisive shoplifter.

683
00:46:36.289 --> 00:46:38.289
Yes! Exactly!

684
00:46:38.291 --> 00:46:40.457
I would do anything to be in your shoes.

685
00:46:41.126 --> 00:46:43.693
These are Darnell's shoes.

686
00:46:43.695 --> 00:46:46.328
You know, you have freedom,
and you're not using it.

687
00:46:47.531 --> 00:46:49.464
It makes me sad.

688
00:46:49.466 --> 00:46:52.033
Well, you have the collective
wealth of the entire town,

689
00:46:52.035 --> 00:46:54.802
and you're trying to get yourself arrested.
Now, that makes me sad.

690
00:46:54.804 --> 00:46:56.870
That makes me sad, too.

691
00:46:56.872 --> 00:46:58.204
That's pretty stupid.

692
00:46:58.206 --> 00:46:59.471
It's very stupid.

693
00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.706
Are you serious?

694
00:47:02.708 --> 00:47:04.974
I mean, you haven't been drinking?

695
00:47:04.976 --> 00:47:06.775
This isn't the bottle talking?

696
00:47:07.544 --> 00:47:08.876
No.

697
00:47:09.812 --> 00:47:12.545
Then why don't you just talk to the guy?

698
00:47:14.715 --> 00:47:17.615
For the same reason
that you can't leave home,

699
00:47:17.617 --> 00:47:19.616
I can't tell my father to go to hell.

700
00:47:21.219 --> 00:47:22.685
Why not?

701
00:47:25.423 --> 00:47:28.290
Because I don't want to be alone.

702
00:47:56.017 --> 00:47:57.649
Mr. McClellan?

703
00:47:59.119 --> 00:48:02.186
You ever have any family
problems, you and your daughter?

704
00:48:03.322 --> 00:48:05.354
What the hell do you think this is?

705
00:48:07.191 --> 00:48:08.590
You got a point.

706
00:48:14.464 --> 00:48:16.163
Would you go with me somewhere?

707
00:48:19.134 --> 00:48:20.766
Where?
Florida?

708
00:48:21.435 --> 00:48:23.601
Wyoming? Spain?

709
00:48:23.603 --> 00:48:25.836
It doesn't really matter,
just away somewhere.

710
00:48:27.272 --> 00:48:28.771
I'd love to.

711
00:48:29.507 --> 00:48:32.174
I just can't afford to be

712
00:48:32.176 --> 00:48:34.309
capricious and carefree like yourself.

713
00:48:34.311 --> 00:48:38.078
I, I've gotta set my sights on
something and really go for it.

714
00:48:39.147 --> 00:48:40.613
Night janitor?

715
00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:43.615
It's a beginning.
I'm looking at...

716
00:48:43.617 --> 00:48:45.249
It's an end.

717
00:48:47.786 --> 00:48:49.952
Maybe if you had,
like, a destination in mind,

718
00:48:49.954 --> 00:48:52.220
that would make all the
difference in the world.

719
00:48:53.289 --> 00:48:55.455
Why?

720
00:48:55.457 --> 00:48:57.957
Well, I'm, I'm just not

721
00:48:57.959 --> 00:49:00.326
built to aimlessly roam the world.

722
00:49:00.328 --> 00:49:02.694
I'm too conservative for that.

723
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:05.996
Well,

724
00:49:05.998 --> 00:49:08.131
I was thinking about Los Angeles.

725
00:49:11.402 --> 00:49:12.634
What for?

726
00:49:12.636 --> 00:49:13.701
Live. Work.

727
00:49:15.404 --> 00:49:17.137
At what?
Whatever.

728
00:49:17.873 --> 00:49:19.973
And what about your father?

729
00:49:21.643 --> 00:49:23.509
When I don't die,

730
00:49:23.511 --> 00:49:26.745
he'll realize that I can make it on my own.

731
00:49:26.747 --> 00:49:30.915
If I do, he'll have the satisfaction
of knowing that I can't.

732
00:49:30.917 --> 00:49:34.318
If I run and he brings me back,
or if I go back on my own,

733
00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.019
either way he's just, gonna
beat the shit out of me.

734
00:49:36.021 --> 00:49:37.754
So it doesn't really make a difference.

735
00:49:37.756 --> 00:49:39.222
What, literally?

736
00:49:42.893 --> 00:49:43.958
Yeah.

737
00:49:45.328 --> 00:49:46.660
Sad.

738
00:49:47.596 --> 00:49:48.995
Yeah, it's sad.

739
00:49:48.997 --> 00:49:51.397
Until he throws you
across the room, it's sad.

740
00:49:52.433 --> 00:49:53.999
I'm just afraid to live with him,

741
00:49:54.001 --> 00:49:55.700
and I'm afraid to
live without... You know,

742
00:49:55.702 --> 00:49:58.669
you didn't come to work to hear this stuff.
I'm really sorry.

743
00:49:58.671 --> 00:50:00.003
That's all right.

744
00:50:00.005 --> 00:50:01.237
I'm gonna clean this up.

745
00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.446
I'm, I'm just surprised.

746
00:50:11.448 --> 00:50:13.414
I thought everything was okay, you know.

747
00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:15.716
I figured you got a nice car, you got

748
00:50:15.718 --> 00:50:17.017
a nice house, you got some money.

749
00:50:17.019 --> 00:50:18.418
Everything's okay.

750
00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.186
It should be,

751
00:50:20.188 --> 00:50:21.787
but it's not.

752
00:50:21.789 --> 00:50:23.855
It's twisted, and it's distorted,

753
00:50:23.857 --> 00:50:26.524
and it can't be changed,
and it cannot be saved.

754
00:50:34.066 --> 00:50:35.465
I'll go with you.

755
00:50:40.772 --> 00:50:42.304
Really?

756
00:50:43.408 --> 00:50:44.707
Yeah.

757
00:50:46.577 --> 00:50:48.209
We have to get a car.

758
00:50:49.579 --> 00:50:51.412
Let's get through the night, first.

759
00:50:51.414 --> 00:50:52.880
I have money.

760
00:50:52.882 --> 00:50:54.047
How much?

761
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:55.715
$52,000.

762
00:50:58.186 --> 00:50:59.385
On you?

763
00:51:01.055 --> 00:51:02.820
In my purse.

764
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.099
$52,000. Wow.

765
00:51:19.335 --> 00:51:21.668
I've never seen so much money in my life.

766
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:23.969
This is more than my house cost.

767
00:51:25.339 --> 00:51:27.405
Jim,

768
00:51:27.407 --> 00:51:29.607
now that I'm spending the night,

769
00:51:29.609 --> 00:51:31.275
how can I pay you back

770
00:51:31.277 --> 00:51:33.677
for being so cold to you in high school?

771
00:51:36.515 --> 00:51:38.348
Do you need an answer right away?

772
00:51:38.616 --> 00:51:39.915
No.

773
00:51:40.851 --> 00:51:42.750
Sometime before the sun comes up.

774
00:51:46.121 --> 00:51:47.753
Well,

775
00:51:48.689 --> 00:51:50.689
you're probably not going to remember this,

776
00:51:50.924 --> 00:51:53.190
but,

777
00:51:53.192 --> 00:51:55.792
there was a homecoming dance
our sophomore year.

778
00:51:57.095 --> 00:51:58.360
Do you remember Mrs. Noble?

779
00:51:59.529 --> 00:52:02.196
Large, hairy gym teacher

780
00:52:02.198 --> 00:52:04.064
with a suspiciously cumbersome groin bulge?

781
00:52:04.066 --> 00:52:05.799
I had her for two years.

782
00:52:05.801 --> 00:52:07.300
Well, she made everybody switch partners

783
00:52:07.302 --> 00:52:08.701
because all the fat girls
were dancing together,

784
00:52:08.703 --> 00:52:10.302
and the doinks, myself included,

785
00:52:10.304 --> 00:52:11.870
were standing against the wall,

786
00:52:11.872 --> 00:52:14.072
blowing spit bubbles.
Right.

787
00:52:14.074 --> 00:52:19.844
Well, for three-quarters
of one verse of a slow song,

788
00:52:21.314 --> 00:52:22.680
we danced together.

789
00:52:24.316 --> 00:52:25.715
You reeked of Stridex.

790
00:52:26.884 --> 00:52:28.617
No, that was Larry Fry.

791
00:52:29.886 --> 00:52:31.218
I'm sorry.

792
00:52:32.487 --> 00:52:33.719
I don't remember.

793
00:52:33.721 --> 00:52:35.754
Well...

794
00:52:35.756 --> 00:52:37.689
You got your hair caught in my braces.

795
00:52:38.391 --> 00:52:39.890
I don't remember.

796
00:52:39.892 --> 00:52:41.291
Well, it's not important.

797
00:52:43.828 --> 00:52:45.260
I had...

798
00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:46.894
Well, I just always...

799
00:52:47.963 --> 00:52:49.963
Dreamed of finishing that dance.

800
00:52:53.234 --> 00:52:54.299
Okay.

801
00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:01.171
Don't, don't feel
you have to answer right away.

802
00:53:01.173 --> 00:53:04.641
It's just a small portion
of my life that's incomplete.

803
00:53:04.643 --> 00:53:06.909
I thought you were gonna say
something different.

804
00:53:13.083 --> 00:53:14.582
Well,

805
00:53:16.452 --> 00:53:18.151

You scared the crap out of me.

824
00:56:25.908 --> 00:56:28.408
I thought it was the custodian.

825
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:30.510
Jim, what are you doing in there?

826
00:56:30.512 --> 00:56:32.478
I work here now.

827
00:56:37.584 --> 00:56:39.650
You wanna let me in?

828
00:56:39.652 --> 00:56:42.819
I'd love to let you in.
I don't have the keys.

829
00:56:42.821 --> 00:56:44.654
I'm locked in
here till 7:00 a.m.

830
00:56:45.156 --> 00:56:46.688
What's going on?

831
00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:48.923
Have you seen Josie McClellan?

832
00:56:50.359 --> 00:56:52.692
Of course...

833
00:56:53.494 --> 00:56:57.094
Dark hair, green eyes, beautiful.

834
00:56:57.096 --> 00:56:58.495
Yeah. Of course.

835
00:56:58.497 --> 00:56:59.762
You seen her recently?

836
00:57:01.599 --> 00:57:05.100
Matter of fact, I just
saw her yesterday, yeah.

837
00:57:05.102 --> 00:57:07.335
We had a cup of java together.

838
00:57:07.337 --> 00:57:09.537
She come into the store?

839
00:57:09.539 --> 00:57:12.106
I don't know.
I only work nights.

840
00:57:12.108 --> 00:57:14.074
Why?
Well,

841
00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:17.043
she's missing.

842
00:57:17.045 --> 00:57:20.780
Now, I was looking around this side
of town for her and I come past.

843
00:57:20.782 --> 00:57:23.682
I seen that the outside sign's on.

844
00:57:23.684 --> 00:57:26.084
The outside sign's never on.

845
00:57:26.653 --> 00:57:28.452
Yeah. Yeah.

846
00:57:28.454 --> 00:57:30.187
Did you try the library?

847
00:57:30.189 --> 00:57:32.588
Because, you know,
maybe she fell asleep reading.

848
00:57:33.824 --> 00:57:35.557
No.

849
00:57:35.559 --> 00:57:38.860
She's probably just screwing somebody
the old man don't approve of.

850
00:57:44.633 --> 00:57:46.065
Would you know...

851
00:57:46.067 --> 00:57:50.468
If the custodian comes by
to check up on people?

852
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:53.304
No, I wouldn't think he'd do that, Jimmy.

853
00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:56.407
I feel pretty good now.

854
00:58:05.484 --> 00:58:07.183
I'm sorry, sir.

855
00:58:07.185 --> 00:58:09.485
I had to practice a little therapy.

856
00:58:10.154 --> 00:58:11.887
Boy's in his own world.

857
01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.820
Why don't we get underneath the bench?

858
01:00:50.078 --> 01:00:51.744
Do you want to get on top?

859
01:01:00.087 --> 01:01:02.320
You check the office.
I'll scope the dressing rooms.

860
01:01:02.322 --> 01:01:03.821
Right.

861
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:13.828
You're on top.

862
01:01:16.098 --> 01:01:17.464
Did you want to be on top?

863
01:01:17.466 --> 01:01:19.332
No.

864
01:01:19.334 --> 01:01:22.001
No, no, I'm fine where I am.

865
01:01:22.269 --> 01:01:23.668
Sure.

866
01:02:02.139 --> 01:02:04.072
I think he went to the back.

867
01:02:15.752 --> 01:02:17.485
Evening.

868
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:23.690
Nice.

869
01:02:23.692 --> 01:02:25.525
Excellent.

870
01:02:25.527 --> 01:02:28.827
Hey, you got a tattoo?

871
01:02:31.264 --> 01:02:32.429
No, sir.

872
01:02:32.431 --> 01:02:33.997
Not you, asshole!

873
01:02:33.999 --> 01:02:36.065
I'm a missing person.

874
01:02:36.067 --> 01:02:38.700
The whole town is looking for me.

875
01:02:38.702 --> 01:02:41.669
What, are you hidin' out?
Yes.

876
01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:44.038
And I would appreciate
it if you'd let us sit up.

877
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.939
What about the tattoo?

878
01:02:46.775 --> 01:02:48.841
I don't have one.

879
01:02:48.843 --> 01:02:50.175
You owe me a buck.

880
01:02:50.177 --> 01:02:51.609
Actually, it's up to two.

881
01:02:51.611 --> 01:02:54.445
I borrowed that one off you at Burger King.

882
01:02:54.447 --> 01:02:56.079
Excuse me.

883
01:02:57.615 --> 01:03:00.015
Are you planning to shoot us
in the back of the head?

884
01:03:00.017 --> 01:03:02.750
We haven't decided yet, have we?

885
01:03:04.353 --> 01:03:05.752
Who are you?

886
01:03:05.754 --> 01:03:08.521
You don't want to know.

887
01:03:08.523 --> 01:03:10.956
He wouldn't have asked if he
didn't want to know, butthead.

888
01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:12.924
He's a little crazy.
He's my brother.

889
01:03:12.926 --> 01:03:14.926
He's not quite right.
That's not true.

890
01:03:15.428 --> 01:03:16.860
She doesn't even know me.

891
01:03:16.862 --> 01:03:18.428
Somebody better start talking straight here.

892
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:19.929
That's the truth.

893
01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:22.129
Okay.

894
01:03:24.366 --> 01:03:25.965
You want to know?

895
01:03:27.034 --> 01:03:28.933
Okay, good.

896
01:03:29.368 --> 01:03:31.134
But...

897
01:03:32.303 --> 01:03:34.336
Come on over here.

898
01:03:35.205 --> 01:03:37.738
- What?
- Come on over.

899
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.706
Come on over here! Over here.

900
01:03:57.324 --> 01:03:59.123
Come on down here.

901
01:04:02.094 --> 01:04:03.854
That's right.
Down here. Down here.

902
01:04:06.764 --> 01:04:08.130
Okay.

903
01:04:09.666 --> 01:04:12.133
You dumb sons of bitches.

904
01:04:13.136 --> 01:04:16.170
Do you realize that you have just walked

905
01:04:16.172 --> 01:04:19.739
straight into a $60-million
drug transaction?

906
01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:23.774
So, you're running this

907
01:04:23.776 --> 01:04:27.277
multi-zillion-dollar
drug transaction by yourself?

908
01:04:27.279 --> 01:04:29.112
Little Target boy.

909
01:04:29.114 --> 01:04:31.247
No.

910
01:04:31.249 --> 01:04:33.916
No, I'm not doing it by myself.

911
01:04:33.918 --> 01:04:35.550
No, no.

912
01:04:36.786 --> 01:04:38.218
As a matter of fact,

913
01:04:39.754 --> 01:04:41.754
in about 10 minutes,

914
01:04:41.756 --> 01:04:44.957
this place is gonna be
alive with the meanest,

915
01:04:44.959 --> 01:04:48.527
ugliest, most impatient animals
you guys have ever seen.

916
01:04:48.529 --> 01:04:51.930
So I'll tell you what, I'll
give you five minutes to take

917
01:04:51.932 --> 01:04:54.632
whatever you want in the whole store.
Anything you want and just go.

918
01:04:54.634 --> 01:04:57.600
I won't tell. Just go. Just
take your guns and go. Scoot.

919
01:04:58.336 --> 01:05:00.068
Okay, then, who's the girl?

920
01:05:02.439 --> 01:05:03.671
I'm his hostage.

921
01:05:03.673 --> 01:05:04.838
Yes, yes.

922
01:05:05.941 --> 01:05:08.942
Is that true?

923
01:05:08.944 --> 01:05:11.344
Yes! Yes, it's true.

924
01:05:11.779 --> 01:05:13.545
And...

925
01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:18.750
If the deal doesn't go down,

926
01:05:19.385 --> 01:05:20.784
she becomes pig feed.

927
01:05:20.786 --> 01:05:21.951
Bullshit.

928
01:05:22.386 --> 01:05:23.852
Really?

929
01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:28.022
Well, blow her away.

930
01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:30.124
Come on, that's bullshit!

931
01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.892
Okay.

932
01:05:34.295 --> 01:05:37.728
Then give me your guns
and I'll do it for you.

933
01:05:38.897 --> 01:05:40.029
It's bullshit, right?

934
01:05:41.665 --> 01:05:43.097
We'll see.

935
01:05:45.701 --> 01:05:47.333
Roll over.

936
01:05:47.335 --> 01:05:48.834
Come on, you heard him.
What?

937
01:05:48.836 --> 01:05:50.869
Roll over!
That's right. You too, honey.

938
01:05:50.871 --> 01:05:53.238
You heard me.
Roll over. Come on, do it!

939
01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.974
Come on, come on! Roll! Roll.
That's it. Very good.

940
01:05:56.976 --> 01:06:00.310
Yeah.

941
01:06:00.312 --> 01:06:03.246
Give me the guns.

942
01:06:04.983 --> 01:06:06.515
No way, man..

943
01:06:06.517 --> 01:06:08.250
Fine. Fine.

944
01:06:08.252 --> 01:06:10.385
You do it. I don't
need her anymore, anyway.

945
01:06:11.721 --> 01:06:13.420
I only needed her to get through customs.

946
01:06:13.422 --> 01:06:15.088
I don't like this.

947
01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:16.756
This sucks. It's not worth it.

948
01:06:16.758 --> 01:06:18.324
Come on, we don't
have much time. Do it!

949
01:06:18.326 --> 01:06:19.758
All right.

950
01:06:23.597 --> 01:06:25.330
It's nothing personal.

951
01:06:25.332 --> 01:06:27.092
Jim!
Too late. They're here!

952
01:06:29.001 --> 01:06:30.500
It's too late. They're here.

953
01:06:30.502 --> 01:06:32.262
Men, hold your fire.
Hold the fire.

954
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:34.769
Ned in housewares, hold your fire.

955
01:06:34.771 --> 01:06:36.570
Tommy in sporting goods, hold your fire.

956
01:06:36.572 --> 01:06:37.904
Ned, hold your fire.

957
01:06:37.906 --> 01:06:40.273
There are infrared scopes
trained on your heads.

958
01:06:40.275 --> 01:06:41.841
We didn't want this!

959
01:06:41.843 --> 01:06:43.523
It's the girl you want, not us!

960
01:06:44.412 --> 01:06:45.844
Just relax, okay.
Ned, we got a WD-40.

961
01:06:45.846 --> 01:06:47.345
That's right.
A full-scale PMS.

962
01:06:47.347 --> 01:06:49.046
Okay, everybody, just relax!

963
01:06:49.048 --> 01:06:51.915
Now, now, everybody just relax.

964
01:06:51.917 --> 01:06:53.683
Okay, the whole place is gonna blow.

965
01:06:53.685 --> 01:06:54.850
Everybody just relax.

966
01:06:54.852 --> 01:06:56.685
Now, put down your guns.
Put the guns down.

967
01:06:56.687 --> 01:06:58.219
Ned, they're putting down the guns.

968
01:06:58.221 --> 01:06:59.920
Are you putting them down?
They are putting them down.

969
01:06:59.922 --> 01:07:02.355
Now, get down, 'cause
lives are at stake here.

970
01:07:02.357 --> 01:07:05.757
Let go. Let go, let go.
Now, get back, get back.

971
01:07:07.193 --> 01:07:10.627
Spread 'em. Spread the legs.
Put down the dogs.

972
01:07:10.629 --> 01:07:13.196
Okay, put the dogs down.
Put the dogs down.

973
01:07:13.198 --> 01:07:15.631
Both of 'em!
Put the dogs down! Down!

974
01:07:17.368 --> 01:07:19.234
That was great!

975
01:07:19.236 --> 01:07:20.969
I got a big surprise for you guys.

976
01:07:20.971 --> 01:07:23.804
We have a bit of a surprise for you, too.

977
01:07:25.308 --> 01:07:27.074
Them guns aren't loaded.

978
01:07:37.551 --> 01:07:39.350
I got an idea.

979
01:07:39.352 --> 01:07:41.318
How about a truce?

980
01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.321
I'm full of shit.
You're full of shit.

981
01:07:44.323 --> 01:07:47.057
I think everybody at one time
in their life is full of shit.

982
01:07:47.059 --> 01:07:48.658
I'll throw on a couple of corn dogs

983
01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.760
and we'll all get to know each other.

984
01:07:50.762 --> 01:07:53.062
I'd like to know what
goes on inside your heads.

985
01:07:53.064 --> 01:07:55.364
Okay, you had the big one, you had the...

986
01:07:55.366 --> 01:07:57.032
No.

987
01:07:57.034 --> 01:07:58.914
Sorry. I could've
sworn you had the big one.

988
01:08:03.072 --> 01:08:05.105
I lied.

989
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:11.943
These are the men that
killed that guy in Saltburg.

990
01:08:13.046 --> 01:08:15.413
I'm fairly sure that we're gonna die.

991
01:08:15.415 --> 01:08:17.214
I just want to tell
you how disappointed I am

992
01:08:17.216 --> 01:08:19.015
that we're not going to California together.

993
01:08:19.017 --> 01:08:20.750
We're not dead yet.

994
01:08:21.853 --> 01:08:24.520
Pretty darn close.
No.

995
01:08:24.522 --> 01:08:27.122
If I can get them to take me with them,

996
01:08:27.124 --> 01:08:29.524
maybe I can get away and come back for you.

997
01:08:29.526 --> 01:08:32.259
Don't forget we need a car
and they obviously have one.

998
01:08:33.629 --> 01:08:35.562
Just...

999
01:08:35.564 --> 01:08:36.963
Go along with whatever I do, okay?

1000
01:08:36.965 --> 01:08:38.331
Okay.

1001
01:08:50.711 --> 01:08:52.744
So, what's the word on you two?

1002
01:08:52.746 --> 01:08:56.447
Are you married?
Obviously, you're...

1003
01:08:56.449 --> 01:08:59.716
Hack crooks if you can't pull
off a discount store job.

1004
01:09:01.786 --> 01:09:04.453
What were you planning to steal?
A little hair spray?

1005
01:09:08.957 --> 01:09:10.022
Sorry.

1006
01:09:14.227 --> 01:09:15.459
Lady, you got a job?

1007
01:09:17.563 --> 01:09:19.062
No.

1008
01:09:19.064 --> 01:09:20.463
Well, then don't knock ours.

1009
01:09:21.432 --> 01:09:23.565
Crime isn't a job.
It's a sickness.

1010
01:09:28.571 --> 01:09:29.903
Whoops.

1011
01:09:30.805 --> 01:09:32.070
Anyone have some change?

1012
01:09:43.949 --> 01:09:46.916
You look like a lady in need of a quarter.

1013
01:09:46.918 --> 01:09:49.250
I might need more than just a quarter.

1014
01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:54.621
You know...
No.

1015
01:09:54.623 --> 01:09:56.489
You and I could make a lot of money.

1016
01:09:56.491 --> 01:09:59.425
Honey, me and Nestor are partners.

1017
01:09:59.427 --> 01:10:01.527
Okay? We don't need a third.

1018
01:10:01.529 --> 01:10:04.062
You don't know what you need,
so why don't you shut up?

1019
01:10:07.467 --> 01:10:09.500
Hop on.

1020
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.346
Now.

1021
01:10:27.981 --> 01:10:29.714
Let's go now.

1022
01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:32.382
Know what you are?

1023
01:10:32.384 --> 01:10:33.516
Yeah.

1024
01:10:33.518 --> 01:10:36.418
You are one
good-looking ball of trouble.

1025
01:10:39.623 --> 01:10:40.855
Good.

1026
01:11:18.027 --> 01:11:19.493
What do you think, for the car?

1027
01:11:19.495 --> 01:11:21.061
This one?

1028
01:11:21.063 --> 01:11:24.330
No, the whole thing. We'll
just lay it down in the back.

1029
01:11:24.332 --> 01:11:26.398
We got
multi-cassette capabilities.

1030
01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.899
Think of the sound.

1031
01:11:55.227 --> 01:11:58.361
Let me just tell you. I'm not
helping you load your car.

1032
01:11:58.363 --> 01:12:00.229
Think again, boy.

1033
01:12:00.231 --> 01:12:04.032
You're not going to take the stolen
merchandise out of the store. No.

1034
01:12:04.034 --> 01:12:05.199
I'm not gonna let you.

1035
01:12:05.201 --> 01:12:06.700
Get out.

1036
01:12:06.702 --> 01:12:07.867
It's stolen. All of it!

1037
01:12:07.869 --> 01:12:09.034
- Give me that!
- No!

1038
01:12:09.036 --> 01:12:11.036
It's mine!
Give it to me!

1039
01:12:11.038 --> 01:12:12.370
It's mine.

1040
01:12:16.808 --> 01:12:19.108
But where... Wait a minute.

1041
01:12:22.546 --> 01:12:23.878
You're not going with them?

1042
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.145
Yeah.

1043
01:12:26.214 --> 01:12:27.946
You'll be an accessory.

1044
01:12:29.549 --> 01:12:31.715
So?

1045
01:12:31.717 --> 01:12:33.717
So? You don't know
anything about them.

1046
01:12:33.719 --> 01:12:35.719
You certainly don't know anything about him.

1047
01:12:35.721 --> 01:12:37.220
These are hardened criminals here!

1048
01:12:37.222 --> 01:12:39.322
Okay, come here. That's enough.
That's enough!

1049
01:12:39.324 --> 01:12:40.389
Gil.

1050
01:12:42.793 --> 01:12:45.460
Don't waste your time.
You could get a hernia.

1051
01:12:45.462 --> 01:12:47.628
You know, if my foot could talk,

1052
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:50.631
it would say, "May I please
go up this geek's ass?"

1053
01:12:50.633 --> 01:12:51.832
Forget him!
Forget him.

1054
01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:53.466
Come on! All right.

1055
01:12:53.468 --> 01:12:56.235
He's no use to us. After all,
the guy's built like an oyster.

1056
01:12:56.237 --> 01:12:57.802
Listen, little mister.

1057
01:13:00.439 --> 01:13:02.105
If you tell on us,

1058
01:13:02.107 --> 01:13:03.473
I'll kill you.

1059
01:13:09.446 --> 01:13:10.711
Fine.

1060
01:13:15.783 --> 01:13:17.649
Jim.

1061
01:13:26.158 --> 01:13:27.757
Don't be an ass.

1062
01:13:30.428 --> 01:13:32.994
Okay, Jimbo?

1063
01:13:35.098 --> 01:13:36.897
Let's go, shall we?

1064
01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.259
Come on, come on, come on!

1065
01:14:26.841 --> 01:14:29.374
I got 'em.
I got 'em. I got 'em.

1066
01:15:52.723 --> 01:15:55.490
<i>That wasn't a store robbery.</i>

1067
01:15:55.492 --> 01:15:57.825
<i>That was an assassination.</i>

1068
01:15:57.827 --> 01:15:59.893
That wasn't a clerk.
That was a wise guy.

1069
01:16:00.729 --> 01:16:02.829
How do I know?

1070
01:16:02.831 --> 01:16:06.165
I spent a little time with the
FBI's organized crime unit.

1071
01:16:06.167 --> 01:16:08.133
I guess you could say that
I'm intimately knowledgeable

1072
01:16:08.135 --> 01:16:10.001
with the seedy and rancorous
workings of the mob

1073
01:16:10.003 --> 01:16:12.770
in the Midwest section of this country.

1074
01:16:12.772 --> 01:16:15.639
<i>Let me just say, I know a
gangland slaying when I see one,</i>

1075
01:16:15.641 --> 01:16:17.641
<i>and that's exactly what this baby is.</i>

1076
01:16:19.277 --> 01:16:23.012
<i>I'd look into myself personally,
but I got a date tonight.</i>

1077
01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:33.553
Attention Target shoppers.

1078
01:17:21.398 --> 01:17:22.830
Jim!

1079
01:18:17.786 --> 01:18:20.353
He is so cool.
