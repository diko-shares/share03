1
00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:39.849
Help! Someone help me!

2
00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:44.770
Is someone there?

3
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.565
Hey!

4
00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:52.278
Oh, shit. I'm probably dead.

5
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:54.697
- You're not dead.
- Who's that?

6
00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:57.575
Who's that?

7
00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:00.411
There's no point in yelling.
I already tried that.

8
00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:01.787
Turn on the lights!

9
00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:04.373
I would if I could.

10
00:02:05.207 --> 00:02:07.460
What the fuck is going on?
Where am I?

11
00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:09.712
I don't know yet.

12
00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:11.505
What is that smell?

13
00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:16.177
Shh. Hang on a second.
I think I found something.

14
00:03:02.973 --> 00:03:04.350
Holy shit.

15
00:03:20.908 --> 00:03:22.034
Help!

16
00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:25.246
Help!

17
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.083
Help!

18
00:03:30.584 --> 00:03:31.711
Help!

19
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:34.672
No one can hear you.

20
00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:37.508
What the fuck is this?

21
00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:39.343
Calm down. Just calm down.

22
00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:42.555
Are you hurt?

23
00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.975
I don't know. Yeah!

24
00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:47.268
What's your name?

25
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.271
My name is very fucking confused.

26
00:03:50.354 --> 00:03:52.398
What's your name?
What's going on here?

27
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:55.151
My name is Lawrence Gordon.
I'm a doctor.

28
00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:57.319
I just woke up here, just like you.

29
00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:11.000
Recognize him?

30
00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.085
No.

31
00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:18.466
Well, do you have any idea
how you got here?

32
00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.717
No.

33
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.552
What's the last thing you remember?

34
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.680
Nothing. I went to bed
in my shithole apartment

35
00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:27.183
and woke up in an actual shithole.

36
00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:31.896
What about you, huh?

37
00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:36.108
There's... there's not much to tell.

38
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.281
I was on my way home from work, and...
I don't remember anything else.

39
00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:50.331
First dead body I've ever seen.

40
00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:52.458
Look different in real life.

41
00:04:54.418 --> 00:04:56.086
They don't move.

42
00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.469
From the looks of these chains,

43
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:05.846
someone didn't want us
to go very far, either.

44
00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:09.892
Do you see any scars?

45
00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:11.101
- What?
- Huh?

46
00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:13.354
This is what they do, man!
They kidnap you and drug you.

47
00:05:13.437 --> 00:05:14.897
Before you know it,
you're lying in a bathtub,

48
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.357
and your kidneys are on eBay.

49
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.068
No one has taken your kidneys.

50
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:20.778
How can you tell from way over there?

51
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:23.656
Because you'd either be in terrible agony

52
00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:26.742
or you'd be dead by now.
Trust me.

53
00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.161
- What are you, a surgeon?
- Yeah.

54
00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.290
So...

55
00:05:34.708 --> 00:05:37.336
you gonna tell me your name or what?

56
00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:42.466
Adam.

57
00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:45.261
Well, Adam...

58
00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:48.514
What we need to do...

59
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:52.434
is start thinking about why we're here.

60
00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:57.314
Whoever brought us here could have
killed us by now, but they didn't.

61
00:05:58.357 --> 00:05:59.942
They must want something from us.

62
00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:03.737
The question is what.

63
00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.204
- That clock.
- What about it?

64
00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:13.497
It's brand-new.

65
00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:15.249
SQ?

66
00:06:15.332 --> 00:06:19.336
So... somebody obviously
wanted us to know the time.

67
00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:25.801
Wait. I think I might be able
to reach the door.

68
00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:52.995
What is that?

69
00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:57.750
Excuse me.

70
00:06:58.792 --> 00:06:59.835
It's a tape.

71
00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.838
- Well, where'd you find it?
- It was in my pocket.

72
00:07:11.555 --> 00:07:13.182
It says, "Play me."

73
00:07:45.714 --> 00:07:46.715
Come on. Come on.

74
00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:50.427
Throw it over here.

75
00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:53.597
Huh?

76
00:08:11.865 --> 00:08:13.033
No?

77
00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:40.436
Use your shirt.

78
00:08:41.937 --> 00:08:43.856
- What?
- Your shirt.

79
00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:00.664
Come on.

80
00:09:05.377 --> 00:09:06.670
It won't work.

81
00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:09.923
Well, look around. There--
there must be something else you can use.

82
00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:11.550
There's nothing.

83
00:09:11.633 --> 00:09:13.260
Well, there must be something.

84
00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:28.776
Come on. You can do it.

85
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.656
Come on. Come on.

86
00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:35.908
Again.

87
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:01.266
<i>Rise and shine, Adam.</i>

88
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.811
<i>You're probably wondering where you are.</i>

89
00:10:03.894 --> 00:10:05.646
<i>I'll tell you where you might be.</i>

90
00:10:06.188 --> 00:10:08.857
<i>You might be in the room that you die in.</i>

91
00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:12.611
<i>Up until now,
you've simply sat in the shadows,</i>

92
00:10:12.694 --> 00:10:15.322
<i>watching others live out their lives.</i>

93
00:10:15.405 --> 00:10:19.618
<i>But what do voyeurs see
when they look into the mirror?</i>

94
00:10:19.701 --> 00:10:25.916
<i>Now, I see you as a strange mix
of someone angry yet apathetic,</i>

95
00:10:25.999 --> 00:10:27.543
<i>but mostly just pathetic.</i>

96
00:10:28.168 --> 00:10:31.547
<i>So, are you going to watch
yourself die today, Adam,</i>

97
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.257
<i>or do something about it?</i>

98
00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:36.093
I don't get it.

99
00:10:37.594 --> 00:10:38.595
Throw me the player.

100
00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:41.682
No.

101
00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:43.767
You throw me your tape.

102
00:10:45.018 --> 00:10:48.480
Look, we're gonna have to work together
if we want to get out of here.

103
00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:49.857
Now just throw it to me.

104
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.441
I'm not gonna risk breaking it.

105
00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:52.943
You throw me your tape.

106
00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:11.795
<i>Dr. Gordon...</i>

107
00:11:12.546 --> 00:11:14.298
<i>this is your wake-up call.</i>

108
00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:17.217
<i>Every day of your working life,</i>

109
00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:21.388
<i>you have given people the news
that they're going to die soon.</i>

110
00:11:21.471 --> 00:11:24.850
<i>Now you will be the cause of death.</i>

111
00:11:25.517 --> 00:11:28.687
<i>Your aim in this game is to kill Adam.</i>

112
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.565
<i>You have until 6:00 on the clock to do it.</i>

113
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:35.360
<i>There's a man in the room with you.</i>

114
00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:37.905
<i>When there's that much
poison in your blood,</i>

115
00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:41.742
<i>the only thing left to do
is shoot yourself.</i>

116
00:11:47.539 --> 00:11:51.793
<i>There are ways to win this
hidden all around you.</i>

117
00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:57.007
<i>Just remember,
marks the spot for the treasure.</i>

118
00:11:57.466 --> 00:12:01.261
<i>If you do not kill Adam by 6:00,</i>

119
00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:05.265
<i>then Alison and Diana will die,
Dr. Gordon...</i>

120
00:12:06.099 --> 00:12:09.561
<i>and I'll leave you in this room to rot.</i>

121
00:12:10.687 --> 00:12:12.564
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

122
00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:24.284
Give me that.

123
00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:26.495
Now.

124
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.258
<i>Then Alison and Diana will die,
Dr. Gordon...</i>

125
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:42.261
<i>and I'll leave you in this room to rot.</i>

126
00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:44.179
Any idea who that is?

127
00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.181
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

128
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.185
- He knows us.
- Wait a minute.

129
00:12:51.561 --> 00:12:52.562
What do you think?

130
00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:55.649
- Probably a joke, right?
- Shh! Shh!

131
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.776
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

132
00:12:57.859 --> 00:12:59.319
Listen. Listen.

133
00:13:00.821 --> 00:13:02.447
<i>Follow your heart.</i>

134
00:13:10.163 --> 00:13:12.457
What the hell does
"follow your heart" mean?

135
00:13:19.047 --> 00:13:21.758
There, right next to you, on the toilet.

136
00:13:31.852 --> 00:13:33.061
Come on. Come on.

137
00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:40.360
Oh, man.

138
00:13:48.452 --> 00:13:49.911
Anything?

139
00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:51.204
No solids.

140
00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:52.622
Take off the lid.

141
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:56.168
Come on.

142
00:14:06.803 --> 00:14:08.930
I really wish I had
checked in there first.

143
00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:12.142
What is it?

144
00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:41.338
Hey.

145
00:14:42.964 --> 00:14:44.466
Mind passing me the other one?

146
00:15:10.742 --> 00:15:12.452
Fuck. Fuck!

147
00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:13.995
Fuck!

148
00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:59.166
He doesn't want us
to cut through our chains.

149
00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:03.462
He wants us to cut through our feet.

150
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.676
I think I may know who's done this to us.

151
00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:11.470
What did you say?

152
00:16:11.553 --> 00:16:13.305
Well, it's--
it's not someone I know personally.

153
00:16:13.388 --> 00:16:17.017
It's... just someone I know of.

154
00:16:17.934 --> 00:16:21.062
Jesus Christ. Tell me. Who is it?

155
00:16:22.772 --> 00:16:23.773
Last I heard...

156
00:16:25.942 --> 00:16:27.736
police still hadn't caught him.

157
00:16:28.778 --> 00:16:33.033
<i>And the only reason I know that
is because I was a suspect.</i>

158
00:16:35.952 --> 00:16:37.329
<i>I'll start from the beginning.</i>

159
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.796
This one's not fresh anymore.

160
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.590
At least three weeks out.

161
00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:52.344
Victim's a 46-year-old male.

162
00:16:54.763 --> 00:16:58.558
Died of massive blood loss,
mostly through the femoral artery.

163
00:17:02.479 --> 00:17:03.897
He started at the back of the cage

164
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.066
and tunneled his way
through that razor wire so fast

165
00:17:06.149 --> 00:17:08.485
it's amazing he got as far as he did.

166
00:17:10.403 --> 00:17:13.990
Cut himself so deep, we found traces
of stomach acid on the floor.

167
00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:20.288
We also found this.

168
00:17:24.417 --> 00:17:30.090
<i>Hello, Paul. You are a perfectly healthy,
sane, middle-class male,</i>

169
00:17:30.173 --> 00:17:34.386
<i>yet last month, you ran a straight razor
across your wrist.</i>

170
00:17:35.053 --> 00:17:38.557
<i>Did you cut yourself
because you truly wanted to die,</i>

171
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.184
<i>or did you just want some attention?</i>

172
00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:43.353
<i>Tonight, you'll show me.</i>

173
00:17:43.895 --> 00:17:48.858
<i>The irony is that if you want to die,
you just have to stay where you are,</i>

174
00:17:48.942 --> 00:17:52.028
<i>but if you want to live,
you'll have to cut yourself again.</i>

175
00:17:52.737 --> 00:17:55.991
<i>Find a path through
the razor wire to the door.</i>

176
00:17:56.324 --> 00:18:00.287
<i>But hurry, At 3:00, that door will lock,</i>

177
00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.373
<i>and then this room becomes your tomb.</i>

178
00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:06.793
<i>How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Paul?</i>

179
00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:12.424
Door was on a timer.

180
00:18:12.507 --> 00:18:14.509
It was unlocked until 3:00.

181
00:18:15.218 --> 00:18:16.219
Then it slammed shut.

182
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:18.680
He was given two hours.

183
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.650
A jigsaw piece.

184
00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:39.242
I think we're gonna be here
for a while, Sing.

185
00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:41.369
<i>The newspapers started calling him</i>

186
00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:42.996
the Jigsaw Killer.

187
00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:49.085
Actually, technically speaking,
he's not really a murderer.

188
00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.797
He never killed anyone.

189
00:18:52.881 --> 00:18:55.925
<i>He finds ways for his victims
to kill themselves.</i>

190
00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:00.347
<i>Hello,</i> Mark.

191
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:05.268
<i>If you're so sick, then why do I have
so many photos of you up and about?</i>

192
00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:09.689
<i>Let's put your so-called
illness to the test.</i>

193
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.277
<i>Right now, there's a slow-acting
poison in your veins.</i>

194
00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:17.364
<i>The antidote is inside the safe.</i>

195
00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:19.074
Help!

196
00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:20.825
<i>The combination to the safe...</i>

197
00:19:22.243 --> 00:19:23.745
<i>is written on the wall.</i>

198
00:19:24.537 --> 00:19:27.624
<i>Hurry up and program it in,
but watch your step.</i>

199
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:31.378
<i>And by the way,
that's a flammable substance</i>

200
00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:33.046
<i>smeared on your body.</i>

201
00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:36.466
<i>So I would be careful
with that candle, if I were you.</i>

202
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:37.759
Help!

203
00:19:37.842 --> 00:19:40.178
<i>Or all the people
you've burned with your act</i>

204
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:42.097
<i>just might have their revenge.</i>

205
00:19:49.896 --> 00:19:51.314
I found something else.

206
00:19:51.606 --> 00:19:53.608
Well, two things, actually.

207
00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:57.445
There was someone standing outside here,
watching through this peephole.

208
00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:59.447
Looks like our friend Jigsaw
likes to book himself

209
00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:02.075
front-row seats
to his own sick little games.

210
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.536
He was there at the last one as well.

211
00:20:05.578 --> 00:20:09.249
Only this time...
he left us his penlight.

212
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:17.757
Get a rush on the prints.

213
00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:18.967
Copy that.

214
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.721
OK, this patient has an inoperable
frontal-lobe tumor

215
00:20:22.804 --> 00:20:24.305
extending across the midline.

216
00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:26.558
It started as colon cancer.

217
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.894
Patient has come in
for a standard checkup,

218
00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:34.274
by which we are able to monitor the rate
at which his condition is declining.

219
00:20:34.357 --> 00:20:35.734
The patient had--

220
00:20:35.817 --> 00:20:36.776
His name is John...

221
00:20:37.986 --> 00:20:39.028
Dr. Gordon.

222
00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:41.990
He's a very interesting person.

223
00:20:43.908 --> 00:20:45.869
Thank you for that information, Zep.

224
00:20:45.952 --> 00:20:50.248
As you can see, our orderlies form
very special bonds with the patients.

225
00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:53.918
Continuing on, the patient had--

226
00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:56.212
<i>Dr. Lawrence Gordon,
please page the operator.</i>

227
00:20:57.797 --> 00:21:00.633
Obviously, someone doesn't want me
to tell you what the patient had.

228
00:21:00.717 --> 00:21:01.885
Excuse me.

229
00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:10.435
Dr. Gordon. I'm Detective Tapp.

230
00:21:10.518 --> 00:21:12.645
This is Detective Sing. City Homicide.

231
00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:14.564
Very impressive.

232
00:21:14.647 --> 00:21:16.733
Oh, thank you.

233
00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:18.902
I do my best.

234
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.615
Sorry to interrupt you
while you're working.

235
00:21:23.698 --> 00:21:26.534
It's fine. Now, how can
I help you gentlemen?

236
00:21:27.327 --> 00:21:29.454
Are you able to tell us
where you were between the hours

237
00:21:29.537 --> 00:21:32.373
of 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m.
last night, Doctor?

238
00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:35.335
Why is it that you're interested?

239
00:21:35.835 --> 00:21:37.962
We'd like to ask you
a few questions about it.

240
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.717
For your sake, I think it's best
if we do it down at the station.

241
00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:44.552
Would you like to follow us there?

242
00:21:45.762 --> 00:21:47.931
I'm afraid that's quite
out of the question.

243
00:21:48.014 --> 00:21:50.308
I can't just leave.
I have work to do, and--

244
00:21:50.391 --> 00:21:51.810
Plus, my wife has the car today, so--

245
00:21:51.893 --> 00:21:53.895
That's OK. You can ride with us...

246
00:21:54.729 --> 00:21:55.647
Doc.

247
00:22:02.111 --> 00:22:03.238
I'm sorry.

248
00:22:03.321 --> 00:22:06.032
You'll have to tell me again.
What is this all about?

249
00:22:07.867 --> 00:22:09.202
Is this yours, Doctor?

250
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.969
So, you have no idea how your penlight
showed up at the murder scene?

251
00:22:26.052 --> 00:22:27.637
Of course not, Brett.

252
00:22:30.598 --> 00:22:32.267
Well, I have to ask...

253
00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:34.394
what were you doing last night?

254
00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:38.898
I was seeing someone.

255
00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:41.818
Who?

256
00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:48.199
Look, if you can't be honest with me--

257
00:22:48.283 --> 00:22:50.326
I was visiting someone.
It wasn't a patient.

258
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:51.619
All right?

259
00:22:55.456 --> 00:22:56.708
What am I gonna do?

260
00:22:56.791 --> 00:22:59.419
Well, as your lawyer and your friend,

261
00:22:59.502 --> 00:23:03.381
my advice to you is to bite the bullet
and give them your alibi now,

262
00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:06.718
'cause no one's gonna believe you later.

263
00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:14.183
That was five months ago.

264
00:23:18.021 --> 00:23:19.772
He tried to set me up for murder.

265
00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:25.111
OK.

266
00:23:26.779 --> 00:23:28.907
We checked your alibi. It holds up.

267
00:23:29.324 --> 00:23:31.951
Good. Can I go home now?

268
00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:35.330
We have one of the victims
who managed to escape.

269
00:23:35.955 --> 00:23:38.166
We want to know if you
wouldn't mind sticking around

270
00:23:38.249 --> 00:23:40.251
and listening to her testimony.

271
00:23:40.668 --> 00:23:42.462
Maybe it'll trigger something.

272
00:23:42.545 --> 00:23:45.715
- I'd like to help, really, but--
- Well, we'd really appreciate it.

273
00:23:46.674 --> 00:23:49.093
- She's the only one who made it.
- OK.

274
00:23:55.099 --> 00:23:56.392
Amanda...

275
00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.312
in your own time...

276
00:24:00.355 --> 00:24:02.857
tell me the first thing you remember.

277
00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:22.251
<i>I woke up.
All I could taste was blood...</i>

278
00:24:23.419 --> 00:24:24.921
<i>And metal.</i>

279
00:24:53.908 --> 00:24:55.410
Hello, Amanda.

280
00:24:56.577 --> 00:24:59.831
<i>You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

281
00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:01.958
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

282
00:25:02.709 --> 00:25:04.877
<i>Here's what happens if you lose.</i>

283
00:25:05.878 --> 00:25:09.966
<i>The device you're wearing is hooked into
your upper and lower jaws.</i>

284
00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:12.969
<i>When the timer on the back goes off,</i>

285
00:25:13.052 --> 00:25:16.556
<i>your mouth will be
permanently ripped open.</i>

286
00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:20.101
<i>Think of it like a reverse bear trap.</i>

287
00:25:20.184 --> 00:25:22.645
<i>Here, I'll show you.</i>

288
00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:38.161
<i>There's only one key to open the device.</i>

289
00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:41.247
<i>It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.</i>

290
00:25:43.082 --> 00:25:44.667
<i>Look around, Amanda.</i>

291
00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:46.586
<i>Know that I'm not lying.</i>

292
00:25:47.003 --> 00:25:48.629
<i>You better hurry up.</i>

293
00:25:49.297 --> 00:25:53.051
<i>Live or die. Make your choice.</i>

294
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.488
No!

295
00:26:31.464 --> 00:26:33.257
And then I saw the body.

296
00:26:57.073 --> 00:26:58.658
There was a knife.

297
00:27:31.732 --> 00:27:34.360
He'd been injected with
an opiate overdose.

298
00:27:35.611 --> 00:27:38.364
Couldn't move or feel much of anything.

299
00:27:40.449 --> 00:27:43.077
You mean... he was alive?

300
00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:44.370
Was.

301
00:27:46.122 --> 00:27:48.082
What happened after you took it off?

302
00:28:50.394 --> 00:28:53.981
<i>Congratulations. You are still alive.</i>

303
00:28:54.941 --> 00:29:00.154
<i>Most people are so ungrateful
to be alive, but not you.</i>

304
00:29:00.321 --> 00:29:02.073
<i>Not anymore.</i>

305
00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.249
You are, in fact, a drug addict.

306
00:29:11.332 --> 00:29:13.084
Isn't that right, Mandy?

307
00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:17.546
Do you think that is why he picked you?

308
00:29:24.387 --> 00:29:26.389
Are you grateful, Mandy?

309
00:29:31.602 --> 00:29:32.603
He...

310
00:29:33.437 --> 00:29:35.189
helped me.

311
00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:14.812
Are you sure it's him?

312
00:30:16.689 --> 00:30:18.274
Yeah, I'm sure.

313
00:30:18.357 --> 00:30:20.484
How do I know you're telling the truth?

314
00:30:21.193 --> 00:30:23.362
You could be the one
who put me in this room!

315
00:30:23.446 --> 00:30:27.116
I'm in exactly the same situation
that you're in.

316
00:30:27.199 --> 00:30:29.368
Wrong. Wrong!

317
00:30:29.452 --> 00:30:31.996
You've got one thing I don't; information!

318
00:30:32.079 --> 00:30:33.748
You know who did this.

319
00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:37.543
Now, you either tell me
what is really going on,

320
00:30:37.626 --> 00:30:39.712
or I'll cut you with this!
You hear me? I'll cu--

321
00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:49.388
- What?
- It's a two-way mirror.

322
00:31:19.126 --> 00:31:21.212
I can see you.

323
00:31:22.296 --> 00:31:23.714
<i>So, that's what this is...</i>

324
00:31:24.256 --> 00:31:25.674
<i>reality TV.</i>

325
00:31:25.758 --> 00:31:28.594
Don't look at me. I can't help you.

326
00:31:28.677 --> 00:31:30.638
Can you hear me in there, huh?

327
00:31:30.721 --> 00:31:32.431
I'm having a blast.

328
00:31:32.515 --> 00:31:34.350
This is the most fun
I've had without lubricant.

329
00:31:35.935 --> 00:31:37.686
Make sure you're getting everything.

330
00:31:41.649 --> 00:31:43.109
That's not gonna do anything.

331
00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:46.404
You just want to leave it running on us'?

332
00:31:46.487 --> 00:31:47.863
<i>Well, you won't stop it.</i>

333
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:50.533
Well, that's why we
can't cut through these chains.

334
00:31:50.616 --> 00:31:52.243
It's why you won't break that glass.

335
00:31:52.326 --> 00:31:55.579
Every possible angle
has been pre-thought out by him.

336
00:31:55.663 --> 00:31:57.957
You make it sound like
you admire this prick.

337
00:31:58.666 --> 00:32:00.042
To overcome something,

338
00:32:00.126 --> 00:32:02.378
you have to understand
what a perfect engine it is.

339
00:32:02.461 --> 00:32:04.171
That's how you fight disease.

340
00:32:06.006 --> 00:32:08.134
Now the tape told us to find an

341
00:32:08.217 --> 00:32:10.803
That "X" has to be
somewhere in this room.

342
00:32:10.886 --> 00:32:12.096
Help me find it.

343
00:32:12.513 --> 00:32:15.724
How can you be the calm doctor guy
when your wife and kid are out there?

344
00:32:15.808 --> 00:32:17.393
He's got them, too.

345
00:32:17.476 --> 00:32:19.061
He could be doing anything
to them right now.

346
00:32:19.145 --> 00:32:22.815
- Are you thinking about that?
- I am thinking about that.

347
00:32:29.238 --> 00:32:32.158
I've been thinking about
the last thing I said to my daughter.

348
00:34:16.595 --> 00:34:18.556
Diana, honey, are you OK?

349
00:34:20.266 --> 00:34:22.101
Diana, honey, can you hear me?

350
00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:23.769
Mommy.

351
00:34:24.436 --> 00:34:25.729
What is it, sweet pea?

352
00:34:26.438 --> 00:34:28.023
There's a man in my room.

353
00:34:29.024 --> 00:34:32.611
Oh, honey, are you sure
he's not just hiding in your imagination?

354
00:34:32.695 --> 00:34:34.405
He talked to me.

355
00:34:36.115 --> 00:34:38.534
OK. I'll come and check your room.

356
00:34:39.118 --> 00:34:42.621
I want Daddy. He'll get the scary man.

357
00:34:43.914 --> 00:34:46.834
All right, if you want. Come on.

358
00:34:49.795 --> 00:34:54.258
Larry, sorry to bother you,
but your daughter had a bad dream again.

359
00:34:54.341 --> 00:34:55.467
Just a minute.

360
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.512
She wants you to check her room.

361
00:34:58.762 --> 00:35:02.349
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Just got to finish this paragraph.

362
00:35:05.811 --> 00:35:08.480
Come on, sweetie. I'll check with you.

363
00:35:10.983 --> 00:35:12.651
Nope. I'm done.

364
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.531
See? There's no one in your room.

365
00:35:18.907 --> 00:35:21.744
There's no such thing as the bad man.

366
00:35:21.827 --> 00:35:23.621
Now can you go to sleep?

367
00:35:23.704 --> 00:35:26.165
- I'm still scared.
- You are?

368
00:35:26.248 --> 00:35:27.583
Give me your tootsie.

369
00:35:30.586 --> 00:35:32.129
Oh, what a big tootsie.

370
00:35:33.005 --> 00:35:34.423
Remember this one?

371
00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:37.092
This little piggy went to market.

372
00:35:37.176 --> 00:35:39.428
This little piggy stayed home.

373
00:35:39.511 --> 00:35:41.764
This little piggy had roast beef.

374
00:35:41.847 --> 00:35:43.849
This little piggy had none.

375
00:35:43.932 --> 00:35:46.143
And this little piggy went...

376
00:35:46.226 --> 00:35:48.854
Whee... all the way home!

377
00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:54.109
I hate that thing.

378
00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:56.945
Well, I have to go to work, sweetheart.

379
00:35:57.029 --> 00:35:59.490
You know what daddy's job is like.
Now, come on.

380
00:36:01.283 --> 00:36:02.993
Let's see.

381
00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:06.205
Try and get some sleep now, OK?

382
00:36:06.288 --> 00:36:07.289
OK.

383
00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.256
You're not gonna leave us,
are you, Daddy?

384
00:36:17.633 --> 00:36:18.801
What?

385
00:36:21.095 --> 00:36:22.763
What are you talking about?

386
00:36:23.806 --> 00:36:26.350
You mean leave you and Mommy?

387
00:36:27.726 --> 00:36:30.145
No. No, sweetheart. I...

388
00:36:31.021 --> 00:36:32.481
I would never do that.

389
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.109
Who gave you that idea?

390
00:36:35.984 --> 00:36:37.486
No one.

391
00:36:38.028 --> 00:36:40.698
Well, it's not true, OK?

392
00:36:41.615 --> 00:36:42.783
OK.

393
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.660
How much do I love you?

394
00:36:44.785 --> 00:36:46.412
- Love you very much.
- ...very much.

395
00:36:46.495 --> 00:36:48.622
That's right. That's right.

396
00:36:49.248 --> 00:36:51.375
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Daddy.

397
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:57.631
Tomorrow...

398
00:36:58.173 --> 00:36:59.842
I'll read you your favorite story.

399
00:36:59.925 --> 00:37:02.219
- OK.
- OK.

400
00:37:02.302 --> 00:37:04.304
<i>I don't know how much longer
I can do this, Larry.</i>

401
00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:05.681
Do what? What are you talking about?

402
00:37:05.764 --> 00:37:07.766
How can you walk through life
pretending that you're happy?

403
00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.477
- I am happy.
- That is complete bullshit.

404
00:37:10.936 --> 00:37:13.313
I would rather you just break down
and tell me that you hate me.

405
00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:15.357
At least there would be
some passion in it.

406
00:37:20.654 --> 00:37:22.322
Would you like to see her?

407
00:37:39.173 --> 00:37:40.632
She's beautiful.

408
00:37:41.175 --> 00:37:42.760
Thank you.

409
00:37:43.552 --> 00:37:45.345
You gonna have any more kids?

410
00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:47.598
We've talked about it,

411
00:37:47.681 --> 00:37:51.810
but... with our schedules it's...

412
00:37:52.644 --> 00:37:55.189
it's difficult enough
to concentrate on one.

413
00:37:56.482 --> 00:37:59.151
So, where's the lucky wife?

414
00:38:00.319 --> 00:38:02.488
There's another picture
behind the one you're looking at.

415
00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:04.406
It's my favorite one because...

416
00:38:05.657 --> 00:38:07.075
we're all in it together.

417
00:38:07.159 --> 00:38:10.329
Someone, usually me,
has to hold the camera,

418
00:38:10.412 --> 00:38:12.873
which means I'm always
missing from the photos.

419
00:38:22.049 --> 00:38:24.134
<i>"X" marks the spot.</i>

420
00:38:24.218 --> 00:38:28.013
<i>Sometimes you see more
with your eyes shut.</i>

421
00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.726
It's... it's not here.

422
00:38:33.936 --> 00:38:34.895
What?

423
00:38:34.978 --> 00:38:37.731
This photo you're talking about
is not here.

424
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.567
Really? Are you sure?

425
00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:42.486
Yeah. Just... Oh!

426
00:38:55.207 --> 00:38:58.627
Why, he... he must have taken it. I...

427
00:38:59.169 --> 00:39:01.547
How can you walk through life
pretending that you're happy?

428
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:05.050
- I am happy.
- That is complete bullshit.

429
00:39:05.133 --> 00:39:07.010
I'd rather you break down
and tell me that you hated me.

430
00:39:07.094 --> 00:39:09.054
At least there would be
some passion in it.

431
00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.352
We'll talk about this later, OK?

432
00:39:18.564 --> 00:39:19.940
Just leave.

433
00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:56.184
Good night, little girl.

434
00:40:02.649 --> 00:40:04.151
Diana?

435
00:40:04.693 --> 00:40:05.861
Diana?

436
00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:11.658
Diana!

437
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:53.825
Get away from her!

438
00:40:57.621 --> 00:40:59.539
Mommy!

439
00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.042
Mommy!

440
00:41:02.417 --> 00:41:05.087
Mommy!

441
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.339
Mommy!

442
00:41:21.311 --> 00:41:23.021
Let go of her!

443
00:41:49.756 --> 00:41:54.261
Oh, you little man, I see you.

444
00:41:57.889 --> 00:42:01.768
Does Dr. Gordon know
you're at home with his wife?

445
00:42:03.812 --> 00:42:06.231
I know you know something.

446
00:42:11.737 --> 00:42:13.572
What are you doing in there?

447
00:42:14.406 --> 00:42:16.324
Waiting for the doctor?

448
00:42:16.408 --> 00:42:19.286
I'm waiting for the doctor, too.

449
00:42:30.839 --> 00:42:33.633
I never should have let you go.

450
00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:45.062
<i>There was someone
standing outside here watching.</i>

451
00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:46.813
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

452
00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:50.442
<i>Jigsaw piece.</i>

453
00:42:50.525 --> 00:42:52.569
<i>I think we're gonna
be here for a while, Sing.</i>

454
00:42:57.991 --> 00:43:00.869
<i>Dr. Gordon, are you able to tell us
where you were last night?</i>

455
00:43:00.952 --> 00:43:04.581
And you have no idea how your
penlight showed up at the murder scene?

456
00:43:04.664 --> 00:43:07.751
- We checked your alibi. It holds up.
- Isn't that right, Doctor?

457
00:43:07.834 --> 00:43:10.295
<i>I never should have let you go.</i>

458
00:43:15.383 --> 00:43:16.426
Here we are.

459
00:43:17.886 --> 00:43:22.641
That was, uh, quite an amazing story
that poor woman told.

460
00:43:38.532 --> 00:43:39.491
Look, I'm...

461
00:43:41.076 --> 00:43:43.995
I'm sorry I can't be of more help
to your investigation.

462
00:43:46.039 --> 00:43:48.917
You know, we arrested a dentist last week.

463
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.169
He liked to play with kids a bit too much.

464
00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.005
He lived two blocks from here.

465
00:43:55.173 --> 00:44:00.053
The sewer lines run under
this neighborhood, too... Doctor.

466
00:44:24.578 --> 00:44:30.417
<i>Hello, Amanda.
You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

467
00:44:30.792 --> 00:44:32.627
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

468
00:44:32.711 --> 00:44:35.213
<i>Here's what happens if you lose:</i>

469
00:44:38.383 --> 00:44:40.927
<i>There's a timer at the back
of the device you're wearing.</i>

470
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:43.054
<i>- Hey.
- When the timer goes off...</i>

471
00:44:47.392 --> 00:44:48.894
Hey, I'll catch you guys down there.

472
00:44:48.977 --> 00:44:50.979
<i>Think of it like a reverse bear trap.</i>

473
00:44:56.735 --> 00:44:58.153
<i>I'll show you.</i>

474
00:45:02.741 --> 00:45:04.993
- Hey, Tapp.
- Hmm?

475
00:45:05.076 --> 00:45:07.704
We're gonna go down
to the grill to get a beer.

476
00:45:07.787 --> 00:45:10.165
- You want to come?
- I don't think so. Thanks anyway.

477
00:45:10.248 --> 00:45:12.459
Well, you know, I always ask.

478
00:45:12.542 --> 00:45:15.670
- <i>There's only one key to open...</i>
- I'll <i>leave you to have fun</i> up <i>here.</i>

479
00:45:15.754 --> 00:45:17.088
- Mm-hm.
- <i>It's in the stomach</i>

480
00:45:17.172 --> 00:45:18.798
<i>of your dead cellmate.</i>

481
00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:22.761
Hey, Tapp,
I don't mean for this to be disrespectful.

482
00:45:24.512 --> 00:45:26.973
Maybe you should
find yourself a girlfriend.

483
00:45:30.101 --> 00:45:33.396
<i>It's in the stomach
of your dead cellmate.</i>

484
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.023
<i>Look around--</i>

485
00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:40.737
<i>Look around, Amanda.
Know that I'm not lying.</i>

486
00:45:41.196 --> 00:45:42.989
<i>You better hurry up.</i>

487
00:45:45.867 --> 00:45:47.535
Wait, wait, wait. Hey, Sing.

488
00:45:50.121 --> 00:45:51.915
- Get back here.
- What?

489
00:46:00.966 --> 00:46:02.008
What?

490
00:46:03.551 --> 00:46:04.594
Hey...

491
00:46:05.845 --> 00:46:07.305
Remember 118th street?

492
00:46:11.351 --> 00:46:12.477
K2K.

493
00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:15.647
That gang's territory
was only about four blocks.

494
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:17.107
Now listen to this.

495
00:46:30.704 --> 00:46:33.164
We got to check the records
for all the fire emergencies

496
00:46:33.248 --> 00:46:35.125
that occurred in that area
within the last two weeks.

497
00:46:35.208 --> 00:46:37.294
Go, right now. Mmm!

498
00:46:37.377 --> 00:46:39.337
On the night of Tuesday the 17th,

499
00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:43.508
we got a fire alarm going off
in the rear wing of 213 Stygian Street.

500
00:46:43.591 --> 00:46:46.928
It's an old listing.
Used to be a mannequin factory.

501
00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:49.973
You think we have enough
for a warrant, though?

502
00:46:50.056 --> 00:46:51.850
Who said anything about a warrant?

503
00:46:52.517 --> 00:46:54.561
- Right now?
- Why not?

504
00:46:54.894 --> 00:46:56.021
Yeah, why not?

505
00:47:06.865 --> 00:47:09.492
At least we'll have the cover of darkness.

506
00:47:10.035 --> 00:47:11.911
Yeah. Well, so will anybody else.

507
00:47:58.625 --> 00:48:00.043
<i>I</i> 90'! you.

508
00:48:52.345 --> 00:48:54.556
What the hell is this?

509
00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:12.699
Oh, shit.

510
00:49:23.543 --> 00:49:24.961
Oh, fuck!

511
00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:41.936
- Wait, Sing.
- What?

512
00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.063
- Let's see what he's gonna do.
- Why? we fuckin' got him.

513
00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:45.315
- I just wanna make sure--
- What?

514
00:49:45.398 --> 00:49:47.025
We don't know what he looks like.
Let's see what he's gonna do.

515
00:49:47.108 --> 00:49:48.985
- No fucking way.
- Sing!

516
00:49:49.068 --> 00:49:50.403
- Fuck that. I'm gonna take him.
- Sing, Sing!

517
00:49:51.279 --> 00:49:53.656
What the fuck'? Shit!

518
00:50:39.953 --> 00:50:42.038
Awake already, Jeff?

519
00:50:42.747 --> 00:50:45.542
I need more powerful
tranquilizers next time.

520
00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:49.629
Don't cry.
I've given your life a purpose.

521
00:50:49.712 --> 00:50:52.799
You're a test subject
for something greater than yourself.

522
00:50:52.882 --> 00:50:55.218
- Freeze! Police!
- Hold it right there! Don't move!

523
00:50:55.301 --> 00:50:57.470
Put your fucking hands in the air!

524
00:51:04.811 --> 00:51:06.020
Now you'll make a choice.

525
00:51:06.104 --> 00:51:09.065
In 20 seconds,
the life of this man will be ended.

526
00:51:09.148 --> 00:51:12.110
- Shut it off and get down here!
- What'd you do? Turn it off!

527
00:51:13.194 --> 00:51:15.071
Sing, stop that thing.
I'm taking this bastard down.

528
00:51:15.154 --> 00:51:16.364
Fine.

529
00:51:17.115 --> 00:51:19.033
- Move!
- How do you turn it off?

530
00:51:19.117 --> 00:51:21.786
- Tell him how to stop it, asshole!
- One key will unlock it.

531
00:51:21.869 --> 00:51:24.163
- Where is it'?
- It's in the box.

532
00:51:24.247 --> 00:51:25.707
BOX?

533
00:51:27.458 --> 00:51:28.501
Fuck!

534
00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:34.090
- Which key? Which key?
- Tell him which key it is!

535
00:51:34.173 --> 00:51:35.091
Time's running out.

536
00:51:35.174 --> 00:51:37.343
Shut up and get down here
right now, asshole!

537
00:51:38.845 --> 00:51:40.638
What's more important to you, Officer,

538
00:51:40.722 --> 00:51:43.391
arresting me or the life
of another human being?

539
00:51:44.017 --> 00:51:46.936
Get down on your knees, asshole!

540
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.688
Hands behind your head!

541
00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:50.773
- Tapp!
- Sick bastard!

542
00:51:50.857 --> 00:51:52.483
Yes, I'm sick, Officer.

543
00:51:52.567 --> 00:51:54.736
Tapp, there's like--
There's 100 keys here!

544
00:51:54.819 --> 00:51:58.156
Sick from the disease
eating away at me inside,

545
00:51:58.239 --> 00:52:01.159
sick of people who don't
appreciate their blessings,

546
00:52:01.242 --> 00:52:04.495
sick of those who scoff
at the suffering of others.

547
00:52:07.165 --> 00:52:08.708
I'm sick of it all!

548
00:52:10.543 --> 00:52:11.961
Tapp!

549
00:52:20.595 --> 00:52:24.057
No! No! Tapp! Tapp! Shit!

550
00:52:24.223 --> 00:52:25.892
You're OK. Let me see.

551
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.772
- I'm gonna be back. I'm gonna be back.
- OK.

552
00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:07.141
Freeze, or I'll shoot!

553
00:54:37.315 --> 00:54:38.483
I had you.

554
00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:41.068
I had you on your knees.

555
00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:44.906
But you're running. You're running.

556
00:54:46.657 --> 00:54:49.368
You're running scared because we had you.

557
00:54:50.828 --> 00:54:52.914
We're gonna close this case.

558
00:54:53.831 --> 00:54:57.251
We-- We're gonna close it.
Right, Sing? Right?

559
00:54:57.835 --> 00:54:59.587
We're gonna close it, Sing.

560
00:55:07.386 --> 00:55:11.432
<i>"X" marks the spot.
"X" marks the spot.</i>

561
00:55:12.099 --> 00:55:14.060
<i>We need to search this room again.</i>

562
00:55:15.102 --> 00:55:16.312
<i>What are you doing over there?</i>

563
00:55:18.564 --> 00:55:20.024
Excuse me.

564
00:55:21.234 --> 00:55:22.860
Just because I'm stuck
in this room with you

565
00:55:22.944 --> 00:55:25.530
doesn't mean I have to report to you
every ten seconds.

566
00:55:26.322 --> 00:55:29.617
I really don't see the point
in us not helping one another.

567
00:55:30.701 --> 00:55:33.412
What do you want me to do?
I'm on a leash.

568
00:55:33.913 --> 00:55:36.541
That's exactly why we need to talk.
We need to think.

569
00:55:36.624 --> 00:55:38.000
I am thinking!

570
00:55:38.084 --> 00:55:40.878
Then don't keep me in the dark
about what you're thinking!

571
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:45.508
Turn off the lights.

572
00:55:46.092 --> 00:55:47.134
What?

573
00:55:48.678 --> 00:55:50.555
Turn them off now, please.

574
00:55:50.638 --> 00:55:51.514
Why?

575
00:55:51.597 --> 00:55:53.391
Just turn them off for a second.

576
00:56:08.155 --> 00:56:09.991
Jesus. Behind you.

577
00:56:14.954 --> 00:56:16.455
How come we didn't see that before?

578
00:56:17.415 --> 00:56:18.958
The lights in here hadn't charged it.

579
00:56:19.041 --> 00:56:20.960
It must be glow-in-the-dark
paint or something.

580
00:57:01.459 --> 00:57:04.003
- Open it.
- It's locked.

581
00:57:05.004 --> 00:57:08.132
The key, the one from my envelope,
where is it?

582
00:57:12.136 --> 00:57:14.639
Where the fuck? Here.

583
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.126
A cell phone.

584
00:57:44.335 --> 00:57:46.921
The most beautiful invention
on this planet.

585
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:54.637
Make that second most beautiful invention.

586
00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.973
<i>- Give me that.
- Are you joking?</i>

587
00:57:57.056 --> 00:57:59.976
<i>You're gonna put something
that you found in this room in your mouth?</i>

588
00:58:01.852 --> 00:58:03.646
Yes. I'm willing to risk it.

589
00:58:03.729 --> 00:58:05.398
Give me that sweet cancer.

590
00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:07.566
SHHH, DOCTOR

591
00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:09.068
I don't care. I really don't.

592
00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:10.778
Give me one of those.

593
00:58:12.071 --> 00:58:14.573
<i>The cigarettes are harmless, I promise.</i>

594
00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:18.577
<i>Smoking is only poisonous
when it ends in bloodshed.</i>

595
00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:22.331
<i>Think about this;
you don't need a gun to kill Adam.</i>

596
00:58:22.456 --> 00:58:25.042
May I please have a cigarette?

597
00:58:26.419 --> 00:58:27.878
I'm trying the police.

598
00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:39.849
Shit.

599
00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:44.437
This was meant to receive calls,
not make them.

600
00:58:46.439 --> 00:58:47.857
Wait a minute.

601
00:58:48.774 --> 00:58:50.651
This has happened before.

602
00:58:54.572 --> 00:58:58.242
<i>Last night, after I finished
at the hospital...</i>

603
00:59:00.411 --> 00:59:02.496
<i>I was walking back to my car.</i>

604
00:59:04.206 --> 00:59:06.083
<i>I thought I was alone, but...</i>

605
00:59:07.334 --> 00:59:09.587
<i>I'm sure someone else was there.</i>

606
00:59:52.421 --> 00:59:53.881
Great.

607
01:00:37.258 --> 01:00:42.054
That... thing was waiting for me.

608
01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:54.400
How did you know to turn off the lights?

609
01:00:54.733 --> 01:00:56.443
Who cares? It worked.

610
01:00:56.527 --> 01:00:57.903
Yeah, but how did you know?

611
01:00:57.987 --> 01:01:01.031
- Instinct.
- Instinct?

612
01:01:01.115 --> 01:01:02.283
Yeah.

613
01:01:02.366 --> 01:01:05.703
You know what?
You're a terrible liar.

614
01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:08.455
You say that like you know me.

615
01:01:10.124 --> 01:01:11.500
What else aren't you telling me?

616
01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:14.670
Well, let's see.

617
01:01:15.504 --> 01:01:18.465
On my sixth birthday,
my best friend at the time,

618
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:21.302
Scott Tibbs, stabbed me with a rusty nail.
I didn't tell you about that.

619
01:01:21.385 --> 01:01:22.720
I didn't tell you
that my last girlfriend,

620
01:01:22.803 --> 01:01:23.971
who was a feminist vegan punk,

621
01:01:24.054 --> 01:01:26.515
broke up with me
because she thought I was too angry.

622
01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:28.601
I haven't told you
that one of my toenails is slightly--

623
01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:30.227
Just stop it!

624
01:01:31.353 --> 01:01:33.480
You knew to turn off these lights.

625
01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:34.857
Whatever.

626
01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.651
I'm dealing with a juvenile.

627
01:01:37.735 --> 01:01:40.154
- You want to know?
- Yeah!

628
01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.617
Here it is.

629
01:01:54.752 --> 01:01:55.920
Come.

630
01:01:59.757 --> 01:02:00.841
Oh, God.

631
01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.807
Where did you get this?

632
01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:10.559
It was in your wallet...

633
01:02:11.352 --> 01:02:12.937
behind the photo of your daughter.

634
01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.648
Why didn't you show me this before?

635
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:17.566
I couldn't.

636
01:02:21.862 --> 01:02:23.239
I'm sorry.

637
01:02:34.416 --> 01:02:36.919
What are you doing to them, you bastard?!

638
01:02:44.718 --> 01:02:47.346
OK. OK.

639
01:02:48.389 --> 01:02:50.599
OK, I've got to think now.

640
01:02:54.311 --> 01:02:55.562
<i>Think about this.</i>

641
01:02:55.646 --> 01:02:58.023
<i>You don't need a gun to kill Adam.</i>

642
01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:01.527
<i>When there's that much
poison in your blood,</i>

643
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:05.489
<i>the only thing left to do
is shoot yourself.</i>

644
01:03:38.897 --> 01:03:39.940
What are you doing?

645
01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:51.076
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

646
01:03:52.119 --> 01:03:55.831
Shh. Adam, listen to me.

647
01:03:55.914 --> 01:03:57.666
I want you to play along with me on this.

648
01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:06.842
You got that?

649
01:04:20.147 --> 01:04:23.025
So, you...
you still want that cigarette?

650
01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:26.195
Yeah.

651
01:04:26.278 --> 01:04:27.363
Sure.

652
01:05:37.558 --> 01:05:39.601
There! I've done it!

653
01:05:40.144 --> 01:05:42.438
I've killed him with the poison
just like you wanted!

654
01:05:42.521 --> 01:05:44.565
Now where's my family?

655
01:05:44.648 --> 01:05:46.191
Where are they?

656
01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.201
Jesus Christ!

657
01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.703
What are you--

658
01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:01.832
- I just got electrocuted!
- What?

659
01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:05.544
Jesus, that was our way out.

660
01:06:05.627 --> 01:06:07.546
Did you hear what I said?

661
01:06:07.629 --> 01:06:10.048
Get this thing off me! Get it off!

662
01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:11.758
Stop acting!

663
01:06:11.842 --> 01:06:13.343
You think I would make that up

664
01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:15.387
just to mess up
your stupid fuckin' charade?!

665
01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:16.889
All right, that's it.

666
01:06:32.946 --> 01:06:33.780
Damn it!

667
01:06:40.621 --> 01:06:42.080
I remember everything now.

668
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:46.627
I remember how I got here.

669
01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:37.112
Great.

670
01:09:06.933 --> 01:09:08.185
Is someone there?

671
01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:21.698
I can hear you.

672
01:09:57.484 --> 01:09:58.694
What the...?

673
01:10:02.155 --> 01:10:04.116
What the fuck is that?

674
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:15.502
What the...?

675
01:10:22.884 --> 01:10:24.010
Who is that?

676
01:10:25.095 --> 01:10:26.138
Who's in there?

677
01:10:28.098 --> 01:10:29.725
Come out!

678
01:10:29.808 --> 01:10:31.643
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

679
01:11:15.228 --> 01:11:16.313
Who is this?

680
01:11:17.230 --> 01:11:18.356
<i>Daddy.</i>

681
01:11:19.524 --> 01:11:20.776
Diana.

682
01:11:20.859 --> 01:11:22.944
Daddy, is that you?

683
01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:26.740
Yeah, baby, it's me. I'm here.

684
01:11:26.823 --> 01:11:29.242
I'm scared, Daddy.

685
01:11:29.326 --> 01:11:32.454
Don't worry, honey.
Everything's gonna be OK.

686
01:11:32.537 --> 01:11:33.789
<i>Where's Mommy?</i>

687
01:11:34.372 --> 01:11:36.041
She's here with me.

688
01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:40.712
Let me talk to her, sweetie.
OK? Put Mommy on.

689
01:11:41.213 --> 01:11:43.924
The bad man from my room is here.

690
01:11:44.174 --> 01:11:45.967
<i>He has us tied up...</i>

691
01:11:47.969 --> 01:11:50.096
and he has a gun.

692
01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.390
What man?

693
01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:54.351
<i>Please come home, Daddy.</i>

694
01:11:55.769 --> 01:11:59.189
Hello? Hello?

695
01:11:59.981 --> 01:12:00.941
Diana <i>?</i>

696
01:12:02.067 --> 01:12:03.193
Diana <i>?</i>

697
01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:05.946
Diana!

698
01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:10.408
Larry.

699
01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:11.993
Ali?

700
01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:13.537
<i>Is that you?</i>

701
01:12:14.287 --> 01:12:15.831
Is Adam there?

702
01:12:18.416 --> 01:12:19.960
Well, how do you know...

703
01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:22.212
Ali...

704
01:12:23.296 --> 01:12:25.006
What is going on?

705
01:12:26.049 --> 01:12:28.051
Don't believe Adam's lies.

706
01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.637
<i>He knows you.</i>

707
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.014
<i>He knew all about you before today.</i>

708
01:12:37.602 --> 01:12:40.188
Hello? Ali?

709
01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:41.773
Ali?

710
01:12:43.733 --> 01:12:44.776
Hello!

711
01:12:46.152 --> 01:12:47.195
God damn you!

712
01:12:47.946 --> 01:12:50.907
If you so much as lay a finger on them,
I'll kill you!

713
01:12:50.991 --> 01:12:54.327
You hear me, you son of a bitch?!
I'll kill you!

714
01:13:00.083 --> 01:13:01.167
Fuck!

715
01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:05.297
Are they OK?

716
01:13:08.675 --> 01:13:10.844
My wife, she...

717
01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:12.762
She mentioned your name.

718
01:13:14.848 --> 01:13:16.349
What did she say?

719
01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:19.352
She told me...

720
01:13:21.104 --> 01:13:22.397
not to believe you.

721
01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:25.108
Believe me about what?

722
01:13:28.236 --> 01:13:30.363
She told me you knew me.

723
01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.453
Who are you?

724
01:13:37.704 --> 01:13:39.539
You know who I am.

725
01:13:39.623 --> 01:13:42.208
Stop the lies! You're a liar!

726
01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:44.252
I need to know the truth!

727
01:13:46.296 --> 01:13:47.714
I'm a liar'?

728
01:13:49.549 --> 01:13:51.468
What did you do last night, Lawrence?

729
01:13:52.385 --> 01:13:55.013
Work at a hospital, saving sick children?

730
01:13:55.096 --> 01:13:57.849
You told me that after you
left your house last night,

731
01:13:57.933 --> 01:13:59.893
you went to work at a hospital.

732
01:13:59.976 --> 01:14:01.478
That's because it's the truth.

733
01:14:01.561 --> 01:14:02.938
No, it's not.

734
01:14:03.396 --> 01:14:05.607
Your wife is right, Larry.

735
01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:09.569
You don't recall getting
your picture taken in that parking lot?

736
01:14:28.171 --> 01:14:31.341
I can prove that you didn't go
anywhere near a hospital last night.

737
01:14:39.224 --> 01:14:41.601
It's not the first time
I've done it, either, Larry.

738
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:44.229
I've been taking pictures of you
for a few days now.

739
01:14:50.735 --> 01:14:52.988
- Why?
- You want to know what I do?

740
01:14:53.071 --> 01:14:55.573
I get paid to take pictures
of rich guys like you

741
01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:58.827
who go to seedy, out-of-the-way motels
to fuck their secretaries.

742
01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:01.913
Last night, I went to your house
and watched you leave.

743
01:15:03.206 --> 01:15:04.374
<i>I followed you...</i>

744
01:15:06.042 --> 01:15:08.128
<i>all the way to that shit-bag hotel.</i>

745
01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:14.843
You've... had these with you
the whole time?

746
01:15:14.926 --> 01:15:18.388
No, I found them in there
with the hacksaws.

747
01:15:18.888 --> 01:15:20.306
I don't know how they got there.

748
01:15:20.932 --> 01:15:24.144
Yeah, right. You're so full of it!

749
01:15:24.227 --> 01:15:27.188
Face it, Larry.
We're both bullshitters.

750
01:15:27.272 --> 01:15:29.274
But my camera isn't.
It doesn't know how to lie.

751
01:15:29.899 --> 01:15:32.193
It only shows you
what's put right in front of it.

752
01:15:32.736 --> 01:15:35.572
Just out of curiosity,
what did you do in that motel room?

753
01:15:35.989 --> 01:15:37.907
You got out of there pretty fast.

754
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.460
Why did you...

755
01:15:49.085 --> 01:15:52.464
deem it necessary to page me
when you knew I was at home?

756
01:15:54.257 --> 01:15:56.217
I didn't know if you were gonna make it.

757
01:15:57.010 --> 01:16:00.513
But I gave you a precise time
at which to page me.

758
01:16:01.431 --> 01:16:03.892
You can't do that.

759
01:16:03.975 --> 01:16:06.728
It's not like I know the rules
for this sort of stuff.

760
01:16:10.273 --> 01:16:11.983
What's wrong, Dr. Gordon?

761
01:16:12.859 --> 01:16:13.985
Look...

762
01:16:15.487 --> 01:16:17.655
it was wrong of me to make you come here.

763
01:16:18.239 --> 01:16:22.619
- But I thought we--
- No, no. Please.

764
01:16:23.953 --> 01:16:25.413
I'm sorry.

765
01:16:38.426 --> 01:16:39.761
You tell anyone you were here?

766
01:16:40.428 --> 01:16:41.554
No.

767
01:16:52.565 --> 01:16:53.733
Hello.

768
01:16:58.863 --> 01:17:00.156
It's for you.

769
01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:02.075
For me?

770
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:16.714
Hello.

771
01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.428
<i>I know what you're doing, Doctor.</i>

772
01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:25.140
I\\

773
01:17:36.776 --> 01:17:39.863
- I have to go.
- What happened?

774
01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:40.864
<i>I</i> got to go-

775
01:17:59.716 --> 01:18:00.717
Who was it?

776
01:18:01.384 --> 01:18:02.427
Who was what?

777
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:05.638
The person who paid you
to follow me, who was it?

778
01:18:05.722 --> 01:18:07.849
He calls himself Bob,
and he gives me the money up front.

779
01:18:07.932 --> 01:18:09.767
Two-hundred bucks a night.

780
01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:11.060
If I'd known I was gonna end up here,

781
01:18:11.144 --> 01:18:12.562
I would have asked for
a hell of a lot more.

782
01:18:12.645 --> 01:18:14.272
What does that mean?

783
01:18:14.355 --> 01:18:15.815
Does that mean you saw
what happened to me?

784
01:18:15.899 --> 01:18:19.527
What I saw was you get into your car.
That's it.

785
01:18:19.611 --> 01:18:22.322
I didn't ask your name.
I didn't know who you were.

786
01:18:22.405 --> 01:18:25.658
I don't know how I got here.
I don't know how you got here.

787
01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:29.454
<i>I just took the shots
and went straight home to develop them.</i>

788
01:18:29.537 --> 01:18:34.542
Next thing I know, I'm chained to a pipe
in some prehistoric bathroom,

789
01:18:34.626 --> 01:18:36.794
staring at the guy
I've been taking shots of all night.

790
01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:39.214
Clearly, whoever paid you
to take pictures of me

791
01:18:39.297 --> 01:18:41.424
- is the one who put us here.
- Maybe.

792
01:18:41.507 --> 01:18:43.551
What do you mean "maybe"? Of course it is.
What did he look like?

793
01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:46.346
- I don't know, he's just a guy.
- Was he tall? Was he skinny, obese, what?

794
01:18:46.429 --> 01:18:47.931
I don't take notes about his appearance.

795
01:18:48.014 --> 01:18:49.724
- You must remember something about him.
- I can't!

796
01:18:49.807 --> 01:18:51.601
You're telling me you don't remember
a thing about the guy?

797
01:18:51.684 --> 01:18:55.146
- I told you--
- Oh, for fuck's sake! I give up!

798
01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:58.775
He's a tall black guy.
He's got a scar around his neck, OK?

799
01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:09.369
Tapp-

800
01:19:12.705 --> 01:19:14.082
Detective Tapp.

801
01:19:14.290 --> 01:19:16.000
Whoa.

802
01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:19.212
The guy who paid me
to take these photos was not a cop.

803
01:19:19.295 --> 01:19:22.215
No, no, no. He was-- He was discharged
from the police force.

804
01:19:22.298 --> 01:19:24.801
He broke down
after his partner was killed.

805
01:19:24.884 --> 01:19:27.053
<i>But that didn't stop him
from harassing me.</i>

806
01:19:27.136 --> 01:19:28.846
<i>The guy became obsessed.</i>

807
01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:31.724
He convinced himself that I must have
somehow been involved with the murders.

808
01:19:31.808 --> 01:19:33.685
<i>I mean-- He's crazy.</i>

809
01:19:33.768 --> 01:19:35.019
And you helped him.

810
01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:38.106
You took money from him
to invade my privacy.

811
01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:42.068
- How could you do that?
- Call it my need to eat.

812
01:19:42.527 --> 01:19:45.488
Right. Right. You know what, Adam?

813
01:19:45.571 --> 01:19:48.032
You're not a victim of this game;
you're part of it.

814
01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:51.619
Oh, really? Obviously, this cop
thinks you're the one behind it all.

815
01:19:51.703 --> 01:19:53.621
I told you, he's not a cop.

816
01:19:53.705 --> 01:19:56.040
He's a bottom feeder, just like you.

817
01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:58.751
What are you more pissed off about:
the fact that I took some shots of you,

818
01:19:58.835 --> 01:20:01.587
or the fact that I took some shots of you
while you were cheating on your wife?

819
01:20:01.671 --> 01:20:03.506
I did not cheat on her!

820
01:20:03.589 --> 01:20:05.466
What do you care what I think anyway?

821
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:07.844
I don't give a crap
if you covered yourself in peanut butter

822
01:20:07.927 --> 01:20:10.096
and had a 15-hooker gang bang.

823
01:20:25.361 --> 01:20:27.113
How did I get here?

824
01:20:27.196 --> 01:20:29.782
I-- I had everything in order.

825
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.787
My whole life was in perfect order.

826
01:21:01.981 --> 01:21:04.359
Sweetheart, are you OK?

827
01:21:07.487 --> 01:21:09.238
Mommy just needs you to be

828
01:21:09.322 --> 01:21:11.866
really, really, really,
really strong right now.

829
01:21:13.409 --> 01:21:16.746
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.

830
01:21:17.455 --> 01:21:18.998
You got that?

831
01:21:19.082 --> 01:21:21.125
OK. That's my good girl.

832
01:21:44.816 --> 01:21:48.694
<i>Hey, was there someone else
at your house last night,</i>

833
01:21:48.778 --> 01:21:50.571
<i>besides your wife and daughter?</i>

834
01:21:50.655 --> 01:21:51.948
<i>No.</i>

835
01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:53.825
<i>Well, there's someone here.</i>

836
01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:12.593
I know him.

837
01:22:13.136 --> 01:22:14.011
Zep.

838
01:22:14.554 --> 01:22:15.721
<i>Who?</i>

839
01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:17.473
His name is Zep.

840
01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:19.767
<i>He's an orderly at my hospital.</i>

841
01:22:20.518 --> 01:22:24.480
Zep. You perverted little psychopath.

842
01:22:24.564 --> 01:22:28.151
I'm gonna take great pleasure
in seeing you pay for this,

843
01:22:28.234 --> 01:22:30.236
you bastard fuck!

844
01:22:33.531 --> 01:22:34.532
Look.

845
01:22:41.414 --> 01:22:42.415
We're out of time.

846
01:23:03.853 --> 01:23:06.814
Shh, shh, shh.
Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie.

847
01:23:07.273 --> 01:23:09.442
- Mommy, help me!
- Shh...

848
01:23:27.043 --> 01:23:29.504
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

849
01:23:30.671 --> 01:23:32.798
Now I've got to do what I've got to do,

850
01:23:32.882 --> 01:23:38.387
and I'm afraid it has to be you
that tells him he failed.

851
01:23:50.233 --> 01:23:51.943
Is that you, Zep, you bastard?!

852
01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.737
I know it's you, you son of a bitch!

853
01:23:54.987 --> 01:23:56.572
Larry.

854
01:23:56.656 --> 01:23:57.657
Ali?

855
01:23:58.866 --> 01:23:59.909
You failed.

856
01:24:02.245 --> 01:24:03.162
Hello?

857
01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:04.956
Hello?

858
01:24:08.417 --> 01:24:09.669
Wait.

859
01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:14.840
Don't move! Stay on the ground.

860
01:24:15.341 --> 01:24:17.134
Give me-- Give me the phone.

861
01:24:18.344 --> 01:24:19.804
Give it to me!

862
01:24:31.774 --> 01:24:33.901
. Larry-

863
01:24:34.485 --> 01:24:35.570
Honey, are you all right'?

864
01:24:35.653 --> 01:24:38.239
No. No-- No, we're not.

865
01:24:38.322 --> 01:24:39.615
Get down!

866
01:24:40.199 --> 01:24:41.742
Larry, where are you?

867
01:24:41.826 --> 01:24:43.452
I don't know.

868
01:24:43.536 --> 01:24:46.080
I'm being held captive
in a room somewhere.

869
01:24:46.163 --> 01:24:48.249
What are you talking about?

870
01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:51.544
<i>- I'm</i> so sorry, <i>Ali.</i>
- Honey, we need you here.

871
01:24:51.627 --> 01:24:54.046
<i>I'm so sorry for everything.
It's my fault.</i>

872
01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:55.172
Please forgive me.

873
01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:56.632
<i>I've always been happy with you.</i>

874
01:24:56.716 --> 01:24:57.967
Mommy.

875
01:25:00.803 --> 01:25:01.637
Jesus!

876
01:25:04.515 --> 01:25:05.933
Ali!

877
01:25:26.412 --> 01:25:28.372
Ali! Ali!

878
01:25:29.707 --> 01:25:31.417
Mommy, help me!

879
01:25:46.265 --> 01:25:47.183
Freeze!

880
01:25:57.777 --> 01:25:59.654
- What?
- Oh, no.

881
01:26:04.408 --> 01:26:05.701
What the fuck'?

882
01:26:32.603 --> 01:26:33.938
Mrs. Gordon?

883
01:26:37.566 --> 01:26:39.193
Diana!

884
01:26:43.781 --> 01:26:46.367
I'm gonna kill your husband now,
Mrs. Gordon.

885
01:27:15.646 --> 01:27:16.480
Lawrence!

886
01:27:22.194 --> 01:27:23.529
Lawrence, get up!

887
01:27:35.124 --> 01:27:36.584
Lawrence!

888
01:27:36.667 --> 01:27:37.960
Get up!

889
01:27:38.794 --> 01:27:39.879
I need you!

890
01:27:53.559 --> 01:27:55.394
Oh, thank God.

891
01:27:55.478 --> 01:27:57.229
I thought you were dead.

892
01:28:02.276 --> 01:28:05.112
He... he electrocuted me.

893
01:28:05.196 --> 01:28:08.324
I told you.
The same thing happened to me.

894
01:28:08.407 --> 01:28:10.868
See? I wasn't lying. See?

895
01:28:11.702 --> 01:28:13.162
Fuck this shit!

896
01:29:21.063 --> 01:29:22.982
No!

897
01:29:24.942 --> 01:29:26.861
Lawrence, calm down.

898
01:29:26.944 --> 01:29:28.362
There must be a way out of this.

899
01:29:28.445 --> 01:29:30.573
Oh, shut up! Just shut up!

900
01:29:30.656 --> 01:29:32.741
My family needs me!

901
01:29:33.909 --> 01:29:35.953
No! God!

902
01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:38.622
God! No!

903
01:29:45.170 --> 01:29:47.464
Lawrence! I have a family, too!

904
01:29:47.798 --> 01:29:51.677
I don't see them! That's my mistake!
It's a mistake I'd like to fix!

905
01:29:56.181 --> 01:29:58.309
I'm gonna kill you, you sick asshole!

906
01:30:01.353 --> 01:30:04.398
Lawrence! Stop it.

907
01:30:08.694 --> 01:30:10.946
Lawrence, just calm down.

908
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:12.281
There's a way out of here.

909
01:30:12.364 --> 01:30:13.657
There's a way out!

910
01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:15.159
Lawrence!

911
01:30:16.702 --> 01:30:19.872
No! What-- No! Oh, my God!

912
01:30:19.955 --> 01:30:21.290
Lawrence!

913
01:30:23.667 --> 01:30:25.127
What are you doing?

914
01:31:37.074 --> 01:31:39.410
What... are you doing?

915
01:32:01.473 --> 01:32:03.017
What are you... what are you...

916
01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.104
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

917
01:32:09.773 --> 01:32:13.736
Lawrence, don't! No!
No, Lawrence, please!

918
01:32:13.819 --> 01:32:15.029
I'm begging you!

919
01:32:16.613 --> 01:32:19.324
Lawrence!
It's not me who did this to you!

920
01:32:20.617 --> 01:32:21.660
You have to die.

921
01:32:21.744 --> 01:32:23.287
No! I want to live!

922
01:32:23.370 --> 01:32:24.621
- I want to live!
- I'm sorry.

923
01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:27.291
- I want to live!
- My family.

924
01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:42.431
There!

925
01:32:43.015 --> 01:32:44.266
I've done it!

926
01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.270
Now show them to me!

927
01:32:50.981 --> 01:32:52.274
Show them to me.

928
01:32:52.775 --> 01:32:54.109
Thank you very much, Officer.

929
01:32:54.193 --> 01:32:56.904
- Larry?
- Did you get through to him?

930
01:32:56.987 --> 01:32:59.281
- No. There's still no answer.
- It's all right. I've called the police.

931
01:32:59.364 --> 01:33:00.532
Everything is OK.

932
01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.051
You bastard!

933
01:33:19.134 --> 01:33:22.304
I'll fucking kill you!
I'll fucking kill you!

934
01:33:22.387 --> 01:33:26.016
You fucking bastard!
I'll fucking kill you!

935
01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:30.020
You fucking bastard!
I'll fucking kill you!

936
01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:33.023
I'll fucking kill you.

937
01:33:40.864 --> 01:33:42.741
You're too late.

938
01:33:43.492 --> 01:33:44.868
Why?

939
01:33:45.202 --> 01:33:46.787
It's the rules.

940
01:34:30.414 --> 01:34:32.249
You're gonna be all right.

941
01:34:32.332 --> 01:34:34.877
You're just wounded in the shoulder.

942
01:34:35.919 --> 01:34:38.755
I have to go and get help.

943
01:34:38.881 --> 01:34:40.757
Don't leave me!

944
01:34:41.341 --> 01:34:45.345
No! No! No!

945
01:34:46.513 --> 01:34:47.764
No!

946
01:34:51.059 --> 01:34:52.769
Lawrence!

947
01:34:53.312 --> 01:34:54.354
Lawrence!

948
01:34:59.109 --> 01:35:00.527
Don't worry.

949
01:35:00.611 --> 01:35:02.112
I'll bring someone back.

950
01:35:02.196 --> 01:35:03.280
I promise.

951
01:35:23.842 --> 01:35:25.177
OK.

952
01:35:44.279 --> 01:35:46.031
Key. Key-

953
01:36:08.387 --> 01:36:10.138
<i>Hello, Mr. Hindle...</i>

954
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:15.978
<i>or as they called you
around the hospital... Zep.</i>

955
01:36:16.561 --> 01:36:18.188
<i>I want you to make a choice.</i>

956
01:36:22.567 --> 01:36:26.196
<i>There's a slow-acting poison
coursing through your system</i>

957
01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:28.991
<i>which only I have the antidote for.</i>

958
01:36:29.074 --> 01:36:33.662
<i>Will you murder a mother and her child
to save yourself?</i>

959
01:36:34.162 --> 01:36:36.123
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

960
01:36:36.206 --> 01:36:37.457
Mrs. Gordon!

961
01:36:38.333 --> 01:36:40.419
<i>Listen carefully if you will.</i>

962
01:36:40.502 --> 01:36:41.628
<i>There are rules.</i>

963
01:36:41.712 --> 01:36:42.713
Why?

964
01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:44.131
It's the rules.

965
01:37:31.511 --> 01:37:35.265
The key to that chain is in the bathtub.

966
01:37:46.068 --> 01:37:49.029
He's a very interesting person.
His name is John.

967
01:37:49.112 --> 01:37:51.531
He has an inoperable frontal-lobe tumor.

968
01:37:51.615 --> 01:37:54.326
<i>I'm sick from the disease
eating away at me inside.</i>

969
01:37:54.409 --> 01:37:55.535
Looks like our friend Jigsaw.

970
01:37:55.619 --> 01:37:57.913
<i>I'm sick of people
who don't appreciate their blessings.</i>

971
01:37:57.996 --> 01:37:59.289
It looks like our guy
likes to book himself

972
01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:01.541
<i>front-row seats for his own sicko games.</i>

973
01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:05.504
<i>Hello, Mark, Paul, Amanda,
Zep, Adam, Dr. Gordon.</i>

974
01:38:05.587 --> 01:38:07.297
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

975
01:38:33.490 --> 01:38:37.285
<i>Most people are so ungrateful
to be alive...</i>

976
01:38:38.787 --> 01:38:42.124
<i>but not you, not anymore.</i>

977
01:38:46.461 --> 01:38:47.838
<i>Game over.</i>

978
01:38:52.509 --> 01:38:55.303
<i>Don't! Don't!</i>

979
01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:56.930
<i>Don't!</i>
