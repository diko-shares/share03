- Morning, Wells.
- Morning, sir.

17
00:04:16.424 --> 00:04:17.758
Hi.

18
00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:22.471
Ghost Rider, this is Strike.

19
00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.223
We have unknown aircraft.

20
00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:25.683
Inbound, Mustang.

21
00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.102
Your vector, 090 for bogey.

22
00:04:38.362 --> 00:04:39.530
Who's up there?

23
00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.991
Cougar and Merlin
and Maverick and Goose.

24
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.451
Great.

25
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:45.494
Maverick and Goose.

26
00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:56.046
Talk to me, Goose.

27
00:04:56.464 --> 00:04:59.049
Roger, I got him.
Contact, 20 left at 30 miles.

28
00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:00.342
Nine-hundred knots closure.

29
00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:03.888
- Cougar, you hear that?
- Roger.

30
00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:07.141
- Merlin, you got him?
- Roger, I've got radar contact.

31
00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:09.643
I'll get a visual ID.
Cougar, you hook him.

32
00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:11.604
Roger, and I'll clean him and fry him.

33
00:05:19.028 --> 00:05:22.740
<i>Mustang.
Mustang, this is Ghost Rider, 203.</i>

34
00:05:22.907 --> 00:05:26.202
<i>I've got him inbound,
bogey heading 270.</i>

35
00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:28.996
<i>We're at ten miles, 900 knots closure.</i>

36
00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:32.249
Ghost Rider, take Angels ten left, 30.

37
00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.894
Are we supposed to have visitors today?

38
00:05:33.918 --> 00:05:35.211
Negative, sir.

39
00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:44.929
- Merlin, see if he's a single.
- Roger.

40
00:05:47.306 --> 00:05:50.226
- Goose, you see a trailer?
- Negative, Merlin.

41
00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:52.728
Looks like he's a single.

42
00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:54.783
Cougar, I'm gonna go
head-to-head with him.

43
00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:57.233
Take it easy, Maverick.
I don't like this shit.

44
00:05:57.358 --> 00:06:00.152
I'm gonna break high and right,
see if he's really alone.

45
00:06:19.171 --> 00:06:20.798
We've got 1,000 knots closure, Mav.

46
00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.258
<i>He's coming right at us.</i>

47
00:06:22.466 --> 00:06:24.468
Okay, buddy, what's on your mind?

48
00:06:27.054 --> 00:06:28.389
Holy shit, there's two of them.

49
00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:31.767
<i>MiG-28s.
No one's been this close before.</i>

50
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.478
What the hell are they doing here?
What's the position?

51
00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:36.289
Two hundred and fifty miles out, sir.

52
00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:38.357
Two hundred and fifty miles?
Get them out of here.

53
00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:43.112
Cougar, you've got MiG one.
I'm going after MiG two.

54
00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:46.574
I lost him in the sun.

55
00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:49.660
Shit. What's he doing?

56
00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:51.620
You got him, Merlin?

57
00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.791
He's coming around.
He's coming around on our tail.

58
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:58.836
God damn it. This bogey's all over me.

59
00:07:02.715 --> 00:07:04.049
What's their range now?

60
00:07:04.133 --> 00:07:05.759
Two hundred miles, sir.

61
00:07:05.968 --> 00:07:07.219
If they break 150 miles,

62
00:07:07.303 --> 00:07:09.471
- launch the Alert Five aircraft.
- Yes, sir.

63
00:07:11.724 --> 00:07:13.267
Air speed, 300. Go get him, Mav.

64
00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.394
I'm going for missile lock.

65
00:07:16.145 --> 00:07:18.480
Let's see if we can scare
this guy out of here.

66
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.691
Come on, lock up, baby.

67
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.194
Lock up, baby. Lock up.

68
00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:26.488
I got him locked. Bingo.

69
00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:34.246
We got him, Mav.
He's bugging out and going home.

70
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.999
Mustang, this is Maverick.
MiG two is headed home.

71
00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:39.946
All right, what's their position?

72
00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:42.671
A hundred and eighty miles
at bearing 010, sir.

73
00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:48.886
Cougar, he's got missile lock on us.
Get away from this guy.

74
00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:50.888
What the hell is this shit?
He's engaging me.

75
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.351
God damn it, Mustang.
This is Ghost Rider,

76
00:07:55.434 --> 00:07:57.353
one, one, seven,
this bogey's all over me.

77
00:07:57.436 --> 00:07:59.539
He's got missile lock on me.
Do I have permission to fire?

78
00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:01.732
Do not fire until fired upon.

79
00:08:04.276 --> 00:08:05.796
Goose, there they are, right below us.

80
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.239
The MiG's in perfect firing position.
He's right on Cougar's tail.

81
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.826
No way, Goose. He'd have fired by now.
He's just trying to piss us off.

82
00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:15.496
Maverick, get down here
and get this asshole off me.

83
00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:19.166
Easy, Cougar.

84
00:08:20.084 --> 00:08:25.464
Bring it back, hard right.
Help me engage. I'm on my way.

85
00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.525
I can't shoot this son of a bitch.

86
00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:46.448
Let's see if we can have
a little fun with him.

87
00:08:51.824 --> 00:08:53.659
Is this your idea of fun, Mav?

88
00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.163
Greetings.

89
00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:02.876
Watch the birdie.

90
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.338
Jeez, I crack myself up.

91
00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:16.807
This is a great shot, Mav.
I should be a photographer.

92
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.892
Cougar,

93
00:09:19.393 --> 00:09:21.061
your tail is clear. MiG one's bugged out.

94
00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.365
Cougar, this is Maverick.

95
00:09:34.158 --> 00:09:36.160
We've had enough fun
for one day, don't you think?

96
00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.304
I'm getting a little low on fuel,

97
00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.496
so we're heading home.

98
00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.209
We'll see you on deck.

99
00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:56.555
Cougar, we're running low on gas,
we gotta get out of here.

100
00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.267
Cougar.

101
00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:04.229
We're on vapor, Cougar.

102
00:10:04.772 --> 00:10:06.148
Let's do it.

103
00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:09.943
Cougar. Come on, Cougar.

104
00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:21.079
<i>Let's take it back to the ship, man.</i>

105
00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:23.123
<i>Come on, Cougar.</i>

106
00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:26.001
Get him on deck as soon as possible.
He's gotta be low on fuel.

107
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:31.256
Cougar, we gotta land this thing.
We are way low on gas.

108
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.758
You understand me?

109
00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:35.302
<i>You all right, man?</i>

110
00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:44.770
<i>Maverick, you're at three-quarters
of a mile, call the ball.</i>

111
00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:47.147
Roger. Maverick has the ball.

112
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.027
- Cougar, it is time to land. Let's do it.
- Goose, Cougar's in trouble.

113
00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.154
Come on, Mav,
we're getting low on gas.

114
00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.697
Let's land this sucker.

115
00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:58.700
<i>Cougar!</i>

116
00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:06.875
God damn it, Maverick.

117
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.086
What're you doing, Mav?
We've got no fuel for this.

118
00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.671
We're going after Cougar.

119
00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:15.008
You tell him to land that plane.
That's an order.

120
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:17.636
<i>Ghost Rider, you are instructed to land.</i>

121
00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.179
<i>Land immediately.</i>

122
00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.687
Any of you boys seen
an aircraft carrier around here?

123
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.773
Mav, we got a little problem up here.

124
00:11:29.857 --> 00:11:33.110
That MiG really screwed him up.
I don't think he can make it back.

125
00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:39.408
You're okay, Cougar.
Just stay on my wing,

126
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.243
I'll take you all the way in.

127
00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:42.870
Just stay with me.

128
00:11:57.718 --> 00:12:00.554
Easy, Cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.

129
00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:05.100
<i>You're a little low.
You're a little low, Coug.</i>

130
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.103
Come on, buddy, pull up.

131
00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:11.315
<i>Pull up, Cougar.</i>

132
00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:15.068
That's it. Almost there.

133
00:12:16.445 --> 00:12:20.490
<i>Cougar, you're well below glide path,
three-quarters of a mile. Call the ball.</i>

134
00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.285
<i>Roger, ball.</i>

135
00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:34.796
<i>We're too low, Cougar.</i>

136
00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:36.340
<i>We're too low, Cougar.</i>

137
00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:39.217
<i>Increase power. Some more power!</i>

138
00:12:39.301 --> 00:12:41.345
<i>Higher! Higher! Higher, damn it!</i>

139
00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:52.940
Come in.

140
00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:56.777
Sir.

141
00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:59.731
Cougar, you should be in sickbay.
What's on your mind?

142
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.740
My wife and kid, sir.

143
00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:05.035
I almost orphaned him today,
and I've never even seen him.

144
00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.457
I don't know what happened
up there, but I was so scared.

145
00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:14.211
- Come on, we've seen this before.
- No, sir.

146
00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:17.214
I'm holding on too tight.

147
00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:19.091
I've lost the edge.

148
00:13:20.092 --> 00:13:21.385
I'm sorry, sir.

149
00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:24.638
I'm sorry.

150
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:32.479
Cougar.

151
00:13:35.232 --> 00:13:36.900
Thanks, Maverick.

152
00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.405
Maverick, Goose, come in here.

153
00:13:41.947 --> 00:13:44.574
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

154
00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:46.910
Shit.

155
00:13:51.248 --> 00:13:54.001
Maverick, you just did
an incredibly brave thing.

156
00:13:57.421 --> 00:14:00.090
What you should have done
was land your plane.

157
00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:02.676
You don't own that plane,
the taxpayers do.

158
00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:05.971
Son, your ego is writing checks
your body can't cash.

159
00:14:06.138 --> 00:14:07.514
You've been busted.

160
00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:10.851
You lost your qualifications
as section leader three times.

161
00:14:11.018 --> 00:14:13.270
Put in hack twice by me.

162
00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:15.605
With a history of high-speed passes

163
00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:18.025
over five air-control towers

164
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.860
and one admiral's daughter.

165
00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:21.486
Penny Benjamin?

166
00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:23.488
And you, asshole.

167
00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:25.449
You're lucky to be here.

168
00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.867
Thank you, sir.

169
00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:28.344
And let's not bullshit, Maverick,

170
00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.829
your family name ain't
the best in the Navy.

171
00:14:31.038 --> 00:14:33.874
You need to be doing it better
and cleaner than the other guy.

172
00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:35.125
Now, what is it with you?

173
00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:38.879
Just wanna serve my country,
be the best fighter pilot in the Navy, sir!

174
00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:40.547
Don't screw around with me, Maverick.

175
00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:42.716
You're a hell of an instinctive pilot.

176
00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:44.134
Maybe too good.

177
00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:46.053
I'd like to bust your butt, but I can't.

178
00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:47.971
I got another problem here.

179
00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:51.725
I gotta send somebody
from this squadron to Miramar.

180
00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:53.682
I gotta do something here.

181
00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.687
I still can't believe it.

182
00:14:56.313 --> 00:14:57.814
I gotta give you your dream shot.

183
00:14:57.898 --> 00:14:59.816
I'm gonna send you up against the best.

184
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.693
You two characters

185
00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:03.820
are going to Top Gun.

186
00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:08.867
For five weeks, you're gonna fly against
the best fighter pilots in the world.

187
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:11.411
You were number two,
Cougar was number one.

188
00:15:11.495 --> 00:15:13.330
Cougar lost it, turned in his wings.

189
00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:15.832
You guys are number one.

190
00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:19.086
But you remember one thing.

191
00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.588
You screw up just this much,

192
00:15:22.214 --> 00:15:25.926
you'll be flying a cargo plane
full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong.

193
00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:27.260
Yes, sir!

194
00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:32.516
That is all.

195
00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.602
You can tell me about the MiG some other time.

196
00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:36.770
Gentlemen.

197
00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:38.855
Good luck, gentlemen.

198
00:15:38.939 --> 00:15:40.607
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

206
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.610
During Korea,
the Navy kill ratio was 12-to-1.

207
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:28.405
We shot down 12 of their jets
for every one of ours.

208
00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:31.241
During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-to-1.

209
00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:33.243
Our pilots become dependent upon missiles.

210
00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.745
They had lost some of their dogfighting skills.

211
00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:38.415
Now Top Gun was created to teach A.C.M.

212
00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:39.916
Air Combat Maneuvering.

213
00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:41.918
Dogfighting.

214
00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:43.587
This gives me a hard-on.

215
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.590
By the end of Vietnam,
that ratio was back up to 12-to-1.

216
00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:47.674
Don't tease me.

217
00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.009
Blinds, please.

218
00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:50.987
Now I'd like to take this opportunity

219
00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:53.346
to introduce you to
our commanding officer at Top Gun.

220
00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:55.849
The very first man
to win the Top Gun trophy.

221
00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:59.019
You will not find a finer fighter pilot
anywhere in the world.

222
00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:02.522
Commander Mike Metcalf.
Callsign, Viper.

223
00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:04.774
Gentlemen.

224
00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:09.946
You are the top one percent
of all naval aviators.

225
00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:13.200
The elite.

226
00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.702
The best of the best.

227
00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.704
We'll make you better.

228
00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.957
You'll fly at least
two combat missions a day,

229
00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.459
attend classes in between

230
00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.377
and evaluations of your performance.

231
00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:26.463
Now, on each combat sequence,

232
00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.548
you're gonna meet a different challenge.

233
00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:31.468
Every encounter is gonna be
much more difficult.

234
00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.529
We're gonna teach you to fly the F-14

235
00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:34.697
right to the edge of the envelope,

236
00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.389
faster than you've ever flown before

237
00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:38.516
and more dangerous.

238
00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:41.978
Now, we don't make policy here, gentlemen.

239
00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:45.899
Elected officials, civilians do that.

240
00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:48.401
We are the instruments of that policy.

241
00:17:49.236 --> 00:17:53.573
And although we're not at war, we must
always act as though we are at war.

242
00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:54.741
What are you doing?

243
00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:56.719
- The tip of the spear...
- I'm just wondering...

244
00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:57.744
...best be sharp.

245
00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:59.079
...who's the best.

246
00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:01.915
In case some of you wonder
who the best is,

247
00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:04.167
they're up here
on this plaque on the wall.

248
00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:07.420
The best driver and his RIO
from each class has his name on it.

249
00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:13.260
And they have the option to come
back here to be Top Gun instructors.

250
00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:18.348
You think your name's
gonna be on that plaque?

251
00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:21.226
Yes, sir.

252
00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.938
That's pretty arrogant,
considering the company you're in.

253
00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:29.526
Yes, sir.

254
00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:32.612
I like that in a pilot.

255
00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.367
Just remember, when it's over out there,
we're all on the same team.

256
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.206
Gentlemen, this school is about combat.

257
00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:46.084
There are no points for second place.

258
00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:48.712
Dismissed.

259
00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:49.963
Nice going.

260
00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:56.636
The plaque for the alternates is
down in the ladies' room.

261
00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:03.143
Oh, Jesus. Oh, you kill me.
You really do.

262
00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:08.315
No, no, no, no.
There's two O's in "Goose," boys.

263
00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:18.908
Hi.

264
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.123
This is what I call a target-rich environment.

265
00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.667
You live your life between your legs, Mav.

266
00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.503
Goose, even you could get laid
in a place like this.

267
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.007
I'm telling you, I'd be happy to find a girl
who'd talk dirty to me.

268
00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.180
Mav,

269
00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:41.848
you want to know who the best is?

270
00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:43.850
That's him. Iceman.

271
00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:47.937
That's the way he flies,
ice-cold, no mistakes.

272
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:50.607
Just wears you down.
You get bored, frustrated,

273
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.650
do something stupid, and he's got you.

274
00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:55.779
Hey, hey, Slider.

275
00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.734
Thought you wanted to be a pilot, man.
What happened?

276
00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:00.200
Goose, you're such a dickhead.

277
00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:01.677
Whose butt did you kiss to get in here?

278
00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:03.787
Well, the list is long but distinguished.

279
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.455
Yeah, well, so is my johnson.

280
00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:08.625
- So you're flying with Iceman?
- It's Mr. Iceman to you.

281
00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.294
- Hey, Mother Goose. How's it going?
- Good, Tom.

282
00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:14.047
This is Pete Mitchell. Tom Kazansky.

283
00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:16.674
- Congratulations on Top Gun.
- Thank you.

284
00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:18.134
Sorry to hear about Cougar.

285
00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:19.978
He and I were like brothers
in flight school.

286
00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:22.389
- He was a good man.
- Still is a good man.

287
00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:23.848
Yeah, that's what I meant.

288
00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:27.394
- Thought so.
- Say, you need any help?

289
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.188
With what?

290
00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:31.898
You figured it out yet?

291
00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:34.484
What's that?

292
00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:36.736
Who's the best pilot.

293
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.572
No, I think I can figure that one out on my own.

294
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.991
I heard that about you.

295
00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:43.243
You like to work alone.

296
00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:48.498
Mav, you must've soloed under a lucky star?

297
00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:51.265
I mean, first the MiG, and then you guys
slide into Cougar's spot.

298
00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:53.837
We didn't slide into Cougar's spot.
It was ours, okay?

299
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.880
Yeah, well, some pilots wait their whole career 
just to see a MiG up close.

300
00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.092
Guess you guys are lucky and famous?

301
00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:00.677
No, you mean notorious.

302
00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:02.762
I'll see you later.

303
00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:04.764
You can count on it.

304
00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.684
They were abused children.

305
00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:11.938
- We're gonna have a good time.
- Always.

306
00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:18.027
Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?

307
00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:20.613
All right, the bet is $20.

308
00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:21.948
- $20.
- Right.

309
00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:23.783
You have to have carnal knowledge,

310
00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:25.452
of a lady this time

311
00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:28.204
- on the premises.
- On the premises.

312
00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:32.208
Come on, Mav. A bet's a bet.

313
00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:36.045
I don't know, it just...
It just doesn't seem fair.

314
00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:37.213
For you, I mean.

315
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.465
But...

316
00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:41.259
...she's lost that loving feeling.

317
00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:42.469
She's lost...

318
00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:43.887
- No, she hasn't.
- Yes, she has.

319
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.781
- She has not lost that...
- Goose, she's lost it.

320
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:46.890
Mav. Come on.

321
00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:50.268
I hate it when she does that. Shit.

322
00:21:55.857 --> 00:21:57.734
- Excuse me, miss.
- Hey, hey, hey.

323
00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:59.527
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.

00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:04.217
I've never seen that approach.

346
00:23:04.342 --> 00:23:05.760
<i>♪ If you would only love me... ♪</i>..

347
00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:07.525
How long have you two
been doing this act?

348
00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:09.389
Oh, I don't know, since...

349
00:23:09.556 --> 00:23:11.724
Puberty?
Right, puberty.

350
00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:15.061
- I'm Charlotte Blackwood.
- I'm Maverick.

351
00:23:15.436 --> 00:23:16.521
Maverick?

352
00:23:17.438 --> 00:23:19.399
Did your mother not like you
or something?

353
00:23:19.524 --> 00:23:21.192
No, it's my callsign.

354
00:23:21.609 --> 00:23:24.612
- You're a pilot.
- That's right, a naval aviator.

355
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.322
Oh.

356
00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:29.158
No, actually, we've only done this, twice.

357
00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:30.743
Oh, how'd you do?

358
00:23:32.078 --> 00:23:34.455
Crashed and burnt on the first one.
It wasn't pretty.

359
00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:38.001
- And second?
- I don't know. I'll tell you tomorrow.

360
00:23:38.084 --> 00:23:39.961
But it's looking good so far.

361
00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:45.133
Well, uh, Maverick,

362
00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:48.761
my friend's just arrived,
so it's been great talking to you.

363
00:23:49.095 --> 00:23:50.221
- Perry.
- Hi.

364
00:23:50.305 --> 00:23:51.472
Hi. Here you go.

365
00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:53.975
Oh, I'll be with you
in just a second, okay?

366
00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:59.647
Listen, can I ask you
a personal question?

367
00:24:00.315 --> 00:24:01.566
That depends.

368
00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:05.945
Are you a good pilot?

369
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:08.448
I can hold my own.

370
00:24:09.115 --> 00:24:10.116
Great.

371
00:24:11.242 --> 00:24:14.746
Then I won't have to worry about you
making your living as a singer.

372
00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:24.631
I'm gonna need a beer
to put these flames out. Yo!

373
00:24:25.673 --> 00:24:27.967
Great, Mav. Real slick.

374
00:24:52.367 --> 00:24:55.828
- It was a long cruise, was it, sailor?
- It was too long.

375
00:24:56.663 --> 00:24:59.916
What did you wanna do, just drop
right down on the tile and go for it?

376
00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:02.835
No, I actually had...

377
00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:04.671
Had this counter in mind.

378
00:25:05.546 --> 00:25:08.049
Great, that would be
very, very comfortable. Yeah.

379
00:25:08.174 --> 00:25:09.384
It could be.

380
00:25:12.387 --> 00:25:15.056
Actually, I came in here
to save you from

381
00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:18.601
making a big mistake
with that older guy.

382
00:25:19.352 --> 00:25:20.353
Really?

383
00:25:21.396 --> 00:25:25.108
So I could go on to a bigger one
with a young guy like yourself?

384
00:25:27.694 --> 00:25:28.695
Maybe.

385
00:25:29.696 --> 00:25:30.738
No?

386
00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:32.990
I've gotta be at work
very early in the morning.

387
00:25:33.074 --> 00:25:34.367
Then what are you doing here?

388
00:25:36.202 --> 00:25:37.870
Your friend was magnificent.

389
00:25:43.584 --> 00:25:44.919
Nah.

390
00:25:47.213 --> 00:25:50.717
Now, you'll also be trained and
evaluated by a few civilian specialists.

391
00:25:51.217 --> 00:25:53.570
The civilians are here because
they are our very best source

392
00:25:53.594 --> 00:25:55.304
of information on enemy aircraft.

393
00:25:55.972 --> 00:25:58.266
One of the most qualified
is our TAGREP,

394
00:25:58.391 --> 00:25:59.767
callsign, Charlie.

395
00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:02.019
She has a Ph.D. in astrophysics,

396
00:26:02.103 --> 00:26:03.771
and she's also a civilian contractor,

397
00:26:03.896 --> 00:26:05.523
so you do not salute her.

398
00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:06.766
But you better listen to her,

399
00:26:06.816 --> 00:26:09.152
because the Pentagon listens to her
about your proficiency.

400
00:26:09.444 --> 00:26:11.237
- It's all yours, Charlie.
- Thank you.

401
00:26:13.239 --> 00:26:14.282
Hello.

402
00:26:14.407 --> 00:26:17.577
We will be dealing with F-5s and A-4s

403
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.162
as our MiG simulators.

404
00:26:19.454 --> 00:26:21.456
Now, then, as most of you know,

405
00:26:21.748 --> 00:26:24.375
the F-5 doesn't have
the thrust-to-weight ratio

406
00:26:24.459 --> 00:26:25.960
that the MiG-28 has.

407
00:26:26.627 --> 00:26:28.963
And it doesn't bleed energy
below 300 knots,

408
00:26:29.088 --> 00:26:30.423
like the MiG-28.

409
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:31.632
However,

410
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:36.137
the MiG-28 does have a problem
with its inverted flight tanks.

411
00:26:36.596 --> 00:26:39.307
It won't do a negative-G pushover.

412
00:26:39.599 --> 00:26:41.076
- The latest intelligence...
- Are you gonna tell her?

413
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.911
- ...tells us that the most it will do...
- Nothing.

414
00:26:42.935 --> 00:26:44.645
...is one negative...

415
00:26:45.646 --> 00:26:47.273
Excuse me, lieutenant.

416
00:26:48.107 --> 00:26:49.442
Is there something wrong?

417
00:26:49.525 --> 00:26:52.153
Yes, ma'am, the data
on the MiG is inaccurate.

418
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.156
How's that, lieutenant?

419
00:26:56.032 --> 00:26:57.909
Well, I just happened to see
a MiG-28 do...

420
00:26:57.992 --> 00:26:59.327
We, we.

421
00:26:59.452 --> 00:27:00.661
Sorry, Goose.

422
00:27:00.787 --> 00:27:04.957
We happened to see a MiG-28
do a four-G negative dive.

423
00:27:06.167 --> 00:27:07.877
Where did you see this?

424
00:27:09.003 --> 00:27:10.171
That's classified.

425
00:27:10.338 --> 00:27:11.464
It's what?

426
00:27:12.006 --> 00:27:13.382
It's classified.

427
00:27:13.883 --> 00:27:15.611
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

428
00:27:15.635 --> 00:27:18.304
Lieutenant, I have top-secret clearance.

429
00:27:18.846 --> 00:27:21.808
The Pentagon sees to it
that I know more than you.

430
00:27:23.518 --> 00:27:26.521
Well, ma'am, it doesn't seem so
in this case, now, does it?

431
00:27:27.355 --> 00:27:28.731
So, lieutenant,

432
00:27:29.482 --> 00:27:31.400
where exactly were you?

433
00:27:32.819 --> 00:27:34.654
- Well, we...
- Thank you.

434
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:37.532
...started up on his 6
when he pulled through the clouds,

435
00:27:37.657 --> 00:27:38.801
and then I moved in above him.

436
00:27:38.825 --> 00:27:40.743
Well, if you were directly above him,

437
00:27:40.827 --> 00:27:42.411
how could you see him?

438
00:27:43.162 --> 00:27:44.372
Because I was inverted.

439
00:27:44.497 --> 00:27:45.665
Bullshit.

440
00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:49.168
No, he was, man.
It was a really great move.

441
00:27:49.252 --> 00:27:50.878
He was inverted.

442
00:27:51.838 --> 00:27:53.422
You were in a four-G

443
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:56.384
inverted dive with a MiG-28?

444
00:27:56.717 --> 00:27:59.512
- Yes, ma'am.
- At what range?

445
00:27:59.595 --> 00:28:01.556
No. About two meters.

446
00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:03.558
It was actually about
one and a half, I think.

447
00:28:03.683 --> 00:28:05.536
It was one and a half.
I've got a great Polaroid of it.

448
00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.870
He's right there.
It must be one and a half.

449
00:28:06.894 --> 00:28:07.937
It was a nice picture.

450
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.063
Lieutenant.

451
00:28:09.188 --> 00:28:10.268
Thanks, I like my pictures.

452
00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:13.734
What were you doing there?

453
00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:16.946
- Communicating.
- Communicating.

454
00:28:17.405 --> 00:28:20.074
Keeping up foreign relations. I was,

455
00:28:20.533 --> 00:28:22.368
you know, giving him the bird.

456
00:28:23.953 --> 00:28:26.706
- You know, the finger.
- Yes, I know the finger, Goose.

457
00:28:26.873 --> 00:28:29.250
I'm sorry, I hate it when it does that.
I'm sorry.

458
00:28:30.585 --> 00:28:31.711
Excuse me.

459
00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:34.255
So you're the one.

460
00:28:35.298 --> 00:28:36.424
Yes, ma'am.

461
00:28:37.758 --> 00:28:39.886
All right, gentlemen,
we have a hop to take.

462
00:28:40.636 --> 00:28:42.513
The hard deck on this hop
will be 10,000 feet.

463
00:28:42.597 --> 00:28:44.432
There'll be no engagement below that.

464
00:28:45.266 --> 00:28:46.559
Move it!

465
00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:49.812
...disappear like that.

466
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.773
Lieutenant.

467
00:28:54.775 --> 00:28:56.485
Okay, well, don't be late again.

468
00:28:56.611 --> 00:28:58.171
- You look great, honey.
- Thanks, dear.

469
00:28:58.321 --> 00:28:59.614
See you in preflight.

470
00:29:00.114 --> 00:29:02.074
Lieutenant, why didn't you tell me

471
00:29:02.158 --> 00:29:04.118
that you were a famous MiG insulter?

472
00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:07.788
- Would it have made any difference?
- Not in the ladies' room, no.

473
00:29:08.414 --> 00:29:09.790
And what would've?

474
00:29:10.333 --> 00:29:11.959
I'm an instructor at this school.

475
00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:14.545
I see 20 new hotshots
every eight weeks.

476
00:29:14.629 --> 00:29:16.631
Now, I'm sure you can figure that out.

477
00:29:17.298 --> 00:29:18.633
Look, lieutenant.

478
00:29:19.675 --> 00:29:22.595
I'd just really like to hear
about the MiG sometime.

479
00:29:23.638 --> 00:29:25.598
You've got security clearance.

480
00:29:26.307 --> 00:29:28.100
You can read about it.

481
00:29:33.773 --> 00:29:34.982
Maverick.

482
00:29:36.817 --> 00:29:38.152
I'm curious.

483
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.490
Who was covering Cougar

484
00:29:42.615 --> 00:29:44.992
while you were showboating
with this MiG?

485
00:29:45.826 --> 00:29:47.662
Cougar was doing just fine.

486
00:29:50.122 --> 00:29:51.666
<i>Gentlemen, this is your first hop.</i>

487
00:29:51.791 --> 00:29:53.084
<i>The jets you are flying against</i>

488
00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:55.544
<i>are smaller, faster
and more maneuverable,</i>

489
00:29:55.628 --> 00:29:56.837
<i>just like the enemy MiGs.</i>

490
00:29:56.963 --> 00:29:59.799
<i>The clock is ticking,
and as of now, we are keeping score.</i>

491
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.176
I lost him, Goose.

492
00:30:04.345 --> 00:30:05.805
Show me what you got, kid.

493
00:30:06.722 --> 00:30:09.141
- I lost him.
- I'm looking, I'm looking.

494
00:30:11.644 --> 00:30:13.684
I got him, I got him.
He's on our tail, coming hard.

495
00:30:13.729 --> 00:30:16.190
Yeah, I got him. I got him. Here we go.

496
00:30:29.078 --> 00:30:31.497
- All right, talk to me, Goose.
- He's still back there.

497
00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.332
<i>He's closing in on us. He's closing fast.</i>

498
00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:36.252
You can run, kid, but you can't hide.

499
00:30:40.673 --> 00:30:43.473
Come on, Jester. Let's see if I can
give you a run for your money here.

500
00:30:49.765 --> 00:30:51.267
Watch the mountains.

501
00:31:01.777 --> 00:31:03.779
I still got him. He's still back there.

502
00:31:03.863 --> 00:31:05.906
Come on, Mav.
Do some of that pilot shit.

503
00:31:06.032 --> 00:31:07.366
Yeah, I got him.

504
00:31:17.418 --> 00:31:19.128
Come on, bring it right.

505
00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:22.019
Goose, I've had about enough
of this shit.

506
00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:26.010
I'm gonna hit the brakes,
he'll fly right by.

507
00:31:26.093 --> 00:31:27.595
Okay, you're mine.

508
00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:37.229
Jesus Christ.

509
00:31:40.566 --> 00:31:42.318
Let's see what you've got now, Jester.

510
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.820
Okay, Mav, let's turn and burn.

511
00:32:02.922 --> 00:32:04.548
He's going vertical, so am I.

512
00:32:04.632 --> 00:32:06.926
We're going ballistic, Mav. Go get him.

513
00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:17.579
He's going for the hard deck.

514
00:32:17.603 --> 00:32:19.688
Let's get down there first
and nail him, Mav.

515
00:32:19.772 --> 00:32:21.774
No way, Jester. You're mine.

516
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:40.042
I got you now.

517
00:32:43.546 --> 00:32:44.839
Jester's dead.

518
00:32:45.631 --> 00:32:47.550
Jester's dead.

519
00:32:50.469 --> 00:32:53.180
Get your butts above the hard deck
and return to base immediately.

520
00:32:57.184 --> 00:32:58.727
Yes, sir.

521
00:33:04.984 --> 00:33:07.695
Tower, this is Ghost Rider
requesting a flyby.

522
00:33:08.863 --> 00:33:11.031
Negative, Ghost Rider,
the pattern is full.

523
00:33:11.323 --> 00:33:13.492
No. No, Mav. This is not a good idea.

524
00:33:14.034 --> 00:33:16.912
Sorry, Goose
but it's time to buzz the tower.

525
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.843
Goddamn son of a bitch.

526
00:33:35.723 --> 00:33:37.349
<i>Great balls of fire!</i>

527
00:33:40.561 --> 00:33:41.729
Jester's dead.

528
00:33:41.854 --> 00:33:43.939
You won? That's bullshit.

529
00:33:44.023 --> 00:33:46.692
- Didn't everybody?
- Hell, no, man, we got our butts kicked.

530
00:33:47.067 --> 00:33:50.029
Thirty seconds.
We went like this, he went like that.

531
00:33:50.196 --> 00:33:51.947
I said to Hollywood, "Where'd he go?"

532
00:33:52.031 --> 00:33:54.783
Hollywood just said, "Where'd who go?"

533
00:33:55.201 --> 00:33:57.846
Yeah, and he's laughing at us,
right on the radio. He's laughing at us.

534
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.538
No, it's me laughing, dickhead.

535
00:33:59.622 --> 00:34:00.664
We won.

536
00:34:00.748 --> 00:34:01.790
- All right!
- All right!

537
00:34:01.874 --> 00:34:03.000
- All right.
- All right.

538
00:34:03.083 --> 00:34:04.418
They won too, man.

539
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.003
That's not what I heard.

540
00:34:06.086 --> 00:34:09.006
- No, we did, we got Jester.
- No, no.

541
00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:10.489
Below the hard deck does not count.

542
00:34:10.549 --> 00:34:11.759
Hard deck, my ass.

543
00:34:11.884 --> 00:34:13.427
We nailed that son of a bitch.

544
00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:14.929
You guys really are cowboys.

545
00:34:15.054 --> 00:34:16.889
What's your problem, Kazansky?

546
00:34:18.766 --> 00:34:20.226
You're everyone's problem.

547
00:34:20.893 --> 00:34:23.333
That's because every time
you go up in the air, you're unsafe.

548
00:34:23.729 --> 00:34:25.369
I don't like you
because you're dangerous.

549
00:34:25.397 --> 00:34:26.607
That's right.

550
00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:29.151
Iceman.

551
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:31.320
I am dangerous.

552
00:34:34.406 --> 00:34:35.491
Maverick.

553
00:34:36.242 --> 00:34:37.886
You and Goose get your butts
out of that flight gear

554
00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.453
and up to Viper's office now.

555
00:34:43.457 --> 00:34:45.042
Remember, boys,

556
00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:46.919
no points for second place.

557
00:34:48.087 --> 00:34:50.106
- You're a lot brighter than you look.
- Oh, you shut up, okay?

558
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:52.132
- Don't worry. Goose, don't worry.
- Okay, I will.

559
00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:55.219
Two of your snot-nosed jockeys
did a flyby on my tower

560
00:34:55.302 --> 00:34:56.637
at over 400 knots!

561
00:34:56.971 --> 00:34:59.974
I want somebody's butt. I want it now.
I've had it.

562
00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:03.060
- Oh!
- God damn it!

563
00:35:03.143 --> 00:35:04.645
That's twice.

564
00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:06.146
I want some butts!

565
00:35:07.815 --> 00:35:10.442
Well, that'll just about cover the flybys.

566
00:35:11.694 --> 00:35:13.112
Follow me.

567
00:35:17.616 --> 00:35:18.951
Gentlemen.

568
00:35:20.786 --> 00:35:23.038
You had a hell of a first day.

569
00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:29.211
The hard deck for this hop
was 10,000 feet.

570
00:35:29.795 --> 00:35:31.505
You knew it, you broke it.

571
00:35:32.047 --> 00:35:33.799
You followed
Commander Heatherly below

572
00:35:33.882 --> 00:35:36.468
after he lost sight of you
and called no joy.

573
00:35:38.554 --> 00:35:40.639
“Why?
"Sir!"

574
00:35:41.348 --> 00:35:44.184
I had Commander Heatherly
in my sights.

575
00:35:45.144 --> 00:35:46.478
He saw me move in for the kill.

576
00:35:46.562 --> 00:35:49.231
He then proceeded
below the hard deck.

577
00:35:49.982 --> 00:35:52.901
We weren't below 10,000
for more than a few seconds.

578
00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:54.653
I had the shot,

579
00:35:54.737 --> 00:35:57.531
there was no danger, so I took it.

580
00:35:58.657 --> 00:35:59.825
You took it.

581
00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:02.703
And broke a major rule of engagement.

582
00:36:03.704 --> 00:36:04.872
Then you broke another one

583
00:36:04.997 --> 00:36:06.915
with that circus-stunt flyby.

584
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:11.420
Lieutenant Mitchell.

585
00:36:11.503 --> 00:36:13.839
Top Gun rules of engagement
exist for your safety

586
00:36:13.922 --> 00:36:15.257
and for that of your team.

587
00:36:15.507 --> 00:36:17.509
They are not flexible, nor am l.

588
00:36:18.761 --> 00:36:21.513
Either obey them or you're history.
Is that clear?

589
00:36:23.849 --> 00:36:24.892
Yes, sir!

590
00:36:33.859 --> 00:36:34.943
Dismissed.

591
00:36:40.616 --> 00:36:42.701
I really enjoyed that, Mav, thanks a lot.

592
00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:44.703
Holy shit.

593
00:36:49.583 --> 00:36:51.543
Maybe I could learn how
to be a truck driver.

594
00:36:51.877 --> 00:36:54.105
Mav, you have the number of that
truck-driving school we saw on TV?

595
00:36:54.129 --> 00:36:55.547
Truck Master, I think it is.

596
00:36:55.923 --> 00:36:57.132
I might need that.

597
00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.968
His fitness report says it all.

598
00:37:00.302 --> 00:37:01.637
He's a wild card.

599
00:37:02.304 --> 00:37:03.406
Flies by the seat of his pants.

600
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:04.723
Completely unpredictable.

601
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.643
He got you, didn't he?

602
00:37:09.478 --> 00:37:10.562
Yeah.

603
00:37:10.979 --> 00:37:12.106
Maverick.

604
00:37:13.941 --> 00:37:15.317
I flew with his old man.

605
00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:20.948
Tell me one thing.

606
00:37:21.824 --> 00:37:24.118
If you had to go into battle,
would you want him with you?

607
00:37:24.243 --> 00:37:25.411
I don't know.

608
00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:27.413
I just don't know.

609
00:37:40.342 --> 00:37:43.303
- You still awake?
- Yeah.

610
00:37:46.432 --> 00:37:47.516
What's up?

611
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.685
Can't sleep.

612
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.165
You know, when I first realized
that we were going to Top Gun,

613
00:37:54.189 --> 00:37:56.358
all I could think about
was getting that trophy.

614
00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.863
I gotta be straight with you, Mav.

615
00:38:02.114 --> 00:38:04.199
Right now, I just hope we graduate.

616
00:38:06.368 --> 00:38:07.568
I got a family to think about.

617
00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:09.288
I can't afford to blow this.

618
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.129
Yeah, I guess that flyby wasn't
such a big hit, huh?

619
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.469
Look, man, I know it's tough for you.

620
00:38:24.052 --> 00:38:25.155
They wouldn't let you in the academy

621
00:38:25.179 --> 00:38:26.972
because you're Duke Mitchell's kid and

622
00:38:27.848 --> 00:38:29.808
you have to live with that reputation.

623
00:38:30.225 --> 00:38:31.894
But it's like every time we go up there,

624
00:38:31.977 --> 00:38:34.062
it's like you're flying against a ghost.

625
00:38:36.148 --> 00:38:37.983
It makes me nervous.

626
00:38:42.863 --> 00:38:44.490
You're the only family I've got.

627
00:38:45.574 --> 00:38:47.659
I'm not gonna let you down.
I promise you.

628
00:38:57.836 --> 00:38:59.046
Get out of here.

629
00:39:16.355 --> 00:39:19.066
A rolling reversal would work well
in that situation.

630
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.780
But if I reversed on a hard cross,
I could immediately go to guns on them.

631
00:39:24.863 --> 00:39:27.032
Yeah, but at that speed, it's too fast.

632
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:30.202
It's a little bit too aggressive.

633
00:39:31.453 --> 00:39:32.871
Too aggressive.

634
00:39:35.207 --> 00:39:36.518
Yeah, I guess when I see something,

635
00:39:36.542 --> 00:39:37.751
I go right after it.

636
00:39:39.878 --> 00:39:41.758
You didn't tell me who you were
the other night.

637
00:39:42.297 --> 00:39:44.424
You didn't give me a chance, did you?

638
00:39:45.092 --> 00:39:46.468
You deserved it.

639
00:39:47.761 --> 00:39:48.804
I know.

640
00:39:49.388 --> 00:39:50.472
But

641
00:39:51.056 --> 00:39:52.558
you were tempted

642
00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.394
to ask me out for dinner.

643
00:39:56.395 --> 00:39:58.063
- No.
- No?

644
00:39:58.146 --> 00:39:59.231
No.

645
00:39:59.565 --> 00:40:01.233
I don't date students.

646
00:40:10.826 --> 00:40:12.911
I can see it's dangerous for you.

647
00:40:13.412 --> 00:40:15.247
But if the government trusts me,

648
00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:18.625
maybe you could.

649
00:40:25.757 --> 00:40:28.176
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.

650
00:40:42.441 --> 00:40:44.443
Crash and burn, huh, Mav?

651
00:40:48.614 --> 00:40:49.615
Slider,

652
00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:54.119
you stink.

653
00:41:04.504 --> 00:41:05.547
Let's go.

654
00:41:05.631 --> 00:41:07.049
Okay, Ice, yeah.

655
00:41:09.301 --> 00:41:10.302
All set.

656
00:41:11.887 --> 00:41:13.347
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

657
00:41:13.472 --> 00:41:14.514
Back up, back up.

658
00:41:18.185 --> 00:41:19.311
Here it comes.

659
00:41:20.187 --> 00:41:21.271
That's good.

660
00:41:21.355 --> 00:41:22.397
Come on.

661
00:41:23.649 --> 00:41:24.650
Let's go, now.

662
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.162
Come on, Mav, let's get them.

663
00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.706
Those guys are animals.

664
00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:44.920
Let's go!

665
00:41:46.171 --> 00:41:47.214
Go!

666
00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:48.674
Oh, good serve, good serve.

667
00:41:55.222 --> 00:41:56.348
All right!

668
00:41:57.432 --> 00:41:58.517
Yes!

669
00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:01.061
Yeah!

670
00:42:12.864 --> 00:42:14.199
That's game.

671
00:42:15.701 --> 00:42:18.495
Okay. Fake block.
Stay down. We'll just take them.

672
00:42:18.578 --> 00:42:19.705
Okay.

673
00:42:22.207 --> 00:42:24.418
Come on, where you guys going?
You walking away?

674
00:42:24.543 --> 00:42:26.336
We won, we won. Come on!

675
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.046
Mav. Mav. Come on, man.

676
00:42:28.547 --> 00:42:29.857
Just one more game. That evens it up.

677
00:42:29.881 --> 00:42:31.425
- Come on, we can take them.
- No.

678
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:32.551
No, we can, we got it.

679
00:42:32.634 --> 00:42:34.194
I got some things I gotta take care of.

680
00:42:34.261 --> 00:42:36.054
Take care of? Just one more game.

681
00:42:36.722 --> 00:42:38.056
Please? For me?

682
00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.220
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.

683
00:42:39.266 --> 00:42:40.308
- Come on.
- Come on!

684
00:42:40.392 --> 00:42:41.893
- Mother Goose, you pussy!
- For me?

685
00:43:14.968 --> 00:43:16.136
Damn it.

686
00:43:28.607 --> 00:43:29.775
Lieutenant?

687
00:43:34.654 --> 00:43:37.616
- Yeah...
- What, no singing?

688
00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:42.496
- Look, I'm... I'm...
- No apologies.

689
00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:52.005
If you don't mind, I'm...

690
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:53.357
I'm gonna just take a quick shower

691
00:43:53.381 --> 00:43:55.842
while you're finishing up here.

692
00:43:57.719 --> 00:43:59.346
Yeah, I do mind.

693
00:44:00.806 --> 00:44:02.349
I'm hungry-

694
00:44:05.644 --> 00:44:06.812
And then.

695
00:44:07.479 --> 00:44:08.897
I thought about it.

696
00:44:09.648 --> 00:44:10.816
H Waugh-tn,

697
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.319
"You know, Charlie, he's a smart guy."

698
00:44:15.403 --> 00:44:17.697
"Why don't you just tell him
why you've got him here."

699
00:44:19.366 --> 00:44:20.659
Well?

700
00:44:21.993 --> 00:44:23.495
It's the MiG.

701
00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:28.750
The MiG.

702
00:44:29.709 --> 00:44:32.671
You're the only pilot
who's been up against a MiG-28.

703
00:44:36.007 --> 00:44:37.687
I'm trying for this big promotion at work,

704
00:44:37.759 --> 00:44:39.886
and if I get it,
I'm not gonna be here much longer.

705
00:44:41.596 --> 00:44:44.015
It seems to me you've got it
all figured out.

706
00:44:44.432 --> 00:44:45.892
Yeah.

707
00:44:47.394 --> 00:44:49.354
Except you did forget the wine.

708
00:44:50.522 --> 00:44:51.606
Oh.

709
00:44:52.691 --> 00:44:54.359
Sorry.

710
00:44:55.402 --> 00:44:57.028
You always get what you want?

711
00:44:57.195 --> 00:44:58.530
No, not always.

712
00:44:59.698 --> 00:45:01.199
Yeah, maybe.

713
00:45:01.283 --> 00:45:03.034
Then relax about the MiG.

714
00:45:18.717 --> 00:45:19.885
This music.

715
00:45:22.637 --> 00:45:24.055
An old friend?

716
00:45:26.224 --> 00:45:27.267
My folks loved it.

717
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.061
I haven't heard this in years.

718
00:45:32.397 --> 00:45:34.816
My mother used to
call down from her room

719
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.569
and have me play this
over and over again.

720
00:45:37.736 --> 00:45:39.779
I got so sick of it.

721
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.742
But not her, she...

722
00:45:44.784 --> 00:45:47.495
Just sit up there alone,
just listening, hours.

723
00:45:49.122 --> 00:45:50.415
Just listening.

724
00:45:53.001 --> 00:45:56.087
She died shortly after him.

725
00:45:56.588 --> 00:45:57.923
What happened to your father?

726
00:46:03.929 --> 00:46:07.057
I guess I kind of figured,
with your security clearance,

727
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.643
you'd know more about him than I do.

728
00:46:11.436 --> 00:46:13.939
- Well, I didn't get that far.
- Oh.

729
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:17.651
Well, it's a big mystery.

730
00:46:19.819 --> 00:46:24.282
He disappeared in an F-4,
November 5th, 1965.

731
00:46:27.285 --> 00:46:28.787
The stink of it was,

732
00:46:29.621 --> 00:46:31.498
he screwed up.

733
00:46:32.666 --> 00:46:33.708
No way.

734
00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.711
My old man was a great fighter pilot.

735
00:46:41.007 --> 00:46:44.219
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.

736
00:46:47.347 --> 00:46:48.807
Somebody must know.

737
00:46:49.474 --> 00:46:51.476
Yeah, somebody knows everything.

738
00:46:52.352 --> 00:46:54.813
Is that why you're always
second best up there?

739
00:46:57.023 --> 00:46:58.316
You are direct, aren't you?

740
00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:09.160
I'm sorry I was late.

741
00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:13.707
I'm sorry for being direct.

742
00:47:14.541 --> 00:47:16.042
No apologies.

743
00:47:18.878 --> 00:47:20.714
This is gonna be complicated.

744
00:47:33.184 --> 00:47:34.686
Where are you going?

745
00:47:36.229 --> 00:47:37.731
I'm gonna take a shower.

746
00:47:42.027 --> 00:47:43.069
Thank you.

747
00:47:44.029 --> 00:47:45.739
I enjoyed being here.

748
00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.988
It looks like you need another shower.

749
00:48:28.948 --> 00:48:29.991
Right.

750
00:48:36.664 --> 00:48:38.249
I'm gonna be honest with you.

751
00:48:40.627 --> 00:48:43.755
Your MiG sighting is really
important to my work, but...

752
00:48:49.511 --> 00:48:52.263
I don't normally invite
students to my house.

753
00:48:53.348 --> 00:48:54.808
You're...

754
00:49:02.774 --> 00:49:05.443
But... Please understand,
I still have a job to do.

755
00:49:07.987 --> 00:49:09.030
- Morning.
- Sir.

756
00:49:09.114 --> 00:49:10.448
Morning.

757
00:49:32.512 --> 00:49:34.848
I'm glad we got that straight.

758
00:49:53.449 --> 00:49:55.493
I told her how tough it is here.

759
00:49:55.702 --> 00:49:58.580
You know, my ass dragging
like an old, tired dog.

760
00:49:58.663 --> 00:50:00.623
I told her that you didn't
even have a woman here.

761
00:50:00.665 --> 00:50:01.666
Oh, really.

762
00:50:01.833 --> 00:50:02.876
You know what she said?

763
00:50:03.001 --> 00:50:04.601
Said, "Oh, he probably
doesn't have one",

764
00:50:04.669 --> 00:50:05.837
"he's got eight."

765
00:50:13.011 --> 00:50:15.680
Hi!
Daddy!

766
00:50:21.978 --> 00:50:23.188
So, Maverick,

767
00:50:23.479 --> 00:50:26.733
Goose tells me you're in love
with one of your instructors.

768
00:50:26.858 --> 00:50:29.402
- Is that right?
- I didn't tell her that.

769
00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:30.987
- Yes, you did.
- L...

770
00:50:31.196 --> 00:50:32.715
- Yes, you did.
- I can't believe you said that.

771
00:50:32.739 --> 00:50:34.574
- That was a secret.
- No.

772
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:42.957
The bogey has good position right here.

773
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:44.751
All right, freeze-frame.

774
00:50:45.084 --> 00:50:46.502
Moment of choice.

775
00:50:46.711 --> 00:50:48.546
The F-14 is defensive.

776
00:50:48.838 --> 00:50:50.715
He has a chance to bug out right here.

777
00:50:51.216 --> 00:50:54.427
Better to retire and save your aircraft

778
00:50:55.261 --> 00:50:57.013
than push a bad position.

779
00:50:57.597 --> 00:50:59.557
Charlie, jump in here anytime.

780
00:51:00.099 --> 00:51:02.393
Now, you stay in that diamond
another three seconds,

781
00:51:02.769 --> 00:51:05.230
the bogey's gonna blow you
out of the sky.

782
00:51:05.355 --> 00:51:08.316
You take a hard right, select zone five,

783
00:51:08.399 --> 00:51:10.360
you can extend an escape.

784
00:51:11.361 --> 00:51:13.529
You made a bad choice.

785
00:51:14.614 --> 00:51:15.740
Charlie.

786
00:51:18.201 --> 00:51:20.912
Aircraft one performs a split S?

787
00:51:21.412 --> 00:51:23.373
That's the last thing you should do.

788
00:51:23.581 --> 00:51:25.208
The MiG's right on your tail.

789
00:51:25.291 --> 00:51:26.876
Freeze there, please.

790
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:31.047
The MiG has you in his gunsight.
What were you thinking at this point?

791
00:51:31.923 --> 00:51:34.008
You don't have time to think up there.

792
00:51:34.092 --> 00:51:35.510
If you think,

793
00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:36.761
you're dead.

794
00:51:36.928 --> 00:51:38.054
Well, that's a big gamble

795
00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:40.390
with a $30 million plane, lieutenant.

796
00:51:47.897 --> 00:51:49.774
Unfortunately, the gamble worked.

797
00:51:49.941 --> 00:51:51.901
The MiG never got a clean shot.

798
00:51:53.152 --> 00:51:55.780
Maverick makes
an aggressive vertical move here,

799
00:51:55.905 --> 00:51:59.158
comes over the top, and he defeats
the bandit with a missile shot.

800
00:52:00.118 --> 00:52:01.828
The encounter was a victory,

801
00:52:01.953 --> 00:52:06.165
but I think that we've shown it
as an example of what not to do.

802
00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:08.793
Next.

803
00:52:09.919 --> 00:52:11.796
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.

804
00:52:15.925 --> 00:52:20.138
Now, then, this is a perfect example
of a textbook maneuver.

805
00:52:33.318 --> 00:52:34.485
Lieutenant.

806
00:52:39.115 --> 00:52:40.616
Maverick.

807
00:52:43.036 --> 00:52:44.162
Lieutenant.

808
00:52:45.663 --> 00:52:47.123
Lieutenant.

809
00:52:47.957 --> 00:52:50.251
My review of your flight performance
in the TACTS

810
00:52:50.335 --> 00:52:52.295
was right on,
in my professional opinion.

811
00:52:53.129 --> 00:52:54.547
I can't hear you.

812
00:53:15.485 --> 00:53:16.903
Jesus Christ!

813
00:53:17.028 --> 00:53:18.196
And you think I'm reckless!

814
00:53:18.321 --> 00:53:19.506
When I fly, I'll have you know

815
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.908
that my crew and my plane come first!

816
00:53:22.033 --> 00:53:24.452
Well, I'm going to finish
my sentence, lieutenant.

817
00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:27.038
My review of your flight
performance was right on.

818
00:53:27.163 --> 00:53:28.915
- Is that right?
- That is right.

819
00:53:29.207 --> 00:53:30.583
But I held something back.

820
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.960
I see some real genius
in your flying, Maverick,

821
00:53:33.044 --> 00:53:34.545
but I can't say that in there.

822
00:53:34.712 --> 00:53:36.592
I was afraid that everyone
in that TACTS trailer

823
00:53:36.714 --> 00:53:38.216
would see right through me.

824
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:41.511
And I just don't want anyone to know
that I've fallen for you.

You hear about Ice?

841
00:55:31.954 --> 00:55:33.998
- What's that?
- He won another one.

842
00:55:34.665 --> 00:55:36.042
- Really?
- Yeah.

843
00:55:37.168 --> 00:55:38.544
I feel the need,

844
00:55:39.378 --> 00:55:41.839
- the need for speed.
- The need for speed.

845
00:55:46.052 --> 00:55:48.137

00:55:48.221 --> 00:55:50.473

00:55:55.144 --> 00:55:56.437
<i>First place, Iceman.</i>

850
00:55:56.521 --> 00:55:59.023
<i>Second place, Maverick,
just two points behind.</i>

851
00:56:00.858 --> 00:56:03.319
There they are.
Three miles, left, 10 o'clock.

852
00:56:03.402 --> 00:56:04.505
<i>L don't think they see us yet.</i>

853
00:56:04.529 --> 00:56:05.696
Okay, I see them.

854
00:56:05.863 --> 00:56:08.741
<i>Two A-4s, left 10 o'clock level,
continue left turn.</i>

855
00:56:18.042 --> 00:56:20.628
Good morning, gentlemen.
The temperatures 110 degrees.

856
00:56:20.711 --> 00:56:22.213
Holy shit, it's Viper.

857
00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:24.382
Viper's up here, great.

858
00:56:24.882 --> 00:56:26.050
Oh, shit.

859
00:56:26.551 --> 00:56:29.679
Great. He's probably saying,
"Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose."

860
00:56:29.762 --> 00:56:31.556
Yeah, I'm sure he's saying that.

861
00:56:35.184 --> 00:56:36.852
I've got my eye on the northern bogey.

862
00:56:36.936 --> 00:56:38.604
Roger. I got the southern guy.

863
00:56:41.065 --> 00:56:43.109
Hollywood, you've got the lead,
I'll cover you.

864
00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.456
Break now, Jester.

865
00:57:02.211 --> 00:57:04.547
Hollywood, we're losing Viper.
Let's just stay on Jester.

866
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:05.756
Roger, I'm on him.

867
00:57:09.885 --> 00:57:12.763
Goose, find Viper.
He's out there somewhere.

868
00:57:12.888 --> 00:57:15.725
Stay with Hollywood, Mav,
we're covering his wing.

869
00:57:17.435 --> 00:57:19.937
Goose, there's Viper. 3 o'clock, low.

870
00:57:20.104 --> 00:57:22.273
Stay with Hollywood, Mav.
We're his cover.

871
00:57:22.398 --> 00:57:24.108
Don't you leave me, Maverick.

872
00:57:24.442 --> 00:57:26.277
Hollywood, you're looking good.

873
00:57:26.777 --> 00:57:28.279
I'm going after Viper.

874
00:57:31.324 --> 00:57:32.950
God damn you, Maverick.

875
00:57:33.075 --> 00:57:34.368
Mav, don't leave him.

876
00:57:34.452 --> 00:57:37.330
Goose, Hollywood's okay. I want Viper.

877
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:43.336
Stand by. Viper's coming down.

878
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.638
Holy shit, we're head-to-head.
I can't believe we're doing this.

879
00:58:08.319 --> 00:58:09.320
Rock 'n' roll.

880
00:58:09.445 --> 00:58:11.489
Here's our chance.
It's a big one, Goose.

881
00:58:13.491 --> 00:58:15.159
Come on, God damn it.

882
00:58:18.996 --> 00:58:20.539
Come on, Mav, keep coming.

883
00:58:24.794 --> 00:58:26.754
Okay. Sidewinder missile selected.

884
00:58:26.837 --> 00:58:28.839
<i>Come on, baby. Come on, baby.</i>

885
00:58:28.964 --> 00:58:31.884
Come around, come around.
That's it, that's it.

886
00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:38.891
Jesus, this guy's good.

887
00:58:39.225 --> 00:58:41.018
<i>Goose, where's he going?</i>

888
00:58:41.143 --> 00:58:42.812
Come on, come on, come on,
keep coming.

889
00:58:42.895 --> 00:58:44.689
<i>Keep coming!</i>

890
00:58:48.025 --> 00:58:49.360
Come on, baby.

891
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:56.534
Damn, this kid's good.

892
00:58:58.035 --> 00:59:00.371
He's too close for missiles, Goose,
I'm switching to guns.

893
00:59:03.749 --> 00:59:05.543
Come on, come on, come on.

894
00:59:08.212 --> 00:59:10.673
Stick with me, stick with me.

895
00:59:14.051 --> 00:59:16.387
What... Hold it. Goose, check our tail.

896
00:59:16.512 --> 00:59:18.222
Shit. There's Jester.

897
00:59:18.514 --> 00:59:20.891
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.

898
00:59:21.016 --> 00:59:22.059
Shit.

899
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.062
The Defense Department
regrets to inform you

900
00:59:25.187 --> 00:59:27.732
that your sons are dead
because they were stupid.

901
00:59:28.566 --> 00:59:30.609
<i>Great balls of fire.</i>

902
00:59:31.235 --> 00:59:32.820
Okay, knock it off, gentlemen.

903
00:59:32.903 --> 00:59:34.613
Let's go home. Viper has the lead.

904
00:59:40.369 --> 00:59:42.371
Thirty seconds, Wolfman,
and I'm coming in.

905
00:59:43.289 --> 00:59:44.373
Shut up!

906
00:59:44.457 --> 00:59:45.750
God, buttnose!

907
00:59:46.584 --> 00:59:48.961
That was some of the best
flying I've seen yet,

908
00:59:49.086 --> 00:59:51.255
right up to the part where you got killed.

909
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:53.924
You never, never leave your wingman.

910
01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:02.600
Maverick,

911
01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:06.061
it's not your flying,

912
01:00:06.395 --> 01:00:07.813
it's your attitude.

913
01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:10.232
The enemy's dangerous,

914
01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:13.444
but right now
you're worse than the enemy.

915
01:00:13.986 --> 01:00:16.238
You're dangerous and foolish.

916
01:00:16.614 --> 01:00:19.742
You may not like the guys
flying with you, they may not like you,

917
01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:22.119
but whose side are you on?

918
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.964
Well, at least Viper got Iceman
before he got us.

919
01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.675
We still got a shot at it.

920
01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:40.137
That was stupid. I know better than that.

921
01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:43.307
It'll never happen again.

922
01:00:46.769 --> 01:00:48.145
I know.

923
01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:54.485
I know.

Maverick, would you go fetch him?

930
01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:51.041
- Doesn't he ever embarrass you?
- Goose? Hell, no.

931
01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:53.711
- Well, there was the time...
- Admiral's daughter.

932
01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:56.130
- What?
- Come on.

933
01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.718
He told me all about the time
you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.

934
01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:03.721
Did he? Well, that's great.

935
01:02:03.846 --> 01:02:05.446
He tells me about all of them, Maverick.

936
01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:09.727
How my little angel, Goose,
goes home early for church,

937
01:02:09.852 --> 01:02:13.063
and you, you always go home
with the hot women.

938
01:02:13.147 --> 01:02:14.565
All right, thank you, Carole.

939
01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:17.401
I'm gonna go embarrass myself
with Goose for a while.

940
01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:21.655

I would love to be able
to warn you off about Maverick,

946
01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:40.424
but I just love him to death.

947
01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:45.095
You know, I've known Pete
for a lot of years now, and...

948
01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:47.598
I'm telling you, one thing's for certain.

949
01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:50.017
There are hearts breaking wide open

950
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.894
all over the world tonight.

951
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.354
Why?

952
01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:55.564
Because unless you are a fool,

953
01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.775
that boy is off the market.

954
01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.526
He is 100 percent,

955
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:02.279
prime-time in love with you.

956
01:03:03.572 --> 01:03:05.783
Hey, Goose, you big stud!

957
01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.201
That's me, honey.

958
01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.370
Take me to bed or lose me forever.

959
01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:11.246
Show me the way home, honey.

960
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:15.292

967
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:55.666

01:05:02.191 --> 01:05:03.734
It's time for the big one.

979
01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.319
You up for this one, Maverick?

980
01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.738
Just a walk in the park, Kazansky.

981
01:05:11.742 --> 01:05:14.536
Contact. Multiple bogies, 165.

982
01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:16.914
Two miles.
Looks like they're going away from us.

983
01:05:16.997 --> 01:05:19.750
Ho, I see them, tallyho, right 2 o'clock.
I'm in.

984
01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:21.085
I'm in.

985
01:05:41.105 --> 01:05:43.107
That son of a bitch cut me off.

986
01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.700
Come on, come on. Jesus Christ.

987
01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:55.369
Ice, take the shot.

988
01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:57.454
Come on, Ice, get the hell out of there.

989
01:05:57.538 --> 01:05:59.390
I can't get the angle.
I'm too close for missiles.

990
01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:00.791
I'm switching to guns.

991
01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.710
Ice, fire or clear.

992
01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:13.303
Look at this! Jesus Christ,
I can take a shot right here!

993
01:06:13.387 --> 01:06:15.639
I need another 20 seconds,
then I've got it.

994
01:06:21.145 --> 01:06:22.813
I'm moving in. I've got the shot.

995
01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:25.315
Come on, Mav, let's get in there!
Come on, Mav!

996
01:06:26.942 --> 01:06:29.223
Maverick's getting impatient, Ice.
Come on, take the shot.

997
01:06:29.278 --> 01:06:30.821
Ten more seconds, then I've got him.

998
01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:35.826
Come on, Ice, get the hell out of there!
Let's do it, Mav.

999
01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:37.578
Ice, come off high right. I'm in.

1000
01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:40.497
- Five more seconds.
- Come off high right, Ice. I'm in.

1001
01:06:40.831 --> 01:06:42.166
I'm Off. Shit!

1002
01:06:45.586 --> 01:06:46.837
We're in his jet wash!

1003
01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.463
Ho! Holy shit!

1004
01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:54.178
This is not good.
Shit, we got a flameout, Mav.

1005
01:06:54.303 --> 01:06:55.929
Engine one is out.

1006
01:06:56.013 --> 01:06:57.347
Engine two is out!

1007
01:06:57.431 --> 01:06:59.075
Goose, I'm losing control.
I'm losing control.

1008
01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:02.186
I can't control it. It won't recover. Shit.

1009
01:07:04.813 --> 01:07:06.607
It's coupling up, Mav!
We're out of control.

1010
01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.692
This is not good! This is not good!

1011
01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:10.360
Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.

1012
01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:12.613
He's in a flat spin.
He's heading out to sea.

1013
01:07:15.824 --> 01:07:18.702
Altitude 8,000, 7,000.

1014
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:22.873
Six. We're at six, Mav.

1015
01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:27.502
I'm pinned forward, Goose.
I can't reach the ejection handle.

1016
01:07:29.838 --> 01:07:31.882
Goose, you're gonna
have to punch us out.

1017
01:07:32.007 --> 01:07:33.634
I can't reach the ejection handle.

1018
01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:35.719
- Eject.
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

1019
01:07:35.844 --> 01:07:37.346
Eject! Eject! Eject!

1020
01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:39.181
Watch the canopy!

1021
01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.076
Goose! Goose! Oh, no!

1022
01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.245
Oh!

1023
01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:05.165
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God.

1024
01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.251
Oh...

1025
01:08:19.846 --> 01:08:21.056
Oh, God.

1026
01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:54.548
Sir, let go of him.

1027
01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:56.717
You gotta let him go, sir.

1028
01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:41.136
How you doing?

1029
01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:42.971
I'm all right.

1030
01:09:45.807 --> 01:09:48.310
- Goose is dead.
- I know.

1031
01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:56.026
You fly jets long enough,
something like this happens.

1032
01:09:57.778 --> 01:10:00.989
He was my RIO, my responsibility.

1033
01:10:03.992 --> 01:10:07.037
In my squadron in Vietnam,
we lost eight of 18 aircraft.

1034
01:10:07.162 --> 01:10:08.663
Ten men.

1035
01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:11.875
First one dies, you die too.

1036
01:10:13.335 --> 01:10:14.836
But there will be others.

1037
01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:18.465
You can count on it.

1038
01:10:20.384 --> 01:10:22.010
You gotta let him go.

1039
01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:27.391
You gotta let him go.

1040
01:10:45.325 --> 01:10:47.202
I think maybe it was my fault.

1041
01:10:49.413 --> 01:10:51.248
Nah.

1042
01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:55.168
I don't know what the hell went wrong.

1043
01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:59.756
I'd like to help.

1044
01:11:01.091 --> 01:11:02.926
I know it's difficult.

1045
01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:09.933
God, I want him back.

1046
01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:19.192
I'll be here if you need me, okay?

1047
01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:14.975
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.

1048
01:13:33.243 --> 01:13:35.203
But he'd have flown anyway

1049
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:37.330
without you.

1050
01:13:39.374 --> 01:13:42.252
He'd have hated it,
but he would've done it.

1051
01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:08.778
We find that the F-14 flat spin
was induced by the disruption of airflow

1052
01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:10.363
into the starboard engine.

1053
01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:14.284
This disruption stalled the engine,

1054
01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:17.704
which produced enough yaw rate

1055
01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:22.125
to induce a spin
which was unrecoverable.

1056
01:14:22.584 --> 01:14:26.296
There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell
could either see or avoid the jet wash

1057
01:14:26.421 --> 01:14:28.131
which produced the engine stall.

1058
01:14:28.715 --> 01:14:30.300
Therefore, the board of inquiry finds

1059
01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.218
that Lieutenant Pete Mitchell
was not at fault

1060
01:14:32.302 --> 01:14:34.054
in the accident of 29 July.

1061
01:14:34.429 --> 01:14:36.869
Lieutenant Mitchell's record
will be cleared of this incident.

1062
01:14:37.432 --> 01:14:40.393
Lieutenant Mitchell is restored
to flight status without further delay.

1063
01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:43.647
These proceedings are closed.

1064
01:14:52.906 --> 01:14:54.908
Get him up flying, soon.

1065
01:15:21.935 --> 01:15:24.187
Come on, kid, come on.
Get in there. Engage.

1066
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.439
All right, you got a bogey
at 2 o'clock low, Maverick.

1067
01:15:26.523 --> 01:15:28.525
<i>You got the angle. Piece of cake, pal.</i>

1068
01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:34.447
Take the shot, kid. Take the shot.

1069
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:37.992
You can engage any time, Maverick.

1070
01:15:49.129 --> 01:15:51.381
- Hey, where the hell are you going?
- It's not good.

1071
01:15:51.506 --> 01:15:53.049
It... It doesn't look good.

1072
01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:54.527
What do you mean,
it doesn't look good?

1073
01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:56.271
It doesn't get to look
any better than that.

1074
01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:10.900
Hey, man, we could've had him.

1075
01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:13.319
Hey, we could've had him, man!

1076
01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:17.657
I will fire
when I am goddamn good and ready!

1077
01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:19.826
You got that?

1078
01:16:38.428 --> 01:16:40.722
He can't get back in the saddle.
Won't engage.

1079
01:16:41.723 --> 01:16:43.224
It's only been a few days.

1080
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.227
You know, he just might
not make it back.

1081
01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:51.441
Keep sending him up.

1082
01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:12.420
Mitchell.

1083
01:17:13.797 --> 01:17:15.882
I'm sorry about Goose.

1084
01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:21.429
Everybody liked him.

1085
01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:28.603
I'm sorry.

1086
01:17:48.456 --> 01:17:50.124
Hi, it's Wolfman.

1087
01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:55.171
Yeah, Maverick just quit.

1088
01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:18.820
Excuse me.

1089
01:18:22.949 --> 01:18:23.992
May n?

1090
01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:25.994
Please.

1091
01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:35.295
'H...

1092
01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:37.422
I'll have what he's having.

1093
01:18:37.589 --> 01:18:38.882
Hemlock, is it?

1094
01:18:39.799 --> 01:18:41.301
Ice water.

1095
01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:48.474
You weren't gonna say goodbye?

1096
01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:53.187
I heard you got that job in Washington.

1097
01:18:54.105 --> 01:18:56.691
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1098
01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:02.196
But I wasn't gonna leave
without saying goodbye.

1099
01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.948
Well...

1100
01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.077
It's good to see you.

1101
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:10.121
Thanks.

1102
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:13.917
Where you going?

1103
01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:17.754
You don't even have a ticket, do you?

1104
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:22.175
Listen, I've seen all the evidence,
and it's not your responsibility.

1105
01:19:23.593 --> 01:19:25.178
It's not your fault.

1106
01:19:27.055 --> 01:19:29.557
You're one of the best pilots
in the Navy.

1107
01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:34.062
What you do up there, it's dangerous.

1108
01:19:35.647 --> 01:19:37.607
But you've got to go on.

1109
01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:40.693
No, you don't understand.

1110
01:19:41.736 --> 01:19:43.237
When I first met you,

1111
01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:46.741
you were larger than life.

1112
01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:50.411
Look at you.

1113
01:19:52.497 --> 01:19:55.375
You're not gonna be happy
unless you're going Mach 2

1114
01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:57.460
with your hair on fire, you know that.

1115
01:19:57.543 --> 01:19:59.170
No, it's over.

1116
01:19:59.754 --> 01:20:02.465
- It's just over.
- To be the best of the best

1117
01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:05.426
means you make mistakes
and then you go on.

1118
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:06.886
It's just like the rest of us.

1119
01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:08.972
Oh, you don't think I know that?

1120
01:20:11.432 --> 01:20:13.476
I'm here to help.

1121
01:20:14.686 --> 01:20:16.854
Look, thank you.

1122
01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:22.276
But if I wanted help, really,
I would have asked for it.

1123
01:20:28.658 --> 01:20:30.284
So I'm too late.

1124
01:20:32.412 --> 01:20:34.205
You've already left.

1125
01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:39.002
You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?

1126
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:41.254
Except to quit.

1127
01:20:44.632 --> 01:20:47.343
You've got that maneuver down
real well.

1128
01:20:55.393 --> 01:20:57.311
So long, Pete Mitchell.

1129
01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:25.548
Well, hi, Maverick, come on in.

1130
01:21:26.174 --> 01:21:27.425
- How are you doing?
- Good.

1131
01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:28.736
Really? You sure?
You sure you're feeling

1132
01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.362
- okay with everything?
- Oh, I feel great.

1133
01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:32.430
Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink

1134
01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:34.515
- or anything else like that?
- No, thank you.

1135
01:21:34.599 --> 01:21:35.701
Okay, well, why don't you just...

1136
01:21:35.725 --> 01:21:37.161
- Thank you very much.
- ...make yourself comfortable

1137
01:21:37.185 --> 01:21:39.545
- because Mike will be right down, okay?
- Great, thank you.

1138
01:21:59.165 --> 01:22:00.875
I flew with your old man.

1139
01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:03.669
<i>VF-51, the Oriskany.</i>

1140
01:22:06.464 --> 01:22:08.508
You're a lot like he was.

1141
01:22:08.925 --> 01:22:10.468
Only better

1142
01:22:11.803 --> 01:22:13.387
and worse.

1143
01:22:14.889 --> 01:22:17.767
He was a natural heroic
son of a bitch, that one.

1144
01:22:22.396 --> 01:22:23.981
So he did do it right.

1145
01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:30.530
Yeah, he did it right.

1146
01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:43.167
Is that why you fly the way you do?

1147
01:22:43.251 --> 01:22:45.294
Trying to prove something?

1148
01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:49.715
Yeah, your old man did it right.

1149
01:22:51.134 --> 01:22:53.594
What I'm about to tell you is classified.

1150
01:22:53.678 --> 01:22:55.263
It could end my career.

1151
01:22:55.429 --> 01:22:58.141
We were in the worst dogfight
I ever dreamed of.

1152
01:22:59.809 --> 01:23:02.353
Bogies like fireflies all over the sky.

1153
01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.483
His F-4 was hit, he was wounded,
but he could've made it back.

1154
01:23:07.567 --> 01:23:10.736
He stayed in it,
saved three planes before he bought it.

1155
01:23:13.948 --> 01:23:15.342
How come I never heard that before?

1156
01:23:15.366 --> 01:23:17.845
Now, that's not something
the State Department tells dependents

1157
01:23:17.869 --> 01:23:20.538
when the battle occurred
over the wrong line

1158
01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:21.789
on some map.

1159
01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:24.625
So you were there?

1160
01:23:25.251 --> 01:23:26.711
I was there.

1161
01:23:27.712 --> 01:23:29.505
What's on your mind?

1162
01:23:30.798 --> 01:23:32.466
My options, sir.

1163
01:23:33.843 --> 01:23:34.886
Simple.

1164
01:23:36.387 --> 01:23:38.848
First, you've acquired enough
points to show up tomorrow

1165
01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:41.142
and graduate with your Top Gun class.

1166
01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:43.477
Or you can quit.

1167
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:46.689
There'd be no disgrace.

1168
01:23:46.814 --> 01:23:48.983
That spin was hell.
It would've shook me up.

1169
01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:50.902
So you think I should quit?

1170
01:23:51.277 --> 01:23:52.820
I didn't say that.

1171
01:23:54.655 --> 01:23:57.742
The simple fact is,
you feel responsible for Goose,

1172
01:23:57.825 --> 01:24:00.119
and you have a confidence problem.

1173
01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:04.332
Now, I'm not gonna sit here and blow
sunshine up your ass, lieutenant.

1174
01:24:04.749 --> 01:24:08.377
A good pilot is compelled to
always evaluate what's happened.

1175
01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:11.672
So he can apply what he's learnt.

1176
01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.634
Up there, we gotta push it.

1177
01:24:16.135 --> 01:24:17.470
That's our job.

1178
01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:23.643
It's your option, lieutenant, all yours.

1179
01:24:35.947 --> 01:24:37.949
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir,

1180
01:24:38.032 --> 01:24:39.992
but thank you very much for your time.

1181
01:24:40.076 --> 01:24:42.370
No problem. Good luck.

1182
01:25:31.794 --> 01:25:32.962
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

1183
01:25:33.212 --> 01:25:34.648
- Where's Maverick?
- ...here at Top Gun,

1184
01:25:34.672 --> 01:25:36.441
<i>we challenged you
to fly against the very best.</i>

1185
01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:37.633
I don't know where he is.

1186
01:25:37.717 --> 01:25:39.343
<i>Now, we ask you to take
that expertise...</i>

1187
01:25:39.427 --> 01:25:41.053
You know what he's planning to do?

1188
01:25:41.137 --> 01:25:43.222
<i>...and keep the tradition alive.</i>

1189
01:25:43.389 --> 01:25:44.825
Gotta be hard on the guy,
though, you know?

1190
01:25:44.849 --> 01:25:46.225
<i>Good luck.</i>

1191
01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:19.925
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1192
01:26:21.761 --> 01:26:23.763
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mav.

1193
01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:25.389
Sir.

1194
01:26:28.142 --> 01:26:29.185
Gentlemen.

1195
01:26:30.019 --> 01:26:32.938
I hate to break up the party
before it really gets out of hand,

1196
01:26:33.022 --> 01:26:34.357
but there is work to be done.

1197
01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:37.109
Some of you have to
depart immediately.

1198
01:26:37.193 --> 01:26:38.903
We have a crisis situation.

1199
01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:40.821
Ice, Slider.

1200
01:26:40.905 --> 01:26:42.114
Yo.

1201
01:26:42.198 --> 01:26:44.033
- Hollywood, Wolfman.
- Yes, sir.

1202
01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:47.244
Maverick.

1203
01:26:47.328 --> 01:26:48.704
Sir.

1204
01:26:52.458 --> 01:26:54.960
Maverick, you'll get your RIO
when you get to the ship.

1205
01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:57.004
And if you don't,

1206
01:26:58.005 --> 01:26:59.298
give me a call.

1207
01:26:59.382 --> 01:27:00.758
I'll fly with you.

1208
01:27:03.469 --> 01:27:04.595
Sir.

1209
01:27:13.896 --> 01:27:15.096
<i>Gentlemen, this is bull's-eye.</i>

1210
01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:19.527
The communication ship
SS Layton has become disabled

1211
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:21.946
and has wandered into foreign territory.

1212
01:27:22.029 --> 01:27:24.365
A rescue operation is to begin
within the hour.

1213
01:27:24.448 --> 01:27:27.535
Your mission is to give
air support to that rescue.

1214
01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:30.704
There are MiGs in the area,
and tensions are high.

1215
01:27:30.788 --> 01:27:34.625
If you witness a hostile act,
you will return fire.

1216
01:27:35.793 --> 01:27:38.170
Those MiGs carry
the Exocet anti-ship missile.

1217
01:27:38.254 --> 01:27:40.923
They can fire that missile
from 100 miles away.

1218
01:27:41.298 --> 01:27:43.050
Gentlemen, this is the real thing.

1219
01:27:43.217 --> 01:27:45.428
This is what you've been trained for.

1220
01:27:45.553 --> 01:27:49.390
You are America's best. Make us proud.

1221
01:27:49.473 --> 01:27:51.058
- Ice.
- Yes, sir.

1222
01:27:51.142 --> 01:27:52.226
- Hollywood.
- Yes, sir.

1223
01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:53.394
Sector two.

1224
01:27:53.477 --> 01:27:55.896
And Maverick, you back them up
with Merlin on Ready Five.

1225
01:27:57.523 --> 01:27:59.233
Yes, sir.

1226
01:28:00.359 --> 01:28:01.402
Rise!

1227
01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:04.238
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

1228
01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:07.575
This is not personal,
but with regard to Maverick,

1229
01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.493
is he the best backup that...

1230
01:28:09.577 --> 01:28:11.954
I know what's on your mind,
Kazansky, just get on it.

1231
01:29:28.822 --> 01:29:31.051
<i>Mustang, when you get the chance,
can you give me a mode-four check?</i>

1232
01:29:31.075 --> 01:29:34.495
Voodoo one, you've got a pair
of bogies, 12 o'clock, 15 miles.

1233
01:29:34.578 --> 01:29:38.874
Voodoo one, Voodoo one,
090 radar contact 15 miles.

1234
01:29:38.958 --> 01:29:40.626
They're doing 500 knots.

1235
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:42.002
Roger, that's your bogey.

1236
01:29:45.214 --> 01:29:48.342
<i>Got them dead ahead, 15 miles,
air speed is 600 knots.</i>

1237
01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:53.722
<i>Bogies' air speed, 650.
We're a little close together.</i>

1238
01:29:53.806 --> 01:29:55.182
<i>Let's take a wider split.</i>

1239
01:29:57.017 --> 01:29:59.520
<i>They're at 15,000 feet now,
dead ahead, ten miles.</i>

1240
01:29:59.812 --> 01:30:01.146
<i>Air speed is still increasing.</i>

1241
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:04.191
<i>Eight hundred knots.
Dead ahead, now, 8 miles.</i>

1242
01:30:04.358 --> 01:30:07.027
<i>- Dead ahead, now, 8 miles.
- Wood, you got them?</i>

1243
01:30:07.111 --> 01:30:08.362
Not yet, I can't see them.

1244
01:30:08.445 --> 01:30:10.239
They must be close,
I'm getting a hard-on.

1245
01:30:17.413 --> 01:30:19.707
Okay, Wood, I'm taking the lead.
Let's identify them.

1246
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:21.500
<i>Roger, Ice, you got the lead.</i>

1247
01:30:21.584 --> 01:30:23.544
<i>I'm on your left side, a little low.</i>

1248
01:30:25.379 --> 01:30:27.923
- Maverick's up and ready in Alert Five.
- Good, good.

1249
01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:32.052
<i>Hollywood, my bogey's still locked up.</i>

1250
01:30:32.553 --> 01:30:34.054
<i>He's drifting to the left.</i>

1251
01:30:35.222 --> 01:30:37.349
<i>Still maneuvering, course 090.</i>

1252
01:30:39.059 --> 01:30:42.139
<i>Okay, Wood, let's bring it to the right,
and we'll get a better angle on them.</i>

1253
01:30:51.405 --> 01:30:52.906
Ice, we got a problem here.

1254
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:54.467
Now I'm breaking out
four aircraft on the radar.

1255
01:30:54.491 --> 01:30:56.994
Not one pair, two pair.
Repeat, four bogies.

1256
01:30:57.077 --> 01:30:58.495
Wood, we've got four bogies.

1257
01:31:01.665 --> 01:31:02.833
Wrong! Make that five!

1258
01:31:02.916 --> 01:31:03.959
There's five, sir.

1259
01:31:04.043 --> 01:31:05.961
- That's five?
- Yes, sir.

1260
01:31:07.755 --> 01:31:09.089
Oh, shit!

1261
01:31:09.715 --> 01:31:11.300
He's got a radar lock on us!

1262
01:31:13.427 --> 01:31:16.347
Get out of there, Hollywood!
Get out of there, goddamn it!

1263
01:31:23.562 --> 01:31:24.688
Break left!

1264
01:31:24.897 --> 01:31:27.149
I'm hit! I'm hit! We're coming apart!

1265
01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:28.942
I can't control it! Hold on!

1266
01:31:29.026 --> 01:31:30.653
<i>Zero for twenty! We're going down!</i>

1267
01:31:30.736 --> 01:31:32.005
Wood's been hit! Wood's been hit!

1268
01:31:32.029 --> 01:31:33.489
Shit! Wood's been hit!

1269
01:31:33.572 --> 01:31:35.699
<i>Voodoo one! Wood's been hit!
Wood's been hit!</i>

1270
01:31:35.783 --> 01:31:37.993
<i>We've lost Hollywood!
Repeat, we've lost Hollywood!</i>

1271
01:31:38.077 --> 01:31:40.663
- We've <i>lost</i> our wingman.
- Launch Maverick on Alert Five.

1272
01:31:40.788 --> 01:31:42.706
<i>Get a bearing on
Hollywood and Wolfman</i>

1273
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:45.125
<i>and launch the rescue
helicopter immediately.</i>

1274
01:32:11.902 --> 01:32:14.022
- Maverick's airborne.
- Iceman, what's your position?

1275
01:32:14.154 --> 01:32:16.448
<i>090 at 180 miles.</i>

1276
01:32:16.532 --> 01:32:18.325
Yeah, we're coming in left!

1277
01:32:18.659 --> 01:32:20.828
Three MiGs, dead ahead,
coming down the left side.

1278
01:32:23.038 --> 01:32:25.374
I'm going after them.
I'm bringing it around to the left.

1279
01:32:28.252 --> 01:32:30.879
We got four on our tail!
That makes six of them!

1280
01:32:30.963 --> 01:32:33.173
Who do you think is hooking
in the guns range?

1281
01:32:37.678 --> 01:32:39.304
He's firing! Break right!

1282
01:32:41.306 --> 01:32:43.243
Mustang, this is Voodoo one,
we are totally defensive.

1283
01:32:43.267 --> 01:32:44.351
<i>Launch the alert fighters.</i>

1284
01:32:44.435 --> 01:32:45.477
Where? Where are they?

1285
01:32:45.561 --> 01:32:47.604
A hundred and sixty miles
and closing in fast, sir.

1286
01:32:47.688 --> 01:32:50.023
Ready Willard and Simkin
off CATs three and four.

1287
01:32:52.818 --> 01:32:55.070
Maverick's supersonic.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.

1288
01:32:55.154 --> 01:32:56.965
Move your ass! Get up here!
I'm engaged with five.

1289
01:32:56.989 --> 01:32:58.699
Repeat, five. I'm in deep shit!

1290
01:33:01.326 --> 01:33:02.578
What about Willard and Simkin?

1291
01:33:03.370 --> 01:33:05.930
Both catapults are broken.
We can't launch any aircraft yet, sir.

1292
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:07.875
- How long?
- It'll take ten minutes.

1293
01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:10.353
Bullshit, ten minutes.
This thing will be over in two minutes.

1294
01:33:10.377 --> 01:33:11.879
Get on it!

1295
01:33:13.505 --> 01:33:15.883
One MiG, 12 o'clock high!
One MiG, 12 o'clock high!

1296
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:18.552
Watch your back! Watch your back!

1297
01:33:23.432 --> 01:33:24.600
Break right!

1298
01:33:26.894 --> 01:33:28.312
Shit, that was close!

1299
01:33:28.437 --> 01:33:29.622
<i>Maverick, how about
some help down here?</i>

1300
01:33:29.646 --> 01:33:31.899
<i>- Where the hell are you?
- Come on, kid,</i> hang <i>in there.</i>

1301
01:33:34.401 --> 01:33:35.903
Jesus Christ.

1302
01:33:37.946 --> 01:33:40.199
Maverick, how about some help?
Engage, goddamn it!

1303
01:33:42.326 --> 01:33:44.661
Maverick, we got a MiG on our tail.

1304
01:33:47.164 --> 01:33:48.707
Watch out! Watch out!

1305
01:33:51.126 --> 01:33:53.504
Shit, we just flew
right through his jet wash.

1306
01:33:55.714 --> 01:33:57.633
Get control, Mav! Get control!

1307
01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:06.642
Good recovery, Mav.

1308
01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:08.644
Okay, let's get in there.

1309
01:34:08.811 --> 01:34:10.562
Come on, we gotta help Ice.

1310
01:34:10.729 --> 01:34:12.731
Come on, let's get back
in the game, Maverick!

1311
01:34:12.815 --> 01:34:14.918
- Come on! Get in there, Maverick!
- No. It's no good.

1312
01:34:14.942 --> 01:34:16.443
It's no good.

1313
01:34:18.612 --> 01:34:20.614
God damn it! Maverick's disengaging!

1314
01:34:20.697 --> 01:34:22.157
I knew it! Shit!

1315
01:34:22.241 --> 01:34:23.700
God damn it, Maverick!

1316
01:34:26.912 --> 01:34:28.632
<i>Get in there, Maverick!
You can't leave him!</i>

1317
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:30.975
<i>Come on! Maverick!
What the hell are you doing?</i>

1318
01:34:30.999 --> 01:34:32.042
Talk to me, Goose.

1319
01:34:32.125 --> 01:34:33.228
<i>Maverick, get in there, for Christ's sake!</i>

1320
01:34:33.252 --> 01:34:35.254
<i>- Ice is in trouble!</i>
- Talk to <i>me, Goose.</i>

1321
01:34:35.337 --> 01:34:37.482
<i>Get in there, Maverick!
He won't last down there alone!</i>

1322
01:34:37.506 --> 01:34:38.966
<i>Get in the fight, for Christ's sake!</i>

1323
01:34:39.049 --> 01:34:41.510
<i>Maverick! Maverick!</i>

1324
01:34:44.346 --> 01:34:45.931
Maverick's reengaging, sir.

1325
01:34:51.728 --> 01:34:54.690
- I can't get him off my tail!
- Ice, I've got your MiG dead ahead.

1326
01:34:54.773 --> 01:34:56.191
<i>I've got him dead ahead.</i>

1327
01:34:57.776 --> 01:34:59.403
Good tone. I've got good tone.

1328
01:35:00.112 --> 01:35:01.989
I've got tone! I've got tone! Firing!

1329
01:35:13.083 --> 01:35:15.502
- Where? Where are they?
- A hundred and fifty-five miles.

1330
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:18.005
Two MiGs, dead ahead.
Closing at 800 miles an hour.

1331
01:35:18.088 --> 01:35:20.568
I see them. I see them.
I'm gonna take them down the left side.

1332
01:35:22.801 --> 01:35:24.052
Oh, my God.

1333
01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:29.391
Ice is right below us.
He's got a MiG on his tail.

1334
01:35:31.768 --> 01:35:33.854
He's firing! Break left! Break left!

1335
01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:39.318
He overshot! He overshot!

1336
01:35:39.985 --> 01:35:41.695
Coming in, Ice. I'm coming in.

1337
01:35:44.364 --> 01:35:45.866
I got two MiGs dead ahead.

1338
01:35:46.992 --> 01:35:49.202
I got him, Mav.
One MiG passing between us.

1339
01:35:53.665 --> 01:35:55.876
You got a MiG on your left. On your left!
3 o'clock!

1340
01:35:55.959 --> 01:35:57.628
<i>He's gonna fire, he's gonna fire!</i>

1341
01:36:04.801 --> 01:36:06.154
Maverick, check the guys to the north!

1342
01:36:06.178 --> 01:36:07.721
Check the guys to the north!

1343
01:36:10.432 --> 01:36:12.392
Banking left. Banking left.

1344
01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:17.064
There he is. Get him, Ice. Get him!

1345
01:36:17.230 --> 01:36:18.732
Okay, you guys, I'm coming in!

1346
01:36:23.737 --> 01:36:25.465
Maverick, we got a MiG
coming around on our tail!

1347
01:36:25.489 --> 01:36:28.075
- We gotta get out of here!
- I can't leave Ice.

1348
01:36:28.158 --> 01:36:30.577
He's still coming around!
He's gonna get behind us!

1349
01:36:31.036 --> 01:36:32.829
I'm not leaving my wingman.

1350
01:36:35.832 --> 01:36:38.043
I'm on his tail. I'm on his tail.
I'm going for it.

1351
01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:40.104
I'm going for it.
I'm going for the shot right now.

1352
01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:41.755
Roger. Engaged.

1353
01:36:43.924 --> 01:36:45.342
I've got radar lock.

1354
01:36:46.009 --> 01:36:47.803
Good tone. I'm taking a shot.

1355
01:36:47.928 --> 01:36:49.096
Fire!

1356
01:36:52.975 --> 01:36:55.268
Bingo! Wash that sucker, yeah!

1357
01:36:55.352 --> 01:36:57.038
Ice, watch out.
There's a MiG to your right.

1358
01:36:57.062 --> 01:36:58.230
He's firing!

1359
01:37:00.107 --> 01:37:01.441
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1360
01:37:03.610 --> 01:37:05.213
We're hit! We're hit in the right engine!

1361
01:37:05.237 --> 01:37:06.947
I'm shutting it down!
I'm shutting it down!

1362
01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:13.203
Coming in, Ice. Coming in.

1363
01:37:16.665 --> 01:37:19.459
Ice, that bogey's still behind you.
I'm maneuvering for a shot.

1364
01:37:19.710 --> 01:37:21.461
Stay with him, Mav, stay with him!

1365
01:37:21.545 --> 01:37:22.905
Take the shot! Nail him! Nail him!

1366
01:37:22.963 --> 01:37:24.798
Shit. Ice, I can't get a tone.

1367
01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:26.967
Shoot, Maverick!
I can't get him off my tail!

1368
01:37:31.555 --> 01:37:32.865
Maverick, we're hit! We're hit again!

1369
01:37:32.889 --> 01:37:35.100
It's okay. Both engines are functioning.
We're okay.

1370
01:37:35.183 --> 01:37:37.644
Ice, on the count of three,
break hard right.

1371
01:37:38.603 --> 01:37:39.646
Three,

1372
01:37:39.730 --> 01:37:40.814
two,

1373
01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:42.774
one. Break right!

1374
01:37:45.777 --> 01:37:46.862
Firing!

1375
01:37:50.532 --> 01:37:51.783
Damn it, I missed!

1376
01:37:51.867 --> 01:37:54.619
Don't let him go. Keep on him, Mav.
Keep on him.

1377
01:37:54.703 --> 01:37:56.288
I got him. I got him.

1378
01:37:57.831 --> 01:37:59.416
Here comes a shot.

1379
01:38:04.671 --> 01:38:05.964
Scratch three!

1380
01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:09.569
Maverick, move!
There's a MiG on your tail!

1381
01:38:09.593 --> 01:38:10.802
There's a MiG on your tail!

1382
01:38:10.886 --> 01:38:12.822
We've got a problem here.
We've only got one missile left.

1383
01:38:12.846 --> 01:38:14.556
Approaching 110 miles, sir.

1384
01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:15.849
God damn it.

1385
01:38:15.932 --> 01:38:17.243
I got him! I got him! He's right on us!

1386
01:38:17.267 --> 01:38:18.643
He's between our tails!

1387
01:38:21.563 --> 01:38:22.981
Shit.

1388
01:38:26.276 --> 01:38:27.916
You haven't lost him. He's still with us!

1389
01:38:32.032 --> 01:38:33.551
What are you doing?
You're slowing down!

1390
01:38:33.575 --> 01:38:34.701
You're slowing down!

1391
01:38:34.785 --> 01:38:36.185
I'm bringing him in closer, Merlin.

1392
01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:37.537
You're gonna do what?

1393
01:38:42.501 --> 01:38:44.086
This is it, Maverick!

1394
01:38:44.169 --> 01:38:45.929
I'm gonna hit the brakes,
he'll fly right by.

1395
01:38:45.962 --> 01:38:47.547
Shit! He's gonna get a lock on us!

1396
01:38:50.926 --> 01:38:52.302
Now!

1397
01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:59.392
I got a good lock. Firing.

1398
01:39:04.314 --> 01:39:05.565
Scratch four!

1399
01:39:09.736 --> 01:39:11.571
Mustang, this is Voodoo three.

1400
01:39:11.655 --> 01:39:13.365
<i>Remaining MiGs are bugging out.</i>

1401
01:39:28.338 --> 01:39:31.299
Mustang, this is Maverick
requesting flyby.

1402
01:39:32.342 --> 01:39:34.094
Negative, Ghost Rider.
The pattern is full.

1403
01:39:37.264 --> 01:39:38.974
Excuse me.
Something I should know about?

1404
01:39:51.611 --> 01:39:52.821
Thank you.

1405
01:39:58.243 --> 01:39:59.911
God damn that guy.

1406
01:40:23.935 --> 01:40:25.312
Yes!

1407
01:40:53.006 --> 01:40:55.383
What the hell happened
to you guys? Hollywood!

1408
01:40:55.926 --> 01:40:56.968
You!

1409
01:41:00.764 --> 01:41:02.349
You are still dangerous.

1410
01:41:06.686 --> 01:41:08.897
You can be my wingman anytime.

1411
01:41:10.148 --> 01:41:11.274
Bullshit.

1412
01:41:11.358 --> 01:41:12.734
You can be mine.

1413
01:42:04.828 --> 01:42:06.496
- Maverick.
- Sir.

1414
01:42:06.705 --> 01:42:08.266
How does it feel to be on the front page

1415
01:42:08.290 --> 01:42:10.210
of every newspaper
in the English-speaking world?

1416
01:42:10.875 --> 01:42:12.715
Even though the other side
denies the incident.

1417
01:42:12.752 --> 01:42:14.421
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

1418
01:42:14.713 --> 01:42:16.148
They gave you your choice of duty, son.

1419
01:42:16.172 --> 01:42:18.008
Anything, anywhere.
Do you believe that shit?

1420
01:42:18.675 --> 01:42:21.219
Where do you think you wanna go?

1421
01:42:21.594 --> 01:42:23.972
I thought of being an instructor, sir.
