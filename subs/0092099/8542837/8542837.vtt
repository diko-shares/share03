00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:11.509
- Morning, Wells.
- Morning, sir.

3
00:04:11.592 --> 00:04:12.927
Hi.

4
00:04:16.097 --> 00:04:17.640
Ghost Rider, this is Strike.

5
00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:19.392
We have unknown aircraft.

6
00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:20.852
Inbound, Mustang.

7
00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:23.271
Your vector, 090 for bogey.

8
00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:34.699
Who's up there?

9
00:04:34.782 --> 00:04:37.160
Cougar and Merlin
and Maverick and Goose.

10
00:04:37.618 --> 00:04:38.619
Great.

11
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.663
Maverick and Goose.

12
00:04:49.964 --> 00:04:51.215
Talk to me, Goose.

13
00:04:51.632 --> 00:04:54.218
Roger, I got him.
Contact, 20 left at 30 miles.

14
00:04:54.302 --> 00:04:55.511
Nine-hundred knots closure.

15
00:04:56.304 --> 00:04:59.057
- Cougar, you hear that?
- Roger.

16
00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:02.310
- Merlin, you got him?
- Roger, I've got radar contact.

17
00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:04.812
I'll get a visual ID.
Cougar, you hook him.

18
00:05:04.896 --> 00:05:06.773
Roger, and I'll clean him and fry him.

19
00:05:14.197 --> 00:05:17.909
Mustang.
Mustang, this is Ghost Rider, 203.

20
00:05:18.076 --> 00:05:21.370
I've got him inbound,
bogey heading 270.

21
00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:24.165
We're at ten miles, 900 knots closure.

22
00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:27.418
Ghost Rider, take Angels ten left, 30.

23
00:05:27.543 --> 00:05:29.003
Are we supposed to have visitors today?

24
00:05:29.087 --> 00:05:30.379
Negative, sir.

25
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.098
- Merlin, see if he's a single.
- Roger.

26
00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:45.394
- Goose, you see a trailer?
- Negative, Merlin.

27
00:05:46.437 --> 00:05:47.897
Looks like he's a single.

28
00:05:48.272 --> 00:05:49.899
Cougar, I'm gonna go
head-to-head with him.

29
00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:52.401
Take it easy, Maverick.
I don't like this shit.

30
00:05:52.527 --> 00:05:55.321
I'm gonna break high and right,
see if he's really alone.

31
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.967
We've got 1,000 knots closure, Mav.

32
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.426
He's coming right at us.

33
00:06:17.635 --> 00:06:19.637
Okay, buddy, what's on your mind?

34
00:06:22.223 --> 00:06:23.558
Holy shit, there's two of them.

35
00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:26.936
MIG-28s.
No one's been this close before.

36
00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:29.647
What the hell are they doing here?
What's the position?

37
00:06:30.064 --> 00:06:31.315
Two hundred and fifty miles out, sir.

38
00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:33.526
Two hundred and fifty miles?
Get them out of here.

39
00:06:35.903 --> 00:06:38.281
Cougar, you've got MiG one.
I'm going after MiG two.

40
00:06:40.158 --> 00:06:41.742
I lost him in the sun.

41
00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:44.829
Shit. What's he doing?

42
00:06:45.288 --> 00:06:46.789
You got him, Merlin?

43
00:06:48.332 --> 00:06:50.960
He's coming around.
He's coming around on our tail.

44
00:06:51.794 --> 00:06:54.005
God damn it. This bogey's all over me.

45
00:06:57.884 --> 00:06:59.218
What's their range now?

46
00:06:59.302 --> 00:07:00.928
Two hundred miles, sir.

47
00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:02.388
If they break 150 miles,

48
00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:04.640
-launch the Alert Five aircraft.
- Yes, sir.

49
00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:08.436
Air speed, 300. Go get him, Mav.

50
00:07:08.936 --> 00:07:10.563
I'm going for missile lock.

51
00:07:11.314 --> 00:07:13.649
Let's see if we can scare
this guy out of here.

52
00:07:14.609 --> 00:07:15.860
Come on, lock up, baby.

53
00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:19.363
Lock up, baby. Lock up.

54
00:07:19.447 --> 00:07:21.657
I got him locked. Bingo.

55
00:07:26.787 --> 00:07:29.415
We got him, Mav.
He's bugging out and going home.

56
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.168
Mustang, this is Maverick.
MiG two is headed home.

57
00:07:33.794 --> 00:07:35.087
All right, what's their position?

58
00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:37.840
A hundred and eighty miles
at bearing 010, sir.

59
00:07:41.636 --> 00:07:44.055
Cougar, he's got missile lock on us.
Get away from this guy.

60
00:07:44.138 --> 00:07:46.057
What the hell is this shit?
He's engaging me.

61
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:50.519
God damn it, Mustang.
This is Ghost Rider,

62
00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:52.521
one,one,seven,
this bogey's all over me.

63
00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:54.649
He's got missile lock on me.
Do I have permission to fire?

64
00:07:54.732 --> 00:07:56.901
Do not fire until fired upon.

65
00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:00.947
Goose, there they are, right below us.

66
00:08:01.739 --> 00:08:04.408
The MiG's in perfect firing position.
He's right on Cougar's tail.

67
00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:07.995
No way, Goose. He'd have fired by now.
He's just trying to piss us off.

68
00:08:08.162 --> 00:08:10.665
Maverick, get down here
and get this asshole off me.

69
00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:14.335
Easy, Cougar.

70
00:08:15.253 --> 00:08:20.633
Bring it back, hard right.
Help me engage. I'm on my way.

71
00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:39.694
I can't shoot this son of a bitch.

72
00:08:39.777 --> 00:08:41.487
Let's see if we can have
a little fun with him.

73
00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:48.828
Is this your idea of fun, Mav?

74
00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:53.332
Greetings.

75
00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:58.045
Watch the birdie.

76
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.507
Jeez, I crack myself up.

77
00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:11.976
This is a great shot, Mav.
I should be a photographer.

78
00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:14.061
Cougar,

79
00:09:14.562 --> 00:09:16.230
your tail is clear. MiG one's bugged out.

80
00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:28.534
Cougar, this is Maverick.

81
00:09:29.327 --> 00:09:31.329
We've had enough fun
for one day, don't you think?

82
00:09:32.246 --> 00:09:33.414
I'm getting a little low on fuel,

83
00:09:33.497 --> 00:09:34.665
so we're heading home.

84
00:09:38.085 --> 00:09:39.378
We'll see you on deck.

85
00:09:48.763 --> 00:09:51.724
Cougar, we're running low on gas,
we gotta get out of here.

86
00:09:53.934 --> 00:09:55.436
Cougar.

87
00:09:57.772 --> 00:09:59.398
We're on vapour, Cougar.

88
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.317
Let's do it.

89
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.112
Cougar. Come on, Cougar.

90
00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:16.248
Let's take it back to the ship, man.

91
00:10:16.957 --> 00:10:18.292
Come on, Cougar.

92
00:10:18.626 --> 00:10:21.170
Get him on deck as soon as possible.
He's gotta be low on fuel.

93
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.425
Cougar, we gotta land this thing.
We are way low on gas.

94
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:27.927
You understand me?

95
00:10:28.969 --> 00:10:30.471
You all right, man?

96
00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:39.939
Maverick, you're at three-quarters
of a mile, call the ball.

97
00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:42.316
Roger. Maverick has the ball.

98
00:10:43.859 --> 00:10:47.196
- Cougar, it is time to land. Let's do it.
- Goose, Cougar's in trouble.

99
00:10:47.321 --> 00:10:49.323
Come on, Mav,
we're getting low on gas.

100
00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:50.866
Let's land this sucker.

101
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.869
Cougar!

102
00:11:00.709 --> 00:11:02.044
God damn it, Maverick.

103
00:11:02.169 --> 00:11:04.255
What're you doing, Mav?
We've got no fuel for this.

104
00:11:04.338 --> 00:11:05.840
We're going after Cougar.

105
00:11:07.174 --> 00:11:10.177
You tell him to land that plane.
That's an order.

106
00:11:10.678 --> 00:11:12.805
Ghost Rider, you are instructed to land.

107
00:11:12.888 --> 00:11:14.348
Land immediately.

108
00:11:19.353 --> 00:11:21.856
Any of you boys seen
an aircraft carrier around here?

109
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.942
Mav, we got a little problem up here.

110
00:11:25.025 --> 00:11:28.279
That MiG really screwed him up.
I don't think he can make it back.

111
00:11:31.532 --> 00:11:34.577
You're okay, Cougar.
Just stay on my wing,

112
00:11:34.869 --> 00:11:36.412
I'll take you all the way in.

113
00:11:36.704 --> 00:11:38.038
Just stay with me.

114
00:11:52.887 --> 00:11:55.723
Easy, Cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.

115
00:11:57.391 --> 00:12:00.269
You're a little low.
You're a little low, Coug.

116
00:12:01.729 --> 00:12:03.272
Come on, buddy, pull up.

117
00:12:05.065 --> 00:12:06.484
Pull up, Cougar.

118
00:12:07.818 --> 00:12:10.237
That's it. Almost there.

119
00:12:11.614 --> 00:12:15.659
Cougar, you're well below glide path,
three-quarters of a mile. Call the ball.

120
00:12:16.994 --> 00:12:18.454
Roger, ball.

121
00:12:28.672 --> 00:12:31.509
We're too low, Cougar.

122
00:12:31.842 --> 00:12:34.386
Increase power. Some more power!

123
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.514
Higher! Higher! Higher, damn it!

124
00:12:46.857 --> 00:12:48.108
Come in.

125
00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:51.946
Sir.

126
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.740
Cougar, you should be in sickbay.
What's on your mind?

127
00:12:55.449 --> 00:12:56.909
My wife and kid, sir.

128
00:12:57.785 --> 00:13:00.204
I almost orphaned him today,
and I've never even seen him.

129
00:13:03.207 --> 00:13:05.626
I don't know what happened
up there, but I was so scared.

130
00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:09.380
- Come on, we've seen this before.
- No, sir.

131
00:13:10.881 --> 00:13:12.383
I'm holding on too tight.

132
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.260
I've lost the edge.

133
00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:16.554
I'm sorry, sir.

134
00:13:18.472 --> 00:13:19.807
I'm sorry.

135
00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:27.648
Cougar.

136
00:13:30.401 --> 00:13:32.069
Thanks, Maverick.

137
00:13:34.655 --> 00:13:36.574
Maverick, Goose, come in here.

138
00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:39.743
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

139
00:13:40.911 --> 00:13:42.079
Shit.

140
00:13:46.417 --> 00:13:49.169
Maverick, you just did
an incredibly brave thing.

141
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.259
What you should have done
was land your plane.

142
00:13:55.342 --> 00:13:57.845
You don't own that plane,
the taxpayers do.

143
00:13:58.012 --> 00:14:01.140
Son, your ego is writing cheques
your body can't cash.

144
00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:02.683
You've been busted.

145
00:14:02.766 --> 00:14:06.020
You lost your qualifications
as section leader three times.

146
00:14:06.186 --> 00:14:08.439
Put in hack twice by me.

147
00:14:08.772 --> 00:14:10.774
With a history of high-speed passes

148
00:14:10.858 --> 00:14:13.193
over five air-control towers

149
00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:15.029
and one admiral's daughter.

150
00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:16.655
Penny Benjamin?

151
00:14:17.448 --> 00:14:18.657
And you, asshole.

152
00:14:19.283 --> 00:14:20.618
You're lucky to be here.

153
00:14:20.701 --> 00:14:22.036
Thank you, sir.

154
00:14:22.453 --> 00:14:23.454
And let's not bullshit, Maverick,

155
00:14:23.537 --> 00:14:25.998
your family name ain't
the best in the Navy.

156
00:14:26.206 --> 00:14:29.043
You need to be doing it better
and cleaner than the other guy.

157
00:14:29.126 --> 00:14:30.294
Now, what is it with you?

158
00:14:30.961 --> 00:14:34.048
Just wanna serve my country,
be the best fighter pilot in the Navy, sir!

159
00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:35.716
Don't screw around with me, Maverick.

160
00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:37.885
You're a hell of an instinctive pilot.

161
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.303
Maybe too good.

162
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.221
I'd like to bust your butt, but I can't.

163
00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:43.140
I got another problem here.

164
00:14:44.058 --> 00:14:46.894
I gotta send somebody
from this squadron to Miramar.

165
00:14:47.811 --> 00:14:48.812
I gotta do something here.

166
00:14:48.896 --> 00:14:50.856
I still can't believe it.

167
00:14:51.482 --> 00:14:52.983
I gotta give you your dream shot.

168
00:14:53.067 --> 00:14:54.985
I'm gonna send you up against the best.

169
00:14:55.319 --> 00:14:56.862
You two characters

170
00:14:57.571 --> 00:14:58.989
are going to Top Gun.

171
00:15:00.658 --> 00:15:04.036
For five weeks, you're gonna fly against
the best fighter pilots in the world.

172
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.580
You were number two,
Cougar was number one.

173
00:15:06.664 --> 00:15:08.499
Cougar lost it, turned in his wings.

174
00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:11.001
You guys are number one.

175
00:15:12.753 --> 00:15:14.254
But you remember one thing.

176
00:15:14.922 --> 00:15:16.757
You screw up just this much,

177
00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:21.095
you'll be flying a cargo plane
full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong.

178
00:15:21.345 --> 00:15:22.429
Yes, sir!

179
00:15:26.517 --> 00:15:27.685
That is all.

180
00:15:28.435 --> 00:15:30.771
You can tell me about
the MiG some other time.

181
00:15:30.854 --> 00:15:31.939
Gentlemen.

182
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.024
Good luck, gentlemen.

183
00:15:34.108 --> 00:15:35.776
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

184
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.779
During Korea,
the Navy kill ratio was 12-to-1.

185
00:16:21.238 --> 00:16:23.574
We shot down 12 of their jets
for every one of ours.

186
00:16:24.158 --> 00:16:26.410
During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-to-1.

187
00:16:26.493 --> 00:16:28.412
Our pilots become dependent
upon missiles.

188
00:16:28.495 --> 00:16:30.914
They had lost some
of their dogfighting skills.

189
00:16:31.415 --> 00:16:33.584
Now Top Gun was created
to teach A.C.M.

190
00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:35.085
Air Combat Manoeuvring.

191
00:16:36.003 --> 00:16:37.087
Dogfighting.

192
00:16:37.171 --> 00:16:38.756
This gives me a hard-on.

193
00:16:38.839 --> 00:16:41.759
By the end of Vietnam,
that ratio was back up to 12-to-1.

194
00:16:41.842 --> 00:16:42.843
Don't tease me.

195
00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:44.178
Blinds, please.

196
00:16:44.845 --> 00:16:46.096
Now I'd like to take this opportunity

197
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.515
to introduce you to
our commanding officer at Top Gun.

198
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.018
The very first man
to win the Top Gun trophy.

199
00:16:51.185 --> 00:16:54.188
You will not find a finer fighter pilot
anywhere in the world.

200
00:16:55.022 --> 00:16:57.691
Commander Mike Metcalf.
Callsign, Viper.

201
00:16:58.442 --> 00:16:59.943
Gentlemen.

202
00:17:00.778 --> 00:17:05.115
You are the top one percent
of all naval aviators.

203
00:17:07.284 --> 00:17:08.368
The elite.

204
00:17:09.036 --> 00:17:10.871
The best of the best.

205
00:17:11.288 --> 00:17:12.873
We'll make you better.

206
00:17:14.124 --> 00:17:16.126
You'll fly at least
two combat missions a day,

207
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.628
attend classes in between

208
00:17:17.711 --> 00:17:19.546
and evaluations of your performance.

209
00:17:19.963 --> 00:17:21.632
Now, on each combat sequence,

210
00:17:21.715 --> 00:17:23.717
you're gonna meet a different challenge.

211
00:17:23.884 --> 00:17:26.637
Every encounter is gonna be
much more difficult.

212
00:17:27.221 --> 00:17:28.639
We're gonna teach you to fly the F-14

213
00:17:28.722 --> 00:17:29.807
right to the edge of the envelope,

214
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.558
faster than you've ever flown before

215
00:17:32.226 --> 00:17:33.685
and more dangerous.

216
00:17:34.645 --> 00:17:37.147
Now, we don't make
policy here, gentlemen.

217
00:17:38.065 --> 00:17:41.068
Elected officials, civilians do that.

218
00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:43.570
We are the instruments of that policy.

219
00:17:44.404 --> 00:17:48.742
And although we're not at war, we must
always act as though we are at war.

220
00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:49.910
What are you doing?

221
00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:51.829
- The tip of the spear...
- I'm just wondering...

222
00:17:51.912 --> 00:17:52.913
...best be sharp.

223
00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:54.248
...Who's the best.

224
00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:57.084
In case some of you wonder
who the best is,

225
00:17:57.167 --> 00:17:59.336
they're up here
on this plaque on the wall.

226
00:17:59.419 --> 00:18:02.589
The best driver and his RIO
from each class has his name on it.

227
00:18:05.008 --> 00:18:08.428
And they have the option to come
back here to be Top Gun instructors.

228
00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:13.517
You think your name's
gonna be on that plaque?

229
00:18:15.352 --> 00:18:16.395
Yes, sir.

230
00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:20.107
That's pretty arrogant,
considering the company you're in.

231
00:18:23.527 --> 00:18:24.695
Yes, sir.

232
00:18:25.946 --> 00:18:27.781
I like that in a pilot.

233
00:18:29.199 --> 00:18:32.536
Just remember, when it's over out there,
we're all on the same team.

234
00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:38.375
Gentlemen, this school
is about combat.

235
00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:41.253
There are no points for second place.

236
00:18:42.796 --> 00:18:43.881
Dismissed.

237
00:18:43.964 --> 00:18:45.132
Nice going.

238
00:18:48.135 --> 00:18:51.805
The plaque for the alternates is
down in the ladies' room.

239
00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:58.312
Oh, Jesus. Oh, you kill me.
You really do.

240
00:19:01.398 --> 00:19:03.483
No,no,no,no.
There's two O's in "Goose," boys.

241
00:19:12.743 --> 00:19:14.077
Hi.

242
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:20.292
This is what I call
a target-rich environment.

243
00:19:20.667 --> 00:19:22.836
You live your life
between your legs, Mav.

244
00:19:23.253 --> 00:19:25.672
Goose, even you could get laid
in a place like this.

245
00:19:26.089 --> 00:19:29.176
I'm telling you, I'd be happy to find a girl
who'd talk dirty to me.

246
00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:35.349
Mav,

247
00:19:35.432 --> 00:19:37.017
you want to know who the best is?

248
00:19:37.601 --> 00:19:39.019
That's him. Iceman.

249
00:19:40.604 --> 00:19:43.106
That's the way he flies,
ice-cold, no mistakes.

250
00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.776
Just wears you down.
You get bored, frustrated,

251
00:19:45.859 --> 00:19:47.819
do something stupid, and he's got you.

252
00:19:49.613 --> 00:19:50.948
Hey, hey, Slider.

253
00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:53.700
Thought you wanted to be a pilot, man.
What happened?

254
00:19:54.034 --> 00:19:55.369
Goose, you're such a dickhead.

255
00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:56.787
Whose butt did you kiss to get in here?

256
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.956
Well, the list is long but distinguished.

257
00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:00.624
Yeah, well, so is my johnson.

258
00:20:01.041 --> 00:20:03.794
- So you're flying with Iceman?
- It's Mr Iceman to you.

259
00:20:03.877 --> 00:20:06.463
- Hey, Mother Goose. How's it going?
- Good, Tom.

260
00:20:06.546 --> 00:20:09.216
This is Pete Mitchell. Tom Kazansky.

261
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:11.843
- Congratulations on Top Gun.
- Thank you.

262
00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.303
Sorry to hear about Cougar.

263
00:20:13.387 --> 00:20:14.888
He and I were like brothers
in flight school.

264
00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:17.557
- He was a good man.
- Still is a good man.

265
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:19.017
Yeah, that's what I meant.

266
00:20:20.143 --> 00:20:22.562
- Thought so.
- Say, you need any help?

267
00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:25.357
With What?

268
00:20:25.732 --> 00:20:27.067
You figured it out yet?

269
00:20:28.485 --> 00:20:29.653
What's that?

270
00:20:30.737 --> 00:20:31.905
Who's the best pilot.

271
00:20:32.489 --> 00:20:34.741
No, I think I can figure
that one out on my own.

272
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:37.160
I heard that about you.

273
00:20:37.244 --> 00:20:38.412
You like to work alone.

274
00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.667
Mav, you must've soloed
under a lucky star?

275
00:20:43.834 --> 00:20:46.420
I mean, first the MiG, and then you guys
slide into Cougar's spot.

276
00:20:46.503 --> 00:20:49.006
We didn't slide into Cougar's spot.
It was ours, okay?

277
00:20:49.089 --> 00:20:51.717
Yeah, well, some pilots wait their
whole career just to see a MiG up close.

278
00:20:52.426 --> 00:20:54.261
Guess you guys are lucky and famous?

279
00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:55.846
No, you mean notorious.

280
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:57.931
I'll see you later.

281
00:20:58.765 --> 00:20:59.933
You can count on it.

282
00:21:01.351 --> 00:21:02.853
They were abused children.

283
00:21:04.354 --> 00:21:07.107
- We're gonna have a good time.
- Always.

284
00:21:10.444 --> 00:21:13.196
Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?

285
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.782
All right, the bet is $20.

286
00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:17.117
-$20.
- Right.

287
00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:18.952
You have to have carnal knowledge,

288
00:21:19.077 --> 00:21:20.620
of a lady this time

289
00:21:21.288 --> 00:21:23.373
-on the premises.
- On the premises.

290
00:21:25.292 --> 00:21:27.377
Come on, Mav. A bet's a bet.

291
00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:31.214
I don't know, it just...
It just doesn't seem fair.

292
00:21:31.298 --> 00:21:32.382
For you, I mean.

293
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:33.633
But...

294
00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:36.428
...she's lost that loving feeling.

295
00:21:36.636 --> 00:21:37.637
She's lost...

296
00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:39.056
- No, she hasn't.
- Yes, she has.

297
00:21:39.139 --> 00:21:40.891
- She has not lost that...
- Goose, she's lost it.

298
00:21:40.974 --> 00:21:42.059
Mav. Come on.

299
00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:45.437
I hate it when she does that. Shit.

300
00:21:51.026 --> 00:21:52.903
- Excuse me, miss.
- Hey, hey, hey.

301
00:21:52.986 --> 00:21:54.696
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.

302
00:21:55.489 --> 00:21:59.534
You never close your eyes any more

303
00:21:59.659 --> 00:22:02.496
When I kiss your lips

304
00:22:03.538 --> 00:22:06.666
There's no tenderness like before

305
00:22:06.792 --> 00:22:10.212
In your fingertips

306
00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.632
You're trying hard not to show it

307
00:22:13.715 --> 00:22:15.801
Baby

308
00:22:15.884 --> 00:22:17.844
But, baby

309
00:22:17.969 --> 00:22:21.515
Believe me I know it

310
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.852
You've lost that loving feeling

311
00:22:26.353 --> 00:22:30.315
Whoa, that loving feeling

312
00:22:30.398 --> 00:22:33.485
You've lost that loving feeling

313
00:22:33.568 --> 00:22:37.364
Now it's gone, gone, gone

314
00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:39.783
Whoa, whoa, whoa

315
00:22:39.866 --> 00:22:44.496
Ba-doom, ba-doom
ba-doom boom boom ba-doom

316
00:22:44.746 --> 00:22:45.831
Sit down.

317
00:22:45.914 --> 00:22:46.998
Ba-doom ba-doom boom boom
Ba-doom, ba-doom...

318
00:22:47.082 --> 00:22:48.416
Thank you.

319
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.127
Baby, baby

320
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:54.005
I get down on my knees for you

321
00:22:54.089 --> 00:22:55.882
Ba-doom, ba-doom
Ba-doom boom boom

322
00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:57.759
I love that song.

323
00:22:57.884 --> 00:22:59.386
I've never seen that approach.

324
00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:00.929
If you would only love me...

325
00:23:01.054 --> 00:23:02.681
How long have you two
been doing this act?

326
00:23:02.764 --> 00:23:04.558
Oh, I don't know, since...

327
00:23:04.724 --> 00:23:06.893
- Puberty?
'Right, puberty.

328
00:23:07.936 --> 00:23:10.230
- I'm Charlotte Blackwood.
- I'm Maverick.

329
00:23:10.605 --> 00:23:11.690
Maverick?

330
00:23:12.607 --> 00:23:14.568
Did your mother not like you
or something?

331
00:23:14.693 --> 00:23:16.361
No, it's my callsign.

332
00:23:16.778 --> 00:23:19.781
- You're a pilot.
- That's right, a naval aviator.

333
00:23:20.448 --> 00:23:21.491
Oh.

334
00:23:21.575 --> 00:23:24.327
No, actually, we've only done this, twice.

335
00:23:24.411 --> 00:23:25.912
Oh, how'd you do?

336
00:23:27.247 --> 00:23:29.624
Crashed and burned on the first one.
It wasn't pretty.

337
00:23:31.084 --> 00:23:33.170
- And second?
- I don't know. I'll tell you tomorrow.

338
00:23:33.253 --> 00:23:35.130
But it's looking good so far.

339
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.302
Well, uh, Maverick,

340
00:23:40.802 --> 00:23:43.930
my friend's just arrived,
so it's been great talking to you.

341
00:23:44.264 --> 00:23:45.390
- Perry.
- Hi.

342
00:23:45.473 --> 00:23:46.641
Hi. Here you go.

343
00:23:46.766 --> 00:23:49.144
Oh, I'll be with you
in just a second, okay?

344
00:23:51.313 --> 00:23:54.816
Listen, can I ask you
a personal question?

345
00:23:55.483 --> 00:23:56.735
That depends.

346
00:23:58.153 --> 00:24:01.114
Are you a good pilot?

347
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.617
I can hold my own.

348
00:24:04.284 --> 00:24:05.285
Great.

349
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:09.915
Then I won't have to worry about you
making your living as a singer.

350
00:24:16.963 --> 00:24:19.799
I'm gonna need a beer
to put these flames out. Yo!

351
00:24:20.842 --> 00:24:23.136
Great, Mav. Real slick.

352
00:24:47.535 --> 00:24:50.997
- It was a long cruise, was it, sailor?
- It was too long.

353
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:55.085
What did you wanna do, just drop
right down on the tile and go for it?

354
00:24:55.877 --> 00:24:58.004
No, I actually had...

355
00:24:58.088 --> 00:24:59.839
Had this counter in mind.

356
00:25:00.715 --> 00:25:03.218
Great, that would be
very, very comfortable. Yeah.

357
00:25:03.343 --> 00:25:04.552
It could be.

358
00:25:07.555 --> 00:25:10.225
Actually, I came in here
to save you from

359
00:25:11.017 --> 00:25:13.770
making a big mistake
with that older guy.

360
00:25:14.521 --> 00:25:15.522
Really?

361
00:25:16.564 --> 00:25:20.277
So I could go on to a bigger one
with a young guy like yourself?

362
00:25:22.862 --> 00:25:23.863
Maybe.

363
00:25:24.864 --> 00:25:25.907
No?

364
00:25:26.032 --> 00:25:28.159
I've gotta be at work
very early in the morning.

365
00:25:28.243 --> 00:25:29.536
Then what are you doing here?

366
00:25:31.371 --> 00:25:33.039
Your friend was magnificent.

367
00:25:38.753 --> 00:25:40.088
Nah.

368
00:25:42.382 --> 00:25:45.885
Now, you'll also be trained and
evaluated by a few civilian specialists.

369
00:25:46.386 --> 00:25:48.680
The civilians are here because
they are our very best source

370
00:25:48.763 --> 00:25:50.473
of information on enemy aircraft.

371
00:25:51.141 --> 00:25:53.435
One of the most qualified
is our TAGREP,

372
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.936
callsign, Charlie.

373
00:25:55.061 --> 00:25:57.188
She has a Ph.D. in astrophysics,

374
00:25:57.272 --> 00:25:58.940
and she's also a civilian contractor,

375
00:25:59.065 --> 00:26:00.692
so you do not salute her.

376
00:26:00.775 --> 00:26:01.901
But you better listen to her,

377
00:26:01.985 --> 00:26:04.321
because the Pentagon listens to her
about your proficiency.

378
00:26:04.612 --> 00:26:06.406
- It's all yours, Charlie.
- Thank you.

379
00:26:08.408 --> 00:26:09.451
Hello.

380
00:26:09.576 --> 00:26:12.746
We will be dealing with F-5s and A-4s

381
00:26:12.829 --> 00:26:14.331
as our MiG simulators.

382
00:26:14.622 --> 00:26:16.624
Now, then, as most of you know,

383
00:26:16.916 --> 00:26:19.544
the F-5 doesn't have
the thrust-to-weight ratio

384
00:26:19.627 --> 00:26:21.129
that the MiG-28 has.

385
00:26:21.796 --> 00:26:24.132
And it doesn't bleed energy
below 300 knots,

386
00:26:24.257 --> 00:26:25.592
like the MiG-28.

387
00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:26.801
However,

388
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:31.306
the MiG-28 does have a problem
with its inverted flight tanks.

389
00:26:31.765 --> 00:26:34.476
It won't do a negative-G pushover.

390
00:26:34.768 --> 00:26:36.144
- The latest intelligence...
- Are you gonna tell her?

391
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:38.021
-...Tells us that the most it will do...
- Nothing.

392
00:26:38.104 --> 00:26:39.814
...Is one negative...

393
00:26:40.815 --> 00:26:42.442
Excuse me, lieutenant.

394
00:26:43.276 --> 00:26:44.611
Is there something wrong?

395
00:26:44.694 --> 00:26:47.322
Yes, ma'am, the data
on the MiG is inaccurate.

396
00:26:48.948 --> 00:26:50.325
How's that, lieutenant?

397
00:26:51.201 --> 00:26:53.078
Well, I just happened to see
a MiG-28 do...

398
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:54.496
We, we.

399
00:26:54.621 --> 00:26:55.830
Sorry, Goose.

400
00:26:55.955 --> 00:27:00.126
We happened to see a MiG-28
do a four-G negative dive.

401
00:27:01.336 --> 00:27:03.046
Where did you see this?

402
00:27:04.172 --> 00:27:05.340
That's classified.

403
00:27:05.507 --> 00:27:06.633
It's what?

404
00:27:07.175 --> 00:27:08.551
It's classified.

405
00:27:09.052 --> 00:27:10.720
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

406
00:27:10.804 --> 00:27:13.473
Lieutenant, I have top-secret clearance.

407
00:27:14.015 --> 00:27:16.976
The Pentagon sees to it
that I know more than you.

408
00:27:18.686 --> 00:27:21.689
Well, ma'am, it doesn't seem so
in this case, now, does it?

409
00:27:22.524 --> 00:27:23.900
So, lieutenant,

410
00:27:24.651 --> 00:27:26.569
where exactly were you?

411
00:27:27.987 --> 00:27:29.823
- Well, we. ..
- Thank you.

412
00:27:30.198 --> 00:27:32.700
...Started up on his 6
when he pulled through the clouds,

413
00:27:32.826 --> 00:27:33.868
and then I moved in above him.

414
00:27:33.993 --> 00:27:35.912
Well, if you were directly above him,

415
00:27:35.995 --> 00:27:37.580
how could you see him?

416
00:27:38.331 --> 00:27:39.541
Because I was inverted.

417
00:27:39.666 --> 00:27:40.834
Bullshit.

418
00:27:42.335 --> 00:27:44.337
No, he was, man.
It was a really great move.

419
00:27:44.421 --> 00:27:46.047
He was inverted.

420
00:27:47.006 --> 00:27:48.591
You were in a four-G

421
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.553
inverted dive with a MiG-28?

422
00:27:51.886 --> 00:27:54.681
- Yes, ma'am.
- At what range?

423
00:27:54.764 --> 00:27:56.724
No. About two metres.

424
00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.726
It was actually about
one and a half, I think.

425
00:27:58.852 --> 00:28:00.645
It was one and a half.
I've got a great Polaroid of it.

426
00:28:00.728 --> 00:28:01.980
He's right there.
It must be one and a half.

427
00:28:02.063 --> 00:28:03.106
It was a nice picture.

428
00:28:03.189 --> 00:28:04.232
Lieutenant.

429
00:28:04.357 --> 00:28:05.358
Thanks, I like my pictures.

430
00:28:07.193 --> 00:28:08.903
What were you doing there?

431
00:28:09.904 --> 00:28:12.115
- Communicating.
- Communicating.

432
00:28:12.574 --> 00:28:15.243
Keeping up foreign relations. I was,

433
00:28:15.702 --> 00:28:17.537
you know, giving him the bird.

434
00:28:19.122 --> 00:28:21.875
- You know, the finger.
- Yes, I know the finger, Goose.

435
00:28:22.041 --> 00:28:24.419
I'm sorry, I hate it when it does that.
I'm sorry.

436
00:28:25.753 --> 00:28:26.880
Excuse me.

437
00:28:28.214 --> 00:28:29.424
So you're the one.

438
00:28:30.467 --> 00:28:31.593
Yes, ma'am.

439
00:28:32.927 --> 00:28:35.054
All right, gentlemen,
we have a hop to take.

440
00:28:35.805 --> 00:28:37.682
The hard deck on this hop
will be 10,000 feet.

441
00:28:37.765 --> 00:28:39.601
There'll be no engagement below that.

442
00:28:40.435 --> 00:28:41.728
Move it!

443
00:28:43.438 --> 00:28:44.981
...Disappear like that.

444
00:28:46.649 --> 00:28:47.942
Lieutenant.

445
00:28:49.944 --> 00:28:51.654
Okay, well, don't be late again.

446
00:28:51.779 --> 00:28:53.281
- You look great, honey.
- Thanks, dear.

447
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:54.782
See you in pref light.

448
00:28:55.283 --> 00:28:57.243
Lieutenant, why didn't you tell me

449
00:28:57.327 --> 00:28:59.287
that you were a famous MiG insulter?

450
00:28:59.746 --> 00:29:02.957
- Would it have made any difference?
- Not in the ladies' room, no.

451
00:29:03.583 --> 00:29:04.959
And what would've?

452
00:29:05.502 --> 00:29:07.128
I'm an instructor at this school.

453
00:29:07.253 --> 00:29:09.714
I see 20 new hotshots
every eight weeks.

454
00:29:09.797 --> 00:29:11.799
Now, I'm sure you can figure that out.

455
00:29:12.467 --> 00:29:13.801
Look, lieutenant.

456
00:29:14.844 --> 00:29:17.764
I'd just really like to hear
about the MiG sometime.

457
00:29:18.806 --> 00:29:20.767
You've got security clearance.

458
00:29:21.476 --> 00:29:23.269
You can read about it.

459
00:29:28.942 --> 00:29:30.151
Maverick.

460
00:29:31.986 --> 00:29:33.321
I'm curious.

461
00:29:34.489 --> 00:29:37.659
Who was covering Cougar

462
00:29:37.784 --> 00:29:40.161
while you were showboating
with this MiG?

463
00:29:40.995 --> 00:29:42.830
Cougar was doing just fine.

464
00:29:45.291 --> 00:29:46.834
Gentlemen, this is your first hop.

465
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.253
The jets you are flying against

466
00:29:48.336 --> 00:29:50.713
are smaller, faster
and more manoeuvrable,

467
00:29:50.797 --> 00:29:52.006
just like the enemy MiGs.

468
00:29:52.131 --> 00:29:54.968
The clock is ticking,
and as of now, we are keeping score.

469
00:29:55.969 --> 00:29:57.345
I lost him, Goose.

470
00:29:59.514 --> 00:30:00.974
Show me what you got, kid.

471
00:30:01.891 --> 00:30:04.310
- I lost him.
- I'm looking, I'm looking.

472
00:30:06.813 --> 00:30:08.815
I got him, I got him.
He's on our tail, coming hard

473
00:30:08.898 --> 00:30:11.359
Yeah, I got him. I got him. Here we go

474
00:30:24.247 --> 00:30:26.666
- All right, talk to me, Goose.
- He's still back there.

475
00:30:26.749 --> 00:30:28.501
He's closing in on us. He's closing fast.

476
00:30:29.377 --> 00:30:31.421
You can run, kid, but you can't hide.

477
00:30:35.842 --> 00:30:38.553
Come on, Jester. Let's see if I can
give you a run for your money here.

478
00:30:44.934 --> 00:30:46.436
Watch the mountains.

479
00:30:56.946 --> 00:30:58.948
I still got him. He's still back there.

480
00:30:59.032 --> 00:31:01.075
Come on, Mav.
Do some of that pilot shit.

481
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.535
Yeah, I got him.

482
00:31:12.587 --> 00:31:14.297
Come on, bring it right.

483
00:31:15.548 --> 00:31:17.133
Goose, I've had about enough
of this shit.

484
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.179
I'm gonna hit the brakes,
he'll fly right by.

485
00:31:21.262 --> 00:31:22.764
Okay, you're mine.

486
00:31:31.105 --> 00:31:32.398
Jesus Christ.

487
00:31:35.735 --> 00:31:37.487
Let's see what you've got now, Jester.

488
00:31:37.779 --> 00:31:39.989
Okay, Mav, let's turn and burn.

489
00:31:58.091 --> 00:31:59.717
He's going vertical, so am I.

490
00:31:59.801 --> 00:32:02.095
We're going ballistic, Mav. Go get him.

491
00:32:11.604 --> 00:32:12.647
He's going for the hard deck.

492
00:32:12.772 --> 00:32:14.857
Let's get down there first
and nail him, Mav.

493
00:32:14.941 --> 00:32:16.943
No way, Jester. You're mine.

494
00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.211
I got you now.

495
00:32:38.715 --> 00:32:40.007
Jester's dead.

496
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.719
Jester's dead.

497
00:32:45.638 --> 00:32:48.349
Get your butts above the hard deck
and return to base immediately.

498
00:32:52.353 --> 00:32:53.896
Yes, sir.

499
00:33:00.153 --> 00:33:02.864
Tower, this is Ghost Rider
requesting a flyby.

500
00:33:04.031 --> 00:33:06.200
Negative, Ghost Rider,
the pattern is full.

501
00:33:06.492 --> 00:33:08.661
No. No, Mav. This is not a good idea.

502
00:33:09.203 --> 00:33:12.081
Sorry, Goose
but it's time to buzz the tower.

503
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:26.012
Goddamn son of a bitch.

504
00:33:30.892 --> 00:33:32.518
Great balls of fire!

505
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:36.898
Jester's dead.

506
00:33:37.023 --> 00:33:39.108
You won? That's bullshit.

507
00:33:39.192 --> 00:33:41.861
- Didn't everybody?
- Hell, no, man, we got our butts kicked.

508
00:33:42.236 --> 00:33:45.198
Thirty seconds.
We went like this, he went like that.

509
00:33:45.364 --> 00:33:47.116
I said to Hollywood, "Where'd he go?"

510
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.952
Hollywood just said, "Where'd who go?"

511
00:33:50.369 --> 00:33:52.955
Yeah, and he's laughing at us,
right on the radio. He's laughing at us.

512
00:33:53.039 --> 00:33:54.707
No, it's me laughing, dickhead.

513
00:33:54.791 --> 00:33:55.833
We won.

514
00:33:55.917 --> 00:33:56.959
- All right!
- All right!

515
00:33:57.043 --> 00:33:58.169
- All right.
- All right.

516
00:33:58.252 --> 00:33:59.587
They won too, man.

517
00:34:00.129 --> 00:34:01.172
That's not what I heard.

518
00:34:01.255 --> 00:34:04.175
- No, we did, we got Jester.
- No, no.

519
00:34:04.258 --> 00:34:05.593
Below the hard deck does not count.

520
00:34:05.718 --> 00:34:06.928
Hard deck, my ass.

521
00:34:07.053 --> 00:34:08.596
We nailed that son of a bitch.

522
00:34:08.721 --> 00:34:10.097
You guys really are cowboys.

523
00:34:10.223 --> 00:34:12.058
What's your problem, Kazansky?

524
00:34:13.935 --> 00:34:15.394
You're everyone's problem.

525
00:34:16.062 --> 00:34:18.397
That's because every time
you go up in the air, you're unsafe.

526
00:34:18.898 --> 00:34:20.441
I don't like you
because you're dangerous.

527
00:34:20.566 --> 00:34:21.776
That's right.

528
00:34:22.568 --> 00:34:24.320
Iceman.

529
00:34:25.238 --> 00:34:26.489
I am dangerous.

530
00:34:29.575 --> 00:34:30.660
Maverick.

531
00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:32.954
You and Goose get your butts
out of that flight gear

532
00:34:33.079 --> 00:34:34.622
and up to Viper's office now.

533
00:34:38.626 --> 00:34:40.211
Remember, boys,

534
00:34:40.294 --> 00:34:42.088
no points for second place.

535
00:34:43.256 --> 00:34:45.216
- You're a lot brighter than you look.
- Oh, you shut up, okay?

536
00:34:45.299 --> 00:34:47.301
- Don't worry. Goose, don't worry.
- Okay, I will.

537
00:34:47.593 --> 00:34:50.388
Two of your snot-nosed jockeys
did a flyby on my tower

538
00:34:50.471 --> 00:34:51.806
at over 400 knots!

539
00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:55.142
I want somebody's butt. I want it now.
I've had it.

540
00:34:55.768 --> 00:34:58.229
- Oh!
- God damn it!

541
00:34:58.312 --> 00:34:59.814
That's twice.

542
00:34:59.939 --> 00:35:01.315
I want some butts!

543
00:35:02.984 --> 00:35:05.611
Well, that'll just about cover the flybys.

544
00:35:06.863 --> 00:35:08.281
Follow me.

545
00:35:12.785 --> 00:35:14.120
Gentlemen.

546
00:35:15.955 --> 00:35:18.207
You had a hell of a first day.

547
00:35:21.502 --> 00:35:24.380
The hard deck for this hop
was 10,000 feet.

548
00:35:24.964 --> 00:35:26.674
You knew it, you broke it.

549
00:35:27.216 --> 00:35:28.968
You followed
Commander Heatherly below

550
00:35:29.051 --> 00:35:31.637
after he lost sight of you
and called no joy.

551
00:35:33.723 --> 00:35:35.808
'Why?
- Sir!

552
00:35:36.517 --> 00:35:39.353
I had Commander Heatherly
in my sights.

553
00:35:40.313 --> 00:35:41.647
He saw me move in for the kill.

554
00:35:41.731 --> 00:35:44.400
He then proceeded
below the hard deck.

555
00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:48.070
We weren't below 10,000
for more than a few seconds.

556
00:35:48.654 --> 00:35:49.822
I had the shot,

557
00:35:49.906 --> 00:35:52.700
there was no danger, so I took it.

558
00:35:53.826 --> 00:35:54.994
You took it.

559
00:35:55.661 --> 00:35:57.872
And broke a major rule of engagement.

560
00:35:58.873 --> 00:36:00.041
Then you broke another one

561
00:36:00.166 --> 00:36:02.084
with that circus-stunt flyby.

562
00:36:04.879 --> 00:36:06.589
Lieutenant Mitchell.

563
00:36:06.672 --> 00:36:09.008
Top Gun rules of engagement
exist for your safety

564
00:36:09.091 --> 00:36:10.426
and for that of your team.

565
00:36:10.676 --> 00:36:12.678
They are not flexible, nor am I.

566
00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:16.682
Either obey them or you're history.
Is that clear?

567
00:36:19.018 --> 00:36:20.061
Yes, sir!

568
00:36:29.028 --> 00:36:30.112
Dismissed.

569
00:36:35.785 --> 00:36:37.870
I really enjoyed that, Mav, thanks a lot.

570
00:36:38.537 --> 00:36:39.872
Holy shit.

571
00:36:44.752 --> 00:36:46.712
Maybe I could learn how
to be a truck driver.

572
00:36:47.046 --> 00:36:49.215
Mav, you have the number of that
truck-driving school we saw on TV?

573
00:36:49.298 --> 00:36:50.716
Truck Master, I think it is.

574
00:36:51.092 --> 00:36:52.301
I might need that.

575
00:36:53.219 --> 00:36:55.137
His fitness report says it all.

576
00:36:55.471 --> 00:36:56.806
He's a wild card.

577
00:36:57.473 --> 00:36:58.516
Flies by the seat of his pants.

578
00:36:58.599 --> 00:36:59.892
Completely unpredictable.

579
00:37:01.268 --> 00:37:02.812
He got you, didn't he?

580
00:37:04.647 --> 00:37:05.731
Yeah.

581
00:37:06.148 --> 00:37:07.274
Maverick.

582
00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:10.486
I flew with his old man.

583
00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.117
Tell me one thing.

584
00:37:16.993 --> 00:37:19.286
If you had to go into battle,
would you want him with you?

585
00:37:19.412 --> 00:37:20.579
I don't know.

586
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:22.581
I just don't know.

587
00:37:35.511 --> 00:37:38.472
- You still awake?
- Yeah.

588
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.685
What's up?

589
00:37:43.769 --> 00:37:44.854
Can't sleep.

590
00:37:46.939 --> 00:37:49.275
You know, when I first realised
that we were going to Top Gun,

591
00:37:49.358 --> 00:37:51.527
all I could think about
was getting that trophy.

592
00:37:53.529 --> 00:37:56.032
I gotta be straight with you, Mav.

593
00:37:57.283 --> 00:37:59.368
Right now, I just hope we graduate.

594
00:38:01.537 --> 00:38:02.663
I got a family to think about.

595
00:38:02.788 --> 00:38:04.457
I can't afford to blow this.

596
00:38:08.669 --> 00:38:12.298
Yeah, I guess that flyby wasn't
such a big hit, huh?

597
00:38:16.469 --> 00:38:18.637
Look, man, I know it's tough for you.

598
00:38:19.221 --> 00:38:20.264
They wouldn't let you in the academy

599
00:38:20.347 --> 00:38:22.141
because you're Duke Mitchell's kid and

600
00:38:23.017 --> 00:38:24.977
you have to live with that reputation.

601
00:38:25.394 --> 00:38:27.063
But it's like every time we go up there,

602
00:38:27.146 --> 00:38:29.231
it's like you're flying against a ghost.

603
00:38:31.317 --> 00:38:33.152
It makes me nervous.

604
00:38:38.032 --> 00:38:39.658
You're the only family I've got.

605
00:38:40.743 --> 00:38:42.828
I'm not gonna let you down.
I promise you.

606
00:38:53.005 --> 00:38:54.215
Get out of here.

607
00:39:11.524 --> 00:39:14.235
A rolling reversal would work well
in that situation.

608
00:39:16.779 --> 00:39:19.949
But if I reversed on a hard cross,
I could immediately go to guns on them.

609
00:39:20.032 --> 00:39:22.201
Yeah, but at that speed, it's too fast.

610
00:39:23.619 --> 00:39:25.371
It's a little bit too aggressive.

611
00:39:26.622 --> 00:39:28.040
Too aggressive.

612
00:39:30.376 --> 00:39:31.627
Yeah, I guess when I see something,

613
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:32.920
I go right after it.

614
00:39:35.047 --> 00:39:36.924
You didn't tell me who you were
the other night.

615
00:39:37.466 --> 00:39:39.593
You didn't give me a chance, did you?

616
00:39:40.261 --> 00:39:41.637
You deserved it.

617
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:43.973
I know.

618
00:39:44.557 --> 00:39:45.641
But

619
00:39:46.225 --> 00:39:47.726
you were tempted

620
00:39:48.769 --> 00:39:50.563
to ask me out for dinner.

621
00:39:51.564 --> 00:39:53.232
- No.
- No?

622
00:39:53.315 --> 00:39:54.400
No.

623
00:39:54.733 --> 00:39:56.402
I don't date students.

624
00:40:05.995 --> 00:40:08.080
I can see it's dangerous for you.

625
00:40:08.581 --> 00:40:10.416
But if the government trusts me,

626
00:40:12.084 --> 00:40:13.794
maybe you could.

627
00:40:20.926 --> 00:40:23.345
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.

628
00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:39.612
Crash and burn, huh, Mav?

629
00:40:43.782 --> 00:40:44.783
Slider,

630
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.288
you stink.

631
00:40:59.673 --> 00:41:00.716
Let's go.

632
00:41:00.799 --> 00:41:02.218
Okay, Ice, yeah.

633
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.471
All set.

634
00:41:07.056 --> 00:41:08.515
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

635
00:41:08.641 --> 00:41:09.683
Back up, back up.

636
00:41:13.354 --> 00:41:14.480
Here it comes.

637
00:41:15.356 --> 00:41:16.440
That's good.

638
00:41:16.523 --> 00:41:17.566
Come on.

639
00:41:18.817 --> 00:41:19.818
Let's go, now.

640
00:41:30.329 --> 00:41:32.331
Come on, Mav, let's get them.

641
00:41:33.249 --> 00:41:34.875
Those guys are animals.

642
00:41:39.004 --> 00:41:40.089
Let's go!

643
00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.383
Go!

644
00:41:42.508 --> 00:41:43.842
Oh, good serve, good serve.

645
00:41:50.391 --> 00:41:51.517
All right!

646
00:41:52.601 --> 00:41:53.686
Yes!

647
00:41:55.187 --> 00:41:56.230
Yeah!

648
00:42:08.033 --> 00:42:09.368
That's game.

649
00:42:10.869 --> 00:42:13.664
Okay. Fake block.
Stay down. We'll just take them.

650
00:42:13.747 --> 00:42:14.873
Okay.

651
00:42:17.376 --> 00:42:19.586
Come on, where you guys going?
You walking away?

652
00:42:19.712 --> 00:42:21.505
We won, we won. Come on!

653
00:42:21.588 --> 00:42:23.215
Mav. Mav. Come on, man.

654
00:42:23.716 --> 00:42:24.967
Just one more game. That evens it up.

655
00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:26.593
- Come on, we can take them.
- No.

656
00:42:26.719 --> 00:42:27.720
No, we can, we got it.

657
00:42:27.803 --> 00:42:29.346
I got some things I gotta take care of.

658
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:31.223
Take care of? Just one more game.

659
00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:33.225
Please? For me?

660
00:42:33.309 --> 00:42:34.351
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.

661
00:42:34.435 --> 00:42:35.477
- Come on.
- Come on!

662
00:42:35.561 --> 00:42:37.062
- Mother Goose, you pussy!
- For me?

663
00:43:10.137 --> 00:43:11.305
Damn it.

664
00:43:23.776 --> 00:43:24.943
Lieutenant?

665
00:43:29.823 --> 00:43:32.785
- Yeah...
- What, no singing?

666
00:43:34.286 --> 00:43:37.664
- Look, I'm... I'm...
- No apologies.

667
00:43:46.131 --> 00:43:47.174
If you don't mind, I'm...

668
00:43:47.299 --> 00:43:48.467
I'm gonna just take a quick shower

669
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:51.011
while you're finishing up here.

670
00:43:52.888 --> 00:43:54.515
Yeah, I do mind.

671
00:43:55.974 --> 00:43:57.518
I'm hungry.

672
00:44:00.813 --> 00:44:01.980
And then

673
00:44:02.648 --> 00:44:04.066
I thought about it.

674
00:44:04.817 --> 00:44:05.984
I thought

675
00:44:07.319 --> 00:44:09.488
"You know, Charlie, he's a smart guy.

676
00:44:10.572 --> 00:44:12.866
"Why don't you just tell him
why you've got him here."

677
00:44:14.535 --> 00:44:15.828
Well?

678
00:44:17.162 --> 00:44:18.664
It's the MiG.

679
00:44:22.835 --> 00:44:23.919
The MiG.

680
00:44:24.878 --> 00:44:27.840
You're the only pilot
who's been up against a MiG-28.

681
00:44:31.176 --> 00:44:32.845
I'm trying for this big promotion at work,

682
00:44:32.928 --> 00:44:35.055
and if I get it,
I'm not gonna be here much longer.

683
00:44:36.765 --> 00:44:39.184
It seems to me you've got it
all figured out.

684
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:41.061
Yeah.

685
00:44:42.563 --> 00:44:44.523
Except you did forget the wine.

686
00:44:45.691 --> 00:44:46.775
Oh.

687
00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.528
Sorry.

688
00:44:50.571 --> 00:44:52.197
You always get what you want?

689
00:44:52.364 --> 00:44:53.699
No, not always.

690
00:44:54.867 --> 00:44:56.368
Yeah, maybe.

691
00:44:56.452 --> 00:44:58.203
Then relax about the MiG.

692
00:45:13.886 --> 00:45:15.053
This music.

693
00:45:17.806 --> 00:45:19.224
An old friend?

694
00:45:21.393 --> 00:45:22.436
My folks loved it.

695
00:45:23.729 --> 00:45:25.230
I haven't heard this in years.

696
00:45:27.566 --> 00:45:29.985
My mother used to
call down from her room

697
00:45:30.068 --> 00:45:32.738
and have me play this
over and over again.

698
00:45:32.905 --> 00:45:34.948
I got so sick of it.

699
00:45:37.409 --> 00:45:38.911
But not her, she...

700
00:45:39.953 --> 00:45:42.664
Just sit up there alone,
just listening, hours.

701
00:45:44.291 --> 00:45:45.584
Just listening.

702
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:51.256
She died shortly after him.

703
00:45:51.757 --> 00:45:53.091
What happened to your father?

704
00:45:59.097 --> 00:46:02.226
I guess I kind of figured,
with your security clearance,

705
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:04.811
you'd know more about him than I do.

706
00:46:06.605 --> 00:46:09.107
- Well, I didn't get that far.
- Oh.

707
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:12.819
Well, it's a big mystery.

708
00:46:14.988 --> 00:46:19.451
He disappeared in an F-4,
November 5th, 1965.

709
00:46:22.454 --> 00:46:23.956
The stink of it was,

710
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:26.667
he screwed up.

711
00:46:27.834 --> 00:46:28.877
No way.

712
00:46:30.128 --> 00:46:31.880
My old man was a great fighter pilot.

713
00:46:36.176 --> 00:46:39.388
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.

714
00:46:42.516 --> 00:46:43.976
Somebody must know.

715
00:46:44.643 --> 00:46:46.645
Yeah, somebody knows everything.

716
00:46:47.521 --> 00:46:49.982
Is that why you're always
second best up there?

717
00:46:52.192 --> 00:46:53.485
You are direct, aren't you?

718
00:47:03.036 --> 00:47:04.329
I'm sorry I was late.

719
00:47:06.999 --> 00:47:08.875
I'm sorry for being direct.

720
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:11.211
No apologies.

721
00:47:14.047 --> 00:47:15.882
This is gonna be complicated.

722
00:47:28.353 --> 00:47:29.855
Where are you going?

723
00:47:31.398 --> 00:47:32.899
I'm gonna take a shower.

724
00:47:37.195 --> 00:47:38.238
Thank you.

725
00:47:39.197 --> 00:47:40.907
I enjoyed being here.

726
00:48:19.279 --> 00:48:22.157
It looks like you need another shower.

727
00:48:24.117 --> 00:48:25.160
Right.

728
00:48:31.833 --> 00:48:33.418
I'm gonna be honest with you.

729
00:48:35.796 --> 00:48:38.924
Your MiG sighting is really
important to my work, but...

730
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.432
I don't normally invite
students to my house.

731
00:48:48.517 --> 00:48:49.976
You're...

732
00:48:57.943 --> 00:49:00.612
But... Please understand,
I still have a job to do.

733
00:49:03.156 --> 00:49:04.199
- Morning.
- Sir.

734
00:49:04.282 --> 00:49:05.617
Morning.

735
00:49:27.681 --> 00:49:30.016
I'm glad we got that straight.

736
00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:50.662
I told her how tough it is here.

737
00:49:50.871 --> 00:49:53.749
You know, my ass dragging
like an old, tired dog.

738
00:49:53.832 --> 00:49:55.709
I told her that you didn't
even have a woman here.

739
00:49:55.834 --> 00:49:56.835
Oh, really.

740
00:49:57.002 --> 00:49:58.044
You know what she said?

741
00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.713
Said, "Oh, he probably
doesn't have one,

742
00:49:59.838 --> 00:50:01.006
"he's got eight."

743
00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:10.849
- Hi!
- Daddy!

744
00:50:17.147 --> 00:50:18.356
So, Maverick,

745
00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:21.902
Goose tells me you're in love
with one of your instructors.

746
00:50:22.027 --> 00:50:24.571
- Is that right?
- I didn't tell her that.

747
00:50:24.696 --> 00:50:26.156
- Yes, you did.
- I...

748
00:50:26.364 --> 00:50:27.824
- Yes, you did.
- I can't believe you said that.

749
00:50:27.908 --> 00:50:29.743
- That was a secret.
- No.

750
00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:38.126
The bogey has good position right here.

751
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:39.920
All right, freeze-frame.

752
00:50:40.253 --> 00:50:41.671
Moment of choice.

753
00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.715
The F-14 is defensive.

754
00:50:44.007 --> 00:50:45.884
He has a chance to bug out right here.

755
00:50:46.384 --> 00:50:49.596
Better to retire and save your aircraft

756
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:52.182
than push a bad position.

757
00:50:52.766 --> 00:50:54.726
Charlie, jump in here anytime.

758
00:50:55.268 --> 00:50:57.562
Now, you stay in that diamond
another three seconds,

759
00:50:57.938 --> 00:51:00.398
the bogey's gonna blow you
out of the sky.

760
00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:03.485
You take a hard right, select zone five,

761
00:51:03.568 --> 00:51:05.529
you can extend an escape.

762
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.698
You made a bad choice.

763
00:51:09.783 --> 00:51:10.909
Charlie.

764
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:16.081
Aircraft one performs a split S?

765
00:51:16.581 --> 00:51:18.542
That's the last thing you should do.

766
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:20.377
The MiG's right on your tail.

767
00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:22.045
Freeze there, please.

768
00:51:22.879 --> 00:51:26.216
The MiG has you in his gunsight.
What were you thinking at this point?

769
00:51:27.092 --> 00:51:29.177
You don't have time to think up there.

770
00:51:29.261 --> 00:51:30.679
If you think,

771
00:51:30.762 --> 00:51:31.930
you're dead.

772
00:51:32.097 --> 00:51:33.223
Well, that's a big gamble

773
00:51:33.306 --> 00:51:35.559
with a $30 million plane, lieutenant.

774
00:51:43.066 --> 00:51:44.943
Unfortunately, the gamble worked.

775
00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:47.070
The MiG never got a clean shot.

776
00:51:48.321 --> 00:51:50.949
Maverick makes
an aggressive vertical move here,

777
00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:54.327
comes over the top, and he defeats
the bandit with a missile shot.

778
00:51:55.287 --> 00:51:56.997
The encounter was a victory,

779
00:51:57.122 --> 00:52:01.334
but I think that we've shown it
as an example of what not to do.

780
00:52:02.794 --> 00:52:03.962
Next.

781
00:52:05.088 --> 00:52:06.965
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.

782
00:52:11.094 --> 00:52:15.307
Now, then, this is a perfect example
of a textbook manoeuvre.

783
00:52:28.486 --> 00:52:29.654
Lieutenant.

784
00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:35.785
Maverick.

785
00:52:38.204 --> 00:52:39.331
Lieutenant.

786
00:52:40.832 --> 00:52:42.292
Lieutenant.

787
00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:45.420
My review of your flight performance
in the TACTS

788
00:52:45.503 --> 00:52:47.464
was right on,
in my professional opinion.

789
00:52:48.298 --> 00:52:49.716
I can't hear you.

790
00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:12.072
Jesus Christ!

791
00:53:12.197 --> 00:53:13.365
And you think I'm reckless!

792
00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:14.574
When I fly, I'll have you know

793
00:53:14.699 --> 00:53:17.077
that my crew and my plane come first!

794
00:53:17.202 --> 00:53:19.621
Well, I'm going to finish
my sentence, lieutenant.

795
00:53:19.704 --> 00:53:22.207
My review of your flight
performance was right on.

796
00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:24.084
- Is that right?
- That is right.

797
00:53:24.376 --> 00:53:25.752
But I held something back.

798
00:53:26.169 --> 00:53:28.129
I see some real genius
in your flying, Maverick,

799
00:53:28.213 --> 00:53:29.714
but I can't say that in there.

800
00:53:29.881 --> 00:53:31.758
I was afraid that everyone
in that TACTS trailer

801
00:53:31.883 --> 00:53:33.385
would see right through me.

802
00:53:33.718 --> 00:53:36.680
And I just don't want anyone to know
that I've fallen for you.

803
00:55:23.328 --> 00:55:24.788
- Hey, Maverick.
- Yeah.

804
00:55:24.871 --> 00:55:26.164
You hear about Ice?

805
00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:29.167
- What's that?
- He won another one.

806
00:55:29.834 --> 00:55:31.211
- Really?
- Yeah.

807
00:55:32.337 --> 00:55:33.713
I feel the need,

808
00:55:34.547 --> 00:55:37.008
-the need for speed.
- The need for speed.

809
00:55:41.221 --> 00:55:43.306
Gentlemen, this is hop 19.

810
00:55:43.389 --> 00:55:45.642
Multiple aircraft, multiple bogies.

811
00:55:45.725 --> 00:55:47.352
Your training is half over.

812
00:55:47.519 --> 00:55:50.188
The competition for the Top Gun trophy
remains tight.

813
00:55:50.313 --> 00:55:51.606
First place, Iceman.

814
00:55:51.689 --> 00:55:54.192
Second place, Maverick,
just two points behind.

815
00:55:56.027 --> 00:55:58.488
There they are.
Three miles, left, 10 o'clock.

816
00:55:58.571 --> 00:55:59.614
I don't think they see us yet.

817
00:55:59.697 --> 00:56:00.865
Okay, I see them.

818
00:56:01.032 --> 00:56:03.910
Two A-4s, left 10 o'clock level,
continue left turn.

819
00:56:13.211 --> 00:56:15.797
Good morning, gentlemen.
The temperature's 110 degrees.

820
00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.382
Holy shit, it's Viper.

821
00:56:17.882 --> 00:56:19.551
Viper's up here, great.

822
00:56:20.051 --> 00:56:21.219
Oh, shit.

823
00:56:21.719 --> 00:56:24.848
Great. He's probably saying,
"Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose."

824
00:56:24.931 --> 00:56:26.724
Yeah, I'm sure he's saying that.

825
00:56:30.353 --> 00:56:32.021
I've got my eye on the northern bogey.

826
00:56:32.105 --> 00:56:33.773
Roger. I got the southern guy.

827
00:56:36.234 --> 00:56:38.278
Hollywood, you've got the lead,
I'll cover you.

828
00:56:51.249 --> 00:56:52.625
Break now, Jester.

829
00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:59.716
Hollywood, we're losing Viper.
Let's just stay on Jester.

830
00:56:59.799 --> 00:57:00.925
Roger, I'm on him.

831
00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:07.932
Goose, find Viper.
He's out there somewhere.

832
00:57:08.057 --> 00:57:10.894
Stay with Hollywood, Mav,
we're covering his wing.

833
00:57:12.604 --> 00:57:15.106
Goose, there's Viper. 3 o'clock, low.

834
00:57:15.273 --> 00:57:17.442
Stay with Hollywood, Mav.
We're his cover.

835
00:57:17.567 --> 00:57:19.277
Don't you leave me, Maverick.

836
00:57:19.611 --> 00:57:21.446
Hollywood, you're looking good.

837
00:57:21.946 --> 00:57:23.448
I'm going after Viper.

838
00:57:26.492 --> 00:57:28.119
God damn you, Maverick.

839
00:57:28.244 --> 00:57:29.537
Mav, don't leave him.

840
00:57:29.621 --> 00:57:32.498
Goose, Hollywood's okay. I want Viper.

841
00:57:36.127 --> 00:57:38.504
Stand by. Viper's coming down.

842
00:57:44.969 --> 00:57:48.806
Holy shit, we're head-to-head.
I can't believe we're doing this.

843
00:58:03.488 --> 00:58:04.489
Rock 'n' roll.

844
00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:06.658
Here's our chance.
It's a big one, Goose.

845
00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:10.328
Come on, God damn it.

846
00:58:14.165 --> 00:58:15.708
Come on, Mav, keep coming.

847
00:58:19.963 --> 00:58:21.923
Okay. Sidewinder missile selected.

848
00:58:22.006 --> 00:58:24.008
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

849
00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:27.053
Come around, come around.
That's it, that's it.

850
00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.060
Jesus, this guy's good.

851
00:58:34.394 --> 00:58:36.187
Goose, where's he going?

852
00:58:36.312 --> 00:58:37.981
Come on, come on, come on,
keep coming.

853
00:58:38.064 --> 00:58:39.857
Keep coming!

854
00:58:43.194 --> 00:58:44.529
Come on, baby.

855
00:58:50.159 --> 00:58:51.703
Damn, this kid's good.

856
00:58:53.204 --> 00:58:55.540
He's too close for missiles, Goose,
I'm switching to guns.

857
00:58:58.918 --> 00:59:00.712
Come on, come on, come on

858
00:59:03.381 --> 00:59:05.842
Stick with me, stick with me.

859
00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.556
What... Hold it. Goose, check our tail.

860
00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:13.391
Shit. There's Jester.

861
00:59:13.683 --> 00:59:16.060
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.

862
00:59:16.185 --> 00:59:17.228
Shit.

863
00:59:18.229 --> 00:59:20.231
The Defence Department
regrets to inform you

864
00:59:20.356 --> 00:59:22.900
that your sons are dead
because they were stupid.

865
00:59:23.735 --> 00:59:25.778
Great balls of fire.

866
00:59:26.404 --> 00:59:27.989
Okay, knock it off, gentlemen.

867
00:59:28.072 --> 00:59:29.782
Let's go home. Viper has the lead.

868
00:59:35.538 --> 00:59:37.540
Thirty seconds, Wolf man,
and I'm coming in.

869
00:59:38.458 --> 00:59:39.542
Shut up!

870
00:59:39.625 --> 00:59:40.918
God, buttnose!

871
00:59:41.753 --> 00:59:44.130
That was some of the best
flying I've seen yet,

872
00:59:44.255 --> 00:59:46.424
right up to the part where you got killed.

873
00:59:46.758 --> 00:59:49.093
You never, never leave your wingman.

874
00:59:56.601 --> 00:59:57.769
Maverick,

875
00:59:59.771 --> 01:00:01.230
it's not your flying,

876
01:00:01.564 --> 01:00:02.982
it's your attitude.

877
01:00:03.775 --> 01:00:05.401
The enemy's dangerous,

878
01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:08.613
but right now
you're worse than the enemy.

879
01:00:09.155 --> 01:00:11.407
You're dangerous and foolish.

880
01:00:11.783 --> 01:00:14.911
You may not like the guys
flying with you, they may not like you,

881
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.288
but whose side are you on?

882
01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:29.133
Well, at least Viper got Iceman
before he got us.

883
01:00:30.134 --> 01:00:31.844
We still got a shot at it.

884
01:00:32.637 --> 01:00:35.306
That was stupid. I know better than that.

885
01:00:36.641 --> 01:00:38.476
It'll never happen again.

886
01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.314
I know.

887
01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:49.654
I know.

888
01:01:28.359 --> 01:01:31.154
You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain

889
01:01:31.737 --> 01:01:34.031
Thinking about your love
drives a man insane

890
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:35.533
You break my will

891
01:01:35.616 --> 01:01:37.034
Oh, what a thrill

892
01:01:37.201 --> 01:01:40.121
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

893
01:01:40.872 --> 01:01:42.832
Maverick, would you go fetch him?

894
01:01:43.207 --> 01:01:46.210
- Doesn't he ever embarrass you?
- Goose? Hell, no.

895
01:01:46.502 --> 01:01:48.880
- Well, there was the time...
- Admiral's daughter.

896
01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:51.299
- What?
- Come on.

897
01:01:52.216 --> 01:01:55.887
He told me all about the time
you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.

898
01:01:56.721 --> 01:01:58.890
Did he? Well, that's great.

899
01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:00.558
He tells me about all of them, Maverick.

900
01:02:01.392 --> 01:02:04.896
How my little angel, Goose,
goes home early for church,

901
01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:08.232
and you, you always go home
with the hot women.

902
01:02:08.316 --> 01:02:09.734
All right, thank you, Carole.

903
01:02:09.817 --> 01:02:12.570
I'm gonna go embarrass myself
with Goose for a while.

904
01:02:15.573 --> 01:02:16.824
Dancing!

905
01:02:18.743 --> 01:02:21.662
You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain

906
01:02:21.746 --> 01:02:24.415
Thinking 'bout your love
drives a man insane

907
01:02:24.749 --> 01:02:27.418
You broke my will, oh, what a thrill

908
01:02:27.585 --> 01:02:30.421
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

909
01:02:31.339 --> 01:02:33.508
I would love to be able
to warn you off about Maverick,

910
01:02:33.591 --> 01:02:35.593
but I just love him to death.

911
01:02:37.595 --> 01:02:40.264
You know, I've known Pete
for a lot of years now, and...

912
01:02:40.681 --> 01:02:42.767
I'm telling you, one thing's for certain.

913
01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:45.186
There are hearts breaking wide open

914
01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:47.063
all over the world tonight.

915
01:02:47.438 --> 01:02:48.523
Why?

916
01:02:48.606 --> 01:02:50.733
Because unless you are a fool,

917
01:02:51.275 --> 01:02:52.944
that boy is off the market.

918
01:02:53.277 --> 01:02:54.695
He is 100 percent,

919
01:02:54.779 --> 01:02:57.448
prime-time in love with you.

920
01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.952
Hey, Goose, you big stud!

921
01:03:01.118 --> 01:03:02.370
That's me, honey.

922
01:03:02.453 --> 01:03:04.539
Take me to bed or lose me forever.

923
01:03:04.705 --> 01:03:06.415
Show me the way home, honey.

924
01:03:08.459 --> 01:03:10.461
Come on, brother, sing with the family.

925
01:03:14.131 --> 01:03:16.884
You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain

926
01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.887
Thinking about your love
drives a man insane

927
01:03:20.137 --> 01:03:22.890
You broke my will, oh, what a thrill

928
01:03:22.974 --> 01:03:26.269
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

929
01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.745
Maverick,

930
01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:47.665
you big stud,

931
01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.835
take me to bed or lose me forever.

932
01:04:04.515 --> 01:04:06.517
Okay, gentlemen, this is hop 31.

933
01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:08.519
Two weeks to graduation.

934
01:04:08.603 --> 01:04:11.856
Top Gun trophy is still up for grabs,
so every point counts.

935
01:04:55.232 --> 01:04:57.234
Well, it's bottom of the ninth,
the score is tied.

936
01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.903
It's time for the big one.

937
01:04:58.986 --> 01:05:00.488
You up for this one, Maverick?

938
01:05:00.571 --> 01:05:02.907
Just a walk in the park, Kazansky.

939
01:05:06.911 --> 01:05:09.705
Contact. Multiple bogies, 165.

940
01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:12.083
Two miles.
Looks like they're going away from us.

941
01:05:12.166 --> 01:05:14.919
Ho, I see them, tallyho, right 2 o'clock
I'm in.

942
01:05:15.002 --> 01:05:16.253
I'm in.

943
01:05:36.273 --> 01:05:38.275
That son of a bitch cut me off.

944
01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:48.869
Come on, come on. Jesus Christ.

945
01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.538
Ice, take the shot.

946
01:05:50.621 --> 01:05:52.623
Come on, Ice, get the hell out of there.

947
01:05:52.707 --> 01:05:54.458
I can't get the angle.
I'm too close for missiles.

948
01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:55.960
I'm switching to guns.

949
01:05:57.211 --> 01:05:58.879
Ice, fire or clear.

950
01:06:05.219 --> 01:06:08.472
Look at this! Jesus Christ,
I can take a shot right here!

951
01:06:08.556 --> 01:06:10.808
I need another 20 seconds,
then I've got it.

952
01:06:16.313 --> 01:06:17.982
I'm moving in. I've got the shot.

953
01:06:18.065 --> 01:06:20.484
Come on, Mav, let's get in there!
Come on, Mav!

954
01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:24.321
Maverick's getting impatient, Ice.
Come on, take the shot.

955
01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:25.990
Ten more seconds, then I've got him.

956
01:06:27.825 --> 01:06:30.995
Come on, Ice, get the hell out of there!
Let's do it, Mav.

957
01:06:31.078 --> 01:06:32.747
Ice, come off high right. I'm in.

958
01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:35.666
- Five more seconds.
- Come off high right, Ice. I'm in.

959
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.334
I'm Off. Shit!

960
01:06:40.755 --> 01:06:42.006
We're in his jet wash!

961
01:06:42.089 --> 01:06:43.632
Ho! Holy shit!

962
01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:49.346
This is not good.
Shit, we got a flameout, Mav.

963
01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:51.098
Engine one is out.

964
01:06:51.182 --> 01:06:52.516
Engine two is out!

965
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.185
Goose, I'm losing control.
I'm losing control.

966
01:06:54.268 --> 01:06:57.354
I can't control it. It won't recover. Shit.

967
01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:01.776
It's coupling up, Mav!
We're out of control.

968
01:07:01.859 --> 01:07:03.861
This is not good! This is not good!

969
01:07:03.944 --> 01:07:05.529
Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.

970
01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.782
He's in a flat spin.
He's heading out to sea.

971
01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.871
Altitude 8,000, 7,000.

972
01:07:15.039 --> 01:07:18.042
Six. We're at six, Mav.

973
01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:22.671
I'm pinned forward, Goose.
I can't reach the ejection handle.

974
01:07:25.007 --> 01:07:27.051
Goose, you're gonna
have to punch us out.

975
01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:28.803
I can't reach the ejection handle.

976
01:07:28.886 --> 01:07:30.888
- Eject.
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

977
01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:32.515
Eject! Eject! Eject!

978
01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:34.350
Watch the canopy!

979
01:07:51.408 --> 01:07:54.245
Goose! Goose! Oh, no!

980
01:07:55.329 --> 01:07:56.413
Oh!

981
01:07:57.748 --> 01:08:00.334
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God.

982
01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:02.419
Oh...

983
01:08:15.015 --> 01:08:16.225
Oh, God.

984
01:08:47.798 --> 01:08:49.717
Sir, let go of him.

985
01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.886
You gotta let him go, sir.

986
01:09:35.012 --> 01:09:36.305
How you doing?

987
01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:38.140
I'm all right.

988
01:09:40.976 --> 01:09:43.479
- Goose is dead.
- I know.

989
01:09:48.025 --> 01:09:51.195
You fly jets long enough,
something like this happens

990
01:09:52.947 --> 01:09:56.158
He was my RIO, my responsibility.

991
01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:02.206
In my squadron in Vietnam,
we lost eight of 18 aircraft.

992
01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:03.832
Ten men.

993
01:10:05.292 --> 01:10:07.044
First one dies, you die too.

994
01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:10.005
But there will be others.

995
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.634
You can count on it.

996
01:10:15.552 --> 01:10:17.179
You gotta let him go.

997
01:10:20.724 --> 01:10:22.559
You gotta let him go.

998
01:10:40.494 --> 01:10:42.371
I think maybe it was my fault.

999
01:10:44.581 --> 01:10:46.417
Nah.

1000
01:10:48.168 --> 01:10:50.337
I don't know what the hell went wrong.

1001
01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:54.925
I'd like to help.

1002
01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:58.095
I know it's difficult.

1003
01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:05.102
God, I want him back.

1004
01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.361
I'll be here if you need me, okay?

1005
01:13:07.558 --> 01:13:10.144
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.

1006
01:13:28.412 --> 01:13:30.372
But he'd have flown anyway

1007
01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:32.499
without you.

1008
01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:37.421
He'd have hated it,
but he would've done it.

1009
01:13:59.109 --> 01:14:03.947
We find that the F-14 flat spin
was induced by the disruption of airflow

1010
01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:05.532
into the starboard engine.

1011
01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:09.453
This disruption stalled the engine,

1012
01:14:09.953 --> 01:14:12.873
which produced enough yaw rate

1013
01:14:12.956 --> 01:14:17.294
to induce a spin
which was unrecoverable.

1014
01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:21.465
There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell
could either see or avoid the jet wash

1015
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.300
which produced the engine stall.

1016
01:14:23.884 --> 01:14:25.469
Therefore, the board of inquiry finds

1017
01:14:25.552 --> 01:14:27.387
that Lieutenant Pete Mitchell
was not at fault

1018
01:14:27.471 --> 01:14:29.223
in the accident of 29 July.

1019
01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:31.767
Lieutenant Mitchell's record
will be cleared of this incident.

1020
01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:35.562
Lieutenant Mitchell is restored
to flight status without further delay.

1021
01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:38.815
These proceedings are closed.

1022
01:14:48.075 --> 01:14:50.077
Get him up flying, soon.

1023
01:15:17.104 --> 01:15:19.356
Come on, kid, come on.
Get in there. Engage.

1024
01:15:19.439 --> 01:15:21.608
All right, you got a bogey
at 2 o'clock low, Maverick.

1025
01:15:21.692 --> 01:15:23.694
You got the angle. Piece of cake, pal.

1026
01:15:27.364 --> 01:15:29.616
Take the shot, kid. Take the shot.

1027
01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.161
You can engage any time, Maverick.

1028
01:15:44.298 --> 01:15:46.550
- Hey, where the hell are you going?
- It's not good.

1029
01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:48.218
It... It doesn't look good.

1030
01:15:48.302 --> 01:15:49.636
What do you mean,
it doesn't look good?

1031
01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.388
It doesn't get to look
any better than that.

1032
01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:06.069
Hey, man, we could've had him.

1033
01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:08.488
Hey, we could've had him, man!

1034
01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.826
I will fire
when I am goddamn good and ready!

1035
01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:14.995
You got that?

1036
01:16:33.597 --> 01:16:35.891
He can't get back in the saddle.
Won't engage.

1037
01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:38.393
It's only been a few days.

1038
01:16:39.269 --> 01:16:41.396
You know, he just might
not make it back.

1039
01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:46.610
Keep sending him up.

1040
01:17:06.213 --> 01:17:07.589
Mitchell.

1041
01:17:08.965 --> 01:17:11.051
I'm sorry about Goose.

1042
01:17:14.805 --> 01:17:16.598
Everybody liked him.

1043
01:17:22.437 --> 01:17:23.772
I'm sorry.

1044
01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:45.293
Hi, it's Wolf man.

1045
01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:50.340
Yeah, Maverick just quit.

1046
01:18:12.821 --> 01:18:13.989
Excuse me.

1047
01:18:18.118 --> 01:18:19.161
May I?

1048
01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:21.163
Please.

1049
01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:30.464
Ill...

1050
01:18:30.547 --> 01:18:32.591
I'll have what he's having.

1051
01:18:32.757 --> 01:18:34.050
Hemlock, is it?

1052
01:18:34.968 --> 01:18:36.470
Ice water.

1053
01:18:41.391 --> 01:18:43.643
You weren't gonna say goodbye?

1054
01:18:45.395 --> 01:18:48.356
I heard you got that job in Washington.

1055
01:18:49.274 --> 01:18:51.860
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1056
01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:57.365
But I wasn't gonna leave
without saying goodbye.

1057
01:18:57.949 --> 01:18:59.117
Well...

1058
01:19:01.411 --> 01:19:03.246
It's good to see you.

1059
01:19:04.039 --> 01:19:05.290
Thanks.

1060
01:19:07.459 --> 01:19:09.085
Where you going?

1061
01:19:10.295 --> 01:19:12.923
You don't even have a ticket, do you?

1062
01:19:13.798 --> 01:19:17.344
Listen, I've seen all the evidence,
and it's not your responsibility.

1063
01:19:18.762 --> 01:19:20.347
It's not your fault.

1064
01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:24.726
You're one of the best pilots
in the Navy.

1065
01:19:25.977 --> 01:19:29.231
What you do up there, it's dangerous.

1066
01:19:30.815 --> 01:19:32.776
But you've got to go on.

1067
01:19:33.818 --> 01:19:35.862
No, you don't understand.

1068
01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:38.406
When I first met you,

1069
01:19:39.866 --> 01:19:41.910
you were larger than life.

1070
01:19:44.162 --> 01:19:45.580
Look at you.

1071
01:19:47.666 --> 01:19:50.544
You're not gonna be happy
unless you're going Mach 2

1072
01:19:50.627 --> 01:19:52.629
with your hair on fire, you know that.

1073
01:19:52.712 --> 01:19:54.339
No, it's over.

1074
01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:57.634
- It's just over.
- To be the best of the best

1075
01:19:57.717 --> 01:20:00.595
means you make mistakes
and then you go on.

1076
01:20:00.679 --> 01:20:02.055
It's just like the rest of us.

1077
01:20:02.138 --> 01:20:04.140
Oh, you don't think I know that?

1078
01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:08.645
I'm here to help.

1079
01:20:09.854 --> 01:20:12.023
Look, thank you.

1080
01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:17.445
But if I wanted help, really,
I would have asked for it.

1081
01:20:23.827 --> 01:20:25.453
So I'm too late.

1082
01:20:27.581 --> 01:20:29.374
You've already left.

1083
01:20:31.501 --> 01:20:34.170
You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?

1084
01:20:34.838 --> 01:20:36.423
Except to quit.

1085
01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:42.512
You've got that manoeuvre down
real well.

1086
01:20:50.562 --> 01:20:52.480
So long, Pete Mitchell.

1087
01:21:18.798 --> 01:21:20.717
Well, hi, Maverick, come on in.

1088
01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:22.594
- How are you doing?
- Good.

1089
01:21:22.677 --> 01:21:23.845
Really? You sure?
You sure you're feeling

1090
01:21:23.928 --> 01:21:25.472
-okay with everything?
- Oh, I feel great.

1091
01:21:25.555 --> 01:21:27.599
Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink

1092
01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:29.684
-or anything else like that?
- No, thank you.

1093
01:21:29.768 --> 01:21:30.810
Okay, well, why don't you just...

1094
01:21:30.894 --> 01:21:32.270
- Thank you very much.
-...make yourself comfortable

1095
01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:34.689
-because Mike will be right down, okay?
- Great, thank you.

1096
01:21:54.334 --> 01:21:56.044
I flew with your old man.

1097
01:21:56.294 --> 01:21:58.838
VF-51, the Oriskany.

1098
01:22:01.633 --> 01:22:03.677
You're a lot like he was.

1099
01:22:04.094 --> 01:22:05.637
Only better

1100
01:22:06.971 --> 01:22:08.556
and worse.

1101
01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:12.936
He was a natural heroic
son of a bitch, that one.

1102
01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:19.150
So he did do it right.

1103
01:22:23.863 --> 01:22:25.699
Yeah, he did it right.

1104
01:22:36.042 --> 01:22:38.336
Is that why you fly the way you do?

1105
01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:40.463
Trying to prove something?

1106
01:22:42.549 --> 01:22:44.884
Yeah, your old man did it right.

1107
01:22:46.302 --> 01:22:48.763
What I'm about to tell you is classified.

1108
01:22:48.847 --> 01:22:50.432
It could end my career.

1109
01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:53.309
We were in the worst dogfight
I ever dreamed of.

1110
01:22:54.978 --> 01:22:57.522
Bogies like fireflies all over the sky.

1111
01:22:59.649 --> 01:23:02.652
His F-4 was hit, he was wounded,
but he could've made it back.

1112
01:23:02.736 --> 01:23:05.905
He stayed in it,
saved three planes before he bought it.

1113
01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:10.452
How come I never heard that before?

1114
01:23:10.535 --> 01:23:12.954
Now, that's not something
the State Department tells dependents

1115
01:23:13.037 --> 01:23:15.707
when the battle occurred
over the wrong line

1116
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:16.958
on some map.

1117
01:23:18.376 --> 01:23:19.794
So you were there?

1118
01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.880
I was there.

1119
01:23:22.881 --> 01:23:24.674
What's on your mind?

1120
01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:27.635
My options, sir.

1121
01:23:29.012 --> 01:23:30.054
Simple.

1122
01:23:31.556 --> 01:23:34.017
First, you've acquired enough
points to show up tomorrow

1123
01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:36.311
and graduate with your Top Gun class.

1124
01:23:37.228 --> 01:23:38.646
Or you can quit.

1125
01:23:40.398 --> 01:23:41.858
There'd be no disgrace.

1126
01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:44.152
That spin was hell.
It would've shook me up.

1127
01:23:44.402 --> 01:23:46.070
So you think I should quit?

1128
01:23:46.446 --> 01:23:47.989
I didn't say that.

1129
01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:52.911
The simple fact is,
you feel responsible for Goose,

1130
01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:55.288
and you have a confidence problem.

1131
01:23:56.664 --> 01:23:59.501
Now, I'm not gonna sit here and blow
sunshine up your ass, lieutenant.

1132
01:23:59.918 --> 01:24:03.546
A good pilot is compelled to
always evaluate what's happened.

1133
01:24:04.714 --> 01:24:06.841
So he can apply what he's learned.

1134
01:24:08.009 --> 01:24:09.803
Up there, we gotta push it.

1135
01:24:11.304 --> 01:24:12.639
That's our job.

1136
01:24:15.141 --> 01:24:18.812
It's your option, lieutenant, all yours.

1137
01:24:31.115 --> 01:24:33.117
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir,

1138
01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:35.161
but thank you very much for your time.

1139
01:24:35.245 --> 01:24:37.539
No problem. Good luck.

1140
01:25:26.963 --> 01:25:28.131
Gentlemen...

1141
01:25:28.381 --> 01:25:29.757
- Where's Maverick?
-...here at Top Gun,

1142
01:25:29.841 --> 01:25:31.551
we challenged you
to fly against the very best.

1143
01:25:31.634 --> 01:25:32.802
I don't know where he is.

1144
01:25:32.886 --> 01:25:34.512
Now, we ask you to take
that expertise...

1145
01:25:34.596 --> 01:25:36.222
You know what he's planning to do?

1146
01:25:36.306 --> 01:25:38.391
...And keep the tradition alive.

1147
01:25:38.558 --> 01:25:39.934
Gotta be hard on the guy,
though, you know?

1148
01:25:40.018 --> 01:25:41.394
Good luck.

1149
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:15.094
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1150
01:26:16.930 --> 01:26:18.932
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mav.

1151
01:26:19.349 --> 01:26:20.558
Sir.

1152
01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:24.354
Gentlemen.

1153
01:26:25.188 --> 01:26:28.107
I hate to break up the party
before it really gets out of hand,

1154
01:26:28.191 --> 01:26:29.525
but there is work to be done.

1155
01:26:29.609 --> 01:26:32.278
Some of you have to
depart immediately.

1156
01:26:32.362 --> 01:26:34.072
We have a crisis situation.

1157
01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:35.990
Ice, Slider.

1158
01:26:36.074 --> 01:26:37.283
Yo.

1159
01:26:37.367 --> 01:26:39.202
- Hollywood, Wolf man.
- Yes, sir.

1160
01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:42.413
Maverick.

1161
01:26:42.497 --> 01:26:43.873
Sir.

1162
01:26:47.627 --> 01:26:50.129
Maverick, you'll get your RIO
when you get to the ship.

1163
01:26:50.713 --> 01:26:52.173
And if you don't,

1164
01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:54.467
give me a call.

1165
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:55.927
I'll fly With you.

1166
01:26:58.638 --> 01:26:59.764
Sir.

1167
01:27:09.065 --> 01:27:10.108
Gentlemen, this is bull's-eye.

1168
01:27:11.109 --> 01:27:14.696
The communication ship
SS Layton has become disabled

1169
01:27:14.779 --> 01:27:17.115
and has wandered into foreign territory.

1170
01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:19.534
A rescue operation is to begin
within the hour.

1171
01:27:19.617 --> 01:27:22.704
Your mission is to give
air support to that rescue.

1172
01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:25.873
There are MiGs in the area,
and tensions are high.

1173
01:27:25.957 --> 01:27:29.794
If you witness a hostile act,
you will return fire.

1174
01:27:30.962 --> 01:27:33.339
Those MiGs carry
the Exocet anti-ship missile.

1175
01:27:33.423 --> 01:27:36.092
They can fire that missile
from 100 miles away.

1176
01:27:36.467 --> 01:27:38.219
Gentlemen, this is the real thing.

1177
01:27:38.386 --> 01:27:40.596
This is what you've been trained for.

1178
01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:44.559
You are America's best. Make us proud.

1179
01:27:44.642 --> 01:27:46.227
- Ice.
- Yes, sir.

1180
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:47.395
- Hollywood.
- Yes, sir.

1181
01:27:47.478 --> 01:27:48.563
Sector two.

1182
01:27:48.646 --> 01:27:51.065
And Maverick, you back them up
with Merlin on Ready Five.

1183
01:27:52.692 --> 01:27:54.402
Yes, sir.

1184
01:27:55.528 --> 01:27:56.571
Rise!

1185
01:27:57.947 --> 01:27:59.407
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

1186
01:27:59.907 --> 01:28:02.744
This is not personal,
but with regard to Maverick,

1187
01:28:03.369 --> 01:28:04.662
is he the best backup that...

1188
01:28:04.746 --> 01:28:07.123
I know what's on your mind,
Kazansky, just get on it.

1189
01:29:23.991 --> 01:29:26.160
Mustang, when you get the chance,
can you give me a mode-four check?

1190
01:29:26.244 --> 01:29:29.664
Voodoo one, you've got a pair
of bogies, 12 o'clock, 15 miles.

1191
01:29:29.747 --> 01:29:34.043
Voodoo one, Voodoo one,
090 radar contact 15 miles.

1192
01:29:34.127 --> 01:29:35.795
They're doing 500 knots.

1193
01:29:35.878 --> 01:29:37.171
Roger, that's your bogey.

1194
01:29:40.383 --> 01:29:43.511
Got them dead ahead, 15 miles,
air speed is 600 knots.

1195
01:29:46.764 --> 01:29:48.891
Bogies' air speed, 650.
We're a little close together.

1196
01:29:48.975 --> 01:29:50.351
Let's take a wider split.

1197
01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:54.689
They're at 15,000 feet now,
dead ahead, ten miles.

1198
01:29:54.981 --> 01:29:56.315
Air speed is still increasing.

1199
01:29:56.399 --> 01:29:59.360
Eight hundred knots.
Dead ahead, now, 8 miles.

1200
01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:02.196
- Dead ahead, now, 8 miles.
- Wood, you got them?

1201
01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.531
Not yet, I can't see them.

1202
01:30:03.614 --> 01:30:05.408
They must be close,
I'm getting a hard-on.

1203
01:30:12.582 --> 01:30:14.876
Okay, Wood, I'm taking the lead.
Let's identify them.

1204
01:30:14.959 --> 01:30:16.669
Roger, Ice, you got the lead.

1205
01:30:16.752 --> 01:30:18.713
I'm on your left side, a little low.

1206
01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:23.092
- Maverick's up and ready in Alert Five.
- Good, good.

1207
01:30:25.511 --> 01:30:27.221
Hollywood, my bogey's still locked up.

1208
01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:29.223
He's drifting to the left.

1209
01:30:30.391 --> 01:30:32.518
Still manoeuvring, course 090.

1210
01:30:34.228 --> 01:30:37.231
Okay, Wood, let's bring it to the right,
and we'll get a better angle on them.

1211
01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:48.075
Ice, we got a problem here.

1212
01:30:48.159 --> 01:30:49.577
Now I'm breaking out
four aircraft on the radar.

1213
01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:52.163
Not one pair, two pair.
Repeat, four bogies.

1214
01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:53.664
Wood, we've got four bogies.

1215
01:30:56.834 --> 01:30:58.002
Wrong! Make that five!

1216
01:30:58.085 --> 01:30:59.128
There's five, sir.

1217
01:30:59.212 --> 01:31:01.130
- That's five?
- Yes, sir.

1218
01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:04.258
Oh, shit!

1219
01:31:04.884 --> 01:31:06.469
He's got a radar lock on us!

1220
01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:11.515
Get out of there, Hollywood!
Get out of there, goddamn it!

1221
01:31:18.731 --> 01:31:19.857
Break left!

1222
01:31:20.066 --> 01:31:22.318
I'm hit! I'm hit! We're coming apart!

1223
01:31:22.401 --> 01:31:24.111
I can't control it! Hold on!

1224
01:31:24.195 --> 01:31:25.821
Zero for twenty! We're going down!

1225
01:31:25.905 --> 01:31:27.114
Wood's been hit! Wood's been hit!

1226
01:31:27.198 --> 01:31:28.658
Shit! Wood's been hit!

1227
01:31:28.741 --> 01:31:30.868
Voodoo one! Wood's been hit!
Wood's been hit!

1228
01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:33.162
We've lost Hollywood!
Repeat, we've lost Hollywood!

1229
01:31:33.246 --> 01:31:35.831
- We've lost our wingman.
- Launch Maverick on Alert Five.

1230
01:31:35.957 --> 01:31:37.875
Get a bearing on
Hollywood and Wolfman

1231
01:31:37.959 --> 01:31:40.294
and launch the rescue
helicopter immediately.

1232
01:32:07.071 --> 01:32:09.073
- Maverick's airborne.
- Iceman, what's your position?

1233
01:32:09.323 --> 01:32:11.617
090 at 180 miles.

1234
01:32:11.701 --> 01:32:13.494
Yeah, we're coming in left!

1235
01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:15.997
Three MiGs, dead ahead,
coming down the left side.

1236
01:32:18.207 --> 01:32:20.543
I'm going after them.
I'm bringing it around to the left.

1237
01:32:23.421 --> 01:32:26.048
We got four on our tail!
That makes six of them!

1238
01:32:26.132 --> 01:32:28.342
Who do you think is hooking
in the guns range?

1239
01:32:32.847 --> 01:32:34.473
He's firing! Break right!

1240
01:32:36.475 --> 01:32:38.352
Mustang, this is Voodoo one,
we are totally defensive.

1241
01:32:38.436 --> 01:32:39.520
Launch the alert fighters.

1242
01:32:39.603 --> 01:32:40.646
Where? Where are they?

1243
01:32:40.730 --> 01:32:42.773
A hundred and sixty miles
and closing in fast, sir.

1244
01:32:42.857 --> 01:32:45.192
Ready Willard and Simkin
off CATs three and four.

1245
01:32:47.987 --> 01:32:50.239
Maverick's supersonic.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.

1246
01:32:50.323 --> 01:32:52.074
Move your ass! Get up here!
I'm engaged with five.

1247
01:32:52.158 --> 01:32:53.868
Repeat, five. I'm in deep shit!

1248
01:32:56.495 --> 01:32:57.747
What about Willard and Simkin?

1249
01:32:58.539 --> 01:33:01.042
Both catapults are broken.
We can't launch any aircraft yet, sir.

1250
01:33:01.459 --> 01:33:03.044
- How long?
- It'll take ten minutes.

1251
01:33:03.127 --> 01:33:05.463
Bullshit, ten minutes.
This thing will be over in two minutes.

1252
01:33:05.546 --> 01:33:07.048
Get on it!

1253
01:33:08.674 --> 01:33:11.052
One MiG, 12 o'clock high!
One MiG, 12 o'clock high!

1254
01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:13.721
Watch your back! Watch your back!

1255
01:33:18.601 --> 01:33:19.769
Break right!

1256
01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:23.481
Shit, that was close!

1257
01:33:23.606 --> 01:33:24.732
Maverick, how about
some help down here?

1258
01:33:24.815 --> 01:33:27.068
- Where the hell are you?
- Come on, kid, hang in there.

1259
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:31.072
Jesus Christ.

1260
01:33:33.115 --> 01:33:35.368
Maverick, how about some help?
Engage, goddamn it!

1261
01:33:37.495 --> 01:33:39.830
Maverick, we got a MiG on our tail.

1262
01:33:42.333 --> 01:33:43.876
Watch out! Watch out!

1263
01:33:46.295 --> 01:33:48.672
Shit, we just flew
right through his jet wash.

1264
01:33:50.883 --> 01:33:52.802
Get control, Mav! Get control!

1265
01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:01.811
Good recovery, Mav.

1266
01:34:02.269 --> 01:34:03.813
Okay, let's get in there.

1267
01:34:03.979 --> 01:34:05.731
Come on, we gotta help Ice.

1268
01:34:05.898 --> 01:34:07.900
Come on, let's get back
in the game, Maverick!

1269
01:34:07.983 --> 01:34:10.027
- Come on! Get in there, Maverick!
- No. It's no good.

1270
01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:11.612
It's no good.

1271
01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:15.783
God damn it! Maverick's disengaging!

1272
01:34:15.866 --> 01:34:17.326
I knew it! Shit!

1273
01:34:17.410 --> 01:34:18.869
God damn it, Maverick!

1274
01:34:22.081 --> 01:34:23.624
Get in there, Maverick!
You can't leave him!

1275
01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:26.085
Come on! Maverick!
What the hell are you doing?

1276
01:34:26.168 --> 01:34:27.211
Talk to me, Goose.

1277
01:34:27.294 --> 01:34:28.337
Maverick, get in there, for Christ's sake!

1278
01:34:28.421 --> 01:34:30.423
- Ice is in trouble!
- Talk to me, Goose

1279
01:34:30.506 --> 01:34:32.591
Get in there, Maverick!
He won't last down there alone!

1280
01:34:32.675 --> 01:34:34.135
Get in the fight, for Christ's sake!

1281
01:34:34.218 --> 01:34:36.679
Maverick! Maverick!

1282
01:34:39.515 --> 01:34:41.100
Maverick's reengaging, sir.

1283
01:34:46.897 --> 01:34:49.859
- I can't get him off my tail!
- Ice, I've got your MiG dead ahead.

1284
01:34:49.942 --> 01:34:51.360
I've got him dead ahead.

1285
01:34:52.945 --> 01:34:54.572
Good tone. I've got good tone.

1286
01:34:55.281 --> 01:34:57.158
I've got tone! I've got tone! Firing!

1287
01:35:08.252 --> 01:35:10.671
- Where? Where are they?
- A hundred and fifty-five miles.

1288
01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:13.174
Two MiGs, dead ahead.
Closing at 800 miles an hour.

1289
01:35:13.257 --> 01:35:15.551
I see them. I see them.
I'm gonna take them down the left side.

1290
01:35:17.970 --> 01:35:19.221
Oh, my God.

1291
01:35:22.349 --> 01:35:24.560
Ice is right below us.
He's got a MiG on his tail.

1292
01:35:26.937 --> 01:35:29.023
He's firing! Break left! Break left!

1293
01:35:32.359 --> 01:35:34.487
He overshot! He overshot!

1294
01:35:35.154 --> 01:35:36.864
Coming in, Ice. I'm coming in.

1295
01:35:39.533 --> 01:35:41.035
I got two MiGs dead ahead.

1296
01:35:42.161 --> 01:35:44.371
I got him, Mav.
One MiG passing between us.

1297
01:35:48.834 --> 01:35:51.045
You got a MiG on your left. On your left!
3 o'clock!

1298
01:35:51.128 --> 01:35:52.796
He's gonna fire, he's gonna fire!

1299
01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:01.263
Maverick, check the guys to the north!

1300
01:36:01.347 --> 01:36:02.890
Check the guys to the north!

1301
01:36:05.601 --> 01:36:07.561
Banking left. Banking left.

1302
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:12.233
There he is. Get him, Ice. Get him!

1303
01:36:12.399 --> 01:36:13.901
Okay, you guys, I'm coming in!

1304
01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:20.574
Maverick, we got a MiG
coming around on our tail!

1305
01:36:20.658 --> 01:36:23.244
- We gotta get out of here!
- I can't leave Ice.

1306
01:36:23.327 --> 01:36:25.746
He's still coming around!
He's gonna get behind us!

1307
01:36:26.205 --> 01:36:27.998
I'm not leaving my wingman.

1308
01:36:31.001 --> 01:36:33.212
I'm on his tail. I'm on his tail.
I'm going for it.

1309
01:36:33.295 --> 01:36:35.214
I'm going for it.
I'm going for the shot right now.

1310
01:36:35.297 --> 01:36:36.924
Roger. Engaged.

1311
01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:40.511
I've got radar lock.

1312
01:36:41.178 --> 01:36:42.972
Good tone. I'm taking a shot.

1313
01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:44.265
Fire!

1314
01:36:48.143 --> 01:36:50.437
- Bingo!
- Wash that sucker, yeah!

1315
01:36:50.521 --> 01:36:52.147
Ice, watch out.
There's a MiG to your right.

1316
01:36:52.231 --> 01:36:53.399
He's firing!

1317
01:36:55.276 --> 01:36:56.610
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1318
01:36:58.779 --> 01:37:00.322
We're hit! We're hit in the right engine!

1319
01:37:00.406 --> 01:37:02.116
I'm shutting it down!
I'm shutting it down!

1320
01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.372
Coming in, Ice. Coming in.

1321
01:37:11.834 --> 01:37:14.628
Ice, that bogey's still behind you.
I'm manoeuvring for a shot.

1322
01:37:14.878 --> 01:37:16.630
Stay with him, Mav, stay with him!

1323
01:37:16.714 --> 01:37:18.048
Take the shot! Nail him! Nail him!

1324
01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:19.967
Shit. Ice, I can't get a tone.

1325
01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:22.136
Shoot, Maverick!
I can't get him off my tail!

1326
01:37:26.724 --> 01:37:27.975
Maverick, we're hit! We're hit again!

1327
01:37:28.058 --> 01:37:30.269
It's okay. Both engines are functioning.
We're okay.

1328
01:37:30.352 --> 01:37:32.813
Ice, on the count of three,
break hard right.

1329
01:37:33.772 --> 01:37:34.815
Three,

1330
01:37:34.898 --> 01:37:35.983
two,

1331
01:37:36.066 --> 01:37:37.943
one. Break right!

1332
01:37:40.946 --> 01:37:42.031
Firing!

1333
01:37:45.701 --> 01:37:46.952
Damn it, I missed!

1334
01:37:47.036 --> 01:37:49.788
Don't let him go. Keep on him, Mav.
Keep on him.

1335
01:37:49.872 --> 01:37:51.457
I got him. I got him.

1336
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.585
Here comes a shot.

1337
01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.133
Scratch three!

1338
01:38:03.218 --> 01:38:04.678
Maverick, move!
There's a MiG on your tail!

1339
01:38:04.762 --> 01:38:05.971
There's a MiG on your tail!

1340
01:38:06.055 --> 01:38:07.931
We've got a problem here.
We've only got one missile left.

1341
01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:09.725
Approaching 110 miles, sir.

1342
01:38:09.808 --> 01:38:11.018
God damn it.

1343
01:38:11.101 --> 01:38:12.353
I got him! I got him! He's right on us!

1344
01:38:12.436 --> 01:38:13.812
He's between our tails!

1345
01:38:16.732 --> 01:38:18.150
Shit.

1346
01:38:21.445 --> 01:38:23.030
You haven't lost him. He's still with us!

1347
01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:28.661
What are you doing?
You're slowing down!

1348
01:38:28.744 --> 01:38:29.870
You're slowing down!

1349
01:38:29.953 --> 01:38:31.330
I'm bringing him in closer, Merlin.

1350
01:38:31.413 --> 01:38:32.706
You're gonna do what?

1351
01:38:37.670 --> 01:38:39.254
This is it, Maverick!

1352
01:38:39.338 --> 01:38:41.048
I'm gonna hit the brakes,
he'll fly right by.

1353
01:38:41.131 --> 01:38:42.716
Shit! He's gonna get a lock on us!

1354
01:38:46.095 --> 01:38:47.471
Now!

1355
01:38:52.309 --> 01:38:54.561
I got a good lock. Firing.

1356
01:38:59.483 --> 01:39:00.734
Scratch four!

1357
01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:06.740
Mustang, this is Voodoo three.

1358
01:39:06.824 --> 01:39:08.534
Remaining MiGs are bugging out.

1359
01:39:23.507 --> 01:39:26.468
Mustang, this is Maverick
requesting flyby.

1360
01:39:27.511 --> 01:39:29.263
Negative, Ghost Rider.
The pattern is full.

1361
01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:34.143
Excuse me.
Something I should know about?

1362
01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:47.990
Thank you.

1363
01:39:53.412 --> 01:39:55.080
God damn that guy.

1364
01:40:19.104 --> 01:40:20.481
Yes!

1365
01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:50.552
What the hell happened
to you guys? Hollywood!

1366
01:40:51.094 --> 01:40:52.137
You!

1367
01:40:55.933 --> 01:40:57.518
You are still dangerous.

1368
01:41:01.855 --> 01:41:04.066
You can be my wingman anytime.

1369
01:41:05.317 --> 01:41:06.443
Bullshit.

1370
01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:07.903
You can be mine.

1371
01:41:59.997 --> 01:42:01.665
- Maverick.
- Sir.

1372
01:42:01.874 --> 01:42:03.375
How does it feel to be on the front page

1373
01:42:03.458 --> 01:42:04.793
of every newspaper
in the English-speaking world?

1374
01:42:06.044 --> 01:42:07.838
Even though the other side
denies the incident.

1375
01:42:07.921 --> 01:42:09.590
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

1376
01:42:09.882 --> 01:42:11.258
They gave you your choice of duty, son.

1377
01:42:11.341 --> 01:42:13.176
Anything, anywhere.
Do you believe that shit?

1378
01:42:13.844 --> 01:42:16.388
Where do you think you wanna go?

1379
01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:19.141
I thought of being an instructor, sir.

1380
01:42:20.225 --> 01:42:21.435
Top Gun?

1381
01:42:21.935 --> 01:42:23.061
Yes, sir.

1382
01:42:23.645 --> 01:42:24.813
God help us.

1383
01:43:45.394 --> 01:43:46.395
Hello, Pete Mitchell.

1384
01:43:52.067 --> 01:43:54.194
I heard the best of the best
were gonna be back here,

1385
01:43:54.277 --> 01:43:55.821
SO...

1386
01:44:01.076 --> 01:44:02.744
This could be complicated.

1387
01:44:04.746 --> 01:44:08.583
You know, on the first one,
I crashed and burned.

1388
01:44:10.168 --> 01:44:11.253
And the second?

1389
01:44:18.677 --> 01:44:19.928
I don't know,

1390
01:44:21.096 --> 01:44:25.100
but it's looking good so far.
