2
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,827
[Parker] I can see why
you picked this place.

3
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:35,565
It's beautiful.

4
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:38,601
It's okay.

5
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:40,623
We were never gonna stay here for long.

6
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,566
I love staring out at the ocean.

7
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,195
It's so calming.

8
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:49,162
You know I'd never
seen the ocean before?

9
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:52,949
Not as a child.

10
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,278
Not at the institute.
This is the first time.

11
00:00:58,455 --> 00:01:00,111
I had no idea.

12
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:01,721
I love the waves.

13
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:06,936
Just staring at them...

14
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,586
calms me down.

15
00:01:08,857 --> 00:01:10,832
Calms you down about what?

16
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,217
I've been thinking about how
people have different... needs...

17
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:20,101
different reasons for existing.

18
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:22,144
Being confronted with what I want,

19
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:23,579
not being what you want,

20
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:25,605
not being what someone else wants.

21
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:27,284
It just...

22
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:30,443
surprised me.

23
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:32,864
You were surprised by that?

24
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:35,643
I suppose what I'm trying to say is,

25
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:38,064
I never had a desire
to leave the institute,

26
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:41,802
disregard everything I've
learned, abandon all my friends.

27
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:45,376
I never felt the need to just
leave and take 60 people with me.

28
00:01:45,377 --> 00:01:47,796
Everything you've learned. [chuckles]

29
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:50,010
What have you learned there, Parker?

30
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:51,766
Well, it helped me.

31
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:55,578
I felt protected by it, elevated by it.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,474
And the institute teaches a freedom
that does not exist out here.

33
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:01,667
Can you stop calling it an institute?

34
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:04,736
It's a cult. It's a fucking cult.

35
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:07,420
You know, it's strange.

36
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:12,099
Kevin had told me to
do whatever it takes...

37
00:02:12,124 --> 00:02:13,955
to get you and bring you back.

38
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,482
"Whatever it takes," he said.
Then the other night, you just...

39
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:19,655
you just waltz in as if
it's another ordinary day.

40
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:24,327
"Whatever it takes." Sometimes
I wonder what that means.

41
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:29,145
He was probably giving
you permission to kill me.

42
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:32,659
[no audible dialogue]

43
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:46,986
So at what point did you
decide to leave the program?

44
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:49,689
I'd be dead if I
hadn't left the program.

45
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:52,300
Why are you being so
dramatic and negative?

46
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:54,328
Honestly, I don't understand...

47
00:02:54,353 --> 00:02:56,454
No, you don't understand, all right?

48
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,675
I would've slit my own fucking throat

49
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,168
if I'd be there any longer, all right?

50
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:01,907
Instead you're what?

51
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:04,176
What are you?

52
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:07,865
Where are you? Out here you're nothing.

53
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,992
In LA, you're going nowhere.

54
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:12,081
You have no one.

55
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:14,075
So why did you do this?

56
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,924
If you're here to take me back,

57
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:36,005
or reprogram me or whatever it is, man,

58
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,294
just don't-don't drag it.
Just-just kill me.

59
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,391
Drag what out?

60
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,845
Why-why do you think
someone wants to kill you?

61
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:45,893
Did you ever hear about... Tier Four?

62
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:49,990
- It was part of the institute.
- Tier Four?

63
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:52,854
No, I don't know. What is that?

64
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:55,495
It was located in Seattle.

65
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,007
Only a few people knew about it.

66
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:59,204
It was supposed to be kept a secret.

67
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:01,870
Secret why?

68
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:06,754
Certain things happened in Tier Four
that didn't happen in the compound.

69
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:09,733
Did you really never hear about this?

70
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:11,765
No.

71
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,297
Really?

72
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:18,600
[Logan] <i>So you don't know anything
about the Russian connection,</i>

73
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,916
<i>the Chinese connection,
the deep Web stuff?</i>

74
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:24,198
<i>I mean, I'm assuming since you're here,</i>

75
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,391
<i>you've been chosen for
the assignment, that...</i>

76
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,027
<i>you must've known certain things.</i>

77
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,424
[Parker] <i>No.</i>

78
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:33,878
[Logan] <i>Ted Lonergan
might've had some cool ideas</i>

79
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,034
<i>about evolution and about
the idea of freedom.</i>

80
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:40,100
<i>All cool things.</i>

81
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:43,335
<i>One of the reasons why I was there.</i>

82
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:46,365
<i>They got fucked up along the way.</i>

83
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,761
<i>- Very fucked up.</i>
- [Parker] <i>What are you talking about?</i>

84
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,622
[Logan] <i>I don't think
he intended torture,</i>

85
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:53,920
<i>and violence and rape...</i>

86
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:55,994
<i>to be the endgame.</i>

87
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:58,312
<i>Once that door was open,</i>

88
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:01,076
<i>once that possibility was tasted,</i>

89
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,119
it was impossible to shut that door.

90
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:05,151
I've never seen any of
that at the institute.

91
00:05:05,176 --> 00:05:08,136
And yet you took care
of the Genesis patient.

92
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,180
Breeda.

93
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:14,144
I mean, you saw what they did to her.

94
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,551
You don't consider
that a form of torture?

95
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:19,459
Uh, I wasn't a part of that. I was...

96
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:23,699
I was just a handler. I
took care of her afterwards.

97
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,238
And yet you were cool
with the little experiment?

98
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,913
Trying to see if they
can raise a follower?

99
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,379
[chuckles]

100
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:32,686
I mean, I was there.

101
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:35,106
I saw what they did to
her, and it was fucked up.

102
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,635
Breeda's here with me now.
I'm taking care of her.

103
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,815
Really? She is?

104
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:47,550
I'm surprised they let that
monster out of the institute.

105
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:49,625
Or did you?

106
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,577
I'm gonna show you something.

107
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:06,889
[Logan] She's dead.

108
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:09,351
Gwen Douglas is dead.

109
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,222
How?

110
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:15,409
She committed suicide.

111
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:21,333
[Parker] Sorry.

112
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:26,324
Ryder's still out there, though.

113
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:30,900
You want to find him, right?

114
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:40,148
We want to reach out to everybody.

115
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:43,632
I saw him yesterday.

116
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:45,968
He wanted to run away with Agatha,

117
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:47,970
get out of California.

118
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:52,083
But for some reason, I just
don't think you want to find him.

119
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,109
You want to leave him alone.

120
00:06:54,134 --> 00:06:56,010
I mean, if Agatha's
here and Ryder isn't,

121
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:58,638
it just makes me think
you didn't try hard enough.

122
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:02,178
You said you wanted to use this.

123
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,583
Where is this?

124
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:01,415
This was actually shot

125
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,910
in Tier Four about a year ago.

126
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,254
I don't understand.

127
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:08,977
Just watch.

128
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:44,295
What the fuck?

129
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,566
I-I can't watch that
anymore. What was that?

130
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:50,320
Why did you show that to me?

131
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,479
That's what happens on Tier Four.

132
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:57,332
I can't go back.

133
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:02,431
Are you gonna let me go?

134
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,463
I can't go back without you.

135
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:10,637
Then I want you to kill me.

136
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:40,143
She's back.

137
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:57,524
[Logan] So your brother has come
back to the scene of the crime.

138
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:01,114
Did you miss him?

139
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:06,172
[Logan] <i>Ryder?</i>

140
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,511
<i>Your brother.</i>

141
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,617
[gunshot]
