1
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,136
The house is sold out,
my lord.

2
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,605
No further incidents, I trust?

3
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,242
No, nothing.
Everything seems quite normal.

4
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,348


5
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,148


6
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,961
From his Lordship, Madam.

7
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,792
Is this all?
Yes, Madam.

8
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:01,232
Last time there were diamonds.
Put them
with the others, Teresa.

9
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,207


10
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,269
Teresa, is that you?

11
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,351
Teresa, come
and help me button my dress.

12
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,610
What is it now?
It's Maria.
She said she's seen something.

13
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,682
Leave me alone. Go away.

14
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,824
Maria.
Harry.

15
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,664
Harry. It was here,
in the room.

16
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,601
It was terrible.

17
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,608
Now, Maria...
"Now, Maria," nothing.

18
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,367
I saw him, I tell you.

19
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,870
Standing just over here.

20
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,443
Just here.

21
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,178
Black.

22
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,455
All over, black.

23
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,483
And his eye, staring at me.

24
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,623
His eye?
Eye.

25
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,422
One eye
in the mile of his forehead.

26
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,324
And his face, Harry.

27
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,663
It was horrible.

28
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,933
Maria, I'm sure
you saw something.

29
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,203
Exactly what it was...
It was him.

30
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,400
After the show,
we'll try and find out.

31
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,702
Harry, I can't go on tonight.

32
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,871
Of course you can.
You're an artist.

33
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,216
You're not going to let
a little thing
like a ghost upset you.

34
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,808
So, you do believe me?
Of course, I believe you.

35
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,853
After the show,
I promise we'll find out
all about it.

36
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,416
Now you lie down
and have a little rest.

37
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,226
You're so good for me.
Five minutes, please.

38
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,528
Put your feet up for a minute
or two. I'll come and see you
before you go on.

39
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,432
Oh, Harry.
I'll send Teresa.

40
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,462
Now, shut your eyes and rest.

41
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,371
Teresa.

42
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,179
Stay with her, won't you.

43
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,153
Is she all right?
Yes.

44
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,682
She saw something, Bill.

45
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,488
My music, Mr. Hunter.
Some of my music is missing.

46
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,691
You don't need it, Rossi.
You know it backwards.

47
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,631
I know, but who could have
done such a thing?

48
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,793
Someone's playing
a joke.

49
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,860
We've had too many jokes.
He's right.

50
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,933
Come on now.
This is a first night,
not a funeral.

51
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,600
Thank you.
Thank you, Bill.

52
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,849


53
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,884


54
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,835
All right, Lattimer,
it's only me.
I thought it was Lord d'Arcy.

55
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,938
He'll come in late,
you know that.

56
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,807
On the first night
of his own opera?

57
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,006
All the more reason for making
a good entrance.

58
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,016
I don't understand it.
I really don't understand it.

59
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,985
Don't you?
I understand it all right.

60
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,887
What I don't understand
is how Ambrose d'Arcy...

61
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,356
can write
so much excellent music
in the last few years...

62
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,949
when he has
so little musical taste.

63
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,426
Thank you, Mr. Hunter.

64
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,627
You're welcome.

65
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,598
A full house, my lord.
So you keep telling me.

66
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,060
They seem to sense
good music, don't they?

67
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,393
Yes.

68
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,073
They like a good tune.

69
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,910
If he wasn't the best producer
in London...

70
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,709
I'm quite sure he meant
no disrespect, my lord.

71

So it is, my lord.

93
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,408
Then why is that box empty
over there?

94
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,650
There have been complaints,
my lord.

95
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,319
Complaints?
Complaints of what?

96
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,681
Of noises, my lord.
What?

97
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,819
Voices.

98
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,488
People do not like
to sit there, my lord.

99
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,995
Are you trying to tell me
it's haunted?

101
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,765

00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,070
Oh no, this is too much.

103
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,276
I shall speak
to your directors
in the morning.

104
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,938
A perfectly good box
going to waste.

105

106
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,124

Of course, I appreciate
that the police
had to be called in.

115
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,800
After all, the criminal
must be apprehended
and punished.

116
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,996
Of course, my lord.

117
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,369
At the same time, Lattimer,
I rely on you to see...

118
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,635
that not one breath of scandal
attaches itself...

119
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,473
either to my name
or to the name of my opera.

120
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,945
I have already
given instructions to
the police to that effect.

121
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,483
The whole affair has been
acutely embarrassing for me.

122
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,712
It's been quite terrible,
you understand?

123
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,980
I doubt if the damage
to my work can
ever really be repaired.

124
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,722
Maria has refused
ever to sing
in this country again.

125
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,559
Heaven knows where
we'll ever find anyone
to take her place.

126
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,692
Mr. Hunter is already
investigating
that possibility, my lord.

127
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:06,204
In what way is
he "investigating
that possibility"?

128
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,332
He is holding auditions
this morning.
Without consulting me?

129
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,173
He said he thought
it would be the best thing.

130
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:16,604
I shall decide what is best
and what is not best
for my opera.

131
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,274
How dare he?

Christine Charles, sir.

152
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,595
You sang that beautifully,
Miss Charles.

153
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,440
I don't think we need to
look any further, do you?

154
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,174
She's a very lovely girl.

155
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,148
She's got
a very lovely voice, too.

156
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,312
Go wait in your dressing room,
Miss Charles.

157
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,583
I'll leave you
to fix the contract, shall I?

158
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,150
She'll need
a bit of coaching, of course.

159
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,251
We should be able to open
in a week or two
with a bit of luck.

Bill, Act 1, Scene 1.

Right. Come along, girls.

162
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,200
Give that to Miss Charles.

163
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,442
That was very good.
Wonderful.

164
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,647
I wish I could sing
like that.

165
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,985
So do I.

166
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,491
I'm sure
you'll get the part.

167
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,858
Absolutely wonderful.

168
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,758
It was marvelous.

169
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,700
Miss Charles.
Yes?

170
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,404
From Lord Ambrose d'Arcy.
Thank you.

171
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,838
I say.
What is it?

172
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,644
What have you got?
Tell us.

173
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,877
I'm to dine with him tonight.

174
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,580
Oh, you lucky girl.
Caviar and champagne!

175
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:10,777
How marvelous.

176
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,618
I've got nothing to wear.

177
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,159
You can borrow my blue.
I'll loan you my green.

178
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,128
You're about my size.
Wardrobe will lend
you something.

179
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,392
This is an occasion.
You must have something new.

180
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,833
But I can't possibly
afford anything.
How much can you afford?

181
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,065
A few shillings,
that's all I have.
Well, I can let you have five.

182
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,198
Oh, no.
I can spare
half a crown.

183
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,299
Me, too.
You mustn't.

184
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,402
You stay here and get ready,
and as soon as we've got
a moment for you...

185
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,970
we'll come and help you
choose it.

186
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,709
But really.
Come on, girls. Good luck.

187
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,751
Congratulations.
Don't worry.

188
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,223
Young woman.

189
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,469
Young woman, listen to me.

190
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,102
Who is that? Who are you?

191
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,937
Be quiet, and listen.

192
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,178
You sang well,
but you will sing better.

193
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,205
I shall teach you.

194
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,646
When you sing,
it will be only for me.

195
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,944
Please, who are you?

196
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,386
Only for me,
do you understand?

197
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,660
I understand what you say,
but...

198
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,858
You are dining
with Ambrose d'Arcy tonight.

199
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:30,028
Be warned,
he is a vile and vicious man.

200
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,669
Who are you?
Where are you hiding?

201
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,229
Please tell me.

202
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,540
I forgot this.

203
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,945
Please, tell me who you are.

204
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,623


205
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,305
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

206
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,276
I believe Lord Ambrose d'Arcy
is expecting me.

207
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,146
Of course.

208
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,524
How charming
you look, my dear.

209
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,502
Shall I serve the champagne,
my lord?
Of course.

210
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,577
It's very pretty here,
isn't it?

211
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,749
I expect you'll have guessed
why I invited you here?

212
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,908
Yes, I think so.

213
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,282
We'll eat a little,
drink a little champagne,
then we'll talk about it.

214
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,398
No, thank you.

215
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,267
I insist.
No, really, thank you.

216
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,137
A brandy, then?

217
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,074
Waiter.

218
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,376
Yes, my lord.

219
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,815
Tell Xavier
we don't want to be disturbed.

220
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,079
Yes, my lord.

221
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,051
Now...

222
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,561
that little matter
we were going to discuss.

223
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,894
About your singing in
my new opera. You guessed it
was that, didn't you?

224
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,831
Yes.
Of course, you did.

225
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,962
You've got a brain in that
pretty little head of yours.

226
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,903
A brain and a voice.

227
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,939
A good singing voice.

228
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,536
Small, mind you,
needs training,
but it's there.

229
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,806
Just wants bringing out,
training.
I know.

230
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,441
Needs a lot of training.

231
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,082
I realize that, of course.
Of course, I'm a busy man.

232
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,682
I think I might be able
to spare you a few minutes
now and then.

233
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,517
Just a few, mind.

234
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,527
If only you could,
I'd be so grateful.

235
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,995
I'd expect you to be grateful.

236
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,060
You're a
delicious little thing.

237
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,100
I'm going to enjoy
teaching you.

238
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,706
I have an idea.

239
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,910
Let's have the
first lesson now, right away.

240
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,907
The theater will be closed.
My apartment won't.

241
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,950
No, I couldn't.
I'm an expert teacher.

242
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,347
No, please.

243
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,189
Do you want to sing
in my new opera or don't you?

244
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,589
You know I do.

245
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,761
Very well, then.

246
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,600
Good evening, Mr. Hunter.
Good evening, Xavier.

247
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,226
Not too late, am I?
No, no, no, no.

248
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,479
Good evening, Ambrose.
Good evening, Harry.

249
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,220
Miss Charles.

250
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,900
Mr. Hunter.

251
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:30,333
Lord Ambrose has very
kindly offered
to coach me in my singing.

252
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,405
Has he?
Tonight.

253
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,972
Tonight?
Yes.

254
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,175
I wondered if you could
possibly spare the time.

255
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,942
That is, if you would care to.

256
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,181
But of course.

257
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:46,023
Nothing I'd like better
than watching Ambrose teaching
you how to sing.

258
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,386
Shall we go?
But, Mr. Hunter.

259
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,021
I've changed my mind, Xavier.
I'm putting on weight.

260
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,025
Ambrose.

261
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,459
It is rather late.

262
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,266
They'll fetch you a cab,
Miss Charles.

263
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,103
No need. She can come with me.

264
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,344
Thank you.

265
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,315
It's a pleasure, believe me.

266
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,409
Miss Charles.

267
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,597
You're not really putting
on weight, are you?

268
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,267
I don't think so.
Then you must be starving.

269
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,133
Please go back,
I can easily find
my own way home.

270
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,005
Have you eaten?
Why, yes.

271
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,907
But did you
actually eat anything?

272
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,737
I was too nervous.

273
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,211
Will you join me
for supper, Miss Charles?

274
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,388
For two this time, Xavier.
Of course, Mr. Hunter.

275
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,356
Thank you for everything.

276
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,834
He must have been furious.

277
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,134
I suppose tomorrow
I shall be back singing
in the chorus again.

278
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,140
If there is a chorus tomorrow.

279
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,611
We've had a strange run
of bad luck with this opera,
Christine.

280
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,617
From the moment
we started rehearsing.

281
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,949
First it was
little, irritating things.

282
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,018
Music disappearing,
costumes torn,
scenery damaged.

283
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,619
Then things got worse,
and finally, last night,
a man was killed on the stage.

284
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,425
The police say...
The police say
it was suicide.

285
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,698
You don't believe that?

286
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:40,336
I think there is
something evil
in this theater, Christine.

287
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:44,931
Something or someone trying
to stop the opera
from ever being performed.

288
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,141
When I was sitting
in my dressing room today...

289
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,543
I thought I heard
a voice speaking to me.

290
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:54,812
Today? When?

291
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,514
Just after I had
the invitation
from Lord Ambrose.

292
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,989
A voice warned me not to go.

293
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,791
He spoke...
He?

294
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,124
Yes, it was a man's voice.
Did you recognize it?

295
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,856
No, I'd never heard it before.

296
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:10,997
He spoke quietly
but very clearly, so that
I could hear every word.

297
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,297
You couldn't see him?
No.

298
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,894
Was it dark?
No.

299
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,736
Perhaps he was hiding
somewhere.
In the wardrobe, a cupboard.

300
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,038
I didn't see him
because he wasn't there.

301
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,775
Were you afraid?

302
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,374
Afraid? No.

303
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,211
Would you go back there
with me?

304
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,652
Now?
Yes.

305
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,622
Yes. L...

306
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,352
Cabbie.

307
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,621
Hello.

308
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,663
Take us to the Opera House.
What, now?

309
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,665
Now.
Well, it's closed.

310
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,701
Yes, I know. Quick as you can.

311
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,633
All right. Come on, girl.

312
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,754
No one ever seems
to lose anything
worth losing nowadays.

313
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,156
No. Like
a nice diamond tiara.

314
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,920
Hello, what have we here?

315
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,865
If you've come to see
the show,
you're a bit late, dearie.

316
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,531
Isn't he handsome.

317
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:18,967
He's lovely.

318
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,937
He's got his girlfriend
with him.

319
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,601
Looking for a nice dark corner
to do a bit of courting,
was you?

320
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,378
Good evening.
My name's Hunter.
I'm the producer of the opera.

321
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,107
Yeah, and
I'm the Queen of England.

322
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,046
Now be off with you
and do your wooing elsewhere.

323
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,244
But I assure you...

324
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,084
Go on. Get out of here.

325
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:44,292
You haven't found a small
diamond brooch, have you?

326
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,887
When did you lose it?
Last night.

327
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,796
Last night?
Where was you sitting?

328
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,459
Stalls.
Front or back?

329
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,666
Front.
That's me.

330
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:56,395
Let me give you a hand, dear.
Keep your
thieving hands away.

331
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,463
It's all mine.

332
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,839
Do you think
it might still be
in the theater?

333
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:04,211
He's right. Come on, girls.

334
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,718
The front stall's mine.
Come back, you thieving lot.

335
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,617
They're mine, I say.

336
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:56,566
Now, can you remember
which direction
this voice came from?

337
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,726
Well, not exactly.

338
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,405
Sit down exactly
just as you were sitting
when you heard it.

339
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,645
You were sitting there
and the voice came from...

340
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,917
The voice came
from somewhere over there.

341
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,687
The gas.

342
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,857
Harry.
Don't be afraid.

343
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,631
Mr. Hunter.

344
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,297
Mr. Hunter. I do not
want you meling...

345
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,568
with something
that does not concern you.

346
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,340
Do you understand?

347
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,135
No, I do not.
Who are you?

348
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,207
Get away from here, get away.

349
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,050
You do not know
what may happen to you.

350
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,618
I'm not easily frightened.

351
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,386
Then you should be.

352
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,815
My threat is not an idle one.

353
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,288
There are forces of evil
at large in the opera tonight.

354
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,591
Leave the girl
and go while you may.

355
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,965
Do you hear me?

356
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,630
Leave the girl here and go.

357
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,078
It's him.
The Phantom.

358
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,207
We saw him.

359
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,350
Harry, look.

360
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,225
It's only the old ratcatcher.
Don't be alarmed.

361
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,769
I won't do you no harm.

362
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,698
Think I must have given
them cleaners a bit of a turn.

363
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:46,036
They're usually gone
by the time I'm around.

364
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,277
I'm the ratcatcher,
you see, sir.

365
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,406
Place is alive with them.

366
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,141
I searches them out
with me lamp...

367
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,087
then I sort
of hypnotizes them...

368
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,819
till I'm near enough
to pounce.

369
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,389
I'm sorry, lady.

370
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,691
I caught a couple of beauties
tonight, sir. Fat.

371
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,264
Like young puppies, they are.
Here, I'll show you.

372
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,298
Now, none of that.

373
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,570
I'll find them
for you in a moment, sir.

374
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,435
You'll never believe
your eyes.
Please stop him.

375
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,667
Please don't bother
on our account.
No?

376
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,540
I could let you have them both
for tuppence, sir.

377
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,739
They'd make a lovely pie,
you know.

378
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,283
We're vegetarians.
Pity.

379
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,551
Here's something
for your trouble, though.
Thank you, sir.

380
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:34,687
Thank you very much, sir.
Well, good night to you then.

381
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,902
Wait here.

382
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,688
Young woman.

383
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:42,317
Young woman,
you must come with me.

384
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,088
It's all right.

385
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,086
I did see him, Harry.

386
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,916
He was standing there
at the top of the stairs.

387
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,790
And he had one eye and a mask?

388
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,429
Yes, all black.

389
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,091
And he stood there staring
and staring at me.

390
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:01,802
It felt as if he was trying
to burn a hole in my brain.

391
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:07,466
The kettle's on and tea
won't be a minute.
How are you feeling, my dear?

392
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,376
She needs to sleep.
Quite.

393
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,711
A nice cup of tea,
then off to bed with you.

394
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,915
You do believe me, Harry.

395
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,287
Yes, I believe you, Christine.

396
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,520


397
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:35,032
Useless. No good at all.

398
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:49,111
For heaven's sake,
get rid of her.

399
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,680
All right, stop.

400
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,753
That's enough. Next please.

401
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:07,227
I should like to sing
Adele's Song from <i>Fledermaus.</i>

402
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,639
Whenever you are ready,
my dear.

403
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,803

422
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,740
Quite excellent.
Needs a little work,
of course.

423
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:26,313
Tell her to come to my office.
Very good, my dear.

424
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,473
Thank you.

425
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,482
Thank you very much.

426
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,251
That's all,
thank you very much.

427
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,993
What' s going on, Ambrose?

428
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,587
I have been endeavoring
to find someone...

429
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:43,395
with the ability to do justice
to the leading role
in my opera, Mr. Hunter.

430
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,935
I thought you'd agreed that
Miss Charles was to sing it.

431
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,698
You may have thought so.

432
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,232
Now, if you'll excuse me.
No.

433
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,276
Have I not made
myself sufficiently clear?

434
00:36:56,214 --> 00:37:00,378
Miss Charles is not to sing
in my opera. Not in the
leading part nor in any other.

435
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,382
She has received
her dismissal this morning.

436
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,618
You small-minded, fatheaded...
Be careful, Mr. Hunter.

437
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,091
Because she refuses
to go to your apartment...

438
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,386
in the mile of the night...
You're dismissed.
You understand?

439
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,930
Now get out of my way.

440
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,970
Sorry, Harry. He made me
send the note round by hand.

441
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,104
I'll go and see her.

442
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,477
If anything else happens,
let me know, will you?

443
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,637
Yes.

444
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,617
No, he can't.

445
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:40,083
It's not fair.
Of course it's not.

446
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,088
If he's stopped me
from playing St. Joan...

447
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,155
Not to let me sing at all,
it just isn't fair.

448
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,864
Fairness isn't one
of his virtues, Christine.

449
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,558
I forgot to ask...

450
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm sorry.

451
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,569
It's all right, Mrs. Tucker.

452
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,672
I thought you'd like a glass
of sherry wine,
but perhaps...

453
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,735
Nothing I'd
like better, Mrs. Tucker.

454
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,669
I'll drink it...

455
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,774
while Miss Charles is
getting ready to come
and have lunch with me.

456
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,319
No, Harry. I couldn't.
Of course you could.

457
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,984
I insist that you come
and celebrate.
Celebrate, Mr. Hunter?

458
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,958
Yes, Mrs. Tucker.
Today, we both got the sack.

459
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,587
Oh, no, Harry.
Oh, yes, Harry.

460
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:23,596
So we've both got nothing
to do and all the time
in the world to do it in.

461
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,431
And I'll allow you just...

462
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,604
ten minutes of it
to get ready.
Not a moment more.

463
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,766
I'll try.

464
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,263


465
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,320
I wonder if you could tell me
where you got this.

466
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,791
Got it? I made it.
You...

467
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,060
Where did you
get this music from?

468
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,325
That's some
of the Professor's.

469
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,898
Professor Petrie. He used to
teach singing at the Academy.

470
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,295
When he remembered
to go there, that is.

471
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,839
He was a little bit...
But very nice.

472
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,307
He used to play the piano
all day long.

473
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,510
I have mostly musicians
stay with me, you know.

474
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,816
He used to play night and day.
I just loved listening to him.

475
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,820
Then the neighbors
started banging on the walls,
so I had to put a stop to it.

476
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:27,380
Do you think it'd be possible
for me to have a closer look
at that music?

477
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,153
Well...
If it's not too much trouble.

478
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:31,660
No, he left a whole pile
of it here.

479
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,863
He left me enough
to paper the house.

480
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,893
But I threw some of it out.

481
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,668
Here's some,
but it's a bit faded now.

482
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,361


483
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,378
I remember that bit.

484
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,219
What became of this Professor,
Mrs. Tucker?

485
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:34,849
He was killed.
Burned to death in a fire.

486
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,751
It was terrible.

487
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,795
A fire?
At a printer's.

488
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,329
He'd gone to see them about
printing his music.

489
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,799
The whole place caught fire
while he was there.

490
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,027
Do you know the name
of this printer's,
Mrs. Tucker?

491
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,073
Let me see. Yes.

492
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,608
It was Piggot's.
By London Bridge.

493
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,237
Ready.

494
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,006
In five minutes exactly.
Good girl.

495
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,781
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Tucker,
for all your help.

496
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,319
What about your sherry...
Of course.

497
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,055
Goodbye, Mrs. Tucker.

498
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,091
The fire, sir.
That would be a bit
before my time.

499
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:20,229
Perhaps you would care
to see our Mr. Weaver, sir?
He's the master printer.

500
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,296
He's been here
a very long time.
Yes, I'd like that very much.

501
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,069
I'll see
if he's available, sir.

502
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:30,011
What is this, Harry?

503
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,579
It's a long story.
I'll tell you over lunch.

504
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:38,446
Mr. Weaver?
You were enquiring
about the fire, sir?

505
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:41,958
Yes, well, rather
about someone
who died in the fire.

506
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,817
No one died.

507
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,488
But I understood that someone
was burned to death
in the fire.

508
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,767
Someone was badly burned, sir.
But he didn't die.

509
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,527
Not here, anyway.

510
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,500
What happened?

511
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,674
He broke in one night, sir.

512
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,409
He must have knocked over
a lamp or something...

513
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,408
and put
the whole place ablaze.

514
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,345
He tried to put it out with...

515
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,884
what he thought
was water, sir.

516
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,586
But it was some of this.

517
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,520
For etching the plates.

518
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,121
He threw a whole jarful
at the flames.

519
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,385
Some of it splashed back
in his face.

520
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,502
Nitric acid, sir.

521
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,402
What became of him?

522
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:35,642
He ran out screaming.
No one ever saw
any more of him.

523
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,539
And you've no idea
who he was?
No, sir.

524
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,819
Nor why he broke in?
He was a burglar.

525
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,750
I suppose, sir.

526
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,758
Thank you very much
for seeing us, Sergeant.

527
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,659
I'm sure
you must be very busy.
It is quite all right, sir.

528
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,959
I'm enquiring about a fire.
A fire, sir?

529
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,428
At Piggot's, the printers.
Do you remember it?

530
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,192
I remember it well, sir.
I was on duty. Saw it all.

531
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,469
There was a man badly burned.
There was indeed, sir.

532
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:06,536
He came running out
of that place
screaming blue murder...

533
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,271
if you'll
pardon the expression, Miss.

534
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,337
Where did he run to?
Straight up the street
and into the river.

535
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,007
The river?
That's right, Miss.

536
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,812
Straight in, he went.

537
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,077
About here.

538
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,796
So that's where he went.

539
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:32,094
Who, Harry?
Who is this mystery man?
I'll tell you over lunch.

540
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,371
Lunch? It's almost three.

541
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,464
Is it? Well, tea then.

542
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,906
We'll have tea in the park,
then a row on the lake...

543
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,616
and dinner at Frascati's.

544
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,048
And then perhaps
we'll have some supper.

545
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,775
The cab's stopped.

546
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,401
Has it?

547
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,607
Well, tell him to go round
the park again.

548
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:25,815
Harry, we can't.
He's been round
four times already.

549
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,157
Well, perhaps he likes it.

550
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,871
Cabbie, would you mind
taking us round
the park again?

551
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:46,341
Well, sir, being
a pleasant enough evening
for myself...

552
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,809
I wouldn't mind a bit.

553
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:51,279
I don't suppose
old Lightning here
would grumble much either.

554
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,578
But, me missus...

555
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,613
Me missus
has a nervous disposition.

556
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,087
She don't like being left
on her own at nighttime.
She don't.

557
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,318
So, if you wouldn't mind, sir.

558
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,189
I understand perfectly.
Thought you would, sir.

559
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,500
Looks like I'll have
to take you home.

560
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,959
Thank you for a lovely day.

561
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,764
The first of many,
I wouldn't wonder, Miss, eh?

562
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,905
I think I'll just go
and inspect the harness, sir.

563
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,256
All in order, sir.

564
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,990
All in order, sir,
with the harness.

565
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:43,927
Yes, I'll just
climb aboard again.

566
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,577
Harry, you never did tell me
about that mystery man,
you know.

567
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,143
It's quite simple.

568
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:04,681
I found out how Ambrose d'Arcy
managed to write
such good music.

569
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:08,190
He didn't.
Someone else wrote it for him.

570
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,785
Are you sure?
Near enough.

571
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,431
What are you going to do?
Nothing.

572
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,257
The real composer's dead.

573
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,799
We've enough trouble
without making more.

574
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,975
All right then, sir?
Very all right, thank you.

575
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,277
All right. We're away then.

576
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,417
Come on, Lightning.
We'll soon be home now.

577
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,194


578
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,384


579
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:41,427
I am going to teach you
to sing, Christine.

580
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,507
I am going to give you
a new voice.

581
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,141
A voice so wonderful...

582
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,842
that the theaters all over
the world will be filled
with your admirers.

583
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:58,020
You will be the greatest star
the opera has ever known.

584
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,318
Greater than the greatest.

585
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,787
And when you sing,
Christine...

586
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,160
you will be singing only...

587
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:12,630
for me.

588
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:21,538
d <i>Most noble Lord Dauphin</i> d

589
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,071
d <i>I am sent by God</i> d

590
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:28,751
d <i>to bring succor</i>
<i>to your Kingdom</i> 

591
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,355
No, not like that.

592
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:34,685
Now start again.

593
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,422


594
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:47,594
d <i>Most noble Lord Dauphin</i> d

595
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,829
d <i>I am sent by God</i> d

596
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:54,605
d <i>to bring succor</i>
<i>to your Kingdom</i> 

597
00:51:56,379 --> 00:52:00,145
If you watch me carefully,
my dear,
I'll give you your cue.

598
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,548
Just one moment, Mr. Rossi.

599
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:05,918
I am taking this rehearsal.

600
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:09,654
When I require any help
from you, I shall ask for it.

601
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:13,786
Then you had better ask
for it now because
you most certainly need it.

602
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,365
What did you say?

603
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,025


604
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,500
Stop it, stop it I say!

605
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:24,901
You're dismissed.

606
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,313
Good morning, gentlemen.

607
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,055
What are they playing at?
Stop them.

608
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:44,390
Stop. Where are you going?
Stop, I say.

609
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,593
You're dismissed.

610
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,655
They're all dismissed.

611
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,024
You, too.

612
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:55,364
And you.
You come to my office.
At once.

613
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,745
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.

614
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,677
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.

615
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,450
What's happening, Bill?
We've all been dismissed.

616
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,009
What? You, too?
Yes, and I can't say
I'm sorry.

617
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,749
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.

618
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:16,251
How could they do this to me?

619
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,594
My first opera
and I'm let down
on every side.

620
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,163
First, I'm haunted by ghosts,
and now all this.

621
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,098
It really is too much.

622
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,969
Well, say something.
What am I going to do?

623
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:34,136
I think you should ask
Mr. Hunter to come back.

624
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:38,670
What? What did you say?

625
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:42,214
I think you should apologize
to Mr. Hunter
and ask him to come back.

626
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,616
How dare you?

627
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,411
I dare because as manager
of this opera house...

628
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:48,957
I am responsible
to my director
for its welfare.

629
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:52,984
And if I allow you to carry on
in this manner,
we shall all be made bankrupt.

630
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,590
I refuse to stay and listen
to this treason.
Very well.

631
00:53:56,933 --> 00:54:01,199
But if you go, I shall take it
upon myself to ask
Mr. Hunter to return.

632
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,236
Well done, Lattimer.

633
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,512
I think, I feel quite...

634
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:12,872
Brandy. Where do you keep it?

635
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:15,851
I don't know how I dared.

636
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,053
I'll never forget
the expression on his face.

637
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,863
Mr. Hunter, what have I done?

638
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,297
You've proved that
you're a man and not a mouse.

639
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,733
You've also persuaded me
to come back and help you
clear up this mess.

640
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,235
Will you? Will you really?

641
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:39,502
I'll just join you in one of
these to celebrate, then we'll
get down to work, shall we?

642
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,371
Thank you, gentlemen,
thank you.

643
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,406
Would you two change places?

644
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:46,804
That's good.

645
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:50,448
Would you come forward
a few paces, please?
Thank you.

646
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,853
I am sorry, ladies
and gentlemen, I shall have
to leave for a few minutes.

647
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:00,418
I hope I won't be very long.

648
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,692
Carry on, Bill.
Harry.

649
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:10,298
Right, we'll go
from the opening scene.

650
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:13,274
Her bed hasn't been slept in,
but she must
have gone up there...

651
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,436
because her coat was hanging
in the wardrobe...

652
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,709
and the window was wide open,
and I never leave
the window wide open...

653
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,344
because you know why.

654
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:23,651
She can't have left
very early, can she,
without your knowing?

655
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,711
I'm up at 5:30 every morning.

656
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:29,020
I don't sleep very well
at the best of times.
Wind, you know.

657
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,117
I'm terribly troubled
with the wind.

658
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:35,155
Just as soon as she does
return, perhaps you could ask
her to come to the theater.

659
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,994
I shall tell her at once,
Mr. Hunter.

660
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,399
I just can't think
what could have
happened to her.

661
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:40,964


662
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:42,834


663
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,307
Better. Again.

664
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:50,777


665
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,210
Better. Again.

666
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,043


667
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,473


668
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,444
I can't.

669
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:31,950
You little fool.

670
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,588
Do you think you can become
a great singer
without suffering?

671
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:42,019
Do you think
I have not suffered?

672
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,389
The scoundrel.

673
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:50,833
But sir, there is 10 years'
work there. 10 years
of my life. Surely 50 is...

674
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:55,407
I'm sorry, I accept.

675
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,509
Thank you. Thank you.

676
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,960
Sing! Use that wonderful gift
that God has given you.

677
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,383


678
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,251


679
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:52,996
Good. Now the melody.

680
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,871


681
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,247
Listen carefully
to the phrasing.

682
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,185
You begin very quietly.

683
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,588
Then build.
Keep the tone spinning.

684
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,992
Build your voice
until the auditorium
is filled...

685
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,935
with the beautiful sound
of it.

686
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:43,650
How can you be sure
that he died? That's what
I want to know.

687
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:44,777
What makes you sure?

688
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,379
Current's very fast here.
He'd never have
stood a chance.

689
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:48,754
That's why we're sure.

690
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:51,487
Did you drag the river?
Well, did you?

691
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:56,065
I've just said the river runs
very fast, sir. What would
have been the good?

692
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:00,399
Now, I've got work to do, sir,
even if you haven't.

693
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,665
All right, Sergeant.
Well, thank you anyway.

694
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:38,329


695
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:08,260
Water.

696
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,686
Now, this time sing properly.
Do you understand?

697
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,925
Use your voice,
do you understand?

698
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:39,695
Use your voice from here.

699
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:43,902


700
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:48,301
Let her sleep.

701
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:55,332
What was that?

702
01:01:55,845 --> 01:02:00,805
Scoundrel, it's my music.
It's my music. It's my...

703
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,208


704
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,751


705
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,910
Here, Professor Petrie.
You'd better take him.

706
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:53,786
Did he harm you?
No.

707
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:02,263
How do you know my name?

708
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,266
I know who you are, Professor,
because I made it my business
to find out.

709
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,142
I also know something else
about you.

710
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,806
The opera we've been
rehearsing was composed
by you, wasn't it?

711
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,718
Yes, that is true.

712
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:32,652
You took it to Ambrose d'Arcy
for help in getting it
published, didn't you?

713
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,533
What happened?
What happened?

714
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:46,066
I took him all of my music.

715
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,840
?50, no more.

716
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:54,981
But there is 10 years'
work there. Ten years
of my life, sir.

717
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,645
Surely ?50 is...

718
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,277
Am I not correct
in thinking that...

719
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:01,721
you have never
had any of your work
published, Professor...

720
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:04,148
Petrie?

721
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,661
Not, not yet, but...
So you are completely unknown.

722
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:10,629
Of course, but everybody...

723
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,429
There are
many unknown composers...

724
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:15,095
who'd be only too glad
to have
their works published...

725
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,900
without any fee at all.

726
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,398
Come, I'm a busy man.

727
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,467
No.

728
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:26,207
There's a full symphony here,
sir, and two quartets...

729
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,977
and a concerto for viola.

730
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:32,752
And an opera, sir,
a new opera, complete.

731
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,519
I'm sorry.

732
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:44,621
I accept.

733
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,528
Come in tomorrow
and the papers
will be ready to sign.

734
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,768
It is embarrassing for me
to have to ask this...

735
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,537
but perhaps
you could manage...
What?

736
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,511
I owe my landlady quite a sum.
A small advance, perhaps.

737
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,609
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.

738
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:07,513
Thank you.

739
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:09,575
Look at it. Look at it, man.

740
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,015
Filthy.
Yes, my lord.

741
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,023
Do you expect me to be seen
driving in that?

742
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,115
No, my lord.

743
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:17,557
Do it again.
Yes, my lord.

744
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:19,890
Have it ready
by this evening.
Yes, my lord.

745
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:26,058
Lord Ambrose. Please excuse
this intrusion,
but I must see you.

746
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,100
They said
I should find you here.

747
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,333
My music...
Tomorrow.

748
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,073
Tomorrow may be too late.
They're printing
my music with...

749
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:36,111
I think you mean
my music, don't you?

750
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:38,441
I don't understand.

751
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:42,473
I bought it
from you, remember?
Yes, to publish, yes.

752
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,542
But they're printing your name
on the cover.

753
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,420
My name on my music.
Is that so surprising?

754
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:52,922
You can't mean it.
If you'll kindly excuse me.

755
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,895
You thief. Scoundrel.

756
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,126
Cabbie, go.

757
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:18,441
It's my music.

758
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:44,354
Who he is, I do not know...

759
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,660
and as he cannot speak,
I shall never know.

760
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:52,590
Sometimes he's uncontrollable,
like a wild animal.

761
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,694
But he has saved my life...

762
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:59,169
and has looked after me
ever since.

763
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:02,037
And you've lived down here
all these years?

764
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,012
And I shall die down here.

765
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:10,014
Look, I am dying already.

766
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,648
But before I go...

767
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:18,522
I implore you,
allow me to finish one thing.

768
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:26,491
Let me teach you to use
that wonderful voice
that God has given you.

769
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,466
Then you may never
see me again...

770
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:32,507
but you will never forget.

771
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,140
Please, give me a little time.

772
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:39,610
A month, two weeks.

773
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,946
One week even.
One week,
and I will work a miracle.

774
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:48,312
She will sing for me
as she has never sung before.

775
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:52,854
And I will hear
my work performed.

776
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:00,857
Please.

777
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:09,344

What the devil?

What is this foolery?
Who are you?

785

Answer me, who are you?

Good evening, Lord Ambrose.

787

Take off that ridiculous mask

788

Do you hear me? Take it off.
