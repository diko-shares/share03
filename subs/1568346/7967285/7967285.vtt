In his business, that's an asset.

Well, there's less in his asset

136
00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:45.190
He's had a longstanding sexual relationship

with his co-editor of the magazine.
It wrecked his marriage but not hers.

138

You used to run one of the largest

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.206

231
00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:45.109
I'm not obsessed by the
declining health of the company.

joining the Nationalist Socialist

and their son, Gottfried.

261

Now, Gottfried, Harriet's father,

262
00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:39.023
was what they used to call a good-time Charlie.

263

- They still call them that.
- Do they? Okay.

264
00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:44.362
He was a charmer, a ladies' man and a drunk.

265
00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:47.498
In other words, a born salesman.
Which he did for the company,

266
00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:50.368
traveling around and taking
clients out to dinner.

267
00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:52.870
- Well, somebody's gotta do it.
- That's right.

268
00:17:52.871 --> 00:17:56.040
Anyway, ahem, he died in 1965.

269
00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:58.209
Drowned, drunk, here on the island.

270
00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.780
His wife, Isabella, who had been
pretty much useless as a parent before,

271
00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:05.349
became even more so after his death,

272
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.186

No. The currents aren't strong here.
Anything that falls in the water turns up.

332
00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:14.672
Like her father.

333
00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:17.241
His body didn't drift more than 10 meters

334
00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:19.810

335
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:23.114
Oh, no. Someone killed her.

336
00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.916
Someone on the island that day.

337
00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:28.085
Someone close enough to know

338
00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:33.805
what she used to give me
each year on my birthday.

339
00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:37.094
Those are from her.

340
00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:41.881
And the rest, from her killer.

341
00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:54.912
Who knows about these?

342
00:21:54.913 --> 00:21:58.783
There's me, the police, the killer,

343
00:21:58.784 --> 00:22:01.123

346

I understand your frustration,

348
00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:24.141

349
00:22:24.142 --> 00:22:27.445
- But we haven't discussed your fee.
- We don't need to.

350

You don't know that. You have
a very keen investigative mind.

353
00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:38.956
Here's what I propose:

354
00:22:38.957 --> 00:22:40.858
You come stay on the island.

355
00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:44.228
I have a nice little cottage
by the water you can use.

356
00:22:44.229 --> 00:22:46.330
You study the material I send you.

357
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:48.733
You find something I've missed or you don't.

358
00:22:48.734 --> 00:22:52.002
What you're asking me to do is set
aside my life and career for...

359
00:22:52.003 --> 00:22:54.205
Think of this as a well-deserved holiday.

360
00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:58.909
A way of avoiding all those people
that you might want to avoid right now.

361
00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.612
As for compensation, I'll
pay you double your salary

362
00:23:01.613 --> 00:23:03.514
for as many months as it takes.

363
00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:06.484
- Quadruple it if you solve the mystery.
- Herr Vanger...

364
00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:08.786
I'm not done. I will throw in one more thing,

365
00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:11.155
even though you're a terrible negotiator.

366
00:23:11.156 --> 00:23:13.891
It's something you want more than anything else,

367
00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:18.062

370
00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:28.172

- You fired you.

380

Wennerström wants to see me wave
a white flag, not a red flag.

381
00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:28.833
If it looks like there's a problem
between us, it'll satisfy him.

382
00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:30.401
There is a problem between us.

383
00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:33.604
He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down.

384
00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:38.823
- You're leaving me to fight him alone.
- It's four hours by train.

<i>MORELL: The fact that I never
found a body was not surprising.</i>

489
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:31.174
<i>You can't dig up an entire island.</i>

490
00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:33.543
But neither could I find the motive.

491
00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:36.380
Was it spontaneous? Was it calculated?

492
00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:38.915
Did she know something
someone wished she didn't?

493
00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:42.652
- Was it about business?
- Business? Well, she was 16.

494
00:33:42.653 --> 00:33:44.554
And very bright.

495
00:33:44.555 --> 00:33:47.457
Henrik told me and many
others he could easily see her

496
00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:49.693
running the company one day.

497
00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:52.529
She was with some friends that day at a parade.

498
00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.400
She told them she was feeling
unwell. She left early.

499
00:33:56.401 --> 00:34:00.237
But they also told me she
kept secrets from them too.

500
00:34:00.238 --> 00:34:03.840
The main thing I learned was that
teenage girls are complicated.

501
00:34:03.841 --> 00:34:06.410
- I have one.
- Oh, then you know.

502
00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:09.679
I wanted to, uh, ahem,

503
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.759
ask you about this.

504
00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:18.060
She received that from
Henrik the Christmas before.

505
00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:23.508
I've studied it more times than I can say.

506
00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:25.095
I know every page of it.

507
00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:27.597
- It's the last page I was curious about.
- As was I.

508
00:34:27.598 --> 00:34:31.701
It's a list of names, numbers and
it must have some significance.

509
00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:33.336
All local phone numbers.

510
00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:35.772
The first belonged to a woman, Margot,

511
00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:38.875
whose mother was Magda,
who denied knowing Harriet.

512
00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:42.079
The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosmarie Larsson,

513
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.116
an elderly woman who died some years before.

514
00:34:46.117 --> 00:34:51.121
The other three were not connected
in any way that I could find.

515
00:34:51.122 --> 00:34:54.558
I reminded you of things you'd
rather forget, and I'm sorry.

516
00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:57.877
I can't forget.

517
00:34:57.929 --> 00:35:00.497
It's my Rebecka case.

518
00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:02.599
Uh, I don't know what that is.

519
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:08.071
Every policeman has at least one
unsolved case to obsess over.

520
00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:10.707
Back then we had an Officer Torstensson.

521
00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:13.743
Year after year, he kept going
back to this Rebecka case.

522
00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:17.147
Taking out the files,
studying them over and over.

523
00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:19.382
We were young. We laughed at him.

524
00:35:19.383 --> 00:35:21.485
And that was also a missing-girl case?

525
00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:24.421
No, no, no, that's not why I mention it.

526
00:35:24.422 --> 00:35:27.858
I'm talking about the soul of a policeman.

527
00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:30.927
<i>MORELL: Poor old Torstensson never solved it.</i>

528
00:35:30.928 --> 00:35:34.431
<i>And he never let it go.</i>

529
00:35:34.432 --> 00:35:38.307
<font color=#ff00ff>[TRAIN HORN BLARING]</font>

530
00:35:40.438 --> 00:35:42.906
<font color=#FF551>MAN:</font> So how's Mr. Palmgren doing?

531
00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:45.876
I heard he had a stroke of some kind? Huh?

532
00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:48.245
It's terrible.

533
00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:51.314
Now, what exactly do you do
at this security company?

534
00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:53.250
Make coffee, sort mail.

535
00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:55.452
But not full-time.

536
00:35:55.453 --> 00:35:57.287
Not even part-time consistently.

537
00:35:57.288 --> 00:36:03.575
They somehow got along without
coffee or mail in July and August?

538
00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:10.408
- How much do you make there?
- Enough.

539
00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.102
How much is your rent?

540
00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:14.920
I pay my rent.

541
00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:19.242
And when was the last time you were late?

542
00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:21.545
Never.

543
00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:26.332
You think that thing through your
eyebrow makes you attractive?

544
00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:29.759
Here's the problem.

545
00:36:30.154 --> 00:36:33.256
There's a discrepancy between the obligation

546
00:36:33.257 --> 00:36:37.561
of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and
the management of your finances.

547
00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:40.964
There's no discrepancy. It was clear
I could manage my own finances.

548
00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:42.265
That is not clear to me.

549
00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:44.634
- I'm not a child.
- You are not. But you were.

550
00:36:44.635 --> 00:36:46.937
And between then and now, you were committed

551
00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:49.940
to the locked ward of St.
Stefan's where you continued

552
00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:52.776
to display violent aggression.

553
00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:55.645
And you failed to adapt to four foster homes,

554
00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:59.115
arrested twice for intoxication,
twice for narcotics,

555
00:36:59.116 --> 00:37:03.353
again for assault, smashing
a bottle into a man's face.

556
00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:05.822
And it's not even that long ago.

557
00:37:05.823 --> 00:37:10.293
You may have conned Mr. Palmgren
into thinking that you have changed,

558
00:37:10.294 --> 00:37:12.295
but when I'm looking at this,

559
00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:16.433
not to mention the way you're looking at me now,

560
00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:18.702
I don't think you have.

561
00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:21.538
So the good old Mr. Palmgren days are over.

562
00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:24.708
Starting now, you will be
given a monthly allowance.

563
00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:27.143
You'll provide me with
receipts for your expenses.

564
00:37:27.144 --> 00:37:30.547
If the numbers don't balance, I assume
the difference is going to drugs.

565
00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:32.582
I've taken care of myself since I was 10.

566
00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:34.217
The state has taken care of you.

567
00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:37.087
Miss Salander, please, look
at me, this is important.

568
00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:40.624
Since your behavior is
elaborately documented in here,

569
00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:43.326
it will shock no one if I chose an alternative

570
00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:48.044
to the very lenient arrangement
I have just outlined.

571
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.646
Would you prefer institutionalization?

Oh, good, thank you.

578
00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:32.175
I found him at death's
door, halfway up the hill.

579
00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:35.211
- I'm afraid I'm a little out of shape.
- It's a climb for anyone.

<font color=#FF551>- MIKAEL:</font> Thank you, Martin.

<font color=#FF551>- LIV:</font> Mmm. Martin? Smells wonderful.
<font color=#FF551>- MARTIN:</font> No. Leave your shoes on.

585
00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:51.061
I used to work in the company's
petrochemical division in Göteborg.

586
00:38:51.062 --> 00:38:52.796
When it was sold, I went with it.

587
00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:54.431
A dark day.

back to Stockholm for family events.

And I drive up to spend a
couple of days with Martin.

590

- You don't?
- Yes, I do.

602
00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:40.643

it, but it can't be swept under the rug.

- What can't?
- Harriet.

We can talk about it later.

Uh... We can talk about it now.

- That's one reason.

608

<font color=#FF551>MARTIN:</font> I don't want to
read about that in the book.

609
00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:57.260
Everything else is fine. Harriet certainly.

610
00:39:57.261 --> 00:40:01.030
You know, everything changed after that.

611
00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:03.533
Not just the family, but the company as well.

612
00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:05.769
- How so?
- We're not Ericsson or Nordea.

613
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:09.539
But we're still the largest
family-owned company in the country.

614
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.841
At our height we had 40,000 employees.

615
00:40:11.842 --> 00:40:13.243
We have half of that now.

616
00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:17.313

after my sister's death.

618
00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:24.387

and his heart.

Searching, not finding. Even worse.

626

This event, Mikael, it has to
have a big part in your book.

<font color=#ff00ff>[MARTIN SPEAKS IN SWEDISH]</font>

628

No, thank you.

We are all uncomfortable with the
idea of a chronicle of our family.

It's not about the family. It's about
Henrik and the company.

638
00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:54.543
Like I said.

639
00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:58.007
It's not my intention to present
a malicious portrait of anyone.

Unlike that one, yes.

642

So you're not really here to find
out what happened to Harriet.

643
00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:10.653
I can't ignore such a dramatic event,
but, no, that's by no means my focus.

644
00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:12.789
Those boxes that Gunnar carted down here,

645
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:17.527
which are where, in the closet now?
Those weren't Henrik's investigation?

646
00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:23.066
I wonder sometimes who's crazier,
my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.

647
00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:24.867
Since we're talking about her,

648
00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:27.170
since you brought her up, what was she like?

649
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.504
What was Harriet like?

650
00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:31.341
- I'm sure Henrik has told you.

really going on with a teenager.

My sister Anita was closer to her in age.

654

anyone. You should talk to her.

655

- I'd love to. Where is she?
- If I had to guess, London.

We never really got along.

658

- She hates this place more than I do.

659
00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:56.499
She left. Moved to London, that was it.

660

I'm sorry, I don't understand.

712
00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:59.936
I'm writing a biography of your
Uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here.

713
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:02.305
I haven't seen him in over 20 years.

714

Actually, it's a lot more than that.

715
00:49:04.741 --> 00:49:07.910
Haven't seen my sister, haven't
seen anyone in that family.

716
00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:11.247
Most of what I'm writing about predates that,

717
00:49:11.248 --> 00:49:13.382
so your recollections are valid.

718
00:49:13.383 --> 00:49:16.419
I wouldn't know where to
start, if that was a question.

719
00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:19.555
Well, then let me narrow it down.
I've gotten up to the 1960s,

720
00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:23.326
to the event that, you know,
changed everything in Henrik's life.

721
00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:26.008
Harriet.

722
00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:32.101
Um, everything that I know about
that, I told to whatever his name was.

723
00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:33.336
Morell.

724
00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:35.371
My recollections were a lot better then.

725
00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:38.607
I'm not really speaking about the event itself.

726
00:49:38.608 --> 00:49:42.912
I just want to get a clearer
sense of what Harriet was like.

727
00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:47.426
She was very messed up.

728
00:49:47.884 --> 00:49:51.287
Well, just like all us
Vanger kids, really, but...

729
00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:53.556
Crazy mother.

730
00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:55.658
Drunken father.

731
00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.426
At least her father wasn't a Nazi.

732
00:49:57.427 --> 00:49:59.295
- Was he abusive?
- Mine?

733
00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:00.830
No, hers.

734
00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:06.811
Not that I ever saw, but you could
tell that something was going on.

735
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:11.073
Some days she'd be very withdrawn.

736
00:50:11.074 --> 00:50:14.110
And then the next minute
she'd be putting on makeup

737
00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:18.047
and wearing the tightest
sweater that she had to school.

738
00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:21.650
And then she'd be studying her Bible like a nun.

739
00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:25.154
No Vanger was ever religious. Can you imagine?

740
00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:29.099
She was obviously very unhappy.

741
00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:33.329
- What do you think happened to her?
- Everyone knows what.

742
00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:36.432
You don't have any thoughts about who or why?

743
00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:40.403
All that I know is that I
felt really sorry for her.

744
00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:44.106
I got away when I was 18 and I never went back.

745
00:50:44.107 --> 00:50:47.009
And she'd have done the same.

746
00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:49.412
But she never made it to 18.

<font color=#FF551>VANGER:</font> I used to be in the newspaper business.

815
00:58:04.814 --> 00:58:06.949
We owned six dailies back in the '50s.

816
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:09.284
<i>We still own one. The Courier, here in town.</i>

817
00:58:09.285 --> 00:58:13.789
Which I let my nephew, Birger, run,
because he can't run anything else.

818
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:17.540
So, what would you say to taking on a partner?

819
00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:22.097
Well, we've never had to consider it before.

820
00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:23.899
We value our independence very much.

821
00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:26.635
Independence in publishing
is dependent on advertisers.

822
00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:30.205
However much you have, you retain.
We don't care about content.

823
00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:33.509
Excuse me. Did I miss something?

824
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:35.310
Talking about investing in the magazine.

825
00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:39.381
- I gathered that. But why?
- Not out of greed, that's for sure.

826
00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:43.819
I feel badly that I've taken Mikael away
from you at the worst possible time.

827
00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:49.258
But now I am convinced that this is
the right thing to do. The moral thing.

828
00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:52.861
That's one reason. And, um...

829
00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:54.563
And?

830
00:58:54.564 --> 00:58:57.799
The enemies of my friends are my enemies.

831
00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.235
<font color=#FF551>MIKAEL:</font> How long have you been
discussing this with them?

832
00:59:00.236 --> 00:59:03.038
I haven't. They called yesterday
and asked me to come up.

833
00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:05.407
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You live in the woods.

834
00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:07.543
I deserve to be treated like an idiot?

835
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:10.646
I wanted to hear what they had to say.

836
00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:12.581
You would've said no before they could.

837
00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:14.750
Well, I'm saying it now. It's a bad idea.

838
00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:18.186
You heard me tell them we
had six months. I lied.

839
00:59:18.187 --> 00:59:20.289
We will be out of business in three.

840
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:23.191
But you don't know this family
like I do. They're crazy.

841
00:59:23.192 --> 00:59:24.660
We're not marrying into it.

842
00:59:24.661 --> 00:59:27.930
If we do this, that's exactly what we're doing.

843
00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:30.432
So you wanna say no, let's say no.

844
00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:35.742
Instead of 50 percent of something,
let's own 100 percent of nothing.

845
00:59:39.609 --> 00:59:41.209
- Mikael?
- What?

846
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:43.745
I'm leaving this godforsaken
island in the morning.

847
00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:47.929
- So?
- So are you coming to bed or not?

He rubbed his arm, then he collapsed.

01:13:08.183 --> 01:13:10.451
So how is he?

1003
01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:13.454
Well, the good news is he survived.

1004

How he does now, we'll have to see.

1005
01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:18.960
- He's in intensive care.
- Right.

1006
01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:20.762
Oh, uh...

1007
01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:23.264
May I have one of those? You want a sandwich?

1009

Thank you.

1010
01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:35.977
Um, I hate to be indelicate,
but Henrik promised me something

1011
01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:38.379
- when I agreed to do this.
- Yeah, Wennerström.

1012
01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.516
I need to know what he has
on him. Now. In case, um...

1013
01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:43.117
In case he dies?

1014
01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:46.120
- Well, that is indelicate.
- And I apologize.

1015
01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:48.823
I don't know what he has on
him, if you're asking me.

1016
01:13:48.824 --> 01:13:53.861
And he can't tell you in
the condition he's in, so...

1017
01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:58.032
We also didn't discuss who I'd report
to if something should happen to him.

1018
01:13:58.033 --> 01:14:00.668
Oh, well, you'd report to me, of course.

1019
01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:04.872
But we both know that nothing's
going to come of this, don't we?

1020
01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:09.477
- No. No, we don't know that.
- What do you mean?

1021
01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:12.613
- I may have found something.
- You're joking.

1022
01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:14.749
What have you found?

1023
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:18.386
The last time I reported on something
without being absolutely sure,

1024
01:14:18.387 --> 01:14:20.755
I lost my life savings.

1025
01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:23.524
I need a research assistant.
Can you authorize that?

1026
01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:26.894
Yes. Do you have one in mind?

1027
01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:29.197
- I can find someone.
- I know an excellent one.

1028
01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:31.032
She did the background check on you.

1029
01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:32.233
The what?

1030
01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:34.969
Well, you don't think we can hire just anyone

1031
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:37.839
without doing a background check.

1032
01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.774
I want to read that.

1033
01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:43.010
Herr Frode was kind enough
to share your report with me.

1034
01:14:43.011 --> 01:14:46.347
The investigator's name. That is her name, yes?

1035
01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:50.751
See, I can't find any record of
her, and I'm pretty good at that.

1036
01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:54.155
- Would it matter what her name is?
- If I wanted to speak to her, yes.

1037
01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:56.324
- It's against policy.
- You sure?

1038
01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.559
Just like your sources. You understand.

1039
01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.695
Okay. Ahem.

1040
01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:03.164
Here's a name for you.

1041
01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:04.432
My sister.

1042
01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:06.200
She's also my lawyer.

1043
01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:07.768
She'll be contacting you.

1044
01:15:07.769 --> 01:15:12.748
There are things in here that can
only have come from one place.

1045
01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:18.880
The reason you can find no record of
her is because her records are sealed.

1046
01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:23.384
- She's a ward of the state.
- What's that gotta do with anything?

1047
01:15:23.385 --> 01:15:26.259
She's had a rough life.

1048
01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:30.630
Can we please not make it any rougher?

Your report, very detailed.

Uh, your boss, Armansky,

1079
01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:44.952
yeah, he tells me you only
do jobs that interest you,

1080
01:18:44.953 --> 01:18:48.222
so I suppose I should be flattered.

1081

You gonna sit down?

1082
01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:56.764
He also says that you're the one he
goes to when the job is, um, sensitive.

1083
01:18:56.765 --> 01:19:00.868
That's the word he used,
"sensitive." I'm gonna use "illegal,"

1084
01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:04.171
because that's what it was when
you hacked into my computer.

1085
01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:07.274
No, I'm not gonna do anything
about that. I could, but I won't.

1086
01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:10.077
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tell you a story,

1087
01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:14.014
and if it entertains you, maybe you'll
decide to help me research further.

or how they're connected

girl, but they must be somehow.

1096

they are, what happened to them,

How exactly was she killed?

1115

- Miss?
- Salander.

1116
01:22:00.281 --> 01:22:04.284
Miss Salander. I hope you don't mind
me asking, but when did you last eat?

1117
01:22:04.285 --> 01:22:06.953
I have a high metabolism. I can't put on weight.

1118
01:22:06.954 --> 01:22:11.724
I'm asking because it is better to
look at what I am about to show you

1119
01:22:11.725 --> 01:22:14.406

1124
01:22:33.814 --> 01:22:35.882
- How is he?
- He needs surgery,

1125
01:22:35.883 --> 01:22:39.786
but there's no DNR in place. So
it's up to the family to decide,

1126
01:22:39.787 --> 01:22:43.156
should the occasion arise,
whether to resuscitate or not.

1127
01:22:43.157 --> 01:22:46.092
And they're not good at decisions.

1128

So how was it with Miss Salander?

1129
01:22:47.828 --> 01:22:51.030

I might be able to see him?

I looked, but let me check.

- Don't check.

1132

We all know what Henrik
wants. Can we just do that?

1137
01:23:08.949 --> 01:23:12.585
Henrik is fighting for his life in
there. This is the last thing he needs.

1138
01:23:12.586 --> 01:23:16.564
Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger,

It has nothing to do with you.
It's between her and Henrik.

1155
01:24:14.915 --> 01:24:19.152
She lost it when my father died,
and her drinking and her...

1156
01:24:19.153 --> 01:24:23.156
Got so bad Henrik took me
and my sister away from her

1157

1159
01:24:28.662 --> 01:24:31.502
She hasn't forgiven him.

1160
01:24:32.433 --> 01:24:34.667
You must stay.

1161

You're the last chance Henrik
has at some kind of resolution.

Everyone in town knows who and where you are.

1176
01:25:25.986 --> 01:25:29.055
That's comforting. Are you
hungry? I can make you a sandwich.

01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:37.997
The five cases from Harriet's list.

1182
01:25:37.998 --> 01:25:41.434
And five more she missed. Three I'm sure of.

1183
01:25:41.435 --> 01:25:43.970
Rebecka was the first, just as you thought.

1184
01:25:43.971 --> 01:25:47.407
The second, M.H., is Mari
Holmberg, a prostitute in Kalmar,

1185
01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:50.410
murdered in 1954, matching Leviticus 20:18.

1186
01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:53.279
Right. "If a man lies with
a woman having her sickness,

1187

he has made naked her
fountain and she has uncovered

1188
01:25:56.150 --> 01:25:57.717
the fountain of her blood."

1189
01:25:57.718 --> 01:26:01.754
Raped and stabbed, but cause of death
was suffocation by sanitary napkin.

01:26:01.755 --> 01:26:04.757
- Okay.
- R.L. Rakel Lunde, 1957.

1191
01:26:04.758 --> 01:26:07.427
A cleaning woman and part-time palm reader.

1192
01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:11.164
Tied with a clothesline, gagged,
raped. Head crushed with a rock.

1193
01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:12.832
Leviticus 20:27.

1196
01:26:17.171 --> 01:26:21.307
- I usually like to smoke outside.
- Sara Witt, 1964.

1197
01:26:21.308 --> 01:26:23.409
Daughter of a pastor. Tied to her bed.

1198
01:26:23.410 --> 01:26:26.245
Raped. Charred in the fire
that burned down her house.

1199
01:26:26.246 --> 01:26:27.847
Leviticus 21:9.

1200

"The daughter of a priest who profanes
herself by playing the harlot,

Magda Lovisa Sjöberg, 1960.

1203
01:26:35.789 --> 01:26:38.357
Found in a barn. Stabbed
and raped with farm tools.

1204
01:26:38.358 --> 01:26:40.626
The cow in the next stall had its throat slit.

1205
01:26:40.627 --> 01:26:42.862
Its blood was splashed on her and hers on it.

1206
01:26:42.863 --> 01:26:45.565
Leviticus 20:16. "If a

Found by her sister in their
pet shop. Raped, beaten.

1210
01:26:53.574 --> 01:26:56.375
The killer uncaged the
animals, smashed the aquariums.

1211
01:26:56.376 --> 01:26:58.711
There was a parakeet inside her.

1212
01:26:58.712 --> 01:27:01.080
Next, Eva Gustavsson, 1960.

1213
01:27:01.081 --> 01:27:05.785
A runaway. Raped, strangled. A
burnt pigeon tied around her neck.

1214
01:27:05.786 --> 01:27:09.856
Lena Andersson, 1967. A student.
Raped, stabbed, decapitated...

1215
01:27:09.857 --> 01:27:12.358
- Okay.
- I'm not finished.

1216
01:27:12.359 --> 01:27:14.393
We're looking for a serial murderer,

1217
01:27:14.394 --> 01:27:18.531
but what could that have to do with
a teenager living on an island?

1218
01:27:18.532 --> 01:27:21.801
She was looking for him too.

- Am I missing anything?
- The names.

1222
01:27:29.076 --> 01:27:30.409
They're all Biblical.

1223
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:33.045
The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary.

1224
01:27:33.046 --> 01:27:36.949
Rebecka, Sara, all from the Old Testament.

1225
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:40.325
Which means they're all Jewish.

1226
01:27:40.854 --> 01:27:46.504
One thing the Vangers have more than
their fair share of, it's anti-Semites.

absolutely nothing wrong with me.

And then we have poachers. They

Henrik's notes, my notes, Lisbeth's research.

1366
01:40:43.503 --> 01:40:47.539
What I don't have is Vanger Industries'
records. That's what I want.

1367
01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:50.542
- Why?
- Will you authorize it?

01:40:50.543 --> 01:40:53.312
What, the private corporate
records? Well, how far back?

1369
01:40:53.313 --> 01:40:56.548
Henrik said I could have access to
everything. This is what I need.

1370
01:40:56.549 --> 01:41:00.252
- That's not what he meant.
- I'll sign a nondisclosure statement.

1371
01:41:00.253 --> 01:41:02.900
Just a minute.

1372
01:41:04.457 --> 01:41:06.024

1373
01:41:06.025 --> 01:41:11.229

him from himself. It's insane.

1375

After 120 years of business, probably a lot.

1376
01:41:16.469 --> 01:41:20.788
If this is what he needs to
finish, he should have permission.

What am I looking for?

1378

1465
01:54:32.331 --> 01:54:36.673
Come on in. I'll make you a drink.

1467
01:55:23.515 --> 01:55:26.264
Hello, Martin.

1468
01:55:26.485 --> 01:55:30.497
Shut the door. It's quite windy.

1469
01:55:34.159 --> 01:55:36.260
- What happened to you?
- When?

1470
01:55:36.261 --> 01:55:37.762
Just now.

1471
01:55:37.763 --> 01:55:40.264
I, heh, fell in the dark.

1472
01:55:40.265 --> 01:55:43.000
You don't have a flashlight? I'll get you one.

1473
01:55:43.001 --> 01:55:45.837
I just wasn't being careful, that's all.

1474

1475
01:55:52.211 --> 01:55:55.046
How's the investigation going?

1476
01:55:55.047 --> 01:55:57.915
- Nothing new to report.
- No?

1477
01:55:57.916 --> 01:56:03.430
Dirch says the girl is really clever.

1478
01:56:06.925 --> 01:56:08.693
Maybe she'll turn something up.

1479
01:56:08.694 --> 01:56:10.061
Maybe.

1480
01:56:10.062 --> 01:56:12.902
Thank you for that.

1481
01:56:17.803 --> 01:56:19.937
- So, what did he say?
- What?

1482
01:56:19.938 --> 01:56:22.206
You said Henrik asked you to ask me something.

1483
01:56:22.207 --> 01:56:24.375
- Well, I just did.
- What?

1484
01:56:24.376 --> 01:56:27.044
- How's the investigation?
- Oh, yeah.

1485
01:56:27.045 --> 01:56:30.260
That was his question.

1486
01:56:35.821 --> 01:56:38.456
Do you hunt?

1487
01:56:38.457 --> 01:56:40.391
We should go hunting together sometime.

1488
01:56:40.392 --> 01:56:43.141
Sure.

1489
01:56:44.429 --> 01:56:48.266
Nothing at all new to report?

1490
01:56:48.267 --> 01:56:50.301
No. Nothing.

1491
01:56:50.302 --> 01:56:52.570
- I can see you're anxious.
- No.

1492
01:56:52.571 --> 01:56:54.906
No, I mean to get home after the walk.

1493
01:56:54.907 --> 01:56:56.974
Yeah, well, I suppose I am.

1494
01:56:56.975 --> 01:56:59.677
To have dinner with your girlfriend.

1495
01:56:59.678 --> 01:57:02.086
Assistant.

1496
01:57:04.549 --> 01:57:06.550
We'll have better luck with a gun.

1497
01:57:06.551 --> 01:57:10.288
- I'm sorry?
- When we go hunting.

1498
01:57:10.289 --> 01:57:14.472
A gun. Rather than a knife.

1499
01:57:17.195 --> 01:57:20.103
I want to show you something.

1500
01:57:20.332 --> 01:57:21.866
Bring your drink.

1501
01:57:21.867 --> 01:57:23.601
Leave my knife.

1506

You know what's harder than shooting someone?

1507
01:57:50.462 --> 01:57:52.530
Just missing him.

1508
01:57:52.531 --> 01:57:55.132
That was a very good shot up at the cabin.

1509
01:57:55.133 --> 01:57:57.802
It didn't work. I'm here.

1510
01:57:57.803 --> 01:58:01.772

1515
01:59:14.746 --> 01:59:18.030
Spilled your drink.

1516
01:59:28.193 --> 01:59:30.961
Why didn't you just go home?

1517
01:59:30.962 --> 01:59:33.802
May I? Heh.

1518
01:59:37.569 --> 01:59:40.443
How did you do it?

1519
01:59:40.839 --> 01:59:42.606
What did you find?

1520
01:59:42.607 --> 01:59:45.356
<font color=#ff00ff>[GRUNTS]</font>

1521
01:59:45.777 --> 01:59:48.846
We can talk or we can just get on with it.

1522
01:59:48.847 --> 01:59:51.615
I found a photograph

1523
01:59:51.616 --> 01:59:53.350
no one has seen.

1524
01:59:53.351 --> 01:59:55.119
- Of?
- You.

1525
01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:57.221
In an Uppsala prep school blazer.

1526
01:59:57.222 --> 01:59:59.256
What does that prove?

1527
01:59:59.257 --> 02:00:01.392
You lied about where you were that day.

1528
02:00:01.393 --> 02:00:03.994
- Did I?
- Or rather, when.

1529
02:00:03.995 --> 02:00:06.530
So what? People lie all the time.

1530
02:00:06.531 --> 02:00:10.301
It also says that you and Lena
Andersson were schoolmates.

1531
02:00:10.302 --> 02:00:13.037
Lena.

1532
02:00:13.038 --> 02:00:16.574
That was a long time ago.

1533
02:00:16.575 --> 02:00:19.810
Where's this photo now? Is it with
all the other crap on your desk?

1534
02:00:19.811 --> 02:00:22.513
There's a copy on my
laptop. There's another copy

1535
02:00:22.514 --> 02:00:25.649
- on a secure website.
- Secure website. Ha-ha-ha.

1536
02:00:25.650 --> 02:00:28.661
That's a lie.

1537
02:00:29.054 --> 02:00:31.856
How much does the girl know?

1538
02:00:31.857 --> 02:00:33.691
I hope it's as much as you do.

1539
02:00:33.692 --> 02:00:36.527
That'll make it fun.

1540
02:00:36.528 --> 02:00:37.761
Where is she?

1541
02:00:37.762 --> 02:00:40.030
Stockholm. She went this morning.

1542
02:00:40.031 --> 02:00:41.699
That's a lie.

1543
02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:44.935
She's at our offices looking at more old crap.

1544
02:00:44.936 --> 02:00:47.204
I got a call from our archives manager.

1545
02:00:47.205 --> 02:00:50.441
She was very perturbed with this girl Lisbeth.

1546
02:00:50.442 --> 02:00:52.276
I like that name.

1547
02:00:52.277 --> 02:00:54.578
Lisbeth.

1548
02:00:54.579 --> 02:00:58.782
So when Lisbeth leaves, I
will get a call from security,

1549
02:00:58.783 --> 02:01:03.330
so I can be at your cottage to greet her.

1550
02:01:03.655 --> 02:01:07.491
I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me.

1551
02:01:07.492 --> 02:01:09.226
Hey, hey.

1552
02:01:09.227 --> 02:01:13.205
<font color=#ff00ff>[###]</font>

1553
02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:39.102
So, what do you wanna know?

1554
02:01:40.292 --> 02:01:43.872
You're a journalist, ask me questions.

1555
02:01:47.732 --> 02:01:49.867
What do I do with the girls?

1556
02:01:49.868 --> 02:01:51.869
That's a good question.

1557
02:01:51.870 --> 02:01:53.938
Well, before, I do what we're doing:

1558
02:01:53.939 --> 02:01:56.440
Sit down, relax, have a drink.

1559
02:01:56.441 --> 02:01:57.741
I like that part a lot.

1560
02:01:57.742 --> 02:02:02.246
Having a chat when both of you know
that one of you is going to die.

1561
02:02:02.247 --> 02:02:06.083
And afterwards, I just get
rid of them, far out at sea.

1562
02:02:06.084 --> 02:02:08.886
Unlike my father, who left them scattered

1563
02:02:08.887 --> 02:02:13.090
all over the place, like trophies.
That's not very smart, if you ask me.

1564
02:02:13.091 --> 02:02:15.859
Well, he was a loud and garish man.

1565
02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:19.163
Frankly, he got what he deserved.

1566
02:02:19.164 --> 02:02:21.632
You can't be a sloppy technician like that.

1567
02:02:21.633 --> 02:02:24.068
You can't drink to excess like he did.

1568
02:02:24.069 --> 02:02:26.237
This takes discipline.

1569
02:02:26.238 --> 02:02:29.039
It's a science of a thousand details.

1570
02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:31.875
The planning, the execution.

1571
02:02:31.876 --> 02:02:34.211
It's the cleanup.

1572
02:02:34.212 --> 02:02:36.046
I guess I don't have to tell you,

1573
02:02:36.047 --> 02:02:38.315
but you're going to create quite a mess here.

1574
02:02:38.316 --> 02:02:39.516
<font color=#ff00ff>[COUGHING]</font>

1575
02:02:39.517 --> 02:02:42.086
Shh-shh-shh. Shh.

1576
02:02:42.087 --> 02:02:44.188
Let me ask you something.

1577
02:02:44.189 --> 02:02:47.725
Why don't people trust their instincts?

1578
02:02:47.726 --> 02:02:49.393
They sense something is wrong,

1579
02:02:49.394 --> 02:02:52.296
someone is walking too close behind them.

1580
02:02:52.297 --> 02:02:54.798
You knew something was wrong.

1581
02:02:54.799 --> 02:02:56.700
But you came back into the house.

1582
02:02:56.701 --> 02:03:00.704
Did I force you? Did I drag you in? No.

1583
02:03:00.705 --> 02:03:04.742
All I had to do was offer you a drink.

1584
02:03:04.743 --> 02:03:07.278
It's hard to believe that the fear of offending

1585
02:03:07.279 --> 02:03:13.566
can be stronger than the fear of
pain, but you know what? It is.

1586
02:03:13.885 --> 02:03:16.153
And they always come willingly.

1587
02:03:16.154 --> 02:03:17.621
And then they sit there.

1588
02:03:17.622 --> 02:03:20.291
They know it's all over, just like you do.

1589
02:03:20.292 --> 02:03:23.327
But somehow, they still
think they have a chance.

1590
02:03:23.328 --> 02:03:25.462
"Maybe if I say the right thing.

1591
02:03:25.463 --> 02:03:27.464
Maybe if I'm polite.

1592
02:03:27.465 --> 02:03:30.301
If I cry, if I beg."

1593
02:03:30.302 --> 02:03:32.870
And when I see the hope
draining from their face,

1594
02:03:32.871 --> 02:03:35.639
like it is from yours right now,

1595
02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:37.775
I can feel myself...

1596
02:03:37.776 --> 02:03:40.388
getting hard.

1597
02:03:40.545 --> 02:03:45.115
But, you know, we're not that different,
you and I. We both have urges.

1598
02:03:45.116 --> 02:03:47.318
Satisfying mine

1599
02:03:47.319 --> 02:03:50.728
requires more towels.

is a ward of the state?

1656
02:10:07.732 --> 02:10:13.109
I'm mentally incompetent
and can't manage daily life.

1657
02:10:14.338 --> 02:10:17.174
Since when have they said that?

1658
02:10:17.175 --> 02:10:21.187
Since I was 12.

1659
02:10:21.345 --> 02:10:24.458
What happened when you were 12?

1660
02:10:27.085 --> 02:10:32.201
I'm sorry, that's... That's none of my business.

1661
02:10:33.391 --> 02:10:36.402
I tried to kill my father.

1662
02:10:37.261 --> 02:10:39.963
Burned him alive.

1663
02:10:39.964 --> 02:10:45.410
Got about 80 percent of him.

1664
02:10:47.105 --> 02:10:49.444

02:10:50.742 --> 02:10:52.843

I found it in Martin's

No, Martin didn't deny killing anyone.

1670
02:11:07.925 --> 02:11:11.528
But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused.

1671
02:11:11.529 --> 02:11:16.032
He got angry at me because I couldn't
tell him what had happened to her.

1672
02:11:16.033 --> 02:11:18.602
He didn't kill her.

1673
02:11:18.603 --> 02:11:23.707
His father didn't do it. He
was dead the year before.

1674
02:11:23.708 --> 02:11:28.445
What if she did somehow manage to get away?

1675
02:11:28.446 --> 02:11:30.820
I mean, if...

1676
02:11:31.115 --> 02:11:34.785
she is still alive,

1677
02:11:34.786 --> 02:11:40.266

1689
02:12:56.234 --> 02:12:58.101
- Has no one called you?
- About?

1690
02:12:58.102 --> 02:13:00.942
Your cousin Martin.

1691
02:13:01.239 --> 02:13:04.641
- What about him?
- He died in a car accident

1692
02:13:04.642 --> 02:13:07.611
last Thursday. There's going
to be a memorial in Hedestad.

1693
02:13:07.612 --> 02:13:10.413
I'm not interested in any memorial.

1694

- Well, I understand.
- What do you understand?

1695
02:13:12.884 --> 02:13:15.719
Well, that you don't care
very much for your family.

1696

She's on.

1701
02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:45.097

1702
02:13:53.758 --> 02:13:56.159

Put your hand back in my shirt.

she hasn't called Harriet.

1708
02:14:12.410 --> 02:14:16.479

02:14:37.802 --> 02:14:42.610

could be one other possibility.

1716
02:14:48.179 --> 02:14:51.019
<font color=#FF551>ANITA:</font> Well, we could, absolutely.

1717

What is it now?

1718
02:14:53.417 --> 02:14:57.327
Before he died, your brother
hung me from a hook...

1719
02:14:58.622 --> 02:15:01.371
Harriet.

1720
02:15:03.227 --> 02:15:04.961
<font color=#FF551>MIKAEL:</font> So you sent the flowers.

1721
02:15:04.962 --> 02:15:07.163
<font color=#FF551>HARRIET:</font> Yes, I did.

1722
02:15:07.164 --> 02:15:11.034
<font color=#FF551>MIKAEL:</font> We found in the Swedish Family
Registry that Anita was married.

1723
02:15:11.035 --> 02:15:14.270
- But the family never knew, did they?
- No.

1724
02:15:14.271 --> 02:15:17.874
So I'm guessing she then came
here on her married-name passport,

1725
02:15:17.875 --> 02:15:20.310
and you followed on her maiden-name passport.

1726
02:15:20.311 --> 02:15:22.846
No, actually, it was the other way around.

1727
02:15:22.847 --> 02:15:27.183
She thought that it was safer if
I traveled with Spencer myself.

1728
02:15:27.184 --> 02:15:29.652
Well, what did he think about that?

1729
02:15:29.653 --> 02:15:33.256
Nothing. Only that he loved her.

1730
02:15:33.257 --> 02:15:37.427
She said, "If you love me,
you'll do this and not ask why."

1731
02:15:37.428 --> 02:15:39.195
And he never did.

1732
02:15:39.196 --> 02:15:41.064
And they both died 20 years ago.

1733
02:15:41.065 --> 02:15:42.465
Car accident.

1734
02:15:42.466 --> 02:15:46.182
You found that out too.

1735
02:15:50.041 --> 02:15:52.881
Is that you?

1736
02:15:58.382 --> 02:16:02.185
I was 14 the first time he raped me.

1737
02:16:02.186 --> 02:16:03.453
Martin.

1738
02:16:03.454 --> 02:16:05.588
No, my father.

1739
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:09.893
Martin only started after he had died.

1740
02:16:09.894 --> 02:16:13.930
- Well, why didn't you tell somebody?
- I did. My mother.

1741
02:16:13.931 --> 02:16:17.200
- Henrik would've done something.
- I almost told him.

1742
02:16:17.201 --> 02:16:20.303
But I was afraid because of what I'd done.

1743
02:16:20.304 --> 02:16:24.908
- I, uh...
- You still don't understand, do you?

1744
02:16:24.909 --> 02:16:27.811
A year after the first time,

1745
02:16:27.812 --> 02:16:33.116
and there were many times during that year,

1746
02:16:33.117 --> 02:16:37.720
my father got drunker than usual one night

1747
02:16:37.721 --> 02:16:43.860
and he started bragging
about the women he'd killed.

1748
02:16:43.861 --> 02:16:47.730
He quoted from the Bible
as he tore my clothes off.

1749
02:16:47.731 --> 02:16:50.600
<i>He tied a belt around my neck.</i>

1750
02:16:50.601 --> 02:16:53.536
He wanted to kill me.

1751
02:16:53.537 --> 02:16:54.938
<font color=#ff00ff>[SNIFFLES]</font>

1752
02:16:54.939 --> 02:16:58.475
I, um... I got out of the house.

1753
02:16:58.476 --> 02:16:59.943
<i>I went down to the dock.</i>

1754
02:16:59.944 --> 02:17:04.195
He came staggering after me.

1755
02:17:04.482 --> 02:17:07.117
I could never fight him off in a small space,

1756
02:17:07.118 --> 02:17:10.253
<i>but out in the open,</i>

1757
02:17:10.254 --> 02:17:14.539
I was strong enough to deal with an old drunk.

1758
02:17:16.727 --> 02:17:20.130
When it was over...

1759
02:17:20.131 --> 02:17:25.602
<i>I looked up and Martin was
standing there, staring at me.</i>

1760
02:17:25.603 --> 02:17:31.947
And all I'd accomplished was
substitute one for another.

1761
02:17:33.177 --> 02:17:37.981
<i>A couple of months later, Henrik
sent Martin to school in Uppsala.</i>

1762
02:17:37.982 --> 02:17:44.463
And I thought that maybe, just maybe,
the nightmare was finally over.

1763
02:17:44.522 --> 02:17:48.424
<i>And then I saw him the day of the parade,</i>

1764
02:17:48.425 --> 02:17:51.027
<i>across the street.</i>

1765
02:17:51.028 --> 02:17:55.999
<i>And I knew that it would never be over.</i>

1766
02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.700
So how did you escape?

1767
02:17:57.701 --> 02:18:00.637
Anita. She...

1768
02:18:00.638 --> 02:18:04.107
She insisted that I leave everything behind.

1769
02:18:04.108 --> 02:18:09.179
If I took anything the police might
have suspected that I was still alive.

1770
02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:15.351
<i>As everyone ate dinner, I was no
more than 20 meters away from them.</i>

1771
02:18:15.352 --> 02:18:19.722
<i>I spent the night there.
That's when the search started.</i>

1772
02:18:19.723 --> 02:18:23.660
<i>In the morning, she came to get me.</i>

1773
02:18:23.661 --> 02:18:27.997
<i>I'd grown up with that
bridge as my link to home,</i>

1774
02:18:27.998 --> 02:18:30.667
<i>but all I could think is,</i>

1775
02:18:30.668 --> 02:18:34.179
if I could just get away from them,

1776
02:18:34.371 --> 02:18:37.173
<i>just get past the police,</i>

1777
02:18:37.174 --> 02:18:40.549
<i>then I might be safe.</i>

1778
02:18:42.446 --> 02:18:44.847
<i>And I was.</i>

1779
02:18:44.848 --> 02:18:47.995
Until you showed up.

1780
02:18:48.219 --> 02:18:50.831
You're safe now.

1781
02:18:52.323 --> 02:18:55.265
How did you get away?

1782
02:18:55.726 --> 02:18:59.135
Someone saved me too.

working here, much less being fired.

1792
02:20:24.882 --> 02:20:27.183
How could you? It was such a long time ago,

1793
02:20:27.184 --> 02:20:30.853
which is kind of more to the point
than the money he embezzled from you.

1794
02:20:30.854 --> 02:20:33.489
You're referring to the statute of limitations,

1795
02:20:33.490 --> 02:20:36.693
but I had no idea this is
what Henrik was holding out.

1796
02:20:36.694 --> 02:20:39.562
If I had, I never would've
let him bring you up here.

1797
02:20:39.563 --> 02:20:41.264
He wasn't trying to deceive you.

1798

35 years after the event.

1799
02:20:44.134 --> 02:20:47.837
- I like Henrik, but he knows that.
- A man's reputation means something.

1800
02:20:47.838 --> 02:20:50.907
He believes that. He thought
you could destroy Wennerström

1801
02:20:50.908 --> 02:20:54.177
- in the court of public opinion.
- The court of public opinion

- He's an elderly man.

1803

He promised me Wennerström's carcass on a plate.

This isn't even the plate.

1805

- Yes, of course.

1806
02:21:08.759 --> 02:21:11.427
What happened with Wennerström?

1807
02:21:11.428 --> 02:21:13.363
How did he get you?

1808
02:21:13.364 --> 02:21:18.301
I was stupid. I heard something.
I got it from an anonymous source,

1809
02:21:18.302 --> 02:21:22.712
who I'm now sure was one
of Wennerström's lackeys.

1810
02:21:22.806 --> 02:21:24.474
It was fake.

1811
02:21:24.475 --> 02:21:26.976
Which he easily proved in court.

1812
02:21:26.977 --> 02:21:29.812
You were emphatic that the
way I looked into your life

1813
02:21:29.813 --> 02:21:33.316
was illegal and immoral. Would you
feel the same about Wennerström?

1814
02:21:33.317 --> 02:21:36.285
- Go on.
- I did some work on my own on him

1815
02:21:36.286 --> 02:21:38.988
before you hired me. I haven't looked at it all

1816
02:21:38.989 --> 02:21:41.357
because you and Harriet-fucking-Vanger

1817

1818
02:21:44.294 --> 02:21:46.262

1819
02:21:46.263 --> 02:21:49.308

1820
02:21:49.333 --> 02:21:50.633
