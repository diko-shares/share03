6
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,900
And love slipped the bonds of restraint.

7
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:55,614
His touch was like a cosmic "yes."

8
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,034
"Fuck you," screamed Kelly.
"Fuck you to hell."

9
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:05,415
Scott stepped back from the cell door
as the gob of spit flew. "Fuck you."

10
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,754
This matrix is what Hardy
meant by "the ache of modernism."

11
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,549
Crap.

12
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:17,219
Inchcombe knew too well
the dreadful mundanity of murder.

13
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,472
But Patel was stricken.

14
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,060
Inchcombe realized
his lack of feeling was almost...

15
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,187
Pathological.

16
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,733
"I've been wearing the wrong size
all my life" says Katie.

17
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:37,573
"I was always popping out.
Turns out I'm a 30 GG" she says.

18
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,701
'Now my bras finally fit.

19
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,372
Though Simon prefers me
without one."'

20
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,962
We can go round mine, if you like.

21
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,299
And watch your dad
farting into a sofa?

22
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,100
A taxi?

23
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,145
In Ewedown?

24
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,606
Come on.
Where are we going?

25
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,774
Nowhere.

26
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,075
Glen, can I tempt you?
Thank you.

27
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,454
I often take something snacky
to Nicholas this time of day.

28
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,457
I know how the brain needs feeding.
Mm.

29
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,752
So how you settling in?

30
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,961
Great.

31
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:37,257
The last writers' retreat I was at, I
kind of froze my balls off, you know?

32
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,801
Screeching fire doors
and curried lasagna,

33
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,555
and a needy poet,
from whom I still bear the scars.

34
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:48,477
Well, we try to keep it peaceful here.
Far from the madding crowd.

35
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,145
May I?

36
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,481
Well, it's paradise.

37
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,945
In Ewedown?
What are you doing there?

38
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,529
I haven't told her yet.

39
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,242
Why not? You keep saying
you want to be with me.

40
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:08,121
Well, I can't tell her just like that.
It's 25 years. A marriage.

41
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,499
Come on, Nicholas.

42
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,085
Or I'm gonna get in a taxi
and find your farm.

43
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,420
No.
Come up there and I'll drag you out.

44
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,756
No, don't.

45
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,842
I wanted to be with you.
I thought you'd be pleased.

46
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,553
Well, of course I'm pleased.

47
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,934
Nadia, go to the pub and stay there.
I'll come when I can.

48
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,602
Are you going to tell her?

49
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,437
Just give me a couple of hours.

50
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,065
Cock pie.

51
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,193
How's the worker?
Good, actually.

52
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,237
Just about to embark on forensics.

53
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,615
Well, give me your pages
and I'll get started.

54
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,909
Reckon I might pack it in
a bit early today.

55
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,161
Need to think about my blood smears.

56
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,872
Might take a drive, have a pint.

57
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,125
Stir the old grey matter up.

58
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,585
Who were you talking to just then?

59
00:04:55,753 --> 00:05:01,216
Judy. She said the Impala contract
should be through in a day or two.

60
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,135
I could come with you.

61
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,845
What?
For a drive.

62
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,722
I don't know when we last went out.

63
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,349
This is absolutely yummy.

64
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,727
Or we could go into Hadditon,
get a meal.

65
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,312
Yes.

66
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,689
But what about the guests?

67
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,190
Mary's got Casey to help.

68
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,068
But I'm supposed to be
thinking, you know, about...

69
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,739
You can run it by me.
I'm good at forensics.

70
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,336
Andy, can I tempt you?

71
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,672
We've got a new academic.
Glen, American.

72
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,924
Turns out he's working
on Thomas Hardy.

73
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,469
Said he might have
some farming questions.

74
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,263
Needs an expert yokel, does he?
Would you mind?

75
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,974
And the... The writers are
eating alfresco tonight.

76
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,311
Could you check there's no
bird shit on the seats? Sorry.

77
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,854
You okay?

78
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,440
Yes.

79
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,276
Nicholas and l
are going out to dinner.

80
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,537
Now.

81
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,125
Fucking bingo.

82
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,890
What a dump.

83
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,342
Yeah.
We could walk up the garage.

84
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,846
I'm supposed to be helping
my mom up at Stonefield.

85
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,390
They keep you busy.
Yeah.

86
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,017
You never stop, you.

87
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,728
Bet them writers are wankers.

88
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,856
It was called From Hearth to Heath:

89
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,608
The Doomsday and Revelation
in Victorian Verse.

90
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,818
What was it about?

91
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:29,156
Well, you know, pale poets on laudanum
and dark towers and sunless seas.

92
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,324
A little "Sturm und Drang" in a teacup.

93
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,534
Did it sell?

94
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:38,165
Well, of course, my kind of books aren't
about sales, that's not why I write. So, no.

95
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,294
So, what are you working on next?

96
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,795
Thomas Hardy.

97
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,132
Is there anything left to say
about that maudlin bore?

98
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,969
Excuse me, but there's nothing dull about Hardy.
That is a misconception.

99
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,931
At least you've been published.
I'm seething with envy.

100
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,518
I'd love to be published.
I publish myself on the Internet.

101
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,146
Do you earn money doing that?
No.

102
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,106
What do you write?
Lesbian crime.

103
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,903
I'm here picking up tips
from the master.

104
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,745
- Beth?
- Yeah?

105
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,039
Why don't I just pop out on my own?

106
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,249
Well, I'm ready now. Come on.

107
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,043
Is that...?

108
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,420
I mean, are you wearing that?

109
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,343
It just looks a bit hot.

110
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,931
You know, Hadditon's always packed
with pissed Londonites on a Friday.

111
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,599
I doubt we get a table anyway.

112
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,268
Let's do it properly next week.
Make an occasion.

113
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,939
I'm always taking you for granted.
I'm vile, I know.

114
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,650
You should kick me, really.

115
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,444
Who is she?

116
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,321
What?

117
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,950
Come on, Beth.

118
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,993
Tell me who.

119
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,374
Look, it's nothing.

120
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,418
It's been once or twice, that's all.
It's just...

121
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,463
Beth, it's not anything.
Who is she?

122
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,216
So she's on her way in,
the bride and groom are...

123
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,135
Just a researcher on Radio 4.
What's her name?

124
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,888
Nadia. Nadia Patel.
Patel? She's in your book.

125
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,182
No. No. I met her when I was on
Desert Island Discs.

126
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,351
You put her in your book.
Well, just the name.

127
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,144
Desert Island Discs was a year ago.
Yes...

128
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,354
So "once or twice"?

129
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,814
I was going to tell you.

130
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,816
In the book, from your woman.

131
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,818
Saying that they're coming
to the par...

132
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,154
I've had enough of this.
Beth. I'm a ruin, I know.

133
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,574
But I've been in a real state
about this.

134
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,993
I didn't want to hurt you.

135
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,870
How could you lie to my face?

136
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,498
Can we talk calmly?
There are people out there.

137
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,333
You looked me in the face and lied.

138
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,544
For God's sake,
we're surrounded by novelists.

139
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,088
You bastard.
Beth,

140
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,091
we're like a pair of compasses.
Don't you dare.

141
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,093
Joined solidly at the top,

142
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,138
but with the ends
able to roam in freedom.

143
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,475
That's her, isn't it?
Are you keeping her waiting?

144
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,519
We've talked a lot
about the creative mind,

145
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,022
and we agreed it needs a
certain freedom to explore.

146
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,691
Take your freedom.
I can't live like this anymore.

147
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,235
It makes me feel worthless.
Calm yourself down.

148
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,363
Go set up home with Patel.
See if she does your tax returns.

149
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,490
Do you love her? Is she young?

150
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,367
For heaven's sake...
Is she?!

151
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,411
Yes!

152
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,210
If you leave here tonight
to be with her, don't come back.

153
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,340
Beth, you're making fools of us both.

154
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,509
Liar!

155
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,225
Fuck.

156
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:48,521
I didn't know
they provided material too.

157
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,244
Beth does everything for him, you know.
Types his manuscript,

158
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,581
deals with his agent, makes his
female characters convincing.

159
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,042
She even came up with the name
Dr. Inchcombe.

160
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,586
No wonder he's bored.

161
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,340
I hope she takes him
to the fucking cleaners.

162
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,354
At the end of the day,
this is why I'm glad I'm single.

163
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,078
Will she take him back though?
That's the question.

164
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,288
Would you?
Well, I'd be torn.

165
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,375
He's far too up himself.
Yeah, but what about their farm?

166
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,045
Splitting up all this?
Must be worth a fortune.

167
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,965
Nadia Patel.

168
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:01,052
"Gazelle eyes." "Tantric sex."

169
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,055
She's very rash, making him choose.

170
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,517
Why would he choose me?

171
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:14,691
I thought you weren't going to come.
I was busy. Rowing with my wife.

172
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,152
Where are we going?
Home.

173
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,486
To your farm?

174
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,118
We could have gone on just as we were.

175
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,329
Yes, but you said
you wanted to be with me.

176
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,833
Yes. In London.

177
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,585
Now and then.

178
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,183
Big glass of Rioja, please.
And I need a room.

179
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,101
Sure. How many nights?

180
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,353
Don't know. Just one?

181
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:56,649
Are you here for the writers' retreat?
No, but I'm a writer.

182
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,109
Well, journalist.

183
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,946
I don't mean to pry.
I'm just really nosey.

184
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,948
I'm from here. Sort of.

185
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,202
Well, it's a nice place. I love it.

186
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:11,956
I keep meaning to leave, but...
Hard to get away.

187
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,042
My mom's house is just up the road.

188
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,378
You're not staying with her?
She's... She died.

189
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,380
Have that on me.

190
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,967
And here's your key.

191
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,429
Up the stairs, right in front.
You can't miss it.

192
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,139
Thanks.

193
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,188
Didn't think I'd see you tonight.

194
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,733
Bit of an atmosphere at Stonefield.
Tell me everything.

195
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,362
Marriage. Remind me never to try it.

196
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,950
Andy, you're just a sex object.
No one would have you.

197
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,435
So the Hardiments have
lived here for centuries?

198
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,772
No. About 20 years.

199
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,899
Still strangers, by local standards.

200
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,954
Andy, come look at Ingrid.

201
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,498
I think she's coming into heat.

202
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,462
She's very nice, Beth.

203
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,465
Yeah. I owe her a lot.

204
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,677
Husband's kind of a sleazebag?

205
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,305
We'd say "prick" here, actually.

206
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,015
Or wanker.

207
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,269
That's good.
We might even call him a fuck.

208
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,147
That's good too.

209
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,823
Can I help?
It's going rotten underneath.

210
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,201
Can I have a look at Ingrid?
Look, it's... It's falling apart.

211
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,245
Yeah, well, I can do that. Beth...

212
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,625
He won't last five minutes.

213
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:38,102
Jesus. He's been translated
into Icelandic and Swahili.

214
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,523
What an output.

215
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,902
I need my book to be a success.

216
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,239
I need a tiny reward
for all my endeavors.

217
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,244
I need a dump.

218
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,139
- Beth.
- No, don't touch me.

219
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,891
Don't you dare.
I'm sorry.

220
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,227
Not good enough, not anymore.
I'm sorry.

221
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,437
You do what you like,
then you're sorry?

222
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,232
I hate myself. I hate myself.

223
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,150
Where were you?

224
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,945
I drove her back to London.
Took all night.

225
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:33,783
You drove her home?
I finished it. She was in a state.

226
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,454
- So it's over?
- I'm sorry.

227
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,709
I don't know why I'm like this.

228
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,421
I couldn't manage without you.

229
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,155
I've got to go to the bottle bank.

230
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,740
Okay.

231
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,994
- Let's talk later.
- Yeah.

232
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,123
- The goat's come into heat.
- Has it?

233
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,961
I love you so much.

234
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,714
Me too.

235
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,573
I've just seen the Hardiments kiss
and make up.

236
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,868
The hat's on.
Looks like she's taking him back.

237
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,330
When the hat's on,
it means don't speak.

238
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:06,626
So peace is restored.

239
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,463
For fuck's sake!

240
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,800
I don't like cows.
Yeah.

241
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,969
They exude bovine malice.
Yeah.

242
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,347
These girls are killing machines.

243
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,891
They don't like Americans either.
Very funny.

244
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,812
It's Winnards Farm.

245
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:29,273
Lady there died a while back.
Place is empty.

246
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,567
Think it's being robbed?
Nah.

247
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,611
Probably just kids.

248
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,906
Nothing to do around here
except make trouble.

249
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,035
What if it's bad guys?

250
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,163
Don't you have a blunderbuss
or a fowling piece or something?

251
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,210
Used to belong to my dad, this place.

252
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,004
Really?
But it all went tits up.

253
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,591
The land was flogged to a consortium
and the house sold to Londoners.

254
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,554
The Drewes.
So this is your ancestral pile?

255
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,305
Was.

256
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,724
Born in that room up there.

257
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,644
You must have been pretty resentful.

258
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:13,192
This farm's mine, big nose.

259
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,412
Hey, what are you doing?
Who are you?

260
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,123
Andy, you moron. It's me.

261
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,834
Tam?

262
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,128
I didn't even recognize you.

263
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,173
Well, you won't do it that way.

264
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,091
Then help me.

265
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,759
Used to do bits of work for your mom.

266
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,803
Been keeping an eye on the place
since she died.

267
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,305
What kind of work, graphics?

268
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,933
No, I do horticulture now.
You're a gardener?

269
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,854
This is a great old house.

270
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,106
Thanks. Do you want to buy it?

271
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:56,694
I'm not the property-owning type, no.
I prefer my life to fit in hand luggage.

272
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,364
That why you're back, to flog it?
Yep.

273
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,992
Make a nice second home
for some banker wankers.

274
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,703
Look, Andy, if you want it,
why don't you just make me an offer?

275
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,290
Because, sadly,
I'm still prey to the economic forces

276
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,710
that threw the peasant classes
off the land.

277
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,962
Unlucky.

278
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,797
Tam.

279
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,135
What the fuck have you done
to your nose?

280
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,139
Come on, Andy.
Aliens came and took it.

281
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,641
She's completely different.

282
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,603
What was she like before?
What's the story?

283
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,355
There isn't one.
Come on.

284
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,734
It was nothing. Decade ago.
Just a teenage thing.

285
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,154
You should find someone
you're in love with.

286
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,657
Stupid prick.
You saying you love me, frosty tits?

287
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,825
You first.
You're the girl, you say it.

288
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,202
I love you.

289
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,956
Fuck off. I love you!

290
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,000
Romeo and Juliet?

291
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,545
Something classy in the wood shed?

292
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,182
Would you do him?
No.

293
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,351
What about him?
He's gay, you dobbin.

294
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,728
So?

295
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,021
Swipe.

296
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,233
Ben Sergeant.
I'd walk through fire to do him.

297
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,610
- The drummer?
- He's not just the drummer.

298
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,281
He writes all the lyrics. It's his band.
He's the fucking genius.

299
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,076
Not Steve Culley,
or any of these wankers. It's Ben.

300
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,413
Okay, yeah. I'd do Ben.

301
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,543
I wanna be her, in that dress,
with him licking my teapot lids.

302
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,421
Yeah, me too.

303
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,881
So has the muse shone on you, Greg?

304
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,009
I've been pretty distracted
most recently

305
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:46,887
by those delicious cookie things
Beth brought around this afternoon.

306
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,057
Oh, yes. Of course, we
call them biscuits here.

307
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,310
And by the place itself, the people.

308
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,687
I sometimes wish
I could get distracted.

309
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,731
Ten-page-a-day man,
rain or shine.

310
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,650
That's scary.
Ten pages a day, how do you do that?

311
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,235
Oh, Greg, Glen.

312
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,654
I wouldn't presume
to give an academic tips.

313
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,531
Matter of fact,
I read one of your books...

314
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,743
Another distraction.
... I thought it was decent stuff.

315
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:14,790
Well, how do I do it?
I just get on with it, Greg.

316
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,253
"We call them biscuits here."

317
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,422
To the muse.
The muse.

318
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,674
However you find her.

319
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,593
Cheers.

320
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,803
Who's that?

321
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,932
That's Tamara Drewe.

322
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,436
- No, it isn't.
- I met her with Andy.

323
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,273
Good God, what's happened to her?
She had a nose job, Dad.

324
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,067
She's completely different.

325
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,318
That's what Andy said.

326
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,321
Poor Tamara, she's such a sad girl.

327
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,240
She used to come help you wash
the car, didn't she, Nicholas?

328
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,742
When she was a teenager.

329
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,827
She liked a bit of family
after her dad left.

330
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,621
Is that Tamara Drewe
that writes a column

331
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,997
in one of the Sundays?
Used to.

332
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,249
Writes for The Independent now.

333
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,670
She spent weeks going
on about her nose job.

334
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,007
Was her old one an awful conk?
Yes.

335
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,844
She's poured herself
into those shorts.

336
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,806
Hope they don't give her thrush.

337
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,058
Hello. Sorry to intrude.

338
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,770
Hi, Tamara.
Poppy. How are you?

339
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,730
I love your new hooter.

340
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,483
Thanks. It's not actually new,
it's just smaller.

341
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,986
Tamara. So sorry about your mom.

342
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,239
Thanks.
Are you staying down for long?

343
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,408
I'll have to.
There's so much to be done.

344
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,368
Well, let us know if we can help.

345
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,870
Could you spare a pair of strong arms?

346
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,331
I've got a skip coming tomorrow,
and...

347
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,333
Nicholas?

348
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,169
I'm available.
I do skips.

349
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,839
Nicholas?
Oh, bug...

350
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,885
Thank you, everyone.
You're very kind.

351
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,887
Is Andy around at all?

352
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,764
I can't spare Andy.

353
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,268
He's making a new coop
for my Buff Orpingtons. Heh.

354
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,522
We'll soon have that dry,
don't worry. Heh-heh.

355
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,108
She's had Glen down there
helping her all morning.

356
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,110
I hope she realizes he's here to work.

357
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,529
Can't believe what a difference
her nose makes.

358
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,323
I think it's a mistake.
Taken away all her character.

359
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,742
Come on, she looks 10 times better.

360
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,745
And she knows it.
I found those shorts really irritating.

361
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,665
Going around with half her bum
hanging out. I mean, why?

362
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,501
To annoy people like you.

363
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,044
I might get a pair myself.

364
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,921
Of course you wouldn't.
Why not?

365
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,923
Because you're not desperate, are you?

366
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,844
There was always something
desperate about Tamara Drewe.

367
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,598
Why did you change your face?

368
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,434
Changing my face
is the best thing I ever did.

369
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,603
I don't care what anybody else thinks.

370
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,398
You think it would work for me?
Maybe, if you did the wrinkles too.

371
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,317
You're just coming on to me now.

372
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,992
In your column, you write about yourself.
Does that come easily?

373
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,496
Not easily. Lt just feels right.

374
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,956
My first novel is definitely
going to be autobiographical.

375
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,501
Your first novel? You're gonna
dash one off, just like that?

376
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:08,214
Heh. Ideally, I'd like to make
it into fiction before I'm 30.

377
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:12,218
Then maybe a swimwear collection,
chat show, pasta-sauce range.

378
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,427
What?

379
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,430
Life sure comes easy
for the beautiful.

380
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,726
You know, before I had the nose job,

381
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,646
I had no problem
being taken seriously.

382
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,148
Maybe when they removed
that bit of cartilage,

383
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,859
they pulled out my brain by mistake.

384
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,111
What do you think?

385
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,113
Thank you.

386
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,285
She's single, you know.

387
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,997
Well, it's not exactly a relationship.
We have an occasional thing.

388
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,917
Zoe doesn't wanna be tied down...
Not Zoe.

389
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,962
Tamara.

390
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,215
You should get in there.
Marry the girl. Then you could live

391
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,093
in your ancestral home again.
No. Not her type.

392
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:58,097
Andy, you know, the trouble with you
is that you think like a loser.

393
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,309
I know this because I'm the loser
that all other losers come to for tips.

394
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,144
I am a loser's loser.

395
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,021
I'm a pedigree loser.

396
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,524
Had a graphics business, went bust.

397
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,234
Then with my great business acumen,

398
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,112
I invested in a poly tunnel
full of ganja.

399
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,491
Spent six years stoned out of my box.
I'm only just getting it back together.

400
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,493
Besides,

401
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,746
even if I was the last man
in the world,

402
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,665
Tamara Drewe wouldn't have me.

403
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,166
Why not?

404
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,504
I dumped her.
You are a loser.

405
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,089
I was 20.

406
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,092
And my mates thought
I was cradle-snatching.

407
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,387
And they used to call her Beaky.
Beaky?

408
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,972
Beaky?

409
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,999
Boys know nothing.

410
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:12,296
I've been reading Inchcombe's Dose.
The bit where Dr. Inchcombe

411
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,216
finds himself having thoughts
about the dead guy's daughter.

412
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:21,388
You describe her light smattering
of freckles and her striking profile.

413
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:26,101
So who did you base her on?

414
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,771
Have you noticed me?

415
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,398
Because I've noticed you.

416
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,942
You're making yourself ridiculous.

417
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,781
Nichol-arse!

418
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,951
A man can dream?

419
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,000
No.

420
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,177
Write, you numbskull.

421
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,516
- The best ham I've had in ages.
- Good.

422
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,768
How's Thomas Hardy?

423
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,688
I'm wasting my sabbatical.
Oh, dear.

424
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,692
I've been writing this book forever.
Don't know why I can't finish it.

425
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,486
Two years behind on my delivery date,

426
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,031
and Fantail could ask
for their chickenshit advance back.

427
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,951
I can't write. I'm fucking constipated.

428
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,371
It's a disaster.

429
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,872
Crikey.

430
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,962
Sorry, Glen. I've gotta grab
Andy before he rushes off.

431
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,047
Tamara's asked him to do up her house.

432
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,384
Why? She knows
how hard he works for me.

433
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,556
Is this all his fan mail?

434
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,185
Yeah. I do a couple of sessions
a week to keep on top of it.

435
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,896
Pretty good
at forging Nick's signature.

436
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,819
Why don't we have
a proper chat about it?

437
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,989
Always used to help Nicholas...
You'd do that? You have time?

438
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,492
I'll just...

439
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,930
Tam?

440
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,386
Got some color charts for you to see.

441
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,560
What color do you think
it should be in here?

442
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,023
Well, I was thinking, um,

443
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,569
this one for down here.

444
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,782
And, um...

445
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,703
This one for the bedroom.
Okay.

446
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,961
So, what do you have to do
to get a cup of tea around here?

447
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,007
Make it. Tea, sugar, fridge.

448
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,052
I'm off to work.

449
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,563
Hey!

450
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,234
- This is our village! Our fucking field!
- Go on.

451
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,361
- Get off!
- Come on, bastard. Let us in!

452
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,571
Kiss your mother
with that mouth? Fuck off.

453
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,074
Get on, shove it.

454
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,423
Bullshit! Fuck off!

455
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,886
Swipe is fucking finished!
Steve Culley is a...

456
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,265
Fuck off.
Fran has been shagging that tosser.

457
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,100
Steve, stop it!
Come on then.

458
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,311
Stop it!

459
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,187
I'm Tamara Drewe.
What?

460
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:42,900
I'm supposed to be interviewing you,
for The Independent.

461
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,068
It was scheduled for later,

462
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,113
but is now a good time?

463
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,617
Swipe! Swipe! Swipe!

464
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,411
Swipe! Swipe! Swipe!

465
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,082
- They should let us in for free.
- Too right.

466
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,502
They come here, drink our water,
use our fields.

467
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,796
And they leave all their crap
in our drains.

468
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,423
Nice girlfriend, mate.

469
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,301
Ben. Ben!

470
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,970
What are you doing?
That's Ben from Swipe.

471
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:15,265
And he's got his dog. Ben!

472
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,186
Ben! Ben!

473
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,540
That's Boss.

474
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,168
Up.

475
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,462
Boy. Come on.

476
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,297
Hi, Boss.
There.

477
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,384
Not allergic, are you?
To indie drummers?

478
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,052
Maybe.

479
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,012
Who the fuck's she?

480
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,641
I've seen her up at Stonefield.
She's got a nose made of plastic.

481
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,065
So who are your influences?

482
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,234
Everyone asks that.

483
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,403
I mean, what do you want me to say?
Phil Collins?

484
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,571
Animal from The Muppets?

485
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,242
This your house?
Yeah.

486
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,911
Do you want to buy it?
No.

487
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,748
I want something else.

488
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:27,337
How come she gets Ben?
I've loved him since March.

489
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,842
Would you like a beer?
Yeah.

490
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,887
Maureen Tucker.
Who?

491
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,807
Moe Tucker. The Velvets.
Five-foot-nothing.

492
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,225
Used to stand up to play.

493
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,979
Put the snare drum on its side and
whacked it with mallets. Mentalist.

494
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,440
You write a lot of songs.
That's pretty rare for a drummer.

495
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,317
Yeah, well, everything you've heard
about drummers is complete shit.

496
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,112
You mean they don't
spontaneously combust?

497
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,363
No.

498
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,741
Only sometimes.

499
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,857
Any more questions?

500
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,655
Jesus. Oh, my God.

501
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,291
Hello.

502
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,377
Who are you?

503
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,724
You know anything about this dog, Tam?

504
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,069
You want some breakfast, Tam?

505
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,656
Tam?

506
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:30,353
How goes the opus?
Fine, Nicholas, just fine.

507
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,942
It's his most obscure
novel, The Well-Beloved.

508
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,069
Most people have never
even heard of it.

509
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:42,282
It's about a young guy of 20 who falls
in love with a beautiful young woman.

510
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:46,119
Then when he's 40, he meets the woman's
daughter and he falls in love with her.

511
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,372
And finally, when he's 60,
he meets her granddaughter.

512
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,957
He doesn't.

513
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,544
Yeah. Falls in mystical love.

514
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,005
Hardy was the same in his life too.

515
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,508
Even as he aged,
he only had eyes for young women.

516
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,678
It's like, in one essential way,
he never grew up.

517
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,263
In his trousers. Ha.
Yeah.

518
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,141
He was still at it in his 80s,
you know.

519
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,518
Snow on the rooftop,
fire in the cellar.

520
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,355
Ha-ha.
Why won't it come for you, Glen?

521
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,815
The way you talk about it
is so engaging.

522
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,734
Do you wanna try?

523
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,987
Well, there's an academic style,
you know?

524
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:24,741
Who are you writing for?
Who's your ideal reader?

525
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,994
If wrote the way you spoke,
you'd make me want to read Hardy.

526
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,746
Really?
Yeah.

527
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,999
If you wrote like you were talking
to a friend. Try it again.

528
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,854
No, no, no.
It's not as if I'm avant-garde.

529
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:58,817
I simply pander to popular taste.
Your books are far more than that.

530
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,112
Just airport fodder. I think
I write them in my sleep sometimes.

531
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,030
I wish I wrote so well awake.

532
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,617
Your prose are so economical,
so vivid, like the greats.

533
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,411
Like Raymond Chandler.
Come on.

534
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,621
Graham Greene.
I'm just earning a crust.

535
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,873
You created Inchcombe.

536
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,459
If only he were real.
He's my kind of man.

537
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,880
Yes. Sophisticated, jaded,
but so vulnerable.

538
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,050
Cynical, but a man of total integrity.

539
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,469
My books don't say anything
remotely profound.

540
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:32,726
I can't pretend to be an intellectual,
not like the professor here,

541
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:36,980
illuminating our ignorance
with his critical glow.

542
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,275
I love prose. I turn a decent plot.
That's pretty much it.

543
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,527
- Excuse me.
- People like crime fiction,

544
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,655
because no matter how violent
or shocking, it comforts them.

545
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,408
Secretly, Nicholas hates all this.

546
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,827
These crime weekends
really take it out of him.

547
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,620
... In my case, a jaded doctor.

548
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,913
Let me help.

549
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,915
Well, they need dusting with this.

550
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,500
Restoring order to...

551
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,544
I went to my room today,

552
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,089
and I wrote for three hours.
The time, it just vanished.

553
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,342
That's great. That's brilliant.

554
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,220
I feel like a man who's just
passed a gargantuan stool.

555
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:12,015
Oh, super.

556
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,101
Sprig of mint on top.

557
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:18,980
Of course, my life isn't like
that, so I just make stuff up. Ha-ha.

558
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,943
The real secret of being a writer
is learning how to lie,

559
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:27,030
because that's what storytellers are,
thieves and liars.

560
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:31,868
"The basis of all excellence is truth."
Samuel Johnson.

561
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,880
<i>I met a girl on a farm
Her name was Tamara</i>

562
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,298
Ben, I'm trying to write.

563
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,676
<i>I wanted to write her a song
But one thing caused me alarm</i>

564
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,303
Please, Ben, it's a new story.

565
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,764
<i>Her name didn't rhyme
With anything</i>

566
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,974
<i>Not a single thing
I wanted to sing</i>

567
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,143
It comes from my heart,
it's about my mom and dad.

568
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,688
<i>All she wants to do is type
It's making me want a little bite</i>

569
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:06,111
<i>So cook me pasta carbonara
Because I'm ravenous, Tamara</i>

570
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,447
<i>Then shag me
Wearing your tiara</i>

571
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,429
Andy.

572
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,889
Let me dog in, will you?

573
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,016
Cheers, mate.

574
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,656
He must like kissing plastic.
He doesn't really love her.

575
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,867
He's just on the rebound
from losing Fran.

576
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,370
Numbing his pain
with loads of empty rampant sex.

577
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,705
What he really needs...

578
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,041
Is a 15 year old from Ewedown?
So? Stranger things happen.

579
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,378
He's only 10 years older,
and that's nothing. If he met me...

580
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,922
If he just met me...
It'd be love, right?

581
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,884
Yeah. But I'd settle for sex.

582
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,889
Cooer, in your parents' bedroom?
Still, I suppose being an exhibitionist

583
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,391
is part of his job,
strutting about on stage.

584
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,727
He doesn't strut. He's a drummer.

585
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,854
He sits on his ass.

586
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,024
He's very good-looking, isn't he?
Poppy YouTubed him.

587
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,984
We both got quite hot and bothered.

588
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,904
Is that his car? The yellow Porsche.
Yep.

589
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,740
Yeah, a bit brash,
vrooming through the village.

590
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:37,827
Fancy our Tamara bagging
a bona fide rock star.

591
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:43,166
She was such an ugly duckling.
She must be thrilled to bits.

592
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,148
We're not open for another hour.

593
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,942
Good.

594
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,205
I mean, she used to be so funny.
So human.

595
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,041
What does she see in that London knob?

596
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:29,420
He even wears fucking make-up.
How did she get so shallow?

597
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:34,926
Andy, are you really
going on about her now?

598
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,637
Where are your manners?

599
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,097
I'm sorry.

600
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:43,476
Bide your time, you big prick.

601
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:50,984
Oh, Ben.

602
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,997
Come here, you wretched beast!

603
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,667
Stinking animal!

604
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,670
Filthy hound!

605
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,803
Fuck soup.

606
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,221
Here.

607
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,349
What's this?
What does it look like?

608
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,186
Ben.

609
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,689
Which finger?

610
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,567
Wherever you want.

611
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,364
That one's nice.

612
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,450
Stick it on that one.

613
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:46,456
Those girls could have aborted.
Calm down, Penny. I'll sort him out.

614
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,958
It beats me why you people
want to live in the country.

615
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:53,046
You have no sense of responsibility.
It's not our dog.

616
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,882
Hello, Penny. How's tricks?

617
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,885
Oh, Nicholas.
You're looking good. Terrific coat.

618
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,971
What, this old thing?
You look like royalty.

619
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,850
Well, I try.
Can't wait for your next book.

620
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,852
Inchcombe's such a sauce pot.

621
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,937
Giles always says,
"What are you reading, Penny?

622
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,856
You've got steam
coming out of your ears."

623
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,991
What's the ring saying, Ben?

624
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:28,581
"Hello, I'm a ring.
Will you marry me?"

625
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,419
What?

626
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,588
I didn't know.

627
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,924
Didn't know what?

628
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,677
That you're in love with me.

629
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:46,516
The ring is saying,
"I'm platinum with a long guarantee.

630
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,725
Will you marry me?"

631
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,771
Yes.

632
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,614
- What?
- Is Tamara there?

633
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,366
She is being proposed to.

634
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:18,715
There are writers here trying to write.

635
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,639
Hello.

636
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:31,394
This is, a Buff Orpington.
He's a bit peaky today.

637
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,647
They're not great layers,
but they're very decorative. Heh.

638
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,650
We're, um...
We're fully organic here.

639
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:43,156
Though, I like to think our champion
product is, the written word. Heh-heh.

640
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,950
The famous Ben.

641
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,494
Swipe, eh?

642
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,956
No, Swipe's over.
I thought the whole world knew that.

643
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,916
It wasn't on Newsnight, no.

644
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,294
Ben's engaged to Tamara.
Isn't that lovely?

645
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,504
He'd just popped the question
when I rang.

646
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,506
And she said yes?

647
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,593
We're delighted for you both.

648
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,015
Why is he on a fucking chain?

649
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,309
He was out of control.

650
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,478
How would you like to be chained up?

651
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:17,356
He was chasing livestock.
He could have got shot.

652
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,736
They shoot him,
I'll fucking shoot them.

653
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,572
Unbelievable.

654
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,785
Here, pooch.
I think the word is gobshite.

655
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,828
I hope he makes her happy.

656
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,206
It's hard for girls
when their dads walk out.

657
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:36,042
Gives them bad taste in men.

658
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,877
What's that supposed to mean?

659
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,172
Just saying Tamara's father
left when she was a girl and...

660
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,591
That is 10-pence psychology.

661
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,219
You don't know
what you're talking about.

662
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,764
Poor little man.

663
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,705
"My Buff Orpingtons."
"The written word."

664
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,707
What a fucking freak.

665
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,918
It's a shame the ring doesn't fit.

666
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,129
Why didn't you bring one of mine
along when you bought it?

667
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,590
I didn't know you then, did l?

668
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:28,344
So when did you buy it?

669
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,099
Was it for someone else?

670
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,602
You bought it for Fran, didn't you?

671
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,937
So?

672
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,273
It's yours now.

673
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,235
She never wore it. She didn't want it.

674
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,029
Did you ask her to marry you?
Just as a gesture,

675
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,116
when she started seeing Steve.
That backfired.

676
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,869
Look, it's you I wanna marry now.

677
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,453
The ring... The ring doesn't matter.

678
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,747
The ring's just
a consumerist piece of zinc.

679
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,000
What matters is that I love you.

680
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,877
Do you?

681
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,753
Yes.

682
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,592
With my whole heart.

683
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,177
And all the other stuff.

684
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,224
Like me brain, me entrails.

685
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,770
Me pancreas.

686
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,607
It all wants to marry you.

687
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:29,822
She wondered if you had a delivery
date in mind. I said Easterish.

688
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,283
Mind that cocoa, it's hot.

689
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,535
There's a few invites.
I'll pop them there.

690
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,787
You just tick the ones
you want to go to.

691
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:41,709
And, Tim wants to know if you'll do
your Christmas signing in Hadditon.

692
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:45,171
I know he's always ungrateful,
but I think it's so important

693
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,049
to keep these little bookshops open,
don't you?

694
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,141
Come in soon, my love.

695
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,630
Look at that cellulite.

696
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,050
She been sitting on a bead car seat
or what?

697
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,886
"Her latest tattoo count was nine,

698
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:39,392
including a Sumatran tiger
and 'eternity' written in Sanskrit."

699
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,937
She'll be getting a bar code
done next, right across there.

700
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,899
And Judy Garland's face
right on there.

701
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,070
Nice baby, though.

702
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,072
I'd like one that color.

703
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,911
Shut the fuck up.

704
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,164
That Ryan's a dick.
I think he's cute.

705
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,084
No, you don't. Would you snog him?

706
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:09,755
Maybe.
Be like having a slug in your mouth.

707
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,049
Shit.

708
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,761
Shut up, fat arse. It ain't funny.

709
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,388
Ben.
Ben?

710
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,432
Come on, let's do some messing.

711
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,275
What about you, Glen? Sorry.
Where will you be?

712
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,777
In London
with a collection of spare academics.

713
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:35,281
We'll be decking the halls
in our own erudite way.

714
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,532
I'll miss our chats.

715
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,119
Yeah. I've been in a state
of writerly bliss these past weeks.

716
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:43,164
I hope I get to come back.
Me too. We'd love to have you.

717
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,167
You know, these are the best
mince pies I've ever had.

718
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,837
If it were possible
to have an orgasm from food,

719
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,298
these mince pies would do it.

720
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,258
Golly. Heh.

721
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,137
Fuck.

722
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,144
She keeps this here for Andy.

723
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,522
What if she's got an alarm?
Soon find out.

724
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:13,611
What if they come back?
If you're too chicken, go home.

725
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,563
What the fuck are we doing here?
It's kind of research.

726
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,233
I want to write about them.
They're funny.

727
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,443
Come on, Ben.

728
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:58,781
2001 was the best year.
I just sold my last three cases.

729
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,493
It's a perfect wine for the price.
Besides, I want to show you off.

730
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,954
What am I, arm candy?

731
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,665
More like arm fungus with that face.

732
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:12,920
I got her this gorgeous
Rajasthani Ghagra skirt.

733
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,214
Divine.

734
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,466
She'll probably loathe it. Ha-ha.

735
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,718
But if she does, I'll have it.
Glen.

736
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,720
Hi.
Meet Ben. Ben, Glen.

737
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,430
Hi, Ben.
Ben's my fiancé.

738
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:24,890
You're getting married?
Uh-huh.

739
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,726
Okay. Beautiful dress,
magazine photo shoot.

740
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,979
Everything
the aspiring novelist needs.

741
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,566
I knew you'd be pleased.
Have a mince pie? No.

742
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,901
Congratulations.

743
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,864
Can we get the fuck out of here?
Wait.

744
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,077
In Field of Tares,
you made Fred a corporal,

745
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:48,372
but there's no such thing
in the Royal Artillery.

746
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,749
They call them bombardiers.

747
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,752
Thank you for that.
Very good.

748
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,173
Sorry.

749
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,258
Hello.
Tamara.

750
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,094
Would you make that out for Ben?

751
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,055
To Ben.
My fiancé.

752
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,434
We're getting married in the summer.

753
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,102
So I hear.

754
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:20,863
My heartiest commiserations, Tamara.

755
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,533
Merry Christmas, Nichol-arse.

756
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,956
Casey, look.

757
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,001
The sticks.

758
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,796
No, don't touch.

759
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,053
Pour Homme.

760
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,599
Smells like men.

761
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:53,437
Live the dream, Case.
Live the dream, Jode.

762
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,688
His boots.

763
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:58,150
<i>This is a call for a domestic dispute</i>

764
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,987
<i>She's got me in the corner
And she's put in...</i>

765
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,950
Ben.

766
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,662
Oh, my God.

767
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,584
Look, stop going on about it.

768
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:19,213
I've invested a lot of time
into this house.

769
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:22,675
Why don't you sell it, then?
Because I've started writing.

770
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,927
You can write anywhere.

771
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,971
Yes, we've done it.

772
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,686
No, Ben, this is proper.
It's not just stuff for the paper.

773
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:37,147
It's about my teens,
and it's actually working for me here.

774
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:40,317
I'm glad it's memory lane for you,
but it's doing my fucking head in.

775
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:43,445
I want some London.
Some noise, some urban.

776
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,615
I've had enough.
Are you with me or what?

777
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,992
Of course, I'm with you.

778
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:51,203
It's depressing here. It's boring.

779
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,332
And every time I look out the
window, I see Andy Cobb's arse.

780
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,334
What's that about?

781
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,758
Oi!

782
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,970
Tammy says you got Christmas geese.

783
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,680
Yep.

784
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,143
We're leaving, thank fuck.

785
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,729
Well, give us one then.

786
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,439
Right now?

787
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,399
Yeah.

788
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,361
That one's spare. Help yourself.

789
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,696
You having a laugh?

790
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,073
What?
It's fucking alive.

791
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,993
I suppose you'd better kill it then.

792
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,079
How?

793
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,085
Gently put its head down there.

794
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:43,339
Quick in the back of skull with this.
Pluck it while it's warm.

795
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,884
Little pot to catch all the blood.

796
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,011
You enjoy that?

797
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,180
No.

798
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,433
But in my low-wage economy,
this flock's worth a lot.

799
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,856
You are one sick fuck, Andy.

800
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,525
Grow up.
What, mate?

801
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,945
I said, grow up.

802
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,947
Little drummer boy.

803
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,634
Tam phoned this morning.

804
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,553
Told me to finish the house.

805
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:36,141
Goes on the market in the spring,
and that's it. Over.

806
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,979
Why does the asshole
always get the girl?

807
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,526
Come on, or you'll miss that train.

808
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,423
Andy.

809
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:12,010
So, what about this shed?
Am I dismantling it or mending it?

810
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,720
Hang on.

811
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:21,103
I don't know. The shed.

812
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,604
What do you think?

813
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,607
I recommend preserving it.

814
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,192
Really?

815
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,363
Always useful, a good shed.

816
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,993
Well, then keep it.

817
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,344
Classy job, Uncle Andy.

818
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:58,557
It's like, transformed.

819
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,642
Ben won't like this.

820
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,811
Bit boring.

821
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,064
Bit old folks.

822
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,067
I like those curtains. And I like that.

823
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:12,237
No, don't like those lamps,
or that paper.

824
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:15,365
I'd have gold leaf embossed
all round there,

825
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,576
and a wall of flamingo.

826
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:21,663
Ben would like that.
That's a lovely chair.

827
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,750
What's under here?

828
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,137
I'd have a bead curtain.

829
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:43,101
And the bathroom needs to be darker,
like deep chocolate or velvet plum.

830
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:46,605
And I'd bathe in scented oils.

831
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:53,320
And then I'd be ready for Ben.

832
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:58,700
It won't just be a shag, Case.
It'll be an event.

833
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:04,498
I'll be wearing, like, a gossamer
shirt and a bra set, Prada.

834
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,750
And he'll be wearing a black T-shirt.

835
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,130
And it'll be all taut over his buff bod.

836
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:16,426
And underneath,
Calvin Klein boxers, black.

837
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:21,682
And he'll have a tattoo of my name,
and lush pecs.

838
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:24,977
And I'll smell of Allure by Chanel.

839
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:30,482
And he tries to resist me
but I'm a vision.

840
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,279
But also respectful.

841
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:38,824
And my V plates will melt
into nothing.

842
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:42,661
Are you listening?

843
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,122
I like this.
What?

844
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,333
There's this bit where Tamara's dad
takes her out for dinner,

845
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:51,628
and she thinks it's some big treat,
but what he's doing, right,

846
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:55,465
is telling her that he's leaving them,
and she... Right, she's gutted.

847
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:59,011
She yaks up her food into her napkin
and puts it on his plate.

848
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:02,389
So?
It's painful.

849
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:07,519
But funny.
It's about her, Plastic Fantastic.

850
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:12,941
Jode, she's sad.
Sad? She's a lucky cow.

851
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,198
I've been re-reading
Inchcombe Etherised,

852
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,242
one of Nicholas's early books.

853
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:26,371
There's a character, Theo,
who's an adulterer.

854
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:32,210
And Theo has a list of golden rules
called Lulling the Spouse.

855
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:37,507
"To allay suspicion," he says,
"you must first arouse it."

856
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,177
Nicholas rang me earlier
to say he was going to be late home.

857
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,680
Yeah, I just bumped into
Raoul and Celia.

858
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:46,391
I said, "That's nice."

859
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,603
And thought, "Have you?"

860
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,897
And I couldn't shake the suspicion.

861
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,858
So after an hour, I phoned Raoul.

862
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,029
Hello? Yeah, he's right here.

863
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,990
And he put Nicholas
straight on the line.

864
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,076
Hello.

865
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:08,080
He's been telling the truth a lot
recently.

866
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:11,166
Is he lulling me?

867
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:19,633
I might remind him
that in Inchcombe Etherized,

868
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:23,553
Theo's wife runs him through
with a carving knife.

869
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,945
What are you doing?
Just messing.

870
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,947
I got three valentines.

871
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,866
One from Mom,
one from that peanut Ryan,

872
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,952
and a mystery one from Ben.

873
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,413
I sent you that.

874
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,165
Is that theirs?

875
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,459
It's my mom's.
They don't drink this shit.

876
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:57,170
Come upstairs
and look at what I'm doing.

877
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:02,968
I've got into her e-mails.
We have to get Ben to come back.

878
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,470
I'm sending him a valentine.

879
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,472
No, you're not.
From her address.

880
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,142
Then he'll think it's from Tamara,
you dipshit.

881
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,519
But I know it'll be from me.

882
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:16,064
Hot love.

883
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,650
Oh, God. Jody.

884
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,446
"Contacts." Where are you, Ben?

885
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,323
There's that bloke my mom works for,
Nicholas Hardiment.

886
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,993
Let's put him on. Who else?

887
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,329
Uncle Andy.
Andy Cobb.

888
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,708
Come to Winnards Farm.

889
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:40,756
I'll give you the biggest shagging
of your life.

890
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,258
Love, Tamara. Kiss, kiss, kiss.

891
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:47,179
Don't ever, ever send that.
I just did.

892
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,683
What the fuck is this?

893
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,270
"Come to Winnards Farm,

894
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,442
and I'll give you
the biggest shagging of your life."

895
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:04,112
"I'll give you the biggest shagging
of your life."

896
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,283
Are you listening to me?

897
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,287
Ben, will you stop drumming?
I didn't write that e-mail.

898
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,830
Why don't you believe me?

899
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,499
When Fran started
fucking Steve Culley,

900
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,918
at least she had the decency
not to tell the whole world.

901
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:19,461
What's that supposed to mean?

902
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:24,883
She must want a foursome or something.

903
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,386
You fancy a foursome
with Nicholas Hardiment?

904
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:29,971
Bugger that.

905
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,556
What was she thinking?

906
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,726
Well, maybe she's trying
to make you jealous.

907
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,437
Or maybe she's trying
to make the boyfriend jealous.

908
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:40,732
Or maybe she's just trying
to give him a really big hint

909
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,526
that she's not getting enough.

910
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,904
Or maybe she's just a bit kinky.
Or maybe she's crazy.

911
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,949
Or maybe she was off her face.

912
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,200
She was pissed.

913
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,744
I wasn't
pissed or depraved or anything.

914
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,079
It's okay. It's okay.

915
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:57,165
Can you go look at the house?
To make sure no one's been in.

916
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,084
No problem.
Thanks.

917
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,585
Ben's really pissed off.

918
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:02,921
He's massively got the hump.
Have l?

919
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,882
I've just asked Andy
to have a look at Winnards.

920
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,385
I've got to go, I'm sorry.

921
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,262
Are you a fucking idiot?
What?

922
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:13,932
Are you thick? Isn't it obvious who wrote
that e-mail? That tosser Andy Cobb.

923
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,309
Andy wouldn't do that.
Making himself cozy in your house,

924
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:19,020
going through your stuff.
Probably got a pair of your pants on.

925
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,856
Bet it was him who nicked
my black T-shirt.

926
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,733
Of course, he didn't.
That's it, jumping to his defense.

927
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:26,736
He hasn't done anything.
Boss. Boss.

928
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,615
What are you doing?

929
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,993
You know Fran's having a baby.

930
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,246
She wanted to see me.
I wasn't going to, but now,

931
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,623
why not?

932
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,793
Come on, Boss, let's go for a crap.

933
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:46,381
Come on, mom, she's just stirring shit.
Tamara's always done that.

934
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:50,051
Yes, but why?
You know how subversive she is.

935
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:54,014
She once sent me a valentine
from Prince Harry and I believed it.

936
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:56,892
It's her sense of humor.
She likes causing trouble.

937
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,437
At school, she used to give us
first-years tips on how to shoplift.

938
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,814
She taught you how to shoplift?

939
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:06,359
Mom, she's marrying Ben Sergeant.

940
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:08,612
Why would she look at an old git
like Dad?

941
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,697
I just don't get the joke.

942
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,158
And why is your father on the e-mail?
And Andy?

943
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,202
It's so tasteless.
Help me out with these, would you?

944
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,496
I have to work on
my thesis on the Taliban.

945
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,457
Taliban, I know.

946
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:28,715
What do you make of that e-mail
from Tamara?

947
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,717
Don't make any sense.

948
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:34,596
That London boyfriend's trying
to fuck her up. That's my theory.

949
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,973
She could do so much better.

950
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,225
I couldn't agree more.

951
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,609
It's Ben.
"Who's the Daddy?"

952
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,986
"Steve Culley and Fran Redmond

953
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:52,989
recently announced
they were expecting.

954
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:57,953
But in a valentine-tryst shocker,
Fran is snapped with ex Ben Sergeant.

955
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,913
Ben and Fran, we say, 'Get a room."'

956
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:03,458
He's back with Fran?
After you sent that e-mail, Jode.

957
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,710
No way. No way.

958
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,381
There's Plastic.

959
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:13,551
Oh, my God, what have I done?
What have you done?

960
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,387
What if Ben's dumped her?

961
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,391
What if he never comes back?

962
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,669
I'll never see Ben again
and it's all my fault.

963
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,422
What's all your fault?
None of your business.

964
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:53,508
I'm bloody sick of you looking
like a wet weekend.

965
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:54,926
Who's Ben?
No one.

966
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,511
What have you done?
Nothing.

967
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,639
You in trouble?
No, leave me alone.

968
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:02,267
You take care with boys, Jody.

969
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,853
You know what can happen.

970
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:07,772
What can happen?

971
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:12,318
What can ever, ever happen
in a place like this?

972
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:23,955
Hello. I thought you were in London
with Ben from Swipe.

973
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:27,625
I'm looking for Andy.
Well, he's not up at Stonefield.

974
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,920
So where's this shag
you've been offering me?

975
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,630
Fuck off.
Come on. I saw that e-mail.

976
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:34,132
Well, I didn't send it.

977
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,803
And I wouldn't shag you if you were the
last man left after a nuclear winter.

978
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,264
I'll come round tomorrow then,
about 3?

979
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:44,142
Drop dead, you smug prick.

980
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,189
Watch out.

981
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:43,701
Yeah, I'll probably stay at the
library another hour or two.

982
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,037
Yeah.

983
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:50,708
Yeah, just checking some law reports.

984
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:54,045
You're a marvel.

985
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,173
Okay.

986
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:15,441
Hello.

987
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,696
So,

988
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,073
Nicholas.

989
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,585
You can tell me to leave.

990
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:39,632
You can throw me right out.

991
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:46,472
Just say the word,

992
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:49,601
and I'll go.

993
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,132
Do you smoke after sex?

994
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,967
I don't know, I've never looked.

995
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,473
I used to watch you out of my window,

996
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:31,351
helping your daughter
skateboard up the lane.

997
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:34,312
Bit of an obvious crush, wasn't it?

998
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:38,650
Is that why I'm here?
To expurgate the crush?

999
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:40,318
I don't know.

1000
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,403
Or as revenge on your ex?

1001
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,615
I don't know, Nicholas.

1002
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:46,991
Why are you here?

1003
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:49,869
I should have thought
that was obvious.

1004
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:56,292
Since you climbed over that stile
in the summer,

1005
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:59,963
I haven't thought about
very much else.

1006
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:09,764
When can we do this again?
What about Beth?

1007
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,183
Beth and I have this kind of open...
Bullshit.

1008
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,645
Thursday?
Isn't life complicated enough?

1009
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:18,022
Don't put me in your column.

1010
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,942
In your dreams.

1011
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,869
Structure can be so sterile, can't it?

1012
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,205
I always think of it
as a 3-dimensional...

1013
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,207
Here he is.

1014
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:40,753
Oh, poor you. Was it awful?
I was starting to worry.

1015
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:45,133
Bloody terrible. Didn't move
till well past Chiswick, but look.

1016
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,052
I popped into Fortnum's.
My favorite teas.

1017
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:55,059
Oh, my goodness, you feel like my buzzy
toothbrush just after I've charged it up.

1018
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:58,730
You should go to London more often.
Well, maybe I will.

1019
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:02,483
Sorry, everybody. Traffic was a pig.
Do carry on. What have I missed?

1020
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:05,903
Well, I'm trying this magic realist bit
at the end of Chapter 3.

1021
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:08,406
That sounds very innovative.
You think so?

1022
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:11,868
Yes. I think I've always been waiting
for the, magic realist crime novel.

1023
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:16,247
Wuthering Heights, it's
kind of Angel of the North.

1024
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:33,598
So after two years of radio silence,
I contact my editor,

1025
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:37,852
and she loves... I mean, she loves
the chapters I did in the fall.

1026
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,605
Oh, Glen.

1027
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:42,899
I tried writing at the library

1028
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:46,444
but I could feel that awful paralysis
descending again.

1029
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:50,782
I missed everything that I've been,
you know, finding here.

1030
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:53,284
Oh, my God.

1031
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:56,245
It's so beautiful.

1032
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,122
Well, I'm very glad you've come back.

1033
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,124
Yeah, in a few solid weeks...

1034
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:02,460
Holy cow!

1035
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,339
Idiots!

1036
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,299
Morons!

1037
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:16,099
Hey, writers, let's egg
the self-regarding sacks of shit.

1038
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:19,310
It's half term, they're just bored.

1039
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:24,524
There's this theory that Hardy
gave his wife syphilis, you know.

1040
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:27,485
No evidence, but the symptoms fit.
Poor woman,

1041
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:31,406
she starts to get eccentric and then
she moves her bed up to their attic.

1042
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:32,615
The bastard.

1043
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:35,827
Meanwhile, Hardy falls in love with
a woman 39 years younger than him.

1044
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:39,789
I don't believe it.
Yeah, he was 65 and she was 26.

1045
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,500
Geoff.
Glen.

1046
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,168
Henry James?
Thomas Hardy.

1047
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:47,338
That's it, a Hardy book.
Coming well?

1048
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:50,091
Yes, actually.
He gave his wife syphilis.

1049
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,301
Jolly good.

1050
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,389
He's completely distracted.

1051
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,516
He's up and down to London
all the time.

1052
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:01,853
This latest Inchcombe's
taking everything he's got.

1053
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,647
It's really preying on him.

1054
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:08,568
Is it any good?
Because I keep changing things

1055
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:09,777
and...

1056
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,161
It's brutally candid.

1057
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:22,457
You lay yourself completely bare.

1058
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:30,548
It's a bit over-written.
It needs a good edit, but,

1059
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:33,634
it's very moving.

1060
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,471
Thank you.

1061
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,389
So,

1062
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:41,058
have I done my duty?

1063
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,060
Admirably.

1064
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,563
Now do I get my treat?

1065
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:49,901
You are so cheesy.

1066
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:59,076
Zero Ben sightings
in two whole months.

1067
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:04,165
Last time I saw Plastic,
she looked like a minger.

1068
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,167
All red-eyed and gutted.

1069
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:08,169
Ben's a love rat.

1070
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,213
You gotta face it, she should move on.

1071
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,923
She's probably topped herself.

1072
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:16,552
I would, if Ben dumped me.
Jode, don't say that.

1073
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,596
What if she's done something?

1074
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,474
Like got in the bath
with her heated tongs?

1075
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:24,769
Like taken a stack of pills.
Think she might be lying there,

1076
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:27,688
all choked in vomit and drug froth?
That'd be dire.

1077
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:30,733
If we find her, we'll get in the papers.
Oh, my God.

1078
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:32,777
Rock chick dead at Winnards Farm.

1079
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:51,420
What's Uncle Andy doing here?

1080
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,977
Ass biscuits.

1081
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,488
No answer.

1082
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:20,992
She could've been there days.
She could be all putrid-like, rancid.

1083
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:23,160
Oh, no, gonna chuck.

1084
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:27,123
All bloated and all greeny.
Uncle Andy will find her by the smell.

1085
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:31,752
Andy.

1086
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,131
- Bollocks, she's alive.
- Haven't seen you for a while.

1087
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:38,009
Thought you might be ill
or something, or depressed.

1088
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:40,428
I've had my head down, writing.

1089
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:41,679
Come for a drink.

1090
01:16:42,222 --> 01:16:44,432
Let's lighten up.
I'd love to, but,

1091
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,603
I'm kind of on one with my writing,
and...

1092
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,480
Can we do it soon, though?

1093
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:55,192
I really would like to.
Just not right now.

1094
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,486
Sure.

1095
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,874
What is he doing here?

1096
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,001
He just came by on the off-chance.

1097
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:14,045
Off-chance of what?

1098
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:16,631
Something about the roofing
for the shed.

1099
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,306
Do you think he's in with a chance?
No way.

1100
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:28,476
Why not? He's fit. I'd do him.
Jody, he's my uncle.

1101
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,646
She'd be mad not to have him.
Bet he goes like a train.

1102
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:40,071
Let's go, my knickers are wet.

1103
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:42,365
Wait, wait.

1104
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,996
Oh, my God.

1105
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,251
Nicholas, go.

1106
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:05,680
"Prolific author
of intelligent crime novels."

1107
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:08,766
Fucking D-list.
How could she do that after Ben?

1108
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:12,103
He's not even a proper celeb.
Maybe she's numbing the pain.

1109
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,312
Trying to tear love...

1110
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,147
Shut up, Case.
She's just a slag.

1111
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:18,109
She went out and pulled a married man.

1112
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:21,904
Like that bitch
that went off with my dad.

1113
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:26,534
I know who I feel sorry for.

1114
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:33,499
Then there'll be the divorce
and acrimony,

1115
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:36,419
and Beth's world will fall apart.
Yeah.

1116
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:40,715
But maybe one day,
she'll put the bitterness behind her,

1117
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,133
and find a new love.

1118
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,052
Don't be daft. She's old, you sop.

1119
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,971
See?

1120
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,474
That's D-list's car.

1121
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:55,312
This is where he hides his car
when he goes to shag Plastic.

1122
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,524
Yeah. Dirty git.
Big old turd.

1123
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:02,319
He's a rotten cheater.
Like my dad.

1124
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:06,490
Come on, Case. Let's fuck him up.

1125
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,497
Shit salad.

1126
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:19,962
Oh, poor you.
What a drag.

1127
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:21,589
Yes, it's a frightful bore.

1128
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,382
I'll hold off on the paella then.

1129
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,468
You're a marvel. See you soon.

1130
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:27,261
Did you...?

1131
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,392
Beth, can I use the printer?

1132
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:37,354
Nicholas is stuck on the motorway
with a flat tire,

1133
01:19:37,814 --> 01:19:40,024
but I couldn't hear traffic,
just rooks.

1134
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,361
Sorry, um, did you want me
to read something?

1135
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:46,530
No. Can I use the printer?

1136
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:54,497
Nicholas, someone knows.

1137
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:57,666
Maybe we should...
Who cares?

1138
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:11,388
Casey, pop them. Pop them.

1139
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:19,104
Fucking bingo.

1140
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:26,111
Hello, Casey, how are you? Hello.

1141
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:28,364
All right.
Waiting for the bus?

1142
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,407
Bus got scrapped.
So it did.

1143
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:33,828
Well, hope it doesn't rain.

1144
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:38,457
Gutted for her.
Me too.

1145
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:41,627
Fat arse though, hasn't she?

1146
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:46,757
Send her the photo, Case.
I can't.

1147
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,968
Why not?
What if it ruins her life?

1148
01:20:49,135 --> 01:20:51,220
We gotta do something.
Plastic's an idiot.

1149
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:54,223
She fucked it up with Ben.
We fucked it up with Ben, Jode.

1150
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,186
It's like...

1151
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:04,608
We've gotta rescue her from D-list.

1152
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:35,639
Casey.
What?

1153
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:39,977
She's back in touch with him.
She's got an e-mail from Ben.

1154
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:43,480
"Tamara, Fran's baby has come."

1155
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:46,984
Case, he says it's a little brown girl
with curly black hair.

1156
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:48,569
Cute.

1157
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:52,823
"I think we can safely say
it's Steven Culley's, not mine.

1158
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:55,492
Truth is, I feel free.

1159
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,870
Gig in Paris for a few days.

1160
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:01,165
If I bring him down,
would you have Boss?"

1161
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:05,002
Yes. Yes, he's coming back.

1162
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,630
What are you doing?
Dear, Ben,

1163
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:11,508
I have found a reliable dog lover
in the village.

1164
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:13,552
Who?
Please call Jody,

1165
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:17,598
You can't send that.
On 07700-900-929.

1166
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,684
I'm getting him back down here!
For who? You?

1167
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:23,020
Why not me?
Are you mental?

1168
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:25,814
"Reliable dog lover"?
You're making a great big mess...

1169
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:28,359
I'm making something happen!

1170
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:30,527
Otherwise, my whole life will go by,

1171
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:33,072
and I'll be 34
and washed up like my mom.

1172
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:36,367
And no one decent
will ever even have snogged me.

1173
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:39,370
If you do this, you're on your own.

1174
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:41,705
Fuck off, then.

1175
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:44,500
You twat.

1176
01:22:47,879 --> 01:22:50,965
There's the festival brochure.
You're on in the Lanson marquee.

1177
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:53,884
And, um, I've marked a few bits,
in case you want to read.

1178
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:57,012
You're a marvel. Cheers.

1179
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,847
I could come with you.

1180
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:01,225
Don't. You hate festivals.

1181
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:04,353
But it's only Hadditon. I'll come.

1182
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:07,398
It'll be completely boring.
You'll hate it.

1183
01:23:07,565 --> 01:23:09,441
Stay here.

1184
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,092
Wanker! Right.

1185
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:38,637
Finished.

1186
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:41,640
I'm doing this cake in celebration.
Well done.

1187
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,142
Well, to Hardy.

1188
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:48,147
Yeah, even though I can't bear
the man for what he did to his wife.

1189
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:51,775
Thanks, Andy.
Just pop them over there.

1190
01:23:57,407 --> 01:24:00,034
How do I find out who sent this?

1191
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,916
It says "number withheld."

1192
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,379
Did you know?

1193
01:24:15,508 --> 01:24:17,801
I couldn't tell you.

1194
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:19,970
I'm sorry, Beth.

1195
01:24:26,269 --> 01:24:28,062
Her.

1196
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,397
Oh, my God.

1197
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:33,609
This is just...
This is just horrible.

1198
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:34,818
Right under my nose.

1199
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:36,820
It's so shitty.
God, I feel sick.

1200
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:39,823
So insulting. You do not deserve
to be treated like this.

1201
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:41,658
If you're kind to me, I'll cry.

1202
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:44,703
And I don't want to cry,
I must be very clear.

1203
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:47,581
If there's anything that I can do...

1204
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:50,084
I have to do it by myself.

1205
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:56,840
Come on. Come on, Beth.
Come on.

1206
01:24:57,008 --> 01:24:59,927
I trod in the sponge mix.

1207
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:09,103
Jody? This is Ben Sergeant.

1208
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:11,980
Yeah, that's right. I love dogs.

1209
01:25:12,565 --> 01:25:16,318
Yeah, so I'll see you
at Winnards Farm at 2:00.

1210
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:18,946
Yeah. Perfect.

1211
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:29,373
Andy.

1212
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:32,292
Hey, how are you?

1213
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:37,047
I wondered if you wanted
to go for that drink?

1214
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:40,384
I need a friend at the mo...
You and Nicholas Hardiment.

1215
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,761
That's a nice piece of work, isn't it?

1216
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:46,890
I get it from his point of view.
He's always been a cheating wanker.

1217
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:49,810
Loves having his cake and eating it.

1218
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:53,856
But since when did your standards
drop so low?

1219
01:25:54,023 --> 01:25:55,315
You could have anyone.

1220
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:58,235
All you have to do is bat your eyes.
Andy.

1221
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:02,322
I care a lot about Beth.
She helped me out when I was at rock bottom.

1222
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,032
I'm not going to split them up.

1223
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,993
It's just...
A bit of fun?

1224
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:09,079
It's none of your bloody business.

1225
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:13,750
Andy Cobb knows.
Cock pie. Has he told Beth?

1226
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:16,587
I don't know, but he might.
And I wouldn't blame him.

1227
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:18,213
I suppose it has to come out sometime.

1228
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:19,423
Does it?

1229
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:22,551
It's a good thing. Feels like a relief.
It means we can think about

1230
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,803
our plans for the future.
What future?

1231
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:27,514
I know it's been hard for you,
sharing me with Beth.

1232
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:29,808
But I'm yours now.
I'm gonna leave her.

1233
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:32,936
Mr. Hardiment. It's time.

1234
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:38,108
I want a new life with you.

1235
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:42,529
It's a nice dog, Mom.

1236
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:46,033
Well, I don't like having dog hair
and slobber all over the place.

1237
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,534
But I said yes.

1238
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:50,287
No dogs, no way, and that's final.

1239
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:54,583
You loser, I hate you!
You want to ruin my life!

1240
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:57,961
Live the dream, Jody.

1241
01:26:58,129 --> 01:26:59,713
Well, it all runs very smoothly.

1242
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:03,133
I start a book in the summer
and publish it the following spring.

1243
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:05,302
Bit of a factory, really.

1244
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:10,807
So you've finished Like The Night, which
is the 17th of the Inchcombe adventures.

1245
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:14,144
And we all assume
you're planning the next one already.

1246
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:16,063
Well,

1247
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:19,358
there isn't gonna be a next one.

1248
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:20,651
- No.
- What?

1249
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:22,986
Frankly,
I'm sick to death of Inchcombe.

1250
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:25,781
In fact, I'm about to kill him off.

1251
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:27,366
- No.
- He can't do that.

1252
01:27:27,533 --> 01:27:29,785
Well, I think
that's what we call in the trade,

1253
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:32,913
a bit of a bombshell,
for your fans here.

1254
01:27:33,456 --> 01:27:37,542
Yes, but I'm moving on
to fresh pastures.

1255
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:39,503
No.

1256
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,922
Inchcombe is about to meet
a very sticky end,

1257
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,175
and it's one murder
I'm really looking forward to.

1258
01:27:46,552 --> 01:27:49,972
Now, at this point, we should
get some questions, I think.

1259
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:53,934
And I'm...
Yes, there's a lady over there.

1260
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:02,276
You write a lot about adultery,
is that from personal experience?

1261
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:04,945
Madam,

1262
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,949
what a saucy question. Uh...

1263
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,702
But there's no need for an author's
work to be autobiographical...

1264
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:13,704
Why do you cheat persistently
on your wife?

1265
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:17,249
Who's that?

1266
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:24,840
Because she lets me.

1267
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:27,968
Tamara.

1268
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,263
Where...?
Nicholas, this has got to stop.

1269
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:33,640
You're right. I can't go on using her.
Lying to her.

1270
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,225
It won't be fun but I've gotta do it.

1271
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:38,145
I don't feel alive with Beth.
I haven't been living for years.

1272
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:41,356
She's smothered me like a blanket.
Nicholas, listen to me.

1273
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:45,277
It was fun,
but it's wrong and it's over.

1274
01:28:48,364 --> 01:28:51,033
I'm in love with you.
I'm sorry.

1275
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,576
No.

1276
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:56,204
No. No. No. You can't end it.
Tamara...

1277
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:58,415
Fuck supper!
Will you keep it down?

1278
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,001
My God, you're cold-hearted.
No, I'm not.

1279
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:03,962
You don't feel a thing, do you?
I do. I do feel.

1280
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:07,341
I feel like I'm blazing away inside
all the time.

1281
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:11,261
Why do I do these things?
What am I doing with you?

1282
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:15,724
There's someone else, isn't there?
For God's sake.

1283
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:18,602
Not the narcissist drummer?
Goodbye.

1284
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:20,479
It's that ignorant lunk, isn't it?

1285
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:23,523
That muscle-bound wastrel
Andy Cobb.

1286
01:29:23,983 --> 01:29:27,277
Andy Cobb is a far better man
than you.

1287
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:32,491
Go on.

1288
01:29:36,829 --> 01:29:40,582
Mr. Hardiment, will you sign this?
Imagine getting him to sign.

1289
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:43,251
I love your books.

1290
01:29:59,852 --> 01:30:01,812
Thank you.

1291
01:30:09,695 --> 01:30:11,488
Hello?

1292
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,993
It's Jody Long about the dog.

1293
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,749
Ben?

1294
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:29,840
Hello?

1295
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:34,318
Ben?

1296
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,702
Well, you gonna answer that?

1297
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:02,414
Jody, what are you doing
not fucking answering?

1298
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:10,213
Ben's dog is here. It's loose.
It means Ben must be up at Winnards.

1299
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,550
Boss!

1300
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:16,553
Dog minder?

1301
01:31:17,763 --> 01:31:22,058
You've been breaking in, sending
e-mails and fucking people off.

1302
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:26,730
Did you nick my black T-shirt?
I just wanted to meet you. Just once.

1303
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,983
Just to tell you stuff.
Stuff? What stuff?

1304
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,235
Like, I love you.

1305
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:35,405
I really, really love you.

1306
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:38,575
That's really nice.

1307
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:43,121
I used to lie awake
thinking about you being here.

1308
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:44,956
In Ewedown.

1309
01:31:45,124 --> 01:31:48,418
In the bum-hole of nowhere.

1310
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:52,172
When you left, I couldn't bear it.

1311
01:31:52,548 --> 01:31:55,884
I just wanted to make you come back.

1312
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:05,227
Do you still love me, Jody?
Even though I wanna lock you up?

1313
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:08,647
What would you do for me then?

1314
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:11,566
Would you do anything,
like a proper fan?

1315
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:15,153
Let's see then, shall we?

1316
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:18,447
I bet that bitch wants a baby.
Well, she'll find out.

1317
01:32:18,472 --> 01:32:19,672
Nicholas doesn't do children.

1318
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:21,785
He'll leave it all up to her.

1319
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:23,578
That'll age her.
Beth.

1320
01:32:23,746 --> 01:32:26,289
Suppose he discovers fatherhood?
They do, these men.

1321
01:32:26,457 --> 01:32:30,335
Second time around,
they get all nappy-happy.

1322
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:32,295
I was barely 20 when I got pregnant.

1323
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:35,799
I've never done anything. God.
Yes, you have. Look at this place.

1324
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:38,176
I've let him walk all over me.
Why? Why have I done that?

1325
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:39,719
I've wasted my life.

1326
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:41,680
No. What about the work
you've done here?

1327
01:32:41,847 --> 01:32:42,889
Work?
Yes.

1328
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:46,059
What, breeding goats?
Baking fucking biscuits?

1329
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:47,561
It's meaningless!

1330
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,438
Beth.

1331
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:53,733
When I was lost with my book,
you helped me more than you know.

1332
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:56,152
You asked me who I was writing it for.

1333
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:58,655
You.

1334
01:33:21,512 --> 01:33:23,305
Excuse me.

1335
01:33:26,058 --> 01:33:27,642
May I speak with my wife?

1336
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:31,104
No, you may not.

1337
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:35,108
Beth. Beth.

1338
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:38,653
It's over.

1339
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:41,281
I've finished it.

1340
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,700
She's been chasing me.

1341
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:46,161
I think there's something
unhinged about her.

1342
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:47,787
This wild crush.

1343
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:53,293
Ben Sergeant's bloody dog again.
Go on, get out.

1344
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:57,756
Back to that tart at Winnards Farm.
Go on. Bugger off!

1345
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:00,216
Beth.

1346
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:03,219
You know I'm sorry.

1347
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:07,057
I want you to leave. I want a divorce.

1348
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:09,225
No, you don't. Don't be ridiculous.

1349
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,478
Now, look...
And I want this place.

1350
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:13,396
You can't.

1351
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:17,359
Watch me. I will.

1352
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:22,781
That's it, lovely. Keep it going, keep it going.
Stop. Couple of sugars.

1353
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:26,284
Stir it.

1354
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:38,922
That is a very good cup of tea.
Which is lucky for you, Jody.

1355
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:40,131
Had it been shit,

1356
01:34:40,299 --> 01:34:42,884
I'd be on the phone to the extremely
scary local cops right now.

1357
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:44,427
Please don't tell my mom.

1358
01:34:44,595 --> 01:34:47,180
I know it's boring round here,
but for fuck's sakes.

1359
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:48,932
I'm gonna get out soon as I can.

1360
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:52,602
I'm gonna work in Vegas as a croupier.
Vegas or a cruise liner.

1361
01:34:53,562 --> 01:34:57,941
Aim high, Jody.
That's what I say. Aim high.

1362
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:06,616
Ben?

1363
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:12,455
You've had an infestation.
Of what?

1364
01:35:12,748 --> 01:35:14,374
Jody.

1365
01:35:35,646 --> 01:35:37,981
Hey, Greg!

1366
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:41,151
I want a word with you.
It's Glen, asshole.

1367
01:35:41,318 --> 01:35:43,987
You fucking devious bastard.

1368
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:46,448
I'm devious? I'm a bastard?

1369
01:35:46,615 --> 01:35:50,577
You think I haven't noticed
you've been worming your way in?

1370
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:55,415
You keep your hands off my wife,
you low-rent pedant.

1371
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:59,377
You've abused Beth long enough
with all of your goddamn lies.

1372
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:01,004
I want you out of my house.

1373
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:04,257
It's Beth's. She made this place.
And I fucking paid for it.

1374
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:06,760
I've given Beth all this.
What can you give her?

1375
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:10,972
I can give her integrity.
Obscure literary shit,

1376
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:12,557
not worth 10 pence.

1377
01:36:12,725 --> 01:36:16,519
You know, if I made my fortune
fantasizing about rapes and murders,

1378
01:36:16,687 --> 01:36:18,021
I wouldn't be so proud.

1379
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:21,524
You cretin.
Fuck you.

1380
01:36:22,067 --> 01:36:23,651
Beth will come to her senses.

1381
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:28,114
You need an income to run Stonefield,
and mine's bigger than yours.

1382
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:39,918
Get up, Nicholas, come on.
Let's talk about this like grown men.

1383
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:48,968
Oh, my God. Nicholas.

1384
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:50,553
Nic...

1385
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:53,181
Get up.

1386
01:37:01,398 --> 01:37:03,733
Nicholas, get up.

1387
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:06,736
Run. Come on. Get up.

1388
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:15,703
Nicholas. Nicholas.

1389
01:37:51,615 --> 01:37:53,366
It was you?

1390
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:56,661
It was you who sent the e-mail?

1391
01:37:56,829 --> 01:38:00,123
Jody's explained that she did it
out of a deep love for me.

1392
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:07,630
Tammy.
Ben.

1393
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:21,144
I think you should have this back.

1394
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:23,771
I'm sorry.

1395
01:38:25,190 --> 01:38:27,817
Jody! The dog!

1396
01:39:12,237 --> 01:39:16,157
Got him. The beast.

1397
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:46,229
Nicholas.

1398
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:52,151
God. Oh, God. Nicholas.

1399
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:54,070
Bitch. Brazen.

1400
01:39:54,863 --> 01:39:56,197
Brazen.
Beth.

1401
01:39:56,365 --> 01:39:59,951
That is brazen.
Beth, don't look! Please, don't look!

1402
01:40:04,123 --> 01:40:06,040
Nicholas?!

1403
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:13,423
No!

1404
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:17,593
No, but you can see it.
It's broken. It's smashed.

1405
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:22,724
No, I haven't, but it's obvious.

1406
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:28,229
Yes, his wife. Yes, she is.

1407
01:40:28,397 --> 01:40:31,149
Thank you. Thank you, I will.

1408
01:40:32,735 --> 01:40:34,777
They're on their way.

1409
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:38,448
Beth, help is coming.

1410
01:40:46,623 --> 01:40:48,541
It's broken.

1411
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:20,364
Tamara.

1412
01:41:21,992 --> 01:41:23,659
Listen.

1413
01:41:26,163 --> 01:41:28,331
I'm sorry.

1414
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:31,667
Come on.

1415
01:41:31,835 --> 01:41:34,253
Are you blaming yourself?

1416
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:37,673
It was an accident.

1417
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:55,358
I'd better get back up to Stonefield.

1418
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:59,487
Come with me. We'll get this sorted.

1419
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:07,328
Then get Ben
to take you back to London.

1420
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:10,540
I don't want to be with Ben.

1421
01:42:27,266 --> 01:42:29,600
Put it on the back seat right here.

1422
01:42:41,446 --> 01:42:42,446
What are you doing?

1423
01:42:42,614 --> 01:42:45,032
I figured it was best,
you know, that I take off.

1424
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:47,410
She doesn't want writers
around the place now.

1425
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:49,704
And police, autopsies, not my thing.

1426
01:42:49,872 --> 01:42:52,248
You can't run away.
I'm not running away.

1427
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:56,586
I've finished my book.
My time here is up. Destiny calls.

1428
01:42:56,753 --> 01:43:00,339
Beth is asking for you.
Really?

1429
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:02,925
She's on her own over there.

1430
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:08,181
Glen, she doesn't need a writer
around the place,

1431
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:10,766
she needs a man.

1432
01:43:19,651 --> 01:43:21,986
I'm so sorry.

1433
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:26,115
It was my fault. I let the dog go.

1434
01:43:26,283 --> 01:43:28,367
No. No.
I shooed him away.

1435
01:43:28,535 --> 01:43:31,787
The police said it was an accident,
but if I'd caught him, tied him up...

1436
01:43:31,955 --> 01:43:33,164
No, it wasn't your fault.

1437
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:36,542
What I don't understand is why was
Nicholas in that field anyway?

1438
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:39,170
He hated cows.
And when he saw them coming,

1439
01:43:39,338 --> 01:43:44,091
why didn't he get out of their way...?
Beth, I have to tell you that...

1440
01:43:56,647 --> 01:43:58,773
You live in the country.

1441
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:01,025
You share it
with those dangerous beasts,

1442
01:44:01,193 --> 01:44:03,945
and when they get scared, they run.

1443
01:44:04,112 --> 01:44:06,113
Like we do.

1444
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:09,158
Oh, Glen.

1445
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:14,580
Stay with me.

1446
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:51,450
Kind of suits you.
Don't say anything.

1447
01:44:51,618 --> 01:44:53,953
I always did like the old one.

1448
01:44:57,207 --> 01:45:00,126
You did it on purpose, didn't you?
What?

1449
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:03,337
Made this place so beautiful
I'd never be able to leave.

1450
01:45:03,505 --> 01:45:05,798
Been dying to get rid of you.

1451
01:45:07,092 --> 01:45:09,010
This is my house.

1452
01:45:09,761 --> 01:45:13,514
I was born in that room.
So you were.

1453
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:16,642
Welcome home.

1454
01:45:57,434 --> 01:45:58,893
Pap-pap me.

1455
01:45:59,644 --> 01:46:00,895
What?

1456
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:03,522
Pap-pap me.
