Oh, hello, Sleeping Beauty.

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,879
(Beth) God, l'm starving.
Any biscuits left?

8
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,399
l saved you the last Boaster.

- Nothing.

11
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,279
My camera battery's dead.

12
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,119
At the services can l use your phone
to take photos?

13
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,039
Yeah, sure, but why do they make you
take photos of the posters you put up?

14
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,399
- They say it's for the clients.
- They think you're a slacker, more like.

15
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,199
Oh, bollocks. Memory's full.
l'll have to delete some.

16
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,999

17
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,199
Look at that.

18
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,079
- What is it? l can't see it properly.
- lt's a photo of the stars.

19
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,639
Remember that night on the beach?
The brilliant sky?

20
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,119
- Why did you just call me a slacker?
- lt was a joke. Jesus.

21
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,959

22
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,599

24
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,479
- Stars. Lovely.
- Oh, my God ! You don't remember.

25
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,079
lt's just sky, Beth. You've seen one star,
you've seen them all.

26
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,679
- Should l delete these pictures, then?
- No!

27
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,839
No, don't be silly.

32
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,959
Hiya, it's me.

33
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,519
Look, l don't think

34
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,279

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,279
Cheers.

41
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,119
Have you got some petrol money?

- Yeah. Leo.

49
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,919
lt is his sister's birthday.
He'll be seeing if we're going.

50
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,879
He's a sniffer waiting for his chance.
What a cock.

51
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,439
- Zakes...
- What is he? About 40?

52
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,119
The only people who wear their mobiles
on their belts are dads or pricks.

53
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,359
He's not that bad.

54
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,719

- Lets you finish your book.

55
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,279
Yeah, l know.

56
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,719
(Laughs) You don't think
l can be a writer, do you?

57
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,199
l've never read
anything you've finished.

58
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,839
l'm not really feeling
my writing at the minute.

59
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,919
Don't you think you should put an effort
into it, even if you're not feeling it?

60
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,159
ls this about my writing or us?

61
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,039
- Do you really not remember the sky?
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

62
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,759
- Why are you going on about that?
- Because it upset me.

63
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,079
- You're not bothered about us.
- You know what? l am not doing this.

64
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,959
Do you realise it's a year
since you said we'd move in together?

65
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,839
And you haven't
even mentioned it since.

66
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,919
(Rap plays at loud volume)

67
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,239

(Sighs)

69
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,519
Where's the flask?

70
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,199
Oh.

71
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,919
Whoa.

72
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,639
(Tyres squeal)

73
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,719
(Horn blares)

74
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,359
Help!

75
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,559

in the back of that truck!

80
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,279
A naked fucking woman locked up
caged in the back of that truck!

81
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,799
(Zakes) What the fucking hell...?
(Beth) What are you on about?

82
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,959
(Zakes) That truck overtook us.
He pulled up there in front of us.

83
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,319
The shutter came up, and there was
a woman stood there, with no clothes on,

84
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,839
and she was screaming.

85
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,839
Jesus Christ.

86
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,199
Oh, my God.

94
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,679
Er, well, it was a woman.

95
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,679
She was tied-up, naked,
in the back of a white truck.

96
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,159
Yeah, my name's
Zakes - Zakes - Abbot.

101
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,879
(Sighs) They said they'll get someone

102
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,799
but l really think they need the plates.

103
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,439
- Ah, shit.
- Maybe we should go and get them.

104
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,999
- Are you mad?
- Zakes, we have to do something !

105
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,839

113
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,799
But l took a picture

Well, how?

127
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,519

They said not to get involved.

128
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,679

129

130
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,079

Zakes, flash him !

136
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,959
lt's our last stop.
We'd have to go round again.

137
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,399
We're not stopping
cos you have to put posters up?

138
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,759
This is my job, Beth.

139
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,079
Look, l've called the police.
Jesus, l even got out of the car.

140
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,159
To help her or because you were
pissed off with me?

141
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,159
You do things, but your priorities,
they're fucked up!

142
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,759
This isn't even
about the truck, is it?

143
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,359
This is about
what a fuck-up you think l am.

144
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,399
l'll finish my book
as soon as we get home.

145
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,479

to remember a sky.

146
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,599
We can move in together this evening,

Why have you come tonight?

148
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,839

with our relationship.

149
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,279
- Oh, like l never do anything.
- Not if you have to go out your way.

150

151
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,799
When? Oh, you saved me a biscuit.

- (Man) Hurry up!

168
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,319
(Laughter and jeering)

169
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,559
(Woman) 99p, please.
Thank you.

170
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,199
Next.

171
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,399
Next!

172
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,759
- That's 1 . 1 0, please.
- Yeah, thanks.

173
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,119
Beth, look at this.

174
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,679
- Zakes, l need to tell you something.
- No, hang on a minute.

175
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,239
This is the photo that l took
of the inside of that truck.

176
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,039
Now, give me your hand.

177
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,639
Just hold it still.

178
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,479
Look at that.
Yeah?

179
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,919
Well, it's proof. lt's a hand.
Someone was in the back of that truck.

180
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,159
- What, proof?
- Yeah.

181
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,359
What good is that now, Zakes?
That truck, it's miles away.

182
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,359
Zakes, you know, sitting here right now,
l've realised that the...

183
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,359
the only thing that is holding us together

184
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,279
is the time
we've spent together because...

185
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,999
we're not working.

186
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,759
l know that l'm partly responsible
for that, and l'm sorry, but...

187
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,959
where you're at now, it's...

188
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,519
it isn't good enough for me, Zakes.
l'm...

189
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,479
l'm sorry.

190
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,119
- l'll make my own way to Manchester.
- l can take you back.

191
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,559
l don't want you to, OK?

192
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,839
l r... l really...
l don't want that.

193
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,159
Beth. Beth, j...

194
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,359
l'll be waiting in the car!

195
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,039
Hi, Sarah, listen, it's me.

196
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,279
l know tonight's your party and all,
but, look, l need your help.

197
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,639
l've broken up with Zakes.

198
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,439
Can you pick me up
from Stanhope services on the M 1 ?

199
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,199
l-l don't have my phone on me,
but maybe l'll try you later.

200
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,879
(Phone beeps)

201
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,519
Let's see what the sniffer's
got to say.

202
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,719
Hello!

203
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,279
(Grunts)

204
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,399
- Whoa.
- (Dog barks)

205
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,639
What?

206
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,919
(Whistle)

207
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,559
(Man) When you've finished getting air,
go round the back.

208
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,839
Oh, shit.

209
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,279
(Ragged breathing)

210
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,799
Beth.

211
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,599
There she is.

212
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,999
Beth.

213
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,559
Oh. l'm sorry. Sorry.

214
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,319
Sorry.

215
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,039
Beth !

216
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,319
Beth, are you in here?

217
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,119
Look, l'm sorry, OK?

218
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,039
Beth. Beth.

219
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,999
- Aaargh !
- Sorry.

220
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,279
ls everything OK in here?

221
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,559
- Oi ! What's going on here?
- l was looking for my girlfriend.

222
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,279
- This might look like something else...
- He was spying on me! You pervert!

223
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,479
l'm looking for my girlfriend.
l can't find her.

224
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,159
Yeah. l get it.

225
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,799
Get back from the game all tanked up.
Your mates put you up to it? Very funny.

226
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,479
l'm the poster guy, right?
l put the posters up. Like this one, here.

227
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,799
l put the one of the car up, outside.
Here you are, look, here.

228
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,239
Get off! Argh !

229
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,159
- Don't move! l said don't move!
- For fuck's sake, l'm not. Jesus!

230
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,039
- Ronnie! Are you OK?
- Look, right, you've got it wrong.

231
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,999
l'm looking for my... Aaargh !
l'm looking for my girlfriend !

232
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,399
Jesus Christ!
Aaargh !

233
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,759
Argh ! Fuck, just take it easy!
You don't have to pull hard ! Fucking hell !

234
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,399
Argh, fucking hell !
All right. Take it easy!

235
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,799
- Yeah, yeah. l've heard.
- Jesus!

236
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,839
Ugh ! Jesus!

237
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,879
What's your problem? l was looking for
my girlfriend. You should be helping me!

238
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,199
Prick.

239
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,719
Oh, God, no.

240
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,439
Shit!

241
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,359
(Engine stalls)

242
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,639
What the fuck?

243
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,239
(Men cheer)

244
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,119
Mate, mate, stop!
Stop the car!

245
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,999
Sorry, love.
l've got to take your car!

246
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,159
(Whistles)

247
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,799
Woman driver
smacks into another car.

248
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,919
The driver gets out, and it's a dwarf.

249
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,039
So he says to the woman,
"l'm not happy."

250
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,159
So she says,
"Which fucking one are you, then?"

251
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,679
(Laughs)

252
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,999
Oh, fair enough.

253
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,479
Well, l'm off.
What you doing?

254
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,839
He was telling the truth.
He's the poster guy.

255
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,199
He wasn't with the football guys.
See this?

256
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,479
This is a key to the big poster frames.
And look.

257
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,639
- He was with a woman.
- So what?

258
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,279
He said he couldn't find his girlfriend.
That she had disappeared.

259
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,959
That's why he was in the toilets -
looking for her.

260
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,759
Listen, l've seen this
a hundred times before.

261
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,799
Couples on long drives,
they fight, they argue.

262
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,039
l bet you any money
she's waiting at home for him right now.

263
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,119
But what if she's not?

264
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,679
Are you gonna look through all the tapes
for her? lt'll take all night.

265
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,719
- Then that's how long it'll take me.
- Why? Who cares?

266
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,279
lt's not our problem.
Our job is to protect this place, that's it.

267
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,479
What?

268
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,599
(Laughs)

269
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,799
l'm off home.
See you tomorrow.

270
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,239
(Zakes breathes heavily)

271
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,999
Got you.

272
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,159
(Engine clunks)

273
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,919
Oh, no.

274
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,399
No, come on. Come on !

275
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,559
Come on !
Oh, no. Don't do this to me.

276
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,959
Please.

277
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,079
(Security guard) Where are you?
OK, now. Where are you?

278
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,239
- l thought you was going home.
- (Ronnie) Yeah, so did l .

279
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,999
But l couldn't have you being here
all on your own.

280
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,359
- Found anything yet?
- Yes and no.

281
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,319
Look.
There she is at the car.

282
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,799
Then she goes inside,
has a coffee,

283
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,639
the poster guy comes,
she leaves,

284
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,359
then, look, look, look.
See?

285
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,439
She made a phone call.

286
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,919
But then she just disappears.

287
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,159
- Let's try zone B.
- l'll do it. What's the timecode?

288
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:42,079
Timecode 00: 1 7:04.

289
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,079
- No, l can't see her.
- lt doesn't make no sense.

290
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,719
She came down the corridor,
and there's nowhere else for her to go.

291
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,439
Ronnie, man. Look, you typed in
the wrong timecode. Come on, man.

292
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,519
00: 1 7:04.

293
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,359
She goes through the emergency doors
with someone.

294
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,399
Why doesn't the alarm go off?

295
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,239
Aaargh !

296
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,479
Yeah, it's me.
We have a problem.

297
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,879
That girl we took, her boyfriend's made
trouble. l think he may be following you.

298
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,919
Got you, you bastard.

299
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,159
Where is he?

300
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,079
Oh, no.

301
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,159
There he is.

302
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,359
Oh, shit.

303
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,879
(Police radio) 'Ford Granada,
licence plate lima, echo, charlie...'

304
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,919
Oh, Jesus.

305
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,079
Yeah ! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Stop. Stop here!

306
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,239
Yes. Slow down,
slow down, slow down.

307
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,639
Yeah, l-l-l need you to help me.

308
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,239
l need you to help me. l need you
to get out the car, quick. Please.

309
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,839
Come on ! Come on.

310
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,719
My girlfriend's in the back
of one of these trucks.

311
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,919
- Just calm down.
- No, l am calm.

312
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,279
Just check out the back of
one of these trucks. My girlfriend's...

313
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,519
- Jesus Christ! What you doing?
- Gimme your hand.

314
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,119
- Have you got anything on you?
- l've got nothing on me!

315
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,359
You do not have to say anything.

316
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,199
Anything you do may be used
against you.

317
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,439
Yeah, yeah !

318
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,399
Right, listen to me.
Someone has taken my girlfriend.

319
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,119
You listen to me.
You calm the fuck down. OK?

320
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,519
- OK?
- OK.

321
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,959

Golf alpha 39,

No. No, no, no, no.

My girlfriend, Beth,
she's been taken by someone in a truck,
