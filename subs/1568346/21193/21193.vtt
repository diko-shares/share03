Yes, Madam.

Harry.

00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,664
Harry. It was here,
in the room.

24
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,601
It was terrible.

25
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,608
Now, Maria...
"Now, Maria," nothing.

26
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,367
I saw him, I tell you.

27
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,870
Standing just over here.

28
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,443

32
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,623
His eye?
Eye.

33
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,422
One eye
in the middle of his forehead.

34
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,324
And his face, Harry.

35
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,663
It was horrible.

36
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,933
Maria, I'm sure
you saw something.

37
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,203
Exactly what it was...
It was him.

38
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,400
After the show,
we'll try and find out.

39
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,702
Harry, I can't go on tonight.

40
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,871
Of course you can.
You're an artist.

41
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,216
You're not going to let
a little thing
like a ghost upset you.

42
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,808
So, you do believe me?
Of course, I believe you.

43
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,853
After the show,
I promise we'll find out
all about it.

44
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,416
Now you lie down
and have a little rest.

45
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,226
(man) You're so good for me.
Five minutes, please.

46
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,528
Put your feet up for a minute
or two. I'll come and see you
before you go on.

47
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,432
Oh, Harry.
I'll send Teresa.

48
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,462
Now, shut your eyes and rest.

49
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,371
Teresa.

50
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,179
Stay with her, won't you.

51
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,153
Is she all right?
Yes.

52
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,682
She saw something, Bill.

53
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,488
My music, Mr. Hunter.
Some of my music is missing.

54
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,691
You don't need it, Rossi.
You know it backwards.

55
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,631
I know, but who could have
done such a thing?

56
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,793
Someone's playing
a joke.

57
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,860
We've had too many jokes.
He's right.

58
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,933
Come on now.
This is a first night,
not a funeral.

He'll come in late,
you know that.

65

On the first night
of his own opera?

66
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,006
All the more reason for making
a good entrance.

I really don't understand it.

Don't you?
I understand it all right.

69
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,887
What I don't understand
is how Ambrose d'Arcy...

70
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,356
can write
so much excellent music
in the last few years...

71
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,949
when he has
so little musical taste.

72
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,426
Thank you, Mr. Hunter.

73
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,627
You're welcome.

So you keep telling me.

They seem to sense
good music, don't they?

76
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,393
Yes.

77
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,073
They like a good tune.

78
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,910
If he wasn't the best producer
in London...

79
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,709
I'm quite sure he meant
no disrespect, my lord.

he "investigating
that possibility"?

it would be the best thing.

No.

somewhere.

349
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,378
Good evening.
My name's Hunter.
I'm the producer of the opera.

350
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,107
Yeah, and
I'm the Queen of England.

351
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,170
[All laughing]

352
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,046
Now be off with you
and do your wooing elsewhere.

353
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,244
But I assure you...

354
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,084
Go on. Get out of here.

355
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:44,292
You haven't found a small
diamond brooch, have you?

356
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,887
When did you lose it?
Last night.

357
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,796
Last night?
Where was you sitting?

358
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,459
Stalls.
Front or back?

359
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,666
Front.
That's me.

360
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:56,395
Let me give you a hand, dear.
Keep your
thieving hands away.

361
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,463
It's all mine.

362
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,839
Do you think
it might still be
in the theater?

363
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:04,211
He's right. Come on, girls.

364
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,718
The front stall's mine.
Come back, you thieving lot.

365
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,617
(woman #1)
They're mine, I say.

366
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,423
[Women chattering]

367
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:56,566
Now, can you remember
which direction
this voice came from?

368
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,726
Well, not exactly.

369
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,405
Sit down exactly
just as you were sitting
when you heard it.

370
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,645
You were sitting there
and the voice came from...

371
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,917
The voice came
from somewhere over there.

372
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,687
The gas.

373
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,857
Harry.
Don't be afraid.

374
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,631
(The Phantom)
Mr. Hunter.

375
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,297
Mr. Hunter. I do not
want you meddling...

376
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,568
with something
that does not concern you.

377
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,340
Do you understand?

378
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,135
No, I do not.
Who are you?

379
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,207
Get away from here, get away.

380
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,050
You do not know
what may happen to you.

381
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,618
I'm not easily frightened.

382
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,386
Then you should be.

383
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,815
My threat is not an idle one.

384
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,288
There are forces of evil
at large in the opera tonight.

385
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,591
Leave the girl
and go while you may.

386
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,965
Do you hear me?

387
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,630
Leave the girl here and go.

388
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,439
[Women screaming]

389
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,078
It's him.
The Phantom.

390
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,207
We saw him.

391
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,174
[Sobbing]

392
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,350
Harry, look.

393
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,225
It's only the old ratcatcher.
Don't be alarmed.

394
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,769
I won't do you no harm.

395
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,698
Think I must have given
them cleaners a bit of a turn.

396
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:46,036
They're usually gone
by the time I'm around.

[Rats screeching]

398
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,277
I'm the ratcatcher,
you see, sir.

399
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,406
Place is alive with them.

400
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,141
I searches them out
with me lamp...

401
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,087
then I sort
of hypnotizes them...

402
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,819
till I'm near enough
to pounce.

403
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,389
I'm sorry, lady.

404
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,691
I caught a couple of beauties
tonight, sir. Fat.

405
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,264
Like young puppies, they are.
Here, I'll show you.

406
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,298
Now, none of that.

407
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,570
I'll find them
for you in a moment, sir.

408
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,435
You'll never believe
your eyes.
Please stop him.

409
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,667
Please don't bother
on our account.
No?

410
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,540
I could let you have them both
for tuppence, sir.

411
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,739
They'd make a lovely pie,
you know.

412
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,283
We're vegetarians.
Pity.

413
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,551
Here's something
for your trouble, though.
Thank you, sir.

414
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:34,687
Thank you very much, sir.
Well, good night to you then.

415
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,902
Wait here.

416
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,688
(The Phantom)
Young woman.

417
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:42,317
Young woman,
you must come with me.

[Christine screaming]

419
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,088
It's all right.

420
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,086
I did see him, Harry.

421
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,916
He was standing there
at the top of the stairs.

422
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,790
And he had one eye and a mask?

423
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,429
Yes, all black.

424
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,091
And he stood there staring
and staring at me.

425
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:01,802
It felt as if he was trying
to burn a hole in my brain.

426
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,862
[Door opening]

427
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:07,466
The kettle's on and tea
won't be a minute.
How are you feeling, my dear?

428
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,376
She needs to sleep.
Quite.

429
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,711
A nice cup of tea,
then off to bed with you.

430
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,915
You do believe me, Harry.

431

get rid of her.

That's all,
thank you very much.

What' s going on, Ambrose?

464
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,587
I have been endeavoring
to find someone...

465
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:43,395
with the ability to do justice
to the leading role
in my opera, Mr. Hunter.

466
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,935
I thought you'd agreed that
Miss Charles was to sing it.

467
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,698
You may have thought so.

468
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,232
Now, if you'll excuse me.
No.

469
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,276
Have I not made
myself sufficiently clear?

470
00:36:56,214 --> 00:37:00,378
Miss Charles is not to sing
in my opera. Not in the
leading part nor in any other.

471
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,382
She has received
her dismissal this morning.

472
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,618
You small-minded, fatheaded...
Be careful, Mr. Hunter.

473
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,091
Because she refuses
to go to your apartment...

474
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,386
in the middle of the night...
You're dismissed.
You understand?

475
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,930
Now get out of my way.

476
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,970
Sorry, Harry. He made me
send the note round by hand.

477
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,104
I'll go and see her.

478
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,477
If anything else happens,
let me know, will you?

479
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,637
Yes.

480
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,617
No, he can't.

481
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:40,083
It's not fair.
Of course it's not.

482
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,088
If he's stopped me
from playing St. Joan...

483
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,155
Not to let me sing at all,
it just isn't fair.

484
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,864
Fairness isn't one
of his virtues, Christine.

485
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,558
I forgot to ask...

486
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm sorry.

487
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,569
It's all right, Mrs. Tucker.

488
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,672
I thought you'd like a glass
of sherry wine,
but perhaps...

489
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,735
Nothing I'd
like better, Mrs. Tucker.

490
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,669
I'll drink it...

491
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,774
while Miss Charles is
getting ready to come
and have lunch with me.

492
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,319
No, Harry. I couldn't.
Of course you could.

493
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,984
I insist that you come
and celebrate.
Celebrate, Mr. Hunter?

494
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,958
Yes, Mrs. Tucker.
Today, we both got the sack.

495
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,587
Oh, no, Harry.
Oh, yes, Harry.

496
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:23,596
So we've both got nothing
to do and all the time
in the world to do it in.

497
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,431
And I'll allow you just...

498
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,604
ten minutes of it
to get ready.
Not a moment more.

499
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,766
I'll try.

00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,320
I wonder if you could tell me
where you got this.

503
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,791
Got it? I made it.
You...

504
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,060
Where did you
get this music from?

505
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,325
That's some
of the Professor's.

506
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,898
Professor Petrie. He used to
teach singing at the Academy.

507
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,295
When he remembered
to go there, that is.

508
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,839
He was a little bit...
But very nice.

509
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,307
He used to play the piano
all day long.

510
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,510
I have mostly musicians
stay with me, you know.

511
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,816
He used to play night and day.
I just loved listening to him.

512
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,820
Then the neighbors
started banging on the walls,
so I had to put a stop to it.

513
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:27,380
Do you think it'd be possible
for me to have a closer look
at that music?

514
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,153
Well...
If it's not too much trouble.

515
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:31,660
No, he left a whole pile
of it here.

516
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,863
He left me enough
to paper the house.

517
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,893
But I threw some of it out.

518
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,668
Here's some,
but it's a bit faded now.

519
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,361
dd[piano playing]

520
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,378
I remember that bit.

521
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,219
What became of this Professor,
Mrs. Tucker?

522
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:34,849
He was killed.
Burned to death in a fire.

523
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,751
It was terrible.

524
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,795
A fire?
At a printer's.

525
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,329
He'd gone to see them about
printing his music.

526
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,799
The whole place caught fire
while he was there.

527
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,027
Do you know the name
of this printer's,
Mrs. Tucker?

528
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,073
Let me see. Yes.

529
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,608
It was Piggot's.
By London Bridge.

530
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,237
Ready.

531
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,006
In five minutes exactly.
Good girl.

532
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,781
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Tucker,
for all your help.

533
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,319
What about your sherry...
Of course.

534
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,055
Goodbye, Mrs. Tucker.

535
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,091
The fire, sir.
That would be a bit
before my time.

536
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:20,229
Perhaps you would care
to see our Mr. Weaver, sir?
He's the master printer.

537
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,296
He's been here
a very long time.
Yes, I'd like that very much.

538
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,069
I'll see
if he's available, sir.

539
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,375
[Machines rattling]

540
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:30,011
What is this, Harry?

541
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,579
It's a long story.
I'll tell you over lunch.

542
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:38,446
Mr. Weaver?
You were enquiring
about the fire, sir?

543
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:41,958
Yes, well, rather
about someone
who died in the fire.

544
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,817
No one died.

545
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,488
But I understood that someone
was burned to death
in the fire.

546
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,767
Someone was badly burned, sir.
But he didn't die.

547
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,527
Not here, anyway.

548
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,500
What happened?

549
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,674
He broke in one night, sir.

550
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,409
He must have knocked over
a lamp or something...

551
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,408
and put
the whole place ablaze.

552
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,345
He tried to put it out with...

553
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,884
what he thought
was water, sir.

554
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,586
But it was some of this.

555
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,520
For etching the plates.

556
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,121
He threw a whole jarful
at the flames.

557
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,385
Some of it splashed back
in his face.

558
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,502
Nitric acid, sir.

559
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,402
What became of him?

560
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:35,642
He ran out screaming.
No one ever saw
any more of him.

561
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,539
And you've no idea
who he was?
No, sir.

562
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,819
Nor why he broke in?
He was a burglar.

563
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,750
I suppose, sir.

564
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,758
Thank you very much
for seeing us, Sergeant.

565
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,659
I'm sure
you must be very busy.
It is quite all right, sir.

566
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,959
I'm enquiring about a fire.
A fire, sir?

567
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,428
At Piggot's, the printers.
Do you remember it?

568
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,192
I remember it well, sir.
I was on duty. Saw it all.

569
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,469
There was a man badly burned.
There was indeed, sir.

570
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:06,536
He came running out
of that place
screaming blue murder...

571
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,271
if you'll
pardon the expression, Miss.

572
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,337
Where did he run to?
Straight up the street
and into the river.

573
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,007
The river?
That's right, Miss.

574
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,812
Straight in, he went.

575
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,077
About here.

576
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,392
[Children chattering]

577
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,796
So that's where he went.

578
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:32,094
Who, Harry?
Who is this mystery man?
I'll tell you over lunch.

579
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,371
Lunch? It's almost three.

580
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,464
Is it? Well, tea then.

581
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,565
[Both laughing]

582
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,906
We'll have tea in the park,
then a row on the lake...

583
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,616
and dinner at Frascati's.

584
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,048
And then perhaps
we'll have some supper.

585
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:08,827
[Inhaling]

586
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,775
The cab's stopped.

587
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,401
Has it?

588
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,607
Well, tell him to go round
the park again.

589
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:25,815
Harry, we can't.
He's been round
four times already.

590
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,157
Well, perhaps he likes it.

591
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,614
[Giggling]

592
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,871
Cabbie, would you mind
taking us round
the park again?

593
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:46,341
Well, sir, being
a pleasant enough evening
for myself...

594
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,809
I wouldn't mind a bit.

595
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:51,279
I don't suppose
old Lightning here
would grumble much either.

596
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,578
But, me missus...

597
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,613
Me missus
has a nervous disposition.

598
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,087
She don't like being left
on her own at nighttime.
She don't.

599
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,318
So, if you wouldn't mind, sir.

600
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,189
I understand perfectly.
Thought you would, sir.

601
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,500
Looks like I'll have
to take you home.

602
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,959
Thank you for a lovely day.

603
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,764
The first of many,
I wouldn't wonder, Miss, eh?

604
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:16,828
[Laughing]

605
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,905
I think I'll just go
and inspect the harness, sir.

606

[Horse grunting]

607
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,256

All in order, sir.

608
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,990
All in order, sir,
with the harness.

609
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:43,927
Yes, I'll just
climb aboard again.

610
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,577
Harry, you never did tell me
about that mystery man,
you know.

611
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,143
It's quite simple.

612
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:04,681
I found out how Ambrose d'Arcy
managed to write
such good music.

613
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:08,190
He didn't.
Someone else wrote it for him.

614
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,785
Are you sure?
Near enough.

615
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,431
What are you going to do?
Nothing.

616
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,257
The real composer's dead.

617
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,799
We've enough trouble
without making more.

618
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,975
All right then, sir?
Very all right, thank you.

619
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,277
All right. We're away then.

620
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,417

We'll soon be home now.

the world will be filled
with your admirers.

from you, I shall ask for it.

for it now because

What am I going to do?

Mr. Hunter to come back.

What? What did you say?

00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:42,214
I think you should apologize
to Mr. Hunter
and ask him to come back.

672
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,616
How dare you?

673
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,411
I dare because as manager
of this opera house...

674
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:48,957
I am responsible
to my director
for its welfare.

675
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:52,984
And if I allow you to carry on
in this manner,
we shall all be made bankrupt.

I refuse to stay and listen
to this treason.
Very well.

upon myself to ask
Mr. Hunter to return.

Mr. Hunter, what have I done?

685
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,297
You've proved that
you're a man and not a mouse.

686

You've also persuaded me
to come back and help you
clear up this mess.

Will you? Will you really?

688
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:39,502
I'll just join you in one of
these to celebrate, then we'll
get down to work, shall we?

689
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,371
(Harry)
Thank you, gentlemen,
thank you.

690
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,406
Would you two change places?

691
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:46,804
That's good.

692
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:50,448
Would you come forward
a few paces, please?
Thank you.

693
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,853
I am sorry, ladies
and gentlemen, I shall have
to leave for a few minutes.

694
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:00,418
I hope I won't be very long.

695
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,692
Carry on, Bill.
Harry.

696
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:10,298
(Bill)
Right, we'll go
from the opening scene.

697
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:13,274
Her bed hasn't been slept in,
but she must
have gone up there...

698
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,436
because her coat was hanging
in the wardrobe...

699
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,709
and the window was wide open,
and I never leave
the window wide open...

700
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,344
because you know why.

701
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:23,651
She can't have left
very early, can she,
without your knowing?

702
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,711
I'm up at 5:30 every morning.

703
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:29,020
I don't sleep very well
at the best of times.
Wind, you know.

704
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,117
I'm terribly troubled
with the wind.

705
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:35,155
Just as soon as she does
return, perhaps you could ask
her to come to the theater.

706
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,994
I shall tell her at once,
Mr. Hunter.

707
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,399
I just can't think
what could have
happened to her.

Do you think you can become
a great singer
without suffering?

I have not suffered?

720

work there. 10 years

00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:44,777
What makes you sure?

736
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,379
Current's very fast here.
He'd never have
stood a chance.

That's why we're sure.

Well, did you?

I've just said the river runs
very fast, sir. What would
have been the good?

00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:00,399
Now, I've got work to do, sir,
even if you haven't.

741
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,665
All right, Sergeant.
Well, thank you anyway.

Here, Professor Petrie.
You'd better take him.

761
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:53,786
Did he harm you?
No.

762
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:02,263
How do you know my name?

763
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,266
I know who you are, Professor,
because I made it my business
to find out.

764
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,142
I also know something else
about you.

765
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,806
The opera we've been
rehearsing was composed
by you, wasn't it?

766
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,718
Yes, that is true.

767
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:32,652
You took it to Ambrose d'Arcy
for help in getting it
published, didn't you?

768
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,533
What happened?
What happened?

769
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:46,066
I took him all of my music.

(Ambrose)
?50, no more.

771
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:54,981
But there is 10 years'
work there. Ten years
of my life, sir.

772
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,645
Surely ?50 is...

773
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,277
Am I not correct
in thinking that...

774
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:01,721
you have never
had any of your work
published, Professor...

775
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:04,148
Petrie?

776
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,661
Not, not yet, but...
So you are completely unknown.

777
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:10,629
Of course, but everybody...

778
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,429
There are
many unknown composers...

779
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:15,095
who'd be only too glad
to have
their works published...

01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,467
No.

783
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:26,207
There's a full symphony here,
sir, and two quartets...

784
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,977
and a concerto for viola.

785
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:32,752

a new opera, complete.

01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,519
I'm sorry.

01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:44,621

and the papers
will be ready to sign.

to have to ask this...

but perhaps
you could manage...
What?

this intrusion,
but I must see you.

I should find you here.

my music, don't you?

I don't understand.

01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:42,473

from you, remember?
Yes, to publish, yes.

808
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,542
But they're printing your name
on the cover.

809
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,420
My name on my music.
Is that so surprising?

810
