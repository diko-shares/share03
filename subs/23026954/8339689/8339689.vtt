00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.615
Well, technically,
we never agreed.

1079
00:44:50.702 --> 00:44:52.920
- We're here to help.
- I said this was a bad idea.

1080
00:44:53.007 --> 00:44:54.615
Yes, it's too dangerous.

1081
00:44:54.702 --> 00:44:56.920
That's why we're in disguise.

1082
00:44:57.007 --> 00:45:00.180
Sunglasses are not a disguise.

1083
00:45:00.267 --> 00:45:04.224
Claws, I couldn't let
you do this alone.

1084
00:45:06.051 --> 00:45:08.137
[sighs] All right.

1085
00:45:08.224 --> 00:45:11.311
Well, uh, keep your hoods
up for your own sake.

1086
00:45:11.398 --> 00:45:16.311
And just try to
act unnatural, OK?

1087
00:45:16.398 --> 00:45:18.441
- OK.
- Yeah.

1088
00:45:18.528 --> 00:45:21.746
[indistinct chatter]

1089
00:45:21.833 --> 00:45:23.877
OK, are you getting this?

1090
00:45:23.964 --> 00:45:25.137
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

1091
00:45:25.224 --> 00:45:27.093

<i>Green is the color of tomorrow.</i>

<i>[moaning]</i>

1094
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:33.615
What's that sound?

1095
00:45:33.702 --> 00:45:35.051
It's Heath eating.

1096
00:45:35.137 --> 00:45:36.485
Dog meat is fire.

1097
00:45:36.572 --> 00:45:38.311
Oh. No, it's not dog.

1098
00:45:38.398 --> 00:45:40.398
The name, hot dog was
coined in the 1860s

1099
00:45:40.485 --> 00:45:42.180
when German immigrants
began settling

1100
00:45:42.267 --> 00:45:44.311
long thin sausages which they
nicknamed dachshund sausages,

1101
00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:46.137
like the dog breed.

1102
00:45:46.224 --> 00:45:48.441
Dachshund is fire.

1103
00:45:48.528 --> 00:45:49.746
OK. Enjoy.

1104
00:45:49.833 --> 00:45:51.354
Mm-hmm.

1105
00:45:51.441 --> 00:45:53.615
It looks fancy in there.

1106
00:45:53.702 --> 00:45:54.920
<i>Coleman Eves...</i>

1107
00:45:55.007 --> 00:45:56.485
It is fancy.

00:45:56.572 --> 00:46:00.180
<i>Fueled by timeless

1109
00:46:00.267 --> 00:46:01.920
<i>Wait. Guys.</i>

1110
00:46:02.007 --> 00:46:03.833
What's happening?

1111
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.920
[Bastet chittering]

1112
00:46:07.007 --> 00:46:11.615
Guys, I think Bastet
senses magic somewhere.

1113
00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:14.528
No. Actually, everywhere.

1114
00:46:14.615 --> 00:46:18.050
Wait. Coleman Eves?

1115
00:46:18.137 --> 00:46:19.528
It's an anagram.

1116
00:46:19.615 --> 00:46:21.964
It's an anagram?
What's an anagram?

1117
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:23.877
It's a word or phrase
that uses the same letters

1118
00:46:23.877 --> 00:46:28.137
to spell different things,
like a secret message.

1119
00:46:28.224 --> 00:46:30.746
Salem Coven. Wait.
The company's a coven?

1120
00:46:30.833 --> 00:46:33.398
The mother of all covens
from the Salem Witch Trials.

1121
00:46:33.485 --> 00:46:36.050
The Salem Witch Trials?

1122
00:46:36.137 --> 00:46:37.964
In 1692 colonial Massachusetts,

1123
00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:40.441
200 people were accused
of practicing witchcraft.

1124
00:46:40.528 --> 00:46:42.441
19 witches were executed.

1125
00:46:42.528 --> 00:46:44.572
So humans treat witches as
bad as they treat monsters?

1126
00:46:44.572 --> 00:46:46.224
Yeah, and witches
treat monsters worse.

1127
00:46:46.311 --> 00:46:47.920
Clawdeen, get out of there now.

1128
00:46:48.006 --> 00:46:49.615
<i>Draculaura is here alone.</i>

1129
00:46:49.702 --> 00:46:51.262
Well, we need a better
plan than walking

1131

<i>Claws.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.398
<i>- Clawdeen, what's happening?
- To live is to grow.</i>

1133
00:46:58.485 --> 00:47:01.877
I know someone who can help.

1134
00:47:01.964 --> 00:47:05.311
[elevator dings]

1135
00:47:05.398 --> 00:47:06.877
Come on.

1136
00:47:09.093 --> 00:47:12.354
Hi, Mom.
- Ellis. Hi.

1137
00:47:12.441 --> 00:47:16.398
Darling, you're back. [laughs]

1138
00:47:16.485 --> 00:47:19.702
And, oh, my.

1139
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:21.615
- Oh, um...
- Oh.

1140
00:47:21.702 --> 00:47:24.398
Not a hugger? Forgive me.

1141
00:47:24.485 --> 00:47:27.311
Draculaura, daughter of Dracula,

1142
00:47:27.398 --> 00:47:29.485
princess of vampires,

1143
00:47:29.572 --> 00:47:33.050
and budding practitioner
of our own magical arts.

1144
00:47:33.137 --> 00:47:34.441
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1145
00:47:34.528 --> 00:47:35.963
You too, your majesty.

1146
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:37.963
Oh, that's very proper.

1147
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:39.920
We don't really go for
titles around here.

1148
00:47:40.006 --> 00:47:41.833
It would freak out
the stockholders.

1149
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.702
So just call me Z.

1150
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:47.702
Um, OK. Z.

1151
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.572
Ellis tells me we have a
common interest... peace.

1152
00:47:50.659 --> 00:47:52.224
Yes.

1153
00:47:52.311 --> 00:47:54.963
Monsters and witches
aren't so different.

1154
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:58.877
We've always been persecuted by
those who don't understand us.

1155
00:47:58.963 --> 00:48:00.528
- Are these potions?
- No.

1156
00:48:00.615 --> 00:48:02.180
Those are herbs.

1157
00:48:02.267 --> 00:48:03.790
Magic herbs.

1158
00:48:03.877 --> 00:48:05.398
Just regular herbs.

1159
00:48:05.485 --> 00:48:07.528
We learned a few things.

1160
00:48:07.615 --> 00:48:09.963
People are terrified
of illness and death,

1161
00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:13.877
so we used our craft to design
longevity products for them.

1162
00:48:13.963 --> 00:48:16.050
So you're profiting
off of the fears

1163
00:48:16.137 --> 00:48:17.615
of the very people
that used to fear you?

1164
00:48:17.615 --> 00:48:19.702
Yes. Exactly.

1165
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:22.267
Here. Try this.

1166
00:48:22.354 --> 00:48:24.006
It's turmeric, jasmine,

1167
00:48:24.093 --> 00:48:26.702
and dandelion-infused
rejuvenation elixir.

1168
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:28.790
Your secret botanicals?

1169
00:48:28.877 --> 00:48:31.790
Well, it wouldn't be a secret
if I just told, you would it?

1170
00:48:31.877 --> 00:48:33.267
Cheers.

1171
00:48:35.528 --> 00:48:37.528
[laughs] I know.

1172
00:48:37.615 --> 00:48:39.093
It's terrible.

1173
00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.746
I've always suspected
it's the dandelion.

1174
00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:45.485
But it is guaranteed to
add years to your life,

1175
00:48:45.572 --> 00:48:47.919
not that you need it.

1176
00:48:48.006 --> 00:48:50.790
This is the type of know-how
that we can share with you.

1177
00:48:50.876 --> 00:48:52.528
We can help each
other if we could just

1178
00:48:52.615 --> 00:48:56.137
get past our conflict.

1179
00:48:56.224 --> 00:48:58.311
I'm not what you expected, am I?

1180
00:48:58.398 --> 00:49:01.093
No. You're definitely not.

1181
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:05.093
Draculaura, I see so
much potential in you

1182
00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:08.572
to be a leader, to
change the world.

1183
00:49:08.659 --> 00:49:13.354
I think it is time that
you learn your true power.

1184
00:49:13.441 --> 00:49:16.267
Tomorrow, witches from
all over the world

1185
00:49:16.354 --> 00:49:18.659
are coming here for a conclave.

1186
00:49:18.746 --> 00:49:20.528
It has always been my dream...

1187
00:49:20.615 --> 00:49:23.398
I can speak to
them, explain that

1188
00:49:23.485 --> 00:49:25.441
not all vampires want war, that
there are reasonable voices

1189
00:49:25.441 --> 00:49:28.006
on our side too.

1190
00:49:28.093 --> 00:49:31.180
That could make
all the difference.

1191
00:49:31.267 --> 00:49:34.485
You are even more
impressive than I expected.

1192
00:49:34.572 --> 00:49:36.137
Thank you.

1193
00:49:36.224 --> 00:49:38.137
We have a beautiful guest
room set up for you.

1194
00:49:38.224 --> 00:49:39.876
Melissandra will show you.

1195
00:49:39.963 --> 00:49:41.180
So rest up.

1196
00:49:41.267 --> 00:49:42.746
We have a big day tomorrow.

1197
00:49:42.832 --> 00:49:45.006
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1198
00:49:45.093 --> 00:49:47.572
Right this way.

1199
00:49:47.659 --> 00:49:49.441
See you later.

1200

[car beeping]

1201
00:49:57.267 --> 00:50:00.528
For the record, I think
this is a terrible idea.

1202
00:50:00.615 --> 00:50:02.746
Good to see you too, Dad.

1203
00:50:05.093 --> 00:50:06.398
Thanks for coming.

1204
00:50:06.485 --> 00:50:08.615
Always, little cub.

1205
00:50:08.702 --> 00:50:09.789
Hey, gang.
- Hey, Mr. Wolf.

1206
00:50:09.876 --> 00:50:11.485
- Hey, Mr. Wolf.
- What's up?

1207
00:50:11.572 --> 00:50:13.012
Let's see if we can
find your friend.

1208
00:50:15.354 --> 00:50:16.659
Anybody hungry?

1209
00:50:16.746 --> 00:50:18.311
Dude, you just had,
like, nine hot dogs.

1210
00:50:18.398 --> 00:50:20.267
Dachshunds are small,
right, Frankie?

1211
00:50:20.354 --> 00:50:21.963
B-R-B.

1212
00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.180
No, you're going
to get us caught.

1213
00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.311
Heath.

1214
00:50:24.398 --> 00:50:26.702
[whispers harshly]
Heath. Heath.

1215
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:29.267
It feels like ages since I've
hung out in your work van.

1216
00:50:29.354 --> 00:50:30.746
It has been.

1217
00:50:30.832 --> 00:50:32.832
And the rules haven't changed.

1218
00:50:32.919 --> 00:50:36.006
Both: No eating

1220
00:50:37.963 --> 00:50:41.963
OK, Coleman Eves is one
of our bigger clients.

1221
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:44.572
A little mysterious,
but they pay well.

1222
00:50:44.659 --> 00:50:46.528
It's a crazy good
security system.

1223
00:50:46.615 --> 00:50:48.528
- Can you get us past it?
- I hope so.

1224
00:50:48.615 --> 00:50:51.615
I helped build it.

1225
00:50:51.702 --> 00:50:53.963
Since Draculaura has no pulse,

1226
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:56.050
it should be easy to spot her

1227
00:50:56.137 --> 00:50:58.876
using biometric
security filters.

1228
00:50:58.963 --> 00:51:00.832
All these years,
I've never actually

1229
00:51:00.919 --> 00:51:03.137
hunted someone using my tech.

1230
00:51:03.224 --> 00:51:05.354
It's like we're on
a secret mission,

1231
00:51:05.441 --> 00:51:09.093
and I'm the guy, the tech guy.

1232
00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.659
I've always wanted
to be the guy.

1233
00:51:10.745 --> 00:51:12.745
I know. Dad, can we...

1234
00:51:12.832 --> 00:51:15.832
Oh. Right. Sorry. OK.

1235
00:51:15.919 --> 00:51:18.702
Wait. Look at this.

1236
00:51:18.789 --> 00:51:20.963
Bingo.
- Yes.

1237
00:51:22.528 --> 00:51:24.485
OK, let's see where she went.

1239
00:51:29.963 --> 00:51:32.267
- Cleo, hey. What's up?
<i>- Things are a disaster.</i>

1240
00:51:32.354 --> 00:51:33.963
<i>Dinner's over.</i>

1241
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:36.659
Abby and I had to hand out
the cookies, which completely

1242
00:51:36.745 --> 00:51:38.180
backfired because it
made you look like

1243
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.701
an out-of-touch
elitist. Meanwhile...

1244
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:43.701
Hey, how do witches
bake their cookies?

1245
00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:46.050
In a coven. [laughter]

1246
00:51:46.137 --> 00:51:47.577
We are literally
feeding her material

1247
00:51:47.659 --> 00:51:49.354
to use against us.

1248
00:51:49.441 --> 00:51:50.832
I'm sorry.

1249
00:51:50.919 --> 00:51:52.528
I just need you to cover
for me a little longer.

1250
00:51:52.528 --> 00:51:54.267
How? I need you here.

1251
00:51:54.354 --> 00:51:57.963
Oh, also, not-real
