00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:34.662
Hey, ghouls.

2
00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:36.879
Check this out.

3
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.705
<i>Can we talk about my
favorite werewolf?</i>

4
00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:41.792
<i>Clawdeen Wolf.</i>

5
00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.009
<i>She is funny and fierce
and has a big heart.</i>

6
00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:48.227
<i>She always stands
up for her friends.</i>

7
00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:51.270
<i>Clawdeen came to Monster
High with a big secret.</i>

8
00:00:51.357 --> 00:00:54.966
<i>She was hiding the truth that
she was half wolf, half human.</i>

9
00:00:55.053 --> 00:00:58.401
<i>To go to a monster school
that hated humans...</i>

10
00:00:58.488 --> 00:01:01.879
<i>but when Monster High
faced its biggest threat...</i>

11
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.270
Smile.

12
00:01:03.357 --> 00:01:04.531
What have you done?

13
00:01:04.618 --> 00:01:06.227
Think of it as extra credit.

14
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.444
<i>From now on, true monster heart</i>

15
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:16.314
will mean exactly that, who
you truly are on the inside.

16
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.835
You changed the world, baby cub.

17
00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:22.835
<i>By owning her humanness,
being her amazing true self,</i>

18
00:01:22.922 --> 00:01:25.488
<i>she transformed Monster High</i>

19
00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:27.792
<i>into what it is today,
a place that accepts</i>

20
00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.270
<i>all monsters of all kinds.</i>

21
00:01:32.662 --> 00:01:34.183
Oh, my Ra.

22
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.488
I seriously can't
believe some random ghoul

23
00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:38.575
in Scary Indiana made this.

24
00:01:38.662 --> 00:01:39.618
A million likes?

25
00:01:39.704 --> 00:01:41.009
Clawdeen's famous.

26
00:01:41.096 --> 00:01:44.488
999,000, OK? Let's
not get crazy.

27
00:01:46.922 --> 00:01:47.879
Hey.

28
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.835
Who are all these new kids?

29
00:01:49.922 --> 00:01:51.575
Freshmen, like us last year,

30
00:01:51.662 --> 00:01:54.401
only not as fabulous.

31
00:01:54.488 --> 00:01:55.444
Smile.

32
00:01:57.444 --> 00:01:58.662
Hey.

33
00:01:58.748 --> 00:02:00.531
Oh. Here you go.

34
00:02:00.618 --> 00:02:02.053
Enjoy.
- Hey, Draculaura.

35
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.488
Great party.

36
00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:05.375
Got to say goodbye to
summer in style, ghouls.

37
00:02:05.444 --> 00:02:06.879
- Yeah!
- Thanks.

38
00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:08.792
- Hi.
- Lagoona.

39
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.488
Where have you been?

40
00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:12.695
I was playing sea pong with
the serpents in your moat.

41
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:18.835
I might have eaten one or two.

42
00:02:18.922 --> 00:02:20.162
Before rants and lectures bore,

43
00:02:20.227 --> 00:02:22.748
protect my father's
hardwood floor.

44
00:02:25.053 --> 00:02:26.748
- Thanks, D.
- Of course.

45
00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:28.661
Enjoy.
- Uh-huh.

46
00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:29.704
Uh-huh. Yeah.

47
00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:33.140
I'm en fuego.

48
00:02:33.227 --> 00:02:35.357
Well, not literally.
I'm pacing myself.

49
00:02:35.444 --> 00:02:36.966
Will there be dancing later?

50
00:02:37.053 --> 00:02:39.704
There usually is, right, D?

51
00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.704
It's always a crowd pleaser.

52
00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:43.835
Speaking of crowd pleasers,

53
00:02:43.922 --> 00:02:45.444
any sign of the world's
newest Eek Tok star?

54
00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:47.183
Not yet.

55
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.009
But she better get here soon if
she knows what's good for her.

56
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:50.401
Ow.

57
00:02:50.488 --> 00:02:51.575
Moe, again?

58
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:53.183
Bad hair day?

59
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.531
Yeah, they've just
been on edge lately.

60
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:55.966
Because they're bored.

61
00:02:56.053 --> 00:02:57.748
You never let them out, bro.

62
00:02:57.835 --> 00:03:00.140
Let your light shine.

63
00:03:00.227 --> 00:03:01.575
Heath, no flames!

64
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.531
I said no flames!

65
00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:04.879
Yes, sir.

66
00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:06.357
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

67
00:03:06.444 --> 00:03:09.227
Your birthday will
be nothing like this.

68
00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:11.617
Only the most important
monsters will be there.

69
00:03:11.704 --> 00:03:14.357
Dad, I told you, I just
want something small

70
00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.531
with my friends.

71
00:03:15.617 --> 00:03:17.009
I heard you.

72
00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.314
And one day, when you're older,

73
00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:20.053
you can pay for your own parties

74
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.096
and then you can throw
them any way you like.

75
00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:24.879
Right.

76
00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:26.314
Oh. I have to take this.

77
00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:28.314
It's my brother.

78
00:03:28.401 --> 00:03:31.096
I finally got a mobile.

79
00:03:31.183 --> 00:03:33.314
Hello, Dadu. How are you?

80
00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:36.575
They're here.

81
00:03:38.748 --> 00:03:40.661
You're late.

82
00:03:40.748 --> 00:03:42.574
Nice to see you too.

83
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:44.183
I just had to pick up a friend.

84
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.053
Hi. It's me. I'm the friend.

85
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.574
The Boos are back.

86
00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:55.617
This is going to be...

87
00:03:55.704 --> 00:03:57.922
all: The best year ever!

88
00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:59.488
Come on. Come on.

89
00:04:02.661 --> 00:04:03.922
This is amazing.

90
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:05.531
- Why, thank you.
- Clawdeen.

91
00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:06.704
Look. It's really her.

92
00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:08.444
Hi, Clawdeen.

93
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:10.617
Uh, do I know them?

94
00:04:10.704 --> 00:04:12.444
No, you silly wolf.

95
00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:14.009
It's that Eek Tok video.

96
00:04:14.096 --> 00:04:16.227
Everyone's seen it.

97
00:04:16.314 --> 00:04:17.357
Oh.

98
00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:18.661
Wow.

99
00:04:18.748 --> 00:04:21.096
Hey.

100
00:04:21.183 --> 00:04:24.704
- Hi.
- The alpha wolf arrives.

101
00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:26.357
How's it feel to be famous?

102
00:04:26.444 --> 00:04:28.183
Yeah, I...

103
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.574
I think I might have
liked it better when

104
00:04:29.574 --> 00:04:30.792
I was just one of the pack.

105
00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.314
Well, you better get used to it.

106
00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:34.227
You're the big monster
on campus this year.

107
00:04:34.314 --> 00:04:35.270
Come on.

108
00:04:35.357 --> 00:04:36.748
The new kids all
want to meet you.

109
00:04:36.835 --> 00:04:38.792
- Right.
- Go say hi.

110
00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.183
- Hey, Clawdeen.
- It's her.

111
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.792

dubbed in Turkish by
a kid in Istanghoul.

184
00:07:57.748 --> 00:07:59.748
- What?
- No way.

185
00:07:59.835 --> 00:08:01.140
Look at that.

186
00:08:01.227 --> 00:08:02.879
Wow. Our little
wolf's gone viral.

187
00:08:05.053 --> 00:08:07.227
Look at the likes.

188
00:08:07.313 --> 00:08:09.183
Oh, my ghoul. Oh,
and the comments.

189
00:08:12.227 --> 00:08:14.183
It's time.

190
00:08:21.617 --> 00:08:25.140
Hello, all my new
ghouls and banshees,

191
00:08:25.227 --> 00:08:26.922
kookafurras... oh!

192
00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:29.400
And poltergeists.

193
00:08:29.487 --> 00:08:31.704
Monster High welcomes you.

194
00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:33.192
So my hair guy was
like, hairspray?

195
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.748
And I'm like, no, never use it.

196
00:08:34.835 --> 00:08:36.574
And he goes, it'll look great.

197
00:08:36.661 --> 00:08:38.661
And I was like, OK.

198
00:08:38.748 --> 00:08:40.313
Bad idea.

199
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.400
Whoosh.

200
00:08:41.487 --> 00:08:42.879
Even the scissors melted.

201
00:08:42.966 --> 00:08:44.792
Now I'm, like, totally
banned from the salon.

202
00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:46.530
I've been banned from
salon since birth.

203
00:08:46.617 --> 00:08:47.879
My hair doesn't grow
on account of it

204
00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:49.530
being from a dead person.

205
00:08:49.617 --> 00:08:51.966
And I have Undead
Civilizations after lunch.

206
00:08:52.053 --> 00:08:53.313
- So do I.
- Oh.

207
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.269
I'll save you a seat.
- Gracias, thanks.

208
00:08:55.356 --> 00:08:57.487
Oh.

209
00:08:57.574 --> 00:08:59.530
What is it?

210
00:08:59.617 --> 00:09:02.183
Calm down.

211
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:04.617
What?

212
00:09:04.704 --> 00:09:07.009
Tora's back?

213
00:09:09.617 --> 00:09:11.487
Oh, my Ra.

214
00:09:11.574 --> 00:09:12.966
She's back.

215
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:14.140
- What?
- Who's back?

216
00:09:14.227 --> 00:09:16.183
You know, her.

217
00:09:24.966 --> 00:09:28.356
Monster High, I missed you.

218
00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.922
Wow. That's, like, a you move.

219
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:32.574
Who is she?

220
00:09:32.661 --> 00:09:34.356
Toralei Stripe.

221
00:09:34.443 --> 00:09:36.792
She studied abroad last
year in Scaris, France.

222
00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:38.530
Growls, ghouls.

223
00:09:38.617 --> 00:09:40.053
- What's up, Toralei?
- Hey, Tor.

224
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.096
It's been a minute.

225
00:09:41.183 --> 00:09:42.704
Hello, Toralei.

226
00:09:42.792 --> 00:09:44.661
Cleo, you look ferocious.

227
00:09:44.748 --> 00:09:46.269
And how was your year abroad?

228
00:09:46.356 --> 00:09:48.661
Did you catch any
cute Scaresian mice?

229
00:09:48.748 --> 00:09:50.966
Oh, I caught creatures
much bigger than mice.

230
00:09:52.966 --> 00:09:55.183
- Oh.
- She said she ate them all.

231
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:57.356
Fierce.

232
00:09:57.443 --> 00:09:59.487
Hi. I'm Frankie.

233
00:09:59.574 --> 00:10:01.966
And can I just say, you
are totally clawesome

234
00:10:02.053 --> 00:10:05.009
and intimidating, yet
still approachable way.

235
00:10:05.096 --> 00:10:06.748
Frankie, do you always

236
00:10:06.835 --> 00:10:08.053
just speak every thought
that comes to mind?

237
00:10:08.053 --> 00:10:09.748
- Yes.
- I like it.

238
00:10:09.835 --> 00:10:11.356
Thanks.

239
00:10:11.443 --> 00:10:14.182
And you must be
the famous human.

240
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:17.182
Human and wolf.
Name's Clawdeen.

241
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:19.966
Love, did you know that cats

242
00:10:20.053 --> 00:10:22.574
have a far more nuanced
sense of smell than dogs?

243
00:10:22.661 --> 00:10:23.922
Meowchachino, please.

244
00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:27.922
And what I smell above all else

245
00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:30.487
is a human at Monster High.

246
00:10:30.574 --> 00:10:32.053
You better get used to it, Tor.

247
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.400
It's how things are now.

248
00:10:33.487 --> 00:10:36.400
And Draculaura, the
witch with fangs.

249
00:10:36.487 --> 00:10:38.053
You're funny.

250
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.530
I have no sense of humor, love.

251
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.356
Oh.

252
00:10:48.704 --> 00:10:50.879
- Monster High's changed, Tor.
- And for the better.

253
00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:53.182
Yes. It's strange coming back.

254
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:54.922
It's like everyone's
forgotten how dangerous

255
00:10:54.922 --> 00:10:56.269
the world really is.

256
00:10:56.356 --> 00:10:58.574
Different doesn't
always mean dangerous.

257
00:10:58.661 --> 00:10:59.966
Really?

258
00:11:00.053 --> 00:11:02.400
I was attacked by
witches in France.

259
00:11:02.487 --> 00:11:05.748
They had daggers made
of wraith silver.

260
00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.792
Oh.

261
00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:13.661
Draculaura never mentioned
wraith silver to you.

262
00:11:13.748 --> 00:11:16.226
It's a witchcraft-forged
metal...

263
00:11:16.313 --> 00:11:19.792
lethal to monsters.

264
00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:24.574
You have no idea how
painful this was.

265
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:26.269
I protected my pack that night,

266
00:11:26.356 --> 00:11:27.879
and I intend to
do the same here.

267
00:11:27.966 --> 00:11:29.966
We also protect our pack.

268
00:11:30.053 --> 00:11:32.835
We just think more monsters
deserve to be in it.

269
00:11:32.922 --> 00:11:34.487
You could come hang out with us.

270
00:11:34.574 --> 00:11:35.922
This Friday is game night.

271
00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:38.792
We have a lot of board games.

272
00:11:40.313 --> 00:11:42.617
Cheers.

273
00:11:45.487 --> 00:11:47.053
Classic Toralei.

274
00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:48.574
Yeah.

275
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:50.966
I guess she doesn't
like board games.

276
00:11:51.053 --> 00:11:53.530
Classic.

277
00:11:53.617 --> 00:11:55.704
Free mops. Get your mops.

278
00:11:55.792 --> 00:11:57.704
Oh. Hey, Growlwool.

279
00:11:57.792 --> 00:11:59.226
Hi, Fantasma.

280
00:11:59.313 --> 00:12:00.661
Hope you got that
roommate you wanted.

281
00:12:00.661 --> 00:12:02.139
Seriously, you're amazing.

282
00:12:02.226 --> 00:12:03.922
You remember everyone.

283
00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:05.661
Got to make everyone
feel welcome.

284
00:12:05.748 --> 00:12:07.356
Who did that for us?

285
00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:08.792
I think we did.

286
00:12:08.879 --> 00:12:10.443
Oh, right.

287
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.356
I remember I was so overwhelmed,

288
00:12:12.443 --> 00:12:14.835
I thought the Coffin Bean
was an actual legume.

289
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.574
Oh!

290
00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:21.182
Sorry.

291
00:12:23.226 --> 00:12:24.574
My new electrical system.

292
00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:27.574
Sometimes it's a
little too responsive.

293
00:12:27.661 --> 00:12:29.400
The other night, I
accidentally shocked my mom

294
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.487
and gave her a perm.

295
00:12:31.574 --> 00:12:32.617
She looks good.

296
00:12:32.704 --> 00:12:34.704
Clawdeen.

297
00:12:36.313 --> 00:12:38.356
Wow. Clawdeen Wolf.

298
00:12:38.443 --> 00:12:39.530
It's really you.

299
00:12:39.617 --> 00:12:41.443
I'm Demi, Demi Bouvier.

300
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.704
Did you get my DM on Eek Tok,
or Spook Book, or Grum Gram?

301
00:12:44.792 --> 00:12:46.052
You're the reason I'm here.

302
00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:48.052
I'm ghost and human.

303
00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:51.139
And you inspired me
to own all of me.

304
00:12:53.617 --> 00:12:55.879
Uh...

305
00:12:55.966 --> 00:12:59.226
I'm solid most of the
time until I get excited.

306
00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:03.269
I used to think I couldn't
tell anyone, but not anymore.

307
00:13:03.356 --> 00:13:06.182
I know the feeling.

308
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:08.226
I made these.

309
00:13:08.313 --> 00:13:09.574
They're human-monster
pride buttons.

310
00:13:09.574 --> 00:13:11.748
We formed a Pride Club.

311
00:13:11.835 --> 00:13:13.443
Would you sign one?

312
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.052
Sure.

313
00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:18.400
Here.

314
00:13:18.487 --> 00:13:20.443
Oh, wow.

315
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.966
I made that too.

316
00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.748
Ghoul has skills.

317
00:13:31.008 --> 00:13:32.226
- Oh.
- Oh. Sorry.

318
00:13:32.313 --> 00:13:33.226
Oh, I'm so sorry.

319
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.095
No, my bad.

320
00:13:35.182 --> 00:13:36.982
Hey, you've got Monster
Lit with Ogre Oberlin.

321
00:13:37.052 --> 00:13:38.313
I hate to break it to you,

322
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.617
but her homework is
legendarily brutal.

323
00:13:40.704 --> 00:13:43.792
Well, uh, nice to
meet a fellow victim.

324
00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:45.661
I'm Ellis, by the way.

325
00:13:45.748 --> 00:13:47.269
Draculaura.

326
00:13:47.356 --> 00:13:49.313
And I'm Frankie.
Pronouns, they/them.

327
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.313
I'm made from a collection
of dead people's body parts.

328
00:13:51.313 --> 00:13:52.748
I'm just one years
old this week.

329
00:13:52.835 --> 00:13:54.008
Uh, nice to meet you.

330
00:13:54.095 --> 00:13:55.922
Ellis. He/him.

331
00:13:56.008 --> 00:13:57.748
Hey, I'm kind of starving.

332
00:13:57.835 --> 00:13:59.313
Where can a vamp get
a bite around here?

333
00:13:59.313 --> 00:14:01.356
Creepeteria. Take the
path to the main hall.

334
00:14:01.443 --> 00:14:03.922
But watch out for the pizza.
Make sure they hold the garlic.

335
00:14:04.008 --> 00:14:05.835
Oh, and the anchovies, please.

336
00:14:05.922 --> 00:14:07.792
Right? Both: Because
they're gross.

337
00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:11.008
Jinx.

338
00:14:11.095 --> 00:14:13.052
I'll see you around, Draculaura.

339
00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:16.052
Frankie.
- Yeah.

340
00:14:16.139 --> 00:14:18.095
He's a vampire too.

341
00:14:18.182 --> 00:14:21.530
Yeah. I noticed, Frankie.

342
00:14:21.617 --> 00:14:23.182
Attention.

343
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:25.965
<i>All students are to
report to the Clawditorium</i>

344
00:14:26.052 --> 00:14:28.139
<i>for a special assembly</i>

345
00:14:28.226 --> 00:14:30.269
<i>immediately after
dinner tonight.</i>

346
00:14:30.356 --> 00:14:33.661
<i>On a related note, dinner
will include piranha soup.</i>

347
00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:36.530
<i>Please eat it
before it eats you.</i>

348
00:14:36.617 --> 00:14:38.661
<i>We mean it. Thank you.</i>

349
00:14:38.748 --> 00:14:41.443
Mm. This is delicious.

350
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.130
I don't know. I think
you're just hungry.

351
00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:44.792
Starving.

352
00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:47.052
OK, there's no time
anymore to eat, to think.

353
00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:49.269
There's always somebody
who needs something.

354
00:14:49.356 --> 00:14:51.879
Popularity... fun,
but exhausting.

355
00:14:51.965 --> 00:14:54.443
Right?

356
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.792
OK, come on. Hand them over.

357
00:14:56.879 --> 00:15:00.052
Oh, come on.

358
00:15:00.139 --> 00:15:01.443
I don't want to turn to stone.

359
00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.835
Sorry.
- Fine. Fine.

360
00:15:02.921 --> 00:15:04.921
Mm-hmm.

361
00:15:05.008 --> 00:15:06.269
Oh. Thank you.

362
00:15:06.356 --> 00:15:08.182
You good?

363
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:09.443
Good.

364
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.182
You look tired.

365
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:17.139
Yeah, I've been arguing
with my mom a lot lately.

366
00:15:17.226 --> 00:15:18.487
Gorga whatever thing again?

367
00:15:18.574 --> 00:15:19.965
Gorgodium. Yeah.

368
00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:21.400
Hey, she can't just expect you

369
00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:22.487
to up and leave school
for a whole year.

370
00:15:22.487 --> 00:15:24.008
It's not fair.

371
00:15:24.095 --> 00:15:26.269
It's what gorgons
do to come of age,

372
00:15:26.356 --> 00:15:29.008
a ritual year to run
wild and find yourself,

373
00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.661
some meditation,
some self-reflection,

374
00:15:31.748 --> 00:15:32.878
with a lot of running around

375
00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.400
and terrorizing the countryside.

376
00:15:34.487 --> 00:15:36.530
See, that doesn't
sound like you.

377
00:15:36.617 --> 00:15:39.182
Yeah, and I keep trying
to tell my mom that,

378
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:42.095
but she just... she
hates Monster High.

379
00:15:42.182 --> 00:15:44.095
She calls it my little cage.

380
00:15:44.182 --> 00:15:46.269
Well, I, for one,

381
00:15:46.356 --> 00:15:48.076
am glad you've decided
to stay in your cage.

382
00:15:48.139 --> 00:15:49.226
Yeah?

383
00:15:49.313 --> 00:15:51.052
Yeah.

384
00:15:51.139 --> 00:15:54.617
But how about a
break for everyone?

385
00:15:59.443 --> 00:16:01.226
Wow.

386
00:16:01.313 --> 00:16:02.792
Thanks.

387
00:16:05.443 --> 00:16:07.921
Uh, I mean... um, this
is not a good idea.

388
00:16:08.008 --> 00:16:09.530
- I...
- Glasses, please.

389
00:16:09.617 --> 00:16:12.617
Yeah. Sorry.

390
00:16:12.704 --> 00:16:15.313
All right. Take
your seats, please.

391
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.487
The assembly is about to begin.

392
00:16:17.574 --> 00:16:20.704
And vampires, do not
hang from the rafters.

393
00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:22.432
You're drooling on the
students below you.

394
00:16:22.487 --> 00:16:24.139
- Hey.
- Take a seat.

395
00:16:24.226 --> 00:16:26.487
- Oh, how's student council?
- My head hurts.

396
00:16:26.574 --> 00:16:29.443
Hey, Clawdeuce. Focus.

397
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.617
When did that catch on?

398
00:16:36.617 --> 00:16:38.487
Good evening, students.

399
00:16:38.574 --> 00:16:40.965
It's a new year and a new moon.

400
00:16:41.052 --> 00:16:43.965
And Monster High
welcomes you back.

401
00:16:50.878 --> 00:16:53.095
Is that normal?

402
00:16:53.182 --> 00:16:55.661
Yeah. The school's
kind of alive.

403
00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:58.269
Don't worry. It's
mostly friendly.

404
00:16:58.356 --> 00:16:59.791
Mostly.

405
00:16:59.878 --> 00:17:01.095
In the manner of
our four founders,

406
00:17:01.095 --> 00:17:04.487
tonight, we embrace
prefecte electio,

407
00:17:04.574 --> 00:17:08.878
the naming of this year's
student leader, your prefect.

408
00:17:08.965 --> 00:17:11.269
As always, your school
will choose the student

409
00:17:11.356 --> 00:17:15.052
it finds most worthy,
an inspiring leader

410
00:17:15.139 --> 00:17:17.834
honorable in both word and deed.

411
00:17:17.921 --> 00:17:19.791
Yeah, except the school
always just picks

412
00:17:19.878 --> 00:17:22.095
the most popular kid.

413
00:17:22.182 --> 00:17:24.008
Let the candidates be revealed.

414
00:17:24.095 --> 00:17:26.182
Elementals.
- That's our cue.

415
00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:27.791
Yes.

416
00:17:27.878 --> 00:17:29.878
As we look to a new year,

417
00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:32.400
we welcome the
elements of change:

418
00:17:32.487 --> 00:17:36.182
fire and water.

419
00:17:49.704 --> 00:17:52.269
Power of fire.

420
00:18:03.661 --> 00:18:06.269
Power of water.

421
00:18:18.008 --> 00:18:21.965
House of spirits,
show us your choices.

422
00:18:33.574 --> 00:18:34.834
Clawdeen Wolf.

423
00:18:36.617 --> 00:18:38.356
What?

424
00:18:38.443 --> 00:18:40.703
Yeah. Way to go, Claw.

425
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:42.791
- Wow.
- Yeah, Clawdeen!

426
00:18:42.878 --> 00:18:45.356
- Whoo!
- Way to go.

427
00:18:50.356 --> 00:18:54.530
Competing with Clawdeen
for prefect will be...

428
00:18:54.617 --> 00:18:57.182
Toralei Stripe.

429
00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:06.530
It's on, Kumon.

430
00:19:06.617 --> 00:19:08.269
Oh, you know it.

431
00:19:12.921 --> 00:19:15.703
So how exactly do we compete?

432
00:19:15.791 --> 00:19:17.747
OK, it's very simple.

433
00:19:17.834 --> 00:19:19.443
These are tally skulls.

434
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.617
As you can see, they start
out pretty equally at first.

435
00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:25.313
But the school is watching
to see who's the best leader.

436
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.313
It's how the school scores
a prefect competition.

437
00:19:27.313 --> 00:19:28.921
It'll observe you
for the next few days

438
00:19:29.008 --> 00:19:30.747
and then make its choice.

439
00:19:30.834 --> 00:19:32.660
First one to the top wins.

440
00:19:32.747 --> 00:19:35.356
My mom was prefect.

441
00:19:35.443 --> 00:19:38.008
I never thought I'd walk
in her shoes like this.

442
00:19:38.095 --> 00:19:40.356
Hey. This is huge for you.

443
00:19:40.443 --> 00:19:43.834
Prefect is the voice of
the whole student body.

444
00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:45.182
Am I even ready for this?

445
00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:47.095
Toralei, were you
excited to be chosen?

446
00:19:47.182 --> 00:19:48.834
Of course, I'm
thrilled to be chosen.

447
00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:51.269
And I already
thought of my slogan,

448
00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.226
"Protect Monsters,"

449
00:19:53.313 --> 00:19:57.400
because that's what
I intend to do.

450
00:19:57.487 --> 00:20:02.487
Tell me, what do you
call an oblivious lycan?

451
00:20:02.574 --> 00:20:05.747
An unaware-wolf.

452
00:20:05.834 --> 00:20:07.052
Oh, yeah. That's good.

453
00:20:09.443 --> 00:20:11.616
Aww.

454
00:20:11.703 --> 00:20:13.443
She can't win.

455
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.182
She can't.

456
00:20:20.182 --> 00:20:22.052
Show what's good
with no mistake,

457
00:20:22.139 --> 00:20:24.965
and on this page,
a likeness make.

458
00:20:33.747 --> 00:20:37.182
"The only way to have
a friend is to be one."

459
00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:40.791
Now we have a slogan of our own.

460
00:20:40.878 --> 00:20:44.008
Thank you.

461
00:20:44.095 --> 00:20:44.756
Aww.

462
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.530
I really need to get
that under control.

463
00:20:49.616 --> 00:20:50.965
- Hey.
- Ah!

464
00:20:51.052 --> 00:20:53.313
Toralei just told the
Gory Gazette that,

465
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.921
"[in English accent] Witchcraft
is a filthy human habit

466
00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:56.139
that puts all
monsters at risk."

467
00:20:56.139 --> 00:20:57.226
What?

468
00:20:57.313 --> 00:20:58.530
They want Clawdeen to comment.

469
00:20:58.616 --> 00:21:00.356
Why, that catty little cat!

470
00:21:00.443 --> 00:21:01.530
Easy.

471
00:21:01.616 --> 00:21:03.573
Breathe.

472
00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.443
Cross my heart, which
is in a jar in my room,

473
00:21:07.529 --> 00:21:12.965
I will handle the press for
you as your campaign manager.

474
00:21:13.052 --> 00:21:14.356
- Thank you.
- All right.

475
00:21:14.443 --> 00:21:15.834
We'll need to hit the
press back with a statement

476
00:21:15.834 --> 00:21:17.139
immediately, something
along the lines of...

477
00:21:17.139 --> 00:21:20.052
OK, we can't let some cat

478
00:21:20.139 --> 00:21:23.269
with trust issues
ruin Monster High.

479
00:21:23.356 --> 00:21:24.834
Let's win this.

480
00:21:30.182 --> 00:21:33.182
"Filthy human habit"?

481
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:36.834
Oh, I'll show her a
filthy human habit.

482
00:21:39.834 --> 00:21:43.139
Dirt and dust and ash and
mud form an ugly hater's mug.

483
00:21:53.616 --> 00:21:55.182
Not too shabby.

484
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:56.703
- Oh! I was...
- It's OK.

485
00:21:56.791 --> 00:21:58.095
I get it.

486
00:21:58.182 --> 00:21:59.486
But I know something
even better.

487
00:21:59.573 --> 00:22:02.008
Check it out.

488
00:22:02.095 --> 00:22:04.703
Bone and breath, hand in heel,

489
00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:07.616
make another one as real.

490
00:22:14.356 --> 00:22:15.791
What?

491
00:22:15.878 --> 00:22:18.616
It's an automaton,
just a dumb copy.

492
00:22:18.703 --> 00:22:20.313
They're hilarious,

493
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.834
but no smarter than the
mask it's made from.

494
00:22:21.834 --> 00:22:23.747
Watch.

495
00:22:28.878 --> 00:22:30.226
- That's...
- Witchcraft.

496
00:22:30.313 --> 00:22:32.182
It's why I transferred here.

497
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:34.095
Ever since I heard
about you, I thought,

498
00:22:34.182 --> 00:22:36.878
maybe it'd be safe
for someone like me.

499
00:22:36.965 --> 00:22:39.442
It was. But now...

500
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:41.747
Less so.

501
00:22:41.834 --> 00:22:43.703
It's so unfair.

502
00:22:43.791 --> 00:22:47.008
Monsters are always afraid of
what they don't understand.

503
00:22:47.095 --> 00:22:48.921
They try to make
you think it's you.

504
00:22:49.008 --> 00:22:50.486
"One day, you'll understand."

505
00:22:50.573 --> 00:22:51.616
Exactly.

506
00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:53.313
You should hear my father.

507
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.747
"One day when you're older,
you can do it your way."

508
00:22:56.834 --> 00:22:59.356
Well, I do understand.

509
00:22:59.442 --> 00:23:01.878
And I want more.

510
00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:03.356
Yeah.

511
00:23:03.442 --> 00:23:05.269
I want them to see what we see,

512
00:23:05.356 --> 00:23:09.052
that witchcraft
can be beautiful.

513
00:23:11.834 --> 00:23:14.878
When I was younger, I
used to go to the library.

514
00:23:14.965 --> 00:23:16.921
There was a dusty corner

515
00:23:17.008 --> 00:23:18.529
stacked with old
forgotten books.

516
00:23:18.616 --> 00:23:21.660
And one day, I found this
little spell book there.

517
00:23:23.182 --> 00:23:25.313
It just spoke to
me. And I knew...

518
00:23:25.399 --> 00:23:27.616
That you could
never tell anyone.

519
00:23:27.703 --> 00:23:29.052
Yes.

520
00:23:29.139 --> 00:23:30.747
I think you get it.

521
00:23:30.834 --> 00:23:33.313

We have to get back.

Draculaura,

562
00:25:20.008 --> 00:25:21.660
I'm glad you're here.

563
00:25:21.747 --> 00:25:24.226
You too, Ellis.

564
00:25:36.486 --> 00:25:39.139
Clawdeen, can I
ask you something?

565
00:25:39.226 --> 00:25:41.182
Frankie, I think we're past

566
00:25:41.268 --> 00:25:42.747
the asking to ask
me something stage.

567
00:25:44.355 --> 00:25:47.095
I'm wondering about my upgrades.

568
00:25:47.182 --> 00:25:50.052
Emerson said the purpose
of life is not to be happy.

569
00:25:50.139 --> 00:25:51.878
It's to be useful,

570
00:25:51.965 --> 00:25:54.268
to have it make some
difference you were here.

571
00:25:54.355 --> 00:25:57.139
That's totally you.

572
00:25:57.226 --> 00:26:01.182
I was just hoping
with my new upgrades,

573
00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:02.703
I just...

574
00:26:02.791 --> 00:26:04.965
I mean, I thought
being more monster

575
00:26:05.052 --> 00:26:07.052
could help me do that too.

576
00:26:07.139 --> 00:26:09.225
You wanted to be more monster

577
00:26:09.312 --> 00:26:11.052
because of Ralph Waldo Emerson?

578
00:26:11.139 --> 00:26:12.355
No.

579
00:26:12.442 --> 00:26:13.573
Yes.

580
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.399
I don't know.

581
00:26:15.486 --> 00:26:16.806
I think I may read
too many books.

582
00:26:20.268 --> 00:26:22.660
Frankie, I'm
sorry. One second.

583
00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:26.486
Cleo is hammering me
with campaign questions.

584
00:26:26.573 --> 00:26:28.442
OK, there. I'm done.

585
00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:31.703
Almost done. Sorry.

586
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:33.834
I know you're super busy.

587
00:26:33.921 --> 00:26:36.442
We'll talk tomorrow.

588
00:26:41.921 --> 00:26:43.161
Please let Bloodgood be asleep.

589
00:26:43.225 --> 00:26:45.095
Please let Bloodgood be asleep.

590
00:27:05.095 --> 00:27:08.878
You missed curfew.

591
00:27:18.225 --> 00:27:20.312
What?

592
00:27:24.486 --> 00:27:26.442
What are you doing here?

593
00:27:49.138 --> 00:27:50.878
<i>What's happening?</i>

594
00:27:50.965 --> 00:27:53.529
So my new eyes are
having focusing issues.

595
00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:56.095
I mean, just yesterday, I
thought Heath was a candle.

596
00:27:56.181 --> 00:27:58.965
But I'm pretty sure
those were witches.

597
00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:01.008
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>

598
00:28:05.878 --> 00:28:08.052
Well, this has been quite
the evening, hasn't it?

599
00:28:08.138 --> 00:28:10.095
A portal was breached

600
00:28:10.181 --> 00:28:13.138
right before Frankie fried
the entire campus power grid.

601
00:28:13.225 --> 00:28:14.355
Sorry about that.

602
00:28:14.442 --> 00:28:17.312
To open a portal,

603
00:28:17.399 --> 00:28:21.312
that would require incredibly
powerful witchcraft.

604
00:28:21.399 --> 00:28:22.703
Oh, thank goodness.

605
00:28:22.791 --> 00:28:25.008
Oh, come on.

606
00:28:25.094 --> 00:28:26.486
Why would witches
invade your room?

607
00:28:26.573 --> 00:28:27.747
I don't know. I
wasn't there, I...

608
00:28:27.747 --> 00:28:29.399
And where were you?

609
00:28:29.486 --> 00:28:31.878
Off partying with your coven?

610
00:28:31.965 --> 00:28:34.225
- What is going on here?
- Are you OK?

611
00:28:34.312 --> 00:28:35.573
Yeah.

612
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.486
Toralei, this is
a private meeting.

613
00:28:37.573 --> 00:28:38.791
It doesn't concern you.

614
00:28:38.878 --> 00:28:40.355
Head mistress, Monster
High was attacked.

615
00:28:40.355 --> 00:28:42.312
That concerns all of us.

616
00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:45.181
And as prefect elect, I'm
entitled to know the facts.

617
00:28:45.268 --> 00:28:47.399
And as the other prefect elect,

618
00:28:47.486 --> 00:28:49.312
why don't you mind
your own beeswax?

619
00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:50.703
Do you think it's a coincidence

620
00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:53.529
that witches came looking
for the one student

621
00:28:53.616 --> 00:28:54.703
known for practicing witchcraft?

622
00:28:54.703 --> 00:28:56.181
Enough. It's late.

623
00:28:56.268 --> 00:28:57.747
Return to your dorms.

624
00:28:57.834 --> 00:28:59.312
Headmistress, hear
me out, please.

625
00:28:59.399 --> 00:29:02.268
Witches and witchcraft
are dangerous.

626
00:29:02.355 --> 00:29:03.965
And I think you know it.

627
00:29:04.051 --> 00:29:06.878
We can't just live in fear
of what we don't understand.

628
00:29:06.965 --> 00:29:08.312
We're better than that.

629
00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:10.834
If you play with
matches, you get burned.

630
00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:14.051
We need to protect monsters

631
00:29:14.138 --> 00:29:17.008

You've both given me
a lot to think about.

685
00:31:59.268 --> 00:32:02.703
I firmly believe in inclusion.

686
00:32:02.791 --> 00:32:05.442
But if witches can
somehow sense witchcraft,

687
00:32:05.529 --> 00:32:09.920
if that's drawing them here,
then until we know more,

688
00:32:10.007 --> 00:32:13.138
I'm enacting a school-wide
ban on all witchcraft.

689
00:32:14.703 --> 00:32:17.355
Now, everyone to bed.

690
00:32:21.442 --> 00:32:24.529
I'm sorry.

691
00:32:27.442 --> 00:32:30.573
Good morning, Monster High.

692
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:34.573
<i>Fearleading tryouts continue
on Skull Field at sundown.</i>

693
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.312
<i>And prefect selection has begun.</i>

694
00:32:37.399 --> 00:32:39.007
<i>The candidates are set,</i>

695
00:32:39.094 --> 00:32:41.486
<i>and the sands of
choice are pouring in.</i>

696
00:32:41.573 --> 00:32:44.442
<i>Who will our great
school choose this year?</i>

697
00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:47.442
<i>Find out in two days.</i>

698
00:32:50.094 --> 00:32:52.703
<i>No. Seriously, two days.</i>

699
00:32:55.529 --> 00:32:57.616
I'm fine, Dad. You
don't need to worry.

700
00:32:57.703 --> 00:33:00.312
<i>You're my little ghoul. Of
course, I need to worry.</i>

701
00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:02.529
<i>If there's any more trouble,
I'm bringing you home.</i>

702
00:33:02.616 --> 00:33:04.051
<i>End of discussion.</i>

703
00:33:04.138 --> 00:33:05.964
Dad, no. That's
totally unreasonable.

704
00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:07.486
Oh, that's my mobile.

705
00:33:07.573 --> 00:33:08.703
<i>Love you.</i>

706
00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:12.355
Perfect.

707
00:33:12.442 --> 00:33:14.268
You OK?

708
00:33:14.355 --> 00:33:15.747
It's not just me
I'm worried about.

709
00:33:15.833 --> 00:33:17.573
There were other witches now.

710
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.833
That transfer student, Ellis...

711
00:33:18.833 --> 00:33:20.033
There's another witch vampire?

712
00:33:20.051 --> 00:33:21.138
Yeah.

713
00:33:21.225 --> 00:33:23.007
He's pretty cool, actually.

714
00:33:23.094 --> 00:33:25.399
We've been talking.

715
00:33:25.486 --> 00:33:27.660
You've just got to win this
prefect thing and end this.

716
00:33:27.747 --> 00:33:29.399
Then...
- Hi.

717
00:33:29.486 --> 00:33:32.442
Hey. Um...

718
00:33:32.529 --> 00:33:34.920
What's up?

719
00:33:35.007 --> 00:33:35.964
What's wrong?

720
00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:41.225
Toralei's pulled ahead,
and not by a little.

721
00:33:41.312 --> 00:33:42.573
- What?
- How?

722
00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.747
I don't know how.

723
00:33:43.833 --> 00:33:47.007
No part of me has
ever been popular.

724
00:33:47.094 --> 00:33:49.920
This can't be happening.
We have to stop her.

725
00:33:50.007 --> 00:33:51.616
How do we stop
her? What do we do?

726
00:33:54.703 --> 00:33:57.442
Draculaura, think about it.

727
00:33:57.529 --> 00:33:59.268
Witches broke in
looking for you.

728
00:33:59.355 --> 00:34:01.747
What if they were
somehow... I don't know,

729
00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:03.138
drawn to your magic,
like Bloodgood said?

730
00:34:03.138 --> 00:34:05.312
I had nothing to do with this.

731
00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:07.790
I know that, but no one's
thinking rationally.

732
00:34:07.877 --> 00:34:09.181
So we need to make them.

733
00:34:09.268 --> 00:34:10.486
I could research the
good witch crafters

734
00:34:10.486 --> 00:34:12.268
in the world and then
post it on Eek Tok.

735
00:34:12.355 --> 00:34:15.181
No one's listening.
They're just afraid.

736
00:34:15.268 --> 00:34:17.094
Right, so that probably
wouldn't be helpful.

737
00:34:17.181 --> 00:34:19.573
Then maybe posters.

738
00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.833
So what are you saying?

739
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.833
Just... witchcraft is banned,

740
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.920
so can't you just play along

741
00:34:28.007 --> 00:34:29.442
until I win and we
can sort this out?

742
00:34:29.442 --> 00:34:30.573
That's a good point.

743
00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.660
Play along?

744
00:34:32.746 --> 00:34:34.186
You mean go back in
the broom closet?

745
00:34:34.225 --> 00:34:35.660
What?

746
00:34:35.746 --> 00:34:37.660
No, that's not what
I said. I just...

747
00:34:37.746 --> 00:34:40.616
I'm a witch. This is who I am.

748
00:34:40.703 --> 00:34:42.616
No apologies, remember?

749
00:34:42.703 --> 00:34:45.616
That's also a good point.

750
00:34:45.703 --> 00:34:47.399
If Toralei wins,

751
00:34:47.486 --> 00:34:50.399
I won't be able to make a
case for acceptance at all.

752
00:34:50.486 --> 00:34:52.007
Yeah.

753
00:34:52.094 --> 00:34:54.355
I get it.

754
00:34:54.442 --> 00:34:57.833
You have monsters to protect.

755
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.181
Wait. No. What?

756
00:35:02.702 --> 00:35:04.660
So that's a no on the posters?

757
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.486
- Oh. Hey.
- Hey.

758
00:35:14.573 --> 00:35:16.790
Can we talk?

759
00:35:16.877 --> 00:35:19.399
It's like everyone
gets to be their best

760
00:35:19.486 --> 00:35:23.399
authentic selves, except us.

761
00:35:23.486 --> 00:35:25.964
It makes me wonder,

762
00:35:26.051 --> 00:35:29.355
what are we even
doing here at all?

763
00:35:29.442 --> 00:35:32.094
Listen.

764
00:35:32.181 --> 00:35:33.312
I need to tell you something.

765
00:35:33.312 --> 00:35:37.442
Just promise me you
won't totally freak out.

766
00:35:37.529 --> 00:35:39.442
Yeah. OK.

767
00:35:39.529 --> 00:35:40.790
OK.

768
00:35:52.181 --> 00:35:53.877
I'm not a vampire.

769
00:35:53.964 --> 00:35:56.659
I'm a human... a human
witch, to be precise.

770
00:35:56.746 --> 00:35:58.702
No, no, no, no.
That's not possible.

771
00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.007
How?
- OK.

772
00:36:00.094 --> 00:36:01.702
Uh, you're freaking
out a little.

773
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.790
- Were you part of the attack?
- No. That wasn't me.

774
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:05.702
Then what do you want?

775
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:07.870
There are different witch
factions, different covens.

776
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.790
Some... most, actually,

777
00:36:10.877 --> 00:36:12.790
want war to destroy
the vampires.

778
00:36:12.877 --> 00:36:14.920
They're the ones who
tried to kidnap you.

779
00:36:15.007 --> 00:36:16.833
But my mother, she's different.

780
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.920
She leads the Salem Coven.

781
00:36:20.007 --> 00:36:22.442
Your mother is Queen Zamara?

782
00:36:22.529 --> 00:36:25.615
Yes. And she wants
peace, like you.

783
00:36:25.702 --> 00:36:27.833
She sent me here to talk to you
before the others found you.

784
00:36:27.833 --> 00:36:30.790
It's just my timing was a mess.

785
00:36:32.615 --> 00:36:34.877
This war is so old.

786
00:36:34.964 --> 00:36:38.051
Not even the undead
remember how it started.

787
00:36:38.138 --> 00:36:41.312
A vampire fell in
love with a witch.

788
00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:45.181
He wanted to be human for
her, so she made him a gift,

789
00:36:45.268 --> 00:36:50.355
a mortality spell
to grant his wish.

790
00:36:50.442 --> 00:36:52.877
But when he cast it,
something went wrong.

791
00:36:52.964 --> 00:36:54.877
It didn't make a vampire human.

792
00:36:54.964 --> 00:36:57.399
It killed vampires instead.

793
00:36:57.486 --> 00:36:59.615
Thousands died.

794
00:36:59.702 --> 00:37:02.790
It was a mortality curse.

795
00:37:02.877 --> 00:37:04.007
The vampires blamed the witches.

796
00:37:04.007 --> 00:37:05.877
And witches blamed vampires.

797
00:37:05.964 --> 00:37:09.746
And centuries of bloodshed
and revenge have followed.

798
00:37:09.833 --> 00:37:12.572
If we can work together now,

799
00:37:12.659 --> 00:37:15.572
we can end this war forever.

800
00:37:15.659 --> 00:37:18.529
My mom wants you to join her
and make the case for peace.

801
00:37:18.615 --> 00:37:22.529
Just hear her out.

802
00:37:37.268 --> 00:37:41.920
♪ There's only one
of two ways to go ♪

803
00:37:42.007 --> 00:37:46.920
♪ And one of them
feels impossible ♪

804
00:37:47.007 --> 00:37:49.528
♪ But I know what feels right ♪

805
00:37:49.615 --> 00:37:52.181
♪ I feel it deep inside ♪

806
00:37:52.268 --> 00:37:57.790
♪ And I think that the
time is getting close ♪

807
00:38:06.268 --> 00:38:08.833
Let's go meet your mom.

808
00:38:11.833 --> 00:38:14.051
<i>Good morning, monsters.</i>

809
00:38:14.138 --> 00:38:17.702
<i>Werecat volleyball is canceled
until all claws are trimmed.</i>

810
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:20.355
<i>We mean it this time,
or no more balls.</i>

811
00:38:20.442 --> 00:38:22.312
<i>There's a casketball
team bake sale</i>

812
00:38:22.399 --> 00:38:24.051
<i>in the main hall at lunch.</i>

813
00:38:24.138 --> 00:38:27.920
<i>And all witchcraft is
banned until further notice.</i>

814
00:38:28.007 --> 00:38:30.790
<i>Go, Demons!</i>

815
00:38:32.094 --> 00:38:34.181
- Is she up?
- I haven't seen her.

816
00:38:37.442 --> 00:38:39.051
What's that?

817
00:38:39.138 --> 00:38:40.833
- Wait, she did what?
- Shh.

818
00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.355
She ran away.
- Why?

819
00:38:42.442 --> 00:38:44.442
She said she's going
to meet with witches

820
00:38:44.528 --> 00:38:46.568
and talk about peace.
- Oh, my Ra. She's gone rogue.

821
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.225
People are not going
to be happy with her.

822
00:38:49.225 --> 00:38:51.225
- Except for Toralei.
- Yeah, witch party?

823
00:38:51.312 --> 00:38:53.181
That cat's going to be stoked.

824
00:38:53.268 --> 00:38:55.485
Draculaura is now a
political millstone.

825
00:38:55.572 --> 00:38:57.399
Cleo, you've got
to cut her loose.

826
00:38:57.485 --> 00:38:59.268
This is not how we
win the prefect race.

827
00:38:59.355 --> 00:39:02.790
Sorry, yeah, but that's
not the worst of it.

828
00:39:10.485 --> 00:39:12.659
She says it's supposed to
fool people into thinking

829
00:39:12.746 --> 00:39:13.702
she's here, but sick.

830
00:39:15.138 --> 00:39:17.790
So it looks like
her, like a clone?

831
00:39:17.877 --> 00:39:20.138
She made it to play
sick and cover for her.

832
00:39:20.225 --> 00:39:23.790
But all it does is
play sick, badly.

833
00:39:23.877 --> 00:39:25.441
So when Bloodgood knocked...

834
00:39:25.528 --> 00:39:27.181
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

835
00:39:27.268 --> 00:39:30.441
Good morning, ghouls.

836
00:39:30.528 --> 00:39:32.355
What a surprise.

837
00:39:32.441 --> 00:39:34.964
So early.

838
00:39:35.051 --> 00:39:37.877
How you are, headmistress?
Miss head... good... good...

839
00:39:37.964 --> 00:39:39.746
head miss...
- I'm good, dears.

840
00:39:39.833 --> 00:39:41.615
Is Draculaura here?

841
00:39:41.702 --> 00:39:44.138
I know yesterday was tough,
so I just wanted to check in.

842
00:39:46.615 --> 00:39:49.051
Um, she's sick.

843
00:39:49.138 --> 00:39:52.007
Sick?

844
00:39:52.094 --> 00:39:53.877
Oh. That kind of sick.

845
00:39:53.964 --> 00:39:55.572
Been there.

846
00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:57.485
Feel better, dear.

847
00:39:57.572 --> 00:39:59.528
- Oh, man.
<i>- So Bloodgood bought it?</i>

848
00:39:59.615 --> 00:40:00.485
We're in the clear?

849
00:40:00.572 --> 00:40:03.355
Yes and no.

850
00:40:03.441 --> 00:40:04.702
It gets worse.

851
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:07.441
Ta-ta.

852
00:40:07.528 --> 00:40:09.485
<i>Draculaura, are you home?</i>

853
00:40:09.572 --> 00:40:12.398
Mr. Dracula.

854
00:40:12.485 --> 00:40:13.225
Hi.

855
00:40:13.312 --> 00:40:14.702
<i>Is my daughter there?</i>

856
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:16.920
She...
- Went out.

857
00:40:19.833 --> 00:40:21.268
<i>Frankie, are you not well?</i>

858
00:40:21.355 --> 00:40:22.485
Yeah.

859
00:40:22.572 --> 00:40:24.877
Just, um, allergies.

860
00:40:27.746 --> 00:40:30.268
And I ate cheese.

861
00:40:30.355 --> 00:40:32.268
<i>Ah.</i>

862
00:40:32.355 --> 00:40:35.355
<i>Well, actually, it's
better I speak to you two.</i>

863
00:40:35.441 --> 00:40:37.441
<i>After all the horrible
business there,</i>

864
00:40:37.528 --> 00:40:39.572
<i>I thought it might be
nice for Draculaura</i>

865
00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:42.964
<i>to celebrate her birthday
the way that she wanted.</i>

866
00:40:43.051 --> 00:40:45.833
<i>So I canceled the big
party I was planning.</i>

867
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.007
<i>And I'm coming tomorrow to
throw her a little soiree</i>

868
00:40:49.094 --> 00:40:50.920
<i>for just her good friends.</i>

869
00:40:51.007 --> 00:40:53.528
<i>She turns 1,600 at midnight.</i>

870
00:40:53.615 --> 00:40:56.051
<i>She will come of age
into full vampireness</i>

871
00:40:56.138 --> 00:40:58.615
<i>exactly as she had hoped.</i>

872
00:40:58.702 --> 00:41:00.615
<i>She's going to be so
very pleased with me.</i>

873
00:41:00.702 --> 00:41:02.441
You're coming here?

874
00:41:02.528 --> 00:41:03.615
<i>Yes.</i>

875
00:41:03.702 --> 00:41:05.485
- Tomorrow?
- OK.

876
00:41:05.572 --> 00:41:07.268
So basically, we have
less than two days

877
00:41:07.354 --> 00:41:09.441
to bring Draculaura home before
she flakes on her own party

878
00:41:09.441 --> 00:41:10.790
and is busted for
sneaking off campus

879
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.051
and conspiring with witches.

880
00:41:12.138 --> 00:41:13.268
And destroys her life forever.

881
00:41:13.268 --> 00:41:15.138
- Good times.
- Yeah.

882
00:41:15.225 --> 00:41:17.181
You sarcopha-got
to be kidding me.

883
00:41:17.268 --> 00:41:19.485
I'm calling her right now.

884
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.833
She left her phone. We
can't even track her.

885
00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.181
"Royal pain"?

886
00:41:27.268 --> 00:41:28.702
So where do we
even begin to look?

887
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:29.920
Aren't there, like,
a ton of covens?

888
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.051
3,017 on six continents.

889
00:41:32.138 --> 00:41:33.485
There was one in Antarctica,

890
00:41:33.572 --> 00:41:35.252
but it got ransacked
by bewitched penguins.

891
00:41:35.311 --> 00:41:37.138
True story. So
probably not that one.

892
00:41:37.225 --> 00:41:40.051
It's OK. I know
where to start.

893
00:41:45.485 --> 00:41:47.572
I probably should
have used less oomph.

894
00:41:47.659 --> 00:41:49.268
Probably?

895
00:41:49.354 --> 00:41:52.615
Breaking and entering is
never good for campaigns.

896
00:41:52.702 --> 00:41:54.138
Ellis is missing too.

897
00:41:54.225 --> 00:41:55.615
If he left with Draculaura,

898
00:41:55.702 --> 00:41:57.572
there might be clues
to where they went.

899
00:41:57.659 --> 00:41:59.181
Spread out.

900
00:41:59.268 --> 00:42:01.094
Sweet.

901
00:42:01.181 --> 00:42:02.790
- Keep watch.
- Right.

902
00:42:02.877 --> 00:42:04.267
And if someone comes, eat them.

903
00:42:04.354 --> 00:42:06.441
Yes. What? No.

904
00:42:06.528 --> 00:42:08.354
Just... just whistle
or knock at the door.

905
00:42:08.441 --> 00:42:10.094
And then take a little nibble?

906
00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:12.485
No. No nibbling.

907
00:42:12.572 --> 00:42:13.572
Aww.

908
00:42:20.528 --> 00:42:21.920
Hey.

909
00:42:22.007 --> 00:42:22.877
His suitcase is still here.

910
00:42:22.877 --> 00:42:24.485
So he left in a hurry.

911
00:42:27.094 --> 00:42:28.659
Nothing.

912
00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:30.615
Wait.

913
00:42:32.485 --> 00:42:34.225
There's something under here.

914
00:42:35.877 --> 00:42:37.833
98134.

915
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.702
Five digits... that's called a
postal code in the human world,

916
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.225
colloquially known as zip codes.

917
00:42:42.311 --> 00:42:43.572
My parts don't know this place.

918
00:42:43.659 --> 00:42:47.051
98134 is in a place
called "Seetle."

919
00:42:47.138 --> 00:42:49.138
Seattle.

920
00:42:49.224 --> 00:42:50.920
Why would a Monster High student

921
00:42:51.007 --> 00:42:52.790
have a secret return
address in the human world?

922
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.224
Who is this guy?

923
00:42:54.311 --> 00:42:56.790
Only one way to find out.

924
00:42:56.877 --> 00:42:59.528
As campaign manager, I'm
aiding in this criminal action

925
00:42:59.615 --> 00:43:00.746
under protest.

926
00:43:00.833 --> 00:43:01.964
Clawdeen, Cleo's right.

927
00:43:02.051 --> 00:43:03.211
It's too dangerous out there.

928
00:43:03.267 --> 00:43:05.007
Believe me. I know.

929
00:43:05.094 --> 00:43:06.441
I'll be careful.

930
00:43:06.528 --> 00:43:09.051
Fine, but you have
to be back by dinner.

931
00:43:09.138 --> 00:43:12.051
We're making 400 Clawdeen
Wolf campaign cookies.

932
00:43:12.138 --> 00:43:14.311
We're using my cake printer
to put your picture on them.

933
00:43:14.311 --> 00:43:15.920
- You have a cake printer?
- Uh-huh.

934
00:43:16.007 --> 00:43:18.138
And you have to hand
them out for dessert.

935
00:43:18.224 --> 00:43:19.833
This is the kind
of student approval

936
00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.181
that you need to get
back in the prefect race.

937
00:43:21.181 --> 00:43:23.398
I know.

938
00:43:23.485 --> 00:43:25.790
I know.

939
00:43:25.877 --> 00:43:28.311
Why do you have to go alone?

940
00:43:28.398 --> 00:43:29.659
Can you do this?

941
00:43:38.267 --> 00:43:41.267
That is still very cool.

942
00:43:41.354 --> 00:43:42.572
You guys wait here, OK?

943
00:43:42.659 --> 00:43:43.964
I'm the human.

944
00:43:44.051 --> 00:43:45.746
This is my job.

945
00:43:45.833 --> 00:43:49.877
Wait. One more thing.

946
00:43:49.964 --> 00:43:52.746
I'm sending this
little gal with you.

947
00:43:52.833 --> 00:43:54.267
Her name is Bastet,

948
00:43:54.354 --> 00:43:56.311
after the Egyptian
goddess of protection.

949
00:43:56.398 --> 00:43:58.180
She can detect magical energy,

950
00:43:58.267 --> 00:44:00.572
which might come in handy
for finding witches.

951
00:44:00.659 --> 00:44:02.485
Good thinking.

952
00:44:02.572 --> 00:44:05.051
Thanks, Cleo.

953
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.094
See you all at dinner.

954
00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.007
Be safe.

955
00:44:12.094 --> 00:44:14.007
Always.

956
00:44:34.094 --> 00:44:36.572
Coleman Eves.

957
00:44:36.659 --> 00:44:39.224
Yo, I just saw
her. She's here.

958
00:44:39.311 --> 00:44:40.746
Dude, I'm not arguing
with you right now.

959
00:44:40.746 --> 00:44:41.964
- Shh.
- You guys are being too loud.

960
00:44:41.964 --> 00:44:43.528
Yeah, um,

961
00:44:43.615 --> 00:44:45.528
just because my human
senses are weak,

962
00:44:45.615 --> 00:44:47.398
doesn't mean they don't exist.

963
00:44:47.485 --> 00:44:48.833
I asked you to wait for me.

964
00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.615
Well, technically,
we never agreed.

965
00:44:50.702 --> 00:44:52.920
- We're here to help.
- I said this was a bad idea.

966
00:44:53.007 --> 00:44:54.615
Yes, it's too dangerous.

967
00:44:54.702 --> 00:44:56.920
That's why we're in disguise.

968
00:44:57.007 --> 00:45:00.180
Sunglasses are not a disguise.

969
00:45:00.267 --> 00:45:04.224
Claws, I couldn't let
you do this alone.

970
00:45:06.051 --> 00:45:08.137
All right.

971
00:45:08.224 --> 00:45:11.311
Well, uh, keep your hoods
up for your own sake.

972
00:45:11.398 --> 00:45:16.311
And just try to
act unnatural, OK?

973
00:45:16.398 --> 00:45:18.441
- OK.
- Yeah.

974
00:45:21.833 --> 00:45:23.877
OK, are you getting this?

975
00:45:23.964 --> 00:45:25.137
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

976
00:45:25.224 --> 00:45:27.093
<i>Coleman Eves.</i>

977
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.137
<i>Green is the color of tomorrow.</i>

978
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:33.615
What's that sound?

979
00:45:33.702 --> 00:45:35.051
It's Heath eating.

980
00:45:35.137 --> 00:45:36.485
Dog meat is fire.

981
00:45:36.572 --> 00:45:38.311
Oh. No, it's not dog.

982
00:45:38.398 --> 00:45:40.398
The name, hot dog was
coined in the 1860s

983
00:45:40.485 --> 00:45:42.180
when German immigrants
began settling

984
00:45:42.267 --> 00:45:44.311
long thin sausages which they
nicknamed dachshund sausages,

985
00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:46.137
like the dog breed.

986
00:45:46.224 --> 00:45:48.441
Dachshund is fire.

987
00:45:48.528 --> 00:45:49.746
OK. Enjoy.

988
00:45:49.833 --> 00:45:51.354
Mm-hmm.

989
00:45:51.441 --> 00:45:53.615
It looks fancy in there.

990
00:45:53.702 --> 00:45:54.920
<i>Coleman Eves...</i>

991
00:45:55.007 --> 00:45:56.485
It is fancy.

992
00:45:56.572 --> 00:46:00.180
<i>Fueled by timeless
botanical secrets.</i>

993
00:46:00.267 --> 00:46:01.920
<i>Wait. Guys.</i>

994
00:46:02.007 --> 00:46:03.833
What's happening?

995
00:46:07.007 --> 00:46:11.615
Guys, I think Bastet
senses magic somewhere.

996
00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:14.528
No. Actually, everywhere.

997
00:46:14.615 --> 00:46:18.050
Wait. Coleman Eves?

998
00:46:18.137 --> 00:46:19.528
It's an anagram.

999
00:46:19.615 --> 00:46:21.964
It's an anagram?
What's an anagram?

1000
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:23.877
It's a word or phrase
that uses the same letters

1001
00:46:23.877 --> 00:46:28.137
to spell different things,
like a secret message.

1002
00:46:28.224 --> 00:46:30.746
Salem Coven. Wait.
The company's a coven?

1003
00:46:30.833 --> 00:46:33.398
The mother of all covens
from the Salem Witch Trials.

1004
00:46:33.485 --> 00:46:36.050
The Salem Witch Trials?

1005
00:46:36.137 --> 00:46:37.964
In 1692 colonial Massachusetts,

1006
00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:40.441
200 people were accused
of practicing witchcraft.

1007
00:46:40.528 --> 00:46:42.441
19 witches were executed.

1008
00:46:42.528 --> 00:46:44.572
So humans treat witches as
bad as they treat monsters?

1009
00:46:44.572 --> 00:46:46.224
Yeah, and witches
treat monsters worse.

1010
00:46:46.311 --> 00:46:47.920
Clawdeen, get out of there now.

1011
00:46:48.006 --> 00:46:49.615
<i>Draculaura is here alone.</i>

1012
00:46:49.702 --> 00:46:51.262
Well, we need a better
plan than walking

1013
00:46:51.311 --> 00:46:53.528
<i>right to the mouth of a coven.</i>

1014
00:46:53.615 --> 00:46:55.833
<i>Claws.
- Coleman Eves.</i>

1015
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.398
<i>- Clawdeen, what's happening?
- To live is to grow.</i>

1016
00:46:58.485 --> 00:47:01.877
I know someone who can help.

1017
00:47:05.398 --> 00:47:06.877
Come on.

1018
00:47:09.093 --> 00:47:12.354
Hi, Mom.
- Ellis. Hi.

1019
00:47:12.441 --> 00:47:16.398
Darling, you're back.

1020
00:47:16.485 --> 00:47:19.702
And, oh, my.

1021
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:21.615
- Oh, um...
- Oh.

1022
00:47:21.702 --> 00:47:24.398
Not a hugger? Forgive me.

1023
00:47:24.485 --> 00:47:27.311
Draculaura, daughter of Dracula,

1024
00:47:27.398 --> 00:47:29.485
princess of vampires,

1025
00:47:29.572 --> 00:47:33.050
and budding practitioner
of our own magical arts.

1026
00:47:33.137 --> 00:47:34.441
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1027
00:47:34.528 --> 00:47:35.963
You too, your majesty.

1028
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:37.963
Oh, that's very proper.

1029
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:39.920
We don't really go for
titles around here.

1030
00:47:40.006 --> 00:47:41.833
It would freak out
the stockholders.

1031
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.702
So just call me Z.

1032
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:47.702
Um, OK. Z.

1033
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.572
Ellis tells me we have a
common interest... peace.

1034
00:47:50.659 --> 00:47:52.224
Yes.

1035
00:47:52.311 --> 00:47:54.963
Monsters and witches
aren't so different.

1036
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:58.877
We've always been persecuted by
those who don't understand us.

1037
00:47:58.963 --> 00:48:00.528
- Are these potions?
- No.

1038
00:48:00.615 --> 00:48:02.180
Those are herbs.

1039
00:48:02.267 --> 00:48:03.790
Magic herbs.

1040
00:48:03.877 --> 00:48:05.398
Just regular herbs.

1041
00:48:05.485 --> 00:48:07.528
We learned a few things.

1042
00:48:07.615 --> 00:48:09.963
People are terrified
of illness and death,

1043
00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:13.877
so we used our craft to design
longevity products for them.

1044
00:48:13.963 --> 00:48:16.050
So you're profiting
off of the fears

1045
00:48:16.137 --> 00:48:17.615
of the very people
that used to fear you?

1046
00:48:17.615 --> 00:48:19.702
Yes. Exactly.

1047
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:22.267
Here. Try this.

1048
00:48:22.354 --> 00:48:24.006
It's turmeric, jasmine,

1049
00:48:24.093 --> 00:48:26.702
and dandelion-infused
rejuvenation elixir.

1050
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:28.790
Your secret botanicals?

1051
00:48:28.877 --> 00:48:31.790
Well, it wouldn't be a secret
if I just told, you would it?

1052
00:48:31.877 --> 00:48:33.267
Cheers.

1053
00:48:35.528 --> 00:48:37.528
I know.

1054
00:48:37.615 --> 00:48:39.093
It's terrible.

1055
00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.746
I've always suspected
it's the dandelion.

1056
00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:45.485
But it is guaranteed to
add years to your life,

1057
00:48:45.572 --> 00:48:47.919
not that you need it.

1058
00:48:48.006 --> 00:48:50.790
This is the type of know-how
that we can share with you.

1059
00:48:50.876 --> 00:48:52.528
We can help each
other if we could just

1060
00:48:52.615 --> 00:48:56.137
get past our conflict.

1061
00:48:56.224 --> 00:48:58.311
I'm not what you expected, am I?

1062
00:48:58.398 --> 00:49:01.093
No. You're definitely not.

1063
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:05.093
Draculaura, I see so
much potential in you

1064
00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:08.572
to be a leader, to
change the world.

1065
00:49:08.659 --> 00:49:13.354
I think it is time that
you learn your true power.

1066
00:49:13.441 --> 00:49:16.267
Tomorrow, witches from
all over the world

1067
00:49:16.354 --> 00:49:18.659
are coming here for a conclave.

1068
00:49:18.746 --> 00:49:20.528
It has always been my dream...

1069
00:49:20.615 --> 00:49:23.398
I can speak to
them, explain that

1070
00:49:23.485 --> 00:49:25.441
not all vampires want war, that
there are reasonable voices

1071
00:49:25.441 --> 00:49:28.006
on our side too.

1072
00:49:28.093 --> 00:49:31.180
That could make
all the difference.

1073
00:49:31.267 --> 00:49:34.485
You are even more
impressive than I expected.

1074
00:49:34.572 --> 00:49:36.137
Thank you.

1075
00:49:36.224 --> 00:49:38.137
We have a beautiful guest
room set up for you.

1076
00:49:38.224 --> 00:49:39.876
Melissandra will show you.

1077
00:49:39.963 --> 00:49:41.180
So rest up.

1078
00:49:41.267 --> 00:49:42.746
We have a big day tomorrow.

1079
00:49:42.832 --> 00:49:45.006
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1080
00:49:45.093 --> 00:49:47.572
Right this way.

1081
00:49:47.659 --> 00:49:49.441
See you later.

1082
00:49:57.267 --> 00:50:00.528
For the record, I think
this is a terrible idea.

1083
00:50:00.615 --> 00:50:02.746
Good to see you too, Dad.

1084
00:50:05.093 --> 00:50:06.398
Thanks for coming.

1085
00:50:06.485 --> 00:50:08.615
Always, little cub.

1086
00:50:08.702 --> 00:50:09.789
Hey, gang.
- Hey, Mr. Wolf.

1087
00:50:09.876 --> 00:50:11.485
- Hey, Mr. Wolf.
- What's up?

1088
00:50:11.572 --> 00:50:13.012
Let's see if we can
find your friend.

1089
00:50:15.354 --> 00:50:16.659
Anybody hungry?

1090
00:50:16.746 --> 00:50:18.311
Dude, you just had,
like, nine hot dogs.

1091
00:50:18.398 --> 00:50:20.267
Dachshunds are small,
right, Frankie?

1092
00:50:20.354 --> 00:50:21.963
B-R-B.

1093
00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.180
No, you're going
to get us caught.

1094
00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.311
Heath.

1095
00:50:24.398 --> 00:50:26.702
Heath. Heath.

1096
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:29.267
It feels like ages since I've
hung out in your work van.

1097
00:50:29.354 --> 00:50:30.746
It has been.

1098
00:50:30.832 --> 00:50:32.832
And the rules haven't changed.

1099
00:50:32.919 --> 00:50:36.006
Both: No eating
over the keyboard.

1100
00:50:37.963 --> 00:50:41.963
OK, Coleman Eves is one
of our bigger clients.

1101
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:44.572
A little mysterious,
but they pay well.

1102
00:50:44.659 --> 00:50:46.528
It's a crazy good
security system.

1103
00:50:46.615 --> 00:50:48.528
- Can you get us past it?
- I hope so.

1104
00:50:48.615 --> 00:50:51.615
I helped build it.

1105
00:50:51.702 --> 00:50:53.963
Since Draculaura has no pulse,

1106
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:56.050
it should be easy to spot her

1107
00:50:56.137 --> 00:50:58.876
using biometric
security filters.

1108
00:50:58.963 --> 00:51:00.832
All these years,
I've never actually

1109
00:51:00.919 --> 00:51:03.137
hunted someone using my tech.

1110
00:51:03.224 --> 00:51:05.354
It's like we're on
a secret mission,

1111
00:51:05.441 --> 00:51:09.093
and I'm the guy, the tech guy.

1112
00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.659
I've always wanted
to be the guy.

1113
00:51:10.745 --> 00:51:12.745
I know. Dad, can we...

1114
00:51:12.832 --> 00:51:15.832
Oh. Right. Sorry. OK.

1115
00:51:15.919 --> 00:51:18.702
Wait. Look at this.

1116
00:51:18.789 --> 00:51:20.963
Bingo.
- Yes.

1117
00:51:22.528 --> 00:51:24.485
OK, let's see where she went.

1118
00:51:29.963 --> 00:51:32.267
- Cleo, hey. What's up?
<i>- Things are a disaster.</i>

1119
00:51:32.354 --> 00:51:33.963
<i>Dinner's over.</i>

1120
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:36.659
Abby and I had to hand out
the cookies, which completely

1121
00:51:36.745 --> 00:51:38.180
backfired because it
made you look like

1122
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.701
an out-of-touch
elitist. Meanwhile...

1123
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:43.701
Hey, how do witches
bake their cookies?

1124
00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:46.050
In a coven.

1125
00:51:46.137 --> 00:51:47.577
We are literally
feeding her material

1126
00:51:47.659 --> 00:51:49.354
to use against us.

1127
00:51:49.441 --> 00:51:50.832
I'm sorry.

1128
00:51:50.919 --> 00:51:52.528
I just need you to cover
for me a little longer.

1129
00:51:52.528 --> 00:51:54.267
How? I need you here.

1130
00:51:54.354 --> 00:51:57.963
Oh, also, not-real
Draculaura isn't helping.

1131
00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:00.441
Draculaura, how are you feeling?

1132
00:52:04.832 --> 00:52:07.701
My. She is ill.

1133
00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:09.659
Look, I'm trying, Cleo.

1134
00:52:09.745 --> 00:52:11.311
<i>Try harder.</i>

1135
00:52:11.398 --> 00:52:13.876
<i>Find Draculaura, and
bring her home now.</i>

1136
00:52:13.963 --> 00:52:15.224
<i>And let's win this.</i>

1137
00:52:15.311 --> 00:52:16.919
I will.

1138
00:52:19.745 --> 00:52:22.615
Hey. You all right?

1139
00:52:22.701 --> 00:52:25.919
It's just...

1140
00:52:26.006 --> 00:52:28.701
there's a lot going on.

1141
00:52:28.789 --> 00:52:31.050
You sound just like your mom.

1142
00:52:31.137 --> 00:52:32.701
She always had a lot going on.

1143
00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:34.832
How did she do it?

1144
00:52:34.919 --> 00:52:37.137
I mean, she was a hero.

1145
00:52:37.224 --> 00:52:39.963
She won prefect.
Everyone loved her.

1146
00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:42.832
What's so funny?

1147
00:52:42.919 --> 00:52:45.006
Your mom was a lot of things,

1148
00:52:45.093 --> 00:52:47.093
but well-liked by everyone
was not one of them.

1149
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:48.832
No.

1150
00:52:48.919 --> 00:52:52.093
She did what she thought was
right, even when it was hard.

1151
00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:56.614
That doesn't always
make you popular.

1152
00:52:56.701 --> 00:52:59.485
OK, are you ready
for some good news?

1153
00:52:59.572 --> 00:53:01.789
Please.

1154
00:53:01.876 --> 00:53:03.528
I think I found her.

1155
00:53:05.485 --> 00:53:07.093
Mmm.

1156
00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.485
That's, like, his 15th hot dog.

1157
00:53:09.572 --> 00:53:11.224
He's a beast.
- Yeah.

1158
00:53:11.311 --> 00:53:13.745
He's, like, the
ultimate monster.

1159
00:53:13.832 --> 00:53:15.528
You both are, actually.

1160
00:53:15.614 --> 00:53:18.267
Oh, I'm ultimate, all right,

1161
00:53:18.354 --> 00:53:21.224
except the only way I can
coexist with non-gorgons

1162
00:53:21.311 --> 00:53:24.658
is if I keep my snakes and
eyes covered every minute.

1163
00:53:24.745 --> 00:53:26.441
So I guess I'm too ultimate.

1164
00:53:32.789 --> 00:53:35.398
When Comos happened,

1165
00:53:35.485 --> 00:53:38.789
I felt like the
opposite of ultimate.

1166
00:53:38.876 --> 00:53:40.093
I couldn't help my friends.

1167
00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:43.398
I didn't have any
real monster powers.

1168
00:53:43.485 --> 00:53:45.701
Now I do,

1169
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:49.789
and I still can't seem to help.

1170
00:53:49.876 --> 00:53:51.658
Are you kidding me?

1171
00:53:51.745 --> 00:53:53.919
Do you have a mirror?

1172
00:53:54.006 --> 00:53:56.267
Frankie, all you do is
help all the time, OK?

1173
00:53:56.354 --> 00:53:58.006
You always show up
with your whole heart.

1174
00:53:58.093 --> 00:54:01.224
And you do right by
the people you love.

1175
00:54:01.311 --> 00:54:03.137
Forget upgrades.

1176
00:54:03.224 --> 00:54:05.441
You've always had a
monster superpower.

1177
00:54:05.528 --> 00:54:07.354
Hey, an amazing one:

1178
00:54:07.441 --> 00:54:10.311
friendship.

1179
00:54:10.398 --> 00:54:12.919
Thanks, Deuce.

1180
00:54:15.267 --> 00:54:18.528
Yo, these humans got
the food thing down.

1181
00:54:18.614 --> 00:54:21.311
Awesome.

1182
00:54:21.398 --> 00:54:23.137
OK.

1183
00:54:23.224 --> 00:54:25.311
Dad found her. We're going in.

1184
00:54:25.398 --> 00:54:26.963
- Sweet.
- Oh.

1185
00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:29.137
Uh, sorry, Heath.
You're staying here.

1186
00:54:29.224 --> 00:54:30.267
What?

1187
00:54:30.354 --> 00:54:32.093
I can't disable the fire alarm.

1188
00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.093
That is less than sweet.

1189
00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:37.614
<i>Go now. You're clear.</i>

1190
00:54:40.354 --> 00:54:41.789
We're in.

1191
00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:45.527
Just the right amount of oomph.

1192
00:54:45.614 --> 00:54:47.658
<i>OK, good.</i>

1193
00:54:47.745 --> 00:54:49.832
Cameras are looped, but they'll
auto reset in 10 minutes.

1194
00:54:49.832 --> 00:54:51.789
Be quick.
<i>- Thanks, Dad.</i>

1195
00:54:54.398 --> 00:54:56.441
Wow.

1196
00:54:56.527 --> 00:54:58.267
I'm a little nervous.

1197
00:54:58.354 --> 00:54:59.267
Are you nervous?

1198
00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:08.832
- Dad, which way?
<i>- Left.</i>

1199
00:55:08.919 --> 00:55:11.093
And then your first right.

1200
00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.137
<i>She's in the East
wing, room 208.</i>

1201
00:55:13.224 --> 00:55:15.398
OK.

1202
00:55:15.484 --> 00:55:17.614
Go. I'll guard our escape.

1203
00:55:26.093 --> 00:55:27.789
This company is huge.

1204
00:55:27.876 --> 00:55:30.441
Coleman Eves' products
are sold around the world.

1205
00:55:30.527 --> 00:55:33.224
Their botanical formulations
are valued at half $1 billion,

1206
00:55:33.311 --> 00:55:34.527
and no one even
knows what's in them.

1207
00:55:34.527 --> 00:55:37.137
Wait.

1208
00:55:40.876 --> 00:55:42.006
Boss is really on a roll.

1209
00:55:42.093 --> 00:55:43.876
Quick, hide.

1210
00:55:45.614 --> 00:55:47.919
This is going to
be quite the party.

1211
00:55:48.006 --> 00:55:50.789
Yeah.

1212
00:55:54.093 --> 00:55:55.484
Big day. Big, big day.

1213
00:55:55.571 --> 00:55:57.093
"On her birthday,

1214
00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.963
she will finally become the
voice of lasting peace"?

1215
00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:03.614
Can Draculaura
really end the war?

1216
00:56:03.701 --> 00:56:05.527
Draculaura?

1217
00:56:05.614 --> 00:56:07.354
Clawdeen?

1218
00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.093
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

1219
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.440
Didn't you get my note?

1220
00:56:10.527 --> 00:56:11.807
I did, but you have to come back

1221
00:56:11.832 --> 00:56:13.571
to campus, like, right now.

1222
00:56:13.658 --> 00:56:15.571
Your dad's coming for
your birthday tomorrow.

1223
00:56:15.658 --> 00:56:18.440
- He is?
- Yeah.

1224
00:56:18.527 --> 00:56:20.311
I can't.

1225
00:56:20.398 --> 00:56:21.527
What?

1226
00:56:21.614 --> 00:56:25.180
I'm speaking at
the Witch Conclave.

1227
00:56:25.267 --> 00:56:27.701
I don't think you're
hearing me, OK?

1228
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:29.354
Your dad is going to lose it.

1229
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.701
Bloodgood is going
to have to expel you.

1230
00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:33.527
This all ends badly.

1231
00:56:33.614 --> 00:56:35.311
I've got a chance to make
the world a better place

1232
00:56:35.311 --> 00:56:37.571
for all witches and vampires.

1233
00:56:37.658 --> 00:56:40.745
I can help everyone.

1234
00:56:40.832 --> 00:56:43.093
Isn't that what you've
always talked about?

1235
00:56:45.701 --> 00:56:49.484
Yeah, but...

1236
00:56:49.571 --> 00:56:52.180
in every story I've
dreamed about my life,

1237
00:56:52.267 --> 00:56:56.440

Keep this with you this time.

1309
01:00:18.397 --> 01:00:19.832
Good luck with prefect.

1310
01:00:22.876 --> 01:00:25.050
Call me when you win.

1311
01:00:48.919 --> 01:00:50.963
<i>Good afternoon, monsters.</i>

1312
01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:54.006
<i>Who is most worthy
to lead Monster High?</i>

1313
01:00:54.093 --> 01:00:57.050
<i>Final prefect speeches
are about to begin.</i>

1314
01:00:57.136 --> 01:01:00.266
<i>Don't be late. I mean it.</i>

1315
01:01:29.963 --> 01:01:33.701
<i>All: Hey-hey, ho-ho,
every witch has got to go.</i>

1316
01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:37.571
Hey-hey, ho-ho, every
witch has got to go.

1317
01:01:37.658 --> 01:01:39.701
Hey-hey, ho-ho...

1318
01:01:39.789 --> 01:01:42.745
Oh, my Ra. Listen
to them, Clawdeen.

1319
01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:44.963
You have to tell them
what they want to hear,

1320
01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.789
or else they will eat you alive.

1321
01:01:47.876 --> 01:01:49.092
Sorry.

1322
01:01:49.179 --> 01:01:51.310
That... that was a
little scary sounding.

1323
01:01:51.397 --> 01:01:53.614
Pep talks are new for me.

1324
01:01:53.701 --> 01:01:55.876
But seriously, they
will eat you alive.

1325
01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:58.789
All: Ho-ho, every
witch has got to go.

1326
01:02:00.963 --> 01:02:04.397
Thank you, fellow monsters.

1327
01:02:04.484 --> 01:02:06.353
Toralei Stipe.

1328
01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.353
Thank you, Toralei.

1329
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.440
Now, please welcome our
second prefect candidate,

1330
01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:13.310
Clawdeen Wolf.

1331
01:02:20.919 --> 01:02:22.701
Go, Clawdeen.

1332
01:02:27.049 --> 01:02:31.266
Witches are the enemy.

1333
01:02:31.353 --> 01:02:34.179
Witches are evil.

1334
01:02:34.266 --> 01:02:36.440
The only good witch is
a dead witch, right?

1335
01:02:41.179 --> 01:02:43.136
Humans said that
about witches too.

1336
01:02:43.223 --> 01:02:46.006
They feared and hunted them,

1337
01:02:46.092 --> 01:02:50.006
just like they feared
and hunted monsters.

1338
01:02:50.092 --> 01:02:53.353
If anyone understands what
it is like to be hated,

1339
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.614
to be persecuted, it's us.

1340
01:02:56.701 --> 01:02:59.745
That's why we need to
stand against ignorance,

1341
01:02:59.832 --> 01:03:02.832
against fear and stand
up for the marginalized

1342
01:03:02.919 --> 01:03:07.527
and misunderstood.

1343
01:03:07.614 --> 01:03:11.005
My best friend
practices witchcraft,

1344
01:03:11.092 --> 01:03:13.092
and I'm proud of her.

1345
01:03:13.179 --> 01:03:16.658
She is one of us,
and she is good.

1346
01:03:16.745 --> 01:03:19.527
So I'm standing up for
her and for anyone,

1347
01:03:19.614 --> 01:03:21.658
monster, human, witch,

1348
01:03:21.745 --> 01:03:23.876
who believes that
ancient prejudices

1349
01:03:23.963 --> 01:03:27.005
are less important
than who we are now.

1350
01:03:27.092 --> 01:03:29.266
Who's with me?

1351
01:03:39.745 --> 01:03:43.136
<i>My best friend
practices witchcraft,</i>

1352
01:03:43.223 --> 01:03:44.527
<i>and I'm proud of her.</i>

1353
01:03:44.614 --> 01:03:45.745
Come in.

1354
01:03:45.832 --> 01:03:47.049
<i>She is one of us...</i>

1355
01:03:47.136 --> 01:03:48.440
Hey.

1356
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:53.266
I got your text. What's up?

1357
01:03:53.353 --> 01:03:55.179
Listen, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

1358
01:03:55.266 --> 01:03:57.005
I believe in peace. I do.

1359
01:03:57.092 --> 01:03:59.353
But right now, I have
to get back to school.

1360
01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.136
But why?

1361
01:04:02.223 --> 01:04:03.876
My friends, they need me.

1362
01:04:03.962 --> 01:04:07.179
And I need them.

1363
01:04:07.266 --> 01:04:11.005
I'm sorry. That's
not possible.

1364
01:04:11.092 --> 01:04:13.136
I'll come right back.

1365
01:04:13.223 --> 01:04:15.223
We can still speak
to the conclave.

1366
01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:17.397
It's funny.

1367
01:04:17.484 --> 01:04:18.962
As smart as you
are, you still think

1368
01:04:19.049 --> 01:04:20.919
you're a guest
here, when actually,

1369
01:04:21.005 --> 01:04:23.440
you've been a
prisoner all along.

1370
01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:27.397
You.

1371
01:04:27.484 --> 01:04:30.484
Our original idea was to
just kidnap you outright.

1372
01:04:30.571 --> 01:04:32.962
Ellis was just there
to open the portal.

1373
01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:35.179
But when your friends
got in the way,

1374
01:04:35.266 --> 01:04:37.484
well, we had to improvise.

1375
01:04:37.571 --> 01:04:41.049
So it was all a lie.

1376
01:04:41.136 --> 01:04:44.179
It was a means to an end.

1377
01:04:44.266 --> 01:04:46.353
Take her.

1378
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.136
I have very special
plans for you.

1379
01:04:56.527 --> 01:04:58.571
<i>Thank you, students.
A reminder...</i>

1380
01:04:58.658 --> 01:05:01.789
What's your game, Wolf?

1381
01:05:01.876 --> 01:05:03.876
- Sorry?
- You're up to something.

1382
01:05:03.962 --> 01:05:05.918
What's your angle?
- No angle.

1383
01:05:06.005 --> 01:05:08.353
I just finally found my truth.

1384
01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.789
- Mm.
- Congratulations.

1385
01:05:09.876 --> 01:05:11.092
You win.

1386
01:05:19.179 --> 01:05:20.527
What is it?

1387
01:05:20.614 --> 01:05:22.658
Something's wrong?

1388
01:05:22.745 --> 01:05:25.614
Bastet is still at the coven.

1389
01:05:25.701 --> 01:05:27.527
She's sending a warning.

1390
01:05:27.614 --> 01:05:29.223
Coven?

1391
01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:31.136
- It's Draculaura.
- What's going on?

1392
01:05:31.223 --> 01:05:33.049
- Our friend is in trouble.
- With witches.

1393
01:05:33.136 --> 01:05:35.005
Wait, I overheard
them explaining

1394
01:05:35.092 --> 01:05:38.658
how Draculaura will be...

1395
01:05:38.745 --> 01:05:40.745
- Come again?
- It's French.

1396
01:05:40.832 --> 01:05:42.789
"The voice of eternal peace."
- Yes. Yes.

1397
01:05:42.875 --> 01:05:44.310
But there's another translation:

1398
01:05:44.397 --> 01:05:46.658
"the voice of eternal rest."

1399
01:05:46.745 --> 01:05:48.266
The mortality curse.

1400
01:05:48.353 --> 01:05:50.092
Wait, the spell that started
the vampire-witch war?

1401
01:05:50.092 --> 01:05:53.223
The story says a
vampire cast it.

1402
01:05:53.310 --> 01:05:56.049
It was too powerful.
It ended eternal life.

1403
01:05:56.136 --> 01:05:58.484
But it's just a legend, right?

1404
01:05:58.571 --> 01:06:02.049
How could a spell that
powerful exist and no one know?

1405
01:06:02.136 --> 01:06:04.136
There were rumors back in France

1406
01:06:04.223 --> 01:06:08.571
that witches were
searching for it.

1407
01:06:08.658 --> 01:06:10.266
The mortality curse is real.

1408
01:06:10.353 --> 01:06:12.614
And they figured out a
way to cast it again...

1409
01:06:12.701 --> 01:06:14.179
Using Draculaura.

1410
01:06:14.266 --> 01:06:16.092
"The voice of eternal peace."

1411
01:06:16.179 --> 01:06:20.310
This was their plan all
along... to kill all vampires.

1412
01:06:20.397 --> 01:06:22.353
They said it would
happen on her birthday...

1413
01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:26.179
When she comes of age
at midnight tonight.

1414
01:06:26.266 --> 01:06:28.614
I told you, Wolf.

1415
01:06:40.484 --> 01:06:42.658
Let go of me.

1416
01:06:46.397 --> 01:06:47.745
What is this place?

1417
01:06:47.831 --> 01:06:50.918
The heart of Coleman Eves.

1418
01:06:51.005 --> 01:06:53.179
Oh, she was just a tiny seedling

1419
01:06:53.266 --> 01:06:56.745
when she was pulled from the
very soil of hate itself,

1420
01:06:56.831 --> 01:07:01.571
Salem, Massachusetts 1693.

1421
01:07:01.658 --> 01:07:05.440
- 19 witches died at Salem.
- Yes.

1422
01:07:05.527 --> 01:07:09.049
Their lives were ended by
fear and ignorance, by hate.

1423
01:07:09.136 --> 01:07:11.440
Zamara, listen to me...

1424
01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:14.962
Wraith silver.

1425
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:17.223
Isn't it clever how it
only hurts monsters?

1426
01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:19.005
Why are you doing this?

1427
01:07:19.092 --> 01:07:20.658
I'm sure daddy told
you that old story

1428
01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:22.484
about the mortality curse?

1429
01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:25.092
Turns out it's real.

1430
01:07:25.179 --> 01:07:27.397
And tonight, you get to cast it.

1431
01:07:27.484 --> 01:07:29.179
What?

1432
01:07:29.266 --> 01:07:31.353
You'll kill us all...
my father, my family.

1433
01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.701
Now you get it.

1434
01:07:32.788 --> 01:07:35.266
You see? I wasn't lying.

1435
01:07:35.353 --> 01:07:37.875
I do want peace.

1436
01:07:37.962 --> 01:07:39.353
But what better
way to achieve it

1437
01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:42.310
than by destroying your
enemies once and for all?

1438
01:07:42.397 --> 01:07:45.223
Mom, we were just going
to blackmail Dracula.

1439
01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:47.484
This... this was not
part of our plan.

1440
01:07:47.571 --> 01:07:52.701
This was always part of my plan!

1441
01:07:52.788 --> 01:07:54.397
Sorry.

1442
01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:01.266
Dad, what's happening?

1443
01:08:01.353 --> 01:08:03.614
Have you found her?
<i>- Yes, and it's not good.</i>

1444
01:08:03.701 --> 01:08:06.397
They've got her in a
subbasement lab of some kind.

1445
01:08:06.484 --> 01:08:08.700
Sweetie, they've got a cage.

1446
01:08:08.788 --> 01:08:10.571
We have to call the police.

1447
01:08:10.658 --> 01:08:12.266
And say what? Hi.

1448
01:08:12.353 --> 01:08:14.092
You know those nice folks who
make your smoothie powder?

1449
01:08:14.092 --> 01:08:15.918
They're actually witches
holding a vampire

1450
01:08:16.005 --> 01:08:17.962
in their creepy basement layer.

1451
01:08:18.049 --> 01:08:20.092
Dad, we need you.
You're the guy.

1452
01:08:22.571 --> 01:08:23.918
<i>OK, I'm the guy.</i>

1453
01:08:24.005 --> 01:08:26.788
I get it. I'll be ready.

1454
01:08:26.875 --> 01:08:28.527
Thanks.

1455
01:08:28.614 --> 01:08:31.179
I'm coming with you.

1456
01:08:31.266 --> 01:08:33.484
Draculaura's one of
us, and I can help.

1457
01:08:33.571 --> 01:08:35.092
I know a thing or two
about fighting witches.

1458
01:08:35.092 --> 01:08:38.788
Plus, I have a score to settle.

1459
01:08:38.875 --> 01:08:42.136
That could come
in handy. Come on.

1460
01:09:11.049 --> 01:09:13.266
Move it, stud. I
can't drive stick.

1461
01:09:13.353 --> 01:09:15.136
Right.

1462
01:09:15.223 --> 01:09:18.571
We've been watching you
a long time, Draculaura,

1463
01:09:18.657 --> 01:09:20.484
nurturing your passions.

1464
01:09:20.571 --> 01:09:22.484
Did you think it was an
accident that you found

1465
01:09:22.571 --> 01:09:24.049
that spell book as a child?

1466
01:09:24.136 --> 01:09:27.223
It was all for this moment.

1467
01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:29.657
The mortality curse can
only be cast by a vampire

1468
01:09:29.744 --> 01:09:31.571
who's come of age.

1469
01:09:31.657 --> 01:09:34.397
I told you you would
learn your true power.

1470
01:09:36.049 --> 01:09:38.179
Happy birthday, by the way.
- Please.

1471
01:09:38.266 --> 01:09:40.092
If you do this, this
war will never end.

1472
01:09:40.179 --> 01:09:42.049
All monsters will come for you.

1473
01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.179
It won't just be
vampires anymore.

1474
01:09:44.266 --> 01:09:45.962
Ellis, tell her.
- Mom, please.

1475
01:09:46.049 --> 01:09:48.049
Ellis, one day,
you'll understand.

1476
01:09:48.136 --> 01:09:51.136
No, you do understand,
Ellis, right now, today.

1477
01:09:51.223 --> 01:09:55.049
So aspirational, and
at such a bleak time.

1478
01:09:55.136 --> 01:09:56.092
Brava.

1479
01:09:58.527 --> 01:10:00.700
And goodbye.

1480
01:10:00.788 --> 01:10:03.744
And now it's time
a second spell.

1481
01:10:03.831 --> 01:10:06.962
And I control your mind as well.

1482
01:10:17.484 --> 01:10:18.788
Minutes away.

1483
01:10:18.875 --> 01:10:22.440
Tick tock. Tick tock.

1484
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:34.875
They never learn.

1485
01:10:34.962 --> 01:10:37.397
OK, everyone got the plan?

1486
01:10:37.484 --> 01:10:39.310
Yeah, we're going down.

1487
01:10:39.397 --> 01:10:42.049
You're going down.
You're going way down.

1488
01:10:47.788 --> 01:10:49.570
<i>The lab is to your right.</i>

1489
01:10:49.657 --> 01:10:52.092
<i>And I'm turning all cameras
back to live in 30 seconds.</i>

1490
01:10:52.179 --> 01:10:55.527
<i>Be ready.</i>
- Thanks, Dad.

1491
01:10:55.613 --> 01:10:58.484
OK. You heard the man.

1492
01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:01.049
Have fun.
- Oh, we will.

1493
01:11:05.613 --> 01:11:06.744
Ready to make some mischief?

1494
01:11:06.831 --> 01:11:10.353
Absolutely.

1495
01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.700
I say we start small.

1496
01:11:13.788 --> 01:11:15.962
Build.

1497
01:11:26.005 --> 01:11:28.440
There's someone in G. Smoke.

1498
01:11:28.526 --> 01:11:32.179
Pull it up.

1499
01:11:32.266 --> 01:11:33.744
<i>It's a little smoky down here.</i>

1500
01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:35.049
<i>You want to send someone?</i>

1501
01:11:35.136 --> 01:11:36.353
<i>Yeah. I can feel
it on my eyes.</i>

1502
01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.526
<i>Yeah. Something's
happening down here.</i>

1503
01:11:38.613 --> 01:11:40.570
Let's go.

1504
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:46.962
OK.

1505
01:11:47.049 --> 01:11:48.483
The smart move is
to come quietly,

1506
01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:50.266
but you two don't
look that smart.

1507
01:11:50.353 --> 01:11:52.179
Guilty.

1508
01:12:02.788 --> 01:12:05.570
I guess a gorgon's not much
without his killer eyes.

1509
01:12:05.657 --> 01:12:07.440
Clearly, you don't know gorgons.

1510
01:12:17.744 --> 01:12:19.788
Coffin thumbs.

1511
01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.353
<i>Draculaura, I'm
here at your school.</i>

1512
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.310
<i>Where are you?</i>

1513
01:12:27.397 --> 01:12:29.397
<i>Zamara.</i>

1514
01:12:29.483 --> 01:12:30.700
Hi, Dracula.

1515
01:12:30.788 --> 01:12:32.831
<i>- Where is my daughter?</i>
- Oh, she's fine.

1516
01:12:32.918 --> 01:12:35.831
She's comfortable
for the moment.

1517
01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:37.875
<i>What have you done?</i>

1518
01:12:37.962 --> 01:12:39.136
<i>If you hurt her, I swear...</i>

1519
01:12:39.223 --> 01:12:41.223
Shh, shh, shh, no time
for empty threats.

1520
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:43.397
You only have a
few minutes left.

1521
01:12:43.483 --> 01:12:45.310
You see, she's casting
the mortality curse...

1522
01:12:45.397 --> 01:12:46.700
<i>No.</i>

1523
01:12:46.788 --> 01:12:49.136
- Which in seven minutes...
<i>- Zamara.</i>

1524
01:12:49.223 --> 01:12:51.310
Will end you and all
your kind forever.

1525
01:12:51.397 --> 01:12:53.831
<i>No, no. You don't have
to do this, Zamara.</i>

1526
01:12:53.918 --> 01:12:55.223
I just wanted to see your face

1527
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:56.831
when you and your
daughter suddenly age

1528
01:12:56.918 --> 01:12:58.613
and turn to dust.
<i>- No!</i>

1529
01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.353
- We have a situation.
<i>- No. Talk to me.</i>

1530
01:13:01.439 --> 01:13:03.526
<i>- Help me!
- She's been bitten!</i>

1531
01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:06.962
<i>Get her out of here.</i>

1532
01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:10.179
I will handle this myself.

1533
01:13:10.266 --> 01:13:12.005
<i>- Listen to me.</i>
- Goodbye, Dracula.

1534
01:13:12.092 --> 01:13:14.223
<i>Zamara, Zamara, Zamara!</i>

1535
01:13:25.396 --> 01:13:28.831
Make sure she keeps chanting.

1536
01:13:35.092 --> 01:13:37.136
Stay here. No one gets in.

1537
01:13:37.223 --> 01:13:40.700
- Understood.
- No one.

1538
01:13:40.788 --> 01:13:42.831
She seems tense.

1539
01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:43.918
Cheers.

1540
01:13:45.831 --> 01:13:48.396
You're going to regret that.

1541
01:13:51.092 --> 01:13:53.526
Yeah, I'm not feeling regret.
More of a thrill, actually.

1542
01:13:53.613 --> 01:13:55.005
See ya.

1543
01:13:58.570 --> 01:14:00.875
Come on.

1544
01:14:00.962 --> 01:14:02.352
No.

1545
01:14:02.439 --> 01:14:04.483
11:57. We're out of time.

1546
01:14:12.266 --> 01:14:16.005
Frankie, I can't do it.

1547
01:14:16.092 --> 01:14:17.613
Come on!

1548
01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:19.266
Open!

1549
01:14:19.352 --> 01:14:21.005
Parametric blocks are
coded to unique users.

1550
01:14:21.005 --> 01:14:23.092
You know that.

1551
01:14:23.179 --> 01:14:25.266
- There has to be a way.
- Think.

1552
01:14:25.352 --> 01:14:28.526
Locks. How do you break
an unbreakable lock?

1553
01:14:28.613 --> 01:14:29.700
I've got it.

1554
01:14:29.788 --> 01:14:31.049
Two of my favorite books.

1555
01:14:31.136 --> 01:14:33.657
What? What are you doing?

1556
01:14:33.744 --> 01:14:36.788
Advanced Electrical Theory
and Applied Monster Physics.

1557
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:39.788
Get down.

1558
01:14:57.309 --> 01:14:59.744
Stop. Please stop.

1559
01:14:59.831 --> 01:15:01.526
We are just trying
to save our friend.

1560
01:15:01.613 --> 01:15:02.788
Ellis, please.

1561
01:15:02.875 --> 01:15:04.223
Sorry.

1562
01:15:07.744 --> 01:15:10.092
Well done, Ellis.

1563
01:15:10.179 --> 01:15:13.526
And you two, I am impressed.

1564
01:15:13.613 --> 01:15:14.875
I really am.

1565
01:15:14.962 --> 01:15:16.570
It's a very delicate spell.

1566
01:15:16.657 --> 01:15:18.309
The slightest touch
would have woken her.

1567
01:15:18.396 --> 01:15:20.179
You almost succeeded.

1568
01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:25.831
But now, children,
the fun is over.

1569
01:15:25.918 --> 01:15:29.657
It's time for you to die...

1570
01:15:33.005 --> 01:15:36.439
Hurry. I can't hold her.

1571
01:15:41.918 --> 01:15:43.570
Wraith silver.
- You can't touch it.

1572
01:15:43.657 --> 01:15:45.483
It'll destroy you.

1573
01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:48.962
Draculaura, please wake up!

1574
01:15:54.136 --> 01:15:55.700
We're out of time.

1575
01:15:55.788 --> 01:15:56.657
No. No.

1576
01:15:56.744 --> 01:15:59.092
No! No!

1577
01:15:59.179 --> 01:16:01.570
Clawdeen. No, Clawdeen!

1578
01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:03.396
Stop, please.

1579
01:16:03.483 --> 01:16:06.439
There's got to be another way.

1580
01:16:06.526 --> 01:16:09.005
I can't hold her.
She's too strong.

1581
01:16:12.049 --> 01:16:14.831
No!

1582
01:16:16.483 --> 01:16:20.092
No!

1583
01:16:33.439 --> 01:16:35.831
Clawdeen?

1584
01:16:35.918 --> 01:16:38.352
Clawdeen.

1585
01:16:38.439 --> 01:16:41.744
Clawdeen, wake up.

1586
01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:44.265
Clawdeen.

1587
01:16:44.352 --> 01:16:45.831
Clawdeen, don't leave me.

1588
01:16:47.483 --> 01:16:51.178
<i>Draculaura, I think she's dying.</i>

1589
01:17:02.570 --> 01:17:04.222
This is so good.

1590
01:17:04.309 --> 01:17:06.049
I can't handle it.

1591
01:17:12.092 --> 01:17:13.875
Literally, like, two whole days.

1592
01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:24.439
I am the reaper.
I've come for you.

1593
01:17:24.526 --> 01:17:27.136
Please. I'm not ready.

1594
01:17:27.222 --> 01:17:28.483
<i>- Clawdeen.</i>
- Frankie?

1595
01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:30.265
<i>Clawdeen, wake up.</i>

1596
01:17:30.352 --> 01:17:32.962
- Frankie!
- The dead must rest.

1597
01:17:33.049 --> 01:17:35.570
Surrender, Clawdeen Wolf.

1598
01:17:35.657 --> 01:17:39.657
Surrender?

1599
01:17:39.744 --> 01:17:41.700
Surrender?

1600
01:17:41.788 --> 01:17:44.352
That means...

1601
01:17:47.657 --> 01:17:49.700
That I have a choice.

1602
01:17:49.788 --> 01:17:52.875
<i>- Clawdeen.</i>
- Frankie, I'm here.

1603
01:17:52.962 --> 01:17:54.657
<i>Clawdeen, don't leave
me. Don't leave me.</i>

1604
01:17:54.744 --> 01:17:56.526
<i>Wake up. Please wake up.</i>

1605
01:17:56.613 --> 01:17:58.049
<i>Please wake up.</i>

1606
01:18:57.396 --> 01:19:01.352
Clawdeen?

1607
01:19:01.439 --> 01:19:04.048
Hey.

1608
01:19:04.135 --> 01:19:05.570
Hey.

1609
01:19:05.657 --> 01:19:07.396
Deuce, she's awake.

1610
01:19:07.483 --> 01:19:09.570
Hey, you. You OK?

1611
01:19:09.657 --> 01:19:12.483
Still in one piece.

1612
01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:14.570
Oh, man.

1613
01:19:14.657 --> 01:19:16.396
More or less.

1614
01:19:16.483 --> 01:19:17.439
Let's get you up.

1615
01:19:17.526 --> 01:19:19.005
Yeah. Come on.

1616
01:19:20.918 --> 01:19:23.875
- You good?
- Yeah.

1617
01:19:23.962 --> 01:19:25.352
What happened?

1618
01:19:25.439 --> 01:19:27.265
It was all Draculaura.

1619
01:19:27.352 --> 01:19:30.744
When you woke her,
it was unbelievable.

1620
01:19:30.831 --> 01:19:32.951
Yeah, she opened up a major
can of witch butt whooping

1621
01:19:33.005 --> 01:19:34.744
on everyone.

1622
01:19:34.831 --> 01:19:37.788
It was fantastic, witchcraft
used by the good guys.

1623
01:19:37.875 --> 01:19:40.918
Apology accepted, Tor.

1624
01:19:49.135 --> 01:19:52.309
Both: I'm sorry.

1625
01:19:52.396 --> 01:19:54.178
Jinx.

1626
01:19:56.265 --> 01:19:59.352
Draculaura!

1627
01:19:59.439 --> 01:20:00.875
Duty calls.

1628
01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:02.352
What did she do to you?

1629
01:20:02.439 --> 01:20:03.831
Are you hurt? Are
you all right?

1630
01:20:03.918 --> 01:20:07.657
Dad, I'm OK. Everything's OK.

1631
01:20:07.744 --> 01:20:09.396
And I've got a few
high-profile prisoners

1632
01:20:09.483 --> 01:20:11.178
for you to deal with.

1633
01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:13.091
Oh, I will.

1634
01:20:13.178 --> 01:20:16.309
I most certainly will.

1635
01:20:16.396 --> 01:20:20.222
My little ghoul is growing up...

1636
01:20:20.309 --> 01:20:22.222
so quickly.

1637
01:20:24.788 --> 01:20:26.961
Zamara.
- Hello, Dracula.

1638
01:20:27.048 --> 01:20:28.570
Still with the cape?
- Hey.

1639
01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.875
It's a cloth.
Superheroes wear capes.

1640
01:20:30.961 --> 01:20:33.178
Uh, I'm sorry.

1641
01:20:33.265 --> 01:20:36.483
I had no idea.

1642
01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:38.657
I know.

1643
01:20:38.744 --> 01:20:43.048
But you did the right
thing when it counted.

1644
01:20:43.135 --> 01:20:47.309
Thank you.

1645
01:20:47.396 --> 01:20:50.135
So how about we make
this the beginning

1646
01:20:50.222 --> 01:20:52.613
of that new era of peace?

1647
01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:54.875
Deal?

1648
01:20:54.961 --> 01:20:57.352
Deal.

1649
01:20:57.439 --> 01:20:59.396
See you around, Ellis.

1650
01:20:59.483 --> 01:21:01.309
See you around, Draculaura.

1651
01:21:04.135 --> 01:21:05.744
Nice moves, D.

1652
01:21:05.831 --> 01:21:07.004
Not too shabby.

1653
01:21:07.091 --> 01:21:09.700
OK, tell me exactly
what happened.

1654
01:21:09.788 --> 01:21:11.048
She can summon bats.

1655
01:21:11.135 --> 01:21:13.613
It was fire.

1656
01:21:17.657 --> 01:21:19.526
Nice.

1657
01:21:19.613 --> 01:21:21.396
I think I finally got my
new upgrades under control.

1658
01:21:21.396 --> 01:21:23.265
I always knew you would.

1659
01:21:23.352 --> 01:21:25.613
Thanks.

1660
01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:29.091
Looks like you got that
party you wanted after all.

1661
01:21:29.178 --> 01:21:31.439
It's perfect.

1669
01:21:50.004 --> 01:21:52.875
Bloodgood's about to
announce the prefect results.

1670
01:21:55.396 --> 01:21:57.048
I'm OK.

1671
01:22:04.178 --> 01:22:06.048
Come on. Let's go.

1672
01:22:12.657 --> 01:22:15.570
Attention, students.

1673
01:22:15.657 --> 01:22:18.961
Let's see if I got my wish.

1674
01:22:19.048 --> 01:22:23.048
In our school's grand
tradition of prefecte electio,

1675
01:22:23.135 --> 01:22:24.831
the moment has come.

1676
01:22:27.657 --> 01:22:32.526
This year's student
prefect is...

1677
01:22:32.613 --> 01:22:34.613
Clawdeen Wolf.

1678
01:22:46.265 --> 01:22:47.874
Hey, Kumon.

1679
01:22:50.004 --> 01:22:52.091
You protected your pack,

1680
01:22:52.178 --> 01:22:55.483
even when the school
hated you for it.

1681
01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.744
That took guts, prefect.

1682
01:23:07.526 --> 01:23:10.396
Looks like you've got a
few scars of your own now.

1683
01:23:10.483 --> 01:23:13.744
Well, I guess, we finally
have something in common.

1684
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:16.526
We're werecreatures, Wolf.

1685
01:23:16.613 --> 01:23:19.352
We share the moon.

1686
01:23:19.439 --> 01:23:21.744
I guess we do.

1687
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:22.917
Hm.

1688
01:23:30.613 --> 01:23:32.091
Clawdeen, photo op.

1689
01:23:32.178 --> 01:23:33.570
Yeah, just a sec.

1690
01:23:33.657 --> 01:23:35.613
Say shelfie. Both: Shelfie.

1691
01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:37.570
Where's Draculaura?

1692
01:23:37.657 --> 01:23:40.830
Ayo, D, we got to cut that cake.

1693
01:23:40.917 --> 01:23:43.178
You know, I feel like

1694
01:23:43.265 --> 01:23:45.352
I got to see a little of
the real gorgon out there.

1695
01:23:45.439 --> 01:23:47.874
It was kind of cool.
- I got to be honest.

1696
01:23:47.961 --> 01:23:52.178
For the first time in a
while, it felt like me.

1697
01:23:52.265 --> 01:23:56.526
And I've realized something.

1698
01:23:56.613 --> 01:23:59.178
I've realized I need to leave.

1699
01:23:59.265 --> 01:24:00.613
Leave?

1700
01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:03.309
Yeah, the Gorgodian.

1701
01:24:03.396 --> 01:24:06.961
I'm going to do it and go
figure out who I really am.

1702
01:24:07.048 --> 01:24:08.657
What?

1703
01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:11.396
But that's a whole year.

1704
01:24:11.483 --> 01:24:13.613
Yeah, it is.

1705
01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:16.309
But Monster High.

1706
01:24:16.396 --> 01:24:18.265
I can't imagine it without you.

1707
01:24:18.352 --> 01:24:21.222
No, I can't imagine
Monster High without you.

1708
01:24:21.309 --> 01:24:25.048
This is who you are.
You found yourself.

1709
01:24:25.135 --> 01:24:28.743
Now it's my turn.

1710
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:32.352

01:24:32.439 --> 01:24:34.439
