1
00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:15.153
So you want me to tell
you the story of my life.

2
00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:18.781
Like I said, that's what I do.
I interview people.

3
00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:20.533
I'm a collector of lives.

4
00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.535
FM radio, KFRC.

5
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.329
You'll need a lot of tape
for my story.

6
00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:28.875
No problem.
I got a bag full of tape.

7
00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.170
You followed me here,
didn't you?

8
00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.714
Yeah, I suppose I did.

9
00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.592
You seemed very interesting.

10
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.178
This is where you live?

11
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:41.387
No.

12
00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:43.931
It's just a room.

13
00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.978
What do you say
we get started?

14
00:03:51.355 --> 00:03:52.982
What do you do?

15
00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:55.526
I'm a vampire.

16
00:03:57.528 --> 00:04:00.364
I haven't heard that before.

17
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.992
You mean this literally,
I take it?

18
00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:05.328
Absolutely.

19
00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:08.039
I was waiting for you
in that alley.

20
00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:11.167
Watching you watching me.

21
00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:14.128
And then you began to speak.

22
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.714
What a lucky break for me.

23
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.592
Perhaps lucky for both of us.

24
00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.264
You said you were...

25
00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.433
...waiting for me.

26
00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:30.978
What were you going to do?
Kill me, drink my blood?

27
00:04:31.103 --> 00:04:33.022
Yes.

28
00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:36.275
But you needn't be
concerned now.

29
00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.198
You really believe this, don't you,
that you're a vampire?

30
00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.367
We can't begin this way.

31
00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.994
Let me turn on the light.

32
00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:51.290
- I thought vampires didn't like light.
- We love it.

33
00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.086
I only wanted to prepare you.

34
00:04:56.754 --> 00:04:57.797
Christ!

35
00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:00.299
Don't be frightened.

36
00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:02.718
I want this opportunity.

37
00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:04.804
How the hell did you do that?

38
00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:07.098
The same as you do.

39
00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.767
A series of simple gestures.

40
00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:13.145
Only I moved too fast
for you to see.

41
00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.523
I'm flesh and blood...

42
00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.692
...but not human.

43
00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:21.821
I haven't been human
for 200 years.

44
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.032
Please...

45
00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.543
How can I put you at ease?

46
00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:38.379
Shall we begin like
"David Copperfield"?

47
00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:39.714
"I am born..."

48
00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.966
"...I grew up."

49
00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:48.306
Or shall we begin when I was
born to darkness, as I call it.

50
00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:52.810
That's where we should start,
don't you think?

51
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.106
You're not lying, are you?

52
00:05:57.481 --> 00:05:59.984
Why should I lie?

53
00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.530
1791 was the year it happened.

54
00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.911
I was 24.

55
00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.622
Younger than you are now.

56
00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:17.209
But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.

57
00:06:17.334 --> 00:06:22.256
The master of a large plantation,
just south of New Orleans.

58
00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:27.636
I had lost my wife
in childbirth.

59
00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:31.849
She and the infant had been
buried less than half a year.

60
00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:35.352
I would've been happy
to join them.

61
00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:40.066
I couldn't bear the pain
of their loss.

62
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:43.444
I longed to be released from it.

63
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.167
I wanted to lose it all:

64
00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:00.419
my wealth...

65
00:07:00.544 --> 00:07:02.505
...my estate...

66
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.049
...my sanity.

67
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.226
How many aces are in a deck?

68
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:18.020
Are you calling me a cheat?

69
00:07:20.397 --> 00:07:24.151
No, I'm calling you
a piece of stinking offal!

70
00:07:29.323 --> 00:07:32.868
You lack the courage
of your convictions. Do it!

71
00:07:32.993 --> 00:07:36.163
Most of all,
I longed for death.

72
00:07:36.288 --> 00:07:38.499
I know that now.

73
00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:41.126
I invited it.

74
00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:44.755
A release
from the pain of living.

75
00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:09.655
My invitation
was open to anyone.

76
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.783
To the whore at my side.

77
00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:16.078
To the pimp that followed.

78
00:08:17.621 --> 00:08:21.458
But it was a vampire
that accepted.

79
00:08:48.235 --> 00:08:51.071
Give me your money
or you die!

80
00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:28.567
Do you still want death?

81
00:09:28.692 --> 00:09:30.903
Or have you
tasted it enough?

82
00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:33.030
Enough.

83
00:09:42.247 --> 00:09:46.251
He left me there, on the banks
of the Mississippi...

84
00:09:46.668 --> 00:09:50.589
...somewhere between
life and death.

85
00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:12.611
Who are you?
What're you doing in my house?

86
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.323
I've come to answer
your prayers.

87
00:10:18.158 --> 00:10:21.411
Life has no meaning anymore...
does it?

88
00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:27.125
The wine has no taste.

89
00:10:27.251 --> 00:10:29.294
The food sickens you.

90
00:10:29.419 --> 00:10:33.257
There seems no reason for any of it...
does there?

91
00:10:37.886 --> 00:10:40.639
What if I could
give it back to you?

92
00:10:40.764 --> 00:10:42.391
Pluck out the pain...

93
00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:45.185
...and give you another life?

94
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.480
One you could never imagine.

95
00:10:48.856 --> 00:10:51.775
And it would be...
for all time.

96
00:10:53.527 --> 00:10:54.945
And sickness...

97
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.697
...and death...

98
00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:59.992
...could never touch you again.

99
00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.287
Don't be afraid.

100
00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:06.039
I'm going to give you
the choice...

101
00:11:06.164 --> 00:11:07.457
...I...

102
00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:09.918
...never had.

103
00:11:18.927 --> 00:11:21.763
That morning,
I was not yet a vampire...

104
00:11:21.888 --> 00:11:25.392
...and I saw my last sunrise.

105
00:11:25.517 --> 00:11:28.478
I remember it completely...

106
00:11:28.604 --> 00:11:32.816
...and yet I can't recall
any sunrise before it.

107
00:11:34.526 --> 00:11:38.405
I watched the whole magnificence
of the dawn for the last time...

108
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.199
...as if it were the first.

109
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.372
And then I said farewell
to sunlight...

110
00:11:47.497 --> 00:11:49.583
...and set out to become...

111
00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:51.585
...what I became.

112
00:12:12.272 --> 00:12:15.942
Have you said your good-byes
to the light?

113
00:12:38.548 --> 00:12:40.217
I've drained you...

114
00:12:40.342 --> 00:12:43.303
...to the point of death.

115
00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:45.972
If I leave you here...

116
00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:48.266
...you'll die.

117
00:12:48.683 --> 00:12:50.435
Or...

118
00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:54.773
...you can be young always,
my friend...

119
00:12:55.315 --> 00:12:57.984
...as we are now.

120
00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:01.279
But you must tell me...

121
00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:02.823
...will you come...

122
00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:04.908
...or no?

123
00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:10.288
Yes.

124
00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:17.295
Yes.

125
00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:24.738
Your body's dying.

126
00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:27.157
Pay no attention.

127
00:14:27.282 --> 00:14:29.993
It happens to us all.

128
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:01.816
Now look...

129
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:05.111
...with your vampire eyes.

130
00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:25.965
What did you see?

131
00:15:26.132 --> 00:15:29.094
No words can describe it.

132
00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:32.722
Might as well ask Heaven
what it sees.

133
00:15:32.847 --> 00:15:35.392
No human can know.

134
00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:39.396
The statue seemed to move,
but didn't.

135
00:15:39.521 --> 00:15:43.316
The world had changed,
yet stayed the same.

136
00:15:44.025 --> 00:15:48.822
I was a newborn vampire,
weeping at the beauty of the night.

137
00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:57.288
Perhaps you'd like
another cigarette?

138
00:15:57.914 --> 00:16:00.792
I would.
It's not bothering you, is it?

139
00:16:00.917 --> 00:16:05.672
I don't assume it would.
It's not like you'll die from cancer.

140
00:16:05.797 --> 00:16:08.258
I don't think so.

141
00:16:09.426 --> 00:16:12.095
- What about crucifixes?
- Crucifixes?

142
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.305
Can you look at them?

143
00:16:14.431 --> 00:16:18.184
Actually, I'm quite fond of
looking at crucifixes.

144
00:16:18.435 --> 00:16:20.603
And the stake
through the heart?

145
00:16:20.728 --> 00:16:21.980
Nonsense.

146
00:16:22.105 --> 00:16:24.149
And coffins?

147
00:16:24.357 --> 00:16:25.817
Coffins.

148
00:16:25.942 --> 00:16:29.487
Coffins, unfortunately,
are a necessity.

149
00:16:31.489 --> 00:16:33.700
Don't worry.

150
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.577
Soon...

151
00:16:35.702 --> 00:16:39.998
...you'll be sleeping as
soundly as you've ever slept.

152
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.751
And when you awake...

153
00:16:44.043 --> 00:16:46.838
...I'll be waiting for you...

154
00:16:46.963 --> 00:16:50.341
...and so will all the world.

155
00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:02.812
Blood, I was to find,
was a necessity as well.

156
00:17:03.146 --> 00:17:07.859
I awoke the next evening with
a hunger I had never felt.

157
00:17:08.943 --> 00:17:11.196
Once you taste this...

158
00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:15.033
...you'll never go to
another tavern again.

159
00:17:15.158 --> 00:17:17.660
You think so?

160
00:17:17.952 --> 00:17:21.497
But what if I'd rather
taste your lips?

161
00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:25.084
My lips are even sweeter still.

162
00:17:40.433 --> 00:17:42.727
My friend...

163
00:17:42.852 --> 00:17:45.521
...should taste those lips.

164
00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:46.898
Is his...

165
00:17:47.023 --> 00:17:48.316
...kiss...

166
00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:49.651
...as deep...

167
00:17:49.776 --> 00:17:52.111
...as yours?

168
00:17:52.612 --> 00:17:55.281
Deeper, ma chérie.

169
00:18:29.273 --> 00:18:32.276
I will not take her life.

170
00:18:32.735 --> 00:18:35.279
I've done it for you.

171
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.826
She's dead...

172
00:18:40.076 --> 00:18:43.246
...as a doornail, my friend.

173
00:18:50.002 --> 00:18:54.173
It's so easy, you almost feel sorry for them.

174
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.140
You'll get used to killing.

175
00:19:02.265 --> 00:19:05.560
Just forget about that mortal coil.

176
00:19:05.685 --> 00:19:09.355
You'll become accustomed to it,
all too quickly.

177
00:19:16.904 --> 00:19:18.406
Are you not hungry?

178
00:19:18.531 --> 00:19:20.324
Au contraire, ma chérie.

179
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.286
He could eat the whole colony.

180
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.473
I will finish it.

181
00:19:43.598 --> 00:19:45.683
Now leave us.

182
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:55.568
Can't you pretend, you fool?

183
00:19:55.693 --> 00:19:57.987
Don't give the game away.

184
00:19:58.112 --> 00:20:01.282
We're lucky to have such a home.

185
00:20:10.708 --> 00:20:14.045
Pretend to drink, at least.

186
00:20:18.382 --> 00:20:21.886
Such fine crystal
shouldn't go to waste.

187
00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:44.700
I know.

188
00:20:44.825 --> 00:20:47.119
It gets cold so quickly.

189
00:20:47.245 --> 00:20:48.871
We can live like this?

190
00:20:48.996 --> 00:20:50.623
On animal blood?

191
00:20:50.748 --> 00:20:54.460
I wouldn't call it living.
Call it surviving.

192
00:20:54.585 --> 00:20:58.172
Useful trick if you're
on a ship for a month.

193
00:21:00.216 --> 00:21:03.302
There's nothing in the world
now that doesn't hold some...

194
00:21:03.427 --> 00:21:05.596
Fascination.

195
00:21:05.972 --> 00:21:07.890
Yes.

196
00:21:08.516 --> 00:21:11.560
- I'm bored with this prattle.
- We can live without killing.

197
00:21:11.686 --> 00:21:13.145
It's possible.

198
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.814
Anything is possible.

199
00:21:14.939 --> 00:21:17.316
But just try it for a week.

200
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:22.780
Come into New Orleans and let
me show you some real sport.

201
00:21:32.748 --> 00:21:36.919
Lestat killed two,
sometimes three a night.

202
00:21:37.086 --> 00:21:38.963
A fresh young girl...

203
00:21:39.088 --> 00:21:42.717
...was his favorite for
the first of the evening.

204
00:21:42.842 --> 00:21:47.179
For seconds, he preferred a gilded,
beautiful youth.

205
00:21:48.139 --> 00:21:52.268
But the snob in him
loved to hunt in society.

206
00:21:52.393 --> 00:21:56.397
The blood of the aristocrat
thrilled him best of all.

207
00:21:56.856 --> 00:21:59.859
The trick is
not to think about it.

208
00:21:59.984 --> 00:22:01.402
You see that one?

209
00:22:01.527 --> 00:22:03.237
Widow St. Clair.

210
00:22:03.362 --> 00:22:07.950
She had that gorgeous young fop
murder her husband.

211
00:22:08.075 --> 00:22:10.286
How do you know?

212
00:22:10.953 --> 00:22:13.372
Read her thoughts.

213
00:22:14.957 --> 00:22:17.543
Read her thoughts.

214
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.009
I can't.

215
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:29.096
The "dark gift"
is different for each of us.

216
00:22:29.221 --> 00:22:34.226
But one thing is true of everyone.
We grow stronger as we go along.

217
00:22:34.518 --> 00:22:37.354
Just take my word for it.

218
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.483
She blamed a slave
for his murder.

219
00:22:40.608 --> 00:22:43.444
Imagine what they did to him.

220
00:22:43.569 --> 00:22:47.490
Evil-doers are easier,
and they taste better.

221
00:23:20.189 --> 00:23:22.525
Where are we going?

222
00:23:29.657 --> 00:23:31.659
Nowhere.

223
00:23:31.992 --> 00:23:35.996
Now, young man,
you really amaze me!

224
00:23:38.165 --> 00:23:42.253
I'm old enough
to be your grandmother.

225
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.270
Oh, yes, that's the melody.

226
00:23:59.395 --> 00:24:01.897
I remember it.

227
00:24:13.659 --> 00:24:15.703
Murderer!

228
00:24:15.828 --> 00:24:17.204
My little papillons!

229
00:24:17.329 --> 00:24:20.666
My butterflies, he killed them!

230
00:24:23.043 --> 00:24:25.462
You...
whining coward of a vampire...

231
00:24:25.587 --> 00:24:30.050
...who prowls killing rats and poodles!
You could've finished us!

232
00:24:30.175 --> 00:24:31.635
You've condemned me to Hell!

233
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.221
I don't know any Hell.

234
00:24:38.642 --> 00:24:40.686
That's more like it!

235
00:24:40.811 --> 00:24:42.229
Anger! Fury!

236
00:24:42.354 --> 00:24:45.774
That's why I chose you!

237
00:24:50.446 --> 00:24:53.866
But you can't kill me, Louis.

238
00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:02.082
Feed...

239
00:25:02.207 --> 00:25:04.418
...on what you will.

240
00:25:04.543 --> 00:25:06.503
Rats, chickens...

241
00:25:06.628 --> 00:25:08.630
...poodles.

242
00:25:09.089 --> 00:25:11.050
I'll leave you to it...

243
00:25:11.175 --> 00:25:13.552
...and watch you come around.

244
00:25:13.677 --> 00:25:15.137
Remember:

245
00:25:15.262 --> 00:25:17.473
Life without me...

246
00:25:17.598 --> 00:25:19.391
...would be even more...

247
00:25:19.516 --> 00:25:21.685
...unbearable.

248
00:26:22.496 --> 00:26:25.332
Consider yourself lucky.

249
00:26:25.707 --> 00:26:29.711
In Paris, a vampire must be
clever for many reasons.

250
00:26:30.045 --> 00:26:31.338
Paris?

251
00:26:31.463 --> 00:26:35.133
Here all one needs
is a pair of fangs.

252
00:26:35.342 --> 00:26:37.219
You came from Paris?

253
00:26:37.344 --> 00:26:40.514
As did the one who made me.

254
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.811
Tell me about him.
You must've learned something from him.

255
00:26:47.437 --> 00:26:50.607
I learned absolutely nothing.

256
00:26:51.024 --> 00:26:54.361
I wasn't given a choice, remember?

257
00:26:54.486 --> 00:26:57.155
You must know something
about the meaning of it all.

258
00:26:57.281 --> 00:27:00.200
Why? Why should I know
these things?

259
00:27:00.325 --> 00:27:01.952
Do you know them?

260
00:27:02.077 --> 00:27:03.328
That noise...

261
00:27:03.453 --> 00:27:05.664
...it's driving me mad!

262
00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:09.251
We've been here for weeks
with nothing but that noise!

263
00:27:09.376 --> 00:27:11.086
They know about us.

264
00:27:11.211 --> 00:27:15.924
They watch us dine on empty plates
and drink from empty glasses.

265
00:27:16.049 --> 00:27:17.342
Come...

266
00:27:17.467 --> 00:27:19.594
...to New Orleans then.

267
00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.515
The Paris Opera's in town.
We can try some French...

268
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.600
...cuisine.

269
00:27:25.726 --> 00:27:29.730
Forgive me if I have a
lingering respect for life.

270
00:27:31.815 --> 00:27:35.068
You'll soon run out
of chickens, Louis.

271
00:28:08.935 --> 00:28:10.812
Monsieur Louis?

272
00:28:10.937 --> 00:28:13.607
You don't want any supper?

273
00:28:14.691 --> 00:28:16.777
No, ma chérie.

274
00:28:17.027 --> 00:28:20.030
We're worried about you, Master.

275
00:28:21.573 --> 00:28:24.993
When is it that you go
riding in the field?

276
00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.539
And how long since you've
been to the slave quarter?

277
00:28:31.917 --> 00:28:34.753
Everywhere there is death.

278
00:28:36.713 --> 00:28:39.257
Are you still our master at all?

279
00:28:39.382 --> 00:28:42.135
That will be all, Yvette.

280
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.680
I will not go
unless you listen to me.

281
00:28:46.807 --> 00:28:50.227
You must send away
this friend of yours.

282
00:28:50.602 --> 00:28:54.022
The slaves are all
frightened of him...

283
00:28:54.981 --> 00:28:57.984
...and they are
frightened of you.

284
00:29:02.864 --> 00:29:05.867
I'm frightened of myself.

285
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.627
Hear me now!

286
00:29:57.752 --> 00:29:59.921
This place is cursed!

287
00:30:00.046 --> 00:30:01.631
Damned!

288
00:30:01.756 --> 00:30:05.176
And, yes,
your master is the Devil!

289
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.597
Get out while you can!
You're all free!

290
00:30:08.722 --> 00:30:10.974
Do you hear me?

291
00:30:11.349 --> 00:30:12.517
Run!

292
00:30:12.642 --> 00:30:13.560
Run!

293
00:30:13.685 --> 00:30:16.605
Save yourselves!

294
00:31:06.488 --> 00:31:08.531
Perfect! Perfect!

295
00:31:08.656 --> 00:31:12.327
Just burn the place!
Burn everything we own!

296
00:31:12.452 --> 00:31:15.121
Have us living in a field,
like cattle!

297
00:31:15.246 --> 00:31:17.499
You thought
you could have it all.

298
00:31:17.624 --> 00:31:19.959
Shut up, Louis!

299
00:31:20.585 --> 00:31:22.670
Come on!

300
00:31:43.858 --> 00:31:46.194
Where are we?

301
00:31:46.319 --> 00:31:49.155
Where do you think,
my idiot friend?

302
00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.617
We're in a nice,
filthy cemetery.

303
00:31:52.742 --> 00:31:54.369
Are you happy?

304
00:31:54.494 --> 00:31:57.664
Is this fitting?
Proper enough?

305
00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:59.707
We belong in Hell.

306
00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:01.668
What if there is no Hell?

307
00:32:01.793 --> 00:32:05.755
Or they don't want us there?
Ever think of that?

308
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.717
But there was a Hell.

309
00:32:09.843 --> 00:32:13.638
And no matter where we moved to,
I was in it.

310
00:32:14.514 --> 00:32:18.518
We rented rooms on the
waterfront of New Orleans.

311
00:32:19.352 --> 00:32:22.272
Your skin is icy.

312
00:32:43.334 --> 00:32:46.379
Your friend has
no head for wine.

313
00:32:50.008 --> 00:32:52.093
Don't worry.

314
00:32:52.218 --> 00:32:56.264
I can warm that cold skin
of yours better than she can.

315
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:58.600
Do you think so?

316
00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.768
Why...

317
00:33:00.894 --> 00:33:03.396
...you're warm now!

318
00:33:03.896 --> 00:33:06.232
But the price is high.

319
00:33:06.357 --> 00:33:09.694
Your pretty friend,
I exhausted her.

320
00:33:12.905 --> 00:33:15.033
Soft.

321
00:33:16.242 --> 00:33:18.745
So soft.

322
00:33:19.746 --> 00:33:23.541
I can see you lying
on a bed of satin.

323
00:33:23.875 --> 00:33:26.878
Such things you say.

324
00:33:27.712 --> 00:33:30.673
Do you know
what manner of bed?

325
00:33:57.992 --> 00:34:00.828
Should we put out the light?

326
00:34:05.917 --> 00:34:09.003
And then put out the light.

327
00:34:23.518 --> 00:34:26.479
But once I've put out
thy light...

328
00:34:27.563 --> 00:34:29.649
...I cannot...

329
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:33.528
...give it vital breath again.

330
00:34:34.695 --> 00:34:37.532
Its needs must wither.

331
00:34:49.502 --> 00:34:51.129
For you, Louis.

332
00:34:51.254 --> 00:34:53.923
You can pretend it's wine.

333
00:35:03.724 --> 00:35:04.976
She's not dead!

334
00:35:05.101 --> 00:35:09.188
You're in love with your mortal nature.
You resist what can bring you peace.

335
00:35:09.313 --> 00:35:10.731
You call this peace?

336
00:35:10.857 --> 00:35:14.944
We're predators, whose all-seeing
eyes give them detachment!

337
00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:17.738
- The girl, Lestat!
- Take her! End that hunger!

338
00:35:17.864 --> 00:35:19.699
No!

339
00:35:25.997 --> 00:35:28.374
Now, my child.

340
00:35:29.625 --> 00:35:32.837
You're tired,
you want to sleep!

341
00:35:42.054 --> 00:35:43.764
It's a coffin!

342
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.392
A coffin! Let me out!

343
00:35:46.517 --> 00:35:48.102
I'm not dead!

344
00:35:48.227 --> 00:35:53.065
It's your coffin, enjoy it. Most of us
never get to know what it feels like.

345
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:54.692
Why do you do this?

346
00:35:54.817 --> 00:35:59.822
I like to do it. I enjoy it.
Take your aesthete's taste to purer things.

347
00:35:59.947 --> 00:36:02.950
Kill them swiftly if you will,
but do it!

348
00:36:03.075 --> 00:36:06.662
For do not doubt
you are a killer, Louis!

349
00:36:13.461 --> 00:36:16.964
- What's that?
- It's a coffin.

350
00:36:17.298 --> 00:36:20.176
So it is. You must be dead.

351
00:36:21.093 --> 00:36:23.137
I'm not dead, am I?

352
00:36:23.262 --> 00:36:24.639
You're not dead.

353
00:36:24.764 --> 00:36:26.098
Not yet.

354
00:36:26.223 --> 00:36:28.017
Finish this now!

355
00:36:28.142 --> 00:36:29.310
You finish it!

356
00:36:29.435 --> 00:36:31.395
Save me from him!

357
00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.356
Save me!

358
00:36:34.857 --> 00:36:36.692
You'll let me go?

359
00:36:36.817 --> 00:36:39.320
I can't die like this!

360
00:36:39.445 --> 00:36:40.696
I need a priest.

361
00:36:40.821 --> 00:36:43.783
My friend is a priest.
He'll hear your sins before you die.

362
00:36:43.908 --> 00:36:46.118
Unless...
I make her one of us.

363
00:36:46.243 --> 00:36:47.286
No!

364
00:36:47.411 --> 00:36:52.124
Then take her, Louis,
end her suffering!
End yours!

365
00:36:52.625 --> 00:36:54.460
No!

366
00:37:13.688 --> 00:37:15.314
Now...

367
00:37:15.439 --> 00:37:17.942
...are you happy?

368
00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.531
My God!

369
00:37:24.782 --> 00:37:26.575
To think you...

370
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.870
...are all I have to learn from.

371
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:35.668
In the Old World...

372
00:37:35.793 --> 00:37:39.296
...they called it the
"dark gift."

373
00:37:41.382 --> 00:37:44.385
And I gave it to you.

374
00:38:06.532 --> 00:38:09.910
Don't go that way, Monsieur.
It's the plague.

375
00:38:10.035 --> 00:38:14.081
- Go back the way you came!
- The way I came...

376
00:38:29.597 --> 00:38:31.348
Mama.

377
00:38:55.664 --> 00:38:57.917
Please help us.

378
00:38:58.042 --> 00:39:01.253
Papa left us
and didn't come back.

379
00:39:08.719 --> 00:39:12.181
Please, wake Mama, Monsieur.

380
00:39:39.625 --> 00:39:42.294
My philosopher.
My martyr.

381
00:39:42.419 --> 00:39:45.631
"Never take a human life."

382
00:39:46.715 --> 00:39:49.802
This calls for a celebration.

383
00:39:59.144 --> 00:40:02.773
There's still life
in the old lady yet.

384
00:40:05.609 --> 00:40:07.152
Come back!

385
00:40:07.277 --> 00:40:10.280
You are what you are!

386
00:40:11.615 --> 00:40:14.451
Merciful death.

387
00:40:14.576 --> 00:40:18.122
How you love
your precious guilt.

388
00:40:27.339 --> 00:40:29.466
Her blood coursed in my veins...

389
00:40:29.591 --> 00:40:31.593
...sweeter than life itself.

390
00:40:31.719 --> 00:40:34.304
And, as it did, Lestat's words
made sense to me.

391
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.390
I knew peace
only when I killed.

392
00:40:36.515 --> 00:40:42.062
When I heard her heart in that terrible
rhythm, I knew what peace could be.

393
00:41:16.889 --> 00:41:21.727
All I need to find you, Louis,
is follow the corpses of rats.

394
00:41:29.735 --> 00:41:32.446
Pain is terrible for you.

395
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:37.576
You feel it like no other creature,
because you're a vampire.

396
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.996
You don't want it to go on.

397
00:41:41.121 --> 00:41:43.123
No.

398
00:41:45.584 --> 00:41:49.504
Then do what it is
in your nature to do...

399
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:54.092
...and you will feel as you felt
with that child in your arms.

400
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:58.305
Evil is a point of view.

401
00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:01.433
God kills indiscriminately...

402
00:42:01.975 --> 00:42:04.645
...and so shall we.

403
00:42:04.895 --> 00:42:09.900
For no creatures under God are as we are.
None so like Him...

404
00:42:10.025 --> 00:42:12.236
...as ourselves.

405
00:42:13.946 --> 00:42:16.990
I have a gift for you.

406
00:42:17.699 --> 00:42:19.868
Come.

407
00:42:23.205 --> 00:42:25.040
Please.

408
00:42:38.095 --> 00:42:41.264
- She's here.
- What are you saying?

409
00:42:42.099 --> 00:42:44.059
You need...

410
00:42:44.184 --> 00:42:45.727
...company...

411
00:42:45.852 --> 00:42:48.897
...more congenial than mine.

412
00:42:53.443 --> 00:42:56.279
Remember how you wanted her?

413
00:42:56.613 --> 00:42:59.074
The taste of her?

414
00:43:00.242 --> 00:43:03.203
I thought I'd killed her.

415
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.791
Don't worry.

416
00:43:08.917 --> 00:43:11.586
Your conscience is clear.

417
00:43:24.391 --> 00:43:26.435
Claudia.

418
00:43:32.941 --> 00:43:35.235
Listen to me.

419
00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.696
You're ill, my precious.

420
00:43:37.821 --> 00:43:42.617
And I'm going to give you
what you need to get well.

421
00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.798
No.

422
00:43:56.923 --> 00:43:59.593
You want her to die then?

423
00:44:14.649 --> 00:44:17.194
That's it. Yes.

424
00:44:31.249 --> 00:44:33.251
Stop!

425
00:44:35.003 --> 00:44:36.838
Stop!

426
00:44:36.963 --> 00:44:38.965
Enough!

427
00:45:19.422 --> 00:45:21.049
I want some more.

428
00:45:21.174 --> 00:45:24.511
Of course you want more.

429
00:45:54.749 --> 00:45:57.419
Gently, chérie.

430
00:45:57.711 --> 00:46:00.547
They're so innocent.

431
00:46:01.172 --> 00:46:04.175
They must not be made
to suffer.

432
00:46:04.759 --> 00:46:06.803
Good.

433
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:09.723
Yes.

434
00:46:09.848 --> 00:46:11.433
All right, now.

435
00:46:11.558 --> 00:46:13.560
Stop.

436
00:46:15.437 --> 00:46:17.814
That's enough, chérie.

437
00:46:17.939 --> 00:46:21.317
You must stop
before the heart stops.

438
00:46:21.943 --> 00:46:23.236
I want more.

439
00:46:23.361 --> 00:46:24.863
I know.

440
00:46:24.988 --> 00:46:27.323
But it's best in the beginning...

441
00:46:27.449 --> 00:46:31.077
...lest the Death
takes you down with it.

442
00:46:31.411 --> 00:46:33.872
You've done very well.
Look at you.

443
00:46:33.997 --> 00:46:37.167
Not a drop spilt.
Very good.

444
00:46:39.252 --> 00:46:41.588
Where is Mama?

445
00:46:44.424 --> 00:46:46.593
Mama's gone...

446
00:46:46.718 --> 00:46:50.889
...to Heaven, chérie, like
that sweet lady... right there.

447
00:46:51.556 --> 00:46:53.767
They all go to Heaven.

448
00:46:53.892 --> 00:46:56.227
All but us.

449
00:46:56.644 --> 00:46:59.147
Do you want to
frighten our daughter?

450
00:46:59.272 --> 00:47:00.899
I'm not your daughter.

451
00:47:01.024 --> 00:47:03.151
Oh, yes, you are.

452
00:47:03.276 --> 00:47:05.904
You're my and
Louis' daughter now.

453
00:47:06.029 --> 00:47:09.574
You see,
Louis was going to leave us.

454
00:47:10.033 --> 00:47:12.702
He was going to go away.

455
00:47:12.952 --> 00:47:15.288
But now he's not.

456
00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.415
Now he's going to stay...

457
00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.210
...and make you happy.

458
00:47:21.878 --> 00:47:23.838
Louis.

459
00:47:29.177 --> 00:47:31.054
You fiend.

460
00:47:31.179 --> 00:47:33.848
One happy family.

461
00:47:43.441 --> 00:47:45.610
He did it to make you
stay with him?

462
00:47:45.735 --> 00:47:47.278
Perhaps.

463
00:47:47.403 --> 00:47:52.450
He knew me. He knew I would love
her more than the waking world.

464
00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.162
But there was more to it.

465
00:47:56.287 --> 00:48:00.667
He lavished affection on her,
there is no doubt about that.

466
00:48:01.167 --> 00:48:06.214
Perhaps, in the end,
he did it because he was lonely too.

467
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:08.716
- I need more light.
- She needs more light.

468
00:48:08.841 --> 00:48:11.636
- I'll go blind without another lamp.
- She'll go blind.

469
00:48:11.761 --> 00:48:14.305
Or let me fit this child
during the day.

470
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:19.060
Well, I am afraid, madame,
that my days are sacrosanct.

471
00:48:19.811 --> 00:48:22.146
A little child, she was.

472
00:48:22.272 --> 00:48:24.357
But also a fierce killer...

473
00:48:24.482 --> 00:48:30.196
...now capable of the ruthless pursuit
of blood with all a child's demanding.

474
00:48:31.281 --> 00:48:33.908
Let me kiss it better.

475
00:48:47.672 --> 00:48:49.257
Now...

476
00:48:49.382 --> 00:48:53.261
...who will we get to finish
your dress? Be practical!

477
00:48:53.386 --> 00:48:56.514
Remember, never in our home!

478
00:48:56.681 --> 00:48:59.642
She slept in my coffin
at first...

479
00:48:59.767 --> 00:49:02.854
...curling her little fingers
around my hair...

480
00:49:02.979 --> 00:49:06.566
...till the day when she
wanted her own coffin.

481
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.409
But still,
whenever she awoke...

482
00:49:16.534 --> 00:49:19.329
...she would crawl into mine.

483
00:49:30.089 --> 00:49:34.135
They died fast in those days, before,
she learned to play with them...

484
00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:38.514
...to delay the moment till
she had taken what she wanted.

485
00:49:52.195 --> 00:49:54.572
Why are you crying, child?

486
00:49:54.697 --> 00:49:56.657
Are you lost, my love?

487
00:49:56.783 --> 00:49:59.035
Mama!

488
00:49:59.494 --> 00:50:01.537
Hush, now, don't cry.

489
00:50:01.662 --> 00:50:04.165
We'll find her.

490
00:50:10.546 --> 00:50:15.134
Mind the thumb, girl. Mind the thumb.
That little digit.

491
00:50:29.315 --> 00:50:32.735
They're expensive, my dear.

492
00:50:33.402 --> 00:50:37.740
Maybe too expensive for
a young girl like you.

493
00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:54.340
Claudia!
What have we told you!

494
00:50:54.465 --> 00:50:57.051
Never in the house.

495
00:50:58.636 --> 00:51:00.972
Give me some room.

496
00:51:01.597 --> 00:51:03.474
To me, she was a child.

497
00:51:03.599 --> 00:51:06.352
But to Lestat, a pupil...

498
00:51:06.477 --> 00:51:10.439
...an infant prodigy with
a lust for killing like his own.

499
00:51:10.565 --> 00:51:14.485
Together, they finished off
whole families.

500
00:51:21.075 --> 00:51:23.035
Wonderful, wonderful.

501
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.747
Now try something
on a more somber note.

502
00:51:40.303 --> 00:51:43.472
Time can pass quickly for
mortals when they're happy.

503
00:51:43.598 --> 00:51:45.850
With us, it was the same.

504
00:51:45.975 --> 00:51:49.478
The years flew by like minutes.
The city grew.

505
00:51:49.604 --> 00:51:51.856
Sailboats gave way
to steamships...

506
00:51:51.981 --> 00:51:56.736
...disgorging an endless menu
of magnificent strangers.

507
00:51:57.028 --> 00:51:59.322
A new world had sprung up around us.

508
00:51:59.447 --> 00:52:02.617
And we were all Americans now.

509
00:52:10.416 --> 00:52:12.710
This filthy modern tide!

510
00:52:12.835 --> 00:52:17.506
What I wouldn't give for a drop
of old-fashioned Creole blood!

511
00:52:17.631 --> 00:52:20.176
Yankees are not
to your taste?

512
00:52:20.301 --> 00:52:24.638
Their Democratic flavor
doesn't suit my palate, Louis.

513
00:52:43.366 --> 00:52:46.202
Now that is pure Creole.

514
00:52:48.954 --> 00:52:52.458
Trust Claudia
to have found her.

515
00:52:54.543 --> 00:52:56.295
What?

516
00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.297
Don't you want her?

517
00:52:58.422 --> 00:53:01.050
I want to be her.

518
00:53:02.927 --> 00:53:04.136
Can I?

519
00:53:04.261 --> 00:53:06.597
Be like her one day?

520
00:53:10.351 --> 00:53:14.105
More melancholy nonsense.
You grow more like Louis daily!

521
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:16.899
Soon you'll be eating rats.

522
00:53:17.733 --> 00:53:21.487
Rats?
When did you eat rats, Louis?

523
00:53:21.695 --> 00:53:23.781
It was a long, long time ago.

524
00:53:23.906 --> 00:53:26.325
Before you were born.

525
00:53:26.909 --> 00:53:29.620
And I don't recommend them.

526
00:53:31.747 --> 00:53:37.169
Thirty years had passed, yet her body
remained that of an eternal child.

527
00:53:37.461 --> 00:53:42.216
Her eyes alone told the story of her age,
staring from under her curls...

528
00:53:42.341 --> 00:53:43.801
...with a questioning...

529
00:53:43.926 --> 00:53:47.263
...that would one day
need an answer.

530
00:53:56.856 --> 00:53:58.315
Another doll.

531
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.443
I have dozens,
you realize.

532
00:54:01.652 --> 00:54:04.655
I thought you could use one more.

533
00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:07.700
Why always on this night?

534
00:54:08.158 --> 00:54:09.785
What do you mean?

535
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:13.914
You always give me a doll on
the same night of the year.

536
00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.876
I didn't realize.

537
00:54:17.001 --> 00:54:19.628
Is this my birthday?

538
00:54:23.507 --> 00:54:25.968
You dress me like a doll.

539
00:54:26.093 --> 00:54:28.053
You make my hair like a doll.

540
00:54:28.178 --> 00:54:29.722
Why?

541
00:54:29.847 --> 00:54:33.642
Some of these, Claudia,
are so old...

542
00:54:33.767 --> 00:54:35.853
...tattered.

543
00:54:36.312 --> 00:54:40.024
- You should throw them away.
- I will, then!

544
00:54:53.162 --> 00:54:54.830
What have you done?

545
00:54:54.955 --> 00:54:57.124
What you told me to do!

546
00:54:57.249 --> 00:55:00.336
- You leave a corpse here to rot?
- I wanted her!

547
00:55:00.461 --> 00:55:02.921
- I wanted to be her!
- She's mad!

548
00:55:03.047 --> 00:55:06.550
She pollutes the very house
we live in!

549
00:55:06.884 --> 00:55:10.638
Do you want me to be
a doll forever?

550
00:55:11.138 --> 00:55:12.431
Don't!

551
00:55:12.556 --> 00:55:14.850
Why not?
Can't I change...

552
00:55:14.975 --> 00:55:17.436
...like everyone else?

553
00:55:44.046 --> 00:55:46.507
Which one of you did it?

554
00:55:46.632 --> 00:55:48.759
Which one of you did it?

555
00:55:48.884 --> 00:55:51.720
Which one of you
made me the way I am?

556
00:55:51.845 --> 00:55:53.430
What you are?

557
00:55:53.555 --> 00:55:57.142
A vampire gone insane,
that pollutes its own bed!

558
00:55:57.267 --> 00:55:59.186
And if I cut my hair again?

559
00:55:59.311 --> 00:56:01.313
It will grow back again.

560
00:56:01.438 --> 00:56:03.148
But it wasn't always so!

561
00:56:03.273 --> 00:56:06.485
I had a mother once.
And Louis, he had a wife.

562
00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:08.612
He was mortal, same as she.

563
00:56:08.737 --> 00:56:10.781
And so was I!

564
00:56:10.906 --> 00:56:12.783
You made us what we are!

565
00:56:12.908 --> 00:56:14.326
Stop her.

566
00:56:14.451 --> 00:56:16.870
Did you do it to me?

567
00:56:23.419 --> 00:56:24.962
How did you do it?

568
00:56:25.087 --> 00:56:27.923
And why should I tell you?

569
00:56:28.048 --> 00:56:30.634
It's in my power.

570
00:56:30.759 --> 00:56:32.636
Why yours alone?

571
00:56:32.761 --> 00:56:34.805
Tell me how it was done!

572
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:36.265
Be glad...

573
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:39.309
...I made you what you are.

574
00:56:40.018 --> 00:56:42.104
You'd be dead now
if I hadn't.

575
00:56:42.229 --> 00:56:45.482
Like that damned corpse!
Now get rid of it!

576
00:56:45.607 --> 00:56:48.277
You get rid of it.

577
00:56:59.204 --> 00:57:00.873
Louis, why?

578
00:57:00.998 --> 00:57:03.834
You've got to tell me.

579
00:57:09.798 --> 00:57:12.384
You see the old woman?

580
00:57:12.759 --> 00:57:15.596
That will never happen to you.

581
00:57:15.888 --> 00:57:18.348
You will never grow old.

582
00:57:18.473 --> 00:57:21.059
And you will never die.

583
00:57:21.977 --> 00:57:26.398
And it means something else too,
doesn't it?

584
00:57:29.443 --> 00:57:32.696
I shall never, ever grow up.

585
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.453
I hate him.

586
00:57:41.121 --> 00:57:45.417
Tell me how it came to be
that I am this...

587
00:57:45.542 --> 00:57:47.586
...thing.

588
00:57:53.091 --> 00:57:56.929
For thirty years
I'd avoided that place.

589
00:57:57.804 --> 00:58:00.474
Yet I found my way
back there...

590
00:58:00.599 --> 00:58:04.227
...with hardly
an upward glance.

591
00:58:19.826 --> 00:58:21.161
You...

592
00:58:21.286 --> 00:58:23.330
...fed on me?

593
00:58:23.455 --> 00:58:25.457
Yes.

594
00:58:26.583 --> 00:58:29.336
And he found me with you.

595
00:58:31.171 --> 00:58:34.549
Then he cut his wrist
and fed you from him...

596
00:58:34.675 --> 00:58:37.010
...and you were a vampire then...

597
00:58:37.135 --> 00:58:40.472
...and have been
every night thereafter.

598
00:58:43.225 --> 00:58:45.644
You both did it.

599
00:58:45.769 --> 00:58:48.313
I took your life.

600
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:52.943
He gave you another one.

601
00:58:53.985 --> 00:58:55.946
And here it is.

602
00:58:56.071 --> 00:58:58.657
I hate you both.

603
00:59:11.044 --> 00:59:13.713
I walked all night.

604
00:59:14.256 --> 00:59:16.758
I walked as I walked
years before...

605
00:59:16.883 --> 00:59:21.054
...when my mind swam with guilt
at the thought of killing.

606
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:26.768
I thought of all the things
I'd done and couldn't undo.

607
00:59:27.227 --> 00:59:30.480
And I longed for
one second's peace.

608
00:59:39.573 --> 00:59:42.742
Locked together in hatred.

609
00:59:46.955 --> 00:59:49.958
But I can't hate you, Louis.

610
00:59:55.922 --> 00:59:58.675
Louis, my love.

611
00:59:59.885 --> 01:00:02.762
I was mortal till you...

612
01:00:03.555 --> 01:00:06.766
...gave me your immortal kiss.

613
01:00:07.767 --> 01:00:11.771
You became my mother
and my father.

614
01:00:12.731 --> 01:00:15.901
And so I'm yours forever.

615
01:00:17.402 --> 01:00:20.822
But now it's time
to end it, Louis.

616
01:00:21.656 --> 01:00:24.826
Now it's time to leave him.

617
01:00:28.079 --> 01:00:30.957
He will never let us go.

618
01:00:42.552 --> 01:00:44.554
Really?

619
01:00:56.232 --> 01:00:59.402
What is it now? You irritate me.
Your very presence...

620
01:00:59.527 --> 01:01:00.695
...irritates me!

621
01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:02.405
Does it?

622
01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:06.034
I found someone who'll be a
vampire better than you both!

623
01:01:06.159 --> 01:01:08.954
Is that supposed to
frighten me?

624
01:01:09.079 --> 01:01:13.041
You're spoiled,
because you're an only child.

625
01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:15.460
You need a brother.

626
01:01:15.585 --> 01:01:17.504
Or I do.

627
01:01:17.629 --> 01:01:20.131
I'm weary of you both.

628
01:01:20.256 --> 01:01:23.301
I suppose we could people
the world with vampires...

629
01:01:23.426 --> 01:01:25.887
...the three of us.

630
01:01:26.012 --> 01:01:27.639
Oh, not you...

631
01:01:27.764 --> 01:01:30.058
...my little Claudia.

632
01:01:30.183 --> 01:01:32.560
You're a liar.

633
01:01:32.769 --> 01:01:35.647
But you upset my plans.

634
01:01:36.064 --> 01:01:38.775
What plans?

635
01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:41.403
I came to make peace
with you.

636
01:01:41.528 --> 01:01:44.864
Even though you're
the father of lies...

637
01:01:44.989 --> 01:01:48.243
...I want things to be
as they were.

638
01:01:48.743 --> 01:01:51.329
Stop pestering me then.

639
01:01:54.332 --> 01:01:57.419
I must do more than that.

640
01:01:57.711 --> 01:02:00.588
I've brought
a present for you.

641
01:02:02.382 --> 01:02:04.008
Then I hope it's...

642
01:02:04.134 --> 01:02:06.261
...a beautiful woman...

643
01:02:06.386 --> 01:02:10.306
...with endowments
you'll never possess.

644
01:02:13.184 --> 01:02:15.937
Why do you say such things?

645
01:02:24.487 --> 01:02:27.157
You haven't fed enough.

646
01:02:27.282 --> 01:02:30.034
I can tell by your color.

647
01:02:36.082 --> 01:02:38.418
Come and see.

648
01:02:55.059 --> 01:02:57.103
Don't be angry with me.

649
01:02:57.228 --> 01:03:00.732
When I saw them,
I knew they were for you.

650
01:03:01.524 --> 01:03:03.485
Drunk...

651
01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:07.030
...on brandywine.
A thimbleful.

652
01:03:15.497 --> 01:03:17.332
You certainly have...

653
01:03:17.457 --> 01:03:19.792
...outdone yourself.

654
01:03:20.919 --> 01:03:24.339
I promise
I'll get rid of the bodies.

655
01:03:37.936 --> 01:03:40.647
We forgive each other then?

656
01:03:41.481 --> 01:03:43.524
Yes.

657
01:03:58.915 --> 01:04:01.042
Absinthe?

658
01:04:03.086 --> 01:04:05.338
You've given them absinthe?

659
01:04:05.463 --> 01:04:06.798
No.

660
01:04:06.923 --> 01:04:08.883
Laudanum.

661
01:04:09.634 --> 01:04:10.885
Laudanum.

662
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:12.512
Yes.

663
01:04:12.637 --> 01:04:15.473
It killed them, unfortunately.

664
01:04:15.598 --> 01:04:18.518
But it keeps the blood warm.

665
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:24.565
You let me drink...

666
01:04:25.817 --> 01:04:27.944
...dead blood?

667
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:29.946
You let me...

668
01:04:30.071 --> 01:04:32.115
...drink...

669
01:04:32.407 --> 01:04:34.701
One lesson you taught me...

670
01:04:34.826 --> 01:04:37.620
...never drink from the dead.

671
01:04:39.914 --> 01:04:42.083
Put me in my coffin.

672
01:04:42.208 --> 01:04:43.751
Put me in my coffin.

673
01:04:43.876 --> 01:04:46.629
I'll put you in your coffin!

674
01:04:51.175 --> 01:04:53.011
My God!

675
01:05:10.486 --> 01:05:12.822
Lift me up!

676
01:05:27.462 --> 01:05:30.131
Good night, sweet prince.

677
01:05:31.215 --> 01:05:35.720
May flights of devils wing
you to your rest.

678
01:05:36.804 --> 01:05:38.639
Should we burn him?

679
01:05:38.765 --> 01:05:40.224
Bury him?

680
01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:43.019
What would he have liked?

681
01:05:46.439 --> 01:05:48.441
The swamp?

682
01:06:12.089 --> 01:06:14.926
He belongs with those reptiles.

683
01:06:16.594 --> 01:06:19.430
He deserved to die.

684
01:06:19.805 --> 01:06:23.559
Then perhaps so do we,
every night of our lives.

685
01:06:26.437 --> 01:06:29.106
He was my maker.

686
01:06:29.398 --> 01:06:31.192
He gave me this life...

687
01:06:31.317 --> 01:06:33.736
...whatever it is.

688
01:06:36.155 --> 01:06:38.658
It shouldn't have been
this way.

689
01:06:38.783 --> 01:06:40.993
I did it for us.

690
01:06:41.827 --> 01:06:44.580
So we could be free.

691
01:06:50.419 --> 01:06:52.588
You missed him?

692
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:55.258
He was all I knew.

693
01:06:55.383 --> 01:06:57.927
It's as simple as that.

694
01:06:58.261 --> 01:07:01.931
We were like two orphans
learning to live again.

695
01:07:03.557 --> 01:07:06.394
We booked a passage
to Europe.

696
01:07:06.602 --> 01:07:09.355
Over the weeks,
while waiting for the boat...

697
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:13.276
...she studied the myths
and legends of the Old World...

698
01:07:13.401 --> 01:07:17.571
...obsessed with the search
of what she called "our kind."

699
01:07:32.003 --> 01:07:34.588
Look who we forgot.

700
01:07:38.426 --> 01:07:40.970
Let's set them free.

701
01:07:41.554 --> 01:07:43.597
- Yes.
- Yes.

702
01:07:48.436 --> 01:07:50.938
It's the carriage.

703
01:08:38.736 --> 01:08:41.280
Listen, Louis...

704
01:08:42.364 --> 01:08:44.074
...there's life...

705
01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.203
...in these old hands still.

706
01:08:49.413 --> 01:08:52.500
Not quite furioso.

707
01:08:54.668 --> 01:08:56.837
Moderato...

708
01:08:57.338 --> 01:08:59.465
...cantabile, perhaps.

709
01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:01.550
How could it be?

710
01:09:01.675 --> 01:09:04.261
Ask the alligator.

711
01:09:04.386 --> 01:09:07.056
His blood helped.

712
01:09:08.724 --> 01:09:13.312
Then, on a diet of
the blood of snakes...

713
01:09:13.437 --> 01:09:15.439
...toads...

714
01:09:16.899 --> 01:09:19.568
...and all the putrid life...

715
01:09:19.693 --> 01:09:22.279
...of the Mississippi...

716
01:09:22.905 --> 01:09:25.115
...slowly...

717
01:09:25.616 --> 01:09:28.285
...Lestat became something...

718
01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:31.080
...like himself again.

719
01:09:35.459 --> 01:09:37.503
You've been...

720
01:09:37.628 --> 01:09:39.588
...a very...

721
01:09:39.713 --> 01:09:41.048
...very...

722
01:09:41.173 --> 01:09:43.717
...naughty little girl.

723
01:10:47.906 --> 01:10:50.909
The ship is sailing without us!

724
01:11:10.596 --> 01:11:13.349
Though the fire
seemed to spread...

725
01:11:13.474 --> 01:11:17.603
...I stood on that deck,
fearful, he would come out again...

726
01:11:17.728 --> 01:11:21.565
...from the river like some monster,
to destroy us.

727
01:11:22.066 --> 01:11:24.651
And all the while I thought...

728
01:11:24.777 --> 01:11:26.028
"Lestat..."

729
01:11:26.153 --> 01:11:29.073
"...we deserve your vengeance."

730
01:11:29.281 --> 01:11:31.867
"You gave me the 'dark gift'..."

731
01:11:31.992 --> 01:11:37.039
"...and I delivered you into the
hands of Death for the second time."

732
01:11:54.056 --> 01:11:57.768
Though the ship was
blessedly free of rats...

733
01:11:57.893 --> 01:12:02.564
...a strange plague nonetheless
struck its passengers.

734
01:12:03.357 --> 01:12:06.693
Claudia and I alone
seemed immune.

735
01:12:07.611 --> 01:12:09.822
We kept to ourselves...

736
01:12:09.947 --> 01:12:13.367
...pondering the mystery
of each other.

737
01:12:15.536 --> 01:12:17.329
We reached the Mediterranean.

738
01:12:17.454 --> 01:12:21.834
I wanted those waters to be blue...
but they were black...

739
01:12:21.959 --> 01:12:23.585
...night-time waters.

740
01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:26.088
And how I suffered then...

741
01:12:26.213 --> 01:12:30.968
...straining to recall the color
that in my youth I took for granted.

742
01:12:36.932 --> 01:12:39.309
We searched
village after village...

743
01:12:39.434 --> 01:12:40.978
...ruin after ruin...

744
01:12:41.103 --> 01:12:43.230
...country after country.

745
01:12:43.355 --> 01:12:46.275
And always we found nothing.

746
01:12:48.068 --> 01:12:52.406
I began to believe
we were the only ones.

747
01:12:53.198 --> 01:12:56.368
There was a strange
comfort in that thought.

748
01:12:56.493 --> 01:13:01.081
For what could the damned really
have to say to the damned?

749
01:13:02.332 --> 01:13:03.750
You found nothing?

750
01:13:03.875 --> 01:13:05.752
Peasant rumors...

751
01:13:05.877 --> 01:13:08.130
...superstitions about garlic...

752
01:13:08.255 --> 01:13:09.590
...crosses...

753
01:13:09.715 --> 01:13:12.718
...the old stake in the heart.

754
01:13:13.093 --> 01:13:15.178
But one of our kind?

755
01:13:15.304 --> 01:13:17.472
Not a whisper.

756
01:13:18.599 --> 01:13:22.978
There are no vampires in Transylvania?
No Count Dracula?

757
01:13:23.103 --> 01:13:24.813
Fictions, my friend.

758
01:13:24.938 --> 01:13:28.150
The vulgar fictions
of a demented Irishman.

759
01:13:29.026 --> 01:13:30.110
Paris...

760
01:13:30.235 --> 01:13:32.738
...September, 1870.

761
01:13:33.113 --> 01:13:35.866
The city I'd always
dreamed of.

762
01:13:35.991 --> 01:13:40.912
I was Creole, after all,
and Paris was the mother of New Orleans.

763
01:13:41.038 --> 01:13:45.292
A universe whole
and entire unto herself.

764
01:14:20.952 --> 01:14:23.080
We were alive again.

765
01:14:23.205 --> 01:14:24.998
Just the two of us.

766
01:14:25.123 --> 01:14:30.295
And so euphoric was I
that I yielded to her every desire.

767
01:14:42.808 --> 01:14:44.392
So it was...

768
01:14:44.518 --> 01:14:47.729
...when I'd given up the
search for vampires...

769
01:14:47.854 --> 01:14:51.024
...that a vampire found me.

770
01:16:23.783 --> 01:16:26.036
Buffoon!

771
01:16:26.912 --> 01:16:28.997
Santiago!

772
01:16:36.379 --> 01:16:41.801
I've searched the world for an
immortal and this is what I find!

773
01:16:57.942 --> 01:17:01.196
Bring the petite
beauty with you.

774
01:17:01.863 --> 01:17:03.490
No one will harm you.

775
01:17:03.615 --> 01:17:05.867
I won't allow it.

776
01:17:07.952 --> 01:17:09.496
And...

777
01:17:09.621 --> 01:17:12.207
...remember my name:

778
01:17:13.458 --> 01:17:15.543
Armand.

779
01:17:23.176 --> 01:17:25.136
Remember what I told you.

780
01:17:25.261 --> 01:17:30.016
They have different powers.
They'll read your thoughts.

781
01:17:42.654 --> 01:17:45.657
He's the one,
that's the vampire.

782
01:17:46.574 --> 01:17:48.201
Two lovers...

783
01:17:48.326 --> 01:17:52.247
...wandering down
their violet way...

784
01:17:52.414 --> 01:17:55.959
...whose passionate embraces,
each to each...

785
01:17:56.084 --> 01:18:00.338
...permit no meditations
on decay...

786
01:18:01.798 --> 01:18:03.758
...until they find themselves...

787
01:18:03.883 --> 01:18:06.302
...within my reach!

788
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:16.187
Vampires who pretend to be humans
pretending to be vampires.

789
01:18:16.312 --> 01:18:18.022
How avant-garde.

790
01:18:18.148 --> 01:18:22.402
The monk whose soul with
Heaven doth commune...

791
01:18:22.694 --> 01:18:24.362
...and spends his days...

792
01:18:24.487 --> 01:18:27.824
...in pious contemplation...

793
01:18:29.659 --> 01:18:34.330
...finds he will meet
his Maker all too soon.

794
01:18:34.789 --> 01:18:38.960
For all his prayers
gets no remuneration.

795
01:18:43.548 --> 01:18:45.884
The lesson endeth here...

796
01:18:46.009 --> 01:18:48.553
...and it is this:

797
01:18:48.678 --> 01:18:53.266
Each one of you,
my clammy hands must touch.

798
01:18:54.267 --> 01:18:58.605
Each one must bend his
forehead to my kiss.

799
01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.317
But, hark!

800
01:19:02.442 --> 01:19:05.528
Methinks a mortal
doth approach!

801
01:19:08.156 --> 01:19:10.825
What have we here?

802
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:13.870
What beauty by my side?

803
01:19:14.454 --> 01:19:18.041
A rose in bloom,
a shrinking violet?

804
01:19:19.125 --> 01:19:22.378
Perhaps she has a mind
to be my bride.

805
01:19:22.503 --> 01:19:25.924
Perhaps my lesson
has not ended yet!

806
01:19:27.675 --> 01:19:29.510
I don't want to die!

807
01:19:29.636 --> 01:19:32.388
But Death we are
and have always been.

808
01:19:32.513 --> 01:19:34.140
Someone help me!

809
01:19:34.265 --> 01:19:36.684
Please!

810
01:19:45.735 --> 01:19:48.738
- What have I done?
- We all die!

811
01:19:48.863 --> 01:19:49.989
But I'm young!

812
01:19:50.114 --> 01:19:55.370
Death is no respecter of age!
It can come any time, any place.

813
01:20:08.883 --> 01:20:12.053
Just as this flesh
is pink now...

814
01:20:12.178 --> 01:20:15.473
...so it will turn gray
and wrinkle with age.

815
01:20:15.598 --> 01:20:17.475
Let me live!
I don't care!

816
01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.520
Then why should you care
if you die now?

817
01:20:20.645 --> 01:20:25.024
And suppose Death had a heart
to love and to release you?

818
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:27.443
To whom would he turn
his passion?

819
01:20:27.568 --> 01:20:30.571
Would you choose a person
from the crowd there?

820
01:20:30.697 --> 01:20:32.573
A person to suffer as you do?

821
01:20:32.699 --> 01:20:34.701
Monsieur Vampire, take me!

822
01:20:34.826 --> 01:20:37.203
I adore you!

823
01:20:37.328 --> 01:20:40.581
You wait your turn!

824
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:43.126
Well...

825
01:20:43.251 --> 01:20:48.005
Do you know what it means
to be loved by Death?

826
01:20:48.965 --> 01:20:52.468
To become our bride?

827
01:21:54.238 --> 01:21:56.574
No pain.

828
01:22:00.578 --> 01:22:02.914
No pain.

829
01:22:15.426 --> 01:22:17.678
Monstrous.

830
01:23:08.604 --> 01:23:10.815
We live beneath.

831
01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:13.359
Let me show you.

832
01:23:18.864 --> 01:23:21.283
Monstrous.

833
01:23:21.450 --> 01:23:23.703
Yes.

834
01:23:23.995 --> 01:23:26.747
But very beautiful.

835
01:23:48.185 --> 01:23:51.021
Welcome to my home.

836
01:24:05.911 --> 01:24:08.164
Try him.

837
01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:33.647
Two vampires...

838
01:24:33.898 --> 01:24:36.650
...from the New World...

839
01:24:36.775 --> 01:24:39.987
...come to guide us
into the new era...

840
01:24:40.112 --> 01:24:43.115
...as all we love slowly rots...

841
01:24:43.741 --> 01:24:46.327
...and fades away.

842
01:24:46.452 --> 01:24:49.455
Are you the leader
of this group?

843
01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.957
If there were a leader...

844
01:24:52.082 --> 01:24:53.792
...I would be the one.

845
01:24:53.918 --> 01:24:57.630
- So you have the answers?
- So you have questions?

846
01:24:59.757 --> 01:25:02.009
What are we?

847
01:25:03.344 --> 01:25:05.262
Nothing...

848
01:25:05.387 --> 01:25:08.140
...if not vampires.

849
01:25:10.976 --> 01:25:13.562
Who made us what we are?

850
01:25:13.687 --> 01:25:15.731
Surely you know the one
who made you?

851
01:25:15.856 --> 01:25:18.567
Yes, but the one
who made him?

852
01:25:18.692 --> 01:25:19.985
The source...

853
01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:22.363
...of all this...

854
01:25:22.529 --> 01:25:24.448
...evil.

855
01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:28.035
I understand.

856
01:25:28.994 --> 01:25:31.830
I saw you in the theater.

857
01:25:32.706 --> 01:25:35.459
Your suffering...

858
01:25:36.543 --> 01:25:39.463
...your sympathy for that girl.

859
01:25:40.631 --> 01:25:42.341
You die...

860
01:25:42.466 --> 01:25:44.718
...when you kill.

861
01:25:44.969 --> 01:25:49.556
You feel you deserve to die
and you stint on nothing.

862
01:25:50.724 --> 01:25:53.560
But does that make you evil?

863
01:25:53.852 --> 01:25:57.898
Since you comprehend what you call
goodness, doesn't that make you...

864
01:25:58.023 --> 01:25:59.733
...good?

865
01:25:59.858 --> 01:26:01.986
Then there is nothing?

866
01:26:02.111 --> 01:26:04.613
Perhaps.

867
01:26:05.614 --> 01:26:08.117
But perhaps...

868
01:26:09.159 --> 01:26:11.036
...this...

869
01:26:11.161 --> 01:26:14.498
...is the only real evil left.

870
01:26:15.082 --> 01:26:17.751
Then God does not exist?

871
01:26:17.876 --> 01:26:21.005
I know nothing of God.

872
01:26:21.296 --> 01:26:23.090
Or the Devil.

873
01:26:23.215 --> 01:26:27.428
I have never seen a vision,
nor learned a secret...

874
01:26:27.553 --> 01:26:31.390
...that would damn
or save my soul.

875
01:26:32.599 --> 01:26:34.226
As far as I know...

876
01:26:34.351 --> 01:26:37.312
...after 400 years...

877
01:26:37.438 --> 01:26:39.398
...I am the oldest...

878
01:26:39.523 --> 01:26:41.525
...living vampire...

879
01:26:41.650 --> 01:26:43.944
...in the world.

880
01:26:44.737 --> 01:26:48.073
Then it's as I always feared.

881
01:26:56.373 --> 01:26:59.084
You fear too much.

882
01:27:00.794 --> 01:27:03.630
So much you make me fear...

883
01:27:08.427 --> 01:27:10.929
The one who made you...

884
01:27:11.054 --> 01:27:13.891
...should have told you this.

885
01:27:14.475 --> 01:27:17.478
The one who left the
Old World for the New...

886
01:27:17.603 --> 01:27:19.104
He knew nothing.

887
01:27:19.229 --> 01:27:21.023
Nor did he care.

888
01:27:21.148 --> 01:27:22.232
Knew?

889
01:27:22.357 --> 01:27:24.526
Come, beloved.

890
01:27:24.777 --> 01:27:26.987
It's time we were on our way.

891
01:27:27.112 --> 01:27:28.197
I'm hungry...

892
01:27:28.322 --> 01:27:30.240
...and the city awaits.

893
01:27:31.575 --> 01:27:34.411
The place was empty
as we left.

894
01:27:34.536 --> 01:27:36.455
Silent as the grave.

895
01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:40.292
And as we blundered through it,
again came the thought:

896
01:27:40.417 --> 01:27:42.711
"I have wronged Lestat."

897
01:27:42.836 --> 01:27:45.130
"I have hated him
for the wrong reasons."

898
01:27:45.255 --> 01:27:47.716
How did you wrong him?

899
01:27:49.259 --> 01:27:50.886
You said a name.

900
01:27:51.011 --> 01:27:53.847
Yes, a name I don't
care to say again.

901
01:27:53.972 --> 01:27:55.974
There is but one crime...

902
01:27:56.099 --> 01:27:58.894
...among us vampires here.

903
01:27:59.394 --> 01:28:03.732
It is the crime that means
death to any vampire:

904
01:28:04.816 --> 01:28:07.611
To kill your own kind.

905
01:28:11.198 --> 01:28:14.576
- Do you think I'd let them harm you?
- No, you would not.

906
01:28:14.701 --> 01:28:16.495
Danger holds you to me.

907
01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:18.205
Love holds you to me.

908
01:28:18.330 --> 01:28:19.998
- Love?
- Love.

909
01:28:20.123 --> 01:28:24.002
You would leave me for Armand
if he beckoned you.

910
01:28:24.127 --> 01:28:25.379
Never.

911
01:28:25.504 --> 01:28:29.174
He wants you as you want him.
He's been waiting for you.

912
01:28:29.299 --> 01:28:31.760
He wants you as a companion.

913
01:28:31.885 --> 01:28:34.096
He bides his time there.

914
01:28:34.221 --> 01:28:36.974
He finds it as dull
and lifeless as we do.

915
01:28:37.099 --> 01:28:38.433
Perhaps.

916
01:28:38.558 --> 01:28:43.397
Do you know what his soul said to me
without saying a word?

917
01:28:43.939 --> 01:28:46.441
"Let him go," he said.

918
01:28:46.566 --> 01:28:49.027
"Let him go."

919
01:28:50.195 --> 01:28:53.323
Is that what I should do?

920
01:28:53.824 --> 01:28:56.326
Let you go?

921
01:28:56.618 --> 01:28:58.078
My father...

922
01:28:58.203 --> 01:28:59.788
...my Louis...

923
01:28:59.913 --> 01:29:02.291
...who made me?

924
01:29:03.417 --> 01:29:06.086
It will be all right.

925
01:29:06.545 --> 01:29:09.339
You really believe that?

926
01:29:16.972 --> 01:29:18.098
The soldier...

927
01:29:18.223 --> 01:29:20.517
...on returning from the war...

928
01:29:20.642 --> 01:29:24.688
...thinks victory has enured
him against sorrow...

929
01:29:24.813 --> 01:29:27.149
...till Death comes by...

930
01:29:27.274 --> 01:29:30.193
...and chops him
from his horse.

931
01:29:35.907 --> 01:29:38.577
I was waiting for you.

932
01:29:40.454 --> 01:29:42.664
Listen to me.

933
01:29:44.499 --> 01:29:47.252
Claudia is very dear to me.

934
01:29:47.377 --> 01:29:48.670
She's my daughter.

935
01:29:48.795 --> 01:29:51.089
Your lover.

936
01:29:51.214 --> 01:29:52.716
No, my beloved.

937
01:29:52.841 --> 01:29:55.135
My child.

938
01:29:55.927 --> 01:29:58.805
You say so.
You're innocent.

939
01:29:59.222 --> 01:30:01.391
She's in danger, isn't she?

940
01:30:01.516 --> 01:30:03.602
- She is.
- Why?

941
01:30:05.854 --> 01:30:09.024
I could give you reasons.

942
01:30:09.483 --> 01:30:12.194
Her silence.

943
01:30:12.319 --> 01:30:14.613
Her youth.

944
01:30:15.405 --> 01:30:18.575
It's forbidden
to make one so young...

945
01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:20.911
...so helpless...

946
01:30:21.036 --> 01:30:23.455
...that cannot survive
on its own.

947
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.415
Then blame the one
who made her.

948
01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:27.793
Did you kill this vampire
who made you both?

949
01:30:27.918 --> 01:30:29.586
Is that why you won't say
his name?

950
01:30:29.711 --> 01:30:31.463
Santiago thinks you did.

951
01:30:31.588 --> 01:30:35.342
- We want no quarrel with him.
- It's already begun.

952
01:30:36.092 --> 01:30:37.886
If you want to save her...

953
01:30:38.011 --> 01:30:41.348
- ...send her away!
- Then I leave too.

954
01:30:47.646 --> 01:30:49.981
So soon?

955
01:30:51.650 --> 01:30:55.320
Without any of those answers
you so longed for?

956
01:30:55.445 --> 01:30:56.696
You said there are none.

957
01:30:56.822 --> 01:30:59.866
But you asked
the wrong questions.

958
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:17.592
Do you know...

959
01:31:17.717 --> 01:31:20.554
...how few vampires...

960
01:31:20.845 --> 01:31:24.349
...have the stamina
for immortality?

961
01:31:25.684 --> 01:31:29.104
How quickly they perish
of their own will.

962
01:31:32.691 --> 01:31:34.943
The world...

963
01:31:35.068 --> 01:31:37.404
...changes.

964
01:31:38.738 --> 01:31:41.116
We do not.

965
01:31:42.033 --> 01:31:44.160
Therein lies the irony...

966
01:31:44.286 --> 01:31:46.830
...that finally kills us.

967
01:31:46.955 --> 01:31:51.126
I need you to make contact
with this age.

968
01:31:51.251 --> 01:31:53.044
Me?

969
01:31:53.169 --> 01:31:55.672
Don't you see?

970
01:31:55.797 --> 01:31:59.134
I'm not the spirit
of any age.

971
01:31:59.259 --> 01:32:01.386
I'm at odds with everything.

972
01:32:01.511 --> 01:32:04.180
I always have been.

973
01:32:05.015 --> 01:32:08.727
That is the very spirit
of your age.

974
01:32:09.394 --> 01:32:11.730
The heart of it.

975
01:32:12.689 --> 01:32:14.607
Your fall...

976
01:32:14.733 --> 01:32:16.693
...from grace...

977
01:32:16.818 --> 01:32:20.363
...has been the fall
of a century.

978
01:32:20.822 --> 01:32:23.700
But the vampires
in the theater?

979
01:32:24.868 --> 01:32:26.953
Decadent...

980
01:32:27.078 --> 01:32:29.414
...useless.

981
01:32:30.206 --> 01:32:33.084
They can't reflect anything.

982
01:32:33.209 --> 01:32:34.627
But...

983
01:32:34.753 --> 01:32:36.921
...you do.

984
01:32:38.465 --> 01:32:39.674
You reflect...

985
01:32:39.799 --> 01:32:42.302
...its broken heart.

986
01:32:54.606 --> 01:32:57.233
A vampire...

987
01:32:57.942 --> 01:33:00.737
...with a human soul.

988
01:33:01.237 --> 01:33:05.033
An immortal
with a mortal's passion.

989
01:33:06.701 --> 01:33:08.411
You...

990
01:33:08.536 --> 01:33:10.705
...are...

991
01:33:11.498 --> 01:33:14.334
...beautiful, my friend.

992
01:33:16.002 --> 01:33:20.006
Lestat must have wept
when he made you.

993
01:33:22.634 --> 01:33:25.136
You knew Lestat?

994
01:33:27.305 --> 01:33:29.474
Yes.

995
01:33:29.933 --> 01:33:32.227
I knew him.

996
01:33:33.394 --> 01:33:37.565
Knew him well enough
not to mourn his passing.

997
01:33:39.692 --> 01:33:42.862
I felt a kind of peace
at last.

998
01:33:42.987 --> 01:33:48.326
I had found the teacher which Lestat
could never, I knew now, have been.

999
01:33:48.493 --> 01:33:51.871
I knew knowledge would
never be withheld by Armand.

1000
01:33:51.996 --> 01:33:56.334
It would pass through him
as through a pane of glass.

1001
01:34:11.182 --> 01:34:13.351
Madeleine...

1002
01:34:13.518 --> 01:34:16.020
...Louis is shy.

1003
01:34:31.619 --> 01:34:33.705
Drink.

1004
01:34:34.581 --> 01:34:35.915
Do it.

1005
01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:39.294
Because I cannot do it.
I haven't the strength.

1006
01:34:39.419 --> 01:34:44.591
- You saw to that when you made me.
- You don't know what you ask!

1007
01:34:46.301 --> 01:34:47.135
I have.

1008
01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:51.431
You have found your new companion!
You will make me mine!

1009
01:34:51.681 --> 01:34:54.183
How do we seem to you?

1010
01:34:54.392 --> 01:34:56.603
Do you find us beautiful?

1011
01:34:56.728 --> 01:34:58.730
Magical?

1012
01:34:58.855 --> 01:35:04.193
Our white skin, our fierce eyes?
Do you know the thing you will become?

1013
01:35:04.319 --> 01:35:06.988
Your evil is that
you cannot be evil!

1014
01:35:07.113 --> 01:35:10.116
And I shall suffer
for it no longer!

1015
01:35:10.241 --> 01:35:13.077
Don't make me do this!
I cannot!

1016
01:35:13.202 --> 01:35:15.330
Yet, you could do it to me.

1017
01:35:15.455 --> 01:35:21.169
Snatching me from my mother's hands,
like two monsters in a fairy tale.

1018
01:35:21.294 --> 01:35:23.254
And now you weep!

1019
01:35:23.379 --> 01:35:26.549
I haven't tears enough
for what you've done to me!

1020
01:35:26.674 --> 01:35:28.885
You give her to me, Louis!

1021
01:35:29.010 --> 01:35:32.347
Do this before you leave me!

1022
01:35:34.057 --> 01:35:35.850
Oh, God!

1023
01:35:35.975 --> 01:35:38.269
I love you still!

1024
01:35:38.394 --> 01:35:41.397
That's the torment of it!

1025
01:35:41.731 --> 01:35:44.275
Who'll care for me,
my love...

1026
01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.154
...my dark angel,
when you are gone?

1027
01:35:54.494 --> 01:35:57.914
What do you think she is,
Madeleine?

1028
01:35:58.831 --> 01:36:01.084
A doll?

1029
01:36:03.378 --> 01:36:06.130
A child who cannot die.

1030
01:36:06.672 --> 01:36:09.509
And the child who did die?

1031
01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:13.096
My daughter.

1032
01:37:11.654 --> 01:37:13.281
What's happening to her?

1033
01:37:13.406 --> 01:37:15.741
She's dying.

1034
01:37:15.908 --> 01:37:18.244
It happened to you too...

1035
01:37:18.369 --> 01:37:21.873
...only you were too young
to remember.

1036
01:37:23.124 --> 01:37:25.793
But if she dies?

1037
01:37:26.085 --> 01:37:29.088
It's only mortal death.

1038
01:37:32.091 --> 01:37:35.344
Bear me no ill will, my love.

1039
01:37:37.555 --> 01:37:40.308
We are now even.

1040
01:37:40.808 --> 01:37:43.227
What do you mean?

1041
01:37:43.936 --> 01:37:48.107
What died in that room
was not that woman.

1042
01:37:51.235 --> 01:37:53.905
What has died is the...

1043
01:37:54.614 --> 01:37:57.450
...last breath in me...

1044
01:37:57.658 --> 01:38:00.328
...that was human.

1045
01:38:03.998 --> 01:38:06.584
Yes, Father.

1046
01:38:06.876 --> 01:38:09.629
At last we are even.

1047
01:38:14.634 --> 01:38:18.387
It's time for justice,
little one.

1048
01:38:35.154 --> 01:38:38.574
Get me Armand.
He wouldn't stand for this.

1049
01:38:38.699 --> 01:38:41.118
Death for the others.

1050
01:38:41.243 --> 01:38:42.745
For you...

1051
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:45.998
...eternity in a box.

1052
01:38:46.499 --> 01:38:48.459
Walled in a dungeon.

1053
01:38:48.584 --> 01:38:51.879
Your only company
will be your screams.

1054
01:38:52.254 --> 01:38:55.383
Perhaps it will
take centuries.

1055
01:38:56.384 --> 01:38:58.344
Take them!

1056
01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.591
Pleasant dreams.

1057
01:40:20.217 --> 01:40:22.970
No! No!

1058
01:40:23.345 --> 01:40:25.598
Help!

1059
01:41:02.217 --> 01:41:04.261
Wake up!

1060
01:42:13.414 --> 01:42:15.499
Where's Claudia?

1061
01:42:15.624 --> 01:42:18.752
Claudia. I cannot help her.

1062
01:42:18.877 --> 01:42:22.214
- Where's Claudia?
- I can't save her!

1063
01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:26.468
I will only risk losing you!

1064
01:42:28.011 --> 01:42:30.097
Don't!

1065
01:44:21.708 --> 01:44:23.877
Come, Louis.

1066
01:44:24.503 --> 01:44:26.713
Not here.

1067
01:44:34.805 --> 01:44:37.933
So a vampire can cry?

1068
01:44:39.518 --> 01:44:40.978
Once...

1069
01:44:41.103 --> 01:44:43.855
...maybe twice, in eternity.

1070
01:44:45.232 --> 01:44:49.778
And maybe it was to quench those tears
forever that I took such revenge.

1071
01:45:48.587 --> 01:45:51.381
Stop him! It's burning!

1072
01:45:51.506 --> 01:45:53.884
Get him! Stop him!

1073
01:48:04.097 --> 01:48:07.225
You didn't even warn them,
did you?

1074
01:48:08.601 --> 01:48:10.478
No.

1075
01:48:11.938 --> 01:48:15.066
And you knew what I would do.

1076
01:48:15.567 --> 01:48:17.318
I knew.

1077
01:48:17.444 --> 01:48:19.571
I rescued you, didn't I?

1078
01:48:19.696 --> 01:48:22.407
From the terrible dawn.

1079
01:48:26.202 --> 01:48:29.039
You were their leader.
They trusted you.

1080
01:48:29.164 --> 01:48:30.999
No.

1081
01:48:31.374 --> 01:48:34.711
You made me see
their failings, Louis.

1082
01:48:35.545 --> 01:48:36.880
They were...

1083
01:48:37.005 --> 01:48:40.675
...doomed, stuck
in their decadent time.

1084
01:48:40.925 --> 01:48:43.762
They had forgotten
the first lesson...

1085
01:48:43.887 --> 01:48:46.055
...that we must be powerful...

1086
01:48:46.181 --> 01:48:47.599
...beautiful...

1087
01:48:47.724 --> 01:48:50.268
...and without regret.

1088
01:48:50.518 --> 01:48:52.145
You can teach me this?

1089
01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:53.897
Yes.

1090
01:48:54.022 --> 01:48:56.858
To be without regret?

1091
01:48:58.359 --> 01:49:01.488
Then, what a pair
we could make.

1092
01:49:03.615 --> 01:49:07.619
But what if it's a lesson
I don't care to learn?

1093
01:49:08.578 --> 01:49:09.913
What?

1094
01:49:10.038 --> 01:49:12.999
What if all I have
is my suffering?

1095
01:49:13.124 --> 01:49:15.794
My regret?

1096
01:49:16.795 --> 01:49:18.797
Don't you want to lose it?

1097
01:49:18.922 --> 01:49:21.758
So you can have that too?

1098
01:49:21.883 --> 01:49:24.469
The heart that mourns her...

1099
01:49:24.594 --> 01:49:26.930
...whom you burnt to a cinder?

1100
01:49:27.055 --> 01:49:28.681
I swear I didn't...

1101
01:49:28.807 --> 01:49:31.267
But I know you did.

1102
01:49:31.434 --> 01:49:33.561
I know...

1103
01:49:34.354 --> 01:49:36.147
...you...

1104
01:49:36.272 --> 01:49:38.816
...regret nothing.

1105
01:49:40.068 --> 01:49:42.237
You feel...

1106
01:49:42.362 --> 01:49:44.364
...nothing.

1107
01:49:45.657 --> 01:49:49.035
If that's all
I have left to learn...

1108
01:49:49.994 --> 01:49:52.830
...I can do that on my own.

1109
01:50:02.924 --> 01:50:04.342
I will die.

1110
01:50:04.467 --> 01:50:05.218
No.

1111
01:50:05.343 --> 01:50:06.928
You are dead.

1112
01:50:07.053 --> 01:50:10.598
And you want me to
quicken you once more.

1113
01:50:12.308 --> 01:50:16.771
And as much as your invitation
might appeal to me...

1114
01:50:17.522 --> 01:50:19.649
...I must regretfully...

1115
01:50:19.774 --> 01:50:21.776
...decline.

1116
01:50:34.414 --> 01:50:36.666
For years I wandered:

1117
01:50:36.791 --> 01:50:39.127
Italy, Greece...

1118
01:50:39.252 --> 01:50:41.587
...all the ancient lands.

1119
01:50:41.713 --> 01:50:44.340
But the world was a tomb to me...

1120
01:50:44.465 --> 01:50:47.844
...a graveyard
full of broken statues.

1121
01:50:47.969 --> 01:50:52.390
And each of those statues
resembled her face.

1122
01:50:57.895 --> 01:50:59.772
Then, out of curiosity...

1123
01:50:59.897 --> 01:51:02.025
...boredom, who knows what...

1124
01:51:02.150 --> 01:51:03.776
...I left the Old World...

1125
01:51:03.901 --> 01:51:06.988
...and came back
to my America.

1126
01:51:09.532 --> 01:51:14.037
And there a mechanical wonder
allowed me to see the sunrise...

1127
01:51:14.162 --> 01:51:16.122
...for the first time...

1128
01:51:16.247 --> 01:51:18.916
...in 200 years.

1129
01:51:19.459 --> 01:51:21.878
And what sunrises!

1130
01:51:22.003 --> 01:51:25.757
Seen as the human eye
could never see them.

1131
01:51:25.882 --> 01:51:28.384
Silver at first...

1132
01:51:28.509 --> 01:51:31.763
...then, as the years progressed,
in tones of purple...

1133
01:51:31.888 --> 01:51:33.181
...red...

1134
01:51:33.306 --> 01:51:36.559
...and my long-lost blue.

1135
01:51:40.688 --> 01:51:44.859
In the spring of 1988,
I returned to New Orleans.

1136
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:49.530
And as soon as I smelled
the air, I knew I was home.

1137
01:51:50.073 --> 01:51:51.532
It was rich...

1138
01:51:51.657 --> 01:51:53.451
...almost sweet...

1139
01:51:53.576 --> 01:51:58.581
...like the fragrance of jasmine
and roses around our old courtyard.

1140
01:51:59.290 --> 01:52:04.629
I walked the streets savoring
that long-lost perfume.

1141
01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:11.803
And then on Prytania Street...

1142
01:52:11.928 --> 01:52:15.181
...only blocks from the
Lafayette cemetery...

1143
01:52:15.306 --> 01:52:18.059
...I caught the scent of death.

1144
01:52:18.184 --> 01:52:21.521
And it wasn't coming
from the graves.

1145
01:52:22.438 --> 01:52:25.358
The scent grew stronger
as I walked.

1146
01:52:25.483 --> 01:52:27.360
Old death.

1147
01:52:27.485 --> 01:52:30.988
A scent too faint
for mortals to detect.

1148
01:54:06.334 --> 01:54:09.253
I'm so glad you are here!

1149
01:54:09.378 --> 01:54:11.797
I've dreamed...

1150
01:54:11.922 --> 01:54:14.592
...of this moment.

1151
01:54:15.468 --> 01:54:18.471
She never should
have been one of...

1152
01:54:18.596 --> 01:54:20.306
...us.

1153
01:54:20.431 --> 01:54:23.267
That's all past, Lestat.

1154
01:54:27.313 --> 01:54:29.648
Past.

1155
01:54:53.214 --> 01:54:56.217
Still beautiful, Louis.

1156
01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:01.597
You always were
the strong one.

1157
01:55:05.226 --> 01:55:07.728
Don't be frightened.

1158
01:55:11.232 --> 01:55:13.984
I mean you no harm.

1159
01:55:17.071 --> 01:55:19.990
You've come home
to me then?

1160
01:55:23.911 --> 01:55:27.164
You remember how I was?

1161
01:55:28.541 --> 01:55:30.334
The vampire...

1162
01:55:30.459 --> 01:55:33.129
...that I was?

1163
01:55:33.504 --> 01:55:36.006
Yes, I remember.

1164
01:55:41.929 --> 01:55:43.180
No one...

1165
01:55:43.305 --> 01:55:45.891
...could refuse me...

1166
01:55:46.725 --> 01:55:48.978
...not even you.

1167
01:55:49.854 --> 01:55:51.897
I tried.

1168
01:55:52.022 --> 01:55:54.692
Yes, you tried.

1169
01:55:55.317 --> 01:55:58.153
And the more you tried...

1170
01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:04.493
...the more I wanted you.

1171
01:56:14.545 --> 01:56:17.131
I can't bear it.

1172
01:56:18.883 --> 01:56:21.135
Such lights...

1173
01:56:22.011 --> 01:56:24.513
...and that noise!

1174
01:56:25.431 --> 01:56:29.268
They make the night
brighter than the day.

1175
01:56:37.234 --> 01:56:39.403
It's false light.

1176
01:56:39.528 --> 01:56:42.114
It can't harm you.

1177
01:56:53.083 --> 01:56:56.503
If you stay with me, Louis...

1178
01:56:57.254 --> 01:57:00.049
...I could venture out again.

1179
01:57:02.384 --> 01:57:05.304
Become the old Lestat.

1180
01:57:06.138 --> 01:57:08.807
I must leave now.

1181
01:57:37.336 --> 01:57:40.839
Whatever happened to Lestat,
I do not know.

1182
01:57:41.507 --> 01:57:43.050
I go on...

1183
01:57:43.175 --> 01:57:45.052
...night after night.

1184
01:57:45.177 --> 01:57:48.514
I feed on those
who cross my path.

1185
01:57:50.557 --> 01:57:54.645
But all my passion went
with her golden hair.

1186
01:57:57.189 --> 01:58:01.026
I'm a spirit
of preternatural flesh.

1187
01:58:01.527 --> 01:58:04.029
Detached.

1188
01:58:04.154 --> 01:58:06.323
Unchangeable.

1189
01:58:08.575 --> 01:58:10.661
Empty.

1190
01:58:10.994 --> 01:58:12.621
Empty?

1191
01:58:12.746 --> 01:58:14.748
That's it?

1192
01:58:16.333 --> 01:58:19.086
No, it can't end like that.

1193
01:58:19.962 --> 01:58:21.588
But it has.

1194
01:58:21.713 --> 01:58:24.299
There's no more to tell.

1195
01:58:24.508 --> 01:58:30.013
There must be more to tell. You don't
understand yourself. You're not empty.

1196
01:58:30.139 --> 01:58:33.517
What I wouldn't give to be like you,
to have your power...

1197
01:58:33.642 --> 01:58:36.103
...to have seen the things
you have seen.

1198
01:58:36.228 --> 01:58:37.688
You haven't been listening.

1199
01:58:37.813 --> 01:58:40.732
I have been listening.
Your story is incredible.

1200
01:58:40.858 --> 01:58:42.943
- It's amazing.
- Do what you want with it.

1201
01:58:43.068 --> 01:58:45.863
Give it to others.
Learn what you can.

1202
01:58:45.988 --> 01:58:49.950
There's only one way I'll
truly learn and you know it.

1203
01:58:50.075 --> 01:58:52.911
You brought me here
for a reason.

1204
01:58:53.036 --> 01:58:54.121
Didn't you?

1205
01:58:54.246 --> 01:58:56.123
What reason would that be?

1206
01:58:56.248 --> 01:59:00.460
You want a companion. You want a link
to the outside world. That's me.

1207
01:59:00.586 --> 01:59:03.046
Take me.
That's what I want.

1208
01:59:03.171 --> 01:59:07.009
- I refuse to let it end like this.
- God, I've failed again.

1209
01:59:07.134 --> 01:59:10.971
You haven't failed.
God has nothing to do with it.

1210
01:59:13.473 --> 01:59:15.684
Do you like this?

1211
01:59:15.809 --> 01:59:19.521
Do you like being food
for the immortals?

1212
01:59:19.646 --> 01:59:20.981
Do you like dying?

1213
01:59:21.106 --> 01:59:23.025
Stop!

1214
02:00:32.886 --> 02:00:35.639
1791 was the year
it happened.

1215
02:00:35.764 --> 02:00:39.851
I was 24.
Younger than you are now.

1216
02:00:40.018 --> 02:00:43.188
But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.

1217
02:00:43.313 --> 02:00:47.734
The master of a large plantation,
just south of New Orleans.

1218
02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:51.113
I had lost my wife
in childbirth.

1219
02:00:51.238 --> 02:00:53.031
Someone change my shorts.

1220
02:00:53.156 --> 02:00:56.326
She and the infant had been
buried less than half a year.

1221
02:00:56.451 --> 02:00:57.202
It's good stuff.

1222
02:00:57.327 --> 02:00:58.745
I would've been happy
to join them.

1223
02:00:58.870 --> 02:01:01.456
Good stuff.

1224
02:01:04.376 --> 02:01:07.462
I assume
I need no introduction.

1225
02:01:21.852 --> 02:01:24.688
I feel better already.

1226
02:01:28.358 --> 02:01:31.820
Most of all,
I longed for death.

1227
02:01:31.945 --> 02:01:34.364
I invited it.

1228
02:01:34.739 --> 02:01:38.160
A release
from the pain of living.

1229
02:01:40.996 --> 02:01:43.582
Still whining.

1230
02:01:45.584 --> 02:01:47.377
Heard enough?

1231
02:01:47.502 --> 02:01:50.881
I've had to listen to that
for centuries.

1232
02:01:52.924 --> 02:01:55.135
Don't be afraid.

1233
02:01:56.887 --> 02:02:00.140
I'm going to give you
the choice...

1234
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:02.976
...I never had.
