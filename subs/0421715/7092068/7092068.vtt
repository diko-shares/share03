1
00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:33.365
Hurricane Katrina on satellite...

2
00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.830
The storm system's still moving west...

3
00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:43.917
What are you looking at, Caroline?

4
00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:46.378
The wind, Mom.

5
00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.425
They say the hurricane is coming.

6
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.846
I'm on a boat.

7
00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:59.308
I'm drifting.

8
00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:03.228
Can I do anything for you, Mom?

9
00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.732
Make anything easier?

10
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.984
Oh, sugar...

11
00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.737
...there's nothing left to do.

12
00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.447
Is what it is.

13
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:19.036
Finding it harder to keep my eyes open.

14
00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:23.415
My mouth's full of cotton.

15
00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.292
- Shh.
- There, there, Miss Daisy.

16
00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:28.754
You gonna scratch yourself to ribbons.

17
00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.511
Do you want any more medication,
Mother?

18
00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:40.349
Doctor says you could have
as much as you want.

19
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.768
No need for anybody to suffer.

20
00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.324
A, uh...

21
00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:03.497
A friend told me that she never had
the chance to say goodbye to her mother.

22
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.460
- I wanted to--
- It's okay.

23
00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:14.216
I wanted to tell you how much
I'm gonna miss you so, Mom.

24
00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:18.387
Oh, Caroline.

25
00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:24.685
Are you afraid?

26
00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:27.563
I'm curious.

27
00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:31.066
What comes next?

28
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.160
They built the train station in 1918.

29
00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:44.037
My father was there the day it opened.

30
00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:49.543
He said they had...

31
00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.753
...a tuba band playing.

32
00:02:56.467 --> 00:03:01.013
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South...

33
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.891
...to build that glorious clock.

34
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.061
His name was...

35
00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:12.191
...Mr. Gateau.

36
00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.737
Mr. Cake.

37
00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:24.411
He was married to a Creole
of Evangeline Parish...

38
00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.538
...and they had a son.

39
00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:30.375
Mr. Gateau was, from birth...

40
00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:34.004
...absolutely blind.

41
00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:39.259
When their son was old enough,
he joined the Army.

42
00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:45.641
And they prayed God would keep him
out of harm's way.

43
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.482
For months, he did nothing
but work on that clock.

44
00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.320
One day...

45
00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:01.490
...a letter came.

46
00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:10.499
And Mr. Gateau, done for the night...

47
00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.460
...went up, alone, to bed.

48
00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:19.675
And their son came home.

49
00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:26.640
They buried him in the family plot...

50
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:31.687
...where he would be with them
when their time came.

51
00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:36.525
Mr. Cake worked on his clock...

52
00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.529
...laboring...

53
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.948
...to finish.

54
00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:47.869
It was a morning to remember.

55
00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:52.666
Papa said there were people everywhere.

56
00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:55.836
Even Teddy Roosevelt came.

57
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.188
It's running backwards!

58
00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:18.817
I made it that way...

59
00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.988
...so that perhaps the boys
that we lost in the war...

60
00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.157
...might stand and come home again.

61
00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:30.912
Home to farm...

62
00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.081
...work...

63
00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.084
...have children.

64
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:42.299
To live long, full lives.

65
00:05:44.635 --> 00:05:47.095
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

66
00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:57.606
I'm sorry if I've offended anybody.

67
00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.902
I hope you enjoy my clock.

68
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:07.240
Mr. Cake was never seen again.

69
00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:17.084
Some say he died of a broken heart.

70
00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:21.129
Some say he went to sea.

71
00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:29.054
Excuse me. Do you mind if I make a call?
Somebody's watching my little boy.

72
00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.472
Sure.

73
00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.651
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

74
00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:47.322
You couldn't disappoint me.

75
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.990
Well, I...

76
00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:53.245
I know I don't have much
to show for myself.

77
00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:57.499
In my dark suitcase.

78
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:05.632
There's a diary.

79
00:07:06.717 --> 00:07:08.510
- This?
- Mm.

80
00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:13.807
Could you read it to me?

81
00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:15.684
Is this what you wanna do?

82
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.064
I tried to read it a hundred
different times.

83
00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.191
Mom, it's not exactly...

84
00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:27.195
Just the sound of your voice, darling.

85
00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:29.030
Okay.

86
00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:35.620
It's dated, April 4th, 1985.

87
00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:37.038
It says "New Orleans."

88
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.376
"This is my last will and testament.

89
00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:45.547
I don't have much to leave,
few possessions, no money, really.

90
00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:51.386
I will go out of this world the same way
I came in: alone and with nothing.

91
00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.388
All I have is my story...

92
00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:57.058
...and I'm writing it now
while I still remember it.

93
00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.436
My name is Benjamin.

94
00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.229
- Benjamin Button."
- Benjamin Button.

95
00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:05.150
And I was born under
unusual circumstances.

96
00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:08.153
The First World War had ended...

97
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:12.866
...and I've been told it was
an especially good night to be born.

98
00:08:13.784 --> 00:08:15.494
Thank God it's over!

99
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:18.914
- We won the war!
- Whoo!

100
00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.554
We won the war!

101
00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:49.819
- What are you doing here?
- Thomas...

102
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.197
...I'm afraid she's gonna die.

103
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.615
What?

104
00:08:54.408 --> 00:08:58.954
That's enough.
All of you, get away from her.

105
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.334
I came as quickly as I could.
The streets are filled with people--

106
00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.794
Thomas.

107
00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.588
Promise me he has a place.

108
00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.592
Yeah.

109
00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:15.095
She gave her life for me.

110
00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:19.766
And for that, I am forever grateful.

111
00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:31.069
Mr. Button.

112
00:09:46.043 --> 00:09:47.335
Thomas!

113
00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:49.212
Thomas.

114
00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:52.257
Thomas? Where are you going?

115
00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.830
Hey! What are you doing there?

116
00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:27.000
What do you have there?

117
00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:24.766
Shh.

118
00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:26.935
- Come on, Queenie. It'll be okay.
- Mr. Weathers.

119
00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.813
Come on, you know I got nothing
but work to do around here.

120
00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:32.732
- Come on. Just take some time.
- Stop all this foolishness.

121
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.026
Oh, time.

122
00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:38.196
The air is sweet.

123
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:45.370
You look very handsome tonight,
Miss Queenie.

124
00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:49.207
Handsome as I ever seen.

125
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.335
The brown matches your eyes.

126
00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:53.545
Oh, hush.

127
00:11:55.631 --> 00:12:00.093
Now, see here.
You ain't no slouch yourself.

128
00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:10.270
Hambert's back in town.

129
00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:13.440
He came home legless, but, uh, he home.

130
00:12:14.775 --> 00:12:17.235
- I know you were sweet on him one time--
- Ugh.

131
00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:19.779
Sweeter than I should've been.

132
00:12:19.947 --> 00:12:21.656
Miss Simone messed herself.

133
00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:25.618
Oh, sweet Jesus. She got to stop doing that
or it's diapers for her.

134
00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:27.620
- Be right there, Miss Jameson.
- Queenie.

135
00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:28.830
Now, come on.

136
00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.415
Okay, Queenie. Queenie'll be right there.

137
00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:31.833
It's awful nice out here.

138
00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:34.919
Come on out back for a moment.
Take your mind off things.

139
00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:36.337
- You're so bad.
- Wah!

140
00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:38.506
- What in God's name?
- What's this?

141
00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:51.186
Oh, the Lord done something here.

142
00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:54.355
Hope I didn't hurt it none
stepping on it like that.

143
00:12:55.232 --> 00:12:56.858
We best leave that for the police.

144
00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:58.943
Poor baby.

145
00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:01.070
I'll go.

146
00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:03.406
It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it.

147
00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:05.116
Come on, baby.

148
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:09.954
Queenie? Where are you, Queenie?

149
00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:11.956
Hold your water! You go deal with it.

150
00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:14.209
- Queenie--
- No, go. Shh. I'll be back.

151
00:13:15.085 --> 00:13:18.213
Queenie, Apple, she went
and messed herself all over again!

152
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.340
Jane Childress, start her a bath!

153
00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:24.344
And mind your own business, Mrs. Duprey.
You'll be messing yourself soon enough.

154
00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:26.137
Somebody stole my necklace.

155
00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:29.182
Okay. All right, Mrs. Hollister,
I'll be right with you, okay?

156
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.934
Go on back upstairs, hear?

157
00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:40.193
You are as ugly as an old pot...

158
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:41.903
...but you still a child of God.

159
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.364
Queenie, Apple,
she won't take a bath without you!

160
00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:45.990
Mercy.

161
00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:48.535
I'll be right there!

162
00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:54.916
Okay. You just wait right here for me,
okay?

163
00:13:57.586 --> 00:14:01.923
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

164
00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:03.758
Somebody's been stealing my jewelry.

165
00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:05.927
They're right here, Mrs. Hollister. See?

166
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:09.430
Right around your pretty white neck.
Now, come on. Hush all that noise.

167
00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:13.059
- Is Dr. Rose still here?
- I don't know.

168
00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.062
Well, your heart is strong.

169
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.691
You just want
to avoid any undue stimulation.

170
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:22.443
I trust you ladies will help me out
with that?

171
00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:26.030
I have something.
Could you come downstairs?

172
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.538
Never seen anything like it.
Nearly blind from cataracts.

173
00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.582
I'm not sure if he can hear.

174
00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:38.334
His bones indicate severe arthritis.

175
00:14:38.502 --> 00:14:42.213
His skin has lost all elasticity,
and his hands and feet are ossified.

176
00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:47.468
He shows all the deterioration,
the infirmities not of a newborn...

177
00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:50.471
...but of a man well in his 80s
on his way to the grave.

178
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:52.473
- He's dying?
- His body's failing him...

179
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:55.268
...before his life's begun.

180
00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:58.646
Where'd he come from?

181
00:14:58.814 --> 00:15:02.942
My sister's child. From Lafayette.
She had an unfortunate adventure.

182
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:08.114
The poor child, he got the worst of it.
Come out white.

183
00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:14.913
There are places for unwanted babies
like these, Queenie.

184
00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:18.041
No room for another mouth to feed here.

185
00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:20.710
The Nolan Foundation,
despite their good intentions...

186
00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:23.838
...thinks this place is a large nuisance
as it is.

187
00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:25.840
- A baby--
- You said he don't have long.

188
00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:31.512
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

189
00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:37.685
No, this baby, he is a miracle.
That's for certain.

190
00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:40.313
Just not the kind of miracle
one hopes to see.

191
00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:46.986
Y'all listen. Y'all listen up here.

192
00:15:47.154 --> 00:15:51.199
We gonna have us a visitor that's gonna
be staying with us for a little while.

193
00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:56.287
My sister had a child,
and she couldn't see right by it, so...

194
00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:59.874
He's known as...

195
00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:03.711
...Benjamin.

196
00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:06.005
Benjamin.

197
00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:09.634
He's not a well child, so we're gonna
have to take good care of him.

198
00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:13.346
I had 10 children. There's not a baby
I can't care for. Let me see him.

199
00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:20.895
Oh, God in heaven.
He looks just like my ex-husband.

200
00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:23.356
Look, he's prematurely old.

201
00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:26.734
Dr. Rose said he ain't got much
more time on this earth.

202
00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.153
Well, join the club. Heh, heh.

203
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:35.201
He's smiling.

204
00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:44.335
Hambert sends his remembrances to you.

205
00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:56.597
Are you right out of your mind?

206
00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:01.644
I know you ain't got all the parts it takes
to make one of your own...

207
00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:04.731
...but this ain't yours to keep.
It may not even be humankind.

208
00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:17.535
Mr. Weathers, come back here.

209
00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:20.872
Please.

210
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.890
You never know what's coming for you.

211
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.862
It seemed I had found a home.

212
00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:56.574
Is any of this true?

213
00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:59.994
You have such a lovely voice.

214
00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:05.541
Oh, Mom. It's an ancient streetcar token.

215
00:18:06.543 --> 00:18:10.213
That clock just kept going...

216
00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:12.340
...year after...

217
00:18:13.383 --> 00:18:16.302
...year after year.

218
00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:21.140
But I didn't know I was a child.

219
00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:24.519
Same old crap every day.

220
00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:27.814
I thought I was like everyone else there.

221
00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:30.650
An old man in the twilight of his life.

222
00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:33.069
Could you make him stop that?

223
00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:36.989
Stop banging that fork.
It's used for eating, not for playing with.

224
00:18:37.157 --> 00:18:40.701
And use your napkin, please,
Mr. Benjamin.

225
00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:44.122
Queenie!

226
00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:57.343
Hey, boy.

227
00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:06.394
Always had a healthy curiosity.

228
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.316
What was up the street?
Or around the next corner?

229
00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:14.443
Go get him!

230
00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:18.865
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here.

231
00:19:19.032 --> 00:19:21.325
Stay put, child.

232
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:25.580
I loved her very much.

233
00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:27.415
She was my mother.

234
00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.292
Mama.

235
00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:31.169
Mama.

236
00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:36.090
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

237
00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:41.345
Everybody feels different about themselves,
one way or another.

238
00:19:41.638 --> 00:19:43.723
But we all going the same way.

239
00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:48.811
Just taking different roads
to get there, that's all.

240
00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:52.190
You're on your own road, Benjamin.

241
00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:57.278
Mama? How much longer I got?

242
00:19:57.446 --> 00:20:00.573
Just be thankful
for what you're given, hear?

243
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:03.159
You already here longer than
you supposed to.

244
00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:10.458
Some nights I'd have to sleep alone.

245
00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.676
I didn't mind.

246
00:20:20.844 --> 00:20:23.804
I would listen to the house breathing.

247
00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.474
All those people sleeping.

248
00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:31.812
I felt safe.

249
00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:53.042
It was a place of great routine.

250
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.252
Mr. Winslow!

251
00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:57.046
Every morning at 5:30,
no matter the weather...

252
00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:08.182
Mrs. Sybil Wagner,
once an opera singer of some note...

253
00:21:10.018 --> 00:21:11.227
...well, she sang Wagner.

254
00:21:22.823 --> 00:21:24.031
All right, baby, come on.

255
00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:27.827
We got to put some life
into these old sticks for you.

256
00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:31.205
Get you walking so you can help me out
around here. Come on now, hear?

257
00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:37.545
No matter the season,
supper was served promptly at 5:30.

258
00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:39.672
"Molasses."

259
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.884
Molasses.

260
00:21:44.761 --> 00:21:47.930
I learned to read when I was 5.

261
00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:51.726
My grandfather was a dresser
for a famous actor.

262
00:21:51.893 --> 00:21:55.229
He brung home every play for me to read.

263
00:21:56.898 --> 00:22:01.402
Kind keepers of my weak decaying age...

264
00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:05.698
...let dying Mortimer here rest himself.

265
00:22:05.866 --> 00:22:08.492
Even like a man new haled
from the rack...

266
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.996
...so fare my limbs
with long imprisonment.

267
00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:15.541
And these gray locks,
the pursuivants of death...

268
00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:20.421
...argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.

269
00:22:23.383 --> 00:22:25.718
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

270
00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:31.140
The actor my grandfather worked for
was John Wilkes Booth.

271
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:33.684
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

272
00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:38.856
Never know what's coming for you.

273
00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:43.444
On Saturday nights,
Mama would make me go to church.

274
00:22:46.948 --> 00:22:48.491
Benjamin!

275
00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.503
Amen.

276
00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:05.549
What can I do for you, sister?

277
00:23:14.976 --> 00:23:19.772
Her parts are all twisted up inside
and she can't have little children.

278
00:23:19.981 --> 00:23:21.565
Oh.

279
00:23:24.444 --> 00:23:28.280
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins...

280
00:23:28.448 --> 00:23:30.533
...so she can bear the fruit of the womb.

281
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.743
- Out, damnable affliction!
- Aah!

282
00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:35.162
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

283
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.165
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

284
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.420
And what's this old man's irrediction?

285
00:23:44.798 --> 00:23:46.340
He's got the devil on his back...

286
00:23:46.508 --> 00:23:49.677
...trying to ride him into the grave
before his time.

287
00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:54.181
- Out, Zebuchar!
- Yes.

288
00:23:54.349 --> 00:23:55.850
- Out, Beelzebub!
- Yes!

289
00:23:58.145 --> 00:23:59.645
How old are you?

290
00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:02.481
Seven. But I look a lot older.

291
00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:04.942
God bless you.

292
00:24:05.569 --> 00:24:07.027
He's 7.

293
00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:11.699
Now, this is a man...

294
00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:14.618
- ...with optimism in his heart.
- All right.

295
00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:16.787
- Belief in his soul.
- Yes.

296
00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:18.789
We are all children in the eyes of God!

297
00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:19.999
- Yes.
- Hallelujah.

298
00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:22.877
- We are gonna get you out of that chair.
- Yes.

299
00:24:23.044 --> 00:24:25.713
- And we gonna have you walk.
- Come on.

300
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:27.465
It's all right.

301
00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:31.552
In the name of God's glory...

302
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.096
- ...rise up!
- Yes.

303
00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:36.182
Come on.

304
00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:39.393
Walk.

305
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:41.020
- Come on, son.
- Amen.

306
00:24:41.188 --> 00:24:43.063
- Come on with it, son.
- Come on.

307
00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.901
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

308
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.114
He's gonna see this little old man walk
without the use of a crutch or a cane.

309
00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:56.076
He's gonna see that you walk from faith
and divine inspiration alone.

310
00:24:56.244 --> 00:24:57.411
- All right.
- Yes!

311
00:24:57.579 --> 00:24:58.829
Amen!

312
00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:00.581
- Now walk.
- Come on.

313
00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.169
Don't touch him.

314
00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.840
Rise up, old man.

315
00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:12.468
- Rise up like Lazarus.
- Praise the Lord!

316
00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:14.803
I said, rise up!

317
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.184
Yes.

318
00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.852
- Come on.
- Come on, now.

319
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.187
Say hallelujah.

320
00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:24.855
Hallelujah!

321
00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:27.775
Walk.

322
00:25:28.235 --> 00:25:30.611
Walk on. Yes.

323
00:25:34.157 --> 00:25:35.241
That's right, Benjamin.

324
00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:38.452
Now when I look back on it,
it was miraculous.

325
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.120
But you know the saying:

326
00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:42.289
The Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

327
00:25:42.457 --> 00:25:45.918
Praise be to God in the highest!

328
00:25:48.838 --> 00:25:50.130
Sweet Jesus!

329
00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:55.302
There were so many birthdays.

330
00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:01.350
So we wouldn't run out,
we would spare the candles.

331
00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:05.271
Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays,
and I don't like cake.

332
00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:11.360
And death was a common visitor.
People came and went.

333
00:26:12.112 --> 00:26:17.324
You always knew when someone left us.
There was a silence in the house.

334
00:26:31.172 --> 00:26:33.382
It was a wonderful place to grow up.

335
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:38.262
I was with people who had shed
all the inconsequences of earlier life.

336
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.851
Left wondering about the weather,
the temperature of a bath...

337
00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:46.562
...the light at the end of a day.

338
00:26:50.734 --> 00:26:55.571
For every one that died,
someone would come to take their place.

339
00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:58.282
I've been married five times.

340
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:02.161
My first wife and I are captured by
a neighbor tribe of cannibals.

341
00:27:02.329 --> 00:27:04.872
- Oh, my goodness gracious.
- We escaped across the river.

342
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.334
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

343
00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:09.668
Oh, my. That's terrible.

344
00:27:09.836 --> 00:27:12.630
My second wife steps on cobra and dies.

345
00:27:13.173 --> 00:27:15.966
It was very bad luck to be married to me.

346
00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:19.178
That's Mr. Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

347
00:27:19.387 --> 00:27:21.388
OTl: The next summer...
- He's a Pygmy.

348
00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:23.390
OTl:
...I'm captured by the Baschiele tribe.

349
00:27:23.558 --> 00:27:27.895
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer
to a very strange American man.

350
00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:52.586
I hear you're not so old as you're looking.
You're just fooling everybody.

351
00:27:52.796 --> 00:27:55.714
What's the matter?
Did you get madjembe?

352
00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:57.091
What's madjembe?

353
00:27:57.258 --> 00:27:58.592
Worms.

354
00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:01.929
I don't think I have worms.

355
00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:03.806
This just how I am.

356
00:28:03.973 --> 00:28:06.475
- Did you take your pills today?
- No, ma'am.

357
00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:08.894
Come. Let's get a cold root beer.

358
00:28:09.062 --> 00:28:11.146
I found the medication under your pillow.

359
00:28:11.314 --> 00:28:14.191
I'm not "asposed" to. It's dangerous.

360
00:28:14.609 --> 00:28:17.945
Who said that? Come on, little man.

361
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.614
Hello, children.

362
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:33.210
Whoa, hold, please!

363
00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:40.759
Then I'm in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

364
00:28:40.927 --> 00:28:45.097
Three thousand people show up
my first day.

365
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:46.932
Look.

366
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.561
What's it like living in a cage?

367
00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:52.479
It stinks.

368
00:28:52.647 --> 00:28:55.482
But the monkeys...

369
00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.693
...they do some tricks there.

370
00:28:57.861 --> 00:29:01.071
I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali.

371
00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:03.574
She is orangutan.

372
00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:07.119
When I'm not playing with the monkeys,
they want me to run to the bars...

373
00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:09.163
...in my cage, with my teeth.

374
00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:21.300
So then what'd you do?

375
00:29:21.468 --> 00:29:27.014
Then I leave zoo, go here, go there.
Wandered most of the time.

376
00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:29.183
You were all alone?

377
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.226
Plenty of time you'll be alone.

378
00:29:31.394 --> 00:29:34.772
When you're different like us,
it's gonna be that way.

379
00:29:37.901 --> 00:29:39.735
But I'll tell you a little secret.

380
00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:43.030
Fat people, skinny people, tall people...

381
00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:46.533
...white people,
they're just as alone as we are.

382
00:29:46.701 --> 00:29:49.745
But they're scared shitless.

383
00:29:55.168 --> 00:29:58.045
I think about the river I grew up on.

384
00:29:58.338 --> 00:30:01.840
It would be nice to sit by my river again.

385
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:06.386
Come, I have an appointment.

386
00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:10.599
There's my little man. You ready, sugar?

387
00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:14.895
Always ready. Always ready.
Heh, heh, heh.

388
00:30:15.063 --> 00:30:17.815
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

389
00:30:18.233 --> 00:30:21.026
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- My pleasure, ma'am.

390
00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:23.070
You can find your own way home,
can't you?

391
00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:25.781
Take the St. Charles line to Napoleon.

392
00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:34.665
Hey! Hey!

393
00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:58.522
Where in God's name have you been?
Get in here.

394
00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:02.276
I mean, you take my breath away,
you know that?

395
00:31:02.652 --> 00:31:06.196
Oh, Lord, I was so worried about you.

396
00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:10.784
It had been the best day of my life.

397
00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:15.038
- How's her breathing?
- It's shallow.

398
00:31:15.206 --> 00:31:17.124
They say it'll reach us in a few hours...

399
00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:19.793
...so I gotta get my baby
and take him to my sister's.

400
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:22.504
They say there's nothing
to worry about in the hospital.

401
00:31:22.672 --> 00:31:25.007
Nurses will be right here if you need them.
You okay?

402
00:31:25.174 --> 00:31:26.633
Yeah, um, I'm okay reading.

403
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:29.386
I shouldn't be more than an hour.

404
00:31:30.346 --> 00:31:33.098
Was there just company?

405
00:31:33.266 --> 00:31:35.934
It was just Dorothy leaving.

406
00:31:38.104 --> 00:31:39.438
Go on, Caroline.

407
00:31:39.606 --> 00:31:42.941
"On Sundays,
the families would come and visit."

408
00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:46.153
It was Thanksgiving, 1930.

409
00:31:46.321 --> 00:31:50.073
I met the person
who changed my life forever.

410
00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.503
Well, Benjamin.

411
00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:07.215
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

412
00:32:07.383 --> 00:32:08.800
Good day, Mrs. Fuller.

413
00:32:08.968 --> 00:32:12.179
A single cane, back straight as an arrow.

414
00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:14.598
What elixir have you been drinking?

415
00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.016
Thank you, ma'am.

416
00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:19.019
Grandma! Look at me!

417
00:32:20.813 --> 00:32:23.190
That was really something.

418
00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:24.650
Come on over here, you.

419
00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:28.612
Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy.

420
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.447
This is Mr...

421
00:32:30.907 --> 00:32:34.743
I'm afraid, Benjamin,
I don't rightly know your last name.

422
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:36.703
Benjamin's fine.

423
00:32:36.871 --> 00:32:39.164
I never forgot her blue eyes.

424
00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:42.417
Good people, supper is served.

425
00:32:42.585 --> 00:32:46.463
Health and food, true love and friends.

426
00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:49.967
For everything thy goodness sends.
Amen.

427
00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:51.426
Amen.

428
00:32:53.554 --> 00:32:54.930
That looks good.

429
00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:57.099
Did you know turkeys aren't really birds?

430
00:32:57.892 --> 00:32:58.934
Why do you say that?

431
00:32:59.102 --> 00:33:01.812
They are in the pheasant family,
can't hardly fly.

432
00:33:02.105 --> 00:33:04.773
It's sad, don't you think?
Birds that can't fly?

433
00:33:04.941 --> 00:33:07.067
I love birds that can't fly.

434
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:10.237
They are so delicious.

435
00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:11.446
That's terrible.

436
00:33:11.614 --> 00:33:16.076
I have something to tell y'all while
we're giving thanks for God's blessings.

437
00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:22.040
I had a miracle happen.
The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.

438
00:33:25.044 --> 00:33:27.087
What does she mean,
answered her prayers?

439
00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:28.588
Thanks. Thank you.

440
00:33:28.756 --> 00:33:30.590
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

441
00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:35.470
That's what my mama said
when I was gonna have a baby brother...

442
00:33:35.638 --> 00:33:37.764
...but he didn't live long...

443
00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:41.351
...because he didn't breathe right.

444
00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:48.108
"...in the afternoon,
when he had got his beautiful hind legs...

445
00:33:48.276 --> 00:33:52.612
...just as Big God Nqong had promised.

446
00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.157
You can see that it's 5:00...

447
00:33:55.324 --> 00:33:58.910
...because Big God Nqong's
clock says so."

448
00:33:59.078 --> 00:34:01.413
Isn't that something?

449
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:04.291
- Again. Read it again.
- Oh, read it again, please.

450
00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:08.920
All right. But afterwards,
you must go to bed.

451
00:34:09.088 --> 00:34:11.131
I promise.

452
00:34:12.341 --> 00:34:14.134
"Old Man Kangaroo..."

453
00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:20.974
Are you sleeping?

454
00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:23.060
Who says that?

455
00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:24.561
It's me, Daisy.

456
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:27.814
Oh, hi.

457
00:34:27.982 --> 00:34:30.067
Okay, come on.

458
00:34:41.287 --> 00:34:43.246
Where are we going?

459
00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:44.664
Come on.

460
00:34:44.832 --> 00:34:47.042
Under here.

461
00:34:56.052 --> 00:34:57.344
Here, you light it.

462
00:34:57.512 --> 00:34:59.471
I'm not supposed to play with matches.

463
00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:03.016
Don't be a chicken. Light it.

464
00:35:12.985 --> 00:35:15.904
I'll tell you a secret if you'll tell me one.

465
00:35:16.072 --> 00:35:17.364
Okay.

466
00:35:17.532 --> 00:35:21.159
I saw my mama kissing another man.

467
00:35:21.327 --> 00:35:24.162
Her face was red from it.

468
00:35:25.706 --> 00:35:27.040
Your turn.

469
00:35:27.875 --> 00:35:29.209
Uh...

470
00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:31.962
I'm not as old as I look.

471
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.132
I thought so.

472
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:39.302
You don't--
You don't seem like an old person.

473
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:42.139
- Like my grandma.
- I'm not.

474
00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:45.058
Are you sick?

475
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.603
Well, I heard Mama and Tizzy whispering.

476
00:35:48.771 --> 00:35:51.857
They said I was gonna die soon, but...

477
00:35:52.024 --> 00:35:53.692
...maybe not.

478
00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:57.404
You're odd.

479
00:35:57.572 --> 00:36:00.157
You're different than anybody
I've ever met.

480
00:36:03.786 --> 00:36:05.036
May I?

481
00:36:05.204 --> 00:36:06.746
Okay.

482
00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.588
What are you doing under there?

483
00:36:15.423 --> 00:36:18.800
You come right out here
and get back up to bed.

484
00:36:18.968 --> 00:36:20.802
It's after midnight!

485
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.929
You are not to be playing together.

486
00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:24.306
Yes, ma'am.

487
00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:26.850
Now you get back to bed, little lady.

488
00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:31.605
You're too young to be wandering around
in the night on your own.

489
00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:38.737
And you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

490
00:36:52.793 --> 00:36:55.545
You are a different child.

491
00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:57.505
A man child.

492
00:36:57.673 --> 00:37:01.426
And, baby, people aren't gonna understand
just how different you are.

493
00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:10.602
What's wrong with me, Mama?

494
00:37:10.811 --> 00:37:12.646
Come here.

495
00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:18.068
God hasn't said yet, baby.

496
00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:25.867
Now go on to bed, hear?
And behave yourself.

497
00:37:26.327 --> 00:37:29.663
Go on. Say your prayers, hear?

498
00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:44.928
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

499
00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:49.349
Once when I was repairing a leak
on the roof.

500
00:37:54.021 --> 00:37:56.523
Once I was just crossing the road
to get the mail.

501
00:38:13.374 --> 00:38:14.791
I never forgot her...

502
00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:16.543
"...blue eyes."

503
00:38:18.004 --> 00:38:19.212
Mom?

504
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:24.092
Did you get that this Benjamin loved you
from the first time that he saw you?

505
00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:27.846
- Mm-hm.
- Not many people experience that.

506
00:38:29.348 --> 00:38:31.516
- Want me to go on?
- Hm.

507
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.936
He crosses something out.

508
00:38:35.104 --> 00:38:36.771
When that baby came...

509
00:38:37.064 --> 00:38:38.940
...things were different.

510
00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:50.577
Babies were born, people died.

511
00:38:50.911 --> 00:38:52.579
A lot of folks been through
that old house.

512
00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:58.543
I've come to say goodbye.
I'm going away.

513
00:38:58.919 --> 00:39:00.462
Going?

514
00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:02.172
Where?

515
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.882
I haven't figured that out yet...

516
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:06.384
...but I'll send you a postcard
when I get there.

517
00:39:06.552 --> 00:39:09.262
What about your friend, the tall lady?

518
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:10.680
We are not friends any more.

519
00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:13.099
That's what happens with
tall people sometimes.

520
00:39:14.393 --> 00:39:15.935
Well...

521
00:39:16.437 --> 00:39:18.104
...goodbye.

522
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:39.459
Spent a lot of time by myself that year.

523
00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:42.379
Hello?

524
00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:45.298
- Hi.
- I'm moving in today.

525
00:39:45.466 --> 00:39:47.801
Welcome. We've been expecting you.

526
00:39:47.968 --> 00:39:51.304
Can you please show her up
to Mrs. Rousseau's old room?

527
00:39:51.472 --> 00:39:54.808
I'm sorry, but we usually don't
allow dogs in the house.

528
00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:57.977
Well, she's old as the hills.
She's almost blind.

529
00:39:58.145 --> 00:40:00.814
She won't be a bother much longer.

530
00:40:00.981 --> 00:40:04.859
Well, all right,
long as she stays from up underfoot.

531
00:40:05.027 --> 00:40:06.277
Right this way, ma'am.

532
00:40:06.487 --> 00:40:09.656
As hard as I try,
I can't remember her name.

533
00:40:09.824 --> 00:40:13.493
Mrs. Lawson or Mrs. Hartford.

534
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:15.078
Maybe it was Maple.

535
00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:17.997
It's funny how sometimes the people
we remember the least...

536
00:40:18.165 --> 00:40:20.125
...make the greatest impression on us.

537
00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:23.253
I do remember she wore diamonds.

538
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:26.589
And she always dressed in fine clothing,
as if she was going out.

539
00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:31.010
Although she never did
and nobody ever came to visit her.

540
00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:34.639
She taught me to play the piano.

541
00:40:40.354 --> 00:40:43.606
It's not about how well you play.

542
00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:46.401
It's how you feel about
what you're playing.

543
00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:48.486
Try this.

544
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.839
You can't help putting yourself
in the music.

545
00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:21.728
There were many changes.
Some you could see, some you couldn't.

546
00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:24.731
Hair had started growing
in all sorts of places...

547
00:41:25.357 --> 00:41:27.901
...along with other things.

548
00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:32.280
I felt pretty good, considering.

549
00:41:32.573 --> 00:41:34.908
Darling, the pain.

550
00:41:35.075 --> 00:41:37.410
All right, Mom. I'll get the nurse.

551
00:41:40.247 --> 00:41:43.374
Look at this eye.
This is a major hurricane.

552
00:41:43.584 --> 00:41:46.002
A slow hurricane,
with maximum sustained winds of...

553
00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.837
Not doing too good?

554
00:41:48.797 --> 00:41:51.424
Nobody seems to know whether
to stay or leave.

555
00:41:52.218 --> 00:41:53.885
I'm gonna ride it out.

556
00:41:54.595 --> 00:41:58.640
There. That should make things
much easier.

557
00:42:00.809 --> 00:42:03.686
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

558
00:42:04.063 --> 00:42:07.565
My father waited four hours for my brother
to get here from Boger City.

559
00:42:07.733 --> 00:42:09.442
Couldn't go without him.

560
00:42:10.277 --> 00:42:12.153
She seems like a sweet woman.

561
00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:15.114
Yeah. I haven't had as much time with her
as I would've--

562
00:42:15.282 --> 00:42:17.367
- You busy? I could use your help.
- Excuse me.

563
00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:19.077
Sure.

564
00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:39.597
"Queenie would let me go
with Mr. Daws..."

565
00:42:39.765 --> 00:42:42.850
...to Poverty Point to watch
the boats go up and down the river.

566
00:42:43.018 --> 00:42:45.687
These were hard times.

567
00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:52.485
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

568
00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:55.655
Once when I was in the field
just tending to my cows.

569
00:43:02.496 --> 00:43:05.206
My fourth hand didn't show up.

570
00:43:07.042 --> 00:43:11.504
Anybody wanna make $2
for a day's work around here?

571
00:43:12.339 --> 00:43:15.842
What's the matter? Nobody wants to do
an honest day's work...

572
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.011
- ...for an honest day's pay?
- He never pays.

573
00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:21.514
Nobody wants a job?

574
00:43:21.682 --> 00:43:23.224
I do.

575
00:43:23.851 --> 00:43:25.935
You got your sea legs about you,
old man?

576
00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:27.729
Mm-hm.

577
00:43:27.896 --> 00:43:29.689
I think.

578
00:43:33.235 --> 00:43:35.486
Well, that's good enough for me.

579
00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:39.866
Get your ass on board.
We'll sure as hell find out.

580
00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:46.247
I was as happy as I could be.

581
00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:47.707
I need a volunteer!

582
00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:49.083
I would do anything.

583
00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:50.627
Yes, captain!

584
00:43:50.836 --> 00:43:53.630
Scrape off all this bird shit!

585
00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:55.506
Right away, sir.

586
00:43:56.467 --> 00:44:00.803
And I was actually gonna be paid
for something I would've done for free.

587
00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:06.059
His name was Captain Mike Clark.

588
00:44:06.226 --> 00:44:09.395
He'd been on a tugboat since he was 7.

589
00:44:09.563 --> 00:44:11.022
Get moving on that.

590
00:44:12.566 --> 00:44:14.150
Come here.

591
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.697
Can you, uh, still get it up?

592
00:44:20.574 --> 00:44:22.533
I do every morning.

593
00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:26.579
The old pole, huh? The high, hard one?

594
00:44:27.247 --> 00:44:28.539
I guess.

595
00:44:31.168 --> 00:44:33.670
When was the last time
you had a woman?

596
00:44:36.256 --> 00:44:38.716
- Never.
- Never?

597
00:44:38.884 --> 00:44:41.094
Not that I know of, sir.

598
00:44:41.261 --> 00:44:43.262
Wait a minute, now.

599
00:44:43.972 --> 00:44:47.934
You mean to say you've been on this earth
however many years...

600
00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:51.229
...and you've never had a woman?

601
00:44:52.147 --> 00:44:53.648
Mm-mm.

602
00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:59.862
Damn, that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

603
00:45:00.572 --> 00:45:01.906
Never?

604
00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:03.991
No.

605
00:45:06.328 --> 00:45:11.416
Then, by Jesus, you are coming with me.

606
00:45:21.343 --> 00:45:23.010
What did your father do?

607
00:45:23.178 --> 00:45:25.179
I never met my father.

608
00:45:25.347 --> 00:45:27.807
You lucky bastard.

609
00:45:27.975 --> 00:45:31.394
All fathers wanna do is hold you down.

610
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.858
Out on my father's boat,
working the two-a-day...

611
00:45:37.025 --> 00:45:39.861
...this little fat bastard...

612
00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.446
...Tug Irish, they calls him.

613
00:45:41.613 --> 00:45:45.491
Anyway, I finally works up the nerve
and tell him:

614
00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:49.495
"I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
on a goddamn tugboat."

615
00:45:49.663 --> 00:45:51.164
You know what I'm saying?

616
00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:54.584
You don't wanna spend
the rest of your life on a tugboat.

617
00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:58.129
Absolutely! Damn right!

618
00:45:59.673 --> 00:46:02.508
So you know what my father says to me?

619
00:46:03.177 --> 00:46:07.513
He says,
"Who the hell do you think you are?

620
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:10.558
What the hell do you think you can do?"

621
00:46:10.726 --> 00:46:12.769
So I tell him.

622
00:46:13.061 --> 00:46:17.148
"Well, if you're asking...

623
00:46:18.692 --> 00:46:19.984
...I wanna be an artist."

624
00:46:21.153 --> 00:46:22.987
He laughs.

625
00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:24.906
"An artist?

626
00:46:25.073 --> 00:46:28.367
God meant for you to work a tugboat,
just like me.

627
00:46:28.535 --> 00:46:30.661
And that's exactly what
you're gonna do."

628
00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:34.373
Well, I turned myself into an artist.

629
00:46:37.085 --> 00:46:38.419
A tattoo artist!

630
00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:45.051
I put on every one of these myself.

631
00:46:46.595 --> 00:46:50.890
You have to skin me alive
to take my art away from me now.

632
00:46:51.266 --> 00:46:55.061
When I'm dead,
I'm gonna send him my arm.

633
00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:58.064
That one.

634
00:46:59.733 --> 00:47:02.318
Don't let anyone tell you different.

635
00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:04.737
You gotta do what you're meant to do.

636
00:47:04.905 --> 00:47:08.616
And I happen to be a goddamned artist.

637
00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:10.868
But you're a tugboat captain.

638
00:47:11.787 --> 00:47:13.454
Captain Mike?

639
00:47:13.622 --> 00:47:16.916
We're ready for you and your friend.

640
00:47:18.085 --> 00:47:21.587
Let's go, old-timer. Break your cherry.

641
00:47:22.297 --> 00:47:23.923
Hello, my lovelies.

642
00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:26.884
- Hey, captain.
- Hi, Mike.

643
00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:29.595
- Hi.
- Hi.

644
00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:31.931
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

645
00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:35.685
How are you tonight, grandpa?

646
00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.856
It was a night to remember.

647
00:47:45.112 --> 00:47:49.699
What are you, Dick Tracy or something?
I've got to rest.

648
00:47:50.075 --> 00:47:51.576
Again.

649
00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:54.787
- Thank you.
- No, thank you. You have a nice night.

650
00:47:54.955 --> 00:47:57.373
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- Every night but Sunday.

651
00:47:57.541 --> 00:48:00.543
It sure made me understand the value
of earning a living.

652
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:03.337
Good night, sweetie. Come back now.

653
00:48:03.505 --> 00:48:05.965
Things money can buy you.

654
00:48:23.483 --> 00:48:25.067
It's nasty out.

655
00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:28.404
Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

656
00:48:30.407 --> 00:48:31.991
That's awfully kind of you, sir.

657
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:44.837
My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

658
00:48:45.005 --> 00:48:48.090
- I'm Benjamin.
- Benjamin.

659
00:48:48.258 --> 00:48:50.509
It's a pleasure to know you.

660
00:48:52.054 --> 00:48:55.097
Would you like to stop somewhere
and have a drink?

661
00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:56.307
All right.

662
00:48:58.101 --> 00:49:00.061
Evening, Mr. Button.

663
00:49:04.858 --> 00:49:06.859
What'll it be, sir?

664
00:49:07.569 --> 00:49:09.153
I'll have whatever he's having.

665
00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:12.657
Sazerac for both of us.
With whiskey, not brandy.

666
00:49:13.158 --> 00:49:14.533
You don't drink, do you?

667
00:49:14.701 --> 00:49:17.328
- It's a night for firsts.
- How's that?

668
00:49:17.496 --> 00:49:20.331
I never been to a brothel, either.

669
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:23.876
- It's an experience.
- Certainly is.

670
00:49:24.044 --> 00:49:27.004
- There's a time for everything.
- True enough.

671
00:49:27.172 --> 00:49:28.881
Your drinks.

672
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.218
I don't mean to be rude, but, uh...

673
00:49:32.386 --> 00:49:34.887
...your hands. Is that painful?

674
00:49:35.347 --> 00:49:37.932
Well, I was born
with some form of disease.

675
00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:39.558
What kind of disease?

676
00:49:39.726 --> 00:49:41.894
I was born old.

677
00:49:43.021 --> 00:49:44.480
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.

678
00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:46.649
There's nothing wrong with old age.

679
00:49:56.243 --> 00:50:00.246
My wife passed away many years ago.

680
00:50:00.622 --> 00:50:03.582
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

681
00:50:03.917 --> 00:50:06.502
She died in childbirth.

682
00:50:09.297 --> 00:50:10.548
To children.

683
00:50:10.716 --> 00:50:12.216
To mothers.

684
00:50:17.055 --> 00:50:18.889
What line of work you in, Mr. Button?

685
00:50:19.057 --> 00:50:23.936
Buttons. Button's Buttons.
There isn't a button that we don't make.

686
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.859
Our biggest competition is B. F. Goodrich
and his infernal zippers.

687
00:50:30.027 --> 00:50:31.861
Would you gentlemen like anything else?

688
00:50:32.738 --> 00:50:34.655
One for the road, Benjamin?

689
00:50:34.823 --> 00:50:38.576
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button.

690
00:50:38.952 --> 00:50:42.288
So, what line of work do you do?

691
00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:45.499
I'm a tugboat man.

692
00:50:51.465 --> 00:50:53.716
I enjoyed talking to you.

693
00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:56.677
I enjoyed drinking with you.

694
00:50:59.639 --> 00:51:01.265
Benjamin?

695
00:51:01.433 --> 00:51:04.643
Would you mind if, time to time,
I stopped by and said hello?

696
00:51:04.811 --> 00:51:08.147
Any time. Good night, Mr. Button.

697
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:10.900
Good night, Benjamin.

698
00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:12.485
Drive on.

699
00:51:18.158 --> 00:51:19.575
Where have you been?

700
00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:23.079
Nothing. I met some people...

701
00:51:23.288 --> 00:51:24.830
...listened to some music.

702
00:51:28.335 --> 00:51:29.460
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

703
00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:34.340
Growing up's a funny thing.
Sneaks up on you.

704
00:51:34.508 --> 00:51:39.095
One person is there, then suddenly
somebody else has taken her place.

705
00:51:39.346 --> 00:51:41.222
She wasn't all elbows and knees any more.

706
00:51:41.389 --> 00:51:43.182
Benjamin. Come on.

707
00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:45.101
Okay.

708
00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:50.397
I loved those weekends when she'd come
and spend the night with her grandmother.

709
00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:00.074
Daisy.

710
00:52:00.242 --> 00:52:02.159
Daisy.

711
00:52:02.327 --> 00:52:04.078
You wanna see something?

712
00:52:05.539 --> 00:52:07.373
You gotta keep it a secret.

713
00:52:07.541 --> 00:52:11.627
So get dressed. I'll meet you out back.

714
00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:17.550
Shh. Come on.

715
00:52:18.927 --> 00:52:20.177
Can you swim?

716
00:52:20.345 --> 00:52:21.887
I can do anything you can do.

717
00:52:22.055 --> 00:52:24.390
Here, put this on. We gotta hurry.

718
00:52:37.737 --> 00:52:39.405
Is he okay?

719
00:52:39.573 --> 00:52:41.157
Captain?

720
00:52:42.534 --> 00:52:44.451
Captain Mike?

721
00:52:47.706 --> 00:52:50.499
Morning, captain. Can you take us out?

722
00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:53.711
Do you know what day it is?

723
00:52:53.879 --> 00:52:55.087
Sunday?

724
00:52:55.255 --> 00:52:56.589
Do you know what that means?

725
00:52:58.633 --> 00:53:01.677
Means I was very drunk last night.

726
00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.429
Well, you're drunk every night.

727
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:07.766
Is that a girl?

728
00:53:07.934 --> 00:53:10.811
Close friend. I wanna show her the river.

729
00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:14.940
You're not supposed
to go joyriding with civilians.

730
00:53:15.275 --> 00:53:18.110
I could lose my license.

731
00:53:27.204 --> 00:53:28.954
What are you waiting for?

732
00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:02.947
Pulled in for repair. A wounded duck.

733
00:54:03.448 --> 00:54:05.366
She's flying now, huh?

734
00:54:06.159 --> 00:54:08.118
Ahoy, sailor!

735
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:15.042
I wish we could go with them.

736
00:54:20.507 --> 00:54:22.841
Did you say something, Mom?

737
00:54:31.017 --> 00:54:33.435
It's getting really bad.

738
00:54:34.479 --> 00:54:36.939
Can you hear me, Mom?

739
00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:38.857
- Mm.
- Huh?

740
00:54:39.025 --> 00:54:42.695
Time just seeped out of me.

741
00:54:48.493 --> 00:54:50.244
"Things were changing quickly."

742
00:54:50.495 --> 00:54:54.623
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

743
00:54:56.042 --> 00:54:59.044
What if I told you
that I wasn't getting older...

744
00:54:59.212 --> 00:55:02.381
...but I was getting younger
than everybody else?

745
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:04.091
Well...

746
00:55:04.259 --> 00:55:06.385
...I'd feel sorry for you...

747
00:55:06.553 --> 00:55:09.221
...to have to see everybody you love
die before you do.

748
00:55:09.389 --> 00:55:11.265
It's an awful responsibility.

749
00:55:11.433 --> 00:55:14.977
I'd never thought about
life or death that way before.

750
00:55:16.688 --> 00:55:20.691
Benjamin, we're meant
to lose the people we love.

751
00:55:21.234 --> 00:55:24.320
How else would we know
how important they are to us?

752
00:55:27.741 --> 00:55:33.245
And one fall day, a familiar visitor
came knocking on our door.

753
00:55:33.913 --> 00:55:36.707
You wanna go with me to the drugstore?

754
00:55:46.926 --> 00:55:49.094
She taught me how to play the piano...

755
00:55:49.262 --> 00:55:50.554
Amen.

756
00:55:50.722 --> 00:55:54.350
...and she taught me what it meant
to miss somebody.

757
00:55:58.521 --> 00:55:59.813
Let's go.

758
00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:02.691
I had gone to a brothel.

759
00:56:03.068 --> 00:56:05.194
I'd had my first drink.

760
00:56:05.403 --> 00:56:06.904
Said goodbye to one friend...

761
00:56:07.614 --> 00:56:09.198
...and buried another.

762
00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:13.577
In 1936, when I was coming to the end
of the 17th year of my life...

763
00:56:14.454 --> 00:56:17.122
...I packed my bag, I said goodbye.

764
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:19.458
- Bye, Benjamin.
- Goodbye.

765
00:56:19.626 --> 00:56:24.588
I knew, life being what it was,
I'd probably never see them again.

766
00:56:26.466 --> 00:56:28.384
Bye, Mr. Benjamin.

767
00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:31.136
- Good luck to you, son.
- Thank you.

768
00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:38.102
- I love you, Mama.
- Oh, I love you too, baby.

769
00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:42.773
I want you to say your prayers
every night, hear?

770
00:56:47.445 --> 00:56:49.154
Be safe, hear?

771
00:57:00.834 --> 00:57:02.668
Benjamin!

772
00:57:05.296 --> 00:57:06.505
Where you going?

773
00:57:06.673 --> 00:57:08.006
Oh, to sea.

774
00:57:09.342 --> 00:57:12.177
I'll send you a postcard.

775
00:57:13.138 --> 00:57:15.139
From everywhere.

776
00:57:15.306 --> 00:57:18.225
Write me a postcard from everywhere.

777
00:57:32.532 --> 00:57:33.866
Can you imagine?

778
00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:39.538
He sent me a postcard...

779
00:57:39.706 --> 00:57:43.959
...from everywhere he went.

780
00:57:44.335 --> 00:57:47.212
Every place he worked.

781
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:51.091
Newfoundland. Baffin Bay.

782
00:57:51.259 --> 00:57:54.887
Glasgow. Liverpool. Narvik.

783
00:57:55.054 --> 00:58:00.225
He had gone with that Captain Mike.

784
00:58:01.936 --> 00:58:04.229
Captain Mike had contracted
for three years...

785
00:58:04.397 --> 00:58:06.398
...with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage.

786
00:58:06.566 --> 00:58:10.569
The old ship had been refitted
with a diesel engine and a new sea winch.

787
00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:13.197
We went around Florida
and up the Atlantic seaboard.

788
00:58:13.573 --> 00:58:17.910
We were a crew of seven now:
Captain Mike and me, the Cookie...

789
00:58:18.077 --> 00:58:20.621
...Prentiss Mayes
from Wilmington, Delaware...

790
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.664
...the Brody twins, Rick and Vic...

791
00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:25.250
...who got along fine at sea,
but for some reason...

792
00:58:25.418 --> 00:58:28.670
...once they were on dry landt
couldn't stand the sight of each other.

793
00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:32.007
You know, one in every eight boats
never returns.

794
00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:34.426
There was John Grimm,
who sure fit his name...

795
00:58:34.594 --> 00:58:36.220
All hands lost at sea.

796
00:58:36.387 --> 00:58:38.013
...from Belvedere, South Dakota.

797
00:58:40.391 --> 00:58:42.809
And Pleasant Curtis
from Asheville, Notch.

798
00:58:42.977 --> 00:58:47.231
Never said a word to anyonet
except himself.

799
00:58:48.733 --> 00:58:51.652
I wrote him constantly.

800
00:58:52.779 --> 00:58:58.116
I told him I had been invited
to audition in New York City...

801
00:58:58.284 --> 00:59:00.953
...for the School of American Ballet.

802
00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.412
Please stay.

803
00:59:02.956 --> 00:59:05.666
Thank you. Thank you.

804
00:59:07.168 --> 00:59:08.293
You can stay.

805
00:59:10.713 --> 00:59:13.590
But I was relegated to the corps.

806
00:59:14.092 --> 00:59:17.427
Another dancing gypsy.

807
00:59:20.807 --> 00:59:22.599
Benjamin!

808
00:59:22.767 --> 00:59:25.185
How is it when you showed up...

809
00:59:25.353 --> 00:59:29.189
...you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave?

810
00:59:29.357 --> 00:59:34.528
Now, either I drink a hell of a lot more
than I think I do...

811
00:59:34.696 --> 00:59:37.197
...or you sprouted.

812
00:59:37.365 --> 00:59:39.533
What's your secret?

813
00:59:40.618 --> 00:59:42.828
Well, captain...

814
00:59:43.997 --> 00:59:46.248
...you do drink a lot.

815
00:59:50.545 --> 00:59:54.673
We stayed in a small hotel
with a grand name, the Winter Palace.

816
00:59:54.841 --> 00:59:57.551
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

817
00:59:57.719 --> 01:00:01.763
The hummingbird is not just another bird.

818
01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:05.559
Its heart rate's 1200 beats per minute.

819
01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:10.897
Its wings beat 80 times a second.

820
01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:17.362
If you was to stop their wings from beating,
it would be dead in less than 10 seconds.

821
01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:22.701
This is no ordinary bird.

822
01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:26.038
This is a freaking miracle.

823
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:32.628
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures...

824
01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:35.380
...and you know what they saw?

825
01:00:35.548 --> 01:00:39.426
Their wingtips are doing that:

826
01:00:42.513 --> 01:00:46.350
You know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for?

827
01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:50.604
Infinity.

828
01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:52.564
Infinity!

829
01:00:55.777 --> 01:00:58.445
Everybody, no matter
what differences they had...

830
01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:00.739
...the languagest the color of their skin...

831
01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:02.866
...had one thing in common:

832
01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:05.702
They were drunk every single night.

833
01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.371
Three, please.

834
01:01:07.538 --> 01:01:09.247
Could you hold, dear, for us, please?

835
01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.541
Thank you very much. Good evening.

836
01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:14.252
Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.

837
01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:17.589
She was not beautiful.
She was plain as paper.

838
01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:20.175
But she was pretty as any picture to me.

839
01:01:21.969 --> 01:01:23.887
What are you looking at?

840
01:01:26.557 --> 01:01:30.102
If you must know, we have a longstanding
agreement never to go to bed sober.

841
01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:32.813
- Isn't that right, darling?
- Whatever you say, darling.

842
01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:35.065
Her husband was Walter Abbott.

843
01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:38.944
He was chief minister
of the British Trade Mission in Murmansk...

844
01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:40.737
...and he was a spy.

845
01:01:40.905 --> 01:01:43.490
- Darling.
- Oh, thank you, my darling.

846
01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:46.284
- Key, darling.
- Oh, yes.

847
01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:50.622
I, uh...

848
01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.958
I broke my heel off one of my shoes.

849
01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:57.629
I'm not in the habit of walking about
in my stocking feet.

850
01:02:01.467 --> 01:02:04.136
They were long days there.

851
01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:13.812
And even longer nights.

852
01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:19.860
One particular night,
I was having trouble sleeping.

853
01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:22.404
I'm sorry.

854
01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.490
I couldn't sleep.

855
01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:41.465
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

856
01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.009
Oh, no. Thank you.

857
01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:24.049
Milk, honey?

858
01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:26.635
A bit of honey, please.

859
01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:28.804
I hope you like flies in your honey.

860
01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:31.223
Oh, perhaps not.

861
01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:50.408
Oh, maybe, um, better to let it
steep a little.

862
01:03:50.576 --> 01:03:53.411
- Steep?
- Um, soak.

863
01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:57.040
I don't know, I mean,
there's a proper way of making tea.

864
01:03:57.208 --> 01:04:00.752
Well, where I'm from,
people just want it to be hot.

865
01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.421
Well, quite right.

866
01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:14.182
- Now, you're a seaman--
- A sailor.

867
01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:16.935
I hope you won't think me impolite,
but I have to ask...

868
01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:19.437
...aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

869
01:04:19.605 --> 01:04:22.232
There's no age limit.
As long as you can do the work.

870
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.733
Oh.

871
01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:35.579
And you have trouble sleeping?
Thank you.

872
01:04:35.746 --> 01:04:39.291
I didn't think I did.
I usually sleep like a baby.

873
01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:42.502
Something's been keeping me up.

874
01:04:43.754 --> 01:04:48.800
My father in his 80s, he was so convinced
he was gonna die in his sleep...

875
01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:52.178
...he limited himself
to having afternoon naps.

876
01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:56.433
He was so determined
he was gonna cheat death.

877
01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:58.894
- Did he?
- Did he what?

878
01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:00.812
Die in his sleep?

879
01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:04.649
He died, um, sitting in his favourite chair...

880
01:05:04.817 --> 01:05:07.360
...listening to his favourite program
on the wireless.

881
01:05:07.528 --> 01:05:09.112
He must have known something.

882
01:05:15.786 --> 01:05:21.082
My husband's the British trade minister
and we've been here for 14 months.

883
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:24.336
- Good God.
- He were supposed to go to Peking...

884
01:05:24.503 --> 01:05:27.964
...but, um, it never seemed to work out.

885
01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:31.217
Have you been in the Far East?

886
01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.261
No. I've never been anywhere, really.

887
01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:35.805
I mean, outside of harbors.

888
01:05:35.973 --> 01:05:37.891
And where is it that you're from?

889
01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.477
New Orleans. Louisiana.

890
01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:43.772
I didn't know there was another.

891
01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:52.113
And she told me about all the places
she had beent and what she had seen.

892
01:05:52.865 --> 01:05:56.451
And we talked till just before the dawn.

893
01:05:58.496 --> 01:06:01.706
And we went back to our rooms...

894
01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:04.501
...to our separate lives.

895
01:06:09.006 --> 01:06:12.717
But every night,
we'd meet again in that lobby.

896
01:06:17.598 --> 01:06:22.018
A hotel in the middle of the night
can be a magical place.

897
01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:28.066
A mouse running and stopping.

898
01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:31.069
A radiator hissing.

899
01:06:31.737 --> 01:06:33.947
A curtain blowing.

900
01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:40.787
There's something peaceful,
even comforting...

901
01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:44.082
...knowing that the people you love
are asleep in their beds...

902
01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.793
...where nothing can harm them.

903
01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:52.716
Elizabeth and I
would lose track of the night...

904
01:06:52.925 --> 01:06:54.759
...until just before daybreak.

905
01:06:57.596 --> 01:07:00.390
I think I may have given you
the wrong impression.

906
01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:02.183
Beg your pardon?

907
01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:05.228
Well, married women
don't customarily sit around...

908
01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:08.106
...in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

909
01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:11.776
I wouldn't know what a married woman
does or doesn't do.

910
01:07:17.616 --> 01:07:19.367
Good night.

911
01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:22.871
Murmansk.

912
01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:28.460
"I've met somebody,
and I've fallen in love."

913
01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:30.003
Mom?

914
01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:36.551
That was over 60 years ago.

915
01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:38.803
Did you love him, Mother?

916
01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:41.431
What does a girl know about love?

917
01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:16.800
Well...

918
01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:19.844
...I'm not dressed.

919
01:08:20.012 --> 01:08:23.306
Oh, you look splendid, just as you are.

920
01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:28.269
Don't waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in Murmansk...

921
01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:32.315
...because they're really
completely ordinary...

922
01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:35.860
...but the caviar and the vodka...

923
01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:41.825
...are sublime and plentiful.

924
01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:46.329
So...

925
01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.752
Savor it.

926
01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.214
- Mmm.
- And don't eat it all at once.

927
01:08:56.382 --> 01:08:59.717
Because that way,
there's nothing left to enjoy.

928
01:09:01.178 --> 01:09:06.391
And now take a little swallow of vodka
while it's still in your mouth.

929
01:09:20.489 --> 01:09:23.158
You haven't been with many women,
have you?

930
01:09:24.535 --> 01:09:26.828
Not on Sundays.

931
01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.206
And you've never had caviar before,
have you?

932
01:09:30.374 --> 01:09:32.041
No, ma'am.

933
01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.757
When I was 19...

934
01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:41.718
...I, uh...

935
01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:47.432
...I attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the English Channel.

936
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.641
Really?

937
01:09:48.809 --> 01:09:52.645
But the current that day
was so strong that...

938
01:09:52.813 --> 01:09:56.274
...for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

939
01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:59.777
I was in the water for 32 hours.

940
01:09:59.945 --> 01:10:03.740
And when I was two miles from Calais...

941
01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:07.118
...it started to rain.

942
01:10:07.661 --> 01:10:09.621
That's it! Steady on!

943
01:10:09.788 --> 01:10:12.790
And when I couldn't go any further...

944
01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:15.251
...I stopped.

945
01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.922
I just stopped.

946
01:10:19.089 --> 01:10:20.381
And everybody asked me...

947
01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:24.135
...would I try again?

948
01:10:24.845 --> 01:10:27.055
For why wouldn't I?

949
01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.642
But I never did.

950
01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:36.481
As a matter of fact, I've never done
anything with my life after that.

951
01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:42.820
Your hands are so coarse.

952
01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:56.668
I can feel the wind in your cheek.

953
01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.176
I'm afraid it's the witching hour.

954
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.852
It was the first time a woman
had ever kissed me.

955
01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.689
It's something you never forget.

956
01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:28.449
Cheers.

957
01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:29.867
I think you make me feel younger.

958
01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:32.453
You make me feel years younger too.

959
01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.289
I wish I was.

960
01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:37.834
So many things I'd change.

961
01:11:38.168 --> 01:11:40.378
I'd undo all my mistakes.

962
01:11:40.546 --> 01:11:42.797
What mistakes?

963
01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:48.303
I kept waiting, you know?

964
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:54.058
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

965
01:11:54.226 --> 01:11:56.227
Do something.

966
01:11:57.688 --> 01:12:01.107
Such an awful waste.
You never get it back.

967
01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:03.318
Wasted time.

968
01:12:09.074 --> 01:12:11.409
If we're going to have an affair...

969
01:12:12.202 --> 01:12:14.829
...you're never to look at me
during the day.

970
01:12:15.622 --> 01:12:19.083
And we're always to part before sunrise.

971
01:12:19.251 --> 01:12:22.211
And we will never say, "I love you."

972
01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:25.089
Those are the rules.

973
01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:30.345
- Are you cold?
- I'm freezing.

974
01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:31.971
Oh, you! Oh, you're frozen.

975
01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:35.350
What an idiot, I'm standing here in this fur.
How thoughtless of me.

976
01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:12.095
She was the first woman
that ever loved me.

977
01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:16.057
You want me to skip some?

978
01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:22.063
No, I'm glad he had somebody
to keep him warm.

979
01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:28.611
"I couldn't wait to see her again."

980
01:13:40.999 --> 01:13:43.751
We saw each other every night.

981
01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:45.920
We always used the same room.

982
01:13:48.173 --> 01:13:52.510
But each time seemed new and different.

983
01:13:53.011 --> 01:13:54.720
Come here.

984
01:14:01.645 --> 01:14:03.312
Elizabeth.

985
01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:06.649
Good night.

986
01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:10.987
Until one night...

987
01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:53.196
Yesterdayt December 7th, 1941...

988
01:14:53.363 --> 01:14:56.240
...a date which will live in infamy...

989
01:14:56.408 --> 01:15:01.412
It's a meeting, a policy meeting
regarding your future...

990
01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.831
...possibly beyond.

991
01:15:04.708 --> 01:15:07.084
There's been a change of plan, lads.

992
01:15:07.252 --> 01:15:08.753
As you may or may not know...

993
01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:12.256
...the Japs bombed Pearl Harbor
yesterday.

994
01:15:13.091 --> 01:15:16.177
Frank D. Roosevelt's asked each of us
to do our part.

995
01:15:16.803 --> 01:15:20.556
The Chelsea's been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.

996
01:15:21.558 --> 01:15:25.770
To repair, to salvage, and to rescue.

997
01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:30.608
Anybody doesn't wanna go to war,
now is the time to say so.

998
01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:34.779
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

999
01:15:38.283 --> 01:15:41.202
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk with you, Mike.

1000
01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:42.787
My wife's doing poorly.

1001
01:15:43.455 --> 01:15:46.958
I'd like to maybe see her one more time.

1002
01:15:48.126 --> 01:15:51.629
You're free to make your way home
any way you can, Mr. Mayes.

1003
01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.136
If he's leaving, who's gonna cook?

1004
01:15:59.304 --> 01:16:03.140
Food poisoning's one of the leading causes
of death at sea.

1005
01:16:03.308 --> 01:16:05.893
Right after inadequate safety equipment.

1006
01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:08.396
I can cook, captain.
Been doing it all my life.

1007
01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:12.733
I don't know.
You're a little moody for war, Benjamin.

1008
01:16:13.193 --> 01:16:14.819
What the hell?

1009
01:16:15.153 --> 01:16:19.198
I'll take any man wants to kick the shite out
of the Japs and the Huns.

1010
01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:25.621
That's it, pack your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen.

1011
01:16:31.503 --> 01:16:33.838
She had left a note.

1012
01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:37.133
She wrote,
"It was nice to have met you."

1013
01:16:38.176 --> 01:16:40.219
And that was it.

1014
01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:45.349
It wasn't the war any of us expected.

1015
01:16:46.226 --> 01:16:50.229
We would just tow crippled shipst
scraps of metal, really.

1016
01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:54.317
If there was a war, we didn't see it.

1017
01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.403
There was a man assigned to us.

1018
01:16:57.571 --> 01:17:01.616
The chief gunner loved the Navy.
But most of allt he loved America.

1019
01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:05.828
There is no other country
in the world. When you spell America...

1020
01:17:05.996 --> 01:17:08.831
His name was Dennis Smith
and he was a full-blooded Cherokee.

1021
01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:10.249
...you're spelling freedom.

1022
01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:13.252
His family had been Americans
for over 500 years.

1023
01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:15.421
These pacifists.

1024
01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:17.506
They say they won't fight on conscience.

1025
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:22.887
Where would we be if everybody decided
to act according to their conscience?

1026
01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:25.014
Keep it down, would you, chief?

1027
01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:43.574
Hey.

1028
01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:45.993
I've been watching you.

1029
01:17:46.536 --> 01:17:48.162
You seem trustworthy.

1030
01:17:50.415 --> 01:17:52.750
If something happens to me...

1031
01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.839
...could you see that this
gets to my wife?

1032
01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.634
He'd given me all of his pay.

1033
01:18:01.802 --> 01:18:04.428
Hadn't spent a dime of it.

1034
01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:08.349
I want my family
to know I was thinking about them.

1035
01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.480
All hands...

1036
01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:16.315
...on deck!

1037
01:18:17.984 --> 01:18:21.862
Get your asses up here,
you lazy bastards!

1038
01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:45.010
The war had finally found us.

1039
01:18:46.763 --> 01:18:49.724
All stop!

1040
01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.810
Pleasant, man that light.

1041
01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:04.655
A transport carrying 1300 men
had been split by a torpedo.

1042
01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:09.452
We were first to arrive at the scene.

1043
01:19:09.619 --> 01:19:10.995
Cut the engines!

1044
01:19:11.663 --> 01:19:14.498
All stop!

1045
01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:21.005
We were the only sound.

1046
01:19:34.394 --> 01:19:36.353
Fellas!

1047
01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.198
Sub!

1048
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.789
We sure as hell
can't outrun them fuckers.

1049
01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:58.709
Battle stations!

1050
01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:10.179
Thank you, chief.

1051
01:20:11.556 --> 01:20:12.890
What?

1052
01:20:25.612 --> 01:20:27.780
Is that the last one?

1053
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:50.529
Captain!

1054
01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:09.214
They shot the hell out of my painting.

1055
01:22:09.966 --> 01:22:12.259
Give me your hand.

1056
01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:19.224
You'll be all right, captain.

1057
01:22:19.392 --> 01:22:22.686
They got a nice spot in heaven
waiting for you. Nice spot.

1058
01:22:24.064 --> 01:22:27.274
You can be as mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1059
01:22:30.528 --> 01:22:32.196
You could swear...

1060
01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:34.740
...curse the Fates...

1061
01:22:36.034 --> 01:22:38.702
...but when it comes to the end...

1062
01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:43.040
...you have to let go.

1063
01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:51.215
Captain?

1064
01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:15.572
Thirteen-hundred and twenty-eight men
died that day.

1065
01:23:16.908 --> 01:23:20.911
I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee,
Dennis Smith...

1066
01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:25.249
...John Grimmt who was right,
he was gonna die there.

1067
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:29.128
I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money.

1068
01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:32.297
I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody...

1069
01:23:32.465 --> 01:23:38.345
...and to Mike Clarkt
captain of the tugboat Chelsea.

1070
01:23:39.597 --> 01:23:43.976
I said goodbye to all the other men
who had dreams of their own...

1071
01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:47.563
...all the men who wanted
to be insurance salesmen or doctors...

1072
01:23:47.731 --> 01:23:50.691
...or lawyers or Indian chiefs.

1073
01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:53.402
This don't get fixed.

1074
01:23:54.779 --> 01:23:58.824
Out heret death didn't seem natural.

1075
01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:18.635
I'd never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea...

1076
01:24:19.596 --> 01:24:22.056
...before or since.

1077
01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.646
And in May of 1945...

1078
01:24:29.814 --> 01:24:33.317
...when I was 26 years old...

1079
01:24:33.485 --> 01:24:35.194
...I came home.

1080
01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:38.072
I'm ready. I'm ready.

1081
01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:40.199
I'm coming.

1082
01:24:40.617 --> 01:24:43.952
- I'm ready.
- All right, I'm coming, Miss Alfalina.

1083
01:24:44.370 --> 01:24:45.746
- Queenie?
- Yes.

1084
01:24:50.668 --> 01:24:54.046
Oh! Sweet Jesus! Oh, you're home!

1085
01:24:55.673 --> 01:24:58.175
Oh, Lord, you came back.

1086
01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:00.135
- Let me look at you.
- Who's that, Mama?

1087
01:25:00.303 --> 01:25:03.514
- Child, it's your brother, Benjamin.
- I didn't know he was my brother.

1088
01:25:03.681 --> 01:25:06.892
There's a shitload of things you don't know.
Out, finish sweeping.

1089
01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:09.186
Wash your hands.
Help me with the table.

1090
01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:12.940
Turn around.
Oh, you look like you been born again.

1091
01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:14.858
Younger than the springtime.

1092
01:25:15.485 --> 01:25:19.029
I think that preacher laid hands on you
gave you a second life.

1093
01:25:19.197 --> 01:25:22.533
I knew it that moment I saw you,
you were special.

1094
01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.785
I tell you what, my knees are sore...

1095
01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:27.663
...because I've been on them every night
asking the Lord.

1096
01:25:27.831 --> 01:25:30.999
I said, "God, just bring him home safely."

1097
01:25:31.417 --> 01:25:33.669
You remember what I told you?

1098
01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:35.712
"You never know
what's coming for you"?

1099
01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:38.382
That's right. Sit down.

1100
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:43.512
Well, you learn anything worth repeating?

1101
01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:47.057
I sure saw some things.

1102
01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:49.143
Oh, you seen some pain.

1103
01:25:50.937 --> 01:25:52.229
Some joy too?

1104
01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:55.357
- Sure. Sure, I did.
- Yeah, that's what I wanna hear.

1105
01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:58.235
Look at you.

1106
01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:00.112
Where's Tizzy?

1107
01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.447
Oh, baby.

1108
01:26:04.033 --> 01:26:07.786
Mr. Weathers died in his sleep
one night last April.

1109
01:26:07.954 --> 01:26:12.082
- Mama, I'm so sorry.
- Don't you worry about that, baby.

1110
01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:15.586
Yeah, well, it's only one or two
of them left now.

1111
01:26:15.753 --> 01:26:17.421
Yeah, they all just about new.

1112
01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:21.258
Guess they waiting they turn
like everybody else, huh?

1113
01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:24.219
I'm so glad you back home with me.

1114
01:26:24.387 --> 01:26:27.472
Now, we gonna have to find you a wife
and a new job. That's right.

1115
01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.893
Come on in here, help me with this table.

1116
01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:34.021
Benjamin.

1117
01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:37.399
You're wasting your time, baby.
She's stone deaf.

1118
01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:41.278
Oh, and you'll be staying in what was
Mrs. DeSeroux's old room.

1119
01:26:41.696 --> 01:26:45.407
You too big to be rooming
with anybody else.

1120
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:51.830
It's a funny thing about coming home.

1121
01:26:51.998 --> 01:26:56.752
Looks the samet smells the same,
feels the same.

1122
01:26:58.546 --> 01:27:03.258
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

1123
01:27:04.135 --> 01:27:07.596
Once when I was sitting in my truck
just minding my own business.

1124
01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:17.522
You realize what's changed is you.

1125
01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.737
And late one morningt
not long after I'd been back...

1126
01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:25.614
Thank you.

1127
01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:48.637
Hey.

1128
01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:52.766
Oh.

1129
01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.518
Excuse me, is Queenie here?

1130
01:27:56.312 --> 01:27:57.562
Daisy?

1131
01:28:00.608 --> 01:28:03.277
It's me, Benjamin.

1132
01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.612
Benjamin?

1133
01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:10.993
Oh, my God.

1134
01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:16.123
Of course it's you. Benjamin.

1135
01:28:17.166 --> 01:28:19.876
How are you? It's been such a long time.

1136
01:28:20.044 --> 01:28:22.838
There's so much I want to know.
When did you get back?

1137
01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:25.590
- Well, I got back a few weeks ago.
- I spoke to Queenie.

1138
01:28:25.758 --> 01:28:28.385
She said you were in the war,
somewhere at sea.

1139
01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:31.805
- We was so worried about you.
- Oh, I'm okay.

1140
01:28:32.432 --> 01:28:34.725
Well, look at you.

1141
01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:36.727
You're so lovely.

1142
01:28:38.104 --> 01:28:40.397
You stopped writing.

1143
01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:44.693
"When I had left, she was a girl.

1144
01:28:44.861 --> 01:28:47.237
And a woman had taken her place.

1145
01:28:47.405 --> 01:28:50.324
She was the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen."

1146
01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.367
Beautiful.

1147
01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.371
"The most beautiful."

1148
01:28:58.041 --> 01:28:59.791
- Remember Grandma Fuller?
- Sure I do.

1149
01:28:59.959 --> 01:29:01.251
She passed.

1150
01:29:01.419 --> 01:29:02.753
I heard that. I'm sorry.

1151
01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.382
I just can't believe we're both here.
Must be fate.

1152
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:08.925
No, no, what do they call it?

1153
01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:10.927
Kismet.

1154
01:29:11.095 --> 01:29:13.055
Do you know about Edgar Cayce,
the psychic?

1155
01:29:13.222 --> 01:29:14.264
I don't believe I--

1156
01:29:14.432 --> 01:29:18.101
He says that everything
is predetermined...

1157
01:29:18.269 --> 01:29:21.605
...but I like to think of it as fate.

1158
01:29:23.608 --> 01:29:26.276
I'm not sure how it works,
but I'm glad it happened.

1159
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:30.655
Have you been to Manhattan?
It's right across the river from me.

1160
01:29:30.823 --> 01:29:35.118
Now, I can see the Empire State Building
if I stand on my bed.

1161
01:29:35.286 --> 01:29:37.788
What about you? Where have you been?
Tell me everything.

1162
01:29:37.955 --> 01:29:40.624
Last time you wrote,
you said you'd been to Russia.

1163
01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:43.085
I've always wanted to go to Russia.

1164
01:29:43.252 --> 01:29:45.003
Is it as cold as they say?

1165
01:29:45.171 --> 01:29:46.505
Twice as cold.

1166
01:29:46.672 --> 01:29:48.090
My goodness.

1167
01:29:48.257 --> 01:29:51.301
We always said you were different.

1168
01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:53.804
But I think you really are.

1169
01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:57.391
You wrote that you met somebody.

1170
01:29:57.558 --> 01:29:58.850
Did it work out?

1171
01:29:59.018 --> 01:30:00.644
It ran its course.

1172
01:30:02.271 --> 01:30:04.731
Hey, do you remember this?

1173
01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:20.497
"This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo
at 5 in the afternoon."

1174
01:30:21.874 --> 01:30:24.084
Would you like to have dinner?

1175
01:30:31.634 --> 01:30:35.011
Did I tell you that I danced
for Balanchine?

1176
01:30:35.179 --> 01:30:40.559
Oh, he's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.

1177
01:30:41.644 --> 01:30:45.856
You know, in a rehearsal oncet
a dancer fell.

1178
01:30:46.023 --> 01:30:50.360
And he just put it right into the production.
I meant can you imagine that?

1179
01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:55.740
Like in classical ballet.
You know, a dancer intentionally falling.

1180
01:30:55.908 --> 01:30:59.327
There's a whole new word for dance now.
It's called abstract.

1181
01:30:59.495 --> 01:31:00.996
He's not the only one, though.

1182
01:31:01.164 --> 01:31:03.331
There's Lincoln Kirstein
and Lucia Chase...

1183
01:31:03.499 --> 01:31:07.502
...and oh, myt there's Agnes de Mille.

1184
01:31:07.670 --> 01:31:11.465
She's torn up all those conventions,
all that straight up and down stuff.

1185
01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:15.343
It's not about the formality of the dance,
it's about what the dancer's feeling.

1186
01:31:15.511 --> 01:31:17.846
And she told me about
this big new world.

1187
01:31:18.014 --> 01:31:20.348
Names that didn't mean a thing to me.

1188
01:31:20.516 --> 01:31:23.018
I didn't really hear very much
of what she was saying.

1189
01:31:23.186 --> 01:31:25.145
It's new and it's modern
and it's American.

1190
01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:28.231
They understand our vigor
and our physicality.

1191
01:31:28.399 --> 01:31:30.734
Oh, my God.
I've just been talking and talking.

1192
01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:33.361
No, no, I've enjoyed listening.

1193
01:31:33.529 --> 01:31:34.988
I didn't know you smoked.

1194
01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:36.406
I'm old enough.

1195
01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.912
I'm old enough for a lot of things.

1196
01:31:45.708 --> 01:31:48.960
In New York, we stay up all night.

1197
01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:53.089
Watch the sun come up
over the warehouses.

1198
01:31:54.425 --> 01:31:56.968
There's always something to do.

1199
01:32:14.445 --> 01:32:16.988
- I have to go back tomorrow.
- Aw.

1200
01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:20.825
- So soon.
- Wish I could stay.

1201
01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:27.958
Dancers don't need costumes
or scenery any more.

1202
01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:32.087
I can imagine dancing completely naked.

1203
01:32:32.713 --> 01:32:34.965
Have you read D. H. Lawrence?

1204
01:32:35.132 --> 01:32:37.133
- Well, I--
- His books were banned.

1205
01:32:37.301 --> 01:32:40.971
The words are like making love.

1206
01:33:25.558 --> 01:33:27.559
In our company...

1207
01:33:28.561 --> 01:33:30.186
...we have to trust each other.

1208
01:33:35.359 --> 01:33:37.193
Sex...

1209
01:33:37.862 --> 01:33:40.196
...is a part of it.

1210
01:33:43.534 --> 01:33:46.870
You know, a lot of the dancers
are lesbians.

1211
01:33:48.664 --> 01:33:52.000
There was one woman
who wanted to sleep with me.

1212
01:33:58.924 --> 01:34:00.675
Does that upset you?

1213
01:34:00.843 --> 01:34:02.802
Which part?

1214
01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:05.722
Somebody wanting to sleep with me.

1215
01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:10.518
You're a desirable woman. I would think
most of them would wanna sleep with you.

1216
01:34:11.103 --> 01:34:12.520
Let's go back to the house.

1217
01:34:14.106 --> 01:34:17.442
Or we could get a room somewhere.

1218
01:34:19.403 --> 01:34:21.071
We could lay down your jacket.

1219
01:34:21.238 --> 01:34:25.909
I don't know, Daisy. It's not that
I wouldn't like to or anything.

1220
01:34:26.077 --> 01:34:28.912
I think I'd just disappoint you.

1221
01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.791
Oh, Benjamin, I've been with older men.

1222
01:34:32.958 --> 01:34:35.043
You're going back to New York
in the morning.

1223
01:34:35.211 --> 01:34:37.671
You should be with your friends.

1224
01:34:38.255 --> 01:34:40.757
- You're only young once.
- Oh, I'm old enough.

1225
01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:44.761
Daisy, just-- Not tonight is all.

1226
01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:58.858
We could go hear some music.

1227
01:35:01.612 --> 01:35:04.864
Our lives are defined by opportunities.

1228
01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:07.117
Even the ones we miss.

1229
01:35:07.284 --> 01:35:09.786
He looked so handsome...

1230
01:35:09.954 --> 01:35:11.204
...and so distinguished.

1231
01:35:11.372 --> 01:35:13.998
They're saying the hurricane's
gonna miss us, blow on by.

1232
01:35:14.166 --> 01:35:18.461
- Oh, that's great.
- I'll stay under the blankets with Mother.

1233
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:20.964
She said nothing would...

1234
01:35:21.674 --> 01:35:23.341
Benjamin?

1235
01:35:24.593 --> 01:35:26.928
"Things were becoming different for me."

1236
01:35:27.096 --> 01:35:30.682
My hair had very little gray
and grew like weeds.

1237
01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:34.060
My sense of smell was keener.
My hearing, more acute.

1238
01:35:34.645 --> 01:35:36.312
I could walk further and faster.

1239
01:35:37.648 --> 01:35:41.943
While everybody else was aging,
I was getting younger...

1240
01:35:42.319 --> 01:35:43.361
...all alone.

1241
01:35:46.282 --> 01:35:47.574
Come in.

1242
01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:50.160
Benjamin.

1243
01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:54.664
- Do you remember me?
- Well, sure I do, Mr. Button.

1244
01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:56.166
What happened to you?

1245
01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:59.335
Darn foot got infected, so...

1246
01:36:00.296 --> 01:36:01.671
Welcome home, my friend.

1247
01:36:04.216 --> 01:36:07.135
I see you're still drinking
your Sazerac with whiskey.

1248
01:36:07.303 --> 01:36:08.344
Creature of habit.

1249
01:36:08.512 --> 01:36:10.847
You still visiting the house
out on Bourbon Street?

1250
01:36:11.015 --> 01:36:13.057
Not for a long time.

1251
01:36:14.185 --> 01:36:16.352
Interesting times, though.

1252
01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:20.857
We went from making 40,000
to nearly half a million buttons a day.

1253
01:36:21.025 --> 01:36:22.984
We employed 10 times the number
of people.

1254
01:36:23.152 --> 01:36:25.862
We were operating around the clock.

1255
01:36:30.201 --> 01:36:32.035
Damn shame.

1256
01:36:32.661 --> 01:36:35.872
The war has been kind
to the button industry.

1257
01:36:38.417 --> 01:36:40.126
You know...

1258
01:36:42.004 --> 01:36:43.379
...I'm sick.

1259
01:36:43.547 --> 01:36:45.215
I don't know how much longer I have.

1260
01:36:45.382 --> 01:36:47.717
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button.

1261
01:36:47.885 --> 01:36:49.469
No, it...

1262
01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:53.681
I don't have any people. I keep to myself.

1263
01:36:55.226 --> 01:36:59.354
I hope you don't mind, but,
whenever possible, I'd enjoy your company.

1264
01:37:00.397 --> 01:37:03.900
I'll certainly do what I can.

1265
01:37:06.278 --> 01:37:09.322
Benjamin, do you know anything
about buttons?

1266
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:17.872
Now, Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 124 years.

1267
01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:22.585
My grandfather was a tailor.
He had a small shop in Richmond.

1268
01:37:22.753 --> 01:37:25.755
After the Civil War,
he moved to New Orleans...

1269
01:37:25.923 --> 01:37:30.260
...where my father had the wisdom
to make our own buttons.

1270
01:37:30.427 --> 01:37:33.388
So with his help...

1271
01:37:33.556 --> 01:37:35.431
...the tailor shop grew to this.

1272
01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:39.394
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

1273
01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:46.109
That's very, very interesting.

1274
01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:51.865
You sure have done well for yourself.

1275
01:37:52.241 --> 01:37:56.953
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Button?

1276
01:37:58.914 --> 01:38:00.290
Benjamin...

1277
01:38:00.958 --> 01:38:02.458
...you're my son.

1278
01:38:09.341 --> 01:38:13.094
I'm so sorry I never told you before.

1279
01:38:14.138 --> 01:38:17.599
You were born the night
the Great War ended.

1280
01:38:19.435 --> 01:38:22.979
Your mother died giving birth to you.

1281
01:38:24.648 --> 01:38:26.774
I thought you were a monster.

1282
01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:33.865
I promised your mother
I'd make sure you were safe.

1283
01:38:40.164 --> 01:38:42.749
I should never have abandoned you.

1284
01:38:46.503 --> 01:38:48.171
My mother?

1285
01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:52.175
At the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1286
01:38:52.343 --> 01:38:55.762
When I was a boy,
I'd love to wake up before anyone else...

1287
01:38:55.930 --> 01:38:59.390
...run down to that lake
and watch the day begin.

1288
01:39:00.684 --> 01:39:03.353
It was as if I was the only one alive.

1289
01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:07.649
I fell in love the first time I saw her.

1290
01:39:08.359 --> 01:39:11.486
Your mother's name
was Caroline Murphy.

1291
01:39:11.654 --> 01:39:14.280
She worked in
your grandfather's kitchen.

1292
01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:19.786
She was from Dublin.

1293
01:39:20.162 --> 01:39:24.540
In 1903, Caroline and all her brothers
and sisters came to live here...

1294
01:39:24.708 --> 01:39:26.542
...in New Orleans.

1295
01:39:28.337 --> 01:39:31.547
I'd find excuses
to go down to that kitchen...

1296
01:39:32.174 --> 01:39:34.217
...just so I could look at her.

1297
01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:44.227
April 25th, 1918.
Happiest day of my life.

1298
01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:47.480
The day I married your mother.

1299
01:39:48.899 --> 01:39:50.984
Why didn't you just tell me?

1300
01:39:51.944 --> 01:39:54.529
I plan on leaving everything I have
to you.

1301
01:39:56.532 --> 01:39:58.908
- I have to go.
- Where?

1302
01:39:59.743 --> 01:40:01.536
Home.

1303
01:40:01.704 --> 01:40:03.162
And what does he thinkt anyway?

1304
01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:06.666
He think he can just show up,
everything supposed to be fine and dandy.

1305
01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:09.210
Everybody just supposed to be friends.

1306
01:40:09.378 --> 01:40:12.213
Well, he got another thing coming,
that's for sure.

1307
01:40:12.381 --> 01:40:15.758
God be my witness,
he got another thing coming.

1308
01:40:15.926 --> 01:40:18.886
He left us $18 that night you was found.

1309
01:40:19.054 --> 01:40:21.723
Eighteen ratty dollars and a filthy diaper--

1310
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:23.808
Good night, Mama.

1311
01:40:23.976 --> 01:40:25.435
Good night, baby.

1312
01:40:38.532 --> 01:40:43.870
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

1313
01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:46.873
Once I was walking my dog
down the road.

1314
01:40:51.795 --> 01:40:53.796
I'm blind in the one eye...

1315
01:40:54.506 --> 01:40:56.632
...can't hardly hear...

1316
01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:59.469
...get twitches and shakes
out of nowhere...

1317
01:40:59.636 --> 01:41:02.263
...always losing my line of thought.

1318
01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:05.058
But you know what?

1319
01:41:05.392 --> 01:41:08.227
God keeps reminding me
I'm lucky to be alive.

1320
01:41:14.151 --> 01:41:16.152
Storm's coming.

1321
01:41:43.764 --> 01:41:46.808
May I help you, sir?
Up the stairs, first bedroom.

1322
01:42:02.866 --> 01:42:04.659
Wake up.

1323
01:42:06.703 --> 01:42:08.955
Let's get you dressed.

1324
01:42:35.941 --> 01:42:37.984
Get up, sir.

1325
01:42:40.946 --> 01:42:42.613
Thank you.

1326
01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:46.260
You can be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1327
01:43:46.428 --> 01:43:49.805
You can swear and curse the Fates...

1328
01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:53.142
...but when it comes to the end...

1329
01:43:53.977 --> 01:43:56.270
...you have to let go.

1330
01:44:17.709 --> 01:44:21.295
Well, it sure is a beautiful service.

1331
01:44:22.130 --> 01:44:25.508
He'll be buried right next to your mother.

1332
01:44:26.343 --> 01:44:28.844
You're my mother.

1333
01:44:31.848 --> 01:44:33.975
My baby.

1334
01:44:37.729 --> 01:44:39.772
Nowt I'd never seen New York.

1335
01:46:07.944 --> 01:46:09.779
Excuse me, I'm a friend of Daisy's.

1336
01:46:09.946 --> 01:46:11.739
Right this way.

1337
01:46:12.574 --> 01:46:14.950
Daisy has company. Daisy.

1338
01:46:15.118 --> 01:46:18.120
- Daisy.
- Yes?

1339
01:46:18.288 --> 01:46:19.622
We need the wardrobe.

1340
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:22.625
Is somebody looking for me?

1341
01:46:24.044 --> 01:46:26.545
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1342
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:29.215
What are you doing here?

1343
01:46:29.383 --> 01:46:31.175
Thought I'd come visit.

1344
01:46:31.343 --> 01:46:34.345
Spend some time with you, if I could.

1345
01:46:35.138 --> 01:46:38.474
Oh, well, I wish you would've called.

1346
01:46:39.142 --> 01:46:41.811
You took me by surprise.

1347
01:46:42.104 --> 01:46:43.729
- You can just throw them out.
- No.

1348
01:46:44.981 --> 01:46:47.149
Thank you, they're lovely.

1349
01:46:47.317 --> 01:46:51.987
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.
I thought you were mesmerizing.

1350
01:46:53.907 --> 01:46:57.660
Thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

1351
01:47:01.957 --> 01:47:05.334
I better get changed. A group of us are
going to a party. You wanna come?

1352
01:47:05.502 --> 01:47:08.504
Someone told me about a restaurant
I thought you might enjoy.

1353
01:47:08.672 --> 01:47:11.173
I made a reservation, just in case.

1354
01:47:11.341 --> 01:47:13.509
Just all of the dancers go out
after the show.

1355
01:47:13.677 --> 01:47:16.345
- Okay.
- You're welcome to come with us.

1356
01:47:16.513 --> 01:47:19.598
I'll get changed. All right?

1357
01:47:25.313 --> 01:47:28.649
She choreographs for
Ballets Russes. She's divine.

1358
01:47:28.817 --> 01:47:31.277
You were breathtaking.

1359
01:47:36.408 --> 01:47:38.075
Sweetie.

1360
01:47:39.161 --> 01:47:42.538
This is David.
He dances with the company.

1361
01:47:42.706 --> 01:47:44.248
This is Benjamin.

1362
01:47:44.708 --> 01:47:46.709
- I told you about him.
- Oh, yeah.

1363
01:47:46.877 --> 01:47:48.085
How you doing?

1364
01:47:48.253 --> 01:47:50.296
I'll go get you a drink.

1365
01:47:50.464 --> 01:47:52.715
All right. Thanks.

1366
01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:02.558
So you were a friend
of her grandmother's?

1367
01:48:02.726 --> 01:48:04.518
Or something like that?

1368
01:48:05.854 --> 01:48:07.313
Something like that.

1369
01:48:07.772 --> 01:48:09.440
Hey, excuse me.

1370
01:48:31.838 --> 01:48:33.172
Come on.

1371
01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:55.611
Hey.

1372
01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:59.615
Now, I had no idea you were coming.

1373
01:48:59.991 --> 01:49:02.326
Lord, Benjamin.

1374
01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:05.412
What did you expect?

1375
01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:08.457
What, you want me just
to drop everything?

1376
01:49:08.625 --> 01:49:10.000
Now, this is my life.

1377
01:49:10.168 --> 01:49:13.295
Babe. You going downtown?

1378
01:49:17.759 --> 01:49:19.385
Come on.

1379
01:49:19.553 --> 01:49:22.930
You'll have a good time. There's
lots of musicians, interesting people.

1380
01:49:23.098 --> 01:49:26.392
You don't have to do that.
This is my fault.

1381
01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:28.561
I should've called.

1382
01:49:28.728 --> 01:49:34.483
I thought I'd come here
and sweep you off your feet or something.

1383
01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:38.070
Daisy. Come on.

1384
01:49:38.572 --> 01:49:41.240
- Let's go.
- Be right there.

1385
01:49:41.992 --> 01:49:43.784
Seems nice.

1386
01:49:44.828 --> 01:49:46.495
Do you love him?

1387
01:49:49.541 --> 01:49:51.208
I think so.

1388
01:49:53.003 --> 01:49:54.712
I'm happy for you.

1389
01:49:56.673 --> 01:49:59.091
Maybe I'll see you at home.

1390
01:50:01.386 --> 01:50:03.304
Okay.

1391
01:50:04.598 --> 01:50:05.639
I enjoyed the show.

1392
01:50:13.857 --> 01:50:16.150
He came to tell me...

1393
01:50:16.401 --> 01:50:18.444
...his father had died.

1394
01:50:19.863 --> 01:50:21.113
You couldn't have known.

1395
01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:25.826
I was 23. I just didn't care.

1396
01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:29.830
What did you do next?

1397
01:50:29.998 --> 01:50:33.542
Some photographs, I think...

1398
01:50:33.710 --> 01:50:37.546
...in front of my gray bag.

1399
01:50:39.132 --> 01:50:43.969
I was as good a dancer
as I was ever gonna be.

1400
01:50:45.055 --> 01:50:48.515
For five years, I...

1401
01:50:49.893 --> 01:50:52.436
Oh, I danced everywhere.

1402
01:50:53.063 --> 01:50:56.398
London, Vienna, Prague.

1403
01:50:57.150 --> 01:50:58.859
I've never seen these.

1404
01:51:02.405 --> 01:51:04.073
Mom.

1405
01:51:04.741 --> 01:51:07.326
You never talked about your dancing.

1406
01:51:07.494 --> 01:51:13.582
Well, I was the only American
to be invited to dance with the Bolshoi.

1407
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:15.417
Sugar...

1408
01:51:16.419 --> 01:51:18.754
...it was glorious.

1409
01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:28.138
But Benjamin was never far
from my thoughts.

1410
01:51:29.766 --> 01:51:33.435
And I'd find myself saying:

1411
01:51:33.603 --> 01:51:35.437
"Good night, Benjamin."

1412
01:51:37.315 --> 01:51:39.608
"Good night, Daisy."

1413
01:51:39.776 --> 01:51:41.860
He said that?

1414
01:51:43.196 --> 01:51:44.988
"Life wasn't all that complicated.

1415
01:51:45.156 --> 01:51:48.117
If you want, you might say
I was looking for something."

1416
01:51:57.419 --> 01:52:01.630
Benjamin? Mrs. La Tourneau just passed.

1417
01:52:07.178 --> 01:52:09.054
A letter for Mr. Benjamin Button?

1418
01:52:09.222 --> 01:52:11.056
That'd be me.

1419
01:52:13.393 --> 01:52:15.144
Thank you.

1420
01:52:41.004 --> 01:52:42.838
Miss Daisy Fuller.

1421
01:52:43.006 --> 01:52:44.631
Just a minute. Please have a seat.

1422
01:52:44.799 --> 01:52:46.508
Sure.

1423
01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:58.145
Sometimes we're on a
collision course, and we just don't know it.

1424
01:52:58.313 --> 01:53:02.941
Whether it's by accident or by designt
there's not a thing we can do about it.

1425
01:53:05.528 --> 01:53:07.654
A woman in Paris was on her way
to go shopping.

1426
01:53:09.991 --> 01:53:13.285
But she had forgotten her coat,
went back to get it.

1427
01:53:13.703 --> 01:53:15.954
When she had gotten her coat,
the phone had rung.

1428
01:53:16.122 --> 01:53:19.291
So she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes.

1429
01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:23.420
While the woman was on the phonet
Daisy was rehearsing...

1430
01:53:23.588 --> 01:53:26.590
...for a performance
at the Paris Opera House.

1431
01:53:26.758 --> 01:53:29.593
And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now...

1432
01:53:29.761 --> 01:53:32.471
...had gone outside to get a taxi.

1433
01:53:36.476 --> 01:53:38.894
Nowt a taxi driver had dropped oe
a fare earlier...

1434
01:53:39.062 --> 01:53:41.855
...and had stopped
to get a cup of coeee.

1435
01:53:42.690 --> 01:53:45.943
And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing.

1436
01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:51.365
And this cab driver,
who dropped off the earlier fare...

1437
01:53:51.533 --> 01:53:53.617
...and had stopped
to get the cup of coffee...

1438
01:53:53.785 --> 01:53:56.078
...he picked up the lady
who was going shopping...

1439
01:53:56.246 --> 01:53:58.330
...and had missed getting the earlier cab.

1440
01:53:58.790 --> 01:54:01.416
The taxi had to stop for a man
crossing the street...

1441
01:54:01.584 --> 01:54:04.628
...who had left for work five minutes later
than he normally did...

1442
01:54:04.796 --> 01:54:06.755
...because he forgot to set his alarm.

1443
01:54:07.632 --> 01:54:10.759
While that mant late for work,
was crossing the street...

1444
01:54:10.927 --> 01:54:14.596
...Daisy had finished rehearsing
and was taking a shower.

1445
01:54:14.764 --> 01:54:16.265
And while Daisy was showering...

1446
01:54:16.432 --> 01:54:20.102
...the taxi was waiting outside a boutique
for the woman to pick up a package...

1447
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:23.856
...which hadn't been wrapped because
the girl who was supposed to wrap it...

1448
01:54:24.023 --> 01:54:27.025
...had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before and forgot.

1449
01:54:27.193 --> 01:54:30.779
When the package was wrapped,
the womant who was back in the cab...

1450
01:54:30.947 --> 01:54:32.781
...was blocked by a delivery truck.

1451
01:54:32.949 --> 01:54:35.534
All the whilet Daisy was getting dressed.

1452
01:54:37.036 --> 01:54:40.080
The delivery truck pulled away
and the taxi was able to move...

1453
01:54:40.248 --> 01:54:42.207
...while Daisy, the last to be dressed...

1454
01:54:42.375 --> 01:54:45.961
...waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.

1455
01:54:46.129 --> 01:54:49.381
While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light...

1456
01:54:49.549 --> 01:54:52.217
...Daisy and her friend came out
the back of the theater.

1457
01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:56.930
And if only one thing had
happened differently...

1458
01:54:57.098 --> 01:54:58.932
...if that shoelace hadn't broken...

1459
01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:01.643
...or that delivery truck
had moved moments earlier...

1460
01:55:01.811 --> 01:55:03.979
...or that package had been wrapped
and ready...

1461
01:55:04.147 --> 01:55:06.773
...because the girl hadn't broken up
with her boyfriend...

1462
01:55:06.941 --> 01:55:10.110
...or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier...

1463
01:55:10.278 --> 01:55:13.488
...or that taxi driver hadn't stopped
for a cup of coffee...

1464
01:55:13.656 --> 01:55:18.160
...or that woman had remembered her coat
and got into an earlier cab...

1465
01:55:18.328 --> 01:55:20.871
...Daisy and her friend
would have crossed the street...

1466
01:55:21.039 --> 01:55:23.749
...and the taxi would have driven by.

1467
01:55:34.469 --> 01:55:39.473
But, life being what it is,
a series of intersecting lives and incidents...

1468
01:55:39.641 --> 01:55:41.308
...out of anyone's control...

1469
01:55:42.018 --> 01:55:44.019
...that taxi did not go by...

1470
01:55:44.729 --> 01:55:47.272
...and that driver
was momentarily distracted.

1471
01:55:48.524 --> 01:55:51.026
- Daisy!
- And that taxi hit Daisy...

1472
01:55:51.194 --> 01:55:53.028
Daisy! Help!

1473
01:55:56.032 --> 01:55:58.742
...and her leg was crushed.

1474
01:56:05.458 --> 01:56:06.833
Daisy?

1475
01:56:10.964 --> 01:56:13.215
- Who told you?
- Your friend wired me.

1476
01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:18.887
Very kind of you to come all this way
to see that I was all right.

1477
01:56:20.139 --> 01:56:22.516
You'd do the same for me.

1478
01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:26.228
My God.

1479
01:56:27.355 --> 01:56:29.314
Look at you.

1480
01:56:29.983 --> 01:56:31.233
You're perfect.

1481
01:56:33.695 --> 01:56:35.821
I wish you hadn't come here.

1482
01:56:37.615 --> 01:56:39.199
I don't want you to see me like this.

1483
01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:46.915
Her leg had been broken in five places.

1484
01:56:47.083 --> 01:56:51.378
And with therapy and time,
she might walk again.

1485
01:56:51.754 --> 01:56:54.214
But she'd never dance.

1486
01:56:55.258 --> 01:56:57.259
I'm gonna take you home with me.

1487
01:56:57.427 --> 01:57:00.429
- I wanna look after you.
- I'm not going back to New Orleans.

1488
01:57:00.596 --> 01:57:02.264
Then I'll stay here in Paris.

1489
01:57:03.474 --> 01:57:07.310
Don't you understand?
I don't want your help.

1490
01:57:07.478 --> 01:57:11.773
I know I'm feeling sorry for myself,
but I don't want to be with you.

1491
01:57:11.941 --> 01:57:16.737
Tried to tell you that in New York.
You don't listen.

1492
01:57:17.071 --> 01:57:18.697
You might change your mind.

1493
01:57:19.282 --> 01:57:22.951
We are not little children any more,
Benjamin.

1494
01:57:24.245 --> 01:57:28.790
Just stay out of my life.

1495
01:57:50.396 --> 01:57:54.149
I was awfully cruel.

1496
01:57:54.692 --> 01:57:57.194
He didn't understand.

1497
01:57:57.361 --> 01:58:00.989
I couldn't have him see me like that.

1498
01:58:02.784 --> 01:58:04.326
"I didn't leave right away.

1499
01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:10.665
I stayed in Paris for a while
to look out for her."

1500
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:16.463
I never knew that.

1501
01:58:18.883 --> 01:58:23.136
Oh, darling,
could you get the nurse?

1502
01:58:28.518 --> 01:58:33.021
I taught myself to walk again.

1503
01:58:34.816 --> 01:58:38.151
I took the train to Lourdes.

1504
01:58:38.528 --> 01:58:40.862
Let's take a look.

1505
01:58:41.864 --> 01:58:44.157
That's normal. Pulse rate is slowing.

1506
01:58:44.325 --> 01:58:46.326
She is gonna struggle to breathe.

1507
01:58:46.536 --> 01:58:48.745
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

1508
01:59:01.884 --> 01:59:04.386
All right, he says, "I went back home."

1509
01:59:04.554 --> 01:59:07.722
And then there's a lot of pages torn out.

1510
01:59:07.890 --> 01:59:09.724
"I listened to the sound of the house."

1511
01:59:09.976 --> 01:59:12.394
I think I read that already.

1512
01:59:14.730 --> 01:59:18.900
He spilt something on it,
so it's hard to read, Mom.

1513
01:59:19.068 --> 01:59:21.778
Something about sailing.
Does that make sense?

1514
01:59:21.946 --> 01:59:26.408
I learned to sail an old boat
of my father's from the lake house.

1515
01:59:35.501 --> 01:59:37.210
I can't lie.

1516
01:59:37.378 --> 01:59:40.839
I did enjoy the company
of a woman or two.

1517
01:59:48.598 --> 01:59:50.599
Or maybe three.

1518
02:00:26.928 --> 02:00:30.347
I don't know why you bother, Sam.
Just gonna be there again tomorrow.

1519
02:00:35.061 --> 02:00:36.728
Mama.

1520
02:00:41.108 --> 02:00:44.486
And in the spring of 1962...

1521
02:00:47.490 --> 02:00:50.075
...she came back.

1522
02:01:08.511 --> 02:01:10.262
You wanna know where I've been?

1523
02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:12.514
No.

1524
02:01:13.975 --> 02:01:16.851
How come you didn't write or nothing?

1525
02:01:17.019 --> 02:01:18.812
Just disappearing like that.

1526
02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:21.523
It was something I needed
to do for myself.

1527
02:01:21.691 --> 02:01:25.360
Yeah, well, I never took you
to be the selfish type.

1528
02:01:25.528 --> 02:01:28.363
I sure hope I'm not wrong.

1529
02:01:29.115 --> 02:01:31.157
I'm usually not wrong about people.

1530
02:01:31.325 --> 02:01:34.494
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

1531
02:01:34.662 --> 02:01:36.329
Y'all have fun.

1532
02:01:39.125 --> 02:01:41.459
You haven't said two words.

1533
02:01:42.169 --> 02:01:43.962
I don't wanna ruin it.

1534
02:02:13.659 --> 02:02:16.745
- Sleep with me?
- Absolutely.

1535
02:02:53.741 --> 02:02:56.576
I asked her to come away with me.

1536
02:02:58.329 --> 02:03:02.457
We sailed into the Gulf
along the Florida Keys.

1537
02:03:42.873 --> 02:03:47.127
I am so glad we didn't find
one another when I was 26.

1538
02:03:47.294 --> 02:03:48.962
Why do you say that?

1539
02:03:49.130 --> 02:03:51.548
I was so young.

1540
02:03:51.715 --> 02:03:54.092
And you were so old.

1541
02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:56.219
It happened when
it was supposed to happen.

1542
02:03:56.387 --> 02:04:00.265
Hey, I will enjoy each and every
moment I have with you.

1543
02:04:05.646 --> 02:04:08.022
I bet I can stay out here longer than you.

1544
02:04:08.190 --> 02:04:10.191
I bet you can't.

1545
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:15.363
You have barely a line or a crease.

1546
02:04:15.531 --> 02:04:17.365
Every day I have more wrinkles.

1547
02:04:17.533 --> 02:04:19.742
It's not fair.

1548
02:04:20.327 --> 02:04:23.037
I love your wrinkles.

1549
02:04:23.205 --> 02:04:25.290
Both of them.

1550
02:04:29.753 --> 02:04:32.630
What's it like growing younger?

1551
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:36.843
I can't really say.

1552
02:04:37.052 --> 02:04:39.971
I'm always looking out my own eyes.

1553
02:04:44.143 --> 02:04:47.729
Will you still love me
when my skin grows old and saggy?

1554
02:04:47.938 --> 02:04:51.024
Will you still love me when I have acne?

1555
02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:53.568
When I wet the bed?

1556
02:04:53.861 --> 02:04:56.362
When I'm afraid
of what's under the stairs?

1557
02:05:04.205 --> 02:05:05.830
What?

1558
02:05:11.253 --> 02:05:12.462
What are you thinking?

1559
02:05:12.630 --> 02:05:15.840
Well, I was thinking how nothing lasts.

1560
02:05:17.635 --> 02:05:20.595
And what a shame that is.

1561
02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:24.849
Some things last.

1562
02:05:26.602 --> 02:05:28.686
Good night, Daisy.

1563
02:05:29.230 --> 02:05:31.523
Good night, Benjamin.

1564
02:05:47.164 --> 02:05:48.623
Mom?

1565
02:05:48.791 --> 02:05:50.458
Mm-hm.

1566
02:05:50.626 --> 02:05:51.960
When did you meet Dad?

1567
02:05:52.127 --> 02:05:55.129
Sometime after that.

1568
02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:00.134
Did you tell him about this Benjamin?

1569
02:06:00.302 --> 02:06:03.221
He knew enough, darling.

1570
02:06:22.449 --> 02:06:24.325
Mama?

1571
02:06:30.791 --> 02:06:32.625
Queenie?

1572
02:06:35.337 --> 02:06:36.754
Hello?

1573
02:06:36.922 --> 02:06:40.425
Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin.
Where is everybody?

1574
02:06:40.593 --> 02:06:43.428
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.

1575
02:06:44.972 --> 02:06:47.140
I'm so sorry.

1576
02:07:03.365 --> 02:07:05.533
I'm gonna miss you, Queenie.

1577
02:07:14.376 --> 02:07:17.587
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a great woman.

1578
02:07:17.755 --> 02:07:19.464
Our deepest condolences.

1579
02:07:19.923 --> 02:07:21.382
Thank you.

1580
02:07:25.054 --> 02:07:27.555
We buried her beside
her beloved Mr. Weathers.

1581
02:07:35.064 --> 02:07:38.399
And so we might have memories
of our own...

1582
02:07:38.567 --> 02:07:40.485
...we sold my father's house
on Esplanade.

1583
02:07:40.653 --> 02:07:43.738
It is a wonderful old place, darling.

1584
02:07:43.906 --> 02:07:46.658
I think we are going to be so happy here.

1585
02:07:46.825 --> 02:07:49.869
Oh. What a long family history you have.

1586
02:07:50.037 --> 02:07:52.121
They come with the house.

1587
02:07:54.375 --> 02:07:55.416
Come on.

1588
02:07:55.584 --> 02:07:58.211
You have to see the master suite.

1589
02:07:58.921 --> 02:08:01.756
We bought ourselves a duplex.

1590
02:08:03.217 --> 02:08:05.760
I loved that house.

1591
02:08:07.638 --> 02:08:10.390
It smelled like firewood.

1592
02:08:10.766 --> 02:08:12.266
Don't...

1593
02:08:12.434 --> 02:08:14.352
Don't stop, darling.

1594
02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:17.313
"It was one of the happiest times
of my life."

1595
02:08:17.523 --> 02:08:20.233
We didn't have a stick of furniture.

1596
02:08:20.818 --> 02:08:23.903
We would have picnics
in the living room.

1597
02:08:26.949 --> 02:08:28.991
We ate when we felt like it.

1598
02:08:29.159 --> 02:08:31.285
Stayed up all night when we wanted.

1599
02:08:32.454 --> 02:08:36.374
We vowed never to fall into routine,
to go to bed or wake up at the same time.

1600
02:08:37.459 --> 02:08:39.627
We lived on that mattress.

1601
02:09:15.414 --> 02:09:18.833
Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam,
was a physical therapist.

1602
02:09:20.335 --> 02:09:23.546
We lived four blocks from a public pool.

1603
02:10:01.418 --> 02:10:04.212
You know, you might've got
a few more years out of it...

1604
02:10:04.379 --> 02:10:09.759
...but you chose to do something
so special and unique...

1605
02:10:09.927 --> 02:10:13.554
...that there was only a short window
of time you could do it.

1606
02:10:15.432 --> 02:10:18.226
So even if nothing ever happened...

1607
02:10:18.393 --> 02:10:21.145
...well, you'd still be right here
where you are now.

1608
02:10:21.313 --> 02:10:23.731
I just don't like getting old.

1609
02:10:25.108 --> 02:10:27.902
They put too much chlorine in here.

1610
02:11:08.819 --> 02:11:13.823
I promise you I'll never lose myself
to self-pity again.

1611
02:11:17.077 --> 02:11:20.121
And I think right there and then...

1612
02:11:20.289 --> 02:11:24.876
...she realized none of us
is perfect forever.

1613
02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:30.631
She found peace.

1614
02:11:31.675 --> 02:11:34.468
She opened a studio
and taught young girls how to dance.

1615
02:11:34.636 --> 02:11:38.055
And tend...

1616
02:11:38.223 --> 02:11:41.934
Come back the other way.
And spot, spot, spot.

1617
02:11:42.102 --> 02:11:43.436
Excellent.

1618
02:11:43.604 --> 02:11:44.812
That was a good class.

1619
02:11:44.980 --> 02:11:47.273
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Good night.

1620
02:12:12.507 --> 02:12:15.843
You certainly are beautiful to watch.

1621
02:12:17.012 --> 02:12:20.473
Dancing's all about the line.

1622
02:12:21.767 --> 02:12:24.310
The line of your body.

1623
02:12:24.937 --> 02:12:30.358
Sooner or later, you lose that line,
and you never get it back.

1624
02:12:35.197 --> 02:12:39.075
I figure you were born in 1918...

1625
02:12:39.242 --> 02:12:41.077
...forty-nine years ago.

1626
02:12:41.244 --> 02:12:43.871
I'm 43.

1627
02:12:44.873 --> 02:12:48.668
We are almost the same age.

1628
02:12:50.712 --> 02:12:52.421
We're meeting in the middle.

1629
02:12:52.589 --> 02:12:54.507
We finally caught up with each other.

1630
02:12:56.093 --> 02:12:57.468
Wait.

1631
02:12:58.637 --> 02:13:02.181
I wanna remember us
just as we are now.

1632
02:13:12.025 --> 02:13:13.693
I'm pregnant.

1633
02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:35.589
You know, I swear the nurse slipped,
and said it was a boy.

1634
02:13:49.938 --> 02:13:52.606
But I think it's a girl.

1635
02:13:57.279 --> 02:13:59.030
I know you're afraid.

1636
02:13:59.531 --> 02:14:01.032
I'm not hiding it.

1637
02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:02.742
Okay.

1638
02:14:09.374 --> 02:14:11.917
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1639
02:14:12.085 --> 02:14:14.962
Then I will love it all the more.

1640
02:14:16.465 --> 02:14:18.215
Okay.

1641
02:14:18.383 --> 02:14:22.094
How can I be a father
when I'm heading in the other direction?

1642
02:14:22.262 --> 02:14:23.971
It's not fair to a child.

1643
02:14:24.139 --> 02:14:25.723
I don't wanna be anybody's burden.

1644
02:14:25.891 --> 02:14:28.476
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

1645
02:14:29.895 --> 02:14:31.937
I am gonna make this work.

1646
02:14:34.608 --> 02:14:37.318
I want this and I want it with you.

1647
02:14:37.486 --> 02:14:40.863
I want you to have everything you want,
all of it.

1648
02:14:41.031 --> 02:14:44.075
I'm just not sure how to reconcile this--

1649
02:14:44.242 --> 02:14:46.410
Would you tell a blind man
he couldn't have children?

1650
02:14:46.578 --> 02:14:47.995
Here you go.

1651
02:14:48.163 --> 02:14:51.707
You'll be a father for as long as you can.

1652
02:14:51.875 --> 02:14:54.585
I know the consequences.
I've accepted that.

1653
02:14:54.753 --> 02:14:58.089
Loving you is worth everything to me.

1654
02:15:01.802 --> 02:15:03.344
I have to go pee.

1655
02:15:17.526 --> 02:15:20.027
The oldest woman
to ever swim the English Channel...

1656
02:15:20.195 --> 02:15:22.363
- ...arrived here today in Calais...
- Keep it.

1657
02:15:22.531 --> 02:15:26.534
...having made the swim in 34 hours,
22 minutes and 14 seconds.

1658
02:15:26.701 --> 02:15:31.205
The 68-year-old Elizabeth Abbott
arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time...

1659
02:15:31.373 --> 02:15:33.249
...exhausted but happy.

1660
02:15:33.416 --> 02:15:37.002
Ms. Abbott, how would you sum up,
in words, this achievement?

1661
02:15:37.170 --> 02:15:39.296
I suppose...

1662
02:15:39.965 --> 02:15:43.551
...anything's possible. Heh, heh, heh.

1663
02:15:45.679 --> 02:15:46.720
- All right?
- Yes.

1664
02:15:46.888 --> 02:15:48.139
- You ready?
- Thank you.

1665
02:15:48.306 --> 02:15:49.932
Thank you all.

1666
02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:52.560
- Yeah.
- You're very kind.

1667
02:15:59.359 --> 02:16:03.779
In the springt on a day like any other...

1668
02:16:03.947 --> 02:16:06.282
I'll be back in an hour.

1669
02:16:10.954 --> 02:16:12.663
Honey?

1670
02:16:14.166 --> 02:16:15.541
Gotta call an ambulance.

1671
02:16:19.546 --> 02:16:21.088
The baby's coming.

1672
02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.340
Operator, I need an ambulance.

1673
02:16:23.508 --> 02:16:26.427
- The baby's coming.
- 2714 Napoleon.

1674
02:16:32.684 --> 02:16:36.020
There you go. Keep breathing.

1675
02:16:36.188 --> 02:16:39.440
Deep breath. Push.

1676
02:16:42.027 --> 02:16:44.904
Gonna go again. Breathe.

1677
02:16:48.366 --> 02:16:50.618
There we go.

1678
02:17:06.134 --> 02:17:10.304
Everyone's fine.
She's a perfectly healthy baby girl.

1679
02:17:16.478 --> 02:17:18.062
Honey?

1680
02:17:19.648 --> 02:17:24.109
She gave birth to a 5 pound,
4 ounce baby girl.

1681
02:17:39.501 --> 02:17:41.210
Did you count the toes?

1682
02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:47.383
She's perfect.

1683
02:17:47.550 --> 02:17:52.054
"And we named her for my mother,
Caroline."

1684
02:17:54.641 --> 02:17:57.393
This Benjamin was my father?

1685
02:17:58.270 --> 02:18:00.604
And this is how you tell me?

1686
02:18:05.902 --> 02:18:07.945
Excuse me.

1687
02:18:17.956 --> 02:18:21.166
Because all the ingredients
are there for a major storm...

1688
02:18:21.334 --> 02:18:24.420
...possibly even up to a Category Five.

1689
02:18:30.051 --> 02:18:34.888
Hey. I know it's hard.
You can't smoke in here.

1690
02:18:37.225 --> 02:18:38.892
Nobody can tell where it's gonna hit.

1691
02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:42.604
We have to go with the guidance we have,
incorporate that information...

1692
02:18:42.772 --> 02:18:44.565
...and then pass it along to you.

1693
02:18:51.865 --> 02:18:57.911
"You grew as the doctor had promised:
normal and healthy."

1694
02:19:05.378 --> 02:19:08.797
You're gonna have
to find a real father for her.

1695
02:19:11.634 --> 02:19:13.260
What are you talking about?

1696
02:19:13.595 --> 02:19:16.055
She's gonna need someone
to grow old with.

1697
02:19:16.765 --> 02:19:19.725
She'll learn to accept whatever happens.
She loves you.

1698
02:19:19.893 --> 02:19:22.853
Honey, she needs a father,
not a playmate.

1699
02:19:26.566 --> 02:19:27.775
- Is it me?
- Of course not.

1700
02:19:27.942 --> 02:19:30.277
- Is my age beginning to bother you?
- Of course not.

1701
02:19:30.445 --> 02:19:32.279
Is that what you're telling me?

1702
02:19:32.447 --> 02:19:35.115
You can't raise the both of us.

1703
02:19:42.791 --> 02:19:45.376
It was your first birthday.

1704
02:19:46.044 --> 02:19:48.420
We had a party for you.

1705
02:19:48.588 --> 02:19:50.297
House was filled with children.

1706
02:19:50.465 --> 02:19:52.299
- How are you?
- Hey, man.

1707
02:19:52.467 --> 02:19:55.969
Before you turn around,
they'll be in high school, dating.

1708
02:20:28.545 --> 02:20:32.089
I sold the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1709
02:20:32.674 --> 02:20:35.217
I sold Button's Buttons.

1710
02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:41.056
I sold my father's sailboat,
put it all into a savings account.

1711
02:20:42.225 --> 02:20:45.936
And so that you and your mother
might have a life...

1712
02:20:46.604 --> 02:20:48.480
...I left...

1713
02:20:48.648 --> 02:20:51.567
...before you could ever remember me.

1714
02:21:40.366 --> 02:21:43.494
"I left with just the clothes on my back."

1715
02:21:43.912 --> 02:21:46.288
I don't wanna read this now.

1716
02:21:46.456 --> 02:21:49.374
Can you just tell me where he went?

1717
02:21:50.001 --> 02:21:52.252
Oh, I don't really know.

1718
02:22:03.473 --> 02:22:05.140
It's for me.

1719
02:22:05.308 --> 02:22:07.559
1970. I was 2.

1720
02:22:07.727 --> 02:22:09.603
"Happy Birthday.

1721
02:22:11.356 --> 02:22:13.398
I wish I could have kissed you
good night."

1722
02:22:19.155 --> 02:22:20.989
They're all for me.

1723
02:22:21.866 --> 02:22:27.829
Five. "I wish I could have taken you
to your first day of school."

1724
02:22:31.543 --> 02:22:33.293
Six.

1725
02:22:34.170 --> 02:22:37.798
"I wish I could have been there
to teach you to play piano."

1726
02:22:40.718 --> 02:22:43.136
1981, 13.

1727
02:22:43.888 --> 02:22:47.808
"I wish I could have told you
not to chase some boy.

1728
02:22:48.434 --> 02:22:51.770
I wish I could have held you
when you had a broken heart.

1729
02:22:53.648 --> 02:22:56.441
I wish I could have been your father.

1730
02:22:57.110 --> 02:23:00.445
Nothing I ever did will replace that."

1731
02:23:06.786 --> 02:23:08.579
I guess he went to India.

1732
02:23:09.372 --> 02:23:12.082
"For what it's worth, it's never too late...

1733
02:23:12.250 --> 02:23:14.001
...or, in my case, too early..."

1734
02:23:15.086 --> 02:23:17.254
...to be whoever you wanna be.

1735
02:23:21.092 --> 02:23:24.011
There's no time limit.
Start whenever you want.

1736
02:23:26.764 --> 02:23:32.352
You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.

1737
02:23:34.105 --> 02:23:39.693
We can make the best or the worst of it.
I hope you make the best of it.

1738
02:23:42.822 --> 02:23:46.241
I hope you see things that startle you.

1739
02:23:47.535 --> 02:23:52.039
I hope you feel things
you never felt before.

1740
02:23:53.708 --> 02:23:57.794
I hope you meet people
with a different point of view.

1741
02:23:58.254 --> 02:24:01.465
I hope you live a life you're proud of.

1742
02:24:04.010 --> 02:24:06.470
And if you find that you're not...

1743
02:24:06.971 --> 02:24:09.640
...I hope you have the strength to...

1744
02:24:09.807 --> 02:24:12.351
"...start all over again."

1745
02:24:13.978 --> 02:24:17.898
He had been gone a long time.

1746
02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:21.943
I'll see you next Thursday.

1747
02:24:24.489 --> 02:24:27.949
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Oh, good night, sweetheart.

1748
02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:48.720
I'm sorry, we're closing.

1749
02:24:50.598 --> 02:24:52.599
Can I help you?

1750
02:24:53.726 --> 02:24:57.104
Are you here to pick somebody up?

1751
02:25:06.531 --> 02:25:08.281
Why did you come back?

1752
02:25:10.118 --> 02:25:11.660
Mom?

1753
02:25:12.286 --> 02:25:13.954
Mom?

1754
02:25:14.664 --> 02:25:16.748
You ready yet?

1755
02:25:19.252 --> 02:25:20.293
Mom, what's wrong?

1756
02:25:20.461 --> 02:25:23.880
I was just hearing a very sad story
about a mutual friend...

1757
02:25:24.048 --> 02:25:26.967
...who I hadn't seen for a very long time.

1758
02:25:27.844 --> 02:25:30.637
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

1759
02:25:30.805 --> 02:25:34.599
You knew him
when you were just a baby.

1760
02:25:35.935 --> 02:25:37.936
- Hi.
- Hi.

1761
02:25:39.147 --> 02:25:40.397
Hey.

1762
02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:44.943
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were done.

1763
02:25:45.111 --> 02:25:47.821
Oh, this is a friend of my family's.

1764
02:25:47.989 --> 02:25:52.826
Benjamin Button,
this is my husband, Robert.

1765
02:25:52.994 --> 02:25:54.453
How do you do?

1766
02:25:54.620 --> 02:25:56.371
A pleasure.

1767
02:26:03.629 --> 02:26:06.173
Well, it was very nice to meet you.

1768
02:26:06.549 --> 02:26:08.467
- We'll be in the car, darling.
- All right.

1769
02:26:08.634 --> 02:26:10.510
Bye.

1770
02:26:10.678 --> 02:26:12.596
I'm just locking up.

1771
02:26:20.605 --> 02:26:21.938
She's beautiful.

1772
02:26:22.815 --> 02:26:26.193
Like her mother. Does she dance?

1773
02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:29.362
- Not very well.
- I guess that'd be from my side of things.

1774
02:26:29.530 --> 02:26:32.240
She's a dear, sweet girl.

1775
02:26:32.867 --> 02:26:35.702
She seems a little lost.

1776
02:26:36.078 --> 02:26:37.329
But then, who isn't at 12?

1777
02:26:37.497 --> 02:26:41.500
A lot of her reminds me of you.

1778
02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:46.713
My husband, he's a widower.
Or was a widower.

1779
02:26:46.881 --> 02:26:51.885
He's an incredibly kind, just bright,
adventurous man.

1780
02:26:53.930 --> 02:26:55.680
He's been a terrific father.

1781
02:26:55.848 --> 02:26:57.307
Good.

1782
02:27:01.354 --> 02:27:03.855
You are so much younger.

1783
02:27:04.023 --> 02:27:06.191
Only on the outside.

1784
02:27:07.318 --> 02:27:09.194
You were right.

1785
02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:13.406
I couldn't have been raising both of you.

1786
02:27:14.033 --> 02:27:16.284
I'm not that strong.

1787
02:27:20.081 --> 02:27:22.415
So where are you staying?

1788
02:27:24.877 --> 02:27:25.919
What are you gonna do?

1789
02:27:26.087 --> 02:27:29.631
I'm staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel
on the Avenue.

1790
02:27:29.799 --> 02:27:32.592
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1791
02:27:33.427 --> 02:27:35.178
But...

1792
02:27:41.102 --> 02:27:43.478
They're waiting.

1793
02:28:24.812 --> 02:28:26.980
I remember that.

1794
02:28:27.148 --> 02:28:28.440
That was him?

1795
02:28:28.608 --> 02:28:30.567
Just look at the satellite picture.

1796
02:28:30.735 --> 02:28:33.612
The hurricane changed directions.
It's going to make landfall.

1797
02:28:33.821 --> 02:28:35.155
Am I supposed to do something?

1798
02:28:35.323 --> 02:28:37.324
Arrangements are being made
to move people.

1799
02:28:37.491 --> 02:28:39.409
No. No, we're staying.

1800
02:28:39.577 --> 02:28:41.494
I'll let you know if anything changes.

1801
02:28:43.873 --> 02:28:48.043
"That night, while I was sitting
and wondering why I came back at all...

1802
02:28:48.210 --> 02:28:50.420
...there was a knock at the door."

1803
02:28:54.342 --> 02:28:55.759
Come in.

1804
02:29:09.857 --> 02:29:11.691
Are you all right?

1805
02:29:14.695 --> 02:29:19.491
I'm sorry, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

1806
02:29:27.708 --> 02:29:29.960
Nothing lasts.

1807
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:35.632
I have never stopped loving you.

1808
02:29:41.055 --> 02:29:44.349
Oh, but, Benjamin,
I'm an old woman now.

1809
02:29:54.193 --> 02:29:56.528
Some things you never forget.

1810
02:30:16.799 --> 02:30:19.718
Few people even know
that you were in jail in the first place.

1811
02:30:19.885 --> 02:30:22.929
I'll tell you, I am sick about it too,
because, please...

1812
02:30:23.097 --> 02:30:25.932
...if they're not gonna give you an award
like "Man of the Year"...

1813
02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:29.728
...at least what they could do
is stop having you listed as an ex-convict...

1814
02:30:29.895 --> 02:30:32.939
...which I think is, again, so unfair.

1815
02:30:45.077 --> 02:30:47.120
Good night, Benjamin.

1816
02:30:48.456 --> 02:30:50.915
Good night, Daisy.

1817
02:30:53.335 --> 02:30:55.962
And as I knew I would...

1818
02:30:56.130 --> 02:30:58.590
...I watched her go.

1819
02:31:00.134 --> 02:31:02.761
That's the last thing he wrote.

1820
02:31:04.096 --> 02:31:08.183
Sometime after your father had passed...

1821
02:31:08.350 --> 02:31:11.936
...there was a call.

1822
02:31:14.648 --> 02:31:16.483
Hello.

1823
02:31:16.650 --> 02:31:18.651
Yes, speaking.

1824
02:31:21.864 --> 02:31:23.448
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1825
02:31:33.501 --> 02:31:36.169
Uh, it's the corner house.

1826
02:31:57.650 --> 02:31:58.983
Come on in.

1827
02:32:04.615 --> 02:32:06.950
- I'm Daisy Fuller.
- I'm David Hernandez with...

1828
02:32:07.118 --> 02:32:10.286
...the Orleans Parish Department
of Child Welfare Services.

1829
02:32:10.746 --> 02:32:12.705
He was living in a condemned building.

1830
02:32:15.042 --> 02:32:17.502
The police found this with him.

1831
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:20.046
This address.
It's got your name in it a lot.

1832
02:32:21.549 --> 02:32:24.551
He's in very poor health.
He was taken to the hospital.

1833
02:32:24.718 --> 02:32:28.179
He doesn't seem to know who
or where he is. He's very confused.

1834
02:32:28.347 --> 02:32:31.975
I was telling Mr. Hernandez
that Benjamin is one of us.

1835
02:32:32.143 --> 02:32:35.895
If he needs a place to stay,
it's all right, he can stay here.

1836
02:33:05.426 --> 02:33:07.010
Benjamin?

1837
02:33:08.012 --> 02:33:09.345
Oh.

1838
02:33:10.556 --> 02:33:13.016
You play beautifully.

1839
02:33:15.895 --> 02:33:19.397
He doesn't like to be touched.
He goes in and out of states of recognition.

1840
02:33:19.565 --> 02:33:24.444
Doctors say if they didn't know any better,
he has the beginnings of dementia.

1841
02:33:25.613 --> 02:33:27.280
Do you remember me?

1842
02:33:30.743 --> 02:33:32.660
I'm Daisy.

1843
02:33:34.413 --> 02:33:36.581
I'm Benjamin.

1844
02:33:41.754 --> 02:33:44.547
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

1845
02:33:46.050 --> 02:33:48.927
Would you mind if I sit with you?

1846
02:33:49.220 --> 02:33:52.263
I would love to hear you play.

1847
02:33:55.267 --> 02:33:56.768
Do I know you?

1848
02:34:01.815 --> 02:34:02.857
I want some breakfast.

1849
02:34:03.025 --> 02:34:06.611
And every day, I would stop by
to make sure that he was comfortable.

1850
02:34:06.779 --> 02:34:08.112
- You just ate.
- No, I didn't.

1851
02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:10.114
You just finished eating, Mr. Benjamin.

1852
02:34:10.282 --> 02:34:14.744
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing. You're all fucking liars.

1853
02:34:15.412 --> 02:34:17.997
He doesn't believe
he just had his breakfast.

1854
02:34:19.708 --> 02:34:21.793
Now...

1855
02:34:21.961 --> 02:34:27.090
...why don't we see if we can't find
something else for you to do, hm?

1856
02:34:27.258 --> 02:34:30.510
I have a feeling there's
a lot of things I can't remember.

1857
02:34:30.678 --> 02:34:32.845
Well, like what, sugar?

1858
02:34:33.639 --> 02:34:35.223
It's like...

1859
02:34:36.016 --> 02:34:38.601
...there's this whole life I had...

1860
02:34:38.769 --> 02:34:41.854
...and I can't remember what it was.

1861
02:34:44.024 --> 02:34:46.025
It's okay.

1862
02:34:47.361 --> 02:34:49.195
It's okay to forget things.

1863
02:34:49.488 --> 02:34:55.118
Many times, he would simply forget
who or where he was.

1864
02:34:55.286 --> 02:34:56.786
He's up there on the roof.

1865
02:34:56.954 --> 02:34:58.329
It wasn't easy.

1866
02:34:58.497 --> 02:34:59.747
Benjamin.

1867
02:34:59.915 --> 02:35:02.375
I can see everything.
I can see the big river.

1868
02:35:02.543 --> 02:35:04.419
That's right, you can see everything.

1869
02:35:04.586 --> 02:35:07.922
I can see the graveyard where Mama's
buried and all those other people.

1870
02:35:08.090 --> 02:35:09.882
I want you to come down.

1871
02:35:10.426 --> 02:35:12.051
What if I could fly?

1872
02:35:12.219 --> 02:35:13.886
I knew a man who could fly.

1873
02:35:15.222 --> 02:35:18.391
You come down
and I'll tell you all about him.

1874
02:35:21.729 --> 02:35:23.479
Somebody go up there.

1875
02:35:29.903 --> 02:35:32.780
He was 5 when I moved in.

1876
02:35:32.948 --> 02:35:38.161
Nearly the same age
I was when I had met him.

1877
02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:49.881
"This is the picture of
Old Man Kangaroo at 5 in the afternoon...

1878
02:35:50.049 --> 02:35:53.259
...when he had got
his beautiful hind legs."

1879
02:35:54.595 --> 02:35:56.220
The days passed...

1880
02:35:56.388 --> 02:36:01.768
...and I watched
as he forgot how to walk and...

1881
02:36:05.647 --> 02:36:08.441
- ...how to talk.
- What's my name?

1882
02:36:08.609 --> 02:36:10.610
I'm Daisy.

1883
02:36:11.028 --> 02:36:13.738
Can you say Daisy?

1884
02:36:14.281 --> 02:36:20.536
In 2002t they put up a new clock
in that train station.

1885
02:36:26.418 --> 02:36:31.005
And in the spring of 2003...

1886
02:36:34.510 --> 02:36:37.470
...he looked at me...

1887
02:36:38.806 --> 02:36:44.894
...and I knew that he knew who I was.

1888
02:36:47.398 --> 02:36:51.150
And then he closed his eyes as if...

1889
02:36:51.568 --> 02:36:54.112
...to go to sleep.

1890
02:37:25.853 --> 02:37:26.936
I wish I'd known him.

1891
02:37:28.522 --> 02:37:30.898
Now you do.

1892
02:37:34.528 --> 02:37:38.531
Mom, I think I should go see
what's going on.

1893
02:37:45.205 --> 02:37:47.373
Good night, Benjamin.

1894
02:38:09.646 --> 02:38:12.315
They're expecting
flash floodingt having a levy break...

1895
02:38:12.483 --> 02:38:14.692
...and the current in the Ninth Ward.

1896
02:38:17.362 --> 02:38:20.490
Some people are born to sit by a river.

1897
02:38:21.658 --> 02:38:23.910
Some get struck by lightning.

1898
02:38:25.537 --> 02:38:28.247
Some have an ear for music.

1899
