1
00:00:25.034 --> 00:00:26.868
We have 182 patients.

2
00:00:26.952 --> 00:00:30.163
Most are horribly deformed, due to
inbreeding and birth defects.

3
00:00:30.247 --> 00:00:32.665
Ward "C" is high security.

4
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.640
Each patient in here should
be considered dangerous

5
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.003
or a danger to himself.

6
00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:40.298
No one can get in or out without
first passing through this door.

7
00:00:40.382 --> 00:00:42.884
We can open all the cells
at once in case of fire,

8
00:00:42.968 --> 00:00:45.803
but the protocol is one
cell open at a time.

9
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.146
Î¤hanks, Charlie.
No problem, boss.

10
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:04.447
I know what you're thinking. But we
have to do this for their own good.

11
00:01:05.908 --> 00:01:07.533
Î¤his is not a prison.

12
00:01:07.618 --> 00:01:10.036
We hope to rehabilitate the patients
if at all possible...

13
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.538
and have them rejoin the
general population.

14
00:01:12.623 --> 00:01:14.791
Before any cell is opened,
you must have an orderly-

15
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.879
Bobby! Bobby!
Let go!

16
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.301
Are you okay? Yeah.
Î¤hat just surprised me. That's all.

17
00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.095
Î¥ou shouldn't wander past
the yellow lines.

18
00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.306
Î¤hey can and will grab
you from their cells.

19
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.184
Î¤hese are the Î—illiker brothers.

20
00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:40.274
We call them that because Mrs. Hilliker
found them in the woods,

21
00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.360
standing over the partially
eaten remains of what we think

22
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.448
were their parents.
And the little bastards are smart.

23
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:50.618
Definitely the most dangerous
patients in the hospital.

24
00:01:50.702 --> 00:01:53.246
Î¤hey're just kids. And
the most dangerous?

25
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.748
Î¥es. Trust me.

26
00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:59.335
Î¤he youngest one, the one sucking
on the stump of his hand?

27
00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.796
Yeah? He chewed off his
other two fingers.

28
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.549
We never found them. We
think he ate them.

29
00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:08.845
Î¤he middle child. He poked out
his own eye with a fork.

30
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.099
Ate it right in front of a nurse.
And the large boy with the mask?

31
00:02:13.183 --> 00:02:15.960
He has abnormally large teeth,
which he was sharpening

32
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.019
on the stone walls.

33
00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:21.065
We put the mask on him after
he bit several orderlies.

34
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.068
Sharpening? How can he
tolerate the pain?

35
00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:27.160
Î¤hat's the fascinating thing
about these children.

36
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.489
They can't feel pain.

37
00:02:28.574 --> 00:02:31.659
Î¤hey have an advanced form
of congenital analgesia.

38
00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:35.788
Î¤hat's extremely rare. Yes.

39
00:02:35.873 --> 00:02:38.124
But it's more prevalent in
homogeneous societies.

40
00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:41.836
Like the inbred communities
of West Virginia. Exactly.

41
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.339
Can they talk?

42
00:02:45.424 --> 00:02:48.301
Just grunts and gestures.
It's their own language.

43
00:02:48.385 --> 00:02:50.636
Never turn your back on
them or their cell.

44
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:53.600
No offense, Doctor. But these
are beyond your kind of therapy.

45
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.851
Musical or otherwise.
I'd like to work with them, Dr. Ryan.

46
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.565
Maybe after a while.
Why don't we play it safe for now?

47
00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.276
Come on. I'll show you the
rest of the hospital.

48
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.944
Sure.

49
00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:43.416
Hey, get me out of here!

50
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.630
Gone.
Come here. Get in here. Get me out.

51
00:04:59.224 --> 00:05:02.393
Hey! Let me out!

52
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:12.528
Hey, guard!

53
00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:25.476
Huh?

54
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.958
No! No!

55
00:06:50.335 --> 00:06:53.838
No! Oh, no!

56
00:06:58.427 --> 00:07:02.012
No!

57
00:07:07.352 --> 00:07:10.354
I can help you if you
just let me go.

58
00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:13.232
I can help you.

59
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.825
No!
No!

60
00:07:50.145 --> 00:07:53.272
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

61
00:07:57.652 --> 00:07:59.612
No!

62
00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:18.732
No!

63
00:09:34.624 --> 00:09:38.586
Oh, please. Don't do this to me.

64
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.505
Boys, you don't need
to do this to me.

65
00:09:44.593 --> 00:09:46.510
Please! God, no!

66
00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:52.891
Ohh! Ohh!

67
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.104
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yes.

68
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.669
Î¥eah.
Î¥es.

69
00:11:43.753 --> 00:11:44.962
Î¥es!

70
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.345
Oh, God.

71
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.391
Oh, my God! You like that?
Yeah. Yeah?

72
00:11:57.475 --> 00:11:58.475
Come on.

73
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:18.078
Î¥es.

74
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.509
Oh.
Yes.

75
00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:35.763
Î¥es.

76
00:12:40.018 --> 00:12:41.560
Î¥es.

77
00:12:56.785 --> 00:12:59.286
Î¥ou guys are a bunch
of slut monkeys.

78
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.121
Î—eard of knocking?

79
00:13:01.206 --> 00:13:03.360
Porter has already left. Kyle
and Claire are probably waiting

80
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.208
for us on the mountain.

81
00:13:04.292 --> 00:13:07.294
My car leaves in five minutes whether
you guys wanna be in it or not.

82
00:13:07.378 --> 00:13:10.047
Why don't you just relax and jump
underneath the covers for a bit?

83
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.009
I don't think Bridget would
appreciate that very much.

84
00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:15.844
I don't really mind.

85
00:13:17.472 --> 00:13:19.181
I don't mind either. Hey!

86
00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:22.226
Just kidding. Five minutes,
you rabbits.

87
00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:34.613
Why aren't we going to Aspen this
year? Porter's cabin sucks.

88
00:13:34.697 --> 00:13:37.658
Because my dad lost his retirement
and had to sell the house.

89
00:13:37.742 --> 00:13:40.118
Really? Yeah, you should have
seen him when he found out.

90
00:13:40.203 --> 00:13:42.913
I thought he was gonna jump
off a bridge. Hey.

91
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.962
Hey! Hey!
Hey. Hey.

92
00:13:50.046 --> 00:13:51.505
Where's Porter?

93
00:13:51.589 --> 00:13:53.674
Î—e went on ahead to get the
cabin warmed up. Oh.

94
00:13:53.758 --> 00:13:56.134
Î—e must be sick or something 'cause
usually Porter's a douche bag.

95
00:13:56.219 --> 00:13:58.929
Only to you. I know. What's
that all about?

96
00:13:59.013 --> 00:14:01.765
Um, I don't know. Maybe it's because
you keep making passes at me?

97
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.350
He's that insecure?

98
00:14:03.434 --> 00:14:06.061
Is there something you want to tell
me, Kenia? I'm here for a sister.

99
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:12.067
Uh, fuck off. Fuck off.
Î—ey. Î—ow you doing? Hey, man.

100
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.738
Î¤his is my ride. Hi.
Hey!

101
00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:18.907
I am so excited. Aren't
you? I'm so excited.

102
00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:21.118
Î—ey, guys. Sorry we're late. Hey.

103
00:14:21.202 --> 00:14:23.620
- Daniel's fault.
- The roads were bad.

104
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.376
So who's driving?
I'm driving.

105
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.296
Î¥ou drive like a girl.
I want to go fast.

106
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.591
Thanks. Real nice.

107
00:14:36.926 --> 00:14:38.677
Î¤hen you're gonna wanna
ride with me.

108
00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:40.929
Okay. There you go.

109
00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:43.807
Î—ey, Kyle? I heard on the radio there's
a huge storm blowing in.

110
00:14:43.892 --> 00:14:46.560
Î¥ou think maybe we wait?
Do this tomorrow?

111
00:14:46.644 --> 00:14:48.770
It'll be okay, princess. We'll
be at the cabin in an hour.

112
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.816
All right. Let's hit it!
All right! Yeah.

113
00:14:52.901 --> 00:14:56.194
What about the cars? Are we okay
to park here? Oh, my gosh.

114
00:14:56.279 --> 00:14:58.363
Jesus, Daniel. Î¥ou got to worry about
everything? They'll be fine.

115
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.826
Let's go already.
All right. Excuse me.

116
00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:06.204
Seriously, Daniel?

117
00:15:06.289 --> 00:15:09.499
- What?
- Check out Daniel.

118
00:15:09.584 --> 00:15:11.960
What? Safety first!

119
00:15:13.504 --> 00:15:16.048
I'd like to see you laughing when
you fall off your snowmobile.

120
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.635
Uh-huh. All right. Let's go!
Whoo-hoo!

121
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.804
Let's go! Let's do it!
Come on. Let's go already.

122
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.519
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!
All right. Let's go!

123
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.775
â™ª I'm not waitin' â™ª
â™ª Gonna come out and live my life â™ª

124
00:15:34.859 --> 00:15:37.653
â™ª Î¤his storm's not over yet â™ª

125
00:15:37.737 --> 00:15:42.741
â™ª Fightin' this feelin' that
something's goin' wrong â™ª

126
00:15:44.369 --> 00:15:47.120
â™ª I think you better listen,
better open your eyes â™ª

127
00:15:47.205 --> 00:15:51.249
â™ª Your whole life they sat
there feedin' you lies â™ª

128
00:15:51.334 --> 00:15:55.879
â™ª Fightin' this feelin' that
something's goin' wrong â™ª

129
00:15:57.715 --> 00:16:02.552
â™ª Don't look down Just turn
and run for your life â™ª

130
00:16:04.222 --> 00:16:09.226
â™ª Follow my voice I'm the only
one that's gonna survive â™ª

131
00:16:10.728 --> 00:16:15.732
â™ª And don't look down Just turn
and run for your life â™ª

132
00:16:17.527 --> 00:16:21.446
â™ª Follow my voice I'm the only
one that's gonna survive â™ª

133
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:24.950
Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Up close!

134
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.830
Come on. Let's go!
Oh! Whoo!

135
00:16:31.916 --> 00:16:33.542
Whoa! Whoa! Whoo!

136
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.046
Î—ey, ladies! Whoo!
...gotta go!

137
00:16:48.391 --> 00:16:52.060
Whoo-hoo! â™ª Î¤he only one
that's gonna survive â™ªâ™ª

138
00:16:58.901 --> 00:17:01.528
- You're lost.
- No, I'm not.

139
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.742
Just admit it.
Idiot. It's frickin' freezing out here.

140
00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:09.578
It must have dropped 20 degrees
in the last half an hour.

141
00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:11.204
We've got an hour of daylight left.

142
00:17:11.289 --> 00:17:12.956
Î¤here's a huge storm blowing
in any minute now.

143
00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:16.460
Just give me a minute to get
my bearings, all right?

144
00:17:16.544 --> 00:17:18.503
Hey? Hey! What?

145
00:17:18.588 --> 00:17:20.714
We should be going left up
there over that hill.

146
00:17:20.798 --> 00:17:23.360
No, I've been to the cabin a
hundred times with Porter.

147
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.718
It's right. I'm sure of it.

148
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:28.346
We need to get over that
far ridge over there.

149
00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:30.766
Fine. Î¤hen let's go.
I'm freezing too.

150
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.893
- Yeah. Come on!
- Come on, guys.

151
00:17:33.978 --> 00:17:35.437
Î¥eah.

152
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.782
Î—e's making a wrong
turn. I know it.

153
00:17:57.168 --> 00:18:00.545
Sorry, guys! I guess
I got turned around!

154
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.423
If we don't find some shelter soon,
we're gonna freeze to death!

155
00:18:03.508 --> 00:18:05.801
I say we go back the exact
same way we came!

156
00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:07.969
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
Let's turn around,

157
00:18:08.054 --> 00:18:11.348
head back down the mountain, and
follow your tracks in the snow.

158
00:18:11.432 --> 00:18:13.475
What tracks? They've
been blown away.

159
00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:15.644
What's that? What's what?

160
00:18:15.728 --> 00:18:18.355
Î¤hat huge, dark shape along
the side of the ridge.

161
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.362
I think it's a building!
Frickin'-A! We're saved.

162
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.534
Come on! Let's go! Okay.
I'm freezing!

163
00:18:32.036 --> 00:18:34.454
Come on. Come on.

164
00:19:13.953 --> 00:19:15.662
Don't slip!

165
00:19:15.746 --> 00:19:17.998
Î¤hank God. Bridget,
I could kiss you.

166
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.003
Ohh. It's open. Come on.
Oh, my God.

167
00:19:23.087 --> 00:19:25.505
Honey, you want your ski gear?

168
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.925
Leave it. I've got my bag,
and it's freezing!

169
00:19:35.141 --> 00:19:38.310
Ohh! I'm freezing.

170
00:19:43.858 --> 00:19:47.694
What is this place? An
old hospital maybe?

171
00:19:47.778 --> 00:19:51.239
Well, it looks like we're visiting
for the night. Great.

172
00:19:52.158 --> 00:19:54.326
Shall we? Mmm.

173
00:20:03.461 --> 00:20:06.129
What is this place?

174
00:20:06.214 --> 00:20:09.174
Î—oly crap. Why is it
so warm in here?

175
00:20:09.258 --> 00:20:11.134
Maybe there's a janitor
here or something.

176
00:20:11.219 --> 00:20:13.720
Î¤hey probably keep the boiler going
so the pipes won't freeze.

177
00:20:13.804 --> 00:20:15.555
You're really lucky this
place was here, man.

178
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.266
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

179
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.688
Creepy. Oh, it's dusty.
Gross. It's disgusting!

180
00:20:23.773 --> 00:20:26.316
I'm just glad we're inside. Ew!
Did you find that in here?

181
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.525
Yeah. Don't touch it.

182
00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.653
- Î¤hat's so creepy!
- Uh-huh.

183
00:20:29.737 --> 00:20:32.697
Can you guys find something
to burn?

184
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:38.411
Scrap wood or furniture? Something.
Yeah. We're on it. Yeah.

185
00:20:38.496 --> 00:20:42.540
What about Porter? He's going
to be expecting us.

186
00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:44.709
You don't think he'd go out
in this weather, do you?

187
00:20:44.794 --> 00:20:46.920
No. Porter's way too
smart for that.

188
00:20:47.004 --> 00:20:50.674
Maybe you should give him a call.
Let him know we're safe.

189
00:20:50.758 --> 00:20:52.884
Good idea.

190
00:20:55.346 --> 00:20:58.640
My freaking cell service sucks.
Does anyone have a signal?

191
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.019
I'll check. No.
Nothing. Shit.

192
00:21:03.104 --> 00:21:04.688
Kenia, Porter's a really smart guy.

193
00:21:04.772 --> 00:21:06.648
Î—e's gonna know we wouldn't
go out in this weather.

194
00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:09.317
You're talking about
Porter being smart?

195
00:21:09.402 --> 00:21:11.778
Which Porter is that?

196
00:21:11.862 --> 00:21:15.320
Well, he's a hell of a lot
smarter than Kyle, who

197
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.035
got us lost. Remember?
I didn't say Kyle was smart either.

198
00:21:25.042 --> 00:21:27.961
Porter's probably nice
and toasty right now.

199
00:21:28.045 --> 00:21:29.546
Yeah. I hope so.

200
00:21:30.548 --> 00:21:34.718
Okay. Who's up for a
weenie roast? You?

201
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.887
You? You?

202
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.226
I know you are.
All right.

203
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.315
Got it?
Hey.

204
00:21:48.399 --> 00:21:49.899
Scooch, scooch, scooch.

205
00:21:56.991 --> 00:21:59.117
Yay!

206
00:22:05.333 --> 00:22:08.835
All right, guys. I just want to say
sorry for the mix-up out there.

207
00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:11.171
I know things could have
turned out really bad,

208
00:22:11.255 --> 00:22:14.257
but I'm glad we're all okay.

209
00:22:14.342 --> 00:22:16.551
Don't worry about it, dude. It
could have happened to anyone.

210
00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:20.013
It's fine. We're all fine. We'll
go to the cabin in the morning.

211
00:22:20.097 --> 00:22:21.931
I think the weather should
be clear by then.

212
00:22:22.016 --> 00:22:23.516
Let's just try to get some rest.

213
00:22:23.601 --> 00:22:26.811
No way! Î—ave you seen this place?
It's fucking fantastic.

214
00:22:27.938 --> 00:22:29.731
Let's check it out. Do
a little exploring.

215
00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:31.900
Î¤respassing?

216
00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.570
God, Daniel.

217
00:22:37.782 --> 00:22:39.699
Wow.

218
00:22:39.784 --> 00:22:41.600
- All right. All right.
I'll go with you.

219
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.327
- Yeah, me too.

220
00:22:43.371 --> 00:22:45.080
You girls gonna be okay alone?

221
00:22:45.164 --> 00:22:47.707
- Don't get lost again.
- Thanks.

222
00:22:47.792 --> 00:22:51.753
Wait. You expect us girls
to cook dinner?

223
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:57.592
It's hot dogs.
I think you ladies can handle that.

224
00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.719
Well, maybe I don't want to.

225
00:22:59.804 --> 00:23:03.515
Î¤hat's right, Bridget. You
don't do hot dogs, do ya?

226
00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:06.101
Fuck you, Vincent.

227
00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:09.729
Let's go.

228
00:23:09.814 --> 00:23:12.857
Wait. I'll go with
you. Yeah, me too.

229
00:23:16.112 --> 00:23:18.613
Î—ey, wait up. I'm coming too.

230
00:23:20.658 --> 00:23:22.826
Wake up.

231
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:26.454
Î—ey, check this out.

232
00:23:26.539 --> 00:23:28.665
It looks like somebody's
been here recently.

233
00:23:28.749 --> 00:23:32.460
Î—unters probably use this to hold
up in during the spring runoff.

234
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:39.551
Do you guys think anyone would
actually be here right now?

235
00:23:39.635 --> 00:23:41.928
I mean, that would
be really creepy.

236
00:23:42.012 --> 00:23:44.806
No. No one's hunting
in this weather.

237
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.309
Ax murderers do.

238
00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.731
Just saying.

239
00:23:56.819 --> 00:24:00.363
Î—ey, this must be the
head honcho's office.

240
00:24:01.365 --> 00:24:04.117
"Dr. Brendan Ryan, Chief of Staff."

241
00:24:04.201 --> 00:24:07.412
Well, let's see if the chief
had any good stuff.

242
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.460
Oh. What the hell happened in here?

243
00:24:18.174 --> 00:24:20.467
Î—ey, check out this coat
and stethoscope.

244
00:24:20.551 --> 00:24:23.219
Î—ey, Jenna, hop on my desk. We're
gonna do a porn scene.

245
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.931
Oh, God. Me doctor, you nurse.
Vince, you mind? Do her.

246
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.311
I'm busy with my patients.
Hey! Î—ey! Get away from me!

247
00:24:31.395 --> 00:24:34.147
So, Miss Perrin.

248
00:24:34.231 --> 00:24:37.358
Î—ow long have you been having
these reoccurring nightmares?

249
00:24:37.443 --> 00:24:39.486
Well, it all started when I was 12.

250
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.821
l-l felt this presence
in my room at night.

251
00:24:41.906 --> 00:24:44.449
Was this about the time
of your first period?

252
00:24:44.533 --> 00:24:46.534
You're a fucking pervert.
You know that?

253
00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:50.497
Violent dreams are a direct result
of menstruation in young women.

254
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:56.961
Î—ad you masturbated yet? Ew!
You're fucking disgusting.

255
00:24:57.046 --> 00:24:59.589
Oh! Jackpot.

256
00:24:59.673 --> 00:25:02.842
Looks like the good doctor was
a boozer. Anyone for a snort?

257
00:25:02.927 --> 00:25:04.844
Please tell me you're
not gonna drink that.

258
00:25:04.929 --> 00:25:06.596
It's a 30-year-old
bottle of scotch.

259
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.432
Î¤hirty years ago, Jenna. Unopened.

260
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.940
Mmm. Î¤hat is smooth.
Î¤o pussy.

261
00:25:17.024 --> 00:25:19.317
Ooh!

262
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:26.324
Î—oly shit. What?
Î¤hat's some fucked-up shit.

263
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.119
What the fuck is that?
A person.

264
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.999
What the hell happened to him?
Born that way. Poor son of a bitch.

265
00:25:35.084 --> 00:25:38.002
Oh! That is so wrong.

266
00:25:42.258 --> 00:25:45.426
- Jesus!
- What was this place?

267
00:25:45.511 --> 00:25:48.263
According to the records, it was
the Glenville Sanatorium.

268
00:25:48.347 --> 00:25:50.280
- Isn't that where crazy
people are locked up?

269
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.432
- No, that's a sanitarium.

270
00:25:51.517 --> 00:25:53.640
A sanatorium is a hospital that
isolates sick people from

271
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.896
the rest of the population.
What was wrong with these people?

272
00:25:56.981 --> 00:25:59.232
I don't know.

273
00:25:59.316 --> 00:26:01.609
Î¤hey're all deformed from
what I can tell.

274
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.155
I'm gonna take some of
these and read them.

275
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.865
I just hope it wasn't contagious.

276
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.119
All right. Come on. We should
get back to the others.

277
00:26:11.203 --> 00:26:12.704
Yeah.

278
00:26:14.164 --> 00:26:16.291
That's a great idea.

279
00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:31.014
He's kind of cute when
you're stoned.

280
00:26:32.349 --> 00:26:34.434
You know, in like an
E. T. kind of way.

281
00:26:38.355 --> 00:26:40.023
Wow, babe.

282
00:26:40.107 --> 00:26:43.318
You know, you're a lot more fucked
up than I thought you were.

283
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.697
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

284
00:26:47.781 --> 00:26:50.575
Î—ey, I found a patient ward
that's got beds and shit.

285
00:26:50.659 --> 00:26:53.620
Oh, gross. I don't want to sleep
on a filthy mattress.

286
00:26:53.704 --> 00:26:55.538
We'll lay our sleeping
bags over the top.

287
00:26:55.623 --> 00:26:58.080
It's better than sleeping
on the hard floor. Plus, we

288
00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.085
get a little privacy.
Ooh. Okay.

289
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.257
We'll be back, guys.
All right. Night. So long.

290
00:27:12.556 --> 00:27:14.140
Hey.

291
00:27:14.224 --> 00:27:17.560
- You wanna come check it out?
- Sure.

292
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.981
I'm not enough?
Ah, you are mine.

293
00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.011
See? It's not so bad.
Okay.

294
00:27:52.096 --> 00:27:54.972
Okay, I say we all pick a room.

295
00:27:55.057 --> 00:27:57.141
And then everyone puts
their keys in a bowl,

296
00:27:57.226 --> 00:27:59.644
and we pick to see who
sleeps with who.

297
00:27:59.728 --> 00:28:02.438
You just don't stop, do you?
It's what I do best.

298
00:28:02.523 --> 00:28:04.857
You got that right.

299
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:13.574
Hey! I think I just saw somebody.
Ghosts. Awesome.

300
00:28:13.659 --> 00:28:16.285
No, it wasn't a ghost. I
think it was a person.

301
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.079
Well, there's nobody there now.

302
00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:20.623
If you want me to take
a look, I will.

303
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.299
No. Nobody here.
Whew.

304
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.640
Oh, my God.
Vincent?

305
00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:41.018
Î¤his isn't funny, Vincent!

306
00:28:43.147 --> 00:28:45.314
Vincent, answer me!

307
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.486
I'm going. Î¤his isn't
cool. No. No, no, no!

308
00:28:50.571 --> 00:28:53.531
No! Don't leave me alone. Come.

309
00:29:08.505 --> 00:29:10.006
Vincent.

310
00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:20.183
Vincent.

311
00:29:23.729 --> 00:29:25.271
Vincent?

312
00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.782
Whoa!
You fucking asshole!

313
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.952
Calm down. Trying to have some fun.
Oh, I can't believe you!

314
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.540
God! He's such a jerk.
Ohh!

315
00:29:45.542 --> 00:29:47.084
Kenia?

316
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.607
Move! Hey, what's up?
He's a fucking jerk.

317
00:30:09.691 --> 00:30:12.819
I scared the piss out of them.
You should have seen it.

318
00:30:12.903 --> 00:30:16.280
You have the mentality of a 1
0-year-old. You know that, right?

319
00:30:16.365 --> 00:30:19.116
- Okay.
- I could have fallen in the dark.

320
00:30:19.201 --> 00:30:21.661
You have no idea of
the consequences...

321
00:30:21.745 --> 00:30:23.746
of your stupid, incessant pranks.

322
00:30:25.749 --> 00:30:30.419
Well, a place this big has gotta
have its own generator.

323
00:30:30.504 --> 00:30:32.338
And since you two are
afraid of the dark,

324
00:30:32.422 --> 00:30:34.882
I'll see if I can find it and get
some heat and lights started.

325
00:30:34.967 --> 00:30:36.551
Finally, you're doing
something useful.

326
00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:39.637
Hey, Vincent can be useful in
many ways, can't you, baby?

327
00:30:39.721 --> 00:30:42.723
Don't go bragging now,
babe. Ciao, kiddies.

328
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.689
You doing okay?
Okay. That good, huh?

329
00:31:12.087 --> 00:31:14.338
We got gas.

330
00:31:32.608 --> 00:31:34.650
Let's see if you'll run.

331
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:47.455
Î—ey. Î—ey, hey!
See? I told you he was useful.

332
00:31:49.333 --> 00:31:50.833
Sometimes.

333
00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.470
Î—appy now?
Yes. Thank you so much.

334
00:32:04.181 --> 00:32:07.160
All right. Well, let's go
have some fun 'cause I found

335
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.894
some really cool shit.
Î¥eah!

336
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.649
All right. Come.
Ohh!

337
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:30.122
â™ª There's a new voice in my head â™ª
â™ª Monsters underneath my bed â™ª

338
00:32:30.207 --> 00:32:32.792
Whoo!

339
00:32:32.876 --> 00:32:34.669
â™ª Î¤hings happen when
you go too far â™ª

340
00:32:34.753 --> 00:32:36.629
Whoo-hoo! â™ª So play one
time and push me down â™ª

341
00:32:36.713 --> 00:32:38.839
â™ª I put your flowers
on the ground â™ª

342
00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:47.306
â™ª And here he comes again â™ª
â™ª Ohh, ohh, ohh â™ª

343
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:55.982
â™ª He never had no mercy for me â™ª
â™ª He never had no mercy for me â™ª

344
00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:04.323
â™ª He never had no mercy for me â™ª
â™ª He never had no mercy for me â™ª

345
00:33:12.082 --> 00:33:14.041
â™ª There's a voice inside my head â™ª

346
00:33:14.126 --> 00:33:16.502
â™ª Monsters underneath
my bed â™ª Yeah! Wow!

347
00:33:16.586 --> 00:33:19.630
Go, go! Let's go!

348
00:33:20.757 --> 00:33:22.591
â™ª So play one time
and push me down â™ª

349
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:27.013
â™ª I put your flowers on the ground â™ª
â™ª And here he comes again â™ª

350
00:33:27.097 --> 00:33:29.140
â™ª And here he comes
again â™ª The winner!

351
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:33.185
â™ª And here he comes again â™ª
Oh, go, go, go! â™ª Ohh, ohh, ohh â™ª

352
00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:45.489
â™ª He never had no mercy for me â™ª

353
00:33:45.574 --> 00:33:49.910
Î¤urn right! Î¤urn right! â™ª Î—e
never had no mercy for me â™ªâ™ª

354
00:33:49.995 --> 00:33:51.454
Go!

355
00:33:56.376 --> 00:33:58.919
I got it. I got it.

356
00:34:04.593 --> 00:34:06.302
Whoo!

357
00:34:06.386 --> 00:34:10.264
Î¤his place is amazing. Î¤he freaks
had their own auditorium.

358
00:34:10.348 --> 00:34:12.767
Can you imagine those guys up there
putting on their own play?

359
00:34:14.811 --> 00:34:17.521
It gives a whole new meaning
to the term freak show.

360
00:34:17.606 --> 00:34:20.024
Yeah, I bet everyone was a variation
of the Elephant Man.

361
00:34:20.108 --> 00:34:23.110
Hey, they watched movies here.

362
00:34:23.195 --> 00:34:26.155
Hey, let me see that.
Okay, movie time.

363
00:34:29.117 --> 00:34:32.328
Shall I fire it up? Yeah!

364
00:34:32.412 --> 00:34:35.498
- Who's up for popcorn?
- Whoo!

365
00:34:35.582 --> 00:34:37.541
Fine. Yeah.

366
00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:15.579
Î¤hey're just creepy.

367
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.961
I think it's kind of sad.
I wonder what happened to them.

368
00:35:22.045 --> 00:35:23.212
Î¥eah.

369
00:35:25.006 --> 00:35:26.507
You know?

370
00:35:28.385 --> 00:35:29.885
I remember this place now.

371
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:33.639
My brother used to scare the shit out
of me when I was a little girl...

372
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:38.144
with stories about the hillbillies.
What stories?

373
00:35:38.228 --> 00:35:40.729
He said there was a bunch of inbred
West Virginia hillbillies...

374
00:35:40.814 --> 00:35:42.398
that got rounded up way back when-

375
00:35:42.482 --> 00:35:46.777
Ew! and locked up in
this old hospital.

376
00:35:46.862 --> 00:35:49.446
Oh, my God. They're deformed 'cause
they kept on screwing each other.

377
00:35:49.531 --> 00:35:50.739
Ew!

378
00:35:50.824 --> 00:35:52.908
He said that's not all they
did to each other.

379
00:35:52.993 --> 00:35:54.535
What else?

380
00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:57.496
He said they ate each
other. Cannibals.

381
00:35:57.581 --> 00:35:59.039
- Are you serious?
- That's bullshit.

382
00:35:59.124 --> 00:36:00.958
- Yeah, right.
- That's an urban legend.

383
00:36:01.042 --> 00:36:04.628
He'd tell me the stories every time
we drove through Greenbrier County.

384
00:36:09.259 --> 00:36:11.552
Show's over, folks.

385
00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:16.390
Yeah. I don't know about you
guys, but I am going to bed.

386
00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:18.601
Lauren?

387
00:36:18.685 --> 00:36:20.519
Î—ey, Jenna? Wanna go?
That's a good idea.

388
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.481
Yeah, for some nightmares.
Let's go, baby. Bedtime.

389
00:36:24.566 --> 00:36:28.444
Î—ey, who wants to run the stairs
with me in the morning? Anyone?

390
00:36:28.528 --> 00:36:30.863
Wake and exercise? I
think I'll sleep in.

391
00:36:30.947 --> 00:36:33.574
Us too.

392
00:36:42.459 --> 00:36:45.085
What are you doing?

393
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.671
I can't sleep. I'm
gonna go explore.

394
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:52.176
Okay. Don't go fucking with anybody.
Î¤hey're asleep and it's so not cool.

395
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.636
I get it. I won't.

396
00:36:56.181 --> 00:36:58.140
I promise. Mmm.

397
00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:37.281
Î—ey, you! Who's there?

398
00:38:39.534 --> 00:38:41.744
You better not be playing
with me, dude!

399
00:38:41.828 --> 00:38:44.079
I'll beat the shit out of you!

400
00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:56.008
Porter, is that you?

401
00:38:57.218 --> 00:38:59.136
Porter, when did you get here?

402
00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.889
Î—oly shit. You scared the
hell out of me, man.

403
00:39:04.893 --> 00:39:06.894
Î¤his place is great, isn't it?

404
00:39:08.063 --> 00:39:11.774
Dude, what are you doing? Let's go.

405
00:39:16.363 --> 00:39:18.447
Dude, are you asleep?

406
00:39:23.203 --> 00:39:25.120
Holy fuck!

407
00:40:26.975 --> 00:40:28.600
Vincent?

408
00:40:34.232 --> 00:40:36.442
Great. We're almost out of weed.

409
00:40:36.526 --> 00:40:39.027
Well, that's 'cause you smoked
it all last night.

410
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:44.783
Where's my shirt? I don't know.
Here. Thank you.

411
00:40:44.868 --> 00:40:46.452
You're welcome.

412
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.460
Î—ey, have you seen Vincent?
No. No?

413
00:40:54.544 --> 00:40:58.380
Î—e went exploring last night,
and I can't find him.

414
00:40:58.465 --> 00:40:59.965
You haven't seen him
since last night?

415
00:41:00.049 --> 00:41:02.551
No. Oh.

416
00:41:02.635 --> 00:41:04.970
Well, he's got to be around
here somewhere. I know.

417
00:41:05.054 --> 00:41:07.181
I'll help you look. Thanks.

418
00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:10.309
Î¤his place is so huge.
He could be anywhere.

419
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.396
Yeah.
Hey, guys, have you seen Vincent?

420
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.484
Not since last night, no. No.
No? Ohh.

421
00:41:18.568 --> 00:41:20.569
We're, uh- We're looking
for Vincent.

422
00:41:20.653 --> 00:41:22.196
Haven't seen him.

423
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.323
I wouldn't worry about it, guys.
We're not going anywhere.

424
00:41:24.407 --> 00:41:26.658
Î—ave you seen it out there?
It's snowing like crazy.

425
00:41:28.411 --> 00:41:31.288
Hey, Sara, have you
seen Vincent? Yes.

426
00:41:31.372 --> 00:41:35.626
Really? Where is he? I saw him last
night doing his peeping tom bit.

427
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.920
Î—e was watching me and Bridget.

428
00:41:38.004 --> 00:41:40.720
What about this morning? No,
I haven't seen him. I've been

429
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.884
running for the last hour.
Let's eat. Breakfast anyone?

430
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.262
Mm-hmm. We'll grab our stuff.
What about Vincent? He'll show up.

431
00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:52.809
I'll meet you guys down there.
Seriously. Go to hell.

432
00:41:55.647 --> 00:41:58.273
Î—ey, where did all our shit go?

433
00:41:59.943 --> 00:42:01.652
Vincent's probably trying
to mess with us, bro.

434
00:42:01.736 --> 00:42:04.029
Don't worry about it. Just throw
some wood on the fire.

435
00:42:04.113 --> 00:42:06.031
Jesus. It's bad out there.

436
00:42:06.115 --> 00:42:09.076
Guys, do you think we should wait
for the storm to blow over?

437
00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:14.206
No. Look, I say we pack up, we find
Vincent, and we get going.

438
00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.375
Yeah. Let's split up into
two groups though.

439
00:42:16.459 --> 00:42:19.836
Daniel, you take Bridget, Sara and
Lauren and check the upper floors.

440
00:42:19.921 --> 00:42:21.920
Everyone else come with me.
We'll check the first

441
00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:22.881
floor and the basement.

442
00:42:22.966 --> 00:42:24.716
We'll meet up in the auditorium
in half an hour.

443
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.596
I'm- I'm not done eating.
Kyle, come on. Geez.

444
00:42:29.681 --> 00:42:31.974
Does anyone not think it's
weird our stuff is gone?

445
00:42:32.058 --> 00:42:34.309
You guys, the sooner we find him,
the quicker we can leave.

446
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.439
Let's go.
Î—ere you go, princess.

447
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:44.319
I'm a princess. Thanks.
You think it's funny?

448
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.741
Oh, wait! Yes.
Let's move it.

449
00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.081
Yeah. He's dead for sure.
Shut up, Kyle.

450
00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.085
Come on, Vincent!
Vincent, we've got food!

451
00:43:00.169 --> 00:43:03.171
Vince! I really don't
like this anymore.

452
00:43:07.468 --> 00:43:09.052
What is that?

453
00:43:11.222 --> 00:43:16.476
Oh, what is all this? Wow.

454
00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:20.772
Well, we're definitely
checking this out.

455
00:43:33.286 --> 00:43:35.454
Wow. Whoa.

456
00:43:43.546 --> 00:43:45.422
So, I guess if you didn't
follow the program,

457
00:43:45.506 --> 00:43:49.051
they had some serious slice
and dice- Get out of here!

458
00:43:49.135 --> 00:43:50.969
We're looking for Vincent,
remember?

459
00:43:51.054 --> 00:43:54.890
Yes. Yeah. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

460
00:43:54.974 --> 00:43:57.434
Quit goofing around. Let's
get out of here.

461
00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:06.443
Ward "C." Open the door.
Let's check this out.

462
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.414
Î¤hey locked them up like animals.
Î¤hey look like animals.

463
00:44:19.499 --> 00:44:21.792
Come on. Let's keep moving.

464
00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:28.382
What's that?
It looks like a nurse's station.

465
00:44:30.134 --> 00:44:32.080
Vincent definitely would have
checked to see if there were

466
00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.389
any drugs left behind.
Yeah, probably.

467
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:45.524
It's blood.
Oh, my God.

468
00:44:45.608 --> 00:44:47.943
All right, stay here, okay?
I'm gonna check it out.

469
00:44:50.738 --> 00:44:52.698
Do you think it's Vincent's?

470
00:44:56.244 --> 00:45:02.040
Uh, I mean, he-he- he could have
cut himself on something.

471
00:45:02.125 --> 00:45:04.084
Vince?

472
00:45:06.629 --> 00:45:10.924
Well, I say we each take a hallway.
We can cover more ground that way.

473
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.554
Mm-hmm. Sounds good to me.
Î¤his way?

474
00:45:15.638 --> 00:45:18.265
I guess we're going this
way. I guess so.

475
00:45:37.994 --> 00:45:39.494
Vincent?

476
00:47:18.928 --> 00:47:20.720
I'm really starting to get worried.

477
00:47:20.805 --> 00:47:23.557
Î—e'll show up. I'm sure he just
fell asleep somewhere.

478
00:47:23.641 --> 00:47:25.308
He smoked pretty heavy last night.

479
00:47:25.393 --> 00:47:27.160
He's probably stoned right
now, in a corner having

480
00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.980
a bad trip somewhere.
Yeah. Hey.

481
00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:36.736
Did you guys find anything? Yeah.
What? A small amount of blood.

482
00:47:36.821 --> 00:47:40.031
We are not alone here.
What do you mean?

483
00:47:40.116 --> 00:47:41.741
Somebody is fucking with us.

484
00:47:41.826 --> 00:47:43.827
What? I wanna get the
hell outta here now.

485
00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:47.998
They're gonna kill us all!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

486
00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:55.338
Î¤hat looks like Porter's jacket.
Î¤hat is Porter's jacket.

487
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.992
Hang on!
Claire!

488
00:48:31.208 --> 00:48:32.959
Claire! Claire!

489
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:37.547
Help! Claire!

490
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.057
Don't look up! Î—old on!
Claire!

491
00:48:47.141 --> 00:48:48.808
Claire, hold on!

492
00:48:50.478 --> 00:48:53.229
Oh, God! Claire!

493
00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:05.075
Come on! Come on!
The fucking door's locked! It's locked!

494
00:49:12.041 --> 00:49:13.375
Girls, come on!

495
00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:38.441
Hurry!

496
00:49:47.743 --> 00:49:50.370
Oh, my God! Shit!

497
00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:53.415
- It won't start!
- Neither will mine!

498
00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:58.044
Shit.
Î¤hey've stripped the spark plug wires.

499
00:50:01.007 --> 00:50:01.680
- Mine too.

500
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.967
- Î¤hey sabotaged the
fucking snowmobiles!

501
00:50:04.051 --> 00:50:05.677
What are we gonna do now?

502
00:50:05.761 --> 00:50:07.762
We won't last on foot
in this storm.

503
00:50:07.847 --> 00:50:09.264
We don't even have fucking jackets.

504
00:50:09.348 --> 00:50:12.434
I say we go back inside and figure
out a way to defend ourselves.

505
00:50:12.518 --> 00:50:15.160
Who the fuck are they? The
cannibal hillbillies my

506
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.522
brother told me about.
Who else could it be?

507
00:50:17.606 --> 00:50:20.483
- What are you doing?
- I'm going for help.

508
00:50:20.568 --> 00:50:23.445
Baby, you'll freeze to death.

509
00:50:23.529 --> 00:50:26.573
I'm the strongest skier.
I've got the gear.

510
00:50:26.657 --> 00:50:29.325
I'll make it down the mountain,
and I'll call the police.

511
00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:32.454
Baby, I really don't think
you should go. I'm going.

512
00:50:32.538 --> 00:50:34.998
If anybody can make
it, it's Lauren.

513
00:50:35.082 --> 00:50:37.459
I'll come back for you.
Okay? I promise.

514
00:50:40.087 --> 00:50:41.588
Be careful.

515
00:50:42.965 --> 00:50:44.632
What are we gonna do?

516
00:50:49.722 --> 00:50:51.222
I'll see you soon.

517
00:51:05.905 --> 00:51:08.323
And now what?

518
00:51:08.407 --> 00:51:11.785
Please, Sara, please! We
can't go back in there.

519
00:51:11.869 --> 00:51:13.369
We have to. No.

520
00:51:13.454 --> 00:51:16.539
Î¤he doctor's office- It has a
sturdy door and a lock on it.

521
00:51:16.624 --> 00:51:18.583
All right, it's right
near the entrance.

522
00:51:18.667 --> 00:51:19.640
- I can't do that.

523
00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.836
- We either freeze to
death or we fight.

524
00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:24.464
Î¤hat's the plan.

525
00:51:39.188 --> 00:51:40.688
Okay.

526
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:44.943
We have to get weapons.
I've got mine.

527
00:51:45.027 --> 00:51:46.611
Î¤he rest of us need them too.

528
00:51:46.695 --> 00:51:49.155
Î¤his is crazy. We need to
get the hell out of here!

529
00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.699
As soon as the storm breaks,
that's what we're gonna do.

530
00:51:51.784 --> 00:51:53.785
Guys? Guys, look at this.

531
00:51:53.869 --> 00:51:55.870
Î¤his is the guy that attacked
Claire on the balcony.

532
00:51:55.955 --> 00:51:59.624
It says they were violent, mentally,
physically deformed...

533
00:51:59.708 --> 00:52:02.001
and showed signs of cannibalism.

534
00:52:04.088 --> 00:52:06.589
How did they survive out
here? They're hunters.

535
00:52:06.674 --> 00:52:08.299
And now they're hunting us.
They'll eat anything.

536
00:52:08.384 --> 00:52:10.468
Fuck! Î¤hey probably turned Porter
into porterhouse by now.

537
00:52:10.553 --> 00:52:11.719
Just shut up!

538
00:52:48.299 --> 00:52:49.799
Î¤he basement.

539
00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.306
That cage thing. What?
Yes. Yes.

540
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:59.309
Î¤hat cage downstairs with all
the knives and saws in it.

541
00:52:59.393 --> 00:53:01.561
We should all go together.
No, I don't think so.

542
00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:03.271
Let's just stay here
until help comes.

543
00:53:03.355 --> 00:53:06.316
Look, how about you girls stay
here. Daniel and I will go.

544
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.859
You lock the door behind us. Whoa!

545
00:53:07.943 --> 00:53:09.819
Î¤hanks for volunteering
me. We need to do this.

546
00:53:09.904 --> 00:53:12.530
l-l just think we should all go
together. Strength in numbers.

547
00:53:12.615 --> 00:53:14.282
You seriously gonna
chicken out on me?

548
00:53:15.367 --> 00:53:17.994
Fine.

549
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.041
Fine. I'll go. Good.
I'll go with you. No. Don't.

550
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.794
I'll be fine. You stay here with Kenia.
Sara, please. Don't.

551
00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:30.256
I'll be right back before you know it.
Okay?

552
00:53:34.345 --> 00:53:35.845
Ready, guys?

553
00:53:36.764 --> 00:53:38.473
Ready as I'll ever be.

554
00:53:42.478 --> 00:53:43.978
Lock the door.

555
00:54:02.331 --> 00:54:04.749
It's not much further. It's
just up here to the left.

556
00:54:04.833 --> 00:54:07.126
What the fuck was that?

557
00:54:09.213 --> 00:54:10.713
Run!

558
00:54:10.798 --> 00:54:13.675
Let's just fight him! He's
got a fucking ax!

559
00:54:13.759 --> 00:54:15.260
Just run!

560
00:54:16.971 --> 00:54:18.763
Over here.

561
00:54:18.847 --> 00:54:21.891
Î—e's coming. Let's kill
him. Kill the lights.

562
00:54:57.803 --> 00:55:00.221
Kyle? Is that you?

563
00:55:10.274 --> 00:55:13.026
Sara? Daniel? Is that you?

564
00:55:24.705 --> 00:55:26.289
Help me!

565
00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.294
Î—e won't let go!

566
00:55:34.173 --> 00:55:35.757
Help me!

567
00:55:44.183 --> 00:55:47.727
Go away, you motherfucker!

568
00:55:55.736 --> 00:55:57.195
He's going away.

569
00:55:57.279 --> 00:56:00.948
Don't open the door. We gotta
get back to the others.

570
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.537
Fuck him.
If he comes back, we'll kill him.

571
00:56:10.125 --> 00:56:12.835
Come on. Come on!

572
00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.347
Shh!

573
00:56:27.643 --> 00:56:30.186
It's clear. Let's go.

574
00:56:41.657 --> 00:56:43.574
Sweet.

575
00:57:05.597 --> 00:57:09.350
Let me go, you fucking freaks!

576
00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:25.116
Kenia? It's us. Are you okay?
What the fuck happened? Hurry!

577
00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:28.786
Open up! Open up!
Yeah.

578
00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.331
Where's Daniel?
He was right behind me.

579
00:57:32.416 --> 00:57:34.542
We have to go back for
him. No, no, no!

580
00:57:34.626 --> 00:57:36.794
It's dangerous out there.
They could have got him.

581
00:57:36.879 --> 00:57:39.881
Open the door. We'll just
see if he fell behind.

582
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:46.095
Daniel? Daniel?
I don't see him.

583
00:57:50.392 --> 00:57:52.602
Okay, we gotta figure out what to do.

584
00:57:57.107 --> 00:58:00.234
No! No! No! Oh!

585
00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:20.546
Oh, God! God, somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

586
00:58:20.631 --> 00:58:22.465
I stabbed him in the
arm, and he left.

587
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:24.842
Shh! Did you hear that?

588
00:58:24.927 --> 00:58:27.512
It's Daniel. We've gotta help
him. What are we waiting for?

589
00:58:27.596 --> 00:58:29.096
Listen!

590
00:58:30.057 --> 00:58:31.933
Fuck you!

591
00:58:39.149 --> 00:58:40.650
Help-

592
00:58:43.654 --> 00:58:45.655
Î—e's probably dead already.

593
00:58:45.739 --> 00:58:47.782
I'm not gonna leave him
out there if he isn't.

594
00:58:47.866 --> 00:58:49.575
Listen! We have to have a plan...

595
00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.036
if we're gonna get out of here
alive, and I have one.

596
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.913
Does it include leaving
Daniel to die?

597
00:58:53.997 --> 00:58:55.915
If they have Daniel already,
Bridget's probably right.

598
00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:57.875
But if he's hiding, we need
to be organized...

599
00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:00.294
and have a plan to capture
these freaks. How?

600
00:59:00.379 --> 00:59:03.506
Aaah! Oh! Oh! No, no!

601
00:59:12.641 --> 00:59:15.017
What the fuck are you doing?

602
00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:51.095
Î¤hat's him. Let's go. No!
It could be a trap.

603
00:59:51.179 --> 00:59:54.515
- What?
- It could be a trap.

604
00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.268
Somebody help me!

605
00:59:57.352 --> 01:00:00.438
Î¤hey have him, and he's the bait
to get to the rest of us.

606
01:00:00.522 --> 01:00:03.107
She is right. Why else would
they keep him alive?

607
01:00:12.534 --> 01:00:15.786
I don't care if she's right. I agree
with Kyle and Sara, okay?

608
01:00:15.871 --> 01:00:19.081
We can't leave him to die. Just a
minute ago, you said not to go.

609
01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:22.251
Yeah, that's when I thought he was
dead. Now I know he's alive.

610
01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.797
Fine. I say we vote.
What?

611
01:00:40.062 --> 01:00:42.521
Î¤hose who want to stay,
raise your hand.

612
01:00:45.067 --> 01:00:46.901
Î¤hose who want to go.

613
01:00:49.363 --> 01:00:50.821
Fine. Let's go.

614
01:00:52.866 --> 01:00:55.409
What do you got? Here.

615
01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.007
Come on. Come on. You ready?
Come on.

616
01:01:13.345 --> 01:01:15.012
He's in the basement.

617
01:01:15.097 --> 01:01:17.223
What the hell are they
doing to him?

618
01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.780
God! God, let me- Let me die.
God, let me die!

619
01:01:48.547 --> 01:01:51.215
Wait! Wait! Think what's
down there.

620
01:01:51.299 --> 01:01:54.343
Uh, the cell ward "C"? The
kitchen and cell ward "C."

621
01:01:54.428 --> 01:01:56.762
I'll go check it out.
You come back to us.

622
01:01:57.472 --> 01:01:58.973
Done.

623
01:02:17.117 --> 01:02:19.118
Mmm!

624
01:02:53.779 --> 01:02:57.531
Oh, God.

625
01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.384
Oh, God.
God, let me-

626
01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:02.638
I'm sorry. God, let me die!
God, please-

627
01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.257
Where is he?
Î—e's in the fucking kitchen.

628
01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:40.301
Î¤hey strapped him to a table.
It was fucking horrible.

629
01:04:41.303 --> 01:04:42.761
What?

630
01:04:42.846 --> 01:04:46.223
Î¤hey're stripping pieces
of flesh off of Daniel.

631
01:04:46.308 --> 01:04:49.143
Î¤hey're boiling it in oil,
and they're eating him.

632
01:04:49.227 --> 01:04:53.188
Î¤hey're eating him alive like
some fucked-up fondue.

633
01:04:53.273 --> 01:04:54.773
Oh, my God.

634
01:05:00.697 --> 01:05:02.156
Î—ow many are in there?

635
01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.618
Î¤here's three. Î¤here's one big
guy and two small guys.

636
01:05:05.702 --> 01:05:08.240
Jenna, you take that. You
go down the hall to the

637
01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.496
juncture with Ward "C."

638
01:05:09.581 --> 01:05:11.999
We'll force them out the back
door of the kitchen.

639
01:05:12.083 --> 01:05:14.710
When they come to you, you
throw the lamp. Okay?

640
01:05:14.794 --> 01:05:18.047
Î¤hey're gonna have no choice but to
go down to the cell ward. Okay.

641
01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:23.636
Are you ready? Let's fucking go.
Ready? Let's go!

642
01:06:04.386 --> 01:06:07.346
Come on!

643
01:06:31.746 --> 01:06:33.247
Let's kill them.

644
01:06:33.331 --> 01:06:36.667
Yes. Let's do it. Wait. We
can't just kill them.

645
01:06:36.751 --> 01:06:38.293
What? Why the fuck not?

646
01:06:38.378 --> 01:06:40.160
Î¤hey killed our friends,
and they were gonna kill

647
01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.548
us and fuckin' eat us.
Yeah, we're not them.

648
01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:47.094
Fuck that! Hey, you. Look at me.
Look at me.

649
01:06:47.178 --> 01:06:48.762
Fuck you, you motherfuckers!

650
01:06:48.847 --> 01:06:51.098
I'm gonna cut your fucking hearts
out! You understand that?

651
01:06:52.767 --> 01:06:54.351
Go get the other kerosene lantern.

652
01:06:54.436 --> 01:06:56.437
We're gonna roast these
fuckers alive.

653
01:07:56.498 --> 01:07:58.290
Î¤ime for a barbecue, fuckers.

654
01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:06.131
Kyle, don't do this.
Î¤hey deserve it. Yeah, they do,

655
01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:10.135
but you don't.
Don't do this to yourself.

656
01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.929
Give me that lighter.

657
01:08:15.517 --> 01:08:17.017
Give me the lighter.

658
01:08:28.363 --> 01:08:31.156
Okay. What the hell are
we gonna do now?

659
01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:34.618
We find the spark plug wires,
and we leave in the morning,

660
01:08:34.702 --> 01:08:36.537
storm or no storm.

661
01:08:40.291 --> 01:08:43.460
Where are the spark plug wires?

662
01:08:50.218 --> 01:08:53.428
The bastards can't even talk.

663
01:08:54.556 --> 01:08:57.307
Fine. Then we search. Room by room.

664
01:08:57.392 --> 01:08:59.393
Okay. But somebody
has to watch them.

665
01:09:00.228 --> 01:09:02.271
I will.

666
01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:06.525
I won't touch a fucking hair
on their head. Okay?

667
01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.569
Okay.
Go look for the wires.

668
01:09:08.653 --> 01:09:10.654
Send someone back in a couple
hours to relieve me.

669
01:09:10.738 --> 01:09:12.739
We'll take shifts throughout
the night.

670
01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.466
Hey, you.
Are you hungry?

671
01:09:32.594 --> 01:09:34.428
Come on, take it.

672
01:09:42.353 --> 01:09:44.980
Fuck you, motherfucker!

673
01:09:45.064 --> 01:09:48.567
You thought I was actually
gonna feed you?

674
01:09:51.571 --> 01:09:54.781
You know I'm actually gonna kill
all three of you, don't you?

675
01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:58.911
I will.
I'm gonna say I forgot something,

676
01:09:58.995 --> 01:10:00.787
and then I'm gonna come back,

677
01:10:00.872 --> 01:10:05.918
and I'm gonna kill each and
every one of you freaks.

678
01:10:06.961 --> 01:10:08.962
Just sleep tight.

679
01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:32.778
Î¤here's nothing here.
Guys, this place is so big,

680
01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:35.197
we're never gonna find them.

681
01:10:35.281 --> 01:10:37.157
I say we pick another room
and keep looking.

682
01:10:37.242 --> 01:10:38.867
No. We need our strength.

683
01:10:38.952 --> 01:10:41.161
If we look all night, we're gonna
be no good for tomorrow.

684
01:10:41.246 --> 01:10:44.581
Yeah, but if we can't find the spark
plug wires we can't leave.

685
01:10:44.666 --> 01:10:46.416
I'm walking out of here at dawn.

686
01:10:46.501 --> 01:10:50.337
Let's head up to the doctor's office
and bed down for the night.

687
01:10:51.214 --> 01:10:52.839
I'll take the next watch.

688
01:12:33.191 --> 01:12:34.858
Where are you going?

689
01:12:36.444 --> 01:12:38.278
I'm gonna relieve Kyle
of his shift.

690
01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.827
Be careful.
I will. You too.

691
01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:52.709
You want to lock it after me?
I got it.

692
01:12:53.878 --> 01:12:55.545
Okay.

693
01:13:23.991 --> 01:13:26.827
Oh, God.

694
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.001
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.

695
01:13:43.094 --> 01:13:46.721
It's only the generator.
It's only the generator.

696
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:58.150
Oh, God!

697
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.629
Kyle?
Fuck.

698
01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.261
Kyle?

699
01:14:29.056 --> 01:14:31.558
Oh, shit! Shit.

700
01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:36.938
It's Kenia! Hurry! Let me in!
Come on, hurry!

701
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.276
Come on. Come on. What happened?
Gone. Gone?

702
01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.069
Î¤he three freaks, they're gone.

703
01:14:43.154 --> 01:14:45.363
And Kyle? He's gone too.
There's no sign of him.

704
01:14:45.448 --> 01:14:47.240
What? Do you think
Kyle killed them?

705
01:14:47.325 --> 01:14:49.868
No. Wouldn't he be here
right now if he did?

706
01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:51.786
Okay, we have to get
out of here now.

707
01:14:51.871 --> 01:14:54.623
We stay barricaded in until morning,
and then we make a run for it.

708
01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.418
Everyone agree?
Okay, if we make it till then.

709
01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.264
Did you hear that? Yes.
I'm gonna go check it out.

710
01:15:12.934 --> 01:15:14.601
Don't get too close.

711
01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:29.407
- Who is it?
- It's the small one.

712
01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:40.544
Î—e's unarmed. Let's
fucking kill him.

713
01:15:40.628 --> 01:15:42.254
Î¤his is strange. This
could be a trap.

714
01:15:42.338 --> 01:15:44.548
Î¤he other two could be around the
corner. But what if they're not?

715
01:15:44.632 --> 01:15:47.133
We can kill one right now
and improve our odds.

716
01:15:47.218 --> 01:15:48.760
Let's fucking kill him!

717
01:15:50.596 --> 01:15:52.973
Î¤here are four of us, and there's
one of him. Let's fucking do it.

718
01:15:53.057 --> 01:15:54.516
Yeah.

719
01:15:55.685 --> 01:15:57.143
All right.

720
01:15:58.437 --> 01:16:01.064
Okay, but we go as a group, and
we come right back here.

721
01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:03.817
You ready? Yes.
Let's go.

722
01:16:17.999 --> 01:16:20.292
You fuckin' pervert, die!

723
01:16:21.627 --> 01:16:24.963
Die! Die, motherfucker!

724
01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:52.324
Oh, no! No, please, no! No, no, no!
Why didn't he say anything?

725
01:16:54.285 --> 01:16:56.453
Because the bastards
cut his tongue out.

726
01:16:58.539 --> 01:17:00.999
We gotta get back!

727
01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.063
We're trapped in here.
Î¤hey're coming! Upstairs, quick!

728
01:17:23.147 --> 01:17:25.523
Go. We'll hide in the attic. Go!

729
01:17:50.299 --> 01:17:51.841
Î¤his is where they live.

730
01:17:51.926 --> 01:17:54.052
And where they'll come back
to. Let's get out of here.

731
01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:55.804
Yeah, now.

732
01:17:57.056 --> 01:17:58.640
Look, coats. Grab some gear.

733
01:17:58.724 --> 01:18:01.726
No, I'm not putting those clothes
on. Oh, yes, you are.

734
01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:03.895
We can survive in these. Take this.

735
01:18:05.272 --> 01:18:06.606
Hurry! Let's go.

736
01:18:06.691 --> 01:18:09.609
Î—ead down to the main floor. See
if we can find a way out.

737
01:18:14.198 --> 01:18:16.533
We've got to find a way
to lock ourselves in.

738
01:18:16.617 --> 01:18:19.285
Here. Î—ere. Go.

739
01:18:24.875 --> 01:18:27.711
Î¤here. Î¤hat should keep
them out for a while.

740
01:18:27.795 --> 01:18:30.088
We need to find a way
to get out of here.

741
01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:33.883
We have to climb out a window.
Okay. Okay.

742
01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:40.557
Grates. We're fucked.
They can't all be grated.

743
01:18:40.641 --> 01:18:43.309
Î¤o keep the freaks in?
You bet they all are.

744
01:18:48.107 --> 01:18:50.316
Î—ey, everyone. Come here. What?

745
01:18:55.239 --> 01:18:57.657
Î¤he grate has rusted
out. Give me a hand.

746
01:18:57.742 --> 01:19:00.160
Careful.

747
01:19:06.834 --> 01:19:09.043
Shit!

748
01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:15.216
The fuckers are at the door.
Hurry!

749
01:19:15.301 --> 01:19:16.801
Stand back.

750
01:19:25.770 --> 01:19:28.813
I'll dig a hole. You guys follow.

751
01:19:41.619 --> 01:19:43.328
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

752
01:20:04.183 --> 01:20:05.683
Hurry!

753
01:20:18.781 --> 01:20:20.907
I'm out.

754
01:20:21.909 --> 01:20:24.452
You're next. Get going. Okay.

755
01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.718
Get going. I'll be right behind.
Clear!

756
01:20:47.685 --> 01:20:49.894
Come on, Kenia! Come
on! Hurry! Hurry!

757
01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:57.193
I'm clear! Come on, Jenna. Hurry!
Now!

758
01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:16.754
Jenna, can you hear me?
Hold my ankles.

759
01:21:28.642 --> 01:21:31.811
Get me out of here!

760
01:21:35.858 --> 01:21:38.318
Jenna? Jenna? No.

761
01:21:40.529 --> 01:21:42.822
Come on! We gotta get going!

762
01:21:57.004 --> 01:21:59.923
Come on! Come on! Get
up! We have to go!

763
01:22:00.007 --> 01:22:02.550
Come on! We've gotta keep going!

764
01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:07.680
Follow me. Stay close.
Come on!

765
01:22:12.853 --> 01:22:14.771
We've got to move quicker! Run!

766
01:22:22.112 --> 01:22:25.740
Î¤hey got our snowmobiles.
Move! Move!

767
01:22:39.171 --> 01:22:40.964
Keep going!

768
01:22:42.925 --> 01:22:45.093
Go away!

769
01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:48.846
Please! Go away!

770
01:22:52.309 --> 01:22:53.685
No!

771
01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.155
Where are they going?
Who cares? Come on!

772
01:23:08.742 --> 01:23:10.243
Can you stop?

773
01:23:10.327 --> 01:23:12.954
I dropped the fireplace poker.
I gotta go back and find it.

774
01:23:13.038 --> 01:23:15.748
We don't have time for that. It's
a good weapon. We need it.

775
01:23:15.833 --> 01:23:18.209
Stay with Bridget, okay?
I've gotta go back.

776
01:23:28.846 --> 01:23:30.763
Come on! Come on!

777
01:23:34.101 --> 01:23:36.269
Oh, God.

778
01:23:37.938 --> 01:23:39.647
They're coming in both
directions. What?

779
01:23:39.732 --> 01:23:41.649
I don't see any lights.
They turned them off.

780
01:23:41.734 --> 01:23:45.111
Get down and hide. Get down.

781
01:23:45.195 --> 01:23:47.989
I can't do this. I can't
do this. Get down.

782
01:23:48.073 --> 01:23:49.574
I can't do it.

783
01:23:51.452 --> 01:23:53.453
Bridget!

784
01:24:05.299 --> 01:24:07.258
No!

785
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:16.017
Kenia? How bad is it?
I don't know. It fucking hurts.

786
01:24:16.101 --> 01:24:18.728
Come on. Come on. They got Bridget.

787
01:24:18.812 --> 01:24:20.646
Okay, let's get you
to the tree line.

788
01:24:20.731 --> 01:24:22.648
Î¤hen I'll go back for
her, okay? Come on.

789
01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:54.013
We've gotta get your jacket off.
Ow! Fuck.

790
01:24:55.349 --> 01:24:56.808
Just do it. You ready?

791
01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:08.319
Okay, baby.
Î¤hat should slow the bleeding.

792
01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.950
Go find her.
You'll be all right here?

793
01:25:14.034 --> 01:25:16.828
I'll be right here. Okay? Okay.

794
01:25:28.841 --> 01:25:31.759
Bridget! Where are you, Bridget?

795
01:25:40.811 --> 01:25:43.396
Hang on! Bridget, I'm coming!

796
01:26:19.474 --> 01:26:20.975
Sara?

797
01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:24.312
Bridget?

798
01:26:29.902 --> 01:26:31.110
Bridget!

799
01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:36.866
Bridget? Sara?
Sara. Sara.

800
01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:47.376
Oh, my God!
No! No! Bridget?

801
01:26:52.007 --> 01:26:54.550
Sara! Where are you?

802
01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.097
Sara!

803
01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:39.345
Oh, my God!

804
01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:53.359
Sara!
Please- Please help me!

805
01:27:53.443 --> 01:27:55.778
Anyone.

806
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:08.082
No. No!
No!

807
01:28:11.503 --> 01:28:12.586
Sara!

808
01:28:16.174 --> 01:28:18.676
Yes! It worked.

809
01:28:23.348 --> 01:28:25.016
Good job.

810
01:28:30.439 --> 01:28:32.815
Let's get the hell out of here.

811
01:28:46.496 --> 01:28:49.623
â™ª Take a bruised hip, you'll
take skinned knee â™ª

812
01:28:49.708 --> 01:28:53.085
â™ª Take a million hits
fore i ever can see â™ª

813
01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:56.172
â™ª Screamin' "Is that
all you got?" â™ª

814
01:28:56.256 --> 01:28:58.924
â™ª As I bleed â™ª

815
01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:04.847
â™ª I always come back â™ª
Whoo!

816
01:29:04.931 --> 01:29:06.098
Oh, no!

817
01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:11.145
â™ª I need you now â™ª
â™ª Don't fade away on me â™ª

818
01:29:12.773 --> 01:29:15.274
â™ª 'Cause I made a mistake â™ª

819
01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:22.156
â™ª I think I took a wrong turn â™ª
â™ª Î¤here along the way â™ª

820
01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:29.580
â™ª I sealed my fate â™ª
â™ª And all I know is you've gone â™ª

821
01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:36.253
â™ª Yeah, you're gone away â™ª
â™ª I'll never touch your face â™ª

822
01:29:36.338 --> 01:29:39.715
â™ª I'll never see you again â™ª

823
01:29:41.051 --> 01:29:44.553
â™ª And I watch each day through
the fallin' snow â™ª

824
01:29:44.638 --> 01:29:48.015
â™ª The dead men walkin' through
their highs and lows â™ª

825
01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:54.480
â™ª Wishin' they could start again â™ª
