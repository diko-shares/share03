While I'm very familiar
with you and your family,

Yes.

This is good.

that the Führer has put you in charge
of rounding up the Jews left in France

or passing for Gentile.

But the meaning of your visit,

nine months ago for hiding Jews

18
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.690
and found nothing.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.110
I'm aware of that.

I've read the reports of this area.

21
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.330
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

22
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.500
there is always a slight
duplication of efforts,

but needs to be done nevertheless.

they've either made good their escape

There've been two recent
developments regarding Operation Kino.

702
01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:55.510
One, the venue has been changed from
The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
