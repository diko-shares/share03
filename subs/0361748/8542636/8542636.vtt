00:01:55.218 --> 00:01:57.386
Chapter One
Once upon a time...

3
00:01:57.387 --> 00:02:02.891
Chapter One
Once upon a time... in Nazi-occupied France

4
00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:37.176
Pappa.

5
00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.888
Julie, get me some water
for my wash up...

6
00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:54.558
...then get inside with your sisters.

7
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.793
Ready, Papa.

8
00:03:32.138 --> 00:03:33.180
Thank you, my darling...

9
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.515
...now you go inside with your sisters.

10
00:03:40.104 --> 00:03:41.146
Don't run.

11
00:03:52.984 --> 00:03:54.984
This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?

12
00:03:54.986 --> 00:03:56.986
Yes Herr Colonel.

13
00:03:58.288 --> 00:04:00.288
Herman, until I summon you,
I am to be left alone.

14
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.290
As you wish Heer Col.

15
00:04:03.753 --> 00:04:05.879
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

16
00:04:06.297 --> 00:04:07.380
I am Perrier LaPadite.

17
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.885
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Monsieur LaPadite...

18
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.429
...I am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.

19
00:04:14.931 --> 00:04:15.972
What can I do for you?

20
00:04:16.516 --> 00:04:19.351
I was hoping you could invite me
inside your home...

21
00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:21.937
...and we may have a discussion.

22
00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:24.898
Certainly. After you.

23
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:36.701
Colonel Landa, this is my family.

24
00:04:46.838 --> 00:04:48.088
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS...

25
00:04:48.506 --> 00:04:49.589
...Mademoiselle...

26
00:04:49.674 --> 00:04:50.924
...at your service.

27
00:04:51.843 --> 00:04:56.054
The rumors I have heard in the
village about your family are all true.

28
00:04:59.308 --> 00:05:01.977
Each one of your daughters
is more lovely than the last.

29
00:05:03.187 --> 00:05:04.229
Merci.

30
00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:06.523
Please...

31
00:05:07.275 --> 00:05:08.316
...have a seat.

32
00:05:14.073 --> 00:05:15.949
Suzanne, would you be so good as to
get the Colonel some wine?

33
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.451
But no.

34
00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:20.912
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite,
but no wine.

35
00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:26.793
This being a dairy farm, one would be
safe in assuming you have milk?

36
00:05:26.878 --> 00:05:27.919
Oui.

37
00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:29.421
Then milk is what I prefer.

38
00:05:29.797 --> 00:05:30.881
Very well.

39
00:05:32.008 --> 00:05:33.675
Julie, would you mind closing the window?

40
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:55.113
Merci.

41
00:06:11.214 --> 00:06:15.091
Monsieur, to both your family
and your cows...

42
00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:17.844
...I say, "Bravo."

43
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:19.971
Thank you.

44
00:06:21.265 --> 00:06:24.017
Please join me at your table.

45
00:06:24.894 --> 00:06:25.936
Very well.

46
00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:32.484
Monsieur LaPadite...

47
00:06:33.277 --> 00:06:37.489
...what we have to discuss
would be better discussed in private.

48
00:06:38.824 --> 00:06:41.243
You'll notice I left my men outdoors.

49
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.249
If it wouldn't offend them, could you
ask your lovely ladies to step outside?

50
00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:50.085
You are right.

51
00:06:51.087 --> 00:06:53.255
Charlotte, would you take the girls
outside?

52
00:06:54.215 --> 00:06:55.715
The Colonel and I need to have
a few words.

53
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.937
Monsieur LaPadite...

54
00:07:10.606 --> 00:07:15.360
...I regret to inform you
I've exhausted the extent of my French.

55
00:07:16.654 --> 00:07:20.407
To continue to speak it so inadequately
would only serve to embarrass me.

56
00:07:20.658 --> 00:07:24.494
However, I've been led to believe
you speak English quite well.

57
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.871
Yes.

58
00:07:26.956 --> 00:07:31.126
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house...

59
00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:33.837
...I ask your permission to switch
to English...

60
00:07:34.005 --> 00:07:35.672
...for the remainder of the conversation.

61
00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:38.008
By all means.

62
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:41.471
While I'm very familiar
with you and your family,

63
00:07:41.555 --> 00:07:45.225
I have no way of knowing if
you are familiar with who I am.

64
00:07:46.143 --> 00:07:48.395
Are you aware
of my existence?

65
00:07:49.396 --> 00:07:50.397
Yes.

66
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.565
This is good.

67
00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:56.236
Now, are you aware of the job I've
been ordered to carry out in France?

68
00:07:58.572 --> 00:07:59.614
Yes.

69
00:08:00.282 --> 00:08:02.284
Please tell me
what you've heard.

70
00:08:03.243 --> 00:08:04.578
I've heard

71
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.416
that the Führer has put you in charge
of rounding up the Jews left in France

72
00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:12.419
who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile.

73
00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:16.757
The Führer couldn't have
said it better himself.

74
00:08:18.717 --> 00:08:22.346
But the meaning
of your visit,

75
00:08:22.804 --> 00:08:27.017
pleasant though it is,
is mysterious to me.

76
00:08:28.685 --> 00:08:31.938
The Germans looked through my house
nine months ago for hiding Jews

77
00:08:32.022 --> 00:08:33.690
and found nothing.

78
00:08:35.442 --> 00:08:37.110
I'm aware of that.

79
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:40.113
I've read the reports
of this area.

80
00:08:42.115 --> 00:08:45.327
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

81
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.497
there is always a slight
duplication of efforts,

82
00:08:49.748 --> 00:08:54.419
most of it being a complete waste of
time, but needs to be done nevertheless.

83
00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.465
I just have a few questions,
monsieur LaPadite.

84
00:08:59.966 --> 00:09:02.219
If you can assist me
with answers,

85
00:09:02.302 --> 00:09:05.430
my department can close
the file on your family.

86
00:09:13.897 --> 00:09:15.065
Now,

87
00:09:16.733 --> 00:09:20.987
before the occupation, there were
four Jewish families in this area,

88
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:23.907
all dairy farmers
like yourself.

89
00:09:25.742 --> 00:09:30.330
Doleracs, Rollins,
the Loveitts

90
00:09:32.165 --> 00:09:33.834
and the Dreyfuses.

91
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.544
Is that correct?

92
00:09:35.627 --> 00:09:36.628
To my knowledge,

93
00:09:36.712 --> 00:09:40.173
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.

94
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.177
Herr Colonel, would it disturb
you if I smoked my pipe?

95
00:09:44.261 --> 00:09:45.721
Please,
monsieur LaPadite,

96
00:09:45.804 --> 00:09:48.807
this is your house,
make yourself comfortable.

97
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:52.102
Now, according
to these papers,

98
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.440
all the Jewish families in this
area have been accounted for

99
00:09:56.523 --> 00:09:59.359
except the Dreyfuses.

100
00:10:00.819 --> 00:10:04.239
Somewhere in the last year it
would appear they've vanished.

101
00:10:04.322 --> 00:10:07.617
Which leads me to the conclusion that
they've either made good their escape

102
00:10:07.701 --> 00:10:10.620
or someone is very
successfully hiding them.

103
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.459
What have you heard about the
Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?

104
00:10:15.542 --> 00:10:16.501
Only rumors.

105
00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:17.878
I love rumors!

106
00:10:19.463 --> 00:10:20.797
Facts could be
so misleading,

107
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:24.051
where rumors, true or
false, are often revealing.

108
00:10:24.468 --> 00:10:25.927
So, monsieur LaPadite,

109
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:29.264
what rumors have you heard
regarding the Dreyfuses?

110
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.228
Again, this is just a rumor, but

111
00:10:37.212 --> 00:10:39.610
we heard the Dreyfuses

112
00:10:40.212 --> 00:10:43.212
had made their way into Spain.

113
00:10:49.493 --> 00:10:52.204
So, the rumors you've heard
have been of escape?

114
00:10:53.914 --> 00:10:54.998
Yes.

115
00:10:58.585 --> 00:11:02.339
Having never met the Dreyfuses,
would you confirm for me

116
00:11:02.422 --> 00:11:05.717
the exact members of the
household and their names?

117
00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:13.100
There were
five of them.

118
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.979
The father, Jacob.

119
00:11:19.856 --> 00:11:22.359
Wife, Miram.

120
00:11:24.403 --> 00:11:27.989
And her brother, Bob.

121
00:11:35.247 --> 00:11:36.790
How old is Bob?

122
00:11:38.417 --> 00:11:39.751
Thirty, 31.

123
00:11:44.006 --> 00:11:45.257
Continue.

124
00:11:45.632 --> 00:11:47.259
And the children,

125
00:11:48.969 --> 00:11:50.095
Amos

126
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.640
and Shosanna.

127
00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:57.644
Ages of the children?

128
00:12:04.735 --> 00:12:08.321
Amos was nine or 10.

129
00:12:11.158 --> 00:12:12.451
And Shosanna?

130
00:12:12.534 --> 00:12:14.661
And Shosanna was

131
00:12:16.329 --> 00:12:20.125
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.

132
00:12:30.969 --> 00:12:33.305
Well, I guess
that should do it.

133
00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:44.107
However, before I go, could I have
another glass of your delicious milk?

134
00:12:47.152 --> 00:12:48.653
But of course.

135
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.454
Monsieur LaPadite,

136
00:12:57.537 --> 00:13:01.541
are you aware of the nickname the
people of France have given me?

137
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.589
I have no interest
in such things.

138
00:13:08.632 --> 00:13:11.343
But you are aware
of what they call me.

139
00:13:13.887 --> 00:13:15.222
I'm aware.

140
00:13:16.973 --> 00:13:18.850
What are you aware of?

141
00:13:28.735 --> 00:13:30.278
That they call you
"The Jew Hunter. "

142
00:13:30.362 --> 00:13:31.905
Precisely.

143
00:13:34.241 --> 00:13:36.868
I understand your
trepidation in repeating it.

144
00:13:36.952 --> 00:13:39.246
Heydrich apparently
hates the moniker

145
00:13:39.329 --> 00:13:41.998
the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.

146
00:13:42.082 --> 00:13:45.335
Actually, why he would hate the
name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.

147
00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:48.755
It would appear he has done
everything in his power to earn it.

148
00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:52.092
Now I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title

149
00:13:52.175 --> 00:13:54.594
precisely because
I've earned it.

150
00:13:56.013 --> 00:14:00.058
The feature that makes me such an
effective hunter of the Jews is,

151
00:14:00.142 --> 00:14:02.853
as opposed to most
German soldiers,

152
00:14:02.936 --> 00:14:04.938
I can think like a Jew

153
00:14:05.605 --> 00:14:08.316
where they can only
think like a German.

154
00:14:08.692 --> 00:14:11.111
More precisely,
a German soldier.

155
00:14:17.784 --> 00:14:22.748
Now, if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast,

156
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.835
it would be the cunning and the
predatory instinct of a hawk.

157
00:14:27.294 --> 00:14:31.131
But if one were to determine what
attributes the Jews share with a beast,

158
00:14:31.214 --> 00:14:33.342
it would be
that of the rat.

159
00:14:36.136 --> 00:14:39.973
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing.

160
00:14:40.057 --> 00:14:43.060
But where our conclusions
differ,

161
00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:46.146
is I don't consider
the comparison an insult.

162
00:14:48.648 --> 00:14:52.486
Consider for a moment
the world a rat lives in.

163
00:14:53.403 --> 00:14:55.614
It's a hostile world,
indeed.

164
00:14:56.448 --> 00:14:59.826
If a rat were to scamper through
your front door, right now,

165
00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.329
would you greet it
with hostility?

166
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.165
I suppose I would.

167
00:15:05.248 --> 00:15:06.792
Has a rat ever done
anything to you

168
00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:10.170
to create this animosity
you feel toward them?

169
00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:13.715
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.

170
00:15:14.257 --> 00:15:18.053
Rats were the cause of the bubonic
plague, but that's some time ago.

171
00:15:18.136 --> 00:15:20.764
I propose to you any disease
a rat could spread,

172
00:15:20.847 --> 00:15:23.308
a squirrel could
equally carry.

173
00:15:23.392 --> 00:15:24.976
Would you agree?

174
00:15:26.853 --> 00:15:29.439
Yet, I assume you don't share
the same animosity with squirrels

175
00:15:29.523 --> 00:15:31.525
that you do with rats,
do you?

176
00:15:31.608 --> 00:15:32.609
No.

177
00:15:32.693 --> 00:15:35.195
Yet, they're both rodents,
are they not?

178
00:15:35.278 --> 00:15:39.282
And except for the tail, they
even rather look alike, don't they?

179
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.536
It's an interesting thought,
Herr Colonel.

180
00:15:43.245 --> 00:15:45.288
However interesting
as the thought may be,

181
00:15:45.372 --> 00:15:48.625
it makes not one bit of
difference to how you feel.

182
00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:55.048
If a rat were to walk in
here, right now, as I'm talking

183
00:15:56.174 --> 00:16:00.012
would you greet it with a
saucer of your delicious milk?

184
00:16:00.095 --> 00:16:01.555
Probably not.

185
00:16:02.264 --> 00:16:03.932
I didn't think so.

186
00:16:04.558 --> 00:16:06.101
You don't like them.

187
00:16:06.184 --> 00:16:08.061
You don't really know
why you don't like them.

188
00:16:08.145 --> 00:16:10.897
All you know is
you find them repulsive.

189
00:16:13.108 --> 00:16:16.153
Consequently, a German
soldier conducts a search

190
00:16:16.236 --> 00:16:18.780
of a house suspected
of hiding Jews.

191
00:16:19.698 --> 00:16:21.283
Where does the hawk look?

192
00:16:21.366 --> 00:16:24.536
He looks in the barn, he looks in
the attic, he looks in the cellar,

193
00:16:24.619 --> 00:16:27.080
he looks everywhere
he would hide.

194
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.210
But there are so many places it
would never occur to a hawk to hide.

195
00:16:34.463 --> 00:16:38.133
However, the reason the Führer has
brought me off my Alps in Austria

196
00:16:38.216 --> 00:16:42.637
and placed me in French cow country
today is because it does occur to me.

197
00:16:43.889 --> 00:16:47.225
Because I'm aware what tremendous
feats human beings are capable of

198
00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:49.353
once they abandon dignity.

199
00:16:51.104 --> 00:16:53.273
May I smoke my pipe
as well?

200
00:16:55.609 --> 00:16:58.487
Please, Herr Colonel,
make yourself at home.

201
00:17:11.249 --> 00:17:16.296
Now, my job dictates

202
00:17:21.635 --> 00:17:24.304
that I must have my men
enter your home

203
00:17:28.225 --> 00:17:30.102
and conduct
a thorough search

204
00:17:30.185 --> 00:17:33.980
before I can officially cross
your family's name off my list.

205
00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:38.610
And if there are any irregularities
to be found, rest assured they will be.

206
00:17:38.694 --> 00:17:40.904
That is unless you have
something to tell me

207
00:17:40.987 --> 00:17:44.032
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.

208
00:17:44.116 --> 00:17:46.368
I might add, also,
that any information

209
00:17:46.451 --> 00:17:51.123
that makes the performance of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.

210
00:17:51.957 --> 00:17:55.502
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.

211
00:17:56.003 --> 00:17:57.295
And that reward will be,

212
00:17:57.379 --> 00:18:00.173
your family will cease
to be harassed in any way

213
00:18:00.257 --> 00:18:04.678
by the German military during the
rest of our occupation of your country.

214
00:18:15.355 --> 00:18:18.692
You're sheltering enemies
of the state, are you not?

215
00:18:24.031 --> 00:18:25.115
Yes.

216
00:18:28.035 --> 00:18:31.955
You're sheltering them underneath
your floorboards, aren't you?

217
00:18:34.499 --> 00:18:35.542
Yes.

218
00:18:38.378 --> 00:18:41.423
Point out to me the areas
where they're hiding.

219
00:19:02.444 --> 00:19:03.820
Since I haven't heard
any disturbance,

220
00:19:03.904 --> 00:19:07.616
I assume, while they're listening,
they don't speak English.

221
00:19:09.534 --> 00:19:10.577
Yes.

222
00:19:12.662 --> 00:19:15.499
I'm going to switch back to French now,
and I want you to follow my masquerade.

223
00:19:15.582 --> 00:19:17.042
Is that clear?

224
00:19:19.002 --> 00:19:20.087
Yes.

225
00:19:22.045 --> 00:19:23.129
Monsieur LaPadite...

226
00:19:25.507 --> 00:19:28.259
...I thank you for the milk...

227
00:19:30.178 --> 00:19:31.262
...and your hospitality.

228
00:19:34.016 --> 00:19:35.975
I do believe our business here is done.

229
00:19:41.023 --> 00:19:42.231
Ah, ladies.

230
00:19:45.402 --> 00:19:48.487
I thank you for your time.

231
00:19:51.033 --> 00:19:52.700
We shan't be bothering your family
any longer.

232
00:19:53.744 --> 00:19:54.785
So, Monsieur...

233
00:19:55.829 --> 00:19:56.871
...Mademoiselle.

234
00:19:57.372 --> 00:20:00.207
I bid farewell to you and say...

235
00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:01.834
...adieu.

236
00:20:22.024 --> 00:20:23.150
It's the girl.

237
00:21:09.404 --> 00:21:11.948
Au revoir, Shosanna!

238
00:21:27.381 --> 00:21:28.757
Ten-hut!

239
00:21:35.639 --> 00:21:37.516
My name is
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.

240
00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:41.561
And I'm putting together a special
team, and I need me eight soldiers.

241
00:21:41.645 --> 00:21:44.773
Eight Jewish
American soldiers.

242
00:21:45.524 --> 00:21:49.319
Now, you all might've heard rumors
about the Armada happening soon.

243
00:21:49.403 --> 00:21:52.114
Well, we'll be leaving
a little earlier.

244
00:21:53.323 --> 00:21:56.618
We're going to be dropped into
France dressed as civilians.

245
00:21:57.244 --> 00:21:59.538
Once we're
in enemy territory,

246
00:22:00.163 --> 00:22:02.124
as a bushwhacking
guerrilla army,

247
00:22:02.207 --> 00:22:05.585
we're going to be doing one
thing and one thing only.

248
00:22:06.128 --> 00:22:07.587
Killing Nazis.

249
00:22:09.589 --> 00:22:11.174
I don't know
about you all,

250
00:22:11.258 --> 00:22:14.177
but I sure as hell didn't come down
from the goddamn Smoky Mountains,

251
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:18.181
cross 5,000 miles of water,
fight my way through half of Sicily

252
00:22:18.265 --> 00:22:22.686
and jump out of a fucking airplane to
teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.

253
00:22:22.769 --> 00:22:24.855
Nazi ain't got no humanity.

254
00:22:25.605 --> 00:22:29.109
They're the foot soldiers of a
Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac

255
00:22:29.192 --> 00:22:31.445
and they need
to be destroyed.

256
00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.158
That's why any and every son of a
bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform,

257
00:22:36.616 --> 00:22:38.452
they're going to die.

258
00:22:41.413 --> 00:22:44.833
Now, I'm the direct descendent
of the mountain man Jim Bridger.

259
00:22:44.916 --> 00:22:47.044
That means I got
a little Indian in me.

260
00:22:47.127 --> 00:22:51.381
And our battle plan will be
that of an Apache resistance.

261
00:22:52.466 --> 00:22:54.801
We will be cruel
to the Germans.

262
00:22:55.177 --> 00:22:58.472
And through our cruelty,
they will know who we are.

263
00:22:58.638 --> 00:23:00.891
And they will find
the evidence of our cruelty

264
00:23:00.974 --> 00:23:02.893
in the disemboweled,
dismembered

265
00:23:02.976 --> 00:23:06.646
and disfigured bodies of their
brothers we leave behind us.

266
00:23:06.813 --> 00:23:09.232
And the German won't be able
to help themselves

267
00:23:09.316 --> 00:23:13.070
but imagine the cruelty their
brothers endured at our hands,

268
00:23:13.737 --> 00:23:17.157
and our boot heels
and the edge of our knives.

269
00:23:18.533 --> 00:23:20.911
And the German
will be sickened by us.

270
00:23:20.994 --> 00:23:23.205
And the German
will talk about us.

271
00:23:23.288 --> 00:23:25.499
And the German
will fear us.

272
00:23:25.999 --> 00:23:28.502
And when the German
closes their eyes at night

273
00:23:28.585 --> 00:23:31.880
and they're tortured by their
subconscious for the evil they have done,

274
00:23:31.963 --> 00:23:35.676
it will be with thoughts of us
that they are tortured with.

275
00:23:37.219 --> 00:23:38.387
Sound good?

276
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.097
Yes, sir!

277
00:23:41.431 --> 00:23:43.225
That's what I like to hear.

278
00:23:43.433 --> 00:23:47.270
But I got a word of warning
for all you would-be warriors.

279
00:23:47.354 --> 00:23:50.232
When you join my command,
you take on debit.

280
00:23:50.649 --> 00:23:53.235
A debit you owe me,
personally.

281
00:23:55.237 --> 00:23:59.825
Each and every man under my
command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.

282
00:24:00.534 --> 00:24:02.369
And I want my scalps.

283
00:24:03.245 --> 00:24:08.458
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps
taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.

284
00:24:10.043 --> 00:24:11.962
Or you will die trying!

285
00:24:12.502 --> 00:24:12.668
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

286
00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:14.295
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

287
00:24:14.838 --> 00:24:18.424
How much more of these Jew swine
must I endure?

288
00:24:19.968 --> 00:24:21.885
They butcher my men like they were flies!

289
00:24:23.138 --> 00:24:29.143
Do you know the latest rumor they've conjured
up in their fear-induced delirium?

290
00:24:29.436 --> 00:24:30.519
The one...

291
00:24:30.729 --> 00:24:33.814
...that beats my boys with a bat!

292
00:24:34.024 --> 00:24:36.984
The one they call "The Bear Jew"...

293
00:24:37.277 --> 00:24:38.319
...is a Golem!

294
00:24:38.695 --> 00:24:40.487
My Führer, this is just soldiers' gossip.

295
00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:46.160
No one really believes "The Bear Jew"
is a Golem.

296
00:24:46.453 --> 00:24:47.536
Why not?

297
00:24:47.746 --> 00:24:50.789
They seem to be able to elude capture
like an apparition.

298
00:24:52.667 --> 00:24:55.419
They seem to be able to appear and
disappear at will.

299
00:24:56.629 --> 00:24:59.798
You want to prove they're flesh and blood?

300
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.301
Then bring them to me!

301
00:25:04.137 --> 00:25:08.140
I will hang them naked, by their heels,
from the Eiffel Tower!

302
00:25:08.975 --> 00:25:12.311
And then throw their bodies in the sewers...

303
00:25:12.645 --> 00:25:15.939
...for the rats of Paris to feast!

304
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:21.612
Kliest!

305
00:25:21.821 --> 00:25:22.905
Yes, my Führer!

306
00:25:23.448 --> 00:25:28.452
I have an order I want relayed to all
German soldiers stationed in France.

307
00:25:29.496 --> 00:25:36.335
The Jew degenerate known as "The Bear Jew," henceforth,
is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again.

308
00:25:36.711 --> 00:25:37.753
Yes, my Führer!

309
00:25:38.046 --> 00:25:40.339
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?

310
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.466
Who and what is a Private Butz?

311
00:25:42.717 --> 00:25:45.135
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.

312
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.056
His squad was ambushed by Lt. Raine's Jews.

313
00:25:49.307 --> 00:25:51.016
He was its only survivor.

314
00:25:51.309 --> 00:25:54.645
Indeed, I do want to see him.
Thank you for reminding me.

315
00:25:54.813 --> 00:25:55.896
Send him in.

316
00:26:06.825 --> 00:26:12.037
Sergeant Rachtmann, Ludwig and I were the
only ones left alive after the ambush.

317
00:26:13.581 --> 00:26:17.501
While one man guarded us,
the rest removed the hair.

318
00:26:54.082 --> 00:26:55.751
Hey, Hirschberg.

319
00:26:56.501 --> 00:26:58.211
Send that Kraut
sarge over.

320
00:26:58.295 --> 00:26:59.796
You. Go.

321
00:27:33.538 --> 00:27:35.582
Sergeant
Werner Rachtman.

322
00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:39.086
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.

323
00:27:39.628 --> 00:27:41.672
You know what
"sit down" means, Werner?

324
00:27:41.755 --> 00:27:43.548
Yes.
Then sit down.

325
00:27:47.219 --> 00:27:48.303
How is your English,
Werner?

326
00:27:48.387 --> 00:27:51.348
Because if need be, we got a
couple of fellows who can translate.

327
00:27:51.431 --> 00:27:52.516
Wicki here,

328
00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:55.852
an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out
of Munich while the getting was good.

329
00:27:55.936 --> 00:27:59.856
Became American, got drafted,
come back to give y'all what for.

330
00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:03.026
Another one up there
you might be familiar with.

331
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.028
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.

332
00:28:07.114 --> 00:28:08.615
Heard of him?

333
00:28:08.949 --> 00:28:12.619
Everybody in the German Army
has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.

334
00:28:23.296 --> 00:28:25.257
The reason
for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity

335
00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.467
among German soldiers
is simple.

336
00:28:27.551 --> 00:28:33.223
As a German-enlisted man,
he killed 13 Gestapo officers.

337
00:28:47.487 --> 00:28:50.490
Instead of putting him up
against a wall,

338
00:28:50.574 --> 00:28:53.410
the High Command decided
to send him back to Berlin

339
00:28:53.493 --> 00:28:54.995
to be made an example of.

340
00:28:56.538 --> 00:29:00.292
Needless to say, once the
Basterds heard about him,

341
00:29:00.625 --> 00:29:02.294
he never got there.

342
00:29:39.206 --> 00:29:41.083
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?

343
00:29:43.752 --> 00:29:46.463
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.

344
00:29:46.546 --> 00:29:48.215
Ever heard of us?

345
00:29:50.217 --> 00:29:52.803
We just want to say we're
a big fan of your work.

346
00:29:52.886 --> 00:29:54.012
When it comes
to killing Nazis...

347
00:29:57.265 --> 00:29:59.518
...I think you show
great talent.

348
00:29:59.601 --> 00:30:03.397
And I pride myself for having
an eye for that kind of talent.

349
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.070
But your status as a Nazi
killer is stilI amateur.

350
00:30:11.154 --> 00:30:14.157
We all come here to see
if you want to go pro.

351
00:30:20.998 --> 00:30:23.291
Can I assume
you know who we are?

352
00:30:23.375 --> 00:30:24.710
You're Aldo the Apache.

353
00:30:27.129 --> 00:30:28.547
Werner,
if you heard of us,

354
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.299
you probably heard we ain't in
the prisoner-taking business.

355
00:30:31.383 --> 00:30:35.303
We in the killing Nazi business,
and, cousin, business is a-booming.

356
00:30:35.387 --> 00:30:36.680
Oh, yeah.

357
00:30:37.264 --> 00:30:39.808
Now, that leaves two ways
we can play this out.

358
00:30:39.891 --> 00:30:42.102
Either kill you
or let you go.

359
00:30:42.644 --> 00:30:44.730
Whether or not you're going
to leave this ditch alive

360
00:30:44.813 --> 00:30:46.773
depends entirely on you.

361
00:30:51.111 --> 00:30:53.864
Up the road a piece,
there's an orchard.

362
00:30:54.281 --> 00:30:58.702
Besides you, we know there's another
Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.

363
00:30:59.578 --> 00:31:01.705
If that patrol were
to have any crack shots,

364
00:31:01.788 --> 00:31:04.750
that orchard would be
a goddamn sniper's delight.

365
00:31:05.959 --> 00:31:09.296
So if you ever want to eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again,

366
00:31:10.714 --> 00:31:14.217
you got to show me on
this here map where they are.

367
00:31:15.093 --> 00:31:18.430
You got to tell me how many
they are, and you got to tell me

368
00:31:18.513 --> 00:31:20.974
what kind of artillery
they're carrying with them.

369
00:31:22.476 --> 00:31:26.688
You can't expect me to divulge information
that would put German lives in danger.

370
00:31:27.731 --> 00:31:31.735
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're
wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.

371
00:31:32.486 --> 00:31:34.696
I need to know about
Germans hiding in trees.

372
00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.949
And you need to tell me. And
you need to tell me right now.

373
00:31:39.159 --> 00:31:40.660
Now, just take that
finger of yours

374
00:31:40.744 --> 00:31:44.081
and point out on this here map
where this party is being held,

375
00:31:44.164 --> 00:31:47.542
how many is coming and what
they brought to play with.

376
00:31:54.675 --> 00:31:56.927
I respectfully refuse,
sir.

377
00:31:59.262 --> 00:32:00.597
Hear that?

378
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:02.974
Yes.

379
00:32:06.103 --> 00:32:08.397
That's Sergeant
Donny Donowitz.

380
00:32:08.689 --> 00:32:11.400
You might know him better
by his nickname.

381
00:32:11.483 --> 00:32:13.235
The Bear Jew.

382
00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:18.323
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache,
you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.

383
00:32:18.407 --> 00:32:19.658
I heard of The Bear Jew.

384
00:32:19.741 --> 00:32:21.368
What did you hear?

385
00:32:22.452 --> 00:32:24.871
Beats German soldiers
with a club.

386
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:29.042
He bashes their brains in with
a baseball bat, what he does.

387
00:32:29.376 --> 00:32:31.461
And, Werner, I'm going to
ask you one last goddamn time,

388
00:32:31.545 --> 00:32:33.422
and if you still
respectfully refuse,

389
00:32:33.505 --> 00:32:35.549
I'm calling
The Bear Jew over.

390
00:32:35.632 --> 00:32:37.551
He's going to take
that big bat of his,

391
00:32:37.634 --> 00:32:40.804
and he's going to beat
your ass to death with it.

392
00:32:44.099 --> 00:32:45.934
Now, take your
Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger,

393
00:32:46.018 --> 00:32:49.021
and point out on this map
what I want to know.

394
00:32:57.112 --> 00:32:58.405
Fuck you.

395
00:32:58.864 --> 00:33:00.490
And your Jew dogs.

396
00:33:04.453 --> 00:33:06.413
Actually, Werner, we're all
tickled to hear you say that.

397
00:33:06.496 --> 00:33:08.373
Quite frankly, watching
Donny beat Nazis to death

398
00:33:08.457 --> 00:33:11.335
is the closest we ever get
to going to the movies. Donny!

399
00:33:11.418 --> 00:33:12.544
Yeah?

400
00:33:12.627 --> 00:33:15.172
Got us a German here who
wants to die for country.

401
00:33:15.255 --> 00:33:16.590
Oblige him.

402
00:34:23.156 --> 00:34:25.659
Did you get that
for killing Jews?

403
00:34:25.826 --> 00:34:27.119
Bravery.

404
00:34:43.677 --> 00:34:44.803
Yeah!

405
00:34:47.431 --> 00:34:49.766
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

406
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:51.018
Donny!

407
00:34:51.601 --> 00:34:52.769
Yeah, Donny!

408
00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.772
About now I'd be shitting
my pants if I was you.

409
00:34:57.274 --> 00:34:59.943
Teddy Fucking Williams
knocks it out of the park!

410
00:35:00.027 --> 00:35:03.613
Fenway Park is on its feet
for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!

411
00:35:03.697 --> 00:35:07.617
He went yard on that one,
on to fucking Lansdowne Street!

412
00:35:07.701 --> 00:35:08.785
You!

413
00:35:11.955 --> 00:35:13.707
Damn it,
Hirschberg!

414
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.710
Donny, bring that other one
over here. Alive!

415
00:35:17.002 --> 00:35:19.921
Get the fuck up! Batter
up. You're on deck!

416
00:35:20.213 --> 00:35:22.924
Two hits. I hit you,
you hit the ground.

417
00:35:23.967 --> 00:35:25.135
English?

418
00:35:26.261 --> 00:35:27.429
Wicki.

419
00:35:31.058 --> 00:35:33.018
Ask him
if he wants to live.

420
00:35:35.312 --> 00:35:37.564
Tell him to point out on
this map the German position.

421
00:35:42.486 --> 00:35:44.112
Ask him how many Germans.

422
00:35:46.573 --> 00:35:48.200
Around about 12.

423
00:35:48.367 --> 00:35:49.743
What kind of artillery?

424
00:35:55.705 --> 00:35:57.914
How did you survive this ordeal?

425
00:35:59.709 --> 00:36:00.750
They let me go.

426
00:36:01.505 --> 00:36:03.090
Now, when you report
what happened here,

427
00:36:03.173 --> 00:36:06.843
you can't tell them you told us
what you told us. They'll shoot you.

428
00:36:06.927 --> 00:36:10.847
They're going to want to know why
you so special, we let you live.

429
00:36:10.931 --> 00:36:14.601
So tell them, we let you live so you
could spread the word through the ranks

430
00:36:14.685 --> 00:36:17.145
what's going to happen
to every Nazi we find.

431
00:36:17.852 --> 00:36:22.063
You are not to tell anybody anything.
Not one word of detail!

432
00:36:23.607 --> 00:36:25.900
Your outfit was ambushed, and you got away!

433
00:36:26.402 --> 00:36:27.777
Not one word more!

434
00:36:29.113 --> 00:36:30.196
Yes, my Führer.

435
00:36:33.284 --> 00:36:36.119
Did they mark you like they did
the other survivors?

436
00:36:37.538 --> 00:36:38.621
Yes, my Führer.

437
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.963
Now that you've survived the war, when
you get home, what you going to do?

438
00:36:46.255 --> 00:36:48.715
I will hug my mother like
I've never hugged her before.

439
00:36:49.094 --> 00:36:51.304
He's going
to hug his mother.

440
00:36:53.473 --> 00:36:55.225
Well, ain't that nice?

441
00:36:55.434 --> 00:36:57.144
Ask if he's going
to take off his uniform.

442
00:36:59.643 --> 00:37:01.811
Not only shall I remove it,
but I intend to burn it.

443
00:37:02.232 --> 00:37:04.109
He's going
to burn it.

444
00:37:04.401 --> 00:37:07.112
Yeah, that's what we
thought. We don't like that.

445
00:37:08.155 --> 00:37:12.075
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.

446
00:37:12.159 --> 00:37:13.702
Just like that.

447
00:37:18.332 --> 00:37:22.586
But you take off that uniform, ain't
nobody going to know you's a Nazi.

448
00:37:22.669 --> 00:37:24.838
And that don't sit
well with us.

449
00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:33.513
So I'm going to give you a little
something you can't take off.

450
00:37:45.692 --> 00:37:49.363
You know, Lieutenant, you're
getting pretty good at that.

451
00:37:49.821 --> 00:37:52.991
You know how you get to
Carnegie Hall, don't you?

452
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.202
Practice.

453
00:39:03.559 --> 00:39:04.767
What starts tomorrow?

454
00:39:07.563 --> 00:39:09.189
A Max Linder festival.

455
00:39:11.192 --> 00:39:12.942
I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.

456
00:39:14.403 --> 00:39:17.030
Except Linder never made a film
as good as "The Kid."

457
00:39:17.781 --> 00:39:20.116
The chase climax of "The Kid," superb.

458
00:39:27.082 --> 00:39:28.458
I adore your cinema very much.

459
00:39:29.793 --> 00:39:30.877
Merci.

460
00:39:31.754 --> 00:39:32.795
Is it yours?

461
00:39:34.548 --> 00:39:35.548
Do I own it?

462
00:39:35.633 --> 00:39:36.758
Oui.

463
00:39:37.301 --> 00:39:38.384
Oui.

464
00:39:40.763 --> 00:39:43.431
How is it a girl as young as you
owns a cinema?

465
00:39:43.974 --> 00:39:45.391
My aunt left it to me.

466
00:39:46.602 --> 00:39:48.478
Merci for hosting a German night.

467
00:39:49.897 --> 00:39:50.980
I don't have a choice...

468
00:39:51.649 --> 00:39:52.649
...but you're welcome.

469
00:39:53.609 --> 00:39:55.610
I love the Riefenstahl mountain films...

470
00:39:55.986 --> 00:39:56.986
...especially Piz Palü.

471
00:39:58.322 --> 00:40:00.657
It's nice to see a French girl
who's an admirer of Riefenstahl.

472
00:40:01.283 --> 00:40:03.159
"Admire" would not really be
the word I would use...

473
00:40:03.452 --> 00:40:06.120
...to describe my feelings towards
Fräulein Riefenstahl.

474
00:40:08.332 --> 00:40:10.333
But you do admire the director Pabst,
don't you?

475
00:40:12.294 --> 00:40:13.962
That's why you include his name
on the marquee...

476
00:40:14.964 --> 00:40:16.047
...when you didn't have to.

477
00:40:23.889 --> 00:40:28.226
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.

478
00:40:29.061 --> 00:40:30.228
Even Germans.

479
00:40:30.521 --> 00:40:31.688
Even Germans, oui.

480
00:40:33.023 --> 00:40:34.691
Merci for your assistance, soldier.
Adieu.

481
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:37.902
You're not finished.

482
00:40:38.529 --> 00:40:39.696
I'll finish in the morning.

483
00:40:39.989 --> 00:40:41.197
May I ask your name?

484
00:40:44.034 --> 00:40:45.034
You wish to see my papers?

485
00:41:00.217 --> 00:41:01.217
Emmanuelle Mimieux.

486
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.012
That's a very pretty name.

487
00:41:05.222 --> 00:41:06.222
Merci.

488
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:07.598
Are you finished with my papers?

489
00:41:11.895 --> 00:41:13.604
Mademoiselle, may I introduce myself...

490
00:41:14.565 --> 00:41:15.773
...Fredrick Zoller.

491
00:41:23.282 --> 00:41:24.365
Well...

492
00:41:25.701 --> 00:41:29.579
...it's been a pleasure chatting
with a fellow cinema lover.

493
00:41:30.956 --> 00:41:32.040
Sweet dreams, mademoiselle.

494
00:41:32.875 --> 00:41:33.916
Adieu.

495
00:42:14.958 --> 00:42:15.958
Hello, mademoiselle.

496
00:42:17.086 --> 00:42:18.127
May I join you?

497
00:42:19.421 --> 00:42:20.463
Look, Fredrick...

498
00:42:21.965 --> 00:42:22.965
You remember my name?

499
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.300
Yes.

500
00:42:25.469 --> 00:42:28.137
Look, you seem a
pleasant enough fellow...

501
00:42:28.263 --> 00:42:29.305
Thank you.

502
00:42:29.515 --> 00:42:30.598
You're welcome.

503
00:42:31.141 --> 00:42:32.683
Regardless, I want you
to stop pestering me.

504
00:42:36.271 --> 00:42:37.980
I apologize, mademoiselle...

505
00:42:38.649 --> 00:42:39.857
...I wasn't trying to be a pest.

506
00:42:40.984 --> 00:42:42.485
I was simply trying to be friendly.

507
00:42:43.612 --> 00:42:44.695
I don't wish to be your friend.

508
00:42:46.281 --> 00:42:47.323
Why not?

509
00:42:49.368 --> 00:42:50.827
Don't act like an infant. You know why.

510
00:42:53.497 --> 00:42:54.997
I'm more than just a uniform.

511
00:42:55.457 --> 00:42:56.499
Not to me.

512
00:42:57.167 --> 00:42:59.293
If you are so desperate
for a French girlfriend...

513
00:43:00.045 --> 00:43:01.462
...I suggest you try Vichy.

514
00:43:33.662 --> 00:43:34.704
Who are you?

515
00:43:35.747 --> 00:43:36.998
I thought I was just a uniform.

516
00:43:37.749 --> 00:43:39.250
You're not just a German soldier.

517
00:43:40.878 --> 00:43:41.919
Are you somebody's son?

518
00:43:42.754 --> 00:43:44.881
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.

519
00:44:16.955 --> 00:44:20.458
You're a very lucky girl,
catching a brave war hero.

520
00:44:20.626 --> 00:44:23.419
No, no, no, no, the
mademoiselle is not my girlfriend.

521
00:44:24.588 --> 00:44:27.089
Can you write "Amour Babette"?

522
00:44:48.111 --> 00:44:49.654
So you're a war hero.

523
00:44:51.448 --> 00:44:52.490
What did you do?

524
00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.455
I was alone in a bell tower
in a walled off city.

525
00:45:00.332 --> 00:45:02.959
It was myself and a thousand
rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest...

526
00:45:04.253 --> 00:45:06.128
...against three hundred enemy soldiers.

527
00:45:07.631 --> 00:45:08.798
What's a bird's nest?

528
00:45:11.593 --> 00:45:14.637
A bird's nest is what a sniper
would call a bell tower.

529
00:45:15.138 --> 00:45:18.099
It's a high structure, offering a three
hundred and sixty degree view.

530
00:45:19.017 --> 00:45:21.018
Very advantageous for marksmen.

531
00:45:23.188 --> 00:45:24.480
How many did you kill?

532
00:45:26.149 --> 00:45:27.275
Sixty-eight.

533
00:45:29.486 --> 00:45:30.611
The first day.

534
00:45:32.948 --> 00:45:34.156
A hundred and fifty...

535
00:45:36.159 --> 00:45:37.159
...the second day.

536
00:45:39.997 --> 00:45:41.497
Thirty-two the third day.

537
00:45:44.042 --> 00:45:45.876
On the fourth day they exited the city.

538
00:45:48.171 --> 00:45:51.549
Naturally, my war story received a
lot of attention in Germany...

539
00:45:51.967 --> 00:45:53.509
...that's why they all recognize me.

540
00:45:54.845 --> 00:45:57.179
They call me the German Sergeant York.

541
00:45:58.515 --> 00:46:00.182
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.

542
00:46:02.644 --> 00:46:05.187
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.

543
00:46:06.023 --> 00:46:08.524
So he did and called it "Nation's Pride."

544
00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:14.238
And they wanted me to play myself...

545
00:46:15.574 --> 00:46:16.657
...so I did.

546
00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.660
Joseph thinks this movie will
be proven to be his masterpiece.

547
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:21.996
And I will be the German Van Johnson.

548
00:46:22.873 --> 00:46:24.332
"Nation's Pride" is about you?

549
00:46:26.501 --> 00:46:28.544
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?

550
00:46:28.712 --> 00:46:29.754
I know.

551
00:46:30.047 --> 00:46:31.047
Comical?

552
00:46:31.882 --> 00:46:35.217
Well, good luck with your movie, Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.

553
00:46:45.854 --> 00:46:46.896
Goodbye!

554
00:46:48.815 --> 00:46:49.815
Do you need help?

555
00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.067
No, it's okay.

556
00:46:51.234 --> 00:46:52.401
If you need me, I'll be in the
storage room.

557
00:46:52.527 --> 00:46:53.569
Okay, my love.

558
00:47:26.937 --> 00:47:27.937
Mademoiselle Mimieux?

559
00:47:30.774 --> 00:47:31.816
Yes?

560
00:47:36.113 --> 00:47:37.113
Is this your cinema?

561
00:47:37.948 --> 00:47:38.989
Yes.

562
00:47:42.786 --> 00:47:43.786
Come down!

563
00:47:47.082 --> 00:47:48.124
Please.

564
00:48:05.016 --> 00:48:06.475
I don't understand. What have I done?

565
00:48:06.643 --> 00:48:07.643
She wants to know what she's done.

566
00:48:07.978 --> 00:48:09.687
Get your ass in that car.

567
00:48:28.999 --> 00:48:34.837
It's only the offspring of slaves that allows
America to be competitive athletically.

568
00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:40.176
American Olympic gold can be
measured in Negro sweat.

569
00:48:55.025 --> 00:48:56.358
Good, you came.

570
00:48:56.985 --> 00:48:59.069
I wasn't sure whether or not
you'd accept my invitation.

571
00:49:00.071 --> 00:49:01.113
Invitation?

572
00:49:01.198 --> 00:49:02.531
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?

573
00:49:02.699 --> 00:49:03.866
Yes, it is, Dr. Goebbels.

574
00:49:04.409 --> 00:49:06.410
Emmanuelle, there is somebody
I want you to meet.

575
00:49:09.539 --> 00:49:13.709
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce
you to the minister of propaganda...

576
00:49:14.377 --> 00:49:17.046
...the leader of the entire
German film industry...

577
00:49:17.547 --> 00:49:21.383
...and now that I'm an actor, my boss,
Dr. Joseph Goebbels.

578
00:49:22.219 --> 00:49:23.677
Your reputation precedes you,
Fräulein Mimieux.

579
00:49:30.769 --> 00:49:34.063
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels'
French interpreter...

580
00:49:34.439 --> 00:49:35.606
...Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.

581
00:49:36.066 --> 00:49:37.066
Hello.

582
00:49:42.239 --> 00:49:43.280
Hello.

583
00:49:45.742 --> 00:49:47.701
And you've met the Major.

584
00:49:48.245 --> 00:49:51.580
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo.

585
00:49:52.082 --> 00:49:53.249
At your service, mademoiselle.

586
00:49:54.251 --> 00:49:55.292
Please allow me...

587
00:49:56.586 --> 00:49:57.628
...have a seat please.

588
00:50:04.135 --> 00:50:06.762
Try the champagne, mademoiselle,
it's quite good.

589
00:50:15.146 --> 00:50:19.108
I must say, Fräulein,
I should be rather annoyed with you.

590
00:50:20.443 --> 00:50:21.902
I arrive in France...

591
00:50:21.987 --> 00:50:25.281
...and I wish to have lunch with my star.

592
00:50:26.116 --> 00:50:27.116
Little do I know...

593
00:50:27.784 --> 00:50:30.119
...he's become the toast of Paris.

594
00:50:30.412 --> 00:50:34.790
And now he must find time for me.

595
00:50:37.168 --> 00:50:41.797
People wait in line hours, days to see me.

596
00:50:42.799 --> 00:50:44.967
For the Führer...

597
00:50:46.094 --> 00:50:48.304
...and Private Zoller, I wait.

598
00:50:49.472 --> 00:50:54.184
So finally, I'm granted an audience
with the young Private.

599
00:50:56.354 --> 00:50:59.815
And he spends the entire lunch speaking
of you and your cinema.

600
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:02.067
So Fräulein Mimieux,
let's get down to business.

601
00:51:02.152 --> 00:51:03.319
Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels...

602
00:51:03.445 --> 00:51:04.778
I haven't informed her yet.

603
00:51:05.322 --> 00:51:07.823
Unless the girl's a simpleton,
I'm sure she's figured it out by now.

604
00:51:08.158 --> 00:51:09.658
After all, she does operate a cinema.

605
00:51:11.161 --> 00:51:12.161
Francesca, tell her.

606
00:51:12.662 --> 00:51:15.247
What they are trying to tell you,
Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller...

607
00:51:15.332 --> 00:51:17.875
...has spent the last hour at lunch trying
to convince Monsieur Goebbels...

608
00:51:18.001 --> 00:51:20.502
...to abandon previous plans for
Private Zoller's film premiere...

609
00:51:21.004 --> 00:51:23.672
...and change the venue to your cinema.

610
00:51:24.799 --> 00:51:25.841
What?

611
00:51:26.009 --> 00:51:27.551
I wanted to inform her.

612
00:51:27.969 --> 00:51:30.888
Shit! I apologize,
Private, of course you did.

613
00:51:31.014 --> 00:51:32.181
What's the issue?

614
00:51:33.016 --> 00:51:35.851
The Private wanted to
inform the mademoiselle himself.

615
00:51:36.227 --> 00:51:37.353
Nonsense!

616
00:51:38.355 --> 00:51:40.689
Until I ask my questions,
he has nothing to inform.

617
00:51:41.483 --> 00:51:44.818
Let the record state, I have not agreed
to switch cinemas for my premiere.

618
00:51:45.654 --> 00:51:46.820
Duly noted.

619
00:51:51.826 --> 00:51:53.661
You have opera boxes?

620
00:51:54.996 --> 00:51:56.038
Yes.

621
00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.082
How many?

622
00:51:59.876 --> 00:52:01.001
Two.

623
00:52:02.504 --> 00:52:04.088
More would be better.

624
00:52:04.673 --> 00:52:07.007
How many seats in your auditorium?

625
00:52:07.592 --> 00:52:08.717
Three hundred and fifty.

626
00:52:12.389 --> 00:52:15.724
That's almost four hundred
less than The Ritz.

627
00:52:16.017 --> 00:52:17.393
But Dr. Goebbels...

628
00:52:17.894 --> 00:52:19.019
...that's not such a terrible thing.

629
00:52:19.729 --> 00:52:22.606
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge
every two-faced French bourgeois...

630
00:52:22.732 --> 00:52:23.732
...taking up space, currying favor.

631
00:52:24.401 --> 00:52:26.944
With less seats, it makes the
event more exclusive.

632
00:52:27.862 --> 00:52:30.864
You're not trying to fill the house,
they're fighting for seats.

633
00:52:31.741 --> 00:52:33.200
Besides, to hell with the French.

634
00:52:33.618 --> 00:52:37.079
This is a German night, a German event,
a German celebration.

635
00:52:38.039 --> 00:52:40.124
This night is for you, me...

636
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:42.626
...for the German military,
the high command...

637
00:52:42.752 --> 00:52:43.752
...their family and friends.

638
00:52:44.421 --> 00:52:46.130
The only people who should
be allowed in the room...

639
00:52:46.256 --> 00:52:48.590
...are people who will be moved by
the exploits on the screen.

640
00:52:58.101 --> 00:53:00.102
I see your public speaking has improved.

641
00:53:01.563 --> 00:53:03.605
It appears I've created a monster.

642
00:53:06.776 --> 00:53:09.111
A strangely persuasive monster.

643
00:53:15.285 --> 00:53:17.995
When the war is over, politics await.

644
00:53:26.463 --> 00:53:27.796
Well, Private...

645
00:53:31.301 --> 00:53:33.677
...though it is true,
I'm inclined to indulge you anything...

646
00:53:34.637 --> 00:53:38.515
I must watch a film in this young lady's
cinema before I can say, yes or no.

647
00:53:40.518 --> 00:53:46.023
So young lady, you are to close your cinema
for a private screening tonight.

648
00:53:49.986 --> 00:53:52.821
What German films do you have?

649
00:53:53.364 --> 00:53:53.405
Ah, Landa, you are here.

650
00:53:53.406 --> 00:53:54.823
Ah, Landa, you are here.

651
00:53:58.495 --> 00:54:00.662
Emmanuelle, this is Colonel Hans Landa
of the SS.

652
00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:03.290
He'll be running the security for the premiere.

653
00:54:09.005 --> 00:54:10.339
Charmed, mademoiselle.

654
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:20.145
Au revoir, Shosanna!

655
00:54:20.725 --> 00:54:24.895
And now I must get the Reich Minister
to his next appointment.

656
00:54:26.022 --> 00:54:27.523
Slave driver.

657
00:54:28.358 --> 00:54:31.527
French slave driver.

658
00:54:34.155 --> 00:54:38.867
Actually, in my role as security chief of this
joyous German occasion, I'm afraid I must...

659
00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.495
...have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.

660
00:54:42.872 --> 00:54:43.914
What sort of discussion?

661
00:54:46.042 --> 00:54:51.713
That sounded suspiciously like a Private
questioning the order of a Colonel.

662
00:54:52.048 --> 00:54:53.507
Or am I just being sensitive?

663
00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:55.676
Nothing could be further
from the truth, Colonel.

664
00:54:55.885 --> 00:54:57.219
Your authority is beyond question.

665
00:54:58.555 --> 00:54:59.888
But your reputation does precede you.

666
00:55:00.265 --> 00:55:02.391
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
or myself be concerned?

667
00:55:02.725 --> 00:55:04.726
Hans, the boy means no harm...

668
00:55:05.395 --> 00:55:06.895
...he's simply smitten.

669
00:55:07.772 --> 00:55:10.232
And he's correct. Your reputation
does precede you.

670
00:55:10.567 --> 00:55:14.403
No need for concern, you two. As
security chief, I simply need to have a chat...

671
00:55:14.529 --> 00:55:17.739
...with the possible new venue's property owner.

672
00:55:29.919 --> 00:55:31.753
Have you tried the strudel here?

673
00:55:34.424 --> 00:55:35.549
No, no.

674
00:55:35.925 --> 00:55:37.050
It's not so terrible.

675
00:55:38.928 --> 00:55:43.473
So how is it the young Private and
yourself came to be acquainted?

676
00:55:46.603 --> 00:55:49.605
Yes, two strudels. One for myself and
one for the mademoiselle.

677
00:55:50.607 --> 00:55:54.776
For me a cup of espresso
and for the mademoiselle...

678
00:55:55.111 --> 00:55:56.278
...a glass of milk.

679
00:55:59.616 --> 00:56:02.451
So, mademoiselle, you were
beginning to explain?

680
00:56:05.288 --> 00:56:09.124
Up until a couple of days ago, I had no
knowledge of Private Zoller...

681
00:56:09.792 --> 00:56:10.792
...or his exploits.

682
00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:12.961
To me...

683
00:56:13.796 --> 00:56:17.466
...the Private was simply just a
patron of my cinema. We spoke a few times but...

684
00:56:18.134 --> 00:56:20.636
Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.

685
00:56:21.471 --> 00:56:24.181
This is a simple formality.

686
00:56:24.474 --> 00:56:26.975
No reason for you to feel anxious.

687
00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:34.650
I apologize, I forgot to order the cream.

688
00:56:35.151 --> 00:56:36.318
One moment.

689
00:56:43.159 --> 00:56:44.868
Wait for the cream.

690
00:56:57.215 --> 00:57:00.676
So, Emmanuelle.
May I call you Emmanuelle?

691
00:57:01.803 --> 00:57:02.844
Oui.

692
00:57:05.974 --> 00:57:07.182
So, Emmanuelle...

693
00:57:08.518 --> 00:57:09.559
...explain to me...

694
00:57:10.186 --> 00:57:13.689
...how does it happen, that a young lady such
as yourself, comes to own a cinema?

695
00:57:26.202 --> 00:57:27.202
After you.

696
00:57:43.553 --> 00:57:44.720
Verdict?

697
00:57:45.888 --> 00:57:47.723
Like I said, not so terrible.

698
00:57:55.898 --> 00:57:58.734
You were explaining the origin
of your cinema ownership.

699
00:57:59.736 --> 00:58:03.905
The cinema originally belonged
to my aunt and uncle.

700
00:58:05.742 --> 00:58:07.075
What are their names?

701
00:58:07.452 --> 00:58:08.702
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.

702
00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:10.912
Where are they now?

703
00:58:11.873 --> 00:58:13.749
My uncle was killed during Blitzkrieg.

704
00:58:14.584 --> 00:58:15.584
Pity.

705
00:58:16.586 --> 00:58:17.711
Continue.

706
00:58:18.087 --> 00:58:21.423
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.

707
00:58:21.924 --> 00:58:23.050
Regrettable.

708
00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:27.471
It's come to my attention you have a
Negro in your employ. Is that true?

709
00:58:29.557 --> 00:58:30.599
Oui.

710
00:58:32.435 --> 00:58:33.560
He is a Frenchman.

711
00:58:34.937 --> 00:58:36.104
His name is Marcel.

712
00:58:37.774 --> 00:58:41.401
He worked with my aunt and uncle
since they opened the cinema.

713
00:58:42.612 --> 00:58:44.613
He's the only other one who works with me.

714
00:58:44.906 --> 00:58:45.947
Doing what?

715
00:58:46.157 --> 00:58:47.282
Projectionist.

716
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:49.076
Is he any good?

717
00:58:49.285 --> 00:58:50.327
The best.

718
00:58:51.954 --> 00:58:55.624
Actually, one could see where that
might be a good trade for them.

719
00:59:02.298 --> 00:59:04.758
Can you operate the projectors?

720
00:59:05.301 --> 00:59:06.468
Of course I can.

721
00:59:09.806 --> 00:59:11.807
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do...

722
00:59:12.934 --> 00:59:14.518
I'm quite positive...

723
00:59:15.478 --> 00:59:19.106
...he wouldn't want the
success or failure of his illustrious evening...

724
00:59:21.651 --> 00:59:23.318
...dependent on the prowess of a Negro.

725
00:59:24.946 --> 00:59:25.987
So...

726
00:59:26.322 --> 00:59:27.614
...if it comes to pass...

727
00:59:28.324 --> 00:59:31.326
...we hold this event at your venue...

728
00:59:32.495 --> 00:59:35.372
...talented no doubt, as your Negro may be...

729
00:59:36.791 --> 00:59:37.833
...you will...

730
00:59:38.876 --> 00:59:40.335
...operate the projectors.

731
00:59:45.341 --> 00:59:46.550
Is that acceptable?

732
00:59:47.176 --> 00:59:48.218
Oui.

733
00:59:49.804 --> 00:59:50.846
Cigarette?

734
00:59:54.016 --> 00:59:55.058
They are not French.

735
00:59:55.977 --> 00:59:57.018
They are German.

736
01:00:15.413 --> 01:00:17.247
I did have something else I wanted to ask you.

737
01:00:29.343 --> 01:00:32.387
But right now, for the life of me,
I can't remember what it is.

738
01:00:33.222 --> 01:00:35.724
Oh well, must not have been important.

739
01:00:39.896 --> 01:00:40.937
'Til tonight.

740
01:00:51.532 --> 01:00:53.867
I must say, I appreciate the modesty
of this cinema.

741
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:57.621
Your cinema has real respect, almost
church like.

742
01:00:58.414 --> 01:01:01.416
Not to say we couldn't spruce the
place up a bit.

743
01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:05.921
Maybe I'll go to the Louvre, pick up a few
Greek nudes, and scatter them about the lobby.

744
01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.091
So, Emmanuelle, how did
you like "Lucky Kids"?

745
01:01:11.636 --> 01:01:12.677
I quite like Lilian Harvey.

746
01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:15.639
Lilian Harvey!

747
01:01:16.098 --> 01:01:18.308
Never mention that name again in my presence!

748
01:01:41.666 --> 01:01:42.791
Hey...

749
01:01:42.959 --> 01:01:44.793
...what the fuck are we supposed to do?

750
01:01:47.046 --> 01:01:49.297
It looks like we're supposed
to have a Nazi premiere.

751
01:01:49.465 --> 01:01:52.968
Like I said
what the fuck are we supposed to do?

752
01:01:55.805 --> 01:01:58.473
Well, I need to talk with you about that.

753
01:02:00.476 --> 01:02:02.644
I'm confused, what are we talking about?

754
01:02:03.354 --> 01:02:06.982
Filling the cinema with Nazis
and burning it down to the ground.

755
01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:08.316
I'm not talking about that.

756
01:02:08.651 --> 01:02:09.818
You are talking about that.

757
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:11.987
No, we're talking about that, right now.

758
01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:16.491
If we can keep this place from burning
down by ourselves...

759
01:02:16.993 --> 01:02:18.827
...we can burn it down by ourselves?

760
01:02:21.414 --> 01:02:23.039
Oui Shosanna, we could do that.

761
01:02:23.332 --> 01:02:26.042
And with Madame Mimieux's
350 nitrate film print collection...

762
01:02:28.045 --> 01:02:29.337
...we wouldn't even need explosives...

763
01:02:30.339 --> 01:02:31.423
...would we?

764
01:02:32.341 --> 01:02:34.509
You mean we wouldn't
need any more explosives?

765
01:02:34.556 --> 01:02:38.935
At that time, 35 millimeter
nitrate film was so flammable

766
01:02:39.019 --> 01:02:42.064
that you couldn't even
bring a reel onto a streetcar.

767
01:02:42.272 --> 01:02:43.982
Hey, you can't bring those
here on a public vehicle.

768
01:02:44.066 --> 01:02:45.484
They're films, ain't they? Yes.

769
01:02:45.567 --> 01:02:47.235
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.

770
01:02:47.402 --> 01:02:51.239
Because nitrate film burns
three times faster than paper.

771
01:02:54.868 --> 01:02:56.912
Shosanna has a collection

772
01:02:56.995 --> 01:03:02.042
of over 350 nitrate
film prints.

773
01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.374
I am going to burn down
the cinema on Nazi night.

774
01:03:12.381 --> 01:03:13.465
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema...

775
01:03:13.883 --> 01:03:14.924
...which I am...

776
01:03:16.886 --> 01:03:19.220
...we both know, you're not
going to let me do it by myself.

777
01:03:23.392 --> 01:03:27.896
Because you love me. And I love you. And you're
the only person on this earth I can trust.

778
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:32.567
But that's not all we're going to do.

779
01:03:35.071 --> 01:03:37.072
Does the filmmaking equipment
in the attic still work?

780
01:03:37.239 --> 01:03:39.991
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?

781
01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:41.409
Quite well, actually.

782
01:03:42.411 --> 01:03:46.081
I recorded a new guitarist I met in
a cafe last week. It works superb.

783
01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:50.251
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?

784
01:03:56.801 --> 01:03:58.134
Because Marcel, my sweet...

785
01:03:58.969 --> 01:04:00.095
...we're going to make a film.

786
01:04:02.264 --> 01:04:03.848
Just for the Nazis.

787
01:04:13.613 --> 01:04:15.782
Right this way,
Lieutenant.

788
01:04:35.969 --> 01:04:38.638
Lieutenant Archie Hicox
reporting, sir.

789
01:04:38.722 --> 01:04:41.516
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.

790
01:04:42.351 --> 01:04:43.560
Drink?

791
01:04:45.312 --> 01:04:49.524
If you offer me a scotch and plain water,
I could drink a scotch and plain water.

792
01:04:49.608 --> 01:04:53.195
That-a-boy, Lieutenant. Make it
yourself like a good chap, will you?

793
01:04:53.278 --> 01:04:55.280
The bar is in the globe.

794
01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.745
Something for yourself,
sir?

795
01:05:01.828 --> 01:05:04.998
Whiskey. Straight.
No junk in it.

796
01:05:06.249 --> 01:05:09.169
It says here that
you speak German fluently.

797
01:05:09.252 --> 01:05:11.213
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

798
01:05:11.296 --> 01:05:13.924
And your occupation
before the war?

799
01:05:14.007 --> 01:05:15.175
I'm a film critic.

800
01:05:15.801 --> 01:05:17.761
List your accomplishments.

801
01:05:17.844 --> 01:05:19.721
Well, sir,
such as they are,

802
01:05:19.805 --> 01:05:24.351
I write reviews and articles for a
publication called Films and Filmmakers,

803
01:05:24.434 --> 01:05:26.853
and I've had
two books published.

804
01:05:27.187 --> 01:05:30.774
Impressive. Don't be modest,
Lieutenant. What are their titles?

805
01:05:30.857 --> 01:05:31.858
The first book
was called

806
01:05:31.942 --> 01:05:36.446
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.

807
01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:40.367
And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.

808
01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:45.789
It's a subtextual film criticism study
of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.

809
01:05:46.289 --> 01:05:47.874
What should we
drink to, sir?

810
01:05:47.958 --> 01:05:49.209
Well...

811
01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.421
Down with Hitler.

812
01:05:52.504 --> 01:05:53.880
All the way down, sir.

813
01:05:54.256 --> 01:05:55.507
Yes.

814
01:05:59.219 --> 01:06:03.306
Are you familiar with German
cinema under the Third Reich?

815
01:06:05.183 --> 01:06:09.396
Yes. Obviously, I haven't seen any of
the films made in the last three years,

816
01:06:09.479 --> 01:06:11.732
but I'm familiar with it.

817
01:06:11.815 --> 01:06:12.858
Explain it to me.

818
01:06:13.525 --> 01:06:14.568
Pardon, sir?

819
01:06:14.651 --> 01:06:18.905
Well, this little escapade of ours requires
a knowledge of the German film industry

820
01:06:18.989 --> 01:06:24.161
under the Third Reich. Explain
to me U FA under Goebbels.

821
01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:28.707
Goebbels considers
the films he's making

822
01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:32.044
to be the beginning of a
new era in German cinema.

823
01:06:32.502 --> 01:06:34.171
An alternative
to what he considers

824
01:06:34.254 --> 01:06:37.215
the Jewish-German intellectual
cinema of the '20s,

825
01:06:37.924 --> 01:06:40.594
and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.

826
01:06:40.677 --> 01:06:42.262
How's he doing?

827
01:06:42.804 --> 01:06:45.390
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?

828
01:06:45.849 --> 01:06:50.437
You say he wants to take on
the Jews at their own game.

829
01:06:51.438 --> 01:06:54.441
Well, compared to,
say, Louis B. Mayer,

830
01:06:55.275 --> 01:06:57.527
how's he doing?

831
01:06:57.611 --> 01:06:58.862
Quite well, actually.

832
01:06:59.529 --> 01:07:01.114
Since Goebbels
has taken over,

833
01:07:01.198 --> 01:07:05.619
film attendance has steadily risen
in Germany over the last eight years.

834
01:07:05.702 --> 01:07:09.164
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be
Goebbels' proper opposite number.

835
01:07:09.247 --> 01:07:13.043
I believe Goebbels sees himself
closer to David O. Selznick.

836
01:07:17.464 --> 01:07:18.840
Brief him.

837
01:07:19.174 --> 01:07:24.221
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time
I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.

838
01:07:24.805 --> 01:07:25.931
Three days from now

839
01:07:26.014 --> 01:07:30.352
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.

840
01:07:30.477 --> 01:07:31.561
What film, sir?

841
01:07:31.645 --> 01:07:34.314
The motion picture is
called Nation's Pride.

842
01:07:35.273 --> 01:07:38.652
In attendance at this
joyous Germatic occasion

843
01:07:38.735 --> 01:07:43.156
will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann,
and most of the German High Command

844
01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.994
including all high ranking officers
of both the SS and the Gestapo,

845
01:07:47.077 --> 01:07:50.497
as well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry.

846
01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:52.666
The master race at play?

847
01:07:52.749 --> 01:07:56.920
Basically, we have all our
rotten eggs in one basket.

848
01:07:57.004 --> 01:07:59.548
The objective
of Operation Kino,

849
01:08:00.465 --> 01:08:02.217
blow up the basket.

850
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:07.097
And like the snows of
yesteryear, gone from this earth.

851
01:08:08.015 --> 01:08:09.683
Jolly good, sir.

852
01:08:10.434 --> 01:08:13.937
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines

853
01:08:14.021 --> 01:08:15.564
will be your assist.

854
01:08:15.647 --> 01:08:19.526
The Germans call them
the Basterds.

855
01:08:20.068 --> 01:08:23.280
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.

856
01:08:23.447 --> 01:08:26.283
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.

857
01:08:26.366 --> 01:08:30.370
But the Jerries have heard of them, because
these Yanks have been them the devil.

858
01:08:30.454 --> 01:08:35.167
You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.

859
01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:37.336
The Basterds
will be waiting for you.

860
01:08:37.419 --> 01:08:40.172
First thing, you'll go to a
little village called Nadine.

861
01:08:41.298 --> 01:08:44.092
In Nadine, there's a
tavern called La Louisiane.

862
01:08:44.176 --> 01:08:47.346
There you'll rendezvous with our
double agent. She'll take it from there.

863
01:08:47.429 --> 01:08:49.556
She's the one who is going
to get you into the premiere.

864
01:08:49.639 --> 01:08:53.393
It'll be you, her, and two
German-born members of the Basterds.

865
01:08:53.477 --> 01:08:56.897
She's also made all the other
arrangements you're going to need.

866
01:08:57.731 --> 01:08:58.899
How will I know her?

867
01:08:59.024 --> 01:09:02.235
I suspect that won't be
too much trouble for you.

868
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:06.239
Your contact
is Bridget von Hammersmark.

869
01:09:06.323 --> 01:09:07.783
Bridget von Hammersmark?

870
01:09:09.034 --> 01:09:12.037
The German movie star
is working for England?

871
01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.706
Yes, for the last
two years now.

872
01:09:14.790 --> 01:09:18.335
One could even say that
Operation Kino was her brainchild.

873
01:09:18.418 --> 01:09:19.586
Indeed.

874
01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:20.712
Got the gist?

875
01:09:20.796 --> 01:09:23.548
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.

876
01:09:27.678 --> 01:09:31.181
You didn't say the goddamn
rendezvous is in a fucking basement.

877
01:09:31.264 --> 01:09:32.599
I didn't know.

878
01:09:32.683 --> 01:09:34.101
You said it was
in a tavern.

879
01:09:34.184 --> 01:09:35.352
It is a tavern.

880
01:09:35.435 --> 01:09:36.812
Yeah, in a basement.

881
01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:40.357
You know, fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.

882
01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.735
Number one being, you're
fighting in a basement.

883
01:09:43.819 --> 01:09:45.696
What if we go in there
and she's not even there?

884
01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:47.030
We wait.

885
01:09:47.864 --> 01:09:51.952
Don't worry. She's a British
spy. She'll make the rendezvous.

886
01:10:13.473 --> 01:10:15.809
Stiglitz, right?

887
01:10:15.892 --> 01:10:16.935
That's right, sir.

888
01:10:18.186 --> 01:10:20.689
I hear you're pretty good
with that.

889
01:10:24.484 --> 01:10:27.612
You know, we're not looking
for trouble right now.

890
01:10:27.863 --> 01:10:31.408
Simply making contact with our
agent. Should be uneventful.

891
01:10:33.243 --> 01:10:38.123
However, the off chance I'm
wrong, things prove eventful,

892
01:10:39.333 --> 01:10:42.252
I need to know
we can all remain calm.

893
01:10:46.965 --> 01:10:48.383
I don't look calm to you?

894
01:10:51.345 --> 01:10:56.224
Well, now that you put it
like that, I guess you do.

895
01:11:11.365 --> 01:11:17.162
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not
exactly the loquacious type, is he?

896
01:11:18.997 --> 01:11:22.709
Is that the kind of man
you need? Loquacious type?

897
01:11:24.461 --> 01:11:27.005
Fair point, Lieutenant.

898
01:11:29.299 --> 01:11:32.052
So you all get in trouble in
there, what are we supposed to do?

899
01:11:32.135 --> 01:11:34.346
Make bets
on how it all comes out?

900
01:11:35.555 --> 01:11:38.725
If we get into trouble,
we can handle it.

901
01:11:40.227 --> 01:11:43.146
But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure

902
01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:47.401
no Germans, or French, for that
matter, escape from that basement.

903
01:11:48.318 --> 01:11:52.572
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.

904
01:11:52.906 --> 01:11:58.578
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose
idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?

905
01:11:59.579 --> 01:12:00.998
She chose the spot.

906
01:12:01.081 --> 01:12:02.708
Isn't that just dandy?

907
01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:06.753
Look, she's not a military
strategist. She's just an actress.

908
01:12:07.129 --> 01:12:10.966
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to
know you don't want to fight in a basement.

909
01:12:11.049 --> 01:12:13.093
She wasn't picking
a place to fight.

910
01:12:13.176 --> 01:12:15.971
She was picking a place
isolated and without Germans.

911
01:12:17.436 --> 01:12:18.603
So, I'm male...

912
01:12:19.438 --> 01:12:21.606
...I'm a fictional, literary character
from the past...

913
01:12:21.815 --> 01:12:24.609
...I'm American, and that's controversial.

914
01:12:25.527 --> 01:12:27.945
No, it's not controversial at all.

915
01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:32.950
The nationality of the author has nothing to do
with the nationality of the character.

916
01:12:33.994 --> 01:12:35.620
The character is the character.

917
01:12:36.372 --> 01:12:38.289
Hamlet is not British. He is Danish.

918
01:12:39.291 --> 01:12:42.085
So yes, this character was born in America.

919
01:12:42.169 --> 01:12:43.211
Well then.

920
01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:46.130
Mathilda.

921
01:12:46.215 --> 01:12:48.299
Schnapps?

922
01:12:48.384 --> 01:12:49.675
Schnapps...Schnapps...Schnapps.

923
01:12:49.968 --> 01:12:51.344
Five schnapps, please.

924
01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.723
If I had a wife...

925
01:12:57.017 --> 01:12:58.184
...would she be called a squaw?

926
01:12:58.477 --> 01:12:59.519
Yes!

927
01:12:59.603 --> 01:13:00.645
He's got it.

928
01:13:00.729 --> 01:13:01.854
Three more questions!

929
01:13:02.189 --> 01:13:03.648
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?

930
01:13:03.732 --> 01:13:04.774
Yes!

931
01:13:04.858 --> 01:13:05.900
Did Karl May write me?

932
01:13:05.984 --> 01:13:07.068
Yes!

933
01:13:07.152 --> 01:13:08.236
So who are you?!

934
01:13:08.529 --> 01:13:11.072
I am "Winnetou," chief of the Apaches!

935
01:13:11.532 --> 01:13:12.615
Yes!

936
01:13:13.283 --> 01:13:14.742
That was good! That was good! That was good!

937
01:13:14.952 --> 01:13:16.369
Now down with the glasses!

938
01:13:16.745 --> 01:13:19.539
Cheers.

939
01:13:26.754 --> 01:13:27.838
Attention!

940
01:13:35.013 --> 01:13:36.305
Hello, my lovelies.

941
01:13:36.931 --> 01:13:38.015
Take a seat.

942
01:13:38.975 --> 01:13:42.603
I will join you in moments. I'm just saying
goodbye to my five new friends here.

943
01:13:43.605 --> 01:13:45.856
No hurry, Frau von Hammersmark. Take your time.

944
01:13:46.274 --> 01:13:47.900
Enjoy yourself. We'll be just over here waiting.

945
01:13:55.450 --> 01:13:58.619
Eric, my love.
Those are the friends I've been waiting for.

946
01:13:58.786 --> 01:14:00.496
Please treat them to anything they like.

947
01:14:01.039 --> 01:14:03.457
Frau von Hammersmark. Your wish is my command.

948
01:14:05.043 --> 01:14:06.126
Officers...

949
01:14:06.419 --> 01:14:08.045
...it would appear
the drinks are on the Fräulein.

950
01:14:08.713 --> 01:14:09.713
What would you like?

951
01:14:09.797 --> 01:14:10.797
Whiskey.

952
01:14:10.965 --> 01:14:12.007
Two whiskeys.

953
01:14:12.091 --> 01:14:13.091
Three whiskeys.

954
01:14:13.176 --> 01:14:14.259
Three whiskeys, very well.

955
01:14:16.429 --> 01:14:18.472
I wish you a wonderful evening.

956
01:14:18.556 --> 01:14:20.474
Same to you.
- I thank you.

957
01:14:20.683 --> 01:14:22.392
Your card!

958
01:14:22.727 --> 01:14:23.810
Yes, you're right.

959
01:14:25.021 --> 01:14:26.146
Let's see.

960
01:14:27.482 --> 01:14:30.150
Genghis Khan!
I would never have gotten that.

961
01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.527
But of course you would have!

962
01:14:31.778 --> 01:14:32.819
Hello, darling.

963
01:14:35.198 --> 01:14:36.240
How are you?

964
01:14:39.035 --> 01:14:40.452
So good to see you.

965
01:14:49.921 --> 01:14:53.006
I thought this place was supposed to
have more French than Germans?

966
01:14:54.217 --> 01:14:56.218
Yes, normally that's true.

967
01:14:56.386 --> 01:14:59.680
The Sergeant over there's wife just had a baby.

968
01:15:00.348 --> 01:15:05.519
And his commanding officer gave him
and his mates the night off to celebrate.

969
01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.522
We should leave.

970
01:15:09.190 --> 01:15:10.232
No.

971
01:15:10.858 --> 01:15:11.900
We should stay.

972
01:15:12.193 --> 01:15:13.527
For one drink at least.

973
01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.779
I've been waiting for you in a bar.

974
01:15:15.989 --> 01:15:19.074
It would look strange if
we left before we had a drink.

975
01:15:19.409 --> 01:15:22.369
She's right. Just be calm
and enjoy your whiskey.

976
01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:24.419
Mmm.

977
01:15:28.626 --> 01:15:29.668
Mathilda...

978
01:15:29.752 --> 01:15:31.712
...come join us in the game.
Take Frau Hammersmark's place.

979
01:15:41.055 --> 01:15:42.764
She would love to play the game.

980
01:15:44.976 --> 01:15:47.394
I will translate... and protect.

981
01:15:47.687 --> 01:15:48.729
Don't worry, pretty little thing.

982
01:15:48.896 --> 01:15:53.233
If any of these wolves gets
out of line, I'll kick their ass in.

983
01:15:53.443 --> 01:15:54.484
Watch.

984
01:15:56.904 --> 01:15:57.946
Rip off his nose.

985
01:16:05.622 --> 01:16:06.663
Stop it!

986
01:16:06.748 --> 01:16:09.082
Schnapps, schnapps, take your
schnapps in hand, comrades.

987
01:16:09.917 --> 01:16:11.001
Before we go on playing...

988
01:16:11.586 --> 01:16:12.628
...we will drink.

989
01:16:13.671 --> 01:16:15.797
We drink to our friend Wilhelm.

990
01:16:17.592 --> 01:16:18.759
And his little boy...

991
01:16:19.719 --> 01:16:20.761
...Maximilian.

992
01:16:21.721 --> 01:16:23.096
To Max!
- To Max!

993
01:16:24.098 --> 01:16:25.390
There's some new development.

994
01:16:26.059 --> 01:16:27.601
The cinema venue has changed.

995
01:16:28.019 --> 01:16:29.102
Why?

996
01:16:29.187 --> 01:16:31.146
No one knows but that should
not be a real problem.

997
01:16:31.814 --> 01:16:34.733
The cinema it's been changed to
is considerably smaller than The Ritz.

998
01:16:35.485 --> 01:16:39.071
So whatever explosives you brought for
The Ritz should be doubly effective here.

999
01:16:42.784 --> 01:16:44.117
Now the next piece of information...

1000
01:16:44.619 --> 01:16:45.661
...is colossal.

1001
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:47.245
Try not to overreact.

1002
01:16:49.624 --> 01:16:50.666
The Führer-

1003
01:16:53.419 --> 01:16:54.628
...I was just thinking...

1004
01:16:55.463 --> 01:16:58.298
...could you sign an autograph
to my son on his birthday?

1005
01:17:00.218 --> 01:17:02.469
Of course. I'd love to, Wilhelm.

1006
01:17:03.471 --> 01:17:06.973
This handsome Staff Sergeant
just became a father today.

1007
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:08.392
Congratulations.

1008
01:17:09.977 --> 01:17:11.019
Thank you.

1009
01:17:11.104 --> 01:17:12.771
Do you know the name of this progeny yet?

1010
01:17:13.648 --> 01:17:18.610
I most certainly do,
Fräulein. His name is Maximilian.

1011
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:20.612
Maximilian, wonderful name.

1012
01:17:22.824 --> 01:17:24.366
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1013
01:17:26.786 --> 01:17:29.621
Nothing but the best
for little Maximilian.

1014
01:17:36.337 --> 01:17:39.756
Max may not know who you are now but...

1015
01:17:41.008 --> 01:17:43.176
...he will. I will show him
all of your movies.

1016
01:17:43.636 --> 01:17:44.678
Good.

1017
01:17:44.762 --> 01:17:46.805
He will grow up with your films and...

1018
01:17:49.475 --> 01:17:51.351
...this napkin on his wall.

1019
01:17:51.853 --> 01:17:57.357
I propose a toast to
the greatest actress in Germany!

1020
01:17:57.567 --> 01:18:01.987
There is no Dietrich! There is no Riefenstahl!
Only Von Hammersmark!

1021
01:18:03.489 --> 01:18:04.656
Cheers!
- Cheers!

1022
01:18:05.324 --> 01:18:06.366
Cheers!

1023
01:18:11.664 --> 01:18:12.831
Once again-

1024
01:18:15.668 --> 01:18:19.379
Frau Hammersmark, what brings you to France?

1025
01:18:20.923 --> 01:18:22.674
None of your business!

1026
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.843
Staff Sergeant.

1027
01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:33.393
You might not have worn out your welcome with
the Fräulein with your drunken boorish behavior...

1028
01:18:34.187 --> 01:18:35.520
...but you have worn out your welcome with me.

1029
01:18:37.523 --> 01:18:41.276
Might I remind you, Staff Sergeant,
you are an enlisted man.

1030
01:18:41.527 --> 01:18:43.195
This is an officer's table!

1031
01:18:45.698 --> 01:18:49.117
I suggest you stop pestering the Fräulein...

1032
01:18:49.869 --> 01:18:51.703
...and rejoin your table.

1033
01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:02.380
Excuse me, Captain,
but your accent is very unusual.

1034
01:19:05.551 --> 01:19:06.551
Where are you from?

1035
01:19:09.597 --> 01:19:12.808
You must be either completely
drunk or mad to dare...

1036
01:19:13.226 --> 01:19:15.393
...to speak to a superior officer with
such impertinentness!

1037
01:19:15.895 --> 01:19:17.062
Staff Sergeant.

1038
01:19:18.564 --> 01:19:20.232
I'm making you and you responsible for him.

1039
01:19:20.316 --> 01:19:21.608
I suggest you take hold of your friend...

1040
01:19:21.734 --> 01:19:25.821
...or he'll spend Max's first birthday
in jail for public drunkenness.

1041
01:19:25.947 --> 01:19:25.987
Might I inquire?

1042
01:19:25.988 --> 01:19:27.781
Might I inquire?

1043
01:19:59.564 --> 01:20:01.398
Like our young newly christened father here...

1044
01:20:02.567 --> 01:20:04.985
...l, too, have an acute ear for accents.

1045
01:20:08.614 --> 01:20:09.656
And like him...

1046
01:20:10.783 --> 01:20:12.200
...l, too, find yours odd.

1047
01:20:14.579 --> 01:20:15.745
From where do you hail, Captain?

1048
01:20:16.289 --> 01:20:17.372
Major, this is highly-

1049
01:20:17.456 --> 01:20:19.666
I wasn't speaking to you, Lieutenant Munich.

1050
01:20:21.043 --> 01:20:23.628
Or you either, Lieutenant Frankfurt.

1051
01:20:25.548 --> 01:20:30.260
I was speaking to Captain l-don't-know-what.

1052
01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:39.144
I was born in a village that rests
in the shadow of the Piz Palü.

1053
01:20:39.478 --> 01:20:40.562
The mountain?

1054
01:20:40.646 --> 01:20:41.646
Yes.

1055
01:20:42.315 --> 01:20:43.815
In that village, we all speak like this.

1056
01:20:45.484 --> 01:20:47.694
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

1057
01:20:48.112 --> 01:20:49.112
Yes.

1058
01:20:49.196 --> 01:20:50.530
Then you saw me.

1059
01:20:52.283 --> 01:20:55.327
You remember the skiing torch scene?

1060
01:20:57.163 --> 01:20:58.204
Yes.

1061
01:20:59.206 --> 01:21:04.836
In that scene was myself, my father,
my sister and my two brothers.

1062
01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:08.173
My brother is so handsome...

1063
01:21:08.633 --> 01:21:12.177
...the director Pabst, gave him a Close-Up.

1064
01:21:13.054 --> 01:21:16.473
Herr Major, if my word means anything...

1065
01:21:17.183 --> 01:21:21.019
...I can vouch for everything
the young captain has just said.

1066
01:21:22.521 --> 01:21:25.023
He does hail from the bottom of the Piz Palü.

1067
01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:30.236
He was in the film and his brother is far more
handsome than he.

1068
01:21:40.706 --> 01:21:42.248
You should rejoin your friends.

1069
01:21:46.462 --> 01:21:47.504
May I join you?

1070
01:21:47.588 --> 01:21:48.672
By all means.

1071
01:21:49.799 --> 01:21:50.840
Wunderbar!

1072
01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:01.726
So that's the source of your bizarre accent.

1073
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:04.270
That's extraordinary.

1074
01:22:04.981 --> 01:22:06.022
What are you doing here?

1075
01:22:06.399 --> 01:22:09.401
Aside from having a drink
with the lovely Fräulein?

1076
01:22:10.403 --> 01:22:13.029
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.

1077
01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.448
I mean in country.

1078
01:22:17.076 --> 01:22:19.869
You're obviously not stationed in
France or I'd know who you are.

1079
01:22:20.621 --> 01:22:22.414
You know every German in France?

1080
01:22:23.249 --> 01:22:24.332
Worth knowing.

1081
01:22:30.589 --> 01:22:32.340
Well, there lies the problem.

1082
01:22:33.134 --> 01:22:34.634
We never claimed to be worth knowing.

1083
01:22:35.886 --> 01:22:37.554
All levity aside,
what are you doing in France?

1084
01:22:39.265 --> 01:22:42.225
Attending Minister Goebbels' film
premiere as the Fräulein's escort.

1085
01:22:44.812 --> 01:22:47.022
You are the Fräulein Hammersmark's escort.

1086
01:22:48.190 --> 01:22:51.026
Someone has to carry her lighter.

1087
01:22:56.949 --> 01:23:00.326
The captain is my date,
but all three are my guests.

1088
01:23:01.203 --> 01:23:02.579
We are old friends...

1089
01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:04.664
...who go back a long time.

1090
01:23:06.167 --> 01:23:10.420
Actually, longer than an actress
would care to admit.

1091
01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:14.924
Well, in that case...

1092
01:23:15.134 --> 01:23:18.428
...let me raise my glass to the
three luckiest men in the room.

1093
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:20.513
I'll drink to that.

1094
01:23:24.101 --> 01:23:25.727
Queen Christina.

1095
01:23:30.024 --> 01:23:31.900
Mata Hari.

1096
01:23:36.697 --> 01:23:37.781
I must say...

1097
01:23:38.199 --> 01:23:40.450
...that game they're playing
looks like a good bit of fun.

1098
01:23:40.993 --> 01:23:43.495
I didn't join them because
you're quite right, Captain.

1099
01:23:44.163 --> 01:23:46.331
An officer should not
fraternize with enlisted men.

1100
01:23:47.958 --> 01:23:49.000
But...

1101
01:23:49.710 --> 01:23:51.211
...seeing as we are all officers...

1102
01:23:52.838 --> 01:23:54.464
...and sophisticated lady
friends of officers.

1103
01:23:55.007 --> 01:23:56.049
What say we play the game?

1104
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:58.676
Yes, great, one game.

1105
01:23:58.928 --> 01:23:59.969
Wunderbar.

1106
01:24:02.431 --> 01:24:03.515
Soldiers...

1107
01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.183
...the cards.

1108
01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:08.561
Thank you.

1109
01:24:10.564 --> 01:24:11.606
So gentlemen...

1110
01:24:13.067 --> 01:24:14.859
...the object of the game is to...

1111
01:24:15.236 --> 01:24:17.737
...write the name of a famous
person on your card.

1112
01:24:18.197 --> 01:24:19.989
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.

1113
01:24:20.699 --> 01:24:22.909
For instance, you could write,
Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.

1114
01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.369
Eric! More pens.

1115
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:26.538
And they must be famous, not aunt Frida.

1116
01:24:27.206 --> 01:24:29.541
When you finish writing,
put the card face down on the table.

1117
01:24:30.084 --> 01:24:32.001
And move it to the person on your right-

1118
01:24:32.253 --> 01:24:33.294
Thanks.

1119
01:24:33.379 --> 01:24:35.421
the person to your left
moves his card to you.

1120
01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.841
You pick up the card without looking at it...

1121
01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:39.300
...lick the back...

1122
01:24:41.595 --> 01:24:43.138
...and stick it on your forehead.

1123
01:24:57.444 --> 01:24:58.528
Write!

1124
01:24:58.612 --> 01:24:59.654
Write.

1125
01:25:20.801 --> 01:25:22.635
I'll start, give you the idea.

1126
01:25:25.639 --> 01:25:26.681
Am I German?

1127
01:25:26.974 --> 01:25:28.057
No.
- No.

1128
01:25:28.475 --> 01:25:29.517
Am I American?

1129
01:25:29.685 --> 01:25:30.727
No.
- No.

1130
01:25:30.811 --> 01:25:32.061
Wait a minute, he goes to... -

1131
01:25:32.855 --> 01:25:35.857
Obviously, he wasn't born in America.

1132
01:25:36.150 --> 01:25:38.985
So... I visited America, aye?

1133
01:25:39.195 --> 01:25:40.278
Yes.

1134
01:25:42.531 --> 01:25:43.656
Was this visit fortuitous?

1135
01:25:44.491 --> 01:25:45.533
Not for you.

1136
01:25:47.995 --> 01:25:51.664
My native land, is it what one would call, exotic?

1137
01:25:51.749 --> 01:25:52.790
Yes.
- Yes.

1138
01:25:56.003 --> 01:26:00.882
That could be either a reference
to the jungle or the Orient.

1139
01:26:02.676 --> 01:26:05.345
I'm going to let my first instinct
take over and ask. Am I from the jungle?

1140
01:26:05.512 --> 01:26:06.554
Yes.
- Yes.

1141
01:26:06.847 --> 01:26:10.099
Now gentlemen, around this time you could
ask whether you're real or fictitious.

1142
01:26:10.684 --> 01:26:13.186
I, however, think that's too easy,
so I won't ask that yet.

1143
01:26:13.812 --> 01:26:14.896
Okay...

1144
01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.232
...my native land is the jungle...

1145
01:26:18.359 --> 01:26:19.525
...I visited America...

1146
01:26:20.694 --> 01:26:22.237
...but my visit was not fortuitous to me...

1147
01:26:23.155 --> 01:26:26.699
...but the implication is
that it was to somebody else.

1148
01:26:31.872 --> 01:26:32.914
When I went...

1149
01:26:34.708 --> 01:26:36.542
...from the jungle to America...

1150
01:26:39.672 --> 01:26:40.713
...did I go by boat?

1151
01:26:40.798 --> 01:26:41.839
Yes.
- Yes.

1152
01:26:43.717 --> 01:26:45.176
Did I go against my will?

1153
01:26:45.261 --> 01:26:46.302
Yes.
- Yes.

1154
01:26:50.516 --> 01:26:52.141
On this boat ride, was I in chains?

1155
01:26:52.434 --> 01:26:53.476
Yes.

1156
01:26:53.894 --> 01:26:56.145
When I arrived in America,
was I displayed in chains?

1157
01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:57.272
Yes.
- Yes.

1158
01:26:57.356 --> 01:26:58.898
Am I the story of the Negro in America?

1159
01:26:58.983 --> 01:27:00.024
No.

1160
01:27:00.734 --> 01:27:01.985
Well then I must be King Kong.

1161
01:27:04.655 --> 01:27:05.697
Bravo!

1162
01:27:05.906 --> 01:27:07.282
lmpressive.

1163
01:27:08.492 --> 01:27:11.536
Now, since I answered correctly, you
all need to finish your drinks.

1164
01:27:12.371 --> 01:27:13.413
Cheers.

1165
01:27:18.836 --> 01:27:19.877
Now, who is next?

1166
01:27:20.838 --> 01:27:21.879
Well, Major...

1167
01:27:23.507 --> 01:27:29.095
...I don't mean to be rude. But
the four of us are very good friends.

1168
01:27:30.222 --> 01:27:31.931
And we haven't seen
each other in quite a while.

1169
01:27:34.518 --> 01:27:35.601
So, Major...

1170
01:27:36.186 --> 01:27:37.353
...I am afraid...

1171
01:27:38.605 --> 01:27:39.689
...you are intruding.

1172
01:27:41.775 --> 01:27:43.776
I beg to differ, Captain.

1173
01:27:45.529 --> 01:27:50.533
It's only if the Fräulein considers
my presence an intrusion...

1174
01:27:51.702 --> 01:27:53.036
...that I become an intruder.

1175
01:27:58.417 --> 01:28:00.209
How about it, Fräulein von Hammersmark?
Am I intruding?

1176
01:28:01.587 --> 01:28:02.628
I didn't think so.

1177
01:28:04.465 --> 01:28:07.967
It's simply the captain
is immune to my charms.

1178
01:28:23.067 --> 01:28:24.400
I am just joking.

1179
01:28:25.444 --> 01:28:29.072
Just joking. Of course I'm intruding.

1180
01:28:29.281 --> 01:28:33.409
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen,
and I will bid you and the Fräulein adieu.

1181
01:28:34.244 --> 01:28:36.954
Eric has a bottle of
thirty-three-year-old whiskey.

1182
01:28:37.164 --> 01:28:38.247
From the Scottish Highlands.

1183
01:28:39.291 --> 01:28:40.416
What do you say, gentlemen?

1184
01:28:41.085 --> 01:28:43.169
You're most gracious, Major.

1185
01:28:43.295 --> 01:28:46.089
Eric! The thirty-three. And new glasses!

1186
01:28:46.673 --> 01:28:49.717
You don't want to contaminate the
thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.

1187
01:28:49.802 --> 01:28:50.843
How many glasses?

1188
01:28:50.928 --> 01:28:51.636
Five.

1189
01:28:51.678 --> 01:28:52.512
Not for me.

1190
01:28:52.596 --> 01:28:54.097
I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.

1191
01:28:54.515 --> 01:28:55.932
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.

1192
01:28:56.850 --> 01:28:57.934
Three glasses.

1193
01:29:34.138 --> 01:29:35.179
Frau von Hammersmark.

1194
01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:37.181
Thank you.

1195
01:29:39.893 --> 01:29:42.687
A thousand year German Reich!

1196
01:29:43.063 --> 01:29:44.564
A thousand year Reich!
- A thousand year Reich!

1197
01:29:54.575 --> 01:29:56.534
I must say I grow weary of these monkeyshines.

1198
01:29:59.955 --> 01:30:01.038
Did you hear that?

1199
01:30:03.125 --> 01:30:04.917
That was the sound of my Walther.

1200
01:30:05.627 --> 01:30:07.378
Pointed right at your testicles.

1201
01:30:10.924 --> 01:30:13.384
Why do you have your
Walther pointed at my testicles?

1202
01:30:14.887 --> 01:30:17.722
Because you've just given
yourself away, Captain.

1203
01:30:18.891 --> 01:30:20.975
You're no more German than that scotch.

1204
01:30:30.444 --> 01:30:31.444
Well, Major.

1205
01:30:31.528 --> 01:30:32.570
Shut up slut.

1206
01:30:33.572 --> 01:30:34.614
You were saying?

1207
01:30:39.203 --> 01:30:42.705
I was saying that makes two of us.

1208
01:30:43.957 --> 01:30:47.084
I've had a gun pointed at your
balls since you sat down.

1209
01:30:49.463 --> 01:30:50.755
That makes three of us.

1210
01:30:51.089 --> 01:30:54.926
And at this range,
I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.

1211
01:30:56.762 --> 01:30:59.138
Looks like we have a bit
of a sticky situation here.

1212
01:31:00.098 --> 01:31:03.309
What's going to happen, Major...

1213
01:31:04.436 --> 01:31:07.104
...you're going to stand up
and walk out that door with us.

1214
01:31:07.272 --> 01:31:08.272
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1215
01:31:08.357 --> 01:31:09.649
I don't think so.

1216
01:31:09.942 --> 01:31:11.108
I'm afraid you and I...

1217
01:31:11.485 --> 01:31:13.444
...we both know, Captain...

1218
01:31:13.862 --> 01:31:17.114
...no matter what happens to anybody else
in this room...

1219
01:31:17.533 --> 01:31:20.117
...the two of us aren't going anywhere.

1220
01:31:22.996 --> 01:31:27.625
Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm
and his famous friends.

1221
01:31:29.461 --> 01:31:32.129
If any of you expect to live,
you'll have to shoot them too.

1222
01:31:33.632 --> 01:31:36.759
Looks like little Max will grow up an orphan.

1223
01:31:38.053 --> 01:31:39.428
How sad.

1224
01:31:45.650 --> 01:31:47.986
Well, if this is it,
old boy,

1225
01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:51.573
I hope you don't mind if I
go out speaking the King's.

1226
01:31:52.699 --> 01:31:54.617
By all means,
Captain.

1227
01:32:00.665 --> 01:32:04.294
There's a special rung in hell reserved
for people who waste good Scotch.

1228
01:32:05.712 --> 01:32:08.506
Seeing as I may be rapping
on the door momentarily,

1229
01:32:13.595 --> 01:32:17.223
I must say,
damn good stuff, sir.

1230
01:32:20.518 --> 01:32:23.354
Now, about this pickle

1231
01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:26.733
we find ourselves in.

1232
01:32:29.152 --> 01:32:32.238
It would appear there's only
one thing left for you to do.

1233
01:32:32.322 --> 01:32:34.199
And what would that be?

1234
01:32:34.908 --> 01:32:35.909
Stiglitz.

1235
01:32:35.992 --> 01:32:37.410
Say auf Wiedersehen
to your Nazi balls.

1236
01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:15.907
You outside.
Who are you?

1237
01:33:16.491 --> 01:33:18.159
British? American?

1238
01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:20.036
What?

1239
01:33:20.828 --> 01:33:22.372
We're American.

1240
01:33:22.664 --> 01:33:24.123
What are you?

1241
01:33:24.457 --> 01:33:26.417
I'm a German, you idiot.

1242
01:33:26.751 --> 01:33:29.462
Speak English
pretty good for a German.

1243
01:33:29.546 --> 01:33:30.755
I agree.

1244
01:33:32.048 --> 01:33:33.550
So let's talk.

1245
01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:35.677
Okay, talk.

1246
01:33:36.386 --> 01:33:37.845
I'm a father.

1247
01:33:39.097 --> 01:33:42.016
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.

1248
01:33:42.517 --> 01:33:44.060
Five hours ago.

1249
01:33:44.686 --> 01:33:48.940
H is name is Max. We were in
here drinking, celebrating.

1250
01:33:49.774 --> 01:33:53.194
They're the ones that came in shooting
and killing. It's not my fault!

1251
01:33:53.278 --> 01:33:55.405
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.

1252
01:33:56.781 --> 01:33:58.575
What's your name,
soldier?

1253
01:33:58.658 --> 01:33:59.909
Wilhelm.

1254
01:34:00.785 --> 01:34:04.330
Now, is there anybody alive
on our side?

1255
01:34:04.414 --> 01:34:06.207
No.
I'm alive!

1256
01:34:08.418 --> 01:34:09.794
Who's that?

1257
01:34:12.589 --> 01:34:14.591
Is the girl
on your side?

1258
01:34:16.134 --> 01:34:17.385
Which girl?

1259
01:34:17.468 --> 01:34:19.888
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.

1260
01:34:21.472 --> 01:34:23.099
Yeah, she's ours.

1261
01:34:23.933 --> 01:34:25.184
Is she okay?

1262
01:34:28.187 --> 01:34:29.230
Wilhelm!

1263
01:34:30.481 --> 01:34:32.108
She's been shot.

1264
01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:34.694
But she's alive.

1265
01:34:38.615 --> 01:34:40.116
Okay, Wilhelm.

1266
01:34:41.117 --> 01:34:43.536
What do you say
we make us a deal?

1267
01:34:44.871 --> 01:34:46.247
What's your name?

1268
01:34:46.331 --> 01:34:47.457
Aldo.

1269
01:34:48.333 --> 01:34:50.585
Okay, Wilhelm,
here's my deal.

1270
01:34:50.835 --> 01:34:54.464
You let me and one of my men come
down there and take the girl away.

1271
01:34:54.547 --> 01:34:57.091
No guns. No guns me,
no guns you.

1272
01:34:57.175 --> 01:35:00.720
And we take the girl and
leave. It's that simple, Willi.

1273
01:35:01.095 --> 01:35:03.556
You go your way,
we go ours.

1274
01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.517
And little Max gets to grow up
playing catch with his daddy.

1275
01:35:07.685 --> 01:35:10.605
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?

1276
01:35:15.026 --> 01:35:16.110
Aldo.

1277
01:35:17.362 --> 01:35:18.988
I'm here, Willi.

1278
01:35:20.615 --> 01:35:22.367
I want to trust you.

1279
01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:23.618
But...

1280
01:35:24.536 --> 01:35:26.037
But how can I?

1281
01:35:28.248 --> 01:35:30.250
What choice you got,
son?

1282
01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:38.174
Okay, okay.

1283
01:35:39.759 --> 01:35:40.969
Aldo,

1284
01:35:42.053 --> 01:35:43.680
I'm going to trust you.

1285
01:35:44.556 --> 01:35:45.557
Come down.

1286
01:36:01.531 --> 01:36:04.492
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine
gun? I thought we had us a deal?

1287
01:36:04.576 --> 01:36:06.828
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.

1288
01:36:06.911 --> 01:36:08.454
Not so fast.

1289
01:36:08.538 --> 01:36:11.124
We only got a deal,
we trust each other.

1290
01:36:11.207 --> 01:36:12.917
And a Mexican standoff
ain't trust.

1291
01:36:13.418 --> 01:36:15.920
You need guns on me for it
to be a Mexican standoff.

1292
01:36:16.588 --> 01:36:19.716
You got guns on us. You
decide to shoot, we're dead.

1293
01:36:19.799 --> 01:36:23.094
U p top, they got grenades. They
drop them down here, you're dead.

1294
01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:25.555
That's a Mexican standoff,
and that was not the deal.

1295
01:36:25.638 --> 01:36:27.307
No trust,
no deal.

1296
01:36:43.198 --> 01:36:44.782
All right, Aldo.

1297
01:36:46.451 --> 01:36:47.577
Fine.

1298
01:36:50.955 --> 01:36:54.375
J ust take that fucking traitor,
and get her out of my sight.

1299
01:37:06.471 --> 01:37:09.891
Not so goddamn fast, doc. Tell
him to go play with his dogs.

1300
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:25.990
Before we yank that slug out you,
you need to answer a few questions.

1301
01:37:26.074 --> 01:37:27.867
Few questions
about what?

1302
01:37:28.368 --> 01:37:30.537
About I got three men
dead back there.

1303
01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:33.414
Why don't you try telling us
what the fuck happened?

1304
01:37:33.498 --> 01:37:37.460
The British officer blew his German
act and the Gestapo major saw it.

1305
01:37:38.545 --> 01:37:40.797
Before we get into
who shot John,

1306
01:37:41.631 --> 01:37:45.760
why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous
in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?

1307
01:37:50.682 --> 01:37:53.101
I can see since you didn't
see what happened inside,

1308
01:37:53.184 --> 01:37:55.854
that the Nazis being there
must look odd.

1309
01:37:55.937 --> 01:37:58.439
Yeah, we got a word for
that kind of odd in English.

1310
01:37:58.523 --> 01:38:00.525
It's called suspicious.

1311
01:38:04.821 --> 01:38:06.614
Everybody needs
to calm down.

1312
01:38:06.698 --> 01:38:09.367
You're letting your imagination
get the better of you.

1313
01:38:10.743 --> 01:38:13.705
You met the sergeant
yourself. Willi.

1314
01:38:13.788 --> 01:38:15.623
You remember him,
don't you?

1315
01:38:15.707 --> 01:38:16.708
Yeah, I remember him.

1316
01:38:16.791 --> 01:38:20.545
H is wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...

1317
01:38:20.628 --> 01:38:22.338
He had just become
a father!

1318
01:38:22.422 --> 01:38:26.259
H is commanding officer gave him and
his mates the night off to celebrate.

1319
01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:35.494
The Germans being there was either a
trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.

1320
01:38:35.977 --> 01:38:37.729
It couldn't be both.

1321
01:38:47.947 --> 01:38:49.824
How'd the shooting start?

1322
01:38:49.908 --> 01:38:52.410
The Englishman
gave himself away.

1323
01:38:52.493 --> 01:38:54.120
How'd he do that?

1324
01:38:55.371 --> 01:38:57.582
He ordered three glasses.

1325
01:38:58.791 --> 01:39:00.710
We order three glasses.

1326
01:39:00.919 --> 01:39:02.879
That's the German three.

1327
01:39:03.755 --> 01:39:05.548
The other looks odd.

1328
01:39:06.132 --> 01:39:08.468
Germans would
and did notice it.

1329
01:39:17.101 --> 01:39:19.187
Okay, let's pretend
there were no Germans

1330
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:21.856
and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to.

1331
01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:23.858
What was the next step?

1332
01:39:24.108 --> 01:39:25.318
Tuxedos.

1333
01:39:25.985 --> 01:39:28.738
To get them into the premiere
wearing military uniforms

1334
01:39:28.821 --> 01:39:31.616
with all the military there
would've been suicide.

1335
01:39:33.618 --> 01:39:36.871
But going as members
of the German film industry,

1336
01:39:37.288 --> 01:39:40.458
they wear tuxedos and fit
in with everybody else.

1337
01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:45.129
I arranged for the tailor
to fit three tuxedos tonight.

1338
01:39:46.339 --> 01:39:48.758
How'd you intend to get them
in that premiere?

1339
01:39:48.841 --> 01:39:50.468
Hand me my purse.

1340
01:40:00.353 --> 01:40:02.772
Lieutenant Hicox
was going as my escort.

1341
01:40:04.107 --> 01:40:08.111
The other two were going as a
German cameraman and his assistant.

1342
01:40:09.237 --> 01:40:10.905
You still get us
in that premiere?

1343
01:40:10.989 --> 01:40:14.158
You speak German better
than your friends? No.

1344
01:40:14.576 --> 01:40:16.786
Have I been shot? Yes!

1345
01:40:17.328 --> 01:40:22.166
I don't see me tripping the light
fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.

1346
01:40:23.167 --> 01:40:25.587
Least of all,
by tomorrow night.

1347
01:40:38.474 --> 01:40:41.769
However, there's something
you don't know.

1348
01:40:43.855 --> 01:40:47.942
There've been two recent
developments regarding Operation Kino.

1349
01:40:49.736 --> 01:40:54.824
One, the venue has been changed from
The Ritz to a much smaller venue.

1350
01:40:55.366 --> 01:40:58.536
Enormous change at the last
minute? That's not very Germatic.

1351
01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:01.581
Why the hell is Goebbels
doing stuff so damn peculiar?

1352
01:41:01.664 --> 01:41:05.376
It probably has something to
do with the second development.

1353
01:41:05.752 --> 01:41:07.045
Which is?

1354
01:41:11.341 --> 01:41:13.927
Der Führer is attending
the premiere.

1355
01:41:14.796 --> 01:41:16.046
I've been rethinking my position...

1356
01:41:17.757 --> 01:41:24.388
...in regards to your
Paris premiere of "Nation's Pride."

1357
01:41:25.932 --> 01:41:27.766
As the weeks have gone on...

1358
01:41:29.102 --> 01:41:31.270
...and the Americans are on the beach...

1359
01:41:32.772 --> 01:41:35.274
...I do find myself thinking more and more...

1360
01:41:36.067 --> 01:41:37.401
...about this Private Zoller.

1361
01:41:38.736 --> 01:41:40.863
This boy has done something tremendous for us.

1362
01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:43.907
And I'm beginning to think...

1363
01:41:44.117 --> 01:41:48.120
...my participation in this
event could be meaningful.

1364
01:41:48.670 --> 01:41:50.296
Fuck a duck!

1365
01:41:58.930 --> 01:42:00.807
What are you thinking?

1366
01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:04.269
I'm thinking getting a whack
at planting old U ncle Adolf

1367
01:42:04.352 --> 01:42:06.229
makes this horse
a different color.

1368
01:42:06.312 --> 01:42:07.981
What is that
supposed to mean?

1369
01:42:08.064 --> 01:42:09.983
It means you getting us
in that premiere.

1370
01:42:10.066 --> 01:42:12.986
I'm probably going
to end up losing this leg.

1371
01:42:13.611 --> 01:42:15.989
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.

1372
01:42:16.072 --> 01:42:18.950
How do you expect me
to walk the red carpet?

1373
01:42:21.119 --> 01:42:24.122
Doggy doc's going to dig
that slug out your gam.

1374
01:42:24.205 --> 01:42:26.249
He's going to wrap it up
in a cast,

1375
01:42:26.332 --> 01:42:28.459
and you got a good how-I-broke-my-leg-
mountain-climbing story.

1376
01:42:28.543 --> 01:42:31.212
That's German, ain't it? You all
like climbing mountains, don't you?

1377
01:42:31.296 --> 01:42:34.591
I don't. I like smoking, drinking
and ordering in restaurants.

1378
01:42:34.674 --> 01:42:36.467
But I see your point.

1379
01:42:36.718 --> 01:42:40.221
We fill you up with morphine
till it's coming out your ears

1380
01:42:40.305 --> 01:42:43.600
and just limp your little
ass up that reuge carpet.

1381
01:42:45.101 --> 01:42:48.354
I know this is a silly
question before I ask it,

1382
01:42:48.438 --> 01:42:53.818
but can you Americans speak
any other language than English?

1383
01:42:54.652 --> 01:42:56.905
We both speak
a little Italian.

1384
01:42:56.988 --> 01:42:59.490
With an atrocious accent,
no doubt.

1385
01:43:01.242 --> 01:43:04.704
But that doesn't exactly
kill us in the crib.

1386
01:43:05.496 --> 01:43:08.333
Germans don't have
a good ear for Italian.

1387
01:43:12.253 --> 01:43:16.090
So you mumble Italian and brazen
through it. Is that the plan?

1388
01:43:16.341 --> 01:43:17.967
That's about it.

1389
01:43:21.804 --> 01:43:22.805
That sounds good.

1390
01:43:22.889 --> 01:43:25.266
It sounds like shit. What else
are we going to do? Go home?

1391
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:27.185
No, that sounds good.

1392
01:43:28.019 --> 01:43:31.940
If you don't blow it, with that,
I can get you in the building.

1393
01:43:32.941 --> 01:43:33.983
Who does what?

1394
01:43:34.067 --> 01:43:38.238
Well, I speak the most
Italian, so I'll be your escort.

1395
01:43:38.321 --> 01:43:41.449
Donowitz speaks second most, so
he'll be your Italian cameraman.

1396
01:43:41.533 --> 01:43:44.536
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.

1397
01:43:45.078 --> 01:43:46.204
I don't speak Italian.

1398
01:43:46.287 --> 01:43:49.666
Like I said, third best. Just
keep your fucking mouth shut.

1399
01:43:49.749 --> 01:43:51.292
In fact, why don't you
start practicing right now?

1400
01:43:59.043 --> 01:44:00.877
You've moved up in the world.

1401
01:44:03.047 --> 01:44:05.048
Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.

1402
01:44:06.384 --> 01:44:10.387
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.

1403
01:44:15.893 --> 01:44:16.893
And that one's name is...

1404
01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:18.061
...Wilhelm Wicki.

1405
01:44:18.855 --> 01:44:21.732
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who
immigrated to the United States...

1406
01:44:21.983 --> 01:44:24.901
...when things began turning sour
for the Israelites.

1407
01:44:25.028 --> 01:44:27.738
They are the two German-born
members of the Basterds.

1408
01:44:28.406 --> 01:44:32.242
They've been known to don German uniforms,
to ambush squads.

1409
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:34.661
What brings you all the way out here?

1410
01:44:40.918 --> 01:44:42.419
But that doesn't look like this.

1411
01:44:45.757 --> 01:44:46.840
This is odd.

1412
01:45:03.107 --> 01:45:04.358
It would appear somebody's missing.

1413
01:45:05.234 --> 01:45:06.610
Somebody fashionable.

1414
01:45:08.446 --> 01:45:09.446
Everybody out!

1415
01:45:23.795 --> 01:45:26.129
"To Max, with love."

1416
01:45:29.509 --> 01:45:32.844
Bridget von Hammersmark.

1417
01:47:18.951 --> 01:47:20.243
Remember... in English.

1418
01:47:20.668 --> 01:47:21.669
Yes.

1419
01:47:22.622 --> 01:47:23.747
Action.

1420
01:47:24.123 --> 01:47:25.290
But how do we get it developed?

1421
01:47:26.584 --> 01:47:29.127
Only a suicidal idiot like
us would develop that footage.

1422
01:47:29.962 --> 01:47:31.963
And suppose someone
would develop the footage...

1423
01:47:32.131 --> 01:47:34.257
...how do we get a 35mm
print with a soundtrack?

1424
01:47:34.592 --> 01:47:38.094
We find somebody who can develop
and process a 35mm print with a soundtrack.

1425
01:47:38.846 --> 01:47:39.930
And we make them do it...

1426
01:47:40.598 --> 01:47:41.723
...or we kill them.

1427
01:47:45.603 --> 01:47:47.437
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.

1428
01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:50.023
You either do what the fuck we tell you...

1429
01:47:50.107 --> 01:47:52.025
...or I'll bury this axe
in your collaborating skull.

1430
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:53.193
I'm not a collaborator.

1431
01:47:53.277 --> 01:47:55.445
Marcel, do his wife and children know you?

1432
01:47:55.571 --> 01:47:56.613
Yes.

1433
01:47:56.697 --> 01:47:59.115
Then after we kill this dog for the Germans...

1434
01:47:59.283 --> 01:48:01.034
...we'll go and silence them.

1435
01:49:41.052 --> 01:49:42.344
Jannings, come on, show the ring.

1436
01:49:42.928 --> 01:49:44.220
Come on, come on. There you go!

1437
01:49:45.264 --> 01:49:49.184
Fredrick, have a look at it.
This is the highest artistic honor that I give.

1438
01:49:49.268 --> 01:49:52.395
Herr Doctor, I'm also feeling very honored.
- You deserve it, my dear Jannings!

1439
01:49:52.563 --> 01:49:55.899
But I believe after the premiere today,
we have a new candidate.

1440
01:50:17.088 --> 01:50:18.213
Ah, Emmanuelle...

1441
01:50:19.256 --> 01:50:22.967
...l'd like you to meet the
greatest actor in the world...

1442
01:50:23.469 --> 01:50:24.552
...Emil Jannings.

1443
01:50:24.929 --> 01:50:28.431
Mademoiselle, I'm pleased to meet you.

1444
01:50:28.891 --> 01:50:29.974
You have a beautiful cinema.

1445
01:50:42.405 --> 01:50:43.446
Thank you, Hermann.

1446
01:51:08.639 --> 01:51:10.432
Fräulein von Hammersmark.

1447
01:51:14.979 --> 01:51:16.646
Colonel Landa, it's been years.

1448
01:51:17.648 --> 01:51:19.607
Dashing as ever, I see.

1449
01:51:22.319 --> 01:51:24.529
So what's happened to your lovely leg?

1450
01:51:25.322 --> 01:51:29.784
A by-product of kicking ass in
the German cinema, no doubt.

1451
01:51:30.453 --> 01:51:32.495
Save your flattery, you old dog.

1452
01:51:32.997 --> 01:51:37.625
I know too many of your former conquests
to fall into that honey pot.

1453
01:51:37.877 --> 01:51:39.169
Seriously, what happened?

1454
01:51:40.337 --> 01:51:43.798
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add...

1455
01:51:45.176 --> 01:51:46.676
...at mountain climbing.

1456
01:51:47.887 --> 01:51:49.053
And this is the result.

1457
01:51:49.305 --> 01:51:50.305
Mountain climbing?

1458
01:51:50.389 --> 01:51:52.515
That's how you injured your leg
- mountain climbing?

1459
01:51:52.641 --> 01:51:54.225
Believe it or not, yes it is.

1460
01:52:18.042 --> 01:52:21.503
Forgive me, Fräulein. I don't mean to
laugh at your misfortune.

1461
01:52:21.587 --> 01:52:23.379
It's just... - mountain climbing?

1462
01:52:24.757 --> 01:52:29.719
I'm curious, Fräulein, what could have ever compelled
you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?

1463
01:52:32.723 --> 01:52:34.933
Well, I shan't be doing it again,
I can tell you that.

1464
01:52:36.894 --> 01:52:38.770
That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustav.

1465
01:52:39.438 --> 01:52:42.023
When were you climbing this mountain,
last night?

1466
01:52:43.567 --> 01:52:44.901
Very good eye, Colonel.

1467
01:52:45.903 --> 01:52:47.570
It happened yesterday morning.

1468
01:52:48.113 --> 01:52:49.948
And where in Paris is this mountain?

1469
01:52:53.786 --> 01:52:56.246
No, I'm just teasing you, Fräulein.

1470
01:52:56.455 --> 01:52:59.207
You know me, I tease rough.

1471
01:52:59.416 --> 01:53:00.959
So, who are your three
handsome escorts?

1472
01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:06.422
I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German.

1473
01:53:07.091 --> 01:53:08.883
They're friends of mine from Italy.

1474
01:53:09.969 --> 01:53:15.139
This is a wonderful Italian
stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi.

1475
01:53:16.809 --> 01:53:19.894
A very talented cameraman,
Antonio Margheriti.

1476
01:53:21.272 --> 01:53:24.399
And Antonio's camera assistant
Dominick Decocco.

1477
01:53:26.277 --> 01:53:31.781
Gentlemen, this is an old friend,
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.

1478
01:53:33.117 --> 01:53:34.158
Hello.

1479
01:53:34.827 --> 01:53:36.786
Gentlemen, it's a pleasure...

1480
01:53:37.121 --> 01:53:40.999
...the friends of our cherished star, admired
by all of us, this outright jewel of our culture...

1481
01:53:41.417 --> 01:53:45.420
...are naturally going to be under my personal
protection for the duration of their stay.

1482
01:53:48.966 --> 01:53:50.008
Thank you.

1483
01:53:50.934 --> 01:53:52.469
Gorlomi?

1484
01:53:52.469 --> 01:53:52.733
Am I saying it correctly?
Gorlomi?

1485
01:53:52.733 --> 01:53:53.803
Am I saying it correctly?

1486
01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:56.848
Yes - 'er, correct.

1487
01:53:59.184 --> 01:54:01.311
Say it for me once please?

1488
01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:04.648
Gorlomi.

1489
01:54:04.648 --> 01:54:05.815
I'm sorry, again?
Gorlomi.

1490
01:54:05.815 --> 01:54:08.201
Gorlomi.

1491
01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:09.777
Once more?

1492
01:54:12.705 --> 01:54:14.457
Gorlomi.

1493
01:54:14.658 --> 01:54:16.159
What's your name again?

1494
01:54:17.001 --> 01:54:18.836
Antonio Margheriti.

1495
01:54:20.205 --> 01:54:21.289
Again?

1496
01:54:21.381 --> 01:54:23.098
Margheriti.

1497
01:54:23.292 --> 01:54:27.045
One more time, but let me
really hear the music in it!

1498
01:54:30.515 --> 01:54:31.850
Margheriti.

1499
01:54:32.217 --> 01:54:33.017
And you?

1500
01:54:33.017 --> 01:54:33.301
And you?
Dominick Decocco.

1501
01:54:33.301 --> 01:54:34.018
Dominick Decocco.

1502
01:54:34.143 --> 01:54:36.521
Dominick Decocco.

1503
01:54:37.890 --> 01:54:40.516
Well, my two cameraman friends
need to find their seats.

1504
01:54:41.226 --> 01:54:43.519
Let me see your tickets.

1505
01:54:45.898 --> 01:54:50.068
I suppose you getting premiere tickets for your
friends wouldn't be the most difficult thing...

1506
01:54:50.194 --> 01:54:51.653
...for a star of your status.

1507
01:54:52.363 --> 01:54:56.074
0023 and 0024.

1508
01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:59.369
That shouldn't be too difficult to find, goodbye.

1509
01:56:19.825 --> 01:56:22.160
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux.

1510
01:56:37.176 --> 01:56:38.801
I have to go down and socialize
with these Hun pigs.

1511
01:56:39.636 --> 01:56:40.845
Let's go over it again.

1512
01:56:42.639 --> 01:56:44.348
Reel one is on the first projector.

1513
01:56:45.476 --> 01:56:46.517
Reel two...

1514
01:56:46.643 --> 01:56:47.643
...is on the second.

1515
01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:49.937
The third one is on the spool.

1516
01:56:52.316 --> 01:56:54.484
And the fourth one is ready to go.

1517
01:56:57.279 --> 01:56:58.863
Okay, the big sniper battle
in the film...

1518
01:56:59.198 --> 01:57:01.491
...begins around the middle
of the third reel.

1519
01:57:02.326 --> 01:57:04.368
Our film comes in on the fourth reel.

1520
01:57:05.162 --> 01:57:07.038
Somewhere towards the end
of the third reel...

1521
01:57:07.164 --> 01:57:08.706
...go down and lock the doors
of the auditorium.

1522
01:57:09.333 --> 01:57:11.667
Then take your place behind the
screen and wait for my cue.

1523
01:57:14.254 --> 01:57:15.713
Then burn it down.

1524
01:57:27.518 --> 01:57:28.518
Take your seats.

1525
01:57:28.602 --> 01:57:30.520
The show is about to begin.

1526
01:57:31.021 --> 01:57:34.232
Everybody, please take your seats.
The show is about to begin.

1527
01:57:35.192 --> 01:57:36.192
We'll see you later.

1528
01:57:36.276 --> 01:57:37.360
Not so fast.

1529
01:57:38.529 --> 01:57:39.695
A glass of champagne...

1530
01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:42.782
...to toast "Nation's Pride."

1531
01:57:50.415 --> 01:57:53.209
My Fräulein, may I have a word
with you in private?

1532
01:57:55.087 --> 01:57:56.212
Certainly.

1533
01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:57.421
Excuse us.

1534
01:58:10.102 --> 01:58:11.561
Have a seat, my Fräulein.

1535
01:58:16.483 --> 01:58:17.567
May I?

1536
01:58:24.575 --> 01:58:26.159
Mademoiselle Mimieux allowed me...

1537
01:58:26.243 --> 01:58:28.661
...to set up camp in her office
for the time being.

1538
01:58:37.629 --> 01:58:39.088
Let me see your foot.

1539
01:58:40.299 --> 01:58:41.424
I beg your pardon?

1540
01:58:42.426 --> 01:58:43.843
Put your foot in my lap.

1541
01:58:49.099 --> 01:58:50.850
Hans, you embarrass me.

1542
01:59:22.132 --> 01:59:26.969
Could you please reach into
the right pocket of my coat...

1543
01:59:27.346 --> 01:59:28.846
...and give me what you find in there.

1544
02:00:03.674 --> 02:00:04.715
May I?

1545
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:25.703
What's that
American expression?

1546
02:00:25.787 --> 02:00:28.206
"If the shoe fits,
you must wear it. "

1547
02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:35.413
What now, Colonel?

1548
02:01:26.673 --> 02:01:28.007
The guy in the white smoking jacket.

1549
02:01:31.686 --> 02:01:36.274
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck. Fuck you!

1550
02:01:36.399 --> 02:01:38.401
Bunch of shithead fuck.

1551
02:01:41.321 --> 02:01:42.864
Fuck you, too!

1552
02:01:45.491 --> 02:01:49.621
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of
bitches! Get your hands off me.

1553
02:01:50.121 --> 02:01:53.625
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you! Get off!

1554
02:01:59.130 --> 02:02:00.256
Hmm.

1555
02:02:00.457 --> 02:02:01.707
Clever.

1556
02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:06.629
I informed the Führer that the
audience has taken their seats.

1557
02:02:06.797 --> 02:02:08.130
He should arrive any minute.

1558
02:02:09.466 --> 02:02:10.508
Thank you, Hans.

1559
02:02:12.185 --> 02:02:13.520
You Jerry-banging,
Limburg-smelling...

1560
02:02:13.678 --> 02:02:14.720
Let go.

1561
02:02:17.774 --> 02:02:20.068
As Stanley said
to Livingstone,

1562
02:02:20.151 --> 02:02:22.320
Lieutenant Aldo Raine,
I presume?

1563
02:02:23.238 --> 02:02:24.614
Hans Landa.

1564
02:02:26.783 --> 02:02:29.160
You've had
a nice long run, Aldo.

1565
02:02:30.078 --> 02:02:32.914
Alas, you're now
in the hands of the SS.

1566
02:02:32.997 --> 02:02:34.541
My hands to be exact.

1567
02:02:34.624 --> 02:02:38.336
And they've been waiting
a long time to touch you.

1568
02:02:42.215 --> 02:02:44.008
Caught you flinching.

1569
02:02:48.221 --> 02:02:50.431
Touch me again,
Kraut-burger.

1570
02:03:06.281 --> 02:03:07.282
Utivich?

1571
02:03:07.365 --> 02:03:08.783
Is that you,
Lieutenant?

1572
02:03:08.867 --> 02:03:09.951
Yeah.

1573
02:03:10.535 --> 02:03:12.620
Do you know
what happened to Donny?

1574
02:03:12.704 --> 02:03:13.830
Omar?

1575
02:03:14.539 --> 02:03:15.540
The woman?

1576
02:03:15.623 --> 02:03:16.875
No, I do not.

1577
02:04:03.421 --> 02:04:06.966
Tell me, Aldo, if I were
sitting where you're sitting,

1578
02:04:07.050 --> 02:04:09.010
would you
show me mercy?

1579
02:04:13.598 --> 02:04:14.724
Nope.

1580
02:04:15.391 --> 02:04:18.645
What is that English
expression about shoes and feet?

1581
02:04:18.728 --> 02:04:22.273
"Looks like the shoe is on the other
foot. " Yeah, I was just thinking that.

1582
02:04:22.516 --> 02:04:23.599
You may leave us.

1583
02:04:25.143 --> 02:04:26.185
But stay alert outside.

1584
02:04:35.328 --> 02:04:38.206
So you're Aldo the Apache.

1585
02:04:39.332 --> 02:04:40.542
So you're The Jew Hunter.

1586
02:04:40.625 --> 02:04:42.335
I'm a detective.

1587
02:04:42.418 --> 02:04:44.295
A damn good detective.

1588
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:46.214
Finding people
is my specialty,

1589
02:04:46.297 --> 02:04:48.716
so naturally, I worked for
the Nazis finding people.

1590
02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:51.928
And, yes, some of them
were Jews. But Jew Hunter?

1591
02:04:53.263 --> 02:04:55.139
J ust a name that stuck.

1592
02:04:55.598 --> 02:04:58.393
Well, you do have to
admit, it is catchy.

1593
02:04:59.853 --> 02:05:03.022
Do you control the nicknames
your enemies bestow on you?

1594
02:05:03.106 --> 02:05:05.608
Aldo the Apache
and the Little Man?

1595
02:05:06.693 --> 02:05:08.820
What do you mean
the Little Man?

1596
02:05:08.903 --> 02:05:10.697
Germans' nickname for you.

1597
02:05:10.780 --> 02:05:13.825
The Germans' nickname for me
is the Little Man?

1598
02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:18.746
And as if to make my point, I'm a little
surprised how tall you were in real life.

1599
02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:21.249
I mean, you're a little fellow,
but not circus-midget little,

1600
02:05:21.332 --> 02:05:23.126
as your reputation
would suggest.

1601
02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:24.752
Where's my men?

1602
02:05:25.295 --> 02:05:27.630
Where's
Bridget von Hammersmark?

1603
02:05:30.508 --> 02:05:33.678
Well, let's just say,
she got what she deserved.

1604
02:05:36.181 --> 02:05:38.683
And when you purchase friends
like Bridget von Hammersmark,

1605
02:05:38.766 --> 02:05:40.768
you get what you pay for.

1606
02:05:42.187 --> 02:05:47.192
Now as far as your paesanos,
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...

1607
02:05:47.275 --> 02:05:49.194
How you know our names?

1608
02:05:49.777 --> 02:05:51.362
Lieutenant Aldo,

1609
02:05:53.239 --> 02:05:54.657
if you don't think
I wouldn't interrogate

1610
02:05:54.741 --> 02:05:58.119
every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors,

1611
02:06:00.538 --> 02:06:04.125
we simply aren't operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed.

1612
02:06:04.209 --> 02:06:05.793
No, I guess not.

1613
02:06:06.002 --> 02:06:11.132
Well, back to the whereabouts
of your two Italian saboteurs.

1614
02:06:14.302 --> 02:06:16.054
As of this moment,

1615
02:06:16.137 --> 02:06:20.975
both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting
in the very seats we left them in.

1616
02:06:21.601 --> 02:06:25.230
Double-zero 23 and double-zero
24, if my memory serves.

1617
02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:29.400
Explosives still around their
ankles, still ready to explode.

1618
02:06:29.484 --> 02:06:32.737
And your mission, some
would call a terrorist plot,

1619
02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:35.323
as of this moment,
is still a go.

1620
02:06:35.406 --> 02:06:38.743
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next? Eliza on Ice?

1621
02:06:38.826 --> 02:06:40.078
However,

1622
02:06:41.955 --> 02:06:45.083
all I have to do is pick up
this phone right here,

1623
02:06:45.166 --> 02:06:48.002
inform the cinema,
and your plan is kaput.

1624
02:06:50.421 --> 02:06:55.635
If they're still here, and if they're
still alive, and that's one big if,

1625
02:06:56.970 --> 02:06:58.763
there ain't no way you're
going to take them boys

1626
02:06:58.847 --> 02:07:00.473
without setting off
them bombs.

1627
02:07:00.557 --> 02:07:02.308
I have no doubt.

1628
02:07:02.392 --> 02:07:05.687
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.

1629
02:07:05.770 --> 02:07:08.690
And, yes, Goebbels will be
very, very, very mad at you

1630
02:07:08.773 --> 02:07:10.859
for what you've done
to his big night.

1631
02:07:12.110 --> 02:07:14.404
But you won't get Hitler,
you won't get Goebbels,

1632
02:07:14.487 --> 02:07:17.532
you won't get Goring,
and you won't get Bormann.

1633
02:07:17.615 --> 02:07:20.201
And you need all four
to end the war.

1634
02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:25.039
But if I don't pick up
this phone right here,

1635
02:07:25.123 --> 02:07:27.458
you may very well
get all four.

1636
02:07:28.710 --> 02:07:33.548
And if you get all four,
you end the war

1637
02:07:34.799 --> 02:07:36.050
tonight.

1638
02:07:37.427 --> 02:07:38.970
So, gentlemen,

1639
02:07:39.679 --> 02:07:42.891
let's discuss the prospect
of ending the war tonight.

1640
02:07:45.810 --> 02:07:47.645
So, the way I see it,

1641
02:07:47.729 --> 02:07:51.941
since Hitler's death or possible
rescue rests solely on my reaction,

1642
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:54.194
if I do nothing,

1643
02:07:54.611 --> 02:07:57.322
it's as if I'm causing his
death even more than yourselves.

1644
02:07:57.405 --> 02:07:58.656
Wouldn't you agree?

1645
02:07:59.324 --> 02:08:00.658
I guess so.

1646
02:08:03.244 --> 02:08:05.246
How about you,
Utivich?

1647
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:06.956
I guess so, too.

1648
02:08:12.503 --> 02:08:13.755
Gentlemen,
I have no intention

1649
02:08:13.838 --> 02:08:16.925
of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and
killing Goring and killing Bormann,

1650
02:08:17.008 --> 02:08:19.761
not to mention winning the war
single-handedly for the Allies,

1651
02:08:19.844 --> 02:08:23.598
only later to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.

1652
02:08:25.683 --> 02:08:29.229
If you want to win
the war tonight,

1653
02:08:30.855 --> 02:08:33.024
we have to make a deal.

1654
02:08:36.027 --> 02:08:37.779
What kind of deal?

1655
02:08:37.862 --> 02:08:40.406
The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.

1656
02:08:40.490 --> 02:08:45.036
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has
a commanding officer.

1657
02:08:46.037 --> 02:08:47.372
A general.

1658
02:08:48.039 --> 02:08:49.707
I'm betting for...

1659
02:08:51.417 --> 02:08:53.336
OSS would be my guess.

1660
02:08:57.257 --> 02:08:59.717
That's a bingo!

1661
02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:05.223
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo. "

1662
02:09:05.306 --> 02:09:07.183
You just say, "Bingo. "

1663
02:09:07.267 --> 02:09:09.519
Bingo! How fun.

1664
02:09:11.938 --> 02:09:15.024
But I digress. Where were we?
Yeah! Make a deal.

1665
02:09:15.567 --> 02:09:19.988
Over there is a very capable
two-way radio and sitting behind it

1666
02:09:20.071 --> 02:09:24.242
is a more than capable
radio operator named Hermann.

1667
02:09:24.576 --> 02:09:26.911
Get me someone on the other end
of that radio

1668
02:09:26.995 --> 02:09:30.039
with the power of the pen
to authorize my,

1669
02:09:30.123 --> 02:09:33.042
let's call it, the terms of my
conditional surrender.

1670
02:09:33.126 --> 02:09:35.545
If that tastes better
going down.

1671
02:09:36.337 --> 02:09:37.589
You know,
where I'm from...

1672
02:09:37.672 --> 02:09:39.549
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?

1673
02:09:39.632 --> 02:09:41.676
Maynardville,
Tennessee.

1674
02:09:41.759 --> 02:09:44.220
I've done my share
of bootlegging.

1675
02:09:44.429 --> 02:09:48.099
U p there, if you engage in what the federal
government calls illegal activity,

1676
02:09:48.183 --> 02:09:50.310
but what we call just a man trying to
make a living for his family

1677
02:09:50.393 --> 02:09:54.814
selling moonshine liquor, it behooves
oneself to keep his wits.

1678
02:09:56.774 --> 02:10:00.195
Long story short, we hear a story
too good to be true,

1679
02:10:00.862 --> 02:10:02.113
it ain't.

1680
02:10:03.948 --> 02:10:06.701
Sitting in your chair, I would probably
say the same thing,

1681
02:10:06.784 --> 02:10:11.497
and 999,999 times out of a million,
you would be correct.

1682
02:10:13.499 --> 02:10:17.086
But in the pages of history,
every once in a while,

1683
02:10:17.670 --> 02:10:21.049
fate reaches out
and extends its hand.

1684
02:10:27.889 --> 02:10:29.849
What shall
the history books read?

1685
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:59.921
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.

1686
02:11:01.339 --> 02:11:02.966
Sarge, that tower...

1687
02:11:22.527 --> 02:11:24.445
The tower stands!

1688
02:11:26.689 --> 02:11:27.731
Gum?

1689
02:11:31.578 --> 02:11:34.080
Psst! Psst!

1690
02:12:14.904 --> 02:12:15.988
It's time.

1691
02:12:17.782 --> 02:12:20.575
I should go lock the auditorium and
take my place behind the screen.

1692
02:14:04.189 --> 02:14:06.357
So when the military history
of this night is written,

1693
02:14:06.441 --> 02:14:10.111
it will be recorded that I was part
of Operation Kino

1694
02:14:10.195 --> 02:14:12.989
from the very beginning
as a double agent.

1695
02:14:13.072 --> 02:14:17.118
Anything I've done in my guise
as an SS Colonel

1696
02:14:17.202 --> 02:14:20.246
was sanctioned by the OSS
as a necessary evil

1697
02:14:20.330 --> 02:14:23.041
to establish my cover
with the Germans.

1698
02:14:23.249 --> 02:14:26.544
And it was my placement of
Lieutenant Raine's dynamite

1699
02:14:26.628 --> 02:14:29.589
in Hitler and Goebbels'
opera box that assured their demise.

1700
02:14:30.623 --> 02:14:33.291
I informed the Führer that the
audience has taken their seats.

1701
02:14:33.376 --> 02:14:34.751
He should arrive any minute.

1702
02:14:36.212 --> 02:14:37.212
Thank you, Hans.

1703
02:14:46.731 --> 02:14:49.734
By the way, that last part
is actually true.

1704
02:14:49.817 --> 02:14:54.739
I want my full military pension and benefits
under my proper rank.

1705
02:14:55.073 --> 02:14:57.492
I want to receive the Congressional
Medal of Honor

1706
02:14:57.575 --> 02:15:01.538
for my invaluable assistance in the toppling
of the Third Reich.

1707
02:15:02.956 --> 02:15:06.042
In fact, I want all the members of
Operation Kino

1708
02:15:06.125 --> 02:15:09.087
to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

1709
02:15:09.462 --> 02:15:13.174
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.

1710
02:15:13.466 --> 02:15:16.678
And I would like
the United States of America

1711
02:15:16.761 --> 02:15:20.849
to purchase property for me
on Nantucket Island

1712
02:15:20.932 --> 02:15:24.185
as a reward for all the countless lives
I've saved

1713
02:15:24.269 --> 02:15:26.604
by bringing the tyranny
of the National Socialist Party

1714
02:15:26.688 --> 02:15:30.316
to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?

1715
02:15:32.110 --> 02:15:35.572
I look forward to seeing you
face to face as well, sir.

1716
02:15:36.447 --> 02:15:38.658
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.

1717
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:43.079
Yes, sir.

1718
02:15:43.162 --> 02:15:46.916
Colonel Landa will put you and Private
Utivich in a truck as prisoners.

1719
02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.379
Then he and his radio operator will
get in the truck and drive to our lines.

1720
02:15:51.462 --> 02:15:56.050
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa
and his man will surrender to you.

1721
02:15:56.134 --> 02:15:58.678
You will then take over
driving of the truck

1722
02:15:58.761 --> 02:16:02.140
and bring them straight to me for
debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?

1723
02:16:02.223 --> 02:16:03.349
Yes, sir.

1724
02:16:03.433 --> 02:16:04.893
Over and out.

1725
02:16:29.408 --> 02:16:32.744
Herr Dr, Goebbels, excuse me.
Could I go out for a moment?

1726
02:16:33.663 --> 02:16:37.040
Perfectly understandable, my boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after the show.

1727
02:17:44.567 --> 02:17:45.608
Who is it?

1728
02:17:45.943 --> 02:17:46.985
Fredrick!

1729
02:17:48.446 --> 02:17:49.487
Shit.

1730
02:17:54.076 --> 02:17:56.286
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back.

1731
02:17:56.746 --> 02:17:58.246
That actor in the movie stinks.

1732
02:18:00.583 --> 02:18:01.666
What are you doing here?

1733
02:18:01.917 --> 02:18:02.959
I came to visit you.

1734
02:18:04.295 --> 02:18:05.337
Can't you see how busy I am?

1735
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:07.130
Then allow me to lend an assist.

1736
02:18:08.424 --> 02:18:10.258
Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.

1737
02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:13.511
This is your premiere,
you need to be out there with them.

1738
02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:17.766
Normally, you would be right.

1739
02:18:18.934 --> 02:18:20.268
And for all the other films I do...

1740
02:18:20.936 --> 02:18:23.772
...I intend to endure evenings like tonight,
in the proper spirit.

1741
02:18:25.941 --> 02:18:27.150
However, the fact remains...

1742
02:18:28.277 --> 02:18:30.362
...this film is based
on my military exploits.

1743
02:18:30.988 --> 02:18:34.616
And in this case,
my exploits consisted of killing many men.

1744
02:18:36.118 --> 02:18:38.119
Consequently, the part of
the film that's playing now...

1745
02:18:40.539 --> 02:18:41.956
...I don't like watching this part.

1746
02:18:43.793 --> 02:18:45.627
I am sorry, Fredrick, but...
- So, I thought...

1747
02:18:45.961 --> 02:18:48.171
...l'd come up here
and do what I do best...

1748
02:18:48.506 --> 02:18:49.631
...annoy you.

1749
02:18:50.633 --> 02:18:53.635
And from the look on your face,
it would appear I haven't lost my touch.

1750
02:18:55.304 --> 02:18:57.263
Are you so used to
the Nazis kissing your ass...

1751
02:18:57.348 --> 02:18:58.848
...you've forgotten what
the word "no" means?

1752
02:18:59.475 --> 02:19:01.393
No... you can't be here!

1753
02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:02.644
Now go away!

1754
02:19:05.564 --> 02:19:06.648
Fredrick, you hurt me.

1755
02:19:06.982 --> 02:19:11.319
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.

1756
02:19:12.154 --> 02:19:13.988
Even if it's just physical pain.

1757
02:19:14.657 --> 02:19:16.533
I'm not a man you say, "go away" to.

1758
02:19:17.576 --> 02:19:21.746
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Italy,
that if they could, would testify to that!

1759
02:19:24.375 --> 02:19:25.542
After what I've done for you...

1760
02:19:25.918 --> 02:19:28.002
...you disrespect me at your peril!

1761
02:19:28.337 --> 02:19:29.421
Lock the door.

1762
02:19:29.964 --> 02:19:31.005
What?

1763
02:19:32.299 --> 02:19:33.341
Lock the door.

1764
02:19:33.426 --> 02:19:34.509
We don't have much time.

1765
02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:38.763
Time for what?

1766
02:19:39.682 --> 02:19:40.765
Forget it!

1767
02:19:41.016 --> 02:19:42.183
No, no, no... wait.

1768
02:19:43.853 --> 02:19:45.812
You want me to... lock the door?

1769
02:19:46.522 --> 02:19:47.689
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.

1770
02:21:49.070 --> 02:21:51.656
When I kill that guy,
you got 30 feet to get to that guard.

1771
02:21:51.739 --> 02:21:53.700
Can you do it?
I have to.

1772
02:22:23.938 --> 02:22:25.273
Champagne?

1773
02:22:47.036 --> 02:22:49.037
Extraordinary my dear,
simply extraordinary!

1774
02:22:49.538 --> 02:22:50.872
This is your finest film yet.

1775
02:22:52.875 --> 02:22:54.208
Thank you, my Führer.

1776
02:22:56.378 --> 02:22:57.420
Thank you.

1777
02:23:17.116 --> 02:23:19.827
Who wants to send
a message to Germany?

1778
02:23:20.662 --> 02:23:22.997
I have a message
for Germany.

1779
02:23:26.459 --> 02:23:28.711
That you are
all going to die.

1780
02:23:29.787 --> 02:23:31.120
Enough! Stop it!

1781
02:23:31.246 --> 02:23:32.288
Turn off the projector!

1782
02:23:32.465 --> 02:23:37.887
And I want you to look deep into the face of
the Jew who's going to do it!

1783
02:23:38.087 --> 02:23:39.962
I don't know what's going on.
That does not belong in my movie!

1784
02:23:39.973 --> 02:23:43.059
Marcel, burn it down.

1785
02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:45.562
Oui, Shosanna.

1786
02:24:21.014 --> 02:24:23.141
My name
is Shosanna Dreyfus,

1787
02:24:23.516 --> 02:24:25.101
and this is the face

1788
02:24:27.061 --> 02:24:29.397
of Jewish vengeance.

1789
02:26:25.462 --> 02:26:27.922
These are the American lines, Colonel sir.

1790
02:26:35.064 --> 02:26:36.858
Hermann,
uncuff them.

1791
02:26:55.502 --> 02:26:59.506
I'm officially surrendering myself over
to you, Lieutenant Raine.

1792
02:27:00.632 --> 02:27:02.425
We're your prisoners.

1793
02:27:03.259 --> 02:27:04.969
How about my knife?

1794
02:27:10.934 --> 02:27:12.894
Thank you very much,
Colonel.

1795
02:27:12.977 --> 02:27:16.064
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands
behind his back.

1796
02:27:16.147 --> 02:27:18.358
Is that really
necessary?

1797
02:27:18.441 --> 02:27:20.527
I'm a slave
to appearances.

1798
02:27:23.696 --> 02:27:25.198
Scalp Hermann.

1799
02:27:26.866 --> 02:27:28.535
Are you mad?

1800
02:27:28.910 --> 02:27:30.662
What have you done?

1801
02:27:31.162 --> 02:27:34.499
I made a deal with your general
for that man's life!

1802
02:27:35.583 --> 02:27:38.962
Yeah, they made that deal. But they don't
give a fuck about him. They need you.

1803
02:27:39.045 --> 02:27:41.005
You'll be shot for this!

1804
02:27:41.673 --> 02:27:45.176
Nah, I don't think so. More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.

1805
02:27:46.511 --> 02:27:50.682
You know, Utivich and myself heard that
deal you made with the brass.

1806
02:27:51.140 --> 02:27:52.892
End the war tonight?

1807
02:27:54.310 --> 02:27:55.854
I'd make that deal.

1808
02:27:55.937 --> 02:27:57.772
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?

1809
02:27:57.856 --> 02:27:58.857
I'd make that deal.

1810
02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:01.442
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.

1811
02:28:02.193 --> 02:28:05.321
And that pretty little nest
you feathered for yourself.

1812
02:28:05.405 --> 02:28:08.783
Well, if you're willing to barbecue
the whole High Command,

1813
02:28:08.867 --> 02:28:11.870
I suppose that's worth
certain considerations.

1814
02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:14.706
But I do have
one question.

1815
02:28:15.790 --> 02:28:18.543
When you get to your little place
on Nantucket Island,

1816
02:28:18.626 --> 02:28:23.173
I imagine you are going to take off that
handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.

1817
02:28:23.256 --> 02:28:24.591
Ain't you?

1818
02:28:28.553 --> 02:28:30.430
That's what I thought.

1819
02:28:31.181 --> 02:28:33.057
Now, that I can't abide.

1820
02:28:34.475 --> 02:28:36.769
How about you, Utivich,
can you abide it?

1821
02:28:36.853 --> 02:28:38.730
Not one damn bit, sir.

1822
02:28:40.356 --> 02:28:42.442
I mean,
if I had my way,

1823
02:28:42.942 --> 02:28:47.405
you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest
of your pecker-sucking life.

1824
02:28:48.907 --> 02:28:49.908
But I'm aware
that ain't practical.

1825
02:28:49.991 --> 02:28:53.036
I mean, at some point, you're
going to have to take it off.

1826
02:28:53.119 --> 02:28:54.245
So,

1827
02:28:55.205 --> 02:28:58.917
I'm going to give you a little
something you can't take off.

1828
02:29:23.858 --> 02:29:25.985
You know something,
Utivich?

1829
02:29:26.361 --> 02:29:29.155
I think this just might be
my masterpiece.
