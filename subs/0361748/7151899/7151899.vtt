Chapter One

2
00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:57.200
Once upon a time...

3
00:01:57.326 --> 00:02:02.706
in Nazi-occupied France

4
00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:12.674
1941

5
00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:46.416
Go back inside and shut the door.

6
00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:51.880
Julie, get me some water
for my wash up...

7
00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:54.549
...then get inside with your sisters.

8
00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:22.411
Ready, Papa.

9
00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:33.505
Thank you, my darling...

10
00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.465
...now you go inside with your sisters.

11
00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.138
Don't run.

12
00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:05.829
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

13
00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.330
I am Perrier LaPadite.

14
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.835
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Monsieur LaPadite...

15
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.296
...I am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.

16
00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.006
What can I do for you?

17
00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:19.342
I was hoping you could invite me
inside your home...

18
00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.887
...and we may have a discussion.

19
00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:24.848
Certainly. After you.

20
00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:36.693
Colonel Landa, this is my family.

21
00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.038
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS...

22
00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:49.539
...Mademoiselle...

23
00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:50.874
...at your service.

24
00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:56.046
The rumors I have heard in the
village about your family are all true.

25
00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.927
Each one of your daughters
is more lovely than the last.

26
00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:04.221
Merci.

27
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.515
Please...

28
00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:08.266
...have a seat.

29
00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:15.899
Suzanne, would you be so good as to
get the Colonel some wine?

30
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.401
But no.

31
00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.904
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite,
but no wine.

32
00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:26.743
This being a dairy farm, one would be
safe in assuming you have milk?

33
00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:27.911
Oui.

34
00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.412
Then milk is what I prefer.

35
00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:30.872
Very well.

36
00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:33.625
Julie, would you mind closing the window?

37
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.105
Merci.

38
00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:15.125
Monsieur, to both your family
and your cows...

39
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.836
...I say, "Bravo."

40
00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:19.963
Thank you.

41
00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:24.009
Please join me at your table.

42
00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:25.969
Very well.

43
00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:32.475
Monsieur LaPadite...

44
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.480
...what we have to discuss
would be better discussed in private.

45
00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:41.234
You'll notice I left my men outdoors.

46
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.240
If it wouldn't offend them, could you
ask your lovely ladies to step outside?

47
00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.076
You are right.

48
00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.246
Charlotte, would you take the girls
outside?

49
00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.707
The Colonel and I need to have
a few words.

50
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:08.929
Monsieur LaPadite...

51
00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:15.352
...I regret to inform you
I've exhausted the extent of my French.

52
00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:20.398
To continue to speak it so inadequately
would only serve to embarrass me.

53
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.527
However, I've been led to believe
you speak English quite well.

54
00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:26.863
Yes.

55
00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:31.117
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house...

56
00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.870
...I ask your permission to switch
to English...

57
00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:35.705
...for the remainder of the conversation.

58
00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:38.041
By all means.

59
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.544
While I'm very familiar
with you and your family,

60
00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:45.256
I have no way of knowing
if you are familiar with who I am.

61
00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.385
Are you aware of my existence?

62
00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.596
-Yes.
-This is good.

63
00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:56.226
Now, are you aware of the job I've been
ordered to carry out in France?

64
00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:59.646
Yes.

65
00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.315
Please tell me what you've heard.

66
00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:04.567
I've heard

67
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:09.447
that the Führer has put you in charge
of rounding up the Jews left in France

68
00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.450
who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.

69
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.788
The Führer couldn't have
said it better himself.

70
00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:22.419
But the meaning of your visit,

71
00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:27.090
pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.

72
00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.970
The Germans looked through my house
nine months ago for hiding Jews

73
00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.722
and found nothing.

74
00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.142
I'm aware of that.

75
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.103
I've read the reports of this area.

76
00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:45.400
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

77
00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:48.570
there is always
a slight duplication of efforts,

78
00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:54.451
most of it being a complete waste of time,
but needs to be done nevertheless.

79
00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:58.496
I just have a few questions,
monsieur LaPadite.

80
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.292
If you can assist me with answers,

81
00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:05.462
my department can close
the file on your family.

82
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.096
Now,

83
00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:21.019
before the occupation,
there were four Jewish families in this area,

84
00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.938
all dairy farmers like yourself.

85
00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:30.361
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts

86
00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.823
and the Dreyfuses.

87
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.617
Is that correct?

88
00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:36.785
To my knowledge,

89
00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:40.330
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.

90
00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:44.209
Herr Colonel,
would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?

91
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:45.794
Please, monsieur LaPadite,

92
00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.838
this is your house,
make yourself comfortable.

93
00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:52.133
Now, according to these papers,

94
00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:56.513
all the Jewish families
in this area have been accounted for

95
00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:59.390
except the Dreyfuses.

96
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.312
Somewhere in the last year
it would appear they've vanished.

97
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:07.690
Which leads me to the conclusion
that they've either made good their escape

98
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:10.652
or someone
is very successfully hiding them.

99
00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:15.490
What have you heard about
the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?

100
00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.909
-Only rumors.
-I love rumors!

101
00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:20.870
Facts could be so misleading,

102
00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:24.165
where rumors, true or false,
are often revealing.

103
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.042
So, monsieur LaPadite,

104
00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:29.379
what rumors have you heard
regarding the Dreyfuses?

105
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.343
Again, this is just a rumor,

106
00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:41.724
but we heard the Dreyfuses
had made their way into Spain.

107
00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:52.402
So, the rumors you've heard
have been of escape?

108
00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:55.071
Yes.

109
00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:02.412
Having never met the Dreyfuses,
would you confirm for me

110
00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:05.748
the exact members of the household
and their names?

111
00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:13.214
There were five of them.

112
00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:18.094
The father, Jacob.

113
00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.432
Wife, Miriam.

114
00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:28.104
And her brother, Bob.

115
00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:36.821
How old is Bob?

116
00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:39.782
Thirty, Thirty-one.

117
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.288
Continue.

118
00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.290
And the children,

119
00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:50.126
Amos

120
00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:53.755
and Shosanna.

121
00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.675
Ages of the children?

122
00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:08.353
Amos was nine or 10.

123
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.734
-And Shosanna?
-And Shosanna was

124
00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:20.198
18 or 19. I'm not really sure.

125
00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.378
Well, I guess that should do it.

126
00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:44.180
However, before I go, could I have
another glass of your delicious milk?

127
00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:48.726
But of course.

128
00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.527
Monsieur LaPadite,

129
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.614
are you aware of the nickname
the people of France have given me?

130
00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.704
I have no interest in such things.

131
00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.416
But you are aware of what they call me.

132
00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:15.378
I'm aware.

133
00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:18.923
What are you aware of?

134
00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:32.061
-That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
-Precisely.

135
00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:36.983
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.

136
00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.402
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker

137
00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:42.071
the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.

138
00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:45.408
Actually, why he would hate the name
"the Hangman" is baffling to me.

139
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:48.911
It would appear he has done
everything in his power to earn it.

140
00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:52.248
Now I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title

141
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.667
precisely because I've earned it.

142
00:13:56.085 --> 00:14:00.173
The feature that makes me
such an effective hunter of the Jews is,

143
00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.925
as opposed to most German soldiers,

144
00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:05.011
I can think like a Jew

145
00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:08.431
where they can only think like a German.

146
00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:11.517
More precisely, a German soldier.

147
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.820
Now, if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast,

148
00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:26.949
it would be the cunning
and the predatory instinct of a hawk.

149
00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:31.287
But if one were to determine what attributes
the Jews share with a beast,

150
00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:33.456
it would be that of the rat.

151
00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:40.129
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing.

152
00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:43.174
But where our conclusions differ,

153
00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:46.302
is I don't consider the comparison an insult.

154
00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:52.642
Consider for a moment
the world a rat lives in.

155
00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.686
It's a hostile world, indeed.

156
00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:59.982
If a rat were to scamper
through your front door, right now,

157
00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:02.485
would you greet it with hostility?

158
00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.321
I suppose I would.

159
00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:10.326
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create
this animosity you feel toward them?

160
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.830
Rats spread disease. They bite people.

161
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.167
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,
but that's some time ago.

162
00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:20.837
I propose to you any disease
a rat could spread,

163
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.381
a squirrel could equally carry.

164
00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.091
Would you agree?

165
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.512
Yet, I assume you don't share
the same animosity with squirrels

166
00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.348
-that you do with rats, do you?
-No.

167
00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:35.351
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?

168
00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:39.355
And except for the tail,
they even rather look alike, don't they?

169
00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:42.608
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.

170
00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:45.361
However interesting as the thought may be,

171
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:48.698
it makes not one bit of difference
to how you feel.

172
00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:55.121
If a rat were to walk in here, right now,
as I'm talking

173
00:15:56.247 --> 00:16:00.126
would you greet it with a saucer
of your delicious milk?

174
00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:01.669
Probably not.

175
00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:04.005
I didn't think so.

176
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.174
You don't like them.

177
00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:08.176
You don't really know
why you don't like them.

178
00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.970
All you know is you find them repulsive.

179
00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:16.267
Consequently, a German soldier
conducts a search

180
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.853
of a house suspected of hiding Jews.

181
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.355
Where does the hawk look?

182
00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:24.650
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic,
he looks in the cellar,

183
00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:27.153
he looks everywhere he would hide.

184
00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:32.283
But there are so many places
it would never occur to a hawk to hide.

185
00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:38.206
However, the reason the Führer
has brought me off my Alps in Austria

186
00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:42.710
and placed me in French cow country today
is because it does occur to me.

187
00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:47.340
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats
human beings are capable of

188
00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:49.425
once they abandon dignity.

189
00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:53.346
May I smoke my pipe as well?

190
00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:58.559
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.

191
00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:16.410
Now, my job dictates

192
00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:24.418
that I must have my men enter your home

193
00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.258
and conduct a thorough search

194
00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:34.095
before I can officially cross
your family's name off my list.

195
00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:38.766
And if there are any irregularities
to be found, rest assured they will be.

196
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:41.060
That is unless you have something to tell me

197
00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:44.146
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.

198
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.482
I might add, also, that any information

199
00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:51.237
that makes the performance of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.

200
00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:55.616
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.

201
00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:57.451
And that reward will be,

202
00:17:57.535 --> 00:18:00.288
your family will cease
to be harassed in any way

203
00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:04.792
by the German military during the rest
of our occupation of your country.

204
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:18.806
You're sheltering enemies of the state,
are you not?

205
00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:25.229
Yes.

206
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:32.069
You're sheltering them underneath
your floorboards, aren't you?

207
00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:35.698
Yes.

208
00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:41.537
Point out to me the areas
where they're hiding.

209
00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:03.934
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,

210
00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:07.730
I assume, while they're listening,
they don't speak English.

211
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:10.733
Yes.

212
00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:15.613
I'm going to switch back to French now,
and I want you to follow my masquerade.

213
00:19:15.696 --> 00:19:17.198
Is that clear?

214
00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.201
Yes.

215
00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:23.579
Monsieur LaPadite...

216
00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:28.292
...I thank you for the milk...

217
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:31.295
...and your hospitality.

218
00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:36.008
I do believe our business here is done.

219
00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:42.264
Ah, ladies.

220
00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:48.521
I thank you for your time.

221
00:19:51.065 --> 00:19:52.733
We shan't be bothering your family
any longer.

222
00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:54.819
So, Monsieur...

223
00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:56.904
...Mademoiselle.

224
00:19:57.405 --> 00:20:00.241
I bid farewell to you and say...

225
00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:01.867
...adieu.

226
00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:23.222
It's the girl.

227
00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:12.021
Au revoir, Shosanna!

228
00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.783
Chapter Two

229
00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:25.826
INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS

230
00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:28.829
ALDO: Ten-hut!

231
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:37.588
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.

232
00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:41.634
And I'm putting together a special team,
and I need me eight soldiers.

233
00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:44.845
Eight Jewish American soldiers.

234
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:49.391
Now, you all might've heard rumors
about the armada happening soon.

235
00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:52.186
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.

236
00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:56.690
We're going to be dropped into France
dressed as civilians.

237
00:21:57.274 --> 00:21:59.610
Once we're in enemy territory,

238
00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:02.196
as a bushwhacking guerrilla army,

239
00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:05.616
we're going to be doing one thing
and one thing only.

240
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.618
Killing Nazis.

241
00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:11.247
I don't know about you all,

242
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.250
but I sure as hell didn't come down
from the goddamn Smoky Mountains,

243
00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:18.295
cross 5,000 miles of water,
fight my way through half of Sicily

244
00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:22.758
and jump out of a fucking aeroplane
to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.

245
00:22:22.842 --> 00:22:24.927
Nazi ain't got no humanity.

246
00:22:25.636 --> 00:22:29.181
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating,
mass-murdering maniac

247
00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:31.475
and they need to be destroyed.

248
00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:36.230
That's why any and every son of a bitch
we find wearing a Nazi uniform,

249
00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:38.482
they're going to die.

250
00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:44.905
Now, I'm the direct descendent
of the mountain man Jim Bridger.

251
00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:47.157
That means I got a little Indian in me.

252
00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:51.453
And our battle plan
will be that of an Apache resistance.

253
00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:54.832
We will be cruel to the Germans.

254
00:22:55.249 --> 00:22:58.502
And through our cruelty,
they will know who we are.

255
00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:00.963
And they will find the evidence
of our cruelty

256
00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:02.965
in the disembowelled, dismembered

257
00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:06.719
and disfigured bodies of their brothers
we leave behind us.

258
00:23:06.844 --> 00:23:09.346
And the German won't be able
to help themselves

259
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.142
but imagine the cruelty their brothers
endured at our hands,

260
00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:17.229
and our boot heels
and the edge of our knives.

261
00:23:18.606 --> 00:23:20.983
And the German will be sickened by us.

262
00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:23.277
And the German will talk about us.

263
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.529
And the German will fear us.

264
00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.574
And when the German
closes their eyes at night

265
00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:31.952
and they're tortured by their subconscious
for the evil they have done,

266
00:23:32.036 --> 00:23:35.706
it will be with thoughts of us
that they are tortured with.

267
00:23:37.291 --> 00:23:38.459
Sound good?

268
00:23:38.542 --> 00:23:40.169
-ALL: Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

269
00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:43.297
That's what I like to hear.

270
00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:47.343
But I got a word of warning
for all you would-be warriors.

271
00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:50.304
When you join my command,
you take on debit.

272
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:53.307
A debit you owe me, personally.

273
00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:59.855
Each and every man under my command
owes me 100 Nazi scalps.

274
00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:02.358
And I want my scalps.

275
00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:08.489
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps
taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.

276
00:24:10.074 --> 00:24:11.992
Or you will die trying!

277
00:24:13.327 --> 00:24:14.703
No,no,no,no,no,no,no!

278
00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:18.374
How much more of these Jew swine
must I endure?

279
00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:21.877
They butcher my men like they were flies!

280
00:24:23.087 --> 00:24:25.714
Do you know the latest rumor
they've conjured up

281
00:24:25.798 --> 00:24:29.093
in their fear-induced delirium?

282
00:24:29.385 --> 00:24:30.469
The one...

283
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:33.764
...that beats my boys with a bat!

284
00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:36.934
The one they call "The Bear Jew"...

285
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:38.227
...is a Golem!

286
00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:40.562
My Führer, this is just soldiers' gossip.

287
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:46.110
No one really believes "The Bear Jew"
is a Golem.

288
00:24:46.402 --> 00:24:47.486
Why not?

289
00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:50.739
They seem to be able to elude capture
like an apparition.

290
00:24:52.616 --> 00:24:55.411
They seem to be able to appear and
disappear at will.

291
00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:59.748
You want to prove they're flesh and blood?

292
00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:02.251
Then bring them to me!

293
00:25:04.086 --> 00:25:08.090
I will hang them naked, by their heels,
from the Eiffel Tower!

294
00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:12.261
And then throw their bodies in the sewers...

295
00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:15.931
...for the rats of Paris to feast!

296
00:25:20.102 --> 00:25:21.145
Kliest!

297
00:25:22.438 --> 00:25:23.439
Yes, my Führer!

298
00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:28.444
I have an order I want relayed to all
German soldiers stationed in France.

299
00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:32.781
The Jew degenerate
known as "The Bear Jew,"

300
00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:35.951
henceforth, is never to be referred
to as The Bear Jew again.

301
00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:38.287
Yes, my Führer!

302
00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:40.289
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?

303
00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:42.458
Who and what is a Private Butz?

304
00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:45.127
He's the soldier
you wanted to see personally.

305
00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:49.006
His squad was ambushed
by Lt. Raine's Jews.

306
00:25:49.298 --> 00:25:50.966
He was its only survivor.

307
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.636
Indeed, I do want to see him.
Thank you for reminding me.

308
00:25:54.803 --> 00:25:55.846
Send him in.

309
00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:08.984
Sergeant Rachtmann, Ludwig and I

310
00:26:09.068 --> 00:26:11.987
were the only ones left alive
after the ambush.

311
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.493
While one man guarded us,
the rest removed the hair.

312
00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:55.823
Hey, Hirschberg.

313
00:26:56.532 --> 00:26:58.242
Send that Kraut sarge over.

314
00:26:58.367 --> 00:26:59.868
HIRSCHBERG: You. Go.

315
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.696
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.

316
00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:39.199
Lieutenant Aldo Raine. Pleased to meet you.

317
00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:41.743
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?

318
00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:43.620
-Yes.
-Then sit down.

319
00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:48.417
How is your English, Werner?

320
00:27:48.542 --> 00:27:51.420
Because if need be, we got
a couple of fellows who can translate.

321
00:27:51.545 --> 00:27:52.629
Wicki here,

322
00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:55.966
an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out
of Munich while the getting was good.

323
00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:59.928
Became American, got drafted,
come back to give y'all what for.

324
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.140
Another one up there
you might be familiar with.

325
00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:05.100
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.

326
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:08.729
Heard of him?

327
00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:12.774
Everybody in the German Army
has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.

328
00:28:23.452 --> 00:28:25.329
MALE NARRA TOR: The reason
for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity

329
00:28:25.454 --> 00:28:27.623
among German soldiers is simple.

330
00:28:27.664 --> 00:28:33.295
As a German-enlisted man,
he killed 13 Gestapo officers.

331
00:28:47.643 --> 00:28:50.646
Instead of putting him up against a wall,

332
00:28:50.687 --> 00:28:53.523
the High Command
decided to send him back to Berlin

333
00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:55.108
to be made an example of.

334
00:28:56.652 --> 00:29:00.364
Needless to say,
once the Basterds heard about him,

335
00:29:00.697 --> 00:29:02.366
he never got there.

336
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:41.280
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?

337
00:29:43.949 --> 00:29:46.660
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.

338
00:29:46.702 --> 00:29:48.370
Ever heard of us?

339
00:29:50.372 --> 00:29:52.958
We just want to say
we're a big fan of your work.

340
00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:54.293
When it comes to killing Nazis,

341
00:29:57.462 --> 00:29:59.715
I think you show great talent.

342
00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:03.552
And I pride myself for having an eye
for that kind of talent.

343
00:30:07.055 --> 00:30:10.225
But your status as a Nazi killer
is still amateur.

344
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.313
We all come here to see
if you want to go pro.

345
00:30:21.153 --> 00:30:23.488
Can I assume you know who we are?

346
00:30:23.572 --> 00:30:24.865
You're Aldo the Apache.

347
00:30:27.326 --> 00:30:28.744
Werner, if you heard of us,

348
00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:31.496
you probably heard we ain't
in the prisoner-taking business.

349
00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.500
We in the killing Nazi business,
and, cousin, business is a-booming.

350
00:30:35.584 --> 00:30:36.835
HIRSCHBERG:
Oh, yeah.

351
00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:40.005
Now, that leaves two ways
we can play this out.

352
00:30:40.088 --> 00:30:42.257
Either kill you or let you go.

353
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:44.926
Whether or not you're going
to leave this ditch alive

354
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.928
depends entirely on you.

355
00:30:51.266 --> 00:30:54.019
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.

356
00:30:54.436 --> 00:30:58.857
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut
patrol fucking around here somewhere.

357
00:30:59.733 --> 00:31:01.860
If that patrol were to have any crack shots,

358
00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:04.905
that orchard would be
a goddamn sniper's delight.

359
00:31:06.114 --> 00:31:09.451
So if you ever want to eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again,

360
00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:14.373
you got to show me on
this here map where they are.

361
00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:18.627
You got to tell me how many they are,
and you got to tell me

362
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.129
what kind of artillery
they're carrying with them.

363
00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:26.802
You can't expect me to divulge information
that would put German lives in danger.

364
00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:31.890
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're
wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.

365
00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:34.851
I need to know about
Germans hiding in trees.

366
00:31:34.935 --> 00:31:38.105
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.

367
00:31:39.356 --> 00:31:40.857
Now, just take that finger of yours

368
00:31:40.941 --> 00:31:44.236
and point out on this here map
where this party is being held,

369
00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:47.697
how many is coming
and what they brought to play with.

370
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:57.082
I respectfully refuse, sir.

371
00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:00.752
Hear that?

372
00:32:02.045 --> 00:32:03.130
Yes.

373
00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:08.552
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.

374
00:32:08.885 --> 00:32:11.555
You might know him better by his nickname.

375
00:32:11.638 --> 00:32:13.390
The Bear Jew.

376
00:32:14.474 --> 00:32:18.520
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache,
you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.

377
00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:21.523
-I heard of The Bear Jew.
-What did you hear?

378
00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:25.068
Beats German soldiers with a club.

379
00:32:25.485 --> 00:32:29.239
He bashes their brains in
with a baseball bat, what he does.

380
00:32:29.573 --> 00:32:31.658
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you
one last goddamn time,

381
00:32:31.741 --> 00:32:35.745
and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.

382
00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:37.747
He's going to take that big bat of his,

383
00:32:37.831 --> 00:32:40.959
and he's going to
beat your ass to death with it.

384
00:32:44.254 --> 00:32:46.089
Now, take your
Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger,

385
00:32:46.173 --> 00:32:49.176
and point out on this map
what I want to know.

386
00:32:57.267 --> 00:32:58.560
Fuck you.

387
00:32:59.019 --> 00:33:00.645
And your Jew dogs.

388
00:33:04.608 --> 00:33:06.610
Actually, Werner,
we're all tickled to hear you say that.

389
00:33:06.693 --> 00:33:08.570
Quite frankly, watching Donny
beat Nazis to death

390
00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:11.531
is the closest we ever get
to going to the movies. Donny!

391
00:33:11.615 --> 00:33:12.741
DONNY: Yeah?

392
00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:15.327
Got us a German here
who wants to die for country.

393
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:16.786
Oblige him.

394
00:34:23.353 --> 00:34:25.814
Did you get that for killing Jews?

395
00:34:26.022 --> 00:34:27.274
Bravery.

396
00:34:43.873 --> 00:34:44.958
Yeah!

397
00:34:47.586 --> 00:34:48.670
BASTERD 1: Oh, no!

398
00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:49.963
BASTERD 2: Oh, no!

399
00:34:50.046 --> 00:34:51.214
Donny!

400
00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:52.924
BASTERD: Yeah, Donny!

401
00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:55.927
About now I'd be shitting
my pants if I was you.

402
00:34:57.429 --> 00:35:00.098
Teddy Fucking Williams
knocks it out of the park!

403
00:35:00.181 --> 00:35:03.810
Fenway Park is on its feet
for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!

404
00:35:03.893 --> 00:35:07.814
He went yard on that one,
on to fucking Lansdowne Street!

405
00:35:07.897 --> 00:35:08.940
You!

406
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.903
Damn it, Hirschberg!

407
00:35:13.987 --> 00:35:16.906
Donny, bring that other one over here. Alive!

408
00:35:17.157 --> 00:35:20.076
Get the fuck up! Batter up. You're on deck!

409
00:35:20.368 --> 00:35:23.079
Two hits. I hit you, you hit the ground.

410
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.165
English?

411
00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:27.584
ALDO: Wicki.

412
00:35:31.212 --> 00:35:33.173
Ask him if he wants to live.

413
00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:37.761
Tell him to point out on this map
the German position.

414
00:35:42.641 --> 00:35:44.267
Ask him how many Germans.

415
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.355
Around about 12.

416
00:35:48.521 --> 00:35:49.939
What kind of artillery?

417
00:35:56.738 --> 00:35:57.947
How did you survive this ordeal?

418
00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:00.825
They let me go.

419
00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.244
Now, when you report what happened here,

420
00:36:03.328 --> 00:36:06.998
you can't tell them you told us
what you told us. They'll shoot you.

421
00:36:07.082 --> 00:36:10.960
They're going to want to know
why you so special, we let you live.

422
00:36:11.044 --> 00:36:14.756
So tell them, we let you live so you could
spread the word through the ranks

423
00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:17.258
what's going to happen
to every Nazi we find.

424
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:22.097
You are not to tell anybody anything.
Not one word of detail!

425
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.934
Your outfit was ambushed,
and you got away!

426
00:36:26.434 --> 00:36:27.769
Not one word more!

427
00:36:29.104 --> 00:36:30.188
Yes, my Führer.

428
00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:36.111
Did they mark you like they did
the other survivors?

429
00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:38.613
Yes, my Führer.

430
00:36:39.823 --> 00:36:43.118
Now that you've survived the war,
when you get home, what you going to do?

431
00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:48.707
I will hug my mother like
I've never hugged her before.

432
00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:51.459
WICKI: He's going to hug his mother.

433
00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:55.296
Well, ain't that nice?

434
00:36:55.547 --> 00:36:57.298
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.

435
00:37:00.635 --> 00:37:01.803
Not only shall I remove it,
but I intend to burn it.

436
00:37:02.345 --> 00:37:04.222
WICKI: He's going to burn it.

437
00:37:04.514 --> 00:37:07.225
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.

438
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:12.230
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.

439
00:37:12.313 --> 00:37:13.815
Just like that.

440
00:37:18.486 --> 00:37:22.699
But you take off that uniform,
ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.

441
00:37:22.824 --> 00:37:24.993
And that don't sit well with us.

442
00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:33.668
So I'm going to give you
a little something you can't take off.

443
00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:49.517
You know, Lieutenant,
you're getting pretty good at that.

444
00:37:50.018 --> 00:37:53.188
You know how you
get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?

445
00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:55.356
Practice.

446
00:37:57.358 --> 00:37:59.360
Chapter Three

447
00:37:59.444 --> 00:38:03.239
GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS

448
00:38:04.199 --> 00:38:06.451
1944

449
00:38:07.202 --> 00:38:09.537
JUNE

450
00:39:04.217 --> 00:39:05.426
What starts tomorrow?

451
00:39:07.595 --> 00:39:09.222
A Max Linder festival.

452
00:39:11.224 --> 00:39:12.934
I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.

453
00:39:14.435 --> 00:39:17.063
Except Linder never made a film
as good as "The Kid."

454
00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:20.108
The chase climax of "The Kid," superb.

455
00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:28.449
I adore your cinema very much.

456
00:39:30.326 --> 00:39:31.452
Merci.

457
00:39:31.786 --> 00:39:32.787
Is it yours?

458
00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:35.623
Do I own it?

459
00:39:37.292 --> 00:39:38.418
Oui.

460
00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:43.464
How is it a girl as young as you
owns a cinema?

461
00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:45.425
My aunt left it to me.

462
00:39:46.634 --> 00:39:48.511
Merci for hosting a German night.

463
00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:50.972
I don't have a choice...

464
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:52.640
...but you're welcome.

465
00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.602
I love the Riefenstahl mountain films...

466
00:39:55.977 --> 00:39:56.978
...especially Piz Palu.

467
00:39:58.313 --> 00:40:00.648
It's nice to see a French girl
who's an admirer of Riefenstahl.

468
00:40:01.274 --> 00:40:03.151
"Admire" would not really be
the word I would use...

469
00:40:03.443 --> 00:40:06.112
...to describe my feelings towards
Fraulein Riefenstahl.

470
00:40:08.323 --> 00:40:10.325
But you do admire the director Pabst,
don't you?

471
00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:13.661
That's why you include his name
on the marquee...

472
00:40:14.954 --> 00:40:16.039
...when you didn't have to.

473
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.217
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.

474
00:40:29.052 --> 00:40:30.219
Even Germans.

475
00:40:30.511 --> 00:40:31.679
Even Germans, oui.

476
00:40:33.014 --> 00:40:34.682
Merci for your assistance, soldier.
Adieu.

477
00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:37.894
You're not finished.

478
00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:39.687
I'll finish in the morning.

479
00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:41.189
May I ask your name?

480
00:40:44.025 --> 00:40:45.026
You wish to see my papers?

481
00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:01.209
Emmanuelle Mimieux.

482
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.003
That's a very pretty name.

483
00:41:05.213 --> 00:41:06.214
Merci.

484
00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:07.590
Are you finished with my papers?

485
00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:13.638
Mademoiselle, may I introduce myself...

486
00:41:14.555 --> 00:41:15.807
...Fredrick Zoller.

487
00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:24.357
Well...

488
00:41:25.692 --> 00:41:29.570
...it's been a pleasure chatting
with a fellow cinema lover.

489
00:41:30.989 --> 00:41:32.031
Sweet dreams, mademoiselle.

490
00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:33.908
Adieu.

491
00:42:15.616 --> 00:42:16.701
Hello, mademoiselle.

492
00:42:17.076 --> 00:42:18.119
May I join you?

493
00:42:19.412 --> 00:42:20.455
Look, Fredrick...

494
00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:22.957
You remember my name?

495
00:42:23.291 --> 00:42:24.292
Yes.

496
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.129
Look, you seem a
pleasant enough fellow...

497
00:42:28.254 --> 00:42:29.297
Thank you.

498
00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:30.590
You're welcome.

499
00:42:31.132 --> 00:42:32.717
Regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.

500
00:42:36.262 --> 00:42:37.972
I apologize, mademoiselle...

501
00:42:38.639 --> 00:42:39.891
...I wasn't trying to be a pest.

502
00:42:40.975 --> 00:42:42.477
I was simply trying to be friendly.

503
00:42:43.603 --> 00:42:44.729
I don't wish to be your friend.

504
00:42:46.272 --> 00:42:47.315
Why not?

505
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.818
Don't act like an infant. You know why.

506
00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:54.989
I'm more than just a uniform.

507
00:42:55.448 --> 00:42:56.491
Not to me.

508
00:42:57.158 --> 00:42:59.285
If you are so desperate
for a French girlfriend...

509
00:43:00.078 --> 00:43:01.454
...I suggest you try Vichy.

510
00:43:34.195 --> 00:43:35.279
Who are you?

511
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.989
I thought I was just a uniform.

512
00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:39.283
You're not just a German soldier.

513
00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:41.953
Are you somebody's son?

514
00:43:42.787 --> 00:43:44.872
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.

515
00:44:18.156 --> 00:44:20.491
You're a very lucky girl,
catching a brave war hero.

516
00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:23.411
--No, no, no, no, the
mademoiselle is not my girlfriend.

517
00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:27.081
Can you write "Amour Babette"?

518
00:44:48.769 --> 00:44:49.979
So you're a war hero.

519
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.523
What did you do?

520
00:44:57.737 --> 00:44:59.488
I was alone in a bell tower
in a walled off city.

521
00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:02.950
It was myself and a thousand
rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest...

522
00:45:04.243 --> 00:45:06.120
...against three hundred enemy soldiers.

523
00:45:07.663 --> 00:45:08.789
What's a bird's nest?

524
00:45:11.584 --> 00:45:14.670
A bird's nest is what a sniper
would call a bell tower.

525
00:45:15.129 --> 00:45:18.090
It's a high structure, offering
a three hundred and sixty degree view.

526
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.052
Very advantageous for marksmen.

527
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:24.472
How many did you kill?

528
00:45:26.182 --> 00:45:27.266
Sixty-eight.

529
00:45:29.518 --> 00:45:30.603
The first day.

530
00:45:32.939 --> 00:45:34.148
A hundred and fifty...

531
00:45:36.108 --> 00:45:37.151
...the second day.

532
00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:41.489
Thirty-two the third day.

533
00:45:44.075 --> 00:45:45.910
On the fourth day they exited the city.

534
00:45:48.204 --> 00:45:51.582
Naturally, my war story received a
lot of attention in Germany...

535
00:45:51.958 --> 00:45:53.501
...that's why they all recognize me.

536
00:45:54.877 --> 00:45:57.213
They call me the German Sergeant York.

537
00:45:58.506 --> 00:46:00.132
Maybe they'll make a film
about your exploits.

538
00:46:02.635 --> 00:46:05.221
Well, that's just what
Joseph Goebbels thought.

539
00:46:06.055 --> 00:46:08.516
So he did and called it "Nation's Pride."

540
00:46:09.892 --> 00:46:14.272
And they wanted me to play myseIf...

541
00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:16.649
...so I did.

542
00:46:17.233 --> 00:46:19.652
Joseph thinks this movie will
be proven to be his masterpiece.

543
00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:21.988
And I will be the German Van Johnson.

544
00:46:22.863 --> 00:46:24.323
"Nation's Pride" is about you?

545
00:46:26.492 --> 00:46:28.536
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?

546
00:46:28.744 --> 00:46:29.787
I know.

547
00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:31.080
Comical?

548
00:46:31.914 --> 00:46:35.251
Well, good luck with your movie, Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.

549
00:46:46.304 --> 00:46:47.346
Good bye!

550
00:46:49.181 --> 00:46:50.641
-Do you need help?
-No, it's okay.

551
00:46:51.267 --> 00:46:52.435
If you need me, I'll be in the
storage room.

552
00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:53.602
Okay, my love.

553
00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:28.512
Mademoiselle Mimieux?

554
00:47:30.806 --> 00:47:31.849
Yes?

555
00:47:36.771 --> 00:47:37.897
Is this your cinema?

556
00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.023
Yes.

557
00:47:43.319 --> 00:47:44.362
Come down!

558
00:47:47.073 --> 00:47:48.115
Please.

559
00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:05.841
I don't understand. What have I done?

560
00:48:07.093 --> 00:48:08.219
She wants to know what she's done.

561
00:48:08.302 --> 00:48:09.720
Get your ass in that car.

562
00:48:30.116 --> 00:48:34.870
It's only the offspring of slaves that allows
America to be competitive athletically.

563
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:40.126
American Olympic gold can be
measured in Negro sweat.

564
00:48:55.683 --> 00:48:56.892
Good, you came.

565
00:48:56.976 --> 00:48:59.103
I wasn't sure whether or not
you'd accept my invitation.

566
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:01.021
Invitation?

567
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:03.315
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?

568
00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:04.442
Yes, it is, Dr. Goebbels.

569
00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:07.153
Emmanuelle, there is somebody
I want you to meet.

570
00:49:09.572 --> 00:49:13.701
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce
you to the minister of propaganda...

571
00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:17.079
...the leader of
the entire German film industry...

572
00:49:17.538 --> 00:49:21.375
...and now that I'm an actor, my boss,
Dr. Joseph Goebbels.

573
00:49:23.002 --> 00:49:24.253
Your reputation precedes you,
Fraulein Mimieux.

574
00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:34.054
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels'
French interpreter...

575
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:35.639
...Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.

576
00:49:36.015 --> 00:49:37.099
Hello.

577
00:49:42.938 --> 00:49:43.981
Hello.

578
00:49:45.733 --> 00:49:47.693
And you've met the Major.

579
00:49:49.153 --> 00:49:51.614
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo.

580
00:49:52.072 --> 00:49:53.282
At your service, mademoiselle.

581
00:49:54.283 --> 00:49:55.326
Please allow me...

582
00:49:56.619 --> 00:49:57.661
...have a seat, please.

583
00:50:04.168 --> 00:50:06.754
Try the champagne, mademoiselle,
it's quite good.

584
00:50:15.721 --> 00:50:17.932
I must say, Fraulein,
I should be rather annoyed with you.

585
00:50:20.476 --> 00:50:21.936
I arrive in France...

586
00:50:22.019 --> 00:50:24.021
...and I wish to have lunch with my star.

587
00:50:26.106 --> 00:50:27.149
Little do I know...

588
00:50:27.775 --> 00:50:30.110
...he's become the toast of Paris.

589
00:50:30.402 --> 00:50:32.321
And now he must find time for me.

590
00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:41.789
People wait in line hours, days to see me.

591
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:44.959
For the Führer...

592
00:50:46.085 --> 00:50:48.295
...and Private Zoller, I wait.

593
00:50:49.463 --> 00:50:53.050
So finally, I'm granted an audience
with the young Private.

594
00:50:56.387 --> 00:50:59.807
And he spends the entire lunch speaking
of you and your cinema.

595
00:51:00.641 --> 00:51:01.934
So Fraulein Mimieux,
let's get down to business.

596
00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:04.186
--Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels...

597
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:05.396
I haven't informed her yet.

598
00:51:05.479 --> 00:51:07.856
Unless the girl's a simpleton,
I'm sure she's figured it out by now.

599
00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:09.650
After all, she does operate a cinema.

600
00:51:10.859 --> 00:51:11.902
Francesca, tell her.

601
00:51:13.153 --> 00:51:15.281
What they are trying to tell you,
Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller...

602
00:51:15.364 --> 00:51:17.908
...has spent the last hour at lunch trying
to convince Monsieur Goebbels...

603
00:51:17.992 --> 00:51:20.494
...to abandon previous plans for
Private Zoller's film premiere...

604
00:51:20.995 --> 00:51:23.539
...and change the venue to your cinema.

605
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:25.833
What?

606
00:51:27.084 --> 00:51:28.127
I wanted to inform her.

607
00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:30.337
Shit! I apologize, Private, of course you did.

608
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:32.673
--What's the issue?

609
00:51:33.007 --> 00:51:35.843
The Private wanted to inform
the mademoiselle himself.

610
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:37.344
Nonsense!

611
00:51:38.345 --> 00:51:40.681
Until I ask my questions,
he has nothing to inform.

612
00:51:41.473 --> 00:51:44.810
Let the record state, I have not agreed
to switch cinemas for my premiere.

613
00:51:45.644 --> 00:51:46.812
Duly noted.

614
00:51:51.817 --> 00:51:53.402
You have opera boxes?

615
00:51:54.987 --> 00:51:56.030
Yes.

616
00:51:57.031 --> 00:51:58.115
How many?

617
00:51:59.867 --> 00:52:00.951
Two.

618
00:52:02.494 --> 00:52:04.121
More would be better.

619
00:52:05.414 --> 00:52:06.999
How many seats in your auditorium?

620
00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:08.709
Three hundred and fifty.

621
00:52:12.421 --> 00:52:15.716
That's almost four hundred less
than The Ritz.

622
00:52:16.008 --> 00:52:17.384
--But Dr. Goebbels...

623
00:52:17.885 --> 00:52:19.011
...that's not such a terrible thing.

624
00:52:19.762 --> 00:52:22.640
You said yourself you didn't want to
indulge every two-faced French bourgeois...

625
00:52:22.723 --> 00:52:23.766
...taking up space, currying favor.

626
00:52:24.391 --> 00:52:26.977
With less seats, it makes the
event more exclusive.

627
00:52:27.853 --> 00:52:30.856
You're not trying to fill the house,
they're fighting for seats.

628
00:52:31.732 --> 00:52:33.192
Besides, to hell with the French.

629
00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:37.071
This is a German night, a German event,
a German celebration.

630
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:40.157
This night is for you, me...

631
00:52:40.741 --> 00:52:42.660
...for the German military,
the high command...

632
00:52:42.743 --> 00:52:43.786
...their family and friends.

633
00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:46.163
The only people who should
be allowed in the room...

634
00:52:46.246 --> 00:52:48.624
...are people who will be moved by
the exploits on the screen.

635
00:52:58.092 --> 00:53:00.135
I see your public speaking has improved.

636
00:53:01.553 --> 00:53:03.639
It appears I've created a monster.

637
00:53:06.809 --> 00:53:09.103
A strangely persuasive monster.

638
00:53:15.275 --> 00:53:18.028
When the war is over, politics await.

639
00:53:26.453 --> 00:53:27.830
Well, Private...

640
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:33.711
...though it is true,
I'm inclined to indulge you anything...

641
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:38.549
I must watch a film in this young lady's
cinema before I can say, yes or no.

642
00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:44.638
So young lady, you are to close your
cinema for a private screening tonight.

643
00:53:49.977 --> 00:53:52.855
What German films do you have?

644
00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:54.857
Ah, Landa, you are here.

645
00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:00.696
Emmanuelle, this is Colonel Hans Landa
of the SS.

646
00:54:00.821 --> 00:54:03.282
He'll be running the security
for the premiere.

647
00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:10.914
Charmed, mademoiselle.

648
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.299
HANS: Au revoir, Shosanna!

649
00:54:21.842 --> 00:54:24.928
And now I must get the Reich Minister
to his next appointment.

650
00:54:26.054 --> 00:54:27.514
Slave driver.

651
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.226
French slave driver.

652
00:54:34.897 --> 00:54:37.149
Actually, in my role as security chief

653
00:54:37.232 --> 00:54:38.859
of this joyous German occasion,
I'm afraid I must...

654
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:41.487
...have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.

655
00:54:43.405 --> 00:54:44.490
What sort of discussion?

656
00:54:46.742 --> 00:54:51.747
That sounded suspiciously like a Private
questioning the order of a Colonel.

657
00:54:52.039 --> 00:54:53.415
Or am I just being sensitive?

658
00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:55.834
Nothing could be further
from the truth, Colonel.

659
00:54:55.918 --> 00:54:57.211
Your authority is beyond question.

660
00:54:58.545 --> 00:54:59.922
But your reputation does precede you.

661
00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:02.216
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
or myself be concerned?

662
00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:04.760
Hans, the boy means no harm...

663
00:55:05.427 --> 00:55:06.929
...he's simply smitten.

664
00:55:07.805 --> 00:55:10.224
And he's correct. Your reputation
does precede you.

665
00:55:11.892 --> 00:55:14.394
No need for concern, you two. As security
chief, I simply need to have a chat...

666
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.731
...with the possible new venue's
property owner.

667
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:31.745
Have you tried the strudel here?

668
00:55:34.456 --> 00:55:35.541
No, no.

669
00:55:35.958 --> 00:55:37.042
It's not so terrible.

670
00:55:38.961 --> 00:55:43.507
So how is it the young Private and
yourself came to be acquainted?

671
00:55:46.635 --> 00:55:49.596
Yes, two strudels. One for myself and
one for the mademoiselle.

672
00:55:50.639 --> 00:55:54.768
For me a cup of espresso
and for the mademoiselle...

673
00:55:55.102 --> 00:55:56.270
...a glass of milk.

674
00:55:59.606 --> 00:56:02.442
So, mademoiselle, you were
beginning to explain...?

675
00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:09.116
Up until a couple of days ago, I had no
knowledge of Private Zoller...

676
00:56:09.783 --> 00:56:10.826
...or his exploits.

677
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:12.953
To me...

678
00:56:13.787 --> 00:56:17.457
...the Private was simply just a patron
of my cinema. We spoke a few times but--

679
00:56:18.125 --> 00:56:20.627
--Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.

680
00:56:21.461 --> 00:56:24.214
This is a simple formality.

681
00:56:24.464 --> 00:56:26.967
No reason for you to feel anxious.

682
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:34.641
I apologize, I forgot to order the cream.

683
00:56:35.183 --> 00:56:36.310
--One moment.

684
00:56:43.108 --> 00:56:44.860
Wait for the cream.

685
00:56:57.205 --> 00:57:00.626
So, Emmanuelle.
May I call you Emmanuelle?

686
00:57:01.752 --> 00:57:02.794
Oui.

687
00:57:05.923 --> 00:57:07.174
So, Emmanuelle...

688
00:57:08.467 --> 00:57:09.551
...explain to me...

689
00:57:10.135 --> 00:57:13.639
...how does it happen, that a young lady
such as yourself, comes to own a cinema?

690
00:57:26.151 --> 00:57:27.194
After you.

691
00:57:43.543 --> 00:57:44.670
Verdict?

692
00:57:45.837 --> 00:57:47.714
Like I said, not so terrible.

693
00:57:55.847 --> 00:57:58.684
You were explaining the origin
of your cinema ownership.

694
00:57:59.726 --> 00:58:03.855
The cinema originally belonged
to my aunt and uncle.

695
00:58:05.732 --> 00:58:07.025
What are their names?

696
00:58:07.442 --> 00:58:08.652
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.

697
00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:10.862
Where are they now?

698
00:58:11.822 --> 00:58:13.699
My uncle was killed during Blitzkrieg.

699
00:58:14.533 --> 00:58:15.575
Pity.

700
00:58:16.576 --> 00:58:17.661
Continue.

701
00:58:18.078 --> 00:58:21.415
Aunt Ada passed away
from fever last spring.

702
00:58:21.915 --> 00:58:23.000
Regrettable.

703
00:58:24.209 --> 00:58:27.462
It's come to my attention you have a
Negro in your employ. Is that true?

704
00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:30.549
Oui.

705
00:58:32.426 --> 00:58:33.510
He is a Frenchman.

706
00:58:34.928 --> 00:58:36.054
His name is Marcel.

707
00:58:37.764 --> 00:58:41.351
He worked with my aunt and uncle
since they opened the cinema.

708
00:58:42.602 --> 00:58:44.563
He's the only other one who works with me.

709
00:58:44.855 --> 00:58:45.897
Doing what?

710
00:58:46.148 --> 00:58:47.232
Projectionist.

711
00:58:47.941 --> 00:58:49.026
Is he any good?

712
00:58:49.234 --> 00:58:50.318
The best.

713
00:58:51.778 --> 00:58:55.449
Actually, one could see where that
might be a good trade for them.

714
00:59:02.247 --> 00:59:04.708
Can you operate the projectors?

715
00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:06.418
Of course I can.

716
00:59:09.755 --> 00:59:11.798
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do...

717
00:59:12.883 --> 00:59:14.509
I'm quite positive...

718
00:59:15.469 --> 00:59:19.056
...he wouldn't want the success
or failure of his illustrious evening...

719
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.268
...dependent on the prowess of a Negro.

720
00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:25.979
So...

721
00:59:26.313 --> 00:59:27.564
...if it comes to pass...

722
00:59:28.273 --> 00:59:31.318
...we hold this event at your venue...

723
00:59:32.486 --> 00:59:35.405
...talented no doubt,
as your Negro may be...

724
00:59:36.782 --> 00:59:37.866
...you will...

725
00:59:38.909 --> 00:59:40.368
...operate the projectors.

726
00:59:45.373 --> 00:59:46.583
Is that acceptable?

727
00:59:47.209 --> 00:59:48.251
Oui.

728
00:59:49.795 --> 00:59:50.837
Cigarette?

729
00:59:53.548 --> 00:59:54.674
They are not French.

730
00:59:55.967 --> 00:59:57.052
They are German.

731
01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.280
I did have something else
I wanted to ask you.

732
01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:32.379
But right now, for the life of me,
I can't remember what it is.

733
01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:35.715
Oh, well, must not have been important.

734
01:00:39.678 --> 01:00:40.762
'Til tonight.

735
01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:53.817
I must say, I appreciate the modesty
of this cinema.

736
01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:57.612
Your cinema has real respect, almost
church like.

737
01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:01.408
Not to say we couldn't spruce the
place up a bit.

738
01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:04.119
Maybe I'll go to the Louvre,
pick up a few Greek nudes,

739
01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:05.912
and scatter them about the lobby.

740
01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:10.083
So, Emmanuelle, how did
you like "Lucky Kids"?

741
01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:13.587
I quite like Lilian Harvey.

742
01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:15.964
Lilian Harvey!

743
01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:18.300
Never mention that name again
in my presence!

744
01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:42.866
Hey...

745
01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:44.784
...what the fuck are we supposed to do?

746
01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.289
It looks like we're supposed
to have a Nazi premiere.

747
01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:52.959
Like I said,
what the fuck are we supposed to do?

748
01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:58.465
Well, I need to talk with you about that.

749
01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:02.636
I'm confused, what are we talking about?

750
01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:06.973
Filling the cinema with Nazis
and burning it down to the ground.

751
01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:08.308
I'm not talking about that.

752
01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:09.809
You are talking about that.

753
01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.978
No, we're talking about that, right now.

754
01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:16.483
If we can keep this place from burning
down by ourselves...

755
01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.818
...we can burn it down by ourselves?

756
01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.031
Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.

757
01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:26.034
And with Madame Mimieux's
350 nitrate film print collection...

758
01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:29.329
...we wouldn't even need explosives...

759
01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:31.331
...would we?

760
01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.501
You mean we wouldn't need
any more explosives?

761
01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:39.172
MALE NARRA TOR: At that time,
35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable

762
01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:42.342
that you couldn't even
bring a reel onto a streetcar.

763
01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.219
Hey, you can't bring those here
on a public vehicle.

764
01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:45.720
-They're films, ain't they?
-Yes.

765
01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:47.514
Then they're flammable. Go on, hop off.

766
01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:51.518
MALE NARRATOR: Because nitrate film
burns three times faster than paper.

767
01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:57.190
Shosanna has a collection

768
01:02:57.232 --> 01:03:02.279
of over 350 nitrate film prints.

769
01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:06.366
I am going to burn down the cinema
on Nazi night.

770
01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:13.456
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema...

771
01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:14.916
...which I am...

772
01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:19.212
...we both know, you're not
going to let me do it by myself.

773
01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:25.385
Because you love me. And I love you.

774
01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.887
And you're the only person on this earth
I can trust.

775
01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.559
But that's not all we're going to do.

776
01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:37.063
Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic
still work?

777
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.983
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?

778
01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:41.401
Quite well, actually.

779
01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:46.072
I recorded a new guitarist I met
in a cafe last week. It works superb.

780
01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:50.243
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?

781
01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:58.126
Because Marcel, my sweet...

782
01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.086
...we're going to make a film.

783
01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:03.840
Just for the Nazis.

784
01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:07.427
Chapter Four

785
01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:09.763
OPERATION KINO

786
01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.977
MAN: Right this way, Lieutenant.

787
01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:38.875
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.

788
01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:41.795
General Ed Fenech. At ease, Hicox.

789
01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:43.797
Drink?

790
01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:49.803
If you offer me a scotch and plain water,
I could drink a scotch and plain water.

791
01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:53.473
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?

792
01:04:53.515 --> 01:04:55.475
The bar is in the globe.

793
01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:01.981
Something for yourself, sir?

794
01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:05.193
Whiskey. Straight. No junk in it.

795
01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:09.406
It says here that you speak German fluently.

796
01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:11.491
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

797
01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:15.412
-And your occupation before the war?
-I'm a film critic.

798
01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:19.999
-List your accomplishments.
-Well, sir, such as they are,

799
01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:24.587
I write reviews and articles for
a publication called Films and Filmmakers,

800
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:27.090
and I've had two books published.

801
01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:31.010
Impressive. Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?

802
01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:32.178
The first book was called

803
01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:36.683
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.

804
01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:40.603
And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.

805
01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:46.025
It's a sub textual film criticism study
of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.

806
01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:49.446
-What should we drink to, sir?
-Well...

807
01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:54.075
-Down with Hitler.
-All the way down, sir.

808
01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:55.618
Yes.

809
01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:03.543
Are you familiar with German cinema
under the Third Reich?

810
01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:09.632
Yes. Obviously, I haven't seen any
of the films made in the last three years,

811
01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:13.052
-but I'm familiar with it.
-Explain it to me.

812
01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.804
Pardon, sir?

813
01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:19.142
Well, this little escapade of ours requires
a knowledge of the German film industry

814
01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:24.397
under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.

815
01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:28.943
Goebbels considers the films he's making

816
01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:32.238
to be the beginning of a new era
in German cinema.

817
01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:34.407
An alternative to what he considers

818
01:06:34.449 --> 01:06:37.410
the Jewish-German intellectual cinema
of the '20s,

819
01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:40.830
and the Jewish-controlled dogma
of Hollywood.

820
01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:42.457
How's he doing?

821
01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:45.585
Frightfully sorry, sir. Once again?

822
01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:50.632
You say he wants to take on the Jews
at their own game.

823
01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:54.636
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,

824
01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:59.098
-how's he doing?
-Quite well, actually.

825
01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:01.351
Since Goebbels has taken over,

826
01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:05.855
film attendance has steadily risen
in Germany over the last eight years.

827
01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:09.442
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be
Goebbels' proper opposite number.

828
01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:13.279
I believe Goebbels sees himself
closer to David O. Selznick.

829
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.118
Brief him.

830
01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:24.499
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time
I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.

831
01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:26.209
Three days from now

832
01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:30.630
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.

833
01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:34.634
-What film, sir?
-The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.

834
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:38.972
In attendance
at this joyous Germatic occasion

835
01:07:39.013 --> 01:07:43.476
will be Goebbels, Göring, Bormann,
and most of the German High Command

836
01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:47.313
including all high ranking officers
of both the SS and the Gestapo,

837
01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:50.817
as well as luminaries
of the Nazi propaganda film industry.

838
01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:52.986
The master race at play?

839
01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:57.198
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs
in one basket.

840
01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.826
The objective of Operation Kino,

841
01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:02.495
blow up the basket.

842
01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:07.375
And like the snows of yesteryear,
gone from this earth.

843
01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:09.919
Jolly good, sir.

844
01:08:10.712 --> 01:08:14.215
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines

845
01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:15.842
will be your assist.

846
01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:19.846
The Germans call them the Basterds.

847
01:08:20.346 --> 01:08:23.558
The Basterds. Never heard of them.

848
01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:26.561
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy,
you not hearing of them.

849
01:08:26.686 --> 01:08:30.690
But the Jerries have heard of them, because
these Yanks have been them the devil.

850
01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:35.445
You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.

851
01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.614
The Basterds will be waiting for you.

852
01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:41.034
First thing, you'll go to a little village
called Nadine.

853
01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:44.370
In Nadine,
there's a tavern called La Louisiane.

854
01:08:44.454 --> 01:08:47.624
There you'll rendezvous with
our double agent. She'll take it from there.

855
01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:49.876
She's the one who is going to get you
into the premiere.

856
01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:53.713
It'll be you, her, and two German-born
members of the Basterds.

857
01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:57.133
She's also made all the other arrangements
you're going to need.

858
01:08:57.967 --> 01:08:59.218
How will I know her?

859
01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:02.472
I suspect
that won't be too much trouble for you.

860
01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:08.061
-Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
-Bridget von Hammersmark?

861
01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:12.315
The German movie star
is working for England?

862
01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:14.984
Yes, for the last two years now.

863
01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:18.613
One could even say that Operation Kino
was her brainchild.

864
01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.990
Indeed.
-Got the gist?

865
01:09:21.074 --> 01:09:23.785
I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.

866
01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:27.914
The village of
Nadine

867
01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:31.459
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous
is in a fucking basement.

868
01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:34.420
-I didn't know.
-You said it was in a tavern.

869
01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:37.090
-It is a tavern.
-Yeah, in a basement.

870
01:09:37.757 --> 01:09:40.635
You know, fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.

871
01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.013
Number one being,
you're fighting in a basement.

872
01:09:44.097 --> 01:09:45.973
What if we go in there
and she's not even there?

873
01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:47.308
We wait.

874
01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:52.188
Don't worry. She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.

875
01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:17.171
-Stiglitz, right?
-That's right, sir.

876
01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:20.967
I hear you're pretty good with that.

877
01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:27.849
You know, we're not looking
for trouble right now.

878
01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:31.686
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.

879
01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:38.359
However, the off chance I'm wrong,
things prove eventful,

880
01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:42.530
I need to know we can all remain calm.

881
01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:48.661
I don't look calm to you?

882
01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:56.502
Well, now that you put it like that,
I guess you do.

883
01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:17.398
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz,
not exactly the loquacious type, is he?

884
01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:22.945
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?

885
01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:27.241
Fair point, Lieutenant.

886
01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:32.330
So you all get in trouble in there,
what are we supposed to do?

887
01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:34.582
Make bets on how it all comes out?

888
01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:38.961
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.

889
01:11:40.505 --> 01:11:43.424
But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure

890
01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:47.637
no Germans, or French, for that matter,
escape from that basement.

891
01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:52.809
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover
is compromised, the mission is kaput.

892
01:11:53.184 --> 01:11:58.856
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose
idea was it for the death-trap rendezvous?

893
01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:02.985
-She chose the spot.
-Isn't that just dandy?

894
01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:06.989
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.

895
01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:11.244
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to
know you don't want to fight in a basement.

896
01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.371
She wasn't picking a place to fight.

897
01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:16.249
She was picking a place isolated
and without Germans.

898
01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:19.001
Am I German?

899
01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:20.503
No.

900
01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:25.758
Ok, you count.
Am I from the past?

901
01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.260
Yes.

902
01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.388
Am I a woman?

903
01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:31.556
No.

904
01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:33.933
Mathilda.

905
01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:35.643
Schnapps? Schnapps?

906
01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:36.769
Schnapps...Schnapps...Schnapps.

907
01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:39.021
Five schnapps, please.

908
01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:42.483
Difficult. Really difficult.

909
01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:43.651
Come on. Five questions left.

910
01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:44.819
Yes, I am thinking.

911
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:47.905
Okay, I am... not German.

912
01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:49.907
Am I American?

913
01:12:49.991 --> 01:12:51.075
Yes you are!

914
01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:52.577
-Yeah?
-Well, not really.

915
01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.620
Of course he is.

916
01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:56.998
Well, if he's so American,

917
01:12:57.081 --> 01:12:58.666
how come he's never been translated
into English?

918
01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.085
He is not American.

919
01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:05.840
He's supposed to be American,
but he's not an American creation.

920
01:13:06.007 --> 01:13:07.425
In fact, he's something very different.

921
01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:09.343
--So, I'm male...

922
01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:12.138
...I'm a fictional, literary character
from the past...

923
01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:15.850
...I'm American, and that's controversial.

924
01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:18.686
No, it's not controversial at all.

925
01:13:18.769 --> 01:13:23.399
The nationality of the author has nothing
to do with the nationality of the character.

926
01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:26.652
The character is the character.

927
01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:29.572
Hamlet is not British. He is Danish.

928
01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:32.491
So yes, this character was born in America.

929
01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:33.993
Well then.

930
01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:39.498
Well, I'm glad that's settled.

931
01:13:43.044 --> 01:13:44.128
If I had a wife...

932
01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:46.088
...would she be called a squaw?

933
01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.298
Yes!

934
01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:48.424
He's got it.

935
01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:50.718
Three more questions!

936
01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:51.969
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?

937
01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:53.137
Yes!

938
01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.263
Did Karl May write me?

939
01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:55.431
Yes!

940
01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:56.599
So who are you?!

941
01:13:56.891 --> 01:13:59.435
I am "Winnetou," chief of the Apaches!

942
01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:00.978
Yes!

943
01:14:01.646 --> 01:14:03.105
That was good! That was good!
That was good!

944
01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:04.732
Now down with the glasses!

945
01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.192
Cheers.

946
01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:07.902
Cheers.

947
01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:17.078
Attention!

948
01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:24.710
Hello, my lovelies.

949
01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:26.337
Take a seat.

950
01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.925
I will join you in moments. I'm just saying
goodbye to my five new friends here.

951
01:14:31.926 --> 01:14:34.178
No hurry, Frau von Hammersmark.
Take your time.

952
01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:36.222
Enjoy yourself.
We'll be just over here waiting.

953
01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.941
Eric, my love.
Those are the friends I've been waiting for.

954
01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:48.734
Please treat them to anything they like.

955
01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:51.779
Frau von Hammersmark.
Your wish is my command.

956
01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:54.448
Officers...

957
01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.367
...it would appear
the drinks are on the fraulein.

958
01:14:57.451 --> 01:14:59.203
-What would you like?
-Whiskey.

959
01:14:59.286 --> 01:15:00.329
Two whiskeys.

960
01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:02.707
-Three whiskeys.
-Three whiskeys, very well.

961
01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:06.794
I wish you a wonderful evening.

962
01:15:06.877 --> 01:15:08.796
-Same to you.
-I thank you.

963
01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:10.715
Your card!

964
01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:12.133
Yes, you're right.

965
01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.468
Let's see.

966
01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:18.472
Genghis Khan!
I would never have gotten that.

967
01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:19.849
But of course you would have!

968
01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:21.142
Hello, darling.

969
01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:24.562
How are you?

970
01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:28.774
So good to see you.

971
01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:41.328
I thought this place was supposed to
have more French than Germans?

972
01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.540
Yes, normally that's true.

973
01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:48.002
The Sergeant over there's wife
just had a baby.

974
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:53.841
And his commanding officer gave him
and his mates the night off to celebrate.

975
01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:56.844
We should leave.

976
01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:58.554
No.

977
01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.222
We should stay.

978
01:16:00.514 --> 01:16:01.849
For one drink at least.

979
01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:03.893
I've been waiting for you in a bar.

980
01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:07.396
It would look strange if we left
before we had a drink.

981
01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.691
She's right.
Just be calm and enjoy your whiskey.

982
01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:12.943
Mmm.

983
01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:17.823
Mathilda...

984
01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:20.159
...come join us in the game.
Take Frau Hammersmark's place.

985
01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:31.087
She would love to play the game.

986
01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:35.716
I will translate...and protect.

987
01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:37.051
Don't worry, pretty little thing.

988
01:16:37.218 --> 01:16:41.555
If any of these wolves gets
out of line, I'll kick their ass in.

989
01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:42.807
Watch.

990
01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:46.268
Rip off his nose.

991
01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:54.985
Stop it!

992
01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:57.363
Schnapps, schnapps, take your
schnapps in hand, comrades.

993
01:16:58.197 --> 01:16:59.323
Before we go on playing...

994
01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:00.950
...we will drink.

995
01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:04.120
We drink to our friend Wilhelm.

996
01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:07.039
And his little boy...

997
01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.041
...Maximilian.

998
01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:11.794
-To Max!
-To Max!

999
01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:14.296
There's some new development.

1000
01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.881
The cinema venue has changed.

1001
01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:17.383
Why?

1002
01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:19.468
No one knows but that should
not be a real problem.

1003
01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:23.055
The cinema it's been changed to
is considerably smaller than The Ritz.

1004
01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:27.393
So whatever explosives you brought for
The Ritz should be doubly effective here.

1005
01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:32.398
Now the next piece of information...

1006
01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:33.983
...is colossal.

1007
01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:35.568
Try not to overreact.

1008
01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:38.988
The Führer-

1009
01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:43.242
...I was just thinking...

1010
01:17:43.742 --> 01:17:46.579
...could you sign an autograph
to my son on his birthday?

1011
01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:50.749
Of course. I'd love to, Wilhelm.

1012
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:55.254
This handsome Staff Sergeant
just became a father today.

1013
01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:56.714
Congratulations.

1014
01:17:58.257 --> 01:17:59.341
Thank you.

1015
01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.093
Do you know the name of this progeny yet?

1016
01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:06.932
I most certainly do,
fraulein. His name is Maximilian.

1017
01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:08.934
Maximilian, wonderful name.

1018
01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:12.688
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1019
01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:17.943
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.

1020
01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:28.078
Max may not know who you are now but...

1021
01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:31.457
...he will. I will show him all of your movies.

1022
01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:32.958
Good.

1023
01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:35.127
He will grow up with your films and...

1024
01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:39.632
...this napkin on his wall.

1025
01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:45.638
I propose a toast
to the greatest actress in Germany!

1026
01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:50.309
There is no Dietrich! There is no Riefenstahl!
Only Von Hammersmark!

1027
01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:52.978
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1028
01:18:53.646 --> 01:18:54.730
-Cheers!

1029
01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:01.153
Once again-

1030
01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:07.743
Frau Hammersmark,
what brings you to France?

1031
01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:10.996
None of your business!

1032
01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:13.165
Staff Sergeant.

1033
01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:18.796
You might not have worn out your welcome
with the fraulein

1034
01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:21.757
with your drunken boorish behavior...

1035
01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:23.842
...but you have worn out
your welcome with me.

1036
01:19:25.844 --> 01:19:29.640
Might I remind you, Staff Sergeant,
you are an enlisted man.

1037
01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:31.517
This is an officer's table!

1038
01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:37.481
I suggest you stop pestering the fraulein...

1039
01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:40.025
...and rejoin your table.

1040
01:19:45.823 --> 01:19:50.703
Excuse me, Captain,
but your accent is very unusual.

1041
01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:54.873
Where are you from?

1042
01:19:57.918 --> 01:20:01.171
You must be either completely
drunk or mad to dare...

1043
01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:03.716
...to speak to a superior officer with
such impertinentness!

1044
01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:05.384
Staff Sergeant.

1045
01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:08.554
I'm making you and you responsible for him.

1046
01:20:08.679 --> 01:20:09.930
I suggest you take hold of your friend...

1047
01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:13.892
...or he'll spend Max's first birthday
in jail for public drunkenness.

1048
01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:16.228
--Might I inquire?

1049
01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:49.762
Like our young
newly christened father here...

1050
01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:53.307
...I, too, have an acute ear for accents.

1051
01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:57.978
And like him...

1052
01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:00.564
...I, too, find yours odd.

1053
01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:04.109
From where do you hail, Captain?

1054
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:05.736
Major, this is highly-

1055
01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:07.988
---I wasn't speaking to you,
Lieutenant Munich.

1056
01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:11.950
Or you either, Lieutenant Frankfurt.

1057
01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:18.624
I was speaking to
Captain I-don't-know-what.

1058
01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:27.466
I was born in a village that rests
in the shadow of the Piz Palü.

1059
01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.635
-The mountain?
-Yes.

1060
01:21:30.636 --> 01:21:32.137
In that village, we all speak like this.

1061
01:21:33.806 --> 01:21:36.016
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

1062
01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:38.977
-Yes.
-Then you saw me.

1063
01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:43.649
You remember the skiing torch scene?

1064
01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:46.527
Yes.

1065
01:21:47.528 --> 01:21:53.158
In that scene was myself, my father,
my sister and my two brothers.

1066
01:21:54.701 --> 01:21:56.495
My brother is so handsome...

1067
01:21:56.995 --> 01:22:00.499
...the director Pabst, gave him a Close-Up.

1068
01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:04.837
Herr Major, if my word means anything...

1069
01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:09.341
...I can vouch for everything
the young captain has just said.

1070
01:22:10.843 --> 01:22:13.345
He does hail from the bottom
of the Piz Palü.

1071
01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:18.559
He was in the film and his brother
is far more handsome than he.

1072
01:22:29.027 --> 01:22:30.571
You should rejoin your friends.

1073
01:22:34.825 --> 01:22:35.868
May I join you?

1074
01:22:35.909 --> 01:22:37.035
By all means.

1075
01:22:38.162 --> 01:22:39.204
Wunderbar!

1076
01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:50.048
So that's the source of your bizarre accent.

1077
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:52.593
That's extraordinary.

1078
01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:54.386
What are you doing here?

1079
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.723
Aside from having a drink
with the lovely fraulein?

1080
01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:01.393
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.

1081
01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:03.645
I mean in country.

1082
01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:08.233
You're obviously not stationed in
France or I'd know who you are.

1083
01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:10.652
You know every German in France?

1084
01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:12.571
Worth knowing.

1085
01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:20.579
Well, there lies the problem.

1086
01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:22.831
We never claimed to be worth knowing.

1087
01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:25.918
All levity aside,
what are you doing in France?

1088
01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:30.589
Attending Minister Goebbels' film
premiere as the fraulein's escort.

1089
01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:35.344
You are the Fraulein Hammersmark's
escort.

1090
01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:39.348
Someone has to carry her lighter.

1091
01:23:45.145 --> 01:23:48.524
The captain is my date,
but all three are my guests.

1092
01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:50.776
We are old friends...

1093
01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:52.861
...who go back a long time.

1094
01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:58.784
Actually, longer than an actress
would care to admit.

1095
01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:03.288
Well, in that case...

1096
01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:06.792
...let me raise my glass to the
three luckiest men in the room.

1097
01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:08.835
I'll drink to that.

1098
01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:14.049
Queen Christina.

1099
01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:20.222
Mata Hari.

1100
01:24:25.018 --> 01:24:26.144
I must say...

1101
01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.814
...that game they're playing
looks like a good bit of fun.

1102
01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:31.817
I didn't join them
because you're quite right, Captain.

1103
01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:34.653
An officer should not fraternize
with enlisted men.

1104
01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:37.322
But...

1105
01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:39.533
...seeing as we are all officers...

1106
01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:42.828
...and sophisticated lady friends of officers.

1107
01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:44.371
What say we play the game?

1108
01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:46.999
Yes, great, one game.

1109
01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:48.333
Wunderbar.

1110
01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:51.837
Soldiers...

1111
01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:53.505
...the cards.

1112
01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:56.883
Thank you.

1113
01:24:58.885 --> 01:24:59.928
So gentlemen...

1114
01:25:01.388 --> 01:25:03.181
...the object of the game is to...

1115
01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:06.059
...write the name of a famous
person on your card.

1116
01:25:06.518 --> 01:25:08.353
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.

1117
01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:11.231
For instance, you could write,
Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.

1118
01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:12.691
Eric! More pens.

1119
01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:14.860
And they must be famous, not aunt Frida.

1120
01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:17.863
When you finish writing,
put the card face down on the table.

1121
01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:20.365
And move it to the person on your right-

1122
01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:21.617
--Thanks.

1123
01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.744
-the person to your left
moves his card to you.

1124
01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:26.204
You pick up the card without looking at it...

1125
01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:27.623
...lick the back...

1126
01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:31.460
...and stick it on your forehead.

1127
01:25:45.766 --> 01:25:46.850
Write!

1128
01:25:46.933 --> 01:25:47.976
Write.

1129
01:26:09.122 --> 01:26:10.957
I'll start, give you the idea.

1130
01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.003
Am I German?

1131
01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:16.380
-No.
-No.

1132
01:26:16.797 --> 01:26:17.839
Am I American?

1133
01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.049
-No.
-No.

1134
01:26:19.132 --> 01:26:20.384
Wait a minute, he goes to

1135
01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:24.179
Obviously, he wasn't born in America.

1136
01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:27.307
So...I visited America, aye?

1137
01:26:27.391 --> 01:26:28.475
Yes.

1138
01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:31.978
Was this visit fortuitous?

1139
01:26:32.813 --> 01:26:33.855
Not for you.

1140
01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:39.277
My native land,
is it what one would call, exotic?

1141
01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:41.571
-Yes.
-Yes.

1142
01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:49.204
That could be either a reference
to the jungle or the Orient.

1143
01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:53.667
I'm going to let my first instinct take over
and ask. Am I from the jungle?

1144
01:26:53.834 --> 01:26:54.876
-Yes.
-Yes.

1145
01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:58.422
Now gentlemen, around this time you could
ask whether you're real or fictitious.

1146
01:26:59.005 --> 01:27:01.508
I, however, think that's too easy,
so I won't ask that yet.

1147
01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:03.218
Okay...

1148
01:27:03.301 --> 01:27:05.554
...my native land is the jungle...

1149
01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.848
...I visited America...

1150
01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:10.559
...but my visit was not fortuitous to me...

1151
01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:14.938
...but the implication is
that it was to somebody else.

1152
01:27:20.193 --> 01:27:21.236
When I went...

1153
01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:24.781
...from the jungle to America...

1154
01:27:27.993 --> 01:27:29.035
...did I go by boat?

1155
01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:30.162
-Yes.
-Yes.

1156
01:27:32.038 --> 01:27:33.498
Did I go against my will?

1157
01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:34.624
-Yes.
-Yes.

1158
01:27:38.837 --> 01:27:40.464
On this boat ride, was I in chains?

1159
01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:41.798
Yes.

1160
01:27:42.215 --> 01:27:44.468
When I arrived in America,
was I displayed in chains?

1161
01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:45.594
-Yes.
-Yes.

1162
01:27:45.677 --> 01:27:46.845
Am I the story of the Negro in America?

1163
01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:49.139
-No.

1164
01:27:49.222 --> 01:27:50.307
Well then I must be King Kong.

1165
01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:54.019
Bravo!

1166
01:27:54.227 --> 01:27:55.604
Impressive.

1167
01:27:56.813 --> 01:27:59.858
Now, since I answered correctly, you
all need to finish your drinks.

1168
01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:01.735
Cheers.

1169
01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.325
Now, who is next?

1170
01:28:09.242 --> 01:28:10.285
Well, Major...

1171
01:28:11.912 --> 01:28:17.542
...I don't mean to be rude. But
the four of us are very good friends.

1172
01:28:18.585 --> 01:28:20.295
And we haven't seen each other
in quite a while.

1173
01:28:22.923 --> 01:28:24.049
So, Major...

1174
01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:25.759
...I am afraid...

1175
01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:28.094
...you are intruding.

1176
01:28:30.222 --> 01:28:32.224
I beg to differ, Captain.

1177
01:28:33.934 --> 01:28:38.897
It's only if the fraulein considers
my presence an intrusion...

1178
01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:41.399
...that I become an intruder.

1179
01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:48.573
How about it, Fraulein von Hammersmark?
Am I intruding?

1180
01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.034
I didn't think so.

1181
01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:56.373
It's simply the captain
is immune to my charms.

1182
01:29:11.429 --> 01:29:12.764
I am just joking.

1183
01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:17.435
Just joking. Of course I'm intruding.

1184
01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:21.773
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen,
and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu.

1185
01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:25.318
Eric has a bottle of
thirty-three-year-old whiskey.

1186
01:29:25.569 --> 01:29:26.611
From the Scottish Highlands.

1187
01:29:27.654 --> 01:29:28.780
What do you say, gentlemen?

1188
01:29:29.447 --> 01:29:31.575
You're most gracious, Major.

1189
01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.452
Eric! The thirty-three. And new glasses!

1190
01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:38.081
You don't want to contaminate the
thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.

1191
01:29:38.164 --> 01:29:39.249
How many glasses?

1192
01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:40.584
-Five.
-Not for me.

1193
01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:42.460
I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.

1194
01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:44.296
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.

1195
01:29:45.255 --> 01:29:46.298
Three glasses.

1196
01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:24.044
Frau von Hammersmark.

1197
01:30:25.295 --> 01:30:26.338
Thank you.

1198
01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:31.009
A thousand year German Reich!

1199
01:30:31.426 --> 01:30:32.928
-A thousand year Reich!
-A thousand year Reich!

1200
01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:44.856
I must say I grow weary
of these monkeyshines.

1201
01:30:48.318 --> 01:30:49.361
Did you hear that?

1202
01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:53.281
That was the sound of my Walther.

1203
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:55.742
Pointed right at your testicles.

1204
01:30:59.287 --> 01:31:01.748
Why do you have your Walther pointed
at my testicles?

1205
01:31:03.249 --> 01:31:06.086
Because you've just
given yourself away, Captain.

1206
01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:09.339
You're no more German than that scotch.

1207
01:31:19.432 --> 01:31:20.809
-Well, Major.
-Shut up slut.

1208
01:31:21.977 --> 01:31:23.019
You were saying?

1209
01:31:27.565 --> 01:31:31.069
I was saying that makes two of us.

1210
01:31:32.362 --> 01:31:35.490
I've had a gun pointed at your
balls since you sat down.

1211
01:31:37.867 --> 01:31:39.077
That makes three of us.

1212
01:31:39.452 --> 01:31:43.248
And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.

1213
01:31:45.125 --> 01:31:47.502
Looks like we have
a bit of a sticky situation here.

1214
01:31:48.461 --> 01:31:51.673
What's going to happen, Major...

1215
01:31:52.799 --> 01:31:55.468
...you're going to stand up
and walk out that door with us.

1216
01:31:56.052 --> 01:31:57.470
--No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't think so.

1217
01:31:58.263 --> 01:31:59.431
I'm afraid you and I...

1218
01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:01.766
...we both know, Captain...

1219
01:32:02.225 --> 01:32:05.478
...no matter what happens to anybody else
in this room...

1220
01:32:05.895 --> 01:32:08.440
...the two of us aren't going anywhere.

1221
01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:15.989
Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm
and his famous friends.

1222
01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:20.452
If any of you expect to live,
you'll have to shoot them too.

1223
01:32:21.953 --> 01:32:25.123
Looks like little Max will grow up an orphan.

1224
01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:27.792
How sad.

1225
01:32:34.132 --> 01:32:36.468
Well, if this is it, old boy,

1226
01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:40.013
I hope you don't mind if I go out
speaking the King's.

1227
01:32:41.139 --> 01:32:43.058
By all means, Captain.

1228
01:32:49.147 --> 01:32:52.734
There's a special rung in hell reserved
for people who waste good Scotch.

1229
01:32:54.152 --> 01:32:56.988
Seeing as I may be rapping
on the door momentarily,

1230
01:33:02.035 --> 01:33:05.663
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.

1231
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.836
Now, about this pickle

1232
01:33:13.379 --> 01:33:15.173
we find ourselves in.

1233
01:33:17.592 --> 01:33:20.678
It would appear there's only
one thing left for you to do.

1234
01:33:20.762 --> 01:33:22.680
And what would that be?

1235
01:33:23.348 --> 01:33:25.850
-Stiglitz.
-Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.

1236
01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:04.389
You outside. Who are you?

1237
01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:06.599
British? American?

1238
01:34:07.392 --> 01:34:08.476
What?

1239
01:34:09.269 --> 01:34:10.812
ALDO: We're American.

1240
01:34:11.104 --> 01:34:12.564
What are you?

1241
01:34:12.897 --> 01:34:14.899
I'm a German, you idiot.

1242
01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:17.902
ALDO: Speak English
pretty good for a German.

1243
01:34:17.986 --> 01:34:19.237
I agree.

1244
01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:21.990
So let's talk.

1245
01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.117
ALDO: Okay, talk.

1246
01:34:24.826 --> 01:34:26.286
I'm a father.

1247
01:34:27.579 --> 01:34:30.456
My baby was born today. In Frankfurt.

1248
01:34:30.957 --> 01:34:32.500
Five hours ago.

1249
01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:37.422
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.

1250
01:34:38.256 --> 01:34:41.676
They're the ones that came in shooting
and killing. It's not my fault!

1251
01:34:41.759 --> 01:34:43.845
ALDO: Okay! It wasn't your fault.

1252
01:34:45.263 --> 01:34:47.098
What's your name, soldier?

1253
01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:48.349
Wilhelm.

1254
01:34:49.267 --> 01:34:52.770
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?

1255
01:34:52.854 --> 01:34:54.606
-No.
-I'm alive!

1256
01:34:56.858 --> 01:34:58.276
ALDO: Who's that?

1257
01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:03.031
Is the girl on your side?

1258
01:35:04.616 --> 01:35:05.825
ALDO: Which girl?

1259
01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:08.328
Who do you think? Von Hammersmark.

1260
01:35:09.954 --> 01:35:11.039
ALDO: Yeah, she's ours.

1261
01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:13.625
ALDO: Is she okay?

1262
01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:17.629
ALDO: Wilhelm!

1263
01:35:18.963 --> 01:35:20.548
She's been shot.

1264
01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:23.134
But she's alive.

1265
01:35:27.055 --> 01:35:28.556
ALDO: Okay, Wilhelm.

1266
01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:31.976
What do you say we make us a deal?

1267
01:35:33.311 --> 01:35:34.729
What's your name?

1268
01:35:34.812 --> 01:35:35.855
Aldo.

1269
01:35:36.814 --> 01:35:38.983
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.

1270
01:35:39.317 --> 01:35:42.904
You let me and one of my men
come down there and take the girl away.

1271
01:35:42.987 --> 01:35:45.531
No guns. No guns me, no guns you.

1272
01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:49.160
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.

1273
01:35:49.494 --> 01:35:51.996
You go your way, we go ours.

1274
01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.999
And little Max gets to grow up
playing catch with his daddy.

1275
01:35:56.167 --> 01:35:59.003
So what do you say, Willi? We got us a deal?

1276
01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:04.509
Aldo.

1277
01:36:05.843 --> 01:36:07.387
ALDO: I'm here, Willi.

1278
01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:10.848
I want to trust you.

1279
01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:12.016
But...

1280
01:36:13.017 --> 01:36:14.519
But how can I?

1281
01:36:16.688 --> 01:36:18.690
ALDO: What choice you got, son?

1282
01:36:24.529 --> 01:36:26.572
Okay, okay.

1283
01:36:28.199 --> 01:36:29.367
Aldo,

1284
01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:32.078
I'm going to trust you.

1285
01:36:32.912 --> 01:36:34.038
Come down.

1286
01:36:49.929 --> 01:36:52.932
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?

1287
01:36:53.057 --> 01:36:55.268
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.

1288
01:36:55.393 --> 01:36:56.894
Not so fast.

1289
01:36:56.978 --> 01:36:59.564
We only got a deal, we trust each other.

1290
01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:01.399
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.

1291
01:37:01.774 --> 01:37:04.402
You need guns on me
for it to be a Mexican standoff.

1292
01:37:05.069 --> 01:37:08.156
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.

1293
01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:11.576
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.

1294
01:37:11.617 --> 01:37:14.037
That's a Mexican standoff,
and that was not the deal.

1295
01:37:14.078 --> 01:37:15.747
No trust, no deal.

1296
01:37:31.637 --> 01:37:33.264
All right, Aldo.

1297
01:37:34.932 --> 01:37:35.975
Fine.

1298
01:37:39.437 --> 01:37:42.815
Just take that fucking traitor,
and get her out of my sight.

1299
01:37:54.952 --> 01:37:58.331
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.

1300
01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:14.472
Before we yank that slug out you,
you need to answer a few questions.

1301
01:38:14.514 --> 01:38:16.307
Few questions about what?

1302
01:38:16.808 --> 01:38:18.976
About I got three men dead back there.

1303
01:38:19.102 --> 01:38:21.854
Why don't you try telling us
what the fuck happened?

1304
01:38:21.979 --> 01:38:25.858
The British officer blew his German act
and the Gestapo major saw it.

1305
01:38:26.984 --> 01:38:29.195
Before we get into who shot John,

1306
01:38:30.029 --> 01:38:34.200
why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous
in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?

1307
01:38:39.122 --> 01:38:41.541
I can see since you didn't see
what happened inside,

1308
01:38:41.666 --> 01:38:44.335
that the Nazis being there must look odd.

1309
01:38:44.377 --> 01:38:46.879
Yeah, we got a word
for that kind of odd in English.

1310
01:38:47.004 --> 01:38:49.006
It's called suspicious.

1311
01:38:53.219 --> 01:38:55.054
Everybody needs to calm down.

1312
01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:57.849
You're letting your imagination
get the better of you.

1313
01:38:59.183 --> 01:39:02.186
You met the sergeant yourself. Willi.

1314
01:39:02.228 --> 01:39:04.063
You remember him, don't you?

1315
01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:05.189
Yeah, I remember him.

1316
01:39:05.314 --> 01:39:09.026
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...

1317
01:39:09.068 --> 01:39:10.820
He had just become a father!

1318
01:39:10.862 --> 01:39:14.699
His commanding officer gave him
and his mates the night off to celebrate.

1319
01:39:18.077 --> 01:39:24.375
The Germans being there was either
a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.

1320
01:39:24.417 --> 01:39:26.169
It couldn't be both.

1321
01:39:36.387 --> 01:39:38.264
How'd the shooting start?

1322
01:39:38.389 --> 01:39:40.892
The Englishman gave himself away.

1323
01:39:40.933 --> 01:39:42.560
How'd he do that?

1324
01:39:43.769 --> 01:39:46.063
He ordered three glasses.

1325
01:39:47.231 --> 01:39:49.108
We order three glasses.

1326
01:39:49.358 --> 01:39:51.277
That's the German three.

1327
01:39:52.236 --> 01:39:53.946
The other looks odd.

1328
01:39:54.572 --> 01:39:56.908
Germans would and did notice it.

1329
01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:07.627
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans

1330
01:40:07.752 --> 01:40:10.296
and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to.

1331
01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:12.298
What was the next step?

1332
01:40:12.548 --> 01:40:13.758
Tuxedos.

1333
01:40:14.425 --> 01:40:17.220
To get them into the premiere
wearing military uniforms

1334
01:40:17.261 --> 01:40:20.097
with all the military there
would've been suicide.

1335
01:40:22.058 --> 01:40:25.311
But going as members
of the German film industry,

1336
01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:28.940
they wear tuxedos
and fit in with everybody else.

1337
01:40:30.399 --> 01:40:33.611
I arranged for the tailor
to fit three tuxedos tonight.

1338
01:40:34.779 --> 01:40:37.240
How'd you intend to get them
in that premiere?

1339
01:40:37.281 --> 01:40:38.950
Hand me my purse.

1340
01:40:48.793 --> 01:40:51.170
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.

1341
01:40:52.505 --> 01:40:56.509
The other two were going
as a German cameraman and his assistant.

1342
01:40:57.677 --> 01:40:59.345
You still get us in that premiere?

1343
01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:02.598
You speak German
better than your friends? No.

1344
01:41:03.015 --> 01:41:05.184
Have I been shot? Yes!

1345
01:41:05.768 --> 01:41:10.606
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique
up a red carpet anytime soon.

1346
01:41:11.607 --> 01:41:14.026
Least of all, by tomorrow night.

1347
01:41:26.872 --> 01:41:30.209
However, there's something you don't know.

1348
01:41:32.336 --> 01:41:36.382
There've been two recent developments
regarding Operation Kino.

1349
01:41:38.175 --> 01:41:43.222
One, the venue has been changed
from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.

1350
01:41:43.806 --> 01:41:47.018
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.

1351
01:41:47.059 --> 01:41:50.021
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff
so damn peculiar?

1352
01:41:50.146 --> 01:41:53.858
It probably has something to do
with the second development.

1353
01:41:54.191 --> 01:41:55.484
Which is?

1354
01:41:59.739 --> 01:42:02.366
Der Führer is attending the premiere.

1355
01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:04.910
I've been rethinking my position...

1356
01:42:06.078 --> 01:42:12.710
...in regards to your Paris premiere
of "Nation's Pride."

1357
01:42:14.295 --> 01:42:16.130
As the weeks have gone on...

1358
01:42:17.465 --> 01:42:19.634
...and the Americans are on the beach...

1359
01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:23.638
...I do find myself thinking more and more...

1360
01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:25.723
...about this Private Zoller.

1361
01:42:27.058 --> 01:42:29.226
This boy has done something tremendous
for us.

1362
01:42:31.062 --> 01:42:32.229
And I'm beginning to think...

1363
01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.484
...my participation in this event
could be meaningful.

1364
01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:38.736
Fuck a duck!

1365
01:42:47.411 --> 01:42:49.246
What are you thinking?

1366
01:42:50.539 --> 01:42:52.750
I'm thinking getting a whack
at planting old Uncle Adolf

1367
01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:54.710
makes this horse a different color.

1368
01:42:54.752 --> 01:42:56.420
What is that supposed to mean?

1369
01:42:56.545 --> 01:42:58.422
It means you getting us in that premiere.

1370
01:42:58.547 --> 01:43:01.425
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.

1371
01:43:02.051 --> 01:43:04.428
Bye-bye, acting career. Fun while it lasted.

1372
01:43:04.553 --> 01:43:07.181
How do you expect me
to walk the red carpet?

1373
01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.603
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug
out your gam.

1374
01:43:12.687 --> 01:43:14.730
He's going to wrap it up in a cast,

1375
01:43:14.772 --> 01:43:16.941
and you got a good
how-I-broke-my-leg-mountain-climbing story.

1376
01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:19.694
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?

1377
01:43:19.777 --> 01:43:23.030
I don't. I like smoking, drinking
and ordering in restaurants.

1378
01:43:23.114 --> 01:43:24.949
But I see your point.

1379
01:43:25.199 --> 01:43:28.703
We fill you up with morphine
till it's coming out your ears

1380
01:43:28.786 --> 01:43:32.039
and just limp your little ass
up that rouge carpet.

1381
01:43:33.541 --> 01:43:36.794
I know this is a silly question before I ask it,

1382
01:43:36.919 --> 01:43:42.299
but can you Americans speak
any other language than English?

1383
01:43:43.134 --> 01:43:45.386
We both speak a little Italian.

1384
01:43:45.469 --> 01:43:47.972
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.

1385
01:43:49.724 --> 01:43:53.144
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.

1386
01:43:53.978 --> 01:43:56.814
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.

1387
01:44:00.735 --> 01:44:04.572
So you mumble Italian
and brazen through it. Is that the plan?

1388
01:44:04.822 --> 01:44:06.323
That's about it.

1389
01:44:10.161 --> 01:44:11.245
That sounds good.

1390
01:44:11.328 --> 01:44:13.664
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do? Go home?

1391
01:44:13.789 --> 01:44:15.624
No, that sounds good.

1392
01:44:16.459 --> 01:44:20.337
If you don't blow it, with that,
I can get you in the building.

1393
01:44:21.338 --> 01:44:22.423
Who does what?

1394
01:44:22.506 --> 01:44:26.677
Well, I speak the most Italian,
so I'll be your escort.

1395
01:44:26.761 --> 01:44:29.847
Donowitz speaks second most,
so he'll be your Italian cameraman.

1396
01:44:29.972 --> 01:44:32.933
Omar, third most. He'll be Donny's assistant.

1397
01:44:33.517 --> 01:44:34.643
I don't speak Italian.

1398
01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:38.105
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.

1399
01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:39.690
In fact,
why don't you start practicing right now?

1400
01:44:47.364 --> 01:44:49.200
You've moved up in the world.

1401
01:44:51.368 --> 01:44:53.370
Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.

1402
01:44:54.705 --> 01:44:58.709
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.

1403
01:45:04.215 --> 01:45:05.257
And that one's name is...

1404
01:45:05.341 --> 01:45:06.425
...Wilhelm Wicki.

1405
01:45:07.176 --> 01:45:10.095
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who
immigrated to the United States...

1406
01:45:10.304 --> 01:45:13.224
...when things began turning sour
for the Israelites.

1407
01:45:13.349 --> 01:45:16.101
They are the two German-born
members of the Basterds.

1408
01:45:16.727 --> 01:45:20.564
They've been known to don German
uniforms, to ambush squads.

1409
01:45:22.066 --> 01:45:23.234
What brings you all the way out here?

1410
01:45:30.032 --> 01:45:31.200
But that doesn't look like this.

1411
01:45:34.119 --> 01:45:35.162
This is odd.

1412
01:45:51.428 --> 01:45:52.680
It would appear somebody's missing.

1413
01:45:53.556 --> 01:45:54.974
Somebody fashionable.

1414
01:45:56.767 --> 01:45:57.810
Everybody out!

1415
01:46:12.658 --> 01:46:14.493
"To Max, with love."

1416
01:46:18.372 --> 01:46:21.709
Bridget von Hammersmark.

1417
01:46:29.008 --> 01:46:31.135
Chapter Five

1418
01:46:31.218 --> 01:46:36.724
REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE

1419
01:46:38.642 --> 01:46:42.980
Night of "NATION'S PRIDE" premiere

1420
01:48:07.898 --> 01:48:09.024
Remember...in English.

1421
01:48:09.108 --> 01:48:10.192
Yes.

1422
01:48:10.943 --> 01:48:12.027
Action.

1423
01:48:12.444 --> 01:48:13.612
But how do we get it developed?

1424
01:48:14.863 --> 01:48:17.449
Only a suicidal idiot like us
would develop that footage.

1425
01:48:18.283 --> 01:48:20.285
And suppose someone would develop
the footage...

1426
01:48:20.452 --> 01:48:22.413
...how do we get a 35mm
print with a soundtrack?

1427
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:26.458
We find somebody who can develop
and process a 35mm print with a soundtrack.

1428
01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:28.252
And we make them do it...

1429
01:48:28.961 --> 01:48:30.087
...or we kill them.

1430
01:48:34.341 --> 01:48:36.260
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.

1431
01:48:37.261 --> 01:48:38.345
You either do what the fuck we tell you...

1432
01:48:38.429 --> 01:48:39.596
...or I'll bury this axe
in your collaborating skull.

1433
01:48:40.764 --> 01:48:41.849
I'm not a collaborator.

1434
01:48:41.932 --> 01:48:43.809
Marcel, do his wife and children know you?

1435
01:48:43.934 --> 01:48:44.935
Yes.

1436
01:48:45.019 --> 01:48:47.438
Then after we kill this dog
for the Germans...

1437
01:48:47.646 --> 01:48:49.356
...we'll go and silence them.

1438
01:50:29.915 --> 01:50:31.208
Jannings, come on, show the ring.

1439
01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:32.543
Come on, come on. There you go!

1440
01:50:33.627 --> 01:50:37.548
Fredrick, have a look at it. This is
the highest artistic honor that I give.

1441
01:50:37.631 --> 01:50:40.717
-Herr Doctor, I'm also feeling very honored.
-You deserve it, my dear Jannings!

1442
01:50:40.926 --> 01:50:44.221
But I believe after the premiere today,
we have a new candidate.

1443
01:51:05.951 --> 01:51:07.077
Ah, Emmanuelle...

1444
01:51:07.619 --> 01:51:11.373
...I'd like you to meet the
greatest actor in the world...

1445
01:51:11.748 --> 01:51:12.875
...Emil Jannings.

1446
01:51:14.084 --> 01:51:16.795
Mademoiselle, I'm pleased to meet you.

1447
01:51:17.254 --> 01:51:18.380
You have a beautiful cinema.

1448
01:51:31.226 --> 01:51:32.269
Thank you, Hermann.

1449
01:51:57.502 --> 01:51:58.795
Fraulein von Hammersmark.

1450
01:52:03.967 --> 01:52:05.135
Colonel Landa, it's been years.

1451
01:52:05.969 --> 01:52:07.971
Dashing as ever, I see.

1452
01:52:10.641 --> 01:52:12.935
So what's happened to your lovely leg?

1453
01:52:13.644 --> 01:52:18.148
A by-product of kicking ass in
the German cinema, no doubt.

1454
01:52:18.815 --> 01:52:20.859
Save your flattery, you old dog.

1455
01:52:21.318 --> 01:52:25.989
I know too many of your former conquests
to fall into that honey pot.

1456
01:52:26.281 --> 01:52:27.532
Seriously, what happened?

1457
01:52:28.533 --> 01:52:31.995
Well, I tried my hand,
foolishly I might add...

1458
01:52:33.372 --> 01:52:34.831
...at mountain climbing.

1459
01:52:36.291 --> 01:52:37.459
And this is the result.

1460
01:52:37.668 --> 01:52:38.669
Mountain climbing?

1461
01:52:38.794 --> 01:52:40.879
That's how you injured your leg
-mountain climbing?

1462
01:52:41.004 --> 01:52:42.631
Believe it or not, yes it is.

1463
01:53:06.405 --> 01:53:09.866
Forgive me, fraulein. I don't mean to
laugh at your misfortune.

1464
01:53:09.992 --> 01:53:11.702
It's just mountain climbing?

1465
01:53:13.161 --> 01:53:15.747
I'm curious, fraulein,
what could have ever compelled you

1466
01:53:15.872 --> 01:53:18.083
to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?

1467
01:53:21.044 --> 01:53:23.297
Well, I shan't be doing it again,
I can tell you that.

1468
01:53:25.215 --> 01:53:27.134
That cast looks as fresh
as my old Uncle Gustav.

1469
01:53:27.801 --> 01:53:30.345
When were you climbing this mountain,
last night?

1470
01:53:31.888 --> 01:53:33.223
Very good eye, Colonel.

1471
01:53:34.224 --> 01:53:35.892
It happened yesterday morning.

1472
01:53:36.476 --> 01:53:38.312
And where in Paris is this mountain?

1473
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:44.568
No, I'm just teasing you, fraulein.

1474
01:53:44.818 --> 01:53:47.529
You know me, I tease rough.

1475
01:53:47.738 --> 01:53:49.323
So, who are your three
handsome escorts?

1476
01:53:51.742 --> 01:53:54.745
I'm afraid neither three speak
a word of German.

1477
01:53:55.412 --> 01:53:57.205
They're friends of mine from Italy.

1478
01:53:58.332 --> 01:54:03.503
This is a wonderful Italian
stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi.

1479
01:54:05.172 --> 01:54:08.216
A very talented cameraman,
Antonio Margheriti.

1480
01:54:09.593 --> 01:54:12.721
And Antonio's camera assistant
Dominick Decocco.

1481
01:54:15.432 --> 01:54:20.103
Gentlemen, this is an old friend,
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.

1482
01:54:21.855 --> 01:54:22.939
Hello.

1483
01:54:23.190 --> 01:54:25.108
Gentlemen, it's a pleasure...

1484
01:54:25.442 --> 01:54:27.527
...the friends of our cherished star,
admired by all of us,

1485
01:54:27.611 --> 01:54:29.363
this outright jewel of our culture...

1486
01:54:29.738 --> 01:54:33.742
...are naturally going to be under my personal
protection for the duration of their stay.

1487
01:54:37.287 --> 01:54:38.372
Thank you.

1488
01:54:39.247 --> 01:54:40.374
Gorlomi?

1489
01:54:40.791 --> 01:54:42.125
Am I saying it correctly?

1490
01:54:43.543 --> 01:54:45.212
Yes - 'er, correct.

1491
01:54:45.379 --> 01:54:46.880
Gorlomi?

1492
01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:49.633
Say it for me once please...?

1493
01:54:50.759 --> 01:54:51.927
Gorlomi.

1494
01:54:52.969 --> 01:54:54.137
I'm sorry, again...?

1495
01:54:55.472 --> 01:54:56.640
Gorlomi.

1496
01:54:56.723 --> 01:54:58.100
Once more...?

1497
01:55:01.144 --> 01:55:02.229
Gorlomi.

1498
01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:04.981
What's your name again...?

1499
01:55:05.315 --> 01:55:07.234
Antonio Margheriti.

1500
01:55:08.568 --> 01:55:09.611
Again...?

1501
01:55:09.778 --> 01:55:11.321
Margheriti.

1502
01:55:11.613 --> 01:55:15.409
One more time, but let me
really hear the music in it!

1503
01:55:16.243 --> 01:55:18.495
Margheriti.

1504
01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:20.080
HANS: Margheriti.

1505
01:55:20.163 --> 01:55:21.289
And you...?

1506
01:55:21.331 --> 01:55:22.499
Dominick Decocco.

1507
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:24.793
Dominick Decocco.

1508
01:55:27.170 --> 01:55:29.005
Well, my two cameraman friends
need to find their seats.

1509
01:55:30.298 --> 01:55:31.842
Let me see your tickets.

1510
01:55:34.803 --> 01:55:36.263
I suppose you getting premiere tickets

1511
01:55:36.346 --> 01:55:38.432
for your friends wouldn't be
the most difficult thing...

1512
01:55:38.515 --> 01:55:39.933
...for a star of your status.

1513
01:55:41.268 --> 01:55:44.438
0023 and 0024.

1514
01:55:44.521 --> 01:55:47.691
That shouldn't be too difficult to find,
goodbye.

1515
01:57:08.688 --> 01:57:10.482
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux.

1516
01:57:25.497 --> 01:57:27.123
I have to go down and socialize
with these Hun pigs.

1517
01:57:27.958 --> 01:57:29.167
Let's go over it again.

1518
01:57:30.961 --> 01:57:32.671
Reel one is on the first projector.

1519
01:57:33.797 --> 01:57:34.839
Reel two...

1520
01:57:34.923 --> 01:57:35.966
...is on the second.

1521
01:57:36.841 --> 01:57:38.218
The third one is on the spool.

1522
01:57:40.679 --> 01:57:42.847
And the fourth one is ready to go.

1523
01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.227
Okay, the big sniper battle
in the film...

1524
01:57:47.561 --> 01:57:49.813
...begins around the middle
of the third reel.

1525
01:57:50.689 --> 01:57:52.732
Our film comes in on the fourth reel.

1526
01:57:53.483 --> 01:57:55.402
Somewhere towards the end
of the third reel...

1527
01:57:55.527 --> 01:57:57.070
...go down and lock the doors
of the auditorium.

1528
01:57:57.696 --> 01:57:59.990
Then take your place behind the
screen and wait for my cue.

1529
01:58:02.617 --> 01:58:04.077
Then burn it down.

1530
01:58:16.339 --> 01:58:17.424
Take your seats.

1531
01:58:17.507 --> 01:58:18.842
The show is about to begin.

1532
01:58:19.384 --> 01:58:22.262
Everybody, please take your seats.
The show is about to begin.

1533
01:58:23.513 --> 01:58:24.556
We'll see you later.

1534
01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:26.808
Not so fast.

1535
01:58:26.891 --> 01:58:28.059
A glass of champagne...

1536
01:58:29.603 --> 01:58:31.146
...to toast "Nation's Pride."

1537
01:58:38.778 --> 01:58:41.573
My fraulein, may I have a word
with you in private?

1538
01:58:43.283 --> 01:58:44.326
Certainly.

1539
01:58:45.535 --> 01:58:46.620
Excuse us.

1540
01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:00.300
Have a seat, my fraulein.

1541
01:59:04.846 --> 01:59:05.930
May I?

1542
01:59:12.937 --> 01:59:14.522
Mademoiselle Mimieux allowed me...

1543
01:59:14.606 --> 01:59:17.025
...to set up camp in her office
for the time being.

1544
01:59:25.992 --> 01:59:27.452
Let me see your foot.

1545
01:59:28.662 --> 01:59:29.746
I beg your pardon?

1546
01:59:30.789 --> 01:59:32.207
Put your foot in my lap.

1547
01:59:37.462 --> 01:59:39.214
Hans, you embarrass me.

1548
02:00:10.495 --> 02:00:15.333
Could you please reach into
the right pocket of my coat...

1549
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:17.210
...and give me what you find in there.

1550
02:00:51.995 --> 02:00:53.079
May I?

1551
02:01:12.348 --> 02:01:16.603
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."

1552
02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:24.110
What now, Colonel?

1553
02:02:15.495 --> 02:02:16.830
The guy in the white smoking jacket.

1554
02:02:20.124 --> 02:02:24.712
ALDO: Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck. Fuck you!

1555
02:02:24.838 --> 02:02:26.840
Bunch of shithead fuck.

1556
02:02:29.759 --> 02:02:31.302
Fuck you, too!

1557
02:02:33.930 --> 02:02:38.059
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.

1558
02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:42.063
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
God damn you! Get off!

1559
02:02:47.068 --> 02:02:48.152
Hmm.

1560
02:02:49.404 --> 02:02:50.530
Clever.

1561
02:02:53.074 --> 02:02:55.076
I informed the Führer that the
audience has taken their seats.

1562
02:02:55.159 --> 02:02:56.494
He should arrive any minute.

1563
02:02:57.829 --> 02:02:58.872
Thank you, Hans.

1564
02:03:00.456 --> 02:03:01.541
ALDO: You Jerry-banging,
Limburg-smelling...

1565
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:03.793
Let go.

1566
02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:10.717
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?

1567
02:03:11.676 --> 02:03:13.052
Hans Landa.

1568
02:03:15.221 --> 02:03:17.599
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.

1569
02:03:18.516 --> 02:03:21.352
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.

1570
02:03:21.436 --> 02:03:22.979
My hands to be exact.

1571
02:03:23.062 --> 02:03:26.774
And they've been waiting a long time
to touch you.

1572
02:03:30.653 --> 02:03:32.447
Caught you flinching.

1573
02:03:36.659 --> 02:03:38.870
ALDO: Touch me again,
Kraut-burger.

1574
02:03:54.719 --> 02:03:57.263
ALDO: Utivich?
UTIVICH: Is that you, Lieutenant?

1575
02:03:57.347 --> 02:03:58.389
ALDO: Yeah.

1576
02:03:58.973 --> 02:04:01.100
UTIVICH: Do you know
what happened to Donny?

1577
02:04:01.184 --> 02:04:02.268
Omar?

1578
02:04:02.936 --> 02:04:05.271
-The woman?
-ALDO: No, I do not.

1579
02:04:51.859 --> 02:04:55.405
Tell me, Aldo,
if I were sitting where you're sitting,

1580
02:04:55.488 --> 02:04:57.448
would you show me mercy?

1581
02:05:02.036 --> 02:05:03.162
Nope.

1582
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:07.083
What is that English expression
about shoes and feet?

1583
02:05:07.166 --> 02:05:10.044
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot."
Yeah, I was just thinking that.

1584
02:05:11.295 --> 02:05:12.380
You may leave us.

1585
02:05:13.506 --> 02:05:14.549
But stay alert outside.

1586
02:05:23.725 --> 02:05:26.602
So you're Aldo the Apache.

1587
02:05:27.729 --> 02:05:30.732
-So you're The Jew Hunter.
-I'm a detective.

1588
02:05:30.815 --> 02:05:32.650
A damn good detective.

1589
02:05:32.984 --> 02:05:34.610
Finding people is my specialty,

1590
02:05:34.694 --> 02:05:37.113
so naturally, I worked for the Nazis
finding people.

1591
02:05:37.196 --> 02:05:40.324
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?

1592
02:05:41.659 --> 02:05:43.536
Just a name that stuck.

1593
02:05:43.995 --> 02:05:46.789
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.

1594
02:05:48.249 --> 02:05:51.419
Do you control the nicknames
your enemies bestow on you?

1595
02:05:51.502 --> 02:05:54.005
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?

1596
02:05:55.089 --> 02:05:57.216
What do you mean the Little Man?

1597
02:05:57.300 --> 02:05:59.093
Germans' nickname for you.

1598
02:05:59.177 --> 02:06:02.221
The Germans' nickname for me
is the Little Man?

1599
02:06:02.597 --> 02:06:07.143
And as if to make my point, I'm a little
surprised how tall you were in real life.

1600
02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:09.645
I mean, you're a little fellow,
but not circus-midget little,

1601
02:06:09.729 --> 02:06:11.522
as your reputation would suggest.

1602
02:06:11.606 --> 02:06:13.149
Where's my men?

1603
02:06:13.691 --> 02:06:16.027
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?

1604
02:06:18.863 --> 02:06:22.075
Well, let's just say,
she got what she deserved.

1605
02:06:24.535 --> 02:06:27.080
And when you purchase friends like
Bridget von Hammersmark,

1606
02:06:27.163 --> 02:06:29.165
you get what you pay for.

1607
02:06:30.583 --> 02:06:35.588
Now as far as your paesanos,
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...

1608
02:06:35.671 --> 02:06:37.548
How you know our names?

1609
02:06:38.174 --> 02:06:39.759
Lieutenant Aldo,

1610
02:06:41.636 --> 02:06:43.054
if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate

1611
02:06:43.137 --> 02:06:46.516
every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors,

1612
02:06:48.935 --> 02:06:52.522
we simply aren't operating on the level
of mutual respect I assumed.

1613
02:06:52.605 --> 02:06:54.190
No, I guess not.

1614
02:06:54.398 --> 02:06:59.529
Well, back to the whereabouts
of your two Italian saboteurs.

1615
02:07:02.698 --> 02:07:04.450
As of this moment,

1616
02:07:04.534 --> 02:07:09.372
both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting
in the very seats we left them in.

1617
02:07:09.997 --> 02:07:13.584
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24,
if my memory serves.

1618
02:07:14.377 --> 02:07:17.797
Explosives still around their ankles,
still ready to explode.

1619
02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:21.134
And your mission,
some would call a terrorist plot,

1620
02:07:21.217 --> 02:07:23.761
as of this moment, is still a go.

1621
02:07:23.845 --> 02:07:27.140
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next? Eliza on Ice?

1622
02:07:27.223 --> 02:07:28.432
However,

1623
02:07:30.351 --> 02:07:33.479
all I have to do is pick up
this phone right here,

1624
02:07:33.563 --> 02:07:36.399
inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.

1625
02:07:38.776 --> 02:07:43.990
If they're still here, and if they're still alive,
and that's one big if,

1626
02:07:45.324 --> 02:07:48.870
there ain't no way you're going to take
them boys without setting off them bombs.

1627
02:07:48.953 --> 02:07:50.705
I have no doubt.

1628
02:07:50.788 --> 02:07:54.125
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.

1629
02:07:54.208 --> 02:07:57.086
And, yes, Goebbels will be
very, very, very mad at you

1630
02:07:57.170 --> 02:07:59.255
for what you've done to his big night.

1631
02:08:00.506 --> 02:08:02.800
But you won't get Hitler,
you won't get Goebbels,

1632
02:08:02.884 --> 02:08:05.928
you won't get Göring,
and you won't get Bormann.

1633
02:08:06.012 --> 02:08:08.598
And you need all four to end the war.

1634
02:08:10.266 --> 02:08:13.477
But if I don't pick up this phone right here,

1635
02:08:13.561 --> 02:08:15.813
you may very well get all four.

1636
02:08:17.106 --> 02:08:21.944
And if you get all four, you end the war

1637
02:08:23.196 --> 02:08:24.447
tonight.

1638
02:08:25.823 --> 02:08:27.325
So, gentlemen,

1639
02:08:28.075 --> 02:08:31.287
let's discuss the prospect
of ending the war tonight.

1640
02:08:34.165 --> 02:08:36.042
So, the way I see it,

1641
02:08:36.125 --> 02:08:40.338
since Hitler's death or possible rescue
rests solely on my reaction,

1642
02:08:41.005 --> 02:08:42.590
if I do nothing,

1643
02:08:43.007 --> 02:08:47.053
it's as if I'm causing his death even more
than yourselves. Wouldn't you agree?

1644
02:08:47.678 --> 02:08:49.055
I guess so.

1645
02:08:51.641 --> 02:08:53.684
How about you, Utivich?

1646
02:08:53.768 --> 02:08:55.353
I guess so, too.

1647
02:09:00.858 --> 02:09:02.109
Gentlemen, I have no intention

1648
02:09:02.193 --> 02:09:05.321
of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels
and killing Göring and killing Bormann,

1649
02:09:05.404 --> 02:09:08.157
not to mention winning the war
single-handedly for the Allies,

1650
02:09:08.241 --> 02:09:11.953
only later to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.

1651
02:09:14.038 --> 02:09:17.583
If you want to win the war tonight,

1652
02:09:19.210 --> 02:09:21.379
we have to make a deal.

1653
02:09:24.382 --> 02:09:26.133
What kind of deal?

1654
02:09:26.217 --> 02:09:28.761
The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.

1655
02:09:28.844 --> 02:09:33.391
However, I'm sure this mission of yours
has a commanding officer.

1656
02:09:34.392 --> 02:09:35.726
A general.

1657
02:09:36.394 --> 02:09:38.062
I'm betting for...

1658
02:09:39.772 --> 02:09:41.691
OSS would be my guess.

1659
02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:48.072
That's a bingo!

1660
02:09:51.075 --> 02:09:53.577
Is that the way you say it? "That's a bingo."

1661
02:09:53.661 --> 02:09:55.579
You just say, "Bingo."

1662
02:09:55.663 --> 02:09:57.873
Bingo! How fun.

1663
02:10:00.293 --> 02:10:03.379
But I digress. Where were we?
Yeah! Make a deal.

1664
02:10:03.921 --> 02:10:08.384
Over there is a very capable
two-way radio and sitting behind it

1665
02:10:08.467 --> 02:10:12.596
is a more than capable radio operator
named Hermann.

1666
02:10:12.930 --> 02:10:15.266
Get me someone
on the other end of that radio

1667
02:10:15.349 --> 02:10:18.436
with the power of the pen to authorize my,

1668
02:10:18.519 --> 02:10:21.439
let's call it, the terms
of my conditional surrender.

1669
02:10:21.522 --> 02:10:23.899
If that tastes better going down.

1670
02:10:24.692 --> 02:10:25.943
You know, where I'm from...

1671
02:10:26.027 --> 02:10:27.945
Yeah? Where is that exactly?

1672
02:10:28.029 --> 02:10:30.072
Maynardville, Tennessee.

1673
02:10:30.156 --> 02:10:32.575
I've done my share of bootlegging.

1674
02:10:32.742 --> 02:10:36.412
Up there, if you engage in what the federal
government calls illegal activity,

1675
02:10:36.537 --> 02:10:38.664
but what we call just a man trying
to make a living for his family

1676
02:10:38.748 --> 02:10:43.169
selling moonshine liquor,
it behooves oneself to keep his wits.

1677
02:10:45.087 --> 02:10:48.549
Long story short, we hear
a story too good to be true,

1678
02:10:49.216 --> 02:10:50.426
it ain't.

1679
02:10:52.261 --> 02:10:55.097
Sitting in your chair,
I would probably say the same thing,

1680
02:10:55.181 --> 02:10:59.852
and 999,999 times out of a million,
you would be correct.

1681
02:11:01.854 --> 02:11:05.441
But in the pages of history,
every once in a while,

1682
02:11:06.025 --> 02:11:09.403
fate reaches out and extends its hand.

1683
02:11:16.243 --> 02:11:18.204
What shall the history books read?

1684
02:11:45.064 --> 02:11:48.275
MAN: I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.

1685
02:11:49.652 --> 02:11:51.320
Sarge, that tower...

1686
02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:12.800
MAN: The tower stands!

1687
02:12:15.511 --> 02:12:16.595
Gum?

1688
02:12:19.974 --> 02:12:22.351
Psst! Psst!

1689
02:13:03.893 --> 02:13:05.060
It's time.

1690
02:13:06.187 --> 02:13:08.981
I should go look the auditorium and
take my place behind the screen.

1691
02:14:52.501 --> 02:14:54.753
HANS: So when the military history
of this night is written,

1692
02:14:54.837 --> 02:14:58.507
it will be recorded that I
was part of Operation Kino

1693
02:14:58.632 --> 02:15:01.343
from the very beginning as a double agent.

1694
02:15:01.468 --> 02:15:05.514
Anything I've done in my guise
as an SS Colonel

1695
02:15:05.598 --> 02:15:08.642
was sanctioned by the OSS
as a necessary evil

1696
02:15:08.684 --> 02:15:11.395
to establish my cover with the Germans.

1697
02:15:11.687 --> 02:15:14.982
And it was my placement
of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite

1698
02:15:15.024 --> 02:15:18.027
in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box
that assured their demise.

1699
02:15:19.695 --> 02:15:21.697
I informed the Führer that the
audience has taken their seats.

1700
02:15:21.739 --> 02:15:23.157
He should arrive any minute.

1701
02:15:24.533 --> 02:15:25.576
Thank you, Hans.

1702
02:15:35.085 --> 02:15:38.172
By the way, that last part is actually true.

1703
02:15:38.213 --> 02:15:43.177
I want my full military pension
and benefits under my proper rank.

1704
02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:45.888
I want to receive
the Congressional Medal of Honor

1705
02:15:46.013 --> 02:15:49.933
for my invaluable assistance
in the toppling of the Third Reich.

1706
02:15:51.393 --> 02:15:54.438
In fact, I want all the members
of Operation Kino

1707
02:15:54.563 --> 02:15:57.441
to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

1708
02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:01.570
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.

1709
02:16:01.904 --> 02:16:05.115
And I would like
the United States of America

1710
02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:09.244
to purchase property for me
on Nantucket Island

1711
02:16:09.370 --> 02:16:12.623
as a reward for all
the countless lives I've saved

1712
02:16:12.748 --> 02:16:15.042
by bringing the tyranny
of the National Socialist Party

1713
02:16:15.084 --> 02:16:18.754
to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?

1714
02:16:20.464 --> 02:16:23.967
I look toward to seeing you
face to face as well, sir.

1715
02:16:24.885 --> 02:16:27.096
Lieutenant Raine? Right here.

1716
02:16:30.265 --> 02:16:31.475
Yes, sir.

1717
02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:35.312
GENERAL: Colonel Landa will put you
and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.

1718
02:16:35.437 --> 02:16:39.775
Then he and his radio operator will
get in the truck and drive to our lines.

1719
02:16:39.900 --> 02:16:44.446
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa
and his man will surrender to you.

1720
02:16:44.571 --> 02:16:47.116
You will then take over driving of the truck

1721
02:16:47.157 --> 02:16:50.577
and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?

1722
02:16:50.619 --> 02:16:51.787
Yes, sir.

1723
02:16:51.829 --> 02:16:53.288
Over and out.

1724
02:17:18.605 --> 02:17:21.650
Herr Dr. Goebbels, excuse me.
Could I go out for a moment?

1725
02:17:22.025 --> 02:17:23.485
Perfectly understandable, my boy.

1726
02:17:23.527 --> 02:17:25.320
You go now,
and we'll see you after the show.

1727
02:18:33.096 --> 02:18:34.223
Who is it?

1728
02:18:34.348 --> 02:18:35.390
Fredrick!

1729
02:18:36.850 --> 02:18:37.893
Shit.

1730
02:18:42.397 --> 02:18:44.691
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back.

1731
02:18:45.067 --> 02:18:46.610
That actor in the movie stinks.

1732
02:18:48.904 --> 02:18:50.072
What are you doing here?

1733
02:18:50.239 --> 02:18:51.365
I came to visit you.

1734
02:18:52.699 --> 02:18:53.742
Can't you see how busy I am?

1735
02:18:54.034 --> 02:18:55.536
Then allow me to lend an assist.

1736
02:18:56.745 --> 02:18:58.580
Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.

1737
02:18:59.581 --> 02:19:01.917
This is your premiere,
you need to be out there with them.

1738
02:19:05.045 --> 02:19:06.129
Normally, you would be right.

1739
02:19:07.256 --> 02:19:08.590
And for all the other films I do...

1740
02:19:09.258 --> 02:19:12.135
...I intend to endure evenings like tonight,
in the proper spirit.

1741
02:19:14.304 --> 02:19:15.556
However, the fact remains...

1742
02:19:16.598 --> 02:19:18.767
...this film is based on my military exploits.

1743
02:19:19.393 --> 02:19:22.980
And in this case,
my exploits consisted of killing many men.

1744
02:19:24.439 --> 02:19:26.483
Consequently, the part of
the film that's playing now...

1745
02:19:28.944 --> 02:19:30.279
...I don't like watching this part.

1746
02:19:32.114 --> 02:19:33.949
-I am sorry, Fredrick, but...
-So, I thought...

1747
02:19:34.283 --> 02:19:36.577
...I'd come up here and do what I do best...

1748
02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:37.953
...annoy you.

1749
02:19:38.954 --> 02:19:41.957
And from the look on your face,
it would appear I haven't lost my touch.

1750
02:19:43.625 --> 02:19:45.627
Are you so used to
the Nazis kissing your ass...

1751
02:19:45.752 --> 02:19:47.254
...you've forgotten what the word
"no" means?

1752
02:19:47.796 --> 02:19:49.798
No...you can't be here!

1753
02:19:49.965 --> 02:19:50.966
Now go away!

1754
02:19:53.969 --> 02:19:54.970
Fredrick, you hurt me.

1755
02:19:55.304 --> 02:19:59.641
Well, it's nice to know
you can feel something.

1756
02:20:00.475 --> 02:20:02.311
Even if it's just physical pain.

1757
02:20:02.978 --> 02:20:04.897
I'm not a man you say, "go away" to.

1758
02:20:05.981 --> 02:20:08.317
There's over three hundred dead bodies
in Italy,

1759
02:20:08.358 --> 02:20:10.152
that if they could, would testify to that!

1760
02:20:12.738 --> 02:20:13.906
After what I've done for you...

1761
02:20:14.323 --> 02:20:16.325
...you disrespect me at your peril!

1762
02:20:16.658 --> 02:20:17.743
Lock the door.

1763
02:20:18.327 --> 02:20:19.328
What?

1764
02:20:20.662 --> 02:20:21.663
Lock the door.

1765
02:20:21.747 --> 02:20:22.831
We don't have much time.

1766
02:20:25.751 --> 02:20:26.877
Time for what?

1767
02:20:28.170 --> 02:20:29.254
Forget it!

1768
02:20:29.338 --> 02:20:30.505
--No, no, no...wait.

1769
02:20:32.174 --> 02:20:34.176
You want me to...lock the door?

1770
02:20:34.843 --> 02:20:36.011
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.

1771
02:22:37.466 --> 02:22:40.010
When I kill that guy,
you got 30 feet to get to that guard.

1772
02:22:40.135 --> 02:22:42.054
-Can you do it?
-I have to.

1773
02:23:12.250 --> 02:23:13.585
Champagne?

1774
02:23:35.857 --> 02:23:37.734
Extraordinary my dear, simply extraordinary!

1775
02:23:37.859 --> 02:23:39.111
This is your finest film yet.

1776
02:23:41.113 --> 02:23:42.447
Thank you, my Führer.

1777
02:23:44.616 --> 02:23:45.700
Thank you.

1778
02:24:05.470 --> 02:24:08.140
Who wants to send a message to Germany?

1779
02:24:08.974 --> 02:24:11.309
I have a message for Germany.

1780
02:24:14.813 --> 02:24:17.065
That you are all going to die.

1781
02:24:18.233 --> 02:24:19.401
Enough! Stop it!

1782
02:24:19.484 --> 02:24:20.569
Turn off the projector!

1783
02:24:20.819 --> 02:24:25.949
And I want you to look deep into the face
of the Jew who's going to do it!

1784
02:24:27.242 --> 02:24:28.410
I don't know what's going on.
That does not belong in my movie!

1785
02:24:28.451 --> 02:24:31.413
Marcel, burn it down.

1786
02:24:32.414 --> 02:24:33.915
Oui, Shosanna.

1787
02:25:09.367 --> 02:25:11.494
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus,

1788
02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:13.455
and this is the face

1789
02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:17.709
of Jewish vengeance.

1790
02:27:14.701 --> 02:27:17.037
These are the American lines, Colonel sir.

1791
02:27:17.412 --> 02:27:18.580
Excellent, Hermann.

1792
02:27:23.418 --> 02:27:25.253
HANS: Hermann, uncuff them.

1793
02:27:43.897 --> 02:27:47.901
I'm officially surrendering myself
over to you, Lieutenant Raine.

1794
02:27:48.985 --> 02:27:50.779
We're your prisoners.

1795
02:27:51.613 --> 02:27:53.406
How about my knife?

1796
02:27:59.287 --> 02:28:01.289
Thank you very much, Colonel.

1797
02:28:01.414 --> 02:28:04.459
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands
behind his back.

1798
02:28:04.501 --> 02:28:06.753
Is that really necessary?

1799
02:28:06.795 --> 02:28:08.922
I'm a slave to appearances.

1800
02:28:12.092 --> 02:28:13.593
Scalp Hermann.

1801
02:28:15.261 --> 02:28:16.930
Are you mad?

1802
02:28:17.305 --> 02:28:19.015
What have you done?

1803
02:28:19.599 --> 02:28:22.852
I made a deal with your general
for that man's life!

1804
02:28:23.978 --> 02:28:27.357
Yeah, they made that deal. But they don't
give a fuck about him. They need you.

1805
02:28:27.482 --> 02:28:29.442
You'll be shot for this!

1806
02:28:30.026 --> 02:28:33.613
Nah, I don't think so. More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.

1807
02:28:34.864 --> 02:28:39.119
You know, Utivich and myself heard
that deal you made with the brass.

1808
02:28:39.494 --> 02:28:41.287
End the war tonight?

1809
02:28:42.664 --> 02:28:44.290
I'd make that deal.

1810
02:28:44.332 --> 02:28:46.209
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?

1811
02:28:46.334 --> 02:28:49.838
-I'd make that deal.
-I don't blame you. Damn good deal.

1812
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:53.716
And that pretty little nest
you feathered for yourself.

1813
02:28:53.842 --> 02:28:57.178
Well, if you're willing to barbecue
the whole High Command,

1814
02:28:57.303 --> 02:29:00.306
I suppose that's worth
certain considerations.

1815
02:29:01.015 --> 02:29:03.143
But I do have one question.

1816
02:29:04.185 --> 02:29:06.980
When you get to your little place
on Nantucket Island,

1817
02:29:07.021 --> 02:29:11.568
I imagine you are going to take off
that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.

1818
02:29:11.693 --> 02:29:12.986
Ain't you?

1819
02:29:16.990 --> 02:29:18.825
That's what I thought.

1820
02:29:19.534 --> 02:29:21.494
Now, that I can't abide.

1821
02:29:22.871 --> 02:29:25.165
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?

1822
02:29:25.206 --> 02:29:27.083
Not one damn bit, sir.

1823
02:29:28.710 --> 02:29:30.837
I mean, if had my way,

1824
02:29:31.337 --> 02:29:35.758
you'd wear that goddamn uniform
for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.

1825
02:29:37.260 --> 02:29:38.344
But I'm aware that ain't practical.

1826
02:29:38.386 --> 02:29:41.431
I mean, at some point,
you're going to have to take it off.

1827
02:29:41.556 --> 02:29:42.599
So,

1828
02:29:43.558 --> 02:29:47.353
I'm going to give you
a little something you can't take off.

1829
02:30:12.253 --> 02:30:14.380
You know something, Utivich?

1830
02:30:14.756 --> 02:30:17.550
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
