<i>October is inventory time</i>.

2
00:01:30.392 --> 00:01:33.979
<i>So right now, Statler Toyota is making
the best deals of the year,</i>

3
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.131
<i>on all 1985-model Toyotas.</i>

4
00:01:36.273 --> 00:01:37.883
<i>You won't find a better car,</i>

5
00:01:37.884 --> 00:01:41.262
<i>at a better price with better service
anywhere in Hill Valley.</i>

6
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:44.155
<i>That's Statler Toyota
in downtown Hill Valley.</i>

7
00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:50.212
<i>The Senate is expected
to vote on this today.</i>

8
00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:51.890
<i>In other news,</i>

9
00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:54.923
<i>officials at the Pacific Nuclear
research facility,</i>

10
00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.620
<i>have denied the rumor
that a case of missing plutonium,</i>

11
00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:00.581
<i>was in fact stolen from their vault
two weeks ago.</i>

12
00:02:00.965 --> 00:02:04.518
<i>A Libyan terrorist group had claimed
responsibility for the alleged theft.</i>

13
00:02:04.843 --> 00:02:07.785
<i>However, officials now attribute
the discrepancy,</i>

14
00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.477
<i>to a simple clerical error.</i>

15
00:02:09.932 --> 00:02:12.182
<i>The FBI, which is investigating
the matter,</i>

16
00:02:12.272 --> 00:02:13.502
<i>had no comment.</i>

17
00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:56.232
Hey Doc?

18
00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.084
Doc?

19
00:03:01.563 --> 00:03:02.807
Hello!
Anybody home?

20
00:03:03.654 --> 00:03:04.689
Einstein, come here boy.

21
00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:07.918
What's going on?
Oh, God.

22
00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:10.625
Jesus!

23
00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:13.278
That is disgusting.

24
00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:14.841
Where the hell is he?

25
00:04:39.373 --> 00:04:40.374
Rock 'n' roll.

26
00:04:49.008 --> 00:04:50.422
Yo.
<i>Marty is that you?</i>

27
00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:51.603
Hey. Hey Doc.

28
00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:53.023
Where are you?

29
00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:54.195
<i>Thank God I have found you. Listen.</i>

30
00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:56.540
<i>Can you meet me at Twin Pines
Mall tonight at 1:15.</i>

31
00:04:56.565 --> 00:04:58.226
<i>I made a breakthrough,
I will need your assistance.</i>

32
00:04:58.302 --> 00:05:00.279
Wait, wait a moment.
1:15 in the morning?

33
00:05:00.304 --> 00:05:01.804
<i>Yeah!</i>
Doc, what's going on?

34
00:05:02.463 --> 00:05:03.523
Where you been all week?

35
00:05:03.748 --> 00:05:04.347
<i>Working.</i>

36
00:05:04.448 --> 00:05:05.848
Where is Einstein, he is with you?

37
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.260
<i>Yeah, he is right here.</i>

38
00:05:07.618 --> 00:05:10.079
You know Doc, you left your
equipment on all week.

39
00:05:10.404 --> 00:05:11.499
<i>My equipment?</i>

40
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.848
<i>That reminds me Marty.</i>

41
00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:14.639
<i>You better not hook
up to the amplifier.</i>

42
00:05:14.663 --> 00:05:16.838
<i>There is a slight possibility of overload.</i>

43
00:05:16.863 --> 00:05:17.596
Yeah.

44
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.894
I will keep that in mind.
<i>Good.</i>

45
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:21.983
<i>I will see you tonight.
Don't forget now,</i>

46
00:05:21.984 --> 00:05:24.635
<i>1:15 a.m Twin Pines Mall.</i>
Right.

47
00:05:31.508 --> 00:05:33.138
<i>Are those my clocks I hear?</i>

48
00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:34.075
Yeah.

49
00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:36.290
It's 8:00. clock.

50
00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:37.453
<i>Perfect!</i>

51
00:05:37.477 --> 00:05:38.682
<i>My experiment worked!</i>

52
00:05:38.707 --> 00:05:41.177
<i>They are all exactly 25 minutes slow!</i>

53
00:05:42.353 --> 00:05:44.113
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute Doc.

54
00:05:44.897 --> 00:05:47.191
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

55
00:05:47.216 --> 00:05:48.216
<i>Precisely.</i>

56
00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:49.703
Damn!

57
00:05:50.444 --> 00:05:51.821
I am late for school.

58
00:06:51.797 --> 00:06:52.633
Oh, Jennifer.

59
00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:54.658
Marty don't go this way,
Strickland is looking for you.

60
00:06:54.717 --> 00:06:56.773
If you get caught, it will be
four tardies in a row.

61
00:06:59.054 --> 00:07:00.748
Alright, come on.
I think we are safe.

62
00:07:01.432 --> 00:07:03.232
You know this time it was not my fault.

63
00:07:03.595 --> 00:07:05.904
The doc set all his clocks
25 minutes slow.

64
00:07:05.929 --> 00:07:06.794
Doc?

65
00:07:07.247 --> 00:07:10.760
Am I to understand you are still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett Brown McFly?

66
00:07:12.354 --> 00:07:13.998
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

67
00:07:15.112 --> 00:07:18.082
And one for you McFly.
I believe that's four in a row.

68
00:07:18.824 --> 00:07:21.485
Let me give you a nickel's worth
of free advice young man.

69
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:25.039
This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous.
He is a real nutcase.

70
00:07:25.122 --> 00:07:27.612
Hang around with him,
you will end up in big trouble.

71
00:07:27.637 --> 00:07:28.722
Oh yes, sir.

72
00:07:29.627 --> 00:07:32.596
You got a real attitude problem McFly.
You are a slacker.

73
00:07:33.464 --> 00:07:36.484
You remind me of your father when
he went here, he was a slacker too.

74
00:07:37.676 --> 00:07:39.420
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

75
00:07:39.845 --> 00:07:43.556
I noticed your band is on the roster for
the dance auditions after school today.

76
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:45.081
Why even bother McFly.

77
00:07:45.105 --> 00:07:47.860
You don't have a chance.
You are too much like your old man.

78
00:07:48.062 --> 00:07:51.962
No McFly ever amounted to anything
in the history of Hill Valley.

79
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:56.055
Yeah, well, history is going to change.

80
00:07:58.364 --> 00:07:59.482
<i>Next please.</i>

81
00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:06.338
Ok, guys, let's rock 'n' roll.

82
00:08:09.083 --> 00:08:10.126
<i>Alright.</i>

83
00:08:11.252 --> 00:08:12.427
<i>We are the...</i>

84
00:08:12.828 --> 00:08:14.110
<i>We are the Pinheads.</i>

85
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:17.091
<i>One, two, three.</i>

86
00:08:36.694 --> 00:08:37.925
<i>Ok, that's enough.</i>

87
00:08:38.214 --> 00:08:40.302
<i>Thank you, thank you fellas.
Hold it.</i>

88
00:08:40.614 --> 00:08:41.839
<i>Hold it fellas.</i>

89
00:08:42.408 --> 00:08:44.277
<i>I am afraid you are just too darn loud.</i>

90
00:08:45.494 --> 00:08:46.637
<i>Next please.</i>

91
00:08:49.206 --> 00:08:50.683
<i>Next group please.</i>

92
00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.144
<i>Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson.</i>

93
00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:58.549
<i>Progress is his middle name.</i>

94
00:08:58.574 --> 00:09:00.251
Too loud, I can't believe it.

95
00:09:00.634 --> 00:09:03.387
I am never gonna get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

96
00:09:03.412 --> 00:09:05.773
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

97
00:09:05.882 --> 00:09:08.176
No, I just don't think
I am cut out for music.

98
00:09:08.434 --> 00:09:10.321
But you are good Marty.
You are really good.

99
00:09:10.346 --> 00:09:12.278
And this audition tape of yours
is great.

100
00:09:12.303 --> 00:09:14.311
You have got to send it in
to the record company.

101
00:09:14.523 --> 00:09:16.317
It's like Doc's always saying.
Yeah, I know, I know.

102
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.670
If you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

103
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.764
That's good advice Marty.

104
00:09:21.989 --> 00:09:23.466
Alright, ok Jennifer. What...

105
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.575
What if I send in the tape in
and they don't like it?

106
00:09:25.703 --> 00:09:27.280
I mean what if they say I am no good?

107
00:09:27.545 --> 00:09:30.113
What if they say. Get out of here kid,
you got no future?

108
00:09:30.114 --> 00:09:32.491
I mean I just don't think I can take
that kind of rejection.

109
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.377
Jesus, I am starting to sound
like my old man.

110
00:09:35.502 --> 00:09:36.874
Come on, he is not that bad.

111
00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:39.278
At least he is letting you
borrow the car tomorrow night.

112
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.249
Check out that 4x4.

113
00:09:43.851 --> 00:09:44.921
That is hot.

114
00:09:45.564 --> 00:09:46.820
Ok, back her up.

115
00:09:46.933 --> 00:09:48.132
Someday, Jennifer.

116
00:09:49.084 --> 00:09:50.070
Someday.

117
00:09:50.601 --> 00:09:51.415
Would not it be great,

118
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.679
to take that truck, up to the lake?

119
00:09:55.105 --> 00:09:57.500
Throw a couple of sleeping bags
in the back.

120
00:09:59.443 --> 00:10:01.303
Lie out underneath the stars.

121
00:10:01.596 --> 00:10:02.889
Stop it.
What?

122
00:10:04.156 --> 00:10:05.325
Does your mom know?

123
00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:06.700
About tomorrow night?

124
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.229
No, get out of town.

125
00:10:08.254 --> 00:10:10.229
My mom thinks I am going
camping with the guys.

126
00:10:10.913 --> 00:10:14.013
Look Jennifer, my mother would freak out
if she knew I was going with you.

127
00:10:14.038 --> 00:10:15.860
I would get the standard lecture about...

128
00:10:16.334 --> 00:10:19.404
how she never did that kind of stuff
when she was a kid. I mean look...

129
00:10:19.704 --> 00:10:21.131
I think the woman was born a nun.

130
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.704
She is just trying
to keep you respectable.

131
00:10:24.343 --> 00:10:26.270
She is not doing a very good job.

132
00:10:26.595 --> 00:10:27.646
Terrible.

133
00:10:27.796 --> 00:10:29.587
Save the clock tower!

134
00:10:29.942 --> 00:10:31.541
Save the clock tower!

135
00:10:31.642 --> 00:10:35.288
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring
an initiative to replace that clock.

136
00:10:35.771 --> 00:10:36.865
Thirty years ago,

137
00:10:36.866 --> 00:10:40.050
lightning struck that clock tower
and the clock has not run since.

138
00:10:40.276 --> 00:10:42.800
We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society

139
00:10:42.824 --> 00:10:45.072
think it should be preserved
exactly the way it is.

140
00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:47.112
As part of our history and heritage.

141
00:10:47.137 --> 00:10:48.449
Here we go lady.
There is a quarter.

142
00:10:48.474 --> 00:10:50.514
Thanks you.
Don't forget to take a flyer.

143
00:10:51.187 --> 00:10:53.105
Alright.
Save the clock tower!

144
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.090
Where were we?

145
00:10:57.334 --> 00:10:58.292
Right about here.

146
00:10:58.317 --> 00:10:59.128
Jennifer!

147
00:11:02.464 --> 00:11:03.466
It's my dad.
Right.

148
00:11:03.467 --> 00:11:04.467
I have got to go.

149
00:11:04.925 --> 00:11:06.176
I will call you tonight.

150
00:11:06.387 --> 00:11:07.638
I will be at my grandma's.

151
00:11:07.678 --> 00:11:09.378
Here, let me give you the number.

152
00:11:15.102 --> 00:11:15.717
Bye.

153
00:11:59.355 --> 00:12:02.258
<i>Bravo, Tango, Delta 6-2-9.</i>

154
00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:04.800
<i>Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.</i>

155
00:12:07.947 --> 00:12:08.806
Perfect.

156
00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:10.556
Just perfect.

157
00:12:16.997 --> 00:12:19.124
I can't believe,
you would loan me your car,

158
00:12:19.215 --> 00:12:21.238
without telling me it had a blind spot.

159
00:12:21.327 --> 00:12:22.612
Please listen...
I could have been killed.

160
00:12:23.128 --> 00:12:24.457
Now, now Biff know,

161
00:12:24.607 --> 00:12:25.778
I never noticed that,

162
00:12:25.802 --> 00:12:28.155
the car had any blind spot,

163
00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:29.552
before when I would drive it.

164
00:12:29.697 --> 00:12:30.815
Hi son.

165
00:12:31.136 --> 00:12:32.730
What, are you blind McFly?

166
00:12:33.013 --> 00:12:35.207
It's there. How else do you explain
that wreck out there?

167
00:12:35.508 --> 00:12:36.205
Biff...

168
00:12:36.554 --> 00:12:38.436
can I, can I assume...

169
00:12:38.811 --> 00:12:41.814
that your insurance is going to pay
for the damage?

170
00:12:41.897 --> 00:12:43.041
My insurance?

171
00:12:43.042 --> 00:12:44.191
It's your car.

172
00:12:44.316 --> 00:12:47.036
Your insurance should pay for.
I wanna know who is going to pay for this?

173
00:12:47.186 --> 00:12:49.262
I spilled beer all over it when the car
smashed into me.

174
00:12:49.263 --> 00:12:50.750
Who is gonna pay my cleaning bill?

175
00:12:51.448 --> 00:12:52.925
And where is my reports?

176
00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.265
Well I have not finished those up yet.

177
00:12:55.289 --> 00:12:57.771
You know I-I figured
since they were not due 'til...

178
00:12:57.796 --> 00:12:58.686
Hello?

179
00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:00.575
Hello, anybody home?

180
00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:02.740
Think McFly.
Alright.

181
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.676
Think!

182
00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:05.616
I got to have time to get
them retyped.

183
00:13:05.704 --> 00:13:07.246
But do you realize what would happen,

184
00:13:07.247 --> 00:13:09.717
if I hand in my reports in your handwriting?

185
00:13:10.191 --> 00:13:11.376
I will get fired.

186
00:13:11.773 --> 00:13:13.742
You would not want that to happen,
would you?

187
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.580
Would you?
Of course not Biff.

188
00:13:16.683 --> 00:13:18.426
No I would not want that to happen.

189
00:13:19.242 --> 00:13:22.486
Now look. I will finish those reports
tonight and I...

190
00:13:22.696 --> 00:13:24.889
run them on over first
thing tomorrow alright.

191
00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:26.929
Not too early, I sleep in Saturday.

192
00:13:26.954 --> 00:13:28.350
But why your shoe is untied.

193
00:13:29.452 --> 00:13:31.429
Don't be so gullible McFly.

194
00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:33.716
Got the place fixed up nice, though McFly.

195
00:13:36.076 --> 00:13:38.276
I have your car towed to your house,

196
00:13:38.287 --> 00:13:40.164
and all you got for me is lite beer?

197
00:13:47.705 --> 00:13:49.332
What are you looking at butthead?

198
00:13:52.155 --> 00:13:53.709
Say hi to your mom for me.

199
00:13:56.951 --> 00:13:58.743
I know what you are gonna say son.

200
00:13:59.144 --> 00:14:00.235
And you are right.

201
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.136
You are right.

202
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:03.821
But...

203
00:14:04.813 --> 00:14:07.499
Biff just happens to be my supervisor
and I am...

204
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.537
afraid I am just not very good
at confrontations.

205
00:14:12.738 --> 00:14:14.331
But the car Dad.

206
00:14:16.325 --> 00:14:18.702
I mean, he wrecked it.
He totaled it.

207
00:14:19.912 --> 00:14:21.956
I needed that car tomorrow night Dad.

208
00:14:21.981 --> 00:14:24.534
Do you have any idea how
important this was to me?

209
00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:25.458
Do you have any clue?

210
00:14:25.459 --> 00:14:27.603
I know and all I can say is I am...

211
00:14:28.671 --> 00:14:29.730
I am sorry.

212
00:14:30.422 --> 00:14:31.949
Believe me Marty,

213
00:14:32.174 --> 00:14:34.661
you are better off without having
to worry about all the...

214
00:14:34.912 --> 00:14:37.065
aggravation and headaches...

215
00:14:37.898 --> 00:14:39.198
playing at that dance.

216
00:14:39.223 --> 00:14:40.631
He is absolutely right Marty.

217
00:14:40.854 --> 00:14:42.247
The last thing you need...

218
00:14:42.388 --> 00:14:43.477
is headaches.

219
00:14:51.318 --> 00:14:52.318
Kids,

220
00:14:52.703 --> 00:14:55.105
we are going to have to eat
this cake by ourselves.

221
00:14:55.531 --> 00:14:57.708
Your Uncle Joey didn't make parole again.

222
00:15:00.286 --> 00:15:03.039
I think it would be nice
if you all dropped him a line.

223
00:15:03.706 --> 00:15:05.332
Uncle Jailbird Joey?

224
00:15:05.457 --> 00:15:07.001
He is your brother, Mom.

225
00:15:07.026 --> 00:15:10.780
Yeah. It's a major embarrassment,
having an uncle in prison.

226
00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:13.215
We all make mistakes in life children.

227
00:15:13.299 --> 00:15:14.842
Goddamn it.
I am late.

228
00:15:15.036 --> 00:15:16.563
David, watch your mouth!

229
00:15:16.844 --> 00:15:19.188
Come here and kiss your mother
before you go.

230
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:20.900
Come here.
Come on Mom make it fast.

231
00:15:21.555 --> 00:15:22.555
I will miss my bus.

232
00:15:23.058 --> 00:15:24.226
See you later Pop.

233
00:15:25.477 --> 00:15:26.954
Time to change that oil.

234
00:15:30.524 --> 00:15:31.525
Hey Marty.

235
00:15:32.276 --> 00:15:34.174
I am not your answering service.

236
00:15:34.198 --> 00:15:36.530
While you were outside
pouting over the car.

237
00:15:36.655 --> 00:15:38.608
Jennifer Parker called you twice.

238
00:15:38.758 --> 00:15:40.301
I don't like her Marty.

239
00:15:40.326 --> 00:15:43.585
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

240
00:15:43.704 --> 00:15:46.358
Mom, there is nothing wrong
with calling a boy.

241
00:15:46.665 --> 00:15:48.114
I think it's terrible.

242
00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.199
Girls chasing boys.

243
00:15:50.586 --> 00:15:53.723
When I was your age,
I never chased a boy or called a boy.

244
00:15:54.006 --> 00:15:56.550
Or sat in a parked car with a boy.

245
00:15:57.108 --> 00:15:59.535
Then how am I ever supposed
to meet anybody?

246
00:16:00.763 --> 00:16:02.729
Well, it will just happen.

247
00:16:03.265 --> 00:16:04.916
Like the way I met your father.

248
00:16:05.684 --> 00:16:08.471
That was so stupid.
Grandpa hit him with the car.

249
00:16:09.104 --> 00:16:10.564
It was meant to be.

250
00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:12.596
Anyway...

251
00:16:13.567 --> 00:16:15.132
if Grandpa had not hit him,

252
00:16:15.156 --> 00:16:16.987
then none of you would have been born.

253
00:16:17.012 --> 00:16:18.197
Yeah, well...

254
00:16:18.739 --> 00:16:22.159
I still don't understand what Dad was
doing in the middle of the street.

255
00:16:22.184 --> 00:16:23.450
What was it, George?

256
00:16:23.551 --> 00:16:24.745
Bird-watching?

257
00:16:24.828 --> 00:16:25.794
What Lorraine?

258
00:16:26.059 --> 00:16:26.930
What?

259
00:16:27.456 --> 00:16:29.469
Anyway, your Grandpa hit him
with the car...

260
00:16:30.459 --> 00:16:32.286
and brought him into the house.

261
00:16:33.545 --> 00:16:35.422
He seemed so helpless.

262
00:16:38.217 --> 00:16:39.677
Like a little lost puppy,

263
00:16:39.777 --> 00:16:41.278
and my heart just went out to him.

264
00:16:41.303 --> 00:16:44.473
Yea, Mom, we know.
You have told us this story a million times.

265
00:16:44.474 --> 00:16:45.775
You felt sorry for him.

266
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.414
So you decided to go with him,

267
00:16:47.438 --> 00:16:49.166
to the Fish Under the Sea dance.

268
00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:52.094
No, no. It was the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

269
00:16:53.148 --> 00:16:54.379
Our first date.

270
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.335
I will never forget it.

271
00:16:56.735 --> 00:16:59.406
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember George?

272
00:17:03.075 --> 00:17:06.662
Your father kissed me
for the first time on that dance floor.

273
00:17:08.749 --> 00:17:10.376
It was then that I realized...

274
00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:13.558
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

275
00:17:17.784 --> 00:17:18.883
Oh, no.

276
00:17:43.073 --> 00:17:44.073
Hello.

277
00:17:44.103 --> 00:17:45.597
<i>Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?</i>

278
00:17:45.621 --> 00:17:46.737
No I... Doc.

279
00:17:48.273 --> 00:17:49.017
No.

280
00:17:49.228 --> 00:17:50.671
No, don't, don't be silly.

281
00:17:51.123 --> 00:17:52.604
<i>Listen, this is very important.</i>

282
00:17:52.628 --> 00:17:54.001
<i>I forgot my video camera.</i>

283
00:17:54.026 --> 00:17:56.357
<i>Can you stop by my place and pick
it up on your way to the mall?</i>

284
00:17:56.871 --> 00:17:57.868
Yeah.

285
00:17:58.174 --> 00:17:59.845
I am... I am on my way.

286
00:18:23.948 --> 00:18:25.037
Einstein!

287
00:18:25.138 --> 00:18:26.869
Hey Einstein!
Where is the doc, boy?

288
00:19:20.897 --> 00:19:21.697
Doc!

289
00:19:23.316 --> 00:19:23.984
Marty!

290
00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:25.395
You made it!
Yeah.

291
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.314
Welcome to my latest experiment.

292
00:19:27.315 --> 00:19:29.639
This is the big one, the one
I have been waiting for all my life.

293
00:19:30.323 --> 00:19:31.542
Well, it's a DeLorean, right?

294
00:19:31.567 --> 00:19:33.401
Bear with me Marty.
All your questions will be answered.

295
00:19:33.426 --> 00:19:35.034
Roll tape and we will proceed.

296
00:19:35.037 --> 00:19:36.594
Oh Doc?
Is that a Devo suit?

297
00:19:36.595 --> 00:19:38.927
Never mind, never mind that now.
Not now. Not now.

298
00:19:39.791 --> 00:19:40.716
Alright, I am ready.

299
00:19:41.132 --> 00:19:41.875
Good evening.

300
00:19:41.986 --> 00:19:43.056
I am Dr. Emmett Brown.

301
00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:45.149
I am standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.

302
00:19:45.244 --> 00:19:48.631
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.

303
00:19:49.008 --> 00:19:50.719
And this is temporal experiment
number one.

304
00:19:51.312 --> 00:19:52.341
Come on, Einie.

305
00:19:52.366 --> 00:19:53.450
Hey, hey, boy, get in there.

306
00:19:53.475 --> 00:19:54.341
That a boy!

307
00:19:54.434 --> 00:19:55.683
In you go. Sit down.

308
00:19:56.473 --> 00:19:58.217
Put your seat belt on.
That's it.

309
00:20:04.282 --> 00:20:05.027
Ok.

310
00:20:07.093 --> 00:20:08.021
Please note...

311
00:20:08.804 --> 00:20:09.876
that Einstein's clock,

312
00:20:09.901 --> 00:20:12.321
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

313
00:20:12.949 --> 00:20:14.359
Got it?
Right. Check Doc.

314
00:20:14.384 --> 00:20:15.084
Good.

315
00:20:17.745 --> 00:20:18.832
Have a good trip Einstein.

316
00:20:19.257 --> 00:20:20.257
Watch your head.

317
00:20:26.379 --> 00:20:28.058
You got that thing hooked up to the...

318
00:20:28.223 --> 00:20:28.906
car?

319
00:20:28.931 --> 00:20:30.792
Watch this.
Yeah. Ok.

320
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:31.988
Got it.

321
00:20:36.472 --> 00:20:37.434
Jesus!

322
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.043
Not me! The car! The car!

323
00:21:01.539 --> 00:21:03.400
If my calculations are correct...

324
00:21:04.375 --> 00:21:06.603
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour...

325
00:21:07.461 --> 00:21:09.439
you are going to see some serious shit.

326
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.010
Watch this!
Watch this!

327
00:22:05.311 --> 00:22:07.105
What did I tell you?

328
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:11.150
88 miles per hour!

329
00:22:14.278 --> 00:22:19.199
The temporal displacement occurred
exactly 1:20 a.m and 0 seconds!

330
00:22:20.952 --> 00:22:22.512
Ah Jesus Christ!

331
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.389
Jesus Christ Doc!
You disintegrated Einstein!

332
00:22:25.414 --> 00:22:27.759
Calm down Marty.
I didn't disintegrate anything.

333
00:22:28.125 --> 00:22:30.148
The molecular structure of both Einstein

334
00:22:30.172 --> 00:22:32.238
and the car are completely intact.

335
00:22:32.922 --> 00:22:34.298
Then where the hell are they?

336
00:22:34.323 --> 00:22:35.809
The appropriate question is...

337
00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:37.444
When the hell are they?

338
00:22:37.593 --> 00:22:42.056
You see, Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

339
00:22:42.557 --> 00:22:45.376
I sent him into the future.

340
00:22:46.227 --> 00:22:48.504
One minute into the future, to be exact.

341
00:22:48.688 --> 00:22:49.835
At precisely,

342
00:22:49.904 --> 00:22:51.903
1:21 a.m and 0 seconds,

343
00:22:51.928 --> 00:22:54.530
we shall catch up with him
and the time machine.

344
00:22:58.225 --> 00:22:59.038
Wait a minute.

345
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.366
Wait a minute, Doc?

346
00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:01.403
Are...

347
00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:04.279
are you telling me,
you built a time machine...

348
00:23:06.164 --> 00:23:07.324
out of a DeLorean?

349
00:23:07.325 --> 00:23:08.374
The way I see it...

350
00:23:08.499 --> 00:23:10.439
if you are going to build a time machine
into a car,

351
00:23:10.463 --> 00:23:11.945
why not do it with style?

352
00:23:12.277 --> 00:23:13.113
Besides,

353
00:23:13.215 --> 00:23:15.709
the stainless-steel construction
made the flux dispersal...

354
00:23:17.175 --> 00:23:17.749
Look out!

355
00:24:03.421 --> 00:24:04.546
What? What? Is it hot?

356
00:24:04.754 --> 00:24:06.463
It's cold. Damn cold.

357
00:24:09.802 --> 00:24:12.013
Einstein, you little devil!

358
00:24:14.224 --> 00:24:17.773
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute
behind mine and still ticking!

359
00:24:21.606 --> 00:24:23.191
He is alright.
He is fine.

360
00:24:23.333 --> 00:24:25.627
He is completely unaware
that anything happened.

361
00:24:25.652 --> 00:24:28.321
As far as he is concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

362
00:24:28.404 --> 00:24:30.932
That's why his watch is
exactly one minute behind mine.

363
00:24:30.998 --> 00:24:34.052
He skipped over that minute to instantly
arrive at this moment in time.

364
00:24:34.123 --> 00:24:34.922
Come here.

365
00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:36.697
I will show you how it works.
Alright.

366
00:24:38.915 --> 00:24:39.767
First,

367
00:24:40.013 --> 00:24:41.569
you turn the time circuits on.

368
00:24:45.663 --> 00:24:46.997
This readout tells
you where you are going.

369
00:24:47.022 --> 00:24:48.349
This one tells you where you are.

370
00:24:48.374 --> 00:24:49.758
This one tells you where you were.

371
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.403
You input your destination time
on this keypad.

372
00:24:52.428 --> 00:24:55.115
Say you want to see the signing
of the Declaration of Independence.

373
00:24:58.101 --> 00:24:59.677
Or witness the birth of Christ.

374
00:25:03.147 --> 00:25:04.336
Here is a red-letter date,

375
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.659
in the history of science.

376
00:25:05.942 --> 00:25:08.695
November 5, 1955.

377
00:25:12.448 --> 00:25:13.950
Yes, of course.

378
00:25:13.975 --> 00:25:16.837
November 5, 1955.

379
00:25:17.662 --> 00:25:19.155
Why? I don't get it.
Ok, what happened?

380
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.601
That was the day I invented time travel.

381
00:25:23.334 --> 00:25:24.578
I remember it vividly.

382
00:25:24.961 --> 00:25:27.005
I was standing on the edge of
my toilet, hanging a clock.

383
00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.766
The porcelain was wet.
I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink.

384
00:25:29.882 --> 00:25:31.759
And when I came to, I had a revelation.

385
00:25:31.901 --> 00:25:32.781
A vision.

386
00:25:32.937 --> 00:25:34.133
A picture in my head.

387
00:25:34.512 --> 00:25:35.709
A picture of this.

388
00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.650
This is what makes time travel possible.

389
00:25:39.392 --> 00:25:40.886
The flux capacitor.

390
00:25:41.477 --> 00:25:42.645
Flux capacitor?

391
00:25:42.723 --> 00:25:44.835
It's taken almost 30 years
and my entire family

392
00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:46.753
fortune to realize the vision of that day.

393
00:25:47.817 --> 00:25:49.928
My God, has it been that long?

394
00:25:50.737 --> 00:25:52.552
Things have certainly changed
around here.

395
00:25:54.532 --> 00:25:57.969
I remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see.

396
00:25:59.871 --> 00:26:00.976
Old man Peabody,

397
00:26:01.281 --> 00:26:02.558
owned all of this.

398
00:26:03.426 --> 00:26:04.897
He had this crazy idea,

399
00:26:05.498 --> 00:26:07.183
about breeding pine trees.

400
00:26:11.299 --> 00:26:12.250
This is...

401
00:26:12.425 --> 00:26:14.519
This is heavy-duty Doc.
This is great.

402
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.564
Does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

403
00:26:17.756 --> 00:26:20.386
Unfortunately no. It requires
something with a little more kick.

404
00:26:20.563 --> 00:26:21.563
Plutonium.

405
00:26:21.697 --> 00:26:22.695
Ah plutonium.

406
00:26:22.719 --> 00:26:23.753
Wait a minute.
Are you...

407
00:26:24.121 --> 00:26:26.339
Are you telling me, this sucker is nuclear?

408
00:26:26.488 --> 00:26:28.525
Hey, hey, hey! Keep rolling.
Keep rolling there.

409
00:26:28.613 --> 00:26:30.306
No, no, no, no.
This sucker is electrical.

410
00:26:30.527 --> 00:26:34.348
But I need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.

411
00:26:34.373 --> 00:26:37.700
Doc, you don't just walk into a store
and buy plutonium.

412
00:26:38.535 --> 00:26:39.795
Did you rip that off?

413
00:26:42.184 --> 00:26:43.060
Of course.

414
00:26:43.084 --> 00:26:44.851
From a group of Libyan Nationalists.

415
00:26:44.976 --> 00:26:46.214
They wanted me to build them a bomb.

416
00:26:46.334 --> 00:26:48.470
So, I took their plutonium and in
turn gave them a shoddy bomb,

417
00:26:48.495 --> 00:26:50.544
casing full of used pinball machine parts.

418
00:26:50.588 --> 00:26:52.708
Come on. Let's get you a radiation suit.
Jesus!

419
00:26:52.839 --> 00:26:53.839
We must prepare to reload.

420
00:27:23.193 --> 00:27:25.221
It's safe now.
Everything is lead-lined.

421
00:27:27.622 --> 00:27:29.082
Don't lose those tapes now.

422
00:27:29.752 --> 00:27:31.513
I need that, as a record.

423
00:27:31.796 --> 00:27:33.590
Let's put this back here.
There we go.

424
00:27:36.751 --> 00:27:38.061
Almost forgot my luggage.

425
00:27:38.428 --> 00:27:40.787
Who knows if they got
cotton underwear in the future.

426
00:27:41.264 --> 00:27:42.725
I am allergic to all synthetics poducts.

427
00:27:42.975 --> 00:27:44.099
The future?

428
00:27:44.517 --> 00:27:46.178
That's where you are going.
That's right.

429
00:27:46.436 --> 00:27:47.715
25 years in the future.

430
00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.440
I have always dreamed of seeing
the future, looking beyond my years,

431
00:27:50.727 --> 00:27:52.308
seeing the progress of mankind.

432
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.010
Why not?

433
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.120
I will also be able to see
who wins the next 25 World Series.

434
00:27:58.573 --> 00:27:59.374
Doc.

435
00:28:00.992 --> 00:28:03.169
Look me up, when you get there.

436
00:28:04.057 --> 00:28:05.101
Indeed I will.

437
00:28:05.624 --> 00:28:06.624
Roll them.

438
00:28:13.004 --> 00:28:13.734
I...

439
00:28:14.257 --> 00:28:15.600
Dr. Emmett Brown...

440
00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.719
am about to embark on an historic journey.

441
00:28:21.846 --> 00:28:23.581
What am I thinking of?

442
00:28:23.618 --> 00:28:25.863
I almost forgot to bring extra plutonium.

443
00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:28.603
How do I expect to get back?
One pellet, one trip.

444
00:28:28.628 --> 00:28:30.072
I must be out of my mind.

445
00:28:33.274 --> 00:28:34.301
What is it Einie?

446
00:28:43.409 --> 00:28:44.494
Oh, my God.

447
00:28:45.036 --> 00:28:47.085
They found me. I don't know how,
but they found me.

448
00:28:47.914 --> 00:28:49.019
Run for it Marty!

449
00:28:49.136 --> 00:28:50.218
Who? Who?

450
00:28:50.583 --> 00:28:52.694
Who do you think?
The Libyans!

451
00:28:56.297 --> 00:28:57.540
Holy shit!

452
00:29:01.844 --> 00:29:03.271
I will draw their fire!

453
00:29:11.646 --> 00:29:12.722
Doc, wait!

454
00:29:27.287 --> 00:29:29.380
No!

455
00:29:29.563 --> 00:29:31.057
You bastard!

456
00:29:49.893 --> 00:29:50.893
Go!

457
00:29:51.468 --> 00:29:52.846
Damn Soviet gun.

458
00:29:57.317 --> 00:29:58.317
Go!

459
00:30:39.128 --> 00:30:40.338
Come on, move.

460
00:30:40.854 --> 00:30:41.645
Dammit!

461
00:30:42.846 --> 00:30:43.754
Jesus!

462
00:31:04.467 --> 00:31:05.727
Holy shit!

463
00:31:06.678 --> 00:31:08.924
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

464
00:32:01.191 --> 00:32:02.097
What is it?

465
00:32:02.734 --> 00:32:03.794
What is it Pa?

466
00:32:04.277 --> 00:32:05.757
Looks like an airplane,

467
00:32:06.386 --> 00:32:07.761
without wings.

468
00:32:08.114 --> 00:32:09.772
That ain't no airplane.

469
00:32:10.073 --> 00:32:11.101
Look.

470
00:32:32.013 --> 00:32:33.013
Don't look!

471
00:32:33.473 --> 00:32:34.273
Listen, look...

472
00:32:47.362 --> 00:32:48.216
Hello.

473
00:32:51.699 --> 00:32:52.699
Excuse me.

474
00:32:56.496 --> 00:32:57.784
Sorry about your barn.

475
00:33:01.101 --> 00:33:04.354
It's already mutated into human form,
shoot it!

476
00:33:06.714 --> 00:33:09.092
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!

477
00:33:13.471 --> 00:33:14.471
Wait!

478
00:33:17.141 --> 00:33:18.626
Shoot it Pa!

479
00:33:21.145 --> 00:33:22.478
My pine!

480
00:33:22.479 --> 00:33:24.048
Why you...

481
00:33:26.234 --> 00:33:27.746
You space bastard!

482
00:33:28.008 --> 00:33:29.480
You killed our pine!

483
00:33:34.033 --> 00:33:35.610
Alright. Alright.
Ok McFly.

484
00:33:35.994 --> 00:33:38.204
Get a grip on yourself.
It's all a dream.

485
00:33:38.374 --> 00:33:41.210
It's just a very intense dream.

486
00:34:24.125 --> 00:34:25.563
Listen, you got to help me.

487
00:34:25.587 --> 00:34:27.295
Don't stop Wilbur! Don't!

488
00:34:29.945 --> 00:34:30.843
It can't be.

489
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:38.500
This is nuts.

490
00:34:43.186 --> 00:34:43.937
Come on.

491
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.269
Perfect.

492
00:36:41.004 --> 00:36:44.725
<i>Remember, fellow citizens,
the future is in your hands.</i>

493
00:36:45.008 --> 00:36:48.679
<i>If you believe in progress,
re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.</i>

494
00:36:48.887 --> 00:36:50.931
<i>Progress is his middle name.</i>

495
00:36:51.056 --> 00:36:53.500
<i>Mayor Red Thomas' progress platform,</i>

496
00:36:53.616 --> 00:36:56.076
<i>means more jobs, better education,</i>

497
00:36:56.311 --> 00:36:58.998
<i>bigger civic improvements
and lower taxes.</i>

498
00:36:59.481 --> 00:37:00.586
<i>On election day,</i>

499
00:37:00.611 --> 00:37:03.041
<i>cast your vote for a proven leader.</i>

500
00:37:03.277 --> 00:37:05.271
<i>Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.</i>

501
00:37:08.907 --> 00:37:10.368
This has got to be a dream.

502
00:37:27.885 --> 00:37:30.012
Hey kid.
What you do, you jump ship?

503
00:37:30.929 --> 00:37:31.561
What?

504
00:37:31.796 --> 00:37:33.468
What's with the life preserver?

505
00:37:38.645 --> 00:37:39.933
I want to use the phone.

506
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.027
It's in the back.

507
00:37:45.152 --> 00:37:45.925
Brown.

508
00:37:48.663 --> 00:37:50.252
Great.
You are alive.

509
00:38:02.252 --> 00:38:03.370
Come on.

510
00:38:11.011 --> 00:38:14.857
Do you know where 1640 Riverside...
You gonna order something kid?

511
00:38:17.017 --> 00:38:17.845
Yeah.

512
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:19.670
Give me...
Give me a Tab.

513
00:38:20.437 --> 00:38:22.598
Tab? I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

514
00:38:22.882 --> 00:38:24.359
Right. Give me a Pepsi Free.

515
00:38:24.929 --> 00:38:27.040
You want a Pepsi pal,
you are going to pay for it.

516
00:38:27.945 --> 00:38:30.431
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, ok?

517
00:38:31.068 --> 00:38:32.361
Something without sugar.

518
00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:41.619
Hey McFly.

519
00:38:44.503 --> 00:38:45.708
What do you think you are doing?

520
00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:47.708
Biff.

521
00:38:48.424 --> 00:38:50.884
Hey I am talking to you McFly,
you Irish bug!

522
00:38:51.323 --> 00:38:53.390
Hey Biff, hey Guys.
How are you doing?

523
00:38:53.415 --> 00:38:54.815
You got my homework finished McFly?

524
00:38:55.637 --> 00:38:58.409
Well actually, I figured since it
was not due 'til Monday...

525
00:38:58.434 --> 00:39:00.013
Hello? Hello?

526
00:39:00.114 --> 00:39:01.170
Anybody home?

527
00:39:01.171 --> 00:39:02.944
Hey think McFly.

528
00:39:02.945 --> 00:39:03.689
Think!

529
00:39:03.772 --> 00:39:05.549
I got to have time to recopy it.

530
00:39:05.733 --> 00:39:09.186
You realize what would happen if I hand in
my homework in your handwriting?

531
00:39:09.437 --> 00:39:10.947
I will get kicked out of school.

532
00:39:11.405 --> 00:39:13.449
You would not want that to happen,
would you?

533
00:39:16.118 --> 00:39:17.828
Would you?
Now, of course not Biff.

534
00:39:17.853 --> 00:39:19.330
No.
I would not want that to happen.

535
00:39:19.955 --> 00:39:21.341
What are you looking at, butthead?

536
00:39:21.519 --> 00:39:23.378
Biff, get a load of this guy is life preserver.

537
00:39:24.001 --> 00:39:25.766
Dork thinks he is going to drown.
Yeah.

538
00:39:25.791 --> 00:39:27.368
How about my homework McFly?

539
00:39:28.797 --> 00:39:30.124
Ok Biff. Well...

540
00:39:30.591 --> 00:39:32.697
I will finish that up tonight and then...

541
00:39:32.722 --> 00:39:35.235
I will bring it over first thing
tomorrow morning.

542
00:39:35.554 --> 00:39:38.558
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.
Oh McFly, your shoe is untied!

543
00:39:39.683 --> 00:39:41.727
Don't be so gullible McFly.
Ok.

544
00:39:41.752 --> 00:39:42.869
I don't want to see you in
here again.

545
00:39:42.894 --> 00:39:44.892
Ok. Alright. Bye-bye.

546
00:40:07.417 --> 00:40:08.269
What?

547
00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.878
You are George McFly!

548
00:40:10.299 --> 00:40:11.599
Yeah. Who are you?

549
00:40:11.733 --> 00:40:14.956
Say! Why do you let those boys
push you around like that for?

550
00:40:14.981 --> 00:40:16.471
Well, they are bigger than me.

551
00:40:16.496 --> 00:40:19.143
Stand tall boy.
Have some respect for yourself.

552
00:40:19.222 --> 00:40:21.468
Don't you know,
if you let people walk over you now,

553
00:40:21.493 --> 00:40:23.493
they will be walking over you
for the rest of your life.

554
00:40:23.518 --> 00:40:24.388
Look at me.

555
00:40:24.559 --> 00:40:26.916
You think I am gonna spend
the rest of my life in this slop house?

556
00:40:26.941 --> 00:40:28.735
Watch it Goldie.
No sir!

557
00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.418
I am gonna make something of myself.
I am going to night school,

558
00:40:31.443 --> 00:40:33.531
and one day, I am going
to be somebody.

559
00:40:33.556 --> 00:40:35.133
That's right.
He is going to be mayor.

560
00:40:35.509 --> 00:40:36.586
Yeah I am...

561
00:40:37.741 --> 00:40:39.118
Mayor!

562
00:40:39.868 --> 00:40:41.932
Now that's a good idea!

563
00:40:41.956 --> 00:40:43.789
I could run for mayor.

564
00:40:43.814 --> 00:40:45.426
A colored mayor.
That will be the day.

565
00:40:45.451 --> 00:40:47.784
You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers.
I will be mayor.

566
00:40:47.809 --> 00:40:50.187
I will be the most powerful man
in Hill Valley,

567
00:40:50.212 --> 00:40:52.081
and I am going to clean up this town.

568
00:40:52.106 --> 00:40:54.333
Good.
You can start by sweeping the floor.

569
00:40:57.636 --> 00:40:59.363
Mayor Goldie Wilson.

570
00:40:59.847 --> 00:41:01.724
I like the sound of that.

571
00:41:14.278 --> 00:41:15.879
Hey, Dad! George!

572
00:41:16.092 --> 00:41:17.698
Hey, you on the bike!

573
00:41:48.979 --> 00:41:50.596
He is a peeping Tom!

574
00:41:56.515 --> 00:41:57.455
Dad!

575
00:42:09.605 --> 00:42:10.305
Hey wait.

576
00:42:10.584 --> 00:42:12.295
Wait a minute.
Who are you?

577
00:42:14.588 --> 00:42:15.384
Stella!

578
00:42:16.009 --> 00:42:18.809
Another one of these damn kids
jumped in front of my car!

579
00:42:19.885 --> 00:42:21.954
Come out here!
Help me take him in the house!

580
00:42:27.653 --> 00:42:28.520
Mom?

581
00:42:29.428 --> 00:42:30.335
That you?

582
00:42:31.414 --> 00:42:32.421
There now.

583
00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.226
Just relax.

584
00:42:36.828 --> 00:42:39.498
You have been asleep
for almost nine hours now.

585
00:42:41.818 --> 00:42:42.544
I had a...

586
00:42:42.982 --> 00:42:44.359
horrible nightmare.

587
00:42:45.361 --> 00:42:46.340
I dreamed that I went...

588
00:42:47.015 --> 00:42:48.347
back in time.

589
00:42:48.819 --> 00:42:50.031
It was terrible.

590
00:42:50.991 --> 00:42:51.770
Well...

591
00:42:52.805 --> 00:42:56.247
you are safe and sound now
back in good old 1955.

592
00:42:57.456 --> 00:42:58.874
1955?

593
00:43:03.671 --> 00:43:04.698
You are my...

594
00:43:05.074 --> 00:43:06.097
You are my...

595
00:43:06.507 --> 00:43:07.697
My name is Lorraine.

596
00:43:08.676 --> 00:43:10.182
Lorraine Baines?

597
00:43:10.548 --> 00:43:11.400
Yeah.

598
00:43:12.638 --> 00:43:13.881
But you are...

599
00:43:14.265 --> 00:43:15.327
Just so...

600
00:43:15.787 --> 00:43:16.624
You are so...

601
00:43:18.296 --> 00:43:19.172
Thin!

602
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.156
Just relax Calvin.
You got a big bruise on your head.

603
00:43:26.819 --> 00:43:27.920
Where are my pants?

604
00:43:28.779 --> 00:43:29.670
Over there.

605
00:43:30.713 --> 00:43:31.940
On my hope chest.

606
00:43:33.868 --> 00:43:36.404
I have never seen purple
underwear before Calvin.

607
00:43:37.079 --> 00:43:39.882
Calvin? Why-why do you keep
calling me Calvin?

608
00:43:40.166 --> 00:43:41.437
That is your name, isn't it?

609
00:43:41.694 --> 00:43:42.974
Calvin Klein.

610
00:43:43.419 --> 00:43:45.513
It's written all over your underwear.

611
00:43:46.672 --> 00:43:48.449
I guess they call you Cal?

612
00:43:49.347 --> 00:43:50.740
No actually people...

613
00:43:51.833 --> 00:43:52.977
call me Marty.

614
00:43:55.222 --> 00:43:56.844
Pleased to meet you Calvin.

615
00:43:58.559 --> 00:43:59.559
Marty.

616
00:44:01.353 --> 00:44:02.353
Klein.

617
00:44:09.361 --> 00:44:10.623
Do you mind if I sit here?

618
00:44:11.396 --> 00:44:12.615
No. Fine.

619
00:44:12.782 --> 00:44:14.302
No. Good. Fine.

620
00:44:14.473 --> 00:44:15.153
Good.

621
00:44:17.161 --> 00:44:19.261
That's a big bruise you have there.

622
00:44:21.229 --> 00:44:23.323
Lorraine, are you up there?

623
00:44:23.501 --> 00:44:24.977
Oh, my God!
It's my mother!

624
00:44:25.544 --> 00:44:26.368
Quick!

625
00:44:27.016 --> 00:44:28.439
Put your pants back on!

626
00:44:36.806 --> 00:44:38.900
So, tell me Marty,
how long have you been in port?

627
00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:41.744
Excuse me?
I guessed you are a sailor.

628
00:44:41.769 --> 00:44:43.730
That's why you wear that life preserver.

629
00:44:44.355 --> 00:44:45.531
Coast guard.

630
00:44:45.619 --> 00:44:46.444
Sam,

631
00:44:46.785 --> 00:44:49.094
here is the young man you hit
with your car out there.

632
00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:50.476
He is alright.
Thank God.

633
00:44:50.477 --> 00:44:52.630
What were you doing in the middle
of the street, a kid your age?

634
00:44:52.655 --> 00:44:54.618
Don't pay attention to him.
He is in one of his moods.

635
00:44:54.643 --> 00:44:57.501
Sam, you quit fiddling with that thing.
Come in here to dinner.

636
00:44:57.758 --> 00:44:59.535
Now let's see.
You already know Lorraine.

637
00:44:59.883 --> 00:45:02.382
This is Milton, this is Sally...

638
00:45:02.498 --> 00:45:03.769
that's Toby,

639
00:45:03.793 --> 00:45:06.510
and over there
in the playpen is little baby Joey.

640
00:45:08.712 --> 00:45:10.373
So, you are my uncle Joey.

641
00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:13.568
Better get used to these bars kid.

642
00:45:14.093 --> 00:45:18.205
Yes. Joey just loves being in his playpen.

643
00:45:18.431 --> 00:45:21.817
He cries whenever we take him out,
so we leave him in there all the time.

644
00:45:22.056 --> 00:45:24.433
Well, Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

645
00:45:24.458 --> 00:45:26.228
Well listen, I really ought to...

646
00:45:26.587 --> 00:45:27.731
Sit here Marty.

647
00:45:28.524 --> 00:45:32.413
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing
and come in here and eat your dinner.

648
00:45:34.699 --> 00:45:36.210
Look at it roll.

649
00:45:36.574 --> 00:45:38.977
Now we can watch
Jackie Gleason while we eat.

650
00:45:47.668 --> 00:45:49.116
Our first television set.

651
00:45:49.323 --> 00:45:50.895
Dad just picked it up today.

652
00:45:51.964 --> 00:45:53.191
Do you have a television?

653
00:45:54.024 --> 00:45:55.404
Yeah, you know we have...

654
00:45:55.833 --> 00:45:56.941
two of them.

655
00:45:58.324 --> 00:45:59.691
You must be rich.

656
00:45:59.972 --> 00:46:03.935
Oh honey, he is teasing you.
Nobody has two television sets.

657
00:46:08.823 --> 00:46:09.536
Hey.

658
00:46:10.107 --> 00:46:13.027
Hey. I have seen this one.
I have seen this one, this is a classic.

659
00:46:13.052 --> 00:46:15.655
This is where Ralph dresses up
as a man from space.

660
00:46:16.363 --> 00:46:17.794
What do you mean, you have seen this?

661
00:46:18.207 --> 00:46:19.433
It's brand-new.

662
00:46:19.867 --> 00:46:21.013
Yeah, well, I saw it on a...

663
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.498
rerun.

664
00:46:22.953 --> 00:46:23.924
What's a rerun?

665
00:46:24.872 --> 00:46:26.033
You will find out.

666
00:46:26.457 --> 00:46:28.952
You know Marty, you look so familiar to me.

667
00:46:28.977 --> 00:46:30.537
Do I know your mother?

668
00:46:32.046 --> 00:46:33.806
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

669
00:46:34.173 --> 00:46:37.367
Oh, then I want to give her a call.
I don't want her to worry about you.

670
00:46:37.392 --> 00:46:38.460
You can't.

671
00:46:39.828 --> 00:46:41.557
That is, nobody here...

672
00:46:42.158 --> 00:46:43.124
nobody home.

673
00:46:45.726 --> 00:46:46.507
Yet.

674
00:46:49.471 --> 00:46:50.339
Listen.

675
00:46:50.564 --> 00:46:53.009
Do you... Do you know where
Riverside Drive is?

676
00:46:53.234 --> 00:46:55.673
It's on the other end of town.
A block past Maple.

677
00:46:55.774 --> 00:46:56.854
East end of town.

678
00:46:57.395 --> 00:46:58.829
Wait a minute, a block past Maple.

679
00:46:58.854 --> 00:47:01.156
That's John F. Kennedy Drive.

680
00:47:02.284 --> 00:47:03.925
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

681
00:47:04.229 --> 00:47:05.198
Mother?

682
00:47:06.288 --> 00:47:08.716
With Marty's parents out of town,

683
00:47:09.458 --> 00:47:11.531
don't you think he ought
to spend the night?

684
00:47:11.961 --> 00:47:14.238
I mean after all,
Dad almost killed him with the car.

685
00:47:14.463 --> 00:47:16.024
That's true Marty.

686
00:47:16.632 --> 00:47:18.379
I think maybe you should spend the night.

687
00:47:18.403 --> 00:47:20.114
I think you are our responsibility.

688
00:47:20.139 --> 00:47:21.484
Well, gee, I don't know.

689
00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:23.448
He can sleep in my room.

690
00:47:24.181 --> 00:47:26.082
I got to go!
I got to go!

691
00:47:26.132 --> 00:47:28.470
Thanks very much, it was wonderful.
You were all great...

692
00:47:28.695 --> 00:47:29.695
See you all later.

693
00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.020
Too much later.

694
00:47:36.485 --> 00:47:38.813
He is a very strange young man.

695
00:47:39.193 --> 00:47:40.269
He is an idiot.

696
00:47:40.823 --> 00:47:42.040
Comes from upbringing.

697
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:43.798
His parents are probably idiots too.

698
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:47.681
Lorraine, you ever have a kid
who acts that way, I will disown you.

699
00:48:26.377 --> 00:48:27.183
Doc?

700
00:48:28.222 --> 00:48:29.176
Don't say a word.

701
00:48:30.449 --> 00:48:31.138
Doc.

702
00:48:31.163 --> 00:48:32.284
I don't wanna know your name.

703
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:33.634
I don't want to know anything
bout you.

704
00:48:33.659 --> 00:48:34.559
Listen Doc...
Quiet!

705
00:48:34.729 --> 00:48:35.417
Doc.

706
00:48:35.418 --> 00:48:36.918
Doc, it's me Marty.
Don't tell me anything.

707
00:48:37.003 --> 00:48:38.026
Doc, you got to help...
Quiet.

708
00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:38.770
Quiet.

709
00:48:41.924 --> 00:48:43.526
I am going to read your thoughts.

710
00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:45.958
Let's see now. You have come here...

711
00:48:46.041 --> 00:48:47.655
from a great distance?

712
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.805
Yeah.
Exactly.

713
00:48:48.806 --> 00:48:49.815
Don't tell me!

714
00:48:50.683 --> 00:48:53.518
You want me to buy a subscription
to the Saturday Evening Post.

715
00:48:53.603 --> 00:48:54.215
No.

716
00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.023
Not a word. Not a word.
Not a word now!

717
00:48:56.272 --> 00:48:57.072
Quiet.

718
00:48:59.515 --> 00:49:00.560
Donations.

719
00:49:01.123 --> 00:49:02.562
You want me to make a donation...

720
00:49:03.279 --> 00:49:05.530
to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.

721
00:49:06.115 --> 00:49:06.900
Doc.

722
00:49:09.035 --> 00:49:10.233
I am from the future.

723
00:49:11.245 --> 00:49:14.372
I came here in a time machine
you invented.

724
00:49:14.749 --> 00:49:17.281
But now, I need your help
to get back to the year,

725
00:49:17.305 --> 00:49:19.544
1985.

726
00:49:20.921 --> 00:49:22.450
My God.

727
00:49:26.927 --> 00:49:29.137
Do you know what this means?

728
00:49:30.806 --> 00:49:32.490
It means that this...

729
00:49:32.689 --> 00:49:35.202
damn thing doesn't work at all!

730
00:49:35.227 --> 00:49:36.545
Doc, you got to help me.

731
00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:39.064
You are the only one who knows
how your time machine works.

732
00:49:39.649 --> 00:49:40.685
Time machine?

733
00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.672
I have not invented any time machine.

734
00:49:45.404 --> 00:49:47.222
Ok. Alright, I will prove it to you.

735
00:49:47.907 --> 00:49:49.289
Look at my driver's license.

736
00:49:49.425 --> 00:49:51.076
Expires 1987.

737
00:49:51.219 --> 00:49:52.720
Look at my birthday, for crying out loud!

738
00:49:52.745 --> 00:49:54.302
I have not even been born yet.

739
00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:55.694
And...

740
00:49:55.974 --> 00:49:57.165
look at this picture.

741
00:49:57.249 --> 00:49:58.888
It's my brother, my sister and me.

742
00:49:59.335 --> 00:50:00.782
Look at her sweatshirt Doc.

743
00:50:00.993 --> 00:50:02.816
Class of 1984?

744
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:05.720
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.

745
00:50:05.745 --> 00:50:07.428
They cut off your brother's hair.

746
00:50:08.469 --> 00:50:10.745
I am telling the truth Doc.
You got to believe me.

747
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:13.014
Then tell me, future boy,

748
00:50:14.183 --> 00:50:16.301
Who is President of the United States...

749
00:50:16.536 --> 00:50:17.954
in 1985?

750
00:50:18.354 --> 00:50:19.454
Ronald Reagan.

751
00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.396
Ronald Reagan?

752
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:21.756
The actor?

753
00:50:23.442 --> 00:50:24.900
Then who is vice president?

754
00:50:24.924 --> 00:50:25.985
Jerry Lewis?

755
00:50:27.154 --> 00:50:28.685
I suppose Jane Wyman,

756
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.804
is the First Lady.
Wait Doc!

757
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:33.038
And Jack Benny is secretary of the treasury.

758
00:50:33.077 --> 00:50:34.494
Doc, you got to listen to me.

759
00:50:34.678 --> 00:50:36.663
I have had enough practical
jokes for one evening.

760
00:50:36.747 --> 00:50:37.973
Good night, future boy!

761
00:50:37.998 --> 00:50:39.374
No, wait Doc.
Doc.

762
00:50:39.458 --> 00:50:40.331
The bruise.

763
00:50:40.355 --> 00:50:42.311
The bruise on your head,
I know how that happened.

764
00:50:42.336 --> 00:50:43.753
You told me the whole story.

765
00:50:43.838 --> 00:50:46.359
You were standing on your toilet
and you were hanging a clock,

766
00:50:46.384 --> 00:50:48.695
and you fell and you hit
your head on the sink.

767
00:50:48.801 --> 00:50:51.720
That's when you came up with
the idea for the flux capacitor,

768
00:50:51.804 --> 00:50:53.418
which... is what...

769
00:50:53.621 --> 00:50:55.867
makes time travel possible.

770
00:51:08.904 --> 00:51:10.771
There is something wrong with the starter,

771
00:51:11.053 --> 00:51:12.145
so I hid it...

772
00:51:12.426 --> 00:51:13.331
here.

773
00:51:23.586 --> 00:51:25.714
After I fell off my toilet,

774
00:51:26.415 --> 00:51:27.622
I drew this.

775
00:51:31.927 --> 00:51:33.120
The flux capacitor.

776
00:51:51.572 --> 00:51:52.864
It works!

777
00:51:55.409 --> 00:51:56.951
It works!

778
00:51:58.245 --> 00:52:00.855
I finally invent something that works!

779
00:52:01.707 --> 00:52:03.433
You bet your ass it works.

780
00:52:04.752 --> 00:52:06.961
Somehow we have got to sneak
this back to my laboratory.

781
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.498
We have got to get you home!

782
00:52:10.466 --> 00:52:11.658
Ok Doc, this is it.

783
00:52:14.037 --> 00:52:15.349
<i>Never mind that.
Never mind that now.</i>

784
00:52:15.374 --> 00:52:17.315
<i>Never mind that.</i>
What, that's me!

785
00:52:17.857 --> 00:52:19.847
Look at me!
I am an old man.

786
00:52:19.872 --> 00:52:21.035
<i>Good evening.
I am Dr. Emmett Brown.</i>

787
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.007
<i>I am standing on the...</i>

788
00:52:22.333 --> 00:52:23.675
<i>parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.</i>
Thank God!

789
00:52:23.699 --> 00:52:24.830
Look at my hair.

790
00:52:25.314 --> 00:52:26.816
What's on Earth is this thing
I am wearing?

791
00:52:27.227 --> 00:52:29.534
Well, this-this is a radiation suit.

792
00:52:29.559 --> 00:52:30.769
Radiation suit?

793
00:52:31.346 --> 00:52:32.284
Of course.

794
00:52:32.609 --> 00:52:34.589
Because of all the fallout
from the atomic wars.

795
00:52:35.825 --> 00:52:36.646
This...

796
00:52:37.339 --> 00:52:38.644
is truly amazing.

797
00:52:38.994 --> 00:52:41.027
A portable television studio.

798
00:52:41.914 --> 00:52:43.505
No wonder your president
has to be an actor.

799
00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:44.998
He has got to look good on television.

800
00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.498
Well, this is it.
This is the part coming up Doc.

801
00:52:48.921 --> 00:52:50.380
<i>No, no, no, this sucker is electrical,</i>

802
00:52:50.409 --> 00:52:53.392
<i>but I need a nuclear reaction
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...</i>

803
00:52:53.417 --> 00:52:54.510
What did I just say?

804
00:52:59.265 --> 00:53:00.348
<i>This sucker is electrical,</i>

805
00:53:00.373 --> 00:53:03.292
<i>but I need a nuclear reaction
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...</i>

806
00:53:03.317 --> 00:53:05.652
1.21 gigawatts!

807
00:53:07.273 --> 00:53:09.208
1.21 gigawatts.

808
00:53:11.485 --> 00:53:12.611
Great Scott!

809
00:53:15.312 --> 00:53:17.472
What the hell is a gigawatt?

810
00:53:18.492 --> 00:53:20.388
How could I have been so careless?

811
00:53:20.689 --> 00:53:22.579
1.21 gigawatts!

812
00:53:22.663 --> 00:53:25.373
Tom, how am I going
to generate that kind of power?

813
00:53:25.457 --> 00:53:27.083
It can't be done, can it?

814
00:53:27.167 --> 00:53:28.492
Doc, look.

815
00:53:28.603 --> 00:53:30.519
All we need is a little plutonium.

816
00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:32.844
I am sure that in 1985,

817
00:53:32.965 --> 00:53:35.192
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore,

818
00:53:35.217 --> 00:53:36.489
but in 1955,

819
00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:38.059
it's a little hard to come by.

820
00:53:38.084 --> 00:53:41.120
Marty, I am sorry,
but I am afraid you are stuck here.

821
00:53:42.725 --> 00:53:47.145
Doc, stuck here? I can't. I can't be
stuck here, I got a life in 1985.

822
00:53:47.229 --> 00:53:48.313
I got a girl.

823
00:53:48.397 --> 00:53:49.439
Is she pretty?

824
00:53:49.982 --> 00:53:51.343
Doc, she is beautiful.

825
00:53:51.968 --> 00:53:53.668
She is crazy about me.

826
00:53:53.973 --> 00:53:54.918
Look at this.

827
00:53:54.942 --> 00:53:56.422
Look what she wrote here Doc I...

828
00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:58.265
that says it all.

829
00:53:59.442 --> 00:54:00.272
Doc,

830
00:54:00.912 --> 00:54:02.320
you are my only hope.

831
00:54:02.828 --> 00:54:04.067
Marty I am sorry,

832
00:54:04.197 --> 00:54:06.309
but the only power source
capable of generating

833
00:54:06.334 --> 00:54:09.393
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

834
00:54:10.682 --> 00:54:11.607
What did you say?

835
00:54:11.632 --> 00:54:12.682
A bolt of lightning.

836
00:54:13.339 --> 00:54:16.117
Unfortunately, you never know when
or where it's ever going to strike.

837
00:54:18.779 --> 00:54:20.033
We do now.

838
00:54:25.517 --> 00:54:26.451
This is it!

839
00:54:27.318 --> 00:54:29.146
This is the answer.

840
00:54:29.714 --> 00:54:30.800
It says here,

841
00:54:31.242 --> 00:54:33.381
that a bolt of lightning
is going to strike the clock tower

842
00:54:33.406 --> 00:54:36.541
at precisely 10:04 p.m
next Saturday night!

843
00:54:40.099 --> 00:54:41.563
If we could somehow...

844
00:54:41.868 --> 00:54:43.841
harness this lightning,

845
00:54:44.752 --> 00:54:45.659
channel it...

846
00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:48.004
into the flux capacitor,

847
00:54:49.416 --> 00:54:50.609
it just might work.

848
00:54:51.502 --> 00:54:52.917
Next Saturday night,

849
00:54:53.318 --> 00:54:55.755
we are sending you back to the future!

850
00:54:56.715 --> 00:54:58.733
Ok, alright.
Saturday is good. Saturday is good.

851
00:54:58.758 --> 00:55:00.542
I can spend a week in 1955.

852
00:55:00.567 --> 00:55:02.318
I can hang out.
You can show me around.

853
00:55:02.343 --> 00:55:04.177
Marty... that is completely
out of the question.

854
00:55:04.212 --> 00:55:05.473
You must not leave this house.

855
00:55:05.724 --> 00:55:07.725
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

856
00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:10.395
Anything you do can have serious
repercussions on future events.

857
00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:11.671
Do you understand?

858
00:55:12.833 --> 00:55:13.595
Yeah.

859
00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:14.346
Sure.

860
00:55:14.387 --> 00:55:15.122
Ok.

861
00:55:15.693 --> 00:55:16.567
Marty,

862
00:55:17.319 --> 00:55:19.780
have you interacted with anybody
else today besides me?

863
00:55:22.574 --> 00:55:25.502
Yeah, well, I might have sort
of bumped into my parents.

864
00:55:25.645 --> 00:55:26.807
Great Scott!

865
00:55:27.311 --> 00:55:29.304
Let me see that photograph
again of your brother.

866
00:55:33.085 --> 00:55:34.187
Just as I thought,

867
00:55:34.273 --> 00:55:36.204
this proves my theory.
Look at your brother.

868
00:55:37.671 --> 00:55:38.796
His head is gone.

869
00:55:39.185 --> 00:55:40.567
It's like it's been erased.

870
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:43.458
Erased,

871
00:55:43.591 --> 00:55:44.701
from existence.

872
00:55:49.736 --> 00:55:51.503
They really cleaned this place up.

873
00:55:51.634 --> 00:55:52.487
Looks brand new.

874
00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.572
Now remember.

875
00:55:53.597 --> 00:55:56.099
According to my theory, you interfered
with your parents' first meeting.

876
00:55:56.211 --> 00:55:57.492
If they don't meet,
they won't fall in love,

877
00:55:57.517 --> 00:55:59.209
they won't get married
and they won't have kids.

878
00:55:59.354 --> 00:56:01.730
That's why your older brother is
disappearing from that photograph.

879
00:56:01.914 --> 00:56:04.920
Your sister will follow and unless
you repair the damage, you will be next.

880
00:56:05.188 --> 00:56:07.654
Sounds pretty heavy.
Weight has nothing to do with it.

881
00:56:08.546 --> 00:56:09.822
Which one is your pop?

882
00:56:11.591 --> 00:56:12.490
That's him.

883
00:56:13.384 --> 00:56:14.039
Ok.

884
00:56:14.446 --> 00:56:15.886
Ok, you guys.

885
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:20.682
Very funny.
You guys are being real mature.

886
00:56:20.767 --> 00:56:22.242
Maybe you were adopted.

887
00:56:22.727 --> 00:56:25.270
Ok, real mature guys.

888
00:56:26.189 --> 00:56:28.966
Ok, let me pick up my books.
McFly.

889
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:30.184
That's Strickland.

890
00:56:30.943 --> 00:56:32.728
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

891
00:56:32.954 --> 00:56:34.124
Shape up man.

892
00:56:34.581 --> 00:56:35.764
You are a slacker.

893
00:56:35.948 --> 00:56:38.134
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

894
00:56:39.023 --> 00:56:39.831
No.

895
00:56:40.536 --> 00:56:42.138
What did your mother ever see in that kid?

896
00:56:42.163 --> 00:56:43.576
I don't know Doc.
Come on.

897
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:46.929
I guess she felt sorry for him
because her dad hit him with the car.

898
00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.512
Hit me with the car.

899
00:56:50.398 --> 00:56:52.297
That's the Florence Nightingale effect.

900
00:56:52.382 --> 00:56:54.817
It happens in hospitals when nurses
fall in love with their patients.

901
00:56:55.697 --> 00:56:56.852
Go to it kid.

902
00:56:57.887 --> 00:56:58.584
Hey,

903
00:56:58.609 --> 00:56:59.668
George,

904
00:56:59.832 --> 00:57:00.863
buddy.

905
00:57:01.307 --> 00:57:03.583
I have been looking all over for you.

906
00:57:03.768 --> 00:57:06.728
You remember me, the guy who
saved your life the other day?

907
00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.055
Yeah.
Good.

908
00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.781
There is somebody
I would like you to meet.

909
00:57:15.355 --> 00:57:16.262
Lorraine?

910
00:57:17.265 --> 00:57:18.390
Calvin!

911
00:57:19.742 --> 00:57:22.394
I would like you to meet my good friend
George McFly.

912
00:57:22.578 --> 00:57:23.359
Hi.

913
00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.831
It's really a pleasure to meet you.

914
00:57:26.999 --> 00:57:28.041
How is your head?

915
00:57:28.199 --> 00:57:29.444
Good. Fine.

916
00:57:30.244 --> 00:57:31.526
I have been so worried about you

917
00:57:31.551 --> 00:57:33.427
ever since you ran off the other night.

918
00:57:33.464 --> 00:57:34.247
Are you ok?

919
00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:35.201
Yeah.

920
00:57:36.175 --> 00:57:37.426
I am sorry.
I have to go.

921
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:38.591
Come on!

922
00:57:39.595 --> 00:57:41.330
Isn't he a dreamboat?

923
00:57:45.719 --> 00:57:47.175
Doc, she didn't even look at him.

924
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.746
This is more serious than I thought.

925
00:57:48.771 --> 00:57:51.871
Apparently, your mother is amorously
infatuated with you, instead of your father.

926
00:57:53.151 --> 00:57:54.359
Wait... Wait a minute Doc.

927
00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.081
Are you trying to tell me that my mother

928
00:57:56.332 --> 00:57:57.929
has got the hots for me?

929
00:57:57.954 --> 00:57:58.979
Precisely.

930
00:57:59.143 --> 00:58:00.185
This is heavy.

931
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:02.534
There is that word again. Heavy.

932
00:58:03.119 --> 00:58:04.453
Why are things so heavy in the future?

933
00:58:04.478 --> 00:58:06.462
Is there a problem
with the Earth's gravitational pull?

934
00:58:06.706 --> 00:58:07.428
What?

935
00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:10.595
The only way we are going to get those two to
successfully mate is if they are alone together,

936
00:58:10.694 --> 00:58:13.121
so you have got to get your father
and mother to interact,

937
00:58:13.342 --> 00:58:13.992
some...

938
00:58:14.344 --> 00:58:15.832
sort of social...

939
00:58:16.966 --> 00:58:18.319
What? You mean like a date?

940
00:58:18.545 --> 00:58:19.233
Right!

941
00:58:19.719 --> 00:58:20.862
What kind of date?
I don't know.

942
00:58:20.887 --> 00:58:22.488
What do kids do in the '50s?

943
00:58:22.513 --> 00:58:24.807
What, they are your parents.
You must know them.

944
00:58:25.391 --> 00:58:27.930
What are their common interests?
What do they like to do together?

945
00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:30.645
Nothing.

946
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:31.280
Look!

947
00:58:31.765 --> 00:58:33.965
There is a rhythmic ceremonial
ritual coming up.

948
00:58:34.025 --> 00:58:35.873
Of course! The Enchantment
Under the Sea dance!

949
00:58:35.898 --> 00:58:37.503
They are supposed to go to this.

950
00:58:37.528 --> 00:58:39.362
That's where they kiss for the first time.

951
00:58:39.363 --> 00:58:40.439
Alright kid.

952
00:58:40.823 --> 00:58:42.407
You stick to your father like glue,

953
00:58:42.432 --> 00:58:44.205
and make sure he takes her to that dance.

954
00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:46.166
George, buddy.

955
00:58:46.938 --> 00:58:48.895
Remember that girl I introduced you to,

956
00:58:49.337 --> 00:58:50.337
Lorraine?

957
00:58:56.161 --> 00:58:57.287
What are you writing?

958
00:58:59.114 --> 00:59:00.115
Stories.

959
00:59:00.897 --> 00:59:02.978
Science fiction stories about...

960
00:59:03.646 --> 00:59:04.738
visitors,

961
00:59:04.931 --> 00:59:06.190
coming down to Earth,

962
00:59:06.464 --> 00:59:08.156
from other planets.

963
00:59:10.228 --> 00:59:11.701
Get out of town!

964
00:59:11.702 --> 00:59:13.897
I didn't know you did anything creative.

965
00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.424
Well, let me read some...

966
00:59:15.908 --> 00:59:16.992
No, no, no, no.

967
00:59:17.276 --> 00:59:19.711
I never, I never
let anybody read my stories.

968
00:59:20.776 --> 00:59:21.826
Why not?

969
00:59:23.332 --> 00:59:26.552
Well, what if they didn't like them,
what if they told me I was no good?

970
00:59:29.038 --> 00:59:31.673
I guess that would be pretty
hard for somebody to understand.

971
00:59:33.229 --> 00:59:34.057
No.

972
00:59:34.421 --> 00:59:35.877
No, not hard at all.

973
00:59:36.978 --> 00:59:38.100
So anyway George.

974
00:59:38.343 --> 00:59:39.579
About Lorraine.

975
00:59:40.691 --> 00:59:42.125
She really likes you.

976
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.844
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her

977
00:59:46.869 --> 00:59:48.394
to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

978
00:59:48.419 --> 00:59:49.550
Really?
Oh, yeah.

979
00:59:49.725 --> 00:59:50.923
All you got to do,

980
00:59:51.009 --> 00:59:52.558
is go over there and ask her.

981
00:59:53.729 --> 00:59:55.797
What? Right here, right now
in the cafeteria?

982
00:59:55.982 --> 00:59:57.065
What if she said no?

983
00:59:57.149 --> 00:59:59.510
I don't know if I could take
that kind of a rejection.

984
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.217
Besides,

985
01:00:02.846 --> 01:00:05.377
I think she would rather go
with somebody else.

986
01:00:07.059 --> 01:00:07.726
Who?

987
01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.476
Biff.

988
01:00:12.078 --> 01:00:13.366
Don't kid around.
Come on.

989
01:00:13.391 --> 01:00:14.641
I am gonna leave.

990
01:00:14.763 --> 01:00:16.769
You want.
You know you want.

991
01:00:16.794 --> 01:00:18.762
You know you want me to give it to you.

992
01:00:18.787 --> 01:00:20.327
Shut your filthy mouth.

993
01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:21.739
I am not that kind of girl.

994
01:00:22.842 --> 01:00:25.394
Maybe you are and you
just don't know it yet.

995
01:00:25.678 --> 01:00:27.512
Get your meat hooks off of me.

996
01:00:27.537 --> 01:00:28.578
You heard her.

997
01:00:28.723 --> 01:00:30.301
She said, get your meat hooks...

998
01:00:31.202 --> 01:00:32.000
off.

999
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:34.410
Please.

1000
01:00:35.605 --> 01:00:36.889
So what's it to you, butthead?

1001
01:00:38.816 --> 01:00:40.500
You know, you been looking for a fight.

1002
01:00:50.862 --> 01:00:52.257
Since you are new here,

1003
01:00:52.513 --> 01:00:53.902
I am going to cut you a break,

1004
01:00:54.457 --> 01:00:55.374
today.

1005
01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:58.581
So, why don't you make like a tree,

1006
01:00:59.453 --> 01:01:00.810
and get out of here.

1007
01:01:13.124 --> 01:01:14.332
George!

1008
01:01:15.762 --> 01:01:17.831
Why do you keep following me around?

1009
01:01:17.856 --> 01:01:19.214
Look, George.

1010
01:01:19.581 --> 01:01:21.042
I am telling you, George,

1011
01:01:21.067 --> 01:01:22.907
if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance,

1012
01:01:22.932 --> 01:01:24.485
I am gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

1013
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:25.968
But I can't go to the dance.

1014
01:01:25.993 --> 01:01:29.120
I will miss my favorite television
program, Science Fiction Theatre.

1015
01:01:29.145 --> 01:01:30.321
Yeah but George...

1016
01:01:30.418 --> 01:01:32.441
Lorraine, wants to go with you.

1017
01:01:32.801 --> 01:01:34.443
Give her a break.
Look...

1018
01:01:34.613 --> 01:01:36.048
I am just not ready,

1019
01:01:36.142 --> 01:01:38.176
to ask Lorraine out to the dance,

1020
01:01:38.798 --> 01:01:39.784
and not you,

1021
01:01:40.105 --> 01:01:41.995
or anybody else on this planet,

1022
01:01:42.112 --> 01:01:43.897
is going to make me change
my mind.

1023
01:01:51.555 --> 01:01:53.356
Science Fiction Theatre.

1024
01:02:25.037 --> 01:02:26.078
Who are you?

1025
01:02:31.675 --> 01:02:33.618
<i>Silence, Earthling.</i>

1026
01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:37.540
<i>My name is Darth Vader.</i>

1027
01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:44.401
<i>I am an extraterrestrial,</i>

1028
01:02:44.425 --> 01:02:46.141
<i>from the planet Vulcan.</i>

1029
01:02:48.178 --> 01:02:49.178
Marty!

1030
01:02:52.658 --> 01:02:53.934
Marty! Marty!

1031
01:02:53.959 --> 01:02:55.133
Hey, George, buddy.

1032
01:02:55.158 --> 01:02:57.134
You were not at school.
What have you been doing all day?

1033
01:02:57.455 --> 01:02:58.637
I overslept.

1034
01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:00.373
Look, I need your help.

1035
01:03:00.518 --> 01:03:01.976
I have to ask Lorraine out,

1036
01:03:02.001 --> 01:03:03.214
but I don't know how to do it.

1037
01:03:03.239 --> 01:03:04.783
Alright. Ok, listen, keep your pants on.

1038
01:03:04.807 --> 01:03:05.869
She is over in the cafe.

1039
01:03:05.894 --> 01:03:06.627
God!

1040
01:03:07.048 --> 01:03:08.119
How do you...

1041
01:03:11.218 --> 01:03:12.677
What made you change your mind, George?

1042
01:03:12.702 --> 01:03:14.737
Last night, Darth Vader came down,

1043
01:03:14.853 --> 01:03:17.672
from Planet Vulcan and told me that
if I didn't take Lorraine out,

1044
01:03:17.697 --> 01:03:19.707
that he would melt my brain.
Yeah, well...

1045
01:03:19.732 --> 01:03:22.817
Let's-Let's just keep this brain
melting stuff to ourselves, ok?

1046
01:03:22.938 --> 01:03:24.820
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Alright, ok.

1047
01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:26.441
Alright, there she is George.

1048
01:03:26.466 --> 01:03:28.017
Now just go in there and invite her.

1049
01:03:28.365 --> 01:03:30.040
Ok. But I don't know what to say.

1050
01:03:30.065 --> 01:03:32.491
Just say anything George.
Say whatever is natural,

1051
01:03:32.516 --> 01:03:34.258
the first thing that comes into your mind.

1052
01:03:35.868 --> 01:03:37.486
Nothing is coming to my mind.

1053
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:39.579
Jesus George, it's a wonder
I was even born.

1054
01:03:39.604 --> 01:03:40.681
What?
What?

1055
01:03:40.706 --> 01:03:42.200
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

1056
01:03:42.675 --> 01:03:43.513
Look,

1057
01:03:44.021 --> 01:03:46.878
tell her destiny brought you together.

1058
01:03:46.903 --> 01:03:50.271
Tell her that she is the most beautiful girl
you have ever seen in the world.

1059
01:03:50.883 --> 01:03:52.242
Girls like that stuff.

1060
01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:54.019
What are you doing George?

1061
01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:56.095
I am writing this down.
This is good stuff.

1062
01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.620
Yeah. Ok. Let's go.

1063
01:03:57.765 --> 01:03:59.224
Can you take care of that?
Right.

1064
01:04:17.743 --> 01:04:18.565
Lou,

1065
01:04:19.399 --> 01:04:20.571
give me a milk.

1066
01:04:21.984 --> 01:04:22.938
Chocolate.

1067
01:04:39.598 --> 01:04:40.513
Lorraine.

1068
01:04:41.414 --> 01:04:42.464
My density,

1069
01:04:43.245 --> 01:04:44.945
has popped me to you.

1070
01:04:45.883 --> 01:04:46.757
What?

1071
01:04:49.194 --> 01:04:50.662
What I meant to say...

1072
01:04:51.327 --> 01:04:52.027
was...

1073
01:04:52.125 --> 01:04:53.025
Wait a minute.

1074
01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:54.531
Don't I know you from somewhere?

1075
01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:56.450
Yes.

1076
01:04:56.798 --> 01:04:58.998
Yes. I am George.

1077
01:04:59.233 --> 01:05:01.052
George McFly.

1078
01:05:01.579 --> 01:05:03.046
I am your density.

1079
01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:05.248
I mean...

1080
01:05:06.959 --> 01:05:07.935
your destiny.

1081
01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.597
Hey McFly.

1082
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:15.510
Geez...

1083
01:05:17.219 --> 01:05:19.213
I thought I told you never to come in here.

1084
01:05:22.641 --> 01:05:24.051
Well, it's going to cost you.

1085
01:05:25.117 --> 01:05:26.568
How much money you got on you?

1086
01:05:26.593 --> 01:05:27.293
Well...

1087
01:05:27.813 --> 01:05:29.339
How much do you want, Biff?

1088
01:05:38.157 --> 01:05:39.341
Alright, punk.

1089
01:05:39.825 --> 01:05:40.625
Now I am going...

1090
01:05:40.808 --> 01:05:42.170
Biff. What's that?

1091
01:05:49.293 --> 01:05:50.285
Calvin Klein.

1092
01:05:50.586 --> 01:05:52.237
Oh, my God, he is a dream.

1093
01:05:53.631 --> 01:05:55.482
Kid! Kid! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1094
01:05:55.507 --> 01:05:56.674
Hey!

1095
01:05:58.844 --> 01:05:59.928
I will get it back to you, alright?

1096
01:06:00.971 --> 01:06:02.170
You broke it!

1097
01:06:03.015 --> 01:06:04.218
Come back here!

1098
01:06:06.872 --> 01:06:08.366
Look at him go!

1099
01:06:09.858 --> 01:06:10.751
Get him!

1100
01:06:24.536 --> 01:06:26.301
To the car! Go! Go!

1101
01:06:33.003 --> 01:06:34.470
What's that thing he is on?

1102
01:06:34.495 --> 01:06:35.856
It's a board with wheels.

1103
01:06:35.881 --> 01:06:37.401
He is an absolute dream.

1104
01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:38.667
Come on, come on, come on!

1105
01:06:38.842 --> 01:06:40.385
Look out! Look out for the car!

1106
01:07:13.711 --> 01:07:14.745
I am going to ram him.

1107
01:07:22.928 --> 01:07:24.000
Shit!

1108
01:07:48.629 --> 01:07:49.839
Thanks a lot kid.

1109
01:07:51.466 --> 01:07:53.384
I am going to get that son of a bitch.

1110
01:07:53.968 --> 01:07:55.010
Where does he come from?

1111
01:07:55.094 --> 01:07:56.470
Yeah, where does he live?

1112
01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.917
I don't know,

1113
01:07:59.625 --> 01:08:01.171
but I am going to find out.

1114
01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:07.966
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1115
01:08:08.724 --> 01:08:09.853
<i>They found me.</i>

1116
01:08:09.988 --> 01:08:11.762
<i>I don't know how, but they found me.</i>

1117
01:08:12.028 --> 01:08:13.295
<i>Run for it, Marty!</i>

1118
01:08:18.409 --> 01:08:19.338
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1119
01:08:20.578 --> 01:08:21.525
<i>They found me.</i>

1120
01:08:21.588 --> 01:08:23.314
<i>I don't know how, but they found me.</i>

1121
01:08:23.581 --> 01:08:24.956
<i>Run for it Marty!</i>

1122
01:08:26.124 --> 01:08:26.890
Doc?

1123
01:08:28.086 --> 01:08:29.084
Hi Marty.

1124
01:08:29.533 --> 01:08:30.794
I didn't hear you come in.

1125
01:08:31.927 --> 01:08:33.201
Fascinating device,

1126
01:08:33.581 --> 01:08:34.663
this video unit.

1127
01:08:35.551 --> 01:08:36.619
Listen Doc.

1128
01:08:37.303 --> 01:08:39.914
You know, there is something I have not told you
about the night we made that tape.

1129
01:08:39.939 --> 01:08:40.950
Please, Marty, don't tell me.

1130
01:08:40.975 --> 01:08:42.367
No man should know too much
about his own destiny.

1131
01:08:42.392 --> 01:08:43.826
You don't understand.
I do understand.

1132
01:08:43.851 --> 01:08:45.158
If I know too much about my own future,

1133
01:08:45.183 --> 01:08:46.500
I can endanger my own existence.

1134
01:08:46.646 --> 01:08:48.280
Just as you have endangered yours.

1135
01:08:50.942 --> 01:08:52.559
You are right.
Now...

1136
01:08:52.944 --> 01:08:55.721
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

1137
01:08:55.905 --> 01:08:57.656
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

1138
01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.786
I didn't have time to build it to scale
or paint it.

1139
01:09:00.159 --> 01:09:01.661
It's good.
Thank you. Thank you.

1140
01:09:03.371 --> 01:09:04.379
Ok, now.

1141
01:09:04.593 --> 01:09:07.529
We run some industrial strength electrical
cable from the top...

1142
01:09:07.646 --> 01:09:08.814
of the clock tower,

1143
01:09:08.876 --> 01:09:11.972
down, suspending it over the street
between these two lamp posts.

1144
01:09:12.797 --> 01:09:14.244
Meanwhile, we have outfitted,

1145
01:09:14.441 --> 01:09:16.698
the time vehicle with this big pole
and hook,

1146
01:09:16.884 --> 01:09:19.845
which runs directly into the flux capacitor.

1147
01:09:20.763 --> 01:09:22.297
At the calculated moment,

1148
01:09:23.188 --> 01:09:24.168
you start off,

1149
01:09:24.469 --> 01:09:25.506
from down the street,

1150
01:09:25.530 --> 01:09:28.836
driving directly toward the cable
accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

1151
01:09:30.212 --> 01:09:33.589
According to the flyer at precisely
10:04 p.m this Saturday night,

1152
01:09:33.628 --> 01:09:35.471
lightning will strike the clock tower,

1153
01:09:35.495 --> 01:09:37.099
electrifying the cable,

1154
01:09:37.334 --> 01:09:39.585
just as the connecting hook makes contact

1155
01:09:39.615 --> 01:09:41.814
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts,

1156
01:09:41.838 --> 01:09:43.243
into the flux capacitor

1157
01:09:43.619 --> 01:09:45.706
and sending you back to 1985.

1158
01:09:45.801 --> 01:09:46.788
Alright now.

1159
01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:47.823
Watch this.

1160
01:09:47.912 --> 01:09:49.529
You wind up the car and release it.

1161
01:09:51.711 --> 01:09:53.157
I will simulate the lightning.

1162
01:10:02.221 --> 01:10:03.022
Ready.

1163
01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:14.149
Set.

1164
01:10:19.322 --> 01:10:20.097
Release.

1165
01:10:38.966 --> 01:10:41.134
You are instilling me with
a lot of confidence Doc.

1166
01:10:41.159 --> 01:10:42.700
Don't worry.
I will take care of the lightning.

1167
01:10:42.725 --> 01:10:44.455
Just take care of your pop.

1168
01:10:46.432 --> 01:10:47.421
By the way,

1169
01:10:47.445 --> 01:10:49.134
what happened today?
Did he ask her out?

1170
01:10:49.464 --> 01:10:50.589
I think so.

1171
01:10:50.728 --> 01:10:51.770
What did she say?

1172
01:11:00.505 --> 01:11:02.256
It's your mom!
She is tracked you down!

1173
01:11:02.281 --> 01:11:04.133
Quick!
Let's cover the time machine.

1174
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:18.619
Hi,

1175
01:11:19.364 --> 01:11:20.340
Cal... Marty.

1176
01:11:20.841 --> 01:11:22.159
Mom. Lorraine.

1177
01:11:23.724 --> 01:11:25.340
How did you know I was here?

1178
01:11:26.931 --> 01:11:27.835
I followed you.

1179
01:11:30.008 --> 01:11:31.335
This is my doc...

1180
01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.313
My uncle.

1181
01:11:32.842 --> 01:11:33.634
Doc...

1182
01:11:34.069 --> 01:11:34.957
Brown.

1183
01:11:35.815 --> 01:11:36.865
Hi.
Hi.

1184
01:11:40.152 --> 01:11:41.141
Marty listen,

1185
01:11:41.542 --> 01:11:43.521
this may seem a little forward,

1186
01:11:43.698 --> 01:11:45.598
but I was kind of wondering if you...

1187
01:11:46.699 --> 01:11:48.750
if-if you'd ask me to the...

1188
01:11:49.442 --> 01:11:51.965
Enchantment Under
the Sea dance on Saturday.

1189
01:11:54.359 --> 01:11:55.475
You mean...

1190
01:11:56.017 --> 01:11:57.442
You mean nobody has asked you?

1191
01:11:58.379 --> 01:11:59.415
No.

1192
01:12:00.432 --> 01:12:01.460
Not yet.

1193
01:12:03.175 --> 01:12:04.837
What about?
What about George?

1194
01:12:05.043 --> 01:12:06.743
George McFly?

1195
01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:12.214
He is kind of cute and all but...

1196
01:12:12.479 --> 01:12:13.384
not...

1197
01:12:13.894 --> 01:12:14.835
Well,

1198
01:12:15.818 --> 01:12:18.198
I think a man should be strong,

1199
01:12:20.067 --> 01:12:22.019
so he can stand up for himself,

1200
01:12:23.362 --> 01:12:25.014
and protect the woman he loves.

1201
01:12:30.211 --> 01:12:31.123
Don't you?

1202
01:12:33.205 --> 01:12:34.205
Yeah I...

1203
01:12:34.694 --> 01:12:36.904
I still don't understand.

1204
01:12:37.107 --> 01:12:39.817
How am I supposed to go
to the dance with her,

1205
01:12:40.004 --> 01:12:42.356
if she is already going
to the dance with you?

1206
01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.908
Because George,
she wants to go with you.

1207
01:12:45.593 --> 01:12:47.310
She just doesn't know it yet.

1208
01:12:47.595 --> 01:12:49.084
That's why we got to show her that you,

1209
01:12:49.249 --> 01:12:50.780
George McFly, are a fighter.

1210
01:12:50.805 --> 01:12:52.700
You are somebody who is
gonna stand up for yourself,

1211
01:12:52.725 --> 01:12:54.184
somebody who is gonna protect her.

1212
01:12:54.268 --> 01:12:56.979
Yeah, but I have never picked
a fight in my entire life.

1213
01:12:57.563 --> 01:12:59.715
Ok look, you are not going
to be picking a fight Dad.

1214
01:13:00.399 --> 01:13:02.034
Dad. Dad. Daddy-o.

1215
01:13:02.567 --> 01:13:04.651
You are coming to her rescue, right?

1216
01:13:05.071 --> 01:13:06.237
Ok, let's go over the plan again.

1217
01:13:06.322 --> 01:13:08.073
8:55, where are you going to be?

1218
01:13:08.157 --> 01:13:09.741
I am going to be at the dance.

1219
01:13:09.825 --> 01:13:10.953
Right.
And where am I going to be?

1220
01:13:10.978 --> 01:13:12.979
You are gonna be in the car with her.

1221
01:13:13.004 --> 01:13:14.555
Right, ok. So right around 9 o'clock

1222
01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:15.997
she is going to get very angry with me.

1223
01:13:16.082 --> 01:13:18.000
Why is she going to get angry with you?

1224
01:13:18.584 --> 01:13:20.978
Well because, George nice girls get angry

1225
01:13:21.003 --> 01:13:23.129
when guys take advantage of them.

1226
01:13:25.508 --> 01:13:27.509
You mean you are going
to go touch her on her...

1227
01:13:27.593 --> 01:13:28.123
No.

1228
01:13:28.147 --> 01:13:29.270
No, George.

1229
01:13:29.547 --> 01:13:30.247
Look.

1230
01:13:30.778 --> 01:13:32.002
It's just an act,

1231
01:13:32.026 --> 01:13:32.737
right?

1232
01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.212
Ok. So...

1233
01:13:34.236 --> 01:13:36.743
9 o'clock you are strolling through
the parking lot.

1234
01:13:37.061 --> 01:13:38.166
You see us...

1235
01:13:38.564 --> 01:13:40.294
struggling in the car.

1236
01:13:40.573 --> 01:13:41.634
You walk up,

1237
01:13:41.913 --> 01:13:43.658
you open the door and you say...

1238
01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.051
Your line, George.

1239
01:13:50.366 --> 01:13:51.229
Hey you,

1240
01:13:51.253 --> 01:13:53.201
get your damn hands off her!

1241
01:13:55.538 --> 01:13:57.085
You really think I ought to swear?

1242
01:13:57.354 --> 01:13:59.464
Yes, definitely.
Goddamn it George, swear.

1243
01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:00.976
Ok. So now.

1244
01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:01.812
You come up.

1245
01:14:01.936 --> 01:14:03.059
You punch me in the stomach.

1246
01:14:03.084 --> 01:14:04.708
I am out for the count, right?

1247
01:14:04.922 --> 01:14:06.370
And you and Lorraine live,

1248
01:14:06.453 --> 01:14:07.982
happily ever after.

1249
01:14:08.037 --> 01:14:10.247
You make it sound so easy.

1250
01:14:10.511 --> 01:14:11.249
I just...

1251
01:14:11.273 --> 01:14:12.971
I wish I was not so scared.

1252
01:14:13.055 --> 01:14:14.539
George, there is nothing to be scared of.

1253
01:14:14.564 --> 01:14:16.307
All it takes is a little self-confidence.

1254
01:14:17.017 --> 01:14:17.756
You know,

1255
01:14:17.912 --> 01:14:19.367
if you put your mind to it,

1256
01:14:19.812 --> 01:14:21.271
you can accomplish anything.

1257
01:14:23.899 --> 01:14:26.109
<i>Hill Valley area weather
this Saturday night.</i>

1258
01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:27.391
<i>Mostly clear,</i>

1259
01:14:27.415 --> 01:14:28.910
<i>with some scattered clouds.</i>

1260
01:14:29.339 --> 01:14:31.048
<i>Lows tonight in the upper 40s.</i>

1261
01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.738
Are you sure about this storm?

1262
01:14:33.826 --> 01:14:35.977
Since when can weathermen
predict the weather,

1263
01:14:36.078 --> 01:14:37.296
let alone the future?

1264
01:14:38.429 --> 01:14:40.766
You know Marty, I am going
to be very sad to see you go.

1265
01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:42.624
You have really made
a difference in my life.

1266
01:14:42.652 --> 01:14:44.074
You have given me something to shoot for.

1267
01:14:44.839 --> 01:14:46.076
Just knowing,

1268
01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:48.535
that I am going to be around to see 1985.

1269
01:14:49.008 --> 01:14:50.825
That I am going to succeed in this!

1270
01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:53.387
That I am going to have a chance
to travel through time!

1271
01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:02.747
It's going to be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you

1272
01:15:02.772 --> 01:15:04.534
about everything that's happened
in the past few days.

1273
01:15:05.816 --> 01:15:07.401
I am really going to miss you Marty.

1274
01:15:09.737 --> 01:15:10.979
I am really going to miss you.

1275
01:15:15.951 --> 01:15:17.484
Doc, about the future...

1276
01:15:17.611 --> 01:15:18.611
No!

1277
01:15:18.844 --> 01:15:19.805
Marty!

1278
01:15:20.414 --> 01:15:24.209
We have already agreed that having information
about the future can be extremely dangerous.

1279
01:15:24.234 --> 01:15:25.735
Even if your intentions are good,

1280
01:15:25.878 --> 01:15:27.537
it can backfire drastically.

1281
01:15:29.148 --> 01:15:30.357
Whatever you have got to tell me,

1282
01:15:30.382 --> 01:15:32.474
I will find out through
the natural course of time.

1283
01:15:34.512 --> 01:15:35.771
Dear Dr. Brown.

1284
01:15:37.223 --> 01:15:39.082
On the night that I go back in time,

1285
01:15:40.142 --> 01:15:41.193
you will be...

1286
01:15:42.478 --> 01:15:43.467
shot...

1287
01:15:43.803 --> 01:15:44.948
by terrorists.

1288
01:15:45.898 --> 01:15:48.417
Please take whatever
precautions are necessary

1289
01:15:48.442 --> 01:15:50.302
to prevent this terrible disaster.

1290
01:15:52.321 --> 01:15:53.330
Your friend,

1291
01:15:55.074 --> 01:15:56.074
Marty.

1292
01:16:05.751 --> 01:16:07.142
Evening, Dr. Brown.

1293
01:16:07.608 --> 01:16:08.671
What's with the wire?

1294
01:16:08.796 --> 01:16:09.928
Oh just...

1295
01:16:10.348 --> 01:16:11.862
a little weather experiment.

1296
01:16:13.551 --> 01:16:14.551
What you got under here?

1297
01:16:14.635 --> 01:16:15.635
No!
Don't touch that!

1298
01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:17.754
Some new, specialized
weather sensing equipment.

1299
01:16:18.597 --> 01:16:20.307
You got a permit for that?

1300
01:16:21.328 --> 01:16:22.720
Of course I do.

1301
01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:31.977
Just a second.
Let me see if I can find it here.

1302
01:17:24.514 --> 01:17:25.911
Do you mind if we...

1303
01:17:26.839 --> 01:17:27.796
park...

1304
01:17:28.234 --> 01:17:29.441
for a while?

1305
01:17:30.311 --> 01:17:32.412
That's a great idea.
I would love to park.

1306
01:17:33.481 --> 01:17:35.983
Marty, I am almost 18 years old.

1307
01:17:36.275 --> 01:17:38.193
It's not like I have never parked before.

1308
01:17:38.986 --> 01:17:39.850
What?

1309
01:17:40.821 --> 01:17:43.323
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?

1310
01:17:43.908 --> 01:17:44.822
No.

1311
01:17:45.973 --> 01:17:46.720
No.

1312
01:17:51.864 --> 01:17:53.809
Lorraine, what are you doing?

1313
01:17:54.835 --> 01:17:57.082
I swiped it from the old
lady's liquor cabinet.

1314
01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:58.262
Yeah, well...

1315
01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:00.173
you should not drink.

1316
01:18:00.258 --> 01:18:02.042
Why not?
Because you...

1317
01:18:03.094 --> 01:18:04.519
You might regret it,

1318
01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.145
later in life.

1319
01:18:06.889 --> 01:18:08.607
Marty, don't be such a square.

1320
01:18:08.891 --> 01:18:10.809
Everybody who is anybody drinks.

1321
01:18:15.982 --> 01:18:17.516
Jeez, you smoke too?

1322
01:18:19.193 --> 01:18:21.595
Marty, you are beginning
to sound just like my mother.

1323
01:18:33.416 --> 01:18:34.809
<i>We are going to take a little break,</i>

1324
01:18:34.834 --> 01:18:36.798
<i>but we will be back in a while so...</i>

1325
01:18:37.098 --> 01:18:38.837
<i>don't nobody go nowhere.</i>

1326
01:18:55.396 --> 01:18:56.364
Marty?

1327
01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.690
Why are you so nervous?

1328
01:18:59.942 --> 01:19:00.942
Lorraine.

1329
01:19:02.236 --> 01:19:03.325
Have you ever...

1330
01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:07.152
been in a situation where you knew,

1331
01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:09.069
you had to act a certain way
but when you...

1332
01:19:09.210 --> 01:19:11.870
got there, you didn't know if
you could go through with it?

1333
01:19:12.455 --> 01:19:15.056
You mean like how you are
supposed to act on a first date?

1334
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.050
Sort of.

1335
01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.312
Well, I think, I know exactly
what you mean.

1336
01:19:21.429 --> 01:19:22.429
You do?

1337
01:19:23.341 --> 01:19:25.367
You know what I do in those situations?

1338
01:19:26.052 --> 01:19:26.882
What?

1339
01:19:27.261 --> 01:19:28.303
I don't worry.

1340
01:19:46.322 --> 01:19:47.619
This is all wrong.

1341
01:19:48.501 --> 01:19:50.069
I don't know what it is.

1342
01:19:51.619 --> 01:19:52.621
But when I kiss you,

1343
01:19:53.728 --> 01:19:55.338
it's like I am kissing...

1344
01:19:56.874 --> 01:19:57.949
my brother.

1345
01:19:58.674 --> 01:20:00.816
I guess that doesn't make
any sense, does it?

1346
01:20:01.337 --> 01:20:02.340
Believe me.

1347
01:20:03.805 --> 01:20:05.405
It makes perfect sense.

1348
01:20:06.895 --> 01:20:08.088
Somebody is coming.

1349
01:20:12.807 --> 01:20:16.518
You caused 300 bucks damage
to my car you son of a bitch.

1350
01:20:17.103 --> 01:20:18.999
And I am going to take it out of your ass.

1351
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Hold him.

1352
01:20:21.315 --> 01:20:23.233
Let him go Biff.
You are drunk.

1353
01:20:24.568 --> 01:20:26.728
Well, look-ey what we have here.

1354
01:20:29.824 --> 01:20:30.902
No, no!

1355
01:20:30.987 --> 01:20:32.651
You are staying right here with me.

1356
01:20:32.876 --> 01:20:34.577
Come on, Lorraine.
Let me go!

1357
01:20:34.662 --> 01:20:35.912
Leave her alone, you bastard!

1358
01:20:35.996 --> 01:20:37.831
Take him in back.
Alright, I will be right there.

1359
01:20:37.915 --> 01:20:39.747
Just admit that you want it.

1360
01:20:40.148 --> 01:20:40.800
Come on.

1361
01:20:41.225 --> 01:20:43.418
Well, go on.
This ain't no peep show.

1362
01:20:50.136 --> 01:20:51.261
Hey, let's put him in there.

1363
01:20:51.345 --> 01:20:52.123
Yeah!

1364
01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.671
That's for messing up my hair.

1365
01:20:56.645 --> 01:20:58.382
What the hell are you doing to my car?

1366
01:20:58.728 --> 01:21:01.087
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

1367
01:21:03.774 --> 01:21:06.159
Who you calling spook, peckerwood?

1368
01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:09.055
Hey, hey, listen guys...

1369
01:21:09.572 --> 01:21:11.857
Look, I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, ok?

1370
01:21:11.858 --> 01:21:13.175
Get home to your mama, boy.

1371
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:14.908
Biff!

1372
01:21:14.933 --> 01:21:16.174
Hurry, Biff!

1373
01:21:16.954 --> 01:21:18.127
Let me out of here!

1374
01:21:20.583 --> 01:21:21.893
Reginald, where are your keys?

1375
01:21:22.168 --> 01:21:23.635
The keys are in the trunk.

1376
01:21:24.795 --> 01:21:25.749
Say that again?

1377
01:21:25.774 --> 01:21:27.898
I said, the keys are in here.

1378
01:21:41.562 --> 01:21:42.854
Come on!

1379
01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:45.846
Hey you,

1380
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:47.692
get your damn hands off...

1381
01:21:50.905 --> 01:21:52.731
I think you got the wrong car McFly.

1382
01:21:54.884 --> 01:21:56.927
George, help me!
Please!

1383
01:21:56.952 --> 01:21:58.400
Just turn around McFly,

1384
01:21:58.424 --> 01:21:59.832
and walk away.

1385
01:22:00.873 --> 01:22:01.873
Please George.

1386
01:22:01.898 --> 01:22:03.100
Are you deaf McFly?

1387
01:22:03.125 --> 01:22:05.210
Close the door and beat it.

1388
01:22:07.797 --> 01:22:08.910
No Biff.

1389
01:22:09.853 --> 01:22:11.405
You leave her alone.

1390
01:22:12.134 --> 01:22:13.427
Alright McFly.

1391
01:22:17.181 --> 01:22:18.460
You are asking for it,

1392
01:22:19.278 --> 01:22:20.709
and now you are going to get it.

1393
01:22:22.228 --> 01:22:23.382
Biff stop it!

1394
01:22:24.730 --> 01:22:26.281
Biff, you will break his arm!

1395
01:22:28.484 --> 01:22:29.534
Biff no!

1396
01:22:30.569 --> 01:22:31.762
Give me a hand here Reginald.

1397
01:22:34.198 --> 01:22:36.091
Dammit man!
I sliced my hand!

1398
01:22:36.575 --> 01:22:38.034
Whose are these?
Mine.

1399
01:22:38.118 --> 01:22:39.536
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

1400
01:22:41.372 --> 01:22:42.822
You are going to break his arm!

1401
01:22:43.814 --> 01:22:44.490
Biff!

1402
01:22:44.884 --> 01:22:45.572
Biff,

1403
01:22:45.596 --> 01:22:46.934
leave him alone!

1404
01:22:47.127 --> 01:22:48.987
Let him go!
Let him go!

1405
01:23:22.746 --> 01:23:24.130
Are you ok?

1406
01:23:44.393 --> 01:23:46.028
Who is that guy?

1407
01:23:46.655 --> 01:23:47.904
That's George McFly.

1408
01:23:51.859 --> 01:23:53.702
That's George McFly?

1409
01:23:54.266 --> 01:23:55.432
Excuse me.

1410
01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.461
The storm.

1411
01:24:10.206 --> 01:24:12.672
Hey guys, you got to get back
in there and finish the dance.

1412
01:24:12.796 --> 01:24:14.213
Hey, man.
Look at Marvin's hand.

1413
01:24:14.298 --> 01:24:16.692
He can't play with his hand like that,
and we can't play without him.

1414
01:24:16.717 --> 01:24:17.581
Yeah, well. Look...

1415
01:24:17.792 --> 01:24:19.037
Marvin you got to play.

1416
01:24:19.097 --> 01:24:21.488
See, that's where they kiss for
the first time on the dance floor.

1417
01:24:21.513 --> 01:24:23.222
And if there is no music,
they can't dance.

1418
01:24:23.307 --> 01:24:24.599
If they can't dance, they can't kiss.

1419
01:24:24.683 --> 01:24:26.760
If they can't kiss,
they can't fall in love and I am history.

1420
01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:28.222
Hey man, the dance is over,

1421
01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:31.079
unless you know somebody else
that can play the guitar.

1422
01:24:38.322 --> 01:24:40.840
<i>This is for all you lovers out there.</i>

1423
01:24:54.797 --> 01:24:56.631
George, are not you going to kiss me?

1424
01:24:56.715 --> 01:24:58.216
I don't know.

1425
01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:02.136
Scram McFly.
I am cutting in.

1426
01:25:15.693 --> 01:25:17.164
Hey boy, you alright?

1427
01:25:18.821 --> 01:25:19.979
I can't play.

1428
01:25:20.364 --> 01:25:21.447
George!

1429
01:25:38.924 --> 01:25:39.974
George!

1430
01:25:41.593 --> 01:25:42.454
George.

1431
01:25:45.806 --> 01:25:46.969
Excuse me.

1432
01:26:34.313 --> 01:26:35.385
Yeah.

1433
01:26:35.531 --> 01:26:36.845
Man that was good.

1434
01:26:36.915 --> 01:26:38.278
Let's do another one.

1435
01:26:38.317 --> 01:26:40.234
No.
I got to go.

1436
01:26:40.326 --> 01:26:41.433
Come on man.

1437
01:26:41.457 --> 01:26:43.528
Let's do something that really cooks.

1438
01:26:43.906 --> 01:26:44.811
Something...

1439
01:26:45.296 --> 01:26:46.648
that cooks.

1440
01:26:52.281 --> 01:26:53.222
Alright.

1441
01:26:58.212 --> 01:26:58.954
<i>Alright.</i>

1442
01:27:00.506 --> 01:27:02.454
<i>Alright this is...
this is an oldie...</i>

1443
01:27:03.274 --> 01:27:04.178
<i>but...</i>

1444
01:27:05.928 --> 01:27:06.708
<i>Well it...</i>

1445
01:27:07.161 --> 01:27:09.373
<i>it's an oldie where I come from.</i>

1446
01:27:11.409 --> 01:27:13.660
Alright guys, listen, this is a blues riff in B.

1447
01:27:13.685 --> 01:27:16.428
Watch me for the changes,
and try and keep up ok?

1448
01:27:59.447 --> 01:28:02.251
Hey George, I heard you laid out Biff.
Nice going.

1449
01:28:02.276 --> 01:28:04.569
George, you ever think of running
for class president?

1450
01:28:25.674 --> 01:28:26.829
Chuck!
Chuck!

1451
01:28:26.986 --> 01:28:28.244
It's Marvin.

1452
01:28:28.594 --> 01:28:30.752
Your cousin, Marvin Berry.

1453
01:28:31.263 --> 01:28:34.015
You know that new sound
you are looking for?

1454
01:28:34.099 --> 01:28:35.847
Well, listen to this.

1455
01:29:44.545 --> 01:29:46.606
<i>I guess you guys are not
ready for that yet.</i>

1456
01:29:48.942 --> 01:29:50.568
<i>But your kids are going to love it.</i>

1457
01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:55.604
Lorraine.

1458
01:29:56.182 --> 01:29:58.367
Marty, that was very interesting music.

1459
01:29:59.651 --> 01:30:00.635
Yeah.

1460
01:30:00.916 --> 01:30:02.497
I... I hope you don't mind,

1461
01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:04.564
but George asked
if he could take me home.

1462
01:30:04.589 --> 01:30:05.638
Great! Good!

1463
01:30:05.779 --> 01:30:07.135
Good, Lorraine.

1464
01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:09.236
I had a feeling about you two.

1465
01:30:09.696 --> 01:30:11.155
I have a feeling too.

1466
01:30:12.031 --> 01:30:13.307
Listen, I got to go,

1467
01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:15.820
but I wanted to tell you that it's been...

1468
01:30:17.021 --> 01:30:18.103
educational.

1469
01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:20.907
Marty, will we ever see you again?

1470
01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:23.909
I guarantee it.

1471
01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:25.258
Well Marty...

1472
01:30:25.759 --> 01:30:28.285
I want to thank you
for all your good advice so...

1473
01:30:28.714 --> 01:30:29.748
I will never forget it.

1474
01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:32.042
Right, George.

1475
01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:34.740
Well...

1476
01:30:35.841 --> 01:30:37.322
good luck you guys.

1477
01:30:41.227 --> 01:30:42.405
One other thing.

1478
01:30:43.153 --> 01:30:45.094
If you guys ever have kids,

1479
01:30:45.291 --> 01:30:47.709
and one of them,
when he is eight years old,

1480
01:30:47.734 --> 01:30:50.736
accidentally sets fire
to the living room rug,

1481
01:30:52.204 --> 01:30:53.430
go easy on him.

1482
01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:55.699
Ok.

1483
01:31:00.872 --> 01:31:01.919
Marty.

1484
01:31:02.531 --> 01:31:03.807
Such a nice name.

1485
01:31:09.672 --> 01:31:11.298
Damn!
Where is that kid?

1486
01:31:15.011 --> 01:31:15.812
Damn!

1487
01:31:18.723 --> 01:31:19.798
Damn! Damn!

1488
01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:28.959
You are late!

1489
01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.817
Do you have no concept of time?

1490
01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:32.057
Hey, come on.

1491
01:31:32.236 --> 01:31:33.338
I had to change.

1492
01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:35.847
Do you think I am going back
in that zoot suit?

1493
01:31:36.961 --> 01:31:39.093
The old man really came through.
It worked.

1494
01:31:39.118 --> 01:31:41.003
What?
He laid out Biff in one punch.

1495
01:31:41.287 --> 01:31:42.523
I didn't know he had it in him.

1496
01:31:42.548 --> 01:31:44.458
He is never stood up to Biff in his life.

1497
01:31:47.043 --> 01:31:47.912
Never?

1498
01:31:48.294 --> 01:31:50.045
No. Why?
What's the matter?

1499
01:31:51.130 --> 01:31:52.023
Alright!

1500
01:31:52.678 --> 01:31:54.841
Let's set your destination time.

1501
01:31:59.597 --> 01:32:01.497
This is the exact time you left.

1502
01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:03.881
Let's send you back,

1503
01:32:03.905 --> 01:32:05.769
at exactly the same time.

1504
01:32:08.733 --> 01:32:10.184
It will be like you never left.

1505
01:32:12.610 --> 01:32:13.513
Now,

1506
01:32:13.774 --> 01:32:16.885
I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

1507
01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:18.690
That's where you will start from.

1508
01:32:19.075 --> 01:32:21.410
I have calculated the precise distance,

1509
01:32:21.494 --> 01:32:24.086
taking into account
the acceleration speed,

1510
01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:26.904
and wind resistance retroactive
from the moment,

1511
01:32:26.928 --> 01:32:28.408
the lightning strikes,

1512
01:32:28.793 --> 01:32:29.865
which will be...

1513
01:32:30.063 --> 01:32:31.283
in exactly,

1514
01:32:31.307 --> 01:32:33.296
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

1515
01:32:33.673 --> 01:32:36.171
When this alarm goes off,
you hit the gas.

1516
01:32:36.196 --> 01:32:36.990
Right.

1517
01:32:44.016 --> 01:32:44.745
Well...

1518
01:32:45.267 --> 01:32:46.893
I guess that's everything.

1519
01:32:51.274 --> 01:32:52.229
Thanks.

1520
01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:53.784
Thank you.

1521
01:32:59.031 --> 01:33:00.958
See you in about 30 years.

1522
01:33:02.869 --> 01:33:04.002
I hope so.

1523
01:33:05.872 --> 01:33:07.214
Don't worry!

1524
01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:09.851
As long as you hit that wire

1525
01:33:09.876 --> 01:33:12.961
with the connecting hook at
precisely 88 miles an hour,

1526
01:33:13.045 --> 01:33:15.647
the instant the lightning strikes
the tower...

1527
01:33:18.509 --> 01:33:19.769
everything will be fine.

1528
01:33:19.916 --> 01:33:20.683
Right.

1529
01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:31.330
What's the meaning of this?

1530
01:33:31.873 --> 01:33:33.541
You will find out in 30 years.

1531
01:33:33.566 --> 01:33:35.650
It's about the future, isn't it?

1532
01:33:35.882 --> 01:33:38.379
It's information about the future.
Wait a minute.

1533
01:33:38.529 --> 01:33:40.447
I warned you about this kid.

1534
01:33:40.537 --> 01:33:43.426
The consequences could be disastrous!

1535
01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:45.869
Doc, that's a risk you are going
to have to take.

1536
01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:48.936
Your life depends on it!
No!

1537
01:33:49.248 --> 01:33:52.801
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

1538
01:33:52.919 --> 01:33:55.403
In that case, I will tell you straight out.

1539
01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:00.951
Great Scott!

1540
01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.716
You get the cable,

1541
01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:13.499
I will throw the rope down to you.
Right! I got it!

1542
01:34:48.099 --> 01:34:49.083
Doc!

1543
01:34:57.042 --> 01:34:58.626
Come on, come on.
Let's go!

1544
01:34:58.651 --> 01:34:59.647
Alright!

1545
01:35:00.048 --> 01:35:01.119
Take it up!

1546
01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:05.328
Go!

1547
01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:13.607
Doc!

1548
01:35:13.991 --> 01:35:14.819
What?

1549
01:35:14.961 --> 01:35:18.296
I have to tell you about the future.

1550
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:19.217
What?

1551
01:35:19.242 --> 01:35:22.912
I have to tell you about the future!

1552
01:35:23.009 --> 01:35:23.868
What?

1553
01:35:24.427 --> 01:35:27.167
On the night I go back...

1554
01:35:27.464 --> 01:35:29.437
in time, you get...

1555
01:35:32.768 --> 01:35:33.719
Doc!

1556
01:35:43.279 --> 01:35:44.187
Go!

1557
01:35:45.349 --> 01:35:46.364
No Doc!

1558
01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:47.842
Look at the time!

1559
01:35:47.867 --> 01:35:50.005
You have got less than four minutes.

1560
01:35:50.082 --> 01:35:51.842
Please, hurry!

1561
01:36:03.466 --> 01:36:04.700
Yeah!

1562
01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:00.814
Dammit Doc!
Why did you have to tear up that letter?

1563
01:37:01.399 --> 01:37:02.758
If I only had more time.

1564
01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:07.437
Wait a minute.

1565
01:37:07.738 --> 01:37:09.671
I got all the time I want.
I got a time machine.

1566
01:37:09.672 --> 01:37:12.109
I can just go back early and warn him.

1567
01:37:12.368 --> 01:37:13.182
Ok.

1568
01:37:13.308 --> 01:37:14.636
Ten minutes ought to do it.

1569
01:37:17.586 --> 01:37:18.795
Time circuit's on.

1570
01:37:19.123 --> 01:37:20.363
Flux capacitor...

1571
01:37:21.116 --> 01:37:22.147
fluxing.

1572
01:37:22.266 --> 01:37:23.416
Engine running.

1573
01:37:23.487 --> 01:37:24.374
Alright.

1574
01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:28.038
No.

1575
01:37:28.351 --> 01:37:29.589
No, no, no.

1576
01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:33.054
Come on. Not this time.
Come on. Come on.

1577
01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:44.383
Come on.

1578
01:38:46.816 --> 01:38:47.985
Here we go. Here we go.

1579
01:38:48.049 --> 01:38:49.406
This time. Come on.

1580
01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:53.677
Please. Please.
Come on!

1581
01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:33.197
Doc.

1582
01:42:10.082 --> 01:42:12.066
Crazy drunk driver.

1583
01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:26.401
Alright.

1584
01:42:27.721 --> 01:42:28.467
Fred.

1585
01:42:30.061 --> 01:42:31.177
You look great.

1586
01:42:31.329 --> 01:42:32.706
Everything looks great.

1587
01:42:34.107 --> 01:42:35.235
1:24.

1588
01:42:35.334 --> 01:42:36.472
I still got time.

1589
01:42:36.496 --> 01:42:37.587
I am coming, Doc!

1590
01:42:41.671 --> 01:42:42.435
No!

1591
01:42:42.759 --> 01:42:44.111
No, not again!

1592
01:42:44.136 --> 01:42:44.897
Come on!

1593
01:42:45.248 --> 01:42:46.252
Come on!

1594
01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:01.333
Libyans.

1595
01:43:24.282 --> 01:43:26.375
No!

1596
01:43:26.659 --> 01:43:28.060
You bastard!

1597
01:43:41.508 --> 01:43:42.508
Go!

1598
01:44:17.210 --> 01:44:17.865
Doc!

1599
01:44:18.744 --> 01:44:19.237
Doc!

1600
01:44:24.801 --> 01:44:25.414
No!

1601
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.969
No!

1602
01:44:41.901 --> 01:44:43.102
You are alive.

1603
01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:53.804
Bulletproof vest?

1604
01:44:55.433 --> 01:44:56.700
How did you know?

1605
01:44:58.042 --> 01:45:00.460
I never got a chance to tell you.

1606
01:45:14.017 --> 01:45:15.456
What about all that talk...

1607
01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:17.961
about screwing up future events?

1608
01:45:18.146 --> 01:45:19.843
The space-time continuum?

1609
01:45:20.690 --> 01:45:22.148
Well, I figured...

1610
01:45:22.572 --> 01:45:23.609
what the hell?

1611
01:45:33.828 --> 01:45:35.387
So, how far ahead are you going?

1612
01:45:35.770 --> 01:45:37.131
About 30 years.

1613
01:45:37.693 --> 01:45:38.833
It's a nice round number.

1614
01:45:38.858 --> 01:45:40.394
Look me up when you get there, alright?

1615
01:45:41.195 --> 01:45:42.157
Guess I will be about...

1616
01:45:42.335 --> 01:45:43.320
47.

1617
01:45:43.418 --> 01:45:44.223
I will.

1618
01:45:45.173 --> 01:45:46.035
Take care.

1619
01:45:47.342 --> 01:45:48.145
You too.

1620
01:45:48.635 --> 01:45:49.290
Right.

1621
01:45:49.791 --> 01:45:50.669
Bye-bye Einie.

1622
01:45:51.471 --> 01:45:52.918
And watch that re-entry.

1623
01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:54.273
It's a little bumpy.

1624
01:45:55.111 --> 01:45:56.017
You bet.

1625
01:47:01.357 --> 01:47:02.683
What a nightmare.

1626
01:47:14.429 --> 01:47:17.389
If Paul calls me, tell him I am
working at the boutique late tonight.

1627
01:47:17.473 --> 01:47:19.614
Linda, first of all,
I am not your answering service,

1628
01:47:19.639 --> 01:47:21.243
second of all, somebody named Greg

1629
01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:23.144
or Craig called you just a little while ago.

1630
01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:24.813
Well, which one was it, Greg or Craig?

1631
01:47:24.897 --> 01:47:27.407
I don't know!
I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.

1632
01:47:27.432 --> 01:47:28.297
Hey.

1633
01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:31.029
What the hell is this?

1634
01:47:32.157 --> 01:47:33.157
Breakfast.

1635
01:47:33.906 --> 01:47:35.625
Did you sleep in your clothes
again last night?

1636
01:47:36.409 --> 01:47:37.509
Yeah. I...

1637
01:47:38.745 --> 01:47:40.588
Yeah. What are...
What are you wearing Dave?

1638
01:47:41.322 --> 01:47:42.138
Marty,

1639
01:47:43.098 --> 01:47:44.716
I always wear a suit to the office.

1640
01:47:46.049 --> 01:47:46.965
You alright?

1641
01:47:47.044 --> 01:47:47.961
Yeah.

1642
01:47:48.755 --> 01:47:49.838
I think we need a rematch, George.

1643
01:47:49.863 --> 01:47:51.024
A rematch?

1644
01:47:51.049 --> 01:47:52.150
Why?
Were you cheating?

1645
01:47:52.175 --> 01:47:52.934
No.

1646
01:47:53.188 --> 01:47:54.564
Hello.
Good morning.

1647
01:47:57.095 --> 01:47:57.751
Mom!

1648
01:47:58.048 --> 01:47:58.769
Dad!

1649
01:47:59.098 --> 01:48:00.580
Did you hit your head?
Marty, are you alright?

1650
01:48:00.767 --> 01:48:01.547
You guys,

1651
01:48:01.571 --> 01:48:02.884
you guys look great.

1652
01:48:02.962 --> 01:48:04.791
Mom, you look so thin.

1653
01:48:05.072 --> 01:48:06.212
Thank you Marty.

1654
01:48:06.745 --> 01:48:07.847
George!

1655
01:48:09.108 --> 01:48:10.493
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1656
01:48:12.111 --> 01:48:13.963
Good morning Dave.
Good morning Mom.

1657
01:48:13.988 --> 01:48:14.771
Linda.

1658
01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:17.532
Oh Marty, I almost forgot.
Jennifer Parker called.

1659
01:48:17.624 --> 01:48:19.097
I sure like her Marty.

1660
01:48:19.121 --> 01:48:21.251
She is such a sweet girl.

1661
01:48:21.788 --> 01:48:23.789
Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

1662
01:48:23.873 --> 01:48:25.281
What? What, Ma?

1663
01:48:25.917 --> 01:48:27.292
Aren't you going up to the lake tonight?

1664
01:48:27.317 --> 01:48:29.331
You have been planning it for two weeks.

1665
01:48:29.988 --> 01:48:32.721
Mom, we talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

1666
01:48:32.882 --> 01:48:33.877
The car is wrecked.

1667
01:48:33.902 --> 01:48:34.635
Wrecked?

1668
01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:35.561
Wrecked?

1669
01:48:35.691 --> 01:48:37.189
When did this happen?

1670
01:48:37.214 --> 01:48:38.400
Why was not I told?
Quiet down.

1671
01:48:38.425 --> 01:48:39.554
I am sure the car is fine.

1672
01:48:39.579 --> 01:48:41.830
Why am I always the last
one to know about these things?

1673
01:48:41.855 --> 01:48:44.341
See? There is Biff out there
waxing it right now.

1674
01:48:45.419 --> 01:48:47.024
Now Biff, I want to make sure that

1675
01:48:47.049 --> 01:48:49.591
we get two coats of wax this time,
not just one.

1676
01:48:49.844 --> 01:48:51.428
I am just finishing up the second coat now.

1677
01:48:51.453 --> 01:48:52.306
Now Biff,

1678
01:48:52.572 --> 01:48:54.005
don't con me.

1679
01:48:55.655 --> 01:48:57.510
I am. I am sorry, Mr. McFly.

1680
01:48:57.719 --> 01:49:00.504
I meant I was just,
just starting on the second coat.

1681
01:49:01.330 --> 01:49:03.455
Yeah Biff. What a character.

1682
01:49:03.756 --> 01:49:05.883
Always trying to get away with something.

1683
01:49:06.290 --> 01:49:08.551
I have had to stay on top of Biff
ever since high school.

1684
01:49:09.335 --> 01:49:11.420
Although, if it was not for him...

1685
01:49:11.504 --> 01:49:13.235
We never would have fallen in love.

1686
01:49:13.372 --> 01:49:14.431
That's right.

1687
01:49:15.174 --> 01:49:16.302
Mr. McFly!

1688
01:49:16.451 --> 01:49:17.944
Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

1689
01:49:17.969 --> 01:49:19.862
Oh, hi Marty.
I think it's your new book.

1690
01:49:23.122 --> 01:49:24.029
Honey.

1691
01:49:24.269 --> 01:49:26.085
Your first novel.

1692
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:29.384
Like I have always told you,
you put your mind to it,

1693
01:49:29.408 --> 01:49:31.198
you can accomplish anything.

1694
01:49:31.313 --> 01:49:32.323
Oh Marty.

1695
01:49:32.569 --> 01:49:33.737
Marty here is your keys.

1696
01:49:33.985 --> 01:49:35.677
You are all waxed up, ready for tonight.

1697
01:49:36.362 --> 01:49:37.362
Keys?

1698
01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:55.264
How about a ride, mister?

1699
01:49:55.590 --> 01:49:56.615
Jennifer.

1700
01:49:57.675 --> 01:49:59.703
Oh, are you a sight for sore eyes!

1701
01:50:00.217 --> 01:50:01.317
Let me look at you.

1702
01:50:02.453 --> 01:50:04.730
Marty, you are acting like
you have not seen me in a week.

1703
01:50:05.398 --> 01:50:06.415
I have not.

1704
01:50:07.518 --> 01:50:08.394
You ok?

1705
01:50:09.395 --> 01:50:10.695
Is everything alright?

1706
01:50:13.964 --> 01:50:14.990
Oh, yeah.

1707
01:50:17.403 --> 01:50:18.696
Everything is great.

1708
01:50:33.419 --> 01:50:34.253
Marty!

1709
01:50:35.697 --> 01:50:37.197
You have got to come back with me!

1710
01:50:38.301 --> 01:50:39.309
Where?

1711
01:50:39.759 --> 01:50:40.926
Back to the future.

1712
01:50:45.556 --> 01:50:47.082
Wait a minute.
What are you doing Doc?

1713
01:50:48.684 --> 01:50:49.768
I need fuel.

1714
01:50:53.231 --> 01:50:55.049
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.

1715
01:50:55.733 --> 01:50:57.835
No, no.
Doc, I just got here, ok?

1716
01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:59.861
Jennifer is here.
We are gonna take the new truck for a spin.

1717
01:50:59.886 --> 01:51:01.116
Well, bring her along.

1718
01:51:01.923 --> 01:51:03.223
This concerns her too.

1719
01:51:03.282 --> 01:51:04.926
Wait a minute Doc.
What are you talking about?

1720
01:51:04.951 --> 01:51:06.879
What happens to us in the future?

1721
01:51:07.138 --> 01:51:08.888
Do we become assholes or something?

1722
01:51:08.913 --> 01:51:10.038
No, no, no, no Marty.

1723
01:51:10.063 --> 01:51:11.814
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.

1724
01:51:11.958 --> 01:51:13.345
It's your kids Marty.

1725
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:15.281
Something has got to be done
about your kids.

1726
01:51:22.134 --> 01:51:25.170
Hey Doc, we better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

1727
01:51:25.195 --> 01:51:26.116
Roads?

1728
01:51:26.296 --> 01:51:29.155
Where we are going, we don't need roads.

1729
