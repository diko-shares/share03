00:10:11.817 --> 00:10:14.570
My mom thinks
I'm goin' campin' with the guys.

154
00:10:14.653 --> 00:10:16.238
Well, Jennifer,
my mother would freak out

155
00:10:16.322 --> 00:10:17.728
if she knew
I was goin' up there with you,

156
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.909
and I'd get
the standard lecture...

157
00:10:19.992 --> 00:10:22.369
about how she never did
that kinda stuff when she was a kid.

158
00:10:22.453 --> 00:10:25.331
I mean, look,
I think the woman was born a nun.

159
00:10:25.414 --> 00:10:27.917
She's just tryin'
to keep you respectable.

160
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.168
Well, she's not doin'
a very good job.

161
00:10:30.251 --> 00:10:31.461
Terrible.

162
00:10:31.544 --> 00:10:35.215
Save the clock tower.
Save the clock tower.

163
00:10:35.298 --> 00:10:39.344
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring
an initiative to replace that clock.

164
00:10:39.427 --> 00:10:42.013
Thirty years ago,
lightning struck that clock tower...

165
00:10:42.096 --> 00:10:43.848
and the clock
hasn't run since.

166
00:10:43.932 --> 00:10:46.226
We, at the Hill Valley
Preservation Society...

167
00:10:46.309 --> 00:10:48.728
think it should be preserved
exactly the way it is...

168
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:50.563
as part of our history
and heritage.

169
00:10:50.647 --> 00:10:51.761
Here you go, lady.
Here's a quarter.

170
00:10:51.773 --> 00:10:52.815
Thank you.

171
00:10:52.899 --> 00:10:54.013

172
00:10:54.025 --> 00:10:55.026

- All right. Yeah.

219
00:13:07.491 --> 00:13:09.576
I gotta have time
to get 'em retyped.

220
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.940
Do you realize what would happen

221
00:13:10.994 --> 00:13:13.789
if I handed in my reports
in your handwriting?

222
00:13:13.872 --> 00:13:15.415
I'll get fired.

00:13:18.377 --> 00:13:20.295
- Would ya?
- Of course not, Biff.

225
00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:22.839

want that to happen.

Hey, not too early.
I sleep in Saturday.

229

243
00:14:16.393 --> 00:14:18.186
But the car, Dad.

244
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.649
I mean, he wrecked it.
He totaled it.

245
00:14:23.567 --> 00:14:25.652
I needed that car
tomorrow night, Dad.

246
00:14:25.736 --> 00:14:27.904
I mean, do you have any idea
how important this was to me?

247

I think it's terrible.
Girls chasing boys.

280
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.576
When I was your age,
I never chased a boy or called a boy

281
00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.204
or sat in a parked car
with a boy.

282
00:16:00.871 --> 00:16:03.749
<i>Then how am I supposed
to ever meet anybody?</i>

283
00:16:04.416 --> 00:16:06.877
Well, it'll just happen.

284
00:16:06.961 --> 00:16:08.462
Like the way
I met your father.

285
00:16:09.338 --> 00:16:12.258
But that was so stupid.
Grandpa hit him with the car.

286
00:16:12.758 --> 00:16:14.510
It was meant to be.

287
00:16:15.386 --> 00:16:18.889
- <font color=#FFFF00>(Sighing)</font>
- Anyway...

288
00:16:18.973 --> 00:16:20.641
if Grandpa hadn't hit him,
then none of you woulda been born.

289
00:16:20.724 --> 00:16:22.017
Yeah, well.

290
00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:24.353
I still don't understand
what Dad was doin'

291
00:16:24.436 --> 00:16:25.855
in the middle of the street.

292
00:16:25.938 --> 00:16:28.399
What was it, George?
Bird-watching?

293
00:16:28.482 --> 00:16:30.609
What, Lorraine? What?

294
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.029
Anyway, your Grandpa
hit him with the car

295
00:16:34.113 --> 00:16:35.823
and brought him
into the house.

296
00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:39.118
He seemed so helpless,

297
00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:44.874
like a little lost puppy,
and my heart just went out to him.

298
00:16:44.957 --> 00:16:48.127
<font color=#FF0000>LINDA:</font><i> Yeah, Mom, we know. You've told us

300

<i>so you decided to go with him</i>

301

<i>to the "Fish Under The Sea" dance.</i>

302
00:16:52.798 --> 00:16:55.968
No. It was
the "Enchantment Under The Sea" dance.

303
00:16:56.802 --> 00:16:59.930
Our first date.
I'll never forget it.

304
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:03.058

terrible thunderstorm, remember, George?

379
00:22:29.466 --> 00:22:32.093
Calm down, Marty.
I didn't disintegrate anything.

380
00:22:32.177 --> 00:22:36.890
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

381
00:22:36.973 --> 00:22:38.350
Then where the hell are they?

382

to be exact.

387

we shall catch up with him
and the time machine.

389
00:23:02.457 --> 00:23:04.459
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Doc. Uh...

390
00:23:06.127 --> 00:23:09.005

built a time machine...

391

414

What happened?

<font color=#FFFF00>(LAUGHING)</font>

434
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.685
That was the day I invented time travel.
<i>I remember it vividly.</i>

435
00:25:29.311 --> 00:25:31.426
<i>I was standing on the edge
of my toilet, hanging a clock.</i>

436
00:25:31.438 --> 00:25:32.636
The porcelain was wet.
I slipped,

437
00:25:32.648 --> 00:25:34.191
hit my head on
the edge of the sink,

438
00:25:34.274 --> 00:25:36.318
and when I came to,
I had a revelation,

439
00:25:36.402 --> 00:25:39.738
a vision, a picture in my head,
a picture of this.

440
00:25:40.531 --> 00:25:45.160
This is what makes time travel possible.
The flux capacitor.

441
00:25:45.828 --> 00:25:47.037
Flux capacitor?

442
00:25:47.121 --> 00:25:49.581
<i>It's taken me almost 30 years
and my entire family fortune</i>

443
00:25:49.665 --> 00:25:52.083
to realize
the vision of that day.

444
00:25:52.166 --> 00:25:54.419
My God, has it been that long?

445
00:25:55.086 --> 00:25:57.922
Things have certainly changed
around here.

446
00:25:58.881 --> 00:26:00.758
I remember when
this was all farmland

447
00:26:00.842 --> 00:26:02.969
as far as the eye could see.

448
00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.681
Old man Peabody
owned all of this.

449
00:26:07.932 --> 00:26:11.519
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

450
00:26:15.648 --> 00:26:19.110
This is, uh, this is heavy-duty, Doc.
This is great.

451
00:26:19.569 --> 00:26:22.113
Uh, does it run on regular
unleaded gasoline?

452
00:26:22.196 --> 00:26:23.781
Unfortunately, no.
It requires something

453
00:26:23.865 --> 00:26:25.992
with a little more kick.
Plutonium.

454
00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:28.327
Uh, plutonium.
Wait a minute.

455
00:26:28.411 --> 00:26:30.788
Are you... are you tellin' me
that this sucker is nuclear?

456
00:26:30.872 --> 00:26:32.874
Hey, hey, hey! Keep rolling.
Keep rolling there.

457
00:26:32.957 --> 00:26:34.792
<i>No, no, no, no, no.
This sucker's electrical,</i>

458
00:26:34.876 --> 00:26:36.085
<i>but I need a nuclear reaction</i>

459
00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:38.629
<i>to generate</i> the 1.21 gigawatts
of electricity I need.

460
00:26:38.713 --> 00:26:42.300
Doc, you don't just walk into
a store and buy plutonium.

461
00:26:42.884 --> 00:26:44.552
<font color=#FF0000>MARTY:</font><i> Did you rip that off?</i>

462
00:26:46.679 --> 00:26:49.307
Of course. From a group
of Libyan nationalists.

463
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:50.671
They wanted me
to build them a bomb,

464
00:26:50.683 --> 00:26:53.215
so I took their plutonium and, in turn,
gave them a shiny bomb casing full

465
00:26:53.227 --> 00:26:54.937
of used pinball machine parts.

466
00:26:55.062 --> 00:26:57.052
- Come on, let's get you a radiation suit.
- Jesus!

467
00:26:57.064 --> 00:26:58.441

778
00:46:14.547 --> 00:46:16.841
Hey. Hey,
I, I've seen this one.

779
00:46:16.924 --> 00:46:18.404
I've seen this one!
This is a classic.

780
00:46:18.426 --> 00:46:21.720
This is where Ralph dresses up
as a man from space.

781
00:46:21.803 --> 00:46:25.223
What do you mean, you've seen this?
It's brand-new.

782
00:46:25.307 --> 00:46:27.643
Yeah, well,
I saw it on a... rerun.

783
00:46:28.393 --> 00:46:30.187
What's a rerun?

784
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:31.396
You'll find out.

785
00:46:31.897 --> 00:46:34.206
You know, Marty,
you look so familiar to me.

786
00:46:34.134 --> 00:46:36.068
<i>Do I know your mother?</i>

787
00:46:37.486 --> 00:46:39.529
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

788
00:46:39.613 --> 00:46:41.269
<font color=#FF0000>STELLA:</font> Oh, well <i>then I'll wanna
give her a call.</i>

789
00:46:41.281 --> 00:46:42.949

to worry about you.</i>

790
00:46:43.033 --> 00:46:44.409
You can't.

791
00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:45.110
Uh.

792
00:46:45.285 --> 00:46:48.580
<font color=#FFFF00>(STUTTERING)</font> That is, uh,
nobody, uh, nobody's home.

793
00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:50.957
Oh.

794
00:46:51.333 --> 00:46:52.459
Yet.

795
00:46:53.001 --> 00:46:54.086
Oh.

796
00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:58.590
Uh, listen, do you, do you know
where Riverside Drive is?

797
00:46:58.674 --> 00:47:00.795
It's, uh, on the other end of town.
A block past Maple.

798
00:47:00.869 --> 00:47:02.803
<i>East end of town.</i>

799
00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:04.262
Wait a minute,
a block past Maple.

800
00:47:04.346 --> 00:47:06.848
That's, uh, that's John F.
Kennedy Drive.

801
00:47:07.724 --> 00:47:09.726
Who the hell
is John F. Kennedy?

<font color=#FF0000>LORRAINE:</font> Uh, <i>mother?</i>

Uh, w, <i>with Marty's parents
out of town,</i>

804
00:47:14.898 --> 00:47:17.317
don't you think
he oughta spend the night?

805
00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:19.820
I mean, after all, Dad almost
killed him with the car.

806
00:47:20.028 --> 00:47:21.988
That's true, Marty.

807
00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:23.699
I think maybe you
should spend the night.

808
00:47:23.782 --> 00:47:25.325
I think you're
our responsibility.

809
00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:27.035
Oh, gee, I don't know.

810
00:47:27.119 --> 00:47:28.870
And he can sleep in my room.

811
00:47:29.579 --> 00:47:31.540
Uh, I gotta go!
I gotta go!

812
00:47:31.623 --> 00:47:33.041
Thanks very much.
It was wonderful.

813
00:47:33.125 --> 00:47:33.957
You were all great.
I'll see you all later.

814
00:47:35.232 --> 00:47:37.462
Much later.

815
00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:44.720
He's a very strange
young man.

816
00:47:44.803 --> 00:47:45.929
He's an idiot.

817
00:47:46.263 --> 00:47:49.975
<i>Comes from upbringing.
His parents are probably idiots, too.</i>

818
00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:51.560
<i>Lorraine, you ever have a kid</i>

819
00:47:51.643 --> 00:47:53.937
<i>who acts that way,
I'll disown you.</i>

820
00:48:32.017 --> 00:48:33.101
Doc?

821
00:48:34.019 --> 00:48:35.562
Don't say a word.

824
00:48:38.023 --> 00:48:39.262
I don't wanna know
anything about you.

825
00:48:39.274 --> 00:48:41.026

<font color=#C0C0C0>Doc, it's me, Marty. You gotta...
Doc... You gotta help...</font>

827
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.682
Don't tell me anything.

828
00:48:42.694 --> 00:48:44.863
- Doc, you got to help...
- Quiet. Quiet.

<font color=#FFFF00>(ELECTRONIC WARBLING)</font>

830
00:48:47.616 --> 00:48:49.618
I'm gonna read your thoughts.

831
00:48:49.701 --> 00:48:53.287
Let's see now. You've come here
from a great distance?

832
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:54.497
Yeah. Exactly.

833
00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.706
Now, don't tell me!

834
00:48:56.373 --> 00:48:57.792
Ah... <i>You want me to
buy a subscription</i>

835
00:48:57.875 --> 00:48:59.210
<i>to</i> The Saturday Evening Post?

836
00:48:59.293 --> 00:49:00.336
No.

837
00:49:00.419 --> 00:49:01.879
Not a word. Not a word.
Not a word, now!

838
00:49:01.962 --> 00:49:03.130
Quiet.

839
00:49:05.299 --> 00:49:06.750
Uh... donations.

840
00:49:06.827 --> 00:49:08.886
You want me
to make a donation...

841
00:49:08.969 --> 00:49:11.222
to the Coast Guard
Youth Auxiliary.

842
00:49:11.806 --> 00:49:13.224
Doc.

843
00:49:14.725 --> 00:49:15.768
I'm from the future.

844
00:49:15.851 --> 00:49:16.924
<font color=#FFFF00>(ELECTRONIC WARBLING STOPS)</font>

845
00:49:16.936 --> 00:49:20.064
I came here in a time machine
that you invented.

846
00:49:20.439 --> 00:49:22.574
Now, I need your help to get back
to the year...

847
00:49:22.642 --> 00:49:25.236
1985.

848
00:49:26.612 --> 00:49:28.197
By God!

849
00:49:32.618 --> 00:49:34.829
Do you know
what this means?

850
00:49:36.497 --> 00:49:40.835
It means that this damn thing
doesn't work at all!

851
00:49:40.836 --> 00:49:42.336
<font color=#C0C0C0>Six months labor for nothing!</font>

852
00:49:40.918 --> 00:49:42.837
Doc, you gotta help me.
You're the only one

853
00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.256
who knows how your
time machine works.

854
00:49:45.339 --> 00:49:47.168
Time machine?

855
00:49:47.242 --> 00:49:49.176
I haven't invented
any time machine.

856
00:49:51.095 --> 00:49:53.514
Okay. All right,
I'll prove it to you.

857
00:49:53.597 --> 00:49:56.767
Look at my driver's license.
Expires 1987.

858
00:49:56.851 --> 00:49:58.423
Look at my birthday,
for cryin' out loud!

859
00:49:58.435 --> 00:50:00.437
I, I haven't even been born yet.

860
00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:02.857
And, look at this picture.

861
00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.942
My brother,
my sister and me.

862
00:50:05.025 --> 00:50:08.320
Look at her sweatshirt, Doc.
"Class of 1984"?

863
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.282
Pretty mediocre
photographic fakery.

864
00:50:11.365 --> 00:50:13.617
They cut off
your brother's hair.

865
00:50:14.159 --> 00:50:16.537
I'm tellin' the truth, Doc.
You've gotta believe me.

866
00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.706
Then tell me, "future boy."

867
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:19.790
<font color=#FFFF00>(LAUGHING)</font>

868
00:50:19.874 --> 00:50:23.627
Who's president
of the United States in 1985?

869
00:50:24.044 --> 00:50:25.087
Ronald Reagan.

870
00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:27.548
Ronald Reagan?
The actor? Ha!

871
00:50:27.798 --> 00:50:29.049
<font color=#FFFF00>(EXCLAIMS)</font>

872
00:50:29.133 --> 00:50:31.677
Then who's vice president?
Jerry Lewis?

873
00:50:32.845 --> 00:50:35.222
I suppose Jane Wyman
is the First Lady.

874
00:50:35.306 --> 00:50:36.390
Whoa. Wait, Doc!

875
00:50:36.473 --> 00:50:38.684
And Jack Benny
is secretary of the treasury. Ah!

876
00:50:38.767 --> 00:50:40.185
Doc, you gotta listen to me.

877
00:50:40.269 --> 00:50:42.354
I've had enough practical
jokes for one evening.

878
00:50:42.438 --> 00:50:43.606
Good night, "future boy!"

879
00:50:43.689 --> 00:50:45.065
No, wait, Doc! Doc,

880
00:50:45.149 --> 00:50:47.943
th-the bruise on your head,
I know how that happened.

881
00:50:48.027 --> 00:50:49.445
You told me the whole story.

882
00:50:49.528 --> 00:50:50.988
You were standing on
your toilet

883
00:50:51.071 --> 00:50:52.185
and you were hangin' a clock,

884
00:50:52.197 --> 00:50:54.408
and you fell and you hit your head
on the sink,

885
00:50:54.491 --> 00:50:57.411
and that's when you came up
with the idea for the flux capacitor,

886
00:50:57.494 --> 00:51:01.498
which is what makes
time travel possible.

887
00:51:01.624 --> 00:51:02.917
<font color=#FFFF00>(DOOR UNLOCKING)</font>

888
00:51:14.595 --> 00:51:18.766
There's something wrong with
the starter, so I hid it... here.

889
00:51:29.275 --> 00:51:30.018
After I fell
off my toilet,

890
00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:33.112
I drew this.

891
00:51:37.617 --> 00:51:39.410
<i>The flux capacitor.</i>

893
00:51:57.261 --> 00:51:58.554

<font color=#FFFF00>(DOC LAUGHING)</font>

895
00:52:01.099 --> 00:52:02.642
It works!

896
00:52:03.935 --> 00:52:06.646
I finally invent something
that works!

897
00:52:07.397 --> 00:52:09.524
You bet your ass
it works.

898
00:52:10.441 --> 00:52:13.486
Somehow we've gotta sneak this
back to my laboratory.

899
00:52:13.569 --> 00:52:15.488
We've gotta get you home!

900
00:52:16.155 --> 00:52:17.949
Here, Doc,
this is it.

901
00:52:19.742 --> 00:52:21.828
<i>Never mind that. Never mind that now.
Never mind that, Never mind.</i>

902
00:52:21.911 --> 00:52:25.331
Why, that's me! Look at me!
I'm an old man.

903
00:52:25.415 --> 00:52:26.737
<i>Good evening.
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.</i>

904
00:52:26.749 --> 00:52:28.835
<i>I'm standing here on the parking lot
o' Twin Pines Mall.</i>

905
00:52:28.918 --> 00:52:30.920
Thank God,
I've still got my hair.

906
00:52:31.004 --> 00:52:33.006
But what on Earth is
this thing I'm wearing?

907
00:52:33.089 --> 00:52:35.258
Well, this, this is a radiation suit.

908
00:52:35.341 --> 00:52:37.093
Radiation suit?

909
00:52:37.176 --> 00:52:40.179
Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout
from the atomic wars.

00:52:41.514 --> 00:52:44.183
This... is truly amazing.

912
00:52:44.684 --> 00:52:47.520
A portable television studio.

913
00:52:47.603 --> 00:52:49.176
No wonder your president
has to be an actor.

914
00:52:49.188 --> 00:52:51.357
He's gotta look good
on television.

915
00:52:51.441 --> 00:52:53.860
Whoa. This is it.
This is the part comin' up, Doc.

916
00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:56.070
<i>No, no, no, no.

917
00:52:56.154 --> 00:52:57.268

919
00:52:59.157 --> 00:53:00.950

1.21 gigawatts.

926
00:53:17.175 --> 00:53:18.801
Great Scott!

927
00:53:18.869 --> 00:53:20.588
<i>What...</i>

928
00:53:20.656 --> 00:53:23.181
What the hell
is a gigawatt?

929
00:53:24.182 --> 00:53:26.210
How could I have been
so careless?

930
00:53:26.278 --> 00:53:28.269
1.21 gigawatts!

931
00:53:28.352 --> 00:53:31.064
Tom, how am I gonna generate
that kind o' power?

932
00:53:31.147 --> 00:53:32.774
It can't be done, can it?

933
00:53:32.857 --> 00:53:35.610
Doc, look. All we need
is a little plutonium.

934
00:53:35.693 --> 00:53:36.736
<font color=#FFFF00>(EXCLAIMS)</font>

935
00:53:36.819 --> 00:53:38.571
Ha, I'm sure
that in 1985,

936
00:53:38.654 --> 00:53:40.823
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore,

937
00:53:40.907 --> 00:53:43.659
but in 1955,
it's a little hard to come by.

938
00:53:43.743 --> 00:53:47.080
Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

939
00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:48.331
Whoa, whoa.

940
00:53:48.414 --> 00:53:50.332
Doc, stuck here?
I, I can't be stuck here.

941
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:52.835
I got a life in 1985.

942
00:53:52.919 --> 00:53:54.003
I got a girl.

943
00:53:54.087 --> 00:53:55.129
Is she pretty?

944
00:53:55.671 --> 00:53:58.504
Doc, she's beautiful.
She's...

945
00:53:58.574 --> 00:54:00.701
She's crazy about me.
Look at this.

946
00:54:00.776 --> 00:54:02.869
Look what she
wrote here, Doc.

947
00:54:02.945 --> 00:54:04.012
I mean,
that says it all.

948
00:54:05.263 --> 00:54:07.849
Doc, you're my only hope.

949
00:54:08.517 --> 00:54:11.853
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only
power source capable of generating...

950
00:54:11.937 --> 00:54:15.357
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

951
00:54:16.566 --> 00:54:17.692
What did you say?

952
00:54:17.776 --> 00:54:18.944
A bolt of lightning.

953
00:54:19.027 --> 00:54:20.100
Unfortunately, you never know

954
00:54:20.112 --> 00:54:23.240
when or where it's
ever gonna strike.

955
00:54:24.741 --> 00:54:26.118
We do now.

956
00:54:31.206 --> 00:54:34.793
This is it!
<i>This</i> is the answer.

957
00:54:35.544 --> 00:54:37.963
It says here
that a bolt of lightning...

958
00:54:38.046 --> 00:54:39.119
is gonna
strike the clock tower

959
00:54:39.131 --> 00:54:42.384
at precisely 10:04 p.m.
next Saturday night!

960
00:54:45.929 --> 00:54:49.391
If we could somehow harness
this lightning,

961
00:54:50.559 --> 00:54:53.812
channel it into
the flux capacitor,

962
00:54:55.105 --> 00:54:56.898
<i>it just might work.</i>

963
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:59.488
Next Saturday night...

964
00:54:59.559 --> 00:55:01.444
we're sending you
back to the future!

965
00:55:02.404 --> 00:55:04.352
Okay, all right. Saturday's good.
Saturday's good.

966
00:55:04.364 --> 00:55:06.158
I can spend a week in 1955.

967
00:55:06.241 --> 00:55:07.993
I can hang out.
You can show me around.

968
00:55:08.076 --> 00:55:09.911
Marty, that is completely
outta the question.

969
00:55:09.995 --> 00:55:11.329
You must not leave this house.

970
00:55:11.413 --> 00:55:13.415
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

971
00:55:13.498 --> 00:55:16.084
Anything you do, can have serious
repercussions on future events.

972
00:55:16.168 --> 00:55:17.919
Do you understand?

973
00:55:18.795 --> 00:55:20.755
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

974
00:55:21.381 --> 00:55:22.591
Marty,

975
00:55:23.008 --> 00:55:26.469
have you interacted with
anybody else today, besides me?

976
00:55:28.263 --> 00:55:31.391
I'm... Yeah, well, I mighta
sort of bumped into my parents.

977
00:55:31.474 --> 00:55:33.018
Great Scott!

978
00:55:33.101 --> 00:55:35.395
Let me see that photograph again
of your brother.

979
00:55:35.396 --> 00:55:36.396
Uh...

980
00:55:38.773 --> 00:55:42.194
Just as I thought. This proves
my theory. Look at your brother.

981
00:55:43.445 --> 00:55:46.656
<font color=#FF0000>MARTY:</font><i> His head's gone.</i> Looks like,
<i>it's like, it's been erased.</i>

982
00:55:48.325 --> 00:55:50.368
Erased from existence.

983
00:55:54.956 --> 00:55:56.041
Whoa.

984
00:55:56.124 --> 00:55:58.877
They really cleaned this place up.
Looks brand-new.

985
00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.961
<font color=#FF0000>DOC:</font> Now remember.

986
00:56:00.045 --> 00:56:01.367
According to my theory,
you interfered

987
00:56:01.379 --> 00:56:02.619
with your parents'
first meeting.

988
00:56:02.631 --> 00:56:03.953
If they don't meet,
they won't fall in love,

989
00:56:03.965 --> 00:56:05.830
they won't get married
and they won't have kids.

990
00:56:05.842 --> 00:56:06.956
That's why your older brother's

991
00:56:06.968 --> 00:56:08.288
disappearing from
that photograph.

992
00:56:08.303 --> 00:56:10.584
Your sister will follow,
and unless you repair the damage,

993
00:56:10.597 --> 00:56:11.806
you'll be next.

994
00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:13.796
- <font color=#FF0000>MARTY:</font> Sounds pretty heavy.
- Weight has nothing to do with it.

995
00:56:13.808 --> 00:56:14.851
<font color=#FFFF00><i>(BELL RINGING)</i></font>

996
00:56:14.935 --> 00:56:16.811
Which one's your pop?

997
00:56:17.979 --> 00:56:19.314
That's him.

998
00:56:19.773 --> 00:56:22.192
Okay.
Okay, you guys.

999
00:56:22.317 --> 00:56:23.735
- <font color=#FFFF00>(LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY)</font>
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1000
00:56:23.818 --> 00:56:27.072
Very funny. You guys
are being real mature. Ha, ha, ha...

1001
00:56:27.155 --> 00:56:29.032
Maybe you were adopted.

1002
00:56:29.115 --> 00:56:31.660
Okay, real mature, guys.

1003
00:56:32.577 --> 00:56:33.953
Okay, Dixon, pick up my books.

1004
00:56:34.036 --> 00:56:35.079
- McFly.
- Yes?

1005
00:56:35.162 --> 00:56:36.872
That's Strickland.

1006
00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:39.416
Jesus, didn't that guy
ever have hair?

1007
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.253
Shape up, man.
You're a slacker.

1008
00:56:42.336 --> 00:56:45.422
Do you wanna be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

1009
00:56:45.506 --> 00:56:46.548
No.

1010
00:56:46.924 --> 00:56:48.538
What did your mother
ever see in that kid?

1011
00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:49.843
I don't know, Doc.

1012
00:56:49.927 --> 00:56:51.637
I, I guess she felt sorry for him

1013
00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.056
'cause her dad hit him
with the car.

1014
00:56:54.348 --> 00:56:56.600
He hit me
with the car.

1015
00:56:56.684 --> 00:56:58.686
That's the
"Florence Nightingale effect."

1016
00:56:58.769 --> 00:57:02.106
It happens in hospitals when nurses
fall in love with their patients.

1017
00:57:02.189 --> 00:57:03.440
Go to it, kid.

1018
00:57:04.275 --> 00:57:07.111
Hey, George, buddy.

1019
00:57:07.695 --> 00:57:10.072
I have been lookin'
all over for you.

1020
00:57:10.155 --> 00:57:13.117
Do you remember me? The guy who
saved your life the other day?

1021
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.285
Oh.

1022
00:57:14.368 --> 00:57:15.369
- Yeah.
- Good.

1023
00:57:15.452 --> 00:57:17.454
There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

1024
00:57:21.875 --> 00:57:23.460
Lorraine?

1025
00:57:23.544 --> 00:57:24.670
Calvin!

1026
00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:28.882
I'd like you to meet
my good friend, George McFly.

1027
00:57:28.966 --> 00:57:32.219
Hi. It's really
a pleasure to meet you.

1028
00:57:33.387 --> 00:57:34.430
How's your head?

1029
00:57:34.513 --> 00:57:35.848
Uh, good. Fine.

1030
00:57:35.931 --> 00:57:37.808
Oh. I've been so
worried about you

1031
00:57:37.891 --> 00:57:39.768
ever since you ran off
the other night.

1032
00:57:39.852 --> 00:57:41.312
- A-Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1033
00:57:41.395 --> 00:57:42.479
- <font color=#FFFF00><i>(BELL RINGING)</i></font>
- Come on, we're tardy.

1034
00:57:42.563 --> 00:57:43.814
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

1035
00:57:43.897 --> 00:57:45.149
Come on!

1036
00:57:45.983 --> 00:57:47.818
Isn't he a dreamboat?

1037
00:57:51.947 --> 00:57:53.532
Doc, she didn't
even look at him.

1038
00:57:53.615 --> 00:57:55.159
This is more serious
than I thought.

1039
00:57:55.242 --> 00:57:57.274
Apparently, your mother
is amorously infatuated with you,

1040
00:57:57.286 --> 00:57:58.912
instead of your father.

1041
00:57:59.538 --> 00:58:00.664
Whoa. Wa, Wait a minute, Doc.

1042
00:58:00.748 --> 00:58:01.543
Are you tryin' to tell me...

1043
00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:04.418
that my mother
has got the hots for me?

1044
00:58:04.501 --> 00:58:05.627
Precisely.

1045
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:06.754
Whoa. This is heavy.

1046
00:58:07.338 --> 00:58:09.423
There's that word again.
"Heavy."

1047
00:58:09.506 --> 00:58:10.912
Why are things so heavy
in the future?

1048
00:58:10.924 --> 00:58:13.081
Is there a problem with
the Earth's gravitational pull?

1049
00:58:13.093 --> 00:58:14.178
- What?
- The only way

1050
00:58:14.261 --> 00:58:15.751
we're gonna get those two
to successfully mate

1051
00:58:15.763 --> 00:58:17.139
is if they're alone together,

1052
00:58:17.222 --> 00:58:19.850
so you've gotta get your father
and mother to interact

1053
00:58:19.933 --> 00:58:22.019
in some sort of social...

1054
00:58:22.102 --> 00:58:23.228
<font color=#FFFF00>(SIGHS)</font>

1055
00:58:23.354 --> 00:58:24.897
- What, like, you mean like a date?
- Right!

1056
00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:26.023
<font color=#FFFF00><i>(BELL RINGING)</i></font>

1057
00:58:26.106 --> 00:58:27.262
What kind of date?
I don't know.

1058
00:58:27.274 --> 00:58:28.817
What do kids do in the '50s?

1059
00:58:28.901 --> 00:58:31.695
Uh, but... They're your parents.
You must know them.

1060
00:58:31.779 --> 00:58:32.976
What are their common interests?

1061
00:58:32.988 --> 00:58:34.948
What do they
like to do together?

1062
00:58:35.949 --> 00:58:37.034
Nothing.

1063
00:58:37.117 --> 00:58:40.329
<i>Look! There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.</i>

1064
00:58:40.412 --> 00:58:42.373
Of course!
The Enchantment Under The Sea dance!

1065
00:58:42.456 --> 00:58:43.832
They're supposed to go to this.

1066
00:58:43.916 --> 00:58:45.667
That's where they kiss
for the first time.

1067
00:58:45.751 --> 00:58:47.127
All right, kid.

1068
00:58:47.211 --> 00:58:48.796
You stick
to your father like glue

1069
00:58:48.879 --> 00:58:50.479
and make sure he takes her
to that dance.

1070
00:58:51.131 --> 00:58:52.633
George, buddy.

1071
00:58:53.467 --> 00:58:56.720
Remember that girl
I introduced you to, Lorraine?

1072
00:59:02.768 --> 00:59:04.395
Whatta you writing?

1073
00:59:04.478 --> 00:59:06.480
Uh... Stories.

1074
00:59:07.313 --> 00:59:10.858
Science fiction stories
about, uh, visitors...

1075
00:59:11.317 --> 00:59:14.570
coming down to Earth
from other planets.

1076
00:59:16.614 --> 00:59:20.284
Get outta town! I didn't know
you did anything creative.

1077
00:59:20.785 --> 00:59:21.911
Lemme read some.

1078
00:59:21.994 --> 00:59:23.579
Oh. No, no, no, no.

1079
00:59:23.663 --> 00:59:26.499
I never, I never let
anybody read my stories.

1080
00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:28.501
Why not?

1081
00:59:28.918 --> 00:59:30.795
Oh, what if they
didn't like them?

1082
00:59:30.878 --> 00:59:33.339
What if they told me
I was no good?

1083
00:59:35.425 --> 00:59:38.261
I guess that would be pretty hard
for somebody to understand.

1084
00:59:39.679 --> 00:59:42.265
Uh, no.
No, not hard at all.

1085
00:59:43.474 --> 00:59:46.018
So anyway, George,
about Lorraine.

1086
00:59:47.186 --> 00:59:49.021
She really likes you.

1087
00:59:49.981 --> 00:59:52.942
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her

1088
00:59:53.025 --> 00:59:54.777
to the Enchantment
Under The Sea dance.

1089
00:59:54.861 --> 00:59:56.028
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1090
00:59:56.112 --> 00:59:59.198
All you gotta do
is go over there and ask her.

1091
01:00:00.116 --> 01:00:02.285
What? Right here, right now,
in the cafeteria?

1092
01:00:02.368 --> 01:00:03.453
What if she said no?

1093
01:00:03.536 --> 01:00:06.998
I don't know if I could take
that kind of a rejection.

1094
01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:11.711
Besides, I think she'd
rather go with somebody else.

1095
01:00:13.045 --> 01:00:14.213
Uh, who?

1096
01:00:16.007 --> 01:00:17.133
Biff.

1097
01:00:18.676 --> 01:00:19.802
Come on. Don't kid us.
Come on!

1098
01:00:19.886 --> 01:00:21.137
No. I'm gonna leave.

1099
01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.097
<font color=#FF0000>BIFF:</font> Wha... <i>You want it.
You know you want it.</i>

1100
01:00:23.181 --> 01:00:25.308
You know you want me
to give it to you.

1101
01:00:25.391 --> 01:00:27.977
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

1102
01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.145
- Ooh.
- <font color=#FFFF00>(EXCLAIMS)</font>

1103
01:00:29.228 --> 01:00:31.981
Well, maybe you are and you
just don't know it yet.

1104
01:00:32.064 --> 01:00:33.900
Get your meat hooks off of me.

1105
01:00:33.983 --> 01:00:35.026
<font color=#FF0000>MARTY:</font><i> You heard her.</i>

1106
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:36.389
<i>She said,
get your meat hooks...</i>

1107
01:00:36.463 --> 01:00:38.488
off.

1108
01:00:39.906 --> 01:00:41.157
Uh, please.

1109
01:00:41.991 --> 01:00:44.076
So what's it to you,
butthead?

1110
01:00:45.203 --> 01:00:47.470
You know, you've been
lookin' for a...

1111
01:00:47.538 --> 01:00:48.789
<font color=#FF0000>STUDENTS:</font> Fight, fight, fight.

1112

Look, George,
I'm telling you, George,

1120
01:01:27.453 --> 01:01:29.205
if you do not ask Lorraine
to that dance,

1121
01:01:29.288 --> 01:01:30.861
I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

1122
01:01:30.873 --> 01:01:32.333
But I can't go to the dance.

Yeah, but, George,
Lorraine wants to go with you.

1125
01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:40.216
Give her a break.

1126
01:01:40.299 --> 01:01:44.469
Look, I'm just not ready
to ask Lorraine out to the dance,

1127

Last night, Darth Vader
came down from Planet Vulcan

and told me that if I didn't take
Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.

Yeah, well, uh, listen, let's just keep this

you start off from down the street,

According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 p.m. this Saturday night,

1271
01:09:40.650 --> 01:09:44.279
lightning will strike the clock tower,
electrifying the cable

1272
01:09:44.362 --> 01:09:46.614
just as the connecting hook
makes contact

1273
01:09:46.698 --> 01:09:50.326
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor

1274
01:09:50.702 --> 01:09:52.871
and sending you back to 1985.

1275
01:09:52.954 --> 01:09:54.998
<i>All right, now.
Watch this.</i>

1276
01:09:55.081 --> 01:09:57.000
You wind up the car
and release it.

1277
01:09:58.793 --> 01:10:01.004
I'll simulate the lightning.

1282
01:10:26.404 --> 01:10:27.655

with a lot of confidence, Doc.</i>

1287
01:10:48.301 --> 01:10:49.749
Don't worry. I'll take care
of the lightning.

1288
01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:52.347
You just take care of your pop.

1289
01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:56.518
By the way, what happened today?
Did he ask her out?

1290
01:10:56.601 --> 01:10:57.727
I think so.

1291
01:10:57.811 --> 01:10:58.853
What did she say?

1292
01:10:59.187 --> 01:11:00.522
<font color=#FFFF00><i>(KNOCKING ON DOOR)</i></font>

1293
01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:09.280
It's your mom!
She's tracked you down!

1294
01:11:09.364 --> 01:11:11.616
<i>Quick! Let's cover
the time machine.</i>

1295
01:11:24.963 --> 01:11:27.423
Hi, Mar... Cal... Marty.

1296
01:11:27.924 --> 01:11:29.342
Mom. Lorraine.

1297
01:11:30.885 --> 01:11:33.096
Uh, how did you know
I was here?

1298
01:11:34.013 --> 01:11:35.557
Uh, I followed you.

1299
01:11:36.391 --> 01:11:38.393
Oh, uh... this is my,
uh, Doc, uh,

1300
01:11:38.476 --> 01:11:41.563
- <font color=#FFFF00>(STUTTERS)</font>
- My uncle, <i>Doc Brown.</i>

1301
01:11:42.897 --> 01:11:44.149
- Hi.
- Hi.

1302
01:11:44.216 --> 01:11:46.844
<font color=#FFFF00>(SNIFFLES)</font>

1303
01:11:47.235 --> 01:11:50.405
Uh, Marty, this may
seem a little forward,

1304
01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:53.000
but I was kinda
wondering if...

1305
01:11:53.074 --> 01:11:55.872
I-if you'd ask me to the...

1306
01:11:55.943 --> 01:11:58.912
Enchantment Under The Sea dance
on Saturday?

1307
01:12:01.582 --> 01:12:04.793
Wow, you mean...
You mean, nobody's asked you?

1308
01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:08.547
No. Not yet.

1309
01:12:10.257 --> 01:12:11.800
What about,
what about George?

1310
01:12:11.884 --> 01:12:13.677
George McFly?

1311
01:12:16.221 --> 01:12:20.225
Oh, he's kinda cute
and all, but I, not...

1312
01:12:21.101 --> 01:12:25.230
Well, I think
a man should be strong,

1313
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:29.401
so he can
stand up for himself

1314
01:12:30.444 --> 01:12:32.696
and protect
the woman he loves.

1315
01:12:37.409 --> 01:12:38.785
Don't you?

1316
01:12:40.287 --> 01:12:41.371
Yeah. H'h.

1317
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:43.832
I still don't understand.

1318
01:12:44.291 --> 01:12:47.002
How am I supposed to go
to the dance with her,

1319
01:12:47.085 --> 01:12:49.838
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

1320
01:12:49.922 --> 01:12:52.591
Well, because, George,
she <i>wants</i> to go with you.

1321
01:12:52.674 --> 01:12:54.593
She just doesn't
know it yet.

1322
01:12:54.676 --> 01:12:55.749
That's why we gotta show her

1323
01:12:55.761 --> 01:12:57.721
that you,
George McFly, are a fighter.

1324
01:12:57.804 --> 01:12:59.764
You're somebody who's gonna
stand up for yourself,

1325
01:12:59.806 --> 01:13:01.266
somebody who's
gonna protect her.

1326
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:04.561
Yeah, but I've never
picked a fight in my entire life.

1327
01:13:04.645 --> 01:13:07.397
Look, you're not gonna be
pickin' a fight, Dad...

1328
01:13:07.481 --> 01:13:09.691
- <font color=#FFFF00>(STUTTERS)</font>
- dad-dad-daddio.

1329
01:13:09.775 --> 01:13:12.069
You're coming
to her rescue, right?

1330
01:13:12.152 --> 01:13:13.391
Okay, let's go over
the plan again.

1331
01:13:13.403 --> 01:13:15.155
8:55, where're you gonna be?

1332
01:13:15.239 --> 01:13:16.823
I'm gonna be at the dance.

1333
01:13:16.907 --> 01:13:18.021
Right. And where
am I gonna be?

1334
01:13:18.033 --> 01:13:20.035
You're gonna be
in the car with her.

1335
01:13:20.118 --> 01:13:21.578
Right, okay.
So, right around 9:00,

1336
01:13:21.662 --> 01:13:23.142
she's gonna get
very angry with me.

1337
01:13:23.163 --> 01:13:25.582
Why is she gonna
get angry with you?

1338
01:13:25.666 --> 01:13:28.001
Well, because, George,
nice girls get angry

1339
01:13:28.085 --> 01:13:30.337
when, uh, guys
take advantage of 'em.

1340
01:13:31.296 --> 01:13:32.381
<font color=#FFFF00>(EXCLAIMS)</font>

1341
01:13:32.589 --> 01:13:34.591
Oh, you mean you're gonna
go touch her on her...

1342
01:13:34.675 --> 01:13:37.135
No. No, George, look.

1343
01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:39.930
It's just an act, right?

1344
01:13:40.222 --> 01:13:43.725
Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

1345
01:13:44.142 --> 01:13:47.354
You see us, uh,
struggling in the car.

1346
01:13:47.771 --> 01:13:50.941
You walk up, you open
the door and you say...

1347
01:13:52.567 --> 01:13:54.319
Your line, George.

1348
01:13:55.612 --> 01:13:56.780
Oh! Uh...

1349
01:13:57.447 --> 01:14:00.284
Hey, you, get your
damn hands off her!

1350
01:14:02.619 --> 01:14:03.954
You really think
I oughta swear?

1351
01:14:04.037 --> 01:14:05.038
Yes, definitely.

1352
01:14:05.122 --> 01:14:06.748
God damn it, George, swear.

1353
01:14:06.832 --> 01:14:08.834
Okay.
So, now, you come up.

1354
01:14:08.917 --> 01:14:10.043
You punch me in the stomach.

1355
01:14:10.127 --> 01:14:11.920
I'm out for the count,
right?

1356
01:14:12.004 --> 01:14:15.215
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

1357
01:14:15.299 --> 01:14:17.509
Oh, you make it sound
so easy.

1358
01:14:17.592 --> 01:14:20.053
I just...
I wish I wasn't so scared.

1359
01:14:20.137 --> 01:14:21.459
George, there's nothin'
to be scared of.

1360
01:14:21.471 --> 01:14:24.016
All it takes is a little
self-confidence.

1361
01:14:24.099 --> 01:14:26.810
You know, if you
put your mind to it,

1362
01:14:26.893 --> 01:14:28.352
you can accomplish anything.

Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future?

1368
01:14:45.578 --> 01:14:48.247
You know, Marty, I'm gonna
be very sad to see you go.

1369
01:14:48.331 --> 01:14:49.611
You've really made
a difference in my life.

1370
01:14:49.623 --> 01:14:51.751
You've given me
something to shoot for.

1371
01:14:51.834 --> 01:14:56.005
Just knowing that I'm gonna
be around to see 1985.

1372
01:14:56.088 --> 01:14:58.007
That I'm gonna succeed
in this!

1373
01:14:58.090 --> 01:15:01.635
That I'm gonna have a chance
to travel through time!

1374
01:15:07.099 --> 01:15:09.840
It's gonna be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you

1375
01:15:09.852 --> 01:15:12.813
about everything that's happened
in the past few days.

1376
01:15:12.897 --> 01:15:15.483
I'm really gonna
miss you, Marty.

1377
01:15:16.817 --> 01:15:18.652
I'm really gonna miss you.

1378
01:15:23.032 --> 01:15:24.200
Doc, about the future...

1379
01:15:24.283 --> 01:15:25.368
No!

1380
01:15:26.035 --> 01:15:28.371
Marty!
We've already agreed

1381
01:15:28.454 --> 01:15:29.818
that having information
about the future

1382
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:31.290
can be extremely dangerous.

1383
01:15:31.374 --> 01:15:32.875
Even if your
intentions are good,

1384
01:15:32.958 --> 01:15:34.919
it can backfire drastically.

1385
01:15:36.170 --> 01:15:37.410
Whatever you've got
to tell me,

1386
01:15:37.463 --> 01:15:40.549
I'll find out through
the natural course of time.

1387
01:15:41.592 --> 01:15:43.552

1388
01:15:44.303 --> 01:15:46.764

back in time"

"Marty"

1395

'Evening, Dr. Brown.
What's with the wire?

1396
01:16:15.876 --> 01:16:18.796
Oh, just a little
weather experiment.

1397
01:16:20.631 --> 01:16:21.632
Umm! Whatcha got under here?

1398
01:16:21.715 --> 01:16:22.716
No! No! Don't touch that!

1399
01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:25.594
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

1400

You, uh, got a permit for that?

1401

Of course I do.

1402
01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:39.859

I can find it here.

park for a while?

That's a great idea.
I'd love to park.

1407
01:17:39.876 --> 01:17:40.877
Huh?

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.671
Marty, I'm almost
18 years old.

1409
01:17:43.755 --> 01:17:45.673
It's not like I've never
parked before.

1410
01:17:46.466 --> 01:17:47.759
What?

1411
01:17:48.301 --> 01:17:51.304
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?

1412
01:17:51.387 --> 01:17:52.514
No.

01:17:53.556 --> 01:17:54.682
- No.

what are you doing?

I swiped it from
the old lady's liquor cabinet.

1416
01:18:04.734 --> 01:18:07.654
Yeah, well,
you shouldn't drink.

1417
01:18:07.737 --> 01:18:08.737
Why not?

1418
01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:09.822
Because you...

1419
01:18:10.573 --> 01:18:13.326
You might regret it
later in life.

1420
01:18:14.369 --> 01:18:16.287

the acceleration speed

1665
01:32:34.555 --> 01:32:37.183
from the moment
the lightning strikes,

1666
01:32:37.266 --> 01:32:41.771
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

Marty! You've gotta
come back with me!

1883
01:50:47.932 --> 01:50:49.142
Where?

1884
01:50:49.225 --> 01:50:50.393
Back to the future.

1885
01:50:55.023 --> 01:50:57.150
Wait a minute.
What are you doin', Doc?

1886
01:50:58.151 --> 01:50:59.235
I need fuel.

1887
01:51:02.697 --> 01:51:05.116
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.

1888
01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:07.307
No, no. no, Doc, I just got here,
okay? Jennifer's here.

1890
01:51:09.412 --> 01:51:12.665
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.

1891
01:51:12.749 --> 01:51:14.405
Wait a minute, Doc.
What, what are you talkin' about?

1892
01:51:14.417 --> 01:51:16.461
What happens to us
in the future?

1893
01:51:16.544 --> 01:51:18.296
Do we become assholes
or something?

1894
01:51:18.379 --> 01:51:19.506
No, no, no, no, no, Marty.

1895
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:21.341
Both you and Jennifer
turn out fine.

1896
01:51:21.424 --> 01:51:22.884
It's your kids, Marty.

1897
01:51:22.967 --> 01:51:25.220
Something has gotta be done
about your kids.

1899
01:51:31.601 --> 01:51:34.687
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't
have enough road to get up to 88.

1900
01:51:34.771 --> 01:51:38.942
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need... roads.
