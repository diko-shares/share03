How did you get the house back
from the bank?

1419
01:46:08,806 --> 01:46:10,141
I bought the bank.

1420
01:46:12,843 --> 01:46:14,376
The whole bank?

1421
01:46:14,378 --> 01:46:16,380
It's like a reflex with me.
I don't know.

What?

1423
01:46:21,785 --> 01:46:24,752
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1424
01:46:24,754 --> 01:46:27,422
But my foot's in the door.

1425
01:46:27,424 --> 01:46:30,225
Yeah, I got a recommendation
from a friend.

1426
01:46:30,227 --> 01:46:31,996
This is like a "job" job?

1427
01:46:32,728 --> 01:46:33,931
"Job" job.

1428
01:46:37,634 --> 01:46:38,936

Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.
