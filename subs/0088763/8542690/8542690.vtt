1
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.279
October is inventory time,

2
00:01:33.363 --> 00:01:34.989
so right now, Statler Toyota

3
00:01:35.073 --> 00:01:36.949
is making the best deals of the year

4
00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:39.202
on all 1985-model Toyotas.

5
00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.828
You won't find a better car

6
00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:44.207
at a better price with better
service anywhere in Hill Valley.

7
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:47.585
That's Statler Toyota
in downtown Hill Valley.

8
00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:53.549
The Senate is
expected to vote on this today.

9
00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:57.804
In other news, officials at the
Pacific Nuclear research facility

10
00:01:57.888 --> 00:02:00.556
have denied the rumor that
a case of missing plutonium

11
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.893
was in fact stolen from
their vault two weeks ago.

12
00:02:03.977 --> 00:02:06.437
A Libyan terrorist group
had claimed responsibility

13
00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:07.730
for the alleged theft.

14
00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:09.899
However, officials now attribute

15
00:02:09.983 --> 00:02:12.401
the discrepancy to a
simple clerical error.

16
00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:16.656
The FBI, which is investigating
the matter, had no comment.

17
00:02:58.448 --> 00:02:59.740
Hey, Doc?

18
00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:03.452
Doc?

19
00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:06.372
Hello! Anybody home?

20
00:03:06.748 --> 00:03:07.707
Einstein, come here, boy.

21
00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.377
What's going on? Oh, God.

22
00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:14.171
Oh, Jesus!

23
00:03:14.798 --> 00:03:18.050
That is disgusting.
Where the hell is he?

24
00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:39.298
Whoa!

25
00:04:42.177 --> 00:04:43.678
Rock 'n' roll.

26
00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.437
Yo. DOC: Marty, is that you?

27
00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:55.564
Hey. Hey, Doc. Where are you?

28
00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:56.816
Thank God I've found you.

29
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.318
Listen, can you meet me at
Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15?

30
00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:01.153
I made a major breakthrough,
and I'll need your assistance.

31
00:05:01.238 --> 00:05:02.446
Wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?

32
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:03.531
Yeah.

33
00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:05.282
Doc, what's going on?

34
00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:07.326
Where you been all week? Working.

35
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:08.786
Where's Einstein? Is he with you?

36
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.579
Yeah, he's right here.

37
00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:13.290
You know, Doc, you left
your equipment on all week.

38
00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:15.960
My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.

39
00:05:16.044 --> 00:05:17.503
You better not hook up to the amplifier.

40
00:05:17.587 --> 00:05:19.880
There's a slight
possibility of overload.

41
00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:22.341
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

42
00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:24.844
Good. I'll see you
tonight. Don't forget now.

43
00:05:24.928 --> 00:05:26.721
1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.

44
00:05:26.805 --> 00:05:27.847
Right.

45
00:05:34.604 --> 00:05:36.355
Are those my clocks I hear?

46
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.108
Yeah, it's 8:00.

47
00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:41.694
Perfect! My experiment worked!

48
00:05:41.778 --> 00:05:44.280
They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!

49
00:05:45.282 --> 00:05:47.283
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc.

50
00:05:47.868 --> 00:05:50.036
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

51
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.245
Precisely.

52
00:05:51.788 --> 00:05:54.707
Damn! I'm late for school.

53
00:06:54.768 --> 00:06:56.519
Jennifer. Marty, don't go this way.

54
00:06:56.603 --> 00:06:57.603
Strickland's looking for you.

55
00:06:57.687 --> 00:07:00.022
If you get caught, it'll
be four tardies in a row.

56
00:07:02.025 --> 00:07:04.318
All right, come on. I think we're safe.

57
00:07:04.402 --> 00:07:06.529
You know, this time it wasn't my fault.

58
00:07:06.613 --> 00:07:08.948
The doc set all his
clocks 25 minutes slow.

59
00:07:09.032 --> 00:07:10.282
Doc?

60
00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:13.744
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?

61
00:07:15.247 --> 00:07:17.331
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

62
00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:21.710
And one for you, McFly. I
believe that makes four in a row.

63
00:07:21.795 --> 00:07:24.755
Let me give you a nickel's
worth of free advice, young man.

64
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.008
This so-called Dr. Brown is
dangerous. He's a real nutcase.

65
00:07:28.093 --> 00:07:30.511
You hang around with him, you're
gonna end up in big trouble.

66
00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:31.887
Ooh. Yes, sir.

67
00:07:32.597 --> 00:07:36.183
You got a real attitude
problem, McFly. You're a slacker.

68
00:07:36.434 --> 00:07:38.102
You remind me of your
father when he went here.

69
00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:40.563
He was a slacker, too.

70
00:07:40.647 --> 00:07:42.731
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

71
00:07:42.816 --> 00:07:44.483
I noticed your band is on the roster

72
00:07:44.568 --> 00:07:46.569
for the dance auditions
after school today.

73
00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:49.071
Why even bother, McFly?
You don't have a chance.

74
00:07:49.156 --> 00:07:50.948
You're too much like your old man.

75
00:07:51.032 --> 00:07:53.284
No McFly ever amounted to anything

76
00:07:53.368 --> 00:07:55.077
in the history of Hill Valley.

77
00:07:57.038 --> 00:07:59.206
Yeah, well, history is gonna change.

78
00:08:01.334 --> 00:08:02.793
Next, please.

79
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:09.758
Okay, guys, let's rock 'n roll.

80
00:08:12.053 --> 00:08:13.387
All right.

81
00:08:14.222 --> 00:08:16.932
We're the... We're the Pinheads.

82
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.060
One, two, three.

83
00:08:39.664 --> 00:08:42.750
Okay, that's enough. Thank you, fellas.

84
00:08:43.501 --> 00:08:44.960
Hold it, fellas.

85
00:08:45.378 --> 00:08:47.713
I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.

86
00:08:48.465 --> 00:08:50.007
Next, please.

87
00:08:52.177 --> 00:08:54.511
Bring up the next group, please.

88
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.391
Re-elect
Mayor "Goldie" Wilson.

89
00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:01.477
Progress is his middle name.

90
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:03.646
"Too loud." I can't believe it.

91
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.357
I'm never gonna get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

92
00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:08.817
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

93
00:09:08.902 --> 00:09:11.320
I just don't think
I'm cut out for music.

94
00:09:11.404 --> 00:09:13.364
But you're good, Marty.
You're really good,

95
00:09:13.448 --> 00:09:15.241
and this audition
tape of yours is great.

96
00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:17.368
You've gotta send it in
to the record company.

97
00:09:17.494 --> 00:09:19.245
It's like Doc's always
saying. Yeah, I know. I know.

98
00:09:19.329 --> 00:09:20.371
"If you put your mind to it,

99
00:09:20.455 --> 00:09:22.957
"you can accomplish anything."

100
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:25.042
That's good advice, Marty.

101
00:09:25.126 --> 00:09:26.585
All right, okay, Jennifer.

102
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.629
What if I send in the tape
and they don't like it?

103
00:09:28.713 --> 00:09:30.631
What if they say I'm no good?

104
00:09:30.715 --> 00:09:33.008
What if they say, "Get out of
here, kid. You got no future"?

105
00:09:33.093 --> 00:09:36.303
I mean, I just don't think I
can take that kind of rejection.

106
00:09:36.388 --> 00:09:38.389
Jesus, I'm starting to
sound like my old man.

107
00:09:38.473 --> 00:09:40.224
Come on. He's not that
bad. Save the clock tower.

108
00:09:40.308 --> 00:09:43.852
At least he's letting you
borrow the car tomorrow night.

109
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:46.438
Check out that 4x4.

110
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.440
That is hot.

111
00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:49.775
Okay. Back her up.

112
00:09:49.859 --> 00:09:53.112
Someday, Jennifer. Someday.

113
00:09:53.571 --> 00:09:57.074
Wouldn't it be great to take
that truck up to the lake?

114
00:09:58.076 --> 00:10:01.078
Throw a couple of
sleeping bags in the back.

115
00:10:02.414 --> 00:10:04.373
Lie out underneath the stars.

116
00:10:04.457 --> 00:10:06.292
Stop it. What?

117
00:10:07.127 --> 00:10:09.753
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?

118
00:10:09.838 --> 00:10:11.046
No, get out of town.

119
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:13.882
My mom thinks I'm going
camping with the guys.

120
00:10:13.967 --> 00:10:15.551
Jennifer, my mother would freak out

121
00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:16.969
if she knew I was
going up there with you,

122
00:10:17.053 --> 00:10:19.221
and I'd get the standard lecture about

123
00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:21.682
how she never did that kind
of stuff when she was a kid.

124
00:10:21.766 --> 00:10:24.643
I mean, look, I think
the woman was born a nun.

125
00:10:24.728 --> 00:10:27.229
She's just trying to
keep you respectable.

126
00:10:27.314 --> 00:10:29.481
Well, she's not doing a very good job.

127
00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:30.774
Terrible.

128
00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:34.528
Save the clock tower.
Save the clock tower.

129
00:10:34.612 --> 00:10:38.657
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an
initiative to replace that clock.

130
00:10:38.742 --> 00:10:41.327
Thirty years ago, lightning
struck that clock tower

131
00:10:41.411 --> 00:10:43.162
and the clock hasn't run since.

132
00:10:43.246 --> 00:10:45.539
We at the Hill Valley
Preservation Society

133
00:10:45.623 --> 00:10:48.042
think it should be preserved
exactly the way it is

134
00:10:48.126 --> 00:10:49.877
as part of our history and heritage.

135
00:10:49.961 --> 00:10:51.003
There you go, lady. There's a quarter.

136
00:10:51.087 --> 00:10:52.129
Thank you.

137
00:10:52.213 --> 00:10:53.255
Don't forget to take a flyer.

138
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.340
Right.

139
00:10:54.424 --> 00:10:56.342
Save the clock tower!

140
00:10:58.011 --> 00:10:59.595
Where were we?

141
00:11:00.096 --> 00:11:01.180
Right about here.

142
00:11:01.264 --> 00:11:02.348
Jennifer!

143
00:11:05.435 --> 00:11:07.811
It's my dad. I've got to go. Right.

144
00:11:07.896 --> 00:11:09.355
I'll call you tonight.

145
00:11:09.439 --> 00:11:10.564
I'll be at my grandma's.

146
00:11:10.648 --> 00:11:13.067
Here, let me give you the number.

147
00:11:18.073 --> 00:11:19.114
Bye.

148
00:12:02.325 --> 00:12:05.327
Bravo,
Tango, Delta 6-2-9.

149
00:12:05.412 --> 00:12:08.497
Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.

150
00:12:10.917 --> 00:12:13.502
Perfect. Just perfect.

151
00:12:19.968 --> 00:12:22.136
I can't believe you'd loan me your car

152
00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.054
without telling me it had a blind spot.

153
00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:25.722
Blind spot? I could've been killed.

154
00:12:26.099 --> 00:12:28.434
Now, Biff, now, I never noticed

155
00:12:28.518 --> 00:12:32.521
that the car had any blind spot
before when I would drive it.

156
00:12:32.605 --> 00:12:34.022
Hi, Son.

157
00:12:34.107 --> 00:12:36.316
What, are you
blind, McFly? It's there.

158
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:38.277
How else do you explain
that wreck out there?

159
00:12:38.361 --> 00:12:41.363
Biff, can I assume

160
00:12:41.781 --> 00:12:44.825
that your insurance is
going to pay for the damage?

161
00:12:44.909 --> 00:12:47.202
My insurance? It's your car.

162
00:12:47.287 --> 00:12:48.495
Your insurance should pay for it.

163
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.122
I wanna know who's
going to pay for this?

164
00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:52.082
I spilled beer all over it
when the car smashed into me.

165
00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:53.250
Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

166
00:12:53.334 --> 00:12:54.334
Ah...

167
00:12:54.419 --> 00:12:56.378
And where's my reports?

168
00:12:56.463 --> 00:12:57.963
Well, I haven't finished those up yet,

169
00:12:58.047 --> 00:13:00.716
but I figured since
they weren't due till...

170
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.719
Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh?

171
00:13:04.429 --> 00:13:06.722
Think, McFly. Think! All right.

172
00:13:06.806 --> 00:13:08.891
I got to have time to get them retyped.

173
00:13:08.975 --> 00:13:10.225
Do you realize what would happen

174
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.103
if I hand in my reports
in your handwriting?

175
00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:14.730
I'll get fired.

176
00:13:14.814 --> 00:13:17.608
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

177
00:13:17.692 --> 00:13:19.610
Would you? Of course not, Biff.

178
00:13:19.694 --> 00:13:22.154
Now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

179
00:13:22.238 --> 00:13:25.073
Now, look. I'll finish
those reports on up tonight,

180
00:13:25.158 --> 00:13:27.993
and I'll run them on over
first thing tomorrow, all right?

181
00:13:28.077 --> 00:13:29.912
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday.

182
00:13:29.996 --> 00:13:31.246
McFly, your shoe's untied.

183
00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:32.331
Oh.

184
00:13:32.415 --> 00:13:34.791
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

185
00:13:34.876 --> 00:13:36.752
Got the place fixed
up nice, though, McFly.

186
00:13:39.047 --> 00:13:41.089
I have your car towed
all the way to your house

187
00:13:41.174 --> 00:13:42.841
and all you got for me is lite beer?

188
00:13:50.808 --> 00:13:53.268
What are you looking at, butthead?

189
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:57.314
Say hi to your mom for me.

190
00:14:00.109 --> 00:14:02.110
I know what you're going to say, Son,

191
00:14:02.195 --> 00:14:04.821
and you're right. You're right.

192
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.910
But Biff just happens
to be my supervisor,

193
00:14:11.204 --> 00:14:14.623
And I'm afraid I'm just not
very good at confrontations.

194
00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:17.501
But the car, Dad.

195
00:14:19.295 --> 00:14:21.964
I mean, he wrecked it. He totaled it.

196
00:14:22.882 --> 00:14:24.967
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.

197
00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:27.219
Do you have any idea how
important this was to me?

198
00:14:27.303 --> 00:14:28.345
Do you have any clue?

199
00:14:28.429 --> 00:14:31.098
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...

200
00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:33.100
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:33.393 --> 00:14:35.769
Believe me, Marty, you're better off

202
00:14:35.853 --> 00:14:38.772
without having to worry
about all the aggravation

203
00:14:38.856 --> 00:14:42.109
and headaches of playing at that dance.

204
00:14:42.193 --> 00:14:43.860
He's absolutely right, Marty.

205
00:14:43.945 --> 00:14:46.446
The last thing you need is headaches.

206
00:14:54.289 --> 00:14:57.916
Kids, we're going to have to
eat this cake by ourselves.

207
00:14:58.501 --> 00:15:00.877
Your Uncle Joey didn't
make parole again.

208
00:15:03.256 --> 00:15:06.592
I think it would be nice if
you all dropped him a line.

209
00:15:06.676 --> 00:15:08.427
Uncle "Jailbird" Joey?

210
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:09.970
He's your brother, Mom.

211
00:15:10.054 --> 00:15:13.890
Yeah. I think it's a major
embarrassment, having an uncle in prison.

212
00:15:14.309 --> 00:15:16.184
We all make mistakes in life, children.

213
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:17.978
God damn it. I'm late.

214
00:15:18.062 --> 00:15:19.730
David, watch your mouth!

215
00:15:19.814 --> 00:15:22.399
You come here and kiss your
mother before you go. Come here.

216
00:15:22.483 --> 00:15:25.569
Come on, Mom. Make it
fast. I'll miss my bus.

217
00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:27.529
See you later, Pop.

218
00:15:27.614 --> 00:15:30.365
Time to change that oil.

219
00:15:33.494 --> 00:15:37.039
Hey, Marty. I'm not
your answering service.

220
00:15:37.123 --> 00:15:39.541
While you were outside
pouting over the car,

221
00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:41.877
Jennifer Parker called you twice.

222
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:43.378
I don't like her, Marty.

223
00:15:43.463 --> 00:15:46.590
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

224
00:15:46.674 --> 00:15:49.551
Oh, Mother, there's nothing
wrong with calling a boy.

225
00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:53.138
I think it's terrible.
Girls chasing boys.

226
00:15:53.556 --> 00:15:56.892
When I was your age, I never
chased a boy or called a boy

227
00:15:56.976 --> 00:15:59.519
or sat in a parked car with a boy.

228
00:16:00.188 --> 00:16:03.065
Then how am I supposed
to ever meet anybody?

229
00:16:03.733 --> 00:16:06.193
Well, it'll just happen.

230
00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:07.778
Like the way I met your father.

231
00:16:08.655 --> 00:16:11.573
That was so stupid. Grandpa
hit him with the car.

232
00:16:12.075 --> 00:16:13.825
It was meant to be.

233
00:16:14.702 --> 00:16:18.205
Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him,

234
00:16:18.289 --> 00:16:19.956
then none of you would have been born.

235
00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:21.333
Yeah, well.

236
00:16:21.918 --> 00:16:23.669
I still don't understand
what Dad was doing

237
00:16:23.753 --> 00:16:25.170
in the middle of the street.

238
00:16:25.254 --> 00:16:27.714
What was it, George? Bird-watching?

239
00:16:27.799 --> 00:16:29.925
What, Lorraine? What?

240
00:16:30.426 --> 00:16:33.345
Anyway, your Grandpa
hit him with the car

241
00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:35.138
and brought him into the house.

242
00:16:36.516 --> 00:16:38.433
He seemed so helpless,

243
00:16:41.187 --> 00:16:44.189
like a little lost puppy, and
my heart just went out to him.

244
00:16:44.273 --> 00:16:47.442
Yeah, Mom, we know. You've
told us this story a million times.

245
00:16:47.527 --> 00:16:48.860
You felt sorry for him,

246
00:16:48.945 --> 00:16:50.404
so you decided to go with him

247
00:16:50.488 --> 00:16:52.030
to the Fish Under the Sea dance.

248
00:16:52.115 --> 00:16:55.283
No. It was the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

249
00:16:56.119 --> 00:16:59.246
Our first date. I'll never forget it.

250
00:16:59.706 --> 00:17:02.374
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember, George?

251
00:17:06.045 --> 00:17:09.965
Your father kissed me for the very
first time on that dance floor.

252
00:17:11.884 --> 00:17:14.052
It was then that I realized

253
00:17:14.137 --> 00:17:17.013
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

254
00:17:46.043 --> 00:17:47.085
Hello.

255
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:48.628
Marty, you didn't
fall asleep, did you?

256
00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:50.172
Doc.

257
00:17:51.215 --> 00:17:53.633
No. No, don't be silly.

258
00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.970
Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.

259
00:17:57.054 --> 00:17:59.890
Can you stop by my place and pick
it up on your way to the mall?

260
00:17:59.974 --> 00:18:02.726
Yeah. I'm on my way.

261
00:18:26.918 --> 00:18:29.127
Einstein! Hey, Einstein,
where's the doc, boy? Huh?

262
00:19:24.267 --> 00:19:25.392
Doc!

263
00:19:26.686 --> 00:19:28.019
Marty! You made it!

264
00:19:28.104 --> 00:19:29.145
Yeah.

265
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.314
Welcome to my latest
experiment. This is the big one,

266
00:19:31.399 --> 00:19:33.275
the one I've been
waiting for all my life.

267
00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:34.818
Well, it's a DeLorean...

268
00:19:34.902 --> 00:19:36.736
Bear with me, Marty. All your
questions will be answered.

269
00:19:36.821 --> 00:19:38.154
Roll tape and we'll proceed.

270
00:19:38.239 --> 00:19:39.281
Doc,

271
00:19:39.365 --> 00:19:40.365
is that a DEVO suit?

272
00:19:40.449 --> 00:19:41.741
Never mind that now.

273
00:19:41.826 --> 00:19:42.909
Not now.

274
00:19:42.994 --> 00:19:44.035
All right. I'm ready.

275
00:19:44.662 --> 00:19:46.371
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

276
00:19:46.455 --> 00:19:48.623
I'm standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.

277
00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:52.294
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.,

278
00:19:52.378 --> 00:19:54.629
and this is temporal
experiment number one.

279
00:19:54.714 --> 00:19:56.756
Come on, Einie. Hey,
hey, boy, get in there.

280
00:19:56.841 --> 00:19:59.134
That a boy! In you go. Sit down.

281
00:20:00.094 --> 00:20:01.595
Put your seat belt on. That's it.

282
00:20:06.726 --> 00:20:07.767
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

283
00:20:07.852 --> 00:20:09.227
Okay.

284
00:20:10.563 --> 00:20:13.189
Please note that Einstein's clock

285
00:20:13.274 --> 00:20:16.192
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

286
00:20:16.319 --> 00:20:17.861
Got it? Right. Check, Doc.

287
00:20:17.945 --> 00:20:18.945
Good.

288
00:20:21.115 --> 00:20:24.075
Have a good trip,
Einstein. Watch your head.

289
00:20:29.749 --> 00:20:31.082
You got that thing hooked up to the car?

290
00:20:32.335 --> 00:20:33.335
Watch this.

291
00:20:33.419 --> 00:20:35.712
Yeah. Okay. Got it.

292
00:20:39.842 --> 00:20:41.009
Jesus!

293
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.557
Not me! The car! The car!

294
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:07.202
If my calculations are correct,

295
00:21:07.745 --> 00:21:10.372
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour

296
00:21:10.831 --> 00:21:12.874
you're going to see some serious shit.

297
00:21:48.869 --> 00:21:50.578
Watch this. Watch this.

298
00:22:08.681 --> 00:22:11.016
What did I tell you?

299
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.561
88 miles per hour!

300
00:22:17.648 --> 00:22:19.149
The temporal displacement occurred

301
00:22:19.233 --> 00:22:22.569
exactly 1:20 a.m. And zero seconds!

302
00:22:24.321 --> 00:22:26.197
Jesus Christ!

303
00:22:26.282 --> 00:22:28.700
Jesus Christ, Doc! You
disintegrated Einstein!

304
00:22:28.784 --> 00:22:31.411
Calm down, Marty. I didn't
disintegrate anything.

305
00:22:31.495 --> 00:22:36.207
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

306
00:22:36.292 --> 00:22:37.667
Then where the hell are they?

307
00:22:37.752 --> 00:22:39.252
The appropriate question is,

308
00:22:39.336 --> 00:22:40.879
"When the hell are they?"

309
00:22:40.963 --> 00:22:45.425
You see, Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

310
00:22:45.926 --> 00:22:48.845
I sent him into the future.

311
00:22:49.597 --> 00:22:51.973
One minute into the future, to be exact.

312
00:22:52.058 --> 00:22:55.268
At precisely 1:21 a.m. And zero seconds,

313
00:22:55.352 --> 00:22:58.229
we shall catch up with
him and the time machine.

314
00:23:01.776 --> 00:23:03.777
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc.

315
00:23:05.446 --> 00:23:08.323
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine

316
00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:10.658
out of a DeLorean?

317
00:23:10.743 --> 00:23:11.785
The way I see it,

318
00:23:11.869 --> 00:23:13.745
if you're going to build
a time machine into a car,

319
00:23:13.829 --> 00:23:15.663
why not do it with some style?

320
00:23:15.748 --> 00:23:18.917
Besides, the stainless-steel
construction made the flux dispersal...

321
00:23:20.544 --> 00:23:21.961
Look out!

322
00:24:06.841 --> 00:24:07.966
What? Is it hot?

323
00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.759
It's cold. Damn cold.

324
00:24:13.472 --> 00:24:15.390
Einstein, you little devil!

325
00:24:17.893 --> 00:24:19.686
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute

326
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.147
behind mine and still ticking!

327
00:24:25.651 --> 00:24:26.860
He's all right. He's fine.

328
00:24:26.944 --> 00:24:29.279
And he's completely unaware
that anything happened.

329
00:24:29.363 --> 00:24:31.990
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

330
00:24:32.074 --> 00:24:34.659
That's why his watch is
exactly one minute behind mine.

331
00:24:34.743 --> 00:24:35.827
He skipped over that minute

332
00:24:35.911 --> 00:24:37.787
to instantly arrive
at this moment in time.

333
00:24:37.872 --> 00:24:39.706
Come here. I'll show you how it works.

334
00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:40.915
All right.

335
00:24:42.585 --> 00:24:45.336
First, you turn the time circuits on.

336
00:24:49.383 --> 00:24:50.717
This readout tells
you where you're going.

337
00:24:50.801 --> 00:24:52.010
This one tells you where you are.

338
00:24:52.094 --> 00:24:53.595
This one tells you where you were.

339
00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:56.014
You input your destination
time on this keypad.

340
00:24:56.098 --> 00:24:57.348
Say you want to see the signing

341
00:24:57.433 --> 00:24:59.976
of the Declaration of Independence.

342
00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.063
Or witness the birth of Christ.

343
00:25:06.859 --> 00:25:09.485
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

344
00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.280
November 5th, 1955.

345
00:25:16.118 --> 00:25:20.371
Yes, of course. November 5th, 1955.

346
00:25:21.332 --> 00:25:22.957
What? I don't get it. What happened?

347
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:28.004
That was the day I invented time
travel. I remember it vividly.

348
00:25:28.631 --> 00:25:30.673
I was standing on the edge
of my toilet, hanging a clock.

349
00:25:30.758 --> 00:25:31.883
The porcelain was wet. I slipped,

350
00:25:31.967 --> 00:25:33.509
hit my head on the edge of the sink,

351
00:25:33.594 --> 00:25:35.637
and when I came to, I had a revelation,

352
00:25:35.721 --> 00:25:39.057
a vision, a picture in my
head, a picture of this.

353
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:44.479
This is what makes time travel
possible. The flux capacitor.

354
00:25:45.147 --> 00:25:46.356
Flux capacitor?

355
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.900
It's taken me almost 30 years
and my entire family fortune

356
00:25:48.984 --> 00:25:51.402
to realize the vision of that day.

357
00:25:51.487 --> 00:25:53.738
My God, has it been that long?

358
00:25:54.406 --> 00:25:57.242
Things have certainly
changed around here.

359
00:25:58.202 --> 00:26:00.078
I remember when this was all farmland

360
00:26:00.162 --> 00:26:02.288
as far as the eye could see.

361
00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.000
Old man Peabody owned all of this.

362
00:26:07.253 --> 00:26:10.838
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

363
00:26:14.969 --> 00:26:18.429
This is heavy-duty, Doc. This is great.

364
00:26:18.889 --> 00:26:21.432
Does it run on regular
unleaded gasoline?

365
00:26:21.517 --> 00:26:23.101
Unfortunately, no. It requires something

366
00:26:23.185 --> 00:26:25.311
with a little more kick. Plutonium.

367
00:26:25.771 --> 00:26:27.647
Plutonium. Wait a minute.

368
00:26:27.731 --> 00:26:30.108
Are you telling me that
this sucker is nuclear?

369
00:26:30.192 --> 00:26:32.193
Hey, hey, hey! Keep
rolling. Keep rolling there.

370
00:26:32.278 --> 00:26:34.112
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,

371
00:26:34.196 --> 00:26:35.405
but I need a nuclear reaction

372
00:26:35.489 --> 00:26:37.949
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts
of electricity I need.

373
00:26:38.033 --> 00:26:41.619
Doc, you don't just walk into
a store and buy plutonium.

374
00:26:42.204 --> 00:26:43.871
Did you rip that off?

375
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.626
Of course. From a group
of Libyan nationalists.

376
00:26:48.711 --> 00:26:49.919
They wanted me to build them a bomb,

377
00:26:50.004 --> 00:26:52.463
so I took their plutonium and, in
turn, gave them a shoddy bomb casing

378
00:26:52.548 --> 00:26:54.257
full of used pinball machine parts.

379
00:26:54.383 --> 00:26:56.301
Come on. Let's get you
a radiation suit. Jesus!

380
00:26:56.385 --> 00:26:57.760
We must prepare to reload.

381
00:27:26.915 --> 00:27:29.375
It's safe now. Everything's lead-lined.

382
00:27:31.295 --> 00:27:33.421
Don't you lose those tapes now.

383
00:27:33.505 --> 00:27:34.922
I need that as a record.

384
00:27:35.507 --> 00:27:37.884
Let's put this back here. There we go.

385
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.013
I almost forgot my luggage.

386
00:27:42.097 --> 00:27:44.849
Who knows if they've got
cotton underwear in the future?

387
00:27:44.933 --> 00:27:46.225
I'm allergic to all synthetics.

388
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:47.935
The future?

389
00:27:48.729 --> 00:27:49.729
That's where you're going?

390
00:27:49.813 --> 00:27:51.356
That's right, 25 years into the future.

391
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.484
I've always dreamed of seeing the
future, looking beyond my years,

392
00:27:54.568 --> 00:27:56.694
seeing the progress of mankind.

393
00:27:56.779 --> 00:27:57.987
Why not?

394
00:27:58.072 --> 00:28:01.866
I'll also be able to see who
wins the next 25 World Series.

395
00:28:02.242 --> 00:28:03.368
Doc.

396
00:28:03.452 --> 00:28:04.494
Huh?

397
00:28:04.661 --> 00:28:07.080
Look me up when you get there.

398
00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.333
Indeed, I will. Roll 'em.

399
00:28:16.673 --> 00:28:19.133
I, Dr. Emmett Brown,

400
00:28:20.719 --> 00:28:23.596
am about to embark on
an historic journey.

401
00:28:25.516 --> 00:28:27.058
What am I thinking of?

402
00:28:27.142 --> 00:28:29.644
I almost forgot to
bring extra plutonium.

403
00:28:29.728 --> 00:28:32.271
How did I ever expect to get
back? One pellet, one trip.

404
00:28:32.356 --> 00:28:33.981
I must be out of my mind.

405
00:28:36.944 --> 00:28:38.611
What is it, Einie?

406
00:28:47.079 --> 00:28:48.621
Oh, my God.

407
00:28:48.705 --> 00:28:51.499
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

408
00:28:51.583 --> 00:28:52.667
Run for it, Marty!

409
00:28:52.751 --> 00:28:53.793
Who? Who?

410
00:28:54.253 --> 00:28:56.671
Who do you think? The Libyans!

411
00:28:59.967 --> 00:29:01.467
Holy shit!

412
00:29:05.514 --> 00:29:07.348
I'll draw their fire!

413
00:29:15.315 --> 00:29:16.357
Doc, wait!

414
00:29:30.956 --> 00:29:32.039
No!

415
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:34.834
You bastard!

416
00:29:53.687 --> 00:29:54.979
Go! Damn Soviet gun.

417
00:30:00.986 --> 00:30:02.028
Go!

418
00:30:42.903 --> 00:30:45.238
Come on! Move, damn it!

419
00:30:46.657 --> 00:30:47.990
Jesus!

420
00:31:08.136 --> 00:31:09.595
Holy shit!

421
00:31:10.347 --> 00:31:13.057
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

422
00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.236
What is it? What is it, Pa?

423
00:32:07.946 --> 00:32:11.240
Looks like an airplane without wings.

424
00:32:11.783 --> 00:32:14.619
That ain't no airplane. Look.

425
00:32:35.682 --> 00:32:36.932
Children!

426
00:32:37.017 --> 00:32:38.351
Listen... Whoa.

427
00:32:51.031 --> 00:32:52.239
Hello?

428
00:32:55.369 --> 00:32:56.744
Excuse me.

429
00:33:00.165 --> 00:33:01.415
Sorry about your barn.

430
00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:08.464
It's already mutated
into human form! Shoot it!

431
00:33:10.384 --> 00:33:12.718
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!

432
00:33:16.932 --> 00:33:18.099
Get away!

433
00:33:19.351 --> 00:33:20.434
Hold it.

434
00:33:20.811 --> 00:33:22.395
Shoot it, Pa!

435
00:33:24.815 --> 00:33:27.858
My pine! Why you...

436
00:33:29.903 --> 00:33:33.322
You space bastard! You killed our pine!

437
00:33:37.703 --> 00:33:39.662
All right. All right. Okay, McFly.

438
00:33:39.746 --> 00:33:41.872
Get a grip on yourself.
It's all a dream.

439
00:33:41.957 --> 00:33:44.750
It's just a very intense dream.

440
00:34:28.003 --> 00:34:29.253
Listen, you got to help me.

441
00:34:29.337 --> 00:34:31.630
Don't stop, Wilbur! Don't!

442
00:34:33.675 --> 00:34:34.675
It can't be.

443
00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:42.099
This is nuts.

444
00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:48.147
Come on.

445
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:50.441
Perfect.

446
00:36:45.849 --> 00:36:49.393
Remember, fellow
citizens, the future is in your hands.

447
00:36:49.477 --> 00:36:53.272
If you believe in progress,
re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

448
00:36:53.356 --> 00:36:55.399
Progress is his middle name.

449
00:36:55.483 --> 00:36:58.068
Mayor Red Thomas' progress platform

450
00:36:58.153 --> 00:37:00.696
means more jobs, better education,

451
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.574
bigger civic improvements
and lower taxes.

452
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:07.661
On election day, cast your
vote for a proven leader.

453
00:37:07.746 --> 00:37:10.080
Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

454
00:37:13.376 --> 00:37:15.544
This has got to be a dream.

455
00:37:32.395 --> 00:37:35.314
Hey, kid. What'd you do? Jump ship?

456
00:37:35.398 --> 00:37:36.398
What?

457
00:37:36.483 --> 00:37:38.150
What's with the life preserver?

458
00:37:43.114 --> 00:37:45.407
I just want to use the phone.

459
00:37:45.492 --> 00:37:46.700
Yeah, it's in the back.

460
00:37:49.621 --> 00:37:50.955
Brown.

461
00:37:53.333 --> 00:37:54.750
Great. You're alive.

462
00:38:06.721 --> 00:38:08.055
Come on.

463
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.356
Do you know where 1640 Riverside...

464
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.067
Are you going to order something, kid?

465
00:38:21.695 --> 00:38:24.029
Yeah. Give me a Tab.

466
00:38:24.906 --> 00:38:27.324
Tab? I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

467
00:38:27.409 --> 00:38:29.493
Right. Give me a Pepsi Free.

468
00:38:29.577 --> 00:38:32.329
You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're going to pay for it.

469
00:38:32.414 --> 00:38:35.624
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, okay?

470
00:38:35.709 --> 00:38:37.710
Something without sugar.

471
00:38:45.093 --> 00:38:46.552
Hey, McFly.

472
00:38:48.972 --> 00:38:51.265
What do you think you're doing?

473
00:38:51.558 --> 00:38:52.641
Biff.

474
00:38:52.892 --> 00:38:55.394
I'm talking to you,
McFly, you Irish bug!

475
00:38:55.478 --> 00:38:57.646
Hey, Biff. Hey, guys. How are you doing?

476
00:38:57.731 --> 00:38:59.481
You got my homework finished, McFly?

477
00:39:00.108 --> 00:39:02.818
Well, actually, I figured since
it wasn't due till Monday...

478
00:39:02.902 --> 00:39:04.695
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

479
00:39:06.281 --> 00:39:08.157
Think, McFly. Think! Okay.

480
00:39:08.241 --> 00:39:10.117
I got to have time to recopy it.

481
00:39:10.201 --> 00:39:11.368
You realize what would happen

482
00:39:11.453 --> 00:39:13.954
if I hand in my homework
in your handwriting?

483
00:39:14.039 --> 00:39:15.748
I'll get kicked out of school.

484
00:39:15.832 --> 00:39:18.292
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

485
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:21.211
Would you?

486
00:39:21.296 --> 00:39:22.337
Now, of course not, Biff.

487
00:39:22.422 --> 00:39:24.339
No. I wouldn't want that to happen.

488
00:39:24.424 --> 00:39:25.966
What are you looking at, butthead?

489
00:39:26.051 --> 00:39:28.385
Biff, get a load of this
guy's life preserver.

490
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:30.179
Dork thinks he's going to drown.

491
00:39:30.263 --> 00:39:32.556
How about my homework, McFly?

492
00:39:33.266 --> 00:39:36.560
Okay, Biff. Well, I'll
finish that on up tonight

493
00:39:36.644 --> 00:39:39.938
and then I'll bring it over
first thing tomorrow morning.

494
00:39:40.023 --> 00:39:41.565
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.

495
00:39:41.649 --> 00:39:42.941
Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied!

496
00:39:44.152 --> 00:39:46.195
Don't be so gullible, McFly. Okay.

497
00:39:46.279 --> 00:39:47.362
I don't want to see you in here again.

498
00:39:47.447 --> 00:39:50.157
Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

499
00:40:11.971 --> 00:40:12.971
What?

500
00:40:13.056 --> 00:40:14.348
You're George McFly.

501
00:40:14.891 --> 00:40:16.266
Yeah. Who are you?

502
00:40:16.351 --> 00:40:17.976
Say! Why do you let those boys

503
00:40:18.061 --> 00:40:19.561
push you around like that for?

504
00:40:19.646 --> 00:40:20.938
Well, they're bigger than me.

505
00:40:21.022 --> 00:40:23.649
Stand tall, boy. Have
some respect for yourself.

506
00:40:23.733 --> 00:40:25.943
Don't you know, if you let
people walk over you now,

507
00:40:26.027 --> 00:40:28.112
they'll be walking over you
for the rest of your life.

508
00:40:28.196 --> 00:40:29.613
Look at me. You think I'm gonna

509
00:40:29.697 --> 00:40:31.365
spend the rest of my
life in this slop house?

510
00:40:31.449 --> 00:40:33.242
Watch it, Goldie. No, sir!

511
00:40:33.326 --> 00:40:34.535
I'm gonna make something of myself.

512
00:40:34.619 --> 00:40:35.828
I'm going to night school,

513
00:40:35.912 --> 00:40:38.122
and one day, I'm going to be somebody.

514
00:40:38.206 --> 00:40:40.082
That's right. He's going to be mayor.

515
00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:41.542
Yeah, I'm...

516
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.585
Mayor!

517
00:40:44.337 --> 00:40:48.257
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.

518
00:40:48.341 --> 00:40:49.842
A colored mayor. That'll be the day.

519
00:40:49.926 --> 00:40:52.261
You wait and see, Mr.
Caruthers. I will be mayor.

520
00:40:52.345 --> 00:40:54.638
I'll be the most powerful
man in Hill Valley,

521
00:40:54.722 --> 00:40:56.515
and I'm going to clean up this town.

522
00:40:56.599 --> 00:40:59.560
Good. You can start
by sweeping the floor.

523
00:41:02.105 --> 00:41:06.233
Mayor Goldie Wilson. I
like the sound of that.

524
00:41:18.746 --> 00:41:22.166
Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!

525
00:41:53.448 --> 00:41:55.490
He's a peeping Tom.

526
00:42:01.164 --> 00:42:02.206
Dad!

527
00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.054
Hey, wait a minute. Wait
a minute. Who are you?

528
00:42:19.057 --> 00:42:21.892
Stella! Another one of these damn kids

529
00:42:21.976 --> 00:42:23.352
jumped in front of my car!

530
00:42:24.354 --> 00:42:27.522
Come on out here! Help
me take him in the house!

531
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:35.030
Mom? That you?

532
00:42:36.074 --> 00:42:39.117
There, there, now. Just relax.

533
00:42:41.746 --> 00:42:44.790
You've been asleep for
almost nine hours now.

534
00:42:46.626 --> 00:42:49.086
I had a horrible nightmare.

535
00:42:50.129 --> 00:42:54.675
I dreamed that I went back
in time. It was terrible.

536
00:42:55.927 --> 00:42:57.052
Well,

537
00:42:57.679 --> 00:43:01.139
you're safe and sound
now, back in good old 1955.

538
00:43:02.225 --> 00:43:03.642
1955?

539
00:43:08.439 --> 00:43:11.233
You're my... You're my...

540
00:43:11.317 --> 00:43:12.484
My name is Lorraine.

541
00:43:13.945 --> 00:43:15.112
Lorraine Baines.

542
00:43:15.196 --> 00:43:16.280
Yeah.

543
00:43:17.407 --> 00:43:20.075
But you're... You're so...

544
00:43:20.618 --> 00:43:23.662
You're so thin!

545
00:43:24.038 --> 00:43:27.457
Just relax, Calvin. You got
a big bruise on your head.

546
00:43:31.587 --> 00:43:33.588
Where are my pants?

547
00:43:33.673 --> 00:43:36.758
Over there, on my hope chest.

548
00:43:38.636 --> 00:43:41.263
I've never seen purple
underwear before, Calvin.

549
00:43:42.056 --> 00:43:44.850
Calvin? Why do you
keep calling me Calvin?

550
00:43:44.934 --> 00:43:47.853
Well, that is your name,
isn't it? Calvin Klein?

551
00:43:48.396 --> 00:43:51.064
It's written all over your underwear.

552
00:43:51.441 --> 00:43:53.859
Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?

553
00:43:54.193 --> 00:43:57.904
No, actually, people call me Marty.

554
00:43:58.239 --> 00:43:59.364
Oh.

555
00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:02.409
Pleased to meet you, Calvin.

556
00:44:03.328 --> 00:44:04.703
Marty.

557
00:44:06.122 --> 00:44:07.497
Klein.

558
00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.173
Do you mind if I sit here?

559
00:44:16.257 --> 00:44:17.466
No. Fine.

560
00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:19.926
No. Good. Fine. Good.

561
00:44:21.929 --> 00:44:24.139
That's a big bruise you have there.

562
00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.185
Lorraine, are you up there?

563
00:44:28.269 --> 00:44:30.270
Oh, my God! It's my mother!

564
00:44:30.355 --> 00:44:33.315
Quick! Put your pants back on!

565
00:44:41.574 --> 00:44:44.368
So, tell me, Marty,
how long have you been in port?

566
00:44:44.452 --> 00:44:45.452
Excuse me?

567
00:44:45.536 --> 00:44:46.536
I guessed you're a sailor.

568
00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:48.789
That's why you wear that life preserver.

569
00:44:48.873 --> 00:44:50.374
Coast Guard.

570
00:44:50.458 --> 00:44:52.376
Sam, here's the young man

571
00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.877
you hit with your car out there.

572
00:44:53.961 --> 00:44:55.045
He's all right. Thank God.

573
00:44:55.129 --> 00:44:57.339
What were you doing in the middle
of the street, a kid your age?

574
00:44:57.423 --> 00:44:59.341
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

575
00:44:59.425 --> 00:45:01.009
Sam, you quit fiddling with that thing.

576
00:45:01.094 --> 00:45:02.511
Come in here to dinner.

577
00:45:02.595 --> 00:45:04.596
Now, let's see. You
already know Lorraine.

578
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.517
This is Milton, this
is Sally, that's Toby,

579
00:45:08.601 --> 00:45:11.812
and over there in the
playpen is little baby Joey.

580
00:45:13.481 --> 00:45:15.482
So, you're my uncle Joey.

581
00:45:16.359 --> 00:45:18.735
Better get used to these bars, kid.

582
00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.948
Yes. Joey just loves
being in his playpen.

583
00:45:23.408 --> 00:45:24.741
He cries whenever we take him out,

584
00:45:24.826 --> 00:45:26.827
so we just leave him
in there all the time.

585
00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:29.121
Well, Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

586
00:45:29.205 --> 00:45:31.415
Listen, I really ought to...

587
00:45:31.499 --> 00:45:32.707
Sit here, Marty.

588
00:45:33.292 --> 00:45:35.168
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing

589
00:45:35.253 --> 00:45:37.712
and come in here and eat your dinner.

590
00:45:39.507 --> 00:45:41.258
Look at it roll.

591
00:45:41.342 --> 00:45:43.385
Now we can watch Jackie
Gleason while we eat.

592
00:45:52.353 --> 00:45:54.146
It's our first television set.

593
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:55.856
Dad just picked it up today.

594
00:45:56.732 --> 00:45:58.817
Do you have a television?

595
00:45:58.901 --> 00:46:01.778
Well, yeah. You know
we have two of them.

596
00:46:01.863 --> 00:46:04.656
Wow! You must be rich.

597
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.283
Oh, honey, he's teasing you.

598
00:46:06.367 --> 00:46:08.827
Nobody has two television sets.

599
00:46:13.875 --> 00:46:16.168
Hey. Hey, I've seen this one.

600
00:46:16.252 --> 00:46:17.669
I've seen this one! This is a classic.

601
00:46:17.753 --> 00:46:21.047
This is where Ralph dresses
up as a man from space.

602
00:46:21.132 --> 00:46:24.551
What do you mean, you've
seen this? It's brand-new.

603
00:46:24.635 --> 00:46:26.970
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

604
00:46:27.722 --> 00:46:29.514
What's a rerun?

605
00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:30.724
You'll find out.

606
00:46:31.225 --> 00:46:35.395
You know, Marty, you look so
familiar to me. Do I know your mother?

607
00:46:36.814 --> 00:46:38.857
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

608
00:46:38.941 --> 00:46:40.525
Oh, then I
want to give her a call.

609
00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:42.277
I don't want her to worry about you.

610
00:46:42.361 --> 00:46:43.737
You can't.

611
00:46:44.614 --> 00:46:47.908
That is, nobody's home.

612
00:46:49.202 --> 00:46:50.285
Oh.

613
00:46:50.661 --> 00:46:51.786
Yet.

614
00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:53.413
Oh.

615
00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.918
Listen, do you know
where Riverside Drive is?

616
00:46:58.002 --> 00:46:59.503
It's on the other end of town.

617
00:46:59.587 --> 00:47:02.130
A block past Maple. East end of town.

618
00:47:02.215 --> 00:47:03.590
Wait a minute, a block past Maple.

619
00:47:03.674 --> 00:47:06.176
That's John F. Kennedy Drive.

620
00:47:07.053 --> 00:47:09.054
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

621
00:47:09.138 --> 00:47:10.430
Mother?

622
00:47:11.057 --> 00:47:13.683
With Marty's parents out of town,

623
00:47:14.227 --> 00:47:16.645
don't you think he
ought to spend the night?

624
00:47:16.729 --> 00:47:19.147
I mean, after all, Dad almost
killed him with the car.

625
00:47:19.357 --> 00:47:21.316
That's true, Marty.

626
00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.026
I think maybe you
should spend the night.

627
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.653
I think you're our responsibility.

628
00:47:24.737 --> 00:47:26.363
Gee, I don't know.

629
00:47:26.447 --> 00:47:28.198
And he can sleep in my room.

630
00:47:28.908 --> 00:47:30.867
I gotta go! I gotta go!

631
00:47:30.952 --> 00:47:32.369
Thanks very much. It was wonderful.

632
00:47:32.453 --> 00:47:36.790
You were all great. See
you all later. Much later.

633
00:47:41.254 --> 00:47:44.047
He's a very strange young man.

634
00:47:44.131 --> 00:47:45.257
He's an idiot.

635
00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:49.302
Comes from upbringing. His
parents are probably idiots, too.

636
00:47:49.679 --> 00:47:50.887
Lorraine, you ever have a kid

637
00:47:50.972 --> 00:47:53.265
who acts that way, I'll disown you.

638
00:48:31.345 --> 00:48:32.429
Doc?

639
00:48:33.347 --> 00:48:34.889
Don't say a word.

640
00:48:36.183 --> 00:48:37.267
I don't wanna know your name.

641
00:48:37.351 --> 00:48:38.518
I don't want to know anything about you.

642
00:48:38.603 --> 00:48:40.353
Listen, Doc... Quiet!

643
00:48:40.438 --> 00:48:41.938
Doc, it's me, Marty.
Don't tell me anything.

644
00:48:42.023 --> 00:48:44.190
Doc, you got to help... Quiet. Quiet.

645
00:48:46.944 --> 00:48:48.945
I'm going to read your thoughts.

646
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:52.616
Let's see now. You've come
here from a great distance?

647
00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:53.825
Yeah. Exactly.

648
00:48:53.909 --> 00:48:55.035
Don't tell me!

649
00:48:55.703 --> 00:48:57.120
You want me to buy a subscription

650
00:48:57.204 --> 00:48:58.538
to the Saturday Evening Post.

651
00:48:58.623 --> 00:48:59.664
No.

652
00:48:59.749 --> 00:49:01.207
Not a word. Not a word now!

653
00:49:01.292 --> 00:49:02.459
Quiet.

654
00:49:04.629 --> 00:49:08.214
Donations. You want
me to make a donation

655
00:49:08.299 --> 00:49:10.550
to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.

656
00:49:11.135 --> 00:49:12.552
Doc.

657
00:49:14.055 --> 00:49:15.096
I'm from the future.

658
00:49:16.265 --> 00:49:19.392
I came here in a time
machine that you invented.

659
00:49:19.769 --> 00:49:24.564
Now, I need your help to
get back to the year 1985.

660
00:49:25.941 --> 00:49:27.525
My God.

661
00:49:31.947 --> 00:49:34.157
Do you know what this means?

662
00:49:35.826 --> 00:49:40.163
It means that this damn
thing doesn't work at all!

663
00:49:40.247 --> 00:49:42.165
Doc, you got to help
me. You are the only one

664
00:49:42.249 --> 00:49:44.584
who knows how your time machine works.

665
00:49:44.669 --> 00:49:48.505
Time machine? I haven't
invented any time machine.

666
00:49:50.424 --> 00:49:52.842
Okay. All right, I'll prove it to you.

667
00:49:52.927 --> 00:49:56.096
Look at my driver's
license. Expires 1987.

668
00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:57.681
Look at my birthday,
for crying out loud!

669
00:49:57.765 --> 00:49:59.766
I haven't even been born yet.

670
00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.185
And look at this picture.

671
00:50:02.269 --> 00:50:04.270
It's my brother, my sister and me.

672
00:50:04.355 --> 00:50:07.649
Look at her sweatshirt,
Doc. "Class of 1984"?

673
00:50:08.609 --> 00:50:10.610
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.

674
00:50:10.695 --> 00:50:12.946
They cut off your brother's hair.

675
00:50:13.489 --> 00:50:15.865
I'm telling the truth,
Doc. You got to believe me.

676
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:18.034
Then tell me, future boy,

677
00:50:19.203 --> 00:50:22.956
Who's President of the
United States in 1985?

678
00:50:23.374 --> 00:50:24.416
Ronald Reagan.

679
00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.876
Ronald Reagan? The actor?

680
00:50:28.462 --> 00:50:31.005
Then who's vice president? Jerry Lewis?

681
00:50:32.174 --> 00:50:34.551
I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady.

682
00:50:34.635 --> 00:50:35.719
Whoa. Wait, Doc!

683
00:50:35.803 --> 00:50:38.012
And Jack Benny is
secretary of the treasury.

684
00:50:38.097 --> 00:50:39.514
Doc, you gotta listen to me.

685
00:50:39.598 --> 00:50:41.683
I've had enough practical
jokes for one evening.

686
00:50:41.767 --> 00:50:42.934
Good night, future boy!

687
00:50:43.018 --> 00:50:44.394
No, wait, Doc. Doc.

688
00:50:44.478 --> 00:50:47.272
The bruise on your head,
I know how that happened.

689
00:50:47.356 --> 00:50:48.773
You told me the whole story.

690
00:50:48.858 --> 00:50:50.316
You were standing on your toilet

691
00:50:50.401 --> 00:50:51.443
and you were hanging a clock,

692
00:50:51.527 --> 00:50:53.737
and you fell and you hit
your head on the sink.

693
00:50:53.821 --> 00:50:56.740
That's when you came up with
the idea for the flux capacitor,

694
00:50:56.824 --> 00:51:00.827
which is what makes
time travel possible.

695
00:51:13.924 --> 00:51:18.094
There's something wrong with
the starter, so I hid it here.

696
00:51:28.606 --> 00:51:32.442
After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

697
00:51:36.947 --> 00:51:38.740
The flux capacitor.

698
00:51:56.592 --> 00:51:57.884
It works!

699
00:52:00.429 --> 00:52:01.971
It works!

700
00:52:03.265 --> 00:52:05.975
I finally invent something that works!

701
00:52:06.727 --> 00:52:08.853
You bet your ass it works.

702
00:52:09.772 --> 00:52:12.816
Somehow we've got to sneak
this back to my laboratory.

703
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.818
We've got to get you home!

704
00:52:15.486 --> 00:52:17.278
Okay, Doc, this is it.

705
00:52:19.073 --> 00:52:21.157
Never mind that. Never mind that now.

706
00:52:21.242 --> 00:52:24.661
Why, that's me! Look
at me! I'm an old man.

707
00:52:24.745 --> 00:52:25.995
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

708
00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.164
I'm standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.

709
00:52:28.249 --> 00:52:30.250
Thank God, I've still got my hair.

710
00:52:30.334 --> 00:52:32.335
What's on Earth is
this thing I'm wearing?

711
00:52:32.419 --> 00:52:34.587
This is a radiation suit.

712
00:52:34.672 --> 00:52:36.422
Radiation suit?

713
00:52:36.507 --> 00:52:39.509
Of course. 'Cause of all the
fallout from the atomic wars.

714
00:52:40.845 --> 00:52:43.513
This is truly amazing.

715
00:52:44.014 --> 00:52:46.850
A portable television studio.

716
00:52:46.934 --> 00:52:48.434
No wonder your president
has to be an actor.

717
00:52:48.519 --> 00:52:50.687
He's gotta look good on television.

718
00:52:50.771 --> 00:52:53.189
Whoa. This is it. This is
the part coming up, Doc.

719
00:52:53.941 --> 00:52:55.400
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,

720
00:52:55.484 --> 00:52:56.526
but I need a nuclear reaction

721
00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:58.403
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...

722
00:52:58.487 --> 00:53:00.280
What did I just say?

723
00:53:04.285 --> 00:53:05.368
This sucker's electrical,

724
00:53:05.452 --> 00:53:06.578
but I need a nuclear reaction

725
00:53:06.662 --> 00:53:08.371
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...

726
00:53:08.455 --> 00:53:10.790
1.21 gigawatts!

727
00:53:12.293 --> 00:53:14.502
1.21 gigawatts.

728
00:53:16.505 --> 00:53:18.131
Great Scott!

729
00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:22.510
What the hell is a gigawatt?

730
00:53:23.512 --> 00:53:27.599
How could I have been so
careless? 1.21 gigawatts!

731
00:53:27.683 --> 00:53:30.393
Tom, how am I going to
generate that kind of power?

732
00:53:30.477 --> 00:53:32.103
It can't be done, can it?

733
00:53:32.187 --> 00:53:34.939
Doc, look. All we need
is a little plutonium.

734
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:37.901
I'm sure that in 1985,

735
00:53:37.985 --> 00:53:40.153
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore,

736
00:53:40.237 --> 00:53:42.989
but in 1955, it's a
little hard to come by.

737
00:53:43.073 --> 00:53:46.409
Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid you're stuck here.

738
00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:47.660
Whoa, whoa.

739
00:53:47.745 --> 00:53:52.165
Doc, stuck here? I can't be
stuck here. I got a life in 1985.

740
00:53:52.249 --> 00:53:53.333
I got a girl.

741
00:53:53.417 --> 00:53:54.459
Is she pretty?

742
00:53:55.002 --> 00:53:58.963
Doc, she's beautiful.
She's crazy about me.

743
00:53:59.048 --> 00:54:03.343
Look at this. Look what she wrote
here, Doc. I mean, that says it all.

744
00:54:04.595 --> 00:54:07.180
Doc, you're my only hope.

745
00:54:07.848 --> 00:54:11.184
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only
power source capable of generating

746
00:54:11.268 --> 00:54:14.687
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

747
00:54:15.898 --> 00:54:17.023
What did you say?

748
00:54:17.107 --> 00:54:18.274
A bolt of lightning.

749
00:54:18.359 --> 00:54:19.359
Unfortunately, you never know

750
00:54:19.443 --> 00:54:22.570
when or where it's ever going to strike.

751
00:54:24.073 --> 00:54:25.448
We do now.

752
00:54:30.537 --> 00:54:34.123
This is it! This is the answer.

753
00:54:34.875 --> 00:54:37.293
It says here that a bolt of lightning

754
00:54:37.378 --> 00:54:38.378
is going to strike the clock tower

755
00:54:38.462 --> 00:54:41.714
at precisely 10:04 p.m.
Next Saturday night!

756
00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.721
If we could somehow
harness this lightning,

757
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:53.142
channel it into the flux capacitor,

758
00:54:54.436 --> 00:54:56.229
it just might work.

759
00:54:56.522 --> 00:55:00.775
Next Saturday night, we're
sending you back to the future!

760
00:55:01.735 --> 00:55:03.611
Okay, all right. Saturday's
good. Saturday's good.

761
00:55:03.696 --> 00:55:05.488
I can spend a week in 1955.

762
00:55:05.572 --> 00:55:07.323
I can hang out. You can show me around.

763
00:55:07.408 --> 00:55:09.242
Marty, that is completely
out of the question.

764
00:55:09.326 --> 00:55:10.660
You must not leave this house.

765
00:55:10.744 --> 00:55:12.745
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

766
00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:15.415
Anything you do can have serious
repercussions on future events.

767
00:55:15.499 --> 00:55:17.250
Do you understand?

768
00:55:18.127 --> 00:55:20.086
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

769
00:55:20.713 --> 00:55:21.921
Marty,

770
00:55:22.339 --> 00:55:25.800
have you interacted with
anybody else today, besides me?

771
00:55:27.594 --> 00:55:30.722
Yeah, well, I might've sort
of bumped into my parents.

772
00:55:30.806 --> 00:55:32.348
Great Scott!

773
00:55:32.433 --> 00:55:34.726
Let me see that photograph
again of your brother.

774
00:55:38.105 --> 00:55:41.524
Just as I thought. This proves
my theory. Look at your brother.

775
00:55:42.776 --> 00:55:45.987
His head's gone.
It's like it's been erased.

776
00:55:47.656 --> 00:55:49.699
Erased from existence.

777
00:55:54.288 --> 00:55:55.371
Whoa.

778
00:55:55.456 --> 00:55:58.207
They really cleaned this
place up. Looks brand-new.

779
00:55:58.292 --> 00:55:59.292
Now remember.

780
00:55:59.376 --> 00:56:00.626
According to my theory, you interfered

781
00:56:00.711 --> 00:56:01.878
with your parents' first meeting.

782
00:56:01.962 --> 00:56:03.212
If they don't meet,
they won't fall in love,

783
00:56:03.297 --> 00:56:05.089
they won't get married
and they won't have kids.

784
00:56:05.174 --> 00:56:06.215
That's why your older brother's

785
00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:07.550
disappearing from that photograph.

786
00:56:07.634 --> 00:56:09.844
Your sister will follow, and
unless you repair the damage,

787
00:56:09.928 --> 00:56:11.137
you'll be next.

788
00:56:11.221 --> 00:56:13.056
Sounds pretty heavy.
Weight has nothing to do with it.

789
00:56:14.266 --> 00:56:16.142
Which one's your pop?

790
00:56:17.311 --> 00:56:18.644
That's him.

791
00:56:19.104 --> 00:56:21.522
Okay. Okay, you guys.

792
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:26.402
Very funny. You guys
are being real mature.

793
00:56:26.487 --> 00:56:28.362
Maybe you were adopted.

794
00:56:28.447 --> 00:56:30.990
Okay, real mature, guys.

795
00:56:31.909 --> 00:56:33.284
Okay, pick up my books.

796
00:56:33.368 --> 00:56:34.410
McFly.

797
00:56:34.495 --> 00:56:36.204
That's Strickland.

798
00:56:36.663 --> 00:56:38.748
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

799
00:56:38.832 --> 00:56:41.584
Shape up, man. You're a slacker.

800
00:56:41.668 --> 00:56:44.754
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

801
00:56:44.838 --> 00:56:45.880
No.

802
00:56:46.256 --> 00:56:47.799
What did your mother
ever see in that kid?

803
00:56:47.883 --> 00:56:49.175
I don't know, Doc.

804
00:56:49.259 --> 00:56:50.968
I guess she felt sorry for him

805
00:56:51.053 --> 00:56:53.387
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

806
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.932
Hit me with the car.

807
00:56:56.016 --> 00:56:58.017
That's the Florence Nightingale effect.

808
00:56:58.102 --> 00:57:01.437
It happens in hospitals when nurses
fall in love with their patients.

809
00:57:01.522 --> 00:57:02.772
Go to it, kid.

810
00:57:03.607 --> 00:57:06.442
Hey, George, buddy.

811
00:57:07.027 --> 00:57:09.403
I have been looking all over for you.

812
00:57:09.488 --> 00:57:12.448
You remember me, the guy who
saved your life the other day?

813
00:57:12.533 --> 00:57:13.616
Oh.

814
00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:14.700
Yeah. Good.

815
00:57:14.785 --> 00:57:16.786
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

816
00:57:21.208 --> 00:57:22.792
Lorraine?

817
00:57:22.876 --> 00:57:24.001
Calvin!

818
00:57:25.462 --> 00:57:28.214
I'd like you to meet my
good friend George McFly.

819
00:57:28.298 --> 00:57:31.551
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.

820
00:57:32.719 --> 00:57:33.761
How's your head?

821
00:57:33.846 --> 00:57:35.179
Good. Fine.

822
00:57:35.264 --> 00:57:37.140
Oh. I've been so worried about you

823
00:57:37.224 --> 00:57:39.100
ever since you ran off the other night.

824
00:57:39.184 --> 00:57:40.643
Are you okay? Yeah.

825
00:57:41.895 --> 00:57:43.146
I'm sorry. I have to go.

826
00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:44.480
Come on!

827
00:57:45.315 --> 00:57:47.150
Isn't he a dreamboat?

828
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.864
Doc, she didn't even look at him.

829
00:57:52.948 --> 00:57:54.490
This is more serious than I thought.

830
00:57:54.575 --> 00:57:56.534
Apparently, your mother is
amorously infatuated with you,

831
00:57:56.618 --> 00:57:58.244
instead of your father.

832
00:57:58.871 --> 00:57:59.996
Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.

833
00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.749
Are you trying to tell me that
my mother has got the hots for me?

834
00:58:03.834 --> 00:58:04.959
Precisely.

835
00:58:05.043 --> 00:58:06.085
Whoa. This is heavy.

836
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:08.754
There's that word again. "Heavy."

837
00:58:08.839 --> 00:58:10.173
Why are things so heavy in the future?

838
00:58:10.257 --> 00:58:12.341
Is there a problem with the
Earth's gravitational pull?

839
00:58:12.426 --> 00:58:13.509
What? The only way

840
00:58:13.594 --> 00:58:15.011
we're going to get those
two to successfully mate

841
00:58:15.095 --> 00:58:16.470
is if they're alone together,

842
00:58:16.555 --> 00:58:19.182
so you've got to get your
father and mother to interact

843
00:58:19.266 --> 00:58:21.350
in some sort of social...

844
00:58:22.686 --> 00:58:24.228
What? You mean like a date? Right!

845
00:58:25.439 --> 00:58:26.522
What kind of date? I don't know.

846
00:58:26.607 --> 00:58:28.149
What do kids do in the '50s?

847
00:58:28.233 --> 00:58:31.027
They're your parents.
You must know them.

848
00:58:31.111 --> 00:58:32.236
What are their common interests?

849
00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:34.280
What do they like to do together?

850
00:58:35.282 --> 00:58:36.365
Nothing.

851
00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:39.660
Look! There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.

852
00:58:39.745 --> 00:58:41.704
Of course! The Enchantment
Under the Sea dance!

853
00:58:41.788 --> 00:58:43.164
They're supposed to go to this.

854
00:58:43.248 --> 00:58:44.999
That's where they kiss
for the first time.

855
00:58:45.083 --> 00:58:46.459
All right, kid.

856
00:58:46.543 --> 00:58:48.127
You stick to your father like glue

857
00:58:48.212 --> 00:58:49.754
and make sure he takes
her to that dance.

858
00:58:50.464 --> 00:58:51.964
George, buddy.

859
00:58:52.799 --> 00:58:56.052
Remember that girl I
introduced you to, Lorraine?

860
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:03.726
What are you writing?

861
00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:05.811
Uh... Stories.

862
00:59:06.647 --> 00:59:10.191
Science fiction stories about visitors

863
00:59:10.651 --> 00:59:13.903
coming down to Earth from other planets.

864
00:59:15.948 --> 00:59:19.617
Get out of town! I didn't
know you did anything creative.

865
00:59:20.118 --> 00:59:21.244
Let me read some.

866
00:59:21.328 --> 00:59:22.912
Oh. No, no, no, no.

867
00:59:22.996 --> 00:59:25.831
I never let anybody read my stories.

868
00:59:26.583 --> 00:59:27.833
Why not?

869
00:59:28.252 --> 00:59:30.127
Well, what if they didn't like them?

870
00:59:30.212 --> 00:59:32.672
What if they told me I was no good?

871
00:59:34.758 --> 00:59:37.593
I guess that would be pretty
hard for somebody to understand.

872
00:59:39.012 --> 00:59:41.597
No. No, not hard at all.

873
00:59:42.808 --> 00:59:45.351
So, anyway, George. About Lorraine.

874
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.354
She really likes you.

875
00:59:49.314 --> 00:59:52.275
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her

876
00:59:52.359 --> 00:59:54.110
to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

877
00:59:54.194 --> 00:59:55.361
Really? Oh, yeah.

878
00:59:55.445 --> 00:59:58.531
All you got to do is go
over there and ask her.

879
00:59:59.449 --> 01:00:01.617
What? Right here, right
now, in the cafeteria?

880
01:00:01.702 --> 01:00:02.785
What if she said no?

881
01:00:02.869 --> 01:00:06.330
I don't know if I could take
that kind of a rejection.

882
01:00:07.124 --> 01:00:11.043
Besides, I think she'd
rather go with somebody else.

883
01:00:12.379 --> 01:00:13.546
Who?

884
01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.465
Biff.

885
01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:19.135
Don't kid around. Come on.

886
01:00:19.219 --> 01:00:20.469
I'm gonna leave.

887
01:00:20.554 --> 01:00:22.430
You want it. You know you want it.

888
01:00:22.514 --> 01:00:24.640
You know you want me to give it to you.

889
01:00:24.725 --> 01:00:27.310
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

890
01:00:28.562 --> 01:00:31.314
Maybe you are and you
just don't know it yet.

891
01:00:31.398 --> 01:00:33.232
Get your meat hooks off of me.

892
01:00:33.317 --> 01:00:34.358
You heard her.

893
01:00:34.443 --> 01:00:37.820
She said, get your meat hooks off.

894
01:00:39.239 --> 01:00:40.489
Please.

895
01:00:41.325 --> 01:00:43.409
So what's it to you, butthead?

896
01:00:44.536 --> 01:00:46.787
You know, you been looking for a fight.

897
01:00:56.715 --> 01:01:00.760
Since you're new here, I'm
going to cut you a break, today.

898
01:01:02.596 --> 01:01:06.349
So, why don't you make like
a tree and get out of here.

899
01:01:19.071 --> 01:01:20.279
George!

900
01:01:21.615 --> 01:01:23.657
Why do you keep following me around?

901
01:01:23.742 --> 01:01:26.702
Look, George... I'm telling you, George,

902
01:01:26.787 --> 01:01:28.537
if you do not ask
Lorraine to that dance,

903
01:01:28.622 --> 01:01:30.122
I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

904
01:01:30.207 --> 01:01:31.665
But I can't go to the dance.

905
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:34.877
I'll miss my favorite television
program, Science Fiction Theatre.

906
01:01:34.961 --> 01:01:38.339
Yeah, but, George, Lorraine
wants to go with you.

907
01:01:38.423 --> 01:01:39.548
Give her a break.

908
01:01:39.633 --> 01:01:43.803
Look, I'm just not ready to
ask Lorraine out to the dance,

909
01:01:44.596 --> 01:01:47.807
and not you or anybody
else on this planet

910
01:01:47.891 --> 01:01:50.476
is going to make me change my mind.

911
01:01:57.275 --> 01:01:59.276
Science Fiction Theatre.

912
01:02:30.851 --> 01:02:31.892
Who are you?

913
01:02:37.482 --> 01:02:39.525
Silence, Earthling.

914
01:02:40.986 --> 01:02:43.446
My name is Darth Vader.

915
01:02:48.493 --> 01:02:51.954
I am an extraterrestrial
from the planet Vulcan.

916
01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.207
Marty!

917
01:02:58.378 --> 01:02:59.462
Marty! Marty!

918
01:02:59.546 --> 01:03:00.629
Hey, George, buddy.

919
01:03:00.714 --> 01:03:03.090
You weren't at school. What
have you been doing all day?

920
01:03:03.175 --> 01:03:06.093
I overslept. Look, I need your help.

921
01:03:06.178 --> 01:03:07.636
I have to ask Lorraine out,

922
01:03:07.721 --> 01:03:08.804
but I don't know how to do it.

923
01:03:08.889 --> 01:03:11.724
All right. Okay, listen, keep your
pants on. She's over in the cafe.

924
01:03:11.808 --> 01:03:13.851
God! How do you...

925
01:03:16.938 --> 01:03:18.397
What made you change your mind, George?

926
01:03:18.482 --> 01:03:21.400
Last night, Darth Vader
came down from Planet Vulcan

927
01:03:21.485 --> 01:03:25.404
and told me that if I didn't take
Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.

928
01:03:25.489 --> 01:03:28.574
Let's just keep this brain-melting
stuff to ourselves, okay?

929
01:03:28.658 --> 01:03:29.783
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

930
01:03:29.868 --> 01:03:32.161
All right, okay. There she is, George.

931
01:03:32.245 --> 01:03:33.996
Now just go in there and invite her.

932
01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.664
Okay. But I don't know what to say.

933
01:03:35.749 --> 01:03:36.832
Just say anything, George.

934
01:03:36.917 --> 01:03:40.961
Say whatever's natural, the first
thing that comes into your mind.

935
01:03:41.588 --> 01:03:43.506
Nothing's coming to my mind.

936
01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:45.299
Jesus, George, it's a
wonder I was even born.

937
01:03:45.383 --> 01:03:46.342
What? What?

938
01:03:46.426 --> 01:03:47.927
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

939
01:03:48.512 --> 01:03:52.598
Look, tell her destiny
brought you together.

940
01:03:52.682 --> 01:03:54.600
Tell her that she is
the most beautiful girl

941
01:03:54.684 --> 01:03:56.519
you have ever seen in the world.

942
01:03:56.603 --> 01:03:58.562
Girls like that stuff.

943
01:03:58.939 --> 01:03:59.939
What are you doing, George?

944
01:04:00.023 --> 01:04:01.815
I'm writing this down.
This is good stuff.

945
01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.400
Yeah. Okay, let's go.

946
01:04:03.485 --> 01:04:04.944
Can you take care of that? Right.

947
01:04:23.463 --> 01:04:26.382
Lou, give me a milk.

948
01:04:27.759 --> 01:04:29.134
Chocolate.

949
01:04:45.318 --> 01:04:50.406
Lorraine. My density
has popped me to you.

950
01:04:51.783 --> 01:04:52.992
What?

951
01:04:53.159 --> 01:04:54.243
Oh.

952
01:04:55.078 --> 01:04:57.746
What I meant to say was...

953
01:04:57.831 --> 01:05:00.916
Wait a minute. Don't I
know you from somewhere?

954
01:05:01.334 --> 01:05:02.459
Yes.

955
01:05:02.752 --> 01:05:06.672
Yes. I'm George. George McFly.

956
01:05:07.299 --> 01:05:08.966
I'm your density.

957
01:05:09.968 --> 01:05:11.260
I mean,

958
01:05:12.679 --> 01:05:14.096
your destiny.

959
01:05:15.307 --> 01:05:16.390
Oh.

960
01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.517
Hey, McFly.

961
01:05:22.939 --> 01:05:25.858
I thought I told you
never to come in here.

962
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:30.571
Well, it's going to cost you.

963
01:05:30.947 --> 01:05:33.198
How much money you got on you?

964
01:05:33.533 --> 01:05:35.659
How much do you want, Biff?

965
01:05:43.877 --> 01:05:45.461
All right, punk.

966
01:05:45.545 --> 01:05:46.545
Now I'm going to...

967
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:48.297
Whoa, whoa, Biff. What's that?

968
01:05:55.013 --> 01:05:58.057
That's Calvin Klein.
Oh, my God, he's a dream.

969
01:05:58.224 --> 01:05:59.266
Whoa, whoa.

970
01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:01.143
Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!

971
01:06:01.227 --> 01:06:02.394
Hey!

972
01:06:04.564 --> 01:06:05.648
I'll get it
back to you, all right?

973
01:06:06.691 --> 01:06:08.400
You broke it!

974
01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:09.818
Come back here!

975
01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:13.781
Wow. Look at him go!

976
01:06:15.659 --> 01:06:16.909
Get him!

977
01:06:30.256 --> 01:06:32.424
To the car! Go! Go!

978
01:06:38.723 --> 01:06:39.973
What's that thing he's on?

979
01:06:40.058 --> 01:06:41.517
It's a board with wheels.

980
01:06:41.601 --> 01:06:43.185
He's an absolute dream.

981
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:44.478
Come on, come on!

982
01:06:44.562 --> 01:06:46.105
Look out for the car!

983
01:07:01.871 --> 01:07:03.122
Whoa!

984
01:07:19.431 --> 01:07:21.265
I'm going to ram him.

985
01:07:28.648 --> 01:07:29.815
Shit!

986
01:07:41.369 --> 01:07:42.494
Ooh!

987
01:07:55.049 --> 01:07:56.759
Thanks a lot, kid.

988
01:07:57.886 --> 01:08:00.304
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.

989
01:08:00.388 --> 01:08:01.430
Where does he come from?

990
01:08:01.514 --> 01:08:03.390
Yeah, where does he live?

991
01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:07.686
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

992
01:08:13.526 --> 01:08:14.860
Oh, my God.

993
01:08:15.278 --> 01:08:18.363
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

994
01:08:18.448 --> 01:08:20.115
Run for it, Marty!

995
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:26.205
Oh, my God.

996
01:08:26.998 --> 01:08:29.917
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

997
01:08:30.001 --> 01:08:31.376
Run for it, Marty!

998
01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:33.754
Doc?

999
01:08:34.506 --> 01:08:37.466
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.

1000
01:08:38.426 --> 01:08:40.969
Fascinating device, this video unit.

1001
01:08:41.971 --> 01:08:43.639
Listen, Doc.

1002
01:08:43.723 --> 01:08:44.681
You know, there's something

1003
01:08:44.766 --> 01:08:45.933
I haven't told you about the night

1004
01:08:46.059 --> 01:08:47.351
we made that tape. Please,
Marty, don't tell me.

1005
01:08:47.435 --> 01:08:48.727
No man should know too
much about his own destiny.

1006
01:08:48.812 --> 01:08:50.187
You don't understand. I do understand.

1007
01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:51.480
If I know too much about my own future,

1008
01:08:51.564 --> 01:08:52.981
I can endanger my own existence.

1009
01:08:53.066 --> 01:08:55.400
Just as you've endangered yours.

1010
01:08:57.362 --> 01:08:59.279
You're right. Now...

1011
01:08:59.364 --> 01:09:02.241
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

1012
01:09:02.325 --> 01:09:04.076
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

1013
01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.495
I didn't have time to build
it to scale or paint it.

1014
01:09:06.579 --> 01:09:08.497
It's good. Thank you. Thank you.

1015
01:09:09.791 --> 01:09:10.999
Okay, now.

1016
01:09:11.084 --> 01:09:13.293
We run some industrial-strength
electrical cable

1017
01:09:13.378 --> 01:09:15.212
from the top of the clock tower

1018
01:09:15.296 --> 01:09:16.922
down, suspending it over the street

1019
01:09:17.006 --> 01:09:18.590
between these two lamp posts.

1020
01:09:19.217 --> 01:09:21.677
Meanwhile, we've
outfitted the time vehicle

1021
01:09:21.761 --> 01:09:23.220
with this big pole and hook,

1022
01:09:23.304 --> 01:09:26.265
which runs directly
into the flux capacitor.

1023
01:09:27.183 --> 01:09:31.854
At the calculated moment, you
start off from down the street,

1024
01:09:31.938 --> 01:09:33.188
driving directly toward the cable,

1025
01:09:33.273 --> 01:09:36.191
accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

1026
01:09:36.526 --> 01:09:39.903
According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 p.m. This Saturday night,

1027
01:09:39.988 --> 01:09:43.615
lightning will strike the clock
tower, electrifying the cable

1028
01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.951
just as the connecting
hook makes contact

1029
01:09:46.035 --> 01:09:49.663
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor

1030
01:09:50.039 --> 01:09:52.207
and sending you back to 1985.

1031
01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:54.334
All right, now. Watch this.

1032
01:09:54.419 --> 01:09:56.336
You wind up the car and release it.

1033
01:09:58.131 --> 01:10:00.340
I'll simulate the lightning.

1034
01:10:08.641 --> 01:10:09.808
Ready.

1035
01:10:19.569 --> 01:10:20.694
Set.

1036
01:10:25.742 --> 01:10:26.992
Release.

1037
01:10:45.386 --> 01:10:47.554
You're instilling me with
a lot of confidence, Doc.

1038
01:10:47.639 --> 01:10:49.014
Don't worry. I'll take
care of the lightning.

1039
01:10:49.098 --> 01:10:51.683
You take care of your pop.

1040
01:10:52.852 --> 01:10:55.854
By the way, what happened
today? Did he ask her out?

1041
01:10:55.939 --> 01:10:57.064
I think so.

1042
01:10:57.148 --> 01:10:58.190
What did she say?

1043
01:11:06.866 --> 01:11:08.617
It's your mom! She's tracked you down!

1044
01:11:08.701 --> 01:11:10.953
Quick! Let's cover the time machine.

1045
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.760
Hi, Cal... Marty.

1046
01:11:27.261 --> 01:11:28.679
Mom. Lorraine.

1047
01:11:30.223 --> 01:11:32.432
How did you know I was here?

1048
01:11:33.351 --> 01:11:34.893
I followed you.

1049
01:11:35.728 --> 01:11:37.729
Oh. This is my doc...

1050
01:11:37.814 --> 01:11:40.899
My uncle, Doc Brown.

1051
01:11:42.235 --> 01:11:43.485
Hi. Hi.

1052
01:11:46.572 --> 01:11:49.741
Marty, this may seem a little forward,

1053
01:11:50.118 --> 01:11:54.329
but I was kind of
wondering if you'd ask me

1054
01:11:54.414 --> 01:11:58.250
to the Enchantment Under
the Sea dance on Saturday.

1055
01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.131
Wow, you mean... You
mean nobody's asked you?

1056
01:12:04.799 --> 01:12:07.884
No. Not yet.

1057
01:12:09.595 --> 01:12:11.138
What about George?

1058
01:12:11.222 --> 01:12:13.015
George McFly?

1059
01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:19.563
He's kind of cute and all, but not...

1060
01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.568
Well, I think a man should be strong,

1061
01:12:26.487 --> 01:12:28.739
so he can stand up for himself

1062
01:12:29.782 --> 01:12:32.034
and protect the woman he loves.

1063
01:12:36.748 --> 01:12:38.123
Don't you?

1064
01:12:39.625 --> 01:12:40.709
Yeah.

1065
01:12:41.169 --> 01:12:43.170
I still don't understand.

1066
01:12:43.629 --> 01:12:46.339
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her

1067
01:12:46.424 --> 01:12:49.176
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

1068
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:51.928
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

1069
01:12:52.013 --> 01:12:53.930
She just doesn't know it yet.

1070
01:12:54.015 --> 01:12:55.015
That's why we got to show her

1071
01:12:55.099 --> 01:12:57.059
that you, George McFly, are a fighter.

1072
01:12:57.143 --> 01:12:59.061
You're somebody who's
gonna stand up for yourself,

1073
01:12:59.145 --> 01:13:00.604
somebody who's gonna protect her.

1074
01:13:00.688 --> 01:13:03.899
Yeah, but I've never picked
a fight in my entire life.

1075
01:13:03.983 --> 01:13:06.735
Look, you're not going to
be picking a fight, Dad.

1076
01:13:06.819 --> 01:13:09.029
Daddy-o.

1077
01:13:09.113 --> 01:13:11.406
You're coming to her rescue, right?

1078
01:13:11.491 --> 01:13:12.657
Okay, let's go over the plan again.

1079
01:13:12.742 --> 01:13:14.493
8:55, where are you going to be?

1080
01:13:14.577 --> 01:13:16.161
I'm going to be at the dance.

1081
01:13:16.245 --> 01:13:17.287
Right. And where am I going to be?

1082
01:13:17.371 --> 01:13:19.372
You're gonna be in the car with her.

1083
01:13:19.457 --> 01:13:20.916
Right, okay. So, right around 9:00,

1084
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.417
she's going to get very angry with me.

1085
01:13:22.502 --> 01:13:24.920
Why is she going to get angry with you?

1086
01:13:25.004 --> 01:13:27.339
Well, because, George,
nice girls get angry

1087
01:13:27.423 --> 01:13:29.674
when guys take advantage of them.

1088
01:13:31.928 --> 01:13:33.929
You mean you're going
to go touch her on her...

1089
01:13:34.013 --> 01:13:36.473
No. No, George, look.

1090
01:13:37.308 --> 01:13:39.267
It's just an act, right?

1091
01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:43.063
Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

1092
01:13:43.481 --> 01:13:46.691
You see us struggling in the car.

1093
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:50.278
You walk up, you open
the door, and you say...

1094
01:13:51.906 --> 01:13:53.657
Your line, George.

1095
01:13:54.951 --> 01:13:56.118
Oh!

1096
01:13:56.786 --> 01:13:59.621
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!

1097
01:14:01.958 --> 01:14:03.291
You really think I ought to swear?

1098
01:14:03.376 --> 01:14:04.376
Yes, definitely.

1099
01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:06.086
God damn it, George, swear.

1100
01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:08.171
Okay. So, now you come up.

1101
01:14:08.256 --> 01:14:09.381
You punch me in the stomach.

1102
01:14:09.465 --> 01:14:11.258
I'm out for the count, right?

1103
01:14:11.342 --> 01:14:14.553
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

1104
01:14:14.637 --> 01:14:16.847
You make it sound so easy.

1105
01:14:16.931 --> 01:14:19.391
I just... I wish I wasn't so scared.

1106
01:14:19.475 --> 01:14:20.725
George, there's nothing to be scared of.

1107
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:23.353
All it takes is a
little self-confidence.

1108
01:14:23.437 --> 01:14:26.148
You know, if you put your mind to it,

1109
01:14:26.232 --> 01:14:27.691
you can accomplish anything.

1110
01:14:30.319 --> 01:14:32.529
...Hill Valley area
weather this Saturday night.

1111
01:14:32.613 --> 01:14:35.615
Mostly clear, with
some scattered clouds.

1112
01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.409
Lows tonight in the upper 40s.

1113
01:14:37.493 --> 01:14:39.411
Are you sure about this storm?

1114
01:14:40.246 --> 01:14:44.416
Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future?

1115
01:14:44.917 --> 01:14:47.586
You know, Marty, I'm going
to be very sad to see you go.

1116
01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:48.879
You've really made a
difference in my life.

1117
01:14:48.963 --> 01:14:51.089
You've given me something to shoot for.

1118
01:14:51.174 --> 01:14:55.343
Just knowing that I'm going
to be around to see 1985.

1119
01:14:55.428 --> 01:14:57.345
That I'm going to succeed in this!

1120
01:14:57.430 --> 01:15:00.974
That I'm going to have a
chance to travel through time!

1121
01:15:06.439 --> 01:15:09.107
It's going to be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you

1122
01:15:09.192 --> 01:15:12.152
about everything that's
happened in the past few days.

1123
01:15:12.236 --> 01:15:14.821
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

1124
01:15:16.157 --> 01:15:17.991
I'm really going to miss you.

1125
01:15:22.371 --> 01:15:23.538
Doc, about the future...

1126
01:15:23.623 --> 01:15:24.706
No!

1127
01:15:25.374 --> 01:15:27.709
Marty! We've already agreed

1128
01:15:27.793 --> 01:15:29.085
that having information about the future

1129
01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:30.629
can be extremely dangerous.

1130
01:15:30.713 --> 01:15:32.214
Even if your intentions are good,

1131
01:15:32.298 --> 01:15:34.257
it can backfire drastically.

1132
01:15:35.509 --> 01:15:36.718
Whatever you've got to tell me,

1133
01:15:36.802 --> 01:15:39.888
I'll find out through the
natural course of time.

1134
01:15:40.932 --> 01:15:42.891
"Dear Dr. Brown.

1135
01:15:43.643 --> 01:15:46.102
"On the night that I go back in time,

1136
01:15:46.562 --> 01:15:48.313
"you will be

1137
01:15:48.898 --> 01:15:51.191
"shot by terrorists.

1138
01:15:52.318 --> 01:15:54.778
"Please take whatever
precautions are necessary

1139
01:15:54.862 --> 01:15:57.322
"to prevent this terrible disaster.

1140
01:15:58.741 --> 01:16:00.450
"Your friend,

1141
01:16:01.494 --> 01:16:02.744
"Marty."

1142
01:16:12.171 --> 01:16:15.131
'Evening, Dr. Brown.
What's with the wire?

1143
01:16:15.216 --> 01:16:18.134
Oh, just a little weather experiment.

1144
01:16:19.971 --> 01:16:20.971
What you got under here?

1145
01:16:21.055 --> 01:16:22.055
No! Don't touch that!

1146
01:16:22.139 --> 01:16:24.933
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

1147
01:16:25.017 --> 01:16:27.227
You got a permit for that?

1148
01:16:27.311 --> 01:16:28.603
Of course I do.

1149
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:39.197
Just a second. Let me
see if I can find it here.

1150
01:17:31.334 --> 01:17:35.920
Do you mind if we park for a while?

1151
01:17:37.131 --> 01:17:39.132
That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

1152
01:17:39.216 --> 01:17:40.216
Huh?

1153
01:17:40.301 --> 01:17:43.011
Marty, I'm almost 18 years old.

1154
01:17:43.095 --> 01:17:45.013
It's not like I've never parked before.

1155
01:17:45.806 --> 01:17:47.098
What?

1156
01:17:47.641 --> 01:17:50.643
Marty, you seem so
nervous. Is something wrong?

1157
01:17:50.728 --> 01:17:54.022
No.

1158
01:17:58.778 --> 01:18:01.196
Lorraine! Lorraine, what are you doing?

1159
01:18:01.655 --> 01:18:03.990
I swiped it from the old
lady's liquor cabinet.

1160
01:18:04.075 --> 01:18:06.993
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.

1161
01:18:07.078 --> 01:18:08.036
Why not?

1162
01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:09.162
Because you...

1163
01:18:09.914 --> 01:18:12.665
You might regret it later in life.

1164
01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:15.627
Marty, don't be such a square.

1165
01:18:15.711 --> 01:18:17.629
Everybody who's anybody drinks.

1166
01:18:22.802 --> 01:18:24.636
Jeez, you smoke, too?

1167
01:18:26.013 --> 01:18:29.015
Marty, you're beginning to
sound just like my mother.

1168
01:18:40.236 --> 01:18:41.569
We're going to take a little break,

1169
01:18:41.654 --> 01:18:43.154
but we'll be back in a while,

1170
01:18:43.239 --> 01:18:45.824
so don't nobody go nowhere.

1171
01:19:02.216 --> 01:19:05.510
Marty? Why are you so nervous?

1172
01:19:06.762 --> 01:19:08.138
Lorraine.

1173
01:19:09.056 --> 01:19:13.226
Have you ever been in a situation

1174
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:15.103
where you knew you had
to act a certain way,

1175
01:19:15.187 --> 01:19:17.355
but when you got there, you didn't know

1176
01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.190
if you could go through with it?

1177
01:19:19.275 --> 01:19:22.735
You mean like how you're
supposed to act on a first date?

1178
01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.070
Sort of.

1179
01:19:24.864 --> 01:19:27.532
I think I know exactly what you mean.

1180
01:19:28.367 --> 01:19:29.659
You do?

1181
01:19:30.161 --> 01:19:32.787
You know what I do in those situations?

1182
01:19:32.872 --> 01:19:33.997
What?

1183
01:19:34.081 --> 01:19:35.123
I don't worry.

1184
01:19:53.142 --> 01:19:56.769
This is all wrong. I
don't know what it is.

1185
01:19:58.439 --> 01:20:01.900
But when I kiss you,
it's like I'm kissing

1186
01:20:03.694 --> 01:20:05.069
my brother.

1187
01:20:05.362 --> 01:20:08.072
I guess that doesn't
make any sense, does it?

1188
01:20:08.157 --> 01:20:12.160
Believe me, it makes perfect sense.

1189
01:20:13.996 --> 01:20:15.705
Somebody's coming.

1190
01:20:19.627 --> 01:20:23.838
You caused 300 bucks damage
to my car, you son of a bitch.

1191
01:20:23.923 --> 01:20:27.217
And I'm going to take it
out of your ass. Hold him.

1192
01:20:28.135 --> 01:20:30.553
Let him go, Biff. You're drunk.

1193
01:20:31.388 --> 01:20:33.848
Well, look-ey what we have here.

1194
01:20:36.644 --> 01:20:40.271
No, no! You're staying right
here with me. Come on, Lorraine.

1195
01:20:40.356 --> 01:20:41.397
Let me go!

1196
01:20:41.482 --> 01:20:42.732
Leave her alone, you bastard!

1197
01:20:42.816 --> 01:20:44.651
Take him in back, all
right? I'll be right there.

1198
01:20:44.735 --> 01:20:47.820
Just admit that
you want it. Come on.

1199
01:20:47.905 --> 01:20:50.198
Well, go on. This ain't no peep show.

1200
01:20:56.956 --> 01:20:58.081
Hey, let's put him in there.

1201
01:20:58.165 --> 01:20:59.541
Yeah!

1202
01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.294
That's for messing up my hair.

1203
01:21:03.379 --> 01:21:05.463
What the hell are you doing to my car?

1204
01:21:05.548 --> 01:21:08.007
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

1205
01:21:10.594 --> 01:21:13.179
Who you calling "spook," peckerwood?

1206
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.307
Hey, hey, listen, guys...

1207
01:21:16.392 --> 01:21:18.977
Look, I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, okay?

1208
01:21:19.061 --> 01:21:20.895
Get home to your mama, boy.

1209
01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:22.063
Biff!

1210
01:21:22.147 --> 01:21:23.231
Hurry, Biff!

1211
01:21:23.774 --> 01:21:25.608
Let me out of here!

1212
01:21:27.403 --> 01:21:28.903
Reginald, where are your keys?

1213
01:21:28.988 --> 01:21:31.155
The keys are in the trunk.

1214
01:21:31.615 --> 01:21:32.740
Say that again?

1215
01:21:32.825 --> 01:21:34.659
I said, the keys are in here.

1216
01:21:48.382 --> 01:21:49.674
Come on!

1217
01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:54.512
Hey, you, get your damn hands off...

1218
01:21:56.265 --> 01:21:57.640
Oh.

1219
01:21:57.725 --> 01:22:00.351
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

1220
01:22:01.645 --> 01:22:03.688
George, help me! Please!

1221
01:22:03.772 --> 01:22:06.649
Just turn around, McFly, and walk away.

1222
01:22:07.693 --> 01:22:08.693
Please, George.

1223
01:22:08.777 --> 01:22:09.861
Are you deaf, McFly?

1224
01:22:09.945 --> 01:22:12.030
Close the door and beat it.

1225
01:22:14.617 --> 01:22:18.202
No, Biff. You leave her alone.

1226
01:22:18.954 --> 01:22:20.747
All right, McFly.

1227
01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:27.629
You're asking for it, and
now you're going to get it.

1228
01:22:29.048 --> 01:22:30.506
Biff, stop it!

1229
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:33.801
Biff, you'll break his arm!

1230
01:22:35.304 --> 01:22:36.554
Biff, no!

1231
01:22:37.389 --> 01:22:39.682
Give me a hand here, Reginald.

1232
01:22:41.018 --> 01:22:43.311
Damn it, man! I sliced my hand!

1233
01:22:43.395 --> 01:22:44.854
Whose are these? Mine.

1234
01:22:44.938 --> 01:22:46.856
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1235
01:22:48.192 --> 01:22:50.068
You're going to break his arm!

1236
01:22:50.736 --> 01:22:53.863
Biff! Biff, leave him alone!

1237
01:22:53.947 --> 01:22:56.407
Let him go! Let him go!

1238
01:23:29.566 --> 01:23:31.150
Are you okay?

1239
01:23:51.213 --> 01:23:53.548
Who is that guy?

1240
01:23:53.632 --> 01:23:54.841
That's George McFly.

1241
01:23:58.679 --> 01:24:00.722
That's George McFly?

1242
01:24:00.806 --> 01:24:02.098
Excuse me.

1243
01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.861
The storm.

1244
01:24:16.822 --> 01:24:19.532
Hey, guys, you gotta get back
in there and finish the dance.

1245
01:24:19.616 --> 01:24:21.033
Hey, man. Look at Marvin's hand.

1246
01:24:21.118 --> 01:24:22.243
He can't play with his hand like that,

1247
01:24:22.327 --> 01:24:23.453
and we can't play without him.

1248
01:24:23.537 --> 01:24:25.997
Yeah, well. Look,
Marvin, you got to play.

1249
01:24:26.081 --> 01:24:28.249
See, that's where they kiss for
the first time on the dance floor.

1250
01:24:28.333 --> 01:24:30.042
And if there's no
music, they can't dance.

1251
01:24:30.127 --> 01:24:31.419
If they can't dance, they can't kiss.

1252
01:24:31.503 --> 01:24:33.880
If they can't kiss, they can't
fall in love and I'm history.

1253
01:24:33.964 --> 01:24:35.131
Hey, man, the dance is over

1254
01:24:35.215 --> 01:24:37.759
unless you know somebody
else that can play the guitar.

1255
01:24:45.142 --> 01:24:47.560
This is for all you lovers out there.

1256
01:24:50.147 --> 01:24:54.192
Earth angel, Earth angel

1257
01:24:54.943 --> 01:24:57.570
Will you be mine?

1258
01:24:58.155 --> 01:25:00.823
My darling dear

1259
01:25:01.617 --> 01:25:03.451
George, aren't you going to kiss me?

1260
01:25:03.535 --> 01:25:05.036
I don't know.

1261
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:08.956
Scram, McFly. I'm cutting in.

1262
01:25:15.964 --> 01:25:19.926
Earth angel, Earth angel

1263
01:25:20.594 --> 01:25:22.428
The one I adore

1264
01:25:22.513 --> 01:25:24.514
Hey, boy, you all right?

1265
01:25:25.641 --> 01:25:27.099
I can't play.

1266
01:25:27.184 --> 01:25:28.267
George!

1267
01:25:45.744 --> 01:25:46.994
George!

1268
01:25:48.413 --> 01:25:49.580
George.

1269
01:25:52.626 --> 01:25:54.043
Excuse me.

1270
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:06.097
The vision of your happiness

1271
01:26:08.267 --> 01:26:11.477
Earth angel, Earth angel

1272
01:26:12.145 --> 01:26:15.356
Please be mine

1273
01:26:15.941 --> 01:26:18.067
My darling dear

1274
01:26:18.402 --> 01:26:21.445
Love you for all time

1275
01:26:22.239 --> 01:26:25.491
I'm just a fool

1276
01:26:26.577 --> 01:26:29.620
A fool in love

1277
01:26:30.873 --> 01:26:34.292
with you

1278
01:26:41.133 --> 01:26:45.052
Yeah, man, that was good.
Let's do another one.

1279
01:26:45.137 --> 01:26:47.054
No. I got to go.

1280
01:26:47.139 --> 01:26:50.641
Come on, man. Let's do
something that really cooks.

1281
01:26:50.726 --> 01:26:53.519
Something that cooks.

1282
01:26:58.901 --> 01:26:59.942
All right.

1283
01:27:00.027 --> 01:27:01.027
All right!

1284
01:27:05.032 --> 01:27:06.407
All right.

1285
01:27:07.326 --> 01:27:10.745
All right, this is an oldie, but...

1286
01:27:12.748 --> 01:27:16.125
Well, it's an oldie where I come from.

1287
01:27:18.170 --> 01:27:20.421
All right, guys, listen,
this is a blues riff in B.

1288
01:27:20.505 --> 01:27:23.549
Watch me for the changes,
and try and keep up, okay?

1289
01:27:40.484 --> 01:27:43.319
Way down in
Louisiana Down in New Orleans

1290
01:27:43.403 --> 01:27:46.155
Way back up in the woods
among the evergreens

1291
01:27:46.281 --> 01:27:49.075
There stood a log cabin
made of earth and wood

1292
01:27:49.201 --> 01:27:51.786
Where lived a country boy
name of Johnny B. Goode

1293
01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.538
He never ever learned
to read or write so well

1294
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:57.208
He could play the guitar
just like he's ringing a bell

1295
01:27:57.334 --> 01:28:01.295
Go, go Go, Johnny, go, go

1296
01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.881
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1297
01:28:04.758 --> 01:28:06.300
Go, Johnny, go, go

1298
01:28:06.385 --> 01:28:09.011
Hey, George, I heard you
laid out Biff. Nice going.

1299
01:28:09.096 --> 01:28:11.389
George, you ever think of
running for class president?

1300
01:28:11.473 --> 01:28:13.891
Johnny B. Goode

1301
01:28:16.228 --> 01:28:18.896
Go, Johnny, go, go

1302
01:28:18.981 --> 01:28:21.649
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1303
01:28:21.733 --> 01:28:24.485
Go, Johnny, go, go

1304
01:28:24.569 --> 01:28:26.779
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1305
01:28:28.365 --> 01:28:30.241
Johnny B. Goode

1306
01:28:32.494 --> 01:28:35.329
Chuck! Chuck, it's Marvin.

1307
01:28:35.414 --> 01:28:37.999
Your cousin, Marvin Berry.

1308
01:28:38.083 --> 01:28:40.835
You know that new sound
you're looking for?

1309
01:28:40.919 --> 01:28:42.795
Well, listen to this.

1310
01:29:52.365 --> 01:29:55.326
I guess you guys aren't
ready for that yet.

1311
01:29:56.661 --> 01:29:58.287
But your kids are going to love it.

1312
01:30:02.542 --> 01:30:03.918
Lorraine.

1313
01:30:04.002 --> 01:30:06.587
Marty, that was very interesting music.

1314
01:30:06.671 --> 01:30:08.255
Yeah.

1315
01:30:08.799 --> 01:30:10.257
I hope you don't mind,

1316
01:30:10.342 --> 01:30:12.384
but George asked if
he could take me home.

1317
01:30:12.636 --> 01:30:15.554
Great! Good. Good, Lorraine.

1318
01:30:15.639 --> 01:30:17.056
I had a feeling about you two.

1319
01:30:17.516 --> 01:30:19.475
I have a feeling, too.

1320
01:30:19.851 --> 01:30:21.227
Listen, I got to go,

1321
01:30:21.311 --> 01:30:26.023
but I wanted to tell you
that it's been educational.

1322
01:30:27.067 --> 01:30:29.527
Marty, will we ever see you again?

1323
01:30:30.737 --> 01:30:31.946
I guarantee it.

1324
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:35.449
Well, Marty, I want to thank
you for all your good advice.

1325
01:30:35.534 --> 01:30:37.868
I'll never forget it.

1326
01:30:38.578 --> 01:30:40.162
Right, George.

1327
01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:45.042
Well, good luck, you guys.

1328
01:30:46.628 --> 01:30:47.711
Oh!

1329
01:30:49.047 --> 01:30:52.967
One other thing. If
you guys ever have kids,

1330
01:30:53.051 --> 01:30:55.469
and one of them, when
he's eight years old,

1331
01:30:55.554 --> 01:30:58.556
accidentally sets fire
to the living room rug,

1332
01:30:59.891 --> 01:31:01.517
go easy on him.

1333
01:31:02.519 --> 01:31:03.811
Okay.

1334
01:31:08.692 --> 01:31:11.527
Marty. Such a nice name.

1335
01:31:17.492 --> 01:31:19.618
Damn! Where is that kid?

1336
01:31:22.831 --> 01:31:24.081
Damn!

1337
01:31:26.543 --> 01:31:27.918
Damn! Damn!

1338
01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:38.637
You're late! Do you
have no concept of time?

1339
01:31:38.722 --> 01:31:41.098
Hey, come on. I had to change.

1340
01:31:41.183 --> 01:31:44.101
Do you think I'm going
back in that zoot suit?

1341
01:31:44.186 --> 01:31:46.854
The old man really
came through. It worked.

1342
01:31:46.938 --> 01:31:49.023
He laid out Biff in one punch.

1343
01:31:49.107 --> 01:31:50.191
I didn't know he had it in him.

1344
01:31:50.275 --> 01:31:53.485
He's never stood up to Biff in his life.

1345
01:31:54.863 --> 01:31:56.030
Never?

1346
01:31:56.114 --> 01:31:57.865
No. Why? What's the matter?

1347
01:31:58.950 --> 01:32:02.661
All right! Let's set
your destination time.

1348
01:32:07.417 --> 01:32:09.752
This is the exact time you left.

1349
01:32:10.128 --> 01:32:13.589
Let's send you back at
exactly the same time.

1350
01:32:16.468 --> 01:32:18.677
It'll be like you never left.

1351
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:24.850
Now, I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

1352
01:32:24.935 --> 01:32:26.810
That's where you'll start from.

1353
01:32:26.895 --> 01:32:29.230
I've calculated the precise distance,

1354
01:32:29.314 --> 01:32:31.982
taking into account
the acceleration speed

1355
01:32:32.067 --> 01:32:33.817
and wind resistance retroactive

1356
01:32:33.902 --> 01:32:36.528
from the moment the lightning strikes,

1357
01:32:36.613 --> 01:32:41.116
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

1358
01:32:41.493 --> 01:32:43.869
When this alarm goes
off, you hit the gas.

1359
01:32:43.954 --> 01:32:45.037
Right.

1360
01:32:51.836 --> 01:32:54.880
Well, I guess that's everything.

1361
01:32:59.094 --> 01:33:00.552
Thanks.

1362
01:33:00.637 --> 01:33:01.845
Thank you.

1363
01:33:06.851 --> 01:33:08.978
See you in about 30 years.

1364
01:33:10.689 --> 01:33:12.022
I hope so.

1365
01:33:13.692 --> 01:33:15.234
Don't worry!

1366
01:33:15.902 --> 01:33:17.611
As long as you hit that wire

1367
01:33:17.696 --> 01:33:20.781
with the connecting hook at
precisely 88 miles an hour,

1368
01:33:20.865 --> 01:33:23.867
the instant the lightning
strikes the tower

1369
01:33:26.329 --> 01:33:27.454
everything will be fine.

1370
01:33:27.539 --> 01:33:28.706
Right.

1371
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:39.550
What's the meaning of this?

1372
01:33:39.634 --> 01:33:41.302
You'll find out in 30 years.

1373
01:33:41.386 --> 01:33:43.470
It's about the future, isn't it?

1374
01:33:43.555 --> 01:33:44.638
It's information about the future.

1375
01:33:44.723 --> 01:33:46.265
Wait a minute.

1376
01:33:46.349 --> 01:33:48.267
I warned you about this, kid.

1377
01:33:48.351 --> 01:33:51.186
The consequences could be disastrous!

1378
01:33:51.271 --> 01:33:53.689
Doc, that's a risk you're
going to have to take.

1379
01:33:53.773 --> 01:33:55.357
Your life depends on it!

1380
01:33:55.442 --> 01:33:56.608
No!

1381
01:33:57.068 --> 01:34:00.404
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

1382
01:34:00.739 --> 01:34:02.698
In that case, I'll
tell you straight out.

1383
01:34:07.454 --> 01:34:08.871
Great Scott!

1384
01:34:16.796 --> 01:34:19.840
You get the cable, I'll
throw the rope down to you.

1385
01:34:19.924 --> 01:34:21.717
Right! I got it!

1386
01:34:55.919 --> 01:34:57.169
Doc!

1387
01:35:04.803 --> 01:35:06.387
Come on, come on. Let's go!

1388
01:35:06.471 --> 01:35:09.139
All right! Take it up!

1389
01:35:12.352 --> 01:35:13.477
Go!

1390
01:35:20.527 --> 01:35:21.527
Doc!

1391
01:35:21.611 --> 01:35:22.653
What?

1392
01:35:22.821 --> 01:35:26.156
I have to tell you about the future.

1393
01:35:26.366 --> 01:35:27.408
What?

1394
01:35:27.492 --> 01:35:30.744
I have to tell you about the future!

1395
01:35:30.829 --> 01:35:32.162
What?

1396
01:35:32.247 --> 01:35:37.084
On the night I go back
in time, you get...

1397
01:35:40.588 --> 01:35:41.839
Doc!

1398
01:35:51.099 --> 01:35:52.307
Go!

1399
01:35:53.184 --> 01:35:54.268
No, Doc!

1400
01:35:54.352 --> 01:35:55.602
Look at the time!

1401
01:35:55.687 --> 01:35:59.690
You've got less than four
minutes. Please, hurry!

1402
01:36:11.286 --> 01:36:12.619
Yeah!

1403
01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:09.134
Damn it, Doc! Why did you
have to tear up that letter?

1404
01:37:09.219 --> 01:37:11.178
If I only had more time.

1405
01:37:14.182 --> 01:37:16.558
Wait a minute. I got
all the time I want.

1406
01:37:16.643 --> 01:37:20.229
I got a time machine. I can
just go back early and warn him.

1407
01:37:20.313 --> 01:37:22.856
Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.

1408
01:37:24.984 --> 01:37:29.696
Okay. Time circuit's on.
Flux capacitor, fluxing.

1409
01:37:30.156 --> 01:37:32.282
Engine running. All right.

1410
01:37:35.078 --> 01:37:37.120
No. No, no.

1411
01:37:38.665 --> 01:37:40.874
Come on. Not this
time. Come on. Come on.

1412
01:38:51.321 --> 01:38:52.613
Come on.

1413
01:38:54.699 --> 01:38:57.826
Here we go. Here we
go. This time. Come on.

1414
01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.997
Please. Please. Come on!

1415
01:40:40.346 --> 01:40:41.722
Doc.

1416
01:42:17.902 --> 01:42:19.986
Crazy drunk driver.

1417
01:42:30.498 --> 01:42:31.915
Whoo!

1418
01:42:35.127 --> 01:42:37.379
All right. Fred.

1419
01:42:38.881 --> 01:42:41.675
You look great. Everything looks great.

1420
01:42:42.927 --> 01:42:46.930
1:24. I still got time. I'm coming, Doc!

1421
01:42:50.601 --> 01:42:55.355
No! No, not again! Come on! Come on!

1422
01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:10.453
Libyans.

1423
01:43:33.102 --> 01:43:34.144
No!

1424
01:43:35.479 --> 01:43:36.980
You bastard!

1425
01:43:50.328 --> 01:43:51.661
Go!

1426
01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:28.156
Doc! Doc!

1427
01:44:33.621 --> 01:44:35.789
No! No!

1428
01:44:50.721 --> 01:44:52.222
You're alive.

1429
01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.066
Bulletproof vest?

1430
01:45:04.402 --> 01:45:06.069
How did you know?

1431
01:45:06.862 --> 01:45:09.280
I never got a chance to tell you.

1432
01:45:22.837 --> 01:45:26.881
What about all that talk about
screwing up future events?

1433
01:45:26.966 --> 01:45:29.050
The space-time continuum?

1434
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:32.429
Well, I figured, what the hell?

1435
01:45:42.648 --> 01:45:44.607
So, how far ahead are you going?

1436
01:45:44.692 --> 01:45:47.694
About 30 years. It's
a nice, round number.

1437
01:45:47.778 --> 01:45:52.240
Look me up when you get there,
all right? Guess I'll be about 47.

1438
01:45:52.324 --> 01:45:53.575
I will.

1439
01:45:53.993 --> 01:45:55.410
Take care.

1440
01:45:56.162 --> 01:45:57.370
You, too.

1441
01:45:57.455 --> 01:45:59.789
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.

1442
01:46:00.291 --> 01:46:03.293
Oh. And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

1443
01:46:04.003 --> 01:46:05.295
You bet.

1444
01:47:10.277 --> 01:47:11.903
What a nightmare.

1445
01:47:23.249 --> 01:47:26.209
If Paul calls me, tell him I'm
working at the boutique late tonight.

1446
01:47:26.293 --> 01:47:28.378
Linda, first of all,
I'm not your answering service,

1447
01:47:28.462 --> 01:47:30.004
second of all, somebody named Greg

1448
01:47:30.089 --> 01:47:31.965
or Craig called you
just a little while ago.

1449
01:47:32.049 --> 01:47:33.633
Well, which one was it, Greg or Craig?

1450
01:47:33.717 --> 01:47:36.427
I don't know! I can't keep up
with all of your boyfriends.

1451
01:47:36.512 --> 01:47:37.637
Hey.

1452
01:47:38.681 --> 01:47:40.390
What the hell is this?

1453
01:47:41.142 --> 01:47:42.225
Breakfast.

1454
01:47:42.726 --> 01:47:45.145
Did you sleep in your
clothes again last night?

1455
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:46.563
Yeah. I...

1456
01:47:47.565 --> 01:47:50.108
Yeah. What are you wearing, Dave?

1457
01:47:50.401 --> 01:47:53.236
Marty, I always wear
a suit to the office.

1458
01:47:54.947 --> 01:47:56.781
You all right? Yeah.

1459
01:47:57.575 --> 01:47:58.658
I think we
need a rematch, George.

1460
01:47:58.742 --> 01:47:59.784
A rematch?

1461
01:47:59.869 --> 01:48:00.910
Why? Were you cheating?

1462
01:48:00.995 --> 01:48:01.995
No.

1463
01:48:02.079 --> 01:48:03.955
Hello. Good morning.

1464
01:48:06.041 --> 01:48:07.542
Mom! Dad!

1465
01:48:07.918 --> 01:48:09.502
Did you hit your head?
Marty, are you all right?

1466
01:48:09.587 --> 01:48:13.590
You guys look great.
Mom, you look so thin.

1467
01:48:13.924 --> 01:48:16.467
Why, thank you, Marty. George!

1468
01:48:17.928 --> 01:48:20.013
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1469
01:48:20.931 --> 01:48:22.307
Good morning, Dave. Linda.

1470
01:48:22.391 --> 01:48:23.766
Good morning, Mom.

1471
01:48:23.851 --> 01:48:26.352
Marty, I almost
forgot. Jennifer Parker called.

1472
01:48:26.437 --> 01:48:30.064
I sure like her, Marty.
She is such a sweet girl.

1473
01:48:30.608 --> 01:48:32.609
Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

1474
01:48:32.693 --> 01:48:34.652
What? What, Ma?

1475
01:48:34.737 --> 01:48:36.112
Aren't you going up to the lake tonight?

1476
01:48:36.197 --> 01:48:38.865
You've been planning it for two weeks.

1477
01:48:38.949 --> 01:48:41.618
Mom, we talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

1478
01:48:41.702 --> 01:48:42.827
The car's wrecked.

1479
01:48:42.912 --> 01:48:44.495
Wrecked? Wrecked?

1480
01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:45.705
When did this happen? Why wasn't I told?

1481
01:48:45.789 --> 01:48:46.789
Quiet down.

1482
01:48:46.874 --> 01:48:48.374
I'm sure the car is fine.

1483
01:48:48.459 --> 01:48:50.710
Why am I always the last
one to know about these things?

1484
01:48:50.794 --> 01:48:53.880
See? There's Biff out
there waxing it right now.

1485
01:48:54.298 --> 01:48:55.715
Now, Biff, I want to make sure that

1486
01:48:55.799 --> 01:48:58.635
we get two coats of wax
this time, not just one.

1487
01:48:58.719 --> 01:49:00.303
I'm just finishing up
the second coat now.

1488
01:49:00.387 --> 01:49:02.972
Now, Biff, don't con me.

1489
01:49:04.475 --> 01:49:06.517
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1490
01:49:06.602 --> 01:49:09.687
I meant I was just
starting on the second coat.

1491
01:49:10.773 --> 01:49:14.609
Biff. What a character. Always
trying to get away with something.

1492
01:49:15.110 --> 01:49:18.071
I've had to stay on top of
Biff ever since high school.

1493
01:49:18.155 --> 01:49:20.240
Although, if it wasn't for him...

1494
01:49:20.324 --> 01:49:21.908
We never would have fallen in love.

1495
01:49:21.992 --> 01:49:23.451
That's right.

1496
01:49:23.994 --> 01:49:26.704
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

1497
01:49:26.789 --> 01:49:29.582
Oh, hi, Marty. I think
it's your new book.

1498
01:49:32.169 --> 01:49:36.005
Honey! Your first novel.

1499
01:49:36.090 --> 01:49:37.131
Like I've always told you,

1500
01:49:37.216 --> 01:49:40.134
you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

1501
01:49:40.219 --> 01:49:42.720
Oh, Marty, here's your keys.

1502
01:49:42.805 --> 01:49:44.597
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

1503
01:49:45.182 --> 01:49:46.349
Keys?

1504
01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:04.325
How about a ride, mister?

1505
01:50:04.410 --> 01:50:05.535
Jennifer.

1506
01:50:06.495 --> 01:50:10.623
Oh, are you a sight for sore
eyes! Let me look at you.

1507
01:50:11.375 --> 01:50:14.252
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

1508
01:50:14.336 --> 01:50:15.753
I haven't.

1509
01:50:16.338 --> 01:50:19.590
You okay? Is everything all right?

1510
01:50:22.886 --> 01:50:24.012
Oh, yeah.

1511
01:50:26.223 --> 01:50:28.016
Everything is great.

1512
01:50:42.239 --> 01:50:46.492
Marty! You've got to come back with me!

1513
01:50:47.286 --> 01:50:48.494
Where?

1514
01:50:48.579 --> 01:50:49.746
Back to the future.

1515
01:50:54.376 --> 01:50:56.502
Wait a minute. What are you doing, Doc?

1516
01:50:57.504 --> 01:50:58.588
I need fuel.

1517
01:51:02.051 --> 01:51:04.469
Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.

1518
01:51:04.553 --> 01:51:06.596
No, no. Doc, I just got here, okay?

1519
01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:08.681
Jennifer's here. We're gonna
take the new truck for a spin.

1520
01:51:08.766 --> 01:51:12.018
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.

1521
01:51:12.102 --> 01:51:13.686
Wait a minute, Doc. What
are you talking about?

1522
01:51:13.771 --> 01:51:15.813
What happens to us in the future?

1523
01:51:15.898 --> 01:51:17.648
Do we become assholes or something?

1524
01:51:17.733 --> 01:51:18.858
No, no, no, no, Marty.

1525
01:51:18.942 --> 01:51:20.693
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.

1526
01:51:20.778 --> 01:51:22.236
It's your kids, Marty.

1527
01:51:22.321 --> 01:51:24.572
Something has got to
be done about your kids.

1528
01:51:30.954 --> 01:51:34.040
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't
have enough road to get up to 88.

1529
01:51:34.124 --> 01:51:38.294
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.
