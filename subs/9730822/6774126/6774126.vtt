00:00:35.603 --> 00:00:36.638
What?

3
00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:39.206
♪ Today is your birthday ♪

4
00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.643
- ♪ It's my birthday too ♪
- It's not my birthday,

5
00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:43.477
you piece of shit.

6
00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:45.145
Every day is your birthday,

7
00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:46.781
and today is the gift
of conversation.

8
00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:48.550
I don't want your conversation.

9
00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:51.786
Your voice is making me
wanna pour Drano down my ears.

10
00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:54.656
Aww, that's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me!

11
00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:57.190
I love you so much,
I'll take that to my...

12
00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:13.875
- Mm.
- Mm.

13
00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:14.876
Can I help you?

14
00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.209
I didn't mean
to blow you off last night,

15
00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:17.344
okay?

16
00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.412
Okay.

17
00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:19.246
Wait!

18
00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.715
I took two Nyquil
and passed out.

19
00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:23.518
I didn't wake up until
after midnight, I swear.

20
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:25.520
I put on normal clothes for you.

21
00:01:25.553 --> 00:01:26.821
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:30.792
But I got you Pedialyte
and a burrito.

23
00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:32.560
I think it's cheese.

24
00:01:32.594 --> 00:01:34.529
I assumed you might need it
after the very aggressive

25
00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:36.764
and slurred hate message
you left me.

26
00:01:36.798 --> 00:01:40.300
- Don't make any jokes.
- Right. Sorry.

27
00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:42.202
Can I come in?

28
00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:43.805
Please?

29
00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:47.508
You're, uh, glowing today,
by the way.

30
00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:49.242
You are! You're...
you're beautiful,

31
00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:50.878
you're a queen,
I'm serious, please.

32
00:01:50.912 --> 00:01:52.379
If you do that again,

33
00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:54.882
you better ingest
every Nyquil pill you own.

34
00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:56.416
Done.

35
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.419
- I'm serious.
- I... fuckin' promise.

36
00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:00.822
Okay, then,
wipe that smile off your face!

37
00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:03.591
I'm... I'm trying, but it's...

38
00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:05.893
- I'm serious.
- Can I fuckin' enter, or...

39
00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:16.303
Uh-uh-uh!

40
00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:17.805
What?

41
00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.439
Burrito.

42
00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:20.608
Mm.

43
00:02:25.947 --> 00:02:27.280
Thank you.

44
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:32.352
Uh! Scratch my back.

45
00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:36.456
All right.

46
00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:42.396
- Like this?
- Harder.

47
00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.398
Down.

48
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.499
- Mm.
- Mm-hm.

49
00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.467
To the left a little.

50
00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:48.936
Yeah.

51
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.438
Do that one thing
that I like.

52
00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.240
Mm-hm.

53
00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.809
- That's not what I like!
- This one thing.

54
00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:56.209
- No.
- I'm outta here.

55
00:02:56.243 --> 00:02:57.310
No!

56
00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.914
Nathan, stop.

57
00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:01.649
Ouch!

58
00:03:01.683 --> 00:03:02.750
Ow.

59
00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:05.887
- No.
- What?

60
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.755
- Stop.
- Keep going?

61
00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:10.925
- Oh, I make you so wet!
- You a good boy?

62
00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.827
You gonna do everything
I tell you to do?

63
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.795
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

64
00:03:13.828 --> 00:03:14.662
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

65
00:03:14.696 --> 00:03:16.430
- Yes.
- Okay, keep fucking me, then.

66
00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:18.766
Harder, you little bitch!

67
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.835
Always such a fucking pussy!

68
00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:22.369
Fucking me.

69
00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:23.638
Don't come yet.

70
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:25.472
- Hold it in!
- Oh, I'm so close!

71
00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:28.643
Oh, I'm sorry!

72
00:03:45.727 --> 00:03:48.261
All right.

73
00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.534
Oh, man.

74
00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:06.581
Um... yeah, can I get
a white chocolate mocha...

75
00:04:06.614 --> 00:04:08.482
decaf?

76
00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:12.887
Oh, and with skim milk,
not regular milk.

77
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.488
Size?

78
00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:16.289
Um...

79
00:04:20.628 --> 00:04:21.863
Medium.

80
00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:24.331
Oh wait, no, no... large.

81
00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.833
Actually...

82
00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:30.037
Can I get a medium
in a large cup

83
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:33.440
with extra whipped cream?

84
00:04:35.877 --> 00:04:38.679
Yeah, sure.
Anything else?

85
00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:41.916
Oh yeah. Can I get
one of those low-cal bagels?

86
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:47.588
Oh, um, the freshest one?

87
00:04:47.622 --> 00:04:51.993
No... not that one.
The one in the back.

88
00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:55.897
Hey, man, you wanna
do your job?

89
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.832
I'm trying to get an education,

90
00:04:57.865 --> 00:04:59.801
make a better life for myself.

91
00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:01.936
- You're reading manga.
- Yeah.

92
00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.005
- Hm.
- Does that turn you on?

93
00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:06.908
A cultured man reading
Japanese literature?

94
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:09.644
My vagina has literally
never been so dry.

95
00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:10.611
I'm into that.

96
00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:12.613
- Just like...
- Fine.

97
00:05:12.647 --> 00:05:14.381
Sage?

98
00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:15.750
A word.

99
00:05:15.783 --> 00:05:16.918
Kyle.

100
00:05:20.555 --> 00:05:22.990
Sage, it's all about keeping
the order side of the cup

101
00:05:23.024 --> 00:05:24.792
facing out.

102
00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:27.762
Expedited service,
keeping it smooth, slick.

103
00:05:27.795 --> 00:05:32.432
After all, we are
a well-oiled machine.

104
00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:33.801
- Yes.
- Got it.

105
00:05:33.835 --> 00:05:37.638
Good, good, good.
Also... ahem...

106
00:05:37.672 --> 00:05:40.373
We need to discuss
your upsell tactics?

107
00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:41.108
Mm-hm.

108
00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:46.848
You know, this was brewed
by Somalian street orphans.

109
00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:50.518
Lot of children had to die
for this coffee.

110
00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:53.154
Here.

111
00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:55.756
Take it.
It's yours.

112
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.592
Take it.

113
00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:58.759
Goodbye.

114
00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:00.493
Enjoy!

115
00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:02.930
Think about it like
carpe diem.

116
00:06:02.964 --> 00:06:04.866
Seize the opportunity.

117
00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:08.435
Make them want
what they don't have.

118
00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:09.537
We're a model store.

119
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.806
Other locations
look up to us.

120
00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.574
I mean, it's like
we are delivering

121
00:06:13.608 --> 00:06:15.643
the opiate of the masses.

122
00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:18.411
It's... it's a domino effect,

123
00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:21.782
really.

124
00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:23.951
Okay.

125
00:06:23.985 --> 00:06:25.019
- Was that it?
- Yeah, that's all,

126
00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:27.487
back to the register.

127
00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:30.191
All right, people,
let's keep it moving.

128
00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:41.168
Hey, Sage!

129
00:06:41.202 --> 00:06:43.604
C'mere, come on.

130
00:06:43.638 --> 00:06:45.873
I just... I don't want
you to forget

131
00:06:45.907 --> 00:06:49.577
to wipe down the tables,
so...

132
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.545
this is for you!

133
00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:54.615
I hope you choke on your vomit
and die in your sleep.

134
00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:56.784
Stop flirting with me
in the workplace.

135
00:06:56.817 --> 00:06:58.686
This is a sacred environment!

136
00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:00.721
Fine! I'll go out with you!

137
00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:01.923
Come back.
Please come back.

138
00:07:01.956 --> 00:07:03.090
No.

139
00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:08.930
I really can't tell
if I'm turned on

140
00:07:08.963 --> 00:07:10.898
or if I wanna, like,
gouge out his eyes

141
00:07:10.932 --> 00:07:12.900
and force-feed him
his own testicles, you know?

142
00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:14.902
Ooh! That, I can
get on board with.

143
00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:16.469
How many times
is he gonna upset you

144
00:07:16.504 --> 00:07:18.940
before you realize
you just gotta move on?

145
00:07:18.973 --> 00:07:20.241
I suck at this game.

146
00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:22.009
You gotta give
more hand jobs.

147
00:07:22.043 --> 00:07:24.512
Exercise that wrist.

148
00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.647
- Nobody likes hand jobs.
- Whoa.

149
00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:28.215
Seventh-graders like hand jobs.

150
00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:29.517
That's true.

151
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.152
- Ew.
- You could masturbate.

152
00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:32.853
I hate masturbating.

153
00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:35.623
What did you say?

154
00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:36.891
My arm gets tired.

155
00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:38.059
Better start
flickin' that clit.

156
00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:39.593
Ew, stop!

157
00:07:39.627 --> 00:07:40.661
You really need
to get more comfortable

158
00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:42.029
with your sexuality.

159
00:07:42.063 --> 00:07:43.664
It has nothing to do
with my sexuality.

160
00:07:43.698 --> 00:07:45.166
I just don't like that word.

161
00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:47.001
- "Clit"?
- Yes.

162
00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:48.636
Or it really might be
your sexuality.

163
00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:51.005
- Thank you.
- I love sex!

164
00:07:51.038 --> 00:07:54.108
Cum! Penis! Vagina! Areola!

165
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:55.142
Tip of the dick!

166
00:07:55.176 --> 00:07:56.911
I don't fuckin' know,
I just don't like

167
00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:58.646
that specific word.

168
00:08:01.082 --> 00:08:02.550
Oh, shit!

169
00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:03.751
Eight!

170
00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:05.786
Sorry, Casey, you lose.

171
00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:09.824
So you can swallow jizz
but you can't take down

172
00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:12.159
two ounces of tequila?

173
00:08:12.193 --> 00:08:14.562
I don't swallow.

174
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:18.833
What do you do in bed?

175
00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:22.169
You swallow?

176
00:08:22.203 --> 00:08:23.637
Duh.

177
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:28.175
Do you swallow?

178
00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:31.312
It depends on the guy, but...
yeah.

179
00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:35.649
I mean, the consistency!
It's like...

180
00:08:35.683 --> 00:08:37.585
melted rubber.

181
00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:40.054
That's why you gotta...
deep-throat

182
00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:41.622
and just let it shoot back.

183
00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:43.224
It also sounds like
he might be eating something

184
00:08:43.257 --> 00:08:44.425
that he should not be eating.

185
00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:46.227
I don't know, I think
I'm just not a texture person

186
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.495
or something.

187
00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:50.331
You can't complain about cum
until you've had Jason Michaels

188
00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:52.199
blow his wad all over you.

189
00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:55.136
I forgot about Jason.

190
00:08:55.169 --> 00:08:57.638
- Who was Jason?
- Junk jizz.

191
00:08:57.671 --> 00:09:00.241
A piece of jizz literally
flew out of his dick

192
00:09:00.274 --> 00:09:02.610
onto my hand.

193
00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:05.613
Like the peelable glue
that you get

194
00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:08.215
in magazine perfume samples.

195
00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:12.620
That's repulsive.

196
00:09:12.653 --> 00:09:13.788
Not as bad
as Colgate jizz.

197
00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:15.189
- Debatable.
- No!

198
00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:16.791
- Yes!
- It's so much worse!

199
00:09:16.824 --> 00:09:17.758
- Go.
- Okay.

200
00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:19.193
This guy, when he came,
it was literally like

201
00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:20.428
squeezing a tube of toothpaste.

202
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:25.132
The jizz just, like, spiraled
out of the tip of his dick.

203
00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:26.700
Does that sound right to you?

204
00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:28.135
Does that sound right
to you?

205
00:09:28.169 --> 00:09:31.272
- That is rich.
- Gross adjectives.

206
00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:32.973
Why do you guys
do this to me?

207
00:09:33.007 --> 00:09:34.775
And now you have rubber jizz,
so, you know,

208
00:09:34.809 --> 00:09:36.677
it's like we're a team.

209
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.379
Worst league ever.

210
00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:40.848
Whatever, man.

211
00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:42.316
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

212
00:09:42.349 --> 00:09:44.285
I need to start handling
my own prints,

213
00:09:44.318 --> 00:09:47.054
because I'm making, like,
$2 through a third party.

214
00:09:47.088 --> 00:09:48.322
It's a total scam.

215
00:09:48.355 --> 00:09:49.423
- Hm.
- Well, better start wearing

216
00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:52.393
low-cut shirts to work
and rack up that tip money.

217
00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:55.129
Okay, yeah, first of all,
I don't have boobs,

218
00:09:55.162 --> 00:09:56.831
if you didn't notice;
secondly,

219
00:09:56.864 --> 00:09:58.265
please do not bring up work.

220
00:09:58.299 --> 00:09:59.333
I'll drink to that.

221
00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:01.936
What? I thought the
publishing house was going well.

222
00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:05.106
An unpaid internship's
not really helping with rent.

223
00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:06.307
You're still interning?

224
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.441
I guess they're hesitant
to move someone up

225
00:10:07.475 --> 00:10:11.112
with no college credentials
and a late-in-life GED.

226
00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:13.013
I have a degree
and I serve coffee for a living,

227
00:10:13.047 --> 00:10:14.815
if that makes you feel better.

228
00:10:14.849 --> 00:10:16.750
It does! Thank you.

229
00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:18.285
Yeah, but that's an art degree.

230
00:10:18.319 --> 00:10:20.154
Wow.

231
00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:22.389
Thank you for putting my failure
into perspective.

232
00:10:22.423 --> 00:10:25.126
Okay, I didn't mean it
like that.

233
00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:27.228
I just...

234
00:10:27.261 --> 00:10:28.896
There's no, like,
set career path.

235
00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:30.664
Oh, believe me, I would much
rather have a career

236
00:10:30.698 --> 00:10:33.367
with a path as clear-cut
as selling insurance.

237
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.102
Okay.

238
00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:37.204
It's a transitional job.

239
00:10:37.238 --> 00:10:39.240
And it pays well.

240
00:10:39.273 --> 00:10:41.175
Not that that money's
actually enjoyed.

241
00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:42.776
I love your dad,

242
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.211
but he's draining you dry,
honey.

243
00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:46.714
And how, exactly,
are you paying for things?

244
00:10:46.747 --> 00:10:48.649
- Savings.
- Hm.

245
00:10:49.817 --> 00:10:51.752
I don't have a lot of time.

246
00:10:51.785 --> 00:10:53.954
My conference is in 20 minutes.

247
00:10:53.988 --> 00:10:56.223
That's plenty.

248
00:10:56.257 --> 00:10:57.391
Sit down.

249
00:11:09.203 --> 00:11:10.871
Take off my pants.

250
00:11:29.757 --> 00:11:31.825
- Oh no, I'm good, thank you.
- Drink it.

251
00:11:38.032 --> 00:11:40.301
Look at me.

252
00:11:40.334 --> 00:11:41.735
Yeah.

253
00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:45.039
Just like that.

254
00:11:45.072 --> 00:11:46.173
Keep drinking.

255
00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:53.080
Tastes good, doesn't it?

256
00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:56.518
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

257
00:12:10.831 --> 00:12:14.401
Stop! Don't swallow!

258
00:12:14.435 --> 00:12:16.136
Oh, God!

259
00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:19.907
Slap me.

260
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.445
Harder.

261
00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:27.515
Hit me again.

262
00:12:27.549 --> 00:12:30.050
Hit me again!

263
00:12:30.084 --> 00:12:31.252
Now, the water!

264
00:12:31.285 --> 00:12:32.987
Spit it in my face!

265
00:12:50.505 --> 00:12:52.273
You can go now.

266
00:13:20.334 --> 00:13:21.603
There you go.

267
00:13:27.174 --> 00:13:30.978
I think it's best to keep
a positive perspective.

268
00:13:31.011 --> 00:13:32.479
I know this feels like
a low point,

269
00:13:32.514 --> 00:13:36.518
but perhaps this could be
a renewed beginning.

270
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:37.951
If you'd like to come in
twice a week,

271
00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:40.054
I do have an opening
on Thursdays.

272
00:15:57.124 --> 00:16:00.227
Medium latte,
triple shot, iced.

273
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.529
Ahem!

274
00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:09.737
Are you sure
you wouldn't like a large

275
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:12.105
for just 25 cents more?

276
00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:16.711
I'm sure that
I'd like a medium.

277
00:16:16.744 --> 00:16:18.312
Because if I wanted a large,

278
00:16:18.345 --> 00:16:20.047
I would have ordered a large.

279
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.415
And I'm also sure
that I can't be late

280
00:16:21.448 --> 00:16:23.350
to a very important meeting,
so,

281
00:16:23.383 --> 00:16:25.687
if you could do your job
quickly

282
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.722
and get me the medium iced latte
I ordered,

283
00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:30.324
I can give you this as a tip

284
00:16:30.357 --> 00:16:32.259
and we can say our goodbyes.

285
00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:37.130
Okay.

286
00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:38.766
Anything else?

287
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.178
Thanks.

288
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.719
- Hello.
- Hi.

289
00:16:57.752 --> 00:16:59.253
Are you gonna help us close?

290
00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:00.755
Uh, no thanks.

291
00:17:00.788 --> 00:17:01.723
Okay, cool!

292
00:17:01.756 --> 00:17:05.392
Just remember,
drive fast and take chances!

293
00:17:08.328 --> 00:17:09.463
Here.

294
00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:13.300
That is a solid amount of cash
to be flaunting.

295
00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:16.571
Don't get overzealous
and spend it all in one place.

296
00:17:16.604 --> 00:17:18.640
- Seventeen dollars?
- America.

297
00:17:18.673 --> 00:17:20.140
Land of opportunity.

298
00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:21.643
No, I'm excited.

299
00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:23.310
It's the exact down payment
I needed for my ad, actually,

300
00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:24.746
so...

301
00:17:24.779 --> 00:17:25.813
Ha-ha! Hard work
really does pay off.

302
00:17:25.847 --> 00:17:28.115
It does!

303
00:17:28.148 --> 00:17:29.449
So.

304
00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:30.484
How's the art stuff?

305
00:17:30.518 --> 00:17:33.521
It's good, it's a nice,
consistent reminder

306
00:17:33.555 --> 00:17:35.757
of my unfulfilled potential.

307
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.424
So I should expect
to see your work at the Getty

308
00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:38.693
in the near future.

309
00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:40.460
Oh yeah, any day now.

310
00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:42.262
You know, I really hope
they display the one

311
00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:44.866
with the, uh, Grim Reaper
and the coffee cup,

312
00:17:44.899 --> 00:17:47.267
I think that's my favorite.

313
00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:48.168
You asshole.

314
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:50.505
I couldn't help myself.

315
00:17:50.538 --> 00:17:51.673
I'm sorry!

316
00:17:51.706 --> 00:17:54.341
I saw an opportunity while
you were cleaning the bathroom!

317
00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:55.743
You're triggering
some very sensitive issues

318
00:17:55.777 --> 00:17:57.444
from my childhood right now,
please stop.

319
00:17:57.477 --> 00:17:58.345
Please stop.

320
00:17:58.378 --> 00:17:59.346
Ew! Get that out of my face
right now.

321
00:17:59.379 --> 00:18:00.414
I'm serious.

322
00:18:00.447 --> 00:18:01.749
No, you made
a very serious mistake.

323
00:18:01.783 --> 00:18:03.751
Okay. I have acne-prone skin.

324
00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:04.852
Why is it red?

325
00:18:04.886 --> 00:18:06.320
Because I used it to clean up
the menstrual blood

326
00:18:06.353 --> 00:18:07.555
in the women's stall.

327
00:18:07.589 --> 00:18:09.791
What the fuck? No! Ew! No!

328
00:18:09.824 --> 00:18:12.159
No, and my guess is
I'll really have you...

329
00:18:12.192 --> 00:18:13.795
Okay, please, I will do anything
to make it up to you.

330
00:18:13.828 --> 00:18:15.897
- Please stop!
- It's too late for that.

331
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.165
Okay, I have a bowl
in the back!

332
00:18:26.741 --> 00:18:28.509
Can I hit that yet?

333
00:18:29.877 --> 00:18:32.412
Nope.

334
00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:34.414
Can't believe you were gonna
wipe period on my face.

335
00:18:34.448 --> 00:18:36.416
It was strawberry syrup,
relax.

336
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.519
You think I'd touch that rag?

337
00:18:41.623 --> 00:18:44.224
Your work really is great.

338
00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:47.762
Yeah, well, you and Edna
seem to be the only two people

339
00:18:47.795 --> 00:18:49.664
that think that, so...

340
00:18:49.697 --> 00:18:51.164
- Edna?
- Oh yeah.

341
00:18:51.198 --> 00:18:53.266
She's a repeat Etsy customer
I have.

342
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.838
She's, like, 60, has a parrot,
and is a devout Wiccan,

343
00:18:56.871 --> 00:18:58.438
according to her profile.

344
00:18:58.472 --> 00:19:00.908
Whoa.

345
00:19:00.942 --> 00:19:03.811
Hey, at least you know
you have a wide target audience.

346
00:19:03.845 --> 00:19:05.880
I really think you should make,
like,

347
00:19:05.913 --> 00:19:09.550
a coffee table book
or something, you know?

348
00:19:09.584 --> 00:19:11.485
Yeah, and then sell it
to Urban Outfitters

349
00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:13.453
so edgy teens can purchase it?

350
00:19:13.487 --> 00:19:14.856
- Totally.
- Fuck you, I'm being serious.

351
00:19:14.889 --> 00:19:17.558
You can put, like, little
witty one-liners underneath.

352
00:19:17.592 --> 00:19:18.893
It'd be cool.

353
00:19:18.926 --> 00:19:21.261
No more input from you.

354
00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:24.666
Look. I'm just trying to keep
the artistic spirit alive.

355
00:19:24.699 --> 00:19:27.267
And I, for one, appreciate
your dark sense of humor.

356
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.671
It reminds me of this director
I've been getting into.

357
00:19:29.704 --> 00:19:31.506
He just did a movie
about a widowed mortician

358
00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:33.541
that falls in love
with one of his corpses,

359
00:19:33.574 --> 00:19:36.476
and, um, well, they're actually
screening it this week,

360
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:38.311
- I wanted to...
- No.

361
00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:39.681
Yeah, I mean, I get it,
you don't want to spend

362
00:19:39.714 --> 00:19:41.749
your hard-earned money
on movie tickets.

363
00:19:41.783 --> 00:19:43.951
Which, uh, happens
to work out perfectly,

364
00:19:43.985 --> 00:19:45.620
considering
I have two tickets.

365
00:19:45.653 --> 00:19:46.788
Kyle!

366
00:19:46.821 --> 00:19:49.691
- I know what you're gonna say.
- I don't date.

367
00:19:49.724 --> 00:19:50.792
Right.

368
00:19:50.825 --> 00:19:52.527
That's what I was getting to.

369
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.695
And I also don't like
saying no,

370
00:19:53.728 --> 00:19:56.597
so the less you ask,
the less I'll have to do that.

371
00:19:56.631 --> 00:19:58.298
For sure, for sure.

372
00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:00.802
Look. I respect
your life choices.

373
00:20:00.835 --> 00:20:02.904
I, um, I just think
you're missing

374
00:20:02.937 --> 00:20:04.739
a profound opportunity.

375
00:20:04.772 --> 00:20:07.508
Opportunity leads
to disappointment.

376
00:20:07.542 --> 00:20:09.510
See, and then you say
stuff like that

377
00:20:09.544 --> 00:20:12.580
and you lead me on
and it's cruel.

378
00:20:14.749 --> 00:20:16.349
It's not you.

379
00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:19.453
You know that.

380
00:20:19.486 --> 00:20:20.722
What?

381
00:20:24.357 --> 00:20:26.426
Okay.

382
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.929
We flirt, right?

383
00:20:27.962 --> 00:20:28.863
We hook up.

384
00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:29.797
We date for two years.

385
00:20:29.831 --> 00:20:30.965
Shit hits the fan,

386
00:20:30.998 --> 00:20:33.000
we take another two years
to call it off, and by then,

387
00:20:33.034 --> 00:20:35.703
we're, like, 30
with nothing but wasted time,

388
00:20:35.737 --> 00:20:37.270
wasted youth,
wasted emotions,

389
00:20:37.304 --> 00:20:41.609
and we've totally
fucked each other up.

390
00:20:41.642 --> 00:20:47.048
I was thinking maybe we start
with bowling or something?

391
00:20:47.081 --> 00:20:48.716
Hey, I'll let you
think about it.

392
00:20:50.084 --> 00:20:51.152
You can finish that, I'm good.

393
00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:55.623
I'm gonna go mop up
back of house or something.

394
00:21:42.003 --> 00:21:44.437
Hello, excuse me, excuse me!

395
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.475
- Did she notice?
- Nah, girl. You're good.

396
00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:50.011
Trish, you are
a fucking angel.

397
00:21:50.044 --> 00:21:52.747
I know.

398
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.714
Hi!

399
00:21:53.748 --> 00:21:55.415
Hi.

400
00:21:55.448 --> 00:21:57.819
Sorry, I get really sucked in
when I'm reading.

401
00:21:57.852 --> 00:21:59.486
You must be Margaret.

402
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.454
- Morgan.
- Morgan, yes... no, sorry.

403
00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:03.858
I know I knew that.

404
00:22:03.891 --> 00:22:07.360
- Fuck!
- That's okay. Close enough.

405
00:22:09.931 --> 00:22:11.065
And you are?

406
00:22:11.098 --> 00:22:13.466
Oh, Myles.

407
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.904
I'm gonna be interning
with you guys... girls, girls.

408
00:22:16.938 --> 00:22:19.941
- Female girls.
- Cool!

409
00:22:19.974 --> 00:22:21.408
What happened to Amy?

410
00:22:21.441 --> 00:22:22.777
They moved her
to the assistant position

411
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:24.946
in Young Adult,
lucky bitch.

412
00:22:24.979 --> 00:22:26.747
Good for her, though!

413
00:22:26.781 --> 00:22:28.983
I-I-I meant, like, uh,

414
00:22:29.016 --> 00:22:32.153
women advancing
and the glass ceiling, and...

415
00:22:32.186 --> 00:22:33.821
Myles.

416
00:22:33.855 --> 00:22:35.056
Shut the fuck up.

417
00:22:35.089 --> 00:22:37.525
Okay.

418
00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:46.167
Olivia?

419
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.669
Alan?

420
00:22:48.703 --> 00:22:50.705
Come on in.

421
00:22:55.109 --> 00:22:58.012
Make yourself comfortable.

422
00:23:21.769 --> 00:23:26.040
So, Alan.

423
00:23:26.073 --> 00:23:28.643
What do you want?

424
00:23:28.676 --> 00:23:31.212
Oh boy, um...

425
00:23:31.245 --> 00:23:34.782
I'm not entirely sure, uh...

426
00:23:34.815 --> 00:23:42.023
I do have some ideas,
but I've...

427
00:23:42.056 --> 00:23:44.859
I've never done this before.

428
00:23:44.892 --> 00:23:46.661
Shy, huh?

429
00:23:46.694 --> 00:23:48.529
I like that.

430
00:23:48.562 --> 00:23:50.965
Don't be nervous.

431
00:23:50.998 --> 00:23:54.035
We'll work through it
together.

432
00:23:54.068 --> 00:23:55.970
Let's start at the beginning.

433
00:23:56.003 --> 00:23:58.906
How do you like it?

434
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.542
Hard or soft?

435
00:24:01.575 --> 00:24:02.910
Hard.

436
00:24:02.944 --> 00:24:04.679
Hard and fast
or hard and slow?

437
00:24:04.712 --> 00:24:06.781
Oh, hard and slow.

438
00:24:06.814 --> 00:24:11.752
- I like hard and slow, too.
- That's... that's great.

439
00:24:11.786 --> 00:24:13.988
Close your eyes for me.

440
00:24:19.226 --> 00:24:23.164
I want you to tell me exactly
what you want to do to me.

441
00:24:23.197 --> 00:24:26.901
Okay?

442
00:24:26.934 --> 00:24:28.836
Okay.

443
00:24:31.939 --> 00:24:35.676
We're on the bed,

444
00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:42.116
and you're stroking my knee.

445
00:24:46.854 --> 00:24:48.622
It tickles.

446
00:24:48.656 --> 00:24:50.157
Do you like it
when I stroke your knee?

447
00:24:50.191 --> 00:24:52.994
I like it
when you stroke my knee.

448
00:24:53.027 --> 00:24:55.663
What else am I doing
that you like?

449
00:24:55.696 --> 00:24:58.866
You unbutton my shirt,

450
00:24:58.899 --> 00:25:04.105
and then you...
you take it off,

451
00:25:04.138 --> 00:25:10.845
and then my pants,
you take those off too.

452
00:25:10.878 --> 00:25:15.883
And then... and then,
you take your clothes off.

453
00:25:15.916 --> 00:25:21.555
So now,
no one's wearing clothes.

454
00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:24.258
And...

455
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:28.763
and then,
you kiss me,

456
00:25:28.796 --> 00:25:37.571
and you kiss the...
the tip of my penis,

457
00:25:37.605 --> 00:25:44.178
and you lick it,
you lick it with your tongue.

458
00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:48.215
And you're sucking on it,

459
00:25:48.249 --> 00:25:50.751
and you're gagging.

460
00:25:50.785 --> 00:25:52.319
You're gagging so loud,

461
00:25:52.353 --> 00:25:56.624
and I slap you in the face
with it.

462
00:25:56.657 --> 00:25:58.759
I dick-slap you
right in the face,

463
00:25:58.793 --> 00:26:01.362
and you say,
"Oh, slap me again, Daddy,

464
00:26:01.395 --> 00:26:04.131
with your big, fat cock!"

465
00:26:04.165 --> 00:26:06.934
And so I do.

466
00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:09.637
And then I grab you
by the back of the hair

467
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.739
and I pull you up

468
00:26:11.772 --> 00:26:16.043
and I press your face
against the wall

469
00:26:16.077 --> 00:26:19.780
and I tell you
what a bad girl you've been.

470
00:26:19.814 --> 00:26:22.850
And you beg me
not to punish you,

471
00:26:22.883 --> 00:26:26.320
but bad girls need
to get punished.

472
00:26:26.353 --> 00:26:28.289
So I spank you,

473
00:26:28.322 --> 00:26:30.925
I spank you so hard,

474
00:26:30.958 --> 00:26:33.327
and you say,
"I'll be a good girl, Daddy,

475
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.262
I promise!"

476
00:26:35.296 --> 00:26:38.399
And I say, "That's what
you said last time.

477
00:26:38.432 --> 00:26:41.102
You need to learn your lesson,

478
00:26:41.135 --> 00:26:43.971
and I'm gonna
fuck it into you."

479
00:26:44.004 --> 00:26:46.273
So that's what I do.

480
00:26:46.307 --> 00:26:47.942
I bend you over

481
00:26:47.975 --> 00:26:50.111
and I'm fucking you
with my big cock,

482
00:26:50.144 --> 00:26:54.281
and your cum
is dripping down my balls,

483
00:26:54.315 --> 00:26:58.252
and you're moaning
and I'm spanking you

484
00:26:58.285 --> 00:27:00.387
and I'm choking you,

485
00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:03.657
hitting your head
against the wall,

486
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:05.693
and then I cum.

487
00:27:05.726 --> 00:27:09.430
I cum so hard,
it shoots all over your face.

488
00:27:09.463 --> 00:27:12.099
And it's in your eyes,

489
00:27:12.133 --> 00:27:14.668
and it's dripping
down your nose,

490
00:27:14.702 --> 00:27:18.239
and it's all over
the filthy bathroom.

491
00:27:18.272 --> 00:27:20.808
And I look at you
and I say,

492
00:27:20.841 --> 00:27:24.145
"Look at the mess you made,
you dirty little bitch.

493
00:27:24.178 --> 00:27:26.981
Clean it up."

494
00:27:31.218 --> 00:27:34.788
So was it as good
as the last time?

495
00:27:34.822 --> 00:27:36.924
Excuse me?

496
00:27:36.957 --> 00:27:38.425
Uh, the food.

497
00:27:38.459 --> 00:27:39.894
Full disclosure:

498
00:27:39.927 --> 00:27:40.961
I'm not trying to be creepy.

499
00:27:40.995 --> 00:27:42.062
I saw you here
the other day

500
00:27:42.096 --> 00:27:43.130
and I was gonna say something,

501
00:27:43.164 --> 00:27:44.899
but then I didn't,

502
00:27:44.932 --> 00:27:47.768
because I kinda find you
incredibly intimidating.

503
00:27:47.801 --> 00:27:49.737
You think I'm intimidating.

504
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.439
- Very much so.
- Wow.

505
00:27:52.473 --> 00:27:54.341
That's some poor judgment.

506
00:27:54.375 --> 00:27:57.111
No, I think you need
to give yourself more credit.

507
00:27:57.144 --> 00:27:58.879
Well, I can't be
that intimidating

508
00:27:58.913 --> 00:28:00.848
with the quick turnaround.

509
00:28:00.881 --> 00:28:02.082
Oh... no, I had a beer.

510
00:28:02.116 --> 00:28:06.020
- Ah. The truth comes out.
- So it does.

511
00:28:11.926 --> 00:28:13.727
I'm Lowick.

512
00:28:13.761 --> 00:28:14.962
Morgan.

513
00:28:14.995 --> 00:28:16.363
Just so you know,

514
00:28:16.397 --> 00:28:19.333
I kinda consider myself
a pho connoisseur.

515
00:28:19.366 --> 00:28:22.870
That is...
that is painfully dorky.

516
00:28:22.903 --> 00:28:23.938
Speaking of,

517
00:28:23.971 --> 00:28:26.740
you are more than welcome
to come sit over here,

518
00:28:26.774 --> 00:28:28.175
if you want.

519
00:28:28.209 --> 00:28:29.476
Because you're eating alone

520
00:28:29.511 --> 00:28:32.279
and you look like
a total loser.

521
00:28:32.313 --> 00:28:34.516
You're eating alone.

522
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:35.916
Well, yeah, but I already have
the whole dork thing

523
00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.117
going on pretty strong,

524
00:28:37.151 --> 00:28:38.919
so loser suits me.

525
00:28:38.953 --> 00:28:40.788
I do like sports, though.

526
00:28:40.821 --> 00:28:42.957
- I don't think that helps.
- Shit.

527
00:28:48.429 --> 00:28:50.164
You know what?

528
00:28:50.197 --> 00:28:52.032
Just forget I said anything.

529
00:28:52.066 --> 00:28:56.036
Or I... you look like
you've had a hard week.

530
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:58.105
So I'm... I'm gonna come
over there with this.

531
00:29:04.211 --> 00:29:05.246
Hi!

532
00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:08.415
Hi.

533
00:29:08.449 --> 00:29:10.784
- You know what's crazy?
- What?

534
00:29:10.818 --> 00:29:12.453
Sitting at a table
with another human being

535
00:29:12.486 --> 00:29:14.822
can make you feel so much better
about your life.

536
00:29:16.857 --> 00:29:18.192
So what happened?

537
00:29:18.225 --> 00:29:20.060
With what?

538
00:29:20.094 --> 00:29:21.395
You know. Your day.

539
00:29:21.428 --> 00:29:22.463
You look like
you had a hard day,

540
00:29:22.496 --> 00:29:24.164
and we've established
it can't possibly be

541
00:29:24.198 --> 00:29:25.933
about the food.

542
00:29:25.966 --> 00:29:27.268
Just work stuff.

543
00:29:27.301 --> 00:29:29.169
Mm. I get that.

544
00:29:29.203 --> 00:29:31.839
Work can be a pain in the ass.

545
00:29:31.872 --> 00:29:34.041
You have no idea.

546
00:29:34.074 --> 00:29:35.242
Why? What do you do?

547
00:29:35.276 --> 00:29:36.210
It's lame.

548
00:29:36.243 --> 00:29:37.878
Oh my God.

549
00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:39.581
- You just lied to me.
- No I didn't.

550
00:29:39.614 --> 00:29:41.248
We just shared
our first lie,

551
00:29:41.282 --> 00:29:42.883
and it came
from your mouth.

552
00:29:42.916 --> 00:29:44.151
- No!
- Here's the thing about lying.

553
00:29:44.184 --> 00:29:45.986
Lying is something
that I do not mess around with,

554
00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.021
me personally.

555
00:29:47.054 --> 00:29:48.355
If this is something
we're gonna continue...

556
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:49.490
"This"?

557
00:29:49.524 --> 00:29:51.091
Yeah, eating
at the same restaurant.

558
00:29:51.125 --> 00:29:52.326
Got it.

559
00:29:52.359 --> 00:29:56.063
Then I'm gonna need you to be
completely honest with me.

560
00:29:56.096 --> 00:29:58.832
I think I can manage that.

561
00:29:58.866 --> 00:30:00.602
So, Morgan.

562
00:30:00.635 --> 00:30:03.337
- Yes.
- What do you do?

563
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.406
I'm an almost-publisher.

564
00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:07.174
- Mm.
- Mm.

565
00:30:07.207 --> 00:30:08.409
So you just loiter
outside of the building

566
00:30:08.442 --> 00:30:09.611
demanding pay?

567
00:30:09.644 --> 00:30:11.546
- Yes.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

568
00:30:11.579 --> 00:30:15.182
I didn't mean to, uh,
underestimate your position.

569
00:30:15.215 --> 00:30:19.486
Okay. What kind of books
do you pretend-publish?

570
00:30:19.521 --> 00:30:21.121
Fantasy.

571
00:30:24.425 --> 00:30:25.359
Say that again.

572
00:30:25.392 --> 00:30:26.460
Fantasy.

573
00:30:26.493 --> 00:30:27.995
- No, I heard you the first time.
- Okay.

574
00:30:28.028 --> 00:30:30.164
You were making fun of me
and calling me a loser.

575
00:30:30.197 --> 00:30:31.932
Fantasy can be really cool.

576
00:30:31.965 --> 00:30:33.901
Yeah, if you're
my nine-year-old nephew

577
00:30:33.934 --> 00:30:35.369
and you're in love
with Twilight.

578
00:30:35.402 --> 00:30:36.538
Your nephew likes Twilight?

579
00:30:36.571 --> 00:30:38.005
He loves Twilight.

580
00:30:38.038 --> 00:30:40.007
He's not very popular
with the ladies.

581
00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.442
Oh. I've got cash.

582
00:30:41.475 --> 00:30:42.510
No, it's fine, I got it.

583
00:30:42.544 --> 00:30:44.345
Put it on the card. Thanks.

584
00:30:44.378 --> 00:30:46.614
You're good, he's gone.

585
00:30:46.648 --> 00:30:48.215
Okay, hm.

586
00:30:48.248 --> 00:30:52.252
What is the best almost-book
you've ever read?

587
00:30:52.286 --> 00:30:55.389
- Really?
- Yeah.

588
00:30:55.422 --> 00:30:57.991
Okay, um...

589
00:30:58.025 --> 00:31:00.427
it's about these two worlds
that exist.

590
00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:02.664
One is well-manicured,
it's for the elite,

591
00:31:02.697 --> 00:31:04.498
and the other one is rural,

592
00:31:04.532 --> 00:31:08.402
- it's incredibly impoverished.
- It's like Elysium.

593
00:31:08.435 --> 00:31:09.504
The Matt Damon movie.

594
00:31:09.537 --> 00:31:11.171
If this is dumb, we really
don't have to do this.

595
00:31:11.205 --> 00:31:13.040
No, keep talking
I'm listening, I'm sorry.

596
00:31:13.073 --> 00:31:14.441
- I'll shut up.
- Yeah? Okay.

597
00:31:14.475 --> 00:31:16.611
So, this child is born
in the second world,

598
00:31:16.644 --> 00:31:19.913
but this mom, she doesn't
want her child to live, like,

599
00:31:19.947 --> 00:31:21.115
through a life of struggles.

600
00:31:21.148 --> 00:31:23.083
So she smuggles the baby
to the first world.

601
00:31:23.117 --> 00:31:24.619
Naturally.

602
00:31:26.554 --> 00:31:27.689
That's it.

603
00:31:27.722 --> 00:31:28.956
That's all you're gonna tell me.

604
00:31:28.989 --> 00:31:30.057
Yes.

605
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.559
You're just gonna leave me
on a cliff like that.

606
00:31:31.593 --> 00:31:33.293
Well, you're engaged, right?

607
00:31:33.327 --> 00:31:35.129
This is like
the end of The Sopranos.

608
00:31:35.162 --> 00:31:36.930
- Well, you're not gonna...
- You just cut to bl...

609
00:31:40.968 --> 00:31:43.237
Seem a little tense, kiddo.

610
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.707
I'm fine.

611
00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.441
Work stuff.

612
00:31:47.474 --> 00:31:48.643
I'm telling you,

613
00:31:48.676 --> 00:31:51.044
you have to check out this forum
that I've been attending.

614
00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:54.047
Don't laugh.

615
00:31:54.081 --> 00:31:57.719
Okay? It's about
choosing your happiness, okay?

616
00:31:57.752 --> 00:31:59.353
Being proactive.

617
00:31:59.386 --> 00:32:01.955
None of this manifesting
or meditation bullshit.

618
00:32:01.989 --> 00:32:03.591
I mean, it's real stuff
that you can use

619
00:32:03.625 --> 00:32:05.727
and make an immediate impact
in your life.

620
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.695
- Immediate?
- Yeah. Well...

621
00:32:07.729 --> 00:32:10.532
it still takes time
and work, you know,

622
00:32:10.565 --> 00:32:12.099
but it's...
it's really incredible.

623
00:32:12.132 --> 00:32:15.235
No, it sounds like
a pyramid scheme.

624
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:16.704
It's not...

625
00:32:16.738 --> 00:32:18.472
- Forget it.
- No, I'm sorry, Dad, I'm sorry,

626
00:32:18.506 --> 00:32:22.176
keep telling me
about your cult.

627
00:32:22.209 --> 00:32:24.311
It's not a cult.

628
00:32:24.344 --> 00:32:25.680
Look, all I'm saying is,

629
00:32:25.713 --> 00:32:27.481
it pushes you to get out there

630
00:32:27.515 --> 00:32:29.717
and make the most
of our time here.

631
00:32:29.751 --> 00:32:31.084
Hm.

632
00:32:31.118 --> 00:32:32.319
Did you know

633
00:32:32.352 --> 00:32:34.689
that the chances of us being
who we are,

634
00:32:34.722 --> 00:32:37.291
alive,
right now at this time,

635
00:32:37.324 --> 00:32:39.426
is one in three trillion?

636
00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.328
- Oh wow.
- Yeah. Isn't that amazing?

637
00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:43.497
- Can I get you anything else?
- Yeah, another mimosa, please.

638
00:32:43.531 --> 00:32:45.265
Definitely.

639
00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:47.434
- And for you, sir?
- Uh, yeah, um...

640
00:32:47.468 --> 00:32:49.571
I'll just take
some more coffee and, uh...

641
00:32:49.604 --> 00:32:51.539
and the check, please.

642
00:32:51.573 --> 00:32:55.042
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

643
00:32:57.144 --> 00:32:59.246
You can talk to me.

644
00:32:59.279 --> 00:33:01.583
I know. I know!

645
00:33:01.616 --> 00:33:03.183
I know I can.

646
00:33:06.654 --> 00:33:09.022
I love you.

647
00:33:09.056 --> 00:33:11.024
I love you too.

648
00:33:11.058 --> 00:33:12.760
Promise me you'll
check into the forum?

649
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:17.097
Hey! Thank you,
I got that.

650
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:20.467
Oof. Um, yeah,
got my, uh, cards right here,

651
00:33:20.501 --> 00:33:24.037
packed them, yeah...

652
00:33:24.071 --> 00:33:25.205
Wait a second.

653
00:33:25.239 --> 00:33:26.774
Coulda sworn
I put them right here.

654
00:33:26.808 --> 00:33:29.209
I woke up this morning,
I put it in my... yes, I know,

655
00:33:29.243 --> 00:33:32.446
they've gotta be here,
I know they're here.

656
00:33:32.479 --> 00:33:34.682
Dammit.

657
00:33:34.716 --> 00:33:36.483
I put it here,
I know I put it here today,

658
00:33:36.518 --> 00:33:37.619
- I put it right here.
- You know, Dad, totally fine.

659
00:33:37.652 --> 00:33:38.786
- I got it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

660
00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:39.621
- Don't even worry about it.
- A father should be able

661
00:33:39.654 --> 00:33:41.488
to take his daughter
out for lunch.

662
00:33:41.523 --> 00:33:42.489
Just give me one second, please.

663
00:33:42.524 --> 00:33:44.091
- Put it on there...
- I'll take that, please,

664
00:33:44.124 --> 00:33:45.492
just do that.

665
00:33:45.527 --> 00:33:47.795
Dad, totally fine,
not a big deal.

666
00:33:47.829 --> 00:33:50.097
Put that right there,
hold on a second, I think...

667
00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:51.699
ahh!

668
00:33:51.733 --> 00:33:52.767
Forgot I put 'em
in my pants.

669
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.501
- Could you do me a favor?
- Oh, he has two cards.

670
00:33:54.536 --> 00:33:55.637
- Thirty on this one.
- Thirty on that.

671
00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.337
And then the rest on...

672
00:33:57.371 --> 00:33:58.372
- Is that the same card?
- You know what?

673
00:33:58.405 --> 00:33:59.339
He'll pay me back.

674
00:33:59.373 --> 00:34:00.608
- Thank you so much.
- Dad, I was a waiter,

675
00:34:00.642 --> 00:34:01.743
that's really difficult,
please.

676
00:34:01.776 --> 00:34:03.110
- No, it's not!
- Okay, fine.

677
00:34:03.143 --> 00:34:05.445
Oh my God, Dad, please!

678
00:34:05.479 --> 00:34:07.114
Here, it's totally fine,
thank you.

679
00:34:07.147 --> 00:34:08.550
You know what? Hey, hey...

680
00:34:10.518 --> 00:34:12.720
It's totally fine.

681
00:34:20.828 --> 00:34:22.129
You didn't have to do that.

682
00:34:22.162 --> 00:34:25.600
Dad, it's fine.

683
00:34:25.633 --> 00:34:27.401
You think I like my daughter
paying for herself

684
00:34:27.434 --> 00:34:29.737
- around me?
- I'm an adult!

685
00:34:29.771 --> 00:34:32.105
It's okay.

686
00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:33.541
Maybe.

687
00:34:33.575 --> 00:34:35.275
But you're still my child.

688
00:34:35.309 --> 00:34:37.210
Okay.

689
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.315
Bottoms up.

690
00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:53.795
Oh my God!

691
00:34:53.828 --> 00:34:55.128
No, that's not true.

692
00:34:55.162 --> 00:34:56.798
No, it's fine, I'm...

693
00:34:59.399 --> 00:35:00.668
No! Somebody's gonna see.

694
00:35:00.702 --> 00:35:02.235
Nobody's gonna see.

695
00:35:02.269 --> 00:35:03.905
- It's gonna be fine.
- Yes, they are!

696
00:35:03.938 --> 00:35:06.206
I'm into it, I'm into it.

697
00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:07.542
My God, no, just come in.

698
00:35:07.575 --> 00:35:08.876
It's a quiet hallway.

699
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:10.545
Do you wanna...
do you wanna come in?

700
00:35:10.578 --> 00:35:14.214
Yeah, let's...
let's go inside.

701
00:35:15.382 --> 00:35:17.351
Give me a break.

702
00:35:17.384 --> 00:35:18.586
Come on. Go ahead.

703
00:35:59.359 --> 00:36:00.895
Casey.

704
00:36:00.928 --> 00:36:02.195
It's good to see you.

705
00:36:02.229 --> 00:36:03.363
I thought you were
out of town, Max.

706
00:36:03.397 --> 00:36:04.732
I was.

707
00:36:04.766 --> 00:36:07.367
But I'm back now.

708
00:36:07.401 --> 00:36:08.736
But don't worry,
these walls are...

709
00:36:09.804 --> 00:36:11.673
...pretty thick.

710
00:36:11.706 --> 00:36:13.641
Is Nathan home?

711
00:36:13.675 --> 00:36:15.375
Maybe.

712
00:36:15.409 --> 00:36:17.912
I think he was, uh,
texting some girl.

713
00:36:22.282 --> 00:36:23.483
Hey, sexy.

714
00:36:23.518 --> 00:36:25.452
Hey.

715
00:36:25.485 --> 00:36:27.387
Hey, sexy.

716
00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:29.489
Um, right back at you.

717
00:36:29.524 --> 00:36:30.658
Thank you.

718
00:36:30.692 --> 00:36:32.292
This is a very,

719
00:36:32.325 --> 00:36:34.394
very, very, very,
very pleasant surprise.

720
00:36:34.428 --> 00:36:35.930
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

721
00:36:35.963 --> 00:36:38.900
Well, lucky for you
I have another surprise for you.

722
00:36:38.933 --> 00:36:40.233
Gimme your hand.

723
00:36:44.038 --> 00:36:46.406
- No underwear.
- Mm-hm.

724
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.341
- Smooth.
- Yeah.

725
00:36:53.948 --> 00:36:56.316
Oh, you're smooth too.

726
00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:58.586
We really gotta work
on our sex talk.

727
00:36:58.619 --> 00:37:01.589
Yeah, we do.

728
00:37:04.892 --> 00:37:07.028
Ow, ow, ow, my ear.

729
00:37:09.496 --> 00:37:10.497
Sorry, sorry.

730
00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:12.834
Good try, yeah.

731
00:37:24.579 --> 00:37:26.848
And one more thing,
just to conclude.

732
00:37:26.881 --> 00:37:29.316
The employee
with the most upsells...

733
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:31.018
remember, upsells...

734
00:37:31.052 --> 00:37:32.854
at the end of each month
will get a prize.

735
00:37:32.887 --> 00:37:35.288
This month,
the prize will be...

736
00:37:35.322 --> 00:37:37.558
drumroll, please.

737
00:37:45.032 --> 00:37:47.400
Yeah, thanks, Jeff.

738
00:37:47.434 --> 00:37:50.972
The winner will get
20 Dave & Buster's dollars!

739
00:37:51.005 --> 00:37:54.374
What? Yes!

740
00:37:54.407 --> 00:37:56.043
- I have a question.
- What?

741
00:37:56.077 --> 00:37:58.311
Is that exchangeable?

742
00:37:58.345 --> 00:37:59.446
Exchangeable for what?

743
00:37:59.479 --> 00:38:00.948
- Well, real money.
- For cash.

744
00:38:00.982 --> 00:38:02.482
I don't go to Dave & Buster's.

745
00:38:02.517 --> 00:38:05.586
No, shut up.
Anyone else?

746
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.622
- When's this meeting over?
- Pardon?

747
00:38:07.655 --> 00:38:09.023
Never mind.

748
00:38:09.056 --> 00:38:11.726
Do you even work here?

749
00:38:11.759 --> 00:38:13.795
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
we open at 5 a.m.

750
00:38:13.828 --> 00:38:15.696
You have to stop doing this.

751
00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:17.098
It's not funny, Sage.

752
00:38:17.131 --> 00:38:18.465
Sorry.

753
00:38:18.498 --> 00:38:19.834
It's not funny.

754
00:38:19.867 --> 00:38:21.434
Can we lock the doors next time?

755
00:38:21.468 --> 00:38:23.971
- All right.
- Yeah, thanks.

756
00:38:39.419 --> 00:38:41.656
Oh, loser!

757
00:38:41.689 --> 00:38:43.925
Okay, I was going easy on you,

758
00:38:43.958 --> 00:38:45.492
but I'm done doing it.

759
00:38:50.698 --> 00:38:52.066
You scored on yourself!

760
00:38:52.099 --> 00:38:53.366
All right,
you see this?

761
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.769
- Yeah.
- So let's talk about...

762
00:38:54.802 --> 00:38:57.004
- Talk about what?
- ...the next...

763
00:38:58.639 --> 00:39:00.107
Ooh. This is a fast game.

764
00:39:07.181 --> 00:39:08.149
Come on, then.

765
00:39:10.685 --> 00:39:14.454
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

766
00:39:14.487 --> 00:39:15.857
Man, I can't wait
to see the face you make

767
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:17.124
when you lose.

768
00:39:17.158 --> 00:39:18.793
Yeah, that's...
yeah, that's rich.

769
00:39:18.826 --> 00:39:20.995
You're a goddamned
fucking comedian.

770
00:39:21.028 --> 00:39:22.597
Thank you.

771
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.065
No, no... wait, wait!

772
00:39:24.098 --> 00:39:25.600
Stakes.

773
00:39:25.633 --> 00:39:28.468
Ooh. Forgot about stakes.

774
00:39:28.501 --> 00:39:29.737
Name your price.

775
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:33.074
I win,
you get a Sailor Moon tattoo

776
00:39:33.107 --> 00:39:34.275
on your ass.

777
00:39:34.308 --> 00:39:38.779
Mm. Yeah, no, I was thinking
more in the realm of, like,

778
00:39:38.813 --> 00:39:39.981
mm, I buy you dinner.

779
00:39:40.014 --> 00:39:41.481
You already bought me dinner.

780
00:39:41.515 --> 00:39:43.918
Okay. Use it as
a frame of reference.

781
00:39:43.951 --> 00:39:46.754
Um...

782
00:39:46.787 --> 00:39:48.789
Oh, oh, oh, ha!

783
00:39:48.823 --> 00:39:50.124
I win,

784
00:39:50.157 --> 00:39:53.194
you shave off
both your eyebrows.

785
00:39:53.227 --> 00:39:54.996
No. But closer.

786
00:39:55.029 --> 00:39:56.130
Pussy?

787
00:39:56.163 --> 00:39:58.566
Sure. Yeah, you win,
I get your pussy.

788
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:07.174
It was a joke, I don't want
any of your pussy.

789
00:40:07.208 --> 00:40:09.777
I am so sorry,
that was such a bad joke.

790
00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.079
Ooh! I win,

791
00:40:12.113 --> 00:40:14.115
you paint your nails hot pink.

792
00:40:14.148 --> 00:40:16.083
I'm not really sure
how you made that leap,

793
00:40:16.117 --> 00:40:17.118
but done!

794
00:40:17.151 --> 00:40:18.586
- Toenails included.
- Fine.

795
00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:20.621
But, if I win...

796
00:40:20.655 --> 00:40:22.523
Unlikely.

797
00:40:22.556 --> 00:40:23.758
...you have to tell me
something about yourself

798
00:40:23.791 --> 00:40:26.459
that most people don't know.

799
00:40:26.493 --> 00:40:27.662
You're a closed book.

800
00:40:27.695 --> 00:40:29.630
Gotta get the story out
somehow.

801
00:40:29.664 --> 00:40:31.132
Although I don't know
why you'd be worried

802
00:40:31.165 --> 00:40:32.633
unless you think maybe
there's some chance

803
00:40:32.667 --> 00:40:35.002
you might lose?

804
00:40:35.036 --> 00:40:36.904
Funny,
you fucking bastard.

805
00:40:36.938 --> 00:40:37.872
You ready?

806
00:40:37.905 --> 00:40:38.773
Oh, I'm ready.

807
00:40:38.806 --> 00:40:41.709
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

808
00:40:43.644 --> 00:40:45.513
Almost.

809
00:40:45.546 --> 00:40:46.514
- Oh!
- Oh my God,

810
00:40:46.547 --> 00:40:47.648
you're so angry.

811
00:40:50.084 --> 00:40:51.052
Oh, God.

812
00:40:53.587 --> 00:40:56.757
- Yes!
- Nooo! No, no, no, no!

813
00:40:56.791 --> 00:41:00.194
- I told you I'd win.
- No! Oh, I can't breathe.

814
00:41:00.227 --> 00:41:01.095
Oh, that is rich.

815
00:41:01.128 --> 00:41:02.563
- Hold still.
- No, no.

816
00:41:02.596 --> 00:41:04.098
Okay, good. Hold still,
hold still, hold still.

817
00:41:04.131 --> 00:41:05.933
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

818
00:41:05.967 --> 00:41:07.735
- No, no!
- That's good, that's perfect.

819
00:41:07.768 --> 00:41:09.570
Oh, look, look!

820
00:41:09.603 --> 00:41:11.939
- Oh, the face of defeat...
- Help me!

821
00:41:11.973 --> 00:41:13.040
...is rich!

822
00:41:16.644 --> 00:41:19.513
It is like that homeless man
bent over and released

823
00:41:19.547 --> 00:41:22.283
an inhuman amount
of explosive diarrhea,

824
00:41:22.316 --> 00:41:24.719
and then decided to just do,
like,

825
00:41:24.752 --> 00:41:27.221
a 360 while he was at it.

826
00:41:27.254 --> 00:41:29.757
Wow. Is that what you say
to all the ladies?

827
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:30.992
Just you.

828
00:41:31.025 --> 00:41:32.026
Touched.

829
00:41:32.059 --> 00:41:34.195
Hey, do you think
the ceiling fan in the back

830
00:41:34.228 --> 00:41:35.997
is high enough for me
to hang a noose from?

831
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.065
Come on,
don't sound so bleak.

832
00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:40.768
You've got those Dave & Buster's
bucks to look forward to,

833
00:41:40.801 --> 00:41:41.969
you can't forget that,

834
00:41:42.003 --> 00:41:43.571
it's important information.

835
00:41:43.604 --> 00:41:44.605
All right, I'm just
gonna come out and say it,

836
00:41:44.638 --> 00:41:46.140
'cause I know everyone else
is thinking it.

837
00:41:46.173 --> 00:41:47.908
You're gay?

838
00:41:47.942 --> 00:41:48.976
I wish.

839
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.611
My romantic life would be
a lot less depressing

840
00:41:50.644 --> 00:41:51.779
if that was the case.

841
00:41:51.812 --> 00:41:53.848
Well, word on the street is
you've given a blow job,

842
00:41:53.881 --> 00:41:55.816
so I'm sure if you enjoyed that,

843
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:58.219
you will be
pleasantly surprised by it.

844
00:41:58.252 --> 00:41:59.687
Okay, first of all,

845
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.655
I was on the receiving end
of that blow job,

846
00:42:01.689 --> 00:42:03.290
and that was
a onetime experiment,

847
00:42:03.324 --> 00:42:04.892
it doesn't make me gay.

848
00:42:04.925 --> 00:42:06.327
It's not...

849
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.828
It definitely brings
your level of straight

850
00:42:07.862 --> 00:42:08.729
into question.

851
00:42:08.763 --> 00:42:09.663
Like you're so pure,

852
00:42:09.697 --> 00:42:12.833
Miss "It's easier
to go down on a girl

853
00:42:12.867 --> 00:42:15.036
than it is to suck a dick."

854
00:42:16.237 --> 00:42:18.806
Yeah. It is.
It absolutely is.

855
00:42:18.839 --> 00:42:20.574
And that was
a threesome situation,

856
00:42:20.608 --> 00:42:23.110
not one-on-one,
so totally different scenario.

857
00:42:23.144 --> 00:42:24.211
You know what?

858
00:42:24.245 --> 00:42:26.247
Those certificates are going
straight to Grace Kim,

859
00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.214
by the way.

860
00:42:27.248 --> 00:42:29.316
Who, by pure chance
being of Asian descent

861
00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:33.187
has the natural ability
to just beat all of us,

862
00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:34.088
because she's Asian.

863
00:42:34.121 --> 00:42:35.890
Yeah, I don't think
the ceiling fan

864
00:42:35.923 --> 00:42:38.059
will sustain your weight,
but...

865
00:42:38.092 --> 00:42:40.194
you could try the exposed pipe
in the walk-in freezer.

866
00:42:40.227 --> 00:42:41.796
Just a thought.

867
00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:44.365
I love my life.

868
00:42:44.398 --> 00:42:46.634
Well, it could be worse.

869
00:42:46.667 --> 00:42:48.302
You could be Laurel.

870
00:42:48.335 --> 00:42:50.004
I never thought about that.

871
00:42:50.037 --> 00:42:52.006
- That's really dark.
- That's super dark.

872
00:42:52.039 --> 00:42:53.741
That's also funny!

873
00:42:53.774 --> 00:42:56.177
I'm telling you, you got
this dark humor thing down.

874
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.645
You should really
capitalize on it,

875
00:42:57.678 --> 00:42:58.913
do some stand-up.

876
00:42:58.946 --> 00:43:01.082
In fact, there's this
really cool open mic

877
00:43:01.115 --> 00:43:02.950
- Thursday...
- No!

878
00:43:02.983 --> 00:43:03.784
What can I do?

879
00:43:03.818 --> 00:43:05.252
What can I do
to change your mind?

880
00:43:06.854 --> 00:43:09.023
Not suck dick, yeah.

881
00:43:09.056 --> 00:43:11.225
I told you,
I was on the receiving end.

882
00:43:11.258 --> 00:43:14.061
Oh my God, I forgot, yeah, and
also not get your dick sucked

883
00:43:14.095 --> 00:43:15.162
by other dudes.

884
00:43:15.196 --> 00:43:17.398
See? Now you're just
setting me up for failure.

885
00:43:17.431 --> 00:43:18.567
Why do you do that?

886
00:43:18.599 --> 00:43:20.835
Oh no, you are doing that
all on your own, I promise.

887
00:43:20.868 --> 00:43:23.804
So if I hadn't let Martin
have his way with me,

888
00:43:23.838 --> 00:43:25.072
then you'd let me date you?

889
00:43:25.106 --> 00:43:26.640
Honestly?

890
00:43:26.674 --> 00:43:28.275
I don't even care
that you like dudes, whatever.

891
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:32.279
It's your... general existence
that repels me,

892
00:43:32.313 --> 00:43:33.948
it's just like, ugh.

893
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:36.183
Wow. Okay, you know what?

894
00:43:36.217 --> 00:43:37.418
I don't even like you anymore.

895
00:43:37.451 --> 00:43:38.986
All right? There. I said it.

896
00:43:39.019 --> 00:43:40.187
I've been over you for a while.

897
00:43:40.221 --> 00:43:41.288
And you know what?

898
00:43:41.322 --> 00:43:44.225
Martin loves me
for who I am,

899
00:43:44.258 --> 00:43:47.728
so fuck you.

900
00:43:47.761 --> 00:43:49.063
Where are you going?

901
00:43:49.096 --> 00:43:52.867
I'm going to hang myself
from the freezer.

902
00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.968
Unless you'd miss me.

903
00:43:54.001 --> 00:43:56.170
Oh no, you go ahead,
you have fun.

904
00:43:56.203 --> 00:43:58.105
Bye!

905
00:43:58.939 --> 00:44:01.342
Okay.

906
00:44:01.375 --> 00:44:05.012
Have I got something
special for you.

907
00:44:07.248 --> 00:44:09.016
So what is it?

908
00:44:09.049 --> 00:44:11.752
Some red wine.

909
00:44:11.785 --> 00:44:13.420
- Tell me. Tell me.
- It's a good cab,

910
00:44:13.454 --> 00:44:16.056
cab sauvignon, somethin'.

911
00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.025
It's Trader Joe's house wine.

912
00:44:18.058 --> 00:44:19.693
That's, like, six bucks.

913
00:44:19.727 --> 00:44:21.996
Four. Got it on clearance.

914
00:44:22.029 --> 00:44:23.097
Well, then,
I hope it has mold

915
00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:25.399
and you go into
anaphylactic shock.

916
00:44:25.432 --> 00:44:28.836
That could very potentially lead
to both of our deaths.

917
00:44:28.869 --> 00:44:30.771
I welcome death.

918
00:44:30.804 --> 00:44:33.307
Hm. Cheers.

919
00:44:34.408 --> 00:44:35.309
To our mass suicide.

920
00:44:35.342 --> 00:44:36.911
Okay.

921
00:44:40.515 --> 00:44:42.483
Oh, it's terrible!

922
00:44:42.517 --> 00:44:45.119
I am so sorry.

923
00:44:45.152 --> 00:44:46.253
That's all right.

924
00:44:46.287 --> 00:44:47.755
I don't think so,
I think it's the worst thing

925
00:44:47.788 --> 00:44:50.090
that's ever been
inside my mouth.

926
00:44:50.124 --> 00:44:52.826
There's been some weird shit
in my mouth.

927
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.261
But that is bad.

928
00:44:54.295 --> 00:44:56.797
Uggh!

929
00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:58.399
Okay.

930
00:44:58.432 --> 00:44:59.833
You ready?

931
00:44:59.867 --> 00:45:01.735
For what?

932
00:45:04.972 --> 00:45:05.906
What?

933
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:06.974
- Talk.
- No.

934
00:45:07.007 --> 00:45:08.042
- Yeah.
- No, we really don't

935
00:45:08.075 --> 00:45:08.976
have to do this.

936
00:45:09.009 --> 00:45:09.877
Oh, we really do,
because if I had lost,

937
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:11.779
you'da made me
paint my fingernails,

938
00:45:11.812 --> 00:45:13.814
so you're...
you're gonna talk.

939
00:45:13.847 --> 00:45:14.715
But whatever
I'm gonna come up with

940
00:45:14.748 --> 00:45:17.351
is gonna be lame
and depressing so, no.

941
00:45:17.384 --> 00:45:18.485
I love lame and depressing,

942
00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.954
that's why I asked you out.

943
00:45:19.987 --> 00:45:21.355
Fuck you.

944
00:45:21.388 --> 00:45:23.757
Fine. Okay.

945
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:28.762
I haven't talked
with my parents in 10 years.

946
00:45:31.265 --> 00:45:33.901
- Okay.
- That's it.

947
00:45:33.934 --> 00:45:36.337
You have any cheese
that can go with this?

948
00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:37.539
You're not gonna
get away with that.

949
00:45:37.572 --> 00:45:39.340
If I drink
on an empty stomach,

950
00:45:39.373 --> 00:45:41.475
things tend to get
a little slutty.

951
00:45:41.509 --> 00:45:42.376
And I like you,

952
00:45:42.409 --> 00:45:46.347
so I wanna just
stay a little classy.

953
00:45:48.449 --> 00:45:50.851
You said you like me!

954
00:45:50.884 --> 00:45:52.486
Oh.

955
00:45:54.221 --> 00:45:55.923
- Did you like that?
- Don't ever do that ever again.

956
00:45:55.956 --> 00:45:57.391
- No?
- Could you maybe, like,

957
00:45:57.424 --> 00:45:58.993
talk a little low, maybe that?

958
00:45:59.026 --> 00:46:01.095
- Like Vin Diesel?
- Yes.

959
00:46:01.128 --> 00:46:02.429
Family.

960
00:46:03.464 --> 00:46:06.200
I can't really
lower my voice that much, but...

961
00:46:06.233 --> 00:46:08.869
- family.
- Oh!

962
00:46:08.902 --> 00:46:10.471
- Fantastic.
- Fine!

963
00:46:10.505 --> 00:46:11.905
- What?
- If I get you cheese,

964
00:46:11.939 --> 00:46:13.340
will you please finish?

965
00:46:13.374 --> 00:46:15.442
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
get the cheese!

966
00:46:15.476 --> 00:46:16.977
Yes!

967
00:46:23.284 --> 00:46:25.853
Uggh!

968
00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:32.059
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

969
00:46:32.092 --> 00:46:35.429
Okay. Cheese, knife, crackers.

970
00:46:35.462 --> 00:46:38.065
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious.

971
00:46:38.098 --> 00:46:39.800
Blue cheese?

972
00:46:41.368 --> 00:46:43.270
What else do you want from me?

973
00:46:43.304 --> 00:46:48.008
Who hurt you as a child
that you put out blue cheese?

974
00:46:54.081 --> 00:46:56.584
- I like you.
- Aww!

975
00:46:56.618 --> 00:46:57.985
A little bit.

976
00:47:00.655 --> 00:47:02.557
No matter what you tell me,

977
00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:05.359
that's not gonna change.

978
00:47:05.392 --> 00:47:07.194
I promise.

979
00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.975
Okay.

980
00:47:25.112 --> 00:47:28.248
Um...

981
00:47:28.282 --> 00:47:30.652
My dad,

982
00:47:30.685 --> 00:47:32.152
he used to drink.

983
00:47:32.186 --> 00:47:33.555
And one night,

984
00:47:33.588 --> 00:47:35.623
we were watching TV
in the living room,

985
00:47:35.657 --> 00:47:41.028
my mom had fallen asleep putting
my little brother to bed.

986
00:47:41.061 --> 00:47:43.130
My head was in my dad's lap.

987
00:47:43.163 --> 00:47:45.499
He was stroking my hair.

988
00:47:45.533 --> 00:47:50.605
And, um, then I felt
this hand go up my shirt.

989
00:47:52.439 --> 00:47:56.243
First, I didn't know
what to do,

990
00:47:56.276 --> 00:47:59.012
but eventually,
I snapped up,

991
00:47:59.046 --> 00:48:00.682
walked back to my room,

992
00:48:00.715 --> 00:48:06.120
and I slept with the desk chair
pushed against the doorknob.

993
00:48:08.222 --> 00:48:09.189
And the next day,

994
00:48:09.223 --> 00:48:13.127
he pretended like
nothing had ever happened.

995
00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.429
So at first I thought
maybe he didn't remember

996
00:48:15.462 --> 00:48:20.702
or maybe I was
remembering it wrong, but...

997
00:48:20.735 --> 00:48:24.471
every time we would be alone
in a room together,

998
00:48:24.506 --> 00:48:27.374
he would look at me
like he remembered.

999
00:48:27.408 --> 00:48:31.111
Sure enough, another night,
I woke up, and...

1000
00:48:37.652 --> 00:48:40.487
Well, anyways,

1001
00:48:40.522 --> 00:48:44.458
I ended up telling my mom
couple months later.

1002
00:48:44.491 --> 00:48:47.428
She freaked out,

1003
00:48:47.461 --> 00:48:48.696
and my dad said
that he was hurt

1004
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:49.930
that I would say
something like that,

1005
00:48:49.963 --> 00:48:53.267
that he would never hurt me
in a million years, that I...

1006
00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.604
that I was his little girl.

1007
00:49:00.107 --> 00:49:03.143
But my mom threw me
out of the house,

1008
00:49:03.177 --> 00:49:08.282
and I haven't seen either them
or my little brother since.

1009
00:49:14.221 --> 00:49:17.424
I'm so sorry.

1010
00:49:17.458 --> 00:49:20.562
It happens.

1011
00:49:20.595 --> 00:49:24.666
And now, end Chapter One,
right?

1012
00:49:24.699 --> 00:49:26.768
I really hope that I didn't
make you talk about something

1013
00:49:26.801 --> 00:49:28.736
that you didn't want
to talk about, I...

1014
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:32.172
I kinda feel like
a total asshole right now.

1015
00:49:32.206 --> 00:49:34.642
That's because
you are an asshole.

1016
00:49:38.145 --> 00:49:42.382
I hope I didn't
scare you off too much.

1017
00:49:42.416 --> 00:49:43.618
No, no...

1018
00:49:43.651 --> 00:49:45.118
No, I'm just kidding.

1019
00:49:46.721 --> 00:49:49.423
Not at all.

1020
00:49:52.292 --> 00:49:54.696
What? No. Ugh!

1021
00:49:54.729 --> 00:49:56.363
Okay, fine.

1022
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:23.858
I can make you something.

1023
00:50:23.892 --> 00:50:25.660
- You want eggs?
- No, I don't have time for that,

1024
00:50:25.693 --> 00:50:26.694
I'm already late.

1025
00:50:26.728 --> 00:50:27.629
I can make it real quick!

1026
00:50:27.662 --> 00:50:28.596
No!

1027
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:30.798
- They're eggs!
- No!

1028
00:50:30.832 --> 00:50:32.099
All right, well, just
grab something from the kitchen

1029
00:50:32.132 --> 00:50:33.100
before you go.

1030
00:50:33.133 --> 00:50:34.501
- I already did.
- Oh! Sneaky little shithead.

1031
00:50:34.536 --> 00:50:36.704
- I know.
- Mm.

1032
00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:39.641
Gonna miss you.

1033
00:50:39.674 --> 00:50:41.308
Gonna miss you too.

1034
00:50:41.341 --> 00:50:43.176
- Bye.
- Bye.

1035
00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:44.378
Mm, so minty fresh!

1036
00:50:44.411 --> 00:50:46.280
You're minty fresh.

1037
00:50:46.313 --> 00:50:48.148
Where you going?

1038
00:50:48.181 --> 00:50:49.651
Dude.

1039
00:50:49.684 --> 00:50:52.820
Are you even reading
or just staring?

1040
00:50:52.854 --> 00:50:55.122
- I'm staring.
- I know.

1041
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:58.292
Did she notice?

1042
00:50:58.325 --> 00:50:59.226
- Yeah.
- Yep.

1043
00:50:59.259 --> 00:51:00.528
Shit.

1044
00:51:00.562 --> 00:51:03.430
Okay, um...
was she pissed?

1045
00:51:03.463 --> 00:51:04.599
I mean, it's hard to tell.

1046
00:51:04.632 --> 00:51:05.833
She asked where you were.

1047
00:51:05.867 --> 00:51:09.236
Fuck!

1048
00:51:09.269 --> 00:51:10.605
Leeds?

1049
00:51:11.606 --> 00:51:14.274
My office.

1050
00:51:16.744 --> 00:51:18.780
She's... she's in a good mood.

1051
00:51:18.813 --> 00:51:20.648
- Hmph.
- No she's not.

1052
00:51:20.682 --> 00:51:22.249
Shut up!

1053
00:51:28.188 --> 00:51:30.592
Do you enjoy
working for this company?

1054
00:51:30.625 --> 00:51:32.292
Absolutely, ma'am.

1055
00:51:32.326 --> 00:51:35.462
We want a team of people
who take a serious interest

1056
00:51:35.495 --> 00:51:38.566
in building a future
at this company.

1057
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.734
Okay.

1058
00:51:39.767 --> 00:51:41.134
We have an opening
in Adult Fiction.

1059
00:51:41.168 --> 00:51:42.402
It's not a huge
starting salary,

1060
00:51:42.436 --> 00:51:44.539
but a definite pay jump
from zero,

1061
00:51:44.572 --> 00:51:48.475
plus benefits
and room to advance.

1062
00:51:48.509 --> 00:51:51.713
We can draft up a contract
starting Monday.

1063
00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.650
I can take that as a yes?

1064
00:51:55.683 --> 00:51:57.484
I'm so proud of you,

1065
00:51:57.518 --> 00:52:00.788
you beautiful,
beautiful creature!

1066
00:52:00.822 --> 00:52:02.757
Oh, here we go, okay.

1067
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:04.157
Hey, you ready,
or should I give you a moment?

1068
00:52:04.191 --> 00:52:05.325
Another round of Bellinis,
please,

1069
00:52:05.359 --> 00:52:06.828
and make them real strong.

1070
00:52:06.861 --> 00:52:08.495
Or something
less embarrassing.

1071
00:52:08.529 --> 00:52:09.530
We're celebrating,

1072
00:52:09.564 --> 00:52:11.331
so we need it to be fancy!

1073
00:52:11.365 --> 00:52:14.636
And add in some mortification
to balance out the good news.

1074
00:52:14.669 --> 00:52:16.537
With Bellinis.

1075
00:52:16.571 --> 00:52:19.439
- Apparently.
- She just got a promotion.

1076
00:52:19.473 --> 00:52:22.442
- Congratulations!
- Thank you...

1077
00:52:22.476 --> 00:52:23.678
Adrian.

1078
00:52:23.711 --> 00:52:24.712
...Adrian.

1079
00:52:24.746 --> 00:52:26.346
Can I also get
a shot of tequila,

1080
00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:27.414
something redemptive?

1081
00:52:27.447 --> 00:52:29.717
Can you make that
two shots of tequila, please?

1082
00:52:29.751 --> 00:52:30.885
Sure.

1083
00:52:32.285 --> 00:52:33.253
Really?

1084
00:52:33.286 --> 00:52:34.689
I'm out just having fun.

1085
00:52:34.722 --> 00:52:35.823
Really?

1086
00:52:35.857 --> 00:52:38.225
You know what, I'll get in
on that shot, please.

1087
00:52:38.258 --> 00:52:39.661
Yes!

1088
00:52:39.694 --> 00:52:42.496
I'm warding off depression,
it's a serious thing.

1089
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:44.766
All right, tequila preference?

1090
00:52:44.799 --> 00:52:45.700
Well.

1091
00:52:45.733 --> 00:52:48.703
Wow, must've been
some kind of promotion.

1092
00:52:48.736 --> 00:52:52.239
Unpaid to paid,
so in some respects, yes.

1093
00:52:52.272 --> 00:52:56.944
I haven't quite made the jump
from well brand.

1094
00:52:56.978 --> 00:53:00.748
Casamigos, on me.

1095
00:53:00.782 --> 00:53:01.749
Thank you.

1096
00:53:03.918 --> 00:53:06.688
- Casamigos is the best.
- Yes.

1097
00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:07.922
Enjoy.

1098
00:53:09.791 --> 00:53:10.925
Oh, very nice.

1099
00:53:10.958 --> 00:53:12.860
Is your vagina
always this magnetic?

1100
00:53:12.894 --> 00:53:16.229
Dude, he is really hot,
just saying.

1101
00:53:22.603 --> 00:53:26.507
Oh, God, I admire someone
who can chug a Bellini.

1102
00:53:26.541 --> 00:53:27.775
Seriously, I'm just having...

1103
00:53:27.809 --> 00:53:28.910
Having fun, we heard.

1104
00:53:28.943 --> 00:53:31.012
I personally am a fan
of drunk Casey.

1105
00:53:31.045 --> 00:53:32.013
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1106
00:53:32.046 --> 00:53:34.414
Oh, good, then you can be
the one she gropes

1107
00:53:34.448 --> 00:53:35.516
when she passes her limit.

1108
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:37.719
Okay, that was one time.

1109
00:53:37.752 --> 00:53:40.855
- It was more than once.
- It was more than once.

1110
00:53:40.888 --> 00:53:43.024
I'm just having fun tonight.

1111
00:53:43.057 --> 00:53:45.560
Oh, you said that.

1112
00:53:45.593 --> 00:53:47.829
Let's go have some fun!

1113
00:53:54.367 --> 00:53:55.737
Hyperbole.

1114
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.408
Why is that so funny?

1115
00:54:01.441 --> 00:54:02.744
I have no idea.

1116
00:54:02.777 --> 00:54:04.277
I'm getting dropped off.

1117
00:54:04.311 --> 00:54:05.479
No!

1118
00:54:05.513 --> 00:54:07.782
No, you cannot leave.

1119
00:54:07.815 --> 00:54:08.850
We are a tribe.

1120
00:54:08.883 --> 00:54:10.450
Yeah, Sage, we're a tribe.

1121
00:54:10.484 --> 00:54:12.419
Uh-huh, lesbian tribe.

1122
00:54:12.452 --> 00:54:13.320
Okay.

1123
00:54:13.353 --> 00:54:16.389
You can't leave,
that is child abuse.

1124
00:54:16.423 --> 00:54:20.528
Sir, tell her she cannot leave
because that is child abuse.

1125
00:54:24.431 --> 00:54:27.034
Okay, I think only dolphins
could hear that.

1126
00:54:29.871 --> 00:54:31.639
Look at these breasts!

1127
00:54:31.672 --> 00:54:35.375
They're so perfect and shiny

1128
00:54:35.408 --> 00:54:38.045
and soft.

1129
00:54:38.079 --> 00:54:40.548
You could have one to two
nipples in your mouth

1130
00:54:40.581 --> 00:54:44.351
at any given moment,
and, oh, it would just be...

1131
00:54:44.384 --> 00:54:45.653
heaven, wouldn't it?

1132
00:54:45.686 --> 00:54:47.522
Okay, you don't need
to answer that.

1133
00:54:47.555 --> 00:54:48.956
- Thank you.
- He's gonna answer.

1134
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:50.057
Let the man be heard.

1135
00:54:50.091 --> 00:54:52.026
Would it be heaven or would...

1136
00:54:52.059 --> 00:54:54.562
Sir, I have a question for you.

1137
00:54:54.595 --> 00:54:57.098
Yeah?

1138
00:54:57.131 --> 00:55:00.001
What kind of jizz do you have?
Does it taste like rubber?

1139
00:55:00.034 --> 00:55:02.069
- Okay!
- What?

1140
00:55:02.103 --> 00:55:05.540
It's human nature.
Stop being embarrassing.

1141
00:55:05.573 --> 00:55:06.406
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1142
00:55:06.439 --> 00:55:08.609
You know what else is natural?
Yeah?

1143
00:55:08.643 --> 00:55:11.112
Melatonin and hot tea, okay?

1144
00:55:11.145 --> 00:55:13.047
Let's get you some of that.

1145
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.949
- Yeah?
- I think I'm gonna puke.

1146
00:55:14.982 --> 00:55:17.852
No, no, there's no puking
in the car, okay?

1147
00:55:17.885 --> 00:55:19.086
Can you hear that, Casey?

1148
00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:22.123
If you puke,
you have to swallow it.

1149
00:55:22.156 --> 00:55:23.791
You gotta swallow it, okay?

1150
00:55:23.825 --> 00:55:26.828
- Okay.
- It's okay, baby, it's okay.

1151
00:55:26.861 --> 00:55:28.663
We'll get you home.

1152
00:55:28.696 --> 00:55:30.463
We'll catch it right in here.

1153
00:55:31.833 --> 00:55:33.000
Let's go somewhere else.

1154
00:55:33.034 --> 00:55:34.635
No, go back to sleep.

1155
00:55:34.669 --> 00:55:36.137
Go back to sleep, please.

1156
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:38.105
Please put her back to sleep.

1157
00:55:38.139 --> 00:55:41.108
My nipple 'bout to pop out.

1158
00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:01.128
Hello?

1159
00:56:01.162 --> 00:56:02.930
What are you wearing?

1160
00:56:02.964 --> 00:56:04.397
You just get home?

1161
00:56:04.431 --> 00:56:05.733
Mm-hmm.

1162
00:56:05.766 --> 00:56:07.500
- You have fun?
- Mm-hmm.

1163
00:56:07.535 --> 00:56:08.603
Did you have fun?

1164
00:56:08.636 --> 00:56:12.106
Mmm, went to bed at 10 p.m.,
so, yeah, had a blast.

1165
00:56:12.139 --> 00:56:13.774
Well, you should come over
to my bed

1166
00:56:13.808 --> 00:56:16.010
and blast something in my face.

1167
00:56:16.043 --> 00:56:17.745
Look, as much fun
as that sounds,

1168
00:56:17.778 --> 00:56:18.913
I can't tonight.

1169
00:56:18.946 --> 00:56:20.615
What, why?

1170
00:56:20.648 --> 00:56:21.849
Because it's 3 a.m.

1171
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:24.652
So?

1172
00:56:24.685 --> 00:56:27.420
So, I have to wake up early.

1173
00:56:28.656 --> 00:56:30.057
Please?

1174
00:56:30.091 --> 00:56:32.994
I really can't.

1175
00:56:33.027 --> 00:56:35.428
I'll swallow!

1176
00:56:35.462 --> 00:56:37.497
Call you tomorrow, okay?

1177
00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.015
It's just a mock-up,
it's not the final thing.

1178
00:57:28.049 --> 00:57:31.018
Oh, okay, cool.

1179
00:57:31.052 --> 00:57:32.753
Yeah, I was looking
for a nice way

1180
00:57:32.787 --> 00:57:35.856
to tell you how shitty it is.

1181
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:37.858
I'm kidding!

1182
00:57:37.892 --> 00:57:40.027
Okay, well, what do you think?

1183
00:57:40.061 --> 00:57:42.897
I think I should've
trademarked that.

1184
00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:45.566
Does this mean that
I actually inspired you?

1185
00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:46.667
Don't get cocky.

1186
00:57:46.701 --> 00:57:48.669
Ooh, don't say "cock" around me,
that turns me on.

1187
00:57:48.703 --> 00:57:50.271
Okay, bye-bye, you're done.

1188
00:57:50.304 --> 00:57:52.540
- That was a compliment.
- Don't touch that.

1189
00:57:52.573 --> 00:57:54.608
Okay, I won't.

1190
00:58:03.217 --> 00:58:04.819
Whoa.

1191
00:58:04.852 --> 00:58:06.620
I'm not asking you
if it's boring.

1192
00:58:06.654 --> 00:58:08.923
I'm telling you that you said
that looked fair,

1193
00:58:08.956 --> 00:58:10.157
but it was very foul.

1194
00:58:10.191 --> 00:58:12.760
Oh my God, you are so creepy!

1195
00:58:12.793 --> 00:58:13.894
- Hi.
- Hi.

1196
00:58:13.928 --> 00:58:16.731
Um, Skylar, this is Morgan;
Morgan, this is Skylar.

1197
00:58:16.764 --> 00:58:18.566
- Oh my God, Morgan.
- Hi.

1198
00:58:18.599 --> 00:58:20.534
- Stoked to finally meet you!
- Really?

1199
00:58:20.568 --> 00:58:22.069
Oh my gosh! Yes!

1200
00:58:22.103 --> 00:58:24.305
Oh, uh, I'm gonna get a drink.

1201
00:58:24.338 --> 00:58:25.806
Okay. You can stay.

1202
00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:27.274
I'm just gonna get a drink,
like real...

1203
00:58:27.308 --> 00:58:29.210
- You can go get a drink.
- I'm gonna be like right back.

1204
00:58:29.243 --> 00:58:30.311
- You can stay.
- I promise.

1205
00:58:30.344 --> 00:58:32.580
- You can get a drink.
- It's so good to meet you.

1206
00:58:35.716 --> 00:58:37.985
Are you fucking kidding me?

1207
00:58:38.019 --> 00:58:38.986
I hate...

1208
00:58:40.955 --> 00:58:42.757
- Don't flick me.
- Don't flick me!

1209
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:44.859
Hey, be nice, be nice,
or no more fries!

1210
00:58:44.892 --> 00:58:46.560
I'll be nice.

1211
00:58:46.594 --> 00:58:48.162
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1212
00:58:48.195 --> 00:58:49.430
- Have some more fries.
- Thank you.

1213
00:58:49.463 --> 00:58:52.133
We'll head out of here
as soon as this inning's over.

1214
00:58:52.166 --> 00:58:54.835
Oh, I love it
when you talk frat to me.

1215
00:58:54.869 --> 00:58:57.071
Come here, come here.

1216
00:58:57.938 --> 00:59:00.074
By God, you're still
minty fresh!

1217
00:59:00.107 --> 00:59:02.076
My gum's still minty fresh!

1218
00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:04.145
You have a little Buffalo sauce
on your face.

1219
00:59:04.178 --> 00:59:06.313
- I was saving it for you.
- Yeah?

1220
00:59:06.347 --> 00:59:07.782
You're the sweetest.

1221
00:59:07.815 --> 00:59:09.283
- You have no idea.
- No?

1222
00:59:09.316 --> 00:59:11.886
Reach into my pocket.

1223
00:59:11.919 --> 00:59:13.220
Okay.

1224
00:59:13.254 --> 00:59:14.355
- There you go.
- Yeah?

1225
00:59:14.388 --> 00:59:15.623
- Lower.
- Okay.

1226
00:59:15.656 --> 00:59:16.924
- Grab it.
- Okay.

1227
00:59:16.957 --> 00:59:17.992
Get it!

1228
00:59:18.025 --> 00:59:19.293
That's it!

1229
00:59:19.326 --> 00:59:20.728
- You didn't.
- I did.

1230
00:59:20.761 --> 00:59:22.596
No!

1231
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:23.864
Tums!

1232
00:59:23.898 --> 00:59:26.700
For later,
'cause you burp so much.

1233
00:59:26.734 --> 00:59:28.369
Fuck you, but thank you!

1234
00:59:28.402 --> 00:59:31.639
Hey, Jared, Morgan;
Morgan, Jared.

1235
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:36.010
Hi... Morgan.

1236
00:59:36.043 --> 00:59:37.611
Good to finally meet you.

1237
00:59:37.645 --> 00:59:38.712
Same.

1238
00:59:43.651 --> 00:59:47.922
So, remind me, how long
have you two been together?

1239
00:59:49.023 --> 00:59:51.258
Since February.

1240
00:59:51.292 --> 00:59:53.260
Wow, that...

1241
00:59:53.294 --> 00:59:55.663
that's a long time.

1242
00:59:55.696 --> 00:59:58.199
Jared and I go way back.

1243
00:59:58.232 --> 01:00:00.267
All the way to middle school.

1244
01:00:00.301 --> 01:00:02.036
- No way.
- Way.

1245
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:03.904
Yeah, surprising we still talk,
actually,

1246
01:00:03.938 --> 01:00:05.773
considering how much
we hated each other.

1247
01:00:07.074 --> 01:00:08.876
That's very funny.

1248
01:00:08.909 --> 01:00:11.812
- Hilarious.
- Yeah, he, uh...

1249
01:00:11.846 --> 01:00:13.214
Well, I'll say this
to your face

1250
01:00:13.247 --> 01:00:14.849
'cause you're sitting
right in front of me.

1251
01:00:14.882 --> 01:00:16.317
You were a total dickhole.

1252
01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:17.618
Oh, not in front of the lady.

1253
01:00:17.651 --> 01:00:20.221
He was, he knows that though,
I've told him a million times.

1254
01:00:20.254 --> 01:00:22.690
- Different now.
- He's a changed man.

1255
01:00:23.757 --> 01:00:25.926
Just depends on the day.

1256
01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.729
And yet, here we are,

1257
01:00:28.762 --> 01:00:30.998
all these years later.

1258
01:00:31.031 --> 01:00:31.866
Go!

1259
01:00:31.899 --> 01:00:33.300
- Oh!
- Jesus.

1260
01:00:33.334 --> 01:00:36.003
It's out! It's out!

1261
01:00:36.036 --> 01:00:37.104
This is fun.

1262
01:00:42.343 --> 01:00:43.310
What?

1263
01:00:43.344 --> 01:00:46.080
Are you mad at me?

1264
01:00:46.113 --> 01:00:48.382
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't come over, okay?

1265
01:00:48.415 --> 01:00:50.417
I was half asleep
when you called.

1266
01:00:50.451 --> 01:00:52.186
Okay.

1267
01:00:52.219 --> 01:00:54.054
Let me take you out
to dinner tonight.

1268
01:00:54.088 --> 01:00:56.457
Stop bribing me with food.

1269
01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:58.058
Please.

1270
01:00:58.092 --> 01:00:59.260
Even if I wanted to,

1271
01:00:59.293 --> 01:01:01.762
my head feels like
it's peeling in half.

1272
01:01:01.795 --> 01:01:04.999
So, there's not much movement
going on right now.

1273
01:01:05.032 --> 01:01:07.801
I'll take it.
I'll call you around 6.

1274
01:01:07.835 --> 01:01:11.805
I'll bring you whatever
you want, just text me.

1275
01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:13.774
I love you.

1276
01:01:16.277 --> 01:01:17.478
Shit.

1277
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.017
Hello?

1278
01:01:57.051 --> 01:01:59.253
Sage, hey, it's Aubrey!

1279
01:01:59.286 --> 01:02:01.755
Um, can you work tonight?

1280
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:02.856
Uh...

1281
01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:04.358
I can't tonight.

1282
01:02:04.391 --> 01:02:05.527
Please, Sage.

1283
01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.429
If I get one more write-up,
Laurel is gonna fire me,

1284
01:02:08.462 --> 01:02:09.997
and I can't lose this job.

1285
01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:11.899
I just enrolled in acting class,

1286
01:02:11.932 --> 01:02:13.834
and my agent says
I need to do a self-tape,

1287
01:02:13.867 --> 01:02:14.835
and then
my acting teacher's like,

1288
01:02:14.868 --> 01:02:16.437
"Hey, you should probably take
a yoga class,"

1289
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:18.239
you know, just like,
to loosen up and stuff

1290
01:02:18.272 --> 01:02:20.441
because I'm just really tense
all the fucking time.

1291
01:02:20.474 --> 01:02:21.942
So, how am I gonna afford
a yoga class...

1292
01:02:21.976 --> 01:02:23.244
Did you ask Grace Kim already?

1293
01:02:23.277 --> 01:02:25.012
She quit.

1294
01:02:25.045 --> 01:02:26.046
What, when?

1295
01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:26.880
Like a month ago.

1296
01:02:26.914 --> 01:02:28.816
She got into med school
or something,

1297
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:30.918
which is great,
you know, whatever,

1298
01:02:30.951 --> 01:02:33.087
but I have this huge audition,

1299
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.289
and now I'm totally fucked.

1300
01:02:35.322 --> 01:02:37.391
I'm supposed to be playing
this meth addict

1301
01:02:37.424 --> 01:02:39.561
who finds herself
through violin.

1302
01:02:39.594 --> 01:02:42.363
It's really hard to explain,
but it's a comedy pilot,

1303
01:02:42.396 --> 01:02:44.566
and I just, like,
really need time

1304
01:02:44.599 --> 01:02:50.037
to, like, focus on my craft,
you know?

1305
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:51.506
Please, Sage.

1306
01:02:51.539 --> 01:02:53.140
Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

1307
01:02:53.173 --> 01:02:55.843
Yeah, okay, all right,
fine, yes, I will do it.

1308
01:02:55.876 --> 01:02:58.112
Oh my God, thank you so much!

1309
01:02:58.145 --> 01:02:59.813
You're the fucking best,
I owe you.

1310
01:02:59.847 --> 01:03:01.882
Okay, gotta go, bye.

1311
01:03:01.915 --> 01:03:03.017
We're good, let's do it.

1312
01:03:04.619 --> 01:03:07.154
I done had a long-ass morning.

1313
01:03:07.187 --> 01:03:09.990
The fuck you mean
you can't take my coupon?

1314
01:03:10.024 --> 01:03:12.960
- It's expired.
- By one day.

1315
01:03:12.993 --> 01:03:15.162
Yeah, which makes it expired.

1316
01:03:15.195 --> 01:03:16.997
See, this is some bullshit.

1317
01:03:17.031 --> 01:03:19.366
Okay, I physically can't take
your coupon

1318
01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.102
because the button for it
doesn't exist anymore.

1319
01:03:27.041 --> 01:03:29.143
It's 'cause I'm Black, ain't it?

1320
01:03:30.645 --> 01:03:32.479
Man, fuck this whole
racist-ass shit,

1321
01:03:32.514 --> 01:03:34.381
that little fake-ass smile
you do.

1322
01:03:36.984 --> 01:03:39.253
Fucking white mints.
Fuck your white mints.

1323
01:03:39.286 --> 01:03:41.288
What the hell you lookin' at?
What you holdin'?

1324
01:03:41.322 --> 01:03:42.624
Man, you got shit in your hand.

1325
01:03:42.657 --> 01:03:44.158
Turn around, motherfucker!

1326
01:03:44.191 --> 01:03:45.560
Go back there
and make some coffee.

1327
01:03:45.593 --> 01:03:48.128
Look at me!
Now go make some fucking coffee!

1328
01:03:48.162 --> 01:03:51.065
Y'all motherfuckers just lost
yourselves a valuable customer.

1329
01:03:54.168 --> 01:03:55.369
Great, thanks!

1330
01:03:55.402 --> 01:03:57.371
Thank you so much!

1331
01:04:01.909 --> 01:04:03.377
Sage.

1332
01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:10.050
Now.

1333
01:04:11.285 --> 01:04:13.454
I have my phone
and my wallet,

1334
01:04:13.487 --> 01:04:16.990
but I cannot find my jacket.

1335
01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:19.627
I don't know, I don't know
where your jacket is.

1336
01:04:25.099 --> 01:04:26.300
Duty calls.

1337
01:04:26.333 --> 01:04:28.168
Come here.

1338
01:04:32.172 --> 01:04:33.907
Thank you.

1339
01:04:33.941 --> 01:04:35.409
For what?

1340
01:04:35.442 --> 01:04:37.111
For everything.

1341
01:04:37.144 --> 01:04:41.583
For making me feel wanted
and important.

1342
01:04:41.616 --> 01:04:43.083
Just being nice.

1343
01:04:43.117 --> 01:04:44.485
What's going on?

1344
01:04:44.519 --> 01:04:46.019
Okay.

1345
01:04:46.053 --> 01:04:47.254
I'm just...

1346
01:04:47.287 --> 01:04:51.659
very much in like with you.

1347
01:04:51.693 --> 01:04:53.327
Like love.

1348
01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.197
I'm in like-love with you.

1349
01:04:57.231 --> 01:05:00.267
I've never told anyone that
before,

1350
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.103
and I just thought
you should know that.

1351
01:05:09.443 --> 01:05:12.279
I really like-love you too.

1352
01:05:12.312 --> 01:05:14.481
You don't have to say that.

1353
01:05:14.516 --> 01:05:16.150
I don't care if you do or don't.

1354
01:05:16.183 --> 01:05:18.452
Yet despite your indifference
to my feelings,

1355
01:05:18.485 --> 01:05:20.622
um, I really do.

1356
01:05:22.122 --> 01:05:25.159
Even if you are
a ginormous nerd.

1357
01:05:26.193 --> 01:05:27.394
How dare you?

1358
01:05:27.428 --> 01:05:28.663
You know that I don't
just, like, watch

1359
01:05:28.696 --> 01:05:30.397
that much Harry Potter
for anyone, right?

1360
01:05:30.431 --> 01:05:31.599
You like those movies.

1361
01:05:31.633 --> 01:05:35.002
No, I like those movies because
I have to like those movies.

1362
01:05:35.035 --> 01:05:38.172
Whatever, I watched
The Bachelor for you.

1363
01:05:38.205 --> 01:05:40.742
You promise me that is not
something we will speak of.

1364
01:05:42.342 --> 01:05:44.679
- Promise.
- You won't tell.

1365
01:05:44.712 --> 01:05:46.548
All right, bye.

1366
01:05:46.581 --> 01:05:48.048
Bye.

1367
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:11.773
Okay, bye for real.

1368
01:06:31.593 --> 01:06:33.728
Hey, um,

1369
01:06:33.761 --> 01:06:36.497
it's almost 9 p.m.

1370
01:06:36.531 --> 01:06:39.734
I'm guessing you're not coming
over with dinner anymore.

1371
01:06:42.102 --> 01:06:44.639
Look, I'm not even mad, I just
want to make sure you're okay,

1372
01:06:44.672 --> 01:06:47.140
so... call me back.

1373
01:06:49.544 --> 01:06:51.044
Bye.

1374
01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.362
Hey, congratulations
on your first write-up.

1375
01:07:08.395 --> 01:07:10.632
- It's my second.
- Oh.

1376
01:07:10.665 --> 01:07:12.466
Well, if you want to vent
about it, there's...

1377
01:07:12.499 --> 01:07:15.302
Why, why do you ask when
you know the answer already?

1378
01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:17.304
I thought maybe I caught you
on an off day.

1379
01:07:17.337 --> 01:07:18.673
Nope.

1380
01:07:18.706 --> 01:07:20.040
My bad.

1381
01:07:22.544 --> 01:07:25.680
Shit, there's another
homeless guy.

1382
01:07:27.682 --> 01:07:28.683
Shit.

1383
01:07:30.484 --> 01:07:31.786
Am I overreacting?

1384
01:07:31.819 --> 01:07:34.522
Not at all.
He could've texted or called.

1385
01:07:34.556 --> 01:07:38.258
It's not even that he treats me
bad, per se, it's just like,

1386
01:07:38.292 --> 01:07:41.261
it feels... I don't know,

1387
01:07:41.295 --> 01:07:43.598
like he doesn't even care
if I'm there or if I'm not.

1388
01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:45.600
It's just convenient.
I'm a human Fleshlight.

1389
01:07:45.633 --> 01:07:47.467
He cares about you,
obviously, I mean,

1390
01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:50.470
you guys have been together
since you were, what, 14?

1391
01:07:50.505 --> 01:07:52.439
Sixteen.

1392
01:07:52.472 --> 01:07:54.642
- On and off.
- My point is,

1393
01:07:54.676 --> 01:07:56.644
you cannot take someone
like that seriously.

1394
01:07:56.678 --> 01:07:59.179
It's like... it's like
he's a carnival ride.

1395
01:07:59.212 --> 01:08:00.882
Fun but totally unreliable.

1396
01:08:00.915 --> 01:08:02.149
Great analogy.

1397
01:08:02.182 --> 01:08:03.585
I got stuck on Zipper once.

1398
01:08:03.618 --> 01:08:06.320
It was incredibly traumatic.

1399
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:08.823
I'm sorry.

1400
01:08:08.856 --> 01:08:11.526
I hate being that person
that's always...

1401
01:08:11.559 --> 01:08:13.528
crying about a boyfriend,
it's embarrassing.

1402
01:08:13.561 --> 01:08:14.762
If it makes you feel any better,

1403
01:08:14.796 --> 01:08:16.864
you're definitely the best
customer we've had all day.

1404
01:08:16.898 --> 01:08:20.400
It's true, yeah.

1405
01:08:20.434 --> 01:08:22.402
Casey, I know you don't want
to hear this,

1406
01:08:22.436 --> 01:08:24.772
but the dude is
a self-indulgent twig

1407
01:08:24.806 --> 01:08:25.907
with a faux hawk.

1408
01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:27.842
- Oh...
- I don't know the guy,

1409
01:08:27.875 --> 01:08:29.744
but that sends
a lot of red flags.

1410
01:08:29.777 --> 01:08:31.278
Kyle!

1411
01:08:31.311 --> 01:08:33.447
I was talking to myself.

1412
01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.283
Okay, the faux hawk was a phase.

1413
01:08:36.316 --> 01:08:38.485
I can't believe
we're having this conversation.

1414
01:08:38.519 --> 01:08:41.421
Well, maybe this is the push
you need to move on.

1415
01:08:41.455 --> 01:08:43.490
Stop prolonging
your own suffering.

1416
01:08:45.827 --> 01:08:47.194
You want some more tea?

1417
01:08:47.227 --> 01:08:48.863
Oh, I have a whiskey flask
in the back.

1418
01:08:48.896 --> 01:08:50.765
I can make you a hot toddy
or something.

1419
01:08:50.798 --> 01:08:51.833
Absolutely.

1420
01:08:51.866 --> 01:08:54.201
Are you sure you want
to be drinking right now?

1421
01:08:54.234 --> 01:08:56.571
Please let me mourn
without judgment.

1422
01:08:56.604 --> 01:08:59.473
You know, the best way
to get over someone

1423
01:08:59.507 --> 01:09:01.441
is to get under someone.

1424
01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:03.845
Consider this:

1425
01:09:03.878 --> 01:09:04.812
orgy.

1426
01:09:04.846 --> 01:09:06.614
Okay, do you want to go drink
at my house?

1427
01:09:06.648 --> 01:09:07.615
- Yes!
- Okay.

1428
01:09:07.649 --> 01:09:08.883
- We're leaving.
- Can I come?

1429
01:09:08.916 --> 01:09:09.851
Nope.

1430
01:09:09.884 --> 01:09:10.785
- Why not?
- Not invited.

1431
01:09:10.818 --> 01:09:12.520
Because you have to stay here
and clean.

1432
01:09:12.553 --> 01:09:14.522
- Okay.
- Later days.

1433
01:09:14.555 --> 01:09:16.858
- I love you.
- Bye.

1434
01:09:19.627 --> 01:09:21.328
Fuck.

1435
01:09:32.006 --> 01:09:33.608
Hello?

1436
01:09:38.579 --> 01:09:41.348
Thank you for letting me eat
Lowick's pizza.

1437
01:09:41.381 --> 01:09:42.550
And his wine.

1438
01:09:42.583 --> 01:09:45.920
It was a surprise anyway,
so he won't know the difference.

1439
01:09:45.953 --> 01:09:47.689
You know, you can put
the shoe down.

1440
01:09:47.722 --> 01:09:49.824
It's not gonna make the glue
dry any faster.

1441
01:09:49.857 --> 01:09:52.292
- It's my favorite pair.
- Dude, you're fine.

1442
01:09:52.325 --> 01:09:55.395
That stuff can glue a baby
to the back of a bus.

1443
01:09:57.330 --> 01:09:59.600
Okay, that would never happen,
never.

1444
01:09:59.634 --> 01:10:01.669
Yeah, 'cause
the Lifetime Movie Network

1445
01:10:01.703 --> 01:10:03.470
is known for its realism.

1446
01:10:03.503 --> 01:10:05.707
Suspension of disbelief.

1447
01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.508
Dude, now I'm in
on a Friday night.

1448
01:10:07.542 --> 01:10:08.810
Just when I was
starting to feel

1449
01:10:08.843 --> 01:10:10.343
a little bit better
about myself.

1450
01:10:10.377 --> 01:10:11.813
Hey, you're not watching alone.

1451
01:10:11.846 --> 01:10:13.581
That's true, feel you.

1452
01:10:13.614 --> 01:10:15.550
You know what?

1453
01:10:15.583 --> 01:10:19.453
So what we're not getting
shit-faced on a Friday night.

1454
01:10:19.486 --> 01:10:21.321
We're bonding!

1455
01:10:21.354 --> 01:10:23.323
Big deal!

1456
01:10:23.356 --> 01:10:26.627
I mean, there is nothing
to be ashamed of.

1457
01:10:26.661 --> 01:10:31.498
Whatever happened to real,
intellectual conversation?

1458
01:10:33.534 --> 01:10:35.302
We are watching a TV movie

1459
01:10:35.335 --> 01:10:37.404
about a teenager
trying to steal a fetus.

1460
01:10:37.437 --> 01:10:41.274
I don't think that qualifies
as intellectual conversation.

1461
01:10:41.308 --> 01:10:43.578
So then... let's talk.

1462
01:10:43.611 --> 01:10:45.747
- About what?
- Anything.

1463
01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.983
- Except boys.
- Or work.

1464
01:10:51.652 --> 01:10:52.887
Thanks.

1465
01:10:55.089 --> 01:10:57.390
- I have a question.
- Splash zone.

1466
01:10:59.392 --> 01:11:01.495
What, what's your question?

1467
01:11:01.529 --> 01:11:03.564
Are you guys' vaginas
symmetrical?

1468
01:11:03.598 --> 01:11:06.333
Morgan!

1469
01:11:06.366 --> 01:11:08.035
Elaborate.

1470
01:11:08.069 --> 01:11:10.571
I just feel like
the right side of mine

1471
01:11:10.605 --> 01:11:12.039
is just a little bit longer.

1472
01:11:12.073 --> 01:11:13.908
- The inside or the outside?
- Inside.

1473
01:11:13.941 --> 01:11:16.577
It's not hugely noticeable,
it's just...

1474
01:11:16.611 --> 01:11:19.046
It just feels like
it's just a little bit longer.

1475
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.581
Mine is like that on the left.

1476
01:11:20.615 --> 01:11:23.718
- Like you have to tuck it in?
- Ew, you guys!

1477
01:11:24.819 --> 01:11:25.853
Well, thank you.

1478
01:11:25.887 --> 01:11:27.588
That's all I needed to hear.

1479
01:11:27.622 --> 01:11:28.923
Oh my God.

1480
01:11:31.025 --> 01:11:32.960
- What?
- It's Nathan, what do I do?

1481
01:11:32.994 --> 01:11:34.796
- You ignore it.
- Mm-hmm.

1482
01:11:34.829 --> 01:11:35.863
That's what you do.

1483
01:11:35.897 --> 01:11:37.632
No, but I just want to know
what his excuse is.

1484
01:11:37.665 --> 01:11:39.366
- No, no!
- Who cares?

1485
01:11:39.399 --> 01:11:40.234
I do!

1486
01:11:40.268 --> 01:11:42.603
Casey, don't answer that,
come on.

1487
01:11:42.637 --> 01:11:44.071
Just, okay,
just talk really loud

1488
01:11:44.105 --> 01:11:45.907
like we're out and we're having
a really fun time

1489
01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:46.874
and we're at a party
or something.

1490
01:11:46.908 --> 01:11:51.478
- Just do it!
- Um, I am having so much fun!

1491
01:11:53.446 --> 01:11:56.717
Oh my God, you guys, stop,
you're hilarious!

1492
01:11:56.751 --> 01:11:57.718
Hello?

1493
01:11:57.752 --> 01:12:00.021
Hey, babe, it's me... shut up.

1494
01:12:00.054 --> 01:12:01.823
Who?

1495
01:12:01.856 --> 01:12:02.890
Nathan.

1496
01:12:02.924 --> 01:12:04.091
Oh, hey, what's up?

1497
01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:07.762
Sorry, it's just so loud
at this party that I'm at.

1498
01:12:07.795 --> 01:12:09.964
Is... is that Morgan?

1499
01:12:09.997 --> 01:12:11.732
Uh, yeah, it is.

1500
01:12:11.766 --> 01:12:12.867
She's... she's with me.

1501
01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:14.602
You know what, one second.

1502
01:12:16.003 --> 01:12:17.505
I'm in the bathroom now.

1503
01:12:17.538 --> 01:12:18.840
Sorry, crazy in there.

1504
01:12:18.873 --> 01:12:21.474
But enough about my night.
Where are you?

1505
01:12:21.509 --> 01:12:22.810
I thought we had plans.

1506
01:12:22.844 --> 01:12:24.712
Yeah, I know, look, I'm sorry,

1507
01:12:24.745 --> 01:12:27.782
but Max had tickets to go see
Chance the Rapper last minute,

1508
01:12:27.815 --> 01:12:31.484
and then my phone died,
so, um...

1509
01:12:31.519 --> 01:12:33.554
Anyway, we're at
this after-party now,

1510
01:12:33.588 --> 01:12:36.891
and I finally found a charger
so I can call you.

1511
01:12:36.924 --> 01:12:38.960
You're at... you're at
an after-party right now?

1512
01:12:39.994 --> 01:12:41.394
Yeah, yeah.

1513
01:12:41.428 --> 01:12:43.564
Look, I... I owe you

1514
01:12:43.598 --> 01:12:46.433
and I will make this up to you,
I promise.

1515
01:12:46.466 --> 01:12:50.470
But it sounds like you're having
a really good time anyway.

1516
01:12:50.503 --> 01:12:51.672
Yeah, I am.

1517
01:12:51.706 --> 01:12:55.910
You know, I am
at an after-party too, actually.

1518
01:12:55.943 --> 01:12:57.511
For Ludacris.

1519
01:12:57.545 --> 01:12:59.180
Wait, what, you're at an...

1520
01:12:59.213 --> 01:13:01.182
you're at an after-party
for Ludacris?

1521
01:13:01.215 --> 01:13:04.652
We are having a banging time,
and I mean that literally.

1522
01:13:04.685 --> 01:13:07.521
I let him and his rapper friends
gang-bang me

1523
01:13:07.555 --> 01:13:09.924
with their big, huge cocks!

1524
01:13:09.957 --> 01:13:12.093
Oh, oh, oh, here they come.

1525
01:13:12.126 --> 01:13:14.829
- Okay.
- Banging on the bathroom door.

1526
01:13:14.862 --> 01:13:15.730
Ooh!

1527
01:13:15.763 --> 01:13:19.634
Uh... this bathroom,
it's so shiny.

1528
01:13:19.667 --> 01:13:21.168
- So nice!
- I'm sorry,

1529
01:13:21.202 --> 01:13:22.870
what were you saying?

1530
01:13:22.904 --> 01:13:24.205
Casey, look, I'm sorry.

1531
01:13:24.238 --> 01:13:26.107
I guess I messed up, didn't I?

1532
01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.541
- So, um...
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

1533
01:13:27.575 --> 01:13:29.442
it's just so hard
to hear you because

1534
01:13:29.476 --> 01:13:30.912
Pharrell jizzed
in my ears earlier,

1535
01:13:30.945 --> 01:13:34.081
and the semen is making it
really hard to hear.

1536
01:13:34.115 --> 01:13:39.220
Just a big, fat wad
of non-rubber rapper jizz

1537
01:13:39.253 --> 01:13:40.888
all in my mouth!

1538
01:13:40.922 --> 01:13:42.957
Woo! Oh, oh my God!

1539
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:47.862
Kid Cudi, your balls
are so fucking soft!

1540
01:13:47.895 --> 01:13:52.733
Okay, you know what, um,
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

1541
01:13:55.502 --> 01:13:57.104
He hung up.

1542
01:13:57.138 --> 01:13:59.240
You're fine.

1543
01:13:59.273 --> 01:14:02.043
Yeah, it was really articulate.

1544
01:14:09.216 --> 01:14:10.985
Hi.

1545
01:14:12.787 --> 01:14:14.855
Hi.

1546
01:14:14.889 --> 01:14:16.023
Long night?

1547
01:14:17.925 --> 01:14:19.961
Very.

1548
01:14:19.994 --> 01:14:22.530
Thought you'd be in bed by now.

1549
01:14:23.698 --> 01:14:26.033
Uh, yeah, I, uh...

1550
01:14:26.067 --> 01:14:28.035
couldn't sleep.

1551
01:14:28.069 --> 01:14:29.904
Casey wasn't feeling well,

1552
01:14:29.937 --> 01:14:33.274
so I was with her and Sage.

1553
01:14:33.307 --> 01:14:35.943
Were you?

1554
01:14:35.977 --> 01:14:41.582
Yeah, hence... leftover pizza.

1555
01:14:41.615 --> 01:14:45.152
There was more,
but the other pieces got mugged.

1556
01:14:45.186 --> 01:14:46.787
Yeah, I'm not really hungry.

1557
01:14:46.821 --> 01:14:48.022
I, um...

1558
01:14:51.692 --> 01:14:53.627
I got dinner with Jared.

1559
01:14:58.833 --> 01:15:00.134
Oh.

1560
01:15:04.105 --> 01:15:06.574
Yeah.

1561
01:15:06.607 --> 01:15:08.309
Why didn't you tell me?

1562
01:15:08.342 --> 01:15:10.644
I didn't know how.

1563
01:15:10.678 --> 01:15:14.648
Were you planning
on telling me?

1564
01:15:14.682 --> 01:15:17.551
I don't know.

1565
01:15:17.585 --> 01:15:22.023
I was embarrassed, okay?

1566
01:15:22.056 --> 01:15:24.058
You were embarrassed?

1567
01:15:25.026 --> 01:15:26.994
Imagine how I felt

1568
01:15:27.028 --> 01:15:28.562
when my best friend told me

1569
01:15:28.596 --> 01:15:30.564
that my girlfriend
fucks for money.

1570
01:15:30.598 --> 01:15:31.766
Fucked.

1571
01:15:31.799 --> 01:15:34.068
Past tense.

1572
01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:38.072
Just out of curiosity,
when was the last guy?

1573
01:15:38.105 --> 01:15:40.841
Was it the week we met?

1574
01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:44.045
Was it the day we met?

1575
01:15:48.182 --> 01:15:50.184
Okay, um...

1576
01:15:53.988 --> 01:15:56.190
Right, I guess next topic,

1577
01:15:56.223 --> 01:15:59.593
are there... are there any kids

1578
01:15:59.627 --> 01:16:01.896
that I should know about?

1579
01:16:01.929 --> 01:16:04.265
No?

1580
01:16:04.298 --> 01:16:06.600
Okay, well, that's good,
no kids.

1581
01:16:06.634 --> 01:16:08.135
Um...

1582
01:16:08.169 --> 01:16:09.637
Do you run a drug cartel?

1583
01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:10.905
I wanted to tell you.

1584
01:16:10.938 --> 01:16:12.239
God, Morgan, you...

1585
01:16:12.273 --> 01:16:14.108
you lied to me.

1586
01:16:14.141 --> 01:16:16.944
I didn't lie.

1587
01:16:16.977 --> 01:16:19.814
Come on.

1588
01:16:29.957 --> 01:16:34.662
You know, I really think that...
I need to be alone tonight.

1589
01:16:34.695 --> 01:16:36.063
Lowick, it's three
in the morning.

1590
01:16:36.097 --> 01:16:37.364
I know it's three
in the morning,

1591
01:16:37.398 --> 01:16:39.100
but I don't think
it's a good idea

1592
01:16:39.133 --> 01:16:41.402
that we be in the same room
right now.

1593
01:16:41.435 --> 01:16:43.704
- Please, let's just go to bed.
- Morgan, um,

1594
01:16:43.737 --> 01:16:45.639
I need you to leave.

1595
01:16:47.808 --> 01:16:50.644
Please.

1596
01:16:50.678 --> 01:16:54.115
I'm... please,
I'm asking you to leave.

1597
01:17:02.723 --> 01:17:04.291
I'll, um...

1598
01:17:08.963 --> 01:17:11.832
I'll, um, put the pizza
in the fridge.

1599
01:17:11.866 --> 01:17:14.068
It's your favorite, by the way.

1600
01:17:14.101 --> 01:17:17.738
Um, pepperoni and olive
on gluten-free crust,

1601
01:17:17.771 --> 01:17:20.407
even though gluten-free doesn't
really constitute as pizza,

1602
01:17:20.441 --> 01:17:22.443
but, you know, I got it anyways
because you like it,

1603
01:17:22.476 --> 01:17:25.412
- and I thought you'd want some...
- Morgan.

1604
01:17:25.446 --> 01:17:27.248
Yeah.

1605
01:17:30.751 --> 01:17:33.320
You can leave my key
on the counter.

1606
01:17:37.324 --> 01:17:40.294
Yeah, um...

1607
01:17:41.862 --> 01:17:44.865
I'll, um...

1608
01:17:44.899 --> 01:17:47.701
I'll leave it right here
next to the pizza.

1609
01:18:55.202 --> 01:18:58.005
Late night with Pharrell?

1610
01:18:58.038 --> 01:18:59.940
- Can we talk?
- No.

1611
01:18:59.974 --> 01:19:01.475
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

1612
01:19:01.509 --> 01:19:03.210
We both fucked up,
let's just reset and...

1613
01:19:03.244 --> 01:19:05.479
No, I didn't fuck up.

1614
01:19:05.513 --> 01:19:06.981
You fucked up.

1615
01:19:07.014 --> 01:19:09.149
Can we handle this
like adults, please?

1616
01:19:09.183 --> 01:19:11.485
You know what, no,
we can't handle this like adults

1617
01:19:11.519 --> 01:19:13.854
because you are not an adult.

1618
01:19:13.887 --> 01:19:15.523
- You are a child.
- Casey...

1619
01:19:15.557 --> 01:19:17.424
- And I cant do this anymore.
- Come on.

1620
01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:19.126
- I'm done.
- Doing what?

1621
01:19:19.159 --> 01:19:21.862
You lie every time you say
you're coming over...

1622
01:19:21.895 --> 01:19:24.832
I will come over, it's just...
sometimes shit comes up.

1623
01:19:24.865 --> 01:19:26.066
- Shit comes up!
- Shit comes up

1624
01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:27.968
like a Chance the Rapper
fucking after-party?

1625
01:19:28.002 --> 01:19:29.336
Are you out
of your goddamn mind?

1626
01:19:29.370 --> 01:19:30.938
You know he's
my favorite fucking artist!

1627
01:19:30.971 --> 01:19:34.108
Oh my God!

1628
01:19:34.141 --> 01:19:35.577
What the fuck?

1629
01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:36.977
Take your bag of shit,

1630
01:19:37.011 --> 01:19:38.580
lose my number,
and get the hell out!

1631
01:19:38.613 --> 01:19:40.414
Chill the fuck out,
you're being dramatic, okay?

1632
01:19:42.082 --> 01:19:43.951
What did you just say to me?

1633
01:19:43.984 --> 01:19:45.319
You honestly think
you're not making this

1634
01:19:45.352 --> 01:19:48.222
a much bigger deal
than it is, really?

1635
01:19:50.491 --> 01:19:51.392
Fuck, what the fuck!

1636
01:19:51.425 --> 01:19:53.427
Now you're liable
to call me dramatic!

1637
01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.530
Oh, you fucking punched me!

1638
01:19:55.563 --> 01:19:57.931
You fucking punched me!

1639
01:19:57.965 --> 01:19:59.967
Ah, fuck!

1640
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.971
I come all the way out here
to check on you...

1641
01:20:04.004 --> 01:20:05.205
and make sure you're okay.

1642
01:20:05.239 --> 01:20:08.342
The least you can do is come
outside and talk to me, babe.

1643
01:20:11.513 --> 01:20:14.214
Come on, just...

1644
01:20:14.248 --> 01:20:17.184
Just come outside
and talk to me.

1645
01:20:18.419 --> 01:20:19.621
Please.

1646
01:20:23.257 --> 01:20:25.459
Ah, fuck.

1647
01:20:27.394 --> 01:20:29.396
Thank you...
Woah, dude, what the fuck!

1648
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:31.432
Number one,
don't fucking call me dramatic.

1649
01:20:31.465 --> 01:20:33.334
I didn't mean it like that,
I didn't mean it like that!

1650
01:20:33.367 --> 01:20:35.202
Two, don't call me dude!

1651
01:20:35.235 --> 01:20:36.870
Will you put
the fucking knife down?

1652
01:20:36.904 --> 01:20:38.339
And three,
I have a fucking hangover,

1653
01:20:38.372 --> 01:20:40.140
so stop pounding on my door!

1654
01:20:40.174 --> 01:20:42.209
Casey, what the fuck!

1655
01:20:45.112 --> 01:20:47.915
Get the fuck outta here,
I swear to God,

1656
01:20:47.948 --> 01:20:49.517
I'll fucking cut you!

1657
01:20:51.352 --> 01:20:53.087
Will you just stop and listen?

1658
01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.189
I don't know how to tell you
to calm down

1659
01:20:55.222 --> 01:20:56.056
without offending you.

1660
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:58.425
Just chill out
so we can talk, okay?

1661
01:20:58.459 --> 01:21:01.095
And if you stab me,
it won't count as self-defense,

1662
01:21:01.128 --> 01:21:02.429
so please.

1663
01:21:02.463 --> 01:21:04.198
Just talk to me.

1664
01:21:05.466 --> 01:21:07.569
I think we should break up.

1665
01:21:08.936 --> 01:21:10.904
What?

1666
01:21:46.741 --> 01:21:48.175
You're back.

1667
01:21:48.208 --> 01:21:51.178
Let me guess,
they bumped you up to CEO.

1668
01:21:52.079 --> 01:21:54.281
Still assistant,
but I feel very strongly

1669
01:21:54.314 --> 01:21:55.717
an offer's about to be made.

1670
01:21:58.385 --> 01:22:00.454
Celebratory drink.

1671
01:22:00.487 --> 01:22:01.689
That's fast service.

1672
01:22:01.723 --> 01:22:03.290
Yeah, I'll be right back.

1673
01:22:04.358 --> 01:22:05.727
Don't go anywhere.

1674
01:22:06.661 --> 01:22:09.496
I could also stay,
if you want company.

1675
01:22:09.531 --> 01:22:12.132
- It's not a big deal.
- No, you should go.

1676
01:22:12.166 --> 01:22:13.434
Yeah, no, I've already left.

1677
01:22:13.467 --> 01:22:15.502
- I'm not even here.
- Okay.

1678
01:22:15.537 --> 01:22:17.971
- Huh, who are you?
- Go, leave me alone.

1679
01:22:18.005 --> 01:22:18.972
Okay.

1680
01:23:57.772 --> 01:24:00.808
Oh, fuck.

1681
01:24:10.818 --> 01:24:13.320
Uh-uh, don't, no.

1682
01:24:13.353 --> 01:24:15.823
No, we offered him
two extensions.

1683
01:24:15.857 --> 01:24:17.424
This book needs
to be ready to print

1684
01:24:17.457 --> 01:24:18.593
before the end of the year.

1685
01:24:18.626 --> 01:24:21.663
If the proposal's not on my desk
by the end of this week,

1686
01:24:21.696 --> 01:24:23.397
he can take the material
somewhere else

1687
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:26.133
and stop wasting my time.

1688
01:24:29.604 --> 01:24:31.104
- Morgan.
- Yes.

1689
01:24:31.138 --> 01:24:32.674
I don't have a lot of time,
don't sit.

1690
01:24:32.707 --> 01:24:33.608
Okay.

1691
01:24:33.641 --> 01:24:35.442
Finally got word back
about that sample

1692
01:24:35.475 --> 01:24:37.477
you had me forward
to Illustration.

1693
01:24:37.512 --> 01:24:39.212
Turns out the department's
very interested.

1694
01:24:39.246 --> 01:24:41.248
- Really?
- But that's all they expressed.

1695
01:24:41.281 --> 01:24:43.818
Interest, okay?
Nothing set in stone.

1696
01:24:43.851 --> 01:24:45.520
- Okay.
- They have a few ideas they want

1697
01:24:45.553 --> 01:24:48.221
to go over, so can you set up
a meeting for next week?

1698
01:24:48.255 --> 01:24:50.424
Also, push my 5 p.m.
to next Wednesday.

1699
01:24:50.457 --> 01:24:51.793
I need to leave
the office early.

1700
01:24:51.826 --> 01:24:53.528
Yeah, absolutely.

1701
01:24:53.561 --> 01:24:57.765
Oh, why does my cappuccino
taste like a mocha?

1702
01:24:57.799 --> 01:24:59.801
Um, the barista was new,

1703
01:24:59.834 --> 01:25:02.202
so maybe she made it wrong.

1704
01:25:02.235 --> 01:25:03.705
I don't get it.
One job, make coffee,

1705
01:25:03.738 --> 01:25:05.807
and somehow it's
an impossible feat?

1706
01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.775
Truly amazes me.

1707
01:25:07.809 --> 01:25:09.777
What are you doing here?

1708
01:25:09.811 --> 01:25:11.779
Oh, just living out
the no-condom mistake

1709
01:25:11.813 --> 01:25:12.847
my parents made.

1710
01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.849
I meant here at work.

1711
01:25:14.882 --> 01:25:17.885
Is the answer to that
not self-explanatory?

1712
01:25:19.821 --> 01:25:21.188
- Rough morning?
- Yeah.

1713
01:25:21.221 --> 01:25:23.357
I was up until five
working on some pieces.

1714
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:25.192
I thought Aubrey
was on the schedule.

1715
01:25:25.225 --> 01:25:26.193
Yeah, she was.

1716
01:25:26.226 --> 01:25:28.328
I got the honor
of covering her.

1717
01:25:28.362 --> 01:25:31.365
Why does she work here
if she's never going to show up?

1718
01:25:31.398 --> 01:25:33.166
Well, she doesn't work here
anymore.

1719
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.535
She finally got herself fired?

1720
01:25:34.569 --> 01:25:37.170
No, she booked a series regular
or something

1721
01:25:37.204 --> 01:25:41.308
on, uh, some shitty sitcom.

1722
01:25:41.341 --> 01:25:42.577
Yeah, I don't get it either.

1723
01:25:42.610 --> 01:25:43.811
I never thought
she was that funny,

1724
01:25:43.845 --> 01:25:47.882
but, hey, that just goes to show
the quality of American humor.

1725
01:25:49.282 --> 01:25:50.384
You okay?

1726
01:25:50.417 --> 01:25:51.919
Yup, fine.

1727
01:25:51.953 --> 01:25:54.454
- That's clearly a lie.
- You kidding?

1728
01:25:54.488 --> 01:25:57.257
I love when untalented people
achieve success.

1729
01:25:57.290 --> 01:26:01.361
It really... reaffirms
my life choices.

1730
01:26:15.576 --> 01:26:16.544
Check this out.

1731
01:26:16.577 --> 01:26:19.814
Ew, stop, that was on the floor!

1732
01:26:19.847 --> 01:26:22.684
Come on, let's go.

1733
01:26:22.717 --> 01:26:24.519
Hey, hey!

1734
01:26:24.552 --> 01:26:26.353
Hi, yeah, I'm talking to you.

1735
01:26:26.386 --> 01:26:28.455
First of all, you shouldn't
even be using straws

1736
01:26:28.488 --> 01:26:29.590
because our planet is dying.

1737
01:26:29.624 --> 01:26:31.358
Secondly, pick up
your used shit,

1738
01:26:31.391 --> 01:26:32.727
you fucking privileged ingrate.

1739
01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.662
What the hell are you doing?

1740
01:26:34.696 --> 01:26:37.431
Pick up your shit.

1741
01:26:45.305 --> 01:26:46.974
Sage!

1742
01:26:52.914 --> 01:26:55.883
The beans were actually
handpicked by Korean amputees.

1743
01:26:55.917 --> 01:26:58.953
Well, those who had hands,
anyways.

1744
01:27:01.055 --> 01:27:02.657
Uh, excuse me...

1745
01:27:07.427 --> 01:27:09.931
Sage, hey, wait up.

1746
01:27:09.964 --> 01:27:10.998
Green tea latte.

1747
01:27:11.032 --> 01:27:12.767
I wanted to... I don't know,

1748
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.902
give you something
to remember me by.

1749
01:27:15.837 --> 01:27:18.806
Huh, thank you.

1750
01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.042
It's, uh,

1751
01:27:21.075 --> 01:27:24.277
it's really gonna suck
not working with you.

1752
01:27:24.311 --> 01:27:25.813
Yeah, well, I guess
you're gonna have to find

1753
01:27:25.847 --> 01:27:27.782
someone else
to sexually harass now, huh?

1754
01:27:27.815 --> 01:27:30.952
Oh, I've had my eye on Jeff
for a while, we're good.

1755
01:27:30.985 --> 01:27:32.285
Well, it's a good pick.

1756
01:27:32.319 --> 01:27:36.657
He's scrawny, so you'll be able
to pin him easy when he resists.

1757
01:27:36.691 --> 01:27:38.258
Yeah, yeah.

1758
01:27:42.864 --> 01:27:44.031
Yeah.

1759
01:27:44.065 --> 01:27:45.398
Well, uh...

1760
01:27:47.034 --> 01:27:49.336
Bye, Sage.

1761
01:27:50.571 --> 01:27:51.672
Bye.

1762
01:27:53.373 --> 01:27:54.709
Yeah.

1763
01:28:08.956 --> 01:28:10.625
I don't get grinding.

1764
01:28:10.658 --> 01:28:12.593
It's for people who have
nothing to talk about

1765
01:28:12.627 --> 01:28:14.529
but want to fuck.

1766
01:28:14.562 --> 01:28:16.697
So why don't they just have sex?

1767
01:28:16.731 --> 01:28:19.734
Because we live in a society
where people can't just be like,

1768
01:28:19.767 --> 01:28:22.737
"Hey, you wanna fuck?"
"Yeah, okay, cool!"

1769
01:28:22.770 --> 01:28:24.639
And they have to, like,
play hard-to-get

1770
01:28:24.672 --> 01:28:27.508
and keep their dignity and shit,
so they come here

1771
01:28:27.542 --> 01:28:28.976
and bang their genitals
against each other

1772
01:28:29.010 --> 01:28:31.913
so they feel like
they applied some effort.

1773
01:28:31.946 --> 01:28:35.049
It's low-culture socioecology.

1774
01:28:36.449 --> 01:28:38.820
- Oh, hello.
- Ah, perfect timing.

1775
01:28:38.853 --> 01:28:40.087
If you enjoy critical thinking,

1776
01:28:40.121 --> 01:28:41.622
you're gonna want
to check this out.

1777
01:28:41.656 --> 01:28:42.857
Move, scooch.

1778
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:43.991
Oh, you need to sit here?

1779
01:28:46.928 --> 01:28:47.862
Sorry.

1780
01:28:51.866 --> 01:28:53.568
I want to make a toast.

1781
01:28:53.601 --> 01:28:56.503
To my early retirement
and inevitable suicide?

1782
01:28:56.537 --> 01:28:58.573
You guys,
I can't toast with water.

1783
01:28:58.606 --> 01:29:00.575
It's bad sex for seven years.

1784
01:29:00.608 --> 01:29:03.544
Oh, yeah, because we've had
such good sex up until now.

1785
01:29:03.578 --> 01:29:05.680
- Speak for yourself.
- Okay, Sage,

1786
01:29:05.713 --> 01:29:09.083
you can stop being upset about
the life-sucking coffeehouse

1787
01:29:09.116 --> 01:29:11.819
because
the Illustration department

1788
01:29:11.853 --> 01:29:13.688
loved your book sample.

1789
01:29:13.721 --> 01:29:14.789
- What?
- Yup.

1790
01:29:14.822 --> 01:29:16.456
They want to meet with you
next week.

1791
01:29:16.489 --> 01:29:18.458
- Congratulations.
- Are you messing with me?

1792
01:29:18.491 --> 01:29:20.528
I'm not that cruel, okay?

1793
01:29:20.561 --> 01:29:23.130
Sagey, what,
I'm so proud of you!

1794
01:29:23.164 --> 01:29:26.466
You're too talented to be stuck
behind a register anyways.

1795
01:29:26.499 --> 01:29:27.568
Yeah.

1796
01:29:27.602 --> 01:29:30.605
And I know this is only one
of many amazing things

1797
01:29:30.638 --> 01:29:33.541
that you're gonna accomplish
in your lifetime.

1798
01:29:33.574 --> 01:29:35.442
So I'm really glad
that you cussed out

1799
01:29:35.475 --> 01:29:38.145
a group of minors
and got yourself fired!

1800
01:29:38.179 --> 01:29:40.648
- Thank you.
- I love you guys.

1801
01:29:40.681 --> 01:29:42.149
Oh, we love you too.

1802
01:29:42.183 --> 01:29:43.416
What the fuck!

1803
01:29:43.450 --> 01:29:44.952
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1804
01:29:44.986 --> 01:29:46.120
Wrong with me?

1805
01:29:52.059 --> 01:29:54.929
Can I have another napkin,
please?

1806
01:29:54.962 --> 01:29:56.631
Excuse me.

1807
01:29:57.932 --> 01:29:59.000
Sorry.

1808
01:30:00.601 --> 01:30:01.769
Hi.

1809
01:30:01.802 --> 01:30:03.137
Hey.

1810
01:30:05.072 --> 01:30:08.441
Some bitch spilled my drink
on Sage, so...

1811
01:30:08.475 --> 01:30:09.442
Hi.

1812
01:30:09.476 --> 01:30:10.945
Good to see you guys.

1813
01:30:11.846 --> 01:30:13.514
Hi, I'm Morgan.

1814
01:30:13.547 --> 01:30:14.849
Sarah.

1815
01:30:14.882 --> 01:30:17.151
Love your dress, very fancy.

1816
01:30:17.184 --> 01:30:19.452
- Thank you.
- We're out celebrating

1817
01:30:19.486 --> 01:30:20.988
because Sage may get
a book deal.

1818
01:30:21.022 --> 01:30:22.823
That's amazing, congratulations.

1819
01:30:22.857 --> 01:30:24.825
Thanks!

1820
01:30:24.859 --> 01:30:26.093
What's your book about?

1821
01:30:26.127 --> 01:30:27.762
It's an art book.

1822
01:30:27.795 --> 01:30:29.764
All drawings
of morbid life moments

1823
01:30:29.797 --> 01:30:32.033
that involve coffee,
which I incidentally named

1824
01:30:32.066 --> 01:30:33.634
"The Coffee Table Book."

1825
01:30:35.937 --> 01:30:38.205
I'm not very good
at pitching it, clearly.

1826
01:30:38.239 --> 01:30:40.074
No, it sounds cute!

1827
01:30:41.742 --> 01:30:42.977
Thanks.

1828
01:30:45.146 --> 01:30:47.214
So, you're on a date then?

1829
01:30:48.182 --> 01:30:49.216
Uh, yeah.

1830
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:51.786
This would... be a date.

1831
01:30:51.819 --> 01:30:54.155
All right, well...

1832
01:30:54.188 --> 01:30:55.056
there you go.

1833
01:30:55.089 --> 01:30:58.926
Okay, um, Sarah,
pleasure to meet you,

1834
01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:01.562
and again, lovely dress.

1835
01:31:01.595 --> 01:31:03.564
Glad you're doing well.

1836
01:31:04.732 --> 01:31:06.033
Fantastic.

1837
01:31:10.204 --> 01:31:11.639
Bye.

1838
01:31:17.244 --> 01:31:19.880
- You okay?
- Hmm.

1839
01:31:19.914 --> 01:31:21.615
If it makes you feel
any better,

1840
01:31:21.649 --> 01:31:24.251
he looked more happy to see you
than terrified.

1841
01:31:24.285 --> 01:31:26.187
I have to tell him
that I have it?

1842
01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:27.888
No, you're good.
If you have, like, herpes,

1843
01:31:27.922 --> 01:31:29.824
then you have to tell him,
but not HPV

1844
01:31:29.857 --> 01:31:31.158
because they can't get it.

1845
01:31:31.192 --> 01:31:32.860
Can we please talk

1846
01:31:32.893 --> 01:31:35.129
about that girl
all over Brett, though?

1847
01:31:35.162 --> 01:31:36.831
- Super extra.
- Right.

1848
01:31:36.864 --> 01:31:39.266
- But she's a hooker, so...
- Shut up.

1849
01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:41.669
She's been with, like,
a ton of old dudes.

1850
01:31:41.702 --> 01:31:42.636
Stop, I can't even.

1851
01:31:42.670 --> 01:31:44.305
I don't care how much money
you pay me,

1852
01:31:44.338 --> 01:31:45.873
I'd fucking kill myself.

1853
01:31:54.315 --> 01:31:56.017
It's fine, no, it's fine.

1854
01:31:56.050 --> 01:31:58.853
- You don't need to say bye.
- I'll say bye, it's fine.

1855
01:31:58.886 --> 01:32:00.154
- Don't.
- It's fine, it's fine.

1856
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:04.692
We're leaving,
so I thought I'd say bye.

1857
01:32:04.725 --> 01:32:08.329
Cool. Wine.

1858
01:32:08.362 --> 01:32:09.764
Wow, that's good.

1859
01:32:09.797 --> 01:32:11.165
What is this?

1860
01:32:11.198 --> 01:32:13.601
Uh... Merlot.

1861
01:32:13.634 --> 01:32:15.336
That's much better
than the clearance bullshit

1862
01:32:15.369 --> 01:32:17.004
that we had on our first date.

1863
01:32:17.038 --> 01:32:18.906
You remember that, right?

1864
01:32:18.939 --> 01:32:20.674
Mmm.

1865
01:32:20.708 --> 01:32:22.643
Fucking delicious.

1866
01:32:22.676 --> 01:32:25.046
- Morgan...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1867
01:32:25.079 --> 01:32:27.648
Did you not tell her
that we used to date?

1868
01:32:27.681 --> 01:32:29.250
- We used to date.
- Yeah, I gathered.

1869
01:32:29.283 --> 01:32:31.685
Perceptive, I love it.

1870
01:32:31.719 --> 01:32:35.022
Lowick, man, he is
such the sweet guy.

1871
01:32:35.056 --> 01:32:36.891
Morgan, we should really go.

1872
01:32:36.924 --> 01:32:38.626
Yeah, definitely, definitely,
yeah, yeah.

1873
01:32:38.659 --> 01:32:40.995
I was just telling, um...

1874
01:32:41.028 --> 01:32:42.963
- Sarah.
- ...Sarah here

1875
01:32:42.997 --> 01:32:47.034
how lucky she is to be
with such a gosh-darn sweet guy.

1876
01:32:47.068 --> 01:32:49.003
You know what I like most
about him?

1877
01:32:49.036 --> 01:32:52.039
How much he values
total honesty.

1878
01:32:52.073 --> 01:32:54.341
- I told him I loved him...
- Um, Morgan, why don't we...

1879
01:32:54.375 --> 01:32:56.977
No, don't touch me!

1880
01:32:57.011 --> 01:32:58.279
This is a really great story.

1881
01:32:58.312 --> 01:33:00.081
After we said, "I love you,"

1882
01:33:00.114 --> 01:33:01.982
he found out
that I fucked for money,

1883
01:33:02.016 --> 01:33:03.751
and he kicked me
out of his house

1884
01:33:03.784 --> 01:33:05.820
in the middle of the night
and never returned

1885
01:33:05.853 --> 01:33:08.856
a single one
of my calls or texts.

1886
01:33:08.889 --> 01:33:11.325
Man, that is rich.

1887
01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:16.297
Still as funny
as the first time it happened.

1888
01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:17.865
Ooh.

1889
01:33:17.898 --> 01:33:19.400
I know that look.

1890
01:33:19.433 --> 01:33:21.702
That is a look of a person
finding out

1891
01:33:21.735 --> 01:33:23.304
for the very first time.

1892
01:33:23.337 --> 01:33:26.273
Did you not tell her that
you used to fuck a prostitute?

1893
01:33:26.307 --> 01:33:28.809
- Did he not tell you that?
- Hadn't gotten to that yet, no.

1894
01:33:28.843 --> 01:33:29.944
You're welcome.

1895
01:33:29.977 --> 01:33:34.248
I saved you one very awkward
conversation, my friend.

1896
01:33:34.281 --> 01:33:35.850
So please, Stacy...

1897
01:33:35.883 --> 01:33:39.253
- Sarah.
- Sarah, so close.

1898
01:33:39.286 --> 01:33:41.655
Don't worry,
I'm very much into health.

1899
01:33:41.689 --> 01:33:43.858
I got checked constantly,

1900
01:33:43.891 --> 01:33:46.127
especially after
we stopped using condoms.

1901
01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.328
Okay, Morgan.

1902
01:33:47.361 --> 01:33:48.462
I really think we should go.

1903
01:33:48.496 --> 01:33:51.065
Oh, I completely forgot
you guys were standing here.

1904
01:33:51.098 --> 01:33:53.968
Sarah, lovely to meet you.

1905
01:33:54.001 --> 01:33:56.103
Lowick...

1906
01:33:57.338 --> 01:33:59.874
I'm sorry.

1907
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:11.085
Morgan, can you just wait
a second?

1908
01:34:11.118 --> 01:34:12.686
I don't want to hear
about what I should

1909
01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.854
or should not have done.

1910
01:34:13.888 --> 01:34:15.055
I just needed to say that.

1911
01:34:15.089 --> 01:34:16.790
Why did you say all of that?

1912
01:34:16.824 --> 01:34:18.759
Can we not do this right now?

1913
01:34:18.792 --> 01:34:21.162
Sorry if I don't feel
like brushing all of that

1914
01:34:21.195 --> 01:34:25.065
under the rug
like it was nothing.

1915
01:34:25.099 --> 01:34:26.767
Did you know about this?

1916
01:34:31.739 --> 01:34:32.840
You're my best fucking friend.

1917
01:34:32.873 --> 01:34:34.341
- What were you thinking?
- Well, you're not exactly

1918
01:34:34.375 --> 01:34:36.310
the most open-minded person
that I know.

1919
01:34:36.343 --> 01:34:38.946
This is why I don't cheers
with water!

1920
01:34:38.979 --> 01:34:40.447
Casey!

1921
01:34:40.481 --> 01:34:43.350
Casey, Casey!

1922
01:34:43.384 --> 01:34:46.220
Dude, where are you going?

1923
01:34:46.253 --> 01:34:49.156
Far, far away!

1924
01:34:57.532 --> 01:34:58.799
Sage.

1925
01:34:58.832 --> 01:35:00.234
- What?
- Get up.

1926
01:35:00.267 --> 01:35:01.468
No.

1927
01:35:01.502 --> 01:35:03.370
The ground is disgusting.
Come on.

1928
01:35:03.404 --> 01:35:05.272
Whatever, we probably
already have hep C

1929
01:35:05.306 --> 01:35:07.308
from walking barefoot anyway,
so it doesn't matter.

1930
01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:11.445
I am way too tired for
this bullshit right now, okay?

1931
01:35:11.478 --> 01:35:13.814
I don't care, I'm protesting.

1932
01:35:13.847 --> 01:35:16.083
So, what, you're just gonna lay
on the ground all night?

1933
01:35:16.116 --> 01:35:18.385
If it means not walking
in awkward silence anymore,

1934
01:35:18.419 --> 01:35:20.154
yeah, absolutely.

1935
01:35:20.187 --> 01:35:22.256
You're probably laying
in dry pee.

1936
01:35:22.289 --> 01:35:24.258
At least it's not wet pee.

1937
01:35:26.293 --> 01:35:28.796
Casey!

1938
01:35:29.997 --> 01:35:32.299
If she's trying to kill herself
by running into traffic,

1939
01:35:32.333 --> 01:35:34.168
tell her none of that
sideswipe bullshit.

1940
01:35:34.201 --> 01:35:36.203
It has to be head-on.

1941
01:35:38.573 --> 01:35:40.874
Guys?

1942
01:35:40.908 --> 01:35:41.775
Oh, what the...

1943
01:35:41.809 --> 01:35:43.511
You're not supposed
to just leave me

1944
01:35:43.545 --> 01:35:46.447
in the middle of the street!

1945
01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:49.183
Casey!

1946
01:35:49.216 --> 01:35:50.818
Casey, stop!

1947
01:35:50.851 --> 01:35:53.320
Someone's gonna call
the cops on us.

1948
01:35:58.259 --> 01:36:00.027
Oh, Jesus.

1949
01:36:03.097 --> 01:36:07.101
Casey, we got kicked out
last time we did this.

1950
01:36:07.134 --> 01:36:08.936
How long you gonna
ignore me for?

1951
01:36:12.973 --> 01:36:15.376
You assholes know
this unlocks, right?

1952
01:36:15.409 --> 01:36:17.111
Why are you so far behind?

1953
01:36:17.144 --> 01:36:18.879
Oh, I don't know,
maybe because you left me

1954
01:36:18.912 --> 01:36:20.180
in the middle
of the freaking street.

1955
01:36:20.214 --> 01:36:21.215
I'm sorry.

1956
01:36:23.551 --> 01:36:25.219
No.

1957
01:36:25.252 --> 01:36:26.920
- Yes.
- No.

1958
01:36:39.133 --> 01:36:40.602
God, is it cold?

1959
01:36:40.635 --> 01:36:42.069
Come on, it's not bad.

1960
01:36:42.102 --> 01:36:43.237
I think I don't believe you.

1961
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:44.438
Oh, now it's cold.

1962
01:36:47.207 --> 01:36:48.842
Oh!

1963
01:36:48.876 --> 01:36:50.911
Eeh!

1964
01:36:50.944 --> 01:36:53.981
Why are you staring
at me like that?

1965
01:36:54.014 --> 01:36:57.217
I didn't do anything,
you should be mad at her!

1966
01:37:04.358 --> 01:37:06.093
Are you gonna get in?

1967
01:37:06.126 --> 01:37:08.530
- No.
- We're gonna peer-pressure you.

1968
01:37:08.563 --> 01:37:09.564
No.

1969
01:37:09.597 --> 01:37:11.365
Please.

1970
01:37:11.398 --> 01:37:13.233
- You have to.
- I don't want to.

1971
01:37:13.267 --> 01:37:15.035
But... but you have to.

1972
01:37:15.069 --> 01:37:17.504
- I really don't.
- Lovely in here.

1973
01:37:17.539 --> 01:37:19.039
I really fucking don't.

1974
01:37:19.073 --> 01:37:21.408
Do you wanna play colors?

1975
01:37:21.442 --> 01:37:23.377
I don't.

1976
01:37:23.410 --> 01:37:26.380
- You don't?
- No, I'm lazy.

1977
01:37:26.413 --> 01:37:27.948
Marco Polo?

1978
01:37:30.451 --> 01:37:32.319
Just get in the freaking pool!

1979
01:37:32.353 --> 01:37:33.954
Sharks?

1980
01:37:33.987 --> 01:37:35.122
What... what is that?

1981
01:37:35.155 --> 01:37:36.524
That's not even a game.

1982
01:37:36.558 --> 01:37:39.561
She's just naming
aquatic life now.

1983
01:37:39.594 --> 01:37:42.062
- Get in!
- Mermaids?

1984
01:37:42.096 --> 01:37:43.497
No, no, no!

1985
01:37:43.531 --> 01:37:45.933
Don't fucking touch me.

1986
01:37:45.966 --> 01:37:48.168
- Get in the pool.
- Fine.

1987
01:37:51.004 --> 01:37:54.441
She listens to me
if I just, like...

1988
01:37:54.475 --> 01:37:56.477
- Oh, do I?
- ...dagger her.

1989
01:37:56.511 --> 01:37:59.980
- It's nice, right?
- You are a liar.

1990
01:38:00.013 --> 01:38:02.116
I hate you.

1991
01:38:06.521 --> 01:38:08.523
You're being a baby.

1992
01:38:13.293 --> 01:38:15.963
Having so much fun tonight.

1993
01:38:15.996 --> 01:38:17.431
So...

1994
01:38:18.966 --> 01:38:21.435
So, guys, I found out

1995
01:38:21.468 --> 01:38:24.271
that I'm manic depressive,
by the way.

1996
01:38:28.543 --> 01:38:31.713
- Wait, what?
- Excuse me?

1997
01:38:31.746 --> 01:38:34.047
Yeah.

1998
01:38:34.081 --> 01:38:39.521
I got the official word,
like, six months ago.

1999
01:38:39.554 --> 01:38:43.257
So, I know why
you didn't tell me.

2000
01:38:43.290 --> 01:38:44.626
I get it.

2001
01:38:44.659 --> 01:38:47.695
Wait, so you have
a legal mental illness?

2002
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:50.998
Apparently.

2003
01:38:51.031 --> 01:38:52.667
Does that come
with a handicap placard?

2004
01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:54.569
'Cause that could really benefit
all of us.

2005
01:38:56.003 --> 01:38:58.405
Just thinking
about the parking situation.

2006
01:38:58.439 --> 01:39:00.642
- Too soon.
- I'm thinking ahead!

2007
01:39:00.675 --> 01:39:03.010
- A bit funny.
- Planning for the future.

2008
01:39:03.043 --> 01:39:05.279
- I'm kidding!
- Help me.

2009
01:39:05.312 --> 01:39:06.714
Come here.

2010
01:39:13.688 --> 01:39:15.255
Help me, I'm bored.

2011
01:39:17.357 --> 01:39:19.193
Just roll it!

2012
01:39:19.226 --> 01:39:21.061
Okay.

2013
01:39:24.298 --> 01:39:26.734
Un-fucking-believable.

2014
01:39:26.768 --> 01:39:28.570
Can we not learn
to play another game?

2015
01:39:28.603 --> 01:39:30.370
- No.
- No.

2016
01:39:30.404 --> 01:39:32.039
Here you go, congratulations.

2017
01:39:32.072 --> 01:39:33.541
No!

2018
01:39:33.575 --> 01:39:35.042
It's olive juice, okay?

2019
01:39:35.075 --> 01:39:36.611
Your sobriety is safe,
I promise.

2020
01:39:36.644 --> 01:39:37.779
Okay, fine.

2021
01:39:41.181 --> 01:39:42.382
You disgrace me.

2022
01:39:44.786 --> 01:39:47.622
I have something to show you,
I totally forgot.

2023
01:39:50.290 --> 01:39:52.760
What is this?

2024
01:39:54.562 --> 01:39:55.395
Hmm.

2025
01:39:55.429 --> 01:39:58.265
"In the event
I never see you again,

2026
01:39:58.298 --> 01:40:01.669
it was a real displeasure
working with you.

2027
01:40:01.703 --> 01:40:04.672
When your book sells out
at Urban Outfitters,

2028
01:40:04.706 --> 01:40:06.808
I'm gonna gloat
about knowing you

2029
01:40:06.841 --> 01:40:11.245
back when you were
a super bitchy barista.

2030
01:40:11.278 --> 01:40:15.517
And I definitely won't think
of you when I jack off anymore."

2031
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:17.519
- That's so cute!
- That's disgusting.

2032
01:40:17.552 --> 01:40:18.520
I think it's funny.

2033
01:40:18.553 --> 01:40:19.386
- It is.
- Thank you.

2034
01:40:19.419 --> 01:40:23.090
"Best of luck
in this shitty world.

2035
01:40:23.123 --> 01:40:25.058
Kyle."

2036
01:40:26.661 --> 01:40:29.831
"In case you ever... lover..."

2037
01:40:29.864 --> 01:40:31.298
- Lower.
- "Lower."

2038
01:40:31.331 --> 01:40:33.467
- Lower.
- His handwriting is very shitty.

2039
01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:36.436
"...your standards,
you know where to find me.

2040
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:38.171
Let's fuck each other up."

2041
01:40:38.205 --> 01:40:39.807
Oh my God, I love him.

2042
01:40:39.841 --> 01:40:41.408
- Really?
- Yeah.

2043
01:40:41.441 --> 01:40:42.744
He's a weirdo.

2044
01:40:42.777 --> 01:40:44.612
Wait, you're not actually
gonna call him.

2045
01:40:44.646 --> 01:40:46.848
He is so greasy, Sage.

2046
01:40:46.881 --> 01:40:48.716
Of course she's gonna call him.

2047
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:50.685
Weirdos do all
the fun, kinky shit.

2048
01:40:51.719 --> 01:40:53.320
Do you think his cum is greasy?

2049
01:40:53.353 --> 01:40:55.523
Okay, I am not...
not at that level yet.

2050
01:40:55.557 --> 01:40:57.257
Grease jizz!

2051
01:40:57.291 --> 01:40:58.726
Yes!

2052
01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.327
New addition to the team.

2053
01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:01.461
He's not greasy!

2054
01:41:01.495 --> 01:41:04.866
Why do you guys always have
to circle back to jizz?

2055
01:41:04.899 --> 01:41:07.434
- Why not? Why should we not?
- Anything else.

2056
01:41:07.467 --> 01:41:09.202
- Why is she shushing us?
- I don't know.

2057
01:41:09.236 --> 01:41:10.838
- You're judging me.
- Is Kyle, like, outside?

2058
01:41:10.872 --> 01:41:14.308
- Of course I'm judging you.
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.

2059
01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:21.348
I don't want your jizz
grease breath on me!

2060
01:41:21.381 --> 01:41:23.685
Ew, why am I talking
about jizz now?

2061
01:41:23.718 --> 01:41:26.721
- You guys have changed me.
- You're corrupted!

2062
01:41:26.754 --> 01:41:28.255
I'm sorry, honey.

2063
01:41:32.459 --> 01:41:34.494
You scared the shit out...

2064
01:41:34.529 --> 01:41:36.229
You bitch!

2065
01:41:37.899 --> 01:41:39.499
Got 'em.

2066
01:41:39.534 --> 01:41:41.569
Yeah, you did.

2067
01:41:41.603 --> 01:41:44.171
When was the last time
you shaved your legs?

2068
01:41:44.204 --> 01:41:45.472
Give me your hand.

2069
01:41:48.208 --> 01:41:52.312
I like Kyle now, he loves
our girl for who she is.

2070
01:41:52.346 --> 01:41:54.281
Even with hairy legs.

2071
01:41:55.917 --> 01:41:58.620
I'm leaving you, I'm going pee.
I'm done with you guys.

2072
01:41:58.653 --> 01:42:00.454
- Go pee.
- Okay, bye.

2073
01:42:00.487 --> 01:42:03.357
- Yeah, I'm leaving.
- Love you, mean it.

2074
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:05.492
I hope you enjoy
your life without me,

2075
01:42:05.526 --> 01:42:07.394
'cause it's gonna be
a long one.

2076
01:42:07.427 --> 01:42:09.429
- Sagey.
- A very long life.

2077
01:42:09.463 --> 01:42:10.898
Okay, wait, don't leave us.

2078
01:42:10.932 --> 01:42:12.767
We're a lesbian tribe!

2079
01:42:14.669 --> 01:42:17.772
- It's too late, I'm gone.
- Okay, bye then.

2080
01:42:17.805 --> 01:42:19.339
I'm dead and I'm dying.

2081
01:42:19.373 --> 01:42:21.274
We'll survive without you.

2082
01:42:21.308 --> 01:42:23.711
- No, we won't, actually.
- No?

2083
