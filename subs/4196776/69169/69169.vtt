2
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Prepare thyself for one twisted tale.

3
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,440
Through the chapters of time,
legends have been told

4
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,760
of brave knights, evil warlocks,

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,920
beautiful maidens, magical prophecies,

6
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,520
and other serious shit.

7
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,840
Be not afraid.

8
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,400
This is your destiny.

9
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,800
You will bear my seed,

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,200
giving birth to a new beast,

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,960
a new age:

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,280
An age where I will
command mankind in fear!

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,400
To arms!

14
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,080
At ease, Maiden.

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
When the light of the world flickers,

16
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,600
we, the Golden Order of Knights,

17
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,560
restore the rule of good.

18
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,280
You're safe now.

19
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,880
Then let us pray

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,080
that 100 years from now
when these two moons meet again,

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,720
there will be a hero
as brave as you, my lord.

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,000
A hero as brave.

23
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,480
Oh, fuck me.

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,240
Prince Thadeous of Mourne,

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,920
you are hereby sentenced to death
by hanging

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,480
for your illicit behavior

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,000
with the noble Dwarf King's
second wife Regina.

28
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,520
You're a disgrace to any kingdom!

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,920
I say hang the bastard.

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,320
Get on with it!

31
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,080
And your minstrel, Courtney,

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,840
is to be tarred and feathered

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,800
for unlawful association
with a deviant.

34
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,520
Children, I'm allergic,
please. Let's not.

35
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,960
Please! These allegations,
they're being greatly exaggerated.

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,880
It was more or less
just heavy petting

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,320
with a brief moment of penetration.

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,280
Disgusting!

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
He deserves to die! Kill him!
Hang the bastard!

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Hey! Easy! That's not nice.

41
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,360
You, bloodthirsty little fucker!

42
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,080
Show me some respect, I'm a prince!

43
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
To the bowels of hell!

44
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,440
Good night, Prince.

45
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,680
Oh, dear gods.

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,280
Your Highness, what are you doing?

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,480
I'm escaping, Courtney!

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,400
Quit playing with those children
and help me!

49
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,240
Kill him!

50
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,600
Get him! After him!

51
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,680
Your Highness, wait for me!

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,680
Why are they upset?

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,680
All dwarf queens are unfaithful.

54
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,400
Hurry, Courtney, back to the kingdom!

55
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,560
Forgive us with your tiny hearts!

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,160
Faster sheepies, faster!

57
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,920
Please wait, sir!

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,360
Courtney, you've proven
yourself useless yet again.

59
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,720
Who's that?

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,960
We're safe and we're stoned.

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,040
Ganja!

62
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,240
They're gaining on us.

63
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Oh, the dragon!

64
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,120
Those Highland Dwarves have got weapons!

65
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Coming through.

66
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Boobies!

67
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,200
Watch out, Courtney!

68
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,480
I'm telling father we should go

69
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
to war with these double-crossers.

70
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,880
Poultry!

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,280
Livestock! Courtney,
this is no time to be napping.

72
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,680
I'm a chicken.

73
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,640
Let's get back... Oh, look!

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,960
A little feast to
break up this pursuit.

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,280
Dangerous, yet delicious.

76
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm jumping out this window.

77
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,560
He's angry!

78
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,040
Courtney, break my fall with your body.

79
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,440
Please don't hurt my bottom!

80
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,640
Run, Courtney! Pick up the pace!

81
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,800
Why do people so little run so fast?

82
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,960
That was close.

83
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,320
Courtney, I've had enough
of this nonsense!

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
Crack-a-lacka, you little varmint.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,640
They're devils, sir! They're devils!

86
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,600
- Get him!
- They're muscular.

87
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,640
- Get off me!
- That's it, sir!

88
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,960
Your Highness!

89
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,840
Please tell me that you
completed your simple task

90
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,560
and secured the treaty
signed by the Lord of the Dwarf Village.

91
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,360
Father, they sent a beautiful woman
to distract me and I was defenseless.

92
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,560
Don't bandy words with me,
Thadeous.

93
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,160
Your brother is to return
from his quest at any moment.

94
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,360
Please go and bathe yourself.

95
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,200
Why must I bow to greet him?

96
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,840
No one does anything special for me
when I do extraordinary things.

97
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,080
And what extraordinary things
have you done of late?

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,160
Do tell me. Enlighten me.

99
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,960
Courtney, what extraordinary things
have I done?

100
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,600
You took a bubble bath,
ate some toast,

101
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,240
had a sleep for one hour,

102
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,640
and commissioned a naked statue
of your fine self.

103
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,520
God, if your mother
could see you now.

104
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,840
Hear ye! Hear ye!

105
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,600
Oh, dear gods.

106
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,480
It is with blossoming personal joy

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,440
that I announce the return
of the mighty,

108
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,880
the magnificent, the merciful,

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
Prince Fabious!

110
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,200
Hey, Prince Fabious,
we adore you!

111
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,720
Welcome home, Prince Fabious.

112
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,000
You're my king, Prince Fabious.

113
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,160
Welcome home! You are adored.

114
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,080
It's Prince Fabious!

115
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,560
Prince Fabious,
I'm here for you now.

116
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,200
Brother!

117
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,520
Oh, my god, I missed you so.

118
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,960
Great to see you.

119
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,440
Father.

120
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,400
My son.

121
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
Welcome home.

122
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,160
As you all know,

123
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,520
the evil wizard Leezar
has plagued our kingdom

124
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,600
with his foul creatures
and wicked ways for years.

125
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,280
But with my brave trusted knights

126
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,120
and my dear Simon.

127
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,520
Join us, my mechanical friend.

128
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,040
We have dispatched the latest
of these cold blooded enemies.

129
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
Behold!

130
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,320
The head of Leezar's mighty Cyclops!

131
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,840
Fuck, yeah!

132
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,160
Fabious! Fabious! Fabious!

133
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,480
Once again, Prince Fabious has made me
as proud as a father could ever be.

134
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,680
All the land owes him gratitude.

135
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,440
This is not the only good news

136
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,760
that I've brought home with me today.

137
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,440
Father, brother, kingdom...

138
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,520
She is radiant!

139
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,000
I'd like you
to meet my bride-to-be.

140
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,280
Belladonna.

141
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,360
Belladonna, my dear,

142
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,840
why don't you delight us
with your story.

143
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,880
Oh, no.
It's a story of strife and sadness.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,040
No, no, it's not.
It's a story of love.

145
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,240
You don't have to tell it.

146
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,440
If she doesn't want to tell it.

147
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,360
She will tell.
This is a table full of your loved ones.

148
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,320
Okay.

149
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,080
I've been held captive by Leezar

150
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,800
in the Tower of Disorder
since I was but a child.

151
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,519
Never knowing love nor human contact.

152
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,119
But I never gave up hope.

153
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:01,759
Singing every day, praying
that someday my hero would find me.

154
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,359
And I did.

155
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,759
We had just slaughtered the Cyclops.

156
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,479
We were on our way home, and on the wind

157
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,119
I heard the most beautiful song.

158
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,399
Fascinating, really.
May we take pause for one moment.

159
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,479
Yes, sir.

160
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:17,799
Look at Courtney's new haircut.

161
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,399
Doesn't it make his head
look like the tip of a penis?

162
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,399
It's hilarious.

163
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,759
Thadeous, please.

164
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,199
What is your problem?

165
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,959
You, Fabious,
you're being selfish and greedy.

166
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,759
Stealing all the attentions.

167
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,439
Today is not just for you two.

168
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,759
Today is Thundarian's birthday.

169
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,439
Thundarian, is it your birthday?

170
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,799
It's not my birthday.

171
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,559
It's not Thundarian's
birthday, Thadeous.

172
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,759
Enough, enough.

173
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,399
My heart's desire, what is this?

174
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,279
No. That's a...
We call that a fork,

175
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,359
and you use that for your food.

176
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,639
Right there. Fucking idiot.

177
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,279
Having spent years in the tower

178
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,039
has made her ignorant to some of
our customs and things in general.

179
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,159
Why, yes, of course.

180
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,359
If your mother were here today,

181
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,719
she would be a very proud woman,
Fabious.

182
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,039
Thank you, Father.

183
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,759
Which is why I ask your permission
to marry her at once.

184
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,839
The glory of romance!

185
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,839
I call upon my criers to proclaim

186
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,559
that tomorrow we'll see the greatest
wedding this kingdom has ever known.

187
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,479
And tonight, we celebrate!

188
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:31,839
I don't like this.

189
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,399
Courtney, will you make funny faces
to entertain me?

190
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,879
No.

191
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:43,079
Never triangle face.
I hate triangle face. It scares me.

192
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,959
Apologies.

193
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,599
Good evening, Your Royal Highness.

194
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:49,759
Julie.

195
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,719
Hello, fucking Julie.

196
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,599
What a wonderful,
wonderful evening, sire.

197
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:58,119
Yet another glorious achievement

198
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:02,359
in the whole firmament of starring
moments for your brother Fabious.

199
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:07,239
We shall remember it
for the rest of our lives.

200
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,439
Isn't that amazing how he can talk

201
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,319
and suck my cock
at the same exact time?

202
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,599
Yes, it is. Incredible.

203
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:17,319
Oh, clean yourself up.

204
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:19,119
Should have closed your eyes, Julie.

205
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:22,079
I know your vulgarity
masks your pain.

206
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:23,399
No, it doesn't.

207
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,639
I was trying to remember
the last time we had

208
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,599
one of these wonderful
evenings for you, sir.

209
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:30,759
Surely there must have been one

210
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,839
somewhere in the history of this
kingdom, of your illustrious life.

211
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,479
There must've been some moment

212
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:39,079
that we can all remember.

213
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:41,639
And I'm trying to think now

214
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,959
and there's nothing.

215
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,199
Courtney, I think I've had enough
of this foul party.

216
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:49,079
Yes, sir.

217
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:53,919
Stupid Julie, I'll show him.

218
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:56,039
I am Thadeous,

219
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,639
the greatest sword fighting man
to ever live.

220
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,239
I will murder anyone
whoever tries to insult me

221
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,799
or challenge me.

222
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:10,799
Some balls you have, Simon,
showing yourself to me.

223
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,959
No matter what you say,
we'll never be friends

224
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,519
because I hate mechanical inventions
and you know this.

225
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,879
Wipe that smile off your face.

226
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,799
Hey, Simon.

227
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,919
You should swing from your hips,
brother. You'll get more leverage.

228
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,959
Here, let me show you.

229
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:30,119
Oh, god.

230
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,839
Put your hands there, yeah,

231
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,039
and swing.

232
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:38,279
Gods, get off of me.
I know how to use a sword.

233
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,199
- Do you?
- Yes.

234
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,279
We'll see about that.

235
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,039
Okay, enough.
I don't want to do swords with you.

236
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,159
I'm doing it by myself.

237
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,599
Defend yourself, brother!

238
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,039
- Stop it.
- There you go.

239
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,079
Stop.

240
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:50,679
Defend yourself!

241
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,519
Stop it.

242
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,919
Oh, shit!

243
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,759
You just nicked my knuckles!

244
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,719
Oh, you'll be all right. It's not
as if I cut your head off or anything.

245
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,879
Why would you bring
that disgusting thing here?

246
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:04,039
It's getting juices
in our water supply.

247
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,879
It's a souvenir of my kill.

248
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:08,599
I always take one
from a foe that's tasted the cold,

249
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:11,199
unrelenting steel of my blade.

250
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:13,119
Souvenir of your kill?

251
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:17,759
That sounds like a rather stupid,
bloodthirsty tradition.

252
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,679
What's your problem?

253
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,159
Why are you such a sourpuss?

254
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,839
I'm not being a sourpuss. I just
didn't wanna be at that celebrations.

255
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,119
All I want is for you
to be a part of this moment.

256
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:29,639
I want you to be gay
with me and father.

257
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,599
I don't want to be gay
with you two.

258
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,079
I'd rather just stay in here

259
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:36,679
with my blade and fuck things up.

260
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,919
Why would you say that?

261
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,239
Because, Fabious, it's true.

262
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,799
I'm sick and tired
of everyone sucking up on your tits

263
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,839
because you are to become king.

264
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,319
All the while, no one gives
two turtle shits about me.

265
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,639
But Thaddy,
first borns like me, we become king.

266
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,999
Second borns, you can be
whatever you want to be.

267
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,639
I want to be king.

268
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,319
Maybe we can both be king.

269
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:07,839
No, I want to be king by myself.

270
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,719
Well, cheer up, brother.

271
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,559
I have something else
that you can be.

272
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,159
What?

273
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,239
Best man at my wedding.

274
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:18,519
I can think of no one else
I'd want by my side

275
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,159
as I sing my vow passionately
into her eyes.

276
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,719
Sounds tedious and boring.

277
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,359
If I'm not mistaken,
it's tradition

278
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:28,239
that the best man gets
to finger the bridesmaids.

279
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:31,839
Really? I've never heard
of this tradition.

280
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,839
You have a fucking deal.

281
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,079
Oh, you're gonna be so handsome!

282
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,239
Who's gonna be
the most handsome best man?

283
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:43,479
Probably me.

284
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:46,919
Who's the prince
with the most dashing moustache?

285
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,079
Me.

286
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:50,359
Who gives the warmest hugs?

287
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,279
Me, of course.

288
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,679
I love you, Thadeous.

289
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,239
Okay, that's cool.

290
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:02,359
All gather
for the royal wedding!

291
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:17,559
Hello there, best man.

292
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,599
Best man?

293
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:21,479
If he wanted a best man,
he should have chosen me.

294
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,519
How many quests
have I been on with Fabious?

295
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,239
Countless.

296
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:28,439
I gave my hand to save his life
on the battlefield.

297
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,439
And yet he chooses Thadeous
as his best man.

298
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,959
That sorry sack of shit.

299
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:37,799
Such a poor excuse for a prince.

300
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,559
He's nothing more than a self-entitled,
rotten child!

301
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,439
Idiot.

302
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,639
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

303
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,319
Belladonna...

304
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:51,159
Oh, my love.

305
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:56,399
Oh, Fabious, I can't wait
until the cervix is over,

306
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,879
and to lie together as one:

307
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,199
No, the service.

308
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:05,359
The cervix is a circular wing
of muscles that contracts or expands.

309
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:07,239
It's up in your vagina.

310
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:10,599
That's where my penis will go
after the wedding.

311
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,519
Have you not consummated your love?

312
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,839
Not yet.

313
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,559
Belladonna has never been with a man

314
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,239
so we've decided to preserve her purity
till after the wedding.

315
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,879
She's given me this ribbon
from her fair hair.

316
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:26,279
To hold on to until
we can be together in a sex-way.

317
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,559
Yes.

318
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,879
Enough, enough.

319
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:33,799
If Thadeous wishes to play forgetful

320
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,319
on his brother's day of days,

321
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,079
then wait we shall not.

322
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,559
I can't get married
without my brother. He's my best man.

323
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:43,639
His time has passed.
Pick another best man.

324
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,719
No.

325
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,639
- Julie, you be best man.
- Here you are.

326
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,599
Godsdammit.

327
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,039
Oh, Brendan,
you trolls have it so easy.

328
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,479
Out here playing recklessly
in your beautiful mud.

329
00:15:57,599 --> 00:16:01,439
Eating your scraps
of horse meats and crumbs.

330
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,639
- Green grass.
- Green grass.

331
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,639
And do tell, how do you get so dirty?

332
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,679
You just take the earth
and rub it upon your face?

333
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,879
Your Highness,

334
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,319
the wedding has... Hello.
The wedding has started.

335
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,559
I do not care.

336
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,919
I'd rather stay with
this fine gentleman.

337
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,079
Hiding here with my true friends.

338
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,199
Yes.

339
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:28,079
Let the whole entire wedding wonder
and worry where I am.

340
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:35,879
This is the day
that I've been waiting for

341
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:40,239
Sand in the kingdom

342
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:43,759
Our love is born

343
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:49,999
Flowing from the ocean to the moons

344
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,919
Your heart now I hold

345
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:04,759
You have a beauty I can't ignore

346
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:11,319
Bastion of all I do adore

347
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,959
Giving this moment

348
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,359
Our love that's true

349
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:26,119
Our hearts now are one

350
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,759
Bravo!

351
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,639
Bravo!

352
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,079
Bravo!

353
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:38,799
Reveal yourself, stranger.
Are you lost?

354
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,759
A thousand pardons. I mean not
to intrude on such a joyous occasion.

355
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:47,319
However, today I just
could not help myself.

356
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,439
Leezar!

357
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,319
You're not welcome here, devil!

358
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,799
If you come in peace, say so,

359
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,039
otherwise prepare to meet your doom.

360
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:00,119
Oh, brave Fabious.

361
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:04,679
You murdered my Cyclops. But I have
other perils in store for you.

362
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,439
Ones that are beyond
the bounds of your imagination.

363
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,919
One, in particular,

364
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,679
involving an ancient prophecy destined

365
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,239
to be fulfilled by a powerful warlock,

366
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,559
me:

367
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,719
And, of course, a very beautiful virgin
that looks just like

368
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:21,359
her.

369
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:25,119
I was keeping that one
for something very special.

370
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:28,719
And I dare say it was rude of you
to steal her from me.

371
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,199
Now I'm here to get her back.

372
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,759
And just how do you plan
on doing that?

373
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,719
Magic,

374
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:36,519
motherfucker.

375
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:37,599
Not a moment more.

376
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:40,399
- Knights, to arms!
- Take him!

377
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,119
Do you honestly think
your band of worms can stop me?

378
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,919
Arise therefore, my mothers!

379
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:03,159
Watch out!

380
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,679
Come with me.

381
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,439
Leezar!

382
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,319
I shall not go back
to that dreadful tower!

383
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,719
Look into my eyes!

384
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,199
You will learn to love me!
Do you understand?

385
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,079
Come on.

386
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,599
Impossible.

387
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,319
Farewell, Kingdom of Mourne.

388
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:14,719
As always, it has been my pleasure.

389
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,479
I thought
it was from riding sheep,

390
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,039
but it turns out just
to be an ear infection.

391
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,199
You fucker!

392
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,119
Good times.

393
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,799
No one get up. I'm very tired.

394
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:42,639
I'm going straight
to my bed chambers.

395
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,879
Brother, thank god you're alive.

396
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:47,399
When you didn't show up
for the wedding, I feared the worst.

397
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:48,719
Why are you crying?

398
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,479
Leezar has taken my love.

399
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,719
- What?
- Yes.

400
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,279
So, your brother is
about to embark on yet another quest.

401
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:56,879
This time to rescue Belladonna

402
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:58,919
and rid the land of
that loathsome wretch

403
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,119
once and for all.

404
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,479
How noble of him.

405
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,719
Well, it was nice to see you,
as short as the visit was.

406
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,439
I look forward to hearing about it.
Good luck and good bye.

407
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,879
Thadeous,
this is Fabious' 28th quest.

408
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:14,439
How many have you been on?

409
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,879
Courtney,
how many quests have I completed?

410
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,719
The answer is none.

411
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:23,319
It is finally time
for you to become a man.

412
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:26,359
You must journey with your brother
to rescue his bride.

413
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:28,079
Father, you can't be serious.

414
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,319
If you want me to go
on to a quest,

415
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:30,719
then let's start
with something easy,

416
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:33,919
like boiling a chicken
or beating off in front of a Pegasus.

417
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,639
Elementary things.

418
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,359
Look around you at the harm
that has befallen this castle!

419
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,839
This quest is your last chance

420
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,279
to prove to me and the kingdom

421
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:49,319
that you are a man worthy
to bear the family crest,

422
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:52,839
and to show that at your core,
you are not rotten,

423
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:56,159
but you are brave,
and honorable, and noble.

424
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:58,959
All the qualities
expected of a prince.

425
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,519
The choice is yours.

426
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:03,079
Either journey with your brother
and the Knights Elite,

427
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:06,479
or you can face banishment
from the kingdom.

428
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,399
Shit.

429
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:33,879
You see, Courtney,

430
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:37,159
I alone understand how
to properly prepare for a quest.

431
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,159
Masculine garments,
proper, good collie to smoke upon.

432
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,919
How is Steven doing?

433
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,839
He looks like he's stoned, sir.

434
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,159
Fabious has Simon,

435
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:49,639
and now I have Steven,
a far superior creature companion.

436
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,079
Wouldn't you agree?

437
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:53,719
He will fare very well, indeed,
I'm sure, Your Highness.

438
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,519
I do hope this adventure
is not too stressful or boring.

439
00:22:56,639 --> 00:23:01,599
Either way I intend to get properly
fucked up if no one disagrees.

440
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:19,919
Belladonna, wake up. Wake up.

441
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,959
Who is that? Where am I?

442
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,679
'Tis I, Fabious. Your love.

443
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,479
Fabious?

444
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,239
You're still in Leezar's lair.

445
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,919
But fear not,
I'm here to rescue you.

446
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,839
Fabious, it's really you.

447
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:35,719
I knew you'd come to find me.

448
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,439
I can't do this. I can't do it.
It's so mean.

449
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,838
You should've seen
the look on your face. It's me!

450
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,518
You're still a prisoner.

451
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,158
I've seen a beautiful world
beyond this prison,

452
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:56,558
and I count the hours
till I escape.

453
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:58,438
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

454
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,718
Lookie there.
The twin moons drawing slowly together.

455
00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:05,278
Time moving them closer.

456
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:09,278
Just as time moves you
and I closer together.

457
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:12,678
And when the two moons unite,
so shall we.

458
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,158
Perhaps, keeping you
in this tower has left you ignorant.

459
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:18,758
You're so easily deceived.

460
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:22,758
For example, I have heard
that your Prince Fabious

461
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,678
has made his bed recklessly
with many maidens.

462
00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:32,478
And I heard that he has fungi
on his genitalia as a result.

463
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:35,078
Also, he organizes orgies

464
00:24:35,198 --> 00:24:37,798
with wenches and barbarians alike

465
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:42,438
and he takes sperm on him
and gives it to women freely.

466
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:44,478
Spilling his seed willy-nilly

467
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:47,758
as he makes his way through that orgy.

468
00:24:47,878 --> 00:24:49,798
I don't believe you.

469
00:24:49,918 --> 00:24:53,838
He is not the dashing young man
you believe him to be.

470
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,718
So...

471
00:24:56,638 --> 00:25:01,238
these are the harsh realities
of the outside world.

472
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:04,678
Welcome home.

473
00:25:06,598 --> 00:25:09,638
Halt! Steady.

474
00:25:13,318 --> 00:25:15,358
Sorry to disturb you two
love birds

475
00:25:15,478 --> 00:25:18,198
but we've arrived
at the home of the Wize Wizard.

476
00:25:18,318 --> 00:25:19,878
Who the hell is the Wize Wizard?

477
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:21,678
He's an ancient seer who helps many

478
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:23,478
on their quest with added insight.

479
00:25:23,598 --> 00:25:26,518
Great.
Well, let me know how it goes.

480
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:28,478
Leave him in his carriage, Fabious.

481
00:25:28,598 --> 00:25:30,718
You and I will seek counsel
with the Wize Wizard.

482
00:25:30,838 --> 00:25:31,798
No.

483
00:25:31,918 --> 00:25:35,038
Come, brother. This is the first stop
on your first quest.

484
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,398
We shall go together.

485
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:49,998
Brother,

486
00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:51,638
you look ravishing in that armor,

487
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,878
but I don't think you'll need it.

488
00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:57,438
The Wize Wizard is a peaceful,
little old man.

489
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,598
I'm wearing it.
You're just being jealous.

490
00:25:59,718 --> 00:26:00,638
Shit!

491
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:02,518
Thadeous!

492
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:05,558
Fuck.

493
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:09,598
Hello? Anyone home?

494
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:14,318
Looks as if someone is
cultivating glorious herbs in here.

495
00:26:14,438 --> 00:26:16,478
Hey, Wize Wizard,
is that you over there?

496
00:26:16,598 --> 00:26:20,518
Who dares enter my den?

497
00:26:20,638 --> 00:26:24,158
It is I, Prince Fabious
and my brother, Prince Thadeous.

498
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:26,078
We come to seek counsel.

499
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:29,318
Come, come. Give me kisses.

500
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,318
Kiss him.

501
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:39,358
Fuck, no.

502
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:40,398
Pretty please.

503
00:26:40,518 --> 00:26:42,118
Kiss it on the mouth.

504
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:44,158
For the quest.

505
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:47,278
I do it every time I come.

506
00:26:48,998 --> 00:26:52,798
Hello. Nice to meet you.

507
00:26:54,998 --> 00:26:56,478
Oh, god.

508
00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:57,958
Sit, sit.

509
00:26:58,078 --> 00:26:59,078
Sit.

510
00:26:59,198 --> 00:27:03,078
Fabious has been coming here
since he was a boy.

511
00:27:03,198 --> 00:27:05,158
You did this
when you were a child.

512
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:06,438
Yes!

513
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,358
We had great times, didn't we?

514
00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:11,198
Yes, yes, we did.

515
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:14,038
You would kiss him?

516
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:17,438
Yeah, sometimes we
would do other things.

517
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:19,238
Like what?

518
00:27:19,358 --> 00:27:22,358
When I was younger, we'd take
our shirts off and jump on the bed.

519
00:27:22,478 --> 00:27:25,638
Playful secrets.

520
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:27,518
Don't tell father.

521
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:30,078
Breathe deeply of these herbs

522
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:31,878
and share a vision with me.

523
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:33,838
Of course.

524
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:41,558
Yes. Allow me to puff as well.

525
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:47,518
Those are some powerful herbs.

526
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:49,638
Giving me dark visions.

527
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:51,198
Shall we pack this again?

528
00:27:51,318 --> 00:27:54,518
I'm not getting visions.
I'm not sure if it's working, Wizard.

529
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:57,278
Visions. Visions.

530
00:27:57,398 --> 00:27:59,638
Thadeous,
are you seeing what I'm seeing?

531
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:00,878
You making a fool yourself.

532
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:02,398
Handle your shit, Fabious, please.

533
00:28:02,518 --> 00:28:04,438
No, I can't.

534
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:07,198
Please, interpret these visions, Wizard.

535
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:10,278
Prophecies foretell of an evil wizard

536
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,878
laying his seed inside a virgin

537
00:28:12,998 --> 00:28:15,398
under the eclipse of the two moons.

538
00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:17,918
What? What evil prophecy is this?

539
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:19,398
The child she would spawn

540
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:22,118
is said to be
a dragon most powerful.

541
00:28:22,238 --> 00:28:26,118
Leezar wants to make love
to Belladonna to create a dragon?

542
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,238
That's fucking disgusting.

543
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:29,758
I cannot let this happen.

544
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:30,918
When is this eclipse?

545
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:32,838
In five nights' time,

546
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:36,798
but you will need an enchanted blade
to do this warlock in.

547
00:28:36,918 --> 00:28:39,598
A blade made of unicorn horn.

548
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,438
Say where I can find such a sword
and it shall be mine.

549
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,478
It rests in the depths
of the most perilous hidden labyrinth.

550
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:48,998
Just beyond Muldiss Darton.

551
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:50,238
Muldiss Darton.

552
00:28:50,358 --> 00:28:52,798
Well, what is Muldiss Darton?

553
00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:55,318
It's a place of legend.

554
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:03,598
Powerful magic.

555
00:29:03,718 --> 00:29:06,278
This crooked compass
will catch the light

556
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,478
and point the way to
the labyrinth's location.

557
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:10,798
Be warned,

558
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:14,758
they say the walls of this maze
drive men to madness.

559
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,918
But if you can find your way,

560
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,038
the blade will be yours.

561
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:22,118
Thank you, Wize Wizard.

562
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:25,518
Not so fast. First you
must answer a riddle.

563
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:30,438
What journey be long and twisted
and sensitive at hand?

564
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,558
To what end must man go
to discover the depths of his ecstasy?

565
00:29:35,678 --> 00:29:38,598
Think hard, strong warriors.

566
00:29:38,718 --> 00:29:40,878
Fuck, I know this.

567
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,598
I've got it!

568
00:29:42,718 --> 00:29:47,398
You want us to twist what is long
with our sensitive hands.

569
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:49,238
He wants us to jerk him off.

570
00:29:49,358 --> 00:29:51,758
Just punch the tip and twist it.

571
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:55,278
Yes, but we are not
going to do that.

572
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:59,158
If it's for the quest,
we will do what needs to be done.

573
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:04,238
I'll work the tip,
you tickle his balls.

574
00:30:11,318 --> 00:30:13,478
- Pervert.
- Did you get any information?

575
00:30:13,598 --> 00:30:15,518
Let's just make camp.

576
00:30:15,638 --> 00:30:19,278
Sick. This quest sucks.

577
00:30:19,438 --> 00:30:20,758
It used to be you that joined him.

578
00:30:20,878 --> 00:30:22,798
Yes.

579
00:30:23,878 --> 00:30:27,558
Don't worry. All will be well.

580
00:30:35,678 --> 00:30:38,158
Attentions please, warriors.

581
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:39,918
I propose a toast.

582
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,598
Let us drink till
thine asses are drunk.

583
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:44,518
Brother, we do not celebrate

584
00:30:44,638 --> 00:30:46,318
until we complete the quest at hand.

585
00:30:46,438 --> 00:30:47,958
It is the code of the Knights Elite.

586
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:51,158
What of my code
where we drink like men?

587
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:54,958
Thadeous, we have some traditions
of our own out here on the road.

588
00:30:55,078 --> 00:30:57,918
Manious, prepare the warrior's tidings,
if you will.

589
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:02,918
If it is the first night
of your first quest, well...

590
00:31:07,238 --> 00:31:08,998
Here it comes.

591
00:31:09,478 --> 00:31:11,718
Disgusting.

592
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:14,638
Feast upon the heart of the beast.

593
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:16,278
No, thank you, I'm not hungry.

594
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:18,918
It is a tradition among men:

595
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:20,838
- Eat it.
- Eat it.

596
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:22,918
- Eat it.
- Eat it.

597
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,398
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

598
00:31:42,878 --> 00:31:44,838
You fuckers! That's not funny!

599
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:46,438
You're not supposed to eat it.

600
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:47,638
You all were chanting.

601
00:31:47,758 --> 00:31:50,558
Maybe there's some donkey cock
in your carriage!

602
00:31:50,678 --> 00:31:52,998
Fuck you, Boremont!
Manious, fuck you!

603
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:54,238
I hate all of you.

604
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:55,918
Thadeous!

605
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:57,518
Come back.

606
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:00,518
Thadeous, come here.

607
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:27,238
Dark master,

608
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:30,998
it is I, Julie.

609
00:32:31,358 --> 00:32:33,278
We have crossed the hazel meadow,

610
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:36,558
and are now taking rest
at the Cliffs of Kuneman.

611
00:32:36,678 --> 00:32:39,878
Now that the Princes of Mourne
have left their stronghold

612
00:32:39,998 --> 00:32:42,238
their vulnerabilities
are in your hands.

613
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:43,438
My hands.

614
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:45,278
Bring Prince Fabious to me alive.

615
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:48,078
I would like him to witness
as I impregnate his love.

616
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:49,318
Impregnate.

617
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:50,798
As for Thadeous and his boy,

618
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:55,158
toss them from the Cliffs of Kuneman.
They're useless.

619
00:32:56,318 --> 00:32:58,398
Fart.

620
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,438
Knock, knock. May I come in?

621
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,118
No, leave me alone.
Get out of here.

622
00:33:03,238 --> 00:33:07,438
Thadeous, you must calm down.
It's over.

623
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:09,918
You ate the heart,
you passed the initiation.

624
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:10,958
Passed?

625
00:33:11,078 --> 00:33:13,038
You made me look stupid
in front of all your friends.

626
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,558
And don't think I'm not telling father
because I'm going to.

627
00:33:15,678 --> 00:33:18,878
Thadeous, we were just having some fun,
and it was perfect.

628
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,198
Now they know you're
not to be fucked with.

629
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:23,198
Excuse me, sir,
sorry for the intrusion.

630
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:25,558
I have just witnessed
a most disturbing incident.

631
00:33:25,678 --> 00:33:27,398
There must be
a misunderstanding.

632
00:33:27,518 --> 00:33:29,238
Julie is my most
trusted confidant.

633
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:30,518
Julie is an idiot.

634
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:31,958
No, he's not. He's a gentleman.

635
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:33,678
Julie is what, Your Highness?

636
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:35,118
I'm not sure, Julie.

637
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:37,438
Courtney said he saw
some suspicious behavior.

638
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:42,318
You, I saw you talking with Leezar.

639
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:47,958
How dare you watch me
in my private moments.

640
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,118
He's stolen my vision.

641
00:33:54,238 --> 00:33:56,038
Get him, Courtney!

642
00:33:57,398 --> 00:33:59,158
Come here!

643
00:34:01,318 --> 00:34:02,918
You old beast.

644
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:04,758
Courtney, just restrain him
with all your might.

645
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:06,518
No, slay him!

646
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:07,638
Murder him!

647
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:09,798
Die of me.

648
00:34:13,198 --> 00:34:14,518
What?

649
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:17,838
Don't move,
you're surrounded.

650
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:20,678
Julie has no dick!

651
00:34:21,078 --> 00:34:22,158
Boremont!

652
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:24,158
Help!

653
00:34:25,758 --> 00:34:26,678
Knights!

654
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,278
A turncoat has been discovered!

655
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:29,878
Prince Fabious, what is wrong?

656
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:31,278
Boremont, seize Julie,

657
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:32,758
I'm afraid he's betrayed us!

658
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:35,038
That thing is a dickless traitor!

659
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,638
- A traitor, you say.
- Yes.

660
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:39,238
I saw him seeking counsel
with Leezar.

661
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,558
Counsel? With Leezar?

662
00:34:42,678 --> 00:34:44,758
Well, if what they say is true,

663
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,998
then, Julie,
I have but one question for you.

664
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:49,958
What were our master's orders?

665
00:34:50,078 --> 00:34:51,078
What?

666
00:34:51,198 --> 00:34:52,758
His orders were simple.

667
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:55,398
Capture Fabious and kill the rest.

668
00:34:55,518 --> 00:34:58,198
Boremont, how could you?

669
00:34:58,318 --> 00:34:59,758
What about the code
of the Knights Elite?

670
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:01,038
Code?

671
00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:02,958
Upon your choice
of best man for your wedding,

672
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:05,238
your "code" became clear to me.

673
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:07,398
You hurt my feelings.

674
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:10,078
Now I shall hurt yours.

675
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:12,118
Kill them all!

676
00:35:12,238 --> 00:35:14,598
Look out!

677
00:35:20,478 --> 00:35:21,398
To the carriage!

678
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:23,118
Your friends tried to slay us.

679
00:35:23,238 --> 00:35:26,558
Those bastards! Get in!

680
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:31,878
After them!

681
00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:33,758
Okay, go!

682
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:44,358
We've got company!

683
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:45,598
Ready yourselves!

684
00:35:45,718 --> 00:35:47,718
These men are fierce!

685
00:35:52,798 --> 00:35:54,678
Oh, gods!

686
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:19,278
Under the cart you go!

687
00:36:22,478 --> 00:36:24,358
Fucking sword! Stab him!

688
00:36:24,478 --> 00:36:26,478
Stab him!

689
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:34,078
You cut his hair off!

690
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:44,998
Fabious, he's coming!

691
00:36:45,118 --> 00:36:47,518
I know, get up here!

692
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,838
Come on!

693
00:36:57,518 --> 00:36:58,678
Now what?

694
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:01,918
I have a plan.
We jump on the horses and ride away.

695
00:37:02,038 --> 00:37:03,598
But the horses, they're moving.

696
00:37:03,718 --> 00:37:06,358
I know. I know.

697
00:37:08,038 --> 00:37:10,198
Oh, shit!

698
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:14,478
Come on!

699
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:15,838
What? Want me, as well?

700
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,798
Now!

701
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,318
Face me, you traitor.

702
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:47,878
Look!

703
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:49,878
Oh, shit!

704
00:38:05,918 --> 00:38:07,878
We did it!

705
00:38:12,158 --> 00:38:14,318
Yes!

706
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:18,638
If I could have
everyone's attention.

707
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:21,238
I'd like to say a few words,
if I may.

708
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:23,638
I have prepared this feast

709
00:38:23,758 --> 00:38:26,598
in honor and appreciation
of Belladonna.

710
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:28,838
Seems like it was only yesterday

711
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:32,678
that we used sorcery
to burn your village to the ground,

712
00:38:32,798 --> 00:38:34,318
come in and snatch you.

713
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:35,518
But I remember looking at you

714
00:38:35,638 --> 00:38:37,238
all those years ago and thinking,

715
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:39,798
"That's a baby."

716
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:42,798
"And that's the baby that someday
I will have to have sex with."

717
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:44,438
Now, look at me.

718
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:47,358
A 19-year-old boy, almost a man,

719
00:38:47,718 --> 00:38:49,238
still a virgin.

720
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:50,478
To the fuckening!

721
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:52,198
Yes, to the fuckening!

722
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:56,278
Leezar, what is this rubbish
you have set before us?

723
00:38:56,398 --> 00:38:58,998
It's such a funny choice
for a feast.

724
00:38:59,118 --> 00:39:00,598
I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.

725
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:02,998
Dealing with her and you
and the fucking prophecy.

726
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:04,238
I mean, we could all just relax...

727
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:05,518
Master.

728
00:39:05,638 --> 00:39:07,358
What do you want, Julie?

729
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,718
Regrettably, the Princes of Mourne
have escaped.

730
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:12,118
You should've killed them
at the wedding when you had the chance.

731
00:39:12,238 --> 00:39:13,638
Fabious is of no purpose to us.

732
00:39:13,758 --> 00:39:14,798
Silence!

733
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:17,758
His purpose is to destroy you
and your evil ways.

734
00:39:17,878 --> 00:39:20,038
Would you shut up,
or I will love you less.

735
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,998
Are those fish fingers
you're eating?

736
00:39:22,118 --> 00:39:25,518
No more questions!
Now find them!

737
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:30,438
Shit! Fabious, the horses!
They're escaping.

738
00:39:30,558 --> 00:39:33,878
Yes, it's a distraction
to lead them off our trail.

739
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:36,078
And what are we to do now?
Walk all the way home?

740
00:39:36,198 --> 00:39:38,558
Home? We're not going home.

741
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:39,598
Just because the knights
betrayed us

742
00:39:39,718 --> 00:39:41,717
does not mean we give up
on the quest.

743
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,917
Together we can still accomplish
what needs to be done.

744
00:39:44,037 --> 00:39:45,917
How? We're lost, I'm hungry.

745
00:39:46,037 --> 00:39:48,157
This stump, it's putting
my asshole to sleep.

746
00:39:48,277 --> 00:39:51,117
Thadeous, your feet are bare.
Put your boots on.

747
00:39:51,237 --> 00:39:53,237
They're filthy,
I'm having them exfoliated.

748
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,677
No time for exfoliation.

749
00:39:56,797 --> 00:39:58,317
The compass points north.

750
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,237
We shall follow it still.

751
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:02,797
I will not give up till Belladonna
is safe in mine arms.

752
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,677
Oh, god.

753
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:09,357
Simon! Where have you been?

754
00:40:09,477 --> 00:40:10,397
Shit.

755
00:40:10,517 --> 00:40:11,637
What?

756
00:40:11,757 --> 00:40:14,317
I left goddamn Steven
back at camp.

757
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:15,637
Who's Steven?

758
00:40:15,757 --> 00:40:17,637
He's my loyal animal companion.

759
00:40:17,757 --> 00:40:20,997
And he means just as much to me
as Simon means to you.

760
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:23,557
But I guess
I'll never see him again.

761
00:40:23,677 --> 00:40:26,157
Very well.
I understand that bond.

762
00:40:26,277 --> 00:40:30,197
Let us return to camp,
face the traitors and rescue Steven.

763
00:40:30,317 --> 00:40:32,077
No, fuck it. It's over.

764
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:34,877
But, perhaps, since my animal companion
is no longer here,

765
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:38,037
it's only fair that we get rid
of yours as well.

766
00:40:39,157 --> 00:40:41,357
No, that would serve
no purpose, brother.

767
00:40:41,477 --> 00:40:43,317
That would be like
me asking you to get rid of Courtney

768
00:40:43,437 --> 00:40:45,197
just because Julie
is no longer with us.

769
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,397
I will drown Courtney
in the shallow fucking pond right now

770
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:48,557
if that means fair is fair.

771
00:40:48,677 --> 00:40:50,077
I don't like that idea, sir.

772
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,037
No, Simon can help us.

773
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:53,317
Simon,

774
00:40:53,437 --> 00:40:55,637
you must take this message
to father.

775
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:58,157
Tell him that
the Knights Elite betrayed us

776
00:40:58,277 --> 00:41:01,637
and he must send an army
across the valley to Muldiss Darton

777
00:41:01,757 --> 00:41:03,997
and help us retrieve
the Blade of Unicorn.

778
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:05,157
Hurry, Simon!

779
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:08,357
Fly to Mourne
and deliver these desperate words.

780
00:41:08,477 --> 00:41:12,117
Fly!

781
00:41:16,317 --> 00:41:19,117
Come on, Manious,
you've been sniffing dirt all morning.

782
00:41:19,237 --> 00:41:21,877
We would not be
in this position, Julie,

783
00:41:21,997 --> 00:41:24,717
if you wouldn't have gotten caught
communicating with Leezar.

784
00:41:24,837 --> 00:41:26,837
And if you ladies
were proper assassins,

785
00:41:26,957 --> 00:41:31,037
you'd have cut them down back there
as the Dark Lord commanded.

786
00:41:31,637 --> 00:41:33,397
Manious, what do you see?

787
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:36,117
They stepped towards the sun here.

788
00:41:36,237 --> 00:41:39,557
This blade of grass,
one of them pissed on it.

789
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:44,157
And then they moved, very quickly,
mind, towards...

790
00:41:44,277 --> 00:41:46,077
There!

791
00:41:47,077 --> 00:41:48,517
That's Marteetee's land.

792
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:49,637
What?

793
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,197
Our mission may
be completed sooner than I expected.

794
00:41:55,517 --> 00:41:58,037
If I may be so bold, Your Highness,

795
00:41:58,157 --> 00:42:00,997
what is the meaning
of that ribbon that you hold?

796
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:02,637
This?

797
00:42:02,757 --> 00:42:04,517
It's a gift from Belladonna.

798
00:42:04,637 --> 00:42:06,757
A symbol of her virgin purity.

799
00:42:06,877 --> 00:42:09,157
I hold it and savor it.

800
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:12,317
You do that instead
of have sex with her?

801
00:42:12,437 --> 00:42:14,517
Belladonna is unlike any maiden
in the kingdom.

802
00:42:14,637 --> 00:42:16,357
She behaves without judgment,

803
00:42:16,477 --> 00:42:18,157
defies expectation.

804
00:42:18,277 --> 00:42:19,797
When I first heard her voice

805
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:21,677
a tear came to my eye,

806
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:23,397
and that tear turned to ice,

807
00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:25,357
and I kept that frozen tear

808
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:28,677
far from my heart
that burns with passion.

809
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,277
If she had a wound,

810
00:42:30,397 --> 00:42:32,277
I would kiss it.

811
00:42:32,397 --> 00:42:34,557
If she had a splinter,

812
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,117
I would pull it
from her flesh with mine lips.

813
00:42:38,237 --> 00:42:43,317
Just say we are too late
and Leezar has had his way with her,

814
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:47,677
would you still be able to be with her?

815
00:42:47,997 --> 00:42:49,477
I don't want to think about that.

816
00:42:49,597 --> 00:42:51,397
But just say that we were moments late,

817
00:42:51,517 --> 00:42:54,997
and he was able to get her cookies.

818
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,117
Shut up.

819
00:42:56,237 --> 00:42:59,997
Yes, I know, but what if he butt-fucked
her? Would you still like her?

820
00:43:00,117 --> 00:43:01,677
Do I have to write you a poem?

821
00:43:01,797 --> 00:43:04,997
There's never been
a love so true as ours.

822
00:43:05,277 --> 00:43:06,757
That's pure love.

823
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:08,157
Yes, it is.

824
00:43:08,277 --> 00:43:09,797
No, that's pure love.

825
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:12,557
There's a naked woman
standing behind you.

826
00:43:13,397 --> 00:43:15,597
Who is that?

827
00:43:15,717 --> 00:43:17,557
Is she looking at us?

828
00:43:17,677 --> 00:43:19,397
Who is it? Is it him?
Are you looking to him?

829
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:21,477
Is it Courtney? Is it to me?

830
00:43:21,597 --> 00:43:23,397
It's Courtney. I think it's to me.

831
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,797
I believe she is
taking her trousers off.

832
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:29,837
Right, I will return momentarily.

833
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:30,997
No.

834
00:43:31,117 --> 00:43:32,757
Thadeous, it might be a trap.

835
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:36,877
The only thing those tits will trap
is my warm spray.

836
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:39,397
Have fun rubbing your ribbon.

837
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:41,237
Disgusting.

838
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:43,557
Come back here, you.

839
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:47,717
I'm beginning to think
he doesn't care about this quest.

840
00:43:47,837 --> 00:43:49,997
What could possibly
make you think that, sir?

841
00:43:50,117 --> 00:43:51,077
Oh, shit!

842
00:43:51,197 --> 00:43:53,517
Oh, shit! It's a trap.
A booby trap.

843
00:43:53,637 --> 00:43:54,517
Oh, god!

844
00:43:54,637 --> 00:43:56,077
It was a trap.

845
00:43:56,197 --> 00:43:57,677
White people, I knew it!

846
00:43:57,797 --> 00:43:58,797
White people?

847
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:00,517
- Are they nice or are they mean?
- They're mean!

848
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:02,077
They're the meanest!

849
00:44:02,197 --> 00:44:03,157
What do we do?

850
00:44:03,277 --> 00:44:04,997
I don't know.
It is against code to strike a woman.

851
00:44:05,117 --> 00:44:06,157
I'm sick of your silly codes.

852
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,317
Punch these ladies in the face!

853
00:44:17,037 --> 00:44:18,837
Sire, where are they taking us?

854
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:22,317
I don't know. Stay close!

855
00:44:52,517 --> 00:44:53,517
Marteetee.

856
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:54,597
Mart-who?

857
00:44:54,717 --> 00:44:57,237
Silence!

858
00:44:57,357 --> 00:45:00,117
Good day, my little bees

859
00:45:00,237 --> 00:45:04,357
and welcome to my most special
of events.

860
00:45:04,477 --> 00:45:06,957
We have a wonderful treat

861
00:45:07,077 --> 00:45:10,997
as you get to witness a sea
of babbling men

862
00:45:11,117 --> 00:45:13,757
behold their fates.

863
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:18,797
Enter, Dastardly!

864
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:34,637
Bloodthirsty creatures.

865
00:45:47,437 --> 00:45:51,597
Brother, if I die, you must promise me
to continue our quest.

866
00:46:00,957 --> 00:46:02,437
- Him.
- No!

867
00:46:02,557 --> 00:46:03,517
Kill him first!

868
00:46:03,637 --> 00:46:05,397
Stay away!

869
00:46:07,517 --> 00:46:08,597
Take the knife.

870
00:46:08,717 --> 00:46:09,877
Why?

871
00:46:09,997 --> 00:46:12,117
Watch this.

872
00:46:26,877 --> 00:46:27,877
Yes!

873
00:46:27,997 --> 00:46:30,357
No!

874
00:46:30,717 --> 00:46:33,157
Face! Yes!

875
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,597
We've bested your finest warrior.

876
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,757
Now grant us our freedom!

877
00:46:44,877 --> 00:46:45,837
Yeah!

878
00:46:45,957 --> 00:46:49,637
Bring Marteetee his cauldron!

879
00:46:51,397 --> 00:46:53,917
What is the cauldron?

880
00:46:59,837 --> 00:47:02,117
Are my bees ready

881
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:06,037
for the grand finale?

882
00:47:12,517 --> 00:47:15,077
Yes, my pet!

883
00:47:15,197 --> 00:47:17,437
Come forth

884
00:47:17,557 --> 00:47:22,717
and show thy bulbous!

885
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:32,717
Oh, shit!

886
00:47:47,677 --> 00:47:49,437
Oh, gods!

887
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:56,397
Over here!

888
00:47:57,597 --> 00:47:59,557
Hey, over here!

889
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:01,117
Over here!

890
00:48:01,237 --> 00:48:03,477
Bring your fight to me!

891
00:48:08,437 --> 00:48:10,237
Shit!

892
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,597
Thadeous!

893
00:48:26,717 --> 00:48:27,397
Shit!

894
00:48:27,517 --> 00:48:28,557
Sir!

895
00:48:28,677 --> 00:48:30,757
I've been bitten!
I can't move my leg.

896
00:48:30,877 --> 00:48:32,037
You've got to suck out the venom.

897
00:48:32,157 --> 00:48:33,397
I don't want to suck it!
You suck it!

898
00:48:33,517 --> 00:48:34,757
I can't suck my own venom!

899
00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:35,997
Yes, you can. I'll help you!

900
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:38,077
Suck it! Suck your venom.

901
00:48:38,197 --> 00:48:39,557
I can't reach it with my mouth!

902
00:48:39,677 --> 00:48:40,637
Courtney, suck the venom!

903
00:48:40,757 --> 00:48:42,677
- I've never sucked...
- Suck it!

904
00:48:42,797 --> 00:48:46,957
And who have we here?

905
00:48:47,077 --> 00:48:49,677
A sprightly little warrior you are.

906
00:48:49,797 --> 00:48:51,757
Suck it!
Right there! Suck it!

907
00:48:51,877 --> 00:48:56,517
I will make nice when I enter you!

908
00:48:56,797 --> 00:48:59,117
It's coming! It's coming!

909
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,237
Courtney spit the load!

910
00:49:01,357 --> 00:49:03,557
Don't swallow the venom! Spit it!

911
00:49:05,357 --> 00:49:07,957
Come on! Come on!

912
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:20,517
- Kill it!
- Fuck it up!

913
00:49:25,437 --> 00:49:27,197
Yes!

914
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:44,317
What?

915
00:49:44,877 --> 00:49:50,437
Who is he that dares destroy
my beautiful baby?

916
00:49:53,637 --> 00:49:54,557
It's a woman.

917
00:49:54,677 --> 00:49:55,717
I can see.

918
00:49:55,837 --> 00:49:56,997
Marteetee,

919
00:49:57,117 --> 00:49:58,957
when I was a child
you enslaved my father

920
00:49:59,077 --> 00:50:01,117
and slaughtered him
in this very arena.

921
00:50:01,237 --> 00:50:02,397
Today I avenge him.

922
00:50:02,517 --> 00:50:05,277
First by killing the beast,
second, by killing you.

923
00:50:05,397 --> 00:50:09,717
Well, well, my tiny bee...

924
00:50:12,757 --> 00:50:15,357
Oh, shit.

925
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:24,917
Let's go! We're going!

926
00:50:38,517 --> 00:50:39,877
- Brother, are you all right?
- I'm fine!

927
00:50:39,997 --> 00:50:41,877
Come on, let's go!

928
00:50:42,597 --> 00:50:44,677
This way!

929
00:50:55,317 --> 00:50:56,557
Excuse me, my lady.

930
00:50:56,677 --> 00:50:59,277
May I but speak with you a moment?

931
00:50:59,397 --> 00:51:00,677
I'd like to introduce myself.

932
00:51:00,797 --> 00:51:02,957
I am Prince Fabious of Mourne

933
00:51:03,077 --> 00:51:05,197
and this is my brother, Thadeous,

934
00:51:05,317 --> 00:51:07,797
and his squire, young Courtney.

935
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:08,837
Hello.

936
00:51:08,957 --> 00:51:11,597
We'd like to thank you
for your help with that dread beast.

937
00:51:11,717 --> 00:51:13,997
I have no time for
your maiden pleasantries.

938
00:51:14,117 --> 00:51:15,517
My quest continues to the north.

939
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:18,197
As does ours.

940
00:51:18,317 --> 00:51:19,997
I thought maybe for the sake
of both our quests,

941
00:51:20,117 --> 00:51:21,437
that we could travel together.

942
00:51:21,557 --> 00:51:23,957
At least, until we reach civilization.

943
00:51:24,077 --> 00:51:25,077
Yes, civilization.

944
00:51:25,197 --> 00:51:27,357
We are good men,
we're questing to save my...

945
00:51:27,477 --> 00:51:28,557
Excuse my brother.

946
00:51:28,677 --> 00:51:31,477
He's not familiar
with the customs of the road.

947
00:51:31,597 --> 00:51:33,997
Do not touch me.
Why are you making me look bad?

948
00:51:34,117 --> 00:51:36,797
A warrior on the road
never divulges the nature of his quest.

949
00:51:36,917 --> 00:51:39,237
One never knows if his aim may conflict
with another's.

950
00:51:39,357 --> 00:51:41,717
Yes, I was just being nice.

951
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:43,357
As we are on the same path,

952
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:46,077
I suppose you boys
may follow me to Muldiss Darton.

953
00:51:46,197 --> 00:51:48,237
From there I seek navigation
and march alone.

954
00:51:48,357 --> 00:51:51,477
We thank you. And may we have your name?

955
00:51:51,597 --> 00:51:52,717
I'm Isabel.

956
00:51:52,837 --> 00:51:55,237
The last living member
of the Harshbarger order.

957
00:51:55,357 --> 00:51:57,917
Well, Isabel,
my brother and myself will ensure

958
00:51:58,037 --> 00:52:00,277
that you run into no danger
while you travel with us.

959
00:52:00,397 --> 00:52:03,037
With our huge muscles,
we shall protect you.

960
00:52:03,157 --> 00:52:04,517
Who? Protect what?

961
00:52:04,637 --> 00:52:06,037
To be fair, everyone will protect

962
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:08,037
each other equally, I'm certain.

963
00:52:08,157 --> 00:52:12,797
But we will protect her more
because we are men.

964
00:52:19,797 --> 00:52:21,597
Gods!

965
00:52:21,717 --> 00:52:22,837
What are you doing, brother?

966
00:52:22,957 --> 00:52:25,397
What right do you have,
scaring a man like that?

967
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,197
What right have you to spy

968
00:52:27,317 --> 00:52:29,277
on a bathing woman from the shrubs?

969
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,317
I'm simply
keeping an eye on her.

970
00:52:31,437 --> 00:52:33,517
She is not like one
of our dimwitted chamber maids

971
00:52:33,637 --> 00:52:35,277
that let me take them from behind.

972
00:52:35,397 --> 00:52:36,837
This woman has me vexed.

973
00:52:36,957 --> 00:52:38,277
What exactly would it take for one

974
00:52:38,397 --> 00:52:40,717
to tame such an adventurous slut?

975
00:52:40,837 --> 00:52:43,557
I imagine she'd
want her man to be honorable,

976
00:52:43,677 --> 00:52:46,837
bold, brave,
know his way around a blade.

977
00:52:46,957 --> 00:52:51,397
Oh, god, she's looking at us.
Remain perfectly still.

978
00:53:13,197 --> 00:53:16,557
We're almost out of wood.

979
00:53:17,357 --> 00:53:20,797
Courtney, perhaps you and I should go
and collect some firewood.

980
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:21,877
Yeah.

981
00:53:21,997 --> 00:53:25,717
If you two wouldn't mind
tending these embers.

982
00:53:25,837 --> 00:53:27,197
No, of course not.

983
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:29,677
Tend away.

984
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:46,677
Care for another bite of some meat?

985
00:53:50,317 --> 00:53:52,757
You're not much for talking, are you?

986
00:53:52,877 --> 00:53:55,997
A true warrior must keep her focus
on the road.

987
00:53:56,117 --> 00:53:58,717
One never knows when
death might be dealt.

988
00:53:58,837 --> 00:54:00,917
Yes, of course.

989
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:05,757
I've been involved in many
death dealings in focus-al moments.

990
00:54:05,877 --> 00:54:08,837
Yes, by your childish shrieks
in the face of Marteetee's beast,

991
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:10,677
one could see as much.

992
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:12,437
What exactly is your problem with me?

993
00:54:12,557 --> 00:54:15,037
Do you have a sword stuck
so far up your butt-hole

994
00:54:15,157 --> 00:54:17,717
that you cannot even enjoy yourself
for one moment?

995
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:20,317
My quest affords me no such luxury.

996
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:22,677
Not even on a tender night like this?

997
00:54:22,797 --> 00:54:24,237
The moons glimmering,

998
00:54:24,357 --> 00:54:27,157
the cold air licking your tits.

999
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:30,997
On a night just like this
I returned home from a hunt

1000
00:54:31,117 --> 00:54:32,957
to find a bloodbath.

1001
00:54:33,077 --> 00:54:35,117
Nothing remained of
my six beloved brothers

1002
00:54:35,237 --> 00:54:37,357
save for their severed heads on stakes.

1003
00:54:37,477 --> 00:54:39,157
Their eyes had been plucked,

1004
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:41,397
their teeth taken as tokens.

1005
00:54:41,517 --> 00:54:45,077
I wear this bracelet,
forged of the steel of their shields,

1006
00:54:45,197 --> 00:54:47,677
as a constant reminder
of my vow to avenge them.

1007
00:54:47,797 --> 00:54:51,157
My only advice would just
be to keep your head up,

1008
00:54:51,277 --> 00:54:52,637
hang in there,

1009
00:54:52,757 --> 00:54:54,837
live every day to the fullest,

1010
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:56,517
have sex as much as you can

1011
00:54:56,637 --> 00:54:58,157
by campfire when you're all alone

1012
00:54:58,277 --> 00:55:00,277
and your brother is out
gathering wood.

1013
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,597
Just simple things like that.

1014
00:55:04,037 --> 00:55:06,037
Do you think he'll make
love with her tonight?

1015
00:55:06,157 --> 00:55:08,677
Not a chance.

1016
00:55:11,277 --> 00:55:14,477
Either way, I've spent a lifetime
often envious of him.

1017
00:55:14,597 --> 00:55:15,957
Envious of Thadeous?

1018
00:55:16,077 --> 00:55:19,477
All the times that
he could sit back and have a laugh

1019
00:55:19,597 --> 00:55:22,197
and really enjoy the moment.

1020
00:55:22,317 --> 00:55:24,637
And I was up on stage

1021
00:55:24,757 --> 00:55:27,317
wearing make-up to cover my acne.

1022
00:55:27,437 --> 00:55:30,677
My hair perfectly coiffed,
even for war.

1023
00:55:31,597 --> 00:55:34,556
I think you misunderstand
the situation.

1024
00:55:34,676 --> 00:55:40,116
He constantly gazes at you
with such eager eyes.

1025
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,836
Sometimes he borrows your armor

1026
00:55:42,956 --> 00:55:46,836
and he prances around the courtyard,
flailing your sword,

1027
00:55:46,956 --> 00:55:49,396
going, "I am Fabious!

1028
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:52,396
"Look at me slay dragon."

1029
00:55:53,076 --> 00:55:56,076
He does it out of love.
He loves you, sir.

1030
00:55:56,196 --> 00:55:58,476
He adores you.

1031
00:56:00,036 --> 00:56:03,196
I know tragedy as well.
My mother is dead.

1032
00:56:03,316 --> 00:56:05,396
I have someone dead
in my family, too.

1033
00:56:05,516 --> 00:56:07,476
Also, recently

1034
00:56:07,596 --> 00:56:10,676
my brother's bride-to-be was stolen

1035
00:56:10,796 --> 00:56:12,716
by a devious wizard.

1036
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,876
Wizard?

1037
00:56:16,516 --> 00:56:18,676
If you could keep a secret,

1038
00:56:18,956 --> 00:56:20,276
it was Leezar.

1039
00:56:20,396 --> 00:56:22,316
Leezar?

1040
00:56:24,196 --> 00:56:26,356
I understand
he's a very dangerous man.

1041
00:56:26,476 --> 00:56:29,076
That's why Fabious turned to me.

1042
00:56:29,196 --> 00:56:33,116
The most bold and brave
and honorable man that he knows.

1043
00:56:33,436 --> 00:56:35,796
We aim to kill the magical cocksucker.

1044
00:56:35,916 --> 00:56:37,876
Do you see this compass?

1045
00:56:37,996 --> 00:56:40,796
What a fascinating device.

1046
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:43,356
It will lead us
to a labyrinth which holds a blade.

1047
00:56:43,476 --> 00:56:47,156
The only weapon
strong enough to defeat the wizard.

1048
00:56:47,276 --> 00:56:49,876
Well, perhaps I misjudged you.

1049
00:56:49,996 --> 00:56:51,476
It's not your fault.

1050
00:56:51,596 --> 00:56:54,316
I know I may seem like
I have a rugged exterior,

1051
00:56:54,436 --> 00:56:59,916
but underneath it all, I have
a golden heart that beats and beats.

1052
00:57:15,596 --> 00:57:18,476
So beautiful.

1053
00:57:21,836 --> 00:57:24,276
That poor creature.

1054
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:32,596
That's right.

1055
00:57:35,476 --> 00:57:36,636
Look at yourself.

1056
00:57:36,756 --> 00:57:39,476
Why would anyone ever
want to be with you?

1057
00:57:39,596 --> 00:57:41,436
I'm not sure, really.

1058
00:57:41,556 --> 00:57:43,316
Oh, yeah.
Perhaps, because I'm rich,

1059
00:57:43,436 --> 00:57:45,556
I live in a castle and I can do magic.

1060
00:57:45,676 --> 00:57:51,356
Okay, then why did you need to
kidnap me if you're so desirable?

1061
00:57:51,476 --> 00:57:54,036
Because I'm the prophecy born, maybe.

1062
00:57:54,156 --> 00:57:56,236
Or I'm going to have a dragon soon

1063
00:57:56,356 --> 00:57:57,556
which I'll be able to control,

1064
00:57:57,676 --> 00:57:59,156
and it's going to
give me ultimate power.

1065
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:01,396
How? Because you can
make a dragon do things?

1066
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:03,916
Yes. I could make it devour people

1067
00:58:04,036 --> 00:58:06,356
or breathe fire over
the Kingdom of Mourne.

1068
00:58:06,476 --> 00:58:08,116
Sounds flimsy.

1069
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:11,956
First of all, you obviously don't know
jack shit about the prophecy.

1070
00:58:12,076 --> 00:58:14,996
How do you know that it won't be me
who controls the dragon?

1071
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,516
Because I am the chosen one.

1072
00:58:17,636 --> 00:58:20,876
Chosen one controls the dragon.

1073
00:58:20,996 --> 00:58:23,356
Those are the rules, basically.

1074
00:58:25,396 --> 00:58:26,836
What are you laughing at?

1075
00:58:26,956 --> 00:58:28,196
I was just thinking about your penis

1076
00:58:28,316 --> 00:58:31,076
and how unusual it must look.

1077
00:58:31,196 --> 00:58:32,676
It doesn't look unusual.

1078
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:34,396
How do you know it's going to work?

1079
00:58:34,516 --> 00:58:36,756
- Because I've tested it.
- Really?

1080
00:58:36,876 --> 00:58:40,596
And if your vagina is
anything like my hand

1081
00:58:40,716 --> 00:58:44,236
there will be no problem.

1082
00:58:46,796 --> 00:58:49,596
Fair warriors, arise.

1083
00:58:49,716 --> 00:58:51,716
Two days before the eclipse.

1084
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:54,836
Thadeous, hand me the compass
so I can check its shadow.

1085
00:58:54,956 --> 00:58:55,956
What?

1086
00:58:56,076 --> 00:58:57,956
The compass.

1087
00:59:00,116 --> 00:59:01,516
That's weird.

1088
00:59:01,636 --> 00:59:03,796
It was around my neck when I slept.

1089
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,396
Where is it, Thadeous?

1090
00:59:05,516 --> 00:59:07,396
I don't know. I just woke up.

1091
00:59:07,516 --> 00:59:09,916
Isabel seems to have gone.

1092
00:59:10,036 --> 00:59:11,196
Isabel!

1093
00:59:11,316 --> 00:59:12,276
Isabel!

1094
00:59:12,396 --> 00:59:14,116
Isabel!

1095
00:59:14,236 --> 00:59:14,716
Shit.

1096
00:59:14,836 --> 00:59:15,996
Thadeous,

1097
00:59:16,116 --> 00:59:17,396
you didn't by chance tell her

1098
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:20,276
anything about the nature
of our quest, did you?

1099
00:59:20,396 --> 00:59:22,836
I may have dropped

1100
00:59:22,956 --> 00:59:24,756
a few minor details.

1101
00:59:24,876 --> 00:59:26,796
Did you tell Isabel

1102
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:31,476
anything about the one-of-a-kind
mythical compass?

1103
00:59:33,996 --> 00:59:35,516
Gods!

1104
00:59:35,636 --> 00:59:37,116
She's run off with the compass.

1105
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:38,876
- We don't know that for sure.
- Oh, yeah?

1106
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:41,916
Where is it? Where is she?

1107
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:44,116
All right, well, it wasn't my fault.

1108
00:59:44,236 --> 00:59:46,396
I was falling madly in love with her.

1109
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:48,636
I was bedazzled by her sweet bosom.

1110
00:59:48,756 --> 00:59:49,676
I was helpless.

1111
00:59:49,796 --> 00:59:50,836
You fool!

1112
00:59:50,956 --> 00:59:54,156
Without the compass,
how do we find the Blade of Unicorn?

1113
00:59:54,276 --> 00:59:56,596
And without that sword,
how do we defeat Leezar?

1114
00:59:56,716 --> 00:59:59,636
Maybe we can find some other way,
with nets or something.

1115
00:59:59,756 --> 01:00:00,916
Nets?

1116
01:00:01,036 --> 01:00:02,516
Oh, that's a great plan.

1117
01:00:02,636 --> 01:00:05,396
And meanwhile, Belladonna's
going to get raped and die!

1118
01:00:05,516 --> 01:00:07,636
We don't know for sure
if she'll die.

1119
01:00:07,756 --> 01:00:09,116
Is this a joke to you?

1120
01:00:09,236 --> 01:00:11,796
Look, I'm sorry,
but I shouldn't even be here.

1121
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:14,356
We've almost been killed
multiple times.

1122
01:00:14,476 --> 01:00:16,156
I will probably die on this quest.

1123
01:00:16,276 --> 01:00:18,996
Courtney definitely will.

1124
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:21,276
Fuck Courtney, and fuck you!

1125
01:00:21,396 --> 01:00:24,156
Maybe they're right,
everything they say about you.

1126
01:00:24,276 --> 01:00:25,956
They only say that stuff because of you,

1127
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:28,476
because you go out
and have to pretend to be the best.

1128
01:00:28,596 --> 01:00:30,476
And they look at me
like I'm some sort of idiot.

1129
01:00:30,596 --> 01:00:32,596
Everyone in the kingdom
wants to suck your dick.

1130
01:00:32,716 --> 01:00:35,796
No one wants to suck mine!

1131
01:00:35,956 --> 01:00:37,996
Oh, Thadeous,

1132
01:00:38,116 --> 01:00:41,116
you have the potential
to be such a noble warrior,

1133
01:00:41,236 --> 01:00:43,756
but instead you just
let yourself go,

1134
01:00:43,876 --> 01:00:45,756
and everyone around you.

1135
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:48,636
You have no idea
what it's like to be me.

1136
01:00:48,756 --> 01:00:50,876
Being your brother is a curse.

1137
01:00:50,996 --> 01:00:54,956
I'd rather be brothers
with anyone else but you.

1138
01:00:58,356 --> 01:01:01,876
You say nothing else
for fear of what I might do.

1139
01:01:01,996 --> 01:01:04,516
Nothing!

1140
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:07,996
Now get dressed and comb your hair.

1141
01:01:08,116 --> 01:01:10,316
I'm going to Muldiss Darton.

1142
01:01:34,636 --> 01:01:36,996
Sex.

1143
01:01:45,796 --> 01:01:47,676
Come on, Courtney.

1144
01:01:47,796 --> 01:01:49,876
Come on.

1145
01:01:58,796 --> 01:02:03,316
For better or worse, we're here.
Muldiss Darton.

1146
01:02:15,236 --> 01:02:16,476
You and Courtney entertain yourselves.

1147
01:02:16,596 --> 01:02:18,116
I'm going off to find the sword alone.

1148
01:02:18,236 --> 01:02:19,196
Alone?

1149
01:02:19,316 --> 01:02:20,876
I can't afford to waste any more time.

1150
01:02:20,996 --> 01:02:23,476
Well, what are we to do?

1151
01:02:23,596 --> 01:02:26,836
Do whatever it is you do, Thadeous.

1152
01:02:28,876 --> 01:02:32,876
Well, obviously he's still upset.

1153
01:02:41,476 --> 01:02:43,356
Oh, gods, Courtney.

1154
01:02:43,476 --> 01:02:45,076
How my heart laments.

1155
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:48,876
Having been betrayed
by the sways of a beautiful woman.

1156
01:02:48,996 --> 01:02:51,796
And Fabious,
throwing his goddamn tantrums

1157
01:02:51,916 --> 01:02:54,796
with no regard for
anyone else's feelings.

1158
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:56,956
He really needs to consider...

1159
01:02:57,076 --> 01:02:58,756
Sir, look over there.

1160
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:01,996
It's that thieving Isabel.

1161
01:03:02,116 --> 01:03:05,556
My gods!
The balls of this woman!

1162
01:03:05,796 --> 01:03:07,636
Do you think any
of those men are her boyfriends?

1163
01:03:07,756 --> 01:03:08,796
Possibly.

1164
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:10,636
Who would ever
want to be her boyfriend?

1165
01:03:10,756 --> 01:03:11,796
What do we do?

1166
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:13,396
I'll tell you what we do.

1167
01:03:13,516 --> 01:03:16,116
We go over there,
we get the compass back,

1168
01:03:16,236 --> 01:03:17,556
we give it to Fabious,

1169
01:03:17,676 --> 01:03:18,956
we make him feel horrible

1170
01:03:19,076 --> 01:03:20,476
for the way in which he treated me,

1171
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,396
and then you and I head for home.

1172
01:03:22,516 --> 01:03:24,756
You believe it to be
as easy as that, sir?

1173
01:03:24,876 --> 01:03:28,956
Courtney, she is a woman,
and we are a man.

1174
01:03:29,076 --> 01:03:31,636
How hard could this be?

1175
01:03:31,756 --> 01:03:33,396
It's my birthday today, you know.

1176
01:03:33,516 --> 01:03:35,636
Fuck that.

1177
01:04:01,596 --> 01:04:02,516
Boremont!

1178
01:04:02,636 --> 01:04:04,396
You dare to betray me twice?

1179
01:04:04,516 --> 01:04:06,276
No, it's the same betrayal as before.

1180
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:07,716
It all just counts as one.

1181
01:04:07,836 --> 01:04:11,036
I suggest you surrender
before my father's army gets here.

1182
01:04:11,156 --> 01:04:14,236
After Simon's message,
they should be arriving nigh on now.

1183
01:04:14,356 --> 01:04:16,436
Ah, yes.

1184
01:04:16,556 --> 01:04:19,756
About your tin pet.

1185
01:04:21,556 --> 01:04:23,956
Simon.

1186
01:04:26,356 --> 01:04:27,836
Best of luck with your quest.

1187
01:04:27,956 --> 01:04:30,356
And you with yours.

1188
01:04:34,436 --> 01:04:36,716
Not so fast, trickster.

1189
01:04:36,836 --> 01:04:38,556
Hello, Thadeous.

1190
01:04:38,676 --> 01:04:39,956
The time for pleasantries is through.

1191
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:41,756
Do you feel that tiny prick
in your back?

1192
01:04:41,876 --> 01:04:43,036
Is that your cock?

1193
01:04:43,156 --> 01:04:46,556
No, 'tis a knife,
but I'll gladly penetrate you with it.

1194
01:04:46,676 --> 01:04:48,276
Now look over your shoulder.

1195
01:04:48,396 --> 01:04:51,116
Other shoulder.

1196
01:04:53,236 --> 01:04:54,836
Frightening.

1197
01:04:54,956 --> 01:04:58,236
We have you surrounded.
An animal in a cage.

1198
01:04:58,356 --> 01:05:00,756
Now sit.

1199
01:05:06,316 --> 01:05:10,076
So, who were those handsome men
you were talking to?

1200
01:05:10,196 --> 01:05:11,636
My contacts.

1201
01:05:11,756 --> 01:05:13,076
By contacts do you mean

1202
01:05:13,196 --> 01:05:15,756
men you trick into liking you
so you can fuck them over?

1203
01:05:15,876 --> 01:05:17,076
What are you talking about?

1204
01:05:17,196 --> 01:05:18,156
You know what I'm talking about.

1205
01:05:18,276 --> 01:05:19,756
The compass. Hand it over now.

1206
01:05:19,876 --> 01:05:21,316
You lied. It does nothing.

1207
01:05:21,436 --> 01:05:24,156
Maybe if you would've
gone to the Wize Wizard like we did,

1208
01:05:24,276 --> 01:05:27,796
he could have explained to you that
it only works in sunlight.

1209
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:29,076
Really?

1210
01:05:29,196 --> 01:05:30,956
Shit, I shouldn't have told you that.

1211
01:05:31,076 --> 01:05:32,716
Isn't the Wize Wizard a pervert?

1212
01:05:32,836 --> 01:05:34,196
Yes.

1213
01:05:34,316 --> 01:05:36,436
Sadly, I think he molested my brother.

1214
01:05:36,556 --> 01:05:37,716
That's unfortunate.

1215
01:05:37,836 --> 01:05:40,156
Enough of your sympathy.
The compass. Give it.

1216
01:05:40,276 --> 01:05:42,196
I need it to destroy Leezar.

1217
01:05:42,316 --> 01:05:43,596
Your quest is to kill Leezar?

1218
01:05:43,716 --> 01:05:46,516
Yes. My family is the order
of the Golden Knights.

1219
01:05:46,636 --> 01:05:49,836
We're sworn to obstruct the prophecy
of the dragon eclipse.

1220
01:05:49,956 --> 01:05:51,356
That's what the Golden Knights do?

1221
01:05:51,476 --> 01:05:53,236
It is my legacy to stop anyone

1222
01:05:53,356 --> 01:05:55,276
who wants to fuck to make dragons.

1223
01:05:55,396 --> 01:05:58,236
Yuck. Well, that's the same thing
we're trying to do.

1224
01:05:58,356 --> 01:06:00,436
Why would you hinder us
and steal the compass?

1225
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,916
His mothers sent my brothers
to their death.

1226
01:06:03,036 --> 01:06:04,676
I must stop Leezar
and I can't afford

1227
01:06:04,796 --> 01:06:06,196
to let anyone get in my way.

1228
01:06:06,316 --> 01:06:08,756
Least of all, a slob and his boy.

1229
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:10,676
Guess what? I despise you.

1230
01:06:10,796 --> 01:06:12,756
You're a bully and a whore.

1231
01:06:12,876 --> 01:06:14,636
Now give me the compass now.

1232
01:06:14,756 --> 01:06:15,676
And if I don't?

1233
01:06:15,796 --> 01:06:17,596
Well,

1234
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,716
then things will get very nasty.

1235
01:06:21,836 --> 01:06:22,836
Oh, really?

1236
01:06:22,956 --> 01:06:25,236
Oh, really.

1237
01:06:28,436 --> 01:06:30,156
Shit!

1238
01:06:32,876 --> 01:06:34,676
Oh, shit!

1239
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:38,036
God!
Courtney, fucking do something.

1240
01:06:38,156 --> 01:06:39,476
Your Highness!

1241
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:40,596
Excuse me.

1242
01:06:40,716 --> 01:06:42,476
What the fuck?

1243
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,556
Take that shit outside!

1244
01:06:51,676 --> 01:06:53,516
Oh, sorry.

1245
01:07:01,836 --> 01:07:03,676
Hello.

1246
01:07:36,556 --> 01:07:38,996
Thank you for the hospitality,
gentlemen.

1247
01:07:39,116 --> 01:07:40,476
That didn't really go as planned.

1248
01:07:40,596 --> 01:07:42,036
She's gone and now
so is the compass.

1249
01:07:42,156 --> 01:07:43,836
She is, indeed, gone, sir.

1250
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:46,596
The compass, however,
is right here.

1251
01:07:46,716 --> 01:07:49,116
Courtney, my good man.

1252
01:07:49,476 --> 01:07:50,556
How did you do it?

1253
01:07:50,676 --> 01:07:51,796
Before your father bought me,

1254
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:54,996
I was a sex slave for a band of gypsies
in the north

1255
01:07:55,116 --> 01:07:58,356
and they taught me a thing or two
about sleight-of-hand.

1256
01:07:58,476 --> 01:07:59,956
Oh, you.

1257
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,076
Now you see me, now you don't.

1258
01:08:02,196 --> 01:08:03,996
Delicious.

1259
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:07,516
I can't wait to see the look

1260
01:08:07,636 --> 01:08:10,196
on Fabious' silly face
when he sees this.

1261
01:08:10,316 --> 01:08:12,076
Clear!

1262
01:08:16,076 --> 01:08:17,036
Fabious.

1263
01:08:17,156 --> 01:08:19,156
What do we do?

1264
01:08:19,276 --> 01:08:20,396
I'll tell you what we do.

1265
01:08:20,516 --> 01:08:23,636
We will steal a steed
and we will ride to the next town.

1266
01:08:23,756 --> 01:08:25,276
We become ghosts,
start a brand new life,

1267
01:08:25,396 --> 01:08:27,636
one where you still serve me.
And we're stable boys,

1268
01:08:27,756 --> 01:08:30,516
- and we bed the fickle wives of farmers.
- What about Fabious?

1269
01:08:30,636 --> 01:08:33,036
Oh, Fabious.
We'll remember him fondly.

1270
01:08:33,156 --> 01:08:35,596
I really think we should try
and rescue him.

1271
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:38,676
But, how, Courtney?
You are weak, and I am hungry.

1272
01:08:38,996 --> 01:08:42,196
You deceitful pricks.
You stole the compass from me.

1273
01:08:42,316 --> 01:08:44,596
Who? I didn't. Courtney did.

1274
01:08:44,716 --> 01:08:46,836
Please have mercy on us, lady warrior.

1275
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,516
Fabious has been captured
by Leezar and his men.

1276
01:08:49,636 --> 01:08:51,116
He was captured?

1277
01:08:51,236 --> 01:08:52,476
Yes.

1278
01:08:52,596 --> 01:08:55,276
We got into a huge swordfight

1279
01:08:55,396 --> 01:08:57,076
and we were able to escape

1280
01:08:57,196 --> 01:08:58,996
and he was not.

1281
01:08:59,116 --> 01:09:00,956
I know how you're feeling inside.

1282
01:09:01,076 --> 01:09:02,036
As if you cannot rest

1283
01:09:02,156 --> 01:09:05,676
until you destroy those
who harmed your family.

1284
01:09:05,796 --> 01:09:09,436
You want to skin them alive
then wear their flesh as a cape

1285
01:09:09,556 --> 01:09:13,316
as you dance around
their convulsing corpses.

1286
01:09:13,836 --> 01:09:14,756
Yes, of course.

1287
01:09:14,876 --> 01:09:15,956
Yes.

1288
01:09:16,076 --> 01:09:18,196
That feeling is all too familiar.

1289
01:09:18,316 --> 01:09:19,556
It's been burning in my beaver

1290
01:09:19,676 --> 01:09:22,036
since the day I lost my brothers.

1291
01:09:22,156 --> 01:09:24,156
We've had our differences,

1292
01:09:24,276 --> 01:09:25,716
but if we work together,

1293
01:09:25,836 --> 01:09:28,716
we can save your brother,
avenge my family,

1294
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:32,276
and destroy Leezar once and for all.

1295
01:09:32,396 --> 01:09:35,756
This woman is mad.

1296
01:09:53,716 --> 01:09:55,836
I believe we found our labyrinth.

1297
01:09:55,956 --> 01:09:59,156
Where?
The compass has led us to a dead end.

1298
01:09:59,276 --> 01:10:01,196
Shall we return home?

1299
01:10:01,316 --> 01:10:03,116
It appears as though there's
something written here

1300
01:10:03,236 --> 01:10:05,236
in the language
of the Highland Dwarf.

1301
01:10:05,356 --> 01:10:06,636
I can't read it.

1302
01:10:06,756 --> 01:10:11,316
Sir, you're well-versed in the
Highland Dwarf language, aren't you?

1303
01:10:11,436 --> 01:10:13,556
You read Dwarf, Thadeous?

1304
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:16,476
I have had encounters
with those people, yes.

1305
01:10:16,596 --> 01:10:19,676
Really?
Well, then what does it say?

1306
01:10:19,796 --> 01:10:21,996
Fucker.

1307
01:10:29,356 --> 01:10:30,716
It's nonsense.

1308
01:10:30,836 --> 01:10:34,396
It says, "What leads you here
will lead you there."

1309
01:10:34,516 --> 01:10:35,676
It's rubbish.

1310
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:37,276
Highland Dwarves are a silly culture.

1311
01:10:37,396 --> 01:10:41,156
Oftentimes they speak and I have
no idea what they're talking about.

1312
01:10:42,956 --> 01:10:44,276
What is she doing?

1313
01:10:44,396 --> 01:10:46,556
Perfect fit.

1314
01:11:05,836 --> 01:11:07,676
You coming?

1315
01:11:49,515 --> 01:11:51,835
What is that foul stench?

1316
01:11:52,195 --> 01:11:53,755
What was that noise?

1317
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:58,155
I don't know, Courtney.
But I don't like this.

1318
01:12:07,475 --> 01:12:10,635
I fear we're not alone in here.

1319
01:12:31,955 --> 01:12:35,275
What is that thing?
I don't know, but run!

1320
01:12:38,475 --> 01:12:40,435
Isabel!

1321
01:12:45,835 --> 01:12:47,515
Sir?

1322
01:12:47,635 --> 01:12:49,435
Help! Your Highness!

1323
01:12:49,555 --> 01:12:51,035
Courtney!

1324
01:12:51,155 --> 01:12:52,275
Thadeous!

1325
01:12:52,395 --> 01:12:54,035
Isabel!

1326
01:12:54,155 --> 01:12:57,515
Companions, where are you?

1327
01:12:59,115 --> 01:13:01,915
Courtney! Hello?

1328
01:13:02,035 --> 01:13:04,075
Thadeous!

1329
01:13:09,195 --> 01:13:11,035
Where are you, sire?

1330
01:14:00,835 --> 01:14:03,795
This is the Blade of Unicorn?

1331
01:14:03,915 --> 01:14:06,515
It's just bones.

1332
01:14:11,235 --> 01:14:13,995
You've found it.

1333
01:14:14,195 --> 01:14:16,235
Who said that?

1334
01:14:16,355 --> 01:14:21,115
'Tis I, the soul of this maze
and protector of the blade.

1335
01:14:21,235 --> 01:14:22,875
'Tis my duty to ensure

1336
01:14:22,995 --> 01:14:27,075
only a true hero carries the blade
from this tomb.

1337
01:14:27,195 --> 01:14:28,275
Okay.

1338
01:14:28,395 --> 01:14:30,355
Say, for instance,
a man entered here

1339
01:14:30,475 --> 01:14:32,435
by accident
who wasn't a true hero.

1340
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:34,195
What would happen to him?

1341
01:14:34,315 --> 01:14:36,275
Death.

1342
01:14:36,395 --> 01:14:38,035
I see. Well,

1343
01:14:38,155 --> 01:14:39,675
I am no true hero.

1344
01:14:39,795 --> 01:14:43,995
So I would like to just place the sword
back where I found it,

1345
01:14:44,115 --> 01:14:47,315
and then I will go my way,
and you won't kill me,

1346
01:14:47,435 --> 01:14:49,115
and that will be that, okay?

1347
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,475
Go?

1348
01:14:50,595 --> 01:14:53,715
Where would you like to go?

1349
01:14:56,515 --> 01:14:57,595
Is that...

1350
01:14:57,715 --> 01:14:59,435
Your home.

1351
01:14:59,555 --> 01:15:02,755
Okay, well, I would surely go there.
That would be fine.

1352
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:05,395
Shall I just slide
the sword back into the thingy,

1353
01:15:05,515 --> 01:15:07,515
or place it gently upon the ground?

1354
01:15:07,635 --> 01:15:09,635
And if I told you that your brother

1355
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:12,355
will die without the help
of this blade,

1356
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:15,115
would you still
walk through that door?

1357
01:15:15,235 --> 01:15:18,635
Without the blade,
Fabious will be helpless against Leezar.

1358
01:15:18,995 --> 01:15:21,435
Shut your magical hole.
Why are you showing me this?

1359
01:15:21,555 --> 01:15:24,315
It's what you wanted, is it not?

1360
01:15:24,435 --> 01:15:25,675
Your brother gone.

1361
01:15:25,795 --> 01:15:28,355
You'll be king of all the land.

1362
01:15:28,475 --> 01:15:30,635
Think of the power,

1363
01:15:30,755 --> 01:15:34,435
the women, the bush,
the sticky-icky, the honeypots.

1364
01:15:34,555 --> 01:15:37,675
Well, it would be nice to be king.

1365
01:15:37,795 --> 01:15:41,715
And all you have to do
is forget about the blade.

1366
01:15:41,835 --> 01:15:47,715
Leave it where you found it
and never think of this place again.

1367
01:15:49,315 --> 01:15:54,435
That's very sweet
but I am not a female Minotaur.

1368
01:15:56,195 --> 01:15:58,835
His worm is tickling me.

1369
01:16:03,555 --> 01:16:05,675
Get off of me!

1370
01:16:05,835 --> 01:16:08,435
I'm not enjoying this!

1371
01:16:09,155 --> 01:16:11,235
Get off me.

1372
01:16:41,155 --> 01:16:43,115
Did you just see that?

1373
01:16:43,235 --> 01:16:45,795
I came back for you all!
I saved you!

1374
01:16:45,915 --> 01:16:47,875
What, you were going to leave us?

1375
01:16:47,995 --> 01:16:50,155
No, of course not.

1376
01:16:50,275 --> 01:16:52,195
Is that the...

1377
01:16:52,315 --> 01:16:53,875
Blade of Unicorn?

1378
01:16:53,995 --> 01:16:56,995
Yes, my companions, it is.

1379
01:16:57,115 --> 01:16:58,475
It's so beautiful.

1380
01:16:58,595 --> 01:17:01,955
It's very, very sharp.

1381
01:17:03,235 --> 01:17:05,995
Come here, you silly.

1382
01:17:07,755 --> 01:17:09,715
What are you doing?

1383
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:14,315
I was just trying to cut this horn
as a souvenir of my kill,

1384
01:17:14,435 --> 01:17:17,075
but it's proving to be
a bit of a bitch.

1385
01:17:17,475 --> 01:17:21,355
You can never sever the horn
of a Minotaur.

1386
01:17:28,515 --> 01:17:29,835
Only a champion man

1387
01:17:29,955 --> 01:17:32,715
would hold the Blade of Unicorn
in his hands.

1388
01:17:32,835 --> 01:17:36,715
And I, Thadeous, am that man.

1389
01:17:37,035 --> 01:17:38,915
I have seen the pain
in my reflection

1390
01:17:39,035 --> 01:17:43,435
and watched the strength
of my brother, unflinching.

1391
01:17:43,915 --> 01:17:45,835
My quest is one of love,

1392
01:17:45,955 --> 01:17:49,355
but also in this moment
of forgiveness, of redemption,

1393
01:17:49,475 --> 01:17:52,475
even amongst the smallest of foes.

1394
01:17:59,395 --> 01:18:01,315
My path has been unstable

1395
01:18:01,435 --> 01:18:05,195
but my conviction is born
to damn the fuckers who doubted me.

1396
01:18:05,315 --> 01:18:08,395
To lessen the assholes who tested me.

1397
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:18,635
To right what is wrong.

1398
01:18:18,755 --> 01:18:22,475
To restore faith
that has long been lost.

1399
01:18:22,595 --> 01:18:25,395
And to rise to great heights
even beyond my own legend

1400
01:18:25,515 --> 01:18:28,515
as a great cocksmith,
master pintsman,

1401
01:18:28,635 --> 01:18:33,995
and stunningly handsome prince
of light in these dark Dark Ages.

1402
01:18:35,395 --> 01:18:36,875
True trials await,

1403
01:18:36,995 --> 01:18:38,955
and I will greet thee
with the hammer of my fist

1404
01:18:39,075 --> 01:18:42,555
and the slide of my sword.

1405
01:18:42,915 --> 01:18:45,915
As the fog clears,
I will follow the voice that guides me.

1406
01:18:46,035 --> 01:18:50,315
My love, my heart, my gods.

1407
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:52,155
The time is now!

1408
01:18:52,275 --> 01:18:55,315
Let us quest!

1409
01:18:55,675 --> 01:18:59,755
At long last,
I have you firmly in my grasp.

1410
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:02,315
The pesky Prince Fabious.

1411
01:19:02,435 --> 01:19:05,515
The little sneak
who time and time again

1412
01:19:05,635 --> 01:19:07,715
has foiled every one of my plots.

1413
01:19:07,835 --> 01:19:10,435
Who has slain every one of my beasts.

1414
01:19:10,555 --> 01:19:13,515
Who has bested me
without fail until now.

1415
01:19:13,635 --> 01:19:17,355
Do what you will to me.
But unhand my love.

1416
01:19:17,475 --> 01:19:19,435
Let Belladonna go!

1417
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:21,195
Cast your glance heavenward

1418
01:19:21,315 --> 01:19:24,955
and know that when the ceiling parts,
and the moons align,

1419
01:19:25,075 --> 01:19:28,035
I will be entering your love.

1420
01:19:28,155 --> 01:19:30,155
Sacrilege!
You wretched wizard.

1421
01:19:30,275 --> 01:19:33,915
My mothers have already
moistened Belladonna for foreplay.

1422
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:37,235
You'll excuse me if I take my leave.

1423
01:19:37,955 --> 01:19:39,875
I shall kill you!

1424
01:19:39,995 --> 01:19:42,635
Julie, Julie, get me out of here.

1425
01:19:42,755 --> 01:19:44,555
Leezar has a hold of your mind.

1426
01:19:44,675 --> 01:19:46,955
He has allowed me
to get even with you.

1427
01:19:47,075 --> 01:19:49,515
For too long
you and your family

1428
01:19:49,635 --> 01:19:52,155
have treated me
like an employee.

1429
01:19:52,275 --> 01:19:54,675
Yeah, you were my slave.

1430
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:56,555
Yes, well not anymore.

1431
01:19:56,675 --> 01:19:58,715
Boremont, my comrade.

1432
01:19:58,835 --> 01:20:01,035
Please, get me out of here.

1433
01:20:01,155 --> 01:20:05,515
If Leezar wins tonight, the entire world
will tumble into darkness.

1434
01:20:05,635 --> 01:20:08,355
My heart has soured
on this world long ago.

1435
01:20:08,475 --> 01:20:10,955
Perhaps a regime change
is just what it's needed.

1436
01:20:11,075 --> 01:20:14,675
Boremont, you gave your hand for me.
Now you're taking my heart.

1437
01:20:14,795 --> 01:20:17,155
We used to have
fucking picnics together.

1438
01:20:17,275 --> 01:20:19,595
Remember when we crossed swords
and touched tips?

1439
01:20:19,715 --> 01:20:20,835
Do you remember?

1440
01:20:20,955 --> 01:20:23,075
Look at me, Boremont!

1441
01:20:23,195 --> 01:20:24,955
Don't do this.

1442
01:20:25,075 --> 01:20:28,435
Anyway, so that you don't feel like
you're missing out on any of the fun,

1443
01:20:28,555 --> 01:20:31,955
let me introduce you
to my friend, Timotay.

1444
01:20:32,075 --> 01:20:34,235
As Leezar enters Belladonna,

1445
01:20:34,355 --> 01:20:37,035
he will lower you onto that spike,

1446
01:20:37,155 --> 01:20:40,635
thereby giving you
a good poking as well.

1447
01:20:40,755 --> 01:20:43,595
Belladonna, I love you!

1448
01:20:58,035 --> 01:20:59,435
All right.

1449
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:02,795
Well, seeing that I did
the bulk of the work in the labyrinth,

1450
01:21:02,915 --> 01:21:05,555
perhaps it's one
of your turns to lead the way now.

1451
01:21:05,675 --> 01:21:08,435
Step back, new friends.
I'll lead the way.

1452
01:21:08,555 --> 01:21:10,955
For tonight, evil has met its match.

1453
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:15,555
Fantastic!
Thank you again for coming.

1454
01:21:23,675 --> 01:21:25,435
God.

1455
01:21:25,555 --> 01:21:27,355
Right out of the gate.

1456
01:21:27,475 --> 01:21:29,915
We should proceed
with a bit more caution.

1457
01:21:30,035 --> 01:21:31,635
Let go of me!

1458
01:21:31,755 --> 01:21:35,115
You foul witches! I hate you all.

1459
01:21:35,235 --> 01:21:36,555
Stop laughing.

1460
01:21:36,675 --> 01:21:38,075
Silence!

1461
01:21:38,195 --> 01:21:40,035
Let me go!

1462
01:21:40,155 --> 01:21:43,595
I shall be unable to have sex with her
with all that shrieking.

1463
01:21:43,715 --> 01:21:46,195
If it's obedience that you want,

1464
01:21:46,315 --> 01:21:48,795
we will put her under a spell.

1465
01:21:49,275 --> 01:21:50,475
She will surrender.

1466
01:21:50,595 --> 01:21:52,955
Obey.

1467
01:22:00,675 --> 01:22:03,795
Let it begin.

1468
01:22:36,995 --> 01:22:39,075
The winch, Courtney.

1469
01:22:39,195 --> 01:22:41,075
Brother! What are you doing here?

1470
01:22:41,195 --> 01:22:42,235
We came to rescue you.

1471
01:22:42,355 --> 01:22:43,355
You did?

1472
01:22:43,475 --> 01:22:45,195
Yes! Are you surprised?

1473
01:22:45,315 --> 01:22:46,235
Yes!

1474
01:22:46,355 --> 01:22:49,315
Courtney, you're still alive!
Isabel!

1475
01:22:49,875 --> 01:22:51,955
All right. Great.

1476
01:22:52,075 --> 01:22:54,195
We haven't much time!
Let's get weapons.

1477
01:22:54,315 --> 01:22:56,715
Fabious, there's something else
I should tell you.

1478
01:22:56,835 --> 01:22:57,835
What?

1479
01:22:57,955 --> 01:23:00,715
I would never let
your true love come to harm.

1480
01:23:00,835 --> 01:23:04,715
I present you
with the Blade of Unicorn.

1481
01:23:04,835 --> 01:23:08,035
Brother, it is beautiful.

1482
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:10,595
And Your Highness,
please forgive my deception.

1483
01:23:10,715 --> 01:23:13,355
Our two quests now work as one.

1484
01:23:13,475 --> 01:23:14,875
Nice.

1485
01:23:14,995 --> 01:23:16,995
We're in this together, sir.

1486
01:23:17,115 --> 01:23:19,275
Yes.

1487
01:23:20,235 --> 01:23:22,115
Simon!

1488
01:23:26,475 --> 01:23:28,635
Now mine eyes have seen it all.

1489
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:31,635
'Tis only a truce.
Courtney had him restored.

1490
01:23:31,755 --> 01:23:33,155
He manipulated me into friendship

1491
01:23:33,275 --> 01:23:35,915
by tugging at my heartstrings.

1492
01:23:37,115 --> 01:23:37,995
Right.

1493
01:23:38,115 --> 01:23:39,515
What's he saying?

1494
01:23:39,635 --> 01:23:42,355
It seems the way is more treacherous
than I thought.

1495
01:23:42,475 --> 01:23:44,675
I cannot ask you to come with me.

1496
01:23:44,795 --> 01:23:47,595
I know you do not expect
much from me, Fabious.

1497
01:23:47,715 --> 01:23:49,915
But I will stand with you
on this night.

1498
01:23:50,035 --> 01:23:53,915
Is this the same brother
that would not be my best man?

1499
01:23:54,035 --> 01:23:57,275
I did not deserve to be
your best man.

1500
01:23:57,395 --> 01:24:00,155
You do now.

1501
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:06,315
We can finish this
whenever you maidens are ready.

1502
01:24:07,195 --> 01:24:09,355
Ready!

1503
01:24:50,795 --> 01:24:51,755
The time is nigh!

1504
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:53,795
The moons are about to align.

1505
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:01,755
Intruders!

1506
01:25:01,875 --> 01:25:05,595
Prepare to be fist-fucked
by two brothers at once.

1507
01:25:08,115 --> 01:25:11,155
You're too late!
The fuckening has begun.

1508
01:25:11,275 --> 01:25:13,795
Get him!

1509
01:25:15,955 --> 01:25:16,995
You shit!

1510
01:25:17,115 --> 01:25:18,915
Kill them!

1511
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:54,475
Why is she making these noises?

1512
01:26:04,435 --> 01:26:06,235
Courtney!

1513
01:26:15,115 --> 01:26:16,995
Boremont!

1514
01:26:17,715 --> 01:26:19,515
Bastard!

1515
01:26:21,835 --> 01:26:23,355
Thadeous!

1516
01:26:23,475 --> 01:26:24,995
I'm not stiffening!

1517
01:26:25,115 --> 01:26:26,955
I'm just not attracted to you.

1518
01:26:27,075 --> 01:26:28,875
Fuck me!

1519
01:26:30,195 --> 01:26:32,075
Love me!

1520
01:26:42,835 --> 01:26:44,595
Adiós, motherfucker!

1521
01:26:44,715 --> 01:26:46,595
Teamwork!

1522
01:27:15,515 --> 01:27:18,634
God, I never wanted it
to end like this, old friend.

1523
01:27:18,754 --> 01:27:21,274
Master Fabious.

1524
01:27:21,394 --> 01:27:24,154
I loved you!

1525
01:27:24,954 --> 01:27:27,354
I loved you, too, Boremont.

1526
01:27:27,474 --> 01:27:28,954
As only a knight can love a knight.

1527
01:27:29,074 --> 01:27:30,914
No.

1528
01:27:31,114 --> 01:27:33,274
I loved you

1529
01:27:33,394 --> 01:27:37,554
as a man loves another man.

1530
01:27:56,194 --> 01:27:58,354
Jumping!

1531
01:28:31,114 --> 01:28:32,594
Quick! We must hurry!

1532
01:28:32,714 --> 01:28:36,234
What? No, no, don't suck that!
That's dead!

1533
01:28:55,474 --> 01:28:58,074
Next time you want to smash
a bloodline of knights,

1534
01:28:58,194 --> 01:29:00,034
make sure you kill all of them!

1535
01:29:00,154 --> 01:29:01,394
We did!

1536
01:29:01,514 --> 01:29:04,594
You forgot about their sister.

1537
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:21,874
Thadeous! What are you doing here?

1538
01:29:21,994 --> 01:29:23,634
I'm trying to rescue you.
We must hurry!

1539
01:29:23,754 --> 01:29:26,714
Step away from my virgin.

1540
01:29:28,594 --> 01:29:30,354
She's my brother's virgin.

1541
01:29:30,474 --> 01:29:32,634
If you want to fuck her,

1542
01:29:32,754 --> 01:29:35,554
you'll have to fuck me first.

1543
01:29:38,274 --> 01:29:40,714
It would be my pleasure.

1544
01:29:41,914 --> 01:29:43,394
Stop!

1545
01:29:43,514 --> 01:29:44,874
It's over.

1546
01:29:44,994 --> 01:29:48,594
Take your last breath with nobility.

1547
01:29:49,594 --> 01:29:51,874
You fool.

1548
01:29:51,994 --> 01:29:55,194
I cannot be slain by mortal blade.

1549
01:29:55,314 --> 01:29:56,434
One must possess the powerful...

1550
01:29:56,554 --> 01:29:58,314
I know.

1551
01:29:58,434 --> 01:30:00,714
Blade of Unicorn.

1552
01:30:01,154 --> 01:30:03,314
It's not possible.

1553
01:30:50,314 --> 01:30:52,474
My love.

1554
01:31:02,914 --> 01:31:04,314
Think I'm beginning to like the feel

1555
01:31:04,434 --> 01:31:07,554
of blood and filth
upon these fingers.

1556
01:31:07,674 --> 01:31:10,274
Perhaps I will never bathe again.

1557
01:31:10,874 --> 01:31:14,674
Unless, of course, there were a bitch
brave enough to bathe beside me.

1558
01:31:14,794 --> 01:31:16,274
You fought with honor.

1559
01:31:16,394 --> 01:31:19,274
Why don't you treat yourself
and take rest at our castle?

1560
01:31:19,394 --> 01:31:23,594
We've all the slaves, pickles
and servants one could ever desire.

1561
01:31:23,714 --> 01:31:28,034
We have dancing bears, Orientals
and all the berries you care to pick.

1562
01:31:28,154 --> 01:31:30,674
I wish I could, but I never rest.

1563
01:31:30,794 --> 01:31:33,794
There's yet another quest
that calls me to the Western Marshes.

1564
01:31:33,914 --> 01:31:35,114
I must surprise a band of thieves

1565
01:31:35,234 --> 01:31:39,394
and burn them alive one by one
in a symphony of shrieks.

1566
01:31:39,834 --> 01:31:42,234
I will not forget you, Prince.

1567
01:31:42,354 --> 01:31:44,794
Nor will I.

1568
01:31:48,994 --> 01:31:51,874
Here. To remember me.

1569
01:31:51,994 --> 01:31:54,634
I don't want that thing touching me.

1570
01:31:54,754 --> 01:31:56,234
Say hello.

1571
01:31:56,354 --> 01:31:57,354
No.

1572
01:31:57,474 --> 01:31:58,794
I fucking killed this dick.
Take it.

1573
01:31:58,914 --> 01:32:00,194
No, it's yours.

1574
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:02,914
I cannot accept
another warrior's trophy.

1575
01:32:03,034 --> 01:32:04,194
Courtney, take my dick.

1576
01:32:04,314 --> 01:32:05,954
With pleasure, sir.

1577
01:32:06,074 --> 01:32:08,354
Till we meet again.

1578
01:32:25,274 --> 01:32:27,514
Is thou all right, brother?

1579
01:32:49,194 --> 01:32:51,514
I love you.

1580
01:32:51,634 --> 01:32:54,074
I love you, too.

1581
01:33:04,234 --> 01:33:05,954
They're cheering for you.

1582
01:33:06,074 --> 01:33:07,914
They're cheering for all of us.

1583
01:33:08,034 --> 01:33:09,874
Even for me?

1584
01:33:09,994 --> 01:33:12,714
Especially you, brother.

1585
01:33:31,794 --> 01:33:33,834
I'm proud of you, son.

1586
01:33:33,954 --> 01:33:35,834
You saved the entire land.

1587
01:33:35,954 --> 01:33:37,674
Not a bad run for a first quest.

1588
01:33:37,794 --> 01:33:40,434
Well, I would be remiss
to say I did it alone.

1589
01:33:40,554 --> 01:33:43,234
Fabious did help where he could.

1590
01:33:43,554 --> 01:33:45,754
I'm sure.

1591
01:33:56,954 --> 01:34:00,314
Finally. Alone.

1592
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:10,434
Hello, there. Cock-a-doodle-do.

1593
01:34:10,554 --> 01:34:12,154
Ah, Isabel.

1594
01:34:12,274 --> 01:34:13,314
Brother?

1595
01:34:13,434 --> 01:34:14,674
Yes?

1596
01:34:14,794 --> 01:34:16,114
Am I interrupting something?

1597
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:18,274
Nothing, I was preparing for bedtime

1598
01:34:18,394 --> 01:34:20,914
and just looking at the oils
that Father gave me.

1599
01:34:21,034 --> 01:34:23,394
I know what you're doing!

1600
01:34:23,514 --> 01:34:25,394
No, you don't.

1601
01:34:26,114 --> 01:34:28,594
Well, seeing you by yourself
at the wedding didn't seem right.

1602
01:34:28,714 --> 01:34:31,554
So, I've brought you someone:

1603
01:34:31,674 --> 01:34:33,594
- Someone I know you've been missing...
- Isabel?

1604
01:34:33,714 --> 01:34:35,794
...and who's been missing you.

1605
01:34:35,914 --> 01:34:38,874
I brought you Steven!

1606
01:34:39,994 --> 01:34:42,794
I went on a mini-quest
and I found him for you.

1607
01:34:42,914 --> 01:34:46,434
Well, that was

1608
01:34:47,274 --> 01:34:49,434
very nice of you, Fabious.
Thank you.

1609
01:34:49,554 --> 01:34:51,914
I had so much fun on
our adventure together.

1610
01:34:52,034 --> 01:34:55,994
Yes, I know.
You have told me 15 fucking times now.

1611
01:34:56,594 --> 01:34:58,554
Well...

1612
01:34:58,674 --> 01:35:01,034
I'm off to sleep
with Belladonna.

1613
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:02,154
I'm a little nervous.

1614
01:35:02,274 --> 01:35:03,274
Don't be.

1615
01:35:03,394 --> 01:35:06,114
Just swing your cock with the
same strength you swing your sword,

1616
01:35:06,234 --> 01:35:08,834
and I'm sure all will be fine.

1617
01:35:09,154 --> 01:35:12,154
All right.
Sweet dreams, brother.

1618
01:35:12,274 --> 01:35:14,994
Sweet dreams.

1619
01:35:15,234 --> 01:35:17,234
Steven.

1620
01:35:17,354 --> 01:35:21,674
Well, I'm going to put you in the
corner now while I strum my filthies.

1621
01:35:21,794 --> 01:35:24,514
Come, come, Steven.

1622
01:35:25,594 --> 01:35:28,314
Here we go.

1623
01:35:30,314 --> 01:35:31,634
Isabel.

1624
01:35:31,754 --> 01:35:35,234
I was able to wrap things up
in the west quicker than I expected.

1625
01:35:35,354 --> 01:35:37,514
I've not been able to
stop thinking of you.

1626
01:35:37,634 --> 01:35:41,794
What a coincidence. I was just
about to finish thinking of you.

1627
01:35:48,674 --> 01:35:51,354
Wait. Before we go any further,

1628
01:35:51,474 --> 01:35:52,714
there's something
I have to show you.

1629
01:35:52,834 --> 01:35:55,194
What?

1630
01:35:55,314 --> 01:35:56,794
What the hell is that?

1631
01:35:56,914 --> 01:35:58,274
It's a chastity belt

1632
01:35:58,394 --> 01:36:01,034
put upon me by an evil witch
long ago.

1633
01:36:01,154 --> 01:36:03,994
She now roams the
snow mountains of Shahmir.

1634
01:36:04,114 --> 01:36:05,434
If I can defeat her,

1635
01:36:05,554 --> 01:36:08,714
the curse will be broken,
the belt will fall free.

1636
01:36:08,834 --> 01:36:09,994
So in order for us to make love,

1637
01:36:10,114 --> 01:36:13,794
we have to track down an evil and,
I'm assuming, dangerous witch?

1638
01:36:13,914 --> 01:36:16,154
Exactly.

1639
01:36:20,034 --> 01:36:22,034
We would have to do this
right now?

1640
01:36:22,154 --> 01:36:23,594
If you don't want to join me,

1641
01:36:23,714 --> 01:36:26,234
I could just take care
of it myself.

1642
01:36:26,354 --> 01:36:29,234
No, of course I want to come.
We just got home.

1643
01:36:29,354 --> 01:36:30,594
I was hoping to have a few hours

1644
01:36:30,714 --> 01:36:32,634
of just doing nothing,
perhaps just relaxing.

1645
01:36:32,754 --> 01:36:35,754
Let's just stay here and snuggle.

1646
01:36:37,034 --> 01:36:41,114
No, fuck it.
Let's kill that bitch.

1647
01:36:41,394 --> 01:37:06,634
