1
00:00:12,523 --> 00:00:14,310
Clear and holster your safe weapon.

2
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:16,924
When your weapon is safe,
raise your hand.

3
00:00:18,828 --> 00:00:21,562
The line is safe.
Remove your eyes and ears.

4
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:24,231
Bring your targets up-range.
Watch your heads.

5
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,096
Police your brass.

6
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:31,885
Bring your targets up
for requalification.

7
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,846
You can frame this if you want,

8
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:41,248
you know, for younger
generations to marvel.

9
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:44,952
- Detective Lindsay, right?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:47,355
- From Intelligence?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:50,341
You got a new guy, Kenny Rixton?

12
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,510
Yeah.

13
00:00:52,578 --> 00:00:54,245
Watch your back.

14
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:56,940
We got to roll. How'd you do?

15
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:59,064
Uh...

16
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:00,851
Son of a bitch.

17
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,287
Congratulations.

18
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:04,755
You both passed re-qual.

19
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:07,591
- Stay safe out there.
- Thank you.

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,861
- Um...
- Erin, we gotta go.

21
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:36,954
- But it's all we have.
- Thanks.

22
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:37,988
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

23
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,490
Body inside the house.

24
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:40,925
Or, you know, what's left of it.

25
00:01:40,993 --> 00:01:43,928
Reynolds is the LGBT home next door.

26
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:47,431
- LGBT stands for Lesbian...
- I know what it stands for.

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,300
Okay. Everyone in there was evacuated

28
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:52,002
to the school basement,
which is down the block.

29
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,538
- Okay. Thanks.
- Yeah.

30
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:04,248
- Sergeant.
- Randy.

31
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,485
Another day at the office, huh?

32
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:11,288
Yeah. These natural gas
explosions are no joke.

33
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:13,457
I've seen one take out
half a city block.

34
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:15,993
Any indication how it happened?

35
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:18,996
Gas flex hose was removed
from the kitchen wall,

36
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:22,166
so looking like this was intentional.

37
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:23,734
Hm.

38
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:30,307
Okay, so what did Rixton do?

39
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:32,076
Guy didn't say.

40
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,545
What? They got to know.

41
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:36,781
Where's Rixton now?

42
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:39,016
He's in the back of the house.

43
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,685
Guys, I'm just saying
let's not go on the warpath

44
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:44,369
until we know what happened,
if anything.

45
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,341
You're right.

46
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:55,266
Paint thinner. Could be the accelerant.

47
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:58,536
CFD says there were two more
like it in the basement.

48
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:00,388
Your guys at the gang unit must be proud

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,541
with you making the jump
over to Intelligence.

50
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:05,309
Yeah. Yeah, they are.

51
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:06,777
Why?

52
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:12,016
Hey! Hey! Over here!

53
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,756
- He's alive!
- Medics, trauma victim.

54
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:21,992
Delta side in the gangway.
Board, collar, jump bag, now!

55
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:23,728
- Copy that.
- Okay, ready?

56
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:25,796
Lift! You're gonna be okay.

57
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:27,598
Help's on the way. Just hang on.

58
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:30,901
Just hang on.

59
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:36,430
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

60
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,636
All right, the tenant
is Dan Llewellyn, 35.

61
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:41,810
He's a contractor.

62
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:43,330
Now, we didn't find a cell phone

63
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,399
anywhere on the body or on the property.

64
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:47,734
All calls to Llewellyn's cell
have gone unanswered,

65
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:49,569
and we can't get a signal location.

66
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:51,004
We've reached out to his family.

67
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:52,606
Body's at the M.E.'s office right now.

68
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,708
They're trying to track
for dental and DNA.

69
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,344
Preliminary report says
we got a male, 6'2 ", maybe 6'3."

70
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:58,445
That matches Llewellyn's height.

71
00:03:58,514 --> 00:03:59,680
All right, and the other victim?

72
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:01,415
Was he from that LGBT home?

73
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:03,283
Yeah, he's at Med.
I'm trying to get an ID,

74
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:05,919
but the home's director says all
their kids are accounted for.

75
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:07,954
All right, Atwater,
you and Rixton head over to Med.

76
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:09,890
I want you there
when he's ready to talk.

77
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,458
And have his clothes sent to the lab.

78
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:12,726
Have them checked for accelerant.

79
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:13,894
He may be our firebug.

80
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,630
CFD says we're not looking
at a trained arsonist.

81
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:18,632
All right, the rest of you...
fire's an easy way

82
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,034
to execute a homicide or cover one up.

83
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:22,269
Let's figure out which

84
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:25,428
and why we got two bodies at the
same place at the same time.

85
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:26,889
What do we have on the building's owner?

86
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,381
Fred Teague. He's got six
properties on the south side,

87
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,287
and he's been dancing on and off
with the city's

88
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:34,181
Troubled Building Unit
for the last few years.

89
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:36,082
Copy that. And he's downstairs.

90
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,584
Hit it.

91
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,152
Okay.

92
00:04:41,023 --> 00:04:43,123
- That's convenient.
- Mmm.

93
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:51,198
Talked to a guy who I trust.

94
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:53,433
He said indictments are
being handed down

95
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,434
to Rixton's old unit.

96
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,769
Seriously? For what?

97
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,238
I don't know. He didn't say.

98
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:00,874
So, what? Rixton bailed
on a sinking ship?

99
00:05:00,943 --> 00:05:02,876
Yeah, or Voigt threw him
a life preserver.

100
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,379
I mean, what are we all supposed to do?

101
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:08,582
Just wait around for IAD to handle it?

102
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,885
'Cause I figure if his old unit is bent,

103
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:13,119
what kind of cop is he?

104
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,955
What do we even know about this guy,

105
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,903
aside from the fact
that Voigt rubber-stamped him?

106
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:21,238
I'm gonna call Antonio.

107
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,796
I mean, if indictments are coming down,

108
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,698
- he's gonna know about them.
- Yeah.

109
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:30,971
I just came from the house.

110
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,473
That was the first rental
I bought, 18 years ago.

111
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,541
Can you believe that?

112
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:37,043
What was your relationship
like with the tenant,

113
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:38,148
Dan Llewellyn?

114
00:05:38,314 --> 00:05:39,613
Frosty.

115
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:42,783
I mean, rest his soul, but...

116
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,361
what a royal pain in the ass.

117
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:46,660
How so?

118
00:05:46,754 --> 00:05:48,422
Dan was looking to break his lease,

119
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,457
move in with his girlfriend.

120
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:51,959
But he had eight months left.

121
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:54,861
- What was her name?
- Vivica something.

122
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,863
You got a couple of properties
with code violations.

123
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:58,229
I fixed all those.

124
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:01,535
And the house from this morning
was 100% up to code.

125
00:06:01,604 --> 00:06:04,338
Yeah, except you took out extra
insurance on it two months ago.

126
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,839
I was doing work on the building,

127
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,941
and the extra insurance is

128
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,977
because there was gonna be
people on site.

129
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:12,646
All right, so where were you
this morning, Mr. Teague?

130
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:15,916
I had a meeting
with a painter across town.

131
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:23,557
Are you guys seriously looking
at me for torching my own place?

132
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:26,493
You're not talking us out of it.

133
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:28,362
Maybe Dan lit the place

134
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,230
so he didn't have to pay rent
the rest of the year,

135
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,299
and he torched his own ass
in the process.

136
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:33,934
Maybe.

137
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:37,804
Name and number of the painter you met.

138
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:43,744
Dan will screw me yet from the grave.

139
00:06:43,812 --> 00:06:45,479
He'll screw me.

140
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,672
- Sarge.
- Hmm?

141
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:53,053
We got a homeless guy
ranting and raving outside.

142
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,430
So get rid of him.

143
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,557
Uh, yeah, love to, but CPD's
new de-escalation protocol

144
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,594
means I got to contact
my immediate supervisor ASAP,

145
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:03,330
so... it is what it is.

146
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:09,036
It's about my dog.
She's been gone all this time.

147
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:10,949
And no one can find her.

148
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:12,939
And I looked. I did. I did.

149
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:15,074
And so... so what help are you?

150
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:18,045
What I'm asking... right? Right?
'Cause Jupiter... Jupiter...

151
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:19,546
That's what planet he's on.

152
00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:20,914
You have a dog missing, sir?

153
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,949
Dog. My dog. Thank you.

154
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:25,619
Why is no one looking?
Looking? 'Cause Jupiter...

155
00:07:25,688 --> 00:07:27,754
H-his name is Jupiter?

156
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,523
Marvin. My name's Marvin.

157
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:31,758
Okay, Marvin, we're gonna
walk inside where it's warm,

158
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,093
and we're gonna get you
something to eat,

159
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:34,895
and maybe make a few calls... Ow!

160
00:07:34,963 --> 00:07:36,296
Ow!

161
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:38,732
What's in your pocket, Marvin?

162
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:42,369
Look at me.
Marvin, what's in your pocket?

163
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:44,104
Needle.

164
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,773
What's in the needle, Marvin?
Are you shooting up?

165
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,809
My dog is gone.

166
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:50,711
You didn't pat him down?
You didn't search him?

167
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,612
- What are you, a rookie?
- No, no, he comes up and I...

168
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,915
Tell Commander Crowley
I'll have an Exposure Report

169
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:56,316
when I get back from Med.

170
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:57,617
But get him inside,

171
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,952
search him properly,

172
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,455
and get his info.

173
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,789
All right, come on.

174
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:06,827
We just finished unpacking last night.

175
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:09,096
Why do you want to know about Dan?

176
00:08:09,164 --> 00:08:10,197
Have you spoken to him today?

177
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,966
Not since this morning.
He left at, like, 5:30.

178
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,469
Do you know where his job was
or the name of his firm?

179
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,804
He's self-employed. He's
doing a remodel across town,

180
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:18,939
but I don't have the address.

181
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:20,474
What's going on?

182
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,610
Vivica, there was a fire
at his old place

183
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:26,613
early this morning,
and somebody got caught in it.

184
00:08:26,682 --> 00:08:28,148
Someone died?

185
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,018
Oh, my God. Was it Dan?

186
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:32,938
We don't know yet.

187
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,421
How can you not know?

188
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,641
The condition of the body.

189
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:44,097
That's him. He was wearing
a blue shirt, grey sweater.

190
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,633
He's tall. Like 6'3".

191
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:48,802
No. No.

192
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:50,137
No. Where's the body?

193
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:52,539
- At the medical examiner's.
- I'll go. I'll know if I look...

194
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:55,142
You don't want to see the body, ma'am.

195
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:01,381
Patient's name is Kyle Harvey.

196
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,850
Dr. Rhodes is coming down.

197
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,719
- Great. Thank you.
- Appreciate that.

198
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:08,293
Uh... so, dog,

199
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:10,988
you still keep up with buddies
from your old unit?

200
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:16,496
Why is everyone suddenly
so interested in my old unit?

201
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:17,859
I'ma keep it real with you, man.

202
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:20,578
We heard about some
indictments coming down, and...

203
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:23,113
I just want a little clarification.

204
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:25,172
Yeah, well, you know,
you're not an active cop

205
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,029
unless you got a beef on you.

206
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:30,477
Yeah, well, indictment's a little
different from beef, but okay.

207
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:31,545
Hey, fellas.

208
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:33,914
So, I'm sorry, but your victim
was triple zeroes

209
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:34,848
when he came in.

210
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:36,944
We did everything we could, but he died

211
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:39,390
of massive blunt force trauma
from the explosion.

212
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:41,369
Thanks, Doc. Think you could
send those clothes

213
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,410
to the lab for us?

214
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:43,971
- You got it.
- Thanks.

215
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,428
Did you know Kyle?

216
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:51,565
I'm Angie McCallister, from Reynolds,

217
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,600
the LGBT home next door.

218
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:55,902
Kyle was one of ours.

219
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:04,945
Kyle was released two weeks ago.

220
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:07,113
His mother passed away a year ago.

221
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:09,082
He and his father were always at odds.

222
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,184
Six months ago,
he tried to take his own life,

223
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:13,587
and he was placed with us.

224
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,255
We'd been working with Kyle and his dad.

225
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:18,437
They'd come so far.

226
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:22,963
Yeah. Um, did you have any
issue with the tenant next door?

227
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:25,165
Dan? No.

228
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:27,467
He was a great guy.

229
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:30,537
He fixed things around the house.

230
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:32,139
He was really nice to the kids.

231
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:36,176
And some people in the neighborhood
just weren't as welcoming, you know?

232
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:39,379
He stood up for our kids.

233
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:43,550
Did he stand up to anybody
in particular?

234
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:46,553
One guy, yeah.

235
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:50,760
Like, two weeks ago,
he and Dan got into a fight.

236
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,307
The M.E. says no dental work

237
00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:56,863
or recent surgeries on our victim.

238
00:10:56,932 --> 00:10:59,099
Canvass says it may have happened
too early for witnesses.

239
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:02,836
No neighbors saw or heard
anything until the explosion.

240
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:05,005
Hey, Sarge, um,

241
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:08,074
we gotta ask you about Rixton.

242
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:09,643
What about him?

243
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,046
We heard that indictments were
being handed down in his old unit.

244
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:15,982
What does that have to do with you?

245
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:21,988
I want to know who's got my back.

246
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:25,859
Jeez. I imagine Kenny'd like
to know who has his as well.

247
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:28,094
You'd think that impending
indictments would be something

248
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:29,729
that he might, you know, offer up to us.

249
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:30,931
I know I would.

250
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:34,067
So you question a guy that I
brought in and vouched for

251
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:36,436
instead of working a case
that killed two people?

252
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:38,491
I can do both
at the same time. Trust me.

253
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,242
Dan Llewellyn stood up
for a few gay teens

254
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:43,743
a week and a half ago...

255
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:46,450
Punched a grown bully who was
threatening them. Harlan Betts.

256
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:49,083
Betts left, but pissed.

257
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:51,114
You and Erin.

258
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,793
Hmm.

259
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:04,764
The guy punched me,
and I'm the one in hot water?

260
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,002
Why don't you go arrest him?

261
00:12:06,088 --> 00:12:08,969
Maybe because you're the one
that likes to taunt teenagers.

262
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:10,112
Does that make you feel tough?

263
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,639
I got a kid, okay?
She looks out the window,

264
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,574
sees two guys kissing.

265
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:16,276
What kind of example is that?

266
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:19,813
What kind of example is it
you attacking them?

267
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:21,081
I didn't attack anyone.

268
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:24,050
He hit me. Why am I here?

269
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,988
Because somebody set his house
on fire with him in it.

270
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:32,292
I'm sorry. Do you find that funny?

271
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:35,595
Karma's a bitch, huh?

272
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:37,731
Two people were killed in that blast,

273
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,661
and one of them was a teenager
from Reynolds, so what happened?

274
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:41,005
Did he kiss another kid in front of you?

275
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:42,947
You decided to teach him a lesson?

276
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:44,455
Nope.

277
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:50,111
I'm warning you:

278
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:52,647
lose the grin,
or I will lose it for you.

279
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,153
You're gonna want to see this.

280
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:10,267
Hit it.

281
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:13,133
Dan Llewellyn, tenant from 3507 Wallace.

282
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:14,935
He's alive. He's okay.

283
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:19,039
Then... who the hell died in that fire?

284
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,320
Did I hear right
that someone from next door

285
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:31,398
got killed in the blast?

286
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,648
- That is right.
- Who?

287
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:35,805
His name was Kyle Harvey.

288
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:38,040
- Oh, man.
- So you knew him?

289
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,443
Yeah. He was trying to patch
things up with his dad.

290
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:42,211
How well did you know him?

291
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,314
He'd come around sometimes. We'd talk.

292
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:47,049
When's the last time
you were at the house, Dan?

293
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,352
A week and a half ago. I took everything

294
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,655
but the heavy stuff
I was gonna sell online.

295
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:54,084
Can you think of anyone
who might've had it out for you?

296
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:55,677
Yeah. The landlord.

297
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:56,993
Well, he alibied out.

298
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,362
Yeah, well, maybe he hired one
of his illegal immigrant workers

299
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:00,807
he pays 2 bucks an hour.

300
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:01,931
That could be.

301
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,713
All right, Dan,
I'm gonna posit a scenario

302
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,127
that any objective person
would eventually arrive at.

303
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:08,971
Torching the place is one way

304
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,907
of getting out of paying
the rest of your lease.

305
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,976
Yeah, it is. But that's not my style.

306
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,945
I already reached out to a buddy
of mine getting into real estate

307
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,947
to see if he could find me a subletter.

308
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:21,050
- His name?
- Corey Kipton. He teaches yoga

309
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,453
until the real estate thing
kicks in full-time.

310
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:25,722
So where were you this morning?

311
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,424
On this new job. I was working
in a basement all morning.

312
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,061
Walked out to grab a smoke,
and my phone lit up

313
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,762
with messages and missed calls.

314
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,928
Anybody confirm that?

315
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,000
Me.

316
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:39,969
You know, Kyle wasn't staying
at Reynolds House.

317
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:42,004
Why do you think he came back?

318
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:43,840
- What are you implying?
- Nothin'.

319
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:45,842
'Cause he was gay...

320
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,844
you implying me and Kyle
had a sexual relationship?

321
00:14:47,912 --> 00:14:49,078
- Did ya?
- No.

322
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:50,621
Okay.

323
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:52,308
What difference would it make if we did?

324
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:54,502
I'm just trying to figure out
what's goin' on.

325
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,491
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

326
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,693
Just having a conversation.

327
00:15:03,762 --> 00:15:06,095
Well, the conversation's over.

328
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,102
Jay.

329
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:17,646
- Sarge.
- Yeah?

330
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,841
People are starting to whisper

331
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,310
about what went down in the gang unit.

332
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,826
Don't say a word.

333
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:24,779
I wouldn't mind coming clean.

334
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:28,351
Keep your head in the case.
Don't say a word.

335
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:36,058
What the hell?
They won't buzz me up anymore?

336
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:38,060
Well, we told them
to keep the riffraff out.

337
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:44,200
- So?
- Whole thing's sealed up tight.

338
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:46,369
And I'm not on that case.

339
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:48,070
But you must have heard something.

340
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:49,906
Antonio, come on.

341
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:52,108
We have to work with this guy now.

342
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,511
I heard seven indictments
are coming down.

343
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:57,960
Rixton was in an eight-man unit.

344
00:15:58,052 --> 00:15:59,418
That's right.

345
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,147
So is Rixton the one
not getting indicted?

346
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:04,343
Correct.

347
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:07,023
If he wasn't rounded up,
maybe he didn't do anything.

348
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:10,987
Or he's walking because he
rolled on his entire team.

349
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:13,162
That's not my department.

350
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:18,770
Man... you miss us, though, right?

351
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:23,406
I cry myself to sleep every night.

352
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:25,174
Figured.

353
00:16:26,911 --> 00:16:29,779
We ran the man's name
with area hospitals.

354
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:33,950
The VA has him confirmed
with hepatitis C.

355
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:36,285
O-okay.

356
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,855
They're sending his full record now.

357
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:40,897
And we'll also check for HIV,

358
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:42,925
but that's just precautionary.

359
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:46,584
I mean, I barely got pricked.

360
00:16:47,077 --> 00:16:48,898
We'll keep a good thought, all right?

361
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,199
Thanks.

362
00:16:57,442 --> 00:16:59,508
Yeah, I've been studying
for my real estate license,

363
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:01,510
so renting houses
and apartments part-time.

364
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:04,180
Show the place to anybody 6'3" or so?

365
00:17:04,248 --> 00:17:06,015
Yeah, a guy walked in yesterday.

366
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:07,516
Does he have a name?

367
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:09,351
Uh, I think it was Bill something.

368
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,255
Couple of first names. John...
Bill Johns?

369
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,825
Anyway, he and his wife said they
wanted to move to the south side.

370
00:17:15,893 --> 00:17:17,079
He wanted the house right then.

371
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:18,243
Said he loved the red door.

372
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:20,208
Hey, how about a copy
of that application?

373
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:23,232
He offered me a thousand bucks
cash to hold the place.

374
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:25,901
Well, you should at least have
a phone number, right?

375
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,437
No. He said he was gonna call me today.

376
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:32,107
Does anybody else besides you
and Dan have a key to the place?

377
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,376
No idea. I just use the key

378
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:36,445
that Dan leaves under
the planter by the back door.

379
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,647
Did this Bill Johns
see where that key is hidden?

380
00:17:38,716 --> 00:17:41,584
Maybe. Probably.

381
00:17:41,652 --> 00:17:42,751
We good?

382
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,220
Yeah.

383
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:48,490
Your victim didn't die
from smoke inhalation

384
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,459
or blunt force trauma.

385
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,428
He was shot first.

386
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:55,464
A .22 fired into the eye socket
at close range.

387
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,900
- Okay.
- Any marks to help us ID him?

388
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:00,669
Too far gone for birthmarks or tattoos.

389
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,538
But I do have a wedding ring.

390
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,975
Congrats on moving up to Intelligence.

391
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,509
I've been meaning to tell you that.

392
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:08,614
Thank you.

393
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:11,224
And that super nice guy
you were engaged to, Adam Ruzek?

394
00:18:11,286 --> 00:18:12,708
Is he still there?

395
00:18:12,837 --> 00:18:16,238
Uh, no. He's... no.

396
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,755
Ah, because of you?

397
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:22,358
- Can we move on?
- Of course.

398
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:23,626
Great.

399
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:25,294
No inscription,

400
00:18:25,363 --> 00:18:27,763
nothing out of the ordinary to track it.

401
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:30,299
And his watch.

402
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:31,700
Victim fell on his arm.

403
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:33,502
It wouldn't have survived otherwise.

404
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,305
Breguet, vintage.
I have a reference number,

405
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:38,374
movement serial number, and case number.

406
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:42,645
18 jewels, high-quality
manual wind mechanism.

407
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:45,335
Sorry. My second husband was obsessed.

408
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:49,648
Shame about the fire. This was a beauty.

409
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:50,709
You sold it?

410
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:51,971
I checked my records after your call.

411
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:53,322
Sold it a year and a half ago.

412
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:55,219
To a Bill Johns? William Johns?

413
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:58,208
No. A Jane Framingham?

414
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:01,981
And this watch is 12 grand?

415
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:04,283
It's a deal for what she got.
Mint condition,

416
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,352
authenticated original box
and service papers.

417
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,787
It was an anniversary gift.

418
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,489
She say anything about the husband?

419
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,292
No. Did she kill him?

420
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,994
Did she say she was gonna kill him?

421
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:16,862
God, no. Don't mind me.

422
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:18,664
I read too many thrillers.

423
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,683
This is the most excitement
I've had all year.

424
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:26,305
Mrs. Framingham, we found the watch

425
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,274
on a body earlier this morning.

426
00:19:28,342 --> 00:19:30,476
The man died in a house fire.

427
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,343
In New York?

428
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,830
My husband's travelling there
on business.

429
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:36,832
Is... is that where this happened?

430
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:39,034
The south side of Chicago.

431
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:41,553
We believe the man's name
was Bill Johns.

432
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:44,229
He was wearing this watch
and a wedding ring.

433
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:48,727
I don't understand.
Why would a dead man in Chicago

434
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,955
be wearing my husband's watch and ring?

435
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:59,540
Curt and I talked
on the phone last night.

436
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,040
He calls every night
when he's travelling.

437
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:04,376
- He called you from New York?
- Yes.

438
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:07,012
I mean, that's where he said he was.

439
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:11,667
The body that you found, it's...

440
00:20:11,735 --> 00:20:13,502
it's definitely him?

441
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:17,473
The real estate agent
confirmed from your photograph

442
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,708
that he showed your husband
that house yesterday.

443
00:20:19,777 --> 00:20:23,045
Do you have any idea why he'd be
using the name Bill Johns?

444
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:25,314
No.

445
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:27,049
Why did he say he was in New York?

446
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:29,718
He's a trader. His company's
at the Board of Trade.

447
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:32,454
He travels east all the time, or...

448
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,691
Did he ever mention a house
at 3507 South Wallace?

449
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,392
Or moving?

450
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:41,029
He always wanted
to paint our front door red.

451
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,101
Maybe it was a... a surprise?

452
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,374
Were you guys having any problems?

453
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:54,576
No.

454
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:57,346
We were good.

455
00:20:57,414 --> 00:21:00,649
Or, I... I thought we were.

456
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,385
Could there have been
someone else in his life?

457
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,223
Well, I don't know anything, do I?

458
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:18,142
Curt Framingham worked for Metro
Gold Central for five years.

459
00:21:18,324 --> 00:21:19,642
No employment before here,

460
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:21,737
and no Curt Framingham
in Chicago before that.

461
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:24,661
There's no Curt or Curtis
Framingham countrywide.

462
00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:29,125
Not in Lexus Nexus,
Face of the Nation, social media.

463
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:32,321
However, we ran a multistate
DMV facial recognition

464
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,616
and popped a match for Curt Forrester.

465
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:36,719
- Kevin, would you be so kind?
- Yes, ma'am.

466
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:39,525
Great. So, Curt Forrester,
AKA Curt Framingham,

467
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:43,592
was arrested in Indianapolis in
2010 for running a Ponzi scheme.

468
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,461
He funneled client savings to
these money-losing businesses

469
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,897
to line his own pockets
with finder's fees.

470
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:51,967
The SEC lost the case when
a key witness died during trial.

471
00:21:52,035 --> 00:21:55,919
It was a boating accident.
Looks like an actual accident.

472
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:57,978
Hmm. Call HIDTA.

473
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:00,622
Run a deconfliction report
on Curt Framingham

474
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:01,896
and on Metro Gold Capital.

475
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:04,380
Let's see if the Feds are into this guy.

476
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:07,427
I got a guy at the Fed who
gets me whatever I want to know.

477
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:09,117
You want me to call him?

478
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:11,253
We're good.

479
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:20,043
Someone want to fill me in
on the office gossip?

480
00:22:20,113 --> 00:22:22,631
Um... your gang unit pulled indictments

481
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,766
for everyone but you, so...

482
00:22:24,835 --> 00:22:27,569
why don't you tell us
how you worked that out?

483
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,822
Well, maybe there was nothing to indict.

484
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,828
Seven guys taken in, and one
in the clear? That happens.

485
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:35,460
You wanna say something? Say it.

486
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:36,561
I think I just did.

487
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:38,613
I mean, there's only
a couple options, right?

488
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:40,666
I mean, either you're dirty
and you got away with it,

489
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,730
or you worked a deal.
I think we just want to know...

490
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,836
You wrote parking tickets
for two years to get up here,

491
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,936
and you're gonna lecture me?

492
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:48,592
Come talk to me after you work
seven years on the front lines.

493
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:52,153
There a problem?

494
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:55,144
No, Sergeant.

495
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:56,565
Well, that's good,

496
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,083
'cause if I hear one more person
talk about anything

497
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,171
other than this case and the
two people who were killed,

498
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:05,078
I'll put you on the next transfer order.

499
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,866
Try me.

500
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:23,759
- Hey.
- Hi.

501
00:23:23,827 --> 00:23:26,361
I, uh, I notified Commander Crawley,

502
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,796
and Marvin's in holding.

503
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,490
Holding? You had him arrested?

504
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,310
Yeah. Injury was sustained
during a struggle with a police officer.

505
00:23:32,342 --> 00:23:33,802
That's an IOD, right?

506
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,946
We got a guy without a home
in February in Chicago

507
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,540
who just lost his dog,

508
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:39,775
and you're gonna arrest him?

509
00:23:39,843 --> 00:23:42,744
By arresting him, it meant we could
run a mandatory blood draw.

510
00:23:42,813 --> 00:23:44,112
You compare that with your tests at Med.

511
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:46,081
I just thought...

512
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,516
Oh, yeah.

513
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,085
Good move.

514
00:23:50,154 --> 00:23:51,787
What about the dog?

515
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,690
Seriously still worried about the dog?

516
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,798
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

517
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:03,920
I'm sorry.

518
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:06,134
We're still looking
for your dog, Marvin.

519
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:10,319
J-Jupiter took my-my-my dog.
He n-never came back.

520
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:11,907
Jupiter's your friend?

521
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:13,842
Jupiter went to a home.

522
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,410
Uh-huh. What's your dog's name?

523
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:16,845
Rosie. Rosie!

524
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,052
What color is she?

525
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:21,110
Red. Red. Red.

526
00:24:21,185 --> 00:24:22,771
- Okay.
- Red.

527
00:24:22,873 --> 00:24:25,140
We're working on getting you
outta here real soon, Marvin.

528
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:30,459
So, tell me: what do the Feds
have on Curt Framingham?

529
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:32,529
We made the connection
between Forrester and Framingham

530
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,695
four months ago.

531
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,537
- So, why didn't you pick him up?
- You know the AUSA's office.

532
00:24:36,615 --> 00:24:39,568
They want a 99% chance the guy's
going away before we grab him.

533
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:41,936
We were finalizing the paperwork
with the company.

534
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:43,293
Now how much had he skimmed?

535
00:24:43,345 --> 00:24:45,478
Over 300 grand into personal accounts.

536
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:48,120
But the company was looking
at over 3 million in losses.

537
00:24:48,317 --> 00:24:50,446
Could one of his investors have
figured it out and killed him?

538
00:24:50,504 --> 00:24:51,512
Unlikely.

539
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:54,929
Metro Gold covered their accounts
before any client looked twice.

540
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:56,561
List of his clients.

541
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:58,729
You ever hear about him
using the name Bill Johns

542
00:24:58,785 --> 00:25:00,846
for anything... William Johns?

543
00:25:01,143 --> 00:25:04,559
Ballistics got a match. Gun's a .22
registered to Roxanne Cabrera.

544
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,425
Roxanne Cabrera on your list?

545
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,609
Nah.

546
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:08,758
We've got an address.

547
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:10,804
- All right, Rixton and Atwater.
- Yeah.

548
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:16,672
Sorry. I broke my ankle
in a car accident last night.

549
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,804
I was in the hospital.

550
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:20,445
Oh, no. I'm sorry to hear that.
When did you get home?

551
00:25:20,544 --> 00:25:22,477
An hour ago. What is this about?

552
00:25:23,077 --> 00:25:25,280
Uh, Ms. Cabrera, you wouldn't happen

553
00:25:25,342 --> 00:25:26,581
to own a weapon, would you?

554
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,584
I have a gun. It's registered.

555
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,256
Okay. When's the last time you used it?

556
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:32,421
Two weeks ago. I went shooting
with some friends.

557
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,590
- Whose gear?
- My brother's.

558
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,291
The accident happened late last night.

559
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,459
He came to feed the cat.

560
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:38,827
Okay. What's your brother's name?

561
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:40,295
Rafael, but...

562
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:41,663
Same last name?

563
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:43,799
Yes. Whatever this is...

564
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:46,435
Your weapon was used
in a shooting this morning.

565
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,271
That's impossible.
I keep my gun locked in a safe

566
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,305
in the bedroom.

567
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:51,440
Bedroom's that way?

568
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,774
Yeah.

569
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:03,452
I... I put it there myself.

570
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,753
Okay. Step back, ma'am.

571
00:26:04,822 --> 00:26:06,488
Uh, let's call Forensics
for prints, bro.

572
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:07,489
Something else first.

573
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:09,718
Your brother, Rafael...
has he been in trouble?

574
00:26:09,766 --> 00:26:12,242
Not since he moved here from Florida.

575
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,918
Assault with a deadly weapon,
self-admitted gang member.

576
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,834
Rafi was here last night with my fiancé.

577
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:21,436
- What's your fiancé's name?
- Bill Johns.

578
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,172
Perfect.

579
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,056
How long have you been seeing Bill?

580
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,305
Six months.

581
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:34,074
He tell you what he did for a living?

582
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:35,329
Finance.

583
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:36,877
He tell you he was married before?

584
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:38,645
Married still?

585
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:39,813
No.

586
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:41,648
We love each other.

587
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:43,894
We're moving into a new house together.

588
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,558
And why do you keep talking
about him in the past tense?

589
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,591
Take a wild guess.

590
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:55,629
He's dead?

591
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:00,867
Bill wasn't even his name.
He was Curt Framingham.

592
00:27:00,936 --> 00:27:02,569
Before that, Curt Forrester.

593
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:04,738
He's got a wife named Jane
in the suburbs.

594
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:06,940
- No.
- Yes.

595
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,310
Roxanne...

596
00:27:12,915 --> 00:27:15,649
Hey.

597
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,384
What happened?

598
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:25,025
The gun that killed
Curt Framingham belongs to you.

599
00:27:25,094 --> 00:27:28,013
And your brother was in your
house last night. He had access.

600
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,863
Rafi doesn't even know the combination.

601
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:31,765
It's 7-14-90. It's your birthday.

602
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:34,334
You don't think
he could figure that out?

603
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,703
Look. You found out Bill or Curt

604
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:38,872
or whatever he called himself
was married, you got angry.

605
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:41,007
- Any woman would.
- No!

606
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,511
Okay, your brother found out,
defended your honor.

607
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,918
Okay, where's Rafael?

608
00:27:54,022 --> 00:27:56,356
Where is Rafael?

609
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,759
Roxanne,

610
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:01,027
you got to be a big sister right now.

611
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,931
If we put out a manhunt, this is
gonna go a whole lot worse.

612
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,867
Just tell us where he is.

613
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:11,304
In class,

614
00:28:11,407 --> 00:28:12,806
at Chicago City College.

615
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:13,907
He's getting straight As.

616
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:15,442
He's working so hard.

617
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:17,744
I want to be there when you talk to him.

618
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:19,579
Sorry.

619
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,680
Okay.

620
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,724
Hey. There's a Jane Framingham
downstairs.

621
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,392
She asked to see you.

622
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:41,790
God.

623
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:43,904
I just keep running it over in my head.

624
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,728
Meeting Prince Charming,
falling in love.

625
00:28:45,788 --> 00:28:48,197
Guy who has money, doesn't want mine.

626
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:51,945
The house thing with the red door...

627
00:28:52,014 --> 00:28:54,781
that was for another woman, wasn't it?

628
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,016
Mrs. Framingham...

629
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,919
Is she pretty? Younger?

630
00:29:00,923 --> 00:29:02,923
Both.

631
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,991
Did she kill him?

632
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,294
I mean, just... maybe there's
some justice in this world.

633
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:09,930
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

634
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,533
I keep thinking
maybe if I wasn't so stupid...

635
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:15,469
Just tell me what you know.

636
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:17,971
Do you know that your husband
had another name

637
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,973
before he met you?

638
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:21,196
Forrester.

639
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:23,245
You're kidding me.

640
00:29:25,383 --> 00:29:27,800
You should start moving on.

641
00:29:27,885 --> 00:29:29,752
I've got to get back upstairs.

642
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:37,593
Well, your sister says
you and her fiancé were

643
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,561
at her place last night.

644
00:29:38,596 --> 00:29:40,680
Yeah. He stayed for an hour, then left.

645
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:42,848
What, so you followed him
back out to the suburbs,

646
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:45,401
see his big house, his wife?

647
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:46,852
What are you talking about?

648
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:50,022
You found out what he was
up to last night.

649
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:52,742
This morning, you went over to the place

650
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:54,243
he was gonna rent for your sister,

651
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:55,695
and you shot him in the face.

652
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,697
What? No.

653
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:59,582
Rafael, stop. Don't embarrass yourself.

654
00:29:59,617 --> 00:30:00,911
We know exactly what happened.

655
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:02,868
Doused him in paint thinner,
pulled the gas hose,

656
00:30:02,954 --> 00:30:04,587
went to class like nothing happened.

657
00:30:04,622 --> 00:30:05,921
Man, I would never do that.

658
00:30:05,957 --> 00:30:07,590
Sure you would. You already have.

659
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:10,760
Like that time in Florida
you took a baseball bat to a guy

660
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:12,962
'cause he tried to steal
a package off your porch.

661
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:15,381
No. I've changed. I didn't hurt Bill.

662
00:30:15,406 --> 00:30:16,641
All right, then explain it to us,

663
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,379
'cause you were the last
person with the guy.

664
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:21,303
You have motive, no alibi,
history of violence...

665
00:30:24,442 --> 00:30:26,776
Found it in the sister's
building storage. It's a .22.

666
00:30:26,811 --> 00:30:29,945
Serial number matches
the sister's registration.

667
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:31,731
Oops.

668
00:30:31,816 --> 00:30:33,866
Should've found a better hiding spot.

669
00:30:33,951 --> 00:30:35,317
Man, somebody set me up!

670
00:30:35,403 --> 00:30:36,952
I swear to God, I've changed.

671
00:30:36,988 --> 00:30:38,654
Well, you didn't change enough.

672
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,706
Get up. We're booking you for murder.

673
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:43,325
Get up. Let's go.

674
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:52,051
Hey. April from Med...

675
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:53,836
test came back negative for hepatitis.

676
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:55,838
Only insulin found on the needle.

677
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:58,756
Now, they still got to do
the blood drop on Marvin,

678
00:30:58,842 --> 00:31:00,810
but the VA reports from last week showed

679
00:31:00,845 --> 00:31:04,396
that hepatitis was his only
communicable disease,

680
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:07,900
so... you're in the clear.

681
00:31:17,912 --> 00:31:19,695
Oh...

682
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:24,500
Oh, my gosh.

683
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:27,086
Look at you. Who are you?

684
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:29,672
Oh, I don't believe it.

685
00:31:29,707 --> 00:31:33,008
Come on, little sweet thing.
Look at you.

686
00:31:33,044 --> 00:31:35,711
Look at your little face. Come on.

687
00:31:36,931 --> 00:31:40,516
Marvin? Marvin, I got a present for ya.

688
00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:43,769
Rosie!

689
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:45,855
You found my Rosie-Rosie!

690
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,524
Rosie! You found her.
You found my Rosie!

691
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,975
How did you... how did you find her?

692
00:31:50,061 --> 00:31:52,812
Well, I didn't do anything.
She found you.

693
00:31:52,897 --> 00:31:56,031
Jupiter took-took-took my dog,
and then he never...

694
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,950
never came back... never, never.

695
00:31:58,035 --> 00:31:59,535
Well, shame on Jupiter, then, huh?

696
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,571
"Jupiter wanted to go
to the home," the man asked.

697
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:04,573
Okay, well, we're gonna
get you out of here now, Marvin,

698
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:05,708
get you some help.

699
00:32:05,743 --> 00:32:06,959
J-Jupiter g-g-go to a home...

700
00:32:07,044 --> 00:32:08,961
he go to the home... he go... he go,

701
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:10,830
and then he always wanted to see...

702
00:32:10,915 --> 00:32:14,049
- Okay, up we go.
- With the big red door.

703
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:15,301
What did you say?

704
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:19,004
Jupiter always wanted to see
the house with the big red door.

705
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,006
The-the-the man showed him. He did.

706
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:23,926
He took my dog. He took my-my-my Rosie.

707
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:25,845
Jupiter took the dog with him

708
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,666
after a man offered to show him
a home with a big red door?

709
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,189
Is that when she went missing?

710
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:35,487
Why is your friend called Jupiter?

711
00:32:35,573 --> 00:32:37,940
Jupiter's the biggest of all planets.

712
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,693
How big is Jupiter?

713
00:32:42,947 --> 00:32:44,663
Sit tight, Marvin.

714
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:49,451
Hi, Rosie. Hi, Rosie.

715
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:54,817
The house that blew up with
your victim... it had a red door?

716
00:32:54,911 --> 00:32:56,825
- That's right.
- And the victim was 6'3"?

717
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,529
- Yeah.
- Who was he?

718
00:32:58,592 --> 00:33:00,642
Half a con artist living a double life.

719
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:02,725
Hank, I think you got the wrong guy.

720
00:33:07,598 --> 00:33:09,925
Marvin, is this the man
who approached you last night?

721
00:33:10,003 --> 00:33:11,089
You and your friend Jupiter?

722
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:14,293
I thought Jupiter had my dog.

723
00:33:14,356 --> 00:33:15,809
M-m-my dog Rosie.

724
00:33:15,886 --> 00:33:18,534
Okay, so you left together.
Do you know where?

725
00:33:19,194 --> 00:33:21,716
I thought Jupiter took my... my dog,

726
00:33:21,785 --> 00:33:23,950
so I followed... I followed Jupiter,

727
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,799
and then the man,
and then they went to the house

728
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:27,500
w-with the red door.

729
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:29,002
Is that the place?

730
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:32,222
That! Yes! The big red door!

731
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:33,840
The big red door!

732
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,644
Thank you. This really, really helps.

733
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,815
Jupiter okay? I'm not m-mad anymore.

734
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,149
I have Rosie back.

735
00:33:43,185 --> 00:33:44,818
Jupiter okay?

736
00:33:44,853 --> 00:33:46,770
Jupiter's okay.

737
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:52,859
Way to go, Marvin. You did real good.

738
00:33:57,499 --> 00:33:58,365
Hey, we got a hit on Framingham

739
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,200
at a car rental place
on Lake Park Avenue.

740
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:01,751
It's rented to a Curt Forrester.

741
00:34:01,837 --> 00:34:04,671
The same credit card was used at a
gas station on 94, heading north.

742
00:34:04,706 --> 00:34:06,006
Is he going to Canada?

743
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,842
And at a motel off 94, half an hour ago.

744
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:10,241
He's bunking down for the night.

745
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,163
All right, let's roll.
We're gonna get this bastard

746
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:14,047
before he skips town completely.

747
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:23,807
Room 125.

748
00:34:23,892 --> 00:34:26,026
124 isn't occupied, but 126 is.

749
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:28,194
All right, we'll stack at the door.

750
00:34:41,043 --> 00:34:42,575
Hands up! Get your hands up!

751
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:44,127
- Don't move!
- Hey! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

752
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:45,245
Jay...

753
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:49,082
Police! Keep your hands
where we can see them.

754
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,000
Get against the wall.
Against the wall, now!

755
00:34:51,086 --> 00:34:53,169
Against the wall.

756
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:57,757
Put your hands behind your back.

757
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:08,184
You totally had me fooled.

758
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,270
- All right, get her dressed.
- Sit down.

759
00:35:14,393 --> 00:35:16,109
Sit down.

760
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,035
Your husband...
is he actually your husband?

761
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:28,288
Your partner-in-crime?

762
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:30,090
He just lawyered up.

763
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,654
I want a lawyer as well.

764
00:35:31,759 --> 00:35:34,803
That's fine. We have plenty enough
to ring you up on as it is,

765
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:36,262
so you don't need to say anything,

766
00:35:36,298 --> 00:35:38,181
but you are gonna listen.

767
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:42,218
Leon Tremaine. Also known as Jupiter.

768
00:35:42,304 --> 00:35:45,855
He was a boxer who almost made
the Olympic team in 2000.

769
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:47,607
All the fighting gave him brain damage

770
00:35:47,642 --> 00:35:50,110
and turned him homeless.

771
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:52,729
He wandered to Chicago
all the way from Indiana.

772
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:54,948
He had just reconnected
with his daughter,

773
00:35:54,983 --> 00:35:59,619
who'd been looking for him
for ten years.

774
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:02,122
That's who your husband
put a bullet into.

775
00:36:02,157 --> 00:36:04,824
That's who you put a bullet into,

776
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,160
because you're gonna
get charged the same.

777
00:36:08,663 --> 00:36:10,964
Kyle Harvey was 18 years old.

778
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:13,166
He lost his mom right before
his dad kicked him out

779
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:15,218
of the house... twice,

780
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:17,170
and he was coming back to the only place

781
00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:18,472
that had ever treated him well

782
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:20,805
when he died in the fire
you guys rigged.

783
00:36:21,176 --> 00:36:23,009
That's how Kyle died.

784
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:26,813
Look at him.

785
00:36:26,848 --> 00:36:28,431
Look at him!

786
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:29,649
You're hurting me.

787
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:31,351
You don't know what hurting is.

788
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:33,353
Do you want me to show you?

789
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:36,189
I'd be happy to.
Just nod your head at me.

790
00:36:41,413 --> 00:36:43,112
You knew the Feds were closing in,

791
00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:46,249
so you decided to fake
your husband's funeral.

792
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:48,284
Well, guess what, sweetheart.

793
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,036
This is your funeral now.

794
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:05,888
Uh, hey, um,

795
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:10,440
I'd... I'd like to publicly apologize.

796
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:16,196
There were some whispers
and some gossip.

797
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:19,020
I ran with it,
and I shouldn't have, okay?

798
00:37:19,622 --> 00:37:22,223
You know, this... this whole nonsense...

799
00:37:22,317 --> 00:37:25,038
I was leading the charge on this.
I'm sorry, man.

800
00:37:25,216 --> 00:37:27,490
I had a bad experience
with a guy in my unit

801
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:28,875
when I was overseas,

802
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,842
who was not who he claimed to be.

803
00:37:30,923 --> 00:37:33,420
And that's my problem. That's not yours.

804
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:37,333
You're a solid dude, and a good cop,

805
00:37:37,419 --> 00:37:41,337
so whatever happened in the gang
unit doesn't matter, all right?

806
00:37:41,423 --> 00:37:43,967
Man to man, and to the whole team,

807
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,809
um, I'm sorry.

808
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:51,253
Yeah, you can count me in on that, too.

809
00:37:53,735 --> 00:37:54,901
My bad, dog.

810
00:37:56,822 --> 00:38:00,040
The sister of one of the
gang unit cops was beat up

811
00:38:00,075 --> 00:38:03,827
after she turned in a banger
for robbing her place.

812
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:06,296
ASA didn't have enough to
convict the guy who did it,

813
00:38:06,381 --> 00:38:08,665
so Rixton's unit went after him.

814
00:38:10,886 --> 00:38:13,922
But Kenny wasn't with them.

815
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:16,750
Two cars belonging
to other members of the unit

816
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:18,258
were spotted by plate readers

817
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,943
one block from where
the payback beating went down

818
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:23,868
at the same time it happened.

819
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,933
Oh, and one of those...

820
00:38:26,015 --> 00:38:28,682
one of those cars was approached
by a patrolman

821
00:38:28,854 --> 00:38:31,938
who was told they were
on a narcotics sting,

822
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:34,809
but they'd already clocked out.

823
00:38:35,944 --> 00:38:37,958
So it had to be a lie.

824
00:38:39,114 --> 00:38:41,948
That's how they got caught.
Not by anything Kenny did.

825
00:38:43,618 --> 00:38:46,169
I was approached by IAD,

826
00:38:46,237 --> 00:38:50,398
but turned down a deal,
and I never said a word.

827
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:52,414
Not that my unit believed me.

828
00:38:52,555 --> 00:38:54,195
Why didn't you just say that
in the first place?

829
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:57,641
Because I told him not to.
We were working a case.

830
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,970
Plus, his last unit iced him out
over a rumor.

831
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:02,886
I wanted to see if you guys
were any better.

832
00:39:04,423 --> 00:39:06,029
How did we do?

833
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,581
I'll see you at Molly's.

834
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:35,492
Adam.

835
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:41,601
Hey.

836
00:39:41,718 --> 00:39:43,843
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

837
00:39:44,012 --> 00:39:45,598
- I'm good.
- Good.

838
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,387
And... and the undercover assignment?

839
00:39:47,504 --> 00:39:50,066
It's over. Yeah.

840
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:53,738
Listen, uh...

841
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,586
I kind of ran from Intelligence.

842
00:39:58,193 --> 00:40:02,008
I'll admit I wasn't ready
to work side-by-side with you.

843
00:40:02,196 --> 00:40:03,797
It was stupid.

844
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:06,141
It's like my family up there.

845
00:40:06,485 --> 00:40:08,115
I'd really like to come back.

846
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:09,763
Okay.

847
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:12,922
- Is that okay with you?
- Yes.

848
00:40:13,008 --> 00:40:14,174
- You sure?
- Yes.

849
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:16,576
- Okay, 'cause that was kind of quick.
- Yes!

850
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,841
Welcome back.

851
