00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:08,334
Guys, this... is a dishwasher. Okay?

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,866
This is not a dishwasher.

3
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:15,405
We know what a dishwasher is.

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,765
Okay. Well, then, show me by
putting your dishes in there.

5
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:20,827
It's full of wine glasses.

6
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,107
When you have kids, you'll understand.

7
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:26,732
Come on.

8
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:28,641
(SIGHS)

9
00:00:28,643 --> 00:00:29,876
Hi.

10
00:00:29,878 --> 00:00:31,144
Hey.

11
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:32,812
- How was Bingo with your mom?
- (SHUDDERS)

12
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:37,984
(EXHALES)

13
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:39,218
How do you think it was?

14
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,853
Four hours stuck in a hot room

15
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:42,855
with a bunch of senior citizens.

16
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:46,826
And it took forever to call each number.

17
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:47,894
"B9."

18
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:49,195
(AS ELDERLY PERSON): "What?!"

19
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:51,431
"B9."

20
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:53,039
(AS ELDERLY PERSON): "What?!"

21
00:00:54,135 --> 00:00:58,171
And then this 90-year-old
woman grabbed my thigh.

22
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:01,841
And I said "Hey, hands
off" and she said "What?"

23
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:05,478
Well, you've always been
catnip for the blue hairs.

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,003
Yeah. Oh!

25
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:09,776
I did finally win a prize.

26
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:11,417
- (RATTLING)
- A pill organizer.

27
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:13,653
But I think it's used,

28
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:15,254
'cause there's an aspirin in Friday.

29
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:19,392
I'll put it with the compression
socks you won last week.

30
00:01:19,394 --> 00:01:21,260
(CHUCKLES)

31
00:01:21,262 --> 00:01:24,964
Ever since my mom got on this
Bingo kick, it's every week.

32
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:26,365
My dad won't take her,

33
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:28,101
you won't take her...

34
00:01:28,103 --> 00:01:30,536
Wait. Why don't you ever take her?

35
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:33,376
Well, I told her I don't like Bingo.

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,754
I may have also said that you love it.

37
00:01:41,428 --> 00:01:43,295
So you did this to me?

38
00:01:43,598 --> 00:01:45,136
Bingo.

39
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:48,375
Honey, you know, your mom is just

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,577
sitting around that house
all day with your dad.

41
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:52,769
She's probably bored out of her mind.

42
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,971
That's what it is!

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,340
Look at the big brain on you.

44
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:00,571
To stop Bingo at night,

45
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:03,647
we need to find a way to
tire her out during the day.

46
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:06,917
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

47
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,652
Don't you have volunteers
at the hospital?

48
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:10,620
Actually, your mom would love that.

49
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:13,790
Yeah. Why not give
her to the sick people?

50
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:18,351
They're already not having fun.

51
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:20,330
Okay, I'll get her signed up.

52
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:21,665
Great. Great.

53
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,667
Oh. And as a thank
you, please accept this

54
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,836
state-of-the-art bunion shaver.

55
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:27,904
- Ooh.
- Really?

56
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:33,325
I was on a hot streak.

57
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:39,316
Oh, I'm so nervous.

58
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:41,084
My first day as a volunteer.

59
00:02:41,086 --> 00:02:43,386
Hey. Dropped the kids off at school.

60
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:46,756
Uh, fair warning, Teddy lost
his hard-boiled egg in your car.

61
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:48,860
I moved the seat back to try to find it,

62
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:50,861
but I think I may have just crushed it.

63
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:52,743
Look at me, sweetie.

64
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:55,365
I'm a working girl,
like Mary Tyler Moore.

65
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,767
If I had a hat, I'd throw it in the air.

66
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,402
(CHUCKLING)

67
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:03,107
She knows she's not getting paid, right?

68
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:05,308
Hey, I took her off your
hands. Don't rock the boat.

69
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,277
All right, look. Just keep her moving

70
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,712
so she's too tired for Bingo.

71
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:10,347
Maybe don't tell her
about the elevators.

72
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,083
- Hmm?
- (CHUCKLES) Okay.

73
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:15,819
(SING-SONGY): I solve
problems, that's what I do.

74
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,554
(HUMMING HAPPILY)

75
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:19,222
(HIGH-PITCHED YELP)

76
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:22,092
You still scream like
a little girl, son.

77
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:23,760
What are you doing here?

78
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:25,362
I don't want to sit
alone in an empty house,

79
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:26,796
so I'm with you now.

80
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:27,998
Wha... Mom's going to be volunteering

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,266
at the hospital every day.

82
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:30,901
Then I'll be with you every day.

83
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,702
But I have to go to work.

84
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:34,918
Great, we'll go to work.

85
00:03:35,313 --> 00:03:36,640
We just need to stop off

86
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:38,854
and get me my morning Dr. Pepper.

87
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,577
There's a can in the fridge.

88
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,279
Oh, no, no. It's gotta be draft,

89
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,947
with chewable ice, in a foam cup,

90
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,815
the way the good Lord intended.

91
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,684
- Ah.
- I know where we can get it.

92
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,219
There's a place out by the airport.

93
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:50,754
Oh, great. Yeah.

94
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:53,496
I was just thinking how much
I want to drive to the airport.

95
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,561
All right.

96
00:03:58,563 --> 00:04:00,530
After we get your airport soda,

97
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,432
we need to run by the lumberyard.

98
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:03,900
What about breakfast?

99
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:09,394
Why didn't you make yourself
something in the house?

100
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,141
I don't cook my own food.

101
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:12,475
Somebody does it for me.

102
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:14,110
I'm grandfathered into that.

103
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,112
What does that mean?

104
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:19,182
It means I risked my
life fighting commies,

105
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:21,487
so somebody else makes my chow.

106
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,720

00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:31,227
- You hear that?
- Hmm?

109
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,896
- (CHIMING CONTINUES)
- You hear?

110
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:33,863
Huh?

111
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:35,761
- You know what that sound is?
- Huh?

112
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:37,919
That means put your seat belt on.

113
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:41,755
I don't have to do that, I'm
grandfathered into that, too.

114
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,308
I'll just fly safely
through the windshield.

115
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,647
How 'bout this soda, Donny? Oh...

116
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:00,484
Great job, Pop.

117
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,941
It's delicious...

118
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:03,977
and it looks like it
made Adam really mad.

119
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,245
I can't hear you.

120
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:08,615
All I can hear is "bong bong bong."

121
00:05:08,617 --> 00:05:10,750
Oh, Adam, the insulation guys called.

122
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:11,985
They can meet you at 9:00 tomorrow.

123
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:13,062
Okay, great.

124
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,521
Oh, no, no, no. That's
not going to work.

125
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,656
We need to buy my
lottery tickets at 9:00.

126
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:18,124
That's my lucky time.

127
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:20,793
How is it lucky if you've never won?

128
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:24,164
Every time I don't win,
I'm building up my luck.

129
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,698
That's how it works.

130
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:28,234
- Hey, Dad.
- What?

131
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:29,869
Want to chase the crew
around with the forklift?

132
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,504
Is a duck's ass watertight?

133
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:35,008
ADAM: Listen, Don.

134
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,419
You have got to take Dad off my hands.

135
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:38,845
No way, he wanders off.

136
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:40,213
I lost him in Target once.

137
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,981
I had to use that red
phone and everything.

138
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,418
I love father and son time.

139
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,255
Once a year, my father and
I go hunting for Bigfoot.

140
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,517
I take what I can get.

141
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,760
Just tell Dad you have stuff to do

142
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:55,195
and he needs to entertain himself.

143
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:57,497
I can't do that to the old guy.

144
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:58,932
I'll just suck it up.

145
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:00,400
How bad can it be?

What are you doing?

00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,158
You can't honk another man's horn.

Yes, I can, I'm grandfathered in.

- Hey.

There's four guys in that truck.

155

And now they're getting out. Great.

156
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:23,376
That's why you don't
put your seat belt on.

157
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,251
- It's go time!
- Hey!

158
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,153
You are 75 years old.

159
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,751
Go time is over.

Here's your "middle
of the day" Dr. Pepper.

Sorry it took so long,

162
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,998
they were doing roadwork
down by the airport.

163
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:43,214
Nice try.

164
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:45,706
This is from the Shell
station down the street.

165
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,292
How are you so good at this?

166
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,021
What's this?

167
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,880
Cream for my dry skin.

168
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,515
Why are you giving it to me?

169
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,316
You have to rub it on me.

170
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,083
What?

171
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:03,001
Not everywhere, just
the places I can't reach.

00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,432
My dad has a cream, Andi.

Oh, boy.

00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,881
your mom is having a
blast at the hospital.

181
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,376
Well, I can't do another day.

182
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:34,352
Okay, I-I think you're overreacting.

183
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,620
Oh, really? Am I?

184
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,789
Am I? Am I overreacting?

185
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,188
I am more and more
confident the answer is yes.

186
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,631
Let me show you something.

187
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:49,751
Ooh.

188
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,069
What's in that cream?

189
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,771
Your hands are so soft.

190
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,074
Bong bong bong bong.

191
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,709
I'm hearing it in my sleep now.

192
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,045
Oho, and this is the best part.

193
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,216
Look, Andi, it's my dad.

194
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,542
In our bed.

195
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:09,721
Where's Bev?

196
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,623
She volunteered to
stay for the late shift.

197
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,159
Okay. What's for dinner?

198
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:17,584
Pizza.

199
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:19,460
I... I was thinking meatloaf.

200
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,250
ANDI: Okay, well,

201
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,368
um, meatloaf takes a while, Joe.

202
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,789
Well, I got a good
run of game shows here,

203
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:27,647
I don't mind waiting.

204
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,410
Adam... get him out of there.

205
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:39,199
You need to wrangle your filly, boy.

206
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,770
I don't think she's the problem.

207
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:45,250
It's not my fault.

208
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,210
- Your mother changed the plan.
- What plan?

209
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,792
For our golden years.

210
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:50,752
We were happy

211
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,666
just staying at home,

212
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,168
watching the world go by.

213
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:56,005
Then she started acting different.

214
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:59,062
Did you make her rub that cream on you?

215
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,440
'Cause it's making me act different.

216
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,810
I knew something was coming.

217
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,912
Every morning, we'd go out for our walk

218
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,315
and we'd get to the
sidewalk and we'd turn left.

219
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,840
Then one day

220
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:14,053
last month, she turned right.

221
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:16,379
Why? What was she looking for?

222
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:19,379
And then the Bingo,
and then the hospital.

223
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:21,793
And here I am.

224
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,728
Well, did you talk to
Mom about any of this?

225
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,664
I don't have to talk about my feelings.

226
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,810
I'm grandfathered into that.

227
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:32,496
Where you going?

228
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:33,905
I have to make a meatloaf.

229
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,107
Well, before you go,

230
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,575
would you get me another pillow?

231
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,978
I-I need one for between my legs.

232
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,748
Use Andi's.

233
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,652
I can't believe we're
actually making this meatloaf.

234
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,946
Well, we have to, he's grandfathered in.

235
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,093
You should have heard
him up there, Andi.

236
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,961
He's... lost.

237
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,163
Well, I don't get it.

238
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,251
Bev's gone away before.

239
00:10:00,276 --> 00:10:01,475
She went on that cruise.

240
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,001
Yeah, but he knew everything

241
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,130
would go back to normal in a day or two.

242
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:07,686
This is different. It's
a big change for him.

243
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,343
So, what, Bev has to sit on the
couch for the rest of her life

244
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:12,610
just to make her husband happy?

245
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:14,377
Yes.

246
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,209
Wha...

247
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,834
It's in the vows.

248
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:24,604
We whisper it so you don't hear it.

249
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,001
You have to tell my mom
to quit the hospital.

250
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:29,751
Wha...? I'm not gonna do that.

251
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:30,995
She's happy.

252
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,764
So I have to talk to her all by myself?

253
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,132
Yes.

254
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:35,203
(SCOFFS)

255
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:38,403
Wives don't help their
husbands with bad ideas.

256
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:39,959
It's in the vows.

257
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:43,074
Well...

258
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:44,957
I think it's a good idea.

259
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:48,913
I'll just explain that my
dad is lonely with her gone

260
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,574
and she needs to come back.

261
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:53,151
I wouldn't get involved if I were you.

262
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,753
I'm already involved.

263
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,988
My pillow smells like Brylcreem.

264
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:00,892
It's like sleeping in
Ronald Reagan's arms.

265
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,762
Well, fine, you can use my pillow.

266
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,130
Uh, no, thank you.

267
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,250
I think we're gonna have to take

268
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,001
your pillow out back and shoot it.

269
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,251
Okay, here comes Mom.

270
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:20,302
I'm going to talk to her
about quitting the hospital.

271
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:22,461
Well, then I'm getting out of here.

272
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:24,738
Oh, your dad's up there.

273
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:25,990
Oh, here comes your mom.

274
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:27,349
I... I c...

275
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:28,941
Pantry!

276
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,584
Oh. Hey, sweetie.

277
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,502
Hey, how was your day at the hospital?

278
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,629
Tiring, I'll bet, huh?

279
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,253
Makes you want to say, "Whew,

280
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:39,506
I am never going back there again."

281
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:41,885
Well, lesson learned.

282
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:42,836
You gave it a shot. Yeah?

283
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:45,305
Actually, you know, I feel great.

284
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:47,043
Helping people gives me more energy.

285
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:47,917
More energy?

286
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:50,100
Ooh... I hear that's what happens

287
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:52,836
right before you should quit a job.

288
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:54,919
What are we talking about?

289
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,418
- Hey, speaking of Dad...
- Were we speaking of Dad?

290
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,377
We could talk about Dad
if you want to, yeah, sure.

291
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:00,912
You know, I...

292
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:03,179
I think you threw him a curve ball

293
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,814
by being out of the house so much.

294
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:06,182
He misses you.

295
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,912
Oh, that's what this is about.

296
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,336
You know, honey,

297
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,656
I've been adapting to him my whole life.

298
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,918
Now I'd like it if he could adapt to me.

299
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,061
Well, I'd like it if he could
apply his own damn cream,

300
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:19,788
but that's not happening.

301
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:22,154
(EXHALES)

302
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:24,166
I think what he really misses

303
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,584
is me cooking and cleaning for him.

304
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:30,960
O... Okay, that's a
slightly negative spin on it.

305
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:32,842
I'm just saying I think he'd be happier

306
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:34,644
if you weren't gone so much, you know?

307
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:39,115
And if you think about it,
it's kind of romantic. Huh?

308
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:41,418
Yeah. So he'd be happier

309
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,054
if I weren't doing the
thing that makes me happy.

310
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:47,457
Again, slightly negative spin.

311
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,376
Mmm!

312
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,627
I smell meatloaf.

313
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:52,929
Of course you do, you selfish bastard.

314
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,001
- (DOOR SHUTS)
- What did you do, boy?

315
00:12:58,036 --> 00:13:00,070
I just told her that you missed her.

316
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:02,490
What, are you writing
some kind of romance novel?

317
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,575
I guess I'll be spending the night.

318
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,843
Wh... Where you going?

319
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:08,011
Where do you think?

320
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:10,614
Well, hey, you know,
uh, we have a guest room.

321
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:12,115
I made you.

322
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:13,783
You're my guest.

323
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:21,124
That went well.

324
00:13:23,862 --> 00:13:25,395
Where's the meatloaf?

325
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:28,707
He took it upstairs, like
a groom takes his bride.

326
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,667
ANDI: <i>Hey...</i>

327
00:13:33,672 --> 00:13:35,505
you elbowed me in the nose.

328
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:37,674
I didn't move, you
nosed me in the elbow.

329
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:39,109
Ugh.

330
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:44,201
You are breathing directly into me.

331
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,459
- (EXHALES LOUDLY)
- My air is your exhaust.

332
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:49,911
All right.

333
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,026
I want my bed back.

334
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:57,460
Look, don't worry.

335
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,663
Dad won't be here long.

336
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,959
- Mom will come around.
- Wh...

337
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:03,233
Why are you taking his
side in this whole deal?

338
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:05,435
He's been driving you crazy all week.

339
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:08,004
Well, the man has worked
hard his whole life.

340
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:10,006
He deserves to retire on the couch

341
00:14:10,008 --> 00:14:11,474
with his wife sitting next to him

342
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,909
and cooking him food.

343
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:15,345
Like any man would want.

344
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:19,836
- Like any man?
- Mm.

345
00:14:20,255 --> 00:14:22,188
Not you though, right?

346
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,691
What was the question?

347
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:34,500
I just want to know how you're
picturing our golden years.

348
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,615
Well, I've worked hard
my whole life, too.

349
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,237
So your plan is to just sit and eat?

350
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,218
(CHUCKLES)

351
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:43,673
You think you're making it sound bad,

352
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,742
but you're kind of selling it.

353
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:49,145
Okay, well, that's not healthy.

354
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:51,081
I mean, you might get fat.

355
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,384
Hey, till death, baby.

356
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,254
But I wanted to do
something fun, together.

357
00:14:58,256 --> 00:15:03,560
You know, like open
Pittsburgh's first winery.

358
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:07,157
You just like wine.

359
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:09,614
Yeah, well, I'm going to need it

360
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:12,469
if I'm stuck on the couch
with a supersized shut-in.

361
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:20,610
(CHUCKLING)

362
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:24,101
I am going to breathe
on you so hard tonight.

363
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:31,218
(BREATHING LOUDLY)

364
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:38,495
(GROANS)

365
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:41,297
(GRUNTS)

366
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:44,267
(EXHALES)

367
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:48,138
Adam, we need to talk.

368
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,774
You put the chicken too far away.

369
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:54,277
I'm leaving you.

370
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,690
For who?

371
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,583
For me.

372
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:05,334
Are you leaving me for my own brother?

373
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,209
Yeah, well, I had no choice.

374
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,625
- He kept it tight.
- Mmm.

375
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,168
You know it, mama.

376
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:13,238
(STAMMERS)

377
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,058
Come back, don't go.

378
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,934
Andi. Andi!

379
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,270
Andi...

380
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:24,007
Chicken.

381
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,362
Chicken!

382
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,182
What's for breakfast?

383
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,209
Cereal.

384
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:39,823
I left a note on the fridge
saying I wanted frittatas.

385
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:43,459
Well, those days are behind you.

386
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,962
We need to talk about what's
been going on around here.

387
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,103
I told you what's going on.

388
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:50,767
I went left, your mom went right.

389
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:53,203
Get ready to for two Christmases.

390
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,138
Look...

391
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,574
Okay, listen, you are
going to have to accept

392
00:16:57,576 --> 00:17:01,018
what's happening with
Mom and, you know, adapt.

393
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:02,445
But I'm grandfathered in.

394
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:03,880
That's not a thing!

395
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:06,416
Look...

396
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:09,197
retirement is a team sport.

397
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:11,487
You had everything the way you wanted.

398
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,056
Now Mom has found something
that makes her happy.

399
00:17:13,058 --> 00:17:14,424
Isn't that good?

400
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,687
You think I don't
want to make her happy?

401
00:17:16,712 --> 00:17:18,661
I love her, I... I...

402
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,830
I just, I don't know how
to do any of that stuff.

403
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,165
What stuff?

404
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,600
Home stuff.

405
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:26,148
My mother fed me,

406
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:27,704
then the army fed me

407
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:29,339
and then Bev fed me.

408
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,710
If anything, this is their fault.

409
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:38,506
Okay. You want a frittata?

410
00:17:38,884 --> 00:17:40,116
Let's teach you

411
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:42,129
how to make a frittata.

412
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,487
Then you can make one for Mom.

413
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,389
You think that would make her happy?

414
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:48,080
I do.

415
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:50,039
Okay, let's do it.

416
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,840
All right.

417
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:55,122
You want an apron?

418
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:56,470
I'm willing to try this,

419
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:58,862
but I'm not putting on
a damn cooking costume.

420
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,001
I still don't understand
why you brought me back here.

421
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:13,316
Adam called me and he said that
there is a surprise for you.

422
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:18,765
Joe?

423
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,123
What's this?

424
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,983
I made dinner.

425
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:27,730
What with you being at the
hospital, I want to, um...

426
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:29,947
What did you tell me I wanted to do?

427
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,876
Adapt.

428
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,572
Yeah, that.

429
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,319
You cooked for me?

430
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:40,126
- Well...
- You've never done that before.

431
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:43,146
Retirement is a team sport.

432
00:18:44,515 --> 00:18:46,335
I taught him that.

433
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:50,320
And I taught you that.

434
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:54,076
I just want you to know that

435
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:55,558
I support you.

436
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,043
This is really something, Joe.

437
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,918
- Here. See?
- Oh!

438
00:18:59,943 --> 00:19:02,125
Ooh, you made scrambled eggs.

439
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:03,542
Yeah.

440
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:08,126
Frittatas are a real son of a bitch.

441
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,626
By the way, we need to
figure out something else

442
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:18,323
for our retirement
besides my couch thing.

443
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:22,436
That doesn't end well.

444
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:25,293
Oh, well... (CLEARS THROAT)

445
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:26,555
I have some ideas.

446
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:28,157
Hey, if it makes you happy,

447
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,907
- it makes me happy.
- Aw.

448
00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:32,294
Well, you know I've always loved dogs,

449
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,863
so how about running a dog rescue?

450
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:36,532
I already have a name:

451
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:38,701
It's The Leash You Can Do.

452
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:42,338
Ooh, that's good.

453
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,173
Make him do that.

454
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:46,408
No. No dogs.

455
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,184
Nothing that poops.

456
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:51,543
Once the three poopers we
got go to college, we're done.

457
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:53,876
- All right.
- (CHUCKLES)

458
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:55,956
What else you got?

459
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:56,989
Okay.

460
00:19:57,918 --> 00:20:00,085
How about...

461
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,834
we open a mask store?

462
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:09,965
A what?

463
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,376
A store that sells nothing

464
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,458
but masks from around the world.

465
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:15,545
Ooh, that's a winner.

466
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,140
Yeah. Yeah.

467
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:20,209
And we will call it...

468
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:22,010
Maskwell House.

469
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:28,917
It feels like you're just
coming up with a funny name

470
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,186
and then working backwards from there.

471
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:35,085
Yeah! That's my process.

472
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:36,125
Hmm.

473
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,585
It's cute, right?

474
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:42,331
Hey, guys.

475
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:44,626
You get the hell away from my wife.

476
