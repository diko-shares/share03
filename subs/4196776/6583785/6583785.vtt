Captain Webb.
Good morning

4
00:01:09.587 --> 00:01:12.667
Has everything been explained to you?

5
00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.639
Yes, sir.

6
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:20.259
When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.

7
00:01:20.283 --> 00:01:22.803
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.

8
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:26.821
You knew exaclty what
it meant for you

9
00:01:26.822 --> 00:01:29.535
if you chose to stay.

10
00:01:30.628 --> 00:01:33.876
You can't outrun what you did, Jason.

11
00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:37.627
You made yourself and
know who you are.

12
00:01:37.628 --> 00:01:41.119
Eventually you're gonna
have to face the fact.

13
00:01:41.992 --> 00:01:44.464
You volunteered.

14
00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:54.759
Oh no.

Heather Lee, Cyber Ops, sir.

96
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:39.931
Have you got a name for us?

97
00:10:39.932 --> 00:10:43.091
Our hacker was a
former Agency operative.

98
00:10:43.092 --> 00:10:45.671
Believed to be working with
Christian Dassault, and...

99
00:10:45.672 --> 00:10:49.615
previously linked to
Jason Bourne.

100
00:10:49.624 --> 00:10:51.401

102
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.928
What did they get?

103
00:10:53.929 --> 00:10:58.552
Black ops files, from TreadStone,
all the way to Iron Hand.

104
00:10:58.662 --> 00:11:00.716

108

00:11:15.863 --> 00:11:18.187
How are you going to handle it?

111
00:11:19.922 --> 00:11:22.739
We cut the head off this thing.

112
00:11:26.932 --> 00:11:29.992
Sir, I'd like to be point
on this operation.

113
00:11:33.624 --> 00:11:35.683
You're not indoctrinated
for this material.

114
00:11:35.684 --> 00:11:37.301
I'm already into it.

115
00:11:37.302 --> 00:11:39.832
I embedded malware into
Parsons' download.

116
00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:43.303
When those files are opened,
I can trace them.

117
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:45.413
Let me in.

118
00:11:46.662 --> 00:11:49.016
I'll deliver Parsons, the files,

119
00:11:49.017 --> 00:11:52.453
And if he's out there,
I'll give you Bourne, too.

120
00:12:00.058 --> 00:12:01.489
Excuse me.

00:12:07.239 --> 00:12:09.723

Alright, I think you can help me.

126
00:12:19.462 --> 00:12:22.691
I'm going to give you full
operational control on this.

127
00:12:22.692 --> 00:12:26.895
And I'll assure that you have access
to any relevant teams and resources.

128
00:12:26.896 --> 00:12:31.141

135
00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.892

137
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.481

Parsons boarded a bus half-hour ago

144
00:16:34.657 --> 00:16:37.485
headed west across Athens.
I got two local teams en route.

145
00:16:37.486 --> 00:16:39.801
- Any sign of Bourne?
- Not so far.

146
00:16:39.802 --> 00:16:42.665
He's involved in this somehow,
I can feel it.

147
00:16:44.696 --> 00:16:47.211
Upload all Athens data on feeds.

148
00:16:47.212 --> 00:16:49.224

149
00:16:49.225 --> 00:16:50.714

00:16:52.282 --> 00:16:53.992
Where are we?

151
00:16:54.376 --> 00:16:57.521
Parson's bus has just
arrived at Syntayma Square.

152
00:16:57.522 --> 00:17:00.405
There's a demonstration in front
of the Greek parliament building.

153
00:17:00.406 --> 00:17:02.031
I think she'll use it as cover.

154
00:17:02.032 --> 00:17:04.811

155
00:17:04.812 --> 00:17:07.503

156
00:17:07.504 --> 00:17:09.773
and any possible rendezvous points.

157
00:17:09.774 --> 00:17:11.135
Copy that, sir.

158
00:17:11.136 --> 00:17:13.305
Sir, the asset has landed.

159
00:17:45.445 --> 00:17:47.201

160
00:17:47.202 --> 00:17:48.846
Copy that.

161
00:18:18.637 --> 00:18:20.560
I have the Alpha Team feed.

162
00:18:20.561 --> 00:18:22.021

165
00:18:49.803 --> 00:18:52.131
Isolate all social media
posts from the Square.

166
00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:53.704
Yes, ma'am.

167
00:19:21.502 --> 00:19:23.283

170
00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:44.458
I hacked into the Agency.

171
00:19:44.459 --> 00:19:46.381
For Christian Dassault.

172
00:19:46.382 --> 00:19:49.924
I got all the black ops files,
we're putting them online.

173
00:19:50.057 --> 00:19:52.132
We need to move.

174
00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:56.710
Stop.

175
00:19:57.312 --> 00:20:00.317

177
00:20:09.412 --> 00:20:10.964
Find her.

178
00:20:17.862 --> 00:20:20.797
I told you, Christian Dassault
is going to get you killed.

179
00:20:20.798 --> 00:20:22.540
We don't have a choice, Jason.

180
00:20:22.541 --> 00:20:25.043
It's started again.
A new program.

181

00:20:26.739 --> 00:20:28.522
What's that got to do with me?

183
00:20:28.523 --> 00:20:30.482
Because it matters.
It matters.

184
00:20:30.483 --> 00:20:32.253
Not too me, it doesn't.

185
00:20:32.254 --> 00:20:34.270
All that matters
is staying alive.

186
00:20:34.271 --> 00:20:36.691
You get off the grid.
Survive.

187
00:20:36.692 --> 00:20:39.080
I don't believe that,
and neither do you.

188
00:20:39.081 --> 00:20:40.706
Look at yourself.

189
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.074
Look at what you're doing.

190
00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.751
You can't live like
this for much longer.

191
00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.884
Jason, I came here
because I found something.

192
00:20:51.068 --> 00:20:53.948
I found your father's name
in the Treadstone files.

193
00:20:53.949 --> 00:20:56.341
He was an analyst.
He wasn't in operations.

194
00:20:56.342 --> 00:20:58.156
He wasn't near
any of that stuff.

195
00:20:58.157 --> 00:21:00.021
I'm telling you what I saw.

196
00:21:00.022 --> 00:21:02.309
It looked like he was
involved directly.

197
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.140
And there's more.
More about you.

198
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:06.447
What do you mean?

199
00:21:06.448 --> 00:21:09.830
Before you joined the program,
they were watching you.

200
00:21:09.831 --> 00:21:11.721
Watching me?

201
00:21:12.358 --> 00:21:15.661
You've tortured yourself
for a long time now, Jason.

202
00:21:15.662 --> 00:21:18.290
You tortured yourself
for what you've done.

203
00:21:18.309 --> 00:21:21.347
But you don't know the truth
about what they did to you.

204
00:21:21.411 --> 00:21:23.901
You need to read those files.

205
00:21:28.808 --> 00:21:31.476
Move.
They tracked you.

206
00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:37.900
Alpha 1 has eyes on two targets.
One female, one male.

207
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:40.436
- Identify the male.
- Copy that, sir.

208
00:21:40.437 --> 00:21:43.101
Alpha 1.
We need an ID on the male target.

209
00:21:43.102 --> 00:21:46.871
You gotta get out of here before the
police cut off this part of the city.

210
00:21:52.307 --> 00:21:54.147
Head north.

211
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.821
Meet me at the Statue of Athena.

212
00:21:56.822 --> 00:21:58.778
I'll take them with me.

213
00:22:05.252 --> 00:22:06.935
That's him.

214
00:22:07.488 --> 00:22:09.001
Now.

215
00:22:14.423 --> 00:22:16.491
Stay with Bourne.

216
00:22:16.492 --> 00:22:18.690
Clear to engage the target.

217
00:22:18.691 --> 00:22:19.764
Copy.

218
00:22:19.765 --> 00:22:22.930
Alpha team, stay with the male.
You are clear to engage.

219
00:22:46.327 --> 00:22:47.890
Come on.

220
00:23:24.229 --> 00:23:26.464
Sir, Alpha Team comms are down.

221
00:23:26.465 --> 00:23:28.761
We've lost him, sir.
He's taken them out.

222
00:23:29.591 --> 00:23:32.618
Find Parsons! He'll
come back to get her.

223
00:23:32.619 --> 00:23:36.692
Sir, the rioting is spreading.
The Greek government is declaring a State of Emergency.

224
00:23:40.187 --> 00:23:43.113
Bravo team, you'll be targeting Parsons.

225
00:24:38.352 --> 00:24:40.002
We got her.

226
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.407
BRAVO 1 CAM

227
00:24:42.408 --> 00:24:44.941
Split the team,
put her in a box.

228
00:26:07.188 --> 00:26:10.440
A suspect matcting Bourne's description
has stole a police motorcycle.

229
00:26:10.441 --> 00:26:11.911
He's coming for Parsons.

230
00:26:11.912 --> 00:26:14.853
- Where the hell is the asset?
- 2 minutes out, sir.

231
00:26:47.273 --> 00:26:50.715
- Parsons is at the statue of Athena.
- Copy that.

232
00:27:14.322 --> 00:27:15.749
Bravo Team is down.

233
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.781
Sir, the asset is arriving on scene.

234
00:27:17.782 --> 00:27:19.236
- Pull up the dash cam.
- Copy.

235
00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:21.910
Give me the feed in
direct comm to the Asset.

236
00:27:28.886 --> 00:27:30.889
Engaging targets.

237
00:27:46.854 --> 00:27:49.491
I'm accessing Athens police tactical data.

238
00:27:49.492 --> 00:27:50.957
I need eyes overhead.

239
00:27:50.958 --> 00:27:52.561
Bring up the satellite's sweep.

240
00:27:52.562 --> 00:27:55.491
Sir, I'm showing a Misty and
a KH-12 satellite available.

241
00:27:55.492 --> 00:27:58.007
- Connect to 12.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:28:10.349 --> 00:28:12.713
Satellite video feed is online.

243
00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:15.263
Barricades Detected

244
00:28:15.264 --> 00:28:17.254
Police have blocked
the road to the north.

245
00:28:17.255 --> 00:28:19.952
The target will be
forced to turn left.

246
00:28:32.995 --> 00:28:37.054
Another barricade in 200 meters.
Target turning left again.

247
00:28:48.849 --> 00:28:50.553
Bourne's heading for the alley.

248
00:28:50.554 --> 00:28:52.741
Left at top of the hill.

249
00:29:25.336 --> 00:29:27.885
Stairway, up the hill
Heading east.

250
00:29:27.886 --> 00:29:29.312
Give me a strike point.

251
00:29:29.313 --> 00:29:30.840
He's found a way out.

252
00:29:30.841 --> 00:29:34.221
200 meters to your left.
19 Solomou.

253
00:29:34.222 --> 00:29:35.593
Get to the roof.

254
00:29:35.594 --> 00:29:37.581
Target should pass
within your line-of-sight.

255
00:29:37.582 --> 00:29:39.829
19 Solomou, copy.

256
00:29:47.594 --> 00:29:49.850
Focus the satellite on these coordinates.

257
00:29:49.851 --> 00:29:52.042
And give me a lock on the
motorcycle when it gets there.

258
00:29:52.043 --> 00:29:53.382
Copy that.

259
00:30:19.656 --> 00:30:23.081
I've got the targets.
They're approaching Emmanouil and Fidiou.

260
00:30:23.082 --> 00:30:26.259
- Look west.
- The long boulevard.

261
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.639
Coming at you in 55 seconds.

262
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.311
Copy that.

263
00:30:54.124 --> 00:30:56.209
- The asset is online.

264
00:31:08.632 --> 00:31:11.932
Targets with you in 15 seconds.

265
00:31:19.084 --> 00:31:21.136
5 seconds.

266
00:31:27.293 --> 00:31:28.380
Contact.

267
00:31:28.381 --> 00:31:30.089
Stay low!

268
00:31:34.186 --> 00:31:36.249
Find a shot.

269
00:31:38.967 --> 00:31:40.741
Hold on!

270
00:32:17.832 --> 00:32:19.041
Where's Bourne?

271
00:32:19.042 --> 00:32:21.677
Ma'am, a police helicopter has spotted
3 bodies on the roof near the asset.

272
00:32:21.678 --> 00:32:23.893
A tactical team is on it's way.

273
00:32:32.573 --> 00:32:34.200
Nicky!

274
00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.013
Don't move!

275
00:32:58.109 --> 00:33:00.333
Athens police has entered the building.

276
00:33:00.334 --> 00:33:03.137
Asset, you need to
get out of there.

277
00:33:03.138 --> 00:33:04.874
Negative.

278
00:33:06.462 --> 00:33:08.953
We don't even know
if Bourne's alive.

279
00:33:10.068 --> 00:33:12.241
You want to lose this guy?

280
00:33:17.052 --> 00:33:20.416
This is Director Dewey,
you have 20 seconds.

281
00:33:25.192 --> 00:33:27.139
Hold on, Nicky.

282
00:33:27.903 --> 00:33:29.976
I'm going to get you to cover.

283
00:33:31.007 --> 00:33:32.630
No.

284
00:33:37.632 --> 00:33:39.016
No.

285
00:33:40.699 --> 00:33:43.099
No.
Don't.

286
00:33:46.111 --> 00:33:47.756
I'm coming.

287
00:34:45.238 --> 00:34:47.561
- Get a location on Christian Dassault.
- Yes, sir.

288
00:34:47.562 --> 00:34:51.621
If he was working with Nikky Parsons,
he will lead us to Jason Bourne.

289
00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:54.151
And let me know if you
get a hit on that malware.

290
00:34:54.152 --> 00:34:56.946
Sir, can I clarify one thing.

291
00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.908
Yeah.

292
00:34:58.909 --> 00:35:01.161
Does the asset know Bourne?

293
00:35:01.162 --> 00:35:03.481
Why would you ask me that?

294
00:35:03.482 --> 00:35:06.197
His behavior on the roof-top.

295
00:35:06.198 --> 00:35:08.563
It suggested a connection.

296
00:35:09.569 --> 00:35:13.861
The last time Bourne came back,
he exposed the Black Briar program.

297
00:35:13.862 --> 00:35:16.915
It compromised active operations.

298
00:35:16.916 --> 00:35:20.123
The asset was in Syria, undercover.

299
00:35:20.868 --> 00:35:22.240
He was captured, tortured.

300
00:35:22.241 --> 00:35:25.979
And it took 2 damn
years to get him out.

301
00:35:27.191 --> 00:35:31.261
So you think that's why Bourne
wants the files to go public again?

302
00:35:31.262 --> 00:35:32.933
I have no idea
why he came back.

303
00:35:32.934 --> 00:35:35.053
But whatever he's doing,
he wants to destroy us.

304
00:35:35.054 --> 00:35:37.369
We can't let that happen.

305
00:35:37.587 --> 00:35:41.873
So you give me a call,
as soon as you hear anything.

306
00:35:42.674 --> 00:35:44.424
Yes, sir.

307
00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:07.401
ENCRYPTED

308
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.940
TREADSTONE -> IRONHAND

Kollwitzplatz 49, 28764 Berlin

316
00:38:36.706 --> 00:38:42.442
And now the founder and chairman
of Deep Dream, Aaron Kalloor.

317
00:38:43.858 --> 00:38:45.427
Hi.

318
00:38:51.022 --> 00:38:54.181
You all know why you're here.
We're going to be unveiling a new platform.

319
00:38:54.182 --> 00:38:58.341
We think it is a bold new step, to
allow us to serve our community better.

320
00:38:58.342 --> 00:39:02.211
We're a community right now that's
trascending national boundaries, and

321
00:39:02.212 --> 00:39:05.469
I think we're at 1.5 billion users.

322
00:39:12.578 --> 00:39:15.882
In a nutshell. As you know we
have an ecosystem of

323
00:39:15.883 --> 00:39:18.829
hundreds of thousands
of apps at this point.

324
00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:22.271
And what this new platform
will do will be to integrate

325
00:39:22.272 --> 00:39:24.525
user's data and preferences,

326
00:39:24.526 --> 00:39:28.441
and use that information,
to enrich and tailor-make

327
00:39:28.442 --> 00:39:33.107
each unique user experience, in a
way that is frankly, unprecedented.

328
00:39:33.108 --> 00:39:37.729
Now, I can see some journalists' pens
twitching and ready to ask about privacy.

329
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:38.604
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

330
00:39:38.605 --> 00:39:40.775
Uh. This is a concern of many
people, and so it should be.

331
00:39:40.776 --> 00:39:44.158
This is something that matters
to us, and let me just say

332
00:39:44.252 --> 00:39:47.495
I understand nobody wants to feel
like they're being watched

333
00:39:47.496 --> 00:39:51.481
So let just tell you, when you come to
Deep Dream, when you use our service.

334
00:39:51.482 --> 00:39:53.812
No one will be watching you.

335
00:40:10.032 --> 00:40:12.554
- Mr. Kalloor.
- Right this way, sir.

336
00:40:22.692 --> 00:40:24.031
Enjoy your meal?

337
00:40:24.032 --> 00:40:25.625
Thank you.

338
00:40:27.421 --> 00:40:28.641
Congratulations.

339
00:40:28.642 --> 00:40:31.625
I hear you stock-holders were very
happy with the new platform.

340
00:40:31.626 --> 00:40:33.966
And I heard you got hacked.

341
00:40:35.052 --> 00:40:36.818
We're dealing with it.

342
00:40:36.819 --> 00:40:40.534
This changes everything.
There's too much risk.

343
00:40:40.845 --> 00:40:42.022
I'm out.

344
00:40:42.023 --> 00:40:43.490
Aaron.

345
00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:47.991
You are an extraordinary gifted
and perceptive young man.

346
00:40:47.992 --> 00:40:53.962
When you agreed to help us it was because
you understood the very grave threats...

347
00:41:01.049 --> 00:41:03.378
Do you have any idea the shit-storm
I'll have on my hands

348
00:41:03.379 --> 00:41:06.061
if this arrangement becomes public?

349
00:41:06.412 --> 00:41:09.290
I've already took a hit with Snowden,
and you want more?

350
00:41:09.291 --> 00:41:12.261
Our enemies have become
much more sophisticated.

351
00:41:12.262 --> 00:41:14.535
Gathering meta-data is
no longer adequate.

352
00:41:14.536 --> 00:41:17.287
We need a backdoor into
your new platform,

353
00:41:17.288 --> 00:41:18.630
and a way past the encryptions.

354
00:41:18.631 --> 00:41:22.077
And when that's not enough,
you'll want something new.

You don't get it, do you?

356
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:28.061
Privacy is... is freedom.

357
00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:30.271
Oh I mean, that's something you
should think about defending.

358
00:41:30.272 --> 00:41:32.644
You little prick, you didn't
believe in privacy or freedom

359
00:41:32.645 --> 00:41:35.181
when we funded your start up
that turned you into a billionaire.

360
00:41:35.182 --> 00:41:38.226
I have paid you back many,
many, many times over.

361
00:41:38.227 --> 00:41:40.904
And I was never comfortable
with any of this.

362
00:41:40.932 --> 00:41:42.509
I'm out.

363
00:41:43.758 --> 00:41:45.398
I'm done selling
out our customers.

364
00:41:45.399 --> 00:41:48.155
Yet you would sell
out your country.

365
00:41:48.295 --> 00:41:49.841
The truth is,

366
00:41:49.842 --> 00:41:52.541
we wouldn't be having this
conversation if you didn't feel

367
00:41:52.542 --> 00:41:54.557
personally at risk.

368
00:41:54.558 --> 00:41:57.961
You talk about a free internet, you tell
yourself you're saving the world,

369
00:41:57.962 --> 00:42:00.938
But all you're doing is making it
a much more dangerous place.

370
00:42:00.939 --> 00:42:05.631
And you sure as hell making this country
much more difficult to defend.

371
00:42:05.632 --> 00:42:09.784
And you're sure as hell
accountable for that, Aaron.

372
00:42:11.652 --> 00:42:13.394

It's an address linked

Jason, your Dad was a patriot.

He could see the threats that
America was facing, and like you

456
00:53:08.736 --> 00:53:13.969
he chose to serve his country

457
00:53:14.337 --> 00:53:17.148
He would not want to see

Malcom Smith, contract-only,
based out of London

469
00:55:20.922 --> 00:55:24.431
Ran all of Tradestone's surveillance in
the late 90s, when Bourne was recruited.

470
00:55:24.432 --> 00:55:25.846
Is he still active?

471
00:55:25.847 --> 00:55:27.281
He's private security now.

472
00:55:27.282 --> 00:55:30.881
Contact the asset and tell him I want
him on the ground in London in 6 hours.

473
00:55:30.882 --> 00:55:33.432
I think that could be a mistake, sir.

474
00:55:36.383 --> 00:55:37.741
A mistake, why?

475
00:55:37.742 --> 00:55:41.659
There's an argument for catching Bourne,
instead of killing him.

476
00:55:42.512 --> 00:55:44.341
Alright, let's hear it.

477
00:55:44.342 --> 00:55:47.111
Bourne's been off the
grid for a long time.

478
00:55:47.112 --> 00:55:49.971
He's been hiding in the shadows.
He's seen things.

479
00:55:49.972 --> 00:55:52.200
He knows things that could help us.

480
00:55:52.201 --> 00:55:55.011
Bringing him back in,
is the smart move.

481
00:55:55.012 --> 00:55:56.905
And how are we going to do that?

482
00:55:56.906 --> 00:56:00.181
Albert Herchtz wrote a psych evaluation
when Bourne left the program.

483
00:56:00.182 --> 00:56:02.751
He concluded Bourne
is still a patriot at heart.

484
00:56:02.752 --> 00:56:06.319
And that leaving the program
could come back to haunt him.

485
00:56:08.262 --> 00:56:10.128
And what are you suggesting?

486
00:56:10.129 --> 00:56:12.875
I watched Bourne with those files.

487
00:56:13.752 --> 00:56:16.491
Desperately looking into his past and...

488
00:56:16.492 --> 00:56:18.703
I think he's at a tipping point.

489
00:56:18.704 --> 00:56:21.470
If I could get
face to face with him.

490
00:56:21.542 --> 00:56:23.941
I think I can bring him back in.

491
00:56:23.942 --> 00:56:25.327
One attempt.

492
00:56:25.328 --> 00:56:27.436
And if it fails,

493
00:56:27.642 --> 00:56:29.712
you do what you have to.

494
00:56:33.312 --> 00:56:36.805
Well, it makes sense to me.
What do you think, Bob?

495
00:56:38.102 --> 00:56:40.416
Let's give it a shot.

496
00:56:40.417 --> 00:56:42.181
Alright, do it.

497
00:56:42.182 --> 00:56:43.721
Bring Bourne in.

498
00:56:43.722 --> 00:56:45.126
Or tie it off.

499
00:56:45.127 --> 00:56:47.954
- This ends now.
- Thank you, sir.

500
00:56:59.302 --> 00:57:00.600
Sir, I'm sorry.

501
00:57:00.601 --> 00:57:02.952
Oh, no.
Don't worry about that.

502
00:57:03.871 --> 00:57:06.621
Better get some sleep, kid.

503
00:57:07.364 --> 00:57:10.554
You got a long 24 hours

504
00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:14.976
Yes, sir.

505
00:57:29.082 --> 00:57:31.790
It's taking too long, it shouldn't still
be buggy this close to launch.

506
00:57:31.791 --> 00:57:34.153
Well, I don't think it's buggy.
I think we've changed some things

507
00:57:34.154 --> 00:57:36.887
that's gonna change the parameters,
we're going to have to go and...

508
00:57:36.888 --> 00:57:38.391
Okay, then we need
to change them back.

509
00:57:38.392 --> 00:57:40.931
- Amanda, can we get that note over to Kyle?
- Absolutely.

510
00:57:40.932 --> 00:57:42.437
Look, I don't... I...
I think you're right.

511
00:57:42.438 --> 00:57:45.280
- I just don't think we want the...
- I'm tired of this.

512
00:57:47.801 --> 00:57:49.373
Mr. Kalloor.

513
00:57:49.374 --> 00:57:50.533
What the hell is this?

514
00:57:50.534 --> 00:57:52.364
Mr. Kalloor, my name is John Barros.

515
00:57:52.365 --> 00:57:54.075
I'm from the Department of Justice.

516
00:57:54.076 --> 00:57:56.634
And I'm hereby serving you
with the enclosed complaint

517
00:57:56.635 --> 00:57:58.641
- issued by the US government.
- Really, you have to do this in public?

518
00:57:58.642 --> 00:58:01.936
against Deep Dream Corporation
for violation of the Sherman Act.

519
00:58:01.937 --> 00:58:06.090
This complaint requires you to preserve all
personal and corporate financial records.

520
00:58:06.091 --> 00:58:09.507
Pending anti-trust motions
to be filed in Federal Court.

521
00:58:09.508 --> 00:58:11.164
Good day.

522
00:58:22.172 --> 00:58:24.276
- This is Dewey.
- Aaron.

523
00:58:24.277 --> 00:58:25.834
It's a message.

524
00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:28.891
And maybe we should think about what
we're doing before it gets any worse.

525
00:58:28.892 --> 00:58:32.436
So, you think if we give him
what he wants, it will end there.

526
00:58:32.437 --> 00:58:35.673
I'm just saying that
maybe we should listen.

527
00:58:36.662 --> 00:58:40.331
I want you to pull up all the records
of all the meetings I've had with Dewey.

528
00:58:40.332 --> 00:58:42.061
All the records?

529
00:58:42.062 --> 00:58:44.706
Even the off the books discussions?

530
00:58:44.707 --> 00:58:46.736
Especially, those...

531
00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:52.251
I'm going to Vegas,
I need an insurance policy.

532
00:59:39.962 --> 00:59:42.878
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
Press Releases

533
00:59:42.982 --> 00:59:46.538
New Cyber Division Head Appointed
Heather Lee joins us from...

534
00:59:54.487 --> 01:00:00.357
"I'm choosing the CIA because I think I can make a real difference there"
- Heather Lee

535
01:00:12.752 --> 01:00:14.231
Yeah.

536
01:00:14.494 --> 01:00:15.971
You in London?

537
01:00:15.972 --> 01:00:17.503
Yes.

538
01:00:18.043 --> 01:00:20.255
Why are you sending her?

539
01:00:20.522 --> 01:00:22.956
She serves a purpose.

540
01:00:23.339 --> 01:00:24.692
I work alone.

541
01:00:24.693 --> 01:00:26.622
Not this time.

542
01:00:26.941 --> 01:00:29.302
Don't make this personal.

543
01:00:29.842 --> 01:00:31.679
Bourne betrayed us.

544
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.578
It's always been personal.

545
01:00:33.579 --> 01:00:36.207
You know who you're dealing with.

546
01:00:36.208 --> 01:00:38.575
You better make sure you're ready.

547
01:00:47.692 --> 01:00:48.764
Yeah?

548
01:00:48.765 --> 01:00:51.539
There's something you should
know about Deep Dream.

549
01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:54.093
But I need an assurance...

550
01:00:54.473 --> 01:00:56.987
that I have your support.

551
01:00:58.482 --> 01:01:01.094
You got it.
What do you have?

552
01:01:01.212 --> 01:01:02.716
Kalloor,

553
01:01:02.717 --> 01:01:06.002
is planning something,
for Vegas.

554
01:01:10.597 --> 01:01:13.728
LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM

555
01:01:51.089 --> 01:01:52.172
Yes?

556
01:01:52.173 --> 01:01:54.141
This is Jason Bourne.

557
01:01:54.142 --> 01:01:56.239
I need to talk.

558
01:01:56.749 --> 01:01:58.016
What about?

559
01:01:58.017 --> 01:01:59.992
I don't work for
the Agency anymore.

560
01:01:59.993 --> 01:02:02.698
Paddington Plaza, 15 minutes.

561
01:02:32.006 --> 01:02:33.933
Bourne just called Smith.

562
01:02:33.934 --> 01:02:37.195
They're meeting at
Paddington Plaza, 15 minutes.

563
01:02:37.196 --> 01:02:39.181
We'll tail Smith the whole way.

564
01:02:39.182 --> 01:02:42.234
As soon as we get eyes on Bourne,
I'll approach him.

565
01:02:42.235 --> 01:02:43.858
Whatever you do stay contain.

566
01:02:43.859 --> 01:02:46.968
I don't want the Brits falling
all over this asking questions.

567
01:02:46.969 --> 01:02:48.614
Understood.

568
01:02:56.532 --> 01:02:58.541
Tracking device.

569
01:02:59.112 --> 01:03:01.923
You'll hold on the south
side of the bridge.

570
01:03:02.217 --> 01:03:04.365
I'll contact you if I need you.

571
01:03:04.366 --> 01:03:05.929
Sure,

572
01:03:06.812 --> 01:03:08.785
You're the boss, right?

573
01:03:36.966 --> 01:03:40.304
Subject is on the move.
Heading towards the Canal.

574
01:03:40.602 --> 01:03:42.821
Alpha Team take a parallel track.

575
01:03:42.822 --> 01:03:45.421
Bravo Team, follow the
subject from behind.

576
01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:47.328
And keep your eyes
open for Bourne.

577
01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:49.879
Bravo Team, tailing subject.

578
01:03:58.162 --> 01:03:59.460
Let's go.

579
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:01.342
In 200 meters, make a right.

580
01:04:01.343 --> 01:04:02.810
Copy that.

581
01:04:08.472 --> 01:04:11.789
Comms check, second channel.
Do you copy?

582
01:04:12.142 --> 01:04:13.710
I have you.
Where are you now?

583
01:04:13.711 --> 01:04:15.628
Heading towards Smith.

584
01:04:16.716 --> 01:04:18.696
No sign of Bourne.

585
01:04:44.436 --> 01:04:46.283
Electrical switchroom

586
01:04:59.931 --> 01:05:02.716
Subject is turning east.
Into an alley.

587
01:05:02.717 --> 01:05:06.771
Alpha Team, that alley leads to a
foot bridge, which will bring him to you.

588
01:05:06.772 --> 01:05:08.456
Copy that.

589
01:05:20.047 --> 01:05:21.611
Bravo Team is down.

590
01:05:21.612 --> 01:05:24.097
Sending you updated route now.

591
01:05:24.962 --> 01:05:26.914
You copy that, Smith?

592
01:05:28.741 --> 01:05:30.272
Yes.

593
01:05:48.066 --> 01:05:51.692
Bravo Team, why aren't you moving?
What's going on?

594
01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:55.291
Bravo Team, do you copy?

595
01:05:55.292 --> 01:05:57.703
What's happening, Heather,
where's Bravo?

596
01:05:58.122 --> 01:05:59.847
We're comms down on Bravo.

597
01:05:59.848 --> 01:06:02.427
Alpha Team do you have
eyes on the subject?

598
01:06:06.995 --> 01:06:08.859
We have eyes on him.

599
01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:17.321
Alpha Team, sitrep.

600
01:06:21.894 --> 01:06:23.673
Alpha Team report.

601
01:06:23.674 --> 01:06:25.606
What's happening Heather?

602
01:06:26.292 --> 01:06:28.229
Alpha Team isn't responding.

603
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:29.594
Bravo?

604
01:06:29.595 --> 01:06:30.841
Still nothing.

605
01:06:30.842 --> 01:06:31.966
You lost both teams?

606
01:06:31.967 --> 01:06:34.801
Get a grip on this operation,
Heather, that's Bourne.

607
01:06:34.802 --> 01:06:36.690
Bring out the asset.

608
01:06:36.997 --> 01:06:38.587
Sir, I need more time.

609
01:06:38.588 --> 01:06:40.205
We have no time.

610
01:06:40.206 --> 01:06:42.447
Are you going to give
that order or not?

611
01:06:42.448 --> 01:06:43.793
Sir, please.

612
01:06:43.794 --> 01:06:48.411
If you're too naive to see the trees,
there's no bringing in Bourne.

613
01:06:48.412 --> 01:06:50.068
He has to be put down.

614
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:52.429
And you obviously cannot
do what has to be done.

615
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:55.378
I am taking operational control.

616
01:06:55.842 --> 01:06:57.987
Asset, you have a green light.

617
01:06:57.988 --> 01:07:00.885
Repeat, you have a
green light on Bourne.

618
01:07:00.886 --> 01:07:01.963
Copy that.

619
01:07:01.964 --> 01:07:03.743
I'm on my way.

620
01:07:11.473 --> 01:07:13.516
Asset, are you on the move?

621
01:07:15.902 --> 01:07:18.896
Asset, your tracking device
says you're stationary.

622
01:07:18.897 --> 01:07:20.499
Are you moving?

623
01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.350
Heather, stay off this channel,
let him do his job.

624
01:07:27.097 --> 01:07:30.009
Left tier.
Get to Paddington Plaza fast.

625
01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:31.539
Copy that.

626
01:08:13.447 --> 01:08:15.127
In position.

627
01:08:24.678 --> 01:08:26.350
Locked in.

628
01:08:44.865 --> 01:08:46.310
What's going on?

629
01:08:46.311 --> 01:08:48.229
What's that noise?

630
01:08:48.652 --> 01:08:50.746
Multiple fire alarms.

631
01:08:50.747 --> 01:08:52.560
That's Bourne.

632
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:57.773
What do I do?.

633
01:08:58.387 --> 01:09:00.966
You stay there and
you do not move.

634
01:09:08.164 --> 01:09:11.690
Please proceed to the
nearest available exit.

635
01:09:12.527 --> 01:09:14.067
I can't stay here.

636
01:09:14.068 --> 01:09:15.310
You can't protect me.

637
01:09:15.311 --> 01:09:17.733
I need you to stay
where you are, Smith.

638
01:09:17.734 --> 01:09:19.783
You still have line of sight?

639
01:09:21.005 --> 01:09:22.581
I'm on him.

640
01:09:22.582 --> 01:09:24.114
You're going to shoot him?

641
01:09:24.115 --> 01:09:26.221
In the crowd when he is
right next to me?

642
01:09:26.222 --> 01:09:27.957
Stay where you are, Smith.

643
01:09:27.958 --> 01:09:29.684
You know why he's here.

644
01:09:29.685 --> 01:09:31.255
He wants answers.

645
01:09:31.256 --> 01:09:33.179
You've lost this thing.

646
01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:35.100
I got to get out of here.

647
01:09:41.915 --> 01:09:43.335
Shit!

648
01:09:52.232 --> 01:09:53.687
What the hell is going on?

649
01:09:53.688 --> 01:09:55.486
Bourne's got Smith.

650
01:10:14.102 --> 01:10:17.050
Go after them.
I'll come around and cut them off.

651
01:10:22.379 --> 01:10:23.732
Smith, I know you're with Bourne.

652
01:10:23.733 --> 01:10:26.406
You have to find a way to
let us know where you are.

653
01:10:28.907 --> 01:10:30.979
Why are you taking me in here?

654
01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:33.078
They got to be near the Plaza.

655
01:10:38.041 --> 01:10:39.853
Jesus, Bourne.

656
01:10:39.854 --> 01:10:41.593
God damn it.

657
01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:44.690
Take it easy.

658
01:10:44.691 --> 01:10:46.002
Richard Webb.

659
01:10:46.003 --> 01:10:47.836
- Station Chief, Beirut.

660
01:10:47.837 --> 01:10:50.641
He was my father,
he started Treadstone.

661
01:10:50.642 --> 01:10:53.513
- He hired you to put me under survellaince, why?
- Jesus.

662
01:10:53.514 --> 01:10:54.841
Why did he hire you?

663
01:10:54.842 --> 01:10:56.427
Don't say anything, Smith.

664
01:10:56.428 --> 01:10:58.877
No.
No.

665
01:11:05.321 --> 01:11:06.606
There's no sign of them.

666
01:11:06.607 --> 01:11:07.955
What do you want us to do?

667
01:11:07.956 --> 01:11:09.952
Work you way down the Canal.

668
01:11:09.953 --> 01:11:12.351
I'll circle around and meet you there.

669
01:11:15.763 --> 01:11:18.005
You followed my to Beirut.

670
01:11:18.006 --> 01:11:20.324
The last time I saw my father!

671
01:11:20.325 --> 01:11:22.305
Why would he have you follow me?

672
01:11:22.306 --> 01:11:24.428
It doesn't make any sense.
Why?

673
01:11:24.429 --> 01:11:27.072
Don't give him a god damn thing.

674
01:11:27.073 --> 01:11:28.766
Why?

675
01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:39.246
Jesus Christ, Bourne, I'm falling.

676
01:11:39.247 --> 01:11:40.854
Bourne, please!

677
01:11:40.855 --> 01:11:42.454
I can hear them.

678
01:11:42.792 --> 01:11:43.956
Beirut!

679
01:11:43.957 --> 01:11:47.461
I went there to tell him
that Treadstone had approached me.

680
01:11:47.462 --> 01:11:50.856
But if it was his program,
why didn't he say anything to me?

681
01:11:51.559 --> 01:11:53.520
I've done something.

682
01:11:53.782 --> 01:11:55.528
Something...

683
01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:59.122
that came at a cost.

684
01:12:02.773 --> 01:12:05.073
That was the day he was killed.

685
01:12:05.253 --> 01:12:07.706
They said he was killed by terrorists.

686
01:12:07.707 --> 01:12:10.246
He wasn't killed by terrorists, was he?

687
01:12:10.247 --> 01:12:13.823
Think about your family's safety, Smith,
and keep your mouth shut.

688
01:12:13.824 --> 01:12:16.072
The next bullet is in your head!

689
01:12:16.355 --> 01:12:18.305
Why was he killed?

690
01:12:18.986 --> 01:12:20.462
Why?

691
01:12:21.392 --> 01:12:23.860
He was killed because of you.

692
01:12:26.612 --> 01:12:29.730
Your father,
he wasn't in operations.

693
01:12:29.731 --> 01:12:32.699
He didn't know we've chosen you.
When he found out, he...

694
01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.087
He threatened to expose the program.

695
01:12:35.088 --> 01:12:38.060
He didn't want you
turned into a killer.

696
01:12:45.584 --> 01:12:47.226
Who killed him?

697
01:12:55.922 --> 01:12:57.101
Who killed him?

698
01:12:57.102 --> 01:12:58.850
Don't do it.

699
01:12:59.401 --> 01:13:01.209
Where is he?

700
01:13:02.363 --> 01:13:04.531
He's almost there.

701
01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:10.317
We're going to stop this now.

702
01:13:11.936 --> 01:13:13.433
Please.

703
01:13:30.136 --> 01:13:32.670
God!
Someone call an ambulance!

704
01:13:33.446 --> 01:13:35.145
- Someone help.
- What's happened?

705
01:13:35.146 --> 01:13:37.723
He went off the roof.
5 floors.

706
01:13:37.724 --> 01:13:39.437
He recognized me.

707
01:13:39.438 --> 01:13:41.606
I'm going to make sure
it's finished.

708
01:13:46.859 --> 01:13:48.446
The cops are coming now.

709
01:13:48.447 --> 01:13:50.720
Mate, don't get up, mate.

710
01:13:54.523 --> 01:13:56.167
Step aside, please.
Step aside.

711
01:13:56.168 --> 01:13:58.219
- Move it!
- Everybody step back.

712
01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.272
- Please back off.
- Step back.

713
01:14:02.224 --> 01:14:03.596
Did anybody see what happened?

714
01:14:03.597 --> 01:14:05.184
- He's gone.
- Oh, shit.

715
01:14:05.185 --> 01:14:06.657
I'm going after him.

716
01:14:06.658 --> 01:14:08.836
I'll work my way
down the canal.

717
01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:12.136
No.
You're done in London.

718
01:14:12.137 --> 01:14:13.610
What are you talking about?

719
01:14:13.611 --> 01:14:15.921
There's another play to be made.

720
01:14:15.922 --> 01:14:18.446
Now that he knows what we did,
he'll come for both of us.

721
01:14:18.447 --> 01:14:21.831
And that could be the
opportunity for something else.

722
01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:23.681
This isn't about revenge.

723
01:14:23.682 --> 01:14:25.041
Yes, it is.

724
01:14:25.042 --> 01:14:27.992
And it won't be done
till one of us is dead.

725
01:14:28.054 --> 01:14:30.044
Get to the airport.

726
01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:32.983
We have a problem with Iron Hand.

727
01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.807
Copy that.

728
01:14:43.868 --> 01:14:45.198
Give me a sitrep.

729
01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:46.877
We've got nothing.

730
01:14:46.878 --> 01:14:48.702
Keep looking.

731
01:14:55.202 --> 01:14:56.673
Drive.

732
01:15:01.927 --> 01:15:04.301
It wasn't supposed to go
like this, I wanted to talk.

733
01:15:04.302 --> 01:15:06.127
Where is Dewey going?

734
01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:14.019
He's going to Vegas to speak with
Aaron Kalloor at the cyber convention.

735
01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:16.906
The Agency recruits there every year.

736
01:15:16.911 --> 01:15:18.892
What's Iron Hand?

737
01:15:20.982 --> 01:15:23.319
Dewey's new black ops program.

738
01:15:23.437 --> 01:15:25.524
Full sprectrum surveillance.

739
01:15:25.525 --> 01:15:28.198
Watching everyone all the time.

740
01:15:28.366 --> 01:15:31.646
Dewey needs Kalloor's
cooperation to bring it online.

741
01:15:34.092 --> 01:15:35.806
Let me out.

742
01:15:37.082 --> 01:15:39.082
I can help you get there.

743
01:15:42.577 --> 01:15:43.924
Why would you do that?

744
01:15:43.925 --> 01:15:47.965
You and I have different reasons,
but we both want Dewey gone.

745
01:15:52.123 --> 01:15:54.411
Here, take this.

746
01:16:07.681 --> 01:16:09.773
I'll see you in Vegas.

747
01:16:24.795 --> 01:16:27.506
LAS VEGAS, NEVADA

748
01:16:34.411 --> 01:16:35.716
Sir.

749
01:16:36.402 --> 01:16:39.334
We're pinning Kalloor's hit on a
fictional Jihadi shooter.

750
01:16:39.335 --> 01:16:41.465
A 20 year old Iraqi national.

751
01:16:41.466 --> 01:16:45.503
We created bank accounts,
travel documents, emails, phone records.

752
01:16:45.504 --> 01:16:48.251
- He'll look like a lone wolf.
- Any physical evidence?

753
01:16:48.252 --> 01:16:51.871
The asset leaves the gun, it'll
have the Iraqi's prints on it.

754
01:16:52.833 --> 01:16:55.680
Russell doesn't need
to know about this.

755
01:16:57.718 --> 01:16:59.738
I understand sir.

756
01:17:00.119 --> 01:17:02.313
Any news on Bourne.

757
01:17:02.382 --> 01:17:03.993
Nothing.

758
01:17:05.267 --> 01:17:07.853
He was always
going to come for me.

759
01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:12.374
Well, if it happens,
we'll deal with it.

- modify clearance

764
01:17:49.272 --> 01:17:52.430
What was the purpose of your
visit to London, Mr. Michaels?

765
01:17:53.017 --> 01:17:54.736
Business.

Thank you,

770
01:18:45.268 --> 01:18:48.033

01:19:51.212 --> 01:19:52.849
Hi, welcome to the Aria.

774
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:55.439

Thank you.

779
01:20:13.804 --> 01:20:15.313
There!
There he is!

780
01:20:15.314 --> 01:20:17.336
Aaron!
- Aaron!

781
01:20:19.503 --> 01:20:22.427
- Alright, Aaron!
- Aaron!

782
01:20:33.683 --> 01:20:35.435
Find Lee.

783
01:20:35.756 --> 01:20:38.031
Tell her I want to see
her before we go onstage.

784
01:20:38.032 --> 01:20:39.561
Yes, sir.

785
01:20:39.562 --> 01:20:41.947
I want agents posted backstage
as well as the auditorium.

786
01:20:41.948 --> 01:20:43.249
Yes, sir.

787
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:44.622
Aaron!

788
01:20:52.902 --> 01:20:54.680
Coming through, make a hole.

789
01:20:54.681 --> 01:20:57.537
Make a hole.
Make a hole.

790
01:20:58.075 --> 01:20:59.614
Stop.

791
01:20:59.615 --> 01:21:00.476
Hi, guys.

792
01:21:00.477 --> 01:21:02.349
Hi, how's it going?
Aaron.

793
01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:03.865
Nice to meet you.

794
01:21:03.866 --> 01:21:05.658
You got one for me.

01:21:12.195 --> 01:21:14.731

LAS VEGAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS

800
01:21:46.711 --> 01:21:47.896
Yeah.

801
01:21:47.897 --> 01:21:49.491
You all set?

802
01:21:49.492 --> 01:21:51.552
Checking the departure route now.

803
01:21:51.553 --> 01:21:53.892
You won't have much time.

804
01:21:53.893 --> 01:21:55.844
They won't know
where it came from.

805
01:21:55.845 --> 01:21:58.022
I'll have enough time.

806
01:21:58.472 --> 01:22:01.507
After you take care of Kalloor,
I'll be standing left hand at my side.

807
01:22:01.508 --> 01:22:02.824
You put a bullet in it.

808
01:22:02.825 --> 01:22:05.495
It's better if I'm a target too.

809
01:22:05.762 --> 01:22:07.273
Copy that.

810
01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.325
Lee.

811
01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:53.153
The Director wants a word
before you go onstage.

812
01:22:53.632 --> 01:22:55.368
Of course.

Heather.

817
01:23:47.926 --> 01:23:51.245
My protege,
and strongest supporter,

818
01:23:51.253 --> 01:23:52.956
You know, after what happened
in London,

819
01:23:52.957 --> 01:23:54.630
I did not know
what to do with you.

820
01:23:54.631 --> 01:23:57.040
I suppose we'll just uh...

821
01:23:57.041 --> 01:24:00.218
Write it off to your
learning curve.

822
01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:02.312
I'd appreciate that.

823
01:24:02.867 --> 01:24:06.325
At least you can now see
that you never had a chance.

824
01:24:06.326 --> 01:24:08.041
When Bourne turns up again,

825
01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:09.213
I'll deal with him.

826
01:24:09.214 --> 01:24:10.991
Do you understand?

827
01:24:10.992 --> 01:24:12.681
Of course.

828
01:24:12.682 --> 01:24:14.872
I agree completely.

829
01:24:16.982 --> 01:24:19.620
When we get onstage,
I'll handle all the policy questions.

830
01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:21.741
Throw everything technical to you.

831
01:24:21.742 --> 01:24:24.994
- I'll be ready, sir.
- Okay, let's do this.

832
01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:36.585
Badges?

833
01:24:53.927 --> 01:24:55.523
Aaron.

834
01:24:55.524 --> 01:24:57.172
Robert.

835
01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.180
You know Heather Lee.

836
01:25:03.824 --> 01:25:06.467
Yeah, we went to Stanford together.

837
01:25:06.727 --> 01:25:09.548
Well. How are you enjoying
life at the Agency?

838
01:25:09.549 --> 01:25:12.480
Challenging, but fulfilling.

839
01:25:12.892 --> 01:25:15.971
It's tough to stick to all
your principles over there?

840
01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:19.162
My principles are just fine, thanks.

841
01:25:19.977 --> 01:25:22.663
Gentlemen, we're ready for you.
Follow me, please.

842
01:25:22.664 --> 01:25:24.764
I'm going to enjoy this.

843
01:25:24.772 --> 01:25:26.338
So am I.

844
01:25:39.969 --> 01:25:41.573

Oh. Hi!
How's everyone doing tonight?

847
01:26:05.933 --> 01:26:07.588
Welcome.

848
01:26:09.921 --> 01:26:11.669
Welcome.

849
01:26:12.749 --> 01:26:16.852
Welcome to tonight's EXOCON symposium.

850
01:26:16.853 --> 01:26:21.254
We are so lucky to have 4
fantastic guests this evening.

851
01:26:21.255 --> 01:26:24.916
The CIA Director,
Robert Dewey is here.

852
01:26:26.741 --> 01:26:30.371
And a dear friend of mine,
and an old friend of EXOCON,

853
01:26:30.372 --> 01:26:35.880
the CEO of social media giant,
Deep Dream, Aaron Kalloor is here.

854
01:27:08.307 --> 01:27:09.901
Tonight.

855
01:27:10.872 --> 01:27:12.986
Policing a free internet.

856
01:27:12.987 --> 01:27:16.346
Personal rights vs Public safety.

857
01:27:16.347 --> 01:27:18.844
This is the great question
of our time.

858
01:27:18.845 --> 01:27:22.386
And the choices we make about
this will determine our future.

859
01:27:22.387 --> 01:27:25.210
So let's just dive right in, okay?

860
01:27:26.869 --> 01:27:28.573
Come on out here, guys!

861
01:27:28.574 --> 01:27:31.181
Sir, you got an incoming message.

862
01:27:31.182 --> 01:27:32.919
High priority.

863
01:27:33.242 --> 01:27:35.242
Alright guys, I'm going
to have to take this.

864
01:27:35.243 --> 01:27:37.180
I'll catch up with you later.

865
01:27:37.181 --> 01:27:38.772
Go ahead.

866
01:27:46.445 --> 01:27:48.596
- Thank you.
- Good morning.

867
01:27:58.432 --> 01:28:01.054
It appears Director Dewey
is held up momentarily,

868
01:28:01.055 --> 01:28:04.766
and I'm being told that
it shouldn't be too much longer.

869
01:28:04.767 --> 01:28:08.057
But we have a ton of stuff to get
into tonight, so we can start anyway.

870
01:28:08.058 --> 01:28:09.871
Uh Brad, can I say a few words?

871
01:28:09.872 --> 01:28:12.031
- Excuse me?
- Can I get the ball rolling?

872
01:28:12.032 --> 01:28:13.466
Oh sure, man.
By all means.

873
01:28:13.467 --> 01:28:16.082
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Kalloor.

874
01:28:25.883 --> 01:28:27.061
Aaron!

875
01:28:27.062 --> 01:28:28.917
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

876
01:28:29.483 --> 01:28:30.440
Thanks a lot.

877
01:28:30.441 --> 01:28:33.424
Thanks Brad and ExoCon
for having us back.

878
01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:36.141
And to you guys turning out.

879
01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:39.071
Before the Director
comes out to join us,

880
01:28:39.072 --> 01:28:41.921
I just wanted to share a
few words with you guys.

881
01:28:41.922 --> 01:28:44.731
A long time ago,
I had this idea.

882
01:28:44.732 --> 01:28:46.479
Copy that.

883
01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:48.839
Facial recognition got a hit.

884
01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:51.105
Bourne was on a B.A. flight
from Heathrow to Vegas.

885
01:28:51.106 --> 01:28:53.302
It landed 2 hours ago.

886
01:28:53.642 --> 01:28:55.541
How the hell did he
get through immigration?

887
01:28:55.542 --> 01:28:59.528
Someone issued him an Agency
security clearance on his passport.

888
01:29:00.378 --> 01:29:03.507
Well it turned out to be
a pretty popular idea.

889
01:29:04.203 --> 01:29:07.453
People from around the world
started using our service.

890
01:29:14.763 --> 01:29:17.689
SOMETHING's WRONG

891
01:29:18.994 --> 01:29:20.546
Well, first off.

892
01:29:20.547 --> 01:29:23.272
This has all made me a lot
more rich than it's probably...

893
01:29:23.273 --> 01:29:27.961
When I come onstage, take care
of Kalloor and the girl.

894
01:29:27.962 --> 01:29:29.389
Copy.

895
01:29:29.702 --> 01:29:31.277
What I mean to say is,
you know.

896
01:29:31.278 --> 01:29:33.788
All this success has come at a cost.

897
01:29:34.002 --> 01:29:38.739
There is a cancer at the
heart of Deep Dream.

898
01:29:39.172 --> 01:29:42.362
A guilty secret
and uh...

899
01:29:42.363 --> 01:29:44.071
and I have to share it
with all of you guys.

900
01:29:44.072 --> 01:29:45.475
The son of a bitch is
about to take us down.

901
01:29:45.476 --> 01:29:47.930
Take out Kalloor and
the girl right now.

902
01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:53.183
Whoa.
Whoa.

903
01:29:53.184 --> 01:29:54.757
- Stay there.
- Okay.

904
01:29:55.879 --> 01:29:58.905
When I was starting out,
I...

905
01:29:59.170 --> 01:30:02.343
I took money to...
start my company.

906
01:30:04.041 --> 01:30:07.169
I made a bargain with
a guy in the dark suit.

907
01:30:09.359 --> 01:30:12.390
And now he's come back
to take my soul.

908
01:30:20.428 --> 01:30:21.645
I see the shooter!

909
01:30:21.646 --> 01:30:23.511
We got eyes on Jason Bourne!

910
01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:26.070
He's still breathing,
call an ambulance!

911
01:30:27.471 --> 01:30:28.633
Let's go!

912
01:30:28.634 --> 01:30:30.367
Sir, we got to go.

913
01:30:42.564 --> 01:30:44.366
Head for the exit.

914
01:30:47.316 --> 01:30:49.181
This is Vasquez.
We're on Bourne.

915
01:30:49.182 --> 01:30:50.789
- Get the cars ready!
- Go!

916
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:52.726
Get the cars ready, right now!

917
01:30:52.727 --> 01:30:54.081
No.
Take me to the suite.

918
01:30:54.082 --> 01:30:56.355
Sir, we got to get you out of here.
Bourne is on the loose.

919
01:30:56.356 --> 01:30:57.971
You heard me.

920
01:30:57.972 --> 01:30:59.850
Take me to the suite.

921
01:30:59.851 --> 01:31:00.771
Yes, sir.

922
01:31:00.772 --> 01:31:03.101
Take him to the suite!
Take him upstairs!

923
01:31:03.102 --> 01:31:05.511
Get him upstairs.
Right now! Right now!

924
01:31:05.512 --> 01:31:07.212
Up to the suite!

925
01:31:07.213 --> 01:31:09.586
Let's go, right now.
Go, go, go, go.

926
01:31:16.979 --> 01:31:19.159
Out of the way, federal agent!

927
01:31:27.075 --> 01:31:29.117
Vasquez, sitrep.

928
01:31:29.146 --> 01:31:31.195
Vasquez, come in.

929
01:31:33.263 --> 01:31:34.741
Hey!

930
01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:55.098
Okay, we've got him.
Sir, this is Collier.

931
01:31:55.099 --> 01:31:56.501
We've IDed the sniper.

932
01:31:56.502 --> 01:31:57.436
Shit!

933
01:31:57.437 --> 01:31:59.030
We're circulating his photo now.

934
01:31:59.031 --> 01:32:00.362
What about Bourne?

935
01:32:00.363 --> 01:32:02.010
Hang on.

936
01:32:02.322 --> 01:32:06.044
Okay, Bourne is just leaving the west
service corridor heading for the lobby.

937
01:32:06.045 --> 01:32:08.359
Copy that.
Stay on Bourne.

938
01:32:10.450 --> 01:32:11.520
What?

939
01:32:11.521 --> 01:32:13.033
We're still looking for Bourne.

940
01:32:13.034 --> 01:32:15.363
And they've IDed the asset.

941
01:32:32.032 --> 01:32:34.274
Go back to the first floor and
wait for further instructions.

942
01:32:34.275 --> 01:32:36.200
- Yes, sir.
- Copy that.

943
01:32:53.084 --> 01:32:55.344
Everybody down!
Right now!

944
01:32:55.345 --> 01:32:57.792
Get down!
Move, move, move!

945
01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:01.072
Out of the way!
Federal agent, move!

946
01:33:23.544 --> 01:33:26.892
Take a team to the northeast elevator.
I'll meet you up there.

947
01:33:33.944 --> 01:33:36.234
Bourne's on his way up to you.

948
01:34:25.889 --> 01:34:28.511
You took a long time
to get here, Jason.

949
01:34:29.531 --> 01:34:31.515
I know about Beirut.

950
01:34:31.952 --> 01:34:33.905
I know what you did.

951
01:34:34.942 --> 01:34:37.050
It all ends tonight.

952
01:34:37.354 --> 01:34:40.140
Be a lot easier
to do it right away.

953
01:34:47.059 --> 01:34:48.791
You didn't come here for revenge.

954
01:34:48.792 --> 01:34:51.806
You came here because
you know it's time to come in.

955
01:34:59.521 --> 01:35:02.079
Your father created the program.

956
01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:05.011
Didn't have what it
takes to make it work.

957
01:35:05.012 --> 01:35:06.816
And you did.

958
01:35:07.185 --> 01:35:09.091
You always did.

959
01:35:11.132 --> 01:35:12.582
That's why you volunteered.

960
01:35:12.583 --> 01:35:15.730
I volunteered because I thought
our enemies killed him.

961
01:35:17.124 --> 01:35:18.861
I volunteered because of a lie.

962
01:35:18.862 --> 01:35:21.804
No.
You volunteered because of who you are.

963
01:35:21.805 --> 01:35:23.944
You volunteered because
you are Jason Bourne.

964
01:35:23.945 --> 01:35:27.258
And not,
David Webb.

965
01:35:36.542 --> 01:35:38.700
32 kills, Jason.

966
01:35:38.701 --> 01:35:40.409
Every one of them made a difference.

967
01:35:40.410 --> 01:35:45.276
People all across this country are
safer because of what you did.

968
01:35:56.314 --> 01:35:58.906
Try to find another way.

969
01:36:02.252 --> 01:36:04.739
And how's that working out for you?

970
01:36:12.342 --> 01:36:14.951
You're never going to
find any peace.

971
01:36:15.906 --> 01:36:19.836
Not until you admit to yourself
who you really are.

972
01:36:21.362 --> 01:36:23.790
It's time to come in, Jason.

973
01:36:25.072 --> 01:36:27.098
It's time to come in.

974
01:36:33.033 --> 01:36:34.773
I can't.

975
01:36:39.886 --> 01:36:41.766
Not for you.

976
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:18.328
You were never here.

977
01:37:25.811 --> 01:37:27.956
You don't have to
go after him.

978
01:37:30.582 --> 01:37:32.672
This can stop now.

979
01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:35.261
You have a choice.

980
01:37:57.764 --> 01:37:59.538
Let's go, have your IDs ready!

981
01:37:59.539 --> 01:38:01.394
Have your IDs ready.

982
01:38:02.604 --> 01:38:04.409
Let's go.
Have your IDs ready.

983
01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:06.659
Come on, guys.
Let's go. Let's go.

984
01:38:12.587 --> 01:38:13.932
Go stand at the lobby.

985
01:38:13.933 --> 01:38:16.794
Las Vegas police,
ladies and gentlemen.

986
01:38:58.378 --> 01:39:03.504
...was spotted in unmarked black Dodge Charger
stolen from in front of the Aria.

987
01:39:12.215 --> 01:39:14.041
Forward that ID.

988
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:27.710
- Stop it!
- Don't let it through!

989
01:43:30.244 --> 01:43:31.864
Oh my god!

990
01:43:33.744 --> 01:43:35.186
Fire!

991
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.563
Move out!

992
01:44:23.842 --> 01:44:25.170
Move!

993
01:44:27.617 --> 01:44:30.321
911, to air units involve, identify.

994
01:44:30.322 --> 01:44:33.053
This is Air One, be advised,
suspect vehicles have crashed

995
01:44:33.054 --> 01:44:35.721
into the southeast entrance
of the Riviera.

996
01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:50.597
We have an armed suspect heading into
the storm drain, south of the Riviera.

997
01:46:39.842 --> 01:46:43.246
You're a traitor.
You've always been a traitor.

998
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:46.114
It's in your blood.

999
01:48:09.230 --> 01:48:11.977
- Mr. Kalloor.
- Kalloor.

1000
01:48:12.136 --> 01:48:14.817
Aaron, what were you going to
tell everyone in the convention?

1001
01:48:14.818 --> 01:48:17.711
- What are you hiding, Aaron?
- What were you going to tell everyone?

1002
01:48:17.712 --> 01:48:19.674
Why did somebody try to
assassinate you?

1003
01:48:19.675 --> 01:48:22.379
Aaron, what's the cancer
at the heart of Deep Dream?

1004
01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:25.087
It'll be inappropriate to pass
any comment at this stage.

1005
01:48:25.088 --> 01:48:28.917
But, I look forward to working with the
authorities to find out who is responsible.

1006
01:48:28.918 --> 01:48:31.834
And in getting back to Deep Dream,
where we can continue our important work.

1007
01:48:31.835 --> 01:48:33.279
Thank you.

1008
01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:35.659
Have you been lying to your users?

1009
01:49:06.828 --> 01:49:08.378
Sir.

1010
01:49:17.862 --> 01:49:20.348
I wanted to say I'm sorry, sir.

1011
01:49:20.357 --> 01:49:22.313
About Vegas.

1012
01:49:22.375 --> 01:49:25.795
Director Dewey's tactics were unwise.

1013
01:49:25.796 --> 01:49:27.557
Unwise?

1014
01:49:28.339 --> 01:49:31.631
We're still trying to come up with a
narrative to explain what happened.

1015
01:49:31.632 --> 01:49:36.239
That son of a bitch put
a spotlight on Iron Hand.

1016
01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:38.092
On all of us.

1017
01:49:38.093 --> 01:49:40.611
Kalloor hasn't gone public yet.

1018
01:49:41.942 --> 01:49:43.733
I know Aaron.

1019
01:49:44.293 --> 01:49:46.879
There's still moves we
can make with him.

1020
01:49:49.532 --> 01:49:51.121
Tell me.

1021
01:49:51.324 --> 01:49:54.705
Dewey's problem was that
he belonged to the past.

1022
01:49:55.801 --> 01:49:58.731
People like Kalloor are
shaping the future.

1023
01:49:58.732 --> 01:50:00.776
These are my people.

1024
01:50:01.512 --> 01:50:03.735
I know how to deal with them.

1025
01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:08.599
And what do you want?

1026
01:50:09.504 --> 01:50:11.559
When you appoint a
new Agency Director

1027
01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:14.955
You're going to need someone
working for your interests.

1028
01:50:15.689 --> 01:50:17.289
Someone...

1029
01:50:17.946 --> 01:50:20.819
empowered... by you.

1030
01:50:23.812 --> 01:50:25.790
What about Bourne?

1031
01:50:26.453 --> 01:50:28.920
You still think
you can bring him in?

1032
01:50:31.462 --> 01:50:33.402
I have his trust.

1033
01:50:33.892 --> 01:50:36.097
After what we went through.

1034
01:50:36.822 --> 01:50:38.631
I'll bring him in.

1035
01:50:38.632 --> 01:50:40.694
I'm certain of it.

1036
01:50:42.702 --> 01:50:44.454
And if you can't?

1037
01:50:46.093 --> 01:50:47.793
Then...

1038
01:50:48.212 --> 01:50:50.472
he'll have to be put down.

1039
01:50:53.462 --> 01:50:55.960
That's an interesting proposal.

1040
01:51:00.618 --> 01:51:02.840
You can pull over here.

1041
01:51:07.027 --> 01:51:10.444
Of course if you decide that
you don't need me, then...

1042
01:51:10.532 --> 01:51:12.221
That's not a problem.

1043
01:51:12.222 --> 01:51:15.613
There are many other agencies
that would want what I know.

1044
01:51:45.022 --> 01:51:47.086
I brought you something.

1045
01:51:52.122 --> 01:51:56.787
It's a cast from you father's star,
on the Memorial Wall at Langley.

1046
01:52:01.658 --> 01:52:04.110
Richard Webb
10-20-48

1047
01:52:06.433 --> 01:52:08.975
I'm sorry for what
happened to you.

1048
01:52:11.124 --> 01:52:12.926
How you were treated.

1049
01:52:12.927 --> 01:52:15.370
But the people who
did that are gone.

1050
01:52:15.371 --> 01:52:16.906
And...

1051
01:52:16.907 --> 01:52:19.081
things are changing at the Agency.

1052
01:52:19.082 --> 01:52:21.036
What is it you want?

1053
01:52:24.009 --> 01:52:26.901
I know you've always been a patriot.

1054
01:52:27.629 --> 01:52:31.362
And what happens to this
country, matters to you.

1055
01:52:32.052 --> 01:52:34.602
We need you to help protect us.

1056
01:52:35.657 --> 01:52:37.381
Come back in.

1057
01:52:39.067 --> 01:52:41.165
And we'll work together.

1058
01:52:48.746 --> 01:52:50.750
Let me think about it.

1059
01:52:51.562 --> 01:52:53.744
How will I find you?

1060
01:53:39.572 --> 01:53:41.711
You still think
you can bring him in?

1061
01:53:41.712 --> 01:53:43.654
I have his trust.

1062
01:53:44.118 --> 01:53:46.300
After what we went through.

1063
01:53:46.851 --> 01:53:48.677
I'll bring him in.

1064
01:53:48.752 --> 01:53:50.845
I'm certain of it.

1065
01:53:51.167 --> 01:53:53.154
And if you can't?

1066
01:53:54.674 --> 01:53:56.174
