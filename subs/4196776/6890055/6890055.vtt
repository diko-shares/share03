00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.876
There is an argument for catching
Bourne instead of killing him.

534
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.912
All right, let's hear it.

535
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.918
Bourne's been off
the grid for a long time.

536
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.514
He's been hiding in the shadows,
he's seen things.

537
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.955
He knows things
that could help us.

538
00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.998
Bringing him back in
is the smart move.

539
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.633

going to do that?

left the program.

542
00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.599
He concluded Bourne is
still a patriot at heart,

543
00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:03.874
and that leaving
the program

544
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.076
could come back
to haunt him.

545
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.592

suggesting?

546
00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.035
I watched Bourne
with those files.

Desperately
looking into his past.

548
00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:18.551
And I think he's
at a tipping point.

549
00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.279
If I could get
face-to-face with him,

550
00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.998
I think I can
bring him back in.

551
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.869
