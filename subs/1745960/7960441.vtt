00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.030
<i>Today, we're looking at
some of the hottest weather</i>

2
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.510
<i>we've had so far this year.</i>

3
00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:05.989
Hey.

4
00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:11.909
What is it?

5
00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:15.189
What?

6
00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:18.549
We've been ordered to stand down.
They're scrapping the program.

7
00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:21.909
They say we fell short.

8
00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:23.989
The contract threshold is Mach 10.

9
00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.229
Mach 10 is supposed to be
in two months.

10
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:28.629
Today's test point is Mach 9.

11
00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:30.269
Well, that's not good enough.

12
00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:31.949
Says who?

13
00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:33.269
Admiral Cain.

14
00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:35.989
The Drone Ranger.

15
00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:38.709
He wants our budget
for his unmanned program.

16
00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.109
He's on his way to kill the test
and shut us down personally.

17
00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.389
Well, he isn't here yet.

18
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.149
They want Mach 10...

19
00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:05.349
let's give them Mach 10.

20
00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.829
Now remember,
the contract threshold is Mach 10.

21
00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:29.549
Not 10.1, not 10.2. Mach 10.

22
00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:31.469
That should keep the program alive.

23
00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:36.429
I don't like that look, Mav.

24
00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:39.509
It's the only one I got.

25
00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:51.228
Control, this is Darkstar.
How do you read?

26
00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:53.908
Darkstar, Control.
Loud and clear. How me?

27
00:06:53.988 --> 00:06:56.148
<i>Loud and clear.
Takeoff precheck's complete.</i>

28
00:06:56.228 --> 00:06:57.348
Ready for APU start.

29
00:06:58.668 --> 00:06:59.988
<i>Ready left engine start.</i>

30
00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:02.988
<i>Ready right engine start.</i>

31
00:07:04.548 --> 00:07:05.548
Thumbs for taxi.

32
00:07:08.108 --> 00:07:09.228
We are ready for taxi.

33
00:07:11.388 --> 00:07:12.548
Tower, this is Darkstar.

34
00:07:12.628 --> 00:07:14.708
We are taxiing
with information Alpha.

35
00:07:14.788 --> 00:07:16.548
<i>Darkstar, you are clear to taxi.</i>

36
00:07:16.628 --> 00:07:19.748
<i>Runway 21. Winds 210, 10.</i>

37
00:07:19.828 --> 00:07:21.308
Okay, fuel temps are looking good.

38
00:07:21.388 --> 00:07:22.388
<i>Control concurs.</i>

39
00:07:22.468 --> 00:07:25.228
<i>Battery's holding at 95%.
Cabin pressure looks good.</i>

40
00:07:25.308 --> 00:07:26.348
<i>Control concurs.</i>

41
00:07:26.428 --> 00:07:28.228
<i>Tower, this is Darkstar.
We're ready for takeoff.</i>

42
00:07:28.308 --> 00:07:31.188
<i>Requesting an unrestricted climb
to 600 and above.</i>

43
00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:33.628
<i>Darkstar, the runway
and skies are yours.</i>

44
00:07:34.228 --> 00:07:35.468
Rear Admiral Chester Cain.

45
00:07:36.468 --> 00:07:38.748
Maverick, Cain just
pulled up to the gate.

46
00:07:39.868 --> 00:07:41.268
It's not too late to stop, buddy.

47
00:07:42.508 --> 00:07:44.628
<i>You know what happens to you
if you go through with this.</i>

48
00:07:47.188 --> 00:07:49.348
I know what happens
to everyone else if I don't.

49
00:07:52.068 --> 00:07:53.548
<i>Darkstar is ready for takeoff.</i>

50
00:07:56.828 --> 00:07:59.588
Everyone, go for takeoff.

51
00:07:59.668 --> 00:08:00.668
Starting with engine.

52
00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:02.588
- Engine, go.
- Thermals, go.

53
00:08:02.668 --> 00:08:04.668
- Fuel, go.
- Electric, go.

54
00:08:04.748 --> 00:08:06.228
Control surfaces, go.

55
00:08:06.308 --> 00:08:08.948
<i>Darkstar, Control.
You're cleared for takeoff.</i>

56
00:08:09.028 --> 00:08:10.068
All right, sweetheart.

57
00:08:11.428 --> 00:08:12.428
One last ride.

58
00:08:37.988 --> 00:08:40.428
<i>Darkstar, you are cleared above 600.</i>

59
00:08:40.508 --> 00:08:42.148
<i>Increase to Mach 3.5.</i>

60
00:08:42.228 --> 00:08:45.828
Cleared above 600.
Increase to Mach 3.5.

61
00:08:52.428 --> 00:08:53.428
Admiral.

62
00:08:54.308 --> 00:08:55.308
Just in time, sir.

63
00:08:55.388 --> 00:08:56.748
I'm early. So are you.

64
00:08:57.028 --> 00:08:58.068
You care to explain?

65
00:08:58.468 --> 00:08:59.748
Transitioning to scramjet.

66
00:09:14.868 --> 00:09:16.548
Mav, Admiral Cain is asking...

67
00:09:16.628 --> 00:09:18.428
- Ordering.
- Ordering that we bring her down.

68
00:09:27.588 --> 00:09:29.308
This is where we've had trouble
with comms, sir.

69
00:09:29.388 --> 00:09:30.668
It's the Earth's curvature.

70
00:09:30.748 --> 00:09:32.148
Yeah, it's called "Earth Bulge."

71
00:09:32.228 --> 00:09:33.508
Did anyone offer you a coffee?

72
00:09:35.148 --> 00:09:36.148
Okay.

73
00:09:44.068 --> 00:09:45.948
He's at Mach 7, pushing 8.

74
00:09:46.028 --> 00:09:48.228
- Flight data?
- Receiving. Data is good.

75
00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:56.107
Temperature's climbing.
Response is still stable.

76
00:09:56.187 --> 00:09:57.187
We're feeling good.

77
00:10:00.787 --> 00:10:01.907
<i>Mach 8.8...</i>

78
00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:03.747
8.9.

79
00:10:04.507 --> 00:10:05.507
Mach 9.

80
00:10:05.867 --> 00:10:07.467
He's the fastest man alive.

81
00:10:26.907 --> 00:10:27.907
Talk to me, Goose.

82
00:10:30.307 --> 00:10:31.347
Mach 9.1...

83
00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:33.667
9.2.

84
00:10:40.827 --> 00:10:42.027
Mach 9.3...

85
00:10:44.827 --> 00:10:45.867
9.4.

86
00:10:47.627 --> 00:10:49.147
Approaching high hypersonic.

87
00:11:01.947 --> 00:11:03.187
Windshield hot caution.

88
00:11:12.707 --> 00:11:13.787
Surface temp rising.

89
00:11:19.747 --> 00:11:21.347
Come on, sweetheart.
Just a little more.

90
00:11:22.347 --> 00:11:23.347
Just a little.

91
00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:28.387
Come on.

92
00:11:34.907 --> 00:11:35.907
Come on!

93
00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.107
- Mach 10!
- Yes!

94
00:11:44.987 --> 00:11:46.667
Put that in your Pentagon budget.

95
00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:49.507
Sir.

96
00:12:00.867 --> 00:12:02.547
Oh, don't do it. Don't do it.

97
00:12:02.627 --> 00:12:03.707
Just...

98
00:12:05.627 --> 00:12:07.707
a little push.

99
00:12:11.707 --> 00:12:13.267
Holy shit.

100
00:12:23.387 --> 00:12:25.787
You got some balls, stick jockey.

101
00:12:26.467 --> 00:12:27.547
I'll give you that.

102
00:12:31.907 --> 00:12:32.907
Oh, shit.

103
00:12:38.387 --> 00:12:39.387
Maverick.

104
00:12:41.467 --> 00:12:42.467
Maverick.

105
00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:33.746
Thank you.

106
00:13:34.746 --> 00:13:35.746
Where am I?

107
00:13:37.426 --> 00:13:38.426
Earth.

108
00:13:53.226 --> 00:13:54.226
Maverick.

109
00:13:55.306 --> 00:13:57.026
Thirty-plus years of service.

110
00:13:58.226 --> 00:13:59.706
Combat medals.

111
00:13:59.786 --> 00:14:00.986
Citations.

112
00:14:01.706 --> 00:14:04.026
Only man to shoot down
three enemy planes

113
00:14:04.106 --> 00:14:05.866
in the last 40 years.

114
00:14:06.746 --> 00:14:07.906
"Distinguished.

115
00:14:08.266 --> 00:14:09.506
Distinguished.

116
00:14:10.466 --> 00:14:11.586
Distinguished."

117
00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:16.586
Yet you can't get a promotion,
you won't retire

118
00:14:16.986 --> 00:14:19.746
and despite your best efforts,
you refuse to die.

119
00:14:20.546 --> 00:14:23.146
You should be at least
a two-star admiral by now

120
00:14:23.586 --> 00:14:24.706
if not a senator.

121
00:14:25.626 --> 00:14:26.746
Yet here you are.

122
00:14:28.466 --> 00:14:29.466
Captain.

123
00:14:30.546 --> 00:14:31.546
Why is that?

124
00:14:33.026 --> 00:14:34.386
It's one of life's mysteries, sir.

125
00:14:34.786 --> 00:14:37.426
This isn't a joke.
I asked you a question.

126
00:14:39.786 --> 00:14:41.346
I'm where I belong, sir.

127
00:14:42.186 --> 00:14:44.786
Well, the Navy
doesn't see it that way.

128
00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:46.866
Not anymore.

129
00:14:48.386 --> 00:14:51.546
These planes
you've been testing, Captain

130
00:14:52.346 --> 00:14:55.426
one day, sooner than later,
they won't need pilots at all.

131
00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:59.546
Pilots that need to sleep,
eat, take a piss.

132
00:15:01.746 --> 00:15:03.826
Pilots that disobey orders.

133
00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:08.266
All you did was buy some time
for those men out there.

134
00:15:10.426 --> 00:15:11.826
The future is coming...

135
00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:13.986
and you're not in it.

136
00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.626
Escort this man off the base.

137
00:15:19.746 --> 00:15:21.226
Take him to his quarters.

138
00:15:21.746 --> 00:15:23.866
Wait with him
while he packs his gear.

139
00:15:26.306 --> 00:15:29.146
I want him on the road
to North Island within the hour.

140
00:15:33.026 --> 00:15:34.226
North Island, sir?

141
00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.746
Call came in with impeccable timing

142
00:15:37.826 --> 00:15:40.986
right as I was driving here
to ground your ass once and for all.

143
00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:45.546
It... It galls me to say it, but...

144
00:15:46.986 --> 00:15:49.226
for reasons known only
to the Almighty

145
00:15:49.306 --> 00:15:50.746
and your guardian angel...

146
00:15:52.706 --> 00:15:54.946
you've been called back to Top Gun.

147
00:15:59.266 --> 00:16:02.306
- Sir?
- You are dismissed, Captain.

148
00:16:08.026 --> 00:16:09.786
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

149
00:16:10.746 --> 00:16:12.546
Your kind is headed for extinction.

150
00:16:16.546 --> 00:16:17.545
Maybe so, sir.

151
00:16:19.585 --> 00:16:20.625
But not today.

152
00:17:26.225 --> 00:17:28.785
Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell.

153
00:17:30.065 --> 00:17:31.505
Your reputation precedes you.

154
00:17:32.945 --> 00:17:33.945
Thank you, sir.

155
00:17:35.385 --> 00:17:36.385
Wasn't a compliment.

156
00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:40.665
I'm Admiral Beau Simpson.
I'm the Air Boss.

157
00:17:40.745 --> 00:17:41.785
I believe you know Admiral Bates.

158
00:17:42.665 --> 00:17:43.785
Warlock, sir.

159
00:17:43.865 --> 00:17:46.345
Must admit, I wasn't expecting
an invitation back.

160
00:17:46.425 --> 00:17:47.945
They're called orders, Maverick.

161
00:17:49.465 --> 00:17:51.065
You two have something in common.

162
00:17:51.145 --> 00:17:53.505
Cyclone here was first
in his class back in '88.

163
00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:55.945
Actually, sir, I finished second.

164
00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:58.145
Just want to manage expectations.

165
00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:04.105
The target...

166
00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:08.865
is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant

167
00:18:08.945 --> 00:18:11.505
built in violation
of a multilateral NATO treaty.

168
00:18:11.745 --> 00:18:14.585
The uranium produced there
represents a direct threat

169
00:18:14.665 --> 00:18:16.145
to our allies in the region.

170
00:18:16.225 --> 00:18:18.865
The Pentagon has tasked us
with assembling a strike team

171
00:18:18.945 --> 00:18:19.945
and taking it out

172
00:18:20.345 --> 00:18:21.825
before it becomes fully operational.

173
00:18:23.025 --> 00:18:25.345
The plant sits
in an underground bunker

174
00:18:25.425 --> 00:18:26.545
at the end of this valley.

175
00:18:27.025 --> 00:18:28.745
Said valley is GPS-jammed

176
00:18:28.825 --> 00:18:31.585
and defended by an extensive
surface-to-air missile array

177
00:18:31.665 --> 00:18:34.225
serving a limited number
of fifth-generation fighters

178
00:18:34.305 --> 00:18:35.505
which, in turn, are backed up

179
00:18:35.585 --> 00:18:38.025
by a plentiful reserve
of surplus aircraft.

180
00:18:38.545 --> 00:18:40.265
Even a few old F-14s.

181
00:18:40.945 --> 00:18:43.145
Seems like we're not the only ones
holding on to old relics.

182
00:18:45.145 --> 00:18:46.385
What's your read, Captain?

183
00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:52.705
Well, sir, normally this would be
a cakewalk for the F-35's stealth

184
00:18:52.785 --> 00:18:54.665
but the GPS-jamming negates that.

185
00:18:55.185 --> 00:18:57.145
And a surface-to-air threat
necessitates

186
00:18:57.225 --> 00:19:00.425
a low-level laser-guided strike
tailor-made for the F-18.

187
00:19:00.505 --> 00:19:01.505
I figure...

188
00:19:02.345 --> 00:19:04.345
two precision bombs, minimum.

189
00:19:04.425 --> 00:19:06.545
Makes it four aircraft
flying in pairs.

190
00:19:07.465 --> 00:19:09.385
That is one hell
of a steep climb out of there

191
00:19:09.745 --> 00:19:11.665
exposing you
to all the surface-to-air missiles.

192
00:19:12.825 --> 00:19:13.945
You survive that...

193
00:19:15.345 --> 00:19:16.945
it's a dogfight all the way home.

194
00:19:17.025 --> 00:19:19.545
All requirements for which
you have real-world experience.

195
00:19:20.265 --> 00:19:21.785
Not in the same mission, sir.

196
00:19:25.145 --> 00:19:26.145
No.

197
00:19:29.065 --> 00:19:30.624
No, someone's
not coming back from this.

198
00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:32.984
Can it be done or not?

199
00:19:33.784 --> 00:19:35.544
How soon before the plant
becomes operational?

200
00:19:35.624 --> 00:19:37.144
Three weeks. Maybe less.

201
00:19:38.864 --> 00:19:41.144
Well, it's been a while
since I've flown an F-18, and...

202
00:19:42.584 --> 00:19:44.944
I'm not sure who I'd trust
to fly the other three.

203
00:19:45.344 --> 00:19:46.944
But I'll find a way to make it work.

204
00:19:47.024 --> 00:19:48.784
I think you misunderstand, Captain.

205
00:19:49.864 --> 00:19:51.824
- Sir?
- We don't want you to fly it.

206
00:19:52.784 --> 00:19:53.904
We want you to teach it.

207
00:19:56.504 --> 00:19:57.704
Teach, sir?

208
00:19:59.384 --> 00:20:02.344
We've recalled 12 Top Gun graduates
from their squadrons.

209
00:20:02.904 --> 00:20:05.024
We want you to narrow
that pool down to six.

210
00:20:06.344 --> 00:20:07.464
They'll fly the mission.

211
00:20:09.904 --> 00:20:11.064
Is there a problem, Captain?

212
00:20:12.944 --> 00:20:15.144
You know there is, sir.

213
00:20:16.744 --> 00:20:17.864
Yeah.

214
00:20:17.944 --> 00:20:20.704
Bradley Bradshaw, aka "Rooster."

215
00:20:20.784 --> 00:20:22.464
I understand you used to fly
with his old man.

216
00:20:22.824 --> 00:20:23.944
What was his call sign?

217
00:20:25.144 --> 00:20:26.344
"Goose," sir.

218
00:20:26.904 --> 00:20:28.064
Tragic what happened.

219
00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:30.224
Captain Mitchell was cleared
of any wrongdoing.

220
00:20:30.304 --> 00:20:31.704
Goose's death was an accident.

221
00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:33.224
Is that how you see it, Captain?

222
00:20:34.104 --> 00:20:35.544
Is that how Goose's son sees it?

223
00:20:39.104 --> 00:20:41.984
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not a teacher.

224
00:20:42.224 --> 00:20:43.704
You were a Top Gun instructor before.

225
00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:45.664
That was almost 30 years ago.
I lasted two months.

226
00:20:46.304 --> 00:20:47.304
It's not where I belong.

227
00:20:47.624 --> 00:20:49.064
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

228
00:20:49.864 --> 00:20:51.184
You were not my first choice.

229
00:20:51.504 --> 00:20:52.784
In fact,
you weren't even on the list.

230
00:20:53.864 --> 00:20:56.224
You are here at the request
of Admiral Kazansky.

231
00:20:57.344 --> 00:21:00.784
Now, Iceman happens to be a man
I deeply admire

232
00:21:00.864 --> 00:21:03.344
and he seems to think that you have
something left to offer the Navy.

233
00:21:04.904 --> 00:21:06.144
What that is, I can't imagine.

234
00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:09.384
You don't have to take this job.

235
00:21:10.344 --> 00:21:11.384
But let me be clear.

236
00:21:11.864 --> 00:21:14.264
This will be your last post, Captain.

237
00:21:16.104 --> 00:21:17.344
You fly for Top Gun

238
00:21:17.824 --> 00:21:19.464
or you don't fly
for the Navy ever again.

239
00:21:28.264 --> 00:21:29.864
Twenty bucks
you can't get three in a row.

240
00:22:11.544 --> 00:22:13.424
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

241
00:22:16.184 --> 00:22:17.184
Pete.

242
00:22:18.824 --> 00:22:19.824
Penny?

243
00:22:20.944 --> 00:22:22.144
What are you doing here?

244
00:22:22.624 --> 00:22:24.264
I should ask you the same thing.

245
00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:26.824
That is a long story.

246
00:22:26.904 --> 00:22:28.664
- I doubt that.
- Yeah.

247
00:22:29.144 --> 00:22:30.424
Who'd you piss off this time?

248
00:22:30.784 --> 00:22:31.784
Another admiral.

249
00:22:32.224 --> 00:22:33.224
Exactly.

250
00:22:35.944 --> 00:22:38.064
- Are you mad at me?
- Oh, Pete.

251
00:22:38.984 --> 00:22:41.703
I can never stay mad at you.
That's the problem.

252
00:22:43.823 --> 00:22:44.863
I gotta say...

253
00:22:45.143 --> 00:22:46.263
North Island is the one place

254
00:22:46.343 --> 00:22:48.063
I thought for sure
I'd never run into you.

255
00:22:49.183 --> 00:22:50.183
How long you been here?

256
00:22:50.263 --> 00:22:52.063
Bought this place
about three years ago.

257
00:22:52.143 --> 00:22:53.903
- Three years?
- Yeah.

258
00:22:54.343 --> 00:22:56.343
Not long after
you got shipped off to the desert

259
00:22:56.423 --> 00:22:58.263
for pissing off that other admiral.

260
00:22:59.703 --> 00:23:00.863
That was three years ago?

261
00:23:02.703 --> 00:23:04.543
You must be in a lot of trouble.

262
00:23:05.303 --> 00:23:07.103
No way
you'd come back here willingly.

263
00:23:09.383 --> 00:23:10.383
Well...

264
00:23:11.063 --> 00:23:12.103
you'll sort it out.

265
00:23:13.343 --> 00:23:14.503
No, I think...

266
00:23:15.943 --> 00:23:17.063
I think this is it.

267
00:23:17.423 --> 00:23:18.503
Come on, Pete.

268
00:23:18.903 --> 00:23:20.583
You've been saying that
as long as I've known you.

269
00:23:21.503 --> 00:23:23.703
You said it after they busted you
for taking me on a joyride

270
00:23:23.783 --> 00:23:25.023
in that F-18.

271
00:23:25.463 --> 00:23:27.863
Then the next thing I know,
you're off to Bosnia.

272
00:23:28.743 --> 00:23:30.783
Then Iraq. Both times.

273
00:23:31.703 --> 00:23:32.943
You get yourself in trouble

274
00:23:34.063 --> 00:23:37.063
Iceman makes a call,
and you're back in the air.

275
00:23:37.143 --> 00:23:38.623
Penny, this is different.

276
00:23:38.703 --> 00:23:40.143
Pete, trust me.

277
00:23:40.543 --> 00:23:42.503
As improbable as it seems right now

278
00:23:42.583 --> 00:23:44.463
somehow, you'll be back
in a fighter plane

279
00:23:44.543 --> 00:23:45.863
with your tail on fire.

280
00:23:47.143 --> 00:23:48.503
- Penny...
- Too late.

281
00:23:49.463 --> 00:23:50.463
What?

282
00:23:50.623 --> 00:23:52.223
You were about to ask me
what time I get off.

283
00:23:56.343 --> 00:23:57.583
Don't give me that look.

284
00:23:58.743 --> 00:24:01.063
I'm not giving you any look. I swear.

285
00:24:02.103 --> 00:24:03.583
It always ends the same
with us, Pete.

286
00:24:05.863 --> 00:24:07.063
Let's not start this time.

287
00:24:12.063 --> 00:24:13.063
Okay.

288
00:24:13.983 --> 00:24:14.983
Okay.

289
00:24:19.623 --> 00:24:20.623
You look good.

290
00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:32.463
Much appreciated, pal.

291
00:24:35.543 --> 00:24:36.623
What am I missing?

292
00:24:39.103 --> 00:24:43.023
"Disrespect a lady, the navy,
or put your cell phone on my bar..."

293
00:24:43.103 --> 00:24:44.383
...and you buy a round.

294
00:24:45.583 --> 00:24:46.823
For everyone?

295
00:24:46.903 --> 00:24:49.503
I'm afraid rules are rules.
You're lucky it's early.

296
00:24:50.743 --> 00:24:51.823
Oh, come on.

297
00:24:52.903 --> 00:24:54.303
What do we have here?

298
00:24:56.503 --> 00:24:58.343
If it ain't Phoenix.

299
00:24:59.023 --> 00:25:01.063
And here I thought
we were special, Coyote.

300
00:25:02.903 --> 00:25:05.503
Turns out the invite went to anyone.

301
00:25:06.503 --> 00:25:08.103
Fellas, this here's Bagman.

302
00:25:08.183 --> 00:25:09.623
- Hangman.
- Whatever.

303
00:25:10.503 --> 00:25:12.663
You're looking at the only
naval aviator on active duty

304
00:25:12.743 --> 00:25:14.303
with a confirmed air-to-air kill.

305
00:25:14.383 --> 00:25:15.783
- Stop.
- Mind you

306
00:25:15.863 --> 00:25:18.663
the other guy was in a museum piece
from the Korean War.

307
00:25:19.303 --> 00:25:22.183
- Cold War.
- Different wars, same century.

308
00:25:22.263 --> 00:25:23.263
Not this one.

309
00:25:23.743 --> 00:25:24.943
Who are your friends?

310
00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:26.743
- Payback.
- Fanboy.

311
00:25:27.143 --> 00:25:28.583
- Hey, Coyote.
- Hey.

312
00:25:28.943 --> 00:25:30.463
- Who's he?
- Who's who?

313
00:25:33.743 --> 00:25:34.743
When did you get in?

314
00:25:35.463 --> 00:25:37.063
Oh, I've... I've been here
the whole time.

315
00:25:38.143 --> 00:25:40.143
- The man's a stealth pilot.
- Literally.

316
00:25:40.863 --> 00:25:42.583
Weapons systems officer, actually.

317
00:25:43.423 --> 00:25:44.703
With no sense of humor.

318
00:25:46.943 --> 00:25:47.943
What do they call you?

319
00:25:48.583 --> 00:25:49.583
Bob.

320
00:25:49.903 --> 00:25:51.063
No, your call sign.

321
00:25:54.142 --> 00:25:55.142
Bob.

322
00:25:55.662 --> 00:25:56.662
Bob Floyd.

323
00:25:57.582 --> 00:26:00.422
You're my new backseater?
From Lemoore?

324
00:26:01.582 --> 00:26:02.862
Looks like it. Yeah.

325
00:26:06.822 --> 00:26:07.822
Nine-ball, Bob.

326
00:26:09.142 --> 00:26:10.142
Rack them.

327
00:26:11.702 --> 00:26:12.702
Okay.

328
00:26:13.582 --> 00:26:15.262
- Penny, my dear.
- Yeah.

329
00:26:15.662 --> 00:26:17.502
I'll have four more on the old-timer.

330
00:26:34.742 --> 00:26:35.742
Bradshaw.

331
00:26:37.142 --> 00:26:38.142
Is that you?

332
00:26:44.142 --> 00:26:45.862
This is how I find out
you're stateside?

333
00:26:46.462 --> 00:26:48.062
Yeah, I just thought
I'd surprise you.

334
00:26:51.542 --> 00:26:52.942
I guess I surprised you back.

335
00:26:54.862 --> 00:26:56.702
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

336
00:26:59.262 --> 00:27:01.182
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

337
00:27:01.262 --> 00:27:02.542
Much appreciated, Pops.

338
00:27:10.902 --> 00:27:13.142
How about ringing me up
before the evening rush?

339
00:27:27.662 --> 00:27:28.662
Bradshaw.

340
00:27:29.182 --> 00:27:30.302
As I live and breathe.

341
00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:32.182
Hangman.

342
00:27:32.422 --> 00:27:34.382
You look... good.

343
00:27:35.502 --> 00:27:37.262
Well, I am good, Rooster.

344
00:27:39.502 --> 00:27:40.582
I'm very good.

345
00:27:40.662 --> 00:27:41.662
In fact...

346
00:27:41.982 --> 00:27:43.582
I am too good to be true.

347
00:27:44.342 --> 00:27:45.342
So...

348
00:27:45.862 --> 00:27:48.142
anybody know what
this special detachment is all about?

349
00:27:48.222 --> 00:27:49.582
No, a mission's a mission.

350
00:27:49.982 --> 00:27:51.022
They don't confront me.

351
00:27:51.942 --> 00:27:54.502
What I wanna know...
Who's gonna be team leader?

352
00:27:56.022 --> 00:27:59.302
And which one of y'all has
what it takes to follow me?

353
00:28:01.182 --> 00:28:03.982
Hangman, the only place
you'll lead anyone is an early grave.

354
00:28:13.622 --> 00:28:17.062
Well, anyone who follows you
is just gonna run out of fuel.

355
00:28:17.982 --> 00:28:19.782
But that's just you,
ain't it, Rooster?

356
00:28:21.062 --> 00:28:22.902
You're snug on that perch

357
00:28:23.262 --> 00:28:25.902
waiting for just the right moment...

358
00:28:28.102 --> 00:28:29.142
that never comes.

359
00:28:32.782 --> 00:28:34.142
I love this song.

360
00:28:41.942 --> 00:28:43.302
Well, he hasn't changed.

361
00:28:44.622 --> 00:28:46.502
Nope. Sure hasn't.

362
00:28:51.542 --> 00:28:52.542
Check it out.

363
00:28:53.382 --> 00:28:54.382
More patches.

364
00:28:55.262 --> 00:28:57.182
That's Harvard, Yale, Omaha.

365
00:28:57.262 --> 00:28:58.262
Shit, that's Fritz.

366
00:28:58.582 --> 00:28:59.942
What the hell
kind of mission is this?

367
00:29:01.582 --> 00:29:03.422
That's not the question
we should be asking.

368
00:29:04.422 --> 00:29:06.181
Everyone here is the best there is.

369
00:29:07.901 --> 00:29:09.541
Who the hell are they gonna get
to teach us?

370
00:29:13.141 --> 00:29:14.621
It's been declined.

371
00:29:15.581 --> 00:29:16.581
You're kidding.

372
00:29:19.821 --> 00:29:20.901
Come on!

373
00:29:31.901 --> 00:29:33.621
Hey, guys. Come on.

374
00:29:48.301 --> 00:29:49.301
How about...

375
00:29:50.941 --> 00:29:51.941
That won't cover it.

376
00:29:58.101 --> 00:29:59.741
I'll come by tomorrow
and bring you the cash.

377
00:30:00.541 --> 00:30:03.501
I'm afraid... rules are rules, Pete.

378
00:30:09.381 --> 00:30:12.501
- Overboard!
- Overboard.

379
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:14.101
- Overboard!
- Really?

380
00:30:14.181 --> 00:30:17.341
- Overboard!
- Overboard!

381
00:30:17.421 --> 00:30:20.301
- Overboard!
- Overboard!

382
00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:23.261
- Overboard!
- Overboard!

383
00:30:23.341 --> 00:30:26.021
- Overboard!
- Overboard!

384
00:30:26.101 --> 00:30:28.741
- Overboard!
- Great to see you, Pete!

385
00:30:28.821 --> 00:30:31.501
- Overboard!
- Overboard!

386
00:30:31.581 --> 00:30:34.941
- Overboard!
- Overboard! Yeah!

387
00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:37.061
Thanks for the beers.
Come back anytime.

388
00:30:48.661 --> 00:30:51.061
<i>You shake my nerves
And you rattle my brain</i>

389
00:30:51.621 --> 00:30:54.021
<i>Too much love drives a man insane</i>

390
00:30:54.541 --> 00:30:57.261
<i>You broke my will, but what a thrill</i>

391
00:30:57.341 --> 00:31:00.261
<i>Goodness gracious,
Great balls of fire</i>

392
00:31:00.621 --> 00:31:03.261
<i>I laughed at love
'Cause I thought it was funny</i>

393
00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:06.021
<i>But you came along
And you moved me, honey</i>

394
00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:09.261
<i>I changed my mind, this love is fine</i>

395
00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:12.141
<i>Goodness gracious,
Great balls of fire</i>

396
00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:14.021
<i>Kiss me, baby</i>

397
00:31:20.421 --> 00:31:22.981
<i>Goodness gracious,
Great balls of fire</i>

398
00:31:39.301 --> 00:31:42.341
<i>Altitude 8,000, 7,000!</i>

399
00:31:42.421 --> 00:31:44.861
<i>Goose, I can't reach
the ejection handle!</i>

400
00:31:44.941 --> 00:31:46.701
<i>Eject!</i>

401
00:31:52.701 --> 00:31:54.061
Goose! Oh, no!

402
00:31:54.781 --> 00:31:56.941
God, he loved flying
with you, Maverick.

403
00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.580
<i>Attention on deck!</i>

404
00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:54.580
Morning.

405
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.140
Welcome to your
special training detachment.

406
00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.500
Be seated.

407
00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.500
I'm Admiral Bates, NAWDC commander.

408
00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.420
You're all Top Gun graduates.

409
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.620
The elite.

410
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.220
The best of the best.

411
00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.620
That was yesterday.

412
00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.260
The enemy's
new fifth-generation fighter

413
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:14.940
has leveled the playing field.

414
00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.940
Details are few, but you can be sure

415
00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.180
we no longer possess
the technological advantage.

416
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.140
Success, now more than ever

417
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.140
comes down to the man
or woman in the box.

418
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.100
Half of you will make the cut.

419
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.900
One of you
will be named mission leader.

420
00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.420
The other half
will remain in reserve.

421
00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.140
Your instructor is a Top Gun graduate

422
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.780
with real-world experience
in every mission aspect

423
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.300
you will be expected to master.

424
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.660
His exploits are legendary.

425
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.060
And he's considered to be
one of the finest pilots

426
00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.620
this program has ever produced.

427
00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.220
What he has to teach you

428
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.660
may very well mean the difference
between life and death.

429
00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.420
I give you Captain Pete Mitchell.

430
00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.580
Call sign, "Maverick."

431
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.380
Good morning.

432
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.540
The F-18 NATOPS.

433
00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.380
It contains everything they want you
to know about your aircraft.

434
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.460
I'm assuming you know the book
inside and out.

435
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.100
- Damn right.
- Damn straight.

436
00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.180
You got it.

437
00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.460
So does your enemy.

438
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.460
And we're off.

439
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.100
But what the enemy doesn't know

440
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.100
is your limits.

441
00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.140
I intend to find them...

442
00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.140
test them...

443
00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.060
push beyond.

444
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.700
Today, we'll start

445
00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.020
with what you only think you know.

446
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.420
You show me what you're made of.

447
00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.820
Rooster.

448
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.220
Bradley.

449
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.060
Lieutenant Bradshaw.

450
00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.460
Yes, sir.

451
00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:16.900
Let's not do it like this.

452
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.500
You gonna wash me out?

453
00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.820
That'll be up to you, not me.

454
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.180
Am I dismissed?

455
00:35:44.139 --> 00:35:46.499
Good morning, aviators.
This is your captain speaking.

456
00:35:46.859 --> 00:35:48.659
Welcome to basic fighter maneuvers.

457
00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:53.139
<i>As briefed,
today's exercise is dog fighting.</i>

458
00:35:53.219 --> 00:35:54.859
<i>Guns only, no missiles.</i>

459
00:35:55.819 --> 00:35:58.819
We do not go below the hard deck
of 5,000 feet.

460
00:35:59.179 --> 00:36:02.099
<i>Working as a team,
you have to shoot me down, or else.</i>

461
00:36:02.179 --> 00:36:03.219
Or else what, sir?

462
00:36:03.939 --> 00:36:05.099
Or else I shoot back.

463
00:36:05.539 --> 00:36:08.419
<i>If I shoot either one of you down,
you both lose.</i>

464
00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:10.139
This guy needs an ego check.

465
00:36:10.499 --> 00:36:11.499
We'll see to that.

466
00:36:11.939 --> 00:36:13.419
So, what say we put some skin
in the game?

467
00:36:13.499 --> 00:36:14.619
What do you have in mind?

468
00:36:14.859 --> 00:36:17.499
Whoever gets shot down first
has to do 200 push-ups.

469
00:36:17.859 --> 00:36:19.819
Guys, that's a lot of push-ups.

470
00:36:19.899 --> 00:36:22.579
Well, they don't call it an exercise
for nothing, sir.

471
00:36:22.979 --> 00:36:24.619
You got yourself a deal, gentlemen.

472
00:36:24.699 --> 00:36:26.139
Fight's on. Let's turn and burn.

473
00:36:28.579 --> 00:36:29.819
Fanboy, you see him?

474
00:36:29.899 --> 00:36:32.859
Nothing on radar up ahead.
He must be somewhere behind us.

475
00:36:35.579 --> 00:36:36.979
- Damn it.
- What the hell?

476
00:36:37.059 --> 00:36:38.059
Oh, shit.

477
00:36:42.939 --> 00:36:43.939
Easy, Maverick.

478
00:36:44.019 --> 00:36:46.819
Let's try not to get fired
on the first day.

479
00:36:46.899 --> 00:36:49.819
Tally! Maverick's coming in!
Break left!

480
00:36:49.899 --> 00:36:50.899
Breaking left.

481
00:36:53.339 --> 00:36:54.739
Payback, where's your wingman?

482
00:36:55.179 --> 00:36:58.339
- Rooster, where are you?
- I got your back. I'm coming.

483
00:36:58.419 --> 00:36:59.659
Hang in there. Hang in there.

484
00:37:00.059 --> 00:37:01.419
Hurry up, man. Hurry up.

485
00:37:04.979 --> 00:37:07.059
- Payback, break right.
- Breaking right.

486
00:37:08.499 --> 00:37:11.659
Rooster just saved your life, fellas.
But it's gonna cost him.

487
00:37:11.979 --> 00:37:13.619
Not this time, old man.

488
00:37:16.499 --> 00:37:17.939
Don't let him get to you, Maverick.

489
00:37:25.139 --> 00:37:27.539
Rooster, you're too low. Pull up.
You're hitting the hard deck.

490
00:37:27.619 --> 00:37:29.779
<i>- Altitude. Altitude.</i>
- Oh, shit.

491
00:37:34.739 --> 00:37:35.739
That's a kill.

492
00:37:35.819 --> 00:37:38.019
Down. 109.

493
00:37:38.859 --> 00:37:41.099
Down. 110.

494
00:37:43.579 --> 00:37:44.819
That should be us down there.

495
00:37:45.379 --> 00:37:46.379
But it's not.

496
00:37:47.139 --> 00:37:49.019
And now you know
a little something about Rooster.

497
00:37:51.699 --> 00:37:53.899
Hey, hold that tarmac down
till we get back, brother, all right?

498
00:37:53.979 --> 00:37:55.179
Hey, get in there, boys.

499
00:37:55.259 --> 00:37:56.259
Give that to Maverick.

500
00:37:58.739 --> 00:37:59.739
- That's a kill.
- Damn!

501
00:38:01.059 --> 00:38:02.179
- Smoked.
- Damn it!

502
00:38:03.659 --> 00:38:05.579
It was all fun and games
in that selfie, wasn't it?

503
00:38:05.659 --> 00:38:07.179
- Down.
<i>- Say, Phoenix.</i>

504
00:38:07.259 --> 00:38:10.099
How's about we tell everybody
"Bob" stands for something?

505
00:38:10.179 --> 00:38:12.459
<i>- Other than Robert, I mean.</i>
- Don't take the bait, Bob.

506
00:38:12.699 --> 00:38:14.259
Wanna know why we call him Hangman?

507
00:38:14.339 --> 00:38:15.539
<i>Oh, I got it.</i>

508
00:38:15.619 --> 00:38:16.699
"Baby On Board."

509
00:38:19.339 --> 00:38:20.339
Shit.

510
00:38:22.139 --> 00:38:24.019
Greetings, aviators. Fight's on.

511
00:38:24.819 --> 00:38:26.939
<i>All right, Phoenix.
Let's take this guy out.</i>

512
00:38:27.019 --> 00:38:28.179
Watch your back, Phoenix.

513
00:38:28.259 --> 00:38:29.979
- Break right.
- Breaking right.

514
00:38:32.619 --> 00:38:33.619
Where's he going?

515
00:38:33.699 --> 00:38:36.739
That's why we call him Hangman.
He'll always hang you out to dry.

516
00:38:37.779 --> 00:38:39.059
Leaving your wingman.

517
00:38:39.139 --> 00:38:41.019
There's a strategy
I haven't seen in a while.

518
00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:43.378
He called you a man, Phoenix.
You gonna take that?

519
00:38:43.458 --> 00:38:45.018
So long as he doesn't call you a man.

520
00:38:45.378 --> 00:38:46.698
Talk to me, Bob. Where's Maverick?

521
00:38:46.778 --> 00:38:48.698
Jesus, his nose
is already coming around.

522
00:38:49.338 --> 00:38:50.578
Get him off me, Hangman.

523
00:38:50.898 --> 00:38:54.578
For all you folks at home,
this is how you bury a fossil.

524
00:38:54.658 --> 00:38:57.298
All right, Hangman.
Time to teach you a lesson.

525
00:38:57.378 --> 00:38:59.258
- You're out, Phoenix.
- Son of a bitch.

526
00:39:00.618 --> 00:39:01.618
That's it.

527
00:39:01.698 --> 00:39:03.378
Let's go, Mav.
Let's see what you got.

528
00:39:03.458 --> 00:39:04.458
Come get me.

529
00:39:06.618 --> 00:39:08.418
Evil be gone. Hangman's coming.

530
00:39:09.658 --> 00:39:11.698
Yeah, you're good.
I'll give you that.

531
00:39:18.258 --> 00:39:21.538
Shit. Phoenix, I can't see him.
How close am I?

532
00:39:21.618 --> 00:39:23.938
- Phoenix?
- I'm dead, dickhead.

533
00:39:24.338 --> 00:39:25.938
See you in the afterlife, Bagman.

534
00:39:27.618 --> 00:39:28.898
Where is he? Where is he?

535
00:39:29.778 --> 00:39:30.938
That's a kill.

536
00:39:31.618 --> 00:39:35.338
Seventy-nine, down. Eighty, down.

537
00:39:35.418 --> 00:39:36.458
<i>Let's go. Who's next?</i>

538
00:39:38.098 --> 00:39:39.738
- I got you, Omaha.
- Damn it.

539
00:39:42.458 --> 00:39:44.778
- Lights out, Coyote.
- Copy kill.

540
00:39:44.858 --> 00:39:49.178
Down, 51. Down, 52.

541
00:39:52.098 --> 00:39:55.018
So, Rooster, mind if I ask you
a personal question?

542
00:39:55.218 --> 00:39:56.338
Would it matter if I did?

543
00:39:56.938 --> 00:39:58.698
So, what's the story
with you and Maverick?

544
00:39:58.978 --> 00:40:00.618
It seems like
he's got you a little rattled.

545
00:40:00.938 --> 00:40:01.978
That's none of your business.

546
00:40:02.058 --> 00:40:03.258
Now where the hell is he?

547
00:40:03.538 --> 00:40:04.698
<i>Been here the whole time.</i>

548
00:40:06.538 --> 00:40:08.538
Holy shit.

549
00:40:10.818 --> 00:40:11.818
You see me now?

550
00:40:12.778 --> 00:40:14.298
Come on, let's get it over with.

551
00:40:15.178 --> 00:40:16.178
Fight's on.

552
00:40:18.618 --> 00:40:20.578
What is with these two?

553
00:40:25.298 --> 00:40:27.298
All right, you put us here.

554
00:40:27.378 --> 00:40:28.658
How you gonna get yourself out?

555
00:40:29.298 --> 00:40:30.898
You can bail out anytime.

556
00:40:31.258 --> 00:40:32.778
How low you want to go, Rooster?

557
00:40:32.858 --> 00:40:36.058
I can go as low as you, sir.
And that's saying something.

558
00:40:39.858 --> 00:40:42.218
What's past is past. For both of us.

559
00:40:42.298 --> 00:40:43.818
You'd like to believe that,
wouldn't you?

560
00:40:43.898 --> 00:40:47.018
Hard deck is 5,000 feet, fellas.
You are running out of room.

561
00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:49.298
<i>- Altitude.</i>
- Your strategy

562
00:40:49.378 --> 00:40:50.818
is about to run us into the ground.

563
00:40:50.898 --> 00:40:53.578
- What's your move?
<i>- Altitude. Altitude.</i>

564
00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:55.138
<i>Altitude.</i>

565
00:40:56.898 --> 00:40:59.778
<i>Altitude...</i>

566
00:41:00.338 --> 00:41:02.218
<i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

567
00:41:04.298 --> 00:41:05.618
<i>Pull up. Pull up.</i>

568
00:41:05.698 --> 00:41:06.938
<i>Pull up. Pull up.</i>

569
00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:08.698
<i>Pull up. Pull up.</i>

570
00:41:12.218 --> 00:41:13.618
Hey, you got it.
Don't think, just do.

571
00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:17.378
Come on, Rooster, you got him.
Drop down and take the shot.

572
00:41:18.938 --> 00:41:19.938
It's too low.

573
00:41:21.378 --> 00:41:22.658
Too late. You had your chance.

574
00:41:29.218 --> 00:41:31.498
That's a kill. Knock it off.

575
00:41:32.618 --> 00:41:33.618
Damn it.

576
00:41:34.018 --> 00:41:35.618
Same old Rooster.

577
00:41:38.378 --> 00:41:40.258
Go see Hondo about your push-ups.

578
00:41:48.738 --> 00:41:49.858
All right, that's enough.

579
00:41:50.778 --> 00:41:52.338
Rooster. That's enough, man.

580
00:42:07.377 --> 00:42:09.777
Breaking the hard deck,
insubordination.

581
00:42:09.857 --> 00:42:10.937
Are you trying to get kicked out?

582
00:42:11.017 --> 00:42:12.057
Don't worry about it.

583
00:42:12.937 --> 00:42:15.497
Look, I'm going on this mission.

584
00:42:16.577 --> 00:42:19.337
But if you get kicked out,
you leave us flying with Hangman.

585
00:42:19.977 --> 00:42:21.737
Talk to me. What the hell was that?

586
00:42:21.817 --> 00:42:23.057
He pulled my papers.

587
00:42:23.777 --> 00:42:25.817
What? Who?

588
00:42:26.137 --> 00:42:27.137
Maverick.

589
00:42:28.337 --> 00:42:30.537
He pulled my application
to the Naval Academy.

590
00:42:32.017 --> 00:42:33.377
Set me back four years.

591
00:42:36.377 --> 00:42:37.697
Why would he do that?

592
00:42:43.697 --> 00:42:46.337
The hard deck is 5,000 feet
above ground level.

593
00:42:46.417 --> 00:42:48.697
A parameter is set not just
for the safety of our pilots

594
00:42:48.777 --> 00:42:50.297
but for the safety of their aircraft.

595
00:42:50.577 --> 00:42:52.417
5,000 feet is not just a rule.

596
00:42:52.497 --> 00:42:54.817
It is a law, as immutable as gravity.

597
00:42:54.897 --> 00:42:57.217
The hard deck will be much lower
for the mission, sir.

598
00:42:57.297 --> 00:43:00.137
And it will not change
without my approval.

599
00:43:00.657 --> 00:43:02.457
Especially not in the middle
of an exercise.

600
00:43:03.097 --> 00:43:04.857
And that Cobra maneuver of yours?

601
00:43:04.937 --> 00:43:06.417
That could've got
all three of you killed.

602
00:43:06.497 --> 00:43:08.057
I never want to see that shit again.

603
00:43:09.697 --> 00:43:11.817
What exactly do you suppose
you were teaching, Captain?

604
00:43:12.337 --> 00:43:14.377
That as good as they are, sir,
they still have something to learn.

605
00:43:14.457 --> 00:43:16.017
You are talking about
the best fighter pilots

606
00:43:16.097 --> 00:43:17.097
on the planet, Captain.

607
00:43:17.177 --> 00:43:18.977
And they've been told that
their entire career

608
00:43:19.057 --> 00:43:20.777
while they've been dropping bombs
from a high altitude

609
00:43:20.857 --> 00:43:22.417
with little to no dog fighting.

610
00:43:22.817 --> 00:43:23.937
The parameters of this mission

611
00:43:24.017 --> 00:43:25.337
call for something
they have never encountered.

612
00:43:25.417 --> 00:43:29.257
Okay, you have less than three weeks
to teach them how to fight as a team

613
00:43:30.177 --> 00:43:31.457
and how to strike the target.

614
00:43:31.537 --> 00:43:32.737
And how to come home.

615
00:43:36.217 --> 00:43:38.137
And how to come home, sir.

616
00:43:43.817 --> 00:43:45.177
Every mission has its risks.

617
00:43:46.417 --> 00:43:47.857
These pilots accept that.

618
00:43:48.617 --> 00:43:49.737
I don't, sir.

619
00:43:54.097 --> 00:43:55.337
Every morning, from this day forward

620
00:43:55.417 --> 00:43:57.177
you will brief us
on your instructional plans

621
00:43:57.257 --> 00:43:58.257
in writing.

622
00:43:58.337 --> 00:44:01.137
And nothing will change
without my express approval.

623
00:44:01.217 --> 00:44:04.457
- Including the hard deck, sir?
- Especially the hard deck, Captain.

624
00:44:06.817 --> 00:44:07.817
Sir.

625
00:44:08.737 --> 00:44:09.777
What is this?

626
00:44:09.857 --> 00:44:11.457
It's a request to lower
the hard deck, sir

627
00:44:11.537 --> 00:44:14.017
to practice a low-level bombing run
per the mission parameters.

628
00:44:20.097 --> 00:44:22.457
You could learn a thing or two
about timing, Captain.

629
00:44:23.497 --> 00:44:24.497
Yo, Coyote.

630
00:44:25.177 --> 00:44:26.217
Take a look at this.

631
00:44:30.937 --> 00:44:33.137
The man, the legend. There he is.

632
00:44:33.217 --> 00:44:34.697
No... Next to him.

633
00:44:36.657 --> 00:44:37.737
He look familiar to you?

634
00:44:40.057 --> 00:44:41.377
What have we here?

635
00:44:42.657 --> 00:44:43.857
"Bradshaw."

636
00:44:45.137 --> 00:44:46.537
As I live and breathe.

637
00:44:50.097 --> 00:44:52.697
Hey, Theo. You got big.

638
00:44:53.497 --> 00:44:54.497
Hey, Mav.

639
00:45:01.697 --> 00:45:02.697
Amelia?

640
00:45:03.017 --> 00:45:04.417
I know. I got big.

641
00:45:04.497 --> 00:45:05.577
Yes.

642
00:45:06.856 --> 00:45:08.016
Bar opens at 5.00.

643
00:45:08.896 --> 00:45:10.816
No, I just came by to pay off a debt.

644
00:45:10.896 --> 00:45:11.936
Mom!

645
00:45:16.856 --> 00:45:17.936
Hey, how's your dad?

646
00:45:18.216 --> 00:45:19.776
With his wife, in Hawaii.

647
00:45:20.056 --> 00:45:21.056
Mom!

648
00:45:22.616 --> 00:45:24.136
Mav says he owes you money.

649
00:45:25.976 --> 00:45:27.616
- Don't worry about it.
- I insist.

650
00:45:31.176 --> 00:45:32.256
Thank you, Captain.

651
00:45:33.096 --> 00:45:34.496
Consider your tab closed.

652
00:45:35.776 --> 00:45:37.496
Captain? Still?

653
00:45:38.416 --> 00:45:39.896
A highly decorated captain.

654
00:45:40.856 --> 00:45:42.936
Finish up.
We have to get the boat to the yard.

655
00:45:43.616 --> 00:45:45.656
- I can't go.
- What do you mean, you can't go?

656
00:45:45.736 --> 00:45:49.016
Test tomorrow. I have to study.
They only told us today.

657
00:45:49.296 --> 00:45:50.496
Well, I can't sail her alone.

658
00:45:51.176 --> 00:45:52.456
Just use the engine.

659
00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:54.576
Why are we taking her to the yard?

660
00:45:55.296 --> 00:45:56.776
- To fix the engine.
- To fix the engine.

661
00:45:57.656 --> 00:45:58.656
I can help.

662
00:46:04.776 --> 00:46:07.016
Little rougher than I was expecting.

663
00:46:07.096 --> 00:46:08.096
You don't say.

664
00:46:08.696 --> 00:46:11.576
Pull on the backstay.
We'll de-power the sails.

665
00:46:11.656 --> 00:46:12.656
Okay.

666
00:46:13.456 --> 00:46:14.456
What does that mean?

667
00:46:16.376 --> 00:46:18.056
You're supposed to be in the Navy.

668
00:46:18.656 --> 00:46:21.976
I don't sail boats, Penny.
I land on them.

669
00:46:22.696 --> 00:46:25.456
It's sort of like raising the flaps
on an airplane.

670
00:46:26.056 --> 00:46:27.296
So, how do I do that?

671
00:46:28.056 --> 00:46:30.416
You pull on that green line up there.

672
00:46:30.496 --> 00:46:31.496
Green line.

673
00:46:34.296 --> 00:46:35.896
Yep. Pull it hard.

674
00:46:36.096 --> 00:46:38.856
Yep. Crank that winch right there.

675
00:46:39.256 --> 00:46:40.336
Tighten the jib.

676
00:46:41.536 --> 00:46:43.336
- Crank it. You okay?
- Yeah.

677
00:46:45.376 --> 00:46:46.376
Good.

678
00:46:47.576 --> 00:46:48.576
Now...

679
00:46:50.056 --> 00:46:51.056
you ready?

680
00:46:53.296 --> 00:46:54.296
For what?

681
00:46:55.016 --> 00:46:56.256
The afterburner.

682
00:47:16.816 --> 00:47:17.976
Now you're in the Navy.

683
00:47:40.976 --> 00:47:42.176
Thanks for helping out today.

684
00:47:44.496 --> 00:47:45.896
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

685
00:47:51.456 --> 00:47:52.736
Don't give me that look.

686
00:47:53.256 --> 00:47:54.256
What look?

687
00:47:54.736 --> 00:47:55.736
That one.

688
00:47:59.256 --> 00:48:00.256
Good night, Pete.

689
00:48:01.376 --> 00:48:02.376
Night, Penny.

690
00:48:18.215 --> 00:48:19.615
Mom, is that you?

691
00:48:20.175 --> 00:48:21.335
Yeah, it's me.

692
00:48:22.495 --> 00:48:23.575
I'll make you dinner.

693
00:48:24.255 --> 00:48:25.255
Okay.

694
00:48:31.495 --> 00:48:33.495
Time is your greatest enemy.

695
00:48:35.375 --> 00:48:37.375
Phase one of the mission
will be a low-level ingress

696
00:48:37.455 --> 00:48:39.015
attacking in two-plane teams.

697
00:48:39.615 --> 00:48:41.855
You'll fly along this narrow canyon
to your target.

698
00:48:42.415 --> 00:48:45.095
Radar-guided surface-to-air missiles
defend the area.

699
00:48:45.655 --> 00:48:47.695
These SAMs, they're lethal.

700
00:48:48.735 --> 00:48:51.215
But they were designed
to protect the skies above

701
00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:52.455
not the canyon below.

702
00:48:52.535 --> 00:48:53.735
That's because the enemy knows

703
00:48:53.815 --> 00:48:56.215
no one is insane enough
to try and fly below them.

704
00:48:57.495 --> 00:48:59.255
That's exactly
what I'm gonna train you to do.

705
00:49:00.175 --> 00:49:04.095
On the day, your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum.

706
00:49:04.655 --> 00:49:07.375
You exceed this altitude,
radar will spot you...

707
00:49:08.575 --> 00:49:09.575
and you're dead.

708
00:49:11.255 --> 00:49:14.495
Your airspeed
will be 660 knots minimum.

709
00:49:15.415 --> 00:49:17.415
Time to target,
two and a half minutes.

710
00:49:18.175 --> 00:49:20.415
That's because
fifth-generation fighters wait

711
00:49:20.495 --> 00:49:21.735
at an air base nearby.

712
00:49:22.975 --> 00:49:26.815
In a head-to-head with these planes
in your F-18s, you're dead.

713
00:49:28.295 --> 00:49:31.135
That's why you need to get in,
hit your target, and be gone

714
00:49:31.215 --> 00:49:33.655
before these planes
even have a chance of catching you.

715
00:49:34.535 --> 00:49:37.095
This makes time
your greatest adversary.

716
00:49:39.175 --> 00:49:42.335
You'll fly a route in your nav system
that simulates the canyon.

717
00:49:43.055 --> 00:49:44.775
The faster you navigate this canyon

718
00:49:44.855 --> 00:49:47.695
the harder it'll be to stay
under the radar of these enemy SAMs.

719
00:49:48.575 --> 00:49:49.695
The tighter the turns

720
00:49:49.775 --> 00:49:52.855
the more intensely the force
of gravity on your body multiplies

721
00:49:53.495 --> 00:49:54.695
compressing your lungs

722
00:49:55.335 --> 00:49:57.095
forcing the blood from your brain

723
00:49:57.175 --> 00:49:59.495
impairing your judgment
and reaction time.

724
00:50:00.655 --> 00:50:02.495
So, for today's lesson,
we're gonna take it easy on you.

725
00:50:02.735 --> 00:50:05.455
Max ceiling, 300 feet.
Time to target, three minutes.

726
00:50:07.495 --> 00:50:08.495
Good luck.

727
00:50:17.415 --> 00:50:19.855
Time to target is 1 minute 30.
We are two seconds behind.

728
00:50:19.935 --> 00:50:21.495
Increase to 480 knots.

729
00:50:21.575 --> 00:50:22.735
We got to move, Coyote.

730
00:50:23.855 --> 00:50:25.095
Copy. Increasing speed.

731
00:50:27.295 --> 00:50:28.295
Oh, shit.

732
00:50:32.655 --> 00:50:34.975
- Why are they dead?
- We broke the 300-foot ceiling

733
00:50:35.055 --> 00:50:36.215
and a SAM took us out.

734
00:50:36.575 --> 00:50:38.175
No. Why are they dead?

735
00:50:38.255 --> 00:50:39.855
I slowed down
and didn't give her a warning.

736
00:50:39.935 --> 00:50:41.055
- It was my fault.
- Was there a reason

737
00:50:41.135 --> 00:50:42.135
you didn't communicate
with your team?

738
00:50:42.215 --> 00:50:43.735
- I was focusing on...
- One that their family

739
00:50:43.815 --> 00:50:45.015
will accept at the funeral.

740
00:50:46.815 --> 00:50:47.815
None, sir.

741
00:50:48.695 --> 00:50:50.055
Why didn't you anticipate the turn?

742
00:50:50.135 --> 00:50:51.295
You were briefed on the terrain.

743
00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:53.015
Don't tell me.

744
00:50:53.895 --> 00:50:54.895
Tell it to his family.

745
00:51:00.575 --> 00:51:02.855
Hangman, ease up.
The canyon's getting tighter.

746
00:51:02.935 --> 00:51:05.295
Negative, Payback.
Increase your speed.

747
00:51:07.135 --> 00:51:08.415
You're going too fast, man.

748
00:51:08.495 --> 00:51:10.455
Well, no harm
in being ahead of schedule.

749
00:51:12.775 --> 00:51:15.375
Damn it, slow down!
I can't stay on the course.

750
00:51:16.015 --> 00:51:18.135
You're gonna hit the wall! Watch out!

751
00:51:21.935 --> 00:51:24.295
- What happened?
- Well, I flew as fast as I could.

752
00:51:25.255 --> 00:51:26.615
Kind of like my ass depended on it.

753
00:51:26.935 --> 00:51:29.775
And you put your team in danger,
and your wingman's dead.

754
00:51:31.414 --> 00:51:32.494
They couldn't keep up.

755
00:51:38.774 --> 00:51:41.214
Rooster, we're 20 seconds behind
and dropping.

756
00:51:41.814 --> 00:51:43.774
We're fine. Speed is good.

757
00:51:44.494 --> 00:51:46.014
Increase to 500 knots.

758
00:51:46.094 --> 00:51:47.894
Negative, Yale. Hold your speed.

759
00:51:47.974 --> 00:51:49.934
- Rooster, we're late.
- We're alive.

760
00:51:50.014 --> 00:51:51.534
We'll make up time
in the straightaway.

761
00:51:52.414 --> 00:51:53.694
We are not gonna make it.

762
00:51:53.774 --> 00:51:55.614
Just trust me. Maintain your speed.

763
00:51:55.854 --> 00:51:56.854
We can make it.

764
00:51:57.254 --> 00:51:58.254
Why are you dead?

765
00:51:59.214 --> 00:52:00.374
You're team leader up there.

766
00:52:00.894 --> 00:52:03.254
Why are you... Why is your team dead?

767
00:52:03.334 --> 00:52:06.094
Sir, he's the only one
who made it to the target.

768
00:52:06.174 --> 00:52:07.174
A minute late.

769
00:52:08.174 --> 00:52:10.734
He gave enemy aircraft time
to shoot him down.

770
00:52:10.814 --> 00:52:12.294
- He is dead.
- You don't know that.

771
00:52:12.374 --> 00:52:16.214
You're not flying fast enough.
You don't have a second to waste.

772
00:52:16.294 --> 00:52:17.414
We made it to the target.

773
00:52:17.494 --> 00:52:21.574
And superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out.

774
00:52:21.654 --> 00:52:24.454
- Then it's a dogfight.
- Against fifth-generation fighters.

775
00:52:24.534 --> 00:52:25.974
Yeah. We'd still have a chance.

776
00:52:26.054 --> 00:52:27.094
In an F-18.

777
00:52:27.174 --> 00:52:29.654
It's not the plane, sir.
It's the pilot.

778
00:52:29.734 --> 00:52:30.734
Exactly.

779
00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:39.734
There's more than one way
to fly this mission.

780
00:52:40.734 --> 00:52:42.014
You really don't get it.

781
00:52:43.334 --> 00:52:46.054
On this mission,
a man flies like Maverick here

782
00:52:46.494 --> 00:52:48.014
or a man does not come back.

783
00:52:49.254 --> 00:52:50.534
No offense intended.

784
00:52:51.454 --> 00:52:53.654
Yet somehow you always manage.

785
00:52:55.294 --> 00:52:58.614
Look, I don't mean to criticize.
You're conservative, that's all.

786
00:52:58.694 --> 00:53:01.174
- Lieutenant.
- We're going into combat, son.

787
00:53:01.254 --> 00:53:03.574
On a level
no living pilot's ever seen.

788
00:53:05.254 --> 00:53:06.254
Not even him.

789
00:53:08.374 --> 00:53:10.054
That's no time to be thinking
about the past.

790
00:53:14.334 --> 00:53:16.334
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Rooster.

791
00:53:16.414 --> 00:53:18.774
I can't be the only one that knows
that Maverick flew with his old man.

792
00:53:18.854 --> 00:53:20.574
- Lieutenant, that's enough.
- Or that Maverick was flying

793
00:53:20.654 --> 00:53:22.214
- when his old man...
- Lieutenant, that's enough.

794
00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:26.214
- That's enough!
- You son of a bitch!

795
00:53:26.294 --> 00:53:27.294
Hey, come on!

796
00:53:27.614 --> 00:53:29.814
I'm cool, I'm cool. Hey...

797
00:53:30.054 --> 00:53:32.094
- That's enough.
- He's not cut out for this mission.

798
00:53:32.174 --> 00:53:33.814
- That's enough.
- You know it.

799
00:53:37.294 --> 00:53:38.294
You know I'm right.

800
00:53:44.654 --> 00:53:45.734
You're all dismissed.

801
00:54:50.093 --> 00:54:51.093
Maverick.

802
00:54:53.853 --> 00:54:54.893
It's come back?

803
00:54:56.133 --> 00:54:57.133
No one knows.

804
00:54:59.373 --> 00:55:00.893
There's nothing else they can do.

805
00:55:02.053 --> 00:55:04.933
Even speaking is painful now.

806
00:55:10.813 --> 00:55:12.173
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

807
00:55:32.893 --> 00:55:33.893
Admiral.

808
00:55:44.933 --> 00:55:45.973
How's my wingman?

809
00:55:57.693 --> 00:55:59.853
Please, don't worry about me.

810
00:56:01.453 --> 00:56:02.533
What can I do for you?

811
00:56:11.253 --> 00:56:12.253
All right.

812
00:56:15.293 --> 00:56:18.213
Well, Rooster's still angry with me
about what I did.

813
00:56:19.893 --> 00:56:22.333
I thought eventually
he would understand why.

814
00:56:24.733 --> 00:56:25.853
I hoped he'd forgive me.

815
00:56:35.053 --> 00:56:36.653
The mission is less than
three weeks away.

816
00:56:37.453 --> 00:56:38.533
The kid's not ready.

817
00:56:47.533 --> 00:56:48.773
He doesn't want what I have to give.

818
00:56:50.613 --> 00:56:51.733
Ice, please.

819
00:56:52.253 --> 00:56:54.173
Don't ask me
to send someone else to die.

820
00:56:54.253 --> 00:56:55.253
Please don't...

821
00:56:56.373 --> 00:56:57.693
Don't ask me to send him.

822
00:56:58.373 --> 00:56:59.373
Send me.

823
00:57:31.533 --> 00:57:32.613
I don't know how.

824
00:57:46.333 --> 00:57:47.493
I'm not a teacher, Ice.

825
00:57:50.453 --> 00:57:51.653
I'm a fighter pilot.

826
00:57:54.852 --> 00:57:56.012
A naval aviator.

827
00:57:58.932 --> 00:58:00.772
It's not what I am.

828
00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:03.212
It's who I am.

829
00:58:05.612 --> 00:58:06.692
How do I teach that?

830
00:58:09.212 --> 00:58:11.492
Even if I could teach it,
it's not what Rooster wants.

831
00:58:12.772 --> 00:58:13.972
It's not what the Navy wants.

832
00:58:15.052 --> 00:58:16.892
That's why they canned me
the last time.

833
00:58:20.252 --> 00:58:22.972
The only reason I'm here is you.

834
00:58:30.452 --> 00:58:31.852
If I send him on this mission...

835
00:58:33.852 --> 00:58:34.932
he might never come home.

836
00:58:39.412 --> 00:58:40.572
And if I don't send him...

837
00:58:41.772 --> 00:58:42.892
he'll never forgive me.

838
00:58:46.172 --> 00:58:48.612
Either way, I could lose him forever.

839
00:58:59.132 --> 00:59:00.132
I know.

840
00:59:00.932 --> 00:59:01.932
I know.

841
00:59:13.572 --> 00:59:16.732
The Navy needs Maverick.

842
00:59:19.172 --> 00:59:22.332
The kid needs Maverick.

843
00:59:23.692 --> 00:59:26.052
That's why I fought for you.

844
00:59:28.012 --> 00:59:30.012
That's why you're still here.

845
00:59:38.412 --> 00:59:39.532
Thank you, Ice...

846
00:59:40.772 --> 00:59:41.852
for everything.

847
00:59:47.212 --> 00:59:48.292
One last thing.

848
00:59:49.292 --> 00:59:50.572
Who's the better pilot?

849
00:59:51.252 --> 00:59:52.332
You or me?

850
00:59:55.572 --> 00:59:57.612
This is a nice moment.
Let's not ruin it.

851
01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:32.492
Let's go, let's go!
Huddle up, huddle up!

852
01:00:32.972 --> 01:00:33.972
Let's do it!

853
01:00:35.572 --> 01:00:36.812
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

854
01:00:38.532 --> 01:00:39.772
All right, all right.

855
01:00:50.492 --> 01:00:51.972
Touchdown!

856
01:00:52.572 --> 01:00:53.572
Yeah!

857
01:01:01.132 --> 01:01:02.292
Let's go...

858
01:01:04.372 --> 01:01:05.372
Oh, watch it!

859
01:01:06.691 --> 01:01:07.691
Come on!

860
01:02:01.891 --> 01:02:03.371
- Sir.
- What is this?

861
01:02:03.811 --> 01:02:05.011
This is dogfight football.

862
01:02:05.091 --> 01:02:07.251
Offense and defense at the same time.

863
01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:09.091
Who's winning?

864
01:02:09.411 --> 01:02:11.411
I think they stopped keeping score
a while ago.

865
01:02:12.211 --> 01:02:14.331
This detachment still has some
training to complete, Captain.

866
01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:17.451
- Every available minute matters.
- Yes, sir.

867
01:02:17.531 --> 01:02:18.811
So, why are we out here
playing games?

868
01:02:19.731 --> 01:02:21.491
You said to create a team, sir.

869
01:02:23.571 --> 01:02:24.571
There's your team.

870
01:02:27.651 --> 01:02:30.891
- Bob!
- Bob!

871
01:04:04.211 --> 01:04:06.811
Should I go? Before Amelia gets back?

872
01:04:06.891 --> 01:04:08.171
She'll be
at her friend's house tonight.

873
01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:09.251
Oh, good.

874
01:04:12.371 --> 01:04:13.891
You and Amelia, you seem...

875
01:04:16.651 --> 01:04:19.010
a lot closer than
when I last saw you.

876
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:20.250
Yeah.

877
01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:21.570
- Yeah, we are.
- How do you manage?

878
01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:24.850
Well...

879
01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:28.130
you know, she always
wanted more freedom

880
01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:29.570
than I thought she was ready for.

881
01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:32.370
Where'd she get that from, I wonder?

882
01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:37.410
I guess I realized...

883
01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:40.090
I also had to trust her.

884
01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:44.410
Let her make some
of her own mistakes sometimes.

885
01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:48.170
Not an easy choice.

886
01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:54.490
Is that what happened with Rooster?

887
01:04:58.850 --> 01:05:01.330
I pulled his papers
from the Naval Academy.

888
01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:06.010
Took years off his career.

889
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:13.530
Why?

890
01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:19.810
His mother never wanted him to fly,
not after what happened to Goose.

891
01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:25.290
She made me promise
before she died, so...

892
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:27.530
Does Rooster know that?

893
01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:34.290
He will always resent me
for what I did.

894
01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:38.370
Why should he resent her too?

895
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:44.890
Not an easy choice.

896
01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:50.810
I was trying to be
the father he lost.

897
01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:55.130
I just...

898
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:59.610
I wish I would've done it better.

899
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.290
The truth is...

900
01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:09.330
I didn't think he was ready.

901
01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:14.370
Is he ready now?

902
01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:19.730
Mom, I'm home.

903
01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:23.490
I thought you were staying
at Karen's tonight.

904
01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:26.450
Karen's sick,
and I've got homework to do.

905
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:28.690
- I should go.
- You should go.

906
01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:31.130
Have you had dinner yet?

907
01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:32.650
Not yet. You want to go out?

908
01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:35.210
No, it's okay.
I'll make you something.

909
01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:36.970
I'll be down in a sec.

910
01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:39.770
- Oh, wait. Not that way.
- What?

911
01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:43.770
Look, I have an example to set.

912
01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:45.730
I can't be bringing guys home
on a first date.

913
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:47.610
This is not our first date.

914
01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:49.810
You know what I mean.

915
01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:54.530
Okay.

916
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:56.370
Fine.

917
01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:59.410
But this is the last time
I go out your window.

918
01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:01.010
We'll see.

919
01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:02.570
No. No, I mean it.

920
01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:04.690
I'm never gonna leave you again.

921
01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:08.330
Oh, shut up.

922
01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:10.250
Go on, get out of here.

923
01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:25.810
Just don't break her heart again.

924
01:07:38.409 --> 01:07:39.409
Good morning.

925
01:07:39.649 --> 01:07:41.689
The uranium enrichment plant
that is your target

926
01:07:41.769 --> 01:07:43.849
will be operational
earlier than expected.

927
01:07:44.289 --> 01:07:47.289
Raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days' time.

928
01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:50.889
As a result, your mission
has been moved up one week

929
01:07:51.489 --> 01:07:54.369
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation.

930
01:07:54.929 --> 01:07:56.849
Sir, no one here
has successfully flown

931
01:07:56.929 --> 01:07:57.929
a low-level course.

932
01:07:58.009 --> 01:07:59.809
Nevertheless,
you've been ordered to move on.

933
01:08:01.169 --> 01:08:02.169
Captain.

934
01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:07.449
We have one week left
to focus on phase two.

935
01:08:07.529 --> 01:08:09.409
It's the most difficult stage
of the mission.

936
01:08:09.489 --> 01:08:11.089
It's a pop-up strike
with a steep dive

937
01:08:11.169 --> 01:08:14.169
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles.

938
01:08:15.449 --> 01:08:18.369
Two pairs of F-18s will fly
in a welded wing formation.

939
01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:19.929
Teamwork.

940
01:08:20.009 --> 01:08:22.529
Precise coordination
of these aircraft is essential

941
01:08:22.609 --> 01:08:25.089
to both the mission's success
and your survival.

942
01:08:25.489 --> 01:08:28.169
As you know, the plant rests
between two mountains.

943
01:08:28.529 --> 01:08:32.249
On final approach, you'll invert
directly into a steep dive.

944
01:08:32.969 --> 01:08:35.969
This allows you to maintain
the lowest possible altitude

945
01:08:37.209 --> 01:08:39.049
and the only possible attack angle.

946
01:08:42.529 --> 01:08:46.249
Your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide.

947
01:08:47.889 --> 01:08:49.529
The two-seat aircraft
will paint the target

948
01:08:49.609 --> 01:08:50.809
with a laser bull's-eye.

949
01:08:52.289 --> 01:08:53.689
The first pair
will breach the reactor

950
01:08:53.769 --> 01:08:57.249
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

951
01:08:57.849 --> 01:09:00.049
This will create an opening
for the second pair.

952
01:09:01.049 --> 01:09:02.409
That's miracle number one.

953
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:07.289
The second team
will deliver the kill shot...

954
01:09:09.169 --> 01:09:10.409
and destroy the target.

955
01:09:11.969 --> 01:09:13.249
That's miracle number two.

956
01:09:14.889 --> 01:09:16.849
If either team misses the target...

957
01:09:19.289 --> 01:09:21.169
- That's a miss.
<i>- ...the mission is a failure.</i>

958
01:09:21.249 --> 01:09:22.249
Damn it.

959
01:09:22.929 --> 01:09:26.689
Egress is a steep high-G climb out
to avoid hitting this mountain.

960
01:09:29.769 --> 01:09:32.849
A steep climb at that speed,
you're pulling at least eight G's.

961
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:34.329
Nine, minimum.

962
01:09:34.409 --> 01:09:37.289
The stress limit
of the F-18's airframe is 7.5.

963
01:09:37.369 --> 01:09:38.809
That's the accepted limit.

964
01:09:38.889 --> 01:09:41.089
To survive this mission,
you'll pull beyond that

965
01:09:41.169 --> 01:09:43.249
even if it means
bending your airframe.

966
01:09:45.169 --> 01:09:48.329
You'll be pulling so hard,
you'll weigh close to 2,000 pounds

967
01:09:48.849 --> 01:09:51.089
your skull crushing your spine

968
01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:52.329
your lungs imploding

969
01:09:52.409 --> 01:09:54.129
like an elephant's
sitting on your chest

970
01:09:54.969 --> 01:09:57.769
fighting with everything you have
just to keep from blacking out.

971
01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:02.609
And this is where you'll be
at your most vulnerable.

972
01:10:03.729 --> 01:10:06.329
This... is Coffin Corner.

973
01:10:07.049 --> 01:10:09.369
Assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain

974
01:10:09.449 --> 01:10:11.329
you'll climb straight up
into enemy radar

975
01:10:11.409 --> 01:10:12.929
while losing all of your airspeed.

976
01:10:13.529 --> 01:10:16.009
Within seconds,
you'll be fired upon by enemy SAMs.

977
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:19.569
You've all faced sustained G's before

978
01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:20.649
but this...

979
01:10:20.729 --> 01:10:22.729
This is gonna take you
and your aircraft

980
01:10:22.809 --> 01:10:23.809
to the breaking point.

981
01:10:24.569 --> 01:10:26.969
Sir, is this even achievable?

982
01:10:27.249 --> 01:10:28.449
The answer to that question

983
01:10:29.569 --> 01:10:31.329
will come down
to the pilot in the box.

984
01:10:41.609 --> 01:10:43.768
- Talk to me, Bob.
- We are 12 seconds late on target.

985
01:10:43.848 --> 01:10:45.048
- We gotta move, we gotta move.
- Shit.

986
01:10:45.128 --> 01:10:46.568
Copy. Try to stay with me.

987
01:10:50.808 --> 01:10:51.848
Wait, who's that?

988
01:10:53.128 --> 01:10:54.448
<i>Blue Team, you've been spotted.</i>

989
01:10:54.848 --> 01:10:57.208
- Shit, it's Maverick.
- What the hell is he doing here?

990
01:10:57.288 --> 01:11:00.408
I'm a bandit on course to intercept.
Blue Team, what are you gonna do?

991
01:11:00.488 --> 01:11:03.488
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock.
700 knots closure.

992
01:11:03.568 --> 01:11:04.888
Your call. What do you want to do?

993
01:11:05.648 --> 01:11:08.448
Continue. We're close.
Stay on target.

994
01:11:08.728 --> 01:11:11.728
- He's swinging around to the north.
- Stand by for pop-up.

995
01:11:11.808 --> 01:11:13.968
- Be ready on that laser, Bob.
- Copy. I'm on it.

996
01:11:15.808 --> 01:11:17.848
Blue Team, bandit is still closing.

997
01:11:17.928 --> 01:11:18.928
Popping now.

998
01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:27.408
Talk to me, Bob. Where's Maverick?

999
01:11:27.488 --> 01:11:29.248
He's five miles out.
He's coming fast.

1000
01:11:35.528 --> 01:11:37.888
- Target's in sight.
- Where's my laser, Bob?

1001
01:11:38.808 --> 01:11:39.888
Deadeye, deadeye.

1002
01:11:39.968 --> 01:11:41.968
It's no good.
Sorry, I can't get a lock.

1003
01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:43.688
We're out of time.
I'm dropping blind.

1004
01:11:47.328 --> 01:11:48.328
Damn it, missed.

1005
01:12:00.288 --> 01:12:02.488
- That's tone.
- Maverick's got missile lock on us.

1006
01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:03.608
Shit. We're dead.

1007
01:12:04.408 --> 01:12:07.208
Blue Team, that's a fail.
Level out, Coyote.

1008
01:12:09.928 --> 01:12:10.928
<i>Coyote? Do you copy?</i>

1009
01:12:14.528 --> 01:12:15.808
<i>Coyote, come in.</i>

1010
01:12:16.848 --> 01:12:18.528
<i>Coyote, level wings.</i>

1011
01:12:18.928 --> 01:12:20.288
Oh, my god. He's in G-LOC.

1012
01:12:21.088 --> 01:12:23.128
<i>Coyote? Coyote?</i>

1013
01:12:23.688 --> 01:12:25.688
- He's gonna burn in.
- I'm going after him.

1014
01:12:29.568 --> 01:12:31.728
Come on. Give me tone...

1015
01:12:32.288 --> 01:12:34.288
Snap out of it, Coyote.
Come on. Come on.

1016
01:12:37.928 --> 01:12:40.008
Come on, Coyote, come on. Come on!

1017
01:12:40.848 --> 01:12:43.368
<i>- Damn it! Coyote! Coyote!
- Pull up. Pull up.</i>

1018
01:12:43.448 --> 01:12:45.968
<i>- Coyote! Coyote!
- Pull up. Pull up.</i>

1019
01:12:50.808 --> 01:12:52.608
Coyote, you okay? You okay?

1020
01:12:53.728 --> 01:12:55.408
I'm okay. I'm good.

1021
01:12:56.368 --> 01:12:59.248
Good, good. That's enough for today.

1022
01:13:01.528 --> 01:13:02.528
That was close.

1023
01:13:03.448 --> 01:13:04.448
Too close.

1024
01:13:05.088 --> 01:13:06.208
Bird strike. Bird strike!

1025
01:13:07.288 --> 01:13:08.288
Bird strike!

1026
01:13:12.128 --> 01:13:14.368
- Phoenix, left engine's on fire.
- Climbing.

1027
01:13:16.528 --> 01:13:19.128
Throttling back.
Shutting off fuel to left engine.

1028
01:13:19.208 --> 01:13:20.208
Extinguishing fire.

1029
01:13:23.048 --> 01:13:24.888
- Right engine is out.
- It's still spinning.

1030
01:13:24.968 --> 01:13:25.968
Trying to restart it.

1031
01:13:27.968 --> 01:13:29.088
Phoenix, it's on fire.

1032
01:13:29.168 --> 01:13:30.328
- Don't start it.
- Throttling up.

1033
01:13:32.488 --> 01:13:33.488
Oh, my god.

1034
01:13:37.128 --> 01:13:39.608
- We're on fire! We're on fire!
- Damn it!

1035
01:13:39.688 --> 01:13:42.288
<i>- Engine fire. Right.</i>
- Extinguishing right engine.

1036
01:13:45.488 --> 01:13:47.608
Phoenix, Bob, punch out, punch out!

1037
01:13:47.768 --> 01:13:49.768
Warning lights everywhere!
Hydraulic failure!

1038
01:13:49.848 --> 01:13:51.688
<i>- Flight controls.</i>
- I can't control it.

1039
01:13:51.768 --> 01:13:54.208
We're going down, Phoenix!
We're going in! We're going in!

1040
01:13:54.687 --> 01:13:57.207
You can't save it! Eject, eject!

1041
01:13:57.287 --> 01:13:58.527
Eject!

1042
01:13:58.607 --> 01:14:00.687
<i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

1043
01:14:22.887 --> 01:14:24.767
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob
in the hospital overnight

1044
01:14:24.847 --> 01:14:25.847
for observation.

1045
01:14:25.927 --> 01:14:27.007
They're gonna be okay.

1046
01:14:31.527 --> 01:14:32.527
That's good.

1047
01:14:36.167 --> 01:14:37.487
I've never lost a wingman.

1048
01:14:38.767 --> 01:14:39.807
You're lucky.

1049
01:14:40.487 --> 01:14:41.887
Fly long enough, it'll happen.

1050
01:14:45.127 --> 01:14:46.127
There will be others.

1051
01:14:49.447 --> 01:14:50.767
Easy for you to say.

1052
01:14:50.847 --> 01:14:51.847
No wife.

1053
01:14:53.487 --> 01:14:54.487
No kids.

1054
01:14:55.567 --> 01:14:57.487
Nobody to mourn you when you burn in.

1055
01:15:01.407 --> 01:15:02.407
Go home.

1056
01:15:03.727 --> 01:15:04.807
Just get some sleep.

1057
01:15:07.687 --> 01:15:09.607
Why'd you pull my papers
at the Academy?

1058
01:15:10.327 --> 01:15:11.727
Why did you stand in my way?

1059
01:15:14.287 --> 01:15:15.287
You weren't ready.

1060
01:15:15.727 --> 01:15:16.727
Ready for what?

1061
01:15:18.767 --> 01:15:20.647
- Ready to fly like you?
- No.

1062
01:15:20.727 --> 01:15:21.887
Ready to forget the book.

1063
01:15:21.967 --> 01:15:24.847
Trust your instincts.
Don't think, just do.

1064
01:15:25.327 --> 01:15:27.527
You think up there, you're dead.
Believe me.

1065
01:15:29.047 --> 01:15:30.247
My dad believed in you.

1066
01:15:33.527 --> 01:15:35.047
I'm not gonna make the same mistake.

1067
01:15:41.527 --> 01:15:42.527
Maverick.

1068
01:15:53.407 --> 01:15:56.047
Ready, aim, fire.

1069
01:16:01.447 --> 01:16:02.447
Ready...

1070
01:16:02.967 --> 01:16:04.887
aim, fire.

1071
01:16:15.967 --> 01:16:17.007
Ready...

1072
01:16:17.887 --> 01:16:19.887
aim, fire.

1073
01:16:54.687 --> 01:16:56.847
I can only imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

1074
01:16:58.007 --> 01:17:00.207
Take some time. Whatever you need.

1075
01:17:01.687 --> 01:17:03.847
I appreciate that, sir.
But there is no time. The mission...

1076
01:17:03.927 --> 01:17:05.367
I'll be taking over the training
from here.

1077
01:17:06.886 --> 01:17:07.886
Sir?

1078
01:17:09.406 --> 01:17:10.846
We both know
you didn't want this job, Captain.

1079
01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:11.926
Sir, they're not ready.

1080
01:17:12.006 --> 01:17:13.566
Well, it was your job
to get them ready.

1081
01:17:13.646 --> 01:17:16.766
Sir, they have to believe
that this mission can be flown.

1082
01:17:16.846 --> 01:17:18.886
And all you've managed to do
is teach them that it can't.

1083
01:17:20.726 --> 01:17:22.286
- Sir...
- You're grounded, Captain.

1084
01:17:23.406 --> 01:17:24.406
Permanently.

1085
01:17:28.646 --> 01:17:29.846
- Sir...
- That is all.

1086
01:17:48.406 --> 01:17:49.406
I heard.

1087
01:17:51.806 --> 01:17:52.886
I'm sorry.

1088
01:17:53.726 --> 01:17:54.886
What are you gonna do?

1089
01:17:56.606 --> 01:17:57.686
Ice is gone.

1090
01:18:00.406 --> 01:18:01.686
What choice do I have?

1091
01:18:03.366 --> 01:18:05.326
You'll have to find a way back
on your own.

1092
01:18:05.926 --> 01:18:06.926
No, Penny.

1093
01:18:09.126 --> 01:18:10.126
I'm out.

1094
01:18:12.166 --> 01:18:13.166
This is over.

1095
01:18:13.966 --> 01:18:14.966
Pete.

1096
01:18:15.206 --> 01:18:17.046
If you lost your wingman up there...

1097
01:18:18.246 --> 01:18:19.326
you'd keep fighting.

1098
01:18:20.086 --> 01:18:21.326
You wouldn't just give up.

1099
01:18:22.126 --> 01:18:23.606
Those are your pilots.

1100
01:18:25.286 --> 01:18:27.046
If anything happens to them...

1101
01:18:28.246 --> 01:18:30.006
you'll never forgive yourself.

1102
01:18:34.446 --> 01:18:35.526
I don't know what to do.

1103
01:18:40.446 --> 01:18:41.686
But you'll find a way.

1104
01:18:44.326 --> 01:18:45.326
I know you will.

1105
01:18:47.606 --> 01:18:49.886
Captain Mitchell
is no longer your instructor.

1106
01:18:50.246 --> 01:18:52.406
And as of today,
there are new mission parameters.

1107
01:18:53.326 --> 01:18:55.126
Time to target is now four minutes.

1108
01:18:56.206 --> 01:18:58.606
You'll be entering the valley level
at reduced speed.

1109
01:18:58.686 --> 01:19:00.766
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1110
01:19:01.566 --> 01:19:04.366
Sir, won't we be giving their planes
time to intercept?

1111
01:19:04.446 --> 01:19:05.846
Well, Lieutenant,
you have a fighting chance

1112
01:19:05.926 --> 01:19:07.046
against enemy aircraft.

1113
01:19:07.446 --> 01:19:09.526
What are the odds of surviving
a head-on collision with a mountain?

1114
01:19:10.446 --> 01:19:13.086
You'll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude.

1115
01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:14.366
Level with the north wall.

1116
01:19:14.566 --> 01:19:16.286
Gonna be a little harder
to keep your laser on target

1117
01:19:16.366 --> 01:19:18.766
but you will avoid
the high-G climb out.

1118
01:19:18.846 --> 01:19:20.726
We'll be sitting ducks
for enemy missiles.

1119
01:19:26.286 --> 01:19:27.286
Who the hell is that?

1120
01:19:29.446 --> 01:19:32.766
<i>Maverick to Range Control.
Entering Point Alpha.</i>

1121
01:19:32.846 --> 01:19:34.406
Confirm green range.

1122
01:19:34.886 --> 01:19:36.326
<i>Maverick, Range Control.</i>

1123
01:19:37.286 --> 01:19:38.806
<i>Green range is confirmed.</i>

1124
01:19:38.886 --> 01:19:41.766
<i>I don't see an event
scheduled for you, sir.</i>

1125
01:19:41.846 --> 01:19:43.446
<i>Well, I'm going anyway.</i>

1126
01:19:44.006 --> 01:19:45.006
Nice.

1127
01:19:46.166 --> 01:19:48.966
<i>Setting time to target,
two minutes fifteen seconds.</i>

1128
01:19:49.286 --> 01:19:50.766
2:15? That's impossible.

1129
01:19:51.206 --> 01:19:53.366
Final attack point.
Maverick's inbound.

1130
01:21:31.445 --> 01:21:34.085
Popping in three, two, one.

1131
01:22:01.045 --> 01:22:02.045
Bombs away.

1132
01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.205
Bull's-eye! Holy shit.

1133
01:22:22.965 --> 01:22:23.965
Yes.

1134
01:22:27.645 --> 01:22:28.645
Damn.

1135
01:22:41.285 --> 01:22:43.605
You have put me
in a difficult position, Captain.

1136
01:22:44.565 --> 01:22:46.445
On the one hand,
you have demonstrated

1137
01:22:46.525 --> 01:22:48.005
that this mission can be flown.

1138
01:22:48.645 --> 01:22:50.205
Perhaps the only way
it can be survived.

1139
01:22:51.805 --> 01:22:52.965
On the other hand...

1140
01:22:53.685 --> 01:22:54.685
you did it by stealing

1141
01:22:54.765 --> 01:22:56.605
a multimillion-dollar
military aircraft

1142
01:22:56.685 --> 01:22:59.485
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again.

1143
01:23:00.925 --> 01:23:03.005
Iceman is no longer here
to protect you.

1144
01:23:04.045 --> 01:23:06.645
I have everything I need
to have you court-martialed

1145
01:23:06.725 --> 01:23:08.205
and dishonorably discharged.

1146
01:23:09.365 --> 01:23:10.365
So, what do I do?

1147
01:23:11.645 --> 01:23:12.925
Risk the lives of my pilots

1148
01:23:13.005 --> 01:23:14.765
and perhaps the success
of this mission...

1149
01:23:16.165 --> 01:23:17.165
or...

1150
01:23:18.765 --> 01:23:19.925
risk my career

1151
01:23:21.485 --> 01:23:22.965
by appointing you team leader?

1152
01:23:27.045 --> 01:23:28.685
- Sir...
- I think the admiral's asking

1153
01:23:28.765 --> 01:23:30.644
a rhetorical question, Captain.

1154
01:25:12.124 --> 01:25:13.124
Talk to me, Goose.

1155
01:25:17.004 --> 01:25:18.084
Captain Mitchell.

1156
01:25:25.484 --> 01:25:26.804
You're where you belong.

1157
01:25:32.004 --> 01:25:33.084
Make us proud.

1158
01:25:59.804 --> 01:26:01.204
It has been an honor flying with you.

1159
01:26:02.804 --> 01:26:05.724
Each one of you represents
the best of the best.

1160
01:26:07.324 --> 01:26:09.124
This is a very specific mission.

1161
01:26:10.964 --> 01:26:13.604
My choice is a reflection of that
and nothing more.

1162
01:26:14.244 --> 01:26:15.604
Choose your two Foxtrot teams.

1163
01:26:17.484 --> 01:26:18.724
Payback and Fanboy.

1164
01:26:20.164 --> 01:26:21.164
Phoenix and Bob.

1165
01:26:25.604 --> 01:26:26.604
And your wingman.

1166
01:26:31.964 --> 01:26:32.964
Rooster.

1167
01:26:37.604 --> 01:26:39.804
The rest of you will stand by
on the carrier

1168
01:26:39.884 --> 01:26:42.364
for any reserve role that's required.

1169
01:26:43.563 --> 01:26:44.563
Dismissed.

1170
01:26:52.443 --> 01:26:55.083
Your target is a clear
and present threat.

1171
01:26:56.843 --> 01:27:00.163
A secret uranium enrichment site
under rogue state control.

1172
01:27:01.523 --> 01:27:04.643
It's an underground bunker,
tucked between these two mountains.

1173
01:27:06.443 --> 01:27:07.803
Your route of ingress

1174
01:27:07.883 --> 01:27:09.923
is heavily defended
by surface-to-air missiles

1175
01:27:10.003 --> 01:27:12.523
backed up
by fifth-generation fighters.

1176
01:27:12.603 --> 01:27:14.923
Once your F-18 strike team
crosses the border

1177
01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:17.443
Tomahawk missiles
from the USS <i>Leyte Gulf</i>

1178
01:27:17.523 --> 01:27:20.923
will launch a synchronized strike
on the enemy's airfield here.

1179
01:27:22.323 --> 01:27:24.483
This will knock out their runway.

1180
01:27:25.963 --> 01:27:28.803
But you'll have to contend
with any planes already in the air.

1181
01:27:30.003 --> 01:27:32.643
The moment those Tomahawks hit,
the enemy will know you're coming.

1182
01:27:34.003 --> 01:27:38.003
Your time to target
will be 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

1183
01:27:39.483 --> 01:27:41.683
Any longer than that,
and you will be exposed

1184
01:27:41.763 --> 01:27:43.763
to any aircraft
the Tomahawks may have missed.

1185
01:27:47.723 --> 01:27:49.283
This is what
you've all been training for.

1186
01:27:52.163 --> 01:27:53.163
Come home safely.

1187
01:28:08.243 --> 01:28:09.323
You give them hell.

1188
01:28:22.523 --> 01:28:23.523
Sir.

1189
01:28:24.083 --> 01:28:25.083
Sir?

1190
01:28:27.563 --> 01:28:28.563
I...

1191
01:28:31.283 --> 01:28:32.283
I just want to say...

1192
01:28:42.123 --> 01:28:43.123
We'll talk...

1193
01:28:44.763 --> 01:28:45.843
when we get back.

1194
01:28:52.843 --> 01:28:54.203
Hey, Bradley. Bradley.

1195
01:28:55.123 --> 01:28:56.123
Hey.

1196
01:28:59.843 --> 01:29:00.843
You got this.

1197
01:29:09.483 --> 01:29:10.483
Maverick.

1198
01:29:13.123 --> 01:29:14.123
Maverick?

1199
01:29:15.723 --> 01:29:17.203
Hey, you with me?

1200
01:29:19.203 --> 01:29:20.403
I don't like that look, Mav.

1201
01:29:23.843 --> 01:29:25.043
It's the only one I got.

1202
01:29:30.083 --> 01:29:31.083
Thank you.

1203
01:29:32.723 --> 01:29:34.123
If I don't see you again, Hondo...

1204
01:29:35.083 --> 01:29:36.083
thank you.

1205
01:29:44.083 --> 01:29:45.283
It's been an honor, Captain.

1206
01:30:19.322 --> 01:30:21.642
Dagger One, up and ready
on Catapult One.

1207
01:30:22.202 --> 01:30:23.762
Dagger Spare standing by.

1208
01:30:24.322 --> 01:30:26.162
Dagger Four, up and ready.

1209
01:30:26.242 --> 01:30:27.802
Dagger Three, up and ready.

1210
01:30:27.882 --> 01:30:30.042
Dagger Two, up and ready.

1211
01:30:31.122 --> 01:30:33.562
Support assets airborne.
Strike package ready.

1212
01:30:34.042 --> 01:30:35.522
Standing by for launch decision.

1213
01:30:36.482 --> 01:30:37.482
Send them.

1214
01:30:57.962 --> 01:30:59.202
Dagger Two away.

1215
01:31:00.402 --> 01:31:01.682
Dagger Three away.

1216
01:31:02.882 --> 01:31:04.002
Dagger Four away.

1217
01:31:15.282 --> 01:31:17.762
Comanche, Dagger One.
Standby check in.

1218
01:31:19.242 --> 01:31:20.642
<i>Comanche 11, set.</i>

1219
01:31:20.722 --> 01:31:22.922
Picture clean.
Recommend Dagger continue.

1220
01:31:23.002 --> 01:31:25.002
Copy. Daggers descending below radar.

1221
01:31:44.762 --> 01:31:47.562
Daggers now below radar.
Switching to E-2 picture.

1222
01:31:56.122 --> 01:31:58.522
Here we go. Enemy territory up ahead.

1223
01:31:58.602 --> 01:32:01.602
Feet dry in 60 seconds.
Comanche, Dagger One. Picture.

1224
01:32:01.682 --> 01:32:04.562
Comanche. Picture clean.
Decision is yours.

1225
01:32:05.042 --> 01:32:06.042
Copy.

1226
01:32:14.202 --> 01:32:15.362
Dagger attack.

1227
01:32:20.722 --> 01:32:22.002
Tomahawks airborne.

1228
01:32:22.082 --> 01:32:23.682
No turning back now.

1229
01:32:29.922 --> 01:32:31.922
Daggers, assume attack formation.

1230
01:32:40.842 --> 01:32:42.642
<i>Daggers set. Proceeding to target.</i>

1231
01:32:43.042 --> 01:32:46.922
Two minutes and 30 seconds
in three, two, one, mark.

1232
01:32:47.722 --> 01:32:49.002
- Two mark.
- Three mark.

1233
01:32:49.082 --> 01:32:50.082
Four mark.

1234
01:32:55.162 --> 01:32:56.162
Going in.

1235
01:33:11.841 --> 01:33:13.081
First SAM site overhead.

1236
01:33:18.161 --> 01:33:19.641
Looks like we're clear on radar, Mav.

1237
01:33:20.041 --> 01:33:21.441
Let's not take it for granted.

1238
01:33:25.001 --> 01:33:26.641
More SAMs. Three o'clock high.

1239
01:33:29.521 --> 01:33:31.801
- We got two minutes to target.
<i>- Copy.</i>

1240
01:33:31.881 --> 01:33:33.881
We're a few seconds behind, Rooster.
We gotta move.

1241
01:33:35.841 --> 01:33:38.401
Thirty seconds to Tomahawk impact
on enemy airstrip.

1242
01:33:47.041 --> 01:33:49.041
Dagger, Comanche.
We're picking up two bandits.

1243
01:33:49.121 --> 01:33:50.441
<i>Single group, two contacts.</i>

1244
01:33:50.521 --> 01:33:51.601
Where the hell'd they come from?

1245
01:33:52.081 --> 01:33:53.201
Long-range patrol?

1246
01:33:58.241 --> 01:33:59.481
Comanche, what's their heading?

1247
01:33:59.561 --> 01:34:02.201
<i>Bull's-eye 090, 50, tacked southwest.</i>

1248
01:34:02.281 --> 01:34:04.241
They're headed away from us.
They don't know we're here.

1249
01:34:04.521 --> 01:34:06.641
The second those Tomahawks
hit the air base

1250
01:34:06.721 --> 01:34:08.681
those bandits are gonna move
to defend the target.

1251
01:34:08.761 --> 01:34:11.401
We have to get there before they do.
Increase speed.

1252
01:34:12.801 --> 01:34:14.441
We got you, Mav. Don't wait for me.

1253
01:34:21.081 --> 01:34:24.041
Sir, Daggers Two and Four
are behind schedule.

1254
01:34:24.121 --> 01:34:25.761
Time to target, 1 minute 20.

1255
01:34:27.201 --> 01:34:29.441
Tomahawk impact in three, two...

1256
01:34:33.761 --> 01:34:36.321
Impact. Enemy runway is destroyed.

1257
01:34:37.241 --> 01:34:38.321
They know we're coming now.

1258
01:34:42.281 --> 01:34:44.521
Bandits are switching course
to defend the target.

1259
01:34:44.601 --> 01:34:45.721
Rooster, where are you?

1260
01:34:47.481 --> 01:34:48.481
<i>Come on, Rooster.</i>

1261
01:34:48.561 --> 01:34:50.401
Bandits inbound.
We got to make up time now.

1262
01:34:50.481 --> 01:34:51.481
Let's turn and burn.

1263
01:34:59.441 --> 01:35:00.441
Heads up, Phoenix.

1264
01:35:10.561 --> 01:35:12.921
Sir, bandits
are two minutes from target.

1265
01:35:13.001 --> 01:35:14.521
Daggers are one minute from target.

1266
01:35:14.601 --> 01:35:16.721
Come on, Rooster. Move it or lose it.

1267
01:35:19.321 --> 01:35:22.081
Guys, we're falling behind.
We really gotta move.

1268
01:35:22.161 --> 01:35:23.801
If we don't increase
our speed right now

1269
01:35:23.881 --> 01:35:25.241
those bandits
are gonna be waiting for us

1270
01:35:25.321 --> 01:35:26.521
when we reach the target.

1271
01:35:28.561 --> 01:35:29.561
Talk to me, Dad.

1272
01:35:31.241 --> 01:35:32.601
Come on, kid, you can do it.

1273
01:35:32.681 --> 01:35:34.601
Don't think, just do.

1274
01:35:43.321 --> 01:35:44.801
Jesus, Rooster, not that fast.

1275
01:35:44.881 --> 01:35:47.401
That's it, kid, that's it.
All right, let's go.

1276
01:35:51.521 --> 01:35:53.241
Damn, Rooster, take it easy.

1277
01:35:53.841 --> 01:35:55.921
Sir, Dagger Two is re-engaging.

1278
01:35:56.921 --> 01:35:58.641
All right, now hit your target
and come home.

1279
01:36:03.681 --> 01:36:05.801
Thirty seconds to target.
Bob, check your laser.

1280
01:36:06.201 --> 01:36:09.761
Air-to-ground check complete.
Laser code verified, 1688.

1281
01:36:09.841 --> 01:36:10.841
<i>Laser is a go.</i>

1282
01:36:13.241 --> 01:36:14.241
Watch your heads.

1283
01:36:16.361 --> 01:36:17.801
Holy shit! Shit!

1284
01:36:17.881 --> 01:36:19.760
- Payback, you with me?
- Right behind you.

1285
01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.720
Phoenix, stand by for pop-up strike.

1286
01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.200
Dagger Three in position.

1287
01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.480
Popping in three, two, one.

1288
01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:57.760
- Get me eyes on that target, Bob.
- Dagger Three.

1289
01:36:58.920 --> 01:36:59.920
<i>Stand by, Mav.</i>

1290
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.080
- Come on, Bob, come on.
- Stand by.

1291
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.720
- I've got it. Captured!
- Target acquired. Bombs away.

1292
01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:30.080
We've got impact!
Check, direct hit! Direct hit!

1293
01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:31.920
That's miracle number one.

1294
01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.240
Dagger Two, status.

1295
01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.800
Almost there, Mav. Almost there.

1296
01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.080
Fanboy, where's my laser?

1297
01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:42.480
Rooster, there's something wrong
with this laser!

1298
01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.480
Shit. Deadeye!

1299
01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.040
Come on, guys.
We're running out of time.

1300
01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:47.640
<i>- Get it online.
- I'm trying.</i>

1301
01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.680
<i>- Come on, Fanboy.</i>
- Nearly there. Nearly there.

1302
01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.320
Come on, Fanboy, get it online.

1303
01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:01.640
There's no time. I'm dropping blind.

1304
01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:03.760
- Rooster, I got this! I got this!
- No time. Pull up.

1305
01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.400
- Wait.
- Bombs away! Bombs away!

1306
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.600
Bull's-eye!

1307
01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.080
Miracle number two.

1308
01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.760
Now they're in Coffin Corner.

1309
01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:29.920
We're not out of this yet.

1310
01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:32.760
Here it comes.

1311
01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:38.400
Radar warning. Smoke in the air.
Phoenix, break right.

1312
01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:40.480
Emergency jettison.
Dagger Three defending.

1313
01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:41.880
Here comes another one!

1314
01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:43.840
Dagger One defending.

1315
01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:51.800
Rooster, status.

1316
01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.040
Oh, my god.

1317
01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:04.600
Smoke in the air! Smoke in the air!

1318
01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.040
Break right, Payback! Break right!

1319
01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:08.120
Breaking right.

1320
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Oh, my god, here they come!

1321
01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.600
SAM on your six, Rooster!

1322
01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:15.400
Deploying countermeasures.

1323
01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:19.800
Negative contact.

1324
01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:22.920
Dagger One defending.

1325
01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.640
- Talk to me, Bob.
- Break right, Phoenix! Break right!

1326
01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:28.280
Mav! Nine o'clock! Nine o'clock!

1327
01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.559
Rooster, two more on your six.

1328
01:39:31.639 --> 01:39:32.639
Dagger Two, defending.

1329
01:39:37.799 --> 01:39:39.999
- Payback, SAM on your nose!
- Dagger Four defending!

1330
01:39:40.079 --> 01:39:41.879
- Rooster, tally, seven o'clock!
- Talk to me, Bob!

1331
01:39:41.959 --> 01:39:43.199
- On our six!
- Dagger Two defending!

1332
01:39:43.279 --> 01:39:44.879
- Phoenix, break right.
<i>- I see it, I see it!</i>

1333
01:39:52.279 --> 01:39:53.319
Dagger Two defending.

1334
01:39:55.039 --> 01:39:56.199
Shit, I'm out of flares!

1335
01:39:56.559 --> 01:39:57.959
Rooster, evade, evade!

1336
01:39:58.719 --> 01:40:00.599
I can't shake them.
They're on me. They're on me.

1337
01:40:11.079 --> 01:40:12.319
Mav! No!

1338
01:40:14.879 --> 01:40:18.199
Dagger One is hit!
I repeat, Dagger One is hit!

1339
01:40:18.279 --> 01:40:19.399
<i>Maverick is down.</i>

1340
01:40:19.919 --> 01:40:21.039
<i>Dagger One, status.</i>

1341
01:40:21.639 --> 01:40:22.639
<i>Status.</i>

1342
01:40:22.719 --> 01:40:24.919
<i>Anyone see him? Does anyone see
him?</i>

1343
01:40:24.999 --> 01:40:27.279
- Dagger One, come in.
- I didn't see a parachute.

1344
01:40:27.359 --> 01:40:28.559
We have to circle back.

1345
01:40:29.079 --> 01:40:31.599
Comanche. Bandits inbound.
Single group, hot.

1346
01:40:31.679 --> 01:40:33.159
Recommend Dagger flow south.

1347
01:40:34.119 --> 01:40:35.279
<i>One minute to intercept.</i>

1348
01:40:39.359 --> 01:40:40.759
Get them back to the carrier now.

1349
01:40:40.839 --> 01:40:43.479
All Daggers flow to ECP.
You have bandits headed for you.

1350
01:40:43.559 --> 01:40:44.559
What about Maverick?

1351
01:40:44.639 --> 01:40:47.479
Tell him there's nothing he can do
for Maverick, not in a goddamn F-18.

1352
01:40:47.559 --> 01:40:50.599
Dagger Spare request permission
to launch and fly air cover.

1353
01:40:52.919 --> 01:40:53.999
Negative, Spare.

1354
01:40:55.039 --> 01:40:56.519
- Launch search and rescue.
- Negative.

1355
01:40:56.599 --> 01:40:57.599
Not with bandits in the air.

1356
01:40:57.679 --> 01:40:59.039
But, sir, Maverick
is still out there.

1357
01:40:59.119 --> 01:41:00.479
We are not losing anyone else today.

1358
01:41:03.239 --> 01:41:04.239
Get them home now.

1359
01:41:04.799 --> 01:41:06.679
Dagger, you are not to engage.

1360
01:41:07.359 --> 01:41:08.999
Repeat, do not engage.

1361
01:41:09.559 --> 01:41:11.879
<i>Dagger Two, return to carrier.
Acknowledge.</i>

1362
01:41:12.919 --> 01:41:14.239
<i>- Acknowledge.
- Rooster.</i>

1363
01:41:14.319 --> 01:41:17.239
Those bandits are closing.
We can't go back.

1364
01:41:17.599 --> 01:41:20.199
Rooster, he's gone.

1365
01:41:21.799 --> 01:41:22.879
<i>Maverick's gone.</i>

1366
01:42:53.758 --> 01:42:54.838
Oh, no, no.

1367
01:43:01.638 --> 01:43:02.758
<i>Dagger Two is hit.</i>

1368
01:43:04.158 --> 01:43:05.318
Dagger Two is hit.

1369
01:43:06.998 --> 01:43:08.078
Dagger Two, come in.

1370
01:43:09.878 --> 01:43:11.278
Dagger Two, do you copy?

1371
01:43:12.918 --> 01:43:14.078
<i>Dagger Two, come in.</i>

1372
01:43:40.478 --> 01:43:42.038
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1373
01:43:42.118 --> 01:43:43.118
You all right?

1374
01:43:45.158 --> 01:43:46.278
What the hell?

1375
01:43:46.598 --> 01:43:48.758
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

1376
01:43:48.838 --> 01:43:51.478
You think I took that missile
so you could be down here with me?

1377
01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:53.478
You should be back
on the carrier by now!

1378
01:43:53.558 --> 01:43:56.318
- I saved your life!
- I saved your life.

1379
01:43:56.838 --> 01:43:58.118
That's the whole point.

1380
01:43:58.718 --> 01:44:00.358
What the hell were you even thinking?

1381
01:44:00.678 --> 01:44:02.118
You told me not to think.

1382
01:44:19.158 --> 01:44:20.158
Well...

1383
01:44:21.838 --> 01:44:22.958
it's good to see you.

1384
01:44:25.558 --> 01:44:26.638
It's good to see you, too.

1385
01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:32.038
So, what's the plan?

1386
01:44:43.598 --> 01:44:44.638
You're not serious.

1387
01:45:00.558 --> 01:45:01.998
You've gotta be shitting me.

1388
01:45:04.038 --> 01:45:05.118
An F-14?

1389
01:45:05.678 --> 01:45:07.358
I shot down three MiGs
in one of those.

1390
01:45:07.758 --> 01:45:09.478
We don't even know
if that bag of ass can fly.

1391
01:45:12.638 --> 01:45:14.278
- Let's find out.
- Mav.

1392
01:45:16.718 --> 01:45:17.718
Okay.

1393
01:45:27.198 --> 01:45:28.678
- There's guys up there, Mav.
- Yeah.

1394
01:45:30.518 --> 01:45:32.118
- There's more over there.
- Okay.

1395
01:45:33.558 --> 01:45:35.198
- Let's start running.
- Yeah, run. Run.

1396
01:45:45.198 --> 01:45:47.678
Once... Once I give you
the signal for air

1397
01:45:48.318 --> 01:45:50.958
you're gonna flip this switch
until the needle gets to 120.

1398
01:45:51.038 --> 01:45:52.238
When the engine starts

1399
01:45:52.318 --> 01:45:54.838
you gotta pull out the pins
and disconnect everything.

1400
01:45:54.918 --> 01:45:55.917
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1401
01:45:58.717 --> 01:45:59.717
Yes!

1402
01:46:01.797 --> 01:46:03.677
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.

1403
01:46:11.877 --> 01:46:12.877
Okay.

1404
01:46:15.037 --> 01:46:16.437
It's been a minute, huh, Mav?

1405
01:46:45.717 --> 01:46:48.517
Oh, my god. This thing is so old.

1406
01:46:49.117 --> 01:46:50.117
All right.

1407
01:46:55.997 --> 01:46:57.357
- Canopy?
- Clear.

1408
01:47:15.677 --> 01:47:17.157
Both runways are cratered.

1409
01:47:18.117 --> 01:47:20.197
How are we gonna get
this museum piece in the air?

1410
01:47:30.797 --> 01:47:32.037
Why are the wings coming out, Mav?

1411
01:47:38.757 --> 01:47:41.357
Mav, this is a taxiway, not a runway.

1412
01:47:41.797 --> 01:47:44.917
This is a very short taxiway, Mav.

1413
01:47:45.237 --> 01:47:46.237
You just hang on.

1414
01:47:47.837 --> 01:47:48.917
Holy shit.

1415
01:47:55.117 --> 01:47:56.277
Come on...

1416
01:47:56.357 --> 01:47:57.397
Needle's alive. Come on.

1417
01:48:00.837 --> 01:48:02.757
- Mav?
- That's it. Come on, come on.

1418
01:48:03.157 --> 01:48:04.197
All right.

1419
01:48:05.117 --> 01:48:06.997
- Mav.
- Here we go.

1420
01:48:08.557 --> 01:48:09.557
Holy shit.

1421
01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:26.437
Sir, we're receiving a signal
from Rooster's ESAT.

1422
01:48:26.997 --> 01:48:28.237
But there seems to be a malfunction.

1423
01:48:28.757 --> 01:48:30.277
- Have you lost him?
- No, sir.

1424
01:48:31.397 --> 01:48:32.557
He's supersonic.

1425
01:48:33.317 --> 01:48:34.317
He's airborne.

1426
01:48:35.557 --> 01:48:37.157
- In what?
- Sir.

1427
01:48:37.957 --> 01:48:40.637
Overwatch reports
an F-14 Tomcat is airborne

1428
01:48:40.717 --> 01:48:42.077
and on course for our position.

1429
01:48:43.037 --> 01:48:45.237
It can't be. It can't be.

1430
01:48:47.397 --> 01:48:48.397
Maverick.

1431
01:48:50.637 --> 01:48:52.957
Okay, Rooster,
get us in touch with the boat.

1432
01:48:53.037 --> 01:48:54.037
I'm working on it.

1433
01:48:54.517 --> 01:48:58.037
Radio's out. No radar.
Everything's dead back here.

1434
01:48:58.717 --> 01:49:01.077
- What do I do? Talk me through it.
- Okay, first the radio.

1435
01:49:01.197 --> 01:49:02.197
Throw the...

1436
01:49:03.077 --> 01:49:05.357
the UHF-2 circuit breaker.

1437
01:49:05.437 --> 01:49:06.437
Try that.

1438
01:49:07.037 --> 01:49:09.516
There's 300 breakers back here.
Anything more specific?

1439
01:49:09.596 --> 01:49:11.516
I don't know.
That was your dad's department.

1440
01:49:11.596 --> 01:49:12.596
I'll figure it out.

1441
01:49:16.516 --> 01:49:18.236
Mav, tally two, five o'clock low.

1442
01:49:23.836 --> 01:49:24.876
What do we do?

1443
01:49:25.716 --> 01:49:28.036
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

1444
01:49:28.116 --> 01:49:29.836
If they knew who we were,
we'd be dead already.

1445
01:49:32.196 --> 01:49:34.196
Well, here they come.

1446
01:49:34.716 --> 01:49:37.356
- What's your plan?
- Just put your mask on.

1447
01:49:38.516 --> 01:49:40.596
Remember, we're on the same team.

1448
01:49:43.636 --> 01:49:45.076
Just wave and smile.

1449
01:49:46.196 --> 01:49:47.596
<i>Just wave and smile.</i>

1450
01:49:54.996 --> 01:49:56.716
What's that signal? What's he saying?

1451
01:49:56.796 --> 01:49:59.036
No... No idea.
I have no idea what he's saying.

1452
01:50:00.516 --> 01:50:03.156
- What about that one? Any idea?
- No, never seen that one either.

1453
01:50:07.236 --> 01:50:08.236
Oh, shit.

1454
01:50:08.756 --> 01:50:10.916
His wingman is moving
into weapons envelope.

1455
01:50:12.276 --> 01:50:13.436
All right, listen up.

1456
01:50:13.516 --> 01:50:15.596
When I tell you,
you grab those rings above your head.

1457
01:50:16.156 --> 01:50:17.476
That's the ejection handle.

1458
01:50:18.956 --> 01:50:20.956
Mav, can we outrun these guys?

1459
01:50:21.796 --> 01:50:23.196
Not their missiles and guns.

1460
01:50:28.356 --> 01:50:29.596
Then it's a dogfight.

1461
01:50:30.596 --> 01:50:33.316
An F-14 against fifth-gen fighters?

1462
01:50:34.796 --> 01:50:36.796
It's not the plane, it's the pilot.

1463
01:50:38.716 --> 01:50:40.196
You'd go after them if I wasn't here.

1464
01:50:41.396 --> 01:50:42.516
But you are here.

1465
01:50:43.796 --> 01:50:44.796
Come on, Mav.

1466
01:50:46.316 --> 01:50:47.316
Don't think.

1467
01:50:48.636 --> 01:50:49.676
Just do.

1468
01:51:05.476 --> 01:51:07.116
Tell me when you see
smoke in the air!

1469
01:51:11.596 --> 01:51:13.236
- Smoke in the air. Smoke in the air!
- Hang on!

1470
01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:18.716
Yeah, Mav! Splash one, splash one!

1471
01:51:24.556 --> 01:51:25.556
Here comes another one.

1472
01:51:29.036 --> 01:51:30.516
Rooster, flares! Now!

1473
01:51:34.476 --> 01:51:35.476
Splitting the throttles.

1474
01:51:37.916 --> 01:51:39.036
Coming around.

1475
01:51:43.516 --> 01:51:45.756
- Give me tone, give me tone.
- You got him, Mav. You got him.

1476
01:51:45.836 --> 01:51:46.836
Taking the shot.

1477
01:51:53.476 --> 01:51:54.556
What the...

1478
01:51:55.836 --> 01:51:57.876
Holy shit. What the fuck was that?

1479
01:51:59.316 --> 01:52:01.556
Hang on. We got to get low.

1480
01:52:01.636 --> 01:52:03.876
The terrain will confuse
his targeting system.

1481
01:52:06.036 --> 01:52:07.036
Here he comes.

1482
01:52:19.755 --> 01:52:21.315
Talk to me, Rooster. Where is he?

1483
01:52:22.035 --> 01:52:23.075
He's still on us.

1484
01:52:30.635 --> 01:52:32.675
- We took a hit, we took a hit.
- Damn it!

1485
01:52:37.835 --> 01:52:39.515
Come on, Mav.
Do some of that pilot shit.

1486
01:52:39.595 --> 01:52:40.675
Brace yourself.

1487
01:52:50.355 --> 01:52:51.715
Holy shit!

1488
01:52:58.795 --> 01:53:00.395
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1489
01:53:05.035 --> 01:53:06.035
Damn it.

1490
01:53:07.595 --> 01:53:09.515
Out of missiles. Switching to guns.

1491
01:53:15.915 --> 01:53:16.995
Come on, Mav, come on.

1492
01:53:19.715 --> 01:53:21.275
- You got him, Mav.
- It's not over yet.

1493
01:53:26.075 --> 01:53:27.875
- One last chance.
- You can do this.

1494
01:53:29.235 --> 01:53:30.315
Come on, Maverick.

1495
01:53:40.595 --> 01:53:41.915
Yes! Splash two!

1496
01:53:53.075 --> 01:53:55.035
- Mav, I got the radio on.
- Outstanding.

1497
01:53:55.115 --> 01:53:56.915
- Get us in touch with the boat.
- Copy that.

1498
01:53:59.555 --> 01:54:00.555
Oh, my god.

1499
01:54:02.715 --> 01:54:03.955
Where the hell is this guy?

1500
01:54:05.555 --> 01:54:06.555
He's on our nose.

1501
01:54:10.715 --> 01:54:11.875
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

1502
01:54:14.075 --> 01:54:15.915
Smoke in the air! Rooster, flares!

1503
01:54:18.875 --> 01:54:19.875
That was close.

1504
01:54:23.235 --> 01:54:24.595
We're out of flares, Mav.

1505
01:54:29.075 --> 01:54:30.715
Shit, he's already on us.

1506
01:54:35.835 --> 01:54:37.035
This is not good.

1507
01:54:45.515 --> 01:54:47.395
- We took another hit.
- No!

1508
01:54:52.755 --> 01:54:54.395
We can't take much more of this.

1509
01:54:54.475 --> 01:54:56.355
We can't outrun this guy.
We got to eject.

1510
01:54:56.435 --> 01:54:57.715
- What?
- We need altitude.

1511
01:54:57.795 --> 01:54:59.795
Pull the ejection handles
the second I tell you.

1512
01:54:59.875 --> 01:55:01.715
- Mav, wait!
- Rooster, there's no other way!

1513
01:55:05.315 --> 01:55:06.835
Eject, eject, eject!

1514
01:55:08.035 --> 01:55:09.715
Rooster, pull the handle! Eject!

1515
01:55:09.795 --> 01:55:11.435
It's not working.

1516
01:55:22.035 --> 01:55:23.035
Mav!

1517
01:55:25.755 --> 01:55:26.755
I'm sorry.

1518
01:55:28.555 --> 01:55:29.635
I'm sorry, Goose.

1519
01:55:42.714 --> 01:55:44.674
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

1520
01:55:44.754 --> 01:55:46.754
This is your savior speaking.

1521
01:55:47.114 --> 01:55:48.354
<i>Please fasten your seat belts</i>

1522
01:55:48.434 --> 01:55:51.314
<i>return your tray tables
to their locked and upright positions</i>

1523
01:55:52.714 --> 01:55:54.114
<i>and prepare for landing.</i>

1524
01:55:57.234 --> 01:55:59.474
Hey, Hangman, you look good.

1525
01:55:59.554 --> 01:56:02.434
I am good, Rooster. I'm very good.

1526
01:56:04.514 --> 01:56:05.794
<i>I'll see you back on deck.</i>

1527
01:56:28.514 --> 01:56:29.714
<i>Maverick is downwind.</i>

1528
01:56:29.794 --> 01:56:31.754
No front landing gear. No tail hook.

1529
01:56:31.834 --> 01:56:33.114
Pull the cable
and raise the barricade.

1530
01:56:33.194 --> 01:56:35.474
Foul deck, foul deck!
Raise the barricade!

1531
01:56:36.474 --> 01:56:37.914
Go! Hey!

1532
01:57:00.674 --> 01:57:02.394
Please don't tell me
we lost an engine.

1533
01:57:02.794 --> 01:57:04.234
All right, I won't tell you that.

1534
01:57:04.314 --> 01:57:05.314
Okay.

1535
01:57:29.274 --> 01:57:30.554
You good?

1536
01:57:30.634 --> 01:57:32.354
Yeah. I'm good.

1537
01:58:17.914 --> 01:58:19.314
Chalked yourself another kill.

1538
01:58:19.394 --> 01:58:20.554
That makes two.

1539
01:58:21.114 --> 01:58:23.634
Mav has five. Makes him an ace.

1540
01:58:42.154 --> 01:58:44.473
Captain Mitchell. Captain Mitchell.

1541
01:58:51.633 --> 01:58:52.633
Sir.

1542
01:59:00.073 --> 01:59:01.793
Thank you for saving my life.

1543
01:59:03.273 --> 01:59:04.673
It's what my dad would've done.

1544
01:59:44.473 --> 01:59:45.473
Hey, Mav.

1545
01:59:46.273 --> 01:59:47.273
Jimmy.

1546
01:59:48.513 --> 01:59:49.513
Is...

1547
01:59:50.553 --> 01:59:51.633
Is Penny around?

1548
01:59:52.473 --> 01:59:55.073
She took Amelia on a sailing trip.

1549
01:59:58.033 --> 01:59:59.313
Did she say when she'd be back?

1550
02:00:00.233 --> 02:00:01.313
You know, she didn't.

1551
02:00:04.113 --> 02:00:05.193
Can I get you anything?

1552
02:00:19.273 --> 02:00:20.273
Get in there.

1553
