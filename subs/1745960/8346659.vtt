1
00:03:07.772 --> 00:03:10.149
Today, we're looking
at some of the hottest weather...

2
00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.056
Hey.

3
00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:11.687
What is it?

4
00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:15.399
What?

5
00:05:15.483 --> 00:05:18.694
We've been ordered to stand down.
They're scrapping the program.

6
00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:21.947
They say we fell short.

7
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:24.241
The contract threshold is Mach 10.

8
00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:28.454
Mach 10 is supposed to be in two months.
Today's test point is Mach 9.

9
00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.372
Well, that's not good enough.

10
00:05:30.456 --> 00:05:31.832
Says who?

11
00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:33.459
Admiral Cain.

12
00:05:34.752 --> 00:05:36.212
The Drone Ranger.

13
00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:38.797
He wants our budget
for his unmanned program.

14
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:42.384
He's on his way to kill the test
and shut us down personally.

15
00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:57.691
Well, he isn't here yet.

16
00:06:01.946 --> 00:06:03.280
They want Mach 10,

17
00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:05.199
let's give 'em Mach 10.

18
00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:26.136
Now remember,
the contract threshold is Mach 10.

19
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.723
Not 10.1. Not 10.2. Mach 10.

20
00:06:29.807 --> 00:06:31.809
That should keep the program alive.

21
00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:36.272
I don't like that look, Mav.

22
00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:39.817
It's the only one I got.

23
00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.370
Control, this is Darkstar.
How do you read?

24
00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.831
Darkstar, Control. Loud and clear. How me?

25
00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:55.874
Loud and clear.
Takeoff precheck's complete.

26
00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.167
Ready for APU start.

27
00:06:58.127 --> 00:06:59.920
Ready left engine start.

28
00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:03.132
Ready right engine start.

29
00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:05.342
Thumbs for taxi.

30
00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:09.513
We are ready for taxi.

31
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.518
Tower, this is Darkstar
We are taxiing with information Alpha.

32
00:07:14.602 --> 00:07:16.520
Darkstar, you are clear to taxi.

33
00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:19.523
Runway 21. Winds 210, 10.

34
00:07:19.607 --> 00:07:22.109
- Fuel temps are looking good.
- Control concurs.

35
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.862
Battery's holding at 95%.
Cabin pressure looks good.

36
00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:26.155
Control concurs.

37
00:07:26.238 --> 00:07:27.865
Tower, this is Darkstar.
We're ready for takeoff.

38
00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:30.909
Requesting an unrestricted climb
to 600 and above.

39
00:07:30.993 --> 00:07:33.412
Darkstar, the runway and skies are yours.

40
00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.539
Rear Admiral Chester Cain.

41
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.876
Maverick, Cain just pulled up to the gate.

42
00:07:39.627 --> 00:07:41.045
It's not too late to stop, buddy.

43
00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:44.757
You know what happens to you
if you go through with this.

44
00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:49.386
I know what happens
to everyone else if I don't.

45
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.641
Darkstar is ready for takeoff.

46
00:07:56.644 --> 00:07:57.770
Everyone,

47
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.522
go for takeoff, starting with engine.

48
00:08:00.606 --> 00:08:02.399
- Engine, go.
- Thermals, go.

49
00:08:02.483 --> 00:08:04.568
- Fuel, go.
- Electric, go.

50
00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:05.986
Control surfaces, go.

51
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.781
Darkstar, Control.
You're cleared for takeoff.

52
00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:10.407
All right, sweetheart,

53
00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:12.242
one last ride.

54
00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:41.980
Darkstar, you are cleared above 600.
Increase to Mach 3.5.

55
00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:45.901
Cleared above 600. increase to Mach 3.5.

56
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:53.283
Admiral.

57
00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:56.620
- Just in time, sir.
- I'm early. So are you.

58
00:08:56.704 --> 00:08:58.163
You care to explain?

59
00:08:58.247 --> 00:09:00.207
Transitioning to scram jet.

60
00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:16.014
Mav, Admiral Cain is asking...

61
00:09:16.098 --> 00:09:18.559
- Ordering.
- Ordering that we bring her down.

62
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.609
...within six...

63
00:09:27.693 --> 00:09:29.445
This is where we've had trouble
with comms, sir.

64
00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:31.905
It's the Earth's curvature.
It's called "Earth Bulge."

65
00:09:31.989 --> 00:09:33.323
Did anyone offer you a coffee?

66
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:35.909
Okay.

67
00:09:43.876 --> 00:09:45.753
He's at Mach 7, pushing 8.

68
00:09:45.836 --> 00:09:48.046
- Flight data?
- Receiving. Data is good.

69
00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:55.804
Temperature's climbing.
Response is still stable.

70
00:09:55.888 --> 00:09:56.722
We're feeling good.

71
00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:01.727
Mach 8.8.

72
00:10:02.728 --> 00:10:03.729
8.9.

73
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:05.647
Mach 9.

74
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:07.441
He's the fastest man alive.

75
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.337
Talk to me, Goose.

76
00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:31.465
Mach 9.1.

77
00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:33.467
9.2.

78
00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:41.975
Mach 9.3.

79
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:45.896
9.4.

80
00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.358
Approaching high hypersonic.

81
00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.288
Windshield hot caution.

82
00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:14.049
Surface temp rising.

83
00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.390
Come on, sweetheart, just a little more.

84
00:11:22.224 --> 00:11:23.267
Just a little.

85
00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:27.896
Come on!

86
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.404
Come on!

87
00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:41.910
Mach 10!

88
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.415
Put that in your Pentagon budget!

89
00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.543
Sir.

90
00:12:01.138 --> 00:12:02.347
Don't do it. Don't do it.

91
00:12:02.431 --> 00:12:03.432
Just...

92
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.519
a little push.

93
00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:13.400
Holy shit.

94
00:12:22.868 --> 00:12:25.913
You got some balls, stick jockey.

95
00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:27.414
I'll give you that.

96
00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:32.836
Shit.

97
00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:39.134
Maverick.

98
00:12:41.178 --> 00:12:42.471
Maverick!

99
00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:33.814
Thank you.

100
00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:35.816
Where am I?

101
00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:38.485
Earth.

102
00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.418
Maverick.

103
00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:56.837
Thirty-plus years of service.

104
00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.423
Combat medals.

105
00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:00.841
Citations.

106
00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:05.929
Only man to shoot down three enemy planes
in the last 40 years.

107
00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:07.973
"Distinguished."

108
00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:11.643
"Distinguished." "Distinguished."

109
00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:16.690
Yet you can't get a promotion,
you won't retire,

110
00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:19.818
and despite your best efforts,
you refuse to die.

111
00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:24.448
You should be at least a two-star admiral
by now, if not a senator.

112
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.616
Yet here you are:

113
00:14:28.285 --> 00:14:29.369
Captain.

114
00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:31.788
Why is that?

115
00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:34.207
It's one of life's mysteries, sir.

116
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:37.794
This isn't a joke. I asked you a question.

117
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.465
I'm where I belong, sir.

118
00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:44.676
Well, the navy doesn't see it that way.

119
00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:46.803
Not anymore.

120
00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:50.015
These planes you've been testing,

121
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:51.808
Captain,

122
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.353
one day, sooner than later,
they won't need pilots at all.

123
00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:59.441
Pilots that need to sleep, eat,
take a piss.

124
00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.820
Pilots that disobey orders.

125
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.200
All you did was buy some time
for those men out there.

126
00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:11.536
The future is coming,

127
00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:14.414
and you're not in it.

128
00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:18.418
Escort this man off the base.

129
00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:23.924
Take him to his quarters.
Wait with him while he packs his gear.

130
00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.387
I want him on the road to North Island
within the hour.

131
00:15:32.641 --> 00:15:34.184
North Island, sir?

132
00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:37.604
Call came in with impeccable timing,

133
00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:41.358
right as I was driving here
to ground your ass once and for all.

134
00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:45.362
It galls me to say it, but...

135
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.534
for reasons known only to the Almighty
and your guardian angel...

136
00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:54.955
you've been called back to TOPGUN.

137
00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:02.546
- Sir?
- You are dismissed, Captain.

138
00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:09.719
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

139
00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:12.556
Your kind is headed for extinction.

140
00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:17.853
Maybe so, sir.

141
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:20.981
But not today.

142
00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:28.757
Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell.

143
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.426
Your reputation precedes you.

144
00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:33.762
Thank you, sir.

145
00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:36.556
Wasn't a compliment.

146
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.351
I'm Admiral Beau Simpson.

147
00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.603
I'm the Air Boss.
I believe you know Admiral Bates.

148
00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:43.271
Warlock, sir.

149
00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:46.107
Must admit,
I wasn't expecting an invitation back.

150
00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:47.984
They're called orders, Maverick.

151
00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:50.862
You two have something in common.

152
00:17:50.946 --> 00:17:53.740
Cyclone here was first in his class
back in '88.

153
00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:55.784
Actually, sir, I finished second.

154
00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:58.453
Just want to manage expectations.

155
00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:03.917
The target...

156
00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:08.755
is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant

157
00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:11.299
built in violation
of a multilateral NATO treaty.

158
00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:14.344
The uranium produced there
represents a direct threat

159
00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:15.720
to our allies in the region.

160
00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:20.058
The Pentagon has tasked us with assembling
a strike team and taking it out

161
00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.851
before it becomes fully operational.

162
00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:26.731
The plant sits in an underground bunker
at the end of this valley.

163
00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:28.525
Said valley is GPS-jammed

164
00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:31.403
and defended by an extensive
surface-to-air missile array

165
00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:34.155
serving a limited number
of fifth-generation fighters,

166
00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:38.201
which in turn are backed up by
a plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.

167
00:18:38.285 --> 00:18:40.578
Even a few old F-14s.

168
00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:42.956
Seems like we're not the only ones
holding on to old relics.

169
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.251
What's your read, Captain?

170
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.215
Well, sir, normally this would be
a cakewalk for the F-35's stealth,

171
00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:55.010
but the GPS-jamming negates that.

172
00:18:55.093 --> 00:18:58.847
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates
a low-level laser-guided strike

173
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.348
tailor-made for the F-18.

174
00:19:00.432 --> 00:19:01.433
I figure,

175
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.102
two precision bombs, minimum.

176
00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.646
Makes it four aircraft flying in pairs.

177
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.399
That is one hell of a steep climb
out of there,

178
00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.818
exposing you
to all the surface-to-air missiles.

179
00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:13.778
You survive that,

180
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.656
it's a dogfight all the way home.

181
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.367
All requirements for which
you have real-world experience.

182
00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.203
Not in the same mission, sir.

183
00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:25.957
No.

184
00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:31.254
No, someone's not coming back from this.

185
00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.797
Can it be done or not?

186
00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:35.300
How soon before the plant
becomes operational?

187
00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:37.177
Three weeks. Maybe less.

188
00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:41.181
Well, it's been a while
since I've flown an F-18, and...

189
00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.642
I'm not sure who I'd trust
to fly the other three.

190
00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.853
But I'll find a way to make it work.

191
00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.605
I think you misunderstand, Captain.

192
00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:50.148
Sir?

193
00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:53.485
We don't want you to fly it.
We want you to teach it.

194
00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:57.697
Teach, sir?

195
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.744
We've recalled 12 TOPGUN graduates
from their squadrons.

196
00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:05.538
We want you to narrow that pool
down to six.

197
00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:07.791
They'll fly the mission.

198
00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:10.919
Is there a problem, Captain?

199
00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:15.131
You know there is, sir.

200
00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:17.175
Yeah.

201
00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:20.345
Bradley Bradshaw, aka "Rooster."

202
00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:22.263
I understand you used to fly
with his old man.

203
00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:24.140
What was his call sign?

204
00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:26.518
"Goose," sir.

205
00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:27.936
Tragic what happened.

206
00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:29.938
Captain Mitchell was cleared
of any wrongdoing.

207
00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:31.856
Goose's death was an accident.

208
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.566
Is that how you see it, Captain?

209
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.735
Is that how Goose's son sees it?

210
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.741
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not a teacher.

211
00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:43.493
You were a TOPGUN instructor before.

212
00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.995
That was almost 30 years ago.
I lasted two months.

213
00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:47.330
It's not where I belong.

214
00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:49.582
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

215
00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:52.919
You were not my first choice.
In fact, you weren't even on the list.

216
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:56.256
You are here at the request
of Admiral Kazansky.

217
00:20:56.965 --> 00:21:00.635
Now, Iceman happens to be a man
I deeply admire,

218
00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:03.721
and he seems to think that you have
something left to offer the navy.

219
00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:06.641
What that is, I can't imagine.

220
00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:09.978
You don't have to take this job.

221
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:11.312
But let me be clear:

222
00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:14.315
This will be your last post, Captain.

223
00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:19.529
You fly for TOPGUN,
or you don't fly for the navy ever again.

224
00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:29.914
Twenty bucks you can't get three in a row.

225
00:22:11.331 --> 00:22:13.541
You've got to be kidding me.

226
00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:17.212
Pete.

227
00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:19.714
Penny?

228
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:24.093
- What are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same thing.

229
00:22:25.345 --> 00:22:27.555
- Well, that is a long story.
- I doubt that.

230
00:22:27.639 --> 00:22:28.473
Yeah.

231
00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:30.350
Who'd you piss off this time?

232
00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:31.851
Another admiral.

233
00:22:31.935 --> 00:22:32.936
Exactly.

234
00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:37.815
- Are you mad at me?
- Pete.

235
00:22:38.775 --> 00:22:41.945
I can never stay mad at you.
That's the problem.

236
00:22:43.404 --> 00:22:44.697
I got to say,

237
00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:48.326
North Island is the one place
I thought for sure I'd never run into you.

238
00:22:48.826 --> 00:22:51.788
- How long you been here?
- Bought this place about three years ago.

239
00:22:51.871 --> 00:22:53.706
- Three years?
- Yeah.

240
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:58.294
Not long after you got shipped off to the
desert for pissing off that other admiral.

241
00:22:59.212 --> 00:23:01.339
That was three years ago?

242
00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:04.634
You must be in a lot of trouble.

243
00:23:05.218 --> 00:23:07.303
No way you'd come back here willingly.

244
00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:10.139
Well,

245
00:23:10.974 --> 00:23:12.559
you'll sort it out.

246
00:23:13.226 --> 00:23:14.435
No, I think...

247
00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:18.314
- I think this is it.
- Come on, Pete.

248
00:23:18.398 --> 00:23:21.150
You've been saying that
as long as I've known you.

249
00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:24.862
You said it after they busted you for
taking me on a joyride in that F-18.

250
00:23:25.446 --> 00:23:27.865
Then the next thing I know,
you're off to Bosnia.

251
00:23:28.491 --> 00:23:31.077
Then Iraq. Both times.

252
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.787
You get yourself in trouble,

253
00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:36.791
Iceman makes a call,
and you're back in the air.

254
00:23:36.874 --> 00:23:38.418
Penny, this is different.

255
00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:40.003
Pete, trust me,

256
00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:42.338
as improbable as it seems right now,

257
00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:45.758
somehow you'll be back in a fighter plane
with your tail on fire.

258
00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:48.928
- Penny...
- Too late.

259
00:23:49.012 --> 00:23:49.846
What?

260
00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:52.098
You were about to ask me
what time I get off.

261
00:23:55.685 --> 00:23:57.353
Don't give me that look.

262
00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:00.982
I'm not giving you any look. I swear.

263
00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:04.193
It always ends the same with us, Pete.

264
00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:07.530
Let's not start this time.

265
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:12.785
Okay.

266
00:24:13.703 --> 00:24:14.704
Okay.

267
00:24:19.542 --> 00:24:20.877
You look good.

268
00:24:31.054 --> 00:24:32.639
Much appreciated, pal.

269
00:24:35.391 --> 00:24:36.476
What am I missing?

270
00:24:38.895 --> 00:24:42.815
"Disrespect a lady, the navy,
or put your cell phone on my bar..."

271
00:24:42.899 --> 00:24:44.776
"... And you buy a round ."

272
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.486
For everyone?

273
00:24:46.569 --> 00:24:49.322
I'm afraid rules are rules.
You're lucky it's early.

274
00:24:50.531 --> 00:24:52.158
Come on!

275
00:24:52.742 --> 00:24:54.702
What do we have here?

276
00:24:56.412 --> 00:24:58.665
If it ain't Phoenix!

277
00:24:58.748 --> 00:25:01.167
And here I thought we were special,
Coyote.

278
00:25:02.585 --> 00:25:05.463
Turns out the invite went to anyone.

279
00:25:06.255 --> 00:25:07.882
Fellas, this here's Bagman.

280
00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:09.717
- Hangman.
- Whatever.

281
00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:12.512
You're looking at the only naval aviator
on active duty

282
00:25:12.595 --> 00:25:14.097
with a confirmed air-to-air kill.

283
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.014
Stop.

284
00:25:15.098 --> 00:25:19.102
Mind you, the other guy was in
a museum piece from the Korean War.

285
00:25:19.185 --> 00:25:21.938
- Cold War.
- Different wars, same century.

286
00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:23.022
Not this one.

287
00:25:23.106 --> 00:25:24.482
Who are your friends?

288
00:25:24.565 --> 00:25:26.567
- Payback.
- Fanboy.

289
00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:28.653
- Hey, Coyote.
- Hey.

290
00:25:28.736 --> 00:25:30.279
- Who's he?
- Who's who?

291
00:25:33.366 --> 00:25:34.659
When did you get in?

292
00:25:35.284 --> 00:25:37.370
I've been here the whole time.

293
00:25:38.037 --> 00:25:40.081
- The man's a stealth pilot.
- Literally.

294
00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:42.542
Weapons systems officer, actually.

295
00:25:43.209 --> 00:25:44.627
With no sense of humor.

296
00:25:46.587 --> 00:25:47.755
What do they call you?

297
00:25:48.464 --> 00:25:49.799
Bob.

298
00:25:49.882 --> 00:25:51.134
No, your call sign.

299
00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:55.054
Bob.

300
00:25:55.555 --> 00:25:56.472
Bob Floyd.

301
00:25:57.348 --> 00:26:00.184
You're my new backseater? From Lemoore?

302
00:26:01.352 --> 00:26:03.062
Looks like it. Yeah.

303
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:07.984
Nine-ball, Bob.

304
00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:09.569
Rack 'em.

305
00:26:11.571 --> 00:26:12.822
Okay.

306
00:26:13.489 --> 00:26:15.491
- Penny, my dear.
- Yeah.

307
00:26:15.575 --> 00:26:17.744
I'll have four more on the old-timer.

308
00:26:34.594 --> 00:26:36.095
Bradshaw!

309
00:26:36.846 --> 00:26:38.347
Is that you?

310
00:26:43.978 --> 00:26:46.105
This is how I find out you're stateside?

311
00:26:46.189 --> 00:26:48.065
Yeah, I just thought I'd surprise you.

312
00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.987
I guess I surprised you back.

313
00:26:54.697 --> 00:26:56.491
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

314
00:26:59.202 --> 00:27:00.953
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

315
00:27:01.037 --> 00:27:02.747
Much appreciated, Pops.

316
00:27:10.213 --> 00:27:13.049
How about ringing me up
before the evening rush?

317
00:27:27.188 --> 00:27:28.439
Bradshaw.

318
00:27:28.523 --> 00:27:30.107
As I live and breathe.

319
00:27:30.942 --> 00:27:31.943
Hangman.

320
00:27:32.026 --> 00:27:34.195
You look... good.

321
00:27:35.363 --> 00:27:37.114
Well, I am good, Rooster.

322
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:39.951
I'm very good.

323
00:27:40.535 --> 00:27:42.078
In fact,

324
00:27:42.161 --> 00:27:43.955
I am too good to be true.

325
00:27:44.038 --> 00:27:45.289
So,

326
00:27:45.373 --> 00:27:47.917
anybody know what this special
detachment is all about?

327
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.045
No, mission's a mission.
They don't confront me.

328
00:27:51.796 --> 00:27:54.757
What I want to know:
Who's gonna be team leader?

329
00:27:55.466 --> 00:27:59.470
And which one of y'all has what it takes
to follow me?

330
00:28:00.972 --> 00:28:04.475
Hangman, the only place you'll lead anyone
is an early grave.

331
00:28:13.317 --> 00:28:17.071
Well, anyone who follows you
is just gonna run out of fuel.

332
00:28:17.905 --> 00:28:20.199
But that's just you, ain't it, Rooster?

333
00:28:20.992 --> 00:28:23.494
You're snug on that perch,

334
00:28:23.578 --> 00:28:25.788
waiting for just the right moment...

335
00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:29.250
that never comes.

336
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.589
I love this song!

337
00:28:41.721 --> 00:28:43.389
Well, he hasn't changed.

338
00:28:44.432 --> 00:28:46.601
Nope. Sure hasn't.

339
00:28:51.188 --> 00:28:52.231
Check it out.

340
00:28:53.316 --> 00:28:54.442
More patches.

341
00:28:54.984 --> 00:28:58.070
That's Harvard, Yale, Omaha.
Shit, that's Fritz.

342
00:28:58.154 --> 00:29:00.364
What the hell kind of mission is this?

343
00:29:01.365 --> 00:29:03.367
That's not the question
we should be asking.

344
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.162
Everyone here is the best there is.

345
00:29:07.663 --> 00:29:09.624
Who the hell are they gonna get
to teach us?

346
00:29:13.044 --> 00:29:14.587
It's been declined.

347
00:29:15.171 --> 00:29:16.005
You're kidding.

348
00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:33.940
Hey, guys. Come on.

349
00:29:48.037 --> 00:29:49.080
How about...

350
00:29:50.623 --> 00:29:52.375
That won't cover it.

351
00:29:57.838 --> 00:30:00.341
I'll come by tomorrow
and bring you the cash.

352
00:30:00.424 --> 00:30:03.302
I'm afraid rules are rules, Pete.

353
00:30:09.392 --> 00:30:12.269
Overboard! Overboard!

354
00:30:13.187 --> 00:30:14.480
Really?

355
00:30:15.481 --> 00:30:18.567
Overboard! Overboard!

356
00:30:25.783 --> 00:30:27.660
Great to see you, Pete!

357
00:30:28.327 --> 00:30:31.163
Overboard! Overboard!

358
00:30:34.792 --> 00:30:37.169
Thanks for the beers! Come back anytime!

359
00:30:48.806 --> 00:30:51.308
You shake my nerves
And you rattle my brain

360
00:30:51.392 --> 00:30:54.270
Too much love drives a man insane

361
00:30:54.353 --> 00:30:57.023
You broke my will, but what a thrill

362
00:30:57.106 --> 00:31:00.317
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

363
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:03.070
I laughed at love
'Cause I thought it was funny

364
00:31:03.154 --> 00:31:06.282
But you came along and you moved me, honey

365
00:31:06.365 --> 00:31:09.118
I changed my mind, this love is fine

366
00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:11.954
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

367
00:31:12.038 --> 00:31:14.331
Kiss me, baby

368
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.757
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

369
00:31:39.231 --> 00:31:42.318
Altitude 8, 000... 7, 000...

370
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:44.737
Goose, I can't reach the ejection handle.

371
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.822
Eject, eject, eject!

372
00:31:52.745 --> 00:31:54.246
Goose! No!

373
00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:57.124
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.

374
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.419
Attention on deck!

375
00:32:53.347 --> 00:32:54.390
Morning.

376
00:32:55.057 --> 00:32:57.226
Welcome to your special training
detachment.

377
00:32:57.309 --> 00:32:58.352
Be seated.

378
00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:01.605
I'm Admiral Bates, NAWDC commander.

379
00:33:01.689 --> 00:33:03.440
You're all TOPGUN graduates.

380
00:33:04.233 --> 00:33:05.526
The elite.

381
00:33:05.609 --> 00:33:07.611
The best of the best.

382
00:33:08.195 --> 00:33:10.030
That was yesterday.

383
00:33:11.073 --> 00:33:15.077
The enemy's new fifth-generation fighter
has leveled the playing field.

384
00:33:15.161 --> 00:33:16.787
Details are few, but you can be sure

385
00:33:16.871 --> 00:33:18.914
we no longer possess
the technological advantage.

386
00:33:18.998 --> 00:33:22.293
Success, now more than ever,

387
00:33:22.376 --> 00:33:25.546
comes down to the man or woman in the box.

388
00:33:26.463 --> 00:33:28.757
Half of you will make the cut.

389
00:33:28.841 --> 00:33:30.718
One of you will be named mission leader.

390
00:33:31.468 --> 00:33:33.971
The other half will remain in reserve.

391
00:33:34.972 --> 00:33:36.974
Your instructor is a TOPGUN graduate

392
00:33:37.057 --> 00:33:39.602
with real-world experience
in every mission aspect

393
00:33:39.685 --> 00:33:41.270
you will be expected to master.

394
00:33:42.229 --> 00:33:44.440
His exploits are legendary.

395
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.068
And he's considered
to be one of the finest pilots

396
00:33:48.152 --> 00:33:50.154
this program has ever produced.

397
00:33:51.572 --> 00:33:53.157
What he has to teach you

398
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.619
may very well mean the difference
between life and death.

399
00:33:57.453 --> 00:33:59.788
I give you Captain Pete Mitchell.

400
00:34:00.289 --> 00:34:03.083
Call sign: "Maverick."

401
00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:08.631
Good morning.

402
00:34:17.014 --> 00:34:18.682
The F-18 NATOPS.

403
00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:23.771
It contains everything they want you
to know about your aircraft.

404
00:34:24.772 --> 00:34:27.566
I'm assuming you know the book
inside and out.

405
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:28.901
- Damn right.
- Damn straight.

406
00:34:28.984 --> 00:34:30.152
You got it.

407
00:34:38.202 --> 00:34:39.703
So does your enemy.

408
00:34:40.287 --> 00:34:41.789
And we're off.

409
00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:46.043
But what the enemy doesn't know
is your limits.

410
00:34:46.835 --> 00:34:48.545
I intend to find them,

411
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:50.256
test them,

412
00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:52.216
push beyond.

413
00:34:53.384 --> 00:34:56.971
Today we'll start
with what you only think you know.

414
00:34:58.889 --> 00:35:00.683
You show me what you're made of.

415
00:35:05.813 --> 00:35:06.814
Rooster.

416
00:35:07.982 --> 00:35:09.024
Bradley.

417
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:11.402
Lieutenant Bradshaw!

418
00:35:13.404 --> 00:35:14.405
Yes, sir.

419
00:35:15.406 --> 00:35:17.116
Let's not do it like this.

420
00:35:17.908 --> 00:35:19.285
You gonna wash me out?

421
00:35:20.911 --> 00:35:22.621
That'll be up to you, not me.

422
00:35:24.915 --> 00:35:26.292
Am I dismissed?

423
00:35:43.851 --> 00:35:46.270
Good morning, aviators.
This is your captain speaking.

424
00:35:46.353 --> 00:35:48.480
Welcome to basic fighter maneuvers.

425
00:35:50.024 --> 00:35:52.985
As briefed,
today's exercise is dogfighting.

426
00:35:53.068 --> 00:35:54.695
Guns only, no missiles.

427
00:35:55.696 --> 00:35:58.824
We do not go below the hard deck
of 5,000 feet.

428
00:35:58.907 --> 00:36:01.827
Working as a team,
you have to shoot me down, or else.

429
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:05.247
- Or else what, sir?
- Or else I shoot back.

430
00:36:05.331 --> 00:36:08.250
If I shoot either one of you down,
you both lose.

431
00:36:08.334 --> 00:36:10.210
This guy needs an ego check.

432
00:36:10.294 --> 00:36:11.628
We'll see to that.

433
00:36:11.712 --> 00:36:14.381
- What say we put some skin in the game?
- What do you have in mind?

434
00:36:14.465 --> 00:36:17.343
Whoever gets shot down first
has to do 200 push-ups.

435
00:36:17.426 --> 00:36:20.179
Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

436
00:36:20.262 --> 00:36:22.389
They don't call it an exercise
for nothing, sir.

437
00:36:22.473 --> 00:36:24.391
You got yourself a deal, gentlemen.

438
00:36:24.475 --> 00:36:26.769
Fight's on. Let's turn and burn.

439
00:36:28.354 --> 00:36:29.605
Fanboy, you see him?

440
00:36:29.688 --> 00:36:32.691
Nothing on radar up ahead.
He must be somewhere behind us.

441
00:36:35.319 --> 00:36:36.945
- Damn it!
- What the hell?

442
00:36:37.029 --> 00:36:37.863
Shit!

443
00:36:42.576 --> 00:36:43.410
Easy, Maverick.

444
00:36:43.494 --> 00:36:46.580
Let's try not to get fired
on the first day.

445
00:36:46.663 --> 00:36:49.583
Tally, tally, tally! Maverick's coming in!
Break left!

446
00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:50.834
Breaking left.

447
00:36:52.836 --> 00:36:54.880
Payback, where's your wingman?

448
00:36:54.963 --> 00:36:57.174
- Rooster, where are you?
- I got your back.

449
00:36:57.257 --> 00:36:59.760
I'm coming. Hang in there. Hang in there.

450
00:36:59.843 --> 00:37:01.178
Hurry up, man! Hurry up!

451
00:37:04.932 --> 00:37:06.892
- Payback, break right.
- Breaking right.

452
00:37:08.268 --> 00:37:11.688
Rooster just saved your life, fellas.
But it's gonna cost him.

453
00:37:11.772 --> 00:37:13.440
Not this time, old man.

454
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:17.736
Don't let him get to you, Maverick.

455
00:37:24.701 --> 00:37:27.329
Rooster, you're too low! Pull up!
You're hitting the hard deck!

456
00:37:27.413 --> 00:37:29.915
- Altitude. Altitude.
- Shit.

457
00:37:34.336 --> 00:37:35.337
That's a kill.

458
00:37:35.421 --> 00:37:37.798
Down! 109.

459
00:37:38.757 --> 00:37:41.385
Down! 110.

460
00:37:43.303 --> 00:37:45.055
That should be us down there.

461
00:37:45.139 --> 00:37:46.265
But it's not.

462
00:37:47.057 --> 00:37:49.560
And now you know a little something
about Rooster.

463
00:37:51.562 --> 00:37:53.689
Hold that tarmac down till we get back,
brother, all right?

464
00:37:53.772 --> 00:37:55.482
Get in there, boys.

465
00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.362
- That's a kill.
- Damn!

466
00:38:01.113 --> 00:38:02.698
- Smoked.
- Damn it.

467
00:38:03.407 --> 00:38:06.034
It was all fun and games in that selfie,
wasn't it? Down!

468
00:38:06.118 --> 00:38:06.952
Say, Phoenix.

469
00:38:07.035 --> 00:38:09.872
How's about we tell everybody
"Bob" stands for something?

470
00:38:09.955 --> 00:38:12.291
- Other than Robert, I mean.
- Don't take the bait, Bob.

471
00:38:12.374 --> 00:38:14.418
Want to know why we call him Hangman?

472
00:38:14.501 --> 00:38:16.753
I got it. "Baby On Board ."

473
00:38:19.173 --> 00:38:20.632
Shit!

474
00:38:21.925 --> 00:38:23.844
Greetings, aviators. Fight's on.

475
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.722
All right, Phoenix,
let's take this guy out!

476
00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:27.973
Watch your back, Phoenix.

477
00:38:28.056 --> 00:38:29.933
- Break right!
- Breaking right.

478
00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:33.353
Where's he going?

479
00:38:33.437 --> 00:38:36.523
That's why we call him Hangman.
He'll always hang you out to dry.

480
00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:39.026
Leaving your wingman.

481
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:40.777
There's a strategy
I haven't seen in a while.

482
00:38:40.861 --> 00:38:43.280
He called you a man, Phoenix.
You gonna take that?

483
00:38:43.363 --> 00:38:44.781
So long as he doesn't call you a man.

484
00:38:44.865 --> 00:38:46.825
Talk to me, Bob. Where's Maverick?

485
00:38:46.909 --> 00:38:48.911
Jesus, his nose is already coming around!

486
00:38:48.994 --> 00:38:50.370
Get him off me, Hangman!

487
00:38:50.454 --> 00:38:54.416
For all you folks at home,
this is how you bury a fossil.

488
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.127
All right, Hangman.
Time to teach you a lesson.

489
00:38:57.211 --> 00:38:59.087
- You're out, Phoenix.
- Son of a bitch!

490
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.381
That's it.

491
00:39:01.465 --> 00:39:03.967
- Let's go, Mav. Let's see what you got.
- Come get me.

492
00:39:06.386 --> 00:39:08.096
Evil be gone. Hangman's coming.

493
00:39:09.306 --> 00:39:11.517
Yeah, you're good. I'll give you that.

494
00:39:18.023 --> 00:39:21.276
Shit.
Phoenix, I can't see him. How close am I?

495
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.737
- Phoenix?
- I'm dead, dickhead.

496
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.697
See you in the afterlife, Bagman.

497
00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:28.700
Where is he? Where is he?

498
00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:30.702
That's a kill.

499
00:39:31.411 --> 00:39:34.998
Seventy-nine. Down. Eighty. Down.

500
00:39:35.082 --> 00:39:36.250
Let's go. Who's next?

501
00:39:37.501 --> 00:39:39.253
- I got you, Omaha.
- Damn it!

502
00:39:42.297 --> 00:39:44.550
- Lights out, Coyote.
- Copy kill.

503
00:39:44.633 --> 00:39:49.096
Down. Fifty-one. Down. Fifty-two.

504
00:39:51.932 --> 00:39:54.935
So, Rooster, mind if I ask you
a personal question?

505
00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:56.311
Would it matter if I did?

506
00:39:56.395 --> 00:39:58.647
What's the story with you and Maverick?

507
00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.775
- It seems like he's got you rattled.
- That's none of your business.

508
00:40:01.858 --> 00:40:03.694
Now where the hell is he?

509
00:40:03.777 --> 00:40:05.445
Been here the whole time.

510
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:08.365
Holy shit.

511
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:11.618
You see me now?

512
00:40:12.536 --> 00:40:14.329
Come on, let's get it over with.

513
00:40:14.955 --> 00:40:16.373
Fight's on!

514
00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:20.419
What is with these two?

515
00:40:24.965 --> 00:40:28.427
All right, you put us here.
How you gonna get yourself out?

516
00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:31.096
You can bail out anytime.

517
00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:32.514
How low you want to go, Rooster?

518
00:40:32.598 --> 00:40:35.851
I can go as low as you, sir!
And that's saying something.

519
00:40:39.646 --> 00:40:41.690
What's past is past. For both of us.

520
00:40:41.773 --> 00:40:43.609
You'd like to believe that, wouldn't you?

521
00:40:43.692 --> 00:40:46.778
Hard deck is 5,000 feet, fellas.
You are running out of room.

522
00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:48.780
Altitude.

523
00:40:48.864 --> 00:40:50.866
Your strategy
is about to run us into the ground.

524
00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:53.410
- What's your move?
- Altitude. Altitude.

525
00:40:53.493 --> 00:40:54.870
Altitude.

526
00:40:56.663 --> 00:40:59.541
Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.

527
00:40:59.625 --> 00:41:02.044
Altitude. Altitude.

528
00:41:04.087 --> 00:41:06.757
Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up!

529
00:41:07.466 --> 00:41:08.467
Pull up! Pull up!

530
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.430
You got it. Don't think, just do.

531
00:41:14.598 --> 00:41:17.142
Come on, Rooster, you got him!
Drop down and take the shot!

532
00:41:18.769 --> 00:41:19.686
It's too low.

533
00:41:20.729 --> 00:41:22.439
Too late. You had your chance.

534
00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:31.323
That's a kill. Knock it off.

535
00:41:32.324 --> 00:41:33.450
Damn it!

536
00:41:33.533 --> 00:41:35.410
Same old Rooster.

537
00:41:37.954 --> 00:41:40.290
Go see Hondo about your push-ups.

538
00:41:48.507 --> 00:41:50.008
All right, that's enough.

539
00:41:50.676 --> 00:41:52.761
Rooster. That's enough, man.

540
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:10.821
Breaking the hard deck, insubordination.
Are you trying to get kicked out?

541
00:42:10.904 --> 00:42:12.364
Don't worry about it.

542
00:42:12.864 --> 00:42:15.367
Look, I'm going on this mission.

543
00:42:16.326 --> 00:42:19.121
But if you get kicked out,
you leave us flying with Hangman.

544
00:42:19.746 --> 00:42:23.375
- Talk to me. What the hell was that?
- He pulled my papers.

545
00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:26.920
- What? Who?
- Maverick.

546
00:42:28.088 --> 00:42:30.632
He pulled my application
to the Naval Academy.

547
00:42:31.717 --> 00:42:33.719
Set me back four years.

548
00:42:36.221 --> 00:42:37.681
Why would he do that?

549
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.064
The hard deck is 5,000 feet
above ground level.

550
00:42:46.148 --> 00:42:48.483
A parameter is set
not just for the safety of our pilots,

551
00:42:48.567 --> 00:42:50.068
but for the safety of their aircraft.

552
00:42:50.152 --> 00:42:54.364
5,000 feet is not just a rule.
It is a law, as immutable as gravity.

553
00:42:54.448 --> 00:42:57.117
The hard deck will be much lower
for the mission, sir.

554
00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.328
And it will not change
without my approval!

555
00:43:00.412 --> 00:43:02.330
Especially not in the middle
of an exercise.

556
00:43:02.998 --> 00:43:06.376
And that Cobra maneuver of yours?
That could've got all three of you killed.

557
00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.336
I never want to see that shit again.

558
00:43:09.421 --> 00:43:11.673
What exactly do you suppose
you were teaching, Captain?

559
00:43:11.757 --> 00:43:14.176
That as good as they are, sir,
they still have something to learn.

560
00:43:14.259 --> 00:43:16.845
You are talking about the best
fighter pilots on the planet, Captain.

561
00:43:16.928 --> 00:43:18.680
And they've been told that
their entire career,

562
00:43:18.764 --> 00:43:20.640
while they've been dropping bombs
from a high altitude

563
00:43:20.724 --> 00:43:22.476
with little to no dogfighting.

564
00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:25.312
The parameters of this mission call for
something they have never encountered.

565
00:43:25.395 --> 00:43:29.107
Okay, you have less than three weeks
to teach them how to fight as a team

566
00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:31.234
and how to strike the target.

567
00:43:31.318 --> 00:43:33.069
And how to come home.

568
00:43:35.906 --> 00:43:37.908
And how to come home, sir.

569
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.248
Every mission has its risks.

570
00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:48.001
These pilots accept that.

571
00:43:48.084 --> 00:43:49.669
I don't, sir.

572
00:43:53.882 --> 00:43:55.217
Every morning, from this day forward,

573
00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.011
you will brief us on
your instructional plans in writing.

574
00:43:58.094 --> 00:44:01.014
And nothing will change
without my express approval.

575
00:44:01.097 --> 00:44:04.267
- Including the hard deck, sir?
- Especially the hard deck, Captain.

576
00:44:06.353 --> 00:44:07.437
Sir.

577
00:44:08.355 --> 00:44:09.564
What is this?

578
00:44:09.648 --> 00:44:11.316
It's a request to lower
the hard deck, sir,

579
00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:13.819
to practice a low-level bombing run
per the mission parameters.

580
00:44:19.908 --> 00:44:22.536
You could learn a thing or two
about timing, Captain.

581
00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:24.329
Yo, Coyote.

582
00:44:25.038 --> 00:44:26.331
Take a look at this.

583
00:44:30.252 --> 00:44:32.963
The man, the legend. There he is.

584
00:44:33.046 --> 00:44:35.048
No, no, no. Next to him.

585
00:44:36.007 --> 00:44:38.051
He look familiar to you?

586
00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:41.596
What have we here?

587
00:44:42.389 --> 00:44:44.099
Bradshaw.

588
00:44:45.058 --> 00:44:46.726
As I live and breathe.

589
00:44:49.896 --> 00:44:52.482
Hey, Theo, you got big.

590
00:44:53.316 --> 00:44:54.442
Hey, Mav.

591
00:45:01.533 --> 00:45:02.576
Amelia?

592
00:45:02.659 --> 00:45:04.202
I know. I got big.

593
00:45:04.286 --> 00:45:05.537
Yes.

594
00:45:06.621 --> 00:45:07.914
Bar opens at 5:00.

595
00:45:08.748 --> 00:45:10.750
No, I just came by to pay off a debt.

596
00:45:10.834 --> 00:45:12.085
Mom!

597
00:45:16.798 --> 00:45:19.759
- Hey, how's your dad?
- With his wife, in Hawaii.

598
00:45:19.843 --> 00:45:21.219
Mom!

599
00:45:22.178 --> 00:45:24.306
Mav says he owes you money.

600
00:45:25.807 --> 00:45:27.809
- Don't worry about it.
- I insist.

601
00:45:31.021 --> 00:45:34.691
Thank you, Captain.
Consider your tab closed.

602
00:45:35.692 --> 00:45:37.569
Captain? Still?

603
00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:40.322
A highly decorated captain.

604
00:45:40.405 --> 00:45:41.448
Finish up.

605
00:45:41.531 --> 00:45:43.325
We have to get the boat to the yard.

606
00:45:43.408 --> 00:45:45.368
- I can't go.
- What do you mean, you can't go?

607
00:45:45.452 --> 00:45:48.788
Test tomorrow. I have to study.
They only told us today.

608
00:45:48.872 --> 00:45:50.832
Well, I can't sail her alone.

609
00:45:50.916 --> 00:45:52.334
Just use the engine.

610
00:45:52.417 --> 00:45:54.586
Why are we taking her to the yard?

611
00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:56.671
To fix the engine.

612
00:45:57.464 --> 00:45:58.465
I can help.

613
00:46:04.721 --> 00:46:07.933
- Little rougher than I was expecting.
- You don't say.

614
00:46:08.642 --> 00:46:11.603
Pull on the backstay.
We'll de-power the sails.

615
00:46:11.686 --> 00:46:12.687
Okay.

616
00:46:13.229 --> 00:46:14.814
What does that mean?

617
00:46:16.232 --> 00:46:18.485
You're supposed to be in the navy!

618
00:46:18.568 --> 00:46:21.905
I don't sail boats, Penny. I land on them.

619
00:46:22.447 --> 00:46:25.659
It's sort of like raising the flaps
on an airplane.

620
00:46:25.742 --> 00:46:27.202
So how do I do that?

621
00:46:27.953 --> 00:46:30.163
You pull on that green line up there.

622
00:46:30.246 --> 00:46:31.581
Green line.

623
00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:35.669
Yep. Pull it hard.

624
00:46:35.752 --> 00:46:38.672
Yep. Crank that winch right there,

625
00:46:38.755 --> 00:46:40.548
tighten the jib.

626
00:46:41.257 --> 00:46:43.593
- Crank it. You okay?
- Yeah.

627
00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:46.096
Good.

628
00:46:47.347 --> 00:46:48.348
Now,

629
00:46:49.766 --> 00:46:51.184
you ready?

630
00:46:53.103 --> 00:46:54.187
For what?

631
00:46:54.771 --> 00:46:56.314
The afterburner.

632
00:47:16.626 --> 00:47:18.461
Now you're in the navy.

633
00:47:40.734 --> 00:47:42.569
Thanks for helping out today.

634
00:47:44.279 --> 00:47:45.697
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

635
00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:52.662
Don't give me that look.

636
00:47:52.746 --> 00:47:54.080
What look?

637
00:47:54.164 --> 00:47:55.790
That one.

638
00:47:59.085 --> 00:48:00.378
Good night, Pete.

639
00:48:01.171 --> 00:48:02.505
Night, Penny.

640
00:48:17.979 --> 00:48:19.481
Mom, is that you?

641
00:48:20.106 --> 00:48:21.399
Yeah, it's me.

642
00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.110
I'll make you dinner.

643
00:48:24.194 --> 00:48:25.195
Okay.

644
00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:33.661
Time is your greatest enemy.

645
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.207
Phase one of the mission
will be a low-level ingress

646
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.042
attacking in two-plane teams.

647
00:48:39.626 --> 00:48:41.836
You'll fly along this narrow canyon
to your target.

648
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.340
Radar-guided surface-to-air missiles
defend the area.

649
00:48:45.423 --> 00:48:47.675
These SAMs, they're lethal.

650
00:48:48.343 --> 00:48:52.222
But they were designed to protect
the skies above, not the canyon below.

651
00:48:52.305 --> 00:48:56.184
That's because the enemy knows no one is
insane enough to try and fly below them.

652
00:48:57.102 --> 00:48:59.062
That's exactly
what I'm gonna train you to do.

653
00:49:00.105 --> 00:49:04.317
On the day, your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum.

654
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.529
You exceed this altitude,
radar will spot you,

655
00:49:08.404 --> 00:49:09.906
and you're dead.

656
00:49:11.032 --> 00:49:12.992
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

657
00:49:13.827 --> 00:49:15.078
minimum.

658
00:49:15.161 --> 00:49:17.497
Time to target: two and a half minutes.

659
00:49:18.081 --> 00:49:21.835
That's because fifth-generation fighters
wait at an air base nearby.

660
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:27.132
In a head-to-head with these planes
in your F-18s, you're dead.

661
00:49:27.882 --> 00:49:30.844
That's why you need to get in,
hit your target and be gone

662
00:49:30.927 --> 00:49:34.097
before these planes
even have a chance of catching you.

663
00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:37.016
This makes time your greatest adversary.

664
00:49:38.852 --> 00:49:42.147
You'll fly a route in your nav system
that simulates the canyon.

665
00:49:42.939 --> 00:49:44.607
The faster you navigate this canyon,

666
00:49:44.691 --> 00:49:47.360
the harder it'll be to stay
under the radar of these enemy SAMs.

667
00:49:48.361 --> 00:49:49.487
The tighter the turns,

668
00:49:49.571 --> 00:49:52.782
the more intensely the force of gravity
on your body multiplies,

669
00:49:53.449 --> 00:49:55.201
compressing your lungs,

670
00:49:55.285 --> 00:49:56.703
forcing the blood from your brain,

671
00:49:56.786 --> 00:49:59.998
impairing your judgment and reaction time.

672
00:50:00.081 --> 00:50:02.458
So for today's lesson,
we're gonna take it easy on you.

673
00:50:02.542 --> 00:50:05.545
Max ceiling: 300 feet.
Time to target: three minutes.

674
00:50:07.422 --> 00:50:08.631
Good luck.

675
00:50:17.056 --> 00:50:18.850
Time to target is one minute 30.

676
00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:21.352
We are two seconds behind.
Increase to 480 knots.

677
00:50:21.436 --> 00:50:22.687
We got to move, Coyote.

678
00:50:23.563 --> 00:50:25.231
Copy. Increasing speed.

679
00:50:27.609 --> 00:50:28.526
Shit!

680
00:50:32.322 --> 00:50:33.364
Why are they dead?

681
00:50:33.448 --> 00:50:36.242
We broke the 300-foot ceiling,
and a SAM took us out.

682
00:50:36.326 --> 00:50:37.952
No. Why are they dead?

683
00:50:38.036 --> 00:50:40.371
I slowed down and didn't give her
a warning. It was my fault.

684
00:50:40.455 --> 00:50:42.290
Was there a reason
you didn't communicate with your team?

685
00:50:42.373 --> 00:50:43.499
I was focusing on...

686
00:50:43.583 --> 00:50:45.376
One that their family will accept
at the funeral.

687
00:50:46.377 --> 00:50:47.337
None, sir.

688
00:50:48.296 --> 00:50:51.341
Why didn't you anticipate the turn?
You were briefed on the terrain.

689
00:50:51.966 --> 00:50:54.677
Don't tell me. Tell it to his family.

690
00:51:00.099 --> 00:51:02.644
Hangman, ease up.
The canyon's getting tighter.

691
00:51:02.727 --> 00:51:05.313
Negative, Payback. Increase your speed.

692
00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:10.276
- You're going too fast, man.
- No harm in being ahead of schedule.

693
00:51:12.487 --> 00:51:15.448
Damn it, slow down!
I can't stay on the course!

694
00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:18.117
You're gonna hit the wall!
Watch out! Watch out!

695
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:24.540
- What happened?
- I flew as fast as I could.

696
00:51:25.124 --> 00:51:26.709
Kind of like my ass depended on it.

697
00:51:26.793 --> 00:51:30.004
And you put your team in danger,
and your wingman's dead.

698
00:51:31.214 --> 00:51:32.757
They couldn't keep up.

699
00:51:38.888 --> 00:51:41.516
Rooster,
we're 20 seconds behind and dropping.

700
00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:44.185
We're fine. Speed is good.

701
00:51:44.269 --> 00:51:45.812
Increase to 500 knots.

702
00:51:45.895 --> 00:51:48.940
- Negative, Yale. Hold your speed.
- Rooster, we're late!

703
00:51:49.023 --> 00:51:51.818
We're alive.
We'll make up time in the straightaway.

704
00:51:51.901 --> 00:51:53.486
We are not gonna make it.

705
00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:56.572
Just trust me. Maintain your speed.
We can make it.

706
00:51:56.656 --> 00:51:57.782
Why are you dead?

707
00:51:59.117 --> 00:52:03.079
You're team leader up there.
Why are you, why is your team dead?

708
00:52:03.162 --> 00:52:05.832
Sir, he's the only one
who made it to the target.

709
00:52:05.915 --> 00:52:07.125
A minute late.

710
00:52:07.917 --> 00:52:10.503
He gave enemy aircraft time
to shoot him down.

711
00:52:10.586 --> 00:52:12.422
- He is dead.
- You don't know that.

712
00:52:12.505 --> 00:52:16.009
You're not flying fast enough.
You don't have a second to waste.

713
00:52:16.092 --> 00:52:17.343
We made it to the target.

714
00:52:17.427 --> 00:52:21.139
And superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out.

715
00:52:21.222 --> 00:52:24.225
- Then it's a dogfight.
- Against fifth-generation fighters.

716
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:26.894
- Yeah. We'd still have a chance.
- In an F-18.

717
00:52:26.978 --> 00:52:29.480
It's not the plane, sir, it's the pilot.

718
00:52:29.564 --> 00:52:30.690
Exactly!

719
00:52:37.822 --> 00:52:40.491
There's more than one way
to fly this mission.

720
00:52:40.575 --> 00:52:42.535
You really don't get it.

721
00:52:43.536 --> 00:52:46.205
On this mission,
a man flies like Maverick here,

722
00:52:46.289 --> 00:52:48.124
or a man does not come back.

723
00:52:49.125 --> 00:52:51.210
No offense intended.

724
00:52:51.294 --> 00:52:53.588
Yet somehow you always manage.

725
00:52:55.131 --> 00:52:57.925
Look, I don't mean to criticize.
You're conservative, that's all.

726
00:52:58.009 --> 00:52:58.843
Lieutenant.

727
00:52:58.926 --> 00:53:03.514
We're going into combat, son,
on a level no living pilot's ever seen.

728
00:53:05.058 --> 00:53:06.184
Not even him.

729
00:53:08.186 --> 00:53:10.021
That's no time to be thinking
about the past.

730
00:53:14.108 --> 00:53:16.152
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Rooster.

731
00:53:16.235 --> 00:53:18.821
I can't be the only one that knows
that Maverick flew with his old man.

732
00:53:18.905 --> 00:53:20.365
- That's enough.
- Or that Maverick was flying

733
00:53:20.448 --> 00:53:22.158
- when his old man...
- Lieutenant, that's enough!

734
00:53:24.118 --> 00:53:25.995
- That's enough.
- You son of a bitch!

735
00:53:26.079 --> 00:53:27.038
Hey, come on!

736
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:29.624
I'm cool, I'm cool. Hey, hey, hey.

737
00:53:29.707 --> 00:53:30.541
That's enough.

738
00:53:30.625 --> 00:53:32.710
- He's not cut out for this mission.
- That's enough!

739
00:53:32.794 --> 00:53:34.045
You know it.

740
00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:38.091
You know I'm right.

741
00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:45.681
You're all dismissed.

742
00:54:49.996 --> 00:54:51.372
Maverick.

743
00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:55.001
It's come back?

744
00:54:55.668 --> 00:54:57.128
No one knows.

745
00:54:59.297 --> 00:55:01.007
There's nothing else they can do.

746
00:55:01.883 --> 00:55:04.886
Even speaking is painful now.

747
00:55:10.892 --> 00:55:12.602
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

748
00:55:32.288 --> 00:55:33.289
Admiral.

749
00:55:44.842 --> 00:55:46.052
How's my wingman?

750
00:55:57.688 --> 00:55:59.982
Please, don't worry about me.

751
00:56:00.942 --> 00:56:02.693
What can I do for you?

752
00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.245
All right.

753
00:56:15.081 --> 00:56:18.209
Well, Rooster's still angry with me
about what I did.

754
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.463
I thought eventually
he would understand why.

755
00:56:24.715 --> 00:56:26.384
I hoped he'd forgive me.

756
00:56:34.809 --> 00:56:36.727
The mission is less than three weeks away.

757
00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:38.896
The kid's not ready.

758
00:56:47.238 --> 00:56:49.198
He doesn't want what I have to give.

759
00:56:50.408 --> 00:56:51.659
Ice, please,

760
00:56:51.742 --> 00:56:54.078
don't ask me to send someone else to die.

761
00:56:54.161 --> 00:56:55.288
Please don't...

762
00:56:56.289 --> 00:56:57.873
Don't ask me to send him.

763
00:56:57.957 --> 00:56:59.542
Send me.

764
00:57:31.324 --> 00:57:32.992
I don't know how.

765
00:57:46.213 --> 00:57:47.965
I'm not a teacher, Ice.

766
00:57:50.384 --> 00:57:52.219
I'm a fighter pilot.

767
00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:56.223
A naval aviator.

768
00:57:58.726 --> 00:58:00.811
It's not what I am.

769
00:58:02.063 --> 00:58:03.648
It's who I am.

770
00:58:05.399 --> 00:58:07.151
How do I teach that?

771
00:58:09.028 --> 00:58:11.656
Even if I could teach it,
it's not what Rooster wants.

772
00:58:12.615 --> 00:58:14.784
It's not what the navy wants.

773
00:58:14.867 --> 00:58:17.203
That's why they canned me the last time.

774
00:58:20.039 --> 00:58:23.000
The only reason I'm here is you.

775
00:58:30.341 --> 00:58:32.176
If I send him on this mission,

776
00:58:33.594 --> 00:58:35.471
he might never come home.

777
00:58:39.225 --> 00:58:40.851
And if I don't send him,

778
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.396
he'll never forgive me.

779
00:58:46.107 --> 00:58:48.567
Either way, I could lose him forever.

780
00:58:59.036 --> 00:59:00.037
I know.

781
00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:02.206
I know.

782
00:59:13.384 --> 00:59:17.012
The navy needs Maverick.

783
00:59:19.056 --> 00:59:22.601
The kid needs Maverick.

784
00:59:23.686 --> 00:59:25.896
That's why I fought for you.

785
00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.276
That's why you're still here.

786
00:59:38.325 --> 00:59:40.077
Thank you, Ice,

787
00:59:40.745 --> 00:59:42.163
for everything.

788
00:59:47.084 --> 00:59:48.544
One last thing.

789
00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:50.921
Who's the better pilot?

790
00:59:51.005 --> 00:59:52.298
You or me?

791
00:59:55.426 --> 00:59:58.012
This is a nice moment. Let's not ruin it.

792
01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:40.095
All right, all right.

793
01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.024
Touchdown!

794
01:02:01.677 --> 01:02:02.678
Sir.

795
01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:04.805
- What is this?
- This is dogfight football.

796
01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:07.057
Offense and defense at the same time.

797
01:02:07.892 --> 01:02:08.893
Who's winning?

798
01:02:08.976 --> 01:02:11.896
I think they stopped keeping score
a while ago.

799
01:02:11.979 --> 01:02:15.024
This detachment still has some training
to complete, Captain.

800
01:02:15.107 --> 01:02:17.318
- Every available minute matters.
- Yes, sir.

801
01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:19.612
So why are we out here playing games?

802
01:02:19.695 --> 01:02:21.572
You said to create a team, sir.

803
01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.617
There's your team.

804
01:04:04.008 --> 01:04:06.593
Should I go? Before Amelia gets back?

805
01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:09.013
- She'll be at her friend's house tonight.
- Good.

806
01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:13.851
You and Amelia, you seem...

807
01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:19.023
a lot closer than when I last saw you.

808
01:04:19.106 --> 01:04:21.525
- Yeah. Yeah, we are.
- How do you manage?

809
01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:24.820
Well,

810
01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:29.700
you know, she always wanted more freedom
than I thought she was ready for.

811
01:04:30.451 --> 01:04:32.411
Where'd she get that from, I wonder?

812
01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.458
I guess I realized

813
01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.461
I also had to trust her.

814
01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:44.548
Let her make some
of her own mistakes sometimes.

815
01:04:47.051 --> 01:04:48.719
Not an easy choice.

816
01:04:53.057 --> 01:04:55.059
Is that what happened with Rooster?

817
01:04:58.729 --> 01:05:01.482
I pulled his papers
from the Naval Academy.

818
01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:06.236
Took years off his career.

819
01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:13.535
Why?

820
01:05:16.455 --> 01:05:19.958
His mother never wanted him to fly,
not after what happened to Goose.

821
01:05:22.753 --> 01:05:26.173
She made me promise before she died, so...

822
01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.175
Does Rooster know that?

823
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.765
He will always resent me for what I did.

824
01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:38.769
Why should he resent her too?

825
01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.400
Not an easy choice.

826
01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:50.864
I was trying to be the father he lost.

827
01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:54.952
I just...

828
01:05:57.830 --> 01:05:59.998
I wish I would've done it better.

829
01:06:02.251 --> 01:06:05.087
But the truth is...

830
01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:09.466
I didn't think he was ready.

831
01:06:13.053 --> 01:06:14.763
Is he ready now?

832
01:06:18.225 --> 01:06:19.643
Mom, I'm home!

833
01:06:21.395 --> 01:06:23.814
I thought you were staying
at Karen's tonight.

834
01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:26.650
Karen's sick. And I've got homework to do.

835
01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:29.153
- I should go.
- You should go.

836
01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:32.531
- Have you had dinner yet?
- Not yet. You want to go out?

837
01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:35.576
No, it's okay. I'll make you something.

838
01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:36.743
I'll be down in a sec!

839
01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:39.580
- Wait! Not that way.
- What?

840
01:06:41.248 --> 01:06:43.458
Look, I have an example to set.

841
01:06:43.542 --> 01:06:46.003
I can't be bringing guys home
on a first date.

842
01:06:46.086 --> 01:06:47.421
This is not our first date.

843
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:50.132
You know what I mean.

844
01:06:52.885 --> 01:06:53.886
Okay.

845
01:06:55.053 --> 01:06:56.096
Fine.

846
01:06:57.139 --> 01:06:59.433
But this is the last time
I go out your window.

847
01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:00.976
We'll see.

848
01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:02.477
No. No, I mean it.

849
01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:05.063
I'm never gonna leave you again.

850
01:07:07.149 --> 01:07:08.775
Shut up.

851
01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:10.736
Go on, get out of here.

852
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:26.251
Just don't break her heart again.

853
01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:39.181
Good morning.

854
01:07:39.431 --> 01:07:41.433
The uranium enrichment plant
that is your target

855
01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:43.977
will be operational earlier than expected.

856
01:07:44.061 --> 01:07:47.189
Raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days' time.

857
01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:50.984
As a result, your mission
has been moved up one week

858
01:07:51.068 --> 01:07:54.696
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation.

859
01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.616
Sir, no one here has successfully flown
a low-level course.

860
01:07:57.699 --> 01:07:59.618
Nevertheless,
you've been ordered to move on.

861
01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:01.828
Captain.

862
01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:07.251
We have one week left
to focus on phase two.

863
01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:09.211
It's the most difficult stage
of the mission.

864
01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:11.088
It's a pop-up strike with a steep dive,

865
01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:14.091
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles.

866
01:08:15.259 --> 01:08:18.428
Two pairs of F-18s will fly
in a welded wing formation.

867
01:08:18.512 --> 01:08:19.763
Teamwork.

868
01:08:19.846 --> 01:08:22.349
Precise coordination of these aircraft
is essential

869
01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:25.143
to both the mission's success
and your survival.

870
01:08:25.227 --> 01:08:27.938
As you know,
the plant rests between two mountains.

871
01:08:28.021 --> 01:08:32.109
On final approach,
you'll invert directly into a steep dive.

872
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:35.779
This allows you to maintain
the lowest possible altitude

873
01:08:36.989 --> 01:08:38.782
and the only possible attack angle.

874
01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:46.373
Your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide.

875
01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:50.544
The two-seat aircraft will paint
the target with a laser bull's-eye.

876
01:08:52.004 --> 01:08:53.880
The first pair will breach the reactor

877
01:08:53.964 --> 01:08:57.634
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

878
01:08:57.718 --> 01:08:59.928
This will create an opening
for the second pair.

879
01:09:00.762 --> 01:09:02.222
That's miracle number one.

880
01:09:04.516 --> 01:09:05.976
The second team

881
01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:07.394
will deliver the kill shot

882
01:09:08.729 --> 01:09:10.522
and destroy the target.

883
01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:13.108
That's miracle number two.

884
01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.737
If either team misses the target...

885
01:09:19.031 --> 01:09:19.906
That's a miss.

886
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:21.992
- ...the mission is a failure.
- Damn it!

887
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:26.496
Egress is a steep high-G climb out
to avoid hitting this mountain.

888
01:09:29.374 --> 01:09:32.669
A steep climb at that speed,
you're pulling at least eight G's.

889
01:09:32.753 --> 01:09:34.254
Nine, minimum.

890
01:09:34.338 --> 01:09:37.132
The stress limit
of the F-18's airframe is 7.5.

891
01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:38.592
That's the accepted limit.

892
01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:40.886
To survive this mission,
you'll pull beyond that,

893
01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:43.638
even if it means bending your airframe.

894
01:09:44.973 --> 01:09:48.352
You'll be pulling so hard,
you'll weigh close to 2, 000 pounds,

895
01:09:48.435 --> 01:09:51.313
your skull crushing your spine,

896
01:09:51.396 --> 01:09:54.483
your lungs imploding
like an elephant's sitting on your chest,

897
01:09:54.566 --> 01:09:57.986
fighting with everything you have
just to keep from blacking out.

898
01:10:00.072 --> 01:10:02.574
And this is where you'll be
at your most vulnerable.

899
01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:06.411
This is Coffin Corner.

900
01:10:06.495 --> 01:10:09.247
Assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain,

901
01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:12.918
you'll climb straight up into enemy radar
while losing all of your airspeed.

902
01:10:13.502 --> 01:10:16.129
Within seconds,
you'll be fired upon by enemy SAMs.

903
01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:19.841
You've all faced sustained G's before,
but this...

904
01:10:20.592 --> 01:10:24.262
This is gonna take you and your aircraft
to the breaking point.

905
01:10:24.346 --> 01:10:27.099
Sir, is this even achievable?

906
01:10:27.182 --> 01:10:28.850
The answer to that question

907
01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:31.436
will come down to the pilot in the box.

908
01:10:41.363 --> 01:10:43.615
- Talk to me, Bob.
- We are 12 seconds late on target.

909
01:10:43.698 --> 01:10:46.410
- We got to move! We got to move!
- Copy. Try to stay with me.

910
01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:51.623
Wait, who's that?

911
01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.292
Blue Team, you've been spotted.

912
01:10:54.376 --> 01:10:57.003
- Shit, it's Maverick.
- What the hell is he doing here?

913
01:10:57.087 --> 01:11:00.215
I'm a bandit on course to intercept.
Blue Team, what are you gonna do?

914
01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:03.510
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock.
700 knots closure.

915
01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:05.429
Your call. What do you want to do?

916
01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:08.223
Continue. We're close. Stay on target.

917
01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:11.518
- He's swinging around to the north!
- Stand by for pop-up.

918
01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.687
- Be ready on that laser, Bob.
- Copy. I'm on it.

919
01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:17.649
Blue Team, bandit is still closing.

920
01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:18.900
Popping now.

921
01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:27.200
Talk to me, Bob. Where's Maverick?

922
01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:29.327
He's five miles out. He's coming fast.

923
01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.711
- Target's in sight.
- Where's my laser, Bob?

924
01:11:38.545 --> 01:11:41.923
Deadeye! Deadeye! It's no good.
Sorry, I can't get a lock.

925
01:11:42.007 --> 01:11:43.842
We're out of time. I'm dropping blind.

926
01:11:47.095 --> 01:11:48.513
Damn it, missed!

927
01:12:00.108 --> 01:12:02.277
- That's tone.
- Maverick's got missile lock on us.

928
01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.403
Shit! We're dead.

929
01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:06.990
Blue Team, that's a fail.
Level out, Coyote.

930
01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:11.578
Coyote? Do you copy?

931
01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:15.874
Coyote, come in.

932
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.418
Coyote, level wings.

933
01:12:18.502 --> 01:12:20.086
God. He's in G-LOC.

934
01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:23.381
Coyote? Coyote?

935
01:12:23.465 --> 01:12:25.675
- He's gonna burn in!
- I'm going after him.

936
01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:31.681
Come on.
Give me tone, give me tone, give me tone.

937
01:12:32.224 --> 01:12:34.643
Snap out of it, Coyote. Come on! Come on!

938
01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:40.440
Come on, Coyote, come on. Come on!

939
01:12:40.524 --> 01:12:42.692
- Damn it! Coyote!
- Pull up!

940
01:12:42.776 --> 01:12:45.403
- Coyote! Coyote!
- Pull up! Pull up!

941
01:12:50.617 --> 01:12:52.410
Coyote, you okay?

942
01:12:53.453 --> 01:12:55.205
I'm okay. I'm good.

943
01:12:56.206 --> 01:12:59.042
Good. Good. That's enough for today.

944
01:13:01.253 --> 01:13:02.462
That was close.

945
01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:03.964
Too close.

946
01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:07.008
Bird strike! Bird strike!

947
01:13:07.092 --> 01:13:08.218
Bird strike!

948
01:13:11.555 --> 01:13:14.224
- Phoenix, left engine's on fire!
- Climbing.

949
01:13:16.226 --> 01:13:18.728
Throttling back.
Shutting off fuel to left engine.

950
01:13:18.812 --> 01:13:20.438
Extinguishing fire.

951
01:13:22.816 --> 01:13:23.817
Right engine is out!

952
01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.569
It's still spinning. Trying to restart it.

953
01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:30.699
- Phoenix, it's on fire. Don't start it.
- Throttling up.

954
01:13:32.284 --> 01:13:33.535
My God.

955
01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:39.332
- We're on fire! We're on fire!
- Damn it!

956
01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:42.168
- Engine fire. Right.
- Extinguishing right engine.

957
01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:47.382
Phoenix, Bob, punch out, punch out!

958
01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:49.676
Warning lights everywhere!
Hydraulic failure!

959
01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.469
- Flight controls.
- I can't control it.

960
01:13:51.553 --> 01:13:54.306
We're going down, Phoenix!
We're going in! We're going in!

961
01:13:54.389 --> 01:13:57.017
You can't save it. Eject, eject!

962
01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.268
Eject, eject, eject!

963
01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:01.187
Altitude. Altitude.

964
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:25.712
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob
in the hospital overnight for observation.

965
01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:27.297
They're gonna be okay.

966
01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:32.719
That's good.

967
01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:37.807
I've never lost a wingman.

968
01:14:38.558 --> 01:14:39.768
You're lucky.

969
01:14:40.352 --> 01:14:42.187
Fly long enough, it'll happen.

970
01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:46.650
There will be others.

971
01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:51.404
Easy for you to say. No wife.

972
01:14:53.365 --> 01:14:54.574
No kids.

973
01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:57.911
Nobody to mourn you when you burn in.

974
01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:02.499
Go home.

975
01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:05.085
Just get some sleep.

976
01:15:07.629 --> 01:15:09.839
Why'd you pull my papers at the Academy?

977
01:15:09.923 --> 01:15:11.549
Why did you stand in my way?

978
01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:15.470
You weren't ready.

979
01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:16.846
Ready for what?

980
01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:20.308
- Ready to fly like you?
- No.

981
01:15:20.392 --> 01:15:22.018
Ready to forget the book.

982
01:15:22.102 --> 01:15:24.813
Trust your instincts.
Don't think, just do.

983
01:15:24.896 --> 01:15:27.565
You think up there, you're dead.
Believe me.

984
01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:30.527
My dad believed in you.

985
01:15:33.238 --> 01:15:35.699
I'm not gonna make the same mistake.

986
01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:42.872
Maverick.

987
01:15:53.425 --> 01:15:56.302
Ready, aim, fire.

988
01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.225
Ready,

989
01:16:02.726 --> 01:16:03.768
aim,

990
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:05.645
fire.

991
01:16:15.697 --> 01:16:16.906
Ready,

992
01:16:17.949 --> 01:16:19.325
aim,

993
01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:20.702
fire.

994
01:16:54.486 --> 01:16:56.654
I can only imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

995
01:16:57.739 --> 01:16:59.991
Take some time. Whatever you need.

996
01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:03.620
I appreciate that, sir,
but there is no time. The mission...

997
01:17:03.703 --> 01:17:05.789
I'll be taking over the training
from here.

998
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:07.791
Sir?

999
01:17:09.209 --> 01:17:11.002
We both know you didn't want this job,
Captain.

1000
01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:13.421
- Sir, they're not ready.
- It was your job to get them ready.

1001
01:17:13.505 --> 01:17:16.966
Sir, they have to believe
that this mission can be flown.

1002
01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:19.803
And all you've managed to do
is teach them that it can't.

1003
01:17:20.637 --> 01:17:22.972
- Sir...
- You're grounded, Captain.

1004
01:17:23.056 --> 01:17:24.557
Permanently.

1005
01:17:28.436 --> 01:17:29.729
- Sir...
- That is all.

1006
01:17:48.248 --> 01:17:49.249
I heard.

1007
01:17:51.543 --> 01:17:52.710
I'm sorry.

1008
01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:55.255
What are you gonna do?

1009
01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:57.715
Ice is gone.

1010
01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.970
What choice do I have?

1011
01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:05.765
You'll have to find a way back
on your own.

1012
01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:07.100
No, Penny.

1013
01:18:08.893 --> 01:18:10.228
I'm out.

1014
01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:13.231
This is over.

1015
01:18:13.773 --> 01:18:14.774
Pete.

1016
01:18:14.858 --> 01:18:17.318
If you lost your wingman up there,

1017
01:18:18.069 --> 01:18:19.779
you'd keep fighting.

1018
01:18:19.863 --> 01:18:21.155
You wouldn't just give up.

1019
01:18:21.948 --> 01:18:23.908
Those are your pilots.

1020
01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:27.370
If anything happens to them,

1021
01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.248
you'll never forgive yourself.

1022
01:18:34.294 --> 01:18:36.170
I don't know what to do.

1023
01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:41.759
But you'll find a way.

1024
01:18:44.178 --> 01:18:45.388
I know you will.

1025
01:18:47.557 --> 01:18:49.934
Captain Mitchell
is no longer your instructor.

1026
01:18:50.018 --> 01:18:52.437
And as of today,
there are new mission parameters.

1027
01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:55.064
Time to target is now four minutes.

1028
01:18:55.815 --> 01:18:58.359
You'll be entering the valley level
at reduced speed.

1029
01:18:58.443 --> 01:19:01.404
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1030
01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:04.282
Sir, won't we be giving their planes
time to intercept?

1031
01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:06.868
Well, Lieutenant, you have
a fighting chance against enemy aircraft.

1032
01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:10.038
What are the odds of surviving
a head-on collision with a mountain?

1033
01:19:10.121 --> 01:19:12.707
You'll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude,

1034
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:14.000
level with the north wall.

1035
01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:16.502
Gonna be a little harder
to keep your lase on target,

1036
01:19:16.586 --> 01:19:18.504
but you will avoid the high-G climb out.

1037
01:19:18.588 --> 01:19:20.798
We'll be sitting ducks for enemy missiles.

1038
01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.472
Who the hell is that?

1039
01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:32.101
Maverick to Range Control.
Entering Point Alpha.

1040
01:19:32.185 --> 01:19:33.853
Confirm green range.

1041
01:19:34.479 --> 01:19:36.814
Maverick, Range Control,

1042
01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:38.524
green range is confirmed.

1043
01:19:38.608 --> 01:19:41.986
I don't see an event scheduled
for you, sir.

1044
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:43.279
Well, I'm going anyway.

1045
01:19:43.947 --> 01:19:45.198
Nice.

1046
01:19:45.949 --> 01:19:48.993
Setting time to target:
Two minutes, 15 seconds.

1047
01:19:49.077 --> 01:19:50.828
2:15? That's impossible.

1048
01:19:50.912 --> 01:19:53.456
Final attack point. Maverick's inbound.

1049
01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:34.348
Popping in three, two, one.

1050
01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.210
Bombs away.

1051
01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.604
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!

1052
01:22:22.897 --> 01:22:24.482
Yes.

1053
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.486
Damn.

1054
01:22:41.249 --> 01:22:43.459
You have put me
in a difficult position, Captain.

1055
01:22:44.377 --> 01:22:48.131
On the one hand, you have demonstrated
that this mission can be flown.

1056
01:22:48.214 --> 01:22:50.299
Perhaps the only way it can be survived.

1057
01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:53.427
On the other hand,

1058
01:22:53.511 --> 01:22:56.430
you did it by stealing
a multimillion-dollar military aircraft

1059
01:22:56.514 --> 01:22:59.392
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again.

1060
01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:03.104
Iceman is no longer here to protect you.

1061
01:23:03.938 --> 01:23:06.566
I have everything I need
to have you court-martialed

1062
01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:08.401
and dishonorably discharged.

1063
01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:10.570
So what do I do?

1064
01:23:11.571 --> 01:23:14.699
Risk the lives of my pilots
and perhaps the success of this mission

1065
01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.201
or...

1066
01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:20.204
risk my career

1067
01:23:21.289 --> 01:23:23.040
by appointing you team leader?

1068
01:23:26.377 --> 01:23:27.378
Sir...

1069
01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:31.090
I think the admiral's asking
a rhetorical question, Captain.

1070
01:25:11.941 --> 01:25:13.526
Talk to me, Goose.

1071
01:25:16.862 --> 01:25:18.364
Captain Mitchell!

1072
01:25:25.329 --> 01:25:26.998
You're where you belong.

1073
01:25:31.919 --> 01:25:33.421
Make us proud.

1074
01:25:59.530 --> 01:26:01.657
It has been an honor flying with you.

1075
01:26:02.742 --> 01:26:06.203
Each one of you represents
the best of the best.

1076
01:26:06.996 --> 01:26:09.707
This is a very specific mission.

1077
01:26:10.541 --> 01:26:13.836
My choice is a reflection of that
and nothing more.

1078
01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:15.755
Choose your two Foxtrot teams.

1079
01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.966
Payback and Fanboy.

1080
01:26:20.051 --> 01:26:21.385
Phoenix and Bob.

1081
01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:26.974
And your wingman.

1082
01:26:31.771 --> 01:26:32.772
Rooster.

1083
01:26:37.318 --> 01:26:39.612
The rest of you will stand by
on the carrier

1084
01:26:39.695 --> 01:26:42.573
for any reserve role that's required.

1085
01:26:43.449 --> 01:26:44.617
Dismissed.

1086
01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:55.252
Your target is a clear and present threat.

1087
01:26:56.754 --> 01:27:00.591
A secret uranium enrichment site
under rogue state control.

1088
01:27:01.217 --> 01:27:02.593
It's an underground bunker,

1089
01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:04.470
tucked between these two mountains.

1090
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:09.725
Your route of ingress is heavily defended
by surface-to-air missiles

1091
01:27:09.809 --> 01:27:12.311
backed up by fifth-generation fighters.

1092
01:27:12.395 --> 01:27:15.147
Once your F-18 strike team
crosses the border,

1093
01:27:15.231 --> 01:27:17.233
Tomahawk missiles from the USS Leyte Gulf

1094
01:27:17.316 --> 01:27:20.945
will launch a synchronized strike
on the enemy's airfield here.

1095
01:27:22.238 --> 01:27:24.448
This will knock out their runway.

1096
01:27:26.242 --> 01:27:29.620
But you'll have to contend with
any planes already in the air.

1097
01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:32.540
The moment those Tomahawks hit,
the enemy will know you're coming.

1098
01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:37.795
Your time to target
will be two minutes and 30 seconds.

1099
01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:41.465
Any longer than that,
and you will be exposed

1100
01:27:41.549 --> 01:27:44.176
to any aircraft
the Tomahawks may have missed.

1101
01:27:47.555 --> 01:27:49.974
This is what you've all been training for.

1102
01:27:51.934 --> 01:27:53.436
Come home safely.

1103
01:28:08.117 --> 01:28:09.869
You give 'em hell!

1104
01:28:22.506 --> 01:28:23.507
Sir.

1105
01:28:24.008 --> 01:28:25.009
Sir?

1106
01:28:27.261 --> 01:28:28.262
I...

1107
01:28:31.182 --> 01:28:32.808
I just want to say...

1108
01:28:41.901 --> 01:28:43.235
We'll talk

1109
01:28:44.737 --> 01:28:46.113
when we get back.

1110
01:28:52.203 --> 01:28:53.996
Hey, Bradley! Bradley!

1111
01:28:55.122 --> 01:28:56.123
Hey.

1112
01:28:59.627 --> 01:29:01.045
You got this.

1113
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:10.471
Maverick.

1114
01:29:12.723 --> 01:29:13.557
Maverick?

1115
01:29:15.518 --> 01:29:17.436
Hey, you with me?

1116
01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:20.856
I don't like that look, Mav.

1117
01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:25.194
It's the only one I got.

1118
01:29:29.823 --> 01:29:31.158
Thank you.

1119
01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:34.745
If I don't see you again, Hondo,

1120
01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:36.163
thank you.

1121
01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:45.756
It's been an honor, Captain.

1122
01:30:18.914 --> 01:30:21.959
Dagger One, up and ready on Catapult One.

1123
01:30:22.042 --> 01:30:24.169
Dagger Spare standing by.

1124
01:30:24.253 --> 01:30:26.046
Dagger Four, up and ready.

1125
01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:27.631
Dagger Three, up and ready.

1126
01:30:27.715 --> 01:30:29.842
Dagger Two, up and ready.

1127
01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:33.679
Support assets airborne.
Strike package ready.

1128
01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:35.639
Standing by for launch decision.

1129
01:30:36.265 --> 01:30:37.266
Send them.

1130
01:30:57.911 --> 01:30:59.204
Dagger Two away.

1131
01:31:00.205 --> 01:31:02.166
Dagger Three away.

1132
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:04.168
Dagger Four away.

1133
01:31:15.179 --> 01:31:17.598
Comanche, Dagger One. Standby check in.

1134
01:31:18.974 --> 01:31:20.434
Comanche 11, set.

1135
01:31:20.517 --> 01:31:22.770
Picture clean. Recommend Dagger continue.

1136
01:31:22.853 --> 01:31:24.813
Copy. Daggers descending below radar.

1137
01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:47.378
Daggers now below radar.
Switching to E-2 picture.

1138
01:31:55.886 --> 01:31:58.472
Here we go. Enemy territory up ahead.

1139
01:31:58.555 --> 01:32:01.517
Feet dry in 60 seconds.
Comanche, Dagger One. Picture.

1140
01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:04.395
Comanche. Picture clean.
Decision is yours.

1141
01:32:04.478 --> 01:32:05.771
Copy.

1142
01:32:14.071 --> 01:32:15.197
Dagger attack.

1143
01:32:20.494 --> 01:32:21.787
Tomahawks airborne.

1144
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:23.956
No turning back now.

1145
01:32:29.712 --> 01:32:31.755
Daggers, assume attack formation.

1146
01:32:40.848 --> 01:32:42.808
Daggers set. Proceeding to target.

1147
01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:47.438
Two minutes and 30 seconds
in three, two, one, mark.

1148
01:32:47.521 --> 01:32:48.856
- Two mark.
- Three mark.

1149
01:32:48.939 --> 01:32:49.815
Four mark.

1150
01:32:54.778 --> 01:32:55.696
Going in.

1151
01:33:11.336 --> 01:33:13.547
First SAM site overhead.

1152
01:33:17.926 --> 01:33:19.428
Looks like we're clear on radar, Mav.

1153
01:33:19.511 --> 01:33:21.263
Let's not take it for granted.

1154
01:33:24.767 --> 01:33:26.977
More SAMs! Three o'clock high!

1155
01:33:29.313 --> 01:33:31.690
- We got two minutes to target.
- Copy.

1156
01:33:31.774 --> 01:33:34.109
We're a few seconds behind, Rooster.
We got to move.

1157
01:33:35.652 --> 01:33:38.530
Thirty seconds to Tomahawk impact
on enemy airstrip.

1158
01:33:46.914 --> 01:33:47.915
Dagger, Comanche.

1159
01:33:47.998 --> 01:33:50.167
We're picking up two bandits.
Single group, two contacts.

1160
01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:53.003
- Where the hell'd they come from?
- Long-range patrol?

1161
01:33:58.008 --> 01:33:59.468
Comanche, what's their heading?

1162
01:33:59.551 --> 01:34:02.054
Bull's-eye 090, 50, tacked southwest.

1163
01:34:02.137 --> 01:34:04.223
They're headed away from us.
They don't know we're here.

1164
01:34:04.306 --> 01:34:06.266
The second those Tomahawks
hit the air base,

1165
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:08.519
those bandits are gonna move
to defend the target.

1166
01:34:08.602 --> 01:34:11.188
We have to get there before they do.
Increase speed.

1167
01:34:12.564 --> 01:34:14.858
We got you, Mav. Don't wait for me.

1168
01:34:20.823 --> 01:34:23.826
Sir, Daggers Two and Four
are behind schedule.

1169
01:34:23.909 --> 01:34:25.911
Time to target, one minute 20.

1170
01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.289
Tomahawk impact in three, two...

1171
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:36.129
Impact. Enemy runway is destroyed.

1172
01:34:36.922 --> 01:34:38.590
They know we're coming now.

1173
01:34:41.969 --> 01:34:44.304
Bandits are switching course
to defend the target.

1174
01:34:44.388 --> 01:34:45.514
Rooster, where are you?

1175
01:34:47.224 --> 01:34:48.976
Come on, Rooster. Bandits inbound.

1176
01:34:49.059 --> 01:34:51.228
We got to make up time now.
Let's turn and burn.

1177
01:34:59.194 --> 01:35:00.237
Heads up, Phoenix.

1178
01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:14.418
Sir, bandits are two minutes from target.
Daggers are one minute from target.

1179
01:35:14.501 --> 01:35:16.795
Come on, Rooster. Move it or lose it.

1180
01:35:19.047 --> 01:35:21.884
Guys, we're falling behind.
We really got to move.

1181
01:35:21.967 --> 01:35:23.760
If we don't increase our speed right now,

1182
01:35:23.844 --> 01:35:26.638
those bandits are gonna be waiting for us
when we reach the target.

1183
01:35:28.432 --> 01:35:29.641
Talk to me, Dad.

1184
01:35:30.976 --> 01:35:32.477
Come on, kid, you can do it.

1185
01:35:32.561 --> 01:35:34.605
Don't think, just do.

1186
01:35:43.113 --> 01:35:44.573
Jesus, Rooster, not that fast!

1187
01:35:44.656 --> 01:35:47.200
That's it, kid, that's it.
All right, let's go.

1188
01:35:51.288 --> 01:35:53.040
Damn, Rooster, take it easy.

1189
01:35:53.707 --> 01:35:56.335
Sir, Dagger Two is reengaging.

1190
01:35:56.418 --> 01:35:58.795
All right, now hit your target
and come home.

1191
01:36:03.216 --> 01:36:05.928
Thirty seconds to target.
Bob, check your laser.

1192
01:36:06.011 --> 01:36:09.514
Air-to-ground check complete.
Laser code verified, 1688.

1193
01:36:09.598 --> 01:36:10.682
Laser is a go!

1194
01:36:13.018 --> 01:36:14.394
Watch your heads.

1195
01:36:16.146 --> 01:36:17.606
Holy shit!

1196
01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:19.608
- Payback, you with me?
- Right behind you.

1197
01:36:20.692 --> 01:36:22.527
Phoenix, stand by for pop-up strike.

1198
01:36:22.611 --> 01:36:23.946
Dagger Three in position.

1199
01:36:24.613 --> 01:36:27.282
Popping in three, two, one.

1200
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:57.562
- Get me eyes on that target, Bob.
- Dagger Three.

1201
01:36:58.438 --> 01:36:59.731
Stand by, Mav.

1202
01:36:59.815 --> 01:37:02.234
- Come on, Bob, come on.
- Stand by.

1203
01:37:02.818 --> 01:37:05.570
- I've got it. Captured!
- Target acquired. Bombs away.

1204
01:37:26.633 --> 01:37:30.012
We've got impact!
Check, direct hit! Direct hit!

1205
01:37:30.095 --> 01:37:31.930
That's miracle number one.

1206
01:37:32.597 --> 01:37:34.016
Dagger Two, status.

1207
01:37:34.099 --> 01:37:35.600
Almost there, Mav. Almost there.

1208
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:39.855
Fanboy, where's my laser?

1209
01:37:40.439 --> 01:37:42.566
Rooster, there's something wrong
with this laser.

1210
01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:44.276
Shit! Deadeye, deadeye, deadeye!

1211
01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:46.695
Come on, guys, we're running out of time.
Get it online!

1212
01:37:46.778 --> 01:37:48.238
- I'm trying!
- Come on, Fanboy!

1213
01:37:48.321 --> 01:37:49.990
Nearly there! Nearly there!

1214
01:37:58.874 --> 01:38:01.460
- Come on, Fanboy, get it online.
- There's no time. I'm dropping blind.

1215
01:38:01.543 --> 01:38:03.754
- Rooster, I got this!
- No time. Pull up.

1216
01:38:03.837 --> 01:38:05.213
- Wait!
- Bombs away! Bombs away!

1217
01:38:18.769 --> 01:38:20.604
Bull's-eye, bull's-eye, bull's-eye!

1218
01:38:24.566 --> 01:38:25.859
Miracle number two.

1219
01:38:25.942 --> 01:38:27.569
Now they're in Coffin Corner.

1220
01:38:27.652 --> 01:38:29.738
We're not out of this yet.

1221
01:38:31.573 --> 01:38:32.991
Here it comes.

1222
01:38:36.036 --> 01:38:38.205
Radar warning! Smoke in the air.
Phoenix, break right.

1223
01:38:38.288 --> 01:38:40.582
Emergency jettison.
Dagger Three defending.

1224
01:38:40.665 --> 01:38:42.459
Here comes another one!

1225
01:38:42.542 --> 01:38:44.211
Dagger One defending.

1226
01:38:50.509 --> 01:38:51.593
Rooster, status.

1227
01:38:59.810 --> 01:39:00.811
My God.

1228
01:39:03.021 --> 01:39:04.439
Smoke in the air!

1229
01:39:05.816 --> 01:39:07.692
- Break right, Payback!
- Breaking right.

1230
01:39:09.111 --> 01:39:10.946
My God, here they come!

1231
01:39:11.029 --> 01:39:12.405
SAM on your six, Rooster!

1232
01:39:13.865 --> 01:39:15.242
Deploying countermeasures.

1233
01:39:18.078 --> 01:39:19.579
Negative contact.

1234
01:39:21.623 --> 01:39:22.707
Dagger One defending.

1235
01:39:24.126 --> 01:39:27.003
- Talk to me, Bob.
- Break right, Phoenix! Break right! Mav!

1236
01:39:27.087 --> 01:39:28.588
Nine o'clock! Nine o'clock!

1237
01:39:29.422 --> 01:39:31.383
Rooster, two more on your six.

1238
01:39:31.466 --> 01:39:32.926
Dagger Two, defending.

1239
01:39:37.514 --> 01:39:39.850
- Payback, SAM on your nose.
- Dagger Four defending.

1240
01:39:39.933 --> 01:39:41.518
- Rooster, tally, seven o'clock!
- Talk to me, Bob!

1241
01:39:41.601 --> 01:39:42.936
- On our six!
- Dagger Two defending.

1242
01:39:43.019 --> 01:39:44.688
- Phoenix, break right!
- I see it!

1243
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:53.446
Dagger Two defending.

1244
01:39:54.823 --> 01:39:55.991
Shit, I'm out of flares!

1245
01:39:56.074 --> 01:39:58.410
Rooster, evade, evade!

1246
01:39:58.493 --> 01:40:00.745
I can't shake 'em!
They're on me! They're on me!

1247
01:40:10.881 --> 01:40:12.507
Mav! No!

1248
01:40:14.509 --> 01:40:18.013
Dagger One is hit!
I repeat, Dagger One is hit!

1249
01:40:18.096 --> 01:40:19.598
Maverick is down.

1250
01:40:19.681 --> 01:40:20.849
Dagger One, status.

1251
01:40:20.932 --> 01:40:22.559
Status!

1252
01:40:22.642 --> 01:40:24.769
Anyone see him? Does anyone see him?

1253
01:40:24.853 --> 01:40:27.105
- Dagger One, come in!
- I didn't see a parachute.

1254
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:28.815
We have to circle back.

1255
01:40:28.899 --> 01:40:31.401
Comanche. Bandits inbound.
Single group, hot.

1256
01:40:31.484 --> 01:40:32.986
Recommend Dagger flow south.

1257
01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:35.822
One minute to intercept.

1258
01:40:39.075 --> 01:40:40.660
Get 'em back to the carrier now.

1259
01:40:40.744 --> 01:40:43.246
All Daggers flow to ECP.
You have bandits headed for you.

1260
01:40:43.330 --> 01:40:44.372
What about Maverick?

1261
01:40:44.456 --> 01:40:47.459
Tell him there's nothing he can do
for Maverick, not in a goddamn F-18.

1262
01:40:47.542 --> 01:40:50.378
Dagger Spare request permission
to launch and fly air cover.

1263
01:40:52.672 --> 01:40:53.673
Negative, Spare.

1264
01:40:54.841 --> 01:40:57.385
- Launch search and rescue.
- Negative. Not with bandits in the air.

1265
01:40:57.469 --> 01:41:01.014
- But, sir, Maverick is still out there.
- We are not losing anyone else today.

1266
01:41:02.974 --> 01:41:04.476
Get 'em home now.

1267
01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:07.103
Dagger, you are not to engage.

1268
01:41:07.187 --> 01:41:09.272
Repeat, do not engage.

1269
01:41:09.356 --> 01:41:12.442
Dagger Two, return to carrier.
Acknowledge.

1270
01:41:12.525 --> 01:41:13.526
Acknowledge.

1271
01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:17.072
Rooster, those bandits are closing.
We can't go back.

1272
01:41:17.155 --> 01:41:20.033
Rooster, he's gone.

1273
01:41:21.701 --> 01:41:23.203
Maverick's gone.

1274
01:42:53.668 --> 01:42:54.669
No, no.

1275
01:43:01.426 --> 01:43:02.886
Dagger Two is hit.

1276
01:43:04.054 --> 01:43:05.138
Dagger Two is hit.

1277
01:43:06.723 --> 01:43:08.099
Dagger Two, come in.

1278
01:43:09.809 --> 01:43:11.644
Dagger Two, do you copy?

1279
01:43:12.312 --> 01:43:14.606
Dagger Two, come in.

1280
01:43:39.881 --> 01:43:41.091
You all right?

1281
01:43:41.174 --> 01:43:42.759
Yeah, I'm good. You all right?

1282
01:43:45.345 --> 01:43:46.429
What the hell?

1283
01:43:46.513 --> 01:43:48.890
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

1284
01:43:48.973 --> 01:43:51.351
You think I took that missile
so you could be down here with me?

1285
01:43:51.434 --> 01:43:53.269
You should be back on the carrier by now!

1286
01:43:53.353 --> 01:43:55.063
I saved your life!

1287
01:43:55.146 --> 01:43:58.274
I saved your life. That's the whole point.

1288
01:43:58.358 --> 01:44:00.151
What the hell were you even thinking?

1289
01:44:00.235 --> 01:44:02.278
You told me not to think!

1290
01:44:19.003 --> 01:44:20.088
Well,

1291
01:44:21.423 --> 01:44:22.799
it's good to see you.

1292
01:44:25.218 --> 01:44:26.845
It's good to see you too.

1293
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:32.350
So what's the plan?

1294
01:44:43.319 --> 01:44:44.696
You're not serious.

1295
01:45:00.211 --> 01:45:01.838
You've got to be shitting me.

1296
01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:04.883
An F-14?

1297
01:45:05.592 --> 01:45:07.385
I shot down three MiGs in one of those.

1298
01:45:07.469 --> 01:45:09.888
We don't even know
if that bag of ass can fly.

1299
01:45:12.599 --> 01:45:14.559
- Let's find out.
- Mav!

1300
01:45:16.436 --> 01:45:17.437
Okay.

1301
01:45:26.988 --> 01:45:28.990
- There's guys up there, Mav.
- Yeah.

1302
01:45:30.241 --> 01:45:32.160
- There's more over there.
- Okay.

1303
01:45:33.453 --> 01:45:35.622
- Let's start running.
- Yeah, run. Run.

1304
01:45:45.089 --> 01:45:47.467
Once I give you the signal for air,

1305
01:45:48.176 --> 01:45:50.887
you're gonna flip this switch
until the needle gets to 120.

1306
01:45:50.970 --> 01:45:52.138
When the engine starts,

1307
01:45:52.222 --> 01:45:54.724
you got to pull out the pins
and disconnect everything.

1308
01:45:54.807 --> 01:45:56.476
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1309
01:45:58.645 --> 01:45:59.646
Yes!

1310
01:46:01.523 --> 01:46:03.691
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.

1311
01:46:11.616 --> 01:46:13.660
Okay.

1312
01:46:14.827 --> 01:46:16.663
It's been a minute, Mav?

1313
01:46:45.525 --> 01:46:48.486
My God. This thing is so old.

1314
01:46:49.487 --> 01:46:50.488
All right.

1315
01:46:55.577 --> 01:46:57.120
- Canopy?
- Clear.

1316
01:47:15.346 --> 01:47:17.223
Both runways are cratered.

1317
01:47:17.932 --> 01:47:20.018
How we gonna get this museum piece
in the air?

1318
01:47:30.403 --> 01:47:31.821
Why are the wings coming out, Mav?

1319
01:47:38.494 --> 01:47:41.205
Mav, this is a taxiway, not a runway.

1320
01:47:41.789 --> 01:47:44.709
This is a very short taxiway, Mav.

1321
01:47:44.792 --> 01:47:46.002
Just hang on.

1322
01:47:47.337 --> 01:47:48.713
Holy shit!

1323
01:47:54.761 --> 01:47:56.054
Come on, come on, come on.

1324
01:47:56.137 --> 01:47:57.180
Needle's alive.

1325
01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:02.852
- Mav?
- That's it. Come on, come on!

1326
01:48:02.935 --> 01:48:03.978
All right.

1327
01:48:04.896 --> 01:48:06.898
- Mav!
- Here we go.

1328
01:48:08.358 --> 01:48:09.776
Holy shit.

1329
01:48:23.539 --> 01:48:26.626
Sir, we're receiving a signal
from Rooster's ESAT.

1330
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:28.628
But there seems to be a malfunction.

1331
01:48:28.711 --> 01:48:30.046
- Have you lost him?
- No, sir.

1332
01:48:31.047 --> 01:48:32.507
He's supersonic.

1333
01:48:33.132 --> 01:48:34.217
He's airborne.

1334
01:48:35.468 --> 01:48:37.053
- In what?
- Sir.

1335
01:48:37.762 --> 01:48:42.016
Overwatch reports an F-14 Tomcat is
airborne and on course for our position.

1336
01:48:42.934 --> 01:48:45.478
Can't be. It can't be!

1337
01:48:47.146 --> 01:48:48.147
Maverick.

1338
01:48:50.441 --> 01:48:52.777
Okay, Rooster,
get us in touch with the boat.

1339
01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:54.320
I'm working on it.

1340
01:48:54.404 --> 01:48:57.824
Radio's out. No radar.
Everything's dead back here.

1341
01:48:58.491 --> 01:49:00.868
- What do I do? Talk me through it.
- Okay, first the radio.

1342
01:49:00.952 --> 01:49:02.120
Throw the...

1343
01:49:02.954 --> 01:49:05.164
the UHF-2 circuit breaker.

1344
01:49:05.248 --> 01:49:06.249
Try that.

1345
01:49:06.833 --> 01:49:09.293
There's 300 breakers back here.
Anything more specific?

1346
01:49:09.377 --> 01:49:11.337
I don't know.
That was your dad's department.

1347
01:49:11.421 --> 01:49:12.880
I'll figure it out.

1348
01:49:16.217 --> 01:49:18.219
Mav, tally two, five o'clock low.

1349
01:49:23.725 --> 01:49:24.851
What do we do?

1350
01:49:25.518 --> 01:49:27.645
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

1351
01:49:27.729 --> 01:49:29.689
If they knew who we were,
we'd be dead already.

1352
01:49:32.066 --> 01:49:34.026
Well, here they come.

1353
01:49:34.694 --> 01:49:37.196
- What's your plan?
- Just put your mask on.

1354
01:49:38.448 --> 01:49:40.783
Remember, we're on the same team.

1355
01:49:43.494 --> 01:49:45.288
Just wave and smile.

1356
01:49:45.913 --> 01:49:47.540
Just wave and smile.

1357
01:49:54.672 --> 01:49:56.466
What's that signal? What's he saying?

1358
01:49:56.549 --> 01:49:59.427
No idea. I have no idea what he's saying.

1359
01:50:00.303 --> 01:50:03.681
- What about that one? Any idea?
- No, never seen that one either.

1360
01:50:07.018 --> 01:50:10.855
Shit. His wingman is moving
into weapons envelope.

1361
01:50:11.647 --> 01:50:13.191
All right, listen up.

1362
01:50:13.274 --> 01:50:15.985
When I tell you,
you grab those rings above your head.

1363
01:50:16.068 --> 01:50:17.653
That's the ejection handle.

1364
01:50:18.738 --> 01:50:20.907
Mav, can we outrun these guys?

1365
01:50:21.574 --> 01:50:23.284
Not their missiles and guns.

1366
01:50:28.289 --> 01:50:29.665
Then it's a dogfight.

1367
01:50:30.374 --> 01:50:33.211
An F-14 against fifth-gen fighters?

1368
01:50:34.754 --> 01:50:36.964
It's not the plane, it's the pilot.

1369
01:50:38.549 --> 01:50:40.510
You'd go after 'em if I wasn't here.

1370
01:50:41.177 --> 01:50:42.845
But you are here.

1371
01:50:43.638 --> 01:50:44.972
Come on, Mav.

1372
01:50:46.098 --> 01:50:47.266
Don't think.

1373
01:50:48.559 --> 01:50:49.602
Just do.

1374
01:51:05.243 --> 01:51:07.203
Tell me when you see smoke in the air.

1375
01:51:11.582 --> 01:51:13.668
- Smoke in the air! Smoke in the air!
- Hang on.

1376
01:51:16.504 --> 01:51:19.006
Yeah, Mav! Splash one! Splash one!

1377
01:51:24.345 --> 01:51:25.555
Here comes another one.

1378
01:51:28.808 --> 01:51:30.852
Rooster, flares! Now, now, now!

1379
01:51:34.272 --> 01:51:35.523
Splitting the throttles.

1380
01:51:37.692 --> 01:51:38.818
Coming around.

1381
01:51:43.155 --> 01:51:45.616
- Give me tone, give me tone.
- You got him, Mav! You got him!

1382
01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:46.617
Taking the shot.

1383
01:51:53.291 --> 01:51:54.542
What the...

1384
01:51:55.543 --> 01:51:57.670
Holy shit! What the fuck was that?

1385
01:51:59.088 --> 01:52:01.340
Hang on. We got to get low.

1386
01:52:01.424 --> 01:52:03.718
The terrain will confuse
his targeting system.

1387
01:52:05.845 --> 01:52:06.762
Here he comes!

1388
01:52:19.567 --> 01:52:21.485
Talk to me, Rooster. Where is he?

1389
01:52:21.569 --> 01:52:23.237
He's still on us!

1390
01:52:30.411 --> 01:52:32.496
- We took a hit! We took a hit!
- Damn it!

1391
01:52:37.585 --> 01:52:40.004
- Come on, Mav. Do some of that pilot shit.
- Brace yourself.

1392
01:52:50.473 --> 01:52:51.515
Holy shit.

1393
01:52:58.564 --> 01:53:00.399
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1394
01:53:04.862 --> 01:53:06.113
Damn it!

1395
01:53:07.114 --> 01:53:09.367
Out of missiles. Switching to guns.

1396
01:53:15.706 --> 01:53:16.832
Come on, Mav, come on.

1397
01:53:19.502 --> 01:53:21.128
- You got him, Mav!
- It's not over yet.

1398
01:53:25.841 --> 01:53:27.677
- One last chance.
- You can do this.

1399
01:53:28.844 --> 01:53:30.054
Come on, Maverick.

1400
01:53:40.147 --> 01:53:42.066
Yes! Splash two!

1401
01:53:53.119 --> 01:53:55.037
- Mav, I got the radio on.
- Outstanding.

1402
01:53:55.121 --> 01:53:57.081
- Get us in touch with the boat.
- Copy that.

1403
01:53:59.291 --> 01:54:00.501
My God.

1404
01:54:02.503 --> 01:54:04.171
Where the hell is this guy?

1405
01:54:05.506 --> 01:54:07.091
He's on our nose.

1406
01:54:10.511 --> 01:54:11.721
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

1407
01:54:13.848 --> 01:54:16.183
Smoke in the air! Rooster, flares!

1408
01:54:18.728 --> 01:54:20.021
That was close.

1409
01:54:22.481 --> 01:54:24.400
We're out of flares, Mav.

1410
01:54:28.612 --> 01:54:30.573
Shit, he's already on us.

1411
01:54:35.411 --> 01:54:37.121
This is not good.

1412
01:54:45.296 --> 01:54:47.256
- We took another hit!
- No, no, no!

1413
01:54:52.053 --> 01:54:54.346
We can't take much more of this.

1414
01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:56.182
We can't outrun this guy. We got to eject.

1415
01:54:56.265 --> 01:54:57.516
- What?
- We need altitude.

1416
01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.310
Pull the ejection handles
the second I tell you.

1417
01:54:59.393 --> 01:55:01.854
- Mav, wait!
- Rooster, there's no other way.

1418
01:55:05.107 --> 01:55:06.692
Eject, eject, eject!

1419
01:55:07.526 --> 01:55:09.570
Rooster, pull the handle! Eject!

1420
01:55:09.653 --> 01:55:11.238
It's not working.

1421
01:55:21.916 --> 01:55:23.250
Mav!

1422
01:55:25.586 --> 01:55:26.921
I'm sorry.

1423
01:55:28.422 --> 01:55:29.924
I'm sorry, Goose.

1424
01:55:42.645 --> 01:55:46.649
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your savior speaking.

1425
01:55:46.732 --> 01:55:48.275
Please fasten your seat belts,

1426
01:55:48.359 --> 01:55:51.403
return your tray tables
to their locked and upright positions

1427
01:55:52.363 --> 01:55:54.615
and prepare for landing.

1428
01:55:56.951 --> 01:55:59.203
Hey, Hangman, you look good.

1429
01:55:59.286 --> 01:56:02.623
I am good, Rooster. I'm very good.

1430
01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.210
I'll see you back on deck.

1431
01:56:28.107 --> 01:56:29.567
Maverick is downwind.

1432
01:56:29.650 --> 01:56:33.112
No front landing gear. No tailhook.
Pull the cable and raise the barricade.

1433
01:56:33.195 --> 01:56:35.281
Foul deck! Raise the barricade!

1434
01:56:36.365 --> 01:56:37.741
Go!

1435
01:57:00.264 --> 01:57:02.391
Please don't tell me we lost an engine.

1436
01:57:02.474 --> 01:57:05.102
- All right, I won't tell you that.
- Okay.

1437
01:57:28.876 --> 01:57:29.793
You good?

1438
01:57:30.544 --> 01:57:32.213
Yeah. I'm good.

1439
01:58:17.883 --> 01:58:20.386
- Chalked yourself another kill.
- That makes two.

1440
01:58:21.136 --> 01:58:23.931
Mav has five. Makes him an ace.

1441
01:58:42.157 --> 01:58:44.326
Captain Mitchell! Captain Mitchell!

1442
01:58:51.166 --> 01:58:52.418
Sir.

1443
01:59:00.009 --> 01:59:01.635
Thank you for saving my life.

1444
01:59:03.053 --> 01:59:04.930
It's what my dad would've done.

1445
01:59:44.178 --> 01:59:45.179
Hey, Mav.

1446
01:59:46.263 --> 01:59:47.348
Jimmy.

1447
01:59:48.557 --> 01:59:49.558
Is...

1448
01:59:50.476 --> 01:59:51.977
Is Penny around?

1449
01:59:52.061 --> 01:59:55.314
She took Amelia on a sailing trip.

1450
01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:00.152
Did she say when she'd be back?

1451
02:00:00.235 --> 02:00:01.737
You know, she didn't.

1452
02:00:04.073 --> 02:00:05.741
Can I get you anything?

1453
02:00:19.171 --> 02:00:20.089
Get in there.
