(GRUNTING)

171
00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:30.798
That's enough of the dance.

172
00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:32.966
Oh, this is nice! This is really nice!

173
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.719
This is too nice.
There's something crooked going on.

174
00:10:35.803 --> 00:10:37.012

175
00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.972
- Congressman!
- Hey, Marty!

176
00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:40.474
- Nice sound to that.
- I like it.

177
00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:41.558
Here they are!

178

179
00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:43.811

You remember Sarah, Allen, Michael.

181
00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:48.398
I don't think you know the new kid
Eugene Tennanbaum. I found him at G.W.

182
00:10:48.482 --> 00:10:50.150
Sort of a walking search engine. Watch this.

183
00:10:50.234 --> 00:10:52.486
- How many stars on the flag in 1818?
- 15.

184
00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:54.488
And Congressman Baxter's coffee habits?

185
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.825
He likes a morning latte with a cruller,
a decaf espresso after lunch,

186
00:10:57.908 --> 00:10:59.493
served sans pastry of any kind.

187
00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:02.246
Very impressive.
A little freaky, but I like this kid.

188
00:11:02.538 --> 00:11:03.914
(LAUGHING) I love you.

189
00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:09.753
I mean, we should hang out socially.
I just got a ping-pong table.

190

Everybody else, back to your holes.

192
00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:17.803
- EUGENE: He was actually right.
- I'm doing a background check on that kid.

193
00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:22.558
Ta-da! This, my friend, is a power office,
to remind you of the mission!

194
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:24.059
BOTH: "Change the world!"

195
00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:25.853
- Okay, Evan, who do you know?
- What do you mean?

196
00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:27.855
Oh, come on.
Yesterday we're in the basement.

197
00:11:27.938 --> 00:11:29.857
Today, look at this place.
It's like the Emerald City!

198
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.193
"Enjoy your office.
Your neighbor, Congressman Long."

199
00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:35.362
Congressman Long did this?
Did you say "neighbor"?

200
00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:38.282
That's right. He lives in Prestige Crest,
right up the street.

201
00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:42.327
Evan, you got to tell me these things.
Think of the publicity angle on this!

202
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:44.705
You and Congressman Long having
a barbecue.

203
00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:46.665
Congressman Long eating your hot dog.

204
00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.458
RITA: Hate to break up
your little weenie roast.

205
00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:51.211
Congressman Long's assistant
just dropped this off.

206
00:11:51.295 --> 00:11:52.671
The Congressman would like for you

207
00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:54.923
to junior cosponsor this bill
that he's introducing.

208
00:11:55.007 --> 00:11:59.219
Hold on. Congressman Long asked us to
junior cosponsor his bill? What's the bill?

209
00:11:59.303 --> 00:12:01.972
The Citizens' Integration
of Public Lands Act.

210
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.057
Never heard of it. Gene, here, now.

211
00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:06.393
- Rita, why didn't you tell me about this?
- I just did.

212
00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.312
You need to tell me about it
before I need to know about it.

213
00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:10.522
- Marty, you are not the vice congressman.
- I am the legislative...

214
00:12:10.606 --> 00:12:14.234
Nobody voted for you. If Evan gets shot
in the head, you do not automatically...

215
00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:16.320
If Evan got shot in the head,
you're the first suspect.

Play nice. Play nice.

217
00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:19.615
All right, Eugene, Congressman Long's bill.
What is it?

218
00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:22.576
HR71 24, better known as CINPLAN.

219
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:25.329
The bill would open up fringe areas
of the national parks for development.

220
00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:26.914
Long's been sitting on it for ages...

221
00:12:26.997 --> 00:12:28.957
Got it. Pause. Come on, Evan, this is huge.

222
00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:30.542
You hitch your wagon to the right star,

223
00:12:30.626 --> 00:12:32.753
you could ride all the way down
to Pennsylvania Avenue.

224
00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:34.171
This is day one.

225
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.423
You got your name on a major piece
of legislation!

226
00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:39.343
And another thing,
he wants you to read it today.

227
00:12:39.635 --> 00:12:41.136
Well, I can't do it today.

228

- I promised my kids...
- Eugene.

229
00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.431
Well, sir, there's a time clock on the bill.

230
00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.600
If Congressman Long wants to pass it
this quarter,

231
00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:48.810
he's going to have to introduce it
to the committee immediately.

232
00:12:48.894 --> 00:12:51.396
I'm personally going with
whatever Congressman Baxter decides,

233
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.441
because if I could be like one man,
it'd be him.

234
00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:55.859
Either him or Kareem.

235
00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:58.195
- Can I tase him?
- Gene! Heel!

236
00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.696
It'd probably be you.

237
00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.450

- Did you fall in a mine shaft?
- No.

- Did you just come out of a coma?
- No.

No, I wasn't.

719
00:40:49.197 --> 00:40:52.159
Well, if you were going for that rugged look,
you overshot it.

720
00:40:52.242 --> 00:40:53.785
You look like a bum in a suit.

721

I'll be with you in just one...

- Take it in. Take it in.

728
00:41:10.886 --> 00:41:12.638
Okay, yeah, to answer any questions
you may have,

729
00:41:12.721 --> 00:41:14.806
I am going through adult puberty!

730
00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.309
This is all temporary.
Why did you bring me down here?

- What was so important?
- What is so important?

732
00:41:20.354 --> 00:41:22.939
I've got a letter of intent here

You remember that, don't you?

734
00:41:24.107 --> 00:41:27.152
Well, you haven't been here and now
he wants you to sign this in person, Evan!

735
00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:29.488
No, I can't do that. Nope, nope, nope.
Not gonna happen.

736
00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:32.532
No. You can't do that.
Not looking like that. You have to go shave!

737
00:41:32.616 --> 00:41:34.826
I can't shave, Marty.
When I shave, it grows back out.

738
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.871
That happens when you shave!
But then you shave again!

739
00:41:37.954 --> 00:41:39.539
You have no idea.

00:41:48.423 --> 00:41:50.175

Guys, I can't let Long see me
this way, okay?

746
00:41:58.225 --> 00:42:01.937
You're gonna have to tell him I'm sick.

I need your face back. I need you back.

750
00:42:09.611 --> 00:42:11.196
Can you at least tell me
what you're building?

751
00:42:11.279 --> 00:42:13.240
- I'm building a boat.
- You're building a boat?

We all play hooky from time to time.

756
00:42:23.583 --> 00:42:27.421
I'm not gonna turn you in to the principal.
Mostly because I am the principal.

What's with the veil?
Did you get your new set of braces?

No, no. No. That's hilarious, though.

761
00:42:35.846 --> 00:42:39.516
Would you drop that thing, son?
I can't understand a word you're saying.

762
00:42:48.191 --> 00:42:50.068
It's a wife thing, sir.

Just trying to spice up the love life.

764
00:42:52.863 --> 00:42:55.240
She's a big Loggins and Messina fan.

00:42:57.701 --> 00:43:00.370
Would you excuse us for a moment?

767
00:43:00.454 --> 00:43:03.540
The Congressman and I are going
to have a little chat.

768
00:43:06.835 --> 00:43:08.003
Come on.

769
00:43:08.086 --> 00:43:10.255
Nice, isn't it? Politics is dog-eat-dog,

770
00:43:10.338 --> 00:43:12.966
but if you survive, they give you
a bigger den. Have a seat.

771
00:43:13.049 --> 00:43:17.095
So, tell me, Congressman,
are you freaking out on me or what?

772
00:43:17.179 --> 00:43:18.138
No, sir.

773
00:43:18.221 --> 00:43:21.516
Oh, come on, son. I hand you
your first cosponsorship of a bill,

774
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.894
and when you finally show up
you look like the fifth Beatle.

775
00:43:23.977 --> 00:43:26.188
Now, you expect me to believe
everything is hunky dory?

776
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:29.149
Well, sir, actually, things have been
a little more dory.

777
00:43:29.232 --> 00:43:33.403
Of course they are. I get it.
You know anything about animals, son?

778
00:43:34.613 --> 00:43:38.200
The Argentine lake duck has a penis
as long as its body.

779
00:43:39.701 --> 00:43:43.538
Although you probably already know that.
Or have heard it. Not experienced it.

780
00:43:43.622 --> 00:43:46.750
- You ever heard of the Arctic white wolf?
- No, sir.

781
00:43:46.833 --> 00:43:47.959
Top of the food chain.

782
00:43:48.043 --> 00:43:50.670
It's fast, it's smart, can fend for itself,
but it chooses not to.

783
00:43:50.754 --> 00:43:52.339
It chooses to run with a pack.

784
00:43:52.422 --> 00:43:54.549
- And do you know why?
- No.

785
00:43:54.633 --> 00:43:57.177
The Arctic white wolf,
Congressman, realizes

786
00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.012
that it is stronger as part of a group.

787
00:43:59.095 --> 00:44:02.015
Do you know what happens when one of
these wolves decides to fend for itself?

788
00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:04.893
The pack kills the loner
for the greater good of the community.

789
00:44:04.976 --> 00:44:06.645
Ouch, that hurts.

790
00:44:06.728 --> 00:44:09.981
Are you familiar with Jim Jenkins,
the junior congressman from Tennessee?

791
00:44:10.065 --> 00:44:13.485
When I met Congressman Jenkins,
he was fresh off the turnip truck,

792
00:44:13.568 --> 00:44:15.487
but now he's sitting on his own committee.

793
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:18.907
Congressman Jenkins, Congressman
Whitehall, Congressman Freeman,

794
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.536
they all have committee chairs
because they all run with the pack.

795
00:44:22.619 --> 00:44:24.871
Now, you have to come to a decision.

796
00:44:24.955 --> 00:44:27.165
Are you gonna run with the pack
or are you gonna lone wolf it?

797
00:44:27.249 --> 00:44:29.417
I am a pack man, sir.

798
00:44:29.501 --> 00:44:33.588
Good. I'm introducing the CINPLAN bill
in 2 weeks. C-SPAN is covering it live.

01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:00.656
- How about some sandwiches?
- Okay.

1333
01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:03.617
- Who wants sandwiches? Let's do it!
- RYAN: I get first dibs!

1334
01:26:03.701 --> 01:26:05.995
Everyone but Buster
is going to get a sandwich.

1335
01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:10.458
You do not get a sandwich! You're a dog
and you do not get a sandwich!

1336
01:26:10.541 --> 01:26:13.753
Buster is part of the family now.
You're just gonna have to get used to it.

1337
01:26:13.836 --> 01:26:15.671
Poor Buster!

1338
01:26:16.422 --> 01:26:19.508
Honey, come here.
Sweetheart, be careful. Come here.

1339
01:26:19.592 --> 01:26:21.510
- Hey, hon, save me one, okay?
- Okay.

1340
01:26:21.594 --> 01:26:23.346
I'll be right back.

1341
01:26:31.354 --> 01:26:32.730
- Hey.
- Hey.

1342
01:26:34.607 --> 01:26:36.567
What are you doing here?

1343
01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:39.278
Just hanging out with some old friends.

1344
01:26:39.362 --> 01:26:42.656
You knew all along, didn't you?
You knew the dam was unstable.

1345
01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.577
If it hadn't been for the ark,
my family, the neighbors...

1346
01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:50.456
- I fought you every step of the way.
- Yes, but you did it.

1347
01:26:51.457 --> 01:26:56.003
So, you had nothing to do with the flood?
Like where the ark landed exactly?

1348
01:26:56.087 --> 01:26:59.548
I gave you a little shove at the end. Sue me.

You did good, son. You changed the world.

1351
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:08.599
- No, no, I didn't.
- Well, let's see.

1352
01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:12.770
Spending time with your family,
making them very happy.

1353
01:27:12.853 --> 01:27:16.148
- Gave that dog a home.
- Right. So?

1354
01:27:16.816 --> 01:27:18.526
So?

1355
01:27:18.609 --> 01:27:20.736
How do we change the world?

1356
01:27:22.321 --> 01:27:25.741
One act of random kindness at a time.

1357
01:27:25.825 --> 01:27:30.371
One act of random kindness.

1358
01:27:35.501 --> 01:27:36.836
It's time.

1359
01:27:38.879 --> 01:27:40.381
Do the dance.

1360
01:27:41.841 --> 01:27:43.509
Care to join me?
