(GRUNTING)

171
00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:31.799
That's enough of the dance.

172
00:10:31.882 --> 00:10:33.967
Oh, this is nice! This is really nice!

173
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:36.720
This is too nice.
There's something crooked going on.

174
00:10:36.804 --> 00:10:38.013
Do you smell anthrax?

175
00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:39.973
- Congressman!
- Hey, Marty!

176
00:10:40.057 --> 00:10:41.475
- Nice sound to that.
- I like it.

177
00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:42.559
Here they are!

178
00:10:42.643 --> 00:10:43.644
(ALL CHEERING)

179
00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:44.812
All right.

180
00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:46.647
You remember Sarah, Allen, Michael.

181
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.459
I don't think you know the new kid
Eugene Tennanbaum. I found him at G.W.

182
00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:51.211
Sort of a walking search engine.
Watch this.

183
00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:53.487
- How many stars on the flag in 1818?
- 15.

184
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.489
And Congressman Baxter's coffee habits?

185
00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:58.826
He likes a morning latte with a cruller,
a decaf espresso after lunch,

186
00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:00.494
served sans pastry of any kind.

187
00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:03.247
Very impressive.
A little freaky, but I like this kid.

188
00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:04.915
(LAUGHING) I love you.

189
00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:10.754
I mean, we should hang out socially.
I just got a ping-pong table.

190
00:11:10.838 --> 00:11:12.506

191
00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:15.843
Go find out where his license plates are.
Everybody else, back to your holes.

192
00:11:15.926 --> 00:11:18.863
- EUGENE: He was actually right.
- I'm doing a background check on that kid.

193
00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:23.559
Ta-da! This, my friend, is a power office,
to remind you of the mission!

194
00:11:23.642 --> 00:11:25.060
BOTH: "Change the world!"

195
00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:26.913
- Okay, Evan, who do you know?
- What do you mean?

196
00:11:26.937 --> 00:11:28.856
Oh, come on.
Yesterday we're in the basement.

197
00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:30.917
Today, look at this place.
It's like the Emerald City!

198
00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:34.194
"Enjoy your office.
Your neighbor, Congressman Long."

199
00:11:34.278 --> 00:11:36.363
Congressman Long did this?
Did you say "neighbor"?

200
00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:39.283
That's right. He lives in Prestige Crest,
right up the street.

201
00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:43.328
Evan, you got to tell me these things.
Think of the publicity angle on this!

202
00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:45.706
You and Congressman Long having
a barbecue.

203
00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.666
Congressman Long eating your hot dog.

204
00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.519
RITA: Hate to break up
your little weenie roast.

205
00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:52.212
Congressman Long's assistant
just dropped this off.

206
00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:53.672
The Congressman would like for you

207
00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.924
to junior cosponsor this bill
that he's introducing.

208
00:11:56.008 --> 00:12:00.220
Hold on. Congressman Long asked us to
junior cosponsor his bill? What's the bill?

209
00:12:00.304 --> 00:12:02.973
The Citizens' Integration
of Public Lands Act.

210
00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.058
Never heard of it. Gene, here, now.

211
00:12:05.142 --> 00:12:07.394
- Rita, why didn't you tell me about this?
- I just did.

212
00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.372
You need to tell me about it
before I need to know about it.

213
00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:11.583
- Marty, you are not the vice congressman.
- I am the legislative...

214
00:12:11.607 --> 00:12:15.235
Nobody voted for you. If Evan gets shot
in the head, you do not automatically...

215
00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:17.380
If Evan got shot in the head,
you're the first suspect.

Play nice. Play nice.

217
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.675
All right, Eugene, Congressman Long's bill.
What is it?

218
00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:23.577
HR7124, better known as CINPLAN.

219
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.389
The bill would open up fringe areas
of the national parks for development.

220
00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:27.915
Long's been sitting on it for ages...

221
00:12:27.998 --> 00:12:29.958
Got it. Pause. Come on, Evan, this is huge.

222
00:12:30.042 --> 00:12:31.602
You hitch your wagon to the right star,

223
00:12:31.627 --> 00:12:33.787
you could ride all the way down
to Pennsylvania Avenue.

224
00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:35.172
This is day one.

225
00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.424
You got your name on a major piece
of legislation!

226
00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:40.344
And another thing,
he wants you to read it today.

227
00:12:40.636 --> 00:12:42.137
Well, I can't do it today.

228
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.364
- I promised my kids...
- Eugene.

229
00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.432
Well, sir, there's a
time clock on the bill.

230
00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.601
If Congressman Long wants to pass it
this quarter,

231
00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:49.871
he's going to have to introduce it
to the committee immediately.

232
00:12:49.895 --> 00:12:52.397
I'm personally going with
whatever Congressman Baxter decides,

233
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:55.442
because if I could be like one man,
it'd be him.

234
00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:56.860
Either him or Kareem.

235
00:12:56.944 --> 00:12:59.196
- Can I tase him?
- Gene! Heel!

236
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.697
It'd probably be you.

237
00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:04.451
Come on, Evan, this is it!
This is why we came here!

- Did you fall in a mine shaft?
- No.

No, I wasn't.

Well, if you were going for that rugged look,
you overshot it.

720

- Take it in. Take it in.

Okay, yeah, to answer any questions

729
00:41:13.722 --> 00:41:15.807
I am going through adult puberty!

- What is so important?

Well, you haven't been here and now
he wants you to sign this in person, Evan!

No, I can't do that. Nope, nope, nope.
Not gonna happen.

736
00:41:30.572 --> 00:41:33.533
No. You can't do that.
Not looking like that. You have to go shave!

737
00:41:33.617 --> 00:41:35.827
I can't shave, Marty.
When I shave, it grows back out.

738

That happens when you shave!
But then you shave again!

Can you at least tell me
what you're building?

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.241
- I'm building a boat.
- You're building a boat?

No, no. No. That's hilarious, though.

761
00:42:36.847 --> 00:42:40.517
Would you drop that thing, son?
I can't understand a word you're saying.

762

It's a wife thing, sir.

Would you excuse us for a moment?

767
00:43:01.455 --> 00:43:04.541
The Congressman and I are going
to have a little chat.

768
00:43:07.836 --> 00:43:09.004
Come on.

769
00:43:09.087 --> 00:43:11.256
Nice, isn't it? Politics is dog-eat-dog,

770

but if you survive, they give you
a bigger den. Have a seat.

771
00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:18.096
So, tell me, Congressman,
are you freaking out on me or what?

772
00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.180
No, sir.

773
00:43:19.222 --> 00:43:22.517
Oh, come on, son. I hand you
your first cosponsorship of a bill,

774
00:43:22.601 --> 00:43:24.954
and when you finally show up
you look like the fifth Beatle.

775
00:43:24.978 --> 00:43:27.189
Now, you expect me to believe
everything is hunky dory?

776
00:43:27.272 --> 00:43:30.150
Well, sir, actually, things have been
a little more dory.

777
00:43:30.233 --> 00:43:34.404
Of course they are. I get it.
You know anything about animals, son?

778
00:43:35.614 --> 00:43:39.201
The Argentine lake duck has a penis
as long as its body.

779
00:43:40.702 --> 00:43:44.539
Although you probably already know that.
Or have heard it. Not experienced it.

780
00:43:44.623 --> 00:43:47.751
- You ever heard of the Arctic white wolf?
- No, sir.

781
00:43:47.834 --> 00:43:48.960
Top of the food chain.

782
00:43:49.044 --> 00:43:51.671
It's fast, it's smart, can fend for itself,
but it chooses not to.

783
00:43:51.755 --> 00:43:53.340
It chooses to run with a pack.

784
00:43:53.423 --> 00:43:55.550
- And do you know why?
- No.

785
00:43:55.634 --> 00:43:58.178
The Arctic white wolf,
Congressman, realizes

786
00:43:58.261 --> 00:44:00.013
that it is stronger as part of a group.

787
00:44:00.096 --> 00:44:03.075
Do you know what happens when one of
these wolves decides to fend for itself?

788
00:44:03.099 --> 00:44:05.894
The pack kills the loner
for the greater good of the community.

789
00:44:05.977 --> 00:44:07.646
Ouch, that hurts.

790

Are you familiar with Jim Jenkins,
the junior congressman from Tennessee?

791
00:44:11.066 --> 00:44:14.486
When I met Congressman Jenkins,
he was fresh off the turnip truck,

792
00:44:14.569 --> 00:44:16.488
but now he's sitting on his own committee.

793
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:19.908
Congressman Jenkins, Congressman
Whitehall, Congressman Freeman,

794
00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:23.537
they all have committee chairs
because they all run with the pack.

795
00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.872
Now, you have to come to a decision.

796
00:44:25.956 --> 00:44:28.226
Are you gonna run with the pack
or are you gonna lone wolf it?

797
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:30.418
I am a pack man, sir.

798
00:44:30.502 --> 00:44:34.589
Good. I'm introducing the CINPLAN bill
in 2 weeks. C-SPAN is covering it live.

Well, five on, five off.
Life is about balance, right?

1332
01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:01.717
- How about some sandwiches?
- Okay.

1333
01:26:01.741 --> 01:26:04.618
- Who wants sandwiches? Let's do it!
- RYAN: I get first dibs!

1334
01:26:04.702 --> 01:26:06.996
Everyone but Buster
is going to get a sandwich.

1335
01:26:07.079 --> 01:26:11.459
You do not get a sandwich! You're a dog
and you do not get a sandwich!

1336
01:26:11.542 --> 01:26:14.754
Buster is part of the family now.
You're just gonna have to get used to it.

1337
01:26:14.837 --> 01:26:16.672
Poor Buster!

1338
01:26:17.423 --> 01:26:20.509
Honey, come here.
Sweetheart, be careful. Come here.

1339
01:26:20.593 --> 01:26:22.511
- Hey, hon, save me one, okay?
- Okay.

1340
01:26:22.595 --> 01:26:24.347
I'll be right back.

1341
01:26:32.355 --> 01:26:33.731
- Hey.
- Hey.

1342
01:26:35.608 --> 01:26:37.568
What are you doing here?

1343
01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:40.279
Just hanging out with some old friends.

1344
01:26:40.363 --> 01:26:43.657
You knew all along, didn't you?
You knew the dam was unstable.

1345
01:26:43.741 --> 01:26:47.578
If it hadn't been for the ark,
my family, the neighbors...

1346
01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:51.457
- I fought you every step of the way.
- Yes, but you did it.

1347
01:26:52.458 --> 01:26:57.004
So, you had nothing to do with the flood?
Like where the ark landed exactly?

1348
01:26:57.088 --> 01:27:00.549
I gave you a little shove at the end.
Sue me.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1350
01:27:03.135 --> 01:27:06.847
You did good, son. You changed the world.

1351
01:27:06.931 --> 01:27:09.600
- No, no, I didn't.
- Well, let's see.

1352
01:27:09.683 --> 01:27:13.771
Spending time with your family,
making them very happy.

1353
01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:17.149
- Gave that dog a home.
- Right. So?

1354
01:27:17.817 --> 01:27:19.527
So?

1355
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:21.737
How do we change the world?

1356
01:27:23.322 --> 01:27:26.742
One act of random kindness at a time.

1357
01:27:26.826 --> 01:27:31.372
One act of random kindness.

1358
01:27:36.502 --> 01:27:37.837
It's time.

1359
01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.382
Do the dance.

1360
01:27:42.842 --> 01:27:44.510
Care to join me?
