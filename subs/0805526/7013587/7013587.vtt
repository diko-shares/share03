00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.576
<i>Blue, 18.</i>

2
00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:48.380
<i>Set. Hit. Hit.</i>

3
00:00:54.722 --> 00:01:00.037
Zach. Zach. Crossbuck
30. Crossbuck 30.

4
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:02.372
Crossbow at 30. Crossbow at 30.

5
00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.423
Ready? Ready.

6
00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:09.946
The Eagles will have to go for it with
just 42 seconds left and no timeouts.

7
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.283
Coach Taylor can get his first winning
season for the Shiloh Christian Academy

8
00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:15.787
if they can pull this play off.

9
00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:19.189
Move it! Set, hit!

10
00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:21.975
Zach Avery pitches
back to Jacob Hall.

11
00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.610
Jacob's going to try to pass it.

12
00:01:23.634 --> 00:01:25.262
He's got Jeremy Johnson
going down the field.

13
00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:27.447
Here come the
Tigers. Throw it, Jacob!

14
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:29.633
Jacob's gonna try
to tuck it and run,

15
00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:32.652
and he's gonna be taken down at the
40-yard line, stopped by Lewis Slaughter.

16
00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:36.156
Jeremy Johnson was
wide open down the field.

17
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.857
If he'd only had a few seconds
more to throw the football,

18
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:40.610
this game might have
had a different outcome.

19
00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:44.748
As it is, the Tigers will take over
now and will no doubt run out the clock,

20
00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:49.119
thus ending Coach Grant Taylor's bid
for his first winning season in six years.

21
00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:54.541
Now he'll have to wait until next
season for that all-elusive winning record.

22
00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:57.098
That's if they let him
come back next year.

23
00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:09.608
Hi. Get 'em, Claire.

24
00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:11.094
Hey, Grant. Come on, y' all.

25
00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:13.819
Quit talking. Let's
go, let's go. Hurry.

26
00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:23.625
What?

27
00:04:31.388 --> 00:04:34.473
What? You gotta be kidding me.

28
00:04:35.643 --> 00:04:38.455
This had better be a joke. No.

29
00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.191
He said he came in this
morning, got his papers.

30
00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:44.977
Wait. A player can't just transfer
to another school to play football.

31
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:46.379
He's gotta make a
change of address.

32
00:04:46.403 --> 00:04:48.904
He did. He's moving
in with his dad.

33
00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:02.012
I can't believe that.

34
00:05:02.036 --> 00:05:03.997
This is the third time
this has happened.

35
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:05.882
Spend three years
pouring into 'em.

36
00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:07.717
What do they do when
they get to their senior year?

37
00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:12.138
They transfer to a
rival school. Why?

38
00:05:12.162 --> 00:05:15.408
Well, 'cause at the end of the
season nobody wants to be on TV

39
00:05:15.432 --> 00:05:18.483
going "We're number six,
baby. We're number six."

40
00:05:19.703 --> 00:05:21.136
Well, you asked.

41
00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.819
Just had to go
there, didn't you?

42
00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.692
Coach, is it true that
Darren switched to Tucker?

43
00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:34.894
We'll talk about it in
a minute. So it's true.

44
00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:38.465
We'll talk about it in
a minute. Huddle up!

45
00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:41.623
Coach, is it true that
Darren transferred to Tucker?

46
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:48.491
I got word this morning that
Darren did transfer to Tucker.

47
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:52.495
There goes the season. The
season'll be whatever we make it.

48
00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.414
Who's gonna take his place? He
scored a third of our points last year.

49
00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:56.988
You let me worry
about that. We're not

50
00:05:57.012 --> 00:05:58.835
starting off the season
as if it's doomsday.

51
00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:01.253
Nobody's
irreplaceable. Darren is.

52
00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:04.440
Darren is not. There's more to a
good football team than a running back.

53
00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:07.377
If anything, this ought to
push you to take up the slack.

54
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:10.179
Stop worrying about Darren.
Get out there and start your drills.

55
00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.381
We got a game to
play this Friday night.

56
00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:13.971
Let's go, Shiloh.
Come on. Let's go.

57
00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:43.580
Why'd you park all
the way out there?

58
00:06:43.604 --> 00:06:45.782
Had to. It died again.

59
00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:47.884
Why don't we get a new battery?

60
00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:49.519
I'll get Brady to help
me tomorrow morning.

61
00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:51.488
I don't wanna
think about it now.

62
00:06:51.512 --> 00:06:54.345
Want me to take a
look at it for you? Stop it.

63
00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:58.878
Oh, sweet...

64
00:06:58.902 --> 00:07:00.847
Grant, I don't know
what that smell is.

65
00:07:00.871 --> 00:07:02.615
I've scrubbed everything I can.

66
00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.749
It's terrible.

67
00:07:03.773 --> 00:07:06.019
I know it is, but
what else can I do?

68
00:07:06.043 --> 00:07:08.087
I don't even know
where it's coming from.

69
00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:10.323
Well, this day stunk.
Why shouldn't my house?

70
00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:11.825
What do you mean?

71
00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:13.793
Darren transferred to Tucker.

72
00:07:13.817 --> 00:07:16.062
What? He did not?

73
00:07:16.086 --> 00:07:19.598
Yep. Came by and got his
papers, didn't even say goodbye.

74
00:07:19.622 --> 00:07:22.001
Why? Why do you think?

75
00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.570
Didn't see a chance
of winning at Shiloh.

76
00:07:24.594 --> 00:07:27.941
But it ain't like Tucker's gonna
guarantee him a scholarship.

77
00:07:27.965 --> 00:07:30.210
Ooh, I bet the
boys are frustrated.

78
00:07:30.234 --> 00:07:31.649
More than you know.

79
00:07:48.535 --> 00:07:51.447
I meant to throw that away.

80
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.150
Did you think you were pregnant?

81
00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:56.352
I don't know. I just
wanna be pregnant so bad

82
00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:59.127
that my mind plays tricks on me.

83
00:08:09.606 --> 00:08:13.366
You know it's been four
years since we started trying?

84
00:08:15.112 --> 00:08:17.672
Would you be opposed to
me going to see a specialist?

85
00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.093
No.

86
00:08:21.117 --> 00:08:23.317
I'd just like to know
what she says.

87
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.922
OK.

88
00:08:29.526 --> 00:08:32.004
I thought we were
having spaghetti tonight.

89
00:08:32.028 --> 00:08:34.073
Stove's not working.

90
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:36.709
You are kidding me.

91
00:08:36.733 --> 00:08:38.978
So we got a leak
in the back room,

92
00:08:39.002 --> 00:08:41.013
the dryer only
works half the time,

93
00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:43.772
the car's dying on us and
now the stove's broken.

94
00:08:44.892 --> 00:08:46.936
That's about right.

95
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.043
No wonder I'm losing my hair.

96
00:08:50.813 --> 00:08:52.463
I love you.

97
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.554
<i>And now your Georgia Sports
Break with Alicia Houston.</i>

98
00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:07.757
The Richland Giants have
started football practice

99
00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:09.959
as the new school
year gets under way.

100
00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:13.896
The team will be defending a
three-year GISA state championship run.

101
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.065
Now they prepare
to fight for a fourth.

102
00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:19.035
I'm here with head coach
Bobby Lee Duke of the Giants.

103
00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.270
Coach Duke, how does
this year look for the team?

104
00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:25.141
Alice, we've grown real
fond of the state title.

105
00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:27.744
We don't see any reason
to give it up this year.

106
00:09:27.768 --> 00:09:29.678
I've got most of my
starters coming back

107
00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:31.647
and I've got a strong bench.

108
00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.816
So I've only got
one thing to say:

109
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.284
get off the tracks,

110
00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:38.221
'cause the freight
train's coming.

111
00:11:04.013 --> 00:11:07.810
I hope that's not a sign of the way the
rest of the season's gonna go, Coach.

112
00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:11.380
Why did he have to
say that? Just let it go.

113
00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:13.115
I hate this car.

114
00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:15.851
Let's find somebody with
jumper cables and let's go home.

115
00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:17.420
It's bad enough you
lose your first game.

116
00:11:17.444 --> 00:11:19.522
Now I can't even
start my own car.

117
00:11:19.546 --> 00:11:22.814
This happens to everybody.
Don't be embarrassed about it.

118
00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:08.437
Grant, I wasn't
that embarrassed.

119
00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:11.741
Then why did you hide?

120
00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:14.010
Why does this house
have to stink so bad?

121
00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:16.474
You'll get used to it
after a couple of hours.

122
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.416
Honey, we gotta do
something about the car.

123
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.419
The only thing it does
faithfully for us is break down.

124
00:12:23.443 --> 00:12:25.320
That's about right.

125
00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:29.625
Would it not be better
just to get a small new car?

126
00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:32.227
You know we can't afford
that. How do other people do it?

127
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:35.414
Other people make
more than 24,000 a year.

128
00:12:35.438 --> 00:12:37.482
You make 6,000.
That takes us to 30.

129
00:12:37.506 --> 00:12:40.169
Enough to help us with
repairs occasionally,

130
00:12:40.193 --> 00:12:42.605
not with a new car payment.

131
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:46.409
Besides, there's other bills
we don't normally have to pay.

132
00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:49.750
Like what? Like my doctor bill.

133
00:12:51.487 --> 00:12:54.666
You saw her today?

134
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.703
What did she say?
She said that I'm fine.

135
00:12:57.727 --> 00:13:01.407
My numbers are normal and she
saw nothing that gave her concern.

136
00:13:02.499 --> 00:13:04.510
That's good.

137
00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:06.662
It doesn't mean the
problem is with you.

138
00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:09.382
What else could it mean?

139
00:13:09.406 --> 00:13:11.434
We just may not have
given it enough time.

140
00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.474
Four years?

141
00:13:15.478 --> 00:13:17.958
Are you still hoping
we'll have a baby?

142
00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:21.693
You know I am.

143
00:13:21.717 --> 00:13:24.147
Me too.

144
00:13:24.171 --> 00:13:28.151
I catch myself thinking
about it more and more.

145
00:13:28.175 --> 00:13:31.526
Don't you wanna know if
something's preventing it?

146
00:13:35.498 --> 00:13:38.010
Are you afraid of
getting checked out?

147
00:13:38.034 --> 00:13:40.913
Yes.

148
00:13:40.937 --> 00:13:45.368
Grant, I'm still
clinging to a hope

149
00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:47.632
that one day we'll
have children.

150
00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:55.311
I imagine 'em
running in this house.

151
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:58.280
I hear 'em playing
in the backyard

152
00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:02.874
or running to our
bed in a thunderstorm.

153
00:14:04.861 --> 00:14:09.675
And I think about
reading 'em stories

154
00:14:09.699 --> 00:14:11.866
and teaching 'em songs.

155
00:14:15.304 --> 00:14:20.185
And I just keep thinking

156
00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:24.456
how can I miss someone so much

157
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.464
that I have never met?

158
00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:33.554
I'll go.

159
00:14:41.698 --> 00:14:43.542
<i>Stanley.</i>

160
00:14:43.566 --> 00:14:47.146
Stanley.

161
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.032
Stanley, do you wanna tell me what
you're doing on the top of my desk?

162
00:14:52.092 --> 00:14:53.369
No.

163
00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:57.239
Do you have any idea how
you got on top of my desk?

164
00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:58.290
No.

165
00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.926
I suggest you get
down immediately.

166
00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:11.254
You two can tell Coach Taylor

167
00:15:11.278 --> 00:15:13.256
that the reason why
you're late for practice today

168
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.558
is because you've
been sitting in detention.

169
00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:17.677
Come on. That was
some serious humor.

170
00:15:17.701 --> 00:15:19.311
I'll get serious
about your humor

171
00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:21.936
when you get serious
about your studies.

172
00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:26.752
55?

173
00:15:26.776 --> 00:15:29.388
Well, if you wanna announce
your grade to the entire class,

174
00:15:29.412 --> 00:15:32.641
you go right ahead.

175
00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:34.716
57.

176
00:15:36.937 --> 00:15:40.749
So basically we got the
toughest schedule we ever had

177
00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:43.185
and less talent
than we ever had.

178
00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:45.504
At least we got Dewey
County on Friday night.

179
00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.456
That'll be a pretty easy win.

180
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.092
I'm concerned it
might be our only win.

181
00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.595
We'll pull three or four out.

182
00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:55.614
That'll give us another
average season.

183
00:15:55.638 --> 00:15:57.866
I'm so sick of average seasons.

184
00:15:59.442 --> 00:16:01.820
I gotta go. Where are you going?

185
00:16:01.844 --> 00:16:04.590
Got a doctor's
appointment. For what?

186
00:16:04.614 --> 00:16:07.059
I have a doctor's
appointment. For what?

187
00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:11.229
Leave the man alone.
He don't have to tell you.

188
00:16:11.253 --> 00:16:12.848
So what's wrong with you, man?

189
00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:15.356
I'll be back in a
couple of hours.

190
00:16:18.345 --> 00:16:21.357
Now look what you did.
You done made him mad.

191
00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:23.793
Me? You're the one
that made him mad.

192
00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:27.496
No, not me. Besides, I
know where he's going.

193
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.664
Where?

194
00:16:28.688 --> 00:16:31.016
He's going to the hair doctor.

195
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.638
The man is going bald. You hadn't
noticed that underdeveloped region?

196
00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:37.373
You're one to talk, Slick.

197
00:16:37.397 --> 00:16:41.260
No, see, when a black man
goes bald, he still looks good.

198
00:16:41.284 --> 00:16:42.478
Look at Michael Jordan,

199
00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:46.248
George Foreman,
Samuel L. Jackson.

200
00:16:46.272 --> 00:16:49.868
Classy-looking brothers.
Who you got? Kojak?

201
00:16:49.892 --> 00:16:53.689
Yeah, Coach gonna
get him some plugs.

202
00:16:53.713 --> 00:16:56.192
Grant would not get plugs.

203
00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:58.611
Don't laugh. You next.

204
00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:16.166
<i>♪ It feels like a
brand-new day ♪</i>

205
00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:22.050
<i>♪ And I know I'm not the same ♪</i>

206
00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:24.553
Your soccer skills get
better every year, son.

207
00:17:24.577 --> 00:17:26.588
It doesn't matter, Dad. Shiloh
doesn't have a soccer team.

208
00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:27.923
They play football.

209
00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:30.943
So? Why not kick
for the football team?

210
00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:33.078
They've already
got a good kicker.

211
00:17:33.102 --> 00:17:35.364
I'm sure they wouldn't mind
having two good kickers.

212
00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.233
Dad, I'm too small.

213
00:17:37.257 --> 00:17:40.152
I really just don't
feel like getting killed.

214
00:17:40.176 --> 00:17:42.287
Are you saying
you're not interested

215
00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:45.124
or you'd like to try
out but you're afraid?

216
00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:47.159
What if I don't even
make the team?

217
00:17:47.183 --> 00:17:50.095
Well, you're already
not on the team.

218
00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:53.415
I mean, you can't get any more not
on the team than you are right now.

219
00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:55.751
OK, Dad.

220
00:17:55.775 --> 00:17:57.253
David, you can't
be afraid of failure.

221
00:17:57.277 --> 00:18:00.222
Everyone fails at some point.

222
00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:03.542
So you think I should try
out for the football team?

223
00:18:03.566 --> 00:18:05.377
Well, if you're waiting
around for soccer,

224
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:07.452
it ain't gonna happen.

225
00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:16.138
Ow!

226
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.441
Coach Owens, have
you got a minute? Yeah.

227
00:18:21.718 --> 00:18:25.764
Look, some of the
men have been talking.

228
00:18:25.788 --> 00:18:29.068
We really wanna see this school
succeed with our football program.

229
00:18:29.092 --> 00:18:31.203
I know you feel
the same way, too.

230
00:18:31.227 --> 00:18:33.405
But, frankly,

231
00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:37.109
we don't ever see that happening
while Coach Taylor is here.

232
00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:39.544
Well, you know we're
in a rebuilding season.

233
00:18:39.568 --> 00:18:41.714
Look, I know he's
a fine man an' all,

234
00:18:41.738 --> 00:18:44.583
but he's had six years here

235
00:18:44.607 --> 00:18:47.720
and nothing significant
to even show for it.

236
00:18:47.744 --> 00:18:50.856
You know, I honestly believe you
would make a better head coach.

237
00:18:58.838 --> 00:19:02.651
Some of us have requested
a meeting with Mr. Ryker.

238
00:19:02.675 --> 00:19:04.653
If you would just support us,

239
00:19:04.677 --> 00:19:08.207
I really believe this
could go a lot easier.

240
00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:10.309
Mr. Pervis, I don't know.

241
00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:12.977
Look, it's not like we're
trying to hurt the guy.

242
00:19:13.001 --> 00:19:16.465
What we're doing is for
the benefit of the school.

243
00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:19.940
You just think about it.

244
00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:24.728
Good hustle, Casey.

245
00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:32.247
What was that about? What?

246
00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:35.039
Alvin Pervis. Oh,
we were just talking.

247
00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:38.887
Everything all right?

248
00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:42.490
Yeah. MAN: Mr. Taylor.

249
00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:43.708
Yes.

250
00:19:43.732 --> 00:19:46.278
I'm Larry Childers.

251
00:19:46.302 --> 00:19:48.647
This is my son
David. He's a junior.

252
00:19:48.671 --> 00:19:50.181
We're new to the
school this year.

253
00:19:50.205 --> 00:19:51.766
Good to meet you.
What can I do for you?

254
00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.551
I just wanted to
introduce myself to you

255
00:19:53.575 --> 00:19:56.288
and David wanted to know if it
was too late to try out for the team.

256
00:19:56.312 --> 00:19:59.391
You a football player? Well,
I've always played soccer

257
00:19:59.415 --> 00:20:01.343
but I figured I could
try out as a kicker.

258
00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:04.446
OK. Well, I've got a pretty good kicker,
but I don't mind letting you try out.

259
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.115
Jonathan, come here.

260
00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:10.752
This is Jonathan. He holds for
our main kicker, Joshua Webster.

261
00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:12.787
Jonathan, this
is David Childers.

262
00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:15.023
He wants to try out as a kicker.

263
00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.248
Why don't you two go
out there and try a few

264
00:20:16.272 --> 00:20:17.525
kicks just to get your
feet wet a little bit?

265
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:20.128
All right, sure. Thank you, sir.

266
00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:22.464
If you don't mind, I'll just
hang around till practice is over.

267
00:20:22.488 --> 00:20:25.283
No problem. Good to meet you.

268
00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:27.369
Y'all just move here?

269
00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:28.771
Yeah, from Athens.

270
00:20:28.795 --> 00:20:31.507
My dad got a job
teaching at the college.

271
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:32.974
That's cool.

272
00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:34.443
I'm used to kicking
soccer balls,

273
00:20:34.467 --> 00:20:37.413
but I thought I
could at least try out.

274
00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:40.549
Josh is a pretty good kicker,
but he's also a receiver.

275
00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:42.384
I think he likes that
better than kicking.

276
00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:45.042
Here you go.

277
00:20:56.205 --> 00:20:58.222
I'm sorry.

278
00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.608
Man, I'm sorry.

279
00:21:03.312 --> 00:21:05.445
I'm sorry.

280
00:21:07.583 --> 00:21:09.594
Ow!

281
00:21:09.618 --> 00:21:11.618
Sorry about
that. It's all right.

282
00:21:17.827 --> 00:21:20.673
Hey, watch it. Sorry.

283
00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:23.375

284
00:21:23.399 --> 00:21:25.978

287
00:21:32.592 --> 00:21:35.271
Matt.

288
00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:37.295
Matt.

289
00:21:39.165 --> 00:21:41.977
Let's go. I'm going with
Brock for a little walk.

290
00:21:42.001 --> 00:21:43.845
Not tonight. You're
coming home. Why?

291
00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:48.132
Don't argue with me. Let's
go. No, Dad. I'll be home later.

292
00:21:48.156 --> 00:21:49.423
Matt.

293
00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:11.590
That old man still come every
week to pray in the hallway?

294
00:22:11.614 --> 00:22:16.478
Mr. Bridges. Prays for the
students as he passes their locker.

295
00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:21.517
How long has he been doing
that? Since before I got here.

296
00:22:21.541 --> 00:22:23.084
Lord knows we need it.

297
00:22:23.108 --> 00:22:26.254
Apathy in the school's as
bad as our football record.

298
00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:27.538
That reminds me.

299
00:22:27.562 --> 00:22:30.347
I think you should let
David Childers on the team.

300
00:22:32.234 --> 00:22:36.398
You see something there? Well,
he's just used to playing soccer.

301
00:22:36.422 --> 00:22:39.223
He ain't that strong,
but he shows promise.

302
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.188
All right. I'll give him a shot.

303
00:22:56.308 --> 00:22:58.308
One, two, hit!

304
00:23:07.286 --> 00:23:10.520
What are you doing?
Let's stay in the game!

305
00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.996
No! No!

306
00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:28.550
Will someone tell me how we
lost to Dewey County 21 to 7?

307
00:23:28.574 --> 00:23:30.519
21 to 7.

308
00:23:30.543 --> 00:23:34.889
Dewey County hasn't beaten
Shiloh since you were in kindergarten.

309
00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:39.995
I don't know what you call that junk
out there, but it sure wasn't football.

310
00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:43.065
Nine dropped passes, four
fumbles, three interceptions.

311
00:23:43.089 --> 00:23:45.784
Their defense scored
most of their points.

312
00:23:45.808 --> 00:23:48.437
You gave the game away.

313
00:23:48.461 --> 00:23:52.523
You can't win football games if
you don't play together as a team.

314
00:23:52.547 --> 00:23:56.712
You can't win when you're more concerned
about what you're doing afterwards.

315
00:23:56.736 --> 00:24:00.720
You can't learn the plays when you
miss practice 'cause you're in detention.

316
00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:05.887
I'm sick of the
apathy on this team.

317
00:24:05.911 --> 00:24:08.911
If we're not here to win football
games, then why are we here?

318
00:24:15.988 --> 00:24:17.549
So, do you agree with him?

319
00:24:17.573 --> 00:24:20.219
I don't know.

320
00:24:20.243 --> 00:24:21.753
I guess.

321
00:24:21.777 --> 00:24:25.390
Only a few guys on the
team really seem to care.

322
00:24:25.414 --> 00:24:27.859
So are you ready
to play in the game?

323
00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:31.313
I don't know why they would use
me when they've got Joshua Webster.

324
00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:34.082
He can kick a
45-yard field goal.

325
00:24:34.106 --> 00:24:35.818
I bet you could too.

326
00:24:35.842 --> 00:24:39.554
Dad, I can barely kick
a 35-yard field goal.

327
00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:42.825
At the end of the game,
kind of glad I didn't play.

328
00:24:42.849 --> 00:24:45.727
That way, I can't mess up.

329
00:24:45.751 --> 00:24:47.129
That's fear, son.

330
00:24:47.153 --> 00:24:50.682
I just don't wanna
embarrass the team.

331
00:24:50.706 --> 00:24:54.886
David, I've asked God
since you were a baby

332
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:58.407
that he would show how
strong he is in your life

333
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:02.227
and that through you people
would see how good he is.

334
00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:06.865
Then why would he make
me so small and weak?

335
00:25:06.889 --> 00:25:08.989
To show how mighty he is.

336
00:25:11.794 --> 00:25:15.240
Why don't we get washed up
for dinner? We can finish this later.

337
00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:17.164
All right.

338
00:26:09.652 --> 00:26:11.018
Dad.

339
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.586
OK. I'm OK.

340
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:20.255
What were you doing?
You missed a spot up there.

341
00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:22.724
Thought I could get it for you.

342
00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:25.460
I guess I got a
little too ambitious.

343
00:26:25.484 --> 00:26:27.044
I was just trying to
take a swing at it.

344
00:26:40.816 --> 00:26:43.461
So, what does that mean?

345
00:26:43.485 --> 00:26:47.616
Is there a procedure?
What are my options?

346
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.587
Grant, first you need you realize this
is a fairly common problem for men.

347
00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:57.626
Thousands of couples are unable to
have children. You do have options.

348
00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.762
Although there's only a
10% chance of success,

349
00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:03.015
many couples have
tried in vitro fertilization.

350
00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:08.953
We can't afford that. The
other option is to adopt a child.

351
00:27:08.977 --> 00:27:11.723
But it's about as
expensive either way.

352
00:27:11.747 --> 00:27:16.311
If you're interested, I'll put you
in touch with the local agency.

353
00:27:16.335 --> 00:27:19.564
I realize this is
difficult for you to hear,

354
00:27:19.588 --> 00:27:22.451
but at least you and your
wife can make the best decision

355
00:27:22.475 --> 00:27:24.808
now that you know where you are.

356
00:27:39.357 --> 00:27:42.103
Sorry. I didn't realize
anybody was still here.

357
00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:45.540
Hey, Steve. Putting
in late hours tonight?

358
00:27:45.564 --> 00:27:49.077
Yeah, I guess so. I can
lock up. You can take off.

359
00:27:49.101 --> 00:27:51.501
All right. Thanks, Coach.

360
00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:29.016
It's about the boys.

361
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.219
I'm not asking you
to throw him out.

362
00:28:31.243 --> 00:28:32.688
If Shiloh can invest
in a winning coach,

363
00:28:32.712 --> 00:28:35.791
we don't need to
settle for second best.

364
00:28:35.815 --> 00:28:38.293
Let him go with as much
class as you want to.

365
00:28:38.317 --> 00:28:39.561
Alvin, he's a good man.

366
00:28:39.585 --> 00:28:41.829
I'm not saying he's
not a good man.

367
00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:44.199
I'm saying he's
not a good coach.

368
00:28:44.223 --> 00:28:46.284
Come on, Dan.
Just look at the facts.

369
00:28:46.308 --> 00:28:48.286
His record speaks for itself.

370
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.072
We need new leadership.

371
00:28:50.096 --> 00:28:52.307
I still think he
deserves more time.

372
00:28:52.331 --> 00:28:54.940
He's had six years.
If he was capable

373
00:28:54.964 --> 00:28:57.179
of winning, he'd
have done it by now.

374
00:28:57.203 --> 00:28:59.814
Grant Taylor is not
capable of winning.

375
00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:02.984
He doesn't have it in
him. That's the whole point.

376
00:29:03.008 --> 00:29:07.305
I'm just saying I want my son to
have the best football program possible.

377
00:29:07.329 --> 00:29:10.008
My son's got a chance
for a football scholarship

378
00:29:10.032 --> 00:29:12.377
if he's taught by
the right coach.

379
00:29:12.401 --> 00:29:14.445
Matt's gonna be
a senior next year.

380
00:29:14.469 --> 00:29:17.516
I don't wanna see him
lose this opportunity.

381
00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:22.153
Brady, you're awfully quiet.
What's your take on this?

382
00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:24.740
Honestly, I don't know.

383
00:29:24.764 --> 00:29:28.410
Sometimes I think Grant could do a
better job with this football program.

384
00:29:28.434 --> 00:29:34.015
But then other times I think he's
doing just as good as anyone else would.

385
00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:36.668
You could do better
than Coach Taylor.

386
00:29:36.692 --> 00:29:38.936
What we need is a change. - Now.

387
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.274
We're losing booster support,
game attendance is down,

388
00:29:42.298 --> 00:29:45.477
and from the looks of it
we've already lost this season.

389
00:29:45.501 --> 00:29:49.881
Dan, we've got a weak program
because we've got a weak coach.

390
00:29:49.905 --> 00:29:53.139
He's dead weight. We
need to cut him loose.

391
00:30:05.086 --> 00:30:08.499
Have you been at
school all this time?

392
00:30:08.523 --> 00:30:10.268
Yes.

393
00:30:10.292 --> 00:30:13.526
I tried to call you an hour
ago. Is everything all right?

394
00:30:21.136 --> 00:30:23.370
Grant, talk to me.

395
00:30:28.109 --> 00:30:32.357
I don't know where to start.

396
00:30:32.381 --> 00:30:34.347
What's going on?

397
00:30:37.853 --> 00:30:41.499
I was trying to
lock up for Steve

398
00:30:41.523 --> 00:30:44.141
and I overheard Dan
meeting with some fathers.

399
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:48.011
They didn't know I was there.

400
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:56.131
Brooke, they're pushing
him to get rid of me.

401
00:30:56.155 --> 00:31:00.824
Neil Prater, Alvin
Pervis, Luke Rae.

402
00:31:03.028 --> 00:31:09.077
They said I wasn't capable of
winning, called me dead weight.

403
00:31:09.101 --> 00:31:12.396
They can't make Dan fire
you. You've still got support.

404
00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:16.935
You just go get J.T. and
Brady and see him tomorrow.

405
00:31:16.959 --> 00:31:19.125
Brady was there.

406
00:31:25.733 --> 00:31:28.293
They've just lost
confidence in me.

407
00:31:31.006 --> 00:31:35.086
I was so sure I could
turn this program around

408
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.876
and I've just sunk it lower.

409
00:31:39.982 --> 00:31:44.379
Brooke, I've tried so
hard. Why can't I win?

410
00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:48.583
You can win. Stop
beating yourself up, Grant.

411
00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:52.120
Brooke, I can't provide
you with a decent home.

412
00:31:52.144 --> 00:31:55.790
I can't provide you
with a decent car.

413
00:31:55.814 --> 00:31:58.415
I'm a failing coach
with a losing record.

414
00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:04.520
And I can't give you
the children you want.

415
00:32:05.991 --> 00:32:07.941
What?

416
00:32:10.245 --> 00:32:13.057
It's me.

417
00:32:13.081 --> 00:32:17.245
Like everything else is me.

418
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:23.001
We can't have our own
children because of me.

419
00:32:23.025 --> 00:32:27.443
What's God doing?
Why is it so hard?

420
00:32:29.732 --> 00:32:32.877
It's OK, Grant.

421
00:32:32.901 --> 00:32:35.969
It's OK.

422
00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:12.444
"I love you, O
Lord, my strength.

423
00:34:12.468 --> 00:34:16.848
"The Lord is my rock and
my fortress, my deliverer,

424
00:34:16.872 --> 00:34:19.484
"my God in whom I trust,

425
00:34:19.508 --> 00:34:24.689
"my shield and the horn of
my salvation, my stronghold.

426
00:34:24.713 --> 00:34:28.359
"I will call upon the Lord
who is worthy to be praised.

427
00:34:28.383 --> 00:34:30.917
So shall I be saved
from my enemies."

428
00:34:33.655 --> 00:34:36.100
Lord Jesus, would you help me?

429
00:34:36.124 --> 00:34:38.124
I need you.

430
00:34:40.094 --> 00:34:42.907
Lord, I feel like there's
giants of fear and failure

431
00:34:42.931 --> 00:34:45.977
just staring down at
me waiting to crush me.

432
00:34:46.001 --> 00:34:48.813
And I don't know
how to beat 'em, Lord.

433
00:34:48.837 --> 00:34:51.070
I'm tired of being afraid.

434
00:34:53.307 --> 00:34:57.788
Lord, if you want me to do
something else, show me.

435
00:34:57.812 --> 00:35:02.627
If you don't want me to
have children, so be it.

436
00:35:02.651 --> 00:35:05.362
But you're my guide.

437
00:35:05.386 --> 00:35:09.033
You're on the throne.

438
00:35:09.057 --> 00:35:11.357
You can have my
hopes and my dreams.

439
00:35:14.062 --> 00:35:17.764
Lord, give me something.
Show me something.

440
00:35:46.145 --> 00:35:49.465
If the Lord never gives us
children, will you still love him?

441
00:36:09.684 --> 00:36:12.346
Field-goal unit.

442
00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:17.018
Hold on, Joshua. I wanna give David
a shot at this one. David, come here.

443
00:36:17.042 --> 00:36:19.942
This is your field goal.
Put us on the board.

444
00:36:36.778 --> 00:36:39.028
Hit.

445
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.521
It's all right, man.
You'll get it next time.

446
00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:04.115
Dad, I don't even know
why they let me on the team.

447
00:37:04.139 --> 00:37:05.650
Did you do your best, son?

448
00:37:05.674 --> 00:37:08.102
I knew I was gonna miss
it before I even kicked it.

449
00:37:08.126 --> 00:37:11.405
Your actions will always
follow your beliefs, David.

450
00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:14.525
Dad, I can't even
kick it straight.

451
00:37:14.549 --> 00:37:19.347
And I can't walk. Should I just
stay home and pout about it?

452
00:37:19.371 --> 00:37:23.506
If you accept defeat, David,
then that's what you'll get.

453
00:37:28.696 --> 00:37:32.059
Well, Brady,
another fine example

454
00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:35.412
of Grant Taylor's
wonderful coaching abilities.

455
00:37:35.436 --> 00:37:38.766
The kids don't deserve it.
The fans don't deserve it.

456
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:41.152
When you gonna get
a bellyful of this guy?

457
00:37:41.176 --> 00:37:43.755
What's it gonna take?
You got a chance, man.

458
00:37:43.779 --> 00:37:47.158
You got a chance to step
in and take over this program

459
00:37:47.182 --> 00:37:49.276
and carry it up for a while.

460
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.696
When are you gonna
get sick and tired of it?

461
00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.097
You got an opportunity here.

462
00:37:53.121 --> 00:37:55.166
This program's
going in the tank.

463
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:57.489
Ryker's gotta...

464
00:38:12.223 --> 00:38:13.973
Grant, he came to me.

465
00:38:17.812 --> 00:38:20.558
You're not doing any
favors sitting on the fence.

466
00:38:20.582 --> 00:38:23.833
You determine which side
you wanna be on and stay on it.

467
00:38:41.953 --> 00:38:43.953
Mr. Bridges.

468
00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:47.602
Revelation Chapter 3 says:

469
00:38:47.626 --> 00:38:51.222
"We serve a God that opens
doors that no one can shut,

470
00:38:51.246 --> 00:38:54.509
"and he shuts doors
that no one can open.

471
00:38:54.533 --> 00:39:00.481
"He says, 'Behold, I have placed before
you an open door that no one can shut.

472
00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:02.817
"'I know you have
a little strength,

473
00:39:02.841 --> 00:39:08.623
yet you have kept my word
and have not denied my name.'"

474
00:39:08.647 --> 00:39:12.410
Coach Taylor, the Lord
is not through with you yet.

475
00:39:12.434 --> 00:39:14.945
You still have an
open door here,

476
00:39:14.969 --> 00:39:17.114
and until the Lord moves you,

477
00:39:17.138 --> 00:39:20.935
you're to bloom right
where you're planted.

478
00:39:20.959 --> 00:39:24.360
I just felt led to come
and tell you that today.

479
00:39:37.425 --> 00:39:39.892
Mr. Bridges.

480
00:39:42.063 --> 00:39:44.976
Do you believe God told
you to come tell me that?

481
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.433
I do.

482
00:39:49.004 --> 00:39:52.216
I admit to you I
have been struggling.

483
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.152
But I've also been praying.

484
00:39:55.176 --> 00:39:59.056
I just don't see
him at work here.

485
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.792
Grant, I heard a story
about two farmers

486
00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:04.695
who desperately needed rain.

487
00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:07.031
Both of them prayed for rain,

488
00:40:07.055 --> 00:40:11.502
but only one of them went out
and prepared his fields to receive it.

489
00:40:11.526 --> 00:40:14.393
Which one do you think
trusted God to send the rain?

490
00:40:15.997 --> 00:40:19.576
The one who
prepared his fields for it.

491
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.812
Which one are you?

492
00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:24.414
God will send the
rain when he's ready.

493
00:40:24.438 --> 00:40:27.640
You need to prepare
your field to receive it.

494
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:17.734
So this is your new
team philosophy?

495
00:41:17.758 --> 00:41:19.237
What do you think?

496
00:41:19.261 --> 00:41:22.657
I think this applies to
all of life, not just football.

497
00:41:22.681 --> 00:41:26.744
Well, that's my point.

498
00:41:26.768 --> 00:41:30.915
10 bucks if you can tell me who won
the state championship a decade ago.

499
00:41:30.939 --> 00:41:33.384
Walker Jennings. No.

500
00:41:33.408 --> 00:41:35.619
North Metro. Stop guessing.

501
00:41:35.643 --> 00:41:38.255
You know it or you don't.

502
00:41:38.279 --> 00:41:41.175
How about five
years ago? Richland?

503
00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:43.978
That was three years ago.

504
00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:46.647
You can't remember, can you?

505
00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:50.451
Leads me to ask a
couple of questions.

506
00:41:50.475 --> 00:41:54.037
What's the purpose of
this team? Win ball games.

507
00:41:54.061 --> 00:41:57.608
Then what? We get a
trophy. People talk about us.

508
00:41:57.632 --> 00:41:59.977
Maybe, for a while.

509
00:42:00.001 --> 00:42:02.396
Then what? I don't know.

510
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.502
Get a scholarship, play for
college and coach Little League.

511
00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.573
What are you getting at? You
think we're just wasting our time?

512
00:42:12.597 --> 00:42:14.842
If our main goal is to win
football games, then yes.

513
00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:16.727
You don't want us to win games?

514
00:42:16.751 --> 00:42:18.528
No.

515
00:42:18.552 --> 00:42:21.398
Not if that's our main goal.

516
00:42:21.422 --> 00:42:24.835
Winning football games is
too small a thing to live for.

517
00:42:24.859 --> 00:42:26.771
And I love football
as much as anybody.

518
00:42:26.795 --> 00:42:31.747
But even championship trophies will
one day collect dust and be forgotten.

519
00:42:33.668 --> 00:42:37.231
It's just that so far all
this has been about us,

520
00:42:37.255 --> 00:42:40.656
how we can look good,
how we can get the glory.

521
00:42:42.627 --> 00:42:45.573
The more I read this book,

522
00:42:45.597 --> 00:42:47.959
the more I realize
life's not about us.

523
00:42:47.983 --> 00:42:51.879
We're not here just to get
glory, make money and die.

524
00:42:51.903 --> 00:42:55.015
The Bible says that
God put us here for him,

525
00:42:55.039 --> 00:42:57.635
to honor him.

526
00:42:57.659 --> 00:43:00.337
Jesus said the most important
thing you could do with your life

527
00:43:00.361 --> 00:43:03.558
is to love God with everything
you are and love others as yourself.

528
00:43:03.582 --> 00:43:08.179
So if we win every game and
we miss that, we've done nothing.

529
00:43:08.203 --> 00:43:11.315
Football then means nothing.

530
00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:15.652
So I'm here to present
you a new team philosophy.

531
00:43:15.676 --> 00:43:19.407
I think that football is just one
of the tools we use to honor God.

532
00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:21.943
So you think God does
care about football?

533
00:43:21.967 --> 00:43:24.678
I think he cares
about your faith.

534
00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:26.948
He cares about
where your heart is.

535
00:43:26.972 --> 00:43:28.715
If you can live your faith
out on the football field,

536
00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:31.869
then yes, God cares about
football 'cause he cares about you.

537
00:43:31.893 --> 00:43:35.606
He sent his son Jesus to die
for us so we could live for him.

538
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:37.541
That's why we're here.

539
00:43:37.565 --> 00:43:41.412
But, see, it's not just
on the football field.

540
00:43:41.436 --> 00:43:44.148
We've gotta honor
him in our relationships,

541
00:43:44.172 --> 00:43:49.353
in our respect for
authority, in the classroom,

542
00:43:49.377 --> 00:43:51.457
and when you're at home
alone surfing the internet.

543
00:43:57.168 --> 00:44:01.381
I want God to bless this team so
much people talk about what he did.

544
00:44:01.405 --> 00:44:03.784
But we gotta give him
our best in every area.

545
00:44:03.808 --> 00:44:07.955
And if we win, we praise him.
And if we lose, we praise him.

546
00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:12.976
Either way, we honor him with
our actions and our attitudes.

547
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.769
So I'm asking you,
what are you living for?

548
00:44:19.324 --> 00:44:22.436
I've resolved to give
God everything I've got,

549
00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.560
then I'll leave the
results up to him.

550
00:44:26.797 --> 00:44:29.276
I wanna know if you'll join me.

551
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.463
Your attitude's like
the aroma of your heart.

552
00:44:33.487 --> 00:44:37.701
If your attitude stinks, it
means your heart's not right.

553
00:44:37.725 --> 00:44:40.125
He sure is preachy
today. Mm-hmm.

554
00:44:42.597 --> 00:44:44.608
What?

555
00:44:44.632 --> 00:44:48.178
How's your attitude, Brock?

556
00:44:48.202 --> 00:44:49.497
It's fine.

557
00:44:49.521 --> 00:44:51.332
Then you'll be OK with
the death crawl, right?

558
00:44:52.857 --> 00:44:55.870
Everybody on the goal line.
Get your partner. Let's go.

559
00:44:55.894 --> 00:44:59.473
Let's go. Show me something.
10 yards. Move it. Let's go.

560
00:44:59.497 --> 00:45:03.810
Matt, let's go. Let's go, Jonathan.
Show me something. 10 yards.

561
00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:07.348
Show me some power. No knees.
Keep your knees off the ground.

562
00:45:07.372 --> 00:45:10.851
Show me something. Here we go.
10 yards. Show me some muscle.

563
00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:14.288
Show me some power.
Give me some heart. Let's go.

564
00:45:14.312 --> 00:45:18.197
Very good, boys. Very
good. Let's run it back.

565
00:45:23.888 --> 00:45:26.867
Man, that's not even
funny, dude. Yeah, it is.

566
00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:32.439
So, Coach, how strong is Westview
this year? A lot stronger than we are.

567
00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:35.725
You already written Friday
night down as a loss, Brock?

568
00:45:35.749 --> 00:45:38.269
Well, not if I knew
we could beat 'em.

569
00:45:39.854 --> 00:45:42.588
Come here, Brock.
You too, Jeremy.

570
00:45:45.026 --> 00:45:47.404
Am I in trouble now? Not yet.

571
00:45:47.428 --> 00:45:50.628
I wanna see you do the death crawl again
except I wanna see your absolute best.

572
00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:55.779
You want me to go the 30?

573
00:45:55.803 --> 00:45:59.150
I think you can
go the 50. The 50?

574
00:45:59.174 --> 00:46:01.685
I can go the 50 if
nobody's on my back.

575
00:46:01.709 --> 00:46:05.022
You can do it with Jeremy on your back,
but promise you're gonna do your best.

576
00:46:05.046 --> 00:46:08.458
All right. Your best.

577
00:46:08.482 --> 00:46:11.996
OK. You're gonna
give me your best?

578
00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:15.299
I'm gonna give you my
best. All right, one more thing.

579
00:46:15.323 --> 00:46:17.667
I want you to do it
blindfolded. Why?

580
00:46:17.691 --> 00:46:21.738
I don't want you giving up at a certain
point when you can go further. Get down.

581
00:46:21.762 --> 00:46:24.413
Jeremy, get on his back.

582
00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:28.395
Get a good tight hold, Jeremy.

583
00:46:28.419 --> 00:46:31.131
All right. Let's go, Brock.

584
00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:33.667
Keep your knees off the ground.
Just your hands and feet. There you go.

585
00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:37.638
A little bit left.
A little bit left.

586
00:46:37.662 --> 00:46:41.575
There you go.
Show me good effort.

587
00:46:41.599 --> 00:46:43.732
Thataway, Brock.
You keep coming.

588
00:46:45.637 --> 00:46:48.549
There you go. Come on, Brock.

589
00:46:48.573 --> 00:46:49.733
Come on.

590
00:46:49.757 --> 00:46:51.835
It's a good start.
Little bit left.

591
00:46:51.859 --> 00:46:54.460
Little bit left. There
you go, Brock.

592
00:46:56.297 --> 00:46:58.063
Good strength.

593
00:47:00.401 --> 00:47:03.664
You gotta be kidding me.

594
00:47:03.688 --> 00:47:07.551
That's it, Brock. That's
it. Am I at the 20 yet?

595
00:47:07.575 --> 00:47:11.338
Forget the 20. You give me your
best. You keep going. That's it.

596
00:47:11.362 --> 00:47:13.540
Don't stop. You got
more in you than that.

597
00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:15.608
I ain't done. I'm
resting a second.

598
00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:17.010
You gotta keep moving. Let's go.

599
00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:19.112
Don't quit till you
got nothing left.

600
00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:22.933
There you go. Keep
moving. Keep moving.

601
00:47:22.957 --> 00:47:25.502
Keep moving, Brock.
That's it. You keep driving.

602
00:47:25.526 --> 00:47:29.657
Keep your knees off the ground.
Keep driving it. Your very best.

603
00:47:29.681 --> 00:47:31.659
Your very best.
Keep moving, Brock.

604
00:47:31.683 --> 00:47:34.161
That's it. That's it. That's it.

605
00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:37.547
Keep going. Don't
quit on me. Keep going.

606
00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:41.035
Keep driving it. Keep your
knees off the ground. That's it.

607
00:47:41.059 --> 00:47:44.138
Your very best. Don't
quit on me. Your very best.

608
00:47:44.162 --> 00:47:47.625
Keep driving. Keep driving.
There you go. There you go.

609
00:47:47.649 --> 00:47:50.995
That's it. You keep driving.
Keep your knees off the ground.

610
00:47:51.019 --> 00:47:53.797
Don't quit till you
got nothing left.

611
00:47:53.821 --> 00:47:56.967
Keep moving, Brock.
That's it. That's it. That's it.

612
00:47:56.991 --> 00:48:00.688
Keep going. I want everything
you got. Come on, keep going.

613
00:48:00.712 --> 00:48:04.391
It hurts. Don't quit
on me. Your very best.

614
00:48:04.415 --> 00:48:06.810
Keep driving. Keep driving.

615
00:48:06.834 --> 00:48:09.063
There you go. There you go.

616
00:48:09.087 --> 00:48:10.664
He's heavy. I know.

617
00:48:10.688 --> 00:48:13.467
I'm about out of strength.
Then find more strength.

618
00:48:13.491 --> 00:48:16.603
Don't you give up on me, Brock.
You keep going, you hear me?

619
00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:18.338
You're doing good.
You keep going.

620
00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:20.157
Do not quit on me.
You keep going.

621
00:48:20.181 --> 00:48:23.861
It hurts. I know it
hurts. You keep going.

622
00:48:23.885 --> 00:48:26.363
It's all heart from
here. 30 more steps.

623
00:48:26.387 --> 00:48:28.465
You keep going, Brock. Come on.

624
00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:30.034
Keep going. It burns.

625
00:48:30.058 --> 00:48:31.969
Let it burn. My
arms are burning.

626
00:48:31.993 --> 00:48:34.588
It's all heart. You keep
going, Brock. Come on.

627
00:48:34.612 --> 00:48:39.059
Come on. Keep going. You
promised me your best. Your best.

628
00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:41.262
Don't stop. Keep
going. It's too hard.

629
00:48:41.286 --> 00:48:44.197
It's not too hard. You keep
going. Come on, Brock.

630
00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:47.234
Give me more. Give
me more. Keep going.

631
00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:49.536
20 more steps. 20 more.

632
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:53.207
Keep going, Brock. Give
me your best. Don't quit.

633
00:48:53.231 --> 00:48:56.944
No. Keep going. Keep
going. Keep going.

634
00:48:56.968 --> 00:49:00.647
Don't quit. Don't
quit. Don't quit.

635
00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.749
Brock Kelley, you don't quit.

636
00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:04.818
Keep going. Keep going.

637
00:49:04.842 --> 00:49:09.256
Go, Brock Kelley. You don't
quit on me. No, you keep going.

638
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.658
You keep going. Go, Brock.

639
00:49:11.682 --> 00:49:13.726
10 more steps. 10 more.

640
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.829
10 more. 10 more.

641
00:49:15.853 --> 00:49:18.832
Keep going. Don't
quit. Give me your heart.

642
00:49:18.856 --> 00:49:21.768
I can't do it. You can. You can.

643
00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:23.837
Five more. Five more.

644
00:49:23.861 --> 00:49:27.774
Come on, Brock. Come
on. Don't quit. Don't quit.

645
00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:30.811
Come on, Brock.
Two more. One more.

646
00:49:35.656 --> 00:49:40.592
That's gotta be 50. That's gotta
be 50. I don't have any more.

647
00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:48.300
Look up, Brock.
You're in the end zone.

648
00:49:54.859 --> 00:49:58.004
Brock, you are the most
influential player on this team.

649
00:49:58.028 --> 00:50:01.424
If you walk around
defeated, so will they.

650
00:50:01.448 --> 00:50:05.012
Tell me you can't give me
more than what I've been seeing.

651
00:50:05.036 --> 00:50:06.579
You just carried a 140-pound man

652
00:50:06.603 --> 00:50:08.103
across this whole
field on your arms.

653
00:50:12.426 --> 00:50:15.205
Brock, I need you.

654
00:50:15.229 --> 00:50:19.393
God's gifted you with the ability
of leadership. Don't waste it.

655
00:50:19.417 --> 00:50:20.761
Coach.

656
00:50:20.785 --> 00:50:22.985
Can I count on you?

657
00:50:26.024 --> 00:50:28.024
Yes.

658
00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.221
Coach.

659
00:50:31.245 --> 00:50:34.963
What is it, Jeremy? I weigh 160.

660
00:50:54.568 --> 00:50:57.852
All right. Who's next?

661
00:51:02.226 --> 00:51:06.239
Good practice, boys.
See you all tomorrow.

662
00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:07.608
Hey man, for the
first time in a while,

663
00:51:07.632 --> 00:51:10.043
I actually feel good
about Friday night.

664
00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:13.747
Yeah? Why? I'm on board
with what you're doing.

665
00:51:13.771 --> 00:51:16.784
If they get a hold of it,
it'll change their lives.

666
00:51:16.808 --> 00:51:18.941
You count me in.

667
00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:25.358
Grant, me too.

668
00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:28.194
Yeah? Yeah.

669
00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:30.764
I feel like I owe
you an apology.

670
00:51:30.788 --> 00:51:35.135
I just want you to
know that I'm with you.

671
00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:38.026
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

672
00:51:54.645 --> 00:51:57.891
Need a ride, Matt?
No, my dad's coming.

673
00:51:57.915 --> 00:52:00.627
Or at least, he'd better be.

674
00:52:00.651 --> 00:52:03.896
Can I shoot straight
with you for a minute?

675
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.398
Sure.

676
00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:07.200
I feel like you owe
your dad more respect.

677
00:52:07.224 --> 00:52:09.619
Why? 'Cause he's your father.

678
00:52:09.643 --> 00:52:12.356
You don't know him like I know
him. I don't have to know him.

679
00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.975
You need to respect him.
It's the right thing to do.

680
00:52:14.999 --> 00:52:18.061
You know, Coach, my
dad doesn't even like you.

681
00:52:18.085 --> 00:52:21.230
He thinks the school
needs to find somebody else.

682
00:52:21.254 --> 00:52:24.133
That's beside the point. Scripture
says to honor your parents.

683
00:52:24.157 --> 00:52:25.736
All you do is complain.

684
00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.771
All he does is boss me around.

685
00:52:27.795 --> 00:52:30.207
He doesn't even try
to understand me.

686
00:52:30.231 --> 00:52:32.442
Matt, you can't judge
your father by his actions

687
00:52:32.466 --> 00:52:34.044
and then judge yourself
by your intentions.

688
00:52:34.068 --> 00:52:37.213
It doesn't work that way.
You're not responsible for him.

689
00:52:37.237 --> 00:52:38.799
You're responsible for you.

690
00:52:38.823 --> 00:52:40.751
You honor God by
honoring your authority.

691
00:52:40.775 --> 00:52:45.222
You really believe in all that
honoring God and follow Jesus stuff?

692
00:52:45.246 --> 00:52:48.592
Yes, I do.

693
00:52:48.616 --> 00:52:51.811
Well, I ain't trying
to be disrespectful,

694
00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:53.880
but not everybody
believes in that.

695
00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.782
Religion works for some people,

696
00:52:55.806 --> 00:52:57.935
but I'm just here 'cause I
got kicked out of Westview.

697
00:52:57.959 --> 00:53:01.104
Matt, nobody's
forcing anything on you.

698
00:53:01.128 --> 00:53:04.774
Following Jesus Christ is a decision
you're gonna have to make for yourself.

699
00:53:04.798 --> 00:53:06.709
You may not wanna accept him.

700
00:53:06.733 --> 00:53:10.664
'Cause he'll change your
life. You'll never be the same.

701
00:53:10.688 --> 00:53:13.900
I do hope one day you
realize how much he loves you.

702
00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:15.974
I'll see you tomorrow.

703
00:53:27.104 --> 00:53:30.817
OK, I'll get him. Just bring that
trash bag over here. Set it down.

704
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:34.954
Don't you let that touch me.
I'm gonna get him out of here.

705
00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:38.691
Oh, man, he stinks. Ohh, I can't
believe that was in my house.

706
00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:40.394
Just make sure it's still dead.

707
00:53:40.418 --> 00:53:42.595
It's dead. It's probably
been dead for weeks.

708
00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:43.730
Aw, there you go...

709
00:53:43.754 --> 00:53:46.333
You just get it out
of here. Out. Out.

710
00:53:46.357 --> 00:53:49.069
Stop being a... Come
here. Look at it. No.

711
00:53:49.093 --> 00:53:52.472
It looks like a big hamster. Just
come here, come here. Oh. Uh-uh.

712
00:53:52.496 --> 00:53:54.641
Don't be afraid. Just
face your fear. Look.

713
00:53:54.665 --> 00:53:56.543
He's got a cute
little tail there.

714
00:53:56.567 --> 00:53:58.211
He's just got a big stink.

715
00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:01.481
Look. See his cute
little eyes there?

716
00:54:01.505 --> 00:54:03.183
See his teeth?
Look at his teeth.

717
00:54:03.207 --> 00:54:04.217
Almost looks like he's mad.

718
00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:06.319
Ohh!

719
00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:08.155
You're terrible!

720
00:54:08.179 --> 00:54:10.424
I can't believe you did
that to me, Grant Taylor.

721
00:54:10.448 --> 00:54:11.925
You are so bad.

722
00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:13.977
Whoo!

723
00:54:16.003 --> 00:54:18.504
David, right down the
middle. You got this.

724
00:54:20.975 --> 00:54:23.119
Right, set it up. Run it again.

725
00:54:23.143 --> 00:54:26.690
Sorry, Coach.
David, listen, son.

726
00:54:26.714 --> 00:54:29.243
You act like you're gonna miss
before you even kick the ball.

727
00:54:29.267 --> 00:54:32.829
See, we're gonna have to change
your whole kicking philosophy.

728
00:54:32.853 --> 00:54:36.499
Now see, you're kicking
wide left or wide right.

729
00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:38.568
But that ain't what's
gonna get you home.

730
00:54:38.592 --> 00:54:41.404
The ball has got to
go through the middle.

731
00:54:41.428 --> 00:54:43.940
I know, Coach. No, you don't.

732
00:54:43.964 --> 00:54:46.093
What does Scripture
say about this?

733
00:54:46.117 --> 00:54:47.660
Um...

734
00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:50.113
Scripture says "Wide is the gate

735
00:54:50.137 --> 00:54:51.798
"and broad is the way
that leads to destruction,

736
00:54:51.822 --> 00:54:54.817
and many there be that find it."

737
00:54:54.841 --> 00:54:57.771
Now, to us that's
wide left and wide right.

738
00:54:57.795 --> 00:54:59.890
Wow!

739
00:54:59.914 --> 00:55:03.626
"But narrow is the gate and
straight is the way that leads to life,

740
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:05.062
and few there be that find it."

741
00:55:05.086 --> 00:55:06.613
Wow!

742
00:55:06.637 --> 00:55:10.317
Anybody can kick it
wide left or wide right.

743
00:55:10.341 --> 00:55:13.687
My mama can kick it
wide left and wide right.

744
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:16.657
But that ain't what's gonna
get you home. Come on.

745
00:55:16.681 --> 00:55:20.093
It don't have to look pretty.
It don't have to look smooth.

746
00:55:20.117 --> 00:55:22.228
It can look like a dying duck.

747
00:55:22.252 --> 00:55:24.548
But the ball has to
go through the middle.

748
00:55:24.572 --> 00:55:26.633
Oh, my word.

749
00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:29.252
Now, David, you gonna have
to choose the narrow way.

750
00:55:29.276 --> 00:55:32.756
That's the only path where
you will get your reward.

751
00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.590
Now send this ball
through these pearly posts.

752
00:55:34.614 --> 00:55:36.793
Set it up one more
time for me, Jonathan.

753
00:55:36.817 --> 00:55:39.162
David, I've never
heard it that way before,

754
00:55:39.186 --> 00:55:41.931
but there's a lot of
truth to what he's sayin'.

755
00:55:41.955 --> 00:55:43.505
Let's see you kick it.

756
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.433
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

757
00:56:00.191 --> 00:56:03.620
Grant, are you not aware of
what's going on outside on the field?

758
00:56:03.644 --> 00:56:05.005
What?

759
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:07.161
You might wanna
come check this out.

760
00:56:10.151 --> 00:56:13.396
Mitch decided to bring his
Bible class outside today.

761
00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:16.799
Matt Prater stood up and
accepted Christ as his Lord.

762
00:56:16.823 --> 00:56:20.103
It was awesome. He started
confessing stuff from his life,

763
00:56:20.127 --> 00:56:22.539
asking his friends
for forgiveness.

764
00:56:22.563 --> 00:56:25.875
Next thing we know, Bob Duke
stands up and does the same thing.

765
00:56:25.899 --> 00:56:27.477
Kids start breaking
up into groups,

766
00:56:27.501 --> 00:56:29.212
they begin to
pray for each other,

767
00:56:29.236 --> 00:56:31.781
they begin to ask for forgiveness
for sins they've committed.

768
00:56:31.805 --> 00:56:33.350
This has been going
on for three hours.

769
00:56:33.374 --> 00:56:35.152
How did you not know
what was going on?

770
00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:45.345
<i>♪ You never give up on me ♪</i>

Bless them in a special way.

777
00:57:09.794 --> 00:57:12.055
Lord, I ask you to
lift them up to you.

778
00:57:12.079 --> 00:57:16.309
<i>♪ You never give up on me ♪</i>

779
00:57:16.333 --> 00:57:18.744
I ask you to bring
up a generation

780
00:57:18.768 --> 00:57:22.749
that has a heart for you, Lord.

781
00:57:22.773 --> 00:57:25.507
Coach.

782
00:57:30.147 --> 00:57:33.793
I'm proud of you, Matt. I
need to talk with my dad.

783
00:57:33.817 --> 00:57:36.418
I'd like to go see him.

784
00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:40.801
I'll take you right now.

785
00:57:40.825 --> 00:57:44.271
So what we've done here is
we've gained these four lots

786
00:57:44.295 --> 00:57:47.057
by moving the retention
pond down here.

787
00:57:47.081 --> 00:57:48.291
We could try and do that
through here if you want.

788
00:57:48.315 --> 00:57:51.494
No. I like this. That's perfect.

789
00:57:51.518 --> 00:57:54.130
<i>Mr. Prater, there's
someone here to see you.</i>

790
00:57:54.154 --> 00:57:58.301
Sarah, I'm in a
meeting. <i>It's your son.</i>

791
00:57:58.325 --> 00:58:01.504
Would you like me to
step out? No, it's OK.

792
00:58:01.528 --> 00:58:04.062
Sarah, send him in.

793
00:58:08.402 --> 00:58:10.380
Matt, you OK?

794
00:58:10.404 --> 00:58:13.049
I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't
know you were in a meeting.

795
00:58:13.073 --> 00:58:14.639
What is it, son?

796
00:58:16.143 --> 00:58:20.807
Uh... Dad, I just wanted
to say that I'm sorry.

797
00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:25.545
I'm sorry for the
way I've been acting.

798
00:58:25.569 --> 00:58:27.898
I got right with God today

799
00:58:27.922 --> 00:58:29.966
and I just needed to say

800
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:34.437
that from now on I'll
respect your authority.

801
00:58:34.461 --> 00:58:37.129
Whatever you say goes.

802
00:58:38.315 --> 00:58:40.965
That's it.

803
00:58:43.319 --> 00:58:46.449
I could come back tomorrow
if that would be better for you.

804
00:58:46.473 --> 00:58:50.219
No. It's OK.

805
00:58:50.243 --> 00:58:52.344
I'm sorry. I...

806
00:59:05.709 --> 00:59:08.421
For what it's worth,

807
00:59:08.445 --> 00:59:12.214
I'd give my right arm to
hear my son say that to me.

808
00:59:18.688 --> 00:59:20.928
I feel like I'm standing
before a new team tonight.

809
00:59:22.642 --> 00:59:25.372
It's a new day and a new game.

810
00:59:25.396 --> 00:59:30.126
What you've experienced in your hearts
this week will be released on the field.

811
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:32.796
Stay humble but confident.

812
00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:34.770
Why don't you take
this one, Brock?

813
00:59:39.959 --> 00:59:42.738
Lord, we know our lives
are not about football,

814
00:59:42.762 --> 00:59:45.559
but we do thank you for
allowing us to play tonight.

815
00:59:45.583 --> 00:59:47.928
We're gonna give you our best.

816
00:59:47.952 --> 00:59:49.262
If we win, we'll praise you

817
00:59:49.286 --> 00:59:50.946
and if we lose,
we'll praise you.

818
00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:55.151
We'll give you all the honor
and the glory. Keep us safe.

819
00:59:55.175 --> 00:59:57.687
Amen. Amen.

820
00:59:57.711 --> 01:00:00.389
All right, guys. Look at me.

821
01:00:00.413 --> 01:00:02.792
Play hard, have fun.

822
01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:10.772
Hit.

823
01:00:25.656 --> 01:00:27.088

833
01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:11.077
In the Old Testament,
Nehemiah had the task

834
01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:14.047
of building a stone wall
around his city for protection.

835
01:01:14.071 --> 01:01:17.283
But he didn't have enough
people or resources or time.

836
01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:20.319
But because each person worked on
the stone wall in front of their house,

837
01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:23.723
they got it done in record time.
That's what you're gonna do.

838
01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:25.775
On defense you have to resolve

839
01:01:25.799 --> 01:01:27.943
nothing gets by
you as an individual,

840
01:01:27.967 --> 01:01:30.080
nothing gets by us as a team.

841
01:01:30.104 --> 01:01:31.904
I need you to build
me a stone wall.

842
01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:38.455

01:02:20.119 --> 01:02:22.148
Let's go. Let's go.

854
01:02:22.172 --> 01:02:24.634
Run through like
you're throwing yourself.

855
01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:29.738
Come on. I wanna see some
hitting. I wanna see some hitting.

856
01:02:29.762 --> 01:02:33.576
Dig those feet. You ain't on my
team yet. You ain't on my defense.

857
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.263
You gotta dig those feet. All
right, Prater. Get in there, boy.

858
01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:39.398
Hit him a little
harder than that.

859
01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:42.373
This ain't ballet practice.
This is football practice.

864
01:03:12.439 --> 01:03:14.768
David.

865
01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:15.957
David.

866
01:03:32.859 --> 01:03:36.172
Double sweep
pitch lift. Pro 45 fix.

867
01:03:36.196 --> 01:03:37.974
Man, even a 26 Powerhouse.

868
01:03:37.998 --> 01:03:39.976
Man, these are some good plays.
Who's gonna run these plays?

869
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.177
We're gonna run 'em.

870
01:03:41.201 --> 01:03:44.213
We got all type of potential
on this sheet. When?

871
01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:45.848
We're gonna run 'em, I promise.

872
01:03:45.872 --> 01:03:47.616
Yeah, see. You always
tell me you're gonna run 'em.

873
01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.986
See, all my plays - you
don't wanna run my plays.

874
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:52.255
Hey!

875
01:03:52.279 --> 01:03:53.840
Where's my car?

876
01:03:53.864 --> 01:03:57.510
Where'd you park it? Right here.

877
01:03:57.534 --> 01:04:01.080
You sure? 'Cause there
ain't no way it got stolen.

878
01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:03.449
You couldn't pay
nobody to steal your car.

879
01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:07.187
Did the boys do something
with it? I don't know.

880
01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:09.691
Hey, man, there's a
note on this truck for you.

881
01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:14.227
What does it say? Let's see.

882
01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:16.062
It says "Grant Taylor,

883
01:04:16.086 --> 01:04:17.663
"the impact you
made on our school

884
01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.966
"means more to us
than you'll ever know.

885
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.568
"The Lord has used you
to meet a need in our lives

886
01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:24.637
"and now we want to
meet a need in yours.

887
01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:28.308
"You'll find the title of this
new truck in your name.

888
01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:31.299
Please accept it as our
way of saying thank you."

889
01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:34.948
Uh-uh!

890
01:04:34.972 --> 01:04:37.372
Somebody done gave you a truck?

891
01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:46.541
Man, this title got
your name on it.

892
01:04:55.575 --> 01:04:57.325
You got to be kidding me.

893
01:05:02.733 --> 01:05:06.801
Grant Taylor, somebody
done gave you a new truck!

894
01:05:08.939 --> 01:05:11.305
This is my truck?

895
01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:30.085
Is this just 'cause
you head coach?

896
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:31.425
'Cause I'm assistant coach.

897
01:05:32.996 --> 01:05:35.330
You'd think I'd get a moped
out of this or something.

898
01:05:44.724 --> 01:05:48.203
Oh, Lord, you've
given me a truck.

899
01:05:48.227 --> 01:05:52.029
Well, it's your truck. Drive it.

900
01:05:55.819 --> 01:05:58.164
Not a word to anyone.

901
01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:00.433
Yes, sir.

902
01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:11.411
That right. No
more jumper cables.

903
01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:19.652
Brock. Brock.

904
01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:21.571
You watch him. You watch him.

905
01:06:21.595 --> 01:06:23.628
Sure.

906
01:06:38.195 --> 01:06:40.428
Go. Go. Go.

907
01:06:49.256 --> 01:06:50.454
Yeah!

908
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:10.936
Whoo! Whoo!

909
01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.539
Whoo! Whoo!

910
01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:19.545
Yeah! Right there!

911
01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:21.235
Whoo!

912
01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:42.001
Yes, sir? Can I
help you? Please.

913
01:07:42.025 --> 01:07:45.988
I'd like to buy a nice bouquet
of wildflowers for my wife.

914
01:07:46.012 --> 01:07:48.541
I see. That's
awfully sweet of you.

915
01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:52.178
Oh, yes. I've got a special
evening in mind for her tonight.

916
01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:55.415
In that case, you need a card to
go with those flowers, don't you?

917
01:07:55.439 --> 01:07:57.650
Oh, no. I've already
got the perfect one.

918
01:07:57.674 --> 01:08:00.303
I'm gonna give it to her at her
favorite restaurant this evening.

919
01:08:00.327 --> 01:08:03.089
Oh, really? I'm
sure she'll be happy.

920
01:08:03.113 --> 01:08:04.990
Oh, she will.

921
01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:08.777
So I need your nicest, largest
flowers, and money's no object.

922
01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:10.045
Oh?

923
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:14.366
You see, I got a
raise today. You did?

924
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:17.786
$6,000. Are you serious?

925
01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:19.555
Ya know, that's exactly the
way my wife's gonna respond.

926
01:08:19.579 --> 01:08:22.257
Oh, Grant!

927
01:08:22.281 --> 01:08:24.293
Oh, Grant.

928
01:08:24.317 --> 01:08:25.761
That's awesome.

929
01:08:25.785 --> 01:08:28.353
You know, you sure
got friendly service here.

930
01:08:34.661 --> 01:08:38.624
Hello again. This is Lane
Lavarre, along with Dale Hansen,

931
01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:41.660
coming to you tonight from
Princeton Heights Academy,

932
01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:45.164
site of tonight's opening round
of the GISA football playoffs.

933
01:08:45.188 --> 01:08:47.133
For the first time in a decade,

934
01:08:47.157 --> 01:08:49.034
the Shiloh Eagles
are in postseason play.

935
01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:52.438
Coach Grant Taylor's gonna
have his hands full tonight

936
01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.240
as he takes on the Panthers,

937
01:08:54.264 --> 01:08:56.943
who haven't lost
a game all season.

938
01:08:56.967 --> 01:09:00.446
Huddle up. Stay sharp, stay
focused, play hard and honor God.

939
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.920
Eagles on three. One,
two, three. Eagles.

940
01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.221
So, after an impressive record,

941
01:09:42.245 --> 01:09:46.492
the Shiloh Eagles fall short tonight
in the first round of the GISA playoffs.

942
01:09:46.516 --> 01:09:48.553
28 to 10 is the final
score, the Princeton

943
01:09:48.577 --> 01:09:50.835
Heights Panthers take
it to the Shiloh Eagles.

944
01:09:52.405 --> 01:09:54.939
I knew we were
gonna get killed tonight.

945
01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:09.064
Your effort was good tonight.

946
01:10:09.088 --> 01:10:11.806
You've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

947
01:10:16.162 --> 01:10:18.373
You played hard.

948
01:10:18.397 --> 01:10:21.143
The Shilohs had their
best season in a long time.

949
01:10:21.167 --> 01:10:23.518
God's been good to us this year.

950
01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.587
Guys, Coach is right.

951
01:10:32.611 --> 01:10:36.497
We gotta praise God when we
win and praise him when we lose.

952
01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:41.268
Let's take a knee.

953
01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.220
Hey. Hey.

954
01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:08.373
I wish by some miracle
we could have won tonight.

955
01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:11.997
They worked too hard to walk
away with their heads down.

956
01:11:14.237 --> 01:11:17.538
I was hoping God would give
us just one win in the playoffs.

957
01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:23.377
They deserved it.

958
01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:36.269
If you'd told me two months ago we'd
play Princeton Heights in the playoffs,

959
01:11:36.293 --> 01:11:38.203
I would not have believed you.

960
01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:40.806
Yeah. If you'd told me our
school was having a revival,

961
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:42.375
I wouldn't have
believed you either.

962
01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:45.511
This ain't been a bad
year. Got the jerseys?

963
01:11:45.535 --> 01:11:47.079
All 32 of 'em.

964
01:11:47.103 --> 01:11:50.283
But I ain't ready to put 'em up.
I'm ready to go another round.

965
01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:53.386
You and me both. Part of
me wanted to get to state.

966
01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:56.038
To state? Grant,
are you serious?

967
01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.806
Why not? As hard as they worked?

968
01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:00.893
Working hard is one thing,
but to take this team to state?

969
01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:04.396
That'd take an act of God.
Has he not been acting already?

970
01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:08.367
He has, but do you know who's gonna
be waiting for whoever gets to state?

971
01:12:08.391 --> 01:12:10.970
The Richland
Giants. That's right.

972
01:12:10.994 --> 01:12:13.905
Bobby Lee Duke will be
there with his 85 players

973
01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:18.176
ready to spank whoever made it to
the state playoffs to kingdom come.

974
01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:22.348
I'm not afraid. I know you're
not afraid. 'Cause you ain't going.

975
01:12:22.372 --> 01:12:25.351
Oh. By the way, man, some
man called looking for you today.

976
01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:29.020
Who? Uh... Stan Shultz.

977
01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:30.690
Stan Shultz? Yeah.

978
01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:34.393
Stan Shultz. Isn't
that the cartoonist?

979
01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:36.362
That's Charles Schulz.

980
01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:38.397
No, I thought Charles
Schulz was that man

981
01:12:38.421 --> 01:12:40.533
that flew across the ocean
in the Spirit of St. Andrew.

982
01:12:40.557 --> 01:12:42.535
That's Charles Lindbergh,

983
01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:44.269
and it was the<i>
Spirit of St. Louis.</i>

984
01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:48.958
No, Lindbergh is a cheese. Limburger's
the cheese. Lindbergh's the man.

985
01:12:48.982 --> 01:12:52.583
No, Lindbergh was that blimp that
blew up and killed all them people.

986
01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:57.171
That's the<i> Hindenburg.</i>

987
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:03.122
No, Hindenburg is where
you go skiing in Tennessee.

988
01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:05.891
That's Gatlinburg. Gatlinburg.

989
01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:09.316
You mean like the country music
group, the Gatlinburg Brothers?

990
01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:12.665
You guys are crazy.

991
01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:17.153
Grant Taylor.

992
01:13:17.177 --> 01:13:21.907
Well, Mr. Shultz, I was
told you were looking for me.

993
01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:25.766
Yes. Am I sitting
down? Why do you ask?

994
01:13:28.021 --> 01:13:31.033
Hey, Coach, what's
going on here?

995
01:13:31.057 --> 01:13:34.258
Coach is on his way
to let us know. All right.

996
01:13:36.962 --> 01:13:39.263
All right, everybody.
Bring it in.

997
01:13:44.037 --> 01:13:46.081
I want you to know
I serve a big God

998
01:13:46.105 --> 01:13:48.184
and he can do
whatever he wants to do.

999
01:13:48.208 --> 01:13:50.903
He can open what he wants
to and shut what he wants to.

1000
01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:55.340
A team that plays for his honor
and glory will have his blessings.

1001
01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:57.476
Unlike those who try to
cheat their way to the top,

1002
01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.662
like Princeton Heights
did in last Friday's game

1003
01:13:59.686 --> 01:14:02.364
when they played two
ineligible 19-year-olds.

1004
01:14:02.388 --> 01:14:05.534
They have been disqualified
and we're in the next round.

1005
01:14:05.558 --> 01:14:07.920
Get your pads on
for practice, boys.

1006
01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:09.664
We're going to war
with Tucker Friday night.

1007
01:14:19.322 --> 01:14:22.468
Welcome to the
GISA quarterfinals.

1008
01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:26.004
Who would have thought we'd
be seeing the Shiloh Eagles tonight

1009
01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:28.173
in a contest against
the Tucker Tigers?

1010
01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:29.942
With Princeton Heights
being disqualified,

1011
01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:32.845
call this an early
Christmas present for Shiloh.

1012
01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:35.865
Offense, put in in the end zone.
Defense, build me a stone wall.

1013
01:14:35.889 --> 01:14:38.769
Eagles on three. One,
two, three. Eagles.

1014
01:14:42.312 --> 01:14:45.808
Blue, 18. Blue, 18.

1015
01:14:45.832 --> 01:14:47.581
Set. Hit. Hit.

1016
01:15:11.057 --> 01:15:13.569
David.

1017
01:15:13.593 --> 01:15:16.610
This is your field goal. It
belongs to you. Put it through.

1018
01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:26.248
David.

1019
01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:28.872
Hit.

1020
01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:33.944
Yes.

1021
01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:39.595
The Tucker Tigers are
nursing their wounds

1022
01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:41.663
as they face the
end of their season.

1023
01:15:41.687 --> 01:15:44.717
The Eagles, however,
have a little farther to fly.

1024
01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:47.786
All right. What kind of
sick are we talking about?

1025
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:51.273
I dunno. I've just felt really
nauseous the last two mornings.

1026
01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:52.725
And then I feel fine again.

1027
01:15:52.749 --> 01:15:55.227
You haven't eaten
anything weird?

1028
01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:58.646
Not unless fruit
and cereal's weird.

1029
01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:02.417
Brooke, my gut says make
an appointment with the doctor.

1030
01:16:02.441 --> 01:16:07.089
I've been there three times this
year. It's getting embarrassing.

1031
01:16:07.113 --> 01:16:10.330
I'm just telling you what I would
do. You can even use my car.

1032
01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:16.681
<i>With five seconds
left in the game,</i>

1033
01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:18.984
<i>the score still stands
in Oakhaven's favor</i>

1034
01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:21.053
<i>17 to 14 over the Eagles.</i>

1035
01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:23.288
<i>Grant Taylor calls
the play to Zach Avery,</i>

1036
01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:26.691
<i>who pulls the huddle together
for their last shot at going to state.</i>

1037
01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:30.328
<i>It's third down and goal for the
Eagles and the crowd is going crazy.</i>

1038
01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:32.030
<i>They line up in
an "i" formation.</i>

1039
01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:34.166
<i>This is do or die
for the Eagles.</i>

1040
01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:37.319
<i>Zach takes the snap and will give
it to Jacob... No, wait, it's a fake.</i>

1041
01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:41.323
<i>He's got Nathan Markle open in the
corner. The pass is up... He's got it.</i>

1042
01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:44.626
<i>Touchdown Eagles.
Touchdown Eagles.</i>

1043
01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:46.995
<i>Zach Avery completely
faked out the defense</i>

1044
01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:49.597
<i>and made a perfect pass
to win the game 20 to 17.</i>

1045
01:16:49.621 --> 01:16:51.533
<i>Can you believe this?</i>

1046
01:16:51.557 --> 01:16:55.603
<i>The Shiloh Eagles are actually
headed to the state championship.</i>

1047
01:16:55.627 --> 01:17:00.509
<i>A team with only 32 players has
made it to the big dance. Oh, my.</i>

1048
01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:03.545
<i>On the eve of the GISA
football state championship,</i>

1049
01:17:03.569 --> 01:17:08.283
<i>the Richland Giants prepare to defend
their reign as lords of the gridiron.</i>

1050
01:17:08.307 --> 01:17:10.652
<i>It's no surprise they've
returned for this game.</i>

1051
01:17:10.676 --> 01:17:12.720
<i>What is surprising is
who they're playing,</i>

1052
01:17:12.744 --> 01:17:15.690
<i>the Shiloh Eagles, who
started the season 0 and 3,</i>

1053
01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:17.225
<i>have come out of nowhere,</i>

1054
01:17:17.249 --> 01:17:19.761
<i>and through a bizarre
set of circumstances</i>

1055
01:17:19.785 --> 01:17:22.586
<i>now face a team almost
three times their size.</i>

1056
01:17:31.948 --> 01:17:34.159
Sleep at all last night?

1057
01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:36.829
Mm-mm.

1058
01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:38.330
Are you nervous?

1059
01:17:38.354 --> 01:17:40.966
It's a weird emotion.

1060
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:44.602
Part of me thinks we're
gonna get crushed tonight,

1061
01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:47.306
part of me thinks God may
do something awesome.

1062
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:50.592
Sounds like your fear's
about to clobber your faith.

1063
01:17:50.616 --> 01:17:52.727
Hm.

1064
01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:55.029
Something like that.

1065
01:17:55.053 --> 01:17:57.732
When are you going out there?

1066
01:17:57.756 --> 01:18:00.168
I might leave early,
if that's all right.

1067
01:18:00.192 --> 01:18:02.971
Don't worry about me. I'll
just meet you at the game.

1068
01:18:02.995 --> 01:18:05.129
OK.

1069
01:18:06.882 --> 01:18:09.583
Either way, you're still playing
for a state championship.

1070
01:18:13.005 --> 01:18:14.888
Hm.

1071
01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.954
Where's the duck? - Duck.

1072
01:18:35.978 --> 01:18:38.390
Zebra. Zebra.

1073
01:18:38.414 --> 01:18:40.492
Zebra. Cat.

1074
01:18:40.516 --> 01:18:42.627
Cat. Meow.

1075
01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:44.295
Meow.

1076
01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:46.030
There's the pig.

1077
01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:48.200
Brooke Taylor's here again.

1078
01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:51.603
Aw... Maybe she'll
be pregnant this time.

1079
01:18:51.627 --> 01:18:53.627
I hope so.

1080
01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:59.344
- You ready, son?
- I can't find my cleats.

1081
01:18:59.368 --> 01:19:01.080
They're right here by the door.

1082
01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:02.970
Oh, thanks.

1083
01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:09.638
Do you realize you're playing for
the state championship tonight?

1084
01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:13.659
I don't know why I'm so
nervous. I'm not even gonna play.

1085
01:19:13.683 --> 01:19:16.111
You know I'm proud of
you, don't you? Yes, sir.

1086
01:19:16.135 --> 01:19:18.230
Don't ever doubt it.

1087
01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:21.350
Whether you play or not,
I'll be there praying for you.

1088
01:19:21.374 --> 01:19:22.768
Thanks, Dad.

1089
01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:25.543
Let's go pick a fight
with some giants.

1090
01:19:29.015 --> 01:19:31.493
Here's the results
for B. Taylor.

1091
01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:33.584
Oh, I'll take that.

1092
01:19:35.287 --> 01:19:36.698
Ohh...

1093
01:19:36.722 --> 01:19:39.467

Whatever happens,
may you get the glory.

1132
01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:37.495
Coach, what are you doing here?

1133
01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:40.165
You're at the state championship.
What do you think I'm doing here?

1134
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:42.884
Any time a former player gets
this far, you know I'd be there.

1135
01:22:42.908 --> 01:22:44.603
It blows me away.

1136
01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:47.389
Well, how you feeling?

1137
01:22:47.413 --> 01:22:49.424
A little bit nervous.

1138
01:22:49.448 --> 01:22:51.926
This championship, it's
kind of surreal for me.

1139
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:55.246
Yeah. I don't care what
level of ball you're coaching,

1140
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:58.383
it's surreal when you make
it to the championship game.

1141
01:22:58.407 --> 01:23:01.319
Grant, I'm so proud of
you and what you've done.

1142
01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:04.289
I've been reading about the
team and where you've gone.

1143
01:23:04.313 --> 01:23:06.575
More than anything else,
I'm just proud of the fact

1144
01:23:06.599 --> 01:23:08.843
that you finally learned
how to win the big one.

1145
01:23:08.867 --> 01:23:12.414
We haven't played 'em yet. You won
the big one when you accepted Christ.

1146
01:23:12.438 --> 01:23:15.483
Now, as you're teaching
these guys and minister to 'em,

1147
01:23:15.507 --> 01:23:17.219
I think it's fantastic.

1148
01:23:17.243 --> 01:23:20.689
I got it. These players got it.

1149
01:23:20.713 --> 01:23:24.393
I promise you. Win or lose this
game, you guys are champions.

1150
01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:25.811
I appreciate that.

1151
01:23:25.835 --> 01:23:28.680
But while you're here, you
might as well win it, huh?

1152
01:23:28.704 --> 01:23:29.981
I'm gonna try my best.

1153
01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:32.750
This team we're
playing, they're huge.

1154
01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:34.436
They're fast, they're strong.

1155
01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.071
I just don't want my
players to be afraid.

1156
01:23:36.095 --> 01:23:38.540
Well, in God's word,

1157
01:23:38.564 --> 01:23:42.527
he said 365 different
times, "Do not fear."

1158
01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:46.498
If he says it that many times, you
know he's serious about it, don't you?

1159
01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:48.566
I guess so. I
needed to hear that.

1160
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:51.752
Look. You're gonna do great
tonight. I know you're busy.

1161
01:23:51.776 --> 01:23:54.289
I'm gonna go up in those stands
and cheer you on. Good to see you.

1162
01:23:54.313 --> 01:23:57.074
All right. God bless you,
man. Thanks, Coach.

1163
01:24:14.717 --> 01:24:17.895
In about five minutes we
head out for the warm-up.

1164
01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:20.932
I wanna say two things.

1165
01:24:20.956 --> 01:24:24.502
Number one, I love
you and I'm proud of you.

1166
01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:27.456
I wouldn't trade this season
for anything in the world.

1167
01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:32.360
Secondly, you're about to play
the biggest team you've ever faced.

1168
01:24:32.384 --> 01:24:36.331
They're strong,
fast and undefeated.

1169
01:24:36.355 --> 01:24:39.050
So far.

1170
01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:42.120
But I want you to remember
where God has brought us.

1171
01:24:42.144 --> 01:24:44.939
I want you to remember
how hard you've worked.

1172
01:24:44.963 --> 01:24:48.810
We weren't supposed to have
a winning season, but we do.

1173
01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:52.097
We weren't supposed to advance
through the playoffs, but we did.

1174
01:24:52.121 --> 01:24:56.534
We're not supposed
to be here, but we are.

1175
01:24:56.558 --> 01:24:59.888
So if anything in you says this
is a losing effort, throw it out.

1176
01:24:59.912 --> 01:25:03.158
'Cause as I stand here, I believe
that as long as we honor God,

1177
01:25:03.182 --> 01:25:06.278
nothing is impossible.

1178
01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:08.830
Nothing.

1179
01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:11.165
Leave everything
out on the field.

1180
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:14.836
Give your best to God tonight.

1181
01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:17.271
Whether we leave the
field the victors or not,

1182
01:25:17.295 --> 01:25:20.575
we will give God the glory.

1183
01:25:20.599 --> 01:25:26.131
Now, who will go fight
the Giants with me?

1184
01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:55.231
You've gotta be kidding me.

1185
01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:15.680
The Giants elect to receive
after winning the coin toss.

1186
01:26:15.704 --> 01:26:18.749
We're just seconds away from
the state championship game.

1187
01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:21.736
Dale, it is impressive that
Shiloh has made it this far,

1188
01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.138
but the field tonight
really looks lopsided.

1189
01:26:24.162 --> 01:26:26.274
It definitely does.

1190
01:26:26.298 --> 01:26:27.876
I'm looking at 85 players
on the Richland sidelines

1191
01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:30.495
as opposed to 32 for Shiloh.

1192
01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:32.063
Even if the Eagles
had great talent,

1193
01:26:32.087 --> 01:26:34.366
they can't bring in fresh
players like the Giants can.

1194
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:36.751
That's really gonna
hurt in the second half.

1195
01:26:36.775 --> 01:26:38.353
Let's go, Joshua.

1196
01:26:41.796 --> 01:26:45.509
The Eagles kick it off and the state
championship game is under way.

1197
01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:48.112
Jerod House will receive the
kick and head down the field.

1198
01:26:48.136 --> 01:26:50.599
He gets a couple blocks
and breaks outside.

1199
01:26:50.623 --> 01:26:54.269
But the Eagles will take him
down around the 50-yard line.

1200
01:26:54.293 --> 01:26:58.223
The Giants will set up shop first
down and ten, in good field position

1201
01:26:58.247 --> 01:27:00.441
to start this state
championship football game.

1202
01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.910
Get out there.

1203
01:27:02.934 --> 01:27:05.730
Come on. Let's go, boys.

1204
01:27:05.754 --> 01:27:09.534
Wes Porter will call the play for
the Giants. He steps back to pass.

1205
01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:12.904
He's got Damien Fuller streaking
down the sideline. He lets it fly.

1206
01:27:12.928 --> 01:27:15.290
Fuller will take the
pass, untouched,

1207
01:27:15.314 --> 01:27:17.542
and the Giants strike early

1208
01:27:17.566 --> 01:27:19.427
here in the football
game with the first score.

1209
01:27:19.451 --> 01:27:22.330
Welcome to state
championship football.

1210
01:27:22.354 --> 01:27:24.232
Hey, man. This is
a whole new level.

1211
01:27:24.256 --> 01:27:27.168
They're quick off the line. We've
gotta stay further back. I know.

1212
01:27:27.192 --> 01:27:29.970
The Eagles will start this
drive at the 19-yard line.

1213
01:27:29.994 --> 01:27:33.324
Zach Avery drops back
to pass to Jeremy Johnson.

1214
01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:34.559
But the pass is batted
down by the Giants.

1215
01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:36.811
That's right. That's
the way we do it.

1216
01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:40.481
Avery hands it to Jacob Hall
who tries to run up the middle,

1217
01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:42.851
but gets absolutely nowhere
as he is swamped by defenders.

1218
01:27:49.098 --> 01:27:52.744
10, 10, hit, hit.

1219
01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:56.715
The Eagles look to pass,
but here come the Giants.

1220
01:27:56.739 --> 01:27:59.868
That's gonna force the Eagles into
a punting situation on fourth down.

1221
01:27:59.892 --> 01:28:04.027
Whoo! They're getting
desperate. Whoo!

1222
01:28:07.116 --> 01:28:10.395
Jerod House will receive the
kick and head down the field.

1223
01:28:10.419 --> 01:28:13.052
He breaks outside.
He's got some daylight.

1224
01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:38.039
OK. Ref, timeout.

1225
01:28:40.349 --> 01:28:42.193
After gaining eight yards, the
Eagles give up another sack.

1226
01:28:42.217 --> 01:28:44.228
They're gonna
have to punt it away.

1227
01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:46.214
Dale, so far it's
been all Richland.

1228
01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:48.383
I should not have
called that play.

1229
01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:51.152
They're all over us. Nobody's
open. They're knocking us around.

1230
01:28:51.176 --> 01:28:52.887
I know they are, but
they're getting cocky.

1231
01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:56.390
We cannot let them play their
game. Defense, blitz on first down.

1232
01:28:56.414 --> 01:28:58.294
We've gotta get them
off their rhythm. Let's go.

1233
01:29:25.427 --> 01:29:26.609
No.

1234
01:29:38.824 --> 01:29:42.342
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1235
01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:46.896
What universe are
you in? Get in the game.

1236
01:29:52.221 --> 01:29:54.566
So with a few seconds
left in the first half,

1237
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:57.202
it looked as if the Giants were
gonna take a three-touchdown lead,

1238
01:29:57.226 --> 01:29:58.636
but after an
Eagles interception,

1239
01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:01.020
we've got a 14
to 7 football game.

1240
01:30:06.267 --> 01:30:09.814
We can't keep running our normal
plays. Their defense is killing us.

1241
01:30:09.838 --> 01:30:14.351
I agree. We cannot outmuscle
'em and we cannot outrun 'em.

1242
01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:16.788
We've gotta outsmart 'em.

1243
01:30:16.812 --> 01:30:19.857
Trick plays? Just enough
to keep 'em guessing.

1244
01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:21.459
You see another way?

1245
01:30:21.483 --> 01:30:23.661
We can't use 'em
too often, though.

1246
01:30:23.685 --> 01:30:25.095
They catch on, we're toast.

1247
01:30:25.119 --> 01:30:27.498
We're toast if we
don't get points.

1248
01:30:27.522 --> 01:30:31.702
We have gotta make it through the
fourth quarter and they got a deep bench.

1249
01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:36.124
We're still in this game. Good job on
the defense getting us on the board.

1250
01:30:36.148 --> 01:30:37.525
They thought this
would be a shutout.

1251
01:30:37.549 --> 01:30:40.412
We're gonna keep surprising 'em.

1252
01:30:40.436 --> 01:30:43.164
They've got power
and speed, they're big,

1253
01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:45.166
but they're also predictable.

1254
01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:48.420
We have gotta stay together.

1255
01:30:48.444 --> 01:30:53.090
We can't outrun 'em,
but we can outsmart 'em.

1256
01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:55.627
With the Giants leading 14 to 7,

1257
01:30:55.651 --> 01:30:58.713
we get set to bring you the second
half of this state football game.

1258
01:30:58.737 --> 01:31:02.550
Unless the Eagles can find a way
to solve Richland's size and strength,

1259
01:31:02.574 --> 01:31:06.576
the Giants could be taking home their
fourth consecutive state title tonight.

1260
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:12.648
Make it work, Zach.

1261
01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:21.752
The Eagles come
out with a little trickery.

1262
01:31:21.776 --> 01:31:24.016
They're just about to
tie this football game.

1263
01:31:32.688 --> 01:31:35.549
Hustle, hustle. Come
on. Let's go. Let's go.

1264
01:31:35.573 --> 01:31:38.257
Make 'em pay,
boys. Make 'em pay.

1265
01:31:43.081 --> 01:31:45.899
Come on. That was dirty.

1266
01:31:48.871 --> 01:31:50.553
He's hurt.

1267
01:31:57.629 --> 01:32:00.108
Joshua Webster's
being helped off the field

1268
01:32:00.132 --> 01:32:02.743
with, we've been told,
a broken collarbone.

1269
01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:04.545
That came after a
late hit by the Giants

1270
01:32:04.569 --> 01:32:06.898
after the Eagles tied
the game at 14 apiece.

1271
01:32:06.922 --> 01:32:11.685
That was dirty. Calm down.
Josh is gonna be all right.

1272
01:32:11.709 --> 01:32:14.706
David, come here. You
gotta cover for Joshua.

1273
01:32:14.730 --> 01:32:17.008
I need 110%, OK?
All right, Coach.

1274
01:32:17.032 --> 01:32:18.981
Be the man. Let's go.

1275
01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.561
After a long drive,
the Giants score,

1276
01:32:36.585 --> 01:32:38.863
but the Eagles
prevent the conversion,

1277
01:32:38.887 --> 01:32:41.115
leaving this a 20
to 14 football game.

1278
01:32:41.139 --> 01:32:43.050
Why are they even
on the scoreboard?

1279
01:32:43.074 --> 01:32:44.786
They shouldn't
even be in this game.

1280
01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:47.488
For the rest of your life,
you will remember today.

1281
01:32:47.512 --> 01:32:49.657
I want you to remember
that you held nothing back,

1282
01:32:49.681 --> 01:32:53.378
you did not lose heart, you did
not stop fighting, you did not quit.

1283
01:32:53.402 --> 01:32:56.247
They're like little dogs
nipping at your heels.

1284
01:32:56.271 --> 01:32:58.521
Now get out there and stomp 'em.

1285
01:33:02.578 --> 01:33:05.328
That's what I'm talking
about. That's my defense.

1286
01:33:07.783 --> 01:33:09.832
Let's go, Eagles.
He's going for a pass.

1287
01:33:16.758 --> 01:33:18.403
There are seven minutes left.

1288
01:33:18.427 --> 01:33:20.855
The Eagles have shown the
determination of a school twice their size.

1289
01:33:20.879 --> 01:33:26.244
The Giants will now attempt a
35-yard field goal to extend their lead.

1290
01:33:28.503 --> 01:33:30.698
That is the last time
we go for a field goal.

1291
01:33:30.722 --> 01:33:33.801
We should be in the end
zone every stinkin' time.

1292
01:33:33.825 --> 01:33:37.377
Double flex wall.
Double flex wall.

1293
01:33:46.604 --> 01:33:48.587
And hit.

1294
01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:04.565
What are you doing?

1295
01:34:04.589 --> 01:34:08.569
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

1296
01:34:08.593 --> 01:34:10.822
Good job. That's my team.

1297
01:34:10.846 --> 01:34:14.425
Coach, I need a rest.
I can't go much more.

1298
01:34:14.449 --> 01:34:15.716
Brock, I need you on
that field. You have gotta

1299
01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:16.894
stay in the game. I
need you on the field.

1300
01:34:16.918 --> 01:34:18.963
Yes, sir.

1301
01:34:18.987 --> 01:34:21.416
David Childers is in to
kick for Joshua Webster.

1302
01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:24.085
We understand this
is his first season.

1303
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:25.837
He's gone three
for four this season.

1304
01:34:25.861 --> 01:34:28.806
He's been limited
to short-range kicks.

1305
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:31.647
Come on, David. You got this.

1306
01:34:50.635 --> 01:34:51.800
Yeah.

1307
01:34:56.191 --> 01:35:00.905
Timeout, ref. Ref, timeout.

1308
01:35:00.929 --> 01:35:05.043
Coach, I'm done. Someone
else has gotta lead.

1309
01:35:05.067 --> 01:35:08.179
Brock, this is when it matters
most. I know you're tired.

1310
01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:10.131
It's easy to lead
when you're strong.

1311
01:35:10.155 --> 01:35:12.266
But now is when
you lead us, right now.

1312
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:15.920
Can you give me four more
downs? I just need four more downs.

1313
01:35:15.944 --> 01:35:18.255
Four more.

1314
01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:19.941
All right, come here.

1315
01:35:19.965 --> 01:35:23.293
This is our time and you've
got to put the nails in the coffin.

1316
01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:26.947
Look at me. We didn't fight this
far to give up in the last quarter.

1317
01:35:26.971 --> 01:35:28.700
Leave everything on the field.

1318
01:35:28.724 --> 01:35:31.084
And field goals,
they're not an option.

1319
01:35:31.108 --> 01:35:33.754
I need you for four more
downs. Who's with me?

1320
01:35:33.778 --> 01:35:35.873
Now get out there
and get it done.

1321
01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:39.209
With less than two minutes
left, the Giants stand on the verge

1322
01:35:39.233 --> 01:35:41.879
of their fourth straight
consecutive state title.

1323
01:35:41.903 --> 01:35:45.572
A tired Eagles team lines
up to face 'em yet again.

1324
01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:51.305
Stone wall. Stone wall.

1325
01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:53.758
Yes. Stone wall.

1326
01:35:53.782 --> 01:35:55.393
Stone wall. Stone wall.

1327
01:35:55.417 --> 01:35:58.312
Stone wall. Stone wall.

1328
01:35:58.336 --> 01:36:00.231
The Giants line
up first and goal.

1329
01:36:00.255 --> 01:36:03.117
This score will solidify
the state championship.

1330
01:36:03.141 --> 01:36:05.770
Wait a minute. He is stopped.

1331
01:36:05.794 --> 01:36:09.073
The Eagles are still showing
determination to fight this out.

1332
01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:10.529
Three more downs.

1333
01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:15.079
Three more.

1334
01:36:15.103 --> 01:36:19.917
You gotta hang with me. I know it's
getting tough. We gotta stop 'em here.

1335
01:36:19.941 --> 01:36:22.420
It's second down and
goal to go for the Giants.

1336
01:36:22.444 --> 01:36:24.372
The state title is
within their grasp.

1337
01:36:24.396 --> 01:36:28.709
Both of the stands are on their
feet as they get ready to run this play.

1338
01:36:28.733 --> 01:36:32.646
Wes Porter will take it. No, the
Eagles have stopped him again.

1339
01:36:32.670 --> 01:36:35.421
That's my team. That's my team.

1340
01:36:38.493 --> 01:36:40.772
Come on. Get it in the end zone.

1341
01:36:40.796 --> 01:36:42.723
Two more.

1342
01:36:42.747 --> 01:36:45.309
And here we go again.
They're gonna try it again.

1343
01:36:45.333 --> 01:36:50.231
Wes Porter will take the snap.
He's looking to pass into the corner.

1344
01:36:50.255 --> 01:36:53.985
But the Eagles bat down the pass.
The crowd is going nuts right now.

1345
01:36:54.009 --> 01:36:57.488
The Giants have been kept out of
the end zone on three straight plays.

1346
01:36:57.512 --> 01:37:00.241
Bobby Lee Duke will have
a big decision to make.

1347
01:37:00.265 --> 01:37:02.243
We have gotta
go for a field goal.

1348
01:37:02.267 --> 01:37:04.787
We are not going
for a field goal.

1349
01:37:06.438 --> 01:37:09.333
He's not taking
it. Brock, Brock.

1350
01:37:09.357 --> 01:37:13.037
One more down. One more down.

1351
01:37:13.061 --> 01:37:15.389
Fourth down and the Giants
are going for the touchdown.

1352
01:37:15.413 --> 01:37:18.759
This crowd is going
absolutely berserk right now.

1353
01:37:18.783 --> 01:37:20.561
They line up at
the one-yard line.

1354
01:37:20.585 --> 01:37:22.346
Wes Porter's
gonna take the snap.

1355
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:26.767
Brock Kelley's gonna meet him
head-on... And there's a fumble.

1356
01:37:26.791 --> 01:37:32.873
The Eagles have the football.
He's at the 40. He's at the 50.

1357
01:37:32.897 --> 01:37:37.528
He's at the 40. He'll be run out at
the 34-yard line. Are you believing this?

1358
01:37:37.552 --> 01:37:41.587
With two seconds left, the Eagles
have got a shot at this football game.

1359
01:37:47.529 --> 01:37:51.509
We've got time for a Hail
Mary. The defense is too strong.

1360
01:37:51.533 --> 01:37:53.794
We can't run it.
That's our only option.

1361
01:37:53.818 --> 01:37:55.751
You gotta kick it, man.

1362
01:37:57.588 --> 01:38:00.885
David. I need a
51-yard field goal.

1363
01:38:00.909 --> 01:38:04.455
Coach, I can't kick that far.
They've stopped the pass all night.

1364
01:38:04.479 --> 01:38:07.575
You're my best option. The
furthest I've kicked is 39 yards.

1365
01:38:07.599 --> 01:38:09.477
There is no way I can
kick a 51-yard field goal.

1366
01:38:09.501 --> 01:38:13.314
I believe you can. Do the best
you can. Leave the results to God.

1367
01:38:13.338 --> 01:38:14.782
I need you on that field.

1368
01:38:14.806 --> 01:38:17.785
All right. Field-goal unit.

1369
01:38:17.809 --> 01:38:20.587
Grant, we've gotta throw
it. He can't kick it. It's too far.

1370
01:38:20.611 --> 01:38:23.490
No, it's not. What
are you doing?

1371
01:38:23.514 --> 01:38:26.160
I'm preparing for rain.

1372
01:38:26.184 --> 01:38:28.746
I don't understand this,
but with two seconds left,

1373
01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:33.301
the Eagles are putting the game in
the hands of a 145-pound backup kicker.

1374
01:38:33.325 --> 01:38:35.469
This is not a good move
on Grant Taylor's part.

1375
01:38:35.493 --> 01:38:38.144
He even has to
kick into the wind.

1376
01:38:40.282 --> 01:38:41.975
David.

1377
01:38:41.999 --> 01:38:44.217
David.

1378
01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:47.831
He's not ready, Grant.
He don't think he can do it.

1379
01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:51.852
I don't have any more timeouts.
Call timeout, Bobby Lee.

1380
01:38:51.876 --> 01:38:55.072
This kid can't kick that
far. Call that timeout.

1381
01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:58.030
Call a timeout anyway
and let's ice him.

1382
01:39:03.188 --> 01:39:06.033
David, come here.

1383
01:39:06.057 --> 01:39:07.818
You're telling yourself
you're gonna miss this kick.

1384
01:39:07.842 --> 01:39:09.503
Coach, it's too far.

1385
01:39:09.527 --> 01:39:13.541
Listen to me. Do you think God
could help you make this kick?

1386
01:39:13.565 --> 01:39:16.127
Do you believe it, David?
Yeah, if he wants to.

1387
01:39:16.151 --> 01:39:18.929
So do I. Give me your best
and leave the rest up to him.

1388
01:39:18.953 --> 01:39:21.203
Will you do that for me?

1389
01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:32.310
David, whether you make this field
goal or not, we're gonna praise him.

1390
01:39:32.334 --> 01:39:35.317
But don't you walk off this field
having done any less than your best.

1391
01:39:56.274 --> 01:39:58.886
Can I help you? Don't touch me.

1392
01:39:58.910 --> 01:40:00.226
I'm standing for my son.

1393
01:40:03.248 --> 01:40:06.032
God, help me make this kick.

1394
01:40:11.756 --> 01:40:14.568
Take it now. Take it now.

1395
01:40:14.592 --> 01:40:16.409
Hit.

1396
01:40:23.968 --> 01:40:25.196
The kick is up. It's on its way.

1397
01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:26.447
It's long enough.
It's high enough.

1398
01:40:26.471 --> 01:40:28.199
Does it have the distance?

1399
01:40:28.223 --> 01:40:30.368
It does. It's good.
It's good. It's good.

1400
01:40:30.392 --> 01:40:34.372
The Eagles have won the state
championship. Thank you, God.

1401
01:40:34.396 --> 01:40:35.506
I can't believe
what I've just seen.

1402
01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:38.342
I cannot believe
what I've just seen.

1403
01:40:38.366 --> 01:40:40.428
A miracle has
occurred here tonight.

1404
01:40:40.452 --> 01:40:45.182
The Shiloh Eagles have defeated
the Richland Giants 24 to 23

1405
01:40:45.206 --> 01:40:47.301
to take the state title for
the first time in their history.

1406
01:40:47.325 --> 01:40:50.976
It's incredible. It's
absolutely unbelievable.

1407
01:40:52.914 --> 01:40:56.132
You are state champion.
You are state champion.

1408
01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:29.264
All right. You guys, who's
the state champions?

1409
01:41:36.975 --> 01:41:39.019
OK. OK.

1410
01:41:39.043 --> 01:41:43.279
I got something to
say. David Childers.

1411
01:41:48.369 --> 01:41:51.548
Don't you ever let anyone
tell you that you're under par,

1412
01:41:51.572 --> 01:41:55.719
second-rate or inferior.

1413
01:41:55.743 --> 01:41:58.789
I just watched God do
a miracle through you.

1414
01:41:58.813 --> 01:42:01.926
I saw a field of Giants,
85 of 'em to be exact,

1415
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:04.879
fall in defeat.

1416
01:42:04.903 --> 01:42:06.680
Now you tell me what's
impossible with God.

1417
01:42:06.704 --> 01:42:08.037
Nothing, Coach.

1418
01:42:10.458 --> 01:42:15.222
Zach, I just watched you and the offense
do what they said could not be done.

1419
01:42:15.246 --> 01:42:19.459
Tell me what's impossible
with God. Nothing, Coach.

1420
01:42:19.483 --> 01:42:24.664
Brock, how about it? You built that
stone wall, didn't you? And it stood.

1421
01:42:24.688 --> 01:42:28.535
Tell me what's impossible
with God. Nothing, Coach.

1422
01:42:28.559 --> 01:42:31.322
Scott, what's impossible
with God? Nothing.

1423
01:42:31.346 --> 01:42:33.390
Are you sure? 'Cause
those Giants are big.

1424
01:42:33.414 --> 01:42:35.225
They outnumber us three to one.

1425
01:42:35.249 --> 01:42:37.561
Are you sure there's
nothing impossible with God?

1426
01:42:37.585 --> 01:42:39.497
I'm sure, Coach.

1427
01:42:39.521 --> 01:42:42.967
Nathan, what's impossible
with God? Nothing, Coach.

1428
01:42:42.991 --> 01:42:45.736
Jonathan? Nothing.

1429
01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.305
Are you positive?
Positive, Coach.

1430
01:42:48.329 --> 01:42:51.942
So am I. So am I.

1431
01:42:51.966 --> 01:42:55.112
God can do whatever he wants
to do, however he wants to do it.

1432
01:42:55.136 --> 01:42:59.933
And he chooses to work in our lives
'cause he loves us, 'cause he's good.

1433
01:42:59.957 --> 01:43:04.772
Hope today's a milestone for what
he can do for the rest of your life,

1434
01:43:04.796 --> 01:43:07.407
if you trust him.

1435
01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:09.097
Let's spend some
time thanking him.

1436
01:43:27.318 --> 01:43:30.347
Well, look who just
walked in this house.

1437
01:43:30.371 --> 01:43:34.151
Couldn't be the state champion
coach Grant Taylor, could it?

1438
01:43:34.175 --> 01:43:36.770
'Cause he's not
supposed to live here.

1439
01:43:36.794 --> 01:43:40.441
He's supposed to be
out looking for a job.

1440
01:43:40.465 --> 01:43:44.144
God did it, Brooke.

1441
01:43:44.168 --> 01:43:46.001
He did it.

1442
01:43:48.856 --> 01:43:52.703
He gave me this job,

1443
01:43:52.727 --> 01:43:54.871
provided for our needs,

1444
01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:58.776
took away my fear.

1445
01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.250
He throws in the state
championship just 'cause he can.

1446
01:44:08.158 --> 01:44:11.571
It's been one of the
best days of my life.

1447
01:44:11.595 --> 01:44:13.424
The day's not over yet.

1448
01:44:13.448 --> 01:44:16.960
What do you mean?

1449
01:44:16.984 --> 01:44:22.537
Grant Taylor, I just want you to
know that you've made the team.

1450
01:44:23.691 --> 01:44:25.691
What team?

1451
01:44:28.129 --> 01:44:30.979
The daddy team.

1452
01:44:33.584 --> 01:44:35.795
We're gonna have a baby?

1453
01:44:35.819 --> 01:44:38.120
We're gonna have a baby.

1454
01:44:45.446 --> 01:44:48.659
You tell me, Coach Taylor,

1455
01:44:48.683 --> 01:44:52.417
tell me what's impossible
when God's on your side?

1456
01:44:56.223 --> 01:44:59.937
Oh, God. Oh, God.
