WEBVTT

1
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.316
Ah, Grimsby,
the finest fish dock in all the world.

2
00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:09.527
Born out of nothing
when our Viking friend Ol' Grim

3
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:12.155
landed ashore looking to snag a few eels.

4
00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.742
Industry arrived and before we knew,

5
00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.161
it went
from being a tiny little fishing village

6
00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.788
to largest port in the world.

7
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.416
Boats by the hundreds,
thousands upon thousands

8
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.377
of trawlermen, fish caught by the billion.

9
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.464
You couldn't move for smartly-dressed
trawlermen back on land

10
00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:32.300
in their new tailored suits
and their creeper boots.

11
00:01:32.383 --> 00:01:35.720
Money was everywhere,
the whole town awash with cash.

12
00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:41.059
Grimsby was thriving, rocking,
but then rather quickly,

13
00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.144
it all went to shit.

14
00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:45.522
Bowing under American pressure,

15
00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:48.608
Crossland has agreed
to a 200-mile exclusion zone

16
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:51.528
around Iceland,
effectively killing the fishing industry.

17
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.696
Since the end
of the Cold War,

18
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.990
Grimsby's port has gone
from housing hundreds

19
00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:59.244
of independent trawling companies
to just two.

20
00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:02.288
With the closure this week
of Sampson Trawling…

21
00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.791
Barr Fisheries owner,
Donald Barr, looks today to host

22
00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:07.627
what could be a do-or-die meeting
for the company.

23
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.256
…will sell the land as part
of the town's redevelopment programme.

24
00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:19.556
That's me, Curly Dean,
5'11 and 160 pounds

25
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.015
of Grimsby's finest.

26
00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:25.478
So, what does a man who has it all
dream about you ask?

27
00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:31.151
Handsome bastard, tick.
Charming, tick.

28
00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:34.070
Minted, tick, tick, tick.

29
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.740
Well, I will be, once we flog
this ice-packed bounty

30
00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.201
of soon-to-be battered
and deep fried aquatics.

31
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.454
The main thing you need to know
about the common trawlerman is,

32
00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.208
we're not like other folk, we're freaks,

33
00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:50.378
we risk life and limb, make big bank,

34
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:51.588
then set fire to it.

35
00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.882
When my death's
always round the corner…

36
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:55.842
it's 'cause it is.

37
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.221
What we're looking at here
is one of a dying breed,

38
00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:04.684
trawlermen, son of trawlermen,
son of trawlermen.

39
00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:08.021
This is a man with fish in his bones

40
00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.584
and more than two sheets in the wind.

41
00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:13.526
This is a man with seawater
coursing through his veins

42
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.944
like a rare hooky vodka.

43
00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:21.492
Now, I know, you're thinking
this fisherman's rather tasty,

44
00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:25.955
fetching, not entirely
without a certain jus de vu.

45
00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:29.125
Whereas young Budgie here,
you're thinking

46
00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:32.337
this boy could only be half man,
half milkshake on a good day.

47
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.420
Am I right?

48
00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.760
Old Budgie's not really
cut out for life at sea,

49
00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:40.511
he's not really cut out for life.

50
00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:43.115
He only really got this gig
'cause his mum wants him out of the house

51
00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.267
while she's belly bumping Mr Barr,
AKA the Big Boss.

52
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.313
That said, Budgie does bring
his own unique skillsets

53
00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:51.397
to the workplace.

54
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.235
Oh, Curls, I had this well weird dream

55
00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.696
that Mr Barr was operating on me
whilst I was awake,

56
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.115
but he swapped my eyes with me balls.

57
00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.617
I could see inside me scrotum.

58
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.119
Come here, mate, bring it in.

59
00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:08.915
You see what I mean?

60
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.418
Ah, gizza look, gizza look.

61
00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:17.423
We're on, Budgie boy,
best place on Earth.

62
00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.054

Now, my old man reckons
that back in the '60s,

74
00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:20.361
you could walk across the trawlers
from one side of Grimsby to the other.

75
00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:23.740
You see, trawlermen like my dad
were rock stars once upon a time,

76
00:05:24.365 --> 00:05:27.577
screwed by the Tories,
ridiculed by the Liberals.

77
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.788
We've been sold down river more than once
since the glory days,

78
00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.248
but mark my words,

79
00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.084
Grimsby will re-emerge
from the depths like a sperm whale,

80
00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:38.921
or like your old man in a bubble bath,
magnificent boner,

81
00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.673
glistening in the foamy spray.

82
00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:45.720
So, say it once,
say it loud and say it firm,

83
00:05:45.803 --> 00:05:48.765
to the ocean we are born
and to the ocean we shall return.

84
00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:51.559
Don't blow it all at once.

85
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.228
I've not have a sail time for Monday yet

86
00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.147
but when I do, you'll know.

87
00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:00.276
And spare a thought for your skipper
while you're getting off your tits.

88
00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:02.862
I'm waiting on a call
from Mr Barr himself.

89
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:06.032
- Expanding the fleet, isn't he?
- All right, calm down, calm down.

90
00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:08.035
Can I tell Codge he's gonna get
his old job back?

91
00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:10.995
We're gonna need more hands on deck
when things start taking off again.

92
00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.372
You tell that scrub
he'll get his old job back

93
00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:15.500
when he jacks it with them bastard drugs.

94
00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:20.171
It's true, Codge does have
a blood type amphetamine

95
00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:23.341
but what can I say,
all be it addicted

96
00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:26.677
to any and every substance
gracing the periodic table,

97
00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.221
he's a ship mate.

98
00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.723
We grew up together, threw up together.

99
00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:33.351
In a few months now,
there's a big deal on the table,

100
00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:36.646
so I've heard, and if there's
owt worth doing, you'll find out.

101
00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:40.066

home means three things for three days,

108
00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:01.838
money, merriment
and if you're lucky enough,

109
00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:06.092
a brief but exotic STD
previously unknown to medical science.

Whew-hoo!

114
00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:22.984
Whew!

115
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:31.200
The Arctic ranger returns.

116
00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.036
- Cold enough for you, was it?
- I don't know.

117
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.038
- Codgie!
- Hey!

118
00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:38.374
All right, come on.

119
00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.478
I spoke to Alfie Glassell again.

120
00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:43.838
He's snagging a tonne a day
out of the Monterey.

121
00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:46.090
He says California is where we need to be.

122
00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:48.384
He's dragging a lot of fish over the side.

123
00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.721
Halibut, he says,
like you wouldn't believe.

124
00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.014
$200 apiece.

125
00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:54.599
Two-hundred, did you say?

126
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.311
Thirty-pound lings, albacore, schooner.

127
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.731
- Whoo! Get it, Budge.
- Hey!

128
00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:04.960
Are you actually gonna do it, Codge, like?
Are you actually really gonna go one day?

129
00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:09.572
Budgie, Alf says
the sun shines every day,

130
00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.741
not too hot, just…

131
00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:13.868
Congenial spring sunshine.

132
00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:17.955
Yes, congenial fucking sunshine!

133
00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.875
And just the faintest little whiff…

134
00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.419
…of tonnes of California fanny.

135
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:27.798
Yes, the very grandest
of all canyons, I might add.

136
00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:31.219
Mate, I don't mean
to piss on your bonfire

137
00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:35.014
but California
is a million miles away, more.

138
00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:38.017
Curly, this place is done.

139
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.145
Grimsby is as dead as fricking
dead whelks and crab shite.

140
00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:42.623
- I'm telling you.
- Look, I can see

141
00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.982
how one might draw up that conclusion,
Codge, all right?

142
00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:48.027
But the glory days are coming back,

143
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.654
they are coming back.

144
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:53.574
Listen, mon frère,
Barr's in with the bankers right now,

145
00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:57.119
Grimsby's on the up and soon this place
is gonna be wall-to-wall trawlers.

146
00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.539
Budgie, tell the guy, am I right?

147
00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.374
Oh, yeah, hmm. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

148
00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:02.916
You know what?

149
00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:08.506
You guys are the very essence
of institutionalisation,

150
00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:13.302
imprisoned by your own
frost-bitten, working-class limitations.

151
00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.347
It's just that, that's all.

152
00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:20.810
Visiting the child bearers, are we, boys,
like good loving sons?

153
00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:22.853
Interesting proposition there, Wheezy,

154
00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:25.982
though in truth, I was hoping
to forgo these family reunions

155
00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:28.317
in favour of immediate inebriation.

156
00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.101
What are you saying, brethren?

157
00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:33.114
Well, I must concur
with my honourable colleague here

158
00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:35.741
and make only one objection to said notion

159
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.743
that I have budgetary restrictions.

160
00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:41.789
Strike the objection, for the
high street Cash Converters awaits.

161
00:09:41.872 --> 00:09:42.872
In that case,

162
00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:43.915
the motion passes.

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:29.503
We see Grimsby as a real sleeping giant,

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:32.256
ripe for a new breed
of young professional.

169
00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:36.093
Metropolitans who want
to spend their salaries

170
00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:40.931
on artisan coffee,
cocktails, vegan lunches.

171
00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:44.977
The young people don't want fish,

172
00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:48.481
it's just a bit too fishy.

173
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.109
Thank you all for listening.

174
00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.761
Well, for what it's worth, Kelly,
this is the kind of forward-thinking idea

175
00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:01.785
that Grimsby needs.

176
00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:04.705
And rest assured, I can deal
with any untimely planning issues

177
00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.499
which might surface at Whitehall.

178
00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:08.084
I think this is disgusting.

179
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.920
All you care about is your profits,

180
00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:14.340
and you, you politicians,
you care nothing about Grimsby,

181
00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:17.385
- the town, the history of the people.
- A bit much, isn't it?

182
00:11:17.468 --> 00:11:18.636
How is that a bit much?

183
00:11:18.719 --> 00:11:20.655
You come up here from London,
you've never even...

184
00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:22.574
How can you continue going
when you've been doing

185
00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:25.038
the same thing that you've been doing
for a hundred-odd years?

186
00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:29.271
My agenda is the people of Grimsby.

187
00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:38.989
Oh, look at that,
I've seem to have made a terrible mess.

188
00:11:40.574 --> 00:11:41.574
Charlie.

189
00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:48.249
Very impressive, Ms Divine.

190
00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:52.086
Oh, and apologies for the outburst.

191
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.673
Some people in the firm
have been here so long

192
00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:58.300
they think they own the sodding place.

193
00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:01.095
Should you decide to go ahead,

194
00:12:01.178 --> 00:12:05.266
how long will it take to wind things up,
specifically, release the land?

195
00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:08.060
Oh, don't worry about that,
we're well down that road.

196
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:14.692
Well, unfortunately,
I have other business to attend to,

197
00:12:14.775 --> 00:12:17.236
so you can let yourselves out, yeah?

198
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.955
Would you like me
to stick around awhile, Mr Barr?

199
00:12:28.038 --> 00:12:29.039
No.

200
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.960
Oh, send young Gilly in, would you?

201
00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:36.255
We need some new blood
moving forward, I reckon.

202
00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:39.633
It's 12 a kilo, Mike.

203
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:43.053
No, I can't go any lower,
I've got no quota left.

204
00:12:43.637 --> 00:12:45.848
Despite fancying her
since we were kids,

205
00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.617
Gilly's always been destined
for bigger things

206
00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:48.681
than Grimsby can give her.

207
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.496
She worked her way up through
the depths of Barr's fisheries

208
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.400
to become our supreme leader's
right hand woman.

209
00:12:54.231 --> 00:12:55.816
All right, well, it's your call

210
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.210
but when nobody wants your surplus

211
00:12:57.234 --> 00:12:59.629
don't come running back to me
with your cockles in your hand, eh?

212
00:12:59.653 --> 00:13:01.489
And she learned
a thing or two from him.

213
00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:03.866
All right, 12 it is, Da.

214
00:13:06.994 --> 00:13:11.707
- You're wanted, boardroom.
- How's it all going in there?

215
00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:21.383
Three day millionaires,
that's what they called my dad

216
00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:22.947
and his mates back in the olden days.

217
00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.888
See, maritime folklore says
that if you go back to sea

218
00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:27.223
with coin in your pocket,

219
00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:29.808
your ship's sinking faster
than beans through a cowboy.

220
00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:31.894
And in this town, you've got three days

221
00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:33.354
on land supply wage,

222
00:13:33.437 --> 00:13:35.077
that pretty much makes you a millionaire.

223
00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:38.025
Now first the rule
of a three day millionaire,

224
00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.366
if you're gonna
set fire to the world as we do,

225
00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:42.863
you don't be looking
like your mum's dressed you.

226
00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.740
You do it as sharp as Tewkesbury mustard.

227
00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:51.580
Stick around, chauffeur.

228
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.791
Love to, mate. Relax.

229
00:13:53.874 --> 00:13:54.959
Where's the party?

230
00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:57.628
- Budgie's gaff.
- What?

231
00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:08.639
Curly, you said a few.

232
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.670
This is all for you, Budgie boy.

233
00:14:10.724 --> 00:14:11.976
Oh, that's nice, yeah,

234
00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:13.644
I don't see how I benefit from this.

235
00:14:13.727 --> 00:14:17.273
Oh, mate, you'd really think I'd forget,
all right, Queenie's coming.

236
00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:19.942
- What?
- Yeah, Queenie's coming.

237
00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:21.694
Tonight's the night.

238
00:14:27.074 --> 00:14:29.952
There must be a Queenie
in every fishing port in the world.

239
00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:33.038
Loyal, hardworking and well-versed

240
00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:35.249
in the dying art of pescatarian pilferage.

241
00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.627
Ah, fucking hell. Fuck.

242
00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:46.677
Ta, love, you're a star.
Roll on sodding payday.

243
00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:53.267
What the fuck are you doing?

244
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.561
Alan, hunk of Shatoya's.

245
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:59.189
Oh, Curly, she's here.

246
00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:00.983
What am I gonna say to her?

247
00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:03.027
Don't worry, Budge, all right,

248
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.571
because you look
like a right bobby dazzler, all right?

249
00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:11.201
Just be, just be Budgie.
Yeah, but not too much Budgie.

250
00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:13.703
Go on.

251
00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:15.873
A bit of perfume should help.

252
00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:18.167
Can you smell it, Mum?

253
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.045
I'm still getting a whiff
of cod guts, to be honest, love.

254
00:15:21.128 --> 00:15:23.923
Fuck off, you cow. Seriously.

255
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.094
Now then, Marion,
now then, Queenie.

256
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:30.262
Now then, Budgie.

257
00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:38.437
The biggest tie I've ever seen.

258
00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:42.191
What?

259
00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:44.026
Oh.

260
00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:47.154
Go on, treat yourself to some cock.

261
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.573
May I join you?

262
00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:01.460
What's with the straw?

263
00:16:02.586 --> 00:16:06.298
Oh, I find I drink less this way.

264
00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.424
It paces me.

265
00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:13.180
Did you know shell foods are good
for that? Pistachios, oysters. I…

266
00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:17.393
I use obstacles to slow me down,
it stops me gorging.

267
00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:20.562
Do you know I once choked eating lutefisk?

268
00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:31.156
Is this one of your
famous cocktails then, Curly?

269
00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:34.660
No, this is an ancient recipe handed down

270
00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:37.788
from father to son
for over a thousand years.

271
00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:42.042
Ladies and gentlemen, behold,

272
00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:46.046
the near mythical alchemy of Grim Diesel.

273
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.590
Observe, ye the fisherman, ladies,

274
00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.135
as he abandons the here and now

275
00:16:51.218 --> 00:16:55.097
for the fever of dreams.

276
00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:08.110
Hints of a dark fruit…

277
00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:10.654
…of a beguiling,

278
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:11.739
back note of…

279
00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:15.701
Oh, fuck.

280
00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:21.749
The mighty trawlerman returns.

281
00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:25.961
That is Demi, a genuine
aficionado of the intrepid trawlermen,

282
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.838
affectionately known as Pitbull,

283
00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:30.966
meaning takes zero shit from any fucker,

284
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.176
including marine life.

285
00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:33.659
You know what he said to me, right,

286
00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.929
he goes,
"I want that haddock skin side up,"

287
00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:39.308
I said, "Do you?
Well, we want our fucking overtime back.

288
00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:41.310
So you know what,
you can do with that haddock,

289
00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:44.605
you can take that fucking haddock
and you can stick it up your fucking…"

290
00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:45.773
You get the point.

291
00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.446
Codge has been like a tomcat
with three bollocks

292
00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:55.115
ever since then.
Clearly, he's not mentioned the fact

293
00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:58.869
he's not technically a trawlerman anymore,
a troubling detail for sure.

294
00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:05.542
Curly, I need you.

295
00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:09.171
No, you don't, Budge.
Look, Queenie worships you.

296
00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:11.399
No, no, it's not that, Curly,
my mum's on her way home.

297
00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:14.069
Well, we always knew this might happen,
look just go and get her a drink.

298
00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:16.178
Curly, I can't, it's much worse than that.

299
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:17.554
Jesus, Budge, what is it?

300
00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:19.181
Mr Barr's with her.

301
00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:29.858
Budgie!

302
00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:37.241
A travesty to despoil
such a fine and majestic brogue, sir.

303
00:18:39.576 --> 00:18:41.078
I tried to keep it tidy, Mum.

304
00:18:42.704 --> 00:18:43.956
Go on, sod off.

305
00:18:47.417 --> 00:18:49.920
- Sorry, Budgie's mum.
- Hmm-mm.

306
00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:52.131
Dipshit.

307
00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:55.759
Come on, Budgie.

308
00:18:57.177 --> 00:19:00.055
Ah, just spruce up the gaff
for you, Mrs Budgel.

309
00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:04.518
Oh, and just a little something
for the inconvenience.

310
00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:07.521
I thought you'd be involved in this,
Curly Dean.

311
00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:10.607
Go on then, clear off.

312
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.487
Ah, Mr Barr, how did the big meeting go?

313
00:19:16.071 --> 00:19:17.614
Got any news for the troops?

314
00:19:18.198 --> 00:19:19.950
You're Teapot's lad, aren't you?

315
00:19:22.202 --> 00:19:25.247
Well, you can tell the troops
that the news is good.

316
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:29.126
In fact, it's great news,
decisions have been made,

317
00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:33.297
papers have been signed
and an announcement is imminent.

318
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.849
- Now, where were we?
- Oh.

319
00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:54.943
That's the last of it, Charlie.

320
00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.613
I'll be back Monday to transfer it
to Mr Barr's client.

321
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.260
Lots of rumours going round in there
with your name attached.

322
00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:22.945
You ought not to lead them on like that.

323
00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:25.641
Just keeping up morale, Mr G.

324
00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:28.977
Oh, aye. Or leading them
on a merry dance you mean.

325
00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:32.439
Now, I assume we've all met Mr G.

326
00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:35.275
Ex-trawlerman, turned to the dark side.

327
00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:39.279
Though to be fair, I'd have
a face like a smacked arse too,

328
00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:42.366
if my wife traded me in
for a Greek Adonis with a hedge fund.

329
00:20:44.117 --> 00:20:46.745
A bit marly, aren't we?
Goldfish days, wasn't it?

330
00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:52.709
Obviously you don't know.

331
00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:55.879
- Know what?
- You're finished, lad.

332
00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:59.716
In short, we all are, you, me, them lot.

333
00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:02.511
Barr's pulled the plug.

334
00:21:04.554 --> 00:21:08.392
No, I was with Barr earlier
and he says it was good news.

335
00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:12.062
Yeah, there is for him,
he's flogged the docks,

336
00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:14.856
purchased by the Divine Residential Group.

337
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.900
It's got a nice little ring to it
that, hasn't it?

338
00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:21.280
You were in the meeting.

339
00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:26.076
Yeah, and I hope you like drinking
bucket loads of shite coffee

340
00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:29.246
and eating overpriced muffins
because that is what's happening.

341
00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:34.042
They're like an army taking over towns
with their franchises,

342
00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:38.088
kids serving bloody kids on a minimum wage
working for fat cat owners

343
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:40.215
who will never step foot near this place.

344
00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.428
Barr wouldn't sell the golden goose,
why would he?

345
00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:47.264
It's all right,
don't worry, you'll get another job.

346
00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:50.100
I mean, do you like making frappuccinos?

347
00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.688
- What about the MP?
- Huh?

348
00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:56.773
The guy who was on the TV,

349
00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:59.234
the guy trying to save
the fishing industry.

350
00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:02.446
Politicians love talking
about how much they care

351
00:22:02.529 --> 00:22:06.283
about our industry when the fact is,
when it matters, Curly,

352
00:22:06.366 --> 00:22:07.909
they couldn't care less.

353
00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:12.748
It's the sprawl, Curly lad.

354
00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:15.666
They found us.

355
00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:20.380
They found us and you know it.

356
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:28.388
It can't end like this. It can't.

357
00:22:29.097 --> 00:22:30.515
Our livelihoods,

358
00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:32.059
our very lives depend on it.

359
00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:34.537
- Curly, where are you going?
- I'm going to go and see Barr.

360
00:22:34.561 --> 00:22:36.480
Well, he's not gonna
tell you the truth, is he?

361
00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:38.940
Listen to me,
you're a nobody just like me.

362
00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:41.610
- Look, we have to something!
- Curly, stop.

363
00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:44.696
Right, you've got your head
buried in the sand, lad.

364
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.741
Our industry has been dying for years.

365
00:22:47.824 --> 00:22:49.493
Just ask your old man. This…

366
00:22:49.576 --> 00:22:52.412
I mean, this,
this is just a final nail in the coffin.

367
00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:55.665
All right, so that's it then, is it, huh?
We just turn over and die?

368
00:22:56.583 --> 00:22:58.311
My old man says
the glory days are coming back

369
00:22:58.335 --> 00:23:00.170
and guess what? I believe him.

370
00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:03.381
The papers are signed, son,
I've seen it happen!

371
00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:06.134
We're just dead wood now.

372
00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:12.432
Just look after yourself, eh, kid.

373
00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:37.165
There he is, man of the hour.

374
00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:41.336
Yeah, hold on to these for us, brother.
Cass is bound to be on to us.

375
00:23:42.462 --> 00:23:45.090
For those who seek passage
to the other side

376
00:23:45.173 --> 00:23:46.466
of the midnight hour.

377
00:23:54.307 --> 00:23:56.685
You don't think
me and Codge will last, do you?

378
00:23:57.185 --> 00:23:58.103
I can tell.

379
00:23:58.186 --> 00:24:00.939
No, it's not that,
it's just I am the last person

380
00:24:01.022 --> 00:24:03.608
you should talk to about love, trust us.

381
00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:05.902
That's a pisser at the moment.

382
00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:11.741
Don't do anything silly, will you, Dems?
Don't get stuck.

383
00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:16.454
I just mean that none of us know
what the future holds,

384
00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:19.207
so just be careful, yeah?

385
00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:22.252
And why was it
you really came out tonight, Gilly?

386
00:24:22.335 --> 00:24:23.920
To see Curly Dean, yeah?

387
00:24:24.504 --> 00:24:26.548
So, pot and kettle.

388
00:24:27.215 --> 00:24:28.215
Come on.

389
00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:23.938
Yeah!

390
00:25:24.898 --> 00:25:27.108
I never had you pegged
as a clubber, Mr G.

391
00:25:29.694 --> 00:25:34.532
Yeah, I was the life and soul once,
Curly lad, just like you.

392
00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:40.247
And this seat here,
this is where we met, me and Ginny.

393
00:25:42.332 --> 00:25:43.959
What's he doing with his ships?

394
00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.293
They're written off.

395
00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:48.797
Barr's brother
works for the loss adjusters,

396
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.507
so he's got me scrapping them for cash,

397
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.343
a nice little tax-free bonus for himself.

398
00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:57.973
Why can't you just get the investors
to put money in, huh, revive the industry?

399
00:25:58.056 --> 00:26:00.141
Because it's land they're after, lad.

400
00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:04.187
Riverside locations, not fucking fish.

401
00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:08.233
So, what do you want, Mr G?

402
00:26:08.316 --> 00:26:09.985
I assume you're not here on the pull.

403
00:26:11.027 --> 00:26:12.988
Yep, well, you know, I've been thinking

404
00:26:14.197 --> 00:26:16.825
and at first I thought it was just
a reaction to everything but…

405
00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:20.136
but now, I can't get it out of my head.

406
00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:22.038
Go on.

407
00:26:22.122 --> 00:26:27.419
It's the company safe, Curly,
it's fit to burst but not for long.

408
00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:32.048
Barr, he's got this cash
for cryptocurrency thing going on.

409
00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:35.969
What are you saying, Mr G?

410
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:41.266
What I'm saying is, is maybe I'm saying,

411
00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:42.349
just maybe,

412
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:47.230
we could empty that safe before he does.

413
00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:53.486
You'd die for that company
and now you wanna rob the place?

414
00:26:55.905 --> 00:26:56.906
Give me a break.

415
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.991
Yeah, well, why not?

416
00:26:58.908 --> 00:27:02.329
They're robbing me
and it's like you said, Curly lad,

417
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:06.291
we can't just roll over and die, can we?

418
00:27:08.043 --> 00:27:10.003
I think it's past your bedtime, Mr G.

419
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.881
Sweet dreams.

420
00:27:21.097 --> 00:27:23.308
You can't carry on
living in the past, Curly.

421
00:27:24.684 --> 00:27:27.187
Your dad's days
of the three day millionaires,

422
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.270
they're gone.

423
00:27:29.064 --> 00:27:30.190
The world has moved on.

424
00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:33.127
And if you carry on clinging
onto the past,

425
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:34.527
it'll leave you behind too.

426
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.780
Listen to me.

427
00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:42.994
There is over 500 grand
sitting in that bloody safe.

428
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.873
The sort of money the likes of me and you,
we don't come across too often.

429
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:52.796
Well, do it then. What you asking me for?

430
00:27:53.546 --> 00:27:57.384
Because, it's not just
a one-man job now, is it?

431
00:28:01.596 --> 00:28:02.931
Enjoy your life, Mr G.

432
00:28:03.973 --> 00:28:08.103
We could use that money to set up our own
little fishing operation on the north bank

433
00:28:09.562 --> 00:28:13.817
and get your old man,
get your old man to skipper for us.

434
00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:18.488
Get him up off his arse
and get him back out there.

435
00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:23.326
You're a fucking trawlerman, Curly,
like me and like your old man

436
00:28:23.993 --> 00:28:25.954
and nothing you can do can change that.

437
00:28:26.621 --> 00:28:29.624
The only question is,
are you ready to fight for who you are?

438
00:28:38.591 --> 00:28:41.302
Curly, wait, where are you going?

439
00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:42.929
Do you not wanna come in for a drink?

440
00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:44.973
Is it true, Gilly?

441
00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.099
What?

442
00:28:46.182 --> 00:28:50.395
Barr, hmm? Flogging the docks,
shutting shop, is it true?

443
00:28:50.478 --> 00:28:53.440
- Curly.
- How long you known?

444
00:28:56.359 --> 00:29:01.030
When… The last trip
when me and you was, uh… Wow!

445
00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:02.115
Curly, listen.

446
00:29:03.783 --> 00:29:05.994
Things just, they can't stay the same,

447
00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:07.370
all right, trust me.

448
00:29:07.996 --> 00:29:10.081
You just go out
and catch fish and get paid

449
00:29:10.165 --> 00:29:11.809
but I see what's going on
through the books.

450
00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:15.587
You, eh? Proper little management, eh?

451
00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.965
Fair fucking play to you,
fair fucking play.

452
00:29:19.048 --> 00:29:20.800
You know me, I deserve it.

453
00:29:20.884 --> 00:29:23.303
Curly, wait, Curly!

454
00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:26.597
Curly, wait!

455
00:29:26.639 --> 00:29:29.309
Do you know what? I'm fine, Gilly,
all right? Just go back inside.

456
00:29:29.392 --> 00:29:31.770
Just stop bloody talking
for a minute, will ya?

457
00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:33.437
Just…

458
00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:35.899
I can't believe I'm doing this.

459
00:29:35.982 --> 00:29:37.650
Just give me a minute, all right?

460
00:29:42.322 --> 00:29:46.201
All that stuff in there, yeah,
that's just my job, that's all it is.

461
00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:47.660
Yeah, and that's mine, as it goes!

462
00:29:47.744 --> 00:29:50.789
Okay fine, but they're just our jobs,
is what I'm saying.

463
00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:51.790
I'm going, Gilly.

464
00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:53.458
No, Curly, I like you.

465
00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:00.673
You just…

466
00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:03.593
You've got into my head
or under my skin or something

467
00:30:03.676 --> 00:30:05.696
and every cell in my body
is telling me that I shouldn't

468
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.889
but I like you.

469
00:30:11.017 --> 00:30:12.017
I mean…

470
00:30:12.936 --> 00:30:15.396
I mean, more than like.

472
00:30:38.002 --> 00:30:40.547

you won't do anything stupid, Curly.

473
00:30:41.798 --> 00:30:43.007
I promise.

474
00:30:53.476 --> 00:30:56.980

475
00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:06.155
Why do they call you Queenie?

476
00:31:08.908 --> 00:31:10.785
Mum told me that when I were born,

477
00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:14.664
my granddad said that he could tell
I'd do something special one day,

478
00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:17.417
that's why they called us Queenie.

479
00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:20.169
It weren't your life's dream
to work with scallops?

480
00:31:22.171 --> 00:31:24.924
My career's officer
said there were two things on offer,

481
00:31:25.508 --> 00:31:27.760
hairdressing or shellfish.

482
00:31:28.928 --> 00:31:31.681
And Mum worked at Barr's so she got us in.

483
00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:35.602
I like shellfish. Eh, they're salty,

484
00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:38.438
and they come in a shell, always a bonus.

485
00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:43.026
But I'm not a very good fisherman though.

486
00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:46.112
Curly says I am,
that's why he always bunks in with me,

487
00:31:46.195 --> 00:31:50.950
but, no, Mr Barr only gave me the job
'cause my mum kept nagging him.

488
00:31:51.034 --> 00:31:52.410
You're a good dancer though.

489
00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:54.119
You think so?

490
00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:55.579
I love dancing.

491
00:31:58.291 --> 00:32:01.753
And your… your granddad, he was…

492
00:32:04.964 --> 00:32:08.259
You know what he said to the Coast Guard
just before the ship sank?

493
00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:11.596
They asked him what his intentions were,

494
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.309
but he couldn't do anything,
only a mile out from port and all.

495
00:32:18.394 --> 00:32:22.148
He said to 'em, "I have no intentions.

496
00:32:22.857 --> 00:32:25.401
Please give all the men's love
to all the families."

497
00:32:26.361 --> 00:32:27.612
Them were his last words.

498
00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:29.279
Wow.

499
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:33.117
You know, I don't think
I could ever be that brave.

500
00:32:33.201 --> 00:32:34.953
No one knows what could be, Budgie.

501
00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:39.707
Not unless we're there,
right there in that moment.

502
00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:45.588
Queenie, do you ever think
about leaving Grimsby

503
00:32:46.172 --> 00:32:47.882
and starting again?

504
00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:56.140

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:09.797
It's funny, isn't it?

510
00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:13.301
My mum was already married by my age.

511
00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:16.763
- Crazy.
- Well, yeah. I used to think so but…

512
00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:21.559
I don't know,
I know it's old-fashioned and that

513
00:34:21.642 --> 00:34:22.642
but…

514
00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:25.396
I would if you would.

515
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.690
Pitbull, slow down.

516
00:34:27.774 --> 00:34:29.358
Well, why not?

517
00:34:29.442 --> 00:34:31.002
You're a trawlerman, for Christ's sake,

518
00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:33.627
there's not many women who'd
put up with that like I do, you know?

519
00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:36.449
I think we'd make a great team.

520
00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:39.660
You catch the fish, I pack them.

521
00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:53.966

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:56.177
we're supposed to be bloody adults, Codge.

523
00:35:04.977 --> 00:35:07.730
- Oh, fuck.
- So sorry, bub, I really am.

524
00:35:09.065 --> 00:35:11.692
I really am. Love, I'm sorry, okay?

525
00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:15.822
What the fuck is going on, Gilly?

526
00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:17.865
I wanted to say something last night,

527
00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:20.034
- I really did, I just… I wasn't allowed.
- What?

528
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.460
No, this can't happen.

529
00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.797
Has Codge been let go and all?

530
00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:38.052
- What do you mean?
- Codge, is he being let go and all?

531
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:42.056
Codge doesn't work for Barr's,
he hasn't done it in ages.

532
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.018
- What? No, you're lying.
- I thought you knew, Da.

533
00:35:46.102 --> 00:35:48.896
It's the pills, gross misconduct.

534
00:35:50.273 --> 00:35:52.733
- You're a liar, Gilly Seymore.
- Demi.

535
00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:54.569
That's what you are,
you're a fucking liar.

00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:56.195

Shit.

Halle-fucking-lujah.

540

Entrée.

541

Entrée, entrée.

542
00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.014
Hey, what are you doing, mate?

543
00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:24.974
Mate, you got those pills,
seriously, Curly.

544
00:36:25.057 --> 00:36:27.185
No, look, I need you sober, all right?

545
00:36:27.977 --> 00:36:29.061
Tell me about the dream.

546
00:36:29.145 --> 00:36:30.396
- What dream?
- The dream.

547
00:36:30.479 --> 00:36:33.065
The Alfie Glassell,
the California sunshine,

548
00:36:33.149 --> 00:36:34.483
the pansy fucking boats.

549
00:36:34.567 --> 00:36:36.420
Fine, fine. Mate,
just give me the fucking pills!

550
00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:37.445
Fuck off, Codge!

551
00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:39.655
Don't touch me, man!
Melt your fuckin' head in!

552
00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:41.884
Look, we need to do something, all right?
We've got to.

553
00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:43.576
Barr is selling the docks, we're done.

554
00:36:43.659 --> 00:36:45.369
Yeah, I could've told you that,

555
00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:47.413
I did tell you that, many times.

556
00:36:47.496 --> 00:36:49.308
Just tell me about
the fucking dream, will you?

557
00:36:49.332 --> 00:36:51.751
Shall I tell you what dreams are, Curly?

558
00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:54.420
Dreams are there
to get you through the night,

559
00:36:54.503 --> 00:36:57.840
when the waves are crashing over the bow
and I'm still fuck of a long way off.

560
00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:01.084
They're not meant to be lived.

561
00:37:01.135 --> 00:37:02.762
- Okay?
- Then what were you on about?

562
00:37:02.845 --> 00:37:05.431
Alfie Glassell's
doing 15 years in Rampton.

563
00:37:05.514 --> 00:37:07.850
I went to see him.
Thinks his mother's the March Hare.

564
00:37:07.934 --> 00:37:09.374
He thinks he's living in Santa Cruz.

565
00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:11.562
Yeah? So then what was all that about?

566
00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:16.943
Look, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry and the name's not Codge.

567
00:37:17.026 --> 00:37:19.320
It's Andrew Pearson and I'm full of shit.

568
00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:22.365
Now, please, pretty fucking please,

569
00:37:23.282 --> 00:37:25.576
can I have my mind-altering drugs back?

570
00:37:26.535 --> 00:37:27.535
Hi, Demi.

571
00:37:29.497 --> 00:37:31.916
- Hi, beautiful.
- You shut the fuck up!

572
00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:34.669
- And you.
- I'll see myself out.

573
00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:36.003
Great.

Been thinking about going back
out with you, get my sea legs back.

586
00:39:10.056 --> 00:39:13.267
Can't find a boat for love nor money
at the moment, like.

Aye. It'll come back, it's just a lull.

Hey, what about what about your boat?

590
00:39:28.407 --> 00:39:30.326
I told you I used to sail out for Barr

591
00:39:30.409 --> 00:39:31.911
back in the day, didn't I?

592
00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:35.289
Yeah, yeah, you did, Dad, yeah.

593
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.501
Well, I won't slow you down or owt.

594
00:39:38.584 --> 00:39:40.878
He knows I'm a good grafter.

595
00:39:43.923 --> 00:39:46.217
I left a few messages for him but…

596
00:39:47.968 --> 00:39:52.515
Yeah. Well, I don't think
it really works like that anymore, Dad,

597
00:39:52.598 --> 00:39:56.268
I think you have to email your CV
and all that crap.

598
00:39:57.645 --> 00:39:58.645
Oh?

599
00:40:01.315 --> 00:40:04.819
Might need you to borrow us a few bump,
get myself set up, all that.

600
00:40:07.029 --> 00:40:08.280
Yeah, no problem, Dad.

601
00:40:09.615 --> 00:40:11.242
You know me, always minted.

602
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.757
Might have to move back in for a bit,
if that's all right.

603
00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:29.635
Oh, room's still there.

604
00:40:37.685 --> 00:40:38.936

606
00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:49.905
Aye! Back out
on tomorrow's tide, are you?

607
00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:54.869
Just waiting to hear.
Couple of quota problems.

608
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:57.371
Pissing frogs, are you?

609
00:40:58.914 --> 00:41:01.226
They should have never allowed
that 200-mile exclusion zone

610
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.710
round Iceland, should they, Dad?

611
00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:04.712
Yeah, you're not wrong there, lad.

612
00:41:05.463 --> 00:41:07.965
If we dragged out
our sovereignty that pissing far,

613
00:41:08.048 --> 00:41:10.676
every bastard in Paris
would be eating pie and chips

614
00:41:10.759 --> 00:41:13.387
and playing pissing bingo.

615
00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:16.765
Aye, oh.

616
00:41:17.933 --> 00:41:21.729

617
00:41:24.356 --> 00:41:28.444
Oh, they've said I have to go back
to that doctor, you know?

618
00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:32.156
- What?
- Don't worry, you know what they're like.

619
00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:34.200
They always find something wrong with you.

620
00:41:35.284 --> 00:41:37.044
Yeah, but you're gonna go though,
aren't you?

621
00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:40.331
They'll only tell us
I can't drink no more, son.

622
00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:44.418
What kind of life's that
for an old sea dog like me, eh?

623
00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:46.712
What's all that talk?

624
00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:50.925
Here, Dad…

625
00:41:52.301 --> 00:41:55.262
How'd you feel about
getting back in the wheelhouse?

626
00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.723
What are you on about?

627
00:41:57.806 --> 00:42:01.268
Honestly, I've had an offer, business,

628
00:42:02.269 --> 00:42:04.189
a chance to go halves
with one of the big bosses.

629
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.707
You remember Charlie Graham, don't you?

630
00:42:05.731 --> 00:42:07.566
DL's son. Honest?

631
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.193
Yeah, honest. Eh?

632
00:42:09.985 --> 00:42:13.531
What do you reckon?
Tap up the mackerel grounds in the north.

633
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.325
Nobody knows them waters like you do.

634
00:42:16.408 --> 00:42:18.786
Aye, aye, you're not wrong there.

635
00:42:21.163 --> 00:42:23.563
Aye, so you're on board then, yeah?
You're gonna do it, yeah?

636
00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:27.795
I'll tell you what, son,
you just try and bloody stop me.

637
00:42:29.004 --> 00:42:32.132
Mr G, it's Curly. We're in.

638
00:42:33.968 --> 00:42:35.219

640
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.568
It's just my mum I'm upset for, Budge.

641
00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:54.113
I'll get a start somewhere.

642
00:43:01.453 --> 00:43:02.453
Who is it?

643
00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:04.790
It's Curly.

644
00:43:05.958 --> 00:43:08.398
Hey, they're having a business meeting
and they want me there.

645
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.878
Then go, silly.

646
00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.006
Budgie, go.

647
00:43:13.674 --> 00:43:15.676
I'm gonna get you
your Mum's job back, Queenie.

648
00:43:16.468 --> 00:43:19.513
And yours, all right? Just you watch.

649
00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:24.393
- Look at me, you know how this works.
- Go on, how? Tell me.

650
00:43:24.476 --> 00:43:26.663
How else am I supposed
to get through those 24 hour shifts?

651
00:43:26.687 --> 00:43:30.107
Oh, yeah? And when exactly
was the last time you did that?

652
00:43:32.318 --> 00:43:33.319
What you doing?

653
00:43:34.695 --> 00:43:36.280
- Codge...
- Babes, I've gotta go.

654

- To be continued.

655
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:40.343
- I promise, I promise.
- Don't you fucking dare.

656
00:43:40.367 --> 00:43:42.870
Codge, please,
can't you just wait a minute, please?

657
00:43:42.953 --> 00:43:43.954
I'm pregnant.

658
00:43:48.667 --> 00:43:49.667

of thousands years,
all right, pure grafting,

pure sacrifice, yeah?

671
00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:40.761
It's ours, it's the community's.

672

Come on, someone.
Don't think you're gonna get away with it.

675

As much as I love,
and I mean love, cabaret afternoon,

676
00:44:55.317 --> 00:44:57.152
I do believe the deal was to hear you out.

677
00:44:57.236 --> 00:45:00.656
I've done that, Curly,
so, gear. Now.

678
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.660
Yeah, all this nowt out there, okay?
Apart from the unthinkable.

679
00:45:04.743 --> 00:45:07.788
And guess what?
A nine-to-five ain't your bag, mate.

680
00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:11.333
Now this is the only way that we're gonna
save our way of life here, lads, yeah?

681
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.919
We have to be our own cavalry,
Codge, yeah?

682
00:45:14.002 --> 00:45:16.088
And guess what?
I'm not gonna do it without you.

683
00:45:16.171 --> 00:45:18.006
Well, what about you, hmm?

684
00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:20.426
Are you up for robbing
your stepfather to be?

685
00:45:21.009 --> 00:45:22.136
Is it gonna annoy him?

686
00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:24.721
Oh, I should think so, Budge.

687
00:45:24.805 --> 00:45:26.598
Yeah, picture for me, if you will,

688
00:45:26.682 --> 00:45:28.434
the notorious Scarface scene

689
00:45:28.517 --> 00:45:30.936
featuring chainsaw
and lumps of your skull,

690
00:45:31.019 --> 00:45:34.648
slashed brains arcing beautifully
across a plastic shower curtain.

691
00:45:36.108 --> 00:45:37.443
No, I've not seen it.

692
00:45:37.526 --> 00:45:39.963
Don't listen to him, he's probably
sniffed out of his head himself.

693
00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:41.447
- Would you fuck off?
- Fuck off.

694
00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:43.115
Boys! Boys, right?

695
00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:46.952
I've listened to Mr G's plan, okay?
And it's tight.

696
00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:50.789
Now this is nothing compared
to the risks that we take out at sea.

697
00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:53.709
Now, Budgie, are you in?

698
00:45:53.792 --> 00:45:57.546
Come on, any volunteers? Come on.

699
00:45:59.047 --> 00:46:00.299
Come on, anyone?

700
00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:06.180
Yeah, I'm in.

701
00:46:06.763 --> 00:46:10.392
Oh, lovely! Come on up.
Come on, I knew you wouldn't let me down.

702
00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:12.478
That's it, all the way.

703
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:14.396
Come on, don't be shy.

704
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.523
Come on, that's it, hold me hand.

705
00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:19.610
Thank you, someone,
for giving me a hand, lovely.

706
00:46:19.693 --> 00:46:24.072
And I want you to imagine
a room with a clock ticking.

707
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:27.493
- And don't worry…
- Look at me, right?

708
00:46:27.576 --> 00:46:29.745
Mr G has got this all figured out.

709
00:46:29.828 --> 00:46:32.539
Nobody skips a beat,
then we come out of this laughing.

710
00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:35.501
And you're gonna go
further and further into a trance.

711
00:46:35.584 --> 00:46:38.795
Tell Codge how much is in there.
Listen to this.

712
00:46:38.879 --> 00:46:42.382
There is half a mil in cash,
maybe even a mil.

713
00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:44.968
Enough to set up
our own fishing charter company,

714
00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:47.596
maybe even a California branch.

715
00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:49.598
Oh, well, you should have said.

716
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:52.893
The slight problem is,
is that Budgie.

717
00:46:54.102 --> 00:46:55.979
Budgie is our lynchpin.

718
00:46:59.858 --> 00:47:04.238
In what possible world could that…

719
00:47:04.905 --> 00:47:08.367
Oh, look at him go!
He's like Biggles, isn't he?

720
00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:11.954
…be a key player
in a million-pound heist operation?

721
00:47:12.037 --> 00:47:15.249
Budgie's the only one
close enough to Barr to nick his laptop.

722
00:47:15.332 --> 00:47:18.418
Hmm, this is not
exactly what I expected…

723
00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:20.504
Well, this has been fun.

724
00:47:21.213 --> 00:47:25.259
Clearly, you've both gone
a bit fucking coco bananas,

725
00:47:25.342 --> 00:47:27.928
and I am officially out.

726
00:47:29.805 --> 00:47:31.765
Give me my fucking pills, would you?

727
00:47:31.848 --> 00:47:34.726
- I already flushed them, Codge.
- You what?

728
00:47:36.395 --> 00:47:37.813
You're a fucking mess, mate.

729
00:47:37.896 --> 00:47:41.400
…dramatically cooked boats,
this can occur under hypnosis.

730
00:47:41.483 --> 00:47:45.571
Now I did not tell…
Do not wave that around.

731
00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:48.574
Excuse me, everyone, I'm so sorry, right.

732
00:47:48.657 --> 00:47:53.161
Come. Pull that, pull that up.
Okay, lovely, okay, excuse me.

733
00:47:53.245 --> 00:47:55.747
Excuse me, well done, well done,
round of applause.

734
00:47:55.831 --> 00:47:58.166
Come on, pull it up.
Okay, this way.

735
00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:00.168
Ooh, it's like at last weekend.

736
00:48:00.252 --> 00:48:02.421

'Cause we need him back ASAP.

752
00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:31.426
I don't know, to be honest,
it's never actually worked before.

753
00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:34.136
Budgie, mate.

754
00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:37.349
Budgie, you all right?

755
00:49:37.432 --> 00:49:38.558
Anyone in?

756
00:49:41.687 --> 00:49:42.771
Anyone in there?

757
00:49:44.106 --> 00:49:47.442
Don't you think it's weird
how you never see vegetables in the wild?

758
00:49:48.026 --> 00:49:50.320
You got beetroot, parsnips, you know,

759
00:49:50.404 --> 00:49:53.907
I've never seen a cauliflower
on a country walk before, hmm-mm, no.

760
00:49:54.533 --> 00:49:56.868
They've taken them, Curly,
the farmers, they have.

761
00:49:56.952 --> 00:49:58.412
They've enslaved them.

762
00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:02.290
Oh, God, he's hallucinating,
he's psychotic.

763
00:50:02.374 --> 00:50:03.709
Should I call a doctor?

764
00:50:05.168 --> 00:50:06.168
He's all right.

765
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:08.922
Good to have you back, Budgie.

766
00:50:10.298 --> 00:50:11.550
All right, twats.

767
00:50:12.634 --> 00:50:13.634
I'm in.

768
00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:18.473
All right, boys,
there's a few things I need to do

769
00:50:18.557 --> 00:50:19.808
before we can make a move.

770
00:50:19.891 --> 00:50:22.602
So whatever it is that you need to do,
then get it done.

771
00:50:23.311 --> 00:50:25.981
We'll meet in the old pontoon
in just over an hour.

772
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.528
First thing for me to do

773
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:34.281
is disable the motion sensors
in the safe room.

774
00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:36.950
I'll use another member
of staff's override code

775
00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:38.618
to keep our names in the clear.

776
00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:42.247
So after I've silenced the access alarm
and killed the CCTV system,

777
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:44.583
you'll be able to sneak in
without detection.

778
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.336
And remember, boys, not a word to anybody.

779
00:50:51.631 --> 00:50:54.718
- Come in, Mum.
- Hiya, love.

780
00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:57.220
- How did it go?
- Pretty good, thanks.

781
00:50:57.304 --> 00:50:58.889
Not too quick or anything.

782
00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:02.434
I think the wrapper on the condom
helped with the pacing.

783
00:51:10.275 --> 00:51:13.236
What are you gonna do, then?
Take Barr's money or what?

784
00:51:13.862 --> 00:51:16.531
I don't know. What do you think?

785
00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:20.136
Well, if it meant not having to stuff
red snapper in me kegs on payday,

786
00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.328
I know what I'd do.

787
00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:26.374
But it's not my call, Budgie,
this one's on you.

788
00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:31.213
Pitbull! I mean, Demi?

789
00:51:33.298 --> 00:51:36.676
Got a plan, babes.
You're gonna blow a fucking tit off

790
00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.844
when you hear this.

791
00:51:45.393 --> 00:51:46.978
Look, before you say anything, I know.

792
00:51:47.062 --> 00:51:49.022
Look, I shouldn't have left you
and I just…

793
00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:50.816
- Curly, Curly.
- No, no, no, no.

794
00:51:50.899 --> 00:51:53.336
Look, listen, listen, it was a really
shitty thing to do, all right?

795
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.903
And I had a lot
on my mind last night.

796
00:51:54.986 --> 00:51:57.864
Curly, stop, just please stop,
just fucking stop a minute.

797
00:51:57.948 --> 00:51:58.948
What?

798
00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:02.369
I know what Charlie Graham
asked you to do.

799
00:52:03.662 --> 00:52:04.662
I heard him.

800
00:52:05.872 --> 00:52:08.352
I know what you're gonna do with him
and I'm asking you not to.

801
00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:10.895
I seriously don't know
what you're talking about.

802
00:52:10.919 --> 00:52:12.796
Please, I've just been on the server

803
00:52:12.879 --> 00:52:16.716
and someone's just used my ID
to override the CCTV network.

804
00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:20.804
You promised me that
you weren't gonna do anything stupid.

805
00:52:20.887 --> 00:52:22.031
All right, I know I did but...

806
00:52:22.055 --> 00:52:25.058
But what, what?
You just wanted to shag me first?

807
00:52:25.141 --> 00:52:26.434
Oh, that's funny, that is,

808
00:52:26.518 --> 00:52:29.078
because I seem to remember
that you invited me back to your flat.

809
00:52:30.397 --> 00:52:31.690
I'm gonna have to tell Mr Barr.

810
00:52:33.024 --> 00:52:34.234
You do know that, right?

811
00:52:35.026 --> 00:52:38.029
- He's gonna call the police.
- Why are you being so naive?

812
00:52:38.113 --> 00:52:40.216
What, by trying to help you
stay out of trouble, you mean?

813
00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.034
- Oh, this is helping, is it?
- It's theft, Curly.

814
00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:46.681
You know, it's fine for bastards like Barr
to make money out of us, isn't it?

815
00:52:46.705 --> 00:52:48.915
Then all of a sudden we lose our jobs

816
00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:50.792
and he gets to walk away
richer for it, huh?

817
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.479
You know, I consider this
our severance payment.

818
00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:54.963
Doesn't mean you can have it.

819
00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:57.632
Oh, I get what this is.

820
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:01.845
You think he's gonna take you forward
in whatever bullshit plans that he's got.

821
00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.264
You know, we're different, Gilly, okay?

822
00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:06.307
If Barr shuts the company down,
we've got nothing.

823
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:10.186
You're just worried
if we get hold of that money,

824
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:12.397
that's gonna mess up
your glorious fucking career!

825
00:53:15.483 --> 00:53:16.610
You promised.

826
00:53:36.129 --> 00:53:37.505
I've gotta tell him, Demi.

827
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:40.192
They're actually gonna do this,
it's happening while we're sitting here.

828
00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:42.469
All right, all right, all right,
just, uh…

829
00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:45.221
Just wait a minute, please,
put the phone down, please.

830
00:53:45.305 --> 00:53:46.305
What?

831
00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:49.184
All… All I'm saying is,

832
00:53:49.267 --> 00:53:52.312
that maybe we shouldn't be
so hasty about it,

833
00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:54.898
maybe we need to talk through
the pros and cons and that first.

834
00:53:54.981 --> 00:53:57.817
There are no pros, Demi, it's theft.

835
00:53:57.901 --> 00:53:59.778
Mr Barr needs that money.

836
00:53:59.861 --> 00:54:02.781
Really, does he really now?

837
00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:04.824
I ain't buying that.

838
00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:07.202
I've just lost my job, Gilly,
and I'm about to have a kid,

839
00:54:07.285 --> 00:54:09.704
so don't be giving me
a sob story about the owner.

840
00:54:10.372 --> 00:54:13.291
He dropped us lot
faster than fucking hot dog shit.

841
00:54:13.375 --> 00:54:16.711
He's not what you think,
he's trying to make Grimsby better.

842
00:54:16.795 --> 00:54:22.509
Oh, aye, poor old Mr Barr,
what a hero, my arse!

843
00:54:27.889 --> 00:54:32.769
Okay, listen up, just one more time, okay?

844
00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:36.523
Now, phones off right?

845
00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:39.818
We have to get through
three layers of security.

846
00:54:40.694 --> 00:54:44.155
Number one, like I said,
the security guard at the docks.

847
00:54:44.239 --> 00:54:45.365
Codge, that's you.

848
00:54:45.448 --> 00:54:48.827
Number two, the thumbprint access
to the buildings, that's Curly.

849
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:52.414
Now number three,
that's the coded lock to the safe itself.

850
00:54:52.497 --> 00:54:53.832
Yeah, yeah, without which…

851
00:54:53.915 --> 00:54:55.417
None of this could happen.

852
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.836
Exactly, now I don't care
if you're sick of hearing it.

853
00:54:57.919 --> 00:55:00.296
So, when exactly do we hear your role

854
00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:02.298
in the operations, Charles?

855
00:55:02.382 --> 00:55:05.885
Well, you see, I'm what you call
the brains of the operation, son.

856
00:55:05.969 --> 00:55:08.763
Because I'll be the one in the spotlight
when they come a-knocking,

857
00:55:08.847 --> 00:55:11.057
so I have to put as much distance
between myself

858
00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:13.143
and that safe as humanly possible.

859
00:55:13.685 --> 00:55:16.604
Look, he's right,
plus he'll only hold us up.

860
00:55:17.022 --> 00:55:18.940
Yeah, none taken, Curly.

861
00:55:19.024 --> 00:55:22.068
Now if I may be permitted
to continue, Codge.

862
00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:26.948
Now, Mr Barr uses software on his laptop
called Safe Gen. Remember it.

863
00:55:27.615 --> 00:55:31.286
A UPRN is transmitted
to the digital reader on the safe

864
00:55:31.369 --> 00:55:34.330
and the code is reset every 24 hours…

865
00:55:34.414 --> 00:55:37.709
…unless, unless we generate a new code,

866
00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:39.502
which we will,

867
00:55:40.503 --> 00:55:41.546
or Budgie will.

868
00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:45.341
Budgie?

869
00:55:46.217 --> 00:55:47.927
Budgie?

870
00:55:49.345 --> 00:55:51.598
- Sorry, you talking to me?
- Yeah, yeah.

871
00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:55.185
Right, anyway,
that's enough of the team talk.

872
00:55:55.268 --> 00:55:57.604
Budgie, you call me
as soon as you lay hands

873
00:55:57.687 --> 00:55:59.105
on Barr's lappy, all right?

874
00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:00.523
Curly, you're up first.

875
00:56:00.607 --> 00:56:03.860
Wheezy, bez him round to Cass's
then drop Budgie back at his mum's.

876
00:56:03.943 --> 00:56:05.779
I do rat runs all day long, boss.

877
00:56:09.157 --> 00:56:11.117
Now Barr and Budgie's mum stop off

878
00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:14.871
for one at Cass's on the way home
every day like clockwork.

879
00:56:14.954 --> 00:56:17.123
This is our chance
to get Barr's thumbprint.

880
00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:20.752
If his print shows up as the last person
to enter the building, we're in the clear.

881
00:56:20.835 --> 00:56:23.755
Oh, look, Donnie,
there's one of them lazy spas on eBay.

882
00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:26.601
Fancy a bit of that,
don't you, Donnie bear?

883
00:56:27.092 --> 00:56:28.093
Hmm?

884
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:30.011
Donnie!

885
00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:40.688
Ooh, merci me.

886
00:56:41.648 --> 00:56:43.024
Can I take that beer, ducks?

887
00:56:43.108 --> 00:56:45.443
I told you, I'm not done.

888
00:56:45.527 --> 00:56:46.611
No problem.

889
00:56:49.948 --> 00:56:51.825
Come on.

890
00:56:53.451 --> 00:56:55.578
Oh, thought he'd never finish it.

891
00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:57.038
Trev, you're a diamond.

892
00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:59.749
- This never happened now, yeah?
- Say no more.

893
00:56:59.833 --> 00:57:01.793
What's this mischief you're up to then?

894
00:57:01.876 --> 00:57:03.002
You don't wanna know.

895
00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:05.213
You owe me a night out.

896
00:57:05.964 --> 00:57:08.883
Next, Budgie will nab Barr's laptop

897
00:57:08.967 --> 00:57:12.929
from his briefcase,
generate a new code and then replace it,

898
00:57:13.012 --> 00:57:16.132
all in the time it takes for Mr Barr
to play "Hide the Schnitzel" with his mum.

899
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.228
Just remember, Budgie, act normal.

900
00:57:21.646 --> 00:57:24.482
- Oh.
- Hi, Mum, I'm home.

901
00:57:24.566 --> 00:57:26.776
Obviously, where I live
and everything's normal.

902
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.612
Oh, could I take your coat and bag, sir?

903
00:57:29.696 --> 00:57:32.782
No, why don't you go around
to Curly's, love, hmm?

904
00:57:32.866 --> 00:57:35.160
Or put the telly on, loud.

905
00:57:39.998 --> 00:57:40.999
Dipshit.

906
00:58:01.227 --> 00:58:03.104
Hang on,
hang on, hang on, love.

907
00:58:03.188 --> 00:58:04.355
I think, I think…

908
00:58:04.439 --> 00:58:06.816
I think we need
a bit of assistance, Donnie bear.

909
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:07.901
Oh, oh.

910
00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:19.037
Yes, yes, come on!

911
00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:23.374
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, come on.

912
00:58:23.458 --> 00:58:25.752
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

913
00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:28.171
Are you sure you know
what you're doing there, Curls?

914
00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:31.132
I'd say very much
to the contrary, Wheezy.

915
00:58:31.216 --> 00:58:33.056
In fact, it's only in this moment
I've realised

916
00:58:33.092 --> 00:58:35.136
the gossamer thin chance
we have of success.

917
00:58:35.803 --> 00:58:37.847
Yeah, well, fear not, comrades,

918
00:58:38.473 --> 00:58:40.892
we watched a YouTube video,
didn't we, Mr G?

919
00:58:50.652 --> 00:58:53.154
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
it's him, it's him, it's him.

920
00:58:53.238 --> 00:58:56.366
Budgie, Budgie,
tell me you've got the laptop.

921
00:58:56.449 --> 00:58:57.450
Yeah, I've got it.

922
00:58:57.534 --> 00:58:59.536
Thank God.
He's got it, he's got it, he's got it.

923
00:59:00.328 --> 00:59:02.038
It says "please enter password".

924
00:59:02.121 --> 00:59:03.373
You what?

925
00:59:03.456 --> 00:59:05.583
No, Barr doesn't use a password.

926
00:59:05.667 --> 00:59:07.627
Yeah, well, clearly he does, Mr G.

927
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:09.629
Oh! This is well exciting.

928
00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:13.049
No, this can't…
This can't be happening, it can't.

929
00:59:13.132 --> 00:59:16.636
This, this is how it ends, like this.

930
00:59:17.554 --> 00:59:19.114
Fucking hell, I mean,
I was at least hoping

931
00:59:19.138 --> 00:59:20.848
it might end with like a siege,

932
00:59:20.932 --> 00:59:22.559
you know, come out blazing at the cops,

933
00:59:22.642 --> 00:59:24.394
like Butch Cassidy and go.

934
00:59:24.477 --> 00:59:26.312
But not a desktop password! Boys!

935
00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:29.190
Look, I am telling you it didn't have
a password when I checked.

936
00:59:29.274 --> 00:59:33.111
Jesus Christ,
if somebody's blabbed, I swear to God.

937
00:59:33.194 --> 00:59:35.029
Oh, just assume they're onto us,

938
00:59:35.113 --> 00:59:37.824
assume it all, new IDs, plastic surgery!

939
00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:39.242
It's time to disband, boys.

940
00:59:39.325 --> 00:59:40.326
Come on.

941
00:59:40.952 --> 00:59:42.287
Peace out, Girl Scouts.

942
00:59:43.496 --> 00:59:45.206
Okay, everyone, I'm in.

943
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:48.918
The numbers were the hard bit,
just went with one, two, three.

944
00:59:49.002 --> 00:59:50.002
Dipshit was easy.

945
00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:54.007
Yes, yes, yes!

946
00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:56.318
Listen, listen, listen, listen,
settle down, settle down.

947
00:59:56.342 --> 00:59:57.885
Now, Budgie, Budgie, Budgie, Budgie,

948
00:59:57.969 --> 00:59:59.762
listen carefully, all right?

949
00:59:59.846 --> 01:00:04.934
Now double click on the icon
which says "Safe Gen", all right?

950
01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:08.980
Now open up the app
and press "generate new".

951
01:00:10.815 --> 01:00:12.358
Whoa!

952
01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:17.905
Okay, right, now give me
the last eight digits. Go ahead.

953
01:00:19.824 --> 01:00:25.163
- Nine-four-two-one-four-three…
- Yep.

954
01:00:25.246 --> 01:00:26.414
Six-three.

955
01:00:27.373 --> 01:00:29.083
Okay, last one.

956
01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:33.838
Press the button
which says "send code to safe".

957
01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:42.638
I did it.

958
01:00:43.848 --> 01:00:45.308
Curly, Curly, I did it!

959
01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:48.144
It says "code successfully sent to safe".

960
01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:53.483
Yes, yes, yes!

961
01:00:53.566 --> 01:00:56.235
Okay, good man.
Now, listen to me, listen to me carefully.

962
01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:59.572
You've gotta get that laptop back
where it came from fast, all right?

963
01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.407
Wheezy's gonna come back for you now.

964
01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.492
Yes, yes!

965
01:01:02.575 --> 01:01:04.118
Good lad, I'll speak to you soon.

966
01:01:11.876 --> 01:01:13.753
Yes, come on, come on.

967
01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.797
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

968
01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:21.260
Oh, yeah!

969
01:01:23.137 --> 01:01:26.140
Come on!

970
01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:28.893
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

971
01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:33.940
Oh, I've got the lazy spa!
Half bloody price and all, Donnie bear!

972
01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:42.615
This is it, lads.

973
01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:46.244
All we have to do is blag our way
onto the docks without causing a stir.

974
01:01:47.328 --> 01:01:49.122
Kev's as bent as a nine bob note

975
01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:52.583
and Codge's has had
dealings with him, shall we say.

976
01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:54.419
The point is to distract him

977
01:01:54.502 --> 01:01:57.964
so he doesn't question Wheezy too much
as he drives onto the docks.

978
01:01:58.923 --> 01:02:04.053
- Now then, Codge-o, you crackhead.
- Salutations, K-man.

979
01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.681
I've chuff all for you, son.

980
01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:10.017
Waiting on a Russki tanker to get in.
You'll have to come back.

981
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:12.270
See, that's where you're all wrong, sir,

982
01:02:12.353 --> 01:02:15.815
'cause today I have got something for you.

983
01:02:16.649 --> 01:02:21.112
Say hello to mama shagman.

984
01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:22.363
Chuff me.

985
01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:25.783
Ah, ah, ah, ah, careful now, K-man,

986
01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:30.872
she nips like a rescue donkey
with a sore arse.

987
01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.291
What is this amateur hour?

988
01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:35.460
Come round.

989
01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.549
Codge might well be doing this

990
01:02:41.632 --> 01:02:43.885
to get off his fucking tits
for the next six months.

991
01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:45.595
But not Curly.

992
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.390
Curly Dean thinks he's some kind
of Robin frigging Hood or something.

993
01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:53.394
He's probably doing this for some big idea
of how to save Grimsby.

994
01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:57.982
I know he's full of himself
but his heart's in the right place

995
01:02:58.691 --> 01:03:01.986
and I know Codge is a fucking crack head

996
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:06.115
but I don't want my kid's father in prison
before it's even born.

997
01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:18.211
You all right, boys?

998
01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:22.840
No, Budgie's farting…
It's like fucking petrol!

999
01:03:22.924 --> 01:03:25.009
I'm nervous, that's all.

1000
01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:30.014
Call the boys, now!

1001
01:03:30.097 --> 01:03:32.141
Oh, fuck. Okay, okay.

1002
01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:40.775
Codge! Codge!

1003
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.528
Co…

1004
01:03:56.916 --> 01:03:58.000
How's your man?

1005
01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.211
He poses no threat, Wheezy.

1006
01:04:00.586 --> 01:04:03.422
All it took was a soupçon of four stroke.

1007
01:04:04.632 --> 01:04:07.343
Clever. You got a horse, have you?

1008
01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:21.816
All right, what do I do now?

1009
01:04:21.899 --> 01:04:24.193
Just do whatever getaway drivers do
when they're waiting

1010
01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:26.571
- to get away, yeah?
- Ten-four, copy that.

1011
01:04:26.988 --> 01:04:30.449
Drive up and down looking for customers,
regular day at the office.

1012
01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.326
Mate, what's all this about?

1013
01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:35.329
It's experience, mate.
You can break into Fort Knox

1014
01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:38.499
with that green shit on,
no one would bat an eyelid.

1015
01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:39.876
True that.

1016
01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:43.045
All right, we'll buzz you
when we're ready to get out, yeah?

1017
01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:46.883
- What's in the rucksack?
- Snacks.

1018
01:04:59.478 --> 01:05:03.065
Oh, God, bollocks, chuff me!

1019
01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:09.238
Kevin, everything okay?

1020
01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:13.492
Yeah, yeah, yeah, everything's fine,
just wrapping up for the night.

1021
01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:16.078
You lock up on your way out.

1022
01:05:52.406 --> 01:05:56.285
See, Mr G's turned the CCTV off
just like he said he would.

1023
01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:58.955
Budgie, you stay here
and give look out, yeah?

1024
01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:00.414
Codge, come on.

1025
01:06:16.597 --> 01:06:19.141
- Press again.
- Fuck, man!

1026
01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:21.477
I smudged it.

1027
01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.981
- Fuck! Codge, I fucking smudged it.
- Press again.

1028
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:27.358
- Press again.
- Fucking work!

1029
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:38.577
Curly, the police are coming!

1030
01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.538
Press again.

1031
01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.834
Ah, fuck!

1032
01:06:47.044 --> 01:06:48.462
Fucking hell!

1033
01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:51.716
Verified. Thank you.

1034
01:07:02.768 --> 01:07:05.104
- Budgie, what the actual fuck?
- I know.

1035
01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:08.024
Mr Barr had me in the offices for a bit
before I came to sea with you.

1036
01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:10.502
- I must still be in the system.
- Yeah, what, an office life,

1037
01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.361
- it didn't work out you, no?
- Look, Curly,

1038
01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.256
Mr Barr is gonna know
it's me from my thumbprint.

1039
01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.240
Curly, I don't wanna go to prison.

1040
01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:17.992
Budgie, no one's going to jail.

1041
01:07:18.075 --> 01:07:21.454
All right, we're gonna destroy
the security systems on our way out.

1042
01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:24.665
Look, I promise you, okay? Come on.

1043
01:08:02.995 --> 01:08:06.082
Hey, what if it's empty after all this?

1044
01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:17.301
Six, three, nine, four,

1045
01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:22.389
two, one, four, six, three.

1046
01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.310
This is it, boys.

1047
01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:37.488
Fucking hell!

1048
01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.172
I'll call the Wheez Machine.

1049
01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:59.760
- Curly, don't forget the fingerprints.
- Yeah, good point, Budgie.

1050
01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:02.513
When did you get all heist savvy?

1051
01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:19.530
Budgie!

1052
01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.782
- Anything?
- No, the same.

1053
01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:23.576
They've turned them all off.

1054
01:09:24.076 --> 01:09:26.412
Give me the keys. Well, come on.

1055
01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:36.046
Budgie, just open the door.

1056
01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:38.382
- I can't.
- Why not?

1057
01:09:38.465 --> 01:09:41.194
- Because I can't let you do this.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1058
01:09:41.218 --> 01:09:43.721
Look, I'm just gonna take the money,
back to Mr Barr,

1059
01:09:43.804 --> 01:09:45.514
and nobody is gonna go to prison.

1060
01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.766
I'm trying to save you, Codge, all right?

1061
01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.477
I cannot risk losing you, right,
not both of you.

1062
01:09:50.561 --> 01:09:53.480
Budgie, no one is gonna get caught.

1063
01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:56.567
Fucking hell. Queenie said
this was better than my idea.

1064
01:09:56.650 --> 01:10:00.613
Open this fucking door right fucking now!

1065
01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:03.949
I was just gonna set fire to it,
then nobody, right, can have it.

1066
01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:06.785
Queenie said that might be dangerous.
I'm gonna do this.

1067
01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:09.622
Budgie, that's a really
stupid idea, all right?

1068
01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:13.959
Just open the door, yeah, and then
we can all walk out of here scot-free.

1069
01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:17.046
All right, my finger opened the door,
all right?

1070
01:10:17.129 --> 01:10:18.631
I'm on the system, all right?

1071
01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:21.050
So they're gonna link me
to you and to Codge.

1072
01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:25.721
Budgie, I swear,
if you don't open this door

1073
01:10:25.804 --> 01:10:30.059
- in the next five seconds!
- Don't do this, Budge.

1074
01:10:30.142 --> 01:10:33.771
I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry, Curly.

1075
01:10:37.858 --> 01:10:39.068
Budgie?

1076
01:10:42.446 --> 01:10:44.240
Budgie, mate,
what was that sound?

1077
01:10:45.699 --> 01:10:48.327
You mean, that clicky shotgun
sort of sound?

1078
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:50.120
Yes, Budge.

1079
01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:53.249
What was it, Budge?

1080
01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.889
Oh, well, come on then, boys,
I'll need your phones.

1081
01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:12.518
Don't know what? I always thought
there was a bit good left in you, Mr G,

1082
01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:15.479
after you traded your honour
for a life on the high seas

1083
01:11:15.562 --> 01:11:18.315
to shine your little arse
on your office chair,

1084
01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:21.235
but, alas, you have proved me wrong.

1085
01:11:21.318 --> 01:11:22.945
Well, when you get to my age,

1086
01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:25.239
then maybe you can lecture me
on good or bad,

1087
01:11:25.322 --> 01:11:27.162
but do you know what?
You've barely lived, son!

1088
01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:29.660
- Ah, ah, ah.
- What's wrong with you?

1089
01:11:29.743 --> 01:11:32.037
Mr Graham,
it's raised my blood sugar there.

1090
01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:35.749
I need a snack, I've got some
Mars bars in my bag, please.

1091
01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:37.334
Mars bars.

1092
01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.963
Well, go on then hurry up.
I said hurry up!

1093
01:11:41.046 --> 01:11:43.924
You know what? You're gonna
go down for this, Mr G,

1094
01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.808
'cause I'm gonna tell Barr
fucking everything.

1095
01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:48.470
Yeah, well, you know,
you can tell him all of that

1096
01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:50.931
but my guess is that that swag is so hot,

1097
01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:54.059
that he'll not wanna squeak
to anybody about it.

1098
01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:55.870
You think she's gonna come back
to you, do you?

1099
01:11:55.894 --> 01:11:58.230
Now you've got a few bob back
in your pocket?

1100
01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:01.400
Yeah, oh, she's going nowhere, man.

1101
01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:05.571
I've heard her new bloke
is rigged like a fucking moose.

1102
01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.781
Do you know what?
You think you're so much smarter

1103
01:12:07.865 --> 01:12:10.576
than everybody else,
but I've got news for you,

1104
01:12:10.659 --> 01:12:13.954
you see all this, this is all mine, right?

1105
01:12:14.038 --> 01:12:16.915
I'm going out with a bang, old chum,

1106
01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:20.461
reward for a lifelong
of fucking drudgery!

1107
01:12:20.544 --> 01:12:22.713
Oh, such a noble cause, Mr G!

1108
01:12:22.796 --> 01:12:25.632
Well, we are who we are, ain't we?

1109
01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:29.720
And I know what I am, I know
who I am, unlike you, Curly.

1110
01:12:29.803 --> 01:12:31.889
You're just searching for an identity

1111
01:12:31.972 --> 01:12:35.309
and you've opted for a lukewarm
version of your old man

1112
01:12:35.392 --> 01:12:40.022
but deep down you know as well as I do
that Teapot was the real deal

1113
01:12:40.105 --> 01:12:44.193
and you, you're just playing at it, son.

1114
01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.237
Do it, Budge.

1115
01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:48.364
Pardon me, Mr G.

1116
01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:57.331
All right, you bastards,
get in there now!

1117
01:12:57.414 --> 01:12:58.707
You little bastards!

1118
01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.293
Move, get in there now.

1119
01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:05.297
Get in there now. Now!

1120
01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:16.225
Goofy little twat!

1121
01:13:16.308 --> 01:13:19.853
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
- Don't, don't, don't mess with me!

1122
01:13:22.689 --> 01:13:23.982
Shit.

1123
01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:29.822
- Twat!
- No, no.

1124
01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:31.281
What's that smell?

1125
01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:34.618
Is that smoke?

1126
01:13:34.701 --> 01:13:36.954
No way! He's… he's fucking
torching the place.

1127
01:13:37.037 --> 01:13:38.914
Open the door!

1128
01:13:38.997 --> 01:13:41.083
Open the fucking door!

1129
01:13:44.878 --> 01:13:47.297
Open the fucking door!

1130
01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:49.550
Open the fucking door!

1131
01:13:49.633 --> 01:13:51.135
Open the door!

1132
01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:56.932
The fucking door, open the fucking door!

1133
01:14:01.019 --> 01:14:03.939
- Open the door, Mr G!
- Open the door!

1134
01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:07.276
Mr G, open the fucking door!

1135
01:14:07.359 --> 01:14:09.820
Open the fucking door!

1136
01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:29.214
Please, Mr G., fucking help us.

1137
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:45.022
Fucking help.

1138
01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.796
Demi! We've gotta get there quickly!

1139
01:15:24.394 --> 01:15:27.606
So after all the times we thought
we'd never make it home,

1140
01:15:29.441 --> 01:15:32.319
we die in a little stupid
room in the office.

1141
01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:39.826
Demi's pregnant, boys.

1142
01:15:43.413 --> 01:15:45.290
She's pregnant.

1143
01:15:46.124 --> 01:15:47.292
It's me.

1144
01:15:53.006 --> 01:15:55.050
I was gonna be a dad, Curly.

1145
01:15:57.135 --> 01:15:59.137
Don't say that, Codge.

1146
01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:05.394
Don't you fucking dare say that, Codge.

1147
01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:24.538
Hey, Codge, Demi's gonna
raise that kid so good.

1148
01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:32.170
Thanks, Budge.

1149
01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:39.803
Tell us about the dream, Codge, eh?

1150
01:16:41.138 --> 01:16:43.432
Where it is and everything?

1151
01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:48.020
So…

1152
01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:53.275
we take a skiff out to paradise.

1153
01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:58.322
I tap up all the tourists in Santa Cruz.

1154
01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:03.910
We're on a skiff, fifty bucks a go,

1155
01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:07.456
rods and reels thrown in.

1156
01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.459
Weighted 20 pound lines.

1157
01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:15.881
Congenial fucking sunshine.

1158
01:17:16.381 --> 01:17:21.928
And just the faintest little whiff…

1159
01:17:22.846 --> 01:17:28.393
Of tanned California fanny.

1160
01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:40.030
You hold fast to that dream, Codge.

1161
01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:44.660
Hold fast.

1162
01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:58.757
My dear brothers and sisters
in Christ,

1163
01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:03.595
we are gathered here today
to celebrate the life

1164
01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:06.723
of a beloved son of Grimsby.

1165
01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:12.312
And it is on this day,
with love in our heart

1166
01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:16.692
and sadness in our soul,
that we bid our last farewell

1167
01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:20.779
to this man who had a zest for life.

1168
01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:26.118
Dearly beloved of his many friends
and relations

1169
01:18:27.327 --> 01:18:30.163
and to the last fibre of his being,

1170
01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:34.042
a trawlerman.

1171
01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:38.171
I didn't want change

1172
01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:41.550
but maybe change is the only thing
we can rely on in this world.

1173
01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:46.763
The planet spins at 1,000 miles an hour

1174
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:50.767
and you can't do a thing about it.

1175
01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:10.454
The best you can hope for is someone
to hold onto as it spins.

1176
01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:24.050
To the ocean we are born
and to the ocean we must return.

1177
01:19:44.362 --> 01:19:46.782
Why did they call him Teapot?

1178
01:19:48.074 --> 01:19:49.493
Because me mum…

1179
01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:55.207
she hit him over the head
with a porcelain teapot the day she left.

1180
01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:02.756
That's why he wore that
old wig to cover the scar.

1181
01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:08.345
Probably deserved it.

1182
01:20:13.183 --> 01:20:15.185
What are you gonna do?

1183
01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:20.232
Job-wise, I don't know,

1184
01:20:22.567 --> 01:20:23.902
Macy or a brew,

1185
01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:27.489
maybe a coffee shop
will have me or something.

1186
01:20:28.573 --> 01:20:30.450
Doesn't sound like you.

1187
01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.043
Have you got a minute, Curly?

1188
01:20:43.129 --> 01:20:45.924
You're right, you know, things change

1189
01:20:46.007 --> 01:20:48.009
and you have to find a way to move on.

1190
01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:52.389
I'm just angry, I suppose, you know?

1191
01:20:54.224 --> 01:20:57.602
It's just everything's related
to the fishing industry's

1192
01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:59.855
got my dad's face on it and I just…

1193
01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:03.024
find it hard to move on, you know?

1194
01:21:03.108 --> 01:21:04.818
I understand.

1195
01:21:05.902 --> 01:21:07.654
Thanks for turning up.

1196
01:21:07.737 --> 01:21:10.323
I reckon if you hadn't
you'd be scattering my ashes

1197
01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:12.033
out there and all by now.

1198
01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:14.327
You might be a bit of a scoundrel,

1199
01:21:14.411 --> 01:21:16.663
but I couldn't let you burn
for that now, could I?

1200
01:21:27.173 --> 01:21:29.885
Turns out Gilly's not quite
the management suck-up I thought.

1201
01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:33.763
- Demi, look.
- Fuck!

1202
01:21:38.351 --> 01:21:39.853
- Charlie!
- Gilly, thank God.

1203
01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:42.856
Thank God. I was just
closing up and this thing.

1204
01:21:42.939 --> 01:21:45.483
Just cut the bullshit, Mr G,
where's Codge?

1205
01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:49.404
They're all inside!
Look, I tried to save them, I did.

1206
01:21:49.487 --> 01:21:51.948
I must have turned off
the fire alarm with the CCTV.

1207
01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:53.617
Come on, come on.

1208
01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:55.243
- Fucking hell.
- Demi, it's not safe!

1209
01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:58.288
- Open the fucking doors, Gilly!
- I've got a better idea.

1210
01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.596
Come on then, help me!

1211
01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:20.518
Oi, leave that, put that back!

1212
01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:24.940
Hey, hey, put that back,
put that back now!

1213
01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:26.775
Hey!

1214
01:22:36.701 --> 01:22:39.079
- Come on, Wheezy!
- I'm on it, Gilly.

1215
01:22:39.162 --> 01:22:41.456
Get them out of here fast!

1216
01:22:41.539 --> 01:22:43.750
Codge, get up! Get up, Codge!

1217
01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:47.253
Get up, get up, Codge! Get in the car!

1218
01:22:57.055 --> 01:23:00.934
Wait! What about me? Help, help me!

1219
01:23:02.018 --> 01:23:05.021
So, Curly Dean, tell me,

1220
01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:08.358
what do you think we should do with it?

1221
01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:19.244
Ah, Miss Divine,
how lovely to see you again.

1222
01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.329
He's just in there.

1223
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:27.168
Grimsby has a long and rich
industrial heritage.

1224
01:23:28.086 --> 01:23:31.840
A mutual beneficial partnership
with the North Sea

1225
01:23:32.424 --> 01:23:35.677
and the winds that once
powered our finest fleet

1226
01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.053
of fishing vessels.

1227
01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:41.474
Mr Barr, there's no future in
a fishing net, we talked about this.

1228
01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:50.942
What is this?

1229
01:23:51.651 --> 01:23:54.988
Hundreds of thousands of square feet

1230
01:23:55.071 --> 01:23:58.366
of seafood packaging premises, hmm?

1231
01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.285
Oh, best of all,

1232
01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:05.081
the largest wind turbine
manufacturing plant

1233
01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:07.292
on the planet, hmm?

1234
01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:12.297
Free power, subsidized almost entirely
by Mr Chancellor's purse.

1235
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:18.511
We all must do our best, Miss Divine.

1236
01:24:19.095 --> 01:24:24.309
Oh, I see.
Okay, Mr Barr, you've made your point.

1237
01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:27.353
You can see the pissing politician
back to Whitehall now.

1238
01:24:27.437 --> 01:24:31.941
I'm prepared to revisit
the profit share. How much?

1239
01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:39.657
You still don't get it do you, huh?

1240
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:46.247
What good is money
without power, Miss Divine?

1241
01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:50.668
Now if I go along with your scheme,
I'll make a quick profit, sure,

1242
01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:56.049
but my influence in the town,
oh, will be mediocre at best.

1243
01:24:56.633 --> 01:25:01.262
Whereas with this….
Yes!

1244
01:25:01.346 --> 01:25:04.015
This will be my empire and all this,

1245
01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:07.393
with limitless wind in my sails.

1246
01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:12.273
I will become more powerful
than you can ever imagine.

1247
01:25:13.066 --> 01:25:16.861
Sustaining communities
and reaping the rewards

1248
01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.780
from generation to generation.

1249
01:25:19.656 --> 01:25:24.244
Known around the world,
the townspeople will worship me.

1250
01:25:25.328 --> 01:25:30.750
My name will be whispered at every door
in the halls of power.

1251
01:25:31.584 --> 01:25:35.797
Oh, and not only that, not only…

1252
01:25:38.716 --> 01:25:39.968
Miss Divine?

1253
01:25:40.051 --> 01:25:43.721
Mr Barr, what are you doing?

1254
01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:51.729
Well, make it quick, Gilly,
I have The Telegraph coming in.

1255
01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:55.150
They want to interview
the man who's putting Grimsby

1256
01:25:55.233 --> 01:25:56.776
back on the map.

1257
01:26:00.655 --> 01:26:04.492
- Me.
- Ah, of course.

1258
01:26:09.289 --> 01:26:14.002
Mr Barr, it was actually
me who wanted to speak to you.

1259
01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:18.590
Oh, well, get on with it, lad.

1260
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:26.848
Mr Barr, look it was me...

1261
01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:30.351
Mr Barr, we just both
wanted to say good luck

1262
01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:33.479
with your new venture.

1263
01:26:33.563 --> 01:26:37.692
Well then, we'll need plenty of
hard workers so keep in touch, Curly.

1264
01:26:37.775 --> 01:26:39.527
- I don't think you understand…
- No.

1265
01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:41.988
- I don't think you...
- No, come on, come on.

1266
01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:47.285
Gilly, just a minute.

1267
01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:53.416
Yes, Mr Barr?

1268
01:26:53.499 --> 01:26:57.045
I just wanted to have a quick chat
if you have the time,

1269
01:26:59.839 --> 01:27:01.466
about the cash.

1270
01:27:04.677 --> 01:27:06.054
Cash?

1271
01:27:06.137 --> 01:27:11.726
Yes, the cash that that terrible Charlie
tried to steal from us.

1272
01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:18.566
The cash that unfortunately
perished in the fire

1273
01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:21.486
as cash indeed would.

1274
01:27:22.946 --> 01:27:24.405
Mr Barr?

1275
01:27:25.698 --> 01:27:28.451
I just thought you'd be
interested to know

1276
01:27:28.534 --> 01:27:31.579
the insurer's paid out
in full on the building.

1277
01:27:32.872 --> 01:27:34.624
In fact, we've made a bit of a killing.

1278
01:27:35.333 --> 01:27:36.834
That's a relief, Mr Barr.

1279
01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:39.087
Yes, isn't it?

1280
01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:43.132
Winners all around.

1281
01:27:51.849 --> 01:27:53.142
Are you all right, Gilly?

1282
01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:56.646
- Yeah, yeah, I think so.
- What's happening?

1283
01:27:56.729 --> 01:28:00.566
It's just I thought you said me confessing
was the right thing to do.

1284
01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:10.285
I just… I wanted to know
that you would, needed, so…

1285
01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:21.045
Come in.

1286
01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:29.095
- Mr Barr.
- Huh?

1287
01:28:29.178 --> 01:28:30.430
I wanted to let you know

1288
01:28:30.513 --> 01:28:32.890
we recovered some more data
from the access log.

1289
01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:38.980
There's one entry an hour before
Gilly Simpson's thumbprint.

1290
01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:40.231
Who's?

1291
01:28:43.609 --> 01:28:45.153
Daniel Budgel.

1292
01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:50.074
Dipshit.

1293
01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:08.843
I'm just gonna…

1294
01:29:26.110 --> 01:29:31.115
♪ One of these days
I'm gonna tell you about ♪

1295
01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:36.871
Well, what I've learned is
that I am utterly powerless

1296
01:29:36.954 --> 01:29:38.623
in the face of my addiction.

1297
01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:40.500
I've…

1298
01:29:43.127 --> 01:29:47.924
I've lied to the people I love.

1299
01:29:48.966 --> 01:29:53.679
Yet for some reason or another,
I got another chance,

1300
01:29:55.932 --> 01:29:57.850
and I'm not gonna waste it.

1301
01:29:59.352 --> 01:30:00.353
Not today.

1302
01:30:17.328 --> 01:30:21.332
Yeah, yeah, that is brilliant.
Bitcoin's perfect for us.

1303
01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:22.625
Yeah.

1304
01:30:22.708 --> 01:30:27.547
It's tempting, mate,
but I'm trying to make amends.

1305
01:30:28.714 --> 01:30:31.342
I'm not really sure
this is how you go about it.

1306
01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:34.762
Demi don't wanna know me.

1307
01:30:35.638 --> 01:30:38.099
The least I can do is
be around for the kid.

1308
01:30:38.724 --> 01:30:40.726
Well, you're not gonna be, are you?

1309
01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:44.188
You see if the kid's with Demi
and Demi's with us,

1310
01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:45.815
crushing it in Santa Cruz,

1311
01:30:46.649 --> 01:30:49.527
then how are you gonna be
a nan for the kid?

1312
01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:53.156
Can you find your balls, then,
or do you want me to have a look?

1313
01:30:54.615 --> 01:30:56.325
There's room for one more in here.

1314
01:31:02.498 --> 01:31:06.252
So, what do you reckon, mate?
We're gonna go and live the life?

♪ I've pictured a rainbow ♪

1316
01:31:22.518 --> 01:31:25.313
We couldn't save
the fishing industry in Grimsby.

1317
01:31:25.396 --> 01:31:26.856
No one could.

1318
01:31:26.939 --> 01:31:30.943
See, truth be told, it's a miracle
the boss took it out for so long.

1319
01:31:31.027 --> 01:31:34.739
And to the man's credit, Barr really did
put Grimsby back on the map,

1320
01:31:35.198 --> 01:31:37.742
its turbine manufacturing extravaganza

1321
01:31:37.825 --> 01:31:40.912
bringing joy, money and merriment
back to the shores

1322
01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:42.413
of old Grim once again.

1323
01:31:42.496 --> 01:31:46.500
And again, you can walk along the boats
from one side of Grimsby to the other.

1324
01:31:46.584 --> 01:31:48.628
Albeit on them glorified life rafts

1325
01:31:48.711 --> 01:31:51.756
