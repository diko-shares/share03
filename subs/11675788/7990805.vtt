00:00:01.024 --> 00:00:03.691
(western music)

2
00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:48.674
- [Curly] Ah, Grimsby.

3
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.993
Finest fish dock in all the world.

4
00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:54.958
Born out of nothing
when our Viking friend,

5
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.843
Old Grim, landed ashore
looking to snag a few eels.

6
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.558
Industry arrived, and before we knew,

7
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.508
it went from being a tiny
little fishing village

8
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.163
to the largest port in the world.

9
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.585
Boats by the hundreds,

10
00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:09.718
thousands upon thousands of Trawlermen,

11
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.728
fish caught by the billion.

12
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.588
You couldn't move there
was so many Trawlermen

13
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.688
back on land in their new tailored suits,

14
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.338
and their Creeper boots.

15
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.658
Money was everywhere.

16
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.878
The whole town awash with cash.

17
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.328
Grimsby was thriving, rocking,

18
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.868
but then rather quickly,
it all went to ship.

19
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.548
- [Newsreader] Bowing
under American pressure,

20
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.278
Crossland has agreed to a 200 mile

21
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.258
exclusion zone around Iceland,

22
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.208
effectively killing the fishing industry.

23
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.648
- [Presenter] Since the
end of the Cod Wars,

24
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.988
Grimsby's port has gone
from housing hundreds of

25
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.048
independent trawling
companies to just two.

26
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.098
- [Interviewer] With the closure this week

27
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.358
of Ernie Sampson Trawling.

28
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.338
- [Newsreader] Star
Fisheries owner Donald Barr

29
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.401
looks today to host what
could be a do or die meeting.

30
00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:51.898
- [Donald] Sell the land as part

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.273
of the town's redevelopment program.

32
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:57.594
(screaming)

33
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.808
- That's me, Curly Dean.

34
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.753
5'11, and 160 pounds of Grimsby's finest.

35
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.953
So what does a man who has
it all dream about, you ask?

36
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.938
Handsome bastard, tick.

37
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.228
Charming, tick.

38
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.688
Minted, tick,

39
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.008
tick, tick.

40
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.948
Well, I will be once we
flog this ice packed bounty

41
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.888
of soon to be battered
and deep fried aquatics.

42
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.768
The main thing you need to know
about the common Trawlerman

43
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.658
is we're not like other folk.

44
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.978
We're freaks.

45
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.008
We risk life and limb, make big bank,

46
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.718
then set fire to it.

47
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.208
We live like death's
always round the corner.

48
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.210
That's 'cause it is.

49
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.058
What you're looking at here
is one of a dying breed.

50
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.288
Trawlermen.

51
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.818
Son of Trawlerman.

52
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.783
Son of Trawlerman.

53
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.448
This is a man with fish in his bones.

54
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.350
With more than two sheets in the wind.

55
00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:54.268
This is a man with sea-water
coursing through his veins,

56
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.125
like a rare hooky vodka.

57
00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:57.838
(tense music)

58
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.673
Now, I know.

59
00:02:59.532 --> 00:03:02.368
You're thinking, this
fisherman's rather tasty.

60
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.568
Fetching.

61
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.718
Not entirely without a
certain joie-de-vivre.

62
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.668
Whereas young Budgie here,

63
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.408
you're thinking this boy
could only be half man,

64
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.358
half milkshake on a good day.

65
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.193
Am I right?

66
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.198
- [Budgie] Ah!

67
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.448
- [Curly] Old Budgie's not
really cut out for life at sea.

68
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.828
He's not really cut out for life.

69
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.778
He only really got this gig 'cause his mam

70
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.298
wants him out the house while
she's belly-bumping Mr Barr,

71
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.788
A.K.A The Big Boss.

72
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.798
That said, Budgie does bring his own

73
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.450
unique skillset to the workplace?

74
00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:34.498
- Curls, I had this well weird dream.

75
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.738
Mr Barr was operating
on me while I was awake.

76
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.868
He swapped my eyes with my balls.

77
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.865
I could see inside my scrotum.

78
00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:42.929
- Come here, mate.

79
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:43.931
Bring it in.

80
00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:48.546
This is what I mean.

81
00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:49.631
- [Budgie] Oh, giz us a look.

82
00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:50.800
Giz us a look!

83
00:03:51.783 --> 00:03:54.025
- We're home, Budgie boy.

84
00:03:54.027 --> 00:03:55.473
The best place on earth.

85
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.878
Welcome, fuckers,

86
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.783

99
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.638
you could walk across the Trawlers

100
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.798
from one side of Grimsby to the other.

101
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.748
You see, Trawlermen like my dad

102
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.668
were rock stars once upon a time.

103
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.728
Screwed by the Tories,
ridiculed by the liberals.

104
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.838
We've been sold down river more

105
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.908
than once since the glory days.

106
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.288
But mark my words,

107
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.463
Grimsby will reemerge from
the depths like a sperm whale,

108
00:05:10.465 --> 00:05:12.298
or like your old man in a bubble bath.

109
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.153
Magnificent boner glistening
in the foam and spray.

110
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.048
So say it once, say it loud,

111
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.188
and say it firm.

112
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.448
To the ocean we are born,

113
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.100
and to the ocean we shall return.

114
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.548
- Don't blow it all at once.

115
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.618
I've not had a sail time for Monday yet,

116
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.658
but when I do, you'll know.

117
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.038
And spare a thought for your Skipper

118
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.138
while you're getting off your tits.

119
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.658
I'm waiting on a call
from Mr. Barr himself.

120
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.368
- Expanding the fleet, isn't he?

121
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.201
- [Captain] All right.

122
00:05:39.203 --> 00:05:40.034
Calm down, calm down.

123
00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:41.938
- So can I tell Codge he's
gonna get his old job back then?

124
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.018
We're gonna need more hands on deck

125
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.278
when things start taking off again.

126
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.768
- You tell that scrob
he'll get his old job back

127
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.970
when he jacks it in
with them bastard drugs.

128
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.358
- It's true.

129
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.548
Codge does have bloody-type amphetamine.

130
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.258
But what can I say?

131
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.998
Albeit addicted to any and every

132
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.368
substance gracing the periodic table,

133
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.808
he's a shipmate.

134
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.158
We grew up together.

135
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.628
Threw up together.

136
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.728
- If you must know, there's
a big deal on the table,

137
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.688
so I've heard.

138
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.568
And if it's ought worth
knowing, you'll find out.

139
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.530
Right, get the fuck off my vessel you lot.

three day millionaire,

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.338
home means three things for three days.

146
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.828
Money, merriment,

147
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.208
and if you lucky enough,

148
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.638
a brief but exotic STD,

149
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.540
previously unknown to medical science.

150
00:06:39.324 --> 00:06:42.407
(seagulls squawking)

151
00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:50.429
- Woohoo!

152
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.083
The Arctic Ranger returns.

153
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.500
Cold enough for you, was it?

154
00:07:04.363 --> 00:07:07.154
(Budgie laughing)

155
00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:09.421
- [Budgie] Come on.

156
00:07:09.423 --> 00:07:11.128
- Spoke to Alfy Glassel again.

157
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.438
He's snagging a ton a
day out the Monterey.

158
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.568
Says California is where we need to be.

159
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.788
He's dragging Rockfish over the side.

160
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.335
Halibut, but he's saying it's

161
00:07:19.337 --> 00:07:21.094
like you wouldn't believe.

162
00:07:21.096 --> 00:07:22.780
$200 a piece.

163
00:07:22.782 --> 00:07:24.461
- 200 you say?

164
00:07:24.463 --> 00:07:25.918
- 30 pound Lings.

165
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.386
Albacore Tuna!

166
00:07:27.388 --> 00:07:30.680
(cheers) Giddee up, Budge.

167
00:07:30.682 --> 00:07:31.735
- Are you actually gonna do it, Codge?

168
00:07:31.737 --> 00:07:33.628
Are you actually really gonna go one day?

169
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.372
- Budgie, Alf says the
sun shines every day.

170
00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:39.688
But not too hot.

171
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:40.521
Just--

172
00:07:40.523 --> 00:07:42.293
- Congenial spring sunshine.

173
00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.348
- Yes!

174
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.008
Congenial fucking sunshine.

175
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.508
- With just the faintest little whiff

176
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.358
of tanned California fanny.

177
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.360
- Yes, the very grandest
of all Canyons I might add.

178
00:07:56.588 --> 00:07:59.687
- Mate, I don't mean to
piss on your bonfire,

179
00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:03.066
but California is a
million miles away, more.

180
00:08:03.068 --> 00:08:05.458
- Curly, this place is done.

181
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.308
Grimsby is as dead as frigging
dead whelks and crab shite.

182
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.328
I'm telling you.

183
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.128
- I can see how one might
draw up that conclusion,

184
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.033
Codge, all right?

185
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.938
But the glory days are coming back.

186
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.323
They are coming back!

187
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.068
Listen, mon Frere.

188
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.439
Barr's in with the bankers right now.

189
00:08:20.441 --> 00:08:21.434
Grimsby's on the up.

190
00:08:21.436 --> 00:08:23.578
Soon this place is gonna be
wall to wall with Trawlers.

191
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.718
Budgie, tell the guy.

192
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.029
Am I right?

193
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:26.963
- Oh yeah.

194
00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.318
Honestly, oh yeah.

195
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.938
- You know what?

196
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.648
You guys are the very essence
of institutionalization.

197
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.928
Imprisoned by your own frostbitten,

198
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.928
working class limitations.

199
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.127
It's just sad, that's all.

200
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.328
- Visiting the child-bearers, are we boys?

201
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.408
Like good loving sons?

202
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.418
- Interesting proposition there, Wheezy.

203
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.318
Though in truth,

204
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.448
I was hoping to forego the family reunions

205
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.178
in favor of immediate inebriation.

206
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.348
What you saying, brethren?

207
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.168
- Well, I must concur with
my honorable colleague here,

208
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.868
and make only one
objection to said notion.

209
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.728
That of budgetary restrictions.

210
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.498
- Strike the objection,

211
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.628
for high street cash converters await.

212
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.294
- In that case, the motion passes.

213
00:09:09.296 --> 00:09:11.879
(upbeat music)

214
00:09:13.517 --> 00:09:16.600
(car engine revving)

215
00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:29.546
♪ I met a guy last week ♪

216
00:09:29.548 --> 00:09:34.411
♪ He's been my hero ♪

217
00:09:34.413 --> 00:09:39.413
♪ He gives me everything I ever need ♪

218
00:09:42.344 --> 00:09:45.155
♪ 'Cause he's real fine ♪

219
00:09:45.157 --> 00:09:46.814
♪ He's real fine ♪

220
00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:48.808
♪ And all so kind, you know ♪

221
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.348
- We see Grimsby as a real sleeping giant.

222
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.618
Ripe for a new breed
of young professional.

223
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.718
Metropolitans who want to spend

224
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.628
their salaries on artisan coffee,

225
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.168
cocktails, vegan lunches.

226
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.768
The young people don't want fish.

227
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.037
It's just a bit too fishy.

228
00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:12.658
(group laughing)

229
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.375
Thank you all for listening.

230
00:10:14.377 --> 00:10:17.127
(group clapping)

231
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.368
- Well for what it's worth, Kelly,

232
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.358
this is the kind of forward

233
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.248
thinking idea that Grimsby needs.

234
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.448
- And rest assured I can deal

235
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.038
with any untimely planning issues

236
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.018
which might surface at Whitehall.

237
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.938
- I think this is disgusting.

238
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.068
All you care about is your profits,

239
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.718
and you, you politicians.

240
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.398
You care nothing about Grimsby,

241
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.228
the town, the history of the people--

242
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.061
- Bit much, isn't it?

243
00:10:38.063 --> 00:10:39.358
- How is that a bit much?

244
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.551
You come up here from London
and you've never even--

245
00:10:41.553 --> 00:10:44.803
(group arguing loudly)

246
00:10:50.897 --> 00:10:54.355
(water trickling)

247
00:10:54.357 --> 00:10:55.940
- Oh, look at that.

248
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.953
I seem to have made a terrible mess.

249
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.283
Charlie?

250
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.803
Very impressive, Ms. Devine.

251
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.493
And apologies for the outburst.

252
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.448
Some people in the firm
have been here for so long,

253
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.835
they think they own the sodding place.

254
00:11:17.837 --> 00:11:18.668
(chuckles)

255
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.158
- Should you decide to go ahead,

256
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.778
how long will it take to wind things up?

257
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.178
Specifically, release the land?

258
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.318
- Oh, don't worry about that.

259
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.763
We're well down that road.

260
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.208
Well, unfortunately I have
other business to attend to,

261
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.433
so you can let yourselves out.

262
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.898
- Would you like me to stick
around a while, Mr Barr?

263
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.733
- No.

264
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.208
Send young Gilly in, would you?

265
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.913
We need some new blood
moving forward, I reckon.

266
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.958
- It's 12 a kilo, Mike.

267
00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.158
No, I can't go any lower.

268
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.958
We've got no quota left.

269
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.058
- [Curly] Despite fancying
her since we were kids,

270
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.138
Gilly's always been destined for

271
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.448
bigger things than Grimsby can give her.

272
00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.368
She worked her way up through
the depths of Barr's Fisheries

273
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.188
to become our Supreme
Leader's right-hand woman.

274
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.628
- All right, well it's your call,

275
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:13.858
but when nobody wants your surplus,

276
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.758
don't come running back to me

277
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.228
with your cockles in your hand, hey?

278
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.088
- [Curly] And she's learned
a thing or two from him.

279
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.288
- All right.

280
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.043
12 it is, darl.

281
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.483
- You're wanted, board room.

282
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.940
- How's it all going in there?

283
00:12:29.646 --> 00:12:32.313
(clock ticking)

284
00:12:33.696 --> 00:12:34.858
(upbeat music)

285
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.388
- Three day millionaires.

286
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.221
That's what they called my dad

287
00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:39.118
and his mates back in the olden days.

288
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.128
See, maritime folklore says if you go

289
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.838
back to sea with coin in your pocket,

290
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.320
your ship's sinking faster
than beans through a cowboy.

291
00:12:45.322 --> 00:12:46.338
And in this town,

292
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.704
if you've got three days
on land to blow a wage,

293
00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:51.017
that pretty much makes you a millionaire.

294
00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:53.590
Now, first rule of the
three day millionaire.

295
00:12:53.592 --> 00:12:55.683
If you're gonna get fire
to the world as we do,

296
00:12:55.685 --> 00:12:57.435
you don't do it looking
like your mam's dressed you.

297
00:12:57.437 --> 00:12:59.343
You do it sharp as Tewksbury mustard.

298
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.748
Stick around, Chauffeur.

299
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.719
- Love to mate.

300
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:09.475
All right, where's the party?

301
00:13:09.477 --> 00:13:11.386
- Budgie's gaff.

302
00:13:11.388 --> 00:13:12.221
- What?

303
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:15.644
(upbeat music)

304
00:13:18.936 --> 00:13:20.908
(crowd speaking)

305
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.764
Curly, you said a few?

306
00:13:22.766 --> 00:13:24.652
- This is all for you, Budgie boy.

307
00:13:24.654 --> 00:13:25.485
- Oh, that's nice.

308
00:13:25.487 --> 00:13:27.448
Yeah, I don't see how I benefit from this.

309
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.281
- Oh, mate.

310
00:13:28.283 --> 00:13:29.128
Do you really think I'd forget?

311
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.868
Right, Queenie's coming.

312
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:31.701
- What?

313
00:13:31.703 --> 00:13:34.030
- Yeah, Queenie's coming.

314
00:13:34.032 --> 00:13:35.699
Tonight's the night.

315
00:13:39.948 --> 00:13:43.078
There must be a Queenie in
every fishing port in the world.

316
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.178
Loyal, hardworking,

317
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.080
and hard versed in the dying
art of pescatarian pilferage.

318
00:13:49.918 --> 00:13:50.835
- Ah, fuck!

319
00:13:54.552 --> 00:13:55.768
- Ta, love.

320
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.298
You're a star.

321
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.923
Roll on sodding pay day.

322
00:14:02.838 --> 00:14:05.368
- What the fuck are you doing?

323
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.473
- Elton, Honky Chateau years.

324
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.158
Oh Curly, she's here.

325
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.466
What am I gonna say to her?

326
00:14:13.468 --> 00:14:14.408
- Don't worry, Budge.

327
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:15.241
All right?

328
00:14:15.243 --> 00:14:17.068
Because you look like a right
bobby dazzler, all right?

329
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.123
Just be, uh,

330
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:19.883
just be Budgie.

331
00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:22.323
Not too much Budgie.

332
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.245
Go on.

333
00:14:25.247 --> 00:14:26.883
- Bit of perfume should help.

334
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.338
Can you smell it, mam?

335
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.828
- I'm still getting a whiff of
cod guts to be honest, love.

336
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.973
- Fuck off, you cow.

337
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.703
Seriously?

338
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.638
- Now then, Marion.

339
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.778
Now then, Queenie.

340
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.730
- Now then, Budgie.

341
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.203
(Budgie coughing)

342
00:14:49.687 --> 00:14:51.598
(coughs)

343
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.248
- You what?

344
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.808
Oh.

345
00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.973
- Go on, treat yourself to some cock.

346
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.840
- May I join you?

347
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.710
- What's with the straw?

348
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.328
- Oh, I find I drink less this way.

349
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.163
It paces me.

350
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.738
You know, shelled foods are good for that?

351
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.813
Pistachios, oysters.

352
00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.628
I use obstacles to slow me down.

353
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.630
It stops me gorging.

354
00:15:26.832 --> 00:15:28.953
You know I once choked eating lutefisk?

355
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.808
- Is this one of your
famous cocktails then, Curl?

356
00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.028
- Now this is an ancient recipe,

357
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:46.318
handed down from father to
son for over a thousand years.

358
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.443
Ladies and gentlemen, behold.

359
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.518
The near mythical alchemy of Green Diesel.

360
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.888
- Observe ye the Fisherman, ladies,

361
00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.890
as he abandons the here and
now for the fever of dreams.

362
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.758
Hints of dark fruit.
(belches)

363
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.913
A beguiling back note of,

364
00:16:19.876 --> 00:16:20.709
uh, fuck.

365
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.898
- [Party Guest] Oh, Codgie!

366
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.928
- The mighty Trawlerman returns.

367
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.488
- [Curly] That is Demi,

368
00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.098
a genuine aficionado of
the intrepid Trawlerman.

369
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.078
Affectionately known as Pitbull,

370
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.598
meaning takes zero shit from any fucker,

371
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.648
including marine-life.

372
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.178
- You know what he said to me, right?

373
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.488
He goes, I want that haddock skin side up.

374
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:42.538
I said, do you?

375
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.488
Well we want our fucking overtime back.

376
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.198
So you know what you can
do with that haddock?

377
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.698
You can take that fucking haddock,

378
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.281
and you can stick it up your fuck--

379
00:16:49.283 --> 00:16:50.433
- You get the point.

380
00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.458
Codge has been like a tom-cat

381
00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.618
with three bollocks ever since they met.

382
00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.788
Clearly he's not mentioned the fact

383
00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.991
he's not technically a Trawlerman anymore.

384
00:17:01.993 --> 00:17:03.573
A troubling detail for sure.

385
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.448
- Curly, I need you.

386
00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.368
- No you don't, Budge.

387
00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.018
Look, Queenie worships you.

388
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.044
- No, it's not that.

389
00:17:14.046 --> 00:17:15.383
Curly, my mum's on her way home.

390
00:17:15.385 --> 00:17:16.841
- We always knew this might happen.

391
00:17:16.843 --> 00:17:17.805
Look, just go and get her a drink.

392
00:17:17.807 --> 00:17:18.638
- Curly, I can't!

393
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.858
It's much worse than that!

394
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.691
- Jesus, Budge.

395
00:17:20.693 --> 00:17:21.568
What is it?

396
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:22.670
- Mr. Barr's with her.

397
00:17:24.256 --> 00:17:27.173
(muffled chatting)

398
00:17:31.483 --> 00:17:34.391
- (screams) Budgie!

399
00:17:34.393 --> 00:17:37.528
- A travesty to despoil such a fine

400
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.933
and majestic brogue, sir.

401
00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.880
- I tried to keep it tidy, mum.

402
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.473
- Go on, sod off.

403
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.297
- Sorry Budgie's mum.

404
00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:52.132
- Mhm.

405
00:17:53.315 --> 00:17:54.148
- Dipshit.

406
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.630
- Come on, Budgie.

407
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.098
- Just spruced up the
gaff for you, Mrs Budgell.

408
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.883
Oh, and just a little something
for the inconvenience.

409
00:18:06.746 --> 00:18:09.146
- Thought you'd be involved
in this, Curly Dean.

410
00:18:11.074 --> 00:18:13.310
Go on then, clear off.

411
00:18:13.312 --> 00:18:17.218
- Mr Barr, how did the big meeting go?

412
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.288
Got any news for the troops?

413
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.033
- You're Teapot's lad, aren't you?

414
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.668
Well, you can the troops
that the news is good.

415
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.588
In fact, it's great news.

416
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.138
Decisions have been made,
paper's have been signed,

417
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.023
and an announcement is imminent.

418
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.363
- Now, where were we?

419
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.083
(Donny chuckling)

420
00:18:52.547 --> 00:18:54.598
- That's the last of it, Charlie.

421
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.400
I'll be back Monday to transfer
it to Mr. Barr's client.

422
00:19:04.037 --> 00:19:07.416
(traffic rumbling)

423
00:19:07.418 --> 00:19:10.251
(crowds chatting)

424
00:19:15.852 --> 00:19:16.978
- Lots of rumors going round

425
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.903
in there with your name attached.

426
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.438
You ought not to lead them on like that.

427
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.058
- Just keeping up morale, Mr. Gee.

428
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.528
- Oh aye.

429
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.498
Or leading them on a
merry dance, you mean.

430
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.108
- Now I assume you've all met Mr. Gee.

431
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.838
Ex-Trawlerman, turned to the dark side.

432
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.218
Though, to be fair,

433
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.618
I'd have a face like a
smacked arse too if my wife

434
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.120
traded me in for a Greek
Adonis with a hedge fund.

435
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.224
Bit mardy, aren't we?

436
00:19:43.226 --> 00:19:44.423
Your goldfish die or summat?

437
00:19:44.425 --> 00:19:46.675
(chuckles)

438
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.593
- Obviously you don't know.

439
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.221
- Know what?

440
00:19:52.223 --> 00:19:54.298
- You're finished lad, in short.

441
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.131
We all are.

442
00:19:55.133 --> 00:19:56.098
You, me,

443
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:56.933
them lot.

444
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.253
Barr's pulled the plug.

445
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.488
- No.

446
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.918
I was with Barr earlier and
he said it was good news.

447
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.138
- Yeah, there is for him.

448
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.998
He's flogged the docks,

449
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.248
purchased by The Devine Residential Group.

450
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.553
It's got a nice little
ring to it that, hasn't it?

451
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.548
- You were in the meeting?

452
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.881
- Yeah.

453
00:20:18.883 --> 00:20:20.938
And I hope you like drinking bucket loads

454
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.308
of shite coffee and
eating overpriced muffins,

455
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.993
because that is what's happening.

456
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:27.238
They're like an army,

457
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.758
taking over towns with their franchises.

458
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.218
Kids serving bloody
kids on a minimum wage,

459
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.688
working for fat cat owners who'll

460
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.583
never step food near this place.

461
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.788
- Barr wouldn't sell his golden goose.

462
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:39.621
Why would he?

463
00:20:39.623 --> 00:20:41.458
- It's all right, don't worry.

464
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.808
You'll get another job!

465
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.337
I mean, do you like making Frappuccinos?

466
00:20:47.173 --> 00:20:48.693
- What about the MP?

467
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.418
The guy who was on the TV,

468
00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.758
the guy trying to save
the fishing industry?

469
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.918
- Politicians love talking about

470
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.898
how much they care about our industry,

471
00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.698
when the fact is when it matters,

472
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.163
Curly, they couldn't care less!

473
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.813
It's the sprawl, Curly lad.

474
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.483
They found us.

475
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.043
They found us and you know it.

476
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.149
- It can't end like this.

477
00:21:21.151 --> 00:21:22.498
It can't.

478
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.288
Our livelihoods, our very
lives depend on this.

479
00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:26.728
- [Mr. Graham] Curly, where you going?

480
00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:27.561
- I'm going to see Barr.

481
00:21:27.563 --> 00:21:29.578
- He's not gonna tell
you the truth, is he!

482
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.448
Listen to me.

483
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.855
You're no nobody, just like me.

484
00:21:31.857 --> 00:21:33.358
- (screams) Look, we have to do something!

485
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.438
- Curly, stop!

486
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.338
Right?

487
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.468
You've got your head
buried in the sand, lad.

488
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.318
Our industry has been dying for years.

489
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.278
Just ask your old man.

490
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.048
This,
I mean, this?

491
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.878
This is just the final nail in the coffin.

492
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.948
- All right, so that's it then is it?

493
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:48.748
We just turn over and die?

494
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.458
My old man says the the
glory days are coming back,

495
00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.538
and guess what?

496
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.468
I believe him.

497
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.268
- The paper's are signed, son.

498
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.323
I seen it happen.

499
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.963
We're just dead wood now.

500
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.473
Just...

501
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.113
Just look after yourself, hey kid.

502
00:22:16.837 --> 00:22:19.420
(upbeat music)

503
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.507
- There he is, man of the hour.

504
00:22:28.509 --> 00:22:29.340
Here.

505
00:22:29.342 --> 00:22:30.227
Hang onto these for us, brother.

506
00:22:30.229 --> 00:22:32.758
Cassa's bouncers are onto us.

507
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.648
For those who seek passage to

508
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.083
the other side of the midnight hour.

509
00:22:38.361 --> 00:22:40.361
(sighs)

510
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.918
- You don't think me and
Codge'll last, do you?

511
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.998
I can tell.

512
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.831
- No, it's not that.

513
00:22:48.833 --> 00:22:50.518
It's just I am the last person

514
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.258
you should talk to about love.

515
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.241
Trust us.

516
00:22:53.243 --> 00:22:54.993
- Can't stop pissing at the moment.

517
00:22:56.486 --> 00:22:57.628
- Don't do anything silly,

518
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.248
will you, Dems?

519
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.083
Don't get stuck.

520
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.278
I just mean that none of us
know what the future holds.

521
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.128
Just be careful, yeah?

522
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.068
- And why was it you really
came out tonight, Gilly?

523
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.048
To see Curly Dean, yeah?

524
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:15.033
So, pot and kettle.

525
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.703
Come on.

526
00:23:19.645 --> 00:23:22.062
(rock music)

527
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.390
(dance music)

528
00:23:53.577 --> 00:23:54.410
- Woo!

529
00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:13.457
- Never had you pegged
as a clubber, Mr. Gee.

530
00:24:13.459 --> 00:24:15.598
(Mr. Graham chuckling)

531
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.433
- Yeah.

532
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.688
I was the life and soul once,

533
00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.253
Curly lad, just like you.

534
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.242
And this here?

535
00:24:23.244 --> 00:24:25.773
This is where we met, me and Jenny.

536
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.908
- What's he doing with his ships?

537
00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:30.743
- Written off.

538
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.048
Barr's brother works
for the loss adjusters,

539
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.608
so he's got me scrapping them for cash.

540
00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.818
Nice little tax free bonus for himself.

541
00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.728
- Why can't he just get the
investors to put money in?

542
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.808
Revive the industry.

543
00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:45.388
- Because it's land they're after, lad.

544
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.663
Riverside locations, not fucking fish.

545
00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.708
- So what do you want, Mr. Gee?

546
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.201
Assume you're not here on the pull.

547
00:24:55.203 --> 00:24:56.248
- Well, you know,

548
00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.213
I've been thinking.

549
00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.073
At first I thought it was
just a reaction to everything,

550
00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:04.588
but now I can't get it out of my head.

551
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:05.728
- Go on.

552
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.098
- It's the company safe, Curly.

553
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.758
It's fit to burst, but not for long.

554
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.393
Barr has got this cash for
crypto currency thing going on.

555
00:25:17.303 --> 00:25:18.993
- What're you saying, Mr. Gee?

556
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.158
- What I'm saying is,

557
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.293
maybe I'm saying, just maybe,

558
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.033
we could empty that safe before he does.

559
00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.574
- You'd die for that company,

560
00:25:34.576 --> 00:25:38.361
and now you wanna rob the place?

561
00:25:38.363 --> 00:25:39.278
Give me a break.

562
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.130
- Look, why not?

563
00:25:41.132 --> 00:25:42.674
They're robbing me!

564
00:25:42.676 --> 00:25:44.908
And it's like you said, Curly lad.

565
00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:48.303
We can't just roll over and die, can we?

566
00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.990
- I think it's past your bedtime, Mr. Gee.

567
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.593
Sweet dreams.

568
00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.900
- You can't carry on
living in the past, Curly.

569
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.913
Your dad's days of the three
day millionaires are gone.

570
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.170
The world has moved on,

571
00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.948
and if you carry on
clinging onto the past,

572
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.300
it'll leave you behind too.

573
00:26:17.477 --> 00:26:18.310
Listen to me.

574
00:26:19.872 --> 00:26:24.058
There is over 500 grand
sitting in that bloody safe.

575
00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.738
The sort of money the likes of me and you,

576
00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.290
we don't come across too often.

577
00:26:29.569 --> 00:26:32.092
- So do it then.

578
00:26:32.094 --> 00:26:33.660
What you asking me for?

579
00:26:33.662 --> 00:26:37.173
- Because it's not just
a one man job now, is it.

580
00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.690
- Enjoy your life, Mr. Gee.

581
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.938
- We could use that money to set up

582
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.490
our own little fishing
operation on the North Bank.

583
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:49.980
And get your old man!

584
00:26:51.047 --> 00:26:53.964
Get your old man to Skipper for us.

585
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.690
Get him up off his arse
and get him back out there.

586
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.868
You're a fucking Trawlerman, Curly.

587
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:01.905
Like me, and like your old man,

588
00:27:01.907 --> 00:27:04.443
and nothing you can do can change that.

589
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.430
The only question is are you
ready to fight for who you are?

590
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.558
- Curly, wait!

591
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.797
Where you going?

592
00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:21.952
Do you not wanna come in for a drink?

593
00:27:21.954 --> 00:27:23.424
- Is it true, Gilly?

594
00:27:23.426 --> 00:27:24.508
- What?

595
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.948
- Barr, mm?

596
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:27.088
Flogging the docks, shutting shop.

597
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.358
Is it true?

598
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.998
- Curly.

599
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.283
- How long have you known?

600
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.980
The last trip, when me and you was...

601
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.661
Wow!

602
00:27:38.663 --> 00:27:39.496
- Curly, listen.

603
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.938
Things just,

604
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.618
they can't stay the same, all right?

605
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.451
Trust me.

606
00:27:44.453 --> 00:27:47.008
You just go out and
catch fish, and get paid,

607
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.658
but I see what's going
on through the books.

608
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.458
- You, hey?

609
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.438
Proper little management, hey?

610
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.998
Fair fucking play to you.

611
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.648
Fair fucking play.

612
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.481
You know me?

613
00:27:56.483 --> 00:27:57.575
I deserve it.

614
00:27:57.577 --> 00:27:59.244
- Curly wait, Curly!

615
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:02.721
Curly, wait!

616
00:28:02.723 --> 00:28:03.554
- Do you know what?

617
00:28:03.556 --> 00:28:04.387
I'm fine Gilly, all right?

618
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:05.368
Just go back inside.

619
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.364
- Just stop bloody talking
for a minute, will you?

620
00:28:08.366 --> 00:28:09.199
Just...

621
00:28:10.347 --> 00:28:11.818
I can't believe I'm doing this.

622
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.370
Just gimme a minute, all right?

623
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.288
All that stuff in there, yeah,

624
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:20.818
that's just my job.

625
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.841
That's all it is.

626
00:28:21.843 --> 00:28:23.406
- [Curly] Yeah, and
that's mine as it goes.

627
00:28:23.408 --> 00:28:24.388
- Okay, fine!

628
00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.068
But they're just our
jobs is what I'm saying.

629
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.148
- Do you know what?
I'm going, Gilly.

630
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:28.383
- No Curly, I like you.

631
00:28:34.003 --> 00:28:36.808
If you just, you've got into my head,

632
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:38.428
or under my skin, or something,

633
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.813
and every cell in my body is
telling me that I shouldn't.

634
00:28:41.815 --> 00:28:43.065
But I like you.

635
00:28:45.347 --> 00:28:49.473
I mean, more than like.

636
00:28:50.943 --> 00:28:53.693
(acoustic music)

637
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:15.118
Just promise me you won't
do anything stupid, Curly.

638
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.120
- I promise.

639
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.270
- Why do they call you Queenie?

640
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.838
- Mam told me that when I were born,

641
00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.158
my grandad said he could tell

642
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.473
I'd do something special one day.

643
00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:49.190
That's why they called us Queenie.

644
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.703
- Were it your life's dream
to work with scallops?

645
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:56.818
- My career's officer said
there were two things on offer.

646
00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.043
Hairdressing or shellfish.

647
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.703
Mam worked at Barr's, so she got us in.

648
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.668
- I like shellfish.

649
00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.098
They're salty, and they come in a shell.

650
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.303
Always a bonus.

651
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.580
I'm not a very good Fisherman though.

652
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.210
Curly says I am, that's why
he always bunks in with me,

653
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.978
but Mr. Barr only gave me the job

654
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.658
'cause my mum kept nagging him.

655
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.368
- You're a good dancer though.

656
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:24.718
- You think so?

657
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.553
I love dancing.

658
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.653
- And your grandad, he was?

659
00:30:34.718 --> 00:30:36.088
- You know what we said to the coastguard

660
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.390
just before the ship sank?

661
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.013
They asked him what his intentions were,

662
00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.978
but he couldn't do anything.

663
00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.680
Only a mile out from port and all.

664
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:51.778
He said to them, I have no intentions.

665
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.330
Please give all the men's
love to all the families.

666
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.058
Them were his last words.

667
00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:57.893
- Wow.

668
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.618
You know, I don't think I
could ever be that brave.

669
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.653
- No one knows what they could be, Budgie.

670
00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.013
Not unless we're there,
right there in that moment.

671
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.778
- Queenie, do you ever think about

672
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.813
leaving Grimsby and just starting again?

673
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.000
- Come on, I'm on earlies all this week.

674
00:31:25.108 --> 00:31:27.858
(acoustic music)

675
00:31:44.231 --> 00:31:47.398
(alarm clock ringing)

676
00:31:52.014 --> 00:31:54.876
♪ And I start to fall ♪

677
00:31:54.878 --> 00:31:59.878
♪ I don't want to be alone ♪

678
00:32:03.249 --> 00:32:07.135

(seagulls squawking)

681
00:32:33.183 --> 00:32:34.383
- It's funny, innit?

682
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.918
My mam was already married by my age.

683
00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.478
- [Codge] Crazy.

684
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.080
- Well yeah, I used to think so,

685
00:32:42.926 --> 00:32:44.428
but I don't know.

686
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:45.718
I know it's old fashioned and that,

687
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.218
but I would if you would.

688
00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.658
- Pitbull, slow down.

689
00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.507
- Well, why not?

690
00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:54.718
You're a Trawlerman for Christ's sake.

691
00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.618
There's not many women who'd

692
00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.470
put up with that like I do, you know?

693
00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.020
I think we'd make a great team.

694
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.217
You catch the fish, I pack them.

695
00:33:03.219 --> 00:33:05.969
(Codge groaning)

696
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.448
And I want you to stop calling me Pitbull.

697
00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.007
We're supposed to be bloody adults, Codge.

698
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:24.566
(workers chatting)

699
00:33:29.238 --> 00:33:30.165
- I'm so sorry, love.

700
00:33:30.167 --> 00:33:31.272
I really am.

701
00:33:31.274 --> 00:33:32.174
I really am.

702
00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:33.663
I'm sorry, okay?

703
00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.488
- What the fuck is going on, Gilly?

704
00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.001
- I wanted to say something
last night, I really did.

705
00:33:40.003 --> 00:33:41.613
I just wasn't allowed.

706
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.853
- No, this can't happen.

707
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.180
Is Codge being let go and all?

708
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.938
- [Gilly] What do you mean?

709
00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.465
- Codge, is he being let go or not?

710
00:33:59.467 --> 00:34:01.396
- Codge doesn't work for Barr's.

711
00:34:01.398 --> 00:34:02.862
He hasn't done in ages.

712
00:34:02.864 --> 00:34:04.465
- [Demi] What?

713
00:34:04.467 --> 00:34:05.390
No, you're lying.

714
00:34:05.392 --> 00:34:06.721
- I thought you knew, darl.

715
00:34:06.723 --> 00:34:09.123
It's the pills, gross misconduct.

716
00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.198
- You're a liar, Gilly Simmo.

717
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.583
That's what you are,
you're a fucking liar.

718
00:34:15.585 --> 00:34:16.668
- Demi, Demi!

719
00:34:28.314 --> 00:34:31.965
(doorbell ringing)

720
00:34:31.967 --> 00:34:35.963
- (laughs) Halle-fucking-lujah.

721
00:34:35.965 --> 00:34:36.798
Entre!

722
00:34:37.676 --> 00:34:38.759
Entre, entre.

723
00:34:40.708 --> 00:34:41.678
- What are you doing, mate?

724
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.348
- Mate, you got those pills?

725
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.218
I'm seriously jittery.

726
00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.051
- No, look.

727
00:34:45.053 --> 00:34:46.888
I need you sober, all right?

728
00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:48.058
Tell me about the dream.

729
00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.891
- What dream?

730
00:34:48.893 --> 00:34:51.898
- The dream, Alfy Glassel
in California sunshine,

731
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.548
the panty biting bollocks.

732
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.854
- Mate, just give me the fucking--

733
00:34:54.856 --> 00:34:56.095
- Fuck off, Codge.

734
00:34:56.097 --> 00:34:56.960
- Get off me, man!

735
00:34:56.962 --> 00:34:57.818
I'll melt your fucking head in.

736
00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.248
- Look, we need to do something.

737
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.238
All right, we've got to.

738
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.098
Barr is selling the docks, we're done.

739
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.778
- Yeah, I could have told you that.

740
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.608
I did tell you that, many times.

741
00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.594
- Just tell me that
fucking dream, will you?

742
00:35:07.596 --> 00:35:09.748
- Shall I tell you what dreams are, Curly?

743
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.628
Dreams are there to keep
you through the night.

744
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:13.888
When the waves are crashing over the bow

745
00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.990
and home's still a fuck of a long way off.

746
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.558
They're not meant to be lived, Curly.

747
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.391
- What are you on about?

748
00:35:20.393 --> 00:35:22.918
- Alfy Glassel's doing
15 years in Rampton.

749
00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.138
I went to see him, he's
as mad as a March Hare.

750
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.448
He thinks he's living in Santa Cruz.

751
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:28.913
- So then what was all that about?

752
00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:32.788
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

753
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.248
My name's not Codge, it's Andrew Pearson,

754
00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:36.208
and I'm full of shit.

755
00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:39.063
Now please, pretty fucking please,

756
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.213
can I have my mind altering drugs back?

757
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:44.303
- Hi Demi.

758
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.821
- Hi beautiful.

759
00:35:46.823 --> 00:35:48.658
- You shut the fuck up.

760
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:49.599
And you?

761
00:35:49.601 --> 00:35:51.397
- I'll see myself out.

762
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:52.232
- Great.

763
00:35:54.161 --> 00:35:56.161
Not you, you divvy cunt.

764
00:35:57.216 --> 00:35:59.966

Now then, you old bastard.

774
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.978
- Just tied off, have you?

775
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.178
- Yeah.

776
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.113
Yesterday, dad.

777
00:37:19.299 --> 00:37:20.805
- Been thinking about
going back out with you.

778
00:37:20.807 --> 00:37:22.438
Get my sea legs back.

779
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.563
Can't find a boat for love
nor money at the moment, like.

780
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.013
- Yeah, it's crap innit?

781
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.893
- It'll come back, just a lull.

782
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:40.048
Hey, what about your boat?

783
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:41.458
I told you I used to sail out

784
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.734
for Barr back in the day, didn't I?

785
00:37:43.736 --> 00:37:44.569
- Yeah.

786
00:37:45.428 --> 00:37:47.308
Yeah you did, dad.

787
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:49.828
- I won't slow you down or ought.

788
00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:51.663
He knows I'm a good grafter.

789
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.960
I left a few messages for him, but...

790
00:38:01.241 --> 00:38:03.058
- I don't think it really
works on that anymore dad.

791
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.753
I think you have to email
your CV and all that crap.

792
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:08.873
- Oh?

793
00:38:11.463 --> 00:38:13.318
Might need you to borrow us a few bob,

794
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.973
get myself set up, all that.

795
00:38:16.937 --> 00:38:19.495
- Yeah, no problem dad.

796
00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:22.253
You know me, always minted.

797
00:38:22.255 --> 00:38:24.922
(phone buzzing)

798
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.083
I'll have to move back in
for a bit, if that's alright?

799
00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.430
- Room's still there.

800
00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.643
Brought you a brew.

801
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:49.943
- Cheers.

802
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:54.893
- Hey!

803
00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:58.473
Back out on tomorrow's tide, are you?

804
00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:00.610
- Just waiting to hear.

805
00:39:01.533 --> 00:39:02.943
A couple of quota problems.

806
00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.313
- Pissing frogs, hey?

807
00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.398
- Should've never allowed that 200 mile

808
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.748
exclusion zone around Iceland,

809
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:10.581
should we, dad?

810
00:39:10.583 --> 00:39:13.078
- Yeah, you're not wrong there lad.

811
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.538
If we dragged out
sovereignty that pissing far,

812
00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.208
every bastard in Paris'd
be eating pie and chips,

813
00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:20.703
and playing pissing bingo.

814
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.883
By hell.

815
00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:26.818
That old mucky river looks further

816
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.713
and further away every day.

817
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:34.773
They've said I have to go
back to that doctor, you know?

818
00:39:36.717 --> 00:39:37.617
- What?

819
00:39:37.619 --> 00:39:38.698
- Don't worry, you know what they're like.

820
00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.605
They'll always find
something wrong with you.

821
00:39:41.607 --> 00:39:43.733
- But you're gonna go though, aren't you?

822
00:39:43.735 --> 00:39:46.503
- They'll only tell us I
can't drink no more, son.

823
00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.583
What kinda life's that for
an old sea-dog like me, hey?

824
00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.653
- What's all that talk.

825
00:39:55.435 --> 00:39:56.268
Here, dad.

826
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.650
How'd you feel about getting
back in the wheel house?

827
00:40:01.674 --> 00:40:03.328
- What you on about?

828
00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:04.163
- Honestly.

829
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.723
I've had an offer, business.

830
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.088
A chance to go halves with
one of the big bosses.

831
00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:10.168
You remember Charlie Graham, don't you?

832
00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.848
- Bloody hell, son.

833
00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.681
Honest?

834
00:40:12.683 --> 00:40:13.516
- Yeah, honest.

835
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:16.558
What do you reckon?

836
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.318
Tackle the Mackerel grounds in the North?

837
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.928
Nobody knows them waters like you do.

838
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.733
- Aye, you're not wrong there.

839
00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.788
- So you're onboard then, yeah?

840
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.638
You're gonna do it, yeah?

841
00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.238
- I'll tell you what, son.

842
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.043
You just try and bloody stop me!

843
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.443
- Mr. Gee, it's Curly.

844
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.593
We're in.

845
00:40:37.885 --> 00:40:39.135
You got a driver in mind?

846
00:40:43.078 --> 00:40:45.995
(plastic rustling)

847
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:48.833
- [Budgie] Brown shrimp?

848
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.883
- It's just my mam I'm upset for, Budge.

849
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.150
I'll get a start somewhere.

850
00:40:59.151 --> 00:41:01.818
(phone buzzing)

851
00:41:04.277 --> 00:41:05.110
Who is it?

852
00:41:06.243 --> 00:41:07.263
- It's Curly.

853
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:11.218
They're having a business
meeting, they want me there!

854
00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.333
- Then go, silly.

855
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.433
Budgie, go!

856
00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.778
- I'm gonna get you your
mum's job back, Queenie.

857
00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.728
And yours, all right?

858
00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:21.693
Just you watch.

859
00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.683
- Look at me, you know how this works.

860
00:41:25.685 --> 00:41:26.638
- Go on, how?
Tell me--

861
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.471
- How else am I supposed to get

862
00:41:27.473 --> 00:41:28.468
through those 24 hour shifts?

863
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:31.420
- Oh yeah, and when exactly
was the last time you did that?

864
00:41:32.285 --> 00:41:34.138
(phone buzzing)

865
00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:34.973
What you doing?

866
00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:37.738
- Babes, I gotta go.

867
00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.694
- [Demi] Don't you fucking
dare, don't you fucking dare--

868
00:41:39.696 --> 00:41:40.648
- To be continued, I promise.

869
00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:41.668
- Don't you fucking dare.

870
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.038
Codge please, just wait a minute please!

871
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:44.913
I'm pregnant.

872
00:41:49.651 --> 00:41:50.484
Codge?

873
00:41:55.655 --> 00:41:58.322
(door slamming)

874
00:42:02.118 --> 00:42:05.868
(Elvis impersonator yelling)

875
00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.668
- [Elvis] Thank you very much, thank you.

876
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:16.768
Thank you very much, you're fantastic.

877
00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:17.908
Hey, thank you very much.

878
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.468
Beautiful, thank you very much.

879
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:20.308
Goodnight, God bless you.

880
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:21.143
Thank you.

881
00:42:23.489 --> 00:42:26.322
- Wait, you're not joking are you?

882
00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:28.768
Fishermen we are.

883
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:31.648
Ocean's fucking four
we definitely are not.

884
00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:32.481
- Look, right.

885
00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:34.468
That money has been earnt
off the back of thousands

886
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:37.378
of years of pure graft
and pure sacrifice, yeah?

887
00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.628
It's ours, it's the communities.

888
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:40.461
And guess what?

889
00:42:40.463 --> 00:42:42.628
We're gonna take it back,
and we're gonna reinvest it.

890
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:43.558
- Right, ducks.

891
00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.408
For this next part, I
need some volunteers.

892
00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:48.148
Come on, someone?

893
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:49.888
Don't think you're
gonna get away with it--

894
00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:53.488
- As much as I love, and I
mean love cabaret afternoon,

895
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:55.288
I do believe the deal was to hear you out.

896
00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:56.158
I've done that, Curly,

897
00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.236
so gear now.

898
00:42:59.238 --> 00:43:00.958
- There's nought out there, okay?

899
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.458
Apart from the unthinkable.

900
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.291
And guess what?

901
00:43:03.293 --> 00:43:05.548
A nine to five ain't your bag, mate.

902
00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:06.898
Now this is the only way that we're

903
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.428
gonna save our way of life here, lads.

904
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:09.561
Yeah?

905
00:43:09.563 --> 00:43:11.158
We have to be our own cavalry, Codge.

906
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:11.991
Yeah?

907
00:43:11.993 --> 00:43:13.648
And guess what, I'm not
gonna do it without you.

908
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:15.131
- What about you, hm?

909
00:43:15.133 --> 00:43:18.358
Are you up for robbing
your old stepfather to be?

910
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.558
- Is it gonna annoy him?

911
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.578
- Oh!

912
00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.778
I should think so, Budge.

913
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:22.918
Yeah, picture for me,

914
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.318
if you will, the notorious Scarface scene,

915
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:28.738
featuring chainsaw and lumps
of your skull slash brains

916
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.290
arcing beautifully across
a plastic shower curtain.

917
00:43:32.925 --> 00:43:34.228
- I've not seen it.

918
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:35.061
- Listen to him.

919
00:43:35.063 --> 00:43:36.238
He's probably sniffed
out of his head himself.

920
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.598
- Would you fuck off.
- Fuck off--

921
00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.818
- Boys, boys.

922
00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.066
Right?

923
00:43:40.068 --> 00:43:42.328
I've listened to Mr. Gee's plan, okay,

924
00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:43.272
and he's tight.

925
00:43:43.274 --> 00:43:45.148
Now this is nothing compared to

926
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:46.800
the risk that we take out at sea.

927
00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.558
Now Budgie, are you in?

928
00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.468
- [Hypnotist] Come on, any volunteers?

929
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:53.343
Come on!

930
00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.683
Come on, anyone?

931
00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:02.008
- Yeah, I'm in.

932
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.778
- [Hypnotist] Oh lovely, come on up.

933
00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.848
Come on, I knew you wouldn't let me down.

934
00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:07.441
That's it, all the way.

935
00:44:07.443 --> 00:44:09.388
Come on, don't be shy.

936
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:10.528
Come on, that's it.

937
00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.464
Hold me hand.

938
00:44:11.466 --> 00:44:12.718
Thank you, someone,

939
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.768
for giving me a hand.

940
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:14.608
Lovely.

941
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:18.693
And I want you to imagine a
room with a clock ticking.

942
00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.408
- Look at me.

943
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:24.088
Mr. Gee has got this all figured out.

944
00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:25.168
- Nobody skips a beat,

945
00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:26.728
and then we all come out of this laughing.

946
00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.668
- And you're gonna go further
and further into a trance.

947
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:31.708
- You tell Codge how much is in there.

948
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:32.938
Listen to this.

949
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.658
- It's half a mill in
cash, maybe even a mill.

950
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.418
- Enough for us to set up our
own fishing charter company.

951
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.228
Maybe even a California branch.

952
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.858
- (laughs) Well, you should have said.

953
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:46.173
- The slight problem is that Budgie,

954
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.203
Budgie is our lynch-pin.

955
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.373
- In what possible world could that.

956
00:44:57.637 --> 00:44:59.791
(Budgie humming)
- Oh, look at him go!

957
00:44:59.793 --> 00:45:01.155
It's like Biggles, isn't it?

958
00:45:01.157 --> 00:45:04.648
- Be the key player in a
million pound heist operation?

959
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:05.622
- Because Budgie's the only one

960
00:45:05.624 --> 00:45:07.781
close enough to Barr to nick his laptop.

961
00:45:07.783 --> 00:45:10.816
(laughs quietly)

962
00:45:10.818 --> 00:45:13.408
- Well, this has been fun.

963
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:17.398
Clearly you've both gone a
bit fucking cocoa-bananas,

964
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.623
and I am officially out.

965
00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:23.748
Give me my fucking pills, would you?

966
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.591
- [Curly] Already flushed them, Codge.

967
00:45:25.593 --> 00:45:27.987
- You what?

968
00:45:27.989 --> 00:45:32.840
- You're a fucking mess, mate.

969
00:45:32.842 --> 00:45:36.873
- [Hypnotist] No, do not wave that around!

970
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.388
Excuse me everyone, I'm so sorry.

971
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:40.503
Right, pull that up.

972
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:43.391
Okay, lovely.

973
00:45:43.393 --> 00:45:44.548
Excuse me.

974
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:45.718
Well done, well done.

975
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.551
Round of applause.

976
00:45:46.553 --> 00:45:48.238
Come on, pull these up.

977
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.138
This way.

978
00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.818
Oh, it's like last weekend!

979
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.492

Yeah, where abouts are you?

985
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:16.952
Mate, yeah.

986
00:46:16.954 --> 00:46:18.088
Safe, I'll be there.

987
00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:18.923

because we need him back ASAP.

996
00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:15.771
- I don't know.

997
00:47:15.773 --> 00:47:18.513
To be honest, it's never
actually worked before.

998
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:20.783
- Budgie, mate.

999
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.328
Budgie, you all right?

1000
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.163
Anyone in?

1001
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:29.163
Anyone in there?

1002
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:31.438
- Don't you think it's weird how

1003
00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.168
you never see vegetables in the wild.

1004
00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:36.328
How you go beetroot, parsnips.

1005
00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:38.963
I've never seen a cauliflower
on a country walk before.

1006
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.338
They've taken them,

1007
00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.198
the farmers, they have.

1008
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.338
They've enslaved them.

1009
00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.128
- God, he's hallucinating.

1010
00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.563
He's psychotic, should I call a doctor?

1011
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:51.693
- He's all right.

1012
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.360
Good to have you back, Budgie.

1013
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.383
- All right twats, I'm in.

1014
00:48:00.646 --> 00:48:02.490
- Right boys.

1015
00:48:02.492 --> 00:48:04.858
There's a few things I need to
do before we can make a move.

1016
00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.541
So whatever it is that you
need to do, get it done.

1017
00:48:07.543 --> 00:48:10.623
We meet at the Old Pontoon
in just over an hour.

1018
00:48:12.345 --> 00:48:14.758
(tense music)

1019
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.738
First thing for me to do is disable

1020
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.341
the motion sensors in the safe room.

1021
00:48:19.343 --> 00:48:20.578
I use another member of staff's

1022
00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.948
override code to keep
our names in the clear.

1023
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:24.598
So after I've silenced the access alarm

1024
00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.488
and killed the CCTV system,

1025
00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:29.488
you'll be able to sneak
in without detection.

1026
00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:30.808
And remember, boys,

1027
00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:32.163
not a word to anybody.

1028
00:48:33.788 --> 00:48:35.218
(door knocking)

1029
00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.851
- [Queenie] Come in, mam.

1030
00:48:36.853 --> 00:48:39.508
- Hiya love, how did it go?

1031
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:40.648
- Pretty good, thanks.

1032
00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.213
Not too quick or anything.

1033
00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:45.593
- I think the wrapper on the
condom helped with the pacing.

1034
00:48:47.517 --> 00:48:50.267
(Budgie sighing)

1035
00:48:52.981 --> 00:48:54.688
- What you gonna do then?

1036
00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:56.817
Take Barr's money or what?

1037
00:48:56.819 --> 00:48:58.378
- I don't know.

1038
00:48:58.380 --> 00:48:59.908
What do you think?

1039
00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:01.018
- Well, if it means not having to stuff

1040
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.488
red-snapper in my kegs on payday,

1041
00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:03.483
I know what I'd do.

1042
00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.753
But it's not my call, Budgie.

1043
00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.520
This one's on you.

1044
00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:11.991
- Pitbull?

1045
00:49:11.993 --> 00:49:13.383
I mean, Demi?

1046
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:16.888
Got a plan, babes.

1047
00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:19.640
You're gonna blow a fucking
tit off when you hear this.

1048
00:49:26.658 --> 00:49:27.945
- Look, before you say anything,

1049
00:49:27.947 --> 00:49:29.899
I know I shouldn't have left you and--

1050
00:49:29.901 --> 00:49:31.490
- Curly, curly?

1051
00:49:31.492 --> 00:49:32.323
- No, no,
look.

1052
00:49:32.325 --> 00:49:33.156
Listen, listen.

1053
00:49:33.158 --> 00:49:34.758
It was a really shitty
thing to do, alright?

1054
00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.926
I had a lot on my mind last night--

1055
00:49:35.928 --> 00:49:36.759
- Curly, stop!

1056
00:49:36.761 --> 00:49:38.818
Just please stop, just stop a minute.

1057
00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.653
- What?

1058
00:49:40.907 --> 00:49:43.157
- I know what Charlie
Graham asked you to do.

1059
00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.173
I heard him.

1060
00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:47.458
I know you're gonna do it with him,

1061
00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.760
and I'm asking you not to.

1062
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:51.088
- I seriously don't know
what you're talking about.

1063
00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:52.138
- Please.

1064
00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:53.128
I've just been on the server,

1065
00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:56.613
and someone's just used my ID
to override the CCTV network.

1066
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.838
You promised me that you weren't
gonna do anything stupid.

1067
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:01.917
- Alright, I know I did but--

1068
00:50:01.919 --> 00:50:02.818
- But what?

1069
00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.158
What, you just wanted to shag me first?

1070
00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:05.991
- It's funny, that is,

1071
00:50:05.993 --> 00:50:07.288
because I seem to remember that

1072
00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:08.940
you invited me back to your flat.

1073
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.448
- I'm gonna have to tell Mr. Barr.

1074
00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.338
You do know that, right?

1075
00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.048
He's gonna call the police.

1076
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:17.357
- Why are you being so naive?

1077
00:50:17.359 --> 00:50:18.928
- What, by trying to help you
stay out of trouble you mean?

1078
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:20.629
- Well, this is obvious.

1079
00:50:20.631 --> 00:50:22.671
- It's theft, Curly.

1080
00:50:22.673 --> 00:50:23.504
- You know,

1081
00:50:23.506 --> 00:50:24.337
it's fine for bastards like Barr

1082
00:50:24.339 --> 00:50:25.531
to make money out of us, isn't it?

1083
00:50:25.533 --> 00:50:27.838
Then all of a sudden we lose our jobs,

1084
00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:30.210
and he gets to walk
away richer for it, huh?

1085
00:50:30.212 --> 00:50:32.008
Consider this out severance payment.

1086
00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:34.376
- It doesn't mean that you can have it.

1087
00:50:34.378 --> 00:50:36.718
- Oh, I get what this is.

1088
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.398
You think that he's gonna take you forward

1089
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.416
in whatever bullshit plans that he's got.

1090
00:50:40.418 --> 00:50:42.478
You know we're no different Gilly, okay?

1091
00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.980
If Barr shuts his company
down, we've got nothing.

1092
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:48.178
You're just worried that if
we get hold of that money,

1093
00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:50.680
that's gonna mess up your
glorious fucking career.

1094
00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.153
- You promised.

1095
00:51:12.951 --> 00:51:14.668
I've gotta tell him, Demi.

1096
00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:15.718
They're actually gonna do this,

1097
00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.158
it's happening while we're sitting here.

1098
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.048
- Alright, alright,
alright.

1099
00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:19.881
Just wait a minute, please.

1100
00:51:19.883 --> 00:51:21.958
Put the phone down, please.

1101
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.518
- What?

1102
00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.768
- Look, all I'm saying is that

1103
00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:28.558
maybe we shouldn't be so hasty about it.

1104
00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.668
Maybe we need to talk through

1105
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:31.448
the pros and cons and that first?

1106
00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:32.818
- There are no pros, Demi!

1107
00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:33.868
It's theft.

1108
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:35.788
Mr Barr needs that money.

1109
00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:37.258
- Really?

1110
00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.398
Does he really now?

1111
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.348
I ain't buying that.

1112
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:41.848
I've just lost my job, Gilly,

1113
00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:42.738
and I'm about to have a kid,

1114
00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:45.808
so don't be giving me a
sob story about the owner.

1115
00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:48.658
He dropped us lot faster
than fucking hot dog shit.

1116
00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.248
- It's not what you think.

1117
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.018
He's trying to make Grimsby better.

1118
00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.898
- Oh aye, poor old Mr. Barr.

1119
00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.303
What a hero, my arse.

1120
00:51:59.087 --> 00:52:02.206
(tense music)

1121
00:52:02.208 --> 00:52:04.138
- Okay, listen up.

1122
00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.888
Just one more time, okay?

1123
00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:10.288
Now, phones off.

1124
00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:11.121
Right?

1125
00:52:11.123 --> 00:52:14.758
We have to get through
three layers of security.

1126
00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.408
Number one, safe.

1127
00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:18.328
The security guard at the docks.

1128
00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:19.408
Codge, that's you.

1129
00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:22.228
Number two, the thumbprint
access to the buildings.

1130
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:23.061
That's Curly.

1131
00:52:23.063 --> 00:52:26.158
Now number three, that's the
coded lock to the safe itself.

1132
00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.168
- Yeah, without which?

1133
00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:29.158
- None of this would happen.

1134
00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:29.991
- Exactly.

1135
00:52:29.993 --> 00:52:31.408
Now, I don't care if
you're sick of hearing it.

1136
00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:33.028
- So when exactly do we hear

1137
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:35.788
your role in the operations, Charles?

1138
00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:36.621
- Well, you see,

1139
00:52:36.623 --> 00:52:39.298
I'm what they call the
brains of the operation, son.

1140
00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.798
Because I'll be the one in the spotlight

1141
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.878
when they come a-knocking,

1142
00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.288
so I have to put as much distance

1143
00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:46.558
between myself and that
safe as humanly possible.

1144
00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.758
- Look, he's right.

1145
00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.888
Plus he'll only hold us up.

1146
00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:50.721
- Yeah.

1147
00:52:50.723 --> 00:52:52.108
- None taken, Curly.

1148
00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:54.868
Now if I may be permitted
to continue, Codge.

1149
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:58.798
Now Mr. Barr uses software on
his laptop called Safe Gen.

1150
00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.631
Remember it.

1151
00:52:59.633 --> 00:53:03.448
A UPRN is transmitted to the
digital reader on the safe,

1152
00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:06.358
and the code is reset every 24 hours,

1153
00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:10.378
unless, unless we generate a new code,

1154
00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.213
which we will.

1155
00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:13.163
Or Budgie will.

1156
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:16.703
Budgie?

1157
00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:19.763
Budgie!

1158
00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:21.779
- Sorry, you talking to me?

1159
00:53:21.781 --> 00:53:22.864
- Yeah, yeah.

1160
00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:25.198
Right, anyway,

1161
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.458
that's enough of the team talk.

1162
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.291
Budgie,

1163
00:53:27.293 --> 00:53:28.498
you call me as soon as you lay

1164
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.268
hands on Barr's lappy, alright?

1165
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:31.588
Curly, you're up first.

1166
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:33.328
Wheezy, bez him round to Cassa's,

1167
00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:34.738
then drop Budgie back at his mums.

1168
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.640
- I'll do rat runs all day long, boss.

1169
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:41.728
- Now, Barr and Budgie's mum stop off

1170
00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:45.178
for one at Cassa's on the way
home everyday like clockwork.

1171
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:47.368
This is our chance to
get Barr's thumbprint.

1172
00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:48.688
If his print shows up as the last

1173
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:50.038
person to enter the building,

1174
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:50.967
we're in the clear.

1175
00:53:50.969 --> 00:53:51.800
- Oh, look Donny!

1176
00:53:51.802 --> 00:53:53.613
There's one of them lazy-spas on eBay.

1177
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:56.998
Fancy a bit of that don't you, Donny bear?

1178
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:57.833
Hm?

1179
00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.633
Donny!

1180
00:54:03.389 --> 00:54:06.056
(Donny sighing)

1181
00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:11.038
- Merci me, mon amour.

1182
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.121
- [Trev] Can I take that for you, duck?

1183
00:54:12.123 --> 00:54:14.908
- I've told you, I'm not done.

1184
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:15.910
- [Trev] No problem.

1185
00:54:20.009 --> 00:54:22.088
- Oh, come on!

1186
00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:24.380
- I thought he'd never finish it.

1187
00:54:24.382 --> 00:54:26.278
- Trev, you're a diamond.

1188
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.418
This never happened though, yeah?

1189
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:28.251
- Say no more.

1190
00:54:28.253 --> 00:54:30.046
What's this mischief you're up to then?

1191
00:54:30.048 --> 00:54:31.558
- You don't wanna know.

1192
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.633
- You owe me a night out.

1193
00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:36.148
- [Mr. Graham] Next, Budgie will nab

1194
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:38.488
Barr's laptop from his briefcase,

1195
00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:41.008
generate a new code, and then replace it,

1196
00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:42.538
all in the time it takes for Mr. Barr

1197
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:44.878
to play hide the schnitzel with his mum.

1198
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.708
Just remember, Budgie,

1199
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:48.188
act normal.

1200
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:49.768
(Budgie's mum giggling)

1201
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:50.601
- Oh.

1202
00:54:50.603 --> 00:54:52.078
- Hi mum, I'm home!

1203
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.128
Obviously, where I live.

1204
00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:54.243
Everything's normal.

1205
00:54:54.245 --> 00:54:56.845
Could I take your coat and bag, sir?

1206
00:54:56.847 --> 00:54:58.918
- Why don't you go round to Curly's, love?

1207
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.058
Hm?

1208
00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.600
Or put the telly on loud.

1209
00:55:06.874 --> 00:55:07.707
- Dipshit.

1210
00:55:12.408 --> 00:55:16.491
(Budgie's mum and Donny yelling)

1211
00:55:26.118 --> 00:55:27.697
- [Budgie's Mum] Hang on, hang on,

1212
00:55:27.699 --> 00:55:29.320
hang on love.

1213
00:55:29.322 --> 00:55:32.163
I think we need a bit of
assistance, Donny Bear.

1214
00:55:44.788 --> 00:55:46.832
Yes, yes,
come on!

1215
00:55:46.834 --> 00:55:48.571
Come one, come on.

1216
00:55:48.573 --> 00:55:49.770
Yes, yes,
yes!

1217
00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.909
- Are you sure you know what
you're doing here, Curls?

1218
00:55:53.911 --> 00:55:55.798
- I'd say very much to
the contrary, Wheezy.

1219
00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.778
In fact, it's only in
this moment I've realized

1220
00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.358
the gossamer thin chance
we have of success.

1221
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:02.998
- [Curly] Yeah, well fear not comrades.

1222
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.468
We watched a YouTube video,

1223
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:05.420
didn't we, Mr. Gee?

1224
00:56:06.722 --> 00:56:09.222
(tense music)

1225
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:15.928
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1226
00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:17.301
It's him, it's him,
it's him.

1227
00:56:17.303 --> 00:56:19.168
Budgie, Budgie.

1228
00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:20.218
Tell me you've got the laptop?

1229
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.322
- [Budgie] Yeah, I've got it.

1230
00:56:21.324 --> 00:56:23.658
- He's got it, he's got it,
he's got it.

1231
00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:25.648
- It says please enter password.

1232
00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:26.998
- You what?

1233
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.098
No, Barr doesn't use a password.

1234
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.469
- Well clearly he does, Mr. Gee.

1235
00:56:31.471 --> 00:56:32.968
- This is well exciting.

1236
00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:33.916
- No, this can't.

1237
00:56:33.918 --> 00:56:35.788
This can't be happening, it can't.

1238
00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:37.190
- This, this is how it ends?

1239
00:56:38.863 --> 00:56:40.498
Like this?

1240
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.331
Fucking hell, I mean,

1241
00:56:41.333 --> 00:56:43.648
I was at least hoping it
might end like a siege.

1242
00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:44.818
You know, come out blazing at

1243
00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.203
the cops a la Butch Cassidy and co.

1244
00:56:47.205 --> 00:56:48.838
But not a desktop password, boys.

1245
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.768
- Look, I'm telling you.

1246
00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:51.748
He didn't have a password when I checked.

1247
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:53.188
Jesus Christ.

1248
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:55.918
If somebody's blabbed, I swear to God.

1249
00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.835
- Just assume they're
onto us, assume it all.

1250
00:56:57.837 --> 00:56:59.848
New ID's, plastic surgery.

1251
00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:01.288
It's time to disband, boys!

1252
00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:02.848
Come on.

1253
00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:04.100
- Peace out, girl scouts.

1254
00:57:05.310 --> 00:57:06.478
- Okay everyone, I'm in.

1255
00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.614
The numbers were the hard bit.

1256
00:57:08.616 --> 00:57:09.447
I just went with one,

1257
00:57:09.449 --> 00:57:10.505
two, three.

1258
00:57:10.507 --> 00:57:11.929
Dipshit was easy.

1259
00:57:11.931 --> 00:57:15.367
(group yelling excitedly)

1260
00:57:15.369 --> 00:57:17.848
- Listen, listen,
settle down, settle down.

1261
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:18.681
Now Budgie, Budgie,

1262
00:57:18.683 --> 00:57:19.514
Budgie, Budgie.

1263
00:57:19.516 --> 00:57:20.968
Listen carefully, alright?

1264
00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:25.034
Now double click on the
icon that says Safe Gen.

1265
00:57:25.036 --> 00:57:29.433
Alright, now open up the
app and press generate new.

1266
00:57:31.672 --> 00:57:32.505
- Whoa!

1267
00:57:33.472 --> 00:57:35.008
- Okay, right.

1268
00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:37.288
Now give me the last eight digits.

1269
00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:38.123
Go ahead.

1270
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:41.008
- Nine

1271
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:42.598
four, two,

1272
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.431
one,

1273
00:57:43.433 --> 00:57:45.028
four, three,

1274
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:47.067
six, three.

1275
00:57:47.069 --> 00:57:49.138
- Okay, last one.

1276
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:53.283
Press the button which
says send code to safe.

1277
00:57:58.754 --> 00:58:01.104
(high pitched dinging)

1278
00:58:01.106 --> 00:58:02.275
- I did it.

1279
00:58:02.277 --> 00:58:03.658
(laughs)
Curly!

1280
00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:04.878
Curly, I did it.

1281
00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.398
It says code successfully sent to safe.

1282
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:10.316
(group screaming)

1283
00:58:10.318 --> 00:58:12.418
(upbeat music)

1284
00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:13.348
- Okay, good man.

1285
00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:15.238
Now listen to me carefully.

1286
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.676
You've got to get that laptop back

1287
00:58:16.678 --> 00:58:18.178
where it came from fast, alright?

1288
00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:20.158
Wheezy's gonna come
back for you now, yeah?

1289
00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.208
- Yes!

1290
00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:22.710
- Good lad, speak to you soon.

1291
00:58:28.664 --> 00:58:30.337
(suspenseful music)

1292
00:58:30.339 --> 00:58:31.748
- [Budgie's Mum] Come on, yes,

1293
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:32.583
yes, yes.

1294
00:58:35.123 --> 00:58:37.873
(Donny grunting)

1295
00:58:38.729 --> 00:58:42.812
(Budgie's mum yelling excitedly)

1296
00:58:47.845 --> 00:58:49.238
- I got the bloody lazy-spa!

1297
00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:51.408
Half bloody price and all, Donny Bear!

1298
00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:53.493
(laughs)

1299
00:58:54.751 --> 00:58:56.918
(sighing)

1300
00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.728
- [Mr. Graham] This is it, lads.

1301
00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:01.228
All we have to do is blag our way

1302
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:03.130
onto the docks without causing a stir.

1303
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:05.638
Kev's as bent as a nine bob note,

1304
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:09.058
and Codge's had dealings
with him, shall we say.

1305
00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.968
The point is to distract
him so he doesn't question

1306
00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:14.170
Wheezy too much as he
drives onto the docks.

1307
00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:18.298
- Now then Codgo, you crackhead.

1308
00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:20.043
- Salutations, K-man.

1309
00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:22.528
- Got chuff all for you, son.

1310
00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:23.718
Waiting on a Rusky Tanker to get in.

1311
00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:25.198
You'll have to come back.

1312
00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.178
- You see, that's where you're all wrong,

1313
00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:29.068
sir, because today,

1314
00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:31.323
I have got something for you.

1315
00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:35.860
Say hello to Mamma Shmagma.

1316
00:59:37.045 --> 00:59:38.128
- Chuff me.

1317
00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:39.418
- Ah, ah!

1318
00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:40.953
Careful now, K-Man.

1319
00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:45.243
She nips like a rescue
donkey with a sore arse.

1320
00:59:46.532 --> 00:59:48.123
- What is this, amateur hour?

1321
00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:49.973
Come round.

1322
00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.978
- Codge might well be doing this

1323
00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:58.438
to get off his fucking tits
for the next six months,

1324
00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.428
but not Curly.

1325
00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:01.828
Curly Dean thinks he's some kind of

1326
01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:03.448
Robin frigging Hood or something.

1327
01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:04.918
He's probably doing this with some

1328
01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.837
big idea of how to save Grimsby.

1329
01:00:07.839 --> 01:00:10.378
I know he's full of himself,

1330
01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.028
but his heart's in the right place,

1331
01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:15.868
and I know Codge is a fucking wreck head,

1332
01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:17.488
but I don't want my kids father

1333
01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:19.140
in prison before it's even born.

1334
01:00:20.477 --> 01:00:22.977
(tense music)

1335
01:00:28.236 --> 01:00:30.512
(car tires screeching)

1336
01:00:30.514 --> 01:00:31.345
- You alright, boys?

1337
01:00:31.347 --> 01:00:32.178
- [Curly] No.

1338
01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.613
Budgie's farted again, man.

1339
01:00:33.615 --> 01:00:35.638
It's like livestock and petrol.

1340
01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.390
- [Budgie] I'm nervous, that's all.

1341
01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.555
- Call the boys.

1342
01:00:41.557 --> 01:00:42.390
Now!

1343
01:00:43.782 --> 01:00:44.865
- Okay, okay.

1344
01:00:50.164 --> 01:00:51.414
- Codge, Codge!

1345
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:09.418
- How's your man?

1346
01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.870
- He poses no threat, Wheezy.

1347
01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.687
All it took was a soupcon of Horse Tranq.

1348
01:01:15.785 --> 01:01:17.313
- Clever!

1349
01:01:17.315 --> 01:01:19.315
You got horse, have you?

1350
01:01:22.383 --> 01:01:25.133
(dramatic music)

1351
01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.471
Right, what do I do now?

1352
01:01:32.473 --> 01:01:34.048
- Just do whatever getaway drivers do

1353
01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:35.518
when they're waiting to get away, yeah?

1354
01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.620
- Ten four, copy that.

1355
01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:39.358
Drive up and down looking for customers.

1356
01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.465
Regular day the office.

1357
01:01:40.467 --> 01:01:42.628
- Mate, what's all this about?

1358
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:44.218
- It's experience, mate.

1359
01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.898
You can break into fort knox
with that green shit on.

1360
01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.250
No one would bat an eyelid.

1361
01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:49.558
- True that.

1362
01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.683
Right, we'll buzz you when
we're ready to get out.

1363
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:55.048
- What's in the rucksack?

1364
01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:55.883
- Snacks.

1365
01:02:00.768 --> 01:02:03.435
(alarm beeping)

1366
01:02:08.744 --> 01:02:10.327
- Oh God, bollocks!

1367
01:02:11.166 --> 01:02:15.750
Chuff me.
(coughs)

1368
01:02:15.752 --> 01:02:18.144
- Kevin, is everything okay?

1369
01:02:18.146 --> 01:02:19.288
- Yeah, yeah,

1370
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:22.348
everything's fine, just
wrapping up for the night.

1371
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:23.650
- Lock up on your way out.

1372
01:02:28.774 --> 01:02:31.745
(Kevin coughing)

1373
01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:34.247
(tense music)

1374
01:02:58.936 --> 01:03:00.112
- See?

1375
01:03:00.114 --> 01:03:02.957
Mr Gee's turned the CCTV off
just like he said he would.

1376
01:03:02.959 --> 01:03:05.674
Budgie, you stay here and keep a look out.

1377
01:03:05.676 --> 01:03:07.541
Codge, come on.

1378
01:03:07.543 --> 01:03:10.293
(dramatic music)

1379
01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:23.675
- [Security System] Press again.

1380
01:03:23.677 --> 01:03:24.594
- Fuck man!

1381
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:26.981
Smudged it.

1382
01:03:26.983 --> 01:03:28.373
Fuck.

1383
01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:31.412
Codge, I've fucking smudged it.

1384
01:03:31.414 --> 01:03:32.497
Fucking work!

1385
01:03:41.508 --> 01:03:44.091
- Curly, the police are coming.

1386
01:03:48.189 --> 01:03:49.022
- Fuck!

1387
01:03:51.526 --> 01:03:52.609
Fucking hell.

1388
01:03:54.218 --> 01:03:57.551
- [Security System] Verified, thank you.

1389
01:04:06.232 --> 01:04:08.280
- Budgie, what the actual fuck?

1390
01:04:08.282 --> 01:04:09.265
- I know.

1391
01:04:09.267 --> 01:04:10.768
Mr. Barr had me in the offices for a bit

1392
01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:11.975
before I came to sea with you.

1393
01:04:11.977 --> 01:04:13.198
I must still be on the system.

1394
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.635
- An office life didn't
work out for you, no?

1395
01:04:14.637 --> 01:04:15.778
- But Curly, alright,

1396
01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:18.293
Mr. Barr is gonna know it's me
from my thumbprint, won't he?

1397
01:04:18.295 --> 01:04:19.461
Curly, I don't want to go to prison.

1398
01:04:19.463 --> 01:04:21.658
- Budgie, no one's going to jail.

1399
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.500
We're gonna destroy the
security systems on our way out.

1400
01:04:24.502 --> 01:04:25.733
Look, I promise you.

1401
01:04:25.735 --> 01:04:27.315
Okay, come on.

1402
01:04:27.317 --> 01:04:29.817
(tense music)

1403
01:05:00.089 --> 01:05:02.839
(keypad beeping)

1404
01:05:04.332 --> 01:05:07.293
- Hey, what if it's empty after all this?

1405
01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:15.363
- Six, three,

1406
01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:18.628
nine, four,

1407
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:19.885
two, one,

1408
01:05:19.887 --> 01:05:22.288
four, six,

1409
01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:23.357
three.

1410
01:05:23.359 --> 01:05:25.468
(sighs)

1411
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:26.923
This is it, boys.

1412
01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:36.743
Fucking hell!

1413
01:05:40.777 --> 01:05:43.527
(Codge laughing)

1414
01:05:44.662 --> 01:05:47.162
(tense music)

1415
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.970
I'll call the Wheeze machine.

1416
01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.018
- Curly, don't forget the fingerprints.

1417
01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.278
- Good point, Budge-O.

1418
01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.030
- When did you get all heist savvy?

1419
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:12.897
(door slamming)

1420
01:06:16.026 --> 01:06:17.638
Budgie?

1421
01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.970
- Anything?

1422
01:06:18.972 --> 01:06:19.828
- No, the same.

1423
01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:21.600
They've turned them all off.

1424
01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:23.935
- Give me the keys, come on.

1425
01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:31.495
(engine revving)

1426
01:06:31.497 --> 01:06:33.898
- Budgie, just open the door.

1427
01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.731
- I can't!

1428
01:06:34.733 --> 01:06:35.788
- Why not?

1429
01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:37.498
- Because I can't let you do this.

1430
01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.331
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1431
01:06:38.333 --> 01:06:40.438
- Look, I'm just gonna
take the money to Mr. Barr,

1432
01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.928
and then nobody is gonna go to prison.

1433
01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:44.698
I'm trying to save you, Codge.

1434
01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.558
I can not risk losing you.

1435
01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.421
Not both of you!

1436
01:06:47.423 --> 01:06:50.338
- Budgie, no one is gonna get caught.

1437
01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:53.338
- Look, Queenie said this
was better than my idea.

1438
01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:57.088
- Open this fucking
door, right fucking now!

1439
01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:58.648
- I was just gonna set
first to it, alright?

1440
01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:00.328
Then nobody can have it.

1441
01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:01.981
Queenie said that might
be dangerous, alright,

1442
01:07:01.983 --> 01:07:02.814
so I'm just gonna do this.

1443
01:07:02.816 --> 01:07:05.428
- Budgie, that's a really stupid idea.

1444
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:06.388
Alright?

1445
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:07.948
Just open the door, yeah,

1446
01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:09.958
and then we can all walk
out of here Scott free.

1447
01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.868
- Alright, my finger opened the door.

1448
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:14.248
I'm on the system, alright?

1449
01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:16.800
So they're gonna link me
to you, and to Codge too!

1450
01:07:16.802 --> 01:07:17.635
- Budgie.

1451
01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.568
I swear if you don't open this

1452
01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:24.208
door in the next five seconds.

1453
01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:25.558
- [Curly] Don't do this, Budge.

1454
01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.358
- I'm sorry guys.

1455
01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.353
I'm sorry Curly.

1456
01:07:29.627 --> 01:07:32.968
(gun clicking)

1457
01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:33.803
- Budgie.

1458
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.339
Budgie mate, what was that sound?

1459
01:07:40.341 --> 01:07:42.979
- You mean that clicky
shotgunny sort of sound?

1460
01:07:42.981 --> 01:07:44.064
- Yes, Budge.

1461
01:07:46.585 --> 01:07:48.168
What was it, Budge?

1462
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.583
(car engine revving)

1463
01:08:00.265 --> 01:08:01.768
- [Mr. Graham] Come on then, boys.

1464
01:08:01.770 --> 01:08:02.896
Give us your phones.

1465
01:08:02.898 --> 01:08:03.729
- Do you know what?

1466
01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:04.562
I always thought there was a bit

1467
01:08:04.564 --> 01:08:05.488
of good left in you, Mr. Gee.

1468
01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:09.615
Even after you traded your
honor of a life on the high seas

1469
01:08:09.617 --> 01:08:11.638
to shine your little arse
on your office chair,

1470
01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.368
but alas, you have proved me wrong.

1471
01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:15.201
- Yeah, well,

1472
01:08:15.203 --> 01:08:16.108
when you get to my age,

1473
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:17.998
then maybe you can
lecture me on good or bad.

1474
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:18.831
But do you know what?

1475
01:08:18.833 --> 01:08:20.493
You've barely lived, son!

1476
01:08:20.495 --> 01:08:21.838
(Budgie groaning)

1477
01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.128
What's wrong with you?

1478
01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:24.748
- Mr. Graham, it's my blood sugar.

1479
01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:27.250
I need a snack, I've got
some Mars bars in my bag.

1480
01:08:28.626 --> 01:08:29.626
- Mars bars?

1481
01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.338
Well go on then, hurry up.

1482
01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.268
I said hurry up!

1483
01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:34.708
- Do you know what?

1484
01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:35.661
You're gonna do down for this, Mr. Gee,

1485
01:08:35.663 --> 01:08:38.068
because I'm gonna tell
Barr fucking everything.

1486
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:39.068
- Yeah, well,

1487
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:40.588
you know, you can tell him all of that,

1488
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:42.988
but my guess is that that swag is so hot

1489
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:45.898
that he'll not want to
squeak to anybody about it.

1490
01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:47.908
- Do you think she's just
gonna come back to you, do you?

1491
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:49.798
Now you've got a few
bob back in your pocket?

1492
01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.328
- Yeah.

1493
01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:53.074
She's going nowhere, mate.

1494
01:08:53.076 --> 01:08:57.088
I've heard her new bloke is
rigged like a fucking moose.

1495
01:08:57.090 --> 01:08:57.921
- Do you know what?

1496
01:08:57.923 --> 01:09:00.058
You think you are so much
smarter than everybody else,

1497
01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:01.828
but I've got news for you.

1498
01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:03.058
You see all this, yeah?

1499
01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:05.158
This is all mine, right?

1500
01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.868
You see, I'm going out with a bang,

1501
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:08.188
old chum.

1502
01:09:08.190 --> 01:09:11.445
Reward for a life long
of fucking drudgery.

1503
01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:13.648
- Such a noble cause, Mr. Gee!

1504
01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:15.268
- Well, we are who we are,

1505
01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:16.198
ain't we?

1506
01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.963
And I know what I am, I know who I am,

1507
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.068
unlike you, Curly.

1508
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:22.288
You're just searching for an identity,

1509
01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:25.498
and you've opted for a lukewarm
version of your old man,

1510
01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.508
but deep down you know as well as I do

1511
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:29.998
that Teapot was the real deal,

1512
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:30.833
and you?

1513
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:33.980
You're just playing at it, son.

1514
01:09:35.145 --> 01:09:36.558
- Do it, Budge.

1515
01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.002
- Plan B, Mr. Gee.

1516
01:09:38.004 --> 01:09:40.221
(Budgie yelling)

1517
01:09:40.223 --> 01:09:42.973
(dramatic music)

1518
01:09:43.824 --> 01:09:44.983
- Shit, you bastard!

1519
01:09:44.985 --> 01:09:48.554
Get in there now, you little bastards.

1520
01:09:48.556 --> 01:09:50.473
Move, get in there now.

1521
01:09:51.934 --> 01:09:53.767
Get in there now, now.

1522
01:09:56.719 --> 01:09:59.802
(car engine revving)

1523
01:10:03.406 --> 01:10:05.870
- You stupid little twat.

1524
01:10:05.872 --> 01:10:08.705
(Budgie grunting)

1525
01:10:10.964 --> 01:10:11.797
- Shit.

1526
01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.313
- [Curly] Twat!

1527
01:10:16.315 --> 01:10:18.302
- [Budgie] Help, help.

1528
01:10:18.304 --> 01:10:20.091
- What's that smell?

1529
01:10:20.093 --> 01:10:22.315
Is that smoke?

1530
01:10:22.317 --> 01:10:24.632
No way, he's fucking torching the place.

1531
01:10:24.634 --> 01:10:25.784
Open the door!

1532
01:10:25.786 --> 01:10:27.619
Open the fucking door!

1533
01:10:28.953 --> 01:10:31.047
- Open the fucking door!

1534
01:10:31.049 --> 01:10:32.392
Open the door!

1535
01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:34.227
Open the fucking door.

1536
01:10:35.355 --> 01:10:36.522
Open the door!

1537
01:10:41.357 --> 01:10:43.190
Open the fucking door.

1538
01:10:47.626 --> 01:10:48.799
Open the door!

1539
01:10:48.801 --> 01:10:51.853
Mr. Gee, open the fucking door.

1540
01:10:51.855 --> 01:10:53.688
Open the fucking door.

1541
01:11:04.143 --> 01:11:06.976
(Budgie coughing)

1542
01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:12.607
(Codge coughing)

1543
01:11:12.609 --> 01:11:13.827
- Please, Mr. Gee.

1544
01:11:13.829 --> 01:11:18.829
Fucking help us.
(coughing)

1545
01:11:20.827 --> 01:11:23.910
(car engine revving)

1546
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:44.191
(coughing)

1547
01:11:47.624 --> 01:11:50.959
(car engine revving)

1548
01:11:50.961 --> 01:11:51.817
- Demi!

1549
01:11:51.819 --> 01:11:54.486
- We've got to get there, Gilly.

1550
01:12:00.624 --> 01:12:03.374
(Codge coughing)

1551
01:12:06.953 --> 01:12:10.293
- So after all the times we
thought we'd never make it home,

1552
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:15.093
we die in a stupid little
room in the office.

1553
01:12:16.634 --> 01:12:18.884
(coughing)

1554
01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.833
- Demi's pregnant, boys.

1555
01:12:25.954 --> 01:12:27.204
She's pregnant.

1556
01:12:28.793 --> 01:12:29.626
It's me.

1557
01:12:34.847 --> 01:12:37.180
I was gonna be a dad, Curly.

1558
01:12:38.957 --> 01:12:40.957
- Don't say that, Codge.

1559
01:12:44.381 --> 01:12:47.631
Don't you fucking dare say that, Codge.

1560
01:12:48.648 --> 01:12:50.898
(coughing)

1561
01:12:53.354 --> 01:12:57.821
Fuck!
(coughing)

1562
01:13:00.496 --> 01:13:01.496
- Hey Codge.

1563
01:13:02.794 --> 01:13:06.023
Demi's gonna raise that kid so good.

1564
01:13:06.025 --> 01:13:08.775
(Curly coughing)

1565
01:13:11.264 --> 01:13:12.514
- Thanks Budge.

1566
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.235
- Tell us about the dream, Codge.

1567
01:13:19.237 --> 01:13:20.070
Hey?

1568
01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:23.620
Where it is and everything.

1569
01:13:26.295 --> 01:13:27.128
- So.

1570
01:13:29.783 --> 01:13:32.943
We take a skiff out to paradise,

1571
01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:37.413
tap up all the tourists in Santa Cruz.

1572
01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:42.693
Four on a skiff, fifty bucks a go,

1573
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:46.293
rods and reels thrown in.

1574
01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:49.143
- Braided twenty pound lines.

1575
01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.380
Congenial fucking sunshine.

1576
01:13:55.382 --> 01:13:59.577
- And just the faintest little whiff--

1577
01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:06.229
- [Group] (in unison) Of
tanned California fanny.

1578
01:14:07.814 --> 01:14:10.564
(Curly coughing)

1579
01:14:15.073 --> 01:14:20.073
- You hold fast to that dream, Codge.

1580
01:14:20.727 --> 01:14:21.560
Hold fast.

1581
01:14:29.175 --> 01:14:32.008
(emotional music)

1582
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:35.703
- My dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

1583
01:14:37.290 --> 01:14:39.898
we are gathered here today to celebrate

1584
01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:43.293
the life of a beloved son of Grimsby.

1585
01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:46.143
And it is on this day,

1586
01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:50.013
with love in our heart
and sadness in our soul,

1587
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:55.018
that we bid our last farewell to this man,

1588
01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.703
who had a zest for life.

1589
01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:01.833
Dearly beloved of as many
friends and relations,

1590
01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:05.283
and to the last fiber of his being,

1591
01:15:08.010 --> 01:15:08.843
a Trawlerman.

1592
01:15:11.730 --> 01:15:13.888
- [Curly] I didn't want change.

1593
01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:15.088
But maybe change is the only thing

1594
01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:16.540
we can rely on in this world.

1595
01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:21.270
The planet spins at a
thousand miles an hour,

1596
01:15:23.613 --> 01:15:25.313
and you can't do a thing about it.

1597
01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:42.238
The best you can hope for is

1598
01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.893
someone to hold onto as it spins.

1599
01:15:50.377 --> 01:15:53.161
(emotional music)

1600
01:15:53.163 --> 01:15:58.163
To the ocean we are born, and
to the ocean we must return.

1601
01:16:16.377 --> 01:16:18.543
- [Gilly] Why did they call him Teapot?

1602
01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.370
- Because my mam,

1603
01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:24.808
she hit him over the head with

1604
01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:26.763
a porcelain teapot the day she left.

1605
01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:34.653
That's why he wore that
old wig, to cover the scar.

1606
01:16:38.370 --> 01:16:39.420
Probably deserved it.

1607
01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.390
- What are you gonna do?

1608
01:16:48.690 --> 01:16:49.593
- Job wise?

1609
01:16:50.578 --> 01:16:51.411
I don't know.

1610
01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:57.333
Make a good brew, maybe a
coffee shop will have me.

1611
01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.650
- Doesn't sound like you.

1612
01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:10.360
Have you got a minute, Curly?

1613
01:17:13.530 --> 01:17:15.298
- You're right, you know.

1614
01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:18.779
Things change, and you have
to find a way to move on.

1615
01:17:18.781 --> 01:17:22.170
I was just angry I suppose, you know?

1616
01:17:23.906 --> 01:17:26.788
Just everything related to the fishing

1617
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:28.408
industry had my dad's face on it.

1618
01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:32.998
I just find it hard to move on, you know?

1619
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:33.843
- I understand.

1620
01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:36.510
- Thanks for turning up.

1621
01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:38.428
I reckon if you hadn't,

1622
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:40.703
you'd be scattering my ashes
out there and all by now.

1623
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:43.168
- You might be a bit of a scoundrel,

1624
01:17:43.170 --> 01:17:45.413
but I couldn't let you
burn for that now, could I?

1625
01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:55.558
(tense music)

1626
01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.758
- [Curly] Turns out Gilly's not quite

1627
01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.019
the management suck-up I thought.

1628
01:17:59.021 --> 01:18:01.469
(car engine revving)

1629
01:18:01.471 --> 01:18:02.304
- Fuck!

1630
01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:07.280
- [Gilly] Charlie?

1631
01:18:07.282 --> 01:18:08.255
- Gilly, thank God!

1632
01:18:08.257 --> 01:18:09.157
Thank God.

1633
01:18:09.159 --> 01:18:10.478
I was just closing up, and thing--

1634
01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.402
- Cut the bullshit, Mr. Gee.

1635
01:18:12.404 --> 01:18:13.235
Where's Codge?

1636
01:18:13.237 --> 01:18:14.888
- They're all inside.

1637
01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:16.158
I tried to save them, I did.

1638
01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.158
I must have turned off the
fire alarm with the CCTV.

1639
01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.388
- Come on.

1640
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:22.574
- Demi, it's not safe!

1641
01:18:22.576 --> 01:18:23.531
- Open the fucking doors, Gilly.

1642
01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:25.200
- I've got a better idea.

1643
01:18:26.650 --> 01:18:29.150
(tense music)

1644
01:18:32.131 --> 01:18:35.214
(fire alarm ringing)

1645
01:18:39.412 --> 01:18:41.564
- Come on then, help me!

1646
01:18:41.566 --> 01:18:44.242
(alarm beeping)

1647
01:18:44.244 --> 01:18:45.924
Oi, leave that!

1648
01:18:45.926 --> 01:18:47.135
Put that back!

1649
01:18:47.137 --> 01:18:48.044
Hey?

1650
01:18:48.046 --> 01:18:51.997
I said put that back, put that back now.

1651
01:18:51.999 --> 01:18:53.269
Oi!

1652
01:18:53.271 --> 01:18:56.354
(fire alarm beeping)

1653
01:18:58.369 --> 01:19:02.245
(car engine revving)

1654
01:19:02.247 --> 01:19:03.762
- [Gilly] Come on, Wheezy.

1655
01:19:03.764 --> 01:19:04.748
- I'm on it, Gilly.

1656
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:07.282
- Get them out of here fast.

1657
01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:08.168
- Codge, get up.

1658
01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:10.088
Get up Codge, come on.

1659
01:19:10.090 --> 01:19:12.007
Get up, get in the car.

1660
01:19:12.997 --> 01:19:15.747
(dramatic music)

1661
01:19:18.692 --> 01:19:21.791
(car engine revving)

1662
01:19:21.793 --> 01:19:23.626
- Wait, what about me?

1663
01:19:26.608 --> 01:19:28.768
- So, Curly Dean.

1664
01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:31.953
Tell me, what do you think
we should do with it?

1665
01:19:39.810 --> 01:19:40.833
- Ah, Ms. Devine!

1666
01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:43.801
How lovely to see you again.

1667
01:19:43.803 --> 01:19:44.853
He's just in there.

1668
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:50.703
- Grimsby has a long and
rich industrial heritage.

1669
01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:55.768
A mutually beneficial
partnership with the North Sea,

1670
01:19:55.770 --> 01:19:57.568
and the winds that once powered

1671
01:19:57.570 --> 01:20:00.238
our finest fleet of fishing vessels.

1672
01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:03.028
- Mr. Barr, there's no
future in a fishing net.

1673
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:04.473
We talked about this.

1674
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:13.263
What is this?

1675
01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:17.278
- Hundreds of thousands of square feet

1676
01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.043
of seafood packaging premises.

1677
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.383
And best of all,

1678
01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:28.233
the largest wind turbine
manufacturing plant on the planet.

1679
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:30.748
Free power,

1680
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:33.933
subsidized almost entirely
by Mr Chancellor's purse!

1681
01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:39.633
We all must do our bit, Ms. Devine.

1682
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.968
- Ah, I see!

1683
01:20:42.970 --> 01:20:44.038
Okay, Mr. Barr,

1684
01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.508
you've made your point.

1685
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:48.328
You can send the pissant
politician back to Whitehall now.

1686
01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:51.748
I'm prepared to revisit the profit-share.

1687
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:53.568
How much?

1688
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:56.788
(Donny laughing)

1689
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:59.043
- You still don't get it, do you?

1690
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:06.358
What good is money
without power, Ms. Devine?

1691
01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.518
If I go along with your scheme,

1692
01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.068
I make a quick profit, sure.

1693
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:15.483
But my influence in the town
hall will be mediocre at best.

1694
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:17.806
Whereas with this?

1695
01:21:17.808 --> 01:21:21.088
(laughs)
Yes!

1696
01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:24.028
This will be my empire, no less!

1697
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:27.748
With limitless wind in my sails,

1698
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:32.158
I will become more powerful
than you can ever imagine.

1699
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.948
Sustaining communities and reaping

1700
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:37.773
the rewards from generation to generation.

1701
01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:43.640
Known around the world, the
townspeople will worship me.

1702
01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:46.738
My name will be whispered at every

1703
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:49.815
door along the halls of power.

1704
01:21:49.817 --> 01:21:52.282
Oh, and not only that,

1705
01:21:52.284 --> 01:21:53.201
not only...

1706
01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:57.898
Ms. Devine?

1707
01:21:57.900 --> 01:21:58.833
- Mr. Barr?

1708
01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:01.490
What are you doing?

1709
01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.021
- Make it quick, Gilly.

1710
01:22:07.023 --> 01:22:08.853
I've have the Telegraph coming in.

1711
01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.518
They want to interview the man

1712
01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:13.806
who's putting Grimsby back on the map.

1713
01:22:13.808 --> 01:22:16.058
(chuckles)

1714
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:19.258
Me!

1715
01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:21.363
- Ah, of course.

1716
01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:24.729
(coughs)

1717
01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:31.580
- Mr. Barr, it was actually
me who wanted to speak to you.

1718
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.823
- Oh.

1719
01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.170
Well get on with it, lad.

1720
01:22:38.434 --> 01:22:39.351
- Mr. Barr.

1721
01:22:41.379 --> 01:22:43.130
Look, it was me--

1722
01:22:43.132 --> 01:22:45.688
- Mr. Barr, we just both wanted

1723
01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:48.303
to say good luck with the new venture.

1724
01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:51.688
- Well, we'll need plenty of hard workers,

1725
01:22:51.690 --> 01:22:53.548
so keep in touch, Curly.

1726
01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:55.543
- Look, I don't think you understand--

1727
01:22:55.545 --> 01:22:56.376
- No, no,

1728
01:22:56.378 --> 01:22:57.795
come on, come on.

1729
01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:03.921
- [Donny] Gilly, just a minute.

1730
01:23:03.923 --> 01:23:07.056
(door banging)

1731
01:23:07.058 --> 01:23:08.561
- Yes, Mr. Barr?

1732
01:23:08.563 --> 01:23:11.793
- I just wanted to have a quick
chat if you have the time.

1733
01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:16.113
About the cash.

1734
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:20.578
- Cash?

1735
01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:24.358
- Yes, the cash that that terrible

1736
01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.013
Charlie tried to steal from me.

1737
01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:33.028
The cash that unfortunately
perished in the fire.

1738
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:35.103
As cash indeed would.

1739
01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:37.803
- Mr. Barr?

1740
01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:42.238
- I just thought you'd
be interested to know

1741
01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:44.883
the insurer's paid out
in full on the building.

1742
01:23:46.410 --> 01:23:48.838
In fact, we made a bit of a killing.

1743
01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.578
- That's a relief, Mr. Barr.

1744
01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:52.023
- Yes, isn't it?

1745
01:23:53.970 --> 01:23:55.803
Winners all round.

1746
01:24:04.427 --> 01:24:05.726
- Are you alright, Gilly?

1747
01:24:05.728 --> 01:24:07.108
- Yeah.

1748
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:08.428
Yeah, I think so.

1749
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:09.353
- What's happening?

1750
01:24:09.355 --> 01:24:12.233
I thought you said me confessing
was the right thing to do.

1751
01:24:17.156 --> 01:24:21.323
- I just wanted to know
that you would, if needed.

1752
01:24:30.092 --> 01:24:31.240
(door knocking)

1753
01:24:31.242 --> 01:24:32.075
- Come in!

1754
01:24:38.338 --> 01:24:39.656
- Mr. Barr?

1755
01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:40.558
- Huh?

1756
01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.938
- Just wanted to let
you know we've recovered

1757
01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:43.833
some more data from the access log.

1758
01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:48.178
There's one entry an hour before

1759
01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.828
Gilly Simpson's thumb-print.

1760
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:50.663
- Whose?

1761
01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.433
- Uh...

1762
01:24:54.145 --> 01:24:55.395
Daniel Budgell?

1763
01:24:59.128 --> 01:24:59.961
- Dipshit?

1764
01:25:02.277 --> 01:25:04.360
(laughs)

1765
01:25:17.424 --> 01:25:19.007
- I'm just gonna...

1766
01:25:23.233 --> 01:25:25.316
(laughs)

1767
01:25:26.373 --> 01:25:29.123
(acoustic music)

1768
01:25:34.885 --> 01:25:39.885
♪ One of these days it's
gonna tear you apart ♪

1769
01:25:41.531 --> 01:25:44.728
- But what I've learned
is that I'm utterly

1770
01:25:44.730 --> 01:25:46.923
powerless in the face of my addiction.

1771
01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:48.830
I've, um...

1772
01:25:51.090 --> 01:25:55.863
I've lied to the people I love.

1773
01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:01.353
For some reason or another,
I got another chance,

1774
01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:05.030
and now I'm not gonna waste it.

1775
01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:07.733
Not today.

1776
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:13.379
(group clapping)

1777
01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:24.891
- Yeah, yeah,

1778
01:26:24.893 --> 01:26:26.098
that is brilliant!

1779
01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:27.423
Bitcoin's perfect for us.

1780
01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:29.271
Yeah.

1781
01:26:29.273 --> 01:26:30.303
- It's tempting, mate.

1782
01:26:31.677 --> 01:26:33.903
But I'm trying to make amends.

1783
01:26:34.926 --> 01:26:37.103
Not really sure this
is how you go about it.

1784
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.250
Demi don't wanna know me,

1785
01:26:41.349 --> 01:26:43.463
but the least I can do
is be around for the kid.

1786
01:26:44.610 --> 01:26:46.458
- Well you're not gonna be, are you?

1787
01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.928
You see, if the kid's with Demi,

1788
01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:51.977
and Demi's with us,
crushing it in Santa Cruz,

1789
01:26:51.979 --> 01:26:54.955
then how the hell are you
gonna be on hand for the kid?

1790
01:26:54.957 --> 01:26:56.998
- Did you find your balls then,

1791
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.650
or do you want me to have a look?

1792
01:26:59.610 --> 01:27:01.310
There's room for one more in here.

1793
01:27:03.368 --> 01:27:05.951
(upbeat music)

1794
01:27:07.691 --> 01:27:09.448
- What do you reckon, mate?

1795
01:27:09.450 --> 01:27:11.003
We're gonna go and live the life?

1796
01:27:14.313 --> 01:27:16.896
(upbeat music)

1797
01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:29.308
- [Curly] We couldn't save the
fishing industry in Grimsby.

1798
01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:30.748
No one could.

1799
01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:31.708
See, truth be told,

1800
01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:34.455
it's a miracle that Barr
stuck it out for so long.

1801
01:27:34.457 --> 01:27:36.268
And to the man's credit,

1802
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:38.668
Barr really did put
Grimsby back on the map,

1803
01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:41.008
as a turbine manufacturing extravaganza,

1804
01:27:41.010 --> 01:27:42.415
bringing joy, money,

1805
01:27:42.417 --> 01:27:45.988
and merriment back to the
shores of old Grim once again.

1806
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:47.428
And you can walk along the boats,

1807
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:48.891
from one side of Grimsby to the other,

1808
01:27:48.893 --> 01:27:51.628
albeit on those glorified life rafts,

1809
01:27:51.630 --> 01:27:54.480
looking like a twat in a hi-vis
jumpsuit and a silly hat.

1810
01:27:55.470 --> 01:28:00.470
To the ocean we are born, and
to the ocean we must return.
