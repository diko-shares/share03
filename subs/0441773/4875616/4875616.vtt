00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.120
Legend tells of a legendary warrior

1
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.370
whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

2
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.090
He traveled the land
in search of worthy foes.

3
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.690
I see you like to chew.
Maybe you should chew on my fist!

4
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.270
The warrior said nothing
for his mouth was full.

5
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.530
Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.

6
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.900
Enough talk. Let's fight!

7
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.400
Shashabooey!

8
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.200
He was so deadly in fact

9
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.950
that his enemies would go blind from
overexposure to pure awesomeness.

10
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.250
-My eyes!
-He's too awesome!

11
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.090
And attractive.
How can we repay you?

12
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.300
There is no charge for awesomeness.

13
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.010
Or attractiveness.

14
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.340
Kablooey!

15
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.140
lt mattered not how many foes he faced.

16
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.100
They were no match for his bodacity!

17
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.280
Never before had a panda
been so feared! And so loved.

18
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.790
Even the most heroic heroes in China

19
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.120
the Furious Five

20
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.210
bowed in respect to this great master.

21
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.130
We should hang out.

22
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.340
Agreed.

23
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.300
But hanging out would have to wait.

24
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.800
Because when you're facing
the 10000 demons of Demon Mountain

25
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.600
there's only one thing
that matters and that's...

26
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.270
Po! Get up!

27
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.890
You'll be late for work!

28
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.640
What?

29
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.070
Po! Get up!

30
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.300
Po! What are you doing up there?

31
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.630
Nothing.

32
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.970
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!

33
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.690
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.

34
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.150
Coming!

35
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.700
Sorry Dad.

36
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.580
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

37
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.040
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

38
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.590
Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.

39
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.880
About what?

40
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.550
What were you dreaming about?

41
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.170
What was I...

42
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.010
I was dreaming about

43
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.060
noodles.

44
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.180
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

45
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.810
Yeah. What else
would I be dreaming about?

46
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.360
Careful! That soup is sharp.

47
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.900
Oh happy day!

48
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.860
My son finally having the noodle dream!

49
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.330
You don't know how long I've been
waiting for this moment.

50
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.240
This is a sign Po.

51
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.120
A sign of what?

52
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.830
You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient

53
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.170
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

54
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.380
Then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant!

55
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.930
As I took it over from my father
who took it over from his father

56
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.430
who won it from a friend
in a game of mahjong.

57
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.230
Dad Dad Dad it was just a dream.

58
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.600
No it was the dream.

59
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.230
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

60
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.190
But Dad didn't you ever want
to do something else?

61
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.110
Something besides noodles?

62
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.120
Actually when I was young and crazy

63
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.290
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

64
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.450
Why didn't you?

65
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.330
Because it was a stupid dream.

66
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.540
Can you imagine me making tofu?

67
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.000
Tofu.

68
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.550
No! We all have our place in this world.

69
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.180
Mine is here and yours is...

70
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.470
I know is here.

71
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.680
No it's at tables 2 5 7 and 12.

72
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.850
Service with a smile.

73
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.430
Well done students
if you were trying to disappoint me.

74
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.680
Tigress you need more ferocity!
Monkey greater speed.

75
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.640
Crane height. Viper subtlety. Mantis...

76
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.520
-Master Shifu.
-What?

77
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.060
It's Master Oogway.
He wants to see you.

78
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.450
Master Oogway you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

79
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.210
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

80
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.420
So nothing's wrong?

81
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.130
Well I didn't say that.

82
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.860
You were saying?

83
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.030
I have had a vision.

84
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.830
Tai Lung will return.

85
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.330
That is impossible! He is in prison.

86
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.250
Nothing is impossible.

87
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.090
Zeng!

88
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.510
Fly to Chor Ghom Prison and tell them

89
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.930
to double the guards double
their weapons double everything!

90
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.890
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

91
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.430
Yes Master Shifu!

92
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.270
One often meets his destiny
on the road he takes to avoid it.

93
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.400
We have to do something!

94
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.480
We can't let him march on the valley
and take his revenge!

95
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.570
He'll...

96
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.940
Your mind is like this water my friend.

97
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.450
When it is agitated
it becomes difficult to see.

98
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.620
But if you allow it to settle

99
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.700
the answer becomes clear.

100
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.710
The Dragon Scroll.

101
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.130
It is time.

102
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.920
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

103
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:56.720
To become the Dragon Warrior?

104
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.260
I don't know.

105
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.060
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

106
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.020
Watch it Po!

107
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.610
Sorry. Suck it up!

108
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.780
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

109
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.860
What?

110
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.200
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior! Today!

111
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.450
Everyone! Go! Get to the Jade Palace!

112
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.870
One of the Five
is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!

113
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.580
We've been waiting a thousand years
for this!

114
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.000
Take the bowl!

115
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.420
This is the greatest day
in kung fu history!

116
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.210
Don't worry about it. Just go!

117
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.300
Po! Where are you going?

118
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.510
To the Jade Palace.

119
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.890
You're forgetting your noodle cart.

120
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:40.520
The whole valley will be there
and you'll sell noodles to all of them.

121
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.020
Selling noodles?

122
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.940
But Dad I was thinking maybe I...

123
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.150
-Yeah?
-I was thinking maybe I...

124
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.530
...could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

125
00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.330
That's my boy!

126
00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.620
I told you that dream was a sign.

127
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.750
Yeah. Glad I had it.

128
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.340
-I'm a kung fu warrior!
-Me too!

129
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.970
-There's spots at the top.
-Let's go.

130
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.210
Come on. Come on!

131
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.130
Almost there.

132
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.380
What?

133
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.130
No! Oh no!

134
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.010
-Sorry Po.
-We'll bring you back a souvenir.

135
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.980
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

136
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.570
It is an historic day.

137
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.410
Isn't it Master Oogway?

138
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:24.330
Yes and one I feared
I would not live to see.

139
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.410
Are your students ready?

140
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.250
Yes Master Oogway.

141
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.130
Know this old friend.

142
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:35.550
Whomever I choose will not only bring
peace to the valley

143
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.260
but also to you.

144
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.720
Let the tournament begin!

145
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.570
Yeah.

146
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.320
No no wait!

147
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.740
I'm coming! Wait wait!

148
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.080
Yes!

149
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.250
Hey! Open the door!

150
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.420
Let me in!

151
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.050
Citizens of the Valley of Peace

152
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.640
it is my great honor
to present to you Tigress!

153
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.930
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!

154
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.600
The Furious Five!

155
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.570
Yeah the Furious Five!

156
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.200
Warriors prepare!

157
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.830
Wait. No. Oh peeky-hole.

158
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.250
-Ready for battle!
-Yeah.

159
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.290
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

160
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.710
Look at that.

161
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.800
Hey! Get out of the way!

162
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.420
And finally Master Tigress!

163
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.260
Believe me citizens
you have not seen anything yet.

164
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.590
I know!

165
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.760
Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox
and his Blades of Death.

166
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.700
I sense the Dragon Warrior
is among us.

167
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.830
Citizens of the Valley of Peace

168
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:18.460
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior!

169
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.590
Oh no! No no wait!

170
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.380
Yeah.

171
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.900
Po!

172
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.900
What are you doing?

173
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.530
What does it look like I'm doing? Stop!

174
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.570
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

175
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:56.000
But I don't understand.
You finally had the noodle dream!

176
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.920
I lied. I don't dream about noodles Dad.

177
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.300
I love kung fu!

178
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:23.320
Come on son. Let's get back to work.

179
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.320
Okay.

180
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.160
Come back!

181
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.190
What's going on?

182
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.690
Where...

183
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.610
What are you pointing...

184
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.320
Okay. Sorry.

185
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.870
I just wanted to see
who the Dragon Warrior was.

186
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.870
How interesting.

187
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.250
Master are you pointing at me?

188
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.330
-Him.
-Who?

189
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.550
-You.
-Me?

190
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:32.130
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior!

191
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.760
-What?
-What?

192
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.550
-What?
-What?

193
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.030
Stop wait! Who told you to...

194
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.040
Master Oogway wait.

195
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.420
That flabby panda can't possibly be
the answer to our problem.

196
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.210
You were about to point at Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her!

197
00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.710
That was just an accident!

198
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.550
There are no accidents.

199
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.440
Forgive us Master. We have failed you.

200
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.820
No. If the panda has not quit
by morning

201
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.240
then I will have failed you.

202
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.260
Wait! Wait wait wait!
I bring a message

203
00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.600
from Master Shifu.

204
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.390
What?

205
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.810
"Double the guard"?

206
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.690
"Extra precautions"?

207
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.110
"Your prison may not be adequate"?

208
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.660
You doubt my prison security?

209
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.570
Absolutely not.

210
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.790
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

211
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:25.500
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

212
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.290
Escape from Chor Ghom Prison
is impossible!

213
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.180
Impressive isn't it?

214
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.220
It's very impressive.

215
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.760
It's very impressive.

216
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.520
One way in one way out.

217
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.690
One thousand guards and one prisoner.

218
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.270
Yes except that prisoner

219
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.070
is Tai Lung.

220
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.860
Take us down.

221
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.830
What are you doing?

222
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.630
Oh my.

223
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.970
Behold Tai Lung.

224
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.690
I'm just gonna wait right here.

225
00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:34.070
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

226
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.400
Crossbows! At the ready!

227
00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.280
Crossbows?

228
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.910
Hey tough guy did you hear?

229
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:45.450
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon
Scroll and it's not gonna be you.

230
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.200
Don't get him mad.

231
00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:52.080
What's he gonna do about it?
I've got him completely immobilized.

232
00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.010
Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

233
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.930
I'm good. I've seen enough.

234
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.430
I'll tell Shifu
he has nothing to worry about.

235
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.720
No he doesn't.

236
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.020
I'll tell him that.

237
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.980
Can we please go now?

238
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.250
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

239
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.130
Wait a second!

240
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.800
I think there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm...

241
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.100
The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!

242
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.480
Look at this place.

243
00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:01.110
Master Flying Rhino's armor
with authentic battle damage!

244
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.030
The Sword of Heroes!

245
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.370
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself
just by looking...

246
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.120
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

247
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.960
I've only seen paintings of that painting.

248
00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.800
No!

249
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.890
The Legendary Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

250
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.140
Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu army.

251
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.610
Hello.

252
00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.030
Have you finished sight-seeing?

253
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.190
Sorry I should have come to you first.

254
00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.240
My patience is wearing thin.

255
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.120
Well I mean it's not like
you were going anywhere.

256
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.580
-Would you turn around?
-Sure.

257
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.660
How's it going?

258
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.160
How do you get 5000... Master Shifu!

259
00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.540
Someone broke that.

260
00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.000
But I'll fix it. Do you have some

261
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.210
glue?

262
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.220
A splinter.

263
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.260
So you're the legendary
Dragon Warrior?

264
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:12.470
-I guess so.
-Wrong!

265
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.810
You are not the Dragon Warrior.

266
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.270
You will never be
the Dragon Warrior until

267
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.310
you have learned the secret
of the Dragon Scroll.

268
00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.940
So how does this work?

269
00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.910
Do you have a ladder
or a trampoline or...

270
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:32.290
You think it's that easy?
That I'll just hand you the secret

271
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.250
-to limitless power?
-No I...

272
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.330
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

273
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.460
And that is clearly impossible
if that one is someone like you.

274
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.590
Someone like me?

275
00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:47.300
Yes look at you!
This fat butt! Flabby arms!

276
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.850
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

277
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.760
And this ridiculous belly.

278
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:56.100
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

279
00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.310
Now wait a minute. That's uncalled for.

280
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.940
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

281
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.940
Listen Oogway said I was...

282
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.690
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

283
00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.490
Oh you know this hold?

284
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:11.240
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty. Yes.

285
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.080
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

286
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.620
-No no!
-You know the hardest part of this?

287
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.540
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards.

288
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.750
Okay okay take it easy.

289
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.260
Now listen closely panda.

290
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.470
Oogway may have picked you
but when I'm through with you

291
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:34.430
I promise you you're going to wish
he hadn't! Are we clear?

292
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.730
Yeah we're clear. We're so clear.

293
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:39.520
Good.

294
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.400
I can't wait to get started.

295
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.480
-Let's begin.
-Wait wait wait.

296
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.110
What?

297
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.110
-Now?
-Yes now.

298
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:33.490
Unless the great Oogway was wrong
and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

299
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:35.120
Oh okay well...

300
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.200
I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

301
00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.040
Well if we don't try
we'll never know will we?

302
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.920
Yeah it's just maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

303
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.090
What level is that?

304
00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.590
Well I'm not a master but

305
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.430
let's just start at zero. Level zero.

306
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.600
No. There is no such thing
as level zero.

307
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.430
-Maybe I can start with that.
-That?

308
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.650
We use that for training children and
propping the door open when it's hot.

309
00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.110
But if you insist...

310
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.780
The Furious Five!

311
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.990
You're so much bigger
than your action figures.

312
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:15.490
Except for you Mantis.
You're about the same.

313
00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.120
Go ahead panda.
Show us what you can do.

314
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.580
Are they gonna watch or should I wait
till they get back to work or something?

315
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:26.750
Hit it.

316
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.130
Okay yeah. I mean I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

317
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.970
So my kung fu might not be
as good as later on.

318
00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:36.220
Just hit it.

319
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.430
All right.

320
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.520
What you got? You got nothing
'cause I got it right here.

321
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.520
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel thunder.

322
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.900
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.
What you gonna do about crazy feet?

323
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.980
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

324
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.820
You've only seen praying mantis.

325
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.860
Or monkey style.

326
00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:57.820
Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

327
00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.290
Would you hit it!

328
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.580
All right. All right.

329
00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.420
Why don't you try again? A little harder.

330
00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.300
How's that?

331
00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.520
That hurts.

332
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.700
This will be easier than I thought.

333
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.280
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

334
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.030
Those are hard!

335
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.210
My tenders.

336
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.070
How did I do?

337
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.610
There is now a level zero.

338
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.410
-There's no words.
-No denying that.

339
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.790
I don't understand
what Master Oogway was thinking.

340
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.160
The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

341
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.750
He is so mighty!

342
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.630
The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire!

343
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.550
When he walks
the very ground shakes!

344
00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:42.800
One would think Master Oogway would
choose someone who knew kung fu.

345
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.930
Yeah or could at least touch his toes.

346
00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.390
Or even see his toes.

347
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.000
Okay.

348
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.430
Great.

349
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.690
Hi. You're up.

350
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.150
I am now.

351
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.990
I was just...

352
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.330
Some day huh?

353
00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:49.790
That kung fu stuff is hard work right?
Are your biceps sore?

354
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:55.040
I've had a long
and rather disappointing day so...

355
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:59.090
Yeah I should probably
get to sleep now.

356
00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.590
-Yeah yeah yeah. Of course.
-Okay thanks.

357
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.340
It's just... Man I'm such a big fan!

358
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.010
You guys were amazing
at the Battle of Weeping River.

359
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.600
Outnumbered a thousand to one
but you didn't stop. You just...

360
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.020
Sorry about that.

361
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.610
Look you don't belong here.

362
00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.660
I know. I know. You're right.

363
00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.780
I don't have... I just...

364
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.370
My whole life I dreamed of...

365
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:32.330
No I meant you don't belong here.
I mean in this room. This is my room.

366
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.750
Property of Crane.

367
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.710
Okay. Right right.

368
00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.300
So you want to get to sleep.

369
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.170
-Yeah.
-I'm keeping you up.

370
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.380
We got big things tomorrow.

371
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:48.640
All right. You're awesome.
Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

372
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.640
What was that?

373
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.150
I didn't say anything.

374
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.400
Okay. All right. Good night.

375
00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.650
Sleep well.

376
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.320
That seemed a little awkward.

377
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.740
Master Tigress!
I didn't mean to wake you.

378
00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.540
-You don't belong here.
-Yeah of course.

379
00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.910
This is your room.

380
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.250
I mean you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

381
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.540
You're a disgrace to kung fu
and if you have

382
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.250
any respect for who we are
and what we do

383
00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.720
you will be gone by morning.

384
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.010
Big fan!

385
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:42.190
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

386
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:49.280
Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought
it was just a regular peach tree.

387
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:54.290
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

388
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:58.370
Upset? I'm not upset.
What makes you think I'm upset.

389
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.050
So why are you upset?

390
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:10.680
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of kung fu.

391
00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.390
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

392
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.560
Probably.

393
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:19.310
And the Five! Man you should've
seen them! They totally hate me.

394
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.400
Totally.

395
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.570
How is Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?

396
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.570
I mean I'm not like the Five.

397
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.200
I've got no claws no wings no venom.

398
00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.250
Even Mantis has those thingies.

399
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:40.250
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

400
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.760
Quit don't quit.

401
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.680
Noodles don't noodles.

402
00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.390
You are too concerned
with what was and what will be.

403
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.350
There's a saying.

404
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.270
Yesterday is history

405
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.600
tomorrow is a mystery

406
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.610
but today is a gift.

407
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:07.490
That is why it is called the present.

408
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.850
-Oh no!
-What's happening?

409
00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.440
To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

410
00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.780
Fire crossbows!

411
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.200
Fire!

412
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:57.870
Fire!

413
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.250
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

414
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.260
You're not going anywhere!
Neither is he!

415
00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.180
-Let go of me!
-Bring it up!

416
00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.640
Wait! Bring it back!

417
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:39.410
-He's coming this way!
-He won't get far. Archers!

418
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:50.440
We're dead. So very very dead.

419
00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:53.230
Not yet we're not. Now!

420
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:43.660
-Can we run now?
-Yes.

421
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.680
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

422
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.770
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

423
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.900
Fly back there and tell them

424
00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.690
the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

425
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.210
-Good morning Master!
-Good morning Master!

426
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.290
Panda!

427
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.380
Panda!

428
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:35.960
Wake up!

429
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:40.720
He's quit.

430
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.720
What do we do now Master
with the panda gone?

431
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:47.810
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

432
00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:50.980
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time

433
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.690
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

434
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.730
What are you doing here?

435
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.650
Hi! Good morning Master!

436
00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.570
I thought I'd warm up a little.

437
00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:04.700
You're stuck.

438
00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.160
Stuck? No. What? Stuck?

439
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.960
No. This is one of my... Yeah I'm stuck.

440
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.960
-Help him.
-Oh dear.

441
00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.590
Maybe on three. One two

442
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:18.840
three.

443
00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.260
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

444
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.510
-No really I appreciate...
-Ever.

445
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.640
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

446
00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.850
It takes years to develop one's flexibility!

447
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.730
And years longer to apply it in combat!

448
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.870
Put that down!

449
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:52.410
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

450
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.460
Yeah! Excellent.

451
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.460
Let's get started.

452
00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.630
-Are you ready?
-I was born ready...

453
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.640
I'm sorry brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

454
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.010
That was awesome! Let's go again!

455
00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:39.290
I've been taking it easy on you panda.
But no more.

456
00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.710
Your next opponent will be me.

457
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.550
All right! Yeah let's go!

458
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.430
Step forth.

459
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.640
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness

460
00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.600
and make him suffer for it.

461
00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.980
Oh yeah!

462
00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.440
To take his strength
and use it against him

463
00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.980
until he finally falls

464
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:02.070
or quits.

465
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.190
A real warrior never quits.

466
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.490
Don't worry Master. I will never quit!

467
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:20.880
If he's smart
he won't come back up those steps.

468
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.300
But he will.

469
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.630
He's not going to quit is he?

470
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:27.510
He's not going to quit bouncing
I'll tell you that.

471
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.440
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

472
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.520
Trust me it will.

473
00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:47.240
It's just not easy finding the right
nerve points under all this...

474
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.990
-Fat?
-Fur. I was going to say fur.

475
00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:51.030
Sure you were.

476
00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.200
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? Look at me.

477
00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:57.370
I'm over here.

478
00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.880
Maybe you should look at this again.

479
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.420
Oh okay.

480
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.260
Stop it. Stop!

481
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.390
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all

482
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.270
but if I didn't know any better
I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

483
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.610
I know he can seem kind of heartless

484
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:26.190
but he wasn't always like that.

485
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.610
According to legend

486
00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:32.200
there was once a time when
Master Shifu actually used to smile.

487
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.200
-No!
-Yes.

488
00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.530
But that was before.

489
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.620
Before what?

490
00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.040
Before Tai Lung.

491
00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.710
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

492
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:44.750
Well if he's going to stay here
he should know.

493
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.750
Guys guys I know about Tai Lung.

494
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:52.300
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

495
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:56.560
And then he turned bad
and now he's in jail.

496
00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.770
He wasn't just a student.

497
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.940
Shifu found him as a cub

498
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.490
and he raised him as his son.

499
00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.950
And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu

500
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.290
Shifu trained him.

501
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:23.500
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

502
00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:26.960
lt was never enough for Tai Lung.

503
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.300
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

504
00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:36.180
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

505
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:40.220
Outraged Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.

506
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.730
He tried to take the scroll by force.

507
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:49.400
And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.

508
00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:52.280
But how could he?

509
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.670
Shifu loved Tai Lung
like he had never loved anyone before.

510
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:20.180
Or since.

511
00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:31.820
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

512
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.150
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

513
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.910
And he's stuck with you.

514
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:40.870
A big fat panda who treats it like a joke.

515
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:42.870
That is it!

516
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:46.080
Wait! My fault!
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

517
00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.880
And may have also stopped his heart.

518
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:56.220
Inner peace.

519
00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.680
Inner peace.

520
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:04.100
Inner...

521
00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:07.600
Inner peace.

522
00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:15.110
Would whoever is making
that flapping sound quiet down?

523
00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.620
Inner...

524
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:26.290
Oh Zeng.

525
00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:27.960
Excellent.

526
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.960
I could use some good news right now.

527
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.130
Master! Master!

528
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:44.060
I have... It's... It's very bad news.

529
00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.480
Shifu.

530
00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.310
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

531
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.690
Master your vision...
Your vision was right.

532
00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:57.150
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

533
00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:01.370
That is bad news

534
00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:05.830
if you do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

535
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:10.170
The panda? Master
that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

536
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:13.540
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

537
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:15.920
There are no accidents.

538
00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:20.260
Yes I know. You've said that already.

539
00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:24.560
-Twice.
-Well that was no accident either.

540
00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:25.720
Thrice.

541
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:27.430
My old friend

542
00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:32.100
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny nor you yours

543
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:35.730
until you let go of the illusion of control.

544
00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.150
Illusion?

545
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:40.240
Yes. Look at this tree Shifu.

546
00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.320
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me

547
00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:46.660
nor make it bear fruit before its time.

548
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.290
But there are things we can control.

549
00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:53.460
I can control when the fruit will fall.

550
00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.210
And I can control

551
00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.300
where to plant the seed.

552
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.880
That is no illusion Master.

553
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.600
Yes.

554
00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.060
But no matter what you do

555
00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:11.060
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

556
00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:15.980
You may wish for an apple
or an orange but you will get a peach.

557
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.690
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

558
00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:22.450
Maybe it can.

559
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:25.320
If you are willing to guide it.

560
00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:27.240
To nurture it.

561
00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:28.700
To believe in it.

562
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:31.250
But how? How?

563
00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:33.290
I need your help Master.

564
00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:37.090
No you just need to believe.

565
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.090
Promise me Shifu.

566
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:43.340
Promise me you will believe.

567
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:47.010
I will try.

568
00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.350
Good.

569
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:53.520
My time has come.

570
00:44:55.730 --> 00:45:00.070
You must continue
your journey without me.

571
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:01.860
What are you... Wait!

572
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.200
Master!

573
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.620
You can't leave me!

574
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:14.000
You must believe.

575
00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.540
Master!

576
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:49.620
Yeah so I'm like
"Fine you may be a wolf

577
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.660
"you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province

578
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.790
"but you're a lousy tipper."

579
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:57.830
Really? So how did you
get out of there alive?

580
00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.000
I mean I didn't actually say that

581
00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:02.840
but I thought it

582
00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.670
in my mind.

583
00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.840
If he could read my mind
he'd be like "What?"

584
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.550
Order up! Hope you like it.

585
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:15.680
-This is really good!
-No come on.

586
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:20.060
Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

587
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:22.520
What are you talking about?
This is amazing!

588
00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:25.530
-You're a really good cook.
-I wish my mouth was bigger.

589
00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:27.490
Tigress you've got to try this.

590
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:31.200
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months at a time

591
00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.830
on nothing but the dew
of a single ginkgo leaf

592
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:35.660
and the energy of the universe.

593
00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:41.340
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

594
00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:46.420
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

595
00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.890
-What?
-Nothing Master Shifu.

596
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:58.230
You'll never be the Dragon Warrior

597
00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:00.900
unless you lose 500 pounds
and brush your teeth!

598
00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.480
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

599
00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.360
Work hard panda and maybe someday

600
00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:10.360
you will have ears like mine.

601
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:13.370
That's good.

602
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:17.370
Ears. It's not working for you?
I thought they were pretty good.

603
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:18.830
It's Shifu!

604
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:21.750
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

605
00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.130
Master Shifu!

606
00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:29.840
You think this is funny?

607
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.890
Tai Lung has escaped
and you're acting like children!

608
00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:35.260
-What?
-He is coming for the Dragon Scroll

609
00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:37.720
and you are the only one
who can stop him.

610
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.020
And here I am saying
you got no sense of humor.

611
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:46.360
I'm gonna stop Tai Lung.

612
00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.280
What? You're serious? And I have to...

613
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:54.120
Master Oogway will stop him
he did it before he'll do it again.

614
00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.740
Oogway cannot!

615
00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.620
Not anymore.

616
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.710
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

617
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:03.460
-The panda?
-Yes the panda!

618
00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:07.130
Master let us stop Tai Lung.
This is what you've trained us for.

619
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:10.420
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

620
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:12.760
It is his!

621
00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.970
Where'd he go?

622
00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:24.440
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits.

623
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.110
Watch me.

624
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.610
Come on.

625
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:33.530
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

626
00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.620
You will beat him
because you are the Dragon Warrior.

627
00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:40.660
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

628
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:43.750
From the beginning
you've tried to get rid of me.

629
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:46.130
Yes! I was.

630
00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:51.340
But now I ask you to trust in your master
as I have come to trust in mine.

631
00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:56.140
You're not my master.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

632
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.850
Then why didn't you quit?

633
00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:00.560
You knew I was trying to get rid of you
yet you stayed.

634
00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.730
Yeah I stayed.

635
00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:06.560
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

636
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:11.030
or said I smelled it hurt
but it could never hurt more

637
00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:14.360
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

638
00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:19.660
I stayed because I thought
if anyone could change me

639
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:23.040
could make me not me

640
00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.500
it was you

641
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:27.670
the greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China!

642
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:29.340
But I can change you!

643
00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.970
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior!
And I will!

644
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:37.010
Come on. Tai Lung is
on his way here right now.

645
00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:40.470
Even if it takes him a hundred years
to get here how are you

646
00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.850
gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

647
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.440
How?

648
00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:51.070
How?

649
00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.030
-How?
-I don't know!

650
00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.620
I don't know.

651
00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:14.420
That's what I thought.

652
00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.260
This is what you trained me for.

653
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:03.390
Tigress!

654
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.440
Don't try and stop me.

655
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:13.690
We're not trying to stop you.

656
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:14.730
What?

657
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.690
We're coming with you!

658
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:33.480
What? I eat when I'm upset okay?

659
00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.940
No need to explain.

660
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:37.520
I thought you might be Monkey.

661
00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:40.320
He hides his almond cookies
on the top shelf.

662
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:02.880
Don't tell Monkey.

663
00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:06.140
-Look at you.
-Yeah I know I disgust you.

664
00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:09.180
No I mean how did you get up there?

665
00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.060
I don't know. I guess...

666
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:14.690
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

667
00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:16.650
Yet you are ten feet off the ground.

668
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:20.030
And have done a perfect spilt.

669
00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:23.070
No this? This is just

670
00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.110
an accident.

671
00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:32.410
There are no accidents.

672
00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:33.580
Come with me.

673
00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:45.010
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey

674
00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:47.800
but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

675
00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:00.190
You dragged me

676
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.940
all the way out here

677
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:03.440
for a bath?

678
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:08.280
Panda

679
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:11.990
we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

680
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:14.250
The Pool of...

681
00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:17.250
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries

682
00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:19.210
of harmony and focus.

683
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:21.800
This is the birthplace

684
00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.170
of kung fu.

685
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.400
Do you want to learn kung fu?

686
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.440
Yeah!

687
00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.030
Then I am your master!

688
00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:45.690
Okay!

689
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:48.070
Don't cry.

690
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:49.490
Okay.

691
00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.210
When you focus on kung fu

692
00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:59.420
when you concentrate

693
00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.170
you stink.

694
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:02.960
Perhaps that is my fault.

695
00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:06.510
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

696
00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:09.680
I now see that the way
to get through to you

697
00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.050
is with this.

698
00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:13.890
Oh great 'cause I am hungry.

699
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:15.850
Good.

700
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:18.640
When you have been trained
you may eat.

701
00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:21.100
Let us begin.

702
00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.090
After you panda.

703
00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.140
Just like that?

704
00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:38.720
No sit-ups? No 10-mile hike?

705
00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:43.310
I vowed to train you and you
have been trained. You are free to eat.

706
00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:50.320
Enjoy.

707
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.320
Hey!

708
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:56.530
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

709
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:59.330
Hey!

710
00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.500
You are free to eat.

711
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.500
-Am I?
-Are you?

712
00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.470
I'm not hungry.

713
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.260
Master.

714
00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:13.800
Cut it!

715
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.770
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

716
00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:35.860
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

717
00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:38.110
You think I'm a fool?

718
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:41.820
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

719
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:45.160
I heard how he fell out of the sky
in a ball of fire.

720
00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:49.660
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

721
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:55.340
-Po?
-So that is his name. Po.

722
00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:58.510
Finally a worthy opponent.

723
00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:01.090
Our battle will be legendary!

724
01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:22.780
We've got this. Help her.

725
01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.560
Monkey!

726
01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.480
Go!

727
01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:51.730
What was I thinking?

728
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:03.240
Mantis!

729
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.370
Now!

730
01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:57.580
Shifu taught you well.

731
01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.550
But he didn't teach you everything.

732
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:08.140
You have done well panda.

733
01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.890
Done well? Done well?

734
01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:13.310
I've done awesome!

735
01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:18.190
The mark of a true hero is humility.

736
01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:20.980
But yes you have done

737
01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:22.900
awesome.

738
01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.450
Guys? Guys? They're dead!

739
01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:36.960
No they're breathing. They're asleep?
No their eyes are open.

740
01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.040
We were no match for his nerve attack.

741
01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:41.340
He's gotten stronger.

742
01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.710
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

743
01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.470
He's too fast!

744
01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:48.130
Sorry Po.

745
01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.180
I thought we could stop him.

746
01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.100
He could have killed you.

747
01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:54.220
Why didn't he?

748
01:02:54.310 --> 01:02:59.100
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

749
01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:03.110
It might. I mean a little.

750
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:04.440
I'm pretty scared.

751
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:05.990
You can defeat him panda!

752
01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:08.990
Are you kidding? If they can't?

753
01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:12.070
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

754
01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.540
But you will have
the one thing that no one else does.

755
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.340
You really believe I'm ready?

756
01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.090
You are

757
01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:26.460
Po.

758
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:19.020
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

759
01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.020
It is yours.

760
01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:24.020
Wait. What happens when I read it?

761
01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.110
No one knows.

762
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:28.150
But legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

763
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:30.440
Really? That's cool.

764
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:33.360
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

765
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:36.330
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

766
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:38.410
Can I punch through walls?

767
01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.870
-Can I do a quadruple back flip?
-Focus.

768
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.120
-Will I have invisibility...
-Focus.

769
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:43.920
-Focus.
-Oh yeah yeah.

770
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.880
Read it Po and fulfill your destiny.

771
01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.170
Read it and become

772
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.970
the Dragon Warrior.

773
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:59.310
It's impossible to open.

774
01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:03.600
Okay. Come on baby. Come on now.

775
01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:07.440
Thank you.

776
01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.940
I probably loosened it up for you though.

777
01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.780
Okay here goes.

778
01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.420
-It's blank.
-What?

779
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:30.130
-Here look.
-No I am forbidden to look upon...

780
01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.680
Blank. I don't...

781
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.970
I don't understand.

782
01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:44.940
Okay. So like

783
01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:48.270
Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

784
01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.940
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

785
01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:55.070
Oh come on! Face it
he picked me by accident.

786
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:59.280
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?

787
01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:01.990
But who will stop Tai Lung?

788
01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:05.120
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

789
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:06.620
No.

790
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:12.050
Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

791
01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:14.510
-What about you Master?
-I will fight him.

792
01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:17.300
-What?
-I can hold him off long enough

793
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.800
for everyone to escape.

794
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:21.310
But Shifu he'll kill you.

795
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:24.230
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

796
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:27.310
Listen to me all of you.

797
01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.900
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

798
01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:33.990
I am very proud
to have been your master.

799
01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.130
We've got to get them out safely.

800
01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.510
Come little one. Let's find your mama.

801
01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:03.180
Viper gather the southern farmers.
Mantis the north.

802
01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.020
Crane light the way.

803
01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.120
Look it's the Dragon Warrior.

804
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.210
Hey Dad.

805
01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.130
Po!

806
01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:47.140
Good to have you back son.

807
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.060
Good to be back.

808
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:52.810
Let's go Po.

809
01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:58.110
So for our next shop it's time to face it

810
01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:01.700
the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables

811
01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:04.240
no longer slices.

812
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:07.580
Also I was thinking maybe this time

813
01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:11.080
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

814
01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:13.500
You like that?

815
01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:24.300
Po I'm sorry things didn't work out.

816
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:27.430
It just wasn't meant to be.

817
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:33.400
Po forget everything else.

818
01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.650
Your destiny still awaits.

819
01:08:35.730 --> 01:08:40.860
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

820
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.860
I don't know Dad.

821
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:46.950
Honestly sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

822
01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:51.410
Po

823
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:55.920
I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you

824
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.050
a long time ago.

825
01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:00.510
Okay.

826
01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:05.430
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

827
01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:12.810
Come here. The secret ingredient is

828
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:13.890
nothing.

829
01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:17.690
You heard me. Nothing!

830
01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:20.230
There is no secret ingredient!

831
01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.360
Wait wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

832
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:25.950
You don't add some kind of
special sauce or something?

833
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:28.330
Don't have to.
To make something special

834
01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:31.410
you just have to believe it's special.

835
01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.970
There is no secret ingredient.

836
01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:09.370
I have come home Master.

837
01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:12.700
This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.

838
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:16.710
Oh yes. You have a new favorite.

839
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:19.880
So where is this Po?

840
01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.550
Did I scare him off?

841
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:24.970
This battle is between you and me.

842
01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:29.470
So that is how it's going to be.

843
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:31.600
That is how it must be.

844
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:50.570
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

845
01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:53.040
Obeying your master is not weakness!

846
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.910
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

847
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.120
You always knew.

848
01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:03.210
But when Oogway said otherwise
what did you do?

849
01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.880
What did you do?

850
01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:10.430
Nothing!

851
01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:13.350
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

852
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:15.180
Not your fault?

853
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.390
Who filled my head with dreams?

854
01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.810
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?

855
01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.650
Who denied me my destiny?

856
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:34.490
It was never my decision to make!

857
01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.250
It is now.

858
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.880
Give me the scroll!

859
01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:51.220
I would rather die.

860
01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.730
All I ever did I did to make you proud!

861
01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:47.400
Tell me how proud you are Shifu!

862
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.860
Tell me!

863
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.110
Tell me!

864
01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:05.790
I have...
I have always been proud of you.

865
01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:10.210
From the first moment I've been

866
01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.590
proud of you.

867
01:13:12.670 --> 01:13:15.050
And it was my pride

868
01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.140
that blinded me.

869
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:20.810
I loved you too much
to see what you were becoming

870
01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:24.060
what I

871
01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.150
was turning you into.

872
01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:28.900
I'm...

873
01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:29.980
I'm sorry.

874
01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:41.200
I don't want your apology.

875
01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:42.830
I want my scroll!

876
01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.920
What?

877
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.210
Where is it?

878
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:54.170
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll
halfway across China by now.

879
01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:58.430
You will never see that scroll Tai Lung.

880
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:59.850
Never.

881
01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.770
Never.

882
01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:10.070
Stairs.

883
01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:14.280
Who are you?

884
01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:19.410
Buddy I am the Dragon Warrior.

885
01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:23.750
You?

886
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.670
Him? He's a panda.

887
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:30.630
You're a panda. What are
you gonna do big guy? Sit on me?

888
01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:32.630
Don't tempt me.

889
01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:36.720
No. I'm gonna use this.

890
01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.430
You want it? Come and get it.

891
01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:41.470
Finally!

892
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.960
That scroll is mine!

893
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.800
Lightning!

894
01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:41.010
The scroll has given him power!

895
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.220
No!

896
01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:23.260
Finally! Oh yes.

897
01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:28.220
The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

898
01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:35.060
It's nothing!

899
01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:39.610
It's okay. I didn't get it
the first time either.

900
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:41.150
What?

901
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.110
There is no secret ingredient.

902
01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:48.910
It's just you.

903
01:17:58.670 --> 01:17:59.710
Stop it!

904
01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.590
I'm gonna pee.

905
01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.380
Don't.

906
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:06.130
Don't! Don't!

907
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:15.700
You

908
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:18.000
can't defeat me.

909
01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:23.670
You...

910
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.800
You're just a big

911
01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.470
fat

912
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:29.550
panda!

913
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:33.640
I'm not a big fat panda.

914
01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:36.020
I'm the big fat panda.

915
01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:39.600
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

916
01:19:39.690 --> 01:19:41.100
Oh you know this hold?

917
01:19:41.190 --> 01:19:45.110
You're bluffing. You're bluffing.
Shifu didn't teach you that.

918
01:19:45.190 --> 01:19:46.900
Nope.

919
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:49.200
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

920
01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:10.930
Look!

921
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:14.050
The Dragon Warrior.

922
01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:46.420
That's my boy! That big lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

923
01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:49.590
Yes!

924
01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.430
Thanks Dad.

925
01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.480
Hey guys.

926
01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:09.110
Master.

927
01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:10.610
-Master.
-Master.

928
01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:15.280
Master?

929
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:16.830
Master Shifu!

930
01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:31.840
Master!

931
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.010
Shifu are you okay?

932
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.140
Po.

933
01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:39.140
You're alive.

934
01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:40.430
Or we're both dead.

935
01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:44.440
No Master I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.

936
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.650
You did?

937
01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:55.660
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

938
01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:59.240
You are the Dragon Warrior.

939
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:02.500
You have brought peace

940
01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:05.330
to this valley

941
01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:07.580
and...

942
01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:09.290
And to me.

943
01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:10.670
Thank you.

944
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:15.720
Thank you Po.

945
01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:18.390
Thank you. Thank you.

946
01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:28.900
No! Master! No no no
don't die Shifu please!

947
01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:31.690
I'm not dying you idiot!

948
01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.740
Dragon Warrior.

949
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:39.870
I am simply at peace. Finally.

950
01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:45.540
So I should stop talking?

951
01:22:46.210 --> 01:22:47.870
If you can.

952
01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:07.600
Want to get something to eat?

953
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:11.400
Yeah.

954
01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.780
Everybody is kung fu fighting

955
01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:24.950
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

956
01:23:25.950 --> 01:23:29.290
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

957
01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:33.960
lt's the book of your life
that you're writing

958
01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:40.140
Everybody is kung fu fighting

959
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:44.640
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

960
01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.980

is a little bit frightening

961
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:53.310
lt's the book of your life
that you're writing

962
01:23:55.150 --> 01:23:57.360
You are a natural

963
01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.650
Why is that so hard to see?

964
01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:03.910
Maybe it's just because
You keep on looking at me

965
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:08.080
The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know

966
01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:12.040
But sometimes you've got to go
And be your own hero

967
01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:15.090
Everybody is kung fu fighting

968
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:19.510
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

969
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:23.970

lt's the book of your life
that you're writing

971
01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:34.230
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

972
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:38.400
You could be a work of art
lf you just go all the way

973
01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:42.280
Now what would it take to break?
l believe that you can bend

974
01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:46.740
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

975
01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:49.950
'Cause everybody is kung fu fighting

976
01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:54.290
