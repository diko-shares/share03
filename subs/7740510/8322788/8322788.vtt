00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:26.397
Daddy, I heard something.

2
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:28.858
- Oh, yeah? What'd you hear?
- A noise.

3
00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:32.904
Oh, it's just us working.

4
00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:34.447
Why can't I come in with you?

5
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.699
'Cause I said so.
Ain't a place for kids.

6
00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:38.534
We're almost done now.

7
00:02:38.618 --> 00:02:41.287
Do not leave this truck.
Or drive off with it.

8
00:02:42.163 --> 00:02:43.498
You hear me?

9
00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:48.753
Go and put that in the glove box.

10
00:02:50.088 --> 00:02:51.547
I'll be right back, bud.

11
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.508
Love you!

12
00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:56.678
I'll finish up and we'll go
get your brother, Lucas.

13
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.013
All right, let's get outta here.

14
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.111
Hey, Frank, we still got plenty to do
one more batch if you want.

15
00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:49.123
The fuck was that?

16
00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:51.292
Listen.

17
00:04:56.923 --> 00:04:59.967
You said they weren't gonna
reopen this place for another few weeks.

18
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.388
The fuck is that, Frank?

19
00:05:08.017 --> 00:05:09.852
That's gotta be an animal.

20
00:05:15.858 --> 00:05:17.151
Fuck me.

21
00:05:19.195 --> 00:05:20.988
- The fuck you going, Frank?
- Come on.

22
00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:22.990
Fuck.

23
00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:35.878
The fuck is going on?

24
00:05:39.257 --> 00:05:40.591
Where you going?

25
00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:43.594
Frank.

26
00:05:46.556 --> 00:05:47.557
Fuck.

27
00:05:55.356 --> 00:05:57.525
Frank, let's get the fuck
outta here, all right?

28
00:05:57.608 --> 00:06:00.945
- Let's get the fuck outta here.
- Something's on fucking fire, man.

29
00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:04.198
Frank!

30
00:06:04.282 --> 00:06:06.325
Let's get the fuck outta here, buddy.

31
00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:07.785
Let's get the fuck outta here.

32
00:06:08.286 --> 00:06:09.495
This is fucked up, man.

33
00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:11.873
Where you going?

34
00:06:11.956 --> 00:06:13.499
Let's get the fuck outta here.

35
00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.085
Frank!

36
00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:17.920
Run, Frank, run!

37
00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:21.424
Oh, my God!

38
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.551
Kenny!

39
00:06:27.388 --> 00:06:28.556
Kenny!

40
00:06:55.207 --> 00:06:56.626
Daddy?

41
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.338
Daddy?

42
00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:37.833
I'll be right out.

43
00:07:55.685 --> 00:07:58.270
It's obviously
much more than just that.

44
00:07:58.854 --> 00:08:01.482
Would anyone like to help him elaborate?

45
00:08:03.776 --> 00:08:08.614
So, storytelling is a way
for people to explain their world...

46
00:08:08.698 --> 00:08:10.032
their culture...

47
00:08:10.116 --> 00:08:13.953
passing on customs and beliefs
from one generation to the next.

48
00:08:14.537 --> 00:08:17.915
In America, and especially
here in Oregon...

49
00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:21.252
storytelling started with
our indigenous people.

50
00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:25.047
Native Americans who were
teaching the younger people...

51
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:28.509
in their communities about
their culture and identities.

52
00:08:28.592 --> 00:08:33.556
Can anyone give me an example
of a fable or a myth?

53
00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:35.933
Or a fairy tale even.

54
00:08:37.268 --> 00:08:39.395
Brody, give it a shot.

55
00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:45.568
Evie, do you have any stories
you wanna share?

56
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.821
Lucas.

57
00:08:49.447 --> 00:08:51.282
Give me an example of, um...

58
00:08:52.324 --> 00:08:54.452
a fable or a myth.

59
00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:55.578
Come on.

60
00:08:58.205 --> 00:08:59.206
Anyone? Anyone?

61
00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:02.126
Okay. Go ahead, Jasmine.

62
00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:04.920
"Goldilocks."
"Goldilocks" is a fairy tale.

63
00:09:05.004 --> 00:09:06.088
That's very good.

64
00:09:06.172 --> 00:09:08.674
- What's the story of "Goldilocks"?
- Lucas.

65
00:09:08.758 --> 00:09:10.718
While a family
of bears are away...

66
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:14.221
Goldilocks enters their house
and eats their porridge.

67
00:09:14.305 --> 00:09:16.682
Then the bears come home
and get angry with her.

68
00:09:17.308 --> 00:09:18.726
That's right. Very good.

69
00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:21.854
So, is there a moral
or a lesson in that story?

70
00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:22.938
Yes.

71
00:09:23.022 --> 00:09:24.690
Don't eat bears' food
without permission.

72
00:09:24.774 --> 00:09:25.775
That's right.

73
00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:27.818
Don't take something that's not yours.

74
00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:29.528
Hey, everyone,

75
00:09:29.612 --> 00:09:31.739
be prepared to discuss
and write about...

76
00:09:31.822 --> 00:09:35.159
a fairy tale or a myth
when you come back.

77
00:10:03.104 --> 00:10:04.480
Guys, let's go.

78
00:11:57.468 --> 00:11:59.428
Here you go, ma'am.
Nice to see ya.

79
00:12:07.311 --> 00:12:09.104
That'll be $3.

80
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.151
Is that everything?

81
00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:23.452
That'll be $4.50, please.

82
00:12:25.287 --> 00:12:27.349

83
00:12:27.373 --> 00:12:29.124

Hey, sis.

90
00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:56.837
How was school?

91
00:13:58.213 --> 00:13:59.423
Uh...

92
00:14:00.007 --> 00:14:01.717
It's about the same.

93
00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:05.804
Just give it time. They'll warm to you.

94
00:14:05.888 --> 00:14:07.097
Mmm.

95
00:14:07.598 --> 00:14:10.517
I'm not sure it's about warming.

96
00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:16.607
It's just not...
what I hoped it would be.

97
00:14:24.448 --> 00:14:26.700
You want me to move that out of here?

98
00:14:31.997 --> 00:14:34.875
All right, I'm gonna try and
get some sleep. Good night.

99
00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.085
Good night.

100
00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:20.731
Boy.

101
00:16:29.573 --> 00:16:31.301
<i>Opioid epidemic persists</i>

102
00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:32.868

103
00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:45.839
The basket by the phone.

104
00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:55.140
Can you not move my stuff, please?

105
00:16:55.224 --> 00:16:58.560
I have it all where it is,
so I know where it is.

106
00:16:59.895 --> 00:17:01.647
Sorry. Yeah.

107
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:08.987
I was just trying to give us more space.

108
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.740
I'm gonna move out as soon as I can.

109
00:17:12.241 --> 00:17:14.743
Jules, I didn't say anything
about moving out.

110
00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:23.502
I'm sorry. I'm just getting
ready to go evict...

111
00:17:24.378 --> 00:17:26.547
another family with kids.

112
00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:29.800
Give 'em 10, 15 minutes...

113
00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.177
to grab what they can carry,
throw it in their car...

114
00:17:32.261 --> 00:17:34.638
if they have a car, and then...

115
00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:37.933
I wish you wouldn't have run, Paul.

116
00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:39.142
You didn't have to.

117
00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:43.772
There weren't exactly too many people...
banging down the doors for the position

118
00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:46.066
after Warren Stokes retired.

119
00:17:50.946 --> 00:17:52.948
I barely recognize this place anymore.

120
00:17:54.992 --> 00:17:58.370
Yeah, well, a lot
can change in 20 years.

121
00:18:01.999 --> 00:18:05.502
It's our own little
slice of paradise here.

122
00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:17.639
<i>Who's next?</i>

123
00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:21.393
Lucas.

124
00:18:22.144 --> 00:18:23.729
You wanna read us your story?

125
00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:25.480
- He can't read, Ms. Meadows.
- Clint.

126
00:18:25.564 --> 00:18:26.940
Yes, he can.

127
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.652
I know you've been
working on a story.

128
00:18:31.153 --> 00:18:33.071
Will you read us a little bit?

129
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.254
Once, there were three bears...

130
00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:53.592
that lived in a dark and wet cave...

131
00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.510
up above a small town.

132
00:18:56.053 --> 00:18:59.431
Big Bear, Little Bear, and Baby Bear.

133
00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:05.979
Big Bear used to take care
of the little bears.

134
00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:08.690
But Big Bear got sick.

135
00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:12.569
Lost his job.

136
00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.364
And his insides turned black.

137
00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:23.080
One day, Little Bear came home...

138
00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:26.541
and Big Bear and Baby Bear
were different.

139
00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:31.004
Big Bear's sickness had gotten worse.

140
00:19:31.088 --> 00:19:36.051
Big Bear has become
more angrier and meaner...

141
00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.514
because they had no food.

142
00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:42.265
No meat.

143
00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:48.939
It's very good, Lucas.

144
00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:53.026
But they had each other.

145
00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:12.379
You know
he belongs there, right?

146
00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:13.630
Mmm-hmm.

147
00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:18.385
Oh, my God! Is that dog shit?

148
00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:21.179
God, dude. That smells like ass. God.

149
00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:25.308
What kind of a person
would put that in there?

150
00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:30.522
You motherfucker! You think
this is funny? Eat it!

151
00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:34.401
Fight! Fight! Fight!

152
00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:35.485
- Clint!
- Eat it!

153
00:20:35.569 --> 00:20:36.570
Hey! Clint, stop!

154
00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:38.071
Does that hurt?

155
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.701
Okay.

156
00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.538
Okay, you put your shirt back on.

157
00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:53.545
I'll be right out.

158
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:05.802
Hey. I was
just about to go in there.

159
00:23:05.886 --> 00:23:07.012
You wanna join me?

160
00:23:09.973 --> 00:23:11.474
That's not why I invited you in.

161
00:23:11.558 --> 00:23:15.896
I invited you in to have ice cream...
because I wanted to know

162
00:23:15.979 --> 00:23:18.899
if ice cream is your favorite vegetable.

163
00:23:19.983 --> 00:23:21.401
Because it's mine.

164
00:23:22.277 --> 00:23:23.987
Ice cream isn't a vegetable.

165
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.238
Yeah, it is.

166
00:23:25.322 --> 00:23:26.781
It's a dessert.

167
00:23:26.865 --> 00:23:29.242
To most people, yeah. But to me?

168
00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:31.536
Totally a vegetable.

169
00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:37.542
So, if ice cream is a vegetable,

170
00:23:37.626 --> 00:23:39.294
what's your favorite fruit?

171
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:42.964
Come on.

172
00:23:44.007 --> 00:23:45.175
Donuts?

173
00:23:45.258 --> 00:23:48.386
Mine too. Chocolate, obviously.

174
00:23:49.137 --> 00:23:51.306
I also like cheeseburgers as a fruit.

175
00:23:56.353 --> 00:23:58.772
What about your brother?
Does he like ice cream?

176
00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:02.359
How do you know I have a brother?

177
00:24:03.652 --> 00:24:05.528
Teachers know everything.

178
00:24:08.156 --> 00:24:09.699
So where is he?

179
00:24:10.533 --> 00:24:11.618
At home.

180
00:24:12.243 --> 00:24:13.495
With your mom?

181
00:24:14.412 --> 00:24:18.750
If you knew everything, then
you would know my mom's dead.

182
00:24:20.627 --> 00:24:22.253
I'm sorry to hear that.

183
00:24:23.505 --> 00:24:25.674
But that's something we have in common.

184
00:24:26.174 --> 00:24:27.509
My mom died too.

185
00:24:29.427 --> 00:24:30.637
Really?

186
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.181
When I was 12.

187
00:24:34.182 --> 00:24:35.475
I'm 12.

188
00:24:36.017 --> 00:24:37.060
I know.

189
00:24:38.979 --> 00:24:41.106
So tell me about your brother.
What's his name?

190
00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:46.236
- Aiden.
- Hmm.

191
00:24:47.696 --> 00:24:49.114
How old's Aiden?

192
00:24:51.157 --> 00:24:52.534
Seven.

193
00:24:52.617 --> 00:24:55.537
Oh, so he's... Is he in our school?

194
00:24:56.579 --> 00:24:58.039
Not anymore.

195
00:25:03.086 --> 00:25:04.879
He's always with my dad.

196
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:06.631
Hmm.

197
00:25:07.132 --> 00:25:09.092
Does your dad teach him at home?

198
00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:11.636
What's your dad do?

199
00:25:14.723 --> 00:25:16.057
I gotta go.

200
00:25:20.395 --> 00:25:22.230
And don't follow me this time.

201
00:26:05.982 --> 00:26:07.776
Move! Shoo.

202
00:28:19.866 --> 00:28:20.950
Hello?

203
00:29:05.578 --> 00:29:08.248
- What... What?
- Jesus! Jesus!

204
00:29:08.331 --> 00:29:10.625
I thought you heard me.

205
00:29:11.125 --> 00:29:12.252
No.

206
00:29:13.211 --> 00:29:14.837
The fuck is this?

207
00:29:16.839 --> 00:29:19.592
Is that the kind of thing
you taught in California?

208
00:29:22.887 --> 00:29:25.014
'Cause I don't think
that's gonna fly here.

209
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.106
Paul.

210
00:29:37.402 --> 00:29:40.780
You have every right to resent me.

211
00:29:47.036 --> 00:29:48.663
I don't blame you for that.

212
00:29:50.456 --> 00:29:53.459
I know you couldn't have
understood then...

213
00:29:53.543 --> 00:29:56.170
but I couldn't stay
in this house anymore.

214
00:29:57.714 --> 00:30:01.301
Just know that I have spent my life...

215
00:30:02.969 --> 00:30:05.221
trying to deal with leaving you.

216
00:30:07.015 --> 00:30:11.394
And resolve my issues.

217
00:30:12.603 --> 00:30:14.480
And it has not been easy.

218
00:30:15.898 --> 00:30:20.778
Yeah, and I've spent my entire life
praying you'd come back.

219
00:31:45.863 --> 00:31:47.949
Go!

220
00:32:10.012 --> 00:32:11.013
Here.

221
00:32:11.889 --> 00:32:13.516
I got this for you.

222
00:32:24.694 --> 00:32:27.071
I'll come back after
he's eaten. He'll be tired.

223
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:51.489
<i>Daddy, no.</i>

224
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:57.161
<i>No. Daddy.</i>

225
00:33:58.538 --> 00:34:00.790
<i>Please. You're hurting me.</i>

226
00:34:01.666 --> 00:34:04.210
Hey, Jules. What? What?

227
00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.213
- Jesus!
- Sorry.

228
00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:09.799
You okay?

229
00:34:10.967 --> 00:34:13.010
- Jesus.
- Sorry.

230
00:34:14.262 --> 00:34:15.388
I was just...

231
00:34:16.222 --> 00:34:19.934
I wanted to clear the air and talk.

232
00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:23.896
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

233
00:34:28.401 --> 00:34:30.111
Well, no. I'm...

234
00:34:31.862 --> 00:34:33.489
So many...

235
00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:43.291
Hey... do you know Frank Weaver?

236
00:34:43.916 --> 00:34:45.001
Of course.

237
00:34:45.668 --> 00:34:46.669
I've cited him...

238
00:34:46.752 --> 00:34:51.716
and revived him with Narcan
more times than I can count.

239
00:34:52.383 --> 00:34:53.426
Why?

240
00:34:53.509 --> 00:34:56.429
His son, uh, is a student of mine.

241
00:34:57.972 --> 00:34:58.973
That was his drawing.

242
00:34:59.724 --> 00:35:01.475
I pulled it from the trash.

243
00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:02.810
That makes sense, yeah.

244
00:35:02.893 --> 00:35:04.562
Every time I see him...

245
00:35:04.645 --> 00:35:08.274
I expect to find Frank dead
with a needle in his arm.

246
00:35:08.357 --> 00:35:10.735
So why isn't he in jail?

247
00:35:10.818 --> 00:35:13.279
I don't know. I've tried many times...

248
00:35:13.362 --> 00:35:18.075
but he goes away,
who takes care of the boys?

249
00:35:18.576 --> 00:35:20.119
After their mother died...

250
00:35:20.202 --> 00:35:25.791
Protective Services felt he was somehow
fit enough to be their guardian.

251
00:35:25.875 --> 00:35:29.795
And what can I say to that?

252
00:35:29.879 --> 00:35:31.964
Something is going on there.

253
00:35:32.048 --> 00:35:34.550
First of all, it looks like
no one even lives there.

254
00:35:34.634 --> 00:35:36.510
And when I got close...

255
00:35:38.179 --> 00:35:39.597
You went to his house?

256
00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.934
I thought I heard something
that did not sound normal.

257
00:35:44.018 --> 00:35:45.186
You can't do that.

258
00:35:45.269 --> 00:35:46.979
You can't go to Frank Weaver's house...

259
00:35:47.063 --> 00:35:48.624
- without telling me.
- I heard something,

260
00:35:48.648 --> 00:35:49.899
and it was not normal.

261
00:35:51.067 --> 00:35:52.547
Do you understand? You can't do that.

262
00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:54.463
Everyone thinks these problems are just
gonna go away...

263
00:35:54.487 --> 00:35:56.113
and we know that they don't.

264
00:36:06.499 --> 00:36:07.625
Lucas?

265
00:36:10.336 --> 00:36:13.964
Lucas... I'm hungry.

266
00:38:16.003 --> 00:38:18.297
- Where did you get this?
- His desk.

267
00:38:23.385 --> 00:38:25.304
It's textbook, Ellen.

268
00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:27.223
Emotional, physical...

269
00:38:27.306 --> 00:38:28.516
Hold on.

270
00:38:29.266 --> 00:38:32.812
Neither of us are experts
in diagnosing abuse, but I hear you.

271
00:38:33.687 --> 00:38:36.690
This is very disturbing.

272
00:38:38.901 --> 00:38:42.279
But sadly, Lucas is not the only one
not getting the attention he needs.

273
00:38:42.363 --> 00:38:44.698
But he's here. In a safe space.

274
00:38:44.782 --> 00:38:46.325
What is that supposed to mean?

275
00:38:46.408 --> 00:38:48.536
His younger brother,
why isn't he enrolled?

276
00:38:49.119 --> 00:38:51.872
We've had plenty of students
that are homeschooled.

277
00:38:51.956 --> 00:38:54.792
And they're kept out so they can
move product for their parents.

278
00:38:54.875 --> 00:38:56.627
Or so we don't smell methamphetamine

279
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:58.921
on their clothes,
and turn their parents in.

280
00:39:00.631 --> 00:39:04.426
Okay, but regardless,
that is a cry for help.

281
00:39:05.803 --> 00:39:08.556
Take it from someone
who can diagnose abuse.

282
00:39:19.608 --> 00:39:22.862
I tell you what, next chance I get,
I will reach out to his father.

283
00:39:26.156 --> 00:39:27.157
<i>Here you go.</i>

284
00:39:32.705 --> 00:39:33.998
What can I do for ya?

285
00:39:39.545 --> 00:39:40.588
Sorry.

286
00:39:41.881 --> 00:39:42.882
Hey.

287
00:39:48.929 --> 00:39:50.806
I don't know, Paul.
It was just...

288
00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:53.309
The bottom half was all chewed to hell.

289
00:39:53.392 --> 00:39:55.185
Damnedest thing I ever saw.

290
00:39:56.896 --> 00:39:58.230
All right, well...

291
00:39:59.189 --> 00:40:01.817
We'll go take a look. Thank you, Warren.

292
00:40:02.359 --> 00:40:03.611
Thanks, Sheriff.

293
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.619
What's going on?

294
00:40:12.286 --> 00:40:16.999
He, uh, found a part of a man
in the woods today.

295
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.169
Part of a man?

296
00:40:21.587 --> 00:40:22.963
Who is that?

297
00:40:23.631 --> 00:40:25.841
You don't remember Sheriff Stokes?

298
00:40:25.925 --> 00:40:28.010
- When we were kids?
- Yeah, I do.

299
00:40:29.595 --> 00:40:33.307
Yeah, he said he was, uh,
hiking up near Greymouth...

300
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:38.729
when a stench led him...
to a man half buried in the woods.

301
00:40:40.439 --> 00:40:44.902
I guess the other half
was found in the mine, near a meth lab.

302
00:40:45.903 --> 00:40:50.115
It was probably
a bear or a cougar, something.

303
00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:51.659
Jesus.

304
00:40:51.742 --> 00:40:53.661
Well, from what he just told me...

305
00:40:53.744 --> 00:40:57.790
I don't think Jesus was
anywhere to be found.

306
00:40:59.667 --> 00:41:02.086
All right. We gotta get out
there and meet the coroner.

307
00:41:02.586 --> 00:41:03.587
Hmm.

308
00:41:04.129 --> 00:41:05.255
See you later.

309
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.801
Ready?

310
00:41:36.662 --> 00:41:38.455
- Hi.
- Hi.

311
00:41:39.164 --> 00:41:40.332
Are you okay?

312
00:41:44.003 --> 00:41:45.713
Is God really dead?

313
00:41:46.797 --> 00:41:47.840
What?

314
00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.384
Daddy said God is dead.

315
00:42:00.352 --> 00:42:02.688
Just remember what Mama told us.

316
00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:08.235
Me and you... we was born
under the lucky star.

317
00:42:14.116 --> 00:42:16.577
Here. I brought you these.

318
00:43:00.245 --> 00:43:03.540
Determining cause
was virtually impossible.

319
00:43:04.374 --> 00:43:08.462
This has got to be
an animal, right?

320
00:43:09.213 --> 00:43:11.590
No animal that I've ever seen.

321
00:43:12.382 --> 00:43:16.261
What's more troubling
are the teeth marks...

322
00:43:16.845 --> 00:43:18.555
on the radial bone.

323
00:43:19.389 --> 00:43:21.141
They seem human.

324
00:43:24.812 --> 00:43:28.148
I don't quite know
what to tell you, Paul.

325
00:43:29.066 --> 00:43:31.110
I'm sorry.

326
00:45:37.152 --> 00:45:38.712
<i>She false with Cassio!</i>

327
00:45:38.779 --> 00:45:40.072
<i>Did you say with Cassio?</i>

328
00:45:40.155 --> 00:45:42.133
<i>With Cassio, mistress.
Go to, charm your tongue.</i>

329
00:45:42.157 --> 00:45:45.494
<i>I will not charm my tongue,
I am bound to speak.</i>

330
00:45:45.577 --> 00:45:48.288
<i>My mistress here lies
murdered in her bed.</i>

331
00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.249
<i>Heavens forfend!</i>

332
00:45:52.251 --> 00:45:57.297
<i>Nay, stare not, masters,
it is true, indeed.</i>

333
00:45:59.633 --> 00:46:01.593
<i>Nay,
lay thee down and roar.</i>

334
00:46:01.677 --> 00:46:04.096
<i>For thou hast killed
the sweetest innocent</i>

335
00:46:04.179 --> 00:46:05.597
<i>that e'er did lift up eye.</i>

336
00:46:05.681 --> 00:46:06.765
<i>Oh, she was foul!</i>

337
00:46:06.848 --> 00:46:08.558
<i>Iago knows that she with Cassio</i>

338
00:46:08.642 --> 00:46:10.811
<i>hath the act of shame...
a thousand times committed.</i>

339
00:46:10.894 --> 00:46:11.937
<i>Oh, heavens!</i>

340
00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.272
<i>Cassio confessed it.</i>

341
00:46:13.355 --> 00:46:16.149
<i>And she did gratify his amorous works
with that same handkerchief.</i>

342
00:46:16.233 --> 00:46:17.651
<i>- Handkerchief.
- Alas!</i>

343
00:46:17.734 --> 00:46:19.444
<i>'Twill out, 'twill out.</i>

344
00:46:19.528 --> 00:46:20.904
<i>- Hold your peace.
- I peace?</i>

345
00:46:20.988 --> 00:46:23.156
<i>No, I will speak
as liberal as the north.</i>

346
00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.241
<i>Be wise.</i>

347
00:46:24.324 --> 00:46:28.370
<i>Let heaven and men and devils...</i>

348
00:46:28.453 --> 00:46:30.038
<i>let them all, all, all...</i>

349
00:46:38.547 --> 00:46:39.673
Hello?

350
00:46:48.432 --> 00:46:51.518
Mr. Weaver,
it's Ellen Booth, from school.

351
00:47:07.159 --> 00:47:09.036
<i>Will you, I pray,</i>

352
00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:11.830
<i>demand that demi-devil.</i>

353
00:47:12.706 --> 00:47:15.709
<i>Why he hath thus ensnared
my soul and body?</i>

354
00:47:16.918 --> 00:47:18.253
<i>Demand me nothing.</i>

355
00:47:18.337 --> 00:47:20.714
<i>What you know, you know.</i>

356
00:47:23.717 --> 00:47:25.677
<i>Are there no stones in heaven...</i>

357
00:47:25.761 --> 00:47:28.013
<i>but what serve for the thunder?</i>

358
00:48:12.933 --> 00:48:14.559
Mr. Weaver!

359
00:48:40.544 --> 00:48:43.088
Oh!

360
00:49:07.237 --> 00:49:08.655
Hello?

361
00:49:29.426 --> 00:49:30.719
Oh, my God.

362
00:49:31.845 --> 00:49:33.930
You must be starving.

363
00:49:34.723 --> 00:49:36.308
What has he done to you?

364
00:51:20.203 --> 00:51:21.496
<i>Here's where we found</i>

365
00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.582
<i>the other half of Kenny Glass,
right here.</i>

366
00:51:26.293 --> 00:51:27.627
What are these?

367
00:51:27.711 --> 00:51:31.006
Medicine bags. Wards, for defense.

368
00:51:32.591 --> 00:51:34.676
But why would these be hanging in here?

369
00:51:48.648 --> 00:51:49.983
What about this?

370
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:55.113
Is that from a buck?

371
00:51:55.196 --> 00:51:56.531
Nope.

372
00:51:56.615 --> 00:51:59.117
Nothing like anything I've seen before.

373
00:52:01.578 --> 00:52:03.079
How far back does this go?

374
00:52:03.163 --> 00:52:05.749
Far. But I wouldn't go any further.

375
00:52:08.918 --> 00:52:10.170
Go for Paul.

376
00:52:14.466 --> 00:52:15.717
Say again.

377
00:52:20.138 --> 00:52:21.514
10-9.

378
00:52:24.392 --> 00:52:25.810
<i>missing person.</i>

379
00:52:25.894 --> 00:52:26.895
Shit.

380
00:52:28.855 --> 00:52:30.315
All right. Let's go.

381
00:53:08.728 --> 00:53:11.064
Headed to your house
full of drugged-out freaks?

382
00:53:12.482 --> 00:53:15.527
Teacher can't step in to save
your ass out here, faggot.

383
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:18.613
- I said I was sorry.
- I don't take apologies from pussies.

384
00:53:20.365 --> 00:53:23.702
Hey! Don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

385
00:53:35.839 --> 00:53:36.965
Lucas!

386
00:54:52.624 --> 00:54:55.126
<i>When was the last time
you heard from Ellen?</i>

387
00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:56.795
Ellen Booth?

388
00:54:58.296 --> 00:55:00.924
Yesterday. Why?

389
00:55:02.509 --> 00:55:05.053
<i>Her husband called in
a missing person's report.</i>

390
00:55:05.136 --> 00:55:07.055
<i>Said she hadn't returned his calls...</i>

391
00:55:07.138 --> 00:55:09.682
<i>or been home all day.</i>

392
00:55:09.766 --> 00:55:10.767
<i>Really?</i>

393
00:55:13.144 --> 00:55:15.021
What are you doing about it?

394
00:55:15.104 --> 00:55:16.648
<i>Filed a report.</i>

395
00:55:16.731 --> 00:55:19.192
<i>Issued an APB, searched the hospitals...</i>

396
00:55:19.275 --> 00:55:24.364
<i>but aside from that, just hope
it's all a misunderstanding.</i>

397
00:55:27.617 --> 00:55:30.078
I asked her to talk to Frank Weaver.

398
00:55:30.161 --> 00:55:31.496
About Lucas.

399
00:55:39.921 --> 00:55:41.172
You smell that?

400
00:55:41.256 --> 00:55:42.257
Yeah.

401
00:55:51.182 --> 00:55:52.934
Frank, it's Sheriff Meadows.

402
00:55:56.896 --> 00:55:59.148
Fucking place smells like death.

403
00:56:01.818 --> 00:56:03.611
Yeah, there's something wrong here.

404
00:56:08.783 --> 00:56:09.868
Frank!

405
00:56:15.373 --> 00:56:17.709
Let's get outta here.
We'll get a warrant tomorrow.

406
00:56:42.817 --> 00:56:44.986
<i>small town of
Cispus Falls, Oregon.</i>

407
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:47.363
<i>Rumors of another round
of gruesome attacks...</i>

408
00:56:47.447 --> 00:56:51.451
<i>processing evidence
and provide forensic expertise.</i>

409
00:56:51.534 --> 00:56:53.578
<i>Our attempts to contact
local law enforcement</i>

410
00:56:53.661 --> 00:56:54.662
<i>have gone unanswered...</i>

411
00:56:54.746 --> 00:56:57.624
Have you spoken with
Clint's parents this morning?

412
00:56:57.707 --> 00:57:01.544
Yes. They wanted to know if he
had been in school yesterday.

413
00:57:01.628 --> 00:57:04.088
And he was here till
the end of the day, right?

414
00:57:09.469 --> 00:57:11.804
Look, I know this has...

415
00:57:12.889 --> 00:57:15.725
been difficult on all of us.

416
00:57:16.726 --> 00:57:19.562
But right now, we have to work
under the assumption...

417
00:57:19.646 --> 00:57:23.441
that this is just some
kind of a coincidence.

418
00:57:23.524 --> 00:57:24.567
We'll find him.

419
00:57:25.735 --> 00:57:26.945
We'll find him.

420
00:57:32.325 --> 00:57:33.534
Excuse me.

421
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:39.290
- What?
- A coincidence?

422
00:57:39.374 --> 00:57:41.167
That my student is now missing, too?

423
00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:42.502
What the fuck, Paul?

424
00:57:42.585 --> 00:57:45.296
What else would you
like me to do, Jules? Hmm?

425
00:57:45.797 --> 00:57:49.258
The warrant is being processed
right now. It takes time.

426
00:57:49.342 --> 00:57:51.195
- It doesn't just happen overnight.
- This is all related.

427
00:57:51.219 --> 00:57:54.179
- What would you like me to fucking do?
- You cannot tell me that it isn't.

428
00:58:48.317 --> 00:58:50.153
God almighty.

429
00:59:01.289 --> 00:59:03.416
These Frank Weaver's footprints?

430
00:59:04.125 --> 00:59:05.334
Some.

431
00:59:06.127 --> 00:59:08.212
There's also a child's.

432
00:59:20.266 --> 00:59:22.185
What the fuck is this?

433
00:59:25.605 --> 00:59:26.814
Jesus Christ.

434
00:59:29.358 --> 00:59:30.568
It's charred.

435
00:59:32.153 --> 00:59:33.321
It's burnt.

436
00:59:33.905 --> 00:59:35.573
And flayed.

437
00:59:37.742 --> 00:59:39.243
It's gotta be Frank Weaver.

438
00:59:40.161 --> 00:59:43.164
Yeah, the teeth will tell us.

439
00:59:43.748 --> 00:59:46.125
Looks like something
just burst out of him.

440
00:59:55.259 --> 00:59:58.054
Lucas. Lucas, listen to me.
Listen, I don't want you to go in there.

441
00:59:58.137 --> 01:00:01.099
- No. No. Let me go!
- Listen, I know. It's okay.

442
01:00:01.182 --> 01:00:02.266
What's going on here?

443
01:00:24.664 --> 01:00:27.083
Well, needless to say, I'm concerned.

444
01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:30.044
He's severely dehydrated, suffers from
chronic malnourishment.

445
01:00:30.128 --> 01:00:33.506
I recommend keeping him
overnight, possibly longer...

446
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:37.301
but I don't have to tell you
that he is a deeply damaged boy.

447
01:00:37.385 --> 01:00:40.680
Could be the circumstances
or his genetic disposition...

448
01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:44.851
but there are definite signs
of a psychiatric crisis here.

449
01:00:44.934 --> 01:00:48.271
Anti-anxiety, anti-psychotics
will be our friend...

450
01:00:48.354 --> 01:00:50.898
but given what he's just experienced...

451
01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:53.860
When do you think
I'll be able to interview him?

452
01:00:53.943 --> 01:00:56.362
Well, not tonight, certainly.

453
01:00:57.864 --> 01:00:59.448
What do you plan on doing with him?

454
01:00:59.532 --> 01:01:02.118
Well, we're discussing that. Um...

455
01:01:04.787 --> 01:01:06.289
But it's complicated.

456
01:01:06.372 --> 01:01:07.915
Oh, I'm sure.

457
01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:11.210
The little fella's
got a long road ahead of him.

458
01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:14.130
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention...

459
01:01:14.213 --> 01:01:18.426
but it's clear that he has
been subjected to abuse.

460
01:01:19.302 --> 01:01:20.887
And for some time.

461
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.140
Thank you, Alan.

462
01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:35.359
We can't. No.

463
01:01:35.443 --> 01:01:37.111
He has no one.

464
01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:40.656
We don't know where the brother is.

465
01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:43.826
So where's he gonna go?

466
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:47.330
I have no idea right now, but
he is not your responsibility.

467
01:01:47.413 --> 01:01:49.665
He doesn't have a family.

468
01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:52.960
And he's my student.
So he is my responsibility.

469
01:01:53.878 --> 01:01:54.962
Jules...

470
01:01:56.214 --> 01:01:58.507
This is not about you.

471
01:01:58.591 --> 01:02:00.968
This is about him,
and getting him the help...

472
01:02:01.052 --> 01:02:02.595
What did you just say to me?

473
01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:05.139
What did you just say to me?

474
01:02:07.975 --> 01:02:11.187
Don't put our past on him.

475
01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:13.189
Oh, I'm sorry.

476
01:02:13.689 --> 01:02:15.900
Did he snap your arm in two?

477
01:02:17.068 --> 01:02:19.487
Did he force you to hide under
the floor of that kitchen...

478
01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:22.049
- praying he would never come home?
- You have no idea what he...

479
01:02:22.073 --> 01:02:23.592
Did you have to meet
his every fucking need?

480
01:02:23.616 --> 01:02:25.284
Because I don't remember that.

481
01:02:27.745 --> 01:02:30.373
You have no idea what he did to me.

482
01:03:06.409 --> 01:03:07.660
Let us in!

483
01:03:08.244 --> 01:03:09.912
<i>Daddy!</i>

484
01:03:09.996 --> 01:03:11.831
Daddy!

485
01:03:11.914 --> 01:03:14.083
- Dad, please!
- Open the door, Daddy!

486
01:03:15.293 --> 01:03:17.378
Guys, you have to give me a second.

487
01:03:17.962 --> 01:03:19.505
Daddy's just sick.

488
01:03:23.009 --> 01:03:25.261
Daddy! Daddy, please!

489
01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:28.723
Daddy, what's happening to you?

490
01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:30.349
- Open the door!
- No!

491
01:03:30.433 --> 01:03:32.810
Daddy!

492
01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:43.404
Look at me. Daddy is very, very sick.

493
01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:45.781
You lock that fucking door.

494
01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:48.784
No matter what I do,
you don't open that door.

495
01:03:48.868 --> 01:03:49.994
You hear me?

496
01:03:53.122 --> 01:03:54.123
Lock it!

497
01:03:54.206 --> 01:03:55.833
<i>Lock the door!</i>

498
01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:58.669
<i>Daddy, Aiden's very sick.</i>

499
01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:43.881
If you wouldn't mind,
just telling me what you make of these.

500
01:04:48.803 --> 01:04:50.054
Hmm.

501
01:05:00.231 --> 01:05:01.649
Where did you find this?

502
01:05:03.067 --> 01:05:04.652
Belongs to a student.

503
01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:08.406
Is the student Native?

504
01:05:09.615 --> 01:05:10.825
No.

505
01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:12.034
How can that be?

506
01:05:12.743 --> 01:05:14.870
I don't know. He isn't.

507
01:05:24.797 --> 01:05:26.507
This is what was in the mine.

508
01:05:31.554 --> 01:05:35.141
This... is what was in the mine.

509
01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:40.396
It's the wendigo.

510
01:05:41.063 --> 01:05:42.398
Translates to...

511
01:05:43.107 --> 01:05:47.361
a diabolical wickedness
that devours mankind.

512
01:05:47.445 --> 01:05:49.947
According to legend, during
a brutally cold winter...

513
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:53.451
a lost hunter's severe hunger
drove him to cannibalism.

514
01:05:54.118 --> 01:05:55.953
And after feasting on human flesh...

515
01:05:56.036 --> 01:05:58.330
he became crazed...

516
01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:04.628
and transformed into an amorphous spirit
that could take many forms.

517
01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.549
And roamed the forest for fresh victims.

518
01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.511
His insatiable appetite
was never satisfied.

519
01:06:14.263 --> 01:06:15.848
Excuse me.

520
01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:18.809
This is a myth you're talking about.

521
01:06:18.893 --> 01:06:20.227
For you, yeah.

522
01:06:20.936 --> 01:06:22.771
But a cautionary tale

523
01:06:22.855 --> 01:06:24.607
to the indigenous people
who believe in it.

524
01:06:26.901 --> 01:06:28.027
They're elusive.

525
01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:32.239
And known to be eternally starving,
but feasting only makes them hungrier.

526
01:06:32.907 --> 01:06:34.074
And weaker.

527
01:06:34.158 --> 01:06:37.077
Those who are unfortunate
enough to encounter one...

528
01:06:37.161 --> 01:06:41.207
can only kill it when it's
in its weakened state.

529
01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:45.002
And only by extinguishing
its beating heart...

530
01:06:45.836 --> 01:06:49.215
forcing it to search for another host.

531
01:06:51.008 --> 01:06:52.468
But it all makes sense, you see.

532
01:06:52.551 --> 01:06:55.513
I mean, our ancestral spirits
never died.

533
01:06:55.596 --> 01:06:57.473
They were here long before we were...

534
01:06:57.556 --> 01:06:59.892
and they'll be here
long after we are gone.

535
01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.230
But now, they're angry.

536
01:07:18.077 --> 01:07:19.161
<i>Paul.</i>

537
01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:21.956
Go for Paul.

538
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:25.543
<i>Pumphouse Road.
You gotta come by the tracks.</i>

539
01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:31.507
What? What happened?

540
01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:33.801
<i>We got a body out here.</i>

541
01:07:35.344 --> 01:07:38.347
<i>It's bad, Paul. It's real bad.</i>

542
01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:56.365
ID?

543
01:07:56.448 --> 01:07:58.325
Yeah. It's Clint Owens.

544
01:08:01.912 --> 01:08:03.831
I don't know where to start, Paul.

545
01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:06.834
Let me see it.

546
01:08:13.215 --> 01:08:15.259
Tell me this was a train, Jake.

547
01:08:18.345 --> 01:08:20.514
<i>That boy was eaten in half.</i>

548
01:08:20.598 --> 01:08:24.143
- The fuck is going on here?
- I don't know, Dan.

549
01:08:25.811 --> 01:08:27.021
We've...

550
01:08:29.356 --> 01:08:31.400
Let's get back to the station...

551
01:08:31.483 --> 01:08:34.820
and we'll figure it out.
I'll call the mayor...

552
01:08:35.446 --> 01:08:38.324
and we'll get out in front of it.

553
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:49.084
I'm sorry. I'm not inclined
to believe anybody...

554
01:08:49.168 --> 01:08:54.173
about some mythological nature beast.

555
01:08:54.882 --> 01:08:58.969
Things like that don't exist, Jules.
Regardless of what Stokes said.

556
01:08:59.053 --> 01:09:04.183
There's a logical, reasonable
explanation for this.

557
01:09:05.768 --> 01:09:07.311
So Ellen Booth...

558
01:09:08.354 --> 01:09:13.150
and that... husk that you
pulled out of the Weavers'.

559
01:09:14.735 --> 01:09:18.072
And what about Lucas's
brother, where is he?

560
01:09:22.326 --> 01:09:23.869
I don't know.

561
01:09:26.497 --> 01:09:28.540
Take me to the hospital.

562
01:10:15.003 --> 01:10:16.588
I'm outside your house.

563
01:10:17.339 --> 01:10:18.465
<i>Good.</i>

564
01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:20.801
<i>I'm wrapping up with
the mayor, then headed over.</i>

565
01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:22.386
<i>Just take a look around.</i>

566
01:10:45.576 --> 01:10:47.536
Can I get you anything else?

567
01:10:48.871 --> 01:10:50.038
No, thank you.

568
01:11:02.468 --> 01:11:07.681
<i>Lucas, do you remember
when we were talking about our moms?</i>

569
01:11:08.223 --> 01:11:10.184
And how they died?

570
01:11:13.061 --> 01:11:15.063
Well, what I didn't tell you...

571
01:11:15.147 --> 01:11:18.525
was that my dad died, too.

572
01:11:23.155 --> 01:11:24.656
How did he die?

573
01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:30.746
Well, he kind of did it to himself.

574
01:11:31.538 --> 01:11:33.624
When did he die?

575
01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:36.293
Not too long ago.

576
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.587
Were you here when he died?

577
01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:41.048
No.

578
01:11:43.008 --> 01:11:44.051
Why?

579
01:11:45.052 --> 01:11:46.887
Didn't you love your father?

580
01:11:53.268 --> 01:11:58.106
Well, I moved back here
to be with my brother.

581
01:11:59.358 --> 01:12:01.693
We actually, we grew up in this house.

582
01:12:03.403 --> 01:12:04.863
And I missed him.

583
01:12:26.718 --> 01:12:30.889
Lucas, did they tell you
at the hospital?

584
01:12:32.724 --> 01:12:33.934
Tell me what?

585
01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:38.814
Your dad died.

586
01:12:42.693 --> 01:12:44.027
He's not dead.

587
01:12:45.821 --> 01:12:47.739
Yeah, he is, Lucas.

588
01:12:49.825 --> 01:12:51.285
My brother, Paul...

589
01:12:52.411 --> 01:12:54.371
he found him in your house.

590
01:12:55.873 --> 01:12:58.709
No. That was my old dad.

591
01:12:59.334 --> 01:13:01.753
The one who was sick and mean.

592
01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:07.009
My new dad is with Aiden,
but Aiden doesn't understand.

593
01:13:07.551 --> 01:13:08.594
And he needs me.

594
01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:12.264
I just have to feed him,
and he'll love me.

595
01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:15.851
What?

596
01:13:44.171 --> 01:13:46.256
See? I told you.

597
01:13:51.053 --> 01:13:55.140
He'll come for me, and take me
to the mine to be with Aiden.

598
01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:05.859
He's here.

599
01:14:16.286 --> 01:14:17.454
Hey, Paul?

600
01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:22.084
Yeah, Dan, what is it?

601
01:14:23.627 --> 01:14:25.128
<i>There's something here.</i>

602
01:14:26.672 --> 01:14:28.840
I think it's in the shed.

603
01:14:49.236 --> 01:14:50.821
Come on. Let's go.

604
01:15:01.999 --> 01:15:03.709
Where are you taking me?

605
01:15:14.261 --> 01:15:16.013
- I wanna see my brother.
- Shh!

606
01:15:48.336 --> 01:15:49.463
<i>Dan?</i>

607
01:15:54.134 --> 01:15:55.969
<i>Dan, do you read me?</i>

608
01:16:00.891 --> 01:16:02.976
There's a little kid in here.

609
01:16:04.061 --> 01:16:05.312
<i>What, Lucas?</i>

610
01:16:09.691 --> 01:16:11.109
<i>Lucas is at the house.</i>

611
01:16:12.819 --> 01:16:14.946
<i>Dan!</i>

612
01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:19.159
Dan, come in!

613
01:16:25.373 --> 01:16:26.458
Oh, shit.

614
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.376
They all have locks.

615
01:16:54.069 --> 01:16:55.487
Goddamn it.

616
01:16:57.614 --> 01:16:58.698
Fuck.

617
01:17:01.118 --> 01:17:02.202
Paul.

618
01:17:07.874 --> 01:17:11.002
Lucas, stay. Don't move.

619
01:17:31.648 --> 01:17:33.024
Paul, no.

620
01:17:35.527 --> 01:17:36.778
No. Lucas!

621
01:18:09.644 --> 01:18:10.854
Dan.

622
01:18:14.941 --> 01:18:16.318
It's okay.

623
01:19:55.166 --> 01:19:56.167
Paul?

624
01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.211
Paul?

625
01:20:10.098 --> 01:20:11.099
Lucas?

626
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:37.751
Paul?

627
01:20:41.046 --> 01:20:42.130
Oh, my God!

628
01:20:43.465 --> 01:20:46.176
Paul! Oh, my God. Paul!

629
01:20:49.137 --> 01:20:50.430
Oh, God.

630
01:21:06.404 --> 01:21:08.782
Paul...

631
01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:12.369
Paul, I have to move you. Paul.

632
01:21:16.498 --> 01:21:17.791
I'm gonna move you.

633
01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:18.958
To where?

634
01:21:20.668 --> 01:21:21.961
Come on.

635
01:21:24.506 --> 01:21:25.840
Is Lucas dead?

636
01:21:25.924 --> 01:21:27.675
Be still. Be still.

637
01:21:28.843 --> 01:21:31.346
He went to the mine.
I'm gonna go after him.

638
01:21:31.429 --> 01:21:34.057
- What?
- He thinks that's where Aiden is.

639
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.142
No, you can't do that. You can't...

640
01:21:37.185 --> 01:21:39.104
I have to. I have to go find him.

641
01:21:39.187 --> 01:21:40.397
Not by yourself.

642
01:21:41.773 --> 01:21:43.316
You need a doctor.

643
01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:44.442
I'm coming with you.

644
01:21:46.194 --> 01:21:47.404
Get my gun.

645
01:21:49.864 --> 01:21:51.908
You're not leaving me.

646
01:22:16.558 --> 01:22:18.017
This is Julia Meadows.

647
01:22:18.893 --> 01:22:20.770
Paul and I are at Greymouth Mine.

648
01:22:20.854 --> 01:22:22.480
He needs an ambulance.

649
01:23:06.232 --> 01:23:07.358
Lucas?

650
01:23:47.315 --> 01:23:48.691
Lucas?

651
01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:00.430
Ugh!

652
01:25:28.082 --> 01:25:30.251
Lucas? Lucas.

653
01:25:31.753 --> 01:25:33.171
He's...

654
01:25:35.882 --> 01:25:36.883
What?

655
01:25:36.966 --> 01:25:38.301
Go back.

656
01:25:38.384 --> 01:25:39.427
Go.

657
01:29:07.969 --> 01:29:09.428
Ow!

658
01:30:34.305 --> 01:30:36.098
He's gonna be okay.

659
01:30:36.182 --> 01:30:37.767
He's just sick.

660
01:30:41.729 --> 01:30:43.147
Lucas, listen to me.

661
01:30:45.274 --> 01:30:47.735
He is never gonna get better.

662
01:30:48.653 --> 01:30:49.862
Yes, he is.

663
01:30:49.946 --> 01:30:51.197
Lucas, he's not.

664
01:30:52.531 --> 01:30:53.950
It's too late for him.

665
01:30:54.033 --> 01:30:55.284
He's sick...

666
01:30:55.368 --> 01:30:57.703
but he'll be better, I promise.

667
01:31:01.832 --> 01:31:03.417
Lucas, listen to me.

668
01:31:03.501 --> 01:31:05.878
You know he's not gonna get any better.

669
01:31:07.046 --> 01:31:09.548
I need to know that you understand.

670
01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:27.400
Look away. Look away, Lucas!

671
01:31:29.276 --> 01:31:30.486
It's okay.

672
01:31:47.712 --> 01:31:49.422
I'm so sorry.

673
01:32:44.477 --> 01:32:46.479
What are we gonna do with him?

674
01:32:48.981 --> 01:32:51.442
Keep him. For now.

675
01:32:53.611 --> 01:32:54.987
We have no choice.

676
01:32:58.199 --> 01:33:00.701
It's like living with a tiger cub.

677
01:33:00.785 --> 01:33:05.331
You know what he's going to grow into.

678
01:33:09.877 --> 01:33:12.546
Do you think you could kill
something you love?

679
01:33:30.731 --> 01:33:32.024
There.

680
01:33:32.108 --> 01:33:33.192
Come on, let's go.

681
01:33:36.862 --> 01:33:39.323
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'll catch up to you.
