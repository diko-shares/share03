1
00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:26.196
Sure do love you.

2
00:12:28.032 --> 00:12:29.824
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mrs. MacNeil.

3
00:12:29.992 --> 00:12:31.910
- How are you today?
- Fine, thank you.

4
00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:33.370
That's good.

5
00:12:33.537 --> 00:12:36.289
It's okay, I've got it. Thanks.

6
00:12:36.457 --> 00:12:39.000
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning, Karl.

7
00:12:39.168 --> 00:12:43.088
Oh, Karl, we've got rats in the attic.
You'd better get some traps.

8
00:12:43.255 --> 00:12:46.591
- Rats?
- I'm afraid so.

9
00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:48.051
But the attic is clean.

10
00:12:48.219 --> 00:12:49.970
All right, then, we've got clean rats.

11
00:12:50.138 --> 00:12:53.432
- No, no. No rats.
- I just heard them, Karl.

12
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.850
Maybe plumbing.

13
00:12:55.018 --> 00:12:58.187
Yeah, or maybe rats.
Now, will you just get the traps?

14
00:12:58.355 --> 00:12:59.605
Yes, I go now.

15
00:12:59.773 --> 00:13:01.649
Don't go now.
The stores aren't open yet.

16
00:13:01.817 --> 00:13:03.567
- I'll go see.
- They're closed!

17
00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:06.201
<i>In the group over here...</i>

18
00:13:06.363 --> 00:13:08.614
<i>...I need a priest, a nun
and two students.</i>

19
00:13:10.158 --> 00:13:13.119
<i>That's what we want.
That's exactly what we want.</i>

20
00:13:16.623 --> 00:13:18.624
Burke. Oh, Burke.

21
00:13:18.792 --> 00:13:20.626
- Is this scene really essential?
- Chris.

22
00:13:20.794 --> 00:13:22.586
Just consider if we can do without it.

23
00:13:22.754 --> 00:13:25.589
Take a look at this damn thing.
It just doesn't make sense.

24
00:13:25.757 --> 00:13:29.635
It's plain. You're a teacher of the college.
You don't want the building torn down.

25
00:13:29.803 --> 00:13:33.056
- Come on. I can read, for Christ's sake.
- Well, what's wrong?

26
00:13:33.224 --> 00:13:35.475
Well, why are they tearing
the building down?

27
00:13:35.643 --> 00:13:38.645
Shall we summon the writer?
He's in Paris, I believe.

28
00:13:38.813 --> 00:13:39.980
- Hiding?
- Fucking.

29
00:13:43.401 --> 00:13:45.652
Scene 39: Hotel. Take four.

30
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.655
<i>All right. Hustle, background. And action.</i>

31
00:13:48.823 --> 00:13:50.423
<i>Hasn't there been enough killing?</i>

32
00:13:52.034 --> 00:13:53.535
<i>Is this your campus?</i>

33
00:13:55.163 --> 00:13:57.998
<i>Get the Defense Department
off this campus!</i>

34
00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:01.835
<i>It's our school!</i>

35
00:14:02.003 --> 00:14:04.004
<i>- You have no rights!</i>
- Hypocrite!

36
00:14:04.172 --> 00:14:06.131
<i>Military complex, man!</i>

37
00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:08.049
<i>And action, Chris.</i>

38
00:14:08.217 --> 00:14:10.260
<i>I've seen enough killing in my lifetime!</i>

39
00:14:12.014 --> 00:14:13.931
<i>There's no need for it!</i>

40
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.312
<i>That's right! That's right!</i>

41
00:14:20.439 --> 00:14:23.357
<i>We're all concerned with human rights,
for God's sake...</i>

42
00:14:23.525 --> 00:14:26.360
<i>...but the kids who want
to get an education have a right too!</i>

43
00:14:31.909 --> 00:14:35.703
<i>Don't you understand? It's against
your own principle, for God's sake!</i>

44
00:14:38.373 --> 00:14:41.542
<i>You can't accomplish anything by
shutting kids off from their...</i>

45
00:14:46.423 --> 00:14:49.967
<i>- if you want... Hold it, hold it!</i>
- Quiet!

46
00:14:50.135 --> 00:14:53.555
<i>If you want to effect any change,
you have to do it within the system.</i>

47
00:14:56.434 --> 00:14:59.144
<i>Okay, cut. That's a wrap.</i>

48
00:15:15.912 --> 00:15:17.371
- I'll walk home tonight.
- Okay.

49
00:15:17.539 --> 00:15:19.998
Here, take that
and drop it at my house, yeah?

50
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.000
- Good night, Tom.
- Good night.

51
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.500
There's not a day in my life
that I don't feel like a fraud.

52
00:16:02.668 --> 00:16:04.988
I mean, priests, doctors, lawyers.
I've talked to them all.

53
00:16:06.422 --> 00:16:08.022
I don't know anyone who hasn't
felt that.

54
00:16:14.138 --> 00:16:15.306
Hello?

55
00:16:15.473 --> 00:16:16.891
In here.

56
00:16:18.643 --> 00:16:20.769
- Hi. How did your day go?
- Oh, not too bad.

57
00:16:20.937 --> 00:16:24.231
It was like the, uh, Walt Disney version
of the Ho Chi Minh story.

58
00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:25.649
Other than that, terrific.

59
00:16:25.817 --> 00:16:28.444
- What we got, anything exciting?
- Here.

60
00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:31.155
- Oh, all right.
- And also, you got an invitation.

61
00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:33.866
- What's this?
- Dinner at the White House.

62
00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:36.285
You're kidding.
Is it a big party or something?

63
00:16:36.453 --> 00:16:37.745
I think it's five or six people.

64
00:16:37.913 --> 00:16:40.748
Oh. Thursday, huh? All right.

65
00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:41.957
Hi, Mom.

66
00:16:42.125 --> 00:16:43.959
What'd you do today?

67
00:16:44.127 --> 00:16:45.794
- Stuff.
- What's that mean, stuff?

68
00:16:45.962 --> 00:16:49.798
Well, uh, me and Sharon played a game
in the backyard.

69
00:16:49.966 --> 00:16:52.301
- You did.
- And we had a picnic down by the river.

70
00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:54.303
That sounds good.

71
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:55.512
You should have seen.

72
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.683
This man came along on this
beautiful gray horse.

73
00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.560
- Really? What kind?
- Wasn't he pretty?

74
00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:02.812
Was it a mare, a gelding, what?

75
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.023
- I think it was a gelding.
- Mm-hm.

76
00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.817
It was gray. Oh, it was so beautiful.

77
00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:10.236
The guy let me ride it all around
and everything.

78
00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:12.405
- You're kidding.
- She rode for half an hour.

79
00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:17.494
It was so nice. Oh, I loved it.
Oh, Mom, can't we get a horse?

80
00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:21.039
- Not while we're in Washington, honey.
- Why not, Mom? Ha, ha.

81
00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.041
We'll see when we get home, okay?

82
00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.835
- When could I have one?
- We'll see, Regan. We'll see.

83
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:29.214
Hey, listen, on the party invitations,
I wanted to write a personal...

84
00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:32.133
- Regan, don't! Regan, come back here!
- Ha-ha-ha.

85
00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.225
- All right, give it up. Give it up!
- No!

86
00:17:39.393 --> 00:17:41.352
- Ooh!
- Ha-ha-ha.

87
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.145
- You'll be sorry! Come on.
- No!

88
00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.428
Father?

89
00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:18.055
Could you help an old altar boy?

90
00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:19.266
I'm a Catholic.

91
00:18:42.373 --> 00:18:44.458
All right, come on, man.

92
00:18:45.126 --> 00:18:46.886
- What, are you crazy?
- Go ahead.

93
00:19:45.939 --> 00:19:53.939
Mama?

94
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:05.874
Dimmy! Dimmy!

95
00:20:09.671 --> 00:20:11.213
Oh, how are you, Mama?

96
00:20:11.381 --> 00:20:13.549
- I'm so glad to see you.
- You look good.

97
00:20:13.716 --> 00:20:15.425
I'm all right.

98
00:20:15.593 --> 00:20:18.053
- How's your leg?
- How about you? You are all right?

99
00:20:18.221 --> 00:20:19.555
I'm fine, Mama. I'm fine.

100
00:20:24.687 --> 00:20:27.814
Your Uncle John passed by to visit me.

101
00:20:27.982 --> 00:20:30.316
- Oh, really? When?
- Last month.

102
00:20:34.905 --> 00:20:37.240
- Too tight?
- No.

103
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.328
You have to stay off it. You can't go up and
down the stairs. You have to give it a rest.

104
00:20:42.496 --> 00:20:43.913
Okay.

105
00:20:54.216 --> 00:20:57.844
I could take you somewhere where
you'd be safe. You wouldn't be alone.

106
00:20:58.012 --> 00:21:01.806
There would be people around. You wouldn't
be sitting here listening to a radio.

107
00:21:06.521 --> 00:21:07.813
You understand me?

108
00:21:07.981 --> 00:21:12.693
This is my house
and I'm not going no place.

109
00:21:25.665 --> 00:21:27.791
Dimmy, you worry for something?

110
00:21:27.959 --> 00:21:29.960
- No, Mama.
- You are not happy?

111
00:21:30.128 --> 00:21:31.879
Tell me, what is the matter?

112
00:21:32.047 --> 00:21:35.216
Mama, I'm all right. I'm fine.
Really, I am.

113
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.919
Here it comes.

114
00:22:11.087 --> 00:22:12.420
There.

115
00:22:15.591 --> 00:22:17.031
- Oh, look at that.
- Do you like it?

116
00:22:17.093 --> 00:22:19.844
Aw, isn't that funny? Ha, ha.

117
00:22:20.471 --> 00:22:23.682
I better put him over here to dry, though.
He's still wet.

118
00:22:23.849 --> 00:22:26.142
Oh, here we go.

119
00:22:26.895 --> 00:22:28.854
There, he can dry there.

120
00:22:29.022 --> 00:22:31.190
Hey, where'd this come from?

121
00:22:32.359 --> 00:22:34.777
- I found it.
- Where?

122
00:22:36.238 --> 00:22:37.530
Closet.

123
00:22:38.699 --> 00:22:40.074
Huh.

124
00:22:40.284 --> 00:22:41.867
You been playing with it?

125
00:22:42.035 --> 00:22:44.036
- Yup.
- Do you know how?

126
00:22:44.204 --> 00:22:46.038
I'll show you.

127
00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:51.711
Wait a minute. You need two.

128
00:22:51.878 --> 00:22:55.172
No, you don't. I do it all the time.

129
00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.550
Oh, yeah? Well, let's both play with it.

130
00:23:00.012 --> 00:23:01.887
You really don't want me to play, huh?

131
00:23:02.055 --> 00:23:05.266
No, I do. Captain Howdy said no.

132
00:23:05.434 --> 00:23:08.395
- Captain who?
- Captain Howdy.

133
00:23:08.563 --> 00:23:10.063
Who's Captain Howdy?

134
00:23:10.231 --> 00:23:13.942
You know. I make the questions
and he does the answers.

135
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.779
- Oh, Captain Howdy. Yeah, I see.
- He's nice.

136
00:23:17.947 --> 00:23:19.906
Oh, I'll bet he is.

137
00:23:20.074 --> 00:23:22.909
- Here, I'll show you.
- All right.

138
00:23:23.077 --> 00:23:27.080
Captain Howdy,
do you think my mom's pretty?

139
00:23:29.042 --> 00:23:31.043
Captain Howdy?

140
00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:33.295
Captain Howdy, that isn't very nice.

141
00:23:33.463 --> 00:23:35.964
- Well, maybe he's sleeping.
- You think?

142
00:23:38.009 --> 00:23:40.844
Regan, why are you reading that stuff?

143
00:23:41.012 --> 00:23:42.262
Because I like it.

144
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.182
It's not even a good picture of you.
Look at that.

145
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.934
- You look so mature.
- I wouldn't talk.

146
00:23:48.102 --> 00:23:51.105
You wouldn't talk?
Well, I didn't know they were taking it.

147
00:23:51.273 --> 00:23:53.274
I didn't have my makeup man there.

148
00:23:53.609 --> 00:23:56.110
Let me take an eyelash off your face.

149
00:23:56.278 --> 00:23:58.446
Okay. No, I didn't get it.

150
00:23:58.781 --> 00:24:00.865
- Mm.
- What are we gonna do on your birthday?

151
00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:03.910
Isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?

152
00:24:04.078 --> 00:24:06.204
No work? What can we do?

153
00:24:06.372 --> 00:24:07.413
I don't know.

154
00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:08.861
Well, what would you like to do?

155
00:24:08.999 --> 00:24:10.917
- Got any ideas?
- Mm-mm.

156
00:24:11.085 --> 00:24:12.752
Hmm?

157
00:24:13.045 --> 00:24:15.755
Let me think. Let me think.
What can we do?

158
00:24:15.923 --> 00:24:18.633
Hey, we never finished seeing
all the sights in Washington.

159
00:24:18.801 --> 00:24:21.135
Didn't get to Lee Mansion
and lots of stuff.

160
00:24:21.303 --> 00:24:24.806
Shall we do that? Go sightseeing?
If it's a nice day?

161
00:24:24.973 --> 00:24:27.100
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.

162
00:24:27.518 --> 00:24:32.689
And tomorrow night,
I'll take you to a movie. Okay?

163
00:24:32.857 --> 00:24:34.775
Oh, I love you.

164
00:24:34.943 --> 00:24:37.486
I love you, Rags.

165
00:24:40.073 --> 00:24:41.198
We'll have a good day, yeah?

166
00:24:41.658 --> 00:24:44.284
You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like.

167
00:24:44.452 --> 00:24:46.078
Mr. Dennings?

168
00:24:46.246 --> 00:24:48.330
Well, you know, it's okay.

169
00:24:48.498 --> 00:24:49.790
Well, thank you very much...

170
00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:52.960
...but why on earth would I wanna bring
Burke on your birthday?

171
00:24:53.128 --> 00:24:54.670
Well, you like him.

172
00:24:54.838 --> 00:24:58.799
Yeah, I like him. Don't you like him?
Hey, what's going on? What is this?

173
00:24:58.967 --> 00:25:02.469
- You're gonna marry him, aren't you?
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

174
00:25:02.637 --> 00:25:04.304
- What?
- Me marry Burke Dennings?

175
00:25:04.472 --> 00:25:06.598
Don't be silly. Of course not.

176
00:25:06.766 --> 00:25:08.684
Where did you ever get an idea like that?

177
00:25:08.852 --> 00:25:10.853
But you like him.

178
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.858
Of course I like him. I like pizzas too,
but I'm not gonna marry one.

179
00:25:15.025 --> 00:25:17.277
You don't like him like Daddy?

180
00:25:18.446 --> 00:25:20.697
Regan, I love your daddy.

181
00:25:20.865 --> 00:25:23.116
I'll always love your daddy, honey.

182
00:25:23.534 --> 00:25:26.870
Okay? Burke just comes
around here a lot, because...

183
00:25:28.497 --> 00:25:30.707
...well, he's lonely.
He don't got nothing to do.

184
00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:33.960
Well, I heard differently.

185
00:25:34.128 --> 00:25:36.463
Oh, you did? What did you hear, huh?

186
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.382
- I don't know. I just thought.
- Come on. What did you hear?

187
00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.217
Well, you didn't think so good.

188
00:25:41.385 --> 00:25:43.595
- How do you know? Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

189
00:25:43.762 --> 00:25:46.431
Because Burke and I are just friends.
Okay? Really.

190
00:25:46.599 --> 00:25:47.724
Okay.

191
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.143
You ready for sleep?

192
00:25:52.271 --> 00:25:54.982
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

193
00:26:15.587 --> 00:26:17.630
It's my mother, Tom.

194
00:26:18.089 --> 00:26:20.799
She's alone. I never should have left her.

195
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.262
At least in New York, I'd be near her.
I'd be close to her.

196
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.098
I could see about a transfer, Damien.

197
00:26:29.809 --> 00:26:34.523
I need reassignment, Tom. I want out of
this job. It's wrong, it's no good.

198
00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.775
You're the best we've got.

199
00:26:37.652 --> 00:26:39.653
Am I really?

200
00:26:41.989 --> 00:26:44.282
It's more than psychiatry,
and you know that, Tom.

201
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.244
Some of their problems come down
to faith...

202
00:26:47.411 --> 00:26:50.956
...their vocation, the meaning of their
lives, and I can't cut it anymore.

203
00:26:56.128 --> 00:26:58.505
I need out. I'm unfit.

204
00:27:02.593 --> 00:27:04.636
Think I've lost my faith, Tom.

205
00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.140
Hello?

206
00:27:09.308 --> 00:27:11.810
Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil.

207
00:27:12.019 --> 00:27:13.937
Operator, you have got to be kidding!

208
00:27:14.105 --> 00:27:17.066
I have been on this line for 20 minutes!

209
00:27:17.234 --> 00:27:19.527
Jesus Christ. Can you believe this?

210
00:27:19.695 --> 00:27:22.488
He doesn't even call his daughter
on her birthday.

211
00:27:22.656 --> 00:27:24.949
- Maybe the circuit is busy.
- Oh, circuits, my ass!

212
00:27:25.117 --> 00:27:26.492
He doesn't give a shit.

213
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.121
- Why don't you let me...?
- No, I've got it, Sharon. It's all right.

214
00:27:30.289 --> 00:27:33.249
Yes. No, operator,
don't tell me there's no answer.

215
00:27:33.417 --> 00:27:35.209
It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome.

216
00:27:35.419 --> 00:27:38.004
Would you try it again, please,
and let it ring?

217
00:27:38.171 --> 00:27:40.172
Hello? Yes.

218
00:27:41.174 --> 00:27:45.052
No, operator,
I've given you the number four times.

219
00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.598
Do you take an illiteracy test to get
that job, for Christ's sakes?

220
00:27:48.765 --> 00:27:51.142
Don't tell me to be calm, goddamn it!

221
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.322
Yeah?

222
00:28:05.325 --> 00:28:06.617
You're kidding me.

223
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.997
Okay. I thought I just went to bed.

224
00:28:13.333 --> 00:28:14.666
Yeah.

225
00:28:14.834 --> 00:28:17.586
Hey, what are we doing, scene 61?

226
00:28:17.795 --> 00:28:21.757
Okay. Oh, just remind Flo about
that blue belt, huh?

227
00:28:21.924 --> 00:28:23.884
All right. Yeah, I'll see you.

228
00:28:37.023 --> 00:28:38.941
What are you doing here?

229
00:28:39.109 --> 00:28:41.486
My bed was shaking.

230
00:28:41.654 --> 00:28:43.696
I can't get to sleep.

231
00:28:43.864 --> 00:28:45.907
Oh, honey.

232
00:30:06.657 --> 00:30:08.450
Goddamn it.

233
00:30:12.121 --> 00:30:13.580
Jesus.

234
00:30:52.704 --> 00:30:53.746
There's nothing.

235
00:30:53.914 --> 00:30:55.998
Oh, Karl.

236
00:30:56.166 --> 00:30:59.335
Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that.

237
00:30:59.503 --> 00:31:01.962
Very sorry, but you see, no rats.

238
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.840
No rats. Thanks a lot. That's terrific.

239
00:32:11.743 --> 00:32:14.203
Oh, my God.

240
00:32:31.763 --> 00:32:35.308
Okay. Unroll your fist.

241
00:32:36.143 --> 00:32:37.310
Arm up.

242
00:32:37.477 --> 00:32:40.229
Very good. That wasn't so bad, was it?

243
00:32:40.397 --> 00:32:43.399
Remain perfectly still. Breathe normally.

244
00:32:56.956 --> 00:32:59.333
Tell me if you feel a vibration.

245
00:33:01.252 --> 00:33:02.294
Regan?

246
00:33:07.175 --> 00:33:08.508
You feel anything?

247
00:33:09.594 --> 00:33:11.511
Can you feel this?

248
00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:13.639
I don't feel anything.

249
00:33:19.979 --> 00:33:21.647
Put this in your mouth.

250
00:33:21.814 --> 00:33:24.191
Keep it there.
This tells your temperature.

251
00:33:24.359 --> 00:33:27.737
When the red light goes on,
that's your temperature.

252
00:33:28.614 --> 00:33:30.156
I don't want it.

253
00:34:05.192 --> 00:34:06.734
A disorder of the nerves.

254
00:34:06.902 --> 00:34:08.362
At least we think it is.

255
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:10.447
We don't know yet exactly how it works.

256
00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:13.075
It's often seen in early adolescence.

257
00:34:13.243 --> 00:34:14.702
She shows all the symptoms.

258
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:16.745
Hyperactivity.

259
00:34:16.997 --> 00:34:18.497
Her temper.

260
00:34:19.416 --> 00:34:20.916
Performance in math.

261
00:34:21.084 --> 00:34:23.335
Yeah. Why the math? What is that?

262
00:34:23.503 --> 00:34:25.587
It affects her concentration.

263
00:34:25.755 --> 00:34:27.423
Ah-ha.

264
00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:31.301
- Now, this is for Ritalin.
- Okay.

265
00:34:31.886 --> 00:34:33.721
Ten milligrams a day.

266
00:34:33.888 --> 00:34:35.472
Is that a tranquilizer?

267
00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.807
It's a stimulant.

268
00:34:36.975 --> 00:34:39.601
A stimulant? My God,
she's higher than a kite now.

269
00:34:40.228 --> 00:34:42.563
Her condition isn't quite what it seems.

270
00:34:42.731 --> 00:34:45.607
Nobody knows the cause of hyperkinetic
behavior in a child.

271
00:34:45.775 --> 00:34:48.235
The Ritalin seems to work
to relieve the condition.

272
00:34:48.403 --> 00:34:50.780
And as to how or why,
we really don't know.

273
00:34:51.407 --> 00:34:55.285
But, uh, her symptoms could be
overreaction to depression.

274
00:34:55.453 --> 00:34:57.120
That's out of my field.

275
00:34:57.747 --> 00:34:59.873
My daughter isn't depressed.

276
00:35:00.041 --> 00:35:04.961
Well, you mentioned her father
and the separation.

277
00:35:05.713 --> 00:35:07.797
You think I should take her
to a psychiatrist?

278
00:35:07.965 --> 00:35:11.384
No. I think we should wait
and see what happens with the Ritalin.

279
00:35:11.552 --> 00:35:13.636
I think that's the answer.

280
00:35:13.971 --> 00:35:16.431
- Okay.
- Let's wait two, three weeks.

281
00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:20.018
All right. And the lies she's been telling?
That's part of it, huh?

282
00:35:20.186 --> 00:35:23.605
- Lies?
- Like saying her bed's shaking. That stuff.

283
00:35:25.274 --> 00:35:28.026
Have you ever known your daughter
to swear?

284
00:35:28.194 --> 00:35:30.988
- To use obscenities?
- No, never.

285
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.158
Hmm. Interesting.

286
00:35:34.576 --> 00:35:39.080
Similar... Similar to
things like her lying...

287
00:35:39.247 --> 00:35:43.167
- ...it's uncharacteristic for her.
- I don't understand. She doesn't swear.

288
00:35:44.169 --> 00:35:47.630
Well, she let loose quite a string
while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.

289
00:35:48.799 --> 00:35:52.009
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?

290
00:35:53.845 --> 00:35:56.680
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.

291
00:35:56.848 --> 00:35:59.016
Well, give me an example. Like what?

292
00:35:59.184 --> 00:36:01.393
Specifically, what did she say?

293
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:03.354
Specifically, Mrs. MacNeil...

294
00:36:04.523 --> 00:36:07.691
...she advised me to keep my fingers
away from her...

295
00:36:08.777 --> 00:36:10.694
...goddamn cunt.

296
00:36:15.034 --> 00:36:17.494
I can't believe it.

297
00:36:20.957 --> 00:36:23.375
- She...
- You don't think a psychiatrist...?

298
00:36:23.543 --> 00:36:27.379
No. I think the best explanation
is always the simplest.

299
00:36:27.547 --> 00:36:31.133
- Well, we'll wait. We'll wait and see.
- Yeah.

300
00:36:32.176 --> 00:36:34.553
So in the meantime...

301
00:36:34.887 --> 00:36:36.304
...try not to worry.

302
00:36:37.473 --> 00:36:39.057
How?

303
00:36:41.144 --> 00:36:43.478
The edema affected her brain,
you understand?

304
00:36:43.646 --> 00:36:45.522
She don't let no doctor come near her.

305
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.108
She was all the time screaming,
talking to the radio.

306
00:36:48.276 --> 00:36:50.861
- You should've called me when it happened.
- Listen.

307
00:36:51.028 --> 00:36:53.030
Regular hospital not gonna
put up with that.

308
00:36:53.198 --> 00:36:55.116
We give her a shot and bring her here...

309
00:36:55.284 --> 00:36:58.161
...until the doctors fix up her leg,
then we take her right out.

310
00:36:58.328 --> 00:37:00.746
Two or three months and she's out,
good as new.

311
00:37:07.087 --> 00:37:08.671
- Miss?
- Yes?

312
00:37:08.839 --> 00:37:10.089
We want to see Mrs. Karras.

313
00:37:10.257 --> 00:37:11.799
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes.

314
00:37:11.967 --> 00:37:15.011
- Are you a relative?
- Yes, I am her brother. He is her son.

315
00:37:15.179 --> 00:37:16.888
Just a minute.

316
00:37:39.454 --> 00:37:40.996
You know, it's funny.

317
00:37:41.164 --> 00:37:44.291
If you wasn't a priest, you'd be famous
psychiatrist on Park Avenue.

318
00:37:44.459 --> 00:37:47.920
Your mother, she'd be living in a penthouse
instead of there.

319
00:37:52.258 --> 00:37:56.011
You go in, Dimmy.
I'll wait for you outside.

320
00:37:57.764 --> 00:38:01.600
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the last bed
on the left-hand side.

321
00:38:03.519 --> 00:38:05.103
No, no. No, no.

322
00:38:05.271 --> 00:38:08.690
Go get someone else.
Don't bother the father.

323
00:38:08.858 --> 00:38:10.525
Go to your bed. Go to your bed.

324
00:38:12.237 --> 00:38:13.487
No, no. No, no.

325
00:38:13.655 --> 00:38:17.242
The father will be back to see you.
It's all right.

326
00:38:28.003 --> 00:38:29.170
Mama.

327
00:38:29.338 --> 00:38:30.922
It's Dimmy, Mama.

328
00:38:35.094 --> 00:38:36.511
Dimmy.

329
00:38:36.679 --> 00:38:39.264
Why you did this to me, Dimmy?

330
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:41.057
Why?

331
00:38:44.103 --> 00:38:46.354
Come on,
I'm gonna take you out of here, Mama.

332
00:38:46.522 --> 00:38:49.042
I'm gonna take you home.
I'll get you out of here tonight, Mama.

333
00:38:51.193 --> 00:38:54.612
Mama, everything's gonna be all right.
Mama, I'm gonna take you home.

334
00:38:54.905 --> 00:38:57.783
Mama, I'm gonna take you home.

335
00:38:59.035 --> 00:39:02.955
- Couldn't you have put her someplace else?
- Like what? Private hospital?

336
00:39:03.123 --> 00:39:06.500
Who got the money for that, Dimmy?
You?

337
00:39:37.449 --> 00:39:41.244
There seems to be an alien pubic hair
in my drink.

338
00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:46.750
- I beg your pardon?
- Never seen it before in my life. Have you?

339
00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:53.965
We're pretty comfortable up there compared
to the Gemini and Mercury programs.

340
00:39:54.133 --> 00:39:55.342
They were tight for space.

341
00:39:55.509 --> 00:39:58.762
You see, we got about 210 cubic feet,
so we can move around.

342
00:39:58.929 --> 00:40:01.056
If you ever go up there again,
will you take me along?

343
00:40:01.223 --> 00:40:03.266
Ha-ha-ha. What for?

344
00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:04.726
First missionary on Mars.

345
00:40:04.894 --> 00:40:10.190
Tell me, was it public relations you did
for the Gestapo or community relations?

346
00:40:10.358 --> 00:40:12.942
- I'm Swiss.
- Yes, of course.

347
00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:17.238
And you never went bowling with Goebbels,
either, I suppose, eh?

348
00:40:17.782 --> 00:40:19.617
Nazi bastard.

349
00:40:19.785 --> 00:40:21.994
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?

350
00:40:22.162 --> 00:40:24.580
- It's a red brick wing.
- Saint Mike's.

351
00:40:24.748 --> 00:40:27.708
What goes on there?
Who's the priest I keep seeing there?

352
00:40:27.876 --> 00:40:31.670
He's there all the time. He has black hair.
He's very intense looking. Who's that?

353
00:40:31.838 --> 00:40:32.963
- Damien Karras.
- Karras?

354
00:40:33.131 --> 00:40:38.386
That's his office, back of Saint Mike's.
He's our... Our psychiatric counselor.

355
00:40:39.471 --> 00:40:42.973
He had a pretty rough knock last night,
poor guy. His mother passed away.

356
00:40:43.141 --> 00:40:45.518
She was living by herself...

357
00:40:45.685 --> 00:40:49.438
...and I guess she was dead
a couple of days before they found her.

358
00:40:51.108 --> 00:40:53.275
Cunting Hun.

359
00:40:53.443 --> 00:40:57.321
Bloody, damned, butchering Nazi pig.

360
00:40:58.698 --> 00:41:00.742
Stop it! I'll kill you!

361
00:41:11.462 --> 00:41:13.004
What's the matter with you?

362
00:41:13.172 --> 00:41:14.840
What's for dessert?

363
00:41:22.682 --> 00:41:24.516
You sleeping?

364
00:41:33.067 --> 00:41:34.234
You get some sleep.

365
00:41:37.113 --> 00:41:42.034
Okay. Very good. All right.

366
00:41:42.202 --> 00:41:46.664
Listen, Burke, your car's at the curb.
Louie's waiting. It's nice and warm.

367
00:41:55.007 --> 00:41:56.966
Yes, honey. What?

368
00:41:58.302 --> 00:41:59.427
Fuck it.

369
00:42:06.059 --> 00:42:09.854
- I've never seen him acting up.
- Really. Blind is what he was.

370
00:42:18.405 --> 00:42:21.407
- Hi, Chris. This is a great party.
- Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.

371
00:42:21.575 --> 00:42:25.746
I don't need any encouragement. My idea
of heaven is a solid white nightclub...

372
00:42:25.914 --> 00:42:29.917
...with me as a headliner for all eternity,
and they love me.

373
00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.254
<i>Down on the east side</i>

374
00:42:34.422 --> 00:42:36.548
<i>Of Thoity-Thoid and Thoid</i>

375
00:42:36.716 --> 00:42:42.596
<i>That's my home sweet home</i>

376
00:42:43.097 --> 00:42:48.644
<i>Some people think
It's the home of black eyes</i>

377
00:42:48.811 --> 00:42:50.646
<i>Just because...</i>

378
00:42:50.813 --> 00:42:53.106
Hey, I think we've got a guest.

379
00:42:55.568 --> 00:42:56.944
You're gonna die up there.

380
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.287
Regan?

381
00:43:06.455 --> 00:43:08.206
Oh, my God, honey.

382
00:43:08.457 --> 00:43:10.333
Honey, what's the matter?

383
00:43:10.501 --> 00:43:11.918
- Sorry, she's sick.
- It's okay.

384
00:43:12.086 --> 00:43:15.213
She didn't know what she was saying.
Come upstairs. Come on.

385
00:43:24.139 --> 00:43:25.974
What made you say that, Regan?

386
00:43:28.519 --> 00:43:30.353
Do you know, sweetheart?

387
00:43:35.609 --> 00:43:37.151
Mother?

388
00:43:37.861 --> 00:43:39.487
What's wrong with me?

389
00:43:46.621 --> 00:43:51.834
It's just like the doctor said.
It's nerves, and that's all. Okay?

390
00:43:52.002 --> 00:43:54.837
You just take your pills
and you'll be fine. Really.

391
00:43:55.297 --> 00:43:56.547
Okay?

392
00:44:21.865 --> 00:44:23.574
Is it coming out, Willi?

393
00:44:23.742 --> 00:44:26.368
- Yes, I think so.
- Good.

394
00:44:29.206 --> 00:44:31.958
Mother! Mother!

395
00:44:32.126 --> 00:44:35.128
Mother! Mother!

396
00:44:36.505 --> 00:44:39.215
Mother! Mother!

397
00:44:39.383 --> 00:44:42.927
- Oh, my God!
- Make it stop!

398
00:44:49.143 --> 00:44:51.436
- I'm gonna fold.
- Big flop.

399
00:44:51.604 --> 00:44:55.482
Another five for the pair. There's
the ten with two and three of clubs.

400
00:44:55.733 --> 00:44:58.943
And a six. Pair of threes still best.

401
00:45:00.738 --> 00:45:04.699
- I'll talk to you about it tomorrow.
- Yeah!

402
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.955
Yeah.

403
00:45:12.417 --> 00:45:15.017
Hey, if you get a chance,
can you take a look at it for me?

404
00:45:16.088 --> 00:45:18.328
Where'd you get the money
for the Chivas Regal...

405
00:45:18.465 --> 00:45:19.715
- ...the poor box?
- Ha.

406
00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:22.635
That's an insult. I got a vow of poverty.

407
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:27.139
Where'd you get it, then?

408
00:45:27.307 --> 00:45:28.766
I stole it.

409
00:45:31.103 --> 00:45:32.436
I believe you.

410
00:45:32.604 --> 00:45:36.232
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.

411
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.276
I figure I saved him from
a big temptation.

412
00:45:41.113 --> 00:45:42.697
Oh, Christ!

413
00:45:42.864 --> 00:45:45.574
I should have been there. I wasn't there.
Should have been.

414
00:45:45.742 --> 00:45:47.243
There was nothing you could do.

415
00:45:47.953 --> 00:45:49.454
Lie down.

416
00:45:49.872 --> 00:45:52.416
Give me the butt. Come on.

417
00:45:55.002 --> 00:45:57.754
- Now you think you can sleep?
- Yeah.

418
00:45:57.922 --> 00:46:00.882
- Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
- No.

419
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.678
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.
Now, shut up and go to sleep.

420
00:46:16.149 --> 00:46:17.691
Good night.

421
00:46:23.865 --> 00:46:26.241
Stealing is a sin.

422
00:47:12.957 --> 00:47:14.291
I don't want it!

423
00:47:14.459 --> 00:47:17.044
- Regan, honey, it's to help you.
- I don't want it!

424
00:47:17.212 --> 00:47:19.505
- Hold still, honey.
- I don't want it!

425
00:47:20.548 --> 00:47:21.882
You fucking bastard!

426
00:47:23.301 --> 00:47:27.179
Remember also, O Lord,
thy servant, Mary Karras...

427
00:47:29.766 --> 00:47:35.145
...who has gone before us with the sign of
faith and sleeps the sleep of peace.

428
00:47:36.815 --> 00:47:40.609
Lord, I am not worthy to receive you.

429
00:47:40.777 --> 00:47:44.530
But only say the word
and I shall be healed.

430
00:47:46.366 --> 00:47:49.326
May the body of Christ bring me
to everlasting life.

431
00:48:02.883 --> 00:48:07.011
Well, it's a symptom...

432
00:48:08.722 --> 00:48:12.767
...of a type of disturbance in the
chemical-electrical activity of the brain.

433
00:48:12.935 --> 00:48:16.938
In your daughter's case, the temporal lobe,
up here in the lateral part of the brain.

434
00:48:17.106 --> 00:48:18.314
- Mm-hm.
- It's rare...

435
00:48:18.482 --> 00:48:20.608
...but it does cause bizarre
hallucinations...

436
00:48:20.776 --> 00:48:22.777
...and usually just before a convulsion.

437
00:48:22.945 --> 00:48:24.028
A convulsion?

438
00:48:24.196 --> 00:48:27.824
The shaking of the bed.
That's doubtless due to muscular spasms.

439
00:48:27.992 --> 00:48:31.244
Oh, no, no, that was no spasm.

440
00:48:31.412 --> 00:48:32.787
Look, I got on the bed.

441
00:48:32.955 --> 00:48:36.625
The whole bed was thumping
and rising off the floor...

442
00:48:36.793 --> 00:48:39.587
...and shaking, the whole thing,
with me on it.

443
00:48:39.754 --> 00:48:42.798
Mrs. MacNeil, the problem
with your daughter is not her bed.

444
00:48:42.966 --> 00:48:44.800
It's her brain.

445
00:48:50.974 --> 00:48:53.809
So, um, ahem. What causes this?

446
00:48:53.977 --> 00:48:56.145
Lesion. Lesion in the temporal lobe.

447
00:48:56.313 --> 00:48:58.272
It's a kind of seizure disorder.

448
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.776
Look, Doc, I really don't understand how
her whole personality could change.

449
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.654
- In the temporal lobe, it's very common.
- It is?

450
00:49:05.822 --> 00:49:09.199
It, uh, can last for days, even weeks.

451
00:49:09.784 --> 00:49:12.661
It isn't rare to find destructive...

452
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:14.830
...even criminal behavior.

453
00:49:16.375 --> 00:49:19.294
Hey, do me a favor, will you?
Tell me something good.

454
00:49:19.462 --> 00:49:23.715
Don't be alarmed. if it's a lesion,
in a way, she's fortunate.

455
00:49:23.883 --> 00:49:26.468
All we have to do is remove the scar.

456
00:49:41.067 --> 00:49:44.903
- Let's move her.
- Regan, can you sit up, scoot over?

457
00:49:50.701 --> 00:49:52.243
A little more.

458
00:49:52.828 --> 00:49:54.371
Good.

459
00:49:58.377 --> 00:50:01.253
Regan, I'm just gonna move you down
on the table, okay?

460
00:50:01.546 --> 00:50:03.214
Let me do this.

461
00:50:03.382 --> 00:50:05.216
It's okay.

462
00:50:06.218 --> 00:50:09.679
See? There we go.

463
00:50:13.517 --> 00:50:16.394
It's just for a short time.

464
00:50:28.532 --> 00:50:30.074
You're doing fine.

465
00:50:30.242 --> 00:50:31.283
Very sticky.

466
00:50:32.577 --> 00:50:36.038
Good. Now, Regan, you're gonna feel
something a little bit cold and wet.

467
00:50:46.801 --> 00:50:51.013
Okay. Now you're gonna feel
a little stick here. Don't move.

468
00:50:55.268 --> 00:50:56.393
Good.

469
00:51:01.232 --> 00:51:04.776
Okay. You're gonna feel
some pressure here. Now, don't move.

470
00:52:02.712 --> 00:52:03.837
Hook up.

471
00:52:36.538 --> 00:52:38.205
There's nothing there.

472
00:52:38.373 --> 00:52:40.833
No vascular displacement at all.

473
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.253
Do you want me to run another series?

474
00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:44.546
I don't think so.

475
00:52:44.713 --> 00:52:46.297
I'd like you to see her again.

476
00:52:46.757 --> 00:52:49.717
Excuse me, doctor.
Chris MacNeil is on the phone.

477
00:52:49.885 --> 00:52:51.469
She says it's urgent.

478
00:52:51.637 --> 00:52:54.139
- You got some time?
- Of course.

479
00:52:59.436 --> 00:53:01.104
- Dr. Klein?
- Yes, I'm Dr. Klein.

480
00:53:01.272 --> 00:53:02.897
- This is Dr. Taney.
- How do you do?

481
00:53:03.065 --> 00:53:05.567
Things have gotten worse since I phoned.
Come upstairs.

482
00:53:05.734 --> 00:53:08.194
- Is she having spasms again?
- They've gotten violent.

483
00:53:08.362 --> 00:53:10.363
- Did you give her the medication?
- Yes.

484
00:53:10.531 --> 00:53:13.074
- What was that?
- Thorazine.

485
00:53:13.242 --> 00:53:15.118
Before that, it was Ritalin.

486
00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.081
Chris, doctors.

487
00:53:20.249 --> 00:53:22.333
- This is Dr. Taney.
- Mother, please!

488
00:53:22.501 --> 00:53:24.253
- What is it?
- Please, make it stop!

489
00:53:24.421 --> 00:53:26.714
It's burning! It's burning!

490
00:53:26.882 --> 00:53:29.008
Do something, doctor. Please, help her.

491
00:53:29.176 --> 00:53:34.430
Please, Mother, make it stop!
He's trying to kill me!

492
00:53:34.598 --> 00:53:37.099
Mother! Mother!

493
00:53:41.605 --> 00:53:43.772
All right, Regan,
let's see what the trouble...

494
00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:44.940
Regan!

495
00:53:45.108 --> 00:53:47.359
Keep away! The sow is mine!

496
00:53:48.236 --> 00:53:52.364
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

497
00:54:01.958 --> 00:54:04.961
Stay away from me! Stay away!

498
00:54:06.088 --> 00:54:08.590
Hold her steady. Hold her tight!

499
00:54:08.758 --> 00:54:10.467
Don't let them!

500
00:54:34.659 --> 00:54:36.159
She's heavily sedated.

501
00:54:36.869 --> 00:54:39.329
She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.

502
00:54:41.123 --> 00:54:44.793
What was going on in there?
How could she fly off the bed like that?

503
00:54:45.586 --> 00:54:50.716
Pathological states can induce
abnormal strength...

504
00:54:51.176 --> 00:54:53.552
...accelerated motor performance.

505
00:54:54.054 --> 00:54:56.013
For example...

506
00:54:56.265 --> 00:55:00.351
...say a 90-pound woman sees her child
pinned under the wheel of a truck...

507
00:55:00.769 --> 00:55:04.146
...runs out and lifts the wheels
a half a foot up off the ground.

508
00:55:04.314 --> 00:55:06.774
You've heard the story. Same thing here.

509
00:55:08.402 --> 00:55:10.528
Same principle, I mean.

510
00:55:13.198 --> 00:55:14.991
So, what's wrong with her?

511
00:55:16.535 --> 00:55:18.369
We still think that the temporal lobe...

512
00:55:18.537 --> 00:55:21.580
Oh, what are you talking about,
for Christ's sakes?

513
00:55:21.748 --> 00:55:23.791
Did you see her or not?

514
00:55:23.959 --> 00:55:26.168
She's acting like she's fucking
out of her mind!

515
00:55:26.336 --> 00:55:30.716
Psychotic, like a split personality, or...

516
00:55:32.719 --> 00:55:34.636
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.

517
00:55:35.013 --> 00:55:37.431
There haven't been more than
100 authentic cases...

518
00:55:37.598 --> 00:55:41.184
...of so-called "split personality,"
Mrs. MacNeil.

519
00:55:42.103 --> 00:55:46.732
Now, I know the temptation is
to leap to psychiatry...

520
00:55:46.899 --> 00:55:51.570
...but any reasonable psychiatrist would
exhaust the somatic possibilities first.

521
00:55:54.532 --> 00:55:56.491
So, what's next?

522
00:55:56.909 --> 00:56:01.079
A pneumoencephalogram,
I would think, to pin down that lesion.

523
00:56:01.247 --> 00:56:03.165
It will involve another spinal.

524
00:56:03.333 --> 00:56:04.666
Oh, Christ!

525
00:56:04.834 --> 00:56:08.296
Well, what we missed in the EEG
and the arteriograms...

526
00:56:08.464 --> 00:56:11.049
...could conceivably turn up there.

527
00:56:11.884 --> 00:56:16.054
At least it would eliminate certain
other possibilities.

528
00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.111
Dr. Taney says the x-rays are negative.

529
00:56:33.113 --> 00:56:35.281
In other words, normal.

530
00:56:42.498 --> 00:56:44.040
You keep any drugs in your house?

531
00:56:44.208 --> 00:56:47.627
No, of course not. Nothing like that.

532
00:56:47.795 --> 00:56:49.045
Are you sure?

533
00:56:49.213 --> 00:56:51.465
Well, of course, I'm sure.

534
00:56:51.633 --> 00:56:53.133
I'd tell you.

535
00:56:53.301 --> 00:56:55.386
Christ, I don't even smoke grass.

536
00:57:00.725 --> 00:57:02.810
Are you planning to be home soon?

537
00:57:02.977 --> 00:57:05.062
I mean, uh, to L.A., I mean.

538
00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.272
Um...

539
00:57:08.149 --> 00:57:09.650
No, I, uh...

540
00:57:11.152 --> 00:57:13.278
I'm building a new house.

541
00:57:13.988 --> 00:57:16.073
My old one has been sold.

542
00:57:17.242 --> 00:57:18.992
I don't know.

543
00:57:21.162 --> 00:57:23.288
I was gonna take...

544
00:57:25.834 --> 00:57:30.462
I was gonna take Regan to Europe
for a while after she finished school.

545
00:57:32.925 --> 00:57:34.342
Why do you ask?

546
00:57:37.805 --> 00:57:41.057
I think it's time we started looking
for a psychiatrist.

547
00:58:10.129 --> 00:58:11.671
Hello?

548
00:58:26.104 --> 00:58:27.688
Sharon?

549
00:59:04.185 --> 00:59:05.435
Shit.

550
00:59:17.573 --> 00:59:18.782
God.

551
00:59:26.207 --> 00:59:27.707
Sharon!

552
00:59:31.087 --> 00:59:33.129
What do you mean,
leaving Regan by herself?

553
00:59:34.466 --> 00:59:36.226
Her window's wide open.
The room is freezing.

554
00:59:36.385 --> 00:59:38.010
- Didn't he tell you?
- Who?

555
00:59:38.178 --> 00:59:40.179
- Burke is...
- What's Burke got to do with it?

556
00:59:40.347 --> 00:59:42.765
Nobody was here.
When I went to get the Thorazine...

557
00:59:42.933 --> 00:59:45.309
- ...I had him stay with her, and...
- Oh.

558
00:59:45.477 --> 00:59:48.145
- I should have known better. Sorry.
- I guess you should have.

559
00:59:48.313 --> 00:59:49.647
How were the tests?

560
00:59:49.815 --> 00:59:52.149
We have to start looking for a shrink.

561
00:59:52.317 --> 00:59:53.943
Hi, Chuck. Come on in.

562
00:59:55.237 --> 00:59:56.487
I suppose you heard.

563
00:59:56.989 --> 00:59:58.322
Heard what?

564
01:00:00.909 --> 01:00:02.326
You haven't heard.

565
01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.621
Burke's dead.

566
01:00:09.209 --> 01:00:12.587
He must have been drunk. He fell from
the top of the steps right outside.

567
01:00:12.754 --> 01:00:15.339
By the time he hit M Street,
he broke his neck.

568
01:00:16.718 --> 01:00:18.010
Oh, God.

569
01:00:19.512 --> 01:00:20.762
No!

570
01:00:27.353 --> 01:00:28.395
Yeah, I know.

571
01:00:43.953 --> 01:00:46.538
Sharon...

572
01:00:46.706 --> 01:00:47.873
Oh, my God.

573
01:00:51.461 --> 01:00:53.670
Oh, my God.

574
01:01:01.805 --> 01:01:05.058
When I touch
your forehead, open your eyes.

575
01:01:12.191 --> 01:01:14.150
Are you comfortable, Regan?

576
01:01:16.904 --> 01:01:18.112
Yes.

577
01:01:19.698 --> 01:01:21.240
How old are you?

578
01:01:21.492 --> 01:01:22.784
Twelve.

579
01:01:24.328 --> 01:01:26.954
Is there someone inside you?

580
01:01:27.539 --> 01:01:29.040
Sometimes.

581
01:01:30.584 --> 01:01:31.834
Who is it?

582
01:01:32.878 --> 01:01:34.253
I don't know.

583
01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:37.173
Is it Captain Howdy?

584
01:01:37.341 --> 01:01:38.676
I don't know.

585
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:42.846
If I ask him to tell me,
will you let him answer?

586
01:01:43.932 --> 01:01:45.307
No.

587
01:01:46.142 --> 01:01:47.267
Why not?

588
01:01:47.852 --> 01:01:49.812
I'm afraid.

589
01:01:50.105 --> 01:01:52.564
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you.

590
01:01:52.732 --> 01:01:54.566
Do you want him to leave you?

591
01:01:55.318 --> 01:01:56.402
Yes.

592
01:02:05.245 --> 01:02:08.706
I'm speaking to the person
inside of Regan now.

593
01:02:08.873 --> 01:02:14.086
If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized
and must answer all my questions.

594
01:02:15.714 --> 01:02:17.297
Come forward...

595
01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:21.428
...and answer me now.

596
01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.398
Are you the person inside of Regan?

597
01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:39.112
Who are you?

598
01:02:48.622 --> 01:02:50.206
- Help me!
- Let go!

599
01:03:36.838 --> 01:03:38.714
Father Karras?

600
01:03:41.927 --> 01:03:43.470
Have we met?

601
01:03:44.639 --> 01:03:48.391
No, we haven't met,
but they said I could tell.

602
01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:51.061
That you look like a boxer.

603
01:03:51.771 --> 01:03:54.481
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.

604
01:03:55.066 --> 01:03:56.650
What's this all about?

605
01:03:56.818 --> 01:04:00.028
It's true. You do look like a boxer.

606
01:04:00.279 --> 01:04:03.323
Like John Garfield in Body and Soul.

607
01:04:03.491 --> 01:04:06.201
Exactly. John Garfield.
People tell you that, Father?

608
01:04:08.204 --> 01:04:10.247
Do people tell you
you look like Paul Newman?

609
01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:11.873
Always.

610
01:04:18.464 --> 01:04:21.842
Well, you know this director
who was doing the film here...

611
01:04:22.009 --> 01:04:23.511
...Burke Dennings?

612
01:04:23.679 --> 01:04:25.179
I've seen him.

613
01:04:25.347 --> 01:04:26.848
You've seen him.

614
01:04:27.683 --> 01:04:31.227
You're also familiar how last week
he died?

615
01:04:31.395 --> 01:04:33.104
Only what I read in the papers.

616
01:04:33.272 --> 01:04:37.942
Father, what do you know on
the subject of witchcraft?

617
01:04:38.485 --> 01:04:41.445
From the witching end, not the hunting.

618
01:04:41.613 --> 01:04:43.447
I once did a paper on it.

619
01:04:43.615 --> 01:04:44.824
Really?

620
01:04:44.992 --> 01:04:47.076
From the psychiatric end.

621
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:49.745
I know. I read it.

622
01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:54.083
All of this desecration in the church...

623
01:04:54.251 --> 01:04:57.587
...do you think this has anything to do
with witchcraft?

624
01:04:58.297 --> 01:05:01.299
Maybe. Some rituals used in
the black mass, maybe.

625
01:05:01.466 --> 01:05:05.971
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?

626
01:05:06.139 --> 01:05:07.472
In a fall.

627
01:05:10.727 --> 01:05:15.480
Let me tell you how.
And please, Father...

628
01:05:15.982 --> 01:05:17.691
...confidential.

629
01:05:19.193 --> 01:05:21.403
Burke Dennings, good Father...

630
01:05:21.571 --> 01:05:24.489
...was found at the bottom of those steps
leading to M Street...

631
01:05:24.657 --> 01:05:27.576
...with his head turned completely
around...

632
01:05:27.744 --> 01:05:29.703
...facing backwards.

633
01:05:35.335 --> 01:05:36.501
Didn't happen in the fall?

634
01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:38.754
It's possible.

635
01:05:40.548 --> 01:05:43.508
- Possible, however...
- Unlikely.

636
01:05:43.676 --> 01:05:45.135
Exactly.

637
01:05:46.555 --> 01:05:50.683
So on the one hand,
we've got a witchcraft kind of murder...

638
01:05:50.851 --> 01:05:56.314
...and on the other hand, a black mass-type
desecration in the church.

639
01:05:56.482 --> 01:05:59.692
You think the killer
and the desecrator are the same?

640
01:06:01.195 --> 01:06:02.737
Maybe somebody crazy...

641
01:06:02.905 --> 01:06:05.907
...somebody with a spite against
the Church.

642
01:06:06.075 --> 01:06:08.868
Some unconscious rebellion.

643
01:06:09.036 --> 01:06:10.370
A sick priest, is that it?

644
01:06:10.537 --> 01:06:15.208
Look, Father, this is hard for you.
Please, I understand...

645
01:06:15.376 --> 01:06:18.753
...but for priests on the campus here,
you're the psychiatrist.

646
01:06:18.921 --> 01:06:21.339
You'd know who was sick at the time,
who wasn't.

647
01:06:21.507 --> 01:06:24.300
I mean, this kind of sickness,
you'd know that.

648
01:06:24.468 --> 01:06:27.346
I don't know anyone who fits
that description.

649
01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:30.391
Ah.

650
01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.645
Doctor's ethics.
If you knew, you wouldn't tell, huh?

651
01:06:34.813 --> 01:06:35.980
No, I probably wouldn't.

652
01:06:36.606 --> 01:06:39.525
Not to bother you with trivia,
but a psychiatrist...

653
01:06:39.693 --> 01:06:42.528
...in sunny California, no less...

654
01:06:42.696 --> 01:06:47.157
...was put in jail for not telling the
police what he knew about a patient.

655
01:06:47.826 --> 01:06:52.121
- Is that a threat?
- No, I mention it only in passing.

656
01:06:53.748 --> 01:06:55.833
Incidentally,
I mention it only in passing...

657
01:06:56.001 --> 01:06:59.086
...I could always tell the judge it was
a matter of confession.

658
01:07:02.924 --> 01:07:05.175
Hey, Father, wait a minute.

659
01:07:05.343 --> 01:07:07.261
- Do you like movies?
- Very much.

660
01:07:07.429 --> 01:07:10.473
Well, I get passes
to the best shows in town.

661
01:07:10.641 --> 01:07:14.602
Mrs. K, though, you know,
she gets tired, never likes to go.

662
01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:16.896
- That's too bad.
- Yeah, I hate to go alone.

663
01:07:17.064 --> 01:07:19.566
I love to talk film...

664
01:07:19.734 --> 01:07:23.153
...discuss, to critique.

665
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.491
You want to see a film with me?
I got passes to the Crest. It's Othello.

666
01:07:28.659 --> 01:07:30.493
- Who's in it?
- Who's in it?

667
01:07:30.661 --> 01:07:34.622
Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona,
and Othello, Groucho Marx. You happy?

668
01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:36.791
- I've seen it.
- Ah.

669
01:07:37.126 --> 01:07:40.837
One last time. You can think
of some priest who fits the bill?

670
01:07:41.005 --> 01:07:45.300
- Come on.
- No, answer the question, Father Paranoia.

671
01:07:46.469 --> 01:07:49.137
All right. All right.

672
01:07:50.098 --> 01:07:52.641
- You know who I think really did it?
- Who?

673
01:07:52.809 --> 01:07:54.643
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

674
01:07:55.395 --> 01:07:57.897
I could have you deported,
you know that?

675
01:08:00.025 --> 01:08:01.233
I lied.

676
01:08:02.652 --> 01:08:04.487
You look like Sal Mineo.

677
01:08:08.825 --> 01:08:12.244
It looks like a type of disorder
that's, uh, rarely ever seen anymore...

678
01:08:12.412 --> 01:08:14.497
...except in primitive cultures.

679
01:08:14.873 --> 01:08:19.001
We call it, uh,
somnambular-form possession.

680
01:08:19.628 --> 01:08:22.338
Quite frankly, we really don't know
much about it at all...

681
01:08:22.506 --> 01:08:26.842
...except that it starts with a conflict
or a guilt...

682
01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:30.805
...and it leads to the patient's delusions
that his body has been invaded...

683
01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:34.810
...by some alien intelligence. Um...

684
01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:36.144
A spirit, if you will.

685
01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:39.815
Look, I'm telling you again,
and you'd better believe me...

686
01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:42.818
...I am not going to lock her up
in some goddamn asylum.

687
01:08:42.985 --> 01:08:45.654
- Well, it's out of...
- And I don't care what you call it.

688
01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:47.531
I'm not putting her away.

689
01:08:47.698 --> 01:08:49.199
Well, I'm sorry.

690
01:08:49.367 --> 01:08:51.201
You're sorry? Jesus Christ!

691
01:08:51.369 --> 01:08:56.081
Eighty-eight doctors, and all you can
tell me with all your bullshit is...

692
01:09:12.933 --> 01:09:17.728
Of course, there is one outside chance
for a cure.

693
01:09:18.522 --> 01:09:24.360
But, um, I think of it
as a shock treatment.

694
01:09:25.362 --> 01:09:27.321
As I said, it's a very outside chance...

695
01:09:27.489 --> 01:09:30.158
Would you just name it, for God's sakes?
What is it?

696
01:09:30.325 --> 01:09:32.827
- Do you have any religious beliefs?
- No.

697
01:09:32.995 --> 01:09:35.413
What about your daughter?

698
01:09:35.581 --> 01:09:37.373
No. Why?

699
01:09:37.583 --> 01:09:39.250
Have you ever heard of exorcism?

700
01:09:41.712 --> 01:09:44.422
Well, it's a stylized ritual...

701
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:51.179
...in which the, uh, rabbi or the priest try
to drive out the so-called invading spirit.

702
01:09:51.346 --> 01:09:53.432
It's been pretty much discarded
these days...

703
01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.353
...except by the Catholics, who keep it
in the closet as a sort of embarrassment.

704
01:09:58.563 --> 01:10:01.607
But it, uh, has worked, in fact...

705
01:10:01.774 --> 01:10:04.693
...although not for the reasons they think,
of course.

706
01:10:04.861 --> 01:10:08.614
It's purely force of suggestion.

707
01:10:08.781 --> 01:10:13.577
The, uh... The victim's belief in
possession is what helped cause it...

708
01:10:13.745 --> 01:10:15.370
...so in that same way...

709
01:10:15.538 --> 01:10:18.790
...the belief in the power of exorcism
can make it disappear.

710
01:10:21.169 --> 01:10:25.214
You're telling me that I should
take my daughter to a witch doctor.

711
01:10:26.132 --> 01:10:27.591
Is that it?

712
01:12:06.319 --> 01:12:07.944
Karl?

713
01:12:09.238 --> 01:12:11.740
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?

714
01:12:14.452 --> 01:12:16.411
She's going to be well?

715
01:12:17.621 --> 01:12:22.042
Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom,
I want you to tell me. Now, did you?

716
01:12:22.209 --> 01:12:24.878
No, not me.

717
01:12:25.046 --> 01:12:26.087
I didn't.

718
01:12:44.274 --> 01:12:47.610
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?

719
01:12:47.986 --> 01:12:49.403
Of course, I didn't.

720
01:12:50.989 --> 01:12:52.198
I didn't put it.

721
01:12:53.992 --> 01:12:56.410
- Excuse me, madam.
- What?

722
01:12:57.454 --> 01:12:59.622
- A man to see you.
- What man?

723
01:13:06.213 --> 01:13:08.589
Might your daughter remember, perhaps...

724
01:13:08.757 --> 01:13:11.759
...if Mr. Dennings was in her room
that night?

725
01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:15.137
- Why do you ask?
- Mm.

726
01:13:15.555 --> 01:13:17.390
Might she remember?

727
01:13:19.559 --> 01:13:22.854
No, she was heavily sedated.

728
01:13:23.356 --> 01:13:24.815
It's serious?

729
01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:27.275
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

730
01:13:28.736 --> 01:13:31.196
- May I ask...?
- We still don't know.

731
01:13:32.156 --> 01:13:33.740
Watch out for drafts.

732
01:13:33.908 --> 01:13:39.329
A draft in the fall when the house is hot
is a magic carpet for bacteria.

733
01:13:39.497 --> 01:13:41.289
Excuse me, madam. Anything else?

734
01:13:41.457 --> 01:13:43.583
No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you.

735
01:13:44.168 --> 01:13:45.961
It's all right, Karl.

736
01:13:50.174 --> 01:13:51.800
Why are you asking all this?

737
01:13:51.968 --> 01:13:53.343
It's strange.

738
01:13:54.595 --> 01:13:59.015
The deceased comes to visit,
stays only 20 minutes...

739
01:13:59.183 --> 01:14:03.354
...and leaves all alone a very sick girl.

740
01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:06.607
And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil...

741
01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:11.904
...it isn't likely he would fall
from a window.

742
01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:15.450
Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck
what we found.

743
01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:18.453
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.

744
01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:21.247
No. My hunch...

745
01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:24.792
My opinion...

746
01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.963
...he was killed by a very powerful man:
point one.

747
01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.800
And the fracturing of
his skull: point two...

748
01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:35.720
...plus the various other things
we mentioned...

749
01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:39.849
...would make it very probable...

750
01:14:40.017 --> 01:14:42.811
...probable, not certain...

751
01:14:43.438 --> 01:14:49.234
...that the deceased was killed and
then pushed from your daughter's window.

752
01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:53.989
But nobody was in the room
except your daughter, so how can this be?

753
01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:00.162
It could be one way.

754
01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:03.457
If someone came calling
between the time Miss Spencer left...

755
01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:05.792
...and the time you returned.

756
01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.462
Judas Priest, just a second.

757
01:15:09.464 --> 01:15:12.549
- The servants? They have visitors?
- Not at all.

758
01:15:12.717 --> 01:15:15.260
You were expecting a package that day,
some delivery?

759
01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:16.637
Not that I know of.

760
01:15:16.804 --> 01:15:19.473
Groceries, cleaning, uh, a package?

761
01:15:19.641 --> 01:15:22.351
I really wouldn't know.
See, Karl takes care of all that.

762
01:15:24.438 --> 01:15:25.730
I see.

763
01:15:25.898 --> 01:15:27.857
Would you like to ask him?

764
01:15:28.734 --> 01:15:31.194
No, never mind, it's...

765
01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:34.864
It's very remote.

766
01:15:35.574 --> 01:15:38.117
No, never mind.

767
01:15:38.619 --> 01:15:40.161
Yeah.

768
01:15:48.671 --> 01:15:50.630
Would you like some more coffee?

769
01:15:51.298 --> 01:15:52.966
Please.

770
01:16:27.919 --> 01:16:29.336
That's cute.

771
01:16:30.589 --> 01:16:32.840
Your daughter, she's the artist?

772
01:16:35.135 --> 01:16:37.177
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

773
01:16:37.846 --> 01:16:39.680
Incidentally, um...

774
01:16:40.724 --> 01:16:42.516
...you might ask your daughter...

775
01:16:42.684 --> 01:16:46.021
...if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings
in her room that night.

776
01:16:46.188 --> 01:16:49.524
Look, he wouldn't have any reason
in the world to go up to her room.

777
01:16:49.692 --> 01:16:52.777
Oh, I know, I realize...

778
01:16:53.112 --> 01:16:56.448
...but if certain British doctors never
asked, "What is this fungus?"...

779
01:16:56.616 --> 01:16:59.826
...we wouldn't today have penicillin.
Correct?

780
01:17:00.077 --> 01:17:03.663
Well, when she's better, I'll ask her.

781
01:17:03.831 --> 01:17:06.458
- Yeah, couldn't hurt.
- Okay.

782
01:17:06.626 --> 01:17:09.044
Uh, in the meantime...

783
01:17:10.546 --> 01:17:11.880
That's okay.

784
01:17:12.048 --> 01:17:16.217
- I really hate to ask you this, but...
- What?

785
01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:20.555
For my daughter,
could you please give an autograph?

786
01:17:20.723 --> 01:17:23.099
Of course. Uh, where's a pencil?

787
01:17:23.267 --> 01:17:25.101
Right here. Here.

788
01:17:25.686 --> 01:17:26.978
Oh.

789
01:17:27.356 --> 01:17:28.564
She'd love it.

790
01:17:30.192 --> 01:17:31.734
And what's her name?

791
01:17:34.279 --> 01:17:36.530
I lied. it's for me.

792
01:17:38.325 --> 01:17:42.370
- The spelling is on the back: Kinderman.
- Okay.

793
01:17:42.788 --> 01:17:45.956
You know that film you made, um, Angel?

794
01:17:46.124 --> 01:17:48.542
- Oh, yeah.
- I saw that six times.

795
01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:50.920
- Really?
- It was beautiful.

796
01:17:51.338 --> 01:17:53.881
Ha, ha. Thank you.

797
01:17:56.551 --> 01:17:59.720
You're a very nice lady.

798
01:18:01.973 --> 01:18:04.308
- Thank you.
- You're a nice man.

799
01:18:05.268 --> 01:18:08.479
Uh, I'll come back
when she's feeling better.

800
01:18:12.276 --> 01:18:14.111
- Bye.
- Bye.

801
01:18:34.966 --> 01:18:36.925
Please, no!

802
01:18:37.093 --> 01:18:39.177
- Do it!
- Please, don't!

803
01:18:39.345 --> 01:18:42.723
<i>You bitch! Do it! Do it!</i>

804
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:44.474
Please, no!

805
01:18:46.978 --> 01:18:50.064
<i>Yes! Let Jesus fuck you!</i>

806
01:18:50.232 --> 01:18:53.151
<i>Let Jesus fuck you! Let him fuck you!</i>

807
01:18:57.448 --> 01:18:58.489
Aah!

808
01:18:58.657 --> 01:19:01.492
Give it! Give it to me! Aah!

809
01:19:02.202 --> 01:19:05.663
- Ugh!
<i>- Lick me! Lick me!</i>

810
01:19:11.170 --> 01:19:12.253
Chris!

811
01:19:13.881 --> 01:19:16.966
Mrs. MacNeil, open the door!

812
01:19:24.266 --> 01:19:25.516
Open the door!

813
01:19:25.684 --> 01:19:28.144
<i>Do you know what she did...</i>

814
01:19:28.312 --> 01:19:30.354
<i>...your cunting daughter?</i>

815
01:19:50.376 --> 01:19:52.002
Chris MacNeil?

816
01:19:52.337 --> 01:19:53.378
Please, go away.

817
01:19:53.546 --> 01:19:55.631
I'm Father Karras.

818
01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:59.426
I'm very sorry. Hello.

819
01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:01.929
I should have told you
I wouldn't be in uniform.

820
01:20:02.096 --> 01:20:03.680
Yeah, that would have helped.

821
01:20:03.848 --> 01:20:06.225
- Have you got a cigarette, Father?
- Sure.

822
01:20:10.230 --> 01:20:11.396
Thanks.

823
01:20:23.577 --> 01:20:24.911
Cold.

824
01:20:25.079 --> 01:20:26.246
Yeah.

825
01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:29.582
Uh...

826
01:20:30.751 --> 01:20:33.211
How did a shrink ever get to be a priest?

827
01:20:33.379 --> 01:20:36.339
It's the other way around. The Society
sent me through medical school.

828
01:20:36.507 --> 01:20:37.632
Oh.

829
01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.133
Where?

830
01:20:40.052 --> 01:20:43.555
Harvard, Bellevue, Johns Hopkins.

831
01:20:43.722 --> 01:20:46.099
- Places like that.
- I see.

832
01:20:47.977 --> 01:20:50.937
- You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?
- Yes, I am.

833
01:20:51.105 --> 01:20:53.481
- Pretty close?
- Pretty close.

834
01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:55.526
Did he talk to you about my party?

835
01:20:55.694 --> 01:20:57.278
He sure did.

836
01:20:57.821 --> 01:20:59.363
About my daughter?

837
01:20:59.531 --> 01:21:01.323
No, I didn't know you had one.

838
01:21:03.618 --> 01:21:06.161
- He didn't mention her?
- No.

839
01:21:06.329 --> 01:21:07.955
Oh.

840
01:21:08.415 --> 01:21:10.624
Didn't tell you what she did?

841
01:21:10.792 --> 01:21:12.668
He didn't mention her.

842
01:21:14.296 --> 01:21:16.714
Priests are pretty tight-mouthed,
then, huh?

843
01:21:16.882 --> 01:21:18.883
That depends.

844
01:21:19.175 --> 01:21:21.176
- On what?
- The priest.

845
01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:23.429
Sure.

846
01:21:24.931 --> 01:21:28.559
I mean, what if a person,
uh, came to you...

847
01:21:28.727 --> 01:21:31.979
...you know, that was a murderer
or criminal of some kind...

848
01:21:32.147 --> 01:21:35.400
...and they wanted some kind of help?

849
01:21:35.568 --> 01:21:37.569
I mean, would you have to turn him in?

850
01:21:37.737 --> 01:21:40.780
Well, if he came to me for
spiritual advice, I'd say no.

851
01:21:40.948 --> 01:21:42.908
- You wouldn't?
- No, I wouldn't.

852
01:21:43.451 --> 01:21:45.535
But I would try to convince him
to turn himself in.

853
01:21:45.703 --> 01:21:47.162
Mm-hm.

854
01:21:47.538 --> 01:21:51.625
And, uh, how do you go about
getting an exorcism?

855
01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.380
I beg your pardon?

856
01:22:00.843 --> 01:22:06.389
If, um... If a person's, you know,
possessed by a demon, or something...

857
01:22:06.557 --> 01:22:08.975
...how do they get an exorcism?

858
01:22:09.685 --> 01:22:13.647
I'd have to get them into a time machine
and get them back to the 16th century.

859
01:22:13.814 --> 01:22:15.482
I didn't get you.

860
01:22:15.650 --> 01:22:17.860
It just doesn't happen anymore,
Mrs. MacNeil.

861
01:22:18.028 --> 01:22:19.737
Oh, yeah? Since when?

862
01:22:21.031 --> 01:22:24.992
Well, since we learned about mental
illness, paranoia, schizophrenia.

863
01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:27.119
All those things they taught me
at Harvard.

864
01:22:27.287 --> 01:22:29.956
Mrs. MacNeil,
since the day I joined the Jesuits...

865
01:22:30.123 --> 01:22:33.876
...I've never met one priest
who has performed an exorcism. Not one.

866
01:22:35.295 --> 01:22:37.171
Yeah, well...

867
01:22:39.633 --> 01:22:43.427
...it just so happens that somebody
very close to me...

868
01:22:43.887 --> 01:22:45.554
...is probably possessed.

869
01:22:46.556 --> 01:22:48.265
And needs an exorcist.

870
01:22:48.725 --> 01:22:51.560
Father Karras, it's my little girl.

871
01:22:53.105 --> 01:22:55.356
Then that's all the more reason
to forget about exorcism.

872
01:22:55.524 --> 01:22:56.774
Why? I don't understand.

873
01:22:56.942 --> 01:22:59.653
- To begin with, it could make things worse.
- Oh, how?

874
01:22:59.821 --> 01:23:02.072
Secondly, the Church,
before it approves an exorcism...

875
01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:05.450
...conducts an investigation to see if
it's warranted. That takes time.

876
01:23:05.618 --> 01:23:07.258
- Yeah, but...
- Meanwhile, your daughter...

877
01:23:07.328 --> 01:23:10.038
- You could do it yourself.
- No. I'd need Church approval...

878
01:23:10.206 --> 01:23:13.041
- ...and that's rarely given.
- But... Uh...

879
01:23:15.086 --> 01:23:16.670
- Could you see her?
- Yes, I could.

880
01:23:16.838 --> 01:23:18.558
I could see her as a psychiatrist, but l...

881
01:23:18.715 --> 01:23:21.049
Oh, not a psychiatrist. She needs a priest.

882
01:23:21.217 --> 01:23:24.886
She's seen every fucking psychiatrist
in the world, and they sent me to you.

883
01:23:25.054 --> 01:23:26.805
Now are you gonna send me
back to them?

884
01:23:26.973 --> 01:23:29.850
- Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?
- You don't understand...

885
01:23:30.018 --> 01:23:33.103
Oh, God, can't you help her?
Just help her!

886
01:24:04.136 --> 01:24:05.887
It wants no straps.

887
01:24:21.529 --> 01:24:22.863
Hello, Regan.

888
01:24:26.451 --> 01:24:29.286
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.

889
01:24:29.996 --> 01:24:32.372
You might loosen these straps, then.

890
01:24:33.333 --> 01:24:35.667
I'm afraid you might hurt yourself,
Regan.

891
01:24:36.377 --> 01:24:38.504
<i>I'm not Regan.</i>

892
01:24:39.339 --> 01:24:40.631
I see.

893
01:24:45.553 --> 01:24:48.472
Well, then, let's introduce ourselves.
I'm Damien Karras.

894
01:24:48.681 --> 01:24:50.265
<i>And I'm the devil.</i>

895
01:24:50.433 --> 01:24:52.351
<i>Now, kindly undo these straps.</i>

896
01:24:53.019 --> 01:24:55.604
If you're the devil,
why not make the straps disappear?

897
01:24:55.772 --> 01:24:58.941
<i>That's much too vulgar a display
of power, Karras.</i>

898
01:25:00.401 --> 01:25:01.736
Where's Regan?

899
01:25:02.029 --> 01:25:03.863
<i>In here, with us.</i>

900
01:25:06.075 --> 01:25:08.326
Show me Regan
and I'll loosen one of the straps.

901
01:25:09.245 --> 01:25:12.122
<i>Could you help an old altar boy, Father?</i>

902
01:25:13.082 --> 01:25:15.458
<i>Your mother's in here with us, Karras.</i>

903
01:25:15.626 --> 01:25:17.710
<i>Would you like to leave a message?</i>

904
01:25:17.878 --> 01:25:20.130
I'll see that she gets it.

905
01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:27.053
If that's true...

906
01:25:29.598 --> 01:25:32.475
...then you must know my mother's
maiden name.

907
01:25:34.061 --> 01:25:42.061
What is it?

908
01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:40.462
Thank you.

909
01:26:42.965 --> 01:26:47.802
Look, I'm only against the possibility of
doing your daughter more harm than good.

910
01:26:48.221 --> 01:26:51.306
Nothing you could do
could make it any worse.

911
01:26:51.849 --> 01:26:53.516
I can't do it.

912
01:26:54.143 --> 01:26:56.269
I need evidence that the Church
would accept...

913
01:26:56.437 --> 01:26:58.313
- ...as signs of possession.
- Like what?

914
01:26:58.481 --> 01:27:00.899
Speaking in a language
she's never known or studied.

915
01:27:01.067 --> 01:27:02.400
What else?

916
01:27:03.653 --> 01:27:06.989
I don't know. I'd have to look it up.

917
01:27:07.157 --> 01:27:09.533
I thought you were supposed
to be an expert.

918
01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:12.328
There are no experts.

919
01:27:13.163 --> 01:27:16.624
You probably know as much about
possession as most priests.

920
01:27:17.209 --> 01:27:19.502
Look, your daughter doesn't say
she's a demon.

921
01:27:19.670 --> 01:27:22.046
She says she's the devil himself.

922
01:27:22.214 --> 01:27:24.340
If you've seen as many psychotics
as I have...

923
01:27:24.508 --> 01:27:28.177
...you'd realize that's the same thing
as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte.

924
01:27:29.388 --> 01:27:33.975
You asked me what I think is best
for your daughter.

925
01:27:34.851 --> 01:27:40.606
Six months under observation
in the best hospital you can find.

926
01:27:43.235 --> 01:27:45.319
You show me Regan's double...

927
01:27:45.487 --> 01:27:49.574
...same face, same voice, everything...

928
01:27:49.742 --> 01:27:51.785
...and I'd know it wasn't Regan.

929
01:27:52.704 --> 01:27:54.288
I'd know in my gut.

930
01:27:55.707 --> 01:27:59.293
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs
isn't my daughter.

931
01:28:00.003 --> 01:28:02.421
I want you to tell me that you know
for a fact...

932
01:28:02.588 --> 01:28:05.674
...that there's nothing wrong
with my daughter except in her mind.

933
01:28:05.842 --> 01:28:08.885
Tell me you know for a fact
that an exorcism wouldn't do any good.

934
01:28:09.053 --> 01:28:11.013
You tell me that!

935
01:28:22.567 --> 01:28:25.444
Did Regan know a priest was
coming over?

936
01:28:26.904 --> 01:28:30.033
- No.
- Did you know my mother died recently?

937
01:28:30.743 --> 01:28:33.244
- Yes, I did. I'm very sorry.
- No.

938
01:28:33.912 --> 01:28:35.580
Is Regan aware of it?

939
01:28:36.957 --> 01:28:38.249
Not at all.

940
01:28:39.752 --> 01:28:41.085
Why do you ask?

941
01:28:42.921 --> 01:28:44.922
It's not important. Good night.

942
01:29:11.576 --> 01:29:13.577
Hello?

943
01:29:15.955 --> 01:29:20.250
- Here, take it and just don't...
- Okay. Um.

944
01:29:20.418 --> 01:29:21.877
<i>Hello, Daddy?</i>

945
01:29:22.045 --> 01:29:23.629
<i>This is me.</i>

946
01:29:24.422 --> 01:29:27.549
<i>- What should I say? I don't know.
- Just talk to your daddy.</i>

947
01:29:27.717 --> 01:29:30.052
<i>- Anything you want.
- All right, um...</i>

948
01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:34.932
<i>Tell him what you've been doing
and how you're feeling and like that.</i>

949
01:29:36.434 --> 01:29:37.684
<i>Uh...</i>

950
01:29:37.852 --> 01:29:40.312
<i>Well, you see, um...</i>

951
01:29:40.730 --> 01:29:43.816
<i>I mean, I hope you can hear me.
Can you hear me okay?</i>

952
01:29:43.983 --> 01:29:46.183
<i>- Well, uh, let me see.
- He's not gonna answer you.</i>

953
01:29:46.319 --> 01:29:48.404
<i>Uh, ha-ha-ha.</i>

954
01:29:48.571 --> 01:29:50.907
<i>- Go on. Talk to your daddy, honey.
- Um...</i>

955
01:29:51.075 --> 01:29:53.410
<i>I don't know what to say, though. Um...</i>

956
01:29:53.869 --> 01:29:57.163
<i>Well, let's see. First we... No.</i>

957
01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:00.667
<i>- Wait. I don't know.
- Come on, Regan.</i>

958
01:30:00.835 --> 01:30:02.836
<i>- Tell him about Washington.
- Okay.</i>

959
01:30:03.003 --> 01:30:05.839
<i>See, we're in Washington now,
Daddy, and...</i>

960
01:30:08.134 --> 01:30:11.719
He broke the bread,
gave it to his disciples and said:

961
01:30:14.515 --> 01:30:17.058
"Take this, all of you, and eat it..."

962
01:30:20.896 --> 01:30:22.188
"...for this is my body."

963
01:30:28.904 --> 01:30:31.824
When the supper was ended,
he took the cup.

964
01:30:32.284 --> 01:30:35.244
Again he gave you thanks and praise.

965
01:30:35.871 --> 01:30:39.248
He gave the cup to his disciples and said,
"Take this..."

966
01:30:39.583 --> 01:30:41.959
"...all of you, and drink from it."

967
01:30:45.338 --> 01:30:47.923
"This is the cup of my blood."

968
01:30:49.426 --> 01:30:53.512
"The blood of the new and everlasting
covenant, the mystery of faith."

969
01:30:54.806 --> 01:30:57.224
<i>What an excellent day for an exorcism.</i>

970
01:30:59.394 --> 01:31:00.603
You'd like that?

971
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:02.688
<i>Intensely.</i>

972
01:31:03.565 --> 01:31:05.941
But wouldn't that drive you
out of Regan?

973
01:31:06.109 --> 01:31:08.360
<i>It would bring us together.</i>

974
01:31:09.738 --> 01:31:10.946
You and Regan?

975
01:31:11.114 --> 01:31:12.824
<i>You and us.</i>

976
01:31:24.086 --> 01:31:28.006
- Did you do that?
- Uh-huh.

977
01:31:32.929 --> 01:31:34.930
- Do it again.
<i>- In time.</i>

978
01:31:35.097 --> 01:31:36.681
No, now.

979
01:31:36.849 --> 01:31:38.600
<i>In time.</i>

980
01:31:39.644 --> 01:31:43.021
<i>Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?</i>

981
01:31:44.524 --> 01:31:45.774
You speak Latin?

982
01:31:46.798 --> 01:31:48.798
<i>Ego te absolvo.</i>

983
01:31:49.822 --> 01:31:51.322
Quod nomen mihi est?

984
01:31:51.346 --> 01:31:53.346
<i>Bonjour!</i>

985
01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:54.971
Quod nomen mihi est?

986
01:31:55.095 --> 01:31:56.744
<i>La plume de ma tante.</i>

987
01:31:56.745 --> 01:31:59.038
How long are you planning
to stay in Regan?

988
01:31:59.581 --> 01:32:02.083
<i>Until she rots and lies stinking
in the earth.</i>

989
01:32:05.212 --> 01:32:06.337
<i>What's that?</i>

990
01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.548
Holy water.

991
01:32:09.925 --> 01:32:11.467
<i>You keep it away.</i>

992
01:32:14.805 --> 01:32:16.806
<i>It burns!</i>

993
01:32:16.974 --> 01:32:19.475
<i>Oh, it burns!</i>

994
01:32:41.225 --> 01:32:42.225
<i>No one.</i>

995
01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:43.584
Who are you?

996
01:32:43.608 --> 01:32:44.608
<i>No one!</i>

997
01:32:55.972 --> 01:32:59.141
You know, I'm, like, in seclusion.

998
01:33:02.854 --> 01:33:05.314
No, I'm just exhausted from work.

999
01:33:07.650 --> 01:33:09.067
Um...

1000
01:33:09.527 --> 01:33:11.862
She's... She's all right.

1001
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:13.905
She's just a little...

1002
01:33:16.702 --> 01:33:18.494
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

1003
01:33:21.373 --> 01:33:23.166
Um...

1004
01:33:23.459 --> 01:33:27.712
Okay, I'll talk to you. I'll call you
as soon as it's over, all right?

1005
01:33:29.048 --> 01:33:31.424
No, I just... I'm really...
I'm going through something...

1006
01:33:31.592 --> 01:33:33.509
...and I just have to, uh...

1007
01:33:34.553 --> 01:33:36.220
No, no. No, no.

1008
01:33:36.472 --> 01:33:38.348
There's nothing.

1009
01:33:39.141 --> 01:33:40.808
Hey, thanks a lot.

1010
01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:43.061
Bye, now.

1011
01:33:57.117 --> 01:33:59.370
- Want a drink?
- Please.

1012
01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.413
What do you drink?

1013
01:34:01.581 --> 01:34:03.165
Uh, Scotch.

1014
01:34:04.584 --> 01:34:07.878
- Ice, water.
- Okay.

1015
01:34:13.551 --> 01:34:15.719
No ice. I'll get some from the kitchen.

1016
01:34:15.929 --> 01:34:17.529
- No, I'll take it straight.
- It's fine.

1017
01:34:17.597 --> 01:34:18.597
No, please, sit.

1018
01:34:18.765 --> 01:34:20.724
- Really? You sure?
- Yeah, sit.

1019
01:34:32.278 --> 01:34:33.904
Where's her father?

1020
01:34:34.072 --> 01:34:35.280
In Europe.

1021
01:34:35.448 --> 01:34:37.282
- Have you told him what's happening?
- No.

1022
01:34:37.450 --> 01:34:39.744
Well, I think you should.

1023
01:34:47.336 --> 01:34:52.632
I told Regan that was holy water. I sprinkled
it on her and she reacted very violently.

1024
01:34:54.552 --> 01:34:55.802
It's tap water.

1025
01:34:55.970 --> 01:34:57.053
What's the difference?

1026
01:34:57.221 --> 01:35:01.975
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't
help support a case for possession.

1027
01:35:12.445 --> 01:35:15.905
She killed Burke Dennings.

1028
01:35:16.073 --> 01:35:17.282
What?

1029
01:35:20.996 --> 01:35:23.038
She killed Burke Dennings.

1030
01:35:24.666 --> 01:35:27.501
She pushed him out her window.

1031
01:35:41.183 --> 01:35:42.266
<i>Who are you?</i>

1032
01:35:45.437 --> 01:35:47.897
It's a language, all right. It's English.

1033
01:35:49.357 --> 01:35:50.483
What do you mean?

1034
01:35:50.650 --> 01:35:52.860
It's English in reverse. Listen.

1035
01:35:53.528 --> 01:35:55.279
<i>Give us time.</i>

1036
01:35:55.447 --> 01:35:57.406
<i>Let her die.</i>

1037
01:36:00.368 --> 01:36:02.954
<i>I am no one. I am no one.</i>

1038
01:36:03.122 --> 01:36:04.414
<i>Fear the priest.</i>

1039
01:36:06.417 --> 01:36:08.084
<i>Fear the priest.</i>

1040
01:36:10.797 --> 01:36:12.214
<i>Merrin!</i>

1041
01:36:19.931 --> 01:36:22.057
<i>I am no one.</i>

1042
01:36:24.435 --> 01:36:25.894
<i>Merrin! Fear the priest.</i>

1043
01:36:27.939 --> 01:36:33.068
<i>Merrin!</i>

1044
01:36:33.653 --> 01:36:37.948
Yeah?

1045
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.242
I'll be right there.

1046
01:36:58.762 --> 01:37:00.513
I don't want Chris to see this.

1047
01:37:00.681 --> 01:37:03.224
- Well, what's wrong? What is it?
- Shh.

1048
01:38:12.046 --> 01:38:14.380
You're convinced that it's genuine?

1049
01:38:14.924 --> 01:38:16.341
I don't know.

1050
01:38:17.509 --> 01:38:19.802
No, not really, I suppose.

1051
01:38:20.304 --> 01:38:22.347
But I have made...

1052
01:38:22.514 --> 01:38:26.893
...a prudent judgment that it meets
the conditions set down in The Ritual.

1053
01:38:27.102 --> 01:38:29.562
You would want to do the exorcism
yourself?

1054
01:38:30.856 --> 01:38:32.106
Yes.

1055
01:38:35.903 --> 01:38:37.904
Might be best to have a man
with experience.

1056
01:38:38.072 --> 01:38:41.366
Maybe someone who's spent time
in foreign missions.

1057
01:38:42.034 --> 01:38:43.993
I understand, Your Excellency.

1058
01:38:44.453 --> 01:38:45.703
Let's see who's around.

1059
01:38:45.871 --> 01:38:49.041
In the meantime,
I'll call you as soon as I know.

1060
01:38:49.876 --> 01:38:52.169
Thank you, Your Excellency.

1061
01:38:52.545 --> 01:38:54.630
Well, he does know the background.

1062
01:38:54.798 --> 01:38:58.258
I doubt there's any danger in just
having him assist.

1063
01:38:58.426 --> 01:39:01.136
There should be a psychiatrist present,
anyway.

1064
01:39:01.304 --> 01:39:03.097
What about the exorcist?

1065
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:04.807
Have you any ideas?

1066
01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:07.893
How about Lankester Merrin?

1067
01:39:08.353 --> 01:39:09.895
Merrin?

1068
01:39:10.188 --> 01:39:11.689
I had a notion he was in Iraq.

1069
01:39:11.856 --> 01:39:14.066
I read he was working on a dig
near Nineveh.

1070
01:39:14.234 --> 01:39:15.734
You're right, but he's finished.

1071
01:39:15.902 --> 01:39:19.405
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.

1072
01:39:19.572 --> 01:39:21.240
What's he doing there, teaching?

1073
01:39:21.408 --> 01:39:23.993
He's working on another book.

1074
01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:28.039
Don't you think he's too old, Tom?
How's his health?

1075
01:39:28.374 --> 01:39:31.918
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.

1076
01:39:32.545 --> 01:39:33.628
Mm.

1077
01:39:33.796 --> 01:39:37.340
- Besides, he's had experience.
- I didn't know that.

1078
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:39.759
Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa.

1079
01:39:39.927 --> 01:39:43.847
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.

1080
01:39:48.269 --> 01:39:49.644
Father?

1081
01:40:56.422 --> 01:40:58.507
- You're Mrs. MacNeil?
- Yes.

1082
01:40:58.674 --> 01:41:00.050
I'm Father Merrin.

1083
01:41:00.259 --> 01:41:02.552
- Come in.
- Thank you.

1084
01:41:03.137 --> 01:41:04.679
- Is Father Karras here?
- Yes.

1085
01:41:04.847 --> 01:41:06.890
- He's here already.
- Father?

1086
01:41:07.517 --> 01:41:10.519
- Father Karras.
- It's an honor to meet you, Father.

1087
01:41:17.026 --> 01:41:19.111
- Are you very tired?
- No.

1088
01:41:20.363 --> 01:41:23.365
I'd like you to go quickly across
to the Residence, Damien...

1089
01:41:23.533 --> 01:41:25.367
...and gather up a cassock for myself...

1090
01:41:25.535 --> 01:41:29.496
...two surplices, a purple stole,
and some holy water...

1091
01:41:29.664 --> 01:41:31.206
...and, um...

1092
01:41:31.542 --> 01:41:34.502
...your copy of The Roman Ritual.
The large one.

1093
01:41:34.670 --> 01:41:36.379
I believe we should begin.

1094
01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:39.298
Do you want to hear the background
of the case first?

1095
01:41:39.466 --> 01:41:40.716
Why?

1096
01:41:41.218 --> 01:41:43.386
This is yours to do with as you please.

1097
01:41:43.554 --> 01:41:47.140
You can choose to escape, if you want,
but you may never be able to return.

1098
01:41:47.307 --> 01:41:49.142
Don't let anyone decide for you.

1099
01:42:02.114 --> 01:42:04.740
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1100
01:42:17.630 --> 01:42:19.756
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

1101
01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:23.594
Thank you very much.

1102
01:42:23.761 --> 01:42:25.179
You're welcome.

1103
01:42:35.481 --> 01:42:37.774
Would you like some brandy in that,
Father?

1104
01:42:39.819 --> 01:42:42.112
Well, the doctors say I shouldn't.

1105
01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:44.281
But thank God...

1106
01:42:44.449 --> 01:42:46.575
...my will is weak.

1107
01:42:55.461 --> 01:43:00.423
<i>Especially important is the warning
to avoid conversations with the demon.</i>

1108
01:43:00.591 --> 01:43:04.969
We may ask what is relevant,
but anything beyond that is dangerous.

1109
01:43:05.137 --> 01:43:07.263
He's a liar. The demon is a liar.

1110
01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:09.807
He will lie to confuse us.

1111
01:43:10.935 --> 01:43:15.021
But he will also mix lies with the truth...

1112
01:43:15.648 --> 01:43:16.981
...to attack us.

1113
01:43:18.067 --> 01:43:20.735
<i>The attack is psychological, Damien.</i>

1114
01:43:21.695 --> 01:43:23.154
<i>And powerful.</i>

1115
01:43:23.989 --> 01:43:25.490
<i>So don't listen.</i>

1116
01:43:25.658 --> 01:43:28.743
<i>Remember that. Do not listen.</i>

1117
01:43:30.454 --> 01:43:32.830
It might be helpful
if I gave you some background...

1118
01:43:32.998 --> 01:43:35.542
...on the different personalities Regan
has manifested.

1119
01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:37.586
So far, I'd say there seem to be three.

1120
01:43:38.129 --> 01:43:40.381
- She's convinced that she's...
- There is only one.

1121
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:07.408
What is your daughter's middle name,
Mrs. MacNeil?

1122
01:44:07.701 --> 01:44:09.201
Teresa.

1123
01:44:12.247 --> 01:44:14.290
What a lovely name.

1124
01:44:50.286 --> 01:44:52.162
<i>Stick your cock up her ass...</i>

1125
01:44:52.330 --> 01:44:55.081
<i>...you motherfucking
worthless cocksucker.</i>

1126
01:44:55.249 --> 01:44:58.002
- Be silent!
- Aah!

1127
01:45:09.264 --> 01:45:11.766
Our Father, who art in heaven...

1128
01:45:13.185 --> 01:45:14.602
...hallowed be thy name.

1129
01:45:14.770 --> 01:45:16.479
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done...

1130
01:45:16.688 --> 01:45:18.731
...on earth as it is in heaven.

1131
01:45:18.899 --> 01:45:21.442
Give us this day our daily bread.

1132
01:45:22.027 --> 01:45:24.570
Forgive us our trespasses...

1133
01:45:24.738 --> 01:45:27.448
...as we forgive those who trespass
against us.

1134
01:45:27.616 --> 01:45:29.825
And lead us not into temptation.

1135
01:45:29.993 --> 01:45:31.535
But deliver us from the evil one.

1136
01:45:31.745 --> 01:45:35.456
Save me, O God, by thy name.
By thy might, defend my cause.

1137
01:45:37.292 --> 01:45:42.214
Proud men have risen up against me,
and men of violence seek my life...

1138
01:45:42.382 --> 01:45:46.927
...but God is my helper
and the Lord sustains my life.

1139
01:45:47.095 --> 01:45:48.762
In every need, he has delivered me.

1140
01:45:48.930 --> 01:45:51.598
Glory be to the Father,
to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

1141
01:45:51.766 --> 01:45:54.810
As it was in the beginning,
is now and shall be, world without end.

1142
01:45:54.977 --> 01:45:58.146
- Save your servant.
- Who places her trust in thee, my God.

1143
01:45:58.314 --> 01:46:01.942
- Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower.
- In the face of the enemy...

1144
01:46:03.319 --> 01:46:06.780
- Let the enemy have no power over her.
- Son of Iniquity be powerless to harm her.

1145
01:46:06.948 --> 01:46:10.784
<i>Your mother sucks cocks in hell, Karras.
You faithless slime.</i>

1146
01:46:10.952 --> 01:46:11.993
The Lord be with you.

1147
01:46:12.161 --> 01:46:14.162
- And also with you.
- Let us pray.

1148
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:15.664
Holy Lord, almighty Father...

1149
01:46:16.999 --> 01:46:18.041
...everlasting God...

1150
01:46:18.209 --> 01:46:20.753
...and Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ...

1151
01:46:20.921 --> 01:46:24.799
...who, once and for all, consigned
that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell...

1152
01:46:24.967 --> 01:46:29.512
...who sent your only begotten son into
the world to crush that roaring lion...

1153
01:46:30.139 --> 01:46:32.014
...hasten to our call for help...

1154
01:46:32.182 --> 01:46:37.061
...and snatch from ruination and
from the clutches of the noonday devil...

1155
01:46:37.229 --> 01:46:41.441
...this human being,
made in your image and likeness.

1156
01:46:41.608 --> 01:46:46.612
Strike terror, Lord, into the beast
now laying waste to your vineyard.

1157
01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:51.576
Let your mighty hand cast him out
of your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil...

1158
01:46:52.995 --> 01:46:55.955
...so he may no longer hold captive
this person...

1159
01:46:56.165 --> 01:46:58.708
...whom it pleased you to make
in your image...

1160
01:46:58.876 --> 01:46:59.876
Aah!

1161
01:47:00.043 --> 01:47:03.755
...and to redeem through your son,
who lives and reigns with you...

1162
01:47:03.965 --> 01:47:08.385
...in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.

1163
01:47:08.887 --> 01:47:10.929
- Amen.
- O Lord, hear my prayer.

1164
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:15.434
Father Karras.

1165
01:47:17.812 --> 01:47:19.563
Father Karras.

1166
01:47:21.357 --> 01:47:24.902
Damien. The response, please, Damien!

1167
01:47:25.737 --> 01:47:28.071
And let my cry come unto thee.

1168
01:47:28.239 --> 01:47:32.284
Almighty Lord, word of God the Father,
Jesus Christ...

1169
01:47:32.452 --> 01:47:34.912
...God and Lord of all creation...

1170
01:47:36.289 --> 01:47:38.009
...who gave to your holy apostles...

1171
01:47:38.166 --> 01:47:41.251
...the power to tramp underfoot
serpents and scorpions.

1172
01:47:41.419 --> 01:47:43.338
Grant me...

1173
01:47:43.506 --> 01:47:45.256
...your unworthy servant...

1174
01:47:45.424 --> 01:47:47.300
- ...pardon for all my sins...
- Bastards!

1175
01:47:47.468 --> 01:47:52.096
...and the power to confront
this cruel demon.

1176
01:48:08.781 --> 01:48:13.159
See the cross of the Lord.
Be gone, you hostile power.

1177
01:48:13.369 --> 01:48:16.287
- O Lord, hear my prayer.
- And let my cry come unto thee.

1178
01:48:16.622 --> 01:48:19.457
- The Lord be with you.
- And also with you.

1179
01:48:49.948 --> 01:48:51.323
Father.

1180
01:49:13.264 --> 01:49:16.516
I cast you out, unclean spirit!

1181
01:49:16.684 --> 01:49:19.811
<i>- Shove it up your ass, you faggot!</i>
- In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ!

1182
01:49:21.981 --> 01:49:24.149
It is he who commands you!

1183
01:49:24.358 --> 01:49:27.777
He who flung you straight from heaven
to the depths of hell!

1184
01:49:27.987 --> 01:49:29.237
<i>- Fuck him!</i>
- Be gone...

1185
01:49:29.405 --> 01:49:32.365
<i>- Fuck him, Karras!</i>
- ...from this creature of God.

1186
01:49:35.202 --> 01:49:36.411
Be gone!

1187
01:49:36.579 --> 01:49:40.707
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

1188
01:49:40.875 --> 01:49:42.709
...and the Holy Spirit.

1189
01:49:42.877 --> 01:49:47.340
By this sign of the Holy Cross,
of our Lord Jesus Christ...

1190
01:49:47.507 --> 01:49:51.594
...who lives and reigns with the Father
and the Holy Spirit.

1191
01:49:53.305 --> 01:49:54.680
Damien!

1192
01:49:55.349 --> 01:49:56.474
Amen.

1193
01:49:56.683 --> 01:49:59.727
God, defender of the human race...

1194
01:50:01.938 --> 01:50:03.230
...look down in pity...

1195
01:50:03.398 --> 01:50:06.400
<i>You killed your mother!
You left her alone to die!</i>

1196
01:50:06.568 --> 01:50:08.694
- Shut up!
<i>- She'll never forgive you!</i>

1197
01:50:08.862 --> 01:50:10.988
- Shut up!
- Bastard!

1198
01:50:12.574 --> 01:50:14.116
I command you...

1199
01:50:14.534 --> 01:50:17.328
...by the judge of the living
and the dead...

1200
01:50:17.496 --> 01:50:21.082
...to depart from this servant of God.

1201
01:50:23.752 --> 01:50:26.045
It's the power... Holy water.

1202
01:50:30.843 --> 01:50:34.346
It's the power of Christ that compels you.

1203
01:50:34.806 --> 01:50:42.806
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1204
01:51:21.979 --> 01:51:25.356
- The power of Christ compels you.
- The power of Christ compels you.

1205
01:51:25.524 --> 01:51:28.860
He brought you low
by his blood-stained cross!

1206
01:51:29.027 --> 01:51:32.655
Do not despise my command,
because you know me to be a sinner.

1207
01:51:36.952 --> 01:51:40.163
It is God himself who commands you.

1208
01:51:43.125 --> 01:51:46.627
The majestic Christ who commands you.

1209
01:51:47.921 --> 01:51:49.839
God, the Father, commands you.

1210
01:51:53.261 --> 01:51:55.596
God, the Son, commands you.

1211
01:51:59.476 --> 01:52:02.227
God, the Holy Spirit, commands you.

1212
01:52:02.395 --> 01:52:04.563
The mystery of the cross commands you.

1213
01:52:04.731 --> 01:52:07.566
The blood of the martyrs commands you.

1214
01:52:27.712 --> 01:52:31.716
Give way to Christ, you
prince of murderers.

1215
01:52:33.010 --> 01:52:36.346
You're guilty before almighty God.

1216
01:52:36.972 --> 01:52:39.474
Guilty before his son.

1217
01:52:39.642 --> 01:52:42.727
Guilty before the whole human race.

1218
01:52:43.062 --> 01:52:45.396
It is the Lord who expels you...

1219
01:52:45.564 --> 01:52:51.152
...he who is coming to judge both the
living and the dead and the world, by fire.

1220
01:53:13.176 --> 01:53:14.760
Are you tired?

1221
01:53:22.185 --> 01:53:24.979
Let's rest before we start again.

1222
01:54:00.224 --> 01:54:03.977
Why this girl? It doesn't make sense.

1223
01:54:12.486 --> 01:54:15.614
I think the point is to make us despair.

1224
01:54:18.659 --> 01:54:20.827
To see ourselves as...

1225
01:54:22.330 --> 01:54:24.581
...animal and ugly.

1226
01:54:27.919 --> 01:54:31.922
To reject the possibility that God
could love us.

1227
01:54:39.473 --> 01:54:41.807
Will you excuse me, Damien?

1228
01:55:33.736 --> 01:55:38.073
Why? Why?

1229
01:55:39.742 --> 01:55:43.704
No. No.

1230
01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:12.817
<i>Dimmy, why you do this to me?</i>

1231
01:56:15.279 --> 01:56:18.740
<i>Please, Dimmy. I'm afraid.</i>

1232
01:56:20.284 --> 01:56:22.368
You're not my mother.

1233
01:56:23.328 --> 01:56:25.538
<i>Dimmy, please!</i>

1234
01:56:38.635 --> 01:56:40.304
What is it?

1235
01:56:45.351 --> 01:56:46.435
Her heart.

1236
01:56:46.978 --> 01:56:48.854
Can you give her something?

1237
01:56:49.022 --> 01:56:50.856
She'll go into a coma.

1238
01:56:54.819 --> 01:56:56.987
You're not my mother!

1239
01:56:57.155 --> 01:56:58.155
Don't listen.

1240
01:56:58.323 --> 01:56:59.948
<i>Why, Dimmy?</i>

1241
01:57:00.909 --> 01:57:02.242
Damien.

1242
01:57:02.410 --> 01:57:03.660
<i>- Dimmy, please.</i>
- Damien.

1243
01:57:08.083 --> 01:57:09.833
Get out.

1244
01:59:03.159 --> 01:59:07.370
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

1245
01:59:22.929 --> 01:59:24.764
Is it over?

1246
01:59:25.307 --> 01:59:26.891
Mm-mm.

1247
01:59:34.816 --> 01:59:36.609
Is she gonna die?

1248
01:59:41.949 --> 01:59:43.324
No.

1249
02:01:01.238 --> 02:01:03.197
You son of a bitch!

1250
02:01:09.163 --> 02:01:11.080
Take me.

1251
02:01:11.248 --> 02:01:12.540
Come into me.

1252
02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:15.752
Goddamn you, take me!

1253
02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:18.046
Take me!

1254
02:01:31.269 --> 02:01:32.728
No!

1255
02:01:42.322 --> 02:01:43.364
Mother.

1256
02:01:46.368 --> 02:01:48.118
Mother.

1257
02:01:53.583 --> 02:01:56.418
Mother.

1258
02:01:59.089 --> 02:02:00.297
Did somebody fall?

1259
02:02:00.465 --> 02:02:01.924
- The steps!
- Help!

1260
02:02:02.092 --> 02:02:03.801
Mother!

1261
02:02:05.678 --> 02:02:06.720
Mother!

1262
02:02:08.556 --> 02:02:09.599
Rags?

1263
02:02:30.996 --> 02:02:33.415
Do you want to make your confession?

1264
02:02:39.296 --> 02:02:41.339
Are you sorry for...?

1265
02:02:41.507 --> 02:02:46.136
Are you sorry for having offended God
and for all the sins of your past life?

1266
02:02:52.602 --> 02:02:54.739
<i>"Ego te absolvo in
nomine Patris..."</i>

1267
02:02:56.090 --> 02:03:00.132
<i>"...nomine Patris et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen."</i>

1268
02:03:15.333 --> 02:03:16.750
- Where do you want this?
- What?

1269
02:03:16.918 --> 02:03:18.169
Phonograph.

1270
02:03:18.336 --> 02:03:19.545
Storage.

1271
02:03:29.055 --> 02:03:30.473
That's everything.

1272
02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:34.269
I'm gonna miss you.

1273
02:03:34.437 --> 02:03:35.812
Same here.

1274
02:03:36.355 --> 02:03:38.023
Sure you won't change your mind?

1275
02:03:53.873 --> 02:03:56.416
I found this in her room.

1276
02:04:01.088 --> 02:04:02.923
You better hurry.

1277
02:04:12.683 --> 02:04:14.519
Come on, honey, we have to get going.

1278
02:04:38.585 --> 02:04:40.378
She doesn't remember any of it.

1279
02:04:40.963 --> 02:04:42.630
That's good.

1280
02:04:46.468 --> 02:04:48.052
- All done.
- Okay.

1281
02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:49.762
Honey, this is Father Dyer.

1282
02:04:49.930 --> 02:04:52.139
- Hi, Father.
- Hello.

1283
02:04:53.016 --> 02:04:54.100
Ready, missus.

1284
02:04:56.062 --> 02:04:57.479
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.

1285
02:04:57.647 --> 02:04:59.064
I'll call you.

1286
02:05:19.877 --> 02:05:21.461
Bye.

1287
02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:27.551
- Bye, Father.
- I hope I see you again.

1288
02:05:27.719 --> 02:05:29.219
I hope so too.

1289
02:05:29.804 --> 02:05:31.680
Father Dyer?

1290
02:05:36.353 --> 02:05:38.855
I thought you'd like to keep this.

1291
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:49.574
Why don't you keep it?

1292
02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:55.391
Lieutenant.

1293
02:06:56.434 --> 02:06:57.935
You just missed them.

1294
02:07:01.232 --> 02:07:02.732
How's the girl?

1295
02:07:03.651 --> 02:07:05.276
She seemed fine.

1296
02:07:05.986 --> 02:07:11.324
That's important.

1297
02:07:12.451 --> 02:07:14.577
Well, well...

1298
02:07:14.745 --> 02:07:17.122
...back to business, back to work.

1299
02:07:17.832 --> 02:07:20.500
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.

1300
02:07:25.214 --> 02:07:26.464
Father Dyer...

1301
02:07:28.634 --> 02:07:30.427
...do you go to films?

1302
02:07:30.594 --> 02:07:31.636
Sure.

1303
02:07:31.929 --> 02:07:35.014
Well, I got passes.

1304
02:07:35.182 --> 02:07:37.517
In fact, I got a pass to the Crest
tomorrow night.

1305
02:07:37.685 --> 02:07:38.810
Would you like to go?

1306
02:07:38.978 --> 02:07:41.731
- What's playing?
- Wuthering Heights.

1307
02:07:41.898 --> 02:07:43.399
Who's in it?

1308
02:07:44.192 --> 02:07:50.281
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role
of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.

1309
02:07:51.783 --> 02:07:53.325
I've seen it.

1310
02:07:57.706 --> 02:07:59.165
Another one.

1311
02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.501
- Had your lunch?
- No.
