00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:04.172
(ominous music)

2
00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:29.763
(TV static crackles)

3
00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.403
(Melissa pants)

4
00:00:35.403 --> 00:00:36.670
- No!

5
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.638
I need help!

6
00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:40.274
No!

7
00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:46.214
(Melissa pants)

8
00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:56.957
(Melissa grunts)

9
00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:01.061
(Melissa screams)

10
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.167
Come on.

11
00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:09.570
(Melissa yelps and grunts)

12
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.972
(Melissa grunts)

13
00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:14.708
(Melissa groans)

14
00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.812
(ominous music continues)

15
00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:23.384
(Melissa pants and whimpers)

16
00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:25.653
- [Demon] You can't escape.

17
00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:29.957
(bangs on door)
(Melissa sobs)

18
00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:31.559
Don't forget.

19
00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:32.660
I'm watching.

20
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.867
(Melissa grunts)

21
00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:42.736
I need you.

22
00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.207
- Leave me alone!

23
00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:49.743
You can't stop me!

24
00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:50.544
You can't!

25
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.149
- [Demon] There's
only one way out.

26
00:01:57.718 --> 00:01:59.353
- Leave me alone!

27
00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:01.355
- [Demon] And you know

28
00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:02.190
what

29
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.891
that

30
00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:05.793
is.

31
00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:10.030
(Melissa pants)

32
00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:18.138
(ominous music continues)

33
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.208
- No, no! Leave me alone!

34
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.444
Leave me alone!

35
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:28.616
No!

36
00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:32.686
Please!

37
00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:35.456
No.

38
00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:38.859
(Melissa sobs)

39
00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.761
(Melissa screams)

40
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:41.595
No!

41
00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:45.098
No, no.

42
00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:47.401
(screams) No!

43
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:48.736
No, no!

44
00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:51.439
(Melissa screams)

45
00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.375
Help me! (screams)

46
00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:57.110
(train whooshes)

47
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.923
- Hi, Margaret.
- Good morning, Lily.

48
00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.692
Are you safely there yet?
- Yeah, I'll be there soon.

49
00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:13.193
I'm on my way to the hotel now.

50
00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.396
- [Margaret] Hope you've had
a relaxing train journey.

51
00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:16.997
- Well, no. Not really.

52
00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:19.833
There was a family in the
quiet coach with a noisy baby.

53
00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:22.436
- [Margaret] Oh, don't you
just hate those people?

54
00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:24.938
They think they're more
important than anyone,

55
00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:27.675
just because they have a child.

56
00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:29.977
- Yeah.
- Anyway, keep me posted.

57
00:03:38.486 --> 00:03:41.455
- Oh, hi. The Imperial
Hotel, please.

58
00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:51.064
(dark orchestral music)

59
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:32.873
(door creaks)

60
00:04:49.523 --> 00:04:52.526
(eerie piano music)

61
00:04:56.364 --> 00:04:58.031
(Lily clears her throat)

62
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.501
- I'm afraid you're a
little early for checking.

63
00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:01.669
- Oh, no. I'm not checking in.

64
00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:02.503
I'm Lily.

65
00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:05.673
The new night manager.

66
00:05:14.882 --> 00:05:16.316
- Excuse me.

67
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:20.988
I was expecting someone
a little less ordinary?

68
00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:23.491
Let me take that.

69
00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.327
Thank you. I'll show
you to your room.

70
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.630
This is the ground floor.

71
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.698
- Yeah, makes sense.

72
00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.667
- If you didn't already
know, the first seven floors

73
00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:37.270
are the hotel proper, and
the other seven floors

74
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.241
are for, let's say,
the less savory people.

75
00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:48.882
(elevator squeaks)

76
00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:54.021
- The infamous lift.

77
00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:57.290
- So, you heard about
the events, then?

78
00:05:58.726 --> 00:06:00.127
- Yeah. Of course.

79
00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:04.465
- You do wonder why
a bright young girl

80
00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:06.166
would choose to
take her own life.

81
00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.604
- You think it was suicide?

82
00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:12.072
- Of course.

83
00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.508
You don't believe all
these conspiracy theories?

84
00:06:15.743 --> 00:06:17.745
There's a lot of tall
tales about this place,

85
00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:19.212
and what happened to Melissa.

86
00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.850
Believe me. I've heard them all.

87
00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:28.689
I can assure you, they've just
been exaggerated by the press

88
00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.824
to get a good story.

89
00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.564
(elevator doors squeak)

90
00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:47.741
So, here's your room. You
should have everything you need.

91
00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:52.713
And your uniform's
in the cupboard.

92
00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:55.148
I do hope it fits.

93
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.686
So, where have you come from?

94
00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:01.254
- Oh. Just from near Manchester.

95
00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.089
- Ah.

96
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.658
Bit of a change of scene, then.

97
00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:07.761
Soon think you'll
make the place a home.

98
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.997
Let me show you around
the rest of the place.

99
00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:15.836
(dark orchestral music)

100
00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:20.073
(muffled moans and
rhythmic thuds)

101
00:07:24.712 --> 00:07:28.982
(muffled moans and
rhythmic thuds)

102
00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:39.192
It can get rather
lively up here.

103
00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:47.968
- [Woman] Fuck off.

104
00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:49.069
- Ah, Hank.

105
00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:54.608
I'd like you to meet Lily.
She's our new night manager.

106
00:07:57.711 --> 00:07:59.312
- Pleasure to meet you, darling.

107
00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.156
- Nice to meet you.

108
00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:14.962
- Now, Hank's one of our
longest serving tenants.

109
00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:17.598
- Oh, I just love it here.

110
00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:21.001
I'm sure you'll have
a hell of a time, too.

111
00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:23.436
- I'm sure I will.

112
00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:25.438
- See you soon, then.

113
00:08:28.876 --> 00:08:30.878
- He's all right, Hank.

114
00:08:30.878 --> 00:08:34.014
Most of the folks up here
keep themselves to themselves

115
00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.316
and you won't need to
come up here very often.

116
00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:43.090
Now, this is the boiler room
where the water tanks are kept.

117
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.996
The door's usually locked.
Well, it should be.

118
00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.698
Only Norton has the key.

119
00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:53.533
- [Lily] Norton?

120
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.902
- Norton.

121
00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:59.472
A handyman, slash
caretaker, security.

122
00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:00.941
Keeps this place running.

123
00:09:00.941 --> 00:09:02.710
He's pretty much
part of the hotel.

124
00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:06.379
You'll meet him soon.

125
00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:07.314
He'll be around.

126
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:12.285
(dark orchestral music)

127
00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.326
Ah, Norton. Right on cue.

128
00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:22.462
This is our new
night manager, Lily.

129
00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:27.167
I'm sure you'll be seeing
rather a bit of each other.

130
00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:32.172
(footsteps clack)
(dark orchestral music)

131
00:09:32.773 --> 00:09:33.373
- Pleasure.

132
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:38.846
- Hi.

133
00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:45.285
- Uh, everything's ship shape?

134
00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:46.854
Did to you get that leak fixed?

135
00:09:48.822 --> 00:09:50.023
- Yes.

136
00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:51.491
It's all good.

137
00:09:51.491 --> 00:09:52.325
- Great work.

138
00:09:56.664 --> 00:09:58.766
- Well, I'll be seeing you.

139
00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:07.540
(Norton whistles cheerfully)

140
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.943
- Doesn't like to stay and chat.

141
00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:13.446
He's been here for ages.

142
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:17.417
Knows all the tenants,
and the hotel quirks.

143
00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:26.226
- Good to know.

144
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.864
(gentle orchestral music)

145
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:17.377
(water splashes)

146
00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:22.682
(faucet squeaks)

147
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:25.418
(water trickles)

148
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:34.061
(water trickles)

149
00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:43.503
(suspenseful orchestral music)

150
00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:58.451
(ominous tones)

151
00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:14.267
- Good evening.

152
00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:16.236
- Good evening.

153
00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:18.906
- Feeling refreshed?

154
00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:24.444
- Yeah. Raring to go.

155
00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:27.014
- Very good. Well, there's
not much to it, really.

156
00:12:27.014 --> 00:12:29.216
Everyone books
online, these days.

157
00:12:29.216 --> 00:12:31.551
Check them in, check them out.

158
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.755
I have left you a
list of tasks on here.

159
00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.291
I'll pop it under the counter.

160
00:12:40.527 --> 00:12:42.930
Should be all quite
familiar to you.

161
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.332
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

162
00:12:45.332 --> 00:12:47.700
- As you know, it's
still the off season,

163
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.269
and so not many hotel bookings.

164
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:54.241
We do have our long-term
residents and their friends.

165
00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:56.676
They keep themselves
to themselves.

166
00:12:56.676 --> 00:12:58.478
If you do have any
trouble, however,

167
00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:01.081
my weapon of choice
is a baseball bat

168
00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:02.782
that I keep under here.

169
00:13:11.024 --> 00:13:13.026
Righto.

170
00:13:13.026 --> 00:13:18.031
See you at 7AM.

171
00:13:26.173 --> 00:13:28.608
(Lily sighs)

172
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.821
(TV static hisses)

173
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.156
- Come on, Melissa.

174
00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:46.259
Tell me what you were doing.

175
00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.499
Are you running away from
something, or someone?

176
00:14:04.912 --> 00:14:06.546
(bell dings)
(gasps) Jesus!

177
00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:10.250
- Oh, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to scare you.

178
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.152
- (sighs) It's okay.

179
00:14:12.152 --> 00:14:14.154
- You're watching the
video, aren't you?

180
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.396
Yeah, I've watched it
about a million times.

181
00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:25.498
Never stops being creepy.

182
00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:27.100
- Yeah. You're right about that.

183
00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.370
What do you think she was doing?

184
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:32.472
- Personally?

185
00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:36.109
I think she was orbiting Saturn.

186
00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:38.711
- Why did she stop
taking her meds?

187
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:40.981
- Perhaps she took
them all at once.

188
00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:43.383
Would explain how she
ended up drowning herself.

189
00:14:44.584 --> 00:14:47.420
- Hm.

190
00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.990
- Anyway, I just came
along to make sure

191
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.191
that you're all settled.

192
00:14:52.592 --> 00:14:56.096
If there's anything I can get
for you, just say my name.

193
00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:58.731
- Will do.

194
00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:09.342
(Norton whistles cheerfully)

195
00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:16.316
(button clicks)

196
00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:19.252
(elevator squeaks)

197
00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:26.893
(Lily breathes heavily)
(suspenseful orchestral music)

198
00:15:27.494 --> 00:15:29.729
(button clicks)

199
00:15:30.897 --> 00:15:34.734
(elevator doors
squeak and clack)

200
00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:37.104
Six.

201
00:15:37.104 --> 00:15:38.371
Two.

202
00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:41.274
(intense orchestral music)

203
00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:43.876
(Melissa screams)

204
00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:46.713
(Melissa screams)

205
00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:57.057
(birds chirp)
(dark orchestral music)

206
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.892
(keyboard clacks)

207
00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:15.708
(keyboard clacks)

208
00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:25.752
(keyboard clacks)

209
00:16:53.613 --> 00:16:58.618
(dark music)
(chanting in foreign language)

210
00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:11.431
(knife hacks)
(woman screams)

211
00:17:11.431 --> 00:17:14.101
(static hisses)

212
00:17:20.507 --> 00:17:23.976
- So, here we finally are.
The infamous Imperial Hotel.

213
00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.712
How you feeling, Zak?
- I'm so pumped, man.

214
00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.347
But I've gotta be
honest with you, bro.

215
00:17:27.347 --> 00:17:28.715
I'm a little bit nervous.
- For real, dude.

216
00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.217
It's kinda like the
Paris Catacombs.

217
00:17:30.217 --> 00:17:31.884
It feels totally creepy already.

218
00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:33.586
- Yeah. Totally, man.

219
00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:35.955
Hey. How are you doing?

220
00:17:35.955 --> 00:17:38.658
- Hi. Welcome to
the Imperial Hotel.

221
00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:40.427
- Oh. Cool accent.

222
00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:42.862
- Thanks.
- Hey, I'm Zak.

223
00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:43.963
And this, this is Gabe.

224
00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:44.797
- Yo.

225
00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:48.034
- Uh, hi. Um, please
don't do that.

226
00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:52.205
- Hey, sorry. We're
just excited to be here.

227
00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:54.274
- Mm, sure you are. Did
you fly in today, then?

228
00:17:54.274 --> 00:17:56.042
- Yeah. It was a long journey.

229
00:17:56.042 --> 00:17:58.311
I can't believe it's
dark here already.

230
00:17:58.311 --> 00:18:00.380
- Yeah. It's not the only
thing weird here, man.

231
00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:03.350
- Anyway, your room's ready.

232
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.817
- Oh, is there a room
on the 14th floor?

233
00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:07.019
Can we have one on 14th?

234
00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:10.190
- Oh, I'm sorry. There's no
rooms available on that floor.

235
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.658
The seventh floor is
actually the highest

236
00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:13.226
hotel guests are allowed to go.

237
00:18:14.627 --> 00:18:15.995
- Bummer.

238
00:18:15.995 --> 00:18:17.230
- Here are your keys.

239
00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:20.066
The elevators are just
straight through those doors,

240
00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:22.969
and then, well, it's
signed from there.

241
00:18:22.969 --> 00:18:24.237
- Oh, sweet. Thanks.

242
00:18:24.237 --> 00:18:25.772
- Laters. Off we go.

243
00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.974
(both chuckle)

244
00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:31.311
(dark orchestral music)

245
00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:34.414
All right. So, we're finally
off to play the elevator game.

246
00:18:34.414 --> 00:18:36.616
Took about a bottle of
vodka to get his courage?

247
00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.285
How you feeling, bro?

248
00:18:38.285 --> 00:18:40.086
- Shit-scared, man.
- Don't worry, it'll be fine.

249
00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:42.622
Just don't talk to
the woman on fifth.

250
00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:44.157
- I'll try.

251
00:18:44.157 --> 00:18:47.093
- That'll be the first time
Zak's not talked to a woman.

252
00:18:47.093 --> 00:18:49.596
Okay, everyone. Jokes aside,
this is getting serious now.

253
00:18:49.596 --> 00:18:51.664
The elevator's coming and
Zak's gonna play the game

254
00:18:51.664 --> 00:18:54.534
in this very old, creepy hotel.

255
00:18:54.534 --> 00:18:55.902
The Imperial Hotel.

256
00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.571
Oh, shit. The
elevator's here, man.

257
00:18:58.571 --> 00:18:59.806
This is where I leave you.

258
00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:01.040
Look, you have to
play the game alone,

259
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.142
but I'll be right
here on seven, bro.

260
00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:03.976
- All right. All right.

261
00:19:07.013 --> 00:19:09.316
- Just remember the rules,
dude. Think positive.

262
00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:10.750
All right. This is
gonna be awesome, man.

263
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.151
It's gonna be game changing.

264
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:13.152
Don't be afraid.

265
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:15.121
- All right. Let's do it.

266
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:18.458
(elevator doors squeak)

267
00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:27.267
This is Zak Epstein about
to play the elevator game

268
00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:30.303
in the infamous Imperial Hotel.

269
00:19:30.303 --> 00:19:31.170
Wish me luck.

270
00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:34.641
(button clicks)

271
00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:36.643
(suspenseful music)

272
00:19:36.643 --> 00:19:38.478
(elevator clacks)

273
00:19:38.478 --> 00:19:41.180
Okay. We're going down
to the ground floor now.

274
00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:43.683
And then...

275
00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:44.917
Then it starts.

276
00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:49.722
(elevator creaks)

277
00:19:58.097 --> 00:19:59.499
- Oh, you're not.

278
00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:03.670
(elevator doors squeak)

279
00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:12.044
(suspenseful music continues)

280
00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:15.382
- Okay.

281
00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:16.215
One down.

282
00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:40.407
(Lily sighs)

283
00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:41.841
Okay.

284
00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:45.445
Now we're on the
10th and we all know,

285
00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:46.813
we all know what comes next.

286
00:20:47.814 --> 00:20:48.615
It's...

287
00:20:50.317 --> 00:20:52.018
It's the fifth floor.

288
00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:59.191
(elevator doors squeak)

289
00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:02.929
(suspenseful music continues)

290
00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:08.835
Well, no sign of a woman yet.

291
00:21:09.802 --> 00:21:11.338
Thank God.

292
00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:14.206
(phone rings)

293
00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:17.444
(phone rings)

294
00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:20.146
(phone rings)

295
00:21:20.146 --> 00:21:21.981
- [Lily] For God sake.

296
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.317
(phone rings)

297
00:21:24.317 --> 00:21:27.654
(elevator doors squeak)

298
00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:32.959
(suspenseful music continues)

299
00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:14.033
Is this another realm,
or is this floor seven?

300
00:22:16.202 --> 00:22:17.537
No, it can't be.

301
00:22:21.774 --> 00:22:25.177
Guys, I think I'm
here. I think I'm here.

302
00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:34.186
Gabe.

303
00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:38.124
Gabe.

304
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.731
(floorboards creak)

305
00:22:44.731 --> 00:22:48.000
(Zak breathes heavily)

306
00:22:50.336 --> 00:22:54.140
(suspenseful music continues)

307
00:22:55.575 --> 00:22:56.976
Guys, look at this place.

308
00:22:57.877 --> 00:22:58.978
Look at this place.

309
00:23:00.547 --> 00:23:04.083
(ominous orchestral music)

310
00:23:13.092 --> 00:23:18.097
What the...

311
00:23:23.803 --> 00:23:27.206
(tense orchestral music)

312
00:23:42.188 --> 00:23:43.322
- Something's happened.

313
00:23:44.724 --> 00:23:45.725
- What?

314
00:23:45.725 --> 00:23:47.560
- It's not pleasant.

315
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.361
I really don't think
you should see.

316
00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.866
(dark orchestral music)

317
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:57.269
(keys rattle)

318
00:24:07.013 --> 00:24:08.014
- Norton sent me in.

319
00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:12.752
(rope creaks)
(Lily pants)

320
00:24:12.752 --> 00:24:13.586
- Yeah.

321
00:24:14.521 --> 00:24:16.355
I thought he may
have warned you.

322
00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:19.291
(Lily retches)

323
00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.894
Looks like the other idiot
jumped out of the window.

324
00:24:24.497 --> 00:24:26.465
(sighs) Look.

325
00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:28.868
We don't need you here. You
go to bed, get some rest.

326
00:24:28.868 --> 00:24:31.103
I'll get Norton to
deal with this mess.

327
00:24:31.103 --> 00:24:33.272
(rope creaks)

328
00:24:33.272 --> 00:24:34.106
Come on.

329
00:24:35.041 --> 00:24:38.377
(Lily breathes sharply)

330
00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:42.682
(rope creaks)

331
00:24:43.916 --> 00:24:48.788
(thunder claps)
(rain patters)

332
00:24:48.788 --> 00:24:51.457
(Lily whimpers)

333
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:02.769
(water drips)
(muffled thunder rumbles)

334
00:25:09.809 --> 00:25:12.311
(water drips)

335
00:25:24.256 --> 00:25:26.759
(water drips)

336
00:25:29.095 --> 00:25:30.296
- I'm sorry I'm late.

337
00:25:30.296 --> 00:25:32.765
- It's okay. Just don't
make a habit of it.

338
00:25:32.765 --> 00:25:34.200
- No, I won't. I'm sorry.

339
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.668
- No incoming tonight.

340
00:25:35.668 --> 00:25:38.404
309 canceled.

341
00:25:38.404 --> 00:25:42.842
They do not get a refund,
if they try on with you.

342
00:25:42.842 --> 00:25:43.676
- Okay.

343
00:25:44.611 --> 00:25:47.714
- Oh, and if anyone asks,

344
00:25:47.714 --> 00:25:49.616
they're suicides,

345
00:25:49.616 --> 00:25:54.320
and you don't know
anything else about it.

346
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.657
(dark orchestral music)

347
00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:22.081
(keys rattle)

348
00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:26.819
(keys rattle)

349
00:26:34.861 --> 00:26:35.862
(keys rattle)

350
00:26:35.862 --> 00:26:38.865
(eerie piano music)

351
00:26:45.104 --> 00:26:48.207
(phone camera snaps)

352
00:26:51.043 --> 00:26:54.146
(phone camera snaps)

353
00:26:57.016 --> 00:27:00.853
(suspenseful orchestral music)

354
00:27:04.991 --> 00:27:08.294
(ominous orchestral music)

355
00:27:08.294 --> 00:27:10.797
(rope creaks)

356
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.169
(phone camera snaps)

357
00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:32.084
(phone camera snaps)

358
00:27:36.355 --> 00:27:38.858
(rope creaks)

359
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.873
(flies buzz)

360
00:28:06.753 --> 00:28:09.822
(phone camera snaps)

361
00:28:21.167 --> 00:28:24.536
(phone camera snaps)

362
00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:27.639
(phone camera snaps)

363
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.883
(phone camera snaps)

364
00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:41.153
- You're the new
girl, aren't ya?

365
00:28:43.122 --> 00:28:44.223
- Yeah. I am.

366
00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:47.259
- Seth.

367
00:28:47.259 --> 00:28:49.495
Although, my mother
claimed it's Set,

368
00:28:49.495 --> 00:28:52.731
like the Egyptian God of Chaos.

369
00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:58.404
Spelled the same way, but
people find that confusing.

370
00:28:58.404 --> 00:29:00.907
So, everyone calls me Seth.

371
00:29:02.141 --> 00:29:02.975
- Hi.

372
00:29:04.176 --> 00:29:05.144
Lovely to meet you.

373
00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:07.413
Seth.

374
00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:13.052
- Good to have a female
touch round here.

375
00:29:14.386 --> 00:29:17.056
Place is looking a bit run down.

376
00:29:20.326 --> 00:29:23.729
- Hm. I'm not here to
give it a makeover.

377
00:29:26.565 --> 00:29:30.970
You do know there's a
bathroom for stuff like that?

378
00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.172
- Oh, I'm sorry. I just, uh...

379
00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:36.708
Tryin' to stop
them from rotting.

380
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.246
I haven't got anything
stuck in them, have I?

381
00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:43.515
- No. You're fine.

382
00:29:48.487 --> 00:29:49.321
Hey.

383
00:29:50.489 --> 00:29:52.258
Do you know anything
about those backpackers?

384
00:29:52.258 --> 00:29:55.661
You know, the ones who, uh-
- Killed themselves?

385
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:56.929
Serves them right.

386
00:29:56.929 --> 00:29:58.164
Coming in here,

387
00:29:58.164 --> 00:30:01.033
treating the place like
a tourist attraction.

388
00:30:01.934 --> 00:30:04.270
Taking their YouTube videos.

389
00:30:05.704 --> 00:30:09.575
Well, I don't know. Word
travels fast around here.

390
00:30:29.461 --> 00:30:30.997
(rain patters)

391
00:30:30.997 --> 00:30:34.333
(muffled thunder claps)

392
00:30:50.216 --> 00:30:52.684
(water drips)

393
00:31:03.562 --> 00:31:07.066
- I'd sleep much better,
if you were here.

394
00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:18.444
(phone rings and vibrates)

395
00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:23.882
(phone rings and vibrates)

396
00:31:27.853 --> 00:31:29.421
Hi.

397
00:31:29.421 --> 00:31:31.557
- [Margaret] I didn't
wake you, did I?

398
00:31:31.557 --> 00:31:33.993
- Oh, no. No.

399
00:31:33.993 --> 00:31:35.727
- [Margaret] Anyway,
those photos you sent.

400
00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:37.296
I can't see anything.

401
00:31:37.296 --> 00:31:39.898
They're all overexposed
and blurred.

402
00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.968
I thought you knew
how to use a camera.

403
00:31:45.604 --> 00:31:47.139
- They were fine,
when I sent them.

404
00:31:47.139 --> 00:31:48.540
- [Margaret] Well, try again!

405
00:31:49.508 --> 00:31:51.677
Maybe they got corrupted.

406
00:31:51.677 --> 00:31:53.679
Anyhow, must dash.

407
00:31:53.679 --> 00:31:55.081
Make sure you send them soon.

408
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.264
- [Norton] Evening.

409
00:32:12.264 --> 00:32:13.199
- Shit.

410
00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:17.003
Don't you ever knock?

411
00:32:18.304 --> 00:32:19.571
- This is my office, too.

412
00:32:25.011 --> 00:32:26.278
What photos are you looking at?

413
00:32:26.278 --> 00:32:28.480
- Mm. They didn't really
turn out very well.

414
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:31.783
Norton.

415
00:32:33.319 --> 00:32:35.287
What do you think of
backpacker deaths?

416
00:32:36.322 --> 00:32:37.923
Do you believe they're suicides?

417
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:42.028
- It is a bit
convenient, isn't it?

418
00:32:42.028 --> 00:32:43.762
- Well, yeah, and lazy.

419
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:47.533
- I don't think Vester wants
any attention on the hotel.

420
00:32:48.634 --> 00:32:50.136
Not after recent events.

421
00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:53.205
Probably paid them off.

422
00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.875
- But did you see
anything, or hear anything?

423
00:32:57.843 --> 00:33:00.446
I mean, did they annoy anyone?

424
00:33:01.547 --> 00:33:03.482
I can see how they
could piss someone off.

425
00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:05.484
- No one else.

426
00:33:08.554 --> 00:33:10.289
Maybe they thought that
it was a really cool way

427
00:33:10.289 --> 00:33:11.390
to sign out.

428
00:33:12.791 --> 00:33:16.428
You know, do it live from
the Imperial Hotel. Go viral.

429
00:33:16.428 --> 00:33:18.097
(Lily sighs)

430
00:33:18.097 --> 00:33:20.866
- Well, what would be the
point going viral, if they...

431
00:33:27.773 --> 00:33:28.674
Anyway.

432
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.645
Do you think you could
take a look in my room?

433
00:33:35.047 --> 00:33:37.483
There's a leak in my ceiling
and it's driving me mad.

434
00:33:37.483 --> 00:33:40.386
I'd be really grateful if
you could fix it for me.

435
00:33:40.386 --> 00:33:41.387
- Of course.

436
00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:50.028
(Norton whistles cheerfully)
(keys rattle)

437
00:34:32.671 --> 00:34:35.107
(Lily sighs)

438
00:34:36.475 --> 00:34:38.877
(fly buzzes)

439
00:34:47.186 --> 00:34:49.621
(fly buzzes)

440
00:34:50.789 --> 00:34:53.225
(Lily gasps)

441
00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:57.563
(Lily grunts)
(hand thuds)

442
00:34:57.563 --> 00:35:00.466
(fly buzzes)

443
00:35:00.466 --> 00:35:01.300
(Lily grunts)

444
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.536
(Lily pants)

445
00:35:04.536 --> 00:35:07.939
(Lily grunts)
(fly buzzes)

446
00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:09.775
(Lily grunts)

447
00:35:09.775 --> 00:35:14.780
(dark orchestral music)
(clock ticks rhythmically)

448
00:35:16.182 --> 00:35:19.017
(keyboard clacks)

449
00:35:24.323 --> 00:35:26.925
(clock chimes)

450
00:35:33.732 --> 00:35:37.303
(clock ticks rhythmically)

451
00:35:43.342 --> 00:35:46.578
(dark music continues)

452
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.817
(elevator doors squeak)

453
00:36:12.871 --> 00:36:16.408
(suspenseful music)

454
00:36:16.408 --> 00:36:17.909
- You can do this.

455
00:36:20.746 --> 00:36:22.448
You can do this.

456
00:36:22.448 --> 00:36:25.317
Just, just don't look at her.

457
00:36:25.317 --> 00:36:28.587
(Lily breathes deeply)

458
00:36:30.722 --> 00:36:32.057
You can do this.

459
00:36:33.825 --> 00:36:37.062
(Lily breathes deeply)

460
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:42.133
(elevator doors
squeak and clack)

461
00:36:46.171 --> 00:36:47.839
(elevator doors
squeak and clack)

462
00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:49.541
(gasps) Fuck me.

463
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:52.210
- Really? We're at work, Lilian.

464
00:36:53.345 --> 00:36:55.414
(Lily chuckles)

465
00:36:55.414 --> 00:36:57.349
Where have you been?

466
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:58.884
- Oh, just doing the tour.

467
00:36:58.884 --> 00:37:02.421
I was just checking to make
sure everything's in order.

468
00:37:02.421 --> 00:37:03.422
- And is it?

469
00:37:04.256 --> 00:37:05.457
- What?

470
00:37:05.457 --> 00:37:06.792
- Is everything in order?

471
00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:08.927
- Uh, yeah.

472
00:37:09.895 --> 00:37:11.363
Everything's, um, ship shape.

473
00:37:13.365 --> 00:37:14.199
- Good.

474
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.877
Wouldn't want to run a,
uh, messy hotel, would we?

475
00:37:27.045 --> 00:37:30.215
(elevator doors
squeak and clack)

476
00:37:30.215 --> 00:37:33.552
(dark orchestral music)

477
00:37:34.686 --> 00:37:37.989
(muffled woman screams)

478
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.065
(Lily gasps)

479
00:37:47.065 --> 00:37:48.734
- [Lily] What the...

480
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:52.904
- Morning.

481
00:37:52.904 --> 00:37:54.072
Shit.

482
00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:55.140
What happened to her?

483
00:37:59.645 --> 00:38:00.446
Fuck.

484
00:38:05.417 --> 00:38:07.419
- You did this to
her, didn't you?

485
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.055
Didn't you?

486
00:38:10.055 --> 00:38:11.757
- Hey! Whoa, whoa.

487
00:38:11.757 --> 00:38:13.158
I didn't touch her.

488
00:38:14.326 --> 00:38:16.294
I've never seen her
before in my life!

489
00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:19.164
- There's a complete
lie and you know it.

490
00:38:19.164 --> 00:38:20.399
You killed her.

491
00:38:22.701 --> 00:38:24.102
You're a monster.

492
00:38:25.804 --> 00:38:27.439
You're a maniac.

493
00:38:27.439 --> 00:38:32.010
(hand thuds)
(Lily screams)

494
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:32.844
- No.

495
00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:35.381
Are you okay?

496
00:38:42.921 --> 00:38:44.423
Get

497
00:38:44.423 --> 00:38:45.256
out

498
00:38:46.124 --> 00:38:46.958
now.

499
00:38:55.367 --> 00:38:56.868
- Are you okay?

500
00:38:56.868 --> 00:38:58.537
- Well, no, it's not
exactly how I thought

501
00:38:58.537 --> 00:39:00.739
my first week at work would go.

502
00:39:00.739 --> 00:39:04.109
- Well, I can assure
you, it does get easier.

503
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:08.213
- Seeing people being
brutally murdered gets easier?

504
00:39:08.213 --> 00:39:09.415
Good to know.

505
00:39:09.415 --> 00:39:11.316
- Well, I know it
wasn't exactly pretty,

506
00:39:11.316 --> 00:39:14.553
but don't let's jump
to conclusions that
they were murdered.

507
00:39:17.055 --> 00:39:18.056
- Did you see them?

508
00:39:19.224 --> 00:39:20.959
Did you see that girl?

509
00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.597
She was beaten black
and blue, and strangled.

510
00:39:25.597 --> 00:39:27.399
No one could do
that to themselves.

511
00:39:27.399 --> 00:39:29.067
- It's not impossible.

512
00:39:29.067 --> 00:39:32.838
I've heard there's talk of
autoerotic asphyxiation.

513
00:39:34.039 --> 00:39:36.775
- There's nothing
erotic about that.

514
00:39:36.775 --> 00:39:40.011
- We must maintain that
these were accidental deaths,

515
00:39:40.011 --> 00:39:41.980
or merely suicides.

516
00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.381
We can't have anything
like this getting out.

517
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:45.684
It would just be bad press.

518
00:39:45.684 --> 00:39:47.085
I insist.

519
00:39:50.489 --> 00:39:53.825
(dark orchestral music)

520
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:16.815
- Evening, Lilly.

521
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.919
I just wanted to
apologize for last night.

522
00:40:22.287 --> 00:40:23.555
I shouldn't have hit you.

523
00:40:24.956 --> 00:40:27.058
I can see why you might
think it was me that did it,

524
00:40:27.058 --> 00:40:29.227
but I swear on my
life, I didn't.

525
00:40:30.496 --> 00:40:31.463
I'd never hurt her.

526
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.832
- Well, you hurt me.

527
00:40:33.832 --> 00:40:35.433
- I'm sorry.

528
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:37.235
I really am.

529
00:40:37.235 --> 00:40:38.770
It was just a knee jerk reaction

530
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:40.238
to you thinking that I did it.

531
00:40:41.507 --> 00:40:42.841
Please.

532
00:40:42.841 --> 00:40:43.642
Forgive me.

533
00:40:45.677 --> 00:40:47.479
- All right.

534
00:40:47.479 --> 00:40:49.347
- I'm sure if you look closer,

535
00:40:49.347 --> 00:40:51.583
you'll figure out who
the real murderer is.

536
00:40:53.585 --> 00:40:54.886
I've gotta go.

537
00:40:54.886 --> 00:40:56.221
I'll catch you later.

538
00:41:05.997 --> 00:41:09.267
(dark music continues)

539
00:41:33.358 --> 00:41:35.193
- That creepy bastard.

540
00:41:37.028 --> 00:41:39.598
(keys rattle)

541
00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:47.873
(ominous music)

542
00:41:50.942 --> 00:41:53.912
(suspenseful music)

543
00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:15.567
What is that?

544
00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:19.197
- Well, Lily, you're keen today.

545
00:43:19.197 --> 00:43:21.299
- Yeah, I've been doing a
little digging on the murders.

546
00:43:21.299 --> 00:43:23.234
I went through the
CCTV footage earlier

547
00:43:23.234 --> 00:43:26.672
and I saw Seth follow
her into the elevator

548
00:43:26.672 --> 00:43:28.506
and then follow her
down the hallway,

549
00:43:29.675 --> 00:43:31.142
and then found dental
floss on the carpet

550
00:43:31.142 --> 00:43:32.477
and it had blood stains on.

551
00:43:32.477 --> 00:43:33.912
- So?

552
00:43:33.912 --> 00:43:36.081
- I put it in a separate
folder. Let me show you.

553
00:43:40.719 --> 00:43:42.153
- What am I looking at, here?

554
00:43:46.858 --> 00:43:48.193
- This can't be.

555
00:43:49.627 --> 00:43:51.162
Seth.

556
00:43:51.162 --> 00:43:51.997
- Where?

557
00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:57.502
- I saw him go into
the elevator. I swear!

558
00:43:57.502 --> 00:43:59.370
- Are you okay, Lily?

559
00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.439
I'm not sure you're
getting enough sleep.

560
00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.442
Maybe you need a
little bit more rest?

561
00:44:06.177 --> 00:44:08.246
By the way, I believe
this is yours.

562
00:44:10.115 --> 00:44:12.918
There you go. You never know
when you may need it again.

563
00:44:18.757 --> 00:44:22.193
(eerie orchestral music)

564
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.136
- [Margaret] So,
what have you got?

565
00:44:32.037 --> 00:44:33.872
Tell me something juicy.

566
00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:36.441
- Yesterday.

567
00:44:38.043 --> 00:44:39.177
Was it the day before?

568
00:44:41.346 --> 00:44:42.814
Anyway, a prostitute.

569
00:44:42.814 --> 00:44:44.783
She was beaten and strangled
with her own bra strap.

570
00:44:44.783 --> 00:44:45.884
- [Margaret] She died!

571
00:44:46.852 --> 00:44:48.353
Murdered?

572
00:44:48.353 --> 00:44:50.889
- Well, they're suggesting
autoerotic asphyxiation.

573
00:44:50.889 --> 00:44:53.424
- [Margaret] Oh, this is gold!

574
00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:54.926
- Compassionate, as always.

575
00:44:54.926 --> 00:44:57.428
- [Margaret] Isn't that how
someone else was killed,

576
00:44:57.428 --> 00:45:00.365
previously, by one of
the serial killers?

577
00:45:00.365 --> 00:45:01.599
- Yeah, in the '90s.

578
00:45:02.768 --> 00:45:04.535
- [Margaret] And how
about the boiler room,

579
00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:05.670
where Melissa died?

580
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.472
Have you been up there yet?

581
00:45:07.472 --> 00:45:09.775
- Where Melissa was
found, and no, not yet.

582
00:45:09.775 --> 00:45:12.978
I need the key.
So, I'll try later.

583
00:45:12.978 --> 00:45:14.379
- [Margaret] Good girl.

584
00:45:14.379 --> 00:45:15.847
I gotta go. My meeting's here.

585
00:45:15.847 --> 00:45:16.948
Keep up the good work!

586
00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:26.557
(dark music continues)
(clock ticks rhythmically)

587
00:45:29.494 --> 00:45:34.499
(footsteps clack)
(keys rattle)

588
00:45:36.101 --> 00:45:36.935
- Hey, Norton.

589
00:45:42.207 --> 00:45:43.041
- Yes?

590
00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:47.112
- Do you know why
there's no CCTV footage

591
00:45:47.112 --> 00:45:48.646
for the 14th floor?

592
00:45:48.646 --> 00:45:50.115
- Hm.

593
00:45:50.115 --> 00:45:51.682
Yeah, the camera on that
broke a couple of years ago

594
00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:53.184
and no one ever came
around to fix it.

595
00:45:53.184 --> 00:45:55.854
- Do you think you'd take
a look at it yourself?

596
00:45:55.854 --> 00:45:58.523
- I'm a plumber. I fix taps.

597
00:45:58.523 --> 00:46:00.025
I'm not an electrician.

598
00:46:00.025 --> 00:46:00.826
- Yeah.

599
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.496
Well, on that note, the leak
in my room has started again.

600
00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:08.033
- Okay. I'll go
take a look at it.

601
00:46:11.202 --> 00:46:14.372
- Do you think I could borrow
the key to the boiler room?

602
00:46:14.372 --> 00:46:16.374
Just out of morbid curiosity.

603
00:46:17.843 --> 00:46:21.012
I just wanna see where
Melissa ended up, and well,

604
00:46:21.012 --> 00:46:23.748
everyone will ask
me if I saw it.

605
00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:30.255
- Okay.

606
00:46:30.255 --> 00:46:32.757
(keys rattle)

607
00:46:35.894 --> 00:46:38.429
I advise against
touching anything.

608
00:46:39.497 --> 00:46:40.331
- I won't.

609
00:46:43.701 --> 00:46:44.535
Thanks.

610
00:46:45.871 --> 00:46:48.806
(footsteps recede)

611
00:46:53.178 --> 00:46:57.815
(steam hisses)
(water drips)

612
00:46:57.815 --> 00:47:00.285
(door creaks)

613
00:47:01.552 --> 00:47:04.055
(door creaks)

614
00:47:07.258 --> 00:47:12.263
(steam hisses)
(water drips)

615
00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:47.698
(flies buzz)
(dark piano music)

616
00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:02.213
(flies buzz)

617
00:48:05.416 --> 00:48:08.386
(ominous music)

618
00:48:08.386 --> 00:48:11.722
(muffled woman screams)

619
00:48:14.325 --> 00:48:16.861
(grunts) No!
(intense orchestral music)

620
00:48:16.861 --> 00:48:17.695
No!

621
00:48:18.763 --> 00:48:19.697
Let me out!

622
00:48:23.034 --> 00:48:25.636
(Lily screams)

623
00:48:30.275 --> 00:48:31.109
No!

624
00:48:40.385 --> 00:48:43.188
(door creaks)

625
00:48:43.188 --> 00:48:45.923
(water splashes)

626
00:49:04.375 --> 00:49:07.378
(suspenseful music)

627
00:49:15.353 --> 00:49:17.755
(Lily pants)

628
00:49:18.956 --> 00:49:21.626
(faucet hisses)

629
00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:25.363
(faucet hisses)

630
00:49:29.334 --> 00:49:31.736
(Lily pants)

631
00:49:33.238 --> 00:49:35.040
(ominous tones)

632
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.475
(Lily gasps)

633
00:49:40.011 --> 00:49:42.780
(water splashes)

634
00:49:45.516 --> 00:49:50.521
(clock ticks rhythmically)
(dark orchestral music)

635
00:50:06.904 --> 00:50:08.339
(TV static crackles)

636
00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:11.642
So, the 14th floor wasn't
working, apparently.

637
00:50:11.642 --> 00:50:13.744
So, when was the last
time it was working?

638
00:50:21.252 --> 00:50:22.687
Shit.

639
00:50:22.687 --> 00:50:23.788
He's playing the game.

640
00:50:25.923 --> 00:50:28.459
Wait. What numbers are those?

641
00:50:28.459 --> 00:50:29.294
Oh.

642
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:32.663
- Five.

643
00:50:34.265 --> 00:50:35.100
One.

644
00:50:39.604 --> 00:50:40.405
10.

645
00:50:42.107 --> 00:50:43.241
Is that eight?

646
00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:48.079
Come on, Ray, what can you
see? What can you hear?

647
00:50:53.218 --> 00:50:54.752
So, five, one, ten.

648
00:50:56.887 --> 00:50:57.688
Eight.

649
00:51:02.293 --> 00:51:03.128
Maybe six?

650
00:51:05.863 --> 00:51:09.467
(dark music continues)

651
00:51:09.467 --> 00:51:10.801
Then...

652
00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:11.636
Nine.

653
00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.842
Is that the ninth floor?

654
00:51:26.417 --> 00:51:28.753
(elevator doors hum)

655
00:51:28.753 --> 00:51:32.022
(elevator doors clack)

656
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:36.327
(dark orchestral music)

657
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:43.701
(elevator doors
squeak and clack)

658
00:52:04.822 --> 00:52:08.993
(elevator doors

659
00:52:11.429 --> 00:52:14.432
(suspenseful music)

660
00:52:19.904 --> 00:52:21.639
- Mommy, is that you?

661
00:52:24.509 --> 00:52:27.378
Don't you want to
talk to me, Mommy?

662
00:52:27.378 --> 00:52:29.780
(Lily pants)

663
00:52:30.715 --> 00:52:32.883
Don't you love me anymore?

664
00:52:35.186 --> 00:52:37.322
(Lily gasps)

665
00:52:37.322 --> 00:52:38.155
Mommy?

666
00:52:41.025 --> 00:52:42.493
Please look at me.

667
00:52:42.493 --> 00:52:47.097
(elevator doors clack)
(Lily pants)

668
00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:49.767
(ominous music)

669
00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:13.291
(lights crackle)

670
00:53:17.595 --> 00:53:18.696
Hello, Mommy.

671
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:35.680
(music swells and intensifies)

672
00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.685
(ominous music)
(lights crackle)

673
00:53:41.286 --> 00:53:43.588
(Lily pants)

674
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:48.158
(Lily pants)

675
00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:50.661
(Iris laughs)

676
00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:54.499
(Lily pants)

677
00:54:05.443 --> 00:54:06.444
Mommy!

678
00:54:06.444 --> 00:54:09.847
(eerie orchestral music)

679
00:54:24.595 --> 00:54:27.465
(elevator doors clack)

680
00:54:27.465 --> 00:54:30.801
(eerie music continues)

681
00:54:33.538 --> 00:54:38.543
(Lily screams)
(intense orchestral music)

(water splashes)

684
00:55:08.873 --> 00:55:11.208
(mop thuds)

685
00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:30.227
- You all right?

686
00:55:30.227 --> 00:55:33.063
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

687
00:55:34.732 --> 00:55:36.901
- I don't know what I saw.

688
00:55:39.637 --> 00:55:40.638
- I'm sorry?

689
00:55:43.007 --> 00:55:44.875
- I don't know
what's going on here.

690
00:55:48.112 --> 00:55:49.847
What's real and what's not.

691
00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:54.284
It's like I'm living
an endless nightmare.

692
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.221
I'm barely sleeping.

693
00:55:58.823 --> 00:56:01.792
And even when I do, it
doesn't feel like I have.

694
00:56:01.792 --> 00:56:02.660
I just sit,

695
00:56:04.128 --> 00:56:07.131
wondering what's going on
upstairs in the rooms above me.

696
00:56:08.899 --> 00:56:11.402
Going slightly more
crazy each day.

697
00:56:13.638 --> 00:56:17.975
And right now, I'm gonna
go back up to my room.

698
00:56:19.276 --> 00:56:20.678
I'm gonna go to bed,

699
00:56:21.779 --> 00:56:23.681
and I'm gonna struggle
to sleep again,

700
00:56:25.049 --> 00:56:28.118
because of leaky
roofs and flies.

701
00:56:30.287 --> 00:56:31.622
I can't do this.

702
00:56:37.127 --> 00:56:39.630
- Would you like some company?

703
00:56:43.768 --> 00:56:46.370
(Norton pants)

704
00:56:47.905 --> 00:56:50.475

(Norton sighs)

707
00:56:56.046 --> 00:56:58.282
(both sigh)

708
00:56:58.282 --> 00:56:59.116
- Shit.

709
00:57:01.486 --> 00:57:02.653
That was good.

710
00:57:05.556 --> 00:57:08.993
It's like you're inside my mind.

711
00:57:08.993 --> 00:57:11.328
Like you knew what I wanted.

712
00:57:12.963 --> 00:57:16.133
(both breathe deeply)

713
00:57:20.237 --> 00:57:25.242

719
00:58:25.836 --> 00:58:26.771
Ray's room.

720
00:58:31.809 --> 00:58:34.378
Let's see what we have in here.

721

(door opens)

00:58:37.481 --> 00:58:40.718

"Five points of the pentagram.

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:32.697
One lowly sacrificial lamb.

730
01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:38.769
Ten eyes to witness the deed.

731
01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:43.007
Seven sins to
complete the creed.

732
01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:46.576
Infinity.

733
01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:51.949
Infinite lives on
the mortal Plane.

734
01:00:57.221 --> 01:01:00.090
Nine letters in
the master's name."

735
01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:02.459
B.

736
01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:04.094
E.

737
01:01:04.094 --> 01:01:05.429
E-L-C.

738
01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:08.098
E.

739
01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:09.900
B-B.

740
01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:15.572
(phone camera snaps)

741
01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:28.953
(footsteps clack)

742
01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:33.057
- Good evening,
Lily. Sleep well?

743
01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:35.059
- Same as always.

744
01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:38.729
- Well, it should be
a quiet night tonight.

745
01:01:42.099 --> 01:01:42.933
- Vester.

746
01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:45.369
- [Vester] Hm?

747
01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:47.404
- How long have you
worked here for?

748
01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:51.141
- Oh, I don't know.
Six, seven years.

749
01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:52.877
- Do you enjoy it?

750
01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:56.713
- Well, it has
its ups and downs.

751
01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.983
As they say, a job's a job.

752
01:01:58.983 --> 01:02:00.284
- "A job's a job"?

753
01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.755
All these freaky guests
and gruesome deaths?

754
01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:08.692
Sorry. I meant suicides.

755
01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:11.628
But yet, you're still here.

756
01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:14.965
Why?

757
01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:17.334
- Why are you still here, Lily?

758
01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:18.402
If you can't handle
all the deaths,

759
01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:19.603
if it's all too exciting.

760
01:02:19.603 --> 01:02:21.071
I'm sure there's
lots of waitress

761
01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:23.573
or librarian jobs back home.

762
01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:24.909
- How'd you put up with it?

763
01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.645
How are you so
unfazed by it all?

764
01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:33.550
How do you let all these
blatant murders happen?

765
01:02:34.952 --> 01:02:37.454
And why are all the deaths
reported as suicides,

766
01:02:37.454 --> 01:02:39.689
when they're quite clearly not?

767
01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:42.326
(Vester snaps fingers)

768
01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:46.196
- Because that's
the way it is, okay?

769
01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:49.099
This is the Imperial Hotel.

770
01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:52.002
And what happens, happens.

771
01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:53.770
I know you're here
to discover the truth

772
01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.506
about Ms. Melissa Valentine.

773
01:02:57.942 --> 01:03:00.878
Well, you're not going
to. It goes too deep.

774
01:03:02.079 --> 01:03:05.082
The hotel knows everything.

775
01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:08.118
It hides everything.

776
01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:09.753
It's like a drug.

777
01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:12.957
It lures you in. It
holds your hostage.

778
01:03:12.957 --> 01:03:14.458
It consumes you.

779
01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:15.559
It becomes you.

780
01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:18.595
And you stay, or you

781
01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:20.630
die.

782
01:03:22.066 --> 01:03:25.936
Now, stop your snooping around
and your little sleuth game.

783
01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:27.337
You're not the first to try.

784
01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:31.041
You're not gonna
uncover the truth.

785
01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:33.844
And whatever you do find,
you'll wish you hadn't.

786
01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:41.919
(dark orchestral music)

787
01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:44.621
(door squeaks)

788
01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:49.626
(keyboard clacks)
(clock ticks rhythmically)

789
01:04:02.039 --> 01:04:04.875
(keyboard clacks)

790
01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:25.162
(dark orchestral music)

791
01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:27.097
- [Margaret] Lily,
you are alive!

792
01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:29.133
- Yeah, and I...

793
01:04:29.133 --> 01:04:30.834
- [Margaret] Haven't
heard from you in ages.

794
01:04:30.834 --> 01:04:33.003
I was beginning
to fear the worst.

795
01:04:33.003 --> 01:04:34.238
What's the news?

796
01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:36.606
- Well, I've delved
into the hotel's past,

797
01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:38.475
and it seems like there's
been numerous black masses

798
01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:40.844
and satanic rituals
performed right on this spot.

799
01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:43.047
A long time before the
hotel was even built.

800
01:04:43.047 --> 01:04:44.414
- [Margaret] (gasps) God.

801
01:04:45.582 --> 01:04:47.817
And do you think that
has something to do

802
01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.253
with all the other deaths?

803
01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:50.921
- Yeah, I'm almost
certain there's some kind

804
01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:53.223
of malevolent spirit
in this place.

805
01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:56.393
- [Margaret] And what about
Melissa and this elevator game?

806
01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.295
Have you played it?
- Yeah, a few times.

807
01:04:58.295 --> 01:05:00.364
- [Margaret] And?

808
01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:02.766
- Well, I think the number
sequence is different.

809
01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:06.170
They're not the usual numbers
and I believe Melissa and Ray

810
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:09.373
have been fed these numbers
by someone, or something, that

811
01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:13.143
that's here, but I
just don't know why.

812
01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:15.912
- [Margaret] And do you
know what those are?

813
01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.114
- Yeah. I might do.

814
01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:18.348
I'm gonna give it a try later.

815
01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:20.750
So, if you don't hear
from me after that-

816
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:24.154
- [Margaret] Listen, I was
thinking of coming up, too.

817
01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:25.389
- What?

818
01:05:25.389 --> 01:05:26.790
- [Margaret] I've
a few days free,

819
01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:29.759
and I thought you could
do with some help.

820
01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.861
Get to the bottom
of this sooner!

821
01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:32.696
- You really don't
need to do that.

822
01:05:32.696 --> 01:05:33.930
- [Margaret] Nonsense.

823
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.699
I'm sure you could
do with the support.

824
01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:38.035
Fix me a room. I'll
be up this evening.

825
01:05:38.035 --> 01:05:39.303
Anyway, must dash.

826
01:05:51.115 --> 01:05:52.649
- Miss Carrington, I presume.

827
01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:56.720
- That's Mrs.
Carrington. I'm no miss.

828
01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.024
I assume Lily told
you I was coming,

829
01:06:00.024 --> 01:06:03.260
and you've reserved your
finest room for me, I hope!

830
01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:07.431
If you have such a thing.

831
01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:11.535
- Oh, absolutely.
May I take your bags?

832
01:06:11.535 --> 01:06:15.839
- No. I'm quite capable
of carrying it myself.

833
01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:18.575
Now, where is my niece?

834
01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.177
She's not still in bed, I hope.

835
01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:24.248
Oh, there you are!
- Aunt.

836
01:06:24.248 --> 01:06:25.315
- About time.

837
01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.218
About time, too.

838
01:06:28.218 --> 01:06:29.919
Now, you can show me to my room.

839
01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:32.589
About time for a drink.
- Yeah, of course.

840
01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:37.894
(alcohol splashes)

841
01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:40.064
- (sighs) Bloody hell.

842
01:06:40.064 --> 01:06:43.600
Is that really their
best room? (chuckles)

843
01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.737
Reminds me of backpacking in
South America in the '70s.

844
01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:51.408
I bet I won't get
a wink of sleep.

845
01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:53.143
- I'm sure you'll be fine.

846
01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:54.878
I ordered your usual.

847
01:06:54.878 --> 01:06:57.981
(alcohol splashes)

848
01:06:57.981 --> 01:07:00.484
- Oh, well done!

849
01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:06.590
Just what the doctor ordered.

850
01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:08.625
- No, no. I start my shift soon.

851
01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:11.061
- [Vester] Oh, don't
worry about it.

852
01:07:11.061 --> 01:07:12.596
Live a little.

853
01:07:12.596 --> 01:07:14.164
Just the one. You've earned it.

854
01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.134
Ladies. Good evening.

855
01:07:20.837 --> 01:07:22.172
- Where did you find him?

856
01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:26.310
The Overlook Hotel? (chuckles)

857
01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:28.978
Anyway.

858
01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:29.813
Cheers.

859
01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:36.420
(Margaret sighs)

860
01:07:39.923 --> 01:07:42.326
(dark music)

861
01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:16.025
(Lily sighs)

862
01:08:17.894 --> 01:08:20.297
(Lily sighs)

863
01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:24.568
(Lily sighs)

864
01:09:03.307 --> 01:09:08.312
(door creaks)
(suspenseful music)

865
01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:12.382
- Marge?

866
01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:15.852
Margaret.

867
01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:20.089
(door creaks)

868
01:09:26.563 --> 01:09:30.500
(chanting in foreign language)

869
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:44.314
(ominous music)
(chanting in foreign language)

870
01:09:57.761 --> 01:10:01.698
(chanting in foreign language)

871
01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:17.080
(chanting in foreign language)

872
01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:23.920
(flesh tears)

873
01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.756
(Margaret chokes)

874
01:10:32.629 --> 01:10:35.965
(dark orchestral music)

875
01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:43.340
(clock ticks rhythmically)

876
01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.140
13.

877
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:48.945
"13 is the level of his domain."

878
01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:58.522
(Lily sighs)

879
01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:08.898
(clock ticks rhythmically)
(dark music continues)

880
01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.568
(water splashes)

881

883

01:11:49.373 --> 01:11:51.608
(elevator doors
squeak and clack)

887
01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:54.243
(elevator hums)

888
01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.217
(button clicks)

889
01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:09.192
(eerie orchestral music)

890
01:12:11.528 --> 01:12:13.262
- Mommy, is that you?

891
01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:22.872
Don't you wanna
talk to me, Mommy?

892
01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:26.610
Don't you love me anymore?

893
01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:28.412
Mommy?

894
01:12:29.613 --> 01:12:31.748
Please look at me.

895
01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:35.919
(elevator doors
squeak and clack)

896
01:12:37.754 --> 01:12:38.588
Mommy.

897
01:12:42.726 --> 01:12:46.062
(eerie music continues)

898
01:12:47.931 --> 01:12:50.366

(Lily pants)

901
01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:24.734
(Vester laughs manically)

902
01:13:47.223 --> 01:13:50.660
(eerie orchestral music)

903
01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.053
- You found me.

904
01:14:18.522 --> 01:14:19.355
- I did.

905
01:14:21.858 --> 01:14:24.894
Although, I feel like
a part of your plan.

906
01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:26.996
- I might have nudged you
in the right direction

907
01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:28.732
every now and then, but,

908
01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:32.168
you did exceedingly well.

909
01:14:34.838 --> 01:14:36.305
Congratulations.

910
01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:39.475
Your boss would've been proud.

911
01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:43.513
- You didn't have to kill her.

912
01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:47.383
- There was every
need to kill her.

913
01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:51.888
There's no need to kill anyone.

914
01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:57.894
And yet, humans have been doing
it since the dawn of time.

915
01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:01.565
They do it, because they can.

916
01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:04.801
They do it, because
they want to.

917
01:15:04.801 --> 01:15:07.871
It makes them feel better.

918
01:15:09.038 --> 01:15:10.406
And that's all we're doing.

919
01:15:11.307 --> 01:15:12.141
Me.

920
01:15:12.141 --> 01:15:13.342
Vester.

921
01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.177
Seth.

922
01:15:15.645 --> 01:15:16.479
Hank.

923
01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:22.185
- (gasps) So, what
do you want with me?

924
01:15:25.088 --> 01:15:26.990
(eerie tones)

925
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:29.659
(Norton laughs)

926
01:15:30.594 --> 01:15:32.495
(Lily pants)

927
01:15:32.495 --> 01:15:33.863
(Lily grunts)

928
01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:36.833
- [Norton] Have you
never figured that out?

929
01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:39.302
You found all the numbers.

930
01:15:39.302 --> 01:15:41.571
You found the right sequence.

931
01:15:41.571 --> 01:15:45.008
You made your way
to the 13th floor.

932
01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:49.412
But you never once
stopped to question

933
01:15:49.412 --> 01:15:53.149
why I was leading you
down the garden path?

934
01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:57.453
That's funny.

935
01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:01.157
I always thought that
a woman could tell.

936
01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:08.632
(bat whooshes)

937
01:16:08.632 --> 01:16:09.532
We had a

938
01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:13.502
wonderful night together.

939
01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:16.572
(Norton chuckles)

940
01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.241
We shook the walls.

941
01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:26.082
I've seen a lot of people
come through my hotel,

942
01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:28.818
over the years, but you...

943
01:16:31.054 --> 01:16:33.222
From the moment I met you,

944
01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:38.161
from the moment that
we first touched,

945
01:16:40.363 --> 01:16:43.366
when you looked into
my eyes, I knew.

946
01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:47.671
You were the one.

947
01:16:49.973 --> 01:16:50.807
- I am not

948
01:16:52.642 --> 01:16:54.077
having your baby.

949
01:16:55.411 --> 01:16:57.847
(Lily pants)

950
01:16:59.082 --> 01:17:00.149
- Is that so?

951
01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:04.320
- I'd rather kill myself.

952
01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:06.155
- No.

953
01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:08.825
No.

954
01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.762
That's another one.

955
01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:17.867
- I'm not having
your child, Beelz!

956
01:17:19.202 --> 01:17:21.705
- You will do as you ought to!

957
01:17:24.207 --> 01:17:25.508
- No man tells me what to do!

958
01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:26.676
- I am no man.

959
01:17:31.781 --> 01:17:35.184
That has always been your
problem, though, hasn't it?

960
01:17:36.686 --> 01:17:37.520
Men.

961
01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:40.824
Relationships.

962
01:17:40.824 --> 01:17:42.225
Commitment.

963
01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.996
You're a clingy little
thing, aren't you?

964
01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:52.001
Tell me, how exactly did you
scare off your last boyfriend?

965
01:17:54.738 --> 01:17:56.940
- He didn't deserve me.

966
01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.475
- Same way Iris
didn't deserve you.

967
01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:00.710
- Shut up about her.

968
01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:04.781
- I have to say, I'm

969
01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:08.484
disappointed that
you would be so

970
01:18:09.953 --> 01:18:11.287
careless.

971
01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:15.191
Really.

972
01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:17.660
Leaving your daughter alone,

973
01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:19.462
to drown.

974
01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:24.267
- No.

975
01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:28.504
I left her alone
for two minutes.

976
01:18:28.504 --> 01:18:29.672
- Two minutes.

977
01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:34.643
120 seconds.

978
01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:40.183
- It's a long time
to hold your breath,

979
01:18:40.183 --> 01:18:42.118
if you're underwater, Lily.

980
01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:47.957
Do you think you could do that?

981
01:18:49.258 --> 01:18:52.361
Do you think you
could do that, Lily?

982
01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:56.599
Do you think you
could hold your breath

983
01:18:58.167 --> 01:18:59.502
for 120 seconds?

984
01:19:06.109 --> 01:19:06.943
Tick.

985
01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:08.812
Tick.

986
01:19:09.813 --> 01:19:10.646
Tick.

987
01:19:12.048 --> 01:19:12.849
Tick.

988
01:19:13.917 --> 01:19:16.252
(bat thuds)

989
01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:21.157
(Norton sighs)

990
01:19:21.157 --> 01:19:22.058
I didn't think so.

991
01:19:25.228 --> 01:19:30.233
(bat hisses)
(Norton shrieks)

992
01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.502
(Norton sighs)

993
01:19:36.005 --> 01:19:37.540
You came prepared.

994
01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:41.344
- This is my hotel.

995
01:19:41.344 --> 01:19:42.411
- Your hotel?

996
01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:45.481
Your hotel?

997
01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:46.682
No.

998
01:19:46.682 --> 01:19:48.251
This is

999
01:19:48.251 --> 01:19:49.085
my hotel.

1000
01:19:50.753 --> 01:19:55.258
Before there was time,
before there was anything,

1001
01:19:55.258 --> 01:19:57.861
there was nothing.

1002
01:19:57.861 --> 01:20:00.296
And before there was nothing,

1003
01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:02.431
there was me.

1004
01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:03.266
I

1005
01:20:03.266 --> 01:20:04.467
am

1006
01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:06.302
Beelzebub.

1007
01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:08.337
Lord of flies.

1008
01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:11.707
You think you can
just push me out?

1009
01:20:11.707 --> 01:20:14.277
(Norton roars)

1010
01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:20.183
(Lily yelps)
(flies buzz)

1011
01:20:21.117 --> 01:20:24.720
(Lily pants)
(flies buzz)

1012
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.056
(bat thuds)

1013
01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:31.294
(bat thuds)
(Lily pants)

1014
01:20:31.294 --> 01:20:35.498
(demon groans)
(bat thuds)

1015
01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:40.503
(demon screams)
(flames crackle)

1016
01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:46.910
(flames roar and crackle)

1017
01:20:54.283 --> 01:20:57.753
(flames roar and crackle)

1018
01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.730
(flames crackle)

1019
01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:12.735
(somber orchestral music)
(flames crackle)

1020
01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:30.153
(dark percussive music)

1021
01:21:52.875 --> 01:21:55.778
(eerie tones ring)

1022
01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:06.355
(dark music swells
and intensifies)

1023
01:22:16.899 --> 01:22:21.237
(dark music swells
and intensifies)

1024
01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:30.913
(distant siren wails)

1025
01:22:30.913 --> 01:22:33.316
(dark music)

1026
01:22:57.606 --> 01:23:00.609
(somber piano music)

1027
01:24:08.644 --> 01:24:12.248
(intense orchestral music)

1028
01:24:56.159 --> 01:24:59.595
(dark orchestral music)
