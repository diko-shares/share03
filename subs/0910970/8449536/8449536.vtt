<i>Let's get the heck out of here.</i>

550
01:09:02.155 --> 01:09:04.415
Now, the plant.

551
01:09:04.525 --> 01:09:06.485
No. Wait a minute.

552
01:09:06.585 --> 01:09:09.007
<i>Computer, when was that message
sent out to the Axiom?</i>

553
01:09:09.055 --> 01:09:11.495
<i>Message received in the year 2110.</i>

554
01:09:11.595 --> 01:09:14.995
That's... That's nearly 700 years ago!

555
01:09:15.095 --> 01:09:18.187
Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.

556
01:09:18.235 --> 01:09:20.957
Sir, orders are "do
not return to Earth."

557
01:09:21.005 --> 01:09:25.945
But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant. Green and growing.

558
01:09:26.045 --> 01:09:29.427
- It's living proof he was wrong.
- Irrelevant, Captain.

559
01:09:29.475 --> 01:09:33.475
What? It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.

560
01:09:33.585 --> 01:09:34.845
Home, Auto.

561
01:09:34.955 --> 01:09:38.737
And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

562
01:09:38.785 --> 01:09:40.137
That's all I've ever done.

563
01:09:40.185 --> 01:09:43.547
That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!

564
01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:45.925
<i>On the Axiom you will survive.</i>

565
01:09:46.025 --> 01:09:50.756
- I don't want to survive. I want to live!
- Must follow my directive.

566
01:10:08.815 --> 01:10:11.345
<i>I'm the captain of the Axiom.</i>

567
01:10:11.455 --> 01:10:14.085
We are going home today.

568
01:10:19.765 --> 01:10:20.925
GO-4?

569
01:10:21.765 --> 01:10:23.695
Hey! That's not...

570
01:10:23.795 --> 01:10:26.355
This is mutiny! EVE, arrest him.

571
01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:36.759
EVE, you are to put this plant
straight in the holo-detector.

572
01:10:37.175 --> 01:10:38.165
No!

573
01:10:48.455 --> 01:10:49.485
Huh?

574
01:10:51.295 --> 01:10:53.695
- EVE?
- WALL-E!

575
01:10:53.795 --> 01:10:55.455
EVE!

576
01:10:57.065 --> 01:10:58.357
- Oh!
- WALL-E, the plant!

577
01:10:58.405 --> 01:10:59.857
- WALL-E!
- Over here. Throw it.

578
01:10:59.905 --> 01:11:00.865
Ahhh!

579
01:11:01.235 --> 01:11:02.205
EVE!

580
01:11:03.405 --> 01:11:04.995
Give me the plant.

581
01:11:21.495 --> 01:11:23.225
WALL-E!

582
01:11:33.365 --> 01:11:35.687
All communications are terminated.

583
01:11:35.735 --> 01:11:37.457
You are confined to quarters.

584
01:11:37.505 --> 01:11:38.835
No! Mutiny!

585
01:11:39.305 --> 01:11:40.505
Mutiny!

586
01:12:00.025 --> 01:12:00.985

Whoa!

600
01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:36.015

617
01:16:03.465 --> 01:16:04.595
Wrong.

618
01:16:18.815 --> 01:16:20.937
Please hold.

619
01:16:20.985 --> 01:16:21.945
EVE!

620
01:16:22.055 --> 01:16:23.035

628
01:17:14.235 --> 01:17:16.105
Mutiny. Mutiny.

629
01:17:17.405 --> 01:17:19.165
Stupid wheel.

<i>- Look what I got, Auto.

<i>You want it? Come and get it, blinky.</i>

649
01:18:30.975 --> 01:18:31.965
No.

Captain? Captain?

651
01:18:42.725 --> 01:18:43.885
Let go.

652
01:18:44.795 --> 01:18:47.224
- Let go.
- Too heavy for you? Huh?

653
01:18:49.435 --> 01:18:50.395
Get off.

654
01:18:50.444 --> 01:18:52.217
You're not getting away
from me, one-eye.

655
01:18:52.265 --> 01:18:54.551
- Get off.
- Is that all you got?

656
01:19:08.415 --> 01:19:09.475
Halt.

657
01:19:12.959 --> 01:19:15.107
- That's it. A little closer.
- Cease and desist.

658
01:19:15.155 --> 01:19:17.095
- Not good.
- Got you.

659
01:19:42.555 --> 01:19:43.775
Whoa!

660
01:19:53.825 --> 01:19:56.825

667
01:20:32.665 --> 01:20:34.105
