they can begin to process this pain.

My Harry passed away five years ago,
but he was so miserable.

His spirit would not leave the apartment.

186
00:13:19.383 --> 00:13:22.302
So I called Dr. Harvey. He came over

187
00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:25.681
and in a few weeks Harry left

00:13:27.558 --> 00:13:31.144
HARVEY: The living-impaired
are known for haunting us.

190
00:13:31.854 --> 00:13:34.147
My question is, what's haunting them?

191
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.650
It's a lack of resolution.

192
00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:39.862
Ghosts are simply spirits without resolution.

193
00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:43.907
With unfinished business.
And it's my job to find out what that is.
