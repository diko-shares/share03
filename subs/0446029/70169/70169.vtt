Really? Is she hot?

How old are you now, Scott? Like, 28?

SCOTT: I'm not playing
your little games, kids.

7
00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:48.455
So, you've been out of high school
for, like, 13 years.

I'm 22. Twenty-two.

And you're dating a high-school girl.
Not bad, not bad.

So, did you guys, like, you know, do it yet?

12
00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:04.599
We have done many things.

13
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.351
We ride the bus together.

14
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:10.560
And we have meaningful conversations
about how yearbook club went

15
00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:13.772
and about her friends
and, you know, drama.

STEPHEN: Have you even kissed her?

17
00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.026
We almost held hands once,
but then she got embarrassed.

for Pac-Man was Puck-Man?

You'd think it was because
he looks like a hockey puck,

126

but it actually comes from
the Japanese phrase ”paku-paku, "

which means,
"to flap one's mouth open and closed."

"Puck-Man" would be too easy to vandalize.

175
00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:58.295
There you go.

176
00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:02.550
- Wow.
- Yeah.

177
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.806
Wow.

178
00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:13.818
Oh, God.

179
00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:18.107
So alone.

180
00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:22.619
- You're not alone.
- What?

181
00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:25.447
You're just having some idiotic dream.

182
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.075
Does that mean we can make out?

183
00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.955
Oh, God!

184
00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.287
- What is it, Scott?
- I had this totally weird dream.

185
00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:33.588
Oh, God.

186
00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:34.915
What is it, Other Scott?

187
00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:38.294
Can we skip the dreamtime?
Color me not interested.

188
00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:41.050
- But there was this girl.
- Girl?

189
00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.597
Was this an Envy-related dream?

190
00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.266
We don't use the E-word in this house.

191
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:47.435
No, it wasn't her. It was somebody new.

192
00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.479
Yay for that.

193
00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:52.729
Speaking of new, weren't you supposed
to take your fake high-school girlfriend

194
00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.401
to the library a half-hour ago?

195
00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:56.978
What? It's like 6:00 in the morning.

196
00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:58.730

197
00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.191
MAN: Shh!

198
00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:04.449
- It's weird.
- What's weird?

199
00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:07.281
Libraries remind me of grade school.

200
00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.787
That must seem like a really long time ago.

201
00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.540
Yeah, let's talk about something else.

202
00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.102
Do you know that girl?

203
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.480
- Scott!
- What?

204
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.983
You only played one note
for that entire song.

205
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.072
My hand slipped.

206
00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:44.743
- Is your girlfriend distracting you?
- My girlfriend?

207
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.160
I'll be quieter.

208
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.873
- Let's do that one again.
- Sorry, what are we doing?

209
00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.290
I told you, like, 50 times!

210
00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.163
We're going to this party, retard.

211
00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.416
- Party?
- At Julie's.

212
00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:56.496
I thought you guys split up.

213
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.049
We did, but there might be
some label guys there, so, you know...

214
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.001
- Oh, man, this is gonna suck.
- Suck!

215
00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:03.257
At least it" give us something
to complain about.

216
00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:04.429
Oh, man!

217
00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:06.802
- This sucks!
- Sucks!

218
00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.931
I'm gonna go pee due to boredom.

219
00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:12.478
I have to pee.

220
00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.147
You know, so I told him
you've got a really good sound,

221
00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:17.727
and I think that you should market
your sound to deaf people, because...

222
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.276
- Scott! Hey!
- Hey, Comeau.

223
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.196
How about this party?
You getting your drink on here?

224
00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.114
No, I don't drink. This is just Coke Zero.

225
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.487
What do you mean, you don't drink?

226
00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.909
I distinctly remember you being very drunk
off a couple of G-and-T's...

227
00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:30.489
- Hey, Comeau, you know everyone, right?
- Yeah, pretty much, I do.

228
00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.499
You know this one girl with hair like this?

229
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:33.746
Yes, that's Ramona Flowers.

230
00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:35.827
Somebody said
she was gonna be here tonight, actually.

231
00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.208
- What?
- Oh, Scott.

232
00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.380
You have the hots for her or something?
I gotta tell you though,

233
00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:40.923
I hear that she's a little hardcore.

234
00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:04.773
(ALL CHATTERING)

235
00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:25.385
- Hey, what's up?
- Nothing.

236
00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:28.554
- Hey, you know Pac-Man?
- I know of him.

237
00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:32.009
Well, Pac-Man was originally
called Puck-Man.

238
00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:34.598
They changed it because...

239
00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:36.771
Not because Pac-Man looks
like a hockey puck.

240
00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.270
"Paku-paku” means "flap your mouth,"

241
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.943
and that they were afraid
people would change...

242
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.819
Scratch out the "P"
and turn it into an "F' like...

243
00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:47.948
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

244
00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.697
Yeah, that's amazing.

245
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.236
Um...

246
00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:53.618
Am I dreaming?

247
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.998
- I'll leave you alone forever now.
- Thanks.

248
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:07.336
- Dude!
- What?

249
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.670
- She's totally real!
- Who?

250
00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.301
- Ramona Flowers.
- What?

251
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:12.473
Dude! What do you know
about Ramona Flowers?

252
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.302
- All I know is that she is American.
- American.

253
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:17.979
Why don't you go talk to Sandra
and Monique? They know a lot more.

254
00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.148
Lady-dudes.
What do you know about Ramona Flowers?

255
00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:23.147
- I heard she has a boyfriend.
- Yeah. Some guy back in New York.

256
00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:24.819
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What else?

257
00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:27.318
I heard she kicks all kinds of ass.

258
00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:29.900
She's on another level.

259
00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.860
She has men dying at her feet.

260
00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:34.571
She's got some battle scars, dude.

261
00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.163
What about Ramona Flowers?

262
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.241
- You know her? Tell me now.
- She just moved here.

263
00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:40.873
- Got a job at Amazon. Comes into my work.
- Does she really?

264
00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:42.749
Didn't you say
she just broke up with someone?

265
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.875
Did she really?

266
00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:46.298
- They had a huge fight, or whatever.
- Did they really?

267
00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:48.753
Yes! But I didn't want Scott
to know that, Stephen.

268
00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:50.803
Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl.

269
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.052
Scott, I forbid you from hitting on Ramona,

270
00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:55.258
even if you haven't had a real girlfriend
in over a year.

271

(EXHALES SHARPLY)

272
00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:59.600
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Scott's mourning period is officially over.

273
00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:01.606
He's totally dating a high-schooler.

274
00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:03.649
Dating a high-schooler
is the mourning period.

275
00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:04.851
She's got a point.

276
00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.027
I thought you guys broke up.

277
00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.856
I don't want you scaring off
the coolest girl at my party, Scott.

278
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.533
We all know
you're a total lady-killer wannabe, jerky-jerk.

279
00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.030
That's completely untrue.

280
00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:14.907
- That time with Lisa?
- That was a misunderstanding.

281
00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.908
- That time with Hollie?
- That wasn't what it looked like.

282
00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:18.034
- That time you dumped Kim for...
Okay.

283
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.912
Me and Kim are all good now, all right?

284
00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:24.709
Whatever! Ramona's out of your league.
Let's just leave it at that.

285
00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:27.086
Besides, I'm not even sure
she did have a big breakup.

286
00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.338
She keeps mentioning
some guy named Gideon.

287
00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:32.217
- Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl.
- Forget it, Scott!

(ALL EXCLAIM)

290
00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:39.973
I guess Wallace.

291
00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:41.850
You guess right.

292
00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:46.893
So, that girl from my dream...

293
00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:48.228
Girl. Okay.

294
00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:49.733
I saw her at the library.

295
00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:52.441
Library. Can I pretend
we're talking about a guy?

296
00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:55.653
And then I'm at this party
and, hey, there she is.

297
00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:56.736
Hey, there he is.

298
00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:58.788
- I think she's...
- I think he's...

299
00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.116
I think she's the girl of my dreams.

300
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.200
Mmm.

301
00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:04.665
Then you should break up
with your fake high-school girlfriend.

302
00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:06.462
I've never been so sure about something.

303
00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:09.041
Then you should break up
with your fake high-school girlfriend.

304

What's that?

305
00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:13.424
You should break up
with your fake high-school girlfriend.

306

how sucky it is to get cheated on.

a mass text about this. Bye.

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.061
That's sucky.

346
00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:56.318
Hannah broke up with Alan
and now she's all into Derek.

347
00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.696
But then Tamara claims
she has dibs on Derek.

348
00:17:58.786 --> 00:17:59.776
I tell you.

349
00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:02.578
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Bad!

350
00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:04.447
Bad!

351
00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:06.241
Bad!

352
00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:08.496
Bad!

353
00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.287
Bad!

354
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:12.588
Okay. I'm sorry, that was all me.

355
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:13.957
Solo round!

356
00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:15.834
Uh-oh.

357
00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.419
Nega ninja.

358
00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.003
Nega ninja!

359
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:20.429
I can never get past that guy.

360
00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.470
Don't beat yourself up about it.

361
00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:24.722
Game over!

362
00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:27.099
Do you want to keep going?

363
00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:29.556
Continue? Nine, eight,

364
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.733
-seven, six, five...
- I think...

365
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.232
-...four, three...
- I think that we should...

366
00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.280
...two, one.

367
00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:47.074
Game on, everybody. Game on.

368
00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:48.450
I got us a show.

369
00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:51.206
- Oh, my gosh, when?
- Wednesday.

370
00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:55.006
- The Rockit. And even better, it's the T.I.B.B.
- Whoa!

371
00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:56.582
The Toronto International Battle
of the Bands?

372
00:18:56.677 --> 00:18:57.667
That's right.

373
00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:00.299
This guy at work was like,
"Steve, you know anybody in a band?"

374
00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:03.848
And I was like, "I'm in a band."
And he was like, "You're in a band?"

375
00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:06.266
And I was like, "Yeah, I am totally in a band."

376
00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:07.435
Great story, man.

377
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:08.852
Is there a prize or something?

378
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.352
Only a record deal with G-Man Graves.

379
00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.900
- Who's that?
- You don't know?

380
00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.772
Indie producer of the millennium.

381
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.020
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

382
00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:21.866
If we win, it won't just be
Knives wearing Sex Bob-Omb shirts.

383
00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:24.535
It'll be the cool kids, too.

384
00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:25.612
I promise

385
00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:29.495
I will do everything I can
to get out of the study group and come.

386
00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:32.119
I have to pee.

387
00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:35.547
KNIVES: Oh, my gosh, who are you battling?
STEPHEN: Crash and the Boys.

388
00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:38.341
NEIL: That one band
with Crash, and those boys?

389
00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:39.588
KIM: Yeah, that's the one.

390
00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:42.171
NEIL: I hate them.
KNIVES: Oh, my gosh, I hate them, too.

391
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.380
STEPHEN: Yeah, they suck.
NEIL: They suck bad.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

397
00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:29.555
Uh, Scott Pilgrim?

398
00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:33.309
Hi, I was thinking about asking you out,
but then I realized how stupid that would be.

399
00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:34.730
So, do you want to go out sometime?

400
00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:37.858
No, that's okay.
You can just sign for this, all right?

401
00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:39.902
I just woke up, and you were in my dream.

402
00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:42.822
I dreamt that you were delivering me
this package. Is that weird?

403
00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.237
- It's not weird at all.
- It's not?

404
00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:47.694
No, it's just that you have this
really convenient subspace highway

405
00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:49.199
running through your head that I like to use.

406
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.372
- It's, like, three miles in 15 seconds.
- Right, right.

407
00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.245
I forgot you guys don't have that in Canada.

408
00:20:53.544 --> 00:20:55.911
You don't remember me, do you?
We met at the party the other day.

409
00:20:56.005 --> 00:20:57.791
- Were you the Pac-Man guy?
- No.

410
00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.919
Not even. That was some total ass.

411
00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:01.590
I was the other guy.

412
00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:03.884
You know, you need to sign for this,
whatever this is.

413
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:06.338
- But if I sign for it, you'll leave.
- Yeah, it's how it works.

414
00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.343
Okay, well, maybe,

415
00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:11.222
do you wanna hang out sometime?
Get to know each other?

416
00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:13.223
You're the new kid on the block, right?

417
00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:18.559
I've lived here forever, so there are reasons
for you to hang out with me.

418
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.481
You want me to hang out with you?

419
00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:24.647
Yeah, if that's cool.

420
00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:27.992
If I say yes,
will you sign for your damn package?

421
00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:30.903
So, yeah, 8:00?

422
00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:35.992
Why are you just standing there?

423
00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:38.164
Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.

424
00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:40.747
I'm sorry, I just assumed
you were too cool to be here on time.

425
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:42.673
Oh, you assumed wrong.

426
00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:46.051
SCOTT: So, how did you end up in Toronto?

427
00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:48.926
- Just needed to escape, I guess.
- Yeah.

428
00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:50.598
I got this job here,
and Gideon had always said

429
00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:53.176
Toronto was one of the great cities, so...

430
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.307
Is Gideon your boyfriend?

431
00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:58.356
He's a friend.

432
00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:01.150
Was he your boyfriend?

433
00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:03.649
Do you mind
if I don't get into that right now?

434
00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:06.106
It's so not interesting to me.

435
00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:08.942
So, what about you? What do you do?

436
00:22:09.036 --> 00:22:13.200
- I'm in between jobs at the moment.
- Between what and what?

437
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:18.376
Well, my last job was a long story
filled with sighs.

438
00:22:18.796 --> 00:22:20.582
I know plenty of those.

439
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:21.913
Is that why you left New York?

440
00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.589
Pretty much.

441
00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:25.713
It was just time to head somewhere
a little more chilled.

442
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.882
- Well, it's certainly chilled here.
- Yeah.

443
00:22:29.223 --> 00:22:31.555
It's chilled, as in cold.

444
00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:33.091
Yeah.

445
00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:39.352
- This is ridiculous. Isn't it, like, April?
- I know.

446
00:22:39.817 --> 00:22:41.774
I can barely see you.

447
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:44.523
This whole thing is an unmitigated disaster.

448
00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:48.447
I think act of God is
a pretty decent excuse for a lousy date.

449
00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:52.402
- So this is a date, eh?
- Did I say date?

450
00:22:52.913 --> 00:22:54.403
Slip of the tongue.

451
00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:56.034
Tongue.

452
00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:58.662
Anyway, night's not over yet.

453
00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.663
I think
there's a thingy over here, somewhere.

454
00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:01.744
A thingy?

455
00:23:02.756 --> 00:23:04.463
A door.

456
00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:09.001
Come on.

457
00:23:24.695 --> 00:23:27.357
- What kind of tea do you want?
- There's more than one kind?

458
00:23:28.782 --> 00:23:31.274
We have blueberry, raspberry,
ginseng, Sleepytime,

459
00:23:31.368 --> 00:23:33.609
green tea, green tea with lemon,
green tea with lemon and honey,

460
00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:35.695
liver disaster, ginger with honey,
ginger without honey,

461
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:37.530
vanilla-almond, white truffle,
blueberry-chamomile,

462
00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:39.912
vanilla-walnut, Constant Comment

463
00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:41.538
and Earl Grey.

464
00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:43.418
Did you make some of those up?

465
00:23:44.006 --> 00:23:45.917
I think I'll have Sleepytime.

466
00:23:46.175 --> 00:23:47.586
That sounds good to me.

467
00:23:49.762 --> 00:23:50.877
Let me get you a blanket.

468
00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:54.130
That would actually be awesome.

00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:08.819
Sorry. I'm just cold.

473
00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:13.695
SCOTT: Yeah, that's very warm. What is that?

474
00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:16.489
Okay.

475
00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:35.672
Were you just gonna bring
the blanket from your bed?

476
00:24:35.766 --> 00:24:37.006
I guess.

477
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:41.686
Maybe we should both get under it,
since we're so cold.

478
00:24:43.023 --> 00:24:45.014
What about our tea?

479
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.271
I can

480
00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:51.062
not have tea.

481
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.621
I changed my mind.

482
00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:03.291
Changed it to what? From what?

483
00:25:03.377 --> 00:25:06.870
I don't wanna have sex with you, Pilgrim.
Not right now.

484
00:25:06.964 --> 00:25:08.796
Okay.

485
00:25:08.882 --> 00:25:11.123
It's not like I'm gonna send you home
in a snowstorm or anything.

486
00:25:11.218 --> 00:25:12.754
You can sleep in my bed.

487
00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:15.712
And I reserve the right to change my mind
about the sex later.

488
00:25:15.806 --> 00:25:19.390
Well, this is nice. Just this.

489
00:25:19.476 --> 00:25:24.437
It's been, like, a really long time,
so I think I needed this, whatever it is,

490
00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:26.605
so thank you.

491
00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.438
You're welcome.

SCOTT: Hey, so,
can this not be a one-night stand?

493
00:25:36.994 --> 00:25:39.702
For one thing, I didn't even get any.
That was a joke.

494
00:25:40.748 --> 00:25:41.909
What did you have in mind?

495
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:44.953
Come to the first round
of this Battle of the Bands thing.

496
00:25:45.044 --> 00:25:47.752
- You have a band?
- Yeah, we're terrible. Please, come?

497

498

Oh! Wait. Can I get your number?

499

Wow. Girl number.

See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim.

501

Hey, it's tonight. At the...

502
00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:08.648
Hey. You totally came.

- Hey!

511

So, do you like?

512
00:26:35.469 --> 00:26:37.460
Well, I...

513
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.523
Have to go.

514
00:26:52.986 --> 00:26:58.982
Okay, this next band is from Brampton,
and they are Crash and the Boys.

515
00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:02.864
God! This is a nightmare.

516
00:27:03.872 --> 00:27:06.204
Is this a nightmare?
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

- Hey, Jimmy.
- Double standard!

697
00:37:43.303 --> 00:37:44.714
I didn't make up the gay rulebook.

698
00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:47.717
You got a problem with it... Stop.
Take it up with Liberace's ghost.

Who's Lucas Lee?

702

Oh!

703
00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:57.977
He was this pretty good skater.
Now he's this pretty good actor.

704
00:37:58.067 --> 00:38:00.058
He's filming a Winifred Hailey movie
in Toronto right now.

705
00:38:00.153 --> 00:38:02.485
- They make movies In Toronto?
- Yes.

706
00:38:02.572 --> 00:38:05.189
- I'm stalking him later.
- So, this Lucas Lee...

707
00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:07.320
Lucas Lee is not important to you right now.
Get out.

and you listen hard, bucko.

No, it's okay. Why?

00:55:50.556 --> 00:55:51.546
You know what,

1042
00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.756
maybe it's high (BLEEP) time
you took a look in a mirror

1043
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:55.512
before you wreak havoc on another girl.

1044
00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:56.717
Me? Wreak havoc?

1045
00:55:56.812 --> 00:55:59.600
And speaking of (BLEEP) which, I hear
the girl that kicked your heart in the ass

1046
00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:00.896
is walking the streets of Toronto again.

1047
00:56:02.276 --> 00:56:03.858
So, I can just get my coffee over here?

1048
00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:08.479
Sorry that got a little crazy last night.

1049
00:56:08.574 --> 00:56:10.906
Yeah, you kind of disappeared.

1050
00:56:11.577 --> 00:56:13.739
Yeah, I do that.

1051
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:18.868
Listen, I know I can be hard
to be around sometimes.

1052
00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:21.538
I totally understand
if you don't want to hang out anymore.

1053
00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:25.838
No, no, I want to hang. You know,
the whole evil ex-boyfriend thing...

1054
00:56:25.924 --> 00:56:28.040
- Exes.
- It's no biggie.

1055
00:56:28.677 --> 00:56:33.717
I know it's early, but I don't think
anything can get in the way of how I...

1056
00:56:33.807 --> 00:56:34.922
Shit!

1057
00:56:36.268 --> 00:56:37.383
It's my ex.

1058
00:56:37.477 --> 00:56:38.717
- A big one?
- Mmm-hmm.

1059
00:56:39.521 --> 00:56:40.852
SCOTT: Envy.

1060
00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:44.770
I'm gonna...

1061
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:47.434
Excuse me.

1062
00:56:49.948 --> 00:56:52.110
- Your hair is getting shaggy.
- Yeah?

1063
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.908
- So, that's Ramona.
- Yeah.

1064
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.531
Okay, I'm jealous.

1065
00:56:56.622 --> 00:56:58.863
- You're jealous?
- I'm allowed.

1066
00:56:59.166 --> 00:57:01.373
You left me for that cocky pretty boy.

1067
00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:03.121
You haven't even seen him.

1068
00:57:03.337 --> 00:57:05.544
I know, you left me for someone
I've never even seen.

1069
00:57:05.631 --> 00:57:08.419
Maybe you will see him.
We're playing Lee's Palace.

1070
00:57:08.508 --> 00:57:11.341
You should so totally come.

1071
00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:13.920
That's so not going to happen.

1072
00:57:14.014 --> 00:57:15.925
Great, you're so on the list.

1073
00:57:17.851 --> 00:57:21.219
Caramel macchiato for (BLEEP) Pilgrim.

1074
00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:23.350
RAMONA: So, that was Envy.

1075
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.475
SCOTT: Uh-huh.

1076
00:57:24.608 --> 00:57:26.064
What happened with the two of you?

1077
00:57:26.151 --> 00:57:28.062
Do you mind
if we don't get into it right now?

1078
00:57:28.153 --> 00:57:31.145
She wanted to move to Montreal,
because she missed her best friend.

1079
00:57:31.615 --> 00:57:33.026
This guy, Todd.

1080
00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:35.073
And two weeks later,
they were sleeping together, I guess?

1081
00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.742
Basically.

1082
00:57:36.828 --> 00:57:39.991
Dated a Todd once. Didn't end well, either.

1083
00:57:40.082 --> 00:57:43.825
I can see how it sucks.
Having the past come back to haunt you.

1084
00:57:44.169 --> 00:57:46.581
Is it wrong that I try not to think about it?

1085
00:57:46.672 --> 00:57:48.208
What do you want to think about?

1086
00:57:48.507 --> 00:57:50.589
How warm my place is right now.

1087
00:57:50.676 --> 00:57:51.666
Oh.

1088
00:57:53.095 --> 00:57:55.837
And you didn't bang her? Are you gay?

1089
00:57:55.931 --> 00:57:58.673
I couldn't stop thinking
about my stupid ex-girlfriend.

1090
00:57:58.767 --> 00:58:00.223
Is that the Uma Thurman movie?

1091
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:04.599
Scott, just because Envy is back in town
doesn't make it not over.

1092
00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:06.772
Double negative. It's tricky.

1093
00:58:06.858 --> 00:58:09.691
- It's over. Move on.
- Word.

1094
00:58:09.861 --> 00:58:12.569
Right. I'm not going to let her toy with me.

1095
00:58:12.864 --> 00:58:14.946
From this moment on,

1096
00:58:15.033 --> 00:58:17.775
I will think of Envy Adams no more!

1097
00:58:19.204 --> 00:58:20.365
I have distressing news.

1098
00:58:20.455 --> 00:58:23.413
Is it news that we suck,
because I really don't think I can take it.

1099
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.492
No. The Clash at Demonhead
are doing a secret show tomorrow night

1100

-and Envy asked us to open for them.
- I hate you.

1101
00:58:29.881 --> 00:58:32.043
A gig is a gig, is a gig, is a gig.

1102
00:58:32.134 --> 00:58:35.672
Maybe you can put your history aside until
we get through this thing, for the band.

1103
00:58:35.762 --> 00:58:37.469
For the band? For the band?

1104
00:58:37.556 --> 00:58:38.921
- Can't we do our...
- For the band?

1105
00:58:39.016 --> 00:58:42.008
- Can't we do our own secret shows?
- All our shows are secret shows.

1106
00:58:42.227 --> 00:58:45.140
We're doing it. G-Man might be there.

1107
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:47.141
We play the next round of the battle
on Tuesday.

1108
00:58:47.232 --> 00:58:50.566
We have to get some buzz going.
We need groundswell.

1109
00:58:50.652 --> 00:58:52.188
We need stalkers.

1110
00:58:59.494 --> 00:59:02.987
What would you do if your ex was in a band
and they wanted you to open for them?

1111
00:59:03.081 --> 00:59:04.742
If my ex was in a band?

1112
00:59:04.833 --> 00:59:05.823
Mmm-hmm.

1113
00:59:06.418 --> 00:59:09.877
Might be a little awkward, but maybe
it's the grown-up thing to do.

1114
00:59:09.963 --> 00:59:12.580
Yeah. We're all adults here, right?

I hate her stupid guts!

1119

He only likes her because she's old.
She's probably, like, 25!

1120
00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:27.560
She's just some fat-ass white girl,
you know?

1121
00:59:27.647 --> 00:59:29.558
I think you mentioned she was fat.

1122
00:59:29.649 --> 00:59:30.980
She's got a head start.

1123
00:59:31.068 --> 00:59:34.436
I mean, I didn't even know
there was good music until two months ago!

I don't know. Did you?

TODD: What?

1218
01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:11.549
I'm not afraid to hit a girl.

1219
01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:15.011
I'm a rock star.

1220
01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:16.262
NEIL: Oh, my God!

1221
01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:19.644
You punched the highlights out of her hair.

1222
01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:23.895
He punched the highlights out of her hair!

1223
01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:26.018
You are incorrigible.

1224
01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:28.194
I don't know the meaning of the word.

1225
01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:34.903
So, you guys doing anything fun
while you're in town?

1226
01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:37.822
Fun? In Toronto?

1227
01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.166
That's it! You cocky cock!

1228
01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:43.869
You'll pay for your crimes against humanity.

ENVY: Didn't you know?

1233
01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:03.722
Todd's vegan.

1234
01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:09.068
(COUGHING)

1235
01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:10.562
Vegan?

1236
01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:13.865
It's not really that big of a deal.

1237
01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:16.909
No kidding.

1238
01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:20.405
Anyone can be vegan.

1239
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:23.333
Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.

1240
01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:24.626
Ovo-what?

1241
01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:29.465
I partake not in the meat,
nor the breast milk, nor the ovum

1242
01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:31.633
of any creature with a face.

1243
01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:32.880
ENVY: Short answer,

1244
01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:35.463
being vegan
just makes you better than most people.

1245
01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:36.638
Bingo.

STEPHEN: Hey, man, question.

1248
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:46.269
I always wondered, how does not eating
dairy products give you psychic powers?

1249
01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:47.891
Okay.

1250
01:05:47.986 --> 01:05:50.353
You know how you only use
10% of your brain?

1251
01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.734
That's because the other 90%
is filled with curds and whey.

1252
01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:54.906
Did you learn that at Vegan Academy?

1253
01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:56.404
Go ahead and get snippy, baby.

1254
01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:58.952
If you knew the science,
maybe I'd listen to a word you're saying.

I just got wet from the rain?

1257
01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:07.664
It's not raining.

1258
01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:08.745
Oh.

1259
01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:10.623
Then why don't you give me the Cliff Notes

1260
01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:13.334
on how and why you ended up
dating this A-hole.

1261
01:06:13.428 --> 01:06:14.759
Is that really important right now?

1262
01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:16.757
Well, if there's a key element
in his backstory

1263
01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:20.136
that's gonna help me out
in a critical moment of not dying, yes.

1264
01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:25.221
I was only dating Lucas
until the minute Todd walked by.

1265
01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:29.517
<i>Guess that's not very nice,
but I used to be, kind of like that.</i>

1266
01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:33.612
We hated everyone. We wrecked stuff.
Nobody cared.

1267
01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.860
He punched a hole in the moon for me.

1268
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.782
It was pretty crazy.

1269
01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:41.612
A week and a half later he told me his dad
was sending him to Vegan Academy,

1270
01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:43.037
so I dumped him.

1271
01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.907
Have you dumped
everyone you've ever been with?

1272
01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:47.834
You've never been the dumpee?

1273
01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:51.039
Look, I've dabbled in being a bitch.

1274
01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:52.918
It's part of the reason I moved here.

1275
01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:56.297
I was really hoping
to just leave it all behind me.

1276

TODD: Hey, lovebirds...

1277
01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:01.052
We have unfinished business, I and he.

1278
01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:02.966
He and me.

1279
01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:04.517
Don't you talk to me about grammar.

1280
01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:06.470
I dislike you, capisce?

1281
01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:08.305
Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.

1282
01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:09.480
What?

1283
01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.057
Because you'll be dust by Monday.

1284
01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:12.771
Um...

1285
01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.899
Because you'll be pulverized in two seconds.

1286
01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:18.232
And the cleaning lady, she cleans up dust.

1287
01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.404
She dusts.

1288
01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:23.991
So, what's on Monday?

1289
01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:29.160
Because it's Friday now.
She has the weekends off, so...

1290
01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:31.711
Monday. Right?

1291
01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:33.713
Basically, you can't win this fight.

1292
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.168
You're gonna have to give up this girl,
because Todd's gonna kill you.

Fair trade blend with soy milk?

(SCOFFS) I'm sorry, but that's pathetic.

1306

Dude, I can see in your mind's eye.

1307
01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:43.251
You put half-and-half
into one of those coffees

1308
01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:45.553
in an attempt to make me break vegan edge.

1309
01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.426
I'll take the one with soy.

1310
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:52.055
Thanks, tool.

1311
01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:56.648
Actually, muchacho,
I poured the soy in this cup.

1312
01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:59.567
But I thought real hard
about pouring it in that cup.

1313
01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:02.567
You know, in my mind's eye or whatever.

1314
01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:05.106
What are you talking about?

1315
01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.612
You just drank half-and-half, baby.

1316
01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:09.740
Freeze! Vegan police!

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:10.992

Todd Ingram, you're under arrest
for veganity violation,

code number 827,
imbibement of half-and-half.

That's bullroar!

No vegan diet, no vegan powers!

1322
01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:25.044
But it's only my first offense.
Don't I get three strikes? I mean...

1323
01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:26.503
Take it.

1324
01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:31.517
At 12:27 am. on February 1st,
you knowingly ingested gelato.

1325
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:33.385
Gelato isn't vegan?

1326
01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:34.890
It's milk and eggs, bitch.

1327
01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:38.099

you partook a plate of chicken parmesan.

No. No.

YOU once were a vegone,

1335

I am so pissed off for you, right now.

Shut the (BLEEP) up, Julie.

1348
01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:16.659
Okay.

1349
01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:19.495
We're still going to the after-party, right?

1350
01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:21.371
KIM: I'm not sure
there's going to be much of a party.

1351
01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:23.123
I think a third of the band just went "poom."

1352
01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:25.831
Yeah, cool bands never go
to their own after-parties.

1353
01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:28.667
Just the desperate people
trying to rub elbows with the label guys.

1354

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:34.260

1357
01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:36.383
You wanna go?

1358
01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:39.765
Well, I kind of almost died back there.

1359
01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:42.097
- I'm not saying I want to go.
- Yeah. We can totally go.

1360
01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:44.273
- I'll do whatever you want to do.
- So, let's go.

RAMONA: We really don't
have to go to this thing.

1362
01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:49.107
It'll probably be a bad scene all around.

1363
01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:51.690
No, I'm fine. It's just...

1364
01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:53.240
- It's just...
- Well...

1365
01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:57.491
Have you ever dated someone
that wasn't a total ass?

1366
01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:59.323
So far, you're not a total ass.

1367
01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:00.578
But I'm part ass?

1368
01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:02.784
If it makes you feel better,
you're the nicest guy I've dated.

1369
01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:03.869
Wait, is that good?

1370
01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:05.124
It's what I need right now.

1371
01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:06.204
But not later?

1372
01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.131
Scott, I don't have all the answers, okay?

1373
01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.925
I'd just like to try and live in the moment
if I can.

1374
01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:12.594
I'd just like to live.

1375
01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:16.013
RAMONA: Look, I know Todd was bad news,
but are you saying Envy wasn't?

1376
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.431
We all have baggage.

1377
01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:20.556
Well, my baggage doesn't try and kill me
every five minutes.

1378
01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:22.512
What did you do to make
your ex-boyfriend so insane?

1379
01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:23.893
- Exes.
- Whatever.

1380
01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.145
No breakup is painless,
somebody always gets hurt.

1381
01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:28.772
What about you and that girl, Knives?
Who broke up with who?

1382
01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:31.446

01:44:55.164 --> 01:44:58.327
GIDEON: Scott Pilgrim.

1906
01:44:59.418 --> 01:45:00.579
(GIDEON CHUCKLING)

1907
01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:04.208
You can defeat me, Scott,

1908
01:45:04.673 --> 01:45:08.211
but can you defeat yourself?

1909
01:45:13.599 --> 01:45:14.839
KNIVES: Uh-oh!

1910
01:45:15.684 --> 01:45:16.845
Nega Scott.

1911
01:45:16.977 --> 01:45:18.513
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Nega Scott!

1912
01:45:22.566 --> 01:45:23.806
No.

1913
01:45:24.026 --> 01:45:25.937
This is something I have to face.

1914
01:45:29.198 --> 01:45:30.313
Myself.

1915
01:45:32.451 --> 01:45:34.692
Solo round!

1916
01:45:36.121 --> 01:45:39.614
SCOTT: They have this incredible
French toast with bananas on it

1917
01:45:39.708 --> 01:45:40.914
and you get bacon on the side.

1918
01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:42.116
I'm liking that.

1919
01:45:42.211 --> 01:45:43.872
- Let's do it next week.
- Yeah, Tuesday.

1920
01:45:43.963 --> 01:45:46.250
- Yeah, all right. Be good.
- Yeah, yeah.

1921
01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:47.625
Hey.

1922
01:45:47.716 --> 01:45:48.956
(NEGA SCOTT WHISTLING)

1923
01:45:49.051 --> 01:45:50.462
What happened?

1924
01:45:50.553 --> 01:45:53.466
Nothing, we just shot the shit.
He's just a really nice guy.

1925
01:45:53.556 --> 01:45:57.140
We're gonna get brunch next week.
We actually have a lot in common.

1926
01:45:57.226 --> 01:46:00.218
Your hair, it's getting really shaggy.

1927
01:46:00.813 --> 01:46:02.520
- It is?
- Yeah.

1928
01:46:03.941 --> 01:46:06.228
You should probably get it cut.

1929
01:46:07.069 --> 01:46:08.525
Yeah, you're right.

1930
01:46:08.779 --> 01:46:09.985
I should get it cut.

1931
01:46:10.072 --> 01:46:11.562
At a salon.

1932
01:46:11.657 --> 01:46:13.989
Salon, yeah. That sounds really nice.

1933
01:46:14.076 --> 01:46:15.487
Hey.

1934
01:46:16.787 --> 01:46:18.027
You're going?

1935
01:46:18.581 --> 01:46:20.538
I should probably disappear.

1936
01:46:20.958 --> 01:46:22.323
After all that?

1937
01:46:23.085 --> 01:46:25.076
I still need a new life.

1938
01:46:25.921 --> 01:46:29.414
I came here to escape,
but the past keeps catching up.

1939
01:46:30.384 --> 01:46:32.500
I'm tired of people getting hurt
because of me.

1940
01:46:32.595 --> 01:46:34.927
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get over it.

1941
01:46:35.598 --> 01:46:37.589
I don't mean just you.

1942
01:46:40.436 --> 01:46:42.143
SCOTT: I understand.

1943
01:46:43.981 --> 01:46:45.722
I should thank you, though.

1944
01:46:45.816 --> 01:46:47.227
For what?

1945
01:46:49.361 --> 01:46:52.319
For being the nicest guy I ever dated.

1946
01:46:54.325 --> 01:46:56.111
That's kind of sad.

1947
01:46:58.662 --> 01:47:00.448
It is kind of sad.

1948
01:47:03.792 --> 01:47:05.282
Bye, and stuff.

1949
01:47:06.503 --> 01:47:09.916
Yeah. And stuff.

1950
01:47:15.304 --> 01:47:17.215
KNIVES: Go, get her.

1951
01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:19.596
SCOTT: What?

1952
01:47:19.683 --> 01:47:22.425
You've been fighting for her all along.

1953
01:47:24.730 --> 01:47:26.141
But what about you?

1954
01:47:26.982 --> 01:47:28.768
I'll be fine.

1955
01:47:32.905 --> 01:47:35.442
I'm too cool for you anyway.

1956
01:47:39.912 --> 01:47:41.152
Ciao, Knives.

1957
01:47:41.914 --> 01:47:43.075
Go.

1958
01:47:48.712 --> 01:47:49.952
SCOTT: Hey.

1959
01:47:50.047 --> 01:47:52.414
Hey, mind if I tag along?

1960
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:56.671
You want to come with me?

1961
01:47:56.845 --> 01:48:00.964
Yeah, I thought maybe we could try again.

1962
01:48:24.623 --> 01:48:29.709
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Continue? Nine, eight, seven, six,

1963
01:48:29.795 --> 01:48:34.255
five, four, three, two, one.
