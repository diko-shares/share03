1
00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:41.082
The year, 1462.

2
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.460
Constantinople had fallen.

3
00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:48.423
Moslem Turks swept into Europe
with a vast, superior force...

4
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.635
...striking at Romania,
threatening all of Christendom.

5
00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:55.263
From Transylvania
arose a Romanian knight...

6
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:59.684
...of the Sacred Order of the Dragon,
known as Dracula.

7
00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:18.077
On the eve of the battle...

8
00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:20.955
...his bride, Elisabeta...

9
00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:24.250
...whom he prized
above all things on Earth...

10
00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:28.504
...knew that he must face
an insurmountable force...

11
00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:32.341
...from which he might never return.

12
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:33.986
God be praised.
I am victorious.

13
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.706
Elisabeta.

14
00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:52.380
The vengeful Turks
shot an arrow into the castle...

15
00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:55.758
...carrying false news
of Dracula's death.

16
00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:58.594
Elisabeta, believing him dead...

17
00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:01.681
...flung herself into the river.

18
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.847
My prince is dead.

19
00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:45.099
All is lost without him.

20
00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:48.019
May God unite us in heaven.

21
00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.619
She has taken her own life.

22
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.580
Her soul cannot be saved.

23
00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:09.832
She is damned.

24
00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:12.793
It is God's law.

25
00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:25.389
Is this my reward
for defending God's church?

26
00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:26.557
Sacrilege!

27
00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:30.353
I renounce God!

28
00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:34.857
I shall rise from my own death...

29
00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:39.612
...to avenge hers
with all the powers of darkness.

30
00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.424
The blood is the life...

31
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.388
...and it shall be mine!

32
00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:04.405
I've done everything
that you asked, master.

33
00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:09.535
All the preparations
are in order.

34
00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:11.328
Everything.

35
00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:14.206
I await your command.

36
00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.959
For I know...

37
00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:20.296
...that when the rewards
are given...

38
00:06:20.464 --> 00:06:24.091
...I will be one of those
who benefits from your generosity.

39
00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:31.265
Thank you.

40
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.728
Gone mad.
Renfield is deranged.

41
00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:39.732
He's lost his greedy mind,
poor chap.

42
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.318
I want you to take over
for his foreign client...

43
00:06:42.486 --> 00:06:44.528
...this rather eccentric
Count Dracula.

44
00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:47.865
- He's buying up property in London.
- Of course, sir.

45
00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.826
I'll attend to the count.
Thank you for your confidence.

46
00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.996
This is a great opportunity
for you, Harker.

47
00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:57.291
But you'll have to leave
for Transylvania immediately.

48
00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:01.003
Opportunities such as this
come but once in a lifetime.

49
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:03.506
Yes, of course, sir.

50
00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.174
If I may inquire...

51
00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:08.094
...what, in fact, happened
to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

52
00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:11.263
Nothing. Nothing.

53
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.307
Personal problems.

54
00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.309
Close these transactions...

55
00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:18.604
...and your future with this firm
is assured.

56
00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:21.690
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

57
00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:28.322
We've waited this long,
haven't we?

58
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.699
We can be married when I return.

59
00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.036
Of course.

60
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.580
I'll write.

61
00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.333
Jonathan.

62
00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:45.881
Jonathan, I love you.

63
00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.925
I love you, Mina.

64
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.749
25th May, Budapest.

65
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.252
Left Budapest early this morning.

66
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.130
The impression I had
was that we were leaving the west...

67
00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:28.716
...and entering the east.

68
00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:32.761
The district I am to enter
is in the extreme east of the country...

69
00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.597
...just on the borders
of three states...

70
00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:37.349
...Transylvania, Moldavia
and Bukovina...

71
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.602
...in the midst
of the Carpathian Mountains...

72
00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:43.189
...one of the wildest
and least known portions of Europe.

73
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.402
"My friend...

74
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.780
...welcome to the Carpathians.

75
00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:55.117
I am anxiously expecting you.

76
00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.244
At the Borgo Pass...

77
00:08:57.412 --> 00:09:01.040
...my carriage will await you
and bring you to me.

78
00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:06.003
I trust your journey from London
has been a happy one...

79
00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.964
...and that you
will enjoy your stay...

80
00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:12.218
...in my beautiful land.

81
00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:16.263
Your friend, D."

82
00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:27.316
Diary, 25th May.

83
00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:30.819
My Jonathan has been gone
almost a week.

84
00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:34.782
And although I was disappointed we
could not marry before his departure...

85
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.160
...I am happy that he got sent
on this important assignment.

86
00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:41.163
I am longing to hear
all the news.

87
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:45.167
It must be so nice
to see strange countries.

88
00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:48.462
I wonder if we--
I mean Jonathan and I...

89
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.714
...shall ever see them together.

90
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:08.357
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

91
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.652
For the dead travel fast.

92
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.938
I say, is the castle far?

93
00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:51.520
Welcome to my home.

94
00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.731
Enter freely of your own will...

95
00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.818
...and leave some of
the happiness you bring.

96
00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.778
Count Dracula?

97
00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.822
I am...

98
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.949
...Dracula.

99
00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:07.870
And I bid you welcome,
Mr. Harker, to my house.

100
00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.374
Come in.

101
00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:32.019
You will, I trust,
excuse me that I...

102
00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.396
...do not join you.

103
00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.943
But I have already dined.

104
00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.739
And I never drink...

105
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.327
...wine.

106
00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:56.585
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

107
00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:01.590
The Order of the Dracul.

108
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.178
The Dragon.

109
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.722
An ancient society...

110
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.476
...pledging my forefathers...

111
00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:16.772
...to defend their church
against all enemies of Christ.

112
00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:23.820
That relationship
was not entirely...

113
00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:26.281
...successful.

114
00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.201
Oh, yes.

115
00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:36.124
It is no laughing matter.

116
00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:42.881
We Draculs
have a right to be proud.

117
00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.968
What devil or witch
was ever so great as Attila...

118
00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:49.471
...whose blood flows
in these veins?

119
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.894
Blood...

120
00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:04.820
...is too precious a thing
in these times.

121
00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:13.495
The warlike days are over.

122
00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:18.667
The victories of my great race...

123
00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.587
...are but a tale to be told.

124
00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:28.677
I am the last of my kind.

125
00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:34.391
I have offended you
with my ignorance, Count.

126
00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:36.977
Forgive me.

127
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.618
I do so long to go
through the crowded streets...

128
00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.037
...of your mighty London...

129
00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:59.875
...to be in the midst of the whirl
and the rush of humanity...

130
00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:02.377
...to share its life...

131
00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:05.547
...its changes, its death.

132
00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:09.134
There. You, Count, are--

133
00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:14.222
Are the owner of
Carfax Abbey at Purfleet.

134
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.558
Congratulations.

135
00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:19.478
Your firm writes most highly...

136
00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:20.979
...of your talents.

137
00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:24.941
They say you are a man of good...

138
00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:26.610
...taste.

139
00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:31.073
And that you are
a worthy substitute...

140
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:36.036
...to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

141
00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:38.830
You may rely on me, Count.

142
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:41.708
Forgive my curiosity,
but why ten houses...

143
00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:44.086
...in such precise locations
around London?

144
00:16:44.712 --> 00:16:47.339
Is it to raise the market value?

145
00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:52.594
Do you believe in destiny?

146
00:16:55.473 --> 00:17:00.102
That even the powers of time...

147
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:03.522
...can be altered
for a single purpose?

148
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.283
The luckiest man
who walks on this Earth...

149
00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:18.620
...is the one who finds...

150
00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:21.039
...true love.

151
00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.917
You found Mina.

152
00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:26.420
I thought she was lost.

153
00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:29.756
We're to be married
as soon as I return.

154
00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:31.967
Are you married, Count?

155
00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:34.428
Sir...

156
00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.471
...are you married?

157
00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:40.726
I was married once.

158
00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:43.145
Ages ago, it seems.

159
00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:46.314
She died.

160
00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.110
I'm very sorry.

161
00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:52.154
She was fortunate.

162
00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:58.326
My life, at its best, is misery.

163
00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:05.876
She will no doubt
make a devoted wife.

164
00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:09.838
And you a faithful husband.

165
00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:14.885
Come.

166
00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:18.680
Write now, my friend,
to your firm...

167
00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:22.726
...and to any loved ones,
and say that it shall please you...

168
00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:24.936
...to stay with me...

169
00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.105
...until a month from now.

170
00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:30.233
A month?

171
00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.528
Do you wish me to stay so long?

172
00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:40.202
I will take no refusal.

173
00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:55.050
Diary, 30th of May, 1897.

174
00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:59.805
I know Jonathan does not want me to
stay here with Lucy while he is away.

175
00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:04.226
He thinks that if I become accustomed
to the wealth of the Westenra family...

176
00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:08.230
...I will not be content as the wife
of a mere clerk in a law firm.

177
00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:11.107
But Lucy and I have been friends
since we were children...

178
00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:14.444
...and she has never minded
that I am only a schoolmistress.

179
00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:25.914
How disgustingly awful.

180
00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.168
Mina!

181
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.927
Oh, Mina, you're always working.

182
00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:42.264
Is your ambitious Jon Harker...

183
00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:45.100
...forcing you to learn
that ridiculous machine?

184
00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:48.436
When he could be forcing you
to perform...

185
00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:52.774
...unspeakable acts of desperate
passion on the parlor floor.

186
00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.442
Lucy, really.

187
00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.445
You shouldn't talk about
my fiancé in such a way.

188
00:19:57.613 --> 00:20:00.031
There's more to marriage
than carnal pleasure.

189
00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:05.120
Oh, Mina. So I see.

190
00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:07.706
Much, much more.

191
00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:11.793
That's--

192
00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.631
What is it, Lucy?

193
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:19.301
Because I don't understand it.

194
00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:22.178
Can a man and woman really do...

195
00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.139
...that?

196
00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:26.808
I did, only last night.

197
00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.728
- Fibber. You did not.
- Yes, I did.

198
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.982
Well, in my dreams.

199
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.985
Jonathan measures up,
doesn't he?

200
00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:39.029
You can tell Lucy.

201
00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.616
We've kissed. That's all.

202
00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:45.493
He thinks he's too poor
to marry me.

203
00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:50.332
And it's all the worse now that
I'm here visiting you at Hillingham...

204
00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:52.125
...my rich friend.

205
00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:55.754
Yes, but not even
one marriage proposal.

206
00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:58.214
And here I am, almost 20...

207
00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:00.675
...practically a hag.

208
00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:09.351
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

209
00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:14.439
- Oh, look.
- What is that?

210
00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:16.816
A Texan.

211
00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:19.027
Quincey P. Morris.

212
00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:21.947
He's so young and fresh...

213
00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:24.324
...like a wild stallion
between my legs.

214
00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:26.451
You're positively indecent.

215
00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:29.079
I just know what men desire.

216
00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.872
Watch.

217
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.625
- Quincey, darling.
- Miss Lucy.

218
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.628
Why, you're as fresh
as the spring rain.

219
00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.713
Oh, thank you.

220
00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:45.220
Please let me touch it.

221
00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:49.265
It's so big.

222
00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:53.812
Little girl.

223
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.148
Oh, my dear,
sweet little girl.

224
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.401
I hold your hand...

225
00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:01.820
- ...and you've kissed me.
- Jack!

226
00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:06.700
Oceans of love--
Oh, Jack, my darling.

227
00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:08.493
Poor little baby.

228
00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:10.537
My kitten, come over here.

229
00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:12.872
Come over here
and I'll kiss it better.

230
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.250
My poor little blossom.

231
00:22:15.418 --> 00:22:18.503
My poor little doctor.
Brilliant doctor.

232
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:20.505
- Hello, Quincey.
- Jack.

233
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:22.924
What a naughty bear.
Let me--

234
00:22:23.092 --> 00:22:26.261
- Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.
- Arthur!

235
00:22:27.013 --> 00:22:29.389
Oh, my darling.

236
00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.975
Oh, you look wonderful.

237
00:22:32.143 --> 00:22:34.936
I'm so sorry about your hat.

238
00:22:35.104 --> 00:22:36.938
- Charming.
- It's my snake dress.

239
00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:38.398
Is it really?

240
00:22:38.566 --> 00:22:41.276
Lucy is a pure
and virtuous girl...

241
00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:45.447
...but I admit that her free way
of speaking shocks me sometimes.

242
00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:48.616
Jonathan says it is a defect
of the aristocracy...

243
00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:50.994
...that they say what they please.

244
00:22:51.162 --> 00:22:56.291
The truth is that I admire Lucy. I'm not
surprised that men flock around her.

245
00:22:56.459 --> 00:22:59.335
I wish I were as pretty
and as adored as she.

246
00:23:17.438 --> 00:23:20.148
What manner of man is this?

247
00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:22.776
R.M. Renfield,
successful solicitor...

248
00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:25.612
...in the firm of Hawkins
and Thompkins...

249
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.740
...respected member of
the Lord Nugent's Windem Club...

250
00:23:28.908 --> 00:23:33.286
...returns from business abroad
in Transylvania...

251
00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:36.414
...promptly suffers
a complete mental breakdown.

252
00:23:36.582 --> 00:23:39.834
He's now obsessed
with some blood lust.

253
00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:45.507
George.

254
00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:49.803
Wait here.

255
00:23:57.019 --> 00:24:00.063
Would you care for
an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward...

256
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:02.899
...or a canapé?

257
00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:06.611
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.
How are you feeling tonight?

258
00:24:07.863 --> 00:24:10.365
Far better than you,
my lovesick doctor.

259
00:24:10.533 --> 00:24:12.367
Is my personal life
of interest to you?

260
00:24:12.535 --> 00:24:16.412
Of course it is.
All life interests me.

261
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.457
Your diet, Mr. Renfield,
is disgusting.

262
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:23.044
Actually,
they're perfectly nutritious.

263
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:26.005
You see,
each life that I ingest...

264
00:24:26.173 --> 00:24:28.383
...gives back life to me.

265
00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:34.848
A fly gives you life?

266
00:24:35.015 --> 00:24:36.724
Certainly.

267
00:24:36.892 --> 00:24:40.895
But you might as well ask a man to eat
molecules with a pair of chopsticks...

268
00:24:41.063 --> 00:24:43.815
...than to interest me
in a lesser carnivore.

269
00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:47.527
I shall have to invent a new
classification of lunatic for you.

270
00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:52.907
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

271
00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:56.578
Yes, spiders eat them.

272
00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:59.080
What about sparrows?

273
00:24:59.248 --> 00:25:02.584
Oh, yes.
Did you say sparrows?

274
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:06.921
- Something larger, perhaps?
- Oh, yes.

275
00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:10.383
A kitten.

276
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:12.093
I beg you.

277
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:15.221
A little, sleek-- A playful kitten.

278
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:18.683
Something I can teach.
Something I can feed.

279
00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:20.685
No one would refuse me a kitten.

280
00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:23.146
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

281
00:25:25.316 --> 00:25:26.941
Oh, yes.

282
00:25:27.109 --> 00:25:29.152
A big cat.

283
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.280
- My salvation depends upon it!
- Your salvation?

284
00:25:32.448 --> 00:25:34.449
Yes. I need lives.

285
00:25:34.617 --> 00:25:37.827
- I need lives for the master.
- What master?

286
00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:42.957
The master will come...

287
00:25:44.043 --> 00:25:47.128
...and he has promised
to make me immortal.

288
00:25:47.296 --> 00:25:48.838
How?

289
00:25:50.424 --> 00:25:52.133
Get him off!

290
00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:55.845
The blood is the life!

291
00:25:56.931 --> 00:25:59.015
The blood is the life!

292
00:26:00.768 --> 00:26:03.436
30th May, Castle Dracula.

293
00:26:03.604 --> 00:26:07.899
I think strange things which
I dare not confess to my own soul.

294
00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:09.400
The count...

295
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:12.987
...the way he looked at Mina's picture
fills me with dread...

296
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:16.032
...as if I have a part to play
in a story that is not known to me.

297
00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:42.267
I didn't hear you come in.

298
00:26:45.729 --> 00:26:48.815
Take care how you cut yourself.

299
00:26:48.983 --> 00:26:52.360
It is more dangerous
than you think.

300
00:26:58.701 --> 00:27:03.705
A foul bauble of man's vanity.

301
00:27:03.872 --> 00:27:06.207
Perhaps you should...

302
00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:08.543
...grow a beard.

303
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:18.886
The letters I requested.

304
00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:21.264
Have you written them?

305
00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:39.324
Good.

306
00:27:48.459 --> 00:27:51.836
Should you leave these rooms...

307
00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:55.423
...you will not, by any chance...

308
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:58.885
...go to sleep in any other
part of the castle.

309
00:28:00.596 --> 00:28:02.805
It is old...

310
00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:06.934
...and has many bad memories.

311
00:28:08.979 --> 00:28:12.607
- Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

312
00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:25.203
Do not put your faith
in such trinkets of deceit.

313
00:28:26.914 --> 00:28:29.665
We are in Transylvania.

314
00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:34.712
Transylvania is not England.

315
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.049
Our ways are not your ways.

316
00:28:38.217 --> 00:28:40.218
And to you...

317
00:28:40.386 --> 00:28:43.638
...there shall be
many strange things.

318
00:28:43.806 --> 00:28:47.058
I've seen many
strange things already.

319
00:28:47.226 --> 00:28:50.436
Bloody wolves chasing me
through some blue inferno!

320
00:28:55.859 --> 00:28:58.653
Listen to them.

321
00:29:03.033 --> 00:29:06.035
The children of the night.

322
00:29:07.955 --> 00:29:10.331
What sweet music they make.

323
00:29:10.499 --> 00:29:13.543
Music? Those animals?

324
00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:51.914
I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.

325
00:29:52.082 --> 00:29:55.543
To the firm, to my family
and to my beloved Mina.

326
00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:58.629
I said nothing of my fears
as he will read them, no doubt.

327
00:30:04.011 --> 00:30:06.471
I know now that I am a prisoner.

328
00:31:31.932 --> 00:31:33.641
Jonathan.

329
00:31:34.935 --> 00:31:37.186
Jonathan, come to me.

330
00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:48.656
Come.

331
00:32:07.134 --> 00:32:08.884
Lay down.

332
00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.221
Lay back into my arms.

333
00:32:21.857 --> 00:32:24.233
Lay back, Jonathan.

334
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:29.150
How dare you touch him!
He belongs to me!

335
00:34:29.735 --> 00:34:31.652
You yourself never loved.

336
00:34:34.865 --> 00:34:39.493
Yes. I too can love.

337
00:34:41.663 --> 00:34:45.708
And I shall love again.

338
00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:56.927
Are we to have nothing tonight?

339
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:43.724
"Dearest Mina,
all is well here.

340
00:35:43.892 --> 00:35:46.727
The count has insisted
I remain for a month...

341
00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:49.104
...to tutor him in English custom.

342
00:35:49.272 --> 00:35:52.650
I can say no more,
except I love you.

343
00:35:52.818 --> 00:35:55.569
Ever faithful, Jonathan."

344
00:35:58.907 --> 00:36:02.576
The letters I have written
have undoubtedly sealed my doom.

345
00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:10.251
The count's gypsies, fearless warriors
who are loyal to the death...

346
00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:12.628
...to whatever nobleman they serve...

347
00:36:15.465 --> 00:36:19.093
...day and night they toil,
filling boxes with decrepit earth...

348
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:22.513
...from the bowels of the castle.

349
00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:28.143
They are to be delivered to his newly
acquired Carfax Abbey in London.

350
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:34.108
Why do they
fill these boxes with earth?

351
00:36:39.281 --> 00:36:41.866
I love him! I love him!

352
00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:47.913
It's so wonderful.
I've decided.

353
00:36:48.081 --> 00:36:50.541
I love him
and I've said yes.

354
00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:54.128
Finally. Don't tell me.
The Texan with the big knife?

355
00:36:54.296 --> 00:36:57.131
Oh, no.
To my dear number three.

356
00:36:57.299 --> 00:37:01.260
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
Lord and Lady Holmwood.

357
00:37:01.428 --> 00:37:04.138
You are to be my maid of honor.
Oh, say yes.

358
00:37:04.306 --> 00:37:08.559
Mina, what is it?
It's the most exciting day of my life.

359
00:37:10.145 --> 00:37:12.146
You don't seem to care.

360
00:37:12.314 --> 00:37:15.399
It's just that I'm
so terribly worried about Jonathan.

361
00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:17.735
This letter I received is so--

362
00:37:17.903 --> 00:37:21.322
It's so cold. It's so unnatural.
It's not like him at all.

363
00:37:22.365 --> 00:37:24.366
Mina, don't worry.

364
00:37:51.144 --> 00:37:53.020
Captain's log: the Demeter.

365
00:37:53.188 --> 00:37:54.521
27th June, 1897.

366
00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.362
We picked up 50 boxes
of experimental earth...

367
00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:03.781
...bound for London, England.

368
00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:06.116
Set sail at noon into a storm...

369
00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:08.786
...that seemed
to come out of nowhere...

370
00:38:08.954 --> 00:38:11.372
...carrying us out to sea.

371
00:38:46.449 --> 00:38:50.077
Third of July.
Second mate has gone missing.

372
00:38:50.245 --> 00:38:54.665
Nearing Gibraltar.
Storm continues. Crew uneasy.

373
00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:58.419
Believe someone or something...

374
00:38:58.586 --> 00:39:01.213
...is aboard the ship with us.

375
00:39:13.893 --> 00:39:16.145
Master, I am here!

376
00:39:17.105 --> 00:39:20.107
The master of all life is at hand!

377
00:39:20.275 --> 00:39:22.192
Gather round!

378
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.778
I am here to do
your bidding, master!

379
00:39:24.946 --> 00:39:27.281
I have worshiped you
long and far off!

380
00:39:27.449 --> 00:39:30.909
And now you are near, master!

381
00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:33.662
I am your slave!

382
00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.457
I await your command!

383
00:39:36.624 --> 00:39:39.334
The case of Renfield
grows more interesting.

384
00:39:39.502 --> 00:39:43.297
Yet, there is method in his madness
with his flies and spiders.

385
00:39:43.465 --> 00:39:46.633
Had I the secret of even
one such brilliant mind...

386
00:39:46.801 --> 00:39:50.637
...the key to the fancy
of one lunatic....

387
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.020
Lucy.

388
00:40:56.538 --> 00:40:58.914
Lucy? Lucy!

389
00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:42.976
No. Do not see me.

390
00:42:58.493 --> 00:43:01.578
Oh! I couldn't control myself.

391
00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:05.540
Hush, Lucy. You're dreaming.
You're walking in your sleep again.

392
00:43:05.708 --> 00:43:09.711
My soul,
it seemed to leave my body.

393
00:43:09.879 --> 00:43:14.549
There was this agonizing feeling,
and I couldn't get back to it.

394
00:43:14.717 --> 00:43:16.134
I'm absolutely shaking.

395
00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:18.178
It's all right.
You were dreaming.

396
00:43:18.346 --> 00:43:21.556
I had to. It sort of
pulled me and lured me.

397
00:43:21.724 --> 00:43:24.851
- I had no control.
- It's all right.

398
00:43:25.019 --> 00:43:27.938
- It had red eyes.
- Hush now.

399
00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:31.149
I still have the taste
of his blood in my mouth.

400
00:43:44.747 --> 00:43:47.541
Here we go.
Swing it round here.

401
00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:51.003
Master.

402
00:43:52.338 --> 00:43:54.923
I am here to do your bidding.

403
00:43:56.009 --> 00:43:59.261
Master! I am here!

404
00:44:00.763 --> 00:44:03.056
I have worshiped you.

405
00:44:05.935 --> 00:44:08.770
Contrary to some beliefs,
the vampire...

406
00:44:08.938 --> 00:44:12.899
...like any other night creature,
can move about by day...

407
00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:17.404
...though it is not his natural time,
and his powers are weak.

408
00:44:34.005 --> 00:44:37.132
See the amazing cinematograph!

409
00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:40.260
A wonder of modern civilization!

410
00:44:40.428 --> 00:44:42.637
The latest sensation!

411
00:44:42.805 --> 00:44:45.849
The greatest attraction
of the century!

412
00:44:46.017 --> 00:44:48.769
The new wonder of the world!

413
00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:15.045
See me.

414
00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:18.131
See me now.

415
00:45:24.847 --> 00:45:28.100
Escaped wolf from zoo
still at large!

416
00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:30.143
Buy a paper, sir?

417
00:45:32.438 --> 00:45:33.980
Thank you, sir.

418
00:45:36.484 --> 00:45:39.986
Get your Gazette!
Penny a paper!

419
00:45:53.209 --> 00:45:55.752
My humblest apologies.

420
00:45:56.963 --> 00:45:59.840
Forgive my ignorance.

421
00:46:00.007 --> 00:46:03.009
I am recently arrived
from abroad...

422
00:46:03.177 --> 00:46:06.179
...and I do not know your city.

423
00:46:06.347 --> 00:46:10.267
- Is a beautiful lady--
- A street atlas is sixpence. Good day.

424
00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:15.105
I have offended you.

425
00:46:16.649 --> 00:46:18.900
I am only looking for
the cinematograph.

426
00:46:19.068 --> 00:46:22.529
I understand it is a wonder
of the civilized world.

427
00:46:22.697 --> 00:46:26.408
If you seek culture,
then visit a museum.

428
00:46:26.576 --> 00:46:29.494
London is filled with them.
Excuse me.

429
00:46:38.838 --> 00:46:41.465
A woman so lovely and intelligent...

430
00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:45.177
...should not be walking the streets
of London without her gentleman.

431
00:46:45.344 --> 00:46:47.554
Do I know you, sir?

432
00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:51.683
Are you acquainted
with my husband?

433
00:46:51.851 --> 00:46:53.727
Shall I call the police?

434
00:46:55.563 --> 00:46:57.731
Husband?

435
00:46:57.899 --> 00:47:00.317
I shall bother you no more.

436
00:47:04.071 --> 00:47:05.655
Sir.

437
00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:09.409
It is I who have been rude.

438
00:47:09.577 --> 00:47:12.412
- If you're looking--
- Please.

439
00:47:14.749 --> 00:47:17.334
Permit me to introduce myself.

440
00:47:19.212 --> 00:47:23.423
I am Prince Vlad of Sagite.

441
00:47:26.427 --> 00:47:28.428
- A prince, no less?
- I am...

442
00:47:30.056 --> 00:47:31.973
...your servant.

443
00:47:34.268 --> 00:47:36.853
Wilhelmina Murray.

444
00:47:39.815 --> 00:47:42.442
I am...

445
00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:44.611
...honored...

446
00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:46.696
...Madam Mina.

447
00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.452
This way.

448
00:48:05.675 --> 00:48:07.551
Hello, sir.

449
00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:10.971
Mr. Holmwood asked me
to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

450
00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:12.597
Yes, sir.

451
00:48:12.765 --> 00:48:15.433
- Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.
- Thank you.

452
00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:17.143
Oh, Jack!

453
00:48:17.311 --> 00:48:20.564
Brilliant Jack.
Do you like it?

454
00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:24.317
Did Arthur put you up to this...

455
00:48:24.485 --> 00:48:27.862
...or did you want me alone just once
before I'm married?

456
00:48:28.948 --> 00:48:31.449
Lucy, you're embarrassing me.

457
00:48:31.617 --> 00:48:34.327
I'm here as your doctor.

458
00:48:34.495 --> 00:48:36.663
Your fiancé
is very worried about you...

459
00:48:36.831 --> 00:48:41.626
...and I assure you,
a doctor's confidence is sacred.

460
00:48:41.794 --> 00:48:43.878
I must have your complete trust.

461
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:50.510
Help me, Jack.

462
00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:54.598
I don't know
what's happening to me.

463
00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:56.850
I'm changing.

464
00:48:57.018 --> 00:48:58.893
I can feel it.

465
00:49:00.438 --> 00:49:02.314
I can hear everything.

466
00:49:02.481 --> 00:49:05.483
I hear the servants at the other
end of the house, whispering.

467
00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:08.903
I hear mice in the attic,
stomping like elephants.

468
00:49:10.072 --> 00:49:12.741
But I'm having horrible
nightmares, Jack.

469
00:49:14.869 --> 00:49:16.369
The eyes.

470
00:49:16.537 --> 00:49:17.871
Oh, Jack.

471
00:49:18.039 --> 00:49:21.708
I'm here, Lucy.
Nothing will harm you.

472
00:49:24.712 --> 00:49:26.129
Let it work.

473
00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:30.383
- Thank you.
- Lucy.

474
00:49:30.551 --> 00:49:32.927
Oh, Jack, kiss me.

475
00:49:38.059 --> 00:49:40.894
And may I say, Miss Lucy
is hotter than a June bride...

476
00:49:41.062 --> 00:49:43.396
...riding bareback
buck naked in the Sahara.

477
00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:46.232
I would watch my colonial tongue
if I were you.

478
00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:51.321
Hello, Jack.
And how's our lovely patient today?

479
00:49:51.489 --> 00:49:55.200
Well, frankly, Arthur,
I'm confounded.

480
00:49:55.368 --> 00:49:57.994
Jack, are you still
brooding over Miss Lucy?

481
00:49:58.162 --> 00:50:01.665
I can only conclude
it must be something mental.

482
00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:05.251
How very droll.
Did you hear that, Quince?

483
00:50:05.419 --> 00:50:08.963
Last week he wanted to marry her, and
now he wants to have her committed.

484
00:50:10.383 --> 00:50:11.800
Let's have a look at her.

485
00:50:22.561 --> 00:50:25.563
I'm at a loss, I admit.

486
00:50:25.731 --> 00:50:28.316
I've taken the liberty
of cabling Abraham Van Helsing...

487
00:50:28.484 --> 00:50:30.443
...the metaphysician, philosopher.

488
00:50:30.611 --> 00:50:33.405
Sounds like a goddamn
witch doctor to me, Jack.

489
00:50:33.572 --> 00:50:37.367
Van Helsing knows more about obscure
diseases than any man in the world.

490
00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:39.703
He's my teacher and mentor.

491
00:50:42.623 --> 00:50:46.126
Do it, man.
Bring him here.

492
00:50:46.293 --> 00:50:48.253
Spare no expense.

493
00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:24.706
Astounding.

494
00:51:24.874 --> 00:51:27.667
There are no limits to science.

495
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.172
How can you call this science?

496
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:36.509
Do you think Madam Curie
would invite such comparisons?

497
00:51:36.677 --> 00:51:38.344
Really.

498
00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:44.726
I shouldn't have come here.

499
00:51:44.894 --> 00:51:46.811
I must go.

500
00:51:52.067 --> 00:51:54.027
Do not fear me.

501
00:52:09.168 --> 00:52:10.794
Stop this.

502
00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:12.545
Stop this.

503
00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:25.475
My God. Who are you?

504
00:52:25.643 --> 00:52:27.310
I know you.

505
00:52:27.478 --> 00:52:32.023
I have crossed oceans of time...

506
00:52:32.191 --> 00:52:34.067
...to find you.

507
00:53:13.148 --> 00:53:15.191
There is no need to panic.

508
00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:19.028
The animal handlers have
everything under complete control.

509
00:53:39.091 --> 00:53:41.134
Come here, Mina.

510
00:54:00.362 --> 00:54:01.988
He likes you.

511
00:54:28.182 --> 00:54:31.476
There is much to be learned
from beasts.

512
00:55:44.633 --> 00:55:46.801
The tropical pampas vampire bat
must...

513
00:55:46.969 --> 00:55:50.763
...consume ten times its own weight
in fresh blood each day...

514
00:55:51.807 --> 00:55:54.392
...or its own blood cells will die.

515
00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:05.445
Cute little vermin, ja?

516
00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:09.157
Blood and the diseases
of the blood...

517
00:56:09.324 --> 00:56:12.118
...such as syphilis,
they concern us here.

518
00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:15.455
The very name
"venereal diseases"...

519
00:56:15.622 --> 00:56:19.292
...the diseases of Venus,
imputes to them divine origin.

520
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:22.837
And they are involved
in that sex problem about which...

521
00:56:23.005 --> 00:56:27.050
...the ethics and ideals
of Christian civilization are concerned.

522
00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:32.305
In fact, civilization and syphilization
have advanced together.

523
00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:38.102
- What is this?
- It's from the telegraph, Professor.

524
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:40.146
Telegraph?

525
00:56:43.317 --> 00:56:46.486
Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you.
That will be all.

526
00:56:57.414 --> 00:56:59.499
Dawn.

527
00:56:59.666 --> 00:57:02.502
These may be the last words
I write in this journal.

528
00:57:02.669 --> 00:57:05.296
Dracula has left me
with these women...

529
00:57:05.464 --> 00:57:07.507
...these devils of the pit.

530
00:57:07.674 --> 00:57:09.842
They drain my blood
to keep me weak...

531
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:12.678
...barely alive so I cannot escape.

532
00:57:12.846 --> 00:57:16.182
I will try one last time today
to escape to the water.

533
00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:19.185
There must be passageway
to the river...

534
00:57:19.353 --> 00:57:21.771
...and then away
from this cursed land...

535
00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:25.108
...where the devil and his children
still walk with earthly feet.

536
00:57:35.369 --> 00:57:37.495
For the record, I do attest...

537
00:57:37.663 --> 00:57:40.873
that at this point,
I, Abraham Van Helsing...

538
00:57:41.041 --> 00:57:44.919
...became personally involved
in these strange events.

539
00:58:38.932 --> 00:58:41.934
Professor Van Helsing,
how good of you to come.

540
00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:49.901
I always come to my friends in need
when they call me.

541
00:58:50.068 --> 00:58:52.445
So, Jack, tell me everything
about your case.

542
00:58:52.613 --> 00:58:55.489
She has all the usual
physical anemic signs.

543
00:58:55.657 --> 00:58:58.784
Her blood analyzes normal,
and yet it is not.

544
00:58:58.952 --> 00:59:02.496
She manifests continued blood loss.
I cannot trace the cause.

545
00:59:02.664 --> 00:59:04.582
Blood loss? How?

546
00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:15.259
My God, close the doors!

547
00:59:26.855 --> 00:59:27.939
My God...

548
00:59:28.106 --> 00:59:30.191
...she's only a child.

549
00:59:31.818 --> 00:59:33.277
Ja.

550
00:59:34.613 --> 00:59:36.530
My God.

551
00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:40.701
There's no time to lose.
There must be a transfusion at once.

552
00:59:40.869 --> 00:59:43.496
Take off your coat.
Remember how to tie a tourniquet?

553
00:59:43.664 --> 00:59:45.998
- Or have you forgotten?
- You perfected a procedure?

554
00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:48.584
Perfected? No.
I've only experimented.

555
00:59:48.752 --> 00:59:50.670
Landsteiner's method.

556
00:59:52.506 --> 00:59:54.674
Animals, goats, sheeps.

557
00:59:56.343 --> 00:59:58.219
If hemolysis occurs
in the blood donor serum...

558
00:59:58.387 --> 01:00:00.054
...her red blood cells will explode.

559
01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:02.556
She will die.
Take this tube.

560
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.646
What in God's name
is going on up here?

561
01:00:08.814 --> 01:00:10.648
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.

562
01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:13.192
- What the hell is he doing to Lucy?
- He's trying to save her life.

563
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.903
- Good God!
- You're the fiancé? Please.

564
01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:22.410
Take off your coat.
This young lady's very ill. She's dying.

565
01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:24.578
She wants blood
and blood she must have.

566
01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:26.080
Take off your coat.

567
01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:28.165
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

568
01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:31.836
- Oh, God.
- Quickly, quickly.

569
01:00:32.004 --> 01:00:33.546
Roll it up!

570
01:00:33.714 --> 01:00:35.464
This may hurt a little, Art.

571
01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:50.730
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would
give my last drop of blood to save her.

572
01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:52.773
Your last drop?

573
01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:54.567
Thank you.

574
01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:59.071
You are very welcome here.
I don't ask as much as that. Not yet.

575
01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:00.656
Hold her hand.

576
01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:17.590
Jack, that poor creature has had the
blood of two men put into her already.

577
01:01:17.758 --> 01:01:21.177
Man alive. Her whole body
couldn't hold that much blood.

578
01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:27.600
- What took it out?
- That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

579
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:35.107
Those marks on her throat...

580
01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:37.651
...no disease, no trituration...

581
01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:39.653
...I am sure the blood loss
occurred there.

582
01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:41.739
Oh? Where did the blood go?

583
01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:45.576
You were once
a careful student, Jack.

584
01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:47.578
Use your brain!
Where did the blood go?

585
01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:49.121
Tell me!

586
01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:52.458
- The bed would be covered in blood.
- Exactly.

587
01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:55.044
You do not let your eyes see
nor your ears hear...

588
01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:57.463
...that which you cannot account for.

589
01:01:57.631 --> 01:02:01.634
Something just went up there,
sucked it out of her and flew away?

590
01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:04.970
Ja. Why not?

591
01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:09.350
That's brilliant.
That's absolutely brilliant.

592
01:02:09.518 --> 01:02:11.644
Will one of you learned doctors,
or whatever you are...

593
01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:13.771
...kindly tell me
what is going on with my Lucy?

594
01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:17.733
Jack, you are a scientist.

595
01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:21.237
Do you not think there are things in
this universe you cannot understand...

596
01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:23.864
...and which are true.
Mesmerism, hypnotism?

597
01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:26.117
You and Charcot
have proved hypnotism.

598
01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:27.701
Materialization, astral bodies.

599
01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:39.422
Professor?

600
01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:42.258
Where did he go?

601
01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:47.304
You see?

602
01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:49.849
I feel like a blundering novice.

603
01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:53.519
Gentlemen, we're not fighting
some disease here.

604
01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:55.688
Those marks on your dear
Miss Lucy's neck were made...

605
01:02:55.856 --> 01:02:58.023
...by something unspeakable
out there.

606
01:02:58.191 --> 01:02:59.358
Dead, but not dead.

607
01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:02.570
It stalks us for some dread purpose
I do not comprehend.

608
01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:05.823
To live, it feeds
on Lucy's precious blood.

609
01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:08.409
It is a beast, a monster.

610
01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:30.181
What is happening
to Lucy and to me?

611
01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:33.517
When I was younger,
my feelings were never troubled.

612
01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:35.978
I wish I were myself again...

613
01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:39.857
...the sensible Mina
I always depended on.

614
01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:48.365
Absinthe...

615
01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:50.993
...is the aphrodisiac of the self.

616
01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.414
The green fairy...

617
01:03:55.582 --> 01:04:00.294
...who lives in the absinthe...

618
01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:02.379
...wants your soul.

619
01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:06.592
But...

620
01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:10.930
...you are safe with me.

621
01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.947
Tell me, Prince...

622
01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:30.199
...tell me of your home.

623
01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:34.995
The most beautiful place...

624
01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:37.081
...in all creation.

625
01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:41.794
Yes, it must be.

626
01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:49.635
A land beyond
a great, vast forest...

627
01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.974
...surrounded by
majestic mountains...

628
01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.727
...lush vineyards...

629
01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:05.276
...and flowers of such frailty
and beauty...

630
01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:07.820
...as to be found nowhere else.

631
01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:19.582
You've described my home...

632
01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.917
...as if you had seen it firsthand.

633
01:05:26.006 --> 01:05:29.091
It's your voice, perhaps.

634
01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.176
It's so familiar.

635
01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.097
It's like--

636
01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:39.268
It's like a voice in a dream
I cannot place...

637
01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:44.773
...and it comforts me.

638
01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.401
- When I am alone.
- When you are alone.

639
01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.383
And what of the princess?

640
01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:19.725
Princess?

641
01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:21.810
There is always a princess...

642
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.398
...with gowns flowing white.

643
01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:33.697
And her face.

644
01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:36.867
Oh, God...

645
01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:38.911
...her face...

646
01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:44.249
...is a river.

647
01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:51.507
The princess...

648
01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:56.095
...she's a river
filled with tears of sadness...

649
01:06:57.597 --> 01:06:59.515
...and heartbreak.

650
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:05.729
There was a princess.

651
01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:11.193
Elisabeta.

652
01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.739
She was the most radiant woman...

653
01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:17.950
...in all the empires of the world.

654
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.128
Man's deceit took her
from her ancient prince.

655
01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:34.091
She leapt to her death...

656
01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:36.635
...into the river that you spoke of.

657
01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:40.639
In my mother's tongue...

658
01:07:42.142 --> 01:07:44.059
...it is called...

659
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:47.396
...argesh.

660
01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:51.400
River princess.

661
01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:29.122
Dear Madam.

662
01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:32.167
Your fiancé is safe and in the care...

663
01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:34.962
...of the good sisters
of the Blessed Sacrament.

664
01:09:36.422 --> 01:09:40.759
Mr. Harker believes your life
is in extreme danger...

665
01:09:40.927 --> 01:09:44.263
...and he desires with all urgency
that you join him here...

666
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:47.558
...so that you may
immediately be married.

667
01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:51.353
Yours with all blessings,
Sister Agatha.

668
01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:56.650
My sweet prince.

669
01:09:56.818 --> 01:09:59.444
Jonathan must never know of us.

670
01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:11.832
Dr. Van Helsing.

671
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.127
And you're Madam Mina,
dear friend to our Lucy, ja?

672
01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:18.463
- How is she, doctor?
- She's still very weak.

673
01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:20.883
She tells me of your
beloved Jonathan Harker...

674
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.135
...and your worry for him.

675
01:10:23.303 --> 01:10:25.470
Well, I, too, worry
for all young lovers.

676
01:10:30.018 --> 01:10:32.603
There are darknesses in life,
my child...

677
01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.813
...and there are lights.

678
01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:37.774
You are one of the lights,
dear Mina...

679
01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:39.985
...the light of all light.

680
01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.200
Go now.
See your friend.

681
01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:11.016
You look different.

682
01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:14.269
You look positively radiant.

683
01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:15.854
You heard from Jonathan.

684
01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:18.190
- Didn't you?
- Yes.

685
01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:21.860
He's safe.

686
01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:24.696
He's in a convent in Romania.

687
01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:28.283
He's suffering
from a violent brain fever.

688
01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:30.118
The good sisters
are caring for him.

689
01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:34.873
They wrote to me,
and they say he needs me...

690
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:38.043
...but I won't go.

691
01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:40.462
I'm not going to leave you.

692
01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:45.217
You've got to go to him...

693
01:11:45.385 --> 01:11:47.886
...and you've got to love him...

694
01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:50.222
...and marry him
right then and there.

695
01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:55.352
And I want you to take this,
my sister.

696
01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.437
It's my wedding gift to you.

697
01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.900
Don't worry about
spoiled little Lucy.

698
01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.697
I'll be all right.

699
01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:09.866
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

700
01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:26.550
Jack, how is she?

701
01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:48.405
This is why I cannot breathe!

702
01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:50.449
Lucy, it's medicinal.

703
01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:52.909
To help you sleep.
To dream better dreams.

704
01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:56.079
It's garlic!
It's nothing but common garlic!

705
01:12:56.247 --> 01:12:59.458
Quincey's here to see you.
Get some brandy.

706
01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:03.295
Now, Miss Lucy,
you just rest easy.

707
01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:05.297
Arthur sent me
to take care of you.

708
01:13:06.507 --> 01:13:07.883
He said
if you don't get better quick...

709
01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:11.053
...I have to put you out of your misery
like a lame horse.

710
01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:16.475
You're such a beast.

711
01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:21.730
Will you kiss me?

712
01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:27.235
Kiss me.

713
01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:38.663
- That old coot!
- Get off me!

714
01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:42.209
Listen to me!
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

715
01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:47.339
You're at peace.

716
01:13:47.507 --> 01:13:51.301
Look. There. There.

717
01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.223
Nosferatu.

718
01:14:10.196 --> 01:14:12.739
"Here occurs the shocking
and frightening history...

719
01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:16.827
...of the wild,
berserk Prince Dracula.

720
01:14:16.994 --> 01:14:19.204
How he impaled people
and roasted them...

721
01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:20.956
...boiled their heads in a kettle...

722
01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:23.375
...how he skinned them alive...

723
01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:27.212
...and hacked them to pieces
and then drank their blood."

724
01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:33.844
Dracul.

725
01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:36.555
For blood is the life.

726
01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:55.615
"My dearest Prince, forgive me.

727
01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:59.327
I have received word
from my fiancé in Romania.

728
01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:02.622
I am en route to join him.
We are to be married.

729
01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:06.251
I will never see you again.

730
01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:08.128
Mina."

731
01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:20.098
It is odd,
but I feel almost...

732
01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:22.893
...that my strange friend
is with me.

733
01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.896
He speaks to me in my thoughts.

734
01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:29.107
With him I felt more alive
than ever I had.

735
01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:32.110
And now without him,
soon to be a bride...

736
01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:34.988
...I feel confused and lost.

737
01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:39.159
Perhaps, though I try to be good,
I am bad.

738
01:15:39.327 --> 01:15:42.287
Perhaps I am a bad,
inconstant woman.

739
01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:02.766
Winds!

740
01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:15.820
It is the cause.

741
01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:18.657
It is the cause of my soul!

742
01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:20.200
It is Dracula...

743
01:16:20.368 --> 01:16:22.494
...the undead...

744
01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:25.664
...the foe I have pursued
all my life.

745
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:31.586
Dracula!

746
01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.591
Jack, hurry!
I have much to tell you.

747
01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:41.179
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

748
01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:43.765
Do not fail here tonight.

749
01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:46.851
We are dealing with forces
beyond all human experience...

750
01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:49.020
...an enormous power,
so guard her well.

751
01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:52.816
Otherwise your precious Lucy
will become a bitch of the devil...

752
01:16:52.984 --> 01:16:54.859
...a whore of darkness!

753
01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:58.363
You're a sick old buzzard.

754
01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:01.866
Hear me out, young man.

755
01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:04.411
Lucy is not a random victim
attacked by mere accident.

756
01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:06.162
Do you understand? No.

757
01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:10.417
She is a willing recruit,
a breathless, wanton follower.

758
01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:13.086
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

759
01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:15.714
She is the devil's concubine!

760
01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:18.758
Do you understand me?

761
01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:23.638
Yet, we may still save
her precious soul.

762
01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:27.475
But not on an empty stomach.

763
01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.853
- Jack!
- Here, sir.

764
01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:32.731
I starve. Feed me.

765
01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.358
You old coot!

766
01:19:50.369 --> 01:19:53.538
Your impotent men
with their foolish spells...

767
01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:57.834
...cannot protect you
from my power.

768
01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:13.725
I condemn you to living death...

769
01:20:13.893 --> 01:20:17.020
...to eternal hunger...

770
01:20:17.188 --> 01:20:21.441
...for living blood.

771
01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:58.955
I know how deeply you loved her. That
is why you must trust me and believe.

772
01:21:59.123 --> 01:22:01.249
Believe?
How can I believe?

773
01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:05.128
I want you to bring me, before
nightfall, a set of postmortem knives.

774
01:22:05.296 --> 01:22:07.297
An autopsy? Lucy?

775
01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:11.009
No, not exactly. I just want to cut off
her head and take out her heart.

776
01:22:19.018 --> 01:22:21.853
Diary, 17th September.

777
01:22:22.021 --> 01:22:25.648
Poor Jonathan.
He's still so ill.

778
01:22:25.816 --> 01:22:29.027
He's cheered by
the familiar streets in London.

779
01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:33.364
For me, now that Lucy is dead,
it is a sad homecoming.

780
01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:37.035
It is as if a part of me
is dead too...

781
01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:39.996
...except for the tiny hope
that lives in me...

782
01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:42.624
...that I will again
see my prince.

783
01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.667
Is he here?

784
01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.336
Now that I am married...

785
01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:50.548
...I begin to understand the nature
of my feelings for my strange friend...

786
01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:53.134
...who is always in my thoughts.

787
01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:06.230
Jonathan, what is it?

788
01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:08.274
It is the man himself.

789
01:23:08.442 --> 01:23:10.610
Look, he's grown young.

790
01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:58.658
Gentlemen, must we desecrate
poor Lucy's grave?

791
01:23:58.826 --> 01:24:00.743
She died horribly enough.

792
01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:06.457
If Miss Lucy is dead,
then no wrong can be done to her.

793
01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:09.168
But if she's not dead....

794
01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:11.754
What are you saying, man?
That she's been buried alive?

795
01:24:11.922 --> 01:24:16.926
No. All I say is
she is undead.

796
01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.220
Undead.

797
01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:21.180
This is insane.

798
01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.618
Gentlemen, shall we?

799
01:24:42.786 --> 01:24:45.747
One, two, three.

800
01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:04.515
Where is she?

801
01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:11.856
What have you done with her?

802
01:25:12.024 --> 01:25:14.150
She lives beyond
the grace of God...

803
01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:16.486
...a wanderer in the outer darkness.

804
01:25:16.653 --> 01:25:20.531
She is vampyre, nosferatu.

805
01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:23.659
These creatures do not die
like the bee after the first sting...

806
01:25:23.827 --> 01:25:26.162
...but instead grow strong
and become immortal...

807
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:28.414
...once infected
by another nosferatu.

808
01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:36.839
So my friends,
we fight not one beast...

809
01:25:37.007 --> 01:25:40.384
...but legions that go on
age after age after age...

810
01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:42.553
...feeding on the blood
of the living.

811
01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:51.270
Quickly, hide. Now.

812
01:26:28.267 --> 01:26:31.394
Come to me, Arthur.

813
01:26:31.562 --> 01:26:34.605
Leave these others
and come to me.

814
01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:39.610
My arms are hungry for you,
my darling.

815
01:26:39.778 --> 01:26:43.322
Kiss me and caress me...

816
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:45.783
...my darling husband, please.

817
01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:48.619
We wave Christ
and His holy blood!

818
01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:51.414
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of His might!

819
01:26:55.961 --> 01:26:57.920
The power of God is upon us!

820
01:27:09.975 --> 01:27:12.602
I bring you from shadow
into light!

821
01:27:12.769 --> 01:27:15.813
I cast you out,
the prince of darkness...

822
01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:17.106
...into hell!

823
01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:22.612
A moment's courage,
and it is done.

824
01:27:22.779 --> 01:27:24.655
Take the stake
in your left hand...

825
01:27:26.867 --> 01:27:29.493
...place the point over the heart.

826
01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:35.917
Then in God's name, strike.
Do it now!

827
01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:56.520
Eat, feast. You'll need your strength
for the dark days ahead.

828
01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:02.234
- Doctor?
- Ja?

829
01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:03.986
How did Lucy die?

830
01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:08.282
Well--

831
01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.702
Was she in great pain?

832
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:14.497
Ja, she was in great pain.
Then we cut off her head...

833
01:28:14.665 --> 01:28:17.833
...drove a stake through her heart and
burned it and then she found peace.

834
01:28:18.001 --> 01:28:21.295
Doctor! Please.

835
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.009
So, Mr. Harker...

836
01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:30.054
...I must now ask you,
as your doctor...

837
01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:34.684
...a sensitive question.

838
01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:37.353
During your infidelity
with those creatures...

839
01:28:37.521 --> 01:28:39.021
...those demonic women...

840
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:42.525
...did you, for one instant,
taste of their blood?

841
01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:55.371
Good!

842
01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:58.040
Then you have not infected your blood
with the terrible...

843
01:28:58.208 --> 01:29:00.584
...disease that destroyed poor Lucy.

844
01:29:09.136 --> 01:29:11.762
Doctor, you must understand.

845
01:29:13.432 --> 01:29:15.850
I doubted everything...

846
01:29:16.018 --> 01:29:17.601
...even my mind.

847
01:29:17.769 --> 01:29:19.812
I was impotent with fear.

848
01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.773
- I know.
- But, sir...

849
01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:26.694
...I know where the bastard sleeps.

850
01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:30.531
I brought him there,
to Carfax Abbey.

851
01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:36.912
Vampires do exist.

852
01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.124
And this one we fight,
this one we face...

853
01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:42.793
...has the strength
of 20 or more people...

854
01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:44.962
...and you can testify for that,
Mr. Harker.

855
01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:48.215
But he can also control
the meaner things of life...

856
01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:50.426
...the bat, the rodent, the wolf.

857
01:29:50.594 --> 01:29:54.680
He can appear as mist, as vapor,
as fog and vanish at will.

858
01:29:55.348 --> 01:29:57.349
Now, all these things
Dracula can do...

859
01:29:57.517 --> 01:29:59.143
...but he is not free.

860
01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:02.646
He must rest in the sacred earth
of his homeland to gain his evil power.

861
01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:06.650
It is here that we must find him
and destroy him utterly.

862
01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:09.820
I almost feel pity for anything
so hunted as this count.

863
01:30:09.988 --> 01:30:12.198
How can you pity
such a creature?

864
01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:15.326
I'll take Mina to my quarters.

865
01:30:15.494 --> 01:30:17.953
Good. You'll be safer there.

866
01:30:20.665 --> 01:30:22.958
Mr. Morris, your bullets
will not harm him.

867
01:30:23.126 --> 01:30:26.462
He must be beheaded.
I suggest you use your big bowie knife.

868
01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:29.507
Well, I wasn't planning
on getting that close, Doc.

869
01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:32.343
Master!

870
01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:51.320
Dr. Jack!

871
01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:54.365
I've been promised eternal life!

872
01:30:57.035 --> 01:30:59.328
Dr. Seward, who is that man?

873
01:30:59.496 --> 01:31:01.997
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you,
Madam Mina.

874
01:31:02.165 --> 01:31:05.292
Renfield? I must see him.

875
01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:09.880
Mr. Renfield, behave yourself.

876
01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.218
This is Mrs. Harker.

877
01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:19.723
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

878
01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:22.560
It seems I've been
rather naughty.

879
01:31:25.063 --> 01:31:26.939
I know you.

880
01:31:27.107 --> 01:31:29.024
You're the bride
my master covets.

881
01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:34.238
I have a husband.

882
01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:35.990
I am Mrs. Harker.

883
01:31:37.284 --> 01:31:40.119
My master tells me about you.

884
01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:42.621
What does he tell you?

885
01:31:43.707 --> 01:31:45.207
That he is coming.

886
01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:49.086
That he is coming for you.

887
01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:52.173
Oh, please.

888
01:31:58.263 --> 01:32:00.264
Don't stay here.

889
01:32:00.682 --> 01:32:05.311
Get away from these men, please.

890
01:32:06.688 --> 01:32:10.608
And I pray to God
I may never see your sweet face again.

891
01:32:14.279 --> 01:32:16.906
And may the Lord bless
and keep you.

892
01:32:28.126 --> 01:32:31.795
Master! Master!

893
01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:34.632
You promised me eternal life...

894
01:32:35.091 --> 01:32:38.135
...but you give it
to the pretty woman!

895
01:32:38.303 --> 01:32:40.304
Dr. Jack!

896
01:32:40.472 --> 01:32:42.431
I'm no lunatic man!

897
01:32:42.599 --> 01:32:45.476
I'm a sane man
fighting for his soul!

898
01:32:45.644 --> 01:32:49.521
My quarters are spare, but I think
you will find them comfortable.

899
01:32:49.689 --> 01:32:51.523
Dr. Jack!

900
01:32:51.691 --> 01:32:54.485
Water and toiletries
at your disposal.

901
01:32:56.821 --> 01:32:59.240
You'll be completely safe here.

902
01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:04.888
Destroy every box.
Sterilize the earth inside.

903
01:34:05.056 --> 01:34:06.932
Leave him no refuge.

904
01:34:07.309 --> 01:34:09.560
Let the exorcism begin.

905
01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:42.009
You have betrayed me.

906
01:34:45.972 --> 01:34:47.931
No, master.

907
01:34:52.145 --> 01:34:54.438
I serve you.

908
01:34:54.606 --> 01:34:57.441
I serve only you.

909
01:35:54.874 --> 01:35:58.001
Oh, yes, my love.

910
01:35:58.169 --> 01:36:00.587
You've found me.

911
01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.176
My most precious life.

912
01:36:06.344 --> 01:36:09.430
I have wanted this to happen.

913
01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:11.515
I know that now.

914
01:36:13.351 --> 01:36:16.812
I want to be with you always.

915
01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:21.525
You cannot know
what you are saying.

916
01:36:21.693 --> 01:36:23.652
Yes...

917
01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:25.904
...I do know.

918
01:36:38.793 --> 01:36:42.838
I feared I would never feel
your touch again.

919
01:36:43.006 --> 01:36:44.882
I thought you were dead.

920
01:36:52.056 --> 01:36:56.143
There is no life in this body.

921
01:37:00.273 --> 01:37:02.232
But you live.

922
01:37:03.943 --> 01:37:05.903
You live.

923
01:37:07.572 --> 01:37:09.490
What are you?

924
01:37:10.783 --> 01:37:13.911
I must know.
You must tell me.

925
01:37:21.252 --> 01:37:23.170
I am...

926
01:37:24.589 --> 01:37:26.882
...nothing.

927
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:28.425
Lifeless.

928
01:37:30.428 --> 01:37:32.471
- Soulless.
- What do you mean?

929
01:37:32.639 --> 01:37:35.557
Hated and feared.

930
01:37:36.768 --> 01:37:39.728
I am dead to all the world.

931
01:37:39.896 --> 01:37:41.772
Hear me.

932
01:37:43.775 --> 01:37:45.817
I am the monster...

933
01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:48.070
...that breathing men would kill.

934
01:37:49.447 --> 01:37:52.032
I am Dracula.

935
01:38:07.799 --> 01:38:09.967
You murdered Lucy!

936
01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:25.107
I love you.

937
01:38:26.442 --> 01:38:30.821
Oh, God, forgive me, I do.

938
01:38:49.424 --> 01:38:52.050
I want to be what you are...

939
01:38:52.218 --> 01:38:53.552
...see what you see...

940
01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:55.637
...love what you love.

941
01:38:59.267 --> 01:39:01.810
To walk with me...

942
01:39:01.978 --> 01:39:05.188
...you must die
to your breathing life...

943
01:39:05.356 --> 01:39:08.483
...and be reborn to mine.

944
01:39:08.651 --> 01:39:11.862
You are my love...

945
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:14.656
...and my life always.

946
01:39:22.624 --> 01:39:24.374
Then...

947
01:39:24.542 --> 01:39:26.918
...I give you life eternal...

948
01:39:28.713 --> 01:39:30.714
...everlasting love...

949
01:39:32.258 --> 01:39:36.053
...the power of the storm...

950
01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:39.890
...and the beasts of the earth.

951
01:39:40.058 --> 01:39:42.225
Walk with me...

952
01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:46.063
...to be my loving wife forever.

953
01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:49.024
I will. Yes. Yes.

954
01:40:20.098 --> 01:40:23.016
Drink and join me...

955
01:40:24.102 --> 01:40:26.561
...in eternal life.

956
01:40:41.786 --> 01:40:43.245
I cannot let this be.

957
01:40:44.914 --> 01:40:48.208
Please, I don't care.
Make me yours.

958
01:40:48.376 --> 01:40:52.421
You will be cursed as I am
to walk in the shadow of death...

959
01:40:52.588 --> 01:40:54.297
....for all eternity.

960
01:40:54.465 --> 01:40:59.219
I love you too much...

961
01:40:59.387 --> 01:41:00.804
...to condemn you.

962
01:41:00.972 --> 01:41:06.101
Then take me away
from all this death.

963
01:42:03.367 --> 01:42:06.661
You think you can destroy me...

964
01:42:06.829 --> 01:42:09.164
...with your idols?

965
01:42:12.126 --> 01:42:14.753
Sacred blood of Christ!

966
01:42:14.921 --> 01:42:17.839
I, who served the cross.

967
01:42:18.007 --> 01:42:20.342
I, who commanded nations...

968
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:23.512
...hundreds of years
before you were born.

969
01:42:23.679 --> 01:42:25.680
Your armies were defeated.

970
01:42:25.848 --> 01:42:29.726
You tortured and impaled
thousands of people.

971
01:42:29.894 --> 01:42:33.063
I was betrayed.

972
01:42:33.231 --> 01:42:36.149
Look what your God...

973
01:42:36.317 --> 01:42:39.069
...has done to me.

974
01:42:39.237 --> 01:42:42.239
No, your war with God is over.
You must pay for your crimes.

975
01:42:47.662 --> 01:42:48.912
Christ compels you!

976
01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:52.582
She is now...

977
01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:56.044
...my bride!

978
01:43:00.716 --> 01:43:01.967
More light!

979
01:43:03.761 --> 01:43:07.097
Light! More light!

980
01:43:14.772 --> 01:43:16.022
Unclean.

981
01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:20.277
- Get them!
- This way!

982
01:43:20.444 --> 01:43:21.778
- Get them!
- They must be found.

983
01:43:22.113 --> 01:43:23.113
Unclean.

984
01:43:23.281 --> 01:43:25.615
We have learned something much.

985
01:43:25.783 --> 01:43:29.536
Dracula fears us.
He fears time.

986
01:43:29.704 --> 01:43:32.789
For, if not,
why does he hurry so?

987
01:43:32.957 --> 01:43:35.709
He is gone.

988
01:43:35.877 --> 01:43:38.128
How do you know?

989
01:43:38.296 --> 01:43:41.089
He speaks to me.

990
01:43:42.174 --> 01:43:44.634
He has a strong
mind connection to you.

991
01:43:46.721 --> 01:43:49.639
His heart was strong enough
to survive the grave.

992
01:43:50.933 --> 01:43:54.019
- You admire him.
- Ja.

993
01:43:54.186 --> 01:43:58.481
He was, in life,
a most remarkable man...

994
01:43:58.649 --> 01:44:01.318
...and his mind
was great and powerful...

995
01:44:01.485 --> 01:44:04.446
...but greater is the necessity
to stamp him out...

996
01:44:04.614 --> 01:44:06.489
...and destroy him utterly.

997
01:44:07.658 --> 01:44:09.576
- Doctor?
- Ja?

998
01:44:12.622 --> 01:44:16.291
I know that I am
becoming like him.

999
01:44:16.459 --> 01:44:19.836
Your salvation
is his destruction.

1000
01:44:20.004 --> 01:44:23.715
That is why
I want to hypnotize you.

1001
01:44:23.883 --> 01:44:27.844
I want you to help me find him
before it is too late.

1002
01:44:28.012 --> 01:44:31.514
Please, help me find him.
Please.

1003
01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:34.059
Look into this light...

1004
01:44:34.226 --> 01:44:36.937
...the light of all light,
into this flame.

1005
01:44:38.022 --> 01:44:39.940
Your eyes are heavy.

1006
01:44:41.609 --> 01:44:44.319
You want to sleep.
Sleep now.

1007
01:44:47.323 --> 01:44:51.117
- Sleep.
- I must go to him.

1008
01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:53.620
He calls.

1009
01:44:53.788 --> 01:44:55.205
What do you hear?

1010
01:44:57.541 --> 01:44:59.960
What do you hear, child?

1011
01:45:01.045 --> 01:45:03.672
What do you hear?

1012
01:45:03.839 --> 01:45:07.884
Oh, my prince is calling me.

1013
01:45:08.052 --> 01:45:12.597
He is traveling across icy seas
to his beloved home.

1014
01:45:12.765 --> 01:45:15.892
There he will grow strong again.

1015
01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:19.729
I am coming to him
to partake of his strength.

1016
01:45:25.528 --> 01:45:30.365
We left London by train and crossed
the English Channel in stormy seas...

1017
01:45:30.533 --> 01:45:33.576
...no doubt from the passage
of the count's ship.

1018
01:45:33.744 --> 01:45:38.123
He commands the winds,
but we still have the advantage.

1019
01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:41.918
By train, we can reach the Romanian
port at Varna in three days.

1020
01:45:42.086 --> 01:45:44.754
By ship, it will take him
at least a week.

1021
01:45:46.257 --> 01:45:49.259
From Paris, we traveled
through the Alps to Budapest.

1022
01:45:49.427 --> 01:45:52.012
The count must sail around
the Rock of Gibraltar...

1023
01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:53.930
...where we have posted a lookout...

1024
01:45:54.098 --> 01:45:56.850
...and then on to the Black Sea port
in Varna...

1025
01:45:57.018 --> 01:46:00.311
...where we will meet his ship
and burn it into the sea.

1026
01:46:06.402 --> 01:46:09.529
Home. Home.

1027
01:46:19.290 --> 01:46:22.000
The vampire's baptized her
with his own blood...

1028
01:46:22.168 --> 01:46:24.252
...and her blood is dying,
my friend.

1029
01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:26.296
It is no use.

1030
01:46:38.726 --> 01:46:41.978
I will not let you go
into the unknown alone.

1031
01:46:42.146 --> 01:46:46.357
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.

1032
01:46:46.525 --> 01:46:49.235
Oh, what have I done to you?

1033
01:46:50.946 --> 01:46:54.115
No, I have done this
to both of us.

1034
01:46:54.283 --> 01:46:56.493
I can hear him.
He's coming closer.

1035
01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:58.536
He's calling me to him.

1036
01:47:03.334 --> 01:47:05.710
Stay with me. Please.

1037
01:47:05.878 --> 01:47:07.796
I am so cold.

1038
01:47:20.101 --> 01:47:21.476
All aboard!

1039
01:47:21.644 --> 01:47:25.313
Noon. Holmwood received a wire
from his clerk at Lloyd's.

1040
01:47:25.481 --> 01:47:28.483
The count's ship sailed past us
in the night fog...

1041
01:47:28.651 --> 01:47:30.485
...to the northern port of Galatz.

1042
01:47:30.653 --> 01:47:33.822
The black devil
is reading Mina's mind.

1043
01:47:33.989 --> 01:47:36.491
How can we catch him now?

1044
01:47:44.458 --> 01:47:46.876
Varna. Galatz.

1045
01:47:47.044 --> 01:47:48.711
It's about 200 miles.

1046
01:47:48.879 --> 01:47:51.047
I think that with the horses,
we can cut him off...

1047
01:47:51.215 --> 01:47:53.049
...reach him before
he reaches the castle.

1048
01:47:53.217 --> 01:47:56.219
I will dispatch Van Helsing
straight for the Borgo Pass.

1049
01:47:56.387 --> 01:47:57.887
If we fail in our task...

1050
01:47:58.055 --> 01:47:59.931
...you will have to finish him.

1051
01:48:04.812 --> 01:48:08.064
From Varna, Mina and Van Helsing
took a carriage...

1052
01:48:08.232 --> 01:48:10.942
...and we continued
on the train towards Galatz...

1053
01:48:11.110 --> 01:48:14.904
...where we still hoped to intercept
the count before he reaches land.

1054
01:48:15.072 --> 01:48:19.826
I am fearful for Mina.
She is now our decoy.

1055
01:48:32.256 --> 01:48:34.048
I know this place.

1056
01:48:34.216 --> 01:48:36.926
- The end of the world.
- We must go on.

1057
01:48:37.094 --> 01:48:38.928
It is late, child.
We must rest here now.

1058
01:48:39.096 --> 01:48:41.556
No, we must go!

1059
01:48:41.724 --> 01:48:43.349
He needs me.
We must go!

1060
01:48:47.855 --> 01:48:49.731
We have passed Bistritza.

1061
01:48:49.899 --> 01:48:52.567
Dracula has outsmarted us again.

1062
01:48:52.735 --> 01:48:56.446
We learned that his gypsies took
charge of the vampire's box at Galatz...

1063
01:48:56.614 --> 01:49:00.200
...and are now on
the Borgo Pass road.

1064
01:49:16.133 --> 01:49:19.594
- Here. You must eat.
- I am not hungry.

1065
01:50:11.772 --> 01:50:14.774
You have been so good to me,
Professor.

1066
01:50:24.368 --> 01:50:28.204
I know that Lucy harbored
secret desires for you.

1067
01:50:28.372 --> 01:50:30.748
She told me.

1068
01:50:30.916 --> 01:50:33.960
I, too, know what men desire.

1069
01:50:50.602 --> 01:50:52.478
Will you cut off my head...

1070
01:50:52.646 --> 01:50:54.564
...and drive a stake
through my heart...

1071
01:50:54.732 --> 01:50:58.067
...as you did poor Lucy,
you murdering bastard?

1072
01:51:02.156 --> 01:51:05.616
Not while I live.
I am sworn to protect you.

1073
01:51:22.384 --> 01:51:24.802
You are safe within the circle.

1074
01:51:24.970 --> 01:51:28.473
I've lost Lucy.
I'll not lose you to him.

1075
01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:29.974
You're whores of Satan!

1076
01:51:34.271 --> 01:51:36.230
This is holy ground.

1077
01:51:36.398 --> 01:51:38.232
Leave this place now!

1078
01:51:40.235 --> 01:51:42.278
Leave!

1079
01:51:42.946 --> 01:51:45.656
In the name of God,
leave this ground!

1080
01:51:45.824 --> 01:51:47.742
I command you
in the name of Christ!

1081
01:51:59.797 --> 01:52:02.715
Christ! Damn you!

1082
01:52:39.837 --> 01:52:41.796
Dracul!

1083
01:53:20.544 --> 01:53:22.587
You are...

1084
01:53:22.754 --> 01:53:25.047
...near.

1085
01:53:25.215 --> 01:53:27.133
My love.

1086
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:40.605
They're racing
against the sunset.

1087
01:53:40.772 --> 01:53:42.732
It may be too late.
God help us.

1088
01:54:24.191 --> 01:54:25.566
Harker, shoot!

1089
01:54:34.326 --> 01:54:36.035
Charge!

1090
01:57:17.698 --> 01:57:20.324
When my time comes,
will you do the same to me?

1091
01:57:23.495 --> 01:57:24.578
Will you?

1092
01:57:31.086 --> 01:57:32.503
- Wait.
- Let them go.

1093
01:57:32.671 --> 01:57:36.507
Let them go.
Our work is finished here.

1094
01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:38.926
Hers has just begun.

1095
01:58:03.118 --> 01:58:05.828
We've all become God's madmen.

1096
01:58:08.331 --> 01:58:10.249
All of us.

1097
01:58:19.509 --> 01:58:23.304
Where is my God?

1098
01:58:23.472 --> 01:58:26.682
He has forsaken me.

1099
01:58:32.898 --> 01:58:36.192
It is finished.

1100
01:58:38.195 --> 01:58:40.154
My love.

1101
01:58:44.493 --> 01:58:45.826
My love.

1102
01:58:54.169 --> 01:58:56.587
There, in the presence of God...

1103
01:58:56.755 --> 01:58:59.673
...I understood at last
how my love could release us all...

1104
01:58:59.841 --> 01:59:01.717
...from the powers of darkness.

1105
01:59:08.058 --> 01:59:10.643
Our love is stronger than death.

1106
01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:21.737
Give me peace.
